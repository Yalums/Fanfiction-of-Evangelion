In a place on the very cusp between Time and that greater reality beyond, there was a room. A small, dark, comfortable room, mostly taken up with a great canopied bed of carven wood. In that bed, three women slept nestled together. Their age was indeterminate- one observer might have thought them barely more than children, while to another they might seem aged, and to a third in their prime. Their faces bore a resemblance, although one would have been hard pressed to judge if it was the born similarity of sisters or the grown similarity of those who have shared life and laughter and toil and tears. Their expressions were quite peaceful.  
在时间与更广阔现实交界的边缘，有一间屋子。这间狭小、昏暗却温馨的房间，主要被一张雕刻华丽的巨大幔帐床占据。床上，三位女子相依而眠。她们的年龄难以捉摸——有人可能觉得她们不过是少女，也有人可能认为她们已显老态，还有人可能觉得她们正值青春。她们的面容有几分相似，但难以断定这是天生的姐妹相，还是共同经历生活、欢笑、辛劳与泪水后形成的相似。她们的表情十分宁静。

One stirred, and opened her eyes. For a moment, she lay still. Then, sighing at the necessity, she carefully extricated herself from her heart-sisters' sweet-smelling embrace. She smiled to see them huddle together, taking up the space she had left.  
她动了动，睁开双眼。片刻间，她静静地躺着。随后，她轻叹一声，小心翼翼地从心姐妹们散发着芬芳的怀抱中脱身。看到她们挤在一起填补她留下的空位，她露出了微笑。

She stepped through the wall, into a marbled room with a pool of warm water sunk into its floor. Rose petals floated on the surface. Although unnecessary, the bath was comforting. She sank to the bottom, holding her breath for the pleasant pretense of it. The effect would have been spoilt entirely had she remained there too long, so after a minute she rose to the surface and floated on her back, eyes closed.  
她穿墙而入，来到一间大理石打造的房间，地面中央嵌着一池温水，玫瑰花瓣漂浮其上。沐浴虽非必需，却带来莫大的慰藉。她沉入水底，屏息体验这份愉悦的假象。若久留水下，这份美好便会荡然无存，因此一分钟后，她浮上水面，闭目仰泳。

"Ah, there's no use putting it off, is there?" she said aloud at last, in an archaic Greek which wove its way through both her best and least beloved memories. She rose from the water, wrung out her hair, and began to braid it. She willed one of the walls into mirror-brightness, and fixed her own image in her mind: the clean brown hair and small firm breasts and solid hips, the strong smooth-skinned body, the hands strong and callused with honest work. Her true self, shared with her heart-sisters, not the cruel caricature she became on her missions.  
"唉，拖延也无济于事，不是吗？" 她终于大声说道，用的是古希腊语，这种语言穿梭在她最美好和最不喜欢的记忆之间。她从水中起身，拧干头发，开始编辫子。她让一面墙变得如镜般明亮，凝视着自己的倒影：干净利落的棕色头发、小巧结实的胸部、结实的臀部，以及强壮、皮肤光滑的身体，双手因辛勤工作而变得粗糙。这是她真实的自己，与心姐妹们共享，而非执行任务时变成的残酷讽刺形象。

At last she called to her uniform, and it came obediently to her. Not a cowled robe, this time, nor a mannish kilt and breastplate. Not heavy space armour, nor the fitted tunic and trousers which were/are/would be fashionable on a distant planet settled by Gaia's children in the third millennium of their diaspora. A long black coat, surplus from some unknown military, breeches and blouse of the same color, heavy calf-high boots, and a black beret. She looked at her reflection through gentle blue eyes and turned away. In the bedroom she paused to kiss her sleeping loves before walking through the opposite wall.  
最终，她呼唤自己的制服，它便顺从地来到她身边。这次并非带兜帽的长袍，也不是男式短裙与胸甲。不是沉重的太空盔甲，亦非在第三千年由盖亚子孙定居的遥远星球上流行的合身束腰外衣与长裤。而是一件长长的黑色军大衣，来自某个不为人知的军队，搭配同色的马裤和衬衫，厚重的及膝长靴，以及一顶黑色贝雷帽。她透过温柔的蓝眼睛凝视自己的倒影，随即转身离去。在卧室里，她停下脚步，轻吻了沉睡中的爱人，然后穿墙而过。

It was hot and muggy; had she truly been a mortal, her clothing would have been soaked with sweat within a minute. A few birds floated lazily through the air. She stood on a street corner in a great city, curiously empty of the crowds she remembered from other missions in similar settings. Maybe there was a war on.  
天气闷热潮湿，若她真是凡人，不出一分钟衣衫定会被汗水浸透。几只鸟儿悠闲地在空中飘荡。她站在一座大城市的街角，奇怪的是这里空无一人，与她在以往类似任务中所见的人潮涌动截然不同。或许正逢战事。

She laughed a bitter professional's laugh. There was always a war on, somewhere in the world. She looked up at the looming buildings of concrete and glass and steel. They were ugly, but no uglier than many others; she'd seen hovels in the ruins of cities and palaces built by lords with more money than taste, in times that were both before and after this one.  
她发出了一声职业人士的苦涩笑声。世界上总有某个角落战火纷飞。她抬头仰望那些由混凝土、玻璃和钢铁构成的巍峨建筑。它们虽显丑陋，却也不比其他许多建筑更甚；她曾目睹过城市废墟中的破败小屋，也见识过在今昔之前和之后，那些财富过剩而品味不足的贵族所建的华丽宫殿。

She looked up at a sign, reading the foreign characters as easily as the Cretan syllabary or the Ionian alphabet; absently, she wondered what "Yebisu Beer" might taste like. She sniffed at the air, caught the scent of greed and murder, and went on her way, trying very hard not to look at her reflection in the shop windows.  
她抬头望向一块招牌，轻松辨认着上面的外文，如同阅读克里特音节文字或爱奥尼亚字母般自如；她心不在焉地琢磨，“惠比寿啤酒”尝起来会是何等滋味。她嗅了嗅空气，捕捉到贪婪与杀戮的气息，便继续前行，极力避免在商店橱窗中看到自己的倒影。

Ikari Gendou sat in his office, fingers steepled on his desk, staring at the wall. Had someone seen him, they would have said he was deep in thought; had that someone known his reputation, they would have said he was planning the next battle against the Angels, or perhaps the next twist in his complex struggle against Seele.  
碇源堂坐在办公室内，双手十指交叉置于桌上，目光凝视着墙壁。旁人若见此景，或许会认为他正陷入沉思；若知其威名，则可能猜测他正在谋划下一场与使徒的较量，或是他对抗 Seele 复杂斗争中的下一个策略。

But in truth, his mind was occupied with neither the otherwordly forces who warred on the Earth nor with the secret society whose dark agenda ran sometimes in unison and sometimes in counterpoint with his own. Rather, he was remembering a spring day some thirteen years in the past. It had been noted by his son, among others, that Gendou kept pictures neither of the wife he had lost nor of the child he had given up. Most of these observers assumed he was simply a heartless villain with all the human feelings of a mako shark.  
然而，他的思绪并未停留在地球上争斗的超自然力量，也未关注那个与他自己的阴谋时而同步、时而对立的秘密组织。他心中浮现的是大约十三年前的一个春日。他的儿子及旁人发现，源堂并未保留已故妻子的照片，也未留下他放弃的孩子的影像。多数人因此断定他是个冷血的恶人，人性之缺失堪比大白鲨。

While this last was in some degree true, it was not the cause of his failure to remind himself of the past with photographs. He simply didn't need them. Right now he could see the child in his wife's lap, the chubby toothless smile, the little hand that reached out to grab his fingers, the soft eyes of the only person he'd ever loved, the cherry blossoms blowing in the breeze...  
虽然最后这一点确实有些道理，但这并非他没有借助照片来唤起对过去的回忆的原因。他根本不需要它们。此刻，他眼前浮现出孩子坐在妻子膝上的情景，那圆润的无牙笑脸，伸出的小手紧紧抓住他的手指，以及他唯一深爱的人那柔和的眼神，还有随风轻舞的樱花……

He became aware that there was a woman in the room. Not a vision of Yui, such as he'd sometimes had, but a woman in black. Her face was scarred and weathered, her long hair the colour of dried blood, her fingernails sharp claws. Her blued-steel eyes were laser drills boring into his.  
他察觉到房间内有一位女子，并非他偶尔幻想中的结衣，而是一位身着黑衣的女性。她的面容布满疤痕，皮肤历经风霜，长发呈干血般的色泽，指甲尖利如爪。她那蓝钢色的眼眸，犹如激光钻般直刺他的心灵。

He settled back in his chair. "I presume you're from Seele, miss?" Quite casually his hand reached for the hidden drawer, the one with the gun in it.  
他往后一靠，坐在椅子上，问道：“小姐，我猜您是来自塞勒吧？”说话间，他的手不经意地伸向了藏着枪的暗抽屉。

"No."

"Who sent you? The JSSDF are a pack of buffoons- I've known one of their agents for years, and the man is a joke, a character out of a bad anime show. The Americans and Russians are worse, and everyone else is out of the picture."  
谁派你来的？日本自卫队简直是一群无能之辈——我认识他们其中一名特工多年，那人就是个笑柄，活像劣质动画里的人物。美国人和俄罗斯人更不堪，其他人则根本不值一提。

"I've nothing to do with any of them."  
我与他们任何人都没有瓜葛。

"Whom do you work for?"  
您为哪家公司工作？

"Fate. Justice. The forces of Good."  
命运、正义与善的力量。

"Very funny. If you asked me about myself, I'd probably say the same thing." The drawer was sticking. Not that it really mattered; he could handle this maniac without any firepower at all. The silenced 10mm with its soft-pointed slugs was merely insurance. "Anyhow, Miss Force of Good, what are you here to do?"  
真有意思。要是你问我对自己的看法，我大概也会这么回答。抽屉卡住了，但这无关紧要；对付这个疯子，他根本无需动用武器。那把装填软尖弹的消音 10 毫米手枪，不过是多一层保障。“那么，正义小姐，你此行有何贵干？”

"Kill you." 要你的命。

"It's been tried." 已经试过了。

"Only by humans." She was short, he noticed, barely a hundred and fifty-five. He felt a vague irritation with himself for the irrelevant thought.  
"只有人类才能做到。"他注意到她个子很矮，大概只有一百五十五厘米。他对自己冒出这种无关紧要的想法感到有些恼火。

"I could have sworn you were a human yourself."  
我差点以为你也是人类。

"Appearances can be deceiving. And don't bother with your weapon; you can't get the drawer open, and even if you could it would be useless."  
外表往往具有欺骗性。别费劲用武器了，你打不开抽屉，即便打开了，武器也派不上用场。

"Who are you?" 请问您是谁？

"My name is Megaera." She reached out; he felt an intolerable pain, as if his heart was being squeezed in his chest. "Yui..." he whispered.  
"我叫墨盖拉。"她伸出手，他顿时感到一阵钻心的痛楚，仿佛心脏被紧紧攥住。"结..."他轻声呢喃。

The killer turned her back on his body and left the way she'd came. There were more prey to be found.  
杀手背对尸体，沿着来路离去，还有更多猎物待她去发现。

There were birds singing in the park. Ikari Shinji sat down on a bench to listen. It wasn't so much that he was fond of birdsong as that he had nothing else to do at the moment. No tests were scheduled at Nerv this afternoon, and if he went home there would be nothing but Misato snoring and Pen-Pen hogging the bathroom. His friends were with their families, while his fellow pilots had gone off on their separate ways: Rei to gods-knew-where and Asuka to the mall. He linked his hands behind his head and closed his eyes.  
公园里鸟儿在歌唱。碇真嗣坐到长椅上，静静聆听。他并非特别钟情于鸟鸣，只是此刻别无他事。NERV 今天下午没有测试安排，回家也只会听到葛城美里的鼾声和企鹅 Pen-Pen 霸占浴室的情景。朋友们都与家人团聚，而其他驾驶员也各奔东西：绫波丽不知所踪，明日香去了商场。他双手枕在脑后，闭目养神。

A weight settled down beside him on the bench. He wouldn't have cared if he hadn't felt the warmth of the body associated with that weight, sitting far too close to be a stranger. It was probably Asuka, happening by and deciding to play a trick. Not to wrap her arms about him and lay her head on his shoulder, of course; that only happened in dreams. He opened his eyes.  
一个重量悄然落座在他身旁的长椅上。若非那紧邻的体温，他或许不会在意。这多半是明日香，偶然路过，心血来潮想捉弄他一番。自然，她不会真的搂住他，将头枕在他肩上；那般情景，只存在于梦中。他缓缓睁开双眼。

The person sitting next to him wasn't Asuka. Nor was it Misato. Nor Rei. She might have been his own age, or a few years older. Despite the heat of the day, she wore heavy black clothing of a vaguely military cut, like something an anime character might wear. She was looking directly at him, a smile of peculiar sweetness quirking her lips. "Hello?" he said cautiously.  
坐在他身旁的人并非明日香，亦非美里，更不是绫波。她或许与他年纪相仿，或是稍长几岁。即便天气酷热，她仍身着厚实的黑色军装风格服饰，宛如动漫中的人物装扮。她直勾勾地看着他，唇边漾起一抹别样的甜美微笑。“你好？”他谨慎地开口。

"You can see me?"  
你能看到我吗？

---

Megaera sighed. A long day of hunting and killing was finally over. She had avenged billions of lives over the past several hours, but she felt like vomiting. Alas, that was one mortal comfort denied her. As was getting drunk.  
墨盖拉长叹一声。漫长而血腥的狩猎日终于落下帷幕。她为数十亿生灵复仇，心中却涌起一股恶心感。可惜，这种凡人的慰藉并不属于她，就连借酒消愁也无法实现。

The city was called Tokyo-3. She wondered what had happened to the first two. Probably destroyed and rebuilt- mortals did that, although this habit of sticking numbers onto the end of the name was unusual. Usually they kept the old one, or else whoever had taken the place called it something completely different.  
这座城市名为东京 3 号。她不禁好奇，前两座东京遭遇了何种命运。多半已被摧毁，而后重建——凡人常有此举，然而在名称后附加数字的做法实属少见。通常情况下，人们会沿用旧名，或者占领者会赋予其一个全新的名字。

There was a small grassy space with trees and benches and a fountain, a welcome relief among the concrete. The wind brought the scent of growth to her, and she smiled, remembering happier times when she and her heart-sisters had gone in mortal guise, dancing in Arcadian meadows, swimming in brooks, sometimes finding a pretty and willing lad or lass.  
那里有一片小巧的草地，树木、长椅和喷泉错落有致，为混凝土世界带来一丝清新。微风携带着生机勃勃的气息，她不禁微笑，回想起与挚友化作凡人，在阿卡迪亚的草地上翩翩起舞，在溪水中嬉戏，偶遇俊美而心甘情愿的少男少女的欢乐时光。

As it happened, there was a fetching young fellow sitting alone. His hair was shorter than she liked, and she didn't think much of his dull clothes, but she quite fancied his face.  
恰巧，一位英俊的年轻人独自坐在那里。他的发型比她偏爱的短，衣着也显得有些单调，不过他的面容却颇得她心。

He wouldn't see her, of course; the mortals here didn't, save for her targets. She remembered a philosopher who'd talked of humans' ability to ignore whatever they knew didn't exist. It wasn't a bad thing; in other times she'd never get within a dozen paces, not in her present form. She would sit down beside him and rest for a moment.  
他自然看不见她，这里的凡人除了她的目标，都无法看见她。她记得有位哲学家提到过，人类有一种能力，可以忽视那些他们明知不存在的事物。这并非坏事；若非如此，以她当前的形态，她根本无法接近他十步之内。她会坐在他身旁，稍作休息。

He smelled nice. She'd move just a hair closer- if he felt her at all, he'd only think there'd been a sudden current of air.  
他身上散发着好闻的气息。她会不自觉地稍稍靠近——若他有所察觉，也只会以为是突然掠过的一阵风。

---

"Yes. Why shouldn't I?" 当然可以。我为什么不应该呢？

Her tone was incredulous. "Because at least fifty people today haven't."  
她语气中带着怀疑：“因为今天至少有五十人还没这么做。”

"Oh." He realised that her face was heavily scarred. It wasn't right that people ignored her because of something she couldn't help. Touji-kun's sister was scarred because of his own incompetence. "I'm sorry."  
哦。" 他注意到她脸上布满了疤痕。仅仅因为她无法控制的事情而被人忽视，这实在不公。透二的妹妹之所以有这些疤痕，全因他的无能。"对不起。

She smiled. "It's not _your_ fault." She had a nice voice. Maybe it was a little bit like what Asuka's would be if she weren't angry all the time. Or Rei's, if she had more emotion. Or even Misato's, if she were sober and unstressed.  
她微笑着安慰道：“这不是你的错。”她的嗓音悦耳动听。或许有点像明日香若不常怒气冲冲时的声音，或者像绫波若情感更丰富一些，甚至像美里若她清醒且放松时的声音。

They sat quietly for some minutes. Shinji pretended to watch the pigeons, all the while stealing quick glances at the stranger beside him.  
他们静坐片刻，真嗣佯装关注鸽群，实则频频偷瞥身旁的陌生人。

---

She didn't often meet genuinely likeable people; it was one of the drawbacks of her profession. All the more reason to get to know this one. "So, do you come here often?"  
她鲜少遇到真正让人喜欢的人，这正是她职业的缺憾之一。因此，更应该好好了解眼前这位。“对了，你常来这儿吗？”

He started like a horse at the sound of a broken branch. _Perhaps this is one of those places where strangers don't talk much._ "Not really."  
他一听到树枝断裂的声响，便如惊马般跳起。或许这里正是那种陌生人之间少言寡语的地方。“其实也不尽然。”

"'Tis pity. It's one of the prettiest spots I've seen here."  
真可惜。这里是我见过的最美的地方之一。

"Oh."

_Silly boy, ask me a question._ He didn't. "So, are you from here?"  
傻小子，怎么不问我个问题呢。他没问。“那么，你是这里人吗？”

"Not really." 并不真实。

"I'm not, myself. Just passing through. What brings you here?"  
我并非本地人，只是路过而已。你来这儿有何贵干？

"I didn't have anything else to do."  
我没什么别的事要做。

She laughed. "I meant to this city."  
她笑道：“我指的是这座城市。”

"Well... my father told me to come here..."  
我父亲让我来这里的。

---

_Why am I telling her all this?_ Shinji thought. It didn't make any sense; he'd never been much for opening up to people at all, particularly complete strangers. She was like... an old friend he'd never met before.  
为什么我要向她吐露这一切？真嗣暗自思忖。这实在说不通；他向来不习惯与人深谈，更别提对陌生人了。她给他的感觉，就仿佛是一位素未谋面的旧友。

A flash of red drew his attention. "I'm sorry," he said quietly.  
一抹红色闪光引起了他的注意。“抱歉，”他低声说道。

---

A sudden flare of anger lit up the ambient. Megaera's senses reached out to the adorable redhead at its center. _Ah, I see. It's that girl he was talking about. The one with the temper._  
一阵怒火突然爆发，照亮了四周。墨盖拉的感知立刻捕捉到了中心那位可爱的红发女孩。哦，原来如此。就是他之前提到的那位女孩，那个脾气火爆的。

"Whyever for?" she queried.  
"究竟是为什么呢？"她问道。

"She's going to throw a fit. You'll probably catch some of it."  
她要大发脾气了。你恐怕也会受到牵连。

"Not if I can help it," she said. Then, raising her voice, "Why don't you come over and join us? There's plenty of room."  
如果我能帮上忙就不会这样了，"她提高声音说，"你何不过来一起坐？这里很宽敞。

Her eyes widened. "Excuse me?"  
她瞪大了眼睛。“你说什么？”

Megaera patted the bench. "Sit between us, why don't you?"  
墨盖拉轻拍长椅，说道：“坐到我们中间来吧。”

"Ummm- " 嗯...

"Sit! I certainly don't bite, and I don't think your friend does, does he?"  
坐吧！我当然不会咬人，你朋友应该也不会吧？

"Ah, well, no..." the girl stammered as she settled into place.  
"哎，这个，还是不了……"女孩有些结巴地坐了下来。

_She's off balance, so we'll just give her another little push to keep her there._ "At least not _hard_, I suspect. Maybe you'd have a better idea?"  
她现在摇摇欲坠，我们只需再轻轻推一把，让她继续保持不稳。“应该不会太用力，你觉得呢？或许你有更妙的办法？”

Both of them flushed. The effect was fetching.  
两人都面露红晕，显得格外动人。

"So, you're Asuka, right?"  
所以，你就是明日香吧？

"Errr... yeah." 嗯... 对。

"Call me Meg." 叫我梅格吧。

"Commander Ikari?" Ayanami Rei knocked at the heavy wooden door. There was no response. After a moment, she reached for the knob.  
"碇司令？"绫波丽轻敲那扇厚实的木门。未闻回音。片刻后，她伸手触碰门把。

"Commander?" He was slumped over the desk. No wonder; he'd been very busy lately. Her business wasn't important enough to wake him. She sat down in a straight-backed wooden chair to wait.  
"指挥官？" 他疲惫地趴在桌上，最近忙得不可开交。考虑到自己的事并不紧急，她决定不打扰他，便坐在一旁的直背木椅上静静等待。

---

Asuka giggled. It was a nice sound, very different to her usual mocking laugh. She really was cute.  
明日香咯咯地笑了起来，那声音很是动听，与她平日里的讥笑大相径庭。她确实很可爱。

And so was Meg, scars or no. _Stop it_, a small voice whispered inside him. _Asuka's right when she calls you a pervert. It was bad enough when it was just her and Ayanami and Misato-san._  
梅格亦是如此，伤疤与否。“别这样，”他心底有个细小的声音在劝诫。明日香说你是变态，她没错。当只有她和绫波以及美里小姐在场时，情况已经够糟糕了。

---

It had been nearly two hours. The Commander had a meeting that afternoon. She had best to wake him.  
已经过去将近两个小时了。指挥官那天下午要开会，她最好把他叫醒。

"Sir?" No response. "Commander Ikari?"  
先生？"无人应答。"伊卡里指挥官？

She laid her hand carefully on his shoulder. "I'm sorry, Commander." He didn't like to be touched.  
她轻柔地把手搭在他的肩上，轻声道：“抱歉，指挥官。”他向来不喜欢别人触碰。

No reaction. She shook lightly. His head lolled to the side, eyes open. She had seen that look before, somewhere.  
她毫无反应，只是轻轻摇了摇头。他的头无力地歪向一侧，双眼睁开。她记得曾在某处见过这样的神情。

"Commander? 指挥官？

"Sir?

"Father?!" 爸爸?!

---

Meg smiled, and her battered face was a thing of radiant beauty. "Oh, Emil Fischbein Strasse! In Heidelburg? I've been there. Tell me, is that wonderful patisserie still in business?"  
梅格微笑着，尽管面容带伤，却难掩其灿烂之美。“哦，埃米尔·菲施拜因大街！是在海德堡吧？我曾去过。请问，那家迷人的糕点店还在营业吗？”

"The one across from Sankt Cornelius Kirche?"  
是在圣康拉德教堂对面的那个吗？

"No, that was a gunsmith's when I was there. The place I'm thinking of was near the park. The one where the duels were fought, yes?"  
不，我记得那里以前是家枪匠铺。我指的是靠近公园的那个地方，就是经常有决斗的那个地方，没错吧？

Asuka blinked. _Duels? Gunsmith? When was that?_ "I don't think I remember that one."  
明日香眨了眨眼，疑惑地问道：“决斗？枪匠？这是什么时候的事？我好像记不起来了。”

"It has been a long time. Tell me, does the one you were talking about make good linzertorte?" Meg draped her arm about her shoulders, and she forgot her puzzlement. No one had been this close to her in so long... not since Bernadette. It felt nice. Except something was missing. Before she quite realised what she was doing, she reached out and pulled Shinji against her other side. He resisted a moment before relaxing into her grip. That was better.  
"好久不见了。说说看，你之前提到的那位做的林茨蛋糕味道如何？"梅格的手臂轻轻搭在她的肩上，她心中的困惑随之消散。已经很久没有人如此亲近她了...自从伯纳黛特离开后。这种感觉真好。只是似乎还缺了点什么。在她意识到之前，她已经伸出手，将真嗣拉到自己另一侧。他起初有些抗拒，但很快便放松下来，依偎在她怀中。这样感觉更完整了。

"Yes, but their creampuffs are the best." Shinji's arm slipped around her back. Much better. She'd never touched him before, except as a joke. That was a mistake: he was cuddly. She should have done this a long time ago. And maybe sometime soon she'd do something more. _No! He's a wimp, and a pervert, and he'll tell those stupid boys everything_, some tiny part of her mind screamed in a last desperate bid for life, before being squashed entirely. _He isn't, he's not, and he won't._ She rubbed her cheek against first his shoulder, then Meg's.  
"没错，他们的奶油泡芙确实一流。" 真嗣的手臂自然地环抱住她的背。感觉好多了。她以前除了开玩笑，从未真正与他亲近过。那是个失误：他其实很讨人喜欢。她早该这么做了。或许不久后，她还会有更进一步的举动。不！他是个胆小鬼，还是个色狼，他会把一切都告诉那些蠢小子，她内心深处的一丝声音在绝望中尖叫，试图挣扎，但最终被彻底淹没。他不是那样的人，他不会那么做。她先是脸颊贴着他的肩膀蹭了蹭，接着又蹭了蹭梅格的。

*One hundred.* 一百。

*One hundred one.* 一百零一。

*One hundred two.* 一百零二。

Rei counted the flights of stairs as she made her way out of the Geofront. She had passed five elevators as she made her way her way to this emergency exit.  
丽一边数着楼梯，一边从 Geofront 撤离。她在前往紧急出口的途中，已经路过了五部电梯。

---

"So," Asuka said, "what's brought you here, Meg?"  
那么，" 明日香问道，"梅格，你来这儿是有什么事吗？

"Business." 业务。

"How... mysterious," Asuka said. "But there's only one kind of business in Tokyo-3. Hmm.. are you a new pilot?"  
真是...神秘呢，" 明日香说。"不过东京-3 这里只有一类生意。嗯...你是新加入的驾驶员吗？

"No."

"Didn't think so," Shinji said. "Eva pilots are, by definition, messed up. Meg, on the other hand, is practically sane. So..."  
我也没想到，" 真嗣说道，"毕竟 Eva 驾驶员，按理说，心理状态都不太稳定。但梅格，相比之下，算是相当理智了。所以...

Asuka giggled. "I'll show you practically sane." She began to tickle him, just below his ribcage. "See? If I were insane, I'd be snogging-eee!" He counterattacked, finding the vulnerable spots just below her armpits. "If I were-ooo-insane, Ikari Shinji, I'd-haheeha-be snogging you senseless."  
明日香咯咯笑着说：“我来给你展示一下什么叫基本正常。”她开始挠他的肋骨下方。“瞧，如果我疯了，我就会亲你——哎呀！”他反击了，找到了她腋下的弱点。“如果我——哈哈哈——疯了，碇真嗣，我就会亲得你神魂颠倒。”

"Whereas," he said, catching her wrists in his hands, "if you were completely sane..." she let him mock-pin her against the bench.  
"然而，"他边说边抓住她的手腕，"如果你真的神志清醒……"她便让他假装把她按在长凳上。

"I'd be snogging you _and_ Meg senseless."  
我会吻得你和梅格晕头转向。

Meg leaned close enough to whisper and be heard by both boy and girl. "So, let's see how sane you are, lovely Asuka."  
梅格凑近到能低声说话，让男孩和女孩都听得见的程度。“那么，让我们瞧瞧你有多理智，亲爱的明日香。”

---

The dim glow of a single fluorescent tube lit up the exit at the top of the stairs, barely overpowering the phosphorescent emergency markers. Rei pushed open the door and stepped out into the alleyway between a dim sum restaurant and the Tokyo-3 branch of the Banque Populaire de la Nouvelle Acadie. She stood for a moment in the shadows, letting her eyes adapt to the light, before making her way to the street.  
一盏荧光灯管的黯淡光线照亮了楼梯顶端的出口，仅能勉强压过荧光紧急指示灯的光芒。Rei 推开门，步入点心餐厅与东京-3 新阿卡迪亚人民银行分行间的巷弄。她在暗影中稍作停留，让双眼适应外界的光线，随后才迈向街道。

Out in the sunlight, birds drifted overhead. A monorail glid by, the sound of its passage barely a whisper in the still air. She felt herself dehydrated. The park three blocks away had a water fountain.  
阳光下，鸟儿悠然飞过头顶。单轨列车悄然滑过，其声响在静谧的空气中几不可闻。她感到口渴难耐。三个街区外的公园里设有饮水喷泉。

Shinji knew that girls sometimes kissed each other. The boys at school whispered rumours about sleepover parties and snogging, and sometimes images made the rounds, by email and from hand to hand on scraps of glossy paper. Aida had a small collection from the centre sections of car magazines.  
真嗣知道，女孩子之间有时会亲吻。学校里的男生们私下里议论着过夜派对和亲吻的流言，偶尔还会通过电子邮件或手手相传的光面纸片传播一些图片。爱田收藏了一些从汽车杂志中间部分剪下的图片。

The pictures made him doubt the rumours; the girls in tiny bikinis and heavy makeup, high heels and too-small school frocks, all looked tired and bored, as if they were stocking shelves or dishing out ramen takeaway. Evidently, he'd thought, girls didn't _like_ to kiss other girls.  
这些照片使他对谣言心生疑窦：那些身着迷你比基尼、浓妆艳抹、脚踩高跟鞋、穿着过小校服裙的女孩们，个个显得疲惫且无趣，宛如她们正在货架上整理货物或分发拉面外卖。显然，他曾以为，女孩们并不热衷于亲吻同性。

This was nothing like the pictures. Asuka's eyes were closed, and her face was soft and relaxed. Meg's eyes were open, completely intent upon Asuka, and even the scars on her cheek were lovely in the soft light of afternoon filtered through trees.  
这与照片中的情景大相径庭。明日香双眼紧闭，面容柔和，显得十分放松。梅格则目不转睛地注视着明日香，她脸颊上的疤痕在树影婆娑的午后阳光下，竟也显得分外动人。

She heard voices and laughter through the splashing of the park's small fountain. Two familiar voices, and another. Ikari and Souryuu and someone else. A female, their own age or a little older. An unfamiliar emotion ran through her, tensing the muscles of her belly and souring her stomach, making a tight knot in her breast. She had read the words "heart-ache," but they had never meant anything before.  
她听到公园小喷泉的溅水声中传来说话声和笑声。两个熟悉的声音，还有另一个。是碇和苍龙，还有一位女性，年纪与他们相仿或稍长。一种陌生的情感涌上心头，让她腹部紧绷，胃里感到不适，胸口仿佛打了个结。她曾读到过“心痛”这个词，但直到此刻才真正体会到它的含义。

Souryuu and Ikari... that was like a gun and ammunition, or the right hand and the left. Wanting one meant wanting both. But Souryuu and Ikari and... someone else? Someone else who wasn't Rei? Someone else who wouldn't want anything to do with a funny-looking red-eyed girl half the world thought was a vampire? Never.  
苏琉与伊卡里……宛如枪与子弹，或右手与左手，缺一不可。然而，除了苏琉和伊卡里，还有其他人吗？不是零的另一个人？一个对世人眼中的红眼吸血鬼少女毫无兴趣的其他人？绝无可能。

She dabbed at her eyes with a sleeve. Her level of hydration was already sub-optimal. She wasn't going to walk away.  
她用衣袖轻拭泪水。她原本就缺水，但并没有离开的打算。

---

"Excuse me," someone said from behind him, the voice flat and angry. _I'm sorry,_ Shinji thought for a moment. Then anger rose up in him. Why should he be sorry? For enjoying a lovely day and his two beautiful friends? Why should Asuka and Meg be sorry?  
"抱歉，" 身后传来一个声音，平淡中带着怒气。真嗣瞬间感到歉意，但紧接着怒火涌上心头。他凭什么要道歉？就因为他享受着美好的一天和两位好友的陪伴吗？明日香和梅格又何须道歉？

He was just about to turn, to snarl something, when he felt Asuka stiffen in the curve of his arm. "Rei?" she said. "What...?"  
他刚要转身，正打算怒吼，却感觉到臂弯里的明日香身体一僵。“绫波？”她开口，“怎么……？”

"Never mind." He recognised the voice now. Of course it was Rei. He'd never heard her speak with so much emotion before. "I'll leave now." He twisted about. Her red eyes were like the last embers of a funeral pyre.  
"没关系。"他此刻辨出了那声音，是零。她以往从未如此动情地言语。"我这就离开。"他转身之际，她那双红眸宛若葬礼火堆将熄的残焰。

"Don't," Meg said. "别这样," 梅格说。

"Who are you?" 请问您是谁？

"Megaera. Of the Erinnyes. And who are you, daughter of Lillith and Adam and Eve?"  
梅格拉，复仇三女神之一。那么你又是谁，莉莉丝与亚当夏娃之女？

"They call me Ayanami." 他们称呼我为绫波。

"Ayanami Rei?" 是绫波丽吗？

"Yes." 是的。

"And these two are yours?"  
这两件也是你的吗？

"Yes." 是的。

"And did you ever tell them?"  
那么，你告诉他们了吗？

Rei blushed. "No." Her voice was very soft.  
玲脸颊泛红，轻声道：“不是的。”

"Shinji? Asuka?" 真嗣？明日香？

He looked at Asuka, and she at him. A flood of memories clicked into place; glances and words, scores of apparently disconnected incidents that suddenly became a whole. "Yes," they said as one.  
他凝视着明日香，而她也回望着他。记忆如潮水般涌来，眼神交汇、言语交流，众多原本零散的片段瞬间拼凑成完整的画面。“没错，”两人同时说道。

"So," Meg said, "would you like to come sit with us a while, Rei? That is... if you don't mind keeping company with someone as old and as ugly as me."  
梅格说：“那么，丽，要不要过来和我们坐坐？当然，如果你不嫌弃我这个又老又丑的人。”

"No," Rei said, "you're beautiful." She sat on the edge of the bench, reached out with one hand to Meg's face. "May I, Megaera?"  
不，" 蕾说，"你真的很美。" 她坐在长椅边上，伸手轻抚梅格的脸颊。"我可以吗，梅加拉？

"Of course you may. If you'll call me Meg."  
当然可以，叫我梅格就好。

"Meg." Rei traced the sabre slash that ran across Meg's cheek. Asuka drew in a sudden harsh breath. "Your scars are lovely, Meg."  
梅格。" 蕾伊轻抚着梅格脸颊上那道剑痕。明日香不由得倒吸一口凉气。"梅格，你的伤疤真美。

"One for each kill. And they aren't, though I thank you for the flattery."  
每击杀一次得一分。尽管我感谢你的夸奖，但实际上并非如此。

"They _are_ lovely. You're lovely."  
他们很可爱。你也很可爱。

Meg shook her head. "Dear gods. Do you know what I am? Any of you?"  
梅格摇头道：“天哪，众神在上。你们知道我是谁吗？这里有人知道吗？”

"Yes," Asuka said. "They say you're vengeance personified. But you're more than that, aren't you?"  
是的，" 明日香说道，"人们都说你是复仇的化身。然而，你远不止如此，不是吗？

"Maybe. Sometimes I think so. Then I meet the children of the men I've killed."  
可能吧。有时候我会这么想。但当我遇到那些被我杀害者的子女时，想法又变了。

She took a deep breath, and bowed her head. "Like the three of you. And now you know why I'm here today. I'm sorry."  
她深吸一口气，垂下头说：“正如你们三位所知。现在你们明白我今天为何而来。我很抱歉。”

"Thank you," Shinji said.  
"谢谢你，" 真嗣说道。

"I killed your father, Shinji. Whyever would you thank me?"  
我杀了你的父亲，真嗣。你有什么理由要感谢我呢？

"Because... Because if you hadn't, I would have had to, someday."  
因为...如果你没做，将来总有一天我得去做。

"Christos," Meg whispered. "That doesn't much help."  
克里斯托，"梅格轻声道，"这实在帮不上什么忙。

"No," Rei whispered, "but maybe this will." She hugged the Fury, and kissed her gently on the lips.  
"不，" 蕾低语道，"但这个或许可以。" 她紧紧拥抱了狂怒，并在她唇上温柔地吻了一下。

"And this." Shinji's lips brushed her ear, and his arms cradled her.  
"还有这个。" 渚薰轻吻她的耳畔，双臂温柔地环抱着她。

Asuka completed the triangle that surrounded her. "You're more than just a killer, Meg. And we're going to prove it to you, even if it takes all night."  
明日香完成了环绕自己的三角阵型。“梅格，你不只是个杀手。我们会让你明白这一点，哪怕要花上一整夜。”

---

"Thank you, sweet ones," Meg whispered, soft so as not to wake them. "Take care of each other." She kissed each brow, and tucked the blanket around their shoulders.  
"谢谢你们，亲爱的，"梅格轻声细语，生怕惊醒他们。"要彼此照顾。"她逐一亲吻他们的额头，并细心地将毯子掖好。

"Meg?" Rei opened her red eyes. "Will you come back?"  
梅格？" 雷伊睁开了她那双红色的眼睛。"你会回来吗？

"Not to this place." 不是这里。

"Will we see you again?"  
我们还能再见到你吗？

"Someday." 将来某一天。

"Are you sure?" 你确定吗？

"Even the great gods and goddesses don't know everything, Rei-chan. And I'm no more powerful than you. Just a little older. But sometimes the One above Them puts knowledge in our hearts.  
即使是伟大的神明也并非全知全能，Rei。我并不比你更有力量，只是年长一些。但有时，至高者会将知识悄然置于我们心间。

"I promise you that we will all meet again. And a Fury never breaks her promises. Not if it takes a thousand centuries to keep them."  
我向你保证，我们定会再次相聚。复仇女神绝不会违背诺言，即使要花上千年万载。

"We'll miss you." 我们会想你的。

"Shhh. Don't cry, Rei-chan."  
嘘，别哭了，小 Rei。

"Damn it, another night alone," Misato muttered as she fumbled with the key. She wasn't drunk, not really: just tired and unhappy. Another useless evening with useless people, slimy guys hitting on her, none of them half as cute as Shin- _Kaji_-kun. _My mind's playing tricks on me. I really need a glass of water, and then my bed. My cold bed, with nobody else in it... stop it._  
"该死，又是一个孤单的夜晚，" 三佐嘟囔着，摸索着钥匙。她并未真正醉倒，只是感到疲惫和沮丧。又一个毫无意义的夜晚，与那些无趣的人为伍，油腻的男人不断搭讪，却没有一个比得上真嗣——卡基君。我的思绪开始混乱了。我真该喝杯水，然后上床睡觉。那张冰冷的床，空无一人... 别再想了。

The apartment was dark. And someone was moving. "Asuka? Shinji?" She reached for the light switch. "What the hell?"  
公寓内昏暗无光，隐约有人影移动。“是明日香吗？还是真嗣？”她伸手摸索着电灯开关，心中疑惑：“这到底是怎么回事？”

The woman was tiny, barely more than a meter and a half. And lovely... not really beautiful in a conventional sense, but fresh and sweet-faced, her brown hair pulled back into a long braid. Misato had known a girl like that in school, a Scottish diplomat's daughter. Half the class had been in love with her.  
那位女士身材娇小，身高不过一米五多一点。她可爱动人...虽非传统美貌，却清新可人，棕色秀发编成长辫。葛城在学生时代就认识这样一个女孩，她是苏格兰外交官的女儿，班上不少同学都对她倾心。

"Major Katsuragi?" She was dressed in black, like a spy in an old movie, and she moved like... that special forces officer, at the conference three years ago. They'd shared a bottle of wine, the last night, and wound up in bed. Misato pushed the memory of strong arms and sweet schoolgirlish kisses aside, her hand reaching inside her jacket.  
"葛城少校？" 她一身黑衣，宛如老电影里的间谍，动作敏捷，让人想起三年前会议上那位特种部队军官。那最后一夜，他们共享了一瓶红酒，情不自禁地共度春宵。葛城将那强有力的拥抱和少女般甜蜜的吻的记忆暂时搁置，手探入夹克内侧。

_Feck, I left the gun in my desk. If she's harmed them, I'll kill her with my bare hands._ "Who are you, and why the hell are you in my flat?"  
糟糕，我把枪忘在桌子里了。要是她伤了他们，我定会亲手结果了她。“你究竟是谁，怎么会在我家？”

"Take good care of them, Major. They deserve it." She stood frozen as the stranger rose up on tiptoe to kiss her lightly on the lips. "Good night." And she was gone, fading away between one moment and the next.  
"少校，请好好照顾他们，他们理应得到这份关怀。"她愣在原地，只见那陌生人踮起脚尖，轻柔地吻了她的唇。"晚安。"话音刚落，她便如幻影般在瞬间消逝。

She hurried to the bedrooms. Asuka's was empty, the unmade bed occupied only by a stuffed monkey and a manga anthology. Her heart in her mouth, she slid Shinji's door open.  
她匆忙赶往卧室。明日香的房间空荡荡的，未整理的床上躺着一只毛绒猴和一本漫画集。她紧张得心都快跳出来了，小心翼翼地推开了真嗣的房门。

"How adorable..." she couldn't help but murmur. Rei was in the middle, her fellow pilots' arms clasped protectively around her. Their three heads shared one pillow.  
"真是太可爱了……" 她情不自禁地喃喃自语。丽位于中间，她的同伴飞行员们用双臂紧紧地护着她。三人的头共享一个枕头。

There was a fourth depression in the futon, behind Asuka's pale freckled back.  
在床垫上，明日香苍白带斑点的背部后面，还有一个第四个凹陷。

Obviously, it was time she was in bed.  
显然，是时候让她上床睡觉了。

Megaera dropped her clothes on the floor, ignoring them as they vanished. Carefully, she lifted the covers and slipped beneath.  
墨盖拉随手将衣物抛至地面，任其自行消隐。她轻手轻脚地揭开被褥，悄然滑入其中。

"Meg?" 梅格吗？

"I didn't mean to wake you, Tis," she whispered.  
"我不是有意吵醒你，Tis，"她轻声说道。

"'S all right. Come in the middle."  
没关系，到中间来吧。

"I don't want to rouse 'Lecta."  
我不想惊扰到'Lecta。

"She'll not mind." 她不会在意的。

"All right." Megaera climbed over her heart-sister's body and was embraced Still asleep, Alecta snuggled against her back.  
"好的。"墨盖拉越过心姐妹的身体，被拥抱着。熟睡中的阿勒克塔紧贴着她的背。

"So, sweetheart, how was it?"  
亲爱的，感觉怎么样？

"Not so bad, for once."  
这次还不算太糟。

"What happened? You usually hate killing."  
怎么了？你平时不是挺反感杀生的吗？

"Some younglings were very kind to me."  
有几个年轻人对我很友善。

"That's good." She yawned. "Love you, Meg."  
挺好的。"她打了个哈欠，"爱你，梅格。

"Love you, Tis." 爱你，Tis。

Megaera, Tisiphone, and Alecta are, obviously, the Kindly Ones. In other words, the Furies. These characterisations are mine, although elements of Meg's dress and appearance are similar to those of the nameless Fury in Alexander Jablokov's "The Fury at Colonus." Reading said excellent short story (found on his website) and David Weber's _Path of the Fury_ helped spark this fanfiction.  
显然，墨盖拉、提西福涅和阿勒克托就是复仇三女神，即人们常说的复仇女神。这些角色设定虽由我创作，但梅格的装扮和形象与亚历山大·贾布洛科夫的《科隆纳的愤怒》中那位无名的复仇女神颇为相似。正是阅读了这篇精彩的短篇小说（可在作者网站上找到）以及大卫·韦伯的《复仇女神之路》，我才萌生了创作这篇同人小说的念头。
