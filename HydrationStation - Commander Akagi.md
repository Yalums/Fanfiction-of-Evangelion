### Chapter 1 All it took was one sip

"It's time, darling." Kyoko whispers sweetly to little Asuka. Using the rays of light shining through the blinds of her window to see in the dimly lit room, she wraps a string along her delicate neck. "You understand, don't you? They're going to take me away from you." She strokes her soft, linen hair. No warmth emanated from holding her daughter, not like it used to be. But she knew that this is what a mother is supposed to do.  
“是时候了，亲爱的。”京子温柔地对小飞鸟低语。她借助透过百叶窗洒进昏暗房间的光线，将一根细绳绕在她纤细的脖颈上。“你明白的，对吧？他们要把我从你身边带走。”她轻抚着女儿柔软的亚麻色头发。抱着女儿，却感受不到往昔的温暖。但她知道，这是一个母亲该做的事。

"If they take you away from me, you'll have to stay with your father. You wouldn't like that, hm?" She ties the knot around her neck tightly. "And that… _bitch_, Henrietta. That won't do at all will it? Well, don't you worry, Henrietta. He'll get bored of you soon enough." Kyoko ties the practically weightless girl onto the lighting fixture. She admires her handiwork. "...Perfect." Asuka doesn't respond, her Mothers kindness is vindicated. She pecks her on the cheek. "I'll be joining you soon, Asuka."  
"如果他们把你从我身边带走，你就得和你父亲住。你不会喜欢的，嗯？" 她紧紧地在脖子上系了个结。"还有那个……婊子，亨丽埃塔。那可不行，对吧？别担心，亨丽埃塔。他很快就会对你厌倦的。" 京子把几乎没什么重量的女孩绑在灯具上。她欣赏着自己的杰作。"...完美。" 飞鸟没有回应，母亲的仁慈得到了证实。她亲吻了她的脸颊。"我很快就会来陪你的，飞鸟。"

A loud knock interrupts her peace. "Dr. Soryu? Are you in there?" The knocking intensifies into pounding. "Dr. Soryu!"  
一阵响亮的敲门声打断了她的宁静。"碇博士？您在里面吗？"敲门声加剧成了捶打。"碇博士！"

She growls, "You ratted me out, didn't you? You lying, two faced sack of shit. You're not going to lock me up. Not again." Kyoko steps on top of the stool and attaches the noose onto her neck. "My daughter needs me."  
她咆哮道，"是你出卖了我，对吧？你这个两面三刀的混蛋。你休想再把我关起来。绝不可能。" 京子站上凳子，将绳套套在脖子上。"我的女儿需要我。"

"Let me handle this." A familiar, feminine voice says behind the door. A gentle rap. "Kyoko? It's me, Naoko. I need to talk to you, please open the door."  
"让我来处理这件事。" 一个熟悉的女声在门外说道。轻轻的敲门声。"Kyoko？是我，Naoko。我需要和你谈谈，请开开门。"

"Go away!" Kyoko snarls. "走开！" Kyoko 咆哮道。

"Please be reasonable. I wouldn't want to have my men kick down your lovely mahogany door. Is it handmade?"  
"请理智些。我可不想让我的人踢破你这漂亮的桃花心木门。是手工制作的吗？"

Kyoko ignores her. Feeling resolve burning through her, she bites her cheek. "God is in his heaven…"  
Kyoko 无视了她。决心如火焰般在她心中燃烧，她咬紧了脸颊。“上帝在天堂……”

"Yamagishi. Kick it down."  
“山岸，踢开它。”

"All is right in the world…" She leaps off the stool right as the door comes flying open. Kyoko's neck doesn't break upon impact. She closes her eyes as she feels the rope caress her throat, slowly squeezing the air out of her throat as she welcomes the sweet death.  
“世界一切安好……”她从凳子上跃下，就在门被猛地撞开的那一刻。Kyoko 的脖子在撞击下并未折断。她闭上眼睛，感受到绳索轻抚她的喉咙，缓缓地挤压着她的气管，她欣然迎接那甜蜜的死亡。

Instead she thrashes frantically as the blinding light glares into her eyes. Two men lift her on either side while a silhouette of a woman waits in the door frame. "No! NO." She kicks at them, biting at her attackers arms as they throw her onto the bed and restrain her. "Let me die with her!" She lets out a guttural scream that shakes the entire mansion.  
相反，她疯狂地挣扎着，刺眼的光线直射入她的眼睛。两名男子分别从两侧将她抬起，而门口则站着一位女性的剪影。“不！不要！”她踢打着他们，咬住攻击者的手臂，当他们将她扔到床上并制住她时。“让我和她一起死！”她发出一声撕心裂肺的尖叫，震撼了整个庄园。

"Gag her." Naoko says. "We don't need another incident." A man with long greasy hair uses the rope to prevent her from biting her own tongue out as she kicks ferally. One of her high heels flies off and ricochets against the wall. Naoko approaches the bed and lowers herself to Kyoko's eye level. "Are you done with your little tantrum?" She hisses at her, attempting to throw a lob of spit at her in vain. "Lovely."  
“堵住她的嘴。”直子说道，“我们不需要再出什么乱子。”一个头发油腻的长发男子用绳子防止她咬伤自己的舌头，而她则狂野地踢打。她的一只高跟鞋飞了出去，弹在墙上。直子走近床边，蹲下身与京子平视。“你的小脾气闹够了吗？”她低声咆哮，试图朝她吐口水却未能成功。“真美妙。”

"Haallll haaaahin hillll eeeww!" Kyoko attempts to say through the gag.  
“哈啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！”京子试图通过堵嘴发出声音。

"Should I sedate her, Commander?" The long haired man asks.  
"我应该给她注射镇静剂吗，指挥官？" 长发男子问道。

"No. I need her to be lucid. That is, if there is anything left to communicate with. Is there Kyoko?" The woman in question glares at her, her eyes bloodshot. "Do you understand me? Blink once for yes, twice for no." She doesn't respond, Kyoko attempts to lunge at her.  
"不，我需要她保持清醒。也就是说，如果还有什么可以交流的话。有吗，Kyoko？" 被问到的女子瞪着她，双眼布满血丝。"你明白我的话吗？眨一次眼表示是，两次表示不是。" 她没有回应，Kyoko 试图扑向她。

Another man, an older one walks through the door frame. "Commander Akagi. I told you this was a waste of time."  
另一个男人，年纪较大的那位穿过门框。"赤木指挥官，我告诉过你这是在浪费时间。"

She lifts a finger at him. "Just a minute now, Kozo." Naoko keeps the fingers lifted, she shifts it left to right as Kyoko's eyes follow the finger. She points it to the doll hanging on the light fixture. "Is that your daughter, Asuka Langley Soryu?" She blinks instantly. Naoko smiles at Fuyutsuki and waves him dismissively.  
"她向他竖起一根手指。“稍等一下，Kozo。”直子保持手指竖立，左右移动，京子的目光随之移动。她指向挂在灯具上的玩偶。“那是你的女儿，惣流·明日香·兰格雷吗？”她立刻眨了眨眼。直子对冬月微笑，并随意地挥手让他离开。”

After a moment he walks out the door. "I don't imagine you remember him, useful, but forgettable. Always following that… _bitch_ Yui Ikari like she was God's gift to the world." Kyoko's breathing starts to slow down. "Yes, you can sympathize with that, can't you? I want to help you, Kyoko. A need has arisen and I would like for us to cooperate. Do you understand?" After a moment she blinks.  
"过了一会儿，他走出门外。“我想你不记得他了，有用，但容易忘记。总是跟在那……婊子碇唯后面，好像她是世界的恩赐。”京子的呼吸开始放缓。“是的，你能理解这一点，对吗？我想帮助你，京子。现在有了这个需求，我希望我们能合作。你明白吗？”过了一会儿，她眨了眨眼。”

"Good. Very good. I'll be candid with you, Kyoko, I owe you that much. We were never close friends. In fact, had a need not arisen just now you would've been hanging on your light fixture still, waiting for your… loved ones to discover you."  
"“好。非常好。我会坦诚对你，京子，这是我欠你的。我们从来不是亲密的朋友。事实上，如果不是现在有了这个需求，你还会挂在灯具上，等待你的……亲人们发现你。””

Kyoko stares blankly at her, evidently, Naoko is losing her attention. "I'll make this simple. Gendo Ikari has been deemed unfit to command Gehirn any longer. Drunk himself into a stupor and bit his own tounge off in a hissy fit. Hence-" She gestures to the rope. "-The gag. You understand. I personally believe that Gehirn has become obsolete and in need of reorganization. But that is beside the point. I have been appointed Commander in his place, and it just so happens that my prior position is now vacant. That's where you come in."  
"Kyoko 茫然地盯着她，显然，Naoko 的注意力正在涣散。“我会说得简单些。碇源堂已被认定不再适合指挥 Gehirn。他醉得不省人事，在一阵狂怒中咬断了自己的舌头。因此——”她指了指绳子。“——这就是口塞的由来。你明白的。我个人认为 Gehirn 已经过时，需要重组。但这不是重点。我已被任命接替他的指挥官职位，而我的原职位现在空缺。这就是你进来的地方。”

Kyoko blinks twice. "Oh? You're not interested? Perhaps I have something of interest for you then. Are you aware that your daughter, your real daughter, is still alive?" She frowns, genuinely confused and blinks twice, motioning to the doll. Her breathing begins to increase.  
"Kyoko 眨了两下眼。“哦？你不感兴趣吗？或许我有你感兴趣的东西。你知道你的亲生女儿，还活着吗？”她皱起眉头，真的感到困惑，眨了两下眼，指了指玩偶。她的呼吸开始加快。”

Naoko waves her hands to calm her down. "Shhh, shhh…. Sorry. That was inappropriate of me. I am… truly sorry for your loss. What if I could offer you something else?"  
"Naoko 挥手让她平静下来。“嘘，嘘……对不起。我刚才失礼了。我……真的为你的损失感到抱歉。如果我能提供其他东西给你呢？”

She leans in close to Kyoko's face. "What if I could help you see her again?" Kyoko blinks at her, she gestures to the hanging doll. "Not like that. I can take you to her, alive and well. Make you whole again. I'll take the two of you to a safe place. A place without pain, or danger. Away from that horrid husband of yours."  
她凑近了京子的脸。“如果我能帮你再次见到她呢？”京子眨了眨眼，她指了指悬挂的玩偶。“不是那样。我可以带你去见她，活生生且安然无恙。让你重新完整。我会带你们俩去一个安全的地方。一个没有痛苦，没有危险的地方。远离你那可恶的丈夫。”

The lines in Kyoko's face soften as her eyes dart back and forth. "Would you like that?"  
京子脸上的皱纹渐渐舒展开来，她的眼睛来回转动。“你喜欢那样吗？”

…

She blinks once. "If I take this gag off of you, will you cooperate?" Kyoko blinks once. Naoko nods to one of the men to remove the ropes.  
她眨了一下眼。“如果我取下你的口塞，你会合作吗？”京子眨了一下眼。直子向其中一名男子点头示意，让他解开绳索。

Kyoko gasps for air, she clutches the burn marks around her neck. She looks up to Naoko. "Where will you take me?"  
Kyoko 喘息着，她紧抓着脖子周围的烧伤痕迹。她抬头看向 Naoko。“你要带我去哪里？”

Naoko smiles. "To Japan. There is much work, tests to be done before you are ready to see Asuka again. I need you, Kyoko. I need your mind."  
Naoko 微笑着。“去日本。在你准备好再次见到 Asuka 之前，还有很多工作要做，很多测试要完成。我需要你，Kyoko。我需要你的头脑。”

She looks down, and then at the doll- no doubt imagining it as the lifeless body of her daughter. "And she will be safe?" Naoko nods. "Yes. Of course. Japan." Yamagishi lifts her body and leads her out of the room. "Japan…"  
她低头看去，然后看向那个玩偶——毫无疑问，她想象着那是她女儿的尸体。“她会安全吗？”Naoko 点头。“是的。当然。日本。”Yamagishi 扶起她的身体，带她走出房间。“日本……”

Naoko sits up from the bed and wipes the dust from her trousers. "Yes, I believe today shall be very productive. Don't you think, Kyoko."  
直子从床上坐起身，拍去裤子上的灰尘。“是的，我相信今天会非常高效。你不觉得吗，京子。”

She gazes aimlessly through the hallway, her head swaying weightlessly. "Yes. Much work to be done." The door on the other end of the hall burst open, a small figure sprinting through the door. "For Asuka."  
她茫然地凝视着走廊，头轻轻摇晃着。“是的。有很多工作要做。”走廊另一端的门突然打开，一个小身影冲了进来。“为了明日香。”

The little girl in the red dress lights up to see her mother on her feet. "Mama! Mama, they chose me! I'm an elite pilot now! I'm the best in the whole world!" She skids into a break, waiting for her mother to respond. Kyoko looks right past her as she walks by. "M-mama?" She waves frantically at her. "Mama! Why won't you look at me?"  
穿着红色连衣裙的小女孩看到母亲站起来，眼睛一亮。“妈妈！妈妈，他们选了我！我现在是精英驾驶员了！我是全世界最棒的！”她急刹车停下，等待母亲的回应。京子径直走过她，仿佛没看见。“妈——妈？”她疯狂地向她挥手。“妈妈！你为什么不看我？”

Fuyutsuki stops and kneels down as low as his knees will permit. "Child…"  
冬月停下脚步，尽可能地跪低至膝盖。“孩子……”

Naoko steps in between them. "Don't you worry, Kozo. I'll talk to her." She winks at him, "She needs a woman's touch right now." After a moment's hesitation, he nods and follows the men leading Kyoko away. Asuka attempts to follow but Naoko grabs her hand gently and turns her around. "Hello, honey. Do you remember me?" She shakes her head, "I wouldn't imagine so, you were only a baby-"  
直子走上前，站在他们之间。“别担心，耕助。我会和她谈谈。”她向他眨了眨眼，“她现在需要一个女人的关怀。”他犹豫片刻，点了点头，跟着带走京子的男人们离去。明日香试图跟上，但直子轻轻抓住她的手，将她转过身来。“你好，亲爱的。你还记得我吗？”她摇了摇头，“我想也是，你那时还只是个婴儿——”

"Where's Mama going?" “妈妈要去哪里？”

Naoko frowns, "Please don't interrupt me. Your Mother is very sick, you see. She needs help. There are very special doctors in Japan that can do just that-"  
直子皱起眉头，“请不要打断我。你知道吗，你妈妈病得很重，她需要帮助。日本有一些非常特别的医生，他们能做到这一点——”

"She can't go to Japan!" Asuka pouts. "Not without me."  
“她不能去日本！”明日香噘嘴道，“没有我她不能去。”

The Commander juts her jaw, she takes a deep breath and kneels down to her level. "Yes, I was getting to that. You will be accompanying her shortly. I must finalize the necessary paperwork with you father before that, until then you will be coming with me, as per his consent."  
指挥官紧抿着嘴，深吸一口气，蹲下身与她平视。“是的，我正要说这个。你很快就会陪她一起去。在此之前，我必须与你父亲完成必要的文书工作，在那之前，根据他的同意，你将和我一起。”

Asuka yanks her hand away from her. "Don't wanna go with you! You're scary."  
明日香猛地抽回手。“不想跟你走！你太可怕了。”

Naoko pinches the bridge of her nose. "You don't have a choice, honey." She hisses. "Your father has appointed me as your legal guardian, until your Mother is deemed fit to carry out said duty. Which, let's face it, will be very unlikely. Do not complain and I will find you a guardian more to your liking." She reaches for hand again. "Now I am very busy, saving the world and all. Until then, you're staying with me-"  
直子捏了捏鼻梁。“你没得选，宝贝。”她低声说道，“你父亲已经指定我为你的法定监护人，直到你母亲被认为适合履行这一职责。说白了，这几乎不可能。别抱怨，我会给你找个更合你意的监护人。”她再次伸手去拉。“现在我很忙，拯救世界什么的。在那之前，你就跟我住——”

"No!" She thrashes widely, scratching Naoko's face. "Oskar! Papa! Help-"  
“不！”她剧烈挣扎，抓伤了直子的脸。“奥斯卡！爸爸！救命——”

Asuka is interrupted by a backhand to the face. After a moment she clutches the red handprint on her face, her face starts to scrunch up. Before she can cry, Naoko pushes her to the wall, a vice grip around her arms.  
明日香被一记反手耳光打断。片刻后，她捂住脸上鲜红的掌印，表情开始扭曲。在她哭泣之前，直子将她推向墙壁，双臂紧紧钳制。

"You little bitch!" She shakes her violently. "Who do you think you are!?" Asuka freezes in place, hiccuping. "If I wanted to, I could leave you in a dumpster and no one would bat an eye. Not your precious butler. Your father? He's replacing you as we speak. Your _mama_?" She scoffs. "If it weren't for me, you would have found her spinning on a light fixture! Not that you know what that means. You should be grateful. Are you grateful?" Asuka shakes in her grip. "Are you!?"  
“你这个小婊子！”她猛烈地摇晃着她。“你以为你是谁！？”明日香僵在原地，抽泣着。“如果我想，我可以把你扔进垃圾桶，没人会多看一眼。不是你那宝贝管家。你父亲？他正在取代你。你妈妈？”她嗤之以鼻。“要不是我，你早就发现她在吊灯上旋转了！你懂什么意思吗。你应该感激。你感激吗？”明日香在她手中颤抖。“你感激吗！？”

Fuyutsuki walks back through the door, a scowl on his face. "What's going on here, Commander?"  
冬月走回门口，脸上带着怒容。“这里发生了什么，指挥官？”

Naoko turns to him and smiles, she sits up and straightens her trousers. "Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Asuka was just a little excited, which is to be expected. She's calmed down now." She turns to have. "Haven't you, Asuka?"  
直子转向他，微笑着，她坐起身，整理了一下裤子。“哦，没什么特别的。明日香只是有点兴奋，这很正常。她现在已经平静下来了。”她转向明日香，问道：“不是吗，明日香？”

Asuka looks at the sad old man, and then at the smiling Naoko. She suppresses a sniffle and nods.  
明日香看着那位悲伤的老人，又看了看微笑的直子。她忍住抽泣，点了点头。

Fuyutsuki remains unconvinced. "I heard shouting. A slap." He slowly moves towards the little girl and strains to squat down. He reaches for the red knuckle print on her face and she recoils.  
冬月仍然不相信。“我听到了争吵声。还有一记耳光。”他缓缓走向小女孩，费力地蹲下身。他伸手去摸她脸上的红色指印，而她却躲开了。

Naoko stares at him plainly, unintimidated. "If you have an issue, you can always take it up with our superiors."  
直子平淡地盯着他，毫不畏惧。“如果你有问题，随时可以向我们的上级反映。”

Fuyutsuki's shoulders slump. Asuka looks between the two and realizes just exactly who is in control of this situation. He looks at the girl, pleadingly. "Did she do this to you?"  
冬月肩膀一沉。明日香在两人之间来回看，意识到究竟是谁掌控了局面。他恳求地看着女孩。“是她对你做了这些吗？”

Asuka looks at Naoko, who smiles earnestly. She touches her face and shakes her head. "I slipped."  
明日香看向直子，后者真诚地微笑着。她摸了摸自己的脸，摇了摇头。“我滑倒了。”

The Commander chuckles softly, "So silly. I saw it happen myself."  
指挥官轻声笑道，“真傻。我亲眼看到的。”

Fuyutsuki feels his heart sink as he realizes this is a battle he can't win. "I see."  
冬月感到心沉了下去，他意识到这是一场无法取胜的战斗。“我明白了。”

Naoko claps her hands together. "Well then! I suppose we're all off to Japan now, aren't we?" She offers her hand to Asuka again.  
直子拍了拍手。“那么！我想我们现在都要去日本了，对吧？”她再次向明日香伸出手。

Asuka looks up and slowly reaches for it. "Yes. Japan." For Mama.  
明日香抬头，缓缓伸手去拿。“是的，日本。为了妈妈。”

"This is exciting!" Naoko exclaims. "I have a daughter too, you know. Pretty thing. I think you'll like her."  
“这真令人兴奋！”直子兴奋地说，“我也有个女儿，你知道的。很漂亮。我想你会喜欢她的。”

"Yes mam." “是的，女士。”

The old man walks ahead of them, his head hung low. He thought today would be a chance at salvaging a ruined situation. But now he sees that a dark path is being paved ahead of them. "Oh, Kozo. Would you be a dear and hold the door open?" Naoko calls out. He does so and watches the two pass him. "Why, thank you."  
"老人走在他们前面，头低垂着。他原以为今天会是挽救一个糟糕局面的机会。但现在他明白，一条黑暗的道路正在他们前方铺展开来。“哦，Kozo，你能帮忙开一下门吗？”Naoko 喊道。他照做了，看着两人从他身边经过。“谢谢你。””

As they sit in a limousine traveling to the airport. Naoko sighs wistfully. "I do wish Gendo was here. I miss… his mind."  
"当他们坐在前往机场的豪华轿车里时，Naoko 叹息着，带着一丝怀念。“我真希望 Gendo 在这里。我想念……他的头脑。””

Despite himself, Kozo Fuyutsuki couldn't agree more.  
尽管不愿意承认，Kozo Fuyutsuki 完全同意这一点。

_Not very well indeed. This is an idea I had on the Asushin Discord a few days back and just had to get it on paper. I'm not exactly married to it, but it is an interesting premise and might be cool to jump to when I'm feeling burnt out on PD. Which is a lot more fun and less horrific to write. Akagi might run a tighter ship, maybe be even more efficient- but at the end of the day, she's going to make Gendo Ikari look like a gentleman. Not much else to say about this other than it will be a very dark story, and hopefully everyone involved will get their justice by the end of it all.  
确实不太好。这是几天前在 Asushin Discord 上想到的一个点子，我忍不住要把它写下来。虽然我并不完全执着于这个想法，但它确实是一个有趣的设定，或许在我对 PD 感到疲惫时可以尝试一下。那会更有趣，写起来也没那么恐怖。赤木可能会管理得更严格，甚至更高效——但到了最后，她会让碇源堂看起来像个绅士。关于这个故事，没有太多可说的，它将会非常黑暗，希望到故事结束时，每个人都能得到他们应有的正义。_

### Chapter 2 Everything in it's Right Place

Nobody in this damn city knows what a turn signal is, it seems.  
这座该死的城市里，似乎没人知道转向灯是什么。

The drive was nice at first, the highway was practically empty for a monday, so she took her time to admire the view of the ocean.  
起初这段车程很惬意，周一的高速公路几乎空无一人，她便悠闲地欣赏着海景。

The flooded skyscrapers on its outskirts stood tall like mesas, or bent outwards, like a split rib cage, she noted morbidly on her way there.  
她前往那里的路上，注意到郊区的被淹没的摩天大楼高耸如台地，或是向外弯曲，宛如断裂的肋骨，她带着一丝病态地观察着。

There wasn't much time for contemplation during rush hour in Tokyo-03. Every block takes at least half a minute to pass, she resists the urge to bounce her foot on the gas pedal.  
在东京-03 的交通高峰期，没有太多时间沉思。每过一个街区至少需要半分钟，她强忍着踩油门的冲动。

All the kid had to do was wait by the train station. Now here she was looking for a fourteen year old boy, the only distinct information on the dossier is that he is brown haired, skinny and, as described by Ritsuko, looks like he's perpetually lost. Sounds like the type of person that easily disappears in the background.  
那孩子只需在火车站旁等待。如今她却在这里寻找一个十四岁的男孩，档案上唯一明确的特征是他棕色头发、瘦削，据律子描述，看起来总是迷路的样子。听起来就像是那种容易在人群中消失的人。

As she expects, none of this stands out at all to Misato as she juggles keeping an eye on the road and scanning for her assignment. That is until she receives a call from him saying that after waiting a while, he circled the block and found a payphone.  
正如她所料，这一切对美里来说毫无特别之处，她一边留意路况，一边搜寻目标。直到他打来电话，说等了一会儿后，他绕了一圈，找到了一个投币电话。

So she circles all the way back, waits through the stop lights, banging her head on the steering wheel, wishing that the streets could just be empty.  
于是她又绕了回去，在红绿灯前等待，头撞着方向盘，真希望街道能空无一人。

She stays on the line the whole time and finds him facing the inside of the telephone booth. "I'm in the Renault Alpine, do you see me?"  
她一直保持通话，发现他正面对着电话亭内部。“我在雷诺 Alpine 车里，你看到我了吗？”

"What's that?" He looks up.  
“那是什么？”他抬头问道。

Misato sighs. "It's a blue car. At your seven o'clock." The boy turns to his right. "Your other seven o'clock. I mean, on your left." He's off by a mile.  
美里叹了口气。“那是一辆蓝色轿车。在你七点钟方向。”男孩转向右边。“你另一边的七点钟方向。我是说，在你的左边。”他完全搞错了方向。

She groans and honks the horn three times, he finally locks eyes with her. "Is that you?" He asks. She responds by wordlessly opening the passenger door. After a moment's deliberation, he marches over, hesitating on each cross of the street.  
她呻吟着，连按了三次喇叭，他终于与她对上了视线。“是你吗？”他问道。她无声地打开了副驾驶的车门作为回应。经过片刻的犹豫，他大步走了过来，每穿过一条街道都显得迟疑。

When he gets to a closer eye sight, she pulls out the photo from her phone and levels it beside the boy's face, hoping she was mistaken.  
当他走近到能看清彼此的距离时，她从手机里翻出照片，将其与男孩的脸并排对比，希望自己认错了人。

But that was definitely Shinji Ikari. This was the candidate that the Marduk Institute hand picked?  
但那确实是碇真嗣。这就是马杜克研究所精心挑选的候选人？

He keeps himself distant from the car as far as he can without stepping back into traffic. Shinji pulls his own picture and levels it next to her, before looking down, his face red evidently from the contents of said photo. Misato leans into the passenger seat. "Need a ride?" He enters the car, flinching from the hot leather cooking under the sun. "Thanks for waiting."  
他尽可能地远离那辆车，同时又不至于退回到车流中。真嗣拿出自己的照片，与她的并排放置，然后低头看去，显然是因为照片内容而脸红。美里靠向副驾驶座。“需要搭个便车吗？”他坐进车里，因阳光下炙热的皮革而畏缩。“谢谢你等我。”

He rests his backpack on his lap. "Sorry. It didn't look like there was anywhere to park, so I tried to give you a heads up."  
他把背包放在膝上。“抱歉。看起来那里没有停车的地方，所以我试着提前告诉你。”

A pang of guilt hits her, "Don't worry about it." She offers a reassuring smile, but he's already looking back down. "Nice to finally meet you, Shinji." She offers her hand. "Misato Katsuragi."  
一阵内疚感袭来，“别担心。”她露出安慰的微笑，但他已经再次低头。“很高兴终于见到你，真嗣。”她伸出手。“美里·葛城。”

He offers a limp hand in return.  
他回以一只无力的手。

---
Misato can't say the same for Shinji, but she feels to be in quite a good mood. She finally had her car restored and detailed. Suddenly, thirty three more loan payments didn't feel that far away. Not to mention the drive over to the Geofront was leisurely, nothing to disturb them.  
美里对真嗣的心情不敢苟同，但她自己倒是心情颇佳。她的车终于修好并打理一新。突然间，那三十三笔贷款似乎也没那么遥不可及了。更别提驱车前往地下的路上悠闲自在，没有任何打扰。

She turns to him. "Are you hungry? When we're done with meeting the boss, we could get some burgers, if you'd like."  
她转向他。“你饿了吗？等我们见完老板，可以去买些汉堡，如果你愿意的话。”

Shinji fidgets but offers a nervous smile. "I've never had fast food before."  
真嗣有些局促不安，但还是露出了一个紧张的微笑。“我从没吃过快餐。”

She nearly turns the car around, but remembers that they're running late. "Never?"  
她差点掉头回去，但记起他们已经迟到了。“从没？”

"I don't really go out that often. Besides, my tutor teaches me recipes. I have to take care of my father, so I do most of the cooking. He's… not well."  
"我其实不怎么出门。而且，我的家庭教师会教我一些食谱。我得照顾我父亲，所以大部分时间都是我在做饭。他……身体不太好。"

"I see. Your father, that's Gendo Ikari, right? You know, I met him once, when I was about your age. I think he was colleagues with the Commander as well." She knows this already from his mostly blacked out dossier, but she feels a need to fill the silence, since there's no distractions.  
""我明白了。你父亲是碇源堂，对吧？你知道吗，我大约在你这个年纪时见过他一次。我想他和司令也是同事。"" 她从他几乎全被涂黑的档案中已经知道这些，但觉得需要填补沉默，因为没有其他事情分散注意力。

"I met her once when I was little, I think. Father didn't seem to like her that much. He, um, called her a… nevermind."  
"我小时候好像见过她一次。父亲似乎不太喜欢她。他，呃，称她为……算了。"

"Called her a what? Don't worry, I'm not gonna rat you out."  
“她说她是什么？别担心，我不会告发你的。”

He fidgets in the seat, eyes darting from side to side before leaning in to whisper to her. "...Old hag. I think. It's hard to tell what he's saying sometimes."  
他坐在椅子上不安地扭动，眼睛左右扫视，然后凑近她耳语道：“...老巫婆。我想是。有时候很难听清他在说什么。”

She fights back a snigger. On Misato's first day at NERV, she asked around for any interesting gossip casually and one of the bridge crew, Ibuki, she believes, mentioned word that the Commander and Gendo Ikari had some history.  
她强忍住笑意。在美里第一天到 NERV 时，她随意打听了一些有趣的八卦，据她所知，其中一位桥员伊吹摩耶提到了指挥官和源堂碇之间有些过往。

Other than running a very tight ship, having a sense of sterness and efficiency during work times, she was friendly and sociable after hours. "Really? But she's so nice." Perhaps rumors were just that. "Maybe she's mellowed out since then. But that Sub-Commander, though..." She shudders. "Total ice queen."  
除了在工作时间严格管理、展现出严肃和高效的态度外，她在下班后却友好且善于交际。“真的吗？但她人很好啊。”或许那些只是谣言罢了。“也许她从那时起就变得温和了。但那位副指挥官，虽然……”她打了个寒颤。“完全是个冰山女王。”

"Oh." Shinji looks down. "Is that why I'm being considered for a position at NERV? Because of my Father?"  
“哦。”真嗣低头说道。“我被考虑在 NERV 任职，是因为我父亲吗？”

Misato pouts, "I don't think so, candidates are hand picked and run by well over a hundred companies. So unless your father was friends with all of them, it seems like the job just might suit you."  
美里噘嘴道，“我不这么认为，候选人都是精心挑选并通过上百家公司审核的。所以除非你父亲跟他们所有人都是朋友，否则这份工作可能真的适合你。”

For the life of her, she had no idea why. He seems considerate, but perhaps not the sharpest blade in the drawer, she thinks without any malintent. He was certainly no Asuka. "Do you play any sports? You look like a football kind of guy."  
她怎么也想不通为什么。他看起来体贴，但或许不是最锋利的刀刃，她心想，并无恶意。他当然不是明日香那样的。“你平时玩什么运动吗？看起来像是会踢足球的那种人。”

He rubs his arm. "I play cello? And chess with Father sometimes too." So not picked for his athletic prowess either. And Misato strongly doubted that piloting EVA's had anything to do with instruments. Shinji turns to her, a glint of determination in his dull eyes. "Whatever the job is, I'll take it. So long as it can cover my fathers treatment."  
他揉了揉手臂。“我会拉大提琴？有时候也和父亲下棋。”看来也不是因为运动能力被选中的。而且美里强烈怀疑驾驶 EVA 和乐器有什么关系。真嗣转向她，原本呆滞的眼睛里闪过一丝决心。“不管是什么工作，我都会接受。只要能支付我父亲的医疗费用。”

"Well, NERV certainly takes care of their own." Misato says. Shinji nods and looks away, off to the view of the ocean. "You know, for such a spry young guy, you're quite the old soul."  
“嗯，NERV 确实会照顾自己人。”美里说。真嗣点点头，目光移向远处的海洋。“你知道吗，像你这样活泼的年轻人，却有着老灵魂的气质。”

"Thanks, you're pretty lively yourself." Shinji chuckles nervously, Misato squints at him and smiles. "Wait-"  
"谢谢，你也很活泼嘛。" 真嗣紧张地笑了笑，美里眯起眼睛对他微笑。"等等——"

She swerves wildly left and right as she enters the tunnel. "Whoah-woah! I can't control it, we're gonna crash!" Shinji grips the arm rest and hangs on for dear life. She evens out the car and laughs. Misato shifts back to the left lane. "I'm kidding!" Shinji relaxes. Suddenly, a motorcycle comes zooming towards them in the empty tunnel. "I know this car like the back of my hand."  
她进入隧道时左右狂飙。"哇哦——哇哦！我控制不住了，我们要撞车了！" 真嗣紧抓着扶手，拼命坚持。她稳住了车子，笑了起来。美里换回左车道。"我开玩笑的！" 真嗣松了口气。突然，一辆摩托车在空荡荡的隧道里向他们疾驰而来。"我对这辆车了如指掌。"

"Uhh, Ms. Misato?" "呃，美里小姐？"

"See?" Misato lets go of the steering wheel and turns to him, "Practically drives itself-"  
"看吧？" 美里松开方向盘，转向他，"几乎自己就能开——"

"Ms. Misato!" Shinji yelps and points to the approaching bike.  
"美里小姐！" 真嗣惊叫着指向迎面而来的自行车。

She swerves out of the way. Misato pokes her head out the window and looks back. "Jerk!" She shakes her head, "I swear, reckless drivers…"  
她猛地转向避开。美里探出窗外回头望去。"混蛋！" 她摇摇头，"我发誓，这些鲁莽的司机……"

They exit the car lift and wander around the derelict, metallic maze of the Geofront.  
他们走出汽车升降机，在废弃的、金属迷宫般的 Geofront 中徘徊。

"Hey Shinji, do you still have that orientation package?" Misato asks. He rummages through his backpack, pulling out the thick envelope and hands it to her.  
“嘿，真嗣，你还有那个迎新包吗？”美里问道。他翻找着背包，拿出厚厚的信封递给她。

Attached to his ID papers is a very long, finely hand written letter that smells of strong perfume. She flips through the dense, wordy health policies, NDA's, and evacuation procedures to finally find the maps. It was almost as though the package was designed to be glossed over.  
附在他的身份文件上的是一封很长、手写精细的信，散发着浓烈的香水味。她翻阅着密集的、文字繁多的健康政策、保密协议和疏散程序，终于找到了地图。这包装几乎像是设计成被人匆匆略过一样。

Shinji peers over her shoulder, "Don't you work here?"  
真嗣从她肩后探头问道：“你不在这里工作吗？”

"I'm new, okay!?" She spins around a few times, then points. "The elevators over there."  
“我是新来的，行了吧！？”她转了几圈，然后指向一边，“电梯在那边。”

---

"_Ritsuko, dear? Would you be so kind as to fetch our guests? It seems as though our new Captain is lost."_ A voice calls from the overhead PA.  
“律子，亲爱的？能麻烦你去接一下我们的客人吗？看来我们新上任的队长迷路了。”一个声音从头顶的广播中传来。

Underneath a pool of LCL, a woman in a scuba suit emerges. "Copy."  
在一池 LCL 液下，一名身着潜水服的女性浮现。“复制。”

After going through the decontamination process, she pulls off her diver cap to reveal a bob of mahogany brown hair. "Never change, Misato..." Ritsuko Akagi says to no one as she grabs a lab coat to cover herself.  
经过消毒程序后，她摘下潜水帽，露出一头深褐色的短发。“永远别变，美里……”赤木律子对着空无一人的空间说道，随即抓起一件实验室外套披在身上。

---

The digital clock in the elevator slowly drags to their desired floor, twenty eight.  
电梯内的数字时钟缓缓攀升至他们所要的楼层，二十八楼。

Misato eagerly awaits with anticipation, it was difficult for her to find topics to discuss with her companion that had nothing to do with the reason for him being here. At first she wondered why the Commander didn't simply include the actual job title he was being invited for in her letter. But as she talked to the anxious boy and attempted to pick his brain, she understood. He would panic instantly and refuse, but why delay the inevitable? Unless she has an ace under her sleeve, but even then, he couldn't be that valuable as a candidate, could he?  
美里满怀期待地等待着，对她来说，找到与同伴无关紧要的话题来讨论并不容易，这些话题与他来这里的原因无关。起初，她不明白指挥官为什么不在信中直接说明邀请他的具体职位。但随着她与这个紧张的男孩交谈并试图了解他的想法，她明白了。他会立刻恐慌并拒绝，但为什么要推迟不可避免的事情呢？除非她有王牌在手，但即便如此，他作为一个候选人也不可能那么有价值，不是吗？

The door slides open, Ritsuko waits on the other side. Underneath her lab coat, is a swimsuit and a pair of flip flops. Misato gulps at the sight of her intense poker face. "Ah... Ritsuko! Fancy seeing you here."  
门滑开了，律子在另一边等待。在她的实验服下，是一件泳衣和一双人字拖。美里看到她那严肃的扑克脸时，不禁咽了咽口水。“啊……律子！真没想到会在这里见到你。”

She steps backwards, motioning for them to follow. Shinji looks up from the orientation package and follows the two women. "It's been nearly two weeks, Misato. I'm surprised you don't at least memorize the route to your job."  
她后退一步，示意他们跟上。真嗣从介绍资料中抬起头，跟着两位女士。“已经快两周了，美里。我惊讶你至少还没记住去工作的路线。”

Her face turns red. "It's a work in progress." They step on an escalator that slowly leads them upward, the lighting is a dim purple.  
她的脸红了。“还在进行中。”他们踏上缓缓上升的自动扶梯，灯光是昏暗的紫色。

It's so cold, you can almost see your breath.  
天气真冷，你几乎能看到自己的呼吸。

Ritsuko shakes her head and sizes up the boy behind her. "So this is him." Shinji perks up.  
律子摇了摇头，打量着身后的男孩。“原来就是他。”真嗣精神一振。

Misato nods. "Yep. The one hand picked by the Marduk Institute." She taps Shinji's shoulder and points to their brown haired companion.  
美里点头。“是的，由马尔杜克机构精心挑选的那一位。”她轻拍真嗣的肩膀，指向他们那位棕色头发的同伴。

Strangely enough, her hair color doesn't suit her at all. "This is an old friend of mine. Ristuko Akagi. She's assistant to the Chief Scientist."  
说来奇怪，她的发色与她完全不相称。“这是我的老朋友，赤木律子。她是首席科学家的助手。”

Shinji reaches out and offers a limp hand. Ritsuko shakes it. "And assistant to the Sub-Commander as well, might I add." She says, taking a moment to scan his face. "He really does look like his father." He blushes and looks back down at the orientation package.  
真嗣伸出手，无力地递出。律子握了握他的手。“而且，我也是副司令的助手，可以这么说。”她一边说，一边仔细打量他的脸。“他真的长得很像他父亲。”他脸红了，低头看向手中的介绍资料。

"He looks like what I've seen in the pictures, yeah." Misato says with a chuckle. "And from what I heard, he has his old man's charm as well."  
"他看起来就像我在照片里看到的那样，没错。" 美里笑着说，"而且据我所闻，他还继承了他老爸的魅力。"

Ritsuko groans with exasperation. "Don't even get started, I hear that well enough."  
律子恼怒地叹了口气。"别提了，我听得够多了。"

"From who?" "从谁那里？"

The brunette shakes her head. "Nevermind." She turns to Shinji. "Are you enjoying the tour so far?" Alongside the escalator, lit by purple liquid it resides in, is a massive crimson hand.  
棕发女子摇了摇头。"别在意。"她转向真嗣，"你目前为止喜欢这次参观吗？" 在自动扶梯旁，被紫色液体照亮的地方，有一只巨大的红色手掌。

Shinji looks up, glancing casually at the hand. "Oh, it's been good, I just don't understand-" He does a double take at the hand and recoils, nearly falling backwards off the escalator. Misato catches him by the scruff of his shirt. "What the heck is that!?"  
真嗣抬头，随意地瞥了一眼那只手。“哦，还好，我只是不太明白——”他再次看向那只手，吓得往后一缩，差点从自动扶梯上摔下去。美里抓住他的衣领，稳住了他。“那到底是什么鬼东西！？”

Ritsuko looks up at the hand, unphased. She looks at Misato, "You haven't told him yet?" She shakes her head. Ritsuko turns to Shinji. "That, Shinji, is an Evangelion. Unit-02 to be specific. A biomechanical huma-"  
律子抬头看着那只手，面不改色。她转向美里，“你还没告诉他吗？”她摇了摇头。律子转向真嗣。“真嗣，那是 EVA，确切地说，是二号机。一种生物机械的人形——”

"It's a robot?" “那是机器人吗？”

She sighs, "Sure. It's a robot." Ritsuko takes in the sight, admiring her handiwork. She turns back to Shinji who is flipping through his orientation package for a reference. "You won't find any record of it. It's the ultimate man-made multipurpose combat weapon system."  
她叹了口气，“当然。这是个机器人。”律子欣赏着自己的杰作。她转回身，看到真嗣正在翻阅他的入职资料以寻找参考。“你找不到任何关于它的记录。这是终极的人造多功能战斗武器系统。”

Shinji's breathing begins to slow, "I see. And the job I'm a candidate for, the one I've been handpicked for, I mean. It's..." Ritsuko raises an eyebrow, evidently surprised at his intuition. "...to be an assistant of some sort, running errands?" The two women stare, "Or… one of the maintenance crew, right?" They glance at each other, not responding to the boy. "...R-right?"  
真嗣的呼吸开始放缓，“我明白了。而我被选中的那份工作，我是说，我被特别挑选的那份。它是……”律子扬起眉毛，显然对他的直觉感到惊讶。“……某种助理，跑腿的？”两位女士盯着他，“或者……维修团队的一员，对吧？”她们互相看了一眼，没有回应男孩。“……对吧？”

Misato runs her hand through her hair, remembering her specific orders to let the Commander break the news. Thankfully, she finds a distraction in the adjacent escalator. "Oh, Rits-" She points to the other escalator, which has two figures riding it. "It's your boss, that Chief Scientist."  
美里捋了捋头发，想起自己接到特别指示要让司令来宣布这个消息。幸运的是，她在旁边的自动扶梯上找到了一个转移注意力的对象。“哦，律子——”她指向另一个扶梯，上面有两个身影在乘坐。“那是你的上司，那位首席科学家。”

"And Sub-Commander." Ritsuko replies.  
"副司令。" 律子回答道。

Shinji peers at the Deputy in question. She wears a long black overcoat. Despite being a relatively short individual, the strawberry blonde cuts a rather imposing image just by her posture alone.  
真嗣打量着这位副指挥官。她身着一件长长的黑色大衣。尽管个子相对较矮，但这位草莓金发女郎仅凭站姿就给人一种威严感。

Beside her is a short figure, a girl in a green hoodie and what looks to be a red leotard for leggings. She pulls back her hood and stares at the giant crimson hand, revealing a mop of messy red hair.  
她旁边站着一个矮小的身影，一个穿着绿色连帽衫和红色紧身裤的女孩。她拉下帽子，盯着那只巨大的猩红手掌，露出一头凌乱的红发。

Eventually, the girl realizes she's being stared at, her eyes lead towards Shinji and the two lock on to each other for what feels like an eternity. Unable to scan the details of the other person's face, but staring nonetheless.  
最终，女孩意识到有人在盯着她，她的目光转向了真嗣，两人对视了仿佛永恒的一刻。尽管无法看清对方的面部细节，但依旧凝视着。

Misato giggles, "Looks like Shinji found some incentive."  
美里咯咯笑道：“看来真嗣找到了些动力。”

He blushes furiously and looks down, unbeknownst to him, the girl keeps staring.  
他满脸通红地低下头，却未察觉到，女孩依然在凝视着他。

Their paths diverge. 他们的道路分岔了。

---

NERV bridge crew run diagnostic reports, simulations for the coming battle, all based on her notes. The Commander watches from her surveillance cameras as her daughter and the new arrivals wander into the catwalk containing Unit 02.  
NERV 桥员们运行诊断报告，模拟即将到来的战斗，这一切都基于她的笔记。指挥官从她的监控摄像头中观察着她的女儿和新来者们走进了存放二号机的走道。

She turns to Fuyutsuki, "Kozo, would you be a dear and hold the fort? I must attend to our guests and our Sub-Commander is currently indisposed." He holds a stare at her and nods. Naoko smiles. "Good man."  
她转向冬月，“Kozo，你能帮忙守住这里吗？我必须去接待我们的客人和副指挥官，他目前不方便。”他凝视着她，点了点头。直子微笑道：“好样的。”

He watches her strut away to the elevator, a skip in her step. Fuyutsuki shakes his head. "Ikari, why didn't you stop your boy… Do you still believe in Yui's plan?"  
他看着她迈着轻快的步伐走向电梯。冬月摇了摇头。“碇，你为什么不阻止你的儿子……你还相信唯的计划吗？”

"Who's plan?" A voice calls out. Fuyutsuki's eyes widen and he slowly turns…  
“谁的计划？”一个声音响起。冬月的眼睛睁大了，他缓缓转身……

It's only Maya Ibuki. She blushes, "Sorry for eavesdropping, sir." She lifts her hands to reveal a steaming mug. "Your coffee?"  
原来是伊吹摩耶。她脸红了，“抱歉偷听了，长官。”她举起双手，露出一个冒着热气的杯子。“您的咖啡？”

Fuyutsuki blinks and takes the mug in his hands. It's painfully hot, but he squeezes it tightly to calm his nerves. "Right…" He chuckles, his breath ragged, "Forget an old man, Miss Ibuki, there's much work to be done."  
冬月眨了眨眼，接过杯子握在手中。它烫得让人难以忍受，但他紧紧握住以平复紧张的情绪。“对……”他轻笑一声，呼吸急促，“忘了我这个老头子吧，伊吹小姐，还有很多工作要做。”

She nods, "Aye-aye, sir."  
她点头，“遵命，长官。”

---

The lights switch on, and Shinji Ikari finds a giant head staring at him, face to face. "Woah!" He leans in closer to inspect it. "So this is from the hand I saw earlier…" He looks from side to side, the room is empty. "Where's the Commander?"  
灯光亮起，真嗣一抬头，发现一个巨大的头颅正与他面对面。“哇！”他凑近仔细观察。“这就是我之前看到的那只手……”他左右张望，房间里空无一人。“司令官在哪里？”

The static from a PA mic crackles, "_Sorry about that!"_ A high pitch feminine laugh echoes below the catwalk. Shinji looks up to see a silhouetted figure stand on top of the observation deck. It appears to be a woman, who is waving.  
扩音器中的静电声噼啪作响，“抱歉打扰了！”一阵高亢的女性笑声在走道下方回荡。真嗣抬头望去，只见观察台上站着一个剪影。那似乎是一位女士，正在挥手。

"_Did my letter say to meet at floor twenty eight? Silly me, I meant twenty nine!"_ Shinji and Misato glance at each other, both equally as confused.. Despite the surprise, the boy feels at ease from the friendliness radiating off the woman through the glass window. "_Please, meet me upstairs you two. Ritsuko, dear? I can take it from here. You remember the way to my office, don't you, Misato?"_  
“我的信上说的是在二十八楼见面吗？哎呀，我记错了，应该是二十九楼！”真嗣和美里面面相觑，同样困惑不解。尽管意外，少年却因透过玻璃窗感受到的那份友好而感到安心。“请你们俩上来吧。亲爱的律子，这里交给我处理就好。你还记得去我办公室的路吧，美里？”

Misato chuckles nervously and waves back to the Commander. "Yes, of course! we'll see you soon."  
美里尴尬地笑了笑，向司令挥手回应。“当然，我们很快见。”

The Commander lets out a soft giggle. "_Hope you're both hungry, once again, so sorry for the confusion!"_  
指挥官轻声笑了出来。“希望你们俩再次饿了，真是抱歉造成了混乱！”

Shinji leans in hesitantly, "It's okay!" He calls out before the mic feed cuts off.  
真嗣犹豫地凑近，“没关系！”他喊道，随后麦克风信号就中断了。

---

The long, narrow hallway leading to the office was lit with warm orange lights. As opposed to the standard, sterile hospital lights that decorate the NERV Headquarters.  
通往办公室的长长窄廊被温暖的橙色灯光照亮，与 NERV 总部装饰的标准、冰冷的医院灯光截然不同。

Regardless, the inside of the headquarters is so cold in some parts that you can see your breath, unlike its exterior. It's not wide enough to walk side by side; however, anyone passing through must walk in a single file line, with just enough room to shuffle past the other.  
尽管如此，总部内部某些地方冷得你都能看见自己的呼吸，与外部截然不同。空间狭窄到无法并肩行走；然而，任何人通过时都必须排成一列，仅够勉强侧身而过。

The door from the Commander's office swings open, a moody blue light pierces through the warm orange, but it's not Naoko Akagi who walks out.  
指挥官办公室的门猛地打开，忧郁的蓝光穿透温暖的橙色，但走出来的并非赤木直子。

Instead it was a young girl, but not the same one from earlier. She strides out of the office. Similarly, she is also wearing a hoodie, a black one. But underneath she has white leotard pants and no shoes.  
取而代之的是一个年轻女孩，但并非先前那位。她大步走出办公室。同样，她也穿着一件连帽衫，黑色的。但里面是白色紧身裤，且未穿鞋。

The almost blurred shape starts to become more defined as their paths cross. Shinji nearly thought she was bald, but in fact, she has blue hair. It was only pulled back tightly, in a small pony tail it seems.  
随着他们的路径交错，那几乎模糊的轮廓开始变得更加清晰。真嗣差点以为她是个光头，但实际上，她有着蓝色的头发。只是被紧紧地向后束起，似乎扎成了一个小马尾。

Misato waves at her. "Ah, you must be Rei Ayanami, right?  
美里向她挥手。“啊，你一定是绫波零，对吧？”

Rei stops walking, her dull crimson eyes gaze right past her. "Yes." She stays still, as though in a standoff.  
绫波停下脚步，她那暗淡的深红色眼睛径直穿过她。“是的。”她静止不动，仿佛在对峙中。

Shinji peers past Misato's shoulder, the strange girl doesn't seem to acknowledge his presence. Misato offers a smile, waiting for a response. After a beat she turns to present her charge. "This is Shinji, he's one of the candidates." She turns to him. "This is Rei Ayanami, she's also- ah." She minces her words. "She does the same job that you're applying for."  
"真嗣透过美里肩头望去，那陌生女孩似乎并未注意到他的存在。美里露出微笑，等待着回应。片刻后，她转身介绍她的同伴。“这是真嗣，他是候选人之一。”她转向他。“这是绫波零，她也——呃。”她斟酌着措辞。“她和你申请的是同一份工作。””

"Oh." Shinji briefly attempts to make eye contact with her, but her stagnant, bloodied stare is frightening at first. He lifts his eyes from the floor to see that she has not looked away from him yet, as if she was studying him. He lifts his arm and offers a loose handshake. Misato angles her body so he can reach. "Nice to meet you." He says politely.  
“哦。”真嗣试图与她对视，但她那停滞而带血的目光起初令人害怕。他抬起眼，发现她仍未移开视线，仿佛在研究他。他抬起手臂，伸出手去，试图进行一次松散的握手。美里侧身让出空间，以便他能接触到。“很高兴见到你。”他礼貌地说道。

Rei nods her head. "Yes." She looks at the hand and then back at him, then past his shoulder.  
绫波点点头。“是的。”她看了看他的手，然后又看向他，接着越过他的肩头望去。

She turns to Misato for answers. "Oh, he's trying to shake your hand."  
她转向美里寻求答案。“哦，他正试图和你握手。”

"Why?" Rei responds, Shinji's hand slowly lowers. "Is this common prepubescent courtship practices?" Shinji's hand flies to his side.  
“为什么？”绫波回应道，真嗣的手慢慢放下。“这是常见的青春期前求偶行为吗？”真嗣的手迅速缩回身旁。

Misato covers her face to suppress a laugh, noticing Shinji's beet red face. "No-no-no. It's just an ordinary greeting. It's a sign of goodwill."  
美里捂住脸试图抑制笑意，注意到真嗣涨红的脸。“不不不，这只是普通的问候。是一种友好的表示。”

Rei peers at the boy's hand. "Am I being ordered to shake the hand?"  
丽盯着男孩的手。“我这是被命令要握手吗？”

"I mean, it would be rude." She says, Rei stares blankly at her. Misato runs her hand through her hair. "Yep. Yes, that's an order."  
“我是说，那样会显得很失礼。”她解释道，丽面无表情地看着她。美里用手捋了捋头发。“没错。是的，这是命令。”

"Right away." Rei offers her hand, making Shinji follow suit. Their hands hover briefly before clasping. They continue shaking. "How long must the shaking commence for the goodwill to be established?"  
“立刻执行。”丽伸出手，示意真嗣也照做。他们的手短暂地悬停后握在一起。他们继续摇晃着。“要握多久才能确立友好关系呢？”

Before Shinji can respond, footsteps clicking from the office entrance catch the girl's attention. She stares at the distant figure briefly before turning away. Rei brushes past Shinji and Misato.  
在真嗣回应之前，办公室入口处传来的脚步声吸引了女孩的注意。她短暂地凝视着远处的身影，随即转过身去。绫波擦过真嗣和美里身边。

He doesn't take great notice towards the slight hesitation in her gait, rather that the end of her ponytail is rather short, not even reaching her neck.  
他并未过多留意她步伐中那一丝犹豫，反而是她的马尾辫末端相当短，甚至没有触及她的脖子。

It must have taken great effort to tie it all together.  
这一定是费了很大劲才扎起来的。

Commander Akagi waves to them from the other end of the hall. "Hi! I hope you don't mind. These days, there's so many random appointments that just have to be squeezed in, don't they?" She's wearing a black coat with golden trim, a emerald button on the top pinned to a tight olive turtleneck.  
赤城指挥官从大厅的另一端向他们挥手。“嗨！希望你们不介意。最近，有太多临时安排不得不挤进来，不是吗？”她穿着一件镶有金色装饰的黑色外套，顶端别着一颗翡翠纽扣，紧贴着橄榄色的高领衫。

Misato waves back, offering a friendly laugh, "Oh, no worries. I know the feeling." Naoko waits patiently as the two approach, her hands held together. "Good evening, Commander."  
美里挥手回应，友好地笑道：“哦，别担心。我懂这种感觉。”两人走近时，直子耐心地等待着，双手合十。“晚上好，指挥官。”

Naoko gently pats Misato's upper arm. "Misato, so nice to see you. I hope you two don't mind the cold, anything to get away from this dreaded heat, right?" She gestures to her office, leading her inside. Naoko stands in the frame of the door as Shinji meets her. "And this must be our candidate of the hour! Shinji Ikari, it's been so long. Naoko Akagi. Do you remember me?" She offers her hand.  
直子轻轻拍了拍美里的上臂。“美里，见到你真好。希望你们不介意寒冷，能逃离这讨厌的热浪，对吧？”她示意自己的办公室，领着他们进去。直子站在门口，迎接真嗣。“这位一定就是我们今晚的主角了！真嗣一，好久不见。我是赤城直子。还记得我吗？”她伸出手。

He loosely shakes back in kind. "I don't think so? Was I little back then?"  
他随意地回应着摇了摇头。“我不这么认为？我那时候很小吗？”

"Oh my, so little! We went for ice cream. You must have been this tall!" She points to her upper thigh and laughs, Shinji offers a bashful smile in response. "Well regardless, it's good to see you." Naoko gestures to the door and touches his elbow, to which he flinches "Oh!" She exclaims.  
“哦天哪，这么小！我们一起去吃冰淇淋。你那时候一定这么高！”她指着自己的大腿上方笑着说，真嗣有些害羞地笑了笑。“不管怎样，很高兴见到你。”直子示意门口并轻触他的手肘，他不由得一缩，“哦！”她惊呼道。

"Sorry-" Shinji chuckles nervously.  
“抱歉——”真嗣紧张地笑了笑。

"Oh, no-no, don't be sorry! Please, come in!" She says, not moving. Shinji shuffles through the shared door frame. "I do hope she wasn't bothering you." Naoko says, staring at the far end of the hall.  
"哦，不不，别道歉！请进！" 她站在原地没动。真嗣拖着脚步穿过共用的门框。"我希望她没打扰到你。" 直子说道，目光投向走廊的尽头。

"Rei? No, not at all. I was just introducing her to Shinji." Misato laughs, recalling their memory. "He tried to shake her hand but she got confused."  
"丽？没有，一点也没有。我只是带她认识一下真嗣。" 美里笑着回忆起那段记忆。"他试图和她握手，但她有些困惑。"

"Yes, she still has much to learn." Naoko leads them into her vast office, "Tell me, how was your trip over here?" She looks at Shinji.  
"是的，她还有很多要学的。" 直子领着他们走进她宽敞的办公室，"告诉我，你们来这里的旅途怎么样？" 她看着真嗣问道。

"It was good, the Geofront is, well, it's amazing!" He turns and gestures to one large, slanted window on the nearest wall, giving a full display of the underground cities and garden climate. Judging by the angle of the windows and the scope of the office, Shinji assumed they were at the peak of the pyramid. The Commander's desk rests far against the wall, the ceiling etched with letterings he didn't understand.  
"地下都市真是太棒了，真是令人惊叹！" 他转身指向最近墙壁上的一扇大斜窗，透过窗户可以一览无余地看到地下城市和花园气候。从窗户的角度和办公室的规模来看，真嗣猜测他们位于金字塔的顶端。司令的办公桌远远地靠在墙边，天花板上刻着他看不懂的文字。

He looks down at the floor in awe. "It's like nothing I've ever seen before." It was a see through glass to where you could observe the entire Geofront.  
他惊叹地低头看着地板。"这是我从未见过的景象。" 地板是透明的玻璃，可以观察到整个地下都市。

"There certainly are perks to this job." Naoko says with an earnest smile, looking at the letters. She sighs, "A little tacky in my opinion, but a renovation is low on my list, I'm afraid." She stops by a modest dining table in the centre of the wide space. It's blanketed by a silk tablecloth, three plates are wrapped by tin foil. "Who's hungry?" She pulls away the tin foil on Misato's plate.  
"这份工作确实有它的好处。" 直子真诚地笑着说，目光落在那些文字上。她叹了口气，"在我看来有点俗气，但恐怕翻新不在我的优先列表上。" 她停在宽敞空间中央的一张朴素餐桌旁。桌上铺着丝绸桌布，三个盘子被锡纸包裹着。"谁饿了？" 她揭开了美里盘子上的锡纸。

The hot air escaping from the seal travels to Misato's nose as it sniffs, she blinks. "Is that… steak?" Her stomach gurgles.  
从密封处逸出的热气飘到美里鼻子前，她嗅了嗅，眨了眨眼。“那是……牛排吗？”她的肚子咕噜作响。

Naoko nods, "Medium rare."  
直子点头，“五分熟。”

"As God intended." Misato says, Naoko covers her mouth and giggles softly in response.  
“如上帝所愿。”美里说道，直子捂住嘴，轻声笑了起来。

She takes a seat. "Well, don't just stand there!"  
她坐了下来。“哎，别光站着呀！”

"Don't mind if I do, boss." She motions for Shinji to follow her to the table. " Thank you for the food!" Naoko sits across from him, with Misato on the side.  
“当然不介意，老板。”她示意真嗣跟着她到桌边。“谢谢你的款待！”直子坐在他对面，美里则坐在旁边。

Shinji mimics Misato's bow. Naoko neatly folds the foil on her plate into a small square and sets it aside. "I'd offer you beer as well, but you're driving after this, right?" Misato nearly coughs out a sliced cube of steak. "Don't worry, Misato, I'm only teasing!"  
真嗣模仿着美里的鞠躬。直子利落地将铝箔纸折成一个小方块，放在一旁。“我也想请你喝啤酒，但你待会儿还要开车，对吧？”美里差点把一块切好的牛排咳出来。“别担心，美里，我只是在开玩笑！”

Misato thumps her chest. "I swear, I keep it outside of work."  
美里捶了捶胸口。“我发誓，我工作时从不喝酒。”

"Oh, dear, I wasn't implying. I wouldn't have hired you otherwise." She smiles. "Besides, I personally believe that one must take time off to enjoy themselves after a hard day's work. And make time for the people that matter." Naoko clears her throat. "A concept my predecessors didn't necessarily subscribe to, but anyways," She turns to the boy. "How do you like it, Shinji?"  
“哦，亲爱的，我不是那个意思。否则我也不会雇用你了。”她微笑着说，“再说了，我个人认为，一个人在辛苦工作后必须抽时间享受生活，也要为那些重要的人腾出时间。”直子清了清嗓子，“虽然我的前任们未必认同这一点，但无论如何，”她转向男孩，“你喜欢吗，真嗣？”

He takes his time to chew the meal, "I really like the seasoning, did you make it yourself?"  
他慢慢咀嚼着食物，“我真的很喜欢这个调味，是你自己做的吗？”

She nods, Misato looks surprised. Naoko turns to her, "You didn't think those amateurs in the cafeteria made this, did you? Maybe I'll teach you the recipe someday."  
她点点头，美里看起来很惊讶。直子转向她，“你不会以为食堂里那些业余人士能做出这个吧？也许哪天我会教你这个食谱。”

"I'd like that. But-" Shinji looks down at his meal, suddenly solem. He pokes at the steak. "Normally I can only cook softer foods."  
“我很期待。但是——”真嗣低头看着他的餐盘，突然变得严肃。他戳了戳牛排。“通常我只能做些更软的食物。”

"I see." Naoko nods, "Speaking of, how is your father these days?"  
“我明白了。”直子点头道，“说到这个，你父亲最近怎么样？”

"He's doing well. I've been trying to convince him to learn sign language but- well. He's been…"  
"他现在挺好的。我一直试图说服他学手语，但是——嗯，他一直……"

She leans in, "Stubborn?"  
她凑近了些，"固执吗？"

He hesitates, glancing between the two women. "Yeah... B-but he's in good health. Our doctor recently used tissue from his thigh to help make him a new tongue, so now he can eat on his own."  
他犹豫了一下，目光在两位女士之间游移。"是的……不过他身体状况良好。我们的医生最近用他大腿上的组织帮他做了一个新舌头，所以他现在可以自己吃东西了。"

Naoko covers her mouth. "Oh, poor thing." She turns to Misato, who is shovelling food, half paying attention. "His tongue got bitten off during a seizure and this young man has been looking after his father all by himself."  
直子捂住嘴。“哦，真可怜。”她转向美里，后者正忙着往嘴里塞食物，只分了一半心思。“他父亲在癫痫发作时咬掉了舌头，而这个年轻人一直独自照顾他。”

Misato stops chewing and slowly turns to the quiet boy, unable to muster words of sympathy.  
美里停止了咀嚼，缓缓转向那个安静的男孩，却说不出一句安慰的话。

Shinji offers a small smile. "We have a nurse who helps with Father-"  
真嗣露出一个淡淡的微笑。“我们有个护士帮忙照顾父亲——”

Naoko waves her hand in dismissal, "Of course, I wouldn't want to discredit her. Or is it a he?"  
直子摆手表示不在意，“当然，我不想贬低她。还是说他？”

"N-no it's a woman. Ms. Hanako."  
“不，是位女士。花子小姐。”

"Oh. I see." She saws off a hefty slice of the steak. "Regardless, I find this to be an admirable trait, Shinji. You're devoted. Frankly, it's one of the reasons I think you would make for an excellent candidate."  
“哦，我明白了。”她切下一大块牛排，“无论如何，我觉得这是种值得赞赏的品质，真嗣。你很忠诚。坦白说，这也是我认为你会是一个优秀候选人的原因之一。”

Shinji looks down, "Is that the only reason I'm being considered?"  
真嗣低头问道，“这就是我被考虑的唯一原因吗？”

She shakes her head, "No, of course not. I personally believe you are very brave." He looks up to her. "Traveling alone to a city you don't know about, for a job interview you don't even know the position for? If that's not brave, I don't know what is."  
她摇了摇头，“不，当然不是。我个人认为你非常勇敢。”他抬头看向她，“独自一人前往一个陌生的城市，参加一个连职位都不清楚的面试？如果这都不算勇敢，那我不知道什么才算了。”

He blushes, "I-I heard that NERV employees and their families have very good benefits."  
他脸红了，“我、我听说 NERV 的员工及其家属福利非常好。”

"My point exactly." "我正是这个意思。"

"But this job, no one's told me about it. What would I be doing exactly?"  
"但这份工作，没人跟我详细说过。我具体要做什么呢？"

"Come now. You're a smart young man." She leans in, "What sort of job do you think you're here for?"  
"别这样，你是个聪明的年轻人。"" 她凑近了些，""你觉得你来这里是做什么工作的？"

Misato continues eating, observing the conversation unfold.  
美里继续吃着，观察着对话的展开。

He hesitates, "An intern? Ah, assistant? I-I can cook and clean too, if that's what..." Naoko smiles at Shinji endearingly.  
他犹豫了一下，"实习生？啊，助理？我...我还会做饭和打扫，如果这是..." 直子亲切地对真嗣微笑。

"...You want me to pilot that robot. Unit 02." He responds, afraid of either answer.  
"...你想让我驾驶那个机器人。二号机。" 他回答道，对任何答案都感到害怕。

"Oh, no." She responds. Shinji's shoulders slump. " That one is already occupied, I'm afraid. The vacant EVA we had in mind for you was Unit-01." She suppresses a laugh with her hand, as if remembering an old joke. "The old thing's been collecting dust for ages. But for you, I'm sure we could have it operational in no time at all."  
"哦，不。" 她回应道。真嗣的肩膀垂了下来。"恐怕那个已经被占用了。我们原本打算给你的是 01 号机。" 她用手掩住嘴，仿佛记起了一个老笑话。"那老东西已经积灰很久了。但对你来说，我相信我们很快就能让它重新运转起来。"

Shinji looks at Misato who regards him evenly, he looks back to the Commander. "...You're serious."  
真嗣看着美里，她平静地回视着他，他又转向司令。"...你是认真的。"

"Yes, why wouldn't I be? It's like I told you. I believe you potentially have a very promising career here with us at NERV."  
"当然，我为什么不认真呢？就像我告诉你的那样。我相信你在这里与我们一起在 NERV 有着非常光明的前途。"

"I… I don't know what to say."  
"我……我不知道该说什么。"

She rests her hand under her chin. "Yes?" Shinji stammers and she softly chuckles. "I'm only teasing. How about instead, you hear me out. I'll describe the job description, responsibilities. The wage, benefits. And afterwards, you can tell me what you think. Sounds good?" Naoko looks down and plays with her food.  
她将手托在下巴上。“是吗？”真嗣结巴着，她轻声笑了起来。“我只是开个玩笑。不如这样，你先听我说。我会描述一下工作内容、职责、薪资和福利。然后，你可以告诉我你的想法。这样好吗？”直子低头摆弄着食物。

He hesitates, looking at Misato, who nods in approval. After a moment, he follows suit.  
他犹豫了一下，看向美里，美里点头表示同意。过了一会儿，他也跟着点了点头。

Naoko clears her throat. "Well, as you can imagine, we did not create seventy metre war machines for show. Humanity is under attack by extra-terrestrial beings called Angels. All we know is that their goal is to wipe us all out. And in particular this Geofront we are sitting in, right now."  
直子清了清嗓子。“嗯，如你所想，我们制造七十米高的战争机器并非为了展示。人类正受到名为使徒的外星生物的攻击。我们所知的是，他们的目标是彻底消灭我们。尤其是我们现在所在的这个 Geofront。”

Shinji leans to look down at the window, visibly stressed. Naoko shakes her head. "Oh dear, not right now. We're able to predict when the Angels will be arriving. You really didn't think I would bring you here right before the attack and pin you with an ultimatum? That would just be unprofessional-"  
真嗣侧身望向窗外，明显感到压力。直子摇了摇头。“哦，亲爱的，不是现在。我们能够预测使徒的到来时间。你真的以为我会选择在袭击前带你来这里，给你下最后通牒吗？那未免太不专业了——”

"O-oh. Well, I appreciate that-"  
“哦——哦。嗯，我很感激——”

"Please, let me finish." Naoko responds, Shinji refrains from an apology. "As I was saying, you'd be well prepared, trained and conditioned for such fights against the Angels well in advance. Our estimates for their arrivals are general within a three day range, so you would be on twenty four hour standby. You would be working with two other pilots that you will shadow until you feel that you're confident enough to handle sorties on your own. This goes without saying, there always is the risk of injury, or heaven forbid, death. But we have precautions to prevent that. And you would be very well compensated. A pilot's earrings are roughly six hundred fifty-nine thousand, five hundred sixty-five yen. Bi-weekly. "  
“请让我说完。”直子回应道，真嗣忍住了道歉。“正如我所说，你将会得到充分的准备，接受训练和调整，以便提前应对与使徒的战斗。我们对他们到来的估计大致在三天范围内，所以你将处于二十四小时待命状态。你将与另外两名飞行员一起工作，直到你觉得自己有足够的信心独立执行任务。这不用说，总是存在受伤的风险，甚至更糟糕的是，死亡。但我们有预防措施来防止这种情况。而且你将得到非常优厚的报酬。一名飞行员的耳环大约是六十五万九千五百六十五日元。每两周。”

She smiles, "After gross deductions, of course.  
她微笑着说：“当然，扣除各种费用后。”

Misato slowly gulps down her food and leans to Shinji, "That's double what I make…" She says wistfully.  
美里慢慢地咽下食物，向真嗣倾身说道：“那是我工资的两倍……”她向往地说。

Naoko looks at Misato, who is miles away, simply enjoying her first decent meal in weeks. "Obviously it would be kept in a trust fund for emergency reasons- Oh, and let's not forget benefits, NERV employees receive top of the line health care, dental, physiotherapy, specialty treatment. It's all there on the orientation package." She gestures to the laminated folders.  
直子看着美里，她正沉浸在数周以来第一顿像样的餐食中，仿佛远在天边。“显然，这笔钱会存入一个信托基金，以备不时之需——哦，还有，别忘了福利，NERV 员工的医疗保健、牙科、物理治疗、专科治疗都是顶级的。这些都在入职手册里写得清清楚楚。”她指了指那些塑封文件夹。

Naoko clears her throat. "And regarding living arrangements…" Misato perks up when she realizes the Commander's eyes are on her. "Since we can't have you coming into school and work everyday from Matsudo, I was thinking he could stay with you, Misato. Considering your prior experience. Would you mind? If you don't think it would interfere with your duties, I mean."  
直子清了清嗓子。“至于住宿安排……”美里注意到司令的目光转向她，顿时来了精神。“既然你不能每天从松户往返学校和工作，我想他可以和你住在一起，美里。考虑到你之前的经验。你介意吗？我是说，如果你觉得这不会影响你的职责的话。”

Not able to get a full bite into her steak yet without being interrupted, Misato considers with her mouth half full and nods. "Not at all. Does this mean… that maybe Asuka could come back and live with me as well?"  
还没来得及好好咬一口牛排就被打断，美里嘴里半含着食物，思索了一下，点点头。“一点也不介意。这是否意味着……也许明日香也可以回来和我一起住？”

Naoko looks up from her meal, still cutting at the steak. She sets down the utensils and intertwines her fingers. "I don't know how I feel about that. Teenagers their age shouldn't be sharing spaces together."  
直子从餐盘中抬起头，依旧在切割着牛排。她放下餐具，手指交缠。“我不确定这样对不对。他们这个年纪的孩子不应该共用空间。”

Misato laughs in disbelief, she shakes her head. "You don't think that Shinji would-"  
美里难以置信地笑出声，摇了摇头。“你不觉得真嗣会——”

"We can discuss this later. Look at us," Naoko waves her hand and looks at Shinji, "Here we are talking about your future when you haven't even made a decision yet."  
“我们可以晚点再谈这个。看看我们，”直子挥了挥手，看向真嗣，“我们在这里讨论你的未来，而你甚至还没做出决定。”

"N-no, it's fine. It's just a lot to take in, that's all."  
"不，没事。只是信息量有点大，仅此而已。"

"You wouldn't have to say yes right away. How about I give you a few days to think about it? Fully read the orientation package, and then call me with your decision."  
"你不必立刻答应。不如我给你几天时间考虑？仔细阅读一下介绍资料，然后打电话告诉我你的决定。"

Misato nods in approval. "That seems fair."  
美里点头表示同意。“这样很公平。”

The two women look at Shinji expectantly. He prods at the food and takes a deep breath. "I appreciate the offer, Commander Akagi. I really do. But I think there must have been a mistake. I really don't feel like I'm qualified for this. A-and I need to look after my Father."  
两位女士期待地看着真嗣。他拨弄着食物，深吸了一口气。“我很感激您的提议，赤木指挥官。真的。但我想一定是哪里弄错了。我真的不觉得自己适合这份工作。而且我需要照顾我的父亲。”

"Like I said, you would be well trained before you saw any action. And there's precautions in place. And of course, your father would receive all the benefits that you do. He would be transferred to our facility and receive the utmost set of treatment."  
“就像我说的，你会在实战前接受充分的训练。而且我们有预防措施。当然，你的父亲也会享受到你所有的福利。他会转移到我们的设施，接受最高级别的治疗。”

"-I don't know if he'd- The thing is, I came here expecting a… quieter sort of job. I might panic and hurt somebody." He continues, Misato stares, her brow knitted into a frown. "If there's any other sort of job. Any job, I'm more than willing to do what it takes. I can even clean too. I-" Naoko's stare is neutral, her expression unreadable. He bows his head. "-I'm truly sorry for wasting your time."  
“我不知道他会不会……问题是，我来这里原本是期待一份……更安静的工作。我可能会惊慌失措，伤害到别人。”他继续说道，美里皱着眉头盯着他。“如果有其他任何工作。任何工作，我都非常愿意尽我所能。我甚至可以打扫。我——”直子面无表情，眼神中没有透露任何情绪。他低下头。“——真的很抱歉浪费了您的时间。”

She takes a slow deliberate chew of her meal. Misato shakes her head. Shinji shamefully avoids her gaze, his chest tight.  
她慢慢地、有意识地咀嚼着食物。美里摇了摇头。真嗣羞愧地避开她的目光，胸口发紧。

Naoko shrugs. "That's okay."  
直子耸了耸肩。"没关系。"

"I-It is?" "我——真的可以吗？"

"Yes, of course! Why wouldn't it be? I asked you to come here for a job offer, not to conscript you. I wouldn't want to do anything that would make you uncomfortable."  
"当然可以！为什么会不行呢？我邀请你来这里是提供工作机会，不是征召你。我可不想做任何让你不舒服的事情。"

"...It's really okay? The other pilots won't need my help?"  
"...真的可以吗？其他飞行员不需要我的帮助吗？"

Naoko waves her hand dismissively. "Ah, my girls will manage. I'll let you sit on this for a little while before I start going over the next candidates, okay? Misato, could you drive him home after we're done eating, please?"  
直子不以为意地挥了挥手。“啊，我的姑娘们能应付得来。我会让你先考虑一下，然后再开始考察下一位候选人，好吗？美里，我们吃完饭后你能开车送他回家吗？”

Misato nods, not looking up from her plate. "Yes, Commander."  
美里点头，目光未曾离开她的盘子。“是的，指挥官。”

Shinji fidgets in his seat. "I not really sure if my answer will be the same, you have the w-wrong-"  
真嗣在座位上局促不安。“我不太确定我的答案是否相同，你可能找错人了——”

She rests her hand on top of Shinji's, snapping him out of his anxiety. "Shinji. All I'm asking you to do is take the time to think it through, weigh out your options. Give it a day or two and I'll accept any answer you give me."  
她将手放在真嗣的手上，让他从焦虑中回过神来。“真嗣。我只想让你花时间仔细考虑，权衡你的选择。给我一天或两天的时间，我会接受你给我的任何答案。”

The knot in his stomach loosens, replaced by an uncontrollable flutter in his chest. "Okay. I'll think about it. Thank you for the opportunity, Commander."  
他胃里的结松开了，取而代之的是胸中无法抑制的悸动。“好的，我会考虑的。感谢您给我这个机会，指挥官。”

She smiles, her hand still on his. "Please, call me Naoko."  
她微笑着，手依然搭在他的手上。“请叫我直子。”

---

Misato's mood during the ride back to the train station is a starkly different one from the drive earlier in the morning. Her eyes scan the road, the grip on the steering wheel tight. She hasn't spoken a word to Shinji since they entered the car.  
在返回火车站的路上，美里心情与今早开车时截然不同。她的目光扫视着路面，紧握方向盘的手指显得格外用力。自从他们上车以来，她一句话也没有对真嗣说过。

He fidgets uncomfortably, the orientation package resting on his lap, backpack at his feet. "She seemed nice."  
他不安地扭动着，宣传册放在膝上，背包在脚边。“她看起来挺友好的。”

"Mhmm. Really courteous of her to allow you to take time to think about the offer too." Her voice is considerably lower than the more energetic pitch from earlier as well. "You don't normally get that in the real world."  
“嗯哼。她真是太客气了，还让你有时间考虑这个提议。”她的声音比之前更有活力的语调低了许多。“在现实世界里，你通常得不到这种待遇。”

"I'm not going to-" Shinji stops himself, waiting for a reaction. Her eyes remain focused on the road. "The Geofront was incredible, I can't believe you work there-"  
“我不会——”真嗣顿了顿，等待她的反应。她的目光依旧紧盯着前方道路。“地底都市真是不可思议，真不敢相信你在那里工作——”

"Why didn't you take the job?"  
“你为什么不接受那份工作？”

"Sorry?" He says. Misato doesn't respond. She raps her thumbs impatiently on the steering wheel. "B-because I'm not qualified." She sighs slowly. "...Are you mad?" He asks cautiously.  
“抱歉？”他说。美里没有回应。她不耐烦地用拇指敲打着方向盘。“因为我不合格。”她慢慢叹了口气。“……你生气了吗？”他小心翼翼地问。

"I'm not mad. Just… disappointed." Misato grimaces, "_God, I sound like my father."_  
“我没生气。只是……失望。”美里皱了皱眉，“天啊，我听起来像我爸一样。”

She shakes her head. "Do you know how many people would literally kill to have that kind of offer? You weren't just picked on a whim, you know. Though now I'm-" She stops herself, Shinji's head hangs, he turns his body away from her. "And you were just telling me earlier that you would take whatever job that can cover your father's treatment. Why the sudden change? Are you afraid?"  
她摇了摇头。“你知道有多少人会真的为了得到那种机会而拼命吗？你不是随便被选中的，你知道的。虽然现在我——”她顿住了，真嗣的头低垂着，他转身背对着她。“而且你之前还跟我说，你会接受任何能支付你父亲治疗费用的工作。为什么突然改变主意？你害怕吗？”

"No! Of course not…" “不！当然不是……”

"They why?" “那为什么？”

Shinji hesitates. "I don't know…" He looks out the car window. "I don't want to hurt anyone, I guess."  
真嗣犹豫了一下。“我不知道……”他望向车窗外面。“我想，我不想伤害任何人。”

Misato gives him a once over, she grasps for the right words to possibly motivate him. But nothing seems to internalize. "You're always going to hurt people, even when you don't mean to. That's just adulthood. It's all about…" She sways her hand left and right. "...finding that balance of getting close to someone without hurting them." She turns to face him, "Shinji, running away from your problems doesn't make them go away. They just make it more difficult to deal with in the future when they become unavoidable. Do you understand?"  
美里上下打量了他一番，试图找到合适的词来激励他。但似乎什么都没能触动他。“你总是会伤害到别人，即使你并非有意。这就是成年人的现实。关键在于……”她左右摆了摆手。“……找到那种在不伤害对方的前提下接近他们的平衡点。”她转向他，“真嗣，逃避问题并不能让它们消失。它们只会让未来处理起来更加困难，当它们变得无法避免时。你明白吗？”

His eyes dart side to side, he rubs the back of his head. "...Yes." She lifts her hands in defeat and resigns to find a song to occupy the two. Eventually, she settles for an English song called "Everything in its Right Place."  
他的眼睛左右游移，挠了挠后脑勺。“……是的。”她举手表示无奈，决定找首歌来打发两人的时间。最终，她选了一首英文歌，名为“Everything in its Right Place”。

On the approach to the train station, Shinji breaks the silence. "We never did get those burgers…"  
在前往火车站的路上，真嗣打破了沉默。“我们一直没吃到那些汉堡……”

"Yep." "嗯。"

"M-maybe we can stop by and grab some?"  
“也许我们可以顺便去买一些？”

"This is your stop, right?" She slows the car to a halt.  
“这是你的站，对吧？”她将车缓缓停下。

Shinji clutches the orientation package to his chest. "Sorry." He wordlessly steps out of the car. Before Misato can press on the gas he leans in. "I-I just wanted to say, thank you for the opportunity again. It was nice to meet you, Ms. Misato."  
真嗣将迎新资料紧紧抱在胸前。“对不起。”他默默地下了车。在美里踩下油门之前，他探身说道：“我……我只是想再次感谢您给我这个机会。很高兴认识您，美里小姐。”

She offers him a flat, toothless smile and looks at the train station. "Sure. You too, kid." Misato gives him one last glance.  
她给了他一个平淡无味的微笑，目光转向火车站。“当然。你也是，孩子。”美里最后看了他一眼。

As soon as Shinji closes the car door, she zooms away, becoming a distant blue dot in a matter of seconds. Disappearing into the now empty streets of Tokyo-03.  
真嗣一关上车门，她便疾驰而去，几秒钟内就变成了远处的一个蓝色小点。消失在如今空荡荡的第三新东京市的街道上。

Everyone appears to be back at work. Suddenly alone in the derelict city, Shinji sighs and slips on his ear buds, preparing for the hour-long train trip back home.  
大家似乎都回到了工作岗位。突然间独自一人在这废弃的城市中，真嗣叹了口气，戴上耳塞，准备踏上长达一小时的回家列车之旅。

---

Within Central Dogma, tech specialists Hyuga and Ibuki circle Misato's desk, piling on papers and data pads detailing schematics, strategies and budgetary concerns. She looks to Ritsuko for help, who only points to her own personal mound of paperwork.  
在中央教条区内，技术专家日向和伊吹围在美里桌旁，不断堆放着纸张和数据板，上面详细记录着图纸、战略和预算问题。她向律子求助，但律子只是指了指自己桌上堆积如山的文件。

Meanwhile, on her personal monitor, Naoko with her chin resting on her fist, flips through surveillance footage. She stops at camera 642-B, which resides in a train station.  
与此同时，在她的私人显示器前，直子手托着下巴，翻阅着监控录像。她停在了 642-B 号摄像头拍摄的画面上，这个摄像头位于一个火车站。

She zooms in and focuses on a boy with a backpack. She leans in closer, unaware of the frenzied work environment that she is in. She gnaws on her lip. Fuyutsuki stands off to the side, more of a glorified trophy than the third in command.  
她放大画面，聚焦在一个背着书包的男孩身上。她凑得更近，未察觉自己正处于一个忙碌的工作环境。她咬着嘴唇。冬月站在一旁，与其说是第三指挥官，不如说更像是个装饰性的奖杯。

Suddenly, the sound of someone clearing her throat snaps her out of her trance. She looks to her right to find her Sub-Commander, Kyoko, gazing at her. Her black framed spectacles do nothing to conceal the dullness in her blue eyes. She rests her hands behind her back. "Akagi."  
突然，有人清嗓子的声音将她从恍惚中唤醒。她向右看去，发现副指挥官京子正注视着她。她那副黑色边框的眼镜丝毫掩盖不了她蓝色眼睛中的呆滞。她将双手背在身后。“赤木。”

Naoko smiles, "Kyoko." 直子微笑道：“京子。”

"I understand you have a plan, but why allow candidate Ikari to leave so easily? Sachiel will arrive any day now and we will need as many pilots as possible on standby."  
“我明白你有计划，但为何要让碇真嗣候选人如此轻易离开？萨基尔随时可能抵达，我们需要尽可能多的驾驶员随时待命。”

The Commander waves a dismissive hand casually, "Don't worry, he'll be back." She says.  
指挥官随意地挥了挥手，“别担心，他会回来的。”她说道。

Misato peers up from her paperwork and attempts to eavesdrop, but is interrupted by Hyuga delivering another data pad. Her view of the Commander and her Deputy becomes more and more obscure with each leaflet added to the pile.  
美里从文件中抬起头，试图偷听，却被日向递来的另一个数据板打断。随着每一份文件的增加，她对指挥官及其副手的视线变得越来越模糊。

"It seems unlikely. He was quite insistent on refusing. If you followed my suggestion to-"  
"看起来不太可能。他非常坚决地拒绝。如果你听从我的建议去——"

"Emotionally blackmail him? You take things too literally, Kyoko. This is what teenagers do, they rebel at every little thing you throw at them, twisting their arm will only draw out the tantrum. There's much you need to understand about being a mother."  
"用情感勒索他？你太字面理解了，Kyoko。这就是青少年做的事，他们对你抛出的每一件小事都会反抗，强迫只会引发他们的脾气。关于如何做一个母亲，你还有很多需要了解的。"

Kyoko's face is blank, as if she didn't register the remark. "Yes, mam."  
Kyoko 的脸上一片空白，仿佛没有听进去那番话。"是的，夫人。"

"Besides, the girls will handle it."  
"再说了，女孩们会搞定的。"

The Sub-Commander's eye twitches ever so slightly. "Pilots Ayanami and Langely are more than capable, yes. But that's beside the point. The UN military have put their trust in us-"  
副指挥官的眼角微微抽动。“绫波零和兰利的能力毋庸置疑，是的。但这不是重点。联合国军方已经把信任托付给了我们——”

"Which we more than earned."  
“这份信任我们当之无愧。”

"...Correct. But if we do not offer results, it is as you say, everyone here is replaceable." Kyoko states. She turns to an approaching Ibuki, who offers a nervous smile and a hot mug of coffee. Kyoko raises an eyebrow. "Do you mind, Lieutenant? We are in the middle of a private conversation."  
"...没错。但如果我们没有成果，正如你所说，这里的每个人都是可替代的。" 响子说道。她转向走近的伊吹，后者紧张地笑了笑，递上一杯热咖啡。响子挑了挑眉。"介意吗，中尉？我们正在进行私人谈话。"

Naoko smiles, "It's fine, Kyoko." She reaches for the hot mug, her long, slender fingers curl around it. "Ah, thank you…" She pauses and tries to recollect Maya Ibuki's name. "Lieutenant." Maya nods and scurries away from Kyoko's dull, yet piercing gaze.  
直子微笑道："没关系，响子。"她伸手去拿热咖啡，她那修长纤细的手指环绕着杯子。"啊，谢谢……"她顿了顿，试图回忆起伊吹麻耶的名字。"中尉。"麻耶点点头，匆匆离开响子那虽平淡却锐利的目光。

"Commander... '' Kyoko leans into Naoko's ear to avoid other eavesdroppers. "I have heard word that the JSSDF have been diverting funds into Tokita's project again. And they have nearly completed their Land Cruiser as well."  
"指挥官... '' 响子靠近直子的耳朵，以免被其他人偷听到。"我听说自卫队再次将资金转向了土歧田的项目。而且他们的陆地巡洋舰也即将完工。"

She looks at Kyoko, and smirks coyly. "I don't see how this is a problem. The more, the merrier, I say. Don't you worry about little Tokita, I have something special in mind for him." She says softly. Her Sub-Commander stares, unamused. "But if you really are worried, I'll put your mind at ease."  
她看着绫子，狡黠地笑了笑。“我不觉得这是个问题。人越多越热闹，我是这么想的。别担心小 Tokita，我对他有个特别的计划。”她轻声说道。她的副指挥官面无表情地盯着她。“但如果你真的担心，我会让你安心的。”

"I never worry." “我从不会担心。”

"Of course." Naoko sighs, "I suppose we could send someone along to…" She looks over her shoulder, right at Fuyutsuki. "...Persuade him."  
“当然。”直子叹了口气，“我想我们可以派个人去……”她回头看了一眼，正好对上了冬月的目光。“……说服他。”

---

"_Stay with me…"_ Shinji softly hums after he strolls down his neighborhood, sweat glistening off his forehead in the afternoon heat. The straps of his backpack dig into his shoulders.  
“陪着我吧……” 真嗣在社区里漫步时轻声哼唱，午后炎热的阳光下，汗水从他的额头闪闪发光。背包的肩带压进了他的肩膀。

The cicadas drown out the sound of his earbuds. He looks to see if anyone is in the empty neighborhood and dares to sing slightly louder. "_Knocking on midnight's door…. Begging you not to go home…Ohhhh-hoooo!"_ He sways ever so slightly, basking in his blessed solitude, "_That season when I-"_  
蝉鸣淹没了他耳机的声音。他环顾空荡荡的社区，鼓起勇气稍微大声唱道：“敲响午夜的门……恳求你别回家……哦哦哦-吼吼！”他轻轻摇摆，享受着这份难得的孤独，“那个季节，我——”

A loud _crash_ breaks through to his ear buds, he slips them off and hears the sound of indistinct shouting and glass breaking coming from his house. Tadeo screeches loudly in the background.  
一声巨响穿透了他的耳机，他摘下耳机，听到自己家里传来模糊的喊叫声和玻璃破碎声。塔德奥在背景中尖叫起来。

"_Mr. Ikari, please let me do that!"_ A muffled feminine voice echoes from the top floor.  
“碇先生，请让我来做吧！”一个模糊的女性声音从顶楼传来。

"_I ah hoogh eh my shelf!"_ A guttural voice shouts back, more sounds of stumbling.  
“我啊，好痛，我的书架！”一个粗哑的声音回喊道，接着是更多跌跌撞撞的声音。

Shinji sighs, "Father's been drinking again."  
真嗣叹了口气，“父亲又喝酒了。”

"_Fine then. Fine!"_ The door slams loudly from the top floor. Shinji walks to the front door to find his father's nurse, Hanako Sato storms out, grunting loudly as she slams the door. She stops in front of him and wraps her coat tightly around her. Hanako attempts to side step him.  
"好吧，好吧！" 楼上传来重重的摔门声。真嗣走向前门，发现他父亲的护士，佐藤花子怒气冲冲地走了出来，一边用力摔门一边大声哼着。她在真嗣面前停下，紧紧裹住自己的外套。佐藤试图绕过他。

Shinji blocks her escape, "Ms. Sato, wait-"  
真嗣挡住了她的去路，"佐藤小姐，请等一下——"

"I'm sorry, Mr. Ikari, but I can't do this anymore! I can't! If your father won't behave, then I suggest that he should be sent to a home."  
"对不起，碇先生，但我不能再这样下去了！我做不到！如果您的父亲不守规矩，那么我建议他应该被送到养老院去。"

"_Shih-hee…"_ Gendo Ikari calls out from the top floor, his hands and face pressed against the window.  
"诗惠…" 碇源堂从顶楼呼唤着，双手和脸紧贴在窗户上。

"See?" Hanako exclaims and points to the window, "He's not even supposed to be out of bed right now."  
"看吧？" 花子惊呼，指向窗户，"他现在根本不应该下床的。"

"I know, I know, I'm sorry. I don't understand what's gotten him so upset, he was so calm this morning-"  
"我知道，我知道，对不起。我不明白他为什么这么生气，他今早还那么平静——"

"_Shih-hee!"_ He calls out again. "_Egh ugh ere!"_  
"诗熙！" 他又喊道。"呃呃呃！"

Shinji shakes his head. "Please. We really appreciate your help here, he just doesn't want to admit it." He sighs, "Why don't you take the rest of the night off? Here." He pulls out his wallet and pulls out several bills. "As an apology for his behaviour. He didn't hurt you, right?"  
真嗣摇了摇头。“拜托了。我们真的很感激你的帮助，他只是不想承认而已。”他叹了口气，“不如你今晚剩下的时间休息一下吧？来。”他掏出钱包，抽出几张钞票。“作为对他行为的道歉。他没有伤害你，对吧？”

Hanako sighs, she crosses her arms. "No, he wouldn't dare. It's just frightening when he gets like that." She gently takes the bills from his hand. "Well, I do need to get my daughter something for her birthday... " Hanako wags her finger at him. "You tell him if he has another tantrum while I'm trying to help, I'll quit."  
花子叹了口气，她交叉双臂。“不，他不敢。只是当他那样时，真的很吓人。”她轻轻地从他手中接过钞票。“嗯，我确实需要给我女儿买些生日礼物...”花子用手指着他。“你告诉他，如果他再在我帮忙时发脾气，我就辞职。”

He rubs the back of his head. "Yes mam."  
他揉了揉后脑勺。“是的，女士。”

"_SHIH-HEE!"_  "诗熙！"

She shakes her head and pats him on the arm. "Good luck, hon."  
她摇了摇头，拍了拍他的手臂。"祝你好运，亲爱的。"

He suppresses a blush and gives her a wave. Shinji takes a deep breath and enters the belly of the beast.  
他强忍住脸红，向她挥了挥手。真嗣深吸一口气，踏入了这头巨兽的腹地。

When he crosses through the doorway, he looks up to see his father standing above the staircase with a powerful light shining behind him, masking him in a silhouette similar to the Commander when she was on deck. He leans into a cane with one hand, a bottle of Sake in the other. His pristine lab coat and red sweater exchanged for a stained bathrobe and fuzzy slippers. The once distinguished goatee, now a ragged beard.  
当他穿过门口时，抬头看到父亲站在楼梯上方，一束强光从他身后照射过来，使他的轮廓与指挥官在甲板上时的剪影相似。他一手倚着拐杖，另一手拿着一瓶清酒。他那件整洁的白大褂和红色毛衣换成了沾满污渍的浴袍和毛茸茸的拖鞋。曾经优雅的山羊胡，如今已是一团凌乱的胡须。

Shinji sighs, "Good afternoon, Father." Gendo grunts and takes a generous swig from the bottle. "Ms. Sato is very upset. You really should just let her help you."  
真嗣叹了口气，"下午好，父亲。"源堂咕哝一声，从瓶中大口喝了一口。"佐藤小姐非常生气。你真的应该让她帮你。"

He waves a hand. "Bagh."  
他挥了挥手。"啧。"

Gendo's cat, a solid grey tabby named Tadeo, a name which he doesn't respond to for obvious reasons, bolts down the stairs and hisses at Shinji, his tail spiked.  
源堂的猫，一只纯灰色的虎斑猫，名叫塔德奥，这个名字显然它并不理会，飞快地冲下楼梯，对着真嗣竖起尾巴发出嘶嘶声。

"Easy buddy…" Shinji chuckles nervously, the cranky old cat only likes him during lunch.  
“放轻松，伙计……”真嗣紧张地笑着，这只脾气暴躁的老猫只有在午饭时才对他友好。

"Eeesheee, Ah-eo." Gendo slurs out, and Tadeo miraculously calms down, jumping into his cat house.  
“咿咻，啊喔。”源堂含糊地说道，塔德奥奇迹般地平静下来，跳进了它的猫窝。

Gendo sits on his stairlift and presses the down button with his cane. The machine slowly whirs down the staircase. "Why igh ew ogh ere?" The descent is painfully slow.  
源渡坐在他的楼梯升降椅上，用拐杖按下下降按钮。机器缓缓地沿着楼梯嗡嗡下降。“为什么这么慢？”下降过程痛苦地缓慢。

"Father, you really should be resting right now…"  
“父亲，您现在真的应该休息一下…”

"Ohngh ange eh shubegh." “哦，换个舒服的姿势。”

"I'm not trying to change the subject." Shinji shakes his head and presses the reverse button on the stairlift. It sputters and goes backwards. "Father, please…"  
"我不是想转移话题。" 真嗣摇摇头，按下了楼梯升降椅的倒退按钮。它噼啪作响，向后移动。"父亲，请……"

"How hare ew!" Gendo protests as the machine ascends. "Ah ahm eur fau-her!"  
"你怎么这样！" 源堂抗议道，随着机器上升。"我是你爸！"

He follows his father up the staircase. "How about you tell me why you're so upset while I clean up the mess you made, okay?" He points to the scattered beer bottle near Gendo's bed.  
他跟着父亲上楼。"不如你告诉我为什么这么生气，同时我清理你弄乱的这一摊，好吗？" 他指向源堂床边散落的啤酒瓶。

Gendo stares at the pile of glass on the floor. "Hrrr." He takes another swig of sake.  
源堂盯着地板上的一堆玻璃碎片。“哼。”他又喝了一口清酒。

Shinji pulls out a broom and dustpan from one of the side closets, the one adjacent to the master bedroom. "So?"  
真嗣从旁边的壁橱里拿出扫帚和簸箕，那个靠近主卧室的壁橱。“所以呢？”

His father hobbles back and forth, his best attempt at pacing. "I ol ew, no ogh ere."  
他的父亲一瘸一拐地来回走动，尽力做出踱步的样子。“我老了，不中用了。”

"I had to go there father, I couldn't turn down a job offer." He shakes his head at the half-truth.  
"我必须去那儿，父亲，我不能拒绝工作邀请。" 他对这个半真半假的说法摇了摇头。

"Ighs anherous!" "伊格斯·安赫鲁斯！"

He stops sweeping. "Dangerous? You know about the robots?"  
他停下扫地。"危险？你知道那些机器人吗？"

"Of ourshe I ow a-ou heh EFAs! I iheheghed em!" Gendo attempts another swing and stumbles, "Ahs nogh whaghs anherous." Shinji blinks at him, confused. "Ol hah."  
"我们的她我拥有啊-哦嘿 EFAs！我呵呵地笑了他们！" 源渡尝试再次挥动，却踉跄了一下，"啊，搞不懂什么意思。" 真嗣困惑地看着他，"哦，哈。"

Shinji picks up the dustpan. "What?" He empties it into a nearby bin.  
真嗣拿起簸箕。"什么？" 他将里面的垃圾倒进附近的垃圾桶。

"Ol hagh!" "哦，哈！"

"Old hag? Ms. Akagi?" "老太婆？赤木小姐？"

"Yesh." "是的。"

Shinji groans and sits down. "I dunno, Father. She was very nice to me." _Nicer than you_. "I think you're just drunk-"  
真嗣呻吟着坐下。“我不知道，父亲。她对我很好。”比你好。“我觉得你只是喝醉了——”

"I ahm noh hrungh!" Gendo gurgles out, he slams the bottle on his desk. He eases himself onto his chair and fishes through the loose papers that litter his dusty desk. He pulls out a pen and attempts to write something. His good hand shakes violently. He grunts and grips it in an attempt to keep it steady, his breathing frantic. The Kanji comes out jagged and illegible. He whimpers, the humiliation boiling into rage as he swipes away at the paper. Gendo clutches his head tightly.  
“我啊，才不是废物！”源渡咕哝着，猛地将酒瓶砸在桌上。他缓缓坐进椅子，伸手在散乱的文件堆中摸索。抽出一支笔，试图写些什么。他那只健全的手剧烈颤抖。他低吼一声，用力握紧笔杆，试图稳住，呼吸急促。汉字写得歪歪扭扭，难以辨认。他呜咽着，屈辱感化作怒火，一把将纸张扫落。源渡紧紧抱住头。

The boy watches the shadow of his once terrifying monolith of a father hunched over, struggling with paper after paper. He sits across from him on the bed. Shinji considers reaching for his shoulder, but hesitates. Despite taking care of him every day, feeding him, helping him get dressed. Even playing chess with him or letting him listen to the Cello, it still felt as though he didn't know the man.  
男孩注视着曾经令人生畏的父亲的影子，此刻正佝偻着身子，一张接一张地与纸张搏斗。他坐在床对面。真嗣考虑着是否要伸手搭他的肩膀，却犹豫了。尽管每天照顾他，喂他吃饭，帮他穿衣。甚至陪他下棋或让他听大提琴，他依然觉得对这个人知之甚少。

Shinji may as well just be another nurse to his father, as far as he knows.  
对真嗣的父亲来说，他或许和另一个护士没什么两样，至少他是这么认为的。

"Well, you don't have to worry. I refused the job." He says. Gendo stops writing and slightly turns his head to the boy. "They asked me to pilot one of those EVA's, they said that humanity is under attack but… I think they found the wrong person." Gendo reaches for the bottle again and takes a deep chug. "...What should I do, Father?" Shinji asks, leaning in closer.  
"嗯，你不必担心。我拒绝了那份工作。" 他说道。源渡停下笔，微微转头看向少年。"他们让我去驾驶那些 EVA，说人类正遭受攻击，但……我觉得他们找错了人。" 源渡再次伸手去拿酒瓶，猛灌一口。"...我该怎么办，父亲？" 真嗣问道，身体前倾。

He swallows the drink, it dribbles down his chin as he scowls. "Leh ih burh."  
他咽下酒，酒液顺着下巴滴落，他皱眉道："让它烧。"

"...Let it burn?" Shinji asks. Gendo nods, the boy hangs his head. "Should've figured that would be your advice." He doesn't respond. "I'm going to start dinner." Shinji stands up and walks out the door, turning at the frame. "Next time, please be nice to Ms. Hanako." Gendo doesn't look his way, he only nods.  
"...让它烧？" 真嗣问。源渡点头，少年垂下头。"早该猜到你会这么建议。" 他没有回应。"我去准备晚饭。" 真嗣站起身，走出房门，在门框处转身。"下次，请对花子小姐好一点。" 源渡没有看向他，只是点了点头。

Shinji nods as well, he taps the door frame on his way out. "Good talk."  
真嗣也点点头，出门时轻敲了一下门框。“聊得不错。”

He goes down to the kitchen, committing to never thinking about NERV, Misato, Rei or EVA's ever again.  
他下到厨房，决心再也不去想 NERV、美里、绫波或 EVA 这些事。

---

The cicadas are relentless tonight. Shinji pulls at the damp shirt clinging to his chest as he lays back in his bed, staring at the ceiling, his music providing no solace or distraction. If he looked at the right spot in the corner of his ceiling, his vision would start to distort and make the spartan room become wider.  
今晚的蝉鸣异常执着。真嗣扯了扯紧贴胸口的湿衬衫，躺在床上盯着天花板，音乐并未带来安慰或分散注意力。如果他盯着天花板的某个角落看，视野就会开始扭曲，让这简朴的房间显得更宽阔。

Despite his best efforts, the day's events buzz through him, determined to be retold. Receiving those strange letters in the mail. As soon as he opened it, a waft of perfume tickled his nose.  
尽管他竭尽全力，当天的事件仍在他脑海中嗡嗡作响，决心要被重述。收到那些奇怪的信件。一打开它，一股香水味就轻拂过他的鼻子。

He didn't understand most of the jargon in the invitation, but it was very flattering. A second envelope was there as well, one from Misato with directions where to meet and a rather lewd picture of her. Her cleavage was circled with a sharpie. "Look for these! ;)" was written on the side. It still resided in his orientation package.  
他不明白邀请函中的大部分术语，但感觉非常荣幸。还有第二封信，来自美里，里面有会面地点的指示和她一张相当露骨的照片。她的乳沟被记号笔圈了出来。旁边写着“找这个！ ;)”这张照片仍留在他的迎新资料包里。

Strangely enough, the memory of that overpowering, unidentifiable perfume stuck more to him than the picture of Misato. The alien feeling sat in his stomach, a mix of anxiety and excitement, as if a spell was cast on him upon opening the letter and inhaling its contents.  
说来奇怪，那种压倒性的、无法辨认的香水味在他心中留下的印象比美里的照片还要深刻。那种异样的感觉盘踞在他的胃里，混合着焦虑与兴奋，仿佛打开信件并吸入其内容的那一刻，他就中了某种咒语。

His heart raced when he entered the Commander's office and realized the perfume belonged to her, despite not finding her all that attractive.  
当他走进指挥官的办公室，意识到那香水属于她时，他的心跳加速了，尽管他并不觉得她有多吸引人。

Pretty, but too old. 漂亮，但年纪太大了。

But it wasn't enough to sway the terror that entered his mind at the idea of piloting a seventy metre tall killing machine. Upon his worst fears being confirmed, all he could think about was how he had the urge to destroy everything in sight. To knock down the skyscrapers like brittle trees. To stomp the Geofront pyramid flat.  
但这种想法不足以驱散他脑海中驾驶一台七十米高的杀人机器的恐惧。当最坏的担忧被证实后，他满脑子都是想要摧毁眼前一切的冲动。要把摩天大楼像脆弱的树木一样推倒。要把地底都市的巨大金字塔踏平。

Mr. Tsuji once described the feeling as "The call of the void."  
冢地先生曾将这种感觉描述为“虚空的召唤”。

It was better this way, the next candidate will surely have a better temperament. And those other pilots, the girls, will have someone they can rely on.  
这样更好，下一个候选人肯定会有更好的性情。而那些其他飞行员，那些女孩们，也会有一个可以依靠的人。

He just hoped this new pilot would be recruited before the next attack.  
他只希望这位新飞行员能在下次攻击前被招募进来。

Suddenly, a knock echoes throughout the house. Shinji turns to look at this clock. Ten PM. It couldn't be Ms. Hanako or his tutor, Mr. Tsuji. And no one else ever visits except-  
突然，一阵敲门声在屋内回荡。真嗣转身看向时钟。晚上十点。不可能是花子小姐或他的家教辻先生。除此之外，再无他人来访——

More knocking, a gentle rap on the door. He climbs out of the bed and tiptoes down the stairs, careful not to wake Father.  
又是一阵敲门声，轻轻地叩响了门。他从床上爬起，蹑手蹑脚地下楼，小心翼翼地不吵醒父亲。

Shinji opens the doors to find a familiar face.  
真嗣打开门，映入眼帘的是一张熟悉的面孔。

His face lights up, "Mr. Fuyutsuki!" Fuyutsuki smiles and raises an index finger to his mouth. "S-sorry."  
他的脸亮了起来，“Fuyutsuki 先生！”Fuyutsuki 微笑着，将食指举到嘴边。“对-对不起。”

"It's all right. Is your father awake?"  
“没关系。你父亲醒着吗？”

He looks back, surprised."N-no. Do you wanna talk to him?"  
他惊讶地回头看，“没-没有。你想和他说话吗？”

Fuyutsuki shakes his head. "It's best if he doesn't see me. Would you join an old man for a walk?"  
冬月摇了摇头。“他最好还是别见到我。你愿意陪一个老人家散散步吗？”

---

The boy observes the closest thing he has to a Grandfather's gait as he walks ahead of him through old, familiar routes. Fuyutsuki insists they travel to an old park from Shinji's childhood, one surrounded by bleachers and two strange mounds that are dressed with black pine trees.  
男孩观察着这位几乎算是他祖父的人的步伐，跟在他身后走过那些熟悉的老路。冬月坚持要带他去一个旧公园，那是真嗣童年的回忆之地，四周环绕着看台和两座奇怪的土丘，上面种满了黑松树。

He is not nearly as spry as he remembered, more hesitation, his breathing sounds oddly ragged. Mr. Fuyutsuki still keeps his hands behind his back as he walks. An early memory of little Shinji clutching the old man's pant leg to avoid being separated on their walks shoots through his chest like a bullet.  
他的步伐远不如记忆中那般轻快，多了几分迟疑，呼吸听起来也异常粗重。冬月先生依旧双手背在身后走着。真嗣幼时紧紧抓着老人的裤腿，以免在散步时被分开的早期记忆，如子弹般穿透他的胸膛。

Fuyutsuki smiles at the sight of an old playground. "Ah, there it is." They walk to an old bench, he winces as he sits down. "I used to take you here once a week to play." He points to monkey bars, a look of nostalgia on his face. "Do you remember the girl that liked to climb those? She always wanted to make it to the top. I think you tried to help her once." He chuckles raggedly, "She didn't like that at all."  
冬月看到旧游乐场的景象，微笑着说：“啊，就在那儿。”他们走向一张旧长椅，他坐下时皱了皱眉。“我过去每周带你来这里玩一次。”他指向猴架，脸上露出怀旧的神情。“你还记得那个喜欢爬猴架的女孩吗？她总是想爬到顶端。我想你曾试图帮过她一次。”他粗哑地笑了笑，“她可一点儿也不喜欢那样。”

Shinji rubs the back of his head. "I don't think so."  
真嗣挠了挠后脑勺。“我不记得了。”

He sighs. "That's a shame. I always hoped the two of you would get along. You always were avoiding the other children. You preferred making sandcastles if my memory still serves me." The old man suppresses a fit of coughs, Shinji realizes that he was attempting to laugh. "I remember once, you tried to chase after a ball on the road." He wheezes again. "I don't think I ran that fast in fifteen years."  
他叹了口气。“真可惜。我一直希望你们俩能相处得好。你总是避开其他孩子。如果我没记错的话，你更喜欢堆沙堡。”老人抑制住一阵咳嗽，真嗣意识到他刚才试图笑出来。“我记得有一次，你试图追着路上的球跑。”他又喘息了一下。“我想那是我十五年来跑得最快的一次。”

The boy chuckles nervously, "Sorry about that."  
男孩紧张地轻笑，“抱歉。”

Fuyutsuki waves his hand, "Don't be. Silly memories like that-" his expression darkens, "-They help me through the day." He gently grasps Shinji's shoulder and he doesn't flinch. "I missed you, son. I'm sorry we haven't spoken sooner."  
冬月挥了挥手，“别介意。像那样的傻记忆——”他的表情变得阴沉，“——它们帮我度过每一天。”他轻轻抓住真嗣的肩膀，真嗣没有退缩。“我想你了，孩子。很抱歉我们没能早点联系。”

Exclusively to this individual, Shinji returns the gesture without discomfort. "It's okay. I've been pretty busy too, I actually had a job interview. At the Geofront! Can you believe it? You know, the one at Tokyo-03?"  
只对这个人的时候，真嗣没有不适地回以同样的动作。“没关系。我也一直挺忙的，我其实有个工作面试。在 Geofront！你能相信吗？你知道的，在东京-03 的那个！”

He lets go of his shoulder and frowns. "I know. I work there."  
他松开了搭在他肩上的手，皱起眉头。“我知道。我在那里工作。”

Shinji shakes his head in confusion. "Then why didn't you…sorry. You must have been busy." They both stare at the floor. "Were you the one who put in a good word for me?"  
真嗣困惑地摇了摇头。“那为什么你没……抱歉。你一定很忙。”两人都盯着地板。“是你为我美言了几句吗？”

Fuyutsuki grimaces in pain, but not from a physical ailment. "No. The truth is..." He looks at the boy. "You are one in a million. You were chosen for your potential alone." He clenches his gnarled hand into a fist.  
冬月面露痛苦之色，但这并非来自身体上的不适。“不。事实是……”他看向少年。“你是万里挑一的。你被选中仅仅是因为你的潜力。”他紧握着那只布满皱纹的手，攥成了拳头。

The boy's enthusiasm sizzles. "Did the Commander send you? Or Ms. Misato? I-I'm sorry, but my answer is still the same."  
男孩的热情如火花般迸发。“是司令派你来的吗？还是美里小姐？我……我很抱歉，但我的回答依然不变。”

"No, son. I-" He takes a shallow breath. He turns to Shinji, his innocent eyes gauging him. Fuyutsuki's shaking hand reaches into his coat pocket. "There's something I need to show you." He pulls out one picture and points to a stranger in Shinji's mind, yet also, his first companion. "Do you know who this is?"  
“不，孩子。我——”他轻轻吸了口气。转身面对真嗣，那双纯真的眼睛审视着他。冬月颤抖的手伸进外套口袋。“我有样东西必须给你看。”他拿出一张照片，指向真嗣心中既陌生又似初识的那个人。“你知道这是谁吗？”

Shinji peers at the picture, studying it. A woman holds a baby, another woman on her right, in pink glasses. On the woman's left, his father. He gasps and puts the picture right up to his eye. "That's my mother…"  
真嗣凝视着照片，仔细端详。一位女子抱着婴儿，她右边是另一位戴粉色眼镜的女子，左边则是他的父亲。他倒吸一口气，将照片贴近眼前。“那是我母亲……”

"Yes." Fuyutsuki confirms solemnly.  
“是的。” 福音津确认道，神情庄重。

He brushes his finger against the photo, a wave of memories and scents crash through him, of her singing, playing the cello. A darker memory trespasses. "_Don't look away, baby!"_  
他用手指轻抚照片，一股记忆与气息的浪潮涌入心头，她唱歌、拉大提琴的画面浮现。一段更阴暗的记忆闯入。“别移开视线，宝贝！”

Shinji shakes his head. "Father said there were no photo's left…"  
真嗣摇了摇头。“父亲说没有留下任何照片……”

"We all agreed to leave the past behind us. But, the truth is…" He reaches into his pocket for the other picture, "...I'm a selfish old man."  
"我们都同意放下过去。但事实是…" 他伸手从口袋里掏出另一张照片，"…我是个自私的老头。"

The boy frowns, "That's not true." He looks at the ID card in Fuyutsuki's hand. "What's that?" The old man hands him the card with a trembling hand. He inspects it. "This is that girl I saw at NERV. The one with blue hair." Fuyutsuki slowly nods. "Wait…" He puts both photos side by side.  
男孩皱起眉头，"那不是真的。" 他看着冬月手中的身份证。"那是什么？" 老人颤抖着手递给他卡片。他仔细查看。"这是我在 NERV 见过的那个蓝发女孩。" 冬月缓缓点头。"等等…" 他把两张照片并排放在一起。

Shinji can hear his heart beating through his chest. "Mr. Fuyutsuki… who is this?"  
真嗣能听到自己的心跳透过胸膛传来。"冬月先生… 这是谁？"

Fuyutsuki stares at the ground. "Isn't it obvious?"  
冬月盯着地面。“这不是显而易见的吗？”

"What are you saying, is she… a relative of Mother's?"  
“你在说什么，她难道是……母亲的亲戚？”

He slowly nods. "She is… of your mother."  
他缓缓点头。“她是……与你母亲有关的人。”

"I-I don't understand, who is she to me? A cousin, a sister?" The dread that was sitting in his stomach slowly melts into relief.  
“我……我不明白，她对我来说是谁？表妹，还是姐姐？”他心中盘踞的恐惧缓缓化为了释然。

The old man shakes his head. "I… don't know. Only you can answer that question." He frowns, his fingernails digging into his palm. Fuyutsuki turns to the lost boy. "All I know is that she's in danger."  
老人摇了摇头。“我……不知道。只有你能回答这个问题。”他皱起眉头，指甲深深陷入掌心。冬月转向那个迷茫的男孩。“我只知道她正处于危险之中。”

His father's warning flies over his head. "From who? D-do you mean from the Angels?"  
父亲的警告在他耳边掠过。“来自谁？你是说……来自使徒吗？”

Fuyutsuki's jaw tightens. "Yes. From the Angels."  
冬月紧咬牙关。“是的。来自使徒。”

"But-" Shinji shoots up from the bench, pacing back and forth. "I can't pilot. I'm not a fighter, I'm…" He slumps back down on the bench. "...I'm a coward. A sneak."  
“但是——” 真嗣从长椅上猛地站起，来回踱步。“我不能驾驶。我不是战士，我是……”他再次颓然坐回长椅。“……我是个懦夫。一个偷偷摸摸的人。”

He turns to Shinji, "I can't promise that you won't get hurt. The life of an EVA pilot isn't about being a hero, it's... Many people are going to try to lie to you. To make you say what they want to hear. But don't you ever fool yourself into believing you're weak." He sighs, a look of weary sentiment lining his face. "Your mother would be so proud if she could see you now."  
他转向真嗣，“我不能保证你不会受伤。EVA 驾驶员的生活不是关于成为英雄，而是……很多人会试图欺骗你。让你说出他们想听的话。但永远不要欺骗自己，认为自己软弱。”他叹了口气，脸上流露出疲惫的情感。“如果你母亲能看到你现在的样子，她一定会非常骄傲。”

Shinji wrings his hands together. "What should I do?" He asks softly.  
真嗣双手紧握在一起。“我该怎么办？”他轻声问道。

"What do you want to do?" Shinji looks up and stares at him quizzically. No one ever asked him that before. Words can't escape the boy's throat. The two remain silent, the cicadas filling the air of tension alongside the foggy night. Fuyutsuki regards him evenly.  
“你想做什么？”真嗣抬头，疑惑地盯着他。以前从没有人问过他这个问题。话语卡在少年的喉咙里，说不出来。两人沉默着，蝉鸣与雾蒙蒙的夜晚一同填补了紧张的空气。冬月平静地注视着他。

He gulps, "I…" Shinji looks down at the picture. "I need to protect her."  
他咽了口唾沫，“我……”真嗣低头看着那张照片。“我必须保护她。”

Fuyutsuki grabs the boy's shoulder one last time. "Don't ever be afraid of failure, son." He releases him with a gentle pat. "You should get some rest."  
冬月最后一次抓住男孩的肩膀。“永远不要害怕失败，孩子。”他轻轻拍了拍他，松开了手。“你应该休息一下。”

Shinji sits up, "I'll walk you to your car."  
真嗣坐起身来，“我送你到车那边。”

He waves a hand playfully. "Ah, don't you worry about me. I need… time to think." Fuyutsuki offers a weak smile. "Take care of yourself, young man."  
他俏皮地挥了挥手。“啊，别担心我。我需要……时间思考。”冬月露出一个虚弱的微笑。“照顾好自己，年轻人。”

The boy smiles. "Good night, Mr. Fuyutsuki." He disappears in the fog, leaving the weary old man alone on the bench.  
男孩微笑着。“晚安，冬月先生。”他在雾中消失，留下疲惫的老人独自坐在长椅上。

The wind blows a rusty swing back and forth. The old playground that once brought him solace is now a grim reminder. It's not a place of joy. It's a graveyard.  
风吹动着生锈的秋千来回摆动。曾经带给他慰藉的老旧游乐场，如今却成了阴森的提醒。这里不再是欢乐之地，而是一座墓地。

"You're wrong, Shinji. You're not the coward…"  
“你错了，真嗣。你不是懦夫……”

Fuyutsuki stares at his wretched hands, as if he could see his own reflection. The warm expression twisting into a sneer.  
冬月凝视着自己那双可憎的手，仿佛能从中看到自己的倒影。那温暖的表情扭曲成了一抹讥笑。

"I am." “我是。”

---

Shinji stares down at the resting figure sleeping on his back. Tadeo is curled comfortably on his chest. Normally, waking up his father in the middle of his deep sleep would cause him to be subjected to an hour of unintelligible beration.  
真嗣低头看着仰面熟睡的身影。塔德奥舒适地蜷缩在他的胸口。通常情况下，在父亲深睡时唤醒他，会招致长达一小时的难以理解的责骂。

But tonight, he didn't give a damn.  
但今晚，他毫不在乎。

He shakes Gendo's shoulder. "Father. Wake up."  
他摇晃着源堂的肩膀。“父亲。醒醒。”

After a few seconds, his father blinks into blurry consciousness. He rubs the sleep out of his eyes and stares at him. "...Yooo-ee?"  
几秒钟后，他的父亲眨了眨眼，意识逐渐模糊地恢复。他揉了揉眼睛，盯着他看。“...真嗣？”

"No, Father. It's me, Shinji." Gendo groans and turns his back to him, gently cupping Tadeo so he doesn't get smothered. The cat wiggles out of his grip and scurries downstairs. "There's something I need to talk to you about."  
"不，父亲。是我，真嗣。" 源堂呻吟一声，转身背对他，轻轻托住塔德奥以免被压到。猫儿扭动着从他手中挣脱，匆匆跑下楼。"我有件事需要和您谈谈。"

"Noh-ow." He rolls further away into the bed.  
"不——行。" 他翻了个身，更深地埋进被窝。"

Shinji goes around the other side of the bed. Gendo grunts and buries his head into the pillow. Shinji hovers the photo of his mother in front of Gendo's face. After a moment he looks up and gasps, reaching for the picture. "Yoo-ee…"  
真嗣绕到床的另一侧。源堂咕哝着，将头埋进枕头里。真嗣举起母亲的照片，凑到源堂眼前。片刻后，他抬起头，倒吸一口气，伸手去抓那张照片。"唯……"

He snatches it before his father can grab the photo. Gendo snarls and crawls to get closer to grab it. Shinji switches it with the ID card of the mysterious blue haired girl. "Who is this?" Gendo stops, he breathes raggedly. Slowly he turns his palm from a claw and faces it upwards, his way of asking politely. Shinji drops the card in his hand. He stares at the photo for a good minute. The analog clock in his room ticks loudly. "...Father?"  
他抢在父亲之前夺过照片。源渡咆哮着，匍匐前进试图再次抢夺。真嗣迅速将照片换成那位蓝发神秘女孩的身份证。“这是谁？”源渡停下，呼吸急促。他缓缓将手掌从爪状展开，掌心向上，这是他表达礼貌的方式。真嗣将卡片放入他手中。他凝视着照片足足一分钟。房间里的挂钟滴答作响。“……父亲？”

"R-r-" Gendo clutches his throat to force himself to articulate.  
“呃-呃-”源渡紧抓喉咙，强迫自己发音。

"Rei…" He gasps out. “绫波…”他喘息着说出。

"Oh, Gh-." Gendo clutches his head. "Oh, Ghogh. Nho…" He growls, his voice cracking. "Nho, nho, nho…."  
"哦，天哪……" 源堂捂着头。"哦，天哪。不……" 他咆哮着，声音嘶哑。"不，不，不……"

"Is she… my sister?" Shinji asks. Gendo shakes his head. "A relative of mothers?" He shakes his head again, fighting back tears. "Then who?" His father struggles to get out of bed, reaching for his cane which falls over. "Father, wait-" He hobbles on one foot, clutching his nearby desk for support.  
"她是……我妹妹吗？" 真嗣问道。源堂摇了摇头。"是母亲的亲戚吗？" 他又摇了摇头，强忍泪水。"那她是谁？" 他的父亲挣扎着下床，伸手去拿倒在地上的拐杖。"父亲，等等——" 他一瘸一拐地用一只脚跳着，紧紧抓住旁边的书桌以支撑自己。

Gendo sits down on the desk, clearing space for his pen and paper. He clutches his wrist so tight, Shinji could swear he could hear cracking sounds. He struggles with the Kanji, biting into his lip as he whimpers in frustration.  
源堂坐在书桌上，腾出地方放笔和纸。他紧握手腕，用力之大，真嗣几乎以为能听到骨头断裂的声音。他艰难地写着汉字，咬着嘴唇，因沮丧而发出呜咽声。

Shinji looks around his father's spartan room. No paintings, certificates or photo's decorate the thinning walls, only fist sized holes. The only piece of furniture other than his bed and desk is a dusty piano. He sighs. "Never mind, Father. I just wanted to tell you that-"  
真嗣环顾父亲简朴的房间。墙上没有装饰画、证书或照片，只有拳头大小的洞。除了床和书桌，唯一的家具是一架积满灰尘的钢琴。他叹了口气。“没关系，父亲。我只是想告诉你——”

"Waigh!" Gendo calls out. He smoothens the crumpled paper and presents it to him with trembling hands.  
“等等！”源渡喊道。他抚平皱巴巴的纸张，颤抖着双手递给他。

The boy learns to discern the scribbles, it clearly spells…  
男孩学会了辨认这些潦草的字迹，显然是……

FAMILY. 家庭。

Gendo breaks into sobs. Shinji shakes his head. "I thought you said-"  
源渡突然失声痛哭。真嗣摇了摇头。“我以为你说过——”

His father clings to Shinji's shirt and convulses into a tearful mess. He stands stiffly, unsure what to do. This is the first time his father ever came close to holding him. Gendo grabs his own throat to force his tongue to articulate. "I'm sorry, Rei…" His father hisses.  
他的父亲紧紧抓住真嗣的衬衫，颤抖着泪流满面。他僵硬地站着，不知所措。这是父亲第一次如此接近地拥抱他。源渡抓住自己的喉咙，强迫自己的舌头清晰地表达。“对不起，丽……”他的父亲低声说道。

Gendo releases the vice grip on his throat and looks up to him. Shinji doesn't make a move to comfort him. "I'm going back." He states. "I'm going to pilot the EVA."  
源堂松开了掐住他脖子的手，抬头看向他。真嗣没有做出安慰他的举动。“我要回去。”他声明道。“我要去驾驶 EVA。”

His father shakes his head violently. "Nho. Nho!"  
他的父亲猛烈地摇着头。“不。不！”

"To protect her." “为了保护她。”

Gendo releases his grasp on Shinji's shirt and slumps to the floor, his eyes widened in horror. The two stare at each other. His father leans back against the desk. "There's somebody I need to call." Shinji says calmly as he walks out of his fathers room.  
源渡松开了抓住真嗣衬衫的手，瘫坐在地板上，眼中满是惊恐。两人对视着。他的父亲靠在桌子上。“我需要打个电话。”真嗣平静地说着，走出了父亲的房间。

He turns back to see his father huddled into a fetal position, muttering to himself incoherently.  
他回头一看，只见父亲蜷缩成胎儿的姿势，语无伦次地喃喃自语。

---

"Mhmm…" “嗯……”

Deep within the bowels of her office, Naoko stares wistfully at her computer monitor as she bites her lip.  
在办公室的深处，直子凝视着电脑屏幕，若有所思地咬着嘴唇。

Her cell phone rings, she answers it. "Hello?"  
她的手机响起，她接了起来。“喂？”

The voice she hopes for responds. "_Commander Akagi?"_  
她期待的声音回应道：“赤城指挥官？”

She smirks, "Speaking." 她微微一笑，"在听。"

"_Hello Commander- Naoko. It's Shinji. We had dinner earlier?"_  
"你好，指挥官——直子。我是真嗣。我们之前一起吃过晚饭吧？"

Naoko holds for a pause and yawns. "Oh, yes! That's right. How are you, Shinji? I didn't expect you to call at this hour."  
直子停顿了一下，打了个哈欠。"哦，对！没错。你还好吗，真嗣？没想到你这时候会打电话来。"

"_Oh, d-did I wake you?"_  
"哦，我...我吵醒你了吗？"

"Yes you did, but how can I help you?"  
"是的，但你有什么需要帮忙的吗？"

"_O-oh. I'm sorry to disturb you. I'll call you back in the morning-"_  
"哦...哦。很抱歉打扰你。我早上再打给你吧-"

"Oh, come now. What did I tell you about being sorry?" She leans back in the chair, her legs stretched. "You can call me anytime."  
“哦，得了吧。我跟你说过多少次不要道歉了？”她向后靠在椅子上，双腿伸展开来。“你随时可以给我打电话。”

"_Right, s-"_ Shinji stops himself, her smile widens. "_I know I said that my answer would be the same, but…"_  
“对，就——”真嗣顿住了，她的笑容更灿烂了。“我知道我说过我的回答不会变，但是……”

"But?" “但是？”

"_I thought about it, and… I'll do it."_ Resolve burns through his voice. Her breathing intensifies. "_I'll pilot the EVA. I-If you didn't find someone else yet, I mean. I don't want to impose-"_  
"我考虑过了，而且……我愿意做。" 他的声音中透着坚定。她的呼吸变得急促。"我会驾驶 EVA。我是说，如果你还没找到其他人选的话。我不想强加于人-"

She sighs. "Not at all! I was frankly worried I'd have to choose someone else, so this is a win-win for me. How about, Misato comes and picks you up at the same spot. Ten AM sharp and we get you all sorted out?"  
她叹了口气。"一点也不！老实说，我还在担心得选别人，所以这对我来说是个双赢的局面。这样吧，Misato 会准时十点来接你，我们把一切都安排妥当？"

Shinji stammers on the other end of the line. "_A-are you sure? It's not too late?"_  
电话那头的真嗣结巴着说。"你-你确定吗？还不算太晚吗？"

"Oh, heavens no." Suddenly, the sterile blue lights of her office blare to a furious red. "You have all the time in the world."  
"哦，天哪，不。" 突然间，她办公室里那刺眼的蓝色灯光变成了狂怒的红色。"你有的是时间。"

---

Shinji dreamed of a lightning storm. The cracks of thunder sounding like woeful wails.  
真嗣梦见了一场雷暴。雷声轰鸣，宛如悲痛的哀嚎。

Hidden by altocumulus clouds, the sky is stained red as the sun fully rises. Shinji waits outside the train station, half-awake. The city is abandoned, not unlike earlier. Yet something feels… off.  
被高积云遮蔽的天空，随着太阳完全升起而染成了红色。真嗣在火车站外等待，半梦半醒。城市空无一人，和之前一样。但不知为何，感觉有些……不对劲。

Regardless. For once in his life, he has a mission.  
无论如何。他一生中难得有一次使命。

He shakes away the thought as he notices a blue car approaching from the distance. He slips off his ear buds and moves towards the approaching Alpine.  
他甩开这个念头，注意到远处一辆蓝色汽车驶来。他摘下耳塞，向接近的阿尔派走去。

The car door swings open unceremoniously. Shinji peers inside to see Misato staring through the window, not ignoring him like last time, more as though she was staring at something miles away. Her thick, voluminous hair is tied into a messy bun, the bags under her eyes matching her purple hair. She slowly turns to him, her amber eyes dull and weary. "Good morning." Misato finally says.  
车门随意地打开了。真嗣朝车内望去，看到美里透过窗户凝视着远方，不像上次那样无视他，更像是在凝视着遥远的地方。她浓密蓬松的头发扎成了一个凌乱的发髻，眼下的黑眼圈与她紫色的头发相映成趣。她缓缓转向他，琥珀色的眼睛黯淡而疲惫。“早上好。”美里终于说道。

He offers a small smile and steps inside the car, "Good morning." The car is still running, but she doesn't press on the gas right away after he fastens his seatbelt. She still has that thousand yard stare about her. "Long day?"  
他微微一笑，踏入车内，“早上好。”车子仍在运转，但他在系好安全带后，她并未立即踩下油门。她的眼神依旧空洞而遥远。“昨天很漫长吗？”

Misato shakes her head and presses on the pedal. "You have no idea."  
美里摇了摇头，踩下油门。“你根本想象不到。”

Shinji shifts in his seat. "Do you want to talk about it?"  
真嗣在座位上挪了挪。“你想谈谈吗？”

She surveys the road, "...Not really." There's an awkward silence. "What changed your mind?"  
她环顾道路，"...并不完全是。"一阵尴尬的沉默。"是什么改变了你的主意？"

"O-oh. Well…" "哦-哦。嗯…"

"It wasn't because you didn't want to disappoint, right? If that's the case, I don't know if there's much of a point-"  
"不是因为你不想让人失望，对吧？如果是那样的话，我不确定这还有什么意义-"

"No... well. I mean-" Misato gives him a once over. "There's somebody I need to protect."  
"不...呃，我是说——" 美里上下打量了他一番。"有个人我需要保护。"

This somewhat softens her from her malaise, "Who?" She squints coyly, "Is it a girl?  
这让她从忧郁中稍稍缓和，"谁？" 她狡黠地眯起眼睛，"是个女孩吗？

A damsel in distress?" 一位陷入困境的少女？

"No! No. I mean, y'know. Everybody." He looks at his feet. "Humanity."  
“不！不是。我是说，你知道的。所有人。”他看着自己的脚。“人类。”

Misato nods slowly, somewhat disappointed. "Saving the world, and all that?" He grunts in affirmation. She sighs, "I guess that's a fair reason."  
美里缓缓点头，略显失望。“拯救世界，以及所有那些？”他咕哝着表示肯定。她叹了口气，“我想这是个合理的理由。”

The uncomfortable silence resumes, Shinji looks up. "So, what happened last night?"  
令人不适的沉默再次降临，真嗣抬起头。“那么，昨晚发生了什么？”

"Hey. Have you eaten yet? How about we try those burgers?" Misato attempts a weak smile, yet Shinji takes it as genuine.  
"嘿，你吃过了吗？要不我们去试试那些汉堡？" 美里尝试露出一个虚弱的微笑，但真嗣却信以为真。

He nods excitingly. "Okay!" She nods, her breath shallow. "What's it like?"  
他兴奋地点头。"好的！" 她点头回应，呼吸浅促。"是什么样的？"

"...Crispy." She makes a sharp turn, startling Shinji as she pulls towards a thrive-thru burger joint. "We gotta make one more pit stop and pick up someone else along the way, so we'll get something for her too."  
"...酥脆的。" 她突然转弯，吓了真嗣一跳，车子驶向一家繁忙的得来速汉堡店。"我们还得再停一次，顺路接个人，所以也得给她带点什么。"

Shinji lights up, hope in his eyes. "Who? One of the other pilots?"  
真嗣眼中闪烁着希望的光芒。“谁？是其他驾驶员之一吗？”

Misato stops by the drive-thru microphone. "Yeah. One of the pilots."  
美里在得来速麦克风旁停下。“嗯，是其中一位驾驶员。”

---

A massive paper bag rests on Shinji's lap. They slow into a nearby arcade, the neon doors are wide open. He leans in, trying to pick out Rei. "Do you see her?" He asks Misato.  
一个巨大的纸袋放在真嗣的腿上。他们缓缓驶入附近的一家游戏中心，霓虹灯大门敞开着。他探身向前，试图找到绫波。“你看到她了吗？”他问美里。

"Oh, she's in there, somewhere…"  
"哦，她就在里面，某个地方……"

A muffled voice echoes out. "That's my fucking plushie! I won 'em fair and square!"  
一个模糊的声音回荡着。“那是我的该死的毛绒玩具！我赢得光明正大！”

A burly man backs into the door, pulling against a stuffed animal like his life depends on it. The person pulling on the other end is an unnaturally strong girl with her baggy black hoodie pulled over her head. Her stance is wide.  
一个魁梧的男人退到门边，拼命拽着一个毛绒玩具，仿佛他的生命就靠它了。另一头是一个异常强壮的女孩，她穿着宽松的黑色连帽衫，帽子拉得低低的。她的站姿很宽。

Misato covers her face with her palm. "Yep. That's her alright." She looks at Shinji, who is staring with a mix of awe and confusion.  
美里用手掌捂住脸。“没错，就是她。”她看着真嗣，后者正带着敬畏与困惑交织的表情凝视着。

"Bullshit! I saw you screwing around the claw machine!"  
“胡说！我看到你在抓娃娃机那边瞎折腾！”

"I used my wits to win it! Now give-" She twists her body, making the man lose his footing. "-It. Here!" He tumbles over to the ground. She wipes her hands, drops the tickets on top of the crumpled man and prances out of the arcade.  
“我靠智慧赢来的！现在给我——”她扭动身体，让那人失去平衡。“——拿去。给你！”他摔倒在地。她拍了拍手，把票券丢在那蜷缩的人身上，然后得意洋洋地离开了游戏厅。

Misato honks her horn. The girl spots the car and curses to herself. She gets ready to turn the other way but notices Shinji in the passenger seat. She stomps over menacingly to the car. The girl pulls off her hoodie to reveal a messy mop of red hair, which has odd clumps in it. As if glue was stuck to her hair. Shinji's smile drops. There's a white bandage around her left eye.  
美里按响了喇叭。女孩发现了这辆车，暗自咒骂了一声。她正准备转身离开，却注意到真嗣坐在副驾驶座上。她气势汹汹地朝车子走来。女孩脱下连帽衫，露出一头乱糟糟的红发，上面还有奇怪的结块，仿佛粘了胶水似的。真嗣的笑容消失了。她的左眼上缠着一圈白色绷带。

Along with the yellow dress underneath her hoodie (An odd choice considering the morning heat) and the mismatched socks, she gives off the impression of someone who wasn't taught how to dress herself properly.  
她连帽衫下穿着一条黄色裙子（考虑到早上的炎热，这真是个奇怪的选择），还有不搭配的袜子，给人一种似乎没人教过她如何正确穿衣的印象。

She stops in front of the car and stamps her foot. She glares at Shinji, who is blushing furiously.  
她停在车前，跺了跺脚。她瞪着真嗣，后者脸红得厉害。

There's a tense silence before Shinji clears his throat. "I uh… got you some chicken nuggets." He offers the paper bag and smiles innocently.  
一阵紧张的沉默后，真嗣清了清嗓子。“呃……我给你带了些鸡块。”他递过纸袋，露出无辜的微笑。

The girl glances at Misato, then back at Shinji. She snatches the bag from his hand. "You're in my seat, Numbnuts." She growls.  
女孩瞥了美里一眼，又看向真嗣。她从他手中夺过袋子。“你坐了我的位置，傻瓜。”她咆哮道。

"Oh, sorry!" Shinji tosses his bag over his shoulder and scrambles into the backseat. She slumps into the passenger seat and crosses her arms. Misato stares at her, which she ignores. Shinji clears his throat. "I-I-I'm Shinji. The new pilot!" He offers his hand.  
“哦，对不起！”真嗣把包甩到肩后，慌忙爬进后座。她瘫坐在副驾驶座上，双臂交叉。美里盯着她看，她却视而不见。真嗣再次清了清嗓子。“我……我是真嗣。新来的驾驶员！”他伸出手。

She gives the hand a backwards glance before turning away from it. "Congratulations." He drops the hand.  
她回头瞥了一眼那只手，随即转身离开。“恭喜。”他松开了手。

Misato frowns, "Where are your manners?"  
美里皱眉，“你的礼貌呢？”

"Guess someone forgot to teach me." She turns and stares at Misato, who bites back a retort.  
“猜是有人忘了教我。”她转过身，盯着美里，后者咬紧牙关忍住了反驳。

Misato turns back to Shinji, "Don't mind her. It's been a rough day." The girl rummages through the bag and eats a handful of the chicken nuggets. "Shinji, this is Asuka. Asuka Langley S-"  
美里转向真嗣，“别在意她。今天挺不容易的。”女孩在包里翻找，抓起一把鸡块吃了起来。“真嗣，这是明日香。明日香·兰格雷·S-”

"Charmed, huh?" Asuka says, she smacks loudly on the food and leans into Misato's ear.  
“被迷住了，嗯？”明日香说道，她大声地嚼着食物，凑近美里的耳朵。

Shinji smiles, "Asuka." he raises his hand again. The word leaves a buzz inside of his stomach. "It's nice to meet you."  
真嗣微笑着，“明日香。”他再次举起手。这个词在他胃里留下一阵颤动。“很高兴见到你。”

Asuka looks over at Misato, who nods in approval. She grabs the hand with vice grip and shakes violently. "Hnn."  
明日香瞥向美里，后者点头表示赞许。她紧紧抓住对方的手，用力摇晃。“哼。”

---

The drive over to the Geofront is quiet, the only sounds to be heard are the chewing of food and meager attempts at small talk, which Asuka quickly shuts down with biting remarks.  
前往地底都市的途中一片寂静，唯一能听到的声音是咀嚼食物和勉强进行的闲聊，明日香迅速用尖锐的言辞将其打断。

Shinji chews politely on his Mozzarella Burger. "Mhmm! Really good, Ms. Misato."  
真嗣礼貌地咀嚼着他的马苏里拉芝士汉堡。“嗯！真的很好吃，美里小姐。”

Misato beams, looking like a chipmunk with her own burger, her dour mood somewhat forgotten. "I know, right?"  
美里笑得像只捧着自己汉堡的松鼠，阴郁的心情似乎有所缓解。“我知道，对吧？”

Asuka looks at her empty box and turns around, staring at Shinji's burger. "Lemme have a bite."  
明日香看着自己空空如也的盒子，转过身盯着真嗣的汉堡。“让我咬一口。”

Shinji looks at his half eaten burger and hesitates. He offers it to her so she bite a piece off. His heart flutters as she reaches in…  
真嗣看着自己吃了一半的汉堡，犹豫了一下。他递给她，让她咬了一口。当她伸手去拿时，他的心跳加速了……

She rips off a massive chunk with her hand and stuffs it in her face, leaving Shinji with only a small morsel in between his index and thumb. She mimics Shinji mockingly. "Mhmm! Really good, 'Miss Misato'!"  
她用手撕下一大块，塞进嘴里，只留给真嗣一小块夹在食指和拇指之间。她模仿着真嗣，嘲弄地说：“嗯哼！真的很好吃，‘Misato 小姐’！”

Misato shakes her head. "You shouldn't have snuck off like that. We were really worried, y'know."  
美里摇了摇头。“你不该那样偷偷溜走的。我们真的很担心，你知道的。”

"You? Total shocker." Asuka scoffs. "Thought you'd be too drunk to drive by now."  
“你？真是出乎意料。”明日香嗤之以鼻。“我还以为你现在已经醉到开不了车了呢。”

Misato pinches the bridge of her nose and sighs.  
美里捏了捏鼻梁，叹了口气。

Shinji chuckles nervously, "Sounds like you guys have some history." Neither of them respond, both looking away to their respective windows in sync. "Okay then…" The silence changes from tense, to unbearable. Like any sudden movement would cause an explosion. He laughs again, hoping to break the atmosphere.  
真嗣紧张地笑了笑，"听起来你们之间有些过往。"两人都没有回应，同步地各自望向窗外。"好吧……"沉默从紧张变成了难以忍受，仿佛任何突然的动作都会引发爆炸。他又笑了笑，希望能打破这种氛围。

…

He shifts in his seat uncomfortably. He looks at the empty paper bag. "You guys think we should've gotten something for the other pilot? A-ayanami, I mean."  
他不安地在座位上挪动了一下。他看向空荡荡的纸袋。"你们觉得我们应该给另一位驾驶员带点什么吗？我是说绫波。"

Asuka throws her head back, "Ha!"  
明日香猛地仰头，“哈！”

"Asuka!" Misato warns scoldingly. "You shouldn't make jokes like that. She's still recovering."  
“明日香！”美里严厉地警告道，“你不该开这种玩笑。她还在恢复中。”

"What?" She points to the boy in the backseat. "He's just got good timing, that's all."  
“什么？”她指着后座的男孩，“他只是时机抓得好罢了，仅此而已。”

Shinji leans in closer to the front seats. "What's she talking about?" Misato glances at him in the rear view mirror before shifting her gaze to the left, out to the ocean along the highway. Asuka turns as well. "I don't..."  
真嗣更靠近前排座位。“她在说什么？”美里通过后视镜瞥了他一眼，然后将目光转向左边，望向高速公路旁的大海。明日香也转过头来。“我不……”

Along the shoreline of scattered, flooded skyscrapers, which all bend outwards, the ocean is stained in blood within an epicenter. As if a massacre took place.  
沿着散布着被淹没的摩天大楼的海岸线，这些大楼都向外弯曲，海洋中心区域被血染红。仿佛发生了一场大屠杀。

"What are you, stupid?" “你是不是傻？”

His eyes meet the charred blue giant floating on its back in the crimson sea, helicopters, VTOLS and scientists in orange hazmat suits circle the gargantuan corpse. Like flies completely covering a corpse in the wild. There's two massive holes in the body, one in its throat, the other in its stomach. The splayed open ribcage blends in among the skyscrapers.  
他的目光与那具焦黑的蓝色巨人相遇，它仰面漂浮在血红的海面上，直升机、垂直起降飞机和身着橙色防化服的科学家们围绕着这庞大的遗骸盘旋。宛如野外的苍蝇完全覆盖在尸体上。巨人的身体上有两个巨大的洞，一个在喉咙，另一个在腹部。敞开的肋骨架与周围的摩天大楼融为一体。

Asuka turns to face Shinji, her single eye sunken and face gaunt.  
明日香转向真嗣，她那只深陷的眼睛和憔悴的面容显得格外突出。

"Rei Ayanami's dead." “绫波零已经死了。”

---

Asuka lets out a long groan as she paces back and forth, sloshing tidal waves around her feet in the flooded metropolis. She carries the umbilical cable in one hand in an effort to avoid tangling it in the sunken debris. She holds a silver spear with a spiraling base in the other, which she rests on her shoulder. Far behind her resting on the shoreline, a long stretch of tanks, ready to open fire.  
明日香发出长长的呻吟，来回踱步，在淹没的都市中，她的脚下激起阵阵浪花。她一手拿着脐带电缆，努力避免它缠绕在沉没的残骸上。另一只手则握着一柄银色长矛，矛身呈螺旋状，她将其搭在肩上。在她身后远处的海岸线上，一排排坦克静静地等待着，随时准备开火。

She stretches out the cable. "Stupid Angel." She stabs at the air with her silver, double pronged spear, aiming at imaginary vitale signs as she pivots in place, causing massive sways in the water. "How do you like…" She twirls the bident and leaps in the air, aiming to crash it down in an arc against a toppled down building, with a pirouette to top it off. "-This!?" The sideway building splits in two, dust bursts out of the fissure, coating Unit-02's red paint in grey. As Asuka lands, she skids into a defensive stance, and kicks the spear up horizontally, the point leveled against her lower two eyes.  
她拉长电缆。“愚蠢的天使。”她用那银色的双叉长矛向空中猛刺，对着想象中的生命迹象旋转身体，水面随之剧烈波动。“你觉得……”她旋转着三叉戟，一跃而起，打算以一个旋转动作将它猛击在一座倒塌的建筑上。“-这样如何！？”侧倒的建筑被劈成两半，裂缝中爆发出尘埃，将二号机的红色涂装染成了灰色。明日香落地后，滑步进入防御姿态，将长矛横向踢起，矛尖对准了自己的双眼。

Beside her, Unit-00 stands at attention, a pallet rifle cradled in her hands, her finger resting next to the trigger. She is as still as a statue, a blue sentry practically unseen in the blue reflection of the ocean's surface, naught for her single red eye.  
在她身旁，零号机肃立着，手中托着一把木制步枪，手指轻搭在扳机旁。她静如雕塑，蓝色的身影几乎融入了海面反射的蓝色之中，唯有那只红色的独眼格外显眼。

Asuka continues practicing her moves, grunting with emphasis. "_Pilot Langley, we have not been authorized for horseplay."_ Rei states, she scans the horizon, Asuka scoffs.  
明日香继续练习她的动作，用力地哼了一声。“驾驶员兰格雷，我们未被授权进行嬉戏。”绫波说道，她扫视着地平线，明日香嗤之以鼻。

"_Ooh, that's alright, girls."_ The Commander calls into the intercom. Asuka instantly stands at attention, spear at her side. "_Practice makes perfect!"_  
“哦，没关系，姑娘们。”指挥官通过对讲机喊道。明日香立刻立正，长矛置于身侧。“熟能生巧！”

Rei looks down, "_Copy."_ She turns to look at Asuka. "_You are clear for horseplay, Langley."_  
丽低头说道：“复制。”她转向看着明日香，“你可以尽情嬉戏了，兰格雷。”

Asuka looks down at the ground and leans against one of the warped skyscrapers, resting her elbow in between the two prongs of the spear like it was an umbrella.  
明日香低头看着地面，靠在一座扭曲的摩天大楼上，将肘部搁在两根矛尖之间，仿佛那是一把伞。

The two silent companions stare out at the rising sun, it being only a thin red line ahead of them. Asuka sniffs, "Is it here yet?"  
两位沉默的同伴凝视着冉冉升起的太阳，它在前方仅是一条细长的红线。明日香吸了吸鼻子，问道：“它来了吗？”

Misato's voice chimes in through the feed, "_After Lunar Base confirmed that the Third Angel landed near Mikurajima, diagnostics reads its swim speed as sixty seven miles per hour. At that rate, it'll be another thirty minutes before it reaches it's ambush point."_  
律子的声音通过通讯传来，“月球基地确认第三使徒在御藏岛附近登陆，诊断数据显示其游泳速度为每小时六十七英里。按此速度，它将在三十分钟后到达伏击点。”

Asuka groans loudly and looks at Rei, "Kill me."  
明日香大声呻吟着，看向绫波，“杀了我吧。”

"_Are you ordering me to euthanize you?"_ She asks, "_That would be unwise to do before the sortie is completed."_  
“你是命令我对你实施安乐死吗？”她问道，“在出击任务完成前这么做是不明智的。”

"What? No, that's sarcasm, Ayanami. Sarcasm."  
“什么？不，那是讽刺，绫波。讽刺。”

"_...I see."_ “……我明白了。”

The Commander giggles, "_You girls are so silly."_ Naoko leaves the feed on, as she always does. Instant chatter and jargon buzz in the pilot's ears. "_You can relax."_  
指挥官咯咯笑道，“你们这些女孩真傻。”直子像往常一样让通讯保持开启。飞行员耳边立刻响起了嘈杂的闲聊和术语。“你可以放松了。”

"Yes ma'am." The ocean surface trembles as Asuka slides down the skyscraper and sits, her lower half submerged underneath the shallow depths. She turns to Rei, who remains at attention. "Did you hear her? She said you can relax."  
“是的，女士。” 海面随着明日香从摩天大楼滑下并坐下而微微颤动，她的下半身浸没在浅水中。她转向丽，后者仍保持着警觉。“你听到了吗？她说你可以放松了。”

After a moment of hesitation, Unit-00's shoulders slouch ever so slightly, "_Copy."_  
片刻犹豫后，零号机的肩膀微微下垂，“明白。”

"Ugh…" Unit-02 stabs the spear into the ground and washes the dust off her face, the excess water falling off her hands like rapids. She fishes through the water and retrieves a giant, flat slab of concrete. She winds her arm back and flings it. It skips seven times, causing a gradually decreasing shockwave with each jump. "So… did you do anything interesting lately? Other than stare at your wall all day, I mean."  
“呃……” 二号机将长矛插入地面，洗去脸上的尘土，多余的水从她的手中如急流般落下。她在水中摸索，捞出一块巨大的扁平混凝土板。她向后挥动手臂，猛地一甩。混凝土板跳跃了七次，每次跳跃都引发逐渐减弱的冲击波。“那么……你最近有什么有趣的事吗？除了整天盯着你的墙，我是说。”

Unit-00 tilts her head. "_Are you speaking to me?"_  
零号机歪了歪头。“你在跟我说话吗？”

"No, I'm talking to that pigeon over there." Rei turns her head, Asuka groans, "Yes, I'm talking to you, genius."  
“不，我在跟那边的鸽子说话。”绫波转向一边，明日香叹了口气，“没错，我就是在跟你这个天才说话。”

Rei looks at the rising sun, a thin ray of light reflecting against her single eye. "_I met a boy yesterday."_ From within Unit-02, Asuka perks up. "_We shook hands."_  
绫波望着初升的太阳，一缕微光映在她那只独眼上。“昨天我遇到了一个男孩。”二号机内的明日香顿时来了精神。“我们握了手。”

"Oh God, please tell me you didn't hitch up with one of those new kids at school." Unit-02 scoots closer to the standing blue EVA, creating tidal waves. "Was it Asari or Strasberg?"  
"哦天哪，拜托告诉我你没跟学校里那些新来的孩子勾搭上。" 二号机挪近站立的蓝色 EVA，掀起巨浪。"是阿萨里还是斯特拉斯伯格？"

Rei shakes her head. "_He is a candidate pilot for Unit-01."_  
绫波摇摇头。"他是零一号机的候选驾驶员。"

"Wow, so a new-new kid. What's his name?"  
"哇，那是个全新的新人。他叫什么名字？"

Unit-00 slowly squats down beside Unit-02, "_...Shinji Ikari."_ Passing through the labyrinth of Rei's icy consciousness, the boy's name feels… warm. She looks at Asuka.  
零号机缓缓蹲在二号机旁，"...碇真嗣。"穿越丽冰冷意识的迷宫，男孩的名字感觉……温暖。她看向明日香。

Underneath her EVA, Asuka blinks. She skips another slab of debris at the water. "Shinji…" The two girls turn to look at the horizon. "That's a dumb name."  
在她的 EVA 下，明日香眨了眨眼。她又跳过了一块漂浮的碎片。"真嗣……"两个女孩转向地平线。"那是个傻名字。"

Naoko scowls at the video feed. None of the NERV crew had so much of an hour of sleep, as soon as their shifts were over near midnight, they received word from Lunar Base confirming Sachiel's entry into Earth's atmosphere and were called back to be on standby.  
直子皱眉看着视频画面。NERV 的全体人员连一小时的睡眠都没有，午夜刚过换班时，他们就收到了月球基地确认萨基尔进入地球大气层的通知，并被召回待命。

Four hours in, Naoko had passed along her preparation material. Weapon schematics, a list of potential abilities Sachiel might possess judging from their simulations, a powerpoint breakdown for the crew and pilots all dropped onto Misato's lap, hoping to gain some well earned beauty sleep.  
四个小时过去了，直子已经传来了她的准备资料。武器图纸、根据模拟推测出的萨基尔可能拥有的能力清单，以及为全体船员和驾驶员准备的 PPT 分析，全都堆在了美里的大腿上，她希望能借此机会好好补个觉。

She stares at her watch. Five AM. All sense of giddiness was overpowered by annoyance. They had five hours to wrap this up before her new project arrived in Tokyo-03.  
她盯着腕表，凌晨五点。所有的兴奋感都被烦躁所取代。他们还有五个小时来完成这一切，之后她的新项目就要抵达东京-03 了。

Misato chugs a steaming mug of black coffee and rubs her eyes. Naoko suspects that after her shift was over, she had her routine nightly beer and is still buzzed as they speak.  
美里猛灌了一杯热腾腾的黑咖啡，揉了揉眼睛。直子猜测，她的夜班结束后，照例会喝上一杯啤酒，现在可能还带着微醺。

This time, she'll let it slide.  
这次，她会睁一只眼闭一只眼。

Misato leans into her mic, "Okay kids." With a swipe of her hand, a profile of the Angel appears on the overhead display in the commander centre, as well as the EVA's HUD. "See those lances sticking out of either of it's elbows? They're not fixed firmly in place, so we believe they can travel through the Angel's wrist and can be used to exert energy. It doesn't seem intelligent, when we dropped an N2 mine on it upon entry, it regenerated and ignored our fleet ambush. You're best bet will be to go for its-"  
美里凑近麦克风，"好了，孩子们。"她挥手一划，天使的轮廓便出现在指挥中心的上方显示屏以及 EVA 的头盔显示器上。"看到它肘部伸出的那些长矛了吗？它们固定得并不牢固，所以我们认为它们可以穿过天使的手腕并用于施加能量。它似乎并不聪明，我们投放了一枚 N2 地雷进入时，它再生了并忽视了我们的舰队伏击。你们最好的选择是瞄准它的——"

Naoko chimes in, "Core, yes. Thank you, Misato. Remember girls, Rei will be on point. Asuka you will observe the fight and look for any other weaknesses. As soon as you have the opening, throw the spear right at the core."  
直子插话道，"核心，没错。谢谢你，美里。记住，姑娘们，零将会是先锋。明日香，你要观察战斗并寻找其他弱点。一旦有机会，就把长矛直接投向核心。"

"_Roger."_ Asuka and Rei speak simultaneously.  
"罗杰。" 明日香和绫波同时说道。

"Uh… Commander?" Shigeru Aoba calls out, nervously scratching his head.  
"呃… 指挥官？" 青叶茂紧张地挠着头喊道。

Naoko turns, "Yes, Lieutenant?"  
直子转过身来，"什么事，中尉？"

"Well, ah-" He points at the monitor. "The Angel's gone." He transfers his screen to the main display. "There's a… rainbow where it's position was." He peers at the screen. "A square rainbow."  
“呃，这个——” 他指向显示器。“使徒消失了。”他将屏幕切换到主显示屏。“它的位置上出现了一道……彩虹。”他凝视着屏幕。“一道方形的彩虹。”

Ritsuko shakes her head, "A hexagon. That's an AT field. But where did-" She stares at the screen, a black dot soars through the sky, increasing in size, no. In proximity. "What on earth…" Another AT field projects underneath and it bounces higher up into the sky.  
律子摇了摇头，“是六边形。那是 AT 力场。但它是从哪儿——”她盯着屏幕，一个黑点在空中疾驰，逐渐变大，不，是越来越近。“这究竟是……”又一个 AT 力场在其下方展开，它随之弹射得更高。

Maya gasps, "It's using the AT field as a launching point!"  
玛雅倒吸一口气，“它正利用 AT 力场作为发射点！”

Through the video feed, Rei and Asuka stand up and stare at the flying object. The sound of the Angel leaping off it's AT field echoes like furious chimes in the wind, sending out shockwaves.  
通过视频画面，丽和明日香站起身来，凝视着那飞行物体。使徒跃出其 AT 力场的声音在风中回荡，如同狂怒的风铃，激起阵阵冲击波。

Rei instantly opens fire and charges.  
丽立刻开火并冲锋。

The black blur approaches closer, it's back to the sun.  
那黑色模糊的身影愈发接近，背对着太阳。

Asuka kicks up the spear in a throwing position. "_I got a clear shot!"_  
明日香将长矛举起，摆出投掷的姿势。“我有机会了！”

"Negative, Asuka! Your orders are to be on standby!" Misato barks into the com. Naoko silently watches.  
“不行，明日香！你的命令是待命！”美里对着通讯器厉声说道。直子默默地注视着。

She widens her stance and goes for a running throw. "_Here goes!"_  
她拉开架势，准备助跑投掷。“看我的！”

The spear zooms past Sachiel, grazing it's shoulder. An AT field generates on its feet and the Angel takes another leap.  
长矛疾驰而过，擦过萨奇尔的肩膀。它脚下的 AT 力场生成，天使再次跃起。

"Dammit, Asuka! I told you to stand down!"  
“该死，明日香！我告诉过你撤退！”

"_The sun was in my eye!"_  
“阳光晃到我的眼睛了！”

Misato turns to Kyoko, "Initiate recall!"  
美里转向绫子，"启动召回！"

Kyoko turns to Ritsuko who nods, she enters a command on her keyboard. "Initiating!"  
绫子转向律子，后者点头示意，她在键盘上输入指令。"开始执行！"

Asuka's hand stretches out, the spear freezes in mid air. It slingshots back into her direction and she prepares to catch it. Metres before it reaches her grasp, it halts again, hovering in the air. "_The hell? Ayanami, let it go!"_  
明日香的手伸向前方，长矛在半空中凝固。它如弹弓般回射向她，她准备接住。在即将触及她的几米前，它再次停住，悬浮在空中。"搞什么鬼？绫波，放手！"

"_That is not me."_ Rei protests in between rifle bursts, "_It is-"_  
"那不是我。" 丽在枪声中抗议道，"那是-"

The spear zooms past the two, soaring back to the falling Angel.  
长矛从两人身边疾驰而过，飞回坠落的使徒身边。

With a _thud,_ Sachiel catches it. Its three bony claws wrap tightly around the spiral base as it braces for a landing. "_...What the fu-"_  
随着一声闷响，萨基尔抓住了它。它那三根骨质的爪子紧紧包裹着螺旋形的矛柄，准备着陆。"...搞什么鬼-"

Sachiel crashes into the ocean, causing a massive tidal wave that nearly knocks the two pilots over. Nearby skyscrapers come tumbling down.  
萨基尔坠入海洋，引发了一场巨大的海啸，差点将两名驾驶员掀翻。附近的摩天大楼纷纷倒塌。

The NERV crew stare, speechless. Naoko leans over to Kyoko. She clears her throat. "Did you know it could do that?"  
NERV 的成员们目瞪口呆，无言以对。直子凑近京子，清了清嗓子。“你知道它能做到这种程度吗？”

"...No." "...不。"

She scratches her chin. "Well, that's one more to scratch off the list."  
她挠了挠下巴。“好吧，这下又可以划掉一个了。”

---

"That's so freaking cheap!" Asuka protests. Rei empties her clip at the Angel's core to no effect.  
"这简直太抠门了！" 明日香抗议道。绫波则向使徒的核心倾泻弹药，却毫无效果。

Sachiel slowly looks up, its circular, owl shaped mask made of bone projects a bottomless rage.  
萨基尔缓缓抬头，它那圆形、形似猫头鹰的面具由骨头构成，透出无尽的愤怒。

"_Neither of you move,"_ Misato warns, "_As soon as he prepares to throw, dodge it and charge in before it can recall the spear."_  
"你们俩都别动，" 美里警告说，"一旦它准备投掷，立刻闪避并趁它来不及收回长矛前冲上去。

Asuka cracks her neck, Rei pulls out her prog knife. "_Not yet…"_ Sachiel pivots, he aims… "_Now!"_  
明日香扭了扭脖子，绫波则拔出了她的程序刀。“还没……”萨基尔转身，它瞄准……“就是现在！”

Right as the spear flies in their direction, the two EVA's somersault to either side and break into a sprint. With a _whoosh_, the silver spear zooms right past their ears.  
就在长矛朝他们飞来的瞬间，两台 EVA 分别翻滚向两侧，随即加速冲刺。银色长矛呼啸而过，正好擦过他们的耳边。

Rei jabs her knife in front of Sachiel to get its attention while Asuka slides behind the Angel in an attempt to sweep its leg.  
绫波用刀尖刺向萨基尔以吸引其注意，而明日香则滑到天使身后，试图扫倒它的腿。

The Angel effortlessly dodges both attacks and grabs their heads with either hand, lifting with tremendous strength as it's arms inflate. It's elbow lances shimmer into a purple light as they travel through Sachiel's wrists, impacting the base of their skulls while they hang limply in place.  
天使轻松地躲开了两次攻击，用双手抓住它们的头部，以惊人的力量将其举起，手臂随之膨胀。它的肘部尖刺闪烁着紫色光芒，穿过萨奇尔的手腕，击中它们悬挂无力的头骨底部。

"_Now!"_ Naoko shouts, "_Full barrage!"_ The tanks lined up along the shore open fire, a volley of flame traveling to the three fighters.  
“现在！”直子大喊，“全力齐射！”沿岸排列的坦克开火，一排火焰弹射向三名战士。

"_Wait, we can't just-"_ Misato protests.  
“等等，我们不能就这样——”美里抗议道。

"_They'll be fine."_  “他们会没事的。”

Upon contact, Sachiel and the EVA pilots disappear in the giant cloud of smoke. Oily fire rests on the surface of the ocean. The smoke clears to reveal Rei and Asuka holding back either of it's arms, its lances pointed away from them. Rei reaches with her free hand and wildly stabs at Sachiel's core with her prog knife.  
接触之际，萨基尔与 EVA 驾驶员们消失在巨大的烟雾中。海面上燃烧着油火。烟雾散去，只见绫波零和明日香各自制住其手臂，长矛指向远离她们的方向。绫波用空着的手疯狂地用推进刀刺向萨基尔的核心。

Another flat AT field projects and Sachiel takes to the sky. The girls look above at the suspended Angel.  
又一圈平坦的 AT 力场展开，萨基尔腾空而起。两位少女抬头望向悬浮的天使。

It's hollow eyes glow red.  
它那空洞的双眼泛着红光。

---

"My god…" Fuyutsuki whispers.  
“我的天啊……”冬月低声说道。

A pillar of light appears where Unit-02 and 00 were standing, ending with cross guards on the top. Rei and Asuka are launched into the air before dropping back down.  
在二号机和零号机原本站立的地方，一道光柱冲天而起，顶端呈十字形。绫波和明日香被抛向空中，随后又坠落下来。

They stumble, leaning on each other to get their bearings. Another cross beam, the girls fly into the air again. Rei lands on her feet this time and Asuka crashes into a skyscraper.  
他们踉跄着，互相依靠以稳住身形。又一根横梁，女孩们再次飞向空中。这次丽稳稳落地，而明日香则撞进了一座摩天大楼。

Fuyutsuki turns to Naoko. "We need to abort, Commander. Have the pilots evacuate and call in another N2 mine."  
冬月转向直子。“我们必须中止，指挥官。让驾驶员撤离，并呼叫另一枚 N2 地雷。”

Naoko shakes her head woefully, "I wish I could, Kozo. But an N2 mine would simply be ineffective."  
直子悲伤地摇了摇头，“我真希望可以，高雄。但 N2 地雷根本无效。”

"And expensive." Kyoko adds.  
“还很贵。”Kyoko 补充道。

Misato's jaw drops. "That's your daughter you're talking about!" Kyoko's eye twitches. "We have to do something."  
美里下巴都快掉下来了。“你说的可是你自己的女儿！”恭子眼角抽搐。“我们必须做点什么。”

"I'm afraid Kyoko's right, Misato. We must have faith in our girls."  
“恐怕恭子说得对，美里。我们必须对我们的女孩们有信心。”

---

Rei runs up to a collapsed Asuka, both of their umbilical cables are severed, the five minute timer ticking. She offers her hand. "_Are you alright?"_  
绫波跑向倒地的明日香，两人的脐带电缆都已被切断，五分钟倒计时滴滴作响。她伸出手。“你还好吗？”

Asuka bats the hand away. Rei reaches to lift her up, "Get off me!" She shouts, standing up on her own. The two look up at the free falling Angel, "How the hell do we kill this thing?"  
明日香拍开那只手。丽伸手想扶她起来，“别碰我！”她喊道，自己站了起来。两人抬头看向自由落体的使徒，“我们到底该怎么干掉这玩意儿？”

"_Commander!"_ Ritsuko calls out, "_The Angel recalled the spear again!"_  
“司令！”律子喊道，“使徒再次召回了长枪！”

The spear flies into Sachiels grip. Gaining momentum, it spins in the air and tosses it right at Asuka.  
长枪飞入萨基尔的手中。它加速旋转，在空中猛地掷向明日香。

Asuka extends her arm and narrows her brow in concentration. A light shimmers in front of her. "_AT field, full power!"_ A hexagonal shield appears in front of her. It halts the spear, jammed halfway through the field.  
明日香伸出手臂，眉头紧锁，全神贯注。一束光芒在她面前闪烁。“AT 力场，全力展开！”一个六边形护盾出现在她前方。它挡住了长矛，使其卡在力场中间无法前进。

The replicant spear begins to spin in place, emitting steam. Asuka gasps. The AT field shatters. It's aimed right at her eye.  
复制体长矛开始原地旋转，冒出蒸汽。明日香倒吸一口凉气。AT 力场破碎了。长矛直指她的眼睛。

Rei shoves her out of the way. Asuka rolls to the side, colliding into another ruined building. "_Asuka-"_ The spear penetrates Rei's chest cavity.  
绫波零将她推开。明日香滚向一旁，撞进另一座废墟建筑。“明日香——”长矛穿透了绫波的胸腔。

Asuka shakes her head and looks up to see Rei impaled against a skyscraper, her body convulsing.  
明日香摇了摇头，抬头望去，只见丽被钉在一座摩天大楼上，身体抽搐着。

"_Unit-00's entry plug is compromised! Wounds to the pilots abdominal area-"_  
「零号机的插入栓受损！驾驶员腹部受创——」

"No-no-no-no-" Asuka sprints across the city block to reach Rei. Sachiel lands on the ground and raises its claw, its eyes glowing again. Asuka gasps and somersaults to avoid the cross beam. She narrowly dodges it, but it sends her flying into Rei. Asuka lands on her feet, skidding towards Rei as she lunges for the spear and attempts to pull it out of her.  
「不——不——不——不——」明日香在街区中疾奔，试图接近丽。萨基尔落地后举起爪子，双眼再次亮起。明日香倒吸一口气，翻滚躲避交叉光束。她险险避开，但仍被击飞撞向丽。明日香稳稳落地，滑向丽的同时扑向长矛，试图将其拔出。

Rei lets out a muffled scream from her entry plug. "_Asuka, wait!"_ Misato calls out, "_The spear grazed her torso, if you dislodge the spear, she'll bleed out!"_  
丽在插入栓内发出一声闷哼。“明日香，等等！”美里喊道，“长矛擦过了她的躯干，如果你拔出长矛，她会失血过多！”

Asuka gasps and lets go instantly, "Fuck!" She turns to Sachiel, who is marching slowly towards her. She snarls.  
明日香倒吸一口气，立刻松手，“该死！”她转向正缓缓向她逼近的萨基尔，怒目而视。

She deploys her two prog knives and charges at the Angel. She lunges low for a feint, which it falls for. Asuka sidesteps and ducks underneath Sachiel's arm and stabs, one knife hitting its armpit, the other slightly denting Sachiel's core.  
她展开两把推进刀，向使徒冲去。她低身虚晃一招，使徒上当。明日香侧身闪避，从萨基尔的臂下钻过，一刀刺中其腋下，另一刀则略微凹陷在萨基尔的核心上。

She attempts to tug the knives out to no avail, Sachiel looks down at her and grabs both of Unit-02's arms. The Angel's arms inflate. It squeezes.  
她试图拔出刀刃，却徒劳无功，萨基尔低头看着她，抓住了二号机的双臂。天使的手臂膨胀起来。它挤压着。

Both humerus' snap with a sickening _crunch._ Asuka writhes for a moment before the pain registers, she lets out an agonizing shriek.  
两根肱骨应声而断，发出令人作呕的碎裂声。明日香挣扎了一会儿，疼痛才袭上心头，她发出一声痛苦的尖叫。

Sachiel lifts her in the air, her arms bent in a horrific angle as she dangles, kicking her legs. The Angel spins twice before letting go. Asuka floats in the air briefly before slamming against two buildings and crumbles underneath a mound of rubble. _Move. Move, you stupid brat._ She attempts to prop herself up, but her arms bend the other way. Asuka lands on her face.  
萨基尔将她举到空中，她的手臂以骇人的角度扭曲着，双腿乱蹬。天使旋转了两圈后松手。明日香在空中短暂悬浮，随后猛地撞上两栋建筑，被废墟掩埋。动啊。动啊，你这个笨蛋。她试图撑起自己，但双臂却反向弯曲。明日香脸朝下摔倒在地。

She locks eyes with Sachiel before the Angel turns around, giving her a backside glance as it walks towards the Geofront.  
她与萨基尔对视一眼，随后天使转身离去，留给她的只是一个背影，朝着 Geofront 走去。

"_Commander. Orders?"_ Misato states. Naoko doesn't respond. "_Commander!"_  
"指挥官。命令？" 美里说道。直子没有回应。"指挥官！"

"_Give her a minute."_  "给她一点时间。"

Asuka blinks, her vision doubled. Rei regains consciousness and slowly pries the spear out of the building with her feet. The double pronged spearhead remains in her chest. Landing back on the ground, Rei stumbles and falls on one knee. "Stay down." Asuka whimpers as she struggles to get up. "Please, just stay down."  
明日香眨了眨眼，视线变得模糊。绫波零恢复意识，用脚慢慢将长矛从建筑物中拔出。双叉矛头仍嵌在她的胸口。落地后，绫波踉跄了一下，单膝跪地。“别起来了。”明日香哽咽着，挣扎着想要起身。“求你了，就待在那儿别动。”

Misato's voice begins to take form. "_Rei, the mission is a failure. Fall back with Asuka to the Geofront."_ Rei shakes her head and stands up, her body swaying. "_Rei. Fall. Back. Now."_ She grabs the base of the spear and snaps it in half with a shout. "_Rei!"_ The prong still impaled in her chest  
美里的话语开始变得清晰。“绫波，任务失败了。和明日香一起撤退到地底都市。”绫波摇了摇头，站起身来，身体摇晃。“绫波，撤退。现在。”她抓住矛的底部，大喊一声将其折断。“绫波！”矛尖仍插在她的胸口

Asuka's vision focuses back into one. Rei chucks the bottom part of the spear at Sachiel which hits the back of his head.  
明日香的视线重新聚焦。绫波将长矛的下半部分扔向萨基尔，击中了他的后脑勺。

It slowly turns back to her, it's mask has fallen off, revealing nothing behind it. A new carapace grows in its place. It's eyes glow red as he lifts both hands.  
它缓缓转回她，面具已脱落，背后空无一物。新的甲壳在其位置上生长。它的双眼泛着红光，他举起双手。

Rei turns to Asuka. They lock eyes.  
丽转向明日香。她们目光交汇。

Asuka hobbles into a sprint, trying to tackle Rei out of the blast zone. A barrage of crossbeams knocks her back. She looks up to see Rei flying limply in the air by the continuous blasts, like a ragdoll. The explosions stop. Rei hovers briefly before plummeting.  
明日香一瘸一拐地冲向丽，试图将她撞出爆炸区域。一连串的横梁将她击退。她抬头望去，只见丽像布偶一样被连续的炮火击中，无力地在空中飘荡。爆炸停止了。丽短暂悬浮后急速坠落。

Unit-00 lands on its back, lifeless. "_Pilot's pulse has flatlined!"_ Ristuko shouts. "_Advise immediate-"_  
零号机背部着地，毫无生气。“驾驶员心跳已停止！”理津子大喊，“建议立即——”

"_Belay that. She's fine."_ Naoko says casually.  
“取消那个命令。她没事。”直子随意地说道。

"_How can you say that!"_ Misato shouts, "_Look at the-"_  
“你怎么能这么说！”美里喊道，“看看——”

"_Captain Katsuragi."_ Kyoko says coolly. "_I assure you, by the end of this you will find Rei Ayanami unsca-"_  
"葛城队长。" 绫波零冷静地说道。"我保证，到这一切结束时，你会发现碇真嗣毫发无损-"

Asuka's ears ring. She collapses on her knees as she stares at Rei's floating corpse, half swallowed by the ocean. Sachiel marches towards her slowly, it's head tilted to the side. She attempts to clutch her head with her limp arms, they flop backwards. Her bent back elbows dig at her temple.  
明日香的耳朵嗡嗡作响。她跪倒在地，凝视着被海水半吞噬的绫波零的浮尸。萨基尔缓缓向她逼近，头歪向一边。她试图用无力的双臂抱住头，手臂却软绵绵地向后垂下。弯曲的肘部压在她的太阳穴上。

Not again… 不要再来了…

The sudden sensation of a vice grip muzzle tightening across her face nags at her mind. Her jaws beg to break free.  
突如其来的铁钳般紧箍的口鼻压迫感在她脑海中挥之不去。她的下颚渴望挣脱束缚。

---

The NERV crew watch helplessly as Sachiel makes it's advance towards Asuka, it's red eyes charging for a final attack. Naoko watches patiently, her hands resting on her lap.  
NERV 的队员们无助地看着萨基尔向明日香逼近，它那红色的眼睛蓄势待发，准备发动最后的攻击。直子静静地观察着，双手放在膝上。

"Asuka, please." Maya gasps into her mic, "Please, just run away." Ritsuko whispers something indistinct into Naoko's ear, to which she shakes her head.  
“明日香，求你了。”真希对着麦克风喘息道，“求你，快逃吧。”律子在直子耳边低语了几句，她却只是摇了摇头。

Misato breathes deeply and walks away from the command center. The Commander glances at her. "Where are you going?"  
美里深呼吸后，离开了指挥中心。司令官瞥了她一眼。“你要去哪儿？”

"I'm getting Shinji." She states calmly.  
“我去接真嗣。”她平静地说道。

Fuyutsuki nods in approval, "I'm going with you."  
副司令点头表示同意，“我跟你一起去。”

"That won't be necessary." Naoko responds, equally calm. "Asuka has the situation under control."  
"那就不必了。"直子同样平静地回应，"明日香能应付得来。"

Misato points to the doubled over Unit-02, clutching her head, rocking back and forth."You call _this_ under control?" She shakes her head, "I don't care if he's not ready. I'm not letting Asuka die." Misato glares at Kyoko, who is silently watching the screen, hands behind her back. Brow furrowed. "Will you?"  
美里指向蜷缩成一团的二号机，双手抱头，前后摇晃。"你管这叫控制住了？"她摇摇头，"我不在乎他是否准备好了。我不会让明日香死的。"美里瞪着静静观察屏幕、双手背在身后的绫子，眉头紧锁。"你会吗？"

"_-Kill you."_  "-杀了你。"

The entire room freezes in place, slowly turning to HUD, "_I'll kill you."_ Echoes throughout NERV headquarters.  
整个房间瞬间凝固，众人缓缓转向 HUD，“我要杀了你。”这句回声在 NERV 总部内回荡。

Unit-02's rocking back and forth intensifies. "_-I'll kill you, I'll kill you-"_  
二号机的摇摆愈发剧烈。“我要杀了你，我要杀了你——”

The cross beam emerges from below her feet, larger than the others. She disappears in the blinding red light. The force of the blast is so powerful, it separates the surrounding water from the ocean floor, sending it to the sky in a shower that smolders the accompanying flames.  
从她脚下升起的横梁比其他的都要大。她在刺眼的红色光芒中消失。爆炸的威力如此强大，以至于将周围的水与海底分离，化作一场炽热的雨幕冲天而起，扑灭了随之而来的火焰。

Misato leans onto a nearby desk for support as her heart sinks. She covers her mouth with her hand, "Sweetheart…" She whimpers softly. Kyoko watches her wordlessly and she hangs her head.  
美里靠在附近的桌子上支撑着自己，心沉了下去。她用手捂住嘴，轻声呜咽着：“亲爱的……”绫子默默地看着她，低下了头。

Underneath the dense haze of smoke, four green eyes glow furiously.  
在浓密的烟雾之下，四只绿色的眼睛愤怒地闪烁着。

"_-Kill you, I'll kill you, I'll kill you-"_ The voice hissed repeatedly, as though coming from Unit 02 itself.  
“-杀了你，我要杀了你，我要杀了你-”那个声音反复低语，仿佛来自二号机本身。

She emerges from the smoke, her body twitching violently. Some of the armour is peeled off, revealing a tan layer underneath. Her arms clench and with a vile cracking sound, they realign back into place. "_-Kill you, I'll kill you, I'll kill you-I'll kill you-"_  
她从烟雾中现身，身体剧烈抽搐。部分盔甲剥落，露出底下晒黑的肌肤。她的双臂紧握，伴随着一声恶心的断裂声，重新对齐归位。“-我要杀了你，我要杀了你，我要杀了你-我要杀了你-”

"Arms are fully operational!" Maya calls out.  
“手臂完全正常！”玛雅喊道。

From the feed, Sachiel observes the encroaching red monstrosity. It cocks its head to the side and extends its arm, yet it's eyes do not glow.  
从画面中，萨奇尔观察着逼近的红色怪物。它歪着头，伸出一只手臂，但它的眼睛并未发光。

Unit-00's floating remains spasm, the spear hand yanks out of her chest and soars towards Sachiel's grip.  
零号机的残骸抽搐着悬浮，长矛般的手从她胸口猛地拔出，直奔萨基尔的掌握。

Unit-02's hand catches it midway. Asuka's head thrashes manically, "_I'LL KILL YOU."_  
二号机中途截住了它。明日香的头疯狂地摇摆，“我要杀了你。”

"She's going berserk!" “她要发狂了！”

Bolts hiss and fly out of Unit-02's jaw. With anguished wail, she brandishes a set of fanged, jagged teeth hidden behind a metal frame.  
螺栓从二号机的颚部嘶嘶作响地飞出。伴随着痛苦的哀嚎，她挥舞着一组隐藏在金属框架后的尖锐利齿。

Sachiel continues it's attempt to call the spear back itself, dragging Asuka's feet. She gives into the pulling force and charges the Angel.  
萨基尔继续试图自行召回长矛，拖拽着明日香的脚步。她顺应这股拉力，向使徒冲去。

Misato stares, her eyes wide with horror, "Asuka…"  
美里凝视着，眼中满是惊恐，“明日香……”

Naoko conceals a smirk, "There she is." She says, unheard.  
直子掩藏不住一丝窃笑，“她来了。”她低声说道，无人听见。

Sachiels eyes glow, summoning another cross beam. Asuka sprints through the explosion and it flinches. She tackles the Angel to the ground.  
萨基尔的双眼闪烁着光芒，召唤出另一道十字光束。明日香穿梭于爆炸之中，那光束微微颤动。她猛地将天使扑倒在地。

Asuka pins the Angels wrists with her knees, it flails wildly, legs kicking the air. She stabs at the core, creating a crack in the red orb. She stabs again, and again, and again. On the fifth hit, it pierces through the core, and one of the prongs break off.  
明日香用膝盖压住天使的手腕，它疯狂地挣扎，双腿在空中乱踢。她一次次刺向核心，红色的球体上裂开了一道缝隙。她再次刺入，一次又一次。第五次击中时，她穿透了核心，叉尖断裂了一根。

Her fingers dig into the cracking orb as she ferally pants, like a hungry dog.  
她的手指紧紧扣入那裂纹斑斑的球体，野性地喘息着，宛如一头饥渴的野狗。

Sachiels form becomes elastic, wiggling itself from Asuka's grasp and wrapping around her face. The red core begins to glow. "It's attempting to self-destruct!" Ristuko calls out.  
萨奇尔的形态变得弹性十足，从明日香的手中扭动逃脱，缠绕在她的脸上。红色的核心开始发光。“它正试图自毁！”理津子大声警告。

Before Naoko can respond, Kyoko pushes on the intercom, "Langley, contain your AT field!"  
直子还没来得及回应，京子便按下了对讲机，“兰格雷，控制你的 AT 力场！”

Asuka obeys instantaneously, a shimmering light blankets her. "No!" Misato yells out.  
明日香立刻服从，一道闪烁的光芒笼罩了她。“不！”美里大喊道。

She implodes. 她崩解了。

"_We could go to America together. W-we can bring the EVA with us too. I'll practice extra hard every day, I promise…"_  
“我们可以一起去美国。我们还可以带上 EVA。我每天都会加倍努力练习，我保证……”

_The two adults gently pat her head. "Sorry, sweetheart. This isn't a job for kids. We'll come back for you soon. I swear. Ms. Akagi will look after you until then."  
两位大人轻轻拍了拍她的头。“对不起，亲爱的。这不是小孩子该做的事。我们很快就会回来接你。我发誓。赤木女士会在这之前照顾你的。”_

_The little girl sniffles, "I hate her…"  
小女孩抽泣着，“我讨厌她……”_

---

The lights within the cockpit flicker back to life, Asuka shakes her head, "How long was I out?"  
驾驶舱内的灯光闪烁着重新亮起，明日香摇了摇头，“我昏迷了多久？”

Asuka wades through the ocean of blood and smoke, stumbling with each step. Near the intact, untouched city a swarm of helicopters and VTOL's approach. She turns to the ruins that she resides in. Other than its blood staining the once blue, murky, flooded city, there is no sign of the Angel's corpse. The sharps of the silver spear have sunken to the ocean bed.  
明日香蹚过血海与硝烟，每一步都踉踉跄跄。在完好无损、未受波及的城市附近，一群直升机和垂直起降飞机正逼近。她转身望向自己栖身的废墟。除了染红了曾经蔚蓝、如今浑浊积水的城市，天使的尸体已无迹可寻。那银色长矛的尖端已沉入海底。

Her eyes lead to the floating, charred remains of Unit-00, it's rib cage split open from the spear being pulled from her chest. The core is still intact.  
她的目光落在飘浮着的、被烧焦的零号机残骸上，其胸腔因长矛从胸口拔出而裂开。核心依然完好无损。

Asuka falls to her knees, her upper body engulfed in the pool of blood. "Rei…"  
明日香跪倒在地，上半身被血泊吞没。“丽……”

She hangs her head, a part of Unit-02's frontal face plate falls off, briefly floating on the surface before sinking down. Asuka touches her face, the tan layer of skin is noseless and without eyes.  
她垂下头，二号机的前额装甲板脱落了一块，短暂地漂浮在水面上，随后沉了下去。明日香触摸着自己的脸，那层棕褐色的皮肤没有鼻子，也没有眼睛。

Asuka feels something shift in her skull, four orbs battle to break through the skin. The skin cracks against the bulges, they peel open…  
明日香感觉到颅内有什么在移动，四颗眼球挣扎着要冲破皮肤。皮肤在凸起处裂开，它们剥落开来……

And in the crimson reflection, four yellow eyes gaze back at her, blinking.  
而在那片血红的倒影中，四只黄色的眼睛回望着她，眨动着。

---

Asuka gasps a breath of sterile air. She surveys her surroundings, she's in a hospital.  
明日香深吸了一口无菌空气。她环顾四周，发现自己身处医院。

She peels off an oxygen mask and pulls out the IV attached to her wrist.  
她摘下氧气面罩，拔掉了手腕上的静脉注射针。

She stares at the ceiling, "...Another-"  
她凝视着天花板，"...又一次-"

"Unfamiliar ceiling?" A shrill voice calls out. Asuka cringes, "Yes, you are fond of saying that." Asuka turns to her right to see Naoko sitting in a chair next to her. She has a romance novel in her lap.  
“陌生的天花板？”一个尖锐的声音响起。明日香皱眉，“是的，你总爱这么说。”明日香转向右边，看到直子坐在她旁边的椅子上，膝上放着一本言情小说。

Naoko crosses her legs and smiles at her. Asuka touches the bandage wrapped around her eye. "Oh, that? You had an orbital fracture, banged your head quite badly during the fight. You are always safe in the entry plug, but when you're thrashed around like you were, I suppose you would just be… oh, what's the right word?" She taps her chin, "A pickle in a jar."  
直子交叉双腿，对她微笑。明日香触摸着缠绕在眼睛上的绷带。“哦，那个？你眼眶骨折了，战斗中头部撞得很严重。你总是在插入栓里很安全，但当你像那样被甩来甩去时，我想你只会是……哦，正确的词是什么？”她轻敲下巴，“罐子里的腌黄瓜。”

Asuka winces upon touching her eyebrow. "Oh…" Naoko coos, she reaches to gently stroke her cheek affectionately. "You poor thing." Asuka is paralyzed by the touch, only able to move after Naoko removes her finger. "I wouldn't take off that bandage if I were you."  
明日香摸到眉毛时疼得皱眉。“哦……”直子轻声安慰，她伸手温柔地抚摸她的脸颊。“可怜的孩子。”明日香被这触碰定住了，直到直子移开手指才能动弹。“如果我是你，我不会拆掉那个绷带。”

"...How long was I out?"  
“...我昏迷了多久？”

"Only two hours," Naoko sighs, "That was quite a mess. Thankfully, it all worked out." She nods to herself.  
“只有两个小时，”直子叹了口气，“那真是一团糟。幸好，一切都解决了。”她自顾自地点了点头。

Asuka feels a surge of bravery, "What about Ayanami? Did it work out for her?"  
明日香感到一股勇气涌上心头，“那绫波呢？她的情况如何？”

Naoko clicks her tongue. "Rei? Oh, she's fine. Her wounds healed up rather quickly. There's hardly a scratch on her."  
直子咂了咂舌。“丽？哦，她没事。她的伤好得相当快。几乎看不出痕迹。”

Asuka turns to look away from her gaze, "I don't believe you." Naoko sits up from her seat and she flinches involuntarily.  
明日香转过头避开她的目光，“我不信。”直子从座位上坐直，不由自主地缩了一下。

"You don't? Why wouldn't you? You've seen it before, she's a tough girl." She says, hands held together. Asuka doesn't respond. She sighs, "Rei, dear? Would you come in here, please?"  
“你不信？为什么不信？你以前见过的，她是个坚强的女孩。”她说着，双手合十。明日香没有回应。她叹了口气，“丽，亲爱的？请你进来一下好吗？”

Asuka breathes heavily as Rei Ayanami walks through the hospital door, a blank stare on her face. She approaches Naoko, "Yes?"  
明日香呼吸沉重，看着绫波零穿过医院大门，脸上毫无表情。她走向直子，"是吗？"

"Tell Asuka that you're fine."  
“告诉明日香你没事。”

Rei nods, she stares at Asuka as if she was a stranger. "I am fine."  
绫波点头，她盯着明日香，仿佛她是个陌生人。“我没事。”

"I don't think she believes you. Can you lift up your shirt, please?" Naoko asks politely.  
“我觉得她不相信你。请你把上衣掀起来好吗？”直子礼貌地问道。

She nods again and lifts up her hospital gown, revealing a fresh bandage wrapped around her stomach, a thin red line bleeds into the bandage. Rei turns her head to Naoko who nods, and she releases the gown. Asuka shudders and fights the burning sensation in her eyes as she realizes that Rei's pony tail length is only a short stump.  
她再次点头，掀起医院的病号服，露出腹部缠着的新绷带，一条细细的红线渗入绷带。丽转向直子，后者点头示意，她便放下了病号服。明日香颤抖着，强忍着眼中的灼热感，意识到丽的马尾长度只剩下一小截。

Naoko gently grasps Rei's shoulders and turns her towards Asuka. "See?"  
直子轻轻抓住丽的肩膀，将她转向明日香。“看到了吗？”

The Commander smiles, "Good as new."  
指挥官微笑着说：“焕然一新。”

### Chapter 3 A Home With No Visitors

Naoko clicked her pen in thought while she studied Unit-02 through the massive display screen.  
直子一边思考着，一边用笔轻敲着桌面，同时透过巨大的显示屏观察着二号机。

"...Commander, should I increase LCL pressure and call in recovery?" Ritsuko asked hesitantly.  
“...指挥官，我是否应该增加 LCL 压力并呼叫回收？”律子犹豫地问道。

It kneeled beside the sunken body of Unit-00, submerged in a pool of Sachiel's blood. Unit-02 would have been camouflaged in the ocean's stain, had it not been for the way it rocked back and forth.  
它跪在浸没于萨基尔血液池中的零号机旁。若非其前后摇摆的动作，二号机本会隐匿于这片血海的污迹之中。

Asuka stared at her reflection through the crimson pool, her hands trembled as she ran her fingertips along the four yellow eyes that had erupted from her smooth, nose-less skull.  
明日香透过猩红的池水凝视着自己的倒影，手指颤抖地沿着从她光滑无鼻的颅骨上迸发出的四只黄色眼睛滑过。

Not at a loss, Naoko looked at Kyoko, "What do you think?" She asked.  
直子并未慌乱，她看着京子，问道：“你怎么看？”

Her Sub-Commander and Chief Scientist held her hands behind her back. Kyoko's dull eyes did not catch the harsh light of the monitor as she scanned its subject, "She isn't lucid. But she still has her motor functions." Kyoko glanced at the far corner of the screen. "There are still two minutes remaining on her internal power. Time is of the essence, Commander. She must return to the Geofront-"  
她的副指挥官兼首席科学家将她的双手背在身后。绫子的呆滞眼神并未捕捉到监视器上刺眼的光芒，她审视着屏幕中的对象，“她神志不清。但她的运动功能依然存在。”绫子瞥了一眼屏幕的远角。“她的内置电源还剩两分钟。时间紧迫，指挥官。她必须返回地底都市——”

"_No…"_ Asuka spoke to herself through the audio feed, "_No, no, no… that isn't me-"_  
“不……”明日香通过音频反馈自言自语，“不，不，不……那不是我——”

Naoko pressed the talk button for the direct radio feed, static crackled, "Asuka, honey? Are you alright?"  
直子按下直接无线电通讯的通话键，一阵静电声响起，“明日香，亲爱的？你还好吗？”

Unit-02 let out a deafening shriek that sent ripples through the water, the EVA began to strike its own head.  
零二号机发出一声震耳欲聋的尖叫，水面泛起阵阵涟漪，EVA 开始猛击自己的头部。

The Commander covered her mouth. "Oh, Asuka…"  
指挥官捂住了嘴。“哦，明日香……”

Misato stepped beside Naoko, "Commander, we need to call in recovery now. She's going to hurt herself."  
美里走到直子身边，“指挥官，我们现在需要呼叫回收队。她会伤害到自己的。”

"_-Isn't me, That isn't me-"_  
"-那不是我，那不是我-"

"Or Unit-02." Kyoko added. "Which is why she needs to report back to HQ before her timer runs out." She turned to Naoko. "We should activate the-"  
"或者二号机。" 绫子补充道。"这就是为什么她需要在计时结束前返回总部。" 她转向直子。"我们应该启动——"

Naoko waved a dismissive hand, "That won't be necessary." She gestured to the screen. "She might be in a fugue state, but like you said, she's still responding to stimuli."  
直子不以为意地挥了挥手，"那没必要。" 她指向屏幕。"她可能处于失忆状态，但正如你所说，她仍在对刺激做出反应。"

She reached for the intercom, but Naoko's hand was blocked by Misato's. "Please let me talk to her."  
她伸手去拿对讲机，但直子的手被美里挡住了。“请让我跟她谈谈。”

The Commander raised an eyebrow.  
指挥官挑了挑眉。

Misato reminded herself of her position, "With your permission, Commander."  
"美里提醒自己注意身份，“请您允许，指挥官。””

Naoko's eyes darted to the timer, she nodded. "Yes. Good luck."  
直子的目光迅速扫向计时器，她点点头。“是的。祝你好运。”

She took in a sharp breath. "Thank you." Her hands trembled as she reached for the intercom.  
她深吸了一口气。“谢谢你。”她的手颤抖着伸向对讲机。

"_None of this is the real me…"_ Asuka said in between strikes, her voice slurred as she rocked.  
“这些都不是真正的我……”明日香在攻击间隙说道，她的声音含糊不清，身体摇摇晃晃。

"...Hey, kiddo." Misato whispered softly.  
“……嘿，孩子。”美里轻声细语地说道。

Unit-02's hand halted. 2 号机的手停住了。

"Hey, it's me, It's Misato." She smiled, with the hope her warmth could reach her. "It's okay, we're going to get you help. Can you walk?" She waited for a response that didn't come. "I just need you to walk, just a little bit." No response. "Can you hear me?"  
"嘿，是我，我是美里。" 她微笑着，希望自己的温暖能传递给她。 "没事的，我们会帮你。你能走吗？" 她等待着回应，但没有声音。 "我只需要你走几步，就一点点。" 依然没有回应。 "你能听到我吗？"

Nothing. Asuka rocked back and forth in the EVA.  
什么也没有。明日香在 EVA 中前后摇晃着。

She shuddered. Misato's eyes darted to the side as she thought of a way to bring her back to reality. "When you get back, we'll go and get some burgers. You remember those ones by the arcade? With the extra spicy ones?" No response. "C'mon… you're going to be late for school."  
她颤抖了一下。美里眼神飘向一旁，思考着如何将她拉回现实。“等你回来，我们去吃汉堡吧。还记得游戏厅旁边的那家吗？有特辣的那种？”没有回应。“来吧……你上学要迟到了。”

"Commander." Ritsuko called out from her desk, "One minute left on the internal battery."  
“指挥官。”律子从她的办公桌那边喊道，“内部电池只剩一分钟了。”

Naoko turned to Misato and wound her wrist in a 'wrap-it-up' motion.  
直子转向美里，手腕一转，做了个‘结束吧’的手势。

Misato bit her lip. "...I know you're scared. But it's okay, I'm here. I won't let anything happen to you. Let's go back to the Geofront-"  
美里咬了咬嘴唇。“……我知道你害怕。但没关系，我在这里。我不会让你有事的。我们回地底都市去——”

"-_No!"_ Unit-02's head shook violently, "_This isn't-"_  
"“——不！”二号机的头部猛烈摇晃，“这不是——”

A cold hand brushed Misato's aside. "Langley." Kyoko stated firmly, Unit-02's head perked up. "That's enough. There's an umbilical charging station four klicks north of your position. Recharge your internal battery, then report back to HQ."  
一只冰冷的手拂开了美里。“兰利。”绫子坚定地说道，二号机的头部随即抬起。“够了。在你位置以北四公里处有一个脐带充电站。给你的内部电池充电，然后向总部报告。”

Unit-02's body stood up immediately, it shuffled through the blood red ocean, its movement uncoordinated, head hung low.  
二号机的身体立刻站了起来，它在血红色的海洋中蹒跚前行，动作不协调，头低垂着。

It turned to look back at Unit-00's floating body.  
它转过身，看向零号机悬浮的身体。

"Double time." Kyoko said. Unit-02 stopped dragging its feet and broke into a jog, it parted the sea into red tidal waves as it did.  
“加快速度。”绫子命令道。二号机不再拖沓，开始小跑起来，它所到之处，红色的浪潮被分开，如同涌动的潮水。

The entire command deck stood silent as they stared at the grisly scene Unit-02 left behind.  
整个指挥舱内一片寂静，所有人都凝视着二号机留下的惨烈景象。

While Tokyo-03, it's shoreline and highway were untouched, the flooded and overgrown ambush site of what was once the Yugawara skyscrapers was nothing more than a sinking mass of rubble, save for a few that protruded out, angled like a ribcage.  
尽管东京-03 及其海岸线和高速公路完好无损，但曾经是岳泽川摩天大楼的淹没且杂草丛生的伏击地点，如今只剩下沉没的废墟，只有几处像肋骨一样突出的残骸。

Around the crimson epicenter, a fine layer of dust circled and divided the ocean between blood and water, with the blue body of Unit-00, which floated in the very center.  
在深红色的中心周围，一层细尘环绕并分割了血与水之间的海洋，蓝色机体零号机正漂浮在正中央。

Before Misato could criticize her superior, Fuyutsuki spoke, "Commander, I have taken the liberty of calling in recovery, they are on their way to extract Unit-00."  
在美里能批评她的上司之前，冬月先开了口，“司令，我已自作主张呼叫了回收队，他们正在前往回收零号机的路上。”

"Yes, thank you, Kozo. And the pilot." Naoko added. "We mustn't forget the pilot."  
“是的，谢谢你，Kozo。还有那位驾驶员。”直子补充道，“我们绝不能忘了那位驾驶员。”

"..Right." Fuyutsuki said, his face turned away from Misato before she could make eye contact.  
“……好吧。”冬月说道，他的脸转向一旁，没让美里有机会对上视线。

She shook her head in disbelief, "But… Rei was nearly severed in half by that spear. Her pulse flatlined. She's-"  
她难以置信地摇了摇头，“但……丽被那长矛几乎劈成两半。她的心跳停止了。她——”

"-A tough girl." Naoko interjected. "Don't underestimate her. No doubt with Dr. Soryu's advanced treatments, she'll pull through."  
“——一个坚强的女孩。”直子插话道，“别小看她。毫无疑问，有了惣流博士的先进治疗，她会挺过来的。”

Misato glared at Kyoko, who was transfixed on the drone feed that showed Unit-02 run towards the power station.  
美里瞪着绫子，后者正目不转睛地盯着显示二号机跑向发电站的无人机画面。

The Commander nodded to herself. "But let's not forget what our pilots accomplished here today, all of you. All of you!"  
司令官自顾自地点了点头。“但别忘了我们今天飞行员所取得的成就，各位。所有人！”

The crew looked up from their monitors towards the Commander. "What our EVA's accomplished. What all of you took part in today." Naoko pointed to the pool of Angel blood. "Humanity has survived their first extra-terrestrial assault! Not only survived, but triumphed!"  
全体人员从监控屏幕上抬起头来看向指挥官。“我们的 EVA 所完成的壮举。今天你们所有人都参与其中。”直子指向天使血液的池子。“人类成功抵御了第一次地外攻击！不仅生存下来，还取得了胜利！”

She pointed at Maya Ibuki, "All because of you."  
她指向真希波·真理·伊吹，“全都是因为你。”

Maya perked up and realised the entire command deck watched her.  
真希波精神一振，意识到整个指挥舱的目光都集中在她身上。

"And you." She pointed at Ritsuko, and then at Hyuga, "And you!" Her finger reached every crew member as their spirits began to lift. "Months of planning… and not a single casualty or a part of the city damaged. I don't know about you, but I believe that's cause for celebration!"  
"还有你。" 她指向律子，然后是日向，"还有你！" 她的手指逐一触及每一位机组人员，他们的士气开始高涨。"数月的策划……没有一人伤亡，城市也完好无损。我不知道你们怎么想，但我认为这绝对值得庆祝！"

The NERV crew nodded amongst themselves, the horrific images put at the back of their minds. "Humanity has endured today because of your actions!" Naoko continued. "And will keep enduring! We wouldn't be here if it weren't for you all! I think all of you owe yourselves a round of applause!"  
NERV 的队员们相互点头，将那些恐怖的画面抛诸脑后。“正因为你们的行动，人类今天得以幸存！”直子继续说道，“并将继续生存下去！若非有你们，我们不会站在这里！我认为你们每个人都值得为自己鼓掌！”

She clapped. Yamagishi, her chief of security that constantly shadowed her, joined with a heavy, weighted clap.  
她开始鼓掌。山岸，那位始终如影随形的安全主管，也加入了进来，掌声沉重而有力。

Shigeru Aoba let out a whoop, which coaxed the crew into a tentative applause.  
青叶茂发出一声欢呼，这鼓励了队员们开始试探性地鼓掌。

Courage welled inside of Maya as shot up from her seat,, "A-and Asuka and Rei too! They saved us!"  
勇气在真嗣心中涌动，他猛地从座位上站起来，“还有明日香和绫波！她们也救了我们！”

The Commander nodded, "Well said, Lieutenant!" She pointed to the jogging Unit-02, "Asuka just saved humanity from extinction!" Naoko pressed on the intercom, "What do you have to say to her?"  
司令官点头赞许，“说得好，少尉！”她指向正在慢跑的二号机，“明日香刚刚拯救了人类免于灭绝！”直子按下对讲机，“你有什么想对她说的吗？”

The hesitant claps formed into a thunderous ovation as the dozens of computer technicians, analysts, security guards and workers roared in laudation.  
犹豫的掌声逐渐汇聚成雷鸣般的欢呼，数十名电脑技术员、分析师、保安和工人们爆发出热烈的赞扬声。

Shigeru Aoba cheered, "Hell yeah, kid! You kicked that Angel's ass!"  
青叶茂欢呼道，"太棒了，小子！你把那个使徒打得落花流水！"

"Rei, Asuka, you did it!" Maya added with sincere enthusiasm, "Congratulations!"  
“丽，明日香，你们做到了！”真希波也由衷地兴奋道，“恭喜你们！”

Makoto Hyuga stood up, his chair knocked over in the heat of the moment, "Yeah! Congrats, kid!"  
洞木光激动地站起身，椅子被撞翻在地，“太好了！恭喜你，小子！”

Ristuko Akagi nodded as she clapped, "Congratulations, Asuka!"  
秋月律子点头鼓掌，“恭喜你，明日香！”

"You're number one!" Naoko said with a thumbs up.  
"你是第一名！" 直子竖起大拇指说道。

"Congratulations!" "恭喜！"

In the midst of the booming cheers, Kozo Fuyutsuki hung his head in shame.  
在震耳欲聋的欢呼声中，冬月耕造羞愧地低下了头。

"Congratulations!" "恭喜！"

It felt wrong to applaud such carnage, Misato thought of the true visage behind the EVA's puppeteer. That look of hate, insanity and base bloodlust conveyed by an innocent girl.  
为这样的屠杀鼓掌似乎不对，Misato 想到了 EVA 操纵者背后的真实面目。那是一个纯真少女所流露出的仇恨、疯狂和原始的嗜血欲望。

Her girl. 她的女孩。

She watched the minimized screen that showed the pilot feed. It was overpowered and overlapped by the footage of humanity's titanic champion, who sprinted through the countryside.  
她盯着最小化的屏幕，上面显示着飞行员的实时画面。这画面被人类巨人般的冠军奔跑在乡间的影像所覆盖，显得格外强大且重叠。

Misato shook her head. The praise that Asuka had yearned for her entire life, the affirmation of her status as an elite pilot fell on deaf, vacant ears.  
美里摇了摇头。明日香一生都在渴望的赞誉，她作为精英飞行员的认可，却落在了聋哑、空洞的耳朵上。

Asuka's eyes were dull as she mechanically moved the control yokes, unblinking, indifferent to the blood that trickled down her left eyebrow onto her sunken cheekbones.  
明日香的眼神呆滞，她机械地操纵着控制杆，眨也不眨，对从左眉流下、染红了她凹陷颧骨的鲜血漠不关心。

"Congratulations!" "恭喜！"

The applause deafened her thoughts. Misato's eyes slowly traveled to Kyoko, who stood beside her.  
掌声淹没了她的思绪。美里缓缓将目光移向站在她身边的绫波。

Kyoko took no part in the revelry either, instead the Sub-Commander stared intently at the microscopic feed of Asuka. Whether she was deep in thought, or miles away, Misato could not tell.  
绫子也没有参与狂欢，相反，副指挥官目不转睛地盯着明日香的超微型反馈。无论是陷入沉思，还是心不在焉，美里无法分辨。

Either way, an irrational anger began to boil in Misato's stomach at the sight of the dull, dispassionate woman.  
无论如何，看到这个呆板冷漠的女人，美里心中无端的怒火开始沸腾。

"Congratulations!" "恭喜！"

A throb grew in her temple as she fantasized striking her in front of the entire command deck.  
她幻想在指挥甲板上当众给她一击，太阳穴随之突突跳动。

Kyoko Soryu's eyes darted sideways and caught Misato's amidst the crowd's endless cheer.  
在人群无休止的欢呼声中，绫波今子的目光斜向一瞥，与美里对上了视线。

She slowly turned her head as the biological mother and former guardian stared each other down.  
她缓缓转过头，生物学上的母亲和曾经的监护人相互对峙着。

"Congratulations!" "恭喜！"

---
"My!" Naoko exclaimed with a clap of her hands, "That was a productive day." She said to Kyoko as they strode down the busy hallways of the Geofront.  
"哎呀！" 直子拍手惊叹道，"真是充实的一天。" 她和京子走在地底都市繁忙的走廊上说道。

Misato, Ritsuko and Fuyutsuki walked behind the two, dark clouds that hovered over a bright leader. Their shoulders brushed against waves of energetic NERV crew that passed by them.  
美里、律子和冬月走在两人身后，乌云笼罩着一位明亮的领导者。他们的肩膀不时擦过充满活力的 NERV 工作人员。

The enthusiasm rallied out by the Commander's speech still possessed them, despite the fact that it was four-thirty in the morning.  
指挥官演讲中激发的激情依然在他们心中燃烧，尽管那时已是凌晨四点半。

"Yes..." Kyoko responded flatly, "But we went outside the parameters of our plan."  
“是的……”京子平淡地回应，“但我们超出了计划的范畴。”

Naoko looked down and smiled, "Plans change, Kyoko." Her unbuttoned black lab coat with a golden trim flowed as they walked. "Which is also in the parameters of our plan, isn't it?"  
直子低头微笑道，“计划总是会变的，京子。”她那未扣扣子的黑色实验室外套，饰以金色镶边，随着他们的步伐飘动。“这也是我们计划的一部分，不是吗？”

The Chief Scientist attempted to follow the logic. "...I suppose it could have gone worse."  
首席科学家试图跟上这个逻辑。“……我想情况可能更糟。”

"It did." Misato interjected. "It did for Rei."  
"确实如此。"美里插话道。"对绫波来说确实如此。"

Kyoko turned her head, unbothered the NERV crew that bumped into her. "She survived her injuries." She looked at Naoko, who nodded.  
京子转过头，对撞到她的 NERV 工作人员毫不在意。"她挺过了她的伤势。"她看着直子，直子点头表示同意。

"Yes, thank goodness." The Commander said.  
“是的，谢天谢地。”指挥官说道。

"It's going to take that poor girl months before she can walk again." Misato said. "Weeks, if she's lucky-"  
“那个可怜的女孩要花上几个月才能再次行走。”美里说，“如果幸运的话，几周——”

Naoko gave her a brief glance. "Oh, I'd give her an hour." She turned back, and the crew cleared a path for her, she walked backwards in heels. "You haven't seen Kyoko work her magic yet, have you?"  
直子匆匆瞥了她一眼。“哦，我会给她一个小时。”她转过身，船员们为她让出一条路，她穿着高跟鞋倒退着走。“你还没见识过京子施展她的魔法吧？”

"To repair an Evangelion is the true endeavor." Kyoko did not seem to notice the daggers Misato sent to the back of her head, or at least, did not acknowledge it. "None of the pilots received any critical injuries." She affirmed.  
“修复一台 EVA 才是真正的挑战。”绫子似乎并未察觉到美里射向她后脑勺的锐利目光，或者至少，她并未对此作出反应。“所有驾驶员都没有受到致命伤。”她肯定地说。

Misato stared at her in disbelief and stopped walking. "Asuka has an orbital fracture. She can't see out of her left eye."  
美里难以置信地盯着她，停下了脚步。“明日香有眼眶骨折，她的左眼看不见了。”

"Minimal. Langley will fully recover after a single treatment."  
"最小限度。兰利经过一次治疗就能完全康复。"

"You don't know that. She could have brain damage, and you forced her on her feet!" She called out to Kyoko.  
"你不能确定。她可能有脑损伤，而你却强迫她站起来！" 她向京子喊道。"

Kyoko stopped in place. She turned and regarded Misato evenly. "To relocate an active unit costs nearly a hundred thousand yen per kilometer. We don't have time to spend our budget on such luxuries."  
京子停下脚步。她转过身，平静地看着美里。"调动一个活跃单位的费用每公里将近十万日元。我们没有时间在这种奢侈的事情上花费预算。"

Misato stepped inches from her face, her breaths ragged, "That's what you care about? Money?"  
美里向前迈了几步，几乎贴到她的脸，呼吸急促，“你就关心这个？钱？”

Naoko stopped in the middle of the hallway, "Misato. We could argue over this all day. If you have any criticisms, please take it with me. All of my subordinates are under my responsibility."  
直子在走廊中央停下脚步，“美里。我们可以为此争论一整天。如果你有什么意见，请直接向我提出。我所有的下属都在我的责任之下。”

She could only glance at Kyoko's dull eyes for so long, before she retreated to the warmth Naoko emanated from her steady, patient gaze. "Are they? Are they completely?" Misato blinked. "With all due respect, Commander."  
她只能短暂地瞥一眼京子那呆滞的眼睛，随后便退回到直子那坚定而耐心的目光所散发出的温暖中。“是吗？完全如此吗？”美里眨了眨眼。“恕我直言，指挥官。”

The Commander put a hand on her Sub-Commander's shoulder. "Please, have some faith in her. Kyoko has made tremendous progress."  
指挥官将手放在副指挥官的肩上。“请对她有点信心。京子已经取得了巨大的进步。”

"She's right Misato." Ritsuko offered. "I can vouch for Dr. Soryu."  
"她说得对，美里。" 律子附和道，"我可以为碇博士担保。"

"Progress. From what?" Misato snorted. "From saying two full sentences to your daughter after eight years?"  
"进步？从什么方面？" 美里嗤之以鼻，"从八年里只对女儿说了两句完整的话？"

"...I have said more than two sentences. And she is in capable hands with her current guardian." Kyoko responded blankly. "Are you certain that you are one to speak of Langley's well being?"  
"...我已经说了不止两句话。而且她现在由一位能干的监护人照顾。" 绫子面无表情地回应。"你确定你有资格谈论兰利的福祉吗？"

Misato stared at her, "What are you trying to say?"  
美里盯着她，"你想说什么？"

Naoko stepped in between the two. "Ladies, please. We're blocking the hallway." She looked at her watch, and sighed. "I have a very important meeting to attend to, but we will circle back to this conversation, Misato."  
直子插进两人之间。"女士们，请别这样。我们挡住走廊了。"她看了看手表，叹了口气。"我有一个非常重要的会议要参加，但我们稍后会回到这个话题，美里。"

Misato crossed her arms, "No offense, 'mam. But I'd like to have a private conversation with the Sub-Commander."  
美里交叉双臂，“无意冒犯，女士。但我希望与副指挥官进行一次私人谈话。”

Kyoko glanced up and down at her, "Your opinion does not concern me, Captain. I must also attend this meeting. It is for essential personnel only."  
京子上下打量了她一番，“你的意见与我无关，上尉。我也必须参加这次会议。这是仅限关键人员参加的。”

"Come now, Kyoko. Her opinion is perfectly valid." Naoko turned to Misato, Fuyutsuki waited patiently in the sidelines. "Before I go, I have some good news." She smiled, "Shinji called me back, he agreed to pilot the EVA!"  
"好了，京子。她的意见完全合理。" 直子转向美里，冬月在一旁耐心等待。"在我离开之前，有个好消息。" 她微笑着说，"真嗣给我回电话了，他同意驾驶 EVA！"

Misato blinked. "...Really."  
美里眨了眨眼。"...真的。"

Fuyutsuki hung his head low.  
冬月低下了头。

"Did he sound like he was sure?" She continued.  
"他听起来像是确定吗？"她继续道。

"Of course, why wouldn't he be?" Naoko looked at her watch and winced, "Sorry, I'm in a bit of a hurry. Could you please pick him up at seven today, at the same station? After that we can touch base, moving forward?."  
"当然，他怎么会不在呢？" 直子看了看手表，皱了皱眉，"抱歉，我有点赶时间。你今天能七点去同一个车站接他吗？之后我们可以联系一下，继续推进？"

"I…" Misato hesitated and looked at Kyoko, "Yes, Commander."  
"我…" 美里犹豫了一下，看向京子，"是，指挥官。"

"But first things first, I need you and Ritsuko to oversee Unit 02 and 00's recovery. You probably won't be done before seven, so let Ritsuko hold the fort. How about after you pick up Shinji, we'll talk and then you take the rest of the day off. Sounds good?"  
"但首先，我需要你和律子监督二号机和零号机的回收工作。你们七点前可能完不成，所以让律子留守。你接了真嗣之后，我们谈谈，然后你就可以休息一天。这样好吗？"

Misato noted Naoko's body gradually turned away from the conversation, so she acquiesced with a polite smile. "Yes. Thank you 'mam."  
美里注意到直子逐渐将身体转向别处，于是她礼貌地微笑着顺从了。“是的，谢谢您，女士。”

"Come on, Misato. What did we talk about?" Naoko said as she walked backwards, unconcerned of the traffic, given the crew made way for her.  
“来吧，美里。我们之前谈了些什么？”直子一边倒退着走，一边说道，完全不顾交通情况，毕竟船员们都为她让路。

She laughed nervously, "Right, thank you, Naoko."  
她紧张地笑了笑，“对，谢谢你，直子。”

Naoko, Kyoko and Fuyutsuki took off, the latter offered a curt nod to the ladies. And with that, Ritsuko and Misato were left behind in the busy hallway. Ritsuko parted aside her burgundy hair and motioned for them to walk.  
直子、京子和冬月启程了，后者向女士们简短地点头示意。就这样，律子和美里被留在了繁忙的走廊上。律子拨开她那深红色的头发，示意她们一起走。

She followed her. "Are you sure she's okay?" Misato asked quietly.  
她跟了上去。“你确定她没事吗？”美里轻声问道。

"There was no sign of contamination, and like the Chief Scientist said, that fracture could be treated in a single session. Otherwise... to be honest, this is the first time I've seen her this week."  
“没有污染的迹象，而且正如首席科学家所说，那处骨折可以一次治疗好。否则...说实话，这是我这周第一次见到她。”

"You've been busy with work?"  
"你最近工作很忙吗？"

Ritsuko hummed in response, "It's not ideal, but she's always preferred to keep to herself."  
律子哼了一声作为回应，“虽然不理想，但她总是喜欢独来独往。”

"Not always…" Misato said to herself. "I probably don't have a right to ask, but-"  
"也不是一直这样……" 美里自言自语道。"我可能没有权利问，但是——"

"If Asuka wants to live somewhere else, then that's her choice." Ritsuko turned her head, "But I wouldn't stop you from asking." She offered. "Maybe it might be good for her to spend time with children her age."  
"如果明日香想住在别的地方，那是她的选择。" 律子转过头，"但我不会阻止你询问。" 她提议道。"或许让她和同龄的孩子相处一段时间对她有好处。"

"Doesn't she spend time with Rei?"  
"她不是经常和绫波在一起吗？"

"Not as much as she used to. I don't know what happened, but… I suppose people just grow apart after a while." Ritsuko sighed.  
"不像以前那么频繁了。我不知道发生了什么，但……我想人们相处久了，总会渐渐疏远的。" 律子叹了口气。"

Misato nodded slowly, "I guess they do."  
美里缓缓点头，“我想他们确实。”

They continued their walk in silence, their shoulders brushed against personnel. Ritsuko glanced at her coyly. "And I wasn't talking about Rei."  
他们继续默默地走着，肩膀不时擦过行人。律子羞涩地瞥了她一眼。“我说的不是丽。”

"Who, Shinji?" Misato chuckled, "She'd eat him alive, Rits.."  
“谁，真嗣吗？”美里轻笑，“她会把他吃得死死的，律子。”

She shrugged, "Him too, I guess."  
她耸耸肩，“他也是，我想。”

Misato blinked, "Then who-" She caught Ritsuko's smirk and nudged her shoulder, playfully. "-Oh, shut it!"  
美里眨了眨眼，“那么谁——”她捕捉到律子的坏笑，轻轻撞了撞她的肩膀，开玩笑地说，“——哦，闭嘴吧！”

The two shared a soft chuckle as they continued their walk. "All that matters is that they'll be on the mend soon." Ritsuko said.  
两人轻声笑了起来，继续他们的散步。“重要的是他们很快就会康复。”律子说道。

"Physically, maybe. That's one thing, but what about their hearts?"  
“身体上或许吧。这是一回事，但他们的内心呢？”

The brunette raised her eyebrow, "Let's not get philosophical here."  
那位棕发女子挑了挑眉，“我们别在这里谈哲学了。”

"Really?" Misato guffawed. "Coming from the woman who compares people to porcupines?"  
"真的吗？" 美里大笑起来。"这话居然出自那个把人比作豪猪的女人？"

"Hedgehogs, actually. And yes."  
"实际上是刺猬。没错。"

---

Naoko sat patiently in the unlit meeting room. Fuyutsuki and Kyoko stood beside either of her shoulders, their hands hidden behind their backs.  
直子安静地坐在未开灯的会议室里。冬月和京子分别站在她的两侧肩膀旁，双手藏在背后。

Instead of the expected seven Instrumentality Committee members, their seats were suddenly occupied by a shimmer of light, followed by a blared red that revealed seven massive, numbered monoliths.  
出乎意料的是，本应坐着七名人类补完委员会成员的座位上，突然被一束光芒占据，紧接着是一片刺眼的红色，显露出七座巨大的、标有序号的巨石碑。

The Commander was unphased, "Oh my, this is new!"  
司令官泰然自若，“哦，这可真是新鲜！”

The Monoliths didn't respond.  
巨石碑毫无反应。

"_..."_

"But new is good!" Naoko continued, "It's very… magnanimous! Whose idea was it? Was it you, Xiao? It was you, wasn't it?"  
"但新的是好的！" 直子继续说道，"这非常……慷慨大方！这是谁的主意？是你的主意吗，小？是你，对吧？"

"_We did not arrange this meeting for flattery."_ The centre Monolith stated, captioned simply as 1. "_There are far more pressing matters."_  
"我们安排这次会面不是为了恭维。" 中心单体简称为 1，陈述道，"有更紧迫的事情。"

"Yes, you're right." Naoko sighed. "What's on your mind, Keel?"  
"是的，你说得对。" 直子叹了口气，"你在想什么，基尔？"

Keel Lorenz was silent, the number 1 etched into his monolith blared red, as though to convey his annoyance.  
基尔·洛伦沉默不语，他那刻着数字 1 的石碑闪烁着红色，仿佛在传达他的恼怒。

"_You play a dangerous game, Akagi..."_ Number 4 said.  
"你玩的是危险的游戏，赤木..." 4 号说道。

"I can admit that my tactics left much at stake, but I never gamble."  
"我承认我的策略风险很大，但我从不赌博。"

"_The Angels have returned, just like last time."_ Number 6's shrill voice added to the discord. "_Yet you do not seem concerned whatsoever, what are we to make of your lax response to this crisis?"_  
“天使们又回来了，就像上次一样。”6 号的尖锐声音加剧了混乱。“然而你似乎毫不担忧，我们该如何理解你对这场危机的松懈态度？”

Naoko leaned closer to the 6th monolith that stood on her left. "Are you saying that you're afraid?" She whispered softly, "Is that why you've called this meeting? Do you wish for me to put your mind at ease?"  
直子向她左侧的第六座巨石碑靠得更近了些。“你是说你在害怕吗？”她轻声细语，“这就是你召集这次会议的原因吗？你想让我帮你安心吗？”

The 6th monolith did not respond, yet it's light did not blare like 1's did.  
第六座巨石碑没有回应，但它的光芒并未像 1 号那样闪耀。

If anything, it dimmed. 如果说有什么变化，那就是它变暗了。

"_With such sudden circumstances, concern is to be expected."_ Number 2 added, the most reasonable of the seven. "_Especially when calamity strikes without warning."_  
"在这种突如其来的情况下，担忧是可以预料的。" 七人中最理智的二号补充道，"尤其是当灾难毫无预警地降临。"

"There were some warnings."  
"其实是有一些预警的。"

"_You refer to the Dead Sea Scrolls."_ Number 2 said.  
"你提到的是死海古卷。" 二号说道。

"...Yes. And fifteen years to prepare, not to mention your generosity." Naoko offered her hands, "Gentlemen, think of this as a blessing. Your investments have been made worthwhile!"  
"……是的。而且准备了十五年，更不用说你的慷慨了。" 直子伸出手，"先生们，把这看作是一种恩赐吧。你们的投入已经物有所值！"

"_Worthwhile?"_ Number 4 said coldly. "_In the eyes of this committee, nearly a trillion yen spent on a single operation is not a blessing. It is a waste of valuable resources."_  
"物有所值？" 四号冷冷地说道，"在这个委员会看来，为一次行动花费近一万亿日元绝非恩赐，而是对宝贵资源的浪费。"

"_Our resources."_ Number 6 added. "_What do you have to say for yourself?"_  
“我们的资源。”6 号补充道，“你有什么要为自己辩解的吗？”

"Frankly, for only a third of our monthly budget?" Naoko scanned her audience and shrugged. "I think it's a bargain."  
“坦白说，只用了我们月预算的三分之一？”直子扫视着听众，耸了耸肩，“我认为这是笔划算的交易。”

Five of the monoliths roared in protest, their numbers flared a furious crimson light. Fuyutsuki shielded his eyes. Kyoko simply blinked.  
五座巨石同时发出抗议的轰鸣，它们的编号闪烁着愤怒的赤红光芒。冬月遮住了眼睛，而绫波只是眨了眨眼。

"_You insolent-"_ "你这无礼的——"

"_Countries have gone bankrupt, woman!"_  
"国家都破产了，女人！"

"_Yes! You said the EVAs' would be able to withstand the Angels!"_  
"是的！你说过 EVA 能抵挡使徒的！"

Naoko did not respond, she rested her hands flat on the table, her face unconcealed as she waited.  
直子没有回应，她将双手平放在桌上，面无表情地等待着。

"_I told you, we should bring back Ikari-"_  
"我告诉过你，我们应该把碇带回来——"

"_That's enough."_ Lorenz said, his calm tone of voice reached the other monoliths and were instantly silenced. "_Akagi. Elaborate."_  
"够了。" 洛伦兹说道，他平静的语调传到了其他巨石碑旁，立刻让众人安静下来。"赤木。详细说明一下。"

Naoko smiled politely. "Thank you, Keel. To answer your question, Prime Minister, I didn't lie. This was a close call yes, but my confidence wasn't misplaced. _My_ Evangelions are the only thing on this planet capable of fighting back. And the damage wasn't critical, Unit 00 and 02 will be fully operational in no less than a week. In the meantime, I have reserved aside Unit 01 in anticipation of another… crisis."  
直子礼貌地微笑着。“谢谢你，基尔。回答您的问题，首相，我没有撒谎。这次确实很惊险，但我的信心并非没有根据。我的 EVA 是地球上唯一能够反击的存在。而且损害并不严重，零号机和二号机将在不超过一周的时间内完全恢复运作。与此同时，我已经预留了一号机，以防备另一次……危机。”

Number 4 snorted, "_Ikari's green boy. You intend to give it to him, as though it were a toy, don't you have more pressing projects?"_  
四号冷哼一声，“碇的绿小子。你打算把它给他，就像是个玩具，难道没有更紧迫的项目吗？”

"Xiao, I think you, all of you in fact know that the Human Instrumentality Project is my first and foremost priority." Naoko raised her finger, "Young Shinji is critical to guiding humanity's last hope in the right direction. The rest are expendable."  
“小，我想你们，实际上你们所有人都知道，人类补完计划是我最首要的任务。”直子竖起手指，“年轻的真嗣对于引导人类最后的希望走向正确的方向至关重要。其他的都是可以牺牲的。”

Unseen by her, Kyoko's left eye twitched. She still felt it at the back of her head.  
她并未察觉，但绫波的左眼微微抽搐了一下。她仍能感觉到那股视线停留在脑后。

"_As all the other pilots are."_ Number 3 agreed. "_And you are certain there is no… personal bias attached to Ikari's son?"_  
“和其他所有驾驶员一样。”3 号同意道，“你确定没有……对碇司令的儿子带有个人偏见？”

She glanced back at Fuyutsuki, "None whatsoever, Abe. Once he's fulfilled his duty, he's about as valuable as the others."  
她回头瞥了一眼冬月，“绝对没有，阿部。一旦他完成了他的职责，他的价值和其他人没什么两样。”

"_Regardless, Akagi, you must admit this whole situation could have been handled better."_ Number 4 said.  
"无论如何，赤木，你得承认整个情况本可以处理得更好。" 四号说道。

"By who, Gendo?" Naoko smiled, "Please, if he had his way, he would have leveled the entire city, given his insatiable appetite for resources." She raised a finger. "Then, it would have been a crisis. Considering your needs, I located the battle in a place where no property damage could have been made."  
"谁来处理，碇？" 直子微笑道，"拜托，如果他随心所欲，他会夷平整个城市，鉴于他对资源的贪婪胃口。" 她竖起一根手指。"那样的话，就会是一场危机。考虑到你的需求，我选择了一个不会造成任何财产损失的战斗地点。"

"_Tokyo-03 could have been used for cover, to minimize damage to the units. An Evangelion is worth far more than a simple city. "_  
"东京-03 本可以作为掩护，以减少对单位的损害。一台 EVA 远比一座普通城市更有价值。"

"Is it?" Naoko turned back to her Chief Scientist, "Kyoko?"  
“是吗？”直子转回她的首席科学家，“京子？”

Kyoko pulled a data pad from her inner pocket from her black lab coat, "MAGI estimated nearly triple of our budget would have been spent should the fight have been taken to the city. Infrastructure would have taken a hit, other NERV operations would have been halted, civilians displaced and compensated, the economy halted-"  
京子从她的黑色实验服内袋中抽出一个数据板，“MAGI 估计，如果战斗发生在城市中，我们的预算几乎会翻三倍。基础设施会受损，其他 NERV 行动会中断，平民需要疏散和补偿，经济也会停滞——”

Number 1's light blared, "_Spare us the semantics."_  
1 号机的灯光闪烁，“别讲这些细节了。”

"But that's the point of all this, isn't it?" Naoko said, "To live as comfortably, and as much at peace as possible until New Year's Day. Your words, not mine." She tented her hands, which still rested on the table, "I gave you my word that I would work at a third of the cost that Gendo would have, and I intend to keep that promise."  
“但这正是这一切的意义所在，不是吗？”直子说道，“为了在新年之前尽可能舒适和平静地生活。这是你说的，不是我。”她将双手合十，依旧放在桌上，“我向你承诺过，我的工作成本只有源堂的三分之一，我打算遵守这个承诺。”

"_Time. Money. Personnel."_ Number 4 said. "_Keep these expunges to a minimum, and we will consider allowing you to maintain your agency. But no more pet projects."_  
“时间。金钱。人员。”4 号说道，“将这些开支降到最低，我们才会考虑让你继续保持你的机构。但不要再有宠爱的项目了。”

Naoko nodded, "Of course. I'll have the replica project shelved until we discover why an Angel was able to override it's recall intelligence-"  
直子点头道，“当然。我会将复制项目搁置，直到我们弄清楚为什么使徒能够覆盖其召回智能——”

"_That is not what we are referring to."_  
"那不是我们所说的。"

"_Yes."_ Number 3 spoke, Japan's representative, "_To activate another Ayanami series is another billion yen_, _and you have spent well over six-"_  
"是的。" 3 号发言，日本的代表，"激活另一个绫波系列需要再投入十亿日元，而你们已经花费了超过六亿——"

"_That we know of. And now you wish to develop another series?"_  
"据我们所知。而现在你们还想开发另一个系列吗？"

"That's still only what, a single percentage of our budget?" Naoko turned to Kyoko who shook her head, "Not even. The Ayanami series is necessary in order to protect the pilots that are more… troublesome to replace."  
“那也不过是预算的百分之一吧？”直子转向绫子，后者摇了摇头，“连百分之一都不到。为了保护那些更……难以替代的驾驶员，绫波系列是必要的。”

"_That remains to be seen."_ Number 1 said. "_Fuyutsuki, do you agree with this sentiment?"_  
“这还有待观察。”一号说道，“冬月，你同意这种看法吗？”

The monoliths tilted ever so slightly his way. Fuyutsuki looked down to see Naoko stare back at him expectantly.  
那些巨石碑微微向他倾斜。冬月低头一看，只见直子正期待地盯着他。

"...I do." "...我愿意。"

"_There is still the matter of the public eye. Information regarding the Angels may become public. NERV must work hard on their disinformation campaign."_ Number 3 said.  
"公众的目光仍需关注。有关使徒的信息可能会公开。NERV 必须努力进行他们的虚假信息宣传。" 三号说道。

"Already done, Kozo will touch base with you immediately afterwards about the B-22 scenario, Abe."  
"已经安排好了，之后高雄会立即与你联系关于 B-22 方案的事宜，安倍。"

"_That will have to wait."_ Number 1 said. "_We have more to speak of, without the three of you."_  
"那件事只能先搁置了。" 一号说道，"我们还有其他事情要谈，不包括你们三位。"

Naoko sighed, "In that case, I won't keep you." She smiled, "It was nice to hear from you all again!"  
直子叹了口气，"既然如此，我就不耽误你们了。"她微笑着，"能再次听到你们的声音真好！"

"_..."_

"_Keep up the good work. Akagi."_  
"继续努力，赤木。"

A shimmer of light, then the monoliths winked out of existence one by one until only Lorenz stood across from her.  
一束微光闪烁，随后巨石碑一个接一个地消失，直到只剩下洛伦兹站在她对面。

"_Akagi... There is no going back now."_  
“赤城...现在已无法回头了。”

"Oh, Keel." The Commander leaned back in her chair, "…There never was."  
“哦，基尔。”指挥官靠回椅背，“……从来就没有过。”

With a grunt, the first Monolith faded alongside the others.  
随着一声闷哼，第一座巨石碑与其他巨石碑一同消失。

The red, dramatic lights faded, replaced by the mundane green cloth that lined the walls of the committee room.  
红色戏剧性的灯光逐渐淡去，取而代之的是委员会会议室墙壁上平凡的绿色布帘。

Fuyutsuki stared in disbelief, the arguably most seven dangerous men in the world strung along by a soulless-  
副校长不可思议地凝视着，这七位世界上最具危险性的人物，竟然被一个无灵魂的——

Naoko clapped her hands together. "So! Who's hungry?"  
直子拍了拍手。“那么！谁饿了？”

_I floated inside the abyss for so long. There were visitors, occasionally, but I never remembered their faces.  
我在深渊中漂浮了许久。偶尔会有访客，但我从未记住他们的面孔。_

_The only thing to ever keep me company were mirrors on all sides. Everywhere I looked, my reflections smiled back at me, their eyes dull and empty.  
唯一陪伴我的，是四周的镜子。无论我望向何处，我的倒影都回以微笑，眼神却呆滞空洞。_

_I was moved to another tank, a smaller one. That's when I knew.  
我被转移到了另一个水箱，一个更小的。那一刻，我明白了。_

_There was no mirror.  那里没有镜子。_

_Are they even me? 它们真的还是我吗？_

_In that tank, I had my first dream. Whenever I recalled it, my stomach turned into acid, my spine sprouted needles and my skin felt as though it melted. Yet I kept going back to it. I kept going back home.  
在那水槽里，我做了第一个梦。每当我想起它，胃里就像灌满了酸液，脊背上长出针刺，皮肤仿佛在融化。然而我不断回溯那个梦境。我不断回到那个家。_

_I dreamed of a field of blue flowers. A fire swept over the land and left it burnt black. The ashes soaked in a tide of the tangerine liquid that has nourished me all of my life.  
我梦见一片蓝色的花海。一场大火席卷而过，留下焦黑的土地。灰烬被那滋养我一生的橘色液体潮水所浸透。_

_Among the desolate landscape, only one flower survived, its stem bent by the unrelenting tides.  
在这荒凉的景象中，唯有一朵花幸存，它的茎秆被无情潮水压弯。_

_It's single blue petal floated in the charred grasslands…  
那片孤零零的蓝色花瓣飘落在焦黑的草地上……_

_A knock woke me up from my dream, my vision was blurry as the liquid escaped into bubbles with my breath.  
一阵敲门声将我从梦中唤醒，视线模糊中，液体随着我的呼吸化作气泡逸出。_

_There she was again.  她又出现了。_

_The woman smiled at me, and I felt warmth.  
那女人对我微笑，我感到一阵温暖。_

"Good morning, Yui." She whispered softly.  
“早上好，Yui。”她轻声细语。

_...Yui? ……Yui？_

_Is that my name? 那是我的名字吗？_

Naoko waved a flashlight past the fresh Ayanami series' pupils. They dilated ever so slightly, yet she seemed unphased by the harsh light. "How are you feeling?"  
直子挥动着手电筒，照向新版绫波系列的瞳孔。她们的瞳孔微微扩张，但似乎并未被强光所影响。“你感觉如何？”

The dull thing stared off into the distance, her eyes nearly crossed. "I do not know."  
她那呆滞的目光投向远方，双眼几乎要交叉。“我不知道。”

"You've hardly touched your food."  
"你几乎没动你的食物。"

Yui looked down at the plate. Naoko called it a steak earlier. She kept her face as far away from it as possible, the smell made her sick. "What do I do with it?"  
优依低头看着盘子。直子之前称之为牛排。她尽量把脸远离它，那气味让她感到恶心。“我该怎么处理它？”

"You eat it, silly." Naoko offered her utensils, a knife and a fork. "With this."  
"你吃掉它，傻瓜。" 直子递给她餐具，一把刀和一把叉。"用这个。"

Hesitantly, Yui cut off a small square of the steak and touched it on her tongue. She gagged.  
犹豫了一下，Yui 切下一小块牛排，用舌头轻轻触碰。她顿时作呕。

"You don't like my cooking?"  
“你不喜欢我做的菜吗？”

Yui blinked at her. "What is 'like'?''  
Yui 眨眼看着她。“'喜欢'是什么意思？”

Naoko giggled, "It means you enjoy it, silly. That it's tasty."  
"直子咯咯笑道，“意思是说你喜欢它，傻瓜。觉得它好吃。””

"It tastes like blood-" “它尝起来像血——”

Naoko's smile dropped. "Eat. That's an order."  
直子的笑容消失了。“吃掉。这是命令。”

"Yes, mam." Yui forced herself to shovel down the steak.  
“是的，女士。”优依强迫自己大口吃下牛排。

Her smile returned as she quietly watched the girl eat. "Don't worry. You only think it tastes bad. In truth you only really feel… reflexes. Spasms."  
她微笑着，静静地看着女孩进食。“别担心。你只是觉得它味道不好。实际上，你真正感受到的只是……反射动作。痉挛。”

She reached in her coat and produced four items: A metallic hair tie, a notebook, a gauze and a scalpel. Naoko neatly laid them out on the table inside her office.  
她从外套里拿出四样东西：一个金属发圈，一个笔记本，一块纱布和一个手术刀。直子整齐地将它们摆放在办公室的桌子上。

She tented her hands and laid them on the table. "So, how much do you remember this time?"  
她双手合十，放在桌上。“那么，这次你记得多少？”

Yui looked up at her and swallowed. "Remember?"  
Yui 抬头看着她，咽了咽口水。“记得？”

"Yes. Memories of... anything. What do you remember about Sachiel?"  
“是的。关于...任何事的记忆。你对萨基尔记得些什么？”

"...Who?" "...谁？"

Naoko's hands clenched. "Don't play stupid. You always remember something."  
直子的双手紧握。“别装傻。你总是记得一些事情。”

Yui's eyes ever so slightly lost their dullness, her breathing irregular, "I do not. I am telling you the truth."  
优衣的眼神微微恢复了些许光彩，呼吸变得不规律，“我没有。我说的都是实话。”

She looked down at the table and brushed her hands along its contents, "Maybe this will help jog your memory…"  
她低头看着桌子，双手沿着上面的物品轻轻拂过，“也许这能帮你唤醒记忆……”

The ghostly girl's eyes slowly followed Naoko's fingers brush along the scalpel.  
幽灵女孩的目光缓缓跟随直子的手指掠过手术刀。

Naoko's hand stopped at the book. She handed it to Yui. "Here. Read it."  
直子的手停在书上。她将书递给优，“给，读读看。”

The blue hair girl gingerly reached for the book, the front of it showed a shirtless man who held a bashful woman. "This is… a book?"  
蓝发女孩小心翼翼地伸向那本书，封面展示着一个赤膊男子怀抱着一位羞涩的女子。“这是……一本书？”

"That's right, you always loved reading books."  
“没错，你一直喜欢读书。”

Yui blinked, "I do?" 结衣眨了眨眼，“我真有这爱好？”

"Well, not you. You only think you do. Take off the cover."  
"哦，不是你。你只是以为你知道。把封套拿掉。"

Yui slid off the paper back cover, to reveal a green leather-bound casing. Hesitantly, she opened the book and scanned the first page. "This is not Kanji, but… I know these letters." Her pupil's dilated, "Ancient Hebrew."  
结衣轻轻地取下纸质封套，露出了一个绿色皮革包裹的封面。她犹豫地打开书，扫视了第一页。“这不是汉字，但是……我认识这些字母。”她的瞳孔放大了，“古希伯来语。”

"There you go, that's it." Naoko nodded. "You and your little chicken scratches… what does it say?"  
"没错，就是这样。"直子点头道。"你和你那些小鸡抓痕……上面写着什么？"

"It is hard to…" Yui peered at the coded letters, her eyes darted back and forth. She pointed at an illegible word, "Sachiel. Water, covering, price… Do I know this person?"  
"这很难……" 优依盯着那些编码的字母，眼睛来回扫视。她指着一个难以辨认的词，"萨基尔。水，覆盖，代价……我认识这个人吗？"

Naoko nodded again. "In a way, yes. It is an Angel, they're monsters that are trying to wipe out humanity."  
直子再次点头。"从某种意义上说，是的。这是一个使徒，它们是试图消灭人类的怪物。"

"What is a monster?" "什么是怪物？"

"They're large, hideous, evil things. But they take other forms, like-" Naoko paused, not yet. "It will be your purpose to help stop them."  
"它们庞大、丑陋、邪恶。但它们也会变成其他形态，比如——" 直子顿了顿，还没到时候。"你的使命就是帮助阻止它们。"

Yui's eyes lit up ever so slightly, "I have a purpose?"  
唯的眼睛微微一亮，"我有使命吗？"

"That's right. A very special one. Go to the next page."  
"没错。一个非常特别的使命。翻到下一页。"

The girl's pale, delicate, crushable hand shifted over to the next page. The strange letters became harder and harder to decipher, and were accompanied by odd drawings. Yui traced her finger along one particular sentence. "Shamshel. Morning. Conqueror." She raised her head in realization. "This is the next Angel."  
女孩苍白、纤细、易碎的手移向下一页。那些奇怪的字母变得越来越难以辨认，旁边还伴有一些奇异的图画。Yui 用手指沿着某句话划过。“沙姆沙尔。清晨。征服者。”她恍然抬头。“这是下一个使徒。”

Naoko smiled. "That's right, Yui. Very good." The praise looked as though it sent a strange, phantom feeling in the girl's stomach, as though butterflies occupied it. "What else?"  
直子微笑道：“没错，Yui。很好。”这番夸奖似乎在女孩的胃里激起了一种奇异的、虚幻的感觉，仿佛有蝴蝶在其中飞舞。“还有什么？”

"There is a date. February 26th, 2015."  
“这里有个日期。2015 年 2 月 26 日。”

She nodded. "That's when the next monster will come."  
她点点头。“那时下一个怪物就会出现。”

Yui's breathing intensified, but different than before, she was getting eager. Atleast, she thought she was. "And the next page, Ramiel. March 30th-"  
Yui 的呼吸加剧了，但与之前不同，她变得急切起来。至少，她觉得自己是这样。“下一页，拉米尔。3 月 30 日——”

Naoko's hands curled around the book. "That's enough for now, Yui. You must be getting tired, being asleep for so long."  
直子的手紧紧抓住书本。“现在够了，Yui。你一定累了，睡了这么久。”

"Asleep?" Yui flipped through the page adjacent to the front cover. A small name in Kanji was etched into the corner. "Yui. I am... Yui?"  
"睡着了？" 优翻到封面旁边的页码。角落里刻着一个小小的汉字名字。"优。我是...优？"

"Ah. This is where it gets complicated." Naoko gently took the book out of her hands and slid it back into her coat pocket. "Yes and no. Do you know what a clone is?"  
"啊。这里开始就复杂了。" 直子轻轻地从她手中拿过书，把它滑回她的外套口袋。"是也不是。你知道克隆是什么吗？"

"...No?" "...不知道？"

"It's a copy of someone, an imitation." Naoko pressed her lips tightly and held back a smile. "A pale imitation."  
"这是某人的复制品，一个模仿品。" 直子紧抿双唇，强忍笑意。"一个苍白的模仿品。"

"I see." Yui looked at her alabaster hands. "I am… a copy of Yui? That is why you are asking me if I remember her memories? Because I am like her?"  
"我明白了。" 由依看着自己苍白的手。"我是……由依的复制品？这就是你问我是否记得她的记忆的原因？因为我像她？"

"Oh yes. You're so much like her, you don't even have a s-" Naoko breathed heavily "Do you remember what I said about monsters?"  
"哦，是的。你太像她了，甚至没有自己的——" 直子深吸一口气 "你还记得我关于怪物的话吗？"

Yui nodded slowly, "That they can take other forms."  
Yui 缓缓点头，“他们能变成其他形态。”

"That's right." "是的。"

She looked at her hands, "...I am a monster?"  
她看着自己的双手，“……我是个怪物吗？”

Naoko's face tightened into a wince. "I don't want to hurt you, but… yes. You did very bad things Yui. Very bad. You twisted the minds of your husband and your little boy. Turned them-" She stopped herself. "Yui killed herself. In front of them. She played God and when it was too much for you to handle, you dumped everything onto my lap. I tried to make do, but…It's up to you to atone for her crimes."  
直子的脸因痛苦而紧绷。“我不想伤害你，但……是的。Yui，你做了很坏的事情。非常坏。你扭曲了你丈夫和小孩的思想。把他们——”她顿住了。“Yui 在她面前自杀了。她扮演上帝，当这一切变得无法承受时，你把所有事情都推到了我身上。我尽力应对，但……赎回她的罪孽，是你必须承担的责任。”

Yui did not respond for a very long time. Naoko couldn't tell if she attempted to process this information, or if she simply spaced out, since that dull look returned to her eyes.  
优依沉默了许久。直子无法判断她是在努力消化这些信息，还是单纯地走神了，因为她眼中又浮现出那种呆滞的神情。

"...I see." Yui's hands rested on her hospital gown. "I shall do everything in my power to atone."  
“……我明白了。”优依的双手放在病号服上，“我会尽我所能去赎罪。”

Naoko smiled, "I know you will." She breathed sharply, "You were asking about Sachiel, you piloted an Evangelion in order to fight it with another pilot, but we'll get to that later. The point is Yui, your previous clone died to defeat it. You will take her place. In fact, I have a very special job for you."  
直子微笑道：“我知道你会的。”她深吸一口气，“你之前问起萨基尔，你曾驾驶过一台 EVA 与另一位驾驶员一起对抗它，不过那都是后话了。关键是，优依，你之前的克隆体为了击败它而牺牲了。你将接替她的位置。事实上，我有一个非常特别的任务要交给你。”

"Whatever I am ordered to do, I shall."  
"无论被命令做什么，我都会去做。"

"Nobody knows who you really are. To the outside world, to your superiors, your co-pilots, you are Rei Ayanami-"  
"没有人知道你的真实身份。对外界，对你的上级，你的副驾驶们来说，你是绫波零——"

"But I thought I was Yui-"  
"但我认为我是唯——"

Naoko simply raised her hand, which caused Yui to flinch. She breathed through her nostrils. "Don't interrupt me again."  
直子只是举起了手，这让由依不由得一缩。她用鼻孔深吸了一口气。“别再打断我了。”

"It will not happen again."  
“不会再有下次了。”

"Who are you?" "你是谁？"

"Yui-" She froze, then a blink. "Rei Ayanami."  
“由依——”她顿住了，随即眨了眨眼。“绫波丽。”

"Say it again." "再说一遍。"

"...Rei Ayanami." "...绫波零。"

The Commander nodded, "Now, before I was interrupted." She took a moment to scan her face to see if she elicited a reaction from Yui. "You are Rei Ayanami. You'll speak when spoken to, and not make any friends at school. There are two exceptions."  
"指挥官点头道：“现在，在我被打断之前。”她稍作停顿，审视着绫波零的面容，看是否引起了她的反应。“你是绫波零。在学校里，别人不问你就不说话，也不交朋友。但有两个例外。”

Naoko raised two fingers. "Asuka Langley Soryu and Shinji Ikari, you'll do whatever they say, listen to whatever they say. Then, you'll meet with me and tell me everything. Everything. What's different about them, anything slightly off. Am I understood?"  
直子竖起两根手指。“明日香·兰格雷和真嗣，你们要完全听从他们的指示，无论他们说什么都要照做。然后，你们要来见我，告诉我所有的事情。所有细节。他们有什么不同，任何微小的异常。明白了吗？”

Yui stared at her blankly. "Yes 'mam."  
唯愣愣地看着她。“是的，女士。”

"Good. Of course…" She looked at the other contents on the table, "Since we have to give the impression that the previous "Rei" survived her injuries, appearances must be kept. Do you object to that?"  
“很好。当然……”她瞥了一眼桌上的其他物品，“既然我们必须给人留下前一个‘绫波’成功从伤势中恢复的印象，外表上的维护是必要的。你对此有异议吗？”

"...No 'mam." "...不，妈妈。"

Naoko scanned her face and pouted, "Oh… poor thing. There's not a thought behind those eyes, is there? Not a single one." She gently patted Yui's head.  
直子打量着她的脸，噘起嘴说：“哦……可怜的孩子。你眼里什么想法都没有，是吧？一个都没有。”她轻轻拍了拍结衣的头。

Yui turned to look Naoko directly in the eyes, dull crimson met shining viridian.  
结衣转过身，直视直子的眼睛，暗淡的深红与闪耀的碧绿相遇。

Her pupils' constricted. 她的瞳孔收缩了。

"...No 'mam." “……不，女士。”

A waitress slid two cold, foamy beers and a chuhai on the table. "Enjoy your drinks!"  
一位女服务员将两杯冰凉、泡沫丰富的啤酒和一杯 Chuhai 滑到桌上。“请享用您的饮品！”

Maya Ibuki offered a chipper smile, "Thank you, we will!"  
玛雅·伊布吕微笑着，"谢谢，我们会去的！"

Shigeru looked at his drink and frowned. "Two drinks per hour. Good grief."  
慎看了一眼他的饮料，皱起眉头。"每小时两杯。天哪。"

The rustic bar was jammed full. Despite the early hours, evidently, many workers needed to drown out their daily life. The cheerful pop music was an uncomfortable contrast tune to the grisly events of earlier today.  
这家乡村酒吧挤得满满的。尽管时间尚早，显然许多工人需要借酒消愁。欢快的流行音乐与今天早些时候的惨烈事件形成了令人不适的对比。

"_Gotta make a move to a town that's right for me, Town to keep me movin', keep me groovin' with some energy…"_  
"得找个适合我的小镇搬过去，一个让我活力四射、舞动不停的地方……"

No one here even knew what transpired in the ruins of Yugawara yet.  
这里还没人知道在汤河原的废墟中发生了什么。

As soon as the waitress left, the three NERV bridge crew sighed and stared at their drinks.  
女服务员一离开，NERV 的三位桥员就叹了口气，盯着他们的饮料。

Hyuga Aoba clutched at his forehead, eyes baggy and wide. "We have to go back to work in six hours."  
日向葵紧紧抓着额头，眼睛肿胀而睁大。“我们六小时后还得回去工作。”

"Please don't remind me." Maya groaned as she sipped at her highball drink.  
“请别提醒我。”真雅呻吟着啜饮她的威士忌苏打。

Silence. 沉默。

"_Won't you take me to… funky town!"_  
"难道你不带我去……放克镇吗！"

"I'm, I'm sorry-" Shigeru Aoba stammered. "-Can we take a moment to talk about how fucked up that was?"  
“我，我很抱歉——”四方阿波连结巴道。“-我们能花点时间谈谈那件事有多糟糕吗？”

Maya groaned again, "Oh god."  
真弓再次呻吟道，“哦天哪。”

"Here we go-" Hyuga added.  
“又来了——”飒田补充道。

"_Won't you take me to… funky town!"_  
"难道你不带我去……放克镇吗！"

"-Am I the only one that's bothered by this?"  
"-难道只有我一个人对此感到困扰吗？"

"Of course not." Maya said, "But didn't we come here to forget about work?"  
"当然不是。" 真由说，"但我们来这里不就是为了忘记工作吗？"

"You see!?" Shigeru banged his fist on the table, "This is why work needs a therapist or something. Everyone just... bottles everything up! For god's sake-" He darted his head back and forth. "-A kid died!" He whispered sharply.  
""你看！？" 茂把手猛地拍在桌子上，"这就是为什么工作需要一个心理医生之类的。大家只是...把一切都憋在心里！看在上帝的份上——" 他来回转动着头。"——一个孩子死了！" 他尖锐地低声说道。

"Aoba." Maya rubbed her temple, "For the last time, Rei didn't die. She's being treated right now."  
"青叶。" 真矢揉着太阳穴，"最后一次，玲不算是死了。她现在正在接受治疗。"

"I'm just saying, Ibuki. No one survives getting their guts ripped open like that. I- I mean, did you see the feed?" Aoba motioned his hand along his belly and made a grotesque _slick_ sound. "She was almost cut in-"  
"我只是说，五十铃。没人能在那样被开膛破肚后还活下来。我——我是说，你看了视频吗？" 青叶用手沿着腹部比划，发出一种令人作呕的滑腻声。"她几乎被切成了——"

"-Dude!" Hyuga hissed. "——伙计！" 日向低声喝道。

"What?" "什么？"

"You know we can't talk shop when we're outside."  
"你知道我们在外面不能谈工作的事。"

Aoba crossed his arms, "Well, you guys might have thick skin for this job, but I'm a musician, I gotta play to the tunes my heart demands."  
青叶交叉双臂，""好吧，你们可能对这份工作皮糙肉厚，但我是个音乐家，我得按照内心的旋律来演奏。""

Hyuga squinted, "What does that even mean-"  
日向眯起眼睛，""那到底是什么意思——"

"-It bothers me." Maya spoke up, the two boys turned to her, she frowned at her drink. "A lot. To be honest, I don't even know how I'm gonna sleep after this. Just-" She shuddered. "-The screams... and Asuka-" She gulped, "-Can we talk about something else? Please?"  
"-这让我很困扰。" 真矢开口了，两个男孩转向她，她皱着眉看着自己的饮料。"非常困扰。说实话，我都不知道今晚怎么睡得着。只是——" 她颤抖了一下。"那些尖叫声……还有明日香——" 她咽了口唾沫，"我们能谈点别的吗？求你了？"

The three hung their heads in silence, unsure what to say as the cheery pop music blasted in the background.  
三人低着头沉默不语，背景中欢快的流行音乐轰鸣着，他们不知道该说什么。

Aoba sniggered to himself. "O-okay." He raised three fingers, "Katsuragi, Akagi and Soryu. Kill, bang, marry. Go!"  
青叶自顾自地窃笑起来。"好-好吧。" 他举起三根手指，"桂木、赤城和苍龙。杀掉、上床、结婚。开始吧！"

The two stared at him in disbelief.  
两人难以置信地盯着他。

"_Won't you take me to… funky town!"_  
"难道你不带我去……放克镇吗！"

"...Are you serious?" Hyuga said.  
“……你是认真的吗？”日向说。

"You guys said you wanted to change the subject."  
“你们不是说想换个话题吗。”

Hyuga adjusted his glasses and sighed. "We're talking about the Sub-Commander, right? "  
日向调整了一下眼镜，叹了口气。“我们说的是副司令，对吧？”

Aoba blinked in confusion, "Soryu has a daughter?"  
青叶一脸困惑，“索龙有个女儿？”

"Yeah dude, Asuka." “是啊，兄弟，明日香。”

"But I thought her name was Langley?" He scratched at his head in confusion.  
"但我记得她名字是兰利？" 他困惑地挠了挠头。

"No, you airhead." Maya shook her head, "They're estranged."  
"不，你这个笨蛋。" 真矢摇了摇头，"她们已经疏远了。"

"...Oh." Aoba shrugged, "So… she's a MIL-"  
"...哦。" 青叶耸了耸肩，"所以…她是位军…"

"-Shigeru Aoba, don't you dare finish that sentence." Maya said sternly. "That's derogatory."  
"-Shigeru Aoba，你敢把那句话说完试试。" Maya 严厉地说道。"那是贬义的。"

"Okay, fine. Fine." He cleared his throat. "…. So?"  
"好吧，好吧。" 他清了清嗓子。"……所以呢？"

Hyuga groaned and raised three fingers. "Kill Soryu. Bang Akagi. M… Marry Katsuragi."  
日向呻吟着举起三根手指。"杀掉 Soryu。搞定 Akagi。M……娶 Katsuragi。"

青叶挑了挑眉，“真的？我会说：干掉赤木，搞定葛城，娶了惣流。”
Shigeru raised an eyebrow, "Really? I'd go: Kill Akagi, bang Katsuragi, marry Soryu."

"Soryu? Are you serious?" Hyuga asked, "Did you see the way she talked to her kid? She's a total ice queen."
“惣流？你认真的？”日向问，“你没看到她怎么对那孩子的吗？她完全是个冰山女王。”

Maya nodded.
摩耶点头。

"Come guys, she's just misunderstood. You guys see ice queen, I see tortured soul." He leaned back. "Besides, all she needs is a little fire to melt that heart of hers."  
"来吧伙计们，她只是被误解了。你们看到的是冰山美人，我看到的是受创的灵魂。" 他向后靠了靠。"再说了，她需要的只是一点火花来融化她的心。"

Hyuga shook his head, "You're hopeless."  
日向摇了摇头，"你真是无可救药。"

"Also, I got a thing for blondes."  
"还有，我喜欢金发女郎。"

"Yup." Hyuga nodded to himself, "There it is."  
"嗯。" 日向自顾自地点点头，"就在那儿。"

"And I mean real blondes, I can smell hair dye from a mile away."  
"我说的是真正的金发，我隔着一英里都能闻到染发的味道。"

Maya leaned towards the two, "When you said Akagi, do you mean Naoko or Ritsuko?"  
真嗣向两人靠近，"你们提到赤木，是指直子还是律子？"

"The Commander?" Aoba's voice cracked as his nose wrinkled, "The Boss? She's like fifty. Now that's gross."  
"指挥官？" 青叶的声音嘶哑，鼻子皱了起来，"老板？她都五十岁了。那可真恶心。"

"O-oh." Maya blinked and raised her three fingers, "In that case-"  
"哦-哦。" 真矢眨了眨眼，举起三根手指，"那样的话——"

"-Hey, you don't have to play if you don't want to." Hyuga offered.  
"——嘿，如果你不想玩，可以不玩。" 速水提议道。"

Aoba nodded, "Yeah, we can do a guys version if you want." His eyes widened, "N-not with us of course."  
青叶点头道，“嗯，如果你愿意，我们可以做个男生版。”他的眼睛突然睁大，“当然，不是我们俩。”

"Right." Maya's eyes widened in realization.  
“对。”麻耶的眼睛因领悟而睁大。

"_Won't you take me to… funky town!"_  
"难道你不带我去……放克镇吗！"

"So, which guys?" Aoba asked.  
“那么，哪些男生呢？”青叶问道。

"Well." Maya pulled at her collar, "H-hey, wasn't that spear thing really weird? Like how does it even work?"  
"嗯。" 真嗣拉了拉衣领，"嘿，那长矛是怎么回事？感觉好奇怪，它是怎么运作的？"

Hyuga pushed back his glasses, "Well, apparently it's coated with LCL and has a neural-" his eyes peered. "-Hey… what happened to not talking shop?"  
日向推了推眼镜，"据说那上面涂了 LCL，还有神经——"他眯起眼睛。"——嘿…你不是说不要谈工作吗？"

"Uh… ah-" Maya scanned the bar and saw a familiar face, "Hey, isn't that the Chief of Security?" She pointed to a man at the other end of the bar. He sported long greasy black hair, a biker jacket and a navy blue dress shirt, topped off with a crimson tie. He flirted with a waitress. "Yama...What's his face?"  
"呃…啊——" 真嗣环顾酒吧，看到一个熟悉的面孔，"嘿，那不是安全主管吗？"她指向吧台另一端的一个男人。他留着油腻的长黑发，穿着皮夹克和深蓝色衬衫，系着一条鲜红的领带，正与女服务员调情。"山…他叫什么来着？"

Hyuga hid his face with his hands, "Ugh, god no... Yamagishi." His eyes widened. "Don't wave him over, don't wave him over-"  
日向用手捂住脸，\"呃，天哪，不要...山岸。\"他的眼睛瞪大了。\"别招手让他过来，别招手让他过来——\"

"Oy! Yamagishi!" Maya hollered loudly, her face beet red.  
\"喂！山岸！\"真耶大声喊道，脸涨得通红。

"N-no, don't-" \"不-不要——\"

"-Oy! Yams!" “哎！山药！”

Yamagishi's head perked up and turned their way. He flashed a toothy smile and walked towards them.  
山岸的头一抬，转向他们。他露出了一个灿烂的笑容，向他们走来。

"Dammit, Maya…" Hyuga said.  
"该死，麻耶…" 飒也说道。

"Come on, guys." Maya offered nervously, "He might be nice."  
"来吧，伙计们。" 麻耶紧张地提议，"他可能是个好人。"

Yamagishi leaned towards their table, in front of Maya, beer in hand. "Hey there, beautiful, how's it going?" He turned to Hyuga and Aoba. "Sup."  
山岸向他们的桌子倾身，站在真央面前，手里拿着啤酒。“嘿，美女，最近怎么样？”他转向日向和青葉。“咋样。”

Hyuga waved weakly at him, "Hey man…"  
日向无力地向他挥手，“嘿，兄弟……”

"Whatcha doin' in this neck of the woods?" He scanned her up and down. "I like your haircut."  
“来这儿干嘛呢？”他上下打量着她。“我喜欢你的发型。”

Maya looked down and brushed her hair subconsciously, "O-oh, thank you. Y'know, just us guys fooling around. We're just talking about girls. N-not me of course, just-" She looked at the boys to save her.  
玛雅低头不自觉地拨弄着头发，“哦，谢谢。你知道的，我们几个男生闹着玩。我们只是在谈论女孩。当然不是我，只是——”她看向男孩们，希望能救场。

"Yeah man." Aoba leaned in, "Don't snitch on us, but we're talking about the babes at work. Man, that Soryu, huh?"  
“是啊，伙计。”青叶凑近了说，“别告密，我们在聊工作中的美女。那个宗谷，嗯？”

Yamagishi grinned and nodded, "Oh yea."  
山岸咧嘴一笑，点头道：“哦，没错。”

Aoba looked up as he pictured Kyoko. "Just… those eyes, that hair…"  
青叶抬起头，脑海中浮现出杏子的模样。“就是……那双眼睛，那头秀发……”

"Hmm. She's fine." Yamagishi agreed and licked his teeth. "Real fine."  
“嗯，她很漂亮。”山岸赞同道，舔了舔牙齿。“真的很漂亮。”

"Yeah…" Aoba gulped his beer.  
“是啊……”青叶咽下一口啤酒。

Hyuga hummed in tentative agreement.  
日向轻轻哼了一声，表示初步同意。

Yamashi took a slow sip of his beer. "...Real mature for her age too."  
山科慢慢地喝了一口啤酒。"...她这个年纪，真是成熟得过分。"

Aoba spat out his drink all over the table and gagged.  
青叶一口饮料喷满了桌子，呛得直咳嗽。

"What the fuck." Hyuga said.  
"搞什么鬼。" 日向说。

"What?" Yamagishi looked at the group confused.  
"什么？" 山岸看着大家，一脸困惑。

"Kyoko Soryu, dude. We're talking about the Sub-Commander."  
"是苍龙教官，伙计。我们在说副指挥官。"

Yamagishi considered for a second. "I know what I said."  
山岸思考了一会儿。“我知道我刚才说了什么。”

"What the fuck!?" Aoba wheezed.  
“搞什么鬼！？”青叶喘着气说。

Maya's eyes widened as she clutched her head.  
真矢瞪大了眼睛，双手抱头。

Yamagishi crossed his arms, "It's legal here in Japan, isn't it?"  
山岸交叉双臂，“这在日本是合法的，不是吗？”

"She's a kid, dude. A kid." Hyuga said sternly. "Y-you better stay away from her."  
“她还是个孩子，伙计。一个孩子。”日向严厉地说道，“你最好离她远点。”

The jovial smile of Yamagishi's face only grew wider. "Yeah? I should?"  
山岸脸上的愉快笑容愈发扩大，“是吗？我应该？”

Hyuga felt a moment of bravery and stood up. "That's right."  
日向感到一阵勇气涌上心头，站了起来。“没错。”

Yamagishi easily towered over the shorted bridge technician. "Or what? What are you gonna do, little man?" He smirked and looked at Aoba, "Snitch?"  
山岸轻易地俯视着矮小的桥梁技术员。“不然呢？你能怎样，小个子？”他嗤笑一声，看向青叶，“告密吗？”

Aoba stood up and joined his friend. "We don't need to tell the boss. We can take this outside if you want."  
青叶站起身，与朋友并肩。“我们不需要告诉老板。如果你想，我们可以出去解决。”

Maya felt a surge of bravery as well as she stood up, "Y-yeah!"  
玛雅也感到一股勇气涌上心头，她站起身来，"是-是的！"

Yamagishi peered at Hyuga, who shrunk. He turned his gaze to Aoba, who didn't relent.  
山岸盯着速水，后者畏缩了。他转而看向青叶，她毫不退让。

He raised a hand at Aoba, but he didn't flinch.  
他向青叶举起手，但她没有退缩。

After a tense moment of silence from the whole bar, Yamagishi broke into a fit of laughter. "Ladies, ladies! I'm joking."  
整个酒吧陷入一阵紧张的沉默后，山岸突然爆发出一阵大笑。“女士们，女士们！我开玩笑的。”

Tentatively, Hyuga joined with a nervous laughter.  
小心翼翼地，日向也跟着紧张地笑了起来。

He patted Hyuga on the chest, who flinched. "Don't get your panties all up in a bunch. Just us guys fooling around, right?"  
他拍了拍日向的胸口，后者缩了一下。“别这么紧张。我们只是在闹着玩，对吧？”

Aoba nodded slowly, "...Right."  
青叶缓缓点头，"...嗯。"

Yamagishi sized up the group, "What are you guys doing after this? Wanna hang out?"  
山岸打量着众人，"你们待会儿干嘛？一起出去玩吗？"

"...Think we might call it after this." Aoba said. "It's been a long day."  
"...我们可能就到此为止了。"青叶说，"今天已经很累了。"

"Right, right… I hear that." Yamagishi chugged down the drink and left it on their table. "Stay out of trouble."  
“对对……我懂的。”山岸一口气喝完饮料，把它留在桌上，“别惹麻烦。”

With that, he walked out of the bar. The bar's music returned, along with it, the chatter.  
说完，他走出了酒吧。音乐随即恢复，随之而来的还有人们的交谈声。

The three slowly sat down, speechless.  
三人缓缓坐下，无言以对。

Maya let out a shudder.  
玛雅不禁打了个寒颤。

"_Won't you take me to… funky town!"_  
"带我去...放克镇！"

Hyuga glared at Maya, "I told you not to call him over!"  
日向瞪着真弥，“我告诉过你别叫他来！”

"How was I supposed to know!?"  
“我怎么可能知道！？”

---

"What are you, stupid?" “你是不是傻？”

His eyes meet the charred blue giant floating on its back in the crimson sea, helicopters, VTOLS and scientists in orange hazmat suits circle the gargantuan corpse. Like flies completely covering a corpse in the wild. There's two massive holes in the body, one in its throat, the other in its stomach. The splayed open ribcage blends in among the skyscrapers.  
他的目光与那漂浮在赤红海洋中、背部朝上的焦黑蓝色巨人相遇，直升机、垂直起降飞机和身着橙色防化服的科学家们环绕着这庞大的遗骸盘旋。宛如野外的苍蝇完全覆盖一具尸体。巨人身上有两个巨大的洞，一个在喉咙，另一个在腹部。敞开的肋骨架与周围的摩天大楼融为一体。

Asuka turns to face Shinji, her single eye sunken and face gaunt.  
明日香转向真嗣，她那只深陷的眼睛和憔悴的面容显得格外突出。

"Rei Ayanami's dead." "绫波零死了。"

"...Dead?" Shinji asked in disbelief. "What do you mean dead?"  
"...死了？" 真嗣难以置信地问，"你说的死是什么意思？"

"What do you think I mean?" Asuka pointed at Unit-00's body, which still floated in the crimson bay, surrounded by VTOLs.  
"你觉得我是什么意思？" 明日香指向零号机的残骸，它依旧漂浮在深红的港湾中，被垂直起降机环绕着。"

Shinji's eyes widened, "B-but… but, I was gonna-"  
真嗣的眼睛睁大了，"但…但是，我本打算……"

"-Asuka, that's enough!" Misato glared at her, "You know that's not true."  
"-明日香，够了！" 美里瞪着她，"你知道那不是真的。"

She snorted, "Oh, yeah. You're right. Totally. She's just walking around hunky dory after almost being cut in half. All she needed was some magic orange juice and-"  
她哼了一声，"哦，是啊。你说得对。完全正确。她只是差点被切成两半后还能逍遥自在地走来走去。她需要的只是一点神奇的橙汁和——"

"-Cut in half!?" Shinji exclaimed.  
"-切成两半！？" 真嗣惊呼道。"

Asuka whipped back and glared at him with her single eye. "Don't interrupt me, Numbnuts."  
明日香猛地转过身，独眼怒视着他。“别打断我，笨蛋。”

"I'm sorry, but I need to know!"  
“对不起，但我必须知道！”

Misato shook her head, "Asuka's just exaggerating. Shinji, I promise. Rei's okay. As much as I disagree with her mother, she is capable of some miraculous things."  
美里摇了摇头，“明日香只是在夸大其词。真嗣，我保证。丽没事的。尽管我不同意她母亲的某些做法，但她确实能做出一些奇迹般的事情。”

"Pfft." "噗。"

"Ms. Misato, please, what happened?"  
"美里小姐，请告诉我，发生了什么？"

Asuka groaned, "Didn't I just say?"  
明日香呻吟道，"我不是刚说了吗？"

"The Angel attacked early in the morning, it was a close call. But Asuka defeated it."  
"天使在清晨发动了攻击，情况一度十分危急。但明日香击败了它。"

"I… did?" Asuka shook her head, "Damn right I did."  
“我……真的吗？”明日香摇了摇头，“当然是真的。”

Shinji ignored her, "But Ayanami's okay?"  
真嗣没理她，“但是绫波没事吧？”

Misato nodded, "Like I said, it was a close call. Very close. She…" She sighed, "To be honest, she was clinically dead for fifteen minutes."  
美里点头道：“就像我说的，那次真是千钧一发。非常接近。她……”她叹了口气，“老实说，她当时临床死亡了十五分钟。”

Shinji stared at Unit 00's carcass, at a loss for words.  
真嗣凝视着零号机的残骸，无言以对。

"But she's getting state of the art treatment. NERV scientists are capable of healing non-fatal injuries with LCL treatment."  
“但她正在接受最尖端的医疗。NERV 的科学家们有能力用 LCL 治疗来治愈非致命伤。”

"That's such bullshit!" "这简直是胡说八道！"

Misato sighed and turned to her, "Speaking of, Asuka. I can understand why you don't want to see her, but you really need to get that eye looked at."  
美里叹了口气，转向她，"说到这个，明日香。我理解你为什么不想见她，但你真的需要去看看那只眼睛。"

"Oh, okay. We're just dropping the subject now? Glad to see things haven't changed." Asuka crossed her arms. "It's not like I have a choice anyways."  
""哦，好吧。我们现在就放弃这个话题了？很高兴看到事情没有改变。反正我也没得选。"" 明日香交叉双臂。

Shinji tentatively leaned in, "But I don't understand, if you don't want to see your mother, why don't you just say no?"  
真嗣试探性地靠近，“但我不明白，如果你不想见你母亲，为什么不直接拒绝呢？”

She whipped back again and jabbed a finger at his face. Asuka breathed through her nostrils. "Did I ask you!? Don't talk to me like you know me, because you don't. I mean-" She turned to Misato, "-This is the kid they're replacing her with? This… peasant? Seriously?"  
她猛地转过身，用手指戳向他的脸。明日香通过鼻孔呼吸。“我有问你吗！？别用那种你很了解我的口气跟我说话，因为你根本不了解。我是说——”她转向美里，“——他们要用这孩子来替换她？这个……乡巴佬？真的吗？”

"Hey…" “嘿……”

"For the last time." Misato rubbed her baggy eyes. "Nobodies replacing Rei." Asuka stammered, she raised a finger, "End of story!" Misato said sternly.  
“最后一次了。”美里揉着浮肿的眼睛说，“没人会替换丽。”明日香结巴了一下，她举起一根手指，“故事结束！”美里严厉地说。

The car instantly grew silent. Shinji stared out the window, Unit-00 was now a blue blur as they drove past the highway.  
车内顿时陷入沉默。真嗣凝视着窗外，零号机在他们驶过高速公路时已变成了一片模糊的蓝色。

Asuka sniffed. She leaned towards Misato's radio to put on a song.  
明日香吸了吸鼻子。她向美里的收音机凑近，准备放一首歌。

"Midnight Door" by Miki Matsubara softly played, but it did not help alleviate any tension. This drew Shinji from his malaise, his eyes lit up. "Oh hey, I love this song! W-what kind of-"  
"午夜之门"由松原美纪轻柔播放，但这并未缓解任何紧张气氛。这让真嗣从恍惚中回过神来，他的眼睛亮了起来。"哦嘿，我喜欢这首歌！什-什么样的-"

Asuka's response was to increase the volume. Shinji took the hint.  
明日香的做法是提高音量。真嗣领会了她的暗示。

After another uncomfortable minute, Shinji dared to speak up again. "You beat that Angel, right? That's pretty-" Asuka turned the volume up louder."-Amazing!" He continued.  
又过了一分钟的不适，真嗣鼓起勇气再次开口。"你打败了那个使徒，对吧？那真是-"明日香再次调高了音量。"太惊人了！"他继续说道。

...

Misato awkwardly eyed the two teenagers through the rear view mirror.  
美里尴尬地通过后视镜打量着两个少年。

Hesitantly, Asuka lowered the volume and allowed him to elaborate.  
阿斯卡犹豫地调低了音量，让他继续说下去。

"That must have been really scary. I-I don't know if I could be that brave. I'm sorry that you had to go through that."  
“那一定很可怕。我……我不知道我是否有那样的勇气。很抱歉你经历了这些。”

There was that word again. Sorry. It grated Asuka's ears like torn styrofoam. She shrugged. "It's part of the job. If you can't handle that, maybe you should go home."  
那个词又出现了。对不起。它像撕裂的泡沫塑料一样刺痛了明日香的耳朵。她耸了耸肩。“这是工作的一部分。如果连这都承受不了，也许你该回家。”

She waited for him to shrink again.  
她等着他再次退缩。

"...I don't know if I can. Handle it, I meant. But I made a promise to protect Rei, and I'm gonna do it."  
“……我不知道我能不能做到。我是说，处理这件事。但我承诺过要保护丽，我会做到的。”

Asuka eyed him up and down, then turned back. She glanced at him through the rearview mirror. "What's she to you anyways?"  
明日香上下打量了他一番，然后转过身去。她透过后视镜瞥了他一眼。“她对你来说到底算什么？”

Shinji blinked. "I… don't know if I should tell you."  
真嗣眨了眨眼。“我……不知道该不该告诉你。”

"You speak really highly of her." Misato added, she glanced at him through the rearview mirror. "Afterall, the two of you just shook hands." She said teasingly.  
“你对她评价很高啊。”美里补充道，她同样透过后视镜看了他一眼。“毕竟，你们俩刚刚才握过手。”她打趣地说。

Asuka snorted. "Figures. Pervert's already in love." She laughed moridly to herself. "Hate to break it to you, but-"  
明日香嗤之以鼻。“果然。变态已经爱上她了。”她自嘲地笑了笑。“不想打击你，但是——”

"-No!" Shinji's eyes widened. "It's not like that!" His eyes lingered at Asuka before he looked down.  
“——不！”真嗣的眼睛睁大了。“不是那样的！”他的目光在明日香身上停留了一会儿，然后低下头。

Misato noticed this and clicked her tongue, "Ah, I see. He's already got eyes for someone else."  
美里注意到了这一点，咂了咂舌，“啊，我明白了。他已经有心仪的人了。”

This seemed to break Asuka from her mood, if only slightly.  
这似乎稍稍打破了明日香的情绪。

"Eh!?" Her shrill voice returned. "Who? Tell me!" She turned and stared at him. "Is it Horaki? Or Kirishima. It's Kirishima, isn't it?" She leaned into his face confrontationally.  
“诶！？”她尖锐的声音再次响起，“谁？告诉我！”她转身盯着他，“是洞木？还是雾岛。是雾岛，对吧？”她咄咄逼人地凑近他的脸。

He held eye contact. "Horaki? Kirishima? ...Who are they?" The two stared at each other for a moment before they realized how close they had gotten. A blush grew on their faces as they both found interesting parts of Misato's car to stare at.  
"他保持着眼神接触。“Horaki？Kirishima？……他们是谁？”两人对视片刻，才意识到彼此靠得有多近。他们的脸颊上泛起了红晕，同时找到了 Misato 车上的有趣部分来凝视。”

Asuka noticed Misato side-eye her with a smirk and grew even more red, "T-the fuck are you looking at?"  
"Asuka 注意到 Misato 斜眼带着一丝坏笑看她，脸更红了，“看什么看啊？””

"Oh, nothing. Just haven't seen that side of you for a while."  
"“哦，没什么。只是很久没见过你这一面了。””

"Tch." She looked at the passenger's mirror and ran her fingers along her eye, then her cheekbones. Asuka's fingernails dug into her skin, as if to fish something out.  
“切。”她看向后视镜，用手指沿着眼角滑到颧骨。明日香的长指甲深深陷入皮肤，仿佛要挖出什么东西似的。

Misato snuck glances at her do this while she surveyed the road. "I was really worried about you, Asuka. We all were. You shouldn't have just run away from the hospital like that.".  
美里一边审视着路况，一边偷偷瞥着她。“我真的担心你，明日香。我们都很担心。你不应该就这样从医院跑掉。”

"Well, If you were actually there you would've known I went home first." She glanced at Shinji, "But I guess you were busy."  
“好吧，如果你真的在那里，你就会知道我先回家了。”她瞥了真嗣一眼，“但我想你当时很忙。”

The lightheartedness of the situation went as quickly as it came. Shinji glanced between the two, unsure of what to say.  
这轻松的气氛来得快去得也快。真嗣在两人之间来回看着，不知道该说什么。

Misato looked up at a hill, and then at her watch. "You know what? Let's make a little detour before we go back to the Geofront."  
美里抬头望向一座小山，然后看了看手表。“你知道吗？我们回去地底都市之前，先绕个小路吧。”

"A detour?" Shinji asked, "To where?"  
“绕路？”真嗣问道，“去哪儿？”

She giggled, "Someplace very special."  
她轻声笑道：“一个非常特别的地方。”

Asuka groaned, "Oh God. Not this again."  
明日香咕哝道：“哦，天哪。别再来这一套了。”

---

The three stood on a hill that surveyed the hidden Geofront. Shinji and Asuka shielded their eyes against the bright sunlight while Misato wore shades.  
三人站在俯瞰隐藏的 Geofront 的山丘上。真嗣和明日香用手遮挡着刺眼的阳光，而美里则戴着墨镜。

It was quiet, save for the incessant cicadas and the calls of distant, lonesome sea birds.  
四周一片寂静，除了不绝于耳的蝉鸣和远处孤独海鸟的叫声。

"Well?" Misato asked. "What do you think?"  
“那么？”美里问道，“你怎么看？”

Shinji stared off to the distance, his brow furrowed. "It's kind of… empty and sad, isn't it?"  
真嗣凝视着远方，眉头紧锁。“这里有点……空旷和悲伤，不是吗？”

"Wow." Asuka said, "You must be fun at parties."  
"哇。" 明日香说，"你在派对上一定很有趣。"

Misato glanced at her watch. "Look, it's time!"  
美里瞥了一眼手表。“看，时间到了！”

Shinji tilted his head, "Time for what?"  
真嗣歪着头，“什么时间？”

"Oh, look out." Asuka crossed her arms. "She's gonna give you the speech."  
“哦，小心点。”明日香交叉双臂。“她要给你做演讲了。”

"Asuka…." “明日香……”

Alarm horns rang loudly, despite it's distance, it was still enough to warrant Shinji to shield his ears, while the girls were desensitized.  
警报声虽远，却响亮得足以让真嗣捂住耳朵，而女孩们对此已习以为常。

Followed by massive barriers, sky scrapers erected in an attempt to reach the sky as sparks flew from the crevice. An entire city hidden, now proudly displayed.  
随后是巨大的屏障，摩天大楼拔地而起，试图触及天空，裂缝中火花四溅。整个城市曾被隐藏，如今自豪地展现。

Shinji's jaw hung. "Oh, man…"  
真嗣的下巴掉了下来。“哦，天哪……”

"Pfft. Don't cream your pants, new kid." Asuka snorted. "It's not that impressive."  
“噗。别激动得尿裤子了，新来的。”明日香嗤之以鼻。“没那么了不起。”

"This city…" Misato began.  
“这座城市……”美里开始说道。

"See?" Asuka said. "There she goes."  
"看吧？" 明日香说道，"她走了。"

Misato ignored her, "...Is a fortress built to fight back against the Angels. This is Tokyo-03." She turned to Shinji and offered a smile, "And it's yours now too, kiddo." She turned to Asuka, "It's the one that you and Rei defended, Asuka. Your city."  
美里无视了她，"...是一座为了对抗使徒而建的要塞。这里是东京-03。" 她转向真嗣，露出微笑，"现在也是你的了，孩子。" 她转向明日香，"这是你和丽守护过的城市，明日香。你的城市。"

Asuka rolled her eye. "Spare me, can we just go home now?"  
明日香翻了个白眼。"省省吧，我们现在能回家了吗？"

"Home… Right." Misato looked down, "Asuka, I've been meaning to ask you-"  
"家……对。" 美里低头说道，"明日香，我一直想问你——"

"-What?" "-什么？"

"Shinji's going to move in with me, and I was... wondering if you wanted to join us. To live with me again."  
"真嗣要搬来和我一起住，我...在想你是否愿意再次加入我们。重新和我一起生活。"

She blinked. "Really? You mean it?"  
她眨了眨眼。"真的吗？你是认真的？"

"Yeah, I do." Misato offered a weary smile, "I'd love to have you back."  
"是的，我是认真的。"美里露出一丝疲惫的微笑，"我很高兴你能回来。"

Asuka looked down, "It's just…"  
明日香低头说道，“只是……”

Misato's chest tightened, "Yeah?"  
美里感到胸口一紧，“嗯？”

She looked back up, "Sure I wouldn't be a burden?"  
她再次抬头，“我确定不会成为负担吗？”

The optimism in Misato's eyes faded, her shoulders slumped.  
美里眼中的乐观光芒逐渐消退，她的肩膀也随之垂下。

"Yeah. That's what I thought." Asuka walked back to the car.  
“是啊。我也这么想。”明日香走回车旁。

Shinji looked between the two, confused, "What do you mean? Of course you wouldn't be a burden-"  
真嗣在两人之间来回看着，困惑地问：“你是什么意思？当然你不会是个负担——”

"-Shinji." Misato said bitterly, "Please, just drop it."  
"-真嗣。" 美里苦涩地说，"求你了，别再提了。"

---

The ride back to the Geofront was silent, unbearably so. Shinji snuck glances at Asuka as she frequently touched her face and inspected herself in the mirror.  
返回地底空間的途中一片寂静，令人难以忍受。真嗣偷偷瞥向明日香，她不时触摸自己的脸颊，对着镜子仔细打量自己。

The conveyor lift inside of Central Dogma wasn't any better, or the elevator ride.  
中央教条区内的传送带升降机也好不到哪儿去，电梯里的气氛同样压抑。

And now, the long walk to the hallway towards Naoko's office.  
而现在，是通往直子办公室那条长长的走廊。

Shinji had left his personal belongings in Misato's alpine, but he carried his backpack that contained the ridiculously dense combination of an orientation package and contract on both shoulders, strapped tightly.  
真嗣将自己的私人物品留在了美里的小屋，但他双肩紧挎着背包，里面装着那份异常厚重的组合文件——新生指南和合同。

Misato seemed so tired that she could barely walk in a straight line with her high heels on.  
美里看起来疲惫至极，穿着高跟鞋几乎连直线都走不稳。

Meanwhile, Asuka worked tirelessly to brush the crusted LCL out of her hair and mend her disheveled appearance.  
与此同时，明日香不遗余力地梳理着头发上干结的 LCL，努力修复自己凌乱的外表。

Misato attempted to spark conversation. "That's it, I'm moving to boots."  
美里试图挑起话题。"就这样，我要转去穿靴子了。"

"You should try getting some gel insoles," Shinji offered as he pointed to his sneakers. "I never leave home without them!"  
“你可以试试用凝胶鞋垫，”真嗣指着自己的运动鞋提议道，“我出门从不离身！”

Misato blinked. "...Huh."  
美里眨了眨眼。“……哈？”

Asuka rubbed the bridge of her nose, "Jesus Christ, new kid. You're such a dork."  
明日香揉了揉鼻梁，"天哪，新来的。你真是个呆子。"

"What?" "什么？"

The clicking of shoes came from the back of the three's heads. "Asuka!" Maya Ibuki called out as she jogged towards them. She shared the same sunken bags that hung on Misato's eyes, however, she was pale.  
三人身后传来了鞋跟敲击地面的声音。"明日香！"伊吹玛雅喊着，小跑向他们。她眼下的黑眼圈和美里一样深，但脸色苍白。

"Hey Ibuki…" "嘿，伊吹……"

Maya stopped in front of them, "Asuka, thank goodness you're okay! I was so worried-" She scanned her face, "-Why haven't you had your eye looked at yet?"  
玛雅停在她们面前，“明日香，谢天谢地你没事！我担心死了——”她打量着她的脸，“你的眼睛怎么还没去看医生？”

"Oh great, you too? Would it kill everyone to just-" Asuka noticed someone waited for them at the far end of the Commander's office. "-Please give me a moment? Once I'm done talking to the boss I'll get right to it." She offered Maya a smile, "I appreciate your concern, Ms. Ibuki."  
"哦，连你也这样？难道大家就不能简单点——" 明日香注意到指挥官办公室的另一头有人等着他们。"-请稍等一下好吗？我和上司谈完就马上处理。" 她向真希波微笑道，"谢谢你的关心，伊吹小姐。"

She blinked, taken aback, as was Shinji and Misato.  
她眨了眨眼，感到意外，真嗣和美里也是如此。

"Of course Asuka. Your health should come first, but I understand." Maya said. "I just wanted to say that we were all very grateful for what you did." She pumped her fists in exaggerated gusto, "It's not everyday someone saves the world!"  
“当然，明日香。你的健康应该放在首位，但我理解。”真希说，“我只是想说，我们都对你所做的一切非常感激。”她夸张地挥舞着拳头，“不是每天都有人拯救世界的！”

Asuka smiled again, "Thank you. All in a day's work, right?"  
明日香再次微笑，“谢谢。都是日常工作，对吧？”

She nodded slowly before turning her attention to Shinji. "And you must be Mr. Ikari!" Maya offered her hand.  
她缓缓点头，然后将注意力转向真嗣。“那你一定是碇君了！”真希伸出手。

"This is Maya Ibuki, Shinji." Misato said, "One of our crew technicians, she'll be your eyes and ears on the field."  
"这是真希波·真理·伊吹，真嗣。"美里说，"我们团队的技术人员之一，她将在现场为你提供情报支持。"

"Oh." Shinji beamed and returned the handshake. Despite her gentle demeanor, her handshake was firm, as though it radiated a hidden strength that reassured him. "It's nice to meet you!"  
"哦。" 真嗣露出笑容并回握了手。尽管她举止温柔，但握手坚定有力，仿佛传递着一种隐藏的力量，让他感到安心。"很高兴见到你！"

Maya nodded, "Likewise." She looked at Asuka, blinked and turned her attention to Misato. "Captain, are you busy right now? There's something I need to talk to you about. Something urgent."  
真希波点头道："彼此彼此。"她看了看明日香，眨了眨眼，然后将注意力转向美里。"队长，你现在忙吗？我有件事需要和你谈谈。很紧急。"

Misato rubbed the back of her head. "Can it wait? I was suppose to touch base with-"  
美里揉了揉后脑勺。“能等一下吗？我本来应该和——”

"Oh, that's okay, Misato!" Naoko called from the other end of the hall, "Why don't you deal with that first and then we'll have a chat after I'm done with Shinji and Asuka?"  
“哦，没关系，美里！”直子从走廊另一头喊道，“你先处理那边的事，然后等我搞定真嗣和明日香，我们再聊？”

She nodded, "Right." Misato turned to the kids. "Want to meet me at the parking lot after you're done?"  
她点点头，“好的。”美里转向孩子们。“你们结束后想在停车场见我吗？”

Shinji smiled, "Sounds good!"  
真嗣微笑着说：“听起来不错！”

"Absolutely." Asuka said.  
“当然。”明日香说道。

Maya motioned her away from the kids and leaned in close as they walked. "So, what was it you wanted to talk to me about?" Misato asked.  
玛雅示意她远离孩子们，并靠近她边走边说。“那么，你想跟我谈些什么呢？”美里问道。

He knew better than to eavesdrop, but Shinji couldn't help but try to overhear, something about the Chief of-  
他本不该偷听，但真嗣还是忍不住试图听清，似乎是关于首席的——

"There's our pilot of the hour!" Naoko exclaimed.  
“我们的飞行员来了！”直子兴奋地喊道。

Asuka fidgeted with her hair.  
明日香摆弄着她的头发。

"Shinji! So glad that you decided to join us!" She waved them over. "Come on, there's someone I want you to meet before we talk shop. You too, honey!"  
"真嗣！很高兴你决定加入我们！" 她向他们挥手示意。"快来，在我们谈正事之前，我想让你见个人。亲爱的，你也来！"

He began to stroll over when Asuka brushed his shoulder roughly as they walked down the hall and out paced Shinji. Naoko led her inside.  
他开始走过去，但明日香在走廊上粗鲁地擦过他的肩膀，快步超过了真嗣。直子领着她进了房间。

Asuka froze at the door frame for a moment before she walked into the Commander's office..  
明日香在门框前僵住了一会儿，然后才走进指挥官的办公室。

---

Shinji stared in an odd mix of confusion and disbelief as Rei Ayanami slowly crunched on a strip of bacon. Just thirty minutes ago, he was told how she was nearly cut in half, clinically dead for fifteen minutes, might never walk again and now-  
真嗣带着一种混杂着困惑和难以置信的奇怪表情盯着绫波零慢慢地咀嚼着一条培根。就在三十分钟前，他还被告知她几乎被切成两半，临床上已经死亡了十五分钟，可能再也无法行走，而现在——

"Are you okay, guys?" Naoko asked.  
"你们还好吗，大家？" 直子问道。

He perked up, "Hmm?" 他精神一振，"嗯？"

"It's just that… you've hardly touched your food."  
"只是……你几乎没动你的食物。"

Shinji looked down at his bacon and eggs, then at Asuka, who stared across at Rei with a laser focus. Her lips firmly pressed together and her single eye wide.  
真嗣低头看了看他的培根和鸡蛋，然后看向明日香，她正用激光般的专注力盯着对面的丽。她的嘴唇紧闭，一只眼睛睁得大大的。

"O-oh. Well, Misato took us out for burgers on the way here."  
"哦-哦。嗯，美里在来这里的路上带我们去吃了汉堡。"

"Really? Burgers?" "真的？汉堡？"

"A-and I guess chicken nuggets too-"  
“还、还有我想鸡块也行——”

Naoko shook her head, "Such an unhealthy thing to eat first thing in the morning." She sighed and sat up. "Oh well, I suppose I'll wrap it up and save it for lunch-"  
直子摇了摇头，“一大早就吃这么不健康的东西。”她叹了口气，坐起身来。“算了，我想我还是打包留到午饭时再吃——”

Asuka began to wolf down the food, "Mm! It's really good, Naoko!"  
明日香开始狼吞虎咽地吃着食物，"嗯！真的很好吃，直子！"

She covered her mouth and sat back down, "Oh my! You sure are one growing girl!" She looked at Shinji, "Do you still want me to...?"  
她捂住嘴，重新坐下，“哎呀！你真是个正在长身体的孩子！”她看向真嗣，“你还想让我……？”

He shook his head, "Oh no, it's okay, I'm still hungry." Shinji took a bite of the scrambled eggs, "I like the mix you put here. That's sour cream, right?"  
他摇摇头，“哦不，没关系，我还饿着呢。”真嗣咬了一口炒蛋，“我喜欢你这里的搭配。那是酸奶油，对吧？”

Naoko smiled, "I'm so glad you noticed!" She took a bite of her own and slowly chewed. "I know, bacon and then sausages? But it's just such a good combination with the sour cream and the onions and the mushrooms…"  
直子微笑道：“我很高兴你注意到了！”她咬了一口自己的那份，慢慢咀嚼。“我知道，先是培根然后是香肠？但配上酸奶油、洋葱和蘑菇，真是绝配……”

"Mhm." “嗯哼。”

She eyed him up and down and smiled playfully, "But there's still something wrong?" Naoko prompted.  
她上下打量了他一番，俏皮地笑了笑，"但还是有哪里不对劲吧？"直子追问道。

"Yes." Instinctively. Shinji looked up at the oblivious girl on her right. "Ayanami, are you okay?"  
"是的。" 本能地，真嗣抬头看向右边那个毫无察觉的女孩。"绫波，你还好吗？"

"Yes. Why wouldn't I be?" She responded without a glance.  
"是的。我为什么不好？" 她没有看一眼就回答道。

"I heard what happened…" "我听说了发生的事……"

Naoko nodded slowly, "Ah, I can see why you're feeling a little upset then."  
直子缓缓点头，“啊，我能理解你为什么感到有些不快了。”

"More than a little, to be honest." Shinji looked down in an attempt to hide his irrational concern for what was in everybody else's eyes, a stranger to him. "I heard about your injury, how you were…does it still hurt?"  
“说实话，不止一点。”真嗣低头试图掩饰他那在众人眼中显得无理的担忧，对于他们来说，他是个陌生人。“我听说你受伤了，你是怎么……还疼吗？”

She looked down at her stomach, there was padding from the bandage, hidden by her white hoodie. "It stings. But my recovery was fast. I do not remember much."  
她低头看了看自己的肚子，那里有绷带垫着，被她的白色连帽衫遮住了。"有点刺痛。但我的恢复速度很快。我不太记得了。"

"I don't blame you, Rei." Naoko said. "It was a very traumatic experience. I'm just glad the two of you made it out okay. Oh!" She leaned to Shinji from across the table, "But you should have seen the two fight, they were amazing!"  
"我不怪你，丽。" 直子说道。"那是一次非常痛苦的经历。我只是很高兴你们俩都平安无事。哦！" 她从桌子对面探身向真嗣，"但你真该看看他们俩的战斗，太精彩了！"

Shinji smiled at her, then leaned towards Rei, "I heard from Asuka, but it must have been scary. I… hope that next time I can make a difference."  
真嗣对她微笑，然后向丽靠近，"我从明日香那里听说了，但那一定很可怕。我……希望下次我能有所作为。"

Ayanami stared blankly at him. "I was not afraid."  
绫波面无表情地看着他。"我不害怕。"

Naoko wiped her face with her napkin. "I'm sure you will, Shinji. But first things first, you need to be trained. You'll only be shadowing Asuka for the next encounter. For your safety." She glanced at her, "Speaking of, Asuka. I'm curious." She rested her chin on her fist, "What did you tell Shinji?"  
直子用纸巾擦了擦脸。“我相信你会的，真嗣。但首先，你需要接受训练。下次你只需跟随明日香学习。这是为了你的安全。”她瞥了明日香一眼，“说到这个，明日香，我很好奇。”她用手撑着下巴，“你跟真嗣说了什么？”

She perked up and glanced at Shinji, then at Ayanami, then at the Commander. "I…" Asuka looked down at her plate.  
她精神一振，先看了看真嗣，又看了看绫波，最后看向司令官。“我……”明日香低头看着自己的盘子。

Shinji took this as a prompt, "W-well, you said that she died, remember? That's why I was so worried. But it was probably just the stress of everything."  
真嗣抓住了这个机会，“嗯，你说过她死了，记得吗？所以我当时那么担心。但可能只是因为一切的压力。”

He was surprised when Asuka glared at Shinji through her single eye, before she turnt to Naoko and smiled, "Yeah, I don't know why I said that." She chuckled politely, unlike her previous mocking guffaws, "Probably because of that hit I took."  
他惊讶地看到明日香用她那只眼睛瞪了真嗣一眼，然后转向直子，微笑着说：“是啊，我不知道为什么会说那句话。”她礼貌地轻笑，与之前的嘲讽大笑截然不同，“可能是因为我挨的那一下吧。”

Naoko nodded, "Hmm, I can see why. Those things you had to see." She shuddered, "I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy." She looked down, "Oh… I'm so sorry kids."  
直子点点头，“嗯，我能理解。那些你不得不看到的景象。”她颤抖了一下，“我绝不会希望我的敌人遭受那种事。”她低下头，“哦……孩子们，我真的很抱歉。”

"Why are you sorry?" Shinji asked.  
“你为什么要道歉？”真嗣问道。

"I really don't want to have to put you kids through all this, but… they're not my designs. I'm afraid I didn't make the rules."  
"我真的不想让你们这些孩子经历这一切，但是……这些规定不是我定的。恐怕我没有制定规则的权力。"

"That's what I was wondering." Shinji continued. "Why don't adults pilot the EVA's? Wouldn't it be better that way?"  
"我也在想这个问题。" 真嗣继续说道。"为什么不让成年人来驾驶 EVA 呢？那样不是更好吗？"

Naoko sighed, "The truth is… my predecessors had very warped ideologies. The programming is irreversible. I'm simply working with what I have." She smiled, "But still, if they're is anyone up to the task it's you three! I couldn't imagine anyone else doing the job."  
直子叹了口气，"事实上……我的前辈们有着非常扭曲的观念。程序已经无法逆转。我只是在现有的基础上工作。"她微笑着说，"不过，如果有谁能胜任这项任务，那就是你们三个了！我无法想象还有其他人能做这份工作。"

"Oh, thank you! I'm honored to be here."  
“哦，谢谢！我很荣幸能在这里。”

She smiled, "Likewise." 她微笑着，“彼此彼此。”

The table grew silent, save for the clanking of forks and sips of coffee.  
桌上变得安静，除了叉子碰撞的声音和咖啡的啜饮声。

Naoko cleared her throat anyways, "As much as I love cooking for others, the real reason I brought the three of you here is because I wanted you all to get to know each other." She winked at Shinji, "What better way to build a team, right?"  
直子清了清嗓子，依旧说道：“虽然我很喜欢为别人做饭，但我把你们三个叫来的真正原因，是想让你们互相认识。”她向真嗣眨了眨眼，“还有什么比这更好的团队建设方式呢，对吧？”

"R-right." “对-对。”

"Why don't you start, Shinji?"  
“真嗣，你为什么不先开始呢？”

Naoko and the two girls looked at him expectantly.  
直子与两位女孩期待地看着他。

"Oh-" Shinji's face grew red, "Well, there's not too much to say about me. I'm homeschooled because I mostly look after my father-"  
“哦——” 真嗣的脸红了，“其实，我也没什么好说的。我因为主要照顾我父亲，所以在家自学——”

"-Oh, yes, Gendo." Naoko looked at Asuka and Rei. "Poor thing had a stroke and bit his tongue off in a hissy fit."  
“——哦，对了，源堂。”直子看向明日香和丽，“可怜的家伙，中风了，还气得咬断了自己的舌头。”

Ayanami nodded. "I see." 绫波点了点头。"我明白了。"

"That sucks-" Asuka perked up, "-I mean, I'm sorry to hear that. You sound like a dutiful son."  
"那真糟糕——" 明日香突然振作起来，"——我是说，听到这个我很难过。你听起来像个孝顺的儿子。"

Shinji took the comment as surprisingly genuine and smiled, "Thank you, Asuka."  
真嗣将这番话视为出乎意料的真诚，微笑道："谢谢你，明日香。"

"But, sorry, you were saying?" Naoko offered.  
"不过，抱歉，你刚才说什么来着？" 直子问道。

"Right, I, ah… I like to cook, listen to music and play the cello." He looked up at the ceiling, "Y-yeah, that's about it."  
"对，我，呃……我喜欢烹饪，听音乐和拉大提琴。" 他抬头望向天花板，"嗯，差不多就这些了。"

Asuka nodded as she chewed, "That's very interesting."  
明日香边嚼边点头，"那很有趣啊。"

Naoko turned to her, "Would you like to go next?"  
直子转向她，“你想下一个来吗？”

"Yes, Naoko." Asuka cleared her throat. "I'm an Evangelion pilot-"  
“好的，直子。”明日香清了清嗓子，“我是一名 EVA 驾驶员——”

The Commander leaned close to Shinji, "My star player at that." She giggled, "I'm sorry. I'm so excited, keep going, keep going!"  
指挥官靠近真嗣，“我的明星选手呢。”她咯咯笑道，“对不起，我太兴奋了，继续，继续！”

Asuka looked down and smiled bashfully, "I've been training for seven years." Her eyes darted to the side, "I like video games, braiding other girls' hair and playing with dollies."  
明日香低头羞涩地笑了笑，"我训练了七年。"她的目光飘向一旁，"我喜欢玩电子游戏，给其他女孩编辫子，还有玩娃娃。"

Shinji glanced at her disheveled appearance. The wrinkled yellow dress with mismatched socks, the oversize hoodie. The marks on her knuckles. "Really?"  
真嗣瞥了一眼她凌乱的装扮。皱巴巴的黄色连衣裙，不搭配的袜子，过大的连帽衫。她手背上的痕迹。"真的吗？"

"Yessir." “是的，先生。”

Naoko giggled, "You're so silly, Asuka." She looked at the messy outfit, "Maybe you should start with your own hair, yes?"  
直子咯咯笑道，"你真是傻得可爱，明日香。"她看着那身凌乱的装扮，"或许你该先从自己的头发开始，对吧？"

She touched her LCL crusted locks, "Right. Sorry, Naoko. I was under… a lot of stress. It won't happen again."  
她摸了摸沾满 LCL 的发丝，"对。抱歉，直子。我之前承受了……很大的压力。不会再有下次了。"

The Commander waved a dismissive hand, "Oh, don't be sorry. Why don't you worry about it after you've checked in with your mother? You really should get that eye looked at."  
指挥官挥了挥手表示不在意，"哦，别道歉了。不如你先去跟母亲报个平安？你真的该去看看那只眼睛。"

Asuka's lips pressed tightly together and she nodded, "Yes 'mam." She put her napkin on top of her plate, "May I be excused?"  
明日香紧紧抿着嘴唇，点了点头，“是的，女士。”她将餐巾放在盘子上，“我可以先离开吗？”

"Of course. Rei, why don't you give me and Shinji a moment alone too?" Naoko did a mime gag, "Lots of paperwork to do."  
“当然可以。丽，你为什么不也给我和真嗣一点单独相处的时间呢？”直子做了个模仿噤声的动作，“有很多文书工作要做。”

Ayanami sat up, "Yes." 绫波坐直了身子，“好的。”

Naoko clapped her hands together, "This is so exciting! I'm so glad the three of you finally met."  
直子双手一拍，“这太令人兴奋了！我很高兴你们三个终于见面了。”

The two girls stood from the table. Shinji glanced at Ayanami, "W-wait!" They halted. "We didn't get to hear from you, Ayanami."  
两个女孩从桌边站起身。真嗣瞥了一眼绫波，“等-等一下！”她们停住了。“我们还没听到你的想法，绫波。”

Ayanami looked at Naoko for approval. "Go on."  
绫波看向直子寻求同意。“说吧。”

The girl nodded and turned to Shinji. "I am Rei Ayanami." She looked at Naoko. "I like to read books."  
女孩点点头，转向真嗣。“我是绫波零。”她看着直子。“我喜欢读书。”

"Oh, what kind of books do you like to read?"  
“哦，你喜欢读什么类型的书？”

Ayanami considered for a moment before she glanced at Shinji. "Romance novels." The two girls walked out the door.  
绫波思索片刻，然后瞥了一眼真嗣。“言情小说。”两个女孩走出了门。

He stared at their vacant seats, the excitement he felt at making new friends replaced with a sudden, inexplicable sense of emptiness.  
他凝视着那些空座位，原本结交新朋友的兴奋感被一种突如其来的、难以名状的空虚所取代。

"I'm terribly sorry about Rei." Naoko said, "She can be… awkward."  
"我对丽感到非常抱歉。" 直子说，"她有时候…挺别扭的。"

"That's okay. I'm pretty awkward too." He chuckled as she switched chairs to sit closer to him. "I guess we have that in common."  
"没关系。我也挺别扭的。" 他轻笑道，她换了个椅子坐到他旁边。"看来我们在这点上挺像的。"

"I don't know about that." Naoko smiled, "You're just a late bloomer, that's all."  
"我不确定这一点。" 直子微笑道，"你只是晚熟罢了，就是这样。"

"O-oh." Shinji blushed, "If you say so."  
"哦，哦。" 真嗣脸红了，"如果你这么说的话。"

"Oh, I know so." There was a moment of silence before Naoko cleared her throat. "Now that formalities are out of the way, we can get to the paperwork. Blegh." She crossed her eyes. "Did you have a chance to read the contract?"  
"哦，我确实知道。" 沉默片刻后，直子清了清嗓子。"既然客套话都说完了，我们可以开始处理文书工作了。呸。" 她翻了个白眼。"你有机会看那份合同了吗？"

Shinji blinked, "Uh…" 真嗣眨了眨眼，"呃…"

"It was in your orientation package?"  
"这是在你入职培训资料里的吧？"

"Right. Ah to be honest-" Shinji rubbed the back of his head, "-This all happened so fast, I haven't looked at it since I was here yesterday. But that's okay, I-"  
"对。啊，说实话——" 真嗣挠了挠后脑勺，"——这一切发生得太快了，我从昨天来这儿之后就没看过。不过没关系，我——"

Naoko frowned, "That won't do. You should know what you're getting yourself into."  
直子皱起眉头，“那可不行。你该知道自己卷入了什么。”

"...Fair enough." Shinji ruffled through his pack and brandished the hefty paperwork.  
“……说得也是。”真嗣翻了翻背包，挥舞着厚厚的文件。

She pulled out her glasses, a librarian's type that framed her face nicely. "Now, let's start at page 42." Naoko cleared her throat. "The party agrees to commit to a schedule…"  
她拿出眼镜，是那种适合图书馆员戴的款式，很好地衬托了她的脸庞。“现在，我们从第 42 页开始。”直子清了清嗓子，“双方同意遵守时间表……”

---

Asuka's demeanor changed as soon as she walked out of Naoko's office. Graceful strides turned into stomps.  
明日香一走出直子的办公室，态度立刻变了。优雅的步伐变成了重重的跺脚。

Rei followed closely behind, despite Asuka's attempts to walk faster.  
尽管明日香试图走得更快，丽还是紧随其后。

She stopped, and so did Rei. "Just tell me one thing." Asuka said.  
她停了下来，丽也跟着停下。“就告诉我一件事。”明日香说道。

"Yes?" Rei stared at her blankly, almost cross eyed.  
“什么事？”丽茫然地盯着她，几乎要斗鸡眼了。

She already knew the answer as she stared at Rei's short stub of a ponytail.  
她看着丽那短短的马尾辫，心里已经知道答案。

Asuka hugged herself. "I need to know. You can lie. It's okay." She said softly. "...Is it really you?"  
明日香抱紧自己。“我需要知道。你可以撒谎。没关系。”她轻声说道。“……真的是你吗？”

Her breath shuddered as she attempted to hold eye contact with Rei, who blinked her dull, bloody eyes at her.  
她的呼吸颤抖着，试图与丽保持眼神接触，而丽则用她那呆滞、布满血丝的眼睛回望着她。

"Yes. Who else would I be?"  
“是的。我还能是谁呢？”

Asuka bit at her bottom lip to stop it from quivering. "...Nevermind." She turned and walked away.  
明日香咬住下唇，止住颤抖。“……没什么。”她转身走开了。

And Rei followed, "Do you wish for me to accompany you to your mother's, Soryu?"  
而丽跟在后面，“你希望我陪你去看望你母亲吗，惣流？”

The red head froze in place, her fists balled and chest tight. Asuka hung her head. "It's Langley. You know it's Langley." She speed walked.  
红发少女僵在原地，双拳紧握，胸口发紧。明日香低下头。“是兰格雷。你知道的，是兰格雷。”她快步走开。

"Yes." Rei continued to follow her.  
“是的。”丽继续跟着她。

Asuka stopped. "I just want to be left alone. Please, just…"  
明日香停了下来。“我只是想一个人待着。请，就…”

"Are you ordering me to leave you alone?"  
“你是命令我离开你吗？”

"...Yes." She said with a rasp.  
“……是的。”她带着沙哑说道。

Rei pondered this for a moment, before she looked back at her. "What does alone mean?"  
丽思考了一会儿，然后回头看向她。“‘独自一人’是什么意思？”

"..."

Asuka walked away. 明日香走开了。

And with that, Rei Ayanami understood what that word meant.  
就这样，绫波零明白了那个词的含义。

Unsupervised for the first time in her life, she looked around the cold, empty halls of Central Dogma, unsure of where to go.  
第一次无人看管，她环顾中央教条区冰冷空旷的走廊，不知该去往何方。

---

"Page 67-" Naoko pointed at the page with her pen, "-Now, this one's important: while a employee of NERV, I understand that I am in the non-pay status and that I am not entitled to to any benefits or privileges as a Evangelion pilot, to include, but not limited to medical care, liability insurance, death benefits-" She raised an eyebrow and looked down, her glasses slid down the bridge of her nose. "-Unlikely, by the way. I'm not sure why that's there. Anyways, education benefits, or disability retirement pay if I incur a physical disability. Are you following along so far?"  
"第 67 页-" 直子用笔尖指向那一页，"-现在，这一条很重要：作为 NERV 的员工，我明白自己处于无薪状态，并且不享有任何作为福音战士驾驶员的福利或特权，包括但不限于医疗护理、责任保险、死亡抚恤金——" 她挑了挑眉，低头看去，眼镜滑到了鼻梁上。"-顺便说一句，这不太可能。我不确定为什么会有这一条。总之，教育福利，或因我遭受身体残疾而享有的残疾退休金。你跟得上吗？"

"Huh?" Shinji was so tired that he could barely follow along with the menial jargon. "Yeah, yeah…"  
"啊？" 真嗣太累了，几乎跟不上这些琐碎的术语。"嗯，嗯……"

Naoko nodded, "Good, page 68…"  
直子点头道，"很好，第 68 页……"

Shinji looked at the dense paper and sighed. He noticed the corner of a photograph that stuck out of the package. Misato's lewd photo was still there, only a few pages away.  
真嗣看着那厚厚的文件，叹了口气。他注意到包裹里露出的一角照片。美里那张不雅的照片还在，只隔了几页。

His eyes bulged out of their sockets, "Uh, you know what? It's all right. I don't need to read the rest."  
他的眼睛瞪得溜圆，"呃，你知道吗？没关系。我不需要读剩下的部分了。"

Naoko raised an eyebrow, "You don't? Are you sure? There's very important information here."  
直子挑了挑眉，"你不要？你确定吗？这里有非常重要的信息。"

"N-no. It's okay." Shinji smiled, "I trust you."  
"不，没事的。" 真嗣微笑着，"我相信你。"

"...Are you sure?" "……你确定吗？"

"Yeah! You've been good to me, I really appreciate everything you've done."  
"嗯！你对我一直很好，我真的很感激你所做的一切。"

Naoko touched her chest, "Oh, Shinji…" She shook her head and smiled, "You have no idea how much that means to me." She flipped to the last page, "If you could sign here, here, here and… here, then you're all set!"  
直子轻抚胸口，“哦，真嗣……”她摇摇头，微笑道，“你不知道这对我意味着什么。”她翻到最后一页，“如果你能在这里、这里、这里还有……这里签名，那就一切就绪了！”

"Great." Shinji eyed the photo. He'd have to sneak the photo when she wasn't looking, Shinji reminded himself.  
“太好了。”真嗣盯着那张照片。他得趁她不注意时偷偷拿走，真嗣提醒自己。

She watched him sign himself away on the contract and beamed, "Welcome to NERV!" Naoko held the package. "I'll just scan this off, you're good to go."  
她看着他在合同上签下自己的名字，笑容满面，“欢迎加入 NERV！”直子拿着包裹，“我这就扫描一下，你可以走了。”

Shinji reached for the package, "Actually, could I hold on to the other stuff?"  
真嗣伸手去拿包裹，“实际上，我能先保留其他东西吗？”

"Oh? Why?" “哦？为什么？”

"There's just… some other things I wanted to look over, later. So I don't forget, y'know?"  
“只是……有些其他东西我想稍后再仔细看看，以免忘记，你知道的。”

"Pft." Naoko pointed at her temple, "Don't worry, I got it all up here, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask!"  
"噗。" 直子指了指自己的太阳穴，"别担心，我都记在这里了，有什么问题尽管问！"

He stared at her. Unsure of what to say. "I just really need to look."  
他盯着她，不知该说什么。"我只是真的需要看看。"

"Why?" Naoko's smile dropped. She flipped through the package, "What's in here-"  
"为什么？" 直子的笑容消失了。她翻了翻包裹，"这里面有什么——"

"-N-no! Don't!" "-不-不要！"

"Shinji, what did I say about-" She gasped and looked at the photo. "...Oh my goodness."  
"真嗣，我告诉过你不要——" 她倒抽一口气，看着那张照片。"...哦，我的天哪。""

He clung at his collar. "I can explain. It's just a joke. Really, Ms. Misato's not like that."  
他紧抓着衣领。"我可以解释。这只是个玩笑。真的，葛城小姐不是那样的。"

"I've known her for some time, Shinji. But this…" She scowled at the photo and took off her glasses. "This is unacceptable."  
"我已经认识她一段时间了，真嗣。但这个……" 她皱着眉头看着照片，摘下了眼镜。"这是不可接受的。"

Shinji bowed his head, "Please don't put her in any trouble. She's a good person, I-I can vouch for her."  
真嗣低下头，"请不要让她陷入任何麻烦。她是个好人，我……我可以为她担保。"

"You only met her yesterday, how can you trust-'' Naoko pinched the bridge of her nose, "-Okay. Okay… Don't worry, she's not in any trouble. But I still need to discuss this with her."  
"你昨天才认识她，你怎么能相信——'' 直子捏了捏鼻梁，"——好吧。好吧……别担心，她不会有任何麻烦。但我还是需要和她谈谈。"

The unsuspecting boy hung his head low.  
那毫无戒心的男孩低下了头。

"Hey." Naoko said softly, "Why don't you wait in the car, and I'll just have a quick chat with her about this." She winked at him, "Don't worry about it. I'll go easy on her."  
“嘿。”直子轻声说道，“你先在车里等我，我很快和她谈一下这件事。”她朝他眨了眨眼，“别担心，我会对她手下留情的。”

Shinji nodded slowly, "Okay. Thank you, Naoko." He stood up, "And for the food."  
真嗣缓缓点头，"好的。谢谢你，直子。" 他站起身，"还有食物的事。"

She beamed at him, "My pleasure."  
她对他微笑着，"我的荣幸。"

---

A cloud hung over Misato as she marched towards Naoko's office. The conversation she had with Maya and Aoba ran in a constant loop. "This creep really thinks he can pull this crap under my nose, with _my_ kid? We'll see about that, you greasy wannabe…"  
美里走向直子办公室的路上，心头笼罩着一片阴云。她与真希和青叶的对话在脑海中不断循环。"这个混蛋真以为能在我的眼皮底下耍这种花招，还牵扯到我的孩子？咱们走着瞧，你这个油腻的冒牌货……"

She found the door to The Commander's office already opened, but none of the children were present.  
她发现指挥官办公室的门已经打开，但孩子们都不在场。

Naoko waited on her desk at the farthest side of the vast, rune-etched office. Hands curled together as she stared blankly. "Took you long enough."  
直子坐在宽阔办公室最远端的桌前，等待着。双手紧握，目光空洞。“你来得真慢。”

Misato ran a hand through her hair, "I'm sorry about that, Naoko. Where…" She looked around, "Where are the kids?"  
美里用手捋了捋头发，“抱歉，直子。孩子们呢？”她环顾四周，“他们在哪儿？”

"Asuka is with her mother now. Shinji is waiting for you in your car."  
“明日香现在和她母亲在一起。真嗣在你的车里等你。”

"Oh… I see." Misato said, "It's probably better they're not here for this anyways."  
"哦…我明白了。" 美里说，"他们不在场也好，毕竟这事挺棘手的。"

"I agree." Naoko replied. "What did you want to talk to me about?"  
"我同意。" 直子回答，"你想跟我谈些什么？"

She sighed. The blinding morning light that shone from all four sides of the office burned into Misato's retina. The relentless lack of sleep and hangover begged for her to cut the conversation short.  
她叹了口气。办公室四面八方射来的刺眼晨光灼烧着美里的视网膜。持续的睡眠不足和宿醉让她渴望尽快结束这场对话。

"Where to begin?" Misato paced back and forth in the office, "Your Chief of Security. Yamagishi."  
“从何说起呢？”美里在办公室里来回踱步，“你的安全主管，山岸。”

Naoko raised her eyebrow, "Mako? Mako Yamagishi? I thought you wanted to discuss Kyoko."  
直子挑起眉毛，“真子？真子山岸？我以为你想讨论京子。”

"I know, I still do, but that can wait." Misato said.  
“我知道，我确实想谈她，但那可以稍后再说。”美里说道。

"Oh my, this must have been important then."  
"哦，那这一定很重要了。"

"It really is. He's been making comments about Asuka. Inappropriate ones."  
"确实如此。他一直在对明日香说些不恰当的话。"

"What sort of comments?" "什么样的评论？"

"Well, he said she's very mature for her age. And… well," Misato paused, She looked down. What was it that Maya said? "How she looks fine and…" She rubbed her head. "It sounded worse in person."  
"嗯，他说她这个年纪显得非常成熟。而且……呃，" 美里顿了顿，她低头沉思。真耶是怎么说的来着？"她看起来状态不错，而且……" 她揉了揉额头。"当面听起来更糟糕。"

"Were you there when this incident happened?"  
"你当时在现场吗？"

Misato shook her head. "No, but the person who told me about this said he seemed predatory. He was hostile to the other NERV crew."  
美里摇了摇头。"没有，但告诉我这件事的人说他看起来很有侵略性。他对其他 NERV 成员态度很不友好。"

She nodded, "That's not good. Who told you this? Maya?"  
她点点头，“那不太好。谁告诉你的？麻耶？”

Misato rubbed the back of her head, "No, but- to be honest, they asked to be kept anonymous. But they were very unsettled about the whole situation. It was more about what wasn't-"  
美里揉了揉后脑勺，“不，但是——老实说，他们要求保密身份。但他们对整个情况非常不安。更多的是关于那些没有——”

"Why would they wish to be kept anonymous?" Naoko asked. "I try to conduct a safe and open workspace here."  
“他们为何希望保密身份？”直子问道，“我这里一直努力营造一个安全开放的工作环境。”

"That's the thing, 'mam. They don't feel safe around him. And it's not just them either." Misato shuddered, "He gives me the creeps too."  
“问题就在这儿，女士。他们在他身边感到不安全。而且不只是他们。”美里打了个寒颤，“他让我也觉得毛骨悚然。”

"But, let me get this straight." Naoko stated. "You wish me to file a report on this, correct?" Misato nodded, "Okay, do you have any recordings, photos, emails, or proof that he said 'She's very mature for her age?' I want to help you, Captain, but frankly, I need more than he said/she said."  
“不过，让我搞清楚。”直子说道，“你想让我就此写份报告，对吧？”美里点头，“好的，你有没有录音、照片、邮件或其他证据证明他说过‘她年纪轻轻却很成熟’？我想帮你，上尉，但坦白说，我需要的不只是他这么说/她那么说。”

Misato moved to sit down-  
美里走过去坐下——

"Oh, don't worry, this will be brief." Naoko said, "I find this to be very odd." She sighed, "I've known Mako for almost nine years now, and he's never been anything less than a gentleman."  
"哦，别担心，这会很简短。" 直子说，"我觉得这很奇怪。" 她叹了口气，"我认识诚已经快九年了，他从来都是个绅士。"

"No offense 'mam. But how he acts towards you and how he conducts himself behind your back might be two very different things."  
"无意冒犯，女士。但他对你的态度和他背地里可能的行为，可能是截然不同的两回事。"

She looked down and considered this. "That's a valid point. I haven't considered how my employees might be behaving behind my back. I won't tolerate such behavior any longer." Naoko nodded, "I'll have a word with Mako."  
她低头沉思了一会儿。"这是个合理的观点。我还没考虑过我的员工在我背后可能的行为。我不会再容忍这种行为了。" 直子点头，"我会找诚谈谈。"

Misato sighed, "Thank you 'mam." At that moment, she wanted nothing more than to leave, her feet angled at the door. But one more topic ate into her mind. "There is one more thing."  
美里叹了口气，"谢谢您，妈妈。"那一刻，她只想离开，脚尖已转向门口。但还有一个话题萦绕在她心头。"还有一件事。"

"Yes?" "是的？"

"Asuka kept saying that Rei was dead. She insisted on it. I've known Asuka for eight years, I know when she's serious."  
"明日香一直坚称绫波已经死了。她坚持这一点。我认识明日香八年了，我知道她什么时候是认真的。"

"More like two, isn't it?" Naoko blinked, "Sorry, keep going."  
"更像两个，对吧？" 直子眨了眨眼，"抱歉，继续说。"

"It's just… still, it sounds strange, doesn't it? I saw Rei myself. She's okay."  
“只是……还是，听起来很奇怪，对吧？我亲眼看到了丽。她没事。”

Naoko nodded, "But you want to believe her."  
直子点头，“但你想要相信她。”

Misato looked down and considered. "Yeah. I really do."  
美里低头沉思。“是啊。我真的想。”

"Are you sure that's not you hoping to reconnect with her?"  
"你确定那不是你希望与她重修旧好的愿望在作祟吗？"

"Well-" "嗯——"

"-Remember." Naoko said. "She had a head injury, an untreated one. You saw her earlier."  
"——记住。" 直子说。"她头部受了伤，未经治疗的伤。你之前见过她的。"

"I know. But still-" "我知道。但还是——"

"-It's strange." Naoko nodded to herself, "It certainly is."  
"——很奇怪。" 直子自言自语地点点头，"确实如此。"

She looked down, "And about Kyoko… something's really not right with her. I know she's your right hand, and she delivers results. But I feel like this is having a negative effect on Asuka's morale. She's hurting, Naoko."  
她低头说道，“关于响子……她的情况真的很不对劲。我知道她是你的得力助手，她能带来成果。但我感觉这对明日香的情绪产生了负面影响。她在痛苦，直子。”

"I see." Naoko simply stated. "You're saying the presence of a neglectful parent is having a damaging impact on the children?"  
"我明白了。" 直子简单地陈述道，"你是说，一个疏忽大意的父母的存在正在对孩子产生负面影响？"

"...Yes. I guess so." "……是的，我想是这样。"

"And what do you want me to do about it?"  
"那你希望我对此做些什么呢？"

"I'm sorry?" Misato asked. Naoko stared at her blankly. That's when she noticed the color of the room was different. Red.  
"你说什么？" 美里问道。直子茫然地盯着她。就在这时，她注意到房间的颜色变了。红色。

It was blue yesterday. "She has no care for her wellbeing, so... As your Director of Operation, I'd suggest that she isn't allowed to have input on Asuka's duties on the field. I'd even suggest keeping her in the science division until her attitude changes and she can actually acknowledge her by her name."  
昨天还是蓝色的。“她对自己的福祉毫不在意，所以……作为你的运营总监，我建议她不应该参与明日香在战场上的任务。我甚至建议将她留在科学部门，直到她的态度改变，并且能够真正地称呼她的名字。”

"And who should replace her as Sub-Commander?" Naoko tilted her chin upwards, "You?"  
"那么，谁应该接替她担任副司令呢？" 直子抬起下巴，"你吗？"

Misato blinked, "No! I didn't mean that. I-" Her eyes darted to the side, "-What about Professor Fuyutsuki?"  
美里眨了眨眼，"不！我不是那个意思。我——" 她的目光飘向一旁，"——那副司令一职由副司令代理如何？"

"Kozo?" Naoko held back a smile. "I think I'd rather have you in that case."  
“高雄？”直子忍住笑意。“如果是那样的话，我倒宁愿是你。”

Misato stared at the Commander, speechless.  
美里盯着指挥官，哑口无言。

"Is that what you want? The job, I mean." Naoko shrugged. "Say the word, and it's yours."  
"这就是你想要的吗？我是说那份工作。" 直子耸了耸肩。"说句话，它就是你的了。"

She offered a nervous chuckle in response. "I…" Misato fidgeted with her sleeve. "I don't know if I'm qualified for that."  
她尴尬地笑了笑作为回应。"我……"美里摆弄着袖口。"我不确定自己是否胜任。"

"I see." Naoko clicked her tongue, "Well, as soon as you have any other solutions, don't hesitate to let me know."  
"我明白了。" 直子咂了咂舌，"嗯，一旦你有其他办法，随时告诉我。"

Misato nodded along. "I'm…I'm just really tired." She laughed, "I don't think I've slept since yesterday." Naoko continued to nod. "That's all 'mam. I'm sorry for being a bother."  
美里点头附和。“我……我只是真的很累。”她笑道，“我想我从昨天起就没睡过觉。”直子继续点头。“就这样，妈妈。对不起，给您添麻烦了。”

"Your concern is understandable. There's no need to be sorry for that. "  
“你的关心是可以理解的。为此道歉没有必要。”

She smiled back, "I won't keep you then."  
她回以微笑，“那我就不打扰你了。”

Misato walked to the far end of the ridiculously long office, the doors slid open and offered her retreat."Oh, Misato?" Naoko called out. "There was one more thing I needed to discuss with you, now that I remember."  
美里走向那长得离谱的办公室尽头，门自动滑开，为她让出退路。“哦，美里？”直子喊道，“我刚想起来还有件事需要和你讨论。”

She sighed and turned back. The Commander waited for her patiently at the other end of the office. Naoko beckoned for her to approach with a single finger. Misato put her hands in her pockets as she walked, "What's up?"  
她叹了口气，转过身来。指挥官在办公室的另一端耐心等待着她。直子用一根手指示意她走近。美里双手插在口袋里走过去，"怎么了？"

"Well." Naoko reached into her drawer and produced a folder, obscured from this distance. "By any chance, would you be able to explain…."  
“嗯。”直子从抽屉里拿出一个文件夹，从远处看不清内容。“你能不能解释一下……”

Misato peered as she attempted to focus on the image against the harsh morning light. As she walked closer, her heart slowly sank when she realized what Naoko was holding.  
美里眯着眼，试图在刺眼的晨光中聚焦那张图像。当她走近时，看到直子手中所持之物，心渐渐沉了下去。

The racy polaroid she jokingly sent to Shinji.  
那张她开玩笑发给真嗣的挑逗性宝丽来照片。

"...This?" “……这个？”

She neatly held the photo close enough for her to see the word's circled above Misato's cleavage: "_Look for these! ;)"_  
她小心翼翼地将照片举到眼前，足以看清米萨托胸口上方圈出的那个词：“找找这些！ ;)”

Misato's high heel boots wobbled as she attempted to stand still. She leaned closer to inspect the photo, despite the fact she knew well enough what it was. "Right. That's from my modeling days in college."  
米萨托的高跟鞋在她试图站稳时摇晃着。她凑近照片仔细查看，尽管她早已清楚那是什么。“对，这是我大学时做模特的照片。”

"Which is fine." The Commander stared at her patiently, like a disappointed parent would, "But what was it doing in Shinji's orientation paperwork? Did he steal it?"  
“这没什么。”指挥官耐心地盯着她，就像一个失望的家长那样，“但它在真嗣的入职文件里做什么？是他偷的吗？”

Despite her hangover and overall exhaustion, Misato knew better than to think this wasn't a test. "No. I had it sent along with the letter." She took her hands out of her jacket pocket, unsure what to do with them. "You know, as an incentive."  
"尽管宿醉未醒且疲惫不堪，美里深知这绝非儿戏。“不，我让人连同信件一起送去了。”她从夹克口袋里抽出手，不知该如何安放。“你知道的，作为一种激励。””

Naoko raised an eyebrow. "Incentive?"  
"直子挑了挑眉。“激励？””

"Well, well you know. I thought all this information being sent in at once would be a little intimidating for him. Out of the blue, he's asked to come to a train station to be picked up by a stranger and driven to a place he doesn't know." Misato let out a strained laugh as Naoko nodded along, unamused. "And the file said that he's an introverted, apprehensive type, so I thought…"  
"“嗯，你也知道。我原以为一次性收到这么多信息会让他感到有些压力。突然间，他被要求去一个火车站，由一个陌生人接送到一个他完全不熟悉的地方。”美里勉强笑了笑，而直子只是面无表情地点头附和。“文件上说他是个内向、多虑的人，所以我想……””

"I can see where you were coming from, and that you have good intentions, but this-" The Commander looks down at the photo, "-This looks bad. You had his home phone number, why didn't you just call him?"  
"我能理解你的出发点是好的，但这——"指挥官低头看着照片，"——这看起来很糟糕。你有他家的电话号码，为什么不直接打电话给他呢？"

"I tried to, but it always cut to static, this sort of strange gurgling sound-" Misato blinked, "-Which I think might have been his father. B-but I swear, it wasn't like that." Unable to stop herself from tugging at her jacket sleeves, she bawled her hands into fists, "Did Shinji give that to you?"  
"我试过，但总是切换到静电噪音，那种奇怪的咕噜声——" 美里眨了眨眼，"——我觉得那可能是他父亲。但，我发誓，不是那样的。" 她忍不住拉扯着夹克袖子，双手紧握成拳，"碇真嗣给你的吗？"

"How I received this photo isn't the issue." Naoko sighed, "But if you must know, he vouched for you. He said that you were a good person, and I want to believe him. I really do."  
"这张照片怎么到我手上的不是重点。"直子叹了口气，"但如果你非要知道，他为你担保。他说你是个好人，我真的很想相信他。我真的想。"

Misato slowly shook her head, "It was just a joke…"  
美里缓缓地摇了摇头，"那只是个玩笑……"

"I don't know about you Misato, but here at NERV we don't find grooming minors very funny."  
“我不知道你怎么想，美里，但在 NERV 这里，我们可不觉得对未成年人进行‘培养’有什么好笑的。”

"No! Of course-" Misato blinked, taken aback, "-Wait, grooming?"  
“不！当然不——”美里眨了眨眼，感到意外，“——等等，‘培养’？”

"That's what I said. You solicit him with an unnecessary, flattering invitation. Wear revealing clothing, now I'm supposed to just let you live with him unsupervised?"  
“我就是这么说的。你用不必要的奉承邀请他，穿得那么暴露，现在我还要让你无监督地和他住在一起？”

She began to panic as she felt her career crumble away, "I- I mean come on, it's not like I'm going to put the moves on a kid or anything."  
她开始感到恐慌，因为她的职业生涯似乎正在崩溃，“我——我的意思是，拜托，我又不是要对一个孩子下手什么的。”

Naoko's eyes widened, "Of course not! Why would you say something like that? Misato, I know, you didn't mean it like that, but that doesn't take away how serious this looks!" She said, there was a slight raise in the normally lax woman's voice, followed by a shrill laugh of disbelief. "You just asked me to conduct an investigation with one of my employees for misconduct and then right away, I found out about this. I'd appreciate a little self awareness from you, Misato."  
直子的眼睛睁大了，“当然不是！你为什么会这么说？美里，我知道你不是那个意思，但这并不能减少这件事的严重性！”她说话时，平时懒散的声音略微提高，随后是一声尖锐的、难以置信的笑声。“你刚让我调查我的一个员工的不当行为，紧接着我就发现了这个。美里，我希望你能有点自我意识。”

"You're not honestly comparing me to Yamagishi, are you?"  
"你不会真的把我跟山岸比吧？"

"Honestly, wouldn't you, if you were in my shoes?"  
“说实话，如果你处在我的位置，你会怎么做？”

"This is different…" "这不一样……"

"Why?" Naoko raised an eyebrow, "Because you're a woman?"  
"为什么？" 直子挑了挑眉，"因为你是个女人？"

Whatever retort Misato had planned was lost to her as she fought back the redness in her face, the exhaustion and humiliation an agonizing mix. "What he said was completely unprofessional."  
无论美里原本打算如何反驳，此刻都已消失无踪，她努力压制着脸上的红晕，疲惫与屈辱交织成一种痛苦的混合。"他说的话完全不专业。"

The Commander stared blankly, "Why don't you let me worry about what is and what isn't professional.  
司令官面无表情地看着她，"你不如让我来操心什么才是专业，什么不是。"

Misato looked down, "...I'm fired, aren't I?"  
美里低头，"...我被解雇了，对吧？"

Naoko didn't respond. The silence stood for an unbearably long time and clung to Misato's skin like a week old sweat.  
直子没有回应。沉默持续了令人难以忍受的长时间，像一周未洗的汗水一样黏附在美里皮肤上。

"No. You're not fired." Naoko finally said. She slid the photo back into the file and put it back in her drawer. "You came to NERV because you wanted revenge on the Angels for what they did to your father, right? I wouldn't deny you that."  
"不，你没有被解雇。"直子终于说道。她将照片滑回文件夹，放回抽屉。"你来 NERV 是因为你想为父亲向使徒复仇，对吧？我不会阻止你。"

She looked up at the Commander. Misato never expressed her true motivations for joining NERV to her, so how… either way, the relief that washed over her was elevating. "I understand if you don't want Shinji living with me either. I completely understand, what I did was-"  
她抬头望向指挥官。美里从未向她透露过加入 NERV 的真实动机，所以……无论如何，那种如释重负的感觉让她感到振奋。“如果你也不希望真嗣和我住在一起，我能理解。我完全明白，我之前所做的——”

"-Wrong again." Naoko smiled, "Despite this, I don't think there's anyone else more suitable to look after him. I'll give you a second chance. You want to prove that you're capable of looking after Asuka? Start with him, and I'll reconsider."  
“——又错了。”直子微笑道，“尽管如此，我认为没有其他人更适合照顾他了。我会再给你一次机会。你想证明自己能照顾明日香吗？从他开始，我会重新考虑。”

The roller coaster of emotions that flew through Misato forced her to fight back a smile, "Yes, thank you, Naoko. I won't let you down."  
情绪的过山车让美里不得不强忍住笑容，“是的，谢谢你，直子。我不会让你失望的。”

She nodded, stood up and shook her hand. "Oh, I know you won't."  
她点点头，站起身来握了握她的手。“哦，我知道你不会的。”

---

Asuka stared at the Kanji letters etched into the Sub-Commander's office and read the alien name with ease.  
明日香盯着刻在副指挥官办公室上的汉字，轻松地读出了那个异族的名字。

Kyoko Soryu. 绫波京子。

"Just get it over with…" She said to herself.  
“快点结束吧……”她自言自语道。

With trembled hands, she swiped her key card over a panel, and the door to the office slid open.  
她颤抖着双手，将钥匙卡在面板上刷过，办公室的门便缓缓滑开。

It was dimly lit, in fact, the only lights that came from the Sub-Commander's laboratory home were her computer monitors, and the vats of orange liquid that Asuka so despised. Light's were shone behind the vats, like an artificial sun set.  
房间内光线昏暗，实际上，副指挥官的实验室家中唯一的光源来自她的电脑显示器和那几缸明日香极为厌恶的橙色液体。灯光从缸后照射出来，宛如人造的夕阳。

Her biological mother sat at her desk, a small cot beside her, back faced away from Asuka.  
她的生母坐在桌前，旁边是一张小床，背对着明日香。

Kyoko's head lifted, but did not turn to look at Asuka. "Pilot Langley. Step inside."  
绫波的头抬了起来，但没有转过来看明日香。“驾驶员兰格雷，请进。”

Asuka looked down at the floor, the transition from the blue tiled floors of NERV were a stark difference to the lineless, messy metallic floor.  
明日香低头看着地面，从 NERV 的蓝色瓷砖地板过渡到这里，那种无线条、凌乱的金属地面形成了鲜明对比。

She took a hesitant step over the threshold, "I…"  
她犹豫地跨过门槛，“我……”

---

"...Guess I'm home, then." Shinji said as he strolled past the threshold into Misato's apartment, a bashful look on his face. He struggled to balance the many shopping bags in his arms.  
“……那我算是到家了。”真嗣说着，带着一丝羞涩的表情，跨过门槛走进美里小姐的公寓。他努力平衡着手中众多的购物袋。

Misato squinted into a smile, and squeezed every ounce of enthusiasm out of her body, despite visibly being on the verge of collapse. "Welcome home!"  
美里挤出一个微笑，尽管明显已濒临崩溃，她还是竭尽全力挤出全身的活力。“欢迎回家！”

He beamed, "Thank you for having me-" He tripped on a bag of empty beer cans.  
他笑着说：“谢谢邀请我——” 结果被一袋空啤酒罐绊倒了。

Her eyes widened, "Shi- shoot!" Misato picked up the bag and made a frenzied attempt to clear the living room. She let out a nervous chuckle, "Sorry about the mess. It's a little cluttered."  
她的眼睛瞪大了，“哎呀，糟糕！” 美里赶紧抓起袋子，慌忙开始清理客厅。她尴尬地笑了笑，“抱歉这里有点乱，稍微有点杂乱。”

Shinji looked around, virtually every free space was occupied with empty beer cans, ramen bowls and litter.  
真嗣环顾四周，几乎每个空闲的地方都堆满了空啤酒罐、拉面碗和垃圾。

A little? 一点点？

The obsessive part of his mind begged him to scour this place spotless. "It's okay, I don't mind." Shinji pointed to the fridge, "I'll just unload the groceries." He couldn't help but notice the only contents in the fridge were beer, ice and snacks.  
他内心那股执拗劲儿催促他把这个地方彻底打扫干净。“没事，我不介意。”真嗣指着冰箱说，“我先把这些食物放进去。”他不禁注意到冰箱里除了啤酒、冰块和零食，别无他物。

Misato dropped the bag of recyclables and moved to the fridge to snatch the groceries out of Shinji's hands. "Don't even worry about it! Make yourself at home!"  
美里扔下那袋可回收垃圾，快步走到冰箱前，从真嗣手中抢过食物。“别操心了！随便点，当自己家一样！”

Shinji stood, his hands hovered in utter confusion towards the stark contrast of Misato's attitude. The image of her, and Naoko suddenly popped into his mind. "Ms. Misato?"  
真嗣站在那里，双手悬空，完全被美里态度的突变搞糊涂了。她的形象和直子阿姨突然在他脑海中闪现。“美里小姐？”

Her hands moved in a flurry to stock up the fridge, "Mhmm?"  
她的双手忙乱地往冰箱里补货，"嗯哼？"

"Is everything okay?" "一切都好吗？"

"Of course! Why wouldn't it be?"  
"当然！怎么会不好呢？"

"It's just-" Shinji started, Misato went back to work, "-Nevermind."  
"只是——" 真嗣开口道，美里继续工作，"——没什么。"

She glanced back at him, the bags under her eyes deep like bruises at this point, "Hey, don't worry about me. Why don't you get settled in your room, then we'll have some lunch?"  
她回头瞥了他一眼，眼下的黑眼圈深得像瘀伤，"嘿，别担心我。你先去房间安顿一下，然后我们吃午饭吧？"

Shinji's stomach protested at the prospect of having a third meal this early in the day, but his guilt from earlier and overall insistence to be polite overruled the stomach. "Right."  
真嗣的胃对这么早就要吃第三顿饭表示抗议，但之前的内疚感和一贯的礼貌让他压下了这种感觉。"好的。"

---

Misato pressed the cool beer against her temple. "Ah… that's nice." With a lick of her lips she cracked the beer open and prepared to chug it. Her eyes met Shinji's and froze mid drink. "Sorry Shinji, I should have asked. Are you okay if I have a drink?"  
美里将冰凉的啤酒贴在额头上。“啊……真舒服。”她舔了舔嘴唇，打开啤酒准备一饮而尽。目光与真嗣相遇，她停在了半空中。“抱歉，真嗣，我应该先问你的。我喝点酒你介意吗？”

Shinji looked up from the table, "No, no. Go ahead.."  
真嗣从桌子上抬起头，“不，不。你继续吧..”

"Well, in that case-" She whipped her head back and proceeded to finish the entire can in under ten seconds, followed by a shriek of pure satisfaction. She shed tears of joy. "-That's the good stuff!" Misato sighed and sunk back in her chair, legs crossed. "This is nice, actually sharing a meal with a person y'know?"  
“那么，既然如此——”她猛地转过头，一口气喝完整罐啤酒，不到十秒钟，随后发出一声纯粹的满足尖叫。她流下了喜悦的泪水。“这才是好东西！”美里叹了口气，靠回椅子上，双腿交叉。“这样真好，实际上是和人一起分享一顿饭，你知道吗？”

"Yeah, It is nice. It reminds me of being back home." He glanced at the beer can.  
"是啊，确实不错。让我想起了回家的时候。" 他瞥了一眼啤酒罐。"

"I see." Misato leaned in quizzically. She looked around the semi-clean room. Her attempt to clean was to shove everything in a single corner. "Your dad's messy too?"  
"我明白了。" 美里好奇地向前倾身。她环顾着半整洁的房间。她的清洁方式是把所有东西都推到房间的一个角落。"你爸爸也很邋遢吗？"

"Not that. Well I mean, he is, but I meant that Father likes to drink with his meals."  
"不是那个。嗯，我是说，他确实会，但我的意思是父亲喜欢在用餐时喝酒。"

She blinked, "Oh…"The two looked down, unsure how to continue the conversation. "I guess it's like you've never left home then, right?" Misato attempted teasingly.  
她眨了眨眼，“哦……”两人低头，不知如何继续对话。“我想这就好像你从未离开过家一样，对吧？”美里打趣道。

"I guess so." “我想是的。”

"Hmm." “嗯。”

Silence. 沉默。

They glanced back at each other, both flashed different looks of discomfort. Despite the sweltering heat, she wore full jeans and a yellow shirt, the same one from the picture. An odd, wide silver cross hung below her collarbone. Shinji could only hold eye contact in passing before he'd scan the contents of Misato's room.  
他们彼此匆匆一瞥，各自流露出不同的不适神情。尽管天气闷热，她却穿着长牛仔裤和一件黄色衬衫，正是照片里的那件。一个奇特的宽银十字架垂挂在她的锁骨下方。真嗣只能短暂地保持眼神接触，随即开始打量美里房间里的陈设。

Misato noticed this and offered a flat smile before she looked down as well.  
美里注意到了这一点，露出一个淡淡的微笑，然后也垂下了目光。

Finally, she cleared her throat and clapped her hands together, "Let's eat!" Shinji picked up the steaming ramen bowl and slurped it down. Misato let out a bemused laugh "Hey, hey, easy there, tough guy! You're gonna burn yourself. You're supposed to eat it, like this:" She scooped up a chopstick full of noodles and huffed away at the steam.  
最终，她清了清嗓子，拍了拍手，"开动吧！"真嗣端起热气腾腾的拉面碗，大口吸食起来。美里发出一声打趣的笑声，"嘿，嘿，慢点儿，硬汉！你会烫到的。应该这样吃："她用筷子夹起一束面条，吹散了热气。

"I don't mind it." Shinji said before he covered his mouth. "I cook a lot, so I've gotten used to hot foods and oil burns. The heat never really bothered me. Not even spicy foods."  
"我不在意这个。" 真嗣说着，用手遮住了嘴。"我经常做饭，所以习惯了热食和油烫。高温从来没真正困扰过我。即使是辣的食物也不怕。"

She raised an eyebrow, "Oh, really?"  
她挑了挑眉，"哦，真的吗？"

He continued to slurp at the noodles and avoided eye contact.  
他继续吸溜着面条，避免眼神接触。

Misato slammed something on the table which caught his attention. He looked up to see a bottle of Tabasco sauce, her face a devilish, exaggerated grin. "Care for a friendly wager?"  
美里猛地将某物拍在桌上，吸引了他的注意。他抬头一看，是一瓶塔巴斯科辣椒酱，她的脸上带着恶作剧般的夸张笑容。“想打个赌吗？”

"Mhm?" Shinji covered his mouth politely as he chewed.  
“嗯？” 真嗣礼貌地捂住嘴，边嚼边回应。

"Whoever finishes their spicy noodles first gets their picking of chores for the month. Sounds good?"  
“谁先吃完辣面，谁就可以挑选这个月的家务活。听起来不错吧？”

Shinji wiped his face with a napkin, he noted Misato's faltered grin. This wasn't a competition, it was a peace offering. "Ah, sure. If you want."  
真嗣用纸巾擦了擦脸，注意到美里勉强的笑容。这不是一场比赛，而是一种和平的表示。“啊，当然。如果你愿意的话。”

"Come on, quit being so agreeable! Only do it if you want to."  
“拜托，别这么好说话！只有在你真的想做的时候才去做。”

"R-right. Sorry, I do want to."  
“呃，对。对不起，我确实想做。”

She went for her beer. "And quit apologizing!" Misato let out a groan,"Bah. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry! Guys aren't supposed to be apologetic." She looked down, "...What have you even got to be sorry for anyways?"  
她去拿啤酒。“别再道歉了！”美里发出一声呻吟，“呸。对不起，对不起，对不起，对不起！男人不应该这么爱道歉。”她低头，“……你到底有什么好道歉的？”

He pressed his lips tightly together and looked down, "I got you in trouble today, didn't I?" Shinji briefly met her eyes before he opted to stare at her nose instead. "I swear, I didn't give her the photo. I didn't rat you out. I-I forgot it in my orientation package-"  
他紧紧抿着嘴唇，低头说道，“今天我给你惹麻烦了，对吧？”真嗣短暂地与她对视，随即选择盯着她的鼻子。“我发誓，我没有给她那张照片。我没有出卖你。我——我把它忘在了迎新包里——”

Misato gently waved her hands, "Wait." She looked up at him and held eye contact. "I should be the one apologizing. I know you didn't give her the photo, and even if you did, I shouldn't have sent it to you in the first place." Shinji slowly lifted his head. "I was trying to… to be honest, I don't know what I was thinking. I thought it would, y'know, break the ice. But adults should never do things like that."  
美里轻轻摆手，“等等。”她抬头看着他，保持眼神接触。“我应该道歉的。我知道你没有给她照片，即使你给了，我也不应该一开始就发给你的。”真嗣缓缓抬起头。“我试图……说实话，我不知道我当时在想什么。我以为那样可以，你知道，打破僵局。但成年人不应该做那种事。”

"I know you didn't mean it like that. You're a good person, Misato."  
"我知道你不是那个意思。你是个好人，美里。"

Misato fidgeted with her beer, she squeezed it on one side, then the other to reverse the dent. "Not always, Shinji. Not… always." She sighed. "I'm sorry for that. And for how I treated you yesterday. I was under a lot of stress and took it out on you."  
美里摆弄着手中的啤酒，她先捏了捏一边，又捏了捏另一边，试图把凹陷的部分翻转过来。“并不总是这样，真嗣。不……总是。”她叹了口气。“我为此道歉。还有昨天我对你的态度。我压力很大，把气撒在你身上了。”

"It's okay..." "没关系..."

"No, it's not. You just seemed so gung-ho at the time, so when you backed away at the offer, I was just…" She took a sip. "Not being fair. You didn't even know what you were getting into. If I was your age, I would've done the same thing." Misato waited for a response. Instead, Shinji stared at the Tabasco sauce. "Listen, if this is making you uncomfortable, I-."  
"不，不是的。你当时看起来那么积极，所以当你拒绝那个提议时，我只是……" 她抿了一口酒。"不够公平。你甚至不知道自己要面对什么。如果我是你这个年纪，我也会做同样的事。" 美里等待着回应。然而，真嗣只是盯着塔巴斯科辣椒酱。"听着，如果这让你感到不舒服，我——"

She was interrupted by a loud, unceremonious _squirt_ of the Tabasco bottle, which splattered all over Shinji's ramen bowl, and partially flew on Misato's shirt.  
她的话被塔巴斯科辣椒酱瓶一声不客气的喷射打断了，辣椒酱溅满了真嗣的拉面碗，部分还飞到了美里的衬衫上。

Shinji stared at her, wide eyed while Misato stared back, both speechless. He smiled meekly, and offered her the bottle.  
真嗣瞪大了眼睛看着她，美里也回望着他，两人都哑口无言。他怯生生地笑了笑，把瓶子递给她。

Misato scoffed, and flashed a smirk while she shook her head and snatched the bottle, "Oh, you're so on!" _Squirt._  
美里嗤之以鼻，一边摇头一边露出得意的笑容，一把夺过瓶子，“哦，你可真行！喷吧。”

He covered his mouth to hide a laugh at the sound of the flatulent bottle, _squirt._ "I-It sounds funny."  
他捂住嘴，试图掩饰听到瓶子噗噗声时的笑声，“听上去真滑稽。”

Misato smiled as she mixed the sauce into the ramen, almost mesmerized by how it circled back and forth. "Me and Asuka used to do this every month to wager who did chores." Her smile tightened. "I ended up with the laundry, every time."  
美里一边将酱料拌入拉面，一边微笑着，几乎被那来回旋转的酱料迷住了。“我和明日香以前每个月都会这么做，赌谁来做家务。”她的笑容变得有些僵硬。“结果每次都是我洗衣服。”

"I was wondering about that." Shinji whisked the noodles with his chopsticks, "If you don't mind me asking, you guys obviously have some history, she used to live with you?"  
"我正想问这个。" 真嗣用筷子搅拌着面条，"如果你不介意我问的话，你们显然有些过去，她以前和你一起住吗？"

She sputtered, "You know, for such a shy guy, you're quite the conversationalist."  
她喷了出来，"你知道吗，作为一个害羞的家伙，你倒是挺健谈的。"

"Sorry-" He cleared his throat, "I suppose I'm more used to listening."  
"抱歉——" 他清了清喉咙，"我想我已经习惯了倾听。"

"It's alright. I guess neither of us were trying to hide it." The ramel bowls were left ignored, "I was Asuka's guardian for a few years, me and K-" She blinked, "-My ex-boyfriend. But it didn't work out." Shinji nodded her, which prompted Misato to continue, "We just… young and stupid, way over our heads, thinking we could play house, we treated it like a game. So when we broke off, it just sort of-" Misato nodded, "-I'm trying to be better now. She's staying with a friend of mine."  
"没事的。我想我们俩都没打算隐瞒。" 拉面碗被晾在一边，"我曾担任过明日香几年的监护人，我和 K-" 她眨了眨眼，"-我的前男友。但后来分手了。" 真嗣点点头，示意美里继续，"我们那时…年轻又愚蠢，自以为是，以为能过家家，把这当成了一场游戏。所以当我们分手时，就那么自然而然地-" 美里点头道，"-我现在正努力变得更好。她现在住在我一个朋友那里。"

"But I don't understand. The Sub-Commander is her mother, but they live separately?"  
"但我还是不明白。副司令是她的母亲，但他们却分开住？"

"I guess in the Soryu family, living separately is the norm. It's difficult."  
"我想在惣流家，分开居住是常态。这很复杂。"

"Soryu?" Shinji tilted his head, "I thought her last name was Langley-" He blinked, "-Oh." He frowned at the ramen. "But family should stay together. You never know how much time you might have with someone. Even if it's difficult."  
"Soryu?" 真嗣歪着头，"我以为她的姓是 Langley-" 他眨了眨眼，"-哦。" 他皱眉看着拉面。"但家人应该在一起。你永远不知道能和某人共度多少时光。即使这很困难。"

Misato sub consciously touched her cross. "I couldn't agree more. But, if you want to tell her that, be my guest." The two looked down at their bowls, "So are we gonna eat or what?"  
美里下意识地摸了摸她的十字架。"我完全同意。但如果你想告诉她这些，请便。" 两人低头看着他们的碗，"那我们是吃还是不吃？"

Shinji perked up, "R-right!"  
真嗣振作起来，"对-对！"

"Ready… set… go!" "预备…开始…跑！"

He tentatively nibbled at the noodles, and gagged at the spice, while Misato chugged down the noodles about as fast as she did her beer.  
他小心翼翼地尝了一口面条，辛辣的味道让他差点呛到，而美里则像喝啤酒一样迅速地吞咽着面条。

Misato slammed the bowl down and let out a screech, not one of satisfaction like earlier, no.  
美里猛地将碗放下，发出一声尖叫，但这尖叫并非像之前那样充满满足感，绝非如此。

Victory. 胜利。

"H-hey!" Shinji stammered, "You said she won every time!"  
"嘿！" 真嗣结巴道，"你说过她每次都赢的！"

Smugly, she stood up and put her hands behind her back, "Yeah, and I've had plenty of time to practice." Misato playfully karate chopped his head, "Laundry-boy."  
她得意地站起来，双手背在身后，"是啊，我有的是时间练习。"美里俏皮地用手刀砍了砍他的头，"洗衣服的小子。"

Shinji, somewhat brought out of his shell, huffed. "Well the jokes on you, I love doing laundry!"  
真嗣稍微敞开了些心扉，哼了一声。“好吧，你这笑话可落空了，我超爱洗衣服的！”

Misato rolled her eyes, "Of course you do." She walked towards the calendar, her back turned to him. "How about: you get laundry and garbage. And I take care of dishes and cooking?"  
美里翻了个白眼，“当然你喜欢。”她走向日历，背对着他。“这样如何：你负责洗衣和倒垃圾。我处理洗碗和做饭？”

He slurped at the noodles, his voice muffled, "Can I get cooking too?"  
他吸溜着面条，声音含糊不清，“我也可以负责做饭吗？”

"Are you trying to say I'm a bad cook?"  
"你是想说我不擅长做饭吗？"

"No! I just- ah…" "不！我只是——呃……"

"Relax, I'm pulling your chain. Well. If you insist, you're the cook."  
"放松，我逗你玩呢。好吧。既然你坚持，那就你来掌厨吧。"

"Okay." He took the bowls and set them in the kitchen, " Do you mind if I use your shower?"  
"好的。" 他接过碗，放到厨房里，"你介意我用你的淋浴吗？"

Misato whipped her at him, suddenly very serious. "No!" She pouted. "Showers are forbidden."  
美里突然严肃地瞪了他一眼。"不行！" 她噘嘴道，"淋浴是禁止的。"

"O-oh, sorry-" "哦，对不起-"

Shinji was interrupted by Misato's tipsy giggles, "Ah, you're too easy! Of course you can use the shower! Where are we, China?"  
真嗣被美里醉醺醺的咯咯笑声打断，“啊，你太天真了！当然可以用淋浴！我们这是在中国吗？”

He let out a nervous laugh, "Right. Thank you for the food, by the way."  
他尴尬地笑了笑，“对。顺便谢谢你的食物。”

"Don't mention it, kid." Misato went back to scribbling on the white board chore list, "And… thank you, for-" She turned back to see he was already gone. From the bathroom, he hummed a depressing pop song.  
“别客气，孩子。”美里继续在白板上的家务清单上涂写，“还有……谢谢你，为了——”她转过身来，发现他已经不见了。从浴室里传来他哼唱一首忧郁流行歌曲的声音。

Misato blew at a loose strand of hair that hung over her forehead. She walked over to the fridge to grab another beer. Beside it was the kitchen sink.  
美里吹开额前一缕散乱的发丝，走向冰箱又拿了一罐啤酒。旁边是厨房的水槽。

Both bowls were completely empty. She peered, hand hovered over the beer before she could crack it open.  
两个碗都空空如也。她手悬在啤酒罐上方，还没来得及打开。

That didn't make any sense, Shinji looked like he couldn't stand the Tabasco sauce, so how did he drink it so fast-  
这说不通啊，真嗣看起来明明受不了塔巴斯科辣椒酱的味道，怎么喝得这么快——

She scoffed at the realization and smirked, "That sneaky-"  
她对这一发现嗤之以鼻，嘴角勾起一抹笑意，“那个狡猾的——”

A loud, effeminate screech came out of the bathroom, followed by a loud trill and splashing sounds. Shinji bursted out of the bathroom, a towel draped around him. He was bug eyed, "M-m-m-Ms. Misato! There's a weird chicken in your- ah!"  
浴室里传来一声尖锐而女性化的尖叫，紧接着是一阵刺耳的颤音和泼水声。真嗣裹着一条毛巾从浴室里冲了出来，眼睛瞪得大大的，“美里小姐！你家有只奇怪的鸡——啊！”

Pen-Pen pecked at his rear and made him leap, Shinji ran around the kitchen table, which triggered the Penguins' animal instincts and gave chase. It flapped its wings and waddled after the boy with a screech.  
Pen-Pen 啄了一下他的屁股，让他跳了起来，真嗣绕着厨房桌子跑，这激起了企鹅的动物本能，它开始追逐。企鹅拍打着翅膀，一摇一摆地跟在男孩后面，发出尖锐的叫声。

Misato followed the two, she cupped her hands, "He doesn't like being called a chicken!" Shinji slid and crashed into the pile of garbage, "His name's Pen-Pen! He's an arctic penguin."  
美里跟着两人，双手合拢喊道，“他不喜欢被叫作胆小鬼！” 真嗣滑倒，一头栽进了垃圾堆里，“他叫 Pen-Pen！是只北极企鹅。”

The penguin lunged at it's fallen prey and pecked at him further. "Pen-Pen! I'm sorry I called you a weird chicken!"  
企鹅扑向倒地的猎物，继续啄他。“Pen-Pen！对不起，我刚才说你是奇怪的鸡！”

"Wark!" “哇克！”

"What do I do!?" "我该怎么办！？"

Misato tossed him the beer, "Give him this!" It hit Shinji square in the cheek.  
美里扔给他一罐啤酒，“给他这个！”啤酒正中真嗣的脸颊。

"W-what?" "什-什么？"

"He likes beer!" "他喜欢啤酒！"

Pen-Pen didn't relent as he flayed the human intruder with his beak. "Pen-Pen, look!" Shinji waved the beer in front of his face, "What's this?" The Penguin stopped and eyed him wearingly, he sniffed the can. He snatched the beer out of Shinji's hand and cracked it open with a flipper. Shinji stared at the bird, utterly bewildered. "...Penguins drink beer?"  
Pen-Pen 毫不留情地用喙攻击着闯入的人类。“Pen-Pen，看！” 真嗣在他面前挥舞着啤酒，“这是什么？” 企鹅停了下来，用疲惫的眼神看着他，嗅了嗅罐子。他用鳍状肢一把夺过真嗣手中的啤酒，用鳍轻松打开。真嗣盯着这只鸟，完全摸不着头脑。“……企鹅喝啤酒？”

"No, no, he's genetically modified." Misato leaned in and scratched Pen-Pen's head, "See?" She pointed at Shinji, "Friend."  
“不，不，他是基因改造过的。” 美里凑近来挠了挠 Pen-Pen 的头，“看吧？” 她指着真嗣，“朋友。”

Pen-Pen squinted at him as he waddled away with a side eye, "...Wark."  
Pen-Pen 斜眼瞅着他，一摇一摆地走开，"...哇克。"

Shinji laid back on the pile of garbage, he looked down to realize his towel flew off during the chase. His face grew red as he used a garbage bag to cover himself with dignity. Thankfully, Misato didn't seem to notice or care. "I thought the Commander said employees aren't allowed to have pets?"  
真嗣躺在垃圾堆上，低头发现自己追赶时毛巾飞掉了。他满脸通红，用垃圾袋遮住身体以保持尊严。幸好，美里似乎没注意到也不在乎。“我记得司令说过员工不允许养宠物吧？”

Misato wagged her finger, "Pen-Pen isn't a pet. He's a roommate." She watched Shinji nurse at the welts, "Hey, don't worry about it. Who's gonna know?"  
美里摇着手指说，“Pen-Pen 不是宠物，他是室友。”她看着真嗣处理着瘀伤，“嘿，别担心。谁会知道呢？”

---

The voice was muffled amidst the endless chatter of the students. "Keita?"  
声音在学生们的无尽喧哗中显得模糊不清。“圭太？”

Loud. Everywhere he went, it was too loud. Never time to think, just do.  
嘈杂。无论他走到哪里，都太过嘈杂。没有思考的时间，只有行动。

"Hey, Keita?" “嘿，圭太？”

You'd think after you were nearly wiped out by an extraterrestrial invader, just a few kilometers from your backyard, that you'd want to get your family out of here. Evacuate. But they trust their mystery protectors, why would we need to fix something that isn't broken?  
你可能会想，在几乎被家门口几公里外的外星入侵者灭绝之后，你会想把家人带离这里。撤离。但他们信任那些神秘的保护者，为什么要修复一个没有损坏的东西呢？

Why was he even here? I don't even want to be here. I just did it for my-  
他为什么在这里？我甚至不想待在这里。我只是为了我的——

"Hey… Keita!" 嘿… 圭太！

Keita Asari perked up to look at who was talking to him. It was his co-pilot, Mana Kirishima, who stared at him expectantly. She blinked her glittering grey-green eyes at him and the room suddenly went silent, the chatters inaudible. He blushed, "Ah, sorry. I must have spaced out. What's up?"  
浅利庆太听到有人跟他说话，便抬起头来。是他的副驾驶雾岛 mana，她正期待地盯着他。她眨了眨闪烁着灰绿色光芒的眼睛，房间突然安静下来，嘈杂声变得听不见了。他脸红了，"啊，对不起。我一定是走神了。怎么了？"

She pointed to the desk on her left, "Did you hear what Lee just said?"  
"她指向她左边的桌子，“你听到李刚才说的话了吗？””

"Huh?" He turned to see their de facto leader, Musashi Lee Strasberg stare at him. Unimpressed, his chair was flipped in reverse, "Oh no, I didn't. Sorry."  
"嗯？"他转头看到他们的实际领导者武藏李·斯特拉斯伯格正盯着他。不以为然地，他的椅子被翻了个底朝天，"哦，没有。对不起。"

The chatters returned. 闲聊声再次响起。

Lee jabbed his thumb behind him. "That's him, the new kid. That's our guy."  
李用拇指指了指身后。“就是他，新来的小子。我们的目标就是他。”

Keita peered over his shoulder, in the centre back of the class was an average looking boy, he snuck glances at Ayanami and Langley, who sat at far opposites of the room. The boy hung his head low and slipped on a pair of earbuds. "Are you sure? He doesn't look like pilot material."  
圭太从肩头望去，教室后排中央坐着一个相貌平平的男孩，他偷偷瞥向坐在教室两端的绫波和兰利。男孩低垂着头，悄悄戴上了一副耳塞。“你确定吗？他看起来不像个飞行员。”

Strasberg snorted, "And you do?"  
"斯特拉斯伯格哼了一声，“那你呢？””

Mana tilted her head, "I dunno, he's kind of- '' She glanced to notice her fellow T•RIDEN•T co-pilots stare at her. She pouted and wrinkled her nose. "...Suspicious!" She hissed softly.  
玛娜歪了歪头，“我不太清楚，他有点——”她瞥了一眼，发现她的 T•RIDEN•T 副驾驶们都盯着她。她噘起嘴，皱了皱鼻子。“……可疑！”她轻声嘀咕道。

"I dunno…" Keita scratched at his chin.  
“我不太清楚……”圭太挠了挠下巴。

Suddenly, the class representative shot up, "Rise! Bow!" Hikari Horaki ordered as the rest of the children followed suit.  
突然，班长站了起来，“起立！鞠躬！”Hikari Horaki 命令道，其他孩子们也跟着照做。

In walked their senior teacher, Mr. Wantanabe. He motioned for the class to sit with his hands and pulled out a laser pointer, "I understand that we have a new student today, would they care to introduce themselves in front of the class?"  
他们的资深教师 Wantanabe 先生走了进来。他用手势示意全班坐下，并拿出一个激光笔，“我知道我们今天有一位新同学，他们愿意在全班面前自我介绍一下吗？”

…

The students looked around the class in search of the new arrival. The New Kid shrunk lower into his desk. In complete unison, the class looked down at his chest. A laser was pointed right at him.  
学生们环顾教室寻找新来的同学。新同学缩在桌子下面更低了。全班同学齐刷刷地低头看向他的胸前。一束激光正好指向他。

The New Kid slowly stood up and tentatively stepped in front of the black board. His hands shifted from going in and out of his pockets. "My name is Shinji-."  
新来的孩子缓缓站起身，小心翼翼地走到黑板前。他的手在口袋里进进出出。“我叫真嗣——”

"Young man," Mr. Wantanbe interrupted, "You're suppose to write your name on the black board."  
“年轻人，”万太郎老师打断道，“你应该在黑板上写下你的名字。”

"O-oh, right." He wrote his name in rigid letters and turned around. "My name is Shinji Ikari."He bowed. "Thank you for having me."  
"“哦，对了。”他用僵硬的字母写下自己的名字，然后转过身来。“我叫碇真嗣。”他鞠了一躬。“谢谢你们接纳我。””

Nobody responded, except for Mana who clapped enthusiastically.  
除了 Mana 热情地鼓掌外，没有人回应。

"Alright kids, let's not go crazy." Mr. Wantanabe motioned for Shinji to sit back down. "We have important things to discuss." He cleared his throat and turned on the projector, "Now, the repercussions of the Second Impact were more than just environmental, they were economical…"  
“好了，孩子们，别太激动。”Mr. Wantanabe 示意 Shinji 坐回去。“我们有重要的事情要讨论。”他清了清嗓子，打开了投影仪，“现在，第二次冲击的影响不仅仅是环境上的，还有经济上的……”

The class let out a unanimous groan.  
全班一致发出了抱怨声。

Lee turned to his co-pilots, "We'll talk more at lunch." He whispered.  
李转向他的副驾驶们，“我们午饭时再细谈。”他低声说道。

---

"Okay." Their fearless leader beckoned Mana and Keita to scoot their chairs closer. "We have all three of our new friends here at class, so we can get started."  
“好的。”他们的无畏领袖示意 Mana 和 Keita 把椅子挪近一些。“我们班上三位新朋友都到齐了，可以开始了。”

Mana leaned back, "Finally!"  
Mana 向后靠了靠，“终于！”

As opposed to Keita, he began to sweat, "W-what? Are we doing it? Here? Now!?"  
与 Mana 相反，Keita 开始冒汗，“什、什么？我们要开始了？在这里？现在！？”

"What?" Lee squinted, "No, you moron, too soon, it's not even here yet. I mean we can finally start gathering info. We'll split them up, three by three."  
“什么？”李眯起眼睛，“不，你这个笨蛋，太早了，它还没到呢。我是说我们终于可以开始收集信息了。我们分成三组，每组三人。”

Keita sighed, "Oh, for a second there I thought-"  
健太叹了口气，“哦，有那么一瞬间我以为——”

"Dibs on Langley." Lee said with a smirk as he crossed his arms.  
"我要兰利。" 李带着一丝得意的笑容交叉双臂说道。

"Why do you get her?"  
"你为什么能选她？"

Lee scoffed, "Cause I'm part German." He gestured to Asuka, "She's part German, it's a natural fit. Why? You want her?"  
李嗤之以鼻，"因为我有德国血统。" 他指向明日香，"她也有德国血统，这是天作之合。怎么？你也想要她？"

Keita's eyes widened, "No! She creeps me out."  
“不！她让我毛骨悚然。” 庆太的眼睛瞪大了。

"Yeah." Mana agreed. "She's kind of a-" She glanced around the class. "-A… b-word." Mana leaned back into the semi-circle of desks, "In that case, can I get Shinji?"  
“是啊。”玛娜附和道，“她有点像——”她环顾了一下教室，“——一个……脏话。”玛娜向后靠在半圆形的课桌上，“那样的话，我可以选真嗣吗？”

"No, you get Ayanami." “不行，你选绫波。”

"Aw!" Mana pouted, "She's so hard to talk to, why can't Keita have her?"  
"啊！" 玛娜撅嘴道，"她那么难沟通，为什么不能让圭太跟她谈？"

"Come on, you know Keita can't talk to girls alone." Lee looked at two other students in the class, a jock and his bespectacled friend. "Besides, he's buddy-buddy with Aida and Suzuhara. He'll invite Ikari in, make him feel relaxed and he opens up- Bamn! He starts spilling the beans."  
"拜托，你知道圭太单独跟女生说话不行的。" 李看向班上的另外两名学生，一个运动员和他的戴眼镜的朋友。"再说了，他和相田、铃原关系不错。他会邀请五十岚进来，让他放松下来，然后——嘭！他就全盘托出了。"

Keita leaned into the chair, "I'm not buddy-buddy with them! I just hang around with them sometimes."  
圭太靠在椅子上，"我和他们才不是关系好呢！只是偶尔一起玩玩而已。"

Lee nodded at Mana, "Which is what he does best. He hangs around. Okay, so there's no objections?"  
李对玛娜点了点头，“这就是他最擅长的。他总是在附近晃悠。好吧，那么没有人反对吧？”

Hands pounded against the desk, Keita shot up, "Stop talking like I'm not here! I have things to say too, you know."  
手重重地拍在桌子上，圭太猛地站了起来，“别当我不在场似的！我也有话要说，你们知道吗。”

He finally turns his head and looks at Keita. "Sure. Do you have any better ideas?" Keita froze, Lee nodded, "Go ahead."  
他终于转过头来看着圭太。"当然。你有什么更好的主意吗？" 圭太愣住了，李点头示意，"去吧。"

Keita leaned back, he looked up and realized the whole class stared at his outburst. He slowly sat back down. "Forget it."  
启太向后靠去，抬头发现全班都在盯着他的爆发。他慢慢坐回座位。“算了。”

Mana glanced at him sympathetically. "We can switch if you want…"  
麻奈同情地看了他一眼。“如果你想的话，我们可以换……”

"No." Keita's jaw tightened. "It's fine."  
“不用。”启太的下颌紧绷。“没事。”

The three stared at their desks, their thoughts muffled out by the classroom's resumed chatter. Lee scooted in closer to the circle, "Guys, c'mon, lighten up! If we can find out about an Angel attack, or find a window where there's a mess and they're not there, we go in and clean it up! Then we'll be the heroes. Us. How long have we waited for something like this to just plop on our laps? To prove ourselves?" He looked at Mana, "Kirishima, how long has it been? Do you really just want to sit and wait more?"  
三人盯着各自的桌子，教室里恢复的嘈杂声将他们的思绪淹没。李悄悄地挪近了圈子，“伙计们，振作起来！如果我们能发现天使的袭击，或者找到一个混乱的窗口而他们不在那里，我们就进去清理干净！那样我们就会成为英雄。是我们。我们等这样的机会等了多久？为了证明自己？”他看向真奈，“桐岛，已经多久了？你真的只想继续坐着等待吗？”

Mana's cheery attitude faded as she recollected, "Three years of training, conditioning, we were just told to sit and wait for months. " She looked up, "You're right, this is our time, not theirs."  
真奈的乐观态度随着回忆消退，“三年的训练，调整，我们被告知要坐等几个月。”她抬起头，“你说得对，这是我们的时代，不是他们的。”

Lee nodded, then turned to Keita, "Asari." Ketia lifted his head, "Are you with us?"  
李点点头，然后转向圭太，“浅利。”圭太抬起头，“你跟我们一起吗？”

Again, the two looked at him expectantly.  
两人再次满怀期待地看着他。

Keita gulped. "Of course."  
圭太咽了咽口水。“当然。”

"You guys…" Lee motioned for them to huddle, arm in arm, reminiscent of a football team. "Just you watch, I'll have Langley eating out of my hand by the end of the lunch break." He pointed three fingers in the centre of the huddle, they added to the pile and lifted their hands in sync.  
“你们这些家伙……”李示意他们围拢过来，手臂搭在彼此肩上，宛如一支足球队。“你们就等着瞧吧，午餐结束前，我会让兰利对我言听计从。”他伸出三根手指放在圈中央，他们也纷纷加入，一起同步举起手。

"1…"

"2…"

"3…"

"Tridents!" They all whispered sharply in unison.  
"三叉戟！" 他们齐声低语，语气尖锐。

The trio broke off in pursuit of their respective marks.  
三人分头追向各自的标记。

---

Rei had left the classroom, so Mana followed.  
丽已经离开了教室，所以麻奈跟了上去。

She noticed Mana follow her in the empty hallway with a side eyed glance, but she didn't shrink away, instead she walked faster.  
她注意到玛娜在空荡荡的走廊上斜眼瞥着她跟了上来，但她没有退缩，反而加快了脚步。

And so did Rei. 丽也是如此。

"Heya, Ayanami!" Mana called out, hands cupped, "Where ya going?"  
“嘿，绫波！”玛娜喊道，双手拢在嘴边，“你要去哪儿？”

The mysterious girl halted and slowly turned around. She studied Mana's chipper gait with her hands behind her back, heels clicked together. "I am going to the library." Rei said softly.  
神秘的女孩停下脚步，缓缓转过身来。她双手背在身后，脚跟轻轻相碰，仔细观察着 Mana 轻快的步伐。“我要去图书馆。”丽轻声说道。

"Neat!" Mana motioned for her to walk, but Rei didn't move. "Mind if I tag along?"  
“真不错！”Mana 示意她一起走，但丽没有动。“介意我跟着吗？”

Rei stared at her blankly, "What for?"  
丽面无表情地盯着她，“为什么？”

"Well-" Mana blinked and looked around, "Cause I wanna be friends with you!"  
"嗯——" 玛娜眨了眨眼，环顾四周，"因为我想和你做朋友！"

"...What for?" "...为什么？"

"Bec-" Mana briefly pouted and rubbed her nose, Rei held her gaze. "Because… I'm friendly!"  
"因——" 玛娜短暂地噘了噘嘴，揉了揉鼻子，丽看着她的眼睛。"因为…我很友好！"

Finally, Rei's eyes shifted slightly, as though she considered. "I shall be your friend."  
终于，丽的眼眸微微一动，仿佛在思索。“我会成为你的朋友。”

"Really? That's great! So-"  
“真的吗？太好了！那么——”

"...If I am ordered to be your friend."  
“……如果我被命令要成为你的朋友。”

Mana's smile dropped and she became speechless. Rei side eyed her as she walked away. "W-wait!" She turned back. Mana pointed her finger at her, "I order you to be my friend!"  
玛娜的笑容消失了，她变得哑口无言。丽侧眼看着她走开。“等-等一下！”她转过身来。玛娜用手指着她，“我命令你做我的朋友！”

Rei stared blankly for a moment before she tilted her head.  
丽愣了一会儿，然后歪了歪头。

---

Musashi Lee Strasberg marched confidently to the far side of the classroom, where Asuka played a video game on a mobile device, ear plugs attached to drown out the ambient chatter.  
武藏·李·斯特拉斯伯格自信地走向教室的另一边，那里明日香正在用移动设备玩游戏，耳塞插着以隔绝周围的嘈杂声。

"_She's so pale… so mysterious."_ Lee thought to himself as he leaned in to find the blue eyes hidden by her red bangs. He cleared his throat.  
"她如此苍白…如此神秘。" 李心中想着，倾身试图透过她红色的刘海找到那双隐藏的蓝眼睛。他清了清喉咙。

Asuka didn't hear him. 明日香没听见他说话。

Lee blinked, "Ah-hem!" He attempted again. She glanced at him with her peripherals. Lee smirked, "Hallo!"  
李眨了眨眼，"啊-哼！" 他再次尝试。她用眼角余光瞥了他一眼。李微微一笑，"哈喽！"

The girl slowly took off her headphones and eyed him suspiciously, "...Yo."  
女孩缓缓摘下耳机，狐疑地盯着他，"...哟。"

He brushed back his purple hair and smirked, "Dein rotes Haar brennt in meinem wie ein Feuer und schmilzt eine eisige Höhle, von der ich nie wusste, dass sie existiert. Meine Prinzessin, triff deinen Ritter." Lee leaned back, hands proudly at his hips.  
他捋了捋紫色的头发，嘴角上扬，"你的红发在我心中如烈火般燃烧，融化了我从未知晓其存在的冰冷洞穴。我的公主，选择你的骑士吧。"李靠回椅背，双手自豪地叉在腰间。

Asuka stared at him for a long time and blinked slowly. "The… fucks that suppose to be?"  
明日香长时间地盯着他，慢慢地眨了眨眼。"这…他妈的是什么意思？"

Lee's smile dropped. "Oh. You know, German."  
李的笑容消失了。“哦。你知道，德语。”

She never dropped eye contact, her brow lowered, "Do I look like I speak German?"  
她始终没有移开目光，眉头紧锁，“我看起来像是会说德语吗？”

"W-well, I thought, I heard- heh-heh…"  
“呃，我以为，我听到——呵呵……”

"Who are you? Who've you been talking to?" Asuka pointed at her chest proudly and leaned in, "I'm an _American._"  
"你是谁？你一直在和谁说话？" 明日香自豪地指着自己的胸口，凑近了说，"我是个美国人。"

Lee's eyes darted to the side as he regretted not trading with Keita, "A-american, huh? Thats-"  
李的目光闪烁着转向一旁，后悔没有和圭太交换，"美-美国人啊？那真是-"

Asuka squinted and motioned him away, "...Shoo."  
明日香眯起眼睛，示意他离开，"...走开。"

"Yes 'mam". “是的，女士。”

Shinji had a very brief run in with public schools as a child, the memories of it were foggy. He remembered the walks there, riding the subway with his cousin and attempting to melt into his desk. If they were nice to him, he liked people, just not in large groups. It felt like too many instruments being played at once, but never a symphony. Some insistence from his father and tests determined that Shinji found it easier to concentrate and complete tasks with more confidence outside of social settings.  
真嗣小时候短暂地接触过公立学校，那段记忆已经模糊不清。他记得去学校的路，和表姐一起乘坐地铁，试图将自己融入课桌之中。如果人们对他友好，他会喜欢他们，只是不喜欢在人群中。那感觉就像太多乐器同时演奏，却从未形成交响乐。父亲的坚持和测试表明，真嗣发现自己在社交场合之外更能集中注意力并更有信心完成任务。

'Agoraphobia' Mr. Tsuji, his now former tutor described it as. Age had numbed the feeling, but the buzz still lingered in his head, the way out was an ever present eyesore.  
“广场恐惧症”，他现在的前家庭教师冢地先生这样描述。随着年龄的增长，这种感觉已经麻木，但那种嗡嗡声仍然萦绕在他的脑海中，逃离的路始终是个碍眼的存在。

The only people he knew in this school stood on far opposites of the classroom, with Rei Ayanami on the left and Asuka Langley on the right, shielded by walls of other students in the densely fitted classroom of 25.  
在这所学校里，他唯一认识的人分别站在教室的两端，绫波零在左边，惣流·明日香·兰格雷在右边，被密集排列的 25 名学生所形成的墙壁隔开。

Surprisingly, the transition from homeschooling to highschool wasn't a jarring one, the material was familiar at least. It was a grateful retreat from all the chattering-  
出乎意料的是，从家庭教育过渡到高中生活并不突兀，至少教材是熟悉的。这让他从嘈杂的闲聊中解脱出来，感到欣慰。

Someone stepped in front of him, a shorter boy with freckles and an even shorter haircut, similar to a military flat top. "Ah, hello!" He said quietly.  
一个身影挡在了他面前，是个脸上有雀斑的矮个子男孩，留着比军训平头还短的发型。“啊，你好！”他轻声说道。

Shinji looked up at him and smiled, "Oh, hello."  
真嗣抬头看着他，微笑道：“哦，你好。”

"Hi.' The boy swayed his arms, "You're that new student, Shinji, right?"  
“嗨。”男孩挥动着手臂，“你就是新来的学生，真嗣，对吧？”

He looked at his name that was still written on the black board in massive letters and gestured to it. "Yeah, that's me."  
他看着黑板上仍以巨大字体写着他的名字，并指向那里。“是的，那就是我。”

"Well, my name's Keita Asari."  
"嗯，我叫浅利圭太。"

"Oh, nice to meet you."  
"哦，很高兴见到你。"

"Yeah…" "是啊……"

Keita rubbed the back of his head and looked to the right, "There's, uh- actually some guys over here who wanted to meet you. "  
启太挠了挠后脑勺，向右边看去，“那边，呃——其实有几个家伙想见见你。”

Shinji blinked, "Meet me?" He peered over to where Keita looked but wasn't sure exactly who,  
真嗣眨了眨眼，“见我？”他顺着启太的目光望去，但不确定具体是哪些人，

"I dunno, I prefer to keep to myself."  
“我不太清楚，我更喜欢独来独往。”

"Well, I just thought the three of you would get along real good, y'know?" Keita motioned back to the group, "Come on! Just give them a chance."  
“哎，我就觉得你们三个会相处得很好，知道吧？” 圭太示意了一下那群人，“来吧！给他们一个机会。”

His foot bounced rapidly as he considered his options. No sense in burning bridges on the first day of school. "Okay, I guess I'll say hello."  
他一边考虑着选择，脚一边快速地抖动着。第一天上学就断绝后路可不明智。“好吧，我想我会打个招呼。”

He stood up and followed Keita to two other boys, one tanned in a tracksuit, the other a sandy blonde with large spectacles. The two spoke in low voices.  
他站起来，跟着圭太走向另外两个男孩，一个皮肤黝黑穿着运动服，另一个是沙金色头发，戴着大眼镜。两人正低声交谈着。

Keita cleared his throat, "H-hey guys?" The two looked up at him, "I just wanted to introduce that new kid, this is Shinji." He turned to Shinji, "Shinji, this is Kensuke Aida and Toji Suzuhara."  
“咳咳，” 剑太清了清嗓子，“嘿，伙计们？”两人抬头看向他，“我只是想介绍一下新来的孩子，这是真嗣。”他转向真嗣，“真嗣，这是相田剑介和铃原东治。”

Shinji smiled and offered a small wave, "Hey guys…"  
真嗣微笑着，轻轻挥了挥手，“嘿，大家好……”

The two studied him up and down. Kensuke smirked, his glasses flashed white as he lowered his brow and caught the light, "So, you're the guy, huh?"  
两人上下打量着他。剑介嘴角微扬，眼镜闪过一道白光，他压低眉头，捕捉到了光线，“所以，你就是那个家伙，嗯？”

"_They know…_" "他们知道了…"

His eyes widened. Was his cover blown that quickly? "T-the guy? I don't know about that, Asari said that you wanted to meet me?"  
他的眼睛睁大了。难道这么快就暴露了？“那家伙？我不清楚啊，Asari 说你想见我？”

"Ah, I see." Kensuke leaned over to Toji and spoke in his ear, "He's playing the innocent defense." Toji nodded, "That's fine, Mr. Ikari. Please, take a seat."  
"啊，我明白了。" 健介凑近了真嗣，在他耳边说，"他在装无辜。" 真嗣点点头，"没关系，碇先生。请坐。"

Confused, Shinji slowly sat down in front of the two, while Keita stood off to the side.  
困惑中，真嗣缓缓坐在两人面前，而圭太则站在一旁。

Kensuke leaned in, hands curled together, "So, what's your poison?"  
健介凑近了些，双手交握，“那么，你的选择是什么？”

Shinji blinked, "I'm sorry?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼，"你说什么？"

"Wow, he's very committed to this." Kensuke said to Toji, "The place isn't bugged you know. You can tell us."  
“哇，他对此真是投入啊。” 真希对冬二说，“这里没被监听，你知道的。你可以告诉我们。”

"I, uh…" Shinji gulped and moved to his collar.  
“我，呃……” 真嗣咽了口唾沫，伸手摸向衣领。

Toji leaned back, arms crossed, "Just answer the question, man."  
冬二向后一靠，双臂交叉，“直接回答问题吧，兄弟。”

"Whose pictures do you want?"  
“你想看谁的照片？”

Shinji shut his eyes tight, "I swear I'm not the pi- wait, what? P-pictures." He leaned back and sighed in relief. He needed to think of a way to keep a low profile, quick, "Who do you have?"  
“我发誓我不是那个意思——等等，什么？图、图片。”他闭紧眼睛，随即后仰并松了口气。他需要迅速想个办法保持低调，“你有谁的？”

Kensuke scoffed, "Who don't I have?" He motioned Shinji to lean closer and scanned the loud classroom. "I can get you any girl, or guy if that's your thing. Except for Horaki. She's off limits." His eyes lit up he glanced to the far right of the room, "I see. You want something more thrilling, a thorned rose perhaps?" He glanced at Asuka, "Pics of her might cost me my life, so it'll cost you extra."  
“我没有的？”真希波嗤之以鼻，示意真嗣靠得更近些，并扫视着喧闹的教室。“我可以给你任何女孩的照片，或者男孩的，如果你有这个爱好。除了洞木。她是禁区。”他的眼睛一亮，瞥向教室的右后方，“我明白了。你想要更刺激的，比如带刺的玫瑰？”他看向明日香，“她的照片可能会让我丧命，所以得额外收费。”

"Trust me, new kid." Toji said, "Dance with the Devil, and you'll get burned."  
"相信我，新来的。" 冬二说道，"与魔鬼共舞，你会被烧伤的。"

Shinji shook his head, "I'm so confused."  
真嗣摇了摇头，"我完全搞不懂。"

Toji gestured with his hands, "And trust me, not like a little sunburn, like being melted in a lava kind of burn." He shuddered.  
冬二用手比划着，"相信我，不是轻微的晒伤，而是像被熔岩融化那种程度的烧伤。" 他打了个寒颤。

"She stabbed him with a pencil one time." Kensuke elaborated.  
“她有一次用铅笔扎了他。”健介详细解释道。

"With a freaking pencil!"  
"用一支该死的铅笔！"

Shinji waved his hands, "Wait, I think there's a misunderstanding. I don't really want to buy voyeur photos of girls.  
真嗣挥着手说，"等等，我想这里面有误会。我并不是真的想买女生的偷窥照片。

Kensuke's eyes bulged out as he shushed him frantically, "Easy, Ikari! What are you trying to do here?" He turned to Keita, "You really think I'm gonna give you a subscribers bonus for getting a mole mixed into my business?'  
健介的眼睛瞪得溜圆，急忙嘘声制止他，“冷静点，碇！你这是想干什么？”他转向圭太，“你真以为我会因为你安插个间谍到我这儿来就给你订阅奖金？”

"A-a mole?" Keita chuckled, "He's no mole, I just thought-" He cleared his throat, "-I thought you guys might get along well."  
“间、间谍？”圭太轻笑道，“他可不是间谍，我只是觉得——”他清了清嗓子，“——我觉得你们可能会相处得不错。”

"Hmph." Toji pouted and sized him up with a squint, "Well, why didn't you say so!? You know how much I hate talking shop." He motioned for the two to sit down, "So, new kid, what brings you here? To Tokyo-3, I mean."  
“哼。”冬二噘着嘴，眯眼打量着他，“那你为什么不早说！？你知道我有多讨厌谈生意。”他示意两人坐下，“那么，新来的，你来东京-3 有什么事吗？”

"What brings me here…" Shinji's eyes darted at the two, "Work."  
"是什么让我来到这里……" 真嗣的目光在两人间游移，"工作。"

"Work?" Kensuke raised an eyebrow, "You have a job?"  
"工作？" 健介挑了挑眉，"你有工作了？"

"No, my father got a job at NERV recently."  
"不，是我父亲最近在 NERV 找到了工作。"

"Oh, gotcha." Toji nodded, "Same here, my old mans working all the time so I gotta look after my little sister."  
"哦，明白了。" 冬二点点头，"我也是，我老爸总是忙得不可开交，所以我得照顾我的小妹妹。"

Keita nodded, "My father works at NERV too!"  
圭太点头道，"我父亲也在 NERV 工作！"

"All our fathers work at NERV." Kensuke said, "Super interesting. Welcome to the club. " He pointed his chin at Shinji, "Say Ikari. You heard about the earthquake at Yugawara ruins, by the highway?"  
"我们所有人的父亲都在 NERV 工作。" 健介说，"超级有趣。欢迎加入俱乐部。" 他朝真嗣扬了扬下巴，"说起来，碇，你听说了高速公路旁汤河原遗迹发生的地震吗？"

Shinji could only assume that was NERV's version of the story for the public, so he nodded.  
真嗣只能推测那是 NERV 对公众的官方说辞，于是他点了点头。

"Well, guess what I heard?" He leaned in closer, "That wasn't an earthquake."  
“好吧，猜猜我听到了什么？”他凑得更近了些，“那不是地震。”

He feigned ignorance, his eyes darted at Asuka, who was gone from her seat. "So what was it?"  
他假装无知，目光迅速扫向明日香，她已经不在座位上了。“那到底是什么？”

Kensuke grinned, "An alien. Yup. A freaking alien! Between us guys, yea? NERV covered it up-"  
健介咧嘴一笑，"外星人。没错。一个该死的外星人！咱们哥们儿之间说说，对吧？NERV 掩盖了这一切——"

Toji squinted, "What? That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard."  
冬二眯起眼睛，"什么？这是我听过的最蠢的事了。"

Kensuke began to stammer, "There were photos of these giant mechas. Man, if I could just get some footage of them. It was like from Jet Jaguar dude, you wouldn't believe it! And here's the best part…" All three of the boys leaned in closer to Kensuke. "I think I know who the pilot is."  
健介开始结巴，"有这些巨大机甲的照片。伙计，要是我能拍到一些视频就好了。就像《喷射杰格》里的那样，你绝对不会相信的！而最精彩的部分是……"三个男孩都凑近了健介。"我想我知道驾驶员是谁了。"

Sweat began to fall down Shinji's brow. "Yeah? Who?"  
汗水开始从真嗣的额头上滑落。“是吗？谁？”

"Remember what I said about the thorned rose?"  
“记得我说的带刺玫瑰吗？”

Toji blinked, "No way." 剑介眨了眨眼，“不会吧。”

Kensuke nodded. "Way."  Kensuke 点了点头。“当然。”

Shinji glanced at Asuka's empty seat again and scanned the room for her. She stood beside the class rep, Hikari, and showed her a piece of paper..  
真嗣再次瞥了一眼明日香空着的座位，环视教室寻找她。她正站在班长光身边，向她展示一张纸。

Asuka pointed right at them.  
明日香直接指向了他们。

Toji ran his hand through his hair, "It makes so much sense…"  
真嗣捋了捋头发，“这太合理了……”

"I know, right? Think about it." Kensuke adjusted his glasses, "She leaves randomly throughout the day, sometimes with the Ayanami chick-"  
“我知道，对吧？想想看。” 健司调整了一下眼镜，“她一天中会随机离开几次，有时是和绫波一起——”

"You mean the Albino?" Toji asked.  
“你是说那个白发女孩？” 真嗣问道。

"Please don't call her that." Shinji blurted out.  
“请别那样叫她。”真嗣脱口而出。

Toji stared at him for a moment and raised his hands in peace. "I'd take her over Soryu. If she really is the pilot, I wouldn't wanna piss her off."  
剑介盯着他看了一会儿，然后举起双手表示和平。“我宁愿选她也不要惣流。如果她真的是驾驶员，我可不想惹她生气。”

"Man, she's so lucky…" Kensuke stared at the ceiling and sighed, "I'd sell my soul to be a mecha pilot."  
“天哪，她真幸运……”健介盯着天花板叹了口气，“我愿意出卖灵魂去当机甲驾驶员。”

Asuka marched towards the four boys, her eyes locked at Shinji. Toji groaned, "Speak of the Devil…"  
明日香大步走向那四个男孩，目光紧锁在真嗣身上。 “说曹操曹操到……” 阿斯兰叹道。

She raised her hand in front of Toji's face, "Piss off, monkey. I'm not here for you." Asuka pointed at Shinji. "New kid. You're with me."  
她举手挡在真嗣面前，“滚开，猴子。我不是来找你的。”明日香指向真嗣，“新来的，你跟我走。”

He looked at the clock, at his new friends, then at Asuka. "Now?"  
他看了看时钟，又看了看新朋友们，最后看向明日香，“现在？”

"Now." "现在。"

Shinji took his time to sit up, like an old man would. Kensuke squinted at her, "Where to?"  
真嗣慢慢坐起身，像个老人一样。剑介眯眼看着她，“去哪儿？”

"None of your business, four eyes." She sneered. Kensuke lifted his arms in defeat. "We got special permission."  
“关你屁事，四眼仔。”她嘲讽道。 Kensuke 举起双手表示投降。“我们有特别许可。”

"From who?" "从谁那里？"

"Your mom." Asuka grabbed Shinji's wrist, "Come on, double time!"  
“你妈的。”Asuka 抓住 Shinji 的手腕，“快点，加快速度！”

Keita, Toji and Kensuke stared in disbelief as the two speeded out of the classroom. Toji and Kensuke slowly turned and gawked at each other. "Dude…"  
Keita、Toji 和 Kensuke 难以置信地看着两人迅速离开教室。Toji 和 Kensuke 缓缓转头，目瞪口呆地对视。“兄弟…”

"Dude!" "哥们！"

Keita noticed Lee lean on the opposite side of the class, who nodded at him.  
圭太注意到李靠在教室的另一边，朝他点了点头。

"Dude!" "哥们！"

She was so used to the EVA lift at this rate, that it was as leisurely as being on a regular elevator.  
她已经习惯了这种速度的 EVA 升降机，感觉就像乘坐普通电梯一样悠闲。

Asuka would always take the moment before she reached the surface to calm her nerves, to fine tune her synchronization.  
在到达地面之前，明日香总会利用这段时间平复心情，调整同步率。

However, it was difficult to relax while her trainees' undignified yelps and chattering of teeth grated into her ears. She settled with a mental review of what she would teach the green pilot when they reached the surface.  
然而，当她听到学员们不体面的尖叫和牙齿打颤的声音时，很难放松下来。她只好在心里回顾到达地面后要教给那位新手飞行员的内容。

Misato's voice spoke through the comms, "_Release the final safety locks."_  
美里通过通讯器下达指令：“解除最终安全锁。”

"_Releasing."_ “正在解除。”

Both doors slid open, side by side, and Unit-02 swaggered out of the elevator right into her playground.  
两扇门并排滑开，二号机大摇大摆地走出电梯，径直踏入了它的战场。

"There's a lot you need to learn about this job, new kid." She waited for him to respond.  
"这份工作有很多需要你学的，新来的。" 她等着他回应。

Nothing, so she continued as she strolled through an empty section of Tokyo-03, their mock training ground. "First things first, Third, Always watch your umbilical cable. Last thing you need to do is trip, or get stuck with a five minute timer while in the middle of a-"  
没有回应，于是她继续在东京-03 的空旷区域漫步，这里是他们的模拟训练场。"首先，第三点，永远要注意你的脐带电缆。最不需要的就是绊倒，或者在中间的时候被五分钟计时器卡住-"

Why weren't there any footsteps?  
为什么没有脚步声？

Asuka turned back to the elevator to see Unit-01 still stiffly nestled inside it's frame. "What are you doing?"  
明日香转回电梯，看到初号机依旧僵硬地嵌在它的框架内。“你在干什么？”

Unit-01 looked down. "_...I dunno."_  
初号机低头。“……我不知道。”

"Well don't just stand there, genius. Take a step!"  
“好吧，别光站在那儿，天才。迈一步！”

"_It's alright, Shinji. Just concentrate on walking. Just like the simulation."_ Misato said.  
"没事的，真嗣。集中精力走路，就像模拟训练一样。" 美里说道。

Unit-01 looked at its feet, "_Right. Walk."_ It's separated from the elevator's frame, arms stretched out wide. He attempted his first step with wobbled legs, like a newborn giraffe. The EVA gained solid ground. "_Just like the simulation."_  
初号机低头看着自己的脚，"对，走。" 它从电梯框架中分离出来，双臂张开。他尝试着迈出第一步，双腿颤抖，如同新生的小长颈鹿。EVA 稳稳地踏上了地面。"就像模拟训练一样。"

Now up close, Asuka was able to size up the new EVA. Years back, she remembered Unit-01 had a smooth, vibrant indigo color, with neon green to accent it.  
现在近距离观察，明日香得以仔细打量这台新的 EVA。多年前，她记得初号机有着光滑、鲜艳的靛蓝色，搭配着霓虹绿作为点缀。

It has certainly seen better years, that deep purple was faded to a pale lavender, with a sickly green and brown rust that ate at parts of the coating.  
它确实有过更好的时光，那深紫色已褪成淡紫罗兰色，部分涂层被病态的绿褐色锈迹侵蚀。

Nonetheless, it was mechanically fine tuned prior to its activation, so this… idiot should have no excuses.  
尽管如此，在激活前它已被机械地精细调校，所以这个……白痴应该没有任何借口。

After all, Asuka was never allowed any when she took her first steps.  
毕竟，明日香在她迈出第一步时从未被允许有任何借口。

His voice began to sound more confident, "_Walk…"_  
他的声音开始听起来更加自信，“走……”

"See? Was that so-" “看吧？有那么难吗——”

Unit-01 tripped and buckled under itself. It fell face first flat to the ground. The comm feed was speechless, save for a cough from the background crew.  
初号机绊了一下，自己摔倒了。它脸朝下平躺在地上。通讯频道一片沉默，除了背景中工作人员的一声咳嗽。

She stomped towards the crumpled Third Child, who pathetically made no effort to stand on his own. "Shinji Ikari…" Asuka began. He looked up to see Unit-02's feet. She stared down at him with her hands on her hips. "You're fired."  
她大步走向那瘫软在地、可怜兮兮连站都站不起来的第三适格者。“碇真嗣……”明日香开口道。他抬头望去，只见二号机的脚。她双手叉腰，俯视着他。“你被解雇了。”

Unit-01's head perked up, "_F-fired?"_  
初号机的头抬了起来，“被-解雇了？”

Misato groaned, "_Shinji, no, you're not fired. She can't do that."_  
美里叹了口气，“真嗣，不，你没被解雇。她不能这么做。”

"You heard me, scrub. Go home. As your superior pilot, I'm pulling rank on you." Unit-02 jabbed a thumb over her back. "Beat it!"  
“你听到了，菜鸟。回家去。作为你的上级飞行员，我命令你。”二号机用拇指戳了戳自己的背。“快走开！”

"_Asuka, you're the same rank as him."_  
“明日香，你和他的军衔是一样的。”

Unit-02 turned her body to face Misato, despite the fact she was on radio in Central Dogma, "Oh, come on! If he had to fight an Angel at this rate, he'd get ripped apart!"  
二号机转过身面对美里，尽管她是在中央教条区通过无线电通话，“哦，拜托！如果他以这种状态去对抗使徒，肯定会被撕成碎片的！”

"_...Asuka, why on earth would we send him out to fight an Angel without any sort of experience?"_  
"...明日香，我们怎么可能在没有他任何经验的情况下派他去对抗使徒呢？"

"_I don't see any instance where that would happen."_ Ritsuko agreed in the background.  
"我看不出有任何这种情况会发生。" 律子在背景中附和道。"

Unit-02's hands slapped against it's thighs, which echoed throughout the derelict district. "You're not helping!"  
二号机的双手拍打着大腿，声音在废弃的区域回荡。"你这不是在帮忙！"

Shinji remained crumpled on the ground.  
真嗣依旧蜷缩在地上。

"_Asuka."_ Misato said in that bossy tone she always pulled, "_Remember what Naoko said-"_  
"明日香。" 美里用她一贯的命令口吻说道，"记得直子说过的话——"

"Yeah, yeah, positive reinforcement, I know." Asuka grumbled, "Buncha sissies." She leaned over the crumpled Unit-01 and patted her thighs, "Come on, buddy, get up!" She whistled, as though she encouraged a puppy, or a small child, "That's it, you can do it!"  
"是是，积极鼓励，我知道。" 明日香咕哝着，"一群软蛋。" 她俯身向着蜷缩的初号机，拍了拍大腿，"来吧，伙计，站起来！" 她吹着口哨，仿佛在鼓励一只小狗或是一个小孩，"就是这样，你能做到的！"

Shinji attempted to get back on his feet. He grabbed onto a building and rose."_...I think I like you better when you're mean."_ After he regained his balance, he took a second step without support.  
真嗣试图重新站起来。他抓住一栋建筑，站了起来。...我觉得你刻薄的时候更讨人喜欢。" 恢复平衡后，他不用支撑又迈出了第二步。

Unit-02 mockingly threw her hands in the air, "Yay! You did it!"  
二号机嘲讽地举起双手，"耶！你做到了！"

Unit-01 ignored her as it took a third, and a fourth step until it was face to face with Unit-02. "_So, what's next?"_  
初号机无视她，继续迈出第三步、第四步，直到面对面站在二号机前。"那么，接下来呢？"

After a moment of eye contact between the two EVA's, She motioned for him to follow through the narrow city streets. The concrete floor appeared to have been walked over so many times that it was, to an EVA's scale, practically gravel. Of course, to a human's scale it would be a field of boulders.  
在两台 EVA 对视片刻后，她示意他跟随穿过狭窄的城市街道。混凝土路面似乎已被踩踏过无数次，以至于在 EVA 的尺度上，几乎成了碎石。当然，在人类的尺度上，这便是一片巨石之地。

Asuka tugged at Unit-01's umbilical cable, as though it were a ponytail. "You feel it feeding from that station? You have about a kilometre of cable there, it seems like a lot, but it runs out quicker than you think. Get used to where all the power stations are located, so you know where to go when you run out."  
明日香拉扯着初号机的脐带电缆，仿佛那是一条马尾辫。“你能感觉到从那个站点供能吗？你那儿大约有一公里的电缆，看似很长，但用起来比你想象的要快。习惯所有电站的位置，这样当你电量不足时就知道该去哪儿。”

"_But what if there aren't any power stations nearby?"_  
“但如果附近没有电站怎么办？”

"Well then you better kill your mark in five minutes, shouldn't you?"  
“那你就最好在五分钟内干掉你的目标，不是吗？”

"_I was just asking…"_ “我只是问问……”

Unit-02 motioned to a skyscraper that was wider than the others, she struck the flat of her fist against it and a panel slid aside, revealing a massive armoury. Asuka snatched two guns from the rack. "This is a pallet rifle." She tossed one into his arms. "Think fast, Third!"  
二号机指向一座比其他建筑更宽的摩天大楼，她用拳头敲击其表面，一块面板滑开，露出一个巨大的军械库。明日香从架子上抓起两把枪。“这是散弹枪。”她将其中一把扔给他。“接好了，第三！”

Unit-01 fumbled in an attempt to catch the rifle and held the thing. "_It's heavy._" He looked down at the sights, which were unwittingly aimed at Unit-02. "_I've never used a gun before."_  
初号机笨拙地试图抓住步枪并握住了它。“好重。”他低头看着瞄准器，无意中将枪口对准了二号机。“我以前从未用过枪。”

She pushed the gun out of her direction, "Well get used to it, cause from now on, that gun is your best friend." Asuka pointed at a building across from there. "Try shooting over there."  
她将枪推离自己的方向，“那就习惯它吧，因为从现在开始，那把枪就是你的好朋友了。”明日香指向对面的一栋建筑。“试着朝那边射击。”

Shinji peered at the building. It appeared to have only a single bullseye, shot multiple times. On the building beside it, two separate sets of tallies were etched into the concrete. Likely from those Progressive Knives he was shown.  
真嗣凝视着那栋建筑。它似乎只有一个靶心，被多次击中。旁边的建筑上，两组不同的计数刻在混凝土上。很可能是他之前见过的那些渐进刀留下的痕迹。

He placed the butt of the rifle square against his chest. Asuka stared at him, "Are you serious?"  
他将步枪的枪托稳稳地抵在胸前。明日香盯着他，“你是认真的吗？”

"_What?"_ "什么？"

She marched over to him, "It's supposed to go on your shoulder, stupid." Unit-02 adjusted Unit-01's form, her hands awkwardly hovered over its body. Asuka cleared her throat, "Now you try. Repeat after me: Center on target, pull the trigger."  
她大步走向他，“应该放在肩膀上，笨蛋。”二号机调整了一号机的姿势，她的手尴尬地悬在机体上方。明日香清了清嗓子，“现在你试试。跟我重复：瞄准目标，扣动扳机。”

"_Right. Center on targ-"_ He squeezed the trigger prematurely and the bullet flew wildly. Shinji exhaled sharply.  
“好的。瞄准目——”他过早地扣动了扳机，子弹疯狂地飞了出去。真嗣猛地呼出一口气。

"This isn't rocket science."  
"这又不是火箭科学。"

"_...Center on target. Pull the trigger."_ Shinji fired again, a few feet away from the bullseye.  
"...瞄准中心。扣动扳机。" 真嗣再次射击，离靶心只差几英尺。

Asuka scoffed, "Don't punch holes in my wall, new kid."  
明日香嗤之以鼻，"别在我墙上打洞，新来的。"

She noticed Shinji from inside the pilot's camera feed, he shut his eyes and took deep breaths. "_Center on target. Pull the trigger."_  
她从驾驶员的摄像头画面中注意到真嗣，他闭上眼睛，深呼吸。“瞄准目标。扣动扳机。”

Another burst. "_Center on target. Pull the trigger."_  
又是一阵射击。“瞄准目标。扣动扳机。”

"_Center on target. Pull the trigger."_ Another shot, another scoff from Asuka.  
“瞄准目标。扣动扳机。”又一枪，明日香又是一声嗤笑。

"_Center on target. Pull the-"_  
"瞄准目标中心。拉下——"

---

"-Trigger!" Shinji's eyes shot open and gasped. He suddenly woke up in his bathroom in front of the mirror.  
"——扳机！" 真嗣的眼睛猛地睁开，倒吸一口气。他突然在自己的浴室里醒来，站在镜子前。

He looked down to realize he held a bottle of toothpaste, which Shinji clenched from his involuntary spasm.  
他低头一看，发现自己正握着一支牙膏，这是真嗣因无意识痉挛而紧握住的。

Shinji looked down at his trembled hands. Anything the EVA felt left a phantom echo on his body. A side effect of synchronization, Ms. Ritsuko described it as.  
真嗣低头看着自己颤抖的双手。EVA 感受到的任何事物都会在他身上留下幻影般的回响。这是同步率的副作用，律子小姐曾这样描述过。

His free hand was covered in toothpaste, Shinji stared at it, then at his gaunt, tired reflection.  
他空着的那只手上沾满了牙膏，真嗣盯着它，又看向自己憔悴、疲惫的倒影。

The early morning training before classes seemed like a clever, efficient idea when Naoko let him choose the times for his routine synch tests a month ago. But now he deeply regretted not settling with being excused in the middle of classes.  
一个月前，直子让他选择同步测试的时间时，清晨训练似乎是个聪明又高效的主意。但现在，他深感后悔没有选择在课间休息时被免除训练。

Shinji shook his head, "I need to get a grip."  
真嗣摇了摇头，"我得振作起来。"

---

Shinji waddled out of the bathroom, a towel draped around his shoulders. On his way to the kitchen to start his morning routine, he ran into Misato, who was still dressed in her red jacket , a blanket draped around her like a massive cloak.  
真嗣蹒跚着走出浴室，肩上搭着一条毛巾。他走向厨房准备开始早晨的例行公事，途中遇到了美里，她仍穿着她的红色夹克，一条毯子像巨大的斗篷一样披在身上。

Misato held a beer can gingerly, as if it were a cup of espresso. "What were you doing in there for so long?"  
美里小心翼翼地拿着一罐啤酒，仿佛那是一杯浓缩咖啡。"你在里面那么久在做什么？"

"Just… brushing my teeth."  
"只是…在刷牙。"

"Oh, uh-huh. Just brushing your teeth."  
"哦，嗯哼。只是在刷牙。"

"I mean it!" "我是认真的！"

"Uh…huh." "呃…嗯。"

"Well, what about you? Shouldn't you be asleep?"  
"那你呢？你不应该在睡觉吗？"

Misato raised her finger, "I just got back from my shift, so first things first." She pointed at the bathroom. "I need to die for about an hour." She patted him on the back and strolled inside.  
美里竖起手指，"我刚下班回来，所以先做最重要的事。"她指向浴室。"我需要在里面死上一小时。"她拍了拍他的背，悠然走了进去。

Shinji shook his head as he reached into the cooler for a fresh bag of shrimp for Pen-Pen. He knew that he was above ground, yet the transition between the artificial sky of the Geofront and Tokyo-03's authentic one was seamless. As though he never left.  
真嗣摇了摇头，伸手从冷藏箱里拿出一袋新鲜的虾给 Pen-Pen。他知道自己已经来到了地面上，但从地底都市 Geofront 到东京-03 真实天空的过渡却如此无缝。仿佛他从未离开过。

A knock came from the bathroom. "_Oh, hey, Shinji?"_ Misato said, "_Is it Thursday today?"_  
浴室传来敲门声。“哦，嘿，真嗣？”美里问道，“今天是星期四吗？”

"Yeah, why? Oh, right. Garbage day." Shinji reminded himself with a sigh, "I'll take care of it." He began to make the rounds at each of the apartment's bins.  
“是啊，怎么了？哦，对了。垃圾日。”真嗣叹了口气，提醒自己，“我会处理的。”他开始逐一检查公寓里的每个垃圾桶。

"_Thanks! Hey, I might be getting off work early today. I'll bring some pizza, if you want?"_  
"谢谢！嘿，我今天可能提前下班。你要的话，我带些披萨过来？"

Shinji grabbed the bag from the kitchen. "Sure!"  
真嗣从厨房拿起袋子。“当然！”

"_Also, I left you something on the kitchen table, it's a cell phone!"_  
"还有，我在厨房桌上给你留了样东西，是个手机！"

"A cell phone?" Shinji walked over and inspected the small box. It was a Nokia, one of the smaller clunky ones. "Oh, thank you!"  
“手机？” 真嗣走过去仔细查看那个小盒子。这是一部诺基亚，其中一款较小的笨重型号。“哦，谢谢你！”

"_Don't mention it."_ The shower water shot in the background, "_I'm surprised you didn't have one before."_  
“不用谢。” 淋浴的水声在背景中响起，“我倒是惊讶你之前居然没有。”

"To be honest, I never noticed. I guess, I dunno…"  
“老实说，我从未注意到。我想，我不知道……”

"_...No one to call?"_  "...没人可以打电话吗？"

Shinji looked up in thought as he knocked on Pen-Pen's fridge to summon him for his meal. He didn't mind Aida and Suzuhara's company, but they only ever hung out during lunch breaks, never after school. Not to mention, their eccentric personalities overwhelmed him.  
真嗣一边思考着，一边敲了敲 Pen-Pen 的冰箱，召唤他来用餐。他不介意相田和铃原的陪伴，但他们只在午休时一起闲逛，放学后从不见面。更不用说，他们古怪的个性让他感到压力山大。

Keita Asari would walk with him to the train sometimes, attempt to spark conversation and ask personal questions. Such topics felt uncomfortable from what was effectively an acquaintance, so would attempt to invite Keita to speak for himself.  
浅利惠太有时会和他一起走到车站，试图展开对话并询问私人问题。这些话题从一个实际上只是熟人的人那里感到不舒服，所以他会试图邀请浅利自己来谈谈。

Despite his best efforts to seek out the one thing that kept him in Tokyo-03, he never seemed to get a moment alone to speak with Ayanami. Even then, he doubted she had a phone as well.  
尽管他竭尽全力寻找留在东京-03 的那份牵挂，却始终未能找到与绫波独处交谈的机会。即便如此，他也怀疑她是否拥有手机。

And Asuka… the only reason she'd accept his number would be to nag or berate him about being late for synch tests.  
至于明日香……她接受他的号码的唯一理由，恐怕只是为了责备他同步测试迟到。

Although, there were times when people weren't around, like when Naoko would check in on them over the weekend with tea and sweets, that a gentler side of Asuka would poke it's head out. She'd smile at him, listen to what he was saying, even open up at times.  
不过，有时在人们不在场的时候，比如直子周末带着茶和点心来看望他们时，明日香会展现出温柔的一面。她会对他微笑，倾听他的话语，甚至有时会敞开心扉。

Shinji blinked, "I dunno…"  
真嗣眨了眨眼，“我不太清楚……”

Maybe there was a second reason.  
或许还有第二个原因。

---

Thursdays were her favorite day of the week for one reason.  
星期四之所以是她一周中最喜欢的日子，有一个原因。

Everyone would bring their garbage early in the morning, where they would become her personal punching bags. Asuka knew better now than to take her anger out on the walls of her guardian's apartment, so she had to find alternative outlets where she could.  
每天一大早，大家都会带着垃圾来，成为她的私人沙袋。如今，明日香学乖了，不再把怒气发泄在监护人公寓的墙上，她得找其他出口。

Nice and private too, thick walls to hide the sound, and at seven in the morning, it would be deserted, like clockwork.  
既隐蔽又安静，厚厚的墙壁掩盖了声音，早上七点，这里会准时变得空无一人，像时钟一样准。

"You little-" Asuka grunted as she stomped on a dense bag she had prepared for today, "-Who do you think you are, huh?"  
“你这个小——”明日香哼了一声，踩在一个为今天准备的厚实袋子上，“——你以为你是谁啊？”

Her breathing became labored as she skidded on the concrete, "Who do you think you are!?"  
她的呼吸变得急促，在混凝土路面上滑行，“你以为你是谁！？”

The bag finally crumpled under the weight of her foot. Asuka wiped her damp forehead as she panted.  
袋子终于在她脚下被踩扁。明日香擦了擦湿润的额头，喘着气。

"Asuka?" A voice blurted out behind her.  
“明日香？”一个声音在她身后突然响起。

She recoiled, but Asuka didn't turn to face her visitor, the idiotic voice a dead give away. "...Third. What do you want?"  
"她退缩了一下，但明日香没有转身面对来访者，那愚蠢的声音已经暴露了一切。“……第三次了。你想要什么？””

Shinji walked up beside her. He looked down at the bag in his hand and gestured to it, "Oh, well, I guess to take out the garbage. You?"  
"真嗣走到她旁边。他低头看着手中的垃圾袋，示意道：“哦，嗯，我想是来倒垃圾的。你呢？””

"Some peace and quiet would be nice." Asuka reached to pick up the bag and haul it into the large bin.  
““有些宁静和平静会很好。”明日香伸手拿起垃圾袋，将其拖进大垃圾桶。”

"Yeah. All this training is pretty stressful." He attempted to toss the garbage bag into the bin, but utterly air-balled it instead.  
"是啊。所有这些训练都挺有压力的。" 他试图将垃圾袋扔进垃圾桶，结果却完全扔空了。

"Nice." “不错。”

"Sorry…" Shinji moved to properly dispose of the garbage. He stopped in front of Asuka, unsure what to do with his hands, "Your eye looks better now."  
"对不起……" 真嗣走过去妥善处理垃圾。他在明日香面前停下，不知双手该放哪里，"你的眼睛现在看起来好多了。"

"Yeah. I can see that."  
"嗯，我看得出来。"

"N-not that I knew you before, so I wouldn't know how it looked," Asuka didn't respond to him, her attention with some litter that she nudged at. "I didn't know you lived around here."

She dragged the litter with her foot, "I'm in the neighborhood."  
她用脚拖着那片垃圾，"我就在附近。"

"I see. Well," He looked down. "...Areyouhungry?"  
"我明白了。那么，"他低头看了一眼。"...你饿了吗？"

"Eh?" Asuka leaned with her hand cupped to ear, "Speak up, I can't hear you."  
“嗯？”明日香用手掌拢在耳边，“说大声点，我听不见。”

Shinji cleared his throat. "Are you hungry? I'm about to makesomebreakfast."  
真嗣清了清喉咙。“你饿了吗？我正要做点早餐。”

Asuka stared at him blankly, "Breakfast." After a moment she snorted, "Pfft. Yeah nice try, pervert." She turned around and walked away.  
明日香面无表情地盯着他，“早餐。”过了一会儿她嗤之以鼻，“噗。是啊，想得美，变态。”她转身走开了。

"I didn't mean it like that! I um, I'm making spicy omelettes. I thought you'd like it-"  
"我不是那个意思！呃，我在做辣味煎蛋。我以为你会喜欢——"

Her hair whipped around and struck his face, "Spicy?" Shinji could only stammer in retort. Asuka squinted suspiciously, "Did that deadbeat put you up to this?"  
她的头发甩动，打在他的脸上，“辣味？”真嗣只能结巴地反驳。明日香怀疑地眯起眼睛，“那个懒鬼让你这么做的？”

"Huh? Deadbeat?" "啊？懒鬼？"

"Misato. She did, didn't she?"  
"美里。她确实这么做了，不是吗？"

"No! I mean, she wants to see you, but she didn't ask me." She shook her head and brushed past Shinji and he followed. "I just wanted to, y'know, make you feel included."  
"不！我是说，她想见你，但她没让我来。" 她摇了摇头，从真嗣身边擦过，他跟着她。"我只是想，你知道的，让你感觉被包括进来。"

Asuka guffawed mockingly as she walked out of the garbage dump, "Included in what? Watching her get piss drunk all day, make promises she can't keep?"  
明日香嘲讽地大笑，一边走出垃圾堆，"被包括在什么里？看着她整天烂醉如泥，许下她无法兑现的承诺？"

Shinji attempted to catch up with her, "What's your problem with her? She's been nothing but nice to us."  
真嗣试图追上她，“你对她有什么不满？她对我们一直都很友好。”

"Yeah, cause she wants to impress the new kid on the block." Asuka glanced back at him. "You know what that is? It's called the honeymoon phase, genius. Once she gets bored, she'll forget you even exist." She began to walk faster, "I swear, she hasn't changed one bit…"  
“是啊，因为她想给新来的家伙留下好印象。”明日香回头瞥了他一眼，“你知道那叫什么吗？那叫蜜月期，天才。一旦她厌倦了，她甚至会忘记你的存在。”她加快了脚步，“我发誓，她一点都没变……”

"But she has! Ms. Misato told me what happened, and she's been trying to be better."  
“但她确实变了！美里小姐告诉我发生了什么，她一直在努力变得更好。”

Asuka stopped. She turned and stared at him, her resolve faltered, "She… told you?" A pout formed on her face, "Okay, fine, she's changed? What was the first thing she did when she brought you home?" Shinji opened his mouth, "Wait, wait, let me guess. She chugged a beer in ten seconds and screeched, right? A really loud one? Yeah, get used to that."  
明日香停下脚步，转过身盯着他，决心动摇了，“她……告诉你了？”她的嘴角微微下垂，“好吧，行，她变了？她带你回家后做的第一件事是什么？”真嗣张开嘴，“等等，等等，让我猜猜。她一口气喝完一瓶啤酒，然后尖叫，对吧？非常大声的那种？是啊，习惯就好。”

Shinji avoided eye contact with her. "I don't mind it. You know, a-at least she's relaxed enough to act like herself around me and talk things out." Shinji took a sharp breath, he would probably regret this, but it felt like the right thing to say, "Have you ever thought she might not be the problem here?"  
真嗣避开了她的目光。“我不介意。你知道，至少她在我面前能放松下来，做回自己，还能好好谈一谈。”真嗣深吸了一口气，他可能会后悔这么说，但感觉这是正确的话，“你有没有想过，问题可能不在她身上？”

"...Say again?" “……再说一遍？”

"It just sounds like you're holding a grudge because you're not willing to give her a second chance. Bonds like that, they're- You should cherish them while you still-"  
"听起来你只是因为不愿意给她第二次机会而心怀怨恨。这样的关系，它们——你应该珍惜它们，趁你还能——"

Asuka spoke over him. "Oh, I'm not holding a grudge. I just learned to get used to disappointment. Sure, it's fun hanging out with her. At first. Then you start to get burdensome, then you start to annoy her, then she'll drop you the first chance she gets."  
明日香打断了他。"哦，我没有心怀怨恨。我只是学会了习惯失望。当然，和她一起出去玩很有趣。一开始。然后你会变得累赘，然后开始惹她烦，然后她一有机会就会甩掉你。"

He waited for her to finish, "...She neglected you?"  
他等她说完，"...她忽视了你？"

Asuka snorted, "What? No? You really think I'd ever put up with that? No- but I was just a kid, she'd get wasted during the day, then she'd leave for a week so she could shack up with her deadbeat boyfriend!" She crossed her arms and looked away, "Unlike you, I actually have self respect."  
明日香哼了一声，“什么？不？你真以为我会忍受那种事？不——但我那时只是个孩子，她白天就喝得烂醉，然后一走就是一周，去跟她那无赖男友鬼混！”她交叉双臂，别过头去，“不像你，我可是有自尊的。”

Shinji looked away as well. She hasn't left yet, so he could only assume that Asuka waited for him to talk. "My father drinks as well. I don't think I've ever seen him drink water once." He let out a weak chuckle and looked at Asuka. But she seemed to be miles away. "And he's not a very good father either. I feel like I'm just a nurse to him sometimes. B-but that's okay, y'know? Because he's still there for me, in his own way, he tries. It's not normal, I know. But he's family, and I'm grateful for that." He attempted to meet her eyes, "I think you and Ms. Misato have that, all you need to do is talk. I think she's willing to try, you should too."  
真嗣也转过头去。她还没离开，所以他只能猜测明日香是在等他开口。“我父亲也喝酒。我想我从没见他喝过一次水。”他发出一声无力的轻笑，看向明日香。但她似乎心不在焉。“而且他也不是个好父亲。有时候我觉得自己只是他的护士。但——但这没关系，你知道吗？因为他还是以自己的方式在我身边，他尽力了。这并不正常，我知道。但他是家人，我对此心存感激。”他试图与她的目光相遇，“我想你和美里小姐也有这种关系，你们只需要沟通。我想她是愿意尝试的，你也应该如此。”

She glanced at him. "You really want to die on this hill, don't you? Okay." Asuka only knew this mouth breather for a month, but for some indescribable reason, he knew just exactly how to get under her skin. On the flip side, his nerves were an open book. "What, mommy never gave you enough hugs so you're okay with being a doormat? Pfft. Grow up."  
她瞥了他一眼。“你真的想在这座山上送命，对吧？好吧。”明日香只认识这个口呼吸的家伙一个月，但不知为何，他总能准确无误地惹恼她。另一方面，他的情绪却像一本翻开的书。“怎么，妈妈没给你足够的拥抱，所以你甘愿当个垫脚石？噗。成熟点吧。”

For the first time she met him, the seemingly toothless boy frowned, "...My mother died when I was four. Please don't make jokes like that."  
第一次见到他时，那个看似无害的男孩皱起了眉，“……我四岁时母亲就去世了。请不要开这种玩笑。”

A stone dropped in her stomach. "Wow, I really am good." Asuka turned to walk away, "And they said Freud was a fraud."  
她的心里像坠了一块石头。“哇，我真是厉害。”明日香转身离开，“他们还说弗洛伊德是个骗子呢。”

Shinji stood there as she walked away, she smirked at the prospect of winning the last- "That's easy for you to say, at least you have a mother!" He shouted out. "You don't know what it's like!"  
真嗣站在那里，看着她走远，她对赢得最后的机会暗自得意——“你说得倒轻松，至少你还有妈妈！”他大声喊道。“你不知道那是什么感觉！”

Asuka froze. 明日香僵住了。

"Wait, I'm just trying to say that- I don't know. I don't know what your life is like. And I might not know a whole lot, but when you lose someone like that, someone who cares about you as much as she does, it leaves a mark. Forever."  
“等等，我只是想说——我不知道。我不了解你的生活。也许我知道的不多，但当你失去那样一个人，一个像她那样关心你的人，那会留下痕迹。永远的。”

"..."

Asuka turned around and marched towards Shinji.  
明日香转过身，大步向真嗣走去。

"And then when she's gone, every day you're gonna wish that you cherished those moments. Please, for your sake, just talk to-"  
“然后当她离开时，每一天你都会希望自己曾珍惜那些时光。为了你自己，就请去和她谈谈吧——”

She grabbed his collar and jabbed a finger in his face. "Listen to me very carefully, because I'm only going to say it once." Asuka said calmly. "You're right. You don't know me, don't act like you know me. You know why? Because we're not friends. You got that? I'm not your buddy, I'm your co-worker." Asuka avoided eye contact. "I don't like you. You irritate me. That's it, end of story."  
她抓住他的衣领，用手指戳着他的脸。“仔细听好，因为我只说一次。”明日香平静地说道，“你说得对。你不了解我，别装作了解我。你知道为什么吗？因为我们不是朋友。明白了吗？我不是你的伙伴，我只是你的同事。”明日香避开了眼神接触，“我不喜欢你。你让我感到烦躁。就这样，故事结束。”

Shinji gulped, "But, w-when we, you were nice-"  
真嗣咽了口唾沫，“但是，我们，你那时很友善——”

"Yeah, no shit. I was in front of my boss. Of course I'm going to act professionally in front of my boss! I don't know why she wants us all to get along. You're probably gonna be dead by the end of the month anyways, why even bother? It's all just so you don't chicken out-"  
“是啊，废话。我在老板面前。当然要在老板面前表现得专业！我不知道她为什么非要我们和睦相处。反正你月底可能就死了，何必费这个劲？这一切不过是为了让你不临阵退缩——”

"I'm not scared..." “我不害怕……”

Asuka pulled at his collar even tighter, "You should be! Cause I'm not always gonna be there to babysit you, and when they get their hands on you…" She leaned closer, her face inches away from his, Shinji broke free from her grasp and backed away. Asuka followed as they circled around the depot. "You'll wish you could run away. Do you even know what they look like?"  
明日香更加用力地拽紧他的衣领，“你应该明白！因为我不会总是有空来照顾你，当他们抓住你的时候……”她凑得更近，脸几乎贴着他的，真嗣挣脱她的手，向后退去。明日香紧随其后，两人绕着仓库转圈。“你会希望自己能逃走的。你甚至知道他们长什么样吗？”

"I saw the concept projections of Sham-"  
“我看过沙姆的概念投影——”

"Yeah, I thought the same too!" Asuka lunged to shove him, which he narrowly dodged. "Trust me, I'm doing you a favour, Third! Step into that EVA, and you're walking into a world of hurt. It's going to be ugly. You're not just gonna die. They'll rip you to bits first, skewer you, eat you alive! And Ms. Misato won't be there to rescue you." She stared at Shinji, who stopped in his place. "Just go. Run away. Go home or- anywhere." Her eyebrows creased ever so slightly, "Just get the hell out of here."  
“是啊，我也这么想！”明日香猛地扑过去推他，他险险躲开。“相信我，我这是为你好，三号！踏进那台 EVA，你就踏入了一个充满痛苦的世界。那会很丑陋。你不会只是死掉。他们会先把你撕成碎片，串起来，活生生吃掉！而美里小姐不会在那里救你。”她盯着真嗣，他停下了脚步。“走吧。逃跑吧。回家或者——去任何地方。”她的眉头微微皱起，“只是赶紧离开这里。”

The two stared at each other for a long time.  
两人长时间地凝视着对方。

"I-." Shinji finally said. "-I can't. I have to protect Ayanami."  
"我-." 真嗣终于开口道。 "-我不能。我必须保护绫波。"

Asuka took a step back. and scoffed, "You just don't get it, do you? There's nothing to protect. She's just a doll, you moron. If you really think you have a chance with her-"  
明日香后退一步，嗤之以鼻，"你根本就不明白，是吧？没有什么需要保护的。她只是个玩偶，你这个笨蛋。如果你真的以为自己有机会和她在一起-"

"-It's not about that!" "-不是那个问题！"

"Then what!?" "-那是什么！？"

A deafening alarm blared through the city that caused the two to look up.  
一阵震耳欲聋的警报声响彻全城，使得两人抬头望去。

She stared at him, unrelenting, "Then what?"  
她盯着他，毫不退让，“那又怎样？”

He didn't respond, he only stared back.  
他没有回应，只是回望着她。

Asuka looked down for a moment, then stood aside and invited him to the subway station. "Last chance. I wouldn't tell anyone I saw you leave."  
明日香低头片刻，随即侧身让开，邀请他前往地铁站。“最后的机会。我不会告诉任何人我看到你离开。”

Shinji's fists clenched, his lips pressed tightly together as he stared her down, "I'm not going anywhere." He walked past her, what he said was nearly inaudible from the alarm, but it shot through her all the same.  
真嗣的拳头紧握，双唇紧闭，目光如炬地盯着她，“我不会离开的。”他从她身边走过，尽管警报声几乎淹没了他的话语，但那句话却如利箭般穿透了她。

"We should hurry, Langley."  
“我们得快点，兰格利。”

As he ran past Asuka, he pulled something with him, something intangible. A surprise she never knew existed, gone with the squall of the wind, it left her with an empty feeling she forgot was even there.  
当他跑过明日香时，他带走了某种无形的东西。一个她从未知晓的惊喜，随着风声消逝，留下了一种她早已遗忘的空虚感。

And it made her scared. "...That's not-" She attempted quietly before she let the words disappear.  
这让她感到害怕。“……那不是——”她轻声尝试反驳，却让话语消散在空气中。

She stared at the vacant skyscrapers, they blared with red lights and shifted and melded together. The rising sun coupled with the alarm lights nearly scoured the city crimson.  
她凝视着空荡荡的摩天大楼，它们闪烁着红灯，相互交错融合。初升的太阳与警报灯交相辉映，几乎将城市染成一片血红。

This is all wrong. Nothing here is right, it's all twisted.  
这一切都不对劲。这里的一切都不正常，全都扭曲了。

The only thing that stood out in this red hellhole was that stupid, baggy white shirt Shinji wore. It flapped in the wind as the unathletic boy jogged with gusto.  
在这片红色的地狱中，唯一显眼的就是真嗣那件愚蠢的、宽松的白色衬衫。它随风飘扬，而那个不擅长运动的男孩却充满活力地慢跑着。

Asuka gulped. "...What an idiot."  
明日香咽了咽口水。"...真是个白痴。"

---

They didn't run for long.  
他们并没有跑太久。

Before they could make it to Misato's, a black car with tinted windows drove in front of the sidewalk. Shinji assumed they were being kidnapped until Asuka nonchalantly barked at the Section-02 agent in the passenger seat to get out, so she could ride shotgun.  
在他们能到达美里家之前，一辆黑色车窗的轿车停在了人行道前。真嗣以为他们要被绑架了，直到明日香若无其事地对副驾驶座上的第二支部特工喊了一声下车，好让她坐上副驾驶。

The drive to the Geofront was exceptionally uncomfortable.  
前往地底都市的旅程异常尴尬。

Shinji's nerves only grew more finely wound while he waited by the cages with Naoko and Asuka. His brand new green plug suit with a gold trim chafed his skin. The Commander took her leisurely time to give a motivating speech on how they were the last hope of humanity, even as the alarms blared and Ms. Ibuki warned of the Angel's approach.  
真嗣在笼子旁等待着直子和明日香时，他的神经愈发紧绷。他那件崭新的绿色插入栓服，金色镶边摩擦着他的皮肤。指挥官不紧不慢地发表了一番激励演讲，说他们是人类最后的希望，尽管警报声大作，伊吹摩耶小姐警告着使徒的逼近。

After a tense sprint to the ambush site, the two EVA's skidded to a stop and…  
在紧张地冲向伏击地点后，两台 EVA 猛地刹住，然后……

…Were told to wait on standby.  
……被告知原地待命。

The two EVA's stood in front of the Odawara Coast, in an uncomfortable silence that could only be found in an elevator.  
两台 EVA 站在小田原海岸前，陷入了一种只有在电梯里才能感受到的不自在沉默。

While the rusted Unit-01 faced the horizon, Unit-02 leaned sideways. Her pallet rifle nestled in between her crossed arms. The silence was only broken by her occasional sniffs.  
当锈迹斑斑的零号机面对着地平线时，二号机侧身倚靠。她的弹匣步枪夹在交叉的双臂之间。四周的寂静只被她偶尔的抽鼻声打破。

Shinji hadn't seen a beach for nearly six years, and chose to admire its beauty and not the irritated girl beside him inside the weapon of mass destruction.  
真嗣已有近六年未曾见过海滩，他选择欣赏其美景，而非身旁那位在毁灭性武器中烦躁不安的女孩。

His feet felt cold from the water, even while inside Unit-01 and the LCL. When his feet shifted, he could feel the water travel into the cracks of his armour plates.  
尽管身处零号机和 LCL 之中，他的双脚仍因海水而感到冰冷。每当他移动双脚，都能感觉到水流渗入装甲板的缝隙。

Regardless, none of this could alleviate his anxiety. The city's edge was only a minute's sprint away. If the Angel came just a bit closer in than they anticipated, people could get caught in the crossfire.  
尽管如此，这一切都无法缓解他的焦虑。城市的边缘只需一分钟就能冲刺到达。如果使徒比他们预想的更靠近一些，人们可能会被卷入交火之中。

"_Commander,"_ Ritsuko called out through the comms, "_Angel is an estimated two hundred klicks away from Odawara Coast."_  
“指挥官，”律子通过通讯器呼叫，“使徒距离小田原海岸大约两百公里。”

Naoko cleared her throat through the comms. "_Okay kids, you've seen the projections. It'll be a flying object. You can't miss it. Now, Shinji…"_ She said in a serious tone, "_I don't want any heroics from you on your first day. Your job is to be on support for Asuka while she focuses on destroying the Angel's core. We're also near one of the fallout shelters. If there's any stragglers nearby, I need you to escort them to safety."_  
直子清了清嗓子，通过通讯器说道：“好了，孩子们，你们已经看过预测了。它会是一个飞行物体，你们不会错过的。现在，真嗣……”她语气严肃地说，“我不希望你在第一天就做出什么英雄行为。你的任务是支援明日香，让她专注于摧毁使徒的核心。我们附近也有一个避难所。如果有附近落单的人，我需要你护送他们到安全地带。”

Unit-01 nodded, "Yes 'mam.."  
初号机点了点头，“是的，女士..”

Asuka turned to him, "_Yeah, you hear that? Don't go charging in, new kid. I don't want you trying to take credit for my victory."_  
明日香转向他，“是吧，你听到了吗？别贸然冲进去，新人。我可不想你抢了我的胜利功劳。”

"_Come now, Asuka. Be nice."_ The Commander cooed.  
“来吧，明日香。友好点。”指挥官轻声哄道。

"_Commander!"_ Ritsuko shouted, "_Fifty klicks!"_  
"指挥官！" 律子喊道，"五十公里！"

"_Good luck, kids. This is it!"_  
"祝你们好运，孩子们。就是现在！"

Asuka cracked her neck and aimed her pallet rifle at the sky, "_Chance…"_  
明日香扭了扭脖子，将卡宾枪对准天空，"机会……"

"_Twenty-five klicks!"_  "二十五公里！"

Shinji surveyed with his rifle, but found no flying objects among the clear skies, "_Five klicks!"_  
真嗣用步枪扫视了一番，但在晴朗的天空中并未发现飞行物，“五公里！”

"_It's supposed to be right in front of us."_ Asuka turned to Shinji, "_Do you see it?"_  
“应该就在我们前面。”明日香转向真嗣，“你看到了吗？”

Unit-01 whipped its head around in search of the Angel, "N-no! Where-" He spun backwards, "-Is it invisible?"  
初号机猛地转头寻找使徒，“不——不！在哪——”他向后转去，“它是隐形的吗？”

Asuka scoffed, "_What are you, stupid?"_ She looked down at her feet. "_It's down here!"_  
明日香嗤之以鼻，“你是不是傻？”她低头看向自己的脚，“在这下面！”

"Where?" “哪里？”

"_What do you think 'down' means?"_  
"你觉得'down'是什么意思？"

Shinji turned back to see the tiny Angel below their feet. "Ah!"  
真嗣转过身，看到脚下那只小小的使徒。"啊！"

Above the shore's surface, a purple V-shaped head with two eyes stared at them blankly."Wait… why isn't it attacking us?"  
在海岸表面之上，一个紫色的 V 形头部，两只眼睛茫然地盯着他们。"等等……它为什么不攻击我们？"

Asuka snorted, "_Who cares?"_ Unit-02 aimed her rifle.  
明日香嗤之以鼻，“谁在乎？”二号机举起了她的步枪。

Unit-01 grabbed 02's rifle, "Wait!"  
初号机抓住了二号机的步枪，“等等！”

She yanked it out of his grip, "_What? Why?"_  
她从他手中猛地抽出步枪，“什么？为什么？”

"It's just a head!" Shinji pointed to the head, which sunk slightly lower into the water.  
"“这只是个头！” 真嗣指着那个头，它稍微沉入了水中。”

Unit-02 stared at him in disbelief, her body hunched over, "_...No, you retard!"_ She pointed at the Angel with her rifle, "_It's swimming."_  
"二号机难以置信地盯着他，身体蜷缩着，“……不，你这个白痴！”她用步枪指着使徒，“它在游泳。””

"_Why isn't it attacking?"_ Ritsuko asked through the comm.  
"“为什么它不攻击？” 律子通过通讯问道。”

"_I don't know…"_ The Commander responded, "_But I really don't appreciate that language, Asuka."_  
"我不知道……" 指挥官回应道，"但我不太喜欢那种说法，明日香。"

Shamshel blinked innocently at the two EVAs.  
夏姆榭尔无辜地眨了眨眼，看着两台 EVA。

Unit-01 tilted it's head. "You know, I think it might be shy-"  
初号机歪了歪头。"你知道吗，我觉得它可能有点害羞-"

He was interrupted when Asuka shoved him aside, and opened fire on Shamshel's head with her pallet rifle.  
他正说着，却被明日香一把推开，她用卡宾枪对准萨姆沙尔的头部开火了。

The Angel seemed unbothered by this. It easily deflected the gunfire with its AT field and simply blinked.  
使徒对此似乎毫不在意。它轻松地用 AT 力场弹开了子弹，只是眨了眨眼。

"Wait, don't!" Shinji yelped, "Maybe it's intelligent!"  
“等等，别开枪！”真嗣大喊，“也许它是有智慧的！”

"_It's about as smart as you!"_  
"它跟你一样聪明！"

"_There's no time to think, Shinji. Shoot it!"_ Misato shouted through the comms.  
"没时间思考了，真嗣。开火！" 美里通过通讯器喊道。

Shigeru Aoba joined in on the peanut gallery. "_Maybe the new kid's right. It could be trying to communicate with us."_ Asuka ignored them as she reloaded her rifle and continued to open fire, with some stomps at Shamshel's head for good measure.  
青叶茂也加入了旁观者的行列。"也许新人说得对。它可能在试图与我们交流。" 明日香无视他们，重新装填了步枪，继续开火，还不忘对着萨姆沙尔的头部狠狠踩上几脚。

Smoke formed from the gunfire. Aoba chuckled. "_Heh-hey, you know, it's actually kinda cute-"_ Shamshel rose from the shore, water spilled off it as it revealed its massive, phallic, vaginal, centipede like appearance and hissed, "_-Oh my god!"_  
枪火中升起烟雾。Aoba 轻笑道：“嘿嘿，你知道吗，这其实有点可爱——”沙姆沙尔从岸边升起，水珠从它那巨大、似阳具、似阴道的蜈蚣般身躯上滑落，发出嘶嘶声，“——我的天哪！”

The Angel lunged at Asuka, which she deflected with an AT field. The Angel flew backwards and landed on its back. The writhing mass thrashed wildly.  
使徒向明日香扑去，被她用 AT 力场挡开。使徒倒飞出去，背部着地，那扭曲的躯体疯狂地挣扎着。

Two long, glowing pink tendrils flailed out of Shamshels body, struck the water and parted under its sheer force.  
两条长长的、发着粉光的触须从沙姆沙尔的身体中甩出，击打在水面上，强大的力量使其分开。

It's tendrils raised in a deimatic display as Shamshel hissed. The red core tucked underneath it's head blared furiously, which blinded Shinji.  
它的触须高高举起，呈现出威吓的姿态，沙姆谢尔发出嘶嘶声。隐藏在它头部下方的红色核心愤怒地闪烁着，令真嗣目眩。

He stood, paralyzed. The LCL inside the entry plug turned cold. When Shamshel raised it's tendrils at the two, he did not react. "_Move it, idiot!"_ Asuka shouted in between gunshots. At the last second, he was shoved out of the way by Asuka. "_Are you deaf? I told you to-"_  
他僵立不动。插入栓内的 LCL 变得冰冷。当沙姆谢尔向两人举起触须时，他毫无反应。“动起来，白痴！”明日香在枪声中喊道。最后一刻，他被明日香推开。“你聋了吗？我告诉过你——”

"_Umbilical cables severed!"_ Hyuga called out. "_Four minutes and fifty nine seconds until deactivation!"_  
“脐带电缆被切断！”日向呼喊道，“四分五十九秒后将自动停机！”

Both EVA's slowly looked down at the power cables plugged to their back, now only sparkling stumps. The very ground around them was carved in by the Angel's energy tendrils.  
两架 EVA 缓缓低头看向插在背上的电源线，如今只剩下闪烁的残端。就连它们周围的地面也被使徒的能量触须刻画得沟壑纵横。

Unit-02 shoved Unit-01, "_Now look at what you did-"_ Asuka was interrupted by another assault of Shamshel's tendrils. This time, she grabbed onto the tendrils, unphased by them melting in her grip as they carved it's way into Unit-02's hands. "_-You idiot!"_  
零二号机猛推零一号机，“现在看看你干的好事——”明日香被另一波使徒的触手攻击打断。这次，她抓住了触手，尽管它们在她的握力下融化并刻入零二号机的手掌，她却毫不在意。“-你这个白痴！”

Shinji stood there, hands trembling as he watched the two struggle.  
真嗣站在那里，双手颤抖着，看着两机搏斗。

"_Shinji?"_ Misato said through the comms, "_Shinji!"_  
“真嗣？”美里通过通讯器喊道，“真嗣！”

Asuka wound the tendrils along her forearms so she could get closer to Shamshel, "_Make yourself useful, Third!"_  
明日香将触手缠绕在她的前臂上，以便更接近夏姆谢尔，“发挥点作用吧，第三适格者！”

Unit-01 glanced at the city. Shinji squinted as he caught something among the skyscrapers and gasped.  
初号机瞥了一眼城市。真嗣眯起眼睛，在摩天大楼间捕捉到了什么，倒吸了一口气。

He dropped his rifle. 他丢下了步枪。

---

"What the hell is he doing!?" Misato exclaimed as she watched Shinji break into a sprint past Asuka and Shamshel, right towards the city. She flipped the comm switch, "Shinji!"  
“他到底在搞什么鬼！？”美里惊呼，看着真嗣从明日香和萨姆沙身边疾跑而过，直奔城市而去。她迅速切换通讯频道，“真嗣！”

Shigeru Aoba pointed at his monitor, "I think it's okay!" He offered, "He's just going for one of the weapon depots-" Unit-01 sprinted right past the armoury building. "-Oh, no, never mind. We got a runner."  
青木茂指着他的显示器，“我觉得没问题！”他提议道，“他只是去拿武器——”初号机径直跑过了军械库建筑。“——哦，不，算了。我们有麻烦了。”

"_What the shit, Third!?"_ Asuka exclaimed as she was thrashed side by side.  
“搞什么鬼，三号！？”明日香和她一起被甩得东倒西歪。

Naoko leaned in, "That's okay, Shinji! If you feel like you need a minute, don't force yourself-"  
直子靠近了些，“没关系，真嗣！如果你觉得需要休息一下，别勉强自己——”

"_Are you kidding me!?"_  "你在开玩笑吧！？"

Shinji flipped on his comm switch. "_It's not like that, Ms. Naoko! There's civilians on the outskirts, by the skyscraper!"_  
真嗣打开了通讯开关。“不是那样的，直子小姐！摩天大楼附近有平民！”

"That can wait, Shinji!" Misato respond, "Asuka needs you-"  
“那可以等会儿再说，真嗣！”美里回应，“明日香需要你——”

"_Like hell I do!"_ Asuka shouted, "_I don't need him!"_  
“我才不需要他！”明日香大喊，“我绝对不需要他！”

Kyoko shoved Misato aside and spoke into the comms, "Langley, focus."  
绫子将美里推到一边，对着通讯器说道：“兰格雷，集中注意力。”

Shamshel grabbed Unit-02's ankles with it's tendrils, and with a single spin, it threw Asuka into the sky.  
萨姆谢尔用它的触手抓住了二号机的脚踝，一个旋转，将明日香抛向了空中。

"Never be afraid to ask for help, Asuka!" Naoko called out.  
"永远不要害怕寻求帮助，明日香！" 直子喊道。

Unit-02 flailed in the air briefly before Asuka plummeted into the water.  
二号机在空中短暂挣扎后，明日香便一头栽进了水中。

With incredible speed, Shamshel rippled through the water as it swam towards Asuka. It wrapped its energy tendrils around Unit-02, which seared into it's armour. Yet no cry was elicited from Asuka.  
沙姆沙尔以惊人的速度在水面波动前行，向明日香游去。它用能量触须缠绕住二号机，灼烧着它的装甲。然而，明日香并未发出一声呼喊。

Shamshel attempted to drown Unit-02 in the ocean with a death roll akin to a crocodile's.  
萨姆谢尔试图像鳄鱼一样用死亡翻滚将二号机淹没在海中。

"_Asuka, hang on, I swear I'll be right there!"_ Shinji shouted as Unit-01 skidded to a stop in front of the skyscraper.  
“明日香，坚持住，我发誓我马上就到！”真嗣大喊着，初号机在摩天大楼前急停。

"_Drop - dead!"_ Asuka shouted back in between gasps of air.  
“去死吧！”明日香在喘息间回喊道。

"Don't worry, Shinji!" The Commander said, "You're doing great!"  
"别担心，真嗣！" 司令官说道，"你做得很好！"

---

"It's gonna kill us!" Toji pointed to the massive EVA that sprinted towards their skyscraper.  
"它会杀了我们的！" 东治指着那台向他们所在的高楼疾驰而来的巨大 EVA。

Kensuke kept his camera perfectly in frame as the pale purple titan skidded to a stop in front of them. Focus was nice, rule of thirds was in place…  
健介稳稳地端着相机，将那尊苍紫色的巨人急停在他们面前的画面完美捕捉。焦点清晰，三分法则恰到好处……

"Ken, move it!" Toji grabbed Kensuke's jacket.  
“阿 Ken，快点！” 冬二抓住了健司的夹克。

"Wait- wait!" He hissed. The EVA stopped, it's hand stretched out invitingly towards them, a massive cloud of dust formed behind him. In the background within the ocean, the other EVA wrestled with the pink monstrosity. Kensuke grinned, "And… cut!"  
“等等——等等！”他低声说道。EVA 停了下来，它的手向他们伸展开来，仿佛在邀请，身后扬起了一大片尘土。在远处的海中，另一台 EVA 正与那粉红色的怪物搏斗。健司咧嘴一笑，“然后……咔！”

The EVA's hand inched closer to them and made the two boys back away. A deep, modulated voice blared out of the EVA. "**CHILDREN. CLIMB ON."** Kensuke and Toji covered their ears.  
EVA 的手缓缓逼近，使得两个男孩不由自主地后退。一个深沉、经过调制的声音从 EVA 中传出：“孩子们，爬上来。” 真希波和东治捂住了耳朵。

Back into the ocean, an explosion went off and with it, showering debris. The EVA shielded them from a boulder that fell their way.  
海中再次发生爆炸，碎片四溅。EVA 用身体为他们挡住了一块坠向他们的巨石。

"**HURRY!"**  “快点！”

Kensuke hid the camera behind his back, "Sir, I swear, we were just out looking for Toji's sister!"  
健介把相机藏在背后，“长官，我发誓，我们只是出来找冬治的妹妹！”

"You're pinning this on me!? You just wanted to get a shot of the action!"  
"你把这事儿赖我头上！？你只是想拍点儿刺激的镜头吧！"

"**CLIMB. NOW."** The two scrambled into the palm of the EVA's hand without hesitation. "**SORRY!"**  
"快爬上来。现在。"" 两人毫不犹豫地爬进了 EVA 的手掌。""对不起！"

Everything went dark. It used it's other hand to cup the two boys into a sort of dome.  
一切陷入黑暗。EVA 用另一只手将两个男孩护在一个类似穹顶的结构中。

Toji glanced at Kensuke, "Sorry?"  
冬二瞥了一眼真希，"抱歉？"

He nudged Toji's shoulder, their bodies jostled from the EVA's run. "I told you it was him!" Kensuke looked up at the top of the EVA's hand, "Hey, you're that new kid, Ikari, aren't you?"  
他轻推冬二的肩膀，两人因 EVA 的奔跑而身体摇晃。"我告诉过你就是他！"真希抬头望向 EVA 的手掌上方，"嘿，你就是那个新来的孩子，碇，对吧？"

"**N-NO. I HAVE NO IDEA WHO THAT IS."**  
"不-不是的。我根本不知道那是谁。"

The sprinting EVA skidded to another stop. Kensuke and Toji flew onto the other side of the domed hand. They felt it's hands go lower down as wind rushed through the EVA's fingertips.  
疾驰的 EVA 猛地刹住，健介和渡治被甩到了巨掌的另一侧。他们感觉到那双手缓缓下沉，风从 EVA 的指尖呼啸而过。

Suddenly, a blinding light struck their eyes as the EVA lifted it's hand to reveal the fallout bunker they snuck out of. "**GET INSIDE. YOU WILL BE SAFE THERE."** The EVA stepped back and turned away from them, but paused. It looked down at the two, "**NERV THANKS YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION."**  
突然，一道刺眼的光芒射入他们的眼睛，EVA 抬起手，露出了他们偷偷溜出的避难所。“快进去，那里安全。”EVA 后退并转身离开，却又停下，低头看着两人，“NERV 感谢你们的合作。”

The EVA ran away from the bunker, towards a skyscraper and pulled out two massive cables.  
EVA 逃离了掩体，朝着一座摩天大楼奔去，并抽出了两条巨大的电缆。

The two stood there, frozen in utter confusion as they tried to regain their balance. Toji gasped for air as he leaned against the entrance to the shelter.  
两人站在那里，完全困惑地僵住了，试图恢复平衡。真嗣靠在避难所的入口处，大口喘着气。

Kensuke blinked, "Holy shit…" He looked down at his camera, "I got all of that!" He lifted the camera to the sky, "I got it!"  
健介眨了眨眼，"天哪…"他低头看着自己的相机，"我全都拍到了！"他举起相机对准天空，"我拍到了！"

"It really was him." Toji said. He looked back out to the city to see Shinji sprint towards the action, two cables in either hand. "Yeah, Shin-man!" He whooped, "Yeah! Kick it's ass!"  
"真的是他。"冬二说道。他回头望向城市，看到真嗣手持两条电缆，疾速冲向战场。"没错，真哥！"他欢呼道，"加油！干掉它！"

---

The lights inside her EVA blared red. "_Unit-02 operational time limit at thirty seconds!"_ Ritsuko warned through the comms.  
她 EVA 内部的灯光闪烁着红色。“二号机操作时间限制还剩三十秒！”通过通讯器，律子警告道。

"_Asuka!"_ Misato's voice nagged in her ear, "_Get out of there and regroup with Shinji!"_  
“明日香！”美里在她的耳边催促，“快出来，和真嗣重新集结！”

"No!" She shouted back. Both of Unit-02's arms were wrapped tightly by Shamshel's tendrils, she fought to reach for her prog-knife, "I can still win!"  
“不！”她回喊道。零二号机的双臂被夏姆谢尔的触手紧紧缠绕，她挣扎着去够她的程序刀，“我还能赢！”

Unit-02 fell backwards into the water, the Angel stood at it's full height and towered over her.  
零二号机向后跌入水中，使徒站立起来，高达全高，俯视着她。

"_Twenty seconds!"_ “二十秒！”

"_Dammit, Asuka, now!"_  “该死，明日香，现在！”

"_Come on, Asuka!"_ The Commander encouraged through the comms, "_You can do it!"_  
"加油，明日香！" 指挥官通过通讯器鼓励道，"你能做到的！"

A fire welled through her, the LCL boiled as Asuka fought to wrap the knife around her fingers.  
一股力量在她体内涌动，LCL 溶液沸腾起来，明日香努力将刀刃缠绕在手指上。

"_Ten seconds!"_  "十秒！"

The energy tendrils shot through her chest and shoulder, her hands free. "Now I got you!"  
能量触须穿透她的胸膛和肩膀，她的双手得以自由。“现在我抓到你了！”

Asuka's knife struck at Shamshel's core, but only scratched the surface. She began to feel her vision blur, her breathing ragged. "One… more!"  
明日香的刀刺向夏姆谢尔的核心，却只划破了表面。她开始感到视线模糊，呼吸急促。“再来一次！”

"_Five… four-"_  "五…四-"

"Come on!"  "快点！"

"_Three-"_  “三——”

A second knife lodged into Shamshel's core, sparks flew out and it's blaring red light suddenly flickered. The Angel fell backwards and spasmed.  
又一把刀刺入 Shamshel 的核心，火花四溅，它那刺眼的红光突然闪烁起来。天使向后倒下，抽搐着。

Then it became still, dead in the water.  
然后它静止了，死在水面上。

She felt the stump of her umbilical cable get ripped out, and replaced with a new one as a surge energy rushed through her. "_Power restored!"_ The lights inside her EVA went back to normal.  
她感觉到脐带电缆的残端被猛地拔出，随即被一根新的电缆替换，一股能量涌入体内。“电力恢复了！”她驾驶的 EVA 内部灯光也恢复了正常。

"...Eh?" “……诶？”

Asuka surveyed her surroundings, they were only a few steps away from Tokyo-03's outskirts. The very ground was carved in slices, water from the nearby shore flooded the lacerations and extinguished the immolated surface. She looked up to see Unit-01 stare at the Angel, arms stretched out wide in confusion. He… stole her kill?  
明日香环顾四周，他们距离东京-03 的郊区仅几步之遥。地面被切割成片，附近海岸的水涌入裂缝，熄灭了燃烧的表面。她抬头看到初号机盯着使徒，双臂困惑地张开。他……抢了她的击杀？

He stole my kill. 他抢了我的击杀。

Asuka's jaw dropped. She fumed. "You…"  
明日香的下巴掉了下来。她怒火中烧。“你……”

"_You did it!"_ The Commander cheered. "_You defeated the Angel! I knew I picked a winner!"_  
“你做到了！”指挥官欢呼道，“你击败了使徒！我就知道我选对了人！”

Wait.

"_He did it."_ Misato exhaled sharply. "_He actually did it."_  
"他做到了。" 美里深吸一口气。"他真的做到了。"

Unit-01 looked at the Shamshel's corpse, then at his hands. "_I… did?_" Shinji threw his arms up, "_I did it!"_ From within her EVA, Unit-01 looked down at Asuka, "_I mean- we, you mostly-"_  
初号机看着沙姆谢尔的尸体，然后看了看自己的双手。"我……做到了？" 真嗣举起双臂，"我做到了！" 从她的 EVA 里，初号机低头看着明日香，"我是说——我们，主要是你——"

He thinks I'm pathetic. 他认为我可悲。

"_That's score number two for humanity!"_ Naoko exclaimed through the comms, and in the background, the NERV crew cheered in response. "_Shinji just saved humanity from extinction, and on his first try too!" Naoko pressed on the intercom, "What do you have to say to him?"_  
“这是人类第二次得分了！”直子通过通讯器兴奋地说，背景中 NERV 的工作人员也跟着欢呼起来。“真嗣第一次尝试就拯救了人类免于灭绝！”直子继续对着对讲机说，“你想对他说些什么？”

The hidden skyscrapers raised back up to the sky and rejoined the non essentials. A camera feed of the NERV crew showed up on her visuals, they were clapping. "_Asuka, Shinji, you did it!"_ Maya Ibuki called out. "_Congratulations!"_  
隐藏的摩天大楼重新升向天空，与非必需品再次连接。她的视觉中出现了 NERV 队员们的摄像头画面，他们正在鼓掌。“明日香，真嗣，你们做到了！”伊吹玛亚喊道，“祝贺你们！”

No.

"_Congratulations! You're number one!_""  
"恭喜！你是第一名！""

The skyscrapers casted a shadow against the rising sun and they overlapped over the two EVAs.  
摩天大楼在初升的太阳下投下阴影，这些阴影交叠在两台 EVA 上。

"_Great job, kid!"_  "干得漂亮，孩子！""

A random voice off to the distance let out a hoot, "_Hell yea, Shin-man!"_  
远处一个随意的声音发出一声欢呼，“太棒了，真人大哥！”

Unit-01 spun around, unsure what to do with his hands. She could feel his smile through his radio line. "_Thank you!"_  
初号机转过身来，不知双手该往哪儿放。她能通过无线电感受到他的笑容。“谢谢你！”

After a moment, the lavender EVA looked down at Unit-02 and offered it's hand, "_Are you okay?"_  
片刻后，紫色的 EVA 低头看向二号机，伸出手问道，“你还好吗？”

"_Congratulations!"_ "恭喜！"

She stood on her own two feet and stared at Unit-01. Through the camera feed, she attempted to stare daggers through to Shinji, who smiled innocently, his hand still extended.  
她独自站立，凝视着初号机。通过摄像头，她试图用目光刺穿到真嗣，他无辜地微笑着，手依然伸着。

He read the scornful expression on her face, and his smile slowly dropped.  
他读出了她脸上的轻蔑表情，笑容渐渐消失。

"_Asuka…"_ Misato warned. “明日香……”美里警告道。

"What was the one thing I told you not to do?" She said, her breath shaken.  
"我告诉过你不要做的一件事是什么？" 她说，呼吸颤抖。

"_Congratulations!"_  "恭喜！"

"_H-huh?"_  "诶？"

Asuka batted away his hand, and the cheering stopped, replaced with confused murmurs. "The one thing, what was it?"  
明日香挥开了他的手，欢呼声戛然而止，取而代之的是困惑的低语。 "那一件事，是什么来着？"

Unit-01 shook its head, "_I don't- I was trying to help-"_  
初号机摇了摇头，“我不——我是在试图帮忙——”

"Did I ask you for your help_!?"_ She shoved him in response, "That was my mark! Mine!"  
"我求你帮忙了吗！？" 她回应着推了他一把，"那是我的猎物！我的！"

"_Asuka, what on earth are you doing!?"_ The Commander exclaimed. "_This isn't like you."_  
"明日香，你到底在干什么！？" 指挥官惊呼道，"这不像你。"

Ritsuko sighed through the comms, "_She's right. If he didn't interfere, you would've died."_  
律子通过通讯叹了口气，"她说得对。如果他没有干预，你早就死了。"

"That's not true! I had it! I-" Unit-02 grabbed a nearby tree that stood at her knees and yanked it out from its roots. She flung it into the ocean and stumbled with the toss, "-Fucking had it!"  
"不是这样的！我有！我——" 二号机抓住旁边一棵齐膝高的树，连根拔起。她将树甩进海里，踉跄了一下，"——他妈的有！"

It plummeted loudly into the ocean.  
它轰然坠入海中。

Asuka reached for another tree, a larger one that reached her waist. She ripped it out and used it as a makeshift club. Unit-02 readied to swing at a nearby skyscraper-  
明日香又伸手去抓另一棵树，一棵齐腰高的大树。她将其拔出，当作临时的棍棒。二号机准备向附近的一座摩天大楼挥去——

She was stopped by Unit-01, who grabbed her shoulder. "_Don't!"_ Shinji called from inside.  
她被初号机拦下，后者抓住了她的肩膀。“别去！”真嗣从驾驶舱内喊道。

Unit-02 whipped back, and the club loomed over Shinji, ready to strike. Unit-01 flinched.  
二号机猛地转身，俱乐部高悬在真嗣上方，准备挥下。初号机不禁一颤。

Asuka froze. Shinji stared at her pleadingly through the visual feed.  
明日香僵住了。真嗣透过视觉画面恳求地望着她。

"_Langley. Report to HQ. Now."_  
"兰利。立即向总部报告。现在。"

She panted heavily, her eyes focused on Shinji as she slowly lowered the tree.  
她喘着粗气，目光紧盯着真嗣，缓缓地将树放下。

The Commander's voice sent shivers down her spine. "_I'm very disappointed in you."_  
指挥官的声音让她脊背发凉。“我对你非常失望。”

The tree slipped from her fingers and crashed into the concrete. Unit-01 looked down, "_I'm… I'm sorry-"_  
树从她指间滑落，轰然砸在混凝土上。初号机低头，“我……我很抱歉——”

Unit-02 brushed it's shoulder as she passed him. "Then stay out of my hair next time." She gave the EVA and backwards glance, "Ikari." Asuka broke off into a sprint.  
二号机擦肩而过时，她轻拂了一下肩膀。“下次别再插手我的事。”她回头瞥了一眼 EVA，“碇。”明日香加速跑开了。

"_I just wanted to help you!"_ Shinji stared at her as she slowly became more and more obscure.  
“我只是想帮你！”真嗣盯着她，只见她的身影越来越模糊。

No response. 没有回应。

"_Don't worry about her, Shinji."_ Naoko said reassuringly through the feed, "_She'll come around."_  
"别担心她，真嗣。" 直子在通讯中安慰道，"她会想通的。"

Shinji looked down and sighed.  
真嗣低下头，叹了口气。

He began the long walk back to terminal dogma.  
他开始了返回中央教条区的漫长路程。

Asuka panted heavily as dug in the pedals of the stolen NERV bike, narrowly dodging cars that swerved out of the way. When she reached the entrance of her apartment complex, she leapt off the bike and stomped her way up the stairs.  
明日香喘着粗气，用力踩着偷来的 NERV 自行车踏板，险险避开那些急忙避让的汽车。当她到达公寓楼的入口时，她跳下自行车，气冲冲地走上楼梯。

The first thing the Commander made her do when she returned to Central Dogma was deliver a heartfelt apology to Shinji in front of the entirety of the bridge crew, about how she behaved unprofessionally, how she valued his help, how this sort of tantrum would never happen again.  
当她回到中央教条区时，指挥官让她做的第一件事就是在整个舰桥人员面前，向真嗣真诚道歉，关于她如何不专业地行事，如何珍视他的帮助，以及这种发脾气的情况再也不会发生了。

She felt so embarrassed that she could practically feel her face redden, the reflection of the monitors looked as though her head was swollen and about to burst from the itchy green and gold plug suit, the gold lined collar tightened like a rubber band ready to pop.  
她感到如此尴尬，几乎能感觉到自己的脸颊在发烫，监视器上的倒影看起来就像她的头肿胀得快要被那痒痒的绿金相间的插头服撑爆，金色镶边的领口紧得像一根随时会弹开的橡皮筋。

Shinji looked down at her feet throughout the entire apology, he knew it wasn't genuine. Either that or he was too much of a wimp to look her in the eye. Either way, she could care less.  
真嗣在整个道歉过程中一直低头看着她的脚，他知道那不是真心的。要么就是他太懦弱，不敢直视她的眼睛。无论哪种情况，她都无所谓。

He didn't even respond afterwards, he just hung his head and waited for her to go away.  
之后他甚至没有回应，只是垂下头，等待她离开。

Before anyone else could continue to lecture, Ritsuko whispered something in Naoko's ear, and she was excused. For that, she was grateful.  
在其他人继续训斥之前，律子在直子耳边低语了几句，她便被允许离开。为此，她心存感激。

Asuka slowly walked out at first, but began to run when Misato tried to follow her.  
明日香起初缓缓走出，但当美里试图跟随时，她开始奔跑。

She would be punished for this later. Somehow and in some way, she always was. And she had it coming.  
她之后会为此受到惩罚。不知怎的，总会有那么一天。而她早已预料到。

Naoko was never wrong. 直子从未出过错。

The apartment was empty when she came in, nothing new. Her guardian was still at work after all.  
她进来时，公寓空无一人，这并不新鲜。毕竟她的监护人还在工作。

Asuka couldn't believe she was saying this, but she missed those damn cats.  
明日香简直不敢相信自己会这么说，但她想念那些该死的猫了。

---

She fixed herself a premium dinner as a treat for her near-second Angel kill: Pork stock ramen with tabasco sauce.  
她为自己准备了一顿高级晚餐，作为她即将第二次击败使徒的奖励：加了塔巴斯科辣椒酱的猪肉汤拉面。

And it was her kill. That idiot just got the credit, that's all.  
这是她的猎物。那个白痴只是抢了功劳，仅此而已。

As Asuka squeezed the bottle in the paper bowl, a sharp pain burned into her hands, as though the bottle seared into her flesh. With a hiss, she dropped the bottle into the ramen bowl, which in turn toppled over and spilled hot soup onto her lap.  
当明日香在纸碗中挤压瓶子时，一阵剧痛灼烧着她的双手，仿佛瓶子烙进了她的肉里。她倒吸一口气，将瓶子丢进拉面碗中，碗随即翻倒，滚烫的汤汁溅到了她的腿上。

"Dammit!" Asuka exhaled sharply and let the pain fade away. Not the worst burn she's had by a long shot. She stood up and stared at the mess. Asuka scoffed, "Great. That's great." She stomped her way to the kitchen to grab some paper towels.  
“该死！”明日香猛地呼出一口气，任由疼痛消退。这远不是她经历过的最严重的烫伤。她站起身，盯着这一片狼藉。明日香嗤之以鼻，“真棒。太棒了。”她跺着脚走向厨房去拿些纸巾。

"Are you alright?" A soft voice asked.  
“你还好吗？”一个柔和的声音问道。

She practically leapt in the air she spun to face the front door, despite the fact that she already knew who it was. Of all the things Rei Ayanami forgot after her 'close calls', learning how to knock was an ever constant habit. Asuka used to have a book full of things for her to remember, but after a certain point, just gave up.  
她几乎跳了起来，尽管她已经知道是谁，但还是转身面对着前门。在绫波零经历了一系列'生死关头'后忘记的所有事情中，学会敲门却始终是她改不掉的习惯。明日香曾有一本专门记录她需要记住的事情的书，但到了某个点，她干脆放弃了。

"...What do you want?" Asuka responded.  
“……你想要什么？”明日香回应道。

Rei looked down at the stack of papers she held in her arms. "These are your study guides. Horaki asked me to give them to you." She looked up, as though she recollected something, "And for you to call her back. She was concerned."  
丽低头看着怀里抱着的一叠纸张。“这些是你的学习指南。洞木让我转交给你。”她抬头，似乎想起了什么，“还有，让你给她回个电话。她很担心。”

"Sure. Just-" She gestured to the dining room table, "-Leave it there." Asuka eyed Rei up and down as she gently set the stack of papers down, "I haven't seen you around for a while, what have you been up to?"  
“当然。只是——”她指了指餐厅的桌子，“放在那儿就行。”明日香上下打量着丽，看着她轻轻放下那叠纸，“我有一阵子没见到你了，最近在忙什么？”

Rei considered, "I made a friend."  
丽思索着，“我交了个朋友。”

Asuka looked down and frowned, "The Third Child?"  
明日香低头皱眉，“第三适格者？”

"No, a girl in our class. Her name is Kirishima."  
“不，是我们班的一个女生。她叫雾岛。”

"Oh, cool. Cool." Asuka nodded, "Is she keeping you busy?"  
“哦，不错。不错。”明日香点头道，“她是不是让你很忙？”

"Not really." Rei studied Asuka, who stared at her with a trembled pout. "I shall leave you alone." She turned around.  
"并不完全是。" 丽仔细观察着明日香，她颤抖着噘嘴盯着她。"我会让你一个人待着。" 她转过身去。

"Wait-" Asuka called out, "-You don't have to."  
"等等-" 明日香喊道，"-你不必这样。"

Rei turned back at Asuka. "But…you ordered me to leave you alone."  
丽转回来看着明日香。"但是……你命令我离开你。"

"No." Asuka scratched at the ramen stain on her pants, "I mean, you don't have to do that anymore, if you don't want to."  
“不。”明日香挠了挠裤子上拉面的污渍，“我是说，如果你不想的话，你不必再那样做了。”

Rei stared blankly at her, "I see. You are ordering me to disregard my prior orders?"  
丽面无表情地看着她，“我明白了。你在命令我无视之前的命令吗？”

Asuka nodded, "Yeah." She said, her voice hoarse from all the shouting earlier. Asuka leaned on the table, "Do you wanna-" Asuka cleared her throat, "-Play some video games? I still have Melee." This, she had to remember-  
"明日香点点头，“嗯。”她说，声音因之前的喊叫而沙哑。明日香靠在桌子上，“你想不想——”明日香清了清嗓子，“——玩些电子游戏？我还有《任天堂明星大乱斗》。这个，她得记住——”

"Video games?" Rei tilted her head, "What are video games?"  
“电子游戏？”绫波歪了歪头，“电子游戏是什么？”

She exhaled sharply. "They're uh, they're fun. If you wanna play."  
她猛地呼出一口气。“它们，呃，它们挺有趣的。如果你想玩的话。”

"Are you… ordering me to play video games with you?"  
“你这是……命令我和你一起打游戏吗？”

Asuka's lips pressed tightly together as she fought back the burning sensation in her eyes. "Yeah." She rasped. "That's an order."  
明日香紧抿着嘴唇，强忍着眼中灼热的刺痛感。“嗯。”她沙哑地说道。“这是命令。”

Author's Notes: 作者笔记：

_Thank you so much for reading! This one took more of a while than other's mainly due to all the sub-plots I wanted to introduce. There were much more, but I decided to save them for future chapters or combine them together (For example, Shinji's first day of school and the Trident Trio chatting was suppose to be two scenes, but that's no fun, is it?) But yeah, started this in September now here we are. I'd love to hear more of your thoughts! Stay tuned for Chapter 4: Toust est Perplexe  
非常感谢您的阅读！这篇作品花费了比其他章节更多的时间，主要是因为我想引入许多支线情节。原本还有更多，但我决定将它们留待未来章节或合并在一起（例如，真嗣的开学第一天和三叉戟三人组的闲聊原本是两个场景，但那样不够有趣，对吧？）但无论如何，从九月开始动笔，到现在终于完成。我非常期待听到您的更多想法！敬请期待第四章：困惑的托斯特_

I'd like to give a huge shout out to my beta readers from the Asushin server: YourBlandestNightmare, Doc, Greg242, TheLegend27 and SheriffJonesStone! You guys are the real ones, and you help my ideas get off the air, so I owe ya one.  
我要向来自 Asushin 服务器的我的 beta 读者们大声致谢：YourBlandestNightmare、Doc、Greg242、TheLegend27 和 SheriffJonesStone！你们是真正的英雄，帮助我的想法落地生根，我欠你们一个人情。

Till the next one, stay safe and have a happy new year!  
下次见，保重身体，新年快乐！

### Chapter 4

Ryoji Kaji paced back and forth inside the narrow confines of his humid hotel room. It was so humid in fact, the carpet squished out moisture with each step, which is why he wore sandals.  
加持良治在他的狭小潮湿的酒店房间里来回踱步。事实上，房间的湿度如此之高，以至于每走一步，地毯都会挤出水分，这也是他穿着凉鞋的原因。

If he stayed still, Kaji was convinced that he would slowly sink into the dense carpet and into the rotten floor. After a few steps past the bed, he would turn his back from the balcony and return to the kitchen. The intense heat from the sunrise would cause gurgling coffee to sizzle when it dripped down below to the pot.  
如果他保持静止，Kaji 确信自己会慢慢沉入这厚密的地毯，进而陷入腐朽的地板。走过床几步后，他会背对阳台，返回厨房。日出时分的炽热会让滴落的咖啡发出嘶嘶声，落入壶中。

The sound of brewing oil voiced the crucible inside his stomach, the one that grew since Kaji unexpectedly ran into his informant the night before. His informant waited for him at his safehouse with a hollow pill capsule, two cigarettes and a ragged breath. Inside of the pill was a data chip that only contained two video files, something of no doubt was filmed at a great risk. The quality of the concealed footage was low and took multiple watches to make sense of the distortion.  
胃中仿佛有熔炉在烹煮，发出油煎般的声音，这种感觉自昨晚 Kaji 意外遇到他的线人后便愈发强烈。线人在他的安全屋等他，带着一颗空心胶囊、两支香烟和急促的呼吸。胶囊内藏有一枚数据芯片，仅包含两个视频文件，无疑是在极大风险下拍摄的。隐蔽镜头的画质很低，需要多次观看才能理解其中的扭曲。

Then the shapes took form. The blue blurs began to mould into hair, the many pale white streaks became bodies floating in water.  
随后，形状逐渐显现。蓝色的模糊开始塑造成头发，多条苍白的条纹变成了水中漂浮的身体。

He ran a trembled hand through his loose, dishevelled hair and poured himself a mug of black coffee.  
他颤抖着手穿过自己松散凌乱的头发，给自己倒了一杯黑咖啡。

It was a vat full of human beings. All of whom looked like- no. They were. They were Rei Ayanami. They floated inside an aquarium filled with LCL, their eyes and smiles all wide open but dull as plastic, dismembered limbs floated in the tanks unattended. Like grouped up fish inside a market.  
那是一个装满人的大桶。所有人看起来都像——不，他们就是。他们都是绫波零。他们漂浮在一个装满 LCL 的水族箱里，眼睛和笑容都大大地张开，却像塑料一样呆滞，断肢在无人看管的池中漂浮。就像市场里成群的鱼。

He thought they were dead. That was until some at the edge of the tank began to blink.  
他以为他们已经死了。直到水箱边缘的一些人开始眨眼。

As a child, how many of those things were Asuka's only friend?  
小时候，有多少次那些东西是明日香唯一的朋友？

Kaji puffed away at the steam from his coffee. The first clip cut away afterwards to somewhere else, somewhere darker, down below. It was no longer an aquarium, more of a pile or a pit. You could make out the blue hair among the melting-  
加持一边喝着咖啡，一边吹着热气。第一个片段随后切换到了别处，一个更暗的地方，下方。那里不再是水族馆，更像是一堆或一个坑。你可以看到那融化的蓝色头发——

The phone rang, the sound jolted the sleep deprived Kaji and hot coffee splashed on his wrist, giving him the unexpected wake up call he needed. It wasn't his cell phone, rather the corded one by the bedside. Kaji looked at the time, it was Six fifty-five. He frowned.  
电话铃响了，这声音惊醒了睡眠不足的加持，滚烫的咖啡溅到他的手腕上，给了他一个意想不到的唤醒。这不是他的手机，而是床边的那部有线电话。加持看了看时间，是六点五十五分。他皱起了眉头。

Naoko never calls early. 直子从不早打电话。

Kaji opted to allow the phone call to pass and leaned on the counter.  
加持选择让电话响着，自己则靠在柜台上。

The second video clip… Halfway through It made him stand up, pack his bags and leave for Tokyo-03. He had only stopped driving for this scheduled phone call, near the edge of humanity's last great city. The plan originally was to pull over like it was any other routine check in with the Commander of NERV, a regular exchange of information and assignments.  
第二段视频……看到一半时，他便起身收拾行李，直奔东京-03。他原本只是为了这次预定的电话才停车，地点就在人类最后的大城市边缘。按原计划，他本打算像往常一样靠边停车，与 NERV 的指挥官进行例行的信息和任务交流。

But the more the minutes clicked closer to seven in the morning, the more he began to feel sick, and his feet led him to this derelict respite.  
但随着时间一分一秒逼近清晨七点，他越发感到不适，双脚不由自主地把他带到了这片废弃的避难所。

The second video was the angel attack that took place a month ago, near the end of the new year. Kaji had heard only that Rei Ayanami had survived her injuries despite being in critical condition, but was that even the same one, or a replacement?  
第二段视频记录了一个月前，即新年末尾附近发生的天使袭击事件。加治只听说绫波零虽然身受重伤、情况危急，却奇迹般生还，但那究竟是同一人，还是替身呢？

Something was always off about Ayanami, about all of them, but now it began to make sense.  
绫波，或者说他们所有人，总有些不对劲的地方，但现在这一切开始变得合理起来。

At first he thought it was a trick. It had to have been. Some trick the Old Men wanted to plant in his head to throw him off guard, make him desperate and unwittingly expose himself.  
起初，他以为这是个诡计。必定是。那些老头子想在他脑中植入的某种伎俩，目的是让他措手不及，陷入绝望，从而不自觉地暴露自己。

If this was true, surely it was all happening behind the Commanders back. But how could that be possible? She knew every corner of the Magi, and all its records.  
如果这是真的，那肯定是在指挥官背后进行的。但那怎么可能呢？她对 MAGI 的每一个角落都了如指掌，所有的记录她都清楚。

Warnings that he disregarded years ago furiously blared in his mind with new contexts. Perhaps the charismatic commander he and Misato idolised was not the leader they thought she was after all.  
多年前他忽视的那些警告，此刻以新的语境在他脑海中狂响。或许，他和美里所崇拜的那位魅力十足的指挥官，并非他们所认为的领袖。

He couldn't tell anyone, not even Misato. Especially not Misato.  
他不能告诉任何人，甚至不能告诉美里。尤其是不能告诉美里。

How could he look her in the eye and tell them who they left their little girl with after their youthful attempts to play house became too much for them to handle? There wouldn't be a chance to explain, she would charge in, guns blazing, and he would lose her forever.  
他怎能直视她的眼睛，告诉她他们把小女孩托付给了谁？在他们年轻时尝试过家家却无力承担之后，这一切都无法解释。她会冲进来，火力全开，而他将永远失去她。

Another body in the pile.  
又是一具尸体堆积其中。

The thought stayed with him as he slept, and Kaji found it waiting beside him in the morning.  
这个念头伴随着他入睡，第二天早晨醒来时，加持发现它依旧在身旁等待。

In the video, after EVA Unit-02 had left its feral state at the end of the fight, Asuka was delirious, terrified the moment she heard one particular voice.  
在视频中，EVA 二号机在战斗结束时脱离了野兽状态后，明日香听到某个特定的声音时，陷入了神志不清的恐慌。

Kaji frowned. "You didn't want to go back…"  
加持皱起眉头。"你不想回去……"

How many other things had he and Misato been oblivious to all those years ago? What did they do to her?  
他和美里当年还有多少事情是浑然不觉的？他们对她做了什么？

Receiving this message the night before his meeting can't have been a coincidence. How this conversation would go will tell him everything he had to know about the woman Asuka was left alone with for eight years.  
这条消息在他会面前夜收到，绝非巧合。这场对话的走向将告诉他所有他需要了解的，关于那个与明日香独处八年的女人。

Kaji reached for a rubber band from his pocket and tied his hair into a tail as he collected his mask into a forced smirk. He wouldn't be a spectator in their lives anymore, even if it meant exposing himself, he would find a way to get closer to the truth.  
加持从口袋里摸出一根橡皮筋，将头发束成马尾，同时勉强挤出一个微笑。他不会再只是旁观者，即便这意味着要暴露自己，他也要设法接近真相。

He looked at the clock. Six fifty-eight. Kaji exhaled sharply as he dialled the number into his phone.  
他瞥了一眼时钟。六点五十八分。Kaji 深吸一口气，将号码输入手机。

---

Naoko Akagi scowled as she leaned towards her desk and inspected the dossier that sullied her monitor. She scrolled past all the jargon to get to the photographs themselves, two massive mockeries of everything she had worked towards.  
赤木律子皱着眉头，身体前倾靠近办公桌，仔细检查着屏幕上那份玷污了她工作的档案。她快速滚动过所有专业术语，直达那些照片，两张巨大的讽刺，嘲弄着她为之奋斗的一切。

The conference hosted by the Japan Heavy Chemical Industries was promised to be a public debut for her Evangelions, with controlled concepts showcasing other projects early in development to assist Nerv in their endeavours.  
日本重化学工业株式会社主办的这次会议，本应是她那些 EVA 的公开首秀，同时展示一些处于早期开发阶段的其他项目，以协助 Nerv 的各项努力。

So why was she looking at footage of the completed machines? Tokita's dull, clumsy looking orange and tan giant with exhaust pipes on its back that resembled quills, and Asari's horrendous, mediocre excuse of a mecha.  
那么，她为何在观看这些已完成机器的录像呢？富田那笨拙、橙黄相间的大型机甲，背上的排气管宛如刺猬的刺，还有浅利那糟糕透顶、平庸至极的机甲。

The old men and their lackeys have been growing bold.  
那些老家伙和他们的跟班越来越肆无忌惮了。

This wouldn't do. Not at all.  
这可不行，绝对不行。

Her phone rang. She cleared her throat with a small, excited hum and repostured herself. Naoko waited a few more moments for the phone to ring. "Helloo?"  
她的手机响了。她带着一丝兴奋的轻哼清了清嗓子，调整了一下坐姿。直子又等了几秒钟，电话铃声依旧。“喂？”

A strained voice answered on the other side. _"Good morning, Naoko! How are you?"_  
电话那头传来一个紧张的声音。“早上好，直子！你好吗？”

Naoko frowned, "I'm sorry, who is this?"  
直子皱起眉头，“对不起，您是哪位？”

_"It's me, Kaji-" "是我，加治-"_

"Oh, Ryoji, good morning! So good to finally hear from you." The Commander leaned back into her chair. "How's your trip?"  
"哦，凌司，早上好！终于听到你的消息了，真是太好了。"" 指挥官向后靠在椅背上。""你的旅行怎么样？"

There was silence on the other end of the phone. _"...My trip."_  
电话那头陷入了沉默。""...我的旅行。"

"You're heading back to Tokyo-03 after all these years, remember? You told me last night."  
"你终究还是要回到东京-03，这么多年了，记得吗？你昨晚告诉我的。"

There was another pregnant pause, he vainly attempted to conceal his shallow breathing with a chuckle. _"Right, that's right I did. Sorry, it's been a long night."_  
又是一阵意味深长的沉默，他徒劳地试图用一声轻笑掩盖自己浅浅的呼吸。"对，没错，我是说过。抱歉，昨晚太漫长了。"

Naoko hummed in agreement. "No, no, don't be sorry! It's understandable. Speaking of, I had a look at the intel you sent to me." She clicked her tongue, "It looks like I'm in your debt again, mister."  
直子点头表示理解。"不，不，别道歉！这很正常。对了，我看了你发给我的情报。"她咂了咂舌，"看来我又欠你一个人情了，先生。"

A more confident chuckle from Kaji, _"Which you have no need to repay-"_  
加治更加自信地轻笑道，“你无需偿还——”

"Nonsense! You have absolutely no idea how useful all of this is. I have every intention of extending my gratitude to you." Naoko smiled, "I knew I could count on you."  
“胡说！你完全不知道这一切有多么有用。我非常想向你表达我的感激之情。”直子微笑着说，“我就知道可以依靠你。”

_"Of course."_ Kaji cleared his throat, _"Now, about the intel they were pursuing with the Freedom of Information Act, I mixed in some fake scents to lead them off the trail. The government is preparing new legislation, but you won't have to worry about that for long."_  
“当然。”加治清了清嗓子，“关于他们用《信息自由法》追查的情报，我掺入了一些假线索，让他们偏离了方向。政府正在准备新的立法，但你很快就不用担心这个了。”

"Oh yes, especially if that idea of yours works out. I was going to bring all of the kids and make a whole thing about it. But now, I don't know…"  
"哦，是的，尤其是如果你的计划能成功的话。我原本打算带上所有孩子，搞个大场面。但现在，我不知道……"

_"You want to keep things close to the chest."_ Kaji added.  
"你想把事情藏在心里。" 加持补充道。"

"Exactly! I suppose just Asuka and Misato would do the trick in that case. Good idea."  
"没错！我想在这种情况下，只要明日香和美里就足够了。好主意。"

A sharp exhale from the other line. _"...Speaking of. Regarding that other project, do you want me to handle it?"_  
电话那头传来一声急促的呼气。“……说到这个。关于那个其他项目，你想让我处理吗？”

"Hm…" Naoko spun in her chair and faced the rising sun, unbothered by its glare. "No… no, judging from the information you sent me, you wouldn't be necessary."  
“嗯……”直子在椅子上转了个身，面对着初升的太阳，毫不在意它的刺眼。“不……不，根据你发给我的信息来看，你并不必要。”

_"We'll stick to the scenario then."  
“那我们就按原计划进行吧。”_

She nods, "I'll let you know how it goes." Another pause. Naoko sighed, "Alright, I'll let you go now. Thank you again, Ryoji, have a nice trip-"  
她点头，“我会告诉你进展的。”又是一阵沉默。直子叹了口气，“好吧，不打扰你了。再次感谢你，Ryoji，祝你旅途愉快——”

_"-Naoko."_ Kaji interjected.  
“——直子。”加持插话道。

Her jaw tightened. "Yes?" The Commander said warmly.  
她的下巴紧绷。“什么事？”司令官温和地说。

_"Is there anything I could do to be of assistance?"  
"有什么我能帮忙的吗？"_

Naoko spun back in her chair towards the monitor. "You must really miss the girls, don't you? They miss you."  
直子转回椅子面对着显示器。“你一定很想念那些女孩们，对吧？她们也很想你。”

"_I_-" Kaji let out a sigh, _"-I don't know about that."_  
"我——" 加持叹了口气，"——我不确定。"

"Give it a chance. After all, right now is the youngest you'll ever be." She scrolled towards that degenerate Asari's ghastly machine, the so-called Trident Land Cruiser. "I suppose there is something you could help me with at the conference…"  
"给它一个机会。毕竟，现在是你一生中最年轻的时刻。" 她向那个堕落的阿莎丽人的可怕机器，所谓的三叉戟陆地巡洋舰滚动屏幕。"我想在会议上有些事情你可能帮得上忙……"

_"Yes." "是的。"_

"Well, you remember that package at Sasebo I'm going to need you to pick up in about a month or so? Well my good friend Abe Asari is helping with its delivery, and it happens that his pilots will also help in escorting the package back from the pacific to HQ. Abe can be difficult."  
"嗯，你记得大约一个月后我在佐世保需要你去取的那个包裹吗？我好朋友阿部阿莎丽正在帮忙运送，碰巧他的飞行员也会协助从太平洋护送包裹回总部。阿部可能有点难搞。"

_"Okay, what would you need me to do?"  
"好的，你需要我做什么？"_

Naoko shrugged, "You tell me."  
直子耸了耸肩，“你告诉我吧。”

_"...The pilots will need a liaison in order to dock in a ship that size. And incase of a… surprise, I can be ready to fly to HQ with the package. But I suppose I'd need to be on Asari's good side first before I could do that."  
“……飞行员们需要一个联络员才能停靠那么大的船。万一有什么……意外，我可以带着包裹随时飞往总部。不过我想，我得先赢得阿萨里那边的好感，才能做到这一点。”_

She clapped her hands together, "You read my mind."  
她拍了拍手，“你真是懂我。”

_"And afterwards with the Land Cruiser, will it be staying in Tokyo-03?"  
"之后用陆地巡洋舰，它会留在东京-03 吗？"_

"Hm." The Commander looked to the floor of her office ceiling in thought. "We'll see."  
"嗯。" 指挥官若有所思地看向她办公室的天花板。"我们再看吧。"

"_Understood_. "明白了。"

Silence hung between the two lines. "Well then, I'll see you there, won't I?"  
沉默横亘在两人之间。“那么，我们到时候见，不是吗？”

_"Naoko, I'd never miss a chance to miss seeing your lovely face."_ Kaji replied.  
“直子，我可绝不会错过错过见你美丽容颜的机会。”加持回答道。

The Commander waved her hand dismissively and giggled, which echoed in the dark bowels of her office. "Oh, stop it you."  
司令官不以为意地挥了挥手，咯咯笑了起来，笑声在办公室的幽暗深处回荡。“哦，别这样。”

---

A resounding _crack_ throughout the apartment made Asuka flinch.  
公寓内一声响亮的破裂声让明日香不禁一颤。

Misato must have been parched, the strange older woman made a bee-line to the fridge the moment they entered the apartment, her baggage left by the front door.  
美里一定是渴坏了，这位奇怪的年长女性一进公寓就直奔冰箱，行李箱则被留在了门口。

She lifted the beer can up high and gulped it down in seconds. Once it was empty, Misato belted out a high pitched screech to which Asuka shielded her ears against. "Man, I needed that!" Misato squeezed the can and let it roll out of her hand. Her eyes followed the can as it rolled, and Asuka followed suit.  
她高高举起啤酒罐，几秒钟内就一饮而尽。空罐子一放下，美里便发出一声尖锐的喊叫，明日香赶紧捂住耳朵。“天哪，我太需要这个了！”美里捏扁罐子，任其滚落。她的目光随着罐子滚动，明日香也跟着看去。

The two quietly followed it roll off the narrow table and onto the other side of the tiny apartment.  
两人静静地看着它从狭窄的桌子上滚落，掉到了这间小公寓的另一边。

Asuka opted for the glaring sunset and kept her back turned from Misato, towards the balcony. "...Are you mad?"  
明日香选择了背对夕阳，她的背对着美里，面向阳台。"...你生气了吗？"

"Mad? What would I be mad for?"  
"生气？我为什么要生气？"

"You were yelling." "你刚才在大声喊叫。"

"Oh!" Misato waved her hands in an attempt to reassure the girl, but that only made Asuka scoot back further into the adult sized chair. "No, no, don't worry, I'm not mad. It's just--" She gestured to her second can, "--Its really good beer. I like having one or two after a long day at work. Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you."  
"哦！" Misato 挥动双手试图安抚女孩，但这只让 Asuka 更往后缩进了成人尺寸的椅子里。"不，不，别担心，我没生气。只是——"她指了指她的第二罐啤酒，"——这啤酒真的很好喝。我喜欢在漫长的工作日后喝上一两罐。抱歉，我不是有意吓到你的。"

_Crack_. 咔嚓。

She had the day off back then, didn't she?  
那天她正好休息，对吧？

"Oh." Asuka's feet didn't reach the ground while in this chair, so she kicked in the air. "Can I have one?"  
“哦。”明日香坐在这椅子上脚还够不着地，于是她在空中踢了踢。“我能来一杯吗？”

Misato let out a guffaw, "Not a chance, maybe when you're older." She swished the drink in circles, "It's strong stuff."  
美里放声大笑，“想都别想，等你长大点再说吧。”她摇晃着杯子里的饮料，“这可是烈酒。”

"Okay." Asuka tugged at her sleeves, "Sorry."  
"好的。" 明日香拉了拉袖子，"抱歉。"

She waved her hand, "Ah, it's fine. I used to ask my dad all the time when I was your age."  
她挥了挥手，"啊，没事的。我像你这么大的时候也经常问我爸。"

Asuka didn't respond. 明日香没有回应。

Misato cleared her throat and looked around her apartment. As always, Misato would feel the need to distract a discomforting atmosphere with pointless small talk."You must be really excited to start piloting the EVA, huh?"  
美里清了清嗓子，环顾自己的公寓。一如既往，美里总会觉得需要用无关紧要的闲聊来转移令人不适的气氛。"你一定很兴奋要开始驾驶 EVA 了吧？"

Asuka remembered what Ms. Naoko told her before they left her office. She head rose as she matched Misato's gaze and nodded, "Yes 'mam."  
明日香记得离开办公室前奈津子老师对她说的话。她抬起头，与美里对视并点头，“是的，女士。”

"Lighten up a little, would you? This is a no shop talk zone, missy."  
“放松点，好吗？这里禁止谈论工作，小姐。”

"Whas that mean?" “那是什么意思？”

"That means here you can just call me Misato."  
"在这里你可以直接叫我美里。"

"Oh. Yes 'm- Missy." Asuka looked down. "Yes Misato."  
"哦，是的，美——美里小姐。" 明日香低下头。"是的，美里。"

Misato let out a sigh and scanned the room again "Well, I don't have toys or anything. Do you maybe have some dolls you wanna play with?"  
美里叹了口气，再次环视房间，"嗯，我这里没有玩具什么的。你有没有什么想玩的玩偶？"

Asuka shook her head. 明日香摇了摇头。

Misato reached for her third beer can, "I bet this is probably really weird for you, right? Moving in with strangers, I mean."  
美里伸手去拿第三罐啤酒，“我打赌这对你们来说肯定很奇怪吧，对吧？我是说，搬来和陌生人一起住。”

_Crack_. 咔嚓。

"A little bit…" “有一点……”

"I know what that's like. Well, we really want you to feel at home here. I know It'll take you some time to get used to it but-" Misanto leaned closer to the withdrawn child's side of the table, "-Asuka?" Asuka looked up to see Misato smile at her, "We'd really love to get to know you more. Is it okay if you told me a little about yourself?"  
"我知道那是什么感觉。嗯，我们真的很希望你在这里能感到自在。我知道你需要一些时间来适应，但是——" Misanto 向桌子另一边退缩的孩子靠近了一些，"——明日香？" 明日香抬头看到 Misato 对她微笑，"我们真的很想更多地了解你。你能告诉我一些关于你自己的事吗？"

Asuka tugged at her dresses' long sleeves. Remember what Ms. Naoko said, remember what Ms. Naoko said. "Can you tell me a little about yourself?"  
明日香拉了拉她连衣裙的长袖。记得 Naoko 女士说过的话，记得 Naoko 女士说过的话。"你能告诉我一些关于你自己的事吗？"

"Well… sure!" Misato leaned closer to Asuka, "Just between us…" Her hand covered her mouth as she looked around the apartment. "...I'm twenty one." She whispered. "Don't tell anyone though."  
"嗯…当然可以！" Misato 向明日香靠近了一些，"只有我们俩知道…" 她用手捂住嘴，环顾了一下公寓。"...我二十一岁。"她低声说。"不过别告诉任何人。"

"Okay." Asuka whispered back, a tentative smile began to ignore her lessons.  
"好的。" 明日香低声回应，一丝试探性的微笑开始忽略她的教训。

"Speaking of, how old are you again, young lady?"  
"说到这个，你多大了来着，小姑娘？"

"Six…" "六岁……"

"Wow, really?" Misato frowned. "But…" She stammered in confusion. "But…"  
"哇，真的吗？" 美里皱眉道。"但是…" 她困惑地结巴起来。"但是…"

Asuka frowned too, "But what?"  
明日香也皱起了眉头，"但是什么？"

"But you're so tall!" "但是你这么高！"

Asuka looked down at her chair, she had to climb to reach the top earlier. "I am?"  
明日香低头看着她的椅子，之前她还得爬上去才能坐到顶端。“我是吗？”

"Sure!" A smile crept on the girl's face, then she looked down, "Uh-oh, do I see a smile?" Misato said.  
“当然！”女孩的脸上渐渐浮现出笑容，然后她低下头，“哎呀，我看到笑容了吗？”美里说道。

Asuka shook her head and covered her face, "Nuh-uh."  
明日香摇摇头，捂住了脸，“没有啦。”

"I dunno, I think I do." Misato reached for another can, "So? Do I get to ask a question now?"  
"我不知道，我觉得我懂了。" 美里伸手去拿另一罐啤酒，"那么？我现在可以问个问题了吗？"

_Crack_. 咔嚓。

From Asuka's covered face, her hands splayed open to reveal one single blue eye that locked with Misato's, who in turn held the gaze a few seconds before she looked away. Asuka's eye followed her collar bone. "Whas' that necklace?"  
从明日香遮住脸的双手中，她的手指张开，露出一颗蓝色的眼睛，与美里的目光锁定，美里与之对视了几秒钟后移开了视线。明日香的眼睛顺着她的锁骨看去。"那是什么项链？"

"Hm?" Misato looked down and held the giant plus symbol that dangled around her neck, "This is a cross. Pretty isn't it?"  
"嗯？" 美里低头看着挂在自己脖子上的巨大加号符号，"这是十字架。很漂亮吧？"

"Yeah…" Asuka's hands fell away, "Can I hold it?"  
"是啊……" 明日香的手垂了下来，"我能拿一下吗？"

Misato instinctively covered the necklace and leaned back in her seat. "Oh, no. Sorry, it's fragile."  
美里本能地捂住项链，向后靠在座位上。"哦，不行。抱歉，它很脆弱。"

"Why?" "为什么？"

"Well, it belonged to my father. He gave it to me."  
"嗯，这是我父亲的。他把它给了我。"

"Oh." Asuka looked at the cross and tilted her head, "Did he die?"  
"哦。" 明日香看着十字架，歪了歪头，"他去世了吗？"

"How about you ask me another question, hm?" Misato suggested. "Whatever you want."  
"不如你问我另一个问题，嗯？" 美里提议道。"任何你想知道的。"

"...Anything?" "...任何东西？"

"Sure!" "当然！"

"You won't be mad?" "你不会生气吧？"

"Of course not." She took a sip of her beer-  
"当然不会。" 她喝了一口啤酒——

"Are you gonna be my new mom?"  
"你会成为我的新妈妈吗？"

Misato coughed profusely as the beer went down the wrong way. Again, she thumped her chest and gasped for air. "Sorry."  
美里被啤酒呛得连连咳嗽。她再次捶打胸口，喘着气说："对不起。"

She looked down and didn't respond.  
她低头不语。

"...Are you?" Asuka asked again.  
"...你呢？" 明日香再次问道。

Misato cleared her throat. "Well. That's… tricky. We're your guardians, technically, we don't wanna impose and replace your real mom, y'know?" She hid from Asuka's overbearing gaze.  
美里清了清嗓子。"嗯，这是个……棘手的问题。从技术上讲，我们是你的监护人，但我们不想强加于你，取代你真正的母亲，你知道吗？" 她避开了明日香咄咄逼人的目光。

"Oh…"

"Think of me as your… big sister!" Misato nodded to herself, her speech grew more and uninhibited. "If you think about it, it makes more sense that way."  
"把我当成你的…大姐姐吧！" 美里自顾自地点头，话语愈发无拘无束。"这么想的话，是不是更合理些？"

"Okay. I will." Asuka looked down, her eyes focused on just another familiar carpet. "When is Mr. Kaji coming back?"  
"好的，我会的。" 明日香低头看着另一块熟悉的地毯，目光专注。"加持先生什么时候回来？"

"Pfft, yesterday." "噗，昨天。"

Asuka raised an eyebrow, "But it's today."  
明日香挑了挑眉，“但就是今天啊。”

"No- It's a figure of speech, I'm not sure." She glared at the clock, "Typical of him to mess up getting take out, huh?"  
“不——这是个比喻，我不确定。”她瞪着时钟，“他搞砸外卖真是典型，对吧？”

"He's funny." “他挺有趣的。”

Misato offered a strained smile before she reached for her fourth beer. Neither spoke for a long time, the kitchen's analog clock ticked on as though it accounted for a half time before the next segment of the obligatory small talk.  
美里挤出一个勉强的微笑，随即伸手去拿她的第四罐啤酒。两人长时间沉默不语，厨房里的老式挂钟滴答作响，仿佛在为中场休息计时，准备迎接下一段必不可少的闲聊。

She let out a soft chuckle that Asuka didn't acknowledge. "You know, when I was a kid, I always wanted a little--"  
她轻声笑了出来，但明日香并未回应。“你知道吗，我小时候，一直想要一个——”

The door swung open. Asuka could have sworn she heard Misato whisper under her breath, "Oh, thank god." Back then, but the thought was quickly distracted by--  
"门突然打开了。明日香几乎可以肯定她听到美里在下面低声说了一句“哦，谢天谢地。”但这个念头很快就被——

"Mr. Kaji!" Asuka screeched, her demeanour changed as the tiny child scrambled off the chair and catapulted around his neck.  
“加持先生！”明日香尖叫道，她的举止瞬间变了，小家伙从椅子上爬下来，猛地扑向他的脖子。

Kaji didn't have a chance to get a word out as he wheezed in an attempt to balance the grocery bags in his arms, "Hey, Kiddo!" He groaned. Kaji glanced at Misato and with a mischievous smile, offered her the paper bags, "A little help?"  
加持还没来得及说出一个字，就喘着气试图平衡手中的购物袋，“嘿，小家伙！”他呻吟道。加持瞥了一眼美里，带着一丝调皮的笑容，递给她纸袋，“帮个忙？”

Misato squinted and snatched the bags out of his hands, she felt the damp bottom of the bag, "It's cold, Kaji. Where have you been?"  
美里眯起眼睛，一把夺过袋子，感觉到袋底湿冷，“好冷，加持。你去哪儿了？”

With his free hand Kaji rubbed the back of his head, "I was in the middle of things--"  
空着的那只手，加持揉了揉后脑勺，“我正忙得不可开交——”

"--What's her name?" “——她叫什么名字？”

"Nobody, honest! I was getting something else."  
“真的没人！我是在拿别的东西。”

Unbeknownst to the two, Asuka watched them silently as she hung from Kaji's neck, completely invisible.  
两人浑然不觉，明日香正默默地挂在加持的脖子上，完全隐形地观察着他们。

Kaji lifted the plastic bag for Misato to look at. She peeked inside and raised an eyebrow, a movement which Asuka mimicked "A Gamecube?" Misato said.  
加持举起塑料袋让美里看。她往里瞥了一眼，扬起眉毛，明日香也跟着模仿。“一个 Gamecube？”美里说道。

"Yeah, you know, so while she's playing we don't have to--" Kaji hesitated and motioned for Misato to come closer. He whispered something in her ear that Asuka couldn't make out.  
“是啊，你知道的，这样她玩的时候我们就不用——”加持犹豫了一下，示意美里靠近些。他在她耳边低语了几句，明日香没能听清内容。

Misato nodded enthusiastically at whatever he said. "Oh, good idea!" She looked down at the still hanging child, "Hey Asuka, wanna play video games?" Asuka stared blankly at Misato.  
美里对他说的任何话都热情地点头回应。“哦，好主意！”她低头看着还挂着的孩子，“嘿，明日香，想玩电子游戏吗？”明日香茫然地盯着美里。

"Video games?" “电子游戏？”

"You've never played video games?" Kaji asked. Asuka looked up at him and shook her head.  
“你从没玩过电子游戏吗？”加持问道。明日香抬头看着他，摇了摇头。

Misato removed the strange black cube from its cardboard shell. "Really? Never?"  
美里从纸板壳中取出那个奇怪的黑色立方体。“真的？从来没玩过？”

"Nuh-uh." “没有啦。”

"Well they're really fun!" Misato stumbled to the TV and attempted to connect cables with a playful giggle, "I can't believe it, where have you been living, under a rock?"  
“哎呀，它们真的很有趣！”美里踉跄地走向电视，一边尝试连接线缆一边带着俏皮的笑声说，“我简直不敢相信，你到底住在哪儿，石头底下吗？”

Asuka didn't reply. 明日香没有回答。

Kaji gently set Asuka down, there wasn't a couch in the brand new, tiny two bedroom apartment, only two tatami chairs pushed side by side. "Wait here a minute." Kaji stalked closer towards the TV, where Misato struggled to stand up. He wrapped her arms around her waist.  
加持轻轻地将明日香放下，这个崭新的小两居公寓里没有沙发，只有两张榻榻米椅子并排放着。“在这里等我一下。”加持大步走向电视，那里美里正挣扎着站起来。他环抱住她的腰。

She let out a giggle as Asuka watched from the sidelines. "Kaji…"  
她发出一声轻笑，明日香在一旁看着。“加持……”

"Why so formal?" "为何如此正式？"

"I'm still mad at you, you know."  
"你知道我还在生你的气。"

"I'm here now, aren't I?" Kaji said to Misato, who didn't respond. Instead she continued to set up the console. "Come on, what can I do?"  
"我现在来了，不是吗？" 加持对美里说，她没有回应。相反，她继续设置控制台。"来吧，我能做些什么？"

"You can heat up the food for starters."  
“你可以先热一下食物。”

Kaji chuckled, "Yes mam."  
加持轻笑道：“好的，女士。”

He strolled out to the kitchen, Kaji gave Asuka a wink as he passed and after that, it was as though she were invisible. Or a decoration the young couple proudly hung up on their wall before they went about their night together.  
他漫步走向厨房，加持经过明日香时眨了眨眼，随后她仿佛变得透明，或是那对年轻情侣自豪地挂在墙上的一件装饰品，他们随后便自顾自地共度夜晚。

---

"Come on, Asuka! You gotta fight back!" Misato said as she drunkenly attempted to balance the small child on her lap.  
"快点，明日香！你得反击啊！" 美里醉醺醺地试图在腿上稳住小孩子的平衡。

"I'm trying!" Asuka barked back as Samus dodged Dark Link. A new side of Asuka was brought out by the fighting game, it reminded her of the simulations. "B-but if I stay still, you're gonna hit me!"  
"我在努力！" 明日香回吼道，同时萨姆斯躲避着暗影林克的攻击。这款格斗游戏激发了明日香新的一面，让她想起了模拟训练。"但如果我静止不动，你会打到我的！"

"So?" Misato slurred, "Shometimes when you're in a scrap you just gotta charge in, you gotta get angry! Like this: Argh!"  
"那又怎样？" 美里含糊地说，"有时候在混战中，你就得冲进去，你得发怒！就像这样：啊！"

I began to feel something stir inside of my chest, an ember I forgot was there. "Argh…"  
我开始感觉到胸中有什么在涌动，一个我忘记存在的余烬。“啊……”

Misato hair whipped as she vigorously shook her head, "Come on, you can do better than that! Argh!!"  
Misato 的头发随着她用力摇头而飘扬，“来吧，你可以做得更好！啊！！”

"Argh!!" The ember began to hiss and spark until it travelled through to my fingertips and took control of my hands. Suddenly, Samus overwhelmed Link and took away stock after stock, as well as a stationary Kirby.  
“啊！！”那余烬开始嘶嘶作响，火花四溅，直到它蔓延至我的指尖，控制了我的双手。突然间，Samus 压倒了 Link，夺走了一个又一个生命，还有一只静止不动的 Kirby。

Misato glared at the third player, who was dozed off. "Kaji, you weren't even playing!" She said with a sharp bark.  
美里瞪着第三个玩家，那人正打着瞌睡。“加持，你根本就没在玩！”她厉声说道。

"Yeah Kaji!" I mimicked, "You weren't even playing!"  
“没错，加持！”我模仿道，“你根本就没在玩！”

"Huh?" Kaji rubbed his eyes, "Did I win?"  
“嗯？”加持揉了揉眼睛，“我赢了吗？”

"No--" Misato pointed at the tiny redhead on her lap, "Ash-ka won!"  
"不——" 美里指着她腿上的小红发女孩，"阿什卡赢了！"

"Yeah! I kicked your butt."  
"耶！我把你打败了。"

Kaji fought back a yawn, "Really?" He patted me on the head, "Attagirl."  
加持忍住了一个哈欠，"真的吗？"他拍了拍我的头，"好样的。"

I stared in disbelief as Misato tightly bear hugged and swayed side to side. "Oooh, good job sweetheart!"  
我难以置信地盯着，美里紧紧地熊抱并左右摇晃。“哦，干得好，亲爱的！”

I bounced up and down, "Can we play again?"  
我上下跳跃着，“我们可以再玩一次吗？”

"Sure!" Misato whispered something in Kaji's ear. "Let me just… change this here."  
“当然！”美里在加持耳边低语了几句。“让我先……换个地方。”

The names for Misato and Kaji's characters both changed from '_MIS_' and '_004_' to two greyed out '_CPU's.  
Misato 和 Kaji 的角色名从'MIS'和'004'变成了两个灰色的'CPU'。  
_

I looked up to the two standing adults. "...You're not gonna play?"  
我抬头看向那两位站立的成年人。“……你们不打算玩吗？”

Misato patted her on the head, "Don't worry, we just have to grab something from our room. These guys are way harder to fight than us, if you beat them, we can go for ice cream tomorrow. Sounds good?"  
Misato 拍了拍她的头，“别担心，我们只是需要从房间里拿点东西。这些家伙比我们难对付多了，如果你能打败他们，我们明天就可以去吃冰淇淋。听起来不错吧？”

I really believed them as I smiled fully for the first time in years. "Okay!"  
我真心相信他们，多年来的第一次，我完全露出了笑容。“好！”

I turned my attention to the game as the two adults went through. The AIs were harder to beat, but more engaged and attentive. My vision became more and more narrow as I thought of what I would get in return for my victory. That's when I felt myself transform, fighting didn't feel so scary all of a sudden, just losing.  
当两位成年人通过时，我将注意力转向了游戏。AI 对手更难击败，但它们也更投入和专注。随着我对胜利回报的想象，我的视野变得越来越窄。就在那时，我感到自己发生了变化，战斗突然不再那么可怕，只是害怕失败。

I was so close… 我离成功如此之近……

As the two challengers fell of the stage, the commentator announced my victory:  
当两位挑战者从舞台上跌落，解说员宣布了我的胜利：

**_GAME!  
_**

**_The winner is… Samus! 胜者是……萨姆斯！_**

The other two applauded me as I turned to Misato and Kaji, "I did it! I won the game, I-"  
另外两人为我鼓掌，我转向美里和卡吉，“我做到了！我赢得了比赛，我——”

But they weren't there. Their door was locked, Kaji's red tie hung on the door handle.  
但他们不在那里。门是锁着的，加持的红色领带挂在门把手上。

"...Oh." “……哦。”

### Chapter 5 Alone in the Crystal Part I

In waves, the endless roaring cheers of adoration deafened her ears.  
一波又一波，那无尽的崇拜欢呼声震耳欲聋，让她几乎听不见自己的心跳。

Asuka paced back and forth across the stage, to the end of each seventy-five foot tall curtain. Unit-02 awaited beside her, hidden from the audience. The EVA towered over her like a sentry, its bright red amour's gleam blurred her vision, like a crimson sunrise.  
明日香在舞台上踱来踱去，直到七十英尺高的幕布尽头。二号机静静地守候在她身旁，观众无法窥见。EVA 如岗哨般耸立，其鲜红的装甲光芒模糊了她的视线，宛如一片绯红的黎明。

She couldn't contain herself, Asuka jumped over the right foot of Unit-02, hid in between the two colossal feet, and peeked through the curtains. She attempted to scan each and identify every single face in the massive stadium's audience. They all seemed to be as eager as her, after all, they travelled all this way to meet their new protector, to see her. But there were so many faces that it covered the corner of her eyes and blurred into one shape, their voices melted in the waves and became unanimous in a deaf, aimless pitch.  
她按捺不住，明日香跃过二号机的右脚，躲在两座巨足之间，透过幕布窥视。她试图逐一辨认体育场内庞大观众席上的每一张面孔。他们似乎都和她一样急切，毕竟，他们不远千里而来，只为见一见新的守护者，见一见她。但面孔实在太多，遮蔽了她的视线，模糊成一片，他们的声音在浪潮中交融，汇成一致的无目的的嘈杂。

Misato's head burst through the curtain. "Showtime!"  
美里猛地拉开幕布，"演出时间！"

Asuka let out a yelp and leapt into a combat pose. She glared at Misato with a look of betrayal, while Misato broke into a fit of snickers. "T-that's not funny!"  
明日香惊叫一声，猛地摆出战斗姿势。她用一种背叛的眼神瞪着美里，而美里则忍不住咯咯笑了起来。“那-那不好笑！”

"Sorry, I just couldn't help it."  
“抱歉，我实在忍不住。”

"Well help it next time. I'm trying to get in the zone here."  
“下次请忍住。我正努力进入状态呢。”

"Oh, I see." Misato replied, still just a head wrapped in curtains. They both looked up at Unit-02 "Hey, are you sure you don't want to just use the crane?"  
“哦，我明白了。”美里回答道，依旧只露出一颗头裹在窗帘里。两人都抬头看向二号机，“嘿，你确定不想用起重机吗？”

Asuka groaned, "Just get in here! You're embarrassing me." Misato raised her hands in defeat, she joined her and Unit-02 behind the curtain. "Yes, I'm sure. I've done this a hundred times, look." She pointed to the grooves on each armor plate, from the sabaton to the greaves. "There's steps I can take. It's easy."  
明日香抱怨道：“快进来！你让我很尴尬。”美里举手投降，她跟着她和二号机躲到了窗帘后面。“是的，我确定。我已经做过上百次了，看。”她指向每块装甲板上的凹槽，从鞋甲到护胫。“这里有我可以踩的台阶。很简单。”

Misato let out a displeased groan.  
美里发出了一声不满的呻吟。

"It-"

"-I just don't feel good about this. God, you're just a kid- "  
"-我就是觉得这事不对劲。天啊，你只是个孩子- "

"-So easy a kid can do it."  
"-简单到连孩子都能做。"

"Well, hang on-" "-好吧，等等-"

"And Naoko said I could do it." Asuka looked off in the distance.  
"直子说可以让我试试。" 明日香望向远方。

"She said you could if you wanted to."  
"她说如果你想的话，你可以。"

Asuka shrugged, "Well then, I want to."  
明日香耸耸肩，"那么，我想试试。"

"It's just my job to make sure you're safe, that's all. You don't need to impress anyone." Misato realized Asuka was miles away and sighed. She looked up at what transfixed Asuka, the Commander waved at them from a railing high above the EVA, around Unit-02's waist. Her Chief Scientist stood by her side. Kyoko leaned on the rail and stared at Asuka. Even as an obscure figure up above, she could feel the look of contempt, and the white soulless shine of her lenses.  
"我只是负责确保你的安全，仅此而已。你不需要给任何人留下深刻印象。" 美里意识到明日香的心思早已飘远，叹了口气。她抬头望向吸引明日香目光的地方，指挥官从高处的栏杆上向她们挥手，那栏杆位于 EVA 二号机腰部附近。她的首席科学家站在她身旁。绫波零倚靠在栏杆上，凝视着明日香。尽管在高处只是一个模糊的身影，她仍能感受到那鄙夷的目光，以及她镜片上那无情的白色反光。

Misato gave Asuka's shoulder a reassuring squeeze. "Forget about her, that's not why you're here."  
美里轻轻捏了捏明日香的肩膀以示安慰。"别在意她，你来这里不是为了这个。"

Asuka looked up at Unit-02. "Maybe it'll change things if they see me… you know."  
明日香抬头望向二号机。"也许他们看到我……你知道的，情况会有所改变。"

"Asuka…" "明日香…"

A scratching sound came from the speakers that were attached to the rail. Distorted horns and strings played that turned into a triumphant orchestra. Misato and Asuka looked at each other, "Well, I guess that's your cue."  
从固定在栏杆上的扬声器中传来一阵刮擦声。扭曲的号角和弦乐随之响起，逐渐演变成一支胜利的交响乐。美里和明日香互相对视，“好吧，我想这是你的信号了。”

"No." Asuka shook her head and let out a sharp exhale, "It's my chance."  
“不。”明日香摇了摇头，发出一声短促的叹息，“这是我的机会。”

---

The railings and step-pieces almost felt molded for Asuka's steps as she climbed up with ease, with no mind of the height, she had already scaled to Unit-02's hamstring.  
栏杆和台阶仿佛为明日香的步伐量身定做，她轻松地攀爬着，毫不顾及高度，转眼间已到达二号机的大腿后部。

Naoko's booming voice from the microphone got closer and closer. "_Our star recruit has been hand picked by the brightest minds behind the Marduk institute. Our choice was simply unanimous, we all agreed, we really did, that without question this was new natural born talent. Her future is to protect humanity from any threat that comes our way and guide us, not just to safety, but as a species. To our destiny."_ The crowd cheered.  
直子通过麦克风传来的洪亮声音越来越近。“我们的明星新兵是由马杜克研究所最杰出的头脑亲自挑选的。我们的选择是全票通过的，我们都一致认为，毫无疑问，她是天生的新星。她的未来是保护人类免受任何威胁，并引导我们，不仅是安全，而是作为一个物种，走向我们的命运。”人群欢呼起来。

She climbed until she was on the same eye level as the Commander. Kyoko stood beside Naoko as she stared at her and offered a sentimental smile. "_But she has just one flaw. Just one little flaw ladies and gentlemen."_  
她爬到与指挥官视线平齐的高度。京子站在直子旁边，直视着她，露出了感伤的微笑。“但她有一个小小的缺点。女士们先生们，只有一个缺点。”

Asuka took a deep breath.  
明日香深吸了一口气。

"_She's a little shy."_ A few light hearted chuckles came from the audience. "_So please, kindly give it up for the pilot of EVA Unit-02, Asuka Langley… Soryu!"_  
"她有点害羞。" 观众中传来几声轻松的笑声。"所以请大家，为 EVA 二号机的驾驶员，明日香·兰格雷…惣流献上掌声！"

The curtains pulled aside, the orchestra hit its peak and Asuka watched as the crowd roared at the sight of the uncanny giant. Eventually, this turned to gasps as they pointed out the child that scaled up the waist of Unit-02, "_Don't worry folks, she's a professional!"_  
帷幕拉开，乐队达到高潮，明日香看着人群在见到那不可思议的巨人时爆发出欢呼。最终，当他们注意到攀爬二号机腰部的孩子时，转而发出惊呼，"别担心，各位，她是专业的！"

The conductor of the orchestra below the stage sent the band into a performing frenzy with an intense desire to give earth's champion the debut she deserved. Asuka gave one last look over the sea of people, and felt their joy and praise wash away a lifetime of burdens. She let out a sharp exhale and rested her hand on the nape of Unit-02's neck.  
舞台下的乐队指挥以强烈的愿望将乐队带入表演的狂热中，希望能为地球的冠军献上她应得的首次亮相。明日香最后扫视了一眼人海，感受到他们的喜悦和赞美洗刷了一生的重负。她深吸一口气，将手放在二号机颈后。

Naoko turned to her and lowered the mic, "Keep going!"  
直子转向她，压低了麦克风，“继续前进！”

"Yes mam!" “是的，女士！”

---

A stream of air bubbles obscured Asuka's vision the moment she opened her eyes, and she heard nothing of the crowd outside as her ear's adjusted to the sudden change of pressure. And suddenly, the roar of applause returned like a wave. The faces of the delighted crowd that felt like a single blur began to un-strand itself into individual faces, defined and agreed upon one consensus, clear as day.  
当明日香睁开眼睛的那一刻，一串气泡模糊了她的视线，她听不到外界人群的任何声音，因为她的耳朵正在适应突然的压力变化。突然间，掌声如潮水般涌回。那些原本模糊成一片的欢快人群面孔，开始逐渐清晰，每个人的表情都一致，清晰可见。

They loved her. 他们爱她。

She spun around to see Misato and Naoko's reaction, they beamed at her and waved, and Unit-02 waved back. Even Kaji was there, and he waved too. Asuka grinned and Unit-02 flashed a colossal middle finger at him in return, which earned a laugh from the crowd.  
她转过身来，想看看美里和直子的反应，她们对她微笑着挥手，二号机也挥手回应。甚至连加持也在那里，他也挥了挥手。明日香咧嘴一笑，二号机则向他竖起巨大的中指作为回应，这让围观的人群爆发出一阵笑声。

Kaji chuckled and shook his head. "You got me."  
加持轻笑一声，摇了摇头。"你赢了。"

"Heh." "嘿。"

Unit-02 rested her hands on her hips and a strange feeling inked into her bright mood.  
2 号机将双手叉在腰间，一种异样的感觉悄然侵入了她原本明朗的心情。

Somebody was missing. 有个人不见了。

Unit-02 scanned the backstage as everything zoomed away from her, and then the rest of the stadium. "Where's my… M-" She coughed and LCL rippled out, the word was stuck in the back of her throat like an eyelash, "My…" The crowd stopped cheering, but the triumphant music still played in the background. "Can you… can you help me find my mother?" They all pointed in unison at Unit-02's feet as Mother strode ahead of her, only one footstep away from the EVA crushing her. "Mother! Did you see!? Did you?" Unit-02's hands fell to her side in defeat. "D-did you?" Mother did not give so much as a backwards glance, even though Asuka's voice was connected to the intercom. "Wait, where are you going?" Her strawberry blonde hair floated in the wind. "Mother?"  
二号机扫描了后台，一切从她身边迅速远去，随后是整个体育场。“我的……M-”她咳嗽着，LCL 泛起波纹，那个词像眼睫毛一样卡在喉咙后，“我的……”人群的欢呼声停了下来，但胜利的音乐仍在背景中播放。“你们能……帮我找到我妈妈吗？”他们齐刷刷地指向二号机的脚下，母亲正大步走在她前面，仅一步之遥就要被 EVA 踩到。“妈妈！你看到了吗？你看到了吗？”二号机的手无力地垂下。“你看到了吗？”母亲连回头看一眼都没有，尽管明日香的声音通过扩音器传来。“等等，你要去哪儿？”她那草莓金色的头发在风中飘扬。“妈妈？”

The crowd parted ways for Kyoko to disappear within.  
人群为京子让路，让她消失在其中。

"Mama, come back!" “妈妈，回来！”

Unit-02 ran after her but stumbled backwards as she realized that she had nearly stepped into the crowd.  
二号机追赶着她，但当意识到自己差点踏入人群时，她踉跄后退。

Asuka gasped and stumbled backwards, the crowd scrambled away, some cried out in fear and recoiled, some even hurled curses at her.  
明日香倒吸一口气，踉跄后退，人群慌乱散开，有人惊恐尖叫并退缩，甚至有人对她破口大骂。

"_It's okay everyone!"_ Naoko's voice boomed through the intercom, "_She wouldn't hurt a soul."_  
“大家没事的！”直子的声音通过扩音器响起，“她不会伤害任何人。”

Right, Asuka? 对吧，明日香？

Asuka turned around. "Who said that?" She gulped as she looked down at the crowd, "Can you please move? " The crowd went silent and glared at her, "I need to… just move already!" They stood their ground.  
明日香转过身来。“谁说的？”她咽了口唾沫，低头看着人群，“请你们让一下好吗？”人群陷入沉默，瞪着她，“我需要……快点让开！”他们却纹丝不动。

Do it. You know you want to. They're ants. Just do it.  
做吧。你知道你想这么做。他们不过是蚂蚁。就那么做吧。

Unit-02 stamped its foot and the earth trembled, "Move, move now! Or I'll… I'll…"  
初号机猛踏一脚，大地为之震颤，“快动，现在就动！否则我……我……”

Or what? 否则怎样？

"I'll…" “我……”

What will you do? 你会怎么做？

Another tremor shook the ground, but it wasn't from Unit-02, it came from far away and even brought the EVA off of her balance and flinch. The triumphant music screeched, distorted and then twisted into a loud siren. The stage lights blared into a crimson red.  
又一次震动撼动了地面，但这并非来自二号机，它来自远方，甚至让 EVA 失去了平衡，猛地一颤。胜利的音乐尖锐地扭曲，随后转变成刺耳的警报声。舞台灯光闪烁，变成了一片血红。

"What… what-'' Unit-02 slouched and turned to her Commander for answers. "-What is that?"  
“什…什么-”二号机颓然转身，向指挥官寻求答案。“-那是什么？”

"_It's an Angel, Asuka."_  "那是使徒，明日香。"

"An Angel? But… but-"  
"使徒？但是…但是-"

"-That's impossible!" Misato's voice boomed so loudly it didn't need Naoko's intercom, "Commander, you said they wouldn't arrive for another four years."  
"-这不可能！" 美里声音之大，无需直子的对讲机便响彻四周，"司令，您说过它们还要四年才会到来。"

"_I know, Misato, but it is here now. You know what has to be done."_  
"我知道，美里，但它现在就在这里。你知道该怎么做。"

"You're right… God, you're right." Misato replied. "Asuka. I'm sorry. But it's time."  
"你说得对……天啊，你说得对。" 美里回答道。"明日香。对不起。但时候到了。"

"T-time?" "时-时候？"

The crowd talked in confused murmurs as they all turned behind them, to where the setting sun hid the approaching giant. Unit-02 turned to see a giant monstrous silhouette march towards her. Asuka attempted to peer through the glare to get a better look at the Angel. It was skeletally thin, and swayed with each stumbled step as though it were asleep.  
人群中传来困惑的低语，他们纷纷转身，望向那隐藏在落日余晖中的巨影。二号机转身，只见一个巨大的怪异轮廓正向她逼近。明日香试图透过刺眼的光芒，更清楚地观察那使徒。它骨瘦如柴，每一步都踉跄摇摆，仿佛在梦中游荡。

She gulped, "That's… that's not an EVA, is it?"  
她咽了咽口水，"那……那不是 EVA，对吧？"

"_You have to kill it."_ Naoko's calm tone froze the LCL and made her inhale small shards. "_It's time for you to fulfil your duty."_  
"你必须消灭它。"直子平静的语气让 LCL 仿佛凝固，她吸入了一丝冰冷的碎片。"是时候履行你的职责了。"

"I.. I can't!" Asuka rasped, "I'm not ready."  
“我...我做不到！”明日香嘶哑地说，“我还没准备好。”

The Commander was silent for a moment as the footsteps got closer, "_Are you telling me no? After years of preparation you're going to stop now? Don't you remember? We made a deal."_  
指挥官沉默了一会儿，随着脚步声越来越近，“你是要拒绝我吗？经过这么多年的准备，你现在要停下来？你不记得了吗？我们有过约定。”

The oxygen supply in the tank grew thin as Asuka drew ragged breaths. She turned to Misato who stared at her blankly, "Tell her! Tell her I just want to go home!"  
随着明日香急促的呼吸，氧气罐中的供应变得稀薄。她转向美里，后者茫然地看着她，“告诉她！告诉她我只想回家！”

Misato shook her head, "This is exactly why I left."  
美里摇了摇头，“这就是我离开的原因。”

"What?" "什么？"

She didn't reply. Misato walked off the stage and joined the crowd, they began to blur and become merely a shadow behind the sun, until they were nothing to be seen at all.  
她没有回答。美里走下舞台，融入人群，他们开始模糊，变成太阳背后的一抹阴影，直到完全看不见。

"_Asuka…"_ Naoko said slowly, "_How many people need to walk away from you in order for you to learn?"_  
“明日香……”直子缓缓说道，“要多少人离开你，你才能学会呢？”

The Angel stopped walking.  
天使停下了脚步。

Naoko sighed, "_Well. Alright then. If you don't want to do this then so be it, I'll find somebody else. I suppose I could fly in Rei or Shinji."_  
直子叹了口气，"好吧。那就算了。如果你不想做这件事，那我就找别人。我想我可以叫丽或者真嗣来。"

"No! No, I'll do it." Unit-02 clenched her fists, "I'll kill the Angel."  
"不！不，我会做的。"二号机握紧了拳头，"我会杀死那个天使。"

"_I hope so. I really hope so."_  
"希望如此。我真的希望如此。"

Unit-02 turned backwards, the area was derelict, "...Naoko?" The stage's gigantic red curtains flew in the wind and pushed the seventy-five foot tall EVA forward. "Naoko?"  
二号机转身，那片区域荒废了，""直子？""舞台巨大的红色幕布随风飘扬，推动着七十五英尺高的 EVA 向前。""直子？""

She stared at the Angel, which held its vigil. She walked far to the right to be clear of the crowd, and the Angel did the same. She stopped and so did the Angel. Its skeletal, emaciated figure walked away from the sun, and was hidden by darkness, save for its glowing yellow eyes.  
她凝视着那只天使，它坚守着它的守望。她向右走远，避开人群，天使也做同样的动作。她停下，天使也停下。它那骨瘦如柴的身影从阳光下走开，隐入黑暗，只留下那双发光的黄色眼睛。

Unit-02 clenched her fists. The LCL inside the tank boiled so intensely that her hands melted into the control yokes, "What are you looking at? You think I'm afraid of you?"  
零二号机紧握双拳。驾驶舱内的 LCL 沸腾得如此剧烈，以至于她的双手融入了控制杆，“你在看什么？你以为我会怕你吗？”

The Angel continued to stare.  
使徒继续凝视着。

"Well I'm not! Come on!"  
“我才不怕！来吧！”

Explosive footsteps sprinted towards her like thunder and Unit-02 accepted the challenge. She sprinted endlessly until the Angel finally caught the sunset and was locked in her sights. "You're mine!"  
雷鸣般的脚步声疾驰向她，二号机毫不退缩地迎战。她不停地奔跑，直到天使终于捕捉到夕阳的余晖，映入她的视线。“你是我的！”

Asuka let loose a battle cry and lunged for the Angel.  
明日香发出战斗的呐喊，向天使猛扑过去。

Suddenly, she ricocheted backwards and landed on her feet, dazed. Asuka charged again, only to be stopped by an invisible wall, "An AT Field!?" Unit-02's fist slammed against the shimmering barrier, "Come out and fight me!"  
突然，她被弹回并稳稳落地，有些晕眩。明日香再次冲锋，却被一道无形之墙所阻，“AT 力场！？”二号机的拳头猛击那闪烁的屏障，“出来与我一战！”

The Angel punched the barrier as well, which elicited an annoyed yell from Asuka. She struck the AT Field again and again. Her yells turned into the snarls of the EVA. It's jaw begged to break free from its restraints.  
天使也猛击了屏障，这让明日香发出了一声恼怒的尖叫。她一次又一次地攻击 AT 力场。她的喊声变成了 EVA 的咆哮。它的下巴渴望挣脱束缚。

She resorted to crashing her elbow and hammering down with her fists.  
她转而用肘部猛撞，并用拳头重重砸下。

The Angel matched her ferocity until the two stopped and gasped for air. Unit-02 leaned against the AT Field and caught her breath as she grew dizzy.  
天使与她同样狂暴，直到两者都停下来喘息。二号机倚靠在 AT 力场上，随着头晕目眩，她喘着气恢复呼吸。

Asuka growled at the Angel, "Don't think this means you win…" She gasped and looked back down.  
明日香对着使徒咆哮道：“别以为这就意味着你赢了……”她喘着气，再次低头看去。

"Don't think this means you win." The Angel replied.  
“别以为这就意味着你赢了。”使徒回应道。

Asuka gasped and looked back up, across the AT Field. Sunken yellow eyes stared back at her as a fog began to obscure its silhouette, and became only two blurry fog-lights.  
明日香喘着气，抬头望向 AT 力场的另一端。凹陷的黄色眼睛回望着她，随着雾气开始模糊其轮廓，最终只剩下两个朦胧的雾灯。

Unit-02 tilted her head in confusion, "This can't be me…"  
零二号机歪着头，困惑地说：“这不可能是我……”

The Angel tilted her head, "This can't be me."  
使徒歪着头，喃喃自语：“这不可能是我。”

Asuka stumbled backwards, and so did the Angel. Hesitantly Asuka waved her hand, and her reflection mimicked her, and every hand gesture after that. She yelled in frustration and wiped at the barrier between them, but nothing seemed to clear what was on the other side. Her reflection wiped away the fog too, "Come on...come on!"  
明日香踉跄后退，使徒也跟着后退。明日香犹豫地挥了挥手，她的倒影也模仿着她，每一个手势都如出一辙。她懊恼地大喊，用力擦拭着两者之间的屏障，但似乎什么也清除不了另一边的景象。她的倒影也擦去了雾气，“快点...快点！”

The Angel made its true form clear with one final swipe.  
天使以最后一击显露了其真实形态。

Asuka screamed. The Angel screamed back at Asuka, like a parrot would. Then it stared at her blankly. It was more of flesh than the mechanical EVA, chitinous red and white armour grew over its emaciated body. The Beast's sanguine skull was adorned with a thorned white diadem.  
明日香尖叫起来。天使也对着明日香尖叫，如同鹦鹉学舌一般。随后它茫然地盯着她。它的肉体比机械化的 EVA 更为丰富，瘦弱的身躯上长满了红白相间的甲壳。野兽的猩红头骨上戴着一顶带刺的白色冠冕。

It's jaw was bone white. An exposed, flesh-less jaw. There was no metal that restrained the maw like Unit-02's did. The teeth were few, rocky, jagged and misshapen. The ivory jaw was made of dense overgrown bone and the sinew that held it together. They gnashed and dripped with saliva, ready to lunge with one sudden move.  
它的下巴是苍白的骨头。一个裸露的、无肉的下巴。没有金属像二号机那样束缚着它的嘴。牙齿稀少、粗糙、参差不齐且形状怪异。这象牙般的下巴由密集增生的骨头和连接它们的肌腱构成。它们磨动着，滴着唾液，随时准备在一瞬间扑咬。

But what petrified Asuka the most was the Beast's burning, blank eyes, its gaze was breakable. It's… no, her. Her scorned, bleeding eyes oozed strange molten blood that melted all flesh as it dribbled past and scrunched together in agony..  
但最让明日香惊恐的是那野兽燃烧着、空洞无神的双眼，它的目光仿佛易碎之物。它……不，是她。她那被蔑视、流血的双眼流淌出奇异的熔血，所经之处，血肉尽融，痛苦地纠结在一起。

The Beast stared at her misshapen hands. Her eyes suddenly darted side to side in realization and slowly raised her hands to hide her face. But the eyes still burned through the gaps.  
野兽凝视着自己畸形的手。她的眼睛突然左右闪动，意识到什么，缓缓举起双手遮住脸庞。然而，那双眼依旧透过缝隙燃烧着。

Asuka's vision dimmed, and then looked down and realized Unit-02 had covered her eyes too. Both her and the Beast withdrew their hands.  
明日香的视线渐渐模糊，随后低头发现二号机也遮住了她的眼睛。她和野兽都收回了手。

"That's… that's not me." Asuka stood still. "That isn't the real me."  
"那……那不是我。" 明日香僵立不动。"那不是真正的我。"

The Beast gave no reply, instead she paced back and forth, her eyes transfixed on Unit-02's shrunken, paralyzed form.  
野兽没有回答，而是来回踱步，她的目光紧盯着二号机的萎缩、瘫痪形态。

"G-go away." "走-走开。"

The Beast stopped walking and began to pant. It hunched over with each labored pant until it shrieked and threw a feral strike that cracked the AT Field.  
兽停止了行走，开始喘息。它每喘一口气就弯下腰，直到尖叫一声，猛地一击，击碎了 AT 力场。

Unit-02 began to walk backwards, her hands wrung together as she looked around the void. "Somebody… Somebody help me. Misato?"  
二号机开始后退，她的双手紧握在一起，环顾着虚空。“有人……谁来帮帮我。美里？”

Another punch. And then another.  
又一拳。接着又是一拳。

"M…Mama?" "妈…妈妈？"

The Beast stopped the next punch and poked its head through the hole it had pierced through the AT Field. The Beast panted as she stared intensely at Asuka. Unit-02 took a tentative step forward and locked eyes with her. The beast's molten eyes began to melt together until it had only a single cyclopean gaze, its skin now a midnight blue.  
兽停止了下一拳的攻击，将头探入它穿透 AT 力场形成的洞中。兽喘着粗气，紧紧盯着明日香。二号机小心翼翼地向前迈了一步，与她对视。兽的熔岩般的眼眸开始融合，最终只剩下一道独眼凝视，其皮肤也变成了深邃的午夜蓝。

Massive bat-like wings grew from her back as it shuddered and unfolded.  
一对巨大的蝙蝠状翅膀从她的背部颤抖着展开。

"Naoko?" "直子？"

The Beast threw its head back and screamed. It broke through the AT Field, lunging right at Unit-02. The powerful wings forced them airborne and to the lightless sky in seconds.  
使徒猛地仰头尖啸，突破了 AT 力场，直扑二号机。那对强有力的翅膀瞬间将他们带离地面，冲向无光的天际。

"Naoko! Naoko, help me!" "直子！直子，救救我！"

Its hands wrapped around Unit-02's throat as Asuka's very own throat was pinched into a vice she was flung about inside the entry pod as they flew beyond the boundaries of the earth.  
它的双手紧紧扼住二号机的喉咙，而明日香自己的喉咙仿佛被钳子夹住，她在插入栓内被甩来甩去，随着他们飞越地球的边界。

Nobody was going to come save her.  
没有人会来救她。

"Argh- S-stop-" Asuka attempted to hiss out. The Beast didn't relent and her grip only grew tighter around Asuka's throat and vision began to blur. "Stop it! Stop!" She barely managed to hiss out.  
“啊——停、停下——”明日香试图嘶声喊出。那头野兽并未松懈，它的握力愈发收紧，明日香的视野开始模糊。“停下！停下！”她勉强嘶声喊道。

Asuka watched the singular eyeball of the beast, transfixed by its endless spiral depth, even as her own vision dimmed, it was Asuka's only source of light as they flew higher into the infinite void. A red stage light ever focused on her every move, the burning primordial blood flicked onto Unit-02 melted her armor and into Asuka's own flesh and it bubbled. The Beast let out a strange shrill cackle that washed away the fear that held Asuka.  
明日香凝视着那怪兽的独眼，被其无尽的螺旋深邃所吸引，即便自己的视线逐渐模糊，那眼眸仍是她在无尽虚空中飞升时唯一的光源。一束红色的舞台灯光始终紧随她的每一个动作，原始血液的灼热溅射到二号机上，熔化了她的装甲，渗入明日香自己的血肉，使其沸腾。怪兽发出一声怪异的尖锐笑声，驱散了束缚明日香的恐惧。

It was overtaken by boiling hatred.  
它被沸腾的仇恨所吞噬。

Unit-02 gripped the Beast's wrists, The EVA's new found strength pried the hands free from her throat, "I'll kill you!"  
二号机紧握住怪兽的手腕，EVA 新获得的力量将那双手从她的喉咙上掰开，“我要杀了你！”

Wobbling bolts that held the EVA's muzzle together broke free and allowed for at long last, an unbridled roar.  
固定 EVA 枪口的颤动螺栓终于断裂，长久以来的束缚得以解脱，爆发出无拘无束的咆哮。

The EVA whipped her head back and took a large bite of the Beat's fore-wing. With only one wing desperately flapping, they briefly became suspended in the air, and plummeted down to the earth.  
EVA 猛地向后甩头，一口咬住了 Beast 的前翼。仅剩一只翅膀拼命扑腾，两者短暂悬浮空中，随即急速坠向地面。

The Beast was now a cowardly, wretched thing and could only bat her claws at Unit-02's arm as a flurry of feral strikes were unleashed at her. A unsavory grin grew on Asuka's face as power churned through her veins, unrestrained and infinite as they continued to plummet.  
此刻的 Beast 已变得胆怯而可怜，只能对着 Unit-02 的手臂挥舞爪子，而一连串野性的攻击如狂风骤雨般向她袭来。随着不断下坠，力量在 Asuka 的血管中汹涌澎湃，无拘无束，无穷无尽，她的脸上露出了不怀好意的笑容。

Unit-02 felt the Beast's throat, threw her head back and lunged for one final bite. She snarled as she tried to tear the gurgling tendons. Warm, blue blood flew on her face. The Angel's strikes grew slower and sloppy as life eked out of the body. Asuka reflexively wiped her face as her EVA did the same and leaned back, utterly at peace at the rush of her victory, even as the two free-fell down the sky.  
零二号机感受到野兽的喉咙，猛地仰头，发起最后一击。她咆哮着试图撕裂那咕噜作响的肌腱。温热的蓝色血液溅在她的脸上。随着生命从那躯体中流逝，天使的攻击变得越来越缓慢和凌乱。明日香本能地擦了擦脸，她的 EVA 也做了同样的动作，向后一靠，完全沉浸在胜利的快感中，即使两者正从天空中自由坠落。

Both of them caught fire as they fell deeper into their descent of the void, where strange lights awaited them.  
随着他们坠入虚空的深处，两者都被火焰吞噬，那里有奇异的光芒在等待着他们。

Asuka reached for the EVA's control panel, off to the side of the yokes and flipped on her com-switch. "Pilot Soryu to HQ, anybody copy? If you can hear me, Angel is dead."  
明日香伸手去够 EVA 控制面板，位于操纵杆旁边，打开了通讯开关。“驾驶员惣流呼叫总部，有人能收到吗？如果你们能听到，天使已死。”

The fire that burned around them from their impending fall began to burn away the corruption that layered the Angel's body.  
围绕着他们因即将坠落而燃起的火焰，开始烧去天使身上层层叠叠的腐败。

"I repeat-" “我再说一遍——”

It touched Unit-02's face, which Asuka snatched violently in retaliation. Light gathered around them as the earth awaited them at impact. She inspected the purple gauntlet, and gasped at the sight of lime green streaks. Asuka gasped and let go of the hand, it gently brushed the side of her cheek as it fell limp. "No…no not you." She stared at the lifeless body.  
它触碰了零二号机的脸庞，阿斯卡愤怒地猛然抓住。光芒在他们周围汇聚，大地等待着撞击的到来。她审视着那只紫色的手套，看到其中的石灰绿色条纹时倒吸了一口气。阿斯卡惊呼一声，松开了手，那只手轻轻拂过她的脸颊，随即无力垂落。“不……不，不是你。”她凝视着那具毫无生气的躯体。

Unit-02 looked upon the falling body of Unit-01 and stared at the gaping hole left inside of its neck, where the half-bitten entry plug and its pilot flew out in space. Asuka caught the pilot in her hand, too terrified to look as the rest scattered into embers. She held that hand and pressed it into Unit-01's neck, "What do I do? Oh God, what do I do?"  
零二号机俯视着正在坠落的零一号机，凝视着其颈部留下的巨大空洞，那里曾是半咬着的驾驶舱及其驾驶员被抛向太空的地方。明日香伸手接住了驾驶员，惊恐得不敢直视其余部分化为灰烬的情景。她紧握着那只手，将其按在零一号机的颈部，“我该怎么办？哦，天哪，我该怎么办？”

Her radio feed buzzed as it picked up a signal and the distorted voice was instantly recognizable, "_What did you do!?"_  
她的无线电通讯突然响起，接收到一个信号，那扭曲的声音立刻被认出，“你做了什么？！”

"Naoko!" Asuka's lowering air supply constricted her voice. "I-I didn't know, I didn't know it was him, I swear!"  
“直子！”明日香逐渐减少的氧气使她的声音变得紧绷。“我——我不知道，我不知道那是他，我发誓！”

"_Yes you did! Why else would you have…"_  
"是的，你确实这么做了！不然你为什么会……"

"I wouldn't have! I'd never hurt him-"  
"我不会的！我绝不会伤害他——"

"_Did you just interrupt me!?"_ The Commander spat spat at her through the speakers and made Asuka flinch as though venom flew through the filters.  
"你刚刚打断我了吗！？" 指挥官通过扬声器向她咆哮，让明日香不由自主地缩了一下，仿佛毒液穿过了过滤器。

"I'm sorry!" Asuka cried out.  
"对不起！" 明日香哭喊道。

"_You stupid bitch! Look at what you've done!"_  
"你这个蠢婊子！看看你都干了些什么！"

A change in light hit Asuka's eyes, and thousands of distant screams flooded her ears as she fought the urge to look down, past the clouds. A densely populated city was in sight. Her city. Asuka was the meteorite that would smite Tokyo-03.  
光线一变，明日香的眼睛被照亮，无数遥远的尖叫声涌入她的耳中，她强忍着不去低头看，穿过云层。一座人口密集的城市映入眼帘。她的城市。明日香就是那颗将毁灭东京-03 的陨石。

"Help me! I don't know what to do, please tell me what to do!"  
"救救我！我不知道该怎么办，请告诉我该怎么做！"

"_You did this. You're on your own."_ The line clicked and went silent. Asuka turned the body of EVA Unit-02 to face the sky, and squeezed Unit-01's body tight until she felt its limp head rest in the crook of her neck.  
"这都是你自找的。你自己解决吧。" 电话那头咔嚓一声挂断了，陷入沉默。明日香操控着 EVA 二号机转向天空，紧紧抱住初号机的躯体，直到她感觉到它瘫软的头靠在了自己的颈窝。

But no matter how tight she shut her burning eyes, Asuka's stomach dropped as the screams grew louder before the inescapable impact.  
但无论她如何紧闭那灼热的眼眸，随着尖叫声愈发刺耳，明日香的心还是沉了下去，直到那无可避免的冲击降临。

---
She fell from a great height.  
她从高处坠落。

Asuka landed on her bed and sat up to find herself taken back to reality. When opened her eyes, she was greeted by the severe rays of the morning sun, which even the grey heavy set curtains couldn't shield her from, and a stomach ache.  
明日香落在床上，坐起身来，发现自己被拉回了现实。当她睁开眼睛时，迎接她的是早晨刺眼的阳光，连厚重的灰色窗帘也无法遮挡，还有一阵胃痛。

"What the fuck…" “搞什么鬼……”

She attempted to recollect her strange dream, but the details quickly boiled into vapor from the morning heatwave. It wasn't like any other heatwave. it lacked the familiar humidity. Dry, intense, concentrated, it was as though the sun was accompanied by a magnifying glass, which was aimed directly at Tokyo-03. Asuka groaned and shielded her eyes from the burning sun with her forearm "God, give me a break." The three sputtering fans she banked half her paycheck on did not alleviate the burn of the scorching sun, but it did carry a foreign scent that travelled through her apartment. One that was never present throughout the day.  
她试图回忆那个奇怪的梦，但细节很快就在晨间的热浪中蒸发殆尽。这热浪与众不同，它缺乏熟悉的湿度。干燥、强烈、集中，仿佛太阳旁边有一面放大镜，直直地对准了东京-03。明日香呻吟着，用前臂遮挡着灼热的阳光，“上帝啊，让我喘口气吧。”她用半个月的薪水买来的三台风扇发出嘶嘶声，虽然没能缓解烈日的炙烤，却带来了一股外来的气息，弥漫在她的公寓里。这种气息在白天从未出现过。

Or at night neither, now that she thought about it.  
现在想来，晚上也没有。

Someone was cooking? 有人在做饭吗？

Even as her mind collected itself, Asuka couldn't help but smirk.  
即便思绪逐渐聚拢，明日香还是忍不住扬起了嘴角。

"...Ikari." “……碇。”

Her eyes trailed to the right, She reached for the baseball bat that rested beside her nightstand. "Breaking and entering now, are we?" Asuka tiptoed to the door and slowly slid it open. Someone was in the kitchen, cooking with the lights off. Asuka spun the bat with a flick of the wrist as she stalked the hallway. "This will show you who's boss 'round here, damn kill stealer."  
她的目光向右一瞥，伸手去拿床头柜旁的那根棒球棍。“现在开始破门而入了吗？”明日香踮着脚走到门前，缓缓将门推开。厨房里有人在黑暗中做饭。明日香手腕一抖，棒球棍在空中旋转，她沿着走廊悄悄逼近。“这次就让你见识见识，谁才是这里的老大，该死的抢人头贼。”

Then she realized the person cooking was far too tall to be Shinji, it was a woman. Asuka froze. It was difficult to make out who the stranger was at first, but the sunray which bled through the curtains showed her bob of burgundy hair to be unmistakable.  
随后她意识到，那个在厨房里忙碌的身影实在太高大，不可能是真嗣，而是一位女性。明日香僵住了。起初很难辨认出这位陌生人的身份，但透过窗帘洒进来的阳光照亮了她那不容错认的酒红色短发。

Asuka's hand wobbled, she hid the baseball bat behind her back. "Good- good morning, Naoko-''  
明日香的手颤抖着，她将棒球棒藏在了背后。"早上好，直子——"

Suddenly, a startling _pop_ came from the toaster that made the unknown woman yelp. The burgundy haired woman turned to reach for the toast, her hand still fixing the frying pan on the stove. The crack of sunlight that went through the curtains showed her face.  
突然，烤面包机发出一声惊人的“砰”响，让那位陌生女子惊叫起来。酒红色头发的女子转身去拿吐司，她的另一只手还在调整炉子上的煎锅。透过窗帘裂缝射入的阳光照亮了她的面庞。

It wasn't Naoko, instead it was her guardian. "... Eh!? Akagi?"  
不是直子，而是她的监护人。“……诶！？赤木？”

"Hmm?" Ritsuko looked behind and locked eyes with her. "Oh, good morning Asuka."  
“嗯？”律子回头，与她四目相对。“哦，早上好，明日香。”

Asuka peered at Ritsuko suspiciously "Morning? The fuck you doing here?"  
明日香怀疑地打量着律子：“早上？你在这里搞什么鬼？”

"Mother gave me the day off, and then I have important business to attend to in Old Tokyo." Ritsuko peered behind Asuka's back. "Why do you have a bat?"  
"妈妈今天放我假，然后我得去老东京处理一些重要事务。" 律子在明日香背后窥视。"你为什么带着球棒？"

"Huh?" Asuka glanced at it, then at her, sweat beaded off her brow. "I- I thought you were that pervert Ikari!"  
"啊？" 明日香瞥了一眼球棒，又看向她，额头上渗出汗珠。"我——我以为你是那个变态碇真嗣！"

"Oh, did you?" Ritsuko was for once not in her work attire, but in a blue pajamas. She turned her attention back to the frying pan, "Didn't know he had it in him."  
"哦，是吗？" 律子这次没有穿工作服，而是穿着蓝色睡衣。她转回注意力到煎锅上，"没想到他还有这一面。"

"And I'm a potential political target too, you know!"  
"而且我也可能成为政治攻击的目标，你知道的！"

"Hmm." “嗯。”

"Seriously! It's not funny."  
"说真的！这不好笑。"

Ritsuko gave her a backwards glance, "Am I really that much of a stranger in my own home?"  
律子回头看了她一眼，"我真有那么像个家里的陌生人吗？"

Asuka squinted and pointed the baseball bat at Ritsuko. "You haven't taken a day off in six years. Not even a sick day. You have a bunk in your office, so excuse me if I don't find this suspicious."  
明日香眯起眼睛，将棒球棒指向律子。“你已经连续六年没有休过一天假了，连病假都没有。你的办公室里还有一张床，所以如果我觉得这可疑，请原谅我。”

"Are you hungry? I made breakfast." Ristuko turned and pouted at the dried out pan full of sunny-side eggs. "Or at least… there was an attempt at it." She pointed at the table, which was full of paperwork and bags, "Could you move that?"  
“你饿了吗？我做了早餐。”律子转过身，对着那盘煎得干巴巴的太阳蛋撅起了嘴。“或者说……至少尝试了一下。”她指着堆满文件和袋子的桌子，“你能挪一下吗？”

Asuka wrinkled her nose at the table. There were plastic bags containing actual groceries, instead of yen bills for take out. "What's all this junk?" She nudged them aside with her baseball bat and found folders underneath.  
明日香对着桌子皱了皱鼻子。那里有装着真正食材的塑料袋，而不是外卖的日元钞票。“这些都是什么垃圾？”她用棒球棒把它们推到一边，发现下面还有文件夹。

Ritsuko frowned as she approached the table with two plates, "It's not junk, it's confidential information."  
律子皱着眉头端着两盘东西走近桌子，“这不是垃圾，这是机密信息。”

"What kinda confidential?"  
“什么类型的机密？”

"They're…" Ritsuko cleared her throat, "Some paperwork from your parent-teacher conferences."  
“它们是……”律子清了清嗓子，“你家长会的文件。”

"Oh wow." Asuka scanned the contents of the table, much like Scientist's desk back at the Geofront, it was cluttered, with the promise to be organized when she had time. "A lot to catch up on, huh?" Asuka looked for Ritsuko's reaction, which she didn't return. "Wait, you're serious?"  
"哦，哇。" 明日香扫视着桌上的文件，就像在 Geofront 时科学家的办公桌一样，杂乱无章，承诺有时间再整理。"有很多要赶上的，对吧？" 明日香寻找着律子的反应，但她没有回应。"等等，你是认真的？"

"Someone has to discuss your future- " Asuka snatched one of the folders off of the dining table, labelled 'confidential'. "-H-hey, don't touch that!" Ristuko fumbled as she set the plates down. "Asuka!"  
"总得有人讨论你的未来——" 明日香从餐桌上一把抓起一个标有'机密'的文件夹。"——嘿，别碰那个！" 律子手忙脚乱地放下盘子。"明日香！"

"No one needs to discuss my future, I'm an adult!" Asuka avoided Ritsuko's swipe and dashed to the other side of the table. She opened the folder as she walked with one hand and kept her at bay with the bat in her other hand. Asuka stopped at the sight of its contents. "Wha-" Asuka turned to face Ritsuko and pointed at the image of a clunky orange mecha. It looked like it had quills on its back, or multiple exhausts. "...The fucks this?"  
"没人需要讨论我的未来，我是个成年人！" 明日香躲开律子的抢夺，冲到桌子的另一边。她一边走一边用一只手打开文件夹，另一只手拿着棒球棒挡住律子。明日香在看到文件内容时停了下来。"什——" 明日香转向律子，指着一张笨重的橙色机甲图片。它看起来背上有刺，或者说是多个排气口。"...这他妈是什么？"

Ritsuko reached for the paper and hesitated. "You're not telling anyone about this."  
律子伸手去拿文件，犹豫了一下。“你不会把这事告诉任何人吧。”

Asuka frowned, the playful lines in her face turned downwards as she held the paper, she sank into her chair and set the bat beside the table." Yeah, what's new…"  
明日香皱起眉头，脸上的俏皮线条随着她拿着文件坐下而下垂，她把球棒放在桌旁。“是啊，有什么新鲜的……”

Ritsuko sighed. "It's meant to be a response to the EVA. It's called 'Jet Alone'. It's being outsourced in a private company by the JSSDF-"  
律子叹了口气。“这是针对 EVA 的回应。它叫做‘Jet Alone’。是由 JSSDF 外包给一家私人公司的——”

"-It looks so stupid. I mean, look at it!" Asuka smacked her hand on the paper, "It's got no head! How's the pilot supposed to turn their neck?"  
"- 这看起来太蠢了。我是说，看看它！" 明日香拍打着纸张，"它连头都没有！飞行员怎么转头啊？"

"There is no pilot, it's operated remotely by a computer-"  
"没有飞行员，这是由电脑远程操作的-"

"Eh!?" "诶！？"

"-And you won't think it's so stupid when the Jet Alone's demonstration goes so well today that the UN pulls out our funding in favor of something more affordable. And-"  
"-而等到今天 Jet Alone 的演示进行得如此顺利，以至于联合国撤回对我们的资助，转而支持更经济实惠的项目时，你就不会觉得这主意愚蠢了。而且-"

Asuka chuckled to herself as she studied the dossiers, like she was reading some morning comic strips. "Stupid… little arms, what's it gonna do, headbutt me to death?  
明日香自顾自地轻笑起来，翻阅着档案，仿佛在看早上的连环漫画。"真蠢……小短手，它能干嘛，用头槌把我撞死吗？

Ritsuko sighed again as Asuka flipped through the folder and discovered another Mecha, something resembling a T-Rex, labelled _Project Trident_ "...As you can see, the JSSDF have been developing their own project; it will be presented alongside the same conference." Ritsuko blinked in realisation and hid her face with her palm, "Oh, Mother's going to kill me…"  
看到明日香翻阅文件，又发现了一台类似霸王龙的机甲，标着“三叉戟计划”，律子再次叹了口气，“如你所见，日本自卫队一直在开发自己的项目；它将与同一会议一同展示。”律子突然意识到什么，用手掌遮住脸，“哦，母亲会杀了我的……”

The weight of the folder's contents was light, but a nuisance nonetheless. She looked up at Ritsuko. "We're sabotaging the conference, right? To make them look bad?"  
文件夹里的内容虽轻，却是个不小的麻烦。她抬头看向律子。“我们在破坏会议，对吧？为了让他们的形象受损？”

"And ruin our reputation? No."  
“毁掉我们的声誉？不。”

"Then we're gonna beat them in a fight!" Asuka threw the folder onto the table and sat up, "Show them who they're messing with! Right?"  
“那我们就得在较量中打败他们！”明日香将文件夹扔到桌上，坐直身子，“让他们知道惹到谁了！对吧？”

Ritsuko rubbed the bridge of her nose, "Asuka, no one is sabotaging anything, and no one's fighting anyone. Would you just eat before the eggs get cold? I'd like to have a normal breakfast for once."  
律子揉了揉鼻梁，“明日香，没有人搞破坏，也没有人在打架。你能不能趁鸡蛋还没凉赶紧吃？我只想好好吃顿早餐。”

Asuka eyed it suspiciously as though it were poison. "...Is that real bacon?"  
明日香怀疑地盯着它，仿佛那是毒药。“……这是真培根吗？”

"It's vegetarian." “是素食的。”

Asuka grunted and slumped down onto the table across from Ritsuko, the mound of paperwork divided the two. "Is… she coming too?"  
明日香咕哝一声，瘫坐在律子对面的桌子上，两人之间隔着一堆文件。“她……也会来吗？”

"Who, Mother? Of course not, someone has to look after HQ."  
“谁，母亲？当然不会，总得有人看管总部。”

"Not her…" Asuka nudged at the eggs with her fork. "You know."  
“不是她……”明日香用叉子拨弄着鸡蛋。“你知道的。”

Ritsuko nodded, "Your- Dr. Soryu will be accompanying me and Katsuragi today, yes."  
律子点头道，“你的——碇医生今天会和我以及葛城一起陪同，是的。”

"Today? It's today?" “今天？就是今天吗？”

"I'll be going a few hours after your interview."  
“我会在你的采访结束后几个小时出发。”

The two chewed in silence, save for the occasional crunches from the unsavory bacon. "So? What's the plan then, fearless leader?  
两人默默咀嚼着，除了不时传来的不悦耳培根脆响。“那么？有何计划，无畏的领袖？”

"We're going to secure our investors' goodwill with a demonstration of our own."  
“我们将通过一次展示来巩固投资者的善意。”

Asuka crunched on the dry strip of cardboard. "I'm not dancing."  
明日香咬着那干如纸板的条状物。“我不会跳舞。”

"You don't have to do anything, Shinji will go. Katsuragi will escort him after their parent teacher-interview."  
"你什么都不用做，真嗣会去的。葛城会在他们的家长会面后护送他。"

Asuka looked down at her plate. "...Shinji's going." She repeated.  
明日香低头看着她的盘子。"...真嗣要去。"她重复道。

Ritsuko ignored her as she went back to her hidden note. Asuka's chewing intensified as she exhaled sharply through her nostrils. The relentless, concentrated heat from the sun made the kitchen table too hot to rest their arms on.  
律子无视了她，继续回到她的秘密笔记上。明日香咀嚼的动作加剧，她通过鼻孔猛地呼出一口气。太阳无情而集中的热量使得厨房的桌子热得无法让他们的手臂搁置。

Asuka slammed her hands on the table, "No way!" She shot up, while Ritsuko kept her attention to the paper. "This is the time to debut your elite Evangelion! Not some-" Asuka squeezed her hands around an invisible neck, "-Spaz-piloted shit box!"  
明日香猛地双手拍在桌上，“不可能！”她站起身来，而律子依旧专注于文件。“这是你展示精英福音战士的时候！不是什么——”明日香双手掐住看不见的脖子，“——由笨蛋驾驶的破烂货！”

"Somebody needs to be here to help Rei defend against an Angel attack.  
“得有人在这里帮助绫波抵御使徒攻击。”

Asuka huffed. "Naoko said the window for an attack is starting next week, we're fine, I think they can survive one day without me."  
明日香哼了一声。“直子说攻击窗口下周开始，我们没事的，我觉得他们一天没有我也能撑住。”

"It's not just that." Ritsuko looked up from her notes, "I don't want you going there."  
"不仅仅是那样。" 律子从笔记中抬起头，"我不希望你去那里。"

"So that's what this is about! This is punishment for last time, isn't it?" Asuka stared at her. "Do you know how long I waited for this? When Naoko said the world would be ready to see the first EVA, she said it would be me. Me!"  
"原来如此！这就是上次的事的惩罚，对吧？" 明日香盯着她。"你知道我等这一刻等了多久吗？直子说世界已经准备好迎接第一台 EVA 的亮相，她说那会是我。是我！"

"I don't want you going there, and that's that. It's for your own good." Ritsuko went back to her food and notes, her brow furrowed and dripped with sweat. "What's more important, getting attention, or doing your job?"  
"我不希望你去那里，就这样。这是为你好。" 律子回到她的食物和笔记上，眉头紧锁，额头上渗出汗珠。"更重要的是，是吸引注意力，还是做好你的工作？"

"I can take care of myself. They'll eat that dweeb alive, let me go."  
"我可以照顾自己。他们会让那个书呆子吃尽苦头，让我去吧。"

"This isn't a debate, I'm telling you, Shinji is going, you're staying. And don't even think about telling him, Mother is going to debrief him personally."  
"这不是在讨论，我告诉你，真嗣要去，你留下。而且别想着告诉他，母亲会亲自向他汇报。"

Asuka snorted at Ritsuko, "What, you're the Commander now?"  
明日香对律子嗤之以鼻，"什么，你现在成指挥官了？"

Ritsuko pushed up her reading glasses. "I'm representing NERV along with Captain Katsuragi and Dr. Soryu, so no, I'm not the Commander, but you will follow my lead." She motioned to her handwritten note, "I've been preparing to speak on behalf of Evangelion for some time, but private companies completing their projects so soon was not..." Ritsuko noticed Asuka attempting to peer over her shoulder to read the paper and pivoted away. "...What I expected."  
律子推了推她的阅读眼镜。“我代表 NERV 与葛城上尉和碇博士一同出席，所以不，我不是指挥官，但你们得听从我的指示。”她指了指自己的手写笔记，“我已经为替福音战士发言准备了一段时间，但私人公司这么快完成项目……”律子注意到明日香试图从她肩后偷看纸上的内容，便转了个身。“……并非我所预料。”

"What's that?" "那是什么？"

Ritsuko scooted away from Asuka, who leaned further, "It's nothing-" Asuka snatched the paper out of her hand, "-Asuka! That's private"  
律子从明日香身边挪开，明日香却更加前倾，“没什么——”明日香一把夺过她手中的纸，“——明日香！这是私人的！”

Asuka held the paper up high and read the dissertation in a haughty voice, "Despite the cost efficient convenience of an internal heat engine-"  
明日香高举着纸，用傲慢的语气念道，“尽管内置热引擎在成本效益和便利性上具有优势——”

"-Give it!" "-快给我！"

"-A reactor installed to a ground weapon meant to engage in close quarters combat poses a risk to civilians, blah, blah, blah, deliberate operator malfeasance? Wow. College really didn't do you any favors-"  
"-将反应堆安装在用于近距离作战的地面武器上，对平民构成风险，blah, blah, blah，故意操作员渎职？哇，大学真没给你带来任何好处-"

She dodged a swipe from Ritsuko who chased the speedy pilot.  
她躲开了来自 Ritsuko 的一击，后者紧追着速度飞快的飞行员。

Asuka continued to read as she nimbly avoided her guardian. "-Regardless, the limitations of a five minute timer and the risks of the EVA's aggressive-" Asuka's guardian grabbed her wrists as she fought to keep the paper in place. "-Nature! Are proven time and time again to be countered by their pilots through the connection of science, and the human… heart."  
"明日香继续阅读，灵巧地躲避着她的监护人。“-无论如何，五分钟计时器的限制和 EVA 攻击性的风险-”明日香的监护人抓住了她的手腕，她挣扎着保持纸张不动。“-一再证明可以通过科学与人类……心灵的联系来克服。””

Asuka slowed down. Ritsuko grabbed hold of the paper, to which Asuka pulled, "Hey, I wanna read that!"  
"明日香放慢了速度。律子抓住了那张纸，明日香则拉扯道，“嘿，我想读那个！””

"No, give it back!" "“不，还给我！””

"It was starting to get good!" Asuka barked back-  
“这才刚开始精彩呢！”明日香回呛道——

An audible _rip_ separated the paper and the pair, to which they both stumbled back and stared at their halves.  
纸张被撕开的响声将两人分开，他们各自踉跄后退，盯着手中的一半。

There was an uncomfortable silence, Ritsuko composed herself and cleared her throat. "I can- I can tape it back together."  
一阵尴尬的沉默后，律子整理了一下情绪，清了清嗓子。“我可以用胶带把它粘回去。”

Slowly, Asuka handed her half of the paper, the ink was now smeared by her palms, courtesy of the unforgiving heat. "It wasn't a bad speech…"  
慢慢地，明日香递给她一半的纸张，墨迹已被她手掌的热度晕开。“演讲并不糟糕……”

Ritsuko ignored her as she sat back down on the table. She stared at the paper, Asuka sat down and joined her. After which, the only sounds that came from the apartment were the deafening fans that swiveled back and forth.  
律子无视了她，重新坐回到桌前。她盯着那张纸，明日香也坐下来加入她。随后，公寓里唯一的声音就是那些来回旋转的震耳欲聋的风扇声。

Asuka let out a sniff, "Well, you should've made copies-"  
明日香吸了吸鼻子，“好吧，你应该多复印几份的——”

"Asuka just… eat your breakfast. Please." Ritsuko lit herself a stashed cigarette, she let out a soft sigh of relief as she blew the smoke out her nostrils. Her eyes turned to an unimpressed Asuka. "I haven't had one in a while, okay?"  
"明日香，就...吃你的早餐吧。拜托了。" 律子点燃了一支私藏的香烟，随着鼻孔吐出烟雾，她轻轻地叹了口气，感到一丝解脱。她的目光转向了不以为然的明日香。"我已经有一段时间没抽了，好吗？"

"Did I say anything?" Asuka eyed her warily, she shifted in the seat far too small for the teenager. "Are you still gonna come to the teacher meeting?"  
"我有说什么吗？" 明日香警惕地看着她，她在那张对青少年来说过于狭小的座位上不安地挪动着。"你还会去参加教师会议吗？"

"Of course, it's my job."  
"当然，这是我的职责。"

"Oh, right." Asuka nodded along as she poked at the now luke-warm eggs, "Covers the bills, right?"  
"哦，对。" 明日香一边点头，一边戳着已经温凉的鸡蛋，"能付账单，对吧？"

"Don't be like that. Your well being is important to me." Ritsuko said.  
"别这样。你的幸福对我很重要。" 律子说。

"Right." "对。"

She hesitated. "And… It's important to Misato too. I know what you're going to say, but she wants what's best for you-"  
她犹豫了一下。"而且…这对美里也很重要。我知道你想说什么，但她希望你过得最好——"

"Are you two in cahoots again?" Asuka stabbed the egg and wolfed it down, "Maybe it's better I don't go to that stupid conference."  
“你们俩又串通一气了？” 明日香戳起鸡蛋狼吞虎咽，“也许我最好还是别去那个愚蠢的会议。”

Ritsuko tapped her cigarette into her spare mug, much easier to hide than an ashtray. "I don't doubt you can handle yourself there, We just don't want you in that environment. Other than that, I want you to make your own choices. Who you want to be, what you want to wear." Ritsuko searched for Asuka's eyes, "Where you want to live."  
律子将烟蒂弹进备用马克杯里，这比烟灰缸容易藏得多。“我不怀疑你能在那儿应付自如，我们只是不想让你置身于那种环境。除此之外，我希望你能自己做选择。你想成为什么样的人，你想穿什么。”律子寻找着明日香的目光，“你想住在哪里。”

Asuka looked up at her, after a moment of eye contact, she scoffed, "Are you kidding? Why would I wanna leave?" She gestured to the sunbathed apartment, coated in dust, free of life and its impending reminders. "I love it here."  
明日香抬头看着她，对视片刻后，她嗤之以鼻，“你在开玩笑吗？我为什么要离开？”她指着阳光照耀下的公寓，布满灰尘，空无一物，没有生活的痕迹和即将到来的提醒。“我喜欢这里。”

Gendo rammed the fire exit door open with his shoulder and a labored gargle "_-Outta here."_ He muttered to himself and limped through to the outdoor parking lot. His bathrobe flowed in the wind as he hobbled on his cane. "_Gotta get outta here."_  
源度用肩膀猛地撞开消防门，费力地咕哝着：“离开这儿。”他自言自语，一瘸一拐地穿过门，来到室外的停车场。他的浴袍在风中飘动，他拄着拐杖蹒跚前行。“得离开这儿。”

On the other hand, he firmly held his grey cat Tadeo in place. On one of his fingers dangled a pair of keys.  
另一方面，他紧紧地抱着他的灰猫塔德奥。他的手指上挂着一串钥匙。

He clicked the fob key repeatedly and listened closely for a chime. Gendo bounced on his good leg with anticipation.  
他反复按下车钥匙，仔细聆听是否有铃声响起。源度满怀期待地用他那条好腿跳了起来。

Gendo heard the beep off to the right, it was a dingy scooter with a basket on the front. "_Ha!"_ Hastily, Gendo panted heavily as he hobbled to the scooter and stuck his cane through the basket, followed by Tadeo.  
元渡听到右侧传来的哔哔声，那是一辆破旧的踏板车，前边还挂了个篮子。“哈！”元渡急促地喘着气，一瘸一拐地走向踏板车，将手杖穿过篮子，随后塔德奥也跟了上来。

With a grunt Gendo swiped the helmet off his seat. He fumbled through his robes pocket and pulled out his cracked sunglasses to shield himself from the open scorched skies.  
元渡哼了一声，从座位上抓起头盔。他摸索着长袍口袋，掏出裂了缝的太阳镜，遮挡住头顶焦灼的天空。

The fire exit door was kicked open by two nurses. "Mr. Ikari!" Yuma, one of the nurses called out, "Mr. Ikari! You know you can't be driving that, you can hurt yourself!"  
两名护士踢开了消防门。“碇先生！”其中一位名叫尤马的护士喊道，“碇先生！您知道不能开那辆车，会伤到自己的！”

"_I can handle driving perfectly fine!"_ Gendo spat back. He ignited the scooter into neutral.  
"我开车完全没问题！" 源度反驳道，随即启动了踏板车进入空挡。

Yuma turned to the other nurse, Osamu, a tall lanky man. "Don't just stand there, he's going to hurt somebody!"  
尤马转向另一位护士，高大瘦削的修，"别光站着，他会伤到人的！"

Osama sprinted after him, his long gangly limbs sliced through the air.  
修迈开他那细长的四肢，迅速追了上去，身影在空中划过。

Gendo sped up to avoid the younger nurse, who was in hot pursuit, "_I am your Commander and you will leave me to my business!"_  
源渡加快了速度，以避开紧追不舍的年轻护士，“我是你们的指挥官，你们得让我处理我的事务！”

"Mr. Ikari, you know we can't understand a word you're saying!" Osamu called out, "Come back sir, it's Teriyaki Tuesday!"  
“碇先生，您知道我们听不懂您在说什么！”大佐喊道，“回来吧，先生，今天是照烧星期二！”

"_I hate Teriyaki Tuesday!"_ Gendo stamped on the petal and zoomed down the highway. Gendo's cat glanced back and watched as Osamu rolled his ankle and tumbled down the road.  
“我讨厌照烧星期二！”源渡踩碎了一片花瓣，疾驰在高速公路上。源渡的猫回头望去，只见大佐扭了扭脚踝，摔倒在路面上。

"Call the chief of security!" Osamu cried out, his skin singed by the scorching concrete, "Ikari's loose!"  
“叫保安主管来！”修大声呼喊，皮肤被滚烫的混凝土灼伤，“碇失控了！”

Tadeo clung to the basket for dear life as the true Commander zoomed down the highway, his bathrobe billowed back against the wind, "_I have deeds to perform!"_  
塔德奥紧紧抓住篮子，生死攸关之际，真正的指挥官疾驰在高速公路上，他的浴袍在风中飘扬，"我有任务要完成！"

Nearly every exposed surface since sunrise was too hot to touch, no one dared to even touch the metallic blinds. The students were restricted to pairs and scattered throughout the class, everyone worked through the heat in a unanimous attempt to make their setting immaculate for their impending guests.  
自日出以来，几乎所有暴露在外的表面都热得无法触碰，没有人敢去碰金属百叶窗。学生们被限制成对，分散在教室各处，大家都在一致努力，试图在即将到来的客人面前让他们的环境完美无瑕。

All the students held idle conversation to alleviate from their impending delirium, almost like too many instruments playing at once. However, there was one pitch that Shinji attempted to fine tune out.  
学生们闲聊着，试图缓解即将到来的精神错乱，就像太多乐器同时演奏一样。然而，有一个音调是真嗣试图调谐出去的。

"And-and then there's Aina, Akahana- we call her Hana, we don't really have a nickname for Aina cause 'Ai-Ai' sound weird to me, I dunno why."  
“然后还有爱奈，赤鼻——我们叫她花，我们没有给爱奈起昵称，因为‘爱爱’听起来很奇怪，我不知道为什么。”

"I see." "原来如此。"

Shinji squinted in discomfort as he attempted to find an angle to protect him from sunbeams. Every student in his classroom had tans or sunburns from their walk to school, save for Rei Ayanami. In fact, it seems as though the enigmatic albino was utterly indifferent and absorbed light rather than reflect it.  
真嗣眯起眼睛，试图找到一个角度来躲避阳光。他班上的每个学生都因为上学路上的步行而晒黑或晒伤，除了绫波零。事实上，这位神秘的白化病患者似乎完全无动于衷，她吸收光线而不是反射光线。

Two months of synch tests and visits to the hospital had dulled Shinji until he forgot his motivation, why he came to Tokyo-03 in the first place.  
两个月的同步测试和医院探访让真嗣变得迟钝，直到他忘记了他的动机，他最初来到东京-03 的原因。

He has family, real flesh and blood family in this city. But she is in danger, therefore, he must protect her.  
他在这座城市有家人，真正的血肉至亲。但她身处险境，因此，他必须保护她。

"Then it's me- right there in the middle! After that it's Ena and Morina. My big sister's name is Hana, like Haa-nah. I guess if you can't really hear good it sounds a lot like Maah-naah so we really have to say it clearly or else it gets confusing. "  
“那我就是中间那个！之后是 Ena 和 Morina。我姐姐的名字是 Hana，像 Haa-nah。我想如果你听力不太好，听起来会很像 Maah-naah，所以我们真的得说清楚，不然会搞混的。”

"That is a lot of Na's."  
“那真是好多 Na。”

Every student had their role today in making the classroom immaculate. Rei swept the tiled floor with a broom and as per usual, she held a one sided conversation with Mana Kirishima, who mopped the floors after her.  
今天每个学生都有自己的角色，让教室一尘不染。丽用扫帚清扫着瓷砖地板，一如既往地，她与随后拖地的真奈雾岛进行着单方面的对话。

Mana squinted with one eye as she continued, "I know, right! It's like a family tradition, but you're gonna run out of Na's eventually, so the real question is, how long was the tradition?"  
真奈眯起一只眼继续说道，“我知道，对吧！这就像家族传统，但你总有一天会用完‘奈’的，所以真正的问题是，这个传统有多久了？”

"I do not know." “我不知道。”

"Anyways, it sure sucks that we gotta clean this place spotless on such short notice, I mean, my guardian's not even coming today."  
"总之，这么仓促地要求我们把这里打扫得一尘不染真是糟糕透了，我是说，我的监护人今天甚至都不会来。"

"That is unfortunate." "那确实很不幸。"

Shinji stepped in place as he thought of a potential segway to approach his co-pilot, but there never seemed to be a moment where he could approach Rei at school, and after their daily synch training, they would be driven home separately by Section 2 escorts.  
真嗣一边原地踏步，一边思考着如何自然地接近他的副驾驶，但似乎总找不到在学校里接近绫波的时机，而在每天的同步训练结束后，他们又会被第二分部的护卫分别送回家。

She doesn't own a mobile phone, and it would be far too rude to follow her after dark, he couldn't do that. And with every failed attempt, the more Rei Ayanami's face would take the place of the photo Shinji had in his velcro wallet. But as a consequence, his mother's radiant smile would fade underneath the sky blue hair and vacant gaze.  
她没有手机，而且天黑后跟踪她太过无礼，他做不到。每一次尝试失败，绫波零的脸就会取代真嗣钱包里那张照片的位置。但这样一来，他母亲那灿烂的笑容就在天蓝色的头发和空洞的眼神下逐渐黯淡。

"Well, what about you Rei?"  
“那么，绫波你呢？”

"What about me?" “我怎么了？”

Mana rubbed the back of her head, her mop long forgotten, "Is anyone going to be here for your review today?"  
麻娜揉了揉后脑勺，手中的拖把早已被遗忘，“今天有人会来参加你的审查吗？”

"Possibly. I do not know."  
“可能吧。我不确定。”

Shinji set his broom aside and sighed. If Mana could approach her so nonchalantly, how hard could it be? As opposed to travelling all the way here from Atami to become a pilot and train every day to fight Angels?  
真嗣放下扫帚，叹了口气。既然麻娜能如此轻松地接近她，这又能有多难呢？相比之下，从热海一路来到这里成为一名驾驶员，每天训练与使徒战斗，岂不是更加艰难？

He sighed to himself. "Just say something, you wimp…"  
他暗自叹了口气。“说点什么吧，你这个胆小鬼……”

"What was that?" A voice behind him said. "Who are you calling a wimp?"  
“那是什么？”他身后传来一个声音。“你说谁是胆小鬼？”

Shinji jumped in place and scanned the environment for the voice, before he realized it was the much shorter Keita Asari and remembered to look down. "Oh, hey Keita, I was-"  
真嗣吓了一跳，四处寻找声音的来源，然后才意识到那是比他矮得多的浅利圭太，并记起要低头看。“哦，嘿，浅利，我刚才……”

"-Hey man." "-嘿，伙计。"

"Hey." Shinji chuckled, "Sorry, I was talking to myself. Don't mind me."  
"嘿。" 真嗣笑了笑，"抱歉，我在自言自语。别介意。"

"Oh, sorry." Keita leaned his head to observe the two as well, "Well, we should probably get to work before the Class Rep finds us slacking."  
"哦，抱歉。" 圭太也把头凑过来观察两人，"嗯，我们最好在班长发现我们偷懒之前开始工作。"

"Sorry." Shinji politely raised his hand and scooted away from Keita, "Could you just give me a second? I'll be right back. I was going to-" He hesitated and turned to Rei and Mana.  
"对不起。" 真嗣礼貌地举起手，从圭太身边挪开，"能给我一点时间吗？我马上回来。我本来打算——" 他犹豫了一下，转向绫和玛娜。

"Oh sorry, you're gonna talk to Mana?" Keita said, "What have you got to talk about?"  
"哦，对不起，你要和玛娜说话吗？" 圭太说，"你有什么要说的？"

"N-no not her, I was gonna try to talk to Rei." Shinji nodded and attempt to walk away, "Sorry-"  
"不，不是她，我本来想试着和绫说话。" 真嗣点头并试图走开，"对不起——"

"-Try to?" Keita scratched the back of his head, "Sorry, I thought you and Ayanami were close."  
"-尝试一下？" 圭太挠了挠后脑勺，"抱歉，我以为你和绫波关系很好。"

Shinji gave him a backwards glance, his feet glued to the conversation, "Sorry? What would make you think that?"  
真嗣回头看了他一眼，双脚仿佛被对话粘住，"抱歉？你怎么会这么想？"

"Well you guys are always missing school around the same time. I thought maybe you guys were in a secret club or something."  
"嗯，你们总是差不多时间缺课。我以为你们可能在某个秘密社团里什么的。"

"Right, that. It's a…" Shinji recollected the rehearsed phrase. "...Extracurricular activity."  
"对，那个。这是……" 真嗣回想起事先准备好的说辞。"...课外活动。"

"Oh that's cool, what do you do at this 'extracurricular activity'?"  
"哦，那挺好的，你在这种'课外活动'里都做些什么？"

"Ah-" Shinji lost sight of Rei, he bounced in a suppressed anticipation. "It's an intern sort of class, to become NERV technicians."  
"啊-" 真嗣一时没看到绫波，他压抑着期待跳了起来。"是一种实习课程，为了成为 NERV 的技术人员。"

"Oh, okay." Keita continued moping, his head low, "I dunno why, but I thought you guys were both piloting those robots or something, but nevermind."  
"哦，好吧。" 圭太继续沮丧地低着头，"我不知道为什么，但我以为你们俩都在驾驶那些机器人什么的，不过算了。"

He shook his head absentmindedly, "It's not a rob-" Shinji eyes widened, "No? What?" He spun backwards and faced Keita, "Why would we have that in common?"  
他心不在焉地摇摇头，"这不是机器人——" 真嗣的眼睛睁大了，"不是？什么？" 他转过身面对圭太，"我们怎么会有这个共同点？"

Keita chuckled and shook his head, "Come on man, everyone knows."  
圭太笑了笑，摇摇头，"拜托，老兄，大家都知道。"

Sweat slowly trickled down Shinji's brow, "...I don't know what to tell you, Keita, it's an extracurricular activity."  
汗水缓缓从真嗣的额头上滑落，“……我不知道该怎么跟你说，圭太，这只是个课外活动。”

"Ah, I shouldn't have said anything…' Keita winced and continued to casually mop, "I probably shouldn't have said that, right? Sorry. We'd get in trouble. Anyways, we should probably get back to work-"  
“啊，我真不该说那话……”圭太皱了皱眉，继续若无其事地拖地，“我大概不该那么说，对吧？抱歉。我们可能会惹上麻烦。总之，我们可能该回去工作了——”

"-Wait. Sorry." Shinji blocked his path. He attempted to find his patience as the sun fried his thoughts and fell off his brow. "Not that I have anything to be in trouble for, but I'd like to know what people are saying about me."  
“——等等。抱歉。”真嗣挡住了他的去路。他试图保持耐心，但烈日炙烤着他的思绪，汗水从额头滴落。“不是说我有什么可惹麻烦的，但我确实想知道别人在背后怎么议论我。”

"Well you know, I just heard some things down the grapevine… I don't wanna incriminate you or anything." Keita went back to mopping the floor. "But yeah, I saw that video of that robot fighting the alien thing, the one that looked like a giant weiner, and when apparently the robot talked, it kinda sounded like you were in there; was that you?"  
"嗯，你知道的，我刚从葡萄藤下听到了一些事情……我不想牵连你或什么的。" 圭太继续拖着地板。"不过，我确实看到了那个机器人和外星生物打架的视频，那个外星生物看起来像个大香肠，而且当机器人说话时，听起来有点像你在里面；那是你吗？"

Shinji shushed him loudly and prayed no one overheard, "Who showed you that?"  
真嗣大声地让他安静，祈祷没人听到，"谁给你看的？"

"Aida and Suzuhara." Keita blurted out. "B-but they didn't just come up and show it to me, I swear! I overheard them watching it, that's all.  
"相田和铃原。" 圭太脱口而出。"但他们没有直接来找我展示，我发誓！我只是无意中听到他们在看，仅此而已。"

"Okay..." Shinji nodded slowly, "You just overheard it, that's all?"  
"好吧..." 真嗣缓缓点头，"你只是无意中听到的，就这样？"

"Oh no, yeah. They still showed it to me after."  
"哦不，是的。之后他们还是给我看了。"

They both glanced at a distant Kensuke and Toji, who were bo-staff fighting with their brooms and mops.  
他们俩都瞥了一眼远处的健介和东治，那两人正用扫帚和拖把进行着类似长棍的打斗。

Shinji let out a groan and looked back at Rei and Mana who inched more and more to the far side of the class, by the teacher's desk.  
真嗣发出一声呻吟，回头看向丽和玛娜，她们正一点点挪向教室的远端，靠近老师讲桌的位置。

"Can we please talk about this later? I really, really need to have this conversation with Rei." As Shinji stepped away, he turned back around to see Keita was following him, "...It's a private conversation. Sorry."  
“我们能稍后再谈这个吗？我真的，真的需要和丽谈谈。”真嗣一边走开，一边转身看到圭太跟了上来，“……这是私人谈话。抱歉。”

Keita let out a nervous laugh, and leaned on his mop bucket, "Right, sounds good. I'll just be cleaning here." He nodded at Shinji. "Sorry."  
圭太尴尬地笑了笑，靠在他的拖把桶上，“好的，听起来不错。我就在这儿打扫。”他向真嗣点头示意。“抱歉。”

"Sor-" Shinji gave up and nodded back, "...It's okay."  
"索-" 真嗣放弃了，点头回应，"...没事的。"

The two girls stared out the Teacher's window view of the parking lot. Mana stood on the teacher's wheelie chair to get a better view. "Maybe it's one of the parents?" She asked.  
两个女孩透过教师办公室的窗户望向停车场。麻奈站在老师的转椅上以便看得更清楚。 "也许是某个家长吧？" 她问道。

"I do not know." "我不知道。"

Shinji tentatively joined the two, Rei would often gaze out of the window during lectures but this time she seemed genuinely intrigued at whoever was down there. Her hands were pressed tightly on windows that were too hot to touch.  
真嗣试探性地加入了两人，丽在课堂上常常望向窗外，但这次她似乎真的对楼下的人产生了兴趣。她的双手紧紧按在热得无法触碰的窗户上。

He titled his head. "Hey…what are you guys looking at-"  
他歪了歪头。"嘿…你们在看什么-"

"Be careful, Shinji!" Mana called out, her hands over her brow, "There's a hobo running around the parking lot."  
"小心点，真嗣！" 真奈大声喊道，双手遮在眉间，"停车场里有个流浪汉在跑。"

"A hobo?" "流浪汉？"

Rei didn't acknowledge Shinji, her eyes glued to the stranger.  
丽没有理会真嗣，她的目光紧紧锁定在那个陌生人身上。

"You know, a drunkard or, or a drug addict!" Mana pouted, "He might try to stab you with a needle."  
"你知道的，醉鬼或者吸毒者！玛娜噘嘴道，“他可能会用针扎你。”"

"Oh, I see-" Shinji's eyes lit up as he realized his window for opportunity had opened. "Well…that's not good. Someone should call security."  
"哦，我明白了——" 真嗣的眼睛一亮，意识到机会之窗已经打开。"嗯…那可不太妙。应该有人叫保安来。"

Without hesitation, Mana kicked the wheelie chair towards the teachers desk, "Don't worry, let me do it for you!"  
毫不犹豫地，真奈一脚将轮椅踢向老师的桌子，"别担心，我来帮你解决！"

An odd mix of guilt and giddiness ran through Shinji as his obstacle rolled away. He took a tentative step towards his long lost family member. "Hey Rei…" Rei opened the window's metallic handle, unbothered by the red mark it left on her hand afterwards. "H-have you got a minute?" She put her head through the window to get a better look. "What are you-"  
一种奇怪的愧疚和兴奋感在真嗣心中交织，当他的障碍物滚开时。他小心翼翼地向那位久违的家人迈出一步。"嘿，绫波…" 绫波打开窗户的金属把手，对随后留在手上的红印毫不在意。"你-你有空吗？"她把头探出窗外，以便更好地观察。"你在干什么-"

There was an angry voice that echoed from down below, "That was you who dented my car, wasn't it!_?"_  
从下方传来一个愤怒的声音，回荡着：“是你把我的车撞凹了，对吧！？”

"_Corregh."_ A voice guttered back.  
“科雷格。”一个声音咕哝着回应。

A sandy haired man in a red polo shirt was in a shouting match with the vagrant, who wore a bathrobe and fuzzy slippers. Shinji wiped his eyes to confirm what he saw was delirium, and sadly, he was wrong.  
一个沙色头发、身穿红色 polo 衫的男人正与一个穿着浴袍和毛绒拖鞋的流浪汉激烈争吵。真嗣擦了擦眼睛，确认自己所见并非幻觉，但遗憾的是，他错了。

"How are you gonna pay for that?"  
"你怎么付得起那个？"

"I oo nok haf hime for hissh, I neek hoo finh ma shoh!" Gendo garbled back as he pushed the other man away with his cane.  
"我-我没有时间理会这些，我需要钱来付房租！" 碇源堂含糊地回道，同时用他的手杖将对方推开。

"Your- your what?" "你-你的什么？"

"Ma shon!"" "马松！""

"Son? You're a… parent? What kind of father comes to his son's parent-teacher conference drunk!?"  
"儿子？你是个……家长？什么样的父亲会在儿子的家长会上喝醉！？""

Gendo hobbled towards the school's entrance, "I haf a conhishon!"  
源度蹒跚着走向学校入口，"我有个会议！""

The realization that he just called security on his own father dawned on Shinji. He spunaround to Mana, who was on the line, still standing on the chair.  
意识到自己刚刚叫了保安来对付自己的父亲，真嗣心中一沉。他转身面向玛娜，她还在电话线上，依旧站在椅子上。

"Thank you, sir!" “谢谢您，先生！”

Shinji waved his hands subtly, yet frantically. "Kirishima, hang up the call!"  
真嗣双手微动，却显得十分焦急。“桐生，快挂断电话！”

"Wait, hold on one second." Mana pitched the corded phone between her neck, "What, why? They're on the way."  
"等等，稍等一下。" 玛娜将电话线夹在脖颈间，"什么，为什么？他们已经在路上了。"

Shinji pointed behind him, "That's my-"  
真嗣指了指身后，"那是我的——"

"Shih-hee! Shih-hee!" "诗熙！诗熙！"

He shut his eyes in hope that he would disappear. "...That's my father."  
他闭上眼睛，希望自己能就此消失。“……那是我父亲。”

"Oh." Mama's eyes widened in realisation "Ooh..." She winced. "Whoops."  
“哦。”妈妈的眼神中闪过一丝领悟，“哦……”她皱了皱眉，“哎呀。”

"It's… it's fine." Shinji turned back to the window to find Rei's eyes turned to him, her head still out the window and cooked by the sun.  
“没……没事。”真嗣转回窗户，发现丽的目光已转向他，她的头仍探在窗外，被阳光照得微微泛红。

"He is your father?" Rei asked softly  
"他是你父亲吗？" 丽轻声问道

"Yeah." Shinji offered a nervous smile. "And… To tell you the truth, I-I think he might somehow, in someway be-"  
"嗯。" 真嗣勉强笑了笑。"而且……说实话，我……我觉得他可能在某种程度上，以某种方式……"

"-Who's your father?" Asuka's shrill voice from behind Shinji sent shivers down his spine.  
"——你父亲是谁？" 明日香尖锐的声音从真嗣背后传来，让他脊背发凉。

He turned to see that Asuka stared at him with an extreme intensity. Her face grew red. Shinji cleared his throat, "Hi… Langley-"  
他转头发现明日香正以极其强烈的目光盯着他。她的脸涨得通红。真嗣清了清喉咙，"嗨…兰格雷-"

"-I had a dream I killed you last night."  
"-我昨晚梦到我杀了你。"

"W-what?" "什-什么？"

"What? Nothing. Mind your own business. Who's your father?"  
"什么？没什么。管好你自己的事。你父亲是谁？"

Shinji suddenly realized he was encircled. "W-well-"  
真嗣突然意识到自己被包围了。“呃——那个——”

"-Ikari's father is a hobo." Rei clarified.  
“——碇的父亲是个流浪汉。”绫波澄清道。

Shinji stepped closer to the two, "Guys, he's not homeless, he has a condition-"  
真嗣走近两人，“大家，他不是无家可归，他是有状况——”

"-I knew it!" Asuka shoved Shinji aside and stood next to Rei as they stared out the window to see the altercation. Asuka poked her head through the window, "Oh sweet, it's like watching the nature channel!"  
"我就知道！" 明日香把真嗣推到一边，和绫站在一起，透过窗户看着外面的争执。明日香把头探出窗外，"哦，太棒了，简直像在看自然频道！"

"Shih-hee!" Gendo called from down below, he waved with his cane and pointed at a nearby scooter, "Geh on! We're gehing ough of hiss shihohe!" Gendo stumbled backwards.  
"诗惠！" 源堂在下面对着她喊道，他挥舞着手杖，指向附近的一辆摩托车，"快上车！我们得赶紧离开这个鬼地方！" 源堂踉跄着后退。

Shinji joined Asuka and Rei, he leaned his head out the window, "What are you doing here? You're supposed to be at the hospital!"  
真嗣加入了明日香和绫的行列，他把头伸出窗外，"你在这里做什么？你应该在医院才对！"

Gendo attempted to regain his balance, "Ahm orherin yew!"  
源渡试图恢复平衡，“啊，别挡路！”

More students began to crowd around the window "Move aside, move aside!" Kensuke barked as he worked his way through the growing crowd and pulled out his camera.  
越来越多的学生聚集在窗边，“让开，让开！”剑介一边大声喊着，一边在不断增长的人群中挤出一条路，并掏出了他的相机。

Two security guards ran out the door. The sandy haired man in the polo shirt shook his head. "You're gonna make a fool of yourself, man."  
两名保安冲出门外。那个穿着 polo 衫的沙色头发男子摇了摇头，“你会让自己出丑的，伙计。”

"What's going on here?" One of the security guards asked.  
"这里发生了什么？" 一名保安问道。

The polo man pointed at Gendo, "This drunk dented my car!"  
穿马球衫的人指着源渡，"这个醉鬼撞了我的车！"

"Fugh off!" Gendo shoved the polo man aside and hobbled back on the scooter. Before one of the guards could lunge at the scooter, he had made his escape, "Ruh away Shih-hee!" Gendo's bathrobe flowed in the wind as he fled the scene. "Ruh away!"  
"滚开！" 源渡推开穿马球衫的人，一瘸一拐地回到 scooter 上。在一名保安扑向 scooter 之前，他已经逃之夭夭，"逃吧，四郎！" 源渡的浴袍在风中飘扬，他逃离了现场。"逃吧！"

The classroom was so quiet, you could hear the whir of Kensuke's camera as it zoomed back out.  
教室里静悄悄的，你能听到健介的相机缩回镜头时的嗡嗡声。

Shinji followed the flowing bathrobe until it disappeared beyond the corner of a building, while security guards lazily jogged after his father. The hairs on the back of his neck stood up as he felt the entire classroom have a window's eyed view to his life. The glaring sun felt almost like a stagelight, but that was better than looking his audience in the eye.  
真嗣跟着那件飘动的浴袍，直到它消失在建筑物的拐角处，而保安们懒洋洋地跟在他父亲后面慢跑。他感到教室里的所有人正透过窗户窥视着他的生活，后颈的毛发都竖了起来。刺眼的阳光几乎像舞台灯光一样，但总比直视观众要好。

"Well…" Keita Asari patted him on the back. "At least yours showed up."  
“嗯……”浅利圭太拍了拍他的背。“至少你的出现了。”

---

Gendo panted heavily as he hopped barefoot through empty streets on his cane, the slippers and scooter long abandoned after a traffic pole got in his way. Thankfully, he had managed to catch the cat before the collision. Tadeo bounced in his arm with an annoyed scowl.  
根度喘着粗气，拄着拐杖赤脚跳过空荡的街道，拖鞋和滑板车早在撞上交通杆后就已弃之不顾。幸运的是，他在撞击前设法抓住了那只猫。塔德奥在他怀里不悦地皱着眉头。

When he hobbled through the street of endless cloned skyscrapers, civilians looked out their windows in swaths at him, his presence as unwelcome as an Angel's. This part of the city was meant to be abandoned, derelict, structural fodder to hold the line during Angel attacks.  
当他一瘸一拐地穿过那条无尽复制的高楼街道时，居民们成片地从窗户里望向他，他的出现如同使徒般不受欢迎。这片城区本应被废弃，破败不堪，仅作为结构支撑在使徒攻击时坚守防线。

Why were they all full of people? They must have known that the skyscrapers could not handle Geofront inversion at maximum weight capacity; if there was enough damage to the surface, they'd fall to the depths of the Geofront like brittle icicles.  
为什么它们都住满了人？他们肯定知道这些摩天大楼无法承受最大重量下的地表反转；如果地表受损严重，它们就会像脆弱的冰柱一样坠入地底深处。

His cat looked down, eager to get off the ride.  
他的猫低头望去，急切地想要离开这场游戏。

Gendo skidded into a nearby alleyway. There was a secret passage that went underneath, past the walls of Tokyo-03. He did not know where he would go from there, but anywhere was better than here, he would not give that traitor the satisfaction, even if it meant having to bow to the old men and their will.  
源堂滑进附近的一条小巷。那里有一条秘密通道，穿过东京-03 的城墙下方。他不知道自己将从那里去往何方，但任何地方都比这里好，他绝不会让那个叛徒得逞，即便这意味着不得不向那些老头子们低头，屈服于他们的意志。

He felt the roars of motorcycles off to the distance, they echoed off the empty streets.  
他感受到远处摩托车的轰鸣，回荡在空旷的街道上。

There it was! The secret exit, the caged door with a metal frame. Gendo's hands felt for the false panel, and just like his old blueprints promised, a green touch screen waited for him.  
就在那里！秘密出口，那扇装有金属框架的铁栅门。碇源堂的手摸索着假面板，正如他旧时的蓝图所承诺的那样，一个绿色的触摸屏在等待着他。

"_Ha!"_

The passwords had to be the same. Gendo raised a trembled hand and pointed at the first number. His hand spasmed and hit the wrong button. He growled in frustration and tried again, but his hand shook a second, and third time until he ran out of attempts, the panel turned from green to red.  
密码必须保持一致。碇源堂颤抖的手指向第一个数字。他的手抽搐了一下，按错了按钮。他恼怒地咆哮，再次尝试，但他的手第二次、第三次颤抖，直到他耗尽了尝试次数，屏幕从绿色变成了红色。

Gendo let out an anguished cry and slammed the fence. He took a ragged breath and leaned his head on the fence. He hugged Tadeo tightly to his chest.  
碇源堂发出痛苦的呼喊，猛击栅栏。他急促地呼吸，将头靠在栅栏上。他紧紧地将塔德奥抱在胸前。

"Having some trouble?" "遇到麻烦了吗？"

He turned to the other side of the alley. A helmeted man in an all black suit waited for him. The stranger approached slowly and removed his helmet, to which loose greasy black hair fell down his shoulders. He offered a sincere smile. "Mr. Ikari, I'm the Chief of Security. You probably don't remember me, but I used to work with you at Gehirn-"  
他转向小巷的另一侧，一个身穿全黑西装、头戴头盔的男人在等他。陌生人缓缓走近，摘下头盔，一头松散油腻的黑发垂落肩头。他露出真诚的微笑。“碇先生，我是安全主管。您可能不记得我了，但我曾在 Gehirn 与您共事——”

"_I know who you are, Yamagishi, and I knew your father, mediocre as he may have been."_  
“我知道你是谁，山岸，我也认识你父亲，尽管他可能平庸无奇。”

Yamagishi laughed in confusion, "What? I'm sorry, can you enunciate a little?"  
山岸困惑地笑了，“什么？对不起，你能说清楚一点吗？”

Gendo pushed up his cracked sunglasses and reached for his bathrobe's inner coat pocket as his cane cluttered to the side. "_I have no time for lap dogs. Get out of my way."_  
源度推了推他那副裂了的眼镜，伸手去拿浴袍内侧的口袋，同时他的手杖侧倒在地。“我没时间理会这些小狗。别挡我的路。”

"I didn't understand a word of...look, Sir, let me explain. I got a call from your son, Shinji. He was very concerned when he called us. He actually insisted I come find you myself-"  
“我一个字都没听懂……听着，先生，让我解释一下。我接到你儿子真嗣的电话。他打电话来时非常担心。他坚持要我亲自来找你——”

Gendo drew out a scuffed CZ-75 pistol from his bathrobe and aimed it at Yamagishi, whose earnest smile immediately dropped. Gendo pulled the hammer back.  
源度从他的浴袍中抽出一把磨损的 CZ-75 手枪，对准了山岸，后者诚挚的笑容立刻消失了。源度拉回了击锤。

"Where did you-" Yamagishi slowly raised his hands.. "Mr. Ikari, listen to me, you're not at one-hundred percent-"  
“你从哪——”山岸缓缓举起双手。“碇先生，听我说，你现在状态不佳——”

The gun fired and the bullet, thanks to Gendo's trembled hands, narrowly whirred past Yamagishi's ear. "Okay, maybe you are at one-hundred percent. Please put the gun down, sir. There's civilians nearby, Mr. Ikari- "  
枪响了，子弹由于源度颤抖的手，险险地从山岸的耳边呼啸而过。“好吧，也许你确实状态良好。请放下枪，先生。附近有平民，碇先生——”

"_That's Commander!"_ He pulled the hammer. "_Commander Ikari! I built this city, not her!"_ His arm spasmed.  
"那是指挥官！" 他拉起扳机。"碇司令！这座城市是我建的，不是她！" 他的手臂痉挛着。

"What? Say again?" "什么？再说一遍？"

"_I'm Commander!"_  "我是指挥官！"

"Oh, I see." Yamagishi smiled and pointed at him, "You're the Commander?"  
“哦，我明白了。”山岸微笑着指向他，“你就是指挥官？”

"_Correct!"_  “没错！”

"Are you sure? From what I see there's only one Commander here. And it's not you." Yamagishi's smile twisted into a sneer, "You're just a pathetic old drunk that can't admit he's been beat."  
“你确定吗？据我所见，这里只有一个指挥官。而那不是你。”山岸的笑容变成了嘲讽，“你只是一个可怜的老酒鬼，无法承认自己被打败了。”

_Click. 咔哒。_

Gendo grunted in confusion and shook the pistol. _Click._  
源渡困惑地哼了一声，摇了摇手枪。咔嚓。

Yamagishi broke into a mad sprint, _click._ The only thing Gendo could do in time was toss the hefty handgun, which struck Yamagishi square in his nose. "Son of a bitch!" The chief of security tackled him to the filthy ground. "We're doing this for your own good!"  
山岸突然发疯似地狂奔，咔嚓。源渡唯一能及时做的就是扔出那把沉重的手枪，正中山岸的鼻子。“该死的！”保安队长将他扑倒在肮脏的地面上。“我们这是为你好！”

"_Run, Tadeo!"_ Tadeo wiggled out of Gendo's arm and pawed rapidly at Yamagishi with a garbled growl, to which he got batted away. "_Run!"_  
“快跑，塔德奥！”塔德奥从源渡的臂弯中挣脱，对着山岸疯狂地抓挠，发出含糊的咆哮，随即被拍开。“快跑！”

From the far end of the alley, two Sector 2 agent's half jogged to the scene, their solid black suits weighing them down in the intense heat. One of the taller agents scooped up the cat before it could scurry away, "Got him, sir!" He called out.  
从巷子尽头，两名第二区的特工半跑着赶到现场，他们那身纯黑的制服在酷热中显得格外沉重。其中较高的那位特工赶在猫儿逃走前一把抱起，“抓到它了，长官！”他喊道。

Yamagishi attempted to stop the blood from coming out of his nose as he turned to look at the agent, who gently held the cat despite its ferocity. "What are you- help me hold him down!" One of the agents doubled over, his charcoal suit soaked in sweat. "Took you long enough."  
山岸试图止住鼻血，同时转向那位特工，尽管猫咪凶猛，他仍温柔地抱着它。“你在做什么——帮我按住他！”一名特工弯下腰，他的炭黑色西装已被汗水浸透。“你们来得真够慢的。”

The two agent's in sunglasses looked at each other, then at Gendo as he writhed on the floor, "Sir, he outsmarted us."  
戴着墨镜的两位特工互相对视，又看向在地上挣扎的源堂，“长官，他比我们更聪明。”

"...Just get the car ready and contact the Commander. No, I'm gonna tell her. Just take the gun." Yamagishi looked back at the agent, "L-leave the fucking cat!"  
"...先把车准备好，联系指挥官。不，我来告诉她。你只管拿枪。" 山岸回头看着那名特工，"把那该死的猫留下！"

"Sir!" "长官！"

Yamagishi dabbed his bloody nose. He turned to the other agent, "How did he end up on foot?"  
山岸擦了擦流血的鼻子。他转向另一名特工，"他怎么徒步过来的？"

"He crashed the bike into a telephone pole, sir." The Section 2 agent got a closer look at Gendo as he gently hid Tadeo under his coat. "He's lucky. Not a scratch on him."  
"他把自行车撞到了电线杆上，先生。" 第二部门的特工走近了些，仔细打量着源堂，同时轻轻地将塔德奥藏在自己的外套下。"他很幸运。一点擦伤都没有。"

"Right." Yamagashi let out a laugh. "You hear that, Mr. Ikari?" He raised his fist. "You're lucky!"  
"没错。" 山岸放声大笑。"你听到了吗，碇先生？" 他举起拳头。"你真走运！"

"_Wait! Wait!"_  "等等！等等！"

The punch landed squarely on Gendo's sunglasses, which popped one of the lenses out of its frame and made his head bounce against the pavement.  
一拳正中加持的眼镜，镜片从框架中弹出，他的头随之撞向了地面。

---

Fuyutsuki's leg bounced rapidly inside the classroom desk far too small for adults.  
在成人尺寸显得过于狭小的教室桌内，冬月的腿快速地抖动着。

He shared the room with his subordinates and not at all to his surprise, there were no mothers to be found in this school. All of them were fathers, employees of NERV graciously given the afternoon off on the same day, at the same time to all speak on behalf of their children's future. Said children sat in a neat row outside the class, in the hallway. They had a narrow window view of their parent's sitting in their own seats. Fuyutsuki sat in the further corner of the classroom, by the windows which had a perfect view of a massive tree that stood out in the courtyard. All of its leaves had withered dry, it was no surprise to him if the heat could cause the lonesome tower to catch fire.  
他与下属共处一室，毫不意外地，这所学校里没有一位母亲。所有人都是父亲，NERV 的员工们被慷慨地给予了一个下午的假期，同一时间，为了代表孩子们的未来发言。这些孩子们整齐地坐在教室外的走廊上，透过狭窄的窗户，可以看到他们的父母坐在各自的座位上。冬月坐在教室最远的角落，靠近窗户，那里可以完美地看到庭院中一棵巨大的树。所有的叶子都已枯萎，如果炎热导致那座孤独的塔楼起火，他并不感到惊讶。

He had heard of this annual work holiday and thought nothing of it, but to be here in person-  
他听说过这个年度工作假期，起初并未在意，但亲临现场——

Fuyutsuki suppressed a cough.  
冬月压下了一声咳嗽。

It was certainly something you would only see in Tokyo-03.  
这无疑是只有在东京-03 才能见到的景象。

The cough returned with a vengeance and his lungs seized. Fuyutsuki covered his face in an attempt to get his breathing under control. He hacked again. A few of his fellow employees gave him a side eye, or scooted back into their seats and closer to their conversations.  
咳嗽再次猛烈袭来，他的肺部紧缩。Fuyutsuki 捂住脸，试图控制呼吸。他又猛咳了几声。几位同事斜眼看了他一下，或者挪回座位，更靠近他们的谈话。

A napkin was held in front of his face. "Thank you." Fuyutsuki said in between wheezes.  
一张餐巾纸递到了他面前。“谢谢。”Fuyutsuki 在喘息间说道。

"That's some cough you have there."  
“你这咳嗽可真厉害。”

He wiped his face with the napkin and nodded, "Comes and goes."  
他用纸巾擦了擦脸，点头道：“来去匆匆。”

The man had a familiar face, save for the casual attire. He wore a red polo shirt and a cologne that smells like antiseptic. "I see. Haven't I seen you around work before? In Central?"  
那人面孔熟悉，只是换了便装。他穿着红色 polo 衫，身上散发着类似消毒水的古龙水味。“我明白了。我以前是不是在工作中见过你？在中央区？”

Fuyutsuki nodded, "Most likely, yes-" He motioned his hand in an attempt to recollect, "You're in data analysis."  
冬月点头，“很可能，是的——”他用手势试图回忆，“你在数据分析部门。”

"That's right." His subordinate offered his hand, which the older man shook with a firm grip "Hajime Aida."  
"没错。" 他的下属伸出手，年长的男人以坚定的握力回应，"会津一真。"

"Kozo Fuyutsuki." "藤津耕作。"

"Nice to meet you- oh, Sub-Commander!" Hajime attempted to stand up in the cramped desk, "I should've recognized you."  
"很高兴见到你——哦，副指挥官！" 会津试图在狭窄的办公桌旁站起来，"我应该认出你的。"

"Please- keep your voice down." Fuyutsuki calmly motioned him to sit back down, "You have me mistaken. That title belongs to Dr. Soryu."  
"请——小声点。" 冬月平静地示意他坐回去，"你认错人了。那个头衔属于碇唯博士。"

"Right." Aida nodded, "...Well Fuyutsuki, you seem far too old to be having children."  
"好吧。" 阿井点头，"...话说回来，冬月，你看起来年纪太大了，不该有孩子吧。"

Fuyutsuki responded with a chuckle, "How right you are, I'm merely speaking on one's behalf. They have nobody else, so it is the least I can do."  
冬月笑着回应，"你说得没错，我只是代为转达。他们无人可依，这是我力所能及的事。"

"I see," Aida leaned in closer and motioned to the hallway window, where all the children were lined up in seats. "Which one's yours?"  
"我明白了，" 绫波凑近了些，示意走廊的窗户，那里所有的孩子都坐在座位上排成一行。"哪一个是你的？"

"Ah." Fuyutsuki hesitated. His finger hovered over Shinji for a moment, but passed by him until he reached Rei, who sat on the other side of the rectangular window, "Her."  
"啊。" 冬月犹豫了一下。他的手指在真嗣上方悬停片刻，但掠过他，直到指向坐在长方形窗户另一侧的绫波，"她。"

"That one with the blue hair? Ah, one of the… extra curricular trainees?" Aida asked to which Fuyutsuki hummed in confirmation. "Mine's-" Aida hesitated at the sight of his son, who received an earful from a girl with pigtails.  
"那个蓝头发的？啊，是其中一位……课外训练生吗？" 绫波问道，冬月则哼声表示确认。"我的——" 绫波在看到自己的儿子被一个扎着双马尾的女孩训斥时犹豫了。

"-The one with the camera?" Fuyutsuki said.  
"-那个拿着相机的？" 冬月说。

"...Yeah" Aida sighed, "That's Kensuke."  
"...嗯" 相田叹了口气，"那是真希。"

Silence grew between the two, the increasingly louder conversations amongst the other father's brought them both back to their own days as students in a classroom. Evidently, it didn't take long for the adults to go back in packs and return to their juvenile days.  
两人之间陷入了沉默，其他父亲们越来越响亮的交谈声将他们带回了各自在教室里作为学生的日子。显然，大人们很快便成群结队地回到了他们年少轻狂的时光。

"He looks like you." Fuyutuski offered.  
"他看起来像你。" 冬月提议道。

Aida chuckled. "Maybe a little too much."  
艾达轻笑。"也许有点太像了。"

"That's never a bad thing. It's better he learns from you than somebody else."  
"那绝不是坏事。他跟你学总比跟别人学好。"

"I know, but-" Aida rubbed his stubbled chin, "I'm not worried about the things he isn't learning, it's what I don't want him to pick up from me."  
"我知道，但是——" 艾达摩挲着他那胡茬密布的下巴，"我并不担心他学不到的东西，而是我不希望他从我这里学到的东西。"

Fuyutsuki hummed softly. "I suppose some things just aren't in our control."  
冬月轻声哼道。"我想有些事情确实是我们无法掌控的。"

"Maybe. To be honest, I figured that you were that quiet boy's grandfather, the way he greeted you. Ah-" Aida snapped his fingers, "What was his name? He's a friend of my kid's."  
"或许吧。老实说，我还以为你是那个安静男孩的祖父呢，他那样向你打招呼。啊——" 艾达打了个响指，"他叫什么名字来着？他是我们家孩子的朋友。"

"Young Ikari. " "年轻的碇君。"

"That's it." "就是这样。"

Shinji snuck glances at Rei, who was at the opposite end of the hall. The harsh sunlight fooled Fuyutsuki for a moment. For the slightest moment, their faces shifted to that of their parents- as though Gendo Rokubungi and Yui Ikari never left Professor Fuyutsuki's lecture hall.  
真嗣偷偷瞥向走廊另一端的绫波。刺眼的阳光让冬月一时恍惚。有那么一瞬间，他们的面容仿佛变成了他们父母的模样——仿佛碇源堂和碇唯从未离开过冬月教授的讲堂。

"I am… familiar with his family. He's a bright young man, troubled but… bright. He takes after his parents.''  
"我对他的家庭颇为熟悉。他是个聪明的年轻人，虽有困扰，但确实很聪明。他继承了父母的优点。"

"Hopefully more than his mother than anything. That father of his is one real piece of work." Aida replied.  
"希望他更多地继承他母亲而不是其他。他那位父亲，真是个难缠的角色。" 艾达回应道。"

"He certainly is-" Fuyutsuki turned to Aida, "-You worked with Gendo Ikari in the past, in Gehirn?"  
"确实如此——" 冬月转向艾达，"——你过去和碇源堂在 GEHIRN 共事过，对吧？"

"No? He was at the parking lot half an hour ago, you just missed him."  
"没有吗？他半小时前还在停车场，你刚好错过了他。"

Fuyutsuki frowned, "You're mistaken."  
冬月皱眉，"你搞错了。"

"Pretty hard guy to be mistaken with. He had a big beard, orange sunglasses? Absolutely drunk out of his mind. He dented my car, assaulted me, made a fool out of his kid. And, well-" Aida shrugged, "-Frankly, I couldn't understand a word the son of a bitch said."  
"很难认错的人。他留着大胡子，戴着橙色太阳镜？完全醉得不省人事。他撞坏了我的车，袭击了我，还让他的孩子出丑。而且，嗯——"阿伊达耸耸肩，"老实说，我一句那混蛋的话都听不懂。"

A sinking feeling sweated down Fuyutsuki's spine. "He doesn't have a tongue."  
一种沉重的预感沿着冬月脊背渗下。“他没有舌头。”

"That would explain it." “那就能解释了。”

The ambient conversations that encircled Fuyutsuki began to dull, "...That's impossible."  
环绕着冬月的嘈杂对话开始变得模糊，“……那不可能。”

"I suppose it's pretty uncommon."  
"我想这相当罕见。"

"No. Ikari hasn't left his home in ten years. Nothing would make him want to leave." The intense heat nearly compelled Fuyutsuki to flee the school, as though he was being flushed out by _her_.  
"不。碇已经十年没离开过家了。没有什么能让他想离开。" 酷热几乎迫使冬月逃离学校，仿佛他被她逼得无处可藏。

"Not even his son?" Aida offered.  
"连他儿子也不行吗？" 绫波问道。

Fuyutsuki slowly shook his head.  
冬月缓缓地摇了摇头。

"Now that I think of it, he sounded… scared." Aida rubbed his stubbled chin in thought. "I guess it scared him enough to get out of bed, that's it."  
“现在想来，他的声音听起来……害怕了。”Aida 摩挲着他那胡茬密布的下巴沉思道，“我想这足以吓得他从床上爬起来，就是这样。”

The sinking feeling in Fuyutsuki's spine began to spread, a frigid east wind blew through the city's heat wave. "That's not the Ikari I knew."  
那种沉甸甸的感觉在冬月的脊梁上蔓延开来，一股寒风穿透了城市的热浪。“这不是我所认识的碇。”

"People change. I mean, can you blame him?" Aida leaned closer, "This is supposed to be the safest city in the world, right? That's why everybody comes here. But I don't know, after what happened to Kensuke and his friend, how can this be safe? How is any of this safe? If something goes wrong, if one of those… things took one step out of place, it could've been a blood-bath. And that's just gonna keep happening again, and again-"  
"人会变的。我是说，你能怪他吗？" 艾达凑得更近了，"这应该是世界上最安全的城市，对吧？这就是为什么大家都来这里。但我不明白，在健介和他的朋友出事后，这怎么还能算安全？这一切怎么可能安全？如果有事发生，如果那些……东西稍微出点差错，就可能是一场大屠杀。而且这种事只会一次又一次地发生……"

"Be careful of what you say, Aida." Fuyutsuki said softly.  
"说话要小心，艾达。" 冬月轻声说道。"

"How would you feel if Ayanami was put in a situation like that?" Aida didn't get a response. "You know I'm right."  
"如果绫波处在那种境地，你会怎么想？" 艾达没有得到回应。"你知道我是对的。"

Fuyutsuki's breathing grew ragged, his hands trembled as they rested on the desk, "Please… just be careful of what you say."  
冬月呼吸变得急促，双手颤抖着放在桌上，“请……说话小心些。”

Aida frowned, "Why? It's not like anyone can hear what we're talking about, right?"  
Aida 皱起眉头，“为什么？又没人能听到我们在说什么，对吧？”

The classroom full of fathers began to talk louder, as though the heat agitated their conversations.  
教室里满是父亲的家长们开始提高嗓门交谈，仿佛热浪加剧了他们的对话。

Fuyutsuki stared at him wearily.  
冬月疲惫地盯着他。

"...Right?" “……对吧？”

A car from outside _screeched_ to a sharp stop. A growing group of fathers clambered to the window in curiosity and after a moment, grew excited.  
外面一辆车猛地急刹车停下。一群父亲好奇地涌向窗户，片刻后，他们变得兴奋起来。

Fuyutsuki and Aida stared at each other and wordlessly agreed to investigate. The two older men struggled to get out of the child sized desks and joined the crowd at the far end of the window.  
冬月和相田对视一眼，无声地达成共识，决定展开调查。两位年长者费力地从儿童尺寸的课桌中脱身，加入到窗子远端的围观人群中。

"She's here!" One of the men called out, "They're both here!" followed by a mix of frantic and confused hollering.  
“她在这里！”其中一人喊道，“她们都在这儿！”紧接着是一阵慌乱与困惑交织的喧哗。

"What is it now, Suzuhara?" Hajime asked as he lowered his sunglasses to get a better look.  
“这次又是什么，铃原？” Hajime 问道，同时将太阳镜向下拉了拉，以便更清楚地观察。

"It's Akagi!" The elder Suzuhara hooted, "A-and the Operations Director!"  
"是赤木！" 铃原长老欢呼道，"还有作战部长！"

Fuyutsuki's eyes widened and he leaned closer into the glared window to make out the two silhouettes, he moved to another window and pushed one of the men aside, "Please excuse me."  
冬月眼睛睁大，他凑近被阳光直射的窗户，试图辨认出那两个身影，他移到另一扇窗前，推开其中一人，"请原谅。"

Out from the Director's prized possession, her blue alpine, was Katsuragi herself and a pale woman with a wide brimmed hat and a blue vest. They emerged from the car to a series of wolf whistles from their co-workers.  
从部长珍爱的蓝色阿尔卑斯车中，走出了葛城美里本人和一个戴着宽边帽、身穿蓝色背心的苍白女子。她们从车里出来时，同事们纷纷吹起了口哨。

In response to the cat calls, the women in the hat pulled the brim down even lower, much to Fuyutsuki's frustration.  
面对那些口哨声，戴帽子的女士将帽檐拉得更低，这让冬月感到更加沮丧。

In response to her friend's shyness, Misato pulled the hat off to reveal a bob of Burgundy hair.  
为了缓解朋友的羞涩，美里摘下帽子，露出一头勃艮第色的短发。

It was only the younger Akagi, Ritsuko. Fuyutsuki exhaled out a breath of relief. The cheers intensified.  
原来是更年轻的赤木律子。冬月松了一口气，欢呼声愈发高涨。

Aida shook his head, "Good grief. This heat drove these lunatics insane."  
艾达摇了摇头，“天哪，这热浪把这些人逼疯了。”

"I'll say." Kensuke said among the crowd of fathers.  
“我同意。”健介在父亲们的人群中说道。

Aida looked down at the boy, who held a camera and documented the new arrivals. "Kensuke!" Aida swiped for his son's camera. "Enough with that! What did we talk about?"  
艾达低头看着那个男孩，他正拿着相机记录新来的人。“健介！”艾达伸手去抢儿子的相机。“够了！我们之前怎么说的？”

"It's not what it looks like, I swear!" Kensuke hastily switched the camera lens with an intense precision, "Ikari and Langley's guardians sell for over three times my usual rate, Hajime, three times! It's purely business!"  
"这不是你想象的那样，我发誓！" 健介急忙以精准的动作更换了相机镜头，"碇和绫波的监护人照片，价格是我平常的三倍，三倍啊， Hajime！这纯粹是生意！"

Fuyutsuki's relief was swiftly crushed at the sight of a prototype, albeit modified vintage sports car that cruised into the parking lot, the only one in the world that existed.  
看到一辆原型车，尽管是改装过的复古跑车驶入停车场，Fuyutsuki 的宽慰迅速被碾碎，这是世界上唯一存在的。

It was a ZIS-112 Cyclops, aptly named for its single massive headlight. The Cyclops car had a deep emerald coat, golden trim lined at the ends, and black tinted windows.  
这是一辆 ZIS-112 独眼巨人，恰如其名，因其巨大的单个前灯而得名。独眼巨人车拥有深绿色的车身，金色装饰线条点缀在边缘，以及黑色涂层的窗户。

Hajime Aida spoke under his breath as he yanked at the camera. "Are you trying to get me fired?"  
会堂庚在拽着相机时低声说道：“你是想让我被炒鱿鱼吗？”

Kensuke yanked back, and whispered sharply, "Guess what, half these people are my customers!" He ducked out of his father's reach and ran to Fuyutsuki's side, his camera primed.  
健介用力拽回，急促地低语：“猜猜看，这里一半的人都是我的客户！”他躲开父亲的抓握，跑到冬月身边，相机已准备就绪。

Naoko stepped out of the car, despite the extreme heat she wore an indigo coat and no sunglasses. "Well, isn't this a coincidence!" She said to Ritsuko and Misato. "Mind if I join you?"  
尽管酷热难耐，直子还是穿着一件靛蓝外套，没有戴太阳镜就下了车。她对律子和美里说：“哎呀，真是巧了！介意我加入你们吗？”

"O-oh, hello Mother!" Ritsuko responded.  
"哦-哦，妈妈你好！" 律子回应道。

"Sure!" "当然！"

Naoko wrapped her arms around the two women and walked towards the school. She looked up at the window.  
直子用双臂环抱着两位女士，向学校走去。她抬头看向窗户。

The fathers that were hovered over the window instantly backed away and returned to their seats.  
那些聚集在窗边的父亲们立刻后退，回到了自己的座位上。

"Put the camera down." Fuyutsuki ordered.  
"把相机放下。" 冬月命令道。

Kensuke looked confusingly at him, then at the long gone crowd. "What?"  
剑介困惑地看着他，然后又看向早已散去的人群。"什么？"

"Now!" Fuyustuki barked back, he snatched the camera and pressed the reel button to delete the footage. He pressed the playback to be sure.  
"现在！" 冬月厉声回应，他夺过相机，按下卷轴按钮删除录像。他按下播放键以确认。

"Hey what gives old man? That's mine!"  
"嘿，老家伙，你这是干嘛？那是我的！"

Aida pulled his son back, "Do you know who that is?"  
艾达拉住他的儿子，"你知道那是谁吗？"

Fuyutsuki's chest sank, it was too late. In the footage, Naoko looked up through the harsh sunlight and locked eyes with the camera.  
冬月的心沉了下去，已经太迟了。在画面中，直子透过刺眼的阳光抬头望向镜头，目光交汇。

She beamed at him. 她对他展颜一笑。

"That's Commander Akagi!"  
“那是赤城指挥官！”

The three women down below swung the heavy doors open, and Kensuke flinched when it slammed shut. He inspected the clip he recorded of the Commander.  
下面的三位女性用力推开沉重的门，门砰然关闭时，健介不禁一缩。他检查起自己录下的指挥官片段。

"...Oh." “……哦。”

---

The elevator _dinged_ at the far end of the hallway, followed by the echoed footsteps. The urgent pace set the workers into unease and slowly, a chorus of bouncing legs grew.  
电梯在走廊尽头叮的一声响起，紧接着是回荡的脚步声。急促的步伐让工人们感到不安，渐渐地，一阵跳动的腿脚声汇成了合唱。

The boy got to his better senses and dashed out of the classroom to join his friends. Not for the same reasons Fuyutsuki would've warned the boy if he had the courage to do so but hopefully, Kensuke Aida would disappear among his peers long enough for Naoko to be distracted by some other prospective pet project.  
男孩恢复了些理智，冲出教室去找他的朋友们。如果不是出于同样的原因，如果他有勇气的话，冬月会警告那个男孩，但希望，相田健介能混在同龄人中足够久，让直子被其他潜在的宠物项目分心。

Naoko reached their end of the hallway faster than it naturally should have taken, as evident by how her two followers lagged behind. Thankfully, Fuyutsuki disappeared in the classroom and was unnoticed with his brown coat and cap. Naoko stalked right into the cluster of students that waited outside the hallway to greet her favorites.  
直子比自然应该花费的时间更快地到达了走廊的尽头，从她两个追随者落后的事实可以看出。幸运的是，冬月消失在教室里，他那棕色的大衣和帽子未被察觉。直子径直走进了聚集在走廊外等待迎接她最爱学生的人群中。

If it weren't obvious by now who the pilots were among the students of class 2-A, and likely to the public eye, it was clear by Naoko's behavior that it wasn't a concern for her. Ritsuko and Dr. Katsuragi's daughter followed closely behind Naoko as she greeted Shinji, looking more like siblings about to be left in charge by their mother rather than the two adults responsible for the lives of these children. They allowed her to take the lead.  
如果到现在还不明显谁是 2-A 班的学生中的驾驶员，以及可能对公众来说，对直子来说这显然不是她关心的问题。律子和碇博士的女儿紧跟在直子身后，向真嗣打招呼，看起来更像是要被母亲留下来照顾的兄妹，而不是负责这些孩子生命的两个成年人。她们让她带头。

Naoko gave Shinji's shoulder an affectionate squeeze as she passed by him- and set her sights on Rei.  
直子经过真嗣时，亲切地捏了捏他的肩膀——然后将目光投向了绫波。

She locked eyes with Fuyutsuki through the hallway window, all the way to the far end of the classroom where he sat. Naoko smiled, she didn't break eye contact as she leaned down to eye level with Rei and whispered in her ear.  
她透过走廊窗户与教室另一端坐在那里的冬月对视。直子微笑着，她没有移开视线，而是弯下腰与绫波平视，并在她耳边低语。

Fuyutsuki's head cooked away at the moisture in his eyes, this whole ordeal felt like a mirage in this torrid spring morning.  
冬月头上的汗水蒸发了眼中的湿气，这一切在这炎热的春日早晨仿佛是一场海市蜃楼。

The classroom door was pushed open and the NERV workers struggled out of their child-sized desks and stood at attention as their Commander entered the classroom.  
教室门被推开，NERV 的工作人员们费力地从儿童尺寸的课桌中挣扎出来，站得笔直，迎接指挥官的到来。

Naoko strode to the center with a scowl on her face. "What's going on here? Aren't you all supposed to be at work?" She put her hands on her hips and scanned the classroom.  
直子皱着眉头大步走到教室中央。“这里发生了什么？你们不是都应该在工作吗？”她双手叉腰，扫视着整个教室。

The workers all side-eyed each other, hoping that someone else would speak up.  
工人们彼此斜眼相望，希望有人能率先开口。

The Commander held back a wobbling smile until a stifled giggle cracked out, "I'm joking! I'm joking-" Naoko covered her face, " I'm sorry, I couldn't resist. I just thought I'd pop on by and say hello!"  
指挥官强忍住颤抖的微笑，直到一声压抑的笑声打破了沉默，“我开玩笑的！开玩笑的——”直子捂住脸，“对不起，我忍不住。我只是想顺便过来打个招呼！”

A few of the parents gasped in astonishment. Some of the eager workers took the opportunity to bow and the rest followed suit. "T-thank you, Commander!"  
几位家长惊讶地倒吸一口气。一些热切的工人趁机鞠躬，其他人也纷纷效仿。“谢谢您，指挥官！”

There were some things about Gendo Ikari's brief tenure as Commander that Fuyutsuki couldn't help but admit that he missed.  
关于碇源堂短暂担任司令的那段时期，有一些事情是副司令冬月不得不承认自己怀念的。

Hajime turned his gaze to see that the old man Fuyutsuki stood like a tower at his full height.  
Hajime 转头望去，只见老者冬月如同一座高塔般矗立，身姿挺拔。

A few more quiet 'thank you's' followed.  
随后又传来了几声轻柔的‘谢谢’。

Naoko nodded and smiled as she locked eyes with Fuyutsuki. "Kozo!" She chirped, "I didn't know you had a little one, who's the lucky lady?"  
直子点头微笑，与冬月对视。“高雄！”她欢快地说，“没想到你有个小宝贝，是哪位幸运女士呢？”

He stared dully at her.  
他无精打采地盯着她。

The Commander giggled. "I'm just kidding, I know who. How are you, you old fox?"  
指挥官咯咯笑道：“开个玩笑，我知道是谁。你还好吗，你这老狐狸？”

Fuyutsuki cleared his throat and offered a jutted smile, "I'm well. Thank you."  
冬月清了清嗓子，挤出一个勉强的微笑，“我很好，谢谢。”

"Good, that's good- Why are you all standing?" Naoko motioned for the other workers to sit, "Please, sit- you're killing me, relax!" She turned to Misato and Ritsuko, who waited by the door frame, "You girls sit, you're a part of this too!"  
“好，很好——你们都站着干嘛？”直子示意其他工作人员坐下，“请坐，你们这样我都要窒息了，放松点！”她转向门口的律子和美里，“你们俩也坐下，这也是你们的事！”

Hesitantly, they joined in the few empty seats.  
他们犹豫了一下，坐进了仅剩的几个空位。

"Now, how are you all today?"  
"那么，大家今天过得怎么样？"

Fuyutsuki slowly sat down and lowered his head.  
冬月缓缓坐下，低下了头。

Hajime spoke up, "To be honest, I feel like I'm in detention." The other workers chuckled as they tried to get comfortable in the child sized seats.  
Hajime 开口道，“老实说，我感觉自己像是在关禁闭。”其他工人在儿童尺寸的座位上努力调整姿势，发出一阵轻笑。

Naoko laughed, "Right! I can see how all of this could feel a little silly, but it's good to be in our kids' perspectives, right? They are the future after all."  
直子笑了，“对啊！我能理解这一切可能显得有点傻，但站在我们孩子的角度看问题挺好的，不是吗？毕竟他们才是未来。”

"We should get our future some better air conditioning."  
“我们应该给我们的未来装上更好的空调。”

The classroom was so quiet you could hear the faltering AC in question. The Commander stared at Hajime for a moment, "You know what? You're absolutely right, I'll get someone right on that. What was your name?"  
教室里静得连那台有问题的空调的颤动声都能听见。指挥官盯着 Hajime 看了一会儿，“你知道吗？你说得完全正确，我马上就让人去处理。你叫什么名字？”

"Aida Hajime, Ma'am." "相田八郎，女士。"

"Hajime. I like your attitude, Hajime! That's what's going to save us, gentlemen. Not money, not weapons. Initiative."  
"八郎。我喜欢你的态度，八郎！这就是能拯救我们的东西，各位。不是金钱，不是武器。是主动性。"

Naoko allowed for a moment of silence as she scanned the crowd. "Isn't it so lovely to have a tradition like this that brings us all together? I wanted to thank you gentlemen, and ladies, all of you, so… so much for being here. I can't admire enough how you all painstakingly balance two of the most important jobs on the planet." She raised two fingers, "Saving the world, and being a parent. But that's what we do here at NERV, isn't it? We do this to protect our own."  
直子让大家安静了一会儿，她扫视着人群。“有这样一种传统把我们聚集在一起，不是很美好吗？我想感谢各位，先生们，女士们，你们所有人，非常感谢你们能来。我无法充分赞赏你们是如何精心平衡地球上最重要的两份工作。”她举起两根手指，“拯救世界，和为人父母。但这就是我们在 NERV 所做的，不是吗？我们这样做是为了保护我们自己。”

The men looked at each other and murmured in agreement.  
男人们相互对视，低声表示同意。

"And single parents too, God. I knew what that was like. To add more weight to such a burden. I can't thank you all enough for selflessly toiling and caring for our future. It's been a hard fifteen years… we've all lost people we care about. That pain from being apart from them…is almost unbearable sometimes. But we move on, we learn to surpass our predecessors for the sake of the future."  
“还有单亲父母们，天啊。我知道那是什么感觉。在如此重担上再加码。我无法充分感谢你们无私的辛劳和对我们未来的关怀。这十五年来一直很艰难……我们都失去了所关心的人。与他们分离的痛苦……有时几乎难以忍受。但我们继续前进，为了未来，我们学会超越前人。”

Naoko pointed to the children outside in the hallway, "To express my gratitude, while me and the girls travel out to deal with some very important business that will benefit NERV, I want you boys to have the day off!" The workers looked at each other excitedly. "Now I know these annual parent-teacher meetings normally follow with you taking your children to work, but do you know what I also know? I know the country we live in demands we put everything we have into our jobs, but we can't forget about family, can we? The way I see it, you're all a part of my family too!"  
直子指着走廊外的孩子们说：“为了表达我的感激之情，当我和女孩们外出处理一些对 NERV 极为重要的事务时，我希望你们男孩们能放一天假！”工人们兴奋地相互看着。“我知道这些年度家长会通常会接着带孩子们去工作，但你们知道我还知道什么吗？我知道我们生活的国家要求我们全力以赴投入工作，但我们不能忘记家庭，对吧？在我看来，你们也都是我的家人！”

Fuyutsuki suppressed a groan and looked to the hallway window, Shinji listened closely.  
冬月压下呻吟，望向走廊的窗户，真嗣仔细聆听。

"I truly can't thank you enough for being a part of NERV's family… So please, keep doing what you're doing and hold your head up with pride. I know here at NERV we make Evangelions- and they're the heroes who save the day, but as far as I'm concerned, all of you?" Naoko pointed to the class, "You're the unsung heroes."  
“我实在无法感谢你们成为 NERV 家庭的一部分……所以请继续你们正在做的事情，并自豪地昂起头。我知道在 NERV 这里，我们制造了 EVA——他们是拯救世界的英雄，但在我看来，你们所有人？”直子指向班级，“你们才是幕后英雄。”

Naoko exhaled sharply and stared at her audience. To them, she was now their champion. She let out an embarrassed laugh and wiped her eyes, "I'm sorry, I was just supposed to come and grab the usual suspects. Now here I am giving speeches and getting all emotional."  
直子猛地呼出一口气，凝视着她的听众。对他们来说，她现在是他们的捍卫者。她尴尬地笑了笑，擦了擦眼睛，“对不起，我本来只是来抓几个惯犯的。现在我却在这里发表演讲，情绪激动。”

The men exclaimed in a commotional attempt to reassure her, "No, no, no, it's all right-"  
男人们试图安慰她，连声说道：“不，不，不，没事的——”

"It's okay to cry!" “哭出来也没关系！”

"Nobody's ever told me that..."  
“从来没有人这样告诉过我……”

"I swear I'll hold my head up with pride, Commander!"  
"我发誓我会骄傲地昂首挺胸，指挥官！"

Fuyutsuki turned to Aida and stared at him with great weariness. Aida in response, raised his eyebrow.  
冬月转向相田，以极大的疲惫注视着他。相田则回应地挑了挑眉。

Class 1-A's teacher opened the door of his office from the far end of the room, having finally noticed the commotion. "Oh, Commander!"  
1-A 班的老师从房间的另一端打开了办公室的门，终于注意到了这场骚动。“哦，指挥官！”

"Ken! So good to see you." Naoko waved to him, "Don't mind me, I'm just here to grab some of the kids. You know the drill." The teacher bowed and retreated back into his office. The Commander exited the classroom, "Shinji, Rei, come along! We all have something very important to discuss."  
"健！很高兴见到你。" 直子向他挥手，"别管我，我只是来接几个孩子的。你懂的。" 老师鞠了一躬，退回到他的办公室。指挥官走出教室，"真嗣，丽，过来！我们有些非常重要的事情要讨论。"

Misato turned to Ritsuko for answers, but she only shrugged in response.  
美里转向律子寻求答案，但她只是耸了耸肩作为回应。

"Asuka, you rascal, you're coming too-"  
"明日香，你这个小淘气，你也一起来-"

"Um- excuse me, Commander?" Misato followed her out of the class. "Aren't they supposed to be with us for the conference?"  
"嗯——打扰一下，指挥官？" 美里跟着她走出了教室。"他们不是应该和我们一起参加会议吗？"

Naoko gathered the three children together. "Don't worry, you and Ritsuko are coming too. And I'm sure Ken can reschedule us." She leaned her head back into the classroom. "Isn't that right, Ken?"  
直子把三个孩子聚在一起。"别担心，你和律子也会来的。我相信健可以为我们重新安排时间。"她把头探回教室。"对吧，健？"

"Yes 'mam!" The teacher's voice called back out from his office.  
"是的，女士！" 老师的声音从他的办公室里传了出来。

"Commander, is this about… the other conference? I thought we had time today."  
"指挥官，这是关于……另一场会议的事吗？我以为我们今天有时间。"

"Nope." "不记得。"

"But-" “但是——”

"No buts! This takes precedence." Naoko strode out of the room, and the rest of its occupants stared at the now vacant spot the Commander had just occupied and looked around the room, as though they had just gotten off a strange roller coaster.  
"没有但是！这件事优先处理。" 直子大步走出房间，其余的人盯着指挥官刚刚占据的空位，环顾四周，仿佛刚从一场奇异的过山车上下来。

Naoko popped her head back into the classroom. "Oh, you know what? I meant to get you guys some ice cream. It's so hot out here, I'm sorry. Next year, I promise!"  
直子又探头回到教室。"哦，对了？我本来想给你们带些冰淇淋的。外面太热了，抱歉。明年，我保证！"

"It's alright!" “没事的！”

"Don't worry about it!" "别担心！"

"Thank you for visiting us, Commander!"  
"感谢您的来访，指挥官！"

Fuyutski watched as the Commander whisked away the three children. "Oh, Kozo?"  
冬月看着指挥官迅速带走了三个孩子。“哦，高雄？”

He looked up to see the Commander's head poke out the door frame, "I almost forgot, you need to come with us as well!" She beamed at him, her nails curled around the frame. "There's a lot you should hear. Why don't we all meet at the parking lot?"  
他抬头一看，只见指挥官的脑袋从门框里探出来，“我差点忘了，你也得跟我们一起来！”她朝他微笑着，手指紧扣着门框。“有很多事情你该听听。不如我们都在停车场集合吧？”

Fuyutsuki let out a sharp breath as he rose from the desk, "Of course."  
冬月深吸一口气，从桌边站起身，“当然。”

As he passed by Hajime, he found his new friend stare at him and wordlessly ask for an explanation. Fuyustuki only smirked and nodded in response.  
当他经过 Hajime 时，发现新朋友正盯着他，无声地寻求解释。冬月只是微微一笑，点头回应。

Hajime accepted that he wouldn't get one from the melancholic old man and nodded back. He wiped the waterfall of sweat off his forehead and sighed. The irrational fears that sat in his stomach were all but confirmed by the way Fuyutsuki had stared at the beloved Commander with disgust.  
Hajime 接受了从那位忧郁的老人那里得不到答案的事实，点头回应。他擦去额头上的瀑布般的汗水，叹了口气。腹中的无端恐惧几乎被副校长对敬爱的司令那厌恶的眼神所证实。

"Hajime Aida?" A voice called out, he turned to see the Teacher stare at him from outside the office, "I believe you're up first."  
"Hajime Aida？"一个声音喊道，他转身看到老师从办公室外盯着他，"我想你是第一个。"

"Right," Hajime stood up and motioned to the students that waited outside my classroom, "I'll just go grab my kid." He walked past the cramped seats of his fellow peers, their spirits were now lifted by their surprise visit. Hajime opened the door and spoke aimlessly. "Kensuke, c'mon, we're up first-" He scanned the classroom, his son was nowhere to be found. "...Kensuke? What-"  
"好的，"Hajime 站起来，示意在教室外等候的学生们，"我去接我的孩子。"他走过拥挤的座位，同伴们的精神因意外的来访而振奋。Hajime 打开门，随意地说道："Kensuke，快点，我们第一个——"他扫视教室，儿子却不见踪影。"...Kensuke？什么——"

Hajime saw Kensuke's friend, Suzuhara's son, lean suspiciously against the wall with another shorter boy. They tried to hide his faces, "Toji, where did Kensuke go?"  
Hajime 看到 Kensuke 的朋友，铃原的儿子，可疑地靠在墙上，旁边还有一个较矮的男孩。他们试图遮住脸，“Toji，Kensuke 去哪儿了？”

"Kensuke? I think he uh-" Toji cleared his throat, "-I think he went to the men's room."  
“Kensuke？我想他呃——” Toji 清了清嗓子，“——我想他去洗手间了。”

"Huh?" The shorter boy next to Toji spoke up, "No he didn't-"  
“嗯？” Toji 旁边的矮个男孩开口了，“不，他没去——”

"Dude, shut up-" "哥们，闭嘴-"

Keita pointed down the hall, "-Pretty sure he went after the Commander."  
Keita 指着走廊的另一头，""-我敢肯定他是去找指挥官了。""

Hajime saw the doors close at the far end of the hand. "Kensuke- Kensuke!" He broke into a hastened walk, "Godammit!"  
Hajime 看到远处的门关上了。 "Kensuke- Kensuke!" 他加快了脚步，"该死！""

Toji elbowed his much shorter companion, "Keita, you damn snitch- we were supposed to cover for him!"  
冬二用胳膊肘顶了顶比他矮得多的同伴，“圭太，你这个该死的告密者——我们本来说好要帮他打掩护的！”

"What? How was I supposed to know? You guys need to communicate better." Keita stared at the doors at the far end of the hall as they swung to a stop. "Man… I would not mess with that lady."  
“什么？我怎么可能知道？你们得沟通得更清楚些。”圭太盯着大厅尽头缓缓停下的门，“老兄……我可不想惹那位女士。”

Toji rubbed the back of his head, "I dunno, she seemed pretty nice to me."  
冬二揉了揉后脑勺，“我不觉得啊，她对我挺友好的。”

---

Naoko hummed as she strolled down the sweltering halls of the school and avoided the cracks in the floor tiles. She looked up at the school's ill-placed sky light that poured directly into the halls with little to no respite. Naoko peered through the glare and imaged what hid in front of the sun to make its rays so abnormally focused. The heat did indeed burn into her as it did everyone else but today, she had a very narrow window.  
直子哼着小曲，漫步在闷热的学校走廊上，小心翼翼地避开地板瓷砖的裂缝。她抬头望向那扇位置不佳的天窗，阳光毫无遮挡地直射进来。直子透过刺眼的光线，想象着太阳前方隐藏着什么，使得光线如此异常集中。热浪确实如火般灼烧着她，也灼烧着其他人，但今天，她有一个非常狭窄的时间窗口。

"Wait!" A young voice cried out. The Commander didn't glance over to the boy as he ran closer. The sandy-haired boy with glasses bowed low with his hands as he attempted to match her pace, "Please pardon my interruption, 'mam." The Commander didn't respond. "...M-mam?"  
"等等！"一个年轻的声音喊道。指挥官没有回头看向那个跑近的男孩。金棕色头发、戴着眼镜的男孩鞠躬致意，双手伸出，试图跟上她的步伐，"请原谅我的打断，女士。"指挥官没有回应。"...女士？"

"Well?" The Commander finally said. "You haven't interrupted me yet."  
"那么？"指挥官终于开口了。"你还没打断我呢。"

"O-oh, well." The boy stammered, "I just wanted to say, while you're here, if you're ever looking for another pilot, I'd like to offer myself up. And…I have a lot of knowledge on the field."  
"哦-哦，这样啊。" 男孩结结巴巴地说，"我只是想说，既然你在这里，如果你需要另一位驾驶员，我愿意自荐。而且……我对这个领域有很多了解。"

"Dear, to be qualified as one of my Evangelion pilots would mean that you were prepared for such a duty since you were a small child, or if you did know much on the field, you were hand picked by the MAGI system. Or you possess the privilege of nepotism. Do you fit in one of those categories?" Naoko finally turned to scan the boy's face and stopped walking as they reached the elevator, "Which one were you again?"  
"亲爱的，要成为我的 EVA 驾驶员之一，意味着你从小就被训练承担这样的职责，或者你对这个领域非常了解，被 MAGI 系统亲自挑选。或者你拥有裙带关系的特权。你属于哪一类呢？" 直子终于转过身来打量男孩的脸，当他们走到电梯前时停下了脚步，"你刚才说你是哪一类来着？"

The boy struggled to find the words as he stood still.  
男孩站在原地，努力寻找合适的言辞。

"Don't I know you from somewhere?" Naoko looked close at the boy, certainly, he wasn't one of the runt's that Asari had thrown into her little nest to gauge her defenses.  
"我是不是在哪里见过你？" 直子仔细打量着那个男孩，当然，他不是阿萨里扔进她小巢穴里那些小家伙中的一个，用来测试她的防御能力。

Then it clicked in her head.  
然后她脑海中灵光一闪。

"Now I remember-" She playfully wagged her finger at him, "You're that boy with the camera. The one that my pilots rescued last month. But I suppose you already know that it was Shinji who grabbed you there." The Commander smiled at him, "You seem like a smart boy."  
"现在我想起来了——" 她俏皮地朝他晃了晃手指，"你就是那个带着相机的男孩。上个月我的飞行员救过的那个。不过我想你已经知道是真嗣在那里抓住了你。" 指挥官对他微笑着，"你看起来挺聪明的。

"Y-yes. That was me. I'm Kensuke Aida." The boy chuckled nervously and bowed low enough to hide his face, "I swear I deleted that footage by the way."  
"是的，那是我。我是相田剑介。" 男孩紧张地笑了笑，鞠躬深到足以隐藏他的脸，"顺便说一句，我发誓我已经删除了那段视频。"

Naoko waved her hand dismissively, "Don't worry, I can tell that you're very passionate about my work, and I admire that, Kensuke. But maybe watch where you point that camera, hmm? Who knows what kind of trouble that could lead you to."  
直子不以为意地挥了挥手，"别担心，我能看出你对我的作品非常热情，我很欣赏这一点，剑介。但也许注意一下你把相机对准哪里，嗯？谁知道那会给你带来什么样的麻烦。"

"Well-" "嗯——"

"That incident with the Angel must have been really scary for you."  
“那次与使徒的事件对你来说一定非常可怕。”

"Yeah…" "是啊……"

Naoko squatted down to his eye level. "Good thing Shinji came and saved you boys when he did. I bet you must've been really glad that he was there."  
直子蹲下身来与他平视。“幸好真嗣及时赶来救了你们。我猜你当时一定很庆幸他在那里。”

Kensukednodded again, "Yes, I'm grateful to him, and to you- that you're here to protect us. And I see now why we need the EVA's. That's why I want to-"  
健介再次点头，“是的，我很感激他，也感激你——你在这里保护我们。我现在明白了为什么我们需要 EVA。这就是为什么我想——”

"No-no-" Naoko shushed him, "Don't tell me why you want to pilot the EVA, tell me, what are you willing to face in return? What are you willing to risk?"  
"不不-" 直子轻声制止他，"别告诉我你为什么想驾驶 EVA，告诉我，你愿意面对什么？你愿意冒什么风险？"

"...I…." "...我…."

Naoko patted his shoulder, "It's okay, you don't have to tell me now. You know, I'm sorry for my bluntness earlier, genuinely, I thought you were somebody else. I for one think that you're very brave to approach me, I need initiative in my team."  
直子拍了拍他的肩膀，"没关系，你现在不必告诉我。你知道吗，我为之前的直率道歉，真的，我以为你是别人。我个人认为你很勇敢，敢来找我，我的团队需要这种主动性。"

Kensuke's face lit up, "T-thank you Commander! You won't regret this-"  
健介的脸上绽放出光芒，“谢谢指挥官！您不会后悔的——”

"Slow down, I didn't say yes, and please, call me Naoko." Naoko looked up to see a man whom she assumed to be Kensuke's father hurry towards them and winked at the boy, "If I need to squeeze someone in, I'll be sure to think of you first.  
“慢点，我还没答应呢，而且请叫我直子。”直子抬头看到一个她猜是健介父亲的男人快步向他们走来，并对男孩眨了眨眼，“如果需要插个人进来，我会优先考虑你的。”

"Thank you, Naoko-" Kensuke bowed eagerly. "-Thank you!"  
“谢谢你，直子——”健介急切地鞠了一躬。“——谢谢！”

"But it'll be our little secret…"  
"但这是我们的小秘密……"

"Kensuke!" The boy's father, that blonde man that complained about the AC from earlier, jogged towards them, "Kensuke, what did I tell you?" He turned to Naoko, "I'm sorry if he bothered you, 'mam."  
"健介！" 男孩的父亲，那个之前抱怨空调的金发男子，小跑着朝他们过来，"健介，我跟你说过什么？" 他转向直子，"抱歉，如果他打扰到您了，女士。"

"Oh no bother at all, I have to say-" Naoko attempted to remember the man's name. Hideo? "...Sir, you have a bright young man there. But maybe he should watch it with the…" Naoko mimed taking a photo of the two and playfully clicked twice.  
"哦，一点也没打扰，我得说——" 直子试图回忆起那个男人的名字。英夫？"……先生，您有个聪明伶俐的孩子。不过他可能得注意一下……" 直子比划着给两人拍照的动作，俏皮地按了两下。

Kensuke proved to be a model of his father as the man nodded in the same rigid, militant manner, "It won't happen again, Ma'am. I'll have the camera taken away."  
健介完美地模仿了他父亲的模样，那男人同样僵硬、军人气十足地点头道：“不会再发生了，女士。我会让人把相机拿走。”

"What!? Wait, wait, Dad-"  
“什么！？等等，等等，爸爸——”

"Oh, so now it's dad?"  
“哦，现在变成爸爸了？”

"Boys, boys, there's no need to go that far. What are we, the Kempeitai?" Naoko let out a shrill laugh, "I'm just saying be careful for legal reasons, you two seem nice, I wouldn't want you boys to be liable for anything."  
"好了，好了，没必要做到那个地步。我们又不是宪兵队？" 直子尖声笑道，"我只是提醒你们出于法律考虑要小心，你们俩看起来挺不错的，我不想你们因此承担什么责任。"

"Of course, yes." "当然，是的。"

"I wouldn't want to deny his talents, they were nice shots after all." Naoko looked down at Kensuke and winked. A small, hopeful smile grew on the boy's face. Naoko let out a sigh as she pushed the elevator's button and walked inside, "Well! It was nice meeting you two, but I do have people waiting for me for an important meeting back at headquarters."  
"我当然不会否认他的才能，毕竟那些都是好球。" 直子低头看着健介，眨了眨眼。男孩脸上露出了小小的、充满希望的微笑。直子叹了口气，按下电梯按钮走了进去，"那么！很高兴遇见你们两位，但我确实有人在总部等我参加一个重要会议。"

Hajime nodded, "Right, we won't keep you 'mam. Thank you." He bowed low, and after a moment nudged Kensuke to do the same.  
Hajime 点了点头，“好的，我们不打扰您了，谢谢。”他深深鞠了一躬，过了一会儿还轻轻推了推 Kensuke，示意他也这么做。

Naoko nodded at them as the elevator doors closed.  
电梯门关闭时，Naoko 向他们点了点头。

"See, Hajime? That's how you network."  
“看吧，Hajime？这才是建立人脉的方式。”

"I swear to God, Kensuke, not another word…"  
"我发誓，健介，别再说了……"

[Break] [中断]

Naoko trail-blazed through the scorching highway. "Isn't this nice? How long has it been since the three of us went on a drive together? Just like the good old days."  
直子在炙热的高速公路上疾驰。“这不是很好吗？我们三个一起开车出去玩，已经多久没有过了？就像以前那些美好的时光。”

"Well, you've been busy." Asuka offered in a tone friendlier than she would offer to anyone else. "It's understandable."  
"嗯，你一直很忙。" 明日香用一种比对其他人更友好的语气说道，"这可以理解。"

Rei looked out the window, "I do not recall…"  
绫波看向窗外，"我不记得……"

Naoko looked up through the rearview mirror. "You don't? I used to take you and Asuka for some ice cream whenever I had free time, remember? You were both very little, so I guess it's understandable."  
直子透过后视镜抬头看了一眼。"你不记得了吗？我以前一有空就会带你和明日香去吃冰淇淋，记得吗？你们那时都还很小，所以我想这可以理解。"

"Y-yeah." Asuka looked at Rei.  
“嗯，嗯。” 明日香看着绫波。

Rei nodded, "I see." 绫波点点头，“我明白了。”

After another moment of silence, Naoko sighed, "I'm sorry girls, I know I gave you two a hard time back then. But that was just because I wanted you two to be the best pilots that you could be. I hope you understand."  
又是一阵沉默后，直子叹了口气，“对不起，姑娘们，我知道那时我给你们俩带来了不少麻烦。但那只是因为我希望你们能成为最优秀的驾驶员。希望你们能理解。”

"We do," Asuka replied, "You were under a lot of stress back then."  
"我们会的，" 明日香回答，"你那时承受了很大的压力。"

She let out a soft laugh, "Oh I still am, I've just learnt how to manage it better." Naoko cleared her throat. "So Rei, did you know that Mr. Fuyutuski would be coming to the conference on your behalf today?"  
她轻声笑道，"哦，我现在依然如此，只是学会了更好地管理它。" 直子清了清嗓子。"那么，绫波，你知道今天副司令会代表你出席那个会议吗？"

Rei's head titled, "That is why he was there?"  
绫波歪了歪头，"那就是他在那里的原因吗？"

"I know! How odd. It doesn't make sense to me why he would want to be involved, but I appreciate the effort. I can only assume he had good intentions." Naoko glanced at the reflection of Rei through the rear-view mirror. Her hand rested on her chin, she gazed out the window, miles away.  
"我知道！真奇怪。我不明白他为什么要参与进来，但我很感激他的努力。我只能假设他是出于好意。" 直子瞥了一眼后视镜中丽的样子。她的手托着下巴，目光望向窗外，思绪飘向远方。

That same detached, soulless look that her prized pupil possessed ten years ago. A swell of vexation that only Yui could have ever conjured returned to the cool-headed Commander.  
那种同样冷漠、无魂的表情，正是她十年前引以为傲的学生所拥有的。只有唯才能唤起的恼怒情绪，再次回到了冷静的司令官心中。

"That old coot always did have a soft spot for..."  
"那个老顽固总是对......心软。"

The sun began to burn into Naoko's eyes and coloured spots obscured her vision. When she wiped her eyes, Yui Ikari had taken Rei's seat and gazed out the window in that very same way. Naoko's breath froze in her lungs as she leaned to take a closer look at the mirror, not paying mind to the road.  
阳光开始灼烧直子（Naoko）的眼睛，彩色光斑模糊了她的视线。当她擦眼睛时，碇唯（Yui Ikari）已经坐到了绫波（Rei）的座位上，以同样的方式凝视着窗外。直子屏住呼吸，凑近镜子仔细观察，完全没注意到前方的道路。

"Yu...y-you." “唯...唯...”

Yui caught Naoko staring from her peripherals and locked eyes. She slowly turned her head and smiled through those green, dull dead-fish eyes.  
碇唯从眼角捕捉到直子的凝视，两人的目光交汇。她缓缓转过头，透过那双绿色、死气沉沉的鱼眼，露出了微笑。

"She's all alone." Asuka said.  
"她孤零零一个人。" 明日香说道。

Naoko stared at Asuka, "What?" She glanced at the mirror again, Yui was still smiling.  
直子盯着明日香，"什么？" 她再次看向镜子，唯依然微笑着。

"That's maybe why Mr. Fuyutuski went to the conference. So she seems normal to Ikari. Normal girl, normal life. Less questions."  
"这或许就是为什么冬月先生去参加会议的原因。这样她对碇来说就显得正常了。普通女孩，普通生活。少些疑问。"

"And ah… how do you feel about that?"  
"那么啊……你对这感觉如何？"

Asuka's jaw set tightly as she turned to stare at Yui too, "I don't know if there's a point anymore."  
明日香紧咬牙关，转头也盯着 Yui，"我不知道这还有什么意义。"

Naoko turned around to see that Yui had returned to her visage as the seemingly empty puppet. The Commander breathed a sigh of relief at the return of Rei and smiled, "Well that's not true, you seem perfectly normal to me, Rei."  
直子转过身，看到 Yui 又恢复了她那看似空洞的傀儡模样。司令官松了一口气，看到丽回来，微笑道："那可不对，在我看来你完全正常，丽。"

The smallest of smiles crept up on her face, "Thank you, Naoko." Rei joined Asuka in staring out the window.  
一丝微笑悄然爬上她的脸庞，“谢谢你，直子。”丽跟着明日香一起望向窗外。

"Of course." Naoko let out a hum, "So! What else is new?"  
“当然。”直子发出一声轻哼，“那么！还有什么新鲜事吗？”

"I have made a friend at school. She has four sisters."  
“我在学校交了个朋友。她有四个姐妹。”

"Oh, that's nice-" Naoko tilted her head as she registered Rei's response, "...What was that?"  
"哦，那挺好的——" 直子歪着头，理解了丽的声音，"...那是什么？"

"She has four sisters-" "她有四个姐妹——"

"Honey. No. Do you remember what we talked about? About who your friends are? You don't need any more friends."  
"亲爱的。不。你还记得我们谈过什么吗？关于你的朋友是谁？你不需要更多的朋友了。"

"She ordered me to be her friend."  
"她命令我成为她的朋友。"

"She ordered you." Naoko's vice grip strangled the steering wheel, "...I guess you'll just take orders from anyone then."  
"她命令你。" 直子紧握方向盘的手指几乎要将其勒断，"...我想你那时大概谁的话都会听吧。"

"I did not know what to do-"  
"我不知道该怎么办——"

"-Of course not." Naoko's eyes snapped to Asuka's, "Did you know about this?"  
"-当然没有。" 直子的目光猛地转向明日香，"你知道这件事吗？"

Asuka's head remained low as she shook her head.  
明日香低着头，摇了摇头。

"...Asuka, are you lying to me?" No response. "Asuka."  
"...明日香，你在对我撒谎吗？" 没有回应。"明日香。"

She shook her head again.  
她再次摇了摇头。

Naoko exhaled sharply as the silence overtook the car. All you could hear was the guttural growl of the Cyclop's engine. Naoko pressed on the gas pedal.  
直子猛地呼出一口气，车内被沉默笼罩。你能听到的只有独眼巨人引擎的低沉咆哮。直子踩下了油门。  
"Okay." The car picked up speed down the scorching highway. "What's her name?'  
“好吧。”车子在炙热的高速公路上加速行驶。“她叫什么名字？”

The car began to rattle. Asuka instinctively and quietly grabbed a nearby handlebar.  
汽车开始嘎吱作响。明日香本能地悄悄抓住了附近的把手。

"What's her name?" “她叫什么名字？”

"...Mana Kirishima." Rei said softly.  
“……Mana Kirishima。”丽轻声说道。

Naoko's body stiffened but she didn't say a word, as Asuka tried to look at Rei without making any sudden movements.  
直子的身体僵硬了，但她一言不发，明日香试图在不做出突然动作的情况下看向丽。

"Wanna know who that is, girls? Hmm?" Naoko turned and faced Rei in the backseat, not minding the road ahead as she maintained her speed. "Rei, your little friend is a _JSSDF_ plant. She and her little group of friends were sent by the Japanese military to spy on us and eventually replace us. But I suppose you already know about all of that, don't you Rei?"  
"想知道那是谁吗，姑娘们？嗯？" 直子转过身来面对着后座的丽，毫不在意前方的道路，继续保持车速。"丽，你的小友是日本自卫队的卧底。她和她的那群朋友是被日本军方派来监视我们，并最终取代我们的。不过我想你已经知道这一切了，对吧，丽？"

The tires screeched. 轮胎发出刺耳的摩擦声。

Rei's eyes widened slightly. She glanced at Asuka. "I… I did not. She was nice to me."  
丽的眼睛微微睁大。她瞥了一眼明日香。"我……我不知道。她对我很好。"

"Oh, she was nice just for the sake of being nice? Maybe you're right. The spy they sent to sabotage me just wanted to be friends with you cause she's nice, she's just genuinely interested in you. You, of all people." Naoko laughed and shook her head, "How didn't I think of that? You know, this is so classic of you to undermine me."  
"哦，她只是为了显得友善而友善？也许你是对的。他们派来破坏我的间谍只是想和你做朋友，因为她很友善，她真的对你感兴趣。你，偏偏是你。" 直子笑了笑，摇摇头，"我怎么没想到呢？你知道，你这样贬低我真是太典型了。"

"I thought it was weird too." Asuka finally uttered, "How she kept trying to hang around her. But we didn't know, no one told us that there were-"  
"我也觉得奇怪。" 明日香终于开口道，"她一直试图接近她。但我们不知道，没人告诉我们有——"

"So you were lying to me." The car increased in speed.  
"所以你在对我撒谎。" 车速加快了。

"I-I didn't know they were friends! I swear, I'm gonna make sure they won't be a problem at the con-" Asuka stopped herself.  
"我-我不知道他们是朋友！我发誓，我会确保他们在漫展上不会成为问题——" 明日香突然停住了。

"At what?" Naoko made a sharp turn down the highway. "...Won't be a problem at 'what', Asuka?"  
"在什么地方？" 直子在高速公路上猛地转弯。"...不会成为问题在'什么地方'，明日香？"

"...The classroom?" "...教室？"

"Ritsuko told you about the conference, didn't she?" Naoko asked, and Asuka looked down in response.  
"律子跟你说了那个会议的事，对吧？" 直子问道，而明日香低头回应。

"She didn't tell me anything, I found out on my own."  
"她什么都没告诉我，我是自己发现的。"

Rei tilted her head, "The parent teacher conference?"  
绫波歪了歪头，"家长教师会？"

"It doesn't concern you, Rei." Naoko sighed and eyed Asuka, she remained silent and allowed the girl to stew in her guilt. "I suppose you would've found out eventually. You're a smart girl."  
"这与你无关，丽。" 直子叹了口气，瞥了明日香一眼，她保持沉默，让女孩沉浸在自己的愧疚中。"我想你迟早会发现的。你是个聪明的女孩。"

Asuka uncurled as a hopeful smile came to her eyes, "That's what I said! I mean, about-"  
明日香舒展开来，眼中浮现出希望的微笑，"我就是这么说的！我是说，关于——"

"And you've been working so hard training our little team, and look how you helped Shinji kill his first angel." Naoko noticed Asuka frown, "But let's face it, you practically carried that fight."  
"而且你一直在努力训练我们的小队，看看你是如何帮助真嗣击败他的第一个使徒的。" 直子注意到明日香皱眉，"但让我们面对现实吧，你几乎是在那场战斗中独挑大梁。"

"I know! So where's Ritsuko's head at with bringing in Ikari? I mean, he's not… terrible, but I was telling her, 'mam, if I may-"  
"我知道！那丽子对带入碇有什么想法？我是说，他不是……糟糕，但我跟她说过，‘妈，如果我可以这么说的话——’"

"Of course." "当然可以。"

"If we're competing for our place in the food chain with these guys, we can't play fair, we have to come out swinging!"  
"如果我们和这些家伙争夺食物链的位置，我们就不能公平竞争，必须全力以赴！"

Naoko nodded, "Absolutely. I need my star player." Asuka leaned excitedly, the prior fears evaporated with the praise, as expected. "But I still need to decide who that's gonna be. You did throw a big fit at that fight too."  
直子点头道，“绝对没错。我需要我的明星选手。” 明日香兴奋地倾身，之前的恐惧随着赞扬而烟消云散，正如所料。“但我还需要决定那个人选是谁。你在那场战斗中也确实闹得挺大。”

"R-right. Of course." "好-好的。当然。"

"But, maybe young Shinji still needs more… exposure before he's ready for something like that." Naoko glanced again at Rei and smiled. On their right, a car horn _honked_ beside them. Naoko turned and smiled, "Well, speak of the devil, look who it is!"  
"不过，也许年轻的真嗣还需要更多的……接触，才能准备好面对那样的事情。" 直子再次瞥了一眼绫波，微笑着。在他们右边，一辆车按响了喇叭。直子转过头，微笑道："哎呀，说曹操曹操到，看看是谁来了！"

Misato's blue Alpine had finally caught up with them.  
美里那辆蓝色的阿尔派车终于追上了他们。

Naoko waved excitedly, "Hi!"  
直子兴奋地挥手，"嗨！"

Ritsuko hastily unrolled her passenger-side window and tossed something out the speeding vehicle.  
律子急忙摇下车窗，从疾驰的车中扔出了某样东西。

Misato motioned for the Commander to unroll her windows and did the same for hers, she stuck her head out through the window, "Are we racing or what!?" Misato called out.  
美里示意司令摇下车窗，自己也照做，她把头伸出窗外，"我们是在比赛吗！？"美里喊道。

Naoko let out a shrill laugh, "On a Sunday? Daylight's burning!"  
直子发出尖锐的笑声，“在周日？时间不等人啊！”

"My point exactly!" Misato rolled back her window. The wheels screeched, and the alpine propelled past of the Commander, the smoke obscured their vision as the sun-rays bled through it.  
“我正是这个意思！”美里摇下车窗。车轮尖叫着，阿尔卑斯山脉在指挥官身边疾驰而过，烟雾模糊了他们的视线，阳光穿透其中。

The Commander let out a low chuckle, "Oh, so that's how it is."  
指挥官低声轻笑，“哦，原来如此。”

Naoko shifted the gears on her car, the unsuspecting cyclops pierced through the smoke like a bullet and zoomed ahead of the Alpine within seconds.  
直子换挡加速，那未曾察觉的独眼巨人如子弹般穿透烟雾，几秒钟内便超越了阿尔卑斯山车。

Naoko turned back to look at Misato's passengers, Shinji in particular, "Oh look, Asuka, I think he's waving at you!" Cheerfully, Asuka waved back. "Oh I'm so glad the two of you are getting along again. But not too well I hope."  
直子回头看向美里车上的乘客，尤其是真嗣，“哦，看啊，明日香，我觉得他在向你挥手呢！”明日香愉快地挥手回应。“哦，真高兴你们俩又和好了。不过希望不要太亲密哦。”

Asuka closed her eyes and beamed at the Commander, "Just the right amount."  
明日香闭上眼睛，对着指挥官微笑道，“恰到好处。”

"Attagirl." "好样的。"

---

Asuka's full handed wave dropped down to middle finger, which returned to a wave again as soon as the Commander looked at her. Shinji lowered down his arm and deflated in the backseat.  
明日香的全掌挥手降到了中指，但在司令看向她时又迅速恢复了挥手。真嗣放下手臂，在后座上泄了气。

He immediately regretted that as the hot leather singed his skin, he sat straight with the little room he had, as the older and far taller Fuyutsuki occupied most of the space in the backseat, despite his best efforts. Fuyutsuki had refused to roll up his sleeves and kept his jacket neatly folded over his lap.  
他立刻后悔了，因为热皮革烫伤了他的皮肤，他笔直地坐着，尽管尽了最大努力，但年长且高大的冬月占据了后座的大部分空间。冬月拒绝卷起袖子，将夹克整齐地叠放在膝上。

Misato watched as Asuka disappeared into the smoke trail left behind by Naoko's car. The forest green cyclops zoomed ahead of them and swept her away.  
美里看着明日香消失在直子车后留下的烟尘中。那辆森林绿的独眼巨人疾驰在前，将她卷走了。

"...Guess we're both in the doghouse now." Misato smiled and looked at Shinji through the rear mirror, "Amirite?"  
“……看来我们俩现在都得受罚了。”美里微笑着通过后视镜看向真嗣，“对吧？”

Shinji's brow furrowed, he looked out the window, but the smoke concealed the road ahead.  
真嗣的眉头紧皱，他望向窗外，但烟雾遮蔽了前方的道路。

Misato grunted in displeasure as she sat up for a better view of the highway, she let out a cough "What kind of gas does that thing use?"  
美里不满地哼了一声，坐起身来以便更好地观察高速公路，她咳嗽了一声，“那东西用的是什么气体？”

"Shit." Ritsuko hissed to herself. "Shit!" She turned to Misato for reassurance, "Do you think she saw the cigarette?"  
“该死。”律子低声自语，“该死！”她转向美里寻求安慰，“你觉得她看到那根烟了吗？”

"She definitely won't now-" Misato was cut off as the car jumped suddenly, "Eh?" The Alpine rattled, as though they drove through a field of potholes, "What the hell?" She rolled down her window and looked at the road as they drove. "Are you kidding me!?" Fissure's were lashed all around the surrounding road.  
“她现在肯定看不到了——”美里的话被突然跳起的汽车打断，“诶？”阿尔派恩颠簸着，仿佛他们正驶过一片坑洼地，“搞什么鬼？”她摇下车窗，边开车边看向路面，“你在开玩笑吧！？”裂缝在周围的道路上四处蔓延。

Shinji scanned the road around them, his hand on the car's ceiling. "Wait, I know this place… this is where me and Asuka fought the fourth Angel, why would Ms. Naoko bring us here?"  
真嗣环视四周的道路，手搭在车顶上。“等等，我认得这个地方……这是我跟明日香与第四使徒战斗的地方，为什么直子小姐会把我们带到这里？”

"Odawara? I knew it!" Misato stuck her head out the window, "Some detour!"  
“小田原？我就知道！”美里把头伸出窗外，“绕得够远的！”

"Misato!" Ritsuko hissed, "What if she hears?"  
“美里！”律子低声喝道，“万一她听见了怎么办？”

"Oh whatever, she's way ahead of us!"  
"哎呀随便了，她已经远远领先我们了！"

The car sagged on one side and bounced in a way that sounded very expensive to Shinji's ears.  
车子一侧下沉，弹跳的声音在真嗣听来非常昂贵。

Misato ducked her head back into the car and gripped the steering wheel. "And I just got my alignment all done, great. That's just great. Now I gotta take it to the-" Misato punched the wheel. "-Goddamn. Mother-fucking shop!"  
美里把头缩回车内，紧握方向盘。“我刚做完四轮定位，太好了。真是太好了。现在我得把它开到——”美里捶了一下方向盘。“——该死的。妈的修车店！”

"Misato, get a grip, look at yourself."  
"美里，振作点，看看你自己。"

"No, you look! You still worry about your mom catching you smoking!"  
"不，你才该看看！你还担心你妈妈抓到你抽烟呢！"

Fuyutsuki leaned in between the catfight. "Let's all relax here. Everybody is under a lot of stress today, and I am sure this weather hasn't been helping."  
冬月插进这场争吵中，靠近说道：“大家都放松些吧。今天每个人压力都很大，我相信这天气也没帮上忙。”

"Y-yeah." Shinji chuckled, "The heat is just getting to us, that's all."  
“嗯，嗯。”真嗣轻笑道，“只是这热浪让我们有点受不了，仅此而已。”

The two glanced back at their backseat passengers. They looked back at each other. Misato sighed, "You're right, I'm- I don't know what came over me. You're right, this heat is just getting to me. I'm… uh, I shouldn't have said that to you?"  
两人回头看了看后座的乘客。他们彼此对视了一眼。美里叹了口气，“你说得对，我——我不知道自己怎么了。你说得对，这热浪确实让我有点失控。我……呃，我不该对你说那些话的？”

Ritsuko clicked her tongue, "Still can't say sorry."  
律子咂了咂舌，“还是说不出对不起。”

"It's just-" Misato gestured to the treacherous road that the Commander led them on, which Naoko swerved and swayed around with ease, "Why hasn't this been fixed yet? It's been over a month, where's all that UN money even going?"  
"只是——" 美里指向指挥官带领他们走的那条崎岖不平的路，直子却轻松自如地绕过弯道，"为什么这条路还没修好？已经过去一个多月了，那些联合国拨款都用到哪儿去了？"

"Preaching to the choir." Fuyutsuki replied.  
"对牛弹琴。" 冬月回答道。"

Ritsuko turned to her, "Do you even know how much operational upkeep of an EVA costs daily, not to mention repairs?"  
律子转向她，"你知不知道一台 EVA 每天的运营维护费用是多少，更别提修理了？"

"A lot." Misato replied. "很多。" 美里回答道。

Ritsuko continued. "Don't even get me started on the deal we're making with the JSSDF to loan out their positron rifle to us. Or increasing battery times. You have no idea."  
律子继续说道。"别提我们和自卫队达成的协议，借用他们的阳电子步枪给我们。还有延长电池续航时间。你根本想象不到。"

"Actually, I do know-" "实际上，我确实知道——"

"-Now add running a city to that-"  
"-现在再加上管理一座城市呢-"

"-I know because you deliver me the quotes everyday. I'm the Operations Director." Misato jabbed a thumb at herself, then pointed at Ritsuko, her eyes still glued on the highway to hell. "You're the operations assistant. Assistant."  
"-我知道，因为你每天给我送来这些引语。我是运营总监。" 美里用拇指指了指自己，然后指向律子，眼睛依旧盯着通往地狱的高速公路。"你是运营助理。助理。"

Ritsuko pulled something out of her pocket, two torn pieces of paper. "I never questioned that. All I'm saying is Mother has a lot on her plate with-" She lifted her head up to see Shinji watch their conversation through the rearview mirror. She hid her face behind the brim of her hat. "-You know. Also, I'm the assistant head scientist as well."  
律子从口袋里掏出两张撕破的纸片。"我从没质疑过这一点。我只是在说，母亲她有很多事情要处理，比如——" 她抬起头，看到真嗣通过后视镜观察她们的对话。她把脸藏在帽檐下。"——你知道的。另外，我还是助理首席科学家。"

Shinji leaned in between the two, "Is that why we're having a meeting, because something's happening?"  
真嗣侧身挤在两人之间，“这就是我们开会的理由吗？因为有什么事情要发生？”

Misato side-eyed Ritsuko, "And you don't think two full time jobs is a lot on your plate?"  
美里斜眼瞥了瞥律子，“你不觉得同时做两份全职工作压力很大吗？”

"I don't mind." “我不在乎。”

Shinji blinked, "D-did you guys hear what I said?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼，“我……你们听到我说的话了吗？”

"I can't believe what I'm hearing." Misato looked up at the rearview mirror where Shinji waited expectantly for a response, "You know what's crazy Shinji? Ritsuko used to be the coolest chick in college."  
“我简直不敢相信自己的耳朵。”美里抬头看向后视镜，真嗣正期待地等待着回应，“你知道什么很疯狂吗，真嗣？律子在大学时可是最酷的女生。”

Ritsuko covered her face, "Oh god, not this again…"  
律子捂住脸，“哦天哪，别再提这个了……”

Misato leaned back and drove with one hand, "I'm serious. Total prodigy. Top grades in all our classes, took shit from no one, you had all these crazy ideas. I thought you'd be running a NERV branch up in the states with me at this point."  
美里向后靠了靠，单手驾驶着车，"我可是认真的。绝对的奇才。所有课程都是顶尖成绩，从不忍受任何人的欺负，你总是有这些疯狂的想法。我以为你现在会和我一起在美国管理 NERV 分部呢。"

"And you were a mute for two years, what does it even matter? I barely even remember those days, don't even remind me. I'd just rather focus on my work. And anyway, somebody had to stay behind to look after Asuka-"  
"而且你沉默了两年，这有什么关系呢？我几乎都不记得那些日子了，别再提醒我了。我宁愿专注于我的工作。而且无论如何，总得有人留下来照顾明日香——"

"-Right, and the hair!" Misato nodded at Shinji, "She used to bleach her hair, I know you kids do it all the time, but back in the day? Took a lot of guts." Misato glanced at Fuyutsuki, who looked out his window "Right, old timer? Hair dye was crazy back in the day."  
"——对，还有头发！"美里向真嗣点头示意，"她以前会把头发漂白，我知道你们年轻人经常这么做，但在那时候？需要很大的勇气。"美里瞥了一眼冬月，他正望着窗外，"对吧，老前辈？那时候染发可是很疯狂的。"

"Hm."

"It looked ridiculous and you know it." Ritsuko pressed her hat down to completely cover her dull burgundy hair. "No one would've taken me seriously at a real job."  
"看起来很滑稽，你自己也知道。" 律子压低帽子，完全遮住了她那暗红色的头发。"在正式的工作场合，没人会把我当回事。"

"I've seen a few of the technicians at headquarters with it, and Rei has it too, right?" Shinji offered.  
"我在总部见过几个技术人员也有这种发色，丽也是，对吧？" 真嗣说道。"

Ritsuko attempted to turn to face Shinji, but the brim of her sunhat was too wide. "That's not hair dye, Shinji. Rei has a melanin deficiency."  
律子试图转身面对真嗣，但她的宽边太阳帽阻碍了动作。"那不是染发，真嗣。丽是黑色素缺乏。"

Misato tilted her head. "Oh, like an albino?"  
美里歪了歪头。“哦，像白化病那样吗？”

"No Misato, she's a…hm. I don't know what the exact term is. Mother told me a long time ago."  
“不是的，美里，她是……嗯。我不记得确切的词了。很久以前妈妈告诉过我。”

Shinji nodded, "Oh, okay. Well, anyways, I was asking earlier-"  
真嗣点点头，“哦，好吧。总之，我之前在问——”

"Well, what about that radio-op, Midori?" Misato offered. "She's got pink hair."  
"那么，那个电台操作员，绿怎么样？她有粉红色的头发。"

"...I'm getting really tired of being kept in the dark." Shinji said boldly.  
""...我真的很厌倦被蒙在鼓里。"" 真嗣大胆地说道。

"My point exactly. Everybody thinks Midori looks like a clown."  
"我正是这个意思。大家都觉得绿看起来像个马戏团小丑。"

Shinji slumped onto the singing leather seats, the sensation was a welcome distraction from the migraine that contorted in his temple.  
真嗣瘫坐在吱吱作响的皮椅上，这种感觉成了他太阳穴处扭曲的偏头痛的一剂受欢迎的缓解剂。

He felt Fuyutsuki stare at him with the corner of his eyes. His right hand held up his head and covered his mouth, as though he hid a guilty expression. When Shinji turned to engage Fuyutsuki, the old man's gaze had retreated to the road.  
他感觉到副司令用眼角余光盯着他。他的右手托着头，遮住了嘴巴，仿佛在隐藏一个内疚的表情。当真嗣转头想要与副司令交流时，老人的目光已经回到了前方道路上。

Kyoko patiently stood alone inside the NERV conference room, the massive monitor behind her blared a neutral white light.  
绫子耐心地独自站在 NERV 会议室里，她身后巨大的显示屏散发着中性的白光。

The cool, conditioned halls of the Geofront provided a hollow sanctuary from the fever of the outside world. The intense heat that all of the crew complained about was not present in these metallic walls. Not that she would have known the difference either way.  
地底都市的凉爽空调走廊为外界的热浪提供了一处空洞的避难所。船员们抱怨的酷热并未侵袭这些金属墙壁。无论怎样，她对此并无感知。

She unglued her eyes from her watch. Footsteps, many footsteps approached the doorway. She glanced at the observation window, and the sight of red hair among the crowd shot a crack through her collected demeanour as her mind played tricks on her. She suddenly felt the cool air sting her neck. Her heart contorted as she gasped for air and stopped herself from leaning on the desk.  
她从手表上移开视线。脚步声，许多脚步声正接近门口。她瞥向观察窗，人群中一抹红发的身影让她的镇定瞬间破裂，脑海中幻象丛生。她突然感到冷风刺痛了她的脖颈。心脏紧缩，她急促呼吸，强忍着不倚靠在桌子上。

The two of them locked eyes through the door's fogged glass panel. Her mind's eye held back an image that demanded to be seen. Small feet suspended in the air, hanging from a light fixture.  
透过门上雾蒙蒙的玻璃板，两人目光交汇。她内心深处的眼睛压抑着一幅迫切想要看到的画面。小小的双脚悬在空中，挂在灯具上。

Kyoko shut her eyes. "That is not her. It is not her. It is only…"  
京子闭上了眼睛。“那不是她。不是她。那只是……”

The doors slid open as the group entered. Kyoko opened her eyes, she locked them with- "...Langley. Commander. I have been waiting."  
随着众人进入，门滑开了。京子睁开眼睛，与对方对视——“……兰利。指挥官。我一直在等您。”

Langley avoided Kyoko's gaze and hugged her arms. Naoko pushed through, "I hope not for too long!"  
兰利避开了响子的目光，抱紧了自己的双臂。直子挤了过来，"我希望不会太久！"

"Thirty-five minutes to be exact. I was told time is precious."  
"确切地说，三十五分钟。我被告知时间很宝贵。"

"Yes, so sorry, I had to make a little detour." Naoko walked up to Kyoko and smiled, "Why don't you let me take it from here?"  
"是的，很抱歉，我不得不绕了点路。"直子走到响子面前微笑道，"不如让我来接手吧？"

Kyoko blinked, she bit back the instinct to protest and nodded, "Yes, Commander." She walked towards the seating area where a walkway divided two sections. Everyone had made themselves comfortable on either end.  
绫波眨了眨眼，她忍住了抗议的本能，点了点头，“是的，指挥官。”她走向座位区，那里一条走道将两个部分隔开。每个人都已经在两端各自找好了舒适的位置。

Langley sat at the very front of the left section, her normally proud posture deflated as the two avoided eye contact. Katsuragi sat at the row behind her, arms crossed as she glared daggers at Kyoko. Akagi's daughter sat beside her and winced apologetically.  
兰利坐在左侧区域的最前面，她平时骄傲的姿态此刻显得有些萎靡，两人都避免眼神接触。葛城坐在她后面一排，双臂交叉，对绫波投以锐利的目光。赤木律子的女儿坐在她旁边，抱歉地皱了皱眉。

She turned to the right section of the seats, Fuyutsuki seemed to be miles away…and sat next to him was the younger Ikari. He too avoided her gaze. Clearly, the boy had heard plenty of gossip from Katsuragi.  
她转向右侧的座位，冬月似乎心不在焉……而他旁边坐着的是年轻的碇真嗣。他也避开了她的目光。显然，这男孩从葛城那里听到了不少闲言碎语。

In the furthest seat from everybody, in the far right was the latest in the Ayanami series.  
在最远离众人的位置，右边的角落里坐着最新一代的绫波系列。

Kyoko opted to sit in the far left corner.  
Kyoko 选择坐在最左边的角落。

Naoko moved aside all of Kyoko's notes, the table now bare, everyone in the room waited patiently for her to speak.  
Naoko 挪开了 Kyoko 所有的笔记，桌子现在空无一物，房间里的每个人都耐心等待着她发言。

"It just… shocks me. It shocks me that I have such an incredible team alongside me. Just look at you. Thank you all so much for being a part of our little family. Really, I couldn't do it all without you. You all deserve a pat on the back." Naoko nodded to the assembly. "Go on."  
"这真是……让我震惊。我震惊于自己身边有这样一支不可思议的团队。看看你们。非常感谢大家成为我们这个小家庭的一部分。真的，没有你们，我无法做到这一切。你们每个人都值得被表扬。" 直子向众人点头示意。"继续吧。"

After the group exchanged some confused glances, they all hesitantly patted themselves on the back.  
在大家交换了一些困惑的眼神后，他们都犹豫地拍了拍自己的背。

Naoko let out a satisfied hum. "Now that that's out of the way, you might notice there are some orientation packages on top of your desks, that's to help you follow along. Be sure to thank Kyoko for that, she was up all morning making them!"  
直子发出满意的哼声。"既然这件事已经过去了，你们可能会注意到桌上有一些迎新资料，那是帮助你们跟上进度的。一定要感谢京子，她整个早上都在忙着准备这些！"

Everyone stared quietly at her.  
所有人都静静地盯着她。

"Well then, there's a lot of ground to cover today. so please don't hesitate to raise your hand if there's any questions."  
“那么，今天我们有很多内容要讨论。如果有任何问题，请随时举手提问。”

The Commander reached for a remote and clicked it, then the empty white background changed to a blueprint of EVA sized weaponry. "First off, I am _so_ proud to show you all what Kyoko and the engineers have been working on over on R & D!"  
指挥官伸手拿起遥控器按了一下，随后空白的白色背景变成了一张 EVA 尺寸武器的蓝图。“首先，我非常自豪地向大家展示 Kyoko 和研发部门的工程师们一直在研究的项目！”

Misato discreetly leaned over to Ritsuko, who despite being right beside her, was miles away and whispered so the Commander wouldn't hear. "Do you really think we have time for this? We have to be in old Tokyo in less than four hours."  
美里谨慎地向身边的律子靠了靠，尽管律子就在她旁边，却仿佛远在天边，她低声说道，以免被司令听到。“你真的认为我们有时间做这个吗？我们必须在四小时内到达旧东京。”

"I didn't see a hand, Misato." Naoko said. "Page five please." She notes a raised hand, "Yes, Shinji?"  
“我没看到有人举手，美里。”直子说道。“请翻到第五页。”她注意到一只举起的手，“是的，真嗣？”

"Is that a shot-gun?" “那是霰弹枪吗？”

"No Shinji. It's a grenade launcher. See Misato? That's how it's done."  
“不是的，真嗣。这是榴弹发射器。看，美里，这才是正确的操作方式。”

Ritsuko rested her fist on her chin, "I made that blueprint…"  
律子将拳头抵在下巴上，“那张蓝图是我设计的……”

---

Shinji blinked in and out of consciousness as slide after slide came and went before he could even register what was on the screen.  
真嗣的意识时断时续，幻灯片一张接一张地放映，他甚至来不及看清屏幕上的内容。

"Oh, now _this_ one I am very excited for you all to see, hope you're keeping up!"  
"哦，这个我真的很期待你们能看到，希望你们跟得上！"

He hastily flipped through the orientation package, and none of the pages seemed to match Despite the air conditioning, Shinji began to sweat. He glanced at Fuyutsuki, who was still on page five, a homemade sudoku board drawn on the blank part of the page. He turned to Asuka where an idea popped in his head. Shinji pulled out his new phone that he hardly understood how to operate and stealthily texted her.  
他匆忙翻阅着迎新手册，但似乎没有一页是对的。尽管开着空调，真嗣开始冒汗。他瞥了一眼冬月，他还在第五页，空白处画着自制的数独棋盘。他转向明日香，脑海中闪过一个主意。真嗣掏出他几乎不懂怎么操作的新手机，偷偷给她发了条短信。

_Hey Asuka, can you please tell me what page we are on? :)  
嘿，明日香，你能告诉我我们现在在哪一页吗？ :)_

He snuck a glance at Asuka's side of the room, where she responded with almost lighting speed. Shinji looked back down at his phone half a minute later to realize she was still typing and titled his head in confusion. Then his phone vibrated.  
他偷偷瞥了一眼明日香那边，只见她以近乎闪电般的速度回应。半分钟后，真嗣再次低头看向手机，发现她仍在打字，便困惑地歪了歪头。接着，他的手机震动了。

…./´¯/)

…./…./

…./'/…/…./…./¨¯\

…\…..'…../

…\…..(  
…..\….\…

Shinji let out a sigh of defeat.  
真嗣发出了一声失败的叹息。

Naoko cleared her throat. "Asuka, are you paying attention?"  
直子清了清嗓子。“明日香，你在听吗？”

"Yes, mam-" She looked up to the display monitor and froze at the sight of the image.  
“是的，女士——”她抬头望向显示屏，看到图像时顿时僵住了。

"Oh, that caught your eye, did it?" Naoko looked back at the screen with a proud smirk. The Commander blocked the center part of the screen for Asuka. Behind her, two large mechanical wings sprouted on either side.  
“哦，那东西吸引了你的目光，是吗？”直子回头看着屏幕，带着得意的微笑。司令挡住了屏幕中央的部分，不让明日香看到。在她身后，两侧各展开了一对巨大的机械翅膀。

The Commander walked away from the line of sight and revealed a white and silver stand-in Evangelion at the center of the image.  
司令从视线中走开，露出图像中央一架白色和银色的备用福音战士。

Asuka studied the EVA and her eyes widened as images of her night terror manifested itself within the outlines of the prototype's elongated, skeletal jaw.  
明日香仔细观察着 EVA，当她夜间的恐怖幻象在原型机那拉长、骨架般的下颚轮廓中显现时，她的眼睛不禁睁大了。

"It's a support unit. A propulsion guided harness that can be connected to the power cable's outlet seamlessly. I call it: The UX-9 Aeronautica." Naoko let out a giggle, "It's going to change the game."  
“这是一款辅助单元。一种推进引导背带，可以无缝连接到电源电缆的插座上。我称之为：UX-9 航空器。”直子发出一阵轻笑，“这将改变游戏规则。”

Misato raised an eyebrow, "This is my first time hearing about it."  
美里挑了挑眉，“这是我第一次听说这件事。”

"Well, have you been reading all your memos?" Naoko said.  
"嗯，你把所有的备忘录都看过了吗？" 直子问道。

"Of course." "当然。"

Naoko smiled, "Then you'll know to be sure to thank Dr. Soryu for the cutting edge design."  
直子微笑着说，"那你一定知道要好好感谢苍龙博士的尖端设计了。"

"It's sort of like a… jetpack with wings?" Shinji offered.  
"有点像带翅膀的喷气背包？" 真嗣提议道。

The Commander nodded, "You could say that. I know it looks rather crude right now, but when is it in its final stage? They'll be about as light and delicate as feathers."  
司令点点头，"你可以这么说。我知道它现在看起来相当粗糙，但最终阶段会是什么样子？它们会像羽毛一样轻盈而精致。"

Asuka gulped, "Why… why would we even need that?"  
明日香咽了咽口水，"为什么……我们为什么需要那个？"

Shinji turned her way, "Maybe there will be flying Angels one day, and we have to fight in the sky?"  
真嗣转向她，“也许有一天会有会飞的天使，我们得在空中战斗？”

"An interesting possibility, Shinji." Naoko offered, "But think bigger than Angels."  
“一个有趣的设想，真嗣。”直子提议道，“但想想比天使更大的东西。”

Shinji rubbed his chin, and then tented his hands without knowing.  
真嗣揉了揉下巴，然后不自觉地双手合十。

Asuka took the opportunity and hurryingly raised her hand up while Shinji thought aimlessly about what could be bigger than Angels.  
明日香抓住机会，急忙举起手来，而真嗣则茫然地思考着还有什么能比使徒更强大的存在。

"Yes?" "是的？"

"What seems more likely, Commander, is that we are going to be taking fights outside of the home base. Something smaller, but we shouldn't underestimate them."  
“指挥官，更可能的情况是，我们将不得不在基地外进行战斗。虽然规模较小，但我们绝不能低估它们。”

Shinji considered for a moment, "I guess the Angels usually do come to us, maybe if we can find out where they're coming from… less people will be hurt?"  
真嗣沉思片刻，“我想使徒通常都是来找我们的，也许如果我们能找出它们的来源地……就能减少人们的伤亡？”

Naoko weighed between her two pupils back and forth, until she smiled at Asuka. "An interesting possibility Shinji, but wouldn't it be better to beat the enemy to the punch?"  
直子在两个学生之间来回权衡，最终对明日香微笑道：“真嗣，这主意挺有意思，但先发制敌不是更好吗？”

"I guess if it's bigger than an Angel, it would be better to take the fight away from the city. Is it a… devil? There's ah- there's no messing around if it's a devil. I'll do whatever you guys think is best."  
“我想，如果比使徒还大，最好把战场移出城市。是……恶魔吗？如果是恶魔，那可不能掉以轻心。我会按照你们的决定行事。”

The Commander hid her disappointment with an amused chuckle, "But that sentiment has its merit, yes." She looked down for a moment, "Shinji, do you know anything about the possibility of another organization that would attempt to overthrow NERV and disband the Evangelion program?" Naoko looked at Shinji intensely.  
司令官用一声轻笑掩饰失望，“不过，这想法确实有其价值。”她低头片刻，“真嗣，你了解过可能存在的另一个试图推翻 NERV、解散 EVA 计划的组织吗？”直子紧盯着真嗣。

Shinji stared blankly at Naoko and stammered, "Uh, not really? Wait, I thought we were with the UN? Is there something going on?"  
真嗣茫然地盯着直子，结结巴巴地说：“呃，不太清楚？等等，我以为我们是在联合国旗下？有什么事情发生吗？”

"Asuka?" Naoko called out, and her pupil stood up to attention.  
“明日香？”直子喊道，她的学生立刻站直了身子。

"D-does that mean I'd lose my insurance?" Shinji stammered out.  
“那、那是不是意味着我会失去保险？”真嗣结巴着问道。

Fuyutsuki tapped his shoulder as though he were Shinji's legal aid, "It won't come to that."  
冬月轻拍他的肩膀，仿佛他是真嗣的辩护律师，“不会到那一步的。”

"The same question, Asuka." The Commander repeated.  
“同样的问题，明日香。”指挥官重复道。

Asuka's posture stiffened, as though she were a soldier giving orders. Shinji turned his head towards her mother, the Chief Scientist, and their demeanors were identical.  
明日香的姿态变得僵硬，宛如一名下达命令的士兵。真嗣转头看向她的母亲，首席科学家，两人的举止如出一辙。

"Yes, Commander. During breakfast today I found reports of two assets being built by ACE chemicals. Corporations outsourced by the Strategic Self Defence Force. They are to be showcased at a Conference located on the outskirts of Tokyo-01 and as you suggested, I suspect they intend to overthrow NERV."  
"是的，指挥官。今天早餐时，我发现 ACE 化学公司正在建造两处资产的报告。这些公司是由战略自卫队外包的。它们将在东京-01 郊外的一个会议上展出，正如您所建议的，我怀疑他们打算推翻 NERV。"

"And these reports were… confidential?" Naoko shot a glance at Ritsuko, who hesitated.  
"而这些报告是……机密的吗？" 直子瞥了一眼律子，后者犹豫了一下。

Her daughter nodded, "That's right, I can confirm what she said is true, and I take full-responsibility."  
她的女儿点头道："没错，我可以确认她所说的是真的，并且我愿意承担全部责任。"

Naoko smiled at Ritsuko, "Thank you for your honesty." She turned to Misato whose arms were crossed, "And thank you for your discretion."  
直子对律子微笑道，“谢谢你的坦诚。”她转向双臂交叉的美里，“也谢谢你的谨慎。”

"I told Shinji too." Misato bluffed.  
“我也告诉过真嗣了。”美里虚张声势地说。

"No you didn't-" Shinji could feel Misato's laser eyes from across the room and stammered, "-Didn't, didn't tell me… there were two assets being built?"  
“不，你没有——”真嗣能感觉到美里如激光般的目光从房间另一头射来，结巴地说，“没，没告诉我……有两个资产正在建造？”

Naoko raised her eyebrow, "Oh, she did?" She clicked for the next slide, "She showed you these?"  
直子挑了挑眉，“哦，她真的这么做了？”她点击下一张幻灯片，“她给你看了这些？”

Two massive mechas blared on the screen and flooded the blue meeting room with flashes of orange. On either side were comparisons of Evangelion Unit-01 to scale, and both were nearly double their height.  
两台巨大的机甲在屏幕上轰鸣，橙色的闪光淹没了蓝色的会议室。两侧是与福音战士初号机按比例对比的图像，两者的高度几乎都是初号机的两倍。

The Commander pointed to the more humanoid looking one, with orange armor, lanky springy limbs and black quills protruded from its back. "Did Misato show you this one, Shinji?"  
司令官指向那个看起来更像人形的机甲，它身披橙色装甲，四肢修长而富有弹性，背部突出黑色的尖刺。“美里给你看过这个吗，真嗣？”

He nodded in response. "Yes, I know all about them."  
他点头回应。“是的，我了解他们的一切。”

Naoko covered the title underneath the mecha with her hand. "What's the name?"  
直子用手遮住了机甲下的标题。“这叫什么名字？”

Shinji tucked in his white shirt as he stood up and stated with the utmost confidence: "The Hedgehogotron 5000."  
真嗣整理好他的白衬衫，站起身来，带着无比的自信说道：“刺猬战神 5000。”

Naoko moved her hand and the text simply said, "_Jet Alone"._  
直子移动了她的手，屏幕上简单地显示着：“Jet Alone”。

Asuka suppressed the faintest of snickers. She bit back the rare laugh and froze when she felt Naoko's eyes shine widely at her.  
明日香强忍住几乎察觉不到的窃笑。她咬紧牙关，抑制住这难得的笑声，当她感觉到直子眼睛闪闪发亮地盯着她时，她僵住了。

"Oh. Misato, I coulda sworn you said the Hedgehogotron-"  
“哦，美里，我敢肯定你刚才说的是刺猬哈里——”

Misato groaned, "Shinji, sit down."  
美里呻吟道：“真嗣，坐下。”

"Commander, he is clearly attempting to cover for Langley and your daughter." Kyoko declared from the back of the conference room.  
“司令，他显然是在为兰格雷和您的女儿打掩护。”响子在会议室后方宣布。

"I know, Kyoko, thank you."  
“我知道，响子，谢谢你。”

Ritsuko leaned closer to expect the details of the two mechas, and the dates they were printed with. "These designs are more up to date than what we have, and more advanced…"  
律子凑近了些，期待着了解这两台机甲的详细信息以及它们的制造日期。“这些设计比我们现有的要新，而且更先进……”

"Which means that our provider has been feeding us irrelevant intel…" Kyoko added.  
“这意味着我们的供应商一直在向我们提供无关紧要的情报……”京子补充道。

Naoko began to pace side to side, "You see why I told you two not to tell the kids? Who knows who or what we can even trust right now. Not to mention…" The Commander clicked on the next slide, three resembling faces appeared on the screen, but not in the standard uniform you would wear for a school picture. The three all wore camo and posed for what appeared to be mug-shots, "Some of your friends aren't who they appeared to be."  
直子开始来回踱步，“你们明白我为什么告诉你们不要告诉孩子们了吧？现在谁知道我们还能信任谁或什么。更不用说……”指挥官点击了下一张幻灯片，屏幕上出现了三张相似的面孔，但并非穿着学校照片的标准制服。这三人都身着迷彩服，摆出像是嫌疑犯照片的姿势，“你们的一些朋友并不像他们表现出来的那样。”

"The MARDUK institute has been bought out- there are infiltrators within class 2-A, rogue pilots." Kyoko said.  
“MARDUK 研究所已被收购——2-A 班内有渗透者，还有叛变的飞行员。”响子说道。

"Yes, I was getting to that." Naoko turned back to the children, "Jet Alone may be controlled by an on-board computer but make no mistake, the Trident Land Cruiser is piloted by three children in your class."  
“是的，我正要说这个。”直子转向孩子们，“Jet Alone 或许是由机载电脑控制的，但请记住，三叉戟陆地巡洋舰是由你们班上的三个孩子驾驶的。”

Shinji gasped at the sight of Keita Asari and his sunken, dull eyed expression.  
真嗣看到浅利咲太那凹陷、无神的双眼，不禁倒吸了一口气。

Asuka squinted at the grinning, purple haired boy in the bottom of the lineup, he stuck his tongue out and struck a pose for his mugshot. "Augh, gross, it's that weird german kid who tried to hit on me!" She turned to see if she elicited a reaction from Shinji, but he was still transfixed at the sight of that short weirdo that hangs out with him and the stooges all the time. She crossed her arms and let out a sizzled grunt. "I didn't tell him a thing, Commander."  
明日香眯眼打量着队列末端那个咧嘴笑、紫发的小子，他伸出舌头，摆了个姿势拍大头照。“啊，真恶心，就是那个试图搭讪我的奇怪德国小子！”她转头看向真嗣，想看看他有没有反应，但他依旧盯着那个总是和他那帮跟班混在一起的矮小怪人。她双臂交叉，发出一声不悦的哼声。“我什么都没告诉他，司令。”

"I know." "我知道。"

Rei stared silently at Mana Kirishima's mugshot. Kirishima's eyes were sharp as steel, and the faint smirk was anticipation of weakness, not the warmth and innocent curiosity that Rei had seen this morning. The warmth quickly faded and left a cold spot in her stomach, which quickly travelled to her skull where she felt a burning sensation like never before. Her fists tightened reflexively.  
绫波零静静地凝视着来栖摩央的照片。摩央的眼神锐利如钢，那淡淡的冷笑预示着对方的弱点，而非今早她所见的那份温暖与纯真的好奇。那份温暖迅速消散，在她胃里留下一片冰冷，随即直冲头顶，让她感到前所未有的灼热感。她的拳头不由自主地握紧了。

"I imagine you all feel shocked, confused, maybe even a little betrayed." Naoko offered.  
“我想你们都感到震惊、困惑，甚至可能有点被背叛的感觉。”直子说道。

Shinji looked down and frowned, "I thought Keita was my friend."  
真嗣低头皱眉，“我以为圭太是我的朋友。”

Misato turned to him, "Shinji, did you tell him anything?"  
美里转向他，“真嗣，你告诉他什么了吗？”

"No, I thought it was strange how he would ask so many questions, but this doesn't make any sense. He's so… quiet and normal. He wouldn't hurt anybody."  
“没有，我只是觉得他问那么多问题很奇怪，但这完全说不通。他那么……安静又正常。他不会伤害任何人的。”

"Don't underestimate him, Shinji." Naoko warned, "Keita Asari's family had their hands in the Japanese military since before the Second Great War."  
"别小看他，真嗣。" 直子警告道，"浅利圭太的家族早在第二次世界大战之前就在日本军方有深厚背景。"

Asuka snorted and leaned back in her chair. "Please, the guy is a lump of soy sauce."  
明日香哼了一声，靠回椅背上。"拜托，那家伙就是个酱油瓶。"

"Naoko, what should we do?" Shinji asked.  
"直子，我们该怎么办？" 真嗣问道。"

"For now, nothing. The three of you will carry on with any social interactions you have with our guests as if this conversation never happened."  
"目前来说，什么也不做。你们三人继续与我们的客人进行任何社交互动，就好像这次对话从未发生过一样。"

"Commander-" Misato got no response so she sighed and raised her hand, "We should evict these Trident Pilots from the city immediately after the conference has ended."  
"指挥官——" 美里没有得到回应，于是她叹了口气，举起手，"会议结束后，我们应该立即驱逐这些三叉戟飞行员离开城市。"

Naoko waved a dismissive hand, "That won't be necessary, besides, Keita Asari's father is one of the highest authorities in the JSSDF, he's practically their Commander. So I don't want any unnecessary tension at the conference today. To all of our sponsors this is merely a friendly forum to best decide where the world's resources will go. For Humanity's best interest of course."  
直子不以为然地挥了挥手，"那没有必要，而且，浅利惠太的父亲是日本自卫队中最高级别的官员之一，他几乎就是他们的指挥官。所以我不想在今天的会议上引起任何不必要的紧张。对我们所有的赞助商来说，这只是一个友好论坛，以最佳决定世界资源的分配。当然，这是为了人类的最高利益。"

"The tightrope of diplomacy…" Fuyutsuki muttered to himself.  
"外交的钢丝…" 副校长富津津自言自语道。

Misato rested her head on her desk table, "I hate politics." She said quietly. "Why can't we just do our job in peace?"  
美里将头靠在桌子上，"我讨厌政治。" 她轻声说道，"为什么我们不能安安静静地完成我们的工作呢？"

"Because as always, whenever a new big fish is in town, the rest of the pod would rather flap their fins and worry about their little breadcrumbs, rather than unite the school."  
"因为一如既往，每当城里来了新的大鱼，其他鱼群宁愿摆动鳍片，担心它们那点面包屑，也不愿团结整个鱼群。"

"So they're trying to upstage us?" Shinji asked.  
"所以他们想抢我们的风头？" 真嗣问道。

And Naoko nodded. "If it's a show they want, then we're going to give them a show they will never forget."  
直子点了点头。"如果他们想要一场表演，那我们就给他们一场他们永生难忘的表演。"

"A show? What kind of show?"  
"表演？什么样的表演？"

The Commander stared evenly at Shinji, "What do you think we should do?"  
指挥官平静地盯着真嗣，“你觉得我们应该怎么做？”

"S-speak from the heart?"  
“从……从心而论？”

"...Asuka?" "...明日香？"

Asuka shot to attention, "Use whatever trick in the book we have to, Commander." Naoko smiled in approval of Asuka's answer, and a swell of joy rushed through her. Asuka smirked smugly at Shinji.  
明日香立刻正色道，“用尽我们手头所有的手段，指挥官。”直子对明日香的回答报以微笑，表示赞许，一股喜悦涌上她的心头。明日香得意地对真嗣扬了扬眉。

"If this conference doesn't help us turn the UN in our favor, everything we have will be taken from us, everything. And then who will defend humanity when the angels seek what's hidden below this city? Who will defend humanity from Third Impact? These three brats?"  
"如果这次会议不能帮我们扭转联合国对我们的看法，我们将失去一切，一切。那么，当天使们寻找这座城市地下的秘密时，谁来保护人类？谁来防止第三次冲击？就凭这三个孩子？"

"Wait.." Shinji raised his hand, "Third Impact?"  
"等等……" 真嗣举起手，"第三次冲击？"

"Oh." The Commander said softly. "Nobody told you?"  
"哦。" 指挥官轻声说道，"没人告诉过你吗？"

"Nobody tells me anything around here, I mean-"  
"这里没人告诉我任何事，我是说——"

"-Then it's time for you to know Shinji, like we all do." Naoko approached his table, the white light of the screen blinded him. "The public believes a meteor caused the Second Impact, but the truth is…Angels, Shinji. They caused the Second Impact."  
"——那么是时候让你知道了，真嗣，就像我们所有人一样。" 直子走近他的桌子，屏幕的白色光芒让他目眩。"公众相信是陨石导致了第二次冲击，但真相是……使徒，真嗣。它们引发了第二次冲击。"

"R-really?" "真、真的吗？"

The Commander nodded. "And if one of them pierces the Tokyo-03's Geofront and reaches the depths of Terminal Dogma, it _will_ happen again. Humanity will not be prepared, it will be the end."  
指挥官点头道：“如果其中之一穿透了东京-03 的 Geofront 并抵达 Terminal Dogma 的深处，那将会再次发生。人类将无法准备，那将是末日。”

"Oh man…" “哦，天哪……”

Naoko nodded sympathetically, "I'm sure that's a lot to process for you."  
直子同情地点头，“对你来说，这肯定很难消化。”

"But I don't understand, if that much is at stake," Shinji pointed to the two mechas, "Why can't the others be sent here to help us? Why must it only be one group or the other? "  
"但我不明白，既然事情如此重大，" 真嗣指向两台机甲，"为什么不能派其他人来帮助我们？为什么必须只能是一组或另一组？"

"You'll be surprised with what people will do to have things go their way."  
"你会惊讶于人们为了事情按自己的方式发展会做出什么。"

"But-" “但是——”

"-But?" "-但是？"

Shinji stood up, "I may not have known about Keita, but I know he's not a bad guy, maybe he could talk to his father-"  
真嗣站起身来，“我可能之前不了解圭太，但我知道他不是坏人，也许他可以和他父亲谈谈——”

"General Asari is not somebody you reason with easily." Fuyutsuki explained to Shinji, "Whenever an exchange is made, he expects something in return. And it is nearly impossible to persuade him of anything."  
“浅利将军不是那么容易讲道理的人。”冬月向真嗣解释道，“每次交易，他都期待有所回报。而且几乎不可能说服他接受任何事情。”

"Oh…"

Naoko sighed, "Abe is a dear friend of mine, but Kozo is right, he is very persistent." She turned to Misato, "He was the one who funded your father's expedition to Antarctica, they were good friends."  
直子叹了口气，“阿部是我亲爱的朋友，但高雄说得对，他非常执着。”她转向美里，“他就是资助你父亲南极探险的那个人，他们曾是好朋友。”

Misato scowled. "I remember."  
美里皱起眉头。“我记得。”

Shinji looked at the two confusingly, "Misato?"  
真嗣困惑地看着两人，“美里小姐？”

She turned to Shinji. From across the room Misato regarded him, but she did not look at his face. "When the Second Impact happened in Antarctica, it was because my father discovered something there fifteen years ago. I don't know what, or how, but I know my father unearthed an Angel that day, I was the only one to-" Misato gently weighed the cross that dangled on her neck. "So many people died that day, Shinji. We can't let it happen again, not for the sake of discovery, or for anything."  
她转向真嗣。从房间的另一端，美里注视着他，却没有看他的脸。“南极发生的第二次冲击，是因为我父亲十五年前在那里发现了什么。我不知道是什么，也不知道是如何发现的，但我知道那天父亲挖掘出了一个使徒，我是唯一一个——”美里轻轻地抚摸着挂在脖子上的十字架。“那天死了很多人，真嗣。我们不能让它再次发生，不是为了发现，也不是为了任何东西。”

Asuka frowned as she quietly listened.  
明日香皱起眉头，静静地听着。

"Misato, I'm so sorry." “美里，我很抱歉。”

"Yes, it was very tragic. And your father was a great man…" Naoko looked down and sighed, "Anyways, Shinji?" She called out, and he lifted his solemn head up, "How do you feel about holding down the fort for a day or two?"  
“是的，那非常悲惨。而且你的父亲是个伟大的人……”直子低下头叹了口气，“总之，真嗣？”她呼唤道，他抬起沉重的头，“你觉得独自守卫这里一两天怎么样？”

"H-hold down the fort?"

"Well, you and Rei."

Shinji tugged at his collar, "I don't, wouldn't Asuka be more suited for that?"

Naoko shrugged, "I disagree, because I couldn't imagine anyone other than Asuka presenting the world to Evangelion today."  
直子耸了耸肩，“我不同意，因为我无法想象除了明日香之外，还有谁能将《新世纪福音战士》今天呈现给世界。”

Everyone turned to Asuka as she lifted her head in realization of what she just said. "Me?"  
所有人都转向明日香，她抬起头意识到自己刚刚说了什么。“我吗？”

"Of course, you are my star player after all."  
“当然，毕竟你是我最耀眼的明星选手。”

"She is indeed our most considerable candidate." Kyoko affirmed from the back of the room, and Asuka had to suppress her shock.  
"她确实是我们最值得考虑的候选人。" 从房间后方传来了响子的肯定，明日香不得不压下心中的震惊。

"Couldn't have said it better myself." Naoko said, "What do you say, Asuka? Like we always talked about? You and I will show Evangelion to the world and define their future. By the end of this year we will have nearly a dozen EVA units. And you…"  
"我无法说得更好了。" 直子说道，"你怎么看，明日香？就像我们一直讨论的那样？你和我将向世界展示福音战士，定义他们的未来。到今年年底，我们将拥有近十台 EVA 单位。而你……"

Naoko clicked on one final slide that showed a rough concept of a large party of silver EVA's that flew airborne.  
直子点击了最后一张幻灯片，展示了一群银色 EVA 空中飞行的粗略概念。

And in the center, they were led by a red-winged Unit-02.  
而在中央，他们由一架红色翼装的 02 号机带领。

"You will be their captain."  
“你将成为他们的队长。”

Shinji looked amazed at the idea of an army of EVA's, "This is great! This way, no Angel would be able to beat us, right?" He looked at Fuyutsuki, who turned away from Shinji, to hide his expression once again. Shinji looked at Asuka, and his smile dropped as he noticed Asuka's smile was gone too, in fact, she covered her mouth as if she were about to be sick.  
真嗣对组建一支 EVA 军队的主意感到惊讶，“这太棒了！这样一来，没有使徒能打败我们，对吧？”他看向冬月，后者再次转过身去，掩饰自己的表情。真嗣转向明日香，笑容随即消失，因为他注意到明日香的笑容也不见了，实际上，她捂住了嘴，仿佛要呕吐一般。

"Langley?" Shinji asked gently, "Are you okay?"  
"兰利？" 真嗣温柔地问道，"你还好吗？"

"So?" Naoko beamed, "What do you say, 'Captain'?"  
"所以呢？" 直子笑着说，"你怎么说，'舰长'？"

Asuka looked her way and shrugged off whatever she felt, "I had a big breakfast that's all." She cleared her throat, thumped her chest. Asuka grinned at Shinji, "And that's _Captain_ Langley to you now, scrub."  
明日香朝她看了一眼，耸了耸肩，掩饰自己的情绪，"我吃了顿丰盛的早餐，仅此而已。"她清了清喉咙，拍了拍胸口。明日香对真嗣咧嘴一笑，"现在我是兰利舰长，你这个菜鸟。"

Shinji shook his head. 真嗣摇了摇头。

Misato didn't seem to notice her nausea the way Shinji did and chuckled at the first sign of happiness she had seen in Asuka for a long time, "Don't get too cocky kid, congratulations."  
美里似乎没有像真嗣那样注意到她的恶心感，而是对长久以来在明日香脸上看到的第一丝喜悦轻笑道，“别太得意忘形了，孩子，恭喜你。”

"Yeah, yeah…" Asuka stood up and bowed, "Thank you, Naoko. I won't let you down."  
“是，是……”明日香站起身鞠了一躬，“谢谢你，直子。我不会让你失望的。”

"Oh, I know you won't."  
"哦，我知道你不会的。"

Ritsuko frowned, she had still been focused on a certain detail. "Mother?"  
律子皱了皱眉，她仍然专注于某个细节。“母亲？”

"Yes?" “是的？”

"You said… 'You and I.' Are you coming to the conference with us?"  
"你说过……‘你和我’。你会和我们一起去参加会议吗？"

Naoko looked down, "Oh yes. I think the direness of this situation requires… a more qualified set of hands."  
直子低下头，"哦，是的。我认为这个严峻的情况需要……更专业的一双手。"

"But what about HQ? Who will run NERV while everyone is gone?" Ritsuko replied.  
"但总部怎么办？大家都不在的时候，谁来管理 NERV？" 律子回答道。"

"Well, you of course." Naoko said plain as day. She watched as her daughter attempted to stammer through a reply, "Cat got your tongue? Don't be so shocked, I always said you would be a leader one day."  
"当然是你了。" 直子直截了当地说。她看着女儿试图结结巴巴地回答，"舌头被猫叼走了？别这么惊讶，我总是说有一天你会成为领导者的。"

Misato stood up, "What about me? I'm the Operations Director, no offence to you, Ritsuko, but I'm more qualified for this situation."  
美里站起身来，"那我呢？我是作战部长，不是对你不敬，律子，但在这个情况下我更合适。"

"I picked her for a reason, Misato. You have a very important job with me today. Ritsuko will be fine, our projected Angel arrival isn't due for another week, you will plan for the occasion while Fuyutsuki provides you with counsel. Although I really doubt it will come to that, all parents have the day off today so it'll just be a skeleton crew at HQ."  
"我选她是有原因的，美里。你今天和我有一个非常重要的任务。律子会没事的，我们预计的天使到来时间还有一周，你将为此制定计划，而副校长会给你提供建议。虽然我真的很怀疑会发展到那一步，今天所有家长都放假，所以总部只会留下一个骨干团队。"

"Unless of course, you think my daughter isn't capable." Naoko challenged.  
"除非你认为我女儿做不到。" 直子挑衅地说。

"Of course not. It's in good hands." A small smile was shared between the two. Misato gently patted Ritsuko's shoulder and she flinched involuntarily.  
"当然不是。她会处理得很好。" 两人之间交换了一个淡淡的微笑。美里轻轻拍了拍律子的肩膀，她不由自主地缩了一下。

"Rits, we'll talk more shop later when we- oh." _Also Sprach Zarathustra_ played from Naoko's phone, "Sorry, that's me. Hello? Yes?" Naoko turned away from the others and looked down, "He's what?" She looked at Shinji and covered her mouth, her eyes wrinkled. "Oh no, is he alright?"  
"律子，我们稍后再详细讨论工作，当我们——哦。" 《查拉图斯特拉如是说》的音乐从直子的手机中响起，"抱歉，是我。喂？是的？" 直子转过身去，低头看着手机，"他怎么了？" 她看向真嗣，用手捂住嘴，眼睛皱了起来。"哦不，他没事吧？"

Shinji's chest tightened as he looked desperately at Fuyutsuki, who didn't look away this time, they shared the same confusion.  
真嗣的胸口紧缩，他绝望地看向冬月，这次冬月没有移开目光，他们共享着同样的困惑。

"I see. I'll have someone escort him there immediately. Thank you." She hung up the phone. "Shinji, I have some bad news, you may need to brace yourself."  
"我明白了。我会立刻派人护送他过去。谢谢。" 她挂断了电话。"真嗣，我有坏消息，你可能需要做好心理准备。"

"W-why, whats-" "为、为什么，什、什么——"

"Your father, Gendo, he's in the hospital. He's in very bad shape, they said something about a-"  
"你父亲，源堂，他在医院。情况非常糟糕，他们说是什么……"

"-Motorcycle crash…" "……摩托车事故……"

Naoko stared at Shinji, "How did you know that?"  
直子盯着真嗣，“你怎么知道的？”

Shinji shot out of his chair and nearly tripped on it as made his way to the exit.  
真嗣猛地从椅子上跳起来，差点被椅子绊倒，急忙向出口跑去。

Misato looked at Naoko, "Well is he okay?"  
美里看着直子，"他没事吧？"

"He came by the school earlier-" Shinji replied hastily as he ran up the stairs, "I'm sorry but I have to go!"  
"他之前来过学校——" 真嗣一边跑上楼梯一边急忙回答，"对不起，我得走了！"

"Why am I only hearing this now?" Naoko stared at Asuka and Rei. "Shinji, I asked you a question." Naoko said sharply.  
“为什么我现在才听说这件事？”直子盯着明日香和丽。“真嗣，我刚才问了你一个问题。”直子尖锐地说道。

He ignored her. 他无视了她。

"Shinji!" Naoko called out to him and he froze at the door.  
“真嗣！”直子朝他喊道，他在门口僵住了。

Misato stared at Ritsuko at the sudden outburst, who looked down.  
美里盯着突然爆发的律子，后者低头不语。

"How exactly do you plan on getting to the surface? Misato will drive you. You know on second thought, I'll come to. I've been meaning to pay your father a visit for years."  
“你究竟打算怎么到地面上去？美里会开车送你。对了，我突然想到，我也一起去吧。多年来我一直想拜访你父亲。”

"I… I don't know what to say-"  
“我……我不知道该说什么——”

"-How about thank you?" "-谢谢如何？"

"Commander." Kyoko interjected, "Time is of the essence today, surely someone else can be bothered with this."  
"指挥官。" 绫子插话道，"今天时间紧迫，肯定有人能抽空处理这个。"

"Nonsense, I'll make time. Besides what Shinji needs right now is support from his friends. You and Ritsuko stay here and oversee preparations." Naoko thought for a moment, "Asuka, you'll come with us too. It's better if we're all in one place."  
"别胡说，我会抽出时间的。况且真嗣现在需要的是朋友的支持。你和律子留在这里监督准备工作。" 直子想了一会儿，"明日香，你也跟我们一起去。大家聚在一起比较好。"

Asuka gestured to her school uniform, "Shouldn't I wear something more… formal?"  
明日香指着自己的校服，“我是不是应该穿得更……正式些？”

"Don't worry, I have something picked out for you already. We'll drop you kids off at the hospital, finish business here at headquarters and pick you up in an hour, sounds good?"  
“别担心，我已经为你挑好了衣服。我们会先把你们送到医院，然后在总部处理完事务，一小时后再来接你们，听起来不错吧？”

Fuyutsuki stood up and followed Shinji, "It's best Gendo doesn't see me, but I'll come with you."  
冬月站起身，跟着真嗣，“最好别让源堂看到我，但我还是跟你一起去吧。”

He smiled, "Thank you, Mr. Fuyutsuki."  
他微笑着，“谢谢您，冬月先生。”

The Commander clapped her hands together, "Great! Back in the cars-"  
指挥官拍了拍手，“太好了！回到车上——”

"-Wait!" Shinji yelped out. Naoko zeroed in on Shinji, her smile strained at the interruption. "Shouldn't Rei come with us too then?"  
“——等等！”真嗣急忙喊道。直子立刻转向真嗣，她的笑容因这打断而显得有些勉强。“那丽也应该和我们一起去吧？”

"Oh. I don't see why that's necessary."  
"哦，我不明白这有什么必要。"

"W-well it's like you said, it's better if we're all in one place, right?"  
"嗯，就像你说的，我们都聚在一起会更好，对吧？"

"I disagree-" "我不同意——"

"-We really don't have time for this debate, Naoko." Misato stood up as well and followed Shinji out the door. "With all due respect, let's just support Shinji however we can."  
"-我们真的没时间争论这个，直子。" 美里也站了起来，跟着真嗣走出门外。"恕我直言，我们还是尽可能支持真嗣吧。"

The Commander's hands gripped tightly around the edges of her coat, as though she were about to rip off its seams. A contorted smile grew on her face as she stared at Misato. "Sure. Why not? Lets just… you hear that 'Rei'?" The girl's head perked up at the sound of her name.  
指挥官的双手紧紧抓住外套的边缘，仿佛要撕裂它的缝线。她扭曲的笑容在脸上蔓延，盯着美里。"当然，为什么不呢？我们只是……你听到了吗，'丽'？"女孩听到自己的名字，头抬了起来。

The others couldn't see as they made their way out the door, but Naoko's entire body shook as she forced out a sharp exhale, her jaw clenched. "You're gonna meet Gendo."  
其他人走出门口时看不见，但直子的整个身体都在颤抖，她用力呼出一口气，紧咬着牙关。"你要去见源堂。"

### Chapter 6 Alone in the Crystal Part II

Shinji hurried down the halls of the hospital wing while the others struggled to catch up with him.  
真嗣在医院走廊里急匆匆地走着，其他人则努力跟上他的步伐。

The immense heat that punctured through the windows set the doctors, nurses and orderlies into a frenzy as they ran from room to room. The normally quiet hospital was hit with a wave of heat-induced strokes in the past week, despite it only being the end of March.  
穿透窗户的炽热高温让医生、护士和勤务人员陷入一片混乱，他们从一个房间跑到另一个房间。尽管才三月底，这家平日里安静的医院在过去一周内却遭遇了一波因高温引发的中风潮。

He counted the numbers of each room until he stopped at- "R-26…" He searched for his visitor's key card in his velcro wallet, swiped it through the locked door's reader and it opened.  
他逐一数着每个房间的编号，直到停在——“R-26……”他在维可牢钱包里寻找访客的钥匙卡，刷过锁着的门读卡器，门便打开了。

But Shinji stepped inside his father's usual room and found it empty. His father's nurse collected his things in a small cardboard box.  
但真嗣走进他父亲常住的房间，却发现里面空无一人。他父亲的护士正在将他的物品收集进一个小纸箱里。

"Mrs. Sato?" “佐藤女士？”

She turned around and gasped, "Shinji! Your father, I'm so sorry, I didn't know he would go this far, he- he hasn't been himself since he's been moved here-"  
她转过身来，惊呼道：“真嗣！你父亲，我很抱歉，我不知道他会做到这种地步，他——自从搬到这里后，他就变得不太对劲——”

"-Mrs. Sato, please, what happened?"  
“——佐藤太太，请告诉我，发生了什么？”

Mrs. Sato looked down at the box in shame, "We were having our morning coffee, and I don't know how he got my keys, but I think I left my purse on the floor, and…"  
佐藤太太羞愧地看着手中的盒子，“我们正在喝早上的咖啡，我不知道他是怎么拿到我的钥匙的，但我想我把钱包落在地上了，而且……”

"I know, he came by the school. Is…is he…"  
"我知道，他来过学校。他……他……"

"When he crashed my scooter-"  
"他撞坏了我的滑板车——"

Naoko entered the room, "-Did I hear you say that you had coffee with your patient? Are you aware that that's a breach in your confidentiality agreement?"  
直子走进房间，""我好像听到你说和你的病人一起喝了咖啡？你知道这违反了保密协议吗？"

The family nurse put her one hand on her hips and huffed, "I'll have you know I've been looking after Mr. Ikari for nearly six years, and there's nothing wrong with enjoying a cup of coffee with your patient-"  
家庭护士一手叉腰，气呼呼地说：“我得告诉你，我已经照顾碇先生近六年了，和病人一起喝杯咖啡没什么不对的——”

"-Well clearly, you let your guard down."  
“——显然，你放松警惕了。”

Mrs. Sato stared quizzically at Naoko. "I'm sorry, who are you exactly?"  
佐藤太太疑惑地看着直子。“对不起，你到底是谁？”

The Commander, still in civilian clothes, stared at her blankly, she took a step closer to Mrs. Sato. "Who am I?"  
指挥官依旧身着便装，茫然地盯着她，随即向佐藤夫人迈近一步。“我是谁？”

Shinji stepped in between them."That doesn't matter right now!"  
真嗣插进他们之间。“现在这无关紧要！”

Naoko swatted away his gentle hand with more force than he thought she was capable of, but she quickly withdrew.  
直子用力挥开了他轻柔的手，力度之大出乎他的意料，但她很快又退了回去。

Shinji held his hand, with no time or focus to process that, he turned to Mrs. Sato, "W-w-where is he?"  
真嗣握住他的手，没有时间和精力去处理这一刻的感受，他转向佐藤夫人，结结巴巴地问：“他、他在哪儿？”

"C-49, your card should work."  
“C-49，你的卡应该能用。”

Shinji frantically scanned the signs labeled on the entrance to each room, but the sunlight bled even through all the shutted blinds and spotted his vision.  
真嗣焦急地扫视着每个房间入口处的标识，但阳光透过所有紧闭的百叶窗，斑驳地洒在他的视野中。

Ms. Sato pointed her towards the right, but Naoko spoke over her, "Asuka, show him where to go. I'll catch up with you."  
佐藤小姐指向右边，但直子抢在她之前说道：“明日香，带他去该去的地方。我会追上你们的。”

"Right!" Asuka called by the door frame, "I know this place like the back of my hand, let's move it rookie!" Shinji's sneakers squeaked on the hospital floor as jogged beside her.  
“好嘞！”明日香在门框边喊道，“我对这个地方了如指掌，快跟上，菜鸟！”真嗣的跑鞋在医院地板上发出吱吱声，他小跑着跟在她旁边。

The two ran in silence.  
两人沉默地奔跑着。

"And no, I wasn't eavesdropping. I just heard my name."  
"而且不，我不是在偷听。我只是听到了我的名字。"

"Huh?" “啊？”

"I said double time!" Asuka pointed down at the coloured lines that stretched on the hospital floor. "We need to follow the red one."  
"我说快点！" 明日香指着医院地板上延伸的彩色线条。"我们需要跟着红色的走。"

Misato struggled to follow behind the two while Fuyutsuki and Rei simply walked. Her boots wobbled as she tried to match their pace. The red line to the intensive care ward led them to twists and turns through the heated maze, until the other colors were gone and it was only a red streak in a long white hallway.  
美里努力跟在两人后面，而冬月和绫波只是简单地走着。她的靴子摇晃着，试图跟上他们的步伐。通往重症监护区的红线引导他们在炽热的迷宫中曲折前行，直到其他颜色消失，只剩下一条长长的白色走廊中的红色痕迹。

_I hate hospitals… 我讨厌医院……_

---

"C-42… C-45…" Shinji muttered as he scanned each room they passed through, "C-44? come on…"  
"C-42… C-45…" 真嗣喃喃自语，他们经过的每个房间他都仔细查看，"C-44？快点……"

Down the end of the hall, echoes of a struggle and garbled grunts traveled towards them.  
走廊尽头，挣扎声和含糊的咕哝声向他们传来。

The grunts turned more and more feral, Asuka instinctively glanced at Misato's way to confirm if it sounded just as inhuman to her ears.  
低吼声变得越来越野蛮，Asuka 本能地朝 Misato 的方向瞥了一眼，想确认这声音在她耳中是否也同样非人。

"Hold… still!" A young male nurse called out through muffled doors.  
“别…动！”一个年轻男护士透过厚重的门喊道。

"_Nho!"_  “不！”

Shinji gasped, "That's my father!"  
真嗣倒抽一口凉气，“那是我父亲！”

Asuka's ears tuned in to the exact room the sounds were coming from at the end of the hall. Once it was a match she pointed at the left side and barked at Shinji, "C-49, there it is! Go!"  
明日香的耳朵准确地捕捉到了声音来自走廊尽头的哪个房间。一旦确认，她指向左侧，对真嗣厉声道：“C-49，就在那儿！快去！”

Without question he ran down that end, he fumbled again for his key card while he stood on his tiptoes to see through the steel door's window. Asuka and Misato couldn't see as she caught up to him, but it definitely was provoking enough to make the meek boy furious.  
他毫不犹豫地冲向那头，再次摸索着找他的钥匙卡，同时踮起脚尖试图透过钢门的窗户窥视。明日香和美里赶上来时看不见里面的情况，但这足以激起这个温顺男孩的怒火。

"Oy!"

"What is it, is he okay?" Misato called out.  
"怎么了，他没事吧？" 美里喊道。

"I told them not to do that!" Shinji swiped his card repeatedly, but it would only let out a flat beep in response. "Osamu! Open the door!"  
"我告诉过他们不要这么做！" 真嗣反复刷卡，但门只发出一声单调的哔声回应。"修一！开门！"

"_No visitors allowed!"_ An elderly lady barked back.  
"不许访客进入！" 一位老妇人厉声回道。

"Open the door!" "开门！"

Misato tried to push him aside but he kept himself rooted as he firmly rapped at the door.. "Shinji, stop it, you're making a scene. Let me see." She saw two nurses manhandle a bandaged Gendo Ikari by his arms, which they shamelessly did until they saw the additional set of adult eyes glaring at them. "Hey! Hey you!" They quickly let him go, "Yeah, I saw that!"  
美里试图推开他，但他坚定地站在原地，用力敲门。“真嗣，别闹了，你在惹人注意。让我看看。”她看到两名护士粗鲁地架着缠满绷带的本部源堂，直到他们注意到另一双成年人的眼睛正瞪着他们。“嘿！嘿，你们！”他们迅速放开他，“对，我看到了！”

The two nurses, one a tall, lanky, young man and the other old. They stared at each other, unsure what to do until Misato placed her NERV ID against the glass window. She squinted at two and motioned them to unlock the door with a single finger.  
两名护士，一个高瘦的年轻人和另一个年长的。他们面面相觑，不知所措，直到美里将她的 NERV ID 贴在玻璃窗上。她眯眼看着两人，用一根手指示意他们解锁门。

Gendo, his head and arm bandaged, leaned to see who his rescuers were.  
源堂头部和手臂都缠着绷带，侧身想看清救他的人是谁。

The older nurse, hesitantly, slowly, approached the door. "_Young Ikari, we tried to call you!"_ Her smile dropped as Shinji continued to glare at her, "_You must understand, he was acting crazy, he-"_  
年长的护士犹豫着，缓缓走向门口。“小碇，我们试图联系你！”她的笑容在真嗣继续瞪着她时消失了，“你必须明白，他当时行为疯狂，他——”

"What kind of nurses handle a car-crash patient like that!?" Misato shouted through the window, right behind Shinji.  
“什么样的护士会这样对待车祸病人！？”美里透过窗户在真嗣身后大喊。

"_I said he's crazy! He, he steals Mrs. Sato's bike, he crashed it, and now he's worse!"_  
"我说他疯了！他，他偷了佐藤太太的自行车，还把它撞坏了，现在他更糟糕了！"

"And he knocked me over with the bike too!" The lanky nurse in the background called out. "And he bit me!"  
"他还用自行车把我撞倒了！" 背景中那位高瘦的护士喊道。"他还咬了我一口！"

"Hey you shut up, pinhead, no one asked you!" Asuka shouted back, she joined the others behind the window and fought to have the most space to verbally barrage the two orderlies.  
"嘿，你闭嘴，小脑袋，没人问你！" 明日香回喊道，她加入窗后的其他人，努力争取最大的空间来对那两名护工进行言语攻击。"

"_D-don't bully me because I'm doing my job! Someone has to give him his medicine-"_  
"别因为我在工作就欺负我！总得有人给他吃药——"

"Tylenol?" Shinji replied. "Really Osamu, Tylenol?"  
"泰诺？" 真嗣回答道。"真的吗，大介，泰诺？"

"_Yes, tylenol!"_ "是的，泰诺！"

"_Shih-hee?"_ Gendo called out, still trying to see.  
"诗惠？" 源度呼唤着，依旧试图看清。

"If you knew your job then you'd know to give him his space like you were instructed to by me and Mrs. Sato!"  
"如果你了解你的工作，你就该知道像我和佐藤夫人指示的那样给他空间！"

The two nurses stayed silent. Asuka and Misato exchanged a stunned glance.  
两位护士保持沉默。明日香和美里交换了一个震惊的眼神。

Shinji let out an annoyed groan and pointed to Misato, "Just open the door before I have my Guardian revoke both your licenses. She'll do it."  
真嗣发出一声烦躁的呻吟，指向美里，“在我让我的守护者吊销你们俩的驾照之前，快把门打开。她真会这么干的。”

Asuka nodded to confirm. "I've seen her do it. What are you waiting for!? Make it snappy!"  
明日香点头确认。“我见过她这么做。你还等什么！？快点！”

The older nurse gasped and hurried to the door.  
年长的护士倒吸一口气，急忙向门口跑去。

Misato wiped the sweat off her brow, "Ah, Shinji, I can't actually-" But she bit her tongue as the door hisses open and he quickly entered.  
美里擦去额头的汗水，“啊，真嗣，我其实不能——”但当门嘶嘶作响地打开，他迅速进入时，她咬住了舌头。

"Father! Are you okay?" “父亲！您还好吗？”

"Hnn." Gendo half-heartedly waved him away.  
“嗯。”源堂半心半意地挥手让他离开。

Shinji turned back to Misato, who hesitantly waited in the arch-way, the two nurses stepped aside, "Thanks for the help, I'll be right back."  
真嗣转回身面对美里，她犹豫地站在拱门处，两名护士退到一旁，“谢谢帮忙，我马上回来。”

Misato nodded, "Of course." Shinji smiled and nodded back as he reached to close the door. "Are you sure I shouldn't-"  
美里点头，“当然。”真嗣微笑着点头回应，伸手去关门。“你确定我不该——”

The door hisses closed. Asuka and Misato both hesitantly side-eyed each other as it suddenly becomes very, very quiet.  
门嘶嘶地关上了。明日香和美里都犹豫地互相瞥了一眼，突然间变得非常非常安静。

"..."

"Well at least he's not dead."  
"至少他还活着。"

"Asuka." “明日香。”

"What? He'll live." "什么？他会没事的。"

Shinji stomped towards the light switch, his voice now muffled too, "_Why do you have so many lights on if he has a head injury?"_  
真嗣朝电灯开关走去，声音也变得含糊不清，“他头部受伤了，为什么你还开着这么多灯？”

The nurses stammered indistinctly in response as Misato watched on.  
护士们含糊不清地回应着，美里在一旁注视着。

"Guess he's got it." Misato said quietly.  
“看来他确实有这本事。”美里轻声说道。

"Right. Now let's see if he can keep his balls outside of his purse while we're gone." Asuka added, she stood as far from Misato as the view of the door would allow.  
“没错。现在看看他能否在我们离开时保持冷静。”明日香补充道，她尽可能远离美里，站在门口视线所及的最远处。

"I wasn't sure before but y'know… I think he will."  
"之前我不太确定，但你知道的……我想他会。"

"Guess I won't be needed here then."  
"那看来这里就不需要我了。"

"It's not that Asuka, you're just needed elsewhere for now."  
"不是那样的，明日香，只是现在你需要去别的地方。"

"Whatever that means…" "那是什么意思…"

"_I ol yew oo runah away!"_  
"我哦爱你，你跑哪儿去了！"

"_Not now, father- let me handle this!"_ The lights switched off, one by one until only the rays that bled through the blinders illuminated that room. The now visible dust particles blanketed the air. "_And what's this!?"_  
"现在不行，父亲——让我来处理这个！" 灯光一盏接一盏地熄灭，直到只有透过遮光帘透进来的光线照亮了房间。现在可以看见的尘埃颗粒弥漫在空气中。"这是什么！？"

Misato glanced at Asuka, "Thank you, for helping him, by the way."  
美里瞥了一眼明日香，“谢谢你，顺便说一句，帮助了他。”

"Just a job from the boss. Besides, I knew my way around the place."  
“只是老板交代的任务。再说了，我对这个地方了如指掌。”

"That's what worries me. 'Like the back of your hand'?"  
“这正是让我担心的地方。‘了如指掌’？”

"Well from that first fight and the other time, I visited Rei when-when she had her accident. And so what? If you actually visited me back then you would've known how many times I've been here."  
"从那第一次战斗和另一次，我去看望丽的时候——她遭遇了事故。那又怎样？如果你当时真的来看我，你就会知道我来过多少次了。"

"I did visit you, Asuka, but by the time I got there, the nurses told me that you've woken up and stolen a staff bicycle-"  
"我确实去看过你，明日香，但我到那里时，护士告诉我你已经醒了，还偷了一辆工作人员的自行车——"

"-I wanted to go home."  
"——我想回家。"

"Did your mother say anything to you when you… you know?"  
"你妈妈在你……你知道的，那时候，跟你说了什么吗？"

"Why do you even care? It's not your job anymore."  
"你为什么还关心这个？这已经不是你的职责了。"

"Actually, until we get back from the conference, it will be my job because I volunteered to oversee your security detail."  
"实际上，在我们从会议回来之前，这还是我的职责，因为我自愿负责你的安保工作。"

"What!? You can't-" "什么！？你不能——"

"The Boss's orders." "老板的命令。"

Asuka snorted at that, "Great, so you're gonna be, what, my handler? My babysitter?"  
明日香对此嗤之以鼻，"“好极了，那你打算做什么，我的联络人？我的保姆？”

"Your bodyguard. I'm gonna protect you."  
"你的保镖。我会保护你。"

"Seriously?" "真的吗？"

"Dead serious." Misato turned to Asuka and leveled to her eye-line, "Look, don't worry about anything, or what anyone else says there. If you feel overwhelmed, or scared, just say the word and I'll pull the plug, okay?"  
"非常认真。" 美里转向明日香，与她视线齐平，"听着，别担心任何事，也别管别人说什么。如果你感到不知所措或害怕，只要说一声，我就会拔掉插头，好吗？"

Asuka glared at Misato, as though testing her sincerity. When she couldn't feel any falter in Misato's words, Asuka looked away to consider it, if she could risk acquiescing to her promises.  
明日香瞪着美里，仿佛在测试她的真诚。当她感觉不到美里话语中的动摇时，明日香转过头去思考，是否可以冒险相信她的承诺。

The door suddenly _hisses_ open, and the two jump out of the way. Out the low shuttered lit room, the two nurses shuffled out, their heads lowered in shame.  
门突然嘶嘶作响地打开，两人急忙闪到一旁。从那间低矮、百叶窗透着光的房间里，两位护士低着头，羞愧地走了出来。

Osamu, that younger lankier nurse turned to Asuka and Misato, his head still lowered. "We're sorry for that scene." They didn't reply, "The heat must've driven him crazy."  
年轻的、更高挑的护士 Osamu 转向 Asuka 和 Misato，头依然低垂着。"我们为刚才的场面感到抱歉。"她们没有回应，"一定是高温让他发疯了。"

"I think it's driving everyone a little crazy."  
“我觉得这高温让大家都有些疯狂。”

Osamu and the other nurse scurried away.  
修与另一位护士匆忙离开。

"Shinji? Dr. Ikari? How are you guys doing there?" Misato called out.  
“真嗣？碇医生？你们那边怎么样了？”美里喊道。

"We're okay!" Shinji's dimly lit figure waved them over, "Would you like to meet my father?" Gendo let out a displeased groan. "Don't be like that."  
“我们没事！”真嗣那昏暗的身影挥手示意他们过来，“想见见我父亲吗？”源渡发出一声不悦的咕哝。“别这样。”

"Sure!" Misato said quickly.  
"当然！" 美里迅速回答道。

"Uh, no thanks." Asuka tried to back away.  
"呃，不用了，谢谢。" 明日香试图后退。

"Asuka, come on." Misato said in a low voice.  
"明日香，别这样。" 美里低声说道。

She turned to Misato and replied through gritted teeth, "Look, lady- I don't wanna be _buddy-buddy_ with that _psycho_."  
她转向美里，咬牙切齿地回答：“听着，女士——我不想和那个疯子称兄道弟。”

Shinji waved his hand to Misato to get her attention, "Ms. Misato, It's fine-"  
真嗣向美里挥手以吸引她的注意，“美里小姐，没事的——”

"Soryew?" Gendo said out loud, almost confused that he even said it. "Heeyoh-hoh's augher?"  
“对不起？”源堂大声说道，几乎对自己说出这话感到困惑。“他在哪儿？”

Misato tilted her ear closer to him, "Huh?"  
美里将耳朵向他凑近，“嗯？”

"Soryew, Engly-Soryew?" “对不起，英语-对不起？”

Shinji looked at Asuka and nervously touched his father's shoulder. "She doesn't like to go by that. That's Asuka. She's my… ah, she's one of the… co-workers. She's my Captain, of the- co-workers." He nodded and let out a nervous chuckle.  
真嗣看着明日香，紧张地碰了碰他父亲的肩膀。“她不喜欢别人那么叫她。那是明日香。她是我的……呃，她是其中一位……同事。她是我的队长，也就是同事们的……队长。”他点点头，发出了一声紧张的轻笑。

"Yer Soryew?" "你是索留？"

Misato nodded in understanding, "Oh, I see." She pointed at Asuka, "Yes, that's Chief Scientist Soryu's daughter, Asuka." She led Asuka closer to the hospital bed that Gendo laid on by her shoulders.  
Misato 点头表示理解，“哦，我明白了。”她指着 Asuka 说，“是的，那是首席科学家索留的女儿，Asuka。”她扶着 Asuka 的肩膀，带她走近 Gendo 躺着的病床。

"Langley." Asuka corrected and shrugged off Misato, "It's just Langley..You must've gotten the other part mixed up. " She half-waved, "Anyways, nice to meetcha-"  
"兰格利。" Asuka 纠正道，并甩开 Misato 的手，“只是兰格利..你一定是把另一部分搞混了。”她半挥手，“总之，很高兴见到你——”

Gendo grunted and shook his head, he leaned in closer and lowered his taped-together spectacles. He motioned Asuka to come closer, who took a single stomp closer and inspected him the same.  
源渡哼了一声，摇了摇头，他凑得更近，调整了一下用胶带粘在一起的眼镜。他示意明日香靠近些，她便重重地踏出一步，同样仔细地打量着他。

Naoko certainly painted a better picture of the decrepit old man to Asuka, in her many stories of the 'Glory days.'  
直子在给明日香讲述那些‘辉煌岁月’的众多故事中，确实描绘了一个比眼前这位破败老人更为生动的形象。

He stank, first and foremost. Of something rotten in or on him. He had a beard larger and more scraggly than any Japanese man she had seen. And of course the idiotic, steely, vacant Ikari stare was also very strong in the slack jawed old man.  
首先，他身上散发着一股腐臭味，不知是体内还是体表。他的胡须比她见过的任何日本男人都要浓密且凌乱。当然，那呆滞、冷酷、空洞的碇式眼神，在这位下巴松弛的老人身上也尤为明显。

Old man Ikari grunted again in confirmation, "Thas Soryew. Yer Soryew's."  
碇老爹再次哼了一声以示确认，“那是索耶。你的索耶。”

Asuka's left eye twitched.  
明日香的左眼抽搐了一下。

"He's uh, It's better if you just ignore him, Langley."  
“呃，你最好还是别理他，兰格雷。”

"Asuka…" Misato also warned.  
"明日香…" 美里也警告道。

She gritted her teeth. "You heard your kid. It's Langley. Captain. Langley."  
她咬紧牙关。"你听到了吧，孩子。是兰格雷。上尉。兰格雷。"

He pointed at her, "Soryew."  
他指着她，"抱歉。"

Asuka stamped her foot on the ground so hard it felt as though lightning struck, "The fuck you think you're talking to, old man!?"  
明日香用力跺脚，仿佛雷电轰鸣，"你他妈以为自己在跟谁说话，老头儿！？"

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

A strange shriek came from below Gendo's bed.  
源堂的床下传来一声怪异的尖叫。

Misato screeched and jumped on the visitor's chair, "What is that!?"  
美里尖叫着跳到访客椅上，"那是什么！？"

"It's okay, Miss Misato, I think Langley just startled the cat."  
"没事的，美里小姐，我想兰利只是吓到了那只猫。"

"Oh…" Misato chuckled nervously at Gendo as she climbed down the chair, "Excuse me."  
"哦…"" 美里尴尬地笑了笑，从椅子上爬下来，对碇说：""不好意思。"

Asuka's ears perked up. She wordlessly crouched down to see the solid gray tabby that hid under the bed, its glowing eyes wide and illuminated from the slotted rays of light. "Aw… I'm sorry, buddy. "  
明日香的耳朵竖了起来。她无声地蹲下，看向躲在床下的那只纯灰色虎斑猫，它的眼睛在光线的照射下闪闪发亮，显得又大又亮。""哎呀…对不起，小家伙。"

Shinji crouched down next to Asuka. "That's Tadeo."  
真嗣蹲在明日香旁边。“那是塔德奥。”

"Hey, Tadeo." “嘿，塔德奥。”

The cat remained in the corner, its ears tucked far back, rather annoyed at their presence in his territory.  
那只猫依旧蜷缩在角落里，耳朵紧紧贴着脑袋，显然对他们的闯入感到不悦。

Misato turned to Gendo, "I am so sorry for her behavior."  
美里转向源度，“我对她的行为感到非常抱歉。”

"She is her mohers augher." Gendo replied.  
“她是她母亲的女儿。”源度回答道。

"Right." Misato couldn't force a smile at the thought of Kyoko Soryu if her life depended on it, but she tried either way and grimaced. "How about this heat, huh?"  
“没错。”想到绫波京子，美里无论如何也挤不出一丝笑容，但她还是尝试了一下，结果只是皱了皱眉。“这天气真热，对吧？”

Gendo grunted in agreement. The blinds provided some solace, but the slits of light that got through felt like little razors burning into your skin.  
源度哼了一声表示同意。百叶窗提供了些许慰藉，但透过来的那些细缝光线却如同小刀般灼烧着你的皮肤。

Misato chuckled nervously, "And I haven't even introduced myself yet! We spoke over the phone."  
美里紧张地笑了笑，"我还没自我介绍呢！我们之前通过电话。"

He stared at her blankly.  
他茫然地盯着她。

"I'm your son's guardian."  
"我是你儿子的监护人。"

"Ah." Gendo offered his rattling hand and Misato shook it firmly.  
"啊。" 源度伸出颤抖的手，美里坚定地握住了它。

"Katsuragi Misato, nice to finally meet you."  
"葛城美里，很高兴终于见到你了。"

The silver from Misato's cross caught the sunlight and glinted in Gendo's eyes with recognition. When he looked back up to meet her eyes, she was the shrewd and spiteful child his friend once proudly introduced to him to. That image blurred into a memory of a ghost his crew mates found drifting in the arctic. She haunted everyone on board as they made their way back home, all of them too fearful to look into her aimless eyes. There was a shine that was gone in them, far too earlier than any child deserved. Only the mask of maturity was the difference he saw, the shine must have never found its way back.  
Misato 的十字架上的银色在阳光下闪烁，映入 Gendo 的眼中，他立刻认出了这光芒。当他再次抬头与她的目光相遇时，她仍是那个精明且充满怨恨的孩子，他的朋友曾自豪地将她介绍给他。这一形象模糊成了一段记忆，他的船员们在北极发现了一个漂流的幽灵。在返回家园的途中，她困扰着船上的每一个人，他们都害怕直视她那空洞的眼睛。她的眼中失去了光彩，这过早地夺走了任何孩子应有的纯真。他看到的唯一区别是那副成熟的假面，那光芒想必从未回归。

"Dr. Ikari?' “碇博士？”

Gendo's ears twitched as he could only slightly turn away due to his bandages.  
Gendo 的耳朵微微一动，由于绷带的束缚，他只能略微转过头。

"Did you… know my father?"  
“你……认识我父亲吗？”

Asuka, having coaxed Tadeo away from the wall with a piece of string, listened to the two.  
明日香用一根细绳将塔德奥从墙边引开，聆听着两人的对话。

He nodded his head, "Good man… Good man." Gendo turned away, towards the glaring window.  
他点点头，“好人……好人。”源堂转身，面向那扇透着刺眼光线的窗户。

Misato forced another smile, a pressed toothless one, "You really had everyone worried there, Doctor Ikari. I heard you got very lucky."  
美里勉强挤出一个微笑，没有牙齿的那种，“真让大家都担心了，碇医生。听说你非常幸运。”

"That's right, Father. What on earth were you thinking?" Shinji added. "You could've gotten yourself killed, what was so important that you had to bust out?"  
“没错，父亲。你到底在想什么？”真嗣补充道，“你可能会丧命的，有什么事情那么重要非得逃出去？”

Gendo, his arms and forehead bandaged, laid perfectly still as he considered for a moment. "Hr. Thirsee."  
碇源堂，手臂和额头都缠着绷带，静静地躺着思考了一会儿。“哼，十三号。”

"Thirsty? I could get him some-" Misato stood up and offered.  
"口渴吗？我可以给他拿点——" 美里站起身来提议道。

Shinji sighed, "Not that kind of thirsty. He wants alcohol, which the doctors _explicitly_ told you would set back your treatments!"  
真嗣叹了口气，"不是那种口渴。他是想要酒，医生明明明确告诉过你，这会拖延你的治疗进程！"

"Bah." "哼。"

Misato patted his shoulder, "Look, Shinji, your father has an addiction, he can't help it. Mr. Ikari, your son works really hard for your insurance, to get you the help you need." She pumped up her fist encouragingly. "You should give everything you have to cut back-"  
美里拍了拍他的肩膀，“听着，真嗣，你父亲有瘾，他控制不了。碇先生，你儿子为了你的保险，为了你能得到帮助，真的很努力。”她鼓励地挥了挥拳头。“你应该全力以赴去戒掉——”

"-Oh, you're one to talk?"  
“——哦，你倒是说得轻巧？”

Misato whipped back to Asuka, "Shut it!" She sharply exhaled, "I'll have you know I'm four weeks sober."  
美里猛地转向明日香，“闭嘴！”她尖锐地呼出一口气，“我可是已经戒酒四周了。”

"Yeah right." "得了吧。"

"It's true." Shinji added.  
"这是真的。" 真嗣补充道。"

"Pfft." "噗。"

Misato let out a sigh, "Anyways, I'm glad we finally got to meet, your son has a very good head on his shoulders. You should be proud of him. He's one hell of a pilot."  
美里叹了口气，"总之，很高兴我们终于见面了，你儿子很有头脑，你应该为他感到骄傲。他是个非常出色的驾驶员。"

Gendo looked down to Asuka for confirmation, who wobbled her hand side to side debatably, to which he raised an eyebrow.  
源渡低头向明日香寻求确认，她犹豫地左右摇了摇手，这让他挑起了眉毛。

"Also…" Misato fished through her purse and pulled out a blue folder with Shinji's name on it. "This is your son's quarterly report! I thought you'd like to read it."  
“还有……”美里在她的手提包里翻找，拿出一个蓝色文件夹，上面写着真嗣的名字。“这是你儿子的季度报告！我想你会想看看。”

She handed the paper to Gendo who squinted at the papers, he looked at Misato, unsure what she expected him to do with the thing. He nonchalantly dropped it on his night-stand.  
她把文件递给源渡，他眯着眼睛看了一会儿，然后看向美里，不确定她希望他怎么处理这东西。他漫不经心地把它丢在了床头柜上。

"One more thing, Dr. Ikari…"  
"还有件事，碇博士……"

"Yesh?' "啥？"

Misato winced, "I'm gonna be going out of town for an important conference, can you watch the kids while I stop by HQ to sort things out first? I'll be back in an hour."  
美里皱了皱眉，"我得去外地参加一个重要会议，你能在我先去总部处理一些事情的时候帮忙照看一下孩子们吗？我一个小时后就回来。"

Gendo let out a groan but eventually nodded.  
源度发出一声呻吟，但最终点了点头。

Misato continued. "And then I'll come back and pick you up, Asuka."  
美里继续说道：“然后我会回来接你，明日香。”

Shinji's eyes widened in realization, "Oh, wait! There's someone else I want you to meet."  
真嗣的眼睛因领悟而睁大，“哦，等等！还有一个人我想让你见见。”

"Hr…" Gendo growled warningly.  
"哼…" 源渡警告性地低吼道。

"Please father? I promise it isn't anyone you used to work with."  
"求你了，父亲？我保证不是你以前工作上的任何人。"

"...Hr." Gendo growled approvingly.  
"...哼。" 源渡满意地哼了一声。

Shinji gave a hopeful smile, "Thank you!"  
真嗣露出了充满希望的微笑，“谢谢你！”  
He opened the door and wandered out, and quietly he said under his breath,  
他打开门，漫步出去，低声自语道，  
"Now or never…" his footsteps faded away.  
“现在或永不…”他的脚步声渐渐远去。

Asuka at Misato quizzically, who only offered a shrug in response.  
明日香疑惑地看着美里，后者只是耸了耸肩作为回应。

Gendo also peered around the edge of the door to see who else was visiting him. He could hear another pair of lighter footsteps alongside Shinji's. He couldn't make out the voice, if they even spoke at all, but his eyes widened as he heard his son speak to the person.  
碇源堂也透过门缝窥视，想知道还有谁来探望他。他能听到另一对较轻的脚步声与真嗣的脚步声并行。他听不出那声音是否在说话，但当听到儿子与那人交谈时，他的眼睛睁大了。

"Yes, it's an order." The two entered the dark room. "Sorry that it's so dark."  
“是的，这是命令。”两人走进了昏暗的房间。“抱歉这里这么暗。”

"I prefer it." A soft voice responded.  
"我更喜欢这样。" 一个柔和的声音回应道。

They stepped closer to Gendo as he tried his hardest to back away without injuring himself.  
他们向源渡靠近，而他则尽力在不伤害自己的情况下向后退。

"Well, that's him, that's my father."  
"好吧，那就是他，我的父亲。"

The silhouetted girl turned to Shinji, her soft voice cut into his ears, "From before. The parking lot."  
那剪影中的女孩转向真嗣，她柔和的声音刺入他的耳中，“从之前开始。停车场。”

"Ah, yeah. That's why I said we were going to the hospital, remember? He hit his head pretty bad."  
“啊，对。所以我才说我们要去医院，记得吗？他头部伤得很重。”

"He told you like, three times on the way here. God you've been so spaced out today. More the usual." Asuka spoke from below, still playing with Tadeo.  
“他一路上跟你说了三次。天啊，你今天真是心不在焉。比平时还严重。”明日香从下方说道，仍在逗弄着塔德奥。

The girl continued to stare at Gendo, her hair was tied together in a scraped together ponytail. He couldn't see the details of her face, the sun shone almost transparently through the ghost, and he couldn't make direct eye contact. She stepped closer to the light and her dull ruby eyed gaze couldn't be avoided.  
女孩继续盯着源度，她的头发随意扎成了一个马尾。他看不清她的面容细节，阳光几乎透过了她的身影，让他无法直接对视。她向光线靠近，那双暗淡的红眸凝视无法回避。

Shinji hesitantly stood alongside her, and wiped his brow. "Father? This is Rei, remember?"  
真嗣犹豫地站在她旁边，擦了擦额头。“父亲？这是绫波，记得吗？”

Gendo's brow furrowed together and twitched. His lips trembled as he stared at her, utterly paralyzed, he shook.  
源度的眉头紧皱并抽搐了一下。他的嘴唇颤抖着凝视她，完全僵住了，他颤抖着。

Rei stared through his soul and tilted her head, she approached trepidatiously, like a small child would. "...Are you okay?"  
丽透过他的灵魂凝视，微微歪着头，她小心翼翼地靠近，就像一个小孩子那样。“……你还好吗？”

Gendo's eyes began to well up as his face began to wobble and contort.  
源度的眼睛开始湿润，他的脸开始颤抖并扭曲。

"Well, Father? Aren't you going to say something?"  
“那么，父亲？你不想说点什么吗？”

---

Gendo's nurse held a box tightly in her hands and her body trembled, she followed Naoko down the hall. "You're… firing me?"  
源度的护士紧握着手中的盒子，身体微微颤抖，她跟着直子沿着走廊走。“你……是要解雇我吗？”

"Of course not. I'm having you relocated back to Atami. That's where you come from, right?"  
“当然不是。我安排你调回热海。你不是从那里来的吗？”

"But… but…" “但是……但是……”

"But-but what?" "但——但是什么？"

The nurse sweated profusely, "I just uprooted my whole life moving here, my daughter had to change schools, I can't miss work, I'm-I'm behind on payments."  
护士满头大汗，"我刚为了搬到这里放弃了整个生活，我女儿不得不转学，我不能缺勤，我——我还有贷款没还。"

The Commander offered a flat, sympathetic smile, "You're starting tomorrow, I'll have somebody make the arrangements."  
指挥官露出一个平淡而同情的微笑，"你明天就开始上班，我会让人安排好一切。"

Nurse Sato nearly tripped as her mind raced , "I have to find a hotel, and-and call a babysitter…"  
护士佐藤差点绊倒，脑海中急速想着，“我得找个酒店，然后——然后打电话找保姆……”

"Oh… you should probably get started then." Naoko looked behind her and walked faster to leave her in the dust.  
“哦……那你应该开始行动了。”直子回头看了一眼，加快脚步，把她甩在了身后。

"Ms- Commander, Commander, please wait!"  
“指挥官，指挥官，请稍等！”

Naoko stopped in her place and turned to face her with an expectant look.  
直子停下脚步，转过身来，脸上带着期待的表情。

Sato looked down at the box, the young Nurse was about the same height as Naoko, but her stature was crumpled. "I think this is all just all a big misunderstanding. I'm sorry that I disrespected you, my intentions-"  
佐藤低头看着盒子，这位年轻护士的身高与直子相仿，但她的姿态显得有些萎靡。“我想这一切可能都是个大误会。我很抱歉之前对您不敬，我的意图——”

"-You're right, there was a misunderstanding. You've been working a job not suited for you. Trust me, you shouldn't be in Tokyo-03. I'll need you to leave immediately to avoid complications."  
“——你说得对，这是个误会。你一直在做不适合你的工作。相信我，你不应该待在东京-03。为了避免更多麻烦，我需要你立刻离开。”

Mrs. Sato looked down in defeat. "My husband has the car and he's out of the city, and the scooter…" She gestured behind her.  
佐藤太太垂头丧气地看着地面。“我丈夫开车出城了，而那辆摩托车……”她指了指身后。

"I know." Naoko offered a grim attempt at a sympathetic wince. "I'll give you a number for a rental."  
“我知道。”直子勉强挤出一个同情的表情。“我给你一个租车公司的电话。”

The two heard garbled roars spill out from the end of the hall and froze. Naoko smiled as Nurse Sato gasped, "He's…."  
两人听到走廊尽头传来含糊的咆哮声，顿时僵住了。直子微笑着，佐藤护士倒吸一口气，“他……”

"No longer your concern." Naoko stared at the box Mrs. Sato held. "I'll take that."  
"不再是你的事了。" 直子盯着佐藤夫人手中的盒子。"我来拿吧。"

Mrs. Sato watched in disbelief as Naoko eagerly strolled ahead, she heard the Commander faintly hum and mutter to herself in the distance.  
佐藤夫人难以置信地看着直子急切地向前走去，她听到指挥官在远处隐约地哼唱并自言自语。

---

"Ough! Geh Ough!" Gendo roared at Rei, he reached for the papers Misato gave him from and threw the folder at her, even scrunching up some of the loose papers into balls.  
"呃！咳呃！" 源堂对着丽咆哮，他从美里给他的文件中伸手抓起文件夹扔向她，甚至把一些散落的纸张揉成团。

"Dr. Ikari, pull yourself together!" Misato attempted to bat away the oncoming projectiles. The sharp end of the folder scratched her face, down the nose.  
"碇博士，振作点！" 美里试图挡开迎面而来的文件。文件的尖角划过她的脸颊，沿着鼻梁留下痕迹。

"Have you lost your mind father? Stop it!" Shinji tried his best to hold back Gendo's unbroken wrist without hurting him.  
"父亲，你疯了吗？住手！" 真嗣尽力在不伤害他的情况下抓住了碇源堂未受伤的手腕。

"I told you he was a psycho!" Asuka called out from the corner, Tadeo clung to her claws and all, both hid away from the line of fire.  
"我早说过他是疯子！" 明日香从角落里喊道，塔德奥紧抓着她的爪子，两人都躲开了交火线。

Rei stood behind them but none of the objects came close to hitting her, still she recoiled and backed away further out the door.  
丽站在他们身后，但没有任何物体靠近她，尽管如此，她还是退缩了，进一步退出门外。

"Bitch! Dog! Geh ough!" “婊子！狗！呸！”

"How could you say that!?"  
“你怎么能这么说！？”

A voice spoke close to Gendo's ear, nobody heard her enter. "What's going on here?" A desk lamp was clicked on the corner of his eye.  
一个声音贴近了源渡的耳边响起，没人注意到她是什么时候进来的。“这里发生了什么？”一盏台灯在他眼角被按亮。

Gendo's arm froze at the sound of Naoko's voice and he turned to look at her. He gawked at her, but she ignored him and looked at Shinji for answers.  
听到直子的声音，源渡的手臂僵住了，他转头看向她。他惊讶地瞪着她，但她无视了他，转而向真嗣寻求答案。

"I am so sorry about that Commander." Misato offered.  
“对此我非常抱歉，指挥官。”美里说道。

"Don't apologize for him!" Shinji shouted, "Ms. Naoko-"  
"别为他道歉！" 真嗣喊道，"直子老师——"

Naoko held her hand up. She looked directly at Gendo, and gestured to Rei, "Is she bothering you?"  
直子举起手。她直视着源堂，并示意丽，"她打扰到你了吗？"

No doubt everyone inside the room, and anyone else who could've walked in as well would easily have seen Gendo for what he truly was, a miserable, spiteful monster. But all that Gendo could see was the four year old child he and his wife created beyond the means of nature. The one that he abandoned. The one that he must keep abandoning.  
毫无疑问，房间里的每个人，以及任何可能走进来的人，都能轻易看穿源堂的真面目，一个可悲、恶毒的怪物。但在源堂眼中，他只能看到那个四岁的孩子，那个他和妻子以非自然手段创造出来的孩子。那个他抛弃了的孩子。那个他必须不断抛弃的孩子。

He looked away from the others and nodded, his expression wobbled.  
他避开其他人的目光，点了点头，表情有些动摇。

Naoko glanced at Rei and nodded at her, and she quickly left the room. She held a hand up to stop Shinji from following. "Let her be."  
直子瞥了丽一眼，向她点头示意，她迅速离开了房间。她举起一只手阻止真嗣跟随。“让她静一静。”

Shinji looked down in defeat as Gendo panted and gulped for air.  
真嗣垂头丧气地低下头，而源堂则喘着粗气，大口吸气。

Swiftly, Naoko pulled him in her embrace, "Oh Shinji, I know. Believe me, I know. Hey." She held his shoulders and shrugged, "Don't worry about him, he's just a cranky old man."  
迅速地，直子将他拥入怀中，“哦，真嗣，我知道。相信我，我知道。嘿。”她握住他的肩膀耸了耸肩，“别担心他，他只是个脾气暴躁的老头。”

"You didn't hear what he said, it was horrible, I just wanted to-"  
“你没听到他说了什么，太可怕了，我只是想——”

"Nhever bringh that bitch here again." Gendo growled at Shinji. "Nhever."  
“再也不要把那个婊子带到这里来。”源堂对真嗣咆哮道，“再也不要。”

He hid his face from the others and ran out of the hospital room.  
他避开众人的目光，冲出了病房。

"Shinji!" Misato called out, and Naoko stopped her from following.  
"真嗣！" 美里喊道，直子拦住了她，不让她追出去。

"Let him be. We have a big day today and no time at all." Naoko looked at Asuka, who had her hands in her pockets in the corner of the room, her eyes shifted to the bed. Naoko turned to Gendo and smiled. "Well, maybe a little."  
"让他静一静吧。我们今天有很多事要做，一点时间都没有。" 直子看着角落里的明日香，她双手插在口袋里，目光转向了床铺。直子转向碇源堂，微微一笑。"嗯，或许稍稍有点时间。"

She stepped closer to approach him, and his eyes met everywhere but her own. Naoko stared at him blankly. Then she smiled.  
她走近他，他的目光却四处游离，唯独不敢直视她的眼睛。直子面无表情地盯着他，随后微微一笑。

"Hi, Do-do." “嗨，多多。”

---

Shinji stormed down the halls, he furiously wiped the pouring sweat off his forehead.  
真嗣怒气冲冲地穿过走廊，愤愤地擦去额头上的汗水。

"Son!" Fuyutsuki's voice called out. "Wait!"  
"儿子！" 冬月喊道。"等等！"

He turned back around to see the older man hobbling in an attempt to catch up with him and instantly stood in place. Shinji couldn't meet his questioning eyes but waited for him nonetheless.  
他转过身，看到那位年长者正一瘸一拐地试图追上他，立刻停下了脚步。真嗣无法直视他询问的目光，但还是等待着。

Fuyutsuki caught his breath by leaning against a nearby wall. Nurses, doctors and other unwelcome ears passed by them en masse, so he led Shinji to a nearby hallway. "I… heard what happened." He waited for a response, but Shinji looked away and offered him none. "We spoke about this…"  
冬月靠在附近的墙上喘了口气。护士、医生和其他不受欢迎的旁听者大批经过他们，于是他带着真嗣走到附近的一条走廊。"我……听说了发生的事。"他等待着回应，但真嗣别过头去，没有给他任何答复。"我们谈过这个……"

"When I saw him outside school this morning… I was so embarrassed that I didn't tell anyone. But now-I shouldn't be surprised. I couldn't take it anymore, Mr. Fuyutsuki. I thought if he saw her, that maybe it would… I don't know."  
"今早我在学校外面看到他时……我太尴尬了，没告诉任何人。但现在——我不该感到惊讶的。我再也受不了了，冬月先生。我想如果他见到她，也许会……我不知道。"

"-All it brought were painful memories for him. I told you it would be wise to wait."  
"——这只会勾起他痛苦的回忆。我告诉过你，等待是明智的。"

Shinji finally looked up at him, "Wait? Wait for what? Answer's that I'm never going to hear? I don't even know what's the secret I'm supposed to keep!"  
真嗣终于抬头看着他，“等待？等待什么？答案是我永远听不到的吗？我甚至不知道我该保守什么秘密！”

Fuyutsuki anxiously looked behind him, "Please, keep your voice-"  
冬月焦急地回头看了一眼，"请您小声点——"

"I know, Mr. Fuyutsuki, I know. but it's been three months since you told me Rei was related to me, and you promised you'd tell me more!"  
"我知道，冬月先生，我知道。但自从您三个月前告诉我绫波和我有关系，并且承诺会告诉我更多之后，已经过去三个月了！"

"It's not that simple… and those were not my exact words."  
"事情没那么简单……而且那也不是我的原话。"

"Then what is it?" Shinji paced around the narrow hallway but Fuyutsuki said nothing, "Please I can't take this anymore, I need to know! I promised I wouldn't tell Naoko or- or anyone else and I meant it! Please…"  
"那它到底是什么？" 真嗣在狭窄的走廊里来回踱步，但副司令福音津木一言不发，"求您了，我再也受不了了，我必须知道！我答应过不会告诉直子或者其他人，我是认真的！请您……"

Shinji looked desperately for a change in Fuyutsuki's resolve, and the warm grandfather he once knew seemed to fade more into a stranger with every passing second.  
真嗣绝望地寻找着福音津木态度的转变，曾经那位温暖如祖父的他，每过一秒都变得更加陌生。

Eventually, he slumped down the wall in defeat and covered his head. "I just came because I thought I had family here, that someone needed me to be here, to protect them…"  
最终，他无力地靠着墙滑坐下来，双手抱头。"我只是以为这里有我的家人，有人需要我在这里，保护他们……"

Fuyutsuki placed his hand on Shinji's shoulder, "You are needed here. More than you could know."  
冬月将手放在真嗣的肩上，“这里需要你。比你想象的还要多。”

"Am I? All I'm doing is getting on everyone's nerves, like Langley. And if Rei is nobody to me then… I have no reason to be here anymore." Shinji sniffed and nodded to himself as he sat back up. "I'm sorry that I wasted your time. After Langley gets back from the conference, I… I think that I'll talk to-"  
“是吗？我所做的只是惹恼每个人，就像兰利一样。如果丽对我来说什么都不是，那么……我没有理由再留在这里了。”真嗣吸了吸鼻子，自顾自地点头坐直了身子。“对不起，浪费了你的时间。等兰利从会议回来后，我……我想我会去谈谈——”

"Wait." Fuyutsuki held his hand up to block Shinji from leaving. "You're right. I have kept you in the dark. I did it to protect you, and Rei as well but… If it is causing you this much pain, then perhaps it is time."  
“等等。”冬月举起手阻止真嗣离开。“你说得对。我一直让你蒙在鼓里。我这样做是为了保护你，还有丽，但……如果这给你带来如此多的痛苦，那么也许现在是时候了。”

Much to the guilting naw inside Fuyutsuki's stomach, Shinji's blue eyes shimmered with hope again. "You mean it?"  
"尽管腹中满是愧疚，但真嗣的蓝眼睛再次闪烁着希望的光芒。“你是说真的吗？””

Fuyutsuki nodded at him. 冬月朝他点了点头。

A smile grew on Shinji's face, "No more secrets?"  
"真嗣的脸上绽放出笑容，“不再有秘密了？””

"...Yes." "...是的。"

---

"And- and then the LCL container broke and nearly flooded the entire room!" Naoko let out a shrill laugh and leaned on Gendo's arm. He let out a rattled, odd chuckle as Misato and Asuka hesitantly joined.  
“然后——然后那个 LCL 容器破了，差点淹了整个房间！”直子尖声笑道，靠在源堂的胳膊上。他发出一阵颤抖的、古怪的笑声，美里和明日香犹豫地跟着笑了起来。

Asuka and Misato had absolutely zero time to process the visceral family feud that exploded in front of them as Naoko sat comfortably next to Gendo and quickly took over the conversation. Without any form of catch-up, she reminisced with Gendo on a story of their old days at Gehirn.

Naoko rubbed at her dry eyes and chuckled again, she still wore her large violet sleeveless vest, completely unbothered by the heat. "My, my, those were the days." She let out a disappointed sigh. "It's a shame what happened to you, Gendo, we could've been running the whole world at this rate."  
直子揉了揉干涩的眼睛，又笑了起来，她依然穿着那件宽大的紫色无袖背心，丝毫不受炎热影响。“哎呀，那些日子真是美好。”她失望地叹了口气，“真可惜你变成了这样，源堂，我们本可以按这个速度掌控整个世界的。”

Gendo let out another rattled chuckle and nodded, "Yesh. Yesh."  
源度又发出一阵颤抖的轻笑，点头道：“是的，是的。”

Misato's eyes darted between the two, her arms crossed. "I take it you two were… close?"  
美里目光在两人之间来回扫视，双臂交叉。“我猜你们俩曾经……很亲密？”

"What do you mean 'close'? As in…" Naoko's eyes widened in realization and she gagged, "Not like that! Goodness Misato, he and his wife used to be my students!"  
“你说的‘亲密’是什么意思？就像……”直子眼睛睁大，恍然大悟，随即作呕，“不是那样的！天啊，美里，他和他的妻子曾经是我的学生！”

"Oh…" Misato rubbed the back of her head, "I didn't mean to… just how it looked."  
"哦…" 美里揉了揉后脑勺，"我不是故意的…只是看起来那样。"

Naoko held her hands up, "It's been a long time and I'm a little eager to see a familiar face, I'll admit that, but we're just old friends, right Do-do?" She smiled at him.  
直子举起双手，"已经很久没见了，我承认我有点急于见到熟悉的面孔，但我们只是老朋友，对吧，多多？" 她朝他微笑。

Gendo nodded quickly and let out a half-toothed smile, "Yesh. Jus ol frienss"  
碇源堂迅速点头，露出一丝半齿的笑容，"是的。只是老朋友"

"Purely professional." Naoko shrugged, "Still, I know the old coot better than he knows himself." She reached into her coat's inner pocket and produced a flask, "Thirsty? It's gin." She noticed Misato's raised eyebrow, "Now look at me. The pot calling the kettle black." Naoko giggled. "Now you know why I'm so easy on you."  
"纯粹是职业性的。" 直子耸了耸肩，"不过，我可比那老头子还了解他自己。" 她伸手从外套的内袋里掏出一个扁酒壶，"口渴吗？是杜松子酒。" 她注意到美里挑起的眉毛，"现在看看我，真是五十步笑百步。" 直子咯咯笑了起来。"现在你知道我为什么对你这么宽容了吧。"

She looked back at Gendo and swished the flask. "Thirsty?"  
她回头看向源堂，晃了晃手中的酒壶。"口渴吗？"

Gendo looked for a moment at the flask, and then at her. He shook his head and gently pushed the flask away.  
源堂先是看了一眼酒壶，然后又看向她。他摇了摇头，轻轻地把酒壶推开。

Naoko stood up triumphantly, "Aha! See? You can change, mister." She pointed a finger at him, like a teacher letting a child off the hook, "Now be nicer to your son! And to Rei. It's not her fault the MAGI chose her over your own candidate, but that's who they gave us, better to let it go!"  
直子得意地站起身，“啊哈！看吧？你也能改变的，先生。”她用手指着他，就像老师放学生一马一样，“现在对你的儿子好一点！还有丽。MAGI 选择了她而不是你的候选人，这不是她的错，但这就是他们给我们的结果，最好还是放下吧！”

Gendo gulped and nodded. 源堂咽了口唾沫，点了点头。

Misato looked back at the exit and gestured to the way Rei left, "So that's what that was about?"  
美里回头看向出口，指着丽离开的方向，“所以这就是刚才那件事的原因？”

"Oh yes." Naoko nodded. "Really Gendo, grudges are beneath a man like you. It's just a shame Shinji got dragged into this whole misunderstanding." Her smile dropped and she stared at Gendo. "Best that it's water under the bridge."  
"哦，是的。" 直子点头道，"源堂，像你这样的人不该被怨恨所困。只是可怜真嗣被卷入这场误会。" 她的笑容消失了，盯着源堂，"最好让它随风而去。"

The two stared at each other as Misato could no longer stand being the spectator of this odd exchange. "Speaking of Shinji, I'm worried about him, we should check on him before we go."  
两人对视着，美里再也忍受不了这种奇怪的交流。"说到真嗣，我很担心他，我们走之前应该去看看他。"

"Agreed!" Naoko hummed and she swept invisible dust off her vest, "We really need to do this again, Gendo, we have so much to catch up on."  
"同意！" 直子哼了一声，拍了拍并不存在的灰尘，"我们真的需要再聚聚，源堂，我们有很多事情要聊。"

Gendo remained silent. 源度保持沉默。

"Come on, girls!" Naoko led them out the door and waited until she was the last one left.  
“快点，姑娘们！”直子领着她们走出门口，直到自己是最后一个才停下。

She turned around and stared at Gendo.  
她转过身，盯着源度。

He looked away. 他移开了视线。

Naoko wrapped her fingers around the door frame. "I just want to say that you should be very proud of your son, and that he is in excellent hands now."  
直子用手指紧抓着门框。“我只是想说，你应该为你的儿子感到非常骄傲，现在他得到了极好的照顾。”

The new Commander walked out of the room and the door slammed shut, leaving Gendo Ikari alone in the dark hospital room.  
新任指挥官走出了房间，门砰的一声关上，留下源堂·碇独自一人在昏暗的病房里。

Gendo stared at his tremoring, gnarled hands and shoved them into his face. He curled into a ball, grabbed fistfuls of his hair as he writhed and whimpered, but the sounds never passed the metal doors.  
源度盯着他颤抖的、扭曲的双手，将它们埋进脸庞。他蜷缩成一团，紧抓着头发，扭动着身体，发出呜咽声，但这些声音从未穿过那扇金属门。

Tadeo, finally feeling the old danger left the room, jumped on the bed and sniffed Gendo's hands.  
塔德奥终于感觉到旧日的危险离开了房间，跳上床，嗅了嗅源度的手。

---

The three women walked down the busy hall, away from the dark clouds of Gendo's hospital room and back into the unforgiving heat the afternoon radiated.  
三位女士沿着繁忙的走廊走去，远离源度病房里那片阴暗的云层，回到了午后无情的热浪中。

"Did you see what I did there?" Naoko said to Asuka and Misato who followed behind her, "I threw him off course with that story."  
"你们看到我刚才那招了吗？" 直子对跟在身后的明日香和美里说，"我用那个故事把他引开了。"

Misato, still left in utter confusion tilted her head, "I suppose."  
美里依旧一头雾水，歪着头说："我想是吧。"

"Trust me." Naoko replied. "I'm not impressed with Gendo's behavior either, but I did it for Shinji's sake."  
"相信我。" 直子回答，"我也不喜欢碇源堂的行为，但我是为了真嗣好。"

"You did?" “你做了？”

Naoko nodded as she scanned the halls, "There you are! You two wait here." Shinji was with Fuyutsuki in a lone hallway, the two froze at the sight of her, a fawn and an old stag caught in the headlights. "What are you two talking about?" She approached them.  
直子点点头，一边扫视着走廊，“找到你们了！你们俩在这儿等着。”真嗣和冬月在一个偏僻的走廊里，两人一见到她便僵住了，宛如被车灯照到的鹿和年迈的雄鹿。“你们俩在聊什么？”她向他们走去。

Fuyutsuki regained his composure and held his hands behind his back, "Just debriefing him on what he needs to do. Commander."  
冬月恢复了镇定，将双手背在身后，“只是向他简要说明他需要做的事情。指挥官。”

"I see." Naoko squinted at Fuyutsuki but offered a sympathetic pout for Shinji, "Oh, Shinji…"  
"我明白了。" 直子眯眼看着冬月，却对真嗣露出了同情的撅嘴，"哦，真嗣……"

Shinji held her hands up to stop her from another embrace. "It's alright Naoko, I feel better now."  
真嗣举起双手阻止她再次拥抱。"没事的，直子，我现在感觉好多了。"

"Oh." Naoko looked at Fuyutsuki, "I suppose I have you to thank for that."  
"哦。" 直子看向冬月，"我想我得感谢你。"

Fuyutsuki stared blankly at her and walked past, "I'll get the car running."  
冬月面无表情地盯着她，然后走过，“我去把车发动起来。”

Naoko nodded at him. "Good man. Are you sure you're alright, Shinji?"  
直子对他点点头。“好样的。你确定你没事吗，真嗣？”

He shrugged, "It's like what you said. He's just a cranky old man. Just who he is."  
他耸耸肩，“就像你说的那样。他只是个脾气暴躁的老头。他就是那样的人。”

Naoko offered a hopeful smile. "Well… Maybe one day he'll change and be… you know."  
直子带着希望的微笑说：“嗯……也许有一天他会改变，变得……你知道的。”

Shinji looked up at her, "Like the stories you told me?"  
真嗣抬头看着她，“就像你给我讲的故事那样？”

She nodded, "Your father used to be a great man. NERV wouldn't be where it is now without him…" Naoko looked down and sighed, still she held her smile tightly. "It's just a shame what happened to him."  
她点点头，“你父亲曾经是个伟大的人。没有他，NERV 不会发展到今天这个地步……”直子低头叹息，尽管如此，她依然紧紧保持着微笑。“只是可惜他后来变成了那样。”

"His Doctor said he refused to do any therapy or treatments, but…" Shinji's eyes lit up,  
"他的医生说他拒绝接受任何治疗或疗法，但是……" 真嗣的眼睛一亮，  
"Maybe if I could change his mind and he got better, he could help you! Y'know, at NERV."  
"如果我能说服他改变主意并康复，他就能帮你了！你知道的，在 NERV。"

Naoko's smile dropped instantly, "What makes you think I need his help?"  
直子瞬间收起了笑容，"你凭什么认为我需要他的帮助？"

"W-what?" "什-什么？"

"Are you saying I can't do this on my own?" Naoko took a step closer to him.  
"你是说我不能自己搞定吗？" 直子向他走近了一步。

"N-no! That's not what I meant, just… help, I don't know… I'm sorry."  
"不，不！我不是那个意思，只是……帮忙，我不确定……对不起。"

"You should be." "你确实应该道歉。"

"I just wanted to help…" Shinji looked down, and as quickly as his second wind arrived, it was deflated.  
"我只是想帮忙……" 真嗣低下头，他的第二股劲儿来得快，去得也快。

"Hold the fort. That's all the help I need." She patted his shoulder sharply, "Can I count on that?"  
"守住这里。这就是我需要的帮助。" 她用力拍了拍他的肩膀，"我能指望你吗？"

"...Yes, Naoko." "……是的，直子。"

"Attaboy!" Naoko scanned Shinji's face and frowned when she realized he wasn't inspired. "Hey." He looked up. "Today's gonna be a _great_ day. Okay? Feeling better?"  
"好样的！" 直子扫了一眼真嗣的脸，发现他没有受到鼓舞，皱起了眉头。"嘿。" 他抬起头来。"今天会是个好日子。好吗？感觉好点了吗？"

Shinji stuffed hands in his pockets, offered a flat smile and nodded.  
真嗣把手插进口袋，挤出一个勉强的微笑，点了点头。

"Great!" Naoko stared at her watch and winced, she slowly backed away from Shinji, "I gotta run, me and Misato will pick up Asuka on the roof in one hour, okay? Ciao!"  
"太好了！" 直子盯着她的手表，皱了皱眉，慢慢地从真嗣身边退开，"我得走了，我和美里一个小时后会在屋顶接明日香，好吗？再见！"

The Commander eagerly strode out the narrow hallway, where Misato and Asuka waited at the end.  
指挥官急切地走出狭窄的走廊，米萨托和明日香在尽头等待着。

"Is he okay?" Misato asked.  
“他没事吧？”米萨托问道。

Naoko waved a hand in dismissal, "He's fine, we should get going!" She turned to Asuka, "I'll be picking you up-"  
直子挥手表示不必担心，“他很好，我们该出发了！”她转向明日香，“我会来接你——”

"-In an hour by the roof." Asuka repeated with her hands behind her back.  
"-一小时后在屋顶见。" 明日香重复道，双手背在身后。

"Attagirl." "好样的。"

Asuka realized something, "Wait, I only got my uniform, maybe you should pick me up at my place so I can change?"  
明日香意识到什么，"等等，我只带了制服，也许你应该到我家接我，这样我可以换衣服？"

Naoko grinned at her, "Nice try! I have an outfit ready for you on the plane."  
直子对她咧嘴一笑，"想得美！我在飞机上已经为你准备好了衣服。"

"...Great!" Asuka smiled, "See you in an hour!" She called out to Naoko as she walked away briskly.  
"...太好了！" 明日香微笑着，"一小时后见！" 她朝着快步走开的直子喊道。

Misato looked down the narrow hallway Shinji hid in, his white shirt made him blend into the walls and the nearby plastic tree, as his head leaned right next to it. "Ah, Naoko? I'll go say something to him."  
美里沿着狭窄的走廊看向真嗣躲藏的地方，他的白衬衫让他与墙壁和附近的塑料树融为一体，头正好靠在树旁。"啊，直子？我去跟他说几句话。"

"Might be your last chance!" Naoko called back.  
"可能是你最后的机会了！" 直子回头喊道。

Before Misato entered the hallway, she glanced at Asuka, who leaned against the corner of the wall with her arms crossed, "Give us a moment, okay?"  
在进入走廊之前，美里瞥了一眼明日香，她正双臂交叉靠在墙角，“给我们一点时间，好吗？”

"Fine, whatever. I don't care."  
“好吧，随便。我不在乎。”

Misato sighed and continued down the hall, Shinji was at the end, his head slumped against the wall.  
美里叹了口气，继续沿着走廊走去，真嗣在尽头，头靠在墙上垂着。

Unsure of what to say, Misato mimicked him a few feet away and didn't say a word until he eventually cracked and side-eyed her. Misato cramped. "Oh sorry, am I cramping your style?"  
"不确定该说什么，Misato 在几英尺外模仿他的沉默，直到他最终忍不住斜眼瞥了她一眼。Misato 感到局促。“哦，抱歉，我是不是打扰了你的风格？””

"The wall feels cool." Shinji muttered back.  
“墙壁感觉凉凉的。”真嗣低声回应。

"I can see that." “我看得出来。”

"I'm fine, Misato, you should get going before Naoko leaves you behind."  
"我没事，美里，你该走了，不然直子会把你甩在后面的。"

"Hm, tempting, very tempting. Maybe I'd be dodging a big ol' bullet?" Misato offered an odd chuckle. "You know, you really impressed me with how you stood up to those nurses."  
"嗯，诱人，非常诱人。或许我是在避开一颗大子弹？"" 美里发出了一声奇怪的轻笑。""你知道吗，你面对那些护士时的表现真的让我印象深刻。"

Shinji broke out of his malaise and looked at Misato, "I did?"  
真嗣从恍惚中回过神来，看着美里，""我做到了？""

"Oh yeah, I think you impressed Asuka too-"  
"哦，我觉得你也给明日香留下了深刻印象——"

"Misato, please don't patronize me."  
"美里，请别用那种居高临下的态度对我说话。"

"I'm not! I always knew you had guts, but you finally confirmed it today." Misato punched his shoulder, "You're not that same kid I met three months ago. I'm proud of you."  
"我没有！我一直知道你有胆量，但今天你终于证明了这一点。" 美里捶了一下他的肩膀，"你不再是三个月前我遇到的那个孩子了。我为你感到骄傲。"

A small smile crept on Shinji's face as he finally lifted his head from the wall, "Thanks, Misato. Good luck at the conference."  
一丝微笑悄悄爬上真嗣的脸颊，他终于从墙边抬起头，“谢谢你，美里。祝你在会议上好运。”

Misato gave a reassuring wink to Shinji. "Hey, while me and Asuka are gone, you're the man of the house. Got it?"  
美里向真嗣投去一个安心的眨眼。“嘿，我和明日香不在的时候，你就是家里的男子汉了。明白吗？”

"Uh-" Shinji's eyes darted in an attempt to comprehend that logic. "Okay?"  
“呃——” 真嗣的眼睛四处游移，试图理解这个逻辑。“好吧？”

"Say it." "说出来。"

"...I'm the man of the house?"  
"……我是家里的顶梁柱？"

"Say it like you mean it!"  
"要带着决心说出来！"

"I'm- I'm the man of the house."  
"我——我是家里的顶梁柱。"

"Hell yeah!" Misato gave him a high-five, "That's the spirit!"  
"太棒了！" 美里与他击掌，"就是要这种精神！"

Shinji stood tall, his chest puffed out, fist on his hips, "I'm the man of the house!"  
真嗣挺直了腰板，胸膛挺起，双手叉腰，"我是家里的顶梁柱！"

At the corner of the hall, a loud, drawn out, wheezing laughter echoed to them, and Asuka leaned against the wall, clutching her ribs for dear life as she tried to breathe.  
在大厅的角落里，一阵响亮、拖长的喘息笑声回荡在他们耳边，明日香倚着墙，紧紧按住肋骨，拼命试图呼吸。

Shinji stared dead-pan at her, unamused. Misato pinched the bridge of her nose and sighed.  
真嗣面无表情地盯着她，毫无笑意。美里捏着鼻梁，叹了口气。

Asuka gasped for air and continued to cackle. "The- the man of the house!" She wheezed again and coughed as she wiped her mirthy eyes, "Man of the house!"  
明日香喘着气，继续咯咯笑道：“家——家的男人！”她又喘息一声，咳嗽着擦去笑出的眼泪，“家的男人！”

"Are you done!?" "你搞定了吗！？"

"Wait- wait, give me a second." Asuka looked at Shinji's still dead pan frown and instantly had to bite back a howl. "AH! Look at his face! Him!?"  
"等等——等等，给我一点时间。" 明日香看着真嗣依旧死气沉沉的皱眉，立刻咬紧牙关忍住一声嚎叫。"啊！看他的脸！他！？"

"Y-yeah, me! Deal with it!"  
"是-是的，我！接受现实吧！"

Asuka held up her hands mockingly and put on a deep voice, "Oh nooo, tough guy, don't shoot!"  
明日香举起双手嘲讽地模仿着低沉的嗓音，"哦不，硬汉，别开枪！"

"Will you stop!?" Misato snapped. She looked at her phone, "I gotta go. You two." She pointed at Asuka. "No…f-freaking fighting. Got it? Asuka, be nice to him, okay? Maybe, I don't know, play a video game with him or something."  
"你能不能停下！？"美里厉声道。她看了看手机，"我得走了。你们俩。"她指着明日香。"不许……胡闹打架。明白吗？明日香，对他好点，好吗？或许，我不知道，和他玩个电子游戏什么的。"

"Oh sure, I'll crack out my barbies, and we'll paint each other's finger nails too!"  
"哦当然，我会拿出我的芭比娃娃，我们还可以互相涂指甲油！"

"Okay, Asuka." She strode out of the hallway, Shinji and Asuka followed, not wanting to be caught alone in a confined space together. "Cya in an hour!" Misato called out.  
"好的，明日香。" 她大步走出走廊，真嗣和明日香紧随其后，不想在狭小空间里单独相处。"一小时后见！" 美里喊道。

"That's fifty-five minutes now!"  
"现在还有五十五分钟！"

"Shit!" Misato's footsteps quickened until they could not be heard among the constant sounds of business in the hospital.  
"该死！" 美里加快了脚步，直到她的脚步声在医院繁忙的嘈杂声中无法被听见。

Asuka and Shinji stood side by side. She crossed her arms. "Technically, she said I was the man of the house first. So ha! You like that?" Asuka pouted as she realized Shinji was miles away in thought.  
明日香和真嗣并肩而立。她交叉双臂。"从技术上讲，她先说我是家里的顶梁柱。所以哈！你没想到吧？" 明日香噘嘴时意识到真嗣正陷入沉思，心不在焉。  
"...I said- wait, why am I even trying to impress you? I have more important things to do."  
"...我说过——等等，我为什么要试图打动你？我有更重要的事情要做。"

She marched away from the still spaced out Shinji and gave a backwards glance at him. "Captain stuff! Secret Captain stuff!"  
她从依然神游天外的真嗣身边大步走开，回头瞥了他一眼。“队长的事！秘密队长的事！”

He ignored her. 他无视了她。

"...Tch." “...啧。”

---

Asuka poked her head under Gendo's bed, who didn't even notice her presence and searched for the cat, "Pst, Tadeo, you down here?"  
明日香探头到碇源堂的床下，他甚至没注意到她的存在，寻找着猫咪，“嘘，塔德奥，你在下面吗？”

"Meow." "喵。"

The gray tabby cat squinted at her suspiciously.  
那只灰色的虎斑猫怀疑地眯起眼睛盯着她。

"Don't worry. She's gone." Asuka looked at the cat, still hidden in the corner, knowing the cat wouldn't understand her, still realized she wouldn't get in trouble for telling the truth to deaf ears. "...She scares me too." Asuka frowned at the floor.  
"别担心。她已经走了。" 明日香看着那只仍躲在角落里的猫，明知它听不懂，却仍意识到对着聋子耳朵说真话不会惹麻烦。"...她也让我害怕。" 明日香皱着眉头看向地板。

Tadeo stared at her blankly, it was some comfort to Asuka that it couldn't understand a word of what she said, and that either way, it wouldn't really care. Forgiveness through indifference, she supposed.  
塔德奥茫然地盯着她，这让明日香感到些许安慰，因为它根本听不懂她的话，而且无论如何，它也不会真正在意。她想，这算是通过冷漠获得的原谅吧。

Asuka pulled a piece of string from her pocket, "Look what I found!" She whispered sharply, and thrashed it tauntingly, "And it's mine!"  
明日香从口袋里掏出一根细绳，“看我找到了什么！”她尖锐地低声说道，并挑衅地挥舞着它，“这是我的！”

Tadeo's eyes widened with a mix of excitement and annoyance as it swiped for the piece of string. Asuka chuckled as she watched the whimsical cat not have a worry in the world.  
塔德奥的眼睛因兴奋和恼怒而睁大，它试图去抓那根细绳。明日香看着这只无忧无虑的调皮猫，不禁轻笑出声。

Suddenly, she felt a tap on her shoulder, and she jolted and regrettably smacked the back of her head against the frame of the bed, "Ah, fuck! Shit!" She hissed and doubled over while clutching the back of her head, "Mother-fucking-shit!"  
突然，她感到有人拍了拍她的肩膀，她一惊，不慎将后脑勺猛地撞在了床架上，“啊，该死！见鬼！”她咬牙切齿地低声咒骂，双手紧抱头部，弯腰蹲下，“真他妈的见鬼！”

Another tap on the shoulder, "Engly." A garbled voice replied.  
又是一下轻拍肩膀，“Engly。”一个含糊不清的声音回应道。

She looked up at Gendo, "What gives old man!? I wasn't even being that loud-"  
她抬头看向碇源堂，“老先生，这是怎么回事？我根本没那么大声——”

Gendo held up a finger, "Sh-shuhup." He held a finger to his ear, "Engly."  
源度竖起一根手指，“嘘——嘘。”他将手指贴在耳边，“接通了。”

"What?" "什么？"

"Issen." Gendo charades as a person walking, and he walked the two fingers to his window, he opened the blinds of his window, not minding the intense heat and pointed to a building with a grunt. "Iquor store. Sakee."  
“一闪。”源度比划着走路的动作，用两根手指走到窗边，他拉开窗帘，不顾外面酷热，指着对面的一栋建筑哼了一声。“伊克索尔商店。清酒。”

"Eh?" Asuka looked out a window to see a liquor store directly across the street. "You want me to… buy you booze?"  
“嗯？”明日香望向窗外，看到街对面正是一家酒铺。“你是想让我……给你买酒？”

"Corregh." "科雷格。"

"Are you…are you retarded?" Asuka pointed at her school uniform. "Look at me!"  
"你是不是……你是不是智力有问题？" 明日香指着自己的校服。"看看我！"

"Bah Shih-hee hoo et erry ay!" Gendo pointed at her, "Anh yew EVA Piheh! Yew af moneh!"  
"巴 诗熙-熙 呼 诶 特 艾瑞 艾！" 源堂指着她，"安 哟 伊娃 皮赫！哟 艾夫 莫内！"

"Yeah, I have money. In a trust fund, dipshit!"  
“是啊，我有钱。在信托基金里，蠢货！”

Gendo let out a shout of dismay and punched his nightstand. He looked at the nightstand again and then, a light bulb went off. He grunted and fished through his nightstand's drawers until he produced a wad of case folded in an envelope. "Ah!" He threw the envelope at Asuka. "Now yew buy!"  
源堂发出一声沮丧的喊叫，猛击了他的床头柜。他再次看向床头柜，然后灵光一闪。他咕哝着，翻找床头柜的抽屉，直到拿出一个装在信封里的厚厚一叠钞票。“啊！”他把信封扔向明日香。“现在你买！”

Asuka took a moment to count the contents of the envelope before nodding. She stashed it in her book bag, "Why, thank you." She walked out the room and towards the vending machine.  
明日香花了一点时间清点信封里的内容，然后点头。她把它塞进书包，“为什么，谢谢你。”她走出房间，朝自动售货机走去。

"Hey!" Gendo roared out in realization. Asuka went to town and madly began to clear out the machine's inventory one order at a time. "Damn Soryews!"  
"嘿！" 源堂怒吼一声，恍然大悟。明日香火力全开，疯狂地一笔接一笔清空机器的库存。"该死的 Soryews！"

The door suddenly hissed open, Shinji stormed in, whom Asuka stared at, completely stunned by the furious energy the boy gave off.  
门突然嘶嘶作响地打开，真嗣冲了进来，明日香盯着他，完全被男孩散发出的愤怒能量惊呆了。

"How could you father!?" "你怎么能这样，父亲！？"

Asuka peered through the window for a moment, but her conscience got a hold of her and she tip-toed away.  
明日香透过窗户窥视了一会儿，但她的良心抓住了她，于是她蹑手蹑脚地离开了。

Gendo clutched his blanket close to his chest and stared blankly at Shinji.  
源堂紧紧抓住他的毯子，紧贴胸口，茫然地盯着真嗣。

"Fuyutsuki told me everything, Father! How could you abandon Rei to this life? She was only four!" Shinji pointed a finger at his chest, "That's how old I was when Mother-"  
"“副司令告诉我一切了，父亲！你怎么能抛弃丽去过这样的生活？她才四岁！”真嗣指着自己的胸口，“我那时也是四岁，母亲——”

The two of them both looked away from each other. Shinji tried to catch his breath, while Gendo's eyes widened and he nibbled on his thumb. "_So you spilled the beans, damn you, Fuyutsuki."_  
两人都避开了对方的目光。真嗣试图喘口气，而源堂的眼睛睁大了，他咬着拇指。“所以你泄露了秘密，该死的，冬月。”

"Yew… yew know?"  "你知道…你知道吗？"

"And- and I understand why you would be angry at Mother for keeping this from us. I am too, but that's not Rei's fault! And whether you like it or not she is a part of Mother! Is that why you hate her, because the rest of it isn't you? That doesn't mean she didn't need you!"  
"而且-我理解你为什么会对母亲隐瞒这件事感到愤怒。我也是，但这不是绫波的错！不管你喜不喜欢，她都是母亲的一部分！这就是你恨她的原因吗，因为剩下的不是你？这并不意味着她不需要你！"

Gendo sat up and glared at Shinji, and could only mumble a few incoherent words before he looked down and twisted his blanket.  
源堂坐起身，瞪着真嗣，只能含糊地咕哝几句，随后低头扭动着毯子。

"She has nobody. She lived her entire life here and That's…" Shinji pressed his lips tightly together as he fought back tears. "Father, that's the last trace of mom that exists, doesn't that mean anything to you?"  
“她无人依靠。她一生都住在这里，而这……”真嗣紧抿双唇，强忍泪水。“父亲，这是妈妈存在的最后痕迹，这对你来说毫无意义吗？”

He continued to avoid his son's gaze.  
他继续避开儿子的目光。

"You know I thought that this could bring us together as a family, that maybe you'd feel a sense of duty or compassion or love but you're too scared or-or- embarrassed…But you're the one that's embarrassing! You got drunk and fought my friend's dad in front of my entire school! I never wanna show my face again."  
"你知道我曾以为这能让我们一家人团结起来，也许你会感到一种责任感、同情心或爱意，但你太害怕了，或者……或者太尴尬了……但真正令人尴尬的是你！你喝醉了，在我全校面前和我朋友的爸爸打架！我再也不想露面了。"

Gendo glared to the side.  
碇源堂向旁边瞪了一眼。

Shinji shook his head at him, "Naoko and Mr. Fuyutsuki told me so many stories about the things you accomplished when you led Gehirn? What happened to you, Father? You used to help people, you were a leader! Do you just want to forget you ever existed and drink yourself to death? And then that's it? Do you really think that's what Mother would've wanted from you?"  
真嗣对他摇了摇头，“直子小姐和冬月老师告诉了我很多你在领导 GEHRIN 时所取得的成就。父亲，你发生了什么变化？你曾经帮助过别人，是个领导者！你难道只想忘记自己曾经存在过，然后酗酒至死吗？你真的认为这是母亲希望你做的吗？”

"Shut up!" Gendo grabbed a nearby cup of porcelain tea and threw it at Shinji. "Gegh ough!"  
“闭嘴！”源堂抓起旁边的一杯瓷茶，朝真嗣扔去。“呃！”

The cup narrowly flew near Shinji's ear, and the hot tea splashed his shirt as it were thrown, but he didn't move in place, he only flinched at the separating crash as the cup smashed against the wall.  
茶杯险些擦过真嗣的耳朵，滚烫的茶水溅在他的衬衫上，但他站在原地一动不动，只是在那茶杯撞墙破碎的瞬间微微一颤。

Gendo's eyes widened at the ramifications of his action. He looked down at the ground, ashamed, and desperate to find something to mend the silence. Gendo picked up a nearby towel and with trembling hands offered it to Shinji. But when he locked eyes with Shinji, saw  
源堂的眼睛因自己行为的后果而睁大。他羞愧地低下头，急切地想要找些什么来打破这沉默。源堂拿起旁边的毛巾，颤抖着双手递给真嗣。但当他与真嗣对视时，看到了……

that look of betrayal in his eyes, the same look he gave his father long ago, and that it might never leave him.  
他眼中那背叛的神情，与多年前他看向父亲时的如出一辙，仿佛永远无法消散。

"The doctors said the sooner you accept treatments, the sooner you can live independently and get a job. That there's still time before it's irreversible." Shinji blanky looked down at the shattered, spilled mess that was left on the floor. "You know how to call the nurses."  
“医生说，你越早接受治疗，就能越早独立生活并找到工作。在那变得不可逆转之前，还有时间。”真嗣茫然地低头看着地板上支离破碎、散落一地的残局。“你知道怎么叫护士。”

Without another word, he opened the door and walked out.  
他没再说一句话，打开门走了出去。

Gendo sat still in the bed and didn't move or make a sound. His bed was situated in the corner on the left of the window, and there was his refuge as he slumped his exhausted mind against the cold wall. He looked out the window and saw somebody exit the liquor-store. It was definitely the Soryu-spawn, but she disguised herself with a kind of black cap a delinquent would wear, large sunglasses and a long black coat that all must have been hidden somehow before in her school bag.  
源度静静地坐在床上，一动不动，一声不吭。他的床位于窗户左侧的角落，当他疲惫的思绪倚靠在冰冷的墙壁上时，那里成了他的避难所。他望向窗外，看到有人从酒铺出来。那无疑是索留家的孩子，但她伪装得很好，戴着一顶不良少年会戴的黑色帽子，大号太阳镜，还有一件长长的黑色外套，这些之前肯定都藏在她的书包里。

She also carried a blue umbrella to shield herself from the heatwave, which the Soryu-spawn reopened as she crossed the road.  
她还拿着一把蓝色雨伞来遮挡热浪，当她过马路时，索留家的孩子重新打开了伞。

Gendo felt a mix of giddiness and guilt for the success of his heist, the two fought against each other like two tidal waves, crashing against each other. He held his trembling hands into a tent and fought to hold them together.  
源度感到一阵兴奋与内疚交织，为自己的劫掠成功，两者如同两股巨浪，相互撞击。他颤抖的双手紧紧相握，努力保持稳定。

---

Asuka snuck up the hospital floors through the much more laborious but discreet fire-escape, chuckling to herself as she half-jogged up the stairs in victory, not sure who she should deliver the bounty to. It was risky, sure, but she wasn't an ordinary pilot anymore, she was a Captain. And the higher ranks don't have to follow the rules because they make them.  
明日香通过更为费力但隐蔽的消防逃生梯悄悄爬上医院楼层，半跑半跳地胜利攀登着楼梯，心中暗笑，不确定该将战利品交给谁。确实有风险，但她已不再是普通的驾驶员，而是上尉。高阶军官不必遵守规则，因为他们就是制定规则的人。

"Eh?"

She stopped at the next flight of stairs as she realized that Shinji blocked it where he sat at the top, his head tucked away between his knees.  
她在一层楼梯处停下，意识到真嗣挡在了那里，坐在顶端，头埋在双膝之间。

"Oh come on! What happened to the whole 'Man of the House' thing? Huh?" Asuka crossed her arms and waited for a response. But Shinji remained crumpled. "D-don't ask me to do the fucking pep-talk, I'm not gonna do it-"  
“哦，拜托！那个‘一家之主’的豪言壮语呢？嗯？”明日香交叉双臂，等待回应。但真嗣依旧蜷缩着。“别让我来做那该死的鼓励演讲，我不会做的——”

"I don't want a pep-talk. I just wanna be left alone."  
"我不想听什么鼓励的话。我只想一个人待着。"

"Well great, move out of the way then!" Asuka hesitated to step past him, and god forbid, brush by. "You're like a… sponge of sad soy sauce, dude. You know that?"  
"那太好了，那就让开吧！" 明日香犹豫着从他身边走过，天哪，千万别碰到他。"你就像个……悲伤酱油的海绵，老兄。你知道吗？"

"Thanks." Shinji looked up, his eyes were dry but he raised an eyebrow at Asuka's, "Why are you wearing a trench coat?"  
"谢谢。" 真嗣抬头看向明日香，他的眼睛干涩，但眉毛微微一挑，"你为什么穿着风衣？"

"Why are you such a little cry-baby?"  
"你为什么这么爱哭鼻子？"

"I'm-I'm not a-" "我-我不是-"

"Wah-wah-wah!" "哇-哇-哇！"

"Stop that-" "别这样——"

Asuka mockingly mimicked him and jumped around the steps, "My daddy don't wespect me! WAH-wah-wah-"  
明日香嘲讽地模仿他，在台阶上跳来跳去，"我爸爸不尊重我！哇——哇——哇——"

Shinji finally sat up, "Why do you hate me!?"  
真嗣终于坐起身来，"你为什么讨厌我！？"

"I never said I hated you, I said you irritated me. Because you do, that's all." Asuka looked up past the staircase.  
"我从没说过我恨你，我说的是你让我烦。因为你的确如此，仅此而已。" 明日香抬头望向楼梯上方。

"That's not all you say. W-what about Idiot? Or Numbnuts? Retard? Pussy-boy!?"  
"你说的远不止这些。那‘白痴’呢？还是‘傻瓜’？‘弱智’？‘娘娘腔’！？"

Asuka fought back a snigger. "You-you gotta admit that, that one's pretty funny." Shinji remained silent, staring deadpan at her, "Fine, you're not a pussy. But you gotta admit this… this is pussy-behavior. I'm just trying to help toughen you up against the real world, do you really think the Angels are just gonna stand by while you're feeling down and-" Asuka blinked in realization. "I'm giving you a pep talk." Asuka brushed past, "You made me give you a fucking pep-talk! Mother-fucker!" She stopped past the next flight of stairs and pointed a finger at him, "That's where you cross the line!"  
明日香强忍住笑意。"你得承认，那个词确实挺滑稽的。" 真嗣依旧沉默，面无表情地盯着她，"好吧，你不是娘娘腔。但你得承认这一点……这种行为很娘。我只是想帮你面对现实世界变得更坚强些，你真以为使徒会因为你情绪低落就袖手旁观吗——" 明日香突然意识到。"我在给你打气。" 她擦身而过，"你居然让我给你他妈的打气！混蛋！" 她在下一层楼梯处停下，指着他，"那是你的底线！

Shinji stared at the finger for a moment of confusion, "I didn't even do anything!"  
真嗣困惑地盯着那根手指，“我什么都没做啊！”

"Exactly!" Asuka gestured to the coat, "At least I made use of my time today and-"  
“正是！”明日香指着外套，“至少我今天利用了时间，而且——”

"He gave you money to buy liquor, didn't he?" Shinji asked rhetorically.  
“他给你钱买酒了，对吧？”真嗣反问道。

Asuka hesitated for a moment and pulled out the bottle of Sake and the envelope of the remaining cash. "I uh… I also got some Reese's-Pieces too, but I'll pay him back." She picked at the bottles label, She chuckled to herself. "Well, I thought you could dump it all out into a sink in front of your old man to teach him a lesson."  
明日香犹豫了一下，掏出了那瓶清酒和剩下的现金信封。“我……我还买了些 Reese's-Pieces，不过我会还给他的。”她拨弄着瓶子上的标签，自嘲地笑了笑。“嗯，我想你可以把这些全倒进水槽里，给你的老爹一个教训。”

Shinji looked down, "I don't care anymore, Langley. He can have it for all I care. The money from his insurance too." He looked up at Asuka and offered a shrug, "It's not my problem anymore."  
真嗣低头说道：“我不在乎了，兰格雷。他想要就拿去吧，连同他的保险金一起。”他抬头看向明日香，耸了耸肩，“这已经不是我的问题了。”

She looked down for a moment and hesitated, after a beat she went down to Shinji's flight of stairs and sat next to him, two steps above. She offered him the bottle, "Cheers to that?"  
她低头犹豫了一会儿，然后走到真嗣的楼梯前，坐在他旁边，比他高两级台阶。她把酒瓶递给他，“为这个干杯？”

"Me? I dunno. Aren't you worried about being in trouble?"  
"我？我不知道。你不怕惹上麻烦吗？"

"Pfft. I do it all the time, like everyone else in this dump. How do you think I put up with it all?"  
"噗。我经常这么做，像这里其他人一样。你以为我是怎么忍受这一切的？"

Shinji tilted his head. "Really? I dunno. I'd still feel like a hypocrite."  
真嗣歪了歪头。 "真的吗？我不知道。我还是会觉得自己像个伪君子。"

Asuka shrugged and lifted the bottle, "To hypocrisy." She looked at the bottle and saw Shinji in the corner of her eyes watching curiously. "Down the hatch-" Asuka took a large swig and instantly spat it out, nearly knocking the bottle over with an anguished groan in between coughs, "Kagh-kagh- oh god- kagh-kagh." "  
明日香耸了耸肩，举起瓶子，“敬虚伪。”她瞥见瓶子，发现真嗣在眼角余光中好奇地看着。“一饮而尽——”明日香猛灌一口，随即喷了出来，痛苦地咳嗽着，差点把瓶子打翻，“咳咳——哦天哪——咳咳。”

Shinji noticed the bottle tilted over and caught it before it could fall. "Are you okay?" He looked down at the bottle, "Maybe I should get rid of this…"  
真嗣注意到瓶子倾斜，赶在它掉落前接住了。“你还好吗？”他低头看着瓶子，“也许我该把它处理掉……”

Asuka in her writhing agony, waved her hands in objection, "No, no, leave it, I'm gonna save it for later. It's just a really shitty flavor."  
明日香在痛苦的挣扎中挥手反对，“不，不，留着吧，我打算以后再用。只是味道真的很糟糕。”

"Right…" Shinji reached into his pocket and pulled out a pack of gum.  
"好吧……" 真嗣伸手从口袋里掏出一包口香糖。

She regarded it warily before accepting. The horrific stench of permanent marker faded after a moment, but Asuka strained to speak. "...Thanks."  
她警惕地看了看，然后接了过来。永久性记号笔的可怕气味片刻后消散了，但明日香费力地开口道："...谢谢。"

Shinji was taken aback, but finally a small smile grew back on him. "You're welcome."  
真嗣有些惊讶，但最终还是露出了微笑。 "不客气。"

The two sat there for a while, the two fidgeted nervously in silence until Asuka finally cleared her throat. "So."  
两人就这样坐了一会儿，各自紧张地沉默着，直到明日香终于清了清喉咙。“那么。”

"Y-yeah?' “嗯-嗯？”

"After this conference gets broadcasted worldwide tomorrow, Unit-02 is gonna be the mascot for NERV. So I'm gonna be super famous after that." Asuka replied. "Naoko said they might have me traveling overseas to resolve conflicts, or to make sure peace treaties get signed and all that lame stuff. She said Unit-02 might even be on some kid's lunch boxes. You believe that? I just won't have time to… y'know, hang around the small town anymore." She looked away.  
“等明天这个会议全球直播后，二号机就要成为 NERV 的吉祥物了。到时候我会变得超级有名。直子说他们可能会让我出国去解决冲突，或者确保和平条约的签署之类的无聊事。她说二号机甚至可能出现在某个孩子的午餐盒上。你信吗？我就不会有时间……你知道的，再在小城镇里闲逛了。”她转过头去。

The words sunk into Shinji, his eyes turned a darker shade of blue, "...Oh."  
话语渗入真嗣心中，他的眼眸变得更加深邃，"...哦。"

Asuka looked at the clear bottle of Sake, her face distorted in the reflection. "...So… Is there anything you wanna say to me before I go?'  
明日香看着那瓶清澈的清酒，镜中的面容扭曲了。 "...那么…在我走之前，你有什么想对我说的吗？"

"Will it make you happy?" Shinji responded.  
"那会让你开心吗？" 真嗣回应道。

"Huh?" “啊？”

"Is that what you want to do? Because if it's what makes you happy then-"  
"那是你想做的吗？因为如果是让你快乐的事，那么——"

"Well it feels good to finally get credit where credit's due."  
"嗯，终于得到应有的认可，感觉真好。"

Shinji looked down sheepishly, "Then I'm happy for you."  
真嗣羞涩地低下头，"那么，我为你感到高兴。"

Asuka stared in disbelief for a moment, and she could only let out a nervous sputter, "What's that got to do with anything? It's my job. And why do you even care?"  
明日香愣了一会儿，难以置信地盯着，只能紧张地结巴道：“这跟什么有关系？这是我的工作。你又为什么在乎？”

"Of course I care about your well being, but like you said you wanted me to-" Shinji held his fingers up in air quotes, "-'Stay out of your hair'. Well that's all I've been doing."  
“我当然关心你的安危，但就像你说的，你希望我——”真嗣用手指在空中比划着引号，“——‘别管你’。我一直都是这么做的。”

"Well, this way you won't have to worry about having your feet on both sides of the fence now." Asuka huffed, crossed her arms and turned away from him.  
"“这样你就不会再担心脚踏两条船了。”明日香哼了一声，交叉双臂，转身背对他。”

"...What!? What does that even mean?"  
"...什么！？那是什么意思？"

She glanced back at him, "You know what it means."  
她回头看了他一眼，"你知道那是什么意思。"

"No? What-" Shinji seemed crosswired, "You're crazy!"  
"不知道？什么-" 真嗣显得有些混乱，"你疯了！"

"Yeah? You're one to talk, being so pushy about Naoko allowing Rei to come with us. You've had your own thing going on since day one, so:" Asuka sat up, and stuffed her hands in her pockets and began to walk up the stairs. "I'm just gonna let you see for yourself where that road with her takes you-"  
"是吗？你倒是说说看，这么急着让直子允许丽跟我们一起来。你从一开始就有自己的打算，所以：" 明日香坐起身，把手插进口袋，开始走上楼梯。"我只想让你亲自看看，这条路和她会带你去哪里——"

"It's not like that!" Shinji protested.  
"不是那样的！" 真嗣辩解道。"

"Oh yeah?" Asuka put her hands on her hips, "Then why did you introduce her first to your dad instead of me?"  
"哦，是吗？" 明日香双手叉腰，"那你为什么先介绍她给你爸而不是我？"

"But I did introduce you first!" Shinji remained sitting this whole time.  
"但我确实先介绍了你！" 真嗣一直坐着没动。

"Nuh-uh!" "不对！"

"Yes I did!" Shinji called back, "I remember because introduced you as 'captain.'"  
"我确实介绍了！" 真嗣回喊道，"我记得是因为我介绍你为'队长'。"

"Well-" Asuka frowned in thought for a moment, her face grew red and she waved a hand in dismissal. "I don't really remember, it's a hot day." She pointed a finger accusingly at him, "But it's still weird! Don't deny it!"  
"嗯——" 明日香皱眉沉思片刻，脸颊泛红，挥手表示不在意。"我真的不记得了，天气太热了。" 她用手指责备地指向他，"但这还是很奇怪！别否认！"

Shinji shrugged as he minced his words carefully, "W-well it's hard for me to explain-"  
真嗣耸耸肩，小心翼翼地斟酌词句，"我、我很难解释——"

Asuka crossed her arms, "What did Old Man Fuyustuki even say to you?"  
明日香交叉双臂，"老狐狸冬月到底跟你说了什么？"

"I promised I wouldn't say." Shinji looked around nervously. "He told me Naoko can't know."  
"我答应过我不会说的。" 真嗣紧张地环顾四周。"他告诉我直子不能知道。"

"Trust me, whatever it is, she already does know."  
"相信我，不管是什么，她已经知道了。"

A thought lit up in Shinji's eyes, "Maybe I can show you, and it will make more sense." He waved her over and pulled something out of his pocket. "Come see this."  
一个念头在真嗣眼中闪过，"也许我可以展示给你看，这样会更明白。" 他招手让她过来，从口袋里掏出一样东西。"过来看看这个。"

Asuka eyed him with a squint, "Why?"  
明日香眯眼盯着他，"为什么？"

"Can I show you?" "我可以给你看吗？"

After a moment, Asuka annoyingly huffed and sat down next to him. He pulled out Rei's ID card, "You keep a picture in your wallet? You sicko-"  
过了一会儿，明日香不悦地哼了一声，坐到他旁边。他掏出绫波的身份证，"你钱包里还放照片？你这变态——"

"Will you wait!?" Shinji snapped at her.  
“你能等一下吗？！”真嗣对她厉声说道。

"Fine….Jeez." Asuka watched as Shinji pulled out another photo of… "So what, she wore a brown wig?'  
“好吧……真是的。”明日香看着真嗣又拿出一张照片，“所以呢，她戴了棕色假发？”

Shinji shook his head and pointed at the other picture, "Asuka… That's my mother. Don't you see the resemblance?"  
真嗣摇了摇头，指着另一张照片说：“明日香……这是我母亲。你不觉得她们很像吗？”

He offered her the picture to look closer at and Asuka only leaned in closer as she scanned every detail. It did look like her. Too much like her. "That's where they…"  
他递给她那张照片，让她仔细看看，明日香凑得更近，审视着每一个细节。确实很像她，太像她了。“那就是他们……”

"What was that?" Shinji asked.  
“那是什么？”真嗣问道。

Asuka snapped to attention, "Eh? Do I see a resemblance? Like she might be Rei's mom, so she must be your sister?"  
明日香突然回过神来，“诶？我看出相似之处了吗？就像她可能是绫波的妈妈，所以她一定是你姐姐？”

"Well… yes." "嗯…是的。"

"And that's what Fuyutsuki said?"  
"这就是冬月说的？"

Shinji nodded at her, "It's the truth." He waited for her to crack into another one of those fits of laughter, but instead she seemed miles away. "Langley?"  
真嗣向她点头，"这是真的。"他等着她再次爆发出那种大笑，但她似乎心不在焉。"兰利？"

"Fuyutsuki lied to you, dumbass." Asuka said coldly, "You can't trust anything that guy says, he felt sorry for you. Just told you what you wanted to hear."  
"冬月骗了你，傻瓜。" 明日香冷冷地说，"那家伙的话一句都不能信，他只是同情你。只是说了你想听的话。"

"No he didn't!" Shinji stood his ground, "You mistook my mom for Rei too, you said it yourself."  
"不，他没有！" 真嗣坚定地站在原地，"你也把我的妈妈错认成丽了，你自己说的。"

Asuka was silent for a moment, she looked at both pictures, then at Shinji. "You people all look the same to me."  
明日香沉默了一会儿，她看了看两张照片，又看了看真嗣。"你们这些人对我来说都长得差不多。"

"W-what did you say?" "你-你说什么？"

"Rei isn't anything to you, she's your co-pilot that you're emotionally projecting your issues onto. It's all just a coincidence."  
"丽对你来说什么都不是，她只是你的副驾驶，你把情感问题投射到她身上。这一切都只是巧合。"

"How could you say that? I've never-"  
"你怎么能这么说？我从未-"

Asuka didn't relent, "-And it's going to make you do something stupid that will get you, her, or other people in this city killed. So drop it."  
明日香毫不退让，“而且这会让你做出愚蠢的事情，可能会让你、她，或者这个城市的其他人丧命。所以放弃吧。”

"I have my limits,and I'm tired of everyone treating me like I'm crazy when all I'm trying to do is the right thing! Just because I don't have some DNA test to prove it doesn't mean I know it's true."  
“我有我的底线，我厌倦了每个人都把我当疯子，我只是在努力做正确的事！仅仅因为我没有 DNA 测试来证明这一点，并不意味着我知道它是真的。”

"You're emotionally compromised."  
“你情绪失控了。”

Shinji shook his head, "No, for the first time in my life I feel like I'm meant to be here. Not just being useful, but that I can make a difference here. Feeling like I have somebody to protect, that I'm not alone, that's what makes me want to fight the Angels."  
真嗣摇了摇头，“不，这是我第一次觉得我属于这里。不仅仅是变得有用，而是我能在这里有所作为。感觉到我有需要保护的人，我不孤单，这才是我想与使徒战斗的原因。”

Asuka sat down a few steps down below Shinji and ignored him. "We're both alone, idiot. But I guess you'll see. Eventually."  
明日香坐在真嗣下面几级台阶上，无视了他。“我们都是孤独的，傻瓜。但我想你会明白的。最终。”

"You're not alone. Remember what Naoko always said? We're a team."  
“你不孤单。记得直子总是怎么说吗？我们是一个团队。”

"Yeah I am." Asuka scowled, "Now stop reminding me."  
"是啊，我是。" 明日香皱眉，"现在别再提醒我了。"

"When we first had that breakfast together, with Naoko, and the three of us, I really thought we could've all been friends…" Shinji watched Asuka begin to crumple as he hesitantly sat a few steps above. "I care about you, does that also make me emotionally compromised?"  
"当我们第一次一起吃早餐，和直子，我们三个人，我真的以为我们都能成为朋友……" 真嗣看着明日香开始崩溃，他犹豫地坐在几级台阶之上。"我在乎你，这也会让我情感上受牵制吗？"

"Dude just shut up!" Asuka stood up hastily and knocked Shinji over, "Spare me your family soap opera, I have shit to do! I'm gonna be on national TV soon, I don't need this."  
"伙计，闭嘴吧！" 明日香迅速站起来，把真嗣撞倒，"别跟我扯家庭肥皂剧，我有事要做！我很快就要上全国电视了，我不需要这个。"

Shinji stepped up the stairs, "Well you have fun with that!" He fled the scene and jogged away.  
真嗣踏上楼梯，“那你就好好享受吧！”他逃离现场，小跑着离开。

"I will! And I'm gonna have an absolute fucking blast!" Asuka looked up past the railing.  
“我会的！绝对会玩得爽翻天！”明日香抬头望向栏杆上方。

He only responded with a dismissive wave as he kept jogging up the stairs.  
他只是不以为意地挥了挥手，继续小跑上楼。

Asuka sat alone in silence, she snorted, "I don't need him, I don't need anything." She picked up the bottle of Sake and patted it, "Got everything I need right here."  
明日香独自静坐，冷哼一声，“我不需要他，我什么都不需要。”她拿起那瓶清酒，轻拍着它，“我需要的都在这儿了。”

Shinji's footsteps faded away, Asuka kicked her feet back and sniffed at the bottle, some of it leaked out and got over her hands. What time was it anyway? She reached for her phone and checked.  
真嗣的脚步声渐行渐远，明日香踢了踢脚，嗅了嗅瓶口，一些酒液漏出，沾湿了她的手。现在几点了？她伸手去拿手机查看。

**Eleven Thirty-five AM. 上午十一点三十五分。**

_Naoko is picking me up in twenty-five minutes?  
直子二十五分钟后会来接我？_

Very quickly the chewing gum Shinji gave her had no effect, and Asuka could smell the alcohol even more so now from that one foolish sip. Sweat dripped into her eyes as her heat bent went faster and faster.  
很快，真嗣给她的口香糖就失去了效果，那一次愚蠢的尝试让明日香现在更能闻到酒精的味道。汗水滴入她的眼睛，她的身体热得越来越快。

Asuka discreetly moved to the nearest washroom to quickly dump the sake into a toilet and dispose of the evidence.  
明日香悄悄地移动到最近的洗手间，迅速将清酒倒入马桶并销毁证据。

_You stupid kid._ She thought to herself. _You stupid fucking kid, what were you thinking? You're going to ruin this entire conference._  
你这个蠢孩子。她暗自想着。你这个该死的蠢孩子，到底在想什么？你这是要把整个会议都搞砸了。

_With one little sip?  就因为一小口？_

_She probably has you caught on camera too, you know.  
她很可能连你也拍进镜头里了，你知道吧。_

"I know, I know." Asuka growled to herself. She leaned over the counter and stared at the mirror, challenging herself. "You're not a kid, You're a captain now, someone with rank and respect."  
“我知道，我知道。”明日香自言自语地咕哝着。她俯身靠在柜台上，盯着镜子，挑战自己。“你不再是孩子了，你现在是一名队长，拥有军衔和尊敬。”

Asuka cleared her throat. She sharpened up her post and attempted a smile. "Hi there, I'm Asuka, Asuka Langley S-"  
明日香清了清嗓子。她挺直了身姿，试着露出一个微笑。“你好，我是明日香，明日香·兰格雷·S——”

She stopped and stared at the mirror for a moment, then tried again. She forced another smile.  
她停了下来，盯着镜子片刻，然后再次尝试。她强挤出一个微笑。

"Hey. Hey, Langley Asuka. Captain Langley Asuka.-"  
"嘿。嘿，兰利·惣流。兰利·惣流舰长。"

---

"Soryu, pleased to meet you." Kyoko stared at the mirror in her dimly lit, air conditioned office. She nodded to herself and forced a small smile, "Likewise.I look forward to our collaboration-" She blinked at her reflection.  
"惣流，很高兴见到你。" 响子盯着她那昏暗空调办公室里的镜子。她对自己点点头，勉强挤出一个微笑，"同样高兴。期待我们的合作——" 她对着镜子眨了眨眼。

Wrong. Too forced. She glanced down at her neck. The old faded red rope marks\ were showing. Kyoko pulled up her turtleneck sweater and stared at herself. She upturned the collar of her black, golden trimmed coat for good measure.  
不对。太勉强了。她瞥了一眼自己的脖子。那些旧的淡红色绳痕露了出来。响子拉起她的高领毛衣，盯着镜子里的自己。她又翻起黑色金边外套的领子，以确保遮掩得当。

"Hello there. Chief Scientist Kyoko Zeppelin Soryu, pleased to meet you."  
"你好，我是首席科学家绫波齐柏林苍龙，很高兴见到你。"
