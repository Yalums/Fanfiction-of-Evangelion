### Chapter 1 daffodils

Her stare took form in his mind: a glint. A lighter. Sunlight. Auburn hair rode desperately along her body, from the pearl of her skin down to the sullied, sanguine salvia-glazed shoulders of her suit, a mark of the beast. Emerald eyes, a juxtaposition to the boring mauve of her intestines. He was a witness of those colours; he was a testament to her pain. Unbidden.  
她的凝视在他心中成形：一抹闪光。一束火光。阳光。红褐色的发丝绝望地沿着她的身躯流淌，从她肌肤的珍珠般光泽，一直延伸到她沾满血污、被血红唾液浸透的西装肩部，那是野兽的印记。翡翠般的双眼，与她乏味的紫罗兰色内脏形成鲜明对比。他是那些色彩的见证者；他是她痛苦的证明。不由自主。

And he thought in those moments. Her gore. This gore shore in which they both resided; he lacked the will to turn to meet her gaze. Her palpable scowl, owning such will and fire to set him alight. And why would he? The sand held less agony. The gravity of the earth now felt so much more brittle. So much more beautiful.  
在那些时刻，他想到了。她的鲜血。这片他们共同居住的血腥海岸；他没有勇气转身去迎接她的目光。她那明显的皱眉，拥有如此的意志和火焰，足以将他点燃。他为何要这么做？沙子承载的痛苦更少。地球的重力现在感觉如此脆弱。如此美丽。

His maeve spoke. His drug moved further out of reach.  
他的玛芙开口了。他的药物离得更远了。

"Did you like being a monster?"  
“你喜欢成为怪物吗？”

Flash, and he returned to sin. Crosses, owning no boundary in colour, shape, size or definition. Product of Rei. Product of him.  
一闪，他又回到了罪恶之中。十字架，不受颜色、形状、大小或定义的界限限制。雷的产品。他的产物。

When his answer materialised, the seldom tinge of need cracked his voice once more.  
当他的回答浮现时，那罕见的渴望之情再次让他的声音出现了裂痕。

"I loved it." “我很喜欢。”

---

Reality leaked back into him, just a little bit. What once seemed a web of chaos now unwound back into a single lengthy thread of events; each remnant of his surroundings pertained a truth that, for some reason, he now could bear. Had he grown?  
现实一点点渗回他的意识中。曾经看似一片混乱的网状事件，如今又重新编织成一条长长的线索；他周围每一处残留的痕迹，都蕴含着一个真相，出于某种原因，他现在能够承受。是他成长了吗？

Assuming from the glare of red around his scapegoat's neck, he hadn't.  
从他替罪羊脖子上那圈刺目的红色来看，他显然没有。

There were so many colours here, he noticed, stone eyes shifting lento from the moon-marked streaks of sand around him to the mass of red sea before him. Grass, red. Cliffs, red. Cities, red.  
这里有太多颜色了，他注意到，石质的眼眸缓缓从他周围月光斑驳的沙痕移向面前那片红色的海洋。草地，红色。悬崖，红色。城市，红色。

Nevermind, there weren't many colours here at all, he realised. It was all red.  
别介意，他意识到，这里根本没有什么颜色。一切都是红色的。

The stars held no purpose now, even with their brilliance dying all around him. All he could see, all he managed, was one red loop. Another one of his results, planetary in scale.  
星辰如今已无意义，尽管它们的光辉在他四周逐渐黯淡。他所能见到的，他所能做到的，仅是一道红色环带。这是他的另一个成果，规模宏大如行星。

She hadn't moved since their last interaction. Not one they cherished, but it was a marvel they had managed words at all. He didn't like words very much now, he surmised: all they seemed to do is cause him pain. That's all this beach was now. even when faced with a forget-me-not blue, this beach caused him the same puncture.  
自上次互动后，她未曾挪动半步。那并非一段值得珍视的时光，但令人惊叹的是他们竟还能交谈。他推测自己现在并不喜欢言语：似乎它们只会给他带来痛苦。这片海滩如今便是如此，即便面对着勿忘我般的湛蓝，这片海滩仍给他带来同样的刺痛。

Pain.

He couldn't bear feeling comfortable with it any longer.  
他再也无法忍受与此共处的舒适感。

Unsound, his body creaked itself past the exhaustion that the shoreline infected him with. Crying felt wasteful. Though, it wouldn't halt him much, deciding to liberate his joints from any ache or stress upon it before. A stand was one movement. Swift, something he might not have been ready for. But he had to move, for if he didn't, he feared descent. And that, for him, was a hell beyond comprehension.  
他的身体在疲惫中吱吱作响，勉强撑过了海岸线带来的倦怠。哭泣似乎是种浪费。尽管如此，他决定在行动前先让关节摆脱任何疼痛或压力。站立是一个动作。迅速，这可能是他尚未准备好的。但他必须移动，因为如果不这样做，他害怕坠落。而对他来说，那是一种无法理解的深渊。

He shouldn't leave her here. He thought closely about that, the dried soak of his clothes now bearing recognition on his body.  
他不应该把她留在这里。他仔细思考着这一点，湿透的衣服如今在他身上留下了痕迹。

He used to feel safe in these clothes.  
他曾经觉得穿着这些衣服很安全。

Their pairing shared the dried crust of the ocean now, or at least, what was left of it. Oh, the plugsuit. It seemed she wasn't plagued by that issue. They needed to escape here, right? His eyes might not have held such aspirations to her, probably endowed with the same disturbed look as before. Although, her eye hadn't managed any better, the frost of her iris caving in on his ego.  
他们共享着这片海洋的干涸边缘，或者说，至少是它残留的部分。哦，那件紧身衣。看来她并未受此困扰。他们需要逃离这里，对吧？他的眼神或许并未向她透露这样的渴望，大概依旧带着之前那种困扰的神情。尽管如此，她的眼神也并未表现得更好，她冰冷的瞳孔似乎在压迫着他的自尊。

She was staring at him. And he wasn't imagining it this time.  
她在盯着他看。这次他并没有产生错觉。

In the time he had risen, she had perched herself on the sand. And now, she was rising too, his tracking eyes mirroring her own mistful ones. Indifference filled them. Indifference aimed solely towards him. For some reason, it made his heart slack a beat. Open, and her visage served more dread than any hell ever could. No, hell seemed like a holiday. Blink, though, and reverie freed him from the vile fury he anticipated. Almost playfully, however, she didn't release any devil from her depths.  
在他起身的时间里，她已经坐在了沙地上。而现在，她也在起身，他的目光与她朦胧的眼神相映成趣。冷漠充斥其间。这种冷漠完全是对着他来的。不知为何，这让他的心跳漏了一拍。她的面容，坦然而现，带来的恐惧远胜任何地狱。不，地狱倒像是个假期。然而，眨眼间，幻想将他从预期的恶毒愤怒中解脱出来。几乎带着戏谑，她并未从深渊中释放出任何恶魔。

That felt worse though. A lot worse. A more unique sort of torture, the ostracisation of his being.  
但这种感觉更糟，糟糕得多。这是一种更独特的折磨，他的存在被排斥。

Instead of a roar, she took a step, her eye clamped shut against the boy's instinctive judgement. Puzzled, he matched her pace. One step forward, One step backwards. A cotillion. Although, eventually, her pace trumped his own, a purposeful stride towards the cherry grass of the shore's coast overtaking and overpowering his understanding.  
她没有咆哮，而是向前迈了一步，眼睛紧闭，对抗着男孩本能的判断。他困惑地与她同步，一步向前，一步后退，像是一场小步舞。然而，最终她的步伐胜过了他，朝着海岸边樱桃草的方向，坚定地迈步，超越并压倒了他的理解。

A contrast to his thoughts of desertion, she seemed not to hold much consideration over him.  
与他对抛弃的思考形成对比，她似乎并不怎么考虑他。

Almost typical. 几乎寻常。

Almost made him want to apologise, almost made him want to say anything at all, just to affirm some sort of connection between them.  
几乎让他想要道歉，几乎让他想说些什么，只为确认他们之间某种联系的存在。

Too many almosts. 太多的几乎。

As he followed, more out of a curious nature than one of the same purpose she seemed to own, there was no revolt. No words spat, no tinge of flame. Still, no comfort was found within the myriad of silence they found themselves belonging in.  
他跟随其后，更多的是出于好奇而非她所展现的那种目的性，心中并无反抗。没有恶语相向，没有一丝怒火。然而，在这片他们仿佛归属的无数沉默中，依然找不到任何慰藉。

Perturbation. 不安。

Stone body, fleeting eyes. A twig. A pavement. A fallen castle.  
石雕般的身躯，转瞬即逝的目光。一根树枝。一条人行道。一座倾颓的城堡。

Behold the puzzle that never stopped solving;  
看那永不停歇的谜题；

Everything was red. 一切都是红色的。

Be it the abused mesh of hair fronting him, obeying the wind's current with a calming violence that his hair couldn't dare to dance to, or the crimson kingdom in which they both used to call home. Or at least, maybe she could call it home. Home is where the heart is, and Tokyo-3 never managed to steal that from him.  
无论是他面前那被风吹得凌乱的发丝，还是他们曾称之为家的这片血色王国。至少，她或许能称之为家。心之所在即为家，而第三新东京市从未能从他那里夺走那份归属感。

A little longer and the blush of city street remnants was the only evil left to weigh him. That's all this was really, an evil memory of a city. The sky held no scrapes, no towers to mark humanity's abominable evolution. Now, these streets were primitive. Natural, if you could say that, with the enemy of greenery dominating over the planet's surface. Stained, ruined, a gross render of what should be.  
再过不久，城市街道的余晖将成为唯一压在他心头的恶。这其实不过是一场城市的邪恶记忆。天空没有划痕，没有塔楼标记人类可憎的进化。如今，这些街道显得原始。自然，如果你愿意这么说，绿意盎然的敌人主宰着地球表面。污迹斑斑，破败不堪，是对应有的景象的粗劣再现。

There was so much negativity here. So much hatred. So many words that he feared to speak.  
这里充斥着如此多的负面情绪。如此多的仇恨。有太多话语他害怕说出口。

Mostly because of her. 主要是因为她。

Her shape was uncomfortable, with the tranquil control of her path lacking the characteristic ire he had come to accept. Not lacklustre though, not at all. It was almost relieving, the lack of words to fall from her mouth. Not comfortable, it wouldn't be for a while if she were to stay this silent. Still, relieving.  
她的姿态显得有些不自在，她平静的步伐控制中缺少了他已习惯的那种怒气。但绝非无精打采，一点儿也不。这种无言的沉默几乎让人感到宽慰，尽管并不舒适，如果她继续这样沉默下去，这种状态恐怕还会持续一段时间。然而，这确实是一种解脱。

But the thought of the hereafter feasted on anxiety. Prudence wouldn't serve him well.  
但关于来世的念头却加剧了他的焦虑。谨慎对他并无助益。

Another relief, the crumpled echo of routine helped him reminisce, was that he had realised where the duet was headed. Not a place that he had predicted; they could have headed to the remains of the geofront, if she wanted to spit on nerv's grave, ridding herself of any semblance of an attachment to the scum. Maybe a decaying store, owning enough resources to survive them, or at least her, a few weeks.  
另一种解脱是，日常琐事的破碎回声帮助他回忆起，他已经意识到这场二重奏将走向何方。并非他预料中的地方；他们本可以去往地表的废墟，如果她想在 NERV 的坟墓上吐口水，摆脱对那些渣滓的任何一丝依恋。或许是一家资源充足、足以支撑他们，至少是她，度过几周的衰败商店。

Or, maybe, if she hated him that much, the house was an option.  
或者，如果她对他恨之入骨，房子也是一个选择。

A house of connection. Words to words, heart to heart.  
一座连接之屋。字与字相连，心与心相通。

Hands to throat. 手扼咽喉。

He guessed she must have hated him then.  
他猜想她那时一定恨透了他。

There was a certain kind of dread in this. A peculiar trauma, one that seemed to enlarge the closer he would get. First, a splinter. Then, a stake.  
这其中有一种特定的恐惧。一种奇特的创伤，似乎随着他越接近而越发扩大。起初，是一根刺。接着，变成了一根桩。

Then, a cancer. Error of division.  
然后，成了癌症。分裂的错误。

Each step eked him, for some reason, the times he planted his shoe down onto the ground to walk becoming more arduous not to tear himself away from. His visionaries followed the pitter-patter of sunlight, a habit of escape.  
每一步都让他感到艰难，不知为何，每次他踏出脚步行走时，都变得更加费力，仿佛不愿离开原地。他的目光追随着阳光的斑驳，这是一种逃避的习惯。

But the gravity wasn't brittle now. It held no beauty. it just was.  
但此刻的重力并不脆弱。它没有美感，只是存在。

Stairs, upwards. Hellish heaven. Heaven, angels, wrath. So, were they demons? Devils, onis, ungodly beings designed to strip god of his home. Because this was their home. Their heart, their knowledge, an eschewal of life. Bridge, hands, intertwined for them to cross.  
楼梯，向上。地狱般的乐园。天堂，天使，愤怒。那么，他们是恶魔吗？魔鬼，鬼怪，设计来剥夺上帝家园的邪恶存在。因为这里是他们的家园。他们的心，他们的知识，对生命的逃避。桥，手，交织在一起，让他们得以跨越。

He glanced west: red. 他向西瞥了一眼：红霞满天。

Everything, red. 一切，皆红。

She probably noticed. Colour recoiled from his face, an awestruck maw releasing shallow breaths against the stillness of the walkway. His heart swelled, and as such, his body paused. She did too, though not for what he had. And it wasn't long for her either, at most half a second. Just an obstacle.  
她大概注意到了。色彩从他脸上退去，一张惊叹的嘴在步道的静谧中浅浅呼吸。他的心膨胀起来，随之身体也停顿了。她也停下了，但并非因为他所拥有的。对她来说也不久，最多半秒钟。只是个障碍。

It almost embarrassed him, his own vulnerability. He loved his past, didn't he? Toji, Kensuke- he wished for their happiness above all else. Or rather, he wished for theirs, as they supplemented his own.  
他的脆弱几乎让他感到尴尬。他爱他的过去，不是吗？真嗣、剑介——他最希望他们幸福。或者更确切地说，他希望他们幸福，因为他们的幸福也填补了他自己的。

Was that selfish? 这是自私吗？

No, it was human. That's what it was.  
不，这是人之常情。就是这样。

Memories of a penguin- silly fears of one too. The ichor of alcohol spreading through a bruised body. He missed her.  
企鹅的记忆——愚蠢的恐惧之一。酒精的毒液在受伤的身体中蔓延。他想念她。

Misato. 美里。

A promise. Another connection. Something more physical than maternity.  
一个承诺。另一种联系。比母性更具体的东西。

Something he hated. 他讨厌的东西。

Though, for her, he would do anything. For the faux family they had built, he would do anything. After all, he missed it. Giggles, drunken cuddles as he fixed something other than a plastic supper. Anything was owed, of course.  
尽管如此，为了她，他愿意做任何事。为了他们所构建的这个虚假家庭，他愿意做任何事。毕竟，他怀念这一切。欢笑声，醉意朦胧中的拥抱，当他修理着不仅仅是塑料晚餐的物件时。当然，他觉得这一切都是应得的。

These wild oats he had to sow. For a baggage far heavier than the earth itself, he would do anything. They kept him alive. Kept him breathing, kept him witnessing. It helped him walk.  
这些他必须播撒的野麦。为了一个比地球本身还要沉重的负担，他愿意做任何事。它们让他活下去。让他呼吸，让他见证。这帮助他行走。

So, he walked. 于是，他继续前行。

One more embrace. Before red overtook these beaches, he asked the sketch of his mind a question.  
再拥抱一次。在红色吞噬这片海滩之前，他在脑海的画卷中提出一个问题。

"Do I belong here?" “我属于这里吗？”

Only silence answered him. Though, for his present, he understood the answer. Tokyo-3 did steal his heart after all.  
只有沉默回应了他。尽管如此，他现在明白了答案。东京-3 终究偷走了他的心。

Following sunlight, he paused at the apartment's entrance. There was something that needed to be said. Even his partner had a face of expectation, maybe knowing of the epiphany that had brought him to this door. Though, maybe not. He could have confused expectation with disdain. He didn't care much though, as no more was the idea that this was an intrusion. This was somewhere he needed to be.  
他顺着阳光，在公寓入口处停下。有些话必须说出口。就连他的搭档也面露期待，或许知道那突如其来的顿悟将他带到了这扇门前。不过，也可能不是。他可能把期待误认为是不屑。但他并不太在意，因为不再认为这是打扰。他需要在这里。

Warmth was fragile. 温暖是脆弱的。

Verbatim to Rei, need cracked his voice once more.  
他一字不差地对丽说，需要让他的声音再次破裂。

"I'm home, Asuka." "我回来了，明日香。"

Daffodils turned. 水仙花转了个身。

"Welcome home, monster." "欢迎回家，怪物。"

_AN: this will be something short for me to work on. recently, I managed to stick myself into the rabbit hole of Evangelion. I'm very thankful I did. the emotions this series has brought me, every single form of media to do with it, is breathtaking. I feel like this is owed. a response.  
作者注：这将是我着手创作的一篇短文。最近，我深陷于《新世纪福音战士》的世界中，对此我深感庆幸。这部系列带给我的情感体验，无论是何种媒介形式，都令人叹为观止。我觉得有必要对此作出回应。_

_there's a lot of things that are going to be hard to write. but I think it's needed. something for me, but also something for you; I'm hoping that what I'm planning for this fic can resonate with you as much as me.  
有许多内容将难以书写，但我认为这是必要的。既是为了我自己，也是为了你们；我期望这篇同人作品的构思能与你们产生共鸣，就像我一样。_

_as I am mostly accustomed to writing formats like poems and songs, my writing style may come across as disjointed and messy. which, by all means, it's meant to be. It's a very raw fic, and I'm hoping I can actively include the elements I've taken from my songwriting to help convey my interpretation of the relationship between Asuka and Shinji.  
由于我主要习惯于诗歌和歌曲的写作形式，我的文风可能会显得支离破碎且杂乱无章。这确实是我的本意。这是一篇非常原始的同人作品，我希望能够积极融入我从歌曲创作中汲取的元素，以更好地传达我对明日香与真嗣之间关系的理解。_

_btw, if you listen to oats we sow by Gregory and the hawk, most of the story is given away completely lmao, though I do recommend the song to listen to while reading this chapter.  
顺便说一句，如果你听 Gregory and the Hawk 的《oats we sow》，大部分情节都会被剧透得一干二净，哈哈，不过我还是推荐在阅读这一章时听这首歌。_

_alright, I won't waste your time any longer. thank you for reading, and I'm looking forward to continuing this story!  
好了，不再浪费你的时间了。感谢阅读，期待继续这个故事！_

### Chapter 2 hydrangeas

_And the road, she'd roll  
而那条路，她会翻滚前行  
__round the side of the mountain  
绕山而行  
__With nowhere to go  
无处可去  
__But the heart, we know  
但心脏，我们心知肚明  
__When it's a-loving it's a-leaning toward  
当它充满爱意时，便会倾向于靠近  
__being alone 独处_

A triplet of messy notes.
一组杂乱的音符。

Sunlight was fierce. The oppression of her glare, tyrannical pupils which instilled his mental parliament with singeing anxiety. Paper lips, smothered with heart, a vintage reminder of a former present. Paragon flesh, with an oceanborne eye. An enveloping warmth, the spot of verglas marking her distant from the backdrop of red.  
阳光炽烈，她的目光如暴君般压迫，瞳孔在他心智的议会中激起灼热的焦虑。薄如纸的嘴唇，被心跳所掩，是对往昔时光的怀旧提醒。完美无瑕的肌肤，配以深邃如海洋的眼眸。一种环绕的温暖，冰花点清晰地标示出她与那片红色背景的距离。

Pretty as a picture. 美得像一幅画。

He imagined, vividly, some sort of future where sunlight could belong to freedom. Away from Earth. Away from him. She would probably be happier, having a universe to roam for millennia, no need to share an orbit with the scum of the Earth.  
他生动地想象着一种未来，阳光属于自由，远离地球，远离他。她或许会更快乐，拥有一个可以漫游千年的宇宙，无需与地球上的渣滓共享轨道。

A desolate planet, of which only he would roam.  
一颗荒芜的星球，唯有他独自徘徊。

Home.

"I'm home, Asuka." 我到家了，明日香。

Sunlight owned a vessel which the eighteenth angel had no right to witness; his stygian sins feasted upon concepts of touch. Connection. The sempiternal trace of his black on her akoya skin, softly quivering against the bumps of her breasts, the glow of her belly, and the potency of ash his flesh would bear. Eyes to lips, and with instinct, so much more. A hazed focus on his painting of her, a constant stimulus.  
阳光拥有一艘船，第十八位天使无权目睹；他那阴暗的罪孽在触感的概念上狂欢。连接。他黑色在她的 akoya 皮肤上永恒的痕迹，轻轻颤动在她胸部的凸起上，她腹部的光芒，以及他的肉体将承载的灰烬之力。从眼睛到嘴唇，以及本能，还有更多。他对她的画作的模糊焦点，持续的刺激。

Paper lips crumple, however. Her body couldn't conform to the role of his fireplace. It didn't deserve a fate that rime.  
然而，纸质的嘴唇会起皱。她的身躯无法适应成为他壁炉的角色，不值得承受那样的命运。

But there. That place, and that time. When the nemesis of red leashed the neck of sin. Where his spine burst into religion, crosses which bore his identity.  
但在那里，那个地方，那个时刻，红色的复仇之神束缚了罪恶的颈项。他的脊梁迸发出信仰，十字架承载着他的身份。

The locus where he felt his hair flash black. The season where daffodils began to wilt.  
他感受到发丝骤然变黑的那个地点。水仙花初露凋零之态的时节。

As such, they really did crumple. An abrupt alarm of all gifts and agonies which lips and bodies were birthed with.  
因此，它们确实崩溃了。所有礼物和痛苦的突然警报，这些礼物和痛苦是嘴唇和身体所孕育的。

Vocals, words. No matter what form, they always caused him pain. Words shouldn't have belonged to her. No human ever deserved the wrath, the pressure, the cornucopia of ruin which those paper lips could bring.  
人声与言辞，无论何种形式，总令他痛苦不堪。这些话语本不该属于她。没有任何人应承受那些纸唇所能带来的愤怒、压力和毁灭的种种。

But he did. 但他真的做了。

A triplet of messy notes:  
一串凌乱的笔记：

"Welcome home, monster." 欢迎回家，怪物。

A dying fireplace. 一间即将熄灭的壁炉。

---

Time was more fluid than first assumed, it seemed; her portrait disillusioned his already delicate mind. A momentary balance of stare to glare, evening the hitch of his breaths, the pearl of sweat running down his cheek, the cacophony of his heartbeat. Something from her to him, though be it a gift that never actually gave anything. Maybe it did try, though. Just maybe.  
时间似乎比最初设想的更为灵活多变；她的肖像打破了他的幻想，让本就敏感的心灵更加脆弱。那一刻，凝视与怒视达到了微妙的平衡，他的呼吸逐渐平稳，汗水沿着脸颊滑落，心跳声此起彼伏。她似乎传递给了他某种东西，尽管这份礼物实际上并未带来任何实质内容。或许，它确实曾试图传达些什么，只是或许而已。

An atmosphere of attention, all belonging to the pinnacle of them. Fear, heat, a cumbersome silence.  
一种全神贯注的氛围，一切都达到了极致。恐惧、热度，还有那沉重的静默。

Words. 词汇。

But connections break, of course, her grappling eye delaying itself to the beat of her body's dance. Adept in her work, just like always. Except this time, the assignment was tearing his mind to shreds. No doubt, an objective she would take her time with, flame dimming out over the precipitous burn of walkway lights.  
当然，连接会中断，她那敏锐的目光随着身体的舞动而迟疑。工作熟练，一如既往。只是这一次，任务让他心力交瘁。毫无疑问，她会慢慢来，火焰在人行道灯光的急速燃烧中逐渐黯淡。

From body to iron lines, his eyes followed the tracks in which she had sauntered. The one line acting as a gate from the tauntingly familiar colour inspiring his breath and skin, a barrier from their quarters. A line that used to distress him, until now. It was difficult at first, memory flushing him, with a new environment overtaking the greenery of which he was accustomed to. A garden of lessons, fruitful with life, and devoid of contact. A memory of haven. From wind to warmth, this apartment laid ingrained into his being.  
他的视线从身体延伸至铁线，追随着她曾经闲逛的路径。那条线如同一扇门，隔绝了那熟悉得令人恼怒的色彩，激发了他的呼吸与肌肤，成为他们住所的屏障。这条线曾令他困扰，但如今已不再。起初，记忆如潮水般涌来，新环境取代了他所熟悉的绿意。这是一个充满生命力的教训的花园，却缺乏人与人之间的接触。这是一个关于天堂的记忆。从风到温暖，这个公寓已深深融入他的生命。

If there was a single factor he would have taken away from this place, it was that warmth was fragile. So, promptly numb, he braved a step inside.  
若说他从这里带走的最深刻感受，便是温暖之脆弱。因此，他迅速让自己麻木，毅然踏入其中。

Pianissimo. 极弱音。

A muted hum of lustres kissed the stillness of a home he once associated with volume. Fronting, an oak-built getabako, misshapen with age and neglect. Time may have been fluid for them, but their burden hadn't seemed to have been shared across the acres of reality they thrived behind. The lights, ghastly painted dahlia, probably decayed from their disregard. As was everything. The fridge must have been an ugly sight. Or not, considering the only remains would be the solitary platforms of alcohol that their guardian would have left behind.  
一阵轻柔的嗡鸣声轻抚着这个曾经充满喧嚣的家中的静谧。前方，是一把因岁月和忽视而变形的橡木烟斗。对他们而言，时间或许是流动的，但他们的重担似乎并未在现实世界的广阔背后得到分担。灯光，如同鬼魅般的大丽花，大概已因他们的漠视而凋零。正如一切事物。冰箱必定是一幅丑陋的景象。或者也不一定，考虑到留下的唯一痕迹将是守护者留下的孤独的酒精平台。

And now, like a raid against his security, she arrived back into his mind. A vicious salt in the gaping gash of his structure, sempiternal in unwanted agonies. An explosion. A cross, more even to the others surrounding their burnt soil. Her poppy lipstick, an attempt to attract. Her efforts to galvanise him, ending only sexual.  
此刻，她如同一场突如其来的侵袭，再次闯入他的思绪。她的存在，如同在心灵的创伤上撒下苦涩的盐，无尽地折磨着他，带来难以承受的痛楚。她的出现，犹如一场心灵的爆炸，比周围那些烙印在焦土上的十字架更为强烈。她涂抹的罂粟色口红，试图吸引他的注意。然而，她所有的努力，最终都只停留在性的层面。

"We'll do the rest when you get back."  
等你回来，我们再继续处理剩下的部分。

Grotesque. Eyes aimed sinistrally, he escaped through movement.  
怪异之极。他斜视着左侧，借助移动悄然逃脱。

Through the dwindle of ancient gleams, a few dozen swarms of memoric frequencies his mind couldn't help but relapse to, he planted firmly at the ingress to his partner's whereabouts. A door of salvation, the guide to a house where only monsters roam. Or, perhaps, oblivion. Sunlight held ferocity far greater than any impact could usher onto their Earth.  
在古代光芒逐渐黯淡的过程中，他的思绪不由自主地回到了那些记忆频率的群集中，他坚定地站在通往伴侣所在地的入口。这扇门象征着救赎，引领至一个只有怪物徘徊的房屋，或许，也通向遗忘。阳光的猛烈程度远超过任何冲击能带给地球的。

Oblivion hath no fury as sunlight scorned.  
遗忘之怒不及阳光被轻视之痛。

An open gateway. A collapsing lung.  
一扇敞开的大门。一个正在塌陷的肺部。

His body, acting as a vanguard to a distraught screech of crimson floors, hitching. Dextral, a neurosis of hydrangea laid bare with twilight. A gloom aimed to another rose-kissed board, a belonging agreeing to a clash of images.  
他的身躯，如同先锋般引领着猩红地板上撕心裂肺的尖叫，颤抖不已。右旋，一丛绣球花的神经质在暮色中尽显无遗。一种阴郁的情绪瞄准了另一块被玫瑰亲吻过的木板，一种归属感同意了一场图像的冲突。

A spillage of freshly fixed caffeine. Also, a spillage of his guts.  
刚调好的咖啡洒了出来，同时，他的内脏也散落一地。

A complex of words, apologies, infected with the burning bile upheaving itself from his body's depths. More swarms, more, more and more; a teacher scraping their chalk asunder from the education of a blackboard, an elder trauma ripping through the confines of a recollection of a home as well as the fleshy restraint of his oesophagus. Liquid seething through eyelids of hateful youth, his senseless ache made recognised and dreaded, nevermind comparable.  
一连串充满歉意的词语，仿佛被体内深处涌出的炽热胆汁所感染。如同不断涌现的群集，一位教师从黑板的教育中刮去粉笔灰，一段旧日创伤撕裂了家的回忆以及他食道的肉体束缚。液体在充满恨意的年轻眼睑间沸腾，他那无意义的痛苦被认知并畏惧，无法与之相比。

Blubbering spouts of violence created only through the philanthropic instrument of his throat, unbidden in volume. A greed-green nose, eyes shifting rearwards, defying his body's nature.  
他的喉咙如同慈善的工具，无意间引发了暴力的泪水，音量无法自控。鼻头贪婪地泛绿，眼神向后游移，违背了身体的自然规律。

"Wake up, monster." “醒来吧，怪物。”

A stake in his heart's bloodied dance. A blinded man, with a blink, now awoken with a sore mind. A few more blinks, in fact, and his veins hadn't felt nearly as frayed. A visitation of eyes, a sacred stone to an ocean.  
他内心血腥舞蹈中的一根刺。一个盲人，眨眼间，带着痛苦的心灵苏醒。再眨几次眼，他的血管感觉就不那么紧绷了。眼睛的造访，对海洋而言，犹如一块神圣的石头。

Another lengthy visit, a frenzied trauma twisting his head to peak, from visionaries to umber coffee.  
又一次漫长的访问，狂乱的创伤将他的思绪推向极致，从预言家到琥珀色的咖啡。

It was gone. 它已经不见了。

No drug had spilt. No wood thrown, no tantrums for need. Stone met ocean one last time, an overbearing zeal forcing hope into his lungs. Hope for confusion, a confirmation that the concept of mutual strangulation was not shared in full. Sunlight, warmth, without her- what was he going to do? In the aquatic glow of hydrangea, an inkling of concern could surely arise.  
没有药物溢出，没有木头被扔，也没有因需求而发怒。石头最后一次与海洋相遇，一股强烈的激情将希望灌注进他的肺腑。他期待着混乱，希望确认相互窒息的概念并未被完全认同。阳光和温暖，若失去了她——他将何去何从？在绣球花的水色光辉中，一丝忧虑悄然萌生。

But her eye never shared such confirmations. Only one thing lingered on her body, from her ferocious waves down to the scarred pavement patterns engraved into her soles.  
然而，她的目光从未透露出这样的确认。唯一在她身上萦绕不去的，是从她狂烈的波澜到脚底那布满伤痕的路面纹理。

A forthright indifference.  
一种坦率的漠然态度。

Once more, his heart and hair flashed black. His warmth shattered, her vessel trapping him in his mind's labyrinth. Vision chiselled into place, he could only manage the audio of those torn feet marching into the comfort of the apartment washroom.  
他的心与发丝再次闪现黑色，温暖破碎，被她的躯体困在心灵迷宫。视野逐渐清晰，他仅能听见那些受伤的脚步踏入公寓洗手间的安慰之声。

His fingers rose to trace his lips, a new tension dispersing around his face. Then, another audio.  
他的手指缓缓抬起，轻抚过自己的唇，一种新的紧张情绪在他脸上逐渐散开。随后，又传来一段音频。

A traumatised smirk, amidst a perverted chuckle.  
一个带着创伤的假笑，混杂着扭曲的笑声。

Blink, and reality released in a waterfall against his system. He didn't deserve only a drip. An influx of uneven breaths released against the coated atmosphere the room drowned him with, his vomit swallowed as to not disturb the undressing of his other. After this, he couldn't face her. What he wanted, and all he needed, was the comfort of a duvet against bare skin, clothes still, unfortunately, bearing the unwanted mark of soul-strewn stew. A ruined comfort.  
一眨眼，现实如瀑布般冲击他的内心。他不应只承受点滴。不均匀的呼吸在房间弥漫的氛围中释放，他的呕吐被吞没，以免打扰到另一个人的更衣。此后，他无法面对她。他所渴望的，也是他唯一需要的，是裸露肌肤上被子的慰藉，但不幸的是，衣物仍残留着灵魂散落汤羹的不受欢迎的痕迹。这是一种被毁的安慰。

First, for any comfort at all, he would have to move. It seemed his statue had no intention of doing so.  
首先，为了得到哪怕一点舒适，他必须移动。然而，他的雕像似乎并没有这样的打算。

A rasped gasp for adrenaline fuelled his paralysed body onward, eyes now replacing the shape of her body with a rosy cotton floor; his crumbled ego attempted to bar his body from movement. His mind feared her results. If she arrived as he would escape, resonating in her reaction of abuse-  
肾上腺素激发的喘息声推动着他瘫痪的身体继续前行，眼中玫瑰色的棉质地板取代了她的身影；他破碎的自尊心试图阻止身体的移动。他的内心深处害怕她的反应。如果她如他所愿逃离，那虐待的回响将如何在她心中激荡——

Who did he even think she was? Of course, there would be no such abuse as before. No devastating sentences, no attempts to fight.  
他究竟把她看作什么人了？自然，不会再有从前那样的虐待。没有那些伤人的话语，也没有任何反抗的企图。

All there would be was indifference, a black heart, a red skyline-  
那里将只有冷漠，一颗漆黑的心，一片血红的天际线——

And a monster. 还有一只怪兽。

---

The scarlet glow of their keep radiated through the bare defence of his curtains, a wearied body of a fatigued boy collapsing onto his objective. Tan flesh bare, all clothing crumpled and tossed leisurely into a corner of the room in which he belonged. Upon contact, the soothing nature in which cotton kissed his flesh stemmed an abundance of comfortable sighs, something rare to be found in this form of Tokyo-3. Mindfulness returning, his visage twisted into satisfaction, a groan releasing into the sheets of his bedding.  
他们城堡的猩红光辉穿透了他窗帘的薄弱防御，一个疲惫的少年身体瘫倒在他的目标上。晒黑的肌肤裸露，所有衣物都随意地皱成一团，扔进了他所属房间的角落。一接触，棉质亲吻他肌肤的舒缓感引发了一连串舒适的叹息，这在东京-3 的这种形式中是罕见的。意识逐渐回归，他的面容扭曲成满足，一声呻吟释放到他的床单中。

He had found a fairly simple method to avoid the anxiety his ego had accumulated. Surely unhealthy, but at least a temporary fix against the pressure this Earth had set into his guts.  
他发现了一种相当简单的方法来避免自我积累的焦虑。尽管这种方法肯定不健康，但至少能暂时缓解地球给他内心带来的压力。

He merely had to abandon it. If only he had managed the will to perform such a feat during the ceremony of the third tribulation, maybe they wouldn't have been in this situation. Misato, a halved corpse. NERV as a whole, quartered and thrashed, a ruined company against the cataclysm of the third impact. Asuka, a mauve, gutted sun.  
他只需选择放弃。倘若他在第三次劫难的仪式上能鼓起勇气完成此举，或许他们就不会落得如此境地。美里，身躯被残忍地劈成两半。NERV 组织，支离破碎，遭受重创，成为第三次冲击浩劫下的牺牲品。明日香，如同一个被掏空内脏、黯淡无光的紫色太阳。

Asuka. 明日香。

With reality comes emotion. With emotion, remorse. A heart careening towards loneliness. This formless ode between them, existing invisible yet potent before them. Is this truly what was best? Is this what he wanted? A cursed apartment, on a blood-grown planet, with a slither of a chance that human willpower could overwhelm a need to stay as one. Individuality, instrumentality, the enemy of all he had come to recognise and adore.  
现实催生情感，情感带来悔恨，心灵正急速滑向孤独。在他们之间，这无形却强大的颂歌，虽不可见却真实存在。这真的是最佳选择吗？这是他所期望的吗？一个被诅咒的公寓，坐落于一个血色浸染的星球上，仅存一丝希望，人类的意志力能战胜保持一体的渴望。个性与工具性，这些他逐渐认识并深爱的对立面。

A new cross stabbed through his soul. Another religious torture, halving down to wings for unsound lies. To put an end to togetherness, or eliminate any wonders of another's thoughts and heartful intentions.  
一种新的痛苦如十字架般刺穿他的灵魂。这又是一种宗教折磨，将虚假的谎言化为无力的翅膀。为了终结共处，或是消除他人思想与真挚意图中的任何奇迹。

Which result would make him more of a monster?  
哪种结果会使他显得更像一个怪物？

Stone rolled over to a fronting desk. Another comfort found in metal, human creativity and musical joys. An owned portable transporter of all those noises which pleased him, from the awful procession of sampled beats to the intricate, detailed method in which musicians could slide their hands across a guitar. A former lover, in essence, and another fuel which used to invigorate him. Or, perhaps, a most terrifying escapism.  
石头滚到了前方的桌边。在这里，他找到了另一种慰藉，源自金属的质感、人类的创造力以及音乐带来的愉悦。这个便携式设备承载了他所钟爱的所有声音，从那些不尽人意的采样节拍，到音乐家们如何在吉他上灵巧地滑动手指的精妙技艺。它曾是他的旧爱，一种能激发他活力的源泉。然而，或许也是一种极其可怕的逃避现实的方式。

A vascular fist swept sheets into an agony-born hold. Confirmation of place, a texture preventing another descent. Insecurity plagued his breath. One more cross and his ego would vanish, not merely be replaced.  
一只如血管般的手猛地将床单卷入由痛苦生成的束缚之中。这一确认位置的动作，通过其独特的质感阻止了进一步的下降。不安全感如影随形，困扰着他的呼吸。只需再承受一个十字架的考验，他的自我便会彻底消失，而不仅仅是被替代。

Warmth, please come. 请带来些温暖。

And, almost on cue, a most peculiar event occurred. A shadow basked in the kingdom hum, illuminating a projection onto his naked comfort. Not exactly an invasion, yet not inviting either. Peculiar, because juxtaposing his account of her emotions, it seemed the sun had answered his request with blaring approval.  
而且，仿佛是应了某种暗示，一件极为奇异的事情发生了。一个影子沉浸在王国的低语声中，映照出他赤裸的安逸。这既非侵扰，也非邀请。之所以奇异，是因为这与他对她情感的叙述形成对比，仿佛太阳以响亮的赞同回应了他的请求。

Fatigue no longer an influence, his eyes brushed over the newly found radiance shining over him.  
疲劳已不再成为阻碍，他的目光轻轻掠过那新发现的光芒，照耀在他身上。

A brush to a stare. His body took the shock of her sight bluntly, and as such, reacted awestruck.  
一瞥变成凝视。他的身体直接承受了她目光的冲击，因此，表现出敬畏的反应。

Freshly dressed into a familiar overgrown lemon shirt, a newly unveiled body lay bleeding in front of him. Her scars, the remnant of the lance, and the failed attempt to reach out and avenge, had sown themselves back into a garden of fleshy wounds. An opponent to the dominance of red, teal dripped from each of her losses. A fluorescent atmosphere, with an angelical hum almost calm enough to send him to rest.  
她刚换上那件熟悉的超大柠檬衬衫，一具新暴露的身体便躺在他面前，鲜血淋漓。那些伤疤，是长矛留下的痕迹，以及那次未能伸出手去复仇的失败尝试，如今已重新长成了一片血肉模糊的伤口花园。与红色的主导地位抗争，青绿色从她的每一次失败中滴落。四周弥漫着一种荧光氛围，天使般的低吟几乎平静到足以让他安息。

But then, another waterfall. A sinking heart, a betrayal against his heart's dance forming itself as realisation set into his diaphragm.  
然而，眼前又是一处瀑布。他的心情随之沉落，仿佛内心的舞步被背叛，当意识到这一切时，这种感觉在他的横膈膜中逐渐成型。

A line of hydrangea, blooming across her wounds. A glue preventing her arm's separation, and a return into red. Gasps relented against the disconcert spiking his mind into action, a new bout of trauma ready to strangle and swarm him into endless submission. He blinked. Then, he blinked again. A new analysis, and the same answer.  
一排绣球花在她伤口上盛开，仿佛是一种胶水，防止她的手臂分离，并引领她回归血色。喘息声在令人不安的刺激下减弱，他的思绪被激发，新一轮的创伤正准备将他扼杀并淹没在无尽的屈服之中。他眨了眨眼，再次眨眼，进行新的分析，却得到了相同的答案。

The sun owned a garden, and the cost was her body.  
太阳拥有一座花园，而为此付出的代价是她的身体。

---

In his fourteen years of existence, and through the beautiful garden surrounding his rotted wooden home, he had come to recognise a superfluity of mesmerising shapes, sizes, poisons and blessings. Flowers.  
在他度过的这十四年中，通过环绕着他那腐朽木屋的美丽花园，他逐渐认识到了无数令人着迷的形状、大小、毒药和祝福。这些，都是花朵。

"They're the most beautiful form of life, aren't they?"  
“它们是最美丽的生命形态，对吧？”

A numb rambling, which his childish nature never allowed him to properly digest. Nevertheless, he persisted, listening to words that would allow him comprehension. His teacher continued, hands cradling his own, softly positioning them over the root of a simple burst of sea. "The hydrangea," his underdeveloped mind didn't seem to deter them, "a symbol of heart. Frigid, yet eternally bold, truly a spectacle among all the flowers here."  
一段杂乱无章的漫谈，他的稚嫩天性从未允许他真正消化。尽管如此，他仍坚持不懈，倾听那些能让他理解的话语。他的老师继续说，双手捧着他的手，轻轻地将它们放在一束简单的海浪根部。“绣球花，”他未成熟的心智似乎并未阻碍他们，“一颗心的象征。冰冷，却永远勇敢，真正是这里所有花中的奇观。”

A young stone met the maturity of another's vision. Forgotten, yet now unearthed, his face twisted to one of wonder, excitement, an illicit reaction to the bountiful colours belonging to his home. His caretaker's visage devised a smile. One that seemed somewhat sad, taking a breath to address some new fact for him to enjoy.  
一个年轻的石头见证了另一个石头视野的成熟。曾被遗忘，如今重见天日，他的面容因惊奇与兴奋而扭曲，对属于他家园的绚丽色彩产生了难以抑制的反应。他的看护人脸上露出了微笑，那微笑似乎带着些许哀伤，深吸一口气，准备向他揭示一些新的、令他愉悦的事实。

"You see these blues?" 你注意到这些蓝色了吗？

A nod. 微微点头。

"These, child, are signs of death. A true symbol of pathos, respected in Japan as a most delicate life. You respect these, and virtue may bless you."  
孩子，这些是死亡的象征。在日本，它们被视为生命的精致体现，受到尊重。尊重它们，美德可能会眷顾你。

For his child, the fantastical nature of the garden filled him only with dreams of an Earth kissed with such blessings. Greenery, humanity, life-  
对于他的孩子，花园的奇幻之美让他满怀憧憬，梦想着地球也能沐浴在这样的恩泽之中。绿意盎然，充满人性，生机勃勃——

Everything they now lacked. Returning to his present, these flowers gored his mind, as well as her body. Respect, the one thing he remembered a need for, was nowhere to be found in his system.  
他们现在所欠缺的一切。回到现实，这些花朵不仅刺痛了他的心灵，也刺痛了她的身体。尊重，他记得曾经需要的东西，在他的内心世界里却无处可寻。

---

Formerly her eye socket, one of the hydrangea escaped the lance's punishment, with each deformation containing a luminous combination of prussian blues and lavender edges. They pulsed in the same dance as her heart, the hum only increasing in volume and magnitude with each heated drop of brilliance. A tranquillity unmatched, the compression of red overwhelmed by its beauty.  
曾经是她的眼窝，如今一朵绣球花逃过了长矛的摧残，每一次变形都闪耀着普鲁士蓝与薰衣草边缘的绚丽组合。这些光芒与她的心跳同步跳动，嗡嗡声随着每一滴炽热的光辉而愈发响亮。这种宁静之美，让红色的压迫感在其面前显得微不足道。

For him, although perhaps harrowing, it was absolutely mesmerising. The sway of her body as she braved a further step towards him, and then another, the musical hum calming and settling along with her movements. And then him, a statue. Closer, and he had never realised angels could hold such a lovely nature. Even closer, and each drip of oceanic essence now connected with the bare flesh of his forearm. A body of hushed elegance hung before him, mythical in concept in consideration of the identity of who was enticing him.  
对他而言，尽管过程或许令人心痛，却也绝对令人着迷。她勇敢地向他迈进一步，再一步，身体随之摇曳，那如音乐般的低吟随着她的动作而平静下来。而他，宛如一尊静止的雕像。距离更近了，他从未意识到天使竟能拥有如此迷人的本质。再靠近些，每一滴海洋的精华此刻都与他的前臂肌肤紧密相连。一个充满静谧优雅的身躯出现在他眼前，考虑到诱惑他的人的身份，这情景宛如神话般不可思议。

Identity. 身份识别。

"Kaworu?" 渚薰吗？

Corrosion. 腐蚀现象。

Another swarm. A grim reminder of severed skulls, the most angelic of gore designed for a coward's anguish. Tears, acceptance of hope. The hope to say "I love you", a forthcoming advent descending before two could become one.  
又是一群。这景象如同断头骷髅般令人心寒，是最为天使化的血腥场景，专为懦夫的痛苦而设计。泪水，是对希望的接纳。那份希望，是想要说出“我爱你”，一个即将到来的时刻，在两人融为一体之前降临。

Their becoming of love. The most heavenly way to die.  
他们爱情的萌生。最为神圣的离世之道。

An enveloping need embraced him and manipulated his nature completely. A need for warmth. Comfort. Help. For now, he was unaware. Unaware of words. Unaware of identity. Love was destructive.  
一种全面包围的需求紧紧抓住了他，彻底改变了他的本性。他渴望温暖、舒适和援助。此刻，他浑然不觉，对语言和自我身份毫无认知。爱，具有毁灭性。

"I was right. Anyone would do for you."  
我没错，对你而言，任何人都可以。

Femininity leaked through, and sunlight unveiled herself once more.  
女性气质悄然流露，阳光再次展现她的光辉。

A final blink. 最终的眨眼。

---

His body turned horizontal. Sunlight's vessel nuzzled against his own naked back, hand tracing the glow of his belly, lips softly planting themselves over his nape, and hands of hydrangea placed just barely over his adam's apple. An unnatural warmth, somehow more forthright than his concepts of her ever managed to be.  
他的身体平躺下来，阳光仿佛一艘小船，轻轻依偎在他裸露的背上，手指顺着他腹部的光晕滑动，嘴唇温柔地贴在他的后颈，而那双如同绣球花般的手，则轻柔地搭在他的喉结上。这种温暖显得有些不自然，却比他心中对她的任何想象都要来得直接和真切。

"Monster," 怪兽，

Paper lips shifted. 纸做的嘴唇动了动。

"What do you prefer to say? Anything and everything, or everything and anything?"  
你倾向于怎么说？是任何事和所有事，还是所有事和任何事？

Words without pain. For him, a rare occasion.  
言语中没有痛苦。对他而言，这是难得的片刻安宁。

"Everything and anything, I think."  
我想，一切的一切，无所不包。

A thoughtless answer. 一个未经深思熟虑的回答。

"Oh. You're boring." 哦，你真是无趣。

A lovely giggle. 一阵悦耳的笑声。

Another silence. Another tightening grip.  
再次陷入沉默。再次感受到紧握的力量。

"Goodnight, Asuka." 晚安，明日香。

Warmth. 温馨。

A few more messy notes:  
这里还有几条杂乱的笔记：

"Goodnight, monster." 晚安，小怪兽。

A crumbling home. 一座破败不堪的房子。

With a fresh breed of lungs, and a moon-stricken ego, he had found himself a crooked solace.  
他拥有清新的肺叶和被月光触动的自我，从而找到了一种扭曲的慰藉。

Awoken anew, antebellum to shallow frost, he found a thread of brain. A thread to a knot, and a knot to a pretty pink bow, morning grace holding about as much regard as everything else did. A pair of cherry-seethed curtains, a sky still nightly. His musical comfort, a metal no longer containing the 25-26 loop accustomed to his ears. Vision, a spiral downward.  
他再次醒来，感受到战前的薄霜，发现脑海中有一丝线索。这线索连结成一个结，再变成一个精致的粉红色蝴蝶结，晨光的恩赐与其他事物一样被同等对待。房间里是一对散发着樱桃香气的窗帘，外面的天空仍笼罩在夜色中。他熟悉的音乐慰藉，那不再包含 25-26 循环的金属声，视野则如螺旋般向下延伸。

A new everything, and a warmth for warmth.  
一切都是全新的，温暖与温暖相交换。

Only a most beautiful garden.  
仅此一座极其美丽的花园。

Cloaked with the warm keep of his duvet, a thickness soliciting their joined flesh with joyful, playful connection. Lessons, memory taught him, had made a tie between an event before sleep, and the morning thereafter. You'd remember the minutes prior to slumber, sounds of chalk keeping him aware of the fact, and in the morning, that memory would remain the most present of the day before. No matter how much you forget, what your eyes whisper before slumber would always persist. A use-cut purpose of human minds.  
他裹在温暖的被窝里，那种厚实的触感以欢乐而俏皮的方式召唤着他们紧贴的肌肤。记忆告诉他，睡前发生的事情与次日早晨之间形成了一种联系。你会记得入睡前的瞬间，粉笔声让他保持清醒，到了早晨，那段记忆会成为前一天最清晰的片段。无论你忘记多少，入睡之前眼睛所传递的信息总会持续存在。这是人类思维的一种巧妙运用。

But with a mind so benign, more appreciative of flora than humanity, ugliness of titles forced his memory into a dilemma.  
然而，他心性温良，对花草的喜爱甚于人类，那些不雅的称谓却让他的记忆陷入了两难。

His heart, his hand, his being- they all balanced the line between man and monster.  
他的内心、行动以及存在，都在人与怪物之间找到了平衡点。

He wasn't sure which side would make him slip.  
他无法确定哪一边会使他失足滑倒。

Memory before slumber: 沉睡之前的记忆：

"Goodnight, monster." 晚安，小怪兽。

Still yet benign. 依旧和善。

It remained there. A memory of a mind more calm than the one that these supposed "mornings" brang. There was no sun for morning to arrive, of course. This Earth, now marred and ashen, could never bear light. Only moonlight, forevermore, a signature for his sin. His crosses to carry.  
它依旧停留在那里，是一段比这些所谓的“早晨”所唤醒的更为宁静的心境记忆。当然，这些早晨并没有太阳升起。如今这满目疮痍、灰烬般的地球，已无法承载光明。唯有月光永恒，成为他罪孽的印记，是他必须背负的十字架。

A gentle stroke. his hand meandered through barely-dried rivers of flushed hair, the form in which the sun now takes. Seafire, brimming with teal desire, and one owned flower blooming upon his hands of black.  
轻柔的抚摸。他的手在刚干的发丝间缓缓游走，仿佛太阳此刻的化身。海火般深邃，充满着青蓝的渴望，而他手中那朵独一无二的花正绽放着。

The sun owned a garden,  
太阳拥有一个美丽的花园，

"The cost is your body, Asuka."  
代价是你自己的身体，明日香。

"Silence is a virtue, monster."  
沉默是一种美德，怪物。

Sometimes, he couldn't wait to burn it down.  
有时，他恨不得立刻将其付之一炬。

---

The only possible connection he could acknowledge from then-on, apparently, was the tick of a house clock nestling itself in his ears. Dimly ignored, yet ferocious in an attempt to keep the boy from residing in slumber, as rest seemed an impossibility without her warmth anymore. She had left him there, in a half-made deathbed. Probably scouring for anything they could use to survive, sustenance to maintain physicality between them. Practical as ever, the better child of the two.  
自那时起，他似乎只能感受到家中时钟的滴答声，轻柔地萦绕在耳畔。尽管这声音被不经意地忽略，却顽强地阻止着男孩沉入梦乡，因为失去了她的温暖，安眠已变得遥不可及。她将他遗留在半成品的临终之榻上，或许正四处搜寻任何能助他们生存的物资，以维系彼此间的实体联系。她始终如此务实，无疑是两个孩子中更为出色的一位。

In the emptiness, he recalled the night through his longing. The only ignorance he could admit was blissful, the focus on her newly-grown petals, the stench of petrichor upon her body as she perched upon his. But hers-  
在空寂之中，他借着渴望回想起那个夜晚。他唯一能坦然接受的无知是种幸福，全神贯注于她新绽的花瓣，她依偎在他身上时散发出的泥炭苔气息。然而，她的——

He forgot how dizzying her form truly was.  
他忘了她的身姿有多么令人眼花缭乱。

Form.

Identity. 身份识别。

"Kaworu?" 渚薰吗？

How dare he revile that name.  
他怎敢如此诋毁那个名字。

Frenzy consumed him for a moment, a mixture of lilac and blood pulsing through his mind, bile shooting up and escaping the disgusting mouth in which an angel's name was written, branded, carved. Coughing couldn't solve it, and neither could suppressing it, his wilted mind recalling the ultimate form of regicide his hand and heart performed.  
那一刻，他陷入了狂乱，脑海中紫罗兰与血的混合脉动汹涌澎湃，胆汁上涌，从那张刻有天使名字、烙印的令人作呕的嘴里喷涌而出。咳嗽和压抑都无法解决问题，他枯萎的心灵回想起那双手和心脏所执行的终极弑君之举。

Even as a giant, he couldn't help but notice how fragile the grey-haired ego seemed. One squeeze, one pop, and the enemy of humanity would fall to a monster's grasp. Retaliation was impossible. Sanguine eyes rested upon ones of stone, ones of stoic travesty not handled and not cradled enough to realise the severity of his actions.  
即便身为巨人，他也难以忽视那灰发人自尊的脆弱。只需轻轻一捏，一声脆响，人类的敌人便将落入怪物的掌控。报复无从谈起。血红的目光落在那些石质的、坚忍而未被足够呵护的眼眸上，未能意识到其行为后果的严重性。

Time disobeyed order. 时间违背了指令。

Minutes. Hours. Maybe months, maybe years- yearning eyes never faltered in connection. his breaths were shallow, false, an imitation of a human system.  
分秒流逝，或许是数月，或许是数年，那双充满渴望的眼睛始终未曾动摇。他的呼吸浅薄而虚伪，仿佛是对人类生命机制的拙劣模仿。

He loved him. the first fireplace to stoke his heart.  
他深爱着他，那第一座壁炉如同点燃了他内心的火焰。

But then he wilted. A head dropped into soul-foul liquid, the embrace of life, the fiber of humanity.  
然而，他随即变得萎靡。一颗头颅沉入污浊的液体，那是生命的拥抱，人性的脉络。

Another fireplace died. 又一炉火熄灭了。

Flashes; 闪烁；

An angel's skull. 天使的头骨。

A mother's kiss. 妈妈的一吻。

A scapegoat's corpse. 替罪羊的遗骸。

The bile nestled deep inside of his throat, paused, steadfast in release. He pondered on all in which he had seen, a mind begotten. He didn't want it anymore. This crimson kingdom, this rotting home; they had already bound him to his past. Yet, his mind won't stop. Won't stop begging for help, snivelling, crying out for some semblance of warmth.  
胆汁深藏于他喉咙深处，暂停，坚定地等待释放。他沉思着所见所闻，心中孕育着思想。他已不再渴望这些。这个血色的王国，这个腐朽的家；它们已将他与过去紧紧相连。然而，他的思绪无法停止。不断乞求帮助，抽泣着，呼喊着寻求一丝温暖。

"Burn it all." 全部烧毁。

An angel's voice- 天使般的嗓音——

What?

"Your sunlight, your garden, this planet, these crosses, your kingdom, your life, the tips of your hair which get longer with every passing day, this pause of age never allowing you freedom, all which causes you pain."  
你的阳光，你的花园，这个星球，这些十字架，你的王国，你的生命，你发梢日渐增长，这段年龄的停顿从不给你自由，所有这些给你带来痛苦的事物。

Bile to vomit, his mind defiled his body, a putrid gash flowing out in the boy's room through ceaseless screaming, unsettling the very room with ear-ravaging slaughter. His body bare, he sprinted to the comfort of the apartment washroom, the crimson of the floor marring his mind still with images he couldn't accept. Oak doors, crashed, destroyed, his body barrelling through his home to find anyplace he can discard his stomach as a whole, the sickness never releasing its grasp onto his structure.  
胆汁涌动，欲吐难止，他的心灵侵蚀着身体，在男孩的房间里，一道腐臭的伤口伴随着不绝于耳的尖叫声流出，刺耳的喧嚣扰乱了整个空间。他赤身裸体，急奔至公寓卫生间的慰藉之地，地板上的血红痕迹仍在脑海中挥之不去，那些他无法接受的画面。橡木门被撞得支离破碎，他的身体在家中四处冲撞，只为找到一个可以彻底抛弃胃部的地方，那疾病始终紧紧缠绕着他。

His hands clenched against the aging white of the toilet, his mouth flowing with soulborn stew. LCL leaked from every hole it could: eyes, nose, mouth, ears- vomit was the incorrect assumption for whatever process seemed to infect his body.  
他的双手紧握着那老化发白的马桶，嘴里流淌着仿佛由灵魂孕育出的浓汤。LCL 从他能渗入的每一个孔洞中流出：眼睛、鼻子、嘴巴、耳朵——呕吐并非是他身体所经历的异常过程的正确描述。

It never stopped. 它一直未曾停歇。

He wouldn't let it. 他绝不会允许这件事发生。

In a moment of brevity, however, the discharge seemed to settle. His mind less frayed, frenzy only owning a portion of his desire. In, out, his breaths took massive breaks, strides in making sure asphyxiation didn't tear him away. Breaths of exhaustion, unsettled, a berserk body with a mind calm enough to adjust to reason.  
然而，在那一刻的短暂中，释放似乎稳定了下来。他的思绪不再那么纷乱，狂热只占据了他欲望的一部分。他的呼吸深沉而有力，确保窒息不会将他夺走。疲惫的呼吸，不安定，一个狂暴的身体却有着足够冷静的头脑来适应理性。

Brave, he stared into the mirror of shower reflections. He needed to see himself, to affirm his being, that he was intact, that angels really could stay lifeless.  
他勇敢地凝视着淋浴间的镜像，需要通过这种方式来确认自己的存在，证明自己完好无损，天使确实能保持静止不动。

But as he stared, 然而，当他凝视着时，

An angel stared back. 一位天使回眸凝视。

Sanguine eyes on stone, grey strings on blackened ones. Memoirs of love, of warmth, of a fireplace still in front of him. A sudden acceptance, a sudden reliance. A string of red lacing a thin, androgynous neck, a reminder of god's sacred regicide.  
石上血眼，灰线缠黑。爱之回忆，温暖如昔，壁炉仍在眼前。骤然接受，骤然依赖。红线轻绕纤细中性颈间，暗喻神之神圣弑君。

The boy's heart slacked a beat. A heart arrhythmic in symphony. A body still demanding rest, his exhaustion didn't stop love's infection creeping into his being.  
男孩的心跳漏了一拍，心律不齐如同错乱的交响乐。尽管身体仍渴望休息，他的疲惫却无法阻挡爱的感染悄然渗入他的内心。

Tears unshackled from his form, each stroke of liquid only stretching his nostalgia further. A grin born of lovely nature.  
泪水从他身上挣脱，每一滴都加深了他的怀旧之情。一个因美好本性而生的微笑。

"Is that you, Kaworu?" 是你吗，渚薰？

An angel's reflection: 天使的映像：

"Burn it all." 全部烧毁。

If he could talk to anyone, he could have sworn his hair got a little blacker.  
如果他能与任何人交谈，他几乎可以肯定自己的头发变得更黑了一些。

---

His body must have stayed there for eons. There, emasculated, desperately clawing at his oesophagus. Surreptitious even to himself, the lack of action to move, to brave a step, to hark back. He scarcely felt the need to vomit anymore. Instead, he only furthered his vision below him, staring fractured at the pustules of souls that had escaped him. His heart was still arrhythmic, barely pumping his body to life. Necrose his body, neurotic his mind; the rot of the room never offered any solace either.  
他的躯体或许已在原地停留了无数岁月，无助而绝望地抓挠着自己的食道，连自己都未曾察觉的隐秘，未曾采取任何行动去移动，去勇敢迈步，去回忆过往。他几乎不再感到呕吐的冲动，只是更加专注地凝视着下方，那些从他身边逃离的灵魂脓包。他的心跳依旧不规律，勉强维持着生命的迹象。身体逐渐坏死，心智陷入疯狂；房间的腐朽也从未给予他任何慰藉。

His eyes moved sinistral. The angel remained. Wearing a faux smile upon his attractive lips, tracking him, hunting him down with the tug of mauve muscle around his neck the only evidence of history between them. Blood soaked the reflection's eyes, owning the same maternity the boy once felt consolation in. His eyes burned from the sight. The intensity was palpable. The lack of humanity even more so. A bonfire, so close to him, ready to warm him only if he obeyed the tempest of desire residing inside of him.  
他的目光转向左侧，而天使依旧伫立。他那迷人的唇边挂着虚伪的微笑，紧盯着他，脖颈周围淡紫色肌肉的牵扯成了他们过往的唯一痕迹。鲜血浸染了倒影的双眼，蕴含着男孩曾寻求慰藉的相同母性。眼前的景象令他双眼灼痛。紧张的氛围触手可及，人性的缺失更是昭然若揭。一团篝火近在咫尺，只待他屈从于内心欲望的风暴，便能给予他温暖。

But that was karma, Kaworu. The tracks he tip-toed, the massacre he incurred, the red of his kingdom.  
但那是因果报应，渚。他小心翼翼走过的路，他引发的屠戮，他王国的血色。

He was still in that train. He was still building that sand castle.  
他依然在那列火车上。他依然在搭建那座沙堡。

Words, this red planet, all which he loved, sunlight in the sempiternal moon-  
言语，这红色星球，他珍爱的一切，月光中永恒的阳光-

"Burn it down." 烧毁它。

It was cold. It was so, so cold.  
天气冷极了。真是冷得刺骨。

Humbuzz of shower fans were tumultuous against his comfort. They affirmed his fears of loneliness, of his lack of warmth. Immobilised, his senses scrambled, his rested body attempted to focus on any escape it could possibly find.  
淋浴风扇的嗡嗡声在他耳边喧嚣，加剧了他的不适。这些声音证实了他对孤独和缺乏温暖的恐惧。他动弹不得，感官混乱，休息过的身体试图专注于任何可能的逃离方式。

Eyes, a toilet infected. 眼睛，一处被感染的厕所。

Mouth, a taste of stomach waste.  
口中尝到了胃里的废物。

Nose, the rot of a crumbling room.  
鼻子，象征着一间正在崩塌的房间的腐朽气息。

Hands, a pale, dusty surface.  
双手，苍白且覆盖着尘土的表面。

Ears;

The creak of an opening door.  
门开启时发出的吱吱声。

And in abrupt nature, the boy recalled,  
男孩回忆起那突如其来的自然景象，

He started feeling a little warmer.  
他开始感到一丝暖意。

"Asuka.." 明日香……

Louder. 再大声些。

"Asuka." 明日香。

Her footsteps were tender.  
她的步伐轻盈。

"Asuka, please.." 明日香，拜托了……

They only grew closer. Fanatic, his pleads followed in volume.  
他们之间的关系愈发紧密。他狂热地提高恳求的音量。

"Asuka.. Asuka .. Asuka, Asuka, Asuka, Asuka, Asuka, Asuka-  
明日香，明日香，明日香，明日香，明日香，明日香，明日香，明日香——

He yearned for her shadow. He yearned for sunrise.  
他对她的身影心驰神往，对日出充满期盼。

"Asuka, please, hold me.."  
明日香，求你抱紧我……

And eventually, he got what he wished for.  
最终，他如愿以偿。

Hydrangea pulsed through the room, a glow bastardising all which he had become comfortable with over the millennia he had spent with his fingers down his throat. The hum soon followed, diluted and falsified through pure petrichor. Her silhouette, slanted, feminine, diminishing his presence with struggling repression.  
绣球花的脉动弥漫整个房间，那光芒扭曲了他数千年来通过自虐所习惯的一切。紧接着是嗡嗡声，被纯粹的 petrichor 稀释和伪造。她的身影倾斜而柔美，以挣扎的压抑削弱了他的存在感。

"Hold you?" 要抱住你吗？

He cried. She giggled. 他哭了，而她则咯咯地笑。

"That's ironic, monster."  
“真是讽刺，怪物啊。”

But then, she held him anyway.  
尽管如此，她最终还是紧紧抱住了他。

---

He almost forgot how sunlight felt.  
他差点忘了阳光照在身上的感觉。

The warmth of her embrace, her subtle claws keeping him close, resolute in never once leaving a chance for respite. Her petals- each dripped with seafire, the garden blooming across her body pulsating from his contact. A celestial body, each flower oscillated and rumbled in a myriad of directions, tendrils moving in and out of her body with each passing breath. They brustled against his face, tickled his nose, garden petrichor relaxing his almost paralysed form. Ever the brute, her vigour enticed him more than her form already had, his body judiciously fitting her form. Entranced, illusioned, the rapture of the two moved, her legs sustaining his weight with delicate indifference. It felt more like a dance, but then again, his mind had already felt like it was spinning.  
她拥抱的温暖，那微妙的爪子紧紧抓住他，决意不给他任何喘息的机会。她的花瓣——每一瓣都闪烁着海火的光芒，花园在她身上盛开，因他的触碰而脉动。她如同一个天体，每朵花在各个方向上摇曳生姿，卷须随着每一次呼吸在她体内穿梭。它们轻抚他的脸庞，逗弄他的鼻尖，花园的清新气息让近乎瘫痪的他感到放松。她那野性的活力比她的形态更令他着迷，他的身体恰到好处地契合她的轮廓。沉醉其中，幻象迭生，两人的激情交织，她的双腿轻盈地承载着他的重量。这更像是一场舞蹈，尽管他的思绪早已如旋风般翻腾。

Her flesh felt comfortable. Her lungs did too, each inhale and exhale reassuring his existence, as well as her presence. He nestled into her neck, mumbling false words of gratitude, appreciating each pore of her body, each pale scale he forgot to kiss. A paradigm of humanity; he was right, she earnestly belonged to the title of the better child.  
她的肌肤触感宜人，肺部亦然，每一次呼吸都仿佛在确认他的存在与她的在场。他蜷缩在她的颈窝，低声细语着虚伪的感谢，细细品味她身体的每一寸肌肤，每一处他疏忽未吻的苍白鳞片。他体现了人性的典范；他的确没错，她真心实意地配得上“更优秀的孩子”这一美誉。

Even on his side, placed against the sanctuary of a bed, he couldn't take his stone visionaries off of her. The perfection of her hips, the warmth of her midriff, the memory of her scent- he was warm. Despite his lack of clothes, naked in stark contrast to his partner, he was just so warm. Connection, his body surmised more so than his mind, rendered him incandescent.  
即便侧卧在床的圣洁之地，他的目光也如石化般无法从她身上移开。她臀部的完美曲线，她腰腹的温暖触感，以及她气息的记忆，都让他感到无比温暖。尽管他一丝不挂，与衣着整齐的伴侣形成鲜明对比，他却沉浸在这份温暖之中。身体的感受比心智更为强烈，这种联系让他仿佛散发着光芒。

She was lovely. 她非常可爱。

"What clothes do you want?"  
你想穿什么样的衣服？

He didn't own the strength to reply.  
他无力回应。

A huff escaped her lips, belittling, yet only attractive to his structure. They didn't own the same chap his lips did, ripe and inviting his body forwards. Tar against beige.  
她轻蔑地哼了一声，但这只增添了他的魅力。他们的嘴唇并不相同，他的饱满诱人，仿佛在召唤身体靠近。焦黑与米色的鲜明对比。

Ripping through her closet, aged and near enough withered, she gowned him in clothes more manly than he would have expected from her. Briefs, a simple rogue hoodie- it didn't matter. Her scent was everywhere, hydrangea redolence struggling to sedate his current addiction. It only made him dizzier, wanting more, never once wanting to touch the ground. It seemed she'd respond in answer to his desire, cradling him in her arms once more.  
她翻遍了衣橱，衣物虽已陈旧，近乎凋零，却出乎意料地为他穿上了更显阳刚的衣装。无论是内裤还是简单的连帽衫，这些都不重要。她的气息弥漫四周，绣球花的香味试图安抚他此刻的瘾，结果却让他更加晕眩，愈发渴望，一刻也不愿回到现实。仿佛她能感应到他的渴望，再次温柔地将他抱在怀中。

For a reason unbeknownst to him, they had both left the premises of their rotted apartment. Outside, decrepit gusts of air confirming to him, didn't fair much better than the apartment. This kingdom was still stained red. A decay unique to their home, a contradiction to her teal hue, he couldn't bear the sight of it.  
不知为何，他们俩都离开了那间破败的公寓。外面的风同样显得破旧不堪，情况并不比公寓内好多少。这个王国依旧被染成红色，一种他们家园特有的衰败景象，与她那青绿色的色调形成鲜明对比，他实在无法忍受这样的景象。

He missed the beach. The sand owned more comfort than this crimson skyline.  
他错过了海滩，那里的沙滩比这片绯红的天际线更能带来慰藉。

Still treated with utmost fragility, her warmth placed him upon a steady chair overlooking the balcony, vision hastily blackening with eyelids clamming shut. Scopophobia, no matter the lack of eyes nearby, still berated him with its dark promise. The towers had eyes. Scrapes in the sky, they caved in on his being, inverting his flesh, emptying him from inside and out. This rose-tinted planet, all a result of him, the ring of souls surrounding and flooding his neurosis with bitter afterthought-  
尽管她仍被视为极度脆弱，她的温暖却让他安坐在阳台边一张稳固的椅子上，视野随着眼睑紧闭而迅速变暗。恐镜症，即便周围并无目光，仍以它黑暗的承诺不断折磨着他。那些塔楼仿佛有眼睛，天空中的划痕压迫着他的存在，扭曲了他的肉体，从内外将他掏空。这个玫瑰色的星球，一切皆因他而起，灵魂的环绕让他沉浸在苦涩的反思中，淹没了他的神经症。

"Open your eyes, wimp." 睁开眼吧，胆小鬼。

It's strange, isn't it? How love ashes our fears away.  
这很奇妙，不是吗？爱情竟能将我们的恐惧一扫而空。

A gradual slope, through will of love and such silly ideals, his eyes simmered over the sight of all that had become theirs.  
一个缓缓倾斜的坡地，因爱意和那些天真理想，他的目光温柔地覆盖了这一切，它们已属于他们。

Just a day before, this very same balcony traumatised him. The cognizance of his actions, the religion upon his back, all the crosses blooming across lamplight street scenes weighing down his form, his mind, his warmth.  
就在前一天，这个阳台还让他心有余悸。他意识到自己的行为，背负着宗教的重担，那些在路灯下街景中盛开的十字架，重重地压在他的身形、心灵和温暖上。

Though, a day never held much impact. Time was fluid, a liar, a deceiver they couldn't obey anymore.  
然而，每一天都未曾带来太多影响。时间如同变幻莫测的流水，是个不可信的欺骗者，他们已无法再顺从它。

For the world in front of him, the brotherly bond of man and monster occupying his mind, a singular question came to mind. Struggling even to crane his neck, only grit delivered his hand upon the fireplace beside him.  
在他眼前的世界里，人与怪兽间的兄弟情谊萦绕心头，一个独特的问题悄然浮现。他竭力扭动脖子，唯有坚毅的意志才让他的手触及了身旁的壁炉。

"Do you ever wish you were a canvas?"  
你是否曾希望自己能成为一块画布？

Curiosity doesn't comply with knowledge.  
好奇心并不顺从知识。

"No, idiot. I don't think this is something you'd want to paint."  
“不，笨蛋。我觉得这不是你想画的东西。”

Her words overruled his own. Or, at least, the haze of them did, her voice owning enough comfort to swoon him.  
她的话语超越了他的声音，至少那朦胧的部分如此，她温柔的语调足以令他陶醉。

It took a while for anything else to come out his mouth. He gulped down his soul-phlegm, resisting his illness if only for a moment of peace between them. He never realised sunlight could look so brilliant in the shade of the moon.  
他沉默良久才再次出声。他强忍着内心的不适，只为在他们之间寻得片刻宁静，暂时抵御病痛的侵袭。他未曾料想，月光下的阳光竟能显得如此耀眼。

For a few moments, he welcomed memories back into his form. Only a short while, half a second at most, enough to hark back to a time before cherry garnished the entirety of their soil.  
有那么片刻，他让记忆重新涌入心间。仅仅是一瞬之间，至多半秒，足以让他追忆起樱桃尚未点缀他们土地的往昔。

A kitchen. Lights, a deadpan yellow, homely in its ignorant glare over the two children. One, a sickly red polo. The other, an oversized tee. Both linked, both connected, lips to lips, each fearing the presence of a false mother. A false family. Identities, each an image, a portrayal, never real, never truthful.  
厨房里，昏黄的灯光无心地照亮着两个孩子，营造出一种家的氛围。一个孩子穿着病态的红色马球衫，另一个则穿着过大的 T 恤。他们紧密相连，唇齿相依，心中都害怕那个假母亲的出现。这个虚假的家庭，每个人的身份都只是表象，从未真实，从未真诚。

Who even was he anymore?  
他现在究竟是谁了？

"Asuka," 明日香，

A new question plagued him. A cancer, eating away at his mind, the only cross too heavy to harbour. Dementia owned its perks, after all.  
一个新的问题不断困扰着他，如同一种侵蚀心灵的癌症，沉重得难以承受。然而，痴呆也并非全无益处。

But the tightrope of identity did not.  
然而，身份的平衡之绳并未松懈。

"What is my name?" 我叫什么名字？

Sunlight paused in her shape. Her petals ceased to pulse, breaths hitching in an uneven tempo of slack-beats and blood pumps. She laid still, silent in wake.  
阳光在她身形中凝固。她的花瓣不再颤动，呼吸在不规则的松弛节奏和血液流动中中断。她静卧着，清醒却无声。

She cracked a step towards him.  
她朝他迈出了一步。

Then, rested atop him. Heavenly in shape, his neurotic measures had ceased in their attack. Scarcely any weight. In his mind, the final angel.  
随后，她安然躺在他身上。她的身姿宛如天仙，他那神经质的举动已不再侵扰。几乎感觉不到她的重量。在她心中，她是最后的仙女。

She seized his hands, 她紧紧握住了他的双手，

Placed them over her throat–  
将它们置于她的喉部——

"You're a monster. That's all you ever will be."  
“你就是个怪物，永远都是。”

His heart, his hand, his being- they all balanced the line between man and monster.  
他的内心、行动以及存在，都在人与怪物之间找到了平衡点。

But now he was sure,  
但现在他坚信不疑，

"Burn it all." 全部烧毁。

He had slipped. 他不慎滑了一跤。

"You heard her, right?" 你听到了她的话，对吧？

Ashen hair hadn't made the reflection any clearer, or any more facile. Similar to the blackened thatch pelting over his own face, the angel's eyes had been covered as well. But that was much better than some shared contact of their vision- he didn't know if he actually wanted to see those sanguine bulbs once more. They didn't suit his needs. He only wanted a few words, not a peek.  
灰白的头发并未使倒影更为清晰或更易处理。如同他脸上覆盖的黑色茅草，天使的眼睛同样被遮蔽。然而，这总比他们视觉的直接接触要好——他不确定自己是否还想再次直视那对血红色的眼眸。它们并不符合他的需求。他只求寥寥数语，而非窥视一眼。

"She said it herself, you know. I'm a monster. 'That's all you'll ever be'."  
“她亲口说的，你知道。我是个怪物。‘你永远只能这样了’。”

Gradually, his eyelids must have clamped over themselves; it was no surprise, the day had been quite cumbersome. The week had been tiring. A little cold, the house owning a small chill whenever she was out there, plundering and sending homes asunder in her desire to find sustenance for them both.  
渐渐地，他的眼皮必定是紧紧闭合了；这并不令人意外，毕竟这一天相当繁重。整个星期都让人感到疲惫。每当她外出为了两人的生计而四处掠夺、拆散家园时，屋子里总带着一丝寒意。

Though time had still remained fluid, malleable, he could still count the tick and the tock of the now ancient house clock. It had been a foreign epoch of time, his body now taking action over dwindling away, naked in that accursed room. He had cleaned. Perhaps a reminder of all he had been beforehand, he had cooked. It was the least he could have done.  
虽然时间依旧如流水般可塑，他仍能清晰地数出那古老屋钟的滴答声。身处异域时代，他的身体不再任由消逝，而是在那被诅咒的房间里采取行动。他进行了清扫，或许是对过往的一种缅怀；他烹饪了食物，这是他此刻所能尽的最小努力。

Memoirs of the event a few nights prior drenched his brain. The feeling of her flesh laying on his very own, the outline of red light comfortably forming around her. Her face- well, if not for the hydrangea, the symmetry of her joy would have unnerved him. Instead, it only made her more beautiful. The moon's dark tides could never sully the sight of her smile. Such love in those oceans of things they called eyes- yet hatred, as well. Her voice's tone matched that juxtaposition quite well.  
几夜前事件的回忆深深印在他的脑海中。她肌肤紧贴着他，红色光晕舒适地环绕着她。她的面容——若非那绣球花，她喜悦的和谐之美或许会让他感到不安。然而，这反而让她更加迷人。月亮的暗潮永远无法玷污她笑容的美好。那些他们称之为眼睛的深邃中，既有爱意也有恨意。她的语调恰如其分地体现了这种复杂的情感对比。

"All you'll ever be…" 你永远都只会是……

Those words, unlike sunlight's expressions, did manage to perturb him. And suddenly, he felt abyssal.  
那些话语，不同于阳光的温暖表达，确实让他感到不安。突然间，他觉得自己深邃无比。

His face sunk in against the reflection, forehead from human- well, monster, apparently - to angel connected from their mirroring actions. Lower, lower, his face dropped and skinned against the glass of the shower. It was the only thing that brought warmth to him, he surmised. This place, the rancid stench of abandoned pipes smouldering the room with the dampest warmth. It was something they could never fix- despite her apparent genius, even she knew next to nothing about how to recover this apartment. Misato's legacy would die here, along with the beach-implanted cross soon to rot from soul stew. They might've died there, too. Or maybe just him.  
他的脸紧贴着镜中的倒影，从人类的额头——好吧，显然是怪物——到天使，通过他们的镜像动作相连。他的脸越来越低，紧贴着淋浴间的玻璃。他想，这是唯一能给他带来温暖的东西。这个地方，废弃管道散发出的恶臭，用最潮湿的温暖熏烤着房间。这是他们永远无法修复的——尽管她显然是个天才，甚至她对如何恢复这个公寓也几乎一无所知。Misato 的遗产将在这里消逝，连同那块即将从灵魂汤中腐烂的海滩十字架。他们可能也死在那里了，或者只是他。

His illness, the sacks of souls oozing out of his pores, had only been growing worse. Worse, and worse, and worse. He could have been more verbose in those thoughts, but that's the truth. It only got worse.  
他的病情，那些从毛孔中渗出的灵魂袋子，日益恶化。越来越严重，越来越严重。他本可以在这些想法上更啰嗦，但那是事实。情况只会变得更糟。

And, almost proving the point in his mind, he struggled against his throat, pale lips preemptively opening as to avoid the taste of iron, of blood, of people. People he would never have known. People he did. A bit of himself, and a bit of Asuka, too.  
这几乎在他心中印证了这一点，他努力抑制喉咙的不适，苍白的嘴唇提前张开，以免尝到铁锈、血液和人的气息。那些他本不会相识的人，那些他确实相识的人。这其中既有他自己的一部分，也有明日香的一部分。

Hitching his entire body, his spine particularly sore due to the convulsions, his mind could only watch as a few million souls clawed their way out of his throat, the orange substance coating them, imprisoning them, enforcing the fact they couldn't fly away. The mass slithered its way out of his throat, landing like a corpse upon the tiled floors below him. Putrid. He looked around after the fact, seeing multiple more of his deliveries spread all over the washroom.  
他全身抽搐，脊柱因痉挛而特别酸痛，只能眼睁睁看着数百万灵魂从喉咙中挣扎而出，橙色物质覆盖着它们，囚禁着它们，强化了它们无法飞离的事实。这一大团东西从他喉咙里滑出，像一具尸体一样落在下面的瓷砖地板上，散发着恶臭。事后他环顾四周，看到洗手间里散落着更多他的“成果”。

Maybe that was the stench, then. Not the pipes, but himself.  
或许那股臭味正是源自他本人，而非管道。

His nails skimmed against his face as to wash the lives away from his mouth, provenance to his brain that he had still been real, still clearly human despite the deformity exiting what he'd have once used to breathe. An oesophagus raw, heavy, barren and ancient. His nose may not have enjoyed those smells, but it was much more approachable than the skinning feeling of saliva against his throat.  
他的指甲轻抚脸庞，似乎想洗去嘴边的生命痕迹，以此向大脑证明自己依旧真实，尽管形态异变，却依然保持着清晰的人性。那粗糙、沉重、荒凉而古老的食道，他的鼻子或许不喜欢那些气味，但比起唾液在喉咙上的刺痛感，这要容易忍受得多。

It pained him to speak. But still, he did.  
说话对他来说是一种痛苦，然而他还是开口了。

Perhaps only a tiniest gag shooting his body upward, he slowly rose against the same surface he had slid down against. It was a shock the glass had managed to keep its composure this long, his hands slamming against it as his stone eyes faced ones of blood, ones of malice.  
也许只是轻微的声响，他的身体向上弹起，缓缓地升向曾滑落的同一平面。令人惊讶的是，玻璃竟能保持如此长时间的平静，他的双手重重地拍击在上面，而他的冷漠眼神与那些充满血丝、满含恶意的目光相对。

The angel had spoken first.  
天使首先发话了。

"What I told you was correct. Man is ultimately alone. Your becoming a monster was not something unforeseen. Every human will follow this path, with their fear of loneliness overthrowing their integrity. After all, how else could you have coped? You had murdered your hope. It's why I won't stop repeating this to you. Why I won't stop your metamorphosis.  
我之前说的没错。人终究是孤独的。你变成怪物并非出乎意料。每个人都会走上这条路，孤独的恐惧会让他们丧失正直。毕竟，你还能怎么应对呢？你已经扼杀了希望。这就是为什么我不会停止向你重复这一点。为什么我不会阻止你的蜕变。

"Burn it down." 烧毁它。

He could have laughed, but then again, he could have cried as well. What difference did it make anyway?  
他本可以笑出声来，但也同样可能哭出来。说到底，这又有什么区别呢？

"It's you, isn't it." 是你，没错吧。

He couldn't keep faith in this old fireplace.  
他对这旧壁炉已不再抱有信念。

"You're the reason I'm like this, Kaworu."  
“渚薰，是你让我变成了现在这样。”

Slender pillars gingerly pressed against each other, the reflection of index fingers matching as the boy pointed at his angel in the mirror. Hair of black failed to cover his vision, and as a result, the angel's red nearly drowned him.  
细长的柱子轻柔地相互倚靠，男孩在镜中指向他的天使，食指的倒影相映成趣。黑色的发丝未能遮住他的视线，使得天使的红色几乎将他吞没。

"The reason I own half a mind. The reason I'm seeing you right now. The reason my hair is getting blacker, the reason I'm vomiting fucking souls, the reason Asuka owns those bleeding petals on her face.  
我之所以只保留了一半心智，之所以此刻与你相见，之所以我的发色愈发深沉，之所以我在呕吐那些可憎的灵魂，以及明日香脸上那些淌血花瓣的缘由。

"You're the reason why this world is red."  
你就是这个世界的鲜红之源。

No response arose from those sour lips.  
那些酸涩的嘴唇未曾发出任何回应。

"You're not even real. Something that the sea has cursed me with. Me, trapped with you. Asuka, settling with…"  
你根本就不是真的。这是大海对我的诅咒。我，竟然和你困在一起。明日香，就这样……

His teacher arose in his mind. Those days in those fields of nature, where new colours, ferocious and tactile, adorned his young mind.  
他的老师在他心中浮现。那些日子在自然的田野里，新的色彩，既狂野又触手可及，装点着他年轻的头脑。

"Her garden." 她的园子。

The angel appeared discouraged by his denial. His final words only affirmed it.  
天使因他的拒绝而显得沮丧，他最后的话语更是坚定了这一事实。

"Do you still think she's beautiful?"  
你现在还觉得她很美吗？

It was time to leave.  
该走了。

Inchmeal, his body croaked itself away from the shower reflection, eyes of monster and angel still locked in some twisted matrimony. It took a lifetime to tear away, and he felt the room age a little. He almost forgot how brittle time truly was with procrastination.  
他缓缓地从淋浴的倒影中抽身，身体仿佛在嘎吱作响，怪物与天使的目光仍纠缠在某种扭曲的婚姻中。挣脱这一束缚仿佛耗尽了一生，他感到房间也随之老去了一点。他几乎忘记了时间在拖延中是多么脆弱。

A few steps toward the door, and the angel in that mirror had finally opened its mouth. Anything to keep him contained, keep them together.  
向门口迈了几步，镜中的天使终于开口了。一切都是为了让他留在原地，让他们不分离。

"You see it, don't you? The church upon your spine."  
你看到了吧？那座矗立在你脊背上的教堂。

Stone turned to meet crimson for one last time.  
斯通转过身，最后一次与深红对视。

"What?" 什么？

"It's real. She can see it too."  
这是真实的。她也能看见。

Oh. How riveting. 哦，真是引人入胜。

"Anything else? Or should I just burn you down, instead of everything else?"  
还有其他要求吗？还是我直接把你烧掉，而不是其他东西？

"I love you." 我爱你。

He could have laughed, and he could have cried. But instead, he settled on a smile.  
他本可以笑出声，也可以泪流满面。然而，他最终选择了微笑。

"Goodbye, Kaworu." 再见，薰。

And the devil's door slammed shut. His hair had stayed just as black as before.  
恶魔之门猛地关上，他的头发依旧乌黑如初。

---

"Who was that?" 那是谁啊？

The question bore some semblance of panic to it, but he never gave it any thought. Instead, he merely bit down on some poorly made semblance of frozen chicken, finally realising and absorbing the information of his location. It seemed after his reflection left his presence, he hadn't been nearly as focused for the rest of the day. She just happened to notice. With a mind much more active than his had been, it was clear she'd look for anything to comment on. Upon realising how boring and sickly his "meal" had truly been, he decided the attention she gave would have been a gratifying subversion.  
这个问题似乎带有几分慌乱，但他并未深究。他只是咬了一口劣质的冷冻鸡肉仿制品，最终意识到并接受了他的位置信息。在他反思离开后，他那天剩下的时间似乎都不够专注。她恰好注意到了。她的思维比他的活跃得多，显然她会寻找任何可以评论的东西。当他意识到自己的“餐食”是多么乏味和病态时，他觉得她给予的关注将是一种令人满意的逆转。

"What do you mean?" 你指的是什么？

"You were talking to someone, as soon as I came back in."  
我一回来，你就正在和某人交谈。

Oh, so she'd come back around that time. Strange, his ears had only been perturbed by her presence a few minutes ago.  
哦，这么说她那时回来了。真奇怪，几分钟前他的耳朵才因她的出现而感到不安。

"Kaworu." 渚。

Another bite into that sickly meal.  
再次品尝那令人不适的餐食。

Just outside his cornea, he recognised her face as it recoiled, sinking into a deep invasion of her own psyche.  
就在他的角膜外，他认出了她的脸，当它退缩时，深深地侵入了她自己的内心世界。

Soon after a ponderous silence, she asked another question.  
在一段沉重的沉默之后不久，她再次发问。

"The final angel? The one you had to kill?"  
最后的使者吗？那个你不得不杀的？

Instrumentality had been the only factor that could have given her that information.  
工具性是唯一能向她提供这些信息的因素。

He didn't really have to kill him in the slightest, in all honesty. That regicide was one that, though seemingly woven by whatever force fate had truly been, could have been avoided, and practically nothing would have changed. It had all occurred anyway. The swirling of souls, the knowledge of failure, the feeling of filtering into one. The angel's death only spared him from that putrid future.  
坦白讲，他其实根本没必要杀他。那场弑君行为，尽管看似由命运之力所编织，实际上是可以避免的，而且几乎不会改变任何事。一切还是照常发生。灵魂的旋转，对失败的认知，以及那种融入一体的感觉。天使的死只是让他逃过了那个腐朽的未来。

If it was done any earlier, the angel would have that church he seemed to own. Or, he wouldn't have cared.  
如果这件事提早完成，天使就会得到那座他似乎拥有的教堂。又或者，他对此毫不在意。

But the truth was fluid, almost as always. So, he remarked only half of it.  
然而，真相总是变幻莫测，几乎从未固定。于是，他只透露了其中的一半。

"Yeah, that's him." 对，就是他。

Her expressions relaxed upon noticing her partner's disdain, perhaps feeling regretful in case this conversation would fall to ruin by her hand. Then again, she could have run her mouth about anything, and it could have been just as burnt as a result. The sun does tend to sting, after all.  
她注意到同伴的轻蔑后，表情放松下来，或许内心感到后悔，生怕这场对话会因自己的原因而失败。此外，她可能对任何事情都毫无顾忌地畅所欲言，结果可能同样糟糕。毕竟，太阳总是会让人感到刺痛。

Another ponderous silence.  
又一次沉闷的沉默。

"Do you think you loved him?"  
你觉得自己曾经爱过他吗？

He must've preferred the silence.  
他想必更喜欢那份宁静。

"He loved me. I liked that feeling."  
他爱我，我喜欢那种感觉。

"But you didn't love him?"  
但你并不爱他吗？

A face much too revolting, a gasp escaped him as he began to grit his teeth, eyes not as indignant as his mouth. Just perturbed. Always perturbed, if only by her. Gradually, his eyes met that same fury his mouth had incurred.  
一张极其令人厌恶的面孔，他咬紧牙关，发出一声喘息，眼中怒火不及嘴角。只是略显不安。总是因她而感到不安。渐渐地，他的目光中也燃起了与嘴角同样的怒火。

"You've seen what's inside me. Take a look. What do you think?"  
你已经窥见我的内心世界。不妨再仔细看看。你有什么想法？

And with abrupt nature, her form shifted on the withered wooden chair, head now leaning against her hand, her left hand, the one unsullied from slithering hydrangea. Her eyes seemed dull, bored, yet nowhere near his figure. Perhaps, she had actually thought about it. Or she hadn't realised this conversation had been potently offensive to him.  
她突然间自然地变换姿势，坐在那张枯朽的木椅上，头倚靠在左手上，那只未被滑腻的绣球花沾染的手。她的眼神显得呆滞而无聊，却丝毫未曾留意到他的存在。也许，她真的思考过这个问题。又或许，她并未意识到这场对话对他而言是多么具有冒犯性。

"I think you loved him."  
我觉得你曾经爱过他。

Relief swelled inside of him, his eyes shimmering with vague tears as they gently closed, a sigh escaping seconds after the fact.  
他心中涌起一阵宽慰，双眼微闭，隐约闪烁着泪光，随后不久便轻轻叹息一声。

"Like a child loves a toy."  
如同孩子对玩具的喜爱。

That ounce of relief seemed to diminish, a candle in a setting far too windy. Only unbridled rage had started to swelter.  
那微小的解脱感仿佛在风中摇曳的烛火般逐渐消逝，取而代之的是无法遏制的怒火开始升腾。

His fist ricocheted off the dense oak of the table, an impartial bruise spreading with a rose tint. His eyes, which once had only seemed perturbed, now had been drawn to a dismantled look, visionaries filled with the lustre of anguish, of hell. He had been there, and she hadn't. She had no right to speak of things she couldn't understand, no right in the slightest.  
他的拳头猛击在坚硬的橡木桌上，留下一片均匀的玫瑰色淤痕。他的眼神，曾经只是略显困扰，如今却显得支离破碎，眼中闪烁着痛苦的色彩，仿佛来自地狱。他曾亲历其境，而她未曾经历。她没有资格谈论那些她无法理解的感受，一点资格都没有。

Other than the fact that she really, really did.  
除了她确实做到了这一点之外。

Instrumentality was a world of no lies, a chaotic hyperbole performed in front of one audience. Everyone. On show, for each of them to have a peek inside each other, explore each other. An anti-mitosis.  
“机关”是一个没有谎言的世界，一场在所有人面前上演的混乱夸张剧。每个人都在展示自己，让彼此窥视内心，探索对方。这是一种反有丝分裂的现象。

She was one of the first to visit it. She knew far too much before he ever had the chance to know.  
她是首批参观者之一，早在他有机会了解之前，她就已经知晓甚多。

And with that fact, his fury started to diminish almost like his relief. His lips, once plump and ready to burst with vile imaginations, now felt emaciated, parched, ruined. Barren. His eyes, once twisted and sketched with a whirlpool ink, calmed into something much more sombre, more grey.  
随着这一事实的明了，他的怒气逐渐消散，仿佛他的解脱感也随之而来。曾经饱满、充满恶念的双唇，如今显得干瘪、枯竭、破败。空无一物。他的双眼，曾经充满扭曲与漩涡般的深邃，现在变得更为沉静，色调也转为灰暗。

She stared at him with both of her blues, the globe and the ocean-flower residing comfortably to her left. Her mouth had shifted to something slightly open, almost as if a drip of shock had invaded her system. Following it, her eyes sank into the void of the table, the mouth once open portraying gritting teeth. It almost looked like she felt guilty. Maybe his mind had been a little too foreign on that part.  
她用那双蓝眼睛凝视着他，地球与海洋之花般的光彩安然居于她的左侧。她的嘴微微张开，似乎有一丝震惊悄然侵入她的心扉。紧接着，她的视线沉入桌面的深邃，原本微张的唇间显露出紧咬的牙关。她那神情，仿佛在自责。或许在那一部分，他的心思对她而言显得过于陌生。

He kept his gaze low, eyes watering as sorrow replaced his blood. Thoughts of sunlight, moonlight, a splinter-ridden bathtub along with her body, naked and gleaming. The tub had been filled with urine, with splits of bark from the decayed home above her. And there was blood, too. So much. Despite being in a mode of godhood, he still couldn't manage to recall whether it was hers or not.  
他低垂着目光，泪水在眼眶中打转，悲伤之情取代了血液的流动。脑海中浮现出阳光、月光，以及那布满裂片的浴缸，还有她赤裸而闪耀的身体。浴缸里满是尿液，夹杂着她上方腐朽房屋掉落的树皮碎片。血，如此之多。即便身处神性状态，他依然无法确定那血是否属于她。

He would have liked to inspect her body, to check for cuts, slivers across her wrists which may have been a signature to her attempted suicide in that bathtub. But he might never have gotten the chance to from their relationship at that time. It barely even was one, anyways. It only galvanised his sorrow further.  
他原本想仔细检查她的身体，寻找手腕上可能留下的割痕，这些细痕或许是她在浴缸中企图自杀的迹象。然而，从那时他们的关系来看，他可能永远没有机会这么做。毕竟，那段关系几乎名存实亡。这反而加深了他的悲痛。

"Hey." 嗨。

Startled from the separation of silence, his eyes looked up, still soft but much more visible than his previous grey.  
从寂静的分离中惊醒，他抬起双眼，依旧温柔，却比先前的灰暗更显眼。

She towered over him, intimidating only in her shadow eclipsing the primeval light. Mumbling something amalgamated, his shock only grew and spawned a yelp out of him as her waist dropped down onto his, her hands suddenly linked around the back of his neck. Her form leaned forward, giving a slight leeway where he could see the gap between her breasts. Almost like what she demanded from Kaji. But it didn't matter, his thoughts surmised, transforming from thoughts of sorrow and grief to thoughts of warmth, of a deep globe of eternal fire. He always forgot just how warm she was.  
她高耸于他之上，仅在她的影子遮蔽原始之光时显得威慑。他咕哝着一些混杂的话语，震惊之情愈发强烈，当她的腰身降落在他身上，双手突然环抱在他颈后时，他不禁发出一声惊叫。她的身形前倾，留出一点空隙，他可以看到她双峰之间的缝隙。几乎就像她对 Kaji 所要求的那样。但这些都不重要，他的思绪总结道，从悲伤和哀愁转变为温暖，想到一个深邃的永恒火焰之球。他总是忘记她是多么温暖。

How comfortable his summer would be.  
他的夏天将会过得多么惬意。

She tucked her left hand into the fur of his hair, gently pushing his face into her shoulder as she leaned on his. There, she planted a benign kiss onto his neck, onto his ear, onto his collar. He couldn't tell if it was regret or want she had felt to gain the guts to do this, but he only shooed those thoughts away as her embrace encapsulated him. It made him happy. It made him warm.  
她轻轻地将左手埋入他的发丝，温柔地引导他的脸颊贴近自己的肩头，同时依偎在他身旁。随后，她在他的颈间、耳边以及领口处落下了一个慈爱的吻。他难以判断她此举是出于悔意还是渴望，但当她的怀抱紧紧环绕着他时，他便将这些思绪抛诸脑后。这份拥抱让他感到无比的幸福与温暖。

And, warmth coinciding with the grief he had felt beforehand, it made him want to sob.  
温暖与先前的悲伤交织在一起，令他忍不住想要痛哭一场。

His own hands engaged around her waist, diligently pulling her scent in, conjoining the flesh now only separated by clothing. Slow in his tempo, as not to alarm her already trembling body. He only wanted a little more of her. More, more, and more still.  
他的双手紧紧环抱住她的腰，深深吸入她的香气，此刻两人仅隔着衣物肌肤相贴。他动作轻柔，以免惊扰她那颤抖的身体。他只渴望能再多拥有她一些。更多，更多，无尽的渴望。

His feelings swelled. Tears had started to stream before his mind could even recognise it. His body treading the footsteps of his emotions, his grasp on her only grew tighter, more desperate.  
他的情感如潮水般涌动，意识还未及反应，泪水已悄然滑落。他的身体紧随情感的步伐，对她的拥抱越发紧绷，越发显得绝望。

"We have to stop doing this."  
我们得停止这种行为。

Her kisses paused as she spoke.  
她说话间，吻便停了下来。

"Putting each other down like this, trying to get these stupid reactions. I should have just left it. I know that must have hurt."  
这样互相贬低，试图引起这些愚蠢的反应。我本该就这样离开的。我知道那一定很伤人。

His sobs never stopped her.  
他的哭泣从未让她停下。

"Stay like this. Please, please stay like this for me. Don't leave. Don't you dare leave me, monster."  
就这样保持，好吗？为了我，请一直这样。不要走开。你绝对不能离开我，怪物。

He never planned to, Asuka.  
他从未有过这样的打算，明日香。

"Hold me." 紧紧抱住我。

And there, he did. Of course he would. Anything to keep her happy, to keep the sun's sweet smile. It made him smile, too. What was life without that feeling? That solace, the one thing he learnt man needed out of their souls.  
在那里，他确实做到了。当然他会这么做。任何事情只要能让她开心，能留住阳光般甜美的笑容。这让他也笑了。没有那种感觉，生活又算什么呢？那种慰藉，是他学到的人从灵魂中需要的那一样东西。

Was it love? 那是爱情吗？

For him, probably. He couldn't get her angle on the topic, but he assumed it wasn't. Maybe he was just an escape. Something false, an activity made for the passing of time.  
对他而言，或许如此。他难以把握她对这个话题的观点，但他推测并非如此。也许他只是一种逃避方式。一种虚幻的存在，仅仅是为了消磨时光而进行的活动。

But he was fine with that.  
但他对此并不介意。

He kept on crying anyways, never lonely, never separated.  
他依然不停地哭泣，从不感到孤单，也从未被分离。

---

It probably took too long in that position. They had both started to feel warmth swell into something boiling, more uncomfortable. Thankfully, his tears had paused in their run, and his sobs had started to settle, his eyes still desperately closed against the comfort of the crook of her neck.  
或许在那位置上待得太久了。两人都感到温暖逐渐升温，变得愈发难以忍受。所幸，他的泪水已止，抽泣也渐渐平复，尽管他的双眼仍紧闭，不愿接受她颈窝的慰藉。

Too slow to be allegro, too fast to be lento, her body trembled as oceanic hydrangea separated from his nape, moving sluggishly to look at him. Her eyes seared with blue. His eyes were bulbs, puffy from the stream of tears meandering out of him. Despite the lustre above them, lighting the outline of this decrepit home, his eyes couldn't tear themselves away from hers. It was something to be lost in. Something which had a petrichor he adored the scent of. Though, as swift as the contact came, it was lost by her eyelids soft close.  
她的动作既不够快到成为快板，也不够慢到成为慢板，身体颤抖着，仿佛海洋般的绣球花从他颈后缓缓分离。她的眼中燃烧着蓝色火焰。他的眼睛肿胀如灯泡，泪水不断流出。尽管头顶的光辉照亮了这破旧房屋的轮廓，他的视线却无法从她的眼中移开。那是一种让人沉醉的境界，散发着他所钟爱的雨后泥土的芬芳。然而，这份联系转瞬即逝，随着她眼睑的轻轻闭合而中断。

She sniffled, waving her hand across her face and wiping her nose before staring at him once more, eyes brimming with a passion that he hadn't seemed to spot previously. Almost like they were back breaking down that wall of Jericho, separated only through words. It was that which drew him in. Her cryptic language, a gargantuan sun.  
她轻声啜泣，挥手拂过脸颊，拭去鼻端的泪珠，再次凝视着他，眼中闪烁着之前未曾察觉的炽热情感。仿佛他们正合力推倒耶利哥的城墙，仅凭言语维系着彼此的距离。正是这份神秘与力量，深深吸引了他。她的言辞，宛如一轮巨大的太阳，照亮了他的心扉。

He pondered on a question he had failed to call upon before this sudden union. Her two sides, her apparent dominance over them both, and his relationship between the brothers of man and monster. For some reason, her body's flames and her eye's aqua resulted in a similar conflict; what part of her had won?  
他沉思着一个之前未曾触及的问题，这个问题在这次突如其来的联合中显得尤为突出。她的双重性格，她对两者的明显掌控，以及他与人和怪物兄弟之间的复杂关系。不知为何，她身体的火焰与眼睛的碧蓝之间产生了类似的冲突；究竟是她的哪一部分占据了上风？

The fervent sunlight, or the bottomless ocean?  
是炽热的阳光，还是深不可测的海洋？

"Come with me." 跟我走吧。

Cracking out of that horrid half-mind he seemed to constantly be slipping into, his eyes focused on her motion. Her hand, the one with hydrangea not infecting it, grabbed his own with zeal lacing her intentions. As swift as her fingers visited his own, she pulled him off of his chair, the wood heaving to the ground with a tumultuous smash as panic nestled into his mouth. He yelped as they crashed through their home, the setting of the kitchen switching into something colder, yet a little warmer, luke in feeling. The bedroom, illuminated only by the constant red of the outer soul-sea. It was difficult for him to process the speed, the cross between the two locations.  
他终于从那令人厌恶的半清醒状态中挣脱出来，目光紧随着她的动作。她那只未被绣球花感染的手，满怀热情地抓住了他的手。她的手指迅速触碰他的手，随即拉他离开椅子，椅子轰然倒地，发出巨响，恐慌涌上他的心头。他们穿过家，厨房的场景变得冷酷，却又带着一丝温暖。卧室里，只有外界灵魂之海的恒定红色光线照亮。他难以理解这种速度，两个地点之间的转换。

And just as the whirlwind occurred, he released another yelp as she benignly, yet potently as well, shoved him onto the comfort of his duvet. For a moment, he stared terrified, yet also welcomed, as her face laid inches away from his, both of her hands forcefully linked with his, chain-esque. He could have sworn a blush appeared upon her. That fact caused one to appear on him, too. Though, perhaps realising the brevity and weight of their plight, she moved off of him, instead sprinting to his cabinet, an aged pine somehow holding whatever  
就在旋风席卷之际，她温和而有力地将他推倒在柔软的羽绒被上，他不禁再次发出一声惊叫。那一刻，他既惊恐又感到一丝安慰，因为她的脸庞近在咫尺，双手紧紧相扣，宛如链条。他几乎可以肯定，她的脸颊泛起了红晕。这一发现也让他自己的脸颊染上了红晕。然而，或许意识到他们所处境遇的紧迫与严重，她迅速从他身上离开，奔向他的老松木柜子，那柜子不知怎的竟能承载一切。

item she so desperately wanted to show.  
她急切想要展示的那件物品。

She ripped it apart in search of her something. No other word could similarly describe it, she ripped through it, a slayer in her ambition.  
她为了寻找某样东西，将它撕得粉碎。没有其他词能如此贴切地描述这一幕，她如同一个充满野心的杀手，毫不留情地撕裂了它。

Then, her form began to slow. Her breaths had started to settle. Her hands, once rumbling, now simplified into something more controlled. Gradually, given a few seconds after her siege, her fingers dipped into the cabinet with a nature more tender.  
随后，她的动作逐渐放缓，呼吸也趋于平稳。曾经颤抖的双手，如今变得沉稳而有序。片刻之后，她的手指轻柔地探入柜中，动作自然而细腻。

His faith in her never dimmed, despite the situation pertaining a lovecraftian dread. The fear of the unknowable. He never could have understood her intentions, what flowed in the pathways of her neurons. He never could have known what gift she would unveil: it could have been a severed skull, either Rei's or Kaworu's, a mocking of what he stood for. It could have been a lily, a signature of rebirth. Hers, his, it didn't matter. He didn't know. That's why he feared her.  
尽管身处洛夫克拉夫特式的恐惧情境，他对她的信任始终未曾动摇。他无法洞悉她的意图，也无法理解她神经网络中涌动的思绪。他无从得知她将揭示何种礼物：或许是丽或卡瓦洛的头骨，以此嘲讽他的立场；亦或是一朵百合，象征着新生。无论是她的还是他的，对他而言都无足轻重。他一无所知。这正是他畏惧她的原因。

Still, he trusted her now much more than previously. She wasn't just his fireplace anymore, she was his one source of light in this blackened, crimson planet.  
尽管如此，他对她的信任已远超从前。她不再仅仅是他的温暖港湾，而是这个被黑暗与血色吞噬的星球上，他唯一的光明之源。

Yet, as her hand revealed something strangely shaped, paper twisted at the end with a roach entering the bottom of it, cylindrified and well-rolled, confusion overtook his leering gloom.  
然而，当她手中展示出一个形状怪异的物品，纸张末端扭曲，一只蟑螂从底部钻入，圆柱状且卷得紧密，混乱的情绪取代了他阴沉的目光。

A smile dressed her face as she took a step closer to him, a newfound flame in a metal container illuminating the room with a bright, auburn flame. An absolute contrast to the rime of the room before it. It was a lighter. A real one, held in the same hand as the pencil-like, earthy scented paper she had held with such reverence.  
她面带微笑，向他迈近一步，金属容器中新点燃的火焰照亮了房间，那是一团明亮的赭色火焰，与之前的房间寒霜形成了鲜明对比。这是一只打火机，真正的打火机，与她曾如此虔诚地握着的铅笔般、散发着泥土香味的纸张在同一只手中。

"Monster, 怪兽，

His stone focused on her shifting lips.  
他的目光紧盯着她那不断变换的唇形。

"Have you ever smoked before?"  
你之前有没有抽过烟？

---

His plight had been unimaginable.  
他的处境极其艰难，难以想象。

His bed, his duvet, he gripped onto it with sound strength as his nerves had a delayed settling. It was the only thing keeping him grounded, from rising without reprisal to the heavens. That wasn't even possible, was it? Yet, he felt like it could have happened at any moment, any second he disconnected from the comfortable material he had now revered as a saviour. It was confusing, to put it in a term humanity could understand. Such a swift transformation from an instrumentalist mind to one without weight, without such gravity. What had done it? What had freed him of sordid woe?  
他的床，他的羽绒被，他用坚定的力量紧紧抓住它们，因为他的神经需要时间来安定。这是唯一让他保持现实感的东西，使他不会无缘无故地升入天堂。这显然是不可能的，对吧？然而，他感觉这随时都可能发生，只要他一离开现在视为救星的舒适材料。用人类能理解的话来说，这是令人困惑的。从一个有目的性的思维转变为一个没有重量、没有如此重力的思维，如此迅速。是什么导致了这一切？是什么让他摆脱了肮脏的忧愁？

Asuka called it something funny, her pronunciation of it mixing what he assumed to be English with a prideful German tinge. A "joint", he recalled. For some reason, the thought of the word sparked a few giggles out of him.  
明日香给它起了个有趣的名字，她的发音中混杂着他认为是英语的元素，同时带着一种自豪的德国腔调。他记得是“joint”。不知为何，这个词让他忍不住笑了起来。

He went to take another toke.  
他又去吸了一口。

And once again, just like all the times beforehand, he had choked on the abrupt infiltration of smoke, coughing almost like he was vomiting another packet of souls. And just like that faint buzz of static which seemed to flood his head each time he heaved out those pustules, each choke delivered the same strange distortion.  
又一次，如同以往的每一次，他因突如其来的烟雾而呛咳，那咳嗽声几乎像是他在吐出另一包灵魂。每当他咳出那些脓包时，那种微弱的静电般的嗡嗡声似乎每次都会充斥他的脑海，每一次窒息都带来了同样奇怪的扭曲。

Except, of course, it didn't disappear, as the sensation his vomit gave him did.  
当然，它并未消失，与他的呕吐感所给予他的感觉不同。

The fact itself sparked a few giggles to rise out of him, the edges of his lips careening outward into an ever-growing grin. Those giggles shifted into chuckles, and those chuckles into wheezes which could've brought tears out of him if they lapsed any longer. The partner next to him, a sun somehow sunnier, took notice of his outburst. In fact, she shared it in full.  
这个事实本身就让他忍不住笑出声来，嘴角逐渐上扬，笑容越发灿烂。那些笑声先是变成了轻笑，接着又变成了喘息，如果再持续久一点，可能会让他笑出眼泪。他身旁的伙伴，仿佛比阳光还要灿烂，注意到了他的这一幕。事实上，她完全沉浸在这份欢乐之中。

Her laughs were evermore vibrant, the same metamorphosis of giggle to cry forming as her back arched from the bubbling laughter nestling in her core. The sight nearly granted him reprieve from the laughter as a much grosser, dirtier feeling overcame him. But he laughed it off anyways, discarding the idea of her ruin by his hand.  
她的笑声愈发响亮，每一次笑声都像是将欢笑转化为哭泣的变形，在她因内心涌动的欢笑而弓起的背上展现。这一幕几乎让他从笑声中得到解脱，但一种更为粗俗、肮脏的感觉笼罩了他。尽管如此，他还是一笑置之，抛开了亲手毁掉她的念头。

It was so warm. All he ever wanted had somehow made its way there; a solitude box, where even the frosted blue tones of the room contained a pivotal flame. The mindly fuzz, where his half-mind state had withered, vanished, slipped. He felt so human, so in touch with the concepts of culture his mind had forgotten.  
天气异常温暖。他一直渴望的东西不知怎么就来到了这里；一个孤独的空间，连房间里霜冻的蓝色调都蕴含着关键的火焰。心灵的模糊感，他半清醒的状态已经枯萎、消失、溜走。他感觉如此人性化，与那些被他遗忘的文化概念如此亲近。

But then, he took a look next to him.  
然而，他随即向身旁瞥了一眼。

There, gripping the same duvet, aching with that familiar fuzz, mending with her own post-instrumental disease, was a creature entirely disparate to his concepts of humanity.  
在那里，紧握着同一条被单，因那种熟悉的模糊痛楚而痛苦，用她自身的后遗症在自我疗愈，这个生物与他所理解的人类截然不同。

The only proof, perhaps, that he wasn't a human at all.  
或许，这是唯一能证明他根本不是人类的证据。

"Have I ever really known you?"  
我是否真的了解过你？

The words escaped his mouth before he could dare imprison them. He hated that it even occurred as he witnessed her bulbous ocean of an eye begin to focus on him, what had once bubbled now flat, sleek, predatory.  
话不自觉地从他口中溜出，他还没来得及控制。他厌恶这一幕的发生，当她那深邃如海的眼睛开始锁定他，曾经灵动的目光如今变得平静、犀利，充满猎食者的气息。

Her lips parted. If he was sober, his heart wouldn't have lost a beat. But he was far from sober, and his heart might have missed two. God, she was beautiful. It made this whole conversation so much more difficult to handle.  
她的唇瓣微启。若他清醒，心跳或许不会漏拍。然而他醉意深沉，心跳可能已漏了两拍。天哪，她美得惊人。这使得整个对话愈发难以应付。

"What do you mean?" 你指的是什么？

She was right to ask that. He didn't know what he had meant either; he barely had a basis to start with. Still, the words flowed out of him as though he had planned it all anyway.  
她问得对。其实他也不清楚自己想表达什么，几乎毫无头绪。但那些话却自然而然地脱口而出，仿佛一切早已在他心中酝酿。

"I've seen you. Whatever the idea of "you" really is. You know, wherever we went when I.."  
我曾见过你，无论“你”这个概念究竟意味着什么。你知道，无论我去过哪里，当……

When he ended everything.  
当他把一切都结束时。

"I'd never seen you like that. You were… so brittle. So different from what I knew of you beforehand."  
我从未见过你这般模样。你显得……如此脆弱。与我之前认识的你大相径庭。

She flopped her head sinistrally, instead staring up at the canvas of a ceiling they had shared. His words never paused.  
她将头偏向左边，目光转向了他们共同拥有的那幅天花板画布。他的话语始终没有中断。

"That's not my Asuka. You're strong, you're flexible, you're someone separate to the ideals of others. You're the sun itself: an indignant globe of infinite power, burned into everyone's eyes no matter how far you are."  
那不是我的明日香。你强大而灵活，独立于他人的理想之外。你就是太阳本身：一个充满无限力量的愤怒球体，无论距离多远，都会灼伤每个人的眼睛。

He almost commented on that other part of her. The ocean, as deep and as broad as could be. He hoped vehemently that her sunlight could overpower that ocean, to evaporate it completely through sheer will.  
他差点就对她的另一面发表了看法。那片海洋，深不可测，广袤无垠。他强烈希望她的阳光能够战胜这片海洋，仅凭意志力将其完全蒸发。

Her lips twisted into a smirk:  
她的嘴角微微上扬，露出一抹讥讽的笑意：

"Well, I guess the truth is rather fluid, isn't it?"  
“嗯，我想真相是相当多变的，不是吗？”

Her answer made him doubt sunlight's victory.  
她的回答让他开始怀疑阳光是否能取得胜利。

Silence overtook them soon after, an infinite blanket smothering each and every move they made. Every breath seemed to catch an echo in their solitude, barely separated from each other in tempo. His eyes flickered past the ceiling, nearer to her character. Her eyes did the same. Though, unlike his own, hers never abandoned his form. Almost uncomfortable, though the fact also made his heart swell.  
不久后，寂静如无边的毯子般笼罩了他们，窒息了每一个动作。每一次呼吸似乎都在孤独中回响，节奏上几乎彼此分离。他的目光掠过天花板，更接近她的性格。她的眼睛也做了同样的事情。然而，与他的不同，她的目光始终未曾离开他的身影。尽管有些不自在，但这个事实也让他的心感到温暖。

That swell still solid and well-formed in his mind, he recalled other encounters in which he felt the same pang. When she first called him a monster. When she even just said "no".  
那个在他心中依旧坚实且完好的浪潮，勾起了他其他那些同样令他感到刺痛的回忆。无论是她第一次称他为怪物，还是她仅仅说出“不”的那一刻。

When she was laying in that tub, radiant with blood.  
她躺在浴缸中，鲜血淋漓，却光彩夺目。

"Was it your blood?" 那是你的血吗？

He forgot, her eye still had been focused solely on him.  
他未曾察觉，她的视线始终只锁定在他一人身上。

"You've got to stop being this fucking vague."  
你得停止这么含糊其辞。

Flushed from the exclamative, he made a swift attempt at clarification.  
从感叹中回过神来，他迅速尝试澄清。

"In that bathtub, I mean. Where you went after that angel, where none of us truly knew. There was blood in it. A lot."  
“在那浴缸里，我是说。你离开那个天使之后去的地方，我们谁也不真正了解。浴缸里有很多血。”

Her face hastily grew bitter, turning away from him. He imagined the grit of her teeth, her fist tightly locked with the bedroom linen and nearly tearing it clean off. And it made sense, of course. No one had the right to witness that part of her. That endless abyss even her destructive mind forced herself to forget. Maybe it was better if he didn't say anything at all, maybe that would've been easier, maybe-  
她的面容迅速转为苦涩，转身背对他。他想象她咬紧牙关，拳头紧握床单，几乎要将其撕裂。这当然合情合理。没有人有权见证她那一部分，那连她自己毁灭性的心灵也强迫遗忘的无尽深渊。或许，他保持沉默才是更好的选择，那样或许会更简单，或许——

"It was mine." 那原本是我的。

His heart dropped. 他心里一沉。

Lower, lower, lower, lower and lower still.  
越来越低，越来越低，甚至更低。

"Why?" 为何如此？

She still didn't turn to face his devastation.  
她依旧没有转过身来面对他的绝望。

"Oh, come on, you're decent at science. Haven't you heard of equilibrium?"  
“哎呀，别这样，你在科学方面挺不错的。难道没听说过平衡状态吗？”

His nerves still hadn't settled to the sudden confession. Brusque words had only barely managed exit, the shock he felt now an abrupt lifeline he had to rely on for communication. His heart ached. Hers must have, too.  
他的神经依旧未能从这突如其来的告白中安定下来。那些生硬的话语勉强得以表达，而此刻他所感受到的震惊，成了他不得不依赖的沟通纽带。他的心在隐隐作痛，她的心想必也是如此。

"Physics or chemistry?" 是物理还是化学？

She scoffed. 她不屑一顾。

"Physics." 物理学。

The state in which opposing forces or influences are balanced.  
对立力量或影响达到平衡的状态。

For a moment, her face leaned over her shoulder, catching a glimpse at his face. He was horrid at interpreting his own expressions, though he assumed it must have been something confused, muddled, conflicted. From the look of her own face, her body flipping to finally give him reprieve from the loss of her contact, facing him closer now than ever before, he must've been right in his assumption.  
有那么一刻，她侧过头，从肩膀上瞥了一眼他的脸。他很难解读自己的表情，但他猜那一定是某种混乱、困惑、矛盾的混合体。从她脸上的神情和她转身面向他，比以往任何时候都更近的举动来看，他的猜测应该是正确的。

"Sometimes," 有时，

Her voice brought clarity.  
她的声音使一切变得清晰明了。

"If one issue is too big, too massive, too powerful for me to confront and fix, I just… Make another one. Like, when I was a kid, I broke one of my Dad's dinner plates. He was so fucking angry, I thought I was about to be flayed alive. For the rest of the day, even after he had moved on and had used another one of the thousands of ugly plates he bought, I'd still feel that pressure. That disappointment. Just a toddler, doing toddler things, right? No, I couldn't handle the shame."  
如果一个问题过于庞大、难以解决，我会选择制造一个新的问题来逃避。记得小时候，我不小心打破了爸爸的一个餐盘，他当时愤怒至极，我甚至以为自己会受到严厉的惩罚。尽管后来他使用了其他盘子，但那天剩下的时间里，我始终感受到那种沉重的压力和深深的失望。毕竟，那时的我只是个孩子，做了孩子常做的事，但我无法承受随之而来的羞耻感。

"Then what did you do?"  
那你后来做了什么呢？

She appeared as if she was about to jump out of her skin. Perhaps she forgot he was even listening.  
她显得异常激动，仿佛要跳出自己的皮肤。或许她根本没意识到他还在听。

"My house was under refurbishment. While no one was looking, I went to one of those slabs of wood they use for god knows what, you know, one with all the nails in and all that goofy construction shit attached to it."  
我的房子那时正在翻修。趁着没人留意，我走到一块他们不知作何用途的木板旁，那种钉满钉子，还附带各种杂七杂八建筑材料的木板。

A smile had been plastered over those tender lips. Not one that connoted anything well-mannered- no, it was a rather grim one. One that didn't belong to a plight like this.  
一抹僵硬的微笑凝固在那柔嫩的唇边。这并非那种温文尔雅的微笑——不，它显得相当阴郁。这样的微笑并不适合这样的困境。

"So, I grabbed one of those nails,"  
于是，我拿起了一根钉子，

His heart slacked a little more than two beats.  
他的心跳比平时慢了两拍多。

"Lifted it as high as I possibly could-"  
“我尽可能高地举起了它——”

And what? Threw it straight into a construction worker's eye?  
那又怎样？难道直接扔进建筑工人的眼睛里吗？

"And struck my palm with as much strength as I could have possibly given."  
“并以我全力击打我的手掌。”

She tucked her arm in her chest, her memories seemingly sweet and tidy, warm, a reminder of good times and emotionally-wealthy possibilities.  
她将手臂紧抱胸前，那些记忆仿佛甜美又井然有序，温暖如春，让人想起那些美好时光和情感充盈的可能性。

He just tried not to cry.  
他只是努力忍住不哭。

She took notice of his disturbed look, her eyes rolling and smile dissipating as her hand gently caressed his cheek, a motion completely juxtaposing what her face emitted.  
她察觉到他脸上的不安，眼神流转，笑容渐隐，而她的手却轻柔地抚摸着他的脸颊，这一举动与她面部的表情形成了鲜明对比。

"Monster, please, it isn't that bad."  
怪物，拜托，情况没那么糟。

"You could've died, Asuka."  
你差点就没命了，明日香。

"From a nail? I had already gotten my tetanus shot, there's about a one in five hundred million chance I would've died."  
被钉子扎到？我早就接种了破伤风疫苗，死亡的概率大约只有五亿分之一。

"I'm talking about the fucking bath."  
我说的是那个该死的浴缸。

His wrath gave her pause, eyes and mouth both parted to lengthy proportions. She might've expected something else to follow that, but instead, his eyes just latched onto hers, his stone seemingly cracking under the weight of her words. And under the destroyed ruins, it almost looked like his eyes reflected the moon above them, shining through the window like all the days before. No, it was more like they embraced it. Devoured it. Became it.  
他的怒火让她顿感震惊，双眼和嘴巴都张得大大的。她本以为会有别的反应，然而，他的目光却紧紧锁定了她的，仿佛他的心墙在她的言辞重压下裂开了缝隙。在那片破碎的废墟之下，他的眼睛似乎映照着他们头顶的月亮，月光透过窗户洒进来，如同往常的每一个夜晚。不，更像是他的眼神在拥抱那月光，吞噬那月光，最终与月光融为一体。

Her arms wrapped around his neck, pulling him in deeper to her cavernous intoxication. If she didn't know how easily he lost to lust beforehand, she certainly did now. And following that quota, all signs of disdain had been annihilated from his system.  
她双臂环抱着他的脖颈，将他拉入更深的迷醉之中。若非亲眼所见，她绝不会相信他如此轻易就被欲望征服。此刻，他身上那些不屑一顾的神情已荡然无存。

Her whispers were sharp: 她的低语显得尖锐：

"And yet, look at me now."  
然而，看看我现在的样子。

He couldn't do anything but that.  
他除了那件事别无选择。

"I'm good as new." 我恢复得像新的一样。

Another silence dawned over them, foreheads touching, moonlight and sunlight eyes still mangled together, omnisciently predicting each other's thoughts, moves, breaths, emotions, lust. He wanted to move closer. In his head, he imagined she might've too, her yearning eyes razing his soul with eldritch prowess. The sun against the moon, perhaps not so much of a checkmate as he would've thought. Their board wasn't just black and white after all, was it? No, it was a meandering blue, a frivolous red, a revolting green, a mystique purple.  
又是一阵沉默笼罩在他们之间，额头相触，月光与阳光般的眼睛依旧交织在一起，仿佛无所不知地预知着彼此的思想、动作、呼吸、情感和欲望。他渴望靠得更近。在他的想象中，她或许也有同样的渴望，她那充满渴望的眼神以一种诡异的力量深深触动着他的灵魂。太阳与月亮之间的较量，或许并不像他原本以为的那样是决定性的胜利。毕竟，他们的棋盘不仅仅是黑与白，而是蜿蜒的蓝色、轻浮的红色、令人厌恶的绿色和神秘的紫色。

An endless, vibrant eclipse.  
一场无边无际、充满活力的日食。

"...And that's why you're a monster."  
...这就是你被称为怪物的原因。

A whisper even quieter than the ones previous to this eclipse.  
比此次日食前所有耳语都更为轻柔的细语。

"You're a hound. I'm not some duvet you can rely on when you start feeling ill, in fact, I don't even believe anyone really was. We're just slabs of meat for you to feast on, to feel comfortable within."  
你就像个猎犬。我可不是你生病时能依赖的羽绒被，说实话，我甚至怀疑是否真有人能做到。我们对你来说，不过是供你享用、让你感到安逸的肉块罢了。

He was just about too exhausted to even attempt a response. Her body only shifted slightly further up the bed, enough to the point where his head could lean against her chest.  
他已疲惫至极，几乎无力回应。她只是稍稍向上挪动了一些，恰到好处地让他的头能够倚靠在她的胸口。

"You've swallowed up the moon and you don't even realise it. In fact, you've built a wall of stone in your eyes to try and hide it, deflect it, keep it contained."  
你吞噬了月亮却未曾察觉，其实你用石墙在眼中筑起，试图隐藏、转移并困住它。

He felt slumber grip his soul with strength beyond reason.  
他感到一股无法抗拒的睡意，以超越理智的力量紧紧攫住了他的灵魂。

"But a wolf in sheep's clothing still needs his fix. Eventually, that wall will break. Eventually, there'll be nothing stopping you from eating me alive. I'll be so far down inside you, no one would ever be able to tell where I ended and you began. And no one will. It'll just be you, with a full belly."  
然而，伪装成羊的狼终究无法抑制内心的渴望。总有一天，那道屏障会崩溃。总有一天，没有任何事物能阻挡你将我彻底吞噬。我将深深融入你的体内，以至于无人能分辨我与你的界限。这一切将悄无声息地发生，只剩下你，腹中充实。

Whenever did she start sounding so much like Kaworu?  
她是从何时起变得如此像渚薰那样说话的？

That angel. That decapitated force of perversion, impurity, a false salvation. The Gabriel of humanity's conscience.  
那个天使，象征着被斩首的堕落力量，充满不洁与虚假的救赎。他是人类良知中的加百列。

Had he been the source of this? The garden slaughtering her body, the vomit escaping his throat?  
这一切的源头是否是他？花园吞噬着她的身体，而他喉咙中涌出呕吐物？

The reason why her words made so much sense?  
她的话为何如此有道理呢？

"You're right." 你说得没错。

Sparking a jump out of his partner, femininity now fresh in both their minds as he slowly climbed up her form, once again appreciating each naked pore she granted him, his moonlight eyes overwhelming her ocean, as well as her mind of sun.  
他激发了跳出伙伴圈子的冲动，此刻两人心中都充满了新鲜的女性气息。他缓缓攀上她的身躯，再次欣赏她赋予他的每一寸裸露肌肤，他的月光般的眼眸淹没了她的海洋，也淹没了她的心灵。

"I am a monster. I take and leave nothing, and I attempt to run away from that fact. I'm despicable. I destroyed you, and when there was a chance you could've been at peace, I ripped you right back into my life."  
我是个怪物，掠夺一切却不留痕迹，我试图逃避这一事实。我卑鄙无耻，毁了你，而当你本有机会获得安宁时，我却再次将你拖回我的生活。

Her eyes creased away from his, each attempting to escape into left corners, right corners, anywhere where her embarrassment from his lack of distance couldn't be found. But eventually, his hands had gently directed her chin towards him, affirming that she needed to listen to everything he possibly had to say. A confession. A question, perhaps?  
她的目光从他身上移开，试图躲进左角、右角，任何能避开他过于亲近带来的尴尬的地方。然而，他的双手轻柔地将她的下巴转向自己，表明她必须聆听他可能要说的每一句话。这或许是一次告白，又或许是一个问题？

"But," 但是，

Her attention had been called into question.  
她的专注力遭到了质疑。

"I don't want to stay like this."  
我不想继续这样下去。

Why did she look so shocked?  
她为何显得如此震惊？

In a reversal of biblical proportions, his hand danced as delicately as it could to her cheek. Her face settling into a confused, embarrassed look of both desire and frustration, her eye locked on with the hand on her cheek, then back at the giver of this affection. Upon their shared contact, the sun and the moon, her face almost pouted, almost whined, almost begged for more.  
他的手轻柔地抚上她的脸颊，仿佛圣经中的场景倒转。她的面容交织着渴望与困惑，显得有些尴尬，目光紧随着那抚摸她脸颊的手，随后又转向这份温情的施予者。在他们肌肤相触的瞬间，仿佛日月同辉，她的表情中带着一丝撒娇，一丝不满，又似乎在无声地乞求更多。

"Asuka." 明日香。

Upon hearing her own name, her ideals shattered. The only thing remaining was her yearning eye, and the sea-flowers beside it.  
当她听到自己的名字时，心中的理想瞬间崩塌。唯一留存的，是她那充满渴望的眼神，以及身旁的海花。

"Don't make me your monster."  
别让我成为你的怪物。

She felt his breath tickle her nose.  
她感觉到他的呼吸轻柔地撩拨着她的鼻尖。

"Make me your martyr." 让我成为你的牺牲品。

Her lust paused at that, he collected. But then, that pout of hers moulded into a grin. One knowing of their future, accepting of his metamorphosis.  
她的欲望在那儿停下了，他如是想。然而，她那撅起的嘴角随即化作一抹微笑，仿佛已预见他们的未来，并欣然接受了他的蜕变。

"Then kiss me, martyr." “那就吻我吧，我的殉道者。”

Nothing stopped him from doing so.  
没有任何事物能阻止他这么做。

And he recalled, their lips connected in brief, warm, lustful parity-  
他回忆起，他们的双唇曾短暂而温暖地相触，充满了欲望的平等——

Though it wasn't their first kiss, it certainly felt like one.  
尽管这不是他们的初次接吻，但那一刻的感觉确实如同初吻般强烈。

---

Her body had been cradled by his own, his hands desperately wrapped around her waist, a faux-adult replication of a cuddle. Anything to give her warmth, vitality, the knowledge that her weakness was something he adored. Anything to make the sun as bright in the sky as could possibly be.  
她的身体被他紧紧拥抱着，他的双手紧紧环绕在她的腰间，仿佛是在模仿成人式的拥抱。他这样做是为了给她温暖和活力，让她明白她的脆弱正是他所珍爱的。他希望这样做能让天空中的太阳尽可能地明亮。

Anything to keep her ocean shallow.  
一切皆为使她的海洋保持浅浅。

Barely a ways away from falling to the cumbersome slumber she had submitted herself to, he twisted his head sinistral, visiting the window holding their ruined kingdom out of frame.  
她几乎就要沉入那沉重而笨拙的睡眠，他扭头向左，目光投向窗外，那里是他们破败王国的边缘，未被纳入视野。

And in that darkness, of course, came a reflection off the glass.  
在那个黑暗的环境中，自然地，玻璃上反射出了光芒。

And in that reflection, of course, was his fallen angel.  
当然，在那倒影之中，映现着他堕落的天使。

"You still haven't answered me."  
你还没有回复我。

Of course he hadn't. How could he? He had cut you off.  
他当然没有，怎么可能呢？毕竟他已经和你断绝了往来。

"Answered what?" 回答了什么呢？

His voice was a croak, a whisper as to not wake her from whatever dreamscape she had been subjected to.  
他的声音沙哑而低沉，仿佛在轻声细语，生怕打扰到她所沉溺的梦境世界。

"Do you still think she's beautiful?"  
你现在还觉得她很美吗？

He peered over the form leaning over him. The scars of her garden, the trodden mess of her hair. The purity of her flesh, her face, her smile, her paper lips he had so horribly wanted to press against his own.  
他俯视着压在他身上的表格，看到了她花园的伤痕和她被践踏的乱发。她的肉体纯洁无瑕，她的脸庞、微笑，以及那纸一般的嘴唇，他曾如此强烈地渴望亲吻。

The answer was obvious. 答案显而易见。

"I don't know what I'd be if I didn't, Kaworu."  
“如果没有你，我也不知道自己会变成什么样，渚薰。”

"Then why won't she say your name?"  
“那她为何不肯说出你的名字呢？”

Ah, now he remembered. That night. The red skyline, the promise of fire and ruin fresh in his mind. 'Burn it all', that same angel had demanded. What a stupid, poignantly disgusting order.  
啊，他终于回想起来了。那个夜晚，红色的天际线映入眼帘，毁灭与灾难的预感在他心中依旧鲜明。“烧毁一切”，那个天使曾如此命令。这命令愚蠢至极，却又令人心痛地厌恶。

"I don't know. I don't care. She's here, in my arms, as lovely as she always has been."  
我不清楚，也不在意。她就在我怀中，依旧那么迷人。

He threw a glare at his reflection once more.  
他又一次向镜中的自己投去严厉的目光。

"The ocean to put out your flames."  
海洋将熄灭你的热情。

His angel pondered on that. The thought of his elemental counter, as well as his proxy's usage of his lover's inner torment. Of course, the martyr knew all the angel thought. It was his own reflection, after all.  
他的天使对此陷入沉思。他不仅考虑了自己的基本对策，还有他的代理如何利用他爱人的内心痛苦。当然，殉道者对天使的想法了如指掌，毕竟，那正是他自己的内心反映。

And soon after the words were spoken, it seemed sleep had been an offer too prosperous to let up.  
话音刚落，睡眠似乎就成了一个过于诱人的提议，让人难以抗拒。

"You'll come back to me. You always do."  
你会回到我身边的，你总是如此。

Maybe. But for now, he was warm. And that's all he ever needed.  
也许如此。但眼下，他感到温暖，这已是他所需的一切。

"You'll burn it all." 你会把它们全部烧毁的。

AN：哈哈，抱歉，只剩两章了_

### Comment
[OutOfAsushin](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/15136376/OutOfAsushin): DB doesn't tell a lie, your prose really are astounding. It serves to make an entirely new experience to most fics, and its perfectly suited to the trauma, confusion, and misery of post a third-impact world. Whereas most works use imagery as an aside to the plot, the imagery her is the plot, if that makes any sense at all. You do a fantastic job of entrapping the reader into an interconnected web of thoughts, feelings, and memories, which all serves to illustrate what must be running through Shinji's head at every moment. Overall, this felt fresh while also drawing on the simultaneous dread and hope of End of Evangelion I remember. Can't wait for more king!
所以没错，这真的很棒，有可能成为一部大作。DB没有说谎，你的文笔确实令人惊叹。它为大多数同人文带来了全新的体验，完美契合了第三次冲击后世界的创伤、混乱和痛苦。在多数作品中，意象只是情节的陪衬，而在这里，意象本身就是情节，如果这说得通的话。你出色地将读者困在一个由思想、情感和记忆交织而成的网络中，这一切都旨在描绘真嗣每一刻脑海中可能闪现的念头。总的来说，这种感觉既新鲜又唤起了我对《新世纪福音战士》结局的既恐惧又充满希望的记忆。期待更多精彩内容！

[B4asileus](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/13459304/B4asileus): Jesus Christ that is some beautiful writing.  
It manages to make the story feel like some sort of ancient divine nightmare.  
I loved the continued remark about how everything was red, really simple sentences that add just so much to the overall atmosphere, and man the use of the word monster just hits home, since in the Italian dub the last thing shinji says in presence of asuka before third impact is “I am a monster”, which replaces the “I’m so fucked up” or “I’m the lowest of the low” in English.  
So yeah, this is really good and could possibly become a real big hitter
天哪，这真是绝美的文字。它让整个故事仿佛变成了某种古老的神圣噩梦。我特别喜欢文中反复提到的“一切都是红色的”，这些简单却极富感染力的句子为整体氛围增色不少。还有，“怪物”这个词用得恰到好处，因为在意大利语配音中，真嗣在第三次冲击前对明日香说的最后一句话是“我是个怪物”，这取代了英文中的“我真是糟糕透顶”或“我低贱至极”。

[SheriffJohnStone](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/14891111/SheriffJohnStone): That was crazy. The way you describe things is compelling as all hell. A particular highlight was how you wrote Shinji’s recollection of EoE. Can’t wait for more!  
那真是太疯狂了。你描述事物的方式非常引人入胜。特别值得一提的是你如何描写真嗣对《EoE》的回忆。期待更多！

[deathbringer374](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1166503/deathbringer374): I'm really loving this story. What strikes me the most is your ability to weave these sentences together, these paragraphs, this incredible prose that keeps me engaged and draws me in. The emotion, the thought, the chaos, the longing and the anger, all so palpable.  
我真的很喜欢这个故事。最让我印象深刻的是你将这些句子、这些段落编织在一起的能力，这种令人难以置信的散文让我始终保持投入并深深吸引。情感、思考、混乱、渴望和愤怒，都如此真实。  
  
As a post TI fic, I have so say I'm absolutely hooked and when it reaches it's climax, which I hope will bring about a delicious resolution for our dearest Asuka and Shinji, this story will go to my favorites. Your talent to display these feelings with nothing but the necessary words is refreshing, and a progression is felt in the events, even when it's not overly expressed. Just masterful. It's like a poem within a story, within the mind of Shinji Ikari. Chef's kiss.  
作为一部后 TI 小说，我不得不说我完全被吸引了，当它达到高潮时，我希望会为我们亲爱的明日香和真嗣带来一个美妙的结局，这个故事将进入我的最爱。你用必要的文字展现这些情感的天赋令人耳目一新，即使没有过度表达，事件的进展也能感受到。简直是大师级的。就像一首诗，一个故事，在碇真嗣的内心中。完美至极。  
  
PEACE.

[deathbringer374](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1166503/deathbringer374): "The crown of literature is poetry."  
文学的桂冠是诗歌。  
  
This chapter had a lot of traction, lots of movement to it, without missing for once second this amazingly poetic feeling to it. As always, the writing is but superb, and we as readers are plunged into the monster's tortured mind, into the man's pleas. What an update. Bravo.  
这一章节充满了动力，充满了动感，丝毫没有错过这种令人惊叹的诗意感觉。一如既往，文笔卓越，我们作为读者被深深地带入了怪物痛苦的心灵，进入了那人的恳求之中。多么精彩的更新。太棒了。  
  
Asuka's actions are baffling, as always. Something told me a dark turn would be taken, a test would be made perhaps. The last lines, the last action of this chapter... it leaves me with questions, and many emotions in my chest.  
明日香的行为一如既往地令人费解。某种感觉告诉我，会有一个黑暗的转折，或许是一次考验。这一章的最后几行，最后的行动……它让我心中充满了疑问和许多情感。  
  
This story will make you feel. And in what wondrous, unique way it will. Amazing update! I'm eager for more! Come, my dear monster! Do not slip completely! Thank you for the update! Remember to stay healthy and eat your veggies!  
这个故事会让你感受到。而且是以多么奇妙、独特的方式。精彩的更新！我急切地期待更多！来吧，我亲爱的怪物！不要完全溜走！感谢更新！记得保持健康，多吃蔬菜！  
  
PEACE.

[daikahieu](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/15264844/daikahieu): As a foreigner, my google chrome tabs are as stacked as a deck of cards after rereading the oatmeal fic in its entirety, just so many new terms and imageries that I doubt I even came close to having a full understanding of the text yet. Regardless, I am still mesmerized by your prose and the emotional beats weaved into the lines still hit me hard. Man is this dark, this is leading to a codependent and destructive relationship at this rate, but I'd be waiting for the later chapters to pass judgement. We've only been seeing Shinji's decaying mind, hopefully the story will deal with Asuka's struggles later on.  
作为一个外国人，我的谷歌浏览器标签页就像一副重新阅读完的燕麦片同人文后堆叠的扑克牌一样，实在有太多新术语和意象，我怀疑自己是否真的接近完全理解了文本。尽管如此，我仍然被你的文笔所吸引，那些融入字里行间的情感节奏依然深深打动着我。天哪，这故事真黑暗，照这样发展下去，似乎要走向一段相互依赖且具有破坏性的关系，但我会在后续章节再做评判。目前我们只看到了真嗣逐渐崩溃的内心，希望故事后续能处理明日香的挣扎。  
So in short: Oatmeal fic good, it makes me feel things but I don't understand it, keep it up man love your work.  
简而言之：燕麦片同人文很棒，它让我感受到了情感波动，但我并不完全理解，继续加油，兄弟，我喜欢你的作品。

[DeadUser1](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/15081590/DeadUser1): Your way of writing and description is amazing, however it's not my thing. When I began reading I felt confused and, sorry for saying this, bored. I am not the type of person which likes reading poetry, especially poetry style and I am not accustomed to song style either. Still, your third chapter really was more coherent, in a style I understand, and I was able to appreciate it. Nevertheless, I wont continue because its not my thing but that doesn't mean you are a bad writer or a good story teller. Keep up the good work cause I am amazed at how you do it.  
你的写作和描述方式令人惊叹，但这并不适合我。当我开始阅读时，我感到困惑，并且很抱歉这么说，还有些无聊。我不是那种喜欢阅读诗歌的人，尤其是诗歌风格，我也不习惯歌曲风格。不过，你的第三章确实更加连贯，风格我也理解，我能够欣赏它。尽管如此，我不会继续阅读，因为它不是我的菜，但这并不意味着你是一个糟糕的作家或是一个好的讲故事的人。继续努力，因为你的表现让我感到惊讶。

[Glory-To-Our-August-King](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4279126/Glory-To-Our-August-King): There's an Eva fanfic writer by the name of Mustachioed Cat. Personally I've always been a big fan, except when he gets ultra meta. It's fine in small doses, because his stories are about intertwining realities and bending perceptions.  
有一位名叫 Mustachioed Cat 的 Eva 同人小说作者。我个人一直是他的忠实粉丝，除了他过于超现实的时候。少量出现还行，因为他的故事涉及交织的现实和感知扭曲。  
  
But then he would do too much of it. Entire chapters worth. So much that there basically wasn't a story, at least not one that could be coherently followed.  
但他会做得太过火。整章整章地写。多到故事基本不存在，至少不是一个能连贯跟进的。  
  
This story reminds me a lot of that.  
这个故事让我想起了那个。  
  
Although it is also much shorter than anything he's ever written, which is appreciated.  
尽管它也比他以往写的任何东西都短得多，这点很受欢迎。  
  
The problem I have is the narrative is so intentionally vague - or "super meta poetry writing shit" as you described it -that I have no investment in what is actually happening. Primarily because I don't know what is supposed to be happening. I can inspect each sentence and get a hint, like poetry, but that's tedious to do in an actual story and just drags me down to disinterest.  
我遇到的问题是叙述过于刻意模糊——或者如你所说的“超级元诗歌写作”——以至于我对实际发生的事情毫无投入感。主要是因为我不知道应该发生什么。我可以逐句分析，像解读诗歌一样获得一些线索，但在实际故事中这样做很乏味，只会让我感到厌烦。  
  
Which is a shame, since there are very brief moments of clarity where the narrative is actually up front with me and I'm able to build a mental picture. It doesn't happen much until the latter half of chapter 3, and I really liked that. Shinji had thoughts that weren't god-speak jibberish and Asuka and the world around them were vividly rendered.  
这很遗憾，因为确实有非常短暂的清晰时刻，叙述直接明了，我能构建出清晰的画面。这种情况直到第三章后半部分才多起来，我真的很喜欢那样。真嗣有了不是神谕胡言乱语的想法，明日香和他们周围的世界都生动地呈现出来。  
  
I hope you continue that trend.  
我希望你能继续保持这种趋势。  
  
If this story had 90% less meta poetry talk, I would probably really enjoy it.  
如果这个故事的元诗歌讨论减少 90%，我可能会非常喜欢它。  
  
If it had also decided to just be a piece of poetry, I would probably have really enjoyed that too.  
如果它决定只成为一首诗，我大概也会非常喜欢。  
  
Some other thoughts: 其他想法：  
  
I like how the world is described as a garden, Shinji being king in his garden with nothing in it, except Asuka. I also really like how she is viewed through him in the story's less trying descriptions, like in chapter 3.  
我喜欢这个世界被描述成一个花园，真嗣在他的花园里，里面空无一物，除了明日香。我也非常喜欢她在故事中不那么费力的描述中被他看待的方式，比如在第三章。  
  
Starting at the beach was a big downer. Everyone does that. Big oof, but what kind of saved it was the thing I like least about this story - the poetry prose. It felt like he was having some wack fever dream in the aftermath of Third Impact, which was kind of cool, then it continued and way overstayed its welcome.  
从海滩开始真是个大败笔。大家都这么做。真是大失所望，但救场的是我最不喜欢的故事部分——诗意散文。感觉就像他在第三次冲击后的余波中做了一场怪异的狂热梦，这有点酷，然后它继续发展，却过度滞留，让人厌烦。  
  
I'm not sure where this is supposed to be going, but I would not mind reading future chapters. If only because of how small and bite-sized they are.  
我不确定这故事要往哪儿发展，但我倒不介意读未来的章节。仅仅因为它们短小精悍，易于消化。  
  
Good luck, lil nigga.  
祝你好运，小兄弟。

[daikahieu](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/15264844/daikahieu): I think this is a good chapter overall, the most noticeable thing in this chapter being the change in the narration style. While I've learned to appreciate your narration style in the previous chapters, this clearer and more straightforward style is definitely a welcoming change as it allows for the story's events to be easier to follow. I also think it's a better fit for an interaction-driven chapter such as this one where the pacing is more conventional than the previous more contemplative chapters.  
我认为这一章(第四章)整体上很不错，最显著的变化是叙事风格的转变。虽然我已逐渐习惯了您在前几章中的叙事风格，但这种更清晰直接的风格无疑更受欢迎，因为它使得故事情节更易于理解。我也认为这种风格更适合像本章这样以互动为主的章节，其节奏比之前更为沉思的章节更为传统。  
  
Now for the actual events of the chapter (spoiler alert), there was a lot to like here. One thing I love about this fic is how you set up the dynamic for the Asuka - Shinji relationship post EoE. The desire they have for each other is intense, yet bitter, they revel in each others warmth and affection, yet are utterly insecure about their place in the other's heart. You showed this beautifully on Shinji's side in chapter 3 and this dynamic is explored further from both sides in this chapter, which I think is proving to be the strongest parts of this fic. The dynamic is usually explored and progresses through moments of comfort and desire between Shinji and Asuka following long periods of contemplation/mental torment from Shinji, and these moments are immaculately written in my opinion. They are filled with vigour, brittleness, insecurites and longing, each moment more intense than the last, and I think it showcases perfectly how they would try to adapt to everything they've experienced, everything they've learned and their knowledge of each other's feelings. Maybe it's just the Asushinner in me speaking but I love these interactions between them and I really hope to see more of the same in future chapters.  
现在来谈谈本章的实际内容（剧透警告），这里有很多值得喜欢的地方。我特别喜欢这篇同人文的一点是，你如何为 EoE 之后的明日香与真嗣的关系设定动态。他们对彼此的渴望既强烈又苦涩，他们沉醉于对方的温暖与关爱，却又对自己的心意在对方心中所占的位置感到极度不安。你在第三章中精彩地展现了真嗣这一面的情感，而这种动态在本章中从双方进一步展开探索，我认为这正成为这篇同人文中最有力的部分。这种动态通常通过真嗣和明日香在长时间的沉思/精神折磨后寻求安慰与欲望的时刻来展现和推进，在我看来，这些时刻被刻画得极为精致。它们充满了活力、脆弱、不安与渴望，每一个瞬间都比上一个更加强烈，我认为这完美地展示了他们如何试图适应所经历的一切、所学到的一切以及对彼此感情的了解。 或许这只是我内心对 Asushin 的偏爱在作祟，但我真的很喜欢他们之间的这些互动，我非常希望在未来的章节中能看到更多这样的情节。  
  
Lastly, I think there's only one thing that I can say I didn't like in this chapter. While I think it would be very in character for Shinji to offer to be better for Asuka post EoE (the damage that his inaction can cause on his loved ones is a lesson Shinji has definitely learned, and with everything he's learned about possibly the only person that matters to him then, he would definitely do something to be a better person for Asuka), having him saying "make me your martyr" does seem a bit weird to me. Shinji's never been the one to use fancy words, and while your prose has its charm in narration, having Shinji utter those words did take me out of the story a bit. Shinji seemed like someone else in that part for that matter. While it is nice and in character for Shinji to take the initiative for once, he has never been good at communication and would be much more awkward and verbose than that. In short, while I like what you try to do with Shinji there, the way he acted just seem so unlike Shinji to me. Another small nitpick is Asuka's line "the truth is rather fluid" which seems a bit vague and looked like it tried to be meta by alluding to an earlier Shinji's train of thought, and did irk me a bit when I read it. Also I hope Shinji-ghost Kaworu won't be the main conflict in the coming chapters, I love the Asuka-Shinji conflicts here and hope it won't fall to the wayside, as this chapter has their relationship moving quite fast compared to previous ones. I'm eager to see what you're gonna do with the "church upon your spine" thing though, looking forward to the next update from you. Peace.  
最后，我认为这一章中唯一让我不太满意的地方是，虽然我认为在 EoE 之后，Shinji 为了 Asuka 而努力变得更好是非常符合他性格的（他肯定已经从自己的不作为给所爱之人带来的伤害中吸取了教训，而且既然他已经了解到可能唯一对他重要的人，他肯定会为了 Asuka 而努力成为一个更好的人），但当他提出“让我成为你的殉道者”时，这对我来说确实有些奇怪。Shinji 从未使用过华丽的辞藻，尽管你的叙述有其独特的魅力，但 Shinji 说出那些话确实让我有些出戏。在那部分情节中，Shinji 看起来就像是另一个人。虽然 Shinji 能主动采取行动是件好事，也符合他的性格，但他一直不擅长沟通，应该会更加笨拙和啰嗦。简而言之，虽然我喜欢你在那部分对 Shinji 的尝试，但他的行为在我看来实在不太像 Shinji。 另一个小挑剔是 Asuka 的台词“真相颇为流动”，这似乎有点模糊，看起来试图通过暗示 Shinji 早先的思绪来变得元，当我读到它时确实让我有点不爽。另外，我希望 Shinji-幽灵 Kaworu 不会成为接下来章节的主要冲突，我喜欢这里的 Asuka-Shinji 冲突，希望它不会被忽视，因为这一章他们的关系比之前的章节发展得快得多。我急切地想知道你会如何处理“背上的教堂”这一情节，期待你的下一更新。和平。
