Chapter 1: Asuka Arrives  

Disclaimer: Don't own Evangelion, just love it, especially Misato and Asuka.  
声明：本人并不拥有《新世纪福音战士》，只是深爱着它，尤其是对美里和明日香情有独钟。

Author's Note: First eva fic I've tried to write, and it's probably very confusing. I haven't really set a time period for this, but I guess I'm assuming End of Eva never occurred? There aren't too many spoilers in this first chapter, but I'm sure there will be more later.  
作者注：这是我尝试撰写的第一篇《新世纪福音战士》同人作品，可能相当令人困惑。我并未明确设定时间背景，但似乎默认了《终章》未曾发生？本章节中没有太多剧透，但后续章节肯定会有更多。

_I don't remember. 我不记得了。_

"She's young. I'm guessing around twenty-five, twenty-six."  
"她很年轻。我猜大概二十五、二十六岁。"

A pause. A slight pressure on her head.  
停顿了一下。她的头感到一丝轻微的压力。

"Look at the color of that hair. She must have been a great beauty at some point."  
"看那头发的颜色。她一定曾经是个大美人。"

A cold breeze. Unfamiliar voices.  
一阵寒风。陌生的声音。

"Do we know her name?"  
“我们认识她吗？”

Her name. The three words she used to flaunt so flirtingly all the time.  
她的名字。那三个她曾一直轻佻地挂在嘴边的字。

"No."

She was nameless. A nonentity wandering this earth.  
她无名无姓，不过是这世间游荡的一介无名之辈。

A sigh. "We'll wait for her to wake up. Perhaps then she'll be able to tell us more about herself."  
一声叹息。“我们等她醒来吧。或许那时她能告诉我们更多关于她自己的事。”

"Yes, that would be for the best."  
“是的，那样最好不过。”

A closing door followed by another cold draft. She could feel her hair blowing softly across her face, but she couldn't move her fingers. She cannot open her eyes to see where she is.  
一扇门关闭后，又是一阵寒风。她能感觉到自己的头发轻轻拂过脸颊，但她的手指却动弹不得。她无法睁开眼睛看看自己身处何地。

Who am I? 我是谁？

= = = = = = =

There was a soft beep as the monitor lines turned green and the clear plastic covering slid off of the patient as if by magic. The girl lying inside slowly opened her eyes.  
随着监视器上的线条转为绿色，覆盖在病人身上的透明塑料罩仿佛被魔法移开，躺在里面的女孩缓缓睁开了眼睛。

A blank patternless ceiling.  
一片空白的无图案天花板。

"Oh, you're awake!" The well-meaning nurse hurried over to her side. "How are you feeling?"  
“哦，你醒了！”好心的护士急忙走到她身边。“你感觉怎么样？”

She tried to speak. No words came from her lips, only a ragged rasp of a sound.  
她试图说话。嘴唇间没有话语流出，只有一声沙哑的喘息。

The nurse looked concerned. "Do you want some water?"  
护士看起来很担心。“你想喝点水吗？”

She nodded faintly. The nurse smiled, patted her hand, and hurried away.  
她微微点头。护士微笑着，轻拍她的手，匆匆离开了。

Who am I? 我是谁？

The question came back to haunt her as she searched the depths of her mind for answers. Surprisingly, the girl who had always told herself that there was no need for others, that she could thrive alone, vaguely remembered the names of others—but not her own.  
这个问题再次困扰着她，她在内心深处寻找答案。令人惊讶的是，那个总是告诉自己不需要别人，可以独自茁壮成长的女孩，隐约记得其他人的名字——却记不起自己的。

Misato. Major Katsuragi Misato. A young woman with strikingly dark purple hair.  
碇。葛城美里少校。一位拥有深紫色头发的年轻女性。

Ritsuko. The blonde. She could no longer remember her surname, except that it began with an A sound.  
律子。那个金发女子。她已经记不清她的姓氏了，只记得是以 A 音开头的。

Rei? The silent one. The one whose name meant "zero". The one she had hated so much, although now she couldn't remember why.  
绫波？那个沉默寡言的人。那个名字意味着“零”的人。那个她曾经如此憎恨的人，尽管现在她已经记不清原因了。

Shinji. 真嗣。

One word was synonymous with that name in her mind. Baka.  
在她心中，那个名字与一个词同义。笨蛋。

She closed her eyes and scrunched them up, racking her brains. Why could she remember all these names, or fragments of names, but not her own? There were three distinct words—that she knew—but nothing else.  
她闭上眼睛，皱紧眉头，绞尽脑汁。为什么她能记得所有这些名字，或是名字的片段，却唯独记不起自己的？她知道有三个清晰的字——但除此之外，一无所知。

She propped herself up on her elbows and looked around, inspecting all the technologically advanced machines, then came back to her own body. Her feet were grimy and the soles were rough. She wiggled her toes. Her long copper hair, once long and shiny, was now dull and felt like a weight on her shoulders.  
她用手肘撑起身子，环顾四周，仔细打量着那些高科技机器，随后目光回到自己的身体上。她的双脚满是污垢，脚底粗糙。她动了动脚趾。曾经长而亮泽的铜色长发，如今变得暗淡无光，沉重地压在肩上。

There was something hard under her, digging into her flesh. She reached under and pulled it out.  
她身下有什么硬物，硌得她生疼。她伸手探进去，将其拽了出来。

A plastic card, splattered with large red X's that covered the face and name of a teenage girl.  
一张塑料卡片，上面布满了大大的红色叉号，遮盖住了一个少女的脸庞和名字。

Who is she? 她是谁？

The door slid open abruptly and the nurse stepped back in, efficiently holding up a tall glass of water and closing the door with her foot. "Here you go."  
门突然滑开，护士退后一步，麻利地举起一大杯水，用脚关上门。'给你。'

The girl hesitated, then lifted it slowly to her lips. The cool liquid was like honey nectar to her dry, rasping throat. She drank her fill, then wiped at her lips with her free hand.  
女孩犹豫了一下，然后缓缓将它举至唇边。那清凉的液体对她干涩刺痛的喉咙来说，犹如甘露。她畅饮一番后，用空着的手擦了擦嘴唇。

The nurse pulled up a chair and sat down beside her. "Would you like to tell me your name?"  
护士拉过一把椅子，坐在她旁边。“你想告诉我你的名字吗？”

She shook her head. She could not be sure of her voice yet. The nurse averted her gaze, clearly disappointed, and it landed on the card in her pale white hands.  
她摇了摇头，还不能确定自己的声音是否稳定。护士显然失望地移开了目光，转而注视着她苍白双手中的卡片。

"It's a picture of you."  
"这是一张你的照片。"

She tried hard to comprehend the words. A picture of her? This was what she looked like?  
她努力去理解这些话。一张她的照片？这就是她的样子吗？

No, this girl was alive. She felt very dead and hollow inside.  
不，这个女孩是活生生的。而她自己感觉非常死寂和空洞。

"May I see it?" "我可以看看吗？"

Her fingers tightened on the card. Nevertheless, without much effort the nurse freed it from her hands and squinted as she rotated it back and forth, inspecting every aspect.  
她的手指紧紧捏着卡片。然而，护士没费多大力气就从她手中抽出卡片，眯起眼睛，来回转动着仔细检查每一个细节。

"Nerv, UN...Sorhyu Asuka Langley. 0001-257-33."  
"NERV, 联合国...惣流·明日香·兰格雷。0001-257-33。"

Sorhyu Asuka Langley. 惣流·明日香·兰格雷。

That's my name. 那是我的名字。

= = = = = = =

Several days passed before Asuka could speak again, and she did so then only in utter privacy. Her voice was quiet and weak at first, as she repeated the names of the objects around her, afraid to unlock the secrets of her mind and heart. She knew that if she revealed her vocal secret to the nurse, they would be interrogating her endlessly about her past. After all, she had no idea how she had turned up here and had only an ID card with a past picture of her and a few memories of some fragmented names.  
几天过去，明日香才再次开口，且仅在绝对私密的环境中。起初，她的声音微弱而低沉，重复着周围物品的名字，害怕揭开心灵深处的秘密。她明白，一旦向护士透露自己能说话的秘密，他们定会无休止地追问她的过去。毕竟，她对自己如何来到这里一无所知，身边仅有一张带有过去照片的身份证和几个零碎名字的记忆片段。

Ever since she had regained consciousness, the nurse had taken a great liking to her and gone to extremes to make her happy. In one way Asuka was happy for her company, but in another way, her incessant chatting had quickly become old. She'd learned plenty about the woman's daughters, sisters, brothers, aunts, and other relatives. She had heard so much about her house that she could probably draw a detailed diagram of it, providing she could control her mind and fingers.  
自从她恢复意识以来，那位护士就对她产生了极大的好感，并极尽所能地让她开心。一方面，明日香很高兴有她陪伴，但另一方面，她那没完没了的聊天很快就让人感到厌烦。她已经了解了很多关于这位女士的女儿、姐妹、兄弟、姑姨以及其他亲戚的事情。她听了太多关于她家的事情，以至于如果她能控制自己的思维和手指，她可能都能画出一张详细的家宅图。

She was fine physically. Asuka knew that. It was her mind that she was concerned about.  
她身体无恙，明日香对此心知肚明。她所担忧的，是她的心智。

She was alone in her room now, the fifth morning since she had awakened from her coma. The names of the machines and furniture around her had quickly become old, and slowly, bit by bit, she began to tear at the cement wall she had constructed around the people of her past.  
此刻，她独自一人在房间里，这是她从昏迷中醒来后的第五个早晨。周围机器和家具的名字很快就变得熟悉，慢慢地，一点一点地，她开始撕扯着她为过去的人们所筑起的水泥墙。

The one she remembered the most was the one she'd dubbed "baka" without really knowing why. What he had done in the past to make her call him that, she didn't know. Gradually, however, she was beginning to remember how he looked. He had been a tall, skinny boy with a long neck and distinctly feminine eyes. His hair had been dark brown and had often stuck at odd angles. In her mind he always wore the same expression—a shy, terrified look.  
她记得最清楚的是那个她无端称之为“笨蛋”的人。他过去做了什么让她这样称呼他，她并不清楚。然而，渐渐地，她开始记起他的模样。他曾是一个高瘦的男孩，脖子修长，眼睛明显带有女性的柔美。他的头发是深棕色的，常常以奇怪的角度翘起。在她的记忆中，他总是带着一种羞涩而惊恐的表情。

Asuka was sleeping regular hours now, and he was appearing in her dreams, as well. With the exception of the lack of dialogue, her dreams might have constituted the past. Shinji-baka was always standing in a vaguely kitchen, his head hanging low. Asuka wanted to yell at him, to reprimand him although she didn't know what he'd done, but she couldn't speak. She had no voice.  
如今，明日香已能规律作息，而他也会出现在她的梦中。除了缺少对话，这些梦境或许就是过往的再现。那个笨蛋真嗣总是站在一个模糊的厨房里，头低垂着。明日香想要对他大喊，尽管不知道他犯了什么错，却想要斥责他，但她发不出声音，失去了言语的能力。

But before she could find out who he, Misato Katsuragi, Ritsuko, or the mysterious Rei was, she'd have to find out who she herself was.  
但在她弄清楚他是谁，以及葛城美里、律子或神秘的绫波丽是谁之前，她首先得弄清楚自己是谁。

The problem was that all she had was an ID card of a person she didn't recognize anymore.  
问题在于，她手中仅有的身份证件属于一个她已无法辨认的人。
