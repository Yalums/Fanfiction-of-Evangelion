### Prologue: Prelude

Generalmajor Margaret Klinge was widely respected as a dedicated, disciplined, and demanding woman to work for. This in many ways made her the perfect woman to lead Germany's Bundesnachrichtendienst, its foreign intelligence agency. The BND had evolved considerably since Second Impact, transforming more and more into a branch of the military than a predominantly civilian service. That transformation was not without its critics, but due to General Klinge's demonstrated competence the only arguments they could bring to bear were theoretical ones about the necessity of civilian control over the military. In the chaos of the post-Second Impact world, those arguments were less convincing than they might have been in a more peaceful time. And it was hard to argue with results seeing as the BND under Klinge detected and then thwarted numerous threats to the Fatherland and its allies as the world slowly recovered. Little wonder then that she was often referred to as the 'Iron Lady,' sometimes affectionately and sometimes in exasperation. For if there was one absolute truth about Klinge, it was that her will was indomitable and more than one politician or bureaucrat had made the mistake of underestimating her determination or overestimating their own relative importance.  
克林格少将玛格丽特·克林格因其敬业、严谨且要求严格而广受尊敬。这在许多方面使她成为领导德国联邦情报局（Bundesnachrichtendienst，简称 BND）的理想人选。自第二次冲击以来，BND 发生了显著变化，越来越像军事分支而非主要为平民服务机构。这一转变虽不乏批评者，但由于克林格将军展现出的卓越能力，他们能提出的唯一论点是关于平民对军队控制的必要性。在第二次冲击后的混乱世界中，这些论点不如在和平时期那样有说服力。考虑到克林格领导下的 BND 成功侦测并阻止了多起对祖国及其盟友的威胁，随着世界缓慢复苏，很难对这样的成果提出异议。难怪她常被称为'铁娘子'，有时是亲切的，有时则是无奈的。 因为关于克林格，有一个绝对的事实：她的意志坚不可摧，不止一位政客或官僚曾错误地低估了她的决心，或是高估了自己相对的重要性。

For all that though, Klinge did have another nickname, one that few ever dared to say to her face. The cause of this nickname was no great mystery, though it was a source of some wonder amongst her subordinates and associates. For General Klinge was not only competent and controlled, she also likely consumed each day enough alcohol to kill a normal human. And while 'Liver of Steel' was not quite as endearing as her other nickname, it was in many ways even truer. How the general remained completely sober was another mystery to her staff for never had they seen so much as a shaking hand or a single slurred word in her crisp and precise German. But being Germans as they were, having a boss that could outdrink every single one of them combined was certainly nothing to be ashamed of. Especially when, despite her high expectations, General Klinge gave as much as she demanded. While she had never married, the men and women that made up the BND were more than willing to think of themselves as much as her sons and daughters as that of their biological parents.  
尽管如此，克林格将军还有另一个绰号，鲜有人敢当面提及。这个绰号的由来并非什么深奥之谜，却令她的下属和同事们颇为惊叹。因为克林格将军不仅能力出众、冷静自持，她每日所饮的酒精量足以令常人丧命。虽然“钢铁肝脏”这一称号不如她其他昵称那般亲切，但在许多方面却更为贴切。将军如何始终保持清醒，对她的团队而言是另一个谜团，因为他们从未见过她手颤或吐字不清，她的德语总是那么清晰准确。作为德国人，拥有一位能喝倒他们全体的领导，绝非什么丢脸之事。尤其当克林格将军虽要求严苛，却同样慷慨给予时。尽管她未曾婚嫁，那些组成德国联邦情报局的男女们，都乐于视她如己出，甚至胜过亲生父母。

Of these surrogate children, there were a select few that could get away with a modicum of affectionate disrespect for their commanding officer. Two such individuals were seated before her now in one of the 'black' offices the BND maintained for conversations that not only had to be kept off the record but completely and utterly nonexistent as far as the rest of the world was concerned. Hence why officially Klinge was in a meeting with her department heads, the younger woman present was officially working through a logistics snafu for materials destined for NERV-Tokyo, and the man here officially on his way to a practice with the Berliner Philharmoniker. Of the three technically the man was on the tightest timeline as there was no way to hide his absence from members of the public if he failed to show for the rehearsal, but no one here had much time to waste.  
在这些代理子女中，有少数几个能对他们的指挥官表现出些许亲昵的不敬而安然无恙。此刻，就有这样两个人坐在她面前，身处 BND 为那些不仅需要保密，而且必须完全不存在的对话而维护的‘黑色’办公室之一。因此，官方上克林格正在与她的部门负责人开会，年轻女子则正式处理着运往 NERV-东京的物资物流问题，而这里的男子则正式前往与柏林爱乐乐团排练。三人中，男子的时间最为紧迫，因为如果他缺席排练，公众成员无法掩饰他的缺席，但这里的每个人都没有太多时间可以浪费。

"The contract with NERV-Tokyo's gone through," the younger woman said. "Both contracts, actually. I'll be heading to Tokyo-3 next week and Soren'll follow the following week."  
“与 NERV-东京的合同已经签订，”年轻女子说道，“实际上是两份合同。我下周将前往东京-3，索伦则在下下周跟进。”

Klinge nodded and regarded the man referred to as Soren. It was his real name, or 'real' in the sense that all of his documentation stated it to be and had done so since his life began. Just as that of the other woman and Klinge's own.  
克林格点点头，打量着被称为索伦的男人。这是他的真名，或者说是‘真’名，因为所有文件上都这么写着，自他生命伊始便如此。正如另一位女士和克林格自己的名字一样。

"Here's hoping the Tokyo Philharmonic still exists after next week," Klinge said. "A shame we couldn't get you over there sooner."  
“希望东京爱乐乐团下周还能存在，”克林格说，“可惜没能早点把你送过去。”

Soren tilted his head, about as much of a physical reaction as he was likely to ever give. "The timing is unfortunate, but Amanda should be able to handle the situation. Assuming NERV does not suspect anything, we should be able to proceed."  
索伦微微侧头，这大概是他能给出的最明显的身体反应了。“时机确实不巧，但阿曼达应该能处理好局面。只要 NERV 没有起疑，我们应该能顺利进行。”

"Good," Klinge nodded. "Movement of the rest of our assets are also on schedule so you should get some more support quickly. With any luck we can start reducing casualties from the get-go."  
"好，" Klinge 点头道，"其余资产的调动也在按计划进行，你应该很快会得到更多支援。如果一切顺利，我们一开始就能减少伤亡。"

Amanda frowned, not of disagreement but of concern. "I'll do what I can, but we both know our projected rate of success is 10% under expected conditions."  
Amanda 皱起眉头，并非出于异议，而是担忧。"我会尽力而为，但我们都很清楚，在预期条件下，我们的成功率预计会低 10%。"

"If I am in position, the projection is upwards of 70%," Soren said flatly. "While we have no room for slippage, so long as the Angels remain on schedule we should be fine."  
"如果我到位，预测成功率将超过 70%，"Soren 平静地说，"虽然我们没有犯错的余地，但只要天使们按计划行动，我们应该没问题。"

Klinge sighed and sank into her chair. "There've been enough permutations already that we can't be entirely sure of anything. If we're lucky, our disruptions have been minimal enough to not affect the original timetable. Once we start intervening directly however, all bets are off."  
克林格叹了口气，陷进椅子里。“已经出现了太多变数，我们无法完全确定任何事情。如果幸运的话，我们的干扰足够轻微，不会影响原定的时间表。但一旦我们开始直接干预，一切就都说不准了。”

"That's kind of the point," Amanda stated. "The only way to effect change is to disrupt the original scenario. Beyond our immediate actions however we cannot guarantee any specific consequences."  
“这正是关键所在，”阿曼达说道，“要实现改变，就必须打破原有情景。然而，除了我们的直接行动之外，我们无法保证任何特定的后果。”

"The intended effects are achievable," Soren said again in a matter-of-fact tone. "By the time we are done, I expect quite a few people will be, displeased, with us."  
“预期的效果是可以实现的，”索伦再次用一种实事求是的语气说道，“等我们完成之后，我预计会有不少人对我们感到不满。”

Amanda and Klinge both snorted at the understatement.  
阿曼达和克林格都对这轻描淡写的说法嗤之以鼻。

"Well, I suppose at this point all I can do is have a little faith," Klinge said. She stood, picking up her glass of scotch. "Amanda, Soren."  
“好吧，我想在这个节骨眼上，我能做的就是稍微有点信心了，”克林格说道。她站起身，拿起那杯苏格兰威士忌。“阿曼达，索伦。”

The other two did likewise and raised their glasses in response.  
另外两人也照做了，举起酒杯回应。

"To a new dawn. And see you on the other side."  
“迎接新的黎明。在那一边再见。”

The three drank to that toast and set down their glasses. The younger pair made their leave first and Klinge watched them go, smiling slightly as Amanda looped her arm with Soren's. That was a sight she would never grow tired of. Maybe this time around, it would start happening much, much earlier.  
三人为此干杯，随后放下酒杯。年轻的一对先行告辞，克林格目送他们离去，微微一笑，看着阿曼达挽着索伦的手臂。这样的景象她永远不会厌倦。或许这一次，这一切会早得多地开始。

Lieutenant-Colonel Midori Kayabuki was in a foul mood. Bad enough that the JSSDF forces were being thrown fruitlessly at the approaching monstrosity, the generals were obviously too pigheaded and stubborn to know when to quit. They had expended probably the entire year's defense budget lobbing missiles, bombs, and shells at the thing and nothing had so much as fazed it. Her own unit had been able to keep out of the thing's way, if only because not even the brass was stupid enough to think that a single mechanized infantry battalion could make a difference when their opponent had basically laughed off the efforts of an entire armored division and its air support elements.  
中校圆城寺翠心情糟糕透顶。日本自卫队正徒劳无功地对抗着逼近的怪物，将军们显然过于顽固，不知进退。他们可能已经耗尽了全年国防预算，向那东西发射导弹、炸弹和炮弹，却连一丝影响都没有。她的部队能够避开那东西，仅仅是因为高层还不至于愚蠢到认为一个机械化步兵营能在对手几乎无视整个装甲师及其空中支援的情况下有所作为。

"Colonel, the target's made landfall," Lieutenant Kudo reported.  
"上校，目标已登陆，" 工藤中尉报告道。

Kayabuki nodded, not that she really needed to be told. Looking through her binoculars, she was greeted with quite the lightshow as the military continued to pound away.  
Kayabuki 点了点头，其实她并不需要被告知。透过望远镜，她看到的是一场壮观的灯光秀，军队仍在持续猛攻。

"Any new orders, ma'am?" "有新的命令吗，女士？"

"No," Kayabuki said. "We'll remain here."  
"不，" 茅吹说道。"我们将留在这里。"

"But ma'am, if we don't-"  
"但是女士，如果我们不——"

"If we don't what? Or did you see something besides us wasting a couple billion yens' worth of ordnance?"  
"如果我们不怎样？还是你除了看到我们浪费了几十亿日元的弹药之外，还看到了什么？"

"Uh, well ma'am…" "呃，女士……"

"If our orders change we'll try to carry them out," Kayabuki said. "But until then we'll hold position and not try to play hero and get a lot of people killed for nothing. We're soldiers, Kudo, not undisciplined kids."  
"如果我们的命令有变，我们会尽力执行，" 早吹说。"但在那之前，我们会坚守阵地，不会试图逞英雄而让许多人白白送命。我们是军人，工藤，不是无纪律的孩子。"

"Y-yes ma'am." "是，女士。"

"Besides," Kayabuki said as she looked back into her binoculars. "I'm pretty sure dealing with this particular monster's way above our paygrades."  
"再说了，" 茅木说，目光从望远镜上移开。"我敢肯定，对付这个特定的怪物，远超我们的职责范围。"

Kayabuki was just in time to see the VTOLs flittering around the Angel suddenly disperse. She reacted instinctively.  
茅木刚好看到垂直起降机在使徒周围飞舞，突然散开。她本能地做出了反应。

"Button down! Prepare for detonation!"  
"全员注意！准备引爆！"

---

"It shows up now, of all the times," Misato complained. "Geez…"  
"偏偏这个时候出现，" 美里抱怨道。"真是的……"

"I wonder if it's karma," the woman seated next to her in the car said.  
"我在想这是不是报应，" 坐在她车里的女人说。"

"Oh hush you," Misato said. "Remember you're the one that wanted to ride shotgun here."  
"好了，别说了，" 美里说。"记得是你自己要坐副驾驶的。"

Amanda chuckled and looked out the window. The area they were driving through had yet to be reclaimed and so ruined buildings were a dime a dozen. Still the road was paved at least, though how long that would remain the case was an open question if the increasingly deafening scream of engines was any indication. Then the explosions let loose and the car began to shake.  
阿曼达轻声笑了出来，望向窗外。他们行驶的这片区域尚未被重建，因此废弃的建筑随处可见。尽管道路至少还是铺过的，但随着引擎声愈发震耳欲聋，这条路还能维持多久就不得而知了。接着爆炸声响起，车子开始摇晃。

"Not good!" Misato cried out and gunned the engine. "Damn it, where is he!?"  
“不妙！”美里大喊一声，猛踩油门。“该死，他在哪儿！？”

Amanda was searching as frantically, praying that they had not diverged already. And then she caught sight of a lone figure on the streets, frozen in fear at the chaos erupting around him.  
阿曼达同样焦急地搜寻着，祈祷他们尚未走散。随后她瞥见街道上有一个孤独的身影，因四周爆发的混乱而惊恐地呆立着。

"There!" she shouted even as Misato spun the car around, having caught the same sight.  
"看那儿！" 她大喊道，与此同时美里也注意到了同样的景象，猛地掉转车头。

The Alpine A310 was a sports car and its performance lived up to that label. It almost flew across the asphalt and skid to a stop with a sharp turn right before the boy. Amanda threw open the door.  
阿尔派 A310 是一款跑车，其性能名副其实。它几乎是在柏油路上飞驰，一个急转弯后猛然停在了男孩面前。阿曼达迅速推开车门。

"Get in!" the brunette shouted.  
"快上车！" 棕发女子大声喊道。

The boy pulled himself up but seemed to hesitate with the lack of an open seat. Scowling, Amanda grabbed hold of him and hauled the boy into his lap before slamming the door shut.  
男孩挣扎着起身，却因没有空座位而犹豫不决。阿曼达皱着眉头，一把抓住他，将男孩拽到自己腿上，随即砰地一声关上了门。

"Go!" “走！”

Misato wasted no time gunning the engine, making their escape with all due haste. The boy seemed a bit dazed but as he began to realize just why the current padding he rested on was so 'soft' his face flushed a bright scarlet.  
美里毫不犹豫地踩下油门，迅速逃离现场。男孩似乎有些茫然，但当他意识到自己所倚靠的“软垫”为何物时，脸颊顿时涨得通红。

"I-I'm sorry!" "对-对不起！"

"Oh calm down," Amanda not quite snapped. "What is it with you Japanese and your rigid politeness? If you hadn't noticed, we've got more important things to worry about!"  
"哦，冷静点，" 阿曼达几乎是在咆哮。"你们日本人怎么总是这么拘谨的礼貌？你没注意到吗，我们有更重要的事情要担心！"

"S-sorry." "对-对不起。"

Amanda rubbed her temples in abject frustration and despite herself Misato could not help but laugh. Sure they were running for their lives from a giant monster, but the disparate reactions to stress of her passengers was just too much. People were if nothing else quite diverse.  
阿曼达揉着太阳穴，显得极度沮丧，而米莎托自己也不禁笑出声来。没错，他们正被一只巨型怪兽追得四处逃窜，但乘客们对压力的不同反应实在太过滑稽。人嘛，无论如何都是相当多样化的。

"Ah don't worry about it, Ikari Shinji-kun," Misato said. "You'll get used to her."  
“别担心，碇真嗣君，”米莎托说道，“你会习惯她的。”

They were now some distance from the fighting, the Angel having made another leap to momentarily shake the irritants nipping at it with their puny guns. Apparently deciding they were clear for the moment, Misato began slowing down.  
他们现在已经远离了战斗区域，使徒又跳跃了一次，暂时甩开了那些用微不足道枪械骚扰它的烦人小虫。看来暂时安全了，米莎托开始减速。

"Keep going!" Amanda suddenly shouted.  
"继续前进！" 阿曼达突然喊道。

"What?" "什么？"

"Don't stop! Get us behind that ridge now!"  
"别停下！快带我们到那山脊后面去！"

Not sure what her friend was going on about but trusting her instincts, Misato spun the car behind the hill before braking hard. The moment the car stopped Amanda pushed all of them down. The next, a massive boom ripped through the air and the car was buffeted by a fierce shockwave. Even with their eyes closed, an unbearable light flooded their sight. For what seemed an eternity, it was hard to know if they were even still alive as the light and sound overwhelmed their senses.  
不确定她的朋友在说什么，但相信自己的直觉，美里在山丘后急转车辆并猛踩刹车。车子刚停稳，阿曼达就迅速将他们全部按倒。紧接着，一声巨响撕裂空气，车辆被一股猛烈的冲击波击中。即便闭上眼睛，那无法忍受的强光仍充斥着他们的视野。在似乎无尽的时间里，他们难以确定自己是否还活着，因为光和声完全淹没了他们的感官。

---

"Well that sucked." Amanda was the first to speak. "We all still alive?"  
“那真是糟糕透顶。”阿曼达第一个开口，“我们都还活着吗？”

"I think so," Misato said. "What about you, Shinji-kun?"  
“我想是的，”美里说，“你呢，真嗣君？”

"Umm, yes. Thank you, Katsuragi-san, and umm, miss."  
"嗯，是的。谢谢你，葛城小姐，还有，呃，这位女士。"

Misato chuckled as she leaned against the steering wheel. "No need to be so formal, Misato is just fine. And the lady you're sharing body heat with there is Amanda Sommer."  
美里轻笑一声，靠在方向盘上。"不用这么拘谨，叫我美里就好。而你身边这位共享体温的女士是阿曼达·萨默。"

Shinji's face flushed red once more but before he could apologize Amanda cut in.  
真嗣的脸再次涨红，但还没等他道歉，阿曼达就打断了他。

"Yes, yes, you know all about sharing body heat with the opposite gender Misato," Amanda retorted. "Mr. Ikari, if you wouldn't mind, could you get in the back? Or at least get up and let me move there."  
“是啊，是啊，你最懂和异性分享体温了，美里，”阿曼达反驳道，“碇同学，如果你不介意的话，能坐到后面去吗？或者至少站起来让我挪过去。”

"Oh! Yes, of course." “哦！好的，当然可以。”

Shinji moved with all due haste and let out a sigh of relief once he had a seat of his own. Misato chuckled even while giving Amanda a look to let her friend know she would be getting her back for the remark. And then a thought seemed to occur to her.  
真嗣迅速挪动位置，一坐定便松了口气。美里一边轻笑，一边向阿曼达投去一个眼神，暗示她会为刚才的话找机会回敬。随后，她似乎想到了什么。

"Say, how'd you know about the explosion?" Misato asked his friend.  
"我说，你怎么知道爆炸的事？"美里问她的朋友。

Amanda snorted. "When your own side decides to get the hell out of an area, it's a pretty safe bet they're about to drop a really big bomb there."  
阿曼达哼了一声。"当你的自己人决定从某个区域撤离时，基本上可以肯定他们要在那里投下一颗巨型炸弹了。"

Apparently satisfied, Misato nodded. "Alright, let's get to HQ. That N2 warhead might have bought us some time, but let's not push our luck."  
美里似乎满意了，点了点头。"好吧，我们去总部。那个 N2 鱼雷或许为我们争取了一些时间，但别太冒险了。"

With that Misato fired up the car once more and got them on their way. Amanda glanced at the now very misaligned side view mirror and caught sight of Shinji in the reflection. The boy looked unsure of himself, sneaking glances at the two women in front of him. He was obviously feeling out of his depth much as his father intended. Amanda grimaced. Well, if she had anything to say about it the backbone she knew Shinji had would be making itself more known soon enough.  
随着这一动作，美里再次启动了汽车，载着他们上路。阿曼达瞥了一眼那已经严重错位的车侧镜，从反射中看到了真嗣。男孩显得有些局促不安，偷偷打量着坐在他前面的两位女性。显然，他感到自己力不从心，正如他父亲所期望的那样。阿曼达皱了皱眉。好吧，如果她能有所作为，她知道真嗣拥有的那份坚韧很快就会更加显露出来。

---

Soren walked through the hallway, easily avoiding the few police out doing their duty trying to make sure everyone was evacuated. Night had fallen and the Angel was once more advancing into the city. If things were still on schedule, Unit 01 would be deploying within the next few minutes and Shinji Ikari would make his disastrous debut as an EVA pilot. That debut would be life changing for quite a few people, not least the two people still in this apartment complex. Even now he could hear the distinct sniffling of someone trying to hold back tears. Stopping before the door, Soren knocked.  
索伦穿过走廊，轻松避开了那些正在执行任务、确保所有人疏散的少数警察。夜幕已经降临，使徒再次向城市推进。如果一切按计划进行，零号机将在接下来的几分钟内部署，而真嗣将作为 EVA 驾驶员迎来他灾难性的首秀。这场首秀将改变许多人的生活，尤其是这栋公寓楼里的两个人。即便此刻，他仍能听到有人在努力压抑着哭泣声。停在门前，索伦敲了敲门。

The sniffling went silent as if nothing had been there, but Soren was not fooled. There were two distinct AT signals in there, after all. Soren knocked again, not that he was expecting a response. Thus it was to his pleasant surprise that the door did open and a boy in a tracksuit appeared. Soren was struck by a faint hint of nostalgia as he looked at the boy and his face almost slipped into a smile. Almost, but Soren had not spent the last decade or so learning to maintain his composure for naught. The boy on the other hand looked at him suspiciously, obviously unsure what to make of this foreign stranger knocking at his door at a time like this.  
抽泣声戛然而止，仿佛从未存在过，但索伦并未上当。毕竟，那里有两个明显的 AT 信号。索伦再次敲门，并不指望有人回应。然而，令他意外的是，门真的开了，一个穿着运动服的男孩出现了。看着这个男孩，索伦心中涌起一丝淡淡的怀旧感，几乎要露出微笑。但索伦并未白费过去十多年学习保持镇定的功夫。而那男孩则狐疑地看着他，显然对这个在此时敲门的陌生人心存疑虑。

"Excuse me," the boy said, "but what are you doing here?"  
“不好意思，”男孩问道，“你在这里做什么？”

"I could ask you much the same," Soren said in perfect Japanese. "It is my understanding there is an evacuation order."  
“我也可以问你同样的问题，”索伦用流利的日语回答，“据我所知，这里发布了疏散命令。”

"Yeah," the boy said. "So why ain't you evacuated?"  
“是啊，”男孩说，“那你为什么不撤离？”

This time Soren did smile, not from loss of control but because he felt he could show at least that much humanity to the boy. "My wife has not returned yet. I can't very well leave without her."  
这一次，索伦确实笑了，不是因为失去控制，而是因为他觉得自己至少可以向这个男孩展示这一点人性。“我妻子还没回来。我不能就这样离开她。”

The boy looked at him in surprise before cracking a small grin of his own and nodding. "My lil sis is sick. Can't really move her by myself."  
男孩惊讶地看着他，然后露出了一个小小的微笑，点了点头。“我妹妹生病了。我一个人没法带她走。”

Soren frowned. He knew the details of course, but that did not make him any happier.  
索伦皱了皱眉。他当然知道细节，但这并没有让他感到一丝愉快。

"May I be of some help? At the least the two of you should get down to the shelters."  
“我能帮上什么忙吗？至少你们俩应该去避难所。”

"Oh uh, that's okay, I mean-"  
“哦呃，没关系，我是说——”

The world seemed to be thrown upside down as the two were thrown off their feet. Soren recovered more quickly, looking out the window to see Unit 01 outside. Instead of lying there letting the Angel beat on him however, Shinji had slammed his EVA into the monster. That had pushed the fight away from the apartment complex, which bought them a little bit of time. It would have to be enough.  
世界仿佛被颠倒了过来，两人被甩得失去了平衡。Soren 恢复得更快，他望向窗外，看到零号机在外面。然而，Shinji 并没有躺在那里任由使徒攻击，而是猛地将他的 EVA 撞向了怪物。这一举动将战斗推离了公寓大楼，为他们争取了一点时间。这已经足够了。

"Where's your sister?" Soren snapped.  
“你妹妹在哪儿？”Soren 厉声问道。

The boy pulled himself up and jerked his head back inside. "Bedroom."  
男孩挣扎着站起来，猛地回头向屋内示意。“卧室。”

Soren wasted little time, bursting in and finding the little girl curled up in her bed. Without giving her a chance to react, he picked her up and hauled her out into the halls.  
索伦毫不耽搁，破门而入，发现小女孩蜷缩在床上。没给她反应的机会，他一把抱起她，迅速带到了走廊上。

"Let's go," he said. “我们走，”他说道。

Suzuhara Sakura looked about in a panic before catching sight of her brother.  
铃原樱慌乱地四处张望，终于看到了她的哥哥。

"Nii-san!" "哥哥！"

"It's alright," Toji assured her. "He's here to help."  
"没事的，" 冬二安慰她。"他是来帮忙的。"

Sakura stopped struggling, instead tightening her hold on Soren. Nevertheless her gaze remained on her big brother, seeking assurances that everything would be alright. Toji offered her a smile even as they ran and eventually Sakura returned it.  
樱花停止了挣扎，反而更紧地抱住了索伦。然而她的目光依旧停留在她的大哥身上，寻求着一切都会好起来的保证。冬二一边跑一边向她微笑，最终樱花也回以微笑。

The three had made it out of the apartment and Soren quickly caught sight of a shelter entrance. He began toward it when Sakura began struggling again.  
三人成功逃出公寓，索伦很快发现了一个避难所的入口。他正要朝那里走去，樱却再次挣扎起来。

"Nii-san!" “哥哥！”

Halting abruptly, Soren turned around and saw the boy staring at the carnage before them. Unit 01 had torn off the Angel's arm and blood rained down upon the cityscape. Even now the EVA was busy smashing away at its opponent, raining blow after blow onto the red core.  
索伦猛地停下脚步，转身看到男孩正凝视着他们面前的惨状。初号机已经撕掉了使徒的手臂，鲜血如雨般洒落在城市上空。即便此刻，EVA 仍在不停地猛击对手，一拳接一拳地砸向那红色的核心。

"Boy!" Soren shouted, shaking Toji out of his shock.  
“小子！”索伦大喊，摇醒了呆若木鸡的冬二。

Toji scrambled after them, but his lapse had cost them dearly. The Angel suddenly jerked up and wrapped itself around the EVA. Soren cursed. They were out of time. Hugging Sakura tightly against his chest, he raised his free hand. And then the world disappeared in a bright flash.  
冬二慌忙追赶，但刚才的失神已让他们付出了惨重代价。使徒突然猛地一跃，紧紧缠绕在 EVA 身上。索伦咒骂一声。时间已尽。他将樱紧紧搂在胸前，空出的手高高举起。随后，世界在一片耀眼的闪光中消失。

---

Shinji's eyes snapped open, his mind a flurry of panic and confusion even as his heartbeat continued on a steady and measured tempo. The tiled ceiling was a sterile white, not helped by the harsh fluorescent lighting that blanketed the room. Rising slowly, Shinji noticed the IV in his arm. Deciding it was best not to try pulling it out himself, he simply sat there trying to gather his thoughts. He had a vague idea of why he was in this place, presumably a hospital. He had fought in a battle, piloting for the first time some giant robot. That he was still alive suggested he won, though how was still fuzzy. But despite the haziness of his memories, one thing did cut straight through, the words that Misato's foreign friend said to him before he climbed into the EVA.  
真嗣的眼睛猛地睁开，心中一片慌乱与迷茫，心跳却依旧平稳有节奏。瓷砖天花板是一片无菌的白色，刺眼的荧光灯照亮了整个房间。真嗣缓缓坐起，注意到手臂上的静脉注射。他决定最好不要自己拔掉，只是坐在那里试图理清思绪。他隐约知道自己为何在这个地方，大概是一家医院。他曾参与一场战斗，首次驾驶那台巨型机器人。他还活着，意味着他赢了，尽管细节仍模糊不清。但尽管记忆朦胧，有一件事却清晰无比，那是美里那位外国朋友在他登上 EVA 前对他说的话。

"You can fight because you don't want to get hurt, or you can fight because you don't want others to be hurt. The choice is yours, Ikari Shinji, and I think you know which one you've already made. Just never forget that."  
"你可以因为不想受伤而战斗，也可以因为不想别人受伤而战斗。选择权在你，碇真嗣，我想你已经知道自己的选择了。只是永远不要忘记这一点。"

Had he made a choice? Perhaps he had, Shinji conceded. After all, how could he not after holding that bleeding girl in his arms. Looking at his hands, Shinji cringed. Just what kind of monster was his father that he would send someone so hurt out into battle? And just what was the approval of such a man worth? Shinji shook his head. It hurt from trying to think about all this and he had yet to find any answers in his headache. It felt as if he would never untie the thorny knot of emotions that tore at him. If only someone else could do it for him.  
他做出了选择吗？也许他做了，真嗣承认。毕竟，在怀里抱着那个流血的女孩之后，他怎么可能不做出选择。看着自己的双手，真嗣皱起了眉头。他的父亲究竟是什么样的怪物，竟然会让如此受伤的人上战场？而这样一个男人的认可又有什么价值？真嗣摇了摇头。试图思考这一切让他头疼，而他还没有找到任何答案。感觉就像他永远解不开那纠结着他的情感之结。如果有人能替他解决这一切就好了。

"He's an idiot." "他是个傻瓜。"

Misato looked up at the seemingly sullen woman in her office and smirked.  
美里抬头看着办公室里那个看似闷闷不乐的女人，嘴角微微上扬。

"Talking about your beloved husband again?"  
“又在说你那心爱的丈夫了？”

There was something almost endearing about the way Amanda Sommer-Reimer was ever so willing to lay out her husband's faults and flaws in blunt and direct ways. The frequency in which she did so tended to increase exponentially when he was physically present, but the other German remained as aloof as ever even when his wife was badmouthing him. The real entertainment however came in when he decided to snark back at her, still in that trademark aloof manner, and Amanda's exaggerated reactions were always good fun to watch.  
阿曼达·索默-莱默尔总是毫不掩饰地直陈她丈夫的缺点和瑕疵，这种坦率的方式几乎让人觉得有些可爱。她这样做的时候，频率通常会在他本人在场时呈指数级增长，但那位德国人即便在妻子诋毁他时也依旧保持着一贯的冷漠。真正的乐趣在于，当他决定以那种标志性的冷漠方式回呛她时，阿曼达夸张的反应总是令人捧腹。

Amanda snorted. "That's a given. No, I'm talking about that retarded man-child of a commander of yours."  
阿曼达哼了一声。“那是当然。不，我说的是你那位智障般幼稚的指挥官。”

The smirk disappeared to be replaced with a frown as Misato regarded her friend.  
美里看着她的朋友，嘴角的笑意消失，取而代之的是皱眉。

"May I, ah, assume that your report will include a similar such conclusion, albeit worded a bit more tactfully?"  
“我可以，呃，假设你的报告会得出类似的结论，尽管措辞会更委婉些吗？”

"You may," Amanda said, dropping her legs from the other chair she was resting them on and sitting up to face Misato. "As the duly appointed UN Auditor-General for NERV-Tokyo, it's my job to make sure that NERV is doing its job to the best of its abilities. That includes the most effective use of its personnel resources, and if I'm not mistaken then Shinji Ikari will be a most important resource."  
"你可以，" 阿曼达说着，将搭在另一张椅子上的双腿放下，坐直身子面对美里。"作为联合国任命的 NERV 东京审计总长，我的职责是确保 NERV 尽其所能履行职责。这包括最有效地利用其人力资源，如果我没记错的话，碇真嗣将是一个非常重要的资源。"

"He's a person, not a resource," Misato said somewhat defensively.  
"他是个人，不是资源，" 美里有些防备地说道。"

"I know," Amanda said. "Which brings us back to my original comment."  
"我知道，" 阿曼达说。"这让我们回到了我最初的评论。"

Amanda stared levelly at Misato and the other woman could not help but look away. Her friend had a point, both spoken and unspoken. While the commander had not exactly conducted himself in the best light, Misato's own actions towards Shinji were hard to defend as well. After all, there was no getting around the fact that they had harangued a 14 year old boy into fighting a multi-story tall monster, that they would likely need to do it again, and if he ever chose not to fight humanity was well and truly screwed. And as Amanda was making clear, it was as much her job to make sure such eventualities did not happen as it was Misato's.  
阿曼达平静地凝视着美里，后者不禁移开了目光。她的朋友所言，无论是明言还是暗示，都颇有道理。尽管指挥官的行为并未完全展现出最佳一面，但美里对待真嗣的举动同样难以辩解。毕竟，无法回避的事实是，他们逼迫一个 14 岁的少年去对抗一只多层楼高的怪兽，很可能还需要他再次挺身而出，而一旦他选择不再战斗，人类将彻底陷入绝境。正如阿曼达所明确指出的，确保此类情况不发生，既是美里的职责，也是她的责任。

Due to the turmoil of the post-Second Impact world, the UN had been forced to deal with a variety of minor crises and bushfires on a nearly continuous basis. It quickly learned that nipping problems in the bud was a much better long term strategy than letting problems simmer until they exploded into some large scale disaster. To that end the UN began employing dedicated troubleshooters, who generally fell into two categories. Auditors like one Amanda Sommer were generally fixed assignment officers, stationed in one place for a long period of time to monitor the day-to-day situation and deal with any problems that cropped up. Inspectors like a certain ex that shall not be named generally only showed up if there was an imminent crisis or upon the request of an auditor if said auditor felt outside support was needed.  
由于第二次冲击后世界的动荡，联合国被迫几乎持续不断地应对各种小危机和突发事件。它很快认识到，防患于未然远比任由问题发酵直至演变成大规模灾难更为长远的策略。为此，联合国开始聘用专门的危机处理人员，他们大致分为两类。像阿曼达·萨默这样的审计员通常是固定岗位官员，长期驻扎在某地，监控日常状况并处理任何突发问题。而像某位不愿透露姓名的前任督察员，通常只在面临迫在眉睫的危机时出现，或是在审计员认为需要外部支援时，应审计员请求而介入。

Amanda had served as auditor-general for NERV-Berlin for five years before her reassignment to NERV-Tokyo and her tenure there was actually fondly looked upon by the Berlin staff. Sure Amanda had been an outsider, an interloper sent to breathe down their necks to make sure they were doing their job, but Amanda had proven them wrong. She had basically adopted the staff as her own, looking out for their best interests not only as members of NERV but also as people. This had eventually resulted in a hilarious confrontation between herself and another UN oversight official over the matter of maternity leave and day-care services, a confrontation that Amanda had won without even needing to put the man in the hospital for blood lose, solidly putting all the women of NERV-Berlin in her camp. That meant that the staff was all the more willing to go to her if there were problems and by the time of Amanda's reassignment NERV-Berlin had one of the highest efficiency and morale ratings of any of the NERV branches, much to the chagrin of NERV-Tokyo's previous auditor, Misato knew.  
阿曼达在调任 NERV 东京分部之前，曾担任 NERV 柏林分部的审计长五年，她在柏林的任期实际上深受柏林员工的爱戴。诚然，阿曼达是个外来者，一个被派来监督他们工作、确保他们尽职的闯入者，但她用实际行动证明了自己的价值。她几乎将员工视如己出，不仅作为 NERV 的一员，更是作为个体，关心他们的最大利益。最终，这导致了一场关于产假和日托服务的滑稽对峙，她与另一位联合国监督官员针锋相对，而阿曼达甚至无需让对方因失血住院就赢得了这场较量，稳稳地将 NERV 柏林的所有女性员工拉入了自己的阵营。这意味着员工们更愿意在遇到问题时向她求助，而到了阿曼达调任之时，NERV 柏林分部的效率和士气评级在所有 NERV 分支中名列前茅，这一点，美里是知道的，令 NERV 东京先前的审计官颇为懊恼。

Now that Amanda was here, Misato did not doubt her friend would be applying her considerable energies towards rectifying any similar problems she might come upon. If Amanda really did decide that one Gendo Ikari was one such problem, things could get very sticky.  
既然阿曼达已经来了，美里毫不怀疑她的朋友会用她那非凡的精力去纠正她可能遇到的任何类似问题。如果阿曼达真的决定认为碇源堂是一个问题，事情可能会变得非常棘手。

"Amanda, I know the commander didn't give you a very good first impression," Misato began, "but he is the commander and there is a method to his madness."  
“阿曼达，我知道指挥官给你的第一印象不太好，”美里开始说道，“但他毕竟是指挥官，他的疯狂是有章法的。”

Amanda gave Misato a deadpan look.  
阿曼达面无表情地看了美里一眼。

"Maybe," Misato conceded.  
“或许吧，”美里让步道。

"Correct me if I'm wrong, but did the commander not send out a completely untrained and untested pilot against an Angel?" Amanda began. "Despite the fact that we have two trained pilots in Germany and another in America? Any three of whom we could have gotten on a supersonic jet to get them to Tokyo-3 within an hour and deployed in Unit 01."  
“如果我错了请纠正，但指挥官不是派了一个完全没有训练和实战经验的驾驶员去对抗使徒吗？”阿曼达开始说道，“尽管我们在德国有两名训练有素的驾驶员，在美国还有一名？这三人中的任何一个我们都可以用超音速飞机在一小时内送到第三新东京市，并部署在零号机中。”

"Yes," Misato tiredly agreed.  
“是的，”美里疲惫地同意道。

"And then there's his method of motivating Shinji, or I suppose his complete lack of attempt at it."  
"然后就是他激励真嗣的方法，或者我猜他根本就没有尝试过。"

Again Misato nodded, not finding anything she could disagree with in her friend's statement.  
米莎托再次点头，她朋友的这番话里没有任何她能反驳的地方。

Amanda sighed and shook her head. "I don't know what the hell that asshole's trying to do, but if the intent is to actually use Shinji as an actual pilot, then the commander did went out of his way to do everything wrong. Shinji should have been brought in weeks ago, given some time to actually acclimate to being a pilot and at least given some rudimentary combat training. The only thing throwing him to the wolves like that should have accomplished is gotten the boy killed."  
阿曼达叹了口气，摇了摇头。“我不知道那个混蛋到底想干什么，但如果他的目的是真的把真嗣当作一名实际的驾驶员来使用，那么司令官确实是一错再错。真嗣本应在几周前就被引入，给他一些时间去适应成为一名驾驶员，至少应该接受一些基本的战斗训练。那样把他扔进狼群，唯一能达成的结果就是让那孩子丧命。”

"But he wasn't killed," Misato pointed out. "He won."  
"但他并没有被杀，"美里指出。"他赢了。"

"Unit 01 won," Amanda countered. "We were both there on the bridge and you don't seriously believe that Shinji was the one going on a wild rampage ripping the Angel to pieces?"  
"初号机赢了，"阿曼达反驳道。"我们当时都在桥上，你真的相信是真嗣在疯狂地撕扯使徒吗？"

Reluctantly Misato shook her head.  
美里不情愿地摇了摇头。

"What I thought. We got lucky this time, but if NERV's only game plan is to rely on luck then it's not doing its job at all."  
"我也是这么想的。这次我们侥幸逃脱，但如果 NERV 的唯一策略就是依赖运气，那它根本没尽到职责。"

"So what do you plan to do about it?" Misato asked.  
"那你打算怎么办？" 美里问道。"

"Nothing immediate beyond filing a report ripping Gendo a new one," Amanda said. "Right now though our problem is Shinji. He's the only person physically able to pilot right now and if another Angel shows up before we can transfer the Second or Fourth, he needs to be ready."  
"目前除了提交一份痛批源堂的报告外，没有立即的行动，" 阿曼达说。"但现在我们的问题是真嗣。他是目前唯一能驾驶的人，如果在我们转移二号或四号机之前又有使徒出现，他必须做好准备。"

"Sounds fair," said Misato. "Assuming he's willing to continue piloting."  
"听起来挺公平的，" 美里说。"前提是他愿意继续驾驶。"

"That's your job," Amanda said. "Though even assuming he does, he's an emotional trainwreck. I'll need to assign him a few therapy sessions at the very least if he stays."  
"那是你的工作，" 阿曼达说。"不过就算他愿意，他现在情绪一团糟。如果他留下，我至少得给他安排几次心理治疗。"

"That, might actually not be a bad idea," Misato said.  
"那，其实可能真是个不错的主意，" 美里说。"

The phone rang before Amanda could reply and Misato quickly picked it up to make sure her friend did not get a chance.  
电话在阿曼达回复之前响起，美里迅速接起，确保她的朋友没有机会插话。

"Yes? Alright, understood." She stood and hung up. "Shinji-kun's awake."  
“喂？好的，明白了。”她站起身挂断电话。“真嗣醒了。”

Amanda nodded but made no move. "Then you better go check up on him."  
阿曼达点点头，但没有动身。“那你最好去看看他。”

"Coming?" “来吗？”

A shake of the head. "I've still got some paperwork to deal with after that last battle. And something tells me that you're the one that really should be looking out for him, Hauptmann Misato Katsuragi."  
他摇了摇头。“上次战斗后我还有些文书工作要处理。而且，我觉得真正应该照顾他的人是你，上尉葛城美里。”

---

The hospital was mostly quite beyond a few random PA calls for some doctor or another. Shinji looked out the window into the Geofront, not really seeing anything but just letting his senses wander. The rustling of wheels caught his attention and he turned about to see a gurney roll past. There lay the blue-haired girl that he had met before getting into the EVA, bandages still covering much of her body. The two locked eyes as she was wheeled past and Shinji somehow managed to resist the urge to look away. He had gotten into the EVA because she could not. He had gotten hurt because she was already hurt. That foreign woman's words echoed in his mind over and over again as his fist tightened. Thus he stayed until Misato made her appearance.  
医院里大部分时间都很安静，除了偶尔会有一些呼叫某位医生的广播。真嗣望向窗外，看着地底都市，其实什么也没看进去，只是任由自己的感官游走。一阵轮子滚动的声音吸引了他的注意，他转过身，看到一辆担架车推过。上面躺着那个蓝发女孩，他之前在进入 EVA 前遇到过她，绷带依然覆盖着她大部分的身体。两人目光交汇，她被推过时，真嗣不知怎的忍住了移开视线的冲动。他进入 EVA 是因为她不能。他受伤是因为她已经受伤了。那个外国女人的话在他脑海中一遍遍回响，他的拳头紧握。就这样，他一直待到美里出现。

"Shinji-kun." "真嗣君。"

The voice was almost gentle and the concern Shinji saw on her face looked quite genuine.  
那声音几乎温柔，她脸上的关切之情看起来相当真切。

"Katsuragi-san." "葛城小姐。"

A playful bop descended on his head. "That's Misato, remember?"  
一个调皮的敲击落在了他的头上。“那是美里，记得吗？”

"Ow. Uh right, Misato-san."  
“哎哟。呃，对，美里小姐。”

"How are you feeling?" “你感觉怎么样？”

"Umm, okay I guess. I don't remember much."  
"嗯，好吧，我想是的。我不记得太多。"

"That's alright, it'll come back eventually," Misato said reassuringly. "C'mon, let's get you checked out. I'm sure you're eager to get out of here."  
"没关系，最终会想起来的，"美里安慰地说道，"来吧，让我们给你检查一下。我相信你一定很想离开这里。"

Shinji simply nodded and followed the older woman back to his room. After a few minutes changing into clean clothes and Misato signing some paperwork, the two headed for the exit elevator. When it opened however, neither moved. Before the two stood Gendo Ikari, commander of NERV and Shinji's father. The teen flinched and felt his body tense up. Almost reflexively his gaze started tearing away, but something forced him to hold his father's gaze. The man's eyes were cold, hard, and with absolutely no remorse or concern. Shinji found his own growing harder with every passing second. Then, Gendo blinked. Shinji's eyes flickered in surprise but before anything could be said or done the elevator doors closed once more. As he stood there bewildered, Shinji did not notice Misato gazing at him, concern once more etched across her own face. Things were just getting started after all.  
真嗣只是点点头，跟着那位年长的女性回到了他的房间。几分钟后，他换上了干净的衣服，美里签了一些文件，两人便向出口电梯走去。然而，当电梯门打开时，两人都没有动。站在他们面前的是源堂·碇，NERV 的指挥官，也是真嗣的父亲。少年不禁一颤，感到身体紧绷起来。几乎是本能地，他的目光开始移开，但某种力量迫使他保持与父亲的目光对视。那个男人的眼神冰冷、坚硬，没有丝毫的悔意或关心。真嗣发现自己的眼神也随着每一秒过去而变得更加坚硬。然后，源堂眨了眨眼。真嗣的眼睛惊讶地闪烁了一下，但还没等任何话或动作发生，电梯门再次关闭了。当他站在那里困惑时，真嗣没有注意到美里正注视着他，担忧再次刻画在她的脸上。毕竟，一切才刚刚开始。

End Prologue 终章序幕

By all rights I really should not be starting this project while Darkness Risen is still unfinished. The problem of course is that I have a problematic writer's block for that story. I know what needs to happen within the next two/three chapters that I expect will end that story, but I just haven't been able to write any scenes. And so this story is basically me venting and giving my creative energy an outlet.  
按理说，我真不该在黑暗崛起还未完结时就开始这个项目。当然，问题在于我对那篇故事遇到了棘手的写作障碍。我知道接下来两三章需要发生什么，预计会结束那篇故事，但我就是写不出任何场景。所以，这篇故事基本上是我发泄和释放创造力的出口。

In Tune can actually be considered a major reworking and expansion of one of my much earlier pieces, one that never truly developed. For this one however I have a fairly concrete idea of where I want it to go. I think the basic premise will be obvious to most fans of the EVA fandom, along with what 'type' of EVA fic this is. And if it is not blindingly obvious already, only one 'named' character in this story can actually be considered a completely 'new' character to the EVA universe. I'll let all of you figure out who's who. And yes, quite a few other characters will be getting 'reintroduced' as well.  
《和谐共鸣》实际上可以看作是我早期一篇未真正发展起来的作品的重大重写和扩展。而对于这篇，我有一个相当明确的方向。我想，对于大多数 EVA 粉丝来说，基本前提和这篇 EVA 同人文的类型应该很明显。如果还不够明显，这篇故事中只有一个‘命名’角色可以被认为是 EVA 宇宙中完全‘新’的角色。我会让你们自己猜猜谁是谁。没错，还有不少其他角色也会被‘重新介绍’。

Ultimately I'm not going to try to make this a big mystery per se, there will be parts that are vague and are foreshadow, but I generally find it more interesting to just write the interactions of characters and reflections of their inner thoughts. This is why I've created the particular setup I have here. So for the most part, quite a few of the background items should be easily guessable, or I think so at least. Either way, I hope you all enjoy this first bit. I make no promises about rate of updates, though chapter 1 already has about 1500 words/3.5 pages written. Prologue is about 4600 words. I'll let you all extrapolate.  
最终，我并不打算将此打造成一个纯粹的谜团，其中会有部分内容模糊并预示未来，但我通常认为直接描写角色的互动和内心想法更有趣。这就是我为何设定这样的背景。因此，大部分背景元素应该不难猜测，至少我是这么认为的。无论如何，希望你们喜欢这开篇部分。至于更新速度，我无法做出保证，不过chapter 1 已经写了大约 1500 字/3.5 页。序章大约 4600 字。我会让你们自行推断。

Mandatory Disclaimer: I don't own EVA, though if I did I'd have gotten the last damn movie out already. And paid for more readable fonts than what they're using for subs in the official BD releases.  
强制性免责声明：我不拥有 EVA，尽管如果我拥有的话，最后一部该死的电影早就该上映了。而且我会支付比官方蓝光版字幕所用的更易读的字体。

...
### Chapter 51 Epilogue Delta 854 M41
"Admiral Rokubungi, CIC has completed analysis of the sensor telemetry from the probes."  
罗库本吉上将，CIC 已完成对探测器遥测数据的分析。

The broad-shouldered man in the formal dress of a lord admiral of the Imperial Fleet nodded towards the rating that delivered the message.  
这位肩宽体阔的男子身着帝国舰队上将的正式礼服，向传递消息的士兵点头示意。

"Notify my squadron commanders that I want all of them online for a briefing in ten minutes," Shinji ordered.  
“通知我的中队指挥官们，十分钟后我要他们全部上线参加简报会议，”真嗣命令道。

"Yes sir." "是的，长官。"

In the end it only took five for the senior officers of Battlefleet Dammerung to all connect to the command network and over a dozen faces were projected with crystal clarity to one side of the command station Shinji stood at.  
最终，只用了五分钟，达姆拉星际舰队的高级军官们就全部连接到了指挥网络，十几张面孔以水晶般的清晰度投影到了真嗣所在的指挥站一侧。

"Ladies and gentlemen," he greeted, "the time draws near when we will be called upon to face the Tyranid threat once more. We have twice turned back the xenos scourge on a grand scale and defeated countless other smaller fleets. Now however we face a threat equal if not even greater than that presented by Behemoth and Kraken. Tarsis Ultra has already paid heavily to stymie the hive fleet's advance but if we do not stop them here in the void then there may well be no stopping Leviathan from advancing upon Terra herself."  
"女士们，先生们，"他问候道，"我们即将再次面对泰伦威胁的时刻临近了。我们曾两次在大规模上击退了异形灾祸，并击败了无数其他小型舰队。然而现在，我们面临的威胁即使不比贝希摩斯和克拉肯所展现的更大，也至少是同等级别的。塔尔西斯超星区已经为阻止虫巢舰队的推进付出了沉重的代价，但如果我们不在虚空中阻止它们，那么利维坦很可能就会直逼地球本身。""

Grim nods agreed with the admiral's words, from the commanders of his battle squadrons to the officers commanding his escort flotillas. Shinji nodded in turn before looking over at another officer on his command bridge.  
格瑞姆点头赞同了上将的话，从他的战斗中队指挥官到指挥他护航舰队的军官们。真嗣也跟着点头，随后看向指挥桥上的另一位军官。

"Commodore, if you would."  
“准将，请您来吧。”

"My lord," the officer said and the attention of the attendees shifted to him as he worked his console. "At present the hive fleet seems to still be unaware of our location, though they did notice the presence of our probes. Our scouts were however able to avoid detection. With ansible communication increasingly unreliable thanks to the gravitational warping effects of the Tyranid narvhal and the shadow blocking our psykers, the information presented here is already several days out of date. It does however represent our most complete picture of what we will be facing."  
“大人，”军官说道，与会者的注意力随之转向他，他操作着控制台。“目前看来，虫巢舰队似乎仍未察觉我们的位置，尽管它们注意到了我们的探测器。不过，我们的侦察兵成功避开了探测。由于泰伦纳维尔的引力扭曲效应和阻挡我们灵能者的阴影，通过安塞尔通信的信息越来越不可靠，这里展示的信息已经过时了几天。但它确实代表了我们将要面对的最完整的画面。”

A projection appeared on the main holographic display and each of the attending officers were sent the same data for local viewing. Frowns and tightened lips greeted what they saw.  
主全息显示屏上出现了投影，每位出席的军官都收到了相同的数据以供本地查看。他们所见之物引来了皱眉和紧抿的嘴唇。

"The sensor telemetry returned by the scouts indicate that the hive fleet we face has approximately forty-six hive ships. Escort numbers are more tentative but CIC's confidence is high that there are more than two hundred smaller bio-ships in the fleet."  
侦察兵返回的传感器遥测数据显示，我们面对的蜂群舰队约有四十六艘蜂巢船。护航舰的数量较为不确定，但指挥中心的信心很高，认为舰队中有超过两百艘较小的生物舰。

Which actually put the two forces at near parity when it came to raw numbers with the battlefleet having a slight advantage. However quantity was never the whole story, quality also played a bit part. There was nearly a hundred cruisers under Shinji's command and nearly twice that many escorts. But it was the capital ships that might well prove decisive and here the battlefleet only had twenty-four, split into three squadrons of eight plus an assortment of smaller vessels serving as screening elements. Nearly two-to-one odds against the fleet. But then there was the _Dammerung_ herself, of which Battlefleet Dammerung was a namesake of.  
实际上，在原始数量上，这两支力量几乎势均力敌，舰队略占优势。然而，数量从来不是全部，质量也起着重要作用。真嗣指挥下几乎有一百艘巡洋舰和近两倍数量的护航舰。但决定性的可能是主力舰，而舰队只有二十四艘，分成三个八艘的中队，外加一些作为掩护元素的小型舰艇。舰队几乎面临二比一的劣势。但随后有“黄昏号”本身，黄昏舰队正是以其命名的。

At ten times the length of a standard battleship and five times the width at its widest point, the _Dammerung_ was the first of its class and one of the rarest warships in the entire Imperial Navy. Only eight had been built over the twelve millennia since the _Dammerung_ herself but each one represented a monumentally powerful weapons platform. Combined with the refits of newer weapons each underwent every few centuries, a single one of the massive dreadnoughts could engage entire fleets alone and emerge effectively unscathed. And then there was its primary gun, a mass driver capable of accelerating a projectile half the length of a frigate to several percentages the speed of light when first constructed. Since the Dammerung's last major refit five centuries ago, the top speed had increased to near luminal velocities. These days the biggest problem really was just finding a target they could use to test fire the weapon to make sure it was still working without the risk of giving someone a really nasty surprise a few decades or even centuries later unintentionally. There were also very strict regulations regarding the use of the weapon in an inhabited system seeing as the weapon could easily crack the mantle of a planet. This time though, they were in the void of space and the angle of approach would permit the Dammerung to engage with a relatively clear path of fire even if the projectile ended up blowing right through its targets.  
长达标准战列舰十倍、最宽处为五倍宽度的“达姆朗”号，不仅是其级别的首舰，更是整个帝国海军中最为稀有的战舰之一。自“达姆朗”号诞生以来的这万二千年间，仅建造了八艘，每一艘都代表着一座威力无比的武器平台。随着每隔几百年进行的新武器改装，这些庞大的无畏舰单凭一己之力便能迎战整支舰队，且几乎毫发无损。而其主炮——一门质量加速器，在最初建造时便能将一枚长度达护卫舰一半的弹丸加速至光速的数个百分点。自五百年前“达姆朗”号上次大规模改装以来，最高速度已提升至接近光速。如今，最大的难题反倒是寻找一个合适的靶子来试射这门武器，以确保其正常运作，同时避免无意间在数十年乃至数百年后给某人带来一场不愉快的意外。 在有人居住的星系中，关于武器使用的规章制度非常严格，因为这种武器很容易使行星的地幔破裂。不过这次，他们身处太空的虚无之中，接近的角度将允许“达姆朗”号即使在弹丸直接穿透目标的情况下，也能拥有一条相对清晰的射击路径。

"Currently there is no indication of any new bio-ship types, though that has generally been less of an issue with the Tyranid's spacefaring types than their ground ones. We cannot however discount minute variations and deviations from the established base types the Imperium has already encountered."  
目前没有迹象表明有新型生物战舰出现，尽管泰伦虫族的太空类型通常比地面类型的问题要少。但我们不能忽视与帝国已知基础类型相比的细微变化和偏差。

That was certainly true enough, the Tyranids demonstrated an astounding ability to adapt to whatever challenges they faced. When they encountered the bolter weapons of the Adeptus Astartes, they developed a composite-like armor able to absorb much of the kinetic energy from a round's detonation. After first being brushed aside by a company of Baneblades, the next time around they brought forth a massive creature able to actually crack the tank's armor with its sharp tusks. It was a neverending biological arms race and one that the Imperium was just barely winning. The lesson that everyone took from the battles however was that the most effective way to defeat a Tyranid invasion was to engage a hivefleet before it got close enough to land an invasion force. Once the fighting reached planetside, the price of victory climbed exponentially.  
这确实不假，泰伦虫族展现出了惊人的适应能力，无论面对何种挑战。当它们遭遇阿斯塔特修士的爆弹武器时，它们进化出了一种复合装甲，能够吸收大部分弹丸爆炸产生的动能。在被一队毁灭之剑轻易击退后，下一次它们便带来了一头巨兽，其锋利的獠牙竟能撕裂坦克的装甲。这是一场永无止境的生物军备竞赛，而帝国仅勉强取胜。然而，从这些战斗中人们得出的教训是，击败泰伦入侵最有效的方法是在它们接近到足以登陆入侵部队之前就进行拦截。一旦战斗蔓延至行星表面，胜利的代价将呈指数级增长。

"At their present rate of travel they will be entering the Shadowbrink System within five weeks. Evacuations have removed approximately 30% of the planetary population, but there is a considerable force of Astartes and Imperial Guards still on the surface. They appear to be fortifying, preparing to engage the Tyranids should they make planetfall."  
按照目前的行进速度，它们将在五周内进入暗影边缘星系。疏散行动已撤离了约 30%的行星人口，但仍有大量阿斯塔特修士和帝国卫队驻守在地表。他们似乎正在加固防御，准备在泰伦虫族登陆时与之交战。

"Whatever for?" one of Shinji's senior fleet commanders blurted out before catching himself. "Apologies, lord admiral."  
“为何如此？”申吉的一位资深舰队指挥官脱口而出，随即意识到失言，“抱歉，海军上将大人。”

"Valid questions need no pardon," Shinji said, "and yours is a valid question, admiral. I have pressed the Astartes commander for an explanation but have thus far received only vague comments about some duty that binds them to Shadowbrink. Seeing as they are outside our chain of command I cannot issue a formal order for him to evacuate. At present the only thing we can do is win this battle and keep the Tyranids from reaching the planet."  
“合理的问题无需道歉，”申吉回应道，“你的疑问确实有理，指挥官。我已向阿斯塔特指挥官施压要求解释，但至今只得到关于某种束缚他们于暗影壁垒的职责的模糊回答。鉴于他们不在我们的指挥链内，我无法正式命令他撤离。目前我们唯一能做的就是赢得这场战斗，阻止泰伦虫族抵达星球。”

More grim nods. 更多的沉重点头。

"The duty before us is clear," Shinji continued. "We will meet Leviathan in three days' time. Let all carry out his or her duty to the utmost, in the Empress' name."  
"我们面前的任务明确无误，" 真嗣继续说道。"我们将在三天后迎战利维坦。愿所有人尽其所能，以女皇之名。"

"In the Empress' name." "以女皇之名。"

---

Several hours had passed since the briefing and Shinji was finally retiring to his quarters. The battle plan he had originally formulated was updated appropriately based on the latest intelligence and one last training exercise was run based on the modifications. Now the fleet was simply performing final maintenance checks, refueling, rearming, and preparing for the biggest fight they had yet to see. As Shinji entered his rather palatial quarters he saw his wife floating in midair, legs crossed and eyes closed. Her blue hair swayed gently as she bobbed up and down ever so slightly and Shinji found himself smiling at the sight.  
简报结束后的几个小时里，真嗣终于回到了自己的住处。根据最新情报，他最初制定的作战计划已适当更新，并基于修改后的方案进行了最后一次训练演习。现在，舰队正在进行最后的维护检查、加油、重新武装，并为即将到来的最大战斗做准备。当真嗣走进他那颇为豪华的住处时，他看到妻子悬浮在空中，双腿交叉，双眼紧闭。她的蓝色长发轻轻摇曳，身体微微上下浮动，真嗣看着这一幕，不禁露出了微笑。

"Ayanami." "绫波。"

A pair of red eyes opened and regarded Shinji.  
一双红眸睁开，注视着真嗣。

"Rokubungi." Rei lowered herself until she was once more on the bed. "There is a message for you."  
"六分仪。" 绫波俯身，再次躺回床上。"有你的消息。"

Shinji frowned. "You were able to get past the shadow?"  
真嗣皱起眉头。“你能通过那片阴影吗？”

A nod and now Shinji could see clearly the sheen of sweat on his wife's forehead. Rei climbed off the bed and walked over to an apparatus installed into their room. It was a neural interface designed to help a psyker transfer data that they received, filtering out noise and distilling it down to the actual content. Shinji walked over and watched his wife work. While he possessed only a slight physic talent, Rei was widely acknowledged as one of the most powerful psykers to have emerged in centuries if not millennia. That had actually complicated their getting married as many figures of authority had urged Rei to choose a partner that would allow for a higher chance of their children also attaining such levels of power. Shinji had not taken such interference, direct or indirect, well. Neither had Rei for that matter and it was more the threat of alienating her from further service to the Imperium that finally caused said authorities to back down. Shinji would have loved to break a few of those figures personally but he knew not to ask for too much and remained content with simply being able to marry his love.  
她点了点头，现在真嗣能清楚地看到妻子额头上闪烁的汗珠。绫波从床上下来，走向房间里安装的一个装置。这是一台神经接口设备，旨在帮助灵能者传输他们接收到的数据，过滤掉噪音并提炼出实际内容。真嗣走过去，看着妻子操作。尽管他只拥有微弱的灵能天赋，但绫波被广泛认为是几个世纪甚至几千年以来最强大的灵能者之一。这实际上给他们的婚姻带来了复杂性，因为许多权威人士敦促绫波选择一个伴侣，以提高他们的孩子也达到这种力量水平的可能性。真嗣对这种直接或间接的干涉并不满意。绫波也是如此，最终是因为担心她会从帝国服务中被疏远，这些权威人士才最终退缩。真嗣本想亲自教训那些人，但他知道不能要求太多，只是满足于能够与心爱的人结婚。

A few minutes passed in silence as Rei completed the data transfer and she brought up a recorded message once done. As the imperial seal appeared at the start Shinji raised an eyebrow. Surely not, the man mused. As the seal disappeared however it was a man that appeared, albeit a man who had every right to use the imperial seal.  
几分钟的沉默过后，丽完成了数据传输，随后播放了一段录音信息。当帝国徽章出现在开头时，真嗣挑了挑眉。不可能是他，男子暗自思忖。然而，徽章消失后出现的人确实有资格使用帝国徽章。

"Lord Admiral Rokubungi," the man said, "this is a vermillion level communique, eyes only for yourself and your designated psyker. Her Majesty is aware that your orders to defend the Shadowbrink system is a divergence from the original mobilization plan you were granted for assembling Battlefleet Dammerung and while she has every confidence that you will discharge your orders fully despite the disruption caused, she also feels that a fuller awareness of the stakes would assist in your tactical planning."  
“洛久岸木大将，”那人说道，“这是一条朱红级别的通讯，仅供您和您指定的灵能者查阅。女王陛下知晓您保卫暗影边缘星系的命令与您组建达姆拉冈战役舰队的原始动员计划有所偏离，尽管她完全相信您会不遗余力地执行命令，尽管这会造成干扰，但她认为更全面地了解局势将有助于您的战术规划。”

Shinji raised an eyebrow. This, this did not bode well in the least. Bad enough that the Empress had ordered her psykers to attempt to punch through the shadow of the warp just to get a direct message to him, she also had her own consort, the director of Imperial Intelligence, record the message personally. And code vermillion? The highest level of communique he had ever received in the past was magenta when he was recalled for debriefing after having engaged a Necron warship. No, this message was almost certainly going to make what was already promising to be a less than pleasant experience even worse.  
真嗣挑了挑眉。这，这可不是什么好兆头。女王陛下命令她的灵能者试图突破亚空间的阴影，只为直接向他传递消息，这已经够糟糕的了，她还让自己的配偶、帝国情报局局长亲自录制这条消息。而且还是绯红色代码？他过去收到的最高级别通讯不过是品红色，那还是他在与一艘 Necron 战舰交战后被召回进行汇报的时候。不，这条消息几乎肯定会把原本就注定不愉快的经历变得更糟。

"You have already been informed that Shadowbrink is garrisoned by a large force of Astartes," the recording went on. "These Astartes are of the Grey Knights chapter, charged by her Majesty in fighting the forces of Chaos where they manifest. They are on Shadowbrink because there is a daemon artifact on the planet, one which the Grey Knights have been working to seal or destroy for over a century now. They have thus far been unsuccessful."  
“你已经被告知，Shadowbrink 驻扎着一支庞大的星际战士部队，”录音继续说道。“这些星际战士是灰骑士chapter，受女王陛下之命，在混沌势力显现之处与之战斗。他们驻扎在 Shadowbrink 是因为这颗星球上有一个恶魔神器，灰骑士们一个多世纪以来一直在努力封印或摧毁它。到目前为止，他们尚未成功。”

Shinji was sorely tempted to just shut off the message instead of continuing to listen to what he was certain would be more bad news. But he was a dutiful servant of the Imperium and so he let it play on.  
真嗣非常想直接关掉这条消息，而不是继续听那些他确信会是更多坏消息的内容。但他是一名忠诚的帝国仆人，因此他让消息继续播放下去。

"The Grey Knights fear that if the Tyranids make landfall, they will stumble upon the artifact and cause it to tear a breach into the warp. Should that happen daemons would be able to enter into the materium at will. This cannot be allowed to happen, Admiral."  
“灰骑士担心，如果泰伦虫族登陆，它们可能会发现那件神器并导致其撕裂现实宇宙与混沌之间的裂隙。一旦发生这种情况，恶魔将能够随意进入物质世界。这绝不能发生，舰队司令。”

Well of course, Shinji thought sarcastically. He hardly needed to be told that, nor did he really need any further motivation to keep the Tyranids from getting to Shadowbrink. There was still over a hundred million civilians on the planet and combined with the biomass of the rest of the ecosystem the hive fleet would be able to gorge itself if it broke through the fleet and the planet's defenders.  
当然，真嗣讽刺地想。他几乎不需要被告知这一点，也不需要更多的动机来阻止泰伦虫族接近暗影壁垒。星球上仍有超过十亿平民，加上整个生态系统的生物量，如果虫巢舰队突破舰队和行星防御，它们将能够大肆吞噬。

"While the Empress understands that you feel duty-bound to defeat the hivefleet or perish trying, she has a new charge for you to undertake. Should it appear that you will be unable to prevent the Tyranids from taking Shadowbrink, you are to assist the Grey Knights with removing the artifact from the system."  
"尽管女皇理解你感到有责任击败虫群或竭尽全力，但她有新的任务交给你。如果情况显示你无法阻止泰伦虫族夺取暗影壁垒，你将协助灰骑士将那件神器从星系中移除。"

If it could be moved then why the blazes was it not before, Shinji fumed.  
如果它能被移动，那之前为什么不这么做，真见鬼，真嗣气愤地想。

"The Empress has not made this decision lightly, Admiral, as attempting to move the artifact will require lifting some of the wards currently keeping it sealed."  
"女皇并未轻易做出这个决定，舰队司令，因为试图移动神器需要解除一些目前封印它的结界。"

Of course. Shinji sighed.  
当然。真嗣叹了口气。

"Her Majesty has every confidence that you will triumph against the Tyranids, and every conviction that you will see your duties to the fullest." The man smiled, no, smirked. "Ave Imperator, Lord Admiral."  
“女王陛下坚信您能战胜泰伦虫族，并深信您会尽职尽责到底。”那人微笑着，不，是冷笑着。“向帝皇致敬，海军上将大人。”

The recording ended and Rei looked over at her husband.  
录音结束，绫波看向她的丈夫。

"What do you intend?" "你意欲何为？"

"I intend? At this point I think I intend to hand in my resignation after all this is over and retire to some out of the way planet and sit out the rest of the century in quiet obscurity."  
"我意欲何为？事到如今，我想我打算在这一切都结束后递交辞呈，退休到一个偏远星球，在默默无闻中度过余生。"

Rei smiled ever so slightly and caressed Shinji's cheek with a hand. "You would not shy away from duty so easily."  
丽微微一笑，用手轻抚真嗣的脸颊。“你不会如此轻易逃避责任。”

"No," Shinji sighed, "and at this rate if I'm still alive the next decade the Empress is liable to appoint me Lord High Admiral of Segmentum Tempestus because of her 'confidence' in me. And then I really will be stuck behind a desk."  
“不，”真嗣叹息道，“照这样下去，如果我还能活过这十年，女皇很可能会因为我所谓的‘信任’而任命我为风暴星域的海军元帅。到那时，我就真的只能被困在办公桌后了。”

Rei gave the man a comforting squeeze on the shoulder. "You will find meaning in whatever path you choose, love, and I will be there by your side."  
绫波轻轻地拍了拍他的肩膀以示安慰。“无论你选择哪条道路，你都会找到其中的意义，亲爱的，我会一直在你身边。”

Shinji took her hand and planted a kiss on it. "I pray it is so. But for now I intend to allow myself and my subordinates a few hours of sleep before I rend apart our carefully laid battle plans once again."  
真嗣握住她的手，轻轻一吻。“我真心希望如此。但现在，我打算让我和我的部下们先休息几个小时，然后再一次撕毁我们精心制定的作战计划。”

Rei wrapped one of Shinji's arms around her and walked with him towards the bed. Tomorrow they would face the bleakness of the present but tonight, their worlds would be of each other only.  
丽将真嗣的一只手臂环绕在自己身上，与他一同走向床边。明天他们将面对现实的残酷，但今晚，他们的世界只属于彼此。

End of Epilogue Delta 终章 德尔塔

I sincerely hope it is evident what settings I am borrowing materials from for the last two epilogues. Cause if it's not, then uh, yeah…  
我真诚地希望读者能看出我最后两个终章借鉴了哪些设定。如果看不出来，那么，嗯，就是那样……

In case it is not evident, the last two epilogues involve the sidesteppers reincarnated after they have crossed over to Shinji and Asuka's score. Whether they have memories of their pasts after their reincarnation is one of those details that I will keep in reserve for flexibility purposes.  
若不明显，最后两个尾声涉及的是穿越到真嗣和明日香故事中的旁观者们转世重生。他们转世后是否保留前世记忆，这些细节我将保留以备灵活处理。

There are some pretty obvious differences between the canon 40K and the version that my timeline developed into. This was, in a word, part of the collective's long term plan, the creation of a human empire that could actually endure for millennia and not end up a rotting molasses that was imploding under its own weight. One advantage of having a proper system of government and relatively stable society? Having a much bigger fleet. I don't think there was ever a single fleet that had as many battleships as what Battlefleet Dammerung is listed as having. Maybe Battlefleet Solar. Battlefleet Cadia only had twelve battleships and it was probably one of the biggest seeing as it has to guard the Cadian Gate.  
原版 40K 与我构建的时间线之间存在一些相当明显的差异。简而言之，这是集体长远计划的一部分，旨在创造一个能够真正延续千年的帝国，而非一个因自身重压而内爆的腐朽糖浆。拥有一个健全的政府体系和相对稳定的社会的一个优势？那就是拥有更庞大的舰队。我不认为有哪个舰队曾拥有过像达摩伦战团所列出的那么多战舰。或许太阳战团可以媲美。卡迪亚战团只有十二艘战舰，考虑到它必须守卫卡迪亚之门，它可能是最大的战团之一。

Anyway, with this _In Tune_ is officially complete. I have a long list of notes for things that I would need to fix if I ever decided to do a remaster but otherwise I consider it done and I can move onto other projects. For those that would like to read a work I consider to be of a similar caliber, I would recommend checking out my story _A Cold Calculus_ set in the Code Geass universe where I try to craft a more, realistic world geopolitically and militarily. For those that want a sequel to _In Tune_, well, I could be bribed if someone immortalized this story on tvtropes with its own page. :P I kid, I kid. I have a suspicion that asking for that might constitute a violation of that site's policy. Maybe? Don't know.  
无论如何，随着《In Tune》的正式完结，我手头有一长串笔记，记录着若我决定重制需要修正的细节，但除此之外，我视其为已完成，可以转向其他项目了。对于那些希望阅读我认为水准相近作品的读者，我推荐你们看看我在《反叛的鲁路修》宇宙中创作的故事《A Cold Calculus》，在那里我试图构建一个更加真实、从地缘政治和军事角度都更为精细的世界。至于想要《In Tune》续集的朋友们，嗯，如果有人能在这个故事在 tvtropes 上拥有自己的页面，我或许会被“收买”哦。:P 开玩笑的，开玩笑的。我怀疑提出这样的请求可能违反了该网站的政策，或许吧，不太确定。

Now onto the thing that I'm sure all of you really want me to get to, the list of characters. Below are all of the named characters in the story, who they are, where I got them from, and some of the basic reasoning that went into their inclusion. If I forgot anyone, let me know in the reviews and I'll put up updated lists. Otherwise it's been, fun, I suppose I could say. _In Tune_ took about eight months to complete and stands at approximately 380k words in first draft form. I don't know if that constitutes a record in terms of update speed, but if it doesn't, well, hats off to the poor sap that actually managed to get stuff out even faster.  
现在，让我们进入大家肯定最期待的部分——角色列表。以下是故事中所有有名字的角色，他们的身份，他们的来源，以及一些基本的入选理由。如果我遗漏了谁，请在评论中告诉我，我会更新列表。否则，我想可以说，这段时间挺有趣的。《和谐之音》大约花了八个月完成，初稿约有 38 万字。我不知道这算不算更新速度的纪录，但如果不算，那么，向那些能更快推出作品的可怜家伙致敬。
