### Chapter 1

Shinji Ikari, Third Child, and pilot of NERVs Evangelion Unit 01, stood under the shower head in the apartment he shared with a beer-loving Major, her equaling beer-loving pet warm-water penguin, and a rowdy redhead. On most days thoughts of two of those three would provoke certain _reactions_ in his teenage body that meant a shower was a perfect place to be. Either for the sobering cold water or…well teenage hormones and all that…  
碇真嗣，第三适格者，NERV 的 EVA 初号机驾驶员，站在他与一位爱喝啤酒的少校、她的同样爱喝啤酒的宠物温水企鹅以及一个吵闹的红发女孩合租的公寓的淋浴头下。大多数时候，想到这三个人中的两个，他的青春期身体就会产生某些反应，这意味着洗澡是一个完美的去处。无论是为了冷静的冷水，还是……好吧，青春期的荷尔蒙和所有那些……

But at this moment Shinji could only stand under the flowing water with a mind blank of everything except a feeling of relief. Tokyo-3 had been oppressively hot today. The temperature had climbed swiftly from the early morning and, combined with a bout of humidity, had made it impossible to take anything other than short panting breaths. In Shinji's more lucid moments he could remember feeling as if weights had been placed on his chest when he tried to breath during their PE lesson which their school's coach had stubbornly insisted on. At least there hadn't been a synch-test or an Angel attack today, though given how things tended to happen in this world one could always be penciled in.  
但此刻，真嗣只能站在流动的水下，脑海一片空白，除了感到一丝解脱外别无他念。今天的第三新东京市异常闷热，气温从清晨迅速攀升，加上一阵湿气，让人只能急促地喘息。在真嗣清醒的时刻，他记得在学校的体育课上，每当他试图呼吸时，胸口仿佛压上了重物，尽管教练固执地坚持上课。至少今天没有同步测试或使徒袭击，尽管在这个世界里，这些事情总是随时可能发生。

So focused was the Third Child on this day's unpleasant weather and the shower's palliative effects that he failed to register the bathroom door opening…or several garments and a pair of neural adapters hitting the floor…or the shower's glass door opening and then closing again.  
第三适格者这天如此专注于不愉快的天气和淋浴的缓解效果，以至于他没有注意到浴室门的开启……或是几件衣物和一对神经适配器落在地上……或是淋浴间的玻璃门打开又关上。

What he DID notice was two hands curl around his body just above his waist as teeth softly nibbled at his left earlobe followed by sweet German words he had grown to love over the past several months.  
他确实注意到的是，两只手在他腰间上方环绕，牙齿轻轻咬住他的左耳垂，随后是过去几个月里他逐渐爱上的甜蜜德语。

"_Hallo mein leibling…"_ Asuka whispered into Shinji's ear as she wound her arms tighter around his body and pressed her breasts against his back. Despite the temperature of the shower's water, Shinji felt goosebumps spread across his body at Asuka's presence.  
"亲爱的宝贝……" 明日香对着真嗣的耳朵低语，双臂更紧地环绕着他的身体，将胸部贴在他的背上。尽管淋浴的水温很高，真嗣还是感觉到明日香的靠近让他的身体泛起了鸡皮疙瘩。

"You ought to be more careful Asuka, what if Misato sees us like this?" Shinji asked his roommate and lover.  
"你该更小心些，明日香，万一美里看到我们这样怎么办？" 真嗣问他的室友兼恋人。

"She just left a message on the answering machine. NERV has some project that needs doing so she's pulling a double shift and then taking a two day break starting tomorrow morning." Asuka said as she turned Shinji around so they were facing each other. Shinji saw Asuka's mischievous grin as she continued "So I've got you all to myself." Asuka finished as the two pilots looked deep into the blue of each other's eyes. Shinji's eyes inevitably dropped to take in Asuka's gorgeous body. Glistening breasts that had filled out so they were on the cusp of going from B to C cups. Water flowing down onto a stomach and body toned by a lifetime of training. Long legs and arms, that while fit were not overly muscular and retained their femininity. And between those legs, the object of his desires drew his cobalt eyes towards her perfectly clean and shaven mound. "My eyes are up here baka." Asuka playfully scolded as she saw Shinji's gaze wander.  
"她刚在答录机上留了言。NERV 有个项目需要处理，所以她要连上两班，然后从明天早上开始休息两天。" 明日香说着将真嗣转过来，让他们面对面。真嗣看到明日香调皮的笑容，她继续说道："所以我可以独占你了。" 两位驾驶员深深凝视着彼此的蓝眼睛。真嗣的目光不由自主地落在了明日香迷人的身躯上。闪耀的胸部已经丰满到即将从 B 罩杯升级到 C 罩杯的边缘。水流顺着她因长期训练而紧致的腹部和身体流下。修长的双腿和手臂，虽然结实但不过于肌肉发达，保留了女性的柔美。而在那双腿之间，他渴望的目标将他深蓝的目光引向她那完美无瑕、剃得干干净净的私密处。"我的眼睛在这儿，笨蛋。" 明日香看到真嗣的目光游移，俏皮地责备道。

"Sorry." Shinji said reflexively.  
"对不起。" 真嗣本能地回答道。

"You're never going to learn are you baka?" Asuka said as she playfully pinched his ear. In the several months they had been together she had tried to rid him of habits she considered bad or annoying. Though as the pinch turned into an open palm upon Shinji's cheek Asuka realized that street ran two ways.  
"你永远都学不会，是不是笨蛋？" 明日香一边说着，一边俏皮地捏了捏他的耳朵。自从他们在一起的几个月里，她一直试图帮他改掉那些她认为不好或烦人的习惯。然而，当捏耳朵变成手掌轻拍在真嗣的脸颊上时，明日香意识到这条街是双向的。

They stood there under the water for a moment, soft smiles on both their lips as they contemplated what the other meant to them and how they had grown since that fateful day in the weeks after the ill-fated mission to Mt. Asama. The feelings of ennui and worthlessness that had plagued Shinji's psyche for so long had become tiny whispers in the back of his skull with Asuka in his life. Likewise Asuka's own self-confidence and feelings of self-worth had improved throughout their relationship as she had realized that Shinji's sincerity was not because she was the Second Child and a pilot. But instead simply because she was Asuka Langley Sorhyu and that was more precious than anything.  
他们站在水下片刻，两人的唇边都带着淡淡的微笑，思考着对方对他们意味着什么，以及自从那次不幸的飞往浅间山的任务后几周内的那个决定性日子以来，他们是如何成长的。长期以来困扰着真嗣心灵的厌倦感和无价值感，在有明日香的生活中变成了他脑海中微弱的低语。同样，随着他们关系的发展，明日香的自信心和自我价值感也得到了提升，她意识到真嗣的真诚不是因为她作为第二适格者和驾驶员的身份。而是因为她就是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，这比任何东西都要珍贵。

Their faces drew together and they shared a passionate kiss as their chests pressed together and Shinji's hands ran down to Asuka's back and down to her waist while Asuka's own arms both went around Shinji's neck. Their teeth separated and both their tongues met and had a light quest for dominance in their mouths. After some time their lips parted and they stood their holding onto each other.  
他们的脸庞紧贴在一起，共享了一个充满激情的吻，胸膛相贴，真嗣的双手从明日香的背后滑至她的腰间，而明日香的双臂则环绕在真嗣的脖颈上。他们的牙齿分开，两人的舌头相遇，在口中轻轻地争夺着主导权。片刻后，他们的唇瓣分开，彼此紧握着对方站在那里。

"You seemed really out of it before I came in, anything wrong?" Asuka asked as she played with the spikes Shinji's hair became when it got wet.  
“你刚才看起来心不在焉的，有什么事吗？”明日香问道，同时拨弄着真嗣湿发时形成的那些发梢。

"Nothing, just this heatwave, combined with the coach's deluded notion we need to run in it."  
“没什么，只是这热浪，再加上教练那荒谬的想法，认为我们得在这种天气里跑步。”

"Tell me about it." The redhead retorted. "It's a wonder no one got heat stroke today. You'd think NERV woulda put a stop to it out of fear for our piloting ability." Asuka remarked in a bombastic tone but laced with more softness than usual as it was just them to hear.  
"说来话长。" 红发少女反驳道。"今天没人中暑真是奇迹。你以为 NERV 会出于对我们驾驶能力的担忧而叫停这一切。" 明日香用一种夸张的语气说道，但比起平时多了几分柔和，毕竟只有他们俩能听到。

"Maybe. Or maybe they just don't really care about us at all." Shinji said as his eyes looked down and his hand slowly started clenching and unclenching at his side. 'They were just going to let her die.'  
"也许吧。或者他们根本就不在乎我们。" 真嗣说道，他的目光低垂，手慢慢地在身侧握紧又松开。'他们就那样让她去死。'

"Hey don't do that! I know that's your tic for feeling anxious." Asuka said as she brought Shinji's face back up with a soft touch of her fingers and looked in his eyes before continuing. "We agreed that if they didn't give a damn then neither would we. Just you and me, that's enough." Asuka said with a soft smile no one at school or NERV would believe was possible from the self-proclaimed Great Asuka Langley Sorhyu.  
"嘿，别这样！我知道这是你感到焦虑时的习惯动作。" 明日香说着，用手指轻轻托起真嗣的脸，直视他的眼睛，然后继续说道。"我们说好了，如果他们不在乎，那我们也不在乎。只要有你和我，就足够了。" 明日香带着一个温柔的微笑说道，这是学校或 NERV 里无人相信自称为伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷会露出的笑容。

Shinji responded with a weak smile of his own but the German redhead wasn't convinced.  
真嗣回以一个微弱的微笑，但那位德国红发少女并不信服。

'This calls for drastic measures.' she thought as she eyed her strawberry shower gel on the rack in the corner of the shower.  
'这得采取非常手段。'她心想，目光落在角落淋浴架上的草莓味沐浴露上。

"It was so hot today," Asuka started in her playful voice that up until several months ago meant she was teasing Shinji "I sweated so much and got so dirty." She continued as she reached over Shinji and grabbed the shower gel bottle. "Could you help me wash my dirty body, Shinji." Asuka finished in the most seductive voice she had as she squirted far more of the strawberry scented gel than was necessary down onto her breasts.  
“今天真是热啊，”明日香用她那直到几个月前还意味着在捉弄真嗣的俏皮声音说道，“我出了好多汗，弄得浑身脏兮兮的。”她一边说，一边越过真嗣，伸手去拿沐浴露瓶子。“你能帮我洗洗这脏兮兮的身体吗，真嗣。”明日香用她最撩人的声音说完，挤出了远超所需的草莓香味的沐浴露，滴落在她的胸前。

Hormones are a great cure for depression and angst.  
荷尔蒙是治疗抑郁和焦虑的良药。

Shinji forgot about his momentary relapse into his old habits and way of thinking and began to use his hands as Asuka intended until the red gel became red-tinted bubbles that filled the shower with their scent as he lathered them all over Asuka's chest. Squeezing Asuka's breasts Shinji kneaded them together and slowly began to spread the soap around to the rest of Asuka's perfect body.  
真嗣忘记了短暂重拾的旧习惯和思维方式，开始按照明日香的意思用手涂抹着红色凝胶，直到它变成染红的泡沫，充满了淋浴间的香气，覆盖在明日香的胸前。他揉捏着明日香的乳房，将它们合在一起，慢慢地将肥皂涂抹到她完美身体的其他部位。

Shinji's hands made their way to Asuka's shoulders and then down her arms before going to Asuka's back, inadvertently bringing them closer together as Shinji's fingers went further down towards the redhead's waist. He slowly got to his knees as his hands made their way to and past his lover's posterior. They took a large handful of her ass as they went, squeezing the fleshy mounds before moving on to her legs. Shinji felt every muscle as he went, and he especially felt the little tingle that caused Asuka to jump a little as he lathered her inner thigh.  
真嗣的手从明日香的肩膀滑向她的手臂，然后移到她的背部，不经意间让两人更加贴近，随着他的手指向下探向红发少女的腰际。他缓缓跪下，双手摸索着并越过了爱人的臀部。他们抓了一大把她的臀部，捏了捏那肉感的隆起，然后继续向下移动到她的双腿。真嗣在涂抹过程中感受到了每一块肌肉，特别是那种让明日香微微一跳的微妙刺痛感，当他涂抹她的大腿内侧时。

From his position Shinji had a good view of Asuka's pussy. The pink folds of her inner labia were just visible, as was her clitoris poking through. Still on his knees he switched positions so that Asuka was now under the shower head which began to wash off the along with all the stress and cares that Asuka had Her red hair became a shade darker as it got wet and began to cling to her flesh. Her bust had several strands of hair clinging to it, just the right amount to look unbelievably erotic, but not cover any of the good stuff.  
从他的位置，真嗣可以清楚地看到明日香的下体。她粉红色的内阴唇微微可见，阴蒂也隐约露出。他仍然跪着，调整了位置，让明日香处于淋浴头下，水流开始冲刷掉一切，连同明日香所有的压力和烦恼。她的红发因湿润而颜色加深，开始紧贴着她的肌肤。她的胸部有几缕发丝缠绕，恰到好处地增添了无比的诱惑，却没有遮住任何关键部位。

Shinji couldn't really restrain himself anymore, he brought his face to Asuka's mound and began slowly starting to lick her labia and ever so slightly probing her entrance with his tongue.  
真嗣再也控制不住自己，他将脸贴近明日香的阴阜，开始缓缓地舔舐她的阴唇，并用舌头轻轻探入她的入口。

"Ahh, yes _leibing._" Asuka said as she spread her legs to give Shinji more room to work with. Shinji, unsatisfied with this just picked up Asuka's right leg and put it over his shoulder so that Asuka's pussy was spread out before him in all of its glory. He then proceeded to work his tongue over her entrance, making circles around her opening with his tongue and kissing her inner thigh. Asuka's response was one of soft moans and grabbing Shinji's hair with her hands. Shinji also absently thought he heard Asuka say 'tickles' at some point but couldn't be sure.  
“啊，没错，丽冰。”明日香说着，张开双腿为真嗣腾出更多空间。真嗣对此并不满足，他抬起明日香的右腿搭在自己肩上，使得明日香的私处完全展现在他眼前。接着，他用舌头在她入口处游走，用舌尖围绕着她的开口画圈，并亲吻她的内大腿。明日香的反应是轻声呻吟，双手紧抓着真嗣的头发。真嗣隐约觉得明日香在某一刻说了声“好痒”，但并不确定。

Soon Shinji began probing her entrance with his fingers. First one, then two, and began his stroking. He probed for the parts that felt like wrinkled fingers did after spending too much time in water. Supposedly according to some rather…questionable looking sites those were the most areas of a girl's vagina. After finding what he was looking for Shinji began to work, moving his fingers slowly and gently at first. He didn't want a repeat of the first time they had tried this. Meanwhile his tongue still worked in the area of Asuka's clitoris, making circles around and ever so slightly touching the sensitive bud of Asuka's womanhood.  
很快，真嗣开始用手指探寻她的入口。先是单指，随后是双指，开始轻柔地抚弄。他寻找着那些因长时间浸泡在水中而显得皱巴巴的部位，据某些看起来颇为可疑的网站所说，这些地方是女性阴道中最敏感的区域。找到目标后，真嗣开始动作，起初手指移动得缓慢而温柔，他不想重蹈他们第一次尝试时的覆辙。与此同时，他的舌头仍在继续在明日香阴蒂周围打转，轻轻触碰着她女性私密处的敏感花蕾。

Asuka squeezed her own breasts as Shinji worked with his tongue and fingers. She felt as if her insides were on fire as she was rapidly building to the crescendo of her own orgasm. She was so close. Just a little more. Then Shinji's tongue rapidly moved back and forth across her clit and pushed her over the edge. Her entire body shook and trembled at the intensity of her orgasm as she took deep breaths into her heaving lungs.  
随着真嗣用舌头和手指的辛勤工作，明日香紧握着自己的双乳。她感觉自己的体内仿佛燃起了熊熊烈火，迅速逼近高潮的顶峰。她已经如此接近，只差一点点。就在这时，真嗣的舌头在她阴蒂上快速来回扫动，将她彻底推过了极限。她的整个身体因高潮的强烈冲击而颤抖不已，深深地呼吸着，胸膛随之剧烈起伏。

When Asuka had come down from this state of blissful pleasure, Shinji got up from his kneeling position and embraced her. They shared a fiery series of kisses before Asuka broke away. She had noticed during their make-out session that a certain part of Shinji's biology was standing at attention.  
当明日香从这种极乐的快感中回过神来时，真嗣从跪姿中起身，拥抱着她。他们交换了一连串炽热的吻，直到明日香挣脱开来。在她与真嗣的亲热过程中，她注意到真嗣身体的一部分正昂首挺立。

"Now it's my turn." She said as she moved Shinji under the stream of water and got on her knees before Shinji's rock hard erection. If they hadn't been in the shower with the water obscuring everything Asuka would have noticed the gleaming pre-cum on the tip of Shinji's manhood.  
“现在轮到我了。”她说着，将真嗣移到水流下，自己则跪在他坚挺的勃起前。如果不是在淋浴间，水流遮掩了一切，明日香本会注意到真嗣的顶端闪烁着光泽的前液。

Asuka took Shinji's cock in her hand and began to kiss up and down his shaft while her other hand began to slowly fondle his balls that were already close to bursting. Then she made her way to the tip and after kissing it, she parted her lips and put the head of Shinji's dick into her mouth swirling her tongue around it and sucking on it. She then proceeded to take more of his shaft into her mouth, moving her tongue around the shaft and not neglecting his balls as she went further and further down.  
明日香握住真嗣的阴茎，开始沿着他的肉棒上下亲吻，而她的另一只手则缓缓抚弄着他那几乎要爆裂的睾丸。随后，她移向顶端，亲吻之后，她张开嘴唇，将真嗣的龟头含入口中，用舌头环绕舔舐并吮吸。接着，她继续将更多的肉棒纳入口中，舌头环绕着棒身，同时也不忘照顾他的睾丸，逐渐深入。

Shinji for his part was in heaven. He placed his hands on her head, guiding her as her head bobbed up and down on his member, going deeper each time. He could hear the slurping sounds Asuka's mouth was making even over the pattering of the water I the shower. After some time he heard something else though.  
对于真嗣来说，此刻的他仿佛置身天堂。他将双手放在她的头上，引导着她上下起伏，每一次都更深入地吞吐着他的那物。即便在淋浴的水声中，他仍能清晰地听到明日香口中发出的吸吮声。然而，过了一会儿，他听到了别的声音。

"Asuka, you don't have to get all the way." Shinji said as he heard her begin to gag as she got three-quarters down the length of his shaft. She had given Shinji head many other times before this and in all of them she had never been able to get past the three-quarter mark of his shaft and take his full manhood into her mouth.  
“明日香，你不必勉强自己全部吞下。”真嗣说道，他听到她开始呛咳，因为她已经吞下了他那物的四分之三。尽管之前明日香已经多次为真嗣口交，但每次她都无法突破四分之三的界限，将他的全部纳入口中。

'Like hell I'm going to stop. Today's the day dammit.' She thought as her mouth was rather occupied at the moment. Asuka removed her hands from Shinji's groin and placed them on his legs for support, opened her mouth as wide as it would go, and doggedly, choking and gagging, made her way down.  
“我才不会就此罢休。今天我一定要做到。”她心想，尽管此刻她的嘴正忙得不可开交。明日香将原本放在真嗣腹股沟的双手移到他的腿上以作支撑，尽可能地张大嘴巴，坚定地、一边呛咳一边努力地向下吞咽。

'She never lost her die-hard determination did she?' Shinji thought as he felt Asuka's lips reach his balls and her mouth open slightly to let her tongue escape slightly to play with the wrinkles on his sack.  
'她从未失去那股顽强的决心，不是吗？' 真嗣想着，感觉到明日香的唇触碰到了他的睾丸，她的嘴微微张开，让舌头稍稍伸出，轻轻挑逗着他阴囊上的皱褶。

Shinji couldn't hold back any longer, the pressure in his balls demanded release and the feeling of his cock all the way in Asuka's throat was just too much. His hands held Asuka's head in place as ropes of cum shot down her throat. Neither could tell just how many spurts there were, but it had to have been at least three or four perhaps more. Having released his seed, Shinji also loosened his grip on the fiery redhead and she pulled away, gulping down mouthfuls of air in ragged breaths. Her breasts rising and falling with each furtive intake of precious air. She could taste a small bit of the semen that hadn't gone straight down her throat and gave an extra swallow for good measure. It was far from the first time he had cum in her mouth but he usually gave her a bit of warning, but this time she let it slide, so proud of herself she was.  
真嗣再也忍不住了，他下体的压力要求释放，而他的阴茎完全深入明日香喉咙的感觉实在太强烈了。他的双手固定住明日香的头，一连串的精液射入她的喉咙。两人都无法确切说出有多少次喷射，但至少有三到四次，或许更多。释放了精液后，真嗣也放松了对这位火红发少女的抓握，她退开，急促地大口喘息。她的胸部随着每一次急切的呼吸而起伏。她能尝到一点没有直接流入喉咙的精液，又多咽了一口以确保。虽然这不是他第一次在她嘴里射精，但他通常会提前给她一些警告，但这次她放过了他，她对自己感到如此自豪。

"I did it, I finally fucking did it," Asuka proclaimed still short of breath.  
“我做到了，我他妈的终于做到了，”明日香喘着气宣布道。

"Yeah," Shinji said before continuing "sorry I didn't warn you, it was just so sudden." Asuka just nodded as she stood up and embraced Shinji, sharing soft kisses as the soothing water washed over them. As oxygen slowly returned to Asuka's brain she became aware of something hard and throbbing on her thigh.  
“嗯，”真嗣说道，接着继续，“抱歉没提前告诉你，事情发生得太突然了。”明日香只是点点头，站起身来拥抱真嗣，两人共享着温柔的亲吻，舒缓的水流冲刷着他们。随着氧气慢慢回到明日香的大脑，她意识到自己大腿上有个坚硬且跳动的东西。

"You're still hard?" Asuka said as she felt Shinji's cock slide its way into the space between her thighs so that it rubbed on her pussy's lips.  
“你还是硬着的？”明日香说道，感觉到真嗣的阴茎滑入她大腿之间的空隙，摩擦着她的阴唇。

"Mhm." Shinji replied laconically.  
“嗯。”真嗣简短地回应道。

'Real sexy there baka' Asuka thought to herself. 'Still…' Asuka's mind continued, decision already made and wheels already in motion in her mind. Asuka then turned around hands pressed against the glass of the shower for support as she bent over and placed herself before Shinji.  
“真是个笨蛋，还挺性感。”明日香暗自想着。“不过……”明日香的心思已定，脑海中的计划已经开始运转。她随即转身，双手撑在淋浴间的玻璃上作为支撑，弯下腰将自己置于真嗣面前。

"Does your pencil need a sharpener?" She said, using their code phrase for a quickie at school, as she wiggled her ass invitingly.  
“你的铅笔需要削尖吗？”她用他们在学校里暗指快速亲热的暗语说道，同时扭动着臀部，发出诱人的邀请。

Shinji wasted no time and positioned the tip of his member at the entrance of Asuka's womanhood and prepared to enter her. Going in gently with just the cockhead first he then grabbed hold of Asuka's waist just above her ass with both hands and began to slide in slowly.  
真嗣毫不犹豫地将他的阴茎尖端对准明日香阴道的入口，准备进入。他先是轻轻地只用龟头探入，然后双手抓住明日香腰间靠近臀部的地方，缓缓地滑入。

Until eventually Asuka felt the wrinkles on his balls brushing against her clit as he hilted his full length into her. Asuka felt a tingle like lighting shooting through her body at the contact with her most sensitive part. As it faded Asuka became aware of the feeling of fullness now that Shinji's member was fully inside of her.  
直到最终，真嗣的阴囊上的皱纹触碰到了明日香的阴蒂，他完全插入了她。明日香感受到一股如电击般的颤栗贯穿全身，与她最敏感的部位接触。当这感觉消退时，明日香意识到真嗣的阴茎完全在她体内所带来的充实感。

'It just feels so right' Asuka thought.  
'这种感觉如此正确' 明日香心想。

Shinji's thoughts were equally of bliss as he felt Asuka's warm insides squeeze at his rock-hard erection. They stood like that for a moment taking in the feeling of being united once again as the water from the shower head impacted Shinji's back. Slowly Shinji started to withdraw his cock from Asuka's pussy, going until half of his length was out before sliding it back into her wet hole. After the third trip he heard a soft moan escape Asuka's lips and decided to pick up the pace of his movements. Asuka responded with more moans and German words that Shinji couldn't quite make out. His motions and the flowing water combined to fill the bathroom with the sound of wet fleshy bodies slapping against each other.  
真嗣的思绪同样充满了极乐，他感受到明日香温暖的体内紧握着他坚硬的勃起。他们就这样站了一会儿，感受着再次结合的感觉，淋浴头的水流冲击着真嗣的背部。慢慢地，真嗣开始从明日香的阴道中抽出他的阴茎，直到一半的长度露出，然后又滑回她湿润的洞穴。第三次之后，他听到明日香发出一声轻柔的呻吟，决定加快动作的节奏。明日香以更多的呻吟和真嗣听不太懂的德语回应。他的动作和流动的水共同填满了浴室，回荡着湿润肉体相互拍打的声音。

As Shinji lifted his gaze from Asuka's ample ass he saw the bathroom mirror. In it he could see clearly, despite the steam from the shower, how Asuka's breasts were pressed against the glass of the shower door, and how they moved with each of his thrusts. But even more of a turn-on for Shinji was the look he saw on Asuka's face. That wanting, that animalistic need in her eyes to get fucked.  
当真嗣从明日香丰满的臀部抬起视线时，他看到了浴室镜子。尽管淋浴的蒸汽弥漫，他仍能清晰地看到明日香的胸部紧贴着淋浴门的玻璃，以及随着他的每一次挺进而晃动。但对真嗣来说，更让他兴奋的是他在明日香脸上看到的表情。那种渴望，那种野性的需求，她的眼神中透露出对被占有的渴望。

Shinji's thrust became faster as the longing in her eyes spurred him on as much as the sensation of her pussy tightening around his cock as she neared her own release. Her body quivered and the walls of her pussy clenched around Shinji's dick, refusing to let it go.  
随着她眼中渴望的加深，真嗣的冲刺变得更加迅猛，这种渴望与她即将达到高潮时阴道紧缩围绕他阴茎的感觉同样刺激着他。她的身体颤抖着，阴道的壁垒紧握着真嗣的阴茎，不愿放开。

"Ohhh Ffffuuck!" She cried out as she came around his cock.  
“哦，操！”她围绕着他的阴茎尖叫着达到了高潮。

"Ohh God, Asuka, I-I-I…" Shinji said with only a semblance of coherence as he also came. Wave after wave of semen shot into Asuka's wet and waiting hole. She could feel his hot, sticky load on the walls of her pussy. She loved the feeling of having cum inside of her. It was cathartic still even after all the times they did. To know there was an entire other person there. To know that he found her attractive, that she could make him cum, that she could make him give a piece of himself to her.  
"哦，天哪，明日香，我……" 真嗣结结巴巴地说着，也达到了高潮。一波又一波的精液射入了明日香湿润而渴望的小穴。她能感觉到他滚烫、粘稠的精液在她私处的内壁上。她喜欢这种体内有精液的感觉。即便经历了这么多次，这种感觉依然具有宣泄作用。知道那里有另一个人存在，知道他觉得她有吸引力，知道她能让他射精，知道她能让他把一部分自己交给她。

After a moment Shinji began to move his cock ever so slowly inide Asuka, helping her come down from her high before finally withdrawing his member from her. As his dick left there was a thin strand of semen that stretched from her pussy before being torn apart by a stray water droplet.  
过了一会儿，真嗣开始在明日香体内缓慢地移动他的阴茎，帮助她从高潮中平复下来，最后才从她体内抽出。当他的阴茎离开时，有一条细长的精液从她的私处延伸出来，随后被一滴偶然的水珠扯断。

It was at times like these that Shinji was glad that Asuka was on the pill. 'I really ought to do something nice for Hikari to thank her for that.' Shinji thought. It had honestly surprised him when Asuka had told him about it. Being a pilot Asuka couldn't exactly go and get birth control pills herself, that would raise…questions. Hikari was Asuka's closest friend and the only one really she could request something like this.  
每当这种时候，真嗣都会庆幸明日香在服用避孕药。'我真的应该为光做点什么来感谢她。' 真嗣心想。明日香告诉他这件事时，他确实感到惊讶。作为驾驶员，明日香不能自己去买避孕药，那样会引起……疑问。光是明日香最亲密的朋友，也是唯一一个她能请求这种事情的人。

Based on what Asuka had told him Hikari had asked, "Is it Shinji?". Asuka had merely nodded in response before Hikari had turned away and left. The next day as Asuka was changing into her gym clothes she had found the pills in her locker along with their prescription to "Horaki. H" for "Severe Menstrual Cramps". They were of course worried that Section 2 or NERV would catch on but considering it took those shady creeps _**days**_ to find their _**only**_ combat capable pilot they probably weren't snooping around enough to figure it out. That or they just didn't care, but neither pilot wanted to test that hypothesis.  
根据明日香的描述，光曾问过，“是真嗣吗？” 明日香只是点头回应，随后光便转身离开。第二天，明日香在换上体育服时，在她的储物柜里发现了那些药片，还有一张处方，上面写着“Horaki. H”，诊断为“严重痛经”。他们当然担心第二课或 NERV 会发现，但考虑到那些阴暗的家伙需要几天时间才能找到他们唯一的战斗能力驾驶员，他们可能没有足够的时间来调查这件事。或者他们根本就不在乎，但两位驾驶员都不想验证这个假设。

"Looks like he is satisfied for now" Asuka said breaking Shinji out of his reverie and drawing attention to his now calm member. "Let's get you cleaned up" Asuka said grabbing some soap that she then lathered over Shinji's groin, washing away the juices from their love-making that had begun to harden despite the shower's humidity and moisture.  
“看来他现在满意了。”明日香说道，打断了真嗣的沉思，并让他的注意力转移到他现在平静的部位。“我们帮你清理一下。”明日香说着，拿起一块肥皂，在真嗣的腹股沟上搓出泡沫，洗去了他们欢爱后开始变硬但仍受淋浴湿气和水分影响的体液。

'Lavender' Shinji thought as the smell of the suds made their way to his nose. He took the soap from Asuka's hands and began to wash her body as well until it was covered in the mildly fragrant and relaxing soap. As he finished lathering on the soap their eyes met each other. They didn't need words, Shinji's arms merely went around her waist again as Asuka's head rested on his chest.  
‘薰衣草味。’真嗣心想，泡沫的香气飘到了他的鼻尖。他从明日香手中接过肥皂，开始为她清洗身体，直到她的全身都被这温和芳香、令人放松的肥皂覆盖。当他完成涂抹肥皂时，他们的目光相遇了。无需言语，真嗣的手臂再次环抱住她的腰，明日香的头靠在他的胸前。

'How did I live without this?' She thought as she managed to listen to his heart beating over the pattering sounds of the shower.  
‘没有这些，我是怎么活过来的？’她想着，尽力在淋浴的哗哗声中聆听他的心跳。

Their soapy bodies where pressed against each other in a subdued yet nonetheless passionate embrace when a sudden burst of cold water told them that they had outstayed their welcome under the showerhead. They both quickly and gracelessly washed off the remaining soap from their bodies while frantically cursing under their breath at the audacity of the hot water to simply be _**gone**_.  
他们泡沫覆盖的身体在柔和却依旧充满激情的拥抱中紧贴在一起，突然一股冷水袭来，告诉他们已在花洒下逗留过久。两人迅速且笨拙地冲洗掉身上的残余泡沫，同时低声咒骂热水竟敢就这样消失。

Quickly shutting off the now frigid water they stepped out of the shower and grabbed their towels. Asuka finished drying herself off first and went towards the door.  
他们迅速关掉现在冰冷的水，走出淋浴间，抓起毛巾。明日香率先擦干自己，走向门口。

"Hey whhha-" Shinji stammered as Asuka opened the bathroom door and had begun to walk out into the apartment with nothing but the grin on her face.  
“嘿，什——” 真嗣结巴着，明日香已打开浴室门，脸上挂着得意的笑容，赤裸地走进公寓。

"Did you forget baka," Asuka said as she turned around before continuing in a sultry voice "Misato is gone until tomorrow so that means I have the apartment and you all to myself." She finished as her hands went to his groin and fondled what was hers.  
“你忘了傻瓜，”明日香转过身来，用撩人的声音继续说道，“美里要到明天才回来，这意味着整个公寓和我都是你的。”她一边说，手一边伸向他的下体，抚弄着属于她的那部分。

'It's going to be one of those nights isn't it…" Shinji thought as he followed her out of the shower and onto their next erotic adventure.  
“今晚注定是那样的夜晚，不是吗…”真嗣想着，跟着她走出浴室，开始了他们下一场激情冒险。

**A/N:** So I wrote this story for two reasons. One I wanted to try my hand at writing lemons, and second I'm a fan of reading Asushin stories, both lemon and non and in all this time I have never found an AxS lemon that has shower sex. So I made one. Are they OOC? Maybe but hey it's a Lemon.  
作者注：我写这个故事有两个原因。一是我想尝试写柠檬文，二是我是 Asushin 故事的爱好者，无论是柠檬文还是非柠檬文，但在这么长时间里，我从未找到过有浴室性爱的 AxS 柠檬文。所以我创作了一篇。他们是否有些 OOC？也许吧，但嘿，这是一篇柠檬文。

### Chapter 2 One of Those Nights

The Great Asuka Langley Sohryu walked through the apartment that she shared with a functioning alcoholic, a somewhat smaller and less human functioning alcoholic, and her taciturn doormat.  
伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷穿过她与一个功能性酗酒者、一个稍小且不那么像人的功能性酗酒者以及她那沉默的出气筒共同居住的公寓。

'No, that's not right.' She thought. Correcting the first impressions she had had of him when they met in the Pacific all that time ago. 'He's so much stronger than that. He just never had anything he cared about protecting with it.' She ruminated as she continued her sweep through the apartment.  
“不，这样不对。”她想，纠正着很久以前在太平洋初次见面时对他的第一印象。“他比那要强大得多。只是他从没有什么在乎到需要用这份力量去保护的东西。”她一边沉思，一边继续在公寓里巡视。

Having checked the last window and making sure it was shut to all prying eyes she let the towel covering her body fall to the floor where it landed with a soft thump.  
检查完最后一扇窗户并确保它已关闭，不让任何窥探的目光进入后，她让裹在身上的毛巾落到地板上，发出一声轻柔的闷响。

"Freedom." She let out with a glad sigh as she felt the joy of not being constrained, by her pilot status, by school, by society…by clothes, just being able to be herself. To just be Asuka. For the redhead who had so long defined herself by what others thought it was liberating to just not give a fuck.  
“自由。”她带着轻松的叹息说道，感受到不受飞行员身份、学校、社会……甚至衣物的束缚，只是做回自己，做回明日香的那份喜悦。对于长期以来一直以他人看法定义自己的红发少女来说，这种无所顾忌的感觉真是解放。

With Misato gone at NERV working on some project or whatever they had the apartment to themselves and after the stifling hot day at school and their steamy escapades in the shower Shinji had decided to get to work on preparing dinner.  
美里去 NERV 忙某个项目或别的什么了，公寓里只剩下他们俩。在经历了学校里闷热的一天和浴室里的激情后，真嗣决定开始准备晚餐。

Asuka was broken out of her reverie by sounds emanating from said kitchen. Running water and the tell-tale scrape of vegetables being peeled. Asuka clad in nothing but her neural adapters went into the kitchen. There she saw Shinji dressed in a plain white T-shirt and blue boxers with his back to her as he faced the sink. So of course she snuck up on him.  
厨房传来的声音打断了明日香的沉思。水流声和剥菜皮的熟悉声响。只穿着神经适配器的明日香走进厨房，看到真嗣背对着她，穿着简单的白色 T 恤和蓝色短裤，面向水槽。于是她自然地悄悄靠近了他。

"What's for dinner _leibling_?" Asuka purred into Shinji's ear as she came up behind him and pressed her body onto Shinji's back gleefully hoping to give him goosebumps again.  
"今晚吃什么呢，小宝贝？" 明日香在他耳边轻声细语，从背后贴上他的身体，愉快地希望再次让他起鸡皮疙瘩。

"Fried potatoes and carrots with Bratwursts." Shinji said rather proudly as he placed the last of the peeled vegetables on the cutting block and began cutting them into cubes as Asuka made circles with her fingers on his shoulder-blades  
"炸土豆和胡萝卜配德国香肠。" 真嗣颇为自豪地说道，将最后一些削好的蔬菜放在切菜板上，开始切成方块，而明日香则用手指在他肩胛骨上画圈。

"Are they the good ones?" Asuka asked remembering the first "Bratwursts" Shinji had brought home from the store. They had had the texture of paper and contained spices that tasted like they had been chosen by Misato.  
"是好的那种吗？" 明日香问道，想起了真嗣第一次从店里带回家的"德国香肠"。那些香肠口感像纸一样，而且调料的味道像是被美里挑选的。

"Of course." Shinji responded remembering that _exceedingly_ unpleasant experience.  
"当然。" 真嗣回应道，回想起那次极其不愉快的经历。

"Mmmm." Asuka was delighted as her hands reached under his shirt to touch his admittedly flat chest with barely any musculature. 'Well we're getting there.' As Asuka thought about their pilot training's impact on his physique. "Yum. We have any sauerkraut?"  
"嗯嗯。" 明日香欣喜地伸手探入他的衬衫，触摸他那确实平坦、肌肉并不明显的胸膛。'我们正在进步。' 明日香想着他们的驾驶员训练对他的体型的影响。"好吃。我们有酸菜吗？"

"No, I couldn't find any sauerkraut at the store, but we have kimchi, which is basically the same thing." Big mistake there Shinji.  
"没有，我在店里没找到酸菜，但我们有泡菜，基本上是一样的东西。" 真嗣在这里犯了个大错。

"Baka! No they aren't." Asuka responded indignantly and removing her hands from his body to stand with them on her hips, evidently displeased. "_Sauerkraut_" Asuka continued putting heavy stress on her proper German pronunciation "is made from different cabbage and has a subtle flavor given to it by it's unique…"  
"笨蛋！才不是呢。" 明日香愤愤不平地回应，双手从他身上移开，叉腰站立，显然很不高兴。"酸菜" 明日香继续强调她标准的德语发音，"是用不同的卷心菜制成的，它的独特风味来自于其特有的……"

"Wark!" Asuka's tirade on the difference between types of pickled cabbages was interrupted by a hungry warm water penguin. Both Shinji and Asuka turned in unison to stare at Pen Pen as he looked expectantly before releasing another, more insistent it seemed, "Wark!"  
"哇克！" 明日香关于腌制卷心菜种类差异的长篇大论被一只饥饿的温水企鹅打断了。真嗣和明日香齐刷刷地转头盯着 Pen Pen，它期待地看着他们，然后似乎更加急切地又发出了一声，"哇克！"

"Oh you must be hungry Pen Pen here let me get your sardines." Shinji said, his words full of contrition.  
"哦，你一定是饿了，Pen Pen，让我给你拿沙丁鱼。" 真嗣说道，语气中充满了歉意。

"No don't give him a thing yet, we still haven't had our dinner yet!" Asuka said as she turned towards Pen Pen and bent over at her waist in order to look into Pen Pen's eyes so she could give the barely, if at all, sapient bird a firm talking to.  
“不，现在别给他任何东西，我们还没吃晚饭呢！”明日香说着转向 Pen Pen，弯腰俯身，直视着这只几乎（如果有的话）没有智慧的鸟，严肃地对它说教。

Asuka spoke of the difference between humans and pets, animals and people, the human spirit and other high ideals with fancy sounding words. Shinji heard none of it. His focus was on a different set of lips. Because of the way Asuka had bent over she had given Shinji a perfect view of her slit, the outer lips pressed together so there is just barely a hint of her opening. With labia the same creamy white of Asuka's skin surrounded by her round and inviting ass shaking as she wildly gesticulated at the ever more fearful bird.  
明日香用华丽的辞藻谈论着人与宠物、动物与人、人类精神与其他高尚理想之间的区别。真嗣对此充耳不闻。他的注意力集中在另一组唇上。由于明日香弯腰的姿势，她给了真嗣一个完美的视角，看到她的裂缝，外唇紧贴在一起，只隐约可见她的开口。围绕着她那圆润诱人的臀部，随着她对那只越来越害怕的鸟激烈地比划，她的阴唇与明日香的皮肤一样奶白色。

Shinji stood there mouth gaping, thoughts unable to form properly, as all the blood flooded into his other head, now straining at the hole in the front of his boxers.  
真嗣站在那里，嘴巴张开，思绪无法正常形成，因为所有的血液都涌向了他的另一个头，现在正紧绷着穿过他短裤前方的洞。

"Isn't that right Shinji?" Asuka asked turning to Shinji for support just as Shinji's rock hard erection popped out of the opening in his boxers. Asuka stood there, seemingly mesmerized by the cock as it slowly stopped wagging back and forth from the built up spring-like force of being constrained.  
"对吧，真嗣？" 明日香转向真嗣寻求支持，就在这时，真嗣那坚硬如石的勃起从他的内裤开口处弹了出来。明日香站在那里，似乎被那根阴茎迷住了，它慢慢地停止了因被束缚而产生的弹簧般的摆动。

Eventually the redhead regained enough of her senses to feel embarrassed and let out a yelp that sent Pen Pen scurrying back to his cooler, sardines forgotten. The yelp soon turned into a blush that turned her face the same shade of red as her hair, and Shinji's face, as soon as she realized _why_ Shinji's member was at attention.  
最终，红发女孩恢复了足够的理智感到尴尬，发出了一声尖叫，吓得 Pen Pen 匆忙跑回他的冷却器，沙丁鱼被遗忘了。尖叫很快变成了脸红，她的脸变成了和她头发一样的红色，真嗣的脸也一样，她立刻意识到为什么真嗣的那东西会如此挺立。

"It's not polite to stare, pervert." Asuka scolded as she recovered her faculties for thought and speech. The reprimand came with an embarrassed smile rather than real venom lacing the words.  
"盯着看是不礼貌的，变态。" 明日香恢复了思考和说话的能力，责备道。这番训斥带着一丝尴尬的微笑，而不是真正的恶意。

Shinji for his part had barely even registered Asuka's words. If the view of her pussy hadn't been enough, when she had turned around and yelped it had caused her breasts to bounce in such a sexy way. Added to that the fact that Asuka's embarrassed hands covered her face and not her bust or mound and Shinji's rock hard erection was agony. His cock begged for release as it couldn't get any harder as pre-cum began to ooze out. He thought to say 'Sorry' but couldn't tell if he had vocalized it or not.  
至于真嗣，他几乎没注意到明日香的话。如果她下体的景象还不够，那么当她转身并惊叫时，胸部随之性感地弹跳，更是让他难以自持。更别说明日香尴尬地用手遮住脸而不是胸或私处，这让真嗣坚硬如石的勃起痛苦不堪。他的阴茎渴求释放，因为它已经硬到不能再硬，前液开始渗出。他想说声“对不起”，却无法确定自己是否真的说出了口。

'Dammit hormones we had sex _**maybe**_ an hour ago what is wrong with you!' Asuka thought as she felt her own loins begin to burn with the fire of desire as her eyes inevitably fell to Shinji's member. 'It'd be a shame to waste it.' Asuka concluded, telling herself that it was _**her**_ conscious mind making the choice and that she was not a slave to her hormones.  
'该死的荷尔蒙，我们一个小时前才做过爱，你到底怎么了！'明日香想着，感觉到自己的下体因欲望之火而燃烧，目光不由自主地落在真嗣的阴茎上。'浪费了就太可惜了。'明日香得出结论，告诉自己这是理智的选择，而不是荷尔蒙的奴隶。

Asuka moved first. She got down on her knees in front of Shinji, who was leaning against the kitchen counter hypnotized by the sight of the girl in front of him. She pulled down his blue boxers and watched as this action cause Shinji's cock to begin bouncing up and down. As his member slowed down Asuka took it in her hand and began softly stroking his cock as she tenderly kissed the underside of his shaft. Starting from the base she went up until she got to the head of his cock. She twirled her tongue around the bulbous mass before licking the tip and tasting his pre-cum. She then looked up into his eyes and took his member in her mouth, her head bobbing up and down as her mouth made sucking sounds.  
明日香率先行动。她跪在背靠厨房台面、被眼前女孩迷住的真嗣面前，拉下他的蓝色内裤，注视着这一动作让真嗣的阴茎开始上下弹跳。当他的阴茎逐渐放缓时，明日香握住它，开始温柔地抚摸，同时轻柔地亲吻着他的阴茎下方。从根部开始，她一路向上，直至抵达顶端。她用舌头绕着那圆润的头部旋转，然后舔舐尖端，品尝他的前液。接着，她抬头望向他的眼睛，将他的阴茎含入口中，头部随之上下起伏，口中发出吸吮的声音。

"Oh God, Asuka…" Shinji said finally finding his voice as he moved his hands up to Asuka's head to guide her in her ministrations. Their eyes remained locked on each other. Shinji's fingers twirled and played with the locks of red hair around Asuka's neural adapters absent-mindedly while Asuka's left hand went to Shinji's thigh for support while her right fondled his balls ever so gently. She felt them begin tighten, become smaller and firmer, as they readied another load in response to Asuka's blowjob.  
“哦，天哪，明日香……” 真嗣终于找回了自己的声音，双手向上移动到明日香的头部，引导她的动作。他们的目光始终紧紧相锁。真嗣的手指心不在焉地缠绕和拨弄着明日香神经接头周围的红色发丝，而明日香的左手则放在真嗣的大腿上以支撑，右手则轻柔地抚弄着他的睾丸。她感觉到它们开始紧缩，变得更小更坚实，为明日香的口交做好了准备，即将释放另一波高潮。

Asuka took her hand off of Shinji's balls and placed both her hands on Shinji's thighs. She momentarily stopped her sucking, stopped looking into Shinji's cobalt eyes as her eyelids closed as she readied herself. Opening her mouth as wide as it could get while about a third of Shinji's length was still in her mouth.  
明日香将手从真嗣的睾丸上移开，双手放在真嗣的大腿上。她暂时停止了吸吮，不再凝视真嗣的钴蓝色眼睛，眼睑闭合，准备着。她尽可能地张大嘴巴，尽管真嗣的阴茎还有大约三分之一留在她的嘴里。

'She's not going to try that agai-' Shinji didn't get a chance to finish that thought as Asuka's head went down his length, gagging as she went, though seemingly less so this time. She soon forced her way to the base of his shaft and opened her eyes to look up at Shinji. Her throat contracting not quite rhythmically around his cockhead as her mouth tried to take breaths and gag at the same time.  
"'她不会再尝试那个了——' 真嗣没能完成这个念头，因为明日香的头已经埋进了他的双腿间，尽管这次似乎不那么难受，但还是呛到了。她很快强迫自己到达了他的根部，睁开眼睛向上看着真嗣。她的喉咙不规律地收缩着，试图同时呼吸和呛咳，围绕着他的龟头。

She also began to wiggle her tongue back and forth, stroking the underside of Shinji's shaft. After some time of just standing there and taking in the feeling Shinji began to move and gently stroked his cock back and forth gently fucking her throat as his hands held her head in place and stared into her cerulean eyes. It was such a new experience for Asuka to feel Shinji's cock where it was as she gagged on it and stared into the lust in Shinji's eyes. But all good things must come to an end and she tapped Shinji's thigh twice letting him know she needed to come up for air.  
她也开始来回摆动舌头，抚摸着真嗣阴茎的下方。在原地站了一会儿，感受着这一切，真嗣开始动了起来，轻轻地前后抽动着，温柔地用他的阴茎插入她的喉咙，同时双手固定住她的头，凝视着她天蓝色的眼睛。对明日香来说，感受到真嗣的阴茎在那里，同时呛咳并凝视着他眼中的欲望，是一种全新的体验。但美好的时光总是短暂的，她轻轻地拍了拍真嗣的大腿两次，示意她需要上来呼吸。

Shinji relented and let go of her head but the feeling of her giving such a deep blowjob was too much for Shinji's already strained member. As Asuka's face separated from his cock and her hands returned to fondle his balls and stroke his shaft, Shinji came.  
真嗣终于让步，松开了她的头，但那种深喉口交的感觉对真嗣本已紧张的部位来说太过强烈。当明日香的脸从他的阴茎上分开，她的手重新回到抚摸他的睾丸和抽动他的阴茎时，真嗣射了。

Spurt after spurt erupted from his cock right onto Asuka's cute face. A little got in her flowing red hair, but thankfully none got in her eyes, instead being concentrated in three big splotches, one on her forehead, one on her chin and mouth area and the other on her left cheek. Along with a dozen or so drops scattered around the rest of her face. In all the times they had been intimate Shinji had never cum on Asuka's face. That was, correction _had_, been beyond her pride's ability to accept. Now reality forced her to accept the semen on her face.  
一股接一股的精液从他的阴茎喷射到明日香可爱的脸上。少许溅入了她飘逸的红发中，但幸运的是没有进入她的眼睛，而是集中在三个大斑点上，一个在她的额头上，一个在她的下巴和嘴巴区域，另一个在她的左脸颊上。还有十几滴散布在她脸部的其他地方。在他们所有的亲密时刻中，真嗣从未在明日香的脸上射精。那是，更正为曾经，超出了她自尊心的接受能力。现在现实迫使她接受脸上的精液。

Asuka recovering first from the shock, brought her hands to her face. She thought she would have felt anger, Shinji thought she would have felt unbridled rage, but instead she felt something more akin to curiosity as her hands went to her face. She touched the splotch near her chin and pulled a tiny bit of it away between her fingers. She absently began to play with it, pressing her fingers together and then pulling them apart and watching cum form thin strands and then break as the strain became too much. It was not the first time she had felt cum, hell she had _**tasted**_ cum just earlier today and she probably still had some left in her pussy that she hadn't cleaned out from earlier.  
明日香从震惊中率先恢复过来，双手抚上脸颊。她本以为自己会感到愤怒，真嗣也以为她会爆发出难以遏制的怒火，然而她却感受到了一种更接近好奇的情绪。她的手指触碰着下巴附近的斑点，轻轻地用指尖将其扯离肌肤。她漫不经心地玩弄着，将手指并拢又分开，看着精液形成细丝，在拉扯中逐渐断裂。这并非她第一次触碰精液，天哪，今天早些时候她甚至还尝过，或许私处还残留着些许未清理干净的痕迹。

She had felt a lot of cum over the last several months of being with Shinji, on her breasts, back, ass, stomach, inside her pussy and mouth. In the beginning she had thought it was disgusting but she had grown to be fascinated and enthralled by it. She took the cum she had been playing with and opened her mouth to lick it off of her fingers. She tasted the saltiness along with a bitter note of flavor as she swallowed it down. She opened her eyes again and looked towards Shinji's groin and in particular the source of the taste in her mouth.  
在与真嗣相处的过去几个月里，她感受到了许多精液，落在她的胸部、背部、臀部、腹部，甚至阴道和口中。起初，她觉得这很恶心，但随着时间的推移，她变得对此着迷并沉醉其中。她拿起刚才玩弄的精液，张开嘴，用手指舔干净。她尝到了咸味，还伴随着一丝苦涩，随着吞咽而下。她再次睁开眼睛，目光投向真嗣的下体，尤其是口中味道的源头。

'They're still so full of cum.' Asuka thought as she stared at Shinji's balls, entranced by them and their contents and the burning, inescapable desire they had produced in her loins. 'One day, when all this is over' she thought as she fondled his balls in her left hand while keeping a firm grip on his spent yet hard cock in her right, 'these will give me a child.' **Woah. STOP.** Where did that thought come from Sohryu? Not even in her fantasies at the height of her infatuation with Kaji did the idea of having a child ever occur to her. To any of the fairer sex unfortunate enough to be near her during her monthly visit from biology, she would loudly and bombastically lament her having to suffer menstrual cramps despite not wanting children.  
「它们还满是精液。」明日香想着，凝视着真嗣的睾丸，被它们及其内容物所吸引，那股燃烧的、无法逃避的欲望在她下腹中滋生。「有一天，当这一切结束时」她想着，左手抚弄着他的睾丸，右手则紧紧握住他疲惫却坚挺的阴茎，「这些会为我带来一个孩子。」哇哦。停。这念头从何而来，惣流？即使在迷恋加持最深的时候，她幻想中也从未出现过生孩子的想法。对于那些在她每月生理期不幸靠近她的女性，她会大声且夸张地抱怨自己不得不忍受痛经，尽管她并不想要孩子。

But why that thought now as her face was covered in Shinji's thick seed, entranced by his virility? Why wasn't she angry at him _again_ not warning her he was going to cum, and shooting his load the one place she had told him not to? Why? Asuka was broken out of her musings as she noticed Shinji's cock begin to deflate after having released its load on her face. 'Oh no you don't.' She thought as she took his cock in her mouth once again and began sucking.  
但为何此刻她的脸被真嗣浓稠的精液覆盖，沉醉于他的阳刚之气时，会冒出这样的念头？为何她不再次对他生气，因为他没有警告她即将射精，而且将精液射在了她明确告诉他不要射的地方？为什么？明日香从沉思中惊醒，注意到真嗣的阴茎在释放精液后开始萎缩。'哦，不，你休想。'她想着，再次将他的阴茎含入口中，开始吮吸。

"Ah Asuka, wh..?" Shinji tried forming words as his fellow pilot began furiously going up and down on his cock with her mouth, reversing its shrinking and making his member hard again.  
“啊，明日香，怎...？”真嗣试图开口说话，但他的同伴驾驶员正疯狂地用嘴上下套弄他的阴茎，阻止了它的萎缩，并使他的阴茎再次硬挺起来。

Asuka removed her mouth from Shinji's cock yet continued to stroke it with her hands and looked up at Shinji's cobalt eyes.  
明日香从真嗣的阴茎上移开嘴，但继续用手抚弄它，抬头望向真嗣那双深蓝色的眼睛。

Shinji looked down at the view of his lover. Her eyes' had an almost pleading, desperate look on her cum covered face. It reminded Shinji of what he'd seen in the shower mirror nigh on an hour ago. He had been convinced her momentary fascination and silence had been merely the prelude to an outburst of fury so great he wasn't sure he'd survive. Then after he saw her playing with and swallowing his cum his mind had gone completely and he was sure he'd have a nosebleed. But now something awoke in him, a feeling that had become more and more familiar the longer his and Asuka's relationship went on. Resolve. The will to actually use his strength and be part of the world around him not just a bystander.  
真嗣低头凝视着他的爱人。她那沾满精液的脸庞上，眼神近乎恳求，充满了绝望。这让真嗣想起了大约一小时前在淋浴镜中看到的自己。他曾确信，她那短暂的着迷和沉默只是即将爆发的巨大愤怒的前奏，他不确定自己能否挺过去。然后，当他看到她玩弄并吞咽他的精液时，他的思绪完全混乱了，他确信自己会流鼻血。但现在，某种东西在他心中觉醒，随着他与明日香的关系越来越长久，这种感觉变得越来越熟悉。决心。一种真正运用自己的力量，成为周围世界一部分的意志，而不仅仅是一个旁观者。

"Okay." He said nodding, as he picked her up and placed her on the kitchen counter. Asuka was surprised by his speed but nonetheless enthralled by the dominance Shinji showed as he opened up her legs so that her pussy was bared before him.  
“好吧。”他点头说道，随即抱起她，将她放在厨房的台面上。明日香对他的速度感到惊讶，但仍然被真嗣展现出的主导力所吸引，他打开她的双腿，让她赤裸的下体展现在他面前。

He had that look of determination on his face that she had only ever seen when they piloted or were intimate. Shinji lined up his tip at her entrance. Despite how wet he could see she was and the spit that remained on his cock from her mouth he still licked his fingers and moistened the tip of his member before entering her.  
他脸上那种决心满满的神情，她只在他们驾驶 EVA 或亲密时见过。真嗣对准她的入口，尽管她已经湿透，他的阴茎上还残留着她口中的唾液，他仍然舔了舔手指，湿润了龟头，然后进入她。

This proved unnecessary as upon entrance his cock just slid in with not resistance, bottoming out in what seemed like a moment. Shinji was now fully inside of her and their faces were maybe a few inches apart, two pairs of blue orbs gazing into the other searching for warmth, comfort, acceptance. Quiet squelches filled the kitchen as Shinji's hard member began thrust in and out of the squishy, incendiary hole that was Asuka's pussy. It wasn't tight, it had that weird looseness a pussy had when it was exceedingly ready for a cock. Where rather than feeling it squeeze down on his cock Shinji only felt a few ridges here and there as his cock went in and out with almost no resistance.  
这证明是多余的，因为一进入，他的阴茎就毫无阻力地滑了进去，几乎瞬间就到达了最深处。真嗣现在完全在她体内，他们的脸相距不过几英寸，两双蓝色的眼睛凝视着对方，寻找温暖、安慰和接纳。厨房里回荡着安静的吮吸声，真嗣坚硬的阴茎开始在柔软、炽热的洞穴——明日香的阴道中进进出出。它并不紧致，有一种奇怪的松弛感，当阴道极度渴望阴茎时就会有这种感觉。真嗣并没有感觉到它紧握他的阴茎，只是偶尔感觉到一些凸起，他的阴茎几乎毫无阻力地进出。

This caused Shinji to push his cock in deeper with each thrust, instinctively looking for some part of her pussy that would squeeze or stroke his cock. Each time he would pull out almost his whole length and thrust back in until their hips colliding in a slapping noise would stop his plunge. These deep strokes caused Asuka to begin to bite her lip to keep herself from groaning in pleasure, but soft moans still escaped her mouth and joined the symphony of love their bodies were making in the kitchen.  
这使得真嗣每次挺动都更深地推进自己的阴茎，本能地寻找她阴道中能紧握或抚弄他阴茎的部分。每次他几乎完全抽出，再猛地插入，直到两人的臀部相撞发出啪的一声才停止深入。这些深沉的抽插让明日香开始咬住嘴唇以防自己因快感而呻吟出声，但轻柔的呻吟仍从她口中逸出，与他们在厨房中身体交织的爱之交响曲融为一体。

Throughout all the thrusts of their lovemaking Shinji and Asuka kept their eyes locked on each other. The combination of the sight of Asuka's cum-covered face biting her lip and the feeling her wet pussy gave his cock made it so he didn't last long. Despite it being the fourth time he had cum that day Shinji still released a sizeable load into Asuka. The feeling of the cum colliding with her walls and seeing the look on Shinji's face as he came, eye's closing, mouth opening to release an almost sigh-like groan pushed Asuka over the edge herself and she had her own orgasm. Her entire body trembled and shook in Shinji's arms and she closed her eyes as she placed her chin on his shoulder to support her heaving chest. This got cum on his shirt but whatever he needed to wash it anyway. Now Asuka had both a face covered by and a pussy filled with Shinji's cum.  
在整个缠绵的过程中，真嗣和明日香始终凝视着对方。明日香那沾满精液的脸颊咬着嘴唇，以及她湿润的私处给予他肉棒的快感，让他无法持久。尽管那天他已经第四次射精，真嗣依然在明日香体内释放了大量精液。感受到精液冲击她的内壁，以及看到真嗣高潮时闭上眼睛、张嘴发出近乎叹息的呻吟，这让明日香也达到了高潮。她的全身在真嗣的怀中颤抖摇晃，她闭上眼睛，将下巴靠在他的肩膀上支撑着剧烈起伏的胸部。这使得他的衬衫沾上了精液，但无所谓，反正他需要洗衣服。现在，明日香的脸上和私处都充满了真嗣的精液。

They stayed like that for a moment, leaning on each other, the other's short, sharp, panting breaths echoing in their ears.  
他们就这样相依片刻，彼此依靠，对方的短促急促的呼吸在耳边回响。

They were broken out of their post-coital reverie, again, by a familiar sound, or perhaps squawk is a better word?  
他们再次被一个熟悉的声音——或许用“嘎吱”来形容更贴切——从性爱后的沉醉中唤醒。

"Wark?!" Pen Pen said, well in the loosest possible definition of _said_, as he returned, wondering if his luck with acquiring sardines would be better with the passage of time, and bodily fluids.  
“哇克？！”Pen Pen 叫道，当然这是最宽松的定义，他回来了，想知道随着时间的推移，他获取沙丁鱼的运气是否会更好，以及身体分泌物。

"**STUPID BIRD!"** Asuka screeched at the warm water penguin grabbing the first thing she could, in this case a spatula from the kitchen counter. While screaming "_**Can't you see we're in the middle of something!**_" she threw the kitchen utensil, with Shinji's member still inside her no less. Though because they were still coupled together, and her mind was still heady from the high of her orgasm, her aim was atrocious and she only hit the wall next to Pen Pen as he scurried back to his freezer.  
“笨鸟！”明日香对着那只抓起手边第一件东西——这次是从厨房台面上抓起的铲子——的热水企鹅尖叫道。她一边尖叫着“你没看到我们正忙着吗！”一边将厨具扔了出去，尽管此时她的体内还留着真嗣的阴茎。但由于他们仍紧密相连，且她的思绪仍因高潮的余韵而迷糊，她的准头极差，只击中了 Pen Pen 身旁墙壁，而他则匆忙逃回冰箱。

'I really hope she missed him on purpose.' Shinji thought as he calmly looked at his less than calm lover. He took this moment to extricate himself from her. Shinji placed his hands on Asuka's knees and eased his cock out of her seemingly soaking pussy. After the head popped out he took a steep back and took in the sight before him.  
“我真希望她是故意没打中他。”真嗣心想，同时平静地看着他那不太平静的恋人。他趁机从她体内抽离。真嗣将手放在明日香的膝盖上，缓缓将自己的阴茎从她湿漉漉的阴道中抽出。当阴茎头露出后，他后退一步，欣赏着眼前的景象。

Asuka was sitting on the kitchen counter her face had turned back to regard him, still covered in his earlier load, a look of almost puzzlement had replaced her earlier anger. If Shinji was a mind reader he'd have heard a single word in Asuka's mind 'Empty'. Her chest was rising and falling rhythmically, accentuating the sheen of sweat that was glistening off of her shapely breasts. And below those Asuka's pussy was spread open and the tiniest bit of white was just beginning to poke out of her hole. That soon turned into a slow stream as Shinji's cum flowed out of Asuka's pussy and down toward the counter. Though it thankfully never touched the cooking surface, as Shinji's thick seed stopped its journey leaving Asuka with the perfect creampie, at least from Shinji's point of view.  
明日香坐在厨房的台面上，她的脸转回来注视着他，依然覆盖着他早先的痕迹，之前的愤怒已被近乎困惑的表情所取代。如果真嗣能读心，他会听到明日香心中只有一个词：‘空虚’。她的胸脯有节奏地起伏，突显出从她曼妙乳房上闪耀的汗珠。而在那之下，明日香的私处敞开着，一丝白色正开始从她的洞口探出。很快，这变成了一股缓慢的细流，真嗣的精液从明日香的私处流出，向着台面流去。幸运的是，它并未触及烹饪区，因为真嗣浓稠的精液停止了流动，给明日香留下了一个完美的体内射精，至少在真嗣看来是如此。

"What did I tell you about staring baka?" Asuka reprimanded as she hit him lightly on the shoulder as Shinji's eyes lingered too long on the unfolding cum drama.  
“我不是告诉过你别盯着看吗，笨蛋？”明日香责备道，轻轻地在他肩膀上打了一下，因为真嗣的目光在不断展开的精液戏剧中停留过久。

"Sorry." Shinji said reflexively bringing his eyes up to stare into hers. The cum on her face was beginning to harden and turn increasingly viscous as their eyes stared into each other's again. Slowly Asuka brought herself down from the kitchen counter back down onto her feet.  
“对不起。” 真嗣本能地回应，抬起眼睛凝视着她的双眸。她脸上的精液开始变硬，粘稠度逐渐增加，两人的目光再次交织在一起。慢慢地，明日香从厨房台面上下来，重新站稳脚跟。

"Give me your shirt, we got it dirty." Asuka said, tugging at bottom of the white T-shirt to help him out of it. That task accomplished she headed toward where the laundry was to dispose of it. She kept her thighs together as she walked away in order not to lose the creampie Shinji gave her, to keep the warm thick seed with her for a bit longer.  
“把你的衬衫给我，弄脏了。” 明日香说着，拉扯着白色 T 恤的下摆帮他脱下。完成这项任务后，她走向洗衣区准备处理这件衣服。她走路时双腿紧闭，以免失去真嗣给她的那片奶油派，想让那温暖的浓稠种子在她体内多停留一会儿。

Shinji watched her go away, forgetting Asuka's earlier command and examined quite intently the way her ass was bouncing back and forth. Eventually she went out of sight and a now nude Shinji resumed his task of making dinner.  
真嗣目送她离开，忘记了明日香之前的命令，专注地观察着她臀部来回摆动的样子。最终她消失在视线之外，现在赤裸的真嗣继续他的晚餐制作任务。

"Now where'd the spatula go?"  
“那把铲子跑哪儿去了？”

Dinner was ready thirty minutes after that question and finished by a certain redhead in approximately two minutes of ravenous hunger. Satiated, Asuka began a routine that only happened when she and Shinji were alone together. She _**washed**_ the dishes. The first time it had happened nigh on a month ago Shinji had sat with his jaw scraping the floor for a solid hour.  
晚餐在那句话问出后三十分钟准备好了，而某个红发女孩在两分钟的饥饿中狼吞虎咽地吃完。吃饱后，明日香开始了一项只有她和真嗣独处时才会进行的例行公事。她洗碗。第一次发生这事儿大约一个月前，真嗣坐在那里，下巴几乎擦着地板，整整一个小时。

Asuka for her part had seen it as natural. Her earlier insistence on him doing the chores around the apartment, and hell most of her attitude toward Shinji and everyone else in her life, sans Kaji, had been about dominance. She was the best, so naturally she should dominate those around her. What a very German thought-process Sohryu. But the longer she had been with Shinji, the less she felt the need to be domineering around him, the more confident she felt in her own skin simply being herself. _'Comfortable.'_ That's the word Asuka thought with a smile on her face as she reflected on the last several months as her hands were covered in soap suds.  
对明日香来说，这很自然。她早先坚持让他做公寓里的家务，以及她对真嗣和生活中其他人的态度（除了加持），都是关于支配的。她是最好的，所以自然应该支配周围的人。多么德国式的思维方式，惣流。但随着与真嗣相处的时间越长，她越觉得在他面前不需要那么霸道，越能自信地做自己。'舒适。' 明日香微笑着，回想起过去几个月，她的手被肥皂泡沫覆盖时，心里想着这个词。

Did the baka understand how he made her feel and what he had changed in her? 'Probably not.' Asuka thought as she felt the warm water on her hands as she rinsed the last plate before putting it on the rack to dry. 'But I'm glad I decided to have that talk with him after Mt. Asama.'  
那个笨蛋明白他让她有什么感受，以及他在她身上改变了什么吗？'大概不明白。' 明日香想着，感受着温暖的水流过她的手，她冲洗着最后一个盘子，然后把它放在架子上晾干。'但我很高兴在浅间山之后决定和他谈谈。'

Pen Pen even finally got his sardines as Shinji and Asuka settled onto the couch and watched an old pre-impact movie. Some strange heist movie with the criminals having color-coded names stealing diamonds or some-such. Shinji didn't much understand it, but what else was new.  
就连 Pen Pen 也终于吃到了他的沙丁鱼，真嗣和明日香坐在沙发上，看了一部古老的灾前电影。是一部奇怪的盗窃片，罪犯们有着颜色编码的名字，偷窃钻石之类的。真嗣不太明白，但这又有什么新鲜的呢。

As the credits started rolling down the screen Asuka stood up from the couch, turned the TV off, and grabbed Shinji's hand as she led him towards his room. Or more accurately his bed. She opened the door of _Shinji's Lovely Suite_ and then without warning, yanked Shinji forward and spun him around. Allowing his intrinsic clumsiness to guide his backside to the bed where he plopped down rather gracelessly. Especially considering they were both still naked from earlier.  
当片尾字幕开始在屏幕上滚动时，明日香从沙发上站起来，关掉电视，抓住真嗣的手，带他走向他的房间。更确切地说，是他的床。她打开真嗣的可爱套房的门，然后毫无预警地，猛拉真嗣向前，转身让他转了一圈。让他的天生笨拙引导他的臀部落到床上，他相当不雅地坐了下来。尤其是考虑到他们俩都还赤裸着身子。

Befuddled in a way only Shinji could be he looked up and saw the predatory grin on Asuka's face as she turned out the light and shut his door to the outside world. Shinji gulped wordlessly as he heard Asuka's words as she made her way to him:  
只有真嗣才会感到的那种困惑，他抬头一看，只见明日香脸上露出狩猎般的笑容，她关掉灯，将他的门隔绝了外面的世界。真嗣无声地咽了口唾沫，听着明日香走向他时的话语：

"Now, it's my turn to fuck you."Asuka said in a silkily seductive tone as she finally made it to his bed and with her hand on his chest she guided him down so he was lying down on his bed. This confirmed Shinji's earlier suspicions for the kind of night he was in for. From experience he knew that when Asuka was in control during sex, she became rather, what's a polite word for it?…deranged, yeah that worked. These thoughts filled his head as Asuka got on top and began to straddle him.  
“现在，轮到我操你了。”明日香用丝滑诱人的语气说道，她终于来到他的床边，手放在他的胸口，引导他躺下。这证实了真嗣之前对今晚所期待的那种夜晚的猜测。从经验中他知道，当明日香在性爱中掌控全局时，她会变得相当，用什么礼貌的词来形容呢？……疯狂，没错，就是这样。这些念头充斥着他的脑海，而明日香则跨坐在他身上，开始骑乘他。

'Gott, evolution you really nailed it with the teenage sex drive' Asuka thought as she felt her wetness seeping from her opening onto Shinji's stiffening cock as she slid her lower lips up and down along Shinji's crotch.  
“天啊，进化你真是把青少年的性欲发挥到了极致。”明日香想着，感觉到自己的湿润从开口处渗出，沿着真嗣逐渐勃起的阴茎，她滑动着自己的下唇，上下摩擦着真嗣的胯部。

She continued that motion as she leaned her face down to his and passionately kissed Shinji, her head pushing his down into the pillow, her teeth nibbling at his lip, his nose, his ear. She could feel the goosebumps form on his skin and knew that he was fully under her power now. She took his now hard cock and guided it into her wet hole, sliding it in until their hips met again.  
她继续着这个动作，将脸贴近他的，热情地吻着真嗣，她的头将他压向枕头，牙齿轻咬着他的唇、鼻、耳。她能感觉到他皮肤上起的鸡皮疙瘩，知道他现在完全被她掌控了。她握住他已变得坚挺的阴茎，引导它进入她湿润的私处，缓缓滑入直到两人的臀部再次相贴。

She pulled away from his face and placed her hands onto his chest for support, slowly lifting herself up off of Shinji's cock until only the head remained in her, then slowly sliding back down. Shinji's eyes had adjusted to the darkness and he saw Asuka as she began to bounce more aggressively on his cock. The pale moonlight coming through the window illuminated her bouncing breasts, twirling as Asuka was determined to thoroughly ravish Shinji. He brought his hands up to her chest and squeezed her sizeable bust.  
她从他的脸上移开，双手撑在他的胸前以支撑自己，慢慢地从真嗣的阴茎上抬起身体，直到只有头部还留在她体内，然后缓缓滑下。真嗣的眼睛已经适应了黑暗，他看到明日香开始更猛烈地在他阴茎上跳动。透过窗户的苍白月光照亮了她跳动的乳房，明日香决心要彻底占有真嗣。他抬起手，握住她丰满的胸部，用力挤压。

As Asuka continued to bounce up and down on Shinji's cock feeling herself approaching the edge of her orgasm she picked up the pace, Shinji's room filling with the sound of her ass slapping into his thighs as she fucked him more vigorously looking for her release. Shinji responded to her robust pace by squeezing her breasts in his already tight grip. Asuka paused her bouncing only to begin grinding her hips on his crotch. Moving her lower portions in a counterclockwise circle in an attempt to get Shinji's cock to find what he always managed to find with his fingers, her g-spot. After the fifth rotation she got the angle and height right and Shinji's cockhead stroked the place that was different from all the others. Being a genius she managed to reproduce this result on the next time around…and the ten more that followed until on the last time around as Shinji's cock hit her spot just right and she came. Her entire body shook and she threw her head back as she let ecstasy take hold.  
随着明日香继续在真嗣的阴茎上上下跳动，感受到自己即将达到高潮的边缘，她加快了节奏，真嗣的房间里充满了她臀部拍打在他大腿上的声音，她更加用力地操他，寻找着释放。真嗣回应她强劲的节奏，用已经紧握的手捏住她的乳房。明日香暂停了跳动，转而开始在真嗣的胯部上磨蹭她的臀部。她以逆时针方向移动下半身，试图让真嗣的阴茎找到他总是能用手指找到的地方，她的 G 点。经过第五次旋转，她找到了正确的角度和高度，真嗣的龟头触碰到了那个与众不同的地方。作为一个天才，她设法在下一次旋转中重现了这个结果……以及接下来的十次旋转，直到最后一次旋转时，真嗣的阴茎正好击中了她的那个点，她达到了高潮。她的整个身体颤抖着，她仰头向后，任由极乐掌控。

Shinji saw Asuka come, and felt her insides squeeze his cock and her body shake against his as she experienced what felt like an intense orgasm. He knew that Asuka loved that feeling of accomplishment, that she could make him cum all by herself, without him having to move or stroke against her walls. Today however, was not going to be one of those days. Hey there's a pretty steep curve in the amount of stimulation it takes between the first and fifth time a guy comes.  
真嗣看到明日香走过来，感觉到她的体内紧握着他的阴茎，她的身体在他身上颤抖，仿佛经历了一次强烈的性高潮。他知道明日香喜欢那种成就感，她能独自让他射精，不需要他移动或在她体内抽动。然而今天，不会是那样的日子。嘿，男人从第一次到第五次射精所需的刺激量有一个相当陡峭的曲线。

So moving his hands from her breasts he wrapped his arms around her back and pulled her down so she was lying down on top of him with her head to the left of his and her flowing red hair spread wildly all over their intertwined bodies. His right hand went to her ass and grabbed a handful of it as he began to stroke his cock into her pussy, slowly at first as she came down from her high and then he increased his speed to as fast as he could go. Aggressively fucking her as he looked for his own release.  
于是，他把手从她的乳房上移开，双臂环抱她的背部，将她拉下，让她躺在他身上，头偏向他的左侧，她那飘逸的红发狂野地散布在他们交缠的身体上。他的右手伸向她的臀部，抓了一把，开始在她阴道内抽插他的阴茎，起初缓慢，待她从高潮中平复后，他加快了速度，尽可能地快速。他激烈地操她，寻找自己的释放。

He heard Asuka begin panting next to him in his ear. Her breath hitching and her pussy squeezing his cock even more than before as Shinji's cock bulged and strained searching, begging for its chance to cum.  
他听到明日香在他耳边开始喘息。她的呼吸急促，阴道比之前更紧地挤压着他的阴茎，真嗣的阴茎膨胀着，挣扎着，渴望着射精的机会。

'Going…to…come…again…' Asuka managed to actualize the words in her mind as Shinji sent in one last, strong, stroke inside of her to take him over the edge and released his seed into her, the feeling of the cum impacting her insides managed to take Asuka over the edge for a second time and she shook on top of him.  
“要……再来……一次……” 明日香在心中勉强拼凑出这些词句，而真嗣在她体内又猛烈地冲刺了一下，终于将她推至顶峰，释放出他的种子。那种精液冲击她体内的感觉让明日香再次达到高潮，她在真嗣身上颤抖着。

After a moment of heavy breathing Asuka raised her hips up and let go of Shinji's member her pussy dripping cum as it went. A drop of cum fell on Shinji's crotch just above his shaft, another on the underside of his cock, midway up the shaft as well as it rested horizontally, and still yet a third fell onto his balls, maybe his sperm were homesick?  
在沉重的呼吸声中，明日香抬起臀部，放开了真嗣的阴茎，她的私处滴着精液。一滴精液落在真嗣的胯部，就在他的阴茎上方，另一滴落在阴茎中段下方，当它水平放置时，还有一滴落在他的睾丸上，也许他的精子想家了？

Asuka grabbed some tissues from next to Shinji's bed and after wiping her own opening she cleaned Shinji's member as well before tossing the soiled tissue into a nearby trashcan. She then curled up next to Shinji, placing her head on the right side of his chest and listening to Shinji's heartbeat, and letting the gentle rise and fall of his chest lull her into comfort.  
明日香从真嗣床边抓了一些纸巾，先擦拭了自己的私处，然后清理了真嗣的阴茎，随后将用过的纸巾扔进了附近的垃圾桶。她蜷缩在真嗣身边，将头靠在他胸口的右侧，聆听着他的心跳，感受着他胸膛的轻柔起伏，让她感到安心。

They stayed like that for what seemed like a lifetime, letting their bodies come down from their hormone induced high. Eventually Shinji broke the silence by giving voice to a thought that had been running around in his mind for a while:  
他们就这样停留了仿佛一生一世，任由身体从荷尔蒙激增的高潮中缓缓回落。最终，真嗣打破了沉默，将脑海中盘旋已久的念头说了出来：

"We ought to do something nice for Hikari. For all she's done for us."  
“我们应该为 Hikari 做点什么。她为我们做了这么多。”

"Yeah, she told me today her sister had asked her if she could set me up with one of her friends." Asuka said not moving her head up from his chest, still content to listening to his heart as they talked.  
“是啊，她今天告诉我，她姐姐问她能不能安排我和她朋友中的一人见面。”明日香说着，头依旧靠在他的胸前，依然满足于听着他的心跳，边聊边倾听。

"That's…not exactly what I had in mind." Shinji said with sour and jealous notes he later regretted and hoped Asuka didn't discern. "Besides I'm guessing she rejected that idea in the nicest way possible, being Hikari and all that?" Shinji continued, more to allay his own jealousy rather than convey his thoughts.  
"那…并不是我原本的意思。" 真嗣带着酸涩和嫉妒的语气说道，事后他后悔了，希望明日香没有察觉。"再说了，我猜她以最委婉的方式拒绝了那个提议，毕竟她是光嘛？" 真嗣继续说道，更多的是为了平息自己的嫉妒，而不是表达他的想法。

"Yeah. She's the only one who knows we're sleeping together. Unless you brag about banging the hottest girl at school on an almost _daily_ basis to those stooges?" Asuka said in a faux-accusatory tone and tilting her eyes up to look at Shinji's face.  
"是啊。她是唯一知道我们在一起睡觉的人。除非你几乎每天都向那些傻瓜炫耀你和学校最火辣的女孩上床？" 明日香用一种假装的指责语气说道，同时向上斜眼看着真嗣的脸。

"Hehehe." Shinji chuckled before answering, "If I did then I'm pretty positive that the whole school would know just before my body hit the floor."  
"呵呵呵。" 真嗣笑了几声后回答，"如果我真的那么做了，那我敢肯定，在我倒地之前，整个学校都会知道这件事。"

"Got that right." Asuka said with her trademarked confidence and fiery spirit while leaning her head up and looking at Shinji's face. Asuka's neck complained at holding this angle for too long and she moved her head back to its resting position on Shinji's chest. After some time and while twirling her finger around the nipple on his left pectoral she asked him the real question that had been nagging at her for the last two weeks, "Do you have to go?"  
"说对了。" 明日香带着她标志性的自信和火热的灵魂，抬起头看着真嗣的脸。明日香的脖子抱怨着保持这个角度太久，于是她将头移回真嗣胸前的休息位置。过了一会儿，她用手指在他的左胸肌上绕着乳头画圈，终于问出了困扰她两周的真正问题，"你非去不可吗？"

Shinji's ears picked up at that question. He knew exactly what she meant. He brought up his left hand and wrapped it around the one making figure-eights on his chest before answering:  
真嗣的耳朵捕捉到了这个问题。他完全明白她的意思。他抬起左手，将它环绕在她在他胸前画圈的手上，然后回答：

"I need to, it's been years since I've seen her." Shinji replied with a confidence very unbecoming of a doormat. "Plus I need to tell her about you." Shinji added with a squeeze on her right shoulder. Asuka smiled into his chest before sitting up and looking at Shinji face to face.  
"我必须去，我已经很多年没见过她了。" 真嗣回答道，语气中带着一种不像他平时那样软弱的坚定。"而且我需要告诉她关于你的事。" 真嗣补充道，同时轻轻捏了捏她的右肩。明日香在他胸前微笑，然后坐起身来，面对面地看着真嗣。

"Just do it when Commander Asshole isn't around, I don't think he'd like hearing how happy his son is." Asuka said as she moved her face to within an inch of his before giving him a small peck on the lips before continuing "And maybe edit out all the wild sex and bakas, baka."  
"只要在那个混蛋指挥官不在的时候做就行了，我觉得他不会想听到他儿子有多开心的。" 明日香说着，将脸凑到离他只有一英寸的地方，轻轻在他唇上啄了一下，然后继续说："也许还可以把那些疯狂的性爱和笨蛋都删掉，笨蛋。"

"Definitely." Shinji said through a chuckle as his face reddened at the thought of explaining all of _that_ to anyone, least of all his mother.  
"当然。" 真嗣笑着说，一想到要向任何人解释这些，尤其是他的母亲，他的脸就红了。

### Chapter 3 Leliel and Co

The chiming of a phone sounded throughout the Katsuragi household. One, two, three times the ringing echoed in the kitchen and throughout the apartment before it was answered by the resident chef and occasional doormat Shinji Ikari.  
电话的铃声在葛城家中回荡。铃声在厨房和整个公寓内回响了三次，最终被家里的厨师兼偶尔的受气包——碇真嗣接起。

"Katsuragi residence." Shinji said in his habitual monotone, hoping he didn't sound out of breath.  
“这里是葛城家。”真嗣用他惯常的单调语气说道，希望自己听起来没有气喘吁吁。

"Heey Shinji." A, if not drunk, then almost certainly buzzed Misato Katsuragi, said before regaining some composure before continuing. "I'm out drinking with Kaji, so I'll be home late." Misato stated rather bluntly and plainly, Shinji suspected to try and disguise just how far gone she already was. But before Shinji could voice any concerns, or even say 'Okay' the line abruptly went dead. So with a sigh he placed it back on its stand and returned to the couch in the living room where a certain redhead was sitting cross-legged and still pouting over the interruption the phone call had caused.  
“嘿，真嗣。”微醺，若非酩酊大醉，也定是酒意正浓的葛城美里说道，随后稍稍恢复了些镇定，继续道：“我和加持在外面喝酒，会晚点回家。”美里相当直白地陈述，真嗣猜测她试图掩饰自己已醉到何种程度。但未等真嗣表达任何关切，甚至来不及回应一声“好的”，电话便突兀地挂断了。他叹了口气，将话筒放回支架，回到客厅的沙发上，那里一位红发少女正盘腿而坐，仍因刚才的电话打扰而嘟着嘴生闷气。

"Who was it?" Asuka Langley Sohryu snarled, as if she could rip out the caller's throat with the mere tone of her voice. Shinji took a moment to look Asuka up and down, his gaze lingering a bit on her bare, crossed legs, before settling on her eyes. His German roommate was wearing strikingly red see-through panties that had gorgeous lace work that prevented them being too revealing but still risqué enough that someone, unaware of her sex life, would say that they were entirely too mature for someone of her age. Two protrusions just above her crossed arms revealed that the yellow shirt, two sizes too big, was the only other article of clothing the redhead was wearing.  
"是谁？" 惣流·明日香·兰格雷咆哮道，仿佛仅凭她的语气就能撕裂对方的喉咙。真嗣稍作停顿，上下打量着明日香，目光在她裸露且交叉的双腿上停留片刻，随后定格在她的眼睛上。他的德国室友穿着鲜红色的透明内裤，精致的蕾丝设计既避免了过于暴露，又足够大胆，以至于不了解她私生活的人会说，这对她这个年纪来说过于成熟了。交叉的双臂上方，两个凸起表明那件大两号的黄色衬衫是她身上唯一的其他衣物，红发少女仅此装扮。

"Misato. She's out drinking with Kaji, so she'll be home late." Shinji said as his mind replayed what they had been doing before being interrupted. Passionate kisses, his hands under her shirt, grasping at her mounds and exciting her nipples with gentle twists and pinches. Asuka took a moment to process what Shinji had said before replying.  
"是美里。她和加持出去喝酒了，所以会晚点回来。" 真嗣说道，脑海中回放着被打断前他们正在做的事情。热情的亲吻，他的手伸进她的衬衫下，握住她的双峰，用轻柔的扭动和捏掐刺激着她的乳头。明日香稍作思考，处理了真嗣的话后才回应。

"If that's the case…" The redhead began as she uncrossed her legs and looked at her fellow pilot standing before her in a pink shirt and blue boxers that did a bad job at hiding the bulge of his growing hard-on.  
"如果是这样的话……" 红发女孩开口说道，她解开了交叉的双腿，看着站在她面前的同伴，他穿着粉色衬衫和蓝色短裤，短裤没能很好地遮住他逐渐勃起的尴尬。

"Whaaaa…!?" Shinji cried out as Asuka lunged at him suddenly, pouncing on him and twirling him around so that he landed with his back flat on the couch and with her on top of him. His erection had come loose in the kerfuffle and now the alternate textures of the see-through velvet and the soft lace was making his cock swell even more as her hips instinctively ground themselves on his member.  
"哇啊啊……！？" 真嗣惊叫出声，因为明日香突然向他扑来，将他旋转着摔倒在沙发上，自己则压在他身上。他的勃起在混乱中暴露无遗，现在透过天鹅绒和柔软蕾丝的不同触感，让他的阴茎更加膨胀，而她的臀部本能地在他身上摩擦。

"…she probably won't be home tonight." Asuka said with a predatory grin on her face as she looked down at Shinji before moving her lips to his ear and whispering in a sultry voice "So we're gonna need to do something to kill the time…" she said nibbling his ear lobe before placing soft kisses on his neck.  
"……她今晚可能不会回家了。" 明日香带着掠食者的笑容说道，她低头看着真嗣，然后将嘴唇移到他的耳边，用挑逗的语气低声说："所以我们得找点事情打发时间……" 她轻咬他的耳垂，随后在他的脖子上留下温柔的吻。

"Isn't that what we were doing before?" Shinji objected as tingling lightning cascaded through his body.  
"这不就是我们之前在做的事吗？" 真嗣反驳道，身体里涌动着阵阵酥麻的电流。

Now as much as Shinji enjoyed Asuka when she was in the driver's seat of their escapades that wasn't what he wanted now. His blood was up, it felt as if it was boiling in his veins as the testosterone coursed through his body. That need to dominate that existed in all males no matter how well-trained they were was beginning to take hold. Shinji wanted to fuck, not be fucked. With that in mind he grabbed hold of Asuka's hands with his own and using their hips as a fulcrum he pivoted their intertwined bodies so that not only was he now on top, but his left knee was between her legs.  
尽管真嗣喜欢在冒险中处于驾驶座的明日香，但这并不是他现在想要的。他的血液沸腾，仿佛在血管中翻滚，随着睾丸素在体内奔涌，那种无论多么训练有素的男性都存在的支配欲望开始占据上风。真嗣想要的是征服，而不是被征服。带着这个念头，他抓住明日香的手，利用他们的臀部作为支点，转动他们交缠的身体，不仅让自己处于上方，还将左膝插入了她的双腿之间。

"Hmmm!?" Asuka's protest at being handled in such a way died as Shinji covered her mouth with his. His tongue forcing its way into her mouth and meeting hers. They struck and grappled for dominance much in the same way two thumbs would wrestle in a thumb war before finally Asuka's submitted. At the same time Shinji placed his other knee between Asuka's legs and began spreading them open.  
"嗯？！" 明日香对这种对待方式的抗议随着真嗣用嘴封住她的唇而消逝。他的舌头强行闯入她的口中，与她的舌头相遇，他们像两个拇指在拇指摔跤中一样争夺主导权，最终明日香屈服了。与此同时，真嗣将另一膝也插入明日香的双腿之间，开始将它们分开。

'Show me what a man does to his lady.' The thought rolled through seemingly unbidden in Asuka's mind as the lizard brain took over as she melted in the face of Shinji's lustful onslaught that an older version of herself would have been floored over.  
'让我看看一个男人如何对待他的女人。' 这个念头似乎不由自主地在明日香脑海中翻滚，当她的原始本能接管时，她在这股欲望的冲击下融化，换作是更成熟的她，恐怕也会为之倾倒。

Shinji finally brought his lips away from hers and moved his face lower, passing her chest and teasing her nipples through the yellow shirt as he went before coming to the hem and lifting it up to reveal her midriff. He knew Asuka's belly above where her ovaries were was her most ticklish and sensitive spot on her body. So he began tenderly kissing those spots while one of his hands kept both of hers above her head on the armrest of the couch while the other rubbed at Asuka's mound through her panties.  
真嗣终于从她的唇上移开，将脸向下移动，经过她的胸部，隔着黄色衬衫挑逗她的乳头，然后到达衣摆处，轻轻掀起，露出她的腰腹。他知道明日香卵巢上方的小腹是她身体最怕痒也最敏感的部位。于是他开始温柔地亲吻那些地方，同时一只手将她的双手按在沙发扶手上，另一只手则隔着内裤抚摸她的阴部。

Shinji's kisses sent shivers through Asuka's body and goosebumps covered her legs. Asuka's excitement was growing and she could feel the furnace her insides were becoming at the stimulation her body was getting. Shinji could feel Asuka's panties begin to become damp and let go of Asuka's hands and stopped his ministrations so that he could remove his shirt. Asuka did the same before sitting up and taking off Shinji's boxers for him, one foot at a time as they crumpled onto the floor. Asuka then laid back down but lifted her ass and hips up off the couch so that Shinji could take her panties off. Shinji grabbed the elastic band on the sides and pulled them down. As they passed her hips and began to turn inside-out they did that weirdly sexy thing where the bottom of the panties, the part that covers a woman's opening, sticks to the body for a moment before almost popping off and releasing itself. Shinji always liked to see that, it was like finding a buried gem or some other hidden treasure that fought so hard to remain secret but was finally revealed just for him.  
真嗣的亲吻让明日香浑身颤栗，双腿上布满了鸡皮疙瘩。明日香的兴奋感不断攀升，她能感受到身体受到刺激后体内燃起的炽热。真嗣察觉到明日香的内裤开始变得湿润，便松开了她的双手，停止了爱抚，以便脱下自己的衬衫。明日香也跟着做了同样的动作，然后坐起身来，逐一脱下真嗣的平角裤，它们随即皱巴巴地落在了地板上。接着，明日香又躺了回去，但抬起臀部离开了沙发，好让真嗣帮她脱掉内裤。真嗣抓住两侧的松紧带，缓缓往下拉。当内裤经过她的臀部，开始翻转时，那底部覆盖女性私密处的一片，会短暂地贴合身体，仿佛在挣扎着保持秘密，最终却还是为他揭晓，这一幕总是让真嗣觉得既奇妙又性感，宛如发掘了一颗深藏的宝石或某种隐秘的宝藏。

The red velvet and lace dropped to the floor with the rest of their clothes and they lied there on the couch looking into each other's eyes as Shinji massaged her opening with his musician's fingers. Shinji's cock was almost in agony in anticipation, the tip of his dick covered in gleaming pre-cum. He positioned his cock at her entrance and moved the cockhead slowly up and down her rapidly moistening lower lips coating the tip of his rock-hard erection in a mixture of his pre-cum and her juices.  
那件红丝绒与蕾丝的衣物随其余衣物一同滑落至地板，他们躺在沙发上，凝视着彼此的眼睛，而真嗣用他那音乐家的手指按摩着她的私密之处。真嗣的阴茎因期待而几乎感到痛苦，龟头覆盖着闪亮的预射精液。他将阴茎对准她的入口，慢慢地在其迅速湿润的下唇上来回移动，使他坚硬的阴茎尖端沾满了混合着他的预射精液和她的爱液。

"Are you ready?" Shinji asked Asuka, any sense of meekness absent from his voice. The German redhead looked up at Shinji, her back lying on the couch, her legs spread wide, and his cock pressing against her opening, waiting for a single word before beginning. She could imagine it now, his cock stroking her insides, penetrating ever deeper as his thrusts became greater and greater until reaching crescendo. As Asuka's imagination ran wild she uttered the single word she knew would make it reality:  
“准备好了吗？”真嗣问明日香，他的声音中已无半点怯懦。这位德国红发女孩仰望着真嗣，背部躺在沙发上，双腿大张，他的阴茎紧贴着她的入口，等待着一个字便开始。她现在可以想象，他的阴茎在她体内抽动，不断深入，随着他的冲刺越来越强烈，直到达到高潮。随着明日香的想象愈发狂野，她吐出了那个她知道会让一切成真的字：

"Yes." "是的。"

At her invitation, Shinji pushed his cock into her perfectly shaved pussy. He met a little resistance at her lower lips with his cockhead, but once that was overcome his whole shaft slid almost effortlessly into her wet hole. Their eyes never wavering from looking into the orbs of the other. As he hilted himself fully in Asuka he saw her bite her lip and her eyes become glazed over.  
在她邀请下，真嗣将他的阴茎插入了她完美剃净的阴部。他的龟头在她的下唇处遇到了些许阻力，但一旦克服，他的整个阴茎便几乎毫不费力地滑入了她湿润的洞穴。他们的目光始终未曾离开对方的眼睛。当他完全插入明日香体内时，他看到她咬住嘴唇，眼神变得迷离。

Shinji brought his face down to Asuka's in a passionate series of kisses. At the same time he began to move his shaft slowly back and forth and felt Asuka whimper through the kiss as he did. The slow strokes soon turned into deep and fast thrusts as the testosterone coursing in Shinji's blood demanded. Soon the apartment was filled with the smacks of his hips colliding into Asuka's. The friction between her walls of her tight pussy and his cock sending pleasure through both of their bodies.  
真嗣将脸贴近明日香，进行了一系列热情的亲吻。与此同时，他开始缓慢地前后移动他的阴茎，感受到明日香在亲吻中因他的动作而发出呜咽声。随着真嗣血液中涌动的睾酮，缓慢的抽插很快转变为深而快的挺动。不久，公寓里充满了他的臀部撞击明日香的声音。她紧致的阴部壁与他的阴茎之间的摩擦，让两人都感受到了快感。

Shinji broke the kiss and could hear Asuka's breathing hitching in response to his deep strokes. She felt the fire begin to build up in her as her body started to crave the release offered by the cock inside it.  
真嗣结束了亲吻，能听到明日香的呼吸因他的深插而变得急促。她感觉到体内的火焰开始燃烧，她的身体开始渴望那根阴茎带来的释放。

Asuka folded her legs around Shinji's back as he continued plunging his member deeper and deeper into her. Each thrust he nearly removed his cock from her before ramming the entire length back into her with the speed and intensity she loved and Shinji's lust demanded.  
明日香双腿环绕在真嗣的背上，随着他不断深入地插入，每一次冲击都几乎要将他的肉棒从她体内抽出，然后又以她所喜爱、真嗣欲望所要求的速度和强度，将整根重新猛烈地撞入她的体内。

So needless to say Asuka was momentarily surprised when Shinji stopped his thrusts, undid her legs behind his back and fully removed his engorged cock from her now achingly lonely pussy. She was about to ask him "What the fuck Ikari?!" when he reached his hands under her, grabbed her ass and began twisting her body over. 'Ah that's what he wants.' Asuka thought, a smile forming on her face as she complied with Shinji's desires and flipped over so she was on her knees and her ass was facing Shinji doggy-style.  
所以，当真嗣停止了冲击，解开她环绕在他背后的双腿，完全从她那现在空虚得令人痛苦的私处抽出他充血的肉棒时，明日香不禁一时惊讶。她正要质问：“搞什么鬼，碇真嗣？！”时，他却伸手到她身下，抓住她的臀部，开始扭动她的身体。‘啊，这就是他想要的。’明日香心想，脸上露出微笑，顺从真嗣的欲望，翻过身来，变成跪姿，翘臀对着真嗣，摆出狗爬式的姿势。

'It feels so much deeper than usual.' Asuka thought as Shinji entered her pussy with his cock, his hands on her hips guiding her onto his cock. She arched her back downwards so that her face was buried in the cushions on the couch while her hands stretched out and grabbed onto the armrest, both to prevent her head colliding with it on each thrust and to give support to her body. As Shinji kept stroking his cock into her pussy her hands gripped the armrest ever tighter and she thought she might bite through her lip to stop the moan that was building up.  
"'感觉比平时深得多。' 明日香想着，当真嗣的阴茎进入她的阴道时，他的双手放在她的臀部引导她坐上他的阴茎。她向后弓起背部，使脸埋在沙发上的垫子里，双手伸出去抓住扶手，既是为了防止每次撞击时头部撞到扶手，也是为了支撑身体。随着真嗣继续在她阴道内抽插，她的手紧紧抓住扶手，她觉得自己可能会咬穿嘴唇以阻止那逐渐升起的呻吟。

Shinji moved his hands from her hips to her ass, each hand grabbing a handful of cheek as he continued to pound away. His view was one that wouldn't be out of place in one of his fantasies. He looked down and he saw his cock sliding in and out of her perfect pussy, his hands grabbing a firm hold of her ample ass, her arched back and most of all her gorgeous locks of red hair spread out all over the couch in a rough circle emanating from her head. To top it all off Shinji heard Asuka begin to moan in pleasure as his thrusts became too much for her body to resist.  
真嗣将双手从她的臀部移到她的臀部，每只手抓住一把臀肉，继续猛烈撞击。他的视角就像是他幻想中的一幕。他低头看去，看到自己的阴茎在她完美的阴道中进进出出，双手紧紧抓住她丰满的臀部，她弓起的背部，最重要的是她那散布在沙发上、从头部向外辐射成一个粗糙圆圈的美丽红发。最让真嗣兴奋的是，他听到明日香开始发出愉悦的呻吟，他的撞击让她无法抗拒。

The fire that had started in her now felt like it was a raging inferno threatening to burn a hole straight through her. In response the walls of her pussy tightened around Shinji's cock desperately seeking more stimulation. Shinji himself was getting close to the edge himself, his balls had almost completely receded as they readied their load and burned in expectation.  
那股在她体内燃起的火焰，此刻仿佛化作了一片狂暴的火海，威胁着要将她彻底烧穿。她的私处紧紧包裹着真嗣的阴茎，急切地寻求更多的刺激。真嗣自己也快要到达极限，他的睾丸几乎完全收缩，为即将释放的精液做准备，期待中带着灼热感。

Shinji's already strong and intense thrusts became even more so as he abandoned the rhythm he had used and now each thrust became its own self-contained entity. His hips smacking into her and his shaft probing as deep as it could in an attempt to bring her over the edge. On the fourth such thrust Asuka could hold out no longer and let out a croaking moan as her walls clamped down around Shinji's member and lightning shot through her body and she shook and wiggled as her brain temporarily lost control of her muscles to the orgasm coursing through her.  
真嗣原本就强烈有力的抽插变得更加激烈，他放弃了原有的节奏，每一次挺进都成了独立的存在。他的臀部撞击着她，阴茎尽可能深入地探索，试图将她推向高潮。在第四次这样的冲击下，明日香再也坚持不住，发出一声嘶哑的呻吟，她的阴道紧紧夹住真嗣的阴茎，电流般的快感贯穿全身，她颤抖着扭动，大脑暂时失去了对肌肉的控制，任由高潮席卷全身。

While Asuka was still trembling from the intensity of her orgasm Shinji pulled his cock out of her pussy and, being at the edge of his own orgasm, shot his load onto Asuka's ass. His had also been an intense orgasm sending four or five spurts of viscous cum across Asuka's ass. Two of them ended up in splotches on her ass, but the rest melded into one big mass that was now sliding down the crack in her ass, covering her chocolate hole and drenching her labia in his cum. Shinji's semen eventually lost its battle with gravity and began dripping from Asuka's lower lips as both of them stayed in place, panting at the exertion of love-making.  
当明日香还在因高潮的强烈而颤抖时，真嗣从她的阴道中抽出自己的阴茎，正处于高潮边缘的他将精液射在了明日香的臀部上。他的高潮同样强烈，喷出了四五股粘稠的精液，覆盖在明日香的臀部。其中两股形成了斑点，其余的则融合成一大团，顺着她臀部的缝隙滑落，覆盖了她的巧克力色穴口，并浸透了她的阴唇。真嗣的精液最终不敌重力，开始从明日香的阴唇滴落，两人都停留在原地，喘息着因爱而生的疲惫。

Now Asuka usually preferred Shinji cum inside of her. But while Asuka may be a genius she hasn't yet figured out a valid excuse for why, or how Shinji's semen could possibly get into her vagina other than the obvious.  
通常，明日香更喜欢真嗣在她体内射精。但尽管明日香是个天才，她还没能找到一个合理的借口，解释真嗣的精液是如何，或者说为什么能进入她的阴道，除了显而易见的原因。

So to be safe in the week leading up their scheduled synch or medical tests Shinji didn't cum inside of her on the off chance Asuka would miss cleaning it out. Was it overkill, yeah probably, but it was a case of better safe than sorry.  
因此，在接近他们预定同步测试或医疗检查的那一周，为了安全起见，真嗣没有在她体内射精，以防明日香可能漏掉清理。这可能是过度谨慎，但总比后悔好。

As for Asuka's hymen or lack thereof, that had been handled way back. Their first time had been shortly after their battle with the 9th Angel, Matarael. While towels could be washed and condoms disposed of discreetly, unless Section 2 was looking through their cups of ramen in the trash those sick fucks. Gynecologists, or more specifically Dr. Ritsuko Akagi would have _questions_. They had thought of this with ideas ranging from it breaking during a gym class at school to Asuka pleasuring herself too hard. Asuka had even stored a vial of her blood in the freezer, from a nosebleed, in a place Shinji knew Misato would never look. But then luck, if you could call it that, threw them a bone with the 10th Angel's orbital attack and freefall.  
至于明日香是否还是处女，这个问题早已在很久以前就处理妥当。他们的第一次是在与第 9 使徒马特拉尔战斗后不久。虽然毛巾可以清洗，避孕套也能悄悄丢弃，但除非特务部二课的那帮变态从他们的拉面碗垃圾中寻找线索。妇科医生，更确切地说是赤木律子博士，可能会提出疑问。他们曾考虑过各种解释，比如在学校体育课上破裂，或是明日香自慰过度导致的。明日香甚至还在冰箱里藏了一瓶鼻血，放在一个碇真嗣知道美里绝不会去翻找的地方。但随后，如果说这是幸运的话，第 10 使徒的轨道攻击和自由落体为他们提供了一个机会。

The plan was simple, hide the frozen blood in her plugsuit, where it would melt onto her thighs and then claim the exertion of catching the angel had broken her hymen. Asuka wasn't worried about it drying out and giving away the ruse since experience told her extricating pilots from Evas was a lengthy process and besides transport to a medical facility where there was a gynecologist would likely take time.  
计划很简单，将冷冻的血液藏在她的插入栓服内，让它融化流到她的大腿上，然后声称是因为捕捉使徒时的剧烈运动导致了处女膜破裂。明日香并不担心血液干燥会暴露骗局，因为经验告诉她，从 EVA 中解救驾驶员是一个漫长的过程，而且送往有妇科医生的医疗机构也需要时间。

So after Sahaquiel had been dealt with, Shinji had caught it rather than Asuka but Tokyo-3 not being part of the Pacific Ocean was more important than the plan, and besides Asuka really _had_ exerted herself quite a lot in stabbing the core. Once the all clear had been given, Asuka had put in a call to Misato and the bridge crew in a quiet, almost timid voice, none of them had ever heard her use before, requesting medical help. A worried Misato asked Asuka what was wrong to which the reply was "_Something_ broke." Misato likely realizing what she meant made her the priority and got her to the nearest hospital ASAP.  
于是，在处理完萨哈基尔后，是真嗣而非明日香接手了后续，但东京-3 并非太平洋的一部分，这比原计划更为关键。此外，明日香在刺穿核心的过程中确实付出了相当大的努力。一旦确认安全，明日香便用一种几乎怯生生的、他们从未听过的轻柔声音，联系了美里和指挥部的成员，请求医疗援助。忧心忡忡的美里询问明日香出了什么问题，得到的回答是“有什么东西断了。”美里大概猜到了她的意思，立即将她列为优先对象，并尽快将她送往最近的医院。

All nonessential staff had been evacuated, including Ritsuko, or maybe she didn't want to risk her life on Misato's plan and its 0.00001% chance of success. So the only one on call to see Asuka had been a junior medical orderly maybe five years older than Asuka. She had really hammed it up, always acting as if on the verge of tears as she removed her plugsuit and the orderly saw her thighs covered in blood. Though before she could do a thorough examination Asuka backed away and asked to wash up. The sympathetic, and inexperienced, orderly had let her. Which was good because if she had looked then and there she would have realized there wasn't actually any blood in Asuka's vagina and something was up. Asuka came back later and had merely asked "Is it gone?" to which the orderly had nodded before filling out the update to her medical record. Thus Asuka's hymen became the only "official" casualty of the 10th Angel's attack.  
所有非必要人员均已撤离，包括律子，或许她也不愿在美里那成功率仅 0.00001%的计划上冒险。因此，唯一被指派来照看明日香的，是一位比她大约五岁的初级医疗勤务兵。她表现得相当夸张，每次脱下插头服时，总是一副泫然欲泣的模样，让勤务兵看到她大腿上沾满血迹。然而，正当勤务兵准备进行彻底检查时，明日香却退缩并要求先去清洗。那位富有同情心却缺乏经验的勤务兵同意了。这倒是件好事，因为如果当时她仔细检查，就会发现明日香阴道内其实并无血迹，事情必有蹊跷。稍后，明日香回来只问了一句：“它消失了吗？”勤务兵点头后便更新了她的医疗记录。就这样，明日香的处女膜成了第十使徒袭击中唯一的“官方”伤亡。

Misato must have been told, and feeling guilty her plan had "caused" this, because during their trip to the ramen stand for their victory meal she doted on Asuka and tried to cheer her up even suggesting they stop for ice cream on the way home before remembering she was broke. Misato's promised ice cream therefore turned out to be a shot of some very old, and expensive, sake once they returned from their "steak dinner" at the ramen stand. Later when Akagi and the other NERV staff returned, Ritsuko pulled Asuka aside and offered her condolences, Asuka didn't really remember the general cliched words she had said since the phrase "Hook, line, and sinker." Was blaring too loudly in her brain. Later that week Hikari had also gotten her the pill, and from then on they essentially had free license to do whatever and oh boy did they.  
美里肯定被告知了这一切，她为自己的计划“导致”了这样的结果而感到内疚，于是在他们去拉面摊庆祝胜利的途中，她对明日香格外关照，试图让她开心起来，甚至提议回家路上停下来买冰淇淋，却突然想起自己身无分文。因此，美里承诺的冰淇淋最终变成了一杯非常陈年且昂贵的清酒，在他们从拉面摊的“牛排晚餐”回来后兑现。后来，当赤木和其他 NERV 工作人员回来时，律子把明日香拉到一旁，向她表示慰问，明日香对那些老套的安慰话语记忆模糊，因为脑海中“上钩、上钩、彻底上钩”的念头太过响亮。那周晚些时候，光子也帮她弄到了药，从那时起，她们几乎可以随心所欲地做任何事，哦，天哪，她们确实这么做了。

Asuka was pulled out of her reminiscing at those _extremely_ pleasant memories by a light, almost playful, slap on her posterior, reminding her that she was still face down and ass up on the couch. She heard the rhythm of Shinji's chest, still heaving from their latest escapade. Asuka reached over to drawer next to the couch and pulled out a pack of wet wipes and cleaned off most of the semen covering her ass, though she would still probably need a shower later it was enough for her to sit on the couch next to Shinji. After she cleaned up the small puddle on the couch praying to every god she knew it wouldn't stain she sat down on the couch.  
那些极其愉快的记忆将明日香从回忆中拉回现实，她感到臀部被轻轻地、几乎是调皮地拍了一下，提醒她自己还脸朝下、屁股朝上地趴在沙发上。她听到真嗣胸口的节奏，他的呼吸仍因他们最近的疯狂而急促。明日香伸手从沙发旁的抽屉里拿出一包湿巾，擦掉了大部分覆盖在她屁股上的精液，尽管她可能稍后还需要洗个澡，但已经足够让她坐在真嗣旁边的沙发上了。在清理了沙发上的小水洼并祈祷她所知的每一位神明不要让这留下污渍后，她坐了下来。

Asuka curled up under Shinji's arm, her head resting on his shoulder as they sat side by side. Asuka was making little circles with her fingers on Shinji's thigh while he was using his thumb on her shoulder-blade to do the same. They were both very tactile people, always wanting to touch the other one, to know they were there, to know they were real, that they weren't going anywhere. 'Okay Sohryu you've danced around the issue long enough.'  
明日香蜷缩在真嗣的臂弯下，头靠在他的肩膀上，他们并肩坐着。明日香用手指在真嗣的大腿上画着小圈，而他则用拇指在她的肩胛骨上做着同样的动作。他们都是非常喜欢身体接触的人，总是想要触摸对方，确认对方的存在，确认他们是真实的，不会离开。'好了，惣流，你已经绕着这个问题转了很久了。'

"Did she like me?" Asuka asked. Shinji knew what she meant as his mind recalled standing in the graveyard earlier that day with his father, Gendo Ikari. She had been worried, not because she really thought Shinji's mom would be looking down from heaven and give Shinji her telepathic approval or not, but instead because Shinji was facing his demons. Something she, with all her strength and genius still had trouble with.  
"她喜欢我吗？" 明日香问道。真嗣明白她的意思，他的脑海中浮现出当天早些时候与父亲源堂在墓地里的情景。她之所以担心，并不是因为她真的认为真嗣的母亲会从天堂俯视并给予他心灵上的认可与否，而是因为真嗣正在面对自己的心魔。尽管她拥有力量与天才，但在这方面依然感到困扰。

"She's not there it's just a marker, a memorial." His face darkening at the response and the memory of what his father said before his expression softened and he continued, "But there's no better place to go to tell her. So I let her know about you, about how I'm happy now like when she was with me." Shinji finished with a small smile and a squeeze to the redhead's shoulder.  
"那里只是个标记，一个纪念碑。" 他的脸色因这个回答和父亲的记忆而变得阴沉，但随后表情缓和下来，继续说道，"但那里是告诉她的最佳地点。所以我让她知道了你，告诉她我现在很幸福，就像她还在我身边时一样。" 真嗣说完，露出一丝微笑，轻轻捏了捏红发女孩的肩膀。

"I wish I knew what she was like. What she looked like." Asuka responded in a quiet voice. Since their relationship had started they had both opened up about their pasts and the tragedies that lie within. Their mothers, their loneliness, constant searching for purpose and belonging.  
"我真希望知道她是什么样的人，她长什么样。" 明日香轻声回应。自从他们开始这段关系以来，两人都敞开了心扉，谈及过去的经历和其中的悲剧。他们的母亲，他们的孤独，不断寻找着目的和归属感。

"There are no pictures anymore. My father got rid of them all. To forget." Shinji answered with a hint of sadness in his voice. While his father may deal with pain by shuttering it away and disposing of everything that could remind him of it, Shinji had learned with Asuka that you have to face the world's slings and arrows if you were ever to be free, ever to be happy.  
"再也没有照片了。我父亲把它们全处理掉了。为了遗忘。" 真嗣回答时，声音中带着一丝悲伤。尽管他的父亲可能通过封闭情感并丢弃一切能提醒他的东西来应对痛苦，但真嗣在与明日香一起学会了，如果你想获得自由，想变得快乐，就必须面对世界的打击。

"Asshole, thinking only of himself and his own pain." Asuka bitterly replied even as she wrapped her arms around Shinji's chest in a sign of comfort and support.  
"混蛋，只想着他自己和他的痛苦。" 明日香苦涩地回应，尽管她用双臂环抱住真嗣的胸膛，以示安慰和支持。

"Worst part is thinking back, I can't even remember what she looked like. Just the sense of a smile." Shinji said in a melancholic voice as he dug up the memory of mother and found that even the smile was fading.  
"最糟糕的是回想起来，我甚至记不清她的样子。只记得一种微笑的感觉。" 真嗣用忧郁的声音说道，他挖掘着关于母亲的记忆，却发现连那个微笑也在逐渐消逝。

"Ironic. You can't remember your mother's face…" Asuka said before turning her head and burying her head as far into Shinji's chest as it would go before continuing "…but I can't forget mine." Her voice becoming very quiet as the image of a smiling face hanging from a ceiling flashed through her mind as Shinji felt her body shudder at the dark memory.  
“真是讽刺。你记不清你母亲的脸……”明日香说着，扭过头，将脸深深埋进真嗣的胸膛，继续道，“……但我却忘不了。”她的声音变得非常轻，脑海中闪过一张挂在天花板上的笑脸，真嗣感觉到她的身体因那段黑暗的记忆而颤抖。

Shinji felt the wetness on his chest and he knew tears were forming in Asuka's eyes. He twisted his body around and grabbed Asuka's shoulders pulling her up, gently wiping away the barely formed tears from her closed eyelids.  
真嗣感到胸口湿漉漉的，知道明日香的眼中涌出了泪水。他转过身，抓住明日香的肩膀将她拉起，轻轻拭去她紧闭眼睑上刚形成的泪珠。

Asuka opened her eyes and saw Shinji's stern look of determination as he wrapped his arms around her in a comforting embrace. Her head resting on his shoulder as her hands, constrained by Shinji's hug as they were absently played with his chest. She remained there, Shinji's arms felt so strong despite being so scrawny. The safety and security they offered soothing away the pain of nearly a decade of nightmares.  
明日香睁开眼，看到真嗣坚定的严肃表情，他张开双臂，给予她一个安慰的拥抱。她的头靠在他的肩上，双手被真嗣的拥抱所限制，无意识地在他胸前摆弄。她就这样待着，尽管真嗣身材瘦削，但他的臂膀却显得异常有力。那份安全感与保护感，抚平了近十年来噩梦带来的痛苦。

It reminded Asuka of the epiphany she had had after Mt. Asama, about men, about Shinji. They aren't testosterone fueled studs, they are the ones who when push comes to shove, they do what they need to. That's why she had talked to him…why she had kissed him…why she had opened her heart to him afterwards.  
这让她想起了在浅间山之后的那次顿悟，关于男人，关于真嗣。他们不是被睾丸素驱动的猛男，而是在紧要关头，他们会做必须做的事。这就是为什么她会和他交谈……为什么她会吻他……为什么事后她会向他敞开心扉。

They stayed like that for a while, basking in each other's presence, letting their cares melt away. Until they heard the hissing sound of the freezer door being opened. Pen-Pen waddled across the living room towards the kitchen and a deliciously intoxicating can of beer. On his return trip he paused and looked at the two lovers, lying on the couch. He didn't "wark" or really even make a clear expression, he just looked at them with a blank face, or what passes for a blank face on a warm-water penguin, before returning to his freezer beer in hand. This whole exchange cause Asuka to look at the clock and realize the time. While Misato hadn't specified when or if she would be back tonight it paid to be cautious. So with very little enthusiasm in her voice Asuka broke the comfortable silence:  
他们就这样待了一会儿，沉浸在彼此的存在中，让烦恼渐渐消散。直到他们听到冰箱门被打开的嘶嘶声。Pen-Pen 摇摇摆摆地穿过客厅走向厨房，那里有一罐诱人陶醉的啤酒。在他返回的路上，他停了下来，看着躺在沙发上的两位恋人。他没有“哇”地叫，甚至没有明显表情，只是面无表情地看着他们，或者说，对于一只温水企鹅来说，那算是面无表情，然后手里拿着啤酒回到了冰箱。这一连串的互动让明日香看了一眼时钟，意识到时间。虽然美里没有明确说明今晚是否会回来，但谨慎行事总是好的。于是，明日香用几乎没有热情的声音打破了舒适的沉默：

"I better go wash up now." Asuka said getting up from the couch and heading towards the bathroom. A nice hot shower was always something she enjoyed, though especially after coitus and emotionally demanding days. As she was showering she faintly heard the hiss of the front door opening and muted voices through the walls.  
“我还是先去洗个澡吧。”明日香说着从沙发上起身，朝浴室走去。她总是喜欢享受一场热腾腾的淋浴，尤其是在激情过后和情绪消耗巨大的日子里。当她在淋浴时，隐约听到前门打开的嘶嘶声和透过墙壁传来的低沉人声。

'Phew. Good idea there Sohryu in going to the shower when you did.' She shut off the water and grabbed a towel as she heard the voices come closer. Through the bathroom doors and walls she heard snippets of the conversation "…ood to see you." "She'll be alright." "…lay her down.". As they went past the bathroom towards Misato's room. Asuka could put two and two together and realized Misato must be horrendously drunk and Kaji brought her home.  
“呼，还好你及时去洗澡了，惣流。”她关掉水，拿起毛巾，听到声音越来越近。透过浴室门和墙壁，她听到了几句对话：“……很高兴见到你。”“她会没事的。”“……把她放下。”他们经过浴室，朝美里房间走去。明日香能猜到，美里一定是醉得一塌糊涂，而加持把她送回了家。

'What an excellent opportunity.' Asuka thought a devilish plan forming in her brain as she put the towel on, opened the door, and ran to catch Kaji in the doorway.  
“真是天赐良机。”明日香心中暗想，一个狡猾的计划在她脑海中形成。她裹上毛巾，打开门，跑去门口截住加持。

"Won't you stay Kaji?" Asuka said as she ran down the corridor in her towel before clinging to his arm. She smelt Misato's perfume on him, but figured it was either from him carrying her or maybe something more…frisky. She filed that away for later, her goal now was to convince Kaji and additionally anyone he talked to that she was still crushing on him and definitely not having copious amounts of sex with Shinji.  
"你不留下来吗，加持？" 明日香一边说着，一边裹着毛巾在走廊上奔跑，随后紧紧抱住他的手臂。她闻到他身上有美里小姐的香水味，但心想可能是他抱她时沾上的，或者也许是更...调情的事情。她决定稍后再考虑这个问题，现在她的目标是说服加持，以及任何他可能交谈的人，她仍然对他有好感，绝对没有和真嗣发生大量性行为。

Despite knowing it was a ruse Shinji still had a pang of jealousy in his heart as he saw Asuka fawn and drape herself over Kaji in nothing but a towel.  
尽管知道这是一场戏，真嗣看到明日香只裹着一条毛巾，对加持撒娇并依偎在他身上时，心中仍感到一阵嫉妒。

"I don't have a change of work-clothes Asuka." Kaji said in his particular unflappable and charming way as he extricated himself from Asuka's grasp being careful to not touch any of the goods. Asuka toyed with the idea of letting the towel drop to really sell the subterfuge she was attempting but quickly discarded it as a step too far.  
"我没有换洗的工作服，明日香。" 加持以他特有的沉着和迷人的方式说道，同时小心翼翼地从明日香的怀抱中脱身，避免触碰到任何敏感部位。明日香曾想过让毛巾掉下来，以更好地掩饰她正在进行的伪装，但很快认为这步子迈得太大了。

"But Kaji it's so boring here with this baka! I want a real man!" Asuka said in her most pouty voice. If it wouldn't give the game up Shinji would have rolled his eyes at her statement. Wait did he and not realize it? He wasn't sure and couldn't remember. How do you forget what you did or didn't do ten seconds ago?  
“但是加持，和这个笨蛋在一起这里太无聊了！我想要一个真正的男人！”明日香用她最撒娇的语气说道。如果不是会暴露游戏，真嗣早就对她的话翻白眼了。等等，是他而不是他吗？他不确定，也想不起来。你怎么会忘记十秒钟前做了或没做什么呢？

Kaji merely gave a slight smile and headed towards the door, jacket draped over his back.  
加持只是微微一笑，走向门口，夹克搭在背上。

"Goodbye Shinji, goodbye Asuka. Take care of Misato." Kaji said in his signature tranquil voice with a grin on his unshaven face as the front door shut between them.  
“再见，真嗣，再见，明日香。照顾好美里。”加持用他标志性的平静声音说道，脸上带着未刮胡子的笑容，前门在他们之间关上了。

"You don't think you overdid it a little?" Shinji asked Asuka after a moment.  
"你不觉得有点过头了吗？" 真嗣在片刻后问明日香。

"It had to be convincing baka!" Asuka said in a voice more like how she talked to him at school, harsh and critical. She turned to look him in the eyes before continuing, "Besides…" she placed a hand on his cheek before continuing in the her soft, warm voice that was reserved for pillow talk "…you know how much I love you."  
"必须得让人信服，笨蛋！" 明日香用一种更像在学校里对他说话的严厉和挑剔的语气说道。她转过身来直视他的眼睛，然后继续说，"再说了……" 她把手放在他的脸颊上，用她那温柔、温暖的枕边细语继续道，"……你知道我有多爱你。"

Shinji reached up and caressed the hand on his cheek before responding.  
真嗣伸手轻抚着她放在他脸颊上的手，然后回应道。

"I love you too Asuka." Shinji said with a smile on his face, the jealousy forgotten as he stared into the cerulean orbs of his lover and saw only love there in the windows of her soul. He leaned over to her and they shared a long, loving kiss, their arms wrapping around each other, the breath from his nose tickling her as they shared this moment. But eventually it had to end.  
"我也爱你，明日香。" 真嗣微笑着说道，嫉妒之情已被抛诸脑后，他凝视着恋人那蔚蓝的眼眸，在那灵魂的窗扉中只看到了爱意。他倾身向她，两人深情地拥吻，双臂环绕着彼此，他的鼻息轻拂过她的脸颊，共享着这一刻。但最终，这甜蜜的时刻不得不结束。

"Good night Shinji." Asuka said as the kiss ended and she turned and headed to her room.  
"晚安，真嗣。" 明日香在吻别后说道，转身走向自己的房间。

"Good night Asuka." Shinji replied as he watched her head down the hallway before sighing and going to bed himself.  
"晚安，明日香。" 真嗣回应道，目送她走向走廊尽头，然后叹了口气，自己也准备就寝。

**Several Days Later. Women's Locker Room. NERV.  
数日后。NERV 女性更衣室。**

"That Bastard!" Asuka screamed as she slammed her hand into the nearest locker before continuing. "He beat us so easily. To be honest, getting beat that easily is a little frustrating, don't you think?" Asuka continued as Rei silently changed out of her plugsuit and into her school uniform. The irony that both Asuka and Shinji had scored all time highs and that he had only edged her out by 0.7% was lost on the Great Asuka Langley Sohryu and her pride. "The great invincible Shinji! This just means we get to take it easy now, right? But I guess we should at least do our best not to be left behind." Asuka finished as she raised another fist to strike at a fresh, innocent locker.  
“那个混蛋！”明日香尖叫着，一拳砸向最近的更衣柜，继续说道，“他那么轻易就打败了我们。说实话，这么轻易被打败真是有点让人沮丧，你不觉得吗？”明日香继续说着，而绫波零默默地从插入栓服换成了校服。讽刺的是，她和真嗣都取得了历史最高分，而他仅以 0.7%的优势超过她，这对伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷来说，她的骄傲并未察觉到这一点。“无敌的真嗣！这只不过意味着我们现在可以轻松一点了，对吧？但我想我们至少应该尽力不被甩在后面。”明日香说完，又举起另一只拳头，准备砸向一个无辜的新更衣柜。

"Goodbye." Rei said quietly as she left the locker room, leaving Asuka alone with her thoughts. The raised fist unfolded and the locker, if it had been sentient, would have given a sigh of relief at being spared a dent in its body.  
“再见。”绫波轻声说道，离开了更衣室，留下明日香独自沉思。那只举起的拳头慢慢展开，如果那更衣柜有知觉，一定会松一口气，庆幸自己免于被砸出一个凹痕。

'I am so going to blue-ball him later for this.' Asuka thought to herself, though she wasn't sure of that thought's actual sincerity as she started to unzip her own plugsuit. 'That baka.' She thought as her plugsuit fell to the floor. She still couldn't help smiling when she thought of him though, his friendly face and cobalt eyes. Her old self would have been absolutely livid with the Third Child for beating her and wounding her pride. But now Asuka was merely annoyed, her identity no longer based around the praise of others or herself, instead her thoughts focused on how to make Shinji's balls beg and burn for release as long as possible.  
“我待会儿一定要让他尝尝欲求不满的滋味。”明日香暗自思忖，尽管她不确定这个念头是否真心实意，因为她已经开始解开自己的驾驶服拉链。“那个笨蛋。”她想着，驾驶服滑落在地。尽管如此，每当想起他，她还是忍不住微笑，他那友善的面庞和深蓝色的眼睛。过去的她绝对会因为第三适格者击败她、伤了她的自尊而暴跳如雷。但现在，明日香只是有些恼火，她的自我认同不再依赖于他人的赞誉或自我评价，而是专注于如何让真嗣的欲望长时间地煎熬、求而不得。

'You're in for it now Shinji.' Asuka said closing the locker and heading out.  
“这下你可有得受了，真嗣。”明日香说着，关上储物柜的门，走了出去。

**Later. 后来。**

"Combat is a man's job!" Shinji said with highly uncharacteristic confidence as he assumed the point position against the latest Angel to arrive in Tokyo-3. A zebra-striped orb the Magi had next to no information about other than "Yep, something's there."  
"战斗是男人的工作！" 真嗣带着异常自信的语气说道，他站在最前线迎战最新出现在东京-3 的天使。这个斑马条纹的球体，MAGI 对其几乎一无所知，只知道"没错，那里确实有东西。"

'Bastard. This must be for last night.' Asuka thought absently as she began to move into position to support Shinji. "If you want to finish then go to the shower!" She had said after torturing him, bringing him to the edge of release before stopping.  
'混蛋。这肯定是为了昨晚的事。' 明日香心不在焉地想着，开始移动位置以支援真嗣。"如果你想结束，那就去洗澡吧！" 她在昨晚折磨他时说道，让他几乎达到高潮却又突然停下。

"Damn it." Asuka said as her power umbilical got hung up on a building and she hurriedly swapped it out for a new one.  
"该死。" 明日香说道，她的电源缆线被建筑物挂住，她急忙换上了一条新的。

"Asuka are you in position yet?" Shinji asked over the comm.  
"明日香，你到位了吗？" 真嗣通过通讯器问道。

"Not yet." Asuka responded as she placed in the new power cable and resumed moving. After another few moments Asuka was overlooking the 12th Angel, codenamed Leliel. The plan was for Shinji to fire on the Angel with his over-sized pistol, hopefully attracting its attention so that Asuka could jump out and get a clean shot with her axe. If that didn't neutralize the Angel then maybe it would get its attention enough so it could be drawn out of the city so that the accountants at NERV's already way overbudget collateral damage department wouldn't be on suicide watch after this battle.  
"还没呢。" 明日香回应着，一边插入新的电源线，一边继续移动。片刻之后，她俯瞰着被称为 Leliel 的第 12 使徒。计划是让真嗣用他那超大号手枪向使徒射击，希望能吸引其注意力，这样明日香就能跳出来，用她的斧头给使徒一个干净利落的打击。如果这还不能使使徒失去战斗力，那么至少能吸引它的注意力，将其引出城市，以免 NERV 的预算早已超支的附带损害部门会计们在战斗后陷入自杀监视状态。

"In position baka, on your mark." The Second Child said as she crouched atop a building for cover.  
"到位了，笨蛋，等你信号。" 第二适格者说着，蹲在一栋建筑的顶上作为掩护。

The eerie silence of the city was broken as three shots rang out and bullets the size of artillery shells flew through the air toward their target. At the same time Unit-02 jumped into the sky, axe held high to bring it down on the orb just after the rounds impacted. But as Asuka was in flight she saw the orb disappear before her very eyes.  
城市的诡异寂静被三声枪响打破，炮弹般大小的子弹划破空气，直奔目标而去。与此同时，二号机一跃而起，高举战斧，准备在弹丸击中光球后立即劈下。但就在明日香腾空之际，她亲眼目睹那光球在她眼前消失无踪。

"What the-" Asuka started as she did a double flip to land on top of a nearby building just as she heard Shinji scream as a black shadow appeared under his feet and began to suck him in. Though not just him but all the nearby buildings began to sink as well.  
“什——”明日香话音未落，便一个后空翻落在附近一栋建筑顶上，恰在此时听到真嗣的尖叫，一个黑影在他脚下浮现，开始将他吞噬。不仅如此，周围的所有建筑也开始随之沉陷。

"Shinji!" Asuka said as Shinji unloaded the rest of his pistol into the shadow that was slowly consuming him. Unit-02 jumped across the buildings like a frog using stones to cross a stream and landed on the building next to Unit-01. She grabbed its hand with one of hers while she swung her axe down into the shadow only for it to get stuck immediately. She let go of the now stuck axe and instead pulled on Unit-01's hand with both of hers. So focused was Asuka on this task that she missed the fact that the building she was standing on had fully sunk into the shadow and now her Eva's own feet were now sinking.  
"真嗣！" 明日香喊道，真嗣正将手枪剩余的子弹全部射向那慢慢吞噬他的阴影。二号机如同青蛙跳石过溪般跃过建筑，落在零一机旁。她用一只手抓住零一机的手，同时挥斧劈向阴影，却立刻卡住了。她松开卡住的斧头，转而用双手拉住零一机的手。明日香如此专注于这项任务，以至于她没注意到自己站立的建筑已完全沉入阴影，现在她的 EVA 双脚也开始下沉。

"Asuka!" Shinji said just as Unit-01's entry plug descended below the plane of the shadow.  
"明日香！" 真嗣喊道，就在零一机的插入栓沉入阴影平面之下时。

"Misato! Misato! Hel-" Asuka screamed in vain. Still desperately holding on as her own Eva submerged into the opaque depths.  
"美里！美里！救命——" 明日香徒劳地尖叫着。她仍拼命坚持，自己的 EVA 却逐渐沉入不透明的深渊。

"Rei. Pull back." The normally tough Misato said in a shaky voice as the Magi reported no trace of either of her charges.  
“丽，撤退。”平日里坚强的美里用颤抖的声音说道，因为 MAGI 报告说她的两个被监护人踪迹全无。

**Some Time Later 一段时间后**

"There is nothing on any of the sensors. No radar, lidar, visual, audio or radio contact. Hell not even any sonar or spectrographic contacts. It's literal nothingness." The Second Child Asuka Langley Sohryu said as she ran through the checklist one more time in her head before looking at the one piece of data she did have "Except that." Asuka continued as she looked at the red blinking light in the entry plug denoting pressure being exerted on the Unit's left hand. "Which means.."  
"“所有传感器上都没有任何信号。雷达、激光雷达、视觉、音频或无线电联系，甚至连声纳或光谱联系都没有。简直就是一片虚无。”第二适格者惣流·明日香·兰格雷一边在脑海中再次过了一遍检查清单，一边看着她唯一拥有的数据，“除了那个。”明日香继续说道，目光停留在插入栓内表示初号机左手受到压力的红灯上。“这意味着……”

"…she's there." Shinji said looking at the reading on the pressure pad on his Eva's left hand. While he wasn't as versed in the workings of Eva units as Asuka or Ritsuko he knew enough to determine that his and Asuka's Evas were in this place, if you could call it that, together. He'd tried contacting her on the radio but to no avail. No signals were getting through.  
"…她就在那里。" 真嗣看着 Eva 左手压力垫上的读数说道。虽然他对 Eva 机体的了解不及明日香或律子，但他足以判断出他和明日香的 Eva 都在这个地方，如果这能称之为地方的话，一起。他尝试通过无线电联系她，但毫无效果。没有任何信号能传出去。

"Baka. I hope you've switched over to emergency power, that ought to give us some time for NERV to come up with a plan to save us." Asuka said trying to keep out the twinge of doubt that told her this was the end from her mind.  
"笨蛋。希望你已经切换到紧急电源了，那样应该能为我们争取一些时间，让 NERV 想出救我们的计划。" 明日香试图将心中那丝告诉她这可能是终结的疑虑排除在外。

"So sleepy." Both pilots said in near unison as they curled up in their entry plugs and dozed off.  
"好困。" 两位驾驶员几乎同时说道，他们在插入栓中蜷缩起来，渐渐入睡。

_**Oh? Two of you? How interesting.  
哦？你们两位？真有意思。**_

"Who's that." Shinji Ikari said in a daze. As far as he could tell he was on a train. The train was empty, save for himself and Asuka who he could see on the opposite side of the train diagonal to him, as well as what looked to be a younger version of himself across from him dressed in what appeared to be zebra striped clothes. That meant something but Shinji wasn't sure why he thought that confused as he was.  
“那是谁？”碇真嗣恍惚地说道。就他所见，自己正身处一列火车上。火车空无一人，除了他和对面斜对角的明日香，还有坐在他对面、穿着斑马条纹衣服的、看起来像是年幼版的自己。这应该意味着什么，但真嗣此时困惑不已，不确定为何会有这种想法。

_**We are Shinji Ikari and Asuka Langley Sohryu.  
我们是碇真嗣和惣流·明日香·兰格雷。**_

"That's bullshit! I'm me!" It was Asuka's turn to speech and she took a much more combative tone to the situation they found themselves in. It was now that Shinji noticed there was also a younger version of Asuka across from her also dressed in clothes with zebra stripes.  
"简直是胡说八道！我就是我！" 轮到明日香发言了，她对当前的处境采取了更具攻击性的语气。直到这时，真嗣才注意到对面还有一个穿着斑马条纹衣服的年轻版明日香。

_**We are you. The self incorporates another self. The self has always been composed of two selves.  
我们就是你。自我包含另一个自我。自我始终由两个自我组成。**_

"Two?" Shinji responded in a meek and bewildered voice trying to make sense of the situation.  
"两个？" 真嗣用一种怯懦而困惑的声音回应，试图理解当前的情况。

_**Yes the self which is observed by others, and the self which observes itself. To expound the self that is you is different from the self that exists in the other's mind.  
是的，那个被他人观察到的自我，以及那个自我观察的自我。阐述存在于你心中的自我与他人心中所存在的自我是不同的。**_

"Different?" Shinji said as he looked over at where Asuka was sitting. Only now noticing both she and he were in their school uniforms and not their plugsuits, which seemed weird to Shinji but he couldn't quite place why.  
“不同？”真嗣说着，目光转向坐在一旁的明日香。直到这时他才注意到，她和自己都穿着校服而不是插入栓服，这让他感到有些奇怪，但又说不出具体原因。

"So the idea of Shinji I have in my mind isn't the real Shinji?" He heard Asuka ask their enigmatic interlocutor.  
“所以，我心中对真嗣的印象并不是真正的真嗣吗？”他听到明日香向那位神秘的对话者问道。

_**No. Both are true selves, yet both are unique and able to be changed.  
不，两者都是真实的自我，但各自独特且能够被改变。**_

"Changed?" Asuka asked. Shinji noticed her own voice was weak as well after her earlier outburst and she wasn't moving except for her lips as she talked. Come to think of it he couldn't move either. This was strange.  
“改变？”明日香问道。真嗣注意到她自己的声音也因之前的爆发而显得虚弱，除了嘴唇在说话外，她几乎一动不动。说来奇怪，他自己也无法动弹。

_**Yes. Both of the selves that exist in the other's mind have changed much over the time you have known each other.  
是的。在你们相识的这段时间里，彼此心中的两个自我都经历了许多变化。**_

'What do they mean.' Both pilots thought simultaneously.  
“它们是什么意思。”两位飞行员同时想到。

_**From your first impressions.  
从你的第一印象来看。**_

"Strong. Confident. Fiery. Arrogant"  
“强大。自信。炽热。傲慢”

"Meek. A doormat. Baka. Pervert."  
"温顺。任人踩踏的垫子。笨蛋。变态。"

_**To your first victory together against Israfael.  
为你们共同对抗伊斯拉斐尔的首胜干杯。**_

"Still a child herself. Determined but vulnerable."  
"她自己仍是个孩子。坚定但脆弱。"

"Still a meek pervert. Afraid of being hated."  
"依旧是个胆小的变态。害怕被讨厌。"

_**To now. 直到现在。**_

"Confident. Love. Passion. Caring."  
"自信。爱。激情。关怀。"

"Determined. Love. Baka. Protective."  
"坚定。爱。笨蛋。保护欲。"

_**When did you stop being afraid of being hurt? How did these feelings develop?  
你何时不再害怕受伤？这些情感是如何萌生的？**_

"She kissed me."  "她吻了我。"

"I kissed him." "我吻了他。"

_The memory played before them. It was after Mt. Asama. They were still at the hot springs resort Misato had decided to take them to as a reward for all their hard work. Said guardian was taking a shower after the last round in the springs. So Asuka decided to take this chance to ask the question that had been nagging at her. She dressed in her striped bikini and cornered a toweled Shinji in a secluded spot and asked:  
记忆在他们面前重现。那是在浅间山之后，他们还在美里决定带他们去的温泉度假村，作为对他们辛勤工作的奖励。那位监护人正在洗浴，因为这是他们在温泉的最后一轮。于是，明日香决定抓住这个机会，问出一直困扰她的问题。她穿着条纹比基尼，在一个隐蔽的角落堵住了裹着毛巾的 Shinji，问道：_

"_Why did you save me?" The question hung between the two pilots, seemingly stifling the air around them until Shinji offered a response in his meek voice._  
"你为什么要救我？" 这个问题悬在两位驾驶员之间，似乎压抑了周围的空气，直到 Shinji 用他那怯懦的声音给出了回应。

"_I couldn't let you die. Not while there was something I could do about it."_  
"我不能让你死，只要我还能做些什么。"

"_Why not let me fall into the volcano and then you could have Misato, Rei, and everyone else to yourself. And no one would hate you because you were just following orders."Asuka asked, her tone accusatory and inquisitive._  
"为什么不让我掉进火山里，然后你就可以独占美里、丽和大家。而且没人会恨你，因为你只是在服从命令。"明日香质问着，语气中带着指责和探究。

"_I couldn't live with myself if I did that." Shinji said raising his voice in response before continuing "I did it because I don't like seeing other people get hurt." He said his face becoming serious, determined, like it had been at the climax of their fight with the 6__th_ _Angel._  
"如果我那样做了，我无法面对自己。"真嗣提高声音回应，接着说："我这么做是因为我不希望看到别人受伤。"他的表情变得严肃而坚定，就像他们在与第六使徒战斗的高潮时那样。

"_Close your eyes."Asuka said with a frown on her face and Shinji had wondered what punishment he would get for daring to save someone as prideful as Sohryu._  
“闭上眼睛。”明日香皱着眉头说道，而真嗣则在想，他竟敢救了像惣流这样骄傲的人，会受到什么惩罚。

'_No matter what I do everyone will always ha-' Shinji's thoughts were interrupted by lightning flowing through his body emanating from his lips. His eyes popped open in surprise to confirm what his other senses told him to see Asuka Langley Sohryu, eyes closed and kissing him. Shinji couldn't think, he just stood there barely able to absorb what was happening. His hands instinctively went to her sides, carefully avoiding any of the merchandise but still feeling her soft creamy skin beneath his hands as they drew her closer as he closed his eyes and took in the moment._  
“无论我做什么，大家总是会——”真嗣的思绪被流经身体的电流打断，这电流从他的唇间散发出来。他的眼睛惊讶地睁开，确认他的其他感官所告诉他的景象：明日香·兰格雷，闭着眼睛，正吻着他。真嗣无法思考，只是站在那里，几乎无法吸收正在发生的事情。他的手本能地伸向她的两侧，小心翼翼地避开任何商品，但仍能感受到她柔软的奶油色肌肤，随着他闭上眼睛，将她拉近，沉浸在这一刻。

_They stayed like that for an untold moment. Until Sohryu broke the kiss and Shinji's hands returned to his side. Both shyly avoiding looking in each other's eyes  
他们就这样停留了不知多久。直到惣流结束了这个吻，真嗣的手也回到了他的身边。两人都害羞地避开对方的目光。_

"_Why?...why did you do that?" Shinji managed to ask as he brought his cobalt eyes up to look into her cerulean spheres._  
“为什么……你为什么要这么做？” 真嗣勉强问道，将他那湛蓝的眼睛抬起，与她天蓝色的眸子对视。

"_I…I…" Asuka began her cheeks a burning red blush a shade darker than her hair before turning around and beginning to run away but not before pausing for a moment to look back at Shinji and blow him another kiss._  
“我……我……” 明日香开口说道，双颊泛起比她发色还要深的绯红，转身开始跑开，但在离开前停顿了一下，回头向真嗣又送了一个飞吻。

'Looking back. I don't know what overcame me in that moment. It was like my body was on autopilot making its own decisions.' Sohryu thought as she replayed the events in her mind.  
“回想起那一刻，我不知道是什么驱使了我。仿佛我的身体自动导航，自行做出了决定。” 惣流心想，脑海中重演着那一幕。

_**What came first? The change of yourself in your own mind or the change in the perception of you he had?  
究竟是先改变了你自己的内心，还是他对你看法的改变先发生？**_

"I don't know. I'm still so confused about how it happened. It seemed I was living in a dream. Before it I was one way and after it I was different." Ikari answered.  
"我不知道。我仍然对这一切是如何发生的感到困惑。仿佛我生活在一场梦中。之前我是那样，之后我却变得不同了。" 碇回答道。

"They blur together. Love is like when you mix paints together, the line where it stops being one color and changes into another is hard to see. You know it is there but cannot point to any single place to say where it begins. Looking back I can't say where I began to love Shinji, If it was before or after the volcano."  
"它们交织在一起。爱情就像混合颜料，从一种颜色过渡到另一种颜色的界限难以察觉。你知道它存在，却无法指出具体从哪里开始。回望过去，我无法确定我是在火山爆发前还是后开始爱上真嗣的。"

"But I don't regret it for one moment. We're **alive** now. She loves me, she cares for me, she showed me that happiness can be found in this world if I accept the world and the people in it. I love her for breaking me out of my shell of self-loathing and self-deception."  
"但我一刻也不后悔。我们现在还活着。她爱我，她关心我，她让我明白，如果我接受这个世界和其中的人们，就能在这个世界上找到幸福。我爱她，因为她让我走出了自我厌恶和自我欺骗的壳。"

"He loves me for simply being Asuka. That is enough. If he can love me for being Asuka, then I can also love myself, not for being the best, but for simply being Asuka."  
"他爱我只是因为我是明日香。这就足够了。如果他能因为我就是明日香而爱我，那么我也能爱自己，不是因为我是最好的，而是仅仅因为我是明日香。"

_**Hmm. So love, of oneself and others, is the way to weave a path to the way one reaches the light.  
嗯。所以，爱自己和他人才是通往光明之路的途径。**_

"If you want to be needlessly poetic and unoriginal then yes." Asuka answered, a bit of her old fire sneaking into her voice.  
"如果你想无谓地追求诗意和缺乏新意，那么是的。" 明日香回答道，一丝她往日的锋芒悄然溜进了她的声音。

_**In that case. Who said "I love you" first?  
那么，是谁先说的“我爱你”？**_

"That…" "那个…"

_It was at the NERV swimming pool. After that first kiss both were dancing around the other. They talked differently than before, less constrained, more open about their true thoughts and feelings. They had kissed more since the first time. Occasionally passionately and deeply, Shinji even fondled her breast once when he was particularly bold earning a slap, followed by a kiss to "Make it feel better". Needless to say both were aware of the growing feelings between them but their past traumas were still holding back the words.  
事情发生在 NERV 的游泳池边。自那第一次亲吻后，两人都开始绕着对方转。他们的对话与以往不同，不再那么拘束，更愿意坦露真实的想法和感受。自初次接吻以来，他们又有了几次亲吻，有时激情而深入，甚至有一次真嗣特别大胆地抚摸了她的胸部，结果挨了一巴掌，随后又被一个吻安慰道：“让它感觉好些”。不用说，两人都察觉到了彼此间日益增长的情感，但过去的创伤仍让他们难以启齿。_

_During one of their now civil conversations, Asuka had discovered Shinji couldn't swim, so she decided she should teach him.  
在一次平和的交谈中，明日香发现真嗣不会游泳，于是她决定应该教他。_

_She was wearing her striking and probably too revealing red and white striped bikini and he was in a new pair of blue swimming trunks.  
她穿着那件引人注目、或许过于暴露的红白条纹比基尼，而他则换上了一条新的蓝色泳裤。_

_Rei was gone, somewhere else, not sure where. So they had the pool all to themselves. Starting with floating and doggy-paddling they eventually got to a part of the pool where their feet couldn't touch the bottom.  
丽已经离开了，不知去了哪里。于是他们独享了整个泳池。从漂浮和狗刨开始，他们最终来到了一个脚触不到池底的地方。_

_Shinji was absolutely terrified, he would have quit long before if Asuka hadn't been there with him. Asuka caught herself touching and holding Shinji much more than necessary to keep him above water. Her hands gingerly stroking across his body feeling his skin, the Third child seemingly oblivious to what she was really doing.  
真嗣完全吓坏了，如果不是有明日香在身边，他早就放弃了。明日香发现自己触碰和扶持真嗣的次数远超必要，她的手小心翼翼地抚过他的身体，感受着他的肌肤，第三适格者似乎并未察觉到她的真实意图。_

"_You know I still don't understand why people like swimming. Humans weren't made to float." Shinji remarked as his head again bobbed below the surface only to be pushed up by Asuka's shepherding presence._  
“你知道吗，我还是不明白为什么人们喜欢游泳。人类生来就不是为了漂浮的。”真嗣说道，他的头再次沉入水面，随即被明日香守护的身影推了上来。

"_Baka. Because it's fun." Asuka said having just savored another long firm hold of Shinji's body as she had pushed him up by the chest and stomach, her hand had been precariously close to his crotch and had they not been covered in water Asuka would have noticed the nervous sweat on Shinji's brow._  
"笨蛋。因为很有趣。" 明日香说道，刚刚又享受了一次对真嗣身体的长时间紧抱，她将他推起，手按在他的胸口和腹部，位置险些触及他的胯部，如果不是被水覆盖，明日香本该注意到真嗣额头上紧张的汗水。

_Shinji's head bobbed under the water again and Asuka she wasn't sure whether it was a fluke or her subconscious was extra bold but her hand brushed against Shinji's crotch.  
真嗣的头再次沉入水中，明日香不确定这是偶然还是她的潜意识格外大胆，但她的手确实触碰到了真嗣的胯部。_

_And he was hard. 而他硬了。_

'_Fuck.' Asuka thought. The wheels in her mind turning, debating, carefully considering the benefits and ramifications of this path before the hormones burst in and said 'fuck it, just do it'_  
“操。”明日香心想。她脑海中的轮子转动着，辩论着，仔细权衡这条道路的利弊和后果，直到荷尔蒙爆发，大喊一声“去他妈的，就这么干吧”

"_Let's go." Asuka said in a serious tone, grabbing Shinji's arm and leading him to the edge of the pool._  
“走吧。”明日香严肃地说道，抓住真嗣的手臂，带他走到泳池边。

"_Whaaat?! Asuka?!" Shinji protested as she dragged him out of the water and he hurriedly grabbed a towel to dry as they went to hide his embarrassment._  
“什么？！明日香？！”真嗣抗议道，她把他拖出水面，他急忙抓起一条毛巾边走边擦，试图掩饰自己的尴尬。

_She guided him through the hallways of the facility, avoiding the cameras' line-of-sight and half-drag half-lead Shinji to a place where there were no prying eyes. Or well she really hoped there were no cameras in the locker room.  
她带着他穿过设施的走廊，避开摄像头的视线，半拖半领地将真嗣带到了一个没有窥探目光的地方。或者说，她真心希望更衣室里没有摄像头。_

_Having arrived she shoved him in the empty locker room and he fumbled onto a low bench in the corner of the room.  
到达后，她把他推进空无一人的更衣室，他踉跄地跌坐在房间角落的一张矮凳上。_

"_Asuka I'm sorr-" Shinji went silent midway through his trademarked slogan and gulped as he saw the predacious grin on Asuka's face as she made her way over to him._  
“明日香，我……”真嗣在说出他那标志性的道歉词中途突然噤声，咽了口唾沫，因为他看到明日香脸上那狩猎般的笑容正朝他逼近。

"_I think you need a test Ikari."Asuka said approaching him._  
"我认为你需要一个测试，碇。" 明日香说着向他走近。

"_A test?" Shinji said nervously, trying to keep his legs together to hide the offending member._  
"测试？" 真嗣紧张地说，试图并拢双腿以掩盖那令人尴尬的部分。

"_Yeah, I want to see what you remember." Asuka said finally reaching him and bending over at her hips giving him an envious view of the cleavage in her bikini. "For example thermal expansion." She said giving her bust a slight jiggle._  
"是的，我想看看你还记得多少。" 明日香终于走到他面前，弯腰俯身，让他得以一窥她比基尼下的深沟。"比如说热膨胀。" 她边说边轻轻晃动胸部。

"_Thermal Expansion?" Shinji's mind immediately recalling where he'd heard her say that before and dreading where this was going._  
"热胀冷缩？" 真嗣的脑海立刻回想起她之前提到过的地方，同时对接下来可能发生的事情感到恐惧。

"_Yes. Take my hand. It's warm isn't it?" Asuka said placing her right hand upon his cheek. It_ was _warm he thought before she continued. "What do you think will happen if I put it here?" She said as she grabbed firmly at his groin area. "Do you think it'll expand?" Asuka asked as Shinji's face grew bright red and he winced at her too-rough touch "Or is it already ready?"Asuka whispered into his ear in a seductively teasing tone._  
"是的。握住我的手。是不是很温暖？" 明日香说着，将她的右手放在他的脸颊上。他觉得确实很温暖，然后她继续说道："如果我把它放在这里，你觉得会发生什么？" 她一边说，一边紧紧抓住他的下体。"你觉得它会膨胀吗？" 明日香问道，真嗣的脸变得通红，因为她的触碰过于粗鲁而皱起了眉头。"还是说它已经准备好了？" 明日香在他耳边低语，声音中带着挑逗的诱惑。

"_Asuka… but… we don't…have any…" Shinji started before Asuka released her grip and turned as red as Shinji before responding:_  
"明日香……但是……我们没有任何……" 真嗣开口说道，明日香松开了手，脸红得和真嗣一样，然后回应道：

"_Baka not that!" Asuka exclaimed her face becoming just as red as his. "Just some fooling around is all." She said trying to sound confident but Shinji could hear the uncertainty in her voice._  
"笨蛋，不是那个！" 明日香惊呼，她的脸变得和他的脸一样红。"只是开个玩笑而已。" 她试图听起来自信，但真嗣能听出她声音中的不确定。

'_She's never done this before.' Shinji realized. She was in the same boat as he was. His mind made up, with a little help from the teenage hormones screaming "Go! Go! Go!"_  
'她以前从未这样做过。' 真嗣意识到。她和他的处境一样。在他的青少年荷尔蒙尖叫着"去！去！去！"的帮助下，他下定了决心。

"_If you're sure Asuka." Shinji said. Much more confident and sure than Asuka expected. His face set in a stern expression she had only seen in combat._  
"如果你确定的话，明日香。" 真嗣说。比明日香预料的更加自信和坚定。他的脸上带着她只在战斗中见过的严肃表情。

_She sat down on the bench next to him and they both moved so that the bench was between their legs, with one leg on each side. Shinji and Asuka wrapped their arms around the other in a warm embrace and shared a kiss much more passionate than the one at Mt. Asama and a harbinger of things to come. After the kiss, Asuka reached her hand behind her back and undid the knot holding her bikini top in place. Shinji sat there stunned, holding his breath at the sight before him.  
她在他旁边的长椅上坐下，两人都挪了挪位置，让长椅夹在双腿之间，一边一条腿。真嗣和明日香紧紧相拥，温暖地环绕着对方，分享了一个比在浅间山时更为热烈的吻，预示着即将发生的事情。亲吻过后，明日香伸手到背后，解开了固定比基尼上装的结。真嗣坐在那里，目瞪口呆，屏住了呼吸。_

"_I won't slap you this time. Promise." Asuka said, face still red with nervousness as she rested her hands on the bench behind her and leaned back to give Shinji an ample view of her breasts. They were the same creamy white as the rest of her skin save for the medium sized brown nipples that were already standing upward in anticipation. They were big for someone of her age, at least a B cup._  
“这次我不会打你。我保证。”明日香说道，脸上仍因紧张而泛红，她双手撑在身后的长椅上，向后仰去，让真嗣得以饱览她的胸部。它们与她其余的皮肤一样，都是奶油般的白色，除了中等大小的棕色乳头已经因期待而挺立。对于她这个年纪来说，胸部算是相当丰满，至少有 B 罩杯。

_Shinji merely nodded and began to fondle Asuka's breast, even began to kiss them. As Shinji was occupied with her bust she brought her arms up and tugged at the hem of his swim trunks. She was rewarded with Shinji's cock popping out, released from the prison of clothes.  
真嗣只是点了点头，开始抚弄明日香的乳房，甚至亲吻它们。当真嗣专注于她的胸部时，她抬起双臂，拉扯着他泳裤的裤腰。她得到了回报——真嗣的阴茎从衣物的束缚中弹了出来。_

'_I'm alive, this isn't a dream.' Shinji thought as he felt the smooth, warm skin of Asuka's hand on his rock hard member. Gently stroking it. He brought, almost on hormonal autopilot, one of his hands to the knot holding Asuka's bikini bottom and undid it. The last scrap of clothing falling away, leaving Asuka bare before him. She simply and silently opened her legs and he moved his hand down to her opening, that goal of all male ambition and desire._  
‘我还活着，这不是梦。’ 真嗣想着，感受着明日香手中那光滑温暖的肌肤触感，她正温柔地抚摸着他坚硬的部位。他几乎是本能地用一只手解开了明日香比基尼底裤的结，最后一片遮蔽物随之落下，让明日香赤裸地展现在他面前。她只是静静地张开双腿，而他则将手移向她的私密之处，那是所有男性渴望与野心的终极目标。

"_Don't be so rough." Asuka said as Shinji did what every single man has always done the first time he's ever touched a woman's most private place._  
“别那么粗鲁。” 明日香说道，当真嗣第一次触碰到女性最私密的地方时，每个男人都会这么做。

"_Sorry." Shinji apologized his fingers much more lightly exploring the folds and creases of the skin than made up Asuka's pussy._  
“对不起。” 真嗣道歉道，他的手指更加轻柔地探索着明日香私处皮肤的褶皱与纹理。

"_Baka." Asuka responded as she continued stroking him._  
“笨蛋。”明日香回应着，继续抚摸着他。

_Eventually moans and heavy breathing resounded in the locker room as they continued to rub and stroke each other. Despite some early problems both of them had with regulating their grip and strength, they were nonetheless approaching their respective edges. Until, finally, they came.  
最终，更衣室里回荡着呻吟和沉重的呼吸声，他们继续互相摩擦和抚摸。尽管起初两人在控制握力和力度上有些问题，但他们仍然接近各自的极限。直到最后，他们达到了高潮。_

_It was not by a long shot the first time either had orgasmed. But bringing oneself to orgasm and being brought to orgasm by someone else are entirely different things. They looked into each other's eyes, as bodily fluids dripped onto the bench, and chests heaved in breaths. Words passed between them, both too dazed to remember who started it, but absolutely certain they said it. And meant it.  
这绝不是他们第一次达到高潮。但自我达到高潮和被他人带至高潮是完全不同的体验。他们凝视着彼此的眼睛，体液滴落在长椅上，胸膛因呼吸而起伏。话语在他们之间传递，两人都因恍惚而记不清是谁先开口，但绝对确定他们说了，并且是真心的。_

"_I-"_

"_-love-"_  "-爱-"

"_-you."_ "-你。"

"After that the floodwaters broke. Our hearts opened to each other I told him my secrets,…my past."  
"在那之后，洪水决堤。我们的心向彼此敞开，我向他倾诉了我的秘密，……我的过去。"

"And I told her mine."  
"我告诉了她我的。"

_**Is the relationship merely physical. Are you both simply using each other for comfort to avoid being alone?  
这段关系仅仅是肉体上的吗？你们俩是否只是在利用对方寻求安慰，以避免孤独？**_

"**NO!"** The pilots answered in unison. The train they were in seemed to shake at the resolve present in their voices at the denial of such an accusation.  
"不！" 两位飞行员异口同声地回答。他们所在的列车似乎因他们声音中坚定的否认而震动。

Neither pilot knew it but at this time the Magi detected the circumference of the shadow changed by 0.3 micrometers. The Magi were at a complete loss to explain this anomaly and dutifully registered it as a glitch in the observation telemetries.  
两位驾驶员均未察觉，但此时魔导士们检测到阴影的周长变化了 0.3 微米。魔导士们对此异常现象完全无法解释，只得如实记录为观测遥测数据中的一个故障。

_**Such radiance. Let's see where you first became one.  
如此光辉。让我们看看你最初成为一体的地方。**_

'They don't mean…' '他们不是指…'

'…do they?' “……是吗？”

_It was some days after the battle against the 9__th_ _Angel Matarael. Despite the lack of electricity and power the battle had been fairly simple, a full burst of a pallet rifle all that was necessary. But Asuka's Eva had been damaged by the Angel's acid. Shinji and Asuka had both had to hide their worry and relief after the battle from Rei, lest she discover their feelings for each other._  
在与第 9 使徒马特拉尔的战斗过去几天后，尽管电力和能源供应不足，那场战斗却相当简单，只需一次全力的卡宾枪射击便足够了。但明日香的 EVA 被使徒的酸液所伤。战斗结束后，真嗣和明日香不得不隐藏起彼此的担忧与宽慰，以免被绫波发现他们之间的感情。

_They had both agreed to keep their relationship a secret worried others would try to separate them. They had of course fooled around more since the escapade in the locker room but they had not yet done the deed. Both had been unready to do that, but after the danger of their last battle and not knowing what the future held, they had decided the present was a good a time as any.  
他们一致同意将这段关系保密，担心其他人会试图拆散他们。当然，自更衣室那次冒险以来，他们有过更多的亲密接触，但尚未真正发生关系。两人都还未准备好迈出那一步，但在经历了上一场战斗的危险，且未来充满未知的情况下，他们认为现在正是时候。_

_Their one concern was protection. But Shinji had an idea there. When they went back to school he did his best to encourage, as discreetly as possible, Toji and Kensuke's jibes about him and Asuka being newlyweds until eventually they dared him to go and buy some protection so that in Toji's words "The world won't have any little red-haired devils running around." That way it would look to any observing Section 2 agents that he was merely buying it out of a dare by his friends.  
他们唯一担心的是保护措施。但真嗣对此有个主意。当他们回到学校时，他尽可能谨慎地鼓励东治和健司对他和明日香像新婚夫妇一样的嘲讽，直到最后他们激他去买些保护用品，用东治的话说就是“这样世界上就不会有小红毛鬼到处跑了。”这样一来，对任何观察的第二课特工来说，他只是因为朋友的挑衅才去买这些东西的。_

_Once that was taken care of they waited until one of Misato's double shifts dealing with any myriad of issues that arose from her position as Operations Director.  
一旦这件事解决了，他们就等到美里处理作为作战部长职位上层出不穷问题的双班倒之一。_

_They were in Asuka's room. Blinds shut, doors locked, a towel laid out underneath her. Both of them wearing nothing but the nervous smiles on their faces.  
他们在明日香的房间里。窗帘拉上，门锁紧，她身下铺着一条毛巾。两人身上除了脸上紧张的笑容，什么都没穿。_

_Shinji opened the foil packet and followed the pictograph instructions as he unrolled it onto his hard and eager member, praying to every god he knew that he did it right.  
真嗣打开铝箔包装，按照图解说明将其展开，小心翼翼地套在自己坚挺而急切的部位上，心中默默祈祷着每一位他所知的神明，希望自己能做对。_

_Condom in place, he hoped, he positioned his member at her entrance, the reservoir cap rubbing against her waiting labia. He leaned down and they shared a soft kiss before he placed his hands on her knees and readied himself.  
希望避孕套已经就位，他将自己的部位对准她的入口，储精囊轻触着她等待中的阴唇。他俯下身，两人共享了一个温柔的吻，随后他将双手放在她的膝盖上，准备就绪。_

'_Don't mess this up baka.' Asuka thought as the moment dragged on to infinity before she felt Shinji's cock, slowly tentatively push its way into her vagina before hitting something that blocked his advance. Shinji knew what it was. Asuka knew what it was. It was the last obstacle in their path to becoming one._  
'别搞砸了，笨蛋。' 明日香心想，随着时间的无限延长，她终于感受到真嗣的阴茎缓慢而试探性地推进她的阴道，直到触碰到阻碍他前进的东西。真嗣知道那是什么，明日香也知道。那是他们成为一体前的最后一道障碍。

_Shinji looked down at Asuka's face for reassurance. She nodded in response and brought her hand up to his squeezing it to let him know it was okay, that she wanted this. Encouraged by this Shinji pulled back before thrusting forward and trying to, as gently as he could, take away Asuka's maidenhood.  
真嗣低头看着明日香的脸，寻求安慰。她点头回应，抬起手握紧他的手，让他知道一切都没问题，她愿意这么做。受到鼓舞的真嗣先退后，然后尽可能温柔地向前挺进，试图夺走明日香的童贞。_

_Asuka gritted her teeth and let out a curse at the pain she felt as her hymen break. Blood flowed out in the space between Shinji's cock and the walls of her vagina, dripping onto the towel under them. After feeling the tearing that had happened within Asuka Shinji stopped moving and stared at Asuka, worry etched onto his face as he saw her grimace and the blood that flowed forth.  
明日香咬紧牙关，因处女膜破裂的疼痛而咒骂出声。血从真嗣的阴茎与她阴道壁之间的空隙流出，滴落在他们身下的毛巾上。感受到明日香体内的撕裂，真嗣停止了动作，担忧地盯着她，看到她皱眉和流出的血，脸上写满了忧虑。_

'_Did I do something wrong?' Shinji thought anxiously._  
'我是不是做错了什么？' 真嗣焦虑地想。

"_Go slow." Asuka said almost out of breath as the pain subsided and she began to fully feel the sense of fullness that now permeated her. It just felt right, like they were made for each other. Shinji responded with a nod and soft slow strokes of his member._  
“慢点。”明日香几乎喘不过气来，随着疼痛的消退，她开始完全感受到那种充盈感，仿佛他们是为彼此而生。真嗣点头回应，温柔地缓缓抽动着他的那部分。

_Asuka was so tight it felt as if every part of Shinji's cock was being squeezed when he was in her. Even through the condom he could feel her walls and the resistance they offered as he moved in and out of her. It had barely been a few minutes and Shinji was already unable to hold back the pressure building up in his balls.  
明日香紧致得仿佛真嗣的每一寸都受到了挤压。即便隔着避孕套，他也能感受到她的内壁以及它们提供的阻力，随着他在她体内进出。才不过几分钟，真嗣就已经无法抑制住那股在睾丸中积聚的压力。_

"_Fuck." Asuka said as she felt Shinji's premature orgasm even through the latex. She was just starting to get some tingles of pleasure too._  
“该死。”明日香说道，即便隔着乳胶，她也能感觉到真嗣的过早高潮。她自己也才刚刚开始感受到一些愉悦的刺痛。

_Shinji pulled his now spent member from Asuka's pussy. The condom's reservoir was filled with Shinji's load, the milky substance almost obscuring the details of his cockhead, while the latex was covered in rapidly drying blood, as where Asuka's labia and her thighs around it.  
真嗣从明日香的私处抽出他那已疲惫的阳具。避孕套的储精囊里装满了真嗣的精液，乳白色的液体几乎遮住了他龟头的细节，而乳胶上则覆盖着迅速干涸的血迹，明日香的阴唇和周围的大腿也是如此。_

"_Don't you fucking dare Third." Asuka said, pre-empting Shinji's apology. She leaned up and reached over to the nightstand, grabbed another foil packet and threw it at Shinji, who gracelessly caught it in his hands. Her meaning clear. Try Again._  
“你他妈敢道歉试试，第三。”明日香抢在真嗣道歉前说道。她起身伸手到床头柜，抓起另一个锡箔包装扔向真嗣，他笨拙地用手接住了。她的意图很明确。再来一次。

_It was the next day, and three condoms later, when Shinji finally managed to last long enough to make her come with strokes from his member. To say it was a cathartic experience for the both of them would be both correct and a huge understatement. They laid there panting at the exertions, Shinji on top of Asuka, his member still inside her, still hard despite expending itself, and stared into each other's eyes peering into the other's soul and knowing in that moment that their bond was unbreakable, that they completed the other on every level, mind, body and spirit.  
到了第二天，用了三个避孕套之后，真嗣终于坚持得足够久，用他的阳具抽插让明日香达到了高潮。说这对他们俩都是一种宣泄性的体验，既正确又是一个巨大的轻描淡写。他们躺在那里喘着粗气，真嗣压在明日香身上，他的阳具仍在她体内，尽管已经射精却依然坚挺，他们凝视着对方的眼睛，窥视着彼此的灵魂，在那一刻明白他们的纽带是牢不可破的，他们在心灵、身体和精神上完美地互补。_

"_I love you."_ "我爱你。"

_**We have what we need.  
我们已备齐所需之物。**_

**Meanwhile 与此同时**

Major Katsuragi was not having a good day. Both her charges, her children, were lost and she had been relieved of command by her "friend" Ritsuko for being emotionally compromised. 'They don't even care about the pilots, hell they don't even care about Unit-02, only Unit-01. Why? What is so special about it?' Misato thought as she took another drag of her cigarette in a desperate attempt to calm her nerves.  
葛城美里少校的日子并不好过。她负责的两个孩子，她的孩子们，都失踪了，而她的“朋友”律子以情绪受损为由解除了她的指挥权。'他们甚至不在乎驾驶员，见鬼，他们连二号机都不在乎，只关心初号机。为什么？它有什么特别的？'美里一边想着，一边又吸了一口烟，试图以此平复紧张的情绪。

"I thought you quit." "我以为你辞职了。"

Misato turned around and saw the perpetually unshaven face of Ryoji Kaji, though his standard grin was absent, replaced instead with a melancholic grimace.  
美里转过身，看到了总是胡子拉碴的加持良治的脸，不过他那惯常的笑容不见了，取而代之的是一副忧郁的苦笑。

"Why are you here?" Misato remarked with more bitterness than necessary as her emotions looked for any outlet.  
"你为什么在这里？" 美里带着不必要的苦涩说道，她的情绪急于找到任何发泄口。

"I heard about what happened. I knew how'd you be feeling." Kaji answered. Most would call his tone nonchalant but Misato knew him well enough to know that he was serious.  
"我听说了发生的事。我知道你现在的心情。" 加持回答道。大多数人可能会认为他的语气漫不经心，但美里足够了解他，知道他是认真的。

"Is that so?" Misato said as she stubbed out her cigarette and turned to face her former lover.  
"是吗？" 美里说着，捻灭了香烟，转身面对她曾经的恋人。

"I'm worried about them too, they're good kids." Kaji stated before continuing his face and tone darkening "…they didn't deserve this." Kaji said after a moment of silence had passed between them.  
"我也担心他们，他们都是好孩子。" 加持说道，随后他的表情和语气变得阴沉，"……他们不该遭受这些。" 在两人之间短暂的沉默后，加持补充道。

"Don't talk about them like that! Like they're already dead!" The suffering Major said, crossing the distance between them and starting to punch at Kaji's chest as the dam holding back her emotions finally ruptured and she began crying as the punches rained down. Kaji merely silently took her in a tight embrace pinning her arms to her sides to spare his chest further abuse. Misato's legs seemed to turn to jelly and she collapsed in Kaji's arms and they both sat on the cold concrete beneath them, Misato gripping the collar of his shirt tightly as she wet it with her now uncontrolled tears.  
"别那样说他们！好像他们已经死了一样！" 痛苦的大佐说道，跨过他们之间的距离，开始向加持的胸口挥拳，情绪的堤坝终于崩溃，她开始哭泣，拳头如雨点般落下。加持只是默默地将她紧紧抱住，将她的手臂固定在身体两侧，以免他的胸口再受伤害。美里双腿似乎变得无力，瘫倒在加持的怀里，他们一起坐在冰冷的混凝土上，美里紧紧抓住他的衬衫领口，泪水不受控制地浸湿了它。

'I can't leave her.' Kaji thought. The realization sending a shudder through his body. He knew the path his line of work and his quest for the truth would put him on. What the likely outcome was. 'But then she'll be all alone.' The thought in Kaji's mind was like a spark, igniting a wildfire that spread and consumed everything in its path. His decision made, his resolve strengthening. The truth had to be found, but not at the cost of leaving Misato alone in this world.  
'我不能离开她。' 加持心想。这个认识让他的身体不由自主地颤抖。他知道自己的工作路线和追求真相的道路会把他引向何方。可能的结果是什么。'但那样她就会孤身一人了。' 这个念头在加持的脑海中如同火花，点燃了一场野火，蔓延并吞噬了一切。他做出了决定，决心更加坚定。真相必须被找到，但不能以让美里独自留在这个世界为代价。

"I love you Katsuragi." "我爱你，葛城。"

**In the Shadow. 在阴影中。**

"I don't want to die!" Both pilots screamed in their respective entry plugs as they noticed the LCL they were in had become cloudy. Their hands uselessly battering themselves against the manual release.  
"我不想死！" 两位驾驶员在各自的插入栓中尖叫，他们注意到自己所处的 LCL 变得浑浊。他们的双手徒劳地敲打着手动释放装置。

"I want to see him again!" Asuka said bringing a fist down in her seat.  
"我想再见到他！" 明日香说着，一拳砸在座椅上。

"I want to see her again!" Shinji said as he used his legs to try and force the manual release, again to no avail.  
"我想再见她一面！" 真嗣说着，用双腿试图强行打开手动释放装置，但又一次无功而返。

"Please…" They both said as the oxygen deprived environment in both their entry plugs sent them back to edge of unconsciousness. Just as they both neared that precipice something awoke simultaneously in the cores of both their Eva Units and made themselves known  
"请……" 他们同时说道，随着驾驶舱内缺氧的环境将他们推向昏迷的边缘。就在他们即将坠入那深渊之际，某种力量同时在两台 EVA 的核心中苏醒，并向他们显露了存在。

"Mother?" "母亲？"

"Mama?" “妈妈？”

As the pilots fully slipped into unconsciousness the eyes of the their Evas shone with a bright white light in the endless abyss they were in.  
当驾驶员们完全陷入昏迷时，他们的 Eva 眼中在无尽的深渊中闪烁着耀眼的白光。

And as the Evas activated Kyoko, being the more inquisitive one, saw something, **interesting** in the seemingly infinite Dirac Sea. She reached out and grabbed.  
随着 Eva 的启动，好奇心更强的 Kyoko 在看似无垠的狄拉克海中看到了一些有趣的东西。她伸出手，抓住了。

**NERV Forward Command Post  
NERV 前线指挥所**

"Let's start while there is still a chance the pilots might be alive." Ritsuko said looking at her watch as she advanced the countdown to the start of the operation.  
"趁飞行员们可能还活着，我们开始吧。" 律子说着，看着手表，将行动的倒计时提前了。

"Energy level rising!" Hyuga said as the dials and readings at his station went haywire and gave nonsensical readings that shouldn't be possible with humanity's current understanding of physics. They showed the shadow was threaded with red cracks and seemed on the verge of shattering along with the ground. How does a Dirac Sea, an entire dimension of infinite vacuum, just shatter like tempered glass struck by a rock? What kind of power would that take?  
"能量水平上升！" 日向看着他的仪器上的刻度和读数乱作一团，出现了一些根据人类当前物理学理解不可能的荒谬读数。它们显示阴影布满了红色的裂纹，似乎随时会随着地面一起破碎。一个狄拉克海，一个充满无限真空的整个维度，怎么会像被石头击中的钢化玻璃一样破碎？那需要什么样的力量？

"But we haven't done anything yet!" An exasperated Ritsuko exclaimed.  
"但我们还没做任何事呢！" 律子恼怒地喊道。

"Could it be Shinji and Asuka?!" Ibuki postulated as she tried to make sense of what the data was telling her.  
"难道是真嗣和明日香？！" 伊吹推测道，试图理解数据显示的信息。

"Their power levels should be drained, it's not possible!" Ritsuko said. Her tone one of incredulity as she leaned over Maya and looked at the readings they were getting.  
"他们的能量水平应该已经耗尽，这不可能！" 律子说道。她的语气充满难以置信，俯身在真耶旁边，盯着他们得到的读数。

The zebra-striped orb shook, releasing a strained, painful cry from somewhere as the white of its body slowly turned black leaving nothing but a dark sphere that seemed to be shaking.  
那黑白条纹的球体颤抖着，从某处发出痛苦而紧张的哭喊声，随着身体的白色逐渐变黑，最终只剩下一个似乎在颤抖的黑色球体。

A hand, stained red with blood, erupted through the sphere and gripped at the opening it had made. Soon another hand closed tight around something burst through the opening as well and with its forearm on the other side joined its counterpart to rip an ever larger hole in the screaming orb. Eventually, the small opening gave way to an immense tear in the orb through which appeared the source of the Angel's demise.  
一只沾满鲜血的手从球体中猛然穿出，紧抓着它所制造的裂口。很快，另一只手也紧紧握住某物，从裂口中冲出，前臂在另一侧与同伴汇合，共同撕扯着那尖叫的球体，使其裂口越来越大。最终，那个小裂口演变成球体上的巨大裂缝，从中显现出导致天使灭亡的源头。

Both Evas appeared, bloody and still holding onto each other's hands as they seemingly stood in the fissure they had made in the angel, howling in triumph as they reemerged into the world. The sphere finally gave way and collapsed onto the ground leaving both Evas standing on a craggy, scarred surface, covered in blood. The Evas stopped their berserk roars for a moment and looked at each other. Unit 02 lifting its hand up toward Unit 01 and offering what it had in it.  
两台 EVA 现身了，血迹斑斑，依旧紧握着彼此的手，仿佛站在天使体内裂缝中，胜利地咆哮着重新回到这个世界。球体终于支撑不住，崩塌在地，留下两台 EVA 站立在崎岖、伤痕累累的地面上，浑身是血。EVA 们暂时停止了狂暴的吼叫，相互对视。2 号机举起手伸向 1 号机，手中握着某物。

"No it can't be…" Ritsuko said in horror as she saw the two double helical shapes Unit 02 had clenched in its hand.  
“不，这不可能……”律子惊恐地说道，她看到 2 号机手中紧握的两个双螺旋形状。

"How are there two S2 organs? Aren't all the angels all supposed to have just one?!" Lt. Ibuki said in astonished horror at the sight.  
"怎么会有两个 S2 器官？不是所有的使徒都只有一个吗？！" 伊吹中尉惊恐地看着这一幕说道。

"Perhaps since this Angel has two forms, it has two S2 organs, one for its shadow-orb body the other for the Dirac Sea?" Aoba offered as a possible explanation, eyes still glued to the scene before him as the red unit gave one of the S2 organs to its blood-stained purple counterpart.  
"也许因为这个使徒有两种形态，所以它有两个 S2 器官，一个用于它的阴影球体，另一个用于狄拉克海？" 青叶提出了一种可能的解释，眼睛仍然紧盯着眼前的场景，红色机体将其中一个 S2 器官交给了沾满血迹的紫色机体。

"Or maybe since the Angel exists in multiple dimensions so does its S2 organ therefore it could have been duplicated due to quantum uncertainty?" Hyuga suggested, also captivated by the sight of both Eva's biting into and subsuming the S2 organs into themselves.  
"或者因为使徒存在于多个维度，所以它的 S2 器官也因此存在多个，可能是由于量子不确定性导致的复制？" 日向也着迷地看着两台 EVA 吞噬并吸收 S2 器官的情景。

"Damn! There's still so much we don't know about the angels!" Ritsuko cursed as she gazed at the berserker Eva's. Both units now let out triumphal roars atop the shattered shadow they had emerged out of, their restraining bolts and shoulder armor bulging and shattering off, revealing the cloned flesh beneath. Afterwards the maws of both units turned in unison to the sky before slowly panning down toward the NERV forward command post, and to Ritsuko it looked as if they were glaring directly into her soul. Filling it with the cold, absolute terror of realization.  
"该死！我们对使徒的了解还是太少了！" 律子咒骂着，目光紧锁在狂暴化的 EVA 身上。两台机体此刻正站在破碎的阴影之上，发出胜利的咆哮，它们的拘束器和肩甲纷纷膨胀并破碎，露出下面克隆的肉体。随后，两台机体的巨口齐齐转向天空，再缓缓下移，对准了 NERV 前线指挥所。在律子看来，它们仿佛正直视着她的灵魂，将那冰冷、绝对的恐惧深深植入她的内心。

"Call off the airstrike, we can't risk provoking them into a berserker state against us!" Ritsuko screamed as the fear nearly overtook her professionalism.  
"取消空袭，我们不能冒险激怒它们，让它们对我们发起狂暴攻击！" 律子尖叫道，恐惧几乎压倒了她的专业素养。

"Wyvern this is Kingdom. Abort, abort, abort!" Aoba screamed into the headset in a desperate attempt to avoid that exceedingly horrible possibility.  
"飞龙，这里是王国。终止任务，终止，终止，终止！" 青叶对着耳机嘶吼，拼命试图避免那个极其可怕的可能性。

Above the combined might of every air force this side of the planet, with enough firepower to glass a continent, veered away and returned to their bases.  
在这颗星球这一侧所有空军联合的强大火力之上，足以将整个大陆化为玻璃的毁灭力量，转向离去，返回了各自的基地。

The Evas watched them as they went, before deactivating as their berserker states receded and they shutdown, collapsing onto the shattered remains of the Angel they had so thoroughly destroyed.  
EVA 们目送它们离去，随后随着狂暴状态的消退而停机，倒在了它们彻底摧毁的天使残骸上。

**A/N:** So here is chapter 3. It's a long one, I thought about making it 2 parts but decided against it. There was a lot of stuff I wanted to unpack and world building to do. Specifically, one thing I see with a lot of Lemons is that Shinji and Asuka for some reason open up and then next minute are going at it like rabbits, so I wanted to give an overview of how they got here and how the relationship built up. Also my favorite part of Evangelion is the emotional/psychological side so I wanted that in. The next ones are definitely going to be shorter. The S2 organs are my way of making Shinji and Asuka's Evas ridiculously OP so that they can easily deal with the stuff coming at them in the future. Because these two episodes in the series are the inflection point after which the positive upwards track the characters were on, comes crashing down in burning fire and sinks to the bottom of the ocean. That doesn't really fit with the tone of this fic, or all of the steamy lemons, and hell I've seen even more ridiculous stuff on this site to give the characters a happy ending. As always review and let me know.  
作者注：这里是第三章。篇幅较长，我曾考虑将其分为两部分，但最终决定不这么做。有许多内容需要展开，还有世界观的构建工作。特别是，我发现很多同人文中，真嗣和明日香不知为何突然敞开心扉，下一刻就如同兔子般激烈互动，我想概述他们是如何走到这一步以及关系如何建立的。此外，我最喜欢《EVA》的部分是情感/心理层面，因此我希望保留这一点。接下来的章节肯定会更短。S2 器官是我让真嗣和明日香的 EVA 变得极其强大的手段，以便他们能轻松应对未来迎面而来的挑战。因为在原作中，这两集是转折点，之后角色们原本积极向上的轨迹会轰然崩塌，陷入火海并沉入海底。这与本篇同人文的基调不符，也不适合那些火辣的情节，而且我在这网站上见过更离谱的内容，足以给角色们一个幸福的结局。一如既往，欢迎评论并告诉我你的想法。

### Chapter 4  Special I: Happy Valentine's Day

For the uninitiated this story is a Lemon. Which means gratuitous amounts of content that is adult in nature. So if that's not your cup of tea leave now.  
对于不熟悉的人来说，这是一篇柠檬文。这意味着包含大量成人内容。所以如果这不是你的菜，请现在离开。

This story is in the same universe as the "Shower Guest" though it does not follow chronologically from the previous chapter. This is merely a one-shot special I made for Valentine's Day and put in the same story for the sake of convenience.  
这个故事与《淋浴访客》处于同一宇宙，尽管它并不按时间顺序紧随前一章节。这只是我为情人节制作的一个特别短篇，为了方便起见放在同一个故事里。

---
Asuka Langley Sohryu, Second Child and pilot of NERV's Evangelion Unit-02, let out a tired sigh as she made her way from the elevator toward the apartment she shared with a penguin, a drunk, and a baka. She was exhausted from her shopping trip with Hikari, the shops hadn't had much good stuff so she only carried two small bags in her hands filled with a few tops and a new pair of shoes. It was still the early afternoon so the eternal summer sun of Tokyo-3 was beating down with the hottest part of the day in full swing.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷，NERV 的二号机驾驶员，第二适格者，在从电梯走向与一只企鹅、一个酒鬼和一个笨蛋共住的公寓时，疲惫地叹了口气。与光逛街让她筋疲力尽，商店里也没什么好东西，她手里只拎着两个小袋子，装着几件上衣和一双新鞋。正值午后时分，东京三区的永恒夏日阳光正炙烤着大地，最热的时候已然到来。

'Wonder if the baka is home yet.' Asuka said as she took out her key to open the door to the apartment. As the door hissed open Asuka noticed something out of place as she stepped over the threshold. Something, a lot of somethings actually, were scattered on the floor in the hallway. Now it being the Katsuragi household, the floor being a mess was not unusual as the military discipline of the owner didn't seem to apply anywhere else besides NERV. But something was off about this mess. Asuka set her bags down and bent over to inspect one of them. She felt the soft texture as she picked it up and as it came closer to her nose she recognized the scent and knew immediately what it was, what they all were.  
‘不知道那笨蛋回来了没有。’ 明日香说着，掏出钥匙打开公寓的门。门一开，明日香就注意到有些不对劲，她跨过门槛时发现走廊地板上散落着一些东西。在葛城家，地板凌乱并不稀奇，因为主人的军事纪律似乎只适用于 NERV，而不包括其他地方。但这次的凌乱有些异样。明日香放下包，弯腰检查其中一件物品。她感受到柔软的质地，当它靠近鼻子时，她闻到了熟悉的气味，立刻认出了这是什么，以及它们都是什么。

'What if it was Misato that came home first baka?' Asuka thought bewildered as even though she called him a baka he still generally did think ahead most of the time. In response to her unspoken question the answering machine spurred into action and played a message of Misato's recorded voice:  
‘万一回来的是美里呢，笨蛋？’ 明日香困惑地想，尽管她称他为笨蛋，但他通常还是能提前考虑很多事情。对于她未说出口的问题，答录机突然启动，播放了美里的录音信息：

"Hi Shinji and Asuka, I've got some meetings so I won't be home until late in the evening. I'll grab takeout on the way home so don't make anything for me. Bye."  
“嗨，真嗣和明日香，我有些会议要开，所以晚上才会回家。我会带外卖回来，不用给我准备晚饭。再见。”

'Well that answers that question.' Asuka thought as she unzipped her knee length black leather boots she had worn to the mall with Hikari and placed them with the other shoes, leaving her in her tight dark blue jeans and a sleeveless red blouse with a single button at the back of her neck as she followed the trail of rose petals already knowing where they led.  
“这下问题解决了。”明日香想着，脱下了与光去商场时穿的那双黑色长筒皮靴，与其他鞋子放在一起，只留下紧身的深蓝色牛仔裤和一件背后仅有一颗扣子的无袖红色衬衫。她顺着玫瑰花瓣的痕迹走去，早已知道它们通向何方。

'Shinji surely must have been testing the boundaries of how little of a shit Section 2 gives about the pilots and what they do when getting all of this.' Asuka thought as she followed the path to the door to her room and opened it. Looking around she saw there were rose petals scattered all over her bed and at least half a dozen lit candles lighting the room. She closed her eyes and breathed in the scent.

"Lavender." Asuka said aloud.  
“薰衣草。”明日香大声说道。

"Happy Valentine's Day Asuka." Shinji Ikari said from behind her.  
“情人节快乐，明日香。” 碇真嗣在她身后说道。

"Baka, it's not even February." Asuka chided without turning around.  
“笨蛋，现在连二月都还没到呢。” 明日香没有转身，只是责备道。

"Yeah, but we missed the last one and…" The rest of Shinji's words were unsaid but Asuka understood the meaning. In their line of work the future was always uncertain, the danger ever-present. Not to mention the fact that the secrecy of their relationship necessitated it be conducted only when they were alone. And those moments were always few and far between so best to make the most of them.  
“是啊，但我们错过了上一个，而且……” 真嗣的话没有说完，但明日香明白他的意思。在他们这个行业，未来总是充满不确定性，危险无处不在。更不用说他们关系的秘密性要求只能在独处时进行，而这些时刻总是少之又少，所以最好充分利用它们。

"I get it baka." Asuka said as she pivoted around to look at Shinji. He was dressed only in some white shorts that looked to be a mix of cotton and spandex and held something in his hands that she couldn't quite see. "I thought you were going to the arcade today with those stooges?"  
"我明白了，笨蛋。" 明日香转过身来看着真嗣。他只穿着一条混合了棉和氨纶的白短裤，手里拿着什么东西，她看不太清楚。"我以为你今天会和那帮家伙去游戏厅呢？"

"I was but then Misato called, and I decided to make a little surprise for you instead." Shinji answered sheepishly and avoided eye contact.  
"本来是的，但后来美里打电话来，我决定给你准备一个小惊喜。" 真嗣腼腆地回答，眼神躲闪。

"It's not nice to lie to your girlfriend, Third." Asuka mock scolded him as she brought both her hands up to his cheeks and cradled his head in her hands as she kissed him deeply and affectionately. Shinji brought his own hands up around her waist, caressing her softly.  
"对女朋友撒谎可不好，三号。" 明日香假装责备他，双手捧起他的脸颊，深情地吻了他。真嗣也双手环抱她的腰，温柔地抚摸着她。

"Girlfriend? Is that what we are?" Shinji asked somewhat surprised after the kiss ended. They had been together for a while now but she had never used that word before to describe their relationship.  
"女朋友？我们是这样称呼的吗？" 亲吻结束后，真嗣有些惊讶地问道。他们在一起已经有一段时间了，但她从未用过这个词来形容他们的关系。

"Do you have a better word?" Asuka asked her hands still draped around his neck as he slowly steered her in the direction of the rose covered bed.  
"你有更好的词吗？" 明日香问道，双手依然搭在他的脖子上，而他缓缓地引导她向那张玫瑰覆盖的床走去。

"Girlfriend sounds too public." Shinji said as Asuka's calves reached the bedframe. "Lover maybe?" Shinji said as he gently guided her down onto the bed so that they were both lying horizontally.  
"女朋友听起来太公开了。" 真嗣说，当明日香的小腿触到床架时。"或许用恋人？" 真嗣说着，温柔地将她引到床上，两人横躺下来。

"Massage oil?" Asuka asked as she finally got a good look at what was in Shinji's hand and put the final piece in the puzzle for what he had planned.  
"按摩油？" 明日香终于看清了真嗣手里的东西，这让她完全明白了他的计划。

"Coconut." Shinji said holding up the bottle so she could get a good look at it in the candlelight.  
"是椰子味的。" 真嗣举起瓶子，让她在烛光下看得更清楚。

"Unbutton me, then." Asuka said as she leaned up and move her flowing red hair away from her neck. Shinji undid the single button and Asuka lifted it up over her head leaving her in just her  
"帮我解开扣子。" 明日香说着，微微前倾，将她那飘逸的红发从脖颈处拨开。真嗣解开了一个扣子，明日香便将上衣从头顶脱下，只留下她的

bra and jeans. She stood up and after undoing the button and zipper of her jeans took them, and her panties, off in one swift motion letting them crumple on the floor along with her discarded socks. She then straddled Shinji, still sitting on the bed. He had a good view of her surprisingly plain white bra with a pink bow between the two cups. He reached behind her back and undid the clasp letting her last article of clothing fall into his lap.  
胸罩和牛仔裤。她站起身，解开牛仔裤的纽扣和拉链，迅速将裤子和内裤一并脱下，任其与丢弃的袜子一同皱缩在地板上。随后，她跨坐在仍坐在床上的真嗣身上。他得以一览她那件出乎意料朴素的白色胸罩，两个罩杯间还系着一只粉色的蝴蝶结。他伸手到她背后，解开搭扣，让她最后一件衣物落入他的膝头。

Shinji was always amazed at how even now, after they had had sex countless times, Asuka's body laid before him still managed to make his breath catch in his throat like the first time he saw it in the locker room all that time ago. He run his hands up and down Asuka's back before gliding them down to her ass and grabbing it in both hands as he brought his face to her breasts and began kissing them. Starting with the creamy flesh of her mounds as his fingers made circles around her areolas. Asuka let out a moan as those circles became light pinches followed by Shinji sucking on her right nipple. His tongue flicking the aroused nipple back and forth in his mouth sending a tingly sensation through her body. She also felt another shiver go through her, though this wasn't from her bust but rather her thigh, the sensation prompting her to speak up:  
即使经历了无数次的亲密接触，每当看到眼前阿斯卡的身躯，真嗣仍会像初次在更衣室中见到时那样，心跳加速、呼吸一窒。他双手在阿斯卡的背上上下游走，随后滑向她的臀部，双手紧握，同时将脸贴近她的胸前，开始亲吻。从她丰满的乳肉开始，手指在她乳晕周围画着圈。随着这些圈圈逐渐变成轻捏，真嗣含住了她的右乳头，舌头在其上来回挑逗，带来一阵阵酥麻感传遍她的全身。阿斯卡不禁发出呻吟，同时感到另一股颤栗穿过身体，这次并非来自胸部，而是大腿，这感觉让她忍不住开口：

"Don't get to excited baka." Asuka said as she felt tingles spread through her body from the attention Shinji was giving her nipples. "Massage first right?" Asuka said as she gently pulled Shinji's face away from her chest and looked into those cobalt spheres of his. She brought her lips down to his in another tender kiss. She opened her lips and pushed her tongue into his mouth meeting his, each sliding over and past the other, more exploring the feel of the other than battling for dominance.  
“别太激动，笨蛋。”明日香说道，她感觉到从真嗣关注她的乳头而引发的阵阵酥麻传遍全身。“先按摩，对吧？”明日香轻柔地将真嗣的脸从胸前拉开，凝视着他那深蓝色的眼眸。她俯下唇，再次温柔地吻上他。她张开双唇，将舌头探入他的口中，与他的舌头相遇，彼此滑过、交缠，更多的是探索对方的触感，而非争夺主导权。

The kiss ended and Asuka laid down on her stomach among the rose petals strewn across her bed. Shinji had removed her blankets and bedspread and in their place put a bare white sheet that he was positive no one would miss.  
吻毕，明日香趴在床上，玫瑰花瓣散落其间。真嗣移走了她的毯子和床单，取而代之的是一张他确信无人会惦记的纯白床单。

'Guess he's planned this through.' The German redhead thought as she noticed what had been done to her bed in the ambience of the candlelight. She closed her eyes and breathed in the scents of the room. The lavender candles, the faint whiff of scent still coming off the nearby rose petals, the smell of coconut as Shinji opened the bottle of massage oil. It all paled in comparison to his scent. That musk of his was something she had never noticed before they were together. It produced such a visceral feeling in Asuka's mind when she consciously recognized it. 'He's here. I'm safe. The nightmares can't get to me as long as I feel his warmth and smell his scent.'  
“看来他是精心策划了这一切。”德国红发少女心想，她在烛光摇曳的氛围中注意到了自己床上的变化。她闭上眼睛，深吸着房间里的香气。薰衣草蜡烛的香味，附近玫瑰花瓣上残留的淡淡香气，还有真嗣打开按摩油瓶时飘出的椰子味。这一切都比不上他的气息。那种麝香般的味道，在他们在一起之前她从未注意到。当明日香有意识地察觉到它时，这种气息在她心中激起了强烈的感受。“他在这里。我很安全。只要我能感受到他的温暖和闻到他的气息，噩梦就无法靠近我。”

Now Shinji was not an expert at giving massages. He didn't know proper techniques and his scrawny arms lacked the strength to really work the muscles in her body in the way a professional masseur could. But what he did know was Asuka's body and its erogenous zones. So he knelt down to the right of Asuka's prone form, to her sides as she faced her head in the opposite direction, eyes closed. Her hair sans neural adapters, flowing radially from her head all over the bed and her body. He gently moved her hair from her back, savoring the soft feeling of her locks in his hand.  
现在，真嗣并不是按摩的专家。他不懂正确的技巧，他那瘦弱的手臂也没有足够的力量像专业按摩师那样深入地按摩她的肌肉。但他所知道的是明日香的身体的敏感带。于是他跪在明日香俯卧的身体右侧，她的头朝相反方向，双眼紧闭。她的头发没有神经接头，从头部向四周散开，覆盖了整个床铺和她自己的身体。他轻轻地将她的头发从背上移开，享受着手中发丝的柔软触感。

The oil was a little chill as it impacted her skin but Shinji's warm hands soon corrected this as he spread it around her back. He worked particularly at the knots of stress that had developed in her lower back around the area just above the curve of her ass, and in her shoulders.

Shinji then moved from her back to her toned yet supple arms rubbing the massage oil into her skin from her shoulder to each of her hands in turn. After that he turned his attention to her hands. Shinji worked both his thumbs into the back of her hands to work the muscles and relax them, afterwards splaying her fingers and massaging each of them individually.  
随后，真嗣从她的背部移至她那紧致而柔软的双臂，将按摩油从她的肩膀涂抹到每一只手。之后，他将注意力转向她的双手。真嗣用双拇指深入她手背，放松肌肉，随后展开她的手指，逐一按摩。

Asuka was in paradise as the tension in her body melted away as Shinji moved his ministrations from her arms to her legs. He used his knuckles on the knots in her left ass cheek that had developed from sitting in entry plugs for too long. His pinky teasing the folds of her most private place as his hands worked on her thigh muscles before moving to the rest of her athletic legs. Now all that remained was her feet. He bent her left foot up at her knee first and used his thumbs to make circles around her metatarsals and relieve the stress in the muscles there. Like with her fingers he massaged each of her toes in turn, cracking them and loosening the muscles.  
随着真嗣从她的手臂转移到双腿，明日香仿佛置身天堂，身体的紧张感逐渐消散。他用指关节按摩她左臀因长时间坐在插入栓中而形成的结节，小指轻触她最私密处的皱褶，双手在她大腿肌肉上工作，随后移至她健美的双腿其他部位。现在只剩下她的双脚。他先将她的左脚弯曲至膝盖，用拇指在她的跖骨周围画圈，缓解那里的肌肉压力。与她的手指一样，他逐一按摩每个脚趾，轻压并放松肌肉。

Once Shinji finished with her other foot Asuka's entire backside was covered in a sheen of oil that glistened in the low light of the candles.  
当真嗣完成她另一只脚的按摩后，明日香整个背部都覆盖了一层油光，在烛光的低照下闪闪发光。

"Time to flip over." Shinji whispered into her ear. Asuka responded by pushing herself up on her elbows and turning over. Her breasts bounced and jiggled at the movement and took a moment to calm down as she lied on her back. Asuka saw Shinji's eyes transfixed on her bust and his fingers open and clench around the bottle of massage oil in his hand.  
"是时候翻个身了。" 真嗣在她耳边低语。明日香回应着撑起手肘，翻过身来。随着动作，她的胸部弹跳着，摇晃了一会儿才在她仰躺时平息下来。明日香看到真嗣的目光紧盯着她的胸脯，他的手指围绕着按摩油瓶张开又握紧。

'He's not goi-' Asuka thoughts were interrupted by Shinji doing exactly what she thought he would. He squeezed the massage oil bottle directly over her breasts, coating them in streams of oil that flowed down her fleshy mounds and all over her chest.  
'他不会——' 明日香的想法被真嗣打断了，他正是她所料想的那样。他直接将按摩油瓶挤在她的胸部上，油流如注，覆盖了她的肉丘，流淌至整个胸前。

'Still a pervert at heart, eh baka?' Asuka mused as Shinji set the bottle aside and kneaded her breasts with both hands. Once her chest had been sufficiently massaged, according to Shinji's own definition of course, he brought his hands down to her stomach. Lightly rubbing at her belly before moving to the front of her legs massaging out the last stress that existed there.  
'内心还是个变态呢，笨蛋？' 明日香暗自想着，真嗣放下瓶子，双手揉捏着她的乳房。根据真嗣自己的标准，她的胸部得到了充分的按摩后，他将手移到她的腹部。轻轻揉搓着她的肚子，然后移至大腿前侧，按摩着那里残留的最后一丝紧张。

Asuka was in a state of heady bliss. Her muscles had never felt so relaxed, so free. Still she knew what was coming next, and how it would make even this feeling pale by comparison.  
明日香正处于一种陶醉的幸福之中。她的肌肉从未如此放松，如此自由。尽管她知道接下来会发生什么，以及它将如何使这种感觉相形见绌。

Shinji took his right hand and placed in on her most private place massaging her hairless labia, getting them to part as Asuka became more excited. He leaned down to her kiss and she moved her head up to meet his. They began passionately kissing each other, the sound of their lips smacking together blending with the crackle of the candles. At the same time Shinji stopped massaging her outer lips and stuck his middle finger into her pussy.  
真嗣用右手放在她最私密的地方，按摩着她无毛的阴唇，使它们分开，随着明日香越来越兴奋。他俯身去吻她，她抬起头来迎接他的吻。他们开始热情地亲吻对方，嘴唇相碰的声音与蜡烛的噼啪声交织在一起。与此同时，真嗣停止了对外阴唇的按摩，将中指插入她的阴道。

Slowly at first, she was still fairly tight but the massage oil greatly helped in that regard. Soon his entire finger was hilted to the knuckle and he began slowly stroking with it. Asuka's back began to arch at the feeling inside her, the heat building. Soon enough Shinji also stuck his index finger inside of her the fingers moving back and forth exciting the rapidly wetting walls of her pussy.  
起初很慢，她仍然相当紧，但按摩油在这方面帮了大忙。很快，他的整根手指都插到了指节处，并开始缓慢地抽动。明日香的后背因体内的感觉而开始弓起，热度逐渐上升。不久，真嗣也将食指插入她的体内，手指来回移动，刺激着她迅速湿润的阴道壁。

Through as of this they never stopped kissing each other. Moving on from using just their lips, now their tongues joined the fray, which seemed to mimic the actions of Shinji's fingers at her lower lips, moving hard and fast in their mouths as they sought to overpower the other. His musicians fingers began curling inside of her, exciting the sensitive folds inside her vagina, sending shivers up her back. She moaned into the kiss they were sharing. What had started out as a small fire in her loins was rapidly becoming an all-consuming inferno.  
从那时起，他们就从未停止过亲吻对方。从仅用双唇的接触，到如今他们的舌头也加入了这场争斗，仿佛在模仿真嗣手指在她下唇的动作，他们在口中激烈而快速地移动，试图压倒对方。他那双音乐家的手指开始在她体内弯曲，刺激着她阴道内敏感的褶皱，让她背脊发麻。她在他唇间发出呻吟。原本只是她下体的一小簇火焰，正迅速变成一场吞噬一切的烈焰。

Especially now since instead of curling inside her Shinji's fingers were now swirling, seemingly touching every crevice and curve inside of her, making it feel as if she was ablaze, her moans became more uncontrollable as she approached her building peak.  
特别是现在，因为真嗣的手指不再只是弯曲，而是在她体内旋转，似乎触碰到了每一个角落和曲线，让她感觉自己仿佛在燃烧，随着她接近高潮，她的呻吟变得更加无法控制。

'Just a little more.' Asuka thought as she felt herself close to the crest of her orgasm. Then she felt Shinji's thumb begin to press gently onto her clit. The electricity it sent through her body was too much for her building peak. A croaking moan escaped her lips as she broke the kiss as her orgasm came crashing down upon her, causing her entire body to shake in Shinji's arms.  
'再一点点。' 明日香想着，当她感觉到自己即将达到高潮的顶峰时。然后她感觉到真嗣的拇指开始轻轻按压她的阴蒂。那股电流穿过她的身体，对她即将到来的高潮来说太过强烈。她发出一声嘶哑的呻吟，打破了亲吻，当她的高潮如潮水般涌来时，她的整个身体在真嗣的怀抱中颤抖。

The sight caused Shinji's already erect member to begin oozing pre-cum from the tip, making a slight splotch on the white cotton-spandex shorts he was wearing.  
这一幕让真嗣本已勃起的下体开始从顶端渗出前液，在白色棉质弹力短裤上留下了一小块湿迹。

The heaving of Asuka's chest slowly calmed down and she began to return to her senses. She hadn't noticed it at the time but when she had come she grabbed at Shinji's left hand and squeezed. Shinji's left hand was still in hers as he extricated his fingers from her. They were wrinkled and covered in her wetness. She brought herself up so she was also sitting on the bed and looking into Shinji's face. His eyes were glazed over the lust evident on his face.  
明日香胸部的起伏逐渐平缓，她开始恢复理智。当时她并未注意到，但在高潮时她抓住了真嗣的左手并紧紧握住。真嗣的左手仍被她握着，当他从她手中抽出手指时，手指已经皱巴巴的，沾满了她的湿润。她让自己坐起来，与真嗣面对面。他的眼神迷离，脸上的欲望显而易见。

She looked down and saw the bulge in his shorts, her mind and her teenage hormones already deciding how they wanted to reward Shinji for the surprise massage. Asuka took her left hand and gently pushed Shinji's chest until he was lying down on the bed. A mischievous grin was on her face as she reached for the hem of his shorts. Shinji lifted up his backside to help in her endeavor and the cotton-spandex shorts came off, freeing Shinji's member which eagerly bounced up and down once it was free from its confinement.  
她低头看到他短裤下的隆起，她的心智和青春期的荷尔蒙已经决定如何奖励真嗣这次意外的按摩。明日香用左手轻轻推了推真嗣的胸口，直到他躺在床上。她脸上露出了调皮的笑容，伸手去拉他短裤的裤腰。真嗣抬起臀部帮助她，棉质弹力短裤被脱下，真嗣的下体迫不及待地弹跳起来，摆脱了束缚。

Asuka moved her body to be between Shinji's legs and took his shaft in her right hand while her left lightly fondled at his balls and the sensitive skin of his inner thighs. She looked down at the tip and the pre-cum that had coated his cockhead. She opened her mouth and at first tentatively licked at the hole it oozed from. She tasted the uniquely salty flavor it had before taking her tongue and swirling it around the head before taking it fully in her mouth.  
明日香挪动身体，让自己位于真嗣的双腿之间，右手握住他的阴茎，左手则轻轻抚弄着他的睾丸和内侧大腿的敏感皮肤。她低头看着龟头和上面沾满的前液。她张开嘴，起初小心翼翼地舔舐着液体渗出的孔洞。她尝到了那独特的咸味，然后用舌头绕着龟头打转，最后将整个阴茎含入口中。

As she did so her eyes looked up at Shinji and her cerulean orbs meet his cobalt spheres as her head bobbed up and down on his shaft. Deeper and deeper she went as her tongue swiftly darted back and forth at the underside of his shaft and her hands never let up.  
与此同时，她的眼睛向上看着真嗣，她那蔚蓝的眸子与他的深蓝眼眸相遇，随着她头部上下起伏，她的舌头迅速在阴茎下方来回游走，双手也从未停歇。

Shinji could feel gobs of spit as they rolled down his shaft and onto his rapidly tightening balls and the skin above his cock. Her lips were getting closer and closer to the base of his shaft and he could hear her beginning to gag at the mass in her mouth. But Sohryu is nothing if not determined.  
真嗣能感觉到唾液沿着阴茎流下，滴落到他紧绷的睾丸和阴茎上方的皮肤上。她的嘴唇越来越接近阴茎的根部，他能听到她因口中的异物开始呛咳。但惣流绝不是轻易放弃的人。

However, Shinji was nearing the end of his ability to hold back his own orgasm. The feeling of his cock in her mouth as she sucked on it was mesmerizing as it was. But to see her doing it with a body covered in a sheen of oil in the candlelight on a bed of roses? That was too much for him.  
然而，真嗣已经接近极限，无法再抑制自己的高潮。她的嘴含着他的阴茎吮吸的感觉本身就令人着迷。但看到她在烛光下，全身涂满油光，躺在玫瑰花床上这样做？这对他来说太过分了。

"Asuka…I'm…" Shinji didn't manage to get out the words before his balls stopped listening to his conscious commands for restraint and loosed themselves up his shaft and into Asuka's mouth. Thankfully Asuka had heard him and had readied herself for it. One, two, three, four spurts from Shinji's cock impacted the roof of her mouth before flowing down the insides of her cheeks onto her tongue or back down onto his cockhead. Once the cum had stopped Asuka sucked at the tip of Shinji's cock to get the cum off of it and after a few moments of playing with the sticky viscous gobs in her mouth swallowed them down.  
“明日香……我……”真嗣还没来得及说完，他的睾丸就不再听从他意识中的克制命令，释放了自己，沿着他的阴茎冲入明日香的口中。幸运的是，明日香听到了他的话，并做好了准备。真嗣的阴茎连续四次喷射，击中了她口腔的顶部，然后流到她的脸颊内侧，落在她的舌头上或再次流回他的阴茎头上。当精液停止后，明日香吮吸着真嗣阴茎的尖端，将精液清除，过了一会儿，她玩弄着口中粘稠的液体，然后吞了下去。

Why did she find this easier than the alternatives? Out of sight out of mind I guess? She wasn't entirely sure thinking about it.  
为什么她觉得这比其他选择更容易？大概是眼不见心不烦吧？她不太确定，想着这个问题。

Still, after swallowing she sat up and looked down at Shinji, he was still coming down from his own high, his chest rising and falling at relatively quick intervals in response. Asuka leaned back and as she did so her hand struck something she turned her head around and another plan began forming in her mind.  
尽管如此，咽下之后她还是坐了起来，低头看着真嗣，他还在从自己的高潮中缓过来，胸膛以相对较快的间隔起伏着。明日香向后靠去，就在这时她的手碰到了什么东西，她转过头，一个新的计划开始在脑海中形成。

"I want you to have some too." Asuka said as she took the massage oil bottle and poured some directly onto Shinji's chest. She was even less experienced than Shinji at giving massages so she just sort of rubbed the oil onto his chest putting some pressure on his pectorals and shoulders to help him relax. Then she got a truly wicked idea.  
“我也想让你试试。”明日香说着拿起按摩油瓶，直接倒了一些在真嗣的胸口。她在按摩方面比真嗣还要缺乏经验，所以她只是简单地揉搓着油在他的胸膛上，对他的胸肌和肩膀施加一些压力，帮助他放松。然后，她有了一个真正邪恶的想法。

She turned the bottle upside down over her chest and poured an obscenely absurd amount of oil on it. Then she took her oil-drenched breasts and rubbed them up and down on Shinji's thighs and legs, lingering over his crotch for far longer than was necessary. Her soft breasts and hard nipples exciting his flesh in ways he had never thought were possible before. Once his legs were coated she dragged her breasts up his chest until their foreheads were touching. They shared a long kiss as Shinji put his arms around her in a tight embrace.  
她将瓶子倒置，在自己的胸前倒下了一大堆油，多得离谱。接着，她用浸满油的胸部在真嗣的大腿和腿上来回摩擦，在他胯部停留的时间远远超过了必要。她柔软的乳房和坚硬的乳头以他从未想过的方式刺激着他的肌肤。当他的双腿都被油覆盖后，她将胸部向上拖到他的胸口，直到他们的额头相触。他们共享了一个长长的吻，真嗣紧紧地抱住了她。

"That was so sexy Asuka." Shinji whispered to her as the kiss ended, though she still lay on top of him. It hadn't been the feeling of her soft, oily mounds, or the sight of what she did with them that had really turned Shinji on. It had been the fact that during the entire process she had never broken eye contact with him.  
“那真是太性感了，明日香。” 真嗣在她耳边低语，尽管她仍压在他身上。并非她柔软、油滑的胸部触感，或是她对它们所做的动作真正让真嗣兴奋。真正的原因是，在整个过程中，她始终没有移开与他对视的目光。

"I can tell. He's already ready again." Asuka said as she felt Shinji's member begin to stand at attention again. She leaned up and reached behind her back to grab at his firm cock. She lifted up her hips and guided Shinji's cock into her waiting pussy. She felt it go past her folds and into her, her walls parting to give it space letting it fill her until her ass cheeks were touching his balls and there was no more shaft to take.  
“我能感觉到，他又准备好了。” 明日香说着，感觉到真嗣的阴茎再次挺立起来。她抬起身，伸手到背后抓住他坚硬的肉棒。她抬起臀部，引导真嗣的阴茎进入她等待的小穴。她感觉到它穿过她的褶皱，深入其中，她的肉壁分开为它腾出空间，让它填满她，直到她的臀瓣触碰到他的睾丸，再无多余的空间容纳更多。

With him fully hilted into her Asuka paused for a moment and took in the sight. Both their bodies were covered in a sheen of oil, the glossy luster reflecting off of the low candlelight around them. Her hands rested on his pectorals, the cobalt of his eyes contrasting with the red of the rose petals sprinkled about the bed.  
当真嗣完全插入她体内时，明日香停顿了一下，欣赏着眼前的景象。两人的身体都覆盖着一层油光，在周围的低矮烛光下反射出光泽。她的手放在他的胸肌上，他深蓝色的眼睛与床上散落的红色玫瑰花瓣形成鲜明对比。

'The baka outdid himself today.' She thought as she began to move her hips up and down, slowly at first, before speeding up until she was riding his cock with everything she could muster.  
“这个笨蛋今天真是超常发挥了。”她想着，开始上下摆动臀部，起初缓慢，随后加速，直到她全力以赴地骑乘着他的肉棒。

Shinji's hands went up from his sides and grabbed hold of Asuka's hips as she grinded them onto his trying to get his cock to hit just the right spot. Despite her best efforts at retaining composure Asuka began to let out a series of low moans as she rode his cock. The sight of her oiled breasts bouncing up and down at her exertions was almost too much for Shinji, and he was torn about whether to keep watching this spectacle or to close his eyes, lest he cum too early.  
真嗣的双手从身侧抬起，抓住明日香的臀部，她正努力磨蹭着，试图让他的肉棒触到那个恰到好处的点。尽管她尽力保持镇定，明日香还是开始发出一连串低沉的呻吟，随着她骑乘的动作，她涂满油光的胸部上下弹跳，这一幕几乎让真嗣无法自持，他纠结于是否该继续观赏这番景象，还是闭上眼睛，以免过早射精。

Eventually he did roll his head back, though that didn't help much as it still left him with the feeling of Asuka's tight walls around his member and her moans echoing in the room.  
最终，他还是向后仰头，但这并没有多大帮助，因为他依然能感受到明日香紧致的肉壁环绕着他的阳具，以及她的呻吟在房间里回荡。

'Need…Control…' Shinji thought, as he felt his member about to burst. So he moved his hands up from her sides and moved them around her back, bringing her chest forward to his. He then, with his member still almost hilted inside her, rolled them around so that now he was on top. Shinji paused for a moment and with his right hand swept up several of the rose petals from the bed around them and with his arm straight out in front of them he let them fall. The petals fluttering in the air as they fell down onto Asuka's body. Some fell onto her hair, some on her stomach, one even landed perfectly to cover her left nipple. As the petals fell Shinji, who had calmed down a bit, began to gently stroke his cock in and out of Asuka. She brought up her arms up and took a hold of his face and brought hers and his mouths together giving him a peck on the lips before speaking:  
'需要…控制…' 真嗣想着，感觉到自己的下体即将爆发。于是他将双手从她的两侧移到背后，将她的胸部推向自己。接着，他仍然几乎完全插入她的体内，翻转了他们的位置，现在他处于上方。真嗣停顿了一下，用右手从他们周围的床上扫起几片玫瑰花瓣，伸直手臂让它们飘落。花瓣在空中飘舞，落在明日香的身上。有的落在她的头发上，有的落在她的肚子上，甚至有一片完美地覆盖了她的左乳头。随着花瓣的飘落，真嗣稍微平静了一些，开始轻轻地抽插他的阴茎进出明日香的体内。她抬起双臂，捧住他的脸，将两人的嘴唇凑在一起，给了他一个轻吻，然后说道：

"I got you too excited didn't I?" She said, correctly guessing as to why Shinji changed positions.  
"我让你太兴奋了，对吧？" 她猜到了真嗣为何改变姿势，并正确地说出了原因。

"Yee-ah." Shinji responded, a little embarrassed. Asuka still had a small smile on her face. She'd always known she'd had a great body from the lustful stares and fitful glances from boys when they thought she wasn't looking. While her pride may have wanted her to be praised for skills at piloting an Eva, she took no pleasure in being viewed as a conquest. Many a brave and foolish had been sent with their tail between their legs for trying their luck in asking her out or making an unsolicited and unwanted move.  
“耶——啊。”真嗣略带尴尬地回应道。明日香脸上依旧挂着浅浅的微笑。她一直都知道自己拥有一副好身材，那些男孩自以为她没注意时投来的贪婪目光和闪烁眼神便是明证。虽然她的自尊心或许更希望因驾驶 EVA 的技艺而受到赞誉，但她并不乐意被视为战利品。许多勇敢而愚蠢的家伙，都因试图约她出去或做出未经请求、不受欢迎的举动，而灰溜溜地夹着尾巴离开。

With Shinji though it was different. The gratification she got when she made him blush or excited was unlike anything else she had ever felt. Even before they were together she enjoyed teasing him, but only him, not any of the other perverts who stared slack-jaw at her. Why? His opinion, his feelings, they mattered to her now obviously because she loved him. But before then? Why? How do you know which nebulous feelings in your heart will turn into love? Had it been love at first sight and she had been too afraid to admit it? Was it her respect that he had earned fighting by her side in their shared life and death struggle? She didn't know why her heart had decided to open itself to him. But she's never looked back.  
然而，对于真嗣，情况却截然不同。每当她让他脸红或兴奋时，那种满足感是她从未体验过的。即使在两人在一起之前，她也很享受逗弄他，但仅限于他，而不是那些目瞪口呆盯着她的变态们。为什么？他的意见，他的感受，现在对她显然很重要，因为她爱他。但在此之前呢？为什么？你如何知道心中那些模糊的情感会转化为爱？难道是所谓的一见钟情，而她一直害怕承认？还是因为她对他并肩作战、共同经历生死考验所赢得的尊重？她不知道自己的心为何决定向他敞开。但她从未后悔过。

Asuka was broken from her momentary musings by Shinji taking both her hands in his, their fingers curling tightly around each other's hands. He brought his face down so it was less than an inch from hers. Those cobalt eyes looked at her with longing and love. She closed her eyes and puckered her lips, Shinji responded in kind and they shared a passionate kiss as Shinji began thrusting again. Going from slow strokes and working his way up to powerful rhythmic thrusts that penetrated deep into her.  
由真嗣握住她的双手，两人的手指紧紧交缠，明日香从短暂的沉思中回过神来。他俯下脸庞，距离她的脸颊不到一英寸。那双深蓝色的眼眸带着渴望与爱意凝视着她。她闭上眼睛，噘起嘴唇，真嗣同样回应，两人共享了一个激情的热吻，同时真嗣再次开始挺动。从缓慢的抽插逐渐加速，转为强有力的节奏性深入。

Asuka's legs were up in the air swaying back and forth with each of Shinji's thrusts into her wet and ever-tightening hole. Her toes curled and splayed at the pleasure she felt from his strokes and her moaning, even muffled by their kiss, filled the small bedroom.  
明日香的腿高高抬起，随着真嗣每一次深入她湿润而愈发紧致的私处而前后摇摆。她的脚趾因快感而蜷缩又张开，尽管被吻声掩盖，她的呻吟仍充斥着狭小的卧室。

He broke the kiss and placed his head next to hers, letting her hear his low grunts. She could feel him getting close, his strokes lost their rhythm and instead speed up to a flurry of thrusts into her as his primal lust took over. She crossed her ankles behind the small of his back to keep him in place and tightened her walls around his cock as much as she could. She hadn't reached her peak yet, she was close, so very close.  
他结束了亲吻，将头靠在她的旁边，让她听到他低沉的喘息。她能感觉到他即将达到高潮，他的动作失去了节奏，取而代之的是急促的抽插，原始的欲望占据了他的身体。她交叉脚踝，勾住他的后腰以固定他，并尽可能地收紧围绕着他那坚挺之物的内壁。她还未达到顶峰，她很接近，非常接近。

Finally, one of Shinji's thrusts into her stopped, and as deep as it could go she felt his cockhead throbbing as it unleashed wave after wave of Shinji's seed into her. She felt it impacting her walls and pooling in her pussy. She instinctively tightened her legs around him and brought up her arms around his back in a tight embrace and felt his body shuddering at the intensity of his orgasm. The feeling pushed her over her own crest and Shinji felt her walls tighten around his member and felt her shudder and shake underneath him. Both of them could hear the other panting as they came down from their highs. Asuka turned her head and pecked Shinji on the cheek and rubbed her left hand up and down his back.  
终于，在一次深入的冲刺后，真嗣停了下来，她感觉到他的龟头在她体内跳动，一波又一波地释放着他的种子。她能感受到它撞击着她的内壁，汇聚在她的私处。她本能地收紧双腿环绕着他，双臂紧紧抱住他的背，感受到他在高潮的强烈冲击下颤抖。这种感觉将她推至自己的巅峰，真嗣感觉到她的内壁紧缩着他的阳具，感受到她在他身下颤抖。两人都能听到对方从高潮中平复下来的喘息声。明日香转过头，在真嗣的脸颊上轻轻一吻，用左手上下抚摸着他的背。

Once both of them had come down Asuka undid her legs and Shinji pulled his member out of her. The still semi-hard cock was completely coated in a shiny mixture of her juices and his cum while Shinji managed to look down and see through her gaping opening some of the puddle of cum he had left in her. A bit seeped out onto Asuka's lower lips but she closed her legs before more could leave.  
当两人都平静下来后，明日香松开了双腿，真嗣抽出了他的阳具。那半硬的状态下，他的阴茎完全被她的体液和他的精液混合物覆盖，闪闪发亮。真嗣低头看去，透过她微微张开的私处，能看到他留在她体内的精液池。一些精液渗出，沾在明日香的阴唇上，但她迅速并拢双腿，阻止了更多的流出。

Shinji grabbed the pillows from her bed and set them up on the wall so they could lie down more comfortably. Shinji leaned against the wall, pillow behind him while Asuka rested her head on his chest and their legs tangled together. Content merely with each other's presence and the sound of the other's breathing, until a new sound disrupted the silence.  
真嗣从她的床上抓起几个枕头，靠墙摆好，以便他们能更舒适地躺下。真嗣背靠墙壁，枕头垫在身后，而明日香则将头枕在他的胸前，两人的腿交缠在一起。仅仅享受着彼此的存在和对方的呼吸声，直到一阵新的声响打破了这份宁静。

"What's that?" "那是什么？"

"I set a timer so there'd be time to clean up before Misato got home."  
“我设了个闹钟，这样在美里回来之前我们还有时间收拾一下。”

"Hahaha, yeah if she saw us like this I don't think we'd be able to deny it." Asuka said looking at the mood lighting candles and rose petals scattered around her room. Shinji got up from his comfortable position and stood up next to the bed before turning around:  
“哈哈哈，是啊，如果她看到我们这样，我想我们没法否认了。”明日香看着房间里营造氛围的蜡烛和散落的玫瑰花瓣说道。真嗣从舒适的姿势中起身，站在床边，转过身来：

"Happy 'Valentine's Day' Asuka." Shinji said continuing the joke from before.  
"情人节快乐，明日香。" 真嗣继续着之前的玩笑。

"Happy 'Valentine's Day' Shinji." Asuka responded as she moved toward him and gave him a kiss before getting up herself to help him clean up the mess they made.  
"情人节快乐，真嗣。" 明日香回应着，向他走去并给了他一个吻，随后起身帮他一起清理他们制造的混乱。

Misato Katsuragi came home exhausted and hungry. Shinji had prepared some teriyaki chicken with steamed rice and vegetables which really hit the spot after tense meetings with innumerable budget committees that basically amounted to "We are so far overbudget we could repaint Unit-02 with the red ink in our accountants' books."  
摩砂雪·葛城疲惫又饥饿地回到了家。真嗣准备了一些照烧鸡肉、蒸米饭和蔬菜，这在她与无数预算委员会紧张会议后，确实恰到好处，那些会议基本上就是"我们的预算超支得可以用会计账本上的红字给二号机重新上漆了"。

After a good home cooked meal Misato walked down the hall to her room when she stopped as she smelt something outside of Asuka's room.  
享用完一顿家常美食后，美里沿着走廊走向自己的房间，却在经过明日香的房间时，闻到了一股异样的气味。

'Lavender?' Misato thought as she sniffed the air in the hallway. 'Ah must be a new perfume Asuka bought or something.' Misato thought. Sometimes Occam's Razor is not the quickest way to the correct answer.  
'薰衣草？' 美里在走廊里嗅了嗅，心想，'啊，肯定是明日香新买的香水吧。' 她这样想着。但有时候，奥卡姆剃刀原理并非通往正确答案的最快捷径。

**A/N:** I hope you guys enjoyed this. I debated making this its own separate one-shot but decided it was best to simply make it a chapter in the story. Not sure if that's the best approach. Let me know if you want more specials and if you want them in the story or separate. Much more Lemon heavy. I don't know if this counts as Apocrypha by fanfiction standards but oh well. The next chapter will pick up where Leliel and Co. left off and will be up in due time. Hope you all have a Happy Valentine's Day.  
作者注：希望你们喜欢这一章。我曾考虑将其单独作为一篇短篇发布，但最终决定还是作为故事的一章。不确定这是否是最佳做法。请告诉我是否希望看到更多特别篇，以及是希望它们融入故事还是单独成篇。后续内容会更加侧重于柠檬元素。我不确定这算不算得上是同人小说中的外典，但无所谓了。下一章将承接利利尔等人的剧情，会在适当的时候更新。祝大家情人节快乐。

### Chapter 5 After Math

Shinji Ikari, Third Child, and pilot of Eva Unit-01 woke with a start in the NERV Geofront hospital. Staring at an unfamiliar ceiling. As his eyes came into focus he noticed a head in his field of vision, watching over him like a mother bird would watch over her chicks. 'Asuka?' His mind hoped. 'No this hair is too short and the wrong color.' He thought as his brain finally managed to process the information his senses were giving him.  
碇真嗣，第三适格者，也是 Eva 初号机的驾驶员，在 NERV 地底都市医院的病床上突然惊醒，凝视着陌生的天花板。当他的视线逐渐清晰时，他注意到视野中有一个头颅，像母鸟守护雏鸟一样守护着他。'明日香吗？' 他的内心希望着。'不，这头发太短，颜色也不对。' 他的大脑终于处理完感官传递给他的信息。

"Ah you're awake. You can rest. We'll take care of everything." The blue haired Rei Ayanami said from a chair next to his hospital bed.  
"啊，你醒了。你可以休息。我们会处理好一切。" 蓝发的绫波零从他病床旁的椅子上说道。

"I feel just fine." Shinji replied as he became more aware of his surroundings and regained the ability to use his mouth to form words.  
"我感觉很好。" 真嗣回答道，随着对周围环境的逐渐适应，他恢复了用嘴说话的能力。

"Well, that's good for you." Rei said in a neutral voice as she closed her book and Shinji felt a very odd sense of deja'vu before remembering his prime concern.  
"嗯，那对你来说是好事。" 绫波用中性的声音说道，她合上了书，真嗣感到一种非常奇怪的既视感，随后想起了他首要的担忧。

"Where is Asuka?" Shinji asked as he leaned up in the bed and tried to keep his voice from betraying too much concern.  
“明日香在哪儿？”真嗣从床上撑起身，努力不让自己的声音流露出太多担忧。

Just as the words left his mouth, both he and Rei heard a commotion in the hallway outside his hospital room. Muffled crashes and exceedingly creative and personal German swears could be heard from beyond.  
话音刚落，他和绫波便听到病房外的走廊传来一阵骚动。隐约的撞击声和极具创意且极具个人色彩的德语咒骂从门外传来。

"That's likely her now." Rei said getting up from her chair and opening the door to the corridor just in time for Shinji to see a medical orderly flying face first down the hall, while another impacted the wall across from their now open door. His face bloodied and bruised as a pissed off German redhead repeated her question for the umpteenth time:  
“她可能就在外面。”绫波说着从椅子上起身，打开通往走廊的门，正好让真嗣看到一名医护人员正面朝下飞过走廊，而另一名则撞上了他们敞开的门对面的墙壁。他的脸血迹斑斑，青一块紫一块，而一位愤怒的德国红发少女正第无数次重复她的问题：

"**WHERE IS HE!"**  "他在哪儿！"

The orderly wordlessly pointed toward the now open door as Shinji wondered why NERV hadn't invested in martial arts training for their medical, or honestly all personnel tasked with taking care of the pilots that are masters in hand-to-hand combat.  
那位勤务兵默默地指向已经敞开的门，而真嗣则在想，NERV 为何没有为他们的医疗人员，或者说所有负责照顾这些擅长近身格斗的驾驶员的人员，投资进行武术训练。

"YOU BAKA!" This thought was interrupted as an extremely angry Asuka Langley Sohryu dressed in nothing but a rather revealing hospital gown barged in through the open door. Completely missing Rei, and grabbing the closest metal object she could, an unused bed pan, and raising it menacingly at Shinji "What were you thinking rushing in headlong like that!?" She asked before feeling someone was behind her and turning on her heels to face the First Child "And you Wondergirl!" She said pointing an accusatory finger at Rei and simultaneously giving Shinji an excellent view of her backside through her revealing hospital gown. "What are you doing here?!"  
"你这个笨蛋！"这个念头被一个极度愤怒的明日香·兰格雷打断，她只穿着一件相当暴露的医院病号服，冲进了敞开的门。完全没注意到绫波，她抓起手边最近的金属物品——一个未使用过的便盆，威胁性地举起它对着真嗣大喊："你那样一头冲进来到底在想什么！？"她问道，随即感觉到有人在她身后，便迅速转身面对第一适格者，"还有你，奇迹少女！"她指着绫波，同时用指责的手指指向她，顺便让真嗣透过她那暴露的病号服看到了她的背影。"你在这里干什么？！"

"Watching, Pilot Ikari." Rei responded seemingly giving no heed to the venom or anger in Asuka's words. "I will take my leave now that he has regained consciousness" she said as she stepped into the room's threshold "Goodbye Ikari, Pilot Sohryu." Ayanami spoke in her usual hushed and deadpan tone as she closed the door and left the two of them alone.  
"观察中，一尉真嗣。" 绫波回应道，似乎对明日香话语中的恶意或愤怒毫不在意。"既然他已经恢复意识，我将告退" 她一边说着，一边踏入房间的门槛，"再见，真嗣，惣流驾驶员。" 绫波以她一贯的低沉且平淡的语气说道，随后关上门，留下他们两人独处。

"ARRGHHH!" Asuka screamed as she threw the bed pan wildly, 'accidentally' hitting the camera in the corner of the room. With the camera disabled and moving faster than he had ever seen her move before she locked the door and jumped onto the bed on top of him. Though rather than be excited as he usually was Shinji was terrified as he saw the rage in her eyes.  
"啊啊啊！" 明日香尖叫着，疯狂地将便盆扔出，'不小心'击中了房间角落的摄像头。摄像头失效后，她以比以往任何时候都快的速度锁上门，跳上床扑向他。然而，与平时不同，真嗣并未感到兴奋，而是惊恐地看到了她眼中的怒火。

"You bastard!" Asuka said as she beat her fists down on his chest, one, two, three times, Shinji wincing in pain. "I was so worried about you!" Asuka said as the corners of her eyes began to water and a tear fell along with the fourth punch on Shinji's sternum.  
"你这个混蛋！" 明日香说着，拳头重重地落在他的胸口，一次，两次，三次，真嗣痛苦地皱眉。"我那么担心你！" 明日香说道，眼角开始泛起泪光，第四拳伴随着泪水落在真嗣的胸骨上。

Shinji grabbed Asuka's fist on his chest and reached his other hand behind her back pulling her into a tight embrace. She tried to move, tried to strike him again but he held her firm. Her breaths, heavy and deep, were muffled by Shinji's hospital gown covered chest as she fought back tears. He could her a few sobs and barely audible swears before she lifted up her face to look at him. Shinji released her from his hold as she brought her hands up to wipe at her eyes rather than hit him again.  
真嗣抓住了放在他胸口的明日香的手，另一只手绕到她背后，将她紧紧拥入怀中。她试图挣脱，试图再次打他，但他紧紧抱住她不放。她的呼吸沉重而深沉，被真嗣的病号服覆盖的胸膛闷住了，她强忍着泪水。他听到几声抽泣和几乎听不见的咒骂，然后她抬起脸来看着他。真嗣松开了她，她抬起手来擦眼睛，而不是再次打他。

"I'm sorry Asuka." Shinji said, falling back on his habitual line, though injecting it with as much sincerity as he could before continuing: "I'm so glad you're okay."  
"对不起，明日香。" 真嗣说道，用上了他惯常的道歉，尽管他尽可能地注入真诚，然后继续说："我很高兴你没事。"

"Baka." Asuka said in a quiet almost empty voice, seemingly having calmed down from her earlier rampage.  
"笨蛋。" 明日香用一种几乎空洞的平静声音说道，似乎已经从之前的暴怒中平息下来。

"I won't leave you alone in this world Asuka." Shinji said placing a soft kiss on Asuka's forehead as he brought up his hand and his right thumb cleared away the last remnant of tears from her eyes.  
"我不会让你独自面对这个世界的，明日香。" 真嗣说着，轻轻吻在明日香的额头上，同时抬起手，用右拇指拭去她眼角的最后一滴泪。

"You better not." Asuka said grabbing his hand that rested on her cheek. Her confidence and fire returning to her voice. They stayed like that for a moment, taking in the feeling of holding the other in their arms. Feeling the warmth of each other's skin, the light from the Geofront's reflective panels glinting off their eyes.  
"你最好别。" 明日香抓住他抚在脸颊上的手，声音中恢复了自信与热情。他们就这样相拥片刻，感受着彼此怀抱中的温暖，地底都市反射板的光线在他们眼中闪烁。

"Kiss me and I might just forgive you for chatting with wondergirl rather than coming to find me." Asuka said giving a not-so-playful pinch to his side and bringing them both back to reality after the cascade of emotions had subsided.  
"吻我，我或许会原谅你和那个完美女孩聊天而不是来找我。" 明日香说着，在他腰侧不轻不重地捏了一下，将两人从情绪的洪流中拉回现实。

"I'd just woken up myself when I heard the commotion you were causing in the hall." Shinji said defensively before asking his next question that he already knew the answer to in his heart but wanted to hear the words: "Why'd you do that?"  
"我刚醒来就听到你在走廊里闹出的动静。" 真嗣辩解道，随后问出了那个他心中已有答案却渴望亲耳听到的问题："你为什么要那么做？"

"I just wanted to see you again." Asuka answered as she moved her hands to the side of his head, puckered her lips and closed her eyes. Shinji reciprocated and they shared a long, soft kiss as their lips met. After the shadow it was cathartic, both now knew without a doubt they were back in the real world that the other was real and not some facsimile. These thoughts came to Shinji's mind and as the kiss ended he voiced them to Asuka:  
"我只是想再见到你。" 明日香回答着，双手移到他的头侧，噘起嘴唇，闭上了眼睛。真嗣回应着，他们的唇轻轻相触，共享了一个漫长而温柔的吻。经历了那片阴影后，这吻具有宣泄的意义，两人此刻都确信无疑，他们回到了现实世界，对方是真实存在的，而非某种复制品。这些念头在真嗣心中浮现，随着吻的结束，他向明日香表达了这些想法：

"I had the strangest dream in there." Shinji's words made Asuka's heart stop before she responded:  
"我在那里做了一个最奇怪的梦。" 真嗣的话让明日香的心跳停了一拍，随后她回应道：

"We were on a train and relived our relationship." Asuka said as she recalled the strange out-of-body experience she had had in the shadow.  
"我们在一列火车上，重温了我们的关系。" 明日香回忆起她在阴影中经历的那场奇异的灵魂出窍体验时说道。

"How did y-" Shinji asked somewhat befuddled, his brain not putting the pieces together as quickly as Asuka's had.  
"你怎么——" 真嗣有些困惑地问道，他的大脑没能像明日香那样迅速地将事情串联起来。

"I had the same one baka." Asuka said, though as the gears in her mind turned she wasn't sure it was entirely a dream, she and Shinji would need to compare notes more thoroughly later. But for now she had a more important question on her mind. A **much** more important one. "Did you see your mother?" Shinji began to nod in response but before he could vocalize a positive response the hospital door was nearly banged off its hinges by an irate Major Katsuragi.  
"我也做了同样的梦，笨蛋。" 明日香说，尽管随着思绪的转动，她不确定那完全是一场梦，她和真嗣需要稍后更彻底地核对笔记。但眼下她心中有一个更重要的问题。一个极其重要的问题。"你见到你母亲了吗？" 真嗣开始点头回应，但还没等他发出肯定的回应，医院的门就被一位愤怒的葛城美里少校几乎撞开了。

"Asuka! WHAT THE HELL! Open up this door RIGHT NOW!" Misato screamed through the door, it barely muffling the anger in her voice.  
"明日香！搞什么鬼！马上给我开门！" 美里透过门大喊，声音中的怒气几乎未被门板减弱。

"Say nothing" Asuka mimed wordlessly with her lips as she leapt off Shinji to the side of the bed. "I love you" She whispered into his ear as she slapped him hard across the cheek before strutting over to the door and unlocking it for Misato who entered just as Asuka went into full tirade mode: "If you ever do something so stupid agai-!" She began before Major Katsuragi cut her off.  
"别说话" 明日香无声地用唇语示意，随即从真嗣身上跳下，来到床边。"我爱你" 她在他耳边低语，然后狠狠地扇了他一巴掌，才大步走向门口，为美里开门。美里一进门，明日香就爆发了："如果你再做这么愚蠢的事——！" 她刚开口，就被葛城美里少校打断了。

"What are you doing Asuka!" The clearly worse-for-wear NERV Operations Director said as she entered the room in her usual red jacket and miniskirt combo and stood directly in front of the erring redhead giving her her best commander stare.  
"你在干什么，明日香！" 显然状态不佳的 NERV 作战部长说道，她穿着惯常的红色夹克和迷你裙，径直站在犯错的赤木面前，用她最严厉的指挥官眼神盯着她。

"I had to give this baka a chewing out for rushing out and getting me sucked into that Angel!" Asuka said not backing down and trying to sell the ruse as she stared straight into the purple-haired woman's eyes.  
"我得把这个笨蛋狠狠骂一顿，他这么急匆匆地跑出去，害得我也被卷进了那个使徒！" 明日香毫不退让，试图让这个谎言显得逼真，她直视着紫发女子的眼睛。

'Did she have to be so violent?' Shinji wondered during the whole thing as he rubbed at the painful red handprint on his face as the women bickered. He understood the necessity of keeping up the charade but still…  
'她非得这么暴力吗？' 真嗣在整个争吵过程中暗自思忖，他揉着脸上疼痛的红手印，女人们还在争吵。他明白维持假象的必要性，但还是……

"Hello Misato, Kaji, it's good to see you both." Shinji said quietly as he noticed the unshaven man leaning in the doorway behind Misato and found his voice.  
"你好，美里小姐，加持先生，很高兴见到你们。" 真嗣轻声说道，他注意到美里身后那个未刮胡子的男人倚在门口，终于找到了自己的声音。

"Hey Shinji, Asuka." The nonchalant spy said as he entered the room.  
"嘿，真嗣，明日香。" 这位漫不经心的间谍一边说着一边走进房间。

"Kaji! You came to see me!" Asuka said in her most schoolgirl voice as he entered her field of vision before remembering she was supposed to be mad and turned back to Misato: "If you ask me he ought to be grounded!" The angry German redhead said as she pointed a finger full of blame at Shinji.  
"加持先生！你来看我了！" 明日香用她最像女学生的声音说道，当加持进入她的视线时，她突然想起自己应该生气，于是转回对美里说："要我说，他应该被禁足！" 这位愤怒的德国红发女孩说着，用充满指责的手指向真嗣。

"Both of you are grounded!" Misato barked in her Major's voice.  
"你们两个都被禁足了！" 美里用她少校的口吻厉声说道。

"What!? but WH-?!" Asuka began in her most furious tone. She had been about to pounce on Kaji's arm before Misato's words halted her in her tracks.  
“什么！？但为——？”明日香用她最愤怒的语气开口道。她正要扑向加持的手臂，却被美里的话硬生生止住了动作。

"It's not because of what you did during sortie, or what you did to poor Ishikawa and Sato" Misato said, her right hand held up to prevent any objections as she interrupted Asuka's rage and gave names to the two orderlies she had battered in her rampage to see Shinji before continuing: "It's not my decision, both your Evas are on a freeze order straight from the UN Committee that oversees NERV."  
“不是因为你出击时做的事，也不是因为你对可怜的石川和佐藤做了什么。”美里说道，她举起右手阻止任何异议，打断了明日香的怒火，并提到了那两名在她疯狂冲向真嗣前殴打过的医护人员，接着说：“这不是我的决定，你们的 EVA 都被联合国监督 NERV 的委员会直接下达了冻结令。”

"Why Misato?" Shinji asked. His voice much calmer than the two women in the room.  
“为什么，美里？”真嗣问道。他的声音比房间里的两位女性平静得多。

"What do you two remember from when you were in the Angel's shadow?" Misato responded to his question by asking her own question. Both Shinji and Asuka gave a rather furtive glance to each other. They remembered quite a bit of the ordeal but considering it was all about their personal life that they did NOT want to talk about they both kind of shrugged.  
"你们俩还记得在天使的阴影下时发生了什么吗？" 美里对他的问题回应了一个自己的问题。真嗣和明日香彼此交换了一个相当躲闪的眼神。他们记得那段经历的许多细节，但考虑到那都是些他们不想提及的私生活，两人都只是耸了耸肩。

"To be honest I can't remember much. Considering the oxygen-deprivation at the end I can't say for sure whether anything was a memory or a hallucination." Asuka said much more thoughtfully and quietly as the weight of not being able to pilot for the time-being, came down on her with all its weight. Or that's what she wanted Misato to think at least. While Asuka may have been pissed about losing her pilot status, even if just for the moment, she wasn't about to find a bathtub and some razor blades. She had her baka still.  
"老实说，我记不太清楚了。考虑到最后氧气不足，我无法确定哪些是记忆，哪些是幻觉。" 明日香更加深思熟虑且轻声地说道，因为暂时无法驾驶的沉重压力压在了她身上。至少，这是她希望美里所认为的。尽管明日香对于失去驾驶员身份感到愤怒，即使只是暂时的，她也不打算找个浴缸和剃刀片。她还有她的笨蛋在。

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

"Sorry Misato. It's all just kind of a blur. I remember being in the entry plug and maybe sleeping a bit but beyond that I can't say." Shinji said doing his best to seem clueless, which wasn't hard since that was pretty much standard in his life and relationships with people. Well most people anyways.  
"对不起，美里。一切都模模糊糊的。我只记得在插入栓里，可能还睡了一会儿，但除此之外我记不清了。" 真嗣尽力装作一无所知，这并不难，因为这在他的生活和人际关系中几乎是常态。嗯，大多数人都是这样。

"Okay. The committee wanted to interview the both of you about your experience but I can see that it wouldn't amount to much." Misato said finally dropping her Major Katsuragi persona, before adding: "And I'm so glad your both alright." Her head drooping and her dark hair obscuring her face. The momentary silence was ended however as an auburn flash crossed the room.  
"好吧。委员会原本想就你们的经历进行面谈，但我觉得这不会有什么结果。" 美里终于放下了她那葛城美里少校的架子，接着补充道："我真的很高兴你们俩都平安无事。" 她的头低垂着，深色的头发遮住了她的脸。然而，短暂的沉默被一抹赤褐色打破了，它迅速掠过房间。

"Kaji!" Asuka said as she carried out her earlier plan of pouncing on the helpless UN 'Inspector' "What am I going to do now! You still like me right!" She said exasperated, really trying to sell the whole act. But before Kaji could answer, or Misato could pry the redhead off her man 'Oh no you don't you little…' were the words going through her mind at the time I believe. Shinji spoke up:  
"加持！" 明日香按照之前的计划，扑向了无助的联合国"督察" "我现在该怎么办！你还喜欢我对吧！" 她焦急地说道，真的在努力演好这场戏。但还没等加持回答，或者美里能把红发女孩从他身上拉开——'哦不，你休想，你这个小……' 我想当时她的脑海里正闪过这些念头。真嗣开口了：

"Umm Asuka, you know your gown doesn't have a back right?"  
"嗯，明日香，你知道你的礼服没有后背吗？"

"Pervert!" Asuka screamed, her face red as she let go of Kaji and grabbed the sheet of Shinji's bed and wrapped it around herself. Of course she had known it didn't have a back. Just because they were secret lovers and each other's confidantes didn't mean she had stopped enjoying teasing him. It just took on a different flavor.  
“变态！”明日香尖叫着，脸红得像熟透的苹果，她松开加持的手，抓起真嗣床上的床单裹在自己身上。当然，她知道那床单没有背面。即便他们是秘密恋人，彼此的知己，这并不意味着她停止了逗弄他的乐趣。只是这乐趣有了不同的滋味。

"Get dressed." Misato said with a small smile in her face at her adopted kids antics, as she turned around and headed toward the door. "I'll record some affidavits for the UN and then Kaji will take you home."  
“快穿上衣服。”美里带着一丝微笑对她的养子们的行为说道，然后转过身向门口走去。“我会为联合国记录一些宣誓书，然后加持会送你们回家。”

Grumbling and cursing under her breath, Asuka went back to her own room with Misato and got changed into a yellow sundress. Later they both were summoned in one at a time into a conference room with Misato where she recorded their experiences. Combined there was maybe eight minutes of audio as both the pilots were deliberately vague about the ordeal. Afterwards they were released from the hospital and Kaji drove them home. Asuka riding shotgun of course, marveling at how good a driver Kaji was while Shinji rolled his eyes in the backseat of the nondescript car at the sham of it all.  
明日香一边低声抱怨咒骂，一边跟着美里回到自己的房间，换上了一条黄色的太阳裙。随后，她们被逐一召入一个会议室，与美里一起记录她们的遭遇。两人的叙述加起来可能只有八分钟，两位驾驶员都故意对那次经历含糊其辞。之后，她们被医院释放，加持开车送她们回家。明日香当然坐在副驾驶座上，惊叹于加持的驾驶技术，而真嗣则在不起眼的车后座上翻着白眼，对这一切的虚伪表示不屑。

As they arrived in the apartment they all agreed a good meal would do them good. But as they looked through the kitchen and the pantry they discovered a distinct lack of edible food. With Kaji even remarking under his breath:  
当他们抵达公寓时，大家都觉得一顿美餐会让他们心情好转。然而，当他们翻遍厨房和食品储藏室后，却发现明显缺少可食用的食物。甚至连加持都忍不住低声抱怨：

"A Japanese kitchen that doesn't even have rice? Katsuragi you haven't changed a bit." Shinji had been meaning to go the store before the previous battle with the 12th Angel but hadn't had the chance, and since it had just been Misato in the apartment since then…well… Ordering take-out would only delay the problem. So Kaji offered: "I'll go to the store, why don't you two get some rest." Before turning to face Shinji. "There's a store across the street right?"  
“一个日本厨房居然连米都没有？葛城，你一点都没变。”真嗣本打算在之前与第 12 使徒的战斗前去商店采购，但一直没找到机会，而且自那以后公寓里只有美里一个人……嗯……叫外卖只能暂时缓解问题。于是加持提议：“我去商店买吧，你们俩先休息一下。”随后转向真嗣问道：“街对面有家商店对吧？”

"No go to the Kaguya Market, the only thing fresh in that convenience store is the ramen." Asuka said. Sending him a further block and a half away from the apartment.  
“不，去辉夜市场，那家便利店里唯一新鲜的就是拉面。”明日香说道，让他又多走了一百五十米远的路程。

"Alright Asuka, I guess a proper home-cooked meal would be best." Kaji said in agreement. "What does the resident chef think we should have?" He continued turning his attention back to Shinji.  
"好的，明日香，我想一顿家常菜最合适不过了。" 加持赞同地说道，"我们的主厨觉得我们应该吃什么呢？" 他转头看向真嗣。

"Well if you're going there, get the basics, miso, rice, noodles, and some chicken and I'll make us chicken katsu." Shinji offered knowing it was Asuka's favorite Japanese dish. Though calling chicken katsu Japanese is like calling a California roll authentic sushi. Eh, cultural blending and exchange I guess.  
"既然你这么说，那就准备些基本食材吧，味噌、米饭、面条，还有鸡肉，我来给大家做炸猪排。" 真嗣提议道，他知道这是明日香最喜欢的日本料理。虽然把炸猪排称为日本料理，有点像把加州卷当成正宗寿司。嗯，文化融合与交流吧，我想。

"Mhm." Kaji said as he thought about homemade katsu. "Any preference with the basics?" He asked as he walked towards the front door.  
"嗯。" 加持想着自制炸猪排，"对这些基本食材有什么特别要求吗？" 他边问边走向前门。

"If you're getting noodles then try and get the buckwheat ones." Asuka said as her mind blanked on the proper Japanese name for soba noodles. Languages are hard sometimes even for a genius.  
"如果你要买面条，那就试试荞麦面吧。" 明日香说着，脑海中一时想不起荞麦面的日语名称。语言有时对天才来说也挺难的。

"Alright, I'll be back kids." Kaji said as he made his way across the threshold and into the outside world.  
"好了，孩子们，我很快就回来。" 加持说着，跨过门槛，走进了外面的世界。

"We've got twenty, maybe thirty minutes max." Shinji said as the door closed behind Kaji.  
"我们大概有二十分钟，最多三十分钟。" 真嗣说道，门在加持身后关上了。

"Plenty of time." The German redhead said grabbing his hand and dragging him down the hallway by the bathroom. She couldn't wait to get him to one of their beds so once they were out of sight of the front door. She spun around, furiously undid the belt of his pants and dropped to her knees.  
"时间多得是。" 这位德国红发女子说着，抓住他的手，拉着他沿着走廊向浴室方向走去。她迫不及待地想把他带到他们的床边，一旦他们远离了前门视线，她便猛地转身，急切地解开他裤子的腰带，随即跪了下来。

Shinji was, or rather had been wearing a pair of blue pants and a grey shirt Misato had brought to the hospital from the apartment. The pants and boxers made a loose pile around his ankles as Asuka grabbed his flaccid member with her nimble fingers. She used her left hand to stroke at his balls, her fingers each gliding across his wrinkly sack as she cupped it in her hand while her other gave his member several strokes before she took the stiffening though still soft member in her mouth. There was no time for foreplay, she needed him hard now.  
真嗣穿着一条蓝色裤子和一件灰色衬衫，这是美里从公寓带到医院的。裤子和内裤松松垮垮地堆在他的脚踝周围，而明日香用她灵巧的手指抓住了他软绵绵的部位。她用左手抚摸着他的睾丸，手指轻轻滑过他皱巴巴的阴囊，同时右手则在他逐渐硬起的阴茎上快速上下滑动，然后她将那虽已变硬但仍柔软的阴茎含入口中。没有时间前戏了，她现在就需要他硬起来。

Shinji hadn't seen being in the backseat and Kaji had had his eyes on the road but during the entire car ride to the Katsuragi apartment Asuka had kept her knees together and rocked her hips back and forth, grinding her pussy into the car seat to try and control herself.  
真嗣没有注意到后座的情况，而加持则一直注视着前方道路，但在整个前往葛城公寓的车程中，明日香始终并拢双膝，来回摇摆臀部，将她的阴部摩擦在汽车座椅上，试图控制自己的欲望。

She wanted him. Bad. If Misato hadn't come when she did she probably would have taken him right in the hospital.  
她渴望他，非常渴望。如果不是美里及时赶到，她可能已经在医院里把他占有了。

Shinji's entire groin area felt like it was the center of an electrical storm as the nerves shot lightning between themselves and his brain at the stimulation Asuka was giving him. His balls quickly retreated from their hanging position and tightened at the base of his rapidly hardening cock. Asuka was going all-out. Her lips and tongue were swirling around his cockhead while her right hand was stroking at his shaft, her wrist twisting in a circular motion. Her hand squeezing just enough to excite his cock but not so hard as to be painful, something you only learn how to do after being with someone for a long time.  
真嗣的整个腹股沟区域感觉就像是一场电闪雷鸣的中心，神经在刺激下如闪电般在彼此和大脑之间穿梭。他的睾丸迅速从悬挂的位置缩回，紧贴在他迅速硬挺的阴茎根部。明日香全力以赴。她的唇舌围绕着他的龟头旋转，而右手则在他的阴茎上上下滑动，手腕以圆周运动扭转。她的手握得恰到好处，既能激发他的欲望，又不至于造成疼痛，这种技巧只有在长时间与某人相处后才能学会。

After some minutes of her head bobbing up and down Shinji was hard enough. In one motion she stood up from her kneeling position, reached her hands under her dress and pulled down her plain white panties. Lifting her feet up one at a time to get them off Asuka was suddenly pushed up against the wall. She looked up just as Shinji's hands pinned hers high on the wall, her panties now scrunched up in a ball in her right hand. She looked into his cobalt eyes and the burning lust on his not-quite-scowling brow. 'Maybe I overdid it with all the teasing.' She thought as she puckered her lips, pushed her head away from the wall and closed her eyes. She was rewarded by his soft lips on hers, his tongue pushing his way into her mouth before it softened its quest for dominance and merely twirled around hers, her own tongue reciprocating the action. Eventually the kiss ended and they pulled away and looked at one another. He still had that look of lust, resolve and will power but it had softened a bit, while to Shinji, Asuka had a look just like she had had the night before their battle with the 7th Angel, just a girl wanting to feel loved holding on to those precious few memories she had lest they fall into the abyss. Though this time she was awake of course. Or were they?  
几分钟后，她的头上下晃动让真嗣硬了起来。她一下子从跪姿中站起，伸手到裙下拉下她那条朴素的白色内裤。抬起脚一只接一只地脱掉，就在这时，明日香突然被推到墙上。她抬头一看，真嗣的双手已将她的手按在墙上，她的内裤此刻揉成一团握在右手中。她凝视着他那双钴蓝色的眼睛，以及他那未完全皱起的眉间燃烧的欲望。'也许我对所有的挑逗做得太过火了。'她想着，噘起嘴唇，将头从墙上移开，闭上了眼睛。她得到了回应，他的柔软双唇贴上了她的，舌头探入她的口中，随后放缓了征服的追求，只是与她的舌头缠绵交织，她的舌头也回应着同样的动作。最终，亲吻结束，他们分开，彼此对视。 他依旧带着那种欲望、决心和意志力的表情，但已稍稍柔和了一些。而对真嗣来说，明日香的神情就像他们在与第七使徒战斗前夜一样，只是一个渴望被爱的女孩，紧紧抓住那些珍贵的记忆，生怕它们坠入深渊。当然，这次她是醒着的。或者，他们真的醒着吗？

They both needed this. Especially after that ordeal with the last angel. Sure they had kissed each other, felt each other's touch, and heard each other's voice, but they had to do this, to know absolutely that it was actually the other here, in this place and not just another duplicate, another memory, another scenario.  
他们都需要这个。尤其是在经历了与最后一个使徒的磨难之后。当然，他们曾亲吻过彼此，感受过对方的触摸，听到过对方的声音，但他们必须这样做，以绝对确认对方真的在这里，在这个地方，而不是另一个复制品，另一个记忆，另一个场景。

He let go of her left hand so he could bring his right hand down to guide his throbbing member into her, as he waddled forward to her with his feet confined as they were. Asuka's left hand meanwhile hiked up her dress as she parted her legs and maneuvered her hips to give Shinji the access he needed. As the tip of his cock pushed past her moist labia with the help of leftover spit from her blowjob Shinji grabbed her leg, holding it up while Asuka wrapped her left arm around the back of Shinji's neck to help brace herself.  
他松开了她的左手，以便用右手引导自己勃起的部位进入她，同时双脚受限地蹒跚前行。与此同时，明日香用左手提起裙摆，分开双腿，扭动臀部为真嗣腾出空间。在他的阴茎在她的口交留下的唾液帮助下穿过她湿润的小阴唇时，真嗣抓住了她的腿，将它抬起，而明日香则用左手环住真嗣的脖子，帮助自己稳住身体。

Shinji didn't exactly thrust his cock into her pussy, but he wasn't as careful as he usually was either. The result was the same however.  
真嗣并没有真正地猛插她的阴部，但他也没有平时那么小心翼翼。然而，结果是一样的。

Fullness. 充实感。

Completeness. 完整性。

Reassurance. 安心感。

They were really back. This wasn't a mirage like the fever dream before.  
他们真的回来了。这次不是像之前发烧时那样的幻觉。

With his legs restricted by his pants around his ankles all Shinji could do was thrust his hips back and forth, but that was enough. His length slid in and out of her. His strokes exciting the nerves on the walls of her vagina. The thrusting of his hips causing her back to scrape against the wall. His cock plunging in deeper each time. Her hitched breathing adding to the symphony of fabric rubbing against a wall and the smacking of soft, supple flesh.  
由于双腿被裤脚束缚在脚踝处，真嗣只能来回摆动臀部，但这已足够。他的坚挺在她体内进出，每一次抽插都刺激着她阴道壁上的神经。他臀部的撞击使她的背部刮擦着墙壁。每一次深入都让他的阴茎更加深入。她急促的呼吸声，加上布料摩擦墙壁的声音和柔软肉体的拍打声，构成了一曲交响乐。

The fingers of her right hand bit ever harder into the fabric of the panties it was holding, the force leaving likely permanent marks on the plain material. They had had quickies before, but never as intense as this. Asuka moved her head from the wall and put her mouth next to Shinji's ear, nibbling the earlobe and giving him goosebumps up and down his body even as he kept up the rhythm of his thrusts.  
她右手的手指更加用力地掐入紧握的内裤布料中，力度之大可能在朴素的材质上留下了永久的痕迹。他们之前也有过快速激情，但从未如此激烈。明日香将头从墙上移开，将嘴凑近真嗣的耳边，轻咬着耳垂，让他全身起鸡皮疙瘩，而他的抽插节奏却丝毫未减。

"_Mein Leibling"_ Asuka whispered into his ear, "_sei eins mit mir"_. She could feel him getting close, but she already knew she would reach her peak first, 'just…a few…more…strokes…'  
"“我的宝贝”，明日香在他耳边低语，“与我合一”。她能感觉到他即将达到高潮，但她已经知道她会先一步达到顶峰，“就…再…几…下…”

'Oh fuck.' Shinji thought. But it was not in pleasure as he felt her walls squeeze around his shaft as her body shuddered against his. It was in terror. Shinji quickly pulled his dick out of Asuka's pussy, he had barely been able to hold back when he felt her come and now he released his load on her thigh. Four spurts of sticky cum shot out from his tip onto her leg former two splotches that if left alone would eventually mold into a "V" shape.  
“哦，该死。”真嗣心想。但这并非出于愉悦，而是恐惧，因为她体内的紧致包裹着他的分身，她的身体在他身上颤抖。真嗣迅速从明日香的私处抽出自己的阴茎，当感觉到她高潮时，他几乎无法克制，现在他在她的大腿上释放了精液。四股粘稠的精液从他的顶端射出，落在她的腿上，前两团污迹如果不处理，最终会形成一个“V”形。

"Why…?" Asuka began sounding almost heartbroken as she looked at the viscous white substance on her left leg. 'That was supposed to be for me.' She thought in her bittersweet afterglow before Shinji's voice brought her back to the world.  
“为什么……？”明日香开口道，声音几乎带着心碎，她看着左腿上黏稠的白色物质。‘那本该是给我的。’她在甜蜜而苦涩的余韵中想着，直到真嗣的声音将她拉回现实。

"Asuka we were in the Angel for nearly a day and in the hospital for who knows how long." Shinji began, Asuka still not seeing the point. "You missed taking your pill."  
“明日香，我们在使徒体内几乎待了一整天，又在医院里不知待了多久。”真嗣开始解释，明日香仍未明白重点。“你错过了吃药的时间。”

Shinji's words brought sudden clarity to Asuka's mind and her eyes got wide at the ramifications if Shinji hadn't remembered.  
真嗣的话突然让明日香心中一片清明，如果真嗣没有记起来的后果让她瞪大了眼睛。

"Fuck, and I call you the baka." Asuka said as she leaned her head back against the wall and hit it against the hard surface a few times for good measure.  
“该死，我还说你是笨蛋呢。”明日香说着，将头靠在墙上，用力地撞了几下以示强调。

"We've got to be more caref-" Shinji began as they both heard the apartment door open.  
“我们得更小心——”真嗣刚开口，两人就听到了公寓门打开的声音。

"I'm back!" Kaji said from the doorway.  
"我回来了！" 加持站在门口说道。

'Oh fuck, oh shit, oh fuck.' Both their minds raced. But Asuka being a genius was quick on her feet. She took the panties in her hand and wiped Shinji's cum off her leg with them before shoving them into his hands and pushing him through the semi-open door of the nearby bathroom. With his pants still around his ankles it was a miracle the uncoordinated boy didn't fall over. Asuka gathered what composure she could and tried to straighten out her dress as much as possibly before going out to meet Kaji.  
'哦天哪，糟糕，天哪。' 两人的思绪飞速运转。但明日香作为天才，反应迅速。她拿起内裤，用它们擦掉了腿上的精液，然后塞到真治手里，把他推进了半开的浴室门。他的裤子还在脚踝处，这个笨手笨脚的男孩没有摔倒简直是奇迹。明日香尽量恢复镇定，尽可能整理好裙子，然后走出去迎接加持。

"Food!" Asuka yelped in excitement as she came out of the hallway and into the kitchen area.  
"食物！" 明日香兴奋地从走廊走进厨房。

"Hi Asuka. What happened to your hair?" Kaji asked as he turned around and saw Asuka's usually pristine hair matted and staticky like someone had rubbed balloons on the back of it. Thinking quickly Asuka responded:  
"嗨，明日香。你的头发怎么了？" 加持转过身来，看到明日香平时整洁的头发变得凌乱不堪，像是有人在她背后摩擦了气球一样。明日香迅速反应道：

"Oh Kaji I was just so tired I lied down on my bed without thinking, now my hair is ruined, don't look at it!" She wailed trying her best to be the overly-dramatic crush she had been back in Germany.  
"哦，加持，我只是太累了，没多想就躺在了床上，现在我的头发全毁了，别看了！" 她哀嚎着，尽力扮演回在德国时那个过度戏剧化的暗恋对象。

"Okay Asuka." The perpetually unshaven and grinning man said after a light chuckle.  
"好吧，明日香。" 那个总是胡子拉碴、面带微笑的男人轻笑一声后说道。

"If I'd have known it would do this to my hair with you here I never would have lied down." Asuka said lying through her teeth as she continued the act, hoping that Kaji despite his experience as an intelligence operative would believe the more plausible lie than dig deeper. Now that Asuka thought about it she and Shinji had up until now been stupidly successful at bullshitting their appointed authority figures and peers. Misato, Ritsuko, Section 2, all the kids at school, NERV and basically everyone in the world sans Hikari, had bought their act. Whether that was because they were good at hiding it or no one cared enough was an open question.  
"如果早知道和你在一起会让我的头发变成这样，我绝不会躺下。" 明日香咬着牙撒谎，继续演戏，希望尽管经验丰富的情报人员加持能相信这个更可信的谎言，而不是深究。现在想想，她和真嗣至今在糊弄指定的权威人物和同龄人方面都愚蠢地成功了。美里、律子、第二课、学校里的所有孩子、NERV，以及世界上几乎所有人，除了光，都相信了他们的表演。是因为他们擅长隐藏，还是根本没人足够关心，这是个未解之谜。

"Where's Shinji?" Kaji said, seemingly satisfied with Asuka's answer, as he placed the bags of groceries on the kitchen table and began unpacking and sorting them.  
"真嗣在哪儿？" 加持似乎对明日香的回答感到满意，他将购物袋放在厨房桌上，开始拆包整理。

"What am I? The baka's keeper!" Asuka almost screamed, trying her best to inject her old fire into her voice. Just then they heard a flush come from the bathroom.  
"我是什么？那个笨蛋的监护人吗！" 明日香几乎尖叫起来，尽力在声音中注入她往日的火气。就在这时，他们听到浴室里传来冲水的声音。

"Were you doing perverted things in there baka!" Asuka asked accusatorily while pointing her finger at Shinji as he came down the hall to where they were standing in the kitchen. Shinji stood there with a dumbfounded bewildered look on his face as he stammered out a response:  
"你在里面做变态的事情吗，笨蛋！" 明日香指着从走廊走来的真嗣，语气中带着指责。真嗣站在那里，脸上露出茫然无措的表情，结结巴巴地回应道：

"No… Asuka, I was… just…going to the bathroom." He finished before directing his gaze to Kaji desperately trying to change the subject. "Welcome back Kaji. Did you find everything alright?" Shinji asked regaining a bit of composure.  
"不……明日香，我只是……去洗手间。" 他说完，急忙将目光转向加持，试图转移话题。"欢迎回来，加持先生。一切都顺利吗？" 真嗣恢复了一些镇定，问道。

"Everything except the Soba noodles, so I got some Udon instead." Kaji said as he placed the packet of noodles on the kitchen table.  
"除了荞麦面，其他都找到了，所以我买了些乌冬面。" 加持说着，将一包面条放在厨房桌上。

"Great I'll get dinner started then." Shinji said as Asuka pouted that she didn't get her favorite noodles.  
“太好了，那我开始准备晚饭。” 真嗣说道，而明日香则因为没吃到她最喜欢的面条而撅起了嘴。

In less than an hour a spread of rice, miso, and chicken katsu beckoned for the three of them while Misato's sat in the oven. During that time Asuka had managed to get a new pair of panties on and retrieved the balled up and lightly washed panties that Shinji had stuffed in his pocket while Kaji was distracted by Pen Pen's antics.  
不到一个小时，一桌米饭、味噌汤和炸鸡块就摆好了，等待着他们三人享用，而美里小姐的则在烤箱里。在这段时间里，明日香设法穿上了一条新内裤，并取回了真嗣在卡兹被企鹅潘潘的滑稽动作分心时塞进口袋里的那团轻洗过的内裤。

'Glad there are no gusts of wind indoors. Otherwise that would have been embarrassing.' Asuka thought back to when she'd first seen Shinji all those months ago on the _Over the Rainbow_, the kind of person she had been, the kind of person he had been. Her thoughts, and though she didn't know it at the time, Shinji's as well drifted back to their experience inside. 'It almost seemed like it wanted to know who we are. But why?'  
“幸好室内没有风，否则那可就尴尬了。” 明日香回想起几个月前在彩虹之上第一次见到真嗣的情景，那时的她，那时的他。她的思绪，尽管当时她并不知情，还有真嗣的思绪，都飘回到了他们在内部的体验。“它似乎想知道我们是谁。但为什么呢？”

Now both Asuka and Shinji are at their core good people. Shinji possesses immense empathy and a strong sense of right, though his depression was on the verge of making him jaded and cynical, overriding his innate empathy. Asuka had buried her true and caring self behind abrasive walls thinking it would stop her from being the best. Since if even her own parents didn't care, why should anyone else unless she was the best. And the only way to be best was to be strong. And if she needed help from others it would mean she was weak, and nobody loved weak people, they were cast aside, only the best deserved love.  
如今，无论是明日香还是真嗣，他们本质上都是善良的人。真嗣拥有巨大的同理心和强烈的正义感，尽管他的抑郁几乎让他变得愤世嫉俗，掩盖了他天生的同理心。明日香则将自己的真实和关怀的自我深埋在尖锐的壁垒之后，认为这样可以阻止她成为最好的人。因为如果连她自己的父母都不在乎，别人又凭什么在乎她，除非她是最好的。而成为最好的唯一途径就是变得强大。如果她需要别人的帮助，那就意味着她很弱，没有人会爱弱者，他们会被抛弃，只有最好的人才配得到爱。

Genuine affection and care is something that is given regardless, while empty praise lasts only as long as you are useful to someone. For most of her life Asuka believed the praise she got piloting was genuine affection, validating her own self and her worth. While Shinji also wanted genuine affection he never changed himself or how he lived and instead waited for the world to change instead, becoming apathetic and depressed at the world's lack of change believing it meant no one cared about him enough to change and be kind to him.  
真正的爱和关怀是无条件的，而空洞的赞美只会在你对他有用时持续。在她的生活中，明日香大部分时间都认为她驾驶时得到的赞美是真正的爱，这验证了她的自我价值。而真嗣虽然也渴望真正的爱，但他从未改变自己或自己的生活方式，而是等待世界改变，对世界的不变感到冷漠和沮丧，认为这意味着没有人足够关心他，以至于不愿改变并对他友善。

All that changed after Mt. Asama, when Asuka discovered someone could care about her because she was Asuka and not the Second Child and Shinji discovered his actions could change how others treated him. They both took a chance then, they both met each other halfway and never looked back.  
这一切在浅间山之后发生了改变，当明日香发现有人因为她就是明日香而关心她，而不是因为她是第二适格者；而真嗣发现他的行为可以改变别人对他的态度。那时，他们都抓住了机会，彼此向对方迈出了一步，从此未曾回头。

Long after the sun had set a tired Misato Katsuragi stumbled into the apartment with a weak:  
夜幕早已降临，疲惫不堪的葛城美里踉跄着走进公寓，虚弱地开口：

"I'm home." “我回来了。”

Asuka was the quickest and got to Misato just as the door to the outside world closed behind the purple haired major.  
明日香动作最快，就在紫发少校身后的门关上之际，她赶到了美里身边。

"How'd it go Misato? When can I get my Eva back?" Asuka asked in a voice of not entirely fake desperation. Though piloting was not her entire life anymore she still thoroughly enjoyed it, and besides there was something she needed to find out, something she needed to _**talk**_ about with Shinji later…  
"美里，情况怎么样？我什么时候能拿回我的 Eva？" 明日香用一种并非完全假装出来的迫切语气问道。虽然驾驶 Eva 不再是她生活的全部，但她仍然非常享受，而且，她还有些事情需要弄清楚，有些话需要稍后和真嗣谈谈……

"I don't know. Maybe never." Misato said unable to look the redhead in the eye.  
"我不知道。也许永远不行。" 美里说，无法直视红发女孩的眼睛。

"But why Misato?! You never explained why are we both grounded. Or how did NERV kill the Angel? If they sent us home we obviously don't have mental contamination." Asuka asked exasperatedly trying to get some answers as Misato quietly took off her shoes and made her way toward the kitchen.  
"但为什么，美里？！你从没解释过为什么我们俩都被禁足了。或者 NERV 是怎么消灭使徒的？如果他们让我们回家，那我们显然没有受到精神污染。" 明日香焦急地追问，试图得到一些答案，而美里默默地脱下鞋子，朝厨房走去。

"Both your Evas went berserk and ripped themselves out of the Angel. In doing so they both consumed the Angels S2 organs." Misato said in her quiet no-nonsense voice as she stood in the middle of the kitchen.  
"你的两台 EVA 都暴走了，撕裂了使徒。在这样做的同时，它们都吞噬了使徒的 S2 器官。" 美里用她那平静而严肃的语气说道，站在厨房中央。

"What are those?" Shinji asked genuinely puzzled. As he joined the conversation while he got Misato's dinner out of the oven and onto the kitchen table.  
"那些是什么？" 真嗣真诚地问道，显得有些困惑。他一边加入对话，一边从烤箱中取出美里的晚餐，摆放在厨房桌上。

"The Super Solenoid organ is what gives an angel its power, it's essentially a giant reactor with unlimited power located in the Angel's core. Damn it baka why did you think destroying an Angel's core killed it? Because that was where the S2 organ was!" Asuka said, her finger and nose pointed up as she lectured Shinji on what she thought should be basic information given their line of work.  
"超级螺线管器官是使徒力量的来源，本质上是一个位于使徒核心的巨大反应堆，拥有无限能量。该死，笨蛋，你难道不知道摧毁使徒核心就能杀死它吗？就是因为 S2 器官在那里！" 明日香说道，她的手指和鼻子翘得高高的，像是在给真嗣讲解她认为他们工作中应该掌握的基本知识。

"Sorry, biology was never my strong suit." Shinji said sheepishly. His hand rubbing the back of his head.  
"抱歉，生物学一直不是我的强项。" 真嗣尴尬地说道，手不自觉地挠着后脑勺。

"None of the subjects at school are your strong suit." Asuka remarked snidely.  
"学校的科目里，没有哪一门是你的强项吧。" 明日香尖刻地评论道。

"But then shouldn't that be a good thing? Now that our Evas have unlimited power and don't need their umbilical cords." Shinji asked perplexedly before Misato shook her head and responded:  
"但那样的话，不是应该算好事吗？现在我们的 Eva 拥有无限能量，不再需要脐带了。" 真嗣困惑地问道，随后美里摇了摇头回应：

"Even activating your Evangelions now might cause a world ending event, we're not really sure at all, there's still so much we don't understand about the Angels or the Evas for that matter." Misato remarked in a bitter and tired voice as she finally managed to sit down and get a beer in her hand courtesy of Kaji "So until further notice both Units-01 and 02 are frozen." Misato said as she cracked open her can of Yebisu.  
"即使现在启动你的 EVA，也可能引发世界末日般的事件，我们对使徒和 EVA 的了解还远远不够。" 美里用苦涩而疲惫的声音说道，终于坐下来，从加持那里拿到了一罐啤酒，"所以在进一步通知之前，初号机和零号机都将被冻结。" 美里说着，打开了她的惠比寿啤酒罐。

"But that means Rei is going to be alone." Shinji said worriedly while Misato downed her beer.  
"但这意味着绫波会独自一人。" 真嗣担忧地说，而美里则喝着她的啤酒。

"I brought this up with the committee. Assholes." Misato said as she angrily crushed the now empty can. "They said the Americans were close to finishing Units-03 and 04 and they would soon be operational. Now all we have to do is hope the next Angel politely waits until they are finished and in Japan, before deciding to attack."  
"我和委员会提过这事。那些混蛋。" 美里愤怒地捏扁了空罐子，"他们说美国人已经接近完成三号机和四号机，很快就能投入使用。现在我们只能祈祷下一个使徒能礼貌地等到它们完工并运到日本后再决定攻击。"

**Later**

Central Dogma is in chaos. Alarms are blaring, voices are raised, data is checked, and all while an ominous red dot on the North American continent, expanding and consuming NERV's Second Branch is played over and over on the large monitors.  
中央教条区陷入混乱。警报声此起彼伏，人声嘈杂，数据被反复核查，而北美大陆上那个不祥的红点，不断扩张并吞噬着 NERV 第二支部，这一幕在大屏幕上反复播放。

**The Bowels of NERV NERV 的深处**

"I had wanted to put the dummy plug's data in Units-01 and 02 but now that is no longer possible." Gendo said accepting the fact that putting an untested control mechanism in machines with a history of going berserk that now possessed an unlimited power supply is an unbelievably bad idea. Putting the dummy plug data in Unit-00 instead was redundant on **so** many levels as to not even be worth considering.  
“我本想将傀儡系统的数据植入零号机和二号机，但现在这已不可能。”碇源堂接受了这一事实，意识到将未经测试的控制系统植入那些有着狂暴历史、如今又拥有无限动力的机体中，是一个极其糟糕的主意。将傀儡系统数据转而植入零号机，在多方面都显得多余，以至于根本不值得考虑。

"The system still possesses an incredible amount of errors and needs a large amount of work to be truly effective." Dr Ritsuko Akagi said giving a rundown on the dummy plug's status.  
"系统仍存在大量错误，需要大量工作才能真正有效。"赤木律子博士在介绍 Dummy Plug 的状态时说道。

"Can it be used for Unit-03's initial activation?"  
"它能用于 Unit-03 的初次启动吗？"

"Normally I would say no, that it is still too risky with all the errors but…" Ritsuko thought at the time and resources poured into the dummy plug system. It had to work. The pilots were too unreliable and psychologically damaged. They needed a more consistent way to control the Evas, not just against the Angels, but especially for Gendo's scenario they needed a system that followed orders without question.  
"通常我会说不，考虑到所有错误，风险还是太大，但是……"律子考虑到投入到 Dummy Plug 系统中的时间和资源。它必须成功。驾驶员们太过不可靠且心理受损。他们需要一种更稳定的方式来控制 Eva，不仅是对抗使徒，尤其是在碇源堂的计划中，他们需要一个绝对服从命令的系统。

Only Rei would do that. Rei's lack of character and personality was not simply a means of controlling her but also necessary. Even with the most advanced hardware on the planet they couldn't fully digitize a "normal" person and their full range of memories and foibles. Hence Rei, and her bland existence, memories so unvaried that they blurred together into one mass, and an almost doll-like persona that didn't take up too much space in her mind so that all the things that made up Rei's essence, her soul, could actually fit on the limited memory they possessed in both the dummy plugs and the backup drives in the cloning bay. "…it is the only remaining option that exists to see if what _we_ envision is possible." Ritsuko said emphasizing, again, that she was on board with Gendo's scenario, hoping he would reward her with his affection. Keep the darkness and angst at bay for just a moment longer with his warmth.  
只有丽会这么做。丽的性格和个性的缺失不仅是为了控制她，也是必要的。即使拥有地球上最先进的硬件，他们也无法完全数字化一个“正常”人的全部记忆和瑕疵。因此，有了丽，以及她那平淡无奇的存在，记忆如此单一以至于它们模糊成了一团，还有一个几乎像玩偶一样的人格，不会在她的脑海中占据太多空间，这样构成丽本质的所有东西，她的灵魂，才能真正适应他们拥有的有限内存，无论是模拟插件还是克隆舱中的备份驱动器。“……这是我们能看到的唯一剩下的选择，以验证我们设想的可能性。”律子强调道，再次表明她支持源堂的计划，希望他能用他的关爱奖励她，让黑暗和痛苦暂时退却，哪怕只是一瞬间。

"Make the preparations." Risk is all relative anyways.  
“做好准备。”风险终究是相对的。

"Understood. I still want to recruit a pilot so we can have a baseline to compare the dummy plug's performance to." Since after all if the dummy plug was only a fraction combat effective as a pilot they needed to know. "There is a candidate for whom a core can be readied immediately."  
"明白了。我还是想招募一名飞行员，这样我们就能有一个基准来比较模拟插头的性能。" 毕竟，如果模拟插头的战斗效能只有飞行员的一小部分，他们需要知道。"有一个候选人，可以立即为他准备核心。"

"Very well." "很好。"

**A/N:** This chapter really fought me. I'm not entirely happy with all of it but I want to keep to my self-imposed deadlines or this fic will never be finished. I think it's mostly because I never thought this story would get this far, or be more than a loose collection of lemons, so I didn't outline and think through all the changes and how to portray them in the story. But thanks to you guys and all your positive feedback and support I feel committed to seeing this thing through. This is definitely more plot focused but it's necessary to lay out the direction this fic is going to take. But I promise every chapter should have some lemon in it. So if you want that just skip ahead. As always let me know what you think. More story, more lemon, or both.  
作者注：这一章真的让我很挣扎。我对其中的一部分并不完全满意，但我希望遵守自己设定的截止日期，否则这篇小说永远不会完成。我想这主要是因为我从未想过这个故事会发展到这个地步，或者不仅仅是一些松散的柠檬情节，所以我并没有进行大纲规划和深入思考所有的变化以及如何在故事中展现它们。但感谢你们的积极反馈和支持，我感到有责任将这个故事进行到底。这章确实更加注重情节，但为了明确这篇小说的发展方向，这是必要的。但我保证每章都会有一些柠檬情节。所以如果你想看那些，可以直接跳过。一如既往，请告诉我你的想法。更多故事，更多柠檬，还是两者都要。

### Chapter 6 An Open Door

Asuka Langley Sohryu, Second Child, and pilot of NERVs Evangelion Unit 02, stood under the shower head in the Katsuragi apartment. For the fifth time that day she lathered her strawberry scented shower gel over skin. Her body becoming covered in fragrant pink bubbles until the beads of water swept them away. She took her arm and held it to her nose as she stood under the stream of water from.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷，第二适格者，NERV 的 EVA 二号机驾驶员，站在葛城公寓的淋浴头下。那天她第五次将草莓香味的沐浴露涂抹在皮肤上。她的身体被芬芳的粉色泡沫覆盖，直到水珠将它们冲走。她抬起手臂，凑近鼻子，站在水流下。

"Still smells like blood." She said to herself as her nose picked up the persistent odor.  
“还是闻起来像血。”她自言自语，鼻子捕捉到了那股挥之不去的气味。

Ever since she and Shinji had returned from the shadow of the 12th Angel she had felt the faint smell of blood permeating her skin. Whether that had always been the case due to her heavy and lifelong exposure to LCL and she had only noticed just now or due to her recent experience inside the hazy dreamworld of the Dirac sea she didn't know.  
自从她和真嗣从第 12 使徒的阴影中归来后，她就感觉到皮肤上弥漫着淡淡的血腥味。这究竟是因为她长期大量接触 LCL 而一直如此，只是现在才注意到，还是因为她最近在狄拉克海的朦胧梦境中的经历，她不得而知。

It had also affected her synch rate, and Shinji's as well. They had only been conscious for several days when NERV hauled them in to see how being stuck in an infinite sea of nothingness had affected their ability to pilot. And surprise surprise both their synch rates were down, not catastrophically, but enough. Asuka had regained the top spot, but she was sure everyone could tell her boasts had been hollow. And if that hadn't been bad enough they also had to go back to school THAT SAME DAY! Maybe they thought forcing them back into their daily routine would improve their scores? Either that or NERV is even more moronic than she thought.  
这同样影响了她的同步率，还有真嗣的。他们在被 NERV 带去测试之前，只清醒了几天，看看被困在无尽虚空中对他们的驾驶能力有何影响。不出所料，两人的同步率都下降了，虽然不至于灾难性，但足以引起关注。明日香重新夺回了榜首位置，但她确信每个人都能看出她的自夸空洞无物。更糟糕的是，他们当天还得回学校！也许他们认为强迫他们回归日常能提高成绩？要么就是 NERV 比她想的还要愚蠢。

One small consolation in all this had been that after she had picked them up from school Misato had rushed off, only walking them to the door of the apartment before sheepishly saying:  
在这所有的不幸中，唯一的小安慰是，从学校接他们回家后，美里匆匆离开，只把他们送到公寓门口，然后尴尬地说：

"_Alright kids I've got to go! Lots of work and meetings so I'll be back late!" She finished as the door hissed shut. Later Shinji noticed a red blinking light on the answering machine and hit the playback button which made Misato a liar._  
“好了，孩子们，我得走了！有很多工作和会议，所以我会回来得很晚！”她话音刚落，门就嘶嘶地关上了。后来，真嗣注意到答录机上闪烁的红灯，按下回放键，揭穿了美里的谎言。

"_Hey Katsuragi!" Kaji's charming voice began. "I got your message. Come on by my place, we should talk."_  
"嘿，桂木！" 加持那迷人的声音响起，"我收到你的消息了。来我这儿一趟，我们得谈谈。"

"_She just got us back and she's already off to her lover!" Asuka said indignantly as the message ended._  
"她刚把我们找回来，就急着去找她的情人了！" 明日香愤愤不平地说道，消息也随之结束。"

"_Are you complaining?" Shinji asked, his eyebrow raised._  
"你在抱怨吗？" 真嗣问道，眉头微挑。"

"_No." Asuka had said closing the distance between them, inserting her hands under his shirt to run her hands over his bare chest and back as they embraced each other tightly._  
"不。" 明日香说着，拉近了彼此的距离，双手探入他的衬衫下，抚摸着他赤裸的胸膛和背部，两人紧紧相拥。

"_Go take a shower. I'll get dinner started." Shinji said after some time of happy silence._  
"去洗个澡吧。我来准备晚饭。" 真嗣在一段愉快的沉默后说道。

"_Oh are you saying I smell Third!" Asuka pounced on her lover's poor choice of words._  
"哦，你是说我身上有味道吗，第三适格者！" 明日香抓住了恋人话语中的漏洞，扑了上去。

"_No, just…isn't that what you usually do?" Shinji said squirming a little but otherwise holding his own._  
“不，只是……这不是你通常会做的事吗？” 真嗣有些局促地说，但总体上还是保持镇定。

_Asuka hadn't really answered Shinji merely kissed him tenderly on the lips as she extracted her hands from under his shirt and giving her ass a little extra shake as she walked toward the shower to give the baka something to think about.  
明日香并没有真正回答真嗣，只是温柔地吻了他的唇，同时从他的衬衫下抽出手，走向淋浴间时还特意扭了扭臀部，给这个笨蛋留下点思考的空间。_

Which brought her to where she is now, standing under the shower head letting her thoughts turn toward introspection.  
这让她来到了现在的位置，站在淋浴头下，任由思绪转向内省。

Who was Misato to her?  
Misato 对她来说是谁？

A big sister? An Aunt? A friend? A guardian? A mother?  
一个姐姐？一个阿姨？一个朋友？一个监护人？一个母亲？

That last one made Asuka shiver despite the steam that surrounded her in the shower.  
最后一个选项让 Asuka 在淋浴的蒸汽中也不禁打了个寒颤。

She had known the beer-loving purple-head back in Germany. They'd been reasonably friendly to each other, though she hadn't known she was Kaji's ex at the time. And since she had come to Tokyo-3, especially in the beginning, she had grated under the favoritism she had shown Shinji.  
她曾在德国认识那位爱喝啤酒的紫发女孩。她们当时相处得还算友好，尽管她那时并不知道对方是加持的前女友。而自从她来到第三新东京市，尤其是在初期，她对真嗣的偏爱让她感到十分不快。

Misato knew about her past, about her mother, and her resulting constant need for attention and validation and somehow thought doting on her other ward would be healthy for Asuka's psychology. Maybe it was her trying to help in her own way. Maybe she had favored Shinji because she had believed Asuka's outward act of self-confidence to be evidence she had overcome her past ordeals. Either way Asuka concluded Misato should never ever be a psychologist.  
美里了解她的过去，知道她的母亲，以及她因此而不断寻求关注和认可的心理需求，并认为对她另一个养子过分宠爱会对明日香的心理健康有益。或许这是她以自己的方式试图帮助明日香。也许她偏爱真嗣是因为她相信明日香表现出的自信是她已经克服过去苦难的证据。无论如何，明日香认为美里绝不应该成为一名心理学家。

But Asuka was grateful to Misato. She had given her a home, a pseudo-family, and, if even unknowingly, her lover.  
但明日香对美里心存感激。她给了她一个家，一个伪家庭，甚至在她不知情的情况下，她的爱人。

Speaking of lovers… 说到恋人……

She wasn't sure about Kaji's past, she had been too enamored with the idea ofhim to actually _know_ him, and whether it was filled with trauma like Misato's. But given the fact he lived through Second Impact…well very few people **didn't** lose someone.  
她对加持的过去并不确定，她曾过于迷恋他的形象，以至于并未真正了解他，也不清楚他的过去是否像美里那样充满创伤。但考虑到他经历了第二次冲击……很少有人没有失去过亲人。

So it made sense that she was seeking his comfort. After all isn't that what she and Shinji were doing? Finding solace and affection in each other.  
所以她寻求他的安慰是合情合理的。毕竟，她和真嗣不也是在彼此身上寻找慰藉和关爱吗？

"Is that all this world is? Broken people stumbling through the dark looking for a bit of light, a bit of warmth?"  
"难道这个世界就只是这样吗？破碎的人们在黑暗中跌跌撞撞，寻找一丝光明，一丝温暖？"

"_Scheisse!"_ The sudden twinge of cold impacting on her skin coming from the shower head told her that that was enough brooding for now and Asuka quickly shut the water off and found a towel.  
"该死！" 淋浴头突然喷出的冷水打在她的皮肤上，告诉她现在 brooding 够了，明日香迅速关掉水，找到一条毛巾。

Wrapping her red towel around her body after she had mostly dried herself off she went out into the kitchen where she heard the tell-tale sizzle of something being fried in a pan and the heavenly smell it was filling the apartment with, instantly bringing Asuka out of her earlier ruminations.  
她用一条红色的毛巾裹住身体，大致擦干后，走进厨房，那里传来了平底锅里煎炸的声音和弥漫整个公寓的诱人香气，立刻让明日香从之前的沉思中回过神来。

"Smells good lover." Asuka said draping her still damp body across Shinji's back in a much more relaxed and natural way than she ever did with Kaji.  
“闻起来真香，爱人。”明日香说着，将她那依然湿润的身体随意地搭在真嗣背上，这种放松自然的姿态，比起她与加持在一起时，显得更加自在。

"Thanks." Shinji said not nearly as distracted or speechless as he would have been in the same situation just a few months ago in what surely would make any observer seriously consider if they were in fact a married couple with how calm and comfortable they were in each other's presence.  
“谢谢。”真嗣回答道，他并未像几个月前那样心神不宁或无言以对，这种平静与自在，足以让任何旁观者确信他们确实是一对已婚夫妇，彼此间相处得如此和谐舒适。

"Teriyaki?" Asuka asked as her mind found the word that matched the smell her nostrils were sending her brain.  
“是照烧吗？”明日香问道，她的脑海中浮现出与鼻尖所嗅到的香气相符的那个词。

"Yellowtail teriyaki with steamed rice and vegetables along with miso soup." Shinji said giving a rundown of their evening's menu.  
“照烧黄尾鱼配蒸米饭和蔬菜，还有味噌汤。”真嗣说着，概述了他们今晚的菜单。

"I'd never knew fish could be so good before coming here." Asuka remarked as her hands made small circles on Shinji's back as she watched him work. She'd never known how good a lot of things could be before she met Shinji. The pleasant smile on Asuka's face soon turned to a frown as she remembered, despite her best efforts, her earlier musings and the thing she wanted to ask Shinji about the next time they were alone. Well no time like the present.  
“来这里之前，我从不知道鱼可以这么好吃。”明日香评论道，她的手在真嗣的背上轻轻画着小圈，看着他忙碌。在遇到真嗣之前，她从未意识到许多事情可以如此美好。明日香脸上愉快的微笑很快变成了皱眉，她想起了尽管自己尽力不去想，但早些时候的思绪和她想在下一次独处时问真嗣的事情。嗯，没有比现在更好的时机了。

"Did she say anything? When you were in there?" She felt Shinji tense at the words but he quickly recovered and without taking his eyes of his cooking answered:  
“她说了什么吗？你们在里面的时候？”明日香感觉到真嗣在听到这些话时紧张了一下，但他很快恢复过来，没有把目光从烹饪上移开，回答道：

"No, I didn't really feel anything different during the synch test today, though I wasn't really looking for her." He paused before continuing. "When we were inside the angel and she came, she never said anything, it was just a presence but one I _**knew**_ was mother."  
"不，今天同步测试时我并没有感觉到什么不同，虽然我也没有特意去寻找她。" 他停顿了一下，继续说道。"当我们进入使徒内部，她出现时，她什么也没说，只是一种存在感，但我能感觉到那是母亲。"

"Same here. I knew it was Mama, but I don't think we should go looking for her in the Evas now when we don't have any information to go on, especially since it might be our mothers causing the berserk states and contacting them might be the trigger for that." Asuka said trying to use her genius brain to analyze all the data they had.  
"我也是。我知道那是妈妈，但我认为我们现在不应该在没有线索的情况下在 EVA 中寻找她，尤其是考虑到可能是我们的母亲导致了暴走状态，联系她们可能是触发这一状态的诱因。" 明日香试图运用她的天才大脑来分析他们所掌握的所有数据。"

"But why is she there in the first place?" Shinji asked puzzled as he flipped over the fish in the pan. Then the coin dropped.  
"但为什么她会出现在那里呢？" 真嗣困惑地问，同时翻动着平底锅里的鱼。随后，他恍然大悟。"

"Wait. Both our mothers worked for NERV."  
"等等。我们俩的母亲都在 NERV 工作。"

"And both had accidents about the same time."  
"而且她们差不多同一时间遭遇了事故。"

"And we both were chosen as pilots."  
"我们俩都被选为驾驶员。"

"And we both can feel our mothers inside the Evas."  
"我们都能感受到我们的母亲在 Eva 里面。"

"There's got to be a connection there." Asuka said bringing her hands up to her head and trying to make sense of all this. "And why was the Angel so concerned with our relationship?"  
"那里肯定有联系。" 明日香双手抱头，试图理清这一切。"还有，为什么那个使徒如此关注我们的关系？"

"You're sure it was the Angel?"  
"你确定那是使徒吗？"

"Who else would it have been baka!" Asuka said briefly losing her temper as Shinji placed the ready fish on plates and got the serving bowls for the rice and miso.  
"除了你这个笨蛋还会有谁！" 明日香简短地发泄了一下情绪，而真嗣则将准备好的鱼放在盘子上，并拿来了盛米饭和味噌汤的碗。

"Maybe they want to understand people, '_Know yourself and your enemy_' or something like that" Shinji said paraphrasing _The Art of War_.  
"也许他们想了解人类，‘知己知彼’之类的吧" 真嗣引用《孙子兵法》中的话解释道。

"Maybe" Asuka said sullenly and looking down at her toes passed her crossed arms. The growling of her stomach told her to stop thinking and eat.  
"也许吧" 明日香闷闷不乐地说道，低头看着自己交叉的双臂间的脚趾。她肚子的咕噜声提醒她别再想了，赶紧吃饭。

So she sat down, still in her towel and dug in to the dinner that Shinji had made, while Pen Pen emerged from his freezer, grabbed a beer from the fridge and ate the sardines Shinji had thoughtfully laid out for him. But he smelt there was more fish to be had and went up next to the table and let out a "Wark!" Asuka who had been about to take another bite of the fish was not having any of the warm-water penguin's whining and turned to face the bird.  
于是她坐了下来，依旧裹着浴巾，开始享用真嗣准备的晚餐，而企鹅潘潘也从冰箱里钻了出来，从冰箱里抓了一瓶啤酒，吃着真嗣细心为他准备好的沙丁鱼。但他闻到了更多鱼的味道，便走到桌边，发出一声“哇克！”原本正要再吃一口鱼的明日香，对这只温带企鹅的抱怨毫无耐心，转头面对着这只鸟。

"What do you want, you already had yours!" Though as she was berating the penguin the slippery teriyaki sauce caused the fish to fall from her chopsticks, and hit her towel before finally landing on the floor where a lucky penguin grabbed it in his beak and quickly retreated back to his freezer with his prize. "You damn bird!" Asuka said as she looked at the splotch of sauce staining her favorite towel.  
“你想要什么，你已经吃过了！”尽管她在训斥企鹅时，滑溜的照烧酱让鱼从她的筷子间滑落，先是打在她的浴巾上，最后掉在地上，幸运的企鹅用嘴叼起它，迅速带着战利品退回到冰箱里。“你这该死的鸟！”明日香看着她最喜欢的浴巾上沾着的酱渍说道。

"Damn it." Asuka said as she pushed her chair back and took off her towel.  
“该死。”明日香说着，推开椅子，脱下了浴巾。

"Give it to me. You finish eating and I'll rinse it." Shinji said as he got up from the table and his empty plate.  
“给我吧。你吃完，我来洗。” 真嗣说着从桌边起身，拿起空盘子。

She handed the towel off and watched him go, her eyes glued to his backside, flat and clothed though it was.  
她递过毛巾，目送他离开，目光紧盯着他的背影，尽管那背影平坦且被衣物遮盖。

Asuka ate absently as her mind raced and hormones flooded her bloodstream. She crossed her legs consciously, worried that dampness emanating from the building arousal would wet the chair she sat on. 'What the hell is with the teenage hormones? Am I really just an animal going through a checklist? Evolutionary it makes sense for a full belly to initiate a sex drive but still did it have to be so overwhelming?'  
明日香心不在焉地吃着，思绪飞速运转，荷尔蒙在血液中汹涌。她下意识地交叉双腿，担心因内心的兴奋而产生的湿润会弄湿她坐的椅子。‘青春期的荷尔蒙到底是怎么回事？我真的只是按照清单行事的动物吗？从进化角度看，吃饱后激发性欲是有道理的，但真的有必要这么强烈吗？’

After some time Shinji came back into the kitchen.  
过了一会儿，真嗣回到了厨房。

"_Köstlich_, Shinji." Asuka said as she patted her belly at the table as she saw him. "But I'm still hungry." She continued as she got up from the table and went towards her roommate having decided it's easier to go with the flow of the neurons in her brain telling herself that it was because she wanted to do it before Misato might come back.  
“真好吃，真嗣。”明日香一边拍着肚子一边在桌旁看着他说道，“但我还是饿。”她继续说着，从桌旁起身走向她的室友，决定顺从大脑中神经元的冲动，告诉自己这样做是因为不想在美里回来之前错过机会。

"Well there's some more rice and vegeta-…" He began before he saw the look on her grinning face "Oh" he said as the realization hit him.  
“嗯，还有些米饭和蔬菜……”他开始说道，但看到她咧嘴笑的表情时停了下来，“哦”他意识到。

"I want something meatier." Asuka answered with an innuendo. "You wouldn't happen to have something else tucked away would you?" Asuka asked in her sultry voice.  
“我想要点更带劲的。”明日香带着双关意味回答，“你该不会还藏着别的什么吧？”她用撩人的嗓音问道。

'Why does she always have to be this teasing? Why?' Shinji thought as he felt her hands through the fabric of his school trousers and boxers.  
“她为什么总是这么爱挑逗？为什么？”真嗣想着，感觉到她的手透过他的校裤和内裤布料。

Shinji looked at the devilish grin that was the only thing Asuka was wearing, she didn't even have her neural adapters. Her hair was in that nebulous region between being dry and wet, where it was soft but not airy, and damp but not soaked, flowing around her shoulders onto her chest and bust. He noticed her nipples were fully erect in all their glory. Whether that was due to Asuka being horny or the chill of the apartment he did not know. Though given where her hand was he could make an educated guess.  
真嗣看着那魔鬼般的笑容，那是明日香身上唯一的装扮，她甚至连神经接续器都没戴。她的头发处于半干半湿的朦胧状态，柔软而不蓬松，微湿而不滴水，披散在肩上，垂落在胸前。他注意到她的乳头完全挺立，尽显其美。不知这是由于明日香的情欲还是公寓的寒意，他不得而知。不过考虑到她的手所在的位置，他可以做出一个合理的猜测。

She pressed her nude body against him, wrapping her arms around him as she nibbled at his earlobe and whispered into his ear:  
她将赤裸的身体紧贴着他，双臂环绕着他，轻咬他的耳垂并在他耳边低语：

"Sorry." The sensation gave him goosebumps across his body. Only too late did his brain process Asuka's solitary word and what it might mean.  
"对不起。"这感觉让他全身起了鸡皮疙瘩。直到太晚，他的大脑才处理了明日香那唯一的一个词以及它可能意味着什么。

'Wait why is she so-' Shinji began thinking before he got his answer. She swiped his legs out from under him, but cradled his body in her arms so he didn't fall onto the linoleum, just a gentle thud as Shinji's body hit the floor as Asuka straddled him.  
'等等，她为什么这么——' 真嗣开始思考，但很快得到了答案。她扫腿将他绊倒，却用双臂稳稳接住了他的身体，使他没有摔在油毡地板上，只是随着真嗣的身体轻轻落地，明日香跨坐在了他身上。

"But I can't really wait." Asuka said as she grabbed his shirt collar with both hands and in one motion ripped open his school shirt. Buttons went flying across the kitchen, he could hear the distinct impact of one of them hitting something made of glass but he couldn't tell exactly where it was.  
“但我真的等不及了。”明日香说着，双手抓住他的衬衫领口，猛地一扯，校服衬衫应声而开，纽扣四散飞溅，厨房里回荡着纽扣撞击玻璃的清脆声响，但他无法确定具体位置。

'Really the kitchen floor?' Shinji thought as Asuka furiously undid the belt to his pants, he lifted up his ass to help her as she pulled his pants and boxers off in one motion. They'd done it basically everywhere else in the apartment except for the balcony and Misato's room for obvious reasons.  
“真的要在厨房地板上吗？”真嗣心想，明日香正急切地解开他裤子的腰带，他抬起臀部配合她，她一气呵成地将他的裤子和内裤一并脱下。他们几乎在公寓的每个角落都尝试过，除了阳台和美里房间，原因显而易见。

Asuka grabbed at Shinji's semi-hard member, it wasn't flaccid but neither was it ready for her waiting pussy. So she took it in her mouth. She tasted the salty skin from leftover sweat as her mouth worked up and down his shaft and his musky odor filled her nostrils. Usually they both showered before sex but right now Asuka was far too horny for that.  
明日香抓住真嗣半勃起的阴茎，它既非完全疲软，也未准备好迎接她等待已久的私处。于是她将其含入口中，品尝着残留汗水的咸涩肌肤，她的嘴上下移动着他的阴茎，他的麝香气味充斥着她的鼻腔。通常他们在做爱前都会洗澡，但此刻明日香欲火中烧，顾不得这些。

She feverishly bobbed her head up and down, going so quickly she even began to gag a bit as the member in her mouth quickly became rock hard.  
她狂热地上下点头，速度之快以至于开始有些干呕，嘴里的那物迅速变得坚硬如石。

Once Asuka thought his cock was ready she sat up and lifted her hips up above Shinji's groin taking his cock in one hand and guiding it to her waiting entrance. She brushed the head between her labia, her wetness mixing with the saliva as she positioned the cock and slowly lowered herself onto it. She felt his balls brush against the curve of her ass-cheeks as his shaft was fully hilted into her. She paused for a moment savoring the feeling of fullness, she brought her face down to his and they shared a kiss that conveyed so much, passion lust, love, understanding, acceptance. Their entire relationship and being conveyed in a simple action. The kiss ended and the tiny pop of their lips separating filled the silence of the apartment.  
当明日香认为他的阴茎已经准备好了，她坐起身，将臀部抬高至真嗣的腹部上方，一手握住他的阴茎，引导它对准自己等待的入口。她用阴茎头轻触阴唇，湿润与唾液交融，她调整好位置，缓缓坐下，感受他的阴囊轻触她臀部的曲线，他的阴茎完全插入她体内。她停顿片刻，品味着这种充实感，俯身与他相吻，这个吻传递了太多情感——激情、欲望、爱意、理解、接纳。他们整个关系和存在都浓缩在这个简单的动作中。吻毕，他们嘴唇分开时那微小的“啵”声，填满了公寓的寂静。

Asuka put her hands on Shinji's chest to brace herself as she shifted around her legs so her feet were flat on the ground and she was more squatting on rather than straddling Shinji's crotch. Slowly she began pumping her body up and down on his rock hard erection, the muscles in her lithe legs bulging and compressing as she sped up her movements and her hips smacked against his. Her lower lips spreading glossy juices all over his cock as her insides tightened at the stimulation they were receiving while her mouth let out groans at the exertion and Shinji's eyes were glued to the look on her face. Lips spread open and panting, eyes struggling to stay open as the effort and pleasure nearly overwhelmed them.  
明日香将双手放在真嗣的胸前，稳住自己，同时调整双腿的位置，使双脚平放在地面上，她更像是蹲坐在真嗣的胯部而非跨坐在上。她缓缓开始在真嗣坚硬如石的勃起上上下抽动身体，她纤细双腿的肌肉随着动作的加快而膨胀收缩，臀部拍击着他的。她的下唇分泌出光泽的液体，涂满了他的阴茎，而她的体内因受到刺激而紧缩，口中发出因用力与快感交织的呻吟，真嗣的目光紧紧锁定在她脸上的表情。双唇微张，喘息连连，双眼挣扎着不愿闭合，努力与快感几乎将她淹没。

After several more thrusts Asuka brought her legs down so her knees were again on the kitchen floor and she slowed down her movements. Shinji lifted his hands up to Asuka's thighs to guide her movements. He didn't want to remain passive and he used this pause in their love-making to try and get some say in what came next.  
又进行了几次冲刺后，明日香放下双腿，膝盖重新触碰厨房地板，并减缓了动作。真嗣抬起双手放在明日香的大腿上，引导她的动作。他不想只是被动接受，利用这次爱抚的间歇，试图在接下来的事情中争取一些主动权。

"Oh no you don't." Asuka said forcefully as she grabbed Shinji's hands and pinned them to the floor with hers. "Not this time." Asuka wanted to be in full control. Not just because she derived more pleasure when she was on top and could direct where, when, and how hard Shinji's shaft could strike at her insides. Well that wasn't the only reason. It was also her pride. She knew that Shinji could make himself cum when he thrust his member into her, but she wanted to prove to herself that she could make him cum just by riding him. So in pursuit of that goal she renewed the gyrating motion of her hips, grinding their pelvises together even more.  
“休想得逞。”明日香强硬地说着，抓住真嗣的双手，用自己的手将它们按在地板上。“这次不行。”明日香想要完全掌控局面。不仅仅是因为她更喜欢在上面，能够主导真嗣的冲击力度和节奏，带来更多快感。当然，这并非唯一原因。这也是她的骄傲。她知道真嗣可以在插入她时自行射精，但她想证明自己仅凭骑乘就能让他达到高潮。为了实现这一目标，她重新开始了臀部的扭动，更加用力地磨蹭两人的骨盆。

Asuka then moved her ass up and down quickly, each time she went down half or two-thirds of his length, taking a pause every now and then to slowly take in his whole shaft and hilt down to his ever-tightening balls. Not much longer now. She bit her lip as her walls tightened around Shinji's member and the slapping of their hips together echoed in the kitchen. A little moan managed to escape her mouth and she saw Shinji's glazed eyes looking up at her chest as her breast bounced in tandem with her riding motions.  
接着，明日香快速上下移动臀部，每次下压都深入到他的一半或三分之二，时不时停顿一下，缓缓吞入他的整根阴茎直至紧绷的睾丸。应该快了。她咬着嘴唇，阴道壁紧紧包裹着真嗣的阴茎，两人臀部相撞的声音在厨房回荡。她忍不住发出一声轻吟，看到真嗣迷离的眼神正盯着她随着动作跳动的胸部。

Soon enough her efforts were rewarded as she felt Shinji's cock jolt inside of her before a spreading warmness filled her. 'I did it.' Asuka thought in satisfaction as her body shook as she crossed the crest of her own orgasm.  
不久，她的努力得到了回报，她感觉到真嗣的阴茎在她体内猛地一震，随后一股温暖的扩散感填满了她。'我做到了。' 明日香满意地想着，她的身体因达到高潮的巅峰而颤抖。

She finally let Shinji's hands go and he brought his arms up around her back and brought her down, so that her heaving chest was lying on top of him and their heads were next to each other. After a few small thrusts to help Asuka come down from her high Shinji removed his cock from her. It was sticky, covered in a mix of their love juices and his cock had been so deep that barely a trickle of the cum he had shot into her poured out.  
她终于松开了真嗣的手，他则将双臂环绕到她的背后，将她拉下，使得她起伏的胸部紧贴在他身上，两人的头靠在一起。经过几次小幅度的抽插帮助明日香从高潮中平复下来后，真嗣从她体内抽出了阴茎。它黏糊糊的，沾满了他们爱的体液，他的阴茎深入到几乎只有一丝他射入她体内的精液缓缓流出。

"Did you get the pills from Hikari?" Shinji asked as his brain began to function again. Asuka had restarted her regimen but had been near the end of 'her' prescription just before the last angel attack and had been meaning to get the next batch.  
你从光那里拿到药了吗？" 真嗣的思维开始重新运转。明日香已经重新开始她的疗程，但在上次使徒袭击前，她几乎用完了自己的处方药，一直打算去取下一批。

"Yeah, that was probably the only good thing that came out of NERV making us go to school today." Asuka remarked bitterly.  
“是啊，那大概是 NERV 今天逼我们去学校唯一的好处了。”明日香苦涩地评论道。

"We got to see our friends." Shinji said.  
“我们见到了朋友们。”真嗣说道。

"You mean our friends got to tease us and bombard us with questions…again." Asuka said as she remembered the unbridled stupidity she had had to deal with today.  
“你是说我们的朋友们再次有机会取笑我们，用问题轰炸我们……”明日香回想起今天不得不面对的无尽愚蠢。

"I'm surprised no one is beginning to suspect something" Shinji said as he remembered classmates asking how the honeymoon was.  
"我真惊讶没人开始怀疑什么。" 真嗣说道，回想起同学们询问蜜月如何的情景。

"Even if they suspect something they can't possibly know the details, otherwise we'd not have been able to do what we just did."Asuka said her reasoning sound, before she changed the subject to something else she had noticed today "Did you see how Hikari looked at your jock-stooge?"  
"即使他们怀疑，也不可能知道细节，否则我们刚才做的事就无法进行。" 明日香逻辑清晰地说道，随即换了个话题，提到她今天注意到的事情，"你看到光子看你那体育健将跟班的眼神了吗？"

"You think she likes him?"  
"你觉得她喜欢他吗？"

"Oh I know it." "哦，我知道的。"

"Girl stuff?" Shinji asked with a raised eyebrow. He really didn't understand the inner workings of women's mind.  
"女孩子的话题？" 真嗣挑眉问道。他真的不太懂女生的心思。

"Yeah…she keeps asking about our relationship when the two of us are alone and secluded. What it's like, what we do, how **it** feels." Asuka said as she remembered how red Hikari's face was when asking that last question. "We should get them to talk before she pins him down in a supply closet." Asuka finished with a giggle.  
"是啊……她总是趁我们俩独处时问起我们的关系，是什么样的，我们做些什么，感觉如何。" 明日香回忆起光子问最后一个问题时脸红的样子，"我们得让他们聊聊，免得她把他堵在储物间里。" 明日香笑着总结道。

"You think she'd do that?" Shinji asked with genuine doubt.  
"你觉得她会那样做吗？" 真嗣带着真正的怀疑问道。

"It's always the quiet ones that snap the hardest."  
"往往是最安静的人爆发得最厉害。"

**The Next Morning: Kaji's Place  
次日早晨：加持的住处**

Misato woke to streams of sunlight coming through the half closed blinds of a bedroom she had never spent a night in before. Her eyes slowly focused in on a face gazing at her own with a light smile.  
美里醒来时，阳光透过半掩的百叶窗洒进了一个她从未在此过夜的卧室。她的眼睛缓缓聚焦，看到一张脸正带着浅笑凝视着她。

"First time in eight years I get to wake up and see your face." Her lover said with his standard charm.  
“八年来第一次，我醒来能看到你的脸。”她的恋人带着一贯的魅力说道。

Misato reached out her hand from under the blanket and caressed the unshaven face of Ryoji Kaji with her soft hand. His beard prickly to her fingers but not unpleasant.  
美里从被子下伸出一只手，用柔软的手掌轻抚着加持良治那未刮胡须的脸庞。他的胡须刺刺的，触感却并不讨厌。

The previous night had been…cathartic. Especially after the recent news that the 2nd Branch had just vanished which was just the cherry on top of all the shit these last few weeks. They had been tough for Misato, between her emotional breakdown after the wedding, her drunken confession to Kaji, uncovering a white crucified monster in Terminal Dogma shattering her trust in NERV, having both her wards be swallowed by an angel…wait…  
前一晚真是……宣泄情感的夜晚。尤其是最近得知第 2 支部刚刚消失的消息，简直是这几周所有糟心事的顶点。对于美里来说，这段时间异常艰难，从婚礼后的情绪崩溃，到向加持醉酒吐真言，再到在终端教条中发现一具被钉在十字架上的白色怪物，彻底粉碎了她对 NERV 的信任，还有她的两个被使徒吞噬的养子……等等……

"THE KIDS!" Misato said remembering that she was supposed to be a responsible guardian as she bolted up from the bed and let the covers fall off exposing her bare chest.  
“孩子们！”美里惊呼，记起自己应该是个负责任的监护人，猛地从床上坐起，被子滑落，露出赤裸的胸膛。

"Calm down Katsuragi" Kaji said as grabbed Misato in a tight embrace "I'm sure they're alright."  
“冷静点，葛城”加持说着，紧紧抱住美里，“我相信他们没事。”

"Yeah" Misato said after calming down and placing her head on Kaji's shoulder before continuing "…and besides it's not like they're ever really unsupervised."  
"嗯"，美里在平静下来后，将头靠在加持的肩膀上，接着说，"……而且，他们也并非真的无人看管。"

Now despite what Shinji and Asuka both thought Section 2 WERE really good at their jobs, it's just that the pilots were wrong about Section 2's objective. The cordon of agents that surrounded them at a distance wasn't faced inward but **outward**. Especially since Shinji running away became an anachronism Section 2 has put much less focus on monitoring the movements and actions of the pilots. Simply knowing what building they are in is enough in case they need to quickly gather them for an Angel attack. The goal is more to establish a perimeter around the pilots and control what comes within that perimeter. Just this month they had stopped two would-be assassins, one lone-wolf out for everlasting infamy and the other a crazed nut from some apocalyptic cult that felt the Eva pilots were halting mankind's well-deserved demise. To say nothing of the never-ending stream of paparazzi out to get photos of humanity's saviors. Hell Section 2 didn't even know Shinji had even bought condoms because they had been tracking a group of three tattooed men approaching the security perimeter.  
尽管真嗣和明日香都认为第二课的工作并不出色，但实际上他们非常擅长自己的职责，只是两位驾驶员对第二课的目标理解有误。那些在远处包围他们的特工们，他们的视线并非向内而是向外。特别是自从真嗣逃跑的行为已成为过去，第二课对监控驾驶员的行动和动向投入了更少的关注。只要知道他们在哪栋建筑里，以便在需要时迅速集结他们应对使徒攻击就足够了。主要目标是围绕驾驶员建立一个警戒圈，并控制进入该圈内的一切。就在这个月，他们阻止了两名潜在的刺客，一个是孤狼，渴望永久的恶名，另一个则是来自某个末日邪教的疯狂信徒，认为 EVA 驾驶员阻碍了人类应得的灭亡。更不用说那些源源不断想要拍摄人类救星照片的狗仔队了。甚至第二课都不知道真嗣买了避孕套，因为他们当时正在追踪一群接近安全警戒圈的三名纹身男子。

"Get dressed, I want to show you something." Kaji said after gently kissing her forehead.  
“穿上衣服，我想给你看样东西。”加持温柔地吻了吻她的额头后说道。

They quickly got ready and into Misato's Alpine for a quick drive to Kaji's little patch of heaven in the Geofront.  
他们迅速准备妥当，坐进了美里那辆阿尔派，疾驰前往加持在地表下的小小天堂。

"Melons? Really?" Misato asked surprised as she got out of the car and walked towards the garden plot with Kaji.  
“种瓜？真的假的？”美里惊讶地下了车，走向加持的园地。

"Everyone needs a hobby. And besides there's something beautiful about helping something grow that reminds me of you." Kaji said as he got his watering can for his melons.  
“每个人都有自己的爱好。而且，看着它们成长，总让我想起你，有种别样的美。”加持说着，拿起浇水壶走向他的瓜田。

"Jackass." Misato said with snorting laughter as she got Kaji's innuendo.  
“蠢货。”美里嗤笑着回应了加持的暗示。

"I want to bring Shinji here sometime, maybe Asuka too." Kaji said as Misato came up next to him and rested her head on his shoulders.  
“我想找个时间带真嗣来这里，也许还有明日香。”加持说道，美里走到他身边，将头靠在他的肩膀上。

"Yeah, I think it might help." She said softly as her eyes watched the drops of water fall from the spout of the watering can and onto leaves, rinds and pool into puddles on the ground.  
“嗯，我觉得可能会有帮助。”她轻声说道，目光随着水壶喷口滴落的水珠，落在叶片上，汇聚成地上的小水洼。

"They like each other don't they?" Kaji remarked as his watering can ran empty and he held the empty container at his side, just enjoying the moment with Katsuragi.  
"他们互相喜欢，不是吗？" 加持说着，手中的喷壶已空，他将空容器放在身侧，只是享受着与葛城在一起的时光。

"I keep noticing the furtive glances they give each other when the other isn't looking and they think I won't notice. They keep fighting and arguing but I can tell their hearts aren't in it" Misato said thinking that was the limit of their relationship.  
"我总是注意到他们在对方不注意时偷偷投去的目光，以为我不会察觉。他们不断争吵，但我能感觉到他们并非真心。" 美里想着，这大概是他们关系的极限了。

"They'd be good for each other."  
"他们彼此很般配。"

"After all the shit they've been through, not just fighting the Angels for us, the least they deserve is happiness. Especially since their piloting days may very well be over." Misato said ruefully. NERV had benched the children but was keeping them around just in case there were no other options.  
"毕竟他们经历了那么多，不仅仅是为了我们与使徒战斗，他们最起码应该得到幸福。尤其是考虑到他们的驾驶生涯很可能已经结束。" 美里苦涩地说道。NERV 虽然让孩子们暂时休息，但仍将他们留在身边，以防万一没有其他选择。

"Asuka's taken that better than I would have thought." Kaji commented genuinely surprised at how the redhead was coping with her entire life being turned upside down.  
"阿斯卡的表现比我预想的要好得多。" 加持真心惊讶于红发少女如何应对她整个生活被彻底颠覆的情况。

"She might still be in denial, that or maybe our messed up little family is helping her cope." Misato looked down sullenly after she finished that sentence as she thought of how she had chosen her lover over her wards the night before.  
"她可能还在否认现实，或者也许是我们这个乱七八糟的小家庭在帮助她应对。" 美里说完这句话后沮丧地低下头，回想起前一晚她选择了爱人而放弃了她的孩子们。

"You heard about Unit-04?" Kaji said trying to change the subject from Misato's own dark introspections as to how fit of a guardian she was.  
"你听说 04 号机的事了吗？" 加持试图转移话题，不让话题继续围绕美里对自己作为监护人是否称职的阴暗反思。

"Yeah, the Americans are terrified and rushing Unit-03 over as fast as they can." Misato remarked bitterly remembering her earlier conversation with Ritsuko about this.  
"是啊，美国人吓坏了，正拼命把 03 号机运过来。" 美里苦涩地回忆起之前与律子关于此事的对话。

"Can you blame them? If the same thing happens at 1st Branch they might lose most of the remaining East Coast." Kaji said injecting a bit of logic and context into the decision.  
"你能怪他们吗？如果同样的事情发生在第一支部，他们可能会失去东海岸的大部分。" 加持加入了一些逻辑和背景来解释这个决定。

"Still seems like they dumping their problems on us." Misato said wrapping her arms fully around Kaji "We haven't even found a pilot yet." Kaji tensed at the words. He leaned close and in a very serious tone very few people knew he was capable of revealed what he had discovered to his renewed flame:  
"还是感觉他们在把问题甩给我们。" 美里说着，双臂紧紧环抱住加持，"我们连个驾驶员都还没找到呢。" 加持听到这话，身体一紧。他靠近了些，用极少数人知道他能用的严肃语气，向他的重燃旧情之人透露了他所发现的秘密：

"The Marduk Institute is just a front. It's NERV pulling all the strings." Misato was shocked at the words but smartly didn't outwardly show it before Kaji continued. "Look at code 2-A."  
"马杜克研究所只是个幌子。一切都是 NERV 在幕后操纵。" 美里对这番话感到震惊，但聪明地没有在外表上显露出来，直到加持继续说道。"看看代码 2-A。"

"That's Shinji's and Asuka's class number." Misato whispered recognizing the alphanumeric code. "What the hell is going on?"  
"那是真嗣和明日香的班级编号。" 美里低声说道，认出了这个字母数字代码。"这到底是怎么回事？"

**Later**

The bell ending the school day sounded and class 2-A began to file out of the classroom and fill the halls with gripping, laughing and discussions of future plans. Amid all the commotion a shy girl with pigtails went up to her crush in a black track suit.  
放学铃声响起，2-A 班的同学们陆续走出教室，走廊里顿时充满了欢声笑语和关于未来计划的讨论。在一片喧闹中，一个扎着双马尾的害羞女孩走向了她暗恋的那个穿着黑色运动服的男生。

"Don't forget you have the bulletin duty this week Suzahara." Hikari said in her most official tone of voice as she handed Toji the thick stack of papers, trying to hide her feelings behind the façade of her responsibilities.  
“别忘了这周是你负责公告栏，铃原。”光用她最正式的语气说道，同时将一叠厚厚的纸递给东治，试图在职责的外表下隐藏自己的情感。

"I've got what?" Toji the basketball loving jock responded to class 2-A's representative in his most dumbfounded tone.  
“我负责什么？”东治，这个热爱篮球的体育生，用他最困惑的语气回应着 2-A 班的班长。

"The class bulletin remember. You're supposed to deliver this to Miss Ayanami." She said holding the printouts up to his face.  
"班级公告记得吧。你应该把这个交给绫波老师。" 她边说边把打印件举到他面前。

"Oh come on. Who else has duty?" An exasperated Toji pleaded.  
"哎呀，别这样。还有谁有任务？" 苦恼的冬二恳求道。

"It's you and Ayanami this week." Hikari said matter-of-factly.  
"这周是你和绫波。" 光子直截了当地说。

"It's Ayanami and me. Well I guess I gotta." Toji said resigning himself to his fate. "But I can't go to some girl's place by myself!" Toji said exasperatedly twisting his body with hands holding the sheets of paper up at his head as if hoping the knowledge contained within could by osmosis enter his brain to help him solve the absurdity of what this world asked of him.  
"是绫波和我。好吧，我想我得去了。" 真嗣无奈地接受了自己的命运。"但我不能一个人去女生家里！" 真嗣焦急地扭动着身体，双手举着纸张在头顶，仿佛希望知识能通过渗透进入他的大脑，帮助他解决这个荒谬的世界对他的要求。

"Well I…" Hikari began too quietly for Toji to hear.  
"嗯，我……" 光开始说话，但声音太小，真嗣听不见。

"Hey Shinji! Walk home with me would you, you know where Ayanami lives right?" Toji called out across the room at his friend. As he made his way toward the door holding the bound pages in front of him.  
"嘿，真嗣！跟我一起回家好吗，你知道绫波住哪儿吧？" 真嗣在房间里向朋友喊道。他拿着装订好的页面向门口走去。

"Sure." Shinji answered in his normal nervous and unsure tone, especially considering what had happened the last time he went to Ayanami's apartment.  
“当然。”真嗣用他一贯紧张而不确定的声音回答，尤其是考虑到上次他去绫波家发生的事情。

Now Asuka had been listening intently to the exchange. She'd been waiting in the hall so she could walk home with Shinji. She hadn't heard the offer of Hikari to go with Toji but she had seen the dejected look on her friend and confidante's face when she looked into the classroom as she heard the jock say her lover's name.  
此时，明日香一直在专注地听着他们的对话。她一直在走廊里等着，以便和真嗣一起回家。她没有听到光邀请剑一起去的事，但她看到当她听到那个运动员提到她爱人的名字时，她的朋友兼知己脸上失落的表情。

Asuka also remembers what happened the last time Shinji had been alone with wondergirl. The German redhead was insanely, unbelievably jealous. When she had found out that hers was not the first naked body or breast that Shinji had seen and felt, and that that honor belonged to Rei it had nearly ended their budding relationship.  
明日香也记得上次真嗣和那个神秘女孩独处时发生的事。这位德国红发女孩嫉妒得发狂，难以置信。当她得知真嗣看到的第一个裸体和乳房不是她的，而是属于绫波时，他们刚刚萌芽的关系差点就此结束。

"_If you cannot be mine and mine only, I don't even want you."_  
"如果你不能只属于我一个人，那我宁愿不要你。"

"_Just let me explain! It was an accident! You wanted us to be honest with each other!"_  
"就让我解释一下！那是个意外！你说过我们要彼此坦诚的！"

"_How do you accidently end up on top of a naked girl! I bet you fucked her too, right then and there you pervert!"_  
"你怎么会不小心压在一个裸女身上！我敢打赌你当时就上了她，对吧，你这个变态！"

"_Like you wanted to on_ Over the Rainbow _with Kaji!?"_  
"就像你在《跨越彩虹》和加治想做的那样！？"

_She slapped him. Harder than she had slapped anyone ever in her life. He had brought his head back up clenched and unclenched his hand before embracing her tightly, she hit him hard several more times disgusted by his presence until finally her rage dissipated and they rocked back and forth in each other's arms saying volumes with their silence.  
她狠狠地扇了他一巴掌，力度之大，是她这辈子从未对任何人施展过的。他抬起头，紧握又松开拳头，然后紧紧拥抱着她，她厌恶他的存在，又重重地打了几次，直到最终怒气消散，两人在彼此的怀抱中摇晃，用沉默传递着千言万语。_

She shuddered at how it had all almost come crashing down. It had been that day that they both fully realized people aren't your perfect dolls that you use when you want and then forget about, they are imperfect creatures themselves with their own needs and desires. Finding love is only the first step. Keeping it is the hard part.  
她因这一切几乎崩溃而颤抖。正是那天，他们才真正意识到，人们不是你想要时拿来用、不想要时就忘掉的完美玩偶，他们本身就是有自己需求和欲望的不完美生物。找到爱只是第一步，维系爱才是艰难的部分。

Then she snorted at all the "creative" explanations they had given Misato later for all of Shinji's bruises. Frightened penguins and open doors had been her favorite.  
然后她对所有那些他们后来给美里编造的“创意”解释嗤之以鼻，关于真嗣身上的瘀伤。受惊的企鹅和敞开的门是她最喜欢的。

"Two boys, especially perverts like you two, can't just go to a girl's home." Asuka interjected into Toji and Shinji's conversation deciding that she would help Hikari get what she wanted. "Especially when she lives alone!" Asuka paused a moment and raised a pointed finger at Shinji before continuing "And besides, this baka forgot our lunches today and he owes me food!" Asuka loudly proclaimed despite knowing full well the reason Shinji forgot to make their lunches was _at least_ half her fault.  
“两个男孩，尤其是像你们这样的变态，不能随便去女孩子的家。”明日香插入了东治和真嗣的对话，决定帮助光子得到她想要的。“尤其是当她一个人住的时候！”明日香停顿了一下，用手指着真嗣，继续说道：“而且，这个笨蛋今天忘了给我们准备午餐，他欠我吃的！”明日香大声宣布，尽管她完全知道真嗣忘记做午餐的原因至少有一半是她的错。

"Does the demon want to tag along?" Toji asked unenthusiastically with a scowl on his face as he looked at the redhead.  
“恶魔想一起来吗？”东治不情愿地问道，脸上带着不悦的表情看着红发女孩。

"I don't want to go with you two alone either, it'd be sooo boring." Asuka said in her trademark superior tone of voice "Hikari wanna keep me company?" She said as she looked across the room at her best friend.  
"我也不想单独跟你们两个去，太无聊了。" 明日香用她那标志性的高傲语气说道，"光，要不要陪我一起？" 她环视房间，看向她最好的朋友。

"Sure." The class representative said a smile spread across her face.  
"当然。" 班长微笑着回答，笑容在她脸上绽放。

The group of four made their way across the city under the sweltering Tokyo-3 sun. During this escapade, Asuka "remembered' she had "important pilot business" to discuss with Shinji and the two of them went ahead and left Toji and Hikari alone with each other. When they rejoined the jock and class representative just before climbing the stairs both were blushing a bit and Asuka had a small grin on her face: 'Mission accomplished Sohryu.' She thought.  
四人组在东京-3 酷热的阳光下穿越城市。在这段冒险中，明日香"突然想起"她有"重要的驾驶员事务"要与真嗣讨论，于是两人先行离开，留下阿薰和班长单独相处。当他们再次汇合，即将爬上楼梯时，两人都有些脸红，而明日香脸上露出一丝得意的微笑：'任务完成，惣流。' 她心想。

"Are you sure this is the right place?" Toji asked Shinji as they looked at a rusted door with piles of mail and magazines stuffed in its mail slot.  
"你确定这里是正确的地方吗？" 真嗣和冬二看着一扇锈迹斑斑的门，门上的信箱塞满了邮件和杂志。

"It's the address listed in the school records." Hikari said as she looked with dismay at the pile of untouched correspondence, including quite a few older bulletins and printouts. Hikari stepped forward: "Miss Ayanami are you in there?" she asked as she knocked on the door only for it to slide open and stand slightly agape.  
"学校记录上列的就是这个地址。" 光子带着失望的表情看着那堆未拆的信件，包括不少旧的公告和打印资料。光子走上前去："绫波同学，你在里面吗？" 她敲了敲门，结果门只是微微滑开，她有些惊讶地站在那里。

"There's not even a lock?" Asuka asked genuinely dumbfounded as she had assumed that part of Shinji's story about Rei's apartment could not possibly have been true. How does a young girl live all alone in a place with a door that can't be locked?  
"连个锁都没有？" 明日香真的感到难以置信，她原本以为真嗣关于绫波公寓的故事中有些部分不可能是真的。一个年轻女孩怎么可能独自住在一个连门都锁不上的地方？

"Well she's not here so let's leave the bulletin and get out of here." Toji said seeing no other path forward.  
"她不在这儿，所以我们留下便条就走吧。" 冬二说道，觉得没有其他办法了。

"She'll never see it if we leave it here." Shinji said as he pushed open the slightly ajar door and went into Ayanami's apartment.  
"如果我们把它留在这儿，她永远也看不到。" 真嗣说着，推开半掩的门，走进了绫波的公寓。

"Wait baka!" Asuka said taking off her shoes as she followed him in. Toji and Hikari looked at each other for a moment before sighing and following their pilot friends into Rei's place.  
"等等，笨蛋！" 明日香一边说着，一边脱下鞋子跟着他进去。冬二和光相互看了一眼，叹了口气，随后跟着他们的驾驶员朋友进入了绫波的住处。

"When you said it was run-down this is not what I thought you meant." Asuka said in visible shock at how the First Child lived. The group of four wandered a bit, taking in the grimy and decrepit apartment. Toji and Shinji walked up to Rei's small cot. Dirty bandages and trash lying exactly where they had been the last time Shinji had been here. Just as Toji set the class bulletin on Rei's bed he heard scratching and shuffling to his left.  
"你说的破旧原来是这个意思，我真是没想到。" 明日香震惊地看着第一适格者居住的环境。四人小组在这肮脏破败的公寓里徘徊，观察着四周。真治和薰走近了绫波的小床。脏兮兮的绷带和垃圾就那样散落在原地，和真治上次来时一模一样。正当薰把班级公告放在绫波床上时，他听到左边传来了抓挠和拖动的声音。

"What are you doing?" Toji asked as he saw Shinji knelt on the floor.  
"你在干什么？" 薰看到真治跪在地上，问道。

"Cleaning." Shinji said briefly as he got a bag.  
"打扫。" 真治简短地回答，拿起了一个袋子。

"Well I won't help. It's just not manly!" Toji said as he saw Shinji clean up the discarded bandages and wrappers from the floor into a trash bag.  
“我才不帮忙呢。这太不爷们了！” 当看到真嗣将地板上丢弃的绷带和包装纸捡进垃圾袋时，冬二说道。

"Suzuhara!" Hikari began in her most commanding voice, "We can't just leave her living like this! She obviously needs help. Now take this broom, I'll take the dustpan." Hikari said holding the cleaning tools she had found, somewhere, up to his sweat-dropping face.  
“铃原！” 光用她最命令式的语气开口了，“我们不能就这样让她这样生活下去！她显然需要帮助。现在拿着这把扫帚，我来拿簸箕。” 光说着，将她不知从哪儿找到的清洁工具举到他汗流浃背的脸前。

"Yes…" Toji said and grabbed the proffered broom and they began to work in tandem while Asuka went to the kitchen and washed the pile of dirty dishes that lay in the sink, peculiarly it was just one set of table and silverware:  
“是……” 冬二说着，接过递来的扫帚，他们开始默契地一起工作，而明日香则走进厨房，清洗水槽里堆积如山的脏盘子，奇怪的是，那只是一套餐具：

"Almost like she only uses this when she needs to." Asuka said to herself. Before she had thought that Rei Ayanami had just been stuck-up, the favorite who knew it, but after seeing this Asuka wasn't sure. She told herself the shaking in her limbs was from the cold water and not the implication that Rei really _was_ like a doll. A perfect little soldier that didn't even think or breath unless she was ordered to, 'Is that what they want for all their pilots?'  
“简直像是只在需要时才用这个。”明日香自言自语道。之前她一直以为绫波零只是自命不凡，知道自己备受宠爱，但看到这一幕后，明日香不再那么确定了。她告诉自己四肢的颤抖是因为冷水，而非绫波真如玩偶般的暗示。一个完美的小士兵，除非被命令，否则连思考和呼吸都不会，“这就是他们想要所有驾驶员成为的样子吗？”

"We'll talk later." Shinji whispered in her ear, breaking her out of her brooding, while a reassuring hand squeezed her arm as he came to the kitchen to look for another trash bag and correctly surmised the unsettling thoughts going through her mind.  
“我们晚点再谈。”真嗣在她耳边低语，打断了她的沉思，同时一只安抚的手握紧了她的手臂，他来到厨房寻找另一个垃圾袋，并正确地猜到了她心中不安的想法。

Just then they heard the door open and went out to see the First child as she was taking off her shoes in the hallway.  
就在这时，他们听到门打开的声音，走出去看到第一适格者正在走廊里脱鞋。

"Hi Rei, we did some cleaning, I hope that's okay." Shinji said in his not-quite nervous, not-quite confident tone of voice he was known for as the group gathered around and put the last finishing touches on their, for lack of a better word, Spring cleaning, despite Japan no longer having seasons.  
"嗨，丽，我们做了些打扫，希望你没意见。" 真嗣用他那既不紧张也不自信的独特语调说道，大家围拢过来，为他们的，找不到更好词来形容的，春季大扫除做最后的收尾工作，尽管日本已不再有四季之分。

"Miss Ayanami pardon me but isn't living in this place just a bit… uncomfortable?" Hikari said trying to be tactful as Toji put away the broom Rei had never used.  
"绫波小姐，请原谅我的冒昧，但住在这里是不是有点……不舒服？" 光子尽量委婉地说道，同时东治把丽从未用过的扫帚收了起来。

"It's the accommodation provided for me by NERV. It is sufficient." Rei said plainly.  
"这是 NERV 为我提供的住所。已经足够了。" 丽平淡地回答。

"If you say so." Hikari said being not quite convinced. Before Asuka stepped into the conversation:  
"既然你这么说。" 光说，语气中带着些许不确信。随后，明日香加入了对话：

"Shinji forgot our lunches today so we're going to a burger joint and he's buying. Want to come wondergirl?" Asuka offered. She should have been hostile to the most serious threat to her relationship with Shinji but strangely she wasn't. Maybe it was the fact Rei was her fellow pilot, maybe it was seeing the squalor in which she lived, or maybe Asuka was just outgrowing her teenage angst.  
"真嗣今天忘了带我们的午餐，所以我们打算去汉堡店，他请客。想一起来吗，奇迹女孩？" 明日香提议道。她本应对这个与她和真嗣关系最大的威胁抱有敌意，但奇怪的是她并没有。也许是因为丽是她的同僚飞行员，也许是因为看到了她居住的简陋环境，又或许明日香正在逐渐摆脱她的青春期烦恼。

"No I have already eaten. Thank you." Rei replied, her standard noncommittal tone just a touch bright as she uttered her thanks to the group of four for their kindness and invitation.  
"不了，我已经吃过了。谢谢你们。" 丽回答道，她的标准中性语气中略带一丝明快，对这四人的好意和邀请表示感谢。

"Well suit yourself." Asuka said in her usual tone of voice before continuing, "Take care Ayanami." Asuka said in a soft tone that genuinely surprised everyone present, even Shinji. The group of four filed out of her apartment taking the filled bags of trash to be dropped in a waiting dumpster and leaving the blue-haired girl to lie on her small cot holding an old pair of cracked glasses alone with her own thoughts.  
“随你便吧。”明日香用她一贯的语气说道，随后继续，“保重，绫波。”她用一种柔软的语调说道，这真切地让在场的每个人都感到惊讶，甚至包括真嗣。这四人组带着装满的垃圾袋走出她的公寓，将它们扔进等待的垃圾箱，留下蓝发女孩独自躺在她的小床上，手里拿着一副破旧的裂开的眼镜，沉浸在自己的思绪中。

"I've never said thank you before." Rei said as she pondered the words she had used today. What they had meant, who she had said them to, and why. "Not even to him." She said as she squeezed the glasses in her hand and the first twinges of what humans call doubt crept into her psyche.  
“我从未说过谢谢。”绫波说道，她思考着今天使用的这些词。它们意味着什么，她对谁说了这些话，以及为什么。“甚至没有对他说过。”她紧握着手中的眼镜，人类称之为怀疑的最初感觉悄然潜入她的心灵。

**Some Days Later 几天后**

A Major Katsuragi in full uniform, complete with a beret and a jacket that was actually buttoned up, stood in the doorway to her apartment with the setting sun behind her and a few bags next to her legs. She looked back into the hallway where her two wards were standing to wish her goodbye.  
一位身着全套制服的葛城美里少校，头戴贝雷帽，夹克扣得严严实实，站在她公寓的门口，夕阳在她身后映衬，几袋行李放在她的腿边。她回头望向走廊，那里她的两个被监护人正站在那里向她道别。

"Alright kids I'm going to Matsushiro, if all goes well I'll be back in a few days." Misato said desperately hoping in vain she hadn't jinxed it. "Kaji said he'll be here by seven."  
“好了，孩子们，我要去松代了，如果一切顺利的话，我几天后就回来。”美里说，绝望地希望自己没有乌鸦嘴。“加持说他七点会到这里。”

"Why do we need a babysitter? We got through one night alone, I think we could survive three or four by ourselves. We're not little kids you know!" Asuka complained and reminded Misato of her borderline negligence, causing her to wince before smiling and counter Asuka's barbs with some of her own.  
“为什么我们需要保姆？我们自己度过了一晚，我觉得我们完全可以自己撑过三四天。我们又不是小孩子，你知道的！”明日香抱怨道，提醒美里她近乎疏忽的行为，让她不禁皱眉，然后微笑着用她自己的话回击明日香。

"I thought you be thrilled to be spending three days with Kaji?" Misato responded in her most teasing voice.  
"我以为你会很兴奋能和加持一起度过三天呢？" 美里用她最挑逗的语气回应道。

"Yes, but it's the principle of the matter Misato! And besides nothing interesting will happen with this baka here!" Asuka said harrumphing and bushing at her guardian's jibes.  
"是的，但这关乎原则问题，美里！而且有这个笨蛋在，什么有趣的事都不会发生！" 明日香哼了一声，对她的监护人的嘲讽表示不满。

"Be careful Misato." Shinji said interposing himself into the war of words between his secret lover and commanding officer.  
"小心点，美里。" 真嗣插话进来，介入了他秘密爱人和指挥官之间的口角。

"Did you guys find a pilot yet? I want some fresh competition." Asuka said excitedly as she balled her hand up into a fist.  
"你们找到飞行员了吗？我想要一些新鲜的竞争。" 明日香兴奋地说着，将手握成拳头。

"We have…but we'll be using the dummy plug for the initial activation." Misato said clearly in some disquiet as her mind raced with questions about why, just why the pilots were chosen, and how? If only she had more info to go on.  
"我们已经找到了……但初始激活将使用模拟插头。" 美里有些不安地说道，她的脑海中充满了关于为何选择这些飞行员以及如何选择的疑问。如果她能有更多的信息就好了。

"Because of what happened at 2nd Branch?" Shinji asked sullenly.  
"因为第二支部发生的事？" 真嗣闷闷不乐地问道。

"Yeah." Misato said remembering after the previous synch-test when Shinji and Asuka had both come to her and to tell her about Rei's living conditions. She told them there wasn't much she could do at the time since getting Unit-03 operational was the absolute priority but she promised she'd raise their concerns with Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki after the initial activation. Neither were happy with that response but they accepted it, especially after Misato told them what had happened in Nevada. Why had she been forthcoming with her wards? Usually she tried to keep them, especially Shinji, out of the more gritty realities of NERV, maybe it was the fact that she had almost lost both of them and wanted to be a better surrogate mother to them?  
“嗯。”美里回忆起之前同步测试后，真嗣和明日香一起来找她，告诉她关于绫波生活条件的事。她告诉他们，当时她能做的有限，因为使三号机投入运行是绝对优先事项，但她承诺在初次激活后会向副司令冬月提出他们的担忧。两人对这个答复都不太满意，但还是接受了，尤其是在美里告诉他们内华达发生的事情之后。为什么她会对她的孩子们坦白？通常她会尽量让他们，特别是真嗣，远离 NERV 更残酷的现实，也许是因为她差点失去他们两个，想要成为一个更好的代理母亲。

"Who's the new pilot?" Asuka asked trying to change the grim subject matter.  
“新驾驶员是谁？”明日香试图改变这个沉重的话题。

"He'll tell you himself, after the activation tests and when Unit-03 is added to the force." Misato said, that had been one of the few things he had requested, aside from the help for his sister.  
“他会亲自告诉你们的，在激活测试完成后，当三号机加入战斗序列时。”美里说，这是他为数不多的请求之一，除了帮助他的妹妹。

"OOOHHH IT'S a **HE** I wonder if he's cute, he can't possibly be as boring as this baka!" Shinji bristled at Asuka's words while Misato couldn't resist laughing out loud, now she was really looking forward to when Asuka figured out who the pilot was and what her reaction would be. Wiping a tear from her eye she continued:  
"哦哦哦，是个男的，不知道他帅不帅，总不可能比这个笨蛋还无聊吧！" 真嗣对明日香的话感到不悦，而美里忍不住放声大笑，现在她真的很期待明日香发现驾驶员是谁时会有什么反应。她擦去眼角的泪水，继续说道：

"Goodbye kids don't kill each other before Kaji gets here." Misato said as she grabbed the bags and the door to the apartment hissed closed.  
"再见了孩子们，别在加持来之前互相残杀。" 美里说着抓起袋子，公寓的门嘶嘶地关上了。

"I'm boring?" Shinji said as he turned his head to look at Asuka.  
"我很无聊吗？" 真嗣转过头看着明日香说道。

"Gotta keep up the ruse _leibling._" She said as she turned her whole body and put her hands on her hips in a dramatic, confident pose.  
"得继续保持这个假象，小兄弟。" 她说着，整个身体转了过来，双手叉腰，摆出一个戏剧性而又自信的姿势。

"I know, but that doesn't make the words any easier to hear." Shinji said with a dejected tone.  
"我知道，但这并不让那些话听起来更容易接受。" 真嗣带着沮丧的语气说道。

Asuka sighed. 明日香叹了口气。

"Let me show you what you mean to me." Asuka said as she pressed her body up against his and pushed his back to the wall. Both of them were still in their school clothes and Shinji felt his lower head start to grow at Asuka being so close and so obviously in I-want-sex mode. He still thought she was sexy in their uniforms even though it didn't accentuate her figure much. "After all aren't actions better than words." She said as she knelt down in front of him and undid the belt to his pants.  
"让我向你展示你对我意味着什么。" 明日香说着，将身体紧贴在他身上，把他推到墙边。两人都还穿着校服，真嗣感觉到自己的下半身开始有了反应，因为明日香靠得如此之近，明显处于想要性爱的状态。尽管制服并没有太多凸显她的身材，他仍然觉得她穿着制服很性感。"毕竟，行动不是比言语更有力吗？" 她一边说，一边跪在他面前，解开了他裤子的腰带。

His cock popped out as she brought his boxers to the floor. Though it wasn't at attention as much as Asuka wanted so she undid the clasps and pulled down the front of uniform along with her bra to expose her breasts.  
随着她将他的内裤拉到地板上，他的阴茎弹了出来。虽然它并没有像明日香希望的那样勃起，于是她解开扣子，拉下制服的前襟和胸罩，露出她的胸部。

"Look at me Shinji." Asuka said as she wiggled her chest back and forth causing her breasts to jiggle. This had the desired effect and Shinji's member was now as hard as it could be.  
"看着我，真嗣。" 明日香说着，扭动胸部，让它们摇晃起来。这产生了预期的效果，真嗣的阴茎现在硬得不能再硬了。

Asuka took his dick in her hands and began softly kissing the cockhead, before moving her kisses down the bottom of his shaft to his balls, sucking on each in turn while her hand softly stroked his shaft. The stimulation caused Shinji's cock to start leaking precum. Asuka noticed the shiny liquid and shifted her attention from Shinji's balls to his cock. She took the head into her mouth and swirled her tongue around it, tasting the saltiness and sweat of his unwashed cock mixing with the particular taste of his precum.  
明日香握住他的阴茎，开始温柔地亲吻龟头，然后沿着他的阴茎向下移动，吻到他的睾丸，轮流吸吮每一个，同时她的手轻轻抚摸着他的阴茎。这种刺激让真嗣的阴茎开始分泌前液。明日香注意到了那闪亮的液体，将注意力从真嗣的睾丸转移到他的阴茎上。她将龟头含入口中，用舌头环绕舔舐，品尝着未清洗的阴茎的咸味与他的前液特有的味道混合在一起。

Asuka soon moved her lips past Shinji's cockhead and her head went up and down on his shaft as she sucked. Shinji brought his hands up to Asuka's head to guide her and absently play with the bright hair he loved. Her eyes were closed as she concentrated on her task. Each time her mouth got closer and closer to the base of his shaft, until finally in one swift motion she brought her lips to the end of his cock, taking the entire member into her mouth.  
不久，明日香将嘴唇移过真嗣的龟头，她的头上下移动，吸吮着他的阴茎。真嗣抬起手放在明日香的头上，引导她并漫不经心地玩弄着他喜爱的亮丽头发。她闭着眼睛，专注于她的任务。每次她的嘴越来越接近阴茎的根部，直到最后，她迅速地将嘴唇移到阴茎的末端，将整个阴茎含入嘴中。

She held her head there for several moments, gagging on his cock, her throat and lips vibrating against his shaft while her lips dripped saliva across his crotch and the wrinkles of his balls, leaving a noticeable pool on the floor between them. Finally she came up for air though as she did so she kept gently stroking his cock and balls with her hands as she looked up into his eyes, the question written plainly on her face:  
她将头埋在那里好一会儿，被他的阴茎呛得干呕，喉咙和嘴唇在他的肉棒上颤动，而她的唇边滴下的唾液顺着他的腹股沟和阴囊的皱褶流淌，在他们之间的地板上留下了一滩明显的痕迹。最终她抬起头来呼吸，尽管如此，她还是温柔地用手抚摸着他的阴茎和阴囊，同时抬头凝视着他的眼睛，脸上的疑问清晰可见：

'Do you believe me now that my heart is yours and yours alone?'  
“你现在相信我了吗？我的心只属于你，独一无二。”

Shinji looked down at her shimmering eyes and nodded in response to her wordless question. Asuka smiled, a genuine smile, no one since her mother had seen besides Shinji.  
真嗣低头看着她闪烁的眼睛，对她无声的疑问点了点头。明日香笑了，一个真挚的笑容，除了真嗣，自她母亲以来再无人见过。

Asuka returned her mouth to Shinji's cock sucking slowly and sensually while her hand cupped at his balls. It wasn't the most intense fellatio he had ever experienced from Asuka but there was something about the emotional weight and understanding behind it that made him feel like he was in heaven. Shinji didn't want it to end but soon enough he spoke his warning:  
明日香将嘴重新贴回真嗣的阴茎上，缓慢而性感地吮吸着，同时用手抚摸着他的睾丸。这并非她最激烈的一次口交，但其中蕴含的情感重量和理解让他感觉仿佛置身天堂。真嗣不希望这一切结束，但很快他发出了警告：

"Asuka I'm…" Shinji began as he felt the pressure in his balls grow to quickly for him to hold back any longer.  
“明日香，我……”真嗣开口说道，他感到睾丸中的压力迅速增长，已无法再忍耐。

Asuka removed her mouth from Shinji's shaft and stroke his cock furiously as he shot his load onto her waiting breasts. Five or six thick spurts landed on the German redhead's bust. Most on her left and with the rest on her right. The splotches of cum soon became streams as they flowed down her breasts, most flowing towards the crevasse in her bosom while one made it's way to her left nipple, covering it in the gooey stickiness of his seed.  
明日香从真嗣的阴茎上移开嘴，疯狂地套弄着他的阴茎，他随即射出了精液，喷洒在她等待着的胸部上。五六股浓稠的精液落在了这位德国红发女孩的胸前，大部分落在左边，其余的则在右边。这些精液斑点很快变成了流下她胸部的细流，大部分流向了她胸间的沟壑，而有一股则流到了她的左乳头上，覆盖上了他黏稠的种子。

"Let's go to the bed now." Asuka said as she got up from her knees and led him down the halls.  
“我们现在去床上吧。”明日香说着，从跪坐中起身，领着他穿过走廊。

Soon both were cleaned up and in their birthday suits and Asuka placed her ass on a pillow to give Shinji better access to her most private place. His fingers and lips started out slowly and softly, probing her inner thighs and hairless outer lips. Eventually his index finger made it inside her pussy, followed soon after by his middle finger while his tongue danced around her opening teasing her clit and folds.  
很快两人都清洗干净，赤裸相对，明日香将臀部置于枕头上，以便真嗣更好地触及她最私密的地方。他的手指和嘴唇开始缓慢而轻柔，探索着她的大腿内侧和无毛的外唇。最终，他的食指进入了她的蜜穴，紧接着中指也紧随其后，而他的舌头则在她的入口周围舞动，挑逗着她的阴蒂和褶皱。

His fingers softly stroking at her insides, finding wrinkly and curved flesh covered in sticky substances as his touch aroused her ravenous sex drive. Only for his digits to leave. She was about to ask what was wrong when she felt his tongue enter her and ferociously lap at her insides while his hands went to breasts and pinched at her nipples. It was just too much, her building crescendo washed over her as she came, causing her thighs to grip Shinji's head like it was in a vise while her entire body shook in several moments of pure bliss.  
他的手指温柔地在她体内抚摸，触碰到布满粘稠液体的皱褶和弯曲的肉体，他的触摸激起了她强烈的性欲。正当他的手指即将离开时，她感到他的舌头侵入，狂野地舔舐着她的内壁，而他的双手则移向她的乳房，捏弄着她的乳头。这一切太过强烈，她不断累积的高潮如潮水般涌来，让她的大腿紧紧夹住真嗣的头，仿佛将其固定在钳子中，而她的整个身体则在纯粹的极乐中颤抖不已。

She was still coming down from her orgasm when Shinji released himself from her grip and placed his member at her opening. It had stiffened during his bout of cunnilingus but seeing her response to his actions had made it rock hard and the head glisten with precum. He brought her hips back up onto the pillow and slid his cock into her wet and waiting pussy.  
她还在高潮的余韵中未完全平复，真嗣便从她的紧握中挣脱，将自己的阳具对准她的入口。在之前的口爱过程中，它已经变得坚挺，但看到她对这些行为的反应，它变得更加硬挺，顶端闪烁着前液的光泽。他将她的臀部再次抬高至枕头上，缓缓将自己的肉棒插入她湿润而渴望的小穴中。

He grabbed Asuka's legs and brought them up to his chest so that her flexible limbs were straight up and down and her body made a right angle as the bottom of her feet saw the ceiling. Shinji stroked into her gently with his stiff member. As he did so he brought his left hand to their connected groins and gently played with Asuka's pussy where her labia split, where her clitoris was. He wasn't sure whether Asuka's legs were trembling from the strain of being up in the air or his ministrations. But Asuka's hand gripping his right thigh seemed like a good indication of the latter.  
他抓住明日香的腿，将它们抬至胸前，使她柔韧的肢体笔直向上，身体形成一个直角，脚底对着天花板。真嗣用他坚硬的阳具温柔地抽插着。与此同时，他用左手抚摸着他们相连的下体，轻轻玩弄着明日香小穴的裂缝处，那里是她的阴蒂所在。他不确定明日香的腿是因为悬空而颤抖，还是因为他的爱抚。但明日香紧抓他右大腿的手似乎表明了后者。

Shinji began gently moving his cock in and out of her while his hand continued to play with her most sensitive area. His thumb brushed against his own shaft as it went in and out of his lover and he was shocked at how hard it was, covered in her sticky juices and briefly thought how it must feel to be in Asuka's position.  
真嗣开始温柔地在她体内抽动他的阴茎，同时他的手继续在她最敏感的区域游走。他的拇指在进出爱人的身体时擦过自己的阴茎，他惊讶于它的坚硬，沾满了她黏稠的爱液，并短暂地想象着处于明日香的位置会是什么感觉。

She felt his balls tightening as they brushed her thighs with each thrust, getting closer and closer to releasing their load into her, the anticipation of feeling the cum shoot into her, impact her walls was intoxicating, she wanted it so bad…  
她感觉到他的睾丸随着每一次挺进紧贴着她的大腿，越来越接近释放，那种期待着精液射入她体内、冲击她内壁的感觉令人陶醉，她渴望极了……

Just then she felt Shinji increase his speed and then suddenly stop as she felt ropey strands of his seed shoot into her filling her up the sensation sending her over the edge as she brought her shaking legs down and grabbed at Shinji's back bringing him down to her and into a passionate kiss as she felt the last of Shinji's cum spurt into her.  
就在这时，她感觉到真嗣加快了速度，然后突然停下，她感到一股股浓稠的精液射入她体内，填满了她，这种感觉让她达到了高潮，她颤抖着放下双腿，抓住真嗣的背部，将他拉向自己，深深地吻在一起，同时感受到真嗣最后的精液喷射进她的体内。

They stayed kissing for a moment, Shinji's still hard cock gently moving out of her and letting the cum pour out. The viscous white stream slowing moving from Asuka's pussy and onto the pillow beneath her. Staining the case with a tell-tale dark patch of drying liquid.  
他们继续拥吻了一会儿，真嗣坚挺的阴茎缓缓从她体内退出，让精液流淌而出。那黏稠的白色液体缓缓从明日香的下体流出，滴落在她身下的枕头上，在枕套上留下了一块显眼的深色干渍。

They then moved so they were lying down next to each other, hands intertwined between them. Both sure the love between them was genuine, the anxiety and angst that had permeated and suffocated most of their lives melting away into the fog of their afterglow.  
随后，他们挪动身体，并排躺下，双手在彼此之间交缠。两人都确信彼此间的爱是真挚的，那些曾渗透并窒息他们大部分生活的焦虑与痛苦，此刻都消融在欢愉后的迷雾中。

But it was not to last, a shrill noise announced their return to reality and its never-ending problems.  
然而，这美好并未持续太久，一阵尖锐的声响宣告了他们回归现实及其无休止的烦恼。

"We better get dressed unless we want Kaji to see us like this." Shinji said as he silenced the alarm they had set in case they lost track of time, which happened frequently during their bouts of passion.  
“我们最好穿上衣服，不然让加持先生看到我们这样就糟了。”真嗣说着，按停了他们为防止忘记时间而设的闹钟，这种情况在他们激情缠绵时屡见不鲜。

"What do you think they'd do if they found out?" Asuka said as she brought her legs up to her chest in a fetal position. Ever since their relationship started that thought had permeated her mind. 'Probably separate us.' Asuka thought darkly. In the back of her mind she had always believed they had a trump card that would allow them to stay together, by refusing to pilot and presenting NERV with a fait accompli if worse came to worse. Her conscious mind had always doubted if that plan would work, NERV might call their bluff, replace them, and send Asuka back to Germany and keep Shinji in Japan. Especially now since they were grounded their worth was at an all-time low to the organization.  
“你觉得他们要是发现了会怎么做？”明日香蜷缩成胎儿姿势，双腿紧贴胸前说道。自从他们开始这段关系以来，这个念头就一直萦绕在她心头。‘大概会把我们分开吧。’明日香阴郁地想。在她内心深处，她始终相信他们有一张王牌，那就是拒绝驾驶 EVA，向 NERV 展示既成事实，如果情况恶化到极点的话。但她的理智一直怀疑这个计划是否可行，NERV 可能会识破他们的虚张声势，替换他们，把明日香送回德国，而真嗣则留在日本。特别是现在他们被停飞了，对组织的价值降到了历史最低点。

"They won't, not if we're careful." Shinji said as he put his hand on her knee and squeezed.  
“他们不会知道的，只要我们小心点。”真嗣说着，把手放在她的膝盖上，轻轻捏了一下。

"Baka, hand me my panties." She said after giving him a warm kiss on the lips.  
"笨蛋，把我的内裤递给我。" 她在他唇上留下一个温暖的吻后说道。

"The red ones?" Shinji asked as he crossed the room to open her drawer.  
"红色的那条吗？" 真嗣边问边穿过房间去打开她的抽屉。

"Yeah. Do you know what your jock-stooge did to be called in to the principal's office two days in a row?" Asuka said changing the subject as she caught the panties Shinji tossed to her.  
"对。你知道你的运动健将跟班做了什么，连续两天被叫到校长办公室吗？" 明日香接住真嗣扔给她的内裤，顺势转换了话题。

"No. He wouldn't say." Shinji said as he put on his own boxers "Kensuke kept asking if I knew any more about 2nd Branch or Unit-03's transfer and if they had a pilot yet." Shinji continued as he handed Asuka the matching bra for her panties.  
“不，他没说。” 真嗣边说边穿上自己的内裤，“健介一直追问我是否知道更多关于第二支部或零三号机转移的情况，以及它们是否已经有了驾驶员。” 真嗣继续说着，同时递给明日香与她内裤相配的胸罩。

"He really is a hopeless otaku, I'm surprised he didn't come and beg Misato to make him a pilot." Asuka said as she placed the cups around her mounds and straps on her should before reaching around her back to clasp the garment in place.  
“他真是个无可救药的御宅族，我真惊讶他没来求美里让他当驾驶员。” 明日香说着，将胸罩的罩杯围在胸前，肩带搭在肩上，然后伸手到背后扣好。

Little did the lovers know Kensuke had come to try and beg Major Katsuragi to be a pilot, only to be nearly run over by Misato's Alpine as it rounded a corner near their apartment, leaving the Eva fanatic in tears as his chance sped off into the sunset.  
这对恋人并不知道，健介确实曾来恳求葛城少校让他成为驾驶员，结果差点被美里的阿尔派恩车在公寓附近的一个拐角处撞倒，眼看着机会随着夕阳远去，御宅族狂热者泪流满面。

In a little under thirty minutes Kaji arrived to be treated to an evening of fawning, arguments, and cold shoulders, only temporarily paused by some delicious stir-fry. Later "UN Inspector" Ryoji Kaji sat in the bathtub thinking about what he had seen transpire.  
不到三十分钟，加持便到了，迎接他的是一晚上的奉承、争吵和冷眼，只有美味的炒菜暂时打断了这些。后来，"联合国调查员"加持良治坐在浴缸里，思考着他所目睹的一切。

"The gulf between those two is deeper and wider than any ocean. Were we wrong about them?" Damn it Kaji you're supposed to be a spy.  
“他们之间的鸿沟比任何海洋都要深广。我们是不是看错了他们？”该死，加持，你可是个间谍啊。

Outside the walls of the bathroom Shinji lay with his head in Asuka's lap as she absently stroked his hair while they looked out at the rising moon and twinkling stars from a darkened living room, enjoying their brief moment of comfort in each other's company.  
在浴室外，真嗣躺在明日香的腿上，她漫不经心地抚摸着他的头发，两人从昏暗的客厅望向冉冉升起的月亮和闪烁的星星，享受着彼此相伴的短暂舒适时光。

**A/N:** So here we are. The next chapter. Let me know what you think. I tried to fit all the filler and development between the 12th and 13th Angels into this chapter and I hope it worked.  
作者的话：那么，我们来到了下一章。请告诉我你的想法。我试图在这一章中融入第 12 使徒和第 13 使徒之间的所有填充和发展内容，希望效果不错。

Quick note as we go forward the timeline of events might get strange and if it doesn't match the show or your head canon I apologize. Any mistake made is mine and mine alone, though even the EVA wiki which I have open as I'm writing this fic to be sure of everything says that the timeline of events, i.e. how much time passes between the different scenes, or even if they are in chronological order, gets really fuzzy in the last half of the episodes so I've got to do a bit of guesswork as to how much time has passed. Which is one of the reasons why this update took longer than I expected.  
快速提示：随着故事的推进，事件的时间线可能会变得奇怪，如果与原作或你的个人设定不符，我深表歉意。任何错误都是我个人的责任，尽管在我写作时打开的 EVA 维基（为了确保一切准确无误）也指出，事件的时间线，即不同场景之间的时间间隔，甚至它们是否按时间顺序排列，在剧集的后半部分变得非常模糊，因此我不得不做一些猜测来确定时间流逝。这也是这次更新比预期时间长的原因之一。

Next time Bardiel will be making an appearance but this battle will be much less traumatic than the canon one. To give you an idea this watch?v=ZpPKllWtF6Y is basically the tone most of the fights are going to be, i.e. smackdowns.  
下次巴迪尔将登场，但这场战斗将比原作中的要少些创伤。为了让你们有个概念，这个视频?v=ZpPKllWtF6Y 基本上就是大多数战斗的基调，即直接的对决。

### Chapter 7 OPERATION: GRAUPELBRECHER  

"Does it have to be so tight?" Toji asked no one in particular as he came into the Matsushiro command post from the on-site locker room.  
“非得这么紧吗？”当东治从现场更衣室进入松代指挥所时，他向四周无人地问道。

"You're probably used to the baggier clothes you wear in basketball. You should have been a swimmer or a gymnast." NERV Operations Director, Major Katsuragi said turning around to face him.  
"你大概习惯了打篮球时穿的宽松衣服。你应该去当个游泳运动员或者体操运动员。" NERV 作战部长，葛城美里少校说着转过身来面对他。

"Those aren't really a man's sport." Toji said as he crossed his arms and his face read displeasure.  
"那些可不算男人的运动。" 真嗣说，他交叉双臂，脸上露出不悦的表情。

"Ah, you don't want me to see you in a skin-tight speedo?" Misato said in her most playful voice as she leaned toward him with her index finger on her chin.  
"啊，你不想让我看到你穿紧身泳裤的样子吗？" 美里用她最俏皮的声音说道，同时用食指抵着下巴，身体向他倾斜。

"Shinji wasn't kidding about your teasing was he." Toji sweat dropped as he remembered the stories the Third Child would tell him about his home life. "Does it hurt?" Toji said, his tone becoming much more serious as he remembered the strain written on Shinji's face when he and Kensuke were in the entry plug with him during the fight with the Fourth Angel.  
"真嗣关于你捉弄他的事还真没夸张。" 当东治回想起第三适格者在家中生活的那些故事时，他不禁汗颜。"会疼吗？" 东治的语气变得严肃起来，他想起了在与第四使徒战斗时，真嗣和健介进入插入栓与他并肩作战时，真嗣脸上写满的疲惫。

"Due to how the synchronization process works you'll feel everything the Eva feels. The higher the synchronization rate, the more responsive your Eva, but also the more connected to your nervous system and its pain receptors." Misato said with her arms crossed in her serious commander voice, letting Toji know honestly what was in store for him once they placed him in the entry plug after the Dummy Plug tests were complete.  
"由于同步过程的机制，你会感受到 EVA 所感受到的一切。同步率越高，你的 EVA 反应越灵敏，但同时你与神经系统及其痛觉感受器的连接也越紧密。" 美里交叉双臂，用她严肃的指挥官口吻说道，让东治清楚地知道一旦假插件测试完成后，他们将他放入插入栓时会面临什么。

"I think Rei knows I'm the pilot, but not Shinji or Asuka." Toji said as he remembered his rooftop conversation with Rei as his brooding did the impossible, killed his appetite.  
"我觉得丽知道我是驾驶员，但真嗣和明日香还不知道。" 东治回忆起与丽在屋顶上的对话，那次沉思让他不可思议地失去了食欲。

"You'll tell them when we get back to Tokyo-3?" Misato asked. She'd deliberately not told them Toji was the pilot, she'd worried it be too much for Asuka since she was suspended from piloting and what Shinji's reaction might be to a friend becoming an Eva pilot.  
"你会在我们回到第三新东京市时告诉他们吗？" 美里问道。她故意没有告诉他们东治是驾驶员，担心这对明日香来说太过沉重，因为她被停飞了，也担心真嗣对朋友成为 EVA 驾驶员会有什么反应。

"Yeah. I bet Sohryu will be pissed." Both of them shared a laugh as they imagined the German redhead fuming at the knowledge of Toji, of all people, being the Fourth Child.  
"是啊。我打赌惣流会气炸的。" 两人一起笑了起来，想象着那位德国红发少女得知东治，偏偏是东治，成为第四适格者时的愤怒模样。

"Dummy Plug inserted. Program loading." One of the faceless Matsushiro personnel relayed as remote controlled mechanisms placed the experimental technology in Unit-03. NERV was taking no chances. The entire testing area was fully automated with only a skeleton crew in hardened command and observation posts like the one they were in now.  
"插入模拟驾驶员。程序加载中。" 一位面无表情的松代工作人员报告道，远程控制的机械装置将实验性技术安装到三号机中。NERV 毫不冒险，整个测试区域完全自动化，只有少数人员在加固的指挥和观察哨所内，就像他们现在所在的这个。

"Begin initial activation." Dr. Ritsuko Akagi said as she leaned over one of her assistant's monitors to better glean the torrent of data they were receiving.  
"开始初始激活。" 赤木律子博士说着，俯身靠近一名助手的显示器，以便更好地解读他们接收到的海量数据。

"Power surge detected!" Someone shouted across the room.  
"检测到能量激增！" 房间里有人大声喊道。

"What's going on!" Misato asked frantically jumping to the observation window to get a better look at the situation.  
"发生了什么！" 美里焦急地跳到观察窗前，试图更清楚地了解情况。

"Cut the power immediately!" Ritsuko ordered jumping over to the central control station and swiping her ID card to open the emergency shutoff panel.  
“立即切断电源！”律子命令道，跳到中央控制台前，刷了 ID 卡打开紧急关闭面板。

"The failsafe already did but it isn't stopping!" An orderly anxiously said as Ritsuko repeatedly slammed the big red button to no avail.  
“安全机制已经启动了，但停不下来！”一名勤务兵焦虑地说，而律子不停地猛击那个大红按钮，却毫无效果。

"Brace!" Ritsuko ordered just as a bright light engulfed Unit-03 before spreading to the rest of the Matsushiro facility. The staff ducked under their stations while Toji tackled Misato to the floor away from the exposed position she was in, shielding her with his body as the shockwave hit the control center. As the light and shockwave passed an animalistic, primal roar echoed through the devastated facility as an obsidian black entity awoke and began striding towards its singular purpose.  
“抓紧！”律子刚下令，一道强光便吞没了三号机，随后扩散至整个松代基地。工作人员纷纷躲到工作台下，而真治则将美里扑倒在地，远离她原本暴露的位置，用自己的身体保护她免受冲击波的冲击。随着光芒和冲击波的消散，一个野性、原始的咆哮声在毁坏的设施中回荡，一个黑曜石般的黑色实体苏醒了，开始迈向它唯一的目标。

**Central Dogma: Ten minutes later  
中心法则：十分钟后**

"We've confirmed the Dummy Plug signal in Unit-03 but it is unresponsive to any commands." Lieutenant Hyuga said as Lieutenant Ibuki once again unsuccessfully tried to reestablish control over the errant Eva.  
“我们已经确认了 03 号机内的傀儡系统信号，但它对任何指令都没有反应。” 副官日向说道，与此同时，副官伊吹再次尝试重新控制这台失控的 EVA，但依旧未能成功。

"Evangelion Unit 03 will be abandoned at this time. It will be designated as the Thirteenth Angel." NERV Supreme Commander Gendo Ikari said coolly. His trademarked gloved hands steepled in front of his face hiding his emotions behind well-constructed walls.  
“此刻起，放弃对 03 号机的控制，将其指定为第十三使徒。” NERV 最高指挥官碇源堂冷冷地说道。他标志性的戴着手套的双手在面前交叠，隐藏在精心构筑的情感壁垒之后。

"Understood sir." Hyuga said as the Magi changed the designation and tried to establish orange or blue blood patterns for the newly minted angel.  
“明白，先生。”日向说道，这位魔术师更改了代号，试图为新诞生的天使建立橙色或蓝色的血液模式。

"Deploy Unit-00 to Mt. Nobe as planned." Commander Ikari said as he studied one of NERV's many contingency plans "Rei. Destroy the target." Gendo said, his tone warming slightly as he spoke the First Child's name.  
“按计划将零号机部署到野边山。”碇司令说道，他正在研究 NERV 众多应急计划中的一份，“绫波，摧毁目标。”碇源堂说道，提到第一适格者的名字时，他的语气稍稍温和了一些。

"Yes." Rei Ayanami responded from the entry plug of Unit-00.  
“是。”绫波零从零号机的插入栓内回应道。

Soon Unit-00 was deployed and positioned in an idyllic area of Japan's Post-Impact countryside that lay on the most direct route from Matsushiro to Tokyo-3. The lightly populated towns and farms having been hastily evacuated. The Eva-sized sniper rifle, well really an anti-material rifle but semantics and reality rarely see eye-to-eye, was aiming toward a gap in the mountains that JSSDF Reconnaissance identified as where the 13th Angel would enter the valley that was Rei's field of fire.  
不久，零号机被部署并定位在日本后冲击乡村的一个田园诗般区域，该区域位于从松代到第三新东京市的最直接路线上。人口稀少的城镇和农场已被匆忙疏散。EVA 尺寸的狙击步枪，实际上是一种反物质步枪，但语义和现实很少能达成一致，正瞄准着山脉间的一个缺口，JSSDF 侦察队识别出这是第 13 使徒将进入雷的射击范围的山谷入口。

Before long, murders of black crows cawed as they flew above the mountains in the afternoon sun disturbed by the approaching black mass. Trees snapped and splintered as Bardiel appeared walking into the open valley. Its black carapace of armor glinting in the sun as it was strewn with fleshy tendrils and mutations, mouth agape and arms at its side as it moved towards its destiny.  
不久，一群群黑乌鸦在午后阳光中飞越山脉，被逐渐逼近的黑色物体所惊扰，发出刺耳的叫声。随着巴迪尔出现在开阔的山谷中，树木断裂，碎片四溅。它那黑色装甲的外壳在阳光下闪烁，布满肉质的卷须和变异，嘴巴大张，手臂垂在两侧，向着它的命运前进。

The First Child activated her targeting system, the display moving down to in front of her face as she positioned the crosshair on the former Eva's black head.  
第一适格者激活了她的瞄准系统，显示屏移到她面前，她将十字准星对准了前 EVA 的黑色头部。

Rei breathed out, holding her breath as her finger pressed down on the trigger built into the Eva's controls and the neural connectors on her head sent her thoughts to the Eva, whose own trigger finger began to sympathetically depress. But rather than a bang ringing in her ears or the force of a recoil in her shoulder, Rei heard only a terrifying, gut wrenching "click".  
绫波深吸一口气，屏住呼吸，手指按下了插入栓控制台上的扳机，头部的神经连接器将她的思绪传递给 EVA，使其同步地开始按压扳机。然而，预想中的枪声和肩部的后坐力并未出现，取而代之的是一声令人心惊胆战的“咔嚓”。

It had misfired. A weapon that had taken nigh on a decade of development and collaboration from a half dozen of the world's leading arms manufacturers with a budget large enough to build an aircraft carrier had failed the one time it had been necessary to fire it in anger.  
它哑火了。这件武器历经近十年的研发，汇聚了全球半打顶尖军火制造商的智慧与合作，耗资足以建造一艘航空母舰，却在最关键的时刻——需要它愤怒开火的那一刻——失效了。

"Wha-!?" Rei began, her usually calm façade broken in the face of the unexpected. But it was too late. The click had given away her position to the Angel and the formerly plodding Bardiel had moved with speed worthy of the angel of lightning and jumped into the sky. With the sun behind it, even the Eva's sensors had trouble discerning its position in the heavens. Rei only barely managed to twist the sniper rifle in her arms and hold it like a staff to block the Thirteenth's strike. Its arms had elongated unnaturally in flight and using the force they offered the Angel twisted the rifle in Unit-00's hands, sending it flying when Rei couldn't keep a firm grip on it. The useless rifle spun three times before burying its muzzle in a nearby hill so the stock was pointed at an angle toward the sky.  
“什——？！” 绫波开始惊呼，她平日里冷静的外表在突如其来的变故面前破碎。但为时已晚。那声轻响已经暴露了她的位置，原本缓慢移动的巴迪尔此刻以堪比雷电天使的速度跃入空中。太阳在其背后，连 EVA 的传感器都难以在天空中分辨其位置。绫波勉强将狙击步枪扭转为杖状，以此抵挡第十三使徒的攻击。它的手臂在飞行中异常伸长，利用这股力量，使徒扭动步枪，当绫波无法紧握时，步枪被甩飞出去。无用的步枪旋转三圈后，枪口深深插入附近的小山，枪托斜指向天空。

Bardiel then grabbed the Eva's hands in its own and backflipped over Unit-00, so that Rei's Eva's arms were behind her and powerless. The Angel then forced the Eva to the ground, the thud sending vibrations for kilometers as metric tons of metal and cloned flesh fell down.  
随后，巴迪尔抓住 EVA 的双手，自身后空翻越过零号机，使得绫波的 EVA 双臂被反扣在背后，无力反抗。使徒随即迫使 EVA 倒地，那沉重的撞击声波及数公里，成吨的金属与克隆肉体轰然坠落。

Rei was helpless, her arms held in place and her legs thrashing uselessly. The angel then opened its mouth and putrid, dark, and viscous fluid that smelled of death and corruption poured onto Unit-00's hands, deforming them and causing the veins in both Rei's and Unit-00's arms to bulge in sympathetic agony at the onslaught.  
绫波无助地被困住，双臂被固定，双腿徒劳地挣扎。天使随即张开嘴，一股恶臭、黑暗且粘稠的液体，散发着死亡与腐烂的气息，倾泻在零号机的手上，使其变形，绫波和零号机的手臂静脉因这突如其来的痛苦而鼓胀。

"Mental Contamination spreading!" Aoba yelled as he looked at his monitors at the worrying state of the Eva.  
“精神污染扩散中！”青叶喊道，他盯着监控屏幕上令人担忧的 EVA 状态。

"Sever the arms." Gendo Ikari commanded laconically.  
“切断手臂。”碇源堂简短地下令。

"But sir she's still connected it woul-" Maya Ibuki began objecting to the order she'd been given.  
"但先生，她仍然连接着，这会——" 真希波·真理·伊吹开始反对她被下达的命令。

"Do it!" Commander Ikari repeated firmly allowing for no debate.  
"执行！" 碇司令重复道，语气坚定，不容辩驳。

Explosives positioned at the base of Unit-00's arms detonated, sending indescribable pain into Rei's mind as she curled into a fetal position in the entry plug and filled it with excruciating cries that would make anyone wonder how she could ever be called a doll. Mercifully the Angel seemed to grow tired of its foe now that it couldn't fight back and moved on.  
放置在零号机手臂底部的炸药引爆了，剧烈的疼痛涌入绫波的意识，她蜷缩在插入栓中，发出撕心裂肺的哭喊，这声音足以让人怀疑她怎么会被称作人偶。值得庆幸的是，天使似乎对无法还手的敌人失去了兴趣，继续前进。

"Instruct UN Secondary Forces to delay the Angel and keep it in the Mt. Nobe area." Gendo ordered calmly, mouth behind his hands, seemingly unphased by the fate of Rei.  
"命令联合国次级部队延缓使徒行动，将其牵制在 Mt. Nobe 地区。" 碇司令平静地下达指令，双手掩口，似乎对绫波的命运无动于衷。

"Yes sir!" Lieutenant Aoba said as he opened a channel to the local JSSDF commanders.  
"是，长官！" 青叶中尉应声道，随即打开与当地自卫队指挥官的通讯频道。

"And prep Units 01 and 02 for immediate deployment via heavy air carrier." Supreme Commander Ikari ordered, his hands never moving.  
"并准备立即通过重型航空母舰部署 01 和 02 号机。" 碇最高指挥官命令道，双手始终未曾移动。

"But sir they're under a freeze order!" Lieutenant Hyuga not quite yelled as his monitor displayed ominous and brightly lit warning text regarding the named units that only Supreme Commander Ikari could override.  
"但先生，它们处于冻结命令之下！" 副官日向并没有完全大喊，他的显示屏上显示着关于这些单位的警告文字，只有最高指挥官碇源堂才能覆盖。

"They are all that remains that can stop the Angel." Gendo said with his trademark lack of emotion. Though this wasn't technically true. They _could,_ **perhaps**, _**theoretically**_, continuously drop N2 mines on the angel for the weeks it would take to repair Unit-00 to sortie again. But one only had to think about this option for a moment to realize the impracticality.  
"它们是唯一能阻止使徒的剩余力量。" 碇司令以他标志性的缺乏情感说道。虽然这并不完全正确。理论上，他们或许可以连续几周向使徒投掷 N2 地雷，直到修复零号机再次出击。但只需稍加思考，就能意识到这一方案的不切实际。

"But it could trigger a catastrophic reaction!" Maya Ibuki objected as the next leading scientific expert with Dr Akagi MIA.  
"但这可能引发灾难性的反应！" 作为目前首席科学专家，赤木律子失踪后的继任者，伊吹玛亚反对道。

"One Eva is clearly insufficient and the danger between activating one or both is insignificant. We are left only with the choice of certain or potential destruction, if we do not chose the latter the former will be chosen for us." Gendo said firmly and paused for a moment to let the weight of the implication sit in the minds of his subordinates before continuing "Now brief the pilots."  
"一台 EVA 显然是不够的，激活一台或两台之间的风险微乎其微。我们只剩下选择确定性毁灭或潜在毁灭的选项，如果我们不选择后者，前者将被强加给我们。" 碇司令坚定地说道，并暂停片刻，让这一含义在他的下属心中沉淀，然后继续道 "现在向驾驶员简报。"

**Less than an hour later  
不到一小时后**

"That's all the information we have!" Lieutenant Hyuga said through voice only comms into the entry plugs of Units-01 and 02. The units had been activated and placed onto the black flying wings without any incident and NERV personnel were hopefully optimistic this would continue.  
"这就是我们所有的信息了！" 中尉日向通过仅限语音的通讯设备向 01 和 02 号机插入栓内说道。这两台机体已被激活并安全放置在黑色飞行翼上，NERV 的工作人员满怀希望地乐观认为这一过程将继续顺利进行。

"_Wunderbar_." Asuka said chomping at the bit, happy to be piloting again.  
"太棒了。" 明日香迫不及待地说道，对于再次驾驶感到兴奋不已。

"UN Secondary Forces are ceasing their attacks now. Drop in ten seconds!" Hyuga relayed as the last artillery rounds impacted the ground around the 13th Angel. Now the JSSDF, along with limited supporting forces from the UN, had been engaged with Angels for a while. They had quickly, and painfully, learned that conventional weapons were ineffective in destroying an Angel. So their tactic, instead of the cliched line of tanks and missile launchers directly in the path of a rampaging kaiju was to preposition artillery batteries, which was easy since Angels only ever attacked Tokyo-3 for reasons which the upper echelons of the JSSDF had never been given a satisfactory answer. These batteries were used to bombard the Angel and try and draw its attention toward the threat, sometimes it worked, sometimes not, while tank battalions and VTOLs would use their maneuverability and the natural cover of Japan's mountainous terrain to attack the Angel from different angles. Hopefully drawing the Angel in different directions to either keep it moving around in circles in a particular area or at least attempt to delay the angel long enough for NERV to do something. This tactic usually keeps casualties to a bare minimum, important since the Third Angel alone had rendered combat ineffective close to thirty percent of the JSSDF's mechanized forces.  
"联合国辅助部队现已停止攻击。十秒后空降！" 日向报告道，最后一轮炮火在第 13 使徒周围落地。日本自卫队连同联合国有限支援部队，与使徒交战已有时日。他们迅速且痛苦地认识到，常规武器对摧毁使徒无效。因此，他们的战术不再是陈词滥调的坦克与导弹发射器直接阻挡狂暴巨兽，而是预设炮兵阵地——这相对容易，因为使徒只会攻击第三新东京市，至于原因，自卫队高层从未得到过满意的解释。这些炮兵阵地用于轰击使徒，试图吸引其注意力，有时奏效，有时不然；与此同时，坦克部队和垂直起降战机则利用机动性与日本多山地形的天然掩护，从不同角度攻击使徒。希望以此将使徒引向不同方向，要么使其在某区域内不断转圈，要么至少试图拖延足够时间，以便 NERV 采取行动。 这一策略通常能将伤亡降至最低，至关重要，因为仅第三使徒就已使近百分之三十的日本自卫队机械化部队丧失战斗力。

"Dropping!" Hyuga's voice filled the entry plugs as the clamps holding the Evas released and the red and purple biomechanical units wordlessly fell in unison. The Evas extending their legs in a flying kick reminiscent of their battle with the 7th Angel. The black-armored Angel looked up too late and the perfectly in-synch feet of Units 01 and 02 impacted with a crash against its exposed back. The 13th Angel's spine bent unnaturally as a cry of pain escaped its red-toothed mouth and the Eva units used Bardiel as a springboard to launch themselves spinning over the Angel to land in front of it.  
“下降！”日向的声音在插入栓内响起，固定 EVA 的夹具释放，红色与紫色的生物机械单位无声地同步坠落。EVA 们伸展双腿，以一记飞踢的姿态，让人回想起与第七使徒的战斗。身披黑色装甲的使徒抬头已晚，零一与零二号机同步无间的双脚猛烈撞击在其暴露的背部。第十三使徒的脊椎不自然地弯曲，痛苦的嘶吼从其红齿间逸出，EVA 单位利用巴迪尔作为跳板，旋转着越过使徒，稳稳落于其前方。

"Guess that synch training is still paying dividends." Asuka said remarking on their first strike as she brought her Eva into a defensive posture.  
“看来同步训练的成效依旧显著。”明日香评论着他们的首次攻击，同时将她的 EVA 摆出防御姿态。

"Yeah. Just be careful, you saw what it did to Rei." Shinji said as he remembered watching the battle feed from the ready rooms near the Eva cages as he and Asuka were on standby. Thankfully Rei's entry plug had been ejected and was in the process of being recovered.  
“是啊，小心点，你看到了它对绫波做了什么。”真嗣说道，他回忆起在 EVA 格纳库附近的待命室里观看战斗实况的情景，当时他和明日香正在待命。幸好绫波的插入栓被弹射出来，正在被回收中。

"Mobility is the key then." Asuka said tensing the muscles on her arms as a feral grin spread across her face.  
“那么，机动性是关键。”明日香说着，紧绷手臂肌肉，脸上露出一丝野性的笑容。

"Ladies first." Shinji uncharacteristically teased, maybe he was just happy that Asuka was back at piloting, as he pulled out the Eva's progressive knife and Asuka did the same. There hadn't been time to get any pallet rifles or other heavy weapons so these would have to be enough.  
“女士优先。”真嗣破天荒地打趣道，也许是因为明日香重新开始驾驶 EVA 让他感到高兴，他拔出了 EVA 的渐进刀，明日香也照做了。没有时间去拿任何弹匣步枪或其他重型武器，这些就足够了。

"Baka!" Asuka said over their open comm as her mind formulated an attack plan. She glanced over at the power display only to kick herself mentally as it read 9999.99 seconds since her Eva was drawing power from its recently acquired S2 organ. Old habits die hard.  
"笨蛋！" 明日香在他们开放的通讯频道中说道，同时她的脑海中正在制定攻击计划。她瞥了一眼能量显示，心里暗自咒骂，因为上面显示着 9999.99 秒，她的 Eva 正从最近获得的 S2 器官中汲取能量。旧习惯真是难以改掉。

"Engage the Angel." The voice of Gendo Ikari commanded across their comms. Clearly not willing to put up with the pilots usual banter when they were under Major Katsuragi's command.  
"攻击使徒。" 碇源堂的声音在他们通讯频道中命令道。显然，当他们处于葛城美里少校的指挥下时，他不愿意忍受飞行员们平时的闲聊。

"Let's see what these can do!" Asuka exclaimed as she commanded her unit to jump into the air above the Angel and stabbed her progressive knife into the left shoulder of the former Unit-03 before leaping away as the Angel roared in pain and frustration as its unnaturally extended arms caught only air in their grasp. The roar turned into a gurgle as Unit-01 used the opening and plunged its progressive knife into the distracted Angel's throat and bright red blood spewed out in a torrent, bathing the right side of the purple mech in speckles and spatters.  
"看看这些能做什么！" 明日香兴奋地喊道，她指挥她的机体跃向空中，越过使徒，将她的高频刀刺入前 03 号机左肩，然后跳开，使徒因疼痛和挫败而咆哮，它那异常延长的手臂只抓到了空气。咆哮变成了咕噜声，因为 01 号机利用这个机会，将高频刀刺入分心的使徒喉咙，鲜红的血液如洪流般喷涌而出，将紫色机体的右侧染上了斑斑点点。

Unit-02 took the opportunity to return to its stuck knife and twisted it in the Angel's shoulder, Asuka knowing precisely where the connecting tendons and fibers were, owing to her lifelong obsession with being an Eva pilot. The four eyed red mech pulled at Bardiel's left arm while cutting with its knife. The strain eventually separating the limb from the Angel with a satisfying snap and tearing sound reverberating in the green valley their battle was taking place in. Unit-02 flew back with its prize, Asuka desperately trying to maintain balance while the maimed Angel let out a wail of pain from its bloodstained maw.  
二号机趁机取回卡住的刀，在使徒肩部精准扭动，得益于明日香自幼对成为 EVA 驾驶员的执着，她深知连接肌腱与纤维的位置。四眼红色机体一边拉扯巴迪尔的左臂，一边用刀切割。最终，随着一声令人满意的断裂声和撕裂声在绿谷中回荡，那条手臂从使徒身上分离。二号机携战利品飞回，明日香竭力保持平衡，而受创的使徒则从染血的口中发出痛苦的哀嚎。

Wasting no time Shinji let go of the Angel's other arm he had been holding while Asuka was hacking away and leaving his own progressive knife in the Angel's neck he punched the angel with all the force he could manage, enough to cause several teeth to fly through the air. Sending the less obsidian and increasingly blood-red angel into the strike range of a recovered Unit-02 who used the Angel's own detached arm as a makeshift club to whack Bardiel's head, its cranium cracking at the force the S2 powered arms were able to deliver as Asuka let out a battle cry in the entry plug.  
毫不浪费时间，真嗣放开了他一直抓着的使徒的另一只手臂，同时将他的高振动粒子刀留在使徒的脖子上，用尽全力向使徒猛击，足以让几颗牙齿飞向空中。他将那颜色逐渐由黑曜石变为血红的使徒击向了恢复过来的零二号机的攻击范围，零二号机利用使徒自己断掉的手臂作为临时武器，猛击巴迪尔的头部，其颅骨在 S2 机关驱动的强力手臂作用下破裂，与此同时，明日香在插入栓中发出战斗的呐喊。

Reeling and its feet wobbly the thirteenth angel was forced to the ground by another punch from Unit-01, who then promptly straddled the Angel and wrapped its hands around its neck, strangling it while in the entry plug Shinji not quite growled as primal rage more than conscious thought guided his actions.  
第十三使徒摇摇晃晃，脚步不稳，被初号机再次一拳击倒在地，随后初号机迅速跨坐在使徒身上，双手紧紧掐住其脖子，而插入栓中的真嗣，虽然没有咆哮，但原始的愤怒超越了理智，主导了他的行动。

Asuka in Unit-02 discarded the arm and instead furiously kicked at the exposed head of the Angel, deforming it into a mangled mess of fractured metal and flesh. Under such an assault Bardiel had no chance. At the same moment, its neck snapped and skull gave in under the pressure, the formerly animated limbs, well the remaining ones, that had been thrashing about like an animal that knew this was the end, fell limp as the Angel breathed its last.  
二号机中的明日香舍弃了手臂，转而愤怒地猛踢天使暴露的头部，将其踢得支离破碎，金属与血肉扭曲成一团。在这样的攻击下，巴迪尔毫无胜算。与此同时，它的颈部断裂，头骨在压力下塌陷，那些原本像知道自己命数已尽的野兽般疯狂挥舞的肢体，如今只剩下残余的部分，也随着天使的最后一息而瘫软下来。

"So this is the power of an S2 organ?" Sub-commander Fuyutsuki said from behind Gendo with a mix of dread and wonderment. It had been spectacular, but also terrifying, to behold, like watching a furious thunderstorm in the distance. Most of the bridge crew had been gaping in awe at how Shinji's and Asuka's minds were seemingly linked together. Each knowing perfectly when to strike and when to distract the angel to make an opening for the other. Their Evas hadn't even suffered a scratch in the battle. A far cry from their first sortie together. Though none of the NERV personnel watching had any idea as the real reason _why_ Shinji and Asuka had fought so well together.  
“这就是 S2 机关的力量吗？”副指挥官冬月在碇源堂身后说道，语气中混杂着恐惧与惊叹。这一幕既壮观又令人恐惧，宛如远观一场狂暴的雷雨。大多数桥上人员都目瞪口呆地看着真嗣和明日香的心灵似乎紧密相连，彼此完美地把握着何时出击、何时分散天使注意力以制造机会。他们的 EVA 在战斗中甚至毫发无损，与他们首次共同出击时的情景大相径庭。然而，观看的 NERV 人员中无人知晓真嗣和明日香之所以能如此默契配合的真正原因。

"Let's be certain." Gendo said, as a small smile crept in under his hands at the result before him on Central Dogma's large screen.. "Remove and destroy the Dummy Plug and open the chest armor and terminate the core." Commander Ikari radioed over the Evas' communications.  
"让我们确认一下。" 碇司令说道，他的嘴角在中央教条区的大屏幕前浮现出一丝微笑。"移除并销毁傀儡插入栓，打开胸甲并终止核心。" 碇司令通过 EVA 的通讯系统下达指令。

"Understood." Asuka said as she lifted up Bardiel's carcass and with the four-eyed Eva's bare hands she began ripping out the protective armor that guarded the entry plug while Shinji retrieved his progressive knife from the snapped and slashed neck and began prying open the chest armor.  
"明白。" 明日香回应道，她举起 Bardiel 的尸体，用四眼 EVA 的赤手空拳开始撕扯保护插入栓的防护装甲，而真嗣则从断裂的颈部取回他的高振动粒子刀，开始撬开胸甲。

Asuka got her prize first, pulling out the long cylindrical tube and holding it in the Eva's hands.  
明日香率先得手，她抽出那根长圆柱形的管子，将其握在 EVA 的手中。

"What?" Asuka mouthed quietly as she managed to read _Rei_ along the side of the entry plug. Her moment's hesitation was interrupted by Commander Ikari:  
"什么？" 明日香轻声地做出这个口型，同时设法从插入栓侧面读懂绫波的表情。她片刻的犹豫被碇司令打断：

"Destroy it." Asuka heard in her entry plug and her hands twitched crushing the plug in Unit-02's hands. Just then Shinji opened up the chest armor to reveal a bright orb, like the core found on the other angels they had faced.  
"摧毁它。" 明日香在插入栓中听到指令，她的手不由自主地一紧，将二号机手中的插入栓捏碎。就在这时，真嗣打开了胸甲，露出一颗明亮的光球，就像他们之前面对的其他使徒所拥有的核心一样。

"Wha-What's this doing in an Eva?" Shinji asked pausing with his progressive knife above the core ready to strike.  
"这——这是怎么回事？" 真嗣问道，他手中的高振动粒子刀悬停在核心上方，准备刺下。

"A result of the Angelic mutation. Like the unnaturally elongated arms." Gendo said as his hands actually went down from in front of his face and rested on the desk in front of him. "As long as it exists the Angel is not truly dead and we are all in danger." Gendo added as Shinji still hesitated for a moment before finally plunging his progressive knife into the core, seemingly eliciting a shrieking sound from it.  
“这是天使变异的结果，就像那异常延长的手臂一样。”源渡说道，他的手从脸前放下，搁在了面前的桌子上。“只要这核心存在，天使就并未真正死去，我们所有人都处于危险之中。”源渡补充道。真嗣犹豫片刻后，终于将手中的高频振动刀刺入核心，似乎引发了一声尖锐的哀鸣。

'Do all Evas have a core like that?' Asuka wondered as the bright red orb dulled and blackened, not quite convinced it was solely the result of Angel corruption or mental contamination.  
“所有 EVA 都有这样的核心吗？”明日香疑惑地看着那颗明亮的红色球体变得暗淡无光，她不完全相信这只是天使污染或精神感染的结果。

'What is going on here?' Both she and Shinji thought as they stood over Bardiel's corpse and looked at the setting sun as the once empty battlefield now swarmed with NERV technicians, clean up personnel and JSSDF.  
“这里到底发生了什么？”她和真嗣站在巴迪尔的遗骸旁，望着夕阳，曾经空旷的战场现在挤满了 NERV 的技术人员、清理人员和日本自卫队。

**Conference Room: Later that same day  
会议室：同一天晚些时候**

"The first priority is defeating the Angels." Gendo stated calmly to the gathered group of old men in a dark room lit only by the colored shades of their chairs.  
“首要任务是击败使徒。”碇源堂平静地对聚集在昏暗房间里的一群老者说道，房间仅由他们椅子的彩色遮光罩照明。

"But you still countermanded a direct freeze order from this committee. You put all of our work at risk!" The old man in the blue shaded chair said in an angry tone, unconvinced by the Supreme Commander of NERV's terse answer.  
“但你仍然违抗了委员会的直接冻结命令。你把我们所有的工作都置于风险之中！”坐在蓝色遮光椅上的老者愤怒地说道，对 NERV 最高指挥官简短的回答并不信服。

"The fact remains the Evas were activated without incident and combat effective." Gendo answered the accusation with his traditional nonchalance and steepled hands.  
"事实是，Eva 机体无事启动并具备战斗效能。" 源堂以他一贯的冷漠态度回应指控，双手合十。

"I am unsure a man of your judgment belongs in that chair!" The blue shaded member continued, openly questioning Ikari's fitness as his emotions got the better of him.  
"我不确定像你这样判断力的人是否适合坐在那个位置上！" 那位蓝影成员继续说道，公开质疑碇的适任性，情绪失控。

"Enough!" Chairman Lorenz Keel intervened in the exchange before it became too heated to control "Ikari, we will allow the future use of Units 01 and 02 only when all other options have been exhausted." Chairman Keel said trying to keep the committee focused on the primary goal of winning the Angel War by whatever means necessary.  
"够了！" 主席洛伦兹·基尔介入对话，以防局势失控。"碇，我们只会在所有其他选项都用尽后，才允许使用 01 和 02 号机。" 基尔主席试图让委员会专注于通过任何必要手段赢得使徒战争的主要目标。

"Considering the damage to Unit-00 and the loss of Units 03 and 04, that is the case now." Gendo said, stating the reality they found themselves in.  
"考虑到零号机的损坏以及三号机和四号机的损失，目前情况确实如此。" 碇源堂说道，陈述了他们所面临的现实。

"So be it." Chairman Keel acknowledged as Gendo's unmoving projection faded away.  
"那就这样吧。" 基尔议长认可道，碇源堂不动声色的投影随之消失。

"He must have his own agenda!" The blue lit member nearly raged at the gathered committee.  
"他肯定有自己的议程！" 那位蓝光映照下的成员几乎对聚集的委员会怒吼道。

"Perhaps we could transfer one of the Units from Tokyo-3? Return Unit-02 to Germany so that he doesn't possess such power." The yellow lit member postulated.  
“或许我们可以从东京-3 调派一个单位？将二号机送回德国，以免他拥有如此强大的力量。”黄色灯光下的成员提议道。

"Removing units from Japan is foolish. If the spawn of Adam win then all is lost and our dream of Instrumentality turns to ash." The red lit member cautioned as such a move would leave only one operational Evangelion in Japan, and they had all seen Unit-01's early combat records to know how close those battles had been and how vital having multiple Eva Units was to their victories.  
“从日本撤走单位是愚蠢的。如果亚当的后裔获胜，那么一切都将化为乌有，我们关于人类补完计划的梦想也将化为灰烬。”红色灯光下的成员警告说，这样的举动将使日本仅剩一台可运作的 EVA，而他们都已经看过初号机早期的战斗记录，知道那些战斗有多么接近失败，以及拥有多台 EVA 对他们的胜利有多么关键。

"For now Gendo is our collaborator against the Angels. _**If**_ he has a scenario of his own in mind, it like ours must wait until the Angels are defeated." Lorenz Keel said. Remembering why they had placed Gendo in charge of NERV in the first place. He was the only associate in Japan who possessed the necessary scientific and organizational skill to do the task while also being aware of SEELE's true intentions and goals. For now they needed him, even if they had doubts about his commitment to their vision of Instrumentality.  
“目前，碇源堂是我们对抗使徒的合作伙伴。如果他有自己的计划，那么就像我们的一样，必须等到使徒被击败后才能实施。”洛伦兹·基尔说道。他记得当初为什么会选择碇源堂来负责 NERV。他是日本唯一一个既具备完成任务所需的科学和组织能力，又了解 SEELE 真正意图和目标的合作伙伴。目前他们需要他，即便他们对他在人类补完计划上的忠诚度有所怀疑。

"What is the status of Units 05 and 06?" The blue lit member asked, having calmed down from his earlier exchange with Ikari.  
"05 号和 06 号机的情况如何？" 蓝色亮起的成员问道，从与碇的先前争执中平静下来。

"Barely begun. We did not anticipate losing Units-03 and 04 so quickly." The green lit member said with sadness, reminiscing on what those debacles had cost his country, and him personally.  
"才刚刚开始。我们没料到会这么快失去 03 号和 04 号机。" 绿色亮起的成员带着悲伤说道，回忆起那些灾难给他的国家和个人带来的损失。

"Maybe we should just scrap them for parts to keep our present Eva force operational?" The red lit member suggested as a way he thought was best to ensure success which was still opaque and muddled. Though the Dead Sea Scrolls had offered useful insights into the nature of the Angels and Instrumentality, they were vaguely worded in the way of all religious texts, and gave more lists of alternatives and requirements rather than a play-by-play prophecy of the future and the form each Angel would take and the date of attack.  
"也许我们应该把它们拆解成零件，以维持现有 EVA 部队的运作？" 红色亮起的成员提议道，他认为这是确保仍模糊不清的成功之路的最佳方式。虽然《死海古卷》对使徒和人类补完计划的本性提供了有用的见解，但它们像所有宗教文本一样措辞含糊，提供了更多的替代方案和要求，而不是对未来和每个使徒的形式及攻击日期的逐场预言。

"A decision will wait until the tests with the Mass Production Units are completed." Chairman Keel said, holding off a decision until more information made the best path forward clear.  
"在质量量产机的测试完成之前，决策将暂缓。"基尔议长说道，推迟决定直到更多信息使得前进的最佳路径明朗化。

**Approximately the same time  
大约同一时间**

"Wha-…wher-…" A dazed Toji Suzuhara mumbled as he came to in a hospital bed, as the last rays of the setting sun pierced their way past the window blinds.  
"什-…哪-…" 碇真嗣迷迷糊糊地躺在医院床上，喃喃自语，夕阳的最后一缕光线穿透了窗帘的缝隙。

"Toji. You're awake!" A soft excited voice the basketball jock recognized said.  
“东治，你醒了！”一个柔和而兴奋的声音说道，篮球高手立刻认出了这个声音。

"Shinji?" He asked turning his head. "What happened?" Toji asked as he looked at a Shinji Ikari dressed in his school uniform, the only clothes he had back in his locker at NERV, sitting on a chair next to the bed.  
“真嗣？”他转过头问道，“发生了什么？”东治看着身穿校服的真嗣·碇坐在床边的椅子上，那是他在 NERV 储物柜里仅有的衣物。

"Unit-03 was infected by an angel so…"Shinji began leaving the rest unsaid but Toji could put the pieces together and understood the implications.  
“三号机被使徒感染了，所以……”真嗣开始讲述，没有说完剩下的部分，但东治能将碎片拼凑起来，理解其中的含义。

"Guess we won't be teammates then, since my Eva is gone." Toji said, trying his best to remain nonchalant about the whole thing. "Kensuke is going to be so upset when he finds out." Both Shinji and Toji shared a laugh at the expense of their mutual friend.  
"看来我们做不成队友了，我的 Eva 已经没了。" 冬二说道，尽力让自己显得对此事无所谓。"健介知道后肯定会很失望。" 真嗣和冬二都笑了起来，调侃着他们共同的朋友。

Just then the hospital door opened and let in a raucous redhead and shy girl with brown pigtails both dressed in their school uniforms.  
就在这时，医院门被推开，一个吵闹的红发女孩和一个扎着棕色双马尾的害羞女孩走了进来，两人都穿着校服。

"Stooge! You've got some explaining to do!" Asuka Langley Sohryu yelled as she entered the room.  
"笨蛋！你得好好解释一下！" 惣流·明日香·兰格雷一进门就大声嚷嚷道。

"Argghh.!" Toji said through clenched teeth as he tried to sit up only to be stopped by searing pain through his right arm.  
“啊！” 真嗣咬紧牙关，试图坐起身来，却被右臂传来的剧痛所阻。

"Careful Toji!" Hikari said as she rushed to the side of his bed and helped him lie gently back down on the soft mattress, "The doctors said you fractured your shoulder as you shielded Miss Misato from the blast." Hikari stated, explaining the source of the throbbing discomfort Toji was experiencing.  
“小心点，真嗣！” 明日香急忙冲到他的床边，帮助他轻轻躺回柔软的床垫上，“医生说你为了保护美里小姐，肩膀骨折了。” 明日香解释道，说明了真嗣正在经历的阵阵疼痛的来源。

"Is she okay? What about the others?" Toji asked through gritted teeth. His tone serious and his face hard set.  
“她还好吗？其他人呢？” 真嗣咬牙问道，语气严肃，面容紧绷。

"They're a bit banged up but they're all alive. Nothing that won't heal." Asuka said summarizing the preliminary medical reports she had seen from her entry plug as she was awaiting recovery. That was actually how she and Shinji had discovered Toji was the pilot as they saw his name while looking for an update on Misato. Legend says the cleanup personnel could hear Asuka's "EYYYY!" throughout the entire valley. As soon as they could both had gone back to headquarters for debriefing and to change. Afterwards Shinji had gone straight to the hospital that was treating the Matsushiro wounded, while Asuka had gone to get Hikari.  
"他们受了些伤，但都还活着，没什么大碍。" 明日香总结着她从插入栓里看到的初步医疗报告，当时她正在等待恢复。她和真嗣发现东治是驾驶员的过程其实挺巧合，他们在寻找美里更新消息时看到了东治的名字。传说清理人员在整个山谷都能听到明日香的"哎呀！"声。一有机会，两人就返回总部进行汇报和更换衣物。之后，真嗣直接去了治疗松代伤员的医院，而明日香则去接光。

"Thank you Toji." Shinji said gratefully.  
"谢谢你，东治。" 真嗣感激地说道。

"But the stupid administrator didn't want to let Hikari in to see you!" Asuka said her indignation clear in her voice.  
"但那个愚蠢的管理员不让光进来见你！" 明日香的声音中明显带着愤怒。

'That explains the yelling and German cursing I heard.' Shinji mused thinking back to the commotion he heard a few minutes prior.  
“这就解释了刚才我听到的叫喊和德语咒骂。”真嗣沉思着，回想几分钟前的骚动。

"If you had just asked nicely instead of threatening to find his address in the NERV database and step on his house during the next Angel attack…" Hikari said quietly, as Toji noticed that she still hadn't removed her hands from his side and shoulder after helping him lie back down after he overexerted his shoulder. He didn't say anything though. It was…nice…comfortable.  
“如果你不是一开始就威胁说要查出他在 NERV 数据库里的地址，并在下次使徒袭击时踩他家……” 光轻声说道，同时注意到在帮助他躺下后，她的手还一直没从他的腰侧和肩膀上移开。他没说什么，但这感觉……很好……很舒适。

"It worked didn't it!" Asuka said with her hands on her hips and very proud of herself. Just then the hospital door opened again and revealed a smiling ponytailed spy in the doorway.  
“这不奏效了吗！”明日香双手叉腰，颇为得意。就在这时，医院门再次打开，门口出现了一个扎着马尾、面带微笑的间谍。

"Hey kids. Good to see you're all alright." Ryoji Kaji said in greeting before delivering the news he had "Misato just woke up."  
"嘿，孩子们。很高兴看到你们都安然无恙。" 加持良治打招呼后，带来了他得到的消息，"美里刚刚醒了。"

Misato despite being shielded by Toji had suffered some internal hemorrhaging, as the blast had reopened old wounds from Antarctica and she had needed some minor surgery.  
尽管有真治的保护，美里还是遭受了一些内出血，因为爆炸重新撕裂了她在南极留下的旧伤，她需要进行一些小手术。

"That's great!" Shinji said, getting up from the chair and headed toward the door, followed closely by Asuka who turned around and said with a sly grin to her friend Hikari:  
"太好了！" 真嗣说着，从椅子上站起来，朝门口走去，紧随其后的是明日香，她转过身来，对她的朋友光子狡黠地一笑：

"Look after the stooge, if we find another Eva we might need him." She said as she closed the door, leaving the two of them together.  
"照顾好那个傻瓜，如果我们再找到一个 Eva，可能会需要他。" 她说着关上了门，留下他们两人独处。

"Asuka…" Hikari said quietly as she watched her friend go, only to be brought out of her ruminations by the feeling of something warm and soft on her hand. Only then did Hikari realize she was still touching Toji and that he had covered the hand resting on his shoulder with his own. She tried to pull it away as she embarrassedly said "Ah Toji I..!" But he kept it in place with a firm but not painful grip.  
"明日香……" 光轻声说道，目送着朋友离去，直到被一种温暖柔软的感觉拉回思绪。直到那时，光才意识到自己还触碰着东治，而他用自己覆盖在她搭在他肩膀的手上的手。她尴尬地试图抽回手，说道："啊，东治，我……！" 但他用坚定但不疼痛的握力保持住了。

"I…" Toji began quietly, stopping Hikari's protests before continuing, "I know how you feel." Toji said. The words made Hikari's heart stop. Despite appearances Toji was an observant person and had managed to pick up on Hikari's body language when they had gone to Rei's together. "…and I feel the sa-" Toji didn't manage to finish as Hikari threw caution to the wind and pressed her lips against Toji's. His mouth muffled in surprise but soon he closed his eyes and they both melted into each other's embrace. The kiss itself was nothing spectacular, neither used their tongue or moved their lips passionately in the way lovers do. But for a first kiss, it was catharsis, all their pent up emotions and longings were conveyed in a way words could never manage and Hikari absently understood why Asuka always had that dreamy look in her eyes when they talked about her and Ikari's relationship.  
“我……”冬二轻声开口，在光制止前继续说道，“我知道你的感受。”这句话让光的心跳骤停。尽管外表不显，冬二其实是个细心的人，他注意到了光和他们一起去丽那里时的肢体语言。“……我也一样——”冬二没能说完，因为光不顾一切地吻上了他的唇。他惊讶地张嘴，但很快闭上眼睛，两人沉浸在彼此的怀抱中。这个吻并不惊艳，他们没有用舌头，也没有像恋人那样热情地移动双唇。但对于初吻来说，这是种宣泄，所有积压的情感和渴望以言语无法表达的方式传递出来，光恍然明白为何明日香谈及她和真嗣的关系时总带着那种梦幻般的神情。

**Meanwhile 与此同时**

The trio of two Eva pilots and a spy made their way down the halls of the hospital, making their way past hurrying staff who were struggling with the influx of casualties from Matsushiro. Kaji led the way down the hall while Shinji and Asuka walked behind him. Asuka holding her hands behind her head in a relaxed manner as she walked absently stretching the muscles in her back that always ached after sitting in an entry plug, while Shinji kept his hands at his side.  
两位 EVA 驾驶员和一名间谍的三人组在医院的走廊上穿行，匆匆忙忙的医护人员正忙于应对来自松代的大量伤员。加持走在前面，真嗣和明日香紧随其后。明日香双手交叉放在脑后，悠闲地走着，不经意间伸展着背部那些在驾驶插入栓后总是酸痛的肌肉，而真嗣则双手垂在身侧。

'Usually Asuka is a bit more clingy. Maybe it's the seriousness of the situation? Or she's worried about Misato?' Kaji thought as they approached the room that Misato had been moved to.  
'通常明日香会更黏人一些。也许是情况的严重性？还是她在担心美里？' 加持想着，他们走近了美里被转移到的房间。

"This is it." The unshaven man said as he opened the door to reveal a purple haired woman sitting up on her hospital bed looking out the window at the fading sunset.  
“就是这里。”这位胡子拉碴的男人说着，打开了门，露出一位紫发女子坐在病床上，望着窗外渐渐消退的夕阳。

"Everyone's here!" Misato said happily as she turned her head and saw people who she truly cared about her and reciprocated the feeling.  
"大家都来了！" 美里开心地说道，她转过头，看到了那些她真心在乎并同样关心她的人。

"Misato!" Shinji exclaimed. He had read the medical reports and his logical mind knew she was fine, but the relief of confirming it with his own eyes was evident in his voice.  
"美里！" 真嗣惊呼。他读过医疗报告，理智上知道她没事，但亲眼确认的宽慰之情在他的声音中显而易见。

"Everything still in one piece?" The German redhead said trying to appear to be blasé but unable to remove the relieved smile from her face.  
"一切都完好无损吗？" 那位德国红发女子试图表现得漫不经心，却无法掩饰脸上的宽慰笑容。

"They say everything is fine, but they're keeping all the personnel involved overnight just to be sure." Misato said, relaying what the doctors had told her. "Listen…I…" Misato began wanting to tell them about Toji and explain why she hadn't told them.  
"他们说一切都好，但为了确保安全，所有相关人员都被留下来过夜。" 美里说道，转述了医生的话。"听着…我…" 美里开始想说关于冬二的事，解释为什么她之前没告诉他们。

"We know Misato." Shinji said before Misato could get the words out.  
"我们知道的，美里。" 真嗣在美里说出话之前就打断了她。

"Who is running this program if they decide him, of all people should be a pilot?" Asuka asked indignantly, though with some genuine interest as to just how Eva pilots were chosen. Both Misato and Kaji looked at each other nervously.  
"如果他们决定让他，偏偏是他成为驾驶员，那这个计划是谁在负责？" 明日香不满地问道，尽管她也确实对 EVA 驾驶员的选择方式感到好奇。美里和加持都紧张地对视了一眼。

"All the students in class 2-A are fourth-level candidates. I only just found out recently myself, it was to keep all the potential pilots in one place to increase humanity's chances of survival." Misato said staring at some very interesting part of the hospital room's wall as she told Shinji and Asuka what she had learned from Dr. Akagi.  
"2-A 班的所有学生都是四级候选人。我也是最近才知道的，这是为了把所有潜在的驾驶员集中在一起，以提高人类生存的机会。" 美里盯着医院房间的某个有趣部分，向真嗣和明日香讲述她从赤木博士那里了解到的情况。

"All our classmates are…" Shinji began trying to process the information he'd been given.  
"我们所有的同学都是……" 真嗣开始试图消化他所得到的信息。

"…Potential pilots." Asuka said finishing for him equally rendered speechless as the image of Hikari in a plugsuit and gravely injured flashed before her eyes. Her earlier smile gone.  
"……潜在的驾驶员。" 明日香接过话头，同样被震惊得说不出话来，脑海中闪过穿着插入栓服、身受重伤的光的形象，她之前的笑容消失了。

"I know this is a lot to process, but it's still confidential information." Misato said as her two wards looked at the floor, with brooding looks written on their faces.  
"我知道这很难消化，但这些信息仍然是机密的。" 美里说道，她的两个监护人看着地板，脸上写满了沉思。

"So don't go telling Kensuke his dream is closer than he thinks." Kaji said. His attempt to lighten the mood worked and they had a laugh at what they thought Kensuke's reaction would be if he knew he was a pilot candidate.  
"所以别告诉真希他，他的梦想比他想象的更近。" 加持说。他试图缓和气氛的努力奏效了，他们想象着如果真希知道自己是驾驶员候选人，他会作何反应，不禁笑了起来。

The two couples, though only half really knew it was a group of two couples, stayed in the hospital room as the sun faded behind the horizon. They discussed various things but chiefly their recent battle which Misato had been absent for. With Asuka recounting their victory against the Angel and even stating that "Baka-Shinji had been useful". Eventually the stars began to come out and a nurse politely informed them that visiting hours were over. Kaji went out with the nurse to discuss something with her.  
两对情侣，虽然只有一半人真正意识到这是两对情侣的组合，留在医院房间里，直到太阳落山。他们讨论了各种事情，但主要是他们最近的一场战斗，美里当时不在场。明日香讲述了他们战胜使徒的经历，甚至提到"笨蛋真嗣也有用处"。最终星星开始出现，一名护士礼貌地通知他们探访时间结束了。加持和护士一起出去，与她讨论了一些事情。

"Will you two be okay on your own for tonight?" Misato asked as Kaji continued his bargaining with the medical staff. She normally would have had Kaji or someone watch them, but there was something about the maturity both of them had had during the last half hour of conversation that made Misato think they could be left alone. And besides Misato knew Kaji really didn't want to leave her alone, and there was no one else she trusted who could watch the kids on short notice.  
"你们两个今晚自己能行吗？" 美里问道，同时加持还在与医护人员讨价还价。她通常会让加持或其他人看着他们，但过去半小时里他们展现出的成熟让美里觉得可以放心让他们独处。而且，美里知道加持其实并不想离开她，而她又没有其他可以临时信任的人来照顾孩子们。

"We've managed it before." Asuka said trying not to let her grin get too big as the stars aligned for her and Shinji.  
"我们以前也应付得来。" 明日香说，尽量不让自己的笑容太过明显，因为星星似乎正为她与真嗣排成一线。

**The Katsuragi Apartment: after dinner  
葛城公寓：晚餐后**

The night was now fully in swing and the moon and all the stars Tokyo-3's light pollution would allow had come out and were shining. Shinji was at the sink washing the dishes from the take out that they had gotten, while Asuka was lying on her stomach and looking up at the stars from the living room.  
夜幕已完全降临，月亮和东京-3 光污染允许的所有星星都已出现，闪烁着光芒。真嗣正在水槽边清洗他们点的外卖餐具，而明日香则趴在客厅里，抬头仰望星空。

'I wish we could go out on the veranda and sit together.' Asuka thought absently as she remembered the time after the 9th Angel Matarael when she had been sitting between Rei and Shinji. At the time she had preferred the lights of the city to the starlight, but now she wanted to see what Shinji saw in them. Rei had remarked on some philosophical thought about man's fear of the darkness. 'I hope she's okay.' Asuka thought genuinely. Rei hadn't been taken to the same hospital as the others and instead had been sent to the Geofront. Word was she was okay, but still.  
'真希望我们能去阳台上坐在一起。'明日香心不在焉地想着，回忆起第 9 使徒马特拉尔事件后，她曾坐在真嗣和绫波之间。那时她更喜欢城市的灯光而非星光，但现在她想看看真嗣眼中的星空之美。绫波曾提到过关于人类对黑暗恐惧的哲学思考。'希望她没事。'明日香真心地想。绫波没有被送到其他人所在的医院，而是被送往了 Geofront。听说她还好，但终究还是有些担心。

It was grating on both of them that they could only be themselves in this apartment when they were alone. They wanted to do things, go places, experience things together. But Asuka knew if they did questions would be asked and actions taken by NERV who had a stake in their existence. 'At the very least the sex would stop.' Asuka thought. She'd always wanted to be thought of as mature and sex is the most mature thing anyone can really do, but with Shinji it wasn't about being mature or relieving the teenage hormones it was about trusting someone enough for you to lay yourself bare before them with no walls or barriers and importantly for them to reciprocate. Sex without that emotional commitment and its reciprocation is just an exchange of bodily fluids. Transactional. 'What was it that weird apparition said, "Become one with each other" or some shit like that?' The German redhead thought back to that bizarre experience she had shared with Shinji.  
对他们两人来说，只有在独自待在这间公寓时，才能真正做回自己，这让他们感到无比煎熬。他们渴望一起做些事情，去些地方，共同体验生活。但明日香知道，一旦他们这么做，NERV 就会提出疑问并采取行动，毕竟他们的存在对 NERV 有着重要意义。'至少，性生活会停止。'明日香暗想。她一直希望被视为成熟的人，而性爱是任何人能做的最成熟的事，但对真嗣来说，这不仅仅是关于成熟或释放青春期的荷尔蒙，而是关于对某人足够信任，让你在他们面前毫无保留，没有隔阂，更重要的是，他们也能以同样的方式回应你。没有这种情感承诺及其相互回应的性爱，只不过是体液的交换。交易性的。'那个奇怪的幽灵说过什么来着，“与彼此合为一体”还是类似的鬼话？'德国红发少女回想起与真嗣共同经历的那次奇异体验。

Asuka's stargazing was interrupted by a hand on her back, she could feel the warmth and dampness of hands that hadn't been completely dried through the thin fabric of her orange tank top.  
明日香的观星被打断了，一只手搭在她的背上，她能感觉到那双手未完全擦干的温暖和潮湿透过她橙色背心的薄布料传来。

"Hey." Shinji Ikari said in greeting as he rubbed his hand up and down her back.  
"嘿。" 碇真嗣打着招呼，同时用手在她背上上下摩挲。

"Hey." Asuka returned the simple greeting as she moved from lying down to sitting up. Shinji moved his hand away from her back in response, but did it a bit too quickly and he winced in pain as his shoulders told him he was moving his arm too quickly for their liking.  
"嘿。" 明日香简单回应着，从躺着变为坐起。真嗣随之将手从她背上移开，但动作稍快，肩膀的疼痛让他不由得皱眉，似乎手臂移动得太快让它们不太高兴。

"You okay?" Asuka asked her voice warm and concerned as she reached out a hand to feel the part of her lover's body that was in pain.  
"你还好吗？" 明日香关切地问道，声音温暖而充满担忧，她伸出手去触摸爱人疼痛的部位。

"Yeah, just the muscles in my shoulders are always tense after being in an Eva." Shinji said as he slowly rotated his right arm to work through the discomfort.  
“是啊，每次驾驶 Eva 后，我的肩膀肌肉总是很紧张。” 真嗣一边说，一边缓缓转动右臂，试图缓解不适。

"You baka, always hiding how you truly feel behind your shell." Asuka said with one hand on Shinji's shoulder and the other caressing his cheek. They were better at being open with each other, but they were still humans, and humans are flawed.  
“你这个笨蛋，总是把真实的感受藏在壳里。” 明日香一手搭在真嗣的肩膀上，另一只手轻抚他的脸颊。他们虽然更擅长向彼此敞开心扉，但终究还是人，而人都是有缺陷的。

"I just didn't want you to worry, and besides…others got hurt worse today." Shinji said with a gloomy tone as he thought about the fact that Misato and Toji were still in the hospital along with countless others, so what right did he have to complain about an aching shoulder?  
“我只是不想让你担心，而且……今天还有其他人伤得更重。” 真嗣语气阴沉地说道，想到美里和冬二还在医院里，还有无数其他人，他觉得自己有什么资格抱怨肩膀的疼痛呢？

"Don't be dour. We beat an angel today, and no one died." Asuka said remarking on the incredible fact that all the Matsushiro staff survived, all the civilians had been successfully evacuated, and even the JSSDF had engaged the Angel without loss of life. "Now lie down."  
"别这么阴沉。我们今天打败了一个天使，而且没人丧命。" 明日香说道，提及了那个不可思议的事实：松代基地的所有人员都幸存下来，所有平民都成功疏散，甚至连自卫队都无伤亡地与使徒交战。"现在躺下。"

"What?" The perpetually perplexed baka asked in a tone worthy of his title.  
"什么？" 那个永远困惑的笨蛋用符合他称号的语气问道。

"I said lie down, on your stomach, and take off your shirt." Asuka said as her brain worked out a way to help Shinji overcome his aches and guilt. 'He's got such a good heart, but it's a double-edged sword, he cares so much it buries him in feelings of guilt and worthlessness.' The thought popped into Asuka's mind unbidden, before she stopped herself 'As if you're any better Sohryu'.'  
"我说躺下，趴着，然后把上衣脱掉。" 明日香说道，她的脑子正在想出一个帮助真嗣克服疼痛和内疚的方法。'他有一颗善良的心，但这把双刃剑，他太过关心他人，以至于被愧疚和自卑感淹没。' 这个念头不由自主地跳入明日香的脑海，随即她制止了自己，'说得好像你有多好似的，惣流。'"

By the time Asuka's mind had stopped its psychoanalysis Shinji had taken off his pink T-shirt and was lying face down on the carpet in the apartment's living room in nothing but his blue boxers.  
等到明日香的心理分析停止时，真嗣已经脱掉了他的粉色 T 恤，只穿着蓝色内裤，脸朝下躺在公寓客厅的地毯上。

She crossed her legs and sat next to his prone form. Her nimble fingers had ample strength despite how delicate they may have seemed. Asuka didn't do anything fancy or special, merely working her thumbs in circles to relieve the built up tension in Shinji's shoulder muscles and getting pleasant groans from Shinji that told her she was doing a good job.  
她交叉双腿，坐在他俯卧的身体旁边。她的手指虽然看起来纤细，却有着足够的力量。明日香并没有做任何花哨或特别的事情，只是用拇指画着圈，缓解真嗣肩部肌肉积累的紧张，从真嗣那里得到的愉悦呻吟告诉她，她做得很好。

Eventually though her own back told her it didn't like the angle it was stuck at leaning over Shinji and her thumbs also protested at the effort of continued massaging, so she leaned down and whispered into her lover's ear:  
然而，最终她自己的背部告诉她，不喜欢这个倾斜的角度，她的拇指也因为持续按摩而抗议，于是她俯下身，对着爱人的耳朵低语：

"I'm gonna try something." Asuka said quietly as she moved and sat on top of him like one would ride a horse, her buttocks resting on his thighs just below where his boxers ended.  
"我要试试看某个东西。" 明日香轻声说着，移动身体跨坐在他身上，就像骑马一样，臀部落在他大腿上，位置恰好在他的内裤边缘下方。

'What could she mean by that?' Shinji's mind began just before hearing fabric crumple on the carpet next to him. 'What the-' he thought as his eyes cracked open seeing some vaguely orangish mass in his peripheral vision. Then he felt two warm, fleshy orbs with hardened tips dragging themselves up and down his back. Shinji's eyelids shot open as his brain registered **exactly** what was lying next to his face and what was moving up and down his back.  
'她这话是什么意思？' 真嗣的思绪刚起，就听到旁边地毯上传来布料摩擦的声音。'搞什么——' 他想着，眼睛微微睁开，瞥见视野边缘有个模糊的橙色物体。接着，他感觉到两个温热的、肉质球体，顶端硬挺，在他的背上上下摩擦。真嗣的眼皮猛地睁开，他的大脑准确地识别出躺在他脸旁的是什么，以及在他背上移动的是什么。

"Asuka-?!" Shinji began somehow being caught off-guard for the millionth time by the German redhead despite knowing better than literally everyone alive or dead how much of a nymphomaniac she was.  
"明日香-?!" 真嗣开口道，尽管他比任何活着或死去的人更清楚这位德国红发女孩有多么的性欲旺盛，但他还是第无数次被她搞得措手不及。

"Shhh- _Leibling_." Asuka said softly as she nibbled on his left earlobe while pressing her chest firmly against his back, sending goosebumps up and down his arms and legs and all the spare blood his heart could muster to the rapidly expanding bulge between his legs.  
"嘘——亲爱的。" 明日香轻声说着，一边轻咬着他的左耳垂，一边将胸部紧紧贴在他的背上，让他全身起鸡皮疙瘩，血液都涌向了双腿间迅速膨胀的凸起。

Bereft of her orange tank top Asuka was left in just her not-quite-tan, not-quite-beige cloth short shorts. The soft material riding up as she continued to massage Shinji's back with her breasts. After one pass her ass stroked lightly against the head of Shinji's raging hard-on that was just poking out from the leg of his boxers. '_Jemandes Blut ist heiß_.' The German redhead thought playfully as she internally debated how much longer she should tease him. Although her inner-voice told her that street ran two ways and soon enough the cloth of her short shorts was beginning to dampen with her own desire.  
没有了橙色背心的遮挡，明日香只穿着她那不深不浅的布质短裤。随着她继续用胸部按摩真嗣的背部，柔软的布料向上卷起。一次按摩后，她的臀部轻轻擦过真嗣内裤边缘露出的勃起。'某人的血很热。' 这位德国红发女孩俏皮地想着，内心却在争论还要逗弄他多久。尽管她的内心声音告诉她，这条街是双向的，很快她自己的短裤也开始因欲望而湿润。

"Turn over for me." Asuka seductively cooed into his right ear, giving a playful bite to the cartilage before lifting herself off of her lover so he could follow her instructions.  
"为我翻个身。" 明日香在他右耳边诱惑地低语，俏皮地咬了一下耳软骨，然后从爱人身上起身，让他按照她的指示行动。

Shinji flipped over so that he lied on his back, in the meantime Asuka had gotten one of the nearby bean bag chairs so he could rest his head.  
真嗣翻了个身，仰面躺下，与此同时，明日香拿了一个附近的豆袋椅，好让他把头靠在上面。

The movement caused his cock to pop through the slit in his boxers and now his shaft was standing upright in all its glory.  
这一动作使得他的阴茎从内裤的开口处弹了出来，现在他的肉棒正雄赳赳地挺立着，尽显其雄伟。

Asuka purred seeing Shinji's cock. She reached for the hem of his boxers wanting to see the entirety of his manhood.  
明日香看到真嗣的阴茎，不禁发出了一声低吟。她伸手去拉他的内裤边缘，想要一睹他男性雄风的全部风采。

"Did someone get a little excited. You pervert." Asuka said mischievously though without malice as she pulled down Shinji's blue boxers past his ankles threw them over in the pile with her orange tank top. The motion caused her breasts to wiggle and shake so seductively that Shinji's cockhead began to glisten as his mind became clouded with lust. Asuka saw Shinji's glazed over eyes and his bulging cock "Is _**this**_ also aching from being stuck in that tight plug suit all day?" Asuka asked in her tender voice filled with temptation as she wrapped one hand around his shaft while the other ran the tips of her fingers across his balls sending a tingling sensation across his entire groin and Shinji's mouth felt sickeningly sweet as desire took over: "I've got a _**special**_ massage in mind for it." Asuka finished as she opened her lips wide and took Shinji's cockhead into her mouth.  
"有人是不是有点兴奋过头了？你这变态。" 明日香调皮地说道，语气中并无恶意，她将真嗣的蓝色内裤拉到脚踝处，扔进了那堆衣物中，与她的橙色背心混在一起。这一动作使得她的胸部摇曳生姿，如此诱人，以至于真嗣的龟头开始闪烁着光泽，他的思绪被欲望所笼罩。明日香注意到真嗣迷离的眼神和他勃起的阴茎，"这也是因为整天被困在那紧绷的插入栓服里而感到难受吗？" 她用充满诱惑的温柔声音问道，一只手环绕着他的阴茎，另一只手则用指尖轻抚他的睾丸，带来一阵阵酥麻感传遍他的整个腹股沟，真嗣的口中感到一种令人作呕的甜蜜，欲望占据了上风："我有个特别的按摩想为它准备。" 明日香说完，便张大了嘴，将真嗣的龟头含入口中。

Asuka started slowly taking only the tip of Shinji's member while her hand only lightly stroked his shaft as her head bobbed up and down. Though soon she went deeper taking first a third, then half, then almost all of Shinji's shaft into her mouth and throat with each bobbing of her head up and down. The sounds of Asuka's slurping filled the living room as she built up more and more saliva in her mouth and the fluid escaped through the gaps between her lips and his shaft coating it in a thin sheen while larger drops made their way to his sack. The combined feeling of Asuka's fingers and the tingling chill of the saliva on his balls caused them to rapidly contract as they readied their load to be fired and Shinji had to consciously hold back cumming to soon, he wanted to enjoy the sensation for as long as he could.  
明日香开始缓慢地只含住真嗣的阴茎尖端，同时她的手轻轻抚摸着他的阴茎，头上下摆动。但很快她便深入起来，先是三分之一，然后是一半，接着几乎将真嗣的整个阴茎吞入她的口中和喉咙，随着她头部的每一次上下摆动。明日香的吸吮声充斥着客厅，她口中分泌的唾液越来越多，液体从她的唇与阴茎间的缝隙中溢出，形成一层薄薄的膜，而更大的水滴则滴落到他的阴囊上。明日香手指的触感和阴囊上唾液带来的微凉刺痛感，使得它们迅速紧缩，准备释放精华，而真嗣不得不有意识地克制自己，以免过早射精，他想要尽可能长时间地享受这种感觉。

Asuka feeling that Shinji was close to his release stopped her sucking and moved her face next Shinji's cock to look up at his eyes while her hand continued to stroke his cock and she moved her hips up so that her ass was high enough so Shinji could see it wiggling invitingly behind her. The German redhead however hadn't realized just how close her Japanese lover was. The combination of the sight before him and the sensation on his cock was too much.  
察觉到真嗣即将释放，明日香停止了吮吸，将脸移到真嗣的阴茎旁，抬头凝视着他的眼睛，同时手继续抚弄着他的阴茎，并抬起臀部，使得她的臀部抬高，让真嗣能清楚地看到她那诱人扭动的臀部。然而，这位德国红发少女并未意识到她的日本恋人已经多么接近极限。眼前的景象与下体传来的感觉交织在一起，对他来说太过强烈。

"Asu-" He began far too late as his balls unleashed themselves and several strong spurts of Shinji's seed shot forth. Some caused white streaks to appear across Asuka's red hair while others landed on the left half of her face, mostly leaving strands of viscous semen on Asuka's cheek and forehead.  
“明日——”他开始得太迟了，随着他的睾丸释放，几股强劲的真嗣的精液喷涌而出。一些在明日香的红发上留下了白色的痕迹，而另一些则落在她的左半边脸上，大部分粘稠的精液留在了明日香的脸颊和额头上。

Neither of them moved as the cum slowly began to stop dripping down Asuka's face and while it didn't solidify, it had spread enough to where gravity exerted less control.  
两人都没有动，随着精液慢慢停止从明日香脸上滴落，虽然它没有凝固，但已经扩散到重力对其影响较小的程度。

Finally Asuka made the first move and stood up, Shinji was about to mouth a frantic apology when he saw Asuka hands reach for the hem of her short shorts. As she pulled them down and cast them aside Shinji managed to, somehow despite his status as a baka, notice that a dark splotch covered the most private area on the discarded shorts.  
终于，明日香率先行动，站起身来，真嗣正要慌忙道歉，却见明日香的手伸向了她的短裤边缘。当她脱下短裤并将其丢到一旁时，真嗣不知怎的，尽管他是个笨蛋，却注意到了那被丢弃的短裤上覆盖着私密处的一块深色污渍。

Now when Asuka had gotten up from the living room floor Shinji had also moved to a more sitting position in the yellowish beanbag chair instead of simply lying his head against it. In all the silence and even after releasing a sizeable load Shinji's cock hadn't softened and evidently hadn't satisfied its lust. The ravenous redhead now pushed Shinji further down into the puffy chair as she mounted him.  
如今，当明日香从客厅地板上起身时，真嗣也调整了姿势，坐进了那张黄色的懒人沙发，而不是仅仅将头靠在上面。在一片寂静中，即便释放了大量欲望，真嗣的阴茎并未软化，显然并未满足其欲望。这位饥渴的红发少女现在将真嗣进一步推入蓬松的沙发中，跨坐在他身上。

Shinji felt as Asuka grabbed his cock in her hands and placed it frantically and wordlessly at her opening, more animalistic than he had ever seen her before. He felt as his cockhead penetrated into her, open air being replaced with warm, wet, fleshy constraint. Asuka lowered herself fully onto Shinji's cock and started moving her hips so she was riding him as her hands made their way to his chest and shoulders. The living room filled with the strange combination of Styrofoam beads smashing together and the impacts of their hips.  
真嗣感觉到明日香用手抓住他的阴茎，急切而无声地将其对准她的入口，比他以往见过的任何时候都更显得野性。他感受到龟头进入她体内，原本的空气被温暖、湿润、紧致的肉体所取代。明日香完全坐下，将真嗣的阴茎纳入自己体内，开始扭动臀部，骑乘着他，双手则移到他的胸膛和肩膀上。客厅里充满了奇怪的混合声响，既有泡沫塑料珠碰撞的声音，也有他们臀部撞击的声响。

Shinji looked up into his lover's eyes some deeply buried part of his conscious thinking brain knew that she should be furious with him. Meanwhile in Asuka's own mind she herself had the same thought but she wanted him, and she wasn't about to let the baka doing baka-things get in the way of what she wanted or her name wasn't Asuka Langley Sohryu.  
真嗣抬头望进爱人的眼睛，他潜意识深处的一部分理智知道，她本应对他怒不可遏。而在明日香的心中，她也同样有此念头，但她渴望他，绝不会让这个笨蛋的笨拙行为妨碍她想要的东西，否则她就不叫惣流·明日香·兰格雷。

Once Shinji was sure that Asuka wasn't going to murder him in the immediate future he put his hands up to her waist so he could guide her as she rode him. Shinji felt sheer bliss as he looked up and saw her cum-covered face above her bouncing breasts, the brownish nipples pointing toward the sky before coming back down with every thrusting motion she made onto his cock looking for release.  
当碇真嗣确信明日香不会在近期内谋杀他时，他双手环抱她的腰际，以便在她骑乘他时引导她。真嗣抬头望去，只见她那沾满精液的脸庞，伴随着她跳动的双乳，棕色的乳头指向天空，随后随着她每一次对准他的肉棒寻求释放的冲击动作而回落。

Shinji felt her wetness surround his cock and drops even flowed down his shaft, onto his balls and from there created a stained wet spot on the bean bag that was serving as the location of today's tryst. Asuka angled her hips and gyrated her waist as she kept finding new sweet spots for his rock-hard member in her pussy. Not much more.  
真嗣感受到她的湿润包围着他的肉棒，甚至有水滴顺着他的阴茎流下，滴到他的睾丸上，在那里形成了一个湿润的污渍，就在今天幽会的豆袋上。明日香调整着她的臀部角度，扭动着腰肢，不断在她湿润的私处寻找着他坚硬肉棒的新快感点。仅此而已。

Asuka felt the fire build up in her belly and she bit her lower lip in an attempt to prevent a moan from escaping but had limited success. Shinji squeezed her waist tighter in response and Asuka's muted moans added themselves to the orchestra of their love-making. After a few more frantic gyrations of her hips Shinji felt Asuka's walls tighten and close around him and her body shake in his hands as Asuka crested into her orgasm. The German redhead collapsed onto his chest, panting and shaking at the intensity of her orgasm. Her red hair strewn about them, covering the both of them.  
明日香感到腹中的火焰逐渐升腾，她咬紧下唇试图阻止呻吟逸出，但成效有限。真嗣回应地更紧地搂住她的腰，明日香压抑的呻吟声加入了他们爱欲交织的乐章。她的臀部又急促地扭动了几下，真嗣感觉到明日香的体内紧缩并环绕着他，她的身体在他手中颤抖，明日香达到了高潮的顶峰。这位德国红发少女瘫倒在他的胸膛上，喘息着，因高潮的强烈而颤抖。她的红色发丝散落四周，覆盖着两人。

Shinji waited for Asuka to calm down before exiting her. But Asuka noticed something strange, usually there was a warmness inside her the feeling adding to and strangely soothing the inferno of her insides. Then the realization hit her:  
真嗣等待明日香平静下来后才退出。但明日香察觉到了一丝异样，通常她体内会有一股温暖的感觉，这种感觉会增添并奇妙地平息她内心的火焰。然后她意识到：

'He didn't cum.' “他没有射精。”

Between the load on her face and the alacrity with which she had cum riding him, Shinji, to put it bluntly hadn't had time to reload.  
她脸上的疲惫和刚才骑在他身上高潮时的敏捷，直白地说，真嗣还没来得及再次准备。

"I want you to finish." The redhead said grabbing his still hard member in her hand as he tried to get up from underneath her and she brought her head from where it had been next to his so she could look into his eyes. They were like that for just a moment but it may as well have been an eternity.  
"我要你完成。" 红发女孩说着，抓住他依然坚挺的下体，阻止他试图从她身下起身，同时将头从他旁边抬起，以便直视他的眼睛。那一刻，他们的目光交汇，仿佛时间凝固，成了永恒。

"Flip over for me then." He said cheekily as he nodded echoing her words from earlier.  
"那就为我翻个身吧。" 他俏皮地说道，点头回应她先前的话。

'Baka, I'm already on my stomach and bent over.' Asuka thought as she positioned herself on the bean bag so her ass was up and he knelt down behind her. Shinji wetted the tip of his cock before placing it at her opening, Asuka seemed to dry up preternaturally fast after she came and he didn't want to cause her discomfort. He pushed his moistened member into Asuka's pussy and began to slowly and rhythmically stroke his cock into her as his hands grabbed the creamy white skin of her ample ass.  
“笨蛋，我已经趴下并弯腰了。”明日香一边想着，一边在豆袋上调整姿势，让臀部翘起，而他则跪在她身后。真嗣先湿润了阴茎的顶端，然后将其对准她的入口，明日香似乎在高潮后异常迅速地干燥，他不想让她感到不适。他将自己的湿润之物缓缓插入明日香的私处，开始有节奏地抽插，同时双手抚摸着她丰满臀部那奶油般的白皙肌肤。

This position always made the penetration feel deeper. Soon her pussy instead of being tight had moistened and loosened again as her body's instincts took over and with each thrust Shinji was hilting himself fully into her and her ass was bouncing and shaking at the impacts.  
这个姿势总是让插入感觉更深。很快，她的私处不再紧绷，而是再次湿润并放松，身体的本能接管了一切，随着每一次挺进，真嗣都深深地插入她体内，她的臀部在撞击下弹跳摇晃。

She looked back at him, the sight of her face, still partially covered in his seed and Asuka biting her lip caused Shinji to thrust even harder into her. Her walls seemed to suck in and caress his cock with each stroke and Asuka could see the pleasure on his face as she looked into his eyes and failed again to stop a moan escaping her lips as her face buried itself in the beanbag. As Asuka's muffled moans filled his ears he felt the pressure build in his balls and he knew he was close. Meanwhile Asuka felt another fire build inside her and silently hoped Shinji would last long enough to bring her over the edge again. Eventually she felt the Shinji's thrusts become more erratic, more forceful, and she knew he was about to cum.  
她回头望向他，脸上仍残留着他的种子，而明日香咬着嘴唇的模样让真嗣更加用力地挺进她体内。她的内壁仿佛在每一次抽插中吮吸并抚慰着他的肉棒，明日香凝视着他的双眼，却再次未能抑制住唇边逸出的呻吟，她的脸深埋在豆袋中。随着明日香压抑的呻吟声充斥耳畔，真嗣感到下体压力逐渐累积，他知道自己即将爆发。与此同时，明日香体内又燃起一股欲望之火，她默默祈祷真嗣能持久到再次将她推向高潮。最终，她感受到真嗣的冲刺变得愈发无序、愈发猛烈，她明白他即将射精。

His instinct was to thrust his cock as deep as possible into her as he came, a relic of the evolutionary desire to breed and pass on your genes, but as it happened his shaft was only about a third of the way inside her when he came. Ropey cum impacted her walls and pooled near her entrance, only held in her pussy by the dam that was Shinji's cockhead, which was quickly extracted. The cum poured out of her pussy and onto first Asuka's clitoris and then the bean bag underneath her. Shinji saw Asuka shake again as the warm sticky fluid flowing over her most sensitive nub brought her over the edge for the second time that hour.  
他的本能驱使他在高潮时将阴茎尽可能深地插入她体内，这是进化中繁殖和传递基因的欲望遗留，但事实上，当他射精时，他的阴茎只插入了她体内大约三分之一。粗壮的精液冲击着她的内壁，在她入口附近积聚，仅被真嗣的龟头形成的堤坝所阻挡，很快就被抽出。精液从她的阴道流出，先是落在明日香的阴蒂上，然后是下面的豆袋上。真嗣看到明日香再次颤抖，温暖的粘稠液体流过她最敏感的部位，让她在一个小时内第二次达到了高潮。

After they calmed down again Asuka went to clean herself up before joining Shinji on the couch, Asuka placing her head on Shinji's chest while he gently stroked her arm and absently played with the locks of her fiery hair. They laid there simply enjoying each other's presence and letting contentment wash over them.  
他们再次平静下来后，明日香先去清洗自己，然后回到沙发上与真嗣坐在一起，明日香将头靠在真嗣的胸前，而他则温柔地抚摸着她的手臂，漫不经心地玩弄着她火红的头发。他们就这样静静地享受着彼此的存在，让满足感涌遍全身。

But while reality can be postponed it can never be halted entirely and Asuka eventually broke the silence with something that had been bothering her:  
然而，现实虽然可以推迟，却永远无法完全停止，明日香最终打破了沉默，提起了困扰她的事情：

"The dummy plug had Rei's name on it." The German redhead said without looking at her lover's face as she recounted the sight from earlier today.  
“那个备用插入栓上写着零的名字。”德国红发少女没有看向她的恋人，只是回忆着今天早些时候看到的情景说道。

"Why?" Shinji asked his face covered in a puzzled look as he brought a finger to her chin and guided her head so they were face to face as they talked.  
“为什么？”真嗣满脸疑惑地问道，同时用手指托起她的下巴，引导她的头转向自己，以便面对面交谈。

"Well maybe they're using her as a template. The plug is supposed to allow an Eva to operate remotely. I just can't understand why her, she has the lowest synch score." Asuka said trying to make sense of what she saw, it having only added more questions to the seemingly endless list they had with all the weird things they had seen in the past several months.  
“也许他们是以她为模板制作的。这个插入栓本应允许 EVA 远程操作。我只是不明白为什么是她，她的同步率可是最低的。”明日香试图理清思绪，但这一发现只是给过去几个月里他们遇到的种种怪事增添了更多疑问。

"Maybe they're just going in order, she is the First Child after all, and she's been with NERV the longest so maybe they have more data on her." Shinji said offering a somewhat plausible explanation, though Asuka wasn't convinced. She'd been a pilot for the vast majority of her life and her obsession with being the best had given her the synch-test lead for most of that time so greater ubiquity of data didn't seem a likely to her.  
“也许他们只是按顺序来，毕竟她是初号机驾驶员，而且她在 NERV 的时间最长，所以可能关于她的数据更多。”真嗣提出了一种看似合理的解释，但明日香并不信服。她几乎一生都在担任驾驶员，对成为最佳的执着让她在大部分时间里都保持着同步测试的领先，因此数据更普遍这一点对她来说并不太可能。

"That still doesn't explain why we both felt our mothers in the Evas. Or why the Angel wanted to know about us." Asuka remarked, recalling their surreal experience with the 12th Angel having them relieve the inflection points of their relationship and their mothers' presence.  
“这仍然无法解释为什么我们都在 EVA 中感受到了我们的母亲。或者为什么使徒想要了解我们。”明日香评论道，回忆起他们与第 12 使徒的奇异经历，让他们重温了彼此关系的关键时刻以及他们母亲的在场。

"We need help on this." Shinji said shaking his head. His face covered in a serious look and his hand clenched and unclenched as the gears in his mind turned. Asuka squeezed the edges of the couch cushions in her hands already knowing the words he would say next: "We need to talk to Misato."  
“我们需要帮助。”真嗣摇着头说。他的脸上布满了严肃的表情，手紧握又松开，脑海中的思绪在转动。明日香紧握着沙发垫的边缘，已经知道他接下来要说的话：“我们需要和美里谈谈。”

**A/N:** I am not fully happy with this chapter but deadlines are deadlines. Let me know how it turned out.  
作者注：我对这一章并不完全满意，但截止日期就是截止日期。请告诉我效果如何。

So yeah this battle was a beatdown since Bardiel is one of the weakest Angels in my opinion, only defeating Rei due to her unnatural hesitation in the series and beating Asuka solely due to distraction and still losing to a dummy plug Unit-01 despite being in a superior position. So naturally two S2 equipped Units with pilots that don't hesitate are going to beat it in under a minute. Though I had to do a bit of a hand wave with Unit-00 in order to make a situation where they'd be needed. Next chapter will be Zeruel, and that's going to be…interesting.  
所以，这场战斗确实是一边倒的，因为在我看来，巴迪尔是其中最弱的天使之一，仅因丽在系列中的不自然犹豫而击败了她，并完全因分心而战胜了明日香，尽管处于优势地位，却仍被模拟插入栓的零一击败。因此，两名装备 S2 引擎且毫不犹豫的驾驶员驾驶的机体自然会在一分钟内击败它。不过，为了让需要他们的情境成立，我不得不对零零号机进行一些手法上的处理。下一章将是塞鲁，那将会……很有趣。

This is definitely more plot heavy but that's because there are a lot of threads that need expanding on and the narrative needs to move forward.  
这一章确实更侧重于剧情，这是因为有许多线索需要展开，叙事也需要向前推进。

Also the observant among you may recognize the seed I planted in this chapter. I said this would be less traumatic but not free of it.  
同样，那些观察敏锐的读者可能会发现我在这一章埋下的种子。我说过这会少些创伤，但并非完全没有。

Also Also the only Lemon going forward will be AXS, so all of you MXK and HXT will have to find something else.  
另外，今后唯一的柠檬将是 AXS，所以所有 MXK 和 HXT 的粉丝们需要另寻他处了。

As always let me know what you think. Are the battles good, is the story proceeding coherently, is there enough lemon? All that fun stuff and thanks for reading.  
一如既往，请告诉我你们的想法。战斗精彩吗？故事进展是否连贯？柠檬够不够？所有那些有趣的事情，感谢你们的阅读。

### Chapter 8 A Couple's Battle

Asuka Langley Sohryu, Second Child and pilot of a four-eyed biomechanical behemoth as bright as her hair, lay in bathtub in the apartment currently only inhabited by her and a somehow alcoholic penguin. The warm water relaxing muscles, that between gym classes at school and NERV's seemingly endless barrage of training, were sorely in need of a respite.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷，二号适格者兼四眼生体兵器驾驶员，其机体的明亮程度不亚于她的发色，此刻正躺在公寓的浴缸中，这里目前只有她和一只不知怎的成了酒鬼的企鹅居住。温暖的水流舒缓着肌肉，这些肌肉在学校健身房课程和 NERV 似乎永无止境的训练中，迫切需要一个喘息之机。

Though that wasn't the real reason Asuka had drawn a bath, filled it with suds, lit a lavender-scented candle, or three, and essentially shut herself off from the world.  
尽管这并非明日香放满泡沫、点燃薰衣草香氛蜡烛（还一连点了三根），并实质上将自己与外界隔绝的真正原因。

It wasn't her muscles that needed a break, it was her mind.  
需要休息的不是她的肌肉，而是她的心。

She and Shinji had decided shortly after the last Angel attack they needed to talk to Misato Katsurgai, their sometimes guardian, about their mothers' presence and the 12th Angel's seeming fascination with their relationship, in the hope that if they pooled their information insights could be found. The decision may have been made but she…just… wasn't ready to tell Misato. Not that the NERV major, between being in the hospital, the cleanup related to the 13th Angel, and being back together with Kaji, had been around a lot for them to tell her even if they had wanted to.  
她和真嗣在最后一次使徒袭击后不久就决定，他们需要与他们时而的监护人葛城美里谈谈关于他们母亲的存在以及第 12 使徒对他们关系的明显迷恋，希望如果他们汇集信息，就能找到一些见解。虽然决定已经做出，但她……只是……还没准备好告诉美里。并不是说 NERV 的少校，在医院里、与第 13 使徒相关的清理工作以及与加持重新在一起之间，有很多时间在他们身边，即使他们想告诉她。

In the meantime her mind had had plenty of time to go over the million possibilities of how the conversation could go and the potential outcomes filling her with anxiety, and her worry over the future paralyzing her in the present moment.  
与此同时，她的脑海里有足够的时间去思考这场对话可能发生的百万种可能性以及潜在的结果，这些让她充满了焦虑，对未来的担忧让她在当下动弹不得。

"Hah, so is this how the baka felt?" Asuka said to the empty bathroom with closed eyes and a pain-hiding grin on her face. Though part of that smile was genuine as her mind turned to the comforting image of her roommate, comrade, and lover all in one.  
“哈，这就是那个笨蛋的感觉吗？”明日香对着空无一人的浴室闭着眼睛说道，脸上带着掩饰痛苦的笑容。虽然那笑容的一部分是真心的，因为她的脑海中浮现出室友、战友和爱人的安慰形象。

Misato being essentially gone the past week or so, the days kind of blurred together for Asuka, hadn't been all bad. The sex had been absolutely amazing for one. But more than that it was just being able to live together without any hiding or subterfuge.  
过去这一周左右，美里基本上不在，对明日香来说，日子虽然有些模糊，但并不全是坏事。至少那场性爱绝对令人惊叹。更重要的是，能够一起生活，无需任何隐瞒或伪装。

The grin on the German redhead's face turned into a full smile as her mind thought back to this morning:  
德国红发少女的嘴角上扬，变成一个灿烂的笑容，她的思绪回到了今早：

_The rays of morning sun shone through the window in Asuka's room. The pilot opened her eyes, her right cheek felt warm as it rested on still-sleeping Shinji's chest, and judging from the lack of purple headed woman yelling at them about responsibility or some such Misato hadn't come home last night. Last night.  
晨曦的阳光透过明日香房间的窗户洒进来。驾驶员睁开眼睛，她的右脸颊感到温暖，因为它正贴在仍在熟睡的真嗣胸口上，而且从没有紫发女子对他们大喊大叫关于责任之类的事情来看，美里昨晚并没有回家。昨晚。_

_Passionate embraces, kisses, euphoria she hadn't thought possible. Asuka closed her eyes, taking in the moment, Shinji's arm around her as she rested her head above his beating heart, her arms wrapped around his chest.  
激情四溢的拥抱，亲吻，那种她未曾想象过的狂喜。明日香闭上眼睛，沉浸在这一刻，真嗣的手臂环绕着她，她将头靠在他跳动的心口，双臂环抱着他的胸膛。_

_Some time later, Shinji's eyes fluttered open, taking in the previously unfamiliar ceiling before looking down to see Asuka's eyes looking up at him, a childish but genuine smile on her face.  
过了一会儿，真嗣的眼睑轻轻颤动，睁开眼，打量着之前陌生的天花板，然后低头看到明日香的眼睛正仰望着他，脸上挂着孩子气却真挚的微笑。_

"_Good morning sleepy head." Asuka said to Shinji as her hand went to his nose and gave it a gentle flick._  
“早安，小懒虫。”明日香对真嗣说道，她的手伸向他的鼻子，轻轻地弹了一下。

"_Good morning Asuka." Shinji said as he gave her a gentle squeeze on the shoulder. "How'd you sleep?" He asked as his cobalt eyes peered deep into her cerulean orbs as the light reflected off her bright hair in the early hour._  
“早上好，明日香。” 真嗣说着，轻轻捏了捏她的肩膀。“睡得怎么样？” 他问道，深邃的蓝眼睛凝视着她碧蓝的眸子，晨光在她的亮发上闪烁。

"_Like a baby." Asuka said as she lifted her head up from his chest to give him a peck on the lips._  
“像个婴儿一样。” 明日香说着，从他的胸口抬起头，轻轻在他唇上吻了一下。

"_What do you want for breakfast?" Shinji asked his lover as he rubbed his hand up and down her arm from the shoulder to elbow and back again._  
“早餐想吃什么？” 真嗣问他的爱人，手在她手臂上从肩膀到肘部来回抚摸。

"_Do we have any of that bacon left" Asuka said as she remembered the sweet and salty flavor the applewood smoke gives to bacon._  
"我们还有那种培根吗？" 明日香说道，她想起了苹果木烟熏培根那甜中带咸的味道。

"_About half a pack." Shinji said as his eyes looked up at the ceiling while his brain did a quick mental check of what was left in the fridge and pantry. Mostly beer._  
"大概还有半包。" 真嗣说道，他的眼睛望向天花板，大脑迅速地在脑海中检查冰箱和食品储藏室里还剩下什么。基本上都是啤酒。

"_Yum. Oh and can you make that special a…thing… where the egg is in the toast?" Asuka said as she blanked on the Japanese word for that particular breakfast dish._  
"好吃。哦，对了，你能做那个特别的……东西……就是鸡蛋在吐司里的那种吗？" 明日香说道，她一时想不起那个特定早餐菜肴的日语单词。

"_You mean Cyclops toast?" Shinji responded with the correct word._  
"你是说独眼巨人吐司？" 真嗣用正确的词回应道。

"_Yeah that's the one." Asuka said as she snuggled her face into the space between Shinji's neck and shoulder and moved her leg on top of Shinji to embrace him. She stopped her movements though as her leg felt something. "How? Seriously how after last night does he still want_ _**more?!**__" Asuka asked perplexedly as she felt Shinji's stiff morning wood against her thigh._  
"对，就是那个。" 明日香说着，将脸埋进真嗣颈肩之间的空隙，并把腿搭在真嗣身上拥抱他。但她的动作突然停了下来，因为她感觉到腿上有什么东西。"怎么可能？昨晚之后他还想要更多？" 明日香困惑地问道，她感觉到真嗣晨勃的坚挺抵在自己的大腿上。

"_It's just psychological! You took Anatomy in college didn't you!" Shinji blurted out as he tried to defend himself._  
"这只是心理作用！你大学不是学过解剖学吗！" 真嗣脱口而出，试图为自己辩解。

"_Physiological not psychological baka." Asuka corrected her baka-Shinji, "And yes I did." She said matter-of-factly before removing her hands from his body and continuing "In that class they said that if a man" Asuka put special emphasis on that last word as she looked at Shinji seductively as she climbed on top of him. "Has an erection and it doesn't get_ _**used**__, the blood returning to his body can be very painful later." She said now fully on top of Shinji, her hips pressing his erect member against his body and her breasts squeezed against his chest "And I don't want my sweet baka to be in pain." She whispered in her most teasing voice into Shinji's ear._  
"“生理上的，不是心理上的，笨蛋。”明日香纠正了她的笨蛋真嗣，“没错，我是这么做了。”她实事求是地说道，然后从他身上移开双手，继续说：“在那堂课上，他们说如果一个男人”明日香特别强调了最后一个词，同时挑逗地看着真嗣，爬到他身上。“有了勃起却没有得到释放，血液回流到身体时可能会非常痛苦。”她现在完全压在真嗣身上，臀部将他勃起的部位紧贴在他身体上，双乳挤压着他的胸膛，“我不想让我的甜心笨蛋受苦。”她用最挑逗的语气在真嗣耳边低语。

_Her hand gripped the blanket that covered most of their bodies and tossed it away with dramatic flair, the fabric strewn about at the foot of the bed and the floor leaving just their nude bodies atop the bed.  
她抓住覆盖在他们身体大部分的毯子，以戏剧性的动作将其甩开，毯子散落在床尾和地板上，只留下他们赤裸的身体躺在床上。_

_Asuka brought her right hand's fingers up to her mouth and put them in, withdrawing them in a seductive manner that left a tiny string or two of saliva between her mouth and fingers. After that she brought her fingers down and moistened the lips of her labia, opening up and exciting the pink and brown fleshy folds while her left hand grabbed hold of Shinji's morning wood. It was thick and veiny with the hot, excited blood rushing through it. She wetted the bulging cockhead with her almost soaked lower lips as her own body got excited at the imminent prospect of sex.  
明日香将右手的手指抬至嘴边，轻轻含入，随后以一种诱人的姿态抽出，留下一两丝唾液在唇间与指尖之间。接着，她将手指下移，湿润了自己的阴唇，展开并刺激着粉褐色的肉褶，同时左手握住了真嗣晨起的勃起。那根肉棒粗壮且青筋凸起，热血沸腾，兴奋不已。她用几乎湿润的下唇湿润了鼓胀的龟头，自己的身体也因为即将到来的性事而兴奋起来。_

The memory was so good that Asuka's hand slipped under the water and went between her legs almost on reflex. Her fingers massaging the folds and clit of her most private place.  
那记忆如此美好，以至于明日香的手不由自主地滑入水中，伸向双腿之间。她的手指按摩着最私密处的褶皱和阴蒂。

_Once she thought his cockhead was wet enough and her own insides were ready she lowered herself onto Shinji's thick member. The cock spreading the petals of her sex as it penetrated deeper into her, sending electrifying energy through her as Shinji's member struck all the right nubs and folds before he became hilted into her and she felt that feeling of fullness as she settled on his cock and gave her pussy some time to adjust before she started moving.  
一旦她觉得他的龟头足够湿润，而自己的体内也已准备就绪，她便缓缓坐下，将真嗣粗壮的肉棒纳入体内。那根肉棒撑开她私处的花瓣，深深地刺入，带来一阵阵电击般的快感，随着真嗣的肉棒触碰到所有敏感的突起和褶皱，直至完全没入，她感受到了那种充实的满足感，稳稳地坐在他的肉棒上，让她的蜜穴有时间适应，然后再开始移动。_

_She started slowly at first, only gently moving her hips so that the walls of her pussy softly stroked his shaft. But that didn't last long, her blood was up, the inferno of desire building in her belly as her hormones told her mind that she_ _**had**_ _to satisfy her lusts. So she put her hands on his surprisingly firm chest to brace herself, while at the same time Shinji moved one hand to her hips, ostensibly to help guide her movements, but really just to grab her ass while his other hand went up to her breasts. Massaging and kneading them, lightly pinching and exciting her nipples as she rode him._  
起初，她动作缓慢，只是轻轻地扭动臀部，让蜜穴的壁肉温柔地摩擦他的肉棒。但这并未持续太久，她的血液沸腾，欲望的火焰在腹中燃烧，荷尔蒙告诉她的大脑，必须满足自己的欲望。于是她将双手放在他出乎意料结实的胸膛上以支撑自己，与此同时，真嗣的一只手移到她的臀部，表面上是为了引导她的动作，实际上只是趁机捏住她的屁股，而另一只手则伸向她的乳房，揉捏着，轻掐着，刺激着她的乳头，随着她在他身上起伏。

_In the meantime she had built up a steady rhythm as she guided Shinji's rock-hard member to all the places she needed in her warm, wet, pussy to scratch that itch. Between all of the stimulation her body was receiving from Shinji's cock and hands she first had her breath start hitching then she felt a moan building up, so she bit her lip to keep it in check. But it was a losing battle and soon a deep moan filled her bedroom as she guided Shinji's shaft to a particular sensitive fold inside her and she gritted her teeth to try and wrestle back conscious control of her body.  
与此同时，她已建立起稳定的节奏，引导着真嗣坚硬如石的阳具在她温暖湿润的蜜穴中，触及那些急需抚慰的敏感点。在真嗣的肉棒与双手带来的全方位刺激下，她先是呼吸开始急促，接着一阵呻吟在喉间酝酿，她咬住唇试图压抑，却徒劳无功。不久，一声深沉的呻吟在卧室内回荡，当她引领真嗣的肉棒触碰到体内某个特别敏感的皱褶时，她紧咬牙关，试图夺回对身体意识的掌控。_

_Coming out of this she looked at Shinji's face and saw his eyes glazed over at the sight before him so she leaned down, pressing her body against his and kissed him. Their kiss was strong and passionate as their tongues battled for supremacy and Shinji brought the hand that had been on her breasts to her face his thumb lightly stroking her cheek in contrast to the firm grip of his other on her ass. Asuka kept up the pace of her hips and as she felt her own walls tightening around it she reached her lithe hand behind her and felt Shinji's balls. The feeling of her touch on his sack sent lightning through Shinji's body and he seemed to shiver in response and momentarily paused his kissing, overwhelmed by the sensation.  
她从这番情景中回过神来，看向真嗣的脸，发现他的眼神因眼前的景象而变得迷离，于是她俯下身，紧贴着他的身体，吻了上去。他们的吻热烈而激情，舌尖交缠争夺主导，真嗣将原本放在她胸前的手移至她的脸颊，拇指轻柔地抚摸着她的脸庞，与另一只手在她臀部上的坚定抓握形成鲜明对比。明日香保持着臀部的节奏，当她感受到自己体内的紧缩时，她纤细的手伸到背后，触摸到了真嗣的睾丸。她的触碰如同电流般贯穿真嗣的身体，他似乎因此颤抖了一下，暂时停下了亲吻，被这感觉所征服。_

'_Oh you liked that did you?' Her mind thought as her fingers danced again on the wrinkles of his balls. They had already retreated and tightened against his body so she knew that he was close like she was. She gave one last effort, bouncing her hips up and down as fast as she could, not quite tickling but not quite massaging his rocks, and pushing her tongue as far as possible into his mouth. And it worked. She soon felt herself crest as her walls tightened fully around his cock and her body was overcome by uncontrollable shakes as the orgasm washed over her. The moan she let out at that moment was too much for Shinji and he also reached his climax as his balls released their pent up load into her waiting pussy. Three or four spurts of the warm, sticky, white substance impacted her walls filling her with a sense of fullness and completeness in the afterglow._  
“哦，你喜欢那样是吗？”她的心思在脑海中闪过，手指再次在皱褶的睾丸上舞动。它们已经缩回并紧贴着他的身体，所以她知道他就像她一样接近高潮。她做最后一次努力，尽可能快地上下摆动臀部，既不是轻挠也不是按摩他的岩石，同时尽可能深地将舌头伸入他的口中。这奏效了。她很快感觉到自己达到了高潮，她的阴道壁紧紧包裹着他的阴茎，身体被无法控制的颤抖所征服，高潮如潮水般席卷而来。那一刻她发出的呻吟声对真嗣来说太过强烈，他也达到了高潮，他的睾丸释放出积聚已久的精液，射入她等待已久的阴道。三四次温暖的、粘稠的、白色的精液冲击着她的阴道壁，让她在余韵中感受到一种充实和完整。

_She looked down at his face and as he stroked her cheek with his hand he said the words she loved:  
她低头看着他的脸，他用手指轻抚她的脸颊，说出了她最爱的话：_

"_Asuka…"_ "明日香…"

"…Asuka?" The German redhead was pulled out of her pleasant memory of Shinji Ikari by the real Shinji Ikari standing in the bathroom looking at her with that quizzical look his face was known for.  
“…明日香？”德国红发女孩被现实中的真嗣·碇从对真嗣·碇的美好回忆中拉了出来，他站在浴室里，脸上带着那副众所周知的困惑表情看着她。

Asuka reflexively crossed her arms and covered her exposed breasts, the tepid bathwater sloshing and splashing with her movements as she began to berate his intrusion into her solitude:  
明日香本能地交叉双臂，遮住裸露的胸部，随着她的动作，微温的浴水随之晃动溅出，她开始责备他闯入她的独处时光：

"Baka why didn't you knock!" She said indignantly, the smile on her face turning into a scowl as she regarded Shinji in the way she would have before their conversation at Mt. Asama.  
“笨蛋，你为什么不敲门！”她愤愤地说道，脸上的笑容转为皱眉，以他们在榛名山谈话之前的态度看待真嗣。

"I did Asuka. Three times." Shinji said, his measured response wiping away the glare on her face as he continued "You didn't answer, I was worried and I decided to check on you." He looked down his hand going to the back of his head "So-"  
“我敲了，明日香。敲了三次。”真嗣平静的回答消解了她脸上的怒意，他继续说道，“你没有回应，我担心你，所以决定来看看。”他低头看向自己的手，摸向后脑勺，“所以——”

"No it's alright, I WAS pretty out of it." Asuka said, pre-empting Shinji's habitual apology. Her voice softened and relaxed as her arms left her chest and rested on the side of the bathtub. Her brownish nipples, still hardened and pointed from her earlier excitement, midway into the water. "Did you find everything at the store?" She asked trying to change the subject.  
“不，没事，我那时确实有点恍惚。”明日香说道，抢在真嗣习惯性道歉之前。她的声音柔和放松，双臂从胸前放下，搭在浴缸边上。她那因先前兴奋而依然坚挺的棕色乳头，半浸在水中。“你在店里找到所有东西了吗？”她试图转移话题问道。

"Yeah but the price" Shinji cringed as he remembered how his wallet wailed "Those sausages you like are double what they were last time." He said by way of example.  
“找到了，但价格……”真嗣皱眉，想起钱包的哀嚎，“你喜欢的那些香肠，价格是上次的两倍。”他举例说道。

"Yikes." Asuka winced herself. "Did you at least find my Strawberry shower gel at Kaguya's?"  
“哎呀。”明日香也皱了皱眉，“你至少在 Kaguya's 找到我的草莓沐浴露了吗？”

"No, they didn't have it all. Sorry." Shinji said contritely.  
"不，他们并没有拥有一切。抱歉。" 真嗣愧疚地说道。

Asuka vaguely understood why. And how it was her and Shinji's fault in a roundabout way. Even before Second Impact Japan had been an expensive place to live and most food, and, well everything, was imported. The Japanese Government had spent most of the time since that disaster securing its vital import lines with what ships that had survived, and had even managed to stabilize the situation. Until the Angels came. Then the limited shipping capacity had to account for a surge of Eva spare parts, shells and missiles for Tokyo-3s defenses, supplies for the UN Secondary Forces and a whole host of other vital materials. And even with absolute global priority and starving most of the rest of the Pacific Basin of cargo space there simply wasn't enough room on the ships for everything. So the price of unnecessary things like Asuka's sausages and shower gel skyrocketed, or simply never arrived.  
明日香隐约明白其中的原因。以及这在某种迂回的方式上，是她和真嗣的错。甚至在第二次冲击之前，日本就是一个生活成本高昂的地方，大多数食物，以及，嗯，所有东西，都是进口的。日本政府在灾难发生后的大部分时间里，都在确保那些幸存的船只能维持其重要的进口线路，甚至设法稳定了局势。直到使徒出现。然后，有限的航运能力不得不应对 EVA 备件、东京-3 防御系统的炮弹和导弹、联合国次级部队的补给以及其他一系列重要物资的激增。即使在全球范围内享有绝对优先权，并让太平洋流域的大部分地区缺乏货物空间，船上仍然没有足够的空间容纳所有东西。因此，像明日香的香肠和沐浴露这样非必需品的价格飙升，或者干脆从未到达。

"That sucks, I'm down to my last bottle." Asuka lamented and looked at where the half-empty bottle stood on its shelf with the other lotions and balms.  
"这太糟糕了，我只剩下最后一瓶了。" 明日香哀叹道，目光投向了那半空瓶子所在的其他乳液和药膏的架子。

"Are you sure you're okay Asuka?" Shinji said sitting down on the edge of the bathtub and taking Asuka's hand in his.  
"碇君，你确定你没事吗，明日香？" 真嗣坐在浴缸边上，握住了明日香的手。

She knew what Shinji meant, she had barely eaten the breakfast she'd asked Shinji for and now she'd somehow not heard him come home, put away all the groceries, knock on the bathroom door three times and come in. She also knew why. After that high this morning she had been overcome by the dreadful, nauseating thought it could be the last time, hence her seclusion in the bath to calm herself, and thinking back on the pleasant memory instead.  
她明白真嗣的意思，她几乎没吃下自己让真嗣准备的早餐，而现在她竟然没听到他回家的声音，把所有杂货都放好，敲了三次浴室门然后进来。她也知道原因。今早那股兴奋过后，她被一个可怕的、令人作呕的念头击垮了，那就是这可能是最后一次了，因此她躲进浴缸里试图平复心情，转而回忆起那段美好的记忆。

"Yeah." The German redhead said halfheartedly. Not looking at Shinji but instead some very interesting soap suds floating in the bath.  
"嗯。" 这位德国红发少女半心半意地回答，没有看向真嗣，而是盯着浴缸里漂浮的非常有趣的肥皂泡。

"You're worried about what will happen with Misato." Shinji said. It wasn't a question it was a statement.  
"你在担心美里的事情。" 真嗣说道。这不是一个疑问，而是一个陈述。

"I've forgotten how good you've gotten at reading me." Asuka said actually looking up at him and seeing a calm reassuring smile on his face.  
"我已经忘了你有多擅长读懂我了。" 明日香说着，真的抬头看向他，看到他脸上平静而令人安心的微笑。

"Worst case scenario is they forbid us from being together until we're eighteen, then they can't tell us anything anymore. Or maybe even sixteen if we both get emancipated, I doubt either of our fathers would really care and sign it just to be rid of us." Shinji blurted out, clearly having thought of it himself and rehearsed this plan, though his voice still became bitter when talking about their fathers.  
"最坏的情况是他们禁止我们在一起，直到我们十八岁，那时他们就无法再对我们说什么了。或者甚至可能是十六岁，如果我们俩都获得解放，我怀疑我们的父亲真的会在乎，只是为了摆脱我们而签字。" 真嗣脱口而出，显然他自己已经考虑过这个计划并进行了演练，尽管在谈到他们的父亲时，他的声音仍然变得苦涩。

"That's not helping baka." Asuka said more melancholic than angry. "It's still so far away and who knows what tomorrow will bring."  
"那根本没用，笨蛋。" 明日香带着比愤怒更深的忧郁说道，"还那么遥远，谁知道明天会带来什么。"

"Whatever it does bring, I'll still love you." Shinji reassured Asuka as he squeezed her left hand in both of his.  
"无论明天带来什么，我依然会爱你。" 真嗣安慰着明日香，同时用双手紧握住她的左手。"

"Baka." Asuka said still unconvinced if the tone of her voice was anything to go by. "Hand me a towel." She said resignedly.  
"笨蛋。" 明日香的声音中仍透露出不确信，"递条毛巾给我。" 她无奈地说道。"

"Sure." Shinji said as he reached to the side of the bath where they were. Only for his hand to be engulfed in searing, burning pain causing his arm to recoil as Asuka's warning came too late.  
“当然。” 真嗣说着伸手去拿浴缸边的东西，结果手被滚烫的灼热感吞噬，剧痛让他猛地缩回手臂，而明日香的警告已经太迟了。

"Sto-!" Asuka had tried to warn as Shinji's hand went directly over one of the lavender candles she had lit earlier. "Are you okay?" She asked Shinji as she stood up in the tub, the water sloshing around violently, as she went to the corner of the bath covered in plastic bottles and picked up some ointment as her mind raced:  
“小——” 明日香试图警告，但真嗣的手已经直接伸向了她之前点燃的薰衣草蜡烛。“你还好吗？” 她站在浴缸里问道，水花四溅，她急忙走到浴缸角落堆满塑料瓶的地方，拿起一些药膏，心中焦急：

'Was that my fault? Sure the baka didn't look but I'm the one that lit the candle.' Asuka thought sounding much more like Shinji than she probably realized as she poured the ointment on her hands and then onto the burned hand of her lover. A spot of skin was a bit more pink than usual, nothing serious but still.  
‘是我的错吗？虽然这个笨蛋没看清楚，但是我点的蜡烛。’ 明日香心想，语气听起来比她可能意识到的更像真嗣。她将药膏倒在手上，然后涂在恋人烧伤的手上。有一小块皮肤比平时更红，虽然不严重，但依然需要注意。

"Thank you Asuka, I should really be more attentive." Shinji said as he felt the cold gel move over his skin. But Asuka didn't respond right away she was still deep in her own mind:  
"谢谢你，明日香，我真该更细心些。" 真嗣说着，感受到冰凉的凝胶在皮肤上移动。但明日香没有立即回应，她仍沉浸在自己的思绪中：

'Life, love, people, they are all like that candle, that flame.' Asuka thought as she pondered the duality of joy and pain that is the human condition. 'The light and warmth may make you happy, but the flames can also burn you. Even if they don't want to. How can something that can give joy also give pain?'  
'生命、爱情、人们，都像那支蜡烛，那簇火焰。' 明日香思索着人类境遇中快乐与痛苦的双重性，'光明和温暖或许让你快乐，但火焰也能灼伤你。即便它们并非有意。为何能带来喜悦的事物也会带来痛苦？'

"Let's call Misato Shinji." Asuka said as she stopped rubbing the soothing balm on Shinji's hand without looking up into his eyes as her thoughts brought her to a decision. Asuka felt the tremor in his hand her request caused before his mouth could open and answer.  
"我们叫美里小姐吧，真嗣。" 明日香说着，停止了在真嗣手上涂抹舒缓药膏的动作，没有抬头看他的眼睛，她的思绪让她做出了决定。明日香感觉到他的手因她的请求而颤抖，在他开口回答之前。

"Really? Are you sure?" Shinji said taking hold of her hands, more for his sake than hers as Asuka brought her head up and they stared into each other's eyes searching for certitude. He saw the fire of the German redhead's certainty gleaming in her eyes but still wanting to hear the words leave her lips. Asuka sighed and looked back down at her knees, poking above the water's surface, before answering:  
"真的吗？你确定？" 真嗣说着握住她的手，更多是为了自己而非她，因为明日香抬起头，两人凝视着对方的眼睛，寻找着确定性。他看到了德国红发女孩眼中的坚定之火，但仍渴望听到她亲口说出这些话。明日香叹了口气，低头看着水面上的膝盖，然后回答道：

"We've got to do this if we want to see tomorrow, something isn't right, and we can't just ignore it. But we can't deal with it on our own." Asuka said deciding that they should take the path that leads to hope, even if it may be lined with pain.  
"如果我们想看到明天，就必须这么做，有些事情不对劲，我们不能忽视它。但我们不能独自应对。" 明日香决定他们应该选择通往希望的道路，即使这条路可能布满痛苦。

"Okay." Shinji said as he brought his freshly burned hand to her cheek and caressed it gently before gently guiding her face towards his and they shared a tender kiss that did more to calm both their souls than any words could. The kiss ended and both lovers rested their foreheads against each other's. The comfortable silence filled the bathroom until it was broken by the German redhead:  
"好吧。" 真嗣说着，将他刚烧伤的手放在她的脸颊上，轻轻抚摸，然后温柔地引导她的脸转向他，他们分享了一个温柔的吻，这个吻比任何言语更能安抚他们的心灵。吻结束后，两位恋人额头相抵。浴室里充满了舒适的沉默，直到被德国红发女孩打破：

"But…I want you one last time, in case it is the last time." Asuka said telling herself this was not due to the fact that Shinji had interrupted her before she had…uhhh…finished with her earlier fantasy and her hormones were craving release.  
“但……我想要你最后一次，以防这是最后一次。”明日香说道，她告诉自己这并非因为真嗣之前打断了她，让她未能……呃……完成之前的幻想，而她的荷尔蒙正渴望释放。

Despite everything, Shinji managed to blush at her request. This initially perplexed the redhead until she looked down and saw the bulge that Shinji was unsuccessfully trying to hide. He was still a teenage boy seeing a naked girl in a bathtub after all, biology is biology.  
尽管如此，真嗣还是因为她的话而脸红了。起初这让红发女孩感到困惑，直到她低头看到真嗣试图隐藏的凸起。毕竟，他还是个看到浴缸里裸体女孩的青春期男孩，生理反应是不可避免的。

'Ah so he's horny too. _Wunderbar._' The tone of Asuka's mind as it said that last word might have been seen as aggressive, predatory even, to one who didn't know her or how her brain worked.  
“啊，原来他也欲火中烧。太棒了。”明日香脑海中说出最后一个词的语气，对于不了解她或她思维方式的人来说，可能会被视为具有攻击性，甚至是掠夺性的。

"Oh, did watching my youthful, glistening, _jiggling_, body do that to you, you perverted baka." Asuka said in her teasing seductive tones as she gave her chest a shake for good measure as her hand went for the zipper on his pants. Shinji stood up from the side of the tub to make the task easier and soon his black school pants and boxers lay in a circle around his ankles as his manhood stood before her. Bulging and veiny, the slight shine of precum on the bulbous cockhead.  
“哦，看到我年轻、闪亮、颤动的身体，对你有这么大的影响吗，你这个变态的笨蛋。”明日香用她那挑逗的、诱人的语调说道，为了加强效果，她还特意摇了摇胸部，手伸向了他裤子的拉链。真嗣从浴缸边站起身，让这个任务变得更容易，很快他的黑色校裤和内裤就围在他的脚踝周围，他的男性象征在她面前挺立。鼓胀且青筋暴露，圆润的龟头上微微闪着前液的光泽。

She took his member softly in her hand, stroking it ever so slightly and teasing it, tickling balls that were already taut with her other hand. Asuka then took him in her mouth, slowly at first, taking only the head and first third of his shaft, before working her way down almost his entire cock. The bathroom filled with the sound of Asuka's mouth slurping and sucking. Shinji was nearing what some would call Nirvana as he felt her tongue swirling around his shaft while the tips of her fingers struck gently across the surface of his sack.  
她温柔地握住他的那部分，轻轻地抚摸并挑逗着，用另一只手逗弄着已经紧绷的睾丸。明日香随后将他含入口中，起初很慢，只含住头部和前三分之一的部分，然后逐渐深入，几乎含住了他整根。浴室里充满了明日香嘴巴吸吮和吞吐的声音。真嗣感觉自己快要达到某种意义上的涅槃，因为他在感受到她的舌头环绕着他的柱身的同时，她的指尖轻轻拂过他的囊袋表面。

Eventually Asuka was taking most of his cock into her mouth each time her head bobbed up and down. Her pride deciding that she wanted to feel the entirety of his length of his member in her she moved her hands to his hips and pulled back her mouth so it was just covering his cockhead, giving it a loud suck for good measure, before she plunged down the length of his shaft.  
最终，明日香每次上下摆动头部时，都能将他的大部分阴茎含入口中。她的骄傲让她决定要感受他整个阴茎的长度，于是她将双手移到他的臀部，将嘴巴拉开，只覆盖住他的龟头，并用力吸了一口，然后猛地吞下他的整个阴茎。

Her lips touched the skin of his crotch and felt the first whisperings of pubic hair there, the millimeter long fibers stiff and pointy.  
她的嘴唇触碰到他胯部的皮肤，感受到了那里初露端倪的阴毛，毫米长的纤维又硬又尖。

'Becoming a man are we? Maybe it's all the testosterone constantly flowing through your blood?' Her mind thought as her mouth and throat were too busy contracting and almost gagging on his cock.  
“要变成男人了吗？也许是血液中不断流动的睾酮在作祟？”她的心思在想，而她的嘴巴和喉咙正忙着收缩，几乎要被他的阴茎呛到。

Asuka arched her back so that her ass poked up out of the surface of the water, rocking back and forth as soap suds rolled down the curves of her body as her cerulean eyes looked up at Shinji's glazed over cobalt orbs. The sight and feeling was too much for his tensed balls that demanded release and would not be denied.  
明日香将背部拱起，使得臀部从水面翘出，身体前后摇晃，泡沫顺着她的曲线滚落，她那蔚蓝的眼睛望向真嗣呆滞的钴蓝色眼眸。这一幕和感觉对他紧绷的睾丸来说太过强烈，它们迫切需要释放，不容拒绝。

"Asuka I…" Shinji said in warning to the redhead who just managed to relax and ready herself as she felt the hot, white, ropey substance shoot into her throat before sliding down. Shinji extricated his cock from her as she gave a swallow for good measure before laconically saying:  
“明日香，我……”真嗣警告道，但红发女孩刚刚放松并准备好自己，她感觉到一股热腾腾、白稠的液体射入喉咙，然后滑下。真嗣从她体内抽出阴茎，她咽了一下以示完成，然后简短地说：

"Get in." “进来吧。”

'She's clearly not done with me yet.' Shinji thought unsure whether to feel trepidation or excitement.  
'她显然还没对我死心。' 真嗣心想，不确定是该感到忐忑还是兴奋。

She stood up in the tub her body glistening and covered with bubbly suds, that seemed to find the most seductive creases and crest to sit on or flow down, and grabbed a towel as a makeshift pillow for Shinji's head as he removed the last of his clothing and got into the lukewarm water.  
她从浴缸中站起身，身体闪闪发光，覆盖着泡沫，这些泡沫似乎总能在最诱人的褶皱和波峰上停留或流下，她抓起一条毛巾作为临时枕头，放在真嗣的头下，他脱掉最后一件衣服，进入微温的水中。

"Asuka it's-" Shinji said about to comment on the bath's temperature before he was silenced by a passionate kiss from the redhead , their tongues meeting and tackling with one another.  
“明日香，这水——” 真嗣正要评论浴缸的水温，却被红发女孩热情的吻打断，两人的舌头相遇并纠缠在一起。

"I know baka." Asuka said with a tender smile on her face as she reached behind her back and undid the plug, the water level dropping precipitously before she placed it back and turned on the hot water. "Until then we're going to have to keep each other…_warm._" She whispered the last word in his ear as she rubbed her still unsatisfied sex on his now flaccid member and began covering his lips with hers. The kissing was intense, lips and tongues moving over each other, seemingly of their own accord to cover as much of the other's mouth as possibly while teeth nibbled noses and cheeks and necks and ear lobes.  
“我知道，笨蛋。”明日香脸上带着温柔的微笑说道，她伸手到背后解开了插头，水位急剧下降，然后她重新插上并打开了热水。“在那之前，我们得互相取暖。”她在他耳边低语，同时用她尚未满足的私处摩擦着他现在软绵绵的部位，并开始用双唇覆盖他的唇。亲吻激烈而投入，唇舌交缠，仿佛有自己的意志，尽可能地覆盖对方的口腔，同时牙齿轻咬鼻子、脸颊、脖颈和耳垂。

Despite the well-known fact of men's inability to multitask Shinji managed to bring two of his left hand's fingers to Asuka's opening as they shared their passionate make out session. The musicians digits softly playing with the folds of her petals before first one then both fingers found their way into her pussy as his thumb slowly brushed at her clit. The fingers played with the warm, wet, fleshy creases and wrinkles of her insides, exciting the redhead and rekindling the fire that had been building.

The level and temperature of the water in the bathtub having reached appropriate amounts Asuka reached a hand back and shut off the faucet. His fingers kept stroking and massaging, coaxing the fire of desire into a raging inferno. Lighting shooting through her body as her nervous system sent shocks of pleasure up and down her back and thighs. Until finally, his thumb went furiously at her clit as he felt her pussy tighten around his fingers and knowing that she was close.  
浴缸中的水位与温度恰到好处，明日香伸手关掉了水龙头。他的手指继续轻抚和按摩，将欲望之火煽动成熊熊烈焰。电流般的快感贯穿她的身体，神经系统在她背部和大腿间传递着阵阵愉悦的冲击。直到最后，他的拇指在她阴蒂上疯狂摩擦，感受到她的阴道紧缩着他的手指，知道她即将达到高潮。

Their kissing paused as her entire body shook, sending ripples through the warm water, as Asuka crested her into her own orgasm and rested her head on Shinji's shoulder while her forehead touched the tub's side.  
他们的亲吻暂停了，她的整个身体颤抖着，温暖的水中泛起涟漪，明日香将她推向高潮，然后将头靠在真嗣的肩膀上，额头轻触浴缸边缘。

As she came down she became aware of something hard poking at her ass cheeks under the water, her mind quickly putting two and two together.  
当她逐渐平复下来，她感觉到水下有什么硬物顶在她的臀部，她的思维迅速将线索串联起来。

"Oh ready for round two are you, baka-Shinji? You pervert." She said teasingly as she rubbed her opening up and down his shaft.  
“哦，准备好第二轮了是吗，笨蛋真嗣？你这个色狼。”她调皮地说着，同时用手指上下抚摸着他的阴茎。

'More like four or five.' Shinji thought as he remembered this morning and the previous night. God hormones are great.  
“更像是四五次吧。”真嗣想着今早和昨晚的情景，心想荷尔蒙真是太棒了。

Asuka lifted up her hips and guided them into place, lowering herself onto Shinji's waiting member. The cock spreading the petals of her opening as it entered her, filling her with that familiar, comforting feeling. Their hips met and they shared a tender kiss before Asuka began moving. Her pace slow at first as her hips searched for the right rhythm and angle for the shaft inside her. Shinji moved his left hand under the water's surface to her ass to guide her movements and grab handfuls of her seductive posterior while his right hand went to her breasts and began playing with erect nipples there, eliciting moans from the redhead's lips before her teeth managed to find her lip.  
明日香抬起臀部，引导着位置，缓缓坐下，让真嗣等待已久的阴茎进入她的体内。那坚挺的肉棒撑开她的花瓣，带给她熟悉而舒适的充实感。两人的臀部相触，他们温柔地接吻，随后明日香开始移动。起初她的节奏缓慢，臀部寻找着合适的韵律和角度，以适应体内的阳具。真嗣的左手在水面下移到她的臀部，引导她的动作，并抓握她诱人的后臀，而右手则移到她的乳房，开始玩弄那挺立的乳头，引得红发少女的唇间发出呻吟，直到她的牙齿咬住下唇。

The water sloshing and splashing onto the floor as Asuka began to speed up her movements as she found the right spot. His cock stroking her increasingly tightening walls as the moans became harder and harder to hold back. She felt his balls again pulling back towards his shaft as she cradled his head in her arms pushing her wet chest into his face and her nipples into his waiting mouth. She felt his hands and tongue move over her breasts adding even more fuel to the building orgasm inside her. The German redhead's breath hitching as she bounced up and down on his cock.  
随着明日香开始加快动作，找到了那个恰到好处的地方，水花四溅，溅落在地板上。他的肉棒在她愈发紧致的壁内抽动，呻吟声越来越难以压抑。她再次感受到他的睾丸向他的阴茎根部收缩，同时她用双臂环抱住他的头，将她湿润的胸部压向他的脸，乳头送入他等待的口中。她感觉到他的手和舌头在她胸前游走，为体内逐渐升起的性高潮增添了更多燃料。这位德国红发女孩的呼吸随着她在他肉棒上上下跳动而变得急促。

Shinji stopped his ministrations of her nipples and wrapped both of his arms around her back as Asuka increased her pace as fast and as hard as she could, paying no mind to the fact that it looked like half the bath had ended up on the floor. She brought her mouth to his and soon after felt his crotch tense followed soon after by the spreading warmth as his load shot into her and filled her pussy. A muffled moan escaped into his mouth as the feeling of his cum brought her own orgasm and she trembled in his grip.  
真嗣停止了对她乳头的爱抚，双臂环绕到她的背后，而明日香则尽可能快而猛地加快了节奏，毫不在意浴室地板上仿佛有一半的水都被溅了出来。她将嘴唇贴近他的，随即感受到他的下体紧绷，紧接着是扩散的温暖，他的精液射入她体内，填满了她的私处。一声闷哼从她的口中逸出，融入他的嘴里，他的精液带来的快感引发了她自己的高潮，她在他的怀抱中颤抖。

Eventually the kiss broke and the two lover's cobalt and cerulean blue eyes bored deep into the soul of the other, knowing that no matter what they'd have each other.  
最终，亲吻结束，两位恋人的钴蓝与天蓝眼眸深深凝视着彼此的灵魂，深知无论发生什么，他们都将拥有对方。

And truthful words filled the air:  
而真挚的话语充盈在空气中：

"I love you." "我爱你。"

**Some Hours Later  几小时后**

The afternoon sun was sparkling off the Geofront lake thanks to Tokyo-3's collection of solar redirection panels, while several birds which somehow found their way down here chirped and sang as they flew between the oak and maple trees that shaded the benches along the lakeshore.  
午后阳光在 Geofront 湖面上闪烁，多亏了东京-3 的太阳能反射板，几只不知怎么飞到这里的鸟儿在湖边的橡树和枫树间飞翔，欢快地鸣叫着。

Under a well-pruned maple tree sat a bench and a couple dressed in school uniforms. The boy resting on the bench while the red-headed girl leaned against the tree. Enjoying the solitude of the moment.  
在一棵修剪得宜的枫树下，有一张长椅和一对穿着校服的情侣。男孩躺在长椅上，红发女孩则倚靠在树旁，享受着这一刻的宁静。

But soon that tranquility was broken by a purple-headed woman's loud cries:  
但不久，这份宁静被一位紫发女子的高声呼喊打破：

"Shinji! Asuka! _**FOOD!**_" The supposed adult and authority figure said as she ran to where they were and gave Shinji a great big bear hug as he stood up from the bench.  
“真嗣！明日香！开饭啦！”这位名义上的成年人和权威人物喊道，随即跑到他们所在之处，给了真嗣一个大大的熊抱，他刚从长椅上站起来。

"Here you go Misato." Shinji said as he stood somewhat unsteady and held out the box. Normally Asuka would have smiled and laughed at the display but not today, she might have come to a decision but that didn't mean she was overjoyed with the prospect.  
“给，美里小姐。”真嗣说着，有些不稳地站起身，递出了盒子。通常明日香会微笑并嘲笑这一幕，但今天不同，她或许已经做出了决定，但这并不意味着她对前景感到欣喜。

They had brought food, not just because they knew Misato would be hungry and having a full belly would hopefully make the conversation to come…easier, and to avoid suspicion. As for the spot they had picked it not for the view or the beauty but for its relative solitude and lack of prying eyes. Unless Section 2 was bugging every tree and every park bench in the Geofront. Which seemed unlikely as collecting information and analyzing it are two separate things. Besides which such a policy as that would create such a clutter of data, finding anything useful would be like finding a needle in a stack of needles.  
他们带了食物，不仅仅是因为知道美里会饿，吃饱了或许能让即将到来的对话……更容易些，也是为了避免引起怀疑。至于他们选择的地方，不是因为风景或美丽，而是因为它相对僻静，少有窥探的目光。除非第二支部在每一个树和公园长椅上都装了窃听器。这似乎不太可能，因为收集信息和分析信息是两码事。再者，这样的政策会产生大量数据，从中找到有用的信息就像在一堆针里找一根针一样困难。

"Ah you know I love you're homemade gyoza!" Misato said as she took the box of meat-filled dumplings and began to eat with a ravenousness that rivalled Asuka's.  
“啊，你知道我超爱你的自制饺子！”美里说着，接过那盒肉馅饺子，开始狼吞虎咽，那股劲头堪比明日香。

"Well we haven't seen you at all and baka Shinji here was worried about you." Asuka said as she put her hands on her hips and took in a deep breath of the picturesque scene before them. "You really ought to get out of those stuffy corridors more often." Asuka said as a smile at the scene before them succeeded in putting a smile on her face.  
“我们可是一点都没见到你，笨蛋真嗣还担心你呢。”明日香双手叉腰，深吸了一口眼前如画的美景。“你真该多出来走走，别老待在那闷闷的走廊里。”明日香说着，眼前的景象让她不禁露出了微笑。

"I know Asuka, and I want to but between all the stuff that's been happening these last few weeks there's just been no time." Misato said as she paused to breathe and answer Asuka's remark.  
“我知道，明日香，我也想啊，但过去这几周事情接二连三，根本没时间。”美里停顿了一下，回应明日香的话。

"Speaking of work, did you get a chance to talk to Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki about Rei's apartment?" Shinji asked causing Misato to pause. She swallowed the food in her mouth and then guiltily looked at the ground before speaking:  
"说到工作，你有没有机会和副司令官冬月先生谈谈绫波的公寓问题？" 真嗣问道，这让美里停了下来。她咽下嘴里的食物，然后内疚地看着地面，才开口说：

"Oh no, it completely slipped my mind." Before regaining her usual poise, "But I promise I'll do it soon, tomorrow or the day after at the absolute latest."  
"哦不，我完全忘了这件事。" 她恢复了平时的镇定，"但我保证我会尽快处理，最迟明天或后天。"

"It's okay Misato, we understand the last two weeks must have been hell." Asuka said reassuringly to her guardian as she finished off the last of the food they had brought.  
"没关系，美里，我们理解过去两周一定很艰难。" 明日香安慰着她的监护人，同时吃完了他们带来的最后一点食物。

"Well thanks for bringing the food guys, but I've got to get back to work." Major Katsuragi said as she picked up the Styrofoam tray and other refuse.  
"好吧，谢谢你们带食物来，但我得回去工作了。" 葛城美里少校说着，拿起了一次性泡沫餐盘和其他垃圾。

"Actually Misato…" Shinji started in his awkward manner before continuing "…there was something else we wanted to talk to you about."  
"其实，美里…" 真嗣以他那笨拙的方式开口，接着说道 "…我们还有别的事情想和你谈谈。"

"Oh what?" Misato said as she paused tray in hand and looked at her two wards who had moved and were now standing next to each other.  
"哦，什么事？" 美里说着，手中拿着餐盘停了下来，看着她的两个孩子，他们已经移动并站在了一起。

"So you remember when we were both stuck inside the Twelfth Angel." Asuka began trying her best to look at the NERV Major in the eye.  
"所以你还记得我们俩都被困在第十二使徒里的时候吧。" 明日香开始尽力直视 NERV 的作战部长。

"Yeah" Misato said. From her tone it was clear that she didn't like where this was going.  
"嗯" 美里说道。从她的语气可以明显听出，她不喜欢这个话题的发展方向。

"Well, when we were in there we did feel something, something that didn't get put in the reports." Asuka continued, failing at maintaining eye contact as her eyes looked at the lake's sparkling water.  
"好吧，我们在里面的时候确实感受到了一些东西，一些没有被记录在报告里的东西。" 明日香继续说着，没能保持眼神接触，她的目光转向了湖面上闪烁的水波。

"What?" The Major asked slightly impatient.  
"什么？" 少校略显不耐烦地问道。

"Our mothers." Both her wards said in a unison that was slightly frightening.  
"我们的母亲。" 她的两个养子异口同声地说道，那同步的程度略显吓人。

"Are you sure?" Misato said regaining her composure and putting the empty box on the bench next to where the trio were standing.  
"你确定吗？" 美里恢复了镇定，将空盒子放在三人站立的长椅旁边。

"She didn't say anything, and I couldn't see anything definitive but I _felt_ her presence and I _knew_ it was her." Shinji said with a certainty and conviction Misato had never heard him use before, that told her all she needed about the veracity of his claim.  
"她什么也没说，我也看不出什么确凿的迹象，但我能感觉到她的存在，我知道那就是她。" 真嗣用一种米萨托从未听过的确信和坚定说道，这让她完全相信了他的说法。

"It was the same for me as well Misato." Asuka added afterwards.  
"对我来说也是一样的，米萨托。" 明日香随后补充道。

"Why didn't you tell me or the investigative committee?" Misato said in her Major Katsuragi voice, deadly serious as Shinji and Asuka looked at each other for a moment.  
"你们为什么不告诉我或者调查委员会？" 米萨托用她那严肃的葛城美里少校的语气说道，真嗣和明日香对视了一会儿。

"Well like I said I wasn't sure whether what I saw was due to the angel or just a hallucination." Asuka began. "But after talking with Shinji about it and him also feeling his mother in the Eva I knew it couldn't just be a coincidence and that it had to mean something." She said looking at Shinji with what Misato could swear was a small, _**genuine**_, smile on her face.  
"就像我说的，我不确定我所看到的是因为天使还是仅仅是幻觉。" 明日香开始说道。"但和真嗣谈过之后，他也感觉到他母亲在 Eva 里，我知道这不可能只是巧合，一定有其意义。" 她说着，目光投向真嗣，米莎托发誓她脸上浮现出一丝真诚的微笑。

"You've read our files Misato, you know what our mothers mean to us." Shinji said by way of explanation.  
"你看过我们的档案了，米莎托，你知道我们的母亲对我们意味着什么。" 真嗣以此解释道。

"Yeah I-" Misato began but then paused as her brain fully processed the implications of what Shinji had just said. "Wait a minute Shinji you know about Asuka's mother and…what happened to her." Misato said that last part quietly and solemnly.  
"是啊，我——" 米莎托开口，但随即停顿，她的脑海完全理解了真嗣刚才那番话的含义。"等等，真嗣，你知道明日香的母亲以及……她发生了什么。" 米莎托最后那部分轻声而肃穆地说道。

"Yes, yes I do." Shinji said as he looked towards the laces on his shoes rather uneasily.  
“是的，是的，我确实记得。” 真嗣说着，目光不安地转向鞋带。

"Wow, guess you two **are** closer than I thought." Misato said as she scratched her head and let out a big bellowing laugh, but missed the nervous look between Asuka and Shinji, they knew what part was coming next as Misato recovered and continued "This really helps, now we know that Evas and the pilots' mothers are connected somehow. Can you remember anything else that might help us?"  
“哇，看来你们俩比我想象的还要亲密。” 美里说着，挠了挠头，发出一阵爽朗的大笑，却没注意到明日香和真嗣之间紧张的眼神交流。他们知道接下来美里会提到什么，当她恢复过来继续说道：“这真的很有帮助，现在我们知道 EVA 和驾驶员们的母亲之间有某种联系。你还能记得其他可能对我们有帮助的事情吗？”

Asuka and Shinji looked at each for a moment before Asuka spoke up:  
明日香和真嗣对视了一会儿，然后明日香开口道：

"The Angel seemed…um… rather interested in the… uh…human condition." Asuka said more self-consciously and uncomfortably than Misato had _**ever**_ heard the redhead speak before and this piqued her interest.  
“那位天使似乎……呃……对……人类状况相当感兴趣。”明日香比以往任何时候都更显得自我意识过强且不自在，这让美里感到好奇。

"In what way?" She asked with her eyebrow raised as she looked between her two wards as the awkward silence dragged on.  
“怎么个感兴趣法？”她挑起眉毛，目光在两个养女之间来回扫视，尴尬的沉默持续着。

It was mercifully disturbed however by Misato's phone ringing. Sighing she pulled the device out of her jacket's pocket and answered:  
然而，这尴尬的沉默被美里的手机铃声打断了。她叹了口气，从夹克口袋里掏出手机接听：

"Aoba wha-" Misato began before the frantic lieutenant interrupted her with information that caused her face to twist and turn into her serious commander's scowl.  
"青叶，怎么了——" 美里刚开口，就被急切的副官打断，他带来的消息让她的脸庞瞬间转为严肃指挥官的皱眉。

"We're on our way!" Misato said as she closed her phone and looked to her two pilots. "An Angel just breached the Gotemba Defense Line, get to the Eva cages now!" Misato ordered as she turned around and began running back to the NERV Pyramid.  
"我们马上到！" 美里挂断电话，转向她的两名驾驶员。"一只使徒刚刚突破了御殿场防线，立即前往 EVA 格纳库！" 美里命令道，随即转身跑回 NERV 金字塔。

"Yes!" Shinji and Asuka said in unison as they too began sprinting after the NERV Major.  
"是！" 真嗣和明日香齐声应道，也紧随 NERV 少校疾跑而去。

'Saved by the Angel eh?' Asuka thought as they reached the elevator to the Eva cages and soon were zooming on the express route through NERV's labyrinthine layout.  
“被天使救了，是吗？”明日香心想，他们到达了通往 EVA 笼子的电梯，不久便在 NERV 错综复杂的布局中疾驰于快速通道上。

Meanwhile Major Katsuragi had returned to Central Dogma just in time to see the central display show the first glimpses of the new threat that Tokyo-3's sensors had. She saw the Angel's bulbous black and white body, with its stubby limbs and white facemask, levitating over the mountains that ringed their fortress city.  
与此同时，葛城美里少校刚好回到中央教条区，及时看到了中央显示屏上显示的东京-3 传感器捕捉到的全新威胁。她看到了天使那圆滚滚的黑白身躯，短小的四肢和白色的面具，悬浮在环绕他们堡垒城市的群山之上。

"The Fourteenth Angel, Zeruel, the Hand of God." Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki said from his usual position standing next to Gendo Ikari as he sat above the commotion of the command center.  
“第十四使徒，Zeruel，神的使者。”副司令冬月耕造从他惯常站立在碇源堂身边的位置说道，碇源堂正坐在指挥中心的喧嚣之上。

"An apt name if the AT field readings the Magi have given are accurate." Gendo said to his old sensei behind steepled hands.  
"如果 MAGI 的 AT 力场读数准确，那真是个贴切的名字。" 碇源堂对着他昔日的导师，双手交叠成塔状说道。

"Target all of our defensive batteries on the Angel, we need to buy enough time to deploy the Evas!" Operations Director Katsuragi yelled out to the bridge crew as they furiously manipulated the pixels on their screen to make that order a reality.  
"将我们所有的防御炮台对准使徒，我们需要争取足够的时间来部署 EVA！" 作战部长葛城美里向桥上的工作人员大声喊道，他们正疯狂地操作着屏幕，将这一命令变为现实。

"We're lucky they were in the Geofront, the crew reports they're already in their plugsuits and entering the entry plugs now." Lieutenant Hyuga said.  
"幸好他们在地底都市，机组人员报告说他们已经穿上插入栓服，正在进入插入栓。" 副官青叶茂说道。

"Let's not waste the good fortune then." The NERV Major said in a much more Misato voice to the young lieutenant. "FIRE" She switched back to her officer persona as she gave the order.  
"我们别浪费这好运气了。" NERV 的少校用更像是美里声音的语气对年轻的少尉说道。"开火" 她切换回军官身份，下达了命令。

Hundreds of meters above them every operational weapon that Tokyo-3 had fired at the approaching enemy. Rockets and shells of every caliber, cruise missiles, gatling guns, everything they had whizzed through the air toward the Angel causing a fearsome lightshow even in the late afternoon sunlight as the sky was filled with tracers. The firepower would have been enough to destroy an army, and in fact the weapons unleashed did destroy something, the surface of the mountain beneath the Angel as its AT field absorbed or deflected all the incoming shots.  
在他们上方数百米处，东京-3 拥有的所有可操作武器都向逼近的敌人开火。各种口径的火箭和炮弹、巡航导弹、加特林机枪，他们拥有的一切都呼啸着穿过空中，射向使徒，即使在午后阳光下，也造成了令人畏惧的光影秀，天空中充满了曳光弹。这种火力足以摧毁一支军队，事实上，这些武器确实摧毁了某样东西——使徒下方山体的表面，因为其 AT 力场吸收或偏转了所有来袭的射击。

However, it was not a one-way exchange and soon the tell-tale flash could be seen in Zeruel's red eyes, immediately followed by four of the distinct cross shaped energy blasts impacting the city and silencing several of its defenses.  
然而，这并非单方面的交换，很快就能在 Zeruel 的红色眼睛中看到预示性的闪光，紧接着是四道独特的十字形能量爆炸击中城市，并使几处防御设施陷入沉默。

"Eighteen of the twenty-two armor layers have been penetrated!" Maya frantically called out across the bridge.  
"二十二层装甲中已有十八层被穿透！" 真希波在舰桥上急切地呼喊道。

"What!? Eighteen layers penetrated with a single shot?" Misato said shocked as she looked at the display to confirm what she had heard.  
"什么！？一击就穿透了十八层？" 美里震惊地说着，目光转向显示屏以确认她所听到的信息。

"The Evas are ready to deploy!" Aoba relayed some good news to the bridge.  
"EVA 们已准备就绪，随时可以出击！" 青叶向舰桥传达了好消息。

"Deploy them immediately or else the Angel will breach the Geofront!" Major Katsuragi ordered.  
"立即部署它们，否则使徒将突破第三新东京市！"葛城美里少校命令道。

Less than a second later the catapults launched the Evas in tandem to the surface at the heavy armory closest to the Angel. They were going to need heavy firepower to deal with its AT field. Asuka opted for dual-wielding rocket launchers while Shinji grabbed the classic pallet rifle.  
不到一秒钟后，弹射器将 EVA 同步发射至地表，靠近使徒的重型军械库。他们需要强大的火力来对付其 AT 力场。明日香选择了双持火箭发射器，而真嗣则抓起了经典的弹匣步枪。

"Enemy spotted." Shinji reported over his comms. His voice serious and his face dead set, a far cry from his first sorties as he found determination in his desire to protect the people he cared about. Despite herself Asuka glance to the audio and visual comm displayed on her entry plug wall and glanced at her lover. In spite of the horrific danger she felt safe, knowing he was there by her side.  
"发现敌人。"真嗣通过通讯器报告。他的声音严肃，面容坚定，与他初次出击时判若两人，他在保护他所关心的人的渴望中找到了决心。尽管如此，明日香还是不由自主地瞥了一眼插入栓墙壁上显示的音视频通讯，看向她的爱人。尽管面临可怕的危险，她感到安心，知道他就在她身边。

"Engage when it comes into range. Rei's Unit-00 is still combat ineffective so you two are on your own." Misato ordered.  
“进入射程后立即开火。零的零号机仍无法投入战斗，所以你们俩得靠自己了。”美里命令道。

"Understood." Asuka said as the targeting computer in her entry plug counted down the last seconds until the Angel got into range.  
“明白。”明日香回应道，她的插入栓内的目标锁定计算机正倒数着天使进入射程的最后几秒。

They opened up on the Angel as it approached one of the breaches it had made in the city's armor plating. Rockets from Asuka's launchers and artillery sized shells from Shinji's pallet rifle streamed toward the levitating body and exploded in a flurry of impact but left no effect.  
当天使接近它在城市装甲板上制造的一个裂口时，他们向其开火。明日香的火箭发射器射出的火箭和真嗣的弹匣步枪发射的炮弹大小的子弹如雨般射向悬浮的身体，爆炸声此起彼伏，却未造成任何影响。

"We're not neutralizing its AT field at this range! We have to get closer!" Asuka yelled over comms as she abandoned her empty rocket launchers and grabbed a pallet rifle.  
“在这个距离我们无法中和它的 AT 力场！我们必须靠近！”明日香通过通讯器大喊，同时丢弃了空火箭发射器，抓起一把托盘步枪。

"Right!" Shinji said as he also retrieved a fresh pallet rifle from a nearby armory building and began to weave through the concrete maze of Tokyo-3 toward their target demonstrating the combat capabilities and versatility that came with having an onboard S2 organ.  
“好！”真嗣应道，他从附近的军械库建筑中取出一支新的托盘步枪，开始在东京-3 的混凝土迷宫中穿梭，向目标逼近，展现出内置 S2 机关所带来的战斗能力和灵活性。

Zeruel seemed not to have noticed them, or at least paid as much attention to them as he had to the remaining defenses of Tokyo-3 that had never let up their assault, treating the Evas as just another battery to be ignored in pursuit of its true purpose. Its primal instinct telling it that its source lay below it, _somewhere._  
零尔似乎并未注意到他们，或者至少对他们和东京-3 剩余防御系统的持续攻击一样漠不关心，将 EVA 视为另一个可以忽略的障碍，一心追求其真正的目标。它的原始本能告诉它，其源头就在下方某处。

The Angel approached one the cavities its earlier blast had made, smoke rising from the still red hot metal of the breached armor layers that ringed the perfectly circular hole while the Evas sprinted toward the edge, getting in position just as Zeruel was beginning his descent.  
天使接近了它先前轰击出的一个孔洞，烟雾从仍炽热的被击穿装甲层中升起，环绕着这个完美圆形的洞口。与此同时，EVA 们疾速奔向边缘，准备就绪，恰逢 Zeruel 开始下降。

"Set AT fields to maximum and fire!" Misato's order sounded in their ear as they wordlessly complied. Too late did Zeruel realize the threat as he felt his AT field, his barrier between himself and the outside world through which nothing could pass unless he willed it, fade away. The familiar sense of security replaced with the pain of impact as pallet rifle rounds tore into his body. Chunks of black and white flesh were ripped from his body by the Teflon-tungsten projectiles, falling into the pit or staining the sides and nearby buildings with his red lifeblood. He let out a primal scream from his leering facemask as his survival instinct took over and caused a flash in the socket of his red eyes.  
“将 AT 力场调至最大并开火！”Misato 的命令在他们耳边响起，他们默默地遵从。Zeruel 意识到威胁时已为时过晚，他感觉到自己的 AT 力场——那层隔绝他与外界、未经他允许无法穿透的屏障——正在消失。熟悉的安全感被撞击的痛苦所取代，托盘步枪的子弹撕裂了他的身体。黑色与白色的肉块被特氟龙-钨合金弹头从他身上剥离，坠入深坑或染红了周围的建筑。他戴着狰狞面具的脸发出原始的嘶吼，红色的眼睛闪烁着生存本能的光芒。

"Watch out!" Shinji said just in time as he saw the warning just in time to redirect his AT field to shield himself and Asuka from the worst of the blast, though it still sent both Evas tumbling through the streets and buildings of Tokyo-3 as they lost their footing in the blinding light and violent explosion of an Angel's energy blast.  
"小心！" 真嗣及时喊道，他刚好看到警告，迅速调整 AT 力场保护自己和明日香免受爆炸最严重的冲击，尽管如此，两人还是被爆炸的强光和剧烈冲击掀翻，EVA 在第三新东京市的街道和建筑间翻滚，失去了平衡。

The threat dealt with, Zeruel resumed his descent toward the Geofront and began charging another blast to deal with the last layers of armor.  
威胁解除后，Zeruel 继续向 Geofront 下降，并开始充能另一发攻击，准备摧毁最后一层装甲。

"Are you okay baka?" Asuka said recovering first as she had been protected by both hers and Shinji's AT field. She manipulated the red Eva up from where it had torn a several hundred meter long stretch of road and, in a display that would have given half of NERV's collateral damage division a heart attack, went straight through an untouched building to where the purple Unit-01 had lodged its upper half into a building.  
"你没事吧，笨蛋？" 明日香率先恢复过来，她受到自己和真嗣 AT 力场的双重保护。她操控红色 EVA 从撕裂了数百米长的道路中站起，以一种足以让 NERV 一半的附属损害部门心脏病发作的气势，径直穿过一座完好无损的建筑，来到紫色初号机上半身嵌入的建筑处。

"Yeah I just need a minute." Shinji said as he operated the controls in his entry plug so his Eva grabbed Unit-02's hand to help itself up.  
“嗯，我只需要一分钟。”真嗣说着，操作着插入栓内的控制器，让他的 Eva 抓住 2 号机的手，帮助自己站起来。

"We don't have a minute!" The usually calm and collected Sub-commander Fuyutsuki barked over the comms as they heard another explosion.  
“我们没有一分钟的时间了！”平时冷静沉着的副司令冬月通过通讯器急促地喊道，他们听到了另一声爆炸。

"The Angel has breached the last of the armor layers and is moving into the Geofront! Get here now!" Major Katsuragi said over the audio link to the Evas before giving more orders to the bridge crew, "Deploy the Geofront rocket batteries and ready the fixed firing positions!" At Misato's command the MLRS vehicles with a hastily painted "UN" on the side moved into position as the melted slag of armor plate, shattered concrete, dirt, and dust rained down into the, now breached, subterranean fortress.  
“使徒已经突破了最后一层装甲，正向 Geofront 移动！立刻赶到这里！”葛城美里少校通过音频链接向 Eva 驾驶员们下达命令，随后又向舰桥人员发出指令，“部署 Geofront 火箭炮，准备固定发射位置！”在美里的命令下，侧面匆忙涂有“联合国”标志的多管火箭炮车迅速就位，熔化的装甲板、碎裂的混凝土、泥土和尘埃如雨般倾泻而下，落入如今已被攻破的地下堡垒。

The projectiles had predictable results as the full salvo of the Geofront garrison seemed to not even inconvenience the Angel as he peered and leered seemingly searching for something., paying no heed to man's simple constructs. However, man's more complex constructs had made their way to the hole Zeruel had made and retrieving their onboard progressive knives.  
那些弹药产生了可预见的效果，仿佛整个第三新东京市防卫部队的齐射对使徒来说根本不值一提，他只是四处张望，似乎在寻找什么，对人类的简单造物毫不在意。然而，人类的复杂造物已经抵达了 Zeruel 制造的洞口，取出了它们搭载的推进式刀刃。

"Ready?" Asuka said as she looked to the left in her entry plug and saw Shinji's nodding face transmitted there. Without needing any more words they tensed their Evas' legs and jumped off the edge of the breach, arms poised to stab their blades into the enemy as their AT fields powered to maximum to get through the Angel's defenses. Their rapid descent at terminal velocity was halted as they simultaneously grabbed hold onto the bony protrusions, that roughly were where shoulders would be on a biped, with their free hands and plunged their progressive knives into the Angel on either side of its faceplate sending arterial blood spraying across the roof of the Geofront and coating several of the nearby retracted buildings as Zeruel screamed in pain.  
“准备好了吗？”明日香说道，她向左看去，在插入栓里看到了点头回应的碇真嗣。无需更多言语，他们紧绷 EVA 的双腿，从破口边缘一跃而下，手臂准备将刀刃刺入敌人，AT 力场全开以突破使徒的防御。他们在终端速度下的急速下落被同时抓住了那些骨状突起——大致相当于双足动物的肩膀位置——用空着的手，并将推进式刀刃插入了使徒面甲的两侧，喷涌而出的动脉血洒满了第三新东京市的屋顶，染红了附近几座缩回的建筑，Zeruel 痛苦地尖叫着。

On either side of the screeching Angel ribbon like appendages unfurled, their delicate appearance hiding their true and threatening nature. Moving faster than either Shinji or Asuka could react the arms whacked them away sending hundreds of tons of alloyed armor and cloned flesh careening down into the Geofront.  
在尖叫的天使两侧，带状的附属物展开，它们精致的外表掩盖了其真实且威胁性的本质。这些手臂移动速度之快，使得真嗣和明日香都来不及反应，便被击飞，数百吨的合金装甲和克隆肉体随之坠入地底都市。

Thankfully it had been the broad side of each of the ribbony arms that had swatted away the red and purple mechs from their handholds on Zeruel's body. Unfortunately many of the retracted buildings had not been so lucky.  
幸运的是，击飞红色和紫色机体的，是那些带状手臂的宽阔侧面。不幸的是，许多已收回的建筑就没有这么幸运了。

"Watch those arms! They'll cut right through you!" Shinji said in warning as he watched the shorn pieces of skyscraper crash around them in the Geofront. While back in Central Dogma Misato relayed a new order to the bridge crew:  
“小心那些手臂！它们会直接切穿你！”真嗣警告道，同时注视着被切断的摩天大楼碎片在地底都市中坠落。而在中央教条区，美里向桥员们传达了新的指令：

"Move the buildings out of battle position and back up to the surface!" She said moving over to Maya's terminal.  
"将建筑从战斗位置移出，恢复到地表状态！" 她边说边走向麻衣的终端。

"But Major we're still in combat!" Lieutenant Ibuki protested.  
"但是少校，我们仍在战斗中！" 副官伊吹蓝抗议道。

"We want the city on the _**other**_side of the armor layers from where the fight is! Wherever that happens to be!" Major Katsuragi replied, causing Maya to comply as she saw the logic. "Aoba! Are the batteries reloaded yet!?"  
"我们希望城市在装甲层另一侧，远离战斗地点！无论那是在哪里！" 葛城美里少校回答，麻衣理解了逻辑后随即执行。"青叶！电池重新装填好了吗！？"

"Yes Major!" The long-haired officer replied.  
“是，少校！”长发军官回答道。

"Great." The Operations Director said, the gears of her, unique, mind turning as she came up with a plan. "Shinji! Asuka! Extend your AT fields to maximum!"  
“太好了。”作战主任说道，她那独特思维的齿轮转动着，一个计划在她脑海中成型。“真嗣！明日香！将你们的 AT 力场扩展到最大！”

"Roger!" They both answered in unison as they braced their now standing Eva's in an open field several hundred meters from the NERV Pyramid. The nearly invisible field of energy that surrounded their Evas expanded toward the black and white, almost Rorschach, body of Zeruel, neutralizing its AT field.  
“收到！”他们齐声应答，随即在距离 NERV 金字塔数百米的一片开阔地带稳住了站立的 EVA 机体。围绕着他们 EVA 的近乎看不见的能量场向着黑白相间、近乎罗夏墨迹的 Zeruel 身体扩展，中和了其 AT 力场。

"Fire!" Major Katsuragi ordered.  
“开火！”葛城美里少校命令道。

Rockets and shells again cascaded toward the Angel, this time however they managed to do some damage and the weapon and vehicle crews of the UN Secondary Forces felt a sense of elation as they knew that the cries they heard from the enemy were caused by them.  
火箭和炮弹再次如雨点般倾泻向使徒，然而这一次它们成功造成了伤害，联合国次级部队的武器和车辆乘员们感到一阵狂喜，因为他们知道敌人发出的哀嚎正是他们的杰作。

The pride was short lived however, as Zeruel, not willing to just levitate there and be shot at, sent its ribbon arms toward Units-01 and 02 who managed to redirect their AT fields in time to prevent the lethal attack from making contact.  
然而，这份自豪感转瞬即逝，因为零尔不愿仅仅悬浮在那里任由射击，它将带状手臂伸向初号机和零号机，两机及时重定向了 AT 力场，才避免了致命攻击的接触。

The octagonal orange shields keeping the razor-sharp arms at bay for the moment as both Shinji and Asuka grit their teeth in effort in their entry plugs as the force drove them back. Their Evas feet digging up deep groves in the pristinely nurtured Geofront landscape.  
八角形的橙色护盾暂时挡住了那些锋利无比的触手，真嗣和明日香在插入栓中咬紧牙关，竭力抵抗着这股将他们逼退的力量。他们的 EVA 双脚在精心培育的第三新东京市地面上犁出了深深的沟壑。

The Angel then unleashed its own AT field, sending a shockwave that knocked both Evas off their feet and tumbling through the wooded Geofront. That threat dealt with Zeruel turned his attention to the artillery batteries that had caused him pain, the red flash all the warning there was before another energy blast ripped through the air and ushered in the obliteration of dozens of lives.  
随后，使徒释放了自己的 AT 力场，引发了一阵冲击波，将两台 EVA 击倒并卷入了树林密布的第三新东京市。在解决了这一威胁后，Zeruel 转向了那些曾让它感到痛苦的炮台，红色的闪光是唯一的警告，紧接着又是一道能量冲击波划破空气，带来了数十条生命的终结。

Zeruel, floating on his cushion of air, approached the downed form of Unit-01. The blast had left Shinji dazed and confused, the pain in his head blocking out the frantic voices of Misato and the bridge crew trying to get him to move.  
Zeruel 悬浮在空气垫上，接近倒地的初号机。爆炸让真嗣感到头晕目眩，剧烈的头痛让他无法听到美里和指挥室人员急切呼唤他行动的声音。

Across the torn up battlefield the Geofront had become Asuka managed to recover and felt a sinking feeling in her gut as she saw the unmoving form of her lover's purple mech and the looming form of Angel nearing his defenseless position.  
在已经被摧毁得支离破碎的第三新东京市地表，明日香好不容易恢复了意识，却感到一阵心沉谷底。她看到恋人真嗣的紫色机体一动不动，而那庞大的使徒正逼近他毫无防备的位置。

'_**NO!'**_ Her mind screamed at the sight as her lungs let out a battle cry in the entry plug as her synch rate surged and she moved her Eva faster than it ever had before and jumped through the air toward the Angel. The Eva flipping in the air to build up momentum before a deafening shockwave as Unit-02's right foot connected with Zeruel's facemask at near supersonic speeds, sending a crack down the middle between its black and red eye sockets.  
‘不！’她的内心在看到这一幕时尖叫起来，同时她的肺部在插入栓中发出战斗的呐喊。同步率飙升，她操控的 EVA 比以往任何时候都更快，跃入空中向使徒冲去。EVA 在空中翻转以积蓄动能，紧接着一声震耳欲聋的冲击波，02 号机的右脚以接近音速的速度击中了 Zeruel 的面具，一道裂痕在其黑红眼眶之间蔓延开来。

Shinji recovered his senses just in time to see the aerial form of Asuka's red Unit-02 gracefully soaring above the wounded Angel.  
真嗣刚恢复意识，就及时目睹了明日香的红色 02 号机在受伤的使徒上方优雅地飞翔。

"Nice Asu-" Shinji began as he opened the comm link, only for his words to die in his throat as he helplessly watched as one of the razor-sharp ribbon arms swipe Asuka's left side, opening a bloody gash in the red Eva as it went flying directly into the NERV Pyramid. Instead of Asuka's voice across the comms he heard her blood-chilling screams of sympathetic pain for the damage Zeruel did to her precious Unit-02. The force of the impact from Asuka's wounded Eva shook Central Dogma and nearly knocked Misato off of her feet.  
“好样的，Asu——” 真嗣打开通讯链接，话音却戛然而止，眼睁睁看着一条锋利的带状手臂划过明日香的左侧，在红色 EVA 上留下一道血淋淋的伤口，随后她直接飞向了 NERV 金字塔。通讯中没有传来明日香的声音，取而代之的是她因 Zeruel 对她的爱机 Unit-02 造成的伤害而发出的撕心裂肺的痛苦尖叫。明日香受伤的 EVA 撞击中央教条区，震动几乎让美里失去了平衡。

A primal, animalistic, growl escaped Shinji's lips as he brought his Eva up. Zeruel sent his razored arms toward the purple unit only for them to be stopped cold by Unit-01's AT field as Shinji lunged forward and gripped the "hands" of Zeruel's peculiar arms.  
真嗣低吼一声，操控 EVA 起身。Zeruel 将他的利刃手臂伸向紫色机体，却被 Unit-01 的 AT 力场生生挡住，真嗣猛地前冲，紧紧抓住了 Zeruel 那奇特手臂的“手”部。

The bolts holding Unit-01's jaw snapped and the Eva released its own sympathetic roar as Shinji's mind filled with rage:  
固定 Unit-01 下颚的螺栓断裂，EVA 发出了与真嗣心中怒火相呼应的咆哮：

'_**YOU! Hurt! Her!'**_ '你！伤害！她！'

His brain screamed as he registered the highest synch rate they'd ever recorded for a pilot as the muscles in the purple mech's arms bulged at the strain of trying to wrestle with Zeruel. Even with the power of the S2 organ and his own fury surging through the Eva it wasn't enough to force the Angel to the ground.  
当他注意到紫色机甲的肌肉因与零号机角力而鼓起时，他的大脑尖叫着记录下了他们有史以来最高的同步率。尽管 S2 器官的力量和他自身的愤怒在 EVA 中涌动，但仍不足以将使徒压倒在地。

Shinji turned his attention away from the stalemate for a moment and glanced at NERV Headquarters. The point of the Pyramid was gone and most of the surface was dented or a crumpled crater, Shinji didn't know it but somehow Gendo's esoteric office had survived this. His brain took a moment to register the implications before his mouth voiced them:  
真嗣暂时从僵局中抽离视线，瞥向 NERV 总部。金字塔的顶端已经消失，大部分表面凹陷或成了皱巴巴的弹坑，真嗣并不知道，不知怎的，碇源堂那神秘的办公室竟幸免于难。他的大脑花了一会儿时间来理解这些含义，随后他的嘴便将其道出：

"But where's As-?" He said just as he saw two red hands grab both the progressive knives still stuck in the Angel's body before violently removing them and in one swift motion cutting the ribbony arms he was grappling with at their source. The force holding back Unit-01's hands vanished as the Angel's arms fluttered to the ground as Zeruel fell onto his back, writhing and screaming in pain at the unexpected assault of Asuka's Unit-02.  
"但 As-在哪里？" 他刚说完，就看到两只红色的手抓住了还插在使徒体内的两把高频刀，猛地拔出，并迅速一挥，将他正与之搏斗的那些带状手臂从源头切断。束缚初号机双手的力量消失了，使徒的手臂像落叶般飘落在地，Zeruel 倒在地上，背部着地，痛苦地扭动着，尖叫着，因为明日香驾驶的二号机出其不意的攻击而痛苦不堪。

Tossing one of the progressive knives to Shinji as she came around to the front they synchronously raised their blades and stabbed toward the red orb on the wounded Angel's torso, only for a protective-lid membrane to close at the last second, shattering both of their knives on impact.  
她绕到前面，将其中一把高频刀扔给真嗣，两人同步举起刀刃，向受伤使徒胸前的红色球体刺去，却在最后一刻被一层保护膜盖住，两把刀在撞击下粉碎。

"Wha-?!" Asuka began just as the red flash of the Angel's energy blast filled her vision and sent both Eva's flying into the ceiling of the Geofront's far side.  
"什-？！" 明日香刚开口，使徒的能量冲击波便以红色闪光填满了她的视野，将两台 EVA 击飞到了地底都市远端的顶部。

"Shinji! Asuka! Respond! Are you alright!?" Misato frantically tried to contact her two wards and pilots.  
“真嗣！明日香！回答我！你们还好吗？！”美里焦急地试图联系她的两位监护人和驾驶员。

"It's no good Major, that blast appears to have knocked out their comms!" Hyuga said as his terminal showed large red error messages related to the Eva's external communications equipment.  
“没用的，少校，那次爆炸似乎摧毁了他们的通讯设备！”日向说道，他的终端显示与 EVA 外部通讯设备相关的大量红色错误信息。

Misato's eyes fell to the floor. There was nothing more she could do. The Geofront garrison was exhausted and no reinforcements could arrive in time. Her hands went to the cross around her neck, one the only things she had of the father who saved her, as she quietly uttered a single word:  
美里的目光垂向地面。她已无计可施。地底要塞的守军已筋疲力尽，援军也无法及时赶到。她的手抚上颈间的十字架，那是她唯一拥有的、曾救过她的父亲的遗物，她轻声念出一个词：

"Please." "请。"

"Baka are you alright?" Asuka said through gritted teeth as she held her right arm in the entry plug.  
"笨蛋，你还好吗？" 明日香咬紧牙关，在插入栓中抱着自己的右臂说道。

"Yeah but I can't raise Misato, or anyone else at NERV." Shinji said across the comm, also clearly in pain. The reason was soon clear as Asuka saw two arms, one purple and the other red, fall from the top of the Geofront. Unit-02's right arm made a splash as it fell into the Geofront lake, soaking the NERV cruiser floating there, while Unit-01's left arm flattened several trees as it plummeted into a forested area.  
"嗯，但我联系不上美里，或者 NERV 的其他人。" 真嗣通过通讯器回答，同样明显痛苦不堪。很快，原因就明朗了，因为明日香看到两截手臂，一截紫色，另一截红色，从地底都市的顶部坠落。二号机的右臂落入地底都市的湖中，溅起水花，打湿了漂浮在那里的 NERV 巡洋舰，而初号机的左臂则砸进一片林区，压倒了几棵树。

"So we're on our own." Asuka said, silently thankful that they still at least had their Eva-to-Eva comms. "He's got the range advantage, so let's get closer." Asuka said as she began moving and Shinji understood what she had in mind without her having to voice it.  
“看来我们只能靠自己了。”明日香说道，暗自庆幸至少他们还有 EVA 之间的通讯。“他射程占优，所以我们得靠近些。”明日香一边说一边开始移动，而真嗣立刻明白了她的意图，无需她明说。

The two Evas moved, as fast as their legs would carry them, in opposite directions toward the Angel presenting it with two threats and only having the means to deal with one. Zeruel charged another blast and aimed it at Unit-01, but, whether due to damage or luck, the shot went wide and struck the Geofront's curved side. Asuka in Unit-02 took the opportunity and with her remaining arm struck Zeruel's facemask, sending the Fourteenth Angel reeling. His bulging and torn mass then flew back on his levitating AT field, to get out of range as the Eva's renewed the chase.  
两台 EVA 迅速分开，以最快的速度向天使冲去，制造出两个威胁，而天使只能应对其一。零尔再次蓄力发射，瞄准了初号机，但或许是受损或运气使然，这一击偏了，击中了地底都市的弧形侧面。二号机的明日香趁机用剩下的手臂猛击零尔的面罩，使第十四使徒踉跄后退。他那膨胀破损的身躯随后在悬浮的 AT 力场中后退，以避开攻击，而 EVA 们则重新展开追击。

They repeated this attack eight more times, driving Zeruel across the entire length of the Geofront, weaving a helix as they went, until the Angel had been driven up the wooded hills near the Geofront's side.  
他们重复了八次这样的攻击，将零尔逼至地底都市的尽头，穿梭交织成一条螺旋轨迹，直至将使徒驱赶至地底都市边缘的林木丘陵地带。

With nowhere left to go Shinji and Asuka moved in for the kill. Unit-01 used its right arm to pin Zeruel to the wall of the Geofront while Asuka used Unit-02's remaining arm to grab at the Angel's cracked faceplate.  
无处可逃的 Shinji 和 Asuka 发起了致命一击。Unit-01 用其右臂将 Zeruel 钉在 Geofront 的墙上，而 Asuka 则利用 Unit-02 剩余的手臂抓住了天使破裂的面甲。

Zeruel desperately charged one last blast but the combined AT fields of Units 01 and 02 deflected the blast, scattering almost a dozen strands of energy around the Geofront, that scorched trees, turned metal to slag, and concrete to powder.  
Zeruel 拼命释放最后一击，但 Unit-01 和 Unit-02 联合的 AT 力场将这一击偏转，散射出近十道能量束，在 Geofront 周围烧焦树木，将金属熔为废渣，将混凝土化为粉末。

The red mech began pulling at the leering, cracked mask, pulling the sinewy neck out of Zeruel's body as its vestigial limbs thrashed at Unit-01's grip, frantically trying to escape. But Shinji held firm as a battle cry erupted from his mouth soon echoed by Asuka as she felt the Angel's wiry neck begin to tear.  
红色机体开始撕扯那张狰狞的破碎面具，将 Zeruel 体内扭曲的颈部拽出，其残留的四肢在 Unit-01 的抓握下疯狂挣扎，试图逃脱。但 Shinji 紧握不放，随着他口中爆发的战斗呐喊，Asuka 也感受到了天使那细长颈部开始撕裂，她的呐喊随之响起。

With one last effort the head came free with a satisfying rip and muffled scream. While Asuka smashed the already fractured facemask against the hard side of the Geofront, shattering it and quickly grabbing the sharpest piece she could find as an improvised knife. While Shinji had let go of his grip and instead focused his efforts on opening the protective membrane that covered the Angel's core. With one foot on the body of the Angel he managed to pry it open and reveal the churning reds and crimsons of a core whose roiling shapes vaguely resembled those movements of a cornered animal. Unit-02 moved into position and furiously shanked the boney blade into the core, over and over again, the roiling colors somehow becoming more frantic as the core began to crack. Before finally the orb yielded under the merciless assault and the knife penetrated, eliciting a loud shriek from the punctured core as the stirring colors darkened and vanished as Zeruel, the Fourteenth Angel, finally succumbed.  
随着最后一番努力，头部应声而落，伴随着令人满意的撕裂声和沉闷的尖叫。与此同时，明日香将早已裂开的头盔猛击在 Geofront 坚硬的侧壁上，将其粉碎，并迅速抓起最锋利的一块作为临时匕首。而真嗣则松开了手，转而专注于打开覆盖在使徒核心上的保护膜。他一脚踩在使徒的躯体上，成功将其撬开，露出了核心中翻滚的红与深红，其涌动的形态隐约像是走投无路的动物。二号机迅速就位，疯狂地将骨刃一次次刺入核心，翻腾的色彩随着核心开始破裂而变得更加狂乱。最终，在无情的攻击下，核心屈服了，匕首深深刺入，被刺穿的核心发出一声尖锐的嘶鸣，涌动的色彩随之暗淡并消失，第十四使徒 Zeruel 终于败下阵来。

Letting out pent up sighs Shinji and Asuka manipulated their Eva's so they were kneeling and wordlessly exited their entry plugs. As she was holding onto the cable lowering her down to the ground Asuka looked down the wooded hill toward NERV headquarters. The battle had started at the cusp of dusk and now night had truly fallen as the remaining streetlights and other illumination automatically turned on in the Geofront.  
释放着积压的叹息，真嗣和明日香操控着他们的 EVA 跪下，无声地离开了插入栓。当她紧握着将她降落到地面的缆绳时，明日香俯视着树木丛生的山坡，望向 NERV 总部。战斗在黄昏时分开始，如今夜幕真正降临，地下的街灯和其他照明自动亮起。

Reaching the grassy ground she leapt off and began running toward Shinji, and throwing caution to the wind buried herself in his chest as she reached him.  
一踏到草地上，她便跳下并开始向真嗣跑去，不顾一切地扑进他的怀中。

"Are you okay?" He asked as he embraced her, holding her in a tight grip that would rival one of Misato's infamous bear-hugs. By way of response she brought up her left hand and caressed his cheek before she puckered her lips, closed her eyes, and shared with him a kiss, of reassurance, of safety, of comfort, as she tightened her own grip around him.  
“你还好吗？”他拥抱着她问道，紧紧的拥抱足以媲美美里那著名的熊抱。作为回应，她抬起左手轻抚他的脸颊，然后撅起嘴唇，闭上眼睛，与他分享了一个吻，一个安慰的吻，一个安全的吻，一个舒适的吻，同时她也紧紧地抱住了他。

They stayed like that for a moment, shutting out the world, all the pain and stress and horror of the battle they had just been in. None of it mattered, they had each other.  
他们就这样停留了一会儿，隔绝了世界，忘记了刚刚经历的战斗中的痛苦、压力和恐怖。这一切都不重要，他们有彼此。

But eventually the tiny voices of logic and reason told them they should stop, that the recovery teams would be coming soon, that Misato would be coming soon, that someone would be coming soon.  
但最终，微弱的逻辑和理性声音告诉他们应该停下来，恢复团队很快就会到来，美里很快就会到来，很快就会有人到来。

"I love you Shinji." Asuka said as she looked into his eyes, and saw there fortitude, kindness, and love.  
“我爱你，真嗣。”明日香凝视着他的眼睛说道，在那里她看到了坚韧、善良和爱。

"I love you Asuka." Shinji said as he looked into her eyes and saw there passion, boldness, and love.  
“我爱你，明日香。” 真嗣说道，他凝视着她的眼睛，看到了其中的热情、勇气和爱意。

With great reluctance they both broke the embrace, let go of each other, and began wordlessly making their way back towards NERV, though despite everything they both wore a smile on their faces as they went.  
尽管极不情愿，他们还是分开了拥抱，松开了彼此的手，默默地开始向 NERV 总部走去，尽管如此，他们脸上都挂着微笑。

However, unknown to Shinji and Asuka, someone **had** already come and therewas a pair of eyes looking at them at that moment that had seen everything.  
然而，真嗣和明日香并不知道，已经有人来到了这里，有一双眼睛在那一刻正注视着他们，目睹了一切。

"Interesting." “有意思。”

**A/N:** And who could it have been that saw them? Speculation is welcome. The cat will be out of the bag soon, probably next chapter. The goal with this chapter was to show what the battle with Zeruel could have been if both Shinji and Asuka had been there and worked together. That's where the title comes from, since in the series the title card is A Man's Battle. As always let me know what you think of it. Apologies if the quality/editing isn't up to expected standards, this past month has been…lively.  
作者的话：究竟是谁目睹了他们呢？欢迎猜测。真相即将揭晓，或许就在下一章。本章旨在展现，如果真嗣和明日香都在场并携手作战，与零鲁的战斗会是怎样的情景。标题由此而来，因为在原作中，这一集的标题是“男人的战斗”。一如既往，欢迎大家提出意见。若质量/编辑未达预期标准，敬请谅解，过去这一个月实在是……热闹非凡。

### Chapter 9 A Shower Guest Special II: Let's Have a Picnic.  

Also, for those wondering this is a special, think apocrypha/one-shot set in the universe of my fic at an indeterminate time. So, if you're waiting for the aftermath of the Zeruel battle skip this, I'm doing this because I need time to plan out how I'm going to change Evangelion's final arcs from being soul-crushing, but I still want you guys to have the monthly update.  
另外，对于那些好奇的人来说，这是一篇特别的，类似于外传/短篇故事，设定在我的小说宇宙中的一个不确定的时间点。所以，如果你在等待零号机战斗后的后续，跳过这一篇，我写这个是因为我需要时间来规划如何改变《新世纪福音战士》最终章节的灵魂摧残，但我仍然希望你们能每月更新。

---
The bright sunbathed the world, or at least this small part of it making the day warm and pleasant. A far cry from the usual scorching or soaking weather that Post-Impact Tokyo-3 was known for. Under the sun's rays there was a girl who couldn't suppress a small genuine smile from forming on her lips as she walked. This girl, dressed in a school uniform was Asuka Langley Sohryu, pilot of the Evangelion Unit-02, and lover of Shinji Ikari thought of what the immediate future held as she was almost shaking with excitement. They were going to have a picnic: _**outside!**_  
明媚的阳光普照着世界，至少是这一小片区域，让这一天变得温暖而宜人。与后冲击东京-3 通常的酷热或潮湿天气相去甚远。在阳光的照耀下，一个女孩无法抑制地露出了真挚的微笑，她穿着校服走着。这位女孩，即式波·明日香·兰格雷，二号机驾驶员，同时也是碇真嗣的恋人，她对即将到来的时刻充满期待，几乎激动得颤抖。他们即将去野餐：在户外！

Shinji had found the spot, only a few meters in diameter, like a secret cove cut out of the forest near their school when he had been wandering and listening to his S-DAT in the months before Asuka had come bursting into his life like a cannonball on fire. The sides were thickly wooded and due to a quirk of how the woods grew there was only a single entrance to this isolated paradise that one would miss unless they knew where it was.  
真嗣找到了这个地方，直径仅几米，就像学校附近森林中被切割出的一个秘密小湾，他在明日香像一颗燃烧的炮弹闯入他的生活之前的几个月里，曾在这里漫步并听着他的 S-DAT。四周树木茂密，由于树林生长的奇特方式，这里只有一个入口，除非你知道它的位置，否则很容易错过这个孤立的天堂。

He'd never really made use of it, never a reason really. Almost forgot it existed in the euphoria that was his and Asuka's relationship. Until a few days ago:  
他从未真正利用过它，确实没有理由。在和明日香的关系带来的狂喜中，他几乎忘记了它的存在。直到几天前：

"_We can only be ourselves behind these walls." She had said, hand on the wall as she sat on the side of his bed._  
“我们只能在墙后做自己。”她曾说，手放在墙上，坐在他的床边。

"_I know a place we can try…" He had answered as his fingers intertwined with hers._  
“我知道一个我们可以尝试的地方…”他回答道，手指与她的交缠在一起。

The risk was great, but they were willing to take it.  
风险虽大，但他们愿意一试。

Asuka hoped that Section 2 still thought she and Shinji were in the school building because Section 2 **not** knowing where NERV's Evangelion pilots were was bound to trigger a shitshow. They'd both left the monument to boredom at separate times and from different exits that weren't easily monitored. Trying to mix stealth and nonchalance was difficult even for a genius like herself.  
明日香希望第二支部仍以为她和真嗣还在学校建筑里，因为第二支部不知道 NERV 的 EVA 驾驶员在哪里，肯定会引发一场混乱。他们俩分别在不同时刻从不易被监控的出口离开了那座无聊的纪念碑。即使是像她这样的天才，试图将隐秘与漫不经心结合起来也颇具挑战。

Though if those goons had been monitoring the Eva pilots intensely and knew precisely where they were at all times: why didn't Section 2 immediately grab them during the blackout leading up to Matarael's attack? Why did the pilots have to find their way back themselves to defeat the 9th Angel?  
不过，如果那些家伙一直在严密监控 EVA 驾驶员，并且确切知道他们的位置：为什么在玛特拉尔袭击前的停电期间，第二支部没有立即抓住他们？为什么驾驶员们必须自己找到回去的路来击败第 9 使徒？

These thoughts gave Asuka some comfort as she made her way down the winding path toward the cove where Shinji should be waiting for her.  
这些念头让明日香感到些许安慰，她沿着蜿蜒的小径走向海湾，那里应该有真嗣在等她。

She turned the last corner in the secret path and was greeted by a sight that caused her lips to turn into a smile. A shy boy with dark brown hair and cobalt eyes hurriedly laying out a red and white polka dot blanket. Despite the dense trees the small clearing was still bathed in sunlight.  
她转过秘密小径的最后一个弯，眼前的一幕让她不由得露出了微笑。一个害羞的男孩，深棕色的头发和钴蓝色的眼睛，正匆忙地铺开一张红白圆点图案的毯子。尽管四周树木茂密，这片小空地依然沐浴在阳光下。

"Hey baka." Asuka said, her voice tender and soft as she stood at the entrance of the clearing.  
“嘿，笨蛋。”明日香站在空地的入口处说道，她的声音温柔而柔和。

"Asuka!" Shinji said looking at her, his eyes lit up and a broad smile filled his face. "You came!" he said as he put his bento on the picnic blanket as the German redhead sat down on the fabric next to him.  
“明日香！” 真嗣看着她，眼中闪烁着光芒，脸上绽放出灿烂的笑容。“你来了！” 他说着，将便当放在野餐毯上，德国红发女孩随即坐在他旁边的毯子上。

"Of course I did! It was my idea!" Asuka said as she opened her bag and pulled out her own bento and the drinks, she had gotten from the vending machines before coming here. Mostly sodas and some juice, well at least that's what the concoction of chemicals and sugars called itself on the can at least. But it was cold and refreshing for a day like today.  
“当然来了！这可是我的主意！” 明日香说着，打开包，拿出自己的便当和饮料，这些都是她来之前从自动贩卖机里买的。大多是汽水和一些果汁，至少罐子上是这么自称那些化学物质和糖分的混合物。但在这个日子里，它们冰凉又提神。

Japanese usually picnicked during the Hanami Spring Cherry Blossom festivals, or at least they did in the Pre-Impact Japan that had seasons. Now with the only weather being hot or wet or both, the seasonalized aspects of Japanese culture and cuisine have begun to fade away as climatic reality makes them more and more impossible, and an entire generation has grown without them.  
日本人通常在赏樱春祭时野餐，或者至少在季节分明的冲击前日本是这样。如今，随着气候只剩下炎热或潮湿或两者兼有，日本文化和料理的季节性特点正逐渐消失，因为气候现实使得这些越来越不可能，整整一代人已经成长起来，从未体验过这些。

But as long as people lived, they would make a place for themselves, and strive to make it as happy as possible. Though if anyone knew the difference between wanting to be happy and _**being**_ happy, and the winding path between those states, it was the two who walked that road together out of darkness into light and whose place was here in this patch of wood on a blanket that hopefully wouldn't be missed.  
但只要人们活着，他们就会为自己创造一个地方，并努力使其尽可能快乐。虽然如果有人知道渴望快乐与真正快乐之间的区别，以及这两者之间曲折的道路，那就是这两个人，他们一起从黑暗走向光明，他们的位置就在这片树林中的一块毯子上，希望这块毯子不会被发现。

The satisfying pop of a can of soda being opened filled the patch of forest, followed by another as Asuka opened what she knew was Shinji's favorite.  
森林中响起了一罐汽水被打开的令人满足的“啪”声，紧接着又是一声，因为 Asuka 打开了她知道是 Shinji 最喜欢的汽水。

"Thanks." Shinji said as he took the proffered can of caffeine, sugar, and half a dozen other things he had no idea how to pronounce, let alone what they were.  
“谢谢。”Shinji 说着接过了那罐含有咖啡因、糖和半打他既不知道如何发音也不知道是什么的其他东西的汽水。

They were mostly quiet as they ate the homemade bento boxes that Shinji had made for them the previous night. Chicken Karaage, Onigiri, and pickled vegetables satisfied their hungry stomachs as they took in the chirping birds, leaves rustling in the breeze, and all the other myriad sounds of nature in solitude.  
他们大多时候都很安静，吃着真嗣前一晚为他们准备的便当盒。炸鸡块、饭团和腌菜满足了他们饥饿的胃，同时他们聆听着鸟儿的鸣叫、树叶在风中的沙沙声，以及孤独中大自然的其他种种声音。

Once her ravenous hunger had been sated Asuka set the bento box aside and curled up under Shinji's arm and they laid down next to each other, his right arm wrapped around her as his left arm became his pillow.  
一旦她的饥饿感得到满足，明日香便把便当盒放在一旁，蜷缩在真嗣的臂弯下，他们并排躺下，他的右臂环绕着她，左臂则成了他的枕头。

The light breeze played with the leaves of the circular canopy above them, and they watched in silence seemingly mesmerized by the sight and simply enjoying each other's company.  
微风轻拂着上方圆形树冠的叶子，他们静静地看着，仿佛被这景象迷住了，只是简单地享受着彼此的陪伴。

As her head rested on Shinji's chest, Asuka's mind wandered: 'I can almost forget there are other people, a whole world, when I'm with this baka.' Asuka's fingers curled into the fabric of Shinji's school shirt as her mind continued with this idea, 'What would that be like? Just the two of us left alone in the world?' She thought as she laid there.  
当她的头靠在真嗣的胸口时，明日香的心思飘远了：‘和这个笨蛋在一起时，我几乎可以忘记还有其他人，整个世界的存在。’明日香的手指紧紧抓住真嗣校服衬衫的布料，她的思绪继续沿着这个念头展开，‘那会是什么样子呢？只有我们两个人，孤零零地留在这个世界上？’她躺在那里想着。

They stayed like that for some time before a light went on in Shinji's head and he tapped Asuka's shoulder, so she knew he needed to get up as he remembered something important.  
他们就这样待了一会儿，直到真嗣脑海中灵光一闪，他轻拍明日香的肩膀，让她知道他需要起身，因为他记起了某件重要的事情。

"Oh, I almost forgot!" Shinji said as he got up from his position next to her and dug around in his school bag, mumbling under his breath until he finally found the container he had been looking for and opened it for Asuka's eyes to behold.  
“哦，我差点忘了！”真嗣说着从她身边起身，在书包里翻找起来，嘴里嘀咕着，直到终于找到了他在找的容器，并打开来让明日香一睹为快。

"Strawberries?" Asuka said somewhat surprised. "How did you find those?" She asked with genuine interest as she looked at the round juicy fruit that Second Impact had made increasingly rare in Japan. Though for reasons less climatic and more economic in nature.  
"草莓？" 明日香有些惊讶地说道。"你怎么找到这些的？" 她带着真切的兴趣问道，目光落在那些圆润多汁的水果上，第二次冲击使得草莓在日本变得越来越稀有，尽管这更多是经济而非气候原因造成的。

"A nice old man with a greenhouse next to Lake Ashi." Shinji said by way of an answer as Asuka wondered how much that must have cost. "Now open wide." He said as he picked up one of the strawberries with its top cut off and guided it toward Asuka's face. She opened her mouth and was rewarded by the sugary sweet taste as Shinji's hand caressed her cheek. Her hand went up and held Shinji's hand to her face. They looked into each other's eyes, windows to the soul, neither one could hardly remember how it had been when the other's eyes had been opaque and not filled with love and warmth. Their faces moved towards the other's, lips puckering and eyelids closing subconsciously in anticipation. Until at last their lips met and lightning coursed through their bodies like a circuit had just been closed, allowing the current to volt through them, filling them with warmth.  
"一个湖边慈祥的老爷爷有个温室。" 真嗣这样回答道，明日香则在想这得花多少钱。"现在张开嘴。" 他说着，拿起一个去蒂的草莓，引导它靠近明日香的脸。她张开嘴，尝到了那甜蜜的味道，真嗣的手轻抚她的脸颊。她的手抬起，握住真嗣的手贴在自己脸上。他们凝视着彼此的眼睛，那是心灵的窗户，几乎记不起对方的眼神曾几何时是那么晦暗，而非如今充满爱意与温暖。他们的脸缓缓靠近，嘴唇撅起，眼睑不自觉地闭合，满怀期待。直到最终，他们的唇相遇，闪电般的感觉贯穿全身，仿佛电路刚刚闭合，电流涌动，温暖充盈。

"My turn." Asuka said, after the kiss had ended, her hand already feeling for a strawberry in the container. Her lithe fingers eventually found one and steered it into Shinji's mouth. Shinji ate it less gracefully then Asuka did, but what do you expect, it's Shinji, he's a guy.  
"轮到我了。" 接吻结束后，明日香说道，她的手已经开始在容器中摸索草莓。她纤细的手指最终找到了一个，并将其送入真嗣的嘴里。真嗣吃草莓的姿态不如明日香那般优雅，但你能期待什么呢，他是真嗣，他是个男生。

"Thanks." Shinji said as he picked up another strawberry to feed to Asuka.  
"谢谢。" 真嗣说着，拿起另一颗草莓准备喂给明日香。

"Bet you I can catch it." The German redhead said leaning back and opening her mouth. Shinji complied and tossed the strawberry, but it went wide and looked like it would miss. But Asuka wasn't willing to give up, her pride giving her the speed and dexterity she needed to bite her teeth into the fruity red flesh just millimeters above the polka dot blanket.  
"敢不敢打赌我能接住它。" 德国红发少女说着，向后仰去并张开了嘴。真嗣照做了，抛出草莓，但它偏离了方向，眼看就要错过。然而明日香并不打算放弃，她的骄傲赋予了她所需的速度和灵巧，她的牙齿在距离波点毯子仅几毫米的地方咬住了那鲜红的果肉。

"You are such a terrible shot." Asuka said, her words muffled by the strawberry clenched between her teeth. "But I'm a great catcher." She said after she had swallowed down the succulent morsel.  
"你真是糟糕透顶的射手。" 明日香说道，她的声音被咬在齿间的草莓闷住了。"但我是个出色的捕手。" 她咽下那多汁的一口后说道。

"Yeah, you sure are." Shinji said, desperately trying to hold in a laugh. Asuka couldn't figure out what was so funny and replayed the events back in her mind and her face blushed crimson as realized the double entendre.  
"没错，你确实是。" 真嗣说，拼命忍住笑意。明日香不明白有什么好笑的，在脑海中回放刚才的情景，她的脸颊顿时涨得通红，意识到那双关语的意味。

'Baka, making me embarrassed.' Asuka thought in her mind as her eyes spotted the last strawberry in its plastic container. 'Well two can play at that game.' She thought as a mischievous smile filled her lips. She undid the top buttons of her school uniform and holding the strawberry directly above her mouth she "accidentally" dropped the berry so that it landed between her breasts.  
'笨蛋，害我尴尬。' 明日香心中暗想，目光落在了塑料盒里的最后一颗草莓上。'好吧，这游戏我也会玩。' 她想着，嘴角勾起一抹调皮的笑。她解开校服上衣的几颗扣子，将草莓举在嘴上方，"不小心"让草莓掉落，正好落在她的双峰之间。

"Oh no!" Asuka yelped overdramatically as her knees went together and her hands went to the side of her head. "Shinji can you help me?" Asuka said pleadingly her eyes big and puppy-dog like.  
“哦不！”明日香夸张地尖叫一声，双膝并拢，双手抱头。“真嗣，你能帮我吗？”她恳求道，眼神大而楚楚可怜。

'She's been reading too many of those "comics" she took from Kensuke's locker without asking.' Shinji thought as he sweat dropped at the ridiculous sight before him. But he was a hormone-filled teenager so of course he would take the opportunity presented.  
‘她肯定是从 Kensuke 的储物柜里偷拿了太多那些“漫画”，还没问过人家。’真嗣想着，对眼前荒谬的景象汗颜。但他毕竟是个荷尔蒙旺盛的青少年，当然会抓住这个机会。

"Don't use your hands they'll get sticky from the juice!" Asuka said trying to do her best impression of those stories' absolutely clueless girls who she had trouble believing could possibly exist in reality. Then again, she fought giant monsters for a living so hey anything's possible, I guess.  
“别用手，果汁会弄得黏糊糊的！”明日香试图模仿那些故事里绝对无知的女孩，她很难相信现实中会有这样的人。不过话说回来，她可是以与巨型怪兽战斗为生，所以嘛，任何事都有可能，我想。

Shinji leaned in close, his face right next to her bust as his teeth retrieved the succulent strawberry from between her fleshy mounds.  
真嗣凑近了些，脸紧贴着她的胸脯，用牙齿从她丰满的双峰间叼出了那颗多汁的草莓。

"Baka don't hog it all!" Asuka said as she lunged forward and dug her own teeth into the fruit in Shinji's mouth, ripping half of it away and eating it with a cheeky grin before returning to the clueless persona: "Oh there's still some sticky juice there. And we don't have any napkins. What are we going to do?"  
“笨蛋，别全吃了！”明日香说着扑上前，用牙齿从真嗣嘴里抢过一半草莓，带着俏皮的笑容吞下，然后又恢复那副无辜的样子：“哦，还有些黏黏的果汁呢。我们又没有纸巾。怎么办呢？”

'Seriously?' Shinji thought as he knew _exactly_ what she was implying she wanted him to do, 'I mean there's play-acting and then there's this.' The words danced in his mind even as his body answered her unspoken request, and his beet-red face went to her breasts so that his tongue could lap up the strawberry juices. He lingered there for longer than necessary, enjoying the softness of her breasts while Asuka made unnecessary and salacious moans like the characters in **those** stories. Eventually Shinji stopped and leaned back.  
“真的要这样吗？”真嗣心想，他清楚她暗示的意思，“虽说有演戏的成分，但这也有点……”这些念头在他脑海中盘旋，而他的身体已经回应了她的无声请求，涨红着脸凑向她的胸部，用舌头舔去草莓汁。他停留的时间比必要的更长，享受着她胸部的柔软，而明日香则发出那些故事中角色般的淫靡呻吟。最终，真嗣停了下来，向后靠去。

"I think I got it all." He said. But Asuka didn't immediately say anything her eyes were drawn to something else. Shinji realized too late what had caught his lover's attention.  
"我想我全搞定了。" 他说道。但明日香并没有立即回应，她的目光被其他东西吸引住了。真嗣意识到自己太迟才发现是什么引起了爱人的注意。

"Someone's horny." Asuka said dropping the persona and returning to her usual self, well the usual self that had developed during her relationship with the boy who had shown her what it meant to be herself. "Did my act do that to you? Maybe I'll give you one of Kensuke's dirty books when we get home if you liked it so much." Asuka said as her hand went to the bulge in Shinji's school pants stopping his belated efforts to hide it.  
"有人欲火中烧了。" 明日香说着，放下了伪装，回到了她与这个男孩交往后逐渐形成的常态。"我的表演让你这样了？或许回家后我会给你一本健司的色情书，如果你这么喜欢的话。" 明日香说着，手伸向了真嗣校裤下的隆起，阻止了他迟来的掩饰努力。

"You know I don't read those." Shinji said defensively, but kept his hands resting on the blanket as he leaned back, no sense interrupting a good thing after all.  
"你知道我不看那些的。" 真嗣辩解道，但还是把手放在毯子上，向后靠去，毕竟打断好事可不明智。

"Yeah, you just look at the pictures. Pervert." Asuka said as she undid the zipper on his pants, the irony was not lost on her however as a giggle escaped her lips. Shinji had no response to that, whether that was due to not wanting to be a hypocrite or all the blood in his body vacating to a different head he wasn't quite sure.  
“是啊，你就只看图吧。变态。”明日香一边说着，一边解开了他裤子上的拉链，然而这讽刺并未让她失去笑意，反而忍不住笑出声来。真嗣对此无言以对，不知是因为不想成为伪君子，还是全身血液都涌向了另一个脑袋。

Zipper and button undone Shinji's manhood stood at attention, bulbous and veiny as Asuka took the member in her hands, lightly stroking it. Her face lowered to his crotch as her lips placed feathery kisses on his cockhead and down the underside of his shaft while her luscious red hair flowed behind and around her head. Her left hand's nimble fingers meanwhile made their way to Shinji's exposed balls and fondled them gently, which despite the sweltering temperature managed to cover Shinji in goosebumps.

Feeling how aroused Shinji already was from her touch, Asuka pounced. She opened her mouth, relaxed her throat, and took Shinji's entire member into her mouth. It took every ounce of willpower that Shinji possessed to not simply cum, then and there. But he held on wanting to savor the moment and the feeling of warm and wet around his cock. He managed to open his eyes and look down at Asuka, her cerulean eyes open and looking up at his cobalt ones as she suppressed as best could a gag as the tip of her tongue furiously went at his balls.  
感受到真嗣因她的触碰而激起的欲望，明日香猛地扑了上去。她张开嘴，放松喉咙，将真嗣的整个下体含入口中。真嗣用尽所有的意志力才没有当场射出来。但他坚持住了，想要细细品味这一刻和围绕着他下体的温暖湿润感。他勉强睁开眼睛，低头看着明日香，她那蔚蓝的眼睛睁开着，抬头望向他深蓝色的双眸，同时尽可能压制住喉咙的不适，舌尖疯狂地舔弄着他的睾丸。

But eventually Asuka had to come up for air, though it was a new personal best for her.  
但最终明日香不得不上来换气，尽管这对她来说是个新的个人最佳记录。

"That was close." Shinji said as his hand went up to Asuka's head to play with her ear lobe.  
“差点就忍不住了。”真嗣说着，手伸向明日香的头部，玩弄着她的耳垂。

"Oh…baka…can't take…a little…stimulation." Asuka said between pants as her fingers played parallel up and down his shaft so that his cockhead went into her palm, this motion usually seemed to calm Shinji's manhood down when she wasn't ready for him to cum.  
"哦…笨蛋…受不了…一点…刺激。" 明日香喘息着说，她的手指沿着他的阴茎上下滑动，让他的龟头进入她的手掌，这种动作通常似乎能安抚明日香还没准备好让他射精时的真嗣的欲望。

"That was not a little." Shinji said through a light chuckle. Causing Asuka to giggle as well.  
"那可不是一点。" 真嗣轻笑着说。这让明日香也咯咯笑了起来。

"Well ready or not here I come." Asuka said after a moment more of shared laughter as she wrapped her lips around his cockhead. Her lips and tongue moved together to make a sucking sensation as her hand worked the saliva this produced up and down Shinji's shaft, her hand twisting as it went.  
"好吧，不管你准备好了没有，我来了。" 明日香在片刻的笑声后说道，她将嘴唇包裹住他的龟头。她的唇舌协同动作，制造出吸吮的感觉，同时她的手将由此产生的唾液沿着真嗣的阴茎上下涂抹，手在移动时还轻轻扭动。

This caused a not-quite moan to escape Shinji's lips as his hand on her head tried to guide Asuka's movements and slow her down a bit, but she was too free-spirited for that.  
这让真嗣不由自主地发出了一声近乎呻吟的声音，他放在明日香头上的手试图引导她的动作，让她稍微慢下来，但她太过自由奔放，根本不受控制。

The German redhead moved her mouth down from just the tip of his cock and now was taking almost half his length with each bob as her right hand picked up the pace and her left never neglected his sensitive sack.  
这位德国红发女孩从仅仅含住他阴茎的顶端，到现在每次上下移动都能吞下近半的长度，她的右手加快了节奏，而左手从未忽视过他敏感的阴囊。

It was too much for Shinji.  
这对真嗣来说太过刺激了。

"Asuka…" Shinji warned, actually managing to get her whole name out and not just sex-garbled syllables.  
“明日香……” 真嗣警告道，竟然完整地说出了她的名字，而不是含糊不清的呻吟。

She shifted her positioning and a moment later felt spurt after spurt of warm, gooey, viscous liquid impact the roof of her mouth before falling around his cockhead and pooling on her tongue sending a vaguely salty taste to her brain.  
她调整了姿势，随即感受到一股又一股温热、黏稠的液体喷射到她的口腔顶部，然后围绕着他的龟头滴落，汇聚在她的舌头上，带来一丝淡淡的咸味。

Shinji felt the constriction of her mouth around his spent cock as she swallowed down the load he had just put there. Asuka pulled her head up from Shinji's softening member and grabbed a napkin from their nearby bags and wiped the area around her mouth just in case.  
真嗣感觉到她的嘴紧紧包裹着他已释放的阴茎，她将他刚刚射出的精液吞咽下去。明日香从真嗣逐渐软化的阴茎上抬起头，从他们附近的包里抓起一张纸巾，擦拭了一下嘴周围，以防万一。

"My turn." Asuka vaguely heard Shinji say before his lips covered hers as his hands went to her shirt, unfastening the remaining buttons before going behind her back and expertly undoing the clasp of her bra. Her bust now exposed Shinji nudged her backwards as Asuka tried to regain some control by pushing her tongue into his mouth trying to dominate there at least.  
“轮到我了。”明日香隐约听到真嗣这么说，随后他的唇覆盖了她的，双手伸向她的衬衫，解开剩下的扣子，然后绕到她背后，熟练地解开胸罩的搭扣。她的胸部暴露无遗，真嗣轻轻推着她后退，而明日香试图夺回一些控制权，将舌头伸入他的口中，试图在那里至少占据主导。

She lay with her back on the blanket with Shinji on top as he continued his ministrations his fingers lightly twisting her nipples while his palms grabbed big handfuls of her breasts. A muffled moan escaped her as Shinji's attention hardened her nipples and stoked the fire in her belly. Eventually Shinji broke the kiss, and his mouth made its way down do her breasts, leaving a trail of kisses on her neck as he went, causing Asuka to shiver and goosebumps to cover her arms and legs.  
她背朝下躺在毯子上，真嗣压在她身上，继续他的爱抚，手指轻轻扭动她的乳头，手掌则抓握着她丰满的乳房。明日香发出一声闷哼，真嗣的专注让她的乳头变得坚挺，点燃了她腹中的火焰。最终，真嗣结束了亲吻，他的嘴向下移动到她的乳房，沿途在她的脖子上留下一串吻痕，让明日香颤抖，手臂和腿上布满了鸡皮疙瘩。

Meanwhile Shinji's hands found their way under her skirt and tugged at her panties. She lifted her ass to make it easier for them to come off and soon they were a scrunched ball of red cotton around her left ankle as Shinji's musician fingers got to work.  
与此同时，真嗣的手摸索到她的裙下，拉扯着她的内裤。她抬起臀部，让它们更容易脱下，很快，它们就成了一团皱巴巴的红色棉布缠绕在她的左脚踝上，而真嗣那双音乐家的手指开始工作了。

They started slow, up and down the labia of her bare pussy, while his thumb went to her clit, he usually didn't go immediately for the sensitive nub but: 'She started it.' He though remembering the earlier fellatio. He nibbled at her nipples while his tongue made circles around her areolas. All the stimulation caused the fire to build in her belly as her body reacted to the biological impulse to breed that was making her wet and her teeth to bite her lip as her brain absently remembered that the school was maybe two or three hundred meters away.  
他们开始得很慢，沿着她裸露阴唇的上下移动，而他的拇指则按向她的阴蒂，他通常不会立即触碰这个敏感的小点，但：‘是她先开始的。’他想着，回忆起之前的口交。他轻咬着她的乳头，同时舌头在她的乳晕周围画圈。所有的刺激在她腹中点燃了火焰，她的身体对这种生物本能的繁殖冲动做出了反应，使她湿润，牙齿咬住下唇，而她的脑海中不经意地记起学校可能就在两三百米之外。

Coating his fingers in the juices his efforts caused he plunged in his index finger. It felt like a furnace, a wet furnace to be sure, but still he wasn't sure if he'd ever felt her insides be this hot. He paused for a moment wanting to give the German redhead some time to adjust. But only a moment because soon another finger was inside her and they were stroking at the wrinkly folds of her insides as the fire in her oven became an inferno.  
他的手指沾满了因努力而产生的汁液，他插入了食指。感觉像是一个火炉，一个湿润的火炉，但他不确定是否曾经感受过她体内如此炽热。他停顿了一会儿，想给这位德国红发女孩一些适应的时间。但只是一瞬间，因为很快另一根手指也进入了她，他们在她皱褶的内部抚摸，她体内的火焰变成了烈焰。

It was too much for Asuka.  
这对明日香来说太过分了。

She bit hard enough to leave teeth marks on the bottom lip as her entire body shook as she reached her peak. Shinji stopped his successful ministrations and looked down at her panting form. He didn't have words to describe how he felt in that moment. How do you put the sight of seeing the person you love most in the whole world in a state of pure satisfaction that you caused? How can you?  
她咬得足够用力，在下唇上留下了齿痕，整个身体在她达到巅峰时颤抖。真嗣停止了他成功的爱抚，低头看着她喘息的身躯。那一刻，他找不到任何词语来形容自己的感受。你如何描述看到你在这个世界上最爱的人因你而达到纯粹满足的状态？你怎么能？

So, he brought his lips to hers and kissed her with a passion she returned in lieu of words while he pulled out two fingers that were covered in wrinkles like Shinji had been swimming all day.  
于是，他将自己的唇贴上她的，用一个她以同样热情回应的吻代替了言语，同时他抽出了两根手指，上面布满了皱纹，仿佛真嗣一整天都在游泳。

Asuka tapped Shinji's shoulder and he pulled away from the kiss as Asuka gulped down a few more lungsful of air before she managed to say what she wanted to.  
明日香轻拍真嗣的肩膀，他离开了这个吻，明日香又深吸了几口气，才终于说出了她想说的话。

"Feels like he's ready again." The German redhead said as her hand went to the shaft that was trying to poke out of Shinji's still unbuttoned pants.  
"感觉他又准备好了。" 德国红发女孩说道，她的手伸向了试图从真嗣仍未扣好的裤子中探出的那根东西。

"Haha, yeah." Shinji managed as he looked down, though when he looked back up Asuka was already standing up. Shinji was about to voice a question when Asuka's shirt and skirt fell to the picnic blanket and he immediately understood what she had in mind as he quickly extricated himself from his pants and shirt.  
"哈哈，是啊。" 真嗣勉强应道，他低头看了一眼，但当他再次抬头时，明日香已经站了起来。真嗣正要开口问些什么，明日香的上衣和裙子已经落在了野餐毯上，他立刻明白了她的意图，迅速脱掉了自己的裤子和衬衫。

Clothes laid haphazardly in a pile on the other side of the red polka dot fabric Asuka lay on her back with her legs spread open and Shinji between them. His shaft rock hard and his cockhead moving parallel between her outer lips as he wetted the tip with a bit of saliva before grabbing her hand, in the non-saliva-ed hand of course, and looking deep into her eyes as he pushed gradually into her. It amazed Asuka what a person could get used to, especially thinking back to the first time she had been with Shinji, the pain the pleasure. Now as he entered her she didn't even wince, instead she felt whole, wondering where she'd be in her life if she didn't know what this completeness felt like.  
衣服杂乱无章地堆在红色圆点布料的另一边，明日香仰面躺着，双腿张开，真嗣在她两腿之间。他的那根东西硬挺挺的，龟头在她外阴唇间平行移动，他用唾液湿润了顶端，然后抓住她的手——当然是没沾唾液的那只手——深情地凝视着她的眼睛，缓缓地推进她的体内。明日香惊讶于一个人能习惯什么，尤其是回想起第一次和真嗣在一起时的痛苦与快乐。现在当他进入她时，她甚至没有皱眉，相反，她感到完整，想知道如果她不知道这种完整感是什么感觉，她的生活会是什么样子。

Shinji smothered her lips in his as they shared a series of deep kisses, punctuated by moans emanating from Asuka as Shinji began to move inside her. He went slow but deep, pulling his member out almost to the cockhead before thrusting it back in fully with each stroke, his pace rhythmic as her body shook under the onslaught. Her legs went up behind his back, her ankles crossing just above the ass she thought was so cute.  
真嗣将她的唇紧紧包裹在自己的唇间，两人共享着一连串深沉的吻，期间不时传来明日香因真嗣开始在她体内移动而发出的呻吟。他动作缓慢而深入，每次都将自己的分身几乎完全抽出，仅留下龟头部分，然后再全力推进，节奏稳定，而她的身体在他的攻势下颤抖不已。她的双腿环在他的背后，脚踝交叉，正好位于她认为非常可爱的臀部上方。

The kisses stopped as Shinji turned his attention to her earlobes. The feeling of Shinji's teeth not-quite-scraping on the rubbery appendage sent a fresh wave of goosebumps across Asuka's skin as her breath hitched at the stimulation she was receiving.  
当真嗣的注意力转向她的耳垂时，亲吻停止了。真嗣的牙齿轻轻触碰那柔软的部位，让明日香的皮肤上泛起一阵新的鸡皮疙瘩，她因这突如其来的刺激而呼吸一窒。

Soon though Shinji leaned up, his back separating Asuka's legs as his member exited her. Asuka was about to voice an objection when her ears registered Shinji's request.  
不久，真嗣挺起身来，他的背部将明日香的双腿分开，他的分身也随之退出。明日香正要提出抗议，却听到了真嗣的请求。

"Flip over." “翻过来。”

The German redhead nodded in acknowledgement and soon enough she was on her knees, with her back arched, head near the ground, and arms outstretched, as she felt Shinji's cock enter her yet again as his hands grabbed at her ample ass to guide her onto his cock.  
德国红发女孩点头表示明白，很快她便跪在地上，背部弯曲，头几乎触地，双臂伸展开来，感觉到真嗣的阴茎再次进入她体内，他的双手抓住她丰满的臀部，引导她坐上他的阴茎。

She did like when he was on top of her, or when she rode him as they could see each other and kiss the other's lips. But, when they made love in this position she just _**felt**_ him so much deeper, so much fuller than usual. Her teeth found her lip again to prevent another moan as Shinji pounded into her with a much faster rhythm than he had been just moments ago.  
她确实喜欢他在上面，或者她骑在他身上时，他们能彼此对视并亲吻对方的嘴唇。但，当他们以这种姿势做爱时，她感觉他比平时深入得多，充实得多。她再次咬住嘴唇，以防发出另一声呻吟，而真嗣以比刚才快得多的节奏撞击着她。

Asuka could feel she was close, and Shinji could as well as her walls tightened around his rock-hard cock and his balls no longer impacted her ass as they retreated, readying themselves for the coming orgasm.  
明日香能感觉到自己即将达到高潮，真嗣也能感受到她的阴道壁紧紧包裹着他坚硬的阴茎，而他的睾丸不再撞击她的臀部，它们正在退缩，为即将到来的高潮做准备。

Asuka's knuckles were white as they gripped the polka dot picnic blanket, wrinkling the fabric in her death-grip as her body ached for release it knew was close.  
明日香紧握着圆点野餐毯的拳头因用力而泛白，她在死亡般的紧握中使布料皱起，她的身体渴望着即将到来的释放。

Her body didn't have to wait long. After a few more deep strokes Asuka's walls tightened and she couldn't back a moan as her wave of pleasure crested.  
她的身体没有等待太久。再经过几次深入的抽插后，明日香的阴道壁紧缩，她无法抑制地发出一声呻吟，随着一波快感的顶峰到来。

It was always hard for Asuka to tell when Shinji came when they were like this. She couldn't always feel the impact of his cum on her walls like when she was on her back or in the driver's seat, so usually she could only tell by his shift in rhythm or like now when she felt the sensation of his hot cum pooling in her pussy as he slowly exited her. The thick, white substance dripping out of her, leaving several grey wet stains on the picnic blanket before Asuka could get a napkin.  
对于明日香来说，当他们这样的时候，很难判断真嗣何时射精。她不像仰躺或驾驶座上那样总能感受到他精液撞击体内的冲击，通常只能通过他节奏的变化来判断，或者像现在这样，当她感觉到他的热精液在她体内积聚，而他缓缓退出时。浓稠的白色液体从她体内流出，在野餐毯上留下几处灰色的湿渍，直到明日香拿出一张纸巾。

In the afterglow of their rendezvous Asuka curled up under Shinji's shoulder, her head resting on his chest as their legs and fingers intertwined simply basking in each other's presence and surety it brought.  
在缠绵之后的余韵中，明日香蜷缩在真嗣的肩膀下，头靠在他的胸膛上，他们的腿和手指交缠在一起，只是简单地沉浸在彼此的存在和带来的确信中。

They lay there naked on the blanket looking at clouds as they passed over the small spot in the forest's canopy. The swirling cirrus clouds speckled with some cumulus passing by lazily as the afternoon slowly ebbed away into evening.  
他们赤裸地躺在毯子上，望着云朵穿过森林树冠中的小空隙。旋涡状的卷云点缀着些许积云，懒洋洋地飘过，午后时光缓缓流逝，渐渐步入黄昏。

"Thank you, Shinji." Asuka whispered into his ear as she kissed his cheek.  
"谢谢你，真嗣。" 明日香在他耳边低语，轻轻吻了他的脸颊。

"For what?" Shinji asked rather perplexed.  
"为了什么？" 真嗣有些困惑地问道。

"For today. It was amazing." Asuka said as a chirping warbler flew overhead before finding a spot unseen by the lovers in the trees.  
"为了今天。真是太美妙了。" 明日香说着，一只鸣叫的鹪鹩从头顶飞过，在恋人们看不见的树丛中找到了栖息之地。

"I wish we could always feel like this. Just living. Not hiding. Not being afraid." Shinji said as he squeezed Asuka's shoulder. Asuka could remember when piloting Eva was her life how she couldn't imagine living without it. But now she couldn't wait for this war to be over so she could really **live.** She knew Shinji was the same, he had only piloted because he had lived life adrift doing what others told him in the vain hope they would be kind or at least not cruel.  
"我希望我们能一直这样感觉。只是活着。不用躲藏。不用害怕。" 真嗣说着，紧握了明日香的肩膀。明日香记得驾驶 Eva 曾是她的全部生活，那时她无法想象没有它的生活。但现在，她迫不及待地希望这场战争结束，这样她才能真正地活。她知道真嗣也是一样，他只是因为漂泊无依，按照别人的指示行事，徒劳地希望他们会仁慈，或者至少不会残忍。

His prior timidity and shyness caused by a desire to not make things worse by voicing his thoughts lest they make the world hate him. Neither had really had anything to live for, not until they found each other. Though the side-effect was that that made their exceedingly lethal job almost unbearable. At least without moments like these.  
他之前的胆怯和羞涩，是因为不想通过表达自己的想法而使事情变得更糟，以免世界因此而憎恨他。两人之前都没有真正活下去的理由，直到他们找到了彼此。尽管这种副作用使得他们极度致命的工作几乎难以忍受。至少没有像这样的时刻。

"No matter what happens out there, I love you." Asuka said as she placed a tender kiss on his lips as her mind wished this moment would never end.  
"无论外面发生什么，我爱你。" 明日香说着，温柔地吻了他的唇，心中希望这一刻永远不会结束。

But already the sky was beginning to change colors. The blue of the sky was being replaced by the dark orange and red of dusk, with a tad of purple and pink on the clouds overhead. So, the lovers put theirs clothes back on, gathered their things, and leaving separately took different paths back to the Katsuragi apartment making a few stops on the way to run errands or just throw off any would- be followers. By nightfall it was as if they had never been in that cove at all.  
但天空的颜色已经开始变化。蔚蓝的天空正逐渐被黄昏的深橙与红色所取代，云朵上还点缀着些许紫罗兰和粉红。于是，恋人们重新穿好衣服，收拾好物品，分开离去，各自沿着不同的路径返回葛城公寓，途中顺便处理一些杂事或试图甩掉可能的跟踪者。到了夜晚，仿佛他们从未去过那个海湾一般。

**A/N:** So, as I said in the beginning this is just a special, an idea I've been tossing around in my head now that Summer has started, and people are spending more time outside and going on picnics. It is shorter than previous entries and is definitely WAFF heavy, and also Lemony but that's par for the course here; and judging by my story notes for episodes 20 to EoE uh you're going to need some because I'm going for realism, or what I consider realistic based on the lore and character motivations, over the sunshine and rainbows ending. Because I want to be true to the original message of Evangelion, you have to pick life, no matter what it may be bring.  
作者笔记：如前所述，这是一个特别的想法，随着夏季的开始，人们更多地外出和野餐，这个念头就在我脑海中盘旋。它比之前的篇章要短，绝对是温馨甜蜜的风格，同时也带有一点苦涩，但在这里这是常态；根据我对第 20 集到最终回的故事笔记来看，你们可能需要一些心理准备，因为我追求的是基于背景设定和角色动机的现实主义，而非阳光彩虹般的结局。因为我希望忠于《新世纪福音战士》的原始信息，无论生活带来什么，你都必须选择它。

Also, apologies if there are more grammar mistakes than usual, I tried the "Alcohol Inspiration" route for some of these sections. I really need an editor or something.  
另外，若文中出现比平时更多的语法错误，敬请谅解，我在撰写部分章节时尝试了“酒精灵感”的方式。我确实需要一位编辑或类似的帮助。

### Chapter 10 To Be Human

**Conference Room: The day after Zeruel's Attack  
会议室：零尔攻击后的第二天**

"The cost to repair the damage done to headquarters, the Evas, and the associated delays to our other plans is immense." The red-lit member of SEELE said as the members of the Human Instrumentality Committee, sans Gendo, met to discuss the previous day's battle in a room almost as dark as their mood.  
"修复总部、Eva 以及由此导致的其他计划延误所产生的损失是巨大的。" SEELE 的红灯成员说道，人类补完委员会的成员们（除碇之外）在一个几乎与他们心情一样阴暗的房间里开会，讨论前一天的战斗。

"It's truly a miracle the damage wasn't worse if the preliminary reports are accurate." The green-lit member said thumbing through the sheaves of data that had been relayed to them by their numerous sources and channels.  
"如果初步报告准确的话，损失没有更严重确实是个奇迹。" 绿灯成员说着，翻阅着通过他们众多渠道传递来的大量数据。

"Be that as it may the loss is still considerable, and he will have to answer for it." The blue-lit member almost spat out the bitter words as an image of a bearded man with steepled hands materialized at the empty head of the table.  
"尽管如此，损失依然惨重，他必须为此负责。" 蓝灯成员几乎咬牙切齿地说出这些苦涩的话，一个留着胡须、双手合十的男子影像在桌子空着的首位上显现。

"Ikari, explain." Chairman Lorenz Keel demanded of the Supreme Commander of NERV.  
"碇，解释一下。" 洛伦兹主席对 NERV 最高指挥官碇源堂命令道。

"The Angel was defeated." Gendo Ikari said simply from behind his customarily folded hands.  
"使徒已被击败。" 碇源堂简单地回答，双手一如既往地交叠在背后。

"That's all you have to say?!" The blue-lit member, always the most confrontational with Gendo almost roared at the seemingly indefatigable Ikari.  
"你就只有这些可说的吗？！" 那位总是与碇源堂针锋相对的蓝光成员，几乎是对着看似无懈可击的碇源堂咆哮起来。

"Not a single Eva Unit remains combat effective!" The yellow-lit member added, his tone one of anger as well, as he joined the fusillade against the NERV commander.  
“没有一个 EVA 单位保持战斗能力！”那位被黄色灯光照亮的成员补充道，他的语气同样充满愤怒，加入了对 NERV 指挥官的抨击。

"Victory costs what it costs. The alternative is extinction." Gendo said coolly to try and calm the situation, though his palms never moved from their guarded position. "Attrition has always been factored in to the scenario." He added after the members remained silent for a moment, pondering his words.  
“胜利的代价就是代价。另一种选择是灭绝。”碇源堂冷静地说道，试图平息局势，尽管他的手掌始终保持在防御的位置。“消耗战一直是我们计划中考虑的因素。”在成员们沉默片刻，思索他的话后，他补充道。

'Ours or yours.' Lorenz Keel thought at that moment but did not voice this doubt to Ikari directly.  
“我们的还是你们的。”洛伦兹·基尔在这一刻心中暗想，但没有直接向碇源堂表达这一疑虑。

"There is a difference between attrition and recklessness Ikari." The green-lit member warned Gendo with a stern look on his face.  
“碇，消耗与鲁莽是有区别的。”绿光成员严肃地警告着碇，脸上带着严厉的表情。

"Even so the Eva's performed well and the battle was a success." Gendo said seemingly unphased by the hidden and blatant hostility of the committee.  
“即便如此，EVA 的表现依然出色，战斗取得了成功。”碇似乎对委员会隐晦和明显的敌意无动于衷地说道。

"If you call two-thirds of the Eva force achieving Godhood, that have the potential to ruin all our plans in an instant, every time they are activated, success." The blue-lit member said, still indignant over this fact weeks later, though he gave voice to the thoughts of all the SEELE members in that moment. It sat uneasy with them having to rely on these Units, but there was no choice.  
“如果你把三分之二的 EVA 部队达到神格化，每次激活都可能瞬间破坏我们所有计划的情况称为成功。”蓝光成员说道，尽管几周后他仍对此事实感到愤愤不平，但那一刻他表达了所有 SEELE 成员的想法。依赖这些 EVA 单位让他们感到不安，但别无选择。

"That has been the case for some time now and I am assured the threat is benign." Gendo said trying to defuse the situation, though it still seemed not even a hair moved on his impassive body and if it wasn't for the sound of his voice one would think not even his lips moved.  
“这种情况已经持续了一段时间，我确信威胁是良性的。”源堂说道，试图缓和局势，尽管他的无动于衷的身体似乎连一根头发都没动，如果不是他的声音，人们会以为他的嘴唇甚至都没动。

"While it is true they have sortied twice so far without incident that is no guarantee for the future." The green-lit member cautioned as he remembered the fate that had befallen Units 03 and 04.  
“虽然到目前为止他们已经两次出击且未发生事故，但这并不能保证未来。”那位绿光照射下的成员警告道，他想起了 03 号和 04 号机组的命运。

"Prioritize repairing Unit-00. Our orders placing it as the designated vanguard still stand." Chairman Keel said, cutting through the debate and accusations with firm decision.  
“优先修复 00 号机。我们将其指定为先锋的命令依然有效。”基尔议长坚定地打断了争论和指责。

"Understood." Gendo Ikari said as his form dematerialized as quickly as it had come, leaving the Committee members alone.  
"明白了。" 碇源堂的身影如同来时一般迅速地消散，留下委员会成员们独自面对。

"I don't like it. Too much has gone awry with the scenario." The yellow-lit member said as he voiced his concerns to the committee.  
"我不喜欢这样。太多事情偏离了剧本。" 黄色灯光下的成员向委员会表达了他的担忧。

"We should have put a bell around his neck!" The blue-lit member stated heatedly.  
"我们早该在他脖子上挂个铃铛！" 蓝色灯光下的成员激动地说道。

"A bell was there. But it didn't ring." The red-lit member said matter-of-factly.  
“那里有个铃铛。但它没响。”红光照耀下的成员平淡地说道。

"A bell that doesn't ring has no purpose. We'll make sure the bell works next time." Chairman Lorenz Keel said, his tone growing harsh.  
“一个不响的铃铛毫无用处。我们下次会确保铃铛能正常工作。”洛伦兹·基尔主席说道，语气变得严厉。

**Gendo's Esoteric Office: Less than an hour later  
源堂的秘室：不到一小时后**

"My, my!" Ryoji Kaji said as he looked at the broken glass covering the kabbalah that decorated Gendo Ikari's office as he surveyed the damage to the Geofront now apparent with the coming of day. Scorched blast marks, toppled buildings, wrecked, burned out carcasses of equipment worth millions, and the innumerable cratered footprints that dotted the entire subterranean area. "So how did you explain all of this to the committee, I mean to SEELE?" The spy said, he had used his credentials as UN Inspector to get this meeting with NERV's leaders as they couldn't reasonably deny him after an Angel attack of this magnitude.  
"哎呀呀！"碇源堂办公室内，加持良治看着装饰着卡巴拉的破碎玻璃，目光随着晨光洒落，映照出地表的惨状。焦黑的爆炸痕迹、倾覆的建筑、价值连城的设备残骸被烧得面目全非，以及遍布整个地下区域的无数弹坑。"那么，你是怎么向委员会，我是说 SEELE，解释这一切的呢？"间谍问道，他利用联合国监察员的身份，在如此规模的天使袭击后，与 NERV 高层会面，他们无法合理拒绝。

Kaji is seen by many who know him as an enigma. But really though he's quite simple, he's just seeking the truth for its own sake. To that end he works under the auspice of UN Inspector, ostensibly for SEELE, though he did begin to work for Gendo when it became clear to him that he wasn't going to get anywhere further in their organization. Hence why he stole Adam from under SEELE's noses in an attempt to get closer to the truth in the hope that Gendo would reveal it. But alas that has yet to happen and Kaji is experiencing the same stonewalling he had with the Committee. All the while Kaji was still turning over stones and working with contacts in Japanese Intelligence, the "moonlighting" that had made him unwelcome in NERV headquarters for most of the time except now.  
在认识他的人眼中，加持良治是个谜。但实际上，他相当简单，只是为了追求真相本身。为此，他以联合国监察员的身份，表面上为 SEELE 工作，尽管他确实在意识到在 SEELE 组织中无法更进一步后，开始为碇源堂效力。这就是为什么他从 SEELE 眼皮底下偷走了亚当，试图更接近真相，希望碇源堂会透露出来。但遗憾的是，这一刻尚未到来，加持在委员会那里也遭遇了同样的阻碍。与此同时，加持仍在翻查线索，与日本情报部门的联系人合作，这种“兼职”使他在 NERV 总部大部分时间都不受欢迎，除了现在。

"We are not responsible for the actions of the enemy." Vice Commander Kozo Fuyutsuki stated, as he stood to the side of a seated Gendo in his imposing desk.  
“我们不对敌人的行为负责。”副司令冬月耕造说道，他站在坐在威严办公桌旁的碇源堂旁边。

"And the actions of berserker Evas?" Kaji said as he remembered the incident with the 12th Angel and its two S2 organs that had SEELE in an uproar, that still bubbled just below the surface.  
“那狂暴 EVA 的行为呢？”加持说道，他想起了第 12 使徒及其两个 S2 机关引发的事件，那次事件让 SEELE 陷入轩然大波，至今余波未平。

"It is human nature to seek to ascribe blame." Gendo said from his traditional guarded pose that managed to unsettle even the seasoned spy.  
"归咎于人是人之常情。" 碇源堂以他那传统的戒备姿态说道，这种姿态甚至让经验丰富的间谍也感到不安。

"I guess they don't understand it any more than we do." Kaji sighed as he turned around, broken glass crunching under his foot. "And the pilots?" Kaji asked, trying to gauge Gendo's response. Silence hung for a moment before Gendo answered:  
"我想他们和我们一样，并不真正理解。" 加持叹了口气，转身时脚下破碎的玻璃嘎吱作响。"那驾驶员们呢？" 加持问道，试图揣摩碇源堂的反应。沉默片刻后，碇源堂回答道：

"They serve their function. For now."  
"他们目前发挥着作用。"

**The Katsuragi Apartment: Some Days Later  
葛城公寓：数日后**

Asuka Langley Sohryu was lying face down on her pillow in her bedroom. Her mind wandering as it often did when she was alone. It was interrupted though by the irritating ring of the apartment's phone that with a sigh Asuka got up to retrieve. Listening to the voice on the other end before responding:  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷正面朝下趴在自己的枕头上，卧室里只有她一人。她的思绪常常在独处时飘散，但这次却被公寓电话那恼人的铃声打断。明日香叹了口气，起身去接电话，听完对方的话后回应道：

"Okay Misato, I'll tell the baka when he gets back from the store." Asuka said before hanging up the phone.  
“好吧，美里，等那个笨蛋从店里回来我会告诉他的。”明日香说完便挂断了电话。

Shinji had gone to the store by himself to do their grocery shopping since they worried that them going to too many places together would start to raise eyebrows at Section 2.  
真嗣独自去商店买菜，因为他们担心一起去太多地方会引起第二课的注意。

Soon enough the brown-haired boy returned. Sweaty and hot from the trek he unceremoniously dumped his schoolbag next to the pile of shoes by the doorway and went to the kitchen, placing the plastic bags on the kitchen table and letting out a sigh before he felt the lithe hands around his waist that told him she'd snuck up on him again.  
不久，棕色头发的男孩回来了。长途跋涉让他满头大汗，他随意地将书包扔在门口的鞋堆旁，走进厨房，把塑料袋放在餐桌上，叹了口气，然后感觉到纤细的手臂环住了他的腰，告诉他她又悄悄靠近了他。

"Asuka-!" Shinji was silenced as his redheaded lover covered his lips in a kiss, filled with passion, and what he knew was a hint of desperation. He'd gone straight to the store after school, so he was still in his uniform while Asuka was in her preferred tank top and shorts as their bodies melted into each other. She soon though broke the kiss and brought her mouth to his ear:  
“明日香！”真嗣被他的红发恋人用一个充满激情和一丝绝望的吻堵住了嘴。他放学后直接去了商店，所以还穿着校服，而明日香则穿着她喜欢的背心和短裤，两人的身体紧紧相拥。她很快结束了亲吻，将嘴凑到他的耳边：

"Misato won't be back until seven." Asuka whispered what she'd learned less than half an hour ago over the phone. the implication of this statement clear by her sultry tone and the fact that she'd draped herself over him with her right leg between his.  
"美里要到七点才会回来。" 半小时前通过电话得知这一消息的明日香低声说道，她的暗示通过她撩人的语调和将右腿搭在他身上的动作显而易见。

"Well, I need to start…" Shinji began only for Asuka to cover his mouth with another kiss. "…cooking…" Shinji managed between kisses as he too joined in the passion with his hands darting over her "…in an hour then." He finished as his mouth went to softly nimble at her neck.  
"嗯，我得开始……" 真嗣刚开口，就被明日香用另一个吻堵住了嘴。"……做饭……" 真嗣在接吻间隙勉强说道，他的手也开始加入激情，游走在她的……"……那一个小时后再开始吧。" 他结束道，嘴轻轻地在她脖子上轻咬。

"Plenty of time." Asuka nearly gasped as Shinji's touch sent goosebumps across her arms and legs.  
"时间充裕。" 明日香几乎喘不过气来，真嗣的触碰让她手臂和腿上起了鸡皮疙瘩。

Usually, Asuka liked a little more foreplay, but for reasons she didn't really understand ever since she and Shinji had been together her lust went into overdrive after an Angel attack. Maybe it was the after-effects on her hormones of all the adrenaline that had saturated her bloodstream. That primal link in human physiology between violence and sex. Or perhaps it was the result of her subconscious reminding her that she and the man she loved were mortal, and though they had cheated the reaper this time, the next time, and there would be a next time, they would not be so lucky.  
通常，明日香喜欢多一些前戏，但自从她和真嗣在一起后，她发现自己每次与使徒战斗后，欲望都会异常高涨。或许是因为大量肾上腺素充斥血液后对荷尔蒙的影响，那种人类生理上暴力与性之间的原始联系。又或许是因为她的潜意识在提醒她，她和心爱的男人都是凡人，虽然这次侥幸逃脱了死神的魔爪，但下一次，总会有下一次，他们未必会如此幸运。

Whatever the reason, the German redhead was in full nymphomaniac mode. And since today was the first time they'd had any serious length of time to themselves since battling Zeruel she would not waste the chance.  
不管原因是什么，这位德国红发女孩已经完全进入了性欲亢奋的状态。而且今天是他们自与零使徒战斗以来第一次有足够长的时间独处，她绝不会错过这个机会。

Deftly moving past a warmwater penguin snoring in a bean bag chair with three empty beer cans strewn about they made their way towards Asuka's room, their hands and lips still all over the other as the sliding door parted and then closed behind them, encasing them in the one place they could be themselves.  
他们灵巧地绕过一只躺在豆袋椅上打着呼噜的热水企鹅，周围散落着三个空啤酒罐，手牵手、唇贴唇地向明日香的房间走去。随着滑动门的开启与关闭，他们被封闭在这个唯一能让他们做回自己的空间里。

Now Shinji took control and he not-quite-pushed, not-quite-laid Asuka onto the bed as he perched himself on top of her. They stayed like that for what seemed like an eternity as their eyes stared into each other conveying the need they each had for the other in a moment of eye contact before their eyelids closed and their lips meant for another passionate kiss as Shinji's hand went to Asuka's midriff and pulled up her tank top so that the fabric of her tank top scrunched up under her breasts.  
此刻，真嗣掌控了局面，他既未完全推开，也未完全躺下，而是将明日香轻轻放倒在床上，自己则栖身于她之上。他们就这样凝视着彼此，仿佛时间凝固，眼神中传递着彼此深切的渴望。在眼睑缓缓闭合之际，他们的唇瓣再度相迎，准备献上又一次激情的热吻。真嗣的手探向明日香的腰际，轻轻向上拉起她的背心，使得衣料在她胸下皱成一团。

He stopped kissing her lips and began kissing her stomach, that while it did have muscles, they were not very pronounced, leaving it one alabaster surface. He went slowly, for about five seconds, before he went for the spots on her belly that he knew were erogenous in the extreme.  
他停止了唇间的亲吻，转而开始亲吻她的腹部。虽然那里有着肌肉，但并不明显，留下一片如白玉般的平滑肌肤。他缓缓地吻着，大约持续了五秒钟，然后转向她腹部那些他深知极为敏感的部位。

Her legs kicking and stomach muscles spasming seemingly uncontrollably as his tongue made circles around her navel filling her with a sensation that was like a mixture of being tickled and aroused at the same time.  
她的双腿踢动，腹肌不由自主地痉挛，他的舌头在她肚脐周围画着圈，带给她的感觉既像是被逗弄，又像是被激起情欲，两种感受交织在一起。

"Stop…that…baka!" Asuka said between spurts of uncontrollable giggling as she tugged at Shinji's brown hair until he finally acceded her request and she sat up, her hands going to the hem of her tank top.  
"住…手…笨蛋！" 明日香在无法控制的咯咯笑声中说道，她拉扯着真嗣的棕色头发，直到他最终顺从了她的请求，她才坐起身来，双手伸向自己的背心下摆。

She'd not bothered to put a bra on underneath, a fact he'd noticed when his hands were dashing over her body moments ago, yet he still was rendered speechless as he saw the sight of her bare breasts swinging back and forth from the motion of removing her top. The creamy white orbs with their brown nipples standing at attention in evidence of his lover's arousal.  
她并没有费心在背心下穿胸罩，这是他刚才双手在她身上游走时注意到的事实，然而当他看到她脱下背心时那对赤裸的乳房随着动作前后摆动时，他仍然哑口无言。那对乳白色的圆球，顶端的棕色乳头因爱人的兴奋而挺立。

"You're staring again pervert." Asuka teased, though jokingly as she swung her bust seductively while she said the words.  
"你又在盯着看了，变态。" 明日香打趣道，虽然是以开玩笑的口吻，但她在说这话时故意摇晃着自己的胸部，显得十分诱人。

"They're just so beautiful." Shinji said as his hand reached out and cupped her left tit. Massaging it gently in his palm while his index finger and thumb twisted and excited her nipple.  
"它们真是太美了。" 真嗣说着，手伸出去轻轻握住她的左乳，掌心温柔地揉捏着，同时用食指和拇指挑逗她的乳头。

Asuka bit her bottom lip to suppress a moan as she closed her eyes: 'He really does know all my buttons doesn't he.' She thought as her eyes opened and she gazed into his cobalt eyes.  
明日香咬住下唇，强忍住呻吟，闭上眼睛：'他真的知道我所有的敏感点，不是吗。' 她想着，睁开眼，凝视着他那深邃的钴蓝色眼睛。

"Oh, so you're just interested in my boobs, typical man." She teased, her voice, gaining some of its usual fire.  
"哦，所以你只对我的胸部感兴趣，典型的男人。" 她调侃道，声音中恢复了几分往日的活力。

"That's not what I said." He said calmly as he stared into her cerulean eyes. Their faces unconsciously inching towards each other until Shinji lunged his face forward those last few millimeters and their lips connected.  
"我不是那个意思。" 他平静地说道，凝视着她那蔚蓝的眼睛。两人的脸不自觉地靠近，直到真嗣向前倾身，最后几毫米的距离，他们的唇瓣相触。

"You didn't brush your teeth." Asuka said, just now noticing this fact, somehow, despite all the other kisses they'd shared in the last five minutes. Her contented smile never left her face though.  
"你没刷牙。" 明日香说道，尽管在过去的五分钟里他们已经亲吻了多次，她现在才注意到这个事实。然而，她满意的笑容始终未曾消失。

"I got distracted." Shinji said as his excuse. His hands groping both her orange sized mounds in his hands to accentuate the point.  
"我分心了。" 真嗣找了个借口。他的双手摸索着她那橙子大小的双峰，以此强调他的理由。

"Touché." She said, smiling through a wince, as Shinji's fingernail went across her nipple a bit too roughly.  
"触到痛处了。" 她带着一丝痛苦的微笑说道，因为真嗣的指甲过于粗鲁地划过了她的乳头。

"Sorry." Shinji said as he realized what he'd done, the smile leaving his face.  
"对不起。" 真嗣意识到自己的行为后说道，脸上的笑容消失了。

'Oh no you don't.' Asuka thought as her mind thought of a lewd way to restore the mood. Grabbing each of Shinji's hands she dragged him to his feet on the side of her bed. Without missing a beat, she started unbuckling his belt, the black school pants dropping in a heap around his ankles, while a suspicious bulge was revealed to be residing under his boxers.  
'哦，你休想。' 明日香心想，她的脑海中浮现出一个淫秽的方法来恢复气氛。她抓住真嗣的双手，将他拉到床边站起。她毫不犹豫地开始解开他的腰带，黑色的校裤在他脚踝处堆成一团，而他的内裤下则显露出一个可疑的隆起。

"Your rhetoric is getting better, I think the baka deserves a reward for that." Asuka said rather, well more like downright suggestively, as her nimble fingers tucked under the hem of his blue boxers and pulled them down to join his pants.  
“你的口才越来越好了，我觉得这个笨蛋值得奖励一下。”明日香说道，语气中带着几分挑逗，她灵巧的手指勾住他蓝色内裤的边缘，将其连同裤子一起拉下。

The action revealed Shinji's member in all its glory, mirroring the swinging of Asuka's bust earlier when it as well was released from the constricting confines of clothes.  
这一动作让真嗣的私处完全展露，与之前明日香胸部从衣物束缚中解放出来时的摇摆相映成趣。

Asuka took the cock in her right hand as her left went to massage Shinji's bulging balls. Her tongue soon went to the tip of his rock-hard erection and licked the slit there before taking the cockhead in her mouth swirling her tongue around the hard fleshy bulge before removing it and then placing light kisses on the underside of his shaft. Lifting it up so that it was between her eyes as she looked up at the glazed over eyes of her lover.  
明日香用右手握住那根阴茎，左手则去按摩真嗣鼓起的睾丸。她的舌头很快移到他坚硬勃起的顶端，舔舐着那里的裂口，然后将龟头含入口中，舌头绕着坚实的肉质隆起旋转，随后移开，轻轻吻着他的阴茎下方。她将它抬起，使其位于她的双眼之间，抬头凝视着她爱人那双迷离的眼睛。

Satisfied that he was now putty in her hands she took him in her mouth again this time also sucking at his shaft rather than just the tip. Taking in about half his length with each motion she made.  
她满意地感觉到他已经完全被她掌控，于是再次将他含入口中，这次不仅吸吮着他的龟头，还连带着他的阴茎。每次动作都吞入他大约一半的长度。

She'd only just begun but already he felt so close, it'd been days since he'd had any kind of release. He'd been so tired with all the battle debriefings, mental and medical checks, and other tedium that followed the days after an Angel attack to even have time for lefty and righty, truly a man's worst nightmare. A part in the back of his mind also knew Asuka was also aching for release, otherwise she wouldn't have pounced on him the moment he got home.  
她才刚刚开始，但他已经感觉快要到达极限了，毕竟他已经好几天没有得到任何释放。战斗后的汇报、心理和医疗检查，以及其他在使徒袭击后的那些日子里接踵而至的繁琐事务让他疲惫不堪，甚至连左手和右手的时间都没有，这简直是男人的噩梦。他内心深处也知道明日香同样渴望释放，否则她不会一回家就扑向他。

But that thought was a whisper in the storm of blissful agony Shinji was in, as his cock felt like it was going to burst at any moment as he desperately tried to keep from cumming just a second longer.  
但这个念头在真嗣所处的极乐痛苦风暴中只是微弱的耳语，他的阴茎感觉随时都会爆发，他拼命试图再坚持一秒钟不射出来。

Asuka gave one more bob of her head before removing her mouth from his cock though her hands continued their motions. Had Shinji had his eyes open he would have seen that Asuka was about to say something, a snide remark or some such, when she got a surprise. Several spurts of hot white cum, covered her neck, from her chin down to her sternum. The thick liquid beginning to flow down her chest to just the top curve of her breasts before losing momentum.  
明日香又轻轻点了下头，才从他的阴茎上移开嘴唇，尽管她的手仍在继续动作。如果真嗣睁开眼睛，他会看到明日香正要开口说些什么，或许是句刻薄的评论，却突然遭遇了意外。几股滚烫的白色精液喷洒在她的脖颈上，从下巴一直覆盖到胸骨。那浓稠的液体开始顺着她的胸口流淌，直到在乳房上方的曲线处失去动力。

Shinji expected Asuka to be maybe a wee bit annoyed with him but instead he was surprised:  
真嗣本以为明日香可能会对他有点恼火，但结果却出乎他的意料：

"Huh, been a while hasn't it." Asuka said understandingly as she craned her head to try and get a look at what Shinji had done to her.  
“呵，好久没这样了吧。”明日香理解地说道，她扭过头试图看看真嗣对她做了什么。

Suddenly the thought from earlier that Asuka also was aching for release thrust into the forefront of Shinji's mind. Determined to give her that Shinji picked her up and placed her back on the bed. Not even giving her the time to wipe the cum off her chest as he tore her shorts off, together with her lacey red panties that he tossed off to the side. If he'd been more ceremonious about the whole thing, he'd have noticed the dark splotch Asuka's arousal had left on her underwear.  
突然间，早先想到明日香也在渴望解脱的念头猛地涌入真嗣的脑海。决心满足她的真嗣将她抱起，放回床上。甚至没给她时间擦拭胸前的精液，他便急切地扯下她的短裤，连同那条红色蕾丝内裤一起扔到一旁。如果他当时更细心些，就会注意到明日香情动时在内裤上留下的深色痕迹。

He silenced any protests that Asuka may have had with a passionate kiss to her lips as his hands went to her breasts, kneading them furiously while his thumbs excited her nipples. A soft moan, more a whimper really, from Asuka was all the encouragement Shinji needed to continue.  
他用一个充满激情的吻封住了明日香可能发出的任何抗议，双手则移向她的乳房，用力揉捏，同时用拇指刺激她的乳头。明日香发出一声轻柔的呻吟，更像是低声的啜泣，这足以鼓励真嗣继续下去。

He broke the kiss, his hands relocating to her knees to open up her legs, which they did easily and exposed her sex. Every time Shinji looked at the hairless mound it never ceased to amaze him. Sometimes there was only the bare whisper of a slit between her pale labia, sometimes her clit or inner lips would poke out, and others like now he could even clearly see her hole, uncovered by her pussy's folds.  
他结束了这个吻，双手移到她的膝盖，轻松地分开她的双腿，露出了她的私处。每次真嗣看到那片无毛的小丘，都不禁感到惊奇。有时那里只有一条几乎看不见的细缝，有时她的阴蒂或内唇会微微突出，而有时就像现在，他甚至能清晰地看到她的穴口，未被阴唇的皱褶遮掩。

'Baka's staring again.' Asuka's more rational, prideful side told her. 'Shut up.' Asuka's hormones replied.  
“笨蛋又在盯着看了。”明日香那更为理性、骄傲的一面告诉她。“闭嘴。”明日香的荷尔蒙回应道。

Her hormonal urges weren't kept waiting long as Shinji soon got to work. He began by kissing her leg, starting from her knee, and placing special attention on her sensitive inner thigh, sending a jolt of electricity through the redhead that threatened another round of goosebumps. Before at last his lips and tongue reached her most private place. He Started with kisses around her labia, before opening them up his thumbs to get at her more delicate lips and clit. His tongue alternating between piercing into her wet hole and ferociously darting back and forth and up and down and circling around the sensitive nub above.  
她的荷尔蒙冲动并未等待太久，因为真嗣很快就开始行动了。他首先从亲吻她的腿开始，从膝盖开始，特别关注她敏感的大腿内侧，这股电流让红发女孩几乎又要起一身鸡皮疙瘩。最终，他的唇舌到达了她最私密的地方。他先是亲吻她的阴唇周围，然后用拇指分开，触及她更为娇嫩的唇瓣和阴蒂。他的舌头在她湿润的小穴中穿刺，又猛烈地在上方敏感的小豆豆周围来回、上下、环绕地挑逗。

His face felt the heat that was coming out of Asuka's insides, that felt to Shinji like his face was next to a stove rather than his lover. Her juices flowing down his face before slowly dripping off his chin onto her sheets.  
真嗣的脸感受到了从明日香体内散发出的热气，对他来说，这感觉就像脸贴在炉子旁而非爱人身边。她的体液顺着他的脸流下，慢慢从他的下巴滴落到她的床单上。

If the building heat in Asuka's belly was intense for Shinji it was torturous for Asuka. It felt as if her insides were on fire, begging for just that one last hurdle to go over the edg-…Oh! Fuck that's it!  
如果那股在明日香腹中的燥热对真嗣来说是强烈的，那么对明日香而言则是折磨。她感觉自己的内脏仿佛在燃烧，渴望着那最后一道障碍的跨越，越过边缘……哦！该死，就是这样！

Her breath croaked and her hips and back arched in the air as that threshold was finally crossed as Shinji's fingers replaced his tongue and attacked the wrinkly and sensitive folds of her hole.  
她的呼吸变得嘶哑，臀部和背部在空中弯曲，当真嗣的手指取代了他的舌头，攻击她那褶皱而敏感的洞口时，那个临界点终于被突破了。

Panting heavily as she came down from her high, her chest heaving causing the splotches and threads of cum on her neck to seemingly dance. As her mind slowly came back to reality, she became aware of Shinji's erect-again cockhead stroking her lower lips with a seemingly feathery touch. Shinji coating his lower head with her wetness as he lowered his lips to hers and they shared a deep kiss as Asuka's body readied itself for another round in the throes of passion.  
她气喘吁吁地从高潮中平复下来，胸部剧烈起伏，使得她脖子上那些斑点和精液的痕迹仿佛在跳动。随着她的意识逐渐回归现实，她察觉到真嗣再次勃起的阴茎头正以近乎羽毛般的轻触抚弄着她的下唇。真嗣用她的湿润涂抹着自己的阴茎头，同时俯身与她深吻，明日香的身体为下一场激情的风暴做好了准备。

Shinji's member slid into her easily, his shaft brushing against her sensitive folds as he slowly hilted himself into her, giving her body time to adjust. He felt the tip of his cock touch what he called her "bottom" and what science called her cervix. Asuka felt that comforting sense of fullness and his weight on top of her and she found his tongue with hers, its enthusiasm conveying to Shinji her desire.  
真嗣的阴茎轻松地滑入她体内，他的肉棒轻触她敏感的褶皱，缓缓深入，让她有时间适应。他感觉到自己的龟头触碰到了他称之为“底部”的地方，也就是科学上所说的子宫颈。明日香感受到了那种令人安心的充实感和他压在自己身上的重量，她用舌头找到了他的，他的热情传递给了真嗣她的渴望。

He grabbed her hands in his and guided them, so they were above her head as he began to slowly pull out his cock from her insides only to return again. Shinji built up a rhythm of long deep strokes, pulling his cock almost all the way out of her, leaving only the head in before pushing his entire length back into her again and bottoming her out with each stroke.  
他抓住她的手，引导它们放在她的头顶，然后开始慢慢从她体内抽出他的阴茎，随即又重新插入。真嗣建立了一种节奏，长而深的抽插，几乎完全抽出，只留下龟头在内，然后再次将整根插入，每次都深深顶入。

She felt his shaft brush against her wrinkly, wet folds. His actions rekindling the inferno that had so recently been sated yet still would burn as hot as ever. Their tongues as well as danced together in their kisses as both her pairs of lips played host to her lover.  
她感觉到他的肉棒轻触她湿润、皱褶的阴唇。他的动作重新点燃了刚刚得到满足却又依旧炽热的欲火。他们的舌头在亲吻中交缠，她的双唇也迎接着爱人的触碰。

But at the next stroke Shinji also furiously shoved his tongue into her mouth, subduing her own and exploring her mouth unhindered. Now both her pussy and her mouth were completely filled and dominated by those appendages that so frequently brought her pleasure. This full penetration caused her to moan, as much as circumstances would allow, and she gripped his hands as tight as her muscles would allow in response to the onslaught and he returned the gesture. The lovers seemingly wanting to grind the other's bones into powder.  
但在下一刻，真嗣也狂暴地将舌头伸入她的口中，压制住她的舌，毫无阻碍地探索她的口腔。现在，她的私处和嘴巴都被那些频繁带来快感的器官完全填满并支配。这种彻底的贯穿让她不禁呻吟，尽管环境所限，她还是尽可能地紧握他的手作为回应，而他亦以同样的力度回握。这对恋人似乎想要将对方的骨头碾成粉末。

However, Asuka was not one to just lie there and passively receive pleasure, she also wanted to give it. So she rolled her hips and closed her legs around him, tightening the walls around his shaft and ever so slightly lifted her ass up from the bed almost like she was trying to ride him. While simultaneously her tongue launched a counterattack and now it was Shinji's turn to have his lover's tongue explore his mouth.  
然而，明日香并非那种只会躺着被动接受快乐的人，她也想给予。于是她扭动臀部，双腿紧夹住他，紧缩围绕他阳具的壁垒，并微微抬起臀部，几乎像是要骑乘他一般。同时，她的舌头发起反攻，现在轮到真嗣体验被爱人舌头探索口腔的感觉了。

It never ceased to amaze Shinji how Asuka could be underneath yet still manage to be in the driver's seat. Her body convulsed again as her thighs pressed against Shinji's sides mirroring what the folds and creases of her pussy were doing to his cock.  
真嗣始终惊叹于明日香如何在下方仍能掌控全局。她的身体再次抽搐，大腿紧贴着真嗣的两侧，如同她私处的褶皱对真嗣的阴茎所做的那样。

Their hips began moving in synch. Both moving to maximize the contact between their bodies. The muffled moans and hitched breathing, the unique slapping sound of their flesh connecting filled Asuka's room with the sound of their lovemaking. Shinji could feel Asuka tightening around him, the heat and wetness of her pussy rivalling, maybe even surpassing, what his mouth and tongue felt earlier. Asuka could feel Shinji's balls tightening as she felt fewer wrinkles on her ass each time their hips connected. Both of them were so close.  
他们的臀部开始同步移动，双方都力求最大限度地接触彼此的身体。压抑的呻吟和急促的呼吸，以及他们肉体碰撞的独特声响，填满了明日香的房间，回荡着他们欢爱的声音。真嗣能感受到明日香紧裹着他，她阴部的热度和湿润或许甚至超越了之前他口舌所感受到的。明日香则感觉到真嗣的睾丸在收紧，每次臀部相撞时，她觉得臀部的皱纹在减少。两人都已临近高潮。

Asuka reached her peak first, her hips stopped moving for a moment as she felt her orgasm wash over her, breaking the kiss with Shinji so her lungs could take in needed air as her body shook beneath Shinji. He gave her a moment before he started moving again searching for his own release.  
明日香率先达到顶峰，她的臀部停顿片刻，感受着高潮的浪潮席卷全身，她与真嗣的吻也因此中断，以便呼吸急需的空气，她的身体在真嗣身下颤抖。真嗣给了她片刻时间，随后再次开始移动，寻找自己的释放。

Powerful, swift thrusts brushed past her tight walls until she felt the telltale twitching of his cock inside her followed by a spreading warmness as his balls emptied themselves into her. She wrapped her hands around his back and kissed his cheek. They stayed like that for a while before Shinji leaned up and exited her, his cock still stiff despite everything.  
强劲而迅速的冲击掠过她紧致的壁垒，直到她感受到他阴茎内传来的预示着高潮的颤动，紧接着是一股温暖的蔓延，他的精囊将精华倾泻入她体内。她双手环抱他的背部，亲吻他的脸颊。他们就这样相拥片刻，直到真嗣起身退出她的身体，尽管一切已结束，他的阴茎依旧坚挺。

He looked at the sight before him. Her toes and fingers curling and gripping the bedsheets as she calmed down and her breathing became normal. His viscous cum flowing down her labia and ass cheeks, as well as his earlier load still on her chest and neck, glistening with sweat from the heat and exertion. She knew Shinji was one who liked to see the results of his efforts and though it caused her cheeks to glow as bright red as her hair, she kept her legs where they were for a moment to let him soak in the view.  
他凝视着眼前的景象。她的脚趾和手指因平静下来而紧抓床单，呼吸恢复正常。他的粘稠精液沿着她的阴唇和臀部流淌，早前的痕迹仍留在她的胸部和颈部，在汗水与体温的映衬下闪着光泽。她知道真嗣喜欢看到自己努力的成果，尽管这让她双颊如发色般绯红，她还是保持双腿不动，让他尽情欣赏这一幕。

It was enough to make him go in again if only they had the time. But they did not. So, after a last few kisses Asuka went to clean herself off while Shinji belatedly put away the groceries he had brought home, before he himself also got cleaned before they both went to the kitchen to cook dinner.  
这足以让他再次投入，可惜他们没有时间。因此，在最后几个吻别后，明日香去清洗自己，而真嗣则迟来地收拾起带回家的杂货，随后也清洗干净，两人一同走进厨房准备晚餐。

They were making one of Misato's favorites. Tempura shrimp with steamed rice and vegetables. Asuka donned an apron as she cut the vegetables to place in the steamer while Shinji battered and fried the shrimp. The sounds of the bubbling oil and steaming water filling the kitchen as they worked in silence, seemingly preternaturally knowing how to avoid getting in the other's way. Soon the food was ready, but it was the only thing that was.  
他们正在做美里最喜欢的菜——天妇罗虾配蒸米饭和蔬菜。明日香系上围裙，切好蔬菜放入蒸笼，而真嗣则裹上面糊炸虾。厨房里回荡着油泡和蒸汽的声音，两人默默工作，仿佛天生就知道如何避免妨碍对方。很快，食物准备好了，但这似乎是唯一准备好的东西。

"Do we have to tell her?" Asuka asked as a sigh escaped her lips as she voiced the concern that had been building ever since she left the bliss of the bedroom behind and entered the kitchen.  
“我们非得告诉她吗？”明日香叹了口气，自从离开卧室的幸福，走进厨房以来，这个担忧一直在她心中积聚。

"Yes." Shinji said as he placed the last dish on the table.  
“是的。”真嗣说着，将最后一道菜摆上餐桌。

"But she already knows everything important, why not just leave it at that!" Asuka continued as Shinji placed Pen Pen's sardines in his bowl for when he woke from his drunken stupor, before the brown-haired boy turned and faced the German redhead, back straight and eyes confident as he spoke.  
"但她已经知道所有重要的事情了，为什么不就此打住呢！" 明日香继续说道，而真嗣则将 Pen Pen 的沙丁鱼放入他的碗中，等待他从醉酒的昏睡中醒来。随后，棕色头发的男孩转身面对德国红发女孩，背挺直，眼神自信地开口。

"You remember what it was like in there." It was a statement not a question though truth be told both of them had trouble fully remembering the details and nuance of being in the Shadow. Like trying to remember a dream from last week. "Why did they ask so much about us?"  
"你还记得那里的感觉。" 尽管这更像是一个陈述而非问题，但说实话，他们俩都难以完全回忆起在使徒体内的细节和微妙之处。就像试图回忆上周的梦境一样。"为什么他们对我们问得那么多？"

"Who cares?!" A nearly hysterical Asuka said, her hands gesticulating wildly.  
"谁在乎啊？！" 明日香近乎歇斯底里地说道，双手夸张地比划着。

"It's not just that it might be important." Shinji said as he came toward her and hugged her in a tight embrace, her head resting on his chest and her lithe fingers clenching at the fabric of his shirt like she was afraid he might vanish if she didn't hold on. "We can't hide forever."  
"这不仅仅是因为它可能很重要。" 真嗣边说边向她走来，紧紧地拥抱她，她的头靠在他的胸前，纤细的手指紧紧抓住他衬衫的布料，仿佛害怕一松手他就会消失。"我们不能永远躲藏。"

They had changed each other. They loved each other for that. Needed each other for that.  
他们改变了彼此。他们因此相爱，也因此需要彼此。

"I just can't lose you." Asuka said a moment later as she picked her head up to look into the eyes of the man Shinji had become. Gone was the uncertainty and passivity, eroded by love yet still his kindness and selflessness remained. Asuka's fire had made Shinji actually want to be alive rather than merely exist. '_**Vigor**_.' Asuka's mind absently told her what Shinji had gained.  
"我就是不能失去你。" 明日香片刻后抬起头，凝视着真嗣如今的样子。曾经的犹豫和被动已不复存在，被爱意磨砺，但他的善良和无私依旧。明日香的热情让真嗣真正渴望活下去，而非仅仅存在。'活力。' 明日香的心中不经意地告诉她，这是真嗣所获得的。

"And I you." Shinji said as he looked into the eyes of the woman Asuka had become. Still confident but deriving her worth from just being Asuka and not a pilot and being sure enough in herself to show care and frailty. His true affection had opened her eyes to the sham that was and showed her what true unconditional love is. '_**Tenderness**_.' Shinji's mind said mirroring Asuka's.  
"我也一样。" 真嗣说着，凝视着眼前这位已蜕变为成熟女性的明日香。她依旧自信，但这份价值源自她作为明日香本身，而非驾驶员身份，她对自己足够确信，以至于能展现出关怀与脆弱。真嗣的真挚情感揭开了她眼前的假象，让她见识到了何为真正的无条件爱。'温柔。' 真嗣心中默念，呼应着明日香的感受。

A flower can bloom in the dark, but if it isn't taken to the light, planted in the fertile soil and watered, it will wither and die without the world seeing its beauty. That is the fear at the back of their minds. Shinji sees it, Asuka doesn't want to see it. But they both know a relationship founded on secrecy, whose only pillar is passion, cannot endure.  
花朵能在黑暗中绽放，但若不将其移至阳光下，栽种于肥沃土壤并给予水分，它将在无人欣赏其美丽的情况下枯萎凋零。这是他们心底的恐惧。真嗣察觉到了，而明日香不愿面对。但他们都明白，建立在秘密之上、仅凭激情维系的关系，是无法长久的。

"I'm home!" The lovers heard Misato say as the front door hissed. They shared one last kiss, conveying with it all their love to the other and thanks for making them the person that they were before separating and greeting Misato:  
"我回来了！" 听到美里在前门发出的声音，这对恋人交换了最后一个吻，将所有的爱意与感激传递给对方，感谢彼此让他们成为现在的自己，然后分开，迎接美里：

"Hey Misato!" The two said at the same time, their synch training still milling about in their minds.  
"嘿，美里！" 两人异口同声地说道，同步训练的记忆仍在脑海中萦绕。

"Hey guys! Ah my favorite!" Misato said as she grabbed a beer from the fridge. "Ohh! That looks great on you Asuka!" Misato teased as she noticed Asuka removing her apron too late as the three of them sat down at the spread that Shinji had made.  
"嘿，伙计们！啊，我的最爱！" 美里说着从冰箱里抓出一罐啤酒。"哦！这对你来说太合适了，明日香！" 美里注意到明日香脱下围裙的动作太晚，三人便坐到了真嗣准备好的餐点前，她打趣道。

"Thanks Misato." Asuka responded rather halfheartedly and quietly to Misato's teasing. Which if Misato was less tired would have sounded alarm bells but instead, she just shrugged, opened her can of Yebisu and downed it in under ten seconds.  
"谢谢你，美里。" 明日香对美里的调侃回应得有些心不在焉且轻声细语。如果美里不那么疲惫，这可能会引起她的警觉，但她只是耸了耸肩，打开一罐惠比寿啤酒，不到十秒就喝了个精光。

"Ah Yeah!" The tired Misato exclaimed as she crushed the can in her hand, grabbed another one, and dug into the waiting food.  
“啊耶！”疲惫的美里大喊一声，将手中的罐子捏扁，又抓起另一罐，开始享用等待已久的食物。

The three ate in relative silence. Well Misato ate while the two pilots more poked at their food. Words were easy but the real test is when it is time for action.  
三人相对沉默地吃着。美里大口吃着，而两位驾驶员则更多是在拨弄食物。言语容易，但真正的考验在于行动时刻。

"Misato" Shinji finally began after a deep breath, "We never got to finish our conversation from earlier." He said as he felt Asuka put his hand in a vise-grip under the table and out of view of Misato. The NERV Major paused and looked at the ceiling for a moment, perhaps in the hope if her eyes had something bland and uninteresting to look at it would free more bandwidth for her brain.  
“美里”，真嗣终于在深呼吸后开口，“我们之前的话题还没聊完。”他说着，感觉到明日香在桌下紧紧握住了他的手，不让美里察觉。NERV 的作战部长停顿了一下，抬头望向天花板，或许希望目光所及的平淡无奇能腾出更多脑力来思考。

"Ah right" She said looking back at them while at the same time stuffing her face with another shrimp. "You said they were interested in the human condition." She said comically with her mouth full.  
"啊对了" 她边说边回头看向他们，同时又往嘴里塞了一只虾。"你们说他们对人类状况感兴趣。" 她嘴里塞满食物，滑稽地说道。

"Yes, though it seemed one specific part specifically." Asuka almost alliterated as her nervousness made her forget how much Japanese she knew.  
"是的，不过似乎是特别关注某一部分。" 明日香几乎是在重复自己的话，紧张让她忘记了多少日语。

"Well, what?" Misato asked growing a tad impatient with all this dancing around.  
"那么，是什么呢？" 美里问道，对这种绕弯子开始有点不耐烦了。

"Our relationship." The two lovers said in synch with each other as they brought their hands up and placed them on the table. Their guardian's eyes went wide, and it was a few moments before her mouth managed to form words.  
"我们的关系。" 两位恋人异口同声地说着，同时将手举起放在桌面上。他们的监护人眼睛瞪得大大的，过了好一会儿，她的嘴才勉强挤出话来。

"How fa-?" Misato tried to ask before Asuka cut her off with a response.  
"怎么可——？" 美里试图询问，但被明日香打断了。

"_**Completely**_." Asuka answered, the tone of her voice as she said the word leaving no doubt as to the extent of their relationship and that this was not a joke or a prank.  
"完全。" 明日香回答道，她的语气在说出这个词时，清楚地表明了他们关系的深度，并且这不是一个玩笑或恶作剧。

"Since Mt. Asama." Shinji added as he squeezed Asuka's hand, and they shared a look into each other's eyes as they braced themselves for what was coming.  
“自从浅间山以来。”真嗣补充道，同时紧握着明日香的手，两人对视一眼，准备迎接即将到来的事情。

Now Shinji and Asuka had prepared for all the ways they thought Misato would react. Going full commander mode and berating them, forbidding their union, immediately having Section 2 remand them to separate living spaces, but they never anticipated how she really did respond.  
现在，真嗣和明日香已经为所有他们认为美里可能的反应做好了准备。她可能会进入指挥官模式，严厉斥责他们，禁止他们在一起，立即让第二课将他们分开居住，但他们从未预料到她真正的反应。

Instead of all the fire and fury they had expected, Misato wordlessly sat there, like a deer in the headlights, her eyes seemingly glazed over, mouth agape. Asuka and Shinji glanced at each other nervously, Shinji extending a hand toward the silent Misato only for her to get up and walk outside of the apartment, the door hissing behind her as she left. A few moments later they faintly heard the distinct roar of her car's engine, and they were left wondering what all this meant.  
出乎他们意料的是，美里并没有表现出预期的愤怒和激烈，而是默默地坐在那里，像一只被车灯照到的鹿，眼神似乎呆滞，嘴巴微张。明日香和真嗣紧张地对视了一眼，真嗣伸出手试图接近沉默的美里，但她却起身走出了公寓，门在她身后嘶嘶作响。几秒钟后，他们隐约听到了她汽车引擎的轰鸣声，留下他们疑惑这一切意味着什么。

Misato meanwhile was speeding through the streets of Tokyo-3 in her Alpine, seemingly trying to break every traffic law and speed limit there was before her brain absently got an idea. She pulled her handbrake, sending her car into a screeching 180 degree turn before literally putting the pedal to the metal and heading toward the Geofront and NERV HQ.  
与此同时，美里正驾驶着她的阿尔派在第三新东京市的街道上疾驰，似乎试图打破所有交通法规和速度限制。突然，她的脑海中闪过一个念头。她猛地拉起手刹，让车子发出刺耳的 180 度急转弯声，然后一脚油门到底，直奔地底都市和 NERV 总部而去。

Once there she pored over Section 2's files and reports on Shinji and Asuka and realized they had no clue what was happening right under their noses.  
到达那里后，她仔细查阅了第二分部的关于真嗣和明日香的文件和报告，意识到他们对自己眼皮底下的情况一无所知。

'How?! How!?That makes no sense!' Misato thought before it dawned on her that really it did. Since they recruited the agents from the best of the best of the security detachments and bodyguards for politicians and businessmen. A job in which discretion was vital and where you don't ask or think about why the tycoon, you're protecting spends four hours in an apartment with a woman who isn't his wife, you just secure the perimeter.  
'怎么会？！怎么会？！这说不通啊！'美里心想，随即恍然大悟，其实这完全说得通。因为他们招募的特工都是从最优秀的安全部队和政商界保镖中挑选出来的。在这种工作中，保密至关重要，你不会去问或思考为什么你保护的富豪会在一个不是他妻子的女人家里待上四个小时，你只需要确保周边安全。

'NERV's only concern is that they can pilot. Beyond that they don't really care.' Misato thought as she had an epiphany about just how much of a cog the children were in the machine of the organization. How much she was just a cog…  
'NERV 唯一关心的是他们能否驾驶。除此之外，他们并不真正在意。' 美里在思考中突然领悟到这些孩子们在组织机器中是多么微不足道的一环。她自己又何尝不是……

She closed the files and reached into her jacket and fished out her phone. The device rang three times before it was answered.  
她合上文件，伸手从夹克里掏出手机。电话响了三声后被接起。

"Katsuragi." Ryoji Kaji said in greeting. "What's up?"  
"葛城。" 加持良治打招呼道。"怎么了？"

"Kaji." Misato began, her tone devoid of its usual life, "We need to talk."  
"加治。" 美里开口，语气失去了往日的活力，"我们需要谈谈。"

"I know a place." Kaji said. Instantly picking up on the disquiet in her voice. Dropping everything he agreed to meet her at a bar he knew that served a decent drink, and as an added bonus had many quiet corners for sensitive conversations.  
"我知道一个地方。" 加治说道，立刻察觉到她声音中的不安。他放下手头的一切，同意在一个他知道提供不错饮品的酒吧与她见面，而且这个酒吧还有许多安静的角落，适合敏感的对话。

They meet just shy of half an hour later, and at a corner table Misato told him everything, about what she'd figured out about the Eva's, Angels, and Shinji and Asuka.  
他们在大约半小时后见面，在一个角落的桌子旁，美里向他倾诉了一切，关于她对 EVA、使徒以及真嗣和明日香的了解。

"Well, we did say they'd be good together…it's just…a lot." Kaji said as he sipped his whisky on the rocks as his mind absorbed this new information.  
"嗯，我们确实说过他们会很般配……只是……这有点出乎意料。" 加持一边说着，一边啜饮着他的威士忌加冰，脑海中消化着这些新信息。

"They're just so young to be doing it all already." Misato said after she gulped down a shot of the sake she had ordered.  
"他们还这么年轻，就已经经历这么多事了。" 美里在喝下一杯她点的清酒后说道。

"They're also too young to be risking death as often as they are." Kaji pointed out as the ice in his tumbler clinked together as he swirled the drink in his hand while his eyes fixated on the ripples the spirit formed, perhaps thinking the truth could be found in them.  
"他们也太年轻了，却频繁地冒着生命危险。" 加持指出，手中的酒杯随着他摇晃的动作，冰块叮当作响，他的目光紧盯着酒液形成的波纹，或许在想真相就藏匿其中。

"None of this is fair." Misato said as she poured herself another round of sake and downed it quicker. 'All just cogs in the war machine.' Her mind told her as the alcohol failed to blur out that inconvenient notion.  
"这一切都不公平。" 美里边说边为自己又倒了一杯清酒，迅速一饮而尽。'我们不过是战争机器中的齿轮。' 酒精未能模糊掉这个令人不快的念头，她的内心如此告诉她。

"I guess it's only natural they found solace in each other." Kaji said as he gave up searching for the truth in his drink and instead looked for it in Misato's dark eyes. "That's what everyone does isn't it?" Kaji said as he forced lips to form his habitual smile.  
"我想他们彼此找到慰藉是再自然不过的事了。" 加持说着，放弃了在酒中寻找真相，转而凝视美里深邃的双眼。"大家不都是这样做的吗？" 加持强作笑颜，习惯性地牵动嘴角说道。

"Just worried they'll screw it up like we did." Misato almost sobbed.  
"只是担心他们会像我们一样搞砸一切。" 美里几乎哽咽道。

"We're here now, aren't we?" Kaji said as he grabbed her hand, his smile replaced by a look of serious determination as he stopped her from drinking another round of sake, he really didn't want to repeat that experience. Misato's hand went up to his face and caressed his unshaven cheek while her lips formed a small smile.  
"我们现在已经在这里了，不是吗？" 加持说着，抓住了她的手，他的笑容被严肃决心的表情所取代，他阻止她再喝一轮清酒，他真的不想重蹈覆辙。美里抬起手，抚摸着他未刮胡子的脸颊，嘴角露出一丝微笑。

"Did you say anything to them?" Kaji asked after a few moments of silence.  
"你跟他们说了什么吗？" 加持在片刻沉默后问道。

"No…I…" Misato began, looking away from Kaji in shame "…I just couldn't. It was like it was happening all over again. I just had to leave." She just shut it out and ran away rather than dealing with the situation in front of her. That's what she had done after witnessing Second Impact firsthand. Become a mute who shut out the world for _**years**_. When she realized Kaji was like her father she ran away from it as well.  
"没有……我……" 美里开始说道，羞愧地避开加持的目光 "……我就是说不出口。感觉就像一切都在重演。我只能离开。" 她选择了关闭心门，逃离现场，而不是面对眼前的局面。这就是她在亲眼目睹第二次冲击后所做的：变成了一个对外界关闭多年的哑巴。当她意识到加持像她父亲一样时，她也选择了逃离。

'Ironic considering all the times I told Shinji to stand firm and not to run away. You'd think I'd heed my own advice. What kind of guardian am I?'  
“真是讽刺，我曾多次告诉真嗣要坚持，不要逃避。你以为我会听从自己的建议。我算什么监护人？”

These questions tumbled around in Misato's mind for the rest of the evening as her sake was slowly, well not really slowly, depleted as she and Kaji did their best impression of small talk, leaving the big questions for later.  
这些问题在 Misato 的脑海中翻腾了一整晚，她和 Kaji 尽力模仿着闲聊，把大问题留到以后，而她的清酒则慢慢——好吧，其实并不慢——被消耗殆尽。

Eventually, as usually happens when alcohol and the opposite sex mix, they headed back to Kaji's apartment and well, one thing led to another.  
最终，当酒精和异性混合时，通常会发生的情况出现了，他们回到了 Kaji 的公寓，嗯，事情就这样发展了。

Afterwards, Misato stared at the ceiling as the afterglow and slowly fading buzz combined to produce unsettling thoughts in her mind.  
事后，美里盯着天花板，余晖与逐渐消退的嗡鸣交织，在她心中激起不安的思绪。

Did she call him just because she wanted to feel alive? Because she knew calling him meant sex? Just because she'd derive validation of her existence from the pleasure, he gave her? Or was their relationship something more?  
她打电话给他，仅仅是因为她想感受活着的滋味吗？因为她知道打电话意味着性？仅仅因为她能从他给予的愉悦中获得存在的确认？还是他们的关系有更深的含义？

Misato rather than dwelling on the existential angst these questions posed reached for the pack of cigarettes on the nightstand, reasoning that lung cancer would kill her slower than the dread from contemplating any of those queries.  
美里没有沉溺于这些存在主义的焦虑，而是伸手去拿床头柜上的香烟，她认为肺癌会让她比思考这些问题带来的恐惧更慢地死去。

The whirling smoke filled the bedroom with its acrid stench while Kaji also stared at the ceiling, perhaps also pondering the nature of their relationship, though his words disproved this hypothesis.  
旋转的烟雾将卧室填满，带着刺鼻的气味，而加持也盯着天花板，或许也在思考他们关系的本质，尽管他的话语否定了这一假设。

"If it's been going on that long they have to be using some kind of protection." Kaji realized in the afterglow.  
“如果已经持续了那么久，他们肯定采取了某种保护措施。”加持在余韵中意识到。

"Probably but I've never seen any."  
“可能吧，但我从未见过。”

Misato wasn't sure if it really mattered. As a high-ranking officer in NERV she had access to quite a lot of non-publicly available data. Officially the birth-rate hovered around 1.07 children per woman, not great but manageable, though in reality the so-called Baby Dearth was in full swing, and the actual birth-rate was closer to 0.15-0.25 children, not just in Japan with its historically low fertility, but everywhere. The governments of the world could massage the data all they wanted, but people are not blind.  
美里不确定这到底重不重要。作为 NERV 的高级军官，她能接触到许多非公开的数据。官方数据显示，生育率约为每名女性 1.07 个孩子，虽然不高但尚可维持，然而实际上所谓的婴儿荒正在全面展开，实际生育率接近 0.15-0.25 个孩子，不仅在日本这个历史上生育率就低的国家，全球各地都是如此。各国政府可以随意篡改数据，但人们并不盲目。

Then again, the Baby Dearth, Angels, and Eva all had to be connected somehow. And with Shinji and Asuka's proximity to all of it, it was probably better to be on the safe side.  
话说回来，婴儿荒、使徒和 EVA 之间肯定有某种联系。而真嗣和明日香与这一切如此接近，或许还是谨慎为妙。

"You haven't been teaching her any of your craft, have you?" Misato playfully asked as she poked Kaji's ribs.  
“你没教她任何你的手艺吧？”美里俏皮地问道，同时戳了戳加持的肋骨。

"No, honestly." Kaji responded with a light chuckle, tacking on the last word after a few more jabs from Misato.  
"不，说真的。" 加持轻笑一声回应，在 Misato 的连番追问后又补充了最后一句。

"Are you going to tell NERV?" Kaji asked a moment later getting to the heart of the matter. The question prompting images of a white giant crucified in the bowels of Terminal Dogma to flash before Misato's mind.  
"你打算告诉 NERV 吗？" 加持片刻后直入主题地问道。这个问题让 Misato 脑海中闪现出终端教条深处被钉在十字架上的白色巨人的画面。

"No" Misato began. "If the relationship has been going on as long as they say it has, then it's coincided with a steady rise in Synch scores and combat performance." She said as she listed the positive effects of their relationship before sighing and continuing. "The commander in me knows their relationship could pose a problem with command and control on the battlefield, yet at the same time if we separate them and try to force an end to their relationship it's likely to unhinge their mental states and ability to pilot."  
"不" Misato 开始说道。"如果他们的关系像他们说的那样已经持续了很久，那么这期间同步率稳步上升和战斗表现提高都是事实。" 她列举了他们关系带来的积极影响，然后叹了口气继续说。"作为指挥官，我知道他们的关系可能在战场上造成指挥和控制的问题，但同时，如果我们强行分开他们，试图结束这段关系，很可能会扰乱他们的心理状态和驾驶能力。"

"But if you tell NERV they'll probably demand that you do something." Kaji said putting the pieces of Misato's reasoning together.  
“但如果你告诉 NERV，他们可能会要求你采取行动。” 加持将美里的话推理串联起来。

"Exactly." Misato said as she stubbed out the cigarette in the ashtray and fell backwards, her head making a satisfying smack as it hit the pillow.  
“没错。” 美里说着，将烟蒂在烟灰缸中捻灭，然后向后一倒，头重重地砸在枕头上，发出一声令人满意的响声。

"So, what now?" Kaji asked.  
“那么，现在怎么办？” 加持问道。

"Well…" A devilish grin crossed Misato's face "If they're mature enough for _that_ they're mature enough to be left on their own for a night." Misato said as she curled up next to Kaji. "Which means…" Misato continued though left the last part unsaid.  
"嗯……" 美里脸上掠过一丝狡黠的笑容，"如果他们已经成熟到可以做那种事，那他们就足够成熟，可以独自度过一晚。" 美里说着，蜷缩在加持身边。"这意味着……" 美里继续说道，但最后一部分没有说出口。

Kaji's mind though wasn't on the purple-haired bombshell looking for round two, well it was, but not in the lewd way.  
然而，加持的心思并不在那个寻求第二轮的紫发美女身上，好吧，确实在，但并非出于下流的想法。

Being a Triple Agent is not an easy or safe road. He had only embarked upon it because truth was his obsession, or at least it was until Katsuragi rekindled something else in his heart. But he was already in too deep, made too many enemies, too few allies. He had decided to live, but death rarely stops its march based on man's decisions. Already the rival powers that he had pledged to serve were demanding irrevocable actions for him to prove his loyalty. To that end the words left his lips:  
成为一名三重间谍绝非易事，也非安全之路。他之所以踏上这条路，是因为真相是他的执念，或者至少在葛城重新点燃他心中其他东西之前是如此。但他已经陷得太深，树敌太多，盟友太少。他决定活下去，但死亡很少会因为人的决定而停止它的步伐。已经，他所效忠的敌对势力要求他采取不可撤销的行动来证明他的忠诚。为此，他的话脱口而出：

"Katsuragi, I need your help with something…"  
"葛城，我需要你帮忙处理一些事情……"

**The Neo-Ayanami Apartment: Some Weeks Later  
新绫波公寓：几周后**

"That's the last of the bags." A tired Toji Suzuhara said as he placed the glossy bags covered in English phrases he didn't understand and with handles seemingly designed to be as painful as possible, in the hallway.  
"这是最后一批袋子了。" 疲惫的铃原东治说着，将那些印着他不理解的英文短语、提手设计得似乎尽可能让人疼痛的光滑袋子放在了走廊里。

Toji had recovered fully and had even joined them for a Synch Test the previous week. He had the lowest score, barely enough theoretically to even activate a unit, though for someone with no experience, no training, and no Eva it was enough to be kept on the roster as a backup. Mostly for NERV to keep up the façade of the children the "Marduk Institute" selected were special in some way.  
冬二已经完全康复，甚至在上个星期加入了他们的同步测试。他的分数最低，理论上勉强够激活一台机体，但对于一个没有经验、没有训练、没有 EVA 的人来说，这足以让他留在名单上作为替补。主要是为了让 NERV 维持“马尔杜克机构”挑选的孩子在某种程度上是特别的这一假象。

Misato had finally been around to Rei's apartment the previous week as well and after seeing it had immediately gone to Vice-Commander Fuyutsuki. The old sensei had looked at the pictures that the Major had brought and sighed:  
美里终于在上个星期来到了绫波的公寓，看到后立刻去找了副司令冬月。老教授看了美里带来的照片，叹了口气：

"_We'll move her."_ “我们会搬走她。”

There was no shortage of housing in Tokyo-3, which stood in stark contrast to the rest of Japan where space was at a premium especially with the flooding and irradiating of the Kanto Plain that had been home to nearly a third of Japan's Pre-Impact population. It was why Katsuragi's apartment block was nearly empty. The building had been finished in the days before the 3rd Angel's attack, with Misato flashing her NERV badge the day the last construction workers left so she could get out of her cramped one-room apartment. And then Sachiel came, and all of Misato's would-be neighbors backed out leaving the building nearly empty. Tokyo-3 still had a sizeable civilian population composed of those too-stubborn to leave or who had signed binding mortgages before the Angels returned. But still the population was nowhere near where it should be, though it was enough to provide urban amenities and support NERV's functions.  
东京-3 的住房并不短缺，这与日本其他地方形成了鲜明对比，尤其是关东平原遭受洪水和辐射污染后，那里曾是日本前冲击时期近三分之一人口的家园。正因为如此，葛城家的公寓楼几乎空无一人。这座建筑在第三次使徒袭击前完工，Misato 在最后一批建筑工人离开的那天亮出了她的 NERV 徽章，以便从她那狭小的单间公寓搬出来。然后萨奇尔出现了，Misato 未来的邻居们都退缩了，使得大楼几乎空无一人。东京-3 仍然拥有相当数量的平民人口，他们太固执不愿离开，或者在使徒回归前签订了有约束力的抵押贷款。尽管如此，人口仍远未达到应有水平，但足以提供城市便利设施并支持 NERV 的运作。

As it was the Neo-Ayanami Apartment, as Asuka had named it, was about the same distance from the Katsuragi apartment as to their school in a new development, like Misato's, though it was only one bedroom.  
正如明日香所称的‘新绫波公寓’，它与葛城公寓到学校的距离差不多，位于一个新开发区，与 Misato 的公寓类似，不过只有一间卧室。

Shinji had offered to help Rei move, with Asuka immediately tagging along for obvious reasons, while Hikari, in her role as class representative had insisted on coming as well so she could see where her classmate lived and verify the new address for the school. Toji was there as well as Hikari thought the extra muscle would be needed to move Rei's belongings.  
真嗣主动提出帮助丽搬家，而明日香出于显而易见的原因立刻跟了上来，作为班长的光也坚持要来，以便看看同学的新住处并确认学校的地址记录。至于剑介，光认为搬家时多些力气总是需要的，所以他也来了。

Problem though was all that Rei owned fit into two medium-sized boxes, mainly clothes and some books. The new apartment was fully furnished so nothing else needed moving.  
问题是，丽所有的家当只装满了两个中等大小的箱子，主要是衣服和一些书。新公寓家具齐全，所以不需要搬其他东西。

"_That's it!?" Hikari had said seeing the two boxes Shinji and Toji had carried in and placed in Rei's new bedroom._  
“就这些！？”看到真嗣和剑介搬进来的两个箱子并放在丽的新卧室里时，光惊讶地说道。

"_It is all that is needed." Rei had responded in her usual fashion._  
"这就足够了。" 丽以她一贯的方式回应道。

"_Wondergirl" Asuka said as she looked around the bare white walls of the apartment "This is too boring! We need to spruce it up!"_  
"奇迹少女" 明日香环顾着公寓里光秃秃的白墙说，"这太无聊了！我们需要装饰一下！"

"_OOOh yes! There's a mall near here!" Hikari responded excitedly as she grabbed one of Rei's hands while Asuka took the other. But the blue-haired girl didn't budge._  
"哦，是的！这附近有个购物中心！" 光兴奋地说着，抓住了丽的一只手，而明日香则抓住了另一只。但蓝发的女孩没有动。

"_That is unnecessary." She said laconically "I require nothing else."_  
"那没有必要。" 她简短地说，"我不需要其他东西。"

"_Please, Rei." Shinji began "We just want to help." Shinji said a smile on his face. A moment later, Rei relented and allowed herself to be almost dragged along by the two friends while Toji and Shinji shared a grimace as it dawned on them what going to the mall with girls entailed._  
"请吧，丽。" 真嗣开始劝说，"我们只是想帮忙。" 真嗣脸上带着微笑。片刻后，丽终于让步，几乎是被两个朋友拖着走，而东治和真嗣则交换了一个苦笑，意识到陪女生去商场意味着什么。

Hence Toji's complaining about the weight of the purchases from their impromptu shopping spree.  
因此，东治抱怨起他们临时起意的购物狂欢所购买的物品的重量。

A fair bit were new clothes for Rei, well more Hikari and Asuka living vicariously through Rei's dimensions, though some of what they bought were paintings to make the apartment livelier. Rei had eschewed the posters and other paraphernalia typical of a teenager's room and had instead been drawn to these. Most were realist of romanticist landscapes though some were impressionist portraits.  
不少是给丽买的新衣服，更确切地说，是光和明日香借丽的身材间接体验新装，不过她们也买了一些画作来让公寓更有生气。丽没有选择典型的青少年房间海报和其他装饰品，而是被这些画作吸引。大多数是写实或浪漫主义的风景画，也有一些是印象派肖像画。

They'd also bought the basics for any kitchen pantry, rice, miso, sugar, salt, and so on, reluctantly Rei agreed to Shinji, with Hikari's help, preparing a meal for all of them, fried tofu and vegetables with miso soup and rice.  
他们还购置了厨房的基本食材，如大米、味噌、糖、盐等，丽不情愿地同意了真嗣在光子的帮助下为他们所有人准备一顿饭，包括炸豆腐和蔬菜、味噌汤以及米饭。

While the two designated cooks were in the kitchen, Toji was drafted yet again, this time by Asuka to help place the pictures on the wall. Though here 'help' really meant do all the work and reposition the artwork ten times while Asuka and Rei debated the finer points of lighting and reflection.  
当两位指定的厨师在厨房忙碌时，东治再次被征召，这次是由明日香指派去帮忙挂画。虽然这里的“帮忙”实际上意味着做所有的工作，并在明日香和丽争论光线和反射的细微差别时，反复调整画作的位置十次。

"It's good to see you smiling so much." Hikari said as they worked together.  
"看到你笑得这么开心真好。" 光一边工作一边说道。

"Thanks, Hikari." Shinji said with a grin on his face as he looked at her "Could you pass me the ladle?" Shinji asked.  
"谢谢，光。" 真嗣笑着看着她，"你能把勺子递给我吗？" 真嗣问道。

"Here you go." She said as she handed him the utensil.  
"给你。" 她一边说一边把餐具递给他。

Shinji took the ladle and stirred the miso for a moment before lifting up the ladle to taste the soup. As the warm liquid flowed paste his tongue, he closed his eyes and smiled. Though it wasn't the miso, excellent though it may be, that made him smile. No that was the memory that had kept replaying in his mind again and again for nearly a fortnight:  
真嗣拿起勺子，搅动了一会儿味噌汤，然后举起勺子尝了一口。随着温暖的液体流过他的舌头，他闭上眼睛微笑了。尽管这味噌汤虽然美味，但让他微笑的并非汤本身。不，那是他脑海中一遍又一遍重现的记忆，已经持续了近两周：

_It was the day after Shinji and Asuka had told Misato. She'd returned and they sat at the kitchen table. The NERV Major's face now stern and serious, evidently having overcome the shock from the previous evening.  
那是真嗣和明日香告诉美里后的第二天。她回来了，他们坐在厨房的餐桌旁。NERV 的少校现在面容严肃认真，显然已经从昨晚的震惊中恢复过来。_

"_What are you going to do Misato?" Shinji had asked a few tense moments after she had called them here._  
“你打算怎么办，美里？”在她叫他们过来几分钟后，真嗣紧张地问道。

"_That depends on how you answer these questions." Major Katsuragi said, and after letting out a sigh added "I want the truth. Nothing else. Understood?"_  
"那取决于你们如何回答这些问题。" 葛城美里少校说道，叹了口气后补充道："我要的是真相。别的什么都不要。明白了吗？"

_Both the pilots nodded in understanding before Misato continued.  
两位驾驶员点头表示理解，随后美里继续。_

"_Do you two really love each other." The NERV Major asked first, stressing each word._  
"你们俩真的相爱吗？" NERV 的葛城少校首先问道，每个字都加重了语气。

"_Yes." Both responded immediately and in-sync with the other._  
"是的。" 两人立即异口同声地回答。

"_Are you using protection?" Misato asked as she continued her line of questioning._  
"你们有采取保护措施吗？" 美里继续她的提问。

"_Yes." They again answered together._  
"是的。" 他们再次齐声回答。

"_Did you really…" Misato began though paused as she looked for the right words. "…break it then?" She said this directed only towards Asuka rather than the both of them._  
"你真的……" 美里开口道，却在寻找合适的词时顿住了。"……那时候就把它打破了？" 她这话是单独对明日香说的，而不是对他们两个。

"_No." Asuka admitted after a moment and with her eyes looking down at her knees as she remembered the deception she had laid after Sahaquiel._  
"没有。" 明日香片刻后承认道，眼睛垂下看着自己的膝盖，回想起在萨哈基尔之后所设下的骗局。

"_I had been so worried I'd taken that from you! I'm so glad you got to experience that with Shinji!" The purple-haired guardian blurted out as she stood up and rushed over to squeeze Asuka in the tightest bear-hug she'd ever felt._  
"我曾那么担心我会夺走你的那份体验！我真高兴你能和真嗣一起经历那些！" 紫发的守护者脱口而出，站起身来冲过去，给了明日香一个她感受过的最紧的熊抱。

"_Misa...to…" Asuka managed as her lungs struggled to form words under Misato's embrace._  
"Misa...疼…" 明日香勉强说道，她的肺部在美里怀抱的压力下艰难地形成话语。

"_It was Shinji right?" Misato teased with a wink as she finally let go of the German redhead and looked at her wards._  
"是真嗣对吧？" 美里眨眼调侃道，终于放开了德国红发女孩，看着她的两个孩子。

"_**YES MISATO!"**_ _The two lovers exclaimed, not wanting to discuss_ _**that**_ _experience right now._  
"是的，美里！" 这对恋人齐声喊道，此刻并不想讨论那段经历。

"_Okay Okay…" Misato said through a chuckle her earlier serious persona long forgotten._  
“好了好了…” 美里笑着说，之前的严肃模样早已抛诸脑后。

"_I'm not going to tell the higher ups, that'll just complicate things, so you've got to keep up your charade for Section 2." The Major said after a few moments once she had collected herself._  
“我不会告诉上级，那只会让事情复杂化，所以你得继续在第二课保持你的伪装。” 几分钟后，当她重新整理好自己，这位少校说道。

"_Isn't that dangerous for you Misato?" Shinji asked, the worry etched in his voice._  
“那对你来说不危险吗，美里？” 真嗣问道，声音中流露出担忧。

"_Technically, and I mean very technically, this does fall under my purview as your commanding officer and guardian, so I do have the authority to do this." Misato said trying to convince herself as much as the pilots, though given what she and Kaji had discussed, willfully withholding information like this from her superiors was fairly blasé._  
"严格来说，我是说非常严格地讲，这确实属于我作为你的指挥官和监护人的职责范围，所以我确实有权这么做。" 美里试图说服自己和两位驾驶员，尽管她和加持讨论过，故意向她的上级隐瞒这样的信息已经相当大胆了。

"_But if the Commander or Dr. Akagi knew they'd likely override you." Asuka said, correctly deducing the logic as Kaji had the night before._  
"但如果司令或赤木博士知道了，他们很可能会否决你的决定。" 明日香说，正确地推断出了逻辑，就像加持前一晚所做的那样。

"_Yep." Misato said as she went over to the fridge, frowned that only twenty gallons of beer remained, then smiled as she grabbed a cold Yebisu and popped the top._  
"没错。" 美里说着走向冰箱，皱眉发现只剩下二十加仑的啤酒，然后笑着拿出一瓶冰镇的惠比寿啤酒，打开了瓶盖。

"_Why Misato?" Shinji asked as he stood there, holding Asuka's hand, their fingers intertwined in a tight embrace. Major Katsuragi took a sip of her beer, and repeated the distilled version of the idea that had been bouncing around in her head since her wards told her they were secret lovers:_  
"为什么是美里小姐？" 真嗣站在那里问道，手里紧握着明日香的手，两人的手指紧紧相扣。葛城美里少校喝了一口啤酒，重复着自从她的孩子们告诉她他们是秘密恋人以来，一直在她脑海中盘旋的简化版想法：

"_Because we're not just cogs in the machine…. we, you, everyone deserves to be happy."_  
"因为我们不仅仅是机器中的齿轮……我们，你，每个人都值得幸福。"

Shinji Ikari opened his eyes again his grin almost ear to ear as he recalled the memory yet again.  
碇真嗣再次睁开眼睛，他的笑容几乎咧到了耳根，又一次回忆起那个记忆。

They hadn't gotten to stand before the world without fear, but it was a first step, one less worry in a sea of troubles. Misato had of course been quick to forbid any frisky business and sleep in separate beds while she was around, but they could live with that.  
他们还未曾无畏地站在世界面前，但这至少是迈出了第一步，少了一份忧虑，在烦恼的海洋中。美里当然迅速禁止了任何轻率的举动，并要求他们在她面前分床睡，但他们可以接受这一点。

Hikari meanwhile remembered that she had forgotten to leave next month's prescription in Asuka's locker, so she went to go find her redheaded friend. They went to the hallway and checking that no one, well really just Rei, was there Hikari handed Asuka the medication.  
与此同时，光子记起她忘了把下个月的处方药放在明日香的储物柜里，于是她去找她的红发朋友。她们走到走廊，确认没有人在，尤其是丽，光子把药递给了明日香。

"You sure you're not going to need these?" Asuka said with a wry grin as she placed the pills in her own purse.  
“你确定不需要这些吗？”明日香带着一丝戏谑的笑容说着，将药片放入自己的手提包中。

"Asuka! That's so improper!" Hikari whispered in the harshest tone she could manage, but Asuka could tell her heart wasn't really in it. "Is it really like what you said?" Hikari asked a moment later, her face nearly crimson.  
“明日香！这样太不合适了！” 光用她能发出的最严厉的语气低声说道，但明日香看得出她并非真心如此。“真的像你说的那样吗？” 光片刻后又问，脸颊几乎红透了。

"It's all of that and more." Asuka said as her own face colored at the memory of their past slumber party where she conveyed in maybe a _**little**_ too much detail her and Shinji's relationship. "But only when you're ready." Asuka added squeezing her friend's hand to reassure her, so she didn't rush into decisions best made with a clear mind.  
“确实如此，甚至更多。” 明日香说着，想起上次睡衣派对时，她可能过于详细地讲述了她和真嗣的关系，自己的脸也微微泛红。“但只有当你准备好了才行。” 明日香补充道，紧握朋友的手以示安慰，让她不要急于做出需要清醒头脑的决定。

While the boys' better halves were out in the hallway Toji and Rei were left alone to put up the last painting in Rei's relatively spacious bedroom.  
当男孩们的另一半在走廊上时，留在房间里的只有阿薰和绫波，他们负责挂上绫波相对宽敞的卧室里的最后一幅画。

"That should do it." The tracksuit wearing jock said as he adjusted the frame so it was level. "What do you think Rei?"  
"这样应该行了。" 穿着运动服的运动员调整了框架，使其水平。"你觉得怎么样，绫波？"

"It is acceptable, Pilot Suzuhara." Rei said in her usual blank way.  
"可以接受，驾驶员铃原。" 绫波以她一贯的平淡语气说道。

Toji chuckled at the mention of his pilot status as it brought back memories:  
听到自己被称作驾驶员，真治轻笑了一声，这让他回忆起了往事：

_He'd gone with Shinji to the locker rooms after their synch-test determined to get some answers.  
他和真嗣在同步测试后一起去了更衣室，决心要弄清楚一些事情。_

_Despite what Asuka may think of his intelligence Toji had thought this through, he'd kept his eye out for cameras, which he didn't think they'd have in the locker room, but it never hurt to check, and he turned the showers next to them to drown out any listening devices there might be.  
尽管明日香可能对他的智商有所怀疑，但东治已经深思熟虑过了。他留意了摄像头，虽然他认为更衣室里不会有，但检查一下总没坏处。他还打开了旁边的淋浴，以淹没可能存在的任何窃听设备。_

"_Hikari told me."_ _He said simply to his friend. A few days prior he'd seen the pills in Hikari's bag and had questions, and Hikari, rather than telling him the lie she had told her doctor had told him everything. She just couldn't lie to him, not after almost losing him._  
“光告诉我的。”他简单地对朋友说。几天前，他看到了光书包里的药片，心生疑问，而光没有像对医生那样撒谎，而是把一切都告诉了他。她就是无法对他撒谎，尤其是在差点失去他之后。

_Shinji just stood there in his plugsuit, nodding for a moment, before turning to look at his friend with a serious look Toji had only ever seen once before, when he and Kensuke through circumstance ended up in Unit-01's entry plug during the battle with the 4__th_ _Angel._  
真嗣就那样穿着插入栓服站在那里，点了点头，然后转头看向他的朋友，那严肃的表情是东治以前只在一次偶然中见过的，当时他和健介因缘际会地进入了零号机的插入栓，参与了与第四使徒的战斗。

"_Well, if Hikari told you then you also know_ _**why**_ _she knows." Shinji responded, his tone wasn't angry, it was hard for Toji to put a word to it. Stern perhaps? Formidable? It lacked venom or anger, but also kindness._  
“嗯，如果光子告诉了你，那你应该也知道她为什么知道。”真嗣回答道，他的语气并不愤怒，东治很难用一个词来形容。严厉？威严？它既没有恶意也没有愤怒，但也缺乏善意。

"_Yeah…" Toji said awkwardly as both his and Shinji's faces softened and looked away from each other for a moment._  
“是啊……”东治尴尬地说道，他和真嗣的脸色都缓和了下来，两人短暂地避开了对方的目光。

"_Why though Shin-man? Of all girls why her?" Toji asked at last deciding he'd come this far and wanted the answer._  
“为什么是绫波呢，真嗣？那么多女孩，为什么偏偏是她？” 冬二终于问道，他已经走到了这一步，渴望得到答案。

"_Because…" Shinji began after a moment of looking at the shower head spewing forth water. Collecting his thoughts, he continued "… With her I_ _**feel**_ _alive, that there is someone who understands, who cares."_  
“因为……” 真嗣在凝视着喷涌而出的淋浴头片刻后开始说道。他整理了一下思绪，继续道，“……和她在一起，我感到自己活着，感到有人理解我，有人在乎我。”

"_Alright, I get it." Toji said after a moment. He hadn't really listened to the words, but he'd seen the look in Shinji's eyes, the window to the soul, and seen the passion in them, understanding that the feelings were true._  
“好吧，我明白了。” 冬二过了一会儿说道。他并没有真正听进去那些话，但他看到了真嗣眼中的神情，那是心灵的窗户，看到了其中的热情，明白了这些感情是真挚的。

"_Just don't tell Kensuke, he's a good friend, but secrecy is not one of his strengths." Shinji said, returning to his more awkward normal tone of voice. Both fiends shared a laugh again at the expense of their bespeckled otaku._  
"只是别告诉真介，他是个好朋友，但保密可不是他的强项。" 真嗣说着，回到了他那略显尴尬的正常语调。两位好友再次因为那位戴眼镜的御宅族朋友而笑了起来。

"_Your secret is safe with me." Toji promised._  
"你的秘密我会守口如瓶。" 冬二承诺道。

"Pilot Suzuhara." Rei said bringing Toji out of his reminiscing.  
"冬二驾驶员。" 绫波说道，让冬二从回忆中回过神来。

"Yeah?" Toji said as he turned to face his blue-haired comrade-in-arms.  
“嗯？”冬二说着转过身，面对着他那蓝发的战友。

"W-" Rei began before being interrupted.  
“我——”丽刚开口就被打断了。

"Dinner is ready!" Shinji called out from the kitchen.  
“晚饭好了！”真嗣从厨房喊道。

"Oh boy food!" Toji said almost child-like and dashing to the doorway to the kitchen before remembering someone had been talking to him. "What did you want to say Rei?"  
"哦，天哪，食物！" 真嗣几乎是孩子气地说着，冲向厨房门口，然后才想起有人在跟他说话。"你想说什么，丽？"

"Nothing." Rei said slightly shaking her head. "Let's eat."  
"没什么。" 丽微微摇头说道。"我们吃饭吧。"

The world's four Eva pilots plus Hikari ate and made small talk that even Rei joined in once or twice until the sun began to set and everyone said their goodbyes.  
世界上的四名 EVA 驾驶员加上光一起吃饭，闲聊着，连丽也偶尔加入一两次，直到太阳开始下山，大家才互道再见。

The two couples left, Toji and Hikari walking hand in hand while Shinji and Asuka were on either side of the pair to keep up the illusion for any watching eyes.  
两对情侣离去，真治和明日香分别走在两人两侧，以维持旁观者眼中的假象，而加持和光则手牵手漫步。

Rei Ayanami, First Child and designated pilot of Unit-00, now alone, sat on her new bed, it was softer than the last. She had never really concerned herself with physical comfort or what might be called "happiness" or "pleasure" it was utterly irrelevant and pointless to her purpose. Yet, as her eyes glanced at the paintings on the wall, as her mind remembered the pleasant taste of their dinner, better than any she'd had with the Commander, a small almost whisper of a smile appeared on her lips.  
绫波零，第一适格者兼零号机的指定驾驶员，此刻独坐于她那张比以往更柔软的新床上。她从未真正在意过物质舒适或所谓的“幸福”与“快乐”，这些对她的人生目标而言毫无意义。然而，当她的目光掠过墙上的画作，脑海中回想起晚餐的美味，那比与司令共餐时任何一次都要好，一丝几乎难以察觉的微笑悄然浮现在她的唇边。

It was dashed though as other things passed before her mind's eye and her lips brought forth the question:  
但这份微笑转瞬即逝，因为其他思绪涌入脑海，她的唇间不禁吐出了疑问：

"Why her?" “为什么是她？”

**A/N:** Well, here we are. The cat's out of the bag, well mostly. For those expecting Mama-Bear Misato to act different I based this response on the duality of her character. She's a tough competent commander but is damn near clueless when it comes to relationships and people. We see this in the canon with her continual struggles with her and Kaji's relationship, her failure to really connect with and help Asuka or Shinji with their deep trauma, her simply letting Asuka run away, thinking it best they don't live together anymore, her seeking to comfort Shinji sexually after the assumed death of Rei, the list goes on. So, to me "Deer in the Headlights" seemed like a plausible response to this unexpected development, that and to my knowledge no other fic did that. Also, I wanted to lay out as concisely as possible my interpretation of what Kaji was up to during the whole series, since it is never explicitly stated, and even the Eva Wiki has to use some guesswork. This had less lemon, but the special was all just lemon, and I had a lot of threads to tie together. As you can see I'm trying to do one chapter per episode, so now we're getting into the arcs of the show where all the _**really**_ bad stuff happens, so stay tuned to it changes. As always let me know what you think.  
作者笔记：好吧，我们到了这里。猫已经从袋子里出来了，嗯，基本上是这样。对于那些期待母熊般的美里会有不同表现的人，我是基于她性格的双重性来构建这个回应的。她是一位坚强能干的指挥官，但在人际关系和人情世故方面却几乎一无所知。在原作中，我们可以看到她与加持关系的持续挣扎，她未能真正与帮助明日香或真嗣处理他们深层的创伤，她简单地让明日香离开，认为他们不再住在一起是最好的，她在丽被假定死亡后试图通过性来安慰真嗣，这样的例子不胜枚举。因此，对我来说，“惊慌失措”似乎是对这个意外发展的合理反应，而且据我所知，没有其他同人作品这样做过。此外，我想尽可能简洁地阐述我对整个系列中加持所做之事的解读，因为这从未被明确说明，甚至连 EVA 维基都不得不使用一些猜测。这篇文中的柠檬元素较少，但特别篇全是柠檬，而我有很多线索需要串联起来。 如你所见，我正尝试每集写一章，现在我们即将进入剧集中那些糟糕透顶的情节部分，敬请期待它的变化。一如既往，欢迎告诉我你的想法。

### Chapter 11 Schmerzendes Herz und Gehirn

**Katsuragi Apartment: Just before dawn  
葛城公寓：黎明前夕**

Misato Katsuragi, NERV Major and Operations Director, sat at the kitchen table in the apartment she shared with two lovers and a penguin, who shouldn't be able to, but probably could drink her under said table.  
葛城美里，NERV 少校兼作战部长，坐在她与两位恋人及一只本不该能、但很可能能喝倒她的企鹅同住的公寓厨房桌前。

Her morning beer was absent, however.  
然而，她的晨间啤酒却不见踪影。

She had slept badly. The steam from the paint thinner brew she had made wafted up to her nostrils as she tried to solve that problem with caffeine. Though it would have helped Misato to actually drink some of the coffee rather than rest her head against her crossed hands in a vain attempt to control the anxiety she felt.  
她昨晚睡得不好。当她试图用咖啡因解决这个问题时，她制作的稀释剂冲泡出的蒸汽飘入她的鼻孔。尽管美里如果能真正喝点咖啡而不是将头靠在交叉的手上，徒劳地试图控制内心的焦虑，那会更有帮助。

"Today's the day." She said quietly to herself as the first rays of the morning sun streaked through the sliding glass door that led to the veranda and illuminated the apartment.  
"就是今天了。" 她轻声自语，晨曦的第一缕阳光透过通往阳台的滑动玻璃门，照亮了整个公寓。

Her brooding was interrupted by the sound of a bedroom door opening followed by shuffling feet until Shinji's better half, the Great Asuka Langley Sohryu entered the kitchen.  
她的沉思被卧室门打开的声音打断，随后是拖沓的脚步声，直到真嗣的另一半，伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷走进厨房。

"Mornin' Misato." The redhead said through a yawn as her feet carried her on instinct towards the bathroom.  
"早安，美里。" 红发少女打着哈欠说道，她的脚步本能地向浴室走去。

Misato paused her ruminations and looked up to greet her German ward. "Goo-." Until her brain registered how Asuka was dressed.  
美里停下了她的沉思，抬头迎接她的德国养女。“咕——”直到她的脑子意识到明日香穿的是什么。

"Hey!" Misato raised her voice to its commander level before continuing. "Didn't I say no sleeping together!" Misato said as she stood up, her hands braced against the table like a predator about to pounce.  
“嘿！”美里提高了声音，恢复到指挥官的语气，继续说道，“我不是说过不能一起睡吗！”美里站起身来，双手撑在桌子上，像一只准备扑食的猛兽。

"Whaa-…" The still sleepy Asuka said rather puzzled as she rubbed her sleepy eyes. "Oh this!" Asuka said as she shook her hand along with the sleeve of what all the fuss was about. One of Shinji's school shirts. Which aside from her red panties, was the only thing she was wearing. "No, we didn't Misato, I just took one of his shirts and slept in it." Asuka answered her tone rather sheepish. She was grateful for the fact that she had done up some of the buttons on the shirt. Not that it made much of a difference since everyone in this apartment has seen what's underneath.  
“哇——…”明日香还带着睡意，有些困惑地揉着惺忪的眼睛。“哦，这个！”明日香说着，挥动着手臂和袖子，展示着引起这场风波的东西——真嗣的一件校服衬衫。除了她的红色内裤，这是她唯一穿的东西。“不，我们没有，美里，我只是拿了他的衬衫穿着睡了。”明日香回答时语气有些尴尬。她庆幸自己扣上了衬衫的一些扣子。不过，这也没多大差别，毕竟这公寓里的每个人都见过她下面是什么。

"Oh, okay." The usually lively purple-head said in a rather morose tone as she sat back in her chair that a more awake Asuka would have picked up on.  
“哦，好吧。”平时活泼的紫发女孩带着相当忧郁的语气说道，她坐回椅子上，如果是更清醒的明日香，肯定会注意到这一点。

Asuka then continued on her quest to the bathroom and after handling nature's call returned to the kitchen table to sit with Misato. But not before grabbing a cup of the coffee her guardian had made.  
随后，明日香继续她的卫生间之旅，处理完自然的召唤后，她回到厨房桌旁与美里坐在一起。但在那之前，她抓起了一杯她的监护人泡的咖啡。

She lifted the mug up and after putting it to her mouth her drowsy eyes shot open as her lips curled in disgust.  
她举起杯子，放到嘴边后，她昏昏欲睡的眼睛突然睁大，嘴唇因厌恶而扭曲。

"_**Verdammt**_Misato!" Asuka exclaimed after forcing herself to swallow the bitter drink.  
“该死的 Misato！”Asuka 在强迫自己咽下那苦涩的饮料后喊道。

"It works, doesn't it? Makes you forget how tired you are." Misato said through a laugh as she finally took a drink of her own coffee. Her mood becoming cheerier, and her worries momentarily pushed to the back of her mind.  
“它有效，不是吗？让你忘记自己有多累。”Misato 笑着说，终于喝了一口自己的咖啡。她的心情变得愉快，忧虑暂时被抛到了脑后。

'Suppose I should be glad there's no curry spices or absinthe in the blend." Asuka thought as she mused on Misato's "_creative"_ culinary sense.  
“我想我应该庆幸这混合物里没有咖喱香料或苦艾酒。”Asuka 想着，对 Misato“创意”的烹饪品味感到无奈。

The two women sat there, sharing a moment of silence as the tense Major drank her coffee black while the redhead added in as much cream and sugar as she could find to make Misato's brew potable.  
两位女士坐在那里，共享着沉默的时刻，紧张的少校喝着黑咖啡，而红发女子则尽可能多地加入奶油和糖，以使美里煮的咖啡变得可饮。

"So…" Misato began, her eyes fixated on her coffee as she spoke "Is it everything you've ever dreamed?" She asked her dark eyes coming up to look at Asuka's cerulean orbs. Misato didn't often get a chance to talk to the two children by themselves, it was usually the pair of them, or they were in a place where such frank conversations were impossible. And given what could transpire today, Misato wanted to give voice to some of the thoughts that had rattled in her mind since Asuka and Shinji's revelation. Though whether she was asking for her own sake or to be sure before today was another question.  
明日香移开视线，凝望着远方，汤匙搅拌咖啡的叮当声在厨房中回响，片刻后她才开口回应：

Asuka looked away staring off into the distance while the clinking sound of her spoon stirring her coffee filled the kitchen before she uttered her response after several moments:

"No."

"Wha-?!" Misato began, the shock evident in her voice before Asuka spoke up:  
"什——？！" 美里刚开口，声音中的震惊显而易见，随后明日香插话道：

"Calm down Misato." Asuka said waving her hand in a way she hoped was calming before she continued, "You dream about what love is." She paused to look into her nearly snow-white coffee before saying more "When you're young you have this perfect naïve vision of love." "Candles, romantic dinners, grand gestures and all that?" Misato said as she surmised what the German redhead meant.  
"冷静点，美里。" 明日香挥手示意，希望自己的动作能带来安抚，然后继续说，"你梦见爱情是什么样子。" 她停顿了一下，凝视着几乎雪白的咖啡，接着说，"年轻时，你对爱情有着完美而天真的幻想。" "烛光晚餐，浪漫约会，大张旗鼓的举动，诸如此类？" 美里推测着德国红发少女的意思。

"Yeah." Asuka began before taking a sip of the cream with some coffee in it before continuing "And that's what you dream about finding. But it's false, real love…"  
"对。" 明日香开始说，然后啜了一口掺着咖啡的奶油，继续道，"那就是你梦想找到的。但那是假的，真正的爱……"

"…is feeling comfortable with someone, having that feeling of trust." Misato finished for Asuka as her fingers unconsciously curled round the cross around her neck.  
"…与某人相处感到自在，拥有那种信任感。" 美里替明日香说完，手指无意识地卷绕着脖子上的十字架。

"Exactly. But you don't really know what love is. Not until you have it. Then you understand." Asuka said, her tone a mix of dreamy and serious peculiar to those who know a primal truth. "Don't get me wrong there is a lot of burning, blinding, passion and romance but that's not the fundamental part." Misato's young ward began in a more whimsical tone before reverting to her serious voice for the last sentence "The essence of love, is trust, and you know both of us have real trust issues."  
"没错。但你并不真正了解什么是爱。直到你拥有它。那时你才会明白。" 明日香说道，她的语气混合着梦幻与严肃，这是那些知晓原始真理的人特有的。"别误会，有很多炽热、炫目、充满激情的浪漫，但那不是根本的部分。" 美里的年轻监护人以一种更梦幻的语调开始，然后在最后一句话中恢复了严肃的语气，"爱的本质是信任，而你知道我们俩都有真正的信任问题。"

"The commanding officer in me is just worried about you using each other as an emotional crutch to get through your past…trauma." Misato said getting to the heart of the matter, that unresolved doubt she still had, that worry that the gulf between men and women, between other people really, was still too deep for the other to truly understand each other.  
"作为指挥官的我只是担心你们会互相利用对方作为情感支柱来度过过去的…创伤。" 美里说到了问题的核心，那个她仍未解决的疑虑，那个担忧，男女之间，或者说人与人之间，那道鸿沟仍然太深，以至于对方无法真正理解彼此。

"What is the difference between a rock and crutch though?" Asuka said as she responded to Misato's question with one her own. "How do you know?"  
"石头和拐杖有什么区别呢？" 明日香回应美里的问题，反问道，"你怎么知道？"

"Hah, you put too much weight on it I guess." Misato answered, the heaviness of her sidearm under her jacket feeling unbearable at that moment as Kaji's words sounded in her head for the millionth time.  
"哈，你大概是太依赖它了吧。" 美里回答，她夹克下藏着的配枪此刻感觉沉重得难以承受，仿佛加贺的那些话在脑海中回响了无数次。

The women's conversation was interrupted by the sound of another bedroom door opening, proving Asuka was telling the truth, followed by a brown-haired boy with cobalt eyes entering the kitchen.  
女人们的对话被另一间卧室门打开的声音打断，证实了明日香所言非虚，随后一个蓝眼睛的棕发男孩走进了厨房。

"Morning Misato." Shinji Ikari said as he entered his culinary domain before heading directly to the source of joy in his life: "Asuka." He said as he leaned down and the two shared a morning peck on the lips.  
“早安，美里。” 真嗣一走进他的烹饪领域，便直奔生活中的喜悦之源：“明日香。” 他俯身下来，两人在唇上轻轻一吻，开始了新的一天。

"Good morning baka." Asuka responded as she cupped his cheek in her hand and rubbed a lithe hand up and down the back of his pink shirt while Shinji's own hand twirled her luscious red locks as they were strewn every which way after a good night's sleep.  
“笨蛋，早上好。” 明日香回应着，用手掌轻抚他的脸颊，纤细的手指在他粉红色的衬衫背后来回摩挲，而真嗣的手则缠绕着她那蓬松的红发，这些发丝在经过一夜安睡后散乱无章。

"Jeez get a room you two." Misato teased as she looked away from the scene before her, which in the weeks since the lovers' confession to her had become commonplace in the Katsuragi apartment. As far as the NERV Major could tell the two pilots had been keeping to their side of the bargain and sleeping in separate beds and not disappearing to one of their bedrooms while Misato was home. While she wasn't around however…eh, out of sight out of mind.  
“哎呀，你们俩找个房间吧。” 美里打趣道，目光从眼前的场景移开，自从这对恋人向她坦白以来，这样的情景在葛城公寓里已是家常便饭。就 NERV 的这位少校所知，两位驾驶员一直遵守着他们的约定，各自睡在自己的床上，没有在美里在家时溜进任何一个卧室。不过，当她不在的时候……眼不见，心不烦。

The two lovers paid no mind to their guardian's banter, contented smiles filling their faces as they saw each other at the start of a new day.  
这对恋人并未在意监护人的调侃，在新的一天开始时看到彼此，脸上洋溢着满足的微笑。

Afterwards, Shinji went over to the cupboard and took out a coffee cup. He thought he heard Asuka giggling slightly as he went but wasn't sure why.  
之后，真嗣走到橱柜前拿了一个咖啡杯。他觉得听到明日香轻轻笑了一声，但不确定原因。

'Caffeine might help.' The baka thought as he looked into the rippling black mixture before taking a swig.  
'咖啡因或许有帮助。' 这个笨蛋想着，看着眼前波动的黑色液体，然后喝了一口。

"Misato made coffee." Shinji mewled quietly as he tried his best to ignore the aftertaste overwhelming his mouth, only hoping his tastebuds deaths were swift.  
“美里做了咖啡。” 真嗣小声地呜咽着，尽力忽视那充斥口腔的余味，只希望自己的味蕾能迅速安息。

"Yep." Asuka said simply in response, and she swore Shinji's face seemed to turn green.  
“嗯哼。” 明日香简单地回应道，她发誓真嗣的脸色似乎都变绿了。

"Hey what's that's supposed to mean?!" Misato shouted defensively as her pride detected an assault on her gastronomic skills.  
“嘿，那是什么意思？！” 美里防御性地喊道，她的自尊感受到了对她烹饪技能的攻击。

"Nothing!" Both responded synchronously as they looked at her scowling face.  
“没什么！”两人异口同声地回答，目光迎上她皱眉的脸。

"Oh, okay!" Misato said in her most chipper and sweet voice as a grin spread across her face.  
“哦，好吧！”美里用她最欢快甜美的声音说道，脸上绽放出笑容。

'It's terrifying how quickly she can change emotions. If this NERV thing doesn't work out she definitely should be an actress.' Asuka thought as Shinji, after recovering and stealthily trading in the coffee for orange juice, began preparing everyone's breakfast. Eggs and toast for ladies and sardines for the penguin.  
“她情绪转变之快真是吓人。如果 NERV 这事儿不成，她绝对应该去当演员。”明日香心想，而真嗣在恢复镇定并悄悄把咖啡换成橙汁后，开始为大家准备早餐。女士们有鸡蛋和吐司，企鹅则是沙丁鱼。

In several productive minutes the food was made, and appetites sated for the time being.  
在短短几分钟内，食物就做好了，大家的胃口暂时得到了满足。

"Thanks Shinji." Misato said as she patted her belly before continuing "I've got to get in to work early so I'll be leaving now." Misato said as she got up to leave as Asuka helped Shinji clear the table.  
“谢谢你，真嗣。”美里一边拍着肚子一边说，“我得早点去上班，所以现在就得走了。”她起身离开，而明日香则帮着真嗣收拾桌子。

"Bye Misato!" The two pilots called out.  
“再见，美里！”两位驾驶员齐声喊道。

"Remember to clean up if you get frisky!" Misato teased from the doorway.  
"记得要是兴奋起来，别忘了打扫干净！" 美里在门口打趣道。

"**Misato!"** both screamed in embarrassed horror from the kitchen.  
"美里！" 两人在厨房里尴尬地尖叫起来。

'If everything goes to plan then there's nothing to worry about.' Misato thought as the door hissed shut behind her and the earlier smile melted away as she walked to the elevator.  
'如果一切按计划进行，那就没什么好担心的。' 美里想着，身后的门嘶嘶作响地关上了，她走向电梯时，之前的笑容逐渐消失。

'Arrghh! That teasing purple-headed drunk!' Asuka's mind screamed as she put the last of the dishes in the sink for Shinji to wash before turning around and harrumphing as her mind wandered down the logical rabbit hole of her lust that Misato's words had uncovered.  
“啊啊啊！那个爱捉弄人的紫头醉鬼！”明日香心里尖叫着，将最后几个盘子放进水槽让真嗣清洗，然后转过身来哼了一声，她的思绪随着美里的话揭开的欲望逻辑深渊而游走。

They were alone in the apartment for a not insignificant amount of time before they needed to be anywhere, and her last release had been days ago. She knew what she was going to do, the inevitability of it all filled her mind as her hormonal urges ate away at her self-control as she walked up behind Shinji, seemingly on autopilot.  
他们在公寓里独处的时间相当可观，而且离需要去任何地方还有一段时间，她上一次释放已经过去好几天了。她知道自己要做什么，这一切的不可避免性填满了她的脑海，她的荷尔蒙冲动侵蚀着她的自制力，她仿佛自动驾驶般走到真嗣身后。

"_**Liebling**_"Asuka said seductively as she crept up behind her brown-haired lover, undoing all the buttons on the shirt as she went, as he placed the last dish in the drying rack, her hands poised above his shoulders.  
“亲爱的”，明日香诱惑地说道，悄悄地走到她棕色头发的爱人身后，一边解开他衬衫上的所有扣子，一边看着他将最后一个盘子放进晾干架，她的双手悬在他的肩膀上方。

"Yeah Asuka…Whaa-!" Shinji said as Asuka's hands twisted him around, so they were facing each other as Asuka smothered Shinji's unprepared lips with a kiss, his response muffled by her hot lips and tongue subduing his mouth.  
“是的，明日香……哇——！” 真嗣说道，明日香的手将他扭转过来，使他们面对面，她用一个突如其来的吻堵住了真嗣未备的唇，他的回应被她火热的唇舌压制在口中。

"Misato's left us all alone." The German redhead began after the kiss ended, her arms wrapping around his neck and head, her fingers running through his short hair as her bare thigh went between his legs to try and force Shinji's body to pump blood where she wanted it.  
“美里把我们单独留下来了。”吻毕，这位德国红发少女开始说道，她的手臂环绕着他的脖颈和头部，手指穿梭在他短短的发间，她赤裸的大腿插入他的双腿之间，试图迫使真嗣的身体将血液泵向她想要的地方。

"But…" Shinji said trying to formulate a logical argument as to why he shouldn't copulate with the hot, horny, barely dressed redhead.  
“但是……” 真嗣试图构建一个逻辑上的论点，解释为什么他不应该与这位火辣、饥渴、几乎衣不蔽体的红发少女发生关系。

"You don't want me?" She said in her sweet, hurt voice as her hand adjusted the shirt she was wearing, revealing the nipple of her left breast to Shinji as she said the words.  
"你不要我了吗？" 她用甜美而受伤的声音说道，同时调整着身上的衬衫，说话间露出了左乳头给真嗣看。

"That's not wha-" Shinji began, desperately trying not to stare at her breasts as he haltingly spoke the words as Asuka draped her body onto his. Her thigh between his legs being replaced by a warm hand on his crotch, separated only by the thin fabric of his shorts as her lips planted kisses on his cheek.  
"不是那样的——" 真嗣开始说道，拼命不让自己盯着她的胸部，结结巴巴地说着话，因为明日香将身体靠在了他身上。她的大腿夹在他两腿之间，被一只温暖的手放在他的胯部取代，仅隔着薄薄的短裤布料，她的嘴唇在他脸颊上亲吻着。

"Or did you play with it before you got up and not leave any for me?" Asuka purred into his ear, saying the last part like a disappointed child as her sharp canine teeth bit into the soft cartilage. "Selfish baka."  
"还是说你起床前自己玩过了，一点都没留给我？" 明日香在他耳边低语，最后那句像是个失望的孩子，尖尖的犬齿轻咬着柔软的软骨。"自私的笨蛋。"

Now those words affected Shinji. Maybe it was all the blood his brain was lacking, or some other psychological or physiological trigger, but nevertheless it provoked a reaction like Asuka wanted it to. Shinji's face became set and stern as his hands moved to her waist and picked her up, carrying her the several steps toward the now cleared kitchen table where he set her ass roughly down on the edge. He then pulled down his shorts to reveal the rock-hard erection that Asuka's antics had given him.  
这些话触动了真嗣。或许是大脑缺血，或是其他心理或生理上的触发，但无论如何，它引发了如明日香所期望的反应。真嗣的脸变得严肃，双手移到她的腰间，将她抱起，几步走到已经清理干净的厨房桌前，粗鲁地将她的臀部放在桌边。随后，他拉下短裤，露出明日香挑逗下坚硬如石的勃起。

'Did you overdo it Sohryu?' Her mind asked as Shinji, too impatient to take off her panties, merely moved the ruby-red fabric to the side. Revealing her already moistened lower lips as Shinji hurriedly positioned his member at her entrance, barely remembering to wet his cockhead in his haste before plunging it in one swift motion into her waiting hole and filling Asuka with that comforting sense of fullness as her creases and folds moved and made way for Shinji's member. 'Nope.' Her brain decided shortly thereafter.  
'你是不是做得太过火了，惣流？' 她的内心问道，而真嗣急不可耐，没脱下她的内裤，只是将那鲜红色的布料移到一旁。露出她早已湿润的下唇，真嗣匆忙地将他的阳具对准她的入口，几乎忘了在急切中湿润龟头，便猛地一插，迅速进入她等待的洞穴，让明日香感受到那种令人安心的充实感，她的褶皱和皱褶为真嗣的阳具让路。'没有。' 她的头脑很快做出了决定。

Asuka placed her hands on the table behind her so she was leaning up and their faces were close enough so she could snatch kisses when her lusts desired Shinji's lips.  
明日香将双手放在身后的桌子上，身体微微后仰，他们的脸靠得足够近，她可以在欲望驱使下随时夺取真嗣的吻。

Though Shinji took advantage of this first. Thrusting his face forward in time with his member to cover Asuka's mouth with his before his tongue split the barrier of her lips with the same force that Shinji's cock split her lower lips. Usually, they both liked to start slow with their lovemaking, only gradually increasing the tempo as they neared their respective crescendos. But not this time. This was a true quickie where the goal was merely to scratch that itch as quickly and intensely as possible. This time Shinji's thrusts were forceful from the outset, his member on most thrusts exiting almost to the base of the cockhead before reentering Asuka's twitching folds with full force.  
尽管是真嗣先占了上风。他及时将脸凑上前，与他的分身同步，用唇覆盖住明日香的嘴，舌头以同样的力道突破她唇间的屏障，正如他的阴茎猛力分开她下体的唇瓣。通常，他们在做爱时都喜欢慢慢开始，只在接近高潮时逐渐加快节奏。但这次不同。这是一场真正的速战速决，目标仅仅是尽可能快速而强烈地缓解那股欲望。这一次，真嗣的冲刺从一开始就充满力量，他的阴茎在大多数冲刺中几乎完全退出至龟头根部，然后以全力重新进入明日香抽搐的褶皱中。

The vibrations of his thrusts caused the wood of the table to screech and groan and Asuka's borrowed shirt to flow to her sides revealing her bust in all its glory, as the mounds of flesh bounced in time with Shinji's rhythm.  
他冲刺的震动使得桌子发出刺耳的呻吟声，明日香借来的衬衫也随之滑向两侧，露出她那傲人的胸部，随着真嗣的节奏，那对丰满的乳房也跟着跳动。

Shinji moved his right hand from Asuka's waist and up to her breasts, his palm kneading her orbs while his fingers pinched and played with her brownish nipples sending tingles of excitement through Asuka's body to match with lightning jolting up from her crotch at each stroke from Shinji's member against her sensitive folds.  
真嗣将右手从明日香的腰间移开，向上抚摸她的乳房，手掌揉捏着她的圆润，手指则轻捏并逗弄着她那浅褐色的乳头，激起一阵阵兴奋的颤栗，与每次真嗣的阳具在她敏感的阴唇上摩擦时从她下体传来的电击般的快感相呼应。

Asuka felt herself getting closer to her release, her pussy becoming drenched and scorching under Shinji's assault. So, she flung her upper body forward wrapping her arms around his back and putting her head next to his, her moans sounding loudly in his ear as her self-control became non-existent in the face of the pleasure she was receiving.  
明日香感到自己即将达到高潮，她的阴部在真嗣的攻击下变得湿漉漉且火热。于是，她猛地向前倾身，双臂环抱住他的背部，将头靠在他的旁边，她的呻吟声在他耳边大声响起，面对所受的快感，她的自制力已荡然无存。

Moments later Shinji felt the tell-tale tightening of Asuka's pussy around his cock as her body shook in his embrace, and her fingernails dug into him so hard that had Shinji not been wearing a shirt his back would have been bloody.  
片刻后，真嗣感受到了明日香阴道环绕他阴茎的预示性紧缩，她的身体在他怀中颤抖，指甲深深陷入他的肉里，若非真嗣穿着衬衫，他的背部恐怕早已血迹斑斑。

As Asuka passed her climax her sensitive folds felt a throbbing followed by a spreading warmness that told her Shinji had also found his release.  
随着高潮的退去，明日香敏感的褶皱感受到了一阵跳动，紧接着是一股扩散的温暖，这告诉她真嗣也达到了释放。

He pulled himself up so his back was straight, and their eyes bored into the other's heart and soul before their lips met again to convey all the passion and emotions that words could never fully express. While this happened, Shinji slowly moved his member inside of her, helping her calm down from her high before fully removing himself from her. Asuka broke the kiss and looked down to the space between them at Shinji's coated member and her own throbbing sex as she felt what Shinji had deposited there slowly flowing down her insides toward her entrance.  
他挺直了背，两人的目光深深穿透彼此的心灵与灵魂，随后他们的唇再次相触，传递着言语永远无法完全表达的激情与情感。与此同时，真嗣缓缓地在她的体内移动，帮助她从高潮中平静下来，然后完全抽离。明日香结束了亲吻，低头看向他们之间的空隙，真嗣涂满液体的部位和她自己悸动的私处，感觉到真嗣留在那里的东西正缓缓流向她的入口。

The wood under her ass was darkened and damp. Asuka was absently aware of the surprise she felt that so much wetness had escaped her in what her logical brain knew must have been only a few minutes of passion. But that was overwhelmed by another thought screaming through her thinking brain now that her hormones had been sated.  
她臀部下的木头变得又黑又湿。明日香不经意间意识到，她对如此多的湿润在逻辑上认为仅几分钟的激情中逃逸出来感到惊讶。但这种感觉被另一个想法所淹没，那就是她的荷尔蒙已经得到满足，现在她的思考大脑中正尖叫着另一个念头。

"Fuck." "操。"

"What?" "什么？"

"We have a sync-test tomorrow." Asuka said, giving voice to the realization that came too late. The thick, creamy cum was now flowing down from her opening and staining her red panties a darker shade as the fabric absorbed the viscous liquid.  
"我们明天有个同步测试。" 明日香说道，意识到这个事实来得太迟。浓稠的精液正从她的私处流出，染红了她的红色内裤，使其颜色变得更深，因为布料吸收了那黏稠的液体。

"Oh." Shinji said in understanding.  
"哦。" 真嗣理解地说道。

"_**Schiesse!**_" Asuka said as she stood up from the kitchen table and went to the bathroom to clean herself up before school and prayed Dr. Akagi's entry plug instruments wouldn't be looking for any gooey surprises. Though not before giving her baka one last kiss.  
“该死！”明日香说着从餐桌旁站起身，前往浴室清理自己，准备上学，同时祈祷赤城博士的插入栓仪器不会发现任何黏糊糊的惊喜。尽管在给她的笨蛋最后一个吻之前。

**Later: Misato's Office 稍后：美里办公室**

The room was dark, lit only by her computer's display and the other numerous lights, some blinking, some not, that denoted the myriad of electronic devices which dotted the NERV Operations Director's workspace.  
房间昏暗，仅由她的电脑显示屏和其他众多灯光照亮，这些灯光有的闪烁，有的静止，标志着遍布 NERV 作战指挥官工作区的各种电子设备。

'Right on cue.' Misato thought as the door opened and she looked up from the budget reports she'd been pretending to work on to listen to what the two nondescript men in sunglasses and dark suits who'd come into her office had to say.  
“正合时宜。”美里心想，随着门打开，她从假装正在处理的预算报告中抬起头，准备聆听那两位戴着墨镜、身穿深色西装的普通男子进入她办公室后要说的话。

"Commander Fuyutsuki was abducted?" Misato said, trying her best to sound surprised at the news.  
“副司令冬月被绑架了？”美里说道，尽力让自己听起来对这消息感到惊讶。

"That's right, it happened two hours ago. The Vice-Commander was last seen in the eighth district." One of the agents said.  
“没错，事情发生在两小时前。副司令最后一次被人看见是在第八区。”其中一名特工说道。

"That's inside this installation! What the hell were you idiots in intelligence doing?!" Misato spat angrily, her hostility to Section 2 coming more naturally to her than her earlier faux surprise.  
“那东西就在这个设施里！你们这些情报部的白痴到底在干什么？！”美里愤怒地咆哮，对第二分部的敌意比之前假装惊讶时自然得多。

"Someone inside this organization must have been involved." The first agent said.  
“组织内部肯定有人牵涉其中。”第一名特工说道。

"We appreciate your cooperation in this." His colleague added trying to go for the classic good government agent, bad government agent trope.  
“我们感谢您在此事上的合作。”他的同事补充道，试图演绎经典的政府好特工与坏特工的套路。

"Someone who could outwit Section 2. Oh no… You don't think…!" Misato said startingly trying to give the impression that she was only gradually coming to the realization of what they were insinuating.  
"一个能智胜第二支部的人。哦不……你不会是……！" 美里突然说道，试图给人一种她只是在逐渐意识到他们所暗示的内容的印象。

"Ryoji Kaji." The second agent confirmed.  
"碇源堂。" 第二位特工确认道。

"He is the suspected mastermind behind this plot." His partner added.  
"他就是这起阴谋的幕后主使。" 他的搭档补充道。

"So that's why you came for me." Misato said, adding on a tone of resigned comprehension she hoped didn't sound forced.  
"所以这就是你来找我的原因。" 美里说道，语气中带着一种她希望听起来不那么勉强的无奈理解。

"We believe that you can help us." The quote-unquote good agent said amelioratingly before continuing: "As your colleagues we regret the necessity of including the Director of Operations as a suspect. But that is the nature of our profession."  
"我们相信你能帮助我们。" 这位所谓的优秀特工缓和地说道，接着继续："作为你的同事，我们为不得不将运营总监列为嫌疑人感到遗憾。但这就是我们职业的本质。"

"And of course, given my relationship with him it is a natural precaution." Misato said as she pulled out her sidearm and blood red NERV ID card to hand to the agents.  
"当然，考虑到我与他之间的关系，这是一种自然的预防措施。" 美里说着，掏出她的配枪和血红色的 NERV 身份证，递给特工们。

"Yes, your cooperation would be appreciated." The nearer agent said as he took the proffered items before they led the purple-head away and into a dark holding cell until the matter was resolved.  
“是的，您的合作将不胜感激。”靠近的特工接过递来的物品，随后他们带着紫发人离开，进入一间昏暗的拘留室，直至此事解决。

**The Same Time: Undisclosed Location  
同一时间：不明地点**

He awoke in a room as black as a starless night. He was faintly aware of the chair he was sitting in and the fact that his hands were bound to it by rough handcuffs, digging painfully into his wrists. Despite the lack of any information about his surroundings the old sensei knew precisely where he was and why he was here.  
他在一个漆黑如无星之夜的房间中醒来。隐约感觉到自己坐在椅子上，双手被粗糙的手铐紧紧束缚，手腕处传来阵阵痛楚。尽管对周围环境一无所知，这位老导师却清楚地知道自己身在何处以及为何在此。

'Surprised it's taken them this long." Kozo Fuyutsuki, Vice-Commander of NERV, thought just as the light under his chair came on, followed swiftly by another as a familiar voice sounded in the spacious room:  
“没想到他们拖了这么久。” NERV 的副司令官 Kozo Fuyutsuki 正这么想着，他座位下的灯光突然亮起，紧接着另一束光也迅速亮起，一个熟悉的声音在宽敞的房间中响起：

"It's been a while." “好久不见。”

"Are your invitations always so violent?" Fuyutsuki asked the voice before giving it a name "Chairman Keel." As a large black monolith inscribed with red lettering stating only audio was transmitting and designating that it was SEELE-01 appeared before him.  
“你的邀请总是这么粗暴吗？” Fuyutsuki 对着声音问道，随后给它冠以名字，“基尔议长。” 一个巨大的黑色单体出现在他面前，上面用红色字体刻着仅传输音频的标识，并指明这是 SEELE-01。

"There are a number of matters we need to discuss outside of Commander Ikari's hearing. The nature of your procurement was necessary" The chairman said by way of explanation.  
"我们有几件事需要在碇司令听不到的地方讨论。你的采购性质是必要的。" 主席以此作为解释。

"You haven't changed at all, and how this affects me is inconsequential." Fuyutsuki accused the monolith before him.  
"你一点都没变，而这对我影响甚微。" 冬月指责眼前的巨石。

"The subjects have long been an active issue, this was inevitable." Another monolith stated as it materialized in the room with them.  
"这些对象早已是一个活跃的问题，这是不可避免的。" 另一块巨石在他们所在的房间中显现并说道。

"Please understand our situation." Yet another monolith pleaded with the Vice-Commander as it appeared.  
“请理解我们的处境。”又一个巨石碑向副司令恳求道，随之显现。

"Oh, now this is surprising, not the committee but SEELE." Fuyutsuki said in mock surprise as far more monoliths than the five members of the Human Instrumentality Committee appeared around him, and also as if the giant red letters saying "SEELE" wasn't enough of a hint that the shadowy organization was abandoning their subterfuge for this interrogation.  
“哦，这可真意外，不是委员会，而是 SEELE。”冬月说道，语气中带着几分嘲弄，更多的巨石碑出现在他周围，远不止人类补完委员会的五名成员，仿佛那些巨大的红色字母“SEELE”还不足以暗示这个隐秘组织在此审讯中放弃了伪装。

"Do not toy with us!" The fourth monolith raged at the contempt it heard in the Vice-Commander's answer. His anger breaking the dam of SEELE's self-control, unleashing the torrent of their discontent.  
“别戏弄我们！”第四块巨石碑对副司令回答中听出的轻蔑感到愤怒。他的怒火冲破了 SEELE 自我控制的堤坝，释放出他们不满的洪流。

"We never intended to make new Gods!" The sixth monolith proclaimed to the assembled cabal a moment later.  
"我们从未打算创造新的神明！" 第六座巨石碑片刻后向聚集的秘密团体宣告。

"Evangelion those things which we have created have incorporated S2 organs into themselves, achieving their ultimate form." The eighth monolith added.  
"那些我们创造的东西，已经将 S2 机关融入自身，达到了它们的终极形态。" 第八座巨石碑补充道。

"Living Gods that we created." The fifth monolith lamented; the accent of the speaker heavy as he cried out: "Such blasphemy!"  
"我们创造的活生生的神。" 第五座巨石碑哀叹道；说话者的口音沉重，他呼喊着："如此亵渎！"

"Creating supreme beings and then being forced to rely on them is unacceptable." The ninth monolith stated in more reasonable tones than its compatriots.  
“创造至高无上的存在，然后被迫依赖他们，这是不可接受的。”第九块巨石以比其同伴更为理性的语气陈述道。

"Man must not create God, let alone two!" the fourth monolith bemoaned.  
“人类绝不能创造上帝，更别提两个了！”第四块巨石哀叹道。

"Can we trust anyone with that power, let alone Gendo Ikari?" The third monolith openly put the question to those present.  
“我们能信任任何人拥有那种力量吗，更不用说碇源堂了？”第三块巨石公开向在场的人提出了这个问题。

"Let there be order." Chairman Keel's voice sounded out over the spiraling debate. His firm voice bringing calm before he spoke again: "You know why you are here." He directed toward the bound and seated Fuyutsuki, bringing the old sensei out of his thoughts about how fractious the committee is and the smirk that would be on Gendo's face if he had been here to see it. "We hope you will cooperate professor."  
"让秩序降临。" 基尔议长的声音在激烈的辩论中响起。他坚定的声音带来了平静，随后他又说道："你们知道为什么来这里。" 他的目光转向被束缚并坐着的冬月，将这位老导师从对委员会纷争的思考中拉回，以及如果碇在这里看到这一幕，他脸上会露出的那种冷笑。"我们希望教授您能合作。"

The use of his old title, from when he had still been working in Kyoto in the time before Second Impact brought forth recollections into his mind. And as he took a trip down memory lane, remembering just how he came to be in the position he now found himself in, one word sounded in his mind.  
他旧时的称谓，让他回想起在第二次冲击之前，还在京都工作的那段时光。随着记忆的回溯，他开始回想自己是如何走到如今这个位置的，一个词在他脑海中响起。

'Yui.' '唯。'

**The Monument of Boredom, Classroom 2-A: Just after the last bell.  
无聊纪念碑，2-A 教室：最后一声铃响之后。**

Youthful voices filled the previously still and stifling air as the next generation of Tokyo-3 finally roamed free after having spent all day sat at their desks. All except the Evangelion pilots, their blueish eyes glaring daggers into the other as they had been for the last several hours.  
新一代东京-3 的年轻声音填满了之前静谧而闷热的空气，他们终于在整天坐在课桌后自由游走。除了 EVA 驾驶员们，他们那略带蓝色的眼睛在过去的几个小时里一直以锐利的目光相互对峙。

Their tryst this morning and its aftermath had succeeded in making the two of them late for school and their senile teacher had determined that a fitting punishment would be that they had to stay after school and clean classroom 2-A. This of course was on top of all the usual teenage gossip and giggling that happened whenever something even vaguely suggestive happened.  
今早的幽会及其后果使得两人上学迟到，他们那健忘的老师判定合适的惩罚是放学后留下来打扫 2-A 教室。当然，这还不包括每当发生哪怕稍微有点暗示性的事情时，那些常见的青少年八卦和窃笑。

They had bickered and yelled at the other, exchanging blame and scowls while the other students had been milling about the classroom or the nearby halls in those minutes after the bell when they gathered the books and materials they needed for their homework and the two secret lovers got the cleaning supplies from the janitorial closet.  
他们争吵着，对着对方大喊大叫，互相指责和怒视，而其他学生在铃声响起后的几分钟内，或在教室里或在附近的走廊上，整理着他们需要的书本和作业材料，而这对秘密恋人则从保洁柜里取出了清洁用品。

But once the last prying eyes had left…and the classroom door closed with a chair wedged up under the door handle for good measure. The two worked efficiently and wordlessly, getting the whole task done in under ten minutes. A record time if any had been there to see it.  
但一旦最后窥探的目光消失……教室门被一把椅子顶在门把手上，确保安全关闭。两人高效且沉默地工作，不到十分钟就完成了整个任务。如果有谁在场见证，这简直是破纪录的速度。

Asuka Langley Sohryu sighed as she wringed the rag she'd just used to wash the windows into the murky suds of a rusty bucket probably twice as old as Tokyo-3.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷叹了口气，将刚用来擦窗户的抹布拧进了一个可能比第三新东京市还要老两倍的生锈桶里的浑浊泡沫中。

She moved to stand when suddenly she felt strong hands wrap around her waist and belly and hot breath wash over her cheek and down the back of her neck. She closed her eyes an drank in the contentment she felt for a moment before opening them back up and in a flash jabbing her elbow into Shinji Ikari's side. Producing a slight yelp and a question:  
她正要起身，突然感到一双有力的手环住了她的腰腹，热气扑面而来，掠过她的脸颊，沿着后颈而下。她闭上眼睛，沉浸在这一刻的满足中，随即睁开眼，猛地用肘部撞击了身后的碇真嗣的侧腹。引来一声轻微的惊呼和一个疑问：

"What's that for?" “为什么打我？”

"Making me stay late and clean this place." Asuka said as she undid Shinji's grip on her before turning around and draping her own arms around his neck and shoulders.  
“让我加班打扫这个地方。”明日香说着，挣脱了真嗣的拥抱，转过身来，将自己的双臂搭在他的脖颈和肩膀上。

"Did you have plans?" Shinji asked, already knowing the answer, as he wrapped his hands back around her waist but left some space between them.  
"你有什么计划吗？" 真嗣问道，心里其实已经有了答案，他重新将双手环绕在她的腰间，但留出了一点距离。

"No, Hikari said she had to run an errand for her older sister." Asuka answered remembering her lunchtime conversation with her friend and confidante.  
"没有，光说她得帮她姐姐跑个腿。" 明日香回答道，回想起中午与好友兼知己的对话。

"Yeah, Kensuke's got some flyby he wants to watch, while Toji mentioned something family related." He said as he remembered absently what his friends had told him during lunch.  
"嗯，健介要看什么飞行表演，而阿薰提到了一些家庭相关的事。" 他说着，不经意间想起了午餐时朋友们告诉他的事情。

"Boring baka." Asuka said as she pressed herself up against her lover and planted a kiss on his lips.  
"无聊的笨蛋。" 明日香说着，将自己紧紧贴向爱人，并在他的唇上印下一吻。

Though as Asuka brought herself closer to Shinji she found out why the baka's head was having such a hard time working:  
然而，当明日香更靠近真嗣时，她明白了为什么这个笨蛋的脑袋会如此难以运转：

'_**Wirklich, baka?!**_' She thought as her thigh felt something stiff. She didn't stop though, instead letting their lips linger together.  
'真的，笨蛋吗？!' 她想着，当她的大腿感觉到某种坚硬的东西时。但她没有停下来，反而让他们的唇瓣继续缠绵。

While they'd been cleaning Shinji's blood had become positively boiling as he stole glances at her creamy legs and lacey blue panties that were see-through in the back and didn't leave much to the imagination. She'd normally not wear something so revealing to school, but _**someone**_ had dirtied her last normal pair of underwear and hadn't done the laundry recently. _**Shinji**_. She didn't mean to flash her panties as often as she did, but she wanted this stupid chore done and if that meant discarding the usual caution she used when those perverted boys were around then so be it. Though truth be told, she'd also been sneaking glances at his cute butt when he'd been sweeping the floor. And besides, they're lovers, they're supposed to look at the other with undisguised lust and desire.  
在打扫的过程中，真嗣的血液几乎沸腾了，因为他不时偷瞄到她那奶油色的双腿和背后透明的蓝色蕾丝内裤，这让他浮想联翩。她平时不会穿这么暴露的衣服去学校，但有人弄脏了她最后一对普通内裤，而且最近也没洗衣服。就是真嗣。她并非有意频繁地露出内裤，只是想尽快完成这烦人的家务，如果这意味着要放弃平时对那些色狼男孩的警惕，那就这样吧。不过说实话，当他在扫地时，她也在偷偷瞄着他那可爱的屁股。而且，他们是恋人，本就应该用不加掩饰的欲望和渴望注视对方。

"Pervert." Asuka teased as their lips parted, even as she pressed her thigh harder against his crotch causing her skirt to ride up and reveal the bottom part of her panties, juxtaposed against the boring colors of their uniforms.  
“色狼。”明日香调侃道，他们的唇刚刚分开，她便更用力地将大腿压在他的胯部，使得裙摆上扬，露出了内裤的下缘，与他们单调的制服形成鲜明对比。

"You're just so beautiful." Shinji said quietly, surprised he still had the capacity for words, as he brought his face near to hers. Both felt the hot breath of the other washing over and tickling their face.  
"你真是太美了。" 真嗣轻声说道，惊讶于自己还能说出话来，当他的脸靠近她的脸时。两人都感受到了对方炽热的呼吸，轻拂过并撩拨着他们的脸庞。

"Dummkopf." Asuka nearly whispered as their faces were millimeters apart just waiting for that last push to be united. Their faces joined in a blur as a flurry of passion overwhelmed their ability to do anything other than obey their teenage hormones.  
"傻瓜。" 明日香几乎耳语般地说道，他们的脸庞仅隔毫厘，只待最后一刻的推动便能合二为一。激情如狂风骤雨般席卷而来，他们的脸庞在模糊中相融，除了顺从青春的荷尔蒙冲动，他们别无选择。

Their tongues began a furious duel in the space between their linked mouths as Shinji forcefully, but not painfully, pressed her up against the wall before breaking the kiss and turning the attention of his mouth and tongue to her neck while his fingers deftly undid the buttons keeping Asuka's school uniform on. Asuka meanwhile, wasn't one for passivity, and even as goosebumps covered her arms and legs, her hands went to Shinji's waist undoing the buttons of his shirt before removing it in one swift motion. This also happened to bring Shinji's mouth to her shoulder where Shinji kissed the erogenous zone between neck and socket, sending a tingle down her spine as her back arched sympathetically.  
他们的舌头在彼此紧贴的唇间展开了一场激烈的较量，真嗣用力但并不粗暴地将她按在墙上，随后结束了这个吻，转而用嘴和舌头去探索她的脖颈，同时他的手指灵巧地解开了明日香校服上的纽扣。与此同时，明日香也不甘示弱，尽管手臂和腿上布满了鸡皮疙瘩，她的双手还是迅速地解开了真嗣衬衫的纽扣，并一把将它脱下。这一动作也恰好让真嗣的嘴移到了她的肩头，他在颈肩交界处的敏感地带轻轻一吻，激起她一阵颤栗，她的背部不由自主地弓起。

Not to let the baka have all the fun Asuka went on the offensive. She pushed the baka back so that his rear collided with a desk, filling the classroom with a screeching sound. Her face wearing a predatory grin as she took the few steps that separated them, discarding her loosened uniform on the floor so she stood in only her lacey blue bra and panties.  
不让那个笨蛋独享乐趣，明日香展开了攻势。她将笨蛋推回去，让他撞到一张桌子上，教室里顿时响起刺耳的声音。她脸上挂着掠食者的笑容，迈出几步缩短了彼此的距离，脱下松开的制服扔在地上，只穿着她那蕾丝蓝胸罩和内裤。

Her hands went all over his chest and her mouth placed feathery kisses on his sternum and chest as her lips made their way toward his left pectoral. Now it was Shinji's turn to be covered in goosebumps as he felt Asuka's sharp teeth and hot tongue on his nipple. Though he did maintain the coherence of mind necessary to undo Asuka's bra, which is no small feat.  
她的双手在他胸前游走，嘴唇在他胸骨和胸膛上留下轻柔的吻，逐渐向左胸靠近。现在轮到真嗣浑身起鸡皮疙瘩了，他感受到明日香尖锐的牙齿和炽热的舌头在他乳头上。尽管他还是保持了足够的清醒，解开了明日香的胸罩，这可不是件容易的事。

The falling silk and lace and padding revealed the twin treasures underneath. Shinji had literally seen them this morning, but still he found himself in awe of their shape and plasticity as he took them in his hands and began kneading the fleshy globes. Asuka brought her mouth up from his chest and she stole another kiss from his lips. Meanwhile Shinji's fingers twisted at both her nipples causing a muffled moan from the German redhead that broke the kiss and filled the classroom before Asuka brought a hand up to clasp her mouth shut.  
随着丝缎、蕾丝和衬垫的落下，隐藏其下的双宝终于显露。真嗣今早其实已经亲眼见过它们，但当他亲手捧起并开始揉捏那柔软的肉球时，依然被它们的形状和弹性所震撼。明日香从他的胸前抬起头，再次偷吻了他的唇。与此同时，真嗣的手指扭动着她两边的乳头，引得那位德国红发少女发出一声闷哼，打断了亲吻，声音在教室里回荡，直到明日香抬起手捂住了自己的嘴。

Shinji, using this opportunity, brought his mouth down to her chest and covered her breasts in kisses, pausing every now and then to suck on or pinch her nipples, sending moans and shivers through the redheaded lover. Her nipples standing as erect as Shinji's own member in response.  
真嗣趁此机会，将嘴凑到她的胸前，用吻覆盖了她的双乳，时不时停下来吮吸或轻捏她的乳头，让阵阵呻吟和颤抖传遍红发爱人的全身。她的乳头因反应而挺立，如同真嗣自己那勃起的部位。

Asuka couldn't take it anymore, her hands darted to his belt and began frantically working at the leather, latch, and zipper until the dark material, along with Shinji's boxers, crumpled to the floor in a useless heap. Shinji's mouth still at her chest Asuka gripped his member in her hands, stroking it.  
明日香再也忍受不住，她的手迅速伸向他的腰带，疯狂地摆弄着皮带扣和拉链，直到那深色的布料连同真嗣的内裤一起，皱巴巴地堆在地上，失去了作用。真嗣的嘴还在她的胸前，明日香则握住了他的下体，开始抚弄。

"_**Bereit**__**baka**__?_" Asuka teased. Mixing German and Japanese as she seductively whispered in his ear.  
"贝雷特贝卡？" 明日香调皮地逗弄道，她混合着德语和日语，在他耳边诱惑地低语。

"Do your worst." Shinji dared as he brought his face level with hers as the shared one more deep kiss before Asuka dropped down to her knees on the floor Shinji had just cleaned.  
"尽管放马过来吧。" 真嗣挑衅地说，将脸凑近她的，两人再次深深地吻了一下，随后明日香跪在了真嗣刚打扫干净的地板上。

Shinji should have known it was a bad idea to challenge Asuka Langley Sohryu. She had a wicked grin as she looked into the baka's cobalt eyes before bracing her hands on his hips as she lined up her mouth with his protruding member.  
真嗣本该知道，挑战惣流·明日香·兰格雷是个馊主意。她露出了一抹邪恶的笑容，凝视着那双愚蠢的钴蓝色眼睛，然后双手撑在他的腰间，将嘴对准了他挺立的部位。

Her lips opened and starting with his cockhead she worked her way down the length of his shaft. Her fingernails digging into to his skin as she choked when she was three-quarters of the way before persevering and soon her lips met the wrinkles on his balls.  
她的嘴唇张开，从他的龟头开始，一路向下吞噬着他的肉棒。她的指甲深深嵌入他的皮肤，当她吞到四分之三处时，几乎窒息，但她坚持不懈，很快她的嘴唇触碰到了他皱褶的阴囊。

She then removed her hands from his hips but kept her head bobbing up and down on his cock, trying each time to take his entire member into her mouth, and succeeding often, all the while their eyes were locked together in an unfaltering gaze. The gags this produced filled the classroom and Shinji was absently thankful they'd shut all the windows and simultaneously fearful the walls weren't soundproof enough.  
随后，她将双手从他的臀部移开，但头部依然上下起伏地含吮着他的肉棒，每次都试图将整根吞入嘴中，且常常成功，两人的目光始终紧紧相锁，不曾动摇。这种呻吟声充斥着教室，真嗣暗自庆幸他们关上了所有窗户，同时又担心墙壁的隔音效果不够好。

His cock was aching for release and Asuka was aware of the taste of salty precum on her tongue. She brought her hands out from where they had been behind her back and began to fondle at his sack as his balls tightened. Her lithe fingers dancing over the taut skin as she cupped them in her hand before she removed his member from her lips. Instead of the long, deep bobs she made before Asuka now was taking in as much of the shaft in her mouth before ferociously sucking on it as she pulled it back out, making sensual popping sounds each time with her lips. Then after several rounds of this she brought her other hand up to his shaft and placing her visage directly before his cockhead.  
他的阴茎渴望释放，而明日香能尝到她舌尖上咸咸的初精味道。她将原本背在身后的双手伸出，开始抚弄他的阴囊，随着他的睾丸紧缩。她纤细的手指在紧绷的皮肤上舞动，用手掌包裹住它们，然后从唇间抽出他的阴茎。不同于之前的长而深的吞吐，明日香现在每次都尽可能多地含入他的阴茎，然后猛烈地吸吮着将其抽出，每一次都伴随着嘴唇发出的性感啵声。经过几轮这样的动作后，她将另一只手移到他的阴茎上，并将自己的脸直接放在他的龟头前。

She vigorously stroked her hand up and down his shaft using the saliva as lubrication while her other palm massaged Shinji almost fully receded balls as his cock stood in front of her face.  
她用力地用一只手上下撸动他的阴茎，利用唾液作为润滑，而另一只手掌则按摩着几乎完全缩回的阴囊，他的阴茎就直挺挺地立在她面前。

She had to know how close he was right?  
她得知道他有多接近高潮，对吧？

'Is she going to…?' “她要……？”

"Asuka…" Shinji managed enough warning for the redhead to close her eyes before his balls unleashed their pent up load onto her face.  
“明日香……” 真嗣勉强发出警告，让红发女孩闭上眼睛，随后他的睾丸释放出积蓄已久的精液，喷洒在她脸上。

Spurts of ropey cum impacted her forehead and cheeks. Fortunately, not getting in her eye or her hair. At least at the outset, but as she moved her head, the splotch of cum on her forehead flowed onto her right eyebrow and eyelash causing the German redhead to curse a bit before wiping it away. Meanwhile the rest of the cum had begun flowing down her cheeks to her chin, Shinji mesmerized by the sight of it and even noticing a bit on her nose that he couldn't remember how it got there.  
一股股粘稠的精液击中她的额头和脸颊。幸运的是，一开始并没有进入她的眼睛或头发，但随着她移动头部，额头上的精液流到了她的右眉和睫毛上，让这位德国红发女孩咒骂了几句，然后擦掉。与此同时，其余的精液开始顺着她的脸颊流到下巴，真嗣被这一幕迷住了，甚至注意到她鼻子上的一点精液，他不记得是怎么弄上去的。

Now Shinji had cum on her face before, but usually on accident through circumstance. This was different though. This time she had purposely done it.  
虽然真嗣之前曾在她脸上射过，但通常都是意外情况。不过这次不同。这一次，她是故意这么做的。

She told herself it was to avoid any traces of his cum being inside her for the synch-test tomorrow, since she usually swallowed. Well, that may have been _one_ of the reasons, but really, she knew Shinji wanted it, and she wanted to make his fantasies come true. Why was that? Was it because she loved him and derived pleasure from his satisfaction? Was it a quid pro quo for all the things he did for her? Or maybe was she afraid his eyes would wander to some hussy who'd let him do all the perverted things he looked at in those magazines he thought she didn't know about? Maybe a mixture of all the above as her love and lingering, though still greatly reduced, insecurity blended together in the decisions of her conscious mind. Asuka wasn't really sure, but she didn't regret it, not for a moment.  
她告诉自己这么做是为了避免明天同步测试时体内残留他的精液，因为她通常会吞下去。嗯，这可能是原因之一，但真正的原因是，她知道真嗣想要这样，而她想让他的幻想成真。为什么会这样呢？是因为她爱他，从他的满足中获得快乐吗？还是为了回报他为她所做的一切？或者，她害怕他的目光会飘向某个放荡的女人，让他在那些他认为她不知道的杂志上看到的变态事情成真？也许以上都有，她的爱和依然存在但已大大减少的不安全感在她的意识中交织在一起。明日香并不十分确定，但她从未后悔过，一刻也没有。

Asuka was broken out of her introspection by strong hands lifting her up and placing her on her back on the school desk Shinji's movement had skewed out of the row. His hands quickly removing the last article of clothing from her body before she had a chance to protest.  
明日香被一双有力的手从沉思中唤醒，那双手将她抬起，让她仰面躺在真嗣挪出队列的课桌上。他的手迅速脱去了她身上的最后一件衣物，她还没来得及抗议。

Shinji's mouth danced over her abdomen placing kisses on either side of her bellybutton, where he knew her ovaries were under her sensitive skin while his hands went to her most private place to stimulate her petals. His fingers started out with the sensitive nub of her clitoris, sending lightning through the German redhead's body and renewed wetness inside her.  
真嗣的唇在她腹部游走，在她肚脐两侧留下吻痕，他知道那里是她敏感肌肤下的卵巢位置，而他的手则伸向她最私密的地方，轻抚她的花瓣。他的手指首先触碰到了她阴蒂的敏感小点，电流般的快感贯穿了这位德国红发少女的身体，让她再次湿润起来。

Judging she was wet enough Shinji placed his right index finger at her opening while Asuka's hands pulled at the hair on his head as his lips continued to leave a path of kisses on her belly.  
判断她已经足够湿润后，真嗣将右手的食指放在她的入口处，而明日香的手则拉扯着他头顶的头发，他的唇继续在她腹部留下一串吻痕。

His digit penetrated, splitting her moistened, hairless labia as it went in one joint at a time. Once it was inside, he began swirling the finger in a spiral around her insides as he searched for the telltale twitch in her body that told him he'd found a sensitive area. As his fingers found a wrinkle crease inside Asuka he was rewarded not just by a twitch but a hitching yelp as Asuka responded to his touch. Shinji then began to curl his finger inside to maximize contact with the erogenous spot in her rapidly heating and wetting hole.  
他的手指探入，分开她湿润无毛的阴唇，一节节地深入。一旦进入，他便开始在她的体内螺旋状旋转手指，寻找她身体中预示着敏感区域被触发的细微抽搐。当他的手指在明日香体内找到一处皱褶时，他不仅得到了一次抽搐的回应，还有明日香因触碰而发出的急促叫声。随后，真嗣开始在她的洞穴内弯曲手指，以最大化接触到她迅速升温并湿润的敏感点。

As Asuka's breath became more strained and he paused in his kisses to see her biting her lip, Shinji put a second finger into her and changed tactic. Now his fingers, rather than curling, began to thrust in and out of her, striking more of her insides as they exited to just below his fingernails with each swift stroke. Her breath now was well and truly hitching, her earlier attempt to stay quiet was abandoned at this fresh onslaught that was bringing her to the edge of climax.  
随着明日香的呼吸愈发急促，真嗣暂停了亲吻，看到她咬着嘴唇，便将第二根手指伸入她体内，改变了策略。现在，他的手指不再弯曲，而是开始在她体内来回抽插，每次快速抽出时都触及到指尖下方的更多部位。她的呼吸已经完全变得急促，先前试图保持安静的努力在这新一轮的冲击下被彻底放弃，她正被推向高潮的边缘。

Her heavy breathing mercifully didn't last long though as Shinji felt her tighten around his fingers at the same time as her fingernails dug into his scalp and she felt like she was going to bite through her lip as she barely suppressed a croaking moan, brought on by her orgasm, that definitely would have been noticed.  
她沉重的呼吸并未持续太久，因为真嗣感觉到她的紧缩环绕着他的手指，同时她的指甲深深陷入他的头皮，她几乎要咬破嘴唇，勉强压抑住因高潮而引发的嘶哑呻吟，那声音肯定会被人察觉。

Asuka turned her face to stare up at the ceiling she knew well, it being more interesting than most of the old sensei's lectures, as she came down from her high. Though she was halted from further reflection as she felt the baka's fingers leave her to be soon replaced by a new pressure on her entrance.  
明日香转过头，凝视着她再熟悉不过的天花板，比起老教授的大部分讲座，这显得更有趣。当她从高潮的余韵中回过神来时，却被那笨蛋的手指离开的感觉打断，随即感受到新的压力在她入口处出现。

'Baka's ready again.' Asuka thought as she knew what the feeling on her lower lips was. 'Well so am I.' She determined as she shifted her ass on a desk whose owner she couldn't remember and spread her legs to accommodate Shinji between them.  
'笨蛋又准备好了。' 明日香心想，她知道那种感觉来自她的下唇。'好吧，我也准备好了。' 她决定，挪动臀部坐在一个她记不起主人的桌子上，张开双腿，为真嗣腾出空间。

She brought her eyes back down and looked into Shinji's cobalt orbs with her cerulean globes. They stayed like that for a moment, with Shinji's member lined up at her opening but not penetrating, until Asuka's lips formed into a smile which Shinji returned with one of his trademarked awkward grins.  
她将目光重新垂下，用她那蔚蓝的眼眸凝视着真嗣的钴蓝色眼珠。他们就这样对视了一会儿，真嗣的成员对准了她的入口却未曾深入，直到明日香的双唇绽放出微笑，真嗣也回以他标志性的尴尬笑容。

"I love you Asuka." Shinji said as his words broke the silence, and despite everything, engendered a bright blush on the redhead's cheeks.  
“我爱你，明日香。”真嗣打破了沉默，尽管一切如此，他的话语还是在红发少女的脸颊上染上了一抹绯红。

"Baka, get on with it." Asuka responded in her own way. Though Shinji knew her well enough to know she wasn't saying it with malice or boredom.  
“笨蛋，快点开始吧。”明日香以自己的方式回应道。虽然真嗣足够了解她，知道她并非出于恶意或厌倦。

Shinji answered her words with his own actions, pushing his member past her lower lips and the entrance to her insides. First his cockhead, then his entire shaft slid in until he was hilted into her moist hole. He went gentle at first, shallow slow strokes as he knew her insides were still sensitive after having just came.  
真嗣用行动回应了她的话，将他的分身推过她的下唇和体内的入口。先是他的龟头，然后是整个阴茎滑入，直到他深深插入她湿润的私处。起初他很温柔，浅浅的慢速抽插，因为他知道她刚高潮过，体内还很敏感。

His hands went back to her breasts, gripping her fleshy mounds for support as his rhythm began to pick up and Asuka's breath responded by hitching in her throat as her insides felt his rock-hard erection going ever deeper into her.  
他的手回到她的乳房上，紧握着她丰满的肉团以支撑，随着节奏加快，明日香的呼吸也随之在喉咙中一滞，她感觉到他坚硬的勃起越来越深入她的体内。

To Shinji it felt as if her pussy was trying to suck him in and not let go it was so tight. Her walls pressed in on his shaft from all sides as he continued to thrust in and out of her, though only getting about half of his member out each time.  
对真嗣来说，感觉就像她的阴道在试图吸住他不放，紧得令人难以置信。她的肉壁从四面八方挤压着他的阴茎，他继续在她体内抽插，尽管每次只能抽出一半的长度。

He looked her up and down. Soft legs leading to spread hips around her glistening labia as he watched his cock separating them as he stroked into her. Her stomach and chest seemed to be spasming, as her diaphragm desperately tried to impose some kind of order on her breathing while her arms went up to his shoulders, bracing herself as he thrust into her causing her ass and thighs to shake in response. Then he saw her face. Her perfect face, lost in ecstasy, eyes glazed over and mouth agape as he felt her tightening around him and knew she was close.  
他上下打量着她。柔软的双腿延伸至张开的臀部，环绕着她闪闪发光的阴唇，他看着自己的阴茎在她体内抽动，分开那两片柔软。她的腹部和胸部似乎在痉挛，横膈膜拼命试图控制她的呼吸，而她的双臂则向上搭在他的肩膀上，支撑着自己，随着他的深入，她的臀部和大腿随之颤抖。然后他看到了她的脸。她那完美的脸庞，迷失在极乐之中，眼神迷离，嘴巴微张，他感觉到她在紧缩，知道她即将达到高潮。

The sight and feel of the whole thing was euphoric and he desperately fought back the urge to cum in response to the bliss he felt, wanting her to reach her peak as well.  
这一切的景象和感觉都令人陶醉，他拼命压抑着随之而来的高潮冲动，渴望她也能达到巅峰。

He didn't have to wait long as she soon reached her crescendo for the third time that day.  
他没等多久，她很快就在那天第三次达到了高潮的顶峰。

Shinji knew when he saw her mouth silently, well mostly silently, open on her cum-covered face and felt her entire body shaking. He was grateful since he couldn't hold on much longer and gave one last deep thrust into her before taking his member out of her just as his self-control failed. His aching balls let loose his seed and the milky-white substance shot on either side of her bellybutton in two big splotches that joined together a Asuka's panting breaths caused them to flow down into the abdominal orifice.  
真嗣知道，当他看到她的嘴无声地，大部分是无声地，张开在她那满是精液的脸上，感受到她整个身体都在颤抖时。他很感激，因为他也坚持不了多久了，在自我控制失效前，他最后一次深深地刺入她，然后抽出自己的肉棒。他疼痛的睾丸释放出种子，乳白色的液体在她肚脐两侧喷射出两大块，随着明日香急促的呼吸，它们汇聚在一起，流入了腹部的孔洞。

He leaned back as he beheld the sight of her lying on her back, on one of their school desks, with her face still covered in cum and her belly coated in a fresh load.  
他向后靠去，凝视着她躺在学校的一张课桌上，脸庞仍被精液覆盖，腹部则涂满了新鲜的精液。

He could look at that scene all day, and probably would have if not for Asuka's words:  
他可以整天看着这一幕，如果不是明日香的话：

"Could you hand me a towel Shinji." Asuka asked as she raised up an expectant hand.  
“你能递给我一条毛巾吗，真嗣。”明日香问道，举起一只期待的手。

"Right." Shinji said and began moving. He didn't find a clean towel, but he found a box of tissues and handed them to his lover who was now sat up on the desk. The baka stood and stared at the sight of the German redhead wiping away the semen from her body before an irritated Asuka berated him:  
“好的。”真嗣应道，开始行动。他没有找到干净的毛巾，但找到了一盒纸巾，递给了此刻正坐在桌上的恋人。这个笨蛋站着，盯着德国红发女孩用纸巾擦拭身上的精液，直到明日香不耐烦地责备他：

"Want to take a picture too?" Asuka asked as she wiped away the last of the cum on her cheeks with a tissue.  
“还想拍照留念吗？”明日香问道，用纸巾擦去脸颊上最后一丝精液。

"No!" Shinji said, quickly looking away, his face blushing as bright as her hair.  
"不！" 真嗣说道，迅速移开视线，他的脸颊红得如同她的头发一样。

"I don't mind you staring baka," Asuka began as she got up and walked to Shinji and he looked at the soft smile on her face as she continued, "but there has to be something here." Asuka said as her finger pointed at Shinji's chest and his heart beneath.  
"我不介意你盯着看，笨蛋，" 明日香开始说道，她起身走向真嗣，他看着她脸上温柔的微笑，她继续说，"但这里一定有什么。" 明日香说着，手指指向真嗣的胸膛，以及他胸膛下跳动的心。

"Right." Shinji said with a smile as they both unconsciously brought their lips together and shared a kiss that told the other of their commitment to knowing the other body and soul.  
"没错。" 真嗣微笑着说，他们俩不自觉地将嘴唇凑在一起，分享了一个吻，这个吻向对方表达了他们对彼此身心相知的承诺。

Eventually the kiss ended, and the two lovers got cleaned up and dressed. They gathered their school bags and other belongings, along with the borrowed cleaning supplies, unblocked the door and returned the chair to its proper place before opening the door to reveal a flailing Toji Suzuhara. Who, as luck would have it, had been preparing to knock on the door the exact moment Shinji opened it, causing him to almost fall through the now open door, only narrowly avoiding crashing into the "Red Devil" and instead ending up on the floor.  
终于，亲吻结束了，两位恋人整理好自己，穿戴整齐。他们收拾好书包和其他物品，连同借来的清洁用品一起，移开堵门的椅子，将其归位，然后打开门，映入眼帘的是正在手舞足蹈的铃原东治。说来也巧，就在真嗣开门的那一刻，东治正准备敲门，结果差点一头栽进已经敞开的门里，险些撞上“红发恶魔”，最后还是跌坐在了地上。

"Stooge! What the hell?!" Asuka said in her characteristic fashion while Shinji helped his friend up.  
“笨蛋！搞什么鬼啊？！”明日香一如既往地喊道，而真嗣则帮忙扶起他的朋友。

"What is it Toji?" Shinji asked now noticing how heavily the Fourth Child was breathing.  
“怎么了，东治？”真嗣问道，这时他注意到第四适格者呼吸异常急促。

"I was visiting my grandad at the lab today, before going to see my sister, and he said he saw Miss Misato being escorted by two of those Section 2 creeps." The tracksuit wearing jock blurted out in a garbled mass of words between panting breaths before uttering what it all meant: "Something's wrong Shinji."  
"今天我去实验室看爷爷，然后打算去看姐姐，他告诉我他看到 Misato 小姐被两个第二分部的家伙带走了。" 穿着运动服的运动员喘着粗气，急促地吐出一串话，最后说出了关键："出事了，真嗣。"

**Gendo's Esoteric Office: Less than an hour Later  
碇源堂的密室：不到一小时后**

"Where is she?!" Shinji Ikari demanded as he entered his father's demesne.  
"她在哪儿？！" 真嗣·碇一进门就质问他的父亲。

"If you are referring to the Operations Director, she is in Isolation Facility 4." The bearded man with a guarded pose stated as the younger Ikari came forward with a determined stride.  
"如果你指的是运营总监，她在第四隔离设施。" 留着胡须的男子保持着戒备的姿态说道，年轻的碇真嗣则以坚定的步伐走上前来。

"Why is Miss Misato imprisoned?" Shinji asked in a harsh tone, as he stood, hands clenched directly in front of Gendo's desk instead of the usual twenty meters Gendo used to intimidate. For some reason Shinji did not understand the guards had only permitted him entry. Though he guessed it was probably a form of manipulation by Gendo, perhaps he believed if he showed favoritism to Shinji, it would drive a wedge between the united front of NERV's two premier pilots. But he was sure it was not due to any care or love within that bastard's heart.  
"为什么美里小姐会被监禁？" 真嗣用严厉的语气问道，他站在碇源堂办公桌前，双手紧握，而不是像往常那样站在二十米外以躲避碇源堂的威压。不知为何，真嗣不明白为什么警卫只允许他进入。尽管他猜测这可能是碇源堂的一种操纵手段，也许他认为如果对真嗣表现出偏爱，会在这两位 NERV 顶尖驾驶员之间制造裂痕。但他确信，这绝不是因为那个混蛋心中有任何关怀或爱意。

"Major Katsuragi is being detained for reasons that don't concern you." Gendo Ikari, Supreme Commander of NERV, said through steepled hands in his quintessential calm tone.  
"葛城美里少校被拘留的原因与你无关。" NERV 最高指挥官碇源堂说道，双手交叠，语气一如既往地平静。

"She is my **guardian**, _**Father**_." The venom oozing from Shinji's voice as his mouth forced out the final word filled the office with a sense of malice as Shinji's hands unclenched and slammed into Gendo's desk, though if this display of dissatisfaction affected Gendo he did not show it.  
"她是我的监护人，父亲。" 真嗣的声音中渗出的毒液随着他口中最后一个字的强行吐露，让办公室充满了恶意。尽管真嗣的双手松开并猛击在源渡的桌子上，但这一不满的展示似乎并未影响到源渡，他并未表现出任何反应。

"Another guardian can be arranged for you and the Second Child…" Gendo began before removing his hands to his chair's armrests before continuing, "…or would you prefer to live alone?"  
"可以为你和第二适格者安排另一位监护人……" 源渡开始说道，然后将双手移到椅子的扶手上，继续道，"……或者你更愿意独自生活？"

Shinji was unsure if this was a threat. Unsure if his father was aware of his and Asuka's relationship. This unknown gave Shinji pause, though he tried his damndest not to give away just how far his heart had sunk at those words.  
真嗣不确定这是否是一种威胁。不确定他的父亲是否知道他和明日香的关系。这种未知让真嗣停顿了一下，尽管他竭尽全力不让自己暴露出听到这些话时内心沉沦的程度。

"That will not be necessary." Shinji answered through gritted teeth his tone bitter.  
“那就不必了。”真嗣咬牙切齿地回答，语气中带着苦涩。

"If that is all then please inform Pilot Sohryu that the next synch test will proceed as scheduled." Gendo said as Shinji removed his hands from Gendo's desk back to his sides where they clenched and unclenched several times before Shinji turned around and left the NERV Director alone in his office.  
“如果这就是全部，那么请通知驾驶员惣流，下一次同步测试将按计划进行。”碇源堂说道，真嗣将双手从碇源堂的桌子上移开，回到身体两侧，紧握又松开数次，随后转身离开了 NERV 指挥官的办公室。

Gendo Ikari released a sigh after several moments of being alone in his kabbalah covered domain, something he never did even in front of the old sensei. Afterwards he pulled out a key he kept on his person at all times and opened up the drawer in his desk where his most precious possession lay. An old, fading photograph of a mother and child.  
碇源堂独自在他的卡巴拉覆盖的领域中待了片刻后，叹了口气，这是他即使在老导师面前也从未做过的事。随后，他拿出一直随身携带的钥匙，打开办公桌的抽屉，里面是他最珍贵的宝物——一张泛黄的老照片，上面是一位母亲和孩子的合影。

"He really is our son." He said as he looked at the last surviving image of Yui Ikari on the planet. He had thought about destroying it along with the others, but he just couldn't.  
"他真的是我们的儿子。" 他看着地球上唯一幸存的碇唯影像说道。他曾想过与其他的影像一起毁掉它，但他就是做不到。

"I have to succeed, so we can be together again." Gendo said, his usual sternness absent from his voice as his eyes looked back and forth between the love of his life and that love incarnate. "Then you'll understand." He said as he carefully laid the photograph back in the drawer again locking it away like he had his own heart.  
"我必须成功，这样我们才能再次团聚。" 碇源堂说道，他平时严厉的语气中没有出现，目光在爱人和这份爱的化身之间来回游移。"然后你会明白的。" 他说着，小心翼翼地将照片放回抽屉，再次锁起来，就像他把自己的心也锁起来一样。

**NERV HQ, Isolation Facility 4: Some Time Later  
NERV 总部，隔离设施 4：一段时间后**

"Is it over?" Misato Katsuragi asked as the door to the cell she was in opened flooding the dark room with a light that stung her eyes.  
“结束了吗？” 碇真嗣问道，随着他所在牢房的门打开，黑暗的房间被涌入的光线照亮，刺痛了他的眼睛。

"Yes. A solution to the problem has been found." The suit-wearing agent said rather vaguely before continuing: "Thank you for your cooperation." He finished as he held out a tray with her NERV ID and sidearm. Misato took her proffered possessions wordlessly and walked out of the deep dark pit NERV used for unruly pilots and other problems that needed to go away. Her brain already knowing exactly where she needed to be while her heart hoped that it wasn't too late.  
“是的。问题的解决方案已经找到了。” 穿着西装的特工含糊地说道，然后继续说：“感谢您的合作。” 他一边说着，一边递给她一个托盘，上面放着她的 NERV ID 和手枪。真嗣默默地接过这些物品，走出了 NERV 用来关押不守规矩的驾驶员和其他需要消失的问题人物的深暗牢房。他的大脑已经清楚地知道他需要去哪里，而他的心则希望这一切还不算太晚。

**Tokyo-3 Outskirts: Ventilation Room 6

"Oh hi, you're a little late, aren't you?" The badly groomed spy called out as he turned around to face the contact who'd he'd arranged to meet after the business with the Vice-Commander was concluded.  
“哦，嗨，你有点迟到了，不是吗？”这位不修边幅的间谍大声喊道，他转过身来面对着那个他安排在副指挥官事务结束后会面的联系人。

The usually verbose informant was silent however, his hand tucked in his coat pocket as he stood in the doorway. He'd hoped to take the associate-turned-loose-end from behind before he even knew he was there. That plan now impossible, Kaji's former collaborator instead opted for speed and yanked his arm clutching his weapon out as fast as his muscles could carry.  
然而，这位平时健谈的线人此刻却沉默不语，手插在大衣口袋里站在门口。他本希望在对方察觉到他的存在之前，从背后解决这个由合作伙伴变成隐患的家伙。现在这个计划已不可能，卡吉的前合作者转而选择了速度，以最快的肌肉反应将握着武器的手臂猛地抽出。

Three shots rang out, the shrill sound of the bullets echoing off the old concrete walls and down rusting pipes as a body crumpled to the floor.  
三声枪响回荡开来，子弹尖锐的声响在老旧的混凝土墙和锈迹斑斑的管道间回响，一具身体随之瘫倒在地板上。

"Thanks, Katsuragi." The unshaven spy said to his lover coming out from her position overwatching the room.  
"谢谢，葛城。" 这位胡子拉碴的间谍对他的爱人说道，她刚从监视房间的位置走出来。

"You damn fool." Misato said, putting away her pistol that felt so much lighter in her hands now, though not from the missing bullets in the magazine. Kaji wasn't listening though, he was busy rummaging through the unlucky bastard's pockets as his lifeblood pooled on the floor from two shots center mass and one that passed through his grey matter.  
"你这个蠢货。" 美里说道，将她手中感觉轻了许多的手枪收起，尽管这并非因为弹匣中少了子弹。但加持没在听，他正忙着翻找那个倒霉鬼的口袋，那人的生命之血正从两枪中心脏和一枪穿过脑部的伤口中涌出，汇聚在地板上。

"Ah, here you are." Kaji said as he found what he was looking for, a small transmitter, to send the signal that the job was done, to the dead man's superiors.  
"啊，找到了。" 加持说道，他找到了他要找的东西——一个小型发射器，用来向死者的上级发送任务完成的信号。

The button pressed the two of them then set out to processing Kaji's would-be assassin, removing any documents or belongings that might be able to identify him. Had they really wanted to delay that process, and been incredibly sadistic, they could have knocked out all his teeth and cut off all his fingertips to obfuscate any dental or fingerprint records, leaving DNA as the only viable means. But they had neither the time nor the willingness, instead dumping the body deep down a ventilation shaft that hadn't seen a maintenance worker in six months.  
按钮按下后，两人便着手处理加治的潜在暗杀者，移除任何可能用于识别他的文件或物品。如果他们真想拖延这一过程，并且极其残忍，本可以敲掉他所有的牙齿，切断所有指尖，以混淆任何牙科或指纹记录，仅留下 DNA 作为唯一可行的手段。但他们既没有时间也没有意愿，而是将尸体丢进了一个六个月未见维修工的通风井深处。

"I'll be going now." Kaji said once the deed was done as he theatrically wiped his hands before his tone turned serious as he looked into her dark eyes. "Remember Katsuragi, the truth is with you." The spy said, referencing the last gift he had given her, one he could not use, but which she might be able to.  
“我这就走了。”加治在事情完成后说道，他戏剧性地擦了擦手，然后语气变得严肃，凝视着她深邃的眼睛。“记住，葛城，真相与你同在。”间谍说道，提及他最后送给她的礼物，一件他无法使用，但她或许能用的东西。

"Kaji…" Misato began before the spy, throwing caution to the wind gave voice to the words that eight years ago he found he could not say.  
“加治……”美里开口道，而间谍不顾一切，说出了八年前他发现自己无法说出口的话。

"I love you." "我爱你。"

He took the purple-haired Major in a tight embrace before the two shared a kiss. Conveying with it all the feelings and words they had no time to say. His lips said he wanted to live, to come back to her, and hers said that she'd be waiting for him.  
他紧紧拥抱着那位紫发的少校，两人随后深情一吻。这一吻，传递了所有来不及诉说的情感与话语。他的唇语表达着想要活下去、回到她身边的愿望，而她的唇语则承诺会一直等待他。

"Sayonara, Misato." “再见，美里。”

"Sayonara, Ryoji." “再见，碇。”

**A/N:** Well, here we are, the episode defined by memories has them utterly absent here since I figured they wouldn't change. For those surprised by the end, I've been telegraphing this change since the third chapter. For those not surprised, let me know what you thought of this chapter. It's mostly filler to move the plot along but next time will be Arael. That battle will be…different.  
作者注：好吧，我们来到了这一集，本应由回忆定义的篇章却完全缺失了它们，因为我设想它们不会改变。对于那些对结局感到惊讶的读者，我从第三章就开始暗示这一变化了。而对于那些并不意外的读者，欢迎告诉我你们对这一章的看法。这章主要是为了推动剧情而填充的内容，但下一次将是与 Arael 的对决。那场战斗将会……与众不同。

### Chapter 12 Pathos

**Katsuragi Apartment: Evening  
葛城公寓：傍晚**

The mood in the Katsuragi household was cheerful and lively as the namesake purple-head and her two wards gathered to sit around the kitchen table.  
葛城家的气氛欢快而热闹，以紫色头发的葛城美里为首，她和她的两个养子围坐在厨房餐桌旁。

Asuka Langley Sohryu, Second Child and designated pilot of Unit-02 had just set a pot of German _Kartofelsuppe_ on the table, while Shinji Ikari with his mitted hands opened the oven to fill the apartment with the unmistakable smell of freshly baked pumpernickel. Where Shinji had found the rye flour to make the famous German bread she had no idea, since even in the best of times rye flour was uncommon in Japan, let alone the course ground needed for pumpernickel.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷，二号适格者兼 02 号机指定驾驶员，刚刚将一锅德国土豆汤放在桌上，而戴着隔热手套的碇真嗣则打开烤箱，让公寓里弥漫着新鲜出炉的德国黑麦面包的独特香气。明日香不知道真嗣是从哪儿找到制作这种著名德国面包的黑麦粉的，因为在日本，即便是最好的时期，黑麦粉也不常见，更不用说制作黑麦面包所需的粗磨粉了。

She opened the lid and closed her eyes as the hearty aroma filled her nostrils with warmth and nostalgia. Memories of home and family flooded her mind's eye, as she reached out and grabbed the warm hand of the one who'd helped her to learn how to just be Asuka.  
她打开盖子，闭上眼睛，那浓郁的香气温暖而怀旧地填满了她的鼻腔。家的记忆和亲人的身影涌入她的脑海，她伸出手，紧紧握住了那个教会她如何成为真正的明日香的人的温暖手掌。

"Smells good _liebling._" The German redhead said as Shinji put a plate with the freshly sliced and visibly steaming dark bread next to the soup pot.  
“闻起来真香，亲爱的。”德国红发女孩说道，此时真嗣将一盘刚切好、冒着热气的黑面包放在了汤锅旁。

"Yeah!" Misato said excitedly as she finished downing her second beer of the evening in what had to be a new record. "Sure does!" The NERV Major said as, without missing a beat she tossed her empty can into the trash and held up her soup bowl expectantly to the resident chef, a broad smile covering her face.  
“没错！”美里兴奋地说道，她今晚以创纪录的速度喝完了第二罐啤酒。“确实很香！”NERV 的少校说着，毫不间断地将空罐子扔进垃圾桶，然后举起汤碗，满面笑容地期待着主厨的下一道菜。

Shinji smiled wordlessly and began ladling soup into everyone's bowls, even Pen Pen's, before retrieving another beer and a can of soda from the fridge for the two women in his life before the three people and one warm-water penguin dug into their meals.  
真嗣微笑着默默无言，开始给大家的碗里盛汤，包括 Pen Pen 的份，然后从冰箱里又拿了一罐啤酒和一罐汽水给生活中的两位女性，之后三个人和一只温水企鹅才开始享用晚餐。

The three roommates all had different methods when it came to their dinner. Shinji opted for the traditional approach of eating spoonsful of soup while intermittently taking a bite of bread. Asuka on the other hand tore her bread into pieces, tossed them into the soup to cool it, before ferociously devouring it as fast as her hands and mouth would move. While Misato alternated between taking a swig of cold beer and spoon of hot soup that made one wonder how the nerves connecting her teeth to her mouth still had any feeling. Pen Pen mostly picked at the soup but enthusiastically ate the dark bread Shinji had placed to the side, washing it down with his own can of Yebisu.  
三位室友在晚餐时各有不同的吃法。真嗣选择了传统的吃法，一边吃着汤勺里的汤，一边不时咬一口面包。而明日香则把面包撕成小块，扔进汤里冷却，然后以尽可能快的速度凶猛地吃掉。至于美里，她交替着喝一口冰啤酒和一勺热汤，让人不禁好奇她牙齿到嘴巴的神经是否还有感觉。Pen Pen 主要挑着汤里的食物吃，但对真嗣放在一旁的深色面包却热情满满，还用他自己的惠比寿啤酒送下肚。

Asuka naturally was soon done with her bowl and with another piece of bread hurriedly sopped up all the last bits of vegetable and broth that remained. She wasn't sure if the flavors were like her mother's or not. Truth be told she couldn't really remember; the taste and smell were like a phantom in her consciousness.  
明日香自然很快就吃完了她的碗，又急忙用另一片面包吸干了剩下的所有蔬菜和汤汁。她不确定这味道是否像她母亲做的。说实话，她真的记不清了；那味道和气味在她意识中如同幻影。

What wasn't a phantom however was her stomach telling her she was still hungry as her eyes informed her that her soup was gone and not a morsel remained. Likewise, across the table Misato made a horrifying discovery.  
然而，她的胃告诉她自己仍然饿着，这一点并非幻觉，她的眼睛告诉她汤已经没了，一点残渣都不剩。同样，在桌子对面，美里也有一个可怕的发现。

"Shinji!" Both women called out at the same time, Asuka holding her empty bowl to Shinji while Misato's hand shook her can from which all the beer had "magically" evaporated.  
“真嗣！”两位女士同时喊道，明日香举着空碗对着真嗣，而美里的手颤抖着摇晃着那罐“神奇”蒸发掉所有啤酒的易拉罐。

"Uhhh…" The seated baka hesitated as his eyes darted between his two human roommates.  
"呃……" 坐在椅子上的笨蛋犹豫着，目光在两位人类室友之间来回游移。

"Hmpf!" Asuka harrumphed impatiently as she got up from her chair, stood in front of Shinji, empty bowl in her hands, before spinning around and planting herself squarely on Shinji's lap. Her legs were parallel to the side of the table and their eyes were looking into the other's before she turned her face away and she began ladling soup into her own bowl before turning her attention back to the baka she was sitting on.  
"哼！" 明日香不耐烦地哼了一声，从椅子上站起来，手里拿着空碗站在真嗣面前，然后转过身，稳稳地坐在真嗣的腿上。她的腿与桌子平行，两人的目光在彼此之间交汇，然后她转过头去，开始往自己的碗里舀汤，随后又将注意力转回到坐在她身下的笨蛋身上。

"More soup baka?" Asuka asked in her most seductive voice and pushing her chest much closer than necessary to Shinji's face to retrieve his still half full bowl.  
"还要汤吗，笨蛋？" 明日香用她最诱人的声音问道，并将胸部过分靠近真嗣的脸，去拿他那还剩一半的碗。

Shinji merely nodded as Asuka, giggling in her blue skirt and sleeveless top ladled some more soup for her Shinji.  
真嗣只是点了点头，看着明日香穿着蓝色裙子和无袖上衣，咯咯笑着为他盛了更多汤。

"Thank you Asuka." he said as she put the full bowl down in front of him.  
“谢谢你，明日香。”他说，而她将盛满的碗放在他面前。

"You're welcome baka." Asuka said as she snatched a kiss from his lips before she picked her own bowl of soup up in her hands, got a big spoonful of it, and extended the utensil to in front of Shinji's mouth, her intent obvious.  
“不客气，笨蛋。”明日香说着，从他唇上偷了个吻，然后拿起自己的汤碗，舀了一大勺汤，伸到真嗣嘴前，意图明显。

'Ugghh. There must be something in the air.' Misato rued as she watched the display of the two teenage lovers feeding each other. 'Am I sure I want to be living here and breathing it in?' She half-heartedly asked herself as a snicker escaped her mouth as she got up from her chair. Deciding that if there was a pathogen in the air her blood needed more alcohol in it.  
'呃，空气中肯定有什么东西。' 美里抱怨着，看着两个青少年恋人互相喂食的场景。'我真确定要住在这里并吸入这些吗？' 她半心半意地自问，同时从椅子上起身，忍不住轻笑出声。她决定，如果空气中真有病原体，她的血液更需要酒精来中和。

Her can of hoppy refreshment filled the kitchen with a popping sound before she downed half of it on her return trip to the table, her eye twitching slightly as she saw Shinji with a napkin in hand wiping away some stray soup from Asuka's pink lips, the two of them sharing giggling smiles that were making their cheeks hurt.  
她手中的啤酒罐在厨房里发出“嘭”的一声，随后她回到桌边，一口气喝掉了半罐，眼角微微抽搐，因为她看到真嗣正拿着餐巾纸，轻轻擦去明日香粉嫩唇边的一些汤渍，两人共享着让脸颊发疼的欢笑。

"You outdid yourself on the bread baka." Asuka said as she held a piece in front of Shinji's mouth, only to steal it away and eat it herself.  
“你这次做的面包真是太棒了，笨蛋。”明日香说着，将一片面包举到真嗣嘴边，却又突然抢走，自己吃了起来。

"Thanks, Asuka, this soup is delicious as well." Shinji said as he gestured toward the pot before he brought his hand up to her cheek, looked deeply into her cerulean orbs and kissed her bare lips as Misato decided she couldn't remain silent and let this golden opportunity for teasing slip by.  
"谢谢，明日香，这汤也很美味。" 真嗣说着，指向锅子，然后抬起手轻抚她的脸颊，深深凝视着她那蔚蓝的眼眸，吻上了她裸露的唇瓣，而美里觉得她不能再沉默，让这个调侃的黄金机会溜走。

"Jeez, you're still at it? You know traditionally in Japan kissing was something as intimate as sex, done only outside the public eye." Misato said as her backside crashed into her chair with gravity's full force as her muscles decided to be lazy.  
"哎呀，你们还在继续啊？你知道在日本传统中，亲吻和性一样亲密，只能在私下进行。" 美里说着，重重地坐进椅子，重力完全作用在她懒散的肌肉上。

"So that's why there wasn't a word for it." Asuka absently responded through a giggle as she remembered her language lessons.  
"所以这就是为什么没有这个词。" 明日香带着一丝笑意不经意地回应，想起了她的语言课。

"Yep." Misato began as she sat cross-legged on the chair opposite her wards before continuing: "I'd tell you to do it in private if I didn't think it might make you _louder_."  
"没错。" 美里盘腿坐在对面椅子上，开始说道，"如果我不认为那会让你们更大声的话，我会建议你们私下做。"

"Misato!" Both teenagers' faces were red with embarrassment at Misato's innuendo.  
"美里！" 两个少年都被她的暗示弄得满脸通红，尴尬不已。

"And then nine months after that the apartment would be _really_ loud, and cramped. We'd probably have to move Pen Pen out to make room for the little rascal." Their guardian continued in her matter-of-fact teasing tone, her eyes closed, and face tilted toward the ceiling as she enjoyed the feeling of discomfort her teasing caused.  
"然后九个月后，公寓会变得非常吵闹和拥挤。我们可能得把 Pen Pen 挪出去，给小家伙腾地方。" 他们的监护人继续用她那实事求是的揶揄语气说道，闭着眼睛，脸朝天花板，享受着她的调侃带来的不适感。

"Wark?!" Pen Pen responded to his owner in a tone and posture that Shinji could swear looked like he was sweat dropping.  
"呱？" 企鹅 Pen Pen 对着主人回应道，那语气和姿态让真嗣确信它看起来像是在冒冷汗。

"How could you ever think we'd be so irresponsible…!" Asuka began her pride now allowing her to properly respond to Misato's barbs as the two of them began a heated, though not entirely serious argument across the kitchen table while Shinji opted to remain quiet, the attention of his mind on the feeling Asuka's gesticulations were giving to his lap and how bouncy the other woman's "assets" were in her loose-fitting tank top as she responded to Asuka's movements in kind.  
"你怎么会认为我们会如此不负责任…！" 明日香开始反击，她的骄傲不允许她对美里的话无动于衷，两人在厨房桌子上展开了一场激烈但并不完全认真的争论，而真嗣选择保持沉默，他的注意力集中在明日香的手势给他的大腿带来的感觉，以及她宽松背心下随着动作而弹跳的"资本"，她同样以动作回应明日香的挑衅。

They were so loud, or distracted in Shinji's case, the three of them didn't even hear the phone when it first rang. But by the fourth ring they did.  
他们的声音太大，或者像真嗣那样被分散了注意力，以至于电话第一次响起时他们都没听到。但到了第四声，他们注意到了。

"Now who could that be?" Misato asked, her tone returned to normal, as she looked across the kitchen to the stand where the phone lay.  
"会是谁呢？" 美里问道，语气恢复了正常，她望向厨房另一头的电话架。

"Not sure." Asuka said, some trace of annoyance still lingering, as she looked at the black plastic as it ringed a fifth time.  
"不清楚。" 明日香说，语气中仍带着一丝不悦，她看着那黑色塑料电话响了第五声。

"Well, Asuka, you are the closest." Shinji said with his awkward charm and a nervous smile.  
"嗯，明日香，你离得最近。" 真嗣带着尴尬的亲切和紧张的微笑说道。

"Fine." Asuka said as she put her soup on the edge of the table, got up from Shinji's lap and went over to the phone knowing full well the _real_ reason he didn't want to stand up at that moment.  
“好吧。”明日香说着，将汤碗搁在桌边，从真嗣腿上起身，走向电话，心里清楚他此刻不愿站起来的真正原因。

"Hello?" the redhead said rather annoyed at whoever had interrupted her winning a debate with a superior officer. "Ahhh!" Asuka's voice lit up as she began speaking in German that was utterly lost on Shinji and reminded Misato that her own German was incredibly rusty.  
“喂？”红发少女语气中带着几分不悦，显然是对打断她与上级军官辩论胜利的人感到不满。“啊哈！”明日香的声音突然明亮起来，开始用真嗣完全听不懂的德语交谈，这让美里意识到自己的德语也变得相当生疏了。

Eventually, Asuka checked off all the standard things she wanted to talk about and all the societally obligated questions she had to ask the person on the other end and used a phrase that Shinji could understand.  
最终，明日香聊完了所有她想谈的标准话题，也问完了社会礼仪上必须问对方的问题，用了一个真嗣能理解的短语结束了通话。

"_Gute Nacht_!" Asuka said as she hung up the phone.  
"晚安！" 明日香说着挂断了电话。

"Wow, you were on for a long time." Shinji said from the table as Asuka turned around, thankful his self-control had reasserted itself.  
"哇，你打了很久啊。" 真嗣从桌边说道，明日香转过身来，庆幸他的自制力又回来了。

"Yeah…" Asuka began before her eyes squinted and she let out a "**HEY**!" before diving towards their fourth roommate reaching for the last piece of pumpernickel.  
"是啊……" 明日香开口道，随即眯起眼睛，大喊一声"嘿！"，然后扑向他们的第四位室友，试图抢到最后一片黑麦面包。

Her hands wrapping around the feathered culprit and turning his orange beak and beady eyes around to face her ire.  
她的双手环抱着那羽毛纷飞的罪魁祸首，将他那橙色的喙和圆溜溜的眼睛转向自己，面对她的怒火。

Asuka had the words she wanted to say to that alcoholic bag of useless feathers flowed through her mind:  
明日香脑海中流转着她想对那个酗酒的废物羽毛袋说的话：

'You thieving bird! Shinji's bread is _**MINE!**_'  
‘你这偷窃的鸟！真嗣的面包是我的！’

But she never got to say them as her roughing up the warm-water penguin against the table leg caused her half empty bowl of soup that she'd placed on that edge to fall directly on her head. It had thankfully cooled during her long conversation with her stepmother, so she was spared any burns or scalded skin and was instead left with dirtied clothes, hair, and wounded pride.  
但她还没来得及说出口，她用力蹭着桌腿的温水企鹅就导致她放在桌边的那半碗汤直接扣在了自己头上。幸好这汤在她与继母长时间的交谈中已经冷却，她没有被烫伤，只是衣服、头发都弄脏了，自尊心也受到了伤害。

It had been so surprising her fingers had even let go of Pen Pen, and the penguin, knowing luck when he saw it, scurried away to his freezer, the bread forgotten.  
这突如其来的变故让她连手指都松开了，企鹅 Pen Pen 见状，知道好运来了，便赶紧逃回冰箱，那块面包也被遗忘了。

"Are you okay Asuka?" Shinji asked.  
“你还好吗，明日香？”真嗣问道。

"No" Asuka spat out the word with venom as she looked at the mess that had been made of her outfit before stripping off the soup spoiled clothes with a rage-filled scream befitting of her nickname. "What!?" Asuka asked both of them with her trademarked fire as they looked dumbfounded at her standing there in her red bra and panties.  
"不！" 明日香带着毒意吐出这个词，看着自己被弄得一团糟的衣服，愤怒地尖叫着脱下被汤弄脏的衣物，那尖叫声与她的绰号相得益彰。"什么！？" 明日香带着她标志性的怒火向他们两人问道，他们看着她站在那里，只穿着红色胸罩和内裤，一脸茫然。

"Nothing!" Shinji and Misato said in unison.  
"没什么！" 真嗣和美里异口同声地说道。

"Arrgghh, I need a shower!" Asuka said as she stomped off toward the bathroom and Shinji did what was in his nature and sighed before cleaning up. Just as he had finished getting the floor another set of ringing filled the apartment, this time from Misato's phone.  
"啊啊啊，我需要洗个澡！" 明日香说着，跺着脚朝浴室走去，而真嗣则按照他的本性叹了口气，开始清理。他刚把地板弄干净，公寓里又响起了铃声，这次是美里的手机。

"Katsuragi here." She said as she answered it before her mood turned sour at the news she heard.  
"这里是葛城。" 她接起电话，听到消息后心情立刻变糟。

"What do you mean they need _my_ signature?!" She began clearly annoyed before hearing something that made her furious. "Before _and_ after the installation!? Is this some kind of joke?!" Before she resigned herself to the mandatory unpaid overtime that defined her job: "Fine."  
"他们需要我的签名是什么意思？！" 她明显不悦地开始说道，听到某事让她怒不可遏。"安装前后都需要？！这是在开玩笑吗？！" 最终，她无奈地接受了这份工作所定义的无偿加班："好吧。"

"Is everything okay Misato?" Shinji asked despite clearly knowing it wasn't.  
"一切都好吗，美里？" 真嗣问道，尽管他清楚并非如此。

"Some new spare parts just came from Germany, and they apparently need me there to supervise them since they need someone with enough authority to sign off on them but not high up enough to tell 'em to shove it!" Misato said, venting at her male ward as she got her keys and put on her shoes and jacket at the door before turning back to look at Shinji. "I don't know when I'll be back. Goodbye Shinji."  
"刚从德国来了一些新零件，显然他们需要我在那里监督，因为需要一个有足够权威签字但又不够高层到可以让他们滚蛋的人！" 美里一边向她的男性监护对象发泄，一边在门口拿钥匙、穿鞋和外套，然后回头看向真嗣。"我不知道什么时候回来。再见，真嗣。"

"Bye Misato." Shinji said as he saw the door hiss shut, before looking back into the apartment.  
"再见，美里。" 真嗣看着门嘶嘶地关上，然后回头望向公寓。

'It feels so lonely, so gloomy now.' The cobalt-eyed boy thought.  
'感觉好孤单，好阴沉。' 蓝眼睛的男孩心想。

In the apartment's newfound silence his ears picked up on the tell-tale flow and pattering of the shower still running. An idea turned over in his mind, his hand clenched and unclenched a time or two before a decision was made and his feet began carrying him forward.  
在公寓新得的静谧中，他的耳朵捕捉到了淋浴间仍在流淌的水声和轻拍声。一个念头在他脑海中翻转，他的手紧握又松开了一两次，终于下定决心，脚步开始带着他向前走去。

Asuka Langley Sohryu rinsed the last of the shampoo and soup out of her hair, making a multi-colored swirl of bubbles and bits as the water carried it down the drain and out of sight but not out of mind for the redhead. She stood under the flow of steaming water as she replayed the events in her mind, going over every little detail. Her pride wasn't her life anymore, but still, she didn't like feeling embarrassed, feeling ashamed.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷冲洗掉最后一丝洗发水和肥皂泡沫，彩色泡沫和碎屑随着水流被冲入下水道，消失在视线之外，却未曾从红发少女的心中抹去。她站在滚烫的水流下，反复回想着发生的一切，细细咀嚼每一个细节。她的骄傲不再是生活的全部，但即便如此，她也不喜欢感到尴尬，感到羞愧。

"I made a fool of myself."  
“我真是出尽了洋相。”

"No, you didn't." A voice she knew told her. She wasn't so much surprised to hear it as much as she was surprised that it came from inside the shower. So absorbed she had been in her own self-pity she hadn't heard Shinji open the bathroom door…or the shower door…after he fumbled and damn near tripped trying to take his clothes off, uncoordinated baka that he is. Damn it Asuka you're supposed to be an elite pilot.  
"不，你没有。"一个她熟悉的声音告诉她。她并不太惊讶听到这个声音，而是惊讶它来自淋浴间内部。她沉浸在自己的自怜中，以至于没听到真嗣打开浴室门……或是淋浴间的门……在他笨手笨脚地试图脱掉衣服时，差点摔倒，真是笨拙的笨蛋。该死，明日香，你本该是个精英驾驶员。

"Baka" Asuka said before she turned around to look at her nude lover in the condensation-covered glass sanctuary that was the apartment's shower. "What if Misato sees us like this?"  
"笨蛋" 明日香说，然后转身看向她那赤裸的恋人在被水汽覆盖的玻璃圣所——公寓的淋浴间里。"要是美里看到我们这样怎么办？"

"She just left." Shinji said as he tilted his head toward the door to the outside world.  
"她刚走。" 真嗣说着，把头偏向通往外界的门。

"NERV called?" Asuka surmised as she turned around to look at some very interesting droplets form on the wall's tiles.  
"NERV 叫我们了？" 明日香转过身来，目光被墙砖上形成的有趣水珠吸引。

"Yep." Shinji responded, before spending a moment looking at Asuka's backside. His mind, however, was not focused on that sight, but on the creeping helplessness in his heart that he might not be able to help Asuka, that he'd made a rash, ill-advised decision. So, his lips formed the words: "Do you want me to go?" What seemed like a long silence, broken only by the sound of the pattering shower held between them for what seemed like eternity but in reality, was less than thirty seconds.  
"嗯。" 真嗣回应道，随后花了一会儿时间盯着明日香的背影。然而，他的心思并未集中在那景象上，而是沉浸在内心深处逐渐蔓延的无助感中，担心自己可能无法帮助明日香，担心自己做出了一个鲁莽且不明智的决定。于是，他的嘴唇动了动，吐出几个字："你想让我离开吗？" 一段看似漫长的沉默，只被淋浴间滴水的声音打破，这看似永恒的瞬间，实际上不过三十秒。

"I don't mind being in the same water as you baka." Asuka said as she turned around and pressed her lithe and glistening body against his as her smile returned to her face, happy that he was there, that there was someone who cared. Shinji reciprocated and wrapped his arms around her back to bring her in closer as they stood under the showerhead. He could feel her erect nipples against him, hard despite the temperature of the water, surrounded by the wet fleshy mounds of her chest as her legs sought to intertwine with his own as her cerulean blues locked with his cobalt orbs.  
"我不介意和你共用这些水，笨蛋。" 明日香说着转过身来，将她那纤细而闪亮的身体紧贴在他身上，脸上重新绽放出笑容，庆幸他在这里，有人关心。真嗣也回应着，双臂环抱她的背部，将她拉得更近，两人站在花洒下。他能感受到她挺立的乳头抵着自己，尽管水温宜人，却依然坚硬，被她湿润的胸脯环绕，她的双腿试图与他的交缠，她那蔚蓝的眼睛与他的深蓝眸子紧紧相锁。

Their locked eyes drew closer to each other as the desires of their lips took over until contact was made and electricity shot through the both of them, carrying with it passion and understanding. As the kiss ended Asuka rested her head on Shinji's shoulder, her long wet locks clinging to his skin as they draped over their intermingled bodies.  
他们的目光紧紧相锁，随着唇间的渴望逐渐占据上风，直到触碰发生，电流般的感觉贯穿两人，携带着激情与理解。亲吻结束后，明日香将头靠在真嗣的肩上，她那湿漉漉的长发紧贴着他的肌肤，垂落在他们交缠的身体上。

"I wish we could do this all the time." Asuka said as her earlier self-doubt and shame melted away from Shinji's touch, while Shinji felt his own worries crash against the fortitude that came from knowing he was worthy of love, that others would be kind if he reached out.  
“我希望我们能一直这样。”明日香说道，她之前的自我怀疑和羞愧在真嗣的触碰下消融，而真嗣则感到自己的忧虑在知道自己值得被爱的坚定信念前崩溃，意识到只要他伸出手，他人便会给予善意。

"Maybe we need our own place." Shinji half-seriously suggested.  
“也许我们需要一个自己的地方。”真嗣半开玩笑地提议道。

"They'd never allow that." Asuka responded. She knew NERV would never let their two premier pilots live under the same roof unsupervised. Maybe separately and alone, but for now living with Misato was the only way to be in the same place together.  
"他们绝不会允许那样。" 明日香回应道。她知道 NERV 绝不会让他们的两位顶尖驾驶员在没有监督的情况下同住一个屋檐下。或许分开独居可以，但目前与美里同住是唯一能让他们共处一地的方式。

"Yeah" Shinji said resignedly before changing the topic: "So what'd you talk about?" Shinji asked after a moment or two of silence as their bodies rocked lightly back and forth under the soothing water.  
"是啊" 真嗣无奈地说，随后转换了话题："那你们聊了些什么？" 真嗣在片刻的沉默后问道，他们的身体在舒缓的水流中轻轻摇晃。

"Just a routine communication you know." Asuka answered dispassionately.  
"只是例行通讯，你知道的。" 明日香淡然回答。

"Really?" Shinji asked, by his tone it was clear he wasn't buying her nonchalant act. This caused Asuka to pause their rocking motions as her mind worked and her mouth opened:  
"真的吗？" 真嗣问道，从他的语气可以明显看出他并不相信她的若无其事。这让明日香暂停了摇摆的动作，她的思绪在运转，嘴巴张开：

"It's not like I hate them. I mean, they were never bad, but I just…" Asuka trailed off as an image of a monkey doll with its stuffing torn out and spewing onto the ground flashed before her eyes and the words of her younger self echoed in her ears.  
"我并不是讨厌它们。我是说，它们从来都不坏，但我只是……" 明日香话音未落，眼前闪过一只填充物被撕出、散落一地的猴子玩偶的画面，耳边回响着年幼时的自己的话语。

"Hey, don't be like that." Shinji said as he lifted up her chin so he could look into her eyes, his face bearing a smile, genuine and warming, that made her reciprocate before turning her face back toward the shower bottom.  
"嘿，别这样。" 真嗣说着抬起她的下巴，以便能直视她的眼睛，他的脸上带着真诚温暖的微笑，让她不由自主地回应，然后将脸转向淋浴间的底部。

"I know…I really just talk to them like I'm reading from a script, but I don't really _know_ them, I don't know if I _want_ to know them." Asuka said as she reflected on what everyone who's had family has felt.  
“我知道……我其实只是像照着剧本跟他们说话，但我并不真正了解他们，我不知道我是否想了解他们。”明日香在反思那些有家庭的人都会有的感受时说道。

'Does that make me a disgusting person?' Asuka thought, as her mind unbiddenly replayed a memory of her in a hospital looking at the deranged figure that was her mother through observation glass while her ears heard muted grunts and knocks from the next room from her father and the woman who would become her stepmother.  
“这让我变得很恶心吗？”明日香想着，脑海中不由自主地回放起自己在医院透过观察玻璃看着她那精神错乱的母亲的记忆，同时耳边传来隔壁房间父亲和即将成为她继母的女人的低沉呻吟和敲击声。

Asuka's lips snarled in revulsion as she understood what those were now that she was older, her mind regretting her earlier words that her family wasn't awful. They may not have been cruel, they may have tried to be loving, but that didn't mean they weren't selfish. Not that she made that decision hard for them, being hell-bent on being grown-up and independent, to rely on and need no one.  
明日香厌恶地撇了撇嘴，随着年龄的增长，她明白了那些声音的含义，心中后悔自己早先说家人并不糟糕的话。他们或许不残忍，或许曾试图表达爱意，但这并不意味着他们不自私。她自己也没有让这个决定变得困难，一心想要长大和独立，不依赖也不需要任何人。

"I know that feeling." Shinji said, a trace of bitterness in his voice as his mind replayed again the image of a crying child in a train station. "But at least you have family that calls you."  
"我懂那种感觉。" 真嗣说道，声音中带着一丝苦涩，脑海中再次浮现出火车站哭泣的孩子的画面。"但至少你还有家人会叫你。"

"Hah!" Asuka let out sarcastically before responding with a question: "Think we'll turn out any different?" Asuka said as she brought her face back up to look into Shinji's blues. Her eyes had that pleading, wondering, in them asking if that's how all people became when they got older, that children end up making the same mistakes in an endless cycle.  
"哈！" 明日香讽刺地哼了一声，然后反问道："你觉得我们会变得不一样吗？" 明日香抬起头，直视着真嗣的蓝眼睛。她的眼中带着恳求和疑惑，想知道这是否是所有人长大后的样子，孩子们是否会在无尽的循环中重复同样的错误。

"Asuka" Shinji began, his jaw set, and face determined "You're you, and I'm me." Shinji said as he brought his hands up to her shoulders and squeezed them as he looked into her eyes. Asuka smiled, closed her eyes, and nodded as one of her hands went up to embrace her lover's.  
"明日香" 真嗣开口道，下颌紧绷，神情坚定 "你是你，我是我。" 真嗣说着，双手搭在她的肩上，紧紧握住，目光直视她的眼睛。明日香微笑着，闭上眼睛，点了点头，一只手伸上去拥抱她的爱人。

The two of them brought their bodies together in a tight hug, Asuka kissing Shinji on the cheek as both let their insecurities be melted away in the embrace of the other.  
两人紧紧相拥，明日香在真嗣的脸颊上轻轻一吻，彼此的不安在对方的怀抱中渐渐消融。

They stayed like that for a long moment, letting the water wash away their worries before Shinji absently got an idea.  
他们就这样静静地待了好一会儿，任由水流冲刷掉心中的忧虑，直到真嗣不经意间灵光一闪。

"You're still so tense Asuka." Shinji said as he broke the tightness of the embrace though kept his hands on her body, "Your muscles I mean." He continued as his hands went to her shoulders, giving them a squeeze before he picked up a bottle of lavender shower gel. Depositing the blue liquid in his hands before lathering it, his own hands quickly becoming covered in small, blue-tinted bubbles.  
“你还是这么紧绷，明日香。”真嗣说着，虽然松开了紧抱，但双手仍停留在她的身体上，“我是说你的肌肉。”他继续说着，双手移到她的肩膀，轻轻捏了捏，然后拿起一瓶薰衣草沐浴露。将蓝色液体倒在手上，搓出泡沫，他的双手很快就被染成蓝色的小泡泡覆盖。

Asuka laughed at the sight but still obligingly turned around and moved her wet hair around, so it draped down her front and her back were clear for Shinji's fingers.  
看到这一幕，明日香笑了，但还是顺从地转过身，甩动她湿漉漉的头发，让它垂落在胸前，而她的背部则清晰地展现在真嗣的指尖下。

Her lover began working his magic. His fingers rubbing the makeshift massage balm on her shoulders. The bright blue bubbles contrasting beautifully with the dark auburn her hair became when it was wet. Shinji wasn't an expert, but he knew enough to make circles with his thumbs on her stressed muscles while avoiding pressing too hard on her bones.  
她的爱人开始施展他的魔法。他的手指在她肩上涂抹着临时制作的按摩膏。明亮的蓝色泡沫与她湿发后深暗的赤褐色形成美丽的对比。真嗣虽非专家，但他知道用拇指在她紧绷的肌肉上画圈，同时避免用力按压她的骨骼。

He worked his way across her shoulders, before heading down her spine and finding a knot in Asuka's lower back that had been giving her a hard time for nigh on a week. She stepped forward into the rushing water, the tensed stress being washed away along with the blue bubbles.  
他从她的肩膀一路向下，沿着脊椎摸索，找到了明日香下背部的一个结，这个结已经困扰她将近一周了。她向前迈步，踏入急流中，紧张的压力随着蓝色泡沫一起被冲走。

"_Danke Leibling."_ Asuka began, reverting to her native language to keep the surprise for as long as possible, _"Jetzt ist es zeit für ihre_ _**Belohnung**__."_  
"谢谢亲爱的。" 明日香开始说道，切换回她的母语以尽可能长时间地保持惊喜，"现在是时候领取你的奖励了。"

'Reward?' Shinji's mind thought as he managed to translate one of the German words, only knowing it because of what Asuka usually did when she used it.  
'奖励？' 真嗣的脑海中闪过这个德语单词的翻译，仅凭明日香通常使用它时的行为才勉强认得。

Sure enough, Shinji's intuition was correct and Asuka spun him around, so his back was under the shower's stream and Asuka knelt down so her face was directly in front of his stiffening member as Shinji's hormones began to take over. He felt the sucking wetness he knew to be her mouth on his cock, drawing in every red blood cell his body could spare. Soon after four or five more bobs of Asuka's head Shinji had become rock hard.  
果然，真嗣的直觉是正确的，明日香将他转过身来，让他的背部处于淋浴的水流之下，而她则跪下，脸直接对准他逐渐勃起的部位。随着真嗣的荷尔蒙开始发挥作用，他感受到了那种熟悉的、被她口腔吸吮的湿润感，她的嘴紧紧包裹着他的阴茎，吸取着他身体所能提供的每一滴血液。不久之后，随着明日香头部又上下摆动了四五次，真嗣已经完全硬挺起来。

Asuka now picked up the pace as her right hand went around to Shinji's backside to grab a handful of his cute ass while her left softly fondled the still lose and wrinkly skin that held Shinji's balls.  
明日香加快了速度，右手绕到真嗣的臀部，抓了一把他的可爱屁股，而左手则轻轻抚摸着依然松弛有皱的真嗣的阴囊。

His mouth let out a moan of its own to add to the orchestra of the showerhead and slurping sounds as Asuka's mouth worked. Waves of pleasure and electricity flowed through Shinji's body, and he felt goosebumps spring up on his skin as his eyelids seemed to close on their own as his body was stimulated further by Asuka's tongue.  
他的口中也发出了一声呻吟，加入了花洒和吮吸声的交响乐。一波波的快感和电流流过真嗣的身体，他感到鸡皮疙瘩在皮肤上冒起，眼睑似乎自行闭合，身体因明日香的舌头而进一步受到刺激。

Wanting to give Shinji a proper gift for his cooking and massage Asuka opened up her lips wider and bracing both her hands on his ass proceeded to drive herself down his length, until the tip of her tongue could touch the wrinkles of his hairless sack.  
为了给真嗣的烹饪和按摩送上一份合适的礼物，明日香张大了嘴唇，双手撑在他的臀部，开始沿着他的长度向下推进，直到她的舌尖能够触及他无毛的囊袋的皱褶。

As Asuka was gagging on his cock as the entirety of his shaft was inside her mouth and throat, the convulsing muscles and folds massaging his member her hands absently moved from his backside and felt his balls tighten against his body. Shinji gritted his teeth in an effort to hold back the torrent his burning balls wanted to unleash at that moment, but his mind and its primal lusts yearned for as much pleasure as possible.  
当明日香因他的阴茎完全深入口腔和喉咙而窒息时，她喉咙和口腔的肌肉不由自主地收缩，按摩着他的肉棒，她的手不经意间从他的臀部移开，感觉到他的睾丸紧贴着身体收紧。真嗣咬紧牙关，努力抑制住那股由灼热睾丸想要释放的汹涌欲望，但他的内心及其原始的欲望却渴望尽可能多地享受快感。

After a few more choking-like sounds from Asuka, she finally released her hold. His cock entirely exiting from her mouth as it dragged in lungsful of air in gasping breaths before returning her mouth to Shinji's member and the more traditional bobs of a blowjob.  
在明日香发出几声类似窒息的声音后，她终于松开了口。他的阴茎完全从她口中退出，她急促地深吸了几口气，然后再次将嘴凑向真嗣的肉棒，开始了更为传统的口交动作。

But Shinji was already too close to take much more stimulation.  
但真嗣已经太过接近高潮，无法承受更多的刺激。

"Asuka, I'm going to…" Shinji verbalized with difficulty as Asuka's actions made speaking tough.  
“明日香，我……” 真嗣艰难地开口，明日香的动作让说话变得困难。

In response to Shinji's warning Asuka brought her mouth back so only the tip remained inside before opening her lips up as wide as they would go. A faint 'Awwing' sound could be heard emanating from her open mouth as her right hand furiously pumped up and down Shinji's shaft while her left hand continued to massage the balls of his taut and receded sack. The sight and feeling were too much for Shinji and Asuka felt his cock twitch in her hand as his load shot across her exposed tongue, leaving visible streaks of the white substance and a bitter, though not unpleasant taste, in her mouth. She kept her lips open for a moment longer, her eyes locked on her lover's as he absorbed the sight, before she let out a satisfied moan, extricated Shinji's cock from her mouth after giving it a last suck, and swallowing down the cum he had deposited on her tongue.  
听到真嗣的警告，明日香将嘴退开，只留下舌尖在内，然后尽可能地张大双唇。她张开的嘴里隐约传来一声轻微的‘啊’声，右手疯狂地上下抽动着真嗣的阴茎，而左手则继续按摩着他紧绷且收缩的阴囊。这一幕和感觉对真嗣来说太过强烈，明日香感觉到他的阴茎在她手中抽搐，他的精液喷射在她暴露的舌头上，留下了可见的白色痕迹，并在她口中留下了一种苦涩但不令人讨厌的味道。她保持嘴唇张开片刻，眼睛紧盯着她的爱人，让他吸收这一景象，然后发出满意的呻吟，在最后一次吮吸后将真嗣的阴茎从嘴里抽出，并吞下了他留在她舌头上的精液。

Asuka then stood up and put her face directly in the stream of hot water to wash off any stray strands or droplets that may have found their way onto her face and hair.  
随后，明日香站起身，将脸直接放在热水流中，冲洗掉可能溅到她脸上和头发上的任何散落丝线或水滴。

While her eyes were closed, she was absently aware of a hard mass rubbing itself up and down her ample ass as she felt a hand grab her left breast, twisting the nipple playfully while a kiss to her neck made her back shiver in pleasure.  
尽管她闭着眼睛，却能隐约感觉到一个坚硬的物体在她丰满的臀部上来回摩擦，同时一只手抓住了她的左乳，俏皮地扭动着乳头，而颈间的一吻让她背脊因愉悦而颤抖。

'He's still hard.' Asuka's mind told her what her body already knew. '_Wunderbar_.'  
'他依然坚挺。' 明日香的心告诉她，她的身体早已知晓。'太棒了。'

The German redhead turned around and before her eyes could open her lips felt the warm wetness of Shinji's mouth as it pressed on them, his tongue forcing them open as Shinji's strong arms pressed her back up against the wet shower tiles. His leg, forcing her own apart while his right hand lifted up her left leg so his cock could have easier access to her most private place.  
这位德国红发少女转过身来，在她睁开眼睛之前，她的双唇就感受到了新治口中温暖的湿润，他的舌头迫使她的嘴唇分开，新治强壮的手臂将她紧紧压在湿漉漉的淋浴瓷砖上。他的腿迫使她分开自己的双腿，同时右手抬起她的左腿，以便他的阴茎能更容易进入她最私密的地方。

As she felt his still rock-hard member pressing against the pink petals of her labia, she broke the kiss and put her lips to his ear and whispered:  
当她感觉到他依旧坚硬的部位紧贴着自己粉嫩的阴唇时，她结束了亲吻，将唇凑到他的耳边，低语道：

"You better enjoy this Shinji." Asuka began, before saying the words every male dreads, "It's almost time."  
“你最好享受这一刻，真嗣。”明日香开口道，随即说出了每个男性都害怕听到的话，“差不多到时候了。”

Now like all lovers passionately enthralled with the other they had in the past tried having sex when Asuka was on her period. The result was…less than ideal. Dark, staining blood had gotten everywhere and ruined so many of the apartment's towels that Shinji had worried that even the apotheosis of mess and disorder that was Misato Katsuragi would notice. Not to mention the sex wasn't even all that good, there being too much, uh, "liquid" for either Shinji or Asuka to derive much pleasure. There needs to be the right balance between lubrication and pressure for sex to be enjoyable. Too little wetness and the woman chafes and is hurt. Too much, and the man doesn't feel he's actually inside anything.  
就像所有热恋中的情侣一样，他们过去也曾尝试在明日香经期时做爱。结果……并不理想。深色的血迹弄脏了所有东西，公寓里的毛巾几乎全被毁了，真嗣担心就连邋遢至极的葛城美里都会注意到。更别提那次性爱体验并不好，过多的“液体”让真嗣和明日香都难以获得快感。性爱需要恰到好处的润滑与压力平衡才能愉悦。润滑不足，女性会擦伤并感到疼痛；润滑过多，男性则感觉不到实质的进入。

Both had agreed to never repeat that experience again. Asuka could tell she was close though, tomorrow, maybe the day after and she would feel the full blessings that womanhood brought.  
两人都同意再也不重复那次经历。明日，或许后天，明日香就能感受到女性身份带来的全部祝福。

She felt Shinji nod slightly as she rested her head on his shoulder while he slowly pushed his member past her entrance, her own juices and the water from the shower making this an easy task and soon the length of his shaft resided within her pussy as Shinji felt Asuka shake in his arms at the feeling of fullness.  
她感觉到真嗣微微点头，当她将头靠在他的肩上时，他缓缓地将他的成员推过她的入口，她自己的体液和淋浴的水使得这一任务变得轻松，很快他的阴茎长度就完全进入了她的阴道，真嗣感觉到明日香在他怀里因那种充实感而颤抖。

Asuka brought her head from his shoulder and up to Shinji's face, their eyes boring into each other, their souls and hearts as intertwined as their bodies were. Both pairs of lips rushed to meet the other in a show of that bond.  
明日香将头从他的肩膀上抬起，直视着真嗣的脸，他们的眼神深深地交织在一起，灵魂和心灵如同他们的身体一样紧密相连。两对嘴唇急切地相迎，展现了那份深厚的羁绊。

Their tongues not battling for dominance, but instead dancing with the other as Shinji began to slowly move inside her, taking a bit more of his length out of her with each slow deliberate thrust until he was ramming nearly his entire shaft into her with each stroke. Causing her to break the kiss and unleash a moan before her teeth found her lip.  
他们的舌头并未争斗主宰，而是与对方共舞，随着真嗣开始在她体内缓缓移动，每一次缓慢而刻意的推进都将更多他的长度抽出，直到每次冲击几乎将整根阴茎深深插入她体内。这让她中断亲吻，发出一声呻吟，随后牙齿轻咬住自己的唇。

Shinji kept up his rhythm though as he felt the softness of her insides press against him and his own mouth went to her neck, covering it in kisses and her body in goosebumps, eliciting another audible moan from Asuka before she found Shinji's shoulder to bite into. Her teeth leaving red marks on his skin, but neither were worried about that now.  
尽管如此，真嗣保持着节奏，感受着她柔软内壁的压迫，同时他的唇移向她的脖颈，留下一串吻痕，激起她一身鸡皮疙瘩，引得明日香再次发出可闻的呻吟，随后她找到真嗣的肩膀咬了上去。她的牙齿在他的皮肤上留下红色印记，但此刻两人都未在意这些。

The piercing sensation that Asuka's teeth sent through Shinji caused his thrusts into her to become more forceful, her glistening breasts jiggling between them in response. The brown nipples occasionally swiping across Shinji's chest as they went back and forth. Her back was rubbing against the shower's wall smooth tiles, the rough grout between leaving small scratches on her back as her whole body vibrated as the smacks of their bodies connecting sounded in the glass box.  
明日香牙齿带来的刺痛感让真嗣在她体内的冲击变得更加有力，她那闪耀着光泽的乳房在他们之间颤动。棕色的乳头不时划过真嗣的胸膛，来回摆动。她的背部摩擦着淋浴间光滑的瓷砖，粗糙的填缝剂在她的背上留下细小的划痕，随着他们身体碰撞的声响在玻璃间回荡，她的整个身体都在颤抖。

Her arms, seemingly wanting to make the pair of lovers more one than they already were, tightened around his back just as her walls did around his shaft. She could feel her crescendo building in her belly as the pleasure pooled there like water behind a dam, just waiting to burst.  
她的双臂，仿佛渴望让这对恋人更加亲密无间，紧紧环抱在他的背上，正如她的体内紧紧包裹着他的坚挺。她能感觉到高潮在腹中蓄势待发，如同水坝后的水积聚着，只待一触即发。

Shinji took his hand from where it was braced against the wall to Asuka's chin, bringing it up so that his lustful lips could connect with her own. Their mouths filled with the other's involuntary moans and whimpers as their bodies became flooded with hormones and their conscious mind became foggy and dazed, focused only on the one before them.  
真嗣将原本撑在墙上的手移向明日香的下巴，抬起她的脸，让自己的渴望之唇与她的相接。两人的口中充满了对方不由自主的呻吟与低语，随着体内荷尔蒙的涌动，他们的意识变得模糊而恍惚，只专注于眼前的彼此。

The pressure welling up inside finally burst within Asuka as she reached her peak. Her lips breaking from Shinji's as she let out a loud croaking moan, she was sure their neighbors would have heard had they existed as her insides clenched around Shinji's member.  
积聚在明日香体内的压力终于在她达到顶峰时爆发。她的唇从真嗣的唇上分开，发出一声响亮的沙哑呻吟，她确信如果他们有邻居的话，一定会被这声音惊动，她的体内紧紧夹住了真嗣的坚挺。

The sensation of her walls being as tight as they were and seemingly trying to draw his cock in deeper into her was too much for Shinji's self-control and his aching balls, burning for release shot stream after stream of his seed into Asuka's waiting pussy. A soft smile formed on her face and her eyes closed as she reveled in the feeling of his hot cum impacting her fleshy walls as they spasmed in an attempt to milk as much as possible from the twitching cock between them.  
她的内壁紧致得仿佛要将他的肉棒更深地吸入体内，这种感觉让真嗣的自控力彻底崩溃，他那渴望释放的胀痛睾丸，一股接一股地将精液射入明日香等待着的蜜穴中。她脸上浮现出温柔的微笑，双眼闭合，沉浸在他滚烫的精液冲击她肉壁的快感中，她的肉壁痉挛着试图从那颤抖的肉棒中榨取更多。

After the last droplets had escaped Shinji's balls he withdrew his shaft from her, causing the redhead to shudder as an aftershock of their ecstasy shot through her, her lips covered by her lover's and their arms wrapped around the other as they stepped away from the wall and under the running showerhead.  
在最后一滴精液从真嗣的睾丸中流出后，他抽出了自己的肉棒，让红发女孩因余韵的冲击而颤抖，她的唇被爱人覆盖，双臂环绕着对方，他们离开墙壁，站在喷洒的淋浴头下。

"Thank you baka." Asuka said as she rubbed her hand up and down his back, while she planted a peck on his lips after their bodies had come down from their recent high. "You know you've got to use lefty and righty for the next week." Asuka added to her lover as she stuck out her tongue.  
“谢谢你，笨蛋。”明日香一边说，一边用手上下抚摸他的背，待身体从刚才的高潮中平复后，她在他的唇上轻轻一吻。“你知道接下来一周得用左手和右手了。”明日香向她的爱人补充道，同时伸出舌头。

"You can't help?" Shinji said teasingly as his hands lowered themselves from her waist to her ass, grabbing a handful of each wet cheek.  
"你帮不上忙吗？" 真嗣打趣地说道，双手从她的腰间滑落到她的臀部，抓住了她湿漉漉的双颊。

"If you're a good baka, maybe." Asuka answered, a smile on her face as their lips met again, this time for a longer, deeper kiss…at least until the chill of cold water impacted both their bodies and they scrambled out of the shower as fast as their young legs would take them. Curses and teases resounding as the two pilots exited the bathroom and went to the couch, content to let the TV numb their minds until sleep took them.  
"如果你是个乖笨蛋，或许可以。" 明日香回答，脸上带着微笑，他们的唇再次相触，这次是一个更长、更深的吻……至少直到冰冷的水击中他们的身体，他们才迅速地从淋浴间冲出来，年轻的腿尽可能快地带着他们逃离。咒骂和戏谑声中，两位驾驶员离开了浴室，走到沙发上，心满意足地让电视麻木他们的思维，直到睡眠降临。

**NERV HQ: The next day  
NERV 总部：第二天**

Asuka Langley Sohryu reflected on the day's events as she waited for what seemed like the slowest elevator in all of NERV. She had had to visit the women's bathroom after the pilots' scheduled synch test, instead of immediately returning to the Katsuragi Apartment, since, while her monthly visit from biology seemed less extreme now that she was on the pill, it hadn't vanished completely. It even maintained its usual cycle, which seemed like a small blessing at least.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷在等待着 NERV 里似乎最慢的电梯时，回想着今天发生的事情。她不得不在同步率测试后去了一趟女洗手间，而不是直接返回葛城公寓，因为尽管她现在服用避孕药后生理期的反应有所减轻，但并没有完全消失。它甚至保持着一贯的周期，这至少算是个小小的安慰。

She and Shinji had done well during the day's test, scoring within their usual synchronization range. Though she had heard Dr. Akagi lament that both were off their battlefield highs with Misato pointing out that that's probably normal given the difference in body chemistry and mental state between training and real combat, which the faux-blonde begrudgingly admitted.  
她和真嗣在今天的测试中表现不错，同步率维持在平时的范围内。虽然她听到赤木博士抱怨说两人都没有达到战场上那种高同步率，美里指出这可能是因为训练和实战在身体化学反应和心理状态上的差异，这位金发假面女郎不情愿地承认了这一点。

Finally, the elevator pinged, breaking the German redhead out of her reverie as the metal doors slid open.  
终于，电梯发出“叮”的一声，将这位德国红发少女从沉思中唤醒，金属门缓缓滑开。

Asuka began to walk forward before her feet momentarily stopped as her brain registered who was in the elevator before regaining her composure. Giving a nod to the sole occupant that wasn't returned and walking into and standing in the rear of the lift as the doors closed after she pressed the button for her destination.  
明日香开始向前走去，但她的脚步突然停顿了一下，因为她的脑海中闪现出电梯里的人是谁，随后她恢复了镇定。她向唯一的乘客点了点头，但对方并未回应，然后她走进电梯，站在后方，按下目的地的按钮后，电梯门缓缓关闭。

The awkward silence, broken only by the sounds emanating from the elevator's mechanisms, dragged on for what seemed like forever before Asuka got up the resolve to speak:  
尴尬的沉默被电梯机械运作的声音打破，这种沉默似乎持续了很久，直到明日香鼓起勇气开口：

"So, how's the new place?"  
“那么，新地方怎么样？”

"Acceptable, there are no problems." Rei Ayanami responded taciturnly, giving Asuka little to work with in her seemingly misguided attempt at small talk, though thankfully her destination was only three levels away.  
"可以，没问题。" 绫波零简短地回应，让明日香在她那看似不合时宜的闲聊尝试中几乎无从下手，不过幸运的是，她的目的地只差三层了。

"Well see you around Wondergirl." Asuka said as she got off on her stop and the metal doors closed between the two pilots.  
"好吧，回头见，奇迹女孩。" 明日香在她那一站下了电梯，金属门在两位驾驶员之间缓缓关闭。

Rei meanwhile continued her ride. Until she noticed the elevator panel, and a blinking red light there. She tried to look away, but her eyes kept being drawn toward the reminder. Until, with the searing red flashing before her mind's eye as she saw her hands breaking into the panel, ripping out the offending light. The glass bulb still stubbornly blinking its hateful color as her teeth gritted and bloody fingers tore out the last wires before throwing it to the floor and crushing it beneath her shoe. And as quickly as the vision came it left leaving Rei to ask her spotless hands:  
与此同时，绫波继续她的行程。直到她注意到电梯面板上，一个闪烁的红灯。她试图移开视线，但目光总是被那个提醒所吸引。直到，随着眼前刺目的红色闪烁，她看到自己的双手撕开面板，扯出那个惹眼的红灯。玻璃灯泡依旧顽固地闪烁着它那可憎的颜色，她的牙齿紧咬，血淋淋的手指扯断了最后的电线，然后将它扔到地上，用鞋跟碾碎。这个幻象来得快去得也快，留下绫波看着她那双干净的手，心中疑惑：

"What's wrong with me?" "我这是怎么了？"

**The Eva Cages: After Arael's Detection  
《EVA 拘束笼：在亚拉尔探测之后》**

"The Angel is maintaining a constant distance outside of our defense envelope. Rei in Unit-00 is still the designated vanguard, so she'll take up position with the positron rifle while Shinji and Asuka remain on standby with their Units in cryostasis!"  
"使徒正保持在我们防御圈外的恒定距离。零在零号机中仍是先锋，她将持阳电子步枪就位，而真嗣和明日香则与他们的机体一起待命，处于冷冻状态！"

"Roger!" The three pilots said in unison as they sat in their respective entry plugs.  
“罗杰！”三位驾驶员齐声喊道，各自坐在他们的插入栓中。

'Ayanami is going out alone again.' Shinji thought melancholically as he sighed and sat back in the entry plug, resigned to waiting and hoping. Asuka meanwhile was less accepting with her own thoughts:  
“绫波又要独自出击了。”真嗣忧郁地想着，叹了口气，坐回插入栓中，无奈地等待并祈祷。与此同时，明日香的想法则不那么接受：

'Damn it! They're just going to keep holding their best units back and send Wondergirl out every time as a sacrificial lamb.' She understood why their Evas had to be in stasis, probably better than Shinji did, but still. Asuka hit the controls of her Eva to loose some of the frustration building up inside her. 'One of these days, if this keeps up, she isn't going to come back.'  
“该死！他们就是打算一直保留最强的单位，每次都派奇迹少女出去当替死鬼。”她比真嗣更明白为什么他们的 EVA 必须处于静止状态，但仍然。明日香敲打着她的 EVA 的控制器，以释放内心积聚的挫败感。“总有一天，如果这种情况持续下去，她不会再回来了。”

Up on the surface, amidst the torrential downpour that covered Tokyo-3, Rei readied the positron rifle. She allowed the weapon time to charge up as the built-in targeting computer lowered to in front of her face. Her breaths came slow and steady as she waited for the ballistics supercomputer to align the reticules on her display.  
在东京-3 的暴雨中，Rei 准备好了阳电子步枪。她让武器有时间充电，内置的目标计算机降到了她面前。她的呼吸缓慢而稳定，等待着弹道超级计算机在她的显示屏上对准准星。

Just as the rifle finished charging and the calculations had been completed, the reticules uniting and changing color as a ping filled her ears, a light shone forth upon her, ripping apart the walls of her psyche as Rei Ayanami let out the first of many screams.  
就在步枪充电完毕，计算完成，准星合并并变色，一声提示音充满她的耳朵时，一道光照亮了她，撕裂了她心灵的壁垒，Rei Ayanami 发出了第一声尖叫。

Rei absently heard the voices of those at NERV as they speculated as to what was happening and what it meant as she struggled to keep her eyes open, her mind using every wall and ounce of willpower she had to focus.  
Rei 不经意间听到了 NERV 那些人的声音，他们猜测发生了什么以及这意味着什么，而她挣扎着保持眼睛睁开，她的心灵利用每一堵墙和每一分意志力来集中注意力。

Miraculously through an effort of sheer determination Rei managed to press the firing stud, unleashing a fully charged blast into orbit. The bolt flew true to dead center of the Angel's position…Only to scatter into more than a dozen multi-colored strands of dissipating energy as the ominous octagon of an AT field appeared.  
凭借着纯粹的决心，奇迹般地，丽设法按下了发射按钮，释放出一道完全充能的能量束射向轨道。这道光束准确无误地飞向使徒的位置……却在即将命中时，分散成十几条五彩斑斓的消散能量丝带，因为一个不祥的八角形 AT 力场出现了。

"It didn't penetrate?" Ritsuko Akagi said in incredulity as she leaned over Maya's shoulder to get a closer look at the data.  
“它没有穿透吗？”赤木律子难以置信地说道，她俯身靠在玛雅的肩膀上，以便更仔细地查看数据。

"It's too far away!" Misato said as she cursed under her breath as she looked at Rei's psychograph and the critical nature her mental state was in.  
“距离太远了！”美里一边咒骂着，一边看着丽的脑波图，她的精神状态已经处于极度危险之中。

"But that was a direct hit at full charge! We can't get any more power!" An exasperated Lieutenant Hyuga said as another scream from Unit-00's cockpit echoed in Central Dogma.  
“但那是全功率的直接命中！我们无法再增加威力了！”副官日向焦急地说道，与此同时，中央教条区再次回荡起零号机驾驶舱内的尖叫声。

"Rei! Retreat!" The voice of Commander Ikari, uncharacteristically filled with emotion, broke through the commotion of the bridge in an attempt to save the First.  
“丽！撤退！”碇司令的声音穿透了舰桥的喧嚣，异常充满情感，试图拯救初号机驾驶员。

"I can't." Rei said with what remained of her willpower before shrieking as oblivion overtook her.  
“我做不到。”丽用仅存的意志力说道，随后在黑暗吞噬中发出尖叫。

Before Rei's mind's eye there replayed every memory of pain, every moment of loneliness that rested in the neurons of her brain. This she could survive. Her entire life had been nothing but enduring the sadness and isolation of standing apart from others. What was reliving them all again?  
在丽的心灵之眼前，重现了每一个痛苦的记忆，每一个孤独时刻，这些都深藏在她的神经元中。她能挺过去。她的一生不过是忍受着悲伤和孤独，与众不同地站立着。再次重温这些又有什么呢？

That was what she thought until it came to _that_ memory. She could endure every other hardship but that was too much, and she didn't know why.  
她曾这样认为，直到那个记忆浮现。她能忍受其他所有的艰难困苦，但那个记忆太过沉重，她不知道为什么。

"Why are you showing me this?" Rei began as the recollection played in her mind. "I don't want to remember this."  
“为什么你要给我看这个？”丽开始说道，当这段回忆在她脑海中播放时。“我不想记起这个。”

_**You're lying. 你在撒谎。**_

_It was the evening of the 14__th_ _Angel Zeruel's attack. Her Eva had been far too damaged for her to fight so she remained in the Eva cages. At least until the Geofront was breached. Then, she wasn't sure why, but her legs started moving. Carrying her through the secret tunnels and passages she knew well from a lifetime spent with NERV. Perhaps her human appendages had decided to do something, even if to only bear witness. She found her way to a hill on the Geofront's edge, observing Units 01 and 02 in their desperate struggle. She was tempted, once or twice, to aid with her own AT field. But in the end the Angel died less than a hundred meters from where she stood._  
那是第 14 使徒 Zeruel 袭击的傍晚。她的 Eva 受损过于严重，无法再战，因此她留在 Eva 格纳库中。至少在 Geofront 被攻破之前。随后，她也不确定为何，双腿开始自行移动。带着她穿过她从一生在 NERV 中度过而熟知的秘密隧道和通道。或许她的肉体部分决定要做些什么，哪怕只是见证。她找到了 Geofront 边缘的一座小山，观察着 01 和 02 号机绝望的战斗。她曾一两次想用自己的 AT 力场帮忙。但最终，使徒在她站立处不到百米的地方死去。

_She'd felt a warmness in her heart when she saw pilot Ikari, that he was safe. She felt something else, akin to a bitter taste in her mouth, when she saw the flash of red rush towards him. And something entirely alien a moment later burrowing down into the pit of her stomach.  
当她看到驾驶员碇真嗣平安无事时，心中感到一阵温暖。而当她看到那抹红色向他冲去时，她感到一种类似苦涩的味道在口中蔓延。随后，一种完全陌生的感觉深深钻入她的腹中。_

'_He kissed her.'_ '他吻了她。'

"_Interesting."_ “有意思。”

_**Why didn't you tell the Commander what you saw?  
你为什么不告诉指挥官你看到的事情？**_

"It… would have hurt Ikari." Rei quietly gave her answer to the nebulous voice in her mind as her own mind replayed the question, she had asked a million times since that night 'Why her?'  
“那……会伤害到碇。”绫波静静地向她脑海中模糊的声音给出了回答，与此同时，她自己的思绪也在反复回放着那个问题，自那晚以来她已问过自己无数次——‘为什么是她？’

_**Why does that matter? 那有什么关系？**_

"I…care…about him. He is kind."  
"我……关心……他。他很善良。"

_**The doll has feelings? 这玩偶有感情吗？**_

"I am not a doll."  
"我不是玩偶。"

_**You are made like a doll though. An artificial being forced to be alive until your purpose is fulfilled.  
但你却像玩偶一样被制造出来。一个被迫活着的人工生命体，直到完成使命。**_

"And when it is, then I will be free."  
"而当那一天到来时，我便能自由。"

_**Free? Do you believe that? Do you wish for death, the sweet release that oblivion offers?  
自由？你相信这种说法吗？你渴望死亡，那遗忘所赐予的甜美解脱？**_

"I…don't know." “我……不知道。”

_**Yet you distance yourself from others as if the void had already claimed you, and then are surprised when they discard you?  
然而你却疏远他人，仿佛虚空已将你吞噬，然后又惊讶于他们将你抛弃？**_

"Get out of my mind!"  
“从我脑海里滚出去！”

_**Death will separate you from Ikari as much as SHE will. It is the ultimate state loneliness, of vanishing from the hearts of others.  
死亡会将你与碇分离，就像她一样。那是终极的孤独状态，从他人的心中消失。**_

"Stop!" “住手！”

_**Or perhaps death could separate him from the red one?  
或许死亡能将他与那位红发之人分开？**_

"**NO!"**

_**Don't they deserve it? Don't you deserve it?  
他们难道不配得到吗？你难道不配得到吗？**_

"Argghh!" “啊！”

_**That's not an answer. Is the doll broken? Can it not speak?  
那不是答案。玩偶坏了吗？它不能说话了吗？**_

"I am not a doll! _I am not a doll!_ **I am not a doll!**" Rei screamed as she tried desperately to maintain her sanity and sense of self.  
“我不是玩偶！我不是玩偶！我不是玩偶！”丽尖叫着，拼命维持自己的理智和自我认知。

**Central Dogma: The same time  
中心法则：同一时间**

"Let us go out!" Both Asuka and Shinji said synchronously as they heard Rei's continued screams over their comms.  
"我们出去吧！" 听到通讯中继续传来的绫波的尖叫声，明日香和真嗣异口同声地说道。

"Forget it! With this Angel's ability to attack a pilot's mind it's way too dangerous." Vice-Commander Fuyutsuki said as he shot down their plan, only for his boss to voice his own equally hazardous plan the next moment:  
"不行！考虑到这使徒能攻击驾驶员心智的能力，这太危险了。" 副司令冬月否决了他们的计划，紧接着他的上司提出了一个同样危险的新方案：

"Load the dummy plug into Unit-02 and have it retrieve the Lance." He said behind steepled hands as another scream from Rei punctuated the bridge.  
"把模拟插入栓装入二号机，让它去取回长枪。" 他双手合十，背后又传来绫波的一声尖叫，打断了他的话。

"Use the Lance of Longinus?! You can't do that Ikari!" Fuyutsuki nearly screamed at the seated Gendo.  
"使用朗基努斯之枪？！你不能这么做，碇！" 福音津几乎是对着坐着的源堂尖叫道。

"But I thought that if Adam and Eva were to come into contact it would cause the Third Impact. We can't take that chance!" Major Katsuragi added in a worried tone.  
"但我认为如果亚当和夏娃接触，将会引发第三次冲击。我们不能冒这个险！" 葛城美里少校忧心忡忡地补充道。

"So can merely activating Units-01 and 02. But we have no choice." NERV's leader said, with nary a crack showing in the walls he had constructed around himself before he added: "Proceed!"  
"仅仅激活 01 和 02 号机也可能导致同样的结果。但我们别无选择。" NERV 的领导人说道，他那堵自我构筑的墙没有一丝裂缝，随后他补充道："执行吧！"

Affirmations sounded across the bridge as the officers there hastened to carry out their task. Though Ritsuko found the time to mute Pilot Sohryu's mic as she unleashed a torrent of swears at being forced out of her precious Unit-02 to be replaced by a nearly untested machine. However, Gendo's plan was not to be:  
舰桥上，确认声此起彼伏，军官们急忙执行任务。尽管律子趁机关闭了驾驶员惣流的话筒，因为她被迫离开她珍爱的二号机，被一台几乎未经测试的机器取代，正破口大骂。然而，碇的计划并未如愿：

"Unit-02 is refusing the dummy plug!" Maya Ibuki said as she tried for a third time to restart the process of getting the system to cross absolute borderline. Dr. Akagi, nearly sitting in her protégé's lap, eyes glued to the monitor, did what she could to help but it was to no avail, her glasses cracking as she threw them in frustration at the offending piece of technology. Kyoko would accept no replacement.  
“二号机拒绝接受模拟插入栓！”伊吹玛亚尝试第三次重启系统，试图让系统跨越绝对界限。赤木博士几乎坐在她的徒弟的腿上，眼睛紧盯着显示器，尽力帮忙却无济于事，她气愤地将眼镜摔向那恼人的科技，镜片应声而裂。绫波不会接受任何替代品。

The screams, arguments, and klaxons sounded for nearly a full minute before Gendo, decision made, broke his silence:  
尖叫声、争吵声和警报声持续了近一分钟，直到碇做出了决定，打破了沉默：

"Prep the Second Child and deploy Unit-02 to Terminal Dogma. **All** unauthorized personnel are to vacate Central Dogma." The Supreme Commander said in a voice that brooked no opposition as Major Katsuragi felt like he was staring right at her as she gritted her teeth in defeat and marched out with the rest of the bridge crew.  
"准备第二适任者，将二号机部署至最终教条区。所有未经授权人员立即撤离中央教条。" 最高指挥官以不容置疑的口吻说道，葛城美里少校感到他仿佛正盯着自己，她咬牙切齿地败下阵来，与桥上其他人员一同离开。

"Are you sure that is wise Gendo?" Vice-Commander Fuyutsuki asked as Unit-02 activated and began moving to the shaft that led to Terminal Dogma.  
"你确定这样做明智吗，源堂？" 副指挥官冬月问道，此时二号机已启动并开始向通往最终教条区的通道移动。

"Wise or not we are left with no alternative that doesn't risk Unit-01." Gendo said in resignation as Central Dogma's large monitors showed Unit-02 progressing through the various gates and locks to the most heavily guarded place mankind had ever constructed.  
"无论是否明智，我们别无选择，不能让初号机冒险。" 源堂无奈地说道，中央教条的大型显示屏上，二号机正穿过层层关卡和门禁，向人类有史以来最严密守护的地方前进。

Unit-02 made its way through the large doors and into the central elevator shaft where a waiting high strength cable let the red mech descend through kilometers of guarded and gated passageway. Reaching the bottom, she passed through even more bolted, sealed gates, thicker than any she had ever seen in her life.  
二号机穿过巨大的门扉，进入中央电梯井，那里有一根等待的高强度缆绳，让红色的机甲沿着数公里长的守卫森严、层层设防的通道下降。到达底部后，她又穿过了更多螺栓固定、密封严实的闸门，其厚度是她此生所见之最。

Until the last set of doors opened and Asuka was greeted with the sight of pale, legless, crucified monster.  
直到最后一道门打开，明日香眼前出现了一个苍白、无腿、被钉在十字架上的怪物。

"What is that?!" She asked in incredulity, even as her Eva's feet brought her closer.  
“那是什么？！”她难以置信地问道，即便她的 Eva 脚步仍将她带得更近。

"What we are defending. Why the Angels come to Tokyo-3. If one reaches this inner sanctum and comes into contact with that being, humanity will be no more." Gendo said, giving a frank if not wholly accurate answer.  
“我们守护的是什么。为什么使徒会来到第三新东京市。如果有一个使徒到达这里并接触到那个存在，人类将不复存在。”碇源堂说道，给出了一个坦率但不完全准确的答案。

"_Gott im Himmel._" Asuka said as the true weight of their struggle, of being an Eva Pilot, finally crashed on her in a way she had never felt before.  
“我的天啊。”明日香说道，作为 EVA 驾驶员的真正重担，终于以一种她从未感受过的方式压在了她身上。

"Retrieve the Lance." Gendo ordered, breaking Asuka out of her sense of awe. Her eyes instantly recognizing a twisted, forked, weapon impaling the white behemoth that had to be what she was here to claim. She powered the red bio-mechanical unit forward and grasped at the long dark red object, straining along with her unit's muscles to pry itself free.  
“取回长枪。”碇源堂命令道，打破了明日香的敬畏感。她的眼睛立刻认出了一把扭曲的分叉武器，插在那个白色的巨兽身上，那一定是她来此要夺取的东西。她启动红色生物机械单位向前，抓住那根长长的暗红色物体，与她的单位肌肉一起用力，试图将其拔出。

"Wha-?" Asuka said as she saw the legs regenerate instantly after the Lance finally came loose.  
"什——？" 明日香看到那双腿在长矛终于松开后瞬间再生，不禁惊呼。

"You will tell **no one** of what you have seen here. Now save Pilot Ayanami" Gendo's stern voice sounded over her radio and interrupted the cascading confusion and uncertainty in her mind as he reminded her, she had a comrade to aid.  
"你不得向任何人透露你在此所见。现在去救绫波零" 碇司令严厉的声音通过她的无线电传来，打断了她脑海中不断蔓延的困惑与不安，提醒她还有一位战友需要援助。

"Understood." Asuka said as she gritted her teeth and filed all of the questions swirling in her mind away for later as she guided her unit back toward the lift to the surface, hoping that Rei was still okay.  
"明白。" 明日香咬紧牙关，将心中盘旋的所有疑问暂时搁置，操控着她的机体返回通往地面的升降机，心中祈祷着绫波依然安然无恙。

Pilot Ayanami was very much not okay.  
绫波零驾驶员现在非常不好。

"It's unravelling my mind Ikari. It's violating my mind, what do I do?" Rei pleaded as she sat in the fetal position in her entry plug. Tears escaping from her eyelids as her mind, heart, and soul roiled under the barrage of Arael's assault.  
“碇，它在撕裂我的思维。它在侵犯我的心灵，我该怎么办？”绫波坐在插入栓里，蜷缩成胎儿的姿势，恳求着。泪水从她的眼睑中滑落，她的心智、心灵和灵魂在 Arael 的攻击下翻腾不已。

None were able to hear Rei's pleas or whimpers though as everything except the emergency life support systems of her Unit-00, including communications and recordings, had been deactivated in an attempt to protect her mind as much as possible. Along with the surrounding city as a berserk Eva under mental attack was not something desired.  
然而，没有人能听到绫波的恳求或呜咽，因为除了她的零号机的紧急生命支持系统外，包括通讯和记录在内的所有设备都已被关闭，以尽可能保护她的心智。同时，为了防止一台在精神攻击下发狂的 EVA 对城市造成破坏，周围的城市也被隔离了。

Finally, though the red form of Unit-02 appeared on the surface, Asuka holding the Lance of Longinus two handed above her Eva's head as the targeting computer and NERV's Magi supercomputers calculated the optimum angles and power output needed for the Lance to strike true.  
终于，红色形态的二号机浮出水面，明日香双手高举隆基努斯之枪于 EVA 头顶，目标锁定计算机与 NERV 的 MAGI 超级计算机正计算着最佳角度与功率输出，以确保长枪一击必中。

Asuka Langley Sohryu unleashed a primal battle cry as the data told her it was time. Her Eva gave a running start before its arms hurled the ancient weapon into the atmosphere, the rainclouds drenching Tokyo-3 banished instantly from the force of the Lance of Longinus escaping Earth's gravity well until it reached Arael.  
明日香·兰格雷发出原始的战斗呐喊，数据告诉她时机已到。她的 EVA 疾跑几步，双臂将这古老武器猛掷入大气层，瞬间驱散了笼罩第三新东京市的雨云，隆基努斯之枪挣脱地球引力束缚，直抵阿瑞尔。

Archaic mechanisms more akin to sorcery than science that allowed it to breach any AT field activated and the orange octagons that had protected the 15th Angel shattered as the Lance pierced its hide and shattered its core before momentum carried it into a terminal lunar orbit.  
这些古老机制更像是魔法而非科学，使其能突破任何激活的 AT 力场，保护第十五使徒的橙色八角形屏障在长枪穿透其外皮并粉碎核心时破碎，随后长枪因惯性进入月球轨道。

Recovery teams rushed to the beleaguered Unit-00 confirming the pilot's status as the bridge crew milled back into Central Dogma to begin the clean-up process.  
救援队伍急速赶往受困的零号机，确认驾驶员状态，而指挥桥的成员们则陆续返回中央教条区，开始清理工作。

"Return Pilot Ayanami to Dogma for quarantine." Gendo ordered as he saw the video feed of a definitely worse for wear Rei in a NERV vehicle heading to the Geofront. "Fuyutsuki, finish this for me." He added to the old sensei as he headed to the personal elevator he had behind his station in Central Dogma.  
“将绫波零送回教条区进行隔离。”碇源堂命令道，他看到视频中明显状态不佳的绫波零正乘坐 NERV 车辆前往地底都市。“冬月，这里交给你了。”他对老教授补充道，随即走向位于中央教条区他工作台后的私人电梯。

The lights of countless levels passed by him as he made his labyrinthine way towards NERV's more secret areas. His face unreadable despite there being none to see it.  
无数层灯光在他眼前掠过，他穿梭于 NERV 更为隐秘的区域，尽管无人目睹，他的表情依旧难以捉摸。

The elevator finally came to a stop as Gendo exited and walked forward to find a seated First Child in the place where she had been made years ago, the old furniture and rusting medical instruments giving off an aura of decay.  
电梯终于停了下来，源渡走出电梯，向前走去，发现第一适格者坐在多年前她被制造出来的地方，老旧的家具和生锈的医疗仪器散发着衰败的气息。

"Rei? Are you okay?" He asked, concern etched into his voice. Though less for the replaceable vessel in front of him and more for his own scenario.  
“绫波？你还好吗？”他问道，声音中带着关切。尽管这份关心更多的是出于他自己的处境，而非眼前这个可替换的容器。

Rei Ayanami stayed silent for a long moment, her hands balled up on the knees of her plugsuit, eyes staring at the floor before she tilted her face up:  
绫波零沉默了许久，双手紧握着插入栓服的膝盖，眼睛盯着地板，然后她抬起脸来：

"Commander…I…" "指挥官…我…"

**A/N:** This chapter, my God it was hard to write, though I do always hear anything having to do with Arael is. As always let me know what you thought about it.  
作者注：这一章，天哪，写起来真难，虽然我总是听说任何与 Arael 有关的内容都很难写。一如既往，请告诉我你对这一章的看法。

For those wanting Unit-01 to have been involved somehow, one thing we know about Gendo is that he will not risk it, or more accurately Yui, unless he has no other option. Also, I wanted to present how things could have gone in the show if Asuka had just listened to orders, since Rei was initially supposed to lead which would have left Asuka as the one to get the lance and save her, likely restoring her damaged pride. So ironically in canon Asuka's spiral was caused in part by her own stubbornness.  
对于那些希望零号机以某种方式参与的人，我们知道源堂除非别无选择，否则不会冒险，更准确地说，不会冒险于唯。此外，我想展示如果明日香只是听从命令，事情在剧中可能会如何发展，因为最初是丽领导，这将使明日香成为获取长枪并拯救她的人，很可能恢复她受损的骄傲。所以具有讽刺意味的是，在正史中，明日香的螺旋部分是由她自己的固执造成的。

Also, I realized to my horror as I rewatched the series and looked at the Katsuragi Apartment floorplan that in canon the shower lacks a glass door, it has one of those curtains instead. So, let's just all agree there were some Butterfly Effect shenanigans that got Misato to splurge on some remodeling.  
此外，当我重温系列并查看葛城公寓的平面图时，我惊恐地发现，在正典中，淋浴间没有玻璃门，而是用那种帘子代替。所以，我们不妨一致认为，由于某种蝴蝶效应的恶作剧，让美里破费进行了一些翻新。

### A Shower Guest Special III: Überraschung

Asuka Langley Sohryu, Second Child, designated pilot of NERV's Evangelion Unit-02, and transfer student to Class 2-A trudged up the last flight of stairs to reach the walkway that led to the Katsuragi apartment, her eyes gleaming with murderous hatred as a low growl escaped her. It was that last title though that had her fuming now, rather than the fact the elevator was out of order.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷，第二适格者，NERV 所属福音战士二号机的指定驾驶员，以及二年级 A 班的转学生，拖着沉重的步伐爬上通往葛城公寓的最后一层楼梯，眼中闪烁着杀意，低沉的咆哮从她口中逸出。正是这最后一个头衔让她此刻怒火中烧，而非电梯故障这一事实。

"_It's my turn today?!" Asuka had blurted out just as she was about to run out of the classroom before she fell into a boredom coma._  
“今天轮到我了？！”明日香在即将因无聊而昏昏欲睡地跑出教室前脱口而出。

"_Yes Asuka, we're the two on the schedule today." Her 'friend' Hikari Horaki responded with her trademarked matter-of-fact tone._  
“是的，明日香，今天是我们俩值班。”她的‘朋友’Hikari Horaki 以她标志性的实事求是语气回应道。

"_Oh that's just rich! They sure know how to pick 'em!"The German redhead remarked bitterly as she slammed her bag into the nearest defenseless desk._  
“哦，真是讽刺！他们还真会挑人！”德国红发女孩愤愤不平地说着，猛地将她的包摔向最近的无辜课桌。

_Hikari sighed, her face pointed downwards, grateful that Asuka chose to take her anger out on something that wasn't living.  
光叹了口气，脸朝下低垂着，庆幸明日香选择把怒气发泄在无生命的物体上。_

'Why do the Japanese have to clean their own classrooms! Don't they have janitors for that! Argghh!' Asuka internally screamed as she made her way toward the door and opened it.  
“为什么日本人得自己打扫教室！他们没有清洁工吗！啊啊啊！”明日香内心咆哮着，走向门口并打开了它。

'And this baka! Running out of the school so fast he couldn't eve-' her internal tirade stopped though as the door hissed close and her nostrils picked up the aromas filling their home.  
“这个笨蛋！跑得那么快，连——”她内心的抱怨戛然而止，因为门轻轻合上，她的鼻尖捕捉到了家中弥漫的香气。

"Baka Shinji." Her lips said softly before forming a knowing smile as she took off her shoes and made her way as stealthily as she could to the kitchen.  
“笨蛋真嗣。”她轻声呢喃，嘴角勾起一抹会心的微笑，脱下鞋子，尽可能悄无声息地向厨房走去。

She saw him, back to her, opening up the oven in the kitchen, taking out a tray of freshly made dinner rolls and placing them in a basket, totally unaware as she tiptoed towards him.  
她看到他背对着她，在厨房里打开烤箱，取出刚烤好的晚餐卷放入篮子，全然不知她正蹑手蹑脚地向他靠近。

"Oww! What's that for?!" Shinji said as he felt a pinch in his side just as he put down the hot tray.  
“哎哟！这是干嘛？！”真嗣说着，刚放下热腾腾的托盘，就感到腰侧被掐了一下。

"For conniving with Hikari to put me on the cleaning schedule today." Asuka answered, putting two and two together the genius that she was before looping her arms around him and putting a kiss on his cheek.  
“因为你和光合谋把我安排在今天的清洁计划里。”明日香回答道，以她的聪明才智迅速理清了情况，然后双臂环住他，在他脸颊上轻轻一吻。

"Sorry." Shinji said contritely, a smile on his face though, before explaining. "But I needed time for the surprise." His hand gestured toward the table, long, slender, lavender candles waited for a match on either side of a vase of expertly arranged red and blue roses with pale hortensia. Asuka removed her arms from her lover's torso and walked over to her usual chair that had something draped over it.  
“对不起。”真嗣诚恳地说，脸上却带着笑意，接着解释道，“但我需要时间准备这个惊喜。”他指向桌子，长长的、细长的薰衣草色蜡烛在花瓶两侧等待着火柴，花瓶里是精心搭配的红蓝玫瑰和淡色绣球花。明日香从爱人的腰间抽回手臂，走向她常坐的椅子，上面盖着什么东西。

The German redhead picked it up and realized it was a backless black dress she'd bought but never had the chance to wear.  
那位德国红发女孩捡起它，发现是一件她买下却从未有机会穿的无背黑色连衣裙。

"Why don't you get ready, I'll finish cooking." Shinji said as he pulled out a cast iron pan and set in on the stove.  
“你去准备一下，我来完成烹饪。”真嗣说着，拿出一个铸铁平底锅放在炉子上。

Asuka, dress in hand, went up to Shinji, bending forward and puckering her lips. Shinji reciprocated and they shared a kiss before the German redhead went to her room to change. There she saw a single red rose in a vase, with two cards leaned against it and a ribboned box to the side.  
手里拿着衣服的明日香走到真嗣面前，身体前倾，撅起嘴唇。真嗣回应了她的动作，两人接吻后，这位德国红发女孩便去房间换衣服。在那里，她看到一个花瓶里插着一朵红玫瑰，两张卡片斜靠在花瓶旁，旁边还有一个系着丝带的盒子。

She looked at the two cards first. One was from Hikari, the other from Misato. The former was full of the standard well-wishes, while the latter filled with teasing and innuendo but ended with the NERV Major telling Asuka she'd be in the Geofront until morning.  
她先看了看那两张卡片。一张来自光，另一张来自美里。前者满是标准的祝福，而后者则充满了戏谑和暗示，但最后 NERV 的作战部长告诉明日香她会在地底都市待到早上。

Asuka laughed as she concluded that Misato knowing about their relationship did have its advantages now and then.  
明日香笑着得出结论，知道他们关系的美里偶尔还是有些好处的。

She then turned to the present. It had a simple card on it, with Shinji's best try at Latin letters written on it:  
接着她转向礼物。上面有一张简单的卡片，上面是真嗣尽力用拉丁字母写下的字句：

_**Alles Gute zum Geburtstag Asuka  
祝你生日快乐，明日香**_

She smiled and set the card to the side gently as she opened the box to reveal a silver bracelet. It was separated into numerous slanted segments, each no more than a millimeter or two wide if her eye was right, with each end tapering into a shiny red stone that sparkled in the sunlight that crept through her room's blinds.  
她微笑着轻轻将卡片放在一旁，打开盒子，里面是一条银色手链。手链由许多斜切的片段组成，每个片段宽度不超过一两毫米，如果她的眼睛没看错的话，每个末端都逐渐变细，镶嵌着一颗闪亮的红宝石，在透过她房间百叶窗的阳光下熠熠生辉。

"Wunderschönen…, Baka." Asuka said before stripping out of her school uniform and heading to the shower, black dress and bracelet in hand.  
「真漂亮……，笨蛋。」明日香说着，脱下校服，手里拿着黑色连衣裙和手链，走向淋浴间。

In under twenty minutes, a new record for any keeping track, Asuka had washed, dressed and put on her make-up before heading back to the kitchen.  
不到二十分钟，对于任何有记录的人来说，这是一个新纪录，明日香已经洗漱、穿衣并化了妆，然后回到了厨房。

"You look amazing Asuka." Shinji said as he put the last plate on the table.  
“你看起来真美，明日香。”真嗣说着，将最后一个盘子放在了桌上。

"Well of course!" She said in the confident tone she used at school and NERV, as her right wrist went up to dramatically brush her hair back while her left rested on her waist, striking a pose before continuing: "I'm the one and only Asuka Langley Sohryu!"  
“当然啦！”她用在学校和 NERV 时那种自信的语气说道，右手腕戏剧性地向后一甩，将头发撩起，同时左手搭在腰间，摆出一个姿势，接着说：“我就是独一无二的惣流·明日香·兰格雷！”

"So you liked it?" Shinji said in a calm glad tone, not fazed by Asuka's theatrics, and realizing their aim was to show him she was wearing the red bejeweled bracelet.  
"所以你喜欢它吗？" 真嗣用平静而高兴的语气说道，并未被明日香夸张的表演所动摇，意识到她的目的是向他展示她戴着那只镶有红宝石的手镯。

"Yeah." Asuka said her tone growing quiet and contented as her faux smile was replaced by a genuine one as she looked at the gift as a question popped in her mind: "How'd you find it?"  
"嗯。" 明日香的声音变得柔和而满足，她那假装的微笑被真诚的笑容所取代，她看着礼物，心中突然冒出一个问题："你是怎么找到它的？"

"Hikari helped." Shinji answered by way of explanation as he struck a match, lit the two candles, and pulled out Asuka's seat so she could sit down, though not before he got a chance to plant a kiss on her bare back. His warm breath sending tingling electricity through Asuka's body and her limbs shivered unbiddenly as she sat and Ikari scooched her chair in.  
"光帮忙的。" 真嗣解释道，同时划燃一根火柴，点燃了两根蜡烛，并拉出明日香的椅子让她坐下，尽管在此之前他有机会在她赤裸的背上轻轻一吻。他温暖的呼吸让明日香的身体感到一阵酥麻，她的四肢不由自主地颤抖着，坐下后，真嗣帮她把椅子推了进去。

'She probably helped with a lot of this. Misato too' Asuka thought as her brain regained function and she looked at the romantic dinner spread before them and made a mental note to do something nice for the cougar and angel.  
"'她大概帮了不少忙。美里也是。' 明日香心想，当她的大脑恢复功能，目光落在眼前浪漫的晚餐布置上，暗自记下要为这位猎豹和天使做些什么好事。

Shinji had made steak and carrots just the way she liked it. The meat rare and the carrots tender but not mush. Shinji personally preferred his steak well done and could swear Asuka's was still mooing.  
真嗣做的牛排和胡萝卜正是她喜欢的。肉是半熟的，胡萝卜软而不烂。真嗣自己偏爱全熟的牛排，甚至可以发誓明日香的牛排还在哞哞叫。

They ate and made small talk, sharing jokes and stories as their laughter filled the cozy apartment. Their plates empty and the last buttered roll in Asuka's hands she brought her bare foot to Shinji's leg under the table, her toes curling around the soft material of his dark slacks:  
他们边吃边聊，分享笑话和故事，笑声充满了温馨的公寓。盘子空了，最后一卷黄油面包在明日香手中，她将赤裸的脚伸到桌下真嗣的腿上，脚趾缠绕在他深色裤子的柔软布料上：

"Let's go." She said, her tone enticing, her head making a little movement in the direction of their bedrooms as her teeth dug into the roll. The crust giving an audible 'crunch' before giving way to the fluffy, gooey interior.  
"走吧。" 她说道，语气诱人，头微微偏向卧室的方向，牙齿咬入面包卷，外皮发出清脆的'咔嚓'声，随后是松软黏稠的内馅。

"Of course." Shinji said before standing and walking over to his lover, pulling her chair out, and taking her hand. But instead of leading her to the bedroom he took her toward the living room as Asuka's brow furrowed.  
"当然。" 真嗣说着站起身，走到爱人身边，拉开她的椅子，握住她的手。但他没有带她去卧室，而是走向客厅，这让明日香皱起了眉头。

"Not on the couch ba-" Asuka began, her tone filled with displeasure before she noticed what was on the table in front of it. A bottle of massage oil. Her look of displeasure was instead replaced by a mischievous looking grin. "My feet are killing me Shinji." She began before looking into his eyes and sparkling cerulean met crisp cobalt: "Can you help?" She said as she sat on the couch and placed her feet on the table.  
"不是在沙发上吧——" 明日香开口，语气充满不悦，但随即注意到沙发前的桌子上放着一瓶按摩油。她脸上的不悦被狡黠的笑容取代。"我的脚疼死了，真嗣。" 她开始说道，目光与他对视，清澈的蔚蓝与深邃的钴蓝相遇："你能帮忙吗？" 她边说边坐在沙发上，把脚放在桌子上。

"Sure thing Asu-uuuka…!" Shinji exclaimed, his tone shifting from its normal cadence to one of embarrassed surprise as he knelt down in front of Asuka's feet to get in a good position to work on the knots and sore muscles only to realize the dress and bracelet were the only things she was wearing.  
“当然可以，Asu-uuuka…！” 真嗣惊呼道，他的语气从平常的节奏转变为尴尬的惊讶，他跪在明日香脚前，准备好好处理那些结块和酸痛的肌肉，却突然意识到她身上只穿着那件连衣裙和手镯。

"I'm waiting Shinji…" Asuka said, her feet rocking back and forth, after failing to stifle a giggle at how red Shinji's face was. 'Seriously baka this is like the thousandth time you've seen it, why are you still staring?' Despite the words echoing in her mind her heart still felt like there were butterflies trying to escape it at how after all this time the sight of her could make him blush, that he wasn't bored with her, that he wouldn't leave her.  
“我在等你呢，真嗣…” 明日香说，她的脚前后摇晃着，尽管努力忍住笑意，但还是被真嗣通红的脸逗乐了。‘真是的，笨蛋，这都第几千次了，你怎么还在盯着看？’尽管这些话在她脑海中回响，但她的心仍感觉像是有蝴蝶在试图飞出来，因为经过了这么长时间，看到她还能让他脸红，他并没有对她感到厌倦，他不会离开她。

Finally Shinji regained some of his composure and there was an audible pop as he opened the bottle and let the cool oil pour onto his hands before beginning to rub Asuka's feet.  
最终，真嗣恢复了一些镇定，随着一声响亮的“啵”，他打开了瓶子，让清凉的油流到手上，然后开始按摩明日香的脚。

'Heh…his technique's gotten better.' Asuka mused as she felt the tension in her muscles melt away under Shinji's attention.  
“嘿……他的手法进步了。”明日香暗自思忖，感受着在真嗣的按摩下，肌肉的紧张逐渐消散。

He used the palm of his hand to rub the soles of her feet, getting her muscles to relax at the outset, before moving on to her Achilles tendon and splaying her toes with his fingers to ensure not one of the hundred muscles in the human foot was left wanting.  
他先用掌心揉搓她的脚底，让肌肉放松，然后移至她的跟腱，用手指分开她的脚趾，确保人类脚部的一百块肌肉无一被忽视。

Her feet pampered, Shinji got up from his knees and leaned forward, his right knee going between Asuka's legs and pushing the fabric of the dress too her opening just as their lips met. The wetness quickly seeping through the thin fabric and onto Shinji's slacks. Just like he knew it would. For as much as he said, well thought really, he'd never had said it to her face, that Asuka was a tease when they'd first met, it was Shinji that knew what buttons to push.  
脚部得到充分照顾后，真嗣从跪姿起身，向前倾身，右膝插入明日香的双腿之间，将裙子的布料推向她的私密处，就在他们的唇相触的那一刻。湿润感迅速透过薄薄的布料渗入真嗣的裤子上。正如他所预料的那样。尽管他从未当面说过，或者说，心里确实想过，但自从他们初次相遇时，明日香就是个爱挑逗的人，而真嗣则深谙如何触动她的心弦。

If before Asuka had felt the creeping hint of lust in the back of her mind, it was now an unstoppable siren's song.  
如果之前明日香心中还只是隐约感觉到欲望的悄然滋生，那么此刻它已化作无法抵挡的海妖之歌。

Her tongue shot into Shinji's mouth as her hips ground against his knee as her hormones took over from her conscious mind.  
她的舌头猛地探入真嗣的口中，同时臀部紧贴着他的膝盖摩擦，荷尔蒙彻底接管了她的理智。

"Kiss them too, would you." Asuka purred in a quiet voice as the kiss ended.  
“也亲亲它们，好吗。”接吻结束后，明日香轻声呢喃，声音中带着一丝诱惑。

Shinji nodded in response, knowing exactly what she meant. She spread open her legs as Shinji's hands lifted up the hem of her dress, her slit visible even in the low light of the apartment. Her pink inner lips just pushing past the alabaster of her outside ones while Shinji could swear that he saw her most sensitive nub throbbing in anticipation.  
真嗣点头回应，完全明白她的意思。她张开双腿，真嗣的手掀起她的裙摆，即使在昏暗的公寓灯光下，她的私处也清晰可见。粉嫩的内唇微微露出，比外侧的雪白更加显眼，而真嗣几乎可以发誓，他看到她最敏感的小核因期待而跳动。

He began slowly. Planting kisses on her inner thigh and her stomach just above her mound, making a clockwise spiral until he eventually reached her outer labia. His tongue swiped up and down across them slowly before testing her gates. Penetrating slowly into her, he could feel her taste on the tip of his tongue. That fleshy, wet, sometimes salty flavor of a woman.  
他开始缓慢地行动，在她的大腿内侧和阴阜上方的小腹上留下吻痕，顺时针螺旋式前进，最终到达她的外阴唇。他的舌头缓缓地上下舔舐，然后试探性地探入。慢慢地深入，他能在舌尖感受到她的味道，那种肉感、湿润，有时带点咸味的女性滋味。

Shinji then picked up the pace, whereas before he was cautious he now furiously struck his tongue back and forth against her insides while his hands went up to her breasts. The fact Asuka wasn't wearing a bra making it easy for him to get access to her fleshy orbs and sensitive nipples.  
随后，真嗣加快了节奏，之前的小心翼翼已不复存在，他现在疯狂地用舌头来回冲击她的内部，同时双手伸向她的乳房。由于明日香没有穿胸罩，这让他很容易就能触及她那丰满的乳房和敏感的乳头。

Asuka, after recovering from the onslaught brought her hands to Shinji's head, her fingers twisting around in Shinji's brown locks, but rather than push him away or try to regain a form of control, she pulled his face forward. Causing his nose to brush and strike her clit as she ground his hips into his face.  
明日香在从冲击中恢复过来后，双手抚上了真嗣的头部，手指缠绕在他棕色的发丝中，但她并未推开他或试图重新掌控局面，而是将他的脸拉向前。她的动作使得他的鼻子轻触并撞击她的阴蒂，同时她将他的臀部压向他的脸。

'She must be closer than I though.' Shinji's mind managed to think between Asuka's shocking actions and the oxygen deprivation.  
'她一定比我想象的还要近。' 在明日香令人震惊的举动和氧气不足之间，真嗣的思绪勉强运转着。

He managed to get his nose above water, and pulled his right hand from Asuka's breasts so that his musician's fingers could replace his tongue in the ministration of her insides, curling and striking the wrinkly folds that made up her walls while his mouth closed around the peak of her mound and his tongue played with her clitoris sending a croaking moan to Asuka's mouth as her peak crashed into her and her already black dress became a shade darker between her thighs at the wetness seeping from her.  
他设法将鼻子探出水面，并从明日香的胸部抽出右手，让他的音乐家手指代替舌头在她体内进行抚慰，弯曲并触碰构成她内壁的皱褶，同时他的嘴紧贴她阴阜的顶峰，舌头逗弄着她的阴蒂，随着她的高潮涌入，她发出嘶哑的呻吟，她那本已黑色的裙子在她大腿间因渗出的湿润而变得更深了一层。

Shinji brought his face up from her twitching lower lips, the dying candlelight from the table revealing the light sheen on his cheeks as he planted a kiss on the lips of her face.  
真嗣从她抽搐的下唇抬起脸，桌上即将燃尽的烛光映出他脸颊上淡淡的光泽，他轻轻吻在她的脸颊上。

Their lips were still locked together when Shinji felt the tell tale sensation of his slacks zipper being undone and the garment falling to the ground along with his boxers. The cool air of the apartment against his privates though was soon replaced by the heat of Asuka's hands stroking his already stiff member into standing fully at attention before Shinji felt his body moving.  
当真嗣感觉到裤子的拉链被拉开，裤子连同内裤一起掉落在地时，他们的嘴唇仍然紧贴在一起。虽然公寓的凉风拂过他的私处，但很快就被明日香双手抚摸他早已坚挺的部位所产生的热量所取代，真嗣感觉到自己的身体开始移动。

Without separating her lips from his Asuka managed to twist Shinji around so he was now sitting on the couch and she was straddling him, the flowing fabric of her dress covering the lower sections of their body.  
明日香没有分开与他的唇，设法将真嗣扭转过来，让他坐在沙发上，而她则跨坐在他身上，她裙子的流动布料遮住了他们身体的下半部分。

'That's the combat training.' Shinji's subconscious absently told him in a little voice as he suddenly found himself at Asuka's mercy.  
"'那是战斗训练。' 真嗣的潜意识不经意间用微小的声音告诉他，他突然发现自己处于明日香的掌控之中。

The German redhead ended the kiss and stood up in front of the couch, undoing the clasps of her dress and letting it fall to the floor before resuming her place atop Shinji, though not before his shirt joined the rest of their clothes on the floor.  
"这位德国红发少女结束了亲吻，站在沙发前，解开连衣裙的搭扣，让它滑落到地板上，然后重新回到真嗣上方，尽管在此之前，他的衬衫也加入了他们散落在地板上的衣物中。

She really did honestly prefer the bed, but she also really honestly did not want to wait as her hand went behind her back and guided Shinji's member to her waiting entrance, barely remembering to moisten the cockhead with her own juices before pushing herself on top of it until she felt the wrinkles of Shinji's balls tickle her ass.  
"她确实真心更喜欢床，但她也非常真心不想等待，她的手伸到背后，引导真嗣的成员到她等待的入口，几乎记得在将自己推到上面之前用她自己的体液湿润龟头，直到她感觉到真嗣的阴囊的褶皱轻触她的臀部。

Having obeyed the little voice from her subconscious repeating 'Now, _now,_ _**now!**_' Asuka paused and looked into Shinji's blues, a smile forming on her lips, and on Shinji's as they saw the contentment and love in the other's face before their eyes closed, their lips locked, their hands joined together, and hips began moving.  
听从内心深处那个不断重复的'现在，现在，现在！'的声音，明日香停下脚步，凝视着真嗣的蓝眼睛，嘴角浮现出微笑，真嗣也回以微笑，他们从彼此的脸上看到了满足和爱意，随后双眼闭合，双唇相接，双手紧握，腰肢开始摆动。

They began slowly at first, before speeding up. Their hips moving in that perfect synchronization that came from when two people knew each other completely, their rhythm letting the pleasure hit deeper than normal, as a whimper escaped Asuka into their joined mouths as Shinji's rock hard member struck a particularly sensitive spot of Asuka's burning insides.  
起初他们动作缓慢，随后逐渐加快。他们的腰肢以一种完美的同步性摆动，这种默契源自两人对彼此的完全了解，他们的节奏让快感比平时更加深入，随着真嗣坚硬的部位触碰到明日香炽热体内特别敏感的一点，一声呻吟从他们紧贴的唇间逸出。

Still being sensitive from Shinji's earlier attentions, Asuka felt the tingling fire within her kindling quickly as her hips seemingly moved of their own volition determined to reach that peak again as quickly as possible.  
由于真嗣之前的挑逗，明日香仍然感到敏感，她体内的酥麻之火迅速燃起，仿佛腰肢自有意志般，决心尽快再次达到巅峰。

Asuka stopped her movements as Shinji felt her body shiver on top of him and her muffled lips spoke his name as she came as her hands squeezed his tight as Shinji stopped his own thrusts, content to let his member feel the tightening of Asuka's walls around it as her juices flowed out of her. The wrinkles of his tightened sack acting as canals for the fluid as it made its way towards the couch cushions. The cool liquid sending a shiver of pleasure up Shinji's spine as his tongue shot into their joined mouths as he slowly began moving again.  
当真嗣感觉到明日香在他身上颤抖，她那被压抑的嘴唇呼唤着他的名字，随着她的双手紧紧抓住他，真嗣停止了自己的动作，满足于让他的部位感受明日香体内壁的紧缩，她的体液随之流出。他紧绷的囊袋上的皱纹仿佛成了液体的通道，使其流向沙发垫。冰凉的液体让真嗣的脊背一阵快感颤栗，他的舌头猛地伸入他们紧贴的唇间，然后缓缓开始再次移动。

Asuka took one of her hands away from Shinji's grip and reached behind her. Lithe fingertips going to the edges of Shinji's balls where they connected to his body before closing together and meeting before going back again.  
明日香从真嗣的紧握中抽出一只手，伸向背后。纤细的手指触及真嗣的睾丸与身体相连的边缘，然后合拢，相遇，再分开。

She repeated this massage and twisted her own hips around counterclockwise half a dozen times before Shinji's self-control failed and she felt his hot cum shoot inside her, spreading a warmness and completeness inside of her.  
她重复了这个按摩动作，并逆时针扭动自己的臀部半打次，直到真嗣的自制力崩溃，她感觉到他的热液射入她体内，带来一种温暖和完整感。

Their lips finally parted, the apartment that was until moments ago filled with rhythmic slaps and suppressed moans now became filled with the sound of panting breaths and heaving chests as the two lovers rested their torsos against one another.  
他们的唇终于分开，原本充斥着节奏拍击声和压抑呻吟的公寓，此刻被急促的喘息声和起伏的胸膛所填满，两位恋人相互依偎着休息。

"Happy Birthday Asuka." Shinji said as blood slowly returned to the thinking organ.  
"生日快乐，明日香。" 真嗣说道，血液慢慢回流至思考的器官。

"Thank you" Asuka began as she kissed his cheek before adding "baka" in her tender tone reserved for the afterglow as her head rested against his chest as his arms encircled her in a tight embrace.  
"谢谢你" 明日香开始说道，她亲吻了他的脸颊，然后以温柔的语气补充道 "笨蛋"，这是她在余韵中特有的语调，她的头靠在他的胸前，他的手臂紧紧环绕着她。

Asuka's mind went over all the things that had changed in her life since her last birthday. How she had changed. She'd always liked her birthday, one more notch on her way to adulthood and respect in the eyes of others, but now, she reflected, this was the first one in a long time where she felt safe and loved. It hadn't been a straight road, there'd been pitfalls, dangers around every corner and the future still laid uncertain beyond the dark horizon.  
明日香的心中回顾了自上次生日以来生活中发生的所有变化，以及她自身的变化。她一直喜欢自己的生日，这是通往成年和他人尊重之路上的又一个标记，但现在，她反思道，这是久违以来第一个让她感到安全和被爱的生日。这条路并非一帆风顺，处处陷阱，危机四伏，而未来仍笼罩在黑暗的地平线之外，充满不确定性。

'But,' her mind began as her fingers clenched around Shinji's chest, 'As long as we're here together, I know it'll be okay.'  
'但是，'她的手指紧握着真嗣的胸膛，心中开始默念，'只要我们在一起，我就知道一切都会好起来的。'

**A/N:** So here's another short Special. I wrote it for several reasons the main one being the episode with Armisael is dense and is going to need a lot of thought. The other being that canonically Asuka's birthday is the 4th of December, though in the show it is not clear when this is, though likely in Episode 22. With convincing arguments that it is either the day when Asuka's step-mother called, because of course family calls on your birthday, or the day of Arael's attack because the irony and bad luck is too perfect, but no definitive canon answer. So instead of putting Asuka's birthday in the previous chapter I thought I'd make a Special about it.  
作者注：这是另一篇特别的短篇。我写它的原因有几个，最主要的是关于阿米莎耶的那一集内容密集，需要深入思考。另一个原因是，根据设定，明日香的生日是 12 月 4 日，但在剧中并未明确指出具体时间，虽然很可能在第 22 集。有说服力的观点认为，要么是明日香继母打电话的那天，因为家人通常会在生日当天联系，要么是阿莱尔攻击的那天，因为这种讽刺和坏运气太过完美，但没有确切的官方答案。因此，我没有在前一章中提及明日香的生日，而是决定为此写一篇特别篇。

As always let me know what you think and strap yourself in for the next four chapters, and maybe an epilogue, because we're nearing the denouement of this story.  
一如既往地，请告诉我你的想法，并准备好迎接接下来的四章，或许还有一个尾声，因为我们即将迎来这个故事的高潮。

But those are going to take some time to get right, so monthly updates are unlikely, but this story will be finished.  
但这些章节需要一些时间来完善，所以不太可能每月更新，但这个故事一定会完结。

**Katsuragi Apartment: After School  
葛城公寓：放学后**

Pen Pen lay in his freezer staring at the ceiling with his fingered flippers desperately trying to hold his pillow tighter to the dark holes that were his ears against the racket coming from the living room.  
Pen Pen 躺在他的冰箱里，用他那有指蹼的鳍状肢拼命将枕头压紧在耳朵上，试图隔绝来自客厅的噪音，眼睛则盯着天花板。

"Hah!" “哈！”

"Here I go!" “我来了！”

"Right there!" "就是那里！"

Yes! Yes! Yes!" 对！对！对！

"That's it!" "就是这样！"

"Agghhh!" “啊！”

**Player 2 Wins!** The game console displayed in red lettering as the character Asuka chose in the fighting game they were playing struck a victory pose.  
“玩家 2 获胜！”游戏机以红色字体显示，他们正在玩的格斗游戏中，明日香选择的角色摆出了胜利的姿势。

"Got you Third!" Asuka exclaimed loudly, reverting back to the old pejorative she used when she was being competitive. "Now pay up!"  
“抓到你了，第三名！”明日香大声喊道，恢复了过去竞争时常用的贬义词。“现在付钱吧！”

Shinji sighed as he put down the controller, stood up, and unbuttoned his school pants before handing the garment over to the redhead who tossed it in the pile of the other clothes she'd won in previous bouts.  
真嗣叹了口气，放下控制器，站起身来，解开校裤的扣子，将裤子递给了红发女孩，她随手将其扔进了之前比赛中赢来的衣物堆里。

Shinji sat back down but Asuka still had an expectant look on her face.  
真嗣重新坐下，但明日香脸上依然带着期待的表情。

"And?" She said, reminding him of the other payment owed for losing a match.  
“然后呢？”她提醒他，输掉比赛还有另一笔欠下的“报酬”。

"Oh!" Shinji said as he remembered, puckered his lips and gave his redheaded lover a peck on the lips.  
"哦！" 真嗣想起来了，噘起嘴唇，给了他那红发恋人一个轻吻。

"Good baka." Asuka said as she rapidly pressed the buttons to set up the next match before adding "You're going down Third!"  
"笨蛋。" 明日香一边迅速按下按钮准备下一场比赛，一边补充道："你这次输定了，第三名！"

Shinji rolled his eyes at her competitiveness before looking at his own pile of "won" clothes.  
真嗣对她那股好胜心翻了个白眼，然后看向自己那堆"赢来"的衣服。

'I have everything except her bra.' He reflected, not that he needed to look at the pile to know that, Asuka's semi-nude form next to him on the bean bag chair was confirmation enough. 'Why'd she give me her panties before her bra anyway? Women.' Shinji thought as Asuka was scrolling through the character options trying to decide which one to pick and Shinji smiled as he saw her vibrancy and life that had attracted him to her since when they first met.  
"'我什么都有，除了她的胸罩。' 他思索着，不需要看那堆衣物也能知道，明日香半裸着坐在他旁边的懒人沙发上，这已经足够证实了。'为什么她先给我她的内裤而不是胸罩呢？女人啊。' 真嗣想着，而明日香正在滚动角色选项，试图决定选哪一个，真嗣微笑着，看着她那自他们初次相遇以来就一直吸引着他的活力和生命力。

It was nice having time to just hang out, just the two of them, especially since their homework had become a lot less time consuming since they'd worked out their system.  
能有时间只是闲逛，只有他们两个人，这感觉真好，尤其是自从他们找到了做作业的系统后，作业变得不那么耗时了。

Since Shinji's better half was a college graduate the material assigned them was laughably easy in concept to the German redhead. However, Asuka, like many students of foreign languages, was excellent at speaking but dreadful at writing. The kanji of the Japanese language being something even her intellect had trouble fully grasping. So their solution was quite simple, talking. Shinji would read the questions out loud, Asuka would think for a moment and dictate an answer to Shinji who then wrote it down. It wasn't exactly academic honesty but the teachers didn't have to deal with Angels now did they.  
由于真嗣的另一半是大学毕业生，分配给他们的材料在概念上对这位德国红发少女来说简直是易如反掌。然而，像许多外语学习者一样，明日香擅长口语却拙于书写。日语中的汉字对她聪慧的头脑来说也是个不小的挑战。因此，他们的解决办法相当简单——对话。真嗣会大声读出问题，明日香稍作思考后口述答案，真嗣则将其记录下来。这虽算不上学术诚信，但老师们现在可不必对付使徒，不是吗？

Her character finally selected, Asuka gave one more verbal tease before hitting the start button. The couple readied their controllers in their hands as the countdown ended and the match began.  
角色终于选定，明日香在按下开始按钮前又调侃了一句。两人握紧手中的控制器，随着倒计时结束，比赛开始了。

A missed block gave Shinji an early advantage, one Asuka soon rectified with her character's special combo. The exchange of jabs, punches, kicks and laser beams, that doesn't really seem fair but okay, continued as both teens leaned forward in their seats. Jaws locked, and teeth grit as their thumbs smashed buttons to make the pixels on the screen do what they wanted. Eventually both had their health bars depleted to where even one hit would be enough. Asuka being the more aggressive of the two had her character lunge forward trying to land the final hit. But Shinji, knowing this was coming, dodged out of the way and, with Asuka's character being defenseless, struck the knockout blow with a kick to the back.  
一次失误的防守让真嗣早早占据了优势，但明日香很快用她角色的特殊连击扳回一城。双方你来我往，拳脚相加，激光乱射，虽然这似乎不太公平，但也没关系。两个少年都向前倾着身子，紧咬牙关，拇指猛击按钮，让屏幕上的像素按照他们的意愿行动。最终，两人的生命值都降到了一击必杀的地步。明日香更为激进，她的角色猛扑向前，试图打出致命一击。但真嗣早有预料，巧妙躲开，并在明日香的角色毫无防备之际，一记后踢终结了比赛。

**Player 3 Wins!** The screen declared. Shinji wasn't sure how Asuka got the game console to switch the numbering of the players, but didn't bother asking either, his thoughts on other things.  
玩家 3 获胜！屏幕上显示着。真嗣不确定明日香是如何让游戏机改变了玩家的编号，但他也没多问，心思在别的事情上。

Asuka sighed, her earlier zeal gone as she stood up from the bean bag chair a blank look on her face as she turned off the TV and came to stand in front of Shinji on his own cushion.  
明日香叹了口气，之前的激情已消失无踪，她从豆袋椅上站起身，面无表情地关掉电视，走到真嗣面前，站在他的垫子上。

Wordlessly her hand went behind her back and undid the clasp of her lacey black bra, the undergarment falling onto Shinji's lap before tumbling down his leg and resting above his left knee with each cup on either side of his bare thigh.  
她无声地伸手到背后，解开了黑色蕾丝胸罩的搭扣，内衣随即落在真嗣的腿上，顺着他的腿滑落，最终停在他的左膝上方，两个罩杯分别搭在他赤裸的大腿两侧。

"Happy now Third." Asuka deadpanned while looking into his cobalt eyes with her cerulean orbs as she stood naked before him.  
“现在高兴了吧，三号。”明日香面无表情地说道，她那蔚蓝的眼睛凝视着他深蓝色的双眸，赤裸地站在他面前。

"Asuka I-" Shinji began, the desperation evident in his voice before Asuka began laughing so hard she had to wipe a tear away from her right eye before she responded:  
“明日香，我——”真嗣开口道，声音中的绝望显而易见，但明日香已经笑得前仰后合，不得不擦去右眼的一滴泪水，才继续回应：

"Gott, you're dense baka." Asuka said, now more in control, the smile and life having returned to her face.  
"天啊，你真是迟钝的笨蛋。" 明日香说道，现在她更加掌控局面，笑容和生气重新回到了她的脸上。

"That wasn't very nice." Shinji said half-heartedly as a small grin appeared on his lips. He'd gotten better at reading Asuka's emotions, but he still had trouble knowing when she was screwing with him.  
"那样说可不太好。" 真嗣半心半意地说，嘴角露出一丝微笑。他现在已经能更好地读懂明日香的情绪，但他仍然难以判断她何时在捉弄他。

"Baka." Asuka said before she leaned down and covered his mouth with hers. This wasn't like the earlier peck or the dozen that came before that one. This was a kiss where their heads bobbed and danced, their teeth bit the other's lips, their tongues wrestled with the other, and the hot breath of the other's nose tickled their face.  
"笨蛋。" 明日香说完后俯下身，用她的唇覆盖住他的。这不同于之前的轻吻或之前的十几个吻。这是一个他们的头摇摆起舞，牙齿轻咬对方嘴唇，舌头相互缠斗，彼此鼻息的热气轻拂脸颊的吻。

"It feels like your body didn't buy my act." Asuka cooed as the kiss ended and she shifted her hips on Shinji's boxers to emphasize the point.  
"感觉你的身体没被我的演技骗到呢。" 接吻结束后，明日香轻声细语，同时在她穿着的短裤上扭动臀部以强调这一点。

"I'm so-" Shinji began as old habits die hard, before Asuka put a finger to his lips to stop the words forming.  
"我真是——" 真嗣习惯性地开口，但明日香用手指轻触他的嘴唇，阻止了话语的形成。

"Let me make it up to you." Asuka purred seductively as her hand grabbed her discarded bra and tossed it on the pile of other clothes she'd lost to Shinji before she got off Shinji's lap and grabbed the hem of his black boxers. Shinji lifted himself up off the bean bag chair to help Asuka as she pulled them down to his ankles letting his stiff member stand at attention.  
"让我补偿你。" 明日香低声诱惑地说道，她的手抓住了丢在一旁的胸罩，扔进了之前被真嗣脱下的衣物堆里。她从真嗣的腿上下来，抓住他黑色短裤的裤边。真嗣从豆袋椅上起身协助明日香，她将短裤拉到他的脚踝处，让他坚挺的部位昂首挺立。

Asuka took the cock in her hands and stared down at it, the little hole at the top twitching at her touch and seemingly staring at her as her right hand slowly went up and down his shaft. Asuka's eyes locked with Shinji's as her lips puckered and kissed the one-eyed tip.  
明日香双手握住那根东西，低头凝视着它，顶端的小孔在她触摸下微微颤动，仿佛也在盯着她看，而她的右手则缓缓地在它的柱身上下移动。明日香的目光与真嗣的紧紧相锁，她的双唇撅起，亲吻着那只独眼般的尖端。

Her lips parted and the tip slid into her wet mouth where Asuka's tongue took over. Gently caressing Shinji's cockhead all the while their eyes never broke from one another. Then the German redhead brought in more of his shaft. Her lips feeling every well-known vein and bump as they went until she had his entire member in her mouth. Her throat spasmed and gaged six times as she kept it there before relenting and slowly bringing her mouth back up to Shinji's tip as slowly as she went down and Asuka could swear neither had even blinked during the entire process.  
她的双唇分开，尖端滑入她湿润的口中，明日香的舌头随即接管，温柔地抚摸着真嗣的阴茎头，而他们的目光始终未曾分开。接着，这位德国红发女孩将更多的柱身纳入。她的双唇感受着每一处熟悉的静脉和凸起，直到她将他的整个阴茎含入口中。她的喉咙痉挛并六次哽咽，她保持这样状态片刻，然后才慢慢将嘴向上移回真嗣的尖端，就像她下去时一样缓慢，明日香敢发誓，整个过程中两人都没有眨眼。

Asuka's eyes finally closed and she focused all her efforts on bringing her lips up and down Shinji's now rock-hard cock as fast as she could, reaching almost every time the base of his shaft. Her right hand stroking his member each time her lips receded back up to the tip.  
明日香的眼睛终于闭上，她全神贯注地尽可能快速地上下移动双唇，几乎每次都能触及真嗣阴茎的根部。她的右手每次在她双唇退回到尖端时，都会抚摸他的阴茎。

Shinji's head began to roll back in response to the pleasure he felt but stopped as in the dark reflection on the television screen he could not only see himself and the back of Asuka's bobbing head but also her slit as her ass was stuck out. His eyes were mesmerized by the sight and it took all his self-control to not let his balls release at that moment.  
真嗣的头因感受到的快感而开始向后仰，但在电视屏幕的黑暗反射中，他不仅看到了自己和明日香摇晃的头部，还看到了她翘起的臀部间的缝隙。他的目光被这一景象深深吸引，竭尽全力才控制住自己不让精液在这一刻释放。

But whether by design or happenstance, Asuka picked that moment to bring her left hand from Shinji's thighs to his balls, fondling the wrinkly sack while her mouth continued its ministrations.  
但无论是精心设计还是偶然，明日香恰在此时将左手从真嗣的大腿移到他的睾丸上，轻轻抚摸着那皱褶的囊袋，而她的嘴则继续着她的动作。

Shinji couldn't take it anymore. His eyelids clamped shut as his hands went to Asuka's head and held it in place, his teeth grit in too much pleasure to give any kind of warning as spurt after spurt of hot cum shot into Asuka's mouth colliding with the inside of her left cheek before pooling around her teeth and tip of her tongue.  
真嗣再也忍受不住了。他的眼睑紧闭，双手伸向明日香的头部并固定住，因过于强烈的快感而紧咬牙关，无法发出任何警告，一股股滚烫的精液接连射入明日香的口中，撞击在她左颊内侧，随后汇聚在她的牙齿和舌尖周围。

Shinji absently felt Asuka's tongue, along with his recently deposited load, whirl around his cock, as she collected it all together before swallowing it down as Shinji's cockhead was still in her mouth before releasing it with a satisfying pop.  
真嗣心不在焉地感受到明日香的舌头，连同他刚刚注入的精华，在他的阴茎周围旋转，她将它们全部聚集起来，然后在真嗣的龟头还在她嘴里时将其吞下，随后满意地发出一声“啵”的声响。

Asuka brought a finger up to her lips to check and make sure there weren't any stray strands or drops or her lips, before noticing that Shinji was still rather zoned out and wanted to bring him back to reality as she crouched next to him.  
明日香用手指轻触嘴唇，检查确保没有遗漏的丝线或液滴，然后注意到真嗣仍然相当恍惚，她想让他回到现实，于是蹲在他旁边。

"You can take those back to the bed for me." Asuka whispered into his ear before the tip of her tongue went back and forth across his ear lobe. The sensation causing his legs and arms to quickly become covered in goosebumps.  
“你可以把这些拿回床上去。”明日香在他耳边低语，随后她的舌尖来回舔过他的耳垂。这种感觉让他的四肢迅速布满了鸡皮疙瘩。

"Yes…" Shinji responded quietly, his mind still heady from the ecstasy but his body responsive as he picked up the pile of clothes and took them to Asuka's room. He should have known this was Asuka's endgame, it was the only reason why she would have ever suggested something like strip-fighting game.  
“是的……” 真嗣轻声回应，尽管他的思绪仍沉浸在极乐之中，但身体已经本能地行动起来，拿起那堆衣物走向明日香的房间。他早该料到这是明日香的最终目的，这也是她提议玩脱衣格斗游戏的唯一理由。

His ears heard the tell-tale sound of Asuka falling onto the bed behind him as he placed the discarded clothes in Asuka's hamper.  
当他将散落的衣物放入明日香的衣篓时，耳朵捕捉到了明日香跌倒在床上的熟悉声响。

He looked behind him and could see Asuka lying face down on her bed, her body making a star as her limbs seemingly tried to reach all four corners.  
他回头望去，只见明日香面朝下躺在床上，身体呈星形，四肢仿佛在试图触及床的四角。

This inadvertently, or perhaps purposely, it was Asuka after all, gave Shinji another excellent view of that which had him so entranced before. That most private place, with the rosy pink lips just visible out of the creamy folds the same color of her pale thighs.  
这无意间，或许是故意的，毕竟这是明日香，给了真嗣又一次绝佳的视角，让他再次沉醉于之前那令他着迷的景象。那最私密的地方，玫瑰粉色的唇瓣从与她苍白大腿同色的奶油般褶皱中隐约可见。

Shinji looked down to his hand as it clenched and unclenched a few times as his mind worked out an idea. His little guy needed some time to recharge after all.  
真嗣低头看着自己的手，它紧握又松开几次，他的大脑在构思一个主意。毕竟，他的小家伙需要一些时间来重新充电。

So Shinji discarded the last of his own clothes onto Asuka's floor, and crawled onto the bed next to his redheaded lover. Her bright auburn locks flowing around her head like rays from the dawn peeking over mountains.  
于是真嗣脱掉了自己最后一件衣服，扔在明日香的地上，然后爬上床，躺在他红发爱人的旁边。她明亮的赤褐色头发如晨曦越过山巅般环绕着她的头部。

He rubbed his hands together quickly, the friction heating his hands before her placed them on the silky smooth skin of Asuka's back.  
他迅速搓了搓双手，摩擦生热后，将它们轻轻放在明日香光滑如丝的背上。

"Ohhh…right there…Shinji…" Asuka managed in a muffled, trailing voice as Shinji's hands found the spot in her lower back that always ached from a lifetime spent in an entry plug.  
“哦……就是那里……真嗣……” 明日香用一种含糊而拖长的声音勉强说道，真嗣的手正好找到了她下背部那个因一生都坐在插入栓里而总是酸痛的部位。

Shinji ran the open palms of his hands perpendicular to her spine just above her ass, the friction warming the skin and blood vessels beneath so they opened up and loosened her tense muscles in the process. His hands feeling as if they were on fire Shinji redirected his attention to Asuka's left ass cheek and the knot she always complained about, pressing the base of his palm into it to try and alleviate it.  
真嗣用掌心沿着她的脊柱平行移动，位置刚好在她臀部上方，摩擦使皮肤和血管下的血液升温，从而在过程中放松了她紧绷的肌肉。他的手感觉像着了火一样，真嗣将注意力转向明日香总是抱怨的那个左臀部的结，用掌根按压试图缓解它。

Afterwards his hands got their reward with each one grabbing an ass cheek and squeezing the firm yet supple flesh that flowed between his fingers as he moved his body so he was behind her and looking directly at her petals, glistening in the faint streaks of sunlight coming through the closed blinds.  
随后，他的双手得到了回报，各自抓住了一片臀瓣，挤压着那紧实而柔软的肉体，随着他移动身体，手指间流淌着细腻的触感，他来到了她的身后，直视着她那在闭合百叶窗透过的微弱阳光下闪耀的花瓣。

He wet his two musicians fingers with his tongue before placing them on her outer labia, playing with her external folds as he lowered his body so his face was next to hers.  
他用舌头湿润了两根音乐家般的手指，然后将它们放在她的外阴唇上，玩弄着她的外阴褶皱，同时降低身体，使自己的脸贴近她的脸庞。

The sight caused his heart to skip a beat. Her eyes, that piercing crystal azure, her mouth just barely parted as strands of her red hair streaked playfully across her whole face. They stared at one another in that intimate moment before smiles appeared on both their faces and their lips met, lightning coursing through each and goosebumps appearing on both their bare bodies before Shinji remembered his hand existed.  
这一幕让他的心跳漏了一拍。她的眼睛，那深邃的晶莹碧蓝，她的嘴微微张开，几缕红发调皮地横扫过她的整张脸。他们在那亲密的时刻凝视着彼此，随后两人的脸上都露出了微笑，双唇相触，电流般的感觉贯穿全身，鸡皮疙瘩在他们赤裸的身体上涌现，就在这时，真嗣想起了自己的手还存在。

He felt her breath hitch through the kiss as his first finger entered her, followed soon after by the second as they plied different paths in her warm, wrinkly insides, searching for that magic place he knew was there.  
他感觉到她的呼吸在亲吻中一滞，随着他的第一根手指进入她体内，紧接着第二根也很快加入，它们在她温暖、褶皱的深处探寻着不同的路径，寻找着他知道存在的那片神奇之地。

Asuka lifted up and rocked her hips a bit to help guide Shinji's digits deeper into her, while her tongue shot out from between her lips and quickly subdued Shinji's own and claiming his mouth as hers.  
明日香抬起身子，轻轻摇动臀部，帮助引导真嗣的手指更深入自己，同时她的舌头从唇间伸出，迅速制服了真嗣的舌头，将他的嘴据为己有。

Shinji felt her lower body twitch as he began curling his fingers inside her, as his ears heard her muffled moans and face felt the warm air of a breath Asuka had been holding. Before long his fingers felt her walls clamp down on his as her body shivered in his grasp and ragged breaths escaped Asuka's lips as the kiss ended and their foreheads rested against one another, Shinji on his side while Asuka remained lying with her frontside down as Shinji extracted his pruney fingers.  
真嗣感觉到她的下半身在他开始在她体内弯曲手指时微微颤抖，他的耳朵听到了她被压抑的呻吟，脸颊感受到了明日香一直屏住的温暖气息。不久，他的手指感觉到她的壁垒紧缩，她的身体在他怀中颤抖，粗重的呼吸从明日香的唇间逃逸。亲吻结束后，他们的额头相抵，真嗣侧躺着，而明日香仍俯卧着，真嗣抽出了他皱巴巴的手指。

The lovers shared another short kiss before Shinji got up and grabbed a pillow from the bed and Asuka raised her ass to accommodate, his intent as obvious as the boner that had been pressing against her thigh during his ministrations.  
恋人们再次短暂地亲吻了一下，随后真嗣起身从床上抓起一个枕头，而明日香则抬起臀部以适应，他的意图如同他之前在她大腿上按压的勃起一样明显。

Her rear propped up on the pillow, Shinji wet the tip of his cockhead with the juices that covered her lips. His member teasing the still sensitive petals before he lined it up at her entrance. Shinji heard an audible gasp come from Asuka as he entered her. The veins of his member disappearing into her as he put his entire length into her, giving Asuka that deep feeling of fullness she longed for.  
她的臀部垫在枕头上，真嗣用覆盖在她唇上的汁液湿润了龟头尖端。他的阴茎逗弄着她依然敏感的花瓣，然后对准她的入口。真嗣听到明日香发出一声明显的吸气声，当他进入她时。他的阴茎静脉消失在她体内，随着他将整个长度插入她，给了明日香那种她渴望已久的深沉充实感。

She propped herself up on her elbows and looked behind her to Shinji's face, eyes entreating. He brought his body down so it was laying atop her backside and their lips locked together as he began moving inside her walls.  
她用手肘撑起身体，回头看向真嗣的脸，眼神恳求。他俯身将身体压在她的背上，他们的唇紧紧相贴，随着他在她的体内移动。

His strokes were slow at first as both adjusted to the rhythm. Eventually the kiss broke and Asuka's teeth instead found the sheets of the bed, the fabric scrunching and wetted.  
起初，他的动作缓慢，两人都在适应这个节奏。最终，亲吻中断，明日香的双齿转而咬住了床单，布料被揉皱并沾湿。

She felt his hot breath against the back of her neck as his pace increased, the heat matched only by the inferno building in her belly. His thrusts seemingly touching every fold of her insides, every sensitive spot of her fleshy interior as a dark splotch began to build beneath their joined hips on the pillow beneath them.  
她感受到他炽热的呼吸拂过颈后，随着他的速度加快，这份热度仅能与她腹中逐渐升腾的烈焰相匹敌。他的每一次挺进似乎都触及了她体内的每一处褶皱，每一处敏感点，而在他们交合的臀部下方的枕头上，一块深色的印记开始形成。

Shinji felt his member seemingly glide in and out of Asuka's pussy, each thrust hilting himself into her before receding and his cockhead feeling her outer lips tickle that sensitive part where head met shaft before plunging back in again. His balls had nearly receded fully as they tightened against his body, and Shinji grunted and grit his teeth to last just a bit longer as he got that feeling that all men get when they are about to cum, that feeling words cannot describe when they know the next stroke or the one after it will be the last one before their balls will not be denied any longer.  
真嗣感觉到自己的阳具仿佛在明日香的阴部中滑进滑出，每一次挺进都深深地插入她体内，然后退缩，龟头感受到她的外阴轻触那敏感的部位，即头部与茎身相连之处，随后再次深入。他的睾丸几乎完全紧缩，紧贴着身体，真嗣咬紧牙关，低声咆哮，试图再坚持一会儿，因为他感受到了所有男人即将射精时的那种感觉，那种言语无法描述的感觉，他们知道下一击或再下一击将是最后一次，之后他们的睾丸将不再被拒绝。

With one final plunge into her deepest spot Shinji held his member there as his balls emptied into her. The feeling of his hot seed impacting her walls sending Asuka over the edge as her body shook and her teeth desperately bit down on the now drenched sheets to prevent her mouth from letting out a loud moan.  
随着最后一次深入她的最深处，真嗣将他的部位停留在那里，直到他的睾丸将精华倾泻入她体内。他滚烫的种子撞击着她的内壁，让明日香达到了高潮，她的身体颤抖着，牙齿紧紧咬住已经湿透的床单，以防口中发出响亮的呻吟。

Shinji gave a few gentle strokes before extracting his member from her but there was simply too much for it all to stay in her and it began to flow out. The cum was dripping out of her pussy, sending a second wave of pleasure to shudder through her body as it passed over her clit, before down her belly to drip onto the pillow beneath her.  
真嗣轻轻抽动了几下，然后从她体内抽出，但那里的液体实在太多，无法全部留在她体内，开始流出。精液从她的私处滴落，带来第二波快感，让她全身颤抖，经过她的阴蒂，顺着腹部滴落到她身下的枕头上。

Shinji, his manhood spent, lay down next to his German lover, a hand stroking her cheek as her teeth released their grip on the bedspread and her hands removed the pillow from underneath her, tossing it to the side of the bed to be cleaned later. Asuka then nuzzled her face into Shinji's chest, wetting and warming it by the condensation of her hot breath, while the brown haired boy's arms wrapped around her in a tight post-coital embrace.  
真嗣，精力耗尽，躺在他的德国恋人旁边，一只手抚摸着她的脸颊，她的牙齿松开了对床单的咬合，双手将枕头从身下移开，扔到床边待会儿再清洗。明日香随后将脸埋进真嗣的胸膛，用她热呼呼的呼吸湿润并温暖着那里，而棕发少年的双臂紧紧环绕着她，给予了一个亲密无间的拥抱。

"Is Misato coming home tonight?" Asuka asked in a quiet voice after some time.  
"美里今晚回家吗？" 过了一会儿，明日香轻声问道。

"I think so." Shinji said after a pause to try and remember the NERV Major's schedule.  
"我想是的。" 真嗣停顿了一下，试图回忆 NERV 的葛城美里少校的日程。

"_Verdammt_." Asuka cursed in her native tongue before continuing. "I really wanted you to be with me."  
"该死。" 明日香用她的母语咒骂了一句，然后继续说道。"我真的希望你能陪我。"

"I'm here now." "我现在在这里。"

"Then we better make the most of it."  
"那我们最好充分利用它。"

**NERV Geofront: That same time  
NERV 地底都市：同一时刻**

Misato Katsuragi, NERV's Operations Director sat at the terminal in the relatively cramped office for someone of her rank. She was trying not to fall asleep as she looked at the accounting department's report that basically said the UN needed to print more money. Well, get its members to print more money, but still.  
NERV 的作战部长葛城美里坐在她那相对狭小的办公室终端前，努力不让自己睡着。她正看着会计部门的报告，内容大致是说联合国需要印更多的钱。好吧，让成员国印更多的钱，但本质上还是一样的。

Then just as her eyelids had nearly closed the spreadsheets of numbers and figures vanished, replaced by a text box with a single sentence written in it:  
就在她的眼皮几乎要合上时，那些数字和图表的电子表格突然消失了，取而代之的是一个文本框，里面只有一句话：

**The gift I left needs to be used soon.  
我留下的礼物需要尽快使用。**

Misato darted up, and quickly looked to check that the door to her office was closed and there were no prying eyes before she typed out a response.  
美里迅速起身，迅速查看确保办公室的门已关闭，没有窥探的目光后，才开始键入回复。

**You damn fool. What if someone was here?  
你这个蠢货。万一有人在这里怎么办？**

**But they aren't. 但他们不在。**

Misato audibly sighed before continuing the conversation, hoping that the person on the other side would understand.  
美里明显地叹了口气，然后继续对话，希望对方能理解。

**And your end?** Her fingers spelt out on the screen hoping he'd found something.  
那你的发现呢？她的手指在屏幕上比划着，希望他能找到些什么。

**Some interesting threads, but nothing concrete.** The NERV Major's hopes were dashed by pixels on a screen before more words appeared.  
有些有趣的线索，但没什么实质性的。NERV 少校的希望被屏幕上的像素击碎，随后更多的文字出现了。

**Time is running out, we need answers to find the truth, to stop what's coming.  
时间紧迫，我们需要答案来揭示真相，阻止即将到来的灾难。**

**Several Days Later: The Eva Cages  
数日后：Eva 拘束笼**

"The target is rotating in a fixed position above the Owakudani Valley." Major Katsuragi began as she briefed them on the latest Angel to arrive in Tokyo-3 "Unit-00 will sortie through the 32nd gate, Units 01 and 02 remain on standby."  
“目标正固定在大涌谷上空旋转。”葛城美里少校开始向他们简报最新抵达第三新东京市的使徒情况，“零号机会通过第 32 号门出击，初号机和二号机保持待命状态。”

The Second and Third Children sighed at nearly the exact moment at being held back again. They should have been used to it by now. Out of boredom the German redhead began flicking through the tactical and operational data NERV had.  
第二和第三适格者几乎在同一时刻叹了口气，再次被阻止行动。他们本该对此习以为常了。出于无聊，德国的红发少女开始翻阅 NERV 提供的战术和作战数据。

"It's shifting between blue and orange? What does this mean?" Asuka asked herself as she looked through the MAGI's data transmitted to her entry plug.  
“它在蓝色和橙色之间切换？这意味着什么？”明日香自言自语，同时查看着 MAGI 传输到她插入栓的数据。

"Looks like they're keeping Rei back until they find out." Shinji said as an audio-visual screen appeared and Asuka realized she'd said that last question aloud with the comm link still open. She really needed to be more careful with that.  
“看来他们要等到查明情况后才会让绫波出动。”真嗣说道，一个音视频屏幕出现，明日香意识到自己刚才那句话是通过通讯链接说出来的。她真的需要在这方面更加小心。

"Well duh, baka!" Asuka said, her tone temperamental and false, while inside she felt a knot of dread build in her belly.  
"哎呀，笨蛋！" 明日香说道，语气中带着矫情和烦躁，内心却感到一阵恐惧在腹中凝聚。

She didn't really know that much about her teammate, not that the First Child made that task easy. Especially after the last battle with the 15th Angel, where the blue-haired girl had managed to become even more withdrawn, and miss more school.  
她其实并不太了解她的队友，这也不怪初号机驾驶员让这项任务变得困难。尤其是在与第 15 使徒的最后一战之后，蓝发女孩变得更加孤僻，也缺课更多了。

"_Why did we get stuck with this?" Asuka asked Shinji as she flipped over the printouts from school in her hand._  
"我们怎么摊上这事儿了？" 明日香一边问着真嗣，一边翻看着手中的学校打印资料。

"_Well they can only assign two students to the duty, I guess it makes sense to assign the boy and a girl who are also Eva pilots." Shinji said as they walked down the street towards the Neo-Ayanami apartment._  
"嗯，他们只能指派两名学生执行这项任务，我想指派一个男孩和一个女孩，他们同时也是 EVA 驾驶员，这很合理。" 真嗣说着，他们沿着街道走向新绫波公寓。

"_Jock-stooge is also a pilot!"_  
"那个体育生也是驾驶员！"

"_Would you rather he was here than me?" He asked as he turned his head to look at her face._  
"你宁愿他在这里而不是我吗？" 他问道，同时转过头去看她的脸。

"_Gott,_ _**nein,**__" Asuka loudly proclaimed, revulsion clear in her voice for any eavesdroppers before adding in a hushed tone, "Plus I think Hikari had her hand in the assignments anyway. She's paired with the Fourth today for cleaning duty."_  
"天哪，不，" 明日香大声宣称，声音中明显的厌恶之情让任何偷听者都能感受到，随后她压低声音补充道，"而且我觉得分配任务的事八成是光子搞的鬼。她今天和第四小队一起负责清洁工作。"

"_Wonder if they're having as much fun as we did." Shinji whispered back, earning an elbow in the ribs._  
"不知道他们是不是也像我们那样玩得开心。" 真嗣低声回应，结果被肘击了一下肋骨。"

"_Dummkopf." Asuka hissed through clenched teeth even as her face reddened at the memory._  
"笨蛋。" 明日香咬牙切齿地低声骂道，尽管她的脸颊因回忆而泛起了红晕。"

"_Plus weren't you worried about her?" Shinji said recovering quickly, not even apologizing this time._  
“而且你不是担心她吗？”真嗣迅速恢复过来，这次甚至没有道歉。

"_Yeah…" Asuka sighed as they got in the elevator to go to Rei's floor. The progress they had made earlier in getting close to Rei had turned to ash. She barely even muttered a pleasantry when they were in the locker room for sync training anymore, whereas before she'd always said an albeit muted greeting or goodbye._  
“是啊……”他们进入电梯前往绫波的楼层时，明日香叹了口气。之前他们与绫波拉近关系的进展已化为灰烬。现在她在更衣室进行同步训练时几乎连一句客套话都不说了，而以前她总会用尽管微弱的声音打招呼或道别。

_Shinji's finger depressed the doorbell and the couple waited for their colleague to appear.  
真嗣按下门铃，这对情侣等待着他们的同事出现。_

_After a few moments a Rei, dressed in a school uniform despite not going to school, appeared in the open doorway.  
片刻后，穿着校服的绫波零出现在敞开的门口，尽管她并不上学。_

"_Hi Wondergirl" Asuka began "We brought you these printouts." She said as she handed the leaves of cheaply printed tasks._  
“嗨，奇迹少女。”明日香开口道，“我们给你带来了这些打印件。”她一边说，一边递过几页廉价打印的任务清单。

"_Are you okay Ayanami?" Shinji asked when it became clear the First Child wasn't going to say thank you, hoping to get something out of her._  
“你还好吗，绫波？”真嗣问道，当发现第一适格者没有道谢时，他希望从她那里得到些回应。

"_I am functional." Rei gave a noncommittal answer that didn't help the perception she acted like a doll as the door hiss closed._  
"我是有功能的。" 绫波给出了一个模棱两可的回答，这无助于改变她像玩偶一样行动的印象，随着门嘶的一声关闭。

Asuka's reminisces were interrupted though by Rei's quiet voice coming over the comms:  
然而，明日香的回忆被绫波通过通讯器传来的平静声音打断了：

"No, it's coming." "不，它来了。"

What followed was sheer pandemonium as every klaxon blared at once as the blood pattern ceased switching became fully blue and the MAGI confirmed the 16th Angel had arrived.  
接下来是一片混乱，所有警报器同时响起，血液模式停止切换，完全变为蓝色，MAGI 确认了第 16 使徒的到来。

The rotating helix suddenly paused and the twisting bands of light seemed to merge together before separating and hurtling toward Unit-00, impacting the Eva's abdomen before Rei could react.  
旋转的螺旋突然停顿，扭曲的光带似乎融合在一起，然后分开，朝着零号机疾驰而去，撞击在绫波零反应过来之前击中了 EVA 的腹部。

Rei gritted her teeth and grabbing the strand that had embedded itself in her, positioned it directly at the barrel of her sniper rifle and fired three point blank shots in rapid succession.  
绫波咬紧牙关，抓住嵌入自己体内的那根光带，将其对准狙击枪的枪管，连续快速地开了三枪。

Each one of the tungsten alloy rounds ricocheted off the surprising tough hide of the 16th Angel with an audible ping before Unit-00's grip around its weapon failed and Rei's consciousness felt a presence bursting through her mental barriers, demanding that it be heard.  
每一颗钨合金弹头都以清晰的叮当声从第 16 使徒那出乎意料坚韧的外皮上弹开，随后零号机的握力失效，绫波的意识中感受到一股力量冲破她的精神屏障，迫切要求被听见。

"Who is this?" Rei said as she felt a presence in her mind, manifesting as a version of herself standing almost waist deep in a pool of strange liquid.  
“你是谁？”绫波说道，她感觉到一个存在在她的脑海中，以一个几乎腰深浸在奇怪液体中的自己形象显现。

"_**Don't you want to become one with me?"**_  
“难道你不想与我合为一体吗？”

"No I am me not you." Rei said in response to the 16th Angel, Armisael's question.  
“不，我就是我，不是你。” 绫波零对第 16 使徒阿米沙尔的问题如此回应道。

"_**But you shall it's too late."**_  
“但你会的，已经太迟了。”

Meanwhile in Central Dogma the mayhem had not subsided.  
与此同时，中央教条区的混乱并未平息。

"More than five percent of Unit-00 has already undergone bio-fusion!" Lieutenant Ibuki yelled across Central Dogma as her work station was covered in blinking red lights that spoke of the danger Rei was in. Her Eva convulsing as tendrils of corruption spread out from the impact point.  
"零号机已有超过百分之五的部分发生了生物融合！" 伊吹摩耶中尉在中央教条区大喊，她的工作站被闪烁的红灯覆盖，警示着绫波的危险处境。她的 Eva 因腐败的触须从撞击点蔓延而抽搐着。

"Commander, we need to launch!" Major Katsuragi said as she turned to look at the imposing figure of Gendo Ikari, has face still hidden behind glaring glasses and steepled hands as he responded:  
"指挥官，我们必须立即发射！" 葛城美里少校转向看着冷峻的碇源堂，他的脸依旧隐藏在刺眼的镜片和交叠的双手之后，回应道：

"Send out Unit-02 as support."  
"派出二号机作为支援。"

"But sir, we should send out both our remain-"  
"但先生，我们应该派出我们剩下的——"

"No arguments! I said launch Major!" Gendo cut off the Major's protest, his voice rising but his body never moving.  
"没有争论！我说了发射‘大佐’！" 源渡打断了大佐的抗议，他的声音提高但身体始终未动。

"Yes, sir." Misato ground out through grit teeth. "Asuka! Launch!"  
"是，先生。" 美里咬牙切齿地说道，"明日香！发射！"

"Unit-02, launching!" Asuka Langley Sohryu said as she felt the catapult lift her Eva up through the labyrinthine tunnels that connected Geofront and surface.  
“二号机，发射！”惣流·明日香·兰格雷说道，她感受到弹射器将她的 EVA 从连接地底都市与地表的错综复杂的隧道中抬起。

Asuka seeing how ineffective Rei's rifle had been on Armisael had opted to take the spear she had used in her first round with Israfel, thinking its long reach would prove useful in these battle conditions.  
看到零的步枪对亚米沙尔效果不佳，明日香决定拿起她在与伊斯拉斐尔第一轮战斗中使用的长矛，认为其长距离攻击在这种战斗条件下会很有用。

Unit-02 finally reached the surface, exiting from the lift and finding its footing quickly before Asuka let out a battle cry and charged in:  
二号机终于到达地表，从升降机中出来并迅速站稳脚跟，随后明日香发出战斗的呐喊，冲向前去：

"Get off her!" Asuka screamed as she commanded her Eva forward, the other end of the gold strand bifurcating in two and seemingly readying itself to ward off this new intruder while it consumed Unit-00.  
“放开她！”明日香尖叫着命令她的 Eva 前进，金色丝线的另一端一分为二，似乎准备就绪，要抵御这个新闯入者，同时吞噬零号机。

The two strands launched themselves at the red Eva, but Asuka was faster and sidestepped their attack, countering with a swipe of her own spear, the blade catching one of the strands, definitely cutting it by the sympathetic feeling of resistance in her hands.  
两条丝线向红色 Eva 发起攻击，但明日香更快，她侧身避开攻击，反手用长矛一挥，刀刃抓住其中一条丝线，通过手中感受到的阻力，确定将其切断。

Asuka heard Rei let out a scream, providing impetus for her to kill this Angel as fast as possible and save her comrade.  
明日香听到绫波发出一声尖叫，这促使她尽快消灭这个使徒，拯救她的战友。

'Hold on Wondergirl' Asuka thought. But with her mind momentarily on Rei and not the fight in front of her Armisael used this chance to strike, one of its tendrils looping around her side and aiming directly for the four-eyed maw of Unit-02. A last minute warning from Shinji over comms saved her and she put up her left hand, palm out to stop it.  
“坚持住，奇迹少女。”明日香心想。但她的注意力一时被绫波分散，未能专注于眼前的战斗，阿米莎尔趁机发动攻击，一条触手缠绕在她身侧，直指二号机的四眼巨口。幸亏真嗣通过通讯设备及时发出警告，她才伸出左手，掌心向外挡住了攻击。

What followed was searing pain coursing through Asuka's entire body as Armisael penetrated her hand, through pain-teared eyes, she could just see a faint gold wisp on the back of her Unit's hand. She looked at her own hand in the cockpit and saw what she hoped were sympathetic veins of corruption spreading outward from the impact point on her plugsuit.  
紧接着，剧烈的疼痛席卷了明日香全身，阿米莎尔穿透了她的手掌，透过泪眼模糊的视线，她隐约看到二号机手背上有一缕淡金色的微光。她看向驾驶舱内的自己的手，发现插座服上从撞击点向外扩散的，她希望只是同情的腐败静脉。

"Get **OUT!**" Asuka roared as rage, greater than any she had ever known, filled her. Her sync rate spiked as her Eva scraped together every bit of power it could draw from its S2 engine and funneled it into a burst of her AT field. The invading tendril was sent reeling as it was expelled from Unit-02.  
“滚出去！”明日香咆哮着，愤怒超越了她以往所知的任何程度。同步率飙升，她的 EVA 从 S2 引擎中汲取每一丝能量，将其汇聚成 AT 力场的一记爆发。入侵的触手被震退，从二号机中弹射而出。

"Oh no you don't!" Asuka said as she brought her foot down on the retreating band of light, holding the squirming thing down while both her hands plunged her spear down into it. Another scream came from Rei, the First Child letting out more wails as Asuka twisted the spear in the wound she had made before abruptly letting it go and activating her comms.  
"想得美！" 明日香说着，一脚踩在退缩的光带上，将那扭动的东西牢牢按住，双手则将长矛猛地刺入其中。另一声尖叫从丽口中传出，第一适格者发出更多哀嚎，明日香在伤口中扭动长矛，随后突然松手，激活了通讯设备。

"Is this thing bonding with Rei!?" Asuka said, her mind managing to put two and two together. "Every time I hit it she cries out!"  
"这东西是不是和丽结合了！？" 明日香说道，她的思维终于将两件事联系起来。"每次我击中它，她都会尖叫！"

"Given the state of bio-fusion and this Angel's capabilities its likely any damage inflicted on it is being psychosomatically felt by Pilot Ayanami!" Dr Akagi answered.  
"考虑到生物融合的状态和这使徒的能力，很可能对它的任何伤害都会通过心理作用让绫波零感受到！" 赤木博士回答道。

"How are we supposed to beat it then!" Asuka asked the faux blonde doctor as she parried another strike from the Angel's golden fronds.  
“那我们该怎么打败它！”明日香向那位金发假医生问道，同时挡开了使徒金色触须的又一次攻击。

"Try and get closer. Combining your AT field with Rei's might eject the Angel from Unit-00!" Major Katsuragi said, thinking quickly.  
“试着靠近些。结合你和绫波的 AT 力场，或许能把使徒从零号机中驱逐出去！”葛城美里少校迅速思考后说道。

"Roger!" Asuka said as her Eva took a step forward, readying her body for a dash to where Unit-00 lay, back against a hill. The two golden tendrils of Armisael swaying like dancing cobra heads, ready to strike into the flesh of her Eva, ready to spread the rank corruption that defied its noble, golden appearance.  
“收到！”明日香回应道，她的 EVA 向前迈出一步，准备冲向倚靠在山坡上的零号机。阿米沙尔的两根金色触须如同舞动的眼镜蛇头般摇摆，随时准备刺入她的 EVA，散布那与其高贵金色外表相悖的腐化之物。

"_**Oh!? You do know anger."**_  
"哦！？你确实懂得愤怒。"

Rei heard the voice as she managed to look at the closing red of Unit-02, trying to sprint towards her downed form, only to be stopped by a golden tendril coming behind and piercing the Eva's right shoulder before Asuka could focus her AT field to force it from her body and bash the intruder away with the end of her spear.  
零听到声音时，正努力望向正关闭的二号机红色身影，试图向她倒下的身躯冲刺，却被一根金色触手从后方袭来，刺穿了 EVA 的右肩，阿斯卡才刚集中 AT 力场试图将其从身体中逼出，并用长矛末端猛击入侵者。

"She's… She's trying to save me?" Rei said to the empty entry plug as she watched Asuka fight her absolute hardest to get to her, the certainty of that coming from the latent connection between their souls from when Armisael had punctured the both of them. "Would I do the same?" She asked herself as she looked at her hands, covered in the twisting, swollen, corruption that was eating through her body and soul.  
""她……她想救我？" 零对着空荡的插入栓喃喃自语，看着明日香竭尽全力想要接近她，这份确信源自阿米沙尔刺穿她们两人时灵魂间潜藏的联系。"我会这样做吗？" 她看着双手，那扭曲、肿胀、腐败的侵蚀正吞噬着她的身体和灵魂，自问道。

"_**AHH!"**_  "啊！"

Arimsael let out in her mind with what had to be excited glee before continuing:  
阿里姆赛尔在心中发出必定是兴奋至极的欢呼，然后继续道：

"_**This is a new one. One you've never felt before."**_  
"这可是个新体验。你以前从未感受过的。"

Since the 16th Angel had begun fusing itself with Unit-00 it had been unleashing emotional torment upon the pilot. Forcing negative feelings of loneliness, despair, and pain among others into her mind. But what Rei felt now was different than all those others and came from within herself rather than from the outside. Armisael let out a sickening chuckle before it gave a name to what the First Child was feeling just as the first tear fell from her eyes:  
自从第 16 使徒开始与零号机融合以来，它便不断向驾驶员施加情感折磨，迫使她感受到孤独、绝望和痛苦等负面情绪。但此刻绫波感受到的与之前的都不同，这种感觉源自内心而非外界。亚尔米萨尔发出令人作呕的轻笑，就在第一滴泪水从她眼角滑落之际，它为这位第一适格者此刻的感受命名：

"_**Guilt."**_ “愧疚。”

'This is bad.' Asuka thought as she looked at the writhing form of Unit-00, still hundreds of meters away. It was all she could do to hold her own against Armisael's attacks, let alone beat the wickedly fast golden tendrils away long enough to get to Rei.  
“这下糟了。”明日香望着数百米外仍在扭动的零号机形态，心中暗想。她只能勉强抵挡亚尔米萨尔的攻击，更别提要击退那些邪恶而迅捷的金色触须，以便接近绫波。

"Bio-fusion approaching critical levels!" Maya said over the radio from Central Dogma to drive home the point that they were running out of time.  
"生物融合接近临界水平！" 玛雅通过中央 dogma 的无线电强调他们时间紧迫。

"I can't break through! I need support or Rei will die!" Asuka said as she side stepped another attack, getting another step closer to Unit-00 only to be forced back another two by the 16th Angel's renewed drive. The ankles of her red mech digging into asphalt and earth as the tendrils pushed against her AT field and spear shaft.  
"我无法突破！我需要支援，否则丽会死！" 明日香一边侧身躲避又一次攻击，一边说道，她向零号机靠近了一步，却又被第 16 使徒的猛烈攻势逼退了两步。她的红色机体脚踝陷入沥青和泥土中，使徒的触手在她的 AT 力场和长矛杆上施加压力。

A hush fell over Central Dogma at the Second Child's pronouncement. All eyes turned to Gendo, though only he knew the wheels turning in his head. On the one hand he would be risking Unit-01, risking Yui. He had backups of the First, but those were empty shells, and still so much was unknown about metaphysical biology and the aspects of Ayanami's unique physiology. There was no telling what prolonged contamination might do to her soul, and more importantly her ability to perform his desired scenario. Not to mention that once this Angel was finished with Unit-00, it would turn its full attention to Unit-02 and likely absorb it as well, leaving only Unit-01 and his scenario in jeopardy no matter what. His decision made, the NERV Supreme Commander spoke:  
中央教条区在二号机驾驶员的宣告下陷入一片寂静。所有目光转向了源堂，尽管只有他知晓自己脑海中正在转动的念头。一方面，他将冒着风险使用零号机，冒着风险涉及唯。他虽有初号机的备份，但那些只是空壳，而对绫波独特生理学的超自然生物学方面仍知之甚少。无法预知长时间的污染会对她的灵魂，更关键的是对她执行他期望场景的能力造成何种影响。更不用说，一旦这个使徒处理完零号机后，它会将全部注意力转向二号机，并很可能将其吸收，无论怎样，最终只剩下初号机和他的计划处于危险之中。做出决定后，NERV 最高指挥官开口道：

"Sortie Unit-01." “出动初号机。”

"You hear that Asuka! Hold back until Unit-01 arrives, then both of you break through and get to Rei!"  
“你听到了吗，明日香！在初号机到达之前保持克制，然后你们俩一起突破并去救绫波！”

"Understood!" Shinji and Asuka replied in unison to their commanding officer as the catapult system shot Shinji to the surface. There he immediately discarded his pallet rifle, it likely being useless against this angel, not to mention Rei would be in the line of fire for any stray or ricocheting shots, and he pulled out his progressive knife.  
“明白！”真嗣和明日香齐声回应指挥官，随即弹射系统将真嗣送至水面。一到那里，他立刻丢弃了手中的板条箱步枪，面对这个使徒，那显然毫无用处，更别提零号机也会处于流弹或跳弹的威胁之下，于是他拔出了高频振动刀。

"You go left, I'll go right." Asuka said, no teasing or games this time, not with these stakes. The Evas lunged forward only to be stopped by the twin tendrils of Armisael colliding at full force into their AT fields, the orange octagons visibly cracking under the stress before the golden strands retreated, only to circle back around and try again from another angle. This time piercing Unit-01's AT Field with Shinji only narrowly dodging the strike as Asuka hit it away with the end of her spear. Three steps forward, two steps back. They were clawing their way forward, but it wasn't anywhere near fast enough.  
“你走左边，我走右边。”明日香说道，这次没有戏谑或游戏，面对这样的风险，不容儿戏。两台 EVA 猛冲向前，却被阿米沙尔的双重触手以全力撞击在 AT 力场上，橙色的八角形明显在压力下裂开，金色触手退缩后，又从另一个角度回旋再试，这次刺穿了零一号机的 AT 力场，真嗣仅以毫厘之差躲过攻击，而明日香则用矛尾将其击开。三步前进，两步后退。他们在艰难地向前推进，但速度远远不够。

Rei was curled in a ball in her entry plug, her plugsuit covered in the snaking corruption of Armisael as it tried to make her one with him, as if forcing a union would fill the aching loneliness of the Angel with no core. Her mind roiled in all the emotions that had been unleashed upon it as it contemplated her actions and own existence.  
丽蜷缩在她的插入栓内，紧身衣上布满了阿米沙尔的扭曲侵蚀，它试图让她与他融为一体，仿佛这种强制结合能填补这个无核使徒的孤独痛苦。她的思绪在所有被释放的情感中翻腾，思考着自己的行为和存在。

Still she managed to look up and see a purple and red behemoth battling, trying to inch closer to her.  
尽管如此，她还是设法抬头望去，看到一个紫红色的巨兽正在战斗，试图向她靠近。

"Ikari." Rei verbalized as she saw Shinji and Asuka moving in perfect sync, covering each other from the dangerous touch of Armisael, the two uniting their AT fields into one. She could see the energies of their souls blending perfectly to forcefully eject a tendril that had pierced Unit-01's shin.  
“碇。”丽看到真嗣和明日香动作完美同步，互相掩护，躲避阿米沙尔的危险触碰，两人将 AT 力场合二为一。她能看到他们灵魂的能量完美融合，强行将刺穿初号机小腿的触手弹开。

"_**They aren't lonely don't you want to be like them?"**_  
"他们并不孤单，难道你不想变得像他们一样吗？"

Rei grimaced as the voice returned, bringing new torments with it.  
当那个声音再次响起，带来新的折磨时，丽皱起了眉头。

"_**No, you want to be one with them."**_  
"不，你渴望与他们融为一体。"

Rei managed to open her eyes just in time to see Unit-01 barely avoid being struck by another of Armisael's golden tentacles. Shinji batting the offending strand with the flat of his knife to try and avoid damage to his fellow pilot, while Rei only just now noticed the spear tip was missing from Asuka's weapon, stuck in a parking lot along with part of the shaft she had broken off.  
零勉强睁开眼睛，正好看到初号机险险避开阿米沙尔的另一根金色触手。真嗣用刀背击打那根惹事的触须，试图避免对同伴驾驶员造成伤害，而零直到此刻才注意到明日香的武器尖端不见了，插在停车场里，连同她折断的部分矛杆。

"_**Well just wait a little longer and you shall."**_  
“那就再等一会儿，你很快就会明白了。”

"No." Rei said weakly as she gathered what strength she had and set her AT field to maximum while also reversing it, drawing the Angel fully into Unit-00, causing its cloned flesh to bulge and armor to shatter at the speed and scale of the contamination taking place. Her ears were filled with pleas and cries for clarity from Central Dogma, but only one voice stood out:  
“不。”零虚弱地说道，她集中仅存的力量，将 AT 力场调至最大并反向施展，将使徒完全吸入零号机体内，导致其复制肉体膨胀，装甲在污染的速度和规模下破碎。她的耳中充满了中央教条的请求和呼喊，但只有一个声音脱颖而出：

"Now's our chance!" She faintly heard over the radio as she shuffled around, using more her arms than her legs to try and reach the back of the entry plug's seat, and the final failsafe that lay there.  
“现在是我们动手的机会！”她隐约听到无线电里传来声音，同时她用双臂而非双腿努力挪动，试图触及插入栓座椅的后部，那里藏着最后的自毁装置。

She released the safety latch, her hands tightening around firing handle ready to plunge it down. Her mind weakly thought she should say something as she stood on the edge of oblivion, but she just didn't have the strength.  
她松开安全锁，双手紧握发射手柄准备按下。她的意识微弱地提醒自己应该说些什么，站在虚无的边缘，但她已无力开口。

But before she could shift her body wight to depress the firing stud, her arms were too weak now to do it on their own, she felt another presence, actually two other presences there with her. The feeling gave her a renewed sense of strength and releasing her grip on the self-destruct she unfurled her own AT field, purging Armisael's grip from her body as it was weakened by two other S2 powered AT fields at point blank range.  
但在她调整身体重心按下发射按钮之前，她的双臂已无力独自完成这一动作。此时，她感觉到另外两个存在的气息。这种感觉赋予了她新的力量，她松开自毁装置，展开自己的 AT 力场，在两个近距离 S2 引擎驱动的 AT 力场削弱下，将阿米沙尔的控制从体内清除。

The golden, stringy, body of the 16th Angel flew across the valley as it was denied the union it so desperately wanted as the red and purple bodies of Units-01 and 02 put themselves between Rei's prone Eva and the enemy.  
第十六使徒那金色的、细长的身躯在峡谷中飞掠，它渴望的融合被无情拒绝，赤红与紫色的初号机和零号机挺身而出，挡在了绫波的倒地 EVA 与敌人之间。

"We've got it from here Ayanami!" Rei heard Shinji over the radio as she saw the wrinkles on her plugsuit melt away now that the corrupting touch of the Angel had been broken.  
“这里交给我们了，绫波！”绫波通过无线电听到真嗣的声音，她看到自己的驾驶服上的皱褶随着使徒邪恶触碰的解除而消失。

"We need to find the core!" Asuka said as she scanned Armisael's form, oscillating with what seemed to be anger above a nearby hill.  
“我们必须找到核心！”明日香说道，她审视着亚米沙尔的形态，似乎带着怒意在附近的山丘上波动。

"I don't see one!" Shinji said, the usually ubiquitous glowing red orb absent on this particular angel.  
"我一个也没看到！" 真嗣说道，通常无处不在的闪亮红球在这只使徒身上缺席了。

"Wait! They're a helix aren't they!?" Asuka said, her mind replaying the video feed she'd seen of their Eva's consuming Leliel's two S2 organs. She suppressed a shudder at the thought of their bloodied mechs' blocky teeth tearing into the helix-shaped tissues.  
"等等！它们是螺旋形的，对吧！？" 明日香说道，她的脑海中回放着他们 EVA 吞噬雷里尔两个 S2 机关的视频。想到他们血迹斑斑的机甲那方块般的牙齿撕扯着螺旋形组织，她不禁打了个寒颤。

"Yeah?" Shinji said, his questioning tone telling the German redhead he didn't know where she was going with this.  
"是吗？" 真嗣问道，他那疑惑的语气告诉这位德国红发少女，他并不明白她想表达什么。

"Don't you get it baka!? It's entire body is its core!" Asuka said, demonstrating why she was called a prodigy.  
"你这个笨蛋还不明白吗？！它的整个身体就是核心！" 明日香说道，展示了她为何被称为天才的原因。

"Damn!" Shinji cursed in realization before asking the next obvious question "How do we kill it then!"  
"该死！" 真嗣咒骂一声，随即意识到并问道 "那我们该怎么杀死它！"

Asuka looked at the Angel, if it had been an animal, or even just had limbs she'd have said it was pacing back and forth, waiting to pounce. She adjusted her grip on her spear as an idea popped into her head:  
明日香看着使徒，如果它是一只动物，或者哪怕只是有四肢，她会说它正在来回踱步，等待扑击的机会。她调整了一下手中的长矛，一个主意突然闪现在脑海中：

"When I say run, go!"  
“我说跑，就快跑！”

Rather than ask a question Shinji merely nodded through their audio-visual channel and readied his grip on his progressive knife.  
真嗣没有多问，只是通过音视频通道点了点头，并紧握住手中的高频刀做好了准备。

Finally, the twin tendrils of one of the halo's ends rushed towards the two Evas. One gold tendril whipped around the shaft of Asuka's spear, while the other around Shinji's blade. But, rather than deflecting them away or cutting into the Angel's body, they instead grabbed hold of each golden end, not letting it retreat while their AT fields held the corrupting influence at bay.  
终于，光环的一端射出两道细长的光束，直奔两台 EVA 而来。一道金色的光束缠绕在明日香的长矛上，另一道则缠绕在真嗣的刀刃上。然而，它们并没有将武器弹开或切入使徒的身体，而是紧紧抓住了金色的末端，不让它们退缩，同时 AT 力场将那股腐蚀性的影响阻挡在外。

"Run!" Asuka screamed into the radio, her feet already moving.  
“快跑！”明日香对着无线电尖叫，她的双脚已经动了起来。

Shinji understood the gist of her plan and went in the opposite direction. Their movements unfurling the structure of the Angel. Until it came down to the last connection at the end that had violated Unit-00. Both Asuka and Shinji were straining to keep going, they'd long since reached the edges of the valley and were now moving up mountains on either side.  
真嗣大致明白了她的计划，朝相反方向跑去。他们的动作展开了使徒的结构，直到最后触及侵犯零号机的连接点。明日香和真嗣都在竭力坚持，他们早已到达山谷的边缘，现在正分别在两侧的山上攀登。

As they neared the tops on either side, they each turned their Evas around and looked back.  
当他们接近两侧山顶时，各自转身面向 EVA，回头望去。

"On three." Shinji said thinking quickly before counting up.  
“三二一。” 真嗣迅速思考后开始倒数。

At the mark both pilots used what remained of their strength and jumped to the other side of their respective mountain, letting gravity do the rest.  
在标记处，两位驾驶员利用剩余的力量跳到各自山峰的另一侧，任由重力完成剩下的工作。

The tension was too much for Armisael the 16th Angel and the last connection between its twin strands broke. The previously dazzling twists were no more as it died with a whimper and its body turned to ash that blew away in the wind, as if the Angel had never really been there.  
对于第 16 使徒亚米沙来说，紧张感过于强烈，它与双股之间的最后一丝联系断裂了。曾经耀眼的螺旋不再，它在呜咽中消亡，身体化为灰烬随风飘散，仿佛这个使徒从未真正存在过。

Well almost, the twisted mutated form of Unit-00 remained as a testament to its existence.  
几乎如此，变异扭曲的零号机形态依旧作为其存在的证明。

**Gendo's Esoteric Office: Later that week  
碇源堂的隐秘办公室：一周后**

"Pilot Sohryu." Gendo Ikari began, hands in their usual position as his eyes gleaned the nature of the contents of the folders before him. "You're here to lodge a formal complaint?"  
“碇司令。”碇源堂开口道，双手一如既往地交叠，目光扫过面前文件夹中的内容。“你来此是为了正式提出投诉吗？”

"Sir." Asuka began as she stood at attention the prescribed twenty meters away from Gendo seated at his desk with the Vice Commander standing to his side. "Our tactics the last several engagements have been nothing short of disastrous. We keep sending our forces in piecemeal, resulting in unnecessary damage and needless casualties. These forms formally protest these tactics and propose Units-01 and 02 be designated as the Vanguard rather than Unit-00." Asuka said, stating the main idea contained in the documents.  
“长官。”明日香开始报告，她按照规定站在距离源渡二十米远的地方，源渡坐在办公桌后，副司令站在他旁边。“我们最近几次战斗的战术简直是灾难性的。我们总是零星地派遣部队，导致不必要的损害和无谓的伤亡。这些文件正式抗议这些战术，并提议让 01 和 02 号机作为先锋，而不是 00 号机。”明日香说道，陈述了文件中的主要观点。

The German redhead had submitted them through formal UN channels rather than the internal NERV ones. She'd even called in a favor or two from acquaintances back in Germany, including a former classmate who'd have flunked if not for her tutoring, who also just so happened to be the daughter of the current German Foreign Minister.  
这位德国红发少女是通过联合国的正式渠道提交这些文件，而不是 NERV 的内部渠道。她甚至动用了一些在德国的熟人关系，包括一个如果不是她辅导就可能不及格的前同学，而这位同学恰好是现任德国外交部长的女儿。

"I see." Gendo said as he perused the Latin letters before continuing: "But you've wasted your time."  
“我明白了。”源渡一边浏览着拉丁字母的文件一边继续说道：“但你浪费了时间。”

"Now wait-!" Asuka began in protest before Vice Commander Fuyutsuki intervened to clarify:  
"等等-！" 明日香开始抗议，但副司令冬月介入了，以澄清：

"It's pointless, Pilot Sohryu, because Unit-00 is being scrapped."  
"这是徒劳的，碇司令，因为零号机即将被报废。"

"So you see, we are left with no option but to go with your proposal as Units-01 and 02 are the only ones left." Gendo added as he closed the manilla folders before returning his hands to their steepled position.  
"所以你看，我们别无选择，只能采纳你的提议，因为初号机和二号机是我们仅存的机体。" 碇源堂补充道，他合上了马尼拉文件夹，双手再次叠放在胸前。

"But why? Our Evas were also-!" Asuka asked perplexedly.  
"但为什么？我们的 Eva 也——！" 明日香困惑地问道。

"Your Evas were only minorly exposed and the contamination is negligible and easily repaired." Gendo's answer cut her off before the sensei added:  
"你们的 Eva 只是轻微暴露，污染微乎其微，且易于修复。" 碇源堂打断了她，随后老师补充道：

"Unit-00 however, was exposed continuously for the duration of the battle, and even after the Angel was ejected, the…" Fuyutsuki paused looking for the right word "…internals of the Eva, never properly reset and recovered."  
"然而，零号机在整个战斗期间持续暴露，甚至在使徒被排出后，Eva 的……" 冬月停顿了一下，寻找合适的词 "……内部，从未正确重置和恢复。"

"And let me guess, it's cheaper to scrap it and wait for a new one than it is to fix it."  
"让我猜猜，报废它然后等新的，比修理它更便宜吧。"

"Correct, just like with the Fourth Child's intended unit. The First Child will join him on the Reserve Combat Roster." the Supreme Commander said as Asuka remembered the fight with the 13th Angel before more of Gendo's words broke her out of her reverie: "If there is nothing else Pilot Sohryu, you are dismissed."  
"没错，就像第四适格者原本要驾驶的机体一样。第一适格者将与他一同加入预备战斗名单。"" 最高指挥官说道，而明日香回想起与第 13 使徒的战斗，直到更多源堂的话语将她从沉思中拉回：""如果没有其他事，驾驶员惣流，你可以离开了。"

Asuka grit her teeth, turned smartly and walked out of the kabbalah covered room.  
明日香咬紧牙关，利落地转身走出了那间挂满卡巴拉符号的房间。

"It may have helped if she had submitted it a month ago." Gendo began when the Second Child had left and tossed twelve hours' worth of paperwork in a desk drawer "Still it'll help us shift the blame of the loss of Unit-00 onto the old men and perhaps give us breathing room."  
"如果她一个月前就提交了，或许会好些。" 当二号适格者离开后，源堂开始说道，并将十二小时的文书工作扔进了办公桌抽屉，"尽管如此，这能帮我们将零号机的损失归咎于那些老头子，或许还能给我们争取一些喘息的空间。"

"Any room it might have given us was squandered when you released Rei from the hospital." The Vice Commander said in bitter tones.  
"任何可能给我们带来的空间都被你从医院释放绫波时浪费掉了。" 副司令用苦涩的语气说道。"

"It was necessary." "那是必要的。"

"The old men aren't senile yet. They know any normal person should be dead, or contaminated beyond saving, but definitely not given a clean bill of health and released from the hospital in less than forty-eight hours!" The old sensei's voice raised at the end of his rant about what he felt was an action that jeopardized everything.  
"那些老人还没糊涂。他们知道任何正常人应该已经死了，或是受到无法挽救的污染，绝不可能在不到四十八小时内就获得健康证明并从医院释放！" 老导师在对他认为危及一切的行为发泄不满时，声音提高了。

"We need to see how she responds to stimuli in order to determine if we need to activate the third." Gendo responded, his pose never shifting.  
"我们需要观察她对刺激的反应，以确定是否需要启动第三阶段。" 碇源堂回应道，他的姿势始终未变。

"The committee are still going to be suspicious." Fuyutsuki said after a long audible sigh.  
"委员会仍然会心存疑虑。" 冬月在长长地叹了口气后说道。

"Perhaps, but for the moment they are rather preoccupied." Gendo said as a smile formed under his hands.  
“或许吧，但眼下他们颇为忙碌。”碇源堂说道，双手下隐约露出一丝微笑。

**NERV Escalator: Some hours later  
NERV 自动扶梯：数小时后**

'That **BASTARD!**' Dr. Ritsuko Akagi fumed as she stood on the escalator, her hand subconsciously rubbing her arm as her skin still crawled from the stares and leers she knew were hiding behind the committee's red numbered monoliths.  
‘那个混蛋！’赤木律子博士站在自动扶梯上，愤愤不平，她的手无意识地揉着胳膊，感觉皮肤因那些她知道隐藏在委员会红色编号巨石后的目光和淫笑而阵阵发麻。

She'd told him it was foolish to release Rei, better to just keep her in Terminal Dogma, there was only one Angel left anyway, they wouldn't need to hide her for long at all. But no he just had to have it his way, he couldn't bear to see his favorite doll all cooped up.  
她曾告诉他释放零是愚蠢的，最好还是将她留在最终教条区，毕竟只剩下一个使徒了，他们根本不需要隐藏她太久。但他偏要一意孤行，无法忍受他最爱的玩偶被囚禁。

'Favorite?' Ritsuko thought at the word her rambling thoughts had used, oh sure she'd done everything Gendo had asked. Let him defile her in every way she knew. Her womanly body by never being the object of his touch but merely a pale substitute for what, no who, he really wanted. Her scientific skill by burning her ethics for the sake of his scenario, and her potential motherhood by never letting their trysts be anything more, never having that thing that ties you to someone forever, family.  
'最爱？' 听到这个词，律子思绪纷乱，哦，当然，她确实完成了源堂要求的一切。任由他在她所知的一切方式上玷污她。她的女性身体，从未成为他触碰的对象，只是他真正渴望的、那个人的苍白替代品。她的科学才能，为了他的剧本而焚毁了她的伦理。她的潜在母性，从未让他们的幽会成为更多，从未拥有那将你永远与某人绑在一起的东西——家庭。

Still for all of that, she knew she wasn't the favorite. She'd lost.  
尽管如此，她知道她并非他的最爱。她已经输了。

'No! he sacrificed me to protect his favorite little doll! I'm such a fool!' Ritsuko thought, tears in her eyes as her fist struck the escalator. But as she sobbed an idea entered her mind:  
“不！他为了保护他心爱的小玩偶牺牲了我！我真是个傻瓜！” 律子心想，泪水盈眶，拳头重重地砸在扶梯上。但当她啜泣时，一个念头闪过脑海：

'Yes…If I've tainted myself so.' She thought as she looked down at hands she didn't recognize 'Then the best thing to do is corrupt that last bond you have with _her_, show him all your dark secrets.'  
“是的……如果我已经玷污了自己。” 她看着那双陌生的手心想，“那么最好的办法就是破坏你与她最后的纽带，向他展示你所有的黑暗秘密。”

Her intellect, easily among the top five on the planet, already was working out the details as the escalator brought her to her destination. Working hastily to ensure no one would be watching she fished out her phone from her pocket and pressed call.  
她的智慧，无疑是地球上最顶尖的五人之一，已经在扶梯带她到达目的地的同时，迅速构思出了细节。她急忙确保无人注意，从口袋里掏出手机，按下了呼叫键。

"Listen carefully, for the next few minutes you'll be free from the secret service. Come here now while you can." Ritsuko instructed as the person on the other end of the line picked up the phone before abruptly hanging up.  
“仔细听着，接下来的几分钟你将摆脱秘密服务的束缚。趁现在还能行动，赶紧过来。”律子指示道，电话那头的人刚接起电话，她便突然挂断了。

"Ritsuko?" Shinji said bewilderedly to the dead line before looking behind him and seeing the stern looking faces of Asuka and Misato sitting at the kitchen table. He'd put the call on speaker thinking Ritsuko had news about Rei or sync tests.  
“律子？”真嗣对着已无声音的电话困惑地说道，随后回头看到坐在餐桌旁表情严肃的明日香和美里。他本以为律子有关于丽或同步测试的消息，才开了免提。

He sighed, before looking back at them.  
他叹了口气，然后再次看向她们。

"Right, let's go." "好，我们走吧。"

**Terminal Dogma: Forty minutes later  
最终教条区：四十分钟后**

"I wanted you to come alone." Ritsuko said annoyed as she looked at the pair of Eva pilots standing before her.  
"我本想让你一个人来的。" 律子不悦地说道，目光扫过站在她面前的两位 EVA 驾驶员。

"Anything you want to show him, you can also show me," Asuka said her arms crossed in defiance as she added "We're a team."  
“任何你想给他看的东西，也可以给我看，”明日香交叉双臂，挑衅地说道，“我们是一个团队。”

"Fine." Ritsuko acquiesced as she led them down the dimly lit passages to the entrance behind which lay all that NERV never wanted to see the light of day, the ominous metal door covered in signs promising severe punishments to trespassers.  
“好吧。”律子妥协道，带领她们穿过昏暗的通道，来到那扇隐藏着 NERV 不愿见光的一切的入口前，一扇覆盖着警告标志、预示着对闯入者严惩不贷的不祥金属门。

Ritsuko swiped her keycard, but instead of the expected green light and hissing of the doors, her eyes instead saw the hurtful red of rejection while her ears heard the distinct cocking of a pistol behind her followed by the telltale cold of a metal barrel creeping through her lab coat.  
律子刷了她的门禁卡，但预期的绿灯和门开启的嘶嘶声并未出现，取而代之的是刺眼的红色拒绝信号，紧接着她听到身后手枪上膛的清晰声响，以及实验室外套下冰冷的金属枪管触感。

"Sorry, it won't work without my password." Misato Katsuragi, her old friend, said behind her while Asuka and Shinji grimaced. They hadn't wanted it to come to this, but hadn't seen another way when Misato explained the gift the ponytailed spy had left.  
"抱歉，没有我的密码这行不通。" 她的老朋友葛城美里在背后说道，而明日香和真嗣则皱起了眉头。他们本不希望事情发展到这一步，但在美里解释了那位马尾间谍留下的礼物后，他们似乎别无选择。

"I see, did Kaji arrange this?" Ritsuko answered cool and calmly, like one unafraid of death.  
"我明白了，这是加持安排的吗？" 律子冷静而沉着地回答，仿佛对死亡无所畏惧。

"Show them to us. All the secrets you've buried here." Misato said rather than answering the question, her face and tone remaining stern.  
"把它们展示给我们看。你在这里埋藏的所有秘密。" 美里没有直接回答问题，她的表情和语气依旧严肃。

"Very well." Ritsuko said before stepping aside to let Misato use Kaji's latest gift. The doors now parted, and without logging that thye were opened or who had entered. The quartet went to an elevator that would take them to the deepest recesses of NERV. After a long, quiet ride the doors finally opened and Dr. Akagi led them along.  
“很好。” 律子说着，侧身让美里使用加持最新的礼物。门现在分开了，没有记录它们被打开或谁进入了。四人走向一部电梯，将带他们到达 NERV 的最深处。经过一段漫长而寂静的旅程，门终于打开，赤木博士带领他们前行。

Asuka noticed the signs, helpfully written in English and not just Kanji.  
明日香注意到那些标志，友好地用英文而不是仅用汉字书写。

'Artificial Evolution Laboratory, Annex 03?' Her mind thought as it read the sign. 'What does this mean?' She thought as they entered and were met with the sight of old rusting medical equipment and metal furniture, punctuated by bare concrete walls.  
‘人工进化实验室，附录 03？’ 她边读边想，‘这是什么意思？’ 当他们进入时，映入眼帘的是老旧生锈的医疗设备和金属家具，点缀着裸露的混凝土墙。

"This looks just like Rei's old apartment." Shinji said, giving voice to what they were all thinking.  
“这看起来就像丽以前的公寓。”真嗣说道，说出了他们所有人心中的想法。

"That's not surprising. This is the place Rei was born."  
“这并不奇怪。这里是丽出生的地方。”

"She was what?" Shinji and Misato said in unison, shocked by what they heard.  
“她是什么？”真嗣和美里异口同声地说道，震惊于他们所听到的。

"Born here? Is she a test tube baby or something?" Asuka asked a moment later. Her mind putting together the name of the place they were in and the revelation that Rei came from it.  
"在这里出生的？她是试管婴儿之类的吗？" 明日香稍后问道。她的脑海中将他们所在地的名字和丽来自这里的消息联系了起来。

"In a sense, the visions of light and water that flow through her consciousness are reflections of this place." Ritsuko said, being rather more psychological than giving a clear answer.  
"从某种意义上说，她意识中流动的光与水的景象，是这个地方的映射。" 律子说道，这番话更多的是心理学上的解释，而非明确的答案。

"This isn't what I came to see." Misato said after a moment, digesting the reason why the First Child had no family to speak of and no records that weren't clearly fabricated.  
"这不是我想看到的。" 美里片刻后说道，她消化了为什么第一适格者没有任何家庭背景，也没有任何不是明显捏造的记录。

"I know that, Misato." Ritsuko responded curtly, the venom she laced in her voice as she said the purple-head's name belied their earlier friendship.  
"我知道的，美里。" 律子冷冷地回应，她在说出紫发女子名字时声音中夹带的恶意，掩盖了她们早先的友谊。

They moved out of the depressing concrete box and made their way onto a barely lit walkway until Ritsuko found the power lever. Flipping it up and closing the circuit she not just revealed their path but also a vast cavern. A vast cavern filled with bodies.  
他们离开了那座压抑的混凝土盒子，走上了一条光线微弱的步道，直到律子找到了电源开关。她拉起开关，闭合电路，不仅照亮了他们的道路，还揭示了一个巨大的洞穴。一个装满了尸体的巨大洞穴。

"Is that an Eva?" Shinji asked as he looked at the sight before them. Several, possible dozens of enormous skeletons, interwoven with mechanical parts, lay strewn about as far as the eye could see.  
"那是 EVA 吗？" 真嗣问道，他看着眼前的景象。几具，或许是几十具巨大的骨架，与机械部件交织在一起，散布在视线所及之处。

"The first" Dr. Akagi began leaning casually against the gantry, seemingly unbothered by the gigantic remains before she continued, "a failure, we abandoned it ten years ago."  
"第一个" 赤木律子博士开始随意地靠在发射台上，似乎对眼前巨大的残骸毫不在意，接着说，"失败品，我们十年前就放弃了。"

"A graveyard for Evas." Shinji rued at the scene. While Asuka's hands gripped the scaffold until her knuckles were white before asking:  
"Eva 的坟场。" 真嗣对着这景象感到悲哀。而明日香的手紧抓着脚手架，直到指节发白，然后问道：

"Just what are Evas anyway!?" The German redhead asked with her trademarked temper as she looked at the faux-blonde doctor demanding an explanation.  
"Eva 到底是什么东西！？" 这位德国红发少女带着她标志性的脾气问道，目光紧盯着那位假金发博士，要求一个解释。

Ritsuko looked up to the still obscure ceiling of the cavern, eyes lost in the dark void as she answered.  
律子抬头望向洞穴中依旧模糊不清的天花板，双眼迷失在黑暗的虚空中，回答道。

"Fifteen years ago Mankind found a god, and in his hubris tried to make it his own and was punished for such arrogance…" Dr. Akagi answered, she'd wanted to wait more before making such a revelation but…  
"十五年前，人类发现了一位神，出于傲慢试图将其据为己有，并因此受到了惩罚……" 赤木博士回答道，她本想再等待一段时间才揭露这一真相，但……

"The Second Impact…" Asuka nodded in understanding, remembering their old sensei's lectures on that time.  
"第二次冲击……" 明日香点头表示理解，回忆起他们旧日老师的那些关于那个时代的讲课。

"But Mankind couldn't let the god, and its power go, so from that god, Adam…"  
"但人类无法放弃这位神及其力量，因此从那位神，亚当……"

"The white giant." Asuka said, remembering the being she had seen every time she had closed her eyes for a week after the battle with Arael.  
"白色巨人。" 明日香说道，回想起每次与亚拉尔战斗后闭上眼睛一周内都会看到的那个存在。

"Correct, the bodies of the Evangelions are made from the Angels, our own enemy." Ritsuko answered, though not entirely accurately, but she doubted even Asuka would understand the differences between Adam and Lilith.  
"没错，EVA 的身体是由使徒，我们的敌人所构成的。" 律子回答道，虽然并不完全准确，但她怀疑即使是明日香也不会理解亚当和莉莉丝之间的区别。

"So…they are… cloned flesh wrapped in armor." Shinji said haltingly, trying to make sense of what he had heard.  
"所以…它们是…包裹在装甲里的克隆肉体。" 真嗣断断续续地说着，试图理解他所听到的信息。

"But if they're flesh and blood why do they need electricity to move, well most of the time." Misato asked, wanting to figure out the truth of Mankind's ultimate weapon. The public had never really been told what Evas were, to them they were just giant robotic mechs. Misato had known that wasn't true though, metal doesn't bleed.  
"但如果它们是血肉之躯，为什么还需要电力来移动，虽然大多数时候是这样。" 美里问道，想要揭开人类终极武器的真相。公众从未真正被告知 EVA 是什么，对他们来说，它们只是巨大的机器人。但美里知道那不是真的，金属是不会流血的。

"You know how if you put an electric current through a fish, even a recently dead one, it will cause it to move as the electricity makes its muscles to contract and relax?" Ritsuko began after a moments pause to think of a suitable example. "That is essentially, though only on a much larger scale, how an Eva functions when it has a pilot. Albeit with more finesse thanks to the entry plug and its onboard computers." The Doctor said, a small smirk of pride managing to find its way on her face as she talked, "In essence the pilot thinks where or how they want to move, these thoughts synchronize with the Eva's systems, which then relays instructions to the body. The supercomputer then directs the current to the associated muscles from its scans of the Eva's core."  
"你知道如果给一条鱼通上电流，即使是刚死的鱼，它也会因为电流使肌肉收缩和放松而动起来吗？" 赤木律子在思考片刻后举了个恰当的例子，"这基本上就是 Eva 运作的原理，只是规模要大得多。多亏了插入栓和机载计算机，它的动作更加精细。" 医生说道，脸上露出一丝自豪的微笑，"本质上，驾驶员想移动的位置或方式，这些想法与 Eva 的系统同步，然后系统将指令传递给身体。超级计算机根据对 Eva 核心的扫描，将电流导向相应的肌肉。"

"Like a puppet." Shinji said, processing the explanation.  
"就像个傀儡。" 真嗣说道，消化着这个解释。

"Or a doll." Asuka added in bitter tones.  
"或者一个玩偶。" 明日香带着苦涩的语气补充道。

"Hence the higher the sync-rate the faster the reaction times, since it reduces delay between the pilot's thoughts and the sympathetic response from the Eva. That's why armor covers the entire body." Misato said. 'And is ridiculously expensive.' Her mind added. She shook her head, trying to get work out of her thoughts to focus on the truth before her.  
"因此，同步率越高，反应速度就越快，因为它减少了驾驶员思维与 Eva 共鸣反应之间的延迟。这就是为什么装甲覆盖全身的原因。" 美里说道。'而且贵得离谱。' 她的内心补充道。她摇了摇头，试图将工作从思绪中排除，专注于眼前的真相。

"What about the AT Field then?" Asuka asked. While she understood how the Eva moved she didn't understand how electricity made a nigh impenetrable barrier.  
"那么 AT 力场呢？" 明日香问道。虽然她理解 Eva 是如何移动的，但她不明白电力是如何形成几乎无法穿透的屏障的。

"The battery may move the muscles but the core is what makes the AT Field." Ritsuko said.  
"电池或许能驱动肌肉，但核心才是产生 AT 力场的原因。" 律子说道。

"How does it do that?" Shinji asked the faux blonde.  
“它是怎么做到的？”真嗣问那位假金发女郎。

"Do you ever wonder how the pilot of an Eva Unit is chosen?" Dr. Akagi said, answering their question with one of her own. When it became obvious none of them were forthcoming with an answer, not even Asuka Langley Sohryu, the one most proud of being a pilot, Ritsuko continued:  
“你们有没有想过，EVA 的驾驶员是如何被选中的？”赤木博士说道，用一个问题回答了他们的问题。当明显没有人愿意回答，甚至连最自豪于成为驾驶员的惣流·明日香·兰格雷也不例外时，律子继续说道：

"We didn't want to use children." The doctor paused for a moment before heading over to the handrail, resting her arms against it and staring down at years of failure, "Originally the chosen pilots were brilliant, trusted scientists who understood how it all worked. But when they tried to activate the Evas they were sucked into the core." Ritsuko looked back at them her eyes boring into the brown-haired boy. "You should remember that Shinji."  
“我们原本并不想使用孩子。”博士停顿了一下，然后走向栏杆，将双臂靠在上面，凝视着多年的失败，“最初选定的驾驶员是杰出、值得信赖的科学家，他们理解这一切是如何运作的。但当他们试图启动 EVA 时，却被吸入了核心。”律子回头看着他们，目光直射向那位棕色头发的男孩。“你应该记得这一点，真嗣。”

"Doctor!" Misato warned her arm raising up her pistol, though her warning didn't do much to dissuade her old college friend from continuing.  
"医生！" 美里警告道，手臂举起手枪，尽管她的警告并未能阻止她的老大学朋友继续说下去。

"I mean you were there when we found out the hard way it needed a soul. The core was initially only supposed to be a relay." Ritsuko continued her dark eyes locked with Shinji's cobalt orbs before shifting to Asuka's cerulean, "so we tried again, but the mitigation measures we put in place only partly worked with Kyoko."  
"我的意思是，你当时在场，我们艰难地发现它需要一个灵魂。核心最初只被设计为一个中继器。" 律子继续说道，她的深色眼睛紧盯着真嗣的钴蓝色眼眸，随后转向明日香的蔚蓝色，"所以我们再次尝试，但我们采取的缓解措施只对京子部分有效。"

"Our mothers' souls are in the core…" Asuka said as the pieces all fell in place in her mind as the head of Project E continued:  
"我们母亲的灵魂在核心里……" 明日香说道，所有线索在她脑海中串联起来，E 计划负责人继续说道：

"After the failed contact experiments we fully learned that Evas needed a soul in the core to function. And that they needed a strong bond, like mother to child with the pilot, to even activate an Eva, much less synchronize with it. Sure we did try using trained Special Forces with living mothers to be the pilots, but for reasons we don't fully understand only people born after Second Impact can successfully synchronize with an Eva." Ritsuko said as she turned her back on them again before turning around to deliver the last line. "So really there's nothing special about the pilots, any child will do, and you and your classmates _are_ the oldest cadre we can pull from."  
"在失败的接触实验后，我们彻底明白了 Eva 需要核心中有一个灵魂才能运作。而且它们需要与驾驶员之间建立一种强烈的纽带，就像母子关系一样，才能激活 Eva，更不用说与之同步了。当然，我们确实尝试过使用训练有素的特种部队成员，并让他们的母亲作为驾驶员，但由于某些我们不完全理解的原因，只有第二次冲击后出生的人才能成功与 Eva 同步。" 赤木律子说完这些，再次背对他们，然后转过身来补充最后一句。"所以实际上，驾驶员并没有什么特别之处，任何孩子都可以，而你和你的同学们是我们能招募的最年长的群体。"

"Is that how an Eva moves on its own then?" Asuka asked, her tone becoming harsh, almost shrill as she asked her question. "Is that why we can feel their presence when we're in the Eva?"  
"那么，Eva 就是这样自行移动的吗？" 明日香问道，她的语气变得尖锐，几乎刺耳。"这就是为什么我们在 Eva 里能感受到它们的存在吗？"

"You can feel them?!" It was the good doctor's turn to be surprised, she regained her composure though quickly before answering.  
"你能感受到它们？！" 轮到这位好医生感到惊讶了，她迅速恢复了镇定，然后回答道。

"I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, as I said every Eva requires a human soul in its core to function, most often the pilot's mother, as only a soul can create an AT field. The fact that you made contact is likely a symptom of that bond." Ritsuko said, confirming their worst fears before adding "As for moving on its own. That as far as we can tell is when the soul inside the Eva takes direct control. If only there was more time to study it."  
"我想我不该感到惊讶，正如我所说，每个 Eva 的核心都需要一个人类的灵魂才能运作，通常是驾驶员的母亲，因为只有灵魂才能创造出 AT 力场。你能够与之接触，很可能就是这种联系的症状。" 律子说道，证实了他们最深的担忧，接着补充道："至于自行移动，据我们所知，这是 Eva 内部的灵魂直接控制的结果。如果能有更多时间研究它就好了。"

"It doesn't need power for that?" Misato asked in a surprised tone.  
"那样不需要能量吗？" 美里用惊讶的语气问道。

"Do you need to plug into a wall when you want to move your arm?" Ritsuko said flippantly before admitting: "Perhaps the soul itself is the power source. Metaphysical Biology is still a new field. Evas don't really need a pilot for anything, they can activate and move on their own," Ristsuko paused for a moment, the memory of Unit-01 activating to shield Shinji from falling debris during the 3rd Angel's attack replaying in her mind before she continued, "But that happens so rarely it cannot be relied upon. Which is why we need pilots, to keep these demi-gods in line and make it more predictable what they will do since we can't communicate with the soul in the core. Much less get it out." Ritsuko added at the end, cutting off the next question she knew the pilots would have.  
"你想移动手臂时需要插电吗？" 律子轻蔑地说道，随后承认："或许灵魂本身就是能量源。形而上学生物学仍是一门新兴学科。Eva 实际上并不需要驾驶员来操作，它们可以自行激活并移动，" 律子停顿了一下，脑海中回放着初号机在第三次使徒攻击中激活以保护真嗣免受坠落碎片伤害的记忆，然后继续说道，"但这种情况极为罕见，不能依赖。这就是为什么我们需要驾驶员，来控制这些半神并使它们的行为更加可预测，因为我们无法与核心中的灵魂沟通，更不用说将其取出。" 律子最后补充道，打断了她知道驾驶员们接下来会问的问题。

The three roommates stood in muted horror at the revelations they had heard. It all made such perfect sense given what they had experienced, their worst fears made-  
三位室友站在那里，被他们听到的真相震惊得哑口无言。这一切与他们的经历完全吻合，他们最深的恐惧被——

Suddenly the two women turned at once as they heard a body crash down on the gantry. Shinji had lost his footing and was just sitting, shaking on the scaffold.  
突然，两位女性同时转身，听到有人从平台上摔了下来。真嗣失去了平衡，正坐在脚手架上颤抖。

"Shinji!" Both Asuka and Misato let out in unison as they rushed to his side.  
"真嗣！" 明日香和美里齐声喊道，急忙冲到他身边。

"Shinji what's wrong?!" Asuka asked, her hands on either of Shinji's cheeks as she forced him to look at her, trying to get him to calm down as tears began to flow.  
"真嗣，怎么了？！" 明日香问道，双手捧着真嗣的脸颊，强迫他看着自己，试图让他平静下来，泪水开始涌出。

"Toji…I…killed Toji's mother!" Shinji got out through the sobs.  
"东治……我……我杀了东治的妈妈！" 真嗣哽咽着说。

The words causing the end of their battle against the 13th Angel to flash before the redhead's eyes again as she saw Unit-01, Shinji, stabbing into the core of Unit-03, which if Ritsuko was telling the truth had housed the soul of the late Mrs. Suzuhara.  
当红发少女再次看到零号机，即真嗣，刺入三号机的核心时，那些导致他们与第 13 使徒战斗终结的话语在她眼前闪现，如果赤木律子说的是真的，那核心里曾容纳着已故的铃原太太的灵魂。

"You're lying!" Asuka screamed at Dr. Akagi as she cradled Shinji in her arms, "What about Rei then!? How's she able to pilot?!" Asuka asked, grasping at straws.  
“你在撒谎！”明日香对着赤木博士尖叫，她怀抱着真嗣，“那绫波呢？！她怎么能驾驶？！”明日香抓住最后一丝希望问道。

"Come with me. There's one last secret to show you." Ritsuko said after a long silence. The Major and lover managing to get Shinji on his feet, standing on either side to support him. Ritsuko silently cursing as she saw how they were moving together, and sour look on her face.  
“跟我来。还有一个最后的秘密要给你看。”长时间的沉默后，赤木律子说道。她和大校两人设法让真嗣站起身，分别站在两侧支撑着他。律子默默咒骂着，看着他们一起移动的样子，脸上露出不悦的表情。

They made their way to another room, dark like all the others though Asuka could make out complicated-looking equipment and lettering she knew to be DNA sequences on the walls.  
他们走进了另一个房间，和其他房间一样昏暗，但明日香能辨认出墙上复杂的设备和字母，她知道那是 DNA 序列。

"So this is the core of the dummy plug?" Misato asked as she looked at the complex piping and machinery.  
“所以这就是傀儡系统的核心？”美里问道，她看着复杂的管道和机械。

"This is where we produce the components." Ritsuko said, clarifying as she pressed a button on a nearby controller, bringing light to the truth.  
“这里是我们生产组件的地方。”律子解释道，她按下附近控制器上的按钮，揭示了真相的光芒。

"Oh my God it's Rei!" Shinji said, his tongue finding words again as his eyes beheld a new horror. Dozens of naked bodies, floating in what looked to be LCL, all with the face of Rei Ayanami. All smiling a wicked smile as their heads turned to look at the source of the noise, responding to outside stimuli and unnerving the three newcomers.  
"哦，天哪，是丽！" 真嗣说道，他的舌头终于找到了词汇，当他的眼睛目睹了一个新的恐怖。数十具赤裸的身体，漂浮在看似是 LCL 的液体中，每一张脸都是绫波丽。她们都带着邪恶的微笑，头转向声音的来源，对外界刺激做出反应，让三位新来者感到不安。

"They're all Rei you mean the dummy plugs are-!?" Misato began before Ritsuko cut her off.  
"你是说她们都是丽，那些模拟插头是——？！" 美里开始说道，但被律子打断了。

"Aha, these are the core of the dummy plugs, they're what makes the system work."  
"啊哈，这些是模拟插头的核心，正是它们让系统运作起来。"

"So when I crushed the dummy plug," Asuka said, her voice quiet as her mind replayed the image of her Unit-02 crushing the dummy plug that had been in Bardiel "I crushed…"  
"所以当我碾碎那个模拟插入栓时，" 明日香说道，她的声音低沉，脑海中回放着二号机碾碎巴迪尔中的模拟插入栓的画面，"我碾碎了……"

"An empty vessel. Nothing but spare parts really, a spare Rei if you will." Ritsuko answered for her, her tone a little too giddy for such morbidity. Her tone shifted though, anger filling every word of what she said next, "Empty husks that have no right to live!"  
"一个空壳。不过是些备用零件，可以说是另一个零号机。" 律子替她回答，语气中带着些许不合时宜的兴奋。但她的语气随即转变，愤怒充斥着每一个字，"这些空壳没有资格活下去！"

Ritsuko Akagi pressed another button on the controller in her hand and the smiling bodies in the LCL began to break apart, limbs, faces, bones, and organs floating around in that primordial soup while it seemed the Reis were _laughing_ as they met oblivion.  
赤木律子按下手中的控制器上的另一个按钮，LCL 中那些微笑的躯体开始分解，四肢、面孔、骨骼和器官在这原始的液体中漂浮，而那些零号机似乎在迎接消亡时还在笑。

Misato's face was glued to the scene until she heard Ritsuko again:  
美里一直紧盯着这一幕，直到再次听到律子的话：

"Hey!" The doctor protested. Shinji had jumped forward, forced out of his malaise by the sight and grabbed Ritsuko's arms while Asuka pried the controller from her fingers.  
“嘿！”医生抗议道。真嗣被眼前的景象驱散了恍惚，猛地冲上前，抓住了律子的手臂，而明日香则从她手指间夺过了控制器。

"I can't stop it!" Asuka screamed in desperation as she pressed every button on the controller Ritsuko had used. Shinji let go of the doctor's arms, the faux blonde crumpling to her knees, her face staring at the floor, and went over to try and help Asuka while Misato stepped up to directly in front of her former friend.  
“我停不下来！”明日香绝望地尖叫着，疯狂按下律子用过的控制器上的每一个按钮。真嗣松开了医生的手臂，金发假面瘫跪倒在地，脸庞紧贴着地板，他走过去试图帮助明日香，而美里则直接站到了她昔日的朋友面前。

"Stop this! Stop this now!" Misato said, the barrel of her pistol parting the faux blond hair as it rested directly on her head.  
“住手！现在就停下！”美里喊道，她的手枪枪管分开那假金发，直接抵在了她的头上。

"It's impossible it's done already. I've been such a fool, everything I did, and still I lost." Ritsuko said clearly holding back sobs before she lifted her face up so the gun barrel was now pointing directly at her temple and she was looking directly into Misato's brown eyes: "If you're going to shoot me then go ahead, I'd welcome death!"  
“不可能，已经结束了。我一直是个傻瓜，我所做的一切，最终还是输了。”律子明显在压抑着抽泣，随后她抬起脸，让枪管直指自己的太阳穴，直视着美里的棕色眼睛：“如果你要开枪，那就来吧，我欢迎死亡！”

The Second and Third Child let out more frantic screams as they tried everything. Asuka tossing the useless gadget to the side and instead trying to hit against the glass with Shinji, but it was useless. Soon the bodies had degenerated to the point where only a slurry of amino acids remained, a last red eye dissolving in front of them as Asuka flung herself into Shinji's arms not wanting to look at it anymore and both teenagers began crying in each other's embrace.  
第二和第三适格者发出了更加狂乱的尖叫，他们尝试了一切办法。明日香将无用的装置扔到一旁，转而与真嗣一起用身体撞击玻璃，但这一切都是徒劳。很快，身体已经退化到只剩下氨基酸混合物，最后一颗红眼在他们面前溶解，明日香扑进真嗣的怀里，不愿再看，两个少年在彼此的怀抱中开始哭泣。

Misato held the gun there for a long moment, her eyes not breaking with Ritsuko's, until finally she lowered the weapon and turned away from the doctor's piercing green eyes.  
美里长时间地握着枪，目光始终未曾离开律子的眼睛，直到最终她放下武器，转身避开医生那锐利的绿色眼眸。

"If that's what you want, then you really are a fool."  
“如果你真想要那样，那你确实是个傻瓜。”

**A/N:** Well here we are. This one took a lot longer than the others because this episode in Evangelion is, to put it mildly, dense. Lots of revelations, important things and the like. I really hope it doesn't have too bad tonal whiplash, but with this episode, hell all the episodes in the final arc that's going to be tough to avoid.  
作者注：好吧，我们到了这里。这一章比其他的都花费了更长时间，因为《新世纪福音战士》中的这一集，说得委婉些，非常密集。充满了各种揭示、重要事件等等。我真心希望它不会出现太糟糕的情感突变，但面对这一集，乃至整个最终篇章的所有集数，要避免这种情况将会非常困难。

It also seemed like the perfect opportunity to put in an explanation of how I think Eva's work that makes logical sense and also my theory that Yui and Kyoko were the intended original pilots, since none of that is ever directly stated and is made more by inference.  
这似乎也是解释我认为 Eva 作品中逻辑自洽的部分，以及我的理论——Yui 和 Kyoko 原本是预定驾驶员的绝佳机会，因为这些内容从未被直接提及，更多是通过推理得出。

Next chapter everyone's favorite grey-haired boy will be making an appearance. Likewise I think it will also have delays since these last chapters need to be done right.  
下一章，大家最喜欢的灰发男孩将会登场。同样，我认为这一章也会有延迟，因为最后这几章需要做得完美。

As always let me know what you think.  
一如既往，欢迎告诉我你的想法。

### Chapter 15 Engelsbote und Glasherzen

**Onshi-Hakone Park, Tokyo-3: Afternoon  
御殿山公园，第三新东京市：午后**

Shinji Ikari, Third Child and designated pilot of Unit-01, wandered aimlessly along a brick path as the stifling heat of Tokyo-3's endless summer beat down upon him. But he paid no mind to the sweat as it flowed down his forehead. That is until the salty excretion burned his eyes and forced them closed. One sense removed his mind focused on the unending buzzing of the cicadas and cawing of crows overhead.  
碇真嗣，第三适格者兼初号机指定驾驶员，在一条砖砌小径上漫无目的地徘徊，第三新东京市无尽的夏日酷热无情地炙烤着他。但他并未在意额头上流淌的汗水，直到那咸涩的液体灼痛了他的眼睛，迫使他闭上了双眼。感官的缺失让他的注意力集中在了头顶上无休止的蝉鸣和乌鸦的叫声上。

His eyelids opened once more, cobalt irises seeing a bench shaded by a large maple tree nearby. His legs brought him toward it of their own accord, his aching feet finally allowed a respite as Shinji's gaze took in where he was. An unfamiliar plaza, in an unfamiliar park, with a fountain in the middle of brick paths radiating outward. The water gurgling as it flowed from the trumpets the stone cherubs held in their hands.  
他的眼睑再次张开，钴蓝色的虹膜看到了附近一棵大枫树下的长椅。他的双腿不由自主地向它走去，酸痛的双脚终于得到了片刻的休息，真嗣的目光环顾四周，发现自己身处一个陌生的广场，在一个陌生的公园里，中央有一个喷泉，砖砌小径向四周辐射。水流从石雕小天使手中的喇叭中潺潺流出。

"I ran away again." Shinji Ikari said to the empty park as his mind replayed the events that had led him here.  
"我又一次逃跑了。" 碇真嗣对着空无一人的公园说道，脑海中回放着将他带到这里的事件。

"_This is all I can do for you." Asuka Langley Sohryu, his comrade, his lover, his life, had said emptily as her left hand covered his, while her right went to the button of his jeans as the midday sun shone through the blinds in his room._  
"我能为你做的只有这些了。" 他的战友、他的爱人、他的生命——惣流·明日香·兰格雷，空洞地说道，她的左手覆盖在他的手上，而右手伸向他的牛仔裤纽扣，正午的阳光透过他房间的百叶窗洒落。

"_Don't touch me!" He'd screamed as he recoiled from her hand._  
"别碰我！" 他尖叫着，从她的手边退缩。

_His heart and mind had never left the place they'd left the faux-blonde crying in the ruins of wasted potential. Shinji wasn't sure what had happened to her. He remembered their purple-haired guardian had mumbled something about Ritsuko being in custody but beyond that he didn't know.  
他的心和思绪从未离开过那个他们留下假金发女孩在浪费潜力的废墟中哭泣的地方。真嗣不确定她后来怎么样了。他记得他们的紫发守护者曾含糊其辞地提到过律子被拘留了，但除此之外他一无所知。_

_Since what had happened in Terminal Dogma, neither of them had gone to school. He wasn't really sure for how long. Misato had covered with some excuse about both of them being ill. But, what Misato couldn't postpone forever was the next synch-test. And as the time approached when Shinji knew he would have to face Toji and Rei once more he became more and more anxious as his soul was drowned in guilt and despair.  
自从在终端教条发生那件事后，他们俩都没再去过学校。他不太确定已经有多久了。美里用他们俩都生病了的借口搪塞了过去。但是，美里无法永远推迟的，是下一次同步测试。随着真嗣知道他将不得不再次面对冬二和绫波的时间临近，他的内心越来越焦虑，灵魂被罪恶感和绝望淹没。_

_How could he look the boy whose mother he killed in the eye? How could he look at Ayanami the same way?  
他怎么能直视那个他害死了母亲的孩子？他怎么能以同样的方式看待绫波？_

_He and the German redhead hadn't been intimate at all since then, had barely even talked, only held each other as they drifted off to sleep through tears. Misato had forbade them sharing a bed when she first had learned of their relationship but in light of her wards most recent trauma had silently acquiesced.  
自那以后，他和那位德国红发女孩就再也没有亲密过，甚至连话都很少说，只是相拥而眠，泪水伴着他们入睡。美里一开始得知他们的关系后，禁止他们同床共枕，但考虑到她的孩子们最近遭受的创伤，她默默地默许了。_

_Now though it seemed Asuka was forcing the matter, trying to break the one she loved out of his malaise.  
但现在看来，明日香似乎在强行打破僵局，试图将她所爱的人从忧郁中解救出来。_

_Though in truth she wasn't much better. Asuka's usual fire was gone. Replaced by heavy bags that told of weariness and exhaustion under her eyes as every time she closed them all she saw were dozens of Reis dissolving before her until only the smiles remained, merging and morphing into one horrific visage. Reminiscent of the one she saw on a face she loved as it swayed back and forth from a hospital ceiling. Sometimes in her nightmares she even saw her mother's smile flash before her eyes followed by the image of her hand smashing the dummy plug.  
虽然说实话，她自己也好不到哪儿去。明日香往日的活力消失了，取而代之的是她眼下的重重黑眼圈，透露出疲惫和倦怠。每当她闭上眼睛，眼前就会出现数十个丽溶解的画面，直到只剩下微笑，这些微笑融合变形，形成一张恐怖的面孔，让她想起她所爱的人在医院天花板下来回摇摆的脸。有时在噩梦中，她甚至会看到母亲微笑的画面，紧接着是她用手砸碎模拟插头的场景。_

_So her limbs were merely and wearily going through the motions as she again reached for the button and zipper on his jeans, while her other tried to get under his blue shirt.  
于是她的四肢只是疲倦地重复着动作，再次伸手去解他牛仔裤上的纽扣和拉链，而另一只手则试图探入他的蓝色衬衫下。_

"_I said stop Asuka!" He yelled as he got up off the bed and his heart stopped as he saw the look on Asuka's face._  
“我说了停下，明日香！”他大喊着从床上起身，心脏猛地一跳，因为他看到了明日香脸上的表情。

_There was no smile or smirk, not even a scowl. Just a blank expression as she reached under the hem of her yellow shirt and tossed it aside, revealing her bare chest to him.  
没有微笑，没有讥笑，甚至连皱眉都没有。只有一片空白，她伸手从黄色衬衫的下摆探入，将其甩到一旁，露出了赤裸的胸膛对着他。_

"_Don't you want to feel better?" Her voice said without tone as she stood up from the bed and walked toward him and Shinji could swear he saw tears forming in the corners of her cerulean eyes. "Don't you want to be with me?" The German redhead said as her arms went around him, trying to bring him into her embrace._  
"你不想感觉好点吗？" 她毫无语调地问道，从床上站起身走向他，真嗣发誓他看到她天蓝色眼角泛起了泪光。"你不想和我在一起吗？" 这位德国红发女孩说着，双臂环绕着他，试图将他拥入怀中。

'_Not like this.' His mind thought as he did the one thing he'd promised he'd never do._  
'不是这样。' 他的内心想着，同时做了他曾发誓永远不会做的事。

_Not to her. 不是对她。_

_He ran away. 他跑开了。_

_Out from his room. 从他的房间里。_

_Out the front door. 冲出前门。_

_Out of the apartment building and into the city beyond.  
从公寓楼走出，步入城市深处。_

_He thought he heard her screaming his name, calling out to him, but he didn't look back, he couldn't look at her right now.  
他以为自己听到了她在尖叫他的名字，呼唤着他，但他没有回头，此刻他无法直视她。_

Which brought him to where he was now, on a park bench, alone, his head cradling in his hands as the weight of it all crashed upon him and his mind was adrift in the maelstrom of emotions colliding within.  
这让他来到了现在所在的地方，公园长椅上，独自一人，双手托着头，所有重担压下，内心情感的风暴在脑海中肆虐。

'Toji, I…I can't… I can't face him…'  
'冬二，我……我做不到……我无法面对他……'

'Rei…' '丽……'

'Asuka…' '明日香……'

'What can I do?' He asked himself desperately. The universe was silent in its answer for a few moments before Shinji's ears picked up something besides the ubiquitous cicada buzz. Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, being hummed by someone.  
“我能做些什么？”他绝望地自问。宇宙在片刻间沉默不语，直到真嗣的耳中捕捉到了除蝉鸣之外的声响。有人在哼唱贝多芬的第九交响曲。

Shinji picked up his head and looked in the direction the tune was coming from and saw a grey-haired boy in a school uniform sitting on the edge of the fountain, a stone cherub blowing a trumpet on either side of him as he looked to the sky.  
真嗣抬起头，顺着旋律传来的方向望去，只见一个灰白头发的男孩穿着校服坐在喷泉边缘，两侧各有一个石制小天使吹着喇叭，而他仰望着天空。

"The song is good." The grey-haired boy said as he turned his red eyes to regard Shinji.  
“这首歌不错。”灰白头发的男孩转过身，红色的眼睛注视着真嗣说道。

"Huh?" The Third Child said befuddled.  
"啊？" 第三适格者困惑地说道。

"Singing brings joy and revitalizes the human soul. I think that song is the highest achievement of the Lilin culture. Don't you agree? Shinji Ikari." The newcomer continued.  
"歌唱带来欢乐，使人的灵魂焕发新生。我认为那首歌是莉莉丝文化中的最高成就。你不这么认为吗？碇真嗣。" 新来者继续说道。

"How do you know my name?" Shinji asked surprised.  
"你怎么知道我的名字？" 真嗣惊讶地问道。

"Everyone knows your name. I don't mean to sound rude but you're rather ignorant of your own position." The red-eyed boy answered, causing Shinji Ikari to chuckle in response before he responded.  
"每个人都知道你的名字。我不是有意无礼，但你对自己的地位相当无知。" 红眼男孩回答道，这让碇真嗣轻笑出声，随后回应。

"I suppose you're right, and who are you then?"  
"我想你是对的，那么你是谁呢？"

"I'm Kaworu, Kaworu Nagisa."  
"我是渚薰，渚薰。"

**The Same Park: Twenty Minutes Later  
同一个公园：二十分钟后**

Asuka Langley Sohryu, Second Child, designated pilot of Unit-02, and usually bombastic redhead was worried.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷，二号机驾驶员，通常性格张扬的红发少女，此刻正忧心忡忡。

'I really fucked up.' The thought played across her mind for the thousandth time as she took a right turn down a brick path in the park she'd seen her lover go into but had lost track of in the thick branches and trunks.  
“我真的搞砸了。”这个念头在她脑海中第无数次闪过，她沿着公园里的一条砖砌小路右转，那是她看到爱人走进去的地方，但在茂密的树枝和树干中却跟丢了踪迹。

'I just thought…that maybe if we…that it could all go back to normal.' Her mind raced as it was trying to rationalize the choices that had led her to this moment.  
“我只是想……也许如果我们……一切都能回到从前。”她的思绪飞速运转，试图合理化那些将她引向此刻的选择。

'But that's no way to live Sohryu. That's what you did with Mama. Buried the pain behind walls and tried to pretend everything was fine.' The German redhead's inner voice told her and she shuddered as she thought about how she'd reverted to her same tendencies in the aftermath of seeing that which NERV had sequestered from all.  
“但那不是生活的方式，苏里尤。你就是这样对待妈妈的。把痛苦藏在高墙之后，试图假装一切都好。”德国红发女孩的内心声音告诉她，她颤抖着思考自己在看到 NERV 从所有人那里隐藏的东西后，是如何重蹈覆辙的。

Asuka's brooding was interrupted however as her ears heard something surreal. Laughter. _**Shinji's**_ laughter.  
然而，明日香的沉思被一种超现实的声音打断了。笑声。真嗣的笑声。

She followed the sound down the radial pathway she was on until as she entered the plaza, past the last bush her cerulean eyes caught those cobalt orbs she knew, breath catching in her throat, and her mind barely registering the grey back of the head next to those eyes.  
她顺着那声音沿着她所在的径向小路走去，直到进入广场，经过最后一丛灌木，她那蔚蓝的眼睛捕捉到了那对熟悉的钴蓝色眼眸，呼吸一窒，脑海中几乎没来得及记录那双眼睛旁边灰色的后脑勺。

"Asuka!" Shinji cried out, almost immediately, clearly not sharing her trepidation, as he leapt up from the bench he was sitting on and rushed over to her, only a last burst of will kept him from throwing his arms around her in a bear hug that would make Misato proud.  
"明日香！" 真嗣喊道，几乎立刻就打破了她的紧张，他从长椅上跳起来，冲向她，仅剩的一丝意志力阻止了他张开双臂给她一个会让美里引以为傲的熊抱。

"_Verdammter Idiot_!" Asuka began as she recovered and cursed in anger that wasn't false, as she wanted to vent her frustration as her fists formed balls at her side: "Just what were you thinking! Why I ought to-!"  
"该死的白痴！" 明日香回过神来，愤怒地咒骂着，这愤怒并非虚假，她想要发泄自己的沮丧，双拳紧握在身侧："你到底在想什么！我真该——！"

"You must be Asuka Langley Sohryu." A new voice interjected into the quarrel "I've heard so much about you, and I'm glad to make your acquaintance."  
"您一定是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。"一个新的声音插入了争吵，"我听说了许多关于您的事，很高兴能认识您。"

Asuka paused, her left hand which had been preparing to hit Shinji's shoulder, fingers so taught the whites of her knuckles were visible, relaxed as she turned her face to regard the grey-haired boy dressed in a school uniform before her.  
明日香停了下来，她原本准备打向真嗣肩膀的左手，手指紧绷到能看见指节发白，随着她转头看向面前穿着校服的灰发男孩而放松了。

Usually she abhorred men who carried the confident smirk his red-eyed face wore, but for some reason something about him was disarming, soothing almost and had her wits been fully about her Sohryu would have been suspicious of this fact, instead she merely asked:  
通常她讨厌那些脸上带着自信微笑的男性，但不知为何，他身上有种令人放松、几乎安抚人心的特质，如果她的理智完全在线，惣流本该对此感到怀疑，但她只是简单地问道：

"And who are you?" “你是谁？”

"This is Nagisa, Kaworu Nagisa." Shinji began, a smile on his face and his tone excited.  
"我是渚薰，渚薰。" 真嗣开始说道，脸上带着微笑，语气兴奋。

"I am like you, a pilot for Eva." He added, letting the silence of a moment's pause fill the plaza: "The Fifth Child."  
"我和你一样，是 Eva 的驾驶员。" 他补充道，让片刻的沉默填满广场："第五适格者。"

"The Fifth?" Asuka began in astonishment. "But we only have two Evas! Why are they sending us another pilot!"  
"第五？" 明日香惊讶地开口。"但我们只有两台 Eva！为什么还要派另一个驾驶员来！"

"I couldn't tell you why, but the fact is they have." Kaworu said, lying through his teeth before continuing: "Regardless I am happy to finally meet you."  
"我说不上来为什么，但事实就是如此。" 渚薰撒了个谎，接着说道："无论如何，我很高兴终于见到你了。"

"Well naturally." Asuka said as she flipped her hair back confidently and a smile crept onto her face, some the old fire returning. "I hope this baka wasn't boring you." She said with faux-derogation as she pointed her thumb at a sighing Shinji.  
"那是当然。" 明日香自信地甩了甩头发，脸上露出了笑容，昔日的锐气又回来了一些。"希望这个笨蛋没让你觉得无聊。" 她用假装的轻蔑语气说着，同时用拇指指向叹气的真嗣。

"Not at all, in fact I had been looking forward to meeting the both of you." Kaworu said, eyes darting back between the both of them as the three pilots formed a triangle on the bricks of the plaza.  
"一点儿也不，实际上我一直期待着与你们两位见面。" 渚薰说着，目光在两人之间来回移动，三位驾驶员在广场的砖石上形成了一个三角形。

"The both of us?" The secret lovers said in unison, the surprise evident in their tone.  
"我们两个？" 这对秘密恋人异口同声地说道，语气中的惊讶显而易见。

"Yes, the bond you have is quite intriguing." Kaworu continued, his smirk and stance never wavering, as his words sent both Shinji's and Asuka's hearts plunging. Shinji managed to recover first and after a gulp, he spoke, hoping the halting words weren't laced with worry:  
"是的，你们之间的联系相当耐人寻味。" Kaworu 继续说道，他的微笑和姿态始终未变，他的话让真嗣和明日香的心都沉了下去。真嗣最先恢复过来，咽了口唾沫后，他开口了，希望那断断续续的话语没有透露出担忧：

"You mean our teamwork in combat right?"  
"你是说我们在战斗中的合作吧？"

"Of course." Kaworu said as both pilots sighed in relief, and had Kaworu had more understanding of the Lilin, he would have rolled his eyes at the display.  
"当然。" 两位驾驶员松了口气，如果渚薰对人类有更多了解，他可能会对这一幕翻白眼。

"So when did you get here Fifth Child?" Asuka asked as she regained her composure.  
"你是什么时候到的，第五适任者？" 明日香恢复镇定后问道。

"Just recently. My flight from Germany arrived the day before yesterday." Kaworu began as he shifted his body so he was facing the German redhead before continuing: "_Und bitte, nennen Sie mich Kaworu._"  
"刚到不久。我从德国的航班前天刚抵达。" 渚薰调整姿势，面向德国红发少女继续说道："Und bitte, nennen Sie mich Kaworu."

Asuka let out a shriek of glee at hearing her native tongue and immediately began to question the red-eyed newcomer about how things were in a land she hadn't seen in months.  
听到熟悉的母语，明日香发出了一声欢快的尖叫，随即开始向这位红眼的新来者询问她已数月未见的故乡情况。

Though behind the ear to ear grin she wore there was a nagging sense of unease in the back of her mind as her logic asked why she'd never seen this grey-haired boy at NERV's 3rd Branch in Germany, but that was easily rationalized away as well by Asuka's knowledge that NERV loved its secrets, redundancies, and parallel programs.  
尽管她脸上挂着灿烂的笑容，但内心深处却隐隐感到不安，她的理智在问自己为何从未在德国 NERV 第三支部见过这个灰发男孩，但这一点很快也被明日香对 NERV 喜欢保密、冗余和并行项目的了解所合理化。

It wasn't long before Shinji was completely lost, catching only a word here or there but without any context to get a feel for what they were talking about, though someone did notice his consternation.  
不久，真嗣就完全跟不上了，只能偶尔捕捉到一两个单词，却没有任何上下文来理解他们在谈论什么，不过有人注意到了他的困惑。

"You must feel so left out." Kaworu said as he turned to regard Shinji.  
"你一定觉得很被冷落吧。" 渚薰说着转向真嗣。

"It's the baka's fault he isn't bilingual!" Asuka interjected, though did switch to Japanese for Shinji's benefit, if it could be called that.  
"谁叫那笨蛋不是双语的！" 明日香插话道，尽管她确实为了真嗣的缘故切换到了日语，如果那能称之为照顾的话。

Shinji in response merely laughed and scratched the back of his head. Though as his eyes opened he noticed how long the shadows on the ground had become:  
真嗣只是笑了笑，挠了挠后脑勺。然而，当他睁开眼睛时，他注意到地上的影子已经变得多么长了：

"It's getting late." Shinji began, mulling over in his head what he wanted to say next before deciding to do so: "How'd you like to come over to our apartment for dinner Kaworu."  
"天色已晚。" 真嗣开口说道，他在脑海中反复斟酌着接下来想说的话，最终决定说出口："你想来我们公寓吃晚饭吗，薰。"

"I'd like that." Kaworu answered simply before the trio walked off.  
"我很乐意。" 薰简单地回答后，三人便一同离开了。

They made their way back to the apartment through the failing light of the latest day in Tokyo-3, the smiles and laughter of the secret lovers belying their earlier turmoil as their hearts were put at ease.  
他们穿过东京-3 日渐黯淡的暮色，返回公寓。这对秘密恋人的笑容和笑声掩盖了他们先前的纷扰，随着心情的平复，心也安定了下来。

Once back the resident chef determined the only thing he could make with the contents of the pantry and fridge, that was appropriate for guests at least, was fried tofu with steamed rice and vegetables. Shinji would have been happy to prepare the meal by himself and let Asuka and Kaworu keep speaking in German, but the two of them had other plans and instead joined him in the kitchen. With three sets of hands the cooking went by swiftly especially since Kaworu appeared so preternaturally adept with a knife that both of them stood in awe as he perfectly julienned carrots and cabbage.  
回到家中，主厨决定唯一能用 pantry 和冰箱里的食材为客人准备的食物，至少是合适的，就是炸豆腐配蒸米饭和蔬菜。真嗣本可以独自准备这顿饭，让明日香和薰继续用德语交谈，但两人另有打算，于是加入了厨房。三双手一起，烹饪进展迅速，尤其是薰似乎对刀具异常熟练，他们俩都站在一旁惊叹地看着他完美地将胡萝卜和卷心菜切成细条。

Just as the steaming plates of food were placed on the table the three sets of ears heard the telltale screeching of tires and careening of metal that told at least two of those sets that Misato was home after parking her Alpine in the loosest possible definition of the word.  
就在热腾腾的饭菜摆上桌时，三双耳朵听到了轮胎尖锐的摩擦声和金属的碰撞声，至少其中两双耳朵知道这是美里在用最宽松的定义停好她的阿尔派后回家的信号。

"I'm home." The NERV Major said wearily as she crossed the threshold with downcast eyes.  
“我回来了。”NERV 少校疲惫地说道，她低垂着眼睛跨过门槛。

"Welcome home Misato!" The secret lovers said in unison from the kitchen, their cheery voices causing their guardian to perk her ears up.  
"欢迎回家，美里！" 厨房里传来这对秘密恋人的齐声问候，他们欢快的声音让他们的监护人耳朵一振。

Curiosity drove her feet forward until she reached the kitchen table, food spread out and a cold Yebisu already open at her usual spot.  
好奇心驱使她向前走去，直到她来到餐桌前，食物摆满桌面，她常坐的位置上已经开好了一瓶冰镇的 Yebisu 啤酒。

"Hello Major Katsuragi, I'm Kaworu Nagisa, Nagisa of the seashore, the Fifth Child." A red-eyed, grey haired boy she'd never met said to her.  
"您好，葛城美里少校，我是渚薰，海边的渚，第五适格者。" 一个她从未见过的红眼灰发男孩对她说道。

Her brain gradually processed the words, the grey matter pulling up a flash of the transfer papers that had crossed her desk some days ago:  
她的脑海逐渐处理着这些话语，灰质记忆中闪现出几天前曾经过她办公桌的调令文件：

"This…This isn't how I expected to meet you," Misato began, before a smile crept onto her face after she saw the looks in Shinji and Asuka's eyes. "But I am glad to meet you." The NERV Major said as she sat down.  
“这……这不是我预想中与你相遇的方式，”美里开口道，随即在她看到真嗣和明日香的眼神后，笑容悄然爬上她的脸庞。“但我很高兴见到你。”这位 NERV 的少校说着坐了下来。

About three beers later she was caught up fully with how the three of them had become acquainted. She should have been more cautious, but she was too glad her wards were doing better to let the nagging suspicion take root.  
大约三杯啤酒过后，她完全了解了他们三人相识的经过。她本该更加谨慎，但看到她的孩子们状况好转，她太过欣慰，以至于那隐约的疑虑未能扎根。

"I still can't believe they put you in the Geofront apartments, doesn't sound very homey." Misato said as she put her chopsticks down on an empty plate, her mind remembering the tiny rooms the NERV bureaucrats wanted to stick Shinji when he first arrived.  
"我还是不敢相信他们把你安排在 Geofront 的公寓里，听起来一点也不温馨。" 美里放下筷子，目光落在空盘子上，脑海中浮现出 NERV 官僚最初想让真嗣入住的那些狭小房间。

"Anywhere can be a home, a place to return." Kaworu answered though qualified it a moment later, "But seeing the happiness here in your home makes me think there may be more to it than four walls and a ceiling."  
"任何地方都可以成为家，一个可以回归的地方。" 薰回答道，但随即又补充说，"但看到你家中洋溢的幸福，让我觉得这不仅仅是由四面墙和天花板构成的。"

"You better not be thinking about having more pilots live with you Misato!" Asuka interjected "The place is cramped enough with this dummkopf!" She added as she elbowed a seated Shinji with her left elbow. "No offense though." Asuka added with a smile to Kaworu who nodded understandingly.  
"你最好别想着让更多驾驶员和你一起住，美里！" 明日香插话道，"这个地方已经够挤了，再加上这个笨蛋！" 她用左肘轻碰了一下坐着的真嗣。"不过，没有冒犯你的意思。" 明日香对薰微笑着补充道，薰则理解地点了点头。

"Well Rei has room doesn't she?" Shinji suggested as his right foot went over Asuka's left, toes intertwining with each other for the fourth time that evening.  
“丽不是有房间吗？”真嗣提议道，他的右脚跨过明日香的左脚，脚趾第四次在那晚缠绕在一起。

"The commander would never agree to that!" The purple-head said as she nearly choked on her latest Yebisu.  
“司令绝不会同意的！”紫发少女说着，差点被刚喝下的惠比寿啤酒呛到。

The moment of joy however was soon ended though as mention of the First Child brought forth memories of what the three of them had seen in Terminal Dogma  
然而，这份欢乐的瞬间很快就被打破了，当提到第一适格者时，三人脑海中浮现出他们在终端教条所见的一切。

"Pilot Ayanami?" Kaworu began, either not noticing their dejected expressions or choosing not to acknowledge them as he continued: "I'm quite eager to meet her as well."  
"绫波零驾驶员？" 渚薰开始说道，似乎没有注意到他们沮丧的表情，或者选择不去理会，继续说道："我也很期待见到她。"

"Well you'll see her at the synch test tomorrow for sure." Misato said as she swirled the malty brew in her can.  
"明天同步测试你肯定会见到她的。" 美里说着，摇晃着罐中的麦芽啤酒。"

There was silence for a moment before it was broken by Misato's phone. A curse under her breath as she looked at the number…and then the time:  
沉默了一会儿，直到被美里的手机铃声打破。她低声咒骂着，看着来电号码……然后是时间：

"It is rather late isn't it." Kaworu said, almost as if he had read Misato's thoughts, which normally would have unnerved the Major had her mind not been pre-occupied with all the various reasons why this number would call.  
"已经很晚了，不是吗？" 渚薰说道，仿佛读懂了美里心中的想法，这种情况通常会让美里感到不安，但此刻她的心思全被这个来电的各种可能性所占据。

"Haha, yeah" Misato began as she got up from the table before continuing: "I didn't realize how late it was, Kaworu, I've got to take this but did you want me to call Section 2 for an escort to the Geofront?"  
"哈哈，是啊。" 美里一边说着，一边从桌旁站起身来，继续道："我没意识到已经这么晚了，渚薰，我得接这个电话，不过你需要我叫第二分部派人来护送你去地底吗？"

"That won't be necessary Major Katsuragi." The grey haired boy answered simply as he got up as well, "I'll be on my way now."  
"那就不必了，葛城少校。" 灰发的少年简单地回答，同时站起身来，"我现在就出发。"

"Alright, if you're sure." Misato said with uncertainty as she hurried to her room and the privacy it offered.  
"好吧，如果你确定的话。" 美里带着不确定的语气，急忙走向自己的房间，寻求那里的私密空间。

"Hyuga." Misato said into the speaker once the door was closed and the scrambling encryption Maya had added to her device to prevent eavesdropping by any of NERV's Magi was activated. She still didn't like to use it though, but right now there wasn't much choice.  
"日向。" 美里在门关闭后对着话筒说道，随即启动了摩耶为她设备添加的加密程序，以防 NERV 的 MAGI 系统窃听。尽管如此，她仍不喜欢使用这种方式，但眼下别无选择。

"I've found where they are keeping Ritsuko." The bespeckled lieutenant said over the line in a hushed tone.  
"我已经找到了他们关押律子的地点。" 戴着眼镜的日向少尉在电话那头压低声音说道。

Meanwhile, after helping place the dirty dishes in the sink to be cleaned later Kaworu made his way to the hallway before turning to regard the couple behind him.  
与此同时，在帮忙将脏盘子放入水槽待稍后清洗后，渚薰走向走廊，转身看向身后的两人。

"Here you go." Shinji began as he held out a tightly packed plastic bag with Tupperware within: "It's some leftovers from today."  
“给。”真嗣说着，递出一个装得满满的塑料袋，里面是保鲜盒：“这是今天的剩菜。”

"His cooking's not terrible." Asuka said indifferently before she remembered something: "Oh here!" She exclaimed as her hands produced a small booklet from her shorts' pocket. "I know how difficult Japanese can be so I figure this might be useful." She said as she proffered Kaworu a German-Japanese Pocket Dictionary she'd picked up in Heidelberg. While Kaworu had spoken almost perfect Japanese in their conversations that evening Asuka had noticed that sometimes his word choice was strange, 'Lilin' kept standing out in her mind in that regard. She shrugged and assumed he had merely misremembered.  
“他的厨艺还不算太糟。”明日香冷淡地说道，随即想起了什么：“哦，对了！”她惊呼一声，从短裤口袋里掏出一本小册子。“我知道日语有多难，所以我觉得这可能会有用。”她边说边递给渚薰一本在海德堡买的德日袖珍词典。尽管当晚渚薰的日语说得几乎完美无瑕，但明日香注意到他有时用词古怪，“Lilin”这个词一直在她脑海中挥之不去。她耸耸肩，猜测他可能只是记错了。

"Thank you. Both of you." Kaworu said as he took the gifts, looking each of them in the eye before his red orbs looked down at what he held: "Humans can never banish their loneliness for good, because being human means being alone. But the way out of that loneliness is to weave a path to the light together."  
"谢谢你们两位。" 渚薰接过礼物，目光在两人脸上停留片刻，随后红色眼眸垂下，凝视着手中的物品："人类永远无法彻底摆脱孤独，因为身为人类就意味着孤独。但走出孤独的道路，是共同编织向光的路径。"

The grey-haired boy's mystifying though vaguely familiar words spawned a look of puzzlement on the pilots' faces, followed quickly by smiles.  
灰发少年的话语神秘而隐约熟悉，令驾驶员们脸上浮现出困惑之色，随即迅速转为微笑。

"Goodbye." “再见。”

The door hissed shut as their new red-eyed friend began his solitary journey. The secret lovers hands found one another now they were on their own and cobalt and cerulean orbs stared into each other's depths.  
随着他们新结识的红眼朋友开始独自旅程，门轻轻合上。此刻，这对秘密恋人的手找到了彼此，深蓝与天蓝的眼眸深深凝视着对方的深处。

"I'm sorry I ran away." Shinji began, his cobalt orbs watery as he held both of Asuka's hands between them. Asuka shook her head animatedly before her halting voice responded:  
"对不起，我逃走了。" 真嗣开口道，他那蔚蓝的眼眸泛着泪光，双手紧握着明日香的手。明日香用力摇头，随后断断续续地回应：

"I shouldn't have tried…doing what I did."  
"我不该尝试……做那些事。"

'Weave a path to the light together.' Kaworu's words sounded in Shinji's mind as he let go of Asuka's hands and took her cheek in his palm. Their faces drawing together, cobalt and cerulean vanishing as their eyes closed, and their lips met in a jolt of lightning. Goosebumps covered both their bodies as they reveled in the catharsis that was this contact they had been missing. The gulf that had grown between them crashing back together with the force of continents colliding. Each drawing strength from the other to face the challenges of tomorrow.  
'共同编织通往光明的道路。' 渚薰的话语在真嗣心中响起，他松开明日香的手，手掌轻抚她的脸颊。两人的脸庞逐渐靠近，蔚蓝与天蓝的目光消失在闭上的眼睑后，他们的唇相遇，如同闪电般震撼。两人全身泛起鸡皮疙瘩，沉浸在这久违的接触所带来的宣泄之中。曾经横亘在他们之间的鸿沟，此刻以大陆碰撞般的强力重新汇聚。他们从彼此身上汲取力量，共同面对明天的挑战。

"Let's go to bed." Asuka said as the kiss ended, her hand rubbing up and down Shinji's arm as they made their way to her room and her much more comfortable bed.  
“我们上床睡觉吧。”接吻结束后，明日香说道，她的手在真嗣的胳膊上上下摩挲，两人一起走向她的房间，那里有她更舒适的床。

As they lay there beneath the blankets, the lovers holding each other in a lose embrace. Neither one noticed but for the first time in a long time their faces wore smiles as their eyelids fluttered and flitted as sleep gradual overtook them as they lay in each other's arms.  
他们躺在被子下，恋人们松松地拥抱着彼此。谁也没有注意到，但这是很久以来他们第一次脸上带着微笑，眼睑轻轻颤动，随着睡眠逐渐降临，他们躺在彼此的怀抱中。

**The Suzuhara Home: The next day  
铃原家：第二天**

"That new guy is something else huh?" Toji said to Shinji as he rummaged through his impressive movie collection. Hey, he and Kensuke had to have something in common after all.  
"那个新来的家伙真不简单，是吧？" 真嗣一边在令人印象深刻的电影收藏中翻找，一边对真嗣说道。嘿，他和健介总得有点共同爱好。

"Sure is." Shinji responded laconically in a manner that did not satisfy the Fourth Child in the slightest.  
"确实如此。" 真嗣简短地回应，语气丝毫没有让第四适格者感到满意。

"Better be sure he doesn't steal your girl." Toji's voice teased as his face turned from the shelves and the jock hiked his eyebrows in a suggestive manner.  
"最好确保他不会抢走你的女孩。" 剑介的声音带着调侃，他的脸从书架转向真嗣，挑眉做出暗示的表情。

"Right." Shinji said after a scoff as his eyes turned to the ceiling and his mind replaying the events at NERV earlier that day.  
“好吧。”真嗣嗤笑一声，目光转向天花板，脑海中回放着今天在 NERV 发生的事情。

_The five pilots had sat in submerged entry plugs attached to simulation bodies. The Fifth Child, Kaworu Nagisa effortlessly scored the highest scores ever recorded outside combat. The particular core seemingly making no difference as the testing staff shuffled through the various cores of the different Eva's to make sure the readings weren't an anomaly or glitch.  
五名驾驶员坐在浸入式插入栓中，连接着模拟身体。第五适格者，渚薰轻松创下了非实战记录的最高分。似乎核心的差异对他毫无影响，测试人员逐一更换不同 EVA 的核心，以确保读数并非异常或故障。_

_Afterwards Asuka had made a big show of being impressed with the new guy that bordered on the flirtatious, though when didn't it with her honestly.  
之后，明日香大张旗鼓地表现出对新人的赞赏，几乎到了挑逗的程度，不过说实话，她什么时候不是这样呢。_

_Though that had been the plan all along, Shinji had told his better half he needed to speak with Toji so Asuka figured she might as well put on a show and get some German practice in. Honestly, Shinji hadn't even thought about it; he trusted Asuka absolutely and besides Kaworu didn't seem like the type to try anything. Though he was sure that if he did Asuka would leave him with some broken fingers, like a few of the brave fools who had tried their luck in the weeks after Asuka's arrival.  
尽管这始终是计划的一部分，但真嗣告诉他的另一半他需要和冬二谈谈，所以明日香认为她不妨表演一番，顺便练习一下德语。说实话，真嗣甚至没考虑过这一点；他绝对信任明日香，而且渚看起来也不像是会尝试什么的人。不过他确信，如果渚真的有什么举动，明日香会让他留下几根断指，就像几周前明日香刚来时那些勇敢的傻瓜一样。_

_So, his redheaded lover had left with the grey-haired newcomer to walk around the parkways and paths of the Geofront. Well the ones that hadn't been wrecked by their battle with Zeruel that is.  
于是，他的红发恋人便与灰发新人一同离开，在 Geofront 的公园小径上散步。当然，那些没有被他们与 Zeruel 战斗破坏的地方。_

_Which left Shinji walking home with a track-suited jock enthusiastically informing him about all the drama and hijinks he and Sohryu had missed at school and deciding that they should hang out that afternoon.  
这使得真嗣与穿着运动服的运动员一起步行回家，后者热情地向他讲述他和惣流在学校错过的所有戏剧性事件和恶作剧，并决定那天下午他们应该一起出去玩。_

"Shin-man you wanna watch _Bikini Babes vs. Nuclear Zombies 4_ or _Robo-Titanicus and the Killer Eels_" Toji said, bringing Shinji back to the present, as he listed the two B, well really C-tier in the case of the former, movies he'd picked.  
"真嗣，你想看《比基尼美女大战核僵尸 4》还是《机械泰坦与杀手鳗鱼》？" 飞鸟说道，将真嗣拉回现实，他列举了两部 B 级，或者说前者实际上是 C 级的电影，这是他挑选的。

"I was actually hoping we could talk, Toji." Shinji said at length. This caused Toji's hands to lower the two 'films' he had been holding up. His tone bereft of humor as he asked:  
"其实我本来希望我们能谈谈，飞鸟。" 真嗣终于开口说道。这让飞鸟放下了他一直举着的两部'电影'。他的语气失去了幽默感，问道：

"Is she pregnant?" "她怀孕了吗？"

"What!? NO!" Shinji emphatically denied, the sheer brazenness of the question momentarily throwing off his entire train of thought.  
“什么！？不！” 真嗣断然否认，这个问题的大胆程度让他一时之间思绪全乱。

"Oh that's a relief!" Toji chuckled before carrying on: "Well that was the worst thing I could think of…Uh!...Not that that would be bad if you guys wanted that! It just is a bit early don't ya think?" Toji blurted out as he tried desperately to recover from putting his foot in his mouth. He gave a disarming chuckle but became unnerved a moment later when he realized Shinji wasn't laughing.  
“哦，那我就放心了！” 冬二笑道，接着说：“那可是我能想到的最糟糕的事……呃！……不是说你们要是想那样不好！只是觉得现在有点早，你不觉得吗？” 冬二急忙试图挽回自己说错的话。他尴尬地笑了笑，但随即感到不安，因为他发现真嗣并没有笑。

In fact his face wore a stern expression that told Toji this was serious.  
事实上，真嗣的脸上带着严肃的表情，这让冬二意识到这是认真的。

"Alright, let's hear it." Toji said, his tone matching Shinji's face as he sat down on the couch next to his friend.  
"好吧，说来听听。" 冬二说道，他的语气与真嗣脸上的表情如出一辙，他坐在朋友旁边的沙发上。

Shinji told Toji everything. Everything he, Asuka, and Misato had found out on their own. Everything he'd seen in Terminal Dogma, and been told by the missing faux-blonde. Toji sat there in silence, absorbing the information as Shinji finally got to the implication of it all. That the late Mrs. Suzuhara's soul must have been within Unit-03, specifically within the red core that Shinji destroyed.  
真嗣向冬二倾诉了一切。他和明日香、美里各自发现的所有事情。他在终端教条区所见的一切，以及从那位失踪的金发假小子那里听到的。冬二静静地坐在那里，吸收着这些信息，直到真嗣终于触及这一切的含义。即已故的铃原太太的灵魂一定在三号机内，具体来说，就在真嗣摧毁的那个红色核心中。

"I've been meaning to tell you for a while but…but…I'm sorry." Shinji said haltingly as his eyes fell to the floor and the tears he'd managed to hold back until now began forming under his tear ducts. As the first sobs began Shinji's voice was caught in his throat as he felt a firm hand on his shoulder. He'd expected shouting, anger, punches and like and fully thought their friendship would be over after making this confession.  
"我一直想告诉你很久了，但是……但是……对不起。" 真嗣断断续续地说道，他的目光落在地板上，泪水终于在他努力抑制之后开始在泪腺下形成。随着第一声抽泣，真嗣的声音哽咽在喉咙里，这时他感到一只坚定的手放在他的肩膀上。他本以为会有怒吼、愤怒、拳打脚踢，甚至认为他们的友谊会因为这次坦白而结束。

"My mother died long ago." Toji stated as Shinji brought his tear-stained eyes up to look at his friend.  
"我母亲很久以前就去世了。" 真嗣抬起泪眼朦胧的双眼望向朋友，说道。

"But…what I did is unforgiveable." Shinji's tone filled with incredulity at his friend's words.  
"但……我所做的是不可原谅的。" 真嗣对他的朋友的话感到难以置信，语气中充满了疑惑。

"You couldn't have known!" Toji proclaimed as he shook his head: "And if what you're saying is true all the rest of their mothers are trapped there! Kensuke's! Yours! Asuka's…Hikari's…" Toji's voice became low as he said the last name his voice letting out a light sob before continuing: "You've gotta promise me you won't give up! There's no time to wallow in pity! Not if we're going to get them out!"  
"你不可能知道！" 冬二大声宣布，摇着头："而且如果你说的是真的，那么其他所有人的母亲也都被困在那里！健介的！你的！明日香的……光……" 冬二在说出最后一个名字时，声音变得低沉，带着一丝哽咽，随后继续道："你得答应我，不要放弃！我们没有时间沉溺于自怜之中！如果我们想要救她们出来，就不能浪费时间！"

Shinji saw the determination in his friend's dark eyes and felt the desperation of his grasp as both of Toji's hands that were gripping his shoulders shook as the track-suited jock fought to keep control of the swirling emotions inside him. He looked away and down at his hand, clenching and unclenching.  
真嗣从朋友深邃的眼眸中看到了决心，感受到了他紧握自己肩膀的双手的绝望颤抖，这位身着运动服的运动员正努力控制着内心翻涌的情绪。他移开视线，低头看着自己握紧又松开的手。

"It might not even be possible." Shinji began before closing his eyes, letting out a breath, and filling himself with resolve he hadn't had in weeks brought his face up to look Toji in the eye again: "But I promise I won't give up." The usually macho jock brought Shinji into a tight hug as the two of them silently wondered what the future would bring.  
“这可能根本不可能。”真嗣开口说道，随即闭上眼睛，深吸一口气，重拾起数周未有的决心，抬起头再次直视着东治的眼睛：“但我保证我不会放弃。”平日里硬汉形象的东治紧紧抱住了真嗣，两人默默思索着未来会带来什么。

**Holding Cell: Undisclosed Location, Some Days Later  
拘留室：不明地点，数日后**

'God's in His Heaven, All's Right with the World.' NERV's motto sounded in Misato's mind as the blood red emblem shone on the wall. A moment later an overhead light revealed a faux-blonde languidly sitting in an uncomfortable looking wooden chair, her will as broken as her heart.  
“神在天堂，天下太平。”NERV 的座右铭在美里心中响起，墙上的血红色徽章闪耀着光芒。片刻后，一盏顶灯照亮了房间，一位金发仿若无力的女子慵懒地坐在一张看似不舒服的木椅上，她的意志如同破碎的心一般支离破碎。

"It's you again how surprising." Ritsuko Akagi said despondently.  
“又是你，真意外。”赤木律子沮丧地说道。

"I have a question for you." Major Katsuragi said guardedly.  
“我有个问题要问你。”葛城美里少校谨慎地说。

"Our conversation is being monitored you know." Ritsuko managed with some of her old snark.  
"我们的对话正在被监听，你知道的。" 律子带着几分往日的刻薄说道。

"I wouldn't be so sure about that." The NERV Major said as a twinge of guilt passed through her heart at the danger she'd put her friends, but especially Lieutenant Ibuki, in to accomplish that.  
"我可不那么确定。" NERV 的少校说道，心中掠过一丝愧疚，因为她为了达成目的，将她的朋友们，尤其是伊吹副官，置于了危险之中。

"Oh?" This information got the dour Ritsuko to show some life, "Planning something are we?"  
"哦？" 这个消息让阴沉的律子显露出一丝生气，"我们是在策划什么吗？"

Since Kaji had told her of the plots in the shadows Misato had tried to work within NERV to acquire solid evidence of just what was happening. To try and stop the old men's and Gendo's machinations before whatever they were plotting came to fruition. Their previous experience telling them it was best to work together they set about building up a web of support within the organization. A majority of the bridge crew and engineering departments had already been brought on. They'd especially gotten a boost to their numbers after the elder Suzuharas had discreetly informed many of their colleagues as to just what sort of secrets NERV had been keeping from the rank and file.  
自从加治告诉她那些暗中的阴谋后，美里便试图在 NERV 内部搜集确凿的证据，以期在那些老头子和碇的图谋得逞之前阻止他们。基于以往的经验，他们认为最好联手行动，于是开始在组织内部编织支持网。大部分的桥员和工程部门已经加入。尤其是在铃原家老夫妇私下向许多同事透露了 NERV 对普通成员隐瞒的秘密后，他们的队伍得到了显著增强。

But even all this clandestine support was not enough, not even Maya, Ritsuko's protégé had access to the terminals and databases in Terminal Dogma, where if there was any proof of this vast conspiracy it would have to be. Misato could in theory try to be a maverick and hack into it on her own but that carried even more risks than this.  
然而，即便有这些秘密支持，也远远不够，甚至连理津子的得意门生真希波也无法接触到位于最终教条区的终端和数据库，那里若存在任何关于这一庞大阴谋的证据，必然藏匿其中。理论上，美里可以尝试独自闯入并破解，但那样做风险更大。

'If only I'd taken something then.' Misato thought as she remembered hurriedly shepherding her stricken wards out of Terminal Dogma in the aftermath of Dr. Akagi's revelations, thinking only of their welfare rather than the bigger picture.  
'如果当时我拿了些什么就好了。' 美里想起了在赤木博士揭露真相后，她急忙带领受伤的孩子们离开终端教义的情景，当时她只想着他们的安危，而没有考虑到大局。

So she had nothing except her own word of what she saw, which was enough for her colleagues and subordinates but not politicians and the public at large. Oh well no point kicking herself for that again.  
所以她除了自己的所见所闻之外，别无他物，这对她的同事和下属来说已经足够，但对政客和公众来说却远远不够。唉，再为此自责也没什么意义了。

"We need ironclad proof of what their plans are." Major Katsuragi said, her tone professional before it softened as Misato spoke to her former friend, "We need your codes, surely you have a backdoor into the Magi?"  
“我们需要确凿的证据来证明他们的计划。”葛城美里少校说道，她的语气专业，随后在与前友人美里交谈时语气柔和了下来，“我们需要你的代码，你肯定有进入 MAGI 的后门吧？”

"He's probably changed them all by now, even those, if I was there I could probably do something, but in here?" Ritsuko gloomily stated as her hands spread wide as if to encompass the dark cell she was in: "You might be able to blind him, but taking me out of this cage is something he would notice."  
"他现在可能已经把所有密码都换了，包括那些，如果我在那里，或许还能做些什么，但在这里呢？" 律子沮丧地说道，双手张开，仿佛要囊括她所处的黑暗牢房："你或许能让他暂时失明，但把我从这个笼子里救出去，他肯定会察觉到的。"

Misato cursed under her breath, they weren't ready to move that openly yet, so her mind went to a secondary reason she had come, a question she hoped to get an answer for, so all their effort to get this far wouldn't be in vain:  
美里低声咒骂，他们还没准备好这么公开行动，于是她的思绪转向了次要目的，一个她希望得到答案的问题，这样他们迄今为止的努力才不会白费：

"The Fifth Child, what is he?"  
"第五适格者，他到底是什么？"

"He's probably the last Angel."  
“他大概是最後一位天使了。”

**Tokyo-3 First Municipal Junior High School Roof: Lunchtime that same day  
东京-3 第一市立中学屋顶：同一天午餐时间**

Rei Ayanami, the First Child, and former pilot of Evangelion Unit-00, stood, her hands at her side staring at the same sight that occupied most of her attention those precious few days she actually attended school.  
绫波零，第一适格者，前初号机驾驶员，站在那里，双手垂在身侧，凝视着那片占据了她宝贵几天上学时间里大部分注意力的景象。

Her eyes drank in the drifting clouds, leaved branches swaying in the wind while songbirds chirped among the dense foliage of the grounds.  
她的目光沉浸在飘动的云朵中，树叶在风中摇曳，而鸣禽在茂密的树丛间啁啾。

Her introspective contemplation upon nature however was interrupted as she felt _**him**_ approach, even before he opened the door that led to the rooftop. She reluctantly turned her gaze to the entrance as the creaky metal parted and revealed grey hair and red eyes.  
然而，她对自然的沉思被他的到来打断了，甚至在推开通往屋顶的门之前，她就已经感觉到了他的接近。她不情愿地将目光转向入口，随着吱吱作响的金属门分开，灰色的头发和红色的眼睛显露出来。

"You're the First Child, aren't you? Rei Ayanami. So, both of us ended up in the same form as the Lilin while we inhabit this planet." Kaworu Nagisa surmised as he stood some three meters from her, his elbows arched out as his hands remained in his school uniforms pockets.  
“你是第一适格者，对吧？绫波零。看来，我们俩都以莉莉丝的形式存在于这个星球上。”渚薰站在离她约三米远的地方推测道，他的手肘向外弯曲，双手插在校服口袋里。

"Identify yourself?" Rei said. Her eyes narrowing instinctively.  
"报上名来？" 丽说道，她的眼睛本能地眯了起来。

"You are the same as I am." Kaworu answered enigmatically.  
"你我如出一辙。" 薰神秘地回答。

"No…I'm not." Rei denied as her hands balled into fists at her side.  
"不……我不是。" 丽否认道，她的双手在身侧紧握成拳。

"That may be true in a sense I suppose. Your heart is as delicate as the Lilins', so fragile like glass that you, like them, think life is nothing but pain and loneliness." Kaworu responded, had he been more than a facsimile of a Lilin he might have shrugged his shoulders as he spoke. "But if you wish you may call me Kaworu Nagisa, the name the Lilin have given me."  
"那或许在某种意义上是正确的吧。你的心如同莉莉丝般细腻，脆弱如玻璃，以至于你和她们一样，认为生命不过是痛苦与孤独。" 渚薰回答道，如果他不仅仅是莉莉丝的复制品，他可能会在说话时耸耸肩。"但如果你愿意，你可以叫我渚薰，这是莉莉丝们赋予我的名字。"

"Why are you here?" Rei said as her stance shifted, legs parting and moving and feet spaced so she could move if needed.  
"你为何在此？" 绫波零说着，她的站姿发生了变化，双腿分开，脚步移动，以便在需要时能够迅速行动。

"It is fortunate that the Lilin cannot see AT fields as we do." Kaworu said rather than answering as his eyes looked down at the roof while his less human sense peered through the steel and concrete, finding the two he was looking for before continuing: "Otherwise he would have seen through your ruse, by seeing the worry that deceit has left etched in your soul."  
"幸运的是，莉莉丝们无法像我们一样看见 AT 力场。" 渚薰没有直接回答，而是目光低垂，凝视着屋顶，同时他那非人类的感知穿透了钢铁与混凝土，找到了他所寻找的两人，然后继续说道："否则，他早已看穿你的伪装，透过你的灵魂，看到因欺骗而留下的忧虑痕迹。"

The words made Rei's heart stop as her mind replayed what she had said after her confrontation with Arael:  
这些话让丽的心跳骤停，她的脑海中回放着与亚拉尔对峙后自己所说的话：

"_Commander, I…I…am functional."_  
“司令，我……我……能正常运作。”

"_Very good Rei." Gendo said, looking Rei over once more before giving her her next orders: "Report to Dr. Akagi for further testing."_  
“很好，丽。”源堂说道，再次审视了她一番，然后下达了她的下一个命令：“去赤木博士那里进行进一步的测试。”

"Be quiet!" Rei spat at angrily as her mind returned to the present.  
"安静！" 丽愤怒地呵斥道，思绪回到了现实。

"No one is watching us, or listening in, I am sure of that." Kaworu said nonchalantly as he turned his head from side to side.  
"我确信没有人监视我们，也没有人偷听。" 渚薰随意地说着，左右转头查看。

"_**Though if you are concerned we can converse like this."**_ Tabris, The Angel of Free Will, spoke into her mind causing Rei to wince and her hands to go to her temples.  
"不过，如果你担心的话，我们可以这样交流。" 自由意志的天使塔布里斯向她的心灵传话，让丽皱眉，双手不自觉地按住了太阳穴。

She had not yet fully recovered from the mental strain the battle with the 15th Angel had put her mind under, much less the attempted fusion that 16th had tried. So therefore her grey matter protested the strain such telepathic communication entailed.  
她尚未从与第 15 使徒战斗所造成的精神压力中完全恢复，更不用说第 16 使徒试图融合所带来的冲击。因此，她的大脑对这种心灵感应交流所造成的压力提出了抗议。

"I am sorry." Kaworu said as he reverted back to Lilin tongue. "The others were not gentle with you."  
“我很抱歉。”渚薰切换回人类的语言说道，“其他人对你并不温柔。”

Rei was unsure if he was genuine or not in his remorse as she clenched her teeth and forced the throbbing in her head to subside.  
绫波零不确定他是否真心感到懊悔，她紧咬牙关，努力压制住头部的阵阵疼痛。

"There they are now." The grey haired boy said as his othersight saw the swirling brightness of two AT fields draw together. "Just as vibrant as the one you call Leliel said."  
“他们现在在那儿。”灰发男孩说道，他的超视觉捕捉到了两股旋转的 AT 力场光芒汇聚在一起。“正如你所说的 Leliel 那样，生机勃勃。”

In the drab halls of the level below them two lovers, coming from different directions met and embraced in an empty corridor before holding hands and making the rest of the way together.  
在楼下单调的走廊里，两位来自不同方向的恋人相遇并拥抱在空荡的走廊中，随后手牵手一起走完了剩下的路。

Asuka was smiling from ear to ear as she looked at a glinting piece of metal in her other hand as the lovers arrived at a rather worse for wear door.  
当恋人们到达一扇破旧不堪的门前时，明日香满脸笑容地看着另一只手中闪闪发光的金属片。

She knew for a fact the key she held was the only one that would open the door. The clinking of the mechanism telling her the school had yet to change the lock on a door they hadn't had a key for in months. Though given the fact that the student population was much lower than anticipated between residents fleeing the Angels and the ongoing Baby Dearth this floor, and the storeroom she and Shinji now found themselves in was hardly ever used. Making it the perfect spot for what they intended to do.  
她确信手中这把钥匙是唯一能打开这扇门的。锁芯的咔嗒声告诉她，学校已经好几个月没有这扇门的钥匙了，却还没换锁。尽管考虑到学生人数远低于预期，居民因天使而逃离，以及持续的婴儿荒，这一层楼，以及她和真嗣现在所在的储藏室，几乎从未被使用过。这使得它成为他们打算做的事情的完美地点。

It also happened to be directly under where Rei was standing on the roof.  
而且，这里恰好位于丽站在屋顶正下方。

"Is this why you chose this spot?" Kaworu asked Rei, though his tone wasn't one of teasing but genuine curiosity.  
“你选择这个地方是因为这个吗？”薰问丽，尽管他的语气并非调侃，而是真正的疑惑。

Rei's cheeks reddened for one of the very few times in her life, the normal barriers she placed around her emotions failing as her haggard mind could not adequately compartmentalize them.  
这是丽一生中极少数脸颊泛红的时刻之一，她通常用来保护情感的屏障在疲惫的头脑无法充分分隔这些情感时失效了。

"No." Rei managed meekly though her and Kaworu's sight was still focused on the AT fields of the Lilin beneath them, the swirling intensity increasing in line with the lovers' heartbeats as their lips found each other again and again.  
“不。”丽怯生生地回应，尽管她和渚薰的视线仍聚焦在下方人类的 AT 力场上，那旋转的强度随着恋人们的心跳一次次增强，他们的唇瓣一次又一次地相触。

The storeroom was filled with the usual detritus and junk that every educational institution accumulated over its lifetime, but the only part of it of note to the two in it was the dusty table on the north wall.  
储藏室里堆满了每所学校在其生命周期中积累的常见杂物和废品，但对里面的两人来说，唯一引人注目的是北墙上的那张积满灰尘的桌子。

The German redhead's backside found this piece of furniture for a moment before her lover's arms lifted her up onto it. Asuka's hands went from caressing his face down his chest, feeling his slowly forming pectorals and stomach through his shirt before her fingers found the bulge in his trousers and the zipper that would free it.  
德国红发女孩的臀部在这件家具上短暂停留，随即被爱人的双臂托起，让她坐了上去。明日香的手从轻抚他的脸庞，滑过他的胸膛，隔着衬衫感受他逐渐成形的胸肌和腹部，直到手指触碰到他裤子的凸起处和那条将解放它的拉链。

Meanwhile, Shinji's own hands began to wander while their lips stayed joined, moving down her shoulders, giving her right breast a firm squeeze as his other hand went up her skirt and pulled down her panties, the striped fabric, damp with Asuka's lust, ending up crumpled around her left ankle.  
与此同时，真嗣的手也开始游走，尽管他们的嘴唇依然紧贴，他的手从她的肩膀滑下，用力捏了一下她的右乳，另一只手则伸进她的裙子里，拉下她的内裤，那条沾满明日香欲望的条纹布料，最终皱巴巴地缠绕在她的左脚踝上。

Their tongues stopped dueling in the other's mouths and both took in panting breaths as their foreheads rested against each other and cobalt orbs met cerulean blues.  
他们的舌头停止了在对方口中的缠斗，两人都急促地呼吸着，额头相抵，深蓝色的眼眸与天蓝色的目光交汇。

Asuka's right hand was wrapped around his warm, throbbing member just as Shinji's stroked the wet folds of her entrance. Wordlessly Shinji brought his body closer, her legs opening to accommodate him.  
明日香右手紧握着他温暖跳动的部位，而真嗣则轻抚着她湿润的入口。真嗣默默地贴近身体，她的双腿自然分开，为他让出空间。

He brought his right hand away from her most private place and wetted the tips of his fingers with his tongue, saliva and her juices mixing as he daubed them on his swollen cockhead before lining up his rod and plunging himself into her. Asuka's pearly outer lips slowing the shaft for a brief moment as they were dragged along, before releasing Shinji's cock and letting him hilt himself into her so that she could feel the teeth of his zipper on her ass.  
他将自己的右手从她最私密的地方移开，用舌头湿润指尖，唾液与她的体液混合，涂抹在他肿胀的龟头上，随后对准位置，猛地插入。明日香珍珠般的外唇短暂地阻碍了阴茎的进入，随即放松，任由真嗣深深插入，直到她能感受到他裤链的齿痕抵在她的臀部。

It'd been nearly two weeks since Asuka had felt this sense of fullness, of completeness, her arms wrapping around Shinji and bringing him in close as her body shuddered.  
距离明日香上次感受到这种充实和完整感，已经过去了近两周。她双臂环绕着真嗣，紧紧拥抱，身体因颤抖而紧绷。

Above them two sets of othersight saw Shinji and Asuka's AT fields merging to become one reciprocating the intertwining of their hearts and flesh.  
在他们上方，两组他心通视见了真嗣和明日香的 AT 力场融合，形成一体，呼应着他们心灵与肉体的交织。

"Then why are you here now?" Kaworu asked at length after Rei's denial.  
“那为什么你现在在这里？”在绫波否认之后，渚薰终于问道。

"Because…" Rei began, but couldn't find the words.  
“因为……”绫波开始说，却找不到合适的词句。

"Because you wish it was you beneath him?" Kaworu's words caused Rei to almost leap in surprise at the suggestion before recovering enough for a reply.  
"因为你希望在他身下的是你吗？" 渚薰的话语让绫波几乎惊跳起来，随后她恢复镇定，准备回应。

"That's not it…" Rei began.  
"不是那样的……" 绫波开始说道。

In the storeroom after the catharsis of the moment had passed, Shinji began his movements inside of her. His member began with slow strokes, easing her warm, wet insides into adjusting to his girth. Asuka's hands had moved under her knees as she lie on her back. Skirt scrunching up as Shinji's thrusts increased in their tempo eliciting moans from his redheaded lover before her teeth found her lip.  
在净化时刻过去后的储藏室里，真嗣开始在她体内动作。他的阳具缓缓抽动，让她温暖湿润的内壁适应他的粗细。明日香躺在背上，双手移到膝盖下。随着真嗣的冲刺加快，她的裙子皱起，红发恋人发出呻吟，随后她的牙齿咬住了嘴唇。

"Ikari…he is a kind, gentle soul, I don't want him to be hurt." Rei continued, her voice almost quivering.  
"碇君…他是个善良温柔的人，我不希望他受到伤害。" 绫继续说道，声音几乎在颤抖。

"And she would hurt him?" Tabris asked inquisitively as his gaze turned from the spectacle to the blue-haired girl.  
"她会伤害他吗？" 塔布里斯好奇地问道，他的目光从那场闹剧中转向了蓝发的女孩。

"All humans hurt each other sooner or later. Even if they don't realize it." Rei said as she tore her own eyes away from the swirling tempest that the lovers' AT fields had become up to meet Kaworu's piercing red spheres.  
"人类迟早会互相伤害，即使他们没有意识到。" 绫说道，她将自己的视线从那对恋人形成的 AT 力场风暴中移开，迎上了渚薰锐利的红色眼眸。

"But man, and I suppose woman as well," Kaworu added with a slight nod: "is able to forget from time to time, it's how they go on living." Tabris answered his eyes turning to the heavens as he continued: "Otherwise man would merely exist in his own loneliness."  
“但人类，我想女性也是如此，”渚薰微微点头补充道，“偶尔能够忘记，这是他们继续生活的方式。”塔布里斯回答，目光转向天空，继续说道：“否则，人只会孤独地存在。”

As Rei fumbled for an answer in the room beneath them Shinji and Asuka neared their crescendo. The German redhead's tight walls pressing around Shinji's rock-hard erection as that aching, burning sensation, built within her belly, though as it was it was Shinji who succumbed first, his panting stopped as his lips covered hers, smothering her in a kiss as deep as his twitching member as he came.  
在楼下房间里，绫波摸索着寻找答案的同时，真嗣和明日香正接近高潮。德国红发少女紧致的壁垒紧紧包裹着真嗣坚硬如石的勃起，那种痛苦而灼热的感觉在她腹中积累，然而正是真嗣先屈服了，他的喘息停止了，嘴唇覆盖住她的，深深地吻着她，就像他颤抖的成员一样，他射精了。

The spurts of hot viscous, liquid, coming in such rapid succession it felt more like a stream as he covered Asuka's insides with his seed, her mouth letting out a muffled moan as the spreading warmth brought Asuka to her own climax.  
那股热而粘稠的液体，如此迅速地接连喷射，感觉更像是一股细流，他将自己的种子覆盖在明日香的内壁上，她的嘴发出一声闷闷的呻吟，随着扩散的温暖，明日香也达到了自己的高潮。

Their arms brought them together in a tight embrace, lips still linked, the warm, wet breath of life from the other's nostrils condensing and mixing with the sweat on their faces as fingers curled in the ecstasy of the moment, causing wrinkles in their school uniforms.  
他们的手臂紧紧相拥，双唇依旧相连，彼此鼻息中的温热湿气与面颊上的汗水交融，手指在那一刻的狂喜中蜷曲，使得校服起了皱褶。

Though eventually and unfortunately reality returned as their lips parted and words came instead of passion:  
尽管最终，现实不情愿地回归，当他们的唇瓣分开，言语取代了激情：

"We have a synch-test today." Shinji said before he exited her, pulling some tissues out of his pocket and handing them to her, as he had done after all their 'pencil-sharpening' sessions.  
“我们今天有个同步测试。”真嗣说着，从她体内退出，从口袋里抽出几张纸巾递给她，就像每次‘削铅笔’后他都会做的那样。

"Yeah, guess we can just arrive early and wash up beforehand." Asuka said as she cleaned herself best as she could before she leapt off the desk and pulled up her panties.  
“嗯，看来我们可以早点到，提前洗个澡。”明日香边说边尽可能地清洁自己，然后从桌子上跳下来，提上了内裤。

Usually they tried to avoid this kind of bodily fluid exchange around synch-tests. But with Dr. Akagi gone the remaining testing staff had much less expertise in their examinations, not to mention the fact the Fifth Child would likely be far more interesting to them than any anomalies with her readings.  
通常他们尽量避免在同步测试期间进行这种体液交换。但自从赤木博士离开后，剩下的测试人员在检查方面缺乏专业知识，更不用说第五适格者对他们来说可能比她的读数异常更令人感兴趣。

"It should be fine." Shinji said as he patted the dust off the back of her school skirt, grabbing her ass as he was done.  
“应该没问题。”真嗣说着，拍掉了她校裙背面的灰尘，完事后还顺手捏了一下她的屁股。

"Pervert." Asuka said, her voice silky as her hands rested on his chest and she drew in for a soft kiss.  
"变态。" 明日香说道，声音柔滑如丝，她的双手轻放在他的胸前，随即倾身献上一个温柔的吻。

"Did you still want to try and talk to Rei today." Shinji asked as he cradled Asuka in his arms.  
"你今天还想试着和丽谈谈吗？" 真嗣问道，他怀抱着明日香。

"Yeah." Asuka said, the smile on her face dampening but still present. "We need to." Shinji nodded in response before pulling her into a tight hug.  
"嗯。" 明日香说，脸上的笑容虽有所减弱但依旧存在。"我们需要这么做。" 真嗣点头回应，然后将她紧紧拥入怀中。

As the lovers cleaned up and peered out the storeroom door checking if the coast was clear or not, above them on the roof, Kaworu's eyes suddenly glowered as they turned north to a location 1.6 kilometers away.  
当恋人们清理完毕，透过储藏室的门窥视外面是否安全时，在他们头顶的屋顶上，渚薰的目光突然变得锐利，转向北方 1.6 公里外的一个位置。

"Now there are eyes watching us." He said before heading back to the door he appeared from, leaving Rei alone on the roof again, her eyes returning to the picturesque landscape as the tumult of doubt swirled within her.  
“现在有人在监视我们。”他说完便回到他出现的门口，留下丽独自一人再次站在屋顶上，她的目光回到如画的风景中，内心的疑虑如漩涡般翻腾。

**The Eva cages: Later that day  
EVA 笼子：那天晚些时候**

Kaworu Nagisa, the Fifth Child, and Tabris the 17th Angel, one and the same stood in front of the imposing form of Evangelion Unit-02.  
渚薰，第五适格者，亦是第十七使徒塔布里斯，站在了威严的 EVA 二号机面前。

As his eyes, red as the mechanical behemoth before him, stared into its four his mind pondered why he was here.  
他那双如眼前机械巨兽般鲜红的眼睛凝视着它，心中思索着自己为何会在这里。

His ultimate goal was to reclaim this world for his kind, the Angels, or at least that is the name Lilin tongue had given his race, blessed with the Fruit of Life.  
他的终极目标是为他的同类——使徒，或者按照人类的说法，是被赋予了生命之果的种族——夺回这个世界。

But besides that he had wanted to see those particular Lilins' radiance with his own eyes, to see what it was like for them to exist on this world, a sort of microcosm for the whole species. The gulf between their happiness and the loneliness and sadness of the Firsts soul was another thing that had caught the attention of his late progeny. Or would they be siblings? Tabris wondered as he looked upon his hands. His Lilin hands, behind which resided Adam's soul, or at least the nearest thing.  
但除此之外，他渴望亲眼目睹那些特定莉莉丝的光辉，见证她们在这个世界上的存在，仿佛是整个种族的一个缩影。她们与初代灵魂的孤独与悲伤之间的鸿沟，也是他已故后裔所关注的另一件事。或者，她们会成为他的兄弟姐妹吗？Tabris 凝视着自己的双手，思索着。他的莉莉丝之手，背后寄宿着亚当的灵魂，或者至少是最接近的存在。

"Why though? Why this fascination?"  
“为什么呢？为何如此着迷？”

Was it merely to better annihilate the Lilin? Or perhaps to preserve some memorial of them so they might live on in the remembrance of his kin once the slate was wiped clean for the rightful owners of this world.  
仅仅是为了更有效地消灭莉莉丝吗？还是为了保存她们的记忆，以便在这个世界被重新洗牌后，她们能在他的族人心中留下永恒的纪念。

That endeavor had taken longer than expected.  
那项任务比预期耗时更长。

The old men, convinced in their deception, had been singularly impatient, but he would not be ordered, for he is Tabris, Angel of Free Will.  
那些老者自以为骗术高明，表现得异常急躁，但他不会任人摆布，因为他是塔布里斯，自由意志的天使。

Now though, in spite of this, the call within his soul could be ignored no longer, so he reached out his hand and bade Unit-02 to follow him as his feet tread upon the surface of the waters. And up above every klaxon pierced the calm and every shutter and bulkhead was sealed in frantic desperation.  
尽管如此，此刻他内心深处的呼唤已无法再被忽视，于是他伸出手，示意二号机跟随，他的脚步踏在水面上。而上方，每个警报器刺破了宁静，每一扇百叶窗和舱门都在慌乱中被紧急封闭。

But these feeble constructions were no match for an Eva, born from Adam but tethered to Lilin will to do battle. It seemed abhorrent to do so in Tabris's eyes for the Lilin to use something that had nearly destroyed them to be their salvation, as the red monstrosity broke through the Fourth Defensive Layer. Though as these thoughts played through his mind, above him, the only other such machine in the hemisphere activated.  
但这些脆弱的防御在 Eva 面前不堪一击，Eva 源自亚当，却受莉莉丝意志的束缚，投身战斗。在塔布里斯看来，莉莉丝利用几乎毁灭他们的存在来寻求救赎，这令人厌恶，因为那红色怪物已突破了第四防御层。尽管这些念头在他脑海中闪过，在他上方，半球内唯一另一台这样的机器启动了。

Shinji and Asuka had been in the respective locker rooms of their sex when the alarms had sounded, both already in their plugsuits they ran to the Eva cages. Picking up the gist of what was happening from scattered, hectic comms they had both made their way to Unit-01. The two of them jumping into and inserting the entry plug before the NERV staff could voice an objection. Asuka seated in Shinji's lap as four hands grasped the controls just as they had during their first sortie against the 6th Angel. A reprimand may have come from Central Dogma had Unit-01 not activated a moment later, the dual synch-ratio being higher than either of the pilots individual scores combined with time being an _exceedingly_ limiting factor caused Gendo to acquiesce:  
警报响起时，真嗣和明日香分别在男女更衣室里，两人都已穿上插入栓服，直奔 Eva 笼。从杂乱无章的通讯中大致了解情况后，他们各自赶往初号机。两人在 NERV 工作人员提出异议前跳入并插入插入栓。明日香坐在真嗣腿上，四只手紧握操纵杆，就像他们首次迎战第六使徒时那样。若非初号机随即启动，中央教条区或许会传来斥责，但由于双人同步率远超两位驾驶员单独时的总和，且时间极为紧迫，碇源堂只得默许：

"Under all circumstances the Last Angel must be prevented from entering Terminal Dogma." NERV's Supreme Commander ordered. "You know what failure means Pilot Sohryu." He added afterwards.  
"在任何情况下都必须阻止最后的使徒进入最终教条区。" NERV 最高指挥官命令道。"你知道失败的后果，碇司令。" 他随后补充道。

"Yes sir." Asuka responded, the image of the white giant she had seen weeks ago flashing before her eyes.  
"是，长官。" 明日香回应道，几周前她见到的那个白色巨人的影像在她眼前闪现。

"Shinji, Asuka…" Misato paused, clearly searching for words: "The Last Angel is…is…Kaworu."  
"真嗣，明日香……" 美里停顿了一下，显然在寻找合适的词句："最后的使徒是……是……渚薰。"

"That's a lie!" “那是谎言！”

"It's not possible!" “这不可能！”

The two secret lovers screamed as the truth of the angelic attack was revealed. Asuka's feet and Shinji's hands lashing out in fury and disbelief before Unit-01 began moving to begin its descent down Access Route 2.  
当天使袭击的真相被揭露时，这对秘密恋人尖叫起来。明日香的双脚和真嗣的双手在愤怒与不信中挥舞，随后初号机开始移动，准备沿着第二通道下降。

"They are late." Tabris said as he looked up, the faint outline of the purple mech appearing as it closed in before his Lilin ears heard words of hurt and anguish.  
"他们迟到了。" Tabris 抬头说道，紫色的机甲轮廓在他眼前逐渐清晰，Lilin 的耳朵随即捕捉到了痛苦与哀伤的话语。

"We let you in our home!" Asuka spat through anger gritted teeth.  
"我们让你进了家门！" 明日香咬牙切齿地怒斥道。

"You betrayed us!" Shinji snarled as his hands gripped the controls so hard his knuckles were white beneath his plugsuit.  
"你背叛了我们！" 真嗣咆哮着，双手紧握操纵杆，指节因用力过猛而在插入栓服下显得苍白。

"We thought we could trust you!" Both shouted in unison as they reached out Unit-01's arms to grasp the perfidious Angel.  
"我们以为可以信任你！" 两人齐声喊道，同时伸出初号机的手臂，试图抓住那个背信弃义的天使。

"I've been waiting for you both." Kaworu's voice sounded in the entry plug, though the pilots were unsure how as he had no radio or communication device.  
"我一直在等你们。" 真希波的声音在插入栓中响起，尽管两位驾驶员不确定他是如何做到的，因为他并没有无线电或其他通讯设备。

At that moment, Unit-02's hands, which had been poised protectively around Tabris, lunged up and grappled with Unit-01's as the three continued their descent.  
就在那一刻，二号机原本环绕着塔布里斯保护的手，突然向上伸出，与初号机的手紧紧相握，三者继续下坠。

Even with their dual synchronization and the power of Unit-01's S2 organ they were too evenly matched to overpower the bulging cloned flesh of the red behemoth. The two pilots shared a look and a nod with each other, Asuka whispering:  
即便拥有双重同步和零一机体的 S2 机关之力，他们也难以压倒那红色巨兽膨胀的克隆肉体。两位驾驶员互相对视并点头示意，明日香低声说道：

"Sorry Mama." As Unit-01 pulled out its progressive knife, though any momentary advantage this might have brought was negated by the four-eyed mech copying their moves and bringing out its own blade. The edges sparking between them as their left arms continued their struggle.  
“对不起，妈妈。”零一机体拔出其渐进刀，然而这一瞬的优势被那四眼机甲模仿了动作，同样亮出自己的刀刃。双方左臂持续较劲，刀锋间火花四溅。

"How are you doing this!?" Shinji asked through gritted teeth, his arm straining sympathetically with Unit-01's as their duel of blades was locked in a stalemate.  
“你怎么做到的！？”真嗣咬牙问道，他的手臂因零一机体的挣扎而感同身受，双方的刀刃对决陷入了僵局。

"Your Evas and I are composed of the same matter. Born from Adam. I can synchronize with it, as long as there is no dominate soul." Tabris answered.  
"你的 Eva 和我由相同的物质构成。源自亚当。只要没有主导灵魂，我就能与之同步。" 塔布里斯回答道。

"But isn't there!" Asuka demanded desperately, her heart sinking in worry as she thought of her mother within her precious Unit-02.  
"但不是有吗！" 明日香迫切地追问，心中因想到她珍爱的二号机内的母亲而忧虑下沉。

"It is taking quite a bit of effort to suppress the soul within Unit-02." Kaworu admitted, "But since it is merely a fragment, a singular impulse, rather than a complete personality, it is possible with enough will, and the power derived from the S2 organ it consumed."  
"压制二号机内的灵魂确实需要相当大的努力。" 渚薰承认道，"但由于那只是一个碎片，一个单一的冲动，而非完整的个性，只要有足够的意志，以及从它所吞噬的 S2 机关中获得的力量，这是可能的。"

This response threw Asuka into a fit of rage, her consciousness taking over the driver's seat for the moment. She directed Unit-01's right leg forward with pure fury into Unit-02's abdomen, causing her erstwhile red mech's grip on its progressive knife to loosen. Shinji took advantage of this momentary lapse to parry away his opponent's weapon, the knife burying itself in the wall and quickly passed by.  
这一回应让明日香怒火中烧，她的意识暂时占据了驾驶的主导。她操控着初号机的右腿，带着纯粹的愤怒猛击零号机的腹部，使得她那红色机甲对渐进刀的握持力有所松懈。真嗣趁此机会，将对手的武器格挡开，那把刀随即插入了墙壁并迅速掠过。

Both pilots then refocused their combined efforts, lunging their progressive knife past Unit-02's exposed guard towards its head. But the possessed red mech did the unexpected. It released its left hand from the grapple between them and millimeters before the blade would have impacted swatted away the purple mech's right arm with its left. Deflecting the blade straight toward Kaworu. Though rather than skewering the Last Angel, it was instead halted in place by the ominous, familiar form of an orange octagon.  
两位驾驶员随即重新集中精力，将渐进刀刺向零号机暴露的防御空隙，直指其头部。但被附身的红色机甲做出了意料之外的动作。它在刀刃即将触及的毫厘之际，松开了左手的纠缠，用左手猛地将紫色机甲的右臂拍开。刀刃被直接引向了渚薰，然而，并非刺穿这位最后的使徒，而是被一个不祥且熟悉的橙色八角形物体所阻挡。

"An AT Field!" The pilots said in unison at the sight.  
“AT 力场！”两位驾驶员异口同声地惊呼道。

"That's right. That's what you Lilin call it. The sacred domain where none may trespass. The light of the soul. Don't you Lilin know? That the AT Field is the wall that everyone has in their heart?" Kaworu monologed in response.  
“没错。这就是你们人类所谓的。神圣不可侵犯的领域。灵魂之光。你们人类难道不知道吗？AT 力场，是每个人心中都有的墙。”渚薰自言自语地回应道。

Though while Shinji and Asuka were distracted by the dazzling sight in front of them Unit-02 recovered and tackled Unit-01 into the shaft's side. The pilots' backs feeling every fragment of concrete and twisted bit of steel as the purple mech left a trail 200 meters long before they recovered their senses and stabbed their progressive knife, that they somehow managed to keep a grip on, into Unit-02's shoulder before bringing up both their legs to kick away the angelically controlled mech into the shafts other side.  
尽管真嗣和明日香被眼前的眩目光景分了心，二号机却趁机恢复了行动，将初号机撞向井壁。两位驾驶员的背部感受到每一块混凝土碎片和扭曲的钢材，紫色机体在恢复意识前留下了一条长达 200 米的痕迹，随后他们设法紧握手中的高振动粒子刀，刺入二号机的肩膀，同时抬起双腿将受天使控制的机体踢向井的另一侧。

Though Unit-02 was not dazed nearly as much as the pilots had been and charged out of the dust cloud of debris directly at the purple holder of Mankind's hopes.  
然而，二号机并未像驾驶员那样被震慑，它从碎石尘埃中冲出，直奔承载着人类希望的紫色机体。

However, Shinji and Asuka were ready, they directed Unit-01's left hand to block and then grasp the biomechanical arm that had lunged at them before spinning around, so that they held Unit-02's right arm behind its back in a hold. The pilots then again tried to plunge down their progressive knife into the back of the unmanned mech's cranium, but were stopped as a red forearm stopped their attack cold  
然而，真嗣和明日香已做好准备，他们指挥初号机的左手进行阻挡并抓住那只向他们袭来的生物机械臂，随后转身，将二号机的右臂反扣在背后。两位驾驶员随即试图将他们的渐进刀刺入无人驾驶机甲的后脑，但被一只红色的前臂冷冷地阻止了他们的攻击。

"Surely there must be a way to coexist!" Shinji asked as Unit-02 was stuck in their grip, not able to attack itself, but also stopping their own strike, leaving the battle once again at an impasse.  
“肯定有共存的方法吧！”真嗣问道，此时二号机被他们牢牢控制，既无法自我攻击，也阻止了他们自己的攻击，战斗再次陷入僵局。

"The children of the Fruit of Knowledge and the Fruit of Life cannot live in harmony, they are destined for conflict and strife. It is ingrained in their very natures, as unavoidable as the rising of the sun or receding of the tides." Tabris, stated, his tone carrying a hint of remorse in it as he watched the struggle before him.  
“知善恶果之子与生命果之子无法和谐共处，他们注定要冲突和争斗。这种宿命深植于他们的本性之中，如同太阳的升起或潮水的退去般不可避免。”塔布里斯说道，他的语气中带着一丝悔意，注视着面前的挣扎。

"This is bad! We're almost at the bottom!" Asuka said as she looked at the rapidly approaching pool beneath them.  
“这太糟糕了！我们快到底了！”明日香说道，她看着下方迅速逼近的水池。

"Damn!" Shinji responded as they wordlessly agreed to try and twist Unit-02 around so that the red mech would break their fall and end the deadlock they were in. But the four eyed behemoth would not budge that easily and as it was the thousands of tons of cloned flesh and armor both reached Terminal Dogma feet first, sending waves outward from the impact that collided with the pillars of salt around them.  
“该死！”真嗣回应道，他们无声地同意尝试扭转二号机，让红色巨人承受坠落冲击，结束这场僵局。但那四眼巨兽不会轻易屈服，当数千吨的克隆肉体和装甲同时抵达终端教条时，他们双脚着地，冲击波向外扩散，与周围的盐柱碰撞。

Before the foam and spume had even settled the strongest AT Field ever detected rippled out from Kaworu, shutting out every form communications and signals. Even down to the electrons that flowed in the wires from the stations at Central Dogma to the nuclear failsafe that surrounded the White Giant beyond Heaven's Door. Now Major Katsuragi couldn't even use that last resort even if she wanted to.  
泡沫和飞沫尚未平息，有史以来最强的 AT 力场从薰身上波动而出，切断了所有通信和信号，甚至包括从中央教条站流向天堂之门外白色巨人核安全装置的电子流。现在，葛城美里少校甚至无法使用那最后的手段，即使她想这么做。

The crash untangled the two Evas and left the dual-synched pilots stunned for a moment, the progressive knife lost, before their vision cleared to see a grey-haired form moving away from them among pillars of salt.  
撞击解开了两台 EVA 的纠缠，双人同步的驾驶员一时震惊，渐进之刃失落，待视线清晰时，只见一个灰发身影在盐柱间远离他们。

"You don't have to do this!"  
“你不必这么做！”

"Stop Kaworu!" “住手，薰！”

The pilots tried to reason with the Angel of Free Will as he levitated towards the last obstacle in the path of his destiny.  
飞行员们试图与自由意志的天使讲道理，只见他悬浮着朝命运之路上的最后一道障碍前进。

They gritted their teeth and clenched their hands around the controls to give chase, only to feel their movement halted by a weight around their ankle. Unit-02 had recovered and pulled with all its might, sending the purple mech splashing down again into the dead sea. The pilots barely getting Unit-01 to turn over before a red foot crashed into their sternum, rocking their entwined bodies in the entry plug.  
他们咬紧牙关，双手紧握操纵杆追赶，却感到脚踝被一股重力拖住，动弹不得。二号机已经恢复，全力拉扯，将紫色机甲再次拽入死海。飞行员们勉强让初号机翻转过来，紧接着一只红色机甲的脚重重踩在他们的胸骨上，冲击力让插入栓内的两人紧紧相拥的身体摇晃不已。

Though Shinji and Asuka managed to recover quick enough to bring up their arms and catch the red behemoth's foot before it could land a second blow. Both sets of jaws releasing a battle cry as they harnessed every ounce of power they could from Unit-01's S2 organ and hurled Unit-02 away. The red mech's back colliding with a nearby pillar of salt that, while it cracked at the strain, kept the Eva mostly upright.  
尽管真嗣和明日香迅速反应，及时抬起手臂抓住红色巨兽的脚，使其无法再次攻击。两人齐声发出战斗怒吼，从初号机的 S2 器官中汲取每一分力量，将二号机猛地抛开。红色机甲的背部撞上附近的盐柱，尽管因压力而裂开，但仍使机甲基本保持直立。

The pilots then moved faster than they ever had before, not giving Unit-02 any respite, their right hand formed a fist and collided with the four-eyed face of the puppet Evangelion. The shock of the blow so powerful that the weakened pillar couldn't withstand it, sending the red mech crashing through it and back into the briny sea.  
驾驶员们随即以超越以往任何时候的速度行动，不给二号机任何喘息之机，他们的右手紧握成拳，猛击向那四眼傀儡使徒的面庞。这一击的冲击力如此之大，以至于那本已脆弱的柱子无法承受，将红色机体撞穿并坠回咸涩的海中。

At this same time another AT Field, even stronger than the first that Tabris had forged, penetrated the barrier the Last Angel had made around Terminal Dogma, though was bereft of the blue blood pattern of other Angels, leaving the bridge crew even more confused as they waited helplessly in Central Dogma, seeing only that Heaven's Door had been opened and now nothing stood between the Last Angel and their utter destruction.  
与此同时，另一道比塔布里斯最初制造的更为强大的 AT 力场穿透了末日使徒围绕最终教条区所设的屏障，尽管它缺失了其他使徒所特有的蓝色血液图案，使得中央教条区的桥员们更加困惑，他们无助地等待着，只看到天堂之门已被打开，如今再无任何事物能阻挡末日使徒对他们彻底的毁灭。

"Adam, that from which we come. Must all who were born of Adam return to Adam? Even though it will destroy man?" Kaworu mused before realizing he had been deceived: "No! This is... Lilith? I understand now so that's it, Lilith, the Lilin!"  
“亚当，我们源自于他。是否所有由亚当所生者都必须回归亚当？即便这将毁灭人类？” 渚薰沉思后意识到自己被欺骗了：“不！这是……莉莉丝？我明白了，原来如此，莉莉丝，莉莉丝之子！”

While the 17th Angel had been contemplating what this means before the light of enlightenment finally broke upon him, Shinji and Asuka hadn't relented. They grabbed the now prone Unit-02 and holding one leg and arm twirled around three times, the centrifugal force launching the vessel of Kyoko Zeppelin Sohryu's maternal love head first at the Eva sized Heaven's Door. The collision, combined with Tabris's befuddlement was enough to break his strings of control, as well as break the hinges of the metal gate. Several thousand tons of metal and armor falling into the pool of LCL that surrounded Lilith.  
当第 17 使徒还在思索这意味着什么时，启迪之光终于照亮了他，但真嗣和明日香并未松懈。他们抓住已经倒地的初号机，一手一腿旋转三圈，利用离心力将承载着惣流·齐柏林·明日香之母爱的机体，头朝前猛掷向那扇与 EVA 等大的天堂之门。撞击加上塔布里斯的困惑，足以切断他的控制丝线，同时也破坏了金属大门的铰链。数千吨的金属与装甲随之坠入环绕莉莉丝的 LCL 池中。

The purple form of Unit-01 following soon thereafter, reaching out its hand and holding the 17th Angel in its grip.  
紧随其后，紫色的初号机形态迅速逼近，伸出巨手将第 17 使徒牢牢握住。

"Thank you, both of you. Asuka. Shinji. I wanted you to stop Unit 02. Otherwise, I may have survived a lot longer with her." Kaworu said as his AT Field lay shattered and his Lilin form defenseless.  
“谢谢你们，明日香，真嗣。我本希望你们能阻止初号机。否则，有她在，我可能会存活得更久。” 渚薰说道，他的 AT 力场已破碎，人类形态毫无防备。

"But why? Kaworu?" The pilots asked synchronously.  
"但为什么？薰？" 驾驶员们异口同声地问道。

"Because it's my destiny to continue to live even if it may result in the destruction of humanity. But I can also die here. Whether I live or die makes no real difference to me. Dying of your own will. That is the one and only absolute freedom there is." Kaworu said, as the nihilism overcame him.  
"因为我的命运就是继续生存，即便这可能导致人类的毁灭。但我也可以选择在此死去。无论生或死，对我来说并无实质差别。自愿赴死，那是唯一绝对的自由。" 薰说道，虚无主义的情绪笼罩了他。

"How can you say that!?" Asuka screamed the question.  
"你怎么能这么说！？" 明日香尖叫着质问。

"Everyone's life has meaning!" Shinji proclaimed through eyes that began to form tears.  
“每个人的生命都有意义！”真嗣透过开始泛起泪光的双眼宣称道。

"Then heed my last will and testament. Erase me from this world. If you don't, you will be the ones who are erased. Only one life form will be chosen to survive the time of destruction and be given a future. And you are not the beings who should die. Your people need the future. It's what the two of you live for." Kaworu's eyes drifting up as he tried to convince the two pilots of the necessity of what he asked of them. Eventually his crimson orbs met ruby spheres.  
“那么请听从我的遗愿。将我从这个世界抹去。如果不这样做，被抹去的将是你们。只有一种生命形式会被选中，在毁灭的时代中幸存并获得未来。而你们不是该消逝的存在。你们的人民需要未来。那正是你们为之而活的。”渚薰的目光飘向远方，试图说服两位驾驶员他所请求的必要性。最终，他那绯红的眸子与红宝石般的眼眸相遇。

"_**Thank you."**_ “谢谢。”

"_**You will die here."**_ Rei Ayanami, the avatar of Lilith's soul, Archenemy of the Offspring of Adam responded. Her power having grown exponentially in line with her proximity to her source.  
“你将在此死去。”作为莉莉丝灵魂化身的绫波零，亚当后裔的天敌回应道。随着她与源头的接近，她的力量呈指数级增长。

"_**I see now it is necessary, if not, their radiance and happiness will be extinguished…and I…do not wish that."**_  
"我现在明白了，这是必要的，否则他们的光芒和幸福将会熄灭……而我……不希望那样。"

"_**Why?"**_ "为什么？"

"_**Because in them I see that the wall surrounding all hearts has a gate whose key is love."**_  
"因为在他们身上，我看到了包围所有心灵的墙壁上有一扇门，而爱的钥匙可以打开它。"

"_**Hate and sadness can flow through it just as easily as love."**_  
"仇恨和悲伤同样可以轻易地通过它，就像爱一样。"

"_**Perhaps that is the price we pay. The future is in your hands."**_  
"或许这就是我们付出的代价。未来掌握在你手中。"

"I'm glad to have met you." Kaworu Nagisa's last words sounded in a way all he cherished could hear.  
"很高兴遇见你。" 渚薰的临终遗言，以一种他所珍视的一切都能听见的方式回响着。

Inside the entry plug one set of hands stopped shaking, deep breaths were taken into lungs, resolve stiffening.  
在插入栓内，一双颤抖的手停止了颤抖，深呼吸充盈肺腑，决心坚定。

"Shinji…let me do it." "真嗣…让我来吧。"

"Whaaa-?!" "什么——？！"

"You heard him. If we don't…stop him. Everyone will die." Asuka explained, trying to use cold, cruel logic while avoiding saying Kaworu's name as her fingers moved to curl around the controller.  
"你听到了。如果我们不…阻止他。所有人都会死。" 明日香解释道，试图用冷酷无情的逻辑来说服，同时避免提及渚薰的名字，她的手指移动着，紧紧握住了控制器。

"I…I can't let you be the one to do this." Shinji said haltingly as his own hand stopped her: "To shoulder this burden alone."  
"我……我不能让你独自承担这一切。" 真嗣结结巴巴地说着，他的手阻止了她："独自背负这个重担。"

Tear stained cobalt blues and cerulean orbs met one another and filled with the dread of inevitability before they closed, unable to bear the sight of what they were about to do.  
泪痕斑斑的钴蓝与天蓝眼眸相遇，充满了不可避免的恐惧，随后它们闭上了，无法承受即将发生的事情的景象。

Two right hands, one of red, one of blue held Unit-01's controls for what seemed like an eternity, until two fingers twitched, followed a moment later by a solitary splash in LCL a shade darker.  
两只右手，一只是红色，一只是蓝色，握住初号机的操纵杆，仿佛永恒般漫长，直到两根手指抽动，片刻后，LCL 中溅起了一抹更深的颜色。

**A/N:** Now Kaworu fans before you get your pitchforks and torches hear me out. I want to keep this fic as close as possible to established lore. And in that there is no way for humans and Angels to coexist. One must die. Sure I could do some hand wave bullshit to get Kaworu to live, I'm the author after all, but I also think that misses the point of Kaworu's character. The fact that Kaworu _chooses_ death, that he willingly sacrifices himself and his kind's future for the sake of Mankind, for Shinji's sake, _is_ the crucial part of his character. It would be like rewriting the Gospels in the Bible so that Jesus doesn't die on the Cross. The death itself, freely given for the salvation of others, is what is important.  
作者注：现在，Kaworu 的粉丝们在你们拿起草叉和火把之前，请听我说。我希望尽可能贴近已建立的背景故事。而在那之中，人类和使徒是无法共存的。必须有一方消亡。当然，我可以用一些牵强的理由让 Kaworu 活下来，毕竟我是作者，但我认为那会错过 Kaworu 这个角色的核心。Kaworu 选择死亡，他自愿为人类，为 Shinji 牺牲自己和同类的未来，这才是他角色的关键部分。这就像重写《圣经》中的福音书，让耶稣不在十字架上死去一样。重要的是，为了他人的救赎而自愿献出生命。

And after all, after the Crucifixion comes the Resurrection, no?  
毕竟，在十字架上的牺牲之后，不就是复活吗？

There are only two more chapters to go before this story wraps up. They'll be out when they're ready.  
这个故事只剩下两章就要结束了。它们会在准备好的时候发布。

Again sorry for the wait, I hope it was worth it, let me know.  
再次为等待致歉，希望它值得你等待，请告诉我你的想法。

### Chapter 16 End of ASG Part 116.

With Cruel and Merciless Intent  
怀着残忍与无情的意图

**Eva Cages: Some Days After the Destruction of the Last Angel  
伊娃·凯奇：最后一使徒毁灭后的某日**

---
The brown-haired boy's fist clenched and unclenched at his side.  
棕发少年的拳头在身侧紧握又松开。

'What should I do?' His mind asked as his cobalt eyes fixed on the girl's chest rising and falling gently in time with her breathing.  
“我该怎么办？”他的内心问道，深蓝色的眼睛紧盯着女孩随着呼吸轻轻起伏的胸口。

The room they found themselves in was dark and cool, a palpable dampness tickling his nose from the moist air.  
他们所在的房间昏暗而凉爽，潮湿的空气中，一股明显的湿气轻挠着他的鼻子。

Swallowing hard to steel himself, the boy took a step forward, then another and another until he was standing over her sleeping form. Taking a breath and filling his lungs with cool, humid air he reached out his hand.  
男孩硬着头皮，艰难地咽了咽，向前迈出一步，又一步，再一步，直到站在她沉睡的身体上方。他深吸一口气，让清凉湿润的空气充满肺部，然后伸出了手。

But before it could make contact, her eyes opened and piercing cerulean eyes met cobalt blues.  
但就在即将触碰之际，她的眼睛睁开了，锐利的蔚蓝眼眸与深邃的钴蓝对视。

"Hey." Asuka Langley Sohryu said weakly as she pulled Shinji Ikrari's outstretched hand to her shoulder. She closed her eyes as she felt the warmth of the brown-haired boy's touch even through the material of her plugsuit.  
"嘿。" 惣流·明日香·兰格雷虚弱地说道，她拉着碇真嗣伸出的手放在自己的肩膀上。她闭上眼睛，感受到棕发少年手指的温暖，即便隔着插入栓服的布料。

Unit-01, under the Supreme Commander's orders was being kept inactive. Leaving only the hastily repaired Unit-02 to be the single Eva unit on standby for the last several days NERV HQ had spent under lockdown. Which meant Asuka had spent almost every waking moment since then sitting in her entry plug. This time the German redhead hadn't even managed to change out of her plugsuit before collapsing onto a bench and falling asleep.  
初号机，根据总司令的命令被保持非活动状态。只剩下匆忙修复的二号机作为唯一待命的 EVA 单位，这是 NERV 总部在封锁期间度过的最后几天。这意味着明日香几乎自那时起每时每刻都坐在她的插入栓内。这次，这位德国红发少女甚至没来得及换下插入栓服，就倒在一旁的椅子上睡着了。

"Hey…" Shinji Ikari, her lover, said, trying to manage a smile but barely succeeding, "I brought food." He motioned his head to his other hand, water condensing on the plastic bag from the hot meal within the Styrofoam trays.  
"嘿…" 她的恋人碇真嗣说道，努力挤出一个微笑却几乎没能成功，"我带了食物。" 他示意另一只手，塑料袋上凝结的水珠来自里面热腾腾的泡沫塑料餐盒。

"Did they open the cafeteria?" Asuka asked as rubbed her eyes and sat up on the bench, hoping that the standby she had been on ever since Tabris breached headquarters was finally coming to an end.  
“他们开放食堂了吗？”明日香一边揉着眼睛，一边从长椅上坐起来，希望自从塔布里斯入侵总部以来她一直待命的状态终于要结束了。

"No, but this opens more doors than you'd think." Shinji answered, motioning to his NERV ID after he set the bag down and handed Asuka a Styrofoam bowl of soba noodles and her favorite soda.  
“没有，但这比你想象的能打开更多门。”真嗣回答道，他放下袋子后，示意自己的 NERV ID，然后递给明日香一碗荞麦面和她的最爱汽水。

Since NERV had not yet rescinded the alert condition from the battle with the Last Angel the normal operations of the cafeteria and its cooks had not yet resumed. Which meant most staff, including the pilots, had been living off instant noodles and whatever happened to be stocked in the vending machines for the better part of 48 hours. Thankfully, though the workers were absent the pantries were still stocked.  
由于 NERV 尚未解除与最后一使徒战斗后的警戒状态，食堂及其厨师的正常运作尚未恢复。这意味着大部分员工，包括驾驶员们，在过去 48 小时的大部分时间里都靠方便面和自动售货机里的存货度日。幸运的是，尽管工作人员不在，但食品储藏室仍然备有存货。

Asuka slurped up her noodles greedily, her stomach filled, and her body soothed by the warm broth. She'd nearly finished the bowl before Shinji had gotten even two bites into the fried rice he'd made for himself.  
明日香贪婪地吸溜着面条，温暖的汤汁填满了她的胃，抚慰了她的身体。在她几乎吃完整碗面之前，真嗣才吃了两口他自己做的炒饭。

"So…" Asuka began, the pause filled with the pop of her opening a cool can of soda, "What do you think will happen to us?" Shinji paused, his mouth chewing slowly and deliberately as his mind thought. He'd always known this question was coming on an intellectual basis but to actually hear the words…  
“所以……”明日香开口道，伴随着她打开一罐冰凉汽水的噗呲声，“你觉得我们会怎么样？”真嗣停了下来，慢慢地、有意识地咀嚼着，脑海中思考着。他一直知道这个问题迟早会来，但亲耳听到这些话……

Since the earliest days of their relationship, they had wondered and talked some about what would happen when the last Angel was beaten. There had been wild talk of parties, parades, and at last finally being able to bring their relationship out into the open without fear. But now that they were here neither of them felt a sense of elation.  
自从他们关系开始之初，他们就曾好奇并谈论过当最后一个使徒被击败后会发生什么。曾经有过疯狂的派对、游行的谈论，以及终于能够毫无畏惧地将他们的关系公之于众。但如今他们真的到了这一刻，两人都没有感到一丝喜悦。

"They might send you back to Germany, now that there's no Angels to fight." Shinji said at last his eyes staring at the screws of the next bench in the empty locker room, unable to look the German redhead in the eye as a long silence filled the dark, humid space.  
"他们可能会把你送回德国，既然现在已经没有使徒需要对抗了。" 真嗣终于说道，他的目光盯着空荡荡更衣室里旁边长椅上的螺丝，不敢直视那位德国红发女孩的眼睛，长时间的沉默填满了这个阴暗潮湿的空间。

"I don't want to leave." Asuka finally said from the shadow of her bangs, her tone serious. Shinji's face jumped up to hers as she continued: "If it comes to that I'll resign and find some university to enroll in, or maybe I can get residency through my grandmother." Her commitment conveyed by the intensity of her gaze.  
"我不想离开。" 明日香终于从她的刘海阴影中说道，语气严肃。真嗣的脸庞立刻转向她，她继续说道："如果真到了那一步，我会辞职并找所大学入学，或者也许我能通过我祖母获得居住权。" 她的决心通过她目光的强烈程度传达出来。

"You think they'd just let you stay for how many times we've stopped the Angels." Shinji complained despondently as he played with the last grains of rice in his tray, his eyes closing to stop tears as he remembered the smile on the grey-haired boy's face, just before the end.  
"你觉得他们会因为你我们阻止了多少次使徒就让你留下吗。" 真嗣沮丧地抱怨着，他摆弄着餐盘里最后的几粒米饭，闭上眼睛阻止泪水，回想起那个灰发男孩在结束前露出的微笑。

"I need to wash the dishes." He said, getting up and placing the empty trays in the bag before a hand reached out and grabbed his shoulder.  
"我得去洗碗了。" 他说着站起身，将空盘子放进袋子里，这时一只手伸出来抓住了他的肩膀。

"Stay a while…" Asuka pleaded. Silence filling the locker room as two battered hearts looked for the comfort they had so often found together.  
"再待一会儿吧…" 明日香恳求道。更衣室里一片寂静，两颗伤痕累累的心在寻找他们曾经常常共同找到的慰藉。

"…Okay." Shinji acquiesced as he placed the bag next to the bench and sat back down next to her. His hand was soon covered by hers, her thumb making circles on the back of his hand, while her other lifted up Shinji's chin, her soft lips connecting with his as both their eyes closed of their own accord.  
"…好吧。" 真嗣顺从地应道，将袋子放在长椅旁，重新坐回她身边。很快，他的手被她的手覆盖，她的拇指在他手背上画着圈，而另一只手则抬起真嗣的下巴，她柔软的唇与他相接，两人的眼睛不由自主地闭上了。

"Asuka!" Shinji hissed after the kiss had ended and a sense of logic returned: "Someone might see…"  
“明日香！”亲吻结束后，理智回归，真嗣低声说道，“可能会被人看见……”

"If it's over and we're private citizens and not pilots they hold no power over us." Asuka said, a bit of her old fire returning as she brought her leg over the bench so one was on each side and so that she could look directly at her brown-haired lover. "…and besides…" Asuka's voice returned to that tender tone of the pillow, "…after everything that's happened, I can't lose you too."  
“如果一切都结束了，我们不再是驾驶员，而是普通公民，他们就无权干涉我们。”明日香说道，她的旧日锋芒稍稍回归，她将腿跨过长椅，一边一条，这样她就能直视她那棕色头发的爱人。“……而且……”明日香的声音又回到了枕边那温柔的语调，“……经历了这么多，我不能再失去你了。”

Shinji could feel her arm shaking as it held onto him. Throughout headquarters everyone had been on full alert for days, and a palpable sense of dread, that this could be the end, filled the air even if no one dared put it into words.  
真嗣能感觉到她的手臂在颤抖，紧紧抓着他。在总部，每个人都已连续多日处于高度警戒状态，一种明显的末日感弥漫在空气中，尽管没有人敢用言语表达出来。

Images flashed before him as his eyelids came down. Scenes of crushed cores, crying friends and an abandoned child, bodies floating in LCL…the bloody hands of his Eva. All the pain of his life stabbing into his heart. He opened his eyes and stared into Asuka's cerulean blues and knew it was the same for her, but he saw something else too…  
画面在他闭上眼帘时闪现。破碎的核心，哭泣的朋友，被遗弃的孩子，漂浮在 LCL 中的躯体……他 Eva 那双沾满鲜血的手。一生中所有的痛苦刺入他的心脏。他睁开眼睛，凝视着明日香那湛蓝的双眸，知道她同样承受着这一切，但他还看到了别的……

'I must keep living.' '我必须活下去。'

Their arms wrapped around the other, their bodies pulling together as tight as possible as their lips joined for another deep kiss.  
他们的手臂紧紧环绕着对方，身体尽可能紧密地相拥，双唇再次深深相吻。

'Yes, so long as we have each other there is a reason to keep living.'  
“是的，只要我们彼此相伴，就有继续活下去的理由。”

One of lovers began using their tongue, the soft flesh moving back and forth along the interior of the other's lips. Reciprocation was quick in coming and soon the two squishy appendages were dancing together in their linked mouths as one kiss morphed into many. Shinji's hands darting across the advanced material of the plugsuit as they seemed to want to touch every part of Asuka's back. While the German redhead's own hands started on her lover's shoulders, massaging the tired muscle and bone around Shinji's neck and ruffling the collar of the white school shirt he was dressed in before her fingers moved lower and found that same shirt's buttons.  
其中一位恋人开始用舌头探索，柔软的肉体在对方的唇内来回移动。很快便有了回应，两条柔软的附肢在相连的口中翩翩起舞，一个吻转变成了无数个。真嗣的手在插入栓服的高级材料上穿梭，仿佛想要触碰明日香背部的每一寸。而德国红发少女的手则从恋人的肩膀开始，按摩着疲惫的肌肉和颈骨，拨弄着他白色校服衬衫的领口，随后手指下移，找到了衬衫的纽扣。

"Whaa…ait…" Shinji protested after Asuka had undone the third button, his pectorals visible to Asuka's glance as they rested their foreheads against one another, their lungs gulping down air in the brief respite.  
“等…等一下…”在明日香解开第三颗纽扣后，真嗣抗议道，他的胸肌在两人的额头相抵时展露无遗，他们的肺在短暂的喘息中大口呼吸着空气。

"It's just you and me." Asuka said as she grabbed Shinji's face, each hand holding one of Shinji's cheeks so she could face him towards her and stare deeply into those cobalt eyes she so loved.  
"只有你和我。" 明日香说着，双手抓住真嗣的脸颊，每只手都托住他的一侧脸庞，让他转向自己，深深凝视着她深爱的那双钴蓝色眼眸。

Misato probably had a hand in the fact that Shinji hadn't seen a soul in this level when he brought Asuka her food. The technicians, engineers and other personnel likely transferred to quick repair or maintenance of the Evas or conveniently also on a rest period. Though their sometimes guardian likely hadn't intended for the lovers to use the afforded privacy in such a manner.  
美里大概在背后做了手脚，确保真嗣给明日香送饭时，这一层空无一人。技术人员、工程师和其他人员可能都被调去紧急维修或维护 EVA，或者碰巧也在休息。尽管这位时常守护他们的女性可能并未料到，这对恋人会利用这份难得的隐私如此行事。

"Yeah…" Shinji answered as a smile formed on his face as his own hands moved up to Asuka's face, before his fingers rested on the zipper he knew was at the back of her neck.  
"嗯……" 真嗣回答道，脸上绽放出笑容，他的双手移向明日香的脸庞，手指停留在她后颈处他熟悉的拉链上。

"How did you know it was there? Hmm?" Asuka teased before bringing her lips to his ear, the moistness of her breath tickling his ears before she seductively whispered: "Did you remember from when you snuck that peak on the _Over the Rainbow_?"  
"你怎么知道它在哪里的？嗯？" 明日香逗弄道，随后将唇贴近他的耳边，温热的气息轻拂过他的耳廓，她魅惑地低语："是不是因为你偷偷瞥了一眼《彩虹之上》？"

"No, I remember it from when you shoved me in one and dragged me into the entry plug." Shinji responded with faux indignation before his teeth nibbled Asuka's ear lobe and parried: "Besides didn't you peep on me when I was changing too?"  
"不，我记得是因为你把我推进一个舱室，硬拉我进了驾驶舱。" 真嗣佯装愤慨地回应，随即轻咬明日香的耳垂，反驳道："再说了，你不是也偷看过我换衣服吗？"

Asuka's face went red as she remembered that. She'd known what genitalia looked like from anatomy classes, but she'd been curious what a real one looked like, even if it did belong to a baka. She hadn't entirely succeeded but had been sure he hadn't noticed.  
明日香的脸颊泛起红晕，回想起那件事。她从解剖课上知道生殖器的模样，但出于好奇，她想知道真实的模样，即便那属于一个笨蛋。虽然她并未完全得逞，但她确信他并未察觉。

"Your butt just looks so cute in it." Asuka said with a blush on a pouty face.  
"你的屁股穿那件衣服看起来真可爱。" 明日香带着微红的脸颊，噘嘴说道。

"Haha, you're more of a pervert than me, aren't you?" Shinji said through a laugh.  
"哈哈，你比我还要变态吧？" 真嗣笑着回应。

"As if you never stare at my ass when I'm in my plugsuit." Her retort laced with a chuckle.  
"好像你从没盯着我穿插入栓服时的屁股看一样。" 她的反驳中带着一丝笑意。

"It's not your ass I'm looking at." Shinji confessed, his eyes darting away from her cerulean blues.  
"我不是在看你的屁股。" 真嗣坦白道，目光从她湛蓝的眼睛上移开。

"Oh? What are you looking at then?" Asuka teased as she shook her bust.  
"哦？那你是在看什么？" 明日香调侃着，摇晃着她的胸部。

Shinji's hands went from around her shoulders and down to her legs taking meaty handfuls as he answered:  
真嗣的双手从她的肩膀滑落到双腿，抓起一大把肉，回答道：

"Your thighs just look really good in your plugsuit." He said as his eyes drunk in how well the red material accentuated the curves and forms that lay between Asuka's knees and her most private place.  
“你的紧身衣让你的大腿看起来真的很棒。”他边说边用目光贪婪地欣赏着红色材质如何凸显出从明日香膝盖到她最私密处之间的曲线和形态。

Shinji's eyes glazed over as lust from his lizard brain threatened to overwhelm his conscious thoughts as instinct told him females with wide hips were ideal for childbearing.  
真嗣的目光变得迷离，原始的欲望威胁着要淹没他的理智，本能告诉他，臀部宽阔的女性是生育的理想选择。

Asuka stood up from the bench, snapping Shinji back to reality, before turning around and sitting back down so now her back was facing Shinji.  
明日香从长椅上站起身，将真嗣拉回现实，然后转过身再次坐下，这次她的背对着真嗣。

"Can you help me or not?" Asuka asked her tone seeming harsh as she moved her flowing red locks to the side and exposed the plugsuit's zipper, but as she turned her head back to look at Shinji, he saw the smile on her face.  
“你能帮我吗？”明日香问道，语气听起来很严厉，她将飘逸的红发拨到一边，露出了插入栓服的拉链，但当她回头看向真嗣时，他看到了她脸上的微笑。

His hands seemingly moved on their own and soon Asuka's bare back was exposed, the material depressurizing as the German redhead worked to get her dexterous arms out of the plugsuit.  
他的手似乎自己动了起来，很快明日香赤裸的背部就暴露在外，德国红发女孩正努力将她灵巧的双臂从插入栓服中抽出，材料随着压力释放而松弛。

But just as the top half was off and crumpled up around her waist, she felt cool lips under her shoulder blade. Asuka's mouth released a gasp in surprise as a second kiss landed on her right shoulder just as her lover's strong arms wrapped around her stomach.  
但就在上半身脱下并皱成一团围在腰间时，她感觉到肩胛骨下有冰凉的嘴唇。明日香惊讶地倒吸一口气，紧接着右肩又落下一个吻，与此同时，爱人的强壮双臂环抱住了她的腹部。

This caused the German redhead to release a quiet moan in the cool, damp locker room, the sound seemingly echoing in the empty space.  
这使得德国红发少女在凉爽潮湿的更衣室里发出一声低沉的呻吟，声音似乎在空旷的空间中回荡。

"Asuka?" Shinji asked, seeking a reason for her unusually quick arousal.  
“明日香？”真嗣问道，试图寻找她异常迅速兴奋的原因。

"My skin's always really sensitive, right after I get out of a plugsuit." Asuka explained in a quiet voice as Shinji saw goosebumps form on her skin, and not from the chill.  
“我的皮肤总是特别敏感，刚从插入栓服里出来的时候。”明日香轻声解释道，真嗣注意到她皮肤上起了鸡皮疙瘩，并非因为寒冷。

'Sensitive you say?' Shinji turned the thought over in his mind as he got a devilish idea. His hands moved up from her stomach and up to Asuka's breasts, each grabbing handfuls of creamy flesh as he laced kisses from her shoulder up to her neck, burying his face in her luscious locks.  
‘敏感，你说？’ 真嗣在心中反复琢磨着这个念头，随即心生一计。他的双手从她的腹部向上移动，直至抓住明日香的双乳，每只手都握住了那柔软的肌肤，同时他的吻从她的肩膀一路向上，直至她的脖颈，将脸埋进她那迷人的发丝中。

Her breath hitched in her throat at the stimulation and her feet began tapping the ground in a vain attempt to stop her entire body from shuddering in the face of the onslaught.  
突如其来的刺激让她的呼吸一窒，脚尖不由自主地在地面上轻敲，徒劳地试图阻止全身在猛烈的攻势下颤抖。

The German redhead got a slight respite as Shinji turned her body around so now her front was facing towards him. But this momentary calm was shattered as Asuka felt warm lips suck on her left nipple, sending electricity surging up and down her spine and a moan escaping from her lips she wasn't sure even NERV's engineering could mask.  
这位德国红发少女得到了一丝喘息的机会，因为真嗣将她的身体转了过来，现在她的正面朝向他。但这份短暂的平静瞬间被打破，明日香感到温暖的唇吸吮着她的左乳头，一股电流沿着她的脊椎上下涌动，一声呻吟不由自主地从她的唇间逸出，她不确定 NERV 的工程技术是否能掩盖住这声音。

"Ba…ka…" She managed through gasps as Shinji's mouth redirected its attention to Asuka's right breast. His lips covering her areola while his tongue made circles around the ever rising and hardening nipples before furiously flicking the nub back and forth causing Asuka's lower lips to leak in arousal like Shinji had been licking her clit rather than a mere nipple.  
“笨…蛋…” 她喘息着说道，随着真嗣的嘴转移到了明日香的右乳上。他的唇覆盖着她的乳晕，舌头在逐渐挺立硬化的乳头上画着圈，然后猛烈地来回拨弄那小突起，使得明日香的下唇因兴奋而渗出液体，仿佛真嗣在舔舐她的阴蒂而非仅仅是乳头。

A squeaking sound soon joined the chorus of moans and slurps as Asuka rubbed those thighs that Shinji adored together as her nether regions burned with lust.  
随着明日香揉搓着真嗣所钟爱的那双大腿，她的下体因欲望而燃烧，一阵吱吱声很快加入了呻吟和吸吮的交响曲中。

Gathering all her will Asuka brought up her hands and grabbed Shinji's head, her fingers thoroughly ruffling his brown hair as she pushed his face away from her chest, so they were at eye level again.  
明日香集中所有意志，抬起双手抓住真嗣的头，手指彻底弄乱了他棕色的头发，将他的脸从她的胸前推开，使他们再次处于视线平齐的位置。

She saw a puzzled look in cobalt eyes as a strand of saliva fell from the corner of his mouth, landing who knows where, as a fresh flow of cool air caused her breasts to tingle from all the spit Shinji's ministrations had left.  
她看到他那双钴蓝色的眼睛里闪过一丝困惑，一丝唾液从他嘴角滑落，不知落在了何处，而一股新鲜的凉风又让她的乳房因真嗣的亲昵而留下的口水感到一阵酥麻。

He saw an intense look in the German redhead's cerulean blues, stern and foreboding and briefly wondered what he had done before they closed, and her lips rushed forward to cover his.  
他看到那位德国红发女孩的碧蓝眼眸中闪烁着强烈的光芒，严肃而令人敬畏，他短暂地思索着自己究竟做了什么，直到她的双唇紧闭，迅速覆盖上他的。

'No, not angry, horny.' Shinji realized halfway through the kiss as he felt Asuka's tongue burst into his mouth, subdue his, and claim the demesne for itself. All the while he was also aware of Asuka's hands frantically undoing the buttons of his school clothes and he belatedly helped her with the task.  
'不，不是生气，是欲火中烧。' 真嗣在亲吻中途意识到，当感受到明日香舌头的闯入，压制住他的，并宣称这片领地属于她自己时。与此同时，他也察觉到明日香正急切地解开他校服的扣子，他迟钝地帮着她完成这项任务。

In less than a minute Shinji was as dressed as the day he was born and Asuka's plugsuit lay in a rumpled mass on the dank, tiled floor.  
不到一分钟，真嗣便已穿戴整齐，仿佛刚出生时一般，而明日香的插入栓服则皱成一团，散落在潮湿的瓷砖地上。

The two lovers stared at the standing form of the other for a moment, their chests rising and falling as they took in deep panting breaths as the blood in both their bodies was boiling. But with testosterone and other hormones rushing through his body, and making up a worrying percentage of his blood, Shinji moved first.  
这对恋人凝视着对方的站立身影片刻，胸膛随着深沉的喘息起伏，两人的血液仿佛都在沸腾。然而，在睾丸激素和其他激素汹涌澎湃、占据了他血液中令人担忧的比例的情况下，真嗣率先行动了。

He did retain a semblance of reason though as he laid Asuka down on the locker room's wide bench rather than the cold floor.  
尽管如此，他还是保留了一丝理智，将明日香轻轻放在更衣室宽大的长椅上，而非冰冷的地板。

Shinji's hands spread Asuka's legs out wide and bared her most private place in all its glory before him. A quick dab of saliva, and Shinji wetted his throbbing cockhead and placed it at Asuka's entrance.  
真嗣的手将明日香的腿大大分开，让她最私密的地方毫无遮掩地展现在他面前。他迅速用唾液湿润了自己勃起的龟头，然后将它对准明日香的入口。

Her pussy had been left soaking by his earlier foreplay, so his member slid in without any resistance. As he hilted himself into her the German redhead's arms wrapped around his neck and shoulders, pulling Shinji into a deep kiss as he felt her walls close around his cock and Shinji grabbed those thighs, that he had spent hours of his life staring at, tight in order to maintain his balance atop her.  
她的蜜穴在之前的调情中已经湿润不已，所以他的肉棒毫无阻碍地滑入。当他完全插入时，这位德国红发女孩的手臂环绕在他的脖颈和肩膀上，将真嗣拉入一个深吻中，同时他感受到她的内壁紧裹着自己的阴茎，真嗣紧抓着那些他曾无数次凝视过的大腿，以保持在她上方的平衡。

Shinji began moving slowly at first, his member feeling more pressure now as Asuka's hole, which he now realized was both soaking and scorching, adapted to the familiar form within.  
真嗣开始缓慢移动，他的肉棒感受到更多的压力，因为明日香的穴道，他现在意识到既湿润又炽热，正在适应其中的熟悉形状。

Asuka's mouth desperately sought Shinji's in a hopeless attempt to preempt the moans building within her lungs as what felt like a hundred flaming butterflies flew around in her belly.  
明日香急切地寻找着真嗣的唇，绝望地试图在喉咙中即将爆发的呻吟前抢占先机，仿佛有上百只燃烧的蝴蝶在她腹中飞舞。

But she had already been so close just from Shinji's mouth and hands upon her breasts that it didn't take much for that final precipice to be crossed.  
但仅仅因为真嗣的唇和手在她胸前，她就已经如此接近高潮，以至于跨越那最后的顶点并不需要太多。

What finally pushed Asuka over the edge was Shinji's hands, in an attempt to get a better grip, sliding down her legs, his fingertips gliding over the incredibly sensitive flesh of her inner thigh barely a handsbreadth from where Shinji's cock had her labia split open.  
最终将明日香推向巅峰的是真嗣的手，为了更好地把握，沿着她的双腿滑下，他的指尖轻轻掠过她内大腿上极为敏感的肌肤，距离真嗣的阴茎将她的阴唇分开的地方仅一掌之遥。

The jolt of electricity sent shockwaves through her entire body and the German redhead broke the kiss, unwrapped her arms from around her lover, and pushed his torso away from her just as her lying form shook in ecstasy and a loud croaking moan filled the locker room.  
电流的冲击波席卷她全身，德国红发女孩断开了吻，松开环绕爱人的双臂，将他的身躯推离自己，就在她的身体因极乐而颤抖时，一声响亮的蛙鸣充斥了更衣室。

Shinji looked upon the entire incident with a jaw that seemed to want to scrape against the floor's cheap tile and a nose that if it wasn't bleeding already was damn close. Meanwhile Asuka's neck craned against the bench as her eyes rolled back into her head as the most intense orgasm in recent memory washed over her.  
真嗣目睹了整个事件，下巴仿佛要刮擦廉价地砖，鼻子若非已在流血，也差不多了。与此同时，明日香的脖子紧贴着长椅，眼睛翻白，最近记忆中最强烈的快感席卷而来。

Eventually, the shakes subsided, Asuka's pants died down, and her cerulean orbs opened to see her lover still on top of her.  
最终，颤抖平息，明日香的喘息渐弱，她那蔚蓝的眼眸睁开，看到爱人仍压在自己身上。

The almost grave look on her face turned into a smile he soon reciprocated as they stared into the other's eyes, the other's soul really.  
她脸上那近乎严肃的神情转瞬化作微笑，他也很快回应，两人凝视着彼此的眼睛，实则是对方的灵魂。

Shinji's head was resting, almost cradled, atop Asuka's knees as he resumed his thrusts into her. Long, deliberate strokes caused Asuka to bite her lip as the fire rekindled in her belly so soon after her last release. But Shinji managed barely a dozen of these strokes before Asuka put her own plan into motion.  
真嗣的头轻轻枕在明日香的膝上，他继续深入她的身体。长而有力的抽插让明日香咬紧了唇，体内的火焰在刚刚释放后又迅速重燃。但真嗣仅进行了十几次这样的动作，明日香便开始实施自己的计划。

On the last thrust, when Shinji's member had reached as deep as the laws of physics would allow, Asuka gripped his waist with her lithe hands and held his length inside her as she ground her hips against him in counterclockwise circles. The sheer pleasure this caused Shinji to feel made him close his eyes and his mouth to release a moan of his own as his shaft felt every wrinkle and nub of Asuka's pussy swirl around his cock. This caused the grin on Asuka's face to grow bigger still and her genius intellect to go into overdrive.  
在最后一次深入时，真嗣的阳具已达到物理极限，明日香用她纤细的手紧紧抓住他的腰，将他的长度固定在体内，同时以逆时针方向扭动臀部。这种纯粹的快感让真嗣闭上眼睛，张嘴发出呻吟，他的肉棒感受到明日香阴道内每一处皱褶和突起环绕其上。这让明日香脸上的笑容更加灿烂，她的天才头脑也进入了超速运转状态。

Just when Shinji managed to reassert some self-control and open his eyes to look at his lover, she stopped grinding herself against him and their eyes locked. Instead of resuming her motions or switching directions Asuka lifted her hips up at an acute angle, causing his member to scrape pleasantly across the ceiling, for lack of a better term, of her wet hole. The shaft and head passing every ridge until Shinji could just barely glimpse out of the corner of his eye the base of his cockhead peeking out.  
就在真嗣好不容易重新掌控了一些自我控制力，睁开眼睛看向他的爱人时，她停止了在他身上磨蹭，两人的目光紧紧锁在一起。阿斯卡没有继续她的动作或改变方向，而是将臀部抬高到一个锐角，使得他的那物在她湿润的洞穴顶端（姑且这么说）上刮擦，带来愉悦的感觉。他的柱身和头部掠过每一道脊线，直到真嗣用眼角余光勉强瞥见他的龟头根部露了出来。

He felt a chill go up his spine as the cool air contacted with the dampness her pussy had left on his shaft, eyes squinting as Shinji used a burst of willpower to remain in control.  
当他感觉到一股寒意沿着脊椎上升，冷风接触到她阴道留下的湿润在他的柱身上时，真嗣眯起眼睛，用一股意志力努力保持控制。

'Even when he's on top, he's like putty in my hands.' Asuka thought as her fingers reached up and softly pulled Shinji's face in for a kiss. The tenderness at odds with the previous intensity as his member slowly hilted itself into her again, radiating comfort through her tired body as she felt the familiar fullness within her.  
'即使他在上面，他也像我手中的橡皮泥一样。' 阿斯卡心想，她的手指伸上去轻轻拉近真嗣的脸颊，给了他一个吻。这份温柔与之前的激烈形成鲜明对比，他的那物缓缓再次深入她的体内，给她疲惫的身体带来熟悉的充实感，让她感到舒适。

Slowly that fullness began moving, haltingly at first before establishing a rhythm that fed the resurgent fire within the furnace that Asuka's insides felt like during sex. Their bodies pressing against the other as their arms were intertwined, just two people weaving the path of love.  
渐渐地，那种充实感开始移动，起初有些迟疑，随后建立起一种节奏，点燃了炉中重燃的火焰，就像爱抚时明日香体内的感觉。他们的身体紧贴着彼此，双臂交缠，只是两条生命在编织爱的路径。

Soon Asuka felt the telltale shift in Shinji's thrusts. The rhythmic strokes oscillating in their intensity before morphing into him thrusting into her as deep as he could as fast as he could that presaged climax.  
不久，明日香感受到了真嗣冲刺的变化。节奏性的抽插在强度上摇摆不定，随后转变为他尽可能深、尽可能快地插入她，预示着高潮的到来。

Asuka felt Shinji's member stop just millimeters from her cervix, before the nerves in her tight walls relayed a twitching feeling to her mind followed by a spreading gooey warmth that was the catalyst for Asuka's own peak as her body shuddered again beneath Shniji.  
明日香感觉到真嗣的阳具停在离她的子宫颈仅几毫米的地方，紧接着她紧致的壁内神经传递出一种抽搐感，随后是一股蔓延开来的温热，成为明日香自身巅峰的催化剂，她的身体在真嗣身下再次颤抖。

They stayed like that, holding each other tight for a long moment before a voice crackled over an intercom:  
他们就这样紧紧相拥，久久未动，直到对讲机里传来一阵沙哑的声音：

"Pilot Sohryu, ten minutes until next standby. Repeat ten minutes." A clearly tired Maya Ibuki relayed from Central Dogma.  
“飞行员惣流，十分钟后进入下一待命状态。重复，十分钟。”疲惫的伊吹玛雅从中央教条区传来指令。

"Fuck." Asuka cursed as Shinji withdrew his cock from her, the member streaked with their combined fluids, as she hurriedly stood up from the bench and ran towards the showers, droplets of white marking her path. She cleaned herself off and out in record time and as she exited the shower Shinji stood there with a fresh towel and plugsuit.  
“该死。”明日香咒骂着，当真嗣从她体内抽出那沾满两人体液的阴茎时，她匆忙从长椅上起身，跑向淋浴间，沿途留下点点白色痕迹。她以创纪录的速度清洗干净，走出淋浴间时，真嗣已拿着一条新毛巾和插电服等在那里。

"What do you want for dinner?" Shinji asked as Asuka got her right leg in the red suit.  
"晚饭想吃什么？" 真嗣问道，此时明日香正把右腿伸进红色驾驶服里。

"Is there any fish?" Asuka asked her arms found their place and she turned around.  
"有鱼吗？" 明日香一边问，一边找到袖子的位置并转过身来。

"No, but there is some chicken, so I could make schnitzel." Shinji said as he, without having to be asked, did up the zipper of Asuka's fresh red plugsuit.  
"没有鱼，但有些鸡肉，我可以做炸肉排。" 真嗣说着，不等明日香开口，便主动为她拉上了崭新红色插入栓服的拉链。

"Yum, that sounds great." Asuka's joy was punctuated by the sound of her plugsuit pressurizing as she depressed the stud on her wrist.  
"嗯，听起来真不错。" 明日香的声音中带着愉悦，她的驾驶服随着手腕上按钮的按下而开始增压。

"You'll have to live with kimchee and not sauerkraut." Shinji called out as Asuka bolted towards the exit.  
"你得习惯吃泡菜而不是酸菜。" 真嗣朝着明日香冲向出口的背影喊道。

"That's fine as long as you're the one to bring it again." Asuka replied with a wink, her face looking refreshed and content as she turned around to answer before continuing on to where a small army of NERV technicians and staff were waiting near her precious Unit-02.  
"只要还是你带来的就行。" 明日香眨了眨眼回答，她的脸上洋溢着清新和满足，转身回应后继续向她珍爱的二号机旁等待的一群 NERV 技术人员和工作人员走去。

Shinji sighed in response and began to get dressed himself before gathering up the trays, cleaning the most obvious traces of their rendezvous, and heading back towards the kitchen, leaving only one soul remaining in the locker room.  
真嗣叹了口气回应，随后开始自己穿衣服，收拾好托盘，清理掉他们幽会的明显痕迹，然后朝厨房走去，只留下更衣室里最后一个灵魂。

Because Asuka had not been entirely right when she said it had been only the two of them in the locker room. A pair of eyes that had a deep interest in the two lovers had been there as well, and not simply for this one escapade. These red orbs had been following and observing the pair for the better part of the week as the soul behind them searched for answers.  
因为明日香说只有他们俩在更衣室里并不完全正确。还有一双对这对恋人深感兴趣的眼睛在场，而且不仅仅是为了这一次的冒险。这些红色眼眸已经跟踪并观察了两人大半个星期，因为它们背后的灵魂在寻找答案。

'She would pick Ikari over her Eva?' Rei thought at the German redhead's answer, the gears of Ayanami's mind turning with this information. She'd always known it, somewhere in her subconscious but Asuka's words had thrust the thought into her waking, thinking mind.  
'她会选择碇而不是她的 Eva 吗？' 丽听到德国红发女孩的回答时心想，绫波的脑海中因为这个信息而转动着。她一直隐约知道这一点，潜意识里，但明日香的话将这个念头推入了她清醒思考的意识中。

"Take care of yourselves." Rei whispered as she turned to walk away, her decision made as the voice in her own mind added: 'For however long there is.'  
“照顾好自己。”丽低声说着，转身离去，心中那个声音补充道：‘无论还有多久。’

**Conference Room: Later That Day  
会议室：当天晚些时候**

"With the Lance of Longinus lost, Lilith cannot be our Instrumentality. Only Lilith's true offspring, Evangelion Unit-01, remains." Lorenz Keel Chairman of the Human Instrumentality Committee and Leader of SEELE told his gathered associates what they already knew.  
“随着朗基努斯之枪的遗失，莉莉丝无法成为我们的统一工具。只剩下莉莉丝真正的后代，初号机，还留存着。”人类补完委员会主席兼 SEELE 组织领导人洛伦兹·基尔向聚集的同僚们陈述了他们已知的事实。

"Ikari has used a Code 666 network protection on the Magi." The monolith labeled with a crimson 05 stated.  
"碇司令已对 MAGI 系统启用了 666 网络防护。"标有猩红数字 05 的巨石宣告道。

"That firewall will stand for the next sixty-two hours." SEELE's 04th associate stated based on the projections from NERV branches in Germany, America and China.  
"该防火墙将在接下来的六十二小时内持续生效。"SEELE 的第 4 号成员依据德国、美国和中国 NERV 分部的预测报告陈述道。

"More than enough time for him to enact his plan." The 03rd member said angrily, his distrust of Ikari confirmed. He'd always suspected Ikari was up to something but to brazenly refuse the transfer of Unit-01 meant he must be close to enacting whatever scenario he had in mind.  
"足够他实施计划的时间了。"第 3 号成员愤怒地说道，他对碇的猜疑得到了证实。他一直怀疑碇有所图谋，但如此公然拒绝移交初号机意味着他必定已接近实施其心中的计划。

"It seems force is our only avenue now. But therein lies a problem." The monolith emblazoned with 06 bemoaned. SEELE had originally sought to try to minimize the damage, if only because resources like the original Magi were priceless and may be needed in a future contingency.  
"看来武力是我们现在唯一的途径了。但这也带来了一个问题。" 刻有 06 的巨石哀叹道。SEELE 原本试图尽量减少损害，只因像原始 MAGI 这样的资源是无价之宝，可能在未来的紧急情况下需要。

"The Japanese Government is reluctant to order a full-scale attack on Tokyo-3." The 07th member lamented the one time in human history where politicians' selfishness and shortsightedness benefited Humanity's continued existence.  
"日本政府不愿对第三新东京市发动全面攻击。" 第 07 号成员哀叹这是人类历史上少有的时刻，政客的自私和短视反而有利于人类的持续存在。

They'd expended quite a lot of influence and pulled most of their strings in order to pull the wool over the Japanese's eyes and convince them that Gendo Ikari was up to no good. While that part was true, the powers that be in Tokyo-2 would eventually realize that the Committee was the same. This crisis had dug up too many questions and only the concurrent emergency of Gendo's insubordination was stopping serious inquiries.  
他们动用了相当大的影响力，拉动了大部分关系网，以蒙蔽日本人的眼睛，让他们相信碇源堂心怀不轨。虽然这一点是事实，但东京第二的掌权者最终会意识到委员会也是如此。这场危机引发了太多疑问，只有碇源堂的抗命同时发生的紧急情况才阻止了严肃的调查。

"Their worry about the unaffiliated civilian population in Tokyo-3 is exactly why Mankind has become stagnant, in need of death and rebirth." The 03rd member said in that tone reserved for angered fanatics.  
“他们对东京-3 非关联平民人口的担忧，正是人类停滞不前、需要死亡与重生的原因。”第三位成员以那种专属于愤怒狂热者的语气说道。

While the JSSDF and the government were willing to terminate NERV with extreme prejudice, their families and the million or so people just trying to get by were another matter. If only some cataclysm during the Angel War had depopulated the city, the JSSDF and their civilian masters may not have had such reservations  
尽管日本自卫队和政府愿意以极端手段终结 NERV，但他们的家人和那些只是努力谋生的百万民众则是另一回事。如果天使战争期间某个灾难性事件导致城市人口锐减，日本自卫队及其平民领导者或许就不会有这么多顾虑了。

"Not to mention the fact that Ikari still possesses two Evangelions with S2 organs, to which the JSSDF has no response." SEELE's 05th member pointed out what he deemed to be the real source of the military's hesitation, whose anti-Evangelion plans all revolved around severing an Eva's power cable and waiting for it to turn into a massively over-sized and over-priced paper weight. As it stood there was no weapon in their arsenal that could match a fully powered Eva and its AT field.  
“更不用说碇仍然拥有两台配备 S2 机关的 EVA，对此日本自卫队毫无对策。”SEELE 的第五位成员指出他认为军事犹豫的真正根源，他们的反 EVA 计划全都围绕着切断 EVA 的电源线并等待它变成一个超大超贵的累赘。就目前而言，他们没有任何武器能与全功率运行的 EVA 及其 AT 力场匹敌。

"Perhaps then we must fight fire with fire." SEELE's 05th associate said with a tone of impending menace.  
“或许我们得以火攻火。”SEELE 的第五位成员以一种即将带来威胁的语气说道。

"Explain." Lorenz Keel demanded.  
“解释。”洛伦兹·基尔要求道。

"The Eva Series." The black monolith answered pausing for a moment to let the weight of the suggestion fill the conference: "We send in the nine units that are ready, forcing Ikari to deploy Units-01 and 02."  
“EVA 系列。”黑色巨石回答，停顿片刻让这个提议的重量充斥会议室：“我们派出已准备就绪的九个单位，迫使碇司令部署 01 和 02 号机。”

"And the civilians into Tokyo-3's shelters." The 07th member said as he followed the logic of his associate's plan.  
"并将平民疏散至东京-3 的避难所。" 第 07 号成员顺着同伴的计划逻辑说道。

"The Mass Production models are all equipped with S2 drives, so they should be more than a match for the two in Tokyo-3." The 05th member continued.  
"量产机型均配备了 S2 引擎，对付东京-3 的那两台应该绰绰有余。" 第 05 号成员继续说道。

"There may be losses…" The 04th monolith said, letting the question hang in the air.  
"可能会有损失……" 第 04 号成员如石碑般静立，将这个问题悬于空中。

"Even if there are, more units are in production, there will be sufficient Evas for the ceremony, what matters is recovering Unit-01 before Ikari can use Adam and Lilith." The 07th member, now fully onboard with the scheme, replied.  
"即便有，更多的 EVA 正在生产中，仪式所需的 EVA 数量是足够的，关键在于在碇司令利用亚当和莉莉丝之前，夺回初号机。" 第七位成员现在完全支持这个计划，回应道。

"Once the Evas are dealt with the JSSDF should be able to move directly into the Geofront, bypassing the civilians." The 02nd member said with a scoff at the end at the pointlessness of worry about collateral damage given how all this was going to end.  
"一旦 EVA 被处理掉，日本自卫队应该能够直接进入地底都市，绕过平民。" 第二位成员带着对担心附带损害的无谓性的嘲讽说道，毕竟这一切都将如何结束。

"We may even be able to capture Unit-01 then and there." The 04th member posited optimistically.  
"我们甚至有可能当场捕获初号机。" 第四位成员乐观地提出。

"What of Unit-02?" The 03rd member asked.  
“二号机呢？”第三名成员问道。

"It's expendable." Lorenz Keel stated in a tone that brooked no room for compromise. He would not be stopped now, not when they were so close. He'd been alive for far longer than he had any right to, his body an amalgamation of experimental life-saving cybernetics and that flesh he couldn't replace and still be called human, all in order so that he might witness the day where SEELE's long machinations finally bore fruit.  
“它是可消耗的。”洛伦兹·基尔以一种不容妥协的语气说道。现在他们已经如此接近目标，他绝不会被阻止。他活得太久了，远超他应有的权利，他的身体是实验性救命的赛博格和那些无法替换仍被称为人类的血肉的混合体，这一切都是为了见证 SEELE 长久谋划最终结出果实的那一天。

So, he gave the word:  
于是，他下达了命令：

"The next dawn will be Mankind's last."  
「下一个黎明将是人类的末日。」

**Central Dogma: The Same Time  
中央教条区：同一时刻**

Misato crawled into the inner recesses of the physical body of the Magi. Past the endless scribbled notes and cables, she saw a once familiar face.  
美里爬进了 MAGI 的物理机体深处，穿过无数潦草的笔记和电缆，她看到了一张曾经熟悉的面孔。

"Ritsuko." Misato whispered to her at-some-point friend.  
"律子。" 美里低声对这位不知何时结识的朋友说道。

"It's you." The faux blonde looked up from the small screen illuminating her haggard appearance.  
"是你。" 这位假金发女郎从小小的屏幕上抬起头，屏幕的光映照出她憔悴的面容。

Though in truth Misato didn't look much better.  
虽然实际上美里看起来也没好到哪儿去。

When she'd heard that an A-801 had been issued by Tokyo-2, stripping NERV HQ of the diplomatic immunity and protections it enjoyed as a UN organization operating on Japanese soil Misato had feared the worse. Both her and the erstwhile spy were convinced that whatever the machinations in the background were their focal point was Tokyo-3, which given what she's seen made sense.  
当她得知东京-2 发布了一项 A-801 指令，剥夺了 NERV 总部作为联合国组织在日本境内享有的外交豁免权和保护时，美里最担心的事情发生了。她和那位前间谍都确信，无论幕后有什么阴谋，焦点都是东京-3，考虑到她所见的一切，这合乎情理。

She'd rushed to Central Dogma as fast as she could, only to hear upon her arrival, to her utter disbelief, that Ritsuko was in the guts of the Magi essentially performing a miracle to keep NERV HQ safe. The NERV Major seeing a golden opportunity had used her position as Operations Director as a cover, saying she needed to personally oversee in order to make tactical decisions. Though a nod to the bridge crew had told her fellow conspirators what was really happening.  
她尽可能快地冲向中央教条区，却在抵达时听到一个令她难以置信的消息：律子正在 MAGI 的核心部分，几乎是在创造奇迹以确保 NERV 总部的安全。这位 NERV 少校看到了一个黄金机会，利用她作为作战部主任的职位作为掩护，声称需要亲自监督以做出战术决策。尽管向桥员的一个点头已经告诉了她的同谋者真正发生的事情。

"You said you had to be outside that cell." Misato said, snapping back to reality by reminding her former college roommate of their last conversation, "Well I can't think of a better place to be!"  
“你说过你必须在那间牢房外。”美里说道，通过提醒她大学时的室友他们上次的对话来回到现实，“好吧，我想不出比这里更好的地方了！”

"It won't change anything, it's far too late." The scientist said as she leaned her tired head back against the metal of the tiny corridor they were in and removed her glasses to rub at her eyes.  
"这改变不了什么，已经太迟了。" 科学家说着，将她疲惫的头靠在狭窄走廊的金属壁上，摘下眼镜揉了揉眼睛。

"Don't give me that crap! There's hope as long as we're alive!" the purple-head angrily whispered, being careful to keep in mind how far her voice might carry out of the Magi's physical housing.  
"别跟我说这些废话！只要我们还活着，就有希望！" 紫发女子愤怒地低声说道，小心翼翼地考虑到她的声音可能会传到魔法师的物理空间之外。

"Fine…" The faux blonde acquiesced with a sigh after returning her glasses, quickly opening up a series of files before handing off the laptop  
"好吧……" 假金发女子叹了口气，重新戴上眼镜后，迅速打开一系列文件，然后将笔记本电脑递了过去。

"This…this!" Misato gasped in disbelief as she skimmed over the data on the screen, barely scratching the surface, yet it was still far worse than even her most pessimistic fears of what was truly going on behind the scenes.  
“这…这！” 美里难以置信地喘息着，她匆匆浏览屏幕上的数据，仅触及皮毛，却已远比她最悲观的猜测还要糟糕，幕后真相的阴霾远超她的想象。

"There exists a dark core in the minds of men from whence all despair arises. All Man's achievements and endeavors have been at their heart about filling that void." Ritsuko said melancholically, it did make sense from a purely logical point of view. The culmination of that longing for completeness by transforming humanity from loosely connected individuals to a gestalt.  
“人类心灵深处潜藏着黑暗的核心，所有绝望皆由此而生。人类的一切成就与努力，归根结底都是为了填补那个空洞。” 律子忧郁地说道，从纯粹的逻辑角度来看，这确实有其道理。这种对完整性的渴望，最终将人类从松散的个体转变为统一的整体。

"Crush everyone's minds together and fill the gaps, eh?! Who the hell made you Mankind's overseer?!" Misato hissed with venom lacing every word as she didn't recognize the woman in front of her, reflective glasses blocking any view of the windows of her soul.  
“把所有人的思想碾压在一起，填补空隙，是吗？！谁给了你成为人类监督者的权力？！” 美里咬牙切齿地低声怒斥，眼前的女人戴着反光眼镜，遮蔽了她的灵魂之窗，让她感到陌生。

"I didn't ask for your judgment! Have you considered how many poor wretches in this clusterfuck of a world would welcome this!?" Ritsuko answered indignantly thinking of her own reasons for agreeing to help Gendo other than being his lover.  
“我可没求你评判我！你有没有想过，这个乱七八糟的世界里，有多少可怜人会欢迎这种事！？” 律子愤愤不平地回答，想到自己除了作为他的情人之外，还有其他原因同意帮助源堂。

And the faux blonde had a point.  
而那个假金发女郎说得有道理。

The masses of starving and destitute, living short, cruel, and brutish lives, with no hope for a future. Those overwhelmed by loneliness and sadness, many of whom were addicts of one thing or another in order to find a way out of the prison their own minds had become. They _**would**_ probably see Instrumentality and what it offered as a viable alternative. But does that make it right?  
那些饥饿、贫困的群众，过着短暂、残酷、野蛮的生活，对未来毫无希望。那些被孤独和悲伤压垮的人，许多人沉迷于某种事物，试图找到逃离自己心灵牢笼的出口。他们可能会将人类补完计划及其提供的东西视为可行的选择。但这难道就对了吗？

"I want to live." Misato said quietly as she grabbed the cross around her neck from her father and thought of the man who reminded her so much of him, who despite everything made her feel safe and loved in this lonely world.  
"我想活下去。" 美里轻声说道，她抓住了父亲留给她的十字架，想起了那个与父亲如此相似的男人，尽管一切艰难，却让她在这个孤独的世界中感到安全和被爱。

Ritsuko sighed again at her former college roommate's answer as she took the computer back from the purple headed major and made a compressed copy of all SEELE's and NERV's secrets onto a small drive.  
听到大学室友的回答，律子再次叹了口气，从紫发的少校手中接过电脑，将 SEELE 和 NERV 的所有秘密压缩复制到一个微型驱动器上。

"There's no external datalinks of any kind remaining between us and the outside world, how do you intend to get it to him?" The former head of Project E said as she handed the drive to NERV's Operations Director.  
"我们与外界没有任何形式的外部数据链接，你打算怎么把它交给他？" 前 E 计划负责人说着，将驱动器递给了 NERV 的作战部长。

"You let me worry about that." Misato said with a grin as she sheltered it between her bust where she hoped it wouldn't be spotted.  
"你就不用操心这个了。" 美里笑着说，将它藏在自己的胸前，希望不会被人发现。

**The Scaffold Overlooking Unit-02: 18 Hours Later  
俯瞰二号机的脚手架：18 小时后**

"Has something happened?" Asuka asked as she approached together with Shinji both dressed in their plugsuits as Misato had asked, while their guardian let out an ironic chuckle as her mind flipped Asuka's question over in her mind.  
"发生了什么事吗？" 明日香问道，她和真嗣一起走近，两人都穿着插入栓服，这是美里要求的。他们的监护人发出一声讽刺的轻笑，心中反复琢磨着明日香的问题。

A clearly exhausted Major Katsuragi craned her head to look at her two wards, her tired limbs leaning against the bare metal.  
明显疲惫不堪的葛城美里少校转头看向她的两个监护对象，疲惫的四肢倚靠在裸露的金属上。

'I hope I'm doing the right thing Kaji.' Misato thought to herself as she answered: "After everything that has been asked of you both, I think you deserve to know the truth." And if all the headlights on the main highway she'd seen the previous night when she had gone to a spot, she'd pre-arranged with Kaji for dead drops were anything to go by then whatever was happening it was going to happen sooner rather than later.  
'我希望我做的是正确的，加持。' 美里心中暗想，然后回答道："经历了这么多你们被要求的事情，我认为你们有权知道真相。" 如果昨晚她去与加持事先约定好的地点进行秘密交接时，所见的主干道上所有的车灯都预示着什么的话，那么无论发生什么，都将是早于晚的。

"What's going on Misato?" Shinji asked, not knowing how deep the rabbit hole went for the answer to that question. Misato let out a sigh in response and then said the words:  
“发生了什么，美里？”真嗣问道，不知道这个问题的答案会牵扯多深。美里叹了口气，然后说出了那句话：

"The Human Instrumentality Project." The purple head said as turned her gaze back into Unit-02's four eyes rather than those of the pilots.  
"人类补完计划。" 紫色头发的女子说道，她将目光从驾驶员们身上转回到二号机的四只眼睛上。

From those four words she spun the tale of how the Council that oversaw NERV was really a secret cabal named SEELE bent on transforming humanity, a flawed colony organism, that they believed had hit an impasse, into a perfect single lifeform. How Second Impact was also their doing, as an attempt to minimize the damage by regressing the First Angel, Adam, to an embryonic state before the other Angels could awaken. And how now that the Angels were gone, they intended to trigger a Third Impact. But to implement that plan they needed an Eva and were coming to get it.  
从这四个字中，她编织了一个故事，讲述了监督 NERV 的委员会实际上是一个名为 SEELE 的秘密集团，他们意图将人类——一个有缺陷的群体生物——转变为一个完美的单一生命体，因为他们认为人类已经达到了一个瓶颈。她还讲述了第二次冲击也是他们的所作所为，试图通过将第一个使徒亚当退化到胚胎状态来减少损害，以防止其他使徒苏醒。而现在，既然使徒已经消失，他们打算引发第三次冲击。但要实施这个计划，他们需要一台 EVA，并且正在前来夺取。

"That's insane!" Asuka screamed, her ire bubbling over, "That's what me and mama have been fighting for!?" She let out another string of German curses as her hands and feet struck the metal rails with loud reverberating clangs.  
"这太疯狂了！" 明日香尖叫道，她的愤怒如沸水般翻腾，"这就是我和妈妈一直在对抗的吗！？" 她又用德语咒骂了一连串，手和脚猛击金属栏杆，发出响亮的回响声。

"Misato" Shinji began, keeping calmer than his better half, "Why is my father opposing SEELE?"  
"美里" 真嗣开始说道，保持了比另一半更冷静的态度，"为什么我父亲要反对 SEELE？"

"Yeah, aren't they all on the apocalypse team?!" Asuka asked with incredulity born more out of anger than logic as another fist crashed into bending metal.  
"对啊，他们不都是末日团队的人吗？！" 明日香带着更多的是愤怒而非逻辑的怀疑问道，同时又一拳砸向了弯曲的金属。

"No, he has his own vision for Instrumentality, a selfish one." Misato answered her tone downcast.  
"不，他对人类补完计划有自己的愿景，一个自私的愿景。" 美里回答道，语气低沉。

"Mother…" Shinji gave voice to the unasked question, as his teeth grit and hands clenched at his side as emotions swirled in the maelstrom of his soul until he felt a hand cover the shaking fist at his side.  
"母亲……" 真嗣吐露了未问出口的疑问，他的牙齿紧咬，双手紧握在身侧，情感在他的灵魂漩涡中翻涌，直到一只手覆盖在他颤抖的拳头旁。

He looked up at an Asuka that had calmed down, whose cerulean eyes were as fiery as her hair, as anger morphed into determination to stop the bastards' plans dead in their tracks. Shinji closed his own cobalt orbs and took a deep breath, drawing on the deep reservoir of will in his heart, before they opened again the cobalt of his irises laced with cold resolve. They nodded to each other and then looked back to Misato and gave her a synchronous nod.  
他抬头看向已经平静下来的明日香，她的碧眼如她的红发般炽热，愤怒转化为阻止那些混蛋计划的坚定决心。真嗣闭上自己的钴蓝色眼眸，深吸一口气，汲取内心深处的意志力，再次睁开眼时，他的虹膜中闪烁着冷酷的决意。他们互相点头，然后转向美里，同步地向她点头示意。

"Listen… there's one more thing…" Misato began: "Man comes from Lilith, a being similar to Adam, we are in essence the 18th Angel."  
"听着……还有一件事……" 美里开始说道："人类源自莉莉丝，一个与亚当相似的存在，我们本质上就是第 18 使徒。"

"Just like he said, Man and Angels can't share the same world." Shinji said as he closed his eyes and remembered what Nagisa had told the both of them in Terminal Dogma.  
“正如他所说，人类和天使无法共享同一个世界。” 真嗣闭上眼睛，回忆起在最终教条区渚告诉他们两人的话。

"And now that the Angels are gone." Asuka added letting the question hang for a moment before Misato answered it.  
“现在天使们已经消失了。” 明日香补充道，让这个问题悬而未决片刻，直到美里回答。

"Mankind turns on itself." Misato said in disgust at the whole situation they found themselves in now, her earlier tiredness replaced by rebuilt fortitude as she continued: "Listen, if we can hold out, we can buy enough time for Kaji to get the truth of-"  
“人类开始自相残杀。” 美里厌恶地谈及他们目前所处的整个局势，她早先的疲惫被重新建立的坚韧所取代，继续说道：“听着，如果我们能坚持住，我们就能为加持争取足够的时间去揭露真相——”

Major Katsuragi was cut off by the ringing of the terminal on the catwalk the three of them found themselves on. A cold shiver ran down the Operations Directors spine as she knew that that terminal should only be accessible from lieutenant Hyuga's station and that he would only call if…  
葛城美里少校被他们所在天桥上的终端铃声打断了。一阵寒意沿着作战部主任的脊背窜下，她知道那个终端本应只能从副官青叶的岗位访问，而他只有在……

"Katsuragi here." Misato began as she listened to her subordinates sit-rep before responding: "Then it's as we feared, you know what to do."  
“我是葛城。”美里开始说道，她听着下属的简报，然后回应：“那么正如我们所担心的，你知道该怎么做。”

Misato placed the receiver back into the console and looked at the two pilots dressed in their plugsuits.  
美里将听筒放回控制台，看向两位身着插入栓服的驾驶员。

"Take these." Major Katsuragi said as she reached into her red jacket and pulled out two small drives, throwing one to each of her wards.  
"拿着这些。" 葛城美里少校说着，伸手进她的红色夹克里，掏出两个小驱动器，分别扔给了她的两个守护者。

"What are they?" Asuka asked as she looked down at the unassuming piece of technology.  
"这是什么？" 明日香问道，低头看着这个不起眼的小科技产品。

"They're something Maya managed to cook up with Ritsuko's data. They'll override any external commands from Central Dogma, or anywhere else for that matter, to your Evas." The purple headed major explained.  
"这是玛雅利用律子博士的数据搞出来的东西。它们能覆盖来自中央教条区或其他任何地方对你们 EVA 的外部指令。" 紫发的少校解释道。

"Why would we need these?" Shinji asked as he turned the electronic device over in his hand  
"我们为什么要这些？" 真嗣问道，手中翻转着那个电子设备

"Nine heavy air carriers just passed over the Gotemba Defense Line. They're probably carrying the Eva Series, and likely intend to capture one of your Evas." Misato now definitely in her commander persona briefed her pilots.  
"九艘重型航空母舰刚刚通过了御殿场防线。它们很可能载有 Eva 系列机体，并有意捕获你们其中一台 Eva。" 美里此刻完全进入了指挥官的角色，向她的驾驶员们简报。

"They finished them?" Asuka exclaimed in disbelief.  
"他们完成了？" 明日香难以置信地惊呼。

"Eva Series?" Shinji asked definitely puzzled.  
"Eva 系列？" 真嗣确实感到困惑。

"Mass Produced Evangelions, likely all fitted with dummy plugs and artificial S2 drives." Misato clarified before adding: "Commander Ikari ordered that only Unit-02 sortie to meet them, but I'm sending both of you out there." Her eyes turned to look at Shinji as her chin motioned toward the drive she'd given him: "He clearly doesn't want you going out. So, he might try something, like increasing the pressure of the LCL in your entry plug, rendering you unconscious, to keep Unit-01 safe."  
"量产型 Eva，很可能都配备了傀儡系统和人造 S2 机关。" 美里解释道，随后补充说："碇司令命令只有二号机出击迎战，但我打算派你们两个都去。" 她的目光转向真嗣，下巴示意他手中的驱动器："他显然不想让你出击。所以，他可能会采取一些措施，比如增加插入栓内 LCL 的压力，让你失去意识，以确保零号机的安全。"

Shinji nodded as he understood and wrapped his hands tight around the drive.  
真嗣点头表示理解，紧紧握住了手中的驱动器。

"Understood." Both pilots said synchronously and began to run towards their Evas before their guardian's voice stopped them:  
"明白了。" 两位驾驶员异口同声地说道，随即开始向他们的 Eva 跑去，却被他们守护者的声音叫住：

"Listen, be careful out there."  
"听着，在外面要小心。"

"What will you do Misato?" Shinji asked as they both turned to look at the closest thing to a mother either had left.  
"美里小姐，你打算怎么办？" 真嗣问道，两人同时转向了他们各自所剩无几的亲人般的存在。

Misato took out her sidearm, ejecting the magazine to verify it had live rounds before loading it back in and racking the slide.  
美里拔出她的配枪，退出弹匣检查里面是否有实弹，然后重新装入并拉动了滑套。

"Something I should have done a long time ago."  
“早该这么做了。”

**Central Dogma: Some Minutes Later  
中央教条区：几分钟后**

"Unit-01 is launching as well, I can't override it!" Lieutenant Ibuki yelled out from her console.  
“初号机也在启动，我无法阻止它！”伊吹摩耶少尉从她的控制台前喊道。

But Gendo Ikari, Supreme Commander of NERV, wasn't convinced, he had only gotten this far because he knew when he was being deceived. Her tone did not have the same timber, that trace of terror, as other instances of genuine surprise he had heard throughout the Angel War. Which led to only one conclusion.  
但 NERV 最高指挥官碇源堂并不相信，他之所以能走到今天，正是因为他知道何时被人欺骗。她的语气并没有同样的音色，那种与其他真正惊讶时刻所听到的恐惧痕迹。这只能得出一个结论。

"Would you look after things Sensei?" Gendo said softly to the closest thing he had to a friend as his steepled hands unfurled for the last time.  
“你能照看一切吗，老师？”碇源堂轻声对这位他最亲近的朋友说道，他的双手最后一次从交叠中展开。

"I understand, give my best to Yui." Vice-Commander Kozo Fuyutsuki said as he watched Rokobungi disappear as his personal lift took him to Terminal Dogma. He was too close to stop now.  
"我明白了，代我向 Yui 问好。" 副司令 Kozo Fuyutsuki 说道，他看着 Rokobungi 随着他的私人电梯消失在终端教条区。他已经走得太远，无法回头了。

The Vice-Commander let out a sigh as the hatch sealed, though not even a minute passed before NERV's outspoken Operations Director followed by a contingent of NERV security burst into Central Dogma and bloodlessly took over. As the troops restrained everyone whose loyalty wasn't a hundred percent guaranteed Misato rushed up to where Gendo had his throne.  
副司令叹了口气，舱门刚关闭不到一分钟，NERV 直言不讳的操作主任便带着一队 NERV 安全人员冲进了中央教条区，不流血地接管了这里。当士兵们制服那些忠诚度未达百分百的人时，Misato 冲向了 Gendo 的王座所在之处。

"You're too late." Fuyutsuki said to the Major, a hint of regret seeping into his voice as his old bones collapsed into a nearby chair.  
"你来晚了。" Fuyutsuki 对少校说道，声音中透出一丝悔意，他的老骨头瘫坐在附近的椅子上。

"God damn it!" Misato screamed as she kicked Gendo's vacated throne before furiously ordering the accompanying security personal to head to Terminal Dogma and try and cut off Ikari before he could enact his plan.  
“该死！”美里尖叫着一脚踢向碇源堂空荡荡的宝座，随后愤怒地下令随行的安保人员前往中央教条区，试图在碇源堂实施他的计划之前截住他。

"Units-01 and 02 have reached the surface!" Aoba broke the definitely now ex-Operations Director out of her fury and back into her element.  
“初号机和零号机已到达地面！”青叶的话让前作战部长从愤怒中回过神来，重新投入到她的职责中。

In their hastily made deployment plan, they had considered the rural area around Lake Ashi or somewhere else in the hills away from the city, but ultimately decided they needed the cover urban terrain offered in addition to the more plentiful armory buildings in the fortress city.  
在他们仓促制定的部署计划中，原本考虑过芦之湖周边的乡村地区或其他远离城市的山区，但最终决定他们需要城市地形提供的掩护，以及堡垒城市中更为丰富的军械库建筑。

"Have our AA batteries remain on standby, they might not even scratch the paint but maybe we can distract their targeting systems with our attacks." Misato said as she turned around and slammed both her hands on the table where Gendo's elbows had so often been.  
"让我们的 AA 电池保持待命状态，它们可能连漆都刮不掉，但也许我们的攻击能分散他们的瞄准系统。" 美里说着转过身，双手重重地拍在桌子上，那里曾是碇司令手肘常放的地方。

"What about the JSSDF Perimeter?" A clearly hesitant Maya asked.  
"那日本自卫队周边区域呢？" 显然有些犹豫的摩耶问道。

"As long as they're just content with observing, ignore them." Misato ordered from Gendo's abdicated throne.  
"只要他们满足于观察，就别理他们。" 美里从碇司令退位的宝座上发号施令。

"Heavy air carriers are deploying their Evas!" Hyuga yelled as Central Dogma's monitor switched to a maximum magnification, yet still grainy feed of the nine flying wings disgorging those white behemoths and slipping away.  
“重型航空母舰正在部署他们的 Eva！”日向大声喊道，中央教条区的监视器切换到了最大倍率，但画面依然模糊，显示着那九架飞行翼释放出那些白色巨兽，随即悄然离去。

"Shinji! Asuka!" Misato called out as she grabbed a proffered headset from a red-bereted security troop armed with a MPi-69.  
“真嗣！明日香！”美里呼喊着，从一名戴着红色贝雷帽、手持 MPi-69 冲锋枪的安保人员那里接过递来的耳机。

"We see them." The pilots answered as one as they got their first good look at their final enemy.  
“我们看到了。”两位驾驶员异口同声地回答，他们首次清晰地看到了最终的敌人。

Gliding on gull wings that made them appear more angelic than human construct they circled above Tokyo-3 maintaining a constant distance from each other in their formation.  
借助海鸥翅膀般的滑翔，它们显得比人类造物更为天使化，在东京-3 上空盘旋，保持着彼此间的恒定距离，形成队形。

Though after a tense minute had passed the MP Evas abruptly stopped as one and somehow floating without flapping their wings raised the oversized bladed spears they carried in their right hand and as one launched the nine projectiles directly at Asuka's precious Unit-02.  
尽管在一分钟的紧张对峙后，这些 MP 使徒突然齐齐停下，仿佛悬浮般未扇动翅膀，它们举起右手所持的巨大刀刃长矛，同时向明日香珍爱的二号机发射了九枚投射物。

"Crap!" Shinji cursed as he realized with barely a spare moment the MP Evas' target and extended his AT Field to reinforce Asuka's while he pushed Unit-01 into a sprint faster than even his dash to catch Sahaquiel.  
“该死！”真嗣咒骂道，他在最后一刻意识到 MP 使徒的目标，并迅速扩展 AT 力场加强明日香的防御，同时一号机以超越追逐萨哈魁尔时的速度疾驰而去。

The nine blades impacted the combined and reinforced AT Fields and for a brief moment stopped as Asuka stood her ground.  
九把刀刃撞击在联合并强化的 AT 力场上，短暂地停滞了片刻，而明日香坚定地站在原地。

Her determination turned to horror however as they morphed into copies of the weapon she had sent into Lunar orbit when she defeated Arael.  
然而，她的决心转瞬间化为恐惧，因为这些刀刃变形为她在击败亚拉尔时发射到月球轨道的武器的复制品。

"The Lance of Longinus!" Asuka gasped in shock as the false lances tore through the AT Field around her and screamed toward her.  
“朗基努斯之枪！”明日香惊呼出声，假枪撕裂了她周围的 AT 力场，尖啸着向她袭来。

But not a single one impacted the red form of Unit-02. Shinji in his purple biomechanical android had managed to tackle her out of the way of danger, though one of the lances had clipped the side of his Eva.  
但没有一支能击中红色的二号机。身着紫色生物机械机甲的碇真嗣成功将她从危险中撞开，尽管其中一支长矛擦伤了他的 Eva。

"Shinji!" Asuka screamed to her lover in video comms within their entry plugs, her heart weighed down as she saw the painful grimace on Shinji's face as he pulled a bloodied hand up from the part of his body that was the same as where Unit-01 was hit.  
“真嗣！”在插入栓内的视频通讯中，明日香对着她的爱人尖叫，看到真嗣因痛苦而扭曲的脸庞，她心如铅重，因为他正从与初号机受击相同部位的血迹中抬起手来。

"Be careful, those don't just damage the Eva." Shinji said as he gritted his teeth and adrenaline pumped through his body, numbing the pain and letting him focus.  
“小心，这些攻击不仅会损伤 Eva。”真嗣咬紧牙关说道，肾上腺素在他体内奔涌，麻木了疼痛，让他得以集中精神。

"How is that possible!?" Asuka asked the bridge crew in Central dogma as an armory building next to them opened.  
"这怎么可能！？" 明日香在中央教条区的舰桥上向船员们问道，旁边的一个军械库建筑突然打开。

"It must be due to how the AT piercing projectiles interact with the neural feedback system!" Maya Ibuki hypothesized in a frantic tone as she sought any possible counter.  
"这一定是由于 AT 穿刺弹与神经反馈系统的相互作用！" 伊吹玛雅急切地推测着，试图寻找任何可能的反制措施。

"_**Verdammt!**_" Asuka cursed in her native tongue as she looked at the macabre looking forest of lances that punctured the area she'd been standing in. 'If he hadn't…' the thought raced through Asuka's mind before Shinji interrupted her brooding:  
"该死！" 明日香用她的母语咒骂着，看着那片刺穿她原本站立区域的恐怖长矛森林。'如果不是他……' 这个念头在明日香脑海中疾驰而过，但被真嗣打断了她的沉思：

"Go north I'll cover this angle." Shinji said as he dropped to one knee and aimed down the sights of his pallet rifle at the MP Evas, still circling above, albeit with a much more agitated formation.  
“向北走，我来掩护这个角度。”真嗣说着单膝跪地，通过支架步枪的瞄准镜对准了仍在上方盘旋的 MP 使徒，尽管它们的队形变得更加躁动不安。

"Right." Asuka said as she ran down the street, glancing at the displayed map of Tokyo-3's urban layout.  
“好。”明日香应道，沿着街道奔跑，不时瞥一眼显示的第三新东京市城市布局图。

Eventually one of the MP Eva, perhaps as a sacrificial lamb was sent down to retrieve a false lance once both Evas had melted from their line of sight into the dense concrete jungle.  
最终，其中一架 MP 使徒或许作为牺牲品被派遣下来，试图在两架使徒从视线中消失于密集的混凝土丛林后，取回那支假的长矛。

As it descended both Shinji and Asuka got a good look at the monstrosities they were facing. Their wings weren't the only deviation from the humanoid form they had made, their heads in place of analogues for eyes or noses or any other human facial features had instead a vast toothed maw that only added to their animalistic demeanor.  
当它降落时，真嗣和明日香得以仔细观察他们所面对的怪物。它们的翅膀并非唯一偏离人形的特征，取而代之的是，它们的头部没有类似眼睛、鼻子或其他人类面部特征，而是长着一张巨大的、布满利齿的嘴，这更增添了它们的兽性。

The chosen alabaster unit grabbed hold of its designated facsimile only to be caught in the pilots' ambush. A crossfire of two pallet rifles tore into the white armor and flesh beneath as the MP Eva sought to pull the stuck lance out of the asphalt and armor layer beneath.  
被选中的白色机体抓住了它的指定仿制品，却陷入了驾驶员的伏击。两支步枪的交叉火力撕裂了白色装甲及其下的血肉，而 MP Eva 则试图从沥青和装甲层下拔出卡住的矛。

"Their only advantage is their numbers and those fancy spears." Asuka said confidently as the bullet ridden form of the MP Eva collapsed onto the street and she turned her head to look over to where Shinji's Unit-01 was two blocks away.  
“它们唯一的优势就是数量和那些花哨的长矛。”明日香自信地说道，子弹横飞的 MP Eva 倒在了街道上，她转头望向两街区外真嗣的 01 号机所在之处。

"Asuka that Eva is reactivating!" Misato warned over their comms.  
"明日香，那台 EVA 正在重新启动！" 美里通过通讯警告道。

"Wha-!" A surprised Asuka gasped as the blood-stained MP Eva began moving again grasping its lance as those feathered wings unfurled and it retreated up into the sky with a snarl, the last few rounds in Asuka and Shinji's pallet rifles missing their mark as they tried to track their escaping target and the German redhead realized their foe had three advantages.  
"什——！" 明日香惊呼一声，只见那台血迹斑斑的量产型 EVA 再次动了起来，紧握长矛，羽翼展开，咆哮着升空逃遁，而她和真嗣的弹匣步枪最后几发子弹未能命中目标。这位德国红发少女意识到，他们的敌人拥有三大优势。

The revived MP Eva rejoined its brethren, its prize clasped in its hand as the nine white monsters appeared to levitate in midair, their jaws seeming to leer in grotesque delight for a moment before they all dived towards Mankind's last champions.  
复活的量产型 EVA 与同伴汇合，手中紧握着战利品，九只白色怪物仿佛悬浮在半空中，它们的嘴角似乎露出了一瞬间的狰狞喜悦，随后齐齐俯冲向人类最后的勇士们。

"Fire now!" Misato screamed as her white knuckles shook as they gripped the table in front of her as Tokyo-3's readied defenses sent up a screen of fire between the battling groups of Evas.  
“现在开火！”美里尖叫着，她紧握桌面的手指因用力而泛白，东京-3 的防御系统随即启动，在激战中的 EVA 群之间升起一道火墙。

The flak and missiles, just as Misato had predicted, were completely impotent against the MP Evas, but the clouds of smoke they left combined with the heat of the explosions, was able to momentarily discombobulate their onboard tracking. Giving Units-01 and 02 an added layer of cover.  
正如美里所预料，高射炮和导弹对 MP EVA 完全无效，但它们留下的烟雾与爆炸产生的热量，却能暂时扰乱其机载追踪系统，为初号机和二号机增添了一层掩护。

The individual MP Evas having lost their designated targets landed in a dispersed manner among the buildings swiftly using their immense size and strength to destroy the few remaining anti-air weapons that hadn't been lost in either Zeruel's attack or mothballed due to budget cuts SEELE had likely contrived for such a contingency.  
失去目标的 MP EVA 们分散降落在建筑群中，迅速利用其庞大的体型和力量，摧毁了那些未在 Zeruel 攻击中损毁或因 SEELE 可能策划的预算削减而封存的剩余防空武器。

But that afforded the pilots precious seconds.  
但这为驾驶员们赢得了宝贵的几秒钟。

The Second Child made her move first.  
第二适格者率先行动。

Leaping out from an alcove between buildings as one of the white leviathans crushed an automated 25-millimeter AA gun. The MP Eva turned around just in time to have its monstrous maw grabbed by Unit-02's hands. Asuka letting out a battle cry as her Eva's hands crushed her opponent's head, the toothed lower jaw hanging limply as the trauma forced deactivation.  
从两栋建筑间的壁龛中一跃而出，就在其中一头白色巨兽碾碎了一台自动 25 毫米高射炮的瞬间。MP 使徒及时转身，却被二号机双手紧紧抓住了那张狰狞的大口。明日香操控着她的 Eva，双手猛力挤压对手的头颅，发出战斗的怒吼，对方那布满利齿的下颚因遭受重创而无力垂下，被迫停机。

To Asuka's right the armory building opened and from it she grabbed an Eva-sized axe and holding it one handed hacked into the carapace of the white unit her other limbs were pinning to the street as whoever was operating it desperately tried manual reactivation. In under twenty seconds the white beast's twelve-thousand layers of advanced armor lay hewed and chopped about along with hunks of bleeding flesh as Asuka found her prize and with one last swing buried the axe head up to the shaft into the exposed red orb that was the monster's core. Silencing a beast that had taken half a continent's resources to construct.  
在明日香的右侧，军械库的大门敞开，她从中抓起一把 EVA 尺寸的巨斧，单手握持，猛烈劈砍向白色机体的甲壳，其四肢正将其牢牢钉在街道上，而操作它的某人正拼命尝试手动重启。不到二十秒，这头白色巨兽的十二层先进装甲便被砍得支离破碎，血肉横飞，明日香找到了她的目标，最后一击将斧头深深埋入那暴露在外的红色球体——怪物的核心之中。终结了一头耗费半个大陆资源建造的巨兽。

"The core's in the chest just like on other Evas!" Asuka told Shinji over the din of battle as she jumped away from the area just as the now quieted MP Eva's brethren arrived in attempt to lend assistance: "That'll put them down for good!" She finished as her red behemoth landed on top of a building and dropped down into the concrete maze.  
“核心就在胸口，和其他 EVA 一样！”明日香在战斗的喧嚣中向真嗣喊道，她跳离该区域，就在此时，那已沉寂的 MP Eva 的同伴们赶到，试图提供援助：“这样就能彻底解决它们了！”她结束道，她的红色巨兽落在一座建筑顶上，随即跃入混凝土迷宫之中。

'Roger!" Shinji said from his position as he threw down the third empty pallet rifle in a minute as he'd been trying to suppress and drive off the MP Evas while Asuka figured out how to kill them.  
“收到！”真嗣从他的位置回应道，他扔下了第三支空弹匣的步枪，一分钟内已是如此，他一直在试图压制并驱散 MP EVA，同时明日香在寻找如何击杀它们的方法。

The remaining eight harbingers of SEELE's scenario weaved through Tokyo-3, showing less regard for collateral damage than the Angels ever did, in pursuit of the red unit that had felled their comrade. Sometimes extending their wings to get extra lift and speed in the chase.  
SEELE 剧本中剩余的八位使徒穿梭于东京-3，对附带损害的漠视程度甚至超过了使徒，只为追捕那台击倒他们同伴的红色机体。有时他们会展开翅膀，以获得额外的升力和速度。

Asuka led them south towards the outskirts around Lake Ashi. The MP Eva's seemingly howling in excitement as they believed they'd driven their quarry into the open, only to realize too late it had been a trap.  
明日香引领他们向南，前往芦之湖周边的郊区。那些 MP Eva 似乎在兴奋地咆哮，以为将猎物逼入了绝境，却直到最后才意识到那是个陷阱。

With a smug grin on her face, Asuka abruptly turned around about three blocks from the waterfront and an armored barrier, reminiscent of what had saved Shinji in his first skirmish with Ramiel, rose up out of the street just in time to stop the single lance that the flock of MP Evas had deigned to retrieve. While the false Lance of Longinus may have been able to penetrate any AT Field, 20 meters of reinforced Titanium composite was another matter. They soon discovered though that this was not the end of their troubles as Asuka retrieved from another armory building two massive rocket launchers and jumped up onto the armored battlement. Laying down a torrent of rockets, each big enough to sink an aircraft carrier, into the bunched-up group of Eva's that had been chasing her.  
带着得意的笑容，明日香在距离海滨大约三个街区的地方突然转身，一道装甲屏障从街道中升起，让人想起曾救过真嗣在与雷米尔初次交锋时的情景。这道屏障及时挡住了量产型 EVA 群决定取回的单支长枪。虽然那伪造的朗基努斯之枪或许能穿透任何 AT 力场，但 20 米厚的强化钛合金复合材料则是另一回事。然而，他们很快发现这并非麻烦的终结，因为明日香从另一座军械库中取出了两把巨大的火箭发射器，并跳上了装甲壁垒。她向那群紧追不舍的 EVA 发射了一连串火箭弹，每一枚都足以击沉一艘航空母舰。

The impacts left multiple bloody gashes in the Mass Production models and they extended their wings in an attempt to fly away and regroup.  
这些冲击在量产型 EVA 身上留下了多处血淋淋的伤口，它们展开翅膀试图飞离并重新集结。

One though, was too slow.  
但有一台，动作太慢了。

The purple form of Unit-01 crashed into it from behind and tackled the white unit into the waters of Lake Ashi. Shinji lacked a weapon even though Misato seemed determined to deplete every bit of fortress engineering and Eva-sized weapons in Tokyo-3 if that's what it took to win. But that didn't matter as a primal, animalistic, part within him almost relished using his hands for the kill.  
零一号机紫色的身影从后方猛撞过去，将白色机体扑入芦之湖中。尽管美里似乎决心不惜一切代价，动用东京-3 所有堡垒工程和 EVA 级武器来赢得胜利，但真嗣手中却连一件武器都没有。但这并不重要，因为他内心深处那原始、兽性的部分几乎享受着用双手终结对手的过程。

The Third Child howled in a rage as his Eva's hands ripped into the mewling monsters spine, reinforced tendons and fibrous muscle ripping and tearing until finally the flight unit was wrenched from its back, landing in the middle of the lake with a plop as Shinji cast it away to free up his fingers to dig through the now exposed flesh for the core. His fingers finding it in moments before those bulging muscles of Unit-01 crushed it and now two of SEELE's champions lay broken, never to rise again.  
第三适格者怒吼着，他的 EVA 双手撕裂了那呻吟怪物的脊椎，强化肌腱和纤维肌肉撕扯断裂，最终飞行单元被生生扯下，扑通一声落在湖中央，真嗣将其甩开以便腾出手指，探入此刻暴露的肉体寻找核心。他的手指很快找到了目标，随后零一号机那鼓胀的肌肉将其碾碎，如今 SEELE 的两名战士已支离破碎，再也无法起身。

However, in this time the other seven MP Evas had regrouped and now redirected their attention to the apparently exposed Unit-01, its hands dripping with the lifeblood of Unit-08 as it stood knee deep in rapidly darkening water.  
然而此时，其余七台量产机已经重新集结，并将注意力转向显然暴露无遗的零一号机，它的双手滴着零八号机的生命之血，站在逐渐变暗的湖水中，水深及膝。

This had been Katsuragi's plan however, as a tungsten-titanium glaive pierced one of the white units. It's path true, just as Asuka had calculated, as she launched the Eva-sized weapon like a javelin and had skewered the core along with the onboard dummy plug in a single strike.  
这正是葛城所策划的，一柄钨钛合金的长柄战斧贯穿了其中一台白色机体。正如明日香所计算的那样，她将这把与 EVA 尺寸相仿的武器如同标枪般投掷出去，一击便贯穿了核心及机载模拟插头。

"It's like you said Misato, they're moving like a flock of birds." Shinji said as he used the distraction to dash back into the urban cover of Tokyo-3.  
“就像美里你说的，它们像一群鸟一样移动。”真嗣说着，趁乱迅速撤回东京-3 的城市掩体中。

"We just need to keep picking them off one by one," Asuka said as she unloaded another pallet rifle into the remaining Evas to give Shinji more cover, "And we've got this."  
“我们只需逐个击破，”明日香一边用弹匣步枪向剩余的 EVA 射击，为真嗣提供更多掩护，一边说道，“这样就能搞定。”

"Don't lose focus yet." Misato warned as her eyes bounced between the unfolding battle and the remaining assets she had to use. She'd been luckier than she could have imagined in using Units-01 and 02 to draw the group of MP Evas in circles to give their partner a chance to pick off a straggler. But only a fool would think an enemy wouldn't adapt when faced with defeat: "They'll probably switch tactics soon. Move to the rendezvous and link up!"  
"别现在就分心。" 美里警告道，她的目光在展开的战斗和她剩余可用的资源之间来回跳跃。她比想象中更幸运，利用初号机和零号机将那群量产型 EVA 引得团团转，为他们的伙伴提供了逐个击破的机会。但只有傻瓜才会认为敌人在面临失败时不会调整战术："他们可能很快就会改变策略。前往汇合点，集结！"

"Roger!" Both acknowledged and melted back into the concrete jungle as the MP Evas licked their wounds, literally for a few of the more damaged ones.  
"收到！" 两人应声后便融入了混凝土丛林，而量产型 EVA 则在舔舐伤口，对于那些受损较重的来说，这几乎是字面意义上的。

With their numerical advantage reduced from 4.5 to 1 down to a mere 3 to 1 the winged monsters needed to regain the initiative as it was now very clear to the old men that one of the Mass Produced Evangelions was nowhere near a match for Unit-01 or 02 in single combat.  
随着数量优势从 4.5 比 1 降至仅 3 比 1，这些带翼的怪物需要重新夺回主动权，因为现在老练的指挥官们非常清楚，一架量产型 EVA 在单打独斗中远不是初号机或零号机的对手。

So, as one mass, they dived towards the eight false lances that were still impaled in Tokyo-3's roadway.  
于是，他们如同一股洪流，齐齐冲向插在东京-3 道路上的那八根假长枪。

Five of the white units retrieved a lance, while one, whether due to greed, a flawed command, or the inherent unpredictability of using Evangelions tried to dislodge a second lance as well.  
五台白色机体各自拔起一根长枪，而其中一台，或许是出于贪婪，或是指令失误，亦或是使用 EVA 本身的不确定性，试图同时拔起第二根长枪。

This proved to be a blunder, as this delayed the MP Eva for several critical seconds. Time enough for Unit-01 to crash through the building behind the white monster and barrel its stunned body through two more buildings while Asuka and the last half dozen of NERV's anti-air weapons unloaded a hail of fire on the other five to keep them off of Shinji.  
这无疑是个错误，因为它为此延误了数秒关键时间。足够让零号机从白色怪物身后的建筑中破墙而出，将其撞得晕头转向并穿透另外两座建筑，与此同时，明日香和 NERV 剩余的半打防空武器对准其他五台白色机体倾泻火力，以确保它们无法接近真嗣。

The third building's concrete and metal held strong rather than crumbling so Shinji instead moved Unit-01's grip from its shoulders to its left arm and head and began smashing the white beast's maw into the building repeatedly. Teeth breaking and tongue bleeding as the MP Eva wailed in pain.  
第三座建筑的混凝土与金属结构坚固异常，未见崩塌，于是真嗣将初号机的抓握从其肩部移至左臂与头部，开始反复将这白色巨兽的口部猛击向建筑物。牙齿断裂，舌头出血，MP 使徒痛苦哀嚎。

After the fourth such impact an armory building opened up next to Shinji and thrusting the wounded head into the building once more to keep it in place, he grabbed the oversized revolver left-handed and thrust it under the armpit of the squirming Eva. His finger depressing three times as he angled it towards where he knew the core would be. Those three battleship-caliber bullets tore through the armor plate and muscle bundles so that Shinji could just glimpse the tell-tale red orb.  
在第四次撞击后，一旁的军械库建筑敞开，真嗣将受伤的头部再次推入建筑内固定，他左手抓起那把超大号左轮手枪，将其塞入挣扎中的使徒腋下。他调整角度，指向他知道的核心位置，三次扣动扳机。这三发战舰级口径的子弹撕裂了装甲板与肌肉束，让真嗣得以瞥见那标志性的红色球体。

Pressing the barrel square against the core he pressed the firing stud in the entry plug until the revolver clicked empty and the tattered body of the white goliath slinked down the ruined façade.  
他将枪管正对核心，在插入栓内持续按压击发按钮，直到左轮手枪弹尽，那残破的白色巨人躯体缓缓滑下毁坏的立面。

"Five left." Shinji called out as Asuka's Unit-02 showed up next to him, dropping what had to be the tenth pallet rifle she'd emptied today as both she and Shinji had been laying down constant suppressing fire on the other MP Evas while they each engaged in one-on-one combats.  
“还剩五个。” 真嗣喊道，明日香的 02 号机出现在他旁边，丢下今天她已经打空的第十个弹药箱，她和真嗣一直在对其他 MP Evas 进行持续的压制射击，同时各自进行一对一的战斗。

"Tokyo-3's defensive batteries have been exhausted!" Misato informed them over the comms as the last of the guns lay silent for lack of shells.  
“东京-3 的防御炮台已经耗尽弹药！” 美里通过通讯告诉他们，随着最后一门炮因弹药不足而沉寂。

"And there don't seem to be a lot of armory buildings left either." Shinji said gravely as his eyes scanned the map in his entry plug of the remaining points overlaying the urban scheme.  
“而且看起来也没有多少军火库建筑剩下了。” 真嗣严肃地说，他的眼睛在插入栓的地图上扫描着城市布局上剩余的点位。

"Let's give these a whirl then!" Asuka excitedly suggested as she picked up one of the lances Shinji's latest opponent had died trying to get.  
“那我们试试这些吧！”明日香兴奋地提议道，她拿起了一支长矛，这是真嗣最近对手在试图夺取时丧命的那一支。

In Unit-01 and 02's hands they reverted to their standard double-bladed form, rather than a duplicate of the Lance of Longinus, but they were still deadly sharp with a crushing weight behind them.  
在零号机和二号机的手中，它们恢复了标准的双刃形态，而非朗基努斯之枪的复制品，但它们依然锋利无比，重量惊人。

The five remaining MP Evas growled in frustration, reflecting their masters' fury that the plans they had laid for decades and sacrificed so much to achieve were turning to ashes in their mouth because of the stubborn intransigence of those whose role they had neglected.  
剩下的五台 MP 使徒发出愤怒的咆哮，反映了它们主人的愤怒，他们为了实现数十年的计划，牺牲了那么多，却因为那些被忽视的角色所表现出的顽固不妥协，而使得一切化为泡影。

But those snarling monsters would not go quietly into that good night. Three of them threw their false lances at the lovers. One went wide and miss both of the massive forms outright, but the other two were aimed squarely at Asuka again.  
但那些咆哮的怪物不愿就此安静地消逝。其中三只将它们的假长矛投向了这对恋人。一支偏离了目标，完全错过了那两个庞大的身影，但另外两支却直指明日香。

But this time she was ready. Her AT Field again reinforced by Shinji gave her the split second she needed to spin her borrowed blade and knock both of the duplicates off course, careening into nearby buildings once they had broken the bolstered orange octagons that surrounded her.  
但这次她已做好准备。借助真嗣强化的 AT 力场，她获得了关键的片刻，旋转借来的刀刃，将两支复制品偏离轨道，它们在击破围绕她的强化橙色八边形屏障后，撞入了附近的建筑。

The other two white beasts had rushed towards the purple form of Unit-01 but once it became clear that their comrades' attack had failed to incapacitate Unit-02 they tried to retreat rather than take an even fight.  
另外两头白色巨兽冲向了紫色机体的零一，但当它们意识到同伴的攻击未能使零二失去战斗力时，它们选择了撤退而非硬碰硬。

One managed to fly away but Unit-01's grasp found the ankle of the second one and Shinji used all the strength his arm possessed to slam the MP Eva into the ground. Cracked concrete and asphalt radiating out from the impact.  
其中一只设法飞走了，但初号机的手抓住了第二只的脚踝，真嗣用尽手臂的所有力量将 MP 使徒猛地摔向地面。碎裂的混凝土和柏油从撞击点向外辐射。

The white unit managed to recover quickly though and using the lift offered by its wings pushed its body back up and brought its blade up sparking as it clashed with Unit-01's own blade as Shinji hastily blocked the enemy's desperate attack.  
白色机体虽然迅速恢复了平衡，利用翅膀提供的升力重新挺起身，将刀刃高高举起，与初号机的刀刃擦出火花，真嗣匆忙挡下了敌人绝望的攻击。

But this desperation seemed to blind it to the fact it was now outnumbered as Asuka's captured blade caught the white monstrosity in its left leg and everything below the knee tumbled away from its owner. The wounded and isolated MP Eva again tried to fly away but Unit-01 came from behind and sliced off the right wing, sending its now unbalanced body plummeting back to earth.  
但这种绝望似乎让它忽略了现在自己处于劣势的事实，明日香捕获的刀刃击中了白色怪物的左腿，膝盖以下的部分与主体分离。受伤且孤立的 MP 使徒再次试图飞离，但初号机从后方袭来，切断了它的右翼，使其失去平衡的身体再次坠向地面。

With a purple boot holding down the screaming, almost pleading, neck and a red one pinning its only remaining whole leg, two spears plunged down into the mass-produced torso and the writhing machine ceased its wailing.  
一只紫色战靴压在嘶喊着、几乎是在恳求的脖颈上，红色战靴则钉住其唯一完好的腿，两支长矛猛地刺入批量生产的躯体，那扭动的机器终于停止了哀嚎。

Shinji and Asuka panted inside their entry plugs as they both turned to face the final four MP Evas SEELE had.  
真嗣和明日香在插入栓内喘息着，两人同时转向面对 SEELE 所剩的最后四台量产型 EVA。

The white monsters roared in anger and rage reflective of their masters' fading dream of Instrumentality. Knowing that the time for caution had passed they let out one more howl then, as one force, rushed headlong at their purple and red enemies.  
那些白色怪物愤怒咆哮，其怒火映射出它们主人渐逝的统一化梦想。意识到谨慎已无必要，它们再次齐声长啸，如同一股力量，径直冲向紫色与红色的敌人。

Shinji and Asuka both letting out a battle cry from their lips ran forwards to meet them in the clash that would decide if Mankind would see the next sunrise.  
真嗣和明日香同时发出战斗的呐喊，向前冲去，这场冲突将决定人类是否能看到下一个日出。

**Terminal Dogma: Die Zeit zu wählen  
终端教条：选择之时**

"Rei...You're here, after all. The promised time has come. Let's go." The soft voice behind her called her name as she stared at the dilapidated walls of the place where she was born. She turned to face him before giving a small nod and following Gendo Ikari to Terminal Dogma's most inner sanctum.  
“丽……你终究还是来了。约定的时刻到了。我们走吧。”她凝视着她出生的地方那破败的墙壁，身后传来他柔和的声音呼唤她的名字。她转身面对他，微微点头，跟随碇源堂前往终端教条的最深处。

Though as they approached the crucified form of Lilith, it was clear that they were not alone:  
尽管当他们接近被钉十字架的莉莉丝时，显然他们并非独自一人：

"I've been waiting for you." Dr Ritsuko Akagi said as she stood up from where her feet had been splashing in the pool that surrounded Lilith and pulled out her R-92 five-cylinder revolver. Small and compact, perfect for concealing in a lab coat in case anything happened.  
“我一直在等你。”赤木律子博士说着，从她双脚浸泡在围绕莉莉丝的池子中的位置站起身，掏出了她的 R-92 五筒左轮手枪。小巧紧凑，非常适合藏在实验室外套里以防万一。

Gendo Ikari maintained both his silence and unreadable expression at this turn of events. It had been a calculated risk releasing her from her cell. It had been a devil's bargain, like so many others he had made throughout his life to reach this one goal he had. Since Gendo didn't deign to speak any last words Ritsuko resumed:  
碇源堂保持着沉默和难以捉摸的表情，面对这一突如其来的转折。释放她出狱是一个经过计算的风险。这是一个魔鬼的交易，就像他一生中为了达到这个唯一目标所做的许多其他交易一样。既然碇源堂不屑于说任何遗言，赤木律子继续说道：

"This is my atonement." Dr. Akagi said as her eyes narrowed down the sights, her hand steady with determination and cold fury in her eyes as she pulled the trigger. The good doctor had briefly considered self-destructing the entire base as vengeance upon the elder Ikari for all he'd done to her but…then she had thought of Misato and how her unruly purple-headed drunk of a friend was trying everything she could to keep everyone alive and she just couldn't do it. Not while there was still even the faintest glimmer of hope that this all might end without these bastards getting what they wanted.  
“这是我赎罪的方式。”赤木律子博士说道，她的眼睛紧盯着瞄准器，手中稳稳地扣动扳机，眼中闪烁着坚定的决心和冰冷的怒火。这位善良的医生曾短暂考虑过将整个基地自毁，以此向碇源堂复仇，他对自己所做的一切……但随后她想到了美里，想到她那不羁的紫发醉鬼朋友正竭尽全力保护每一个人，她实在无法这么做。只要还有一丝希望，这一切能在不让他们得逞的情况下结束，她就无法下手。

So, with that Akagi let nine millimeters of lead fly towards her former lover's head…only for that hateful orange octagon to appear.  
于是，赤木律子让九毫米的子弹射向她前恋人的头部……却只见那可恨的橙色八角形出现。

'Whaa…?!' Ritsuko's mind cursed as her index finger depressed the trigger three more times in quick succession, each of the rounds pinging off the AT Field Rei projected from her outstretched hand. Though before she could fire a fourth time, and empty the revolver, a ricocheting shot caught her in the right shoulder. Her voice crying out in pain as her legs crumpled beneath her and the pistol clattered across the ground.  
“什……？！”律子的脑海中咒骂着，她的食指迅速连续扣动扳机三次，每一发子弹都撞上了绫波零从伸出的手中投射出的 AT 力场，发出叮叮声。然而在她能射出第四发并清空左轮手枪之前，一颗跳弹击中了她的右肩。她痛苦地叫出声来，双腿一软跪倒在地，手枪也随之滑落。

"Rei…Why?" The faux blonde asked as tears of shame formed in her eyes. But the First Child remained silent, a cold look on her face as Gendo stepped from behind her and kicked Ritsuko's sidearm into the pool of LCL. The plop echoing in the vast chamber for a time before the bearded man went over to where Dr. Akagi was collapsed on the ground, her left hand desperately trying to stop the bleeding.  
"丽…为什么？" 假金发女子问道，羞愧的泪水在她的眼中形成。但第一使徒保持沉默，脸上带着冷漠的表情，源渡从她身后走出来，将律子的手枪踢进了 LCL 池中。扑通声在广阔的舱室内回响了一段时间，然后留着胡子的男人走到赤木博士倒地的地方，她正拼命用左手试图止住流血。

"Ritsuko…" The lover of both her and her mother began, as he crouched down and took off his glasses to look into her eyes as he said: "I truly…" The rest of Ikari's words were lost in the emptiness of time and broken hearts.  
"律子…" 既是她也是她母亲的情人开始说道，他蹲下来摘下眼镜，注视着她的眼睛说："我真的…" 源渡的话语消失在时间的空虚和破碎的心中。

"Liar." Ritsuko said, even as a small smile formed on her face as Gendo stood back up and walked over to Rei, removing the white glove from his right hand and revealing the embryonic from of Adam he had fused with:  
"骗子。" 律子说道，尽管她的脸上形成了一丝微笑，源渡站起身来走向丽，脱下右手上的白色手套，露出了他与亚当融合的胚胎形态：

"I am already one with Adam, this is the only way to be reunited with Yui. Only through the forbidden union of Adam and Lilith." Gendo monologued not even sparing a glance at the crying form of the woman he'd manipulated to make this day happen, though he did look up towards the darkened ceiling and the multitude of arrayed forces beyond that were hellbent on stopping him. "We need to hurry Rei, bring down our AT Fields, the walls of the heart. Make our hearts whole, cast aside our unneeded flesh, unify all souls into one and let us go to where Yui waits."  
"我已经与亚当合为一体，这是唯一能与唯重聚的方式。只有通过亚当与莉莉丝的禁忌结合。" 碇源堂自言自语，连看都不看一眼那个被他操纵以促成今日局面的哭泣女子，尽管他确实抬头望向昏暗的天花板和外面众多誓要阻止他的力量。"我们必须加快速度，绫波，放下我们的 AT 力场，心灵之墙。让我们的心完整，抛弃不必要的肉体，将所有灵魂统一为一个，让我们去到唯等待的地方。"

"Rei! Don't do this! Think of everyone you'll hurt!" Ritsuko screamed through burning tears, her voice sounding as if it was trying to claw away at the reality before her.  
"绫波！不要这样做！想想你会伤害到的所有人！" 律子泪流满面地尖叫，她的声音仿佛在试图撕裂眼前的现实。

"Dr Akagi," Rei uttered the first words she had spoken since this drama began, her soft tones dashing away Ritsuko's hope: "It has to be this way."  
"赤木博士，" 绫波吐出了自这场戏剧开始以来的第一句话，她柔和的语调粉碎了律子的希望："必须这样走下去。"

As Gendo, unfazed by the exchange, lifted up his hand in front of Rei and over her heart, Ritsuko curled up into the fetal position and wished she had the last bullet in her gun for herself.  
当碇源堂对这场交流无动于衷，举起手放在绫波面前并覆盖在她心脏上方时，赤木律子蜷缩成胎儿姿势，希望自己手枪里还有最后一颗子弹留给自己。

"Now, Rei, take me to Yui." Gendo said as his hand containing the First Angel passed through Rei's AT Field making its way into her unused womb, bonding with the soul of Lilith within in order to create a bridge between the worlds of physical and metaphysical biology, a veritable Axis Mundi.  
“现在，绫波，带我去见唯。”碇源堂说道，他手中握着第一使徒，穿透了绫波的 AT 力场，将其送入她未曾使用的子宫，与莉莉丝的灵魂结合，以创造连接物质与精神生物学领域的真正世界轴心。

But just as the bond was cemented Rei spoke again:  
但就在这种联系被巩固之际，绫波再次开口：

"I am not your doll."  
"我不是你的玩偶。"

"What!?" Gendo managed as Rei's AT Field rushed back into place between her and him, taking Adam fully into Rei's body and severing his right arm in the process. The force sending Gendo flying onto his back, wounded and broken.  
"什么！？" Gendo 勉强说出，Rei 的 AT 力场再次在她和他之间展开，将亚当完全纳入 Rei 体内，同时切断了他的右臂。这股力量将 Gendo 击飞，背部着地，身受重伤。

"Rei.?! Why?" A shocked Gendo Ikari mirrored Ritsuko's earlier query as he looked up at Rei's cold stare. The First Child stood there for a moment in silence, partly to think, and partly to let her physiology adapt to the new power within it.  
"丽？为什么？" 震惊的 Gendo Ikari 重复了 Ritsuko 之前的疑问，抬头望着 Rei 冷漠的目光。第一适格者静静地站在那里片刻，一方面是为了思考，另一方面是为了让她的生理机能适应体内新涌入的力量。

"Because I am not you, I am me. And I do not want Ikari…" Clearly referring to the younger rather than the elder as she walked over to his flat form: "…or the one he loves to be hurt." Rei said as she looked down at a defeated Gendo Ikari and then up to the ceiling and the battle raging kilometers above as Ritsuko's hysterical, unhinged laughter filled Lilith's hold.  
"因为我不是你，我是我。我不希望碇……" 显然指的是年轻的而非年长的，她走向他平躺的身体："……或是他所爱的人受到伤害。" 绫波说，低头看着战败的碇源堂，然后抬头望向天花板，那里是千米之上的激战，同时赤木律子的歇斯底里、失控的笑声充斥着莉莉丝的内部。

**The Hills Overlooking the Battle of Megiddo  
俯瞰马吉多战役的山丘**

General Kuribayashi of the JSSDF looked at the unfolding battle between biomechanical titans, his disposition becoming more and more grim with each passing second. More than half the MP Evas had been lost and the rogue units of NERV HQ showed no signs of slowing down.  
日本自卫队总司令栗林忠道看着生物机械巨人之间的战斗愈演愈烈，他的心情每况愈下。超过一半的 MP 使徒已经损失，而 NERV 总部叛变的单位丝毫没有减速的迹象。

They still outnumbered the purple and red one two to one and were trying to press that advantage, momentarily drawing the two piloted Evas apart with their combined attacks. But the General had seen enough war to know what inevitable defeat felt like.  
他们依然以二对一的数量优势压制着紫色和红色的机体，试图通过联合攻击来扩大这一优势，暂时将两台有人驾驶的 EVA 分开。但将军历经无数战役，深知何为不可避免的失败。

"If this keeps up, we'll utterly and completely fail." He whispered under his breath as he put the binoculars, he'd been observing the battle with down.  
“如果继续这样下去，我们将彻底失败。”他低声自语，放下了一直用来观察战况的望远镜。

"Sir?" a subordinate asked from behind him in the command post.  
“长官？”指挥所内，一名部下在他身后询问道。

"Order the artillery batteries to standby."  
"命令炮兵连队待命。"

"Sir!" "是，长官！"

'They likely won't do anything to the Evas directly, but it might give the white ones an opening.' The General thought as he scanned a map of Tokyo-3, comparing where the battle was taking place to the known shelter locations.  
“他们可能不会直接对 Eva 机体采取行动，但这或许能为白色机体创造机会。”将军一边思索，一边审视着东京-3 的地图，将战斗发生地点与已知的避难所位置进行对比。

"Grid square kilo-foxtrot will be the kill box." The General said sternly, pushing his compassion to the side as an aide put hash marks on the map while another relayed the coordinates to the assembled forces.  
“网格区域 kilo-foxtrot 将作为击杀区。”将军严肃地说道，将同情心暂时搁置一边，一位副官在地图上标记了哈希标记，同时另一位将坐标传达给集结的部队。

"Sir! You might want to look at this before you give that order." A newcomer said as he entered the camouflaged command post, his right hand extending a small drive.  
“长官！在您下达那个命令之前，您可能想先看看这个。”一名新来者说着走进了伪装指挥所，右手递出一个微型驱动器。

"And just who are you?!" Lieutenant-Colonel Akechi challenged as he drew his sidearm and along with the command staff security held the stranger at gunpoint. He wore a military uniform, but all the identification and unit patches had been removed, and while he appeared to be unarmed appearances were seldom reality.  
“你究竟是谁？！”秋吉中校质问道，同时拔出手枪，与指挥部的安保人员一起将陌生人用枪指住。他穿着军装，但所有的身份标识和部队徽章都被移除，尽管他看似手无寸铁，但外表往往具有欺骗性。

"My, my you've come up in the world," the stranger addressed the General, paying no heed to the Lieutenant-Colonel or the soldiers' rifles, "Last time I saw you in Borneo you were just a Colonel."  
"哎呀，你真是飞黄腾达了，"陌生人向将军打招呼，对中校和士兵们的步枪视若无睹，"上次在婆罗洲见到你时，你还只是个上校呢。"

"Kaji?!" General Kuribayashi exclaimed in surprise. The AWOL spy's face was smooth shaven, and his head lacked the distinctive ponytail, but that smile was unmistakable: "I almost didn't recognize the man I owe my life."  
"加治？！"栗林忠道将军惊呼道。这名擅离职守的间谍脸庞光滑无须，头上也没有标志性的马尾，但那笑容却让人一眼认出："我差点没认出这位救命恩人。"

"That's why us cloak-and-dagger types always keep extra hair we can cut off if we need to disappear." Ryoji Kaji said as he took off his borrowed helmet and the security staff looked at the General who motioned them to lower their guns.  
"这就是为什么我们这些搞谍报工作的总是留着额外的头发，必要时可以剪掉以便消失。"加治芳雄说着摘下借来的头盔，安保人员看向将军，将军示意他们放下枪。

"I know you wouldn't be here unless it was the real deal, so let's see what's on that thing." The General said as he tapped a young corporal to stand up from a military laptop and Kaji held out the drive he had retrieved in the last hour from a small shack in the forested mountains of Tokyo-3 with false floorboards and a battery powered transmitter.  
"我知道你不会无缘无故来这里，让我们看看那东西里有什么。" 将军说着，示意一名年轻的下士从军用笔记本电脑前起身，而加持则拿出了他在过去一小时从东京-3 郊外森林中的一间小屋里取出的驱动器，那里有假地板和电池供电的发射器。

"Sir are you sure this is wise?" Lieutenant-Colonel Akechi protested.  
"长官，您确定这样做明智吗？" 秋吉中校提出异议。

"All batteries loaded and standing by General!" Sergeant Yamato hollered out from his station at the communications array.  
"所有电池已装载完毕，随时待命，将军！" 山本军士在通信阵列站台上大声报告。

"Tell them to hold!" Kuribayashi said as the data from the drive loaded onto the computer. The General's eyes skimmed through the torrent of data presented. He was no scientist, so the nuances flew over his head, but the parts he did understand were incontrovertible proof that he, that Japan, that Mankind, had been fooled.  
"让他们稳住！" 栗林说，随着硬盘数据加载到电脑上。将军的眼睛迅速扫过呈现的海量数据。他并非科学家，所以那些细微之处他无法理解，但他所明白的部分是无可辩驳的证据，证明他，日本，乃至全人类，都被愚弄了。

As the look on the General's face grew more and more foreboding the Lieutenant-Colonel made his way as stealthily as possible to the communications array and thought of the envelop of crisp, freshly printed yen sitting in his desk back at base and the person who'd given it to him:  
随着将军脸上的表情越来越阴沉，中校尽可能悄无声息地走向通信阵列，心中想着基地里他办公桌抽屉中那一叠崭新印刷的日元，以及给他这笔钱的那个人：

"_NERV mustn't be allowed to succeed." His SEELE handler had said as they sat in a non-descript Pre-Second Impact car._  
"NERV 绝不能成功。" 他的 SEELE 联络人在第二次冲击前的无名汽车里坐着时曾这样说道。

"_Understood." The Lieutenant-Colonel had said as he stuffed the envelop in his jacket and was about to leave before a hand on his arm stopped him._  
"明白了。" 中校说着将信封塞进夹克，正要离开时，一只手搭在了他的手臂上。

"_Do_ _**everything**_ _in your power to make it so. We can bury any problems that arise." The handler emphasized, clearly wanting to get the point across._  
"尽你所能去实现它。我们能掩盖任何出现的问题。" 处理者强调道，显然是想让这个观点深入人心。

"_Like with that village?" The Lieutenant-Colonel's eyes narrowed as he remembered how he'd come into their service as a young captain on a peacekeeping mission in Java. He knew a blackmail threat when he heard it. If they could make war crimes allegations go away, the opposite was also likely true._  
"就像那个村庄那样？" 中校的眼睛眯了起来，他想起了自己作为一名年轻的少校，在爪哇执行维和任务时是如何加入他们的。他知道什么是敲诈威胁。如果他们能让战争罪行的指控消失，那么反过来也很可能是真的。

"_Exactly." The handler said with a smile as he let go of the Colonel's jacket._  
"正是如此。" 处理者微笑着松开了上校的夹克。

"Get me the Prime Minister! Now!" General Kuribayashi ordered Sergeant Yamato as he stood up from the laptop. But before the sergeant could comply Lieutenant-Colonel Akechi grabbed the receiver and yelled to the artillery still standing by:  
"给我接首相！立刻！" 栗林中将命令山藤军曹，同时从笔记本电脑前站起身。但军曹还未行动，秋地中佐便抢过话筒，向仍在待命的炮兵大喊：

"All Batteries fire! Fire at the Evas!"  
"所有炮台开火！向 EVA 射击！"

And like dutiful soldiers they did.  
他们就像尽职的士兵一样照做了。

Asuka and Shinji had been forced apart by the constant attacks of the remaining MP Evas who were now double teaming them.  
由于剩余的 MP Evas 不断发起攻击，明日香和真嗣被迫分开，现在这些敌人正联手对付他们。

"Damn it!" Asuka said as she held her captured blade in front of her as both her opponents struck towards her at once, teeth gritting and muscle bundles in her precious Eva bulging as the monstrous beasts tried to break her guard.  
“该死！”明日香喊道，她紧握着被俘获的刀挡在身前，面对两个对手同时向她发起攻击，她咬紧牙关，珍贵的 Eva 肌肉紧绷，试图抵挡住这些怪兽的猛攻。

Then Asuka's threat display glowed with hundreds, thousands even, of angry red dots.  
随后，明日香的威胁展示闪烁着数百、甚至数千个愤怒的红点。

"Oh no…" Asuka said quietly as her mind processed the sight. The incoming rockets and shells weren't a threat to her, but she knew that a shelter couldn't take a direct hit from some of those.  
“哦不……”明日香轻声说道，她的思维在处理这一景象。来袭的火箭和炮弹对她构不成威胁，但她知道，一些直接命中对掩体来说是致命的。

Deciding quickly what she had to do Asuka's strength surged as a fresh round of adrenaline hit her blood and she cried out:  
迅速决定她必须做什么，明日香的力量随着新一轮肾上腺素的涌入而激增，她大声呼喊：

"Out of my way!" As she twisted her captured blade, breaking the MP Eva's attack on her and sending one of the false lances careening three blocks down the street and into a building. The Eva that had kept hold of its weapon however, fared worse in the long run, as its guard was open, and it was left vulnerable to Asuka's next strike.  
“让开！”她扭动被俘的刀刃，破解了 MP Eva 对她的攻击，并将一支假长矛甩出三个街区，直插入一栋建筑。然而，那个一直紧握武器的 Eva，最终情况更糟，因为它的防御被打开，暴露在明日香的下一击之下。

The red behemoth jumped up with its blade held above its four-eyed head before bringing it crashing down and splitting the unguarded cranium of the white beast. But Asuka didn't stop there, she followed through and bisected the MP Eva from head to bottom, two symmetrical halves falling apart from each other and leaving a meter deep puddle of blood.  
红色巨兽跃起，刀举过四眼头顶，猛然劈下，将白色怪物的无防备头颅一分为二。但明日香并未就此罢手，她顺势而下，将 MP Eva 从头到脚劈成两半，两块对称的残躯分离，留下一米深的血泊。

But Asuka didn't give her victory a second thought, she dropped the captured lance and jumped on top of the tallest building she could find and hastily extended her AT Field to its maximum strength and range but…  
但明日香并未多想胜利，她丢下俘获的长矛，跳上她能找到的最高建筑，急忙将 AT 力场扩展到最大强度和范围，但……

"It's not enough." Asuka realized as the rockets and shells were seconds away from impact: "Please, I don't want anyone to die." Asuka pleaded as her mind scoured the Eva for one she knew could give her the power she needed: "Help me…mama."  
"这还不够。" 当火箭和炮弹在几秒内即将击中时，明日香意识到："请，我不想任何人死去。" 明日香恳求着，她的思绪在 Eva 中搜寻着那个她知道能赋予她所需力量的人："帮帮我……妈妈。"

The AT Field expanded in scope and power to the degree that it made even Ramiel or Zeruel's seem weak. The incoming ordnance impacting harmlessly against the rippling orange field as hundreds of lives were spared.  
AT 力场扩大了范围和强度，以至于让拉米尔或塞鲁尔的力场都显得微弱。来袭的弹药在波动的橙色力场前无害地撞击，数百条生命得以幸免。

"We did it mama." Asuka said in her final moments.  
"我们做到了，妈妈。" 明日香在最后的时刻说道。

For she had silhouetted herself against the skyline and her remaining opponent had retrieved its weapon. The false Lance of Longinus piercing Evangelion Unit-02's back in the same spot Shinji had kissed the day before, right behind her heart.  
因为她将自己映衬在天际线上，而她仅存的对手已经取回了武器。那把伪朗基努斯之枪刺穿了 EVA 二号机的背部，正是前一天真嗣亲吻过的地方，就在她的心脏后方。

Asuka's lips managed to let out a breathless gasp as the red biomechanical android tumbled down.  
随着红色生物机械安卓的翻滚，明日香的嘴唇勉强发出了一声无力的喘息。

Silence filled Tokyo-3 for a brief moment before a heartrending scream filled its empty streets followed a moment later by a sonic boom as the true Lance of Longinus ripped through the atmosphere as it returned from Lunar orbit. The Lance tearing the MP Eva that had landed the mortal blow in half before the Lance reached its true destination, the hand of Unit-01.  
东京-3 陷入了短暂的寂静，随后一声撕心裂肺的尖叫响彻空荡的街道，紧接着是音爆声，真正的朗基努斯之枪从月球轨道返回，撕裂了大气层。长枪将给予致命一击的量产 EVA 撕成两半，随后抵达了它的真正目的地——初号机的手中。

The purple mech sprouted orange wings too jagged and pointy to be heavenly as the air seemed to swirl and churn about a soul overcome with sorrow as the last two of the Mass Production Evangelions cowered in fear at what lay before them.  
那台紫色机甲生出了橙色的翅膀，边缘过于参差不齐，尖锐得不像天赐之物，空气中似乎回旋着一股因悲伤而翻腾的灵魂，最后两台量产型福音战士在恐惧中蜷缩，面对着它们眼前的存在。

The Devil Incarnate. 恶魔化身。

"I must go home." Rei said, looking at the crucified white behemoth and knowing what she must do.  
“我必须回家。”绫波说，凝视着被钉在十字架上的白色巨兽，心中明白自己必须做什么。

The last of SEELE's dolls were shredded in mere seconds.  
SEELE 的最后一批玩偶在几秒内就被撕成了碎片。

They were in his way.  
他们挡了他的路。

He had to get to her.  
他必须赶到她身边。

If he could just get to her, she would be alright.  
如果他能赶到她身边，她就会没事的。

She had to be alright.  
她必须没事。

She just had to, there wasn't any point if she wasn't.  
她必须没事，如果她不是这样的话，一切都没有意义了。

These thoughts stabbed through Shinji's head as he ran across the street, covered in the blood and gore that was all that remained of the last MP Evas.  
这些念头如利刃般刺穿了真嗣的脑海，他横穿街道，浑身沾满了上一批量产 EVA 仅存的血肉与污秽。

He jumped up the unmoving red form of Asuka's precious Unit-02, undoing the manual release on her entry plug and opening the cylinder, paying no heed to burned hands.  
他跃上阿斯卡心爱的二号机那纹丝不动的红色身躯，解除了她插入栓的手动释放装置，打开了圆柱体，全然不顾烧伤的双手。

"Asuka!" Shinji called out, but there was no answer.  
“明日香！”真嗣呼喊着，但无人应答。

"Asuka! Asuka! Come on wake up! Asuka! Asuka!" Shinji tried desperately, his mind in denial as his hands shook her unmoving form as fresh tears formed in his eyes as the truth clawed its way into his conscious thoughts.  
“明日香！明日香！快醒醒！明日香！明日香！” 真嗣拼命呼唤着，心中拒绝接受现实，双手颤抖着摇晃她毫无反应的身体，泪水再次涌出眼眶，真相如利爪般侵入他的意识。

But just then he noticed a shadow in the LCL and looked to see who was standing in the doorway to the entry plug.  
但就在这时，他注意到 LCL 中有一道阴影，转头看向插入栓门口站着的人。

"Rei…Asuka she's not…I…don't…I don't know what to do." Shinji sobbed, his tears falling and causing ripples in the LCL as he cradled the German redhead in his arms.  
“绫波…明日香她…我…不知道…我不知道该怎么办。” 真嗣啜泣着，泪水滴落，在 LCL 中激起涟漪，他紧紧抱着怀中的德国红发少女。

"Pilot Sohryu is not yet lost." Rei said simply as she made her way into the entry plug and stood next to Asuka's seated body.  
"飞行员惣流还未迷失。" 丽简单地说着，走进了插入栓，站在坐在座位上的明日香旁边。

"What!? Can you help her?!" Shinji said with a desperate look in his eyes, his heart such a mixture of hope and anguish he didn't notice there were two Reis. The one he was talking to who was nude, and a second one dressed in their school's uniform.  
"什么！？你能帮她吗？！" 真嗣眼中带着绝望的神情说道，他的内心充满了希望与痛苦，以至于没有注意到有两个丽。一个赤裸着身体，另一个则穿着他们学校的制服。

"She will have to make the choice." The nude Rei said as she brought her finger to Asuka Langley Sohryu's forehead.  
"她必须做出选择。" 赤裸的丽说着，将手指放在了明日香·兰格雷的额头上。

"Rei…I don't understand." A bewildered Shinji said before noticing the second uniformed Rei approach him and place her index finger on his forehead before his vision went white.  
“丽……我不明白。”真嗣困惑地说道，随即注意到另一个身着制服的丽向他走来，将食指放在他的额头上，随后他的视线变得一片空白。

"They will all have to make the choice."  
“他们都将不得不做出选择。”

**A/N:** So here it is. The first part of the end of ASG. I hope the wait was worth it. This chapter took so long because there were multiple, and I mean multiple rewrites and thousands of words of cut content as I wracked my brain to make this penultimate chapter tie together the disparate subplots and stay true to form while also having a good flow. Did I succeed? I don't know, that's up for you guys to decide. As always let me know what you think. The final chapter will hopefully not take as long and depending on how that goes there may also be a short epilogue.  
A/N: 这就是了。ASG 终结篇的第一部分。希望等待是值得的。这个chapter花了这么长时间，因为经历了多次，我是说多次重写，以及数千字的删减内容，我绞尽脑汁，力求将这个倒数第二的chapter中分散的支线情节串联起来，保持原貌的同时也确保良好的叙事流程。我成功了吗？我不知道，这由你们来评判。一如既往，请告诉我你们的想法。最终的chapter希望不会耗时太久，并且根据进展情况，可能还会有一个简短的尾声。

### Chapter 17 End of ASG Part 217.

_In Other Words… 换言之…_

**Nowhere yet Everywhere 无处不在却又无处可寻**

---
"_**What do you wish for?"**_  
"你希望得到什么？"

The question tumbled around in his head, overlaying a kaleidoscope of fractal memories and colors as the sense of self was atomized and reforged, until finally his eyes opened.  
这个问题在他脑海中翻滚，覆盖了一幅幅分形记忆和色彩的万花筒，随着自我意识的分解与重铸，直到最后他的眼睛睁开。

"Ayanami…" Shinji Ikari said as his gaze shifted upward and caught Rei's piercing red orbs. His foggy mind was vaguely aware of his head resting on something soft and that both of them were nude. "Am I dead, is she-"  
"绫波…" 碇真嗣说道，他的目光向上移动，与绫波丽锐利的红色眼眸相遇。他朦胧的意识隐约感觉到自己的头正枕在柔软之物上，而且两人都是赤裸的。"我死了吗，她是不是-"

"Ikari." Rei intoned calmly as the brown-haired boy laying in her arms let out a scream that could pierce heavens as he remembered.  
"真嗣。" 绫波平静地念道，怀中棕发少年发出一声撕心裂肺的尖叫，仿佛能刺穿天际，记忆如潮水般涌来。

"Asuka! Where is Asuka?!" Shinji implored as his body bolted upright and his hands pulled his hair as eyelids closed and a fresh rush of memory caused tiny teardrops to form in the corner of his eyes.  
"明日香！明日香在哪里？！" 真嗣急切地问道，身体猛地坐起，双手紧抓头发，眼睑闭合，新一波记忆涌入，眼角不禁泛起泪花。

"She is here." Rei Ayanami laconically answered. Causing Shinji to calm down and open his eyes.  
"她在这里。" 绫波零简短地回答。这让真嗣平静下来，睁开了双眼。

"Where is here?" Shinji asked as he finally took stock of where the two of them were sitting, well floating really, as it seemed that beneath them was lazily stirring water for as far as he could see, the orange sky and horizon blending together.  
"这里是哪里？" 真嗣终于开始打量起两人所在的地方，实际上是在漂浮，因为下方似乎是一片绵延至视线尽头的缓缓荡漾的水面，橙色的天空与地平线融为一体。

"A place between the sea of LCL that is the source of all life and the waking world, for this brief eternity the self has lost its shape." The avatar of Lilith explained, though most of it was lost on Shinji, though he did know this wasn't reality. That nagging sense of untruth burrowing up from his subconscious into his conscious thoughts told him as much.  
"这是一个介于生命之源的 LCL 之海与清醒世界之间的空间，在这短暂的永恒中，自我失去了形态。" 莉莉丝的化身解释道，尽管大部分内容对真嗣来说难以理解，但他确实知道这不是现实。那种从潜意识深处涌上来的不真实感，明确地告诉他这一点。

"Why?" Shinji asked as he brought his cobalt eyes back to Rei's red orbs.  
"为什么？" 真嗣问道，将他那深蓝色的眼睛重新对上绫波的红眸。

"It was the only way." Rei began as she stood up and trod upon the swirling orange waves: "You have to reclaim your lost selves on your own."  
"这是唯一的办法。" 丽站起身，踏上了翻滚的橙色波浪："你必须自己找回失去的自我。"

As soon as she spoke the words Shinji found himself in a new place. Startled, he looked around and saw he was in a bath or spa of some type. The humidity condensing on the tiled walls and floors was pervading his nostrils. It was so familiar, yet his brain couldn't decipher why, but his gut told him this place was important.  
然后，他的耳朵听到了某人的哼唱声和墙那边的泼水声。他沿着没有门的 U 形瓷砖走廊向前走，来到了开阔处。

Then, his ears heard someone humming, and water splashing from beyond the wall. He walked forward through the U-shaped tiled corridor with no door and out into the open.

There, there was a redhead in a red and white striped bikini, splashing her feet as she sat on the edge of a nearby hot spring.  
那里，有一位红发女孩穿着红白条纹比基尼，坐在附近温泉的边缘，踢着水花。

"Shinji! You finally arrived! Baka!" Asuka Langley Sohryu exclaimed in delight as she stood up and ran forward to hug a Shinji dressed in nothing but a towel.  
“真嗣！你终于来了！笨蛋！” 惣流·明日香·兰格雷兴奋地喊道，她站起身跑向前去拥抱只裹着一条毛巾的真嗣。

"Asuka!" Shinji said relieved as he wrapped his arms tight around his lover and they lost themselves in each other for a long moment.  
“明日香！” 真嗣松了口气，紧紧抱住他的爱人，两人沉浸在彼此的怀抱中，久久不能自拔。

"This place it's where we first…" Shinji said as their embrace of reunion ended, and his grey matter dug up the reason why they were here.  
"这里是我们第一次……" 真嗣在重逢的拥抱结束后说道，他的灰色脑细胞挖掘出了他们来此的原因。

"Kissed." Asuka finished his sentence for him as her lips rushed forward and covered his own.  
"接吻的地方。" 明日香替他补完了句子，她的唇迅速向前，覆盖住了他的。

But…something was wrong. Well maybe not wrong, but different. As Shinji felt the affection of the one he loved, he realized something was missing, some spark, some _je ne sais quoi_ that made this kiss different from the thousands of others they had shared.  
但……有些不对劲。也许不是错，而是不同。当真嗣感受到他所爱之人的爱意时，他意识到有些东西缺失了，某种火花，某种难以言喻的特质，使得这个吻与他们分享过的成千上万个吻有所不同。

"Don't worry, we have the rest of eternity to get it right." Asuka said as the kiss ended, clearly having felt the same thing as Shinji.  
"别担心，我们有的是时间来把它做好。" 明日香在亲吻结束后说道，显然她也感受到了与真嗣相同的东西。

"Rest of eternity…" Shinji repeated until the coin finally dropped. "You can't mean you want to stay here?!"  
"余生…" 真嗣重复着，直到他终于明白了。"你不是想说你想留在这里吧？！"

"Why not?" Asuka asked, her arms still wrapped around Shinji as she made her case, "Here there's no pain, no strife, only each other. It might be only ninety percent as good as real-life but lasts forever rather than a brief lifetime."  
"为什么不呢？" 明日香问道，她的手臂仍然环绕着真嗣，阐述着她的理由，"在这里没有痛苦，没有纷争，只有彼此。虽然可能只有现实生活九成的完美，但却能永恒持续，而不是短暂的一生。

"But it isn't real Asuka." Shinji, never the best debater, repeated what his instinct told him as his hands squeezed her shoulders, to try and convey with pathos what he could not with logos.  
"但这不是真实的明日香。" 真嗣，向来不擅长辩论，重复着本能告诉他的话，双手紧握她的肩膀，试图用情感传达他无法用逻辑表达的东西。

"But why take the risk of our one reality becoming miserable when this alternative, Instrumentality, exists?" Asuka continued her line of reasoning, her cerulean blues never wavering.  
"但为什么要冒险让我们的唯一现实变得悲惨，当这个替代方案，人类补完计划，存在时呢？" 明日香继续她的推理，她那蔚蓝的眼睛从未动摇。

"There's no guarantee it will!" He countered with a piercing cobalt look.  
"这没有保证会那样！" 他用锐利的目光反驳道。

"It's happened before." Asuka said, her eyes hidden by the shadow of her bangs as she let go of Shinji: "You couldn't protect me once, which is why we're here now." She continued as her hands went to cover the heart that had been pierced by the false lance. "Now you want to go back to the one place where that can happen again!" She screamed at the top of her lungs as her burning gaze locked onto Shinji's flagging visage, her azure blues softening, almost glinting with condensing tears as she continued "Or…where I can feel what it's like to lose you…"  
"这种事以前发生过。" 明日香说道，她的眼睛被刘海的阴影遮住，她放开了真嗣："你曾经没能保护我，这就是我们现在在这里的原因。" 她继续说着，双手捂住那颗被假矛刺穿的心。"现在你却想回到那个可能再次发生这种事的地方！" 她声嘶力竭地喊道，炽热的目光锁定在真嗣疲惫的面容上，她那湛蓝的眼眸变得柔和，几乎闪烁着凝聚的泪光，继续说道："或者……让我感受失去你的滋味……"

"Don't abandon me!" Shinji shouted in the heat of the moment as his heart felt the thing most important to him slipping away, like cold water through his fingers, an icy chill piercing his heart.  
"不要抛弃我！" 真嗣在激动中喊道，他的心感觉到最重要的东西正从指间溜走，就像冰冷的水流过，一股寒意刺穿了他的心。

"Abandon you!? You're the one wanting to leave me here!" Asuka responded indignantly, her hands going to her hips as her gaze hardened, hiding the pain in her own heart with anger.  
"抛弃你！？是你想离开我！" 明日香愤愤不平地回应，双手叉腰，目光变得坚硬，用愤怒掩盖自己心中的痛苦。

"I never said that!" His tone toughening as his hands balled into fists at his sides.  
"我从没说过那种话！" 他的语气变得强硬，双手紧握成拳，垂在身侧。

"You're so transparent, you're just afraid of losing your toy." Asuka said as her eyes closed, and she adopted a haughty tone as her face turned away.  
"你真是太明显了，只是害怕失去你的玩具罢了。" 明日香说着，眼睛闭上，脸上露出傲慢的表情，转过头去。

"Just listen to me!" Shinji pleaded as he reached out a hand to try and grasp her shoulder, but his fingers clasped nothing but emptiness.  
"就听我说一次吧！" 真嗣恳求着，伸出手试图抓住她的肩膀，但手指只抓到了一片虚无。

As their argument intensified neither were aware of how their surroundings were slowly darkening, the façade of the hot springs giving way to an amorphous void where man and woman stood upon opposing banks.  
随着争论愈演愈烈，两人都未曾察觉到周围环境正逐渐变暗，温泉的外观逐渐让位于一个无定形的虚空，男女双方站在对立的岸边。

"You boys are only ever happy with your existence if you've got a girl to fuck." Asuka continued, though not just her voice sounded in Shinji's ears and mind. He could faintly identify Misato's, Dr. Akagi's, and others besides, within a whole host of other feminine voices added to it, their inhibitions lifted with the merging of all souls. Their disgust at male single-mindedness evident.  
“你们这些男孩只有在有女孩可以上的时候才会对自己的存在感到满意。”明日香继续说道，尽管不仅仅是她的声音在真嗣的耳朵和脑海中响起。他可以模糊地辨认出美里、赤城博士以及其他人的声音，还有许多其他女性的声音加入其中，随着所有灵魂的融合，她们的抑制力消失了。她们对男性单一思维的厌恶显而易见。

"As if girls are better?! Keeping things ambiguous! The moment it becomes the least bit difficult or boring you move on!" Shinji parried, with Hyuga's, Kaji's and his father's voice adding to the chorus venting their frustration at female opaqueness.  
“好像女孩们就更好似的？！保持事情的模糊不清！一旦变得最微小的困难或无聊，你们就转移目标！”真嗣反驳道，日向、加持和他父亲的嗓音也加入了合唱，发泄着对女性模糊性的不满。

"You just don't get it!" The female choir harrumphed as the gap grew wider.  
"你就是不懂！" 女声合唱团哼了一声，间隙愈发扩大。

"You never tell us anything yet expect us to understand!" Shinji's voice lost in the gestalt as the anger boiled over.  
"你从不告诉我们任何事，却指望我们理解！" 真嗣的声音在集体意识中迷失，愤怒如沸水般翻腾。

"Men, as if you could ever understand." The first word spat as if it were an insult, the mass's tone bleeding with resentment as the gap reached its widest point.  
"男人，好像你们能理解似的。" 第一个词如吐唾沫般带着侮辱，群体的语气中流露出怨恨，间隙达到了最宽点。

"Then why am I here?!" The exasperated Shinji and his cohort screamed at the void.  
“那我为什么在这里？！” 沮丧的真嗣和他的同伴对着虚空尖叫。

"Anyone will do." Asuka's and the other disembodied voices accused with bitterness, continuing without even seeming to regard their opposite's question: "She doesn't even need to be cold for you to move on!" Kyoko's and the Akagis' voices taking center stage with that last line before silence fell, dragging on until two voices broke the darkness.  
“任何人都可以。” 明日香和其他无实体的声音带着苦涩指责道，似乎完全不顾对方的提问继续说：“她甚至不需要对你冷淡，你就能继续前进！” 直到沉默降临，拖拽着直到两个声音打破了黑暗，最后一句由绫子和赤城家的声音主导。

"That's not true." “那不是真的。”

"That's not right." "那不对。"

The umbral black of mistrust and disgust that had consumed the hot springs was replaced by low light emanating from a singular fixture in a storage room turned bedroom.  
曾经吞噬温泉的疑虑与厌恶的幽暗已被一间改造成卧室的储藏室中散发出的微弱灯光所取代。

"_Are you sure about this Asuka?" The past form of Shinji Ikari asked._  
"你确定吗，明日香？" 过去的碇真嗣问道。

"_I followed the instructions, so everything should be fine." Asuka answered as she took one last look at the package she'd gotten from Hikari and placed it on the nearby desk along with her ruby neural adapters, the last piece of clothing between the two of them and lay down on Shinji's bed._  
"我按照指示做了，所以一切应该都没问题。" 明日香回答道，她最后看了一眼从光那里收到的包裹，将其与她的红宝石神经适配器一起放在旁边的桌子上，这是两人之间仅剩的衣物，然后躺在了真嗣的床上。

"This is…" Instrumentality Asuka began as she recognized the scene before her.  
"这是……" 神格化明日香开始说道，她认出了眼前的场景。

"The first time we truly became one." Instrumentality Shinji finished for her as his mind pulled up fragments of sensation of that day.  
"我们第一次真正融为一体的那一刻。" 神格化真嗣为她补充道，他的思绪中浮现出那天感觉的碎片。

_Shinji straddled his lying lover. The two gazing into each other's eyes with timid smiles on their faces as lips drew towards one another like magnets, their kiss sending waves of joy coursing through their bodies. With their lips still merged Asuka felt a tickle on her thigh as Shinji's long, nimble fingers grasped and gently pushed her legs apart to reveal her most private place.  
真嗣跨坐在躺着的恋人身上。两人羞涩地微笑着，凝视着彼此的眼睛，双唇如同磁铁般缓缓靠近，他们的吻让喜悦的波澜在体内涌动。当他们的唇瓣依旧相贴时，明日香感觉到大腿上的一丝痒意，真嗣修长灵巧的手指握住她的腿，温柔地分开，露出她最私密的地方。_

_Their kiss broke and both lovers rested their foreheads against each other as Shinji brought his right hand up between them before wetting the tips of his fingers with their merged saliva from his mouth.  
他们的吻分开，两位恋人额头相抵，真嗣将右手伸到两人之间，用他们混合的唾液湿润了指尖。_

'_He's learning.' Asuka's past self, thought with glee, as her eyes closed in anticipation of feeling his fingers on her pink petals._  
'他在学习。'明日香过去的自我带着喜悦想道，她的眼睛闭上，期待着他的手指触碰她粉嫩的花瓣。

_Though she was surprised when she felt radiating pleasure not just from her lower lips but also her nipples as Shinji proved men too were capable of multi-tasking as his mouth kissed her breasts while his right index finger played with her labia, tracing the curves on the outer alabaster folds and eliciting the inner pink folds to emerge as Asuka's body heated up in response to Shinji's efforts.  
尽管她感到惊讶，因为不仅下唇感受到辐射般的愉悦，连乳头也感受到了，这证明真嗣也能同时处理多项任务——他的嘴亲吻着她的乳房，而他的右手食指则在她的阴唇上嬉戏，描绘着外侧象牙般褶皱的曲线，引出内侧粉嫩的褶皱，随着明日香的身体因真嗣的努力而升温。_

_Paradise was not without its problems though as an overeager Shinji attempted to push his bone-dry boner into her.  
然而，天堂并非没有问题，因为过于急切的真嗣试图将他干涩的勃起推进她的体内。_

"_Sorry" Shinji said instinctively as he saw Asuka wince and withdrew his cockhead, quickly wetting his fingers again to add lubrication to his member._  
“对不起。”真嗣本能地说道，看到明日香皱眉后，他迅速收回龟头，再次湿润手指，为自己的阴茎添加润滑。

"_Just be sure to remember next time." Asuka said as a smile replaced her earlier grimace, and she kissed the tip of his nose as his member lay at her entrance._  
“下次记得就好。”明日香说着，之前的愁容被微笑取代，她吻了吻他的鼻尖，他的分身正抵在她的入口。

_As they joined together properly both were taken aback by how different the feeling was to the half dozen or so other times, they had made love previously.  
当他们真正结合在一起时，两人都被这种感觉与之前的五六次截然不同所震惊。_

_Shinji felt her hot, wet folds press directly onto his bare cock, drawing him it seemed in ever deeper into her depths. While Asuka's body was able to discern the veins of his shaft and ridges of his cockhead as Shinji's tepid initial movements and the friction, they caused were still enough to send pleasure spiking up her nerves to her brain, with Shinji picking up the pace once the initial ecstasy wore off.  
真嗣感受到她炽热湿润的褶皱直接压在他的赤裸肉棒上，仿佛将他更深地吸入她的深处。而明日香的身体能感受到他阴茎上的血管和龟头的棱角，随着真嗣最初的温吞动作和由此产生的摩擦，这些都足以让快感沿着她的神经直冲大脑，而当最初的狂喜消退后，真嗣加快了节奏。_

Asuka and Shinji looked on as their past selves became one and new sets of eyes appeared.  
明日香和真嗣注视着他们过去的自己合二为一，新的眼睛随之出现。

"What is so special about this?" Lilith's avatar asked, mostly for reasons of rhetoric.  
“这有什么特别的呢？”莉莉丝的化身问道，多半是为了修辞效果。

"It's a woman's way of showing a man has her deepest level of trust." Misato chimed in with an answer as the memory from her wards played on.  
“这是女人向男人展示她最深层次信任的方式。”美里插话道，同时她守护者的记忆继续上演。

"Is there any other way two lovers could become closer?" Kaji's voice said as his form appeared next to his own lover.  
"还有什么方式能让两个恋人更加亲密呢？" 加持的声音响起，他的身影出现在他的爱人旁边。

"No form of contraceptive is ever completely effective after all." Ritsuko's tone laced with implication, though not just for the present lovers.  
"毕竟，没有任何避孕措施是百分之百有效的。" 律子的语气中带着暗示，不仅仅是对眼前的恋人。

"So, there's always a chance they may end up bound together for all eternity by the life they make together." Gendo Ikari added as his mind reminisced.  
"所以，他们总有可能因为共同创造的生命而永远绑定在一起。" 碇源堂补充道，心中回忆着往事。

As the gathered ethereal forms conversed Shinji and Asuka's lovemaking intensified.  
当聚集的灵体交谈时，真嗣和明日香的爱抚愈发激烈。

_Shinji's right hand had gone to Asuka's ass, grabbing the supple flesh of her left ass cheek and forcing her legs further apart so his member could stroke deeper into her while his left hand braced against the small wooden headboard of the tiny bed they shared. Asuka's hands meanwhile were pinned against his pectorals, fingers together like a fist but her palms open, the sweat of their bodies' exertion and burning lust beginning to pool there.  
真嗣的右手已抚上明日香的臀部，紧握她左臀柔软的肉，迫使她的双腿分得更开，以便他的欲望能更深入地探索，而他的左手则撑在他们共享的小木床的床头板上。与此同时，明日香的手被压在他的胸肌上，手指并拢如拳，但掌心张开，两人身体因激情而出的汗水开始在那里汇聚。_

_The increase in tempo of Shinji's thrust now caused the wooden headboard to strike rhythmically against the desk that stood next to the bed, filling the former storage room with that tell-tale banging that was the hallmark of lovers.  
真嗣冲刺的节奏加快，使得木制床头板有节奏地撞击着床边的书桌，这标志性的撞击声填满了曾经的储物间，成为恋人们激情的印记。_

"Is this what all man's effort is aimed at?" Rei Ayanami asked as the scene continued to play out before the gathered host.  
"这就是人类所有努力的终极目标吗？" 绫波零问道，眼前的场景继续在聚集的观众面前上演。

"Yes and No." The observers chorused.  
"既是又不是。" 观察者们齐声回应。

"All humans have the goal of becoming one with someone else to alleviate the loneliness in their own heart." Major Katsuragi said as she watched the unfolding scene.  
"所有人类都渴望与他人合为一体，以缓解内心的孤独。" 葛城美里少校边观看展开的场景边说道。

"But if it comes only from physical pleasure therein lies a problem." Dr. Akagi added, some bitterness seeping into her logical tone.  
“但如果这种感觉仅源于肉体的愉悦，那便存在问题。”赤木律子博士补充道，一丝苦涩渗入了她一贯理性的语调。

"The goal of becoming one with someone else, of opening your heart to them and letting down your barriers to get close to them is not sex. It is love." Maya Ibuki stated, the usual timidness in her voice replaced by certainty as Instrumentality stripped away her doubts.  
“与他人融为一体，向他们敞开心扉，放下防备去亲近他们，这目标不是性，而是爱。”碇真嗣坚定地说，通常的羞怯被确定性所取代，因为人类补完计划消除了她的疑虑。

"Validation and sense of self can only come from someone's love. Therefore, love is the ultimate goal." Hikari continued, having been drawn by the bonds she shared with those present.  
“自我认同和价值感只能来自他人的爱。因此，爱是最终目标。”光继续说道，她被与在场众人共享的纽带所吸引。

"Sex is merely the reinforcing action of love." Ryoji Kaji added as the light passed over him.  
“性只是爱的强化行为。”加持良治补充道，灯光从他身上掠过。

"Confusing the reinforcing action with the goal has caused humanity pain since the dawn of time." Gendo Ikari said, his mind always on the long view.  
“将强化行为与目标混淆，自人类诞生之初便带来了痛苦。”碇源堂说道，他的思维总是着眼于长远。

_Normally both Shinji and Asuka would have been concerned with the noise and ruckus their lovemaking was causing but both were too focused on the other to pay it more than a passing thought.  
通常，真嗣和明日香都会对他们的欢爱所造成的噪音和骚动感到担忧，但此刻两人都过于专注于对方，以至于对此只是稍加留意。_

_The intensity of Shinji's thrusts into the German redhead was causing the ruby neural adapters to move ever closer to the desk's edge, almost perfectly mirroring their owner's own nearness to orgasm.  
真嗣猛烈的撞击让德国红发少女的红色神经适配器不断向桌边靠近，几乎完美地反映了它们主人即将达到高潮的临近。_

"_Shinji!" Asuka's cry drowning out the clatter of the advanced composite of the neural adapters falling onto the floor as she reached her crescendo and Shinji felt her walls tightening around him as he managed three more erratic thrusts before his member could take no more. He had intended to pull out just to be safe but found he could not when he was living in the moment._  
“真嗣！”明日香的高喊盖过了神经适配器复合材料掉落地面的声响，她达到高潮时，真嗣感受到她体内的紧缩，他勉强又做了三次不规则的冲刺，然后他的分身再也承受不住。他本打算安全起见抽身而出，但在那一刻，他发现自己无法做到。

_Spurt after spurt of hot semen slammed into the sensitive folds of Asuka's pussy and she felt the hot, moist air of the breath Shinji had been holding wash over her ear, condensing in the curving cartilage and sending goosebumps up and down her arms and legs as her back arched.  
一股接一股的热精液猛烈地射入明日香敏感的阴部，她感受到真嗣屏住的呼吸在耳边的热气，凝结在弯曲的软骨上，激起她手臂和双腿上的鸡皮疙瘩，她的背部随之弓起。_

_Her arms went out to pull Shinji in tighter to her as his member shifted inside her, pressing and squeezing the deposited liquid between his still hard cock and her delicate walls and sending fresh pleasure into her as she felt cum inside her for the first time.  
她的双臂伸出，将真嗣拉得更紧，他的那物在她体内移动，挤压并紧贴着两人之间残留的液体，随着他依旧坚挺的阳具与她娇嫩的壁垒间的摩擦，一股新鲜的快感涌入她的身体，这是她第一次感受到体内的精液。_

_Asuka's lips shot upwards towards Shinji's as her entire body shuddered and their lips joined once more in passion.  
明日香的嘴唇急切地向上迎向真嗣的，她的整个身体因颤抖而紧绷，两人的唇再次因激情而紧密相接。_

As the escapade neared its end, two hands found one another, the contact, though feeling unnatural, spoke of a commitment, a promise.  
随着这场冒险接近尾声，两只手找到了彼此，尽管接触感觉有些不自然，却传递出一种承诺，一个誓言。

"When two lovers are together, they are a world unto themselves and are able to momentarily shut out all else." Kaji said almost authoritatively as his gaze went to the solitary orb of light above Asuka and Shinji's panting forms.  
"当两情相悦时，他们自成一个世界，能暂时隔绝一切外界干扰。" 加持几乎以权威的口吻说道，目光转向了明日香和真嗣喘息的身影上方那孤独的光球。

"Provided of course one isn't using the other…" Dr Akagi's bitterness reached its peak at that comment.  
"当然，前提是其中一方没有利用另一方……" 赤木律子博士在听到这句话时，苦涩达到了顶点。

"How can one know if that is the case without being able to directly peer into the other's soul?" Rei Ayanami asked the gathered friends and acquaintances as the scene before them began to dim. The memory made incarnate fading away as its lesson was absorbed.  
"若不能直接窥视对方的灵魂，又怎能知晓是否如此呢？" 绫波零向聚集的朋友们和熟人问道，眼前的景象开始黯淡。这段化为实体的记忆随着其教训被吸收而逐渐消逝。

"You can't, which is why trust is so important." Misato answered as Instrumentality returned to the formless void, filled with emptiness and potential at the same time.  
"你不能，这就是为什么信任如此重要。" 随着人类补完计划回归无形的虚空，同时充满了空虚与潜能。

"Is that why humans close their eyes when they kiss?" Rei Ayanami asked the gathered abyss.  
"这就是为什么人类接吻时会闭上眼睛吗？" 绫波零向聚集的深渊问道。

"Regardless the lovers must eventually return and reconcile the world's slings and arrows with the ardor of their hearts, if they are to reclaim what is theirs." Misato's voice continued the line of thought.  
"无论怎样，恋人们最终必须回归并调和世界的纷扰与他们内心的热情，如果他们要重新夺回属于自己的东西。" 葛城美子的声音继续着这个思路。

As those words sounded in the expanse it proved a harbinger, as Lilith's avatar swept her hand and split Instrumentality in twain.  
随着这些话语在广阔中回响，它预示着不祥，莉莉丝的化身挥动手臂，将人类补完计划一分为二。

**Gynaíka 女人**

Asuka Langley Sohryu opened her eyes, or had they always been open, and she only now realized it? Truly the human mind was not meant for a place devoid of natural laws and principles.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷睁开了眼睛，还是说它们一直就是睁开的，只是她现在才意识到？人类的思维确实不适合一个没有自然法则和原则的地方。

"Pilot Sohryu." A soft voice sounded.  
"Sohryu 机长。"一个柔和的声音响起。

"Wondergirl?" Asuka in her bewilderment reverted to the old nickname she had for the bluenette as she found herself standing atop the sea of LCL.  
"奇迹女孩？" 明日香在困惑中不自觉地回到了她给蓝发少女起的旧绰号，发现自己正站在 LCL 海洋之上。

"I never liked the color red." Rei Ayanami began as she stood an arm's length in front of the German redhead: "It always seemed so loathsome to me."  
"我从来不喜欢红色。" 绫波零开始说道，她站在德国红发少女面前一臂之遥的地方："它总是让我感到如此厌恶。"

"You love Shinji don't you." Asuka said, her keen intellect deciphering why she and Ayanami were in this place.  
"你爱真嗣，对吧。" 明日香说道，她敏锐的智慧解开了为何她和绫波会身处此地的谜团。

"Yes, I love Ikari." Rei finally gave voice to the feeling in her heart, after having peered into a billion souls she was finally able to understand what it was she felt and give it a name.  
"是的，我爱碇。" 绫波终于将心中的情感化为言语，在窥探了亿万灵魂之后，她终于能够理解自己的感受并为之命名。

"You're…" Asuka said with incredulity, though not from Rei's confession but from the form that had appeared behind her, bearing an uncanny resemblance to the Eva pilot though with brown hair and clearly older, her mind instantly knew her name despite never having met her in life.  
"你……" 明日香难以置信地说道，但这并非因为绫波的告白，而是因为她身后出现的身影，那身影与 EVA 驾驶员惊人地相似，尽管头发是棕色的且明显年长，她的脑海中立刻浮现出她的名字，尽管在现实中从未与她相遇。

"Was it his kindness or my genetic legacy that drew my soul to his? Or a combination of the two?" Rei asked the orange sky as her gaze tilted upwards before returning her ruby gaze to Asuka's cerulean orbs.  
"是他的善良还是我的遗传遗产吸引我的灵魂向他？还是两者的结合？" 丽向着橙色的天空问道，目光上扬后又将那红宝石般的视线转回明日香碧蓝的眼眸。

"I cannot say. I myself also don't know why my heart opened to him." Asuka answered in response, before continuing: "But I don't regret it."  
"我说不上来。我自己也不明白为什么我的心会向他敞开。" 明日香回答道，接着说："但我并不后悔。"

"So, you'll return with him? Even if it means going back to where AT fields, and the pain and loneliness they cause, exist?" Rei asked, seeking confirmation.  
"那么，你会和他一起回去吗？即使这意味着要回到存在 AT 力场，以及它们带来的痛苦和孤独的地方？" 丽追问，寻求确认。

"Yes." Asuka began, her hands clasping together as she continued: "Even though the real world may be painful and finite, it is still the place where we chose to love each other, where we chose to be happy, and where, as long as we have the will to work for it, we can live in happiness."  
"是的。" 明日香开始说道，她的双手紧握在一起，继续道："尽管现实世界可能痛苦且有限，但它仍然是我们选择相爱、选择快乐的地方，只要我们有为之努力的意愿，我们就能在那里幸福地生活。"

"I too want Ikari to be happy…but I do not think I can make him smile like you do…" Rei admitted haltingly as she sought to reconcile the feelings inside her.  
"我也希望碇君能幸福……但我不认为我能像你那样让他微笑……" 绫波零犹豫地承认，试图调和内心的情感。"

"Even with all the power of the Fruit of Wisdom and the Fruit of Life the musings of the heart can barely be grasped." Yui Ikari spoke as she came from behind Rei and the three women formed a rough trinity.  
"即使拥有智慧之果和生命之果的所有力量，心灵的沉思也只能勉强触及。" 碇唯说道，她从绫波零身后走来，三位女性形成了一个不规则的三角形。"

"Mrs. Ikari…" Asuka began, pausing as she thought of what to say.  
"碇女士……" 明日香开口道，停顿了一下，思考着该说什么。

"It's so nice to meet you in the flesh at last Ms. Sohryu, but time is short and there is someone else here with more right to you than I." Yui continued with a soft smile, her eyes darting to a space behind Asuka.  
"终于能亲自见到您，真是太好了，绫波小姐，但时间紧迫，这里还有一个人比我更有权利拥有您。" 绫波继续说道，带着温柔的微笑，目光转向明日香身后的某个地方。

"What do you me-?" Asuka began before she felt soft, warm arms embrace her from behind.  
"你这是什么意思-？" 明日香刚开口，就感觉到一双柔软温暖的手臂从背后拥抱了她。

"Mama..?!" Asuka knew who it was before she had even turned around to verify. Though when she did her heart leapt with joy as her lips let out another "Mama!" as she buried her face in the familiar bosom.  
“妈妈...？！”明日香在转身确认之前就已经知道是谁了。然而，当她真的转过身时，她的心因喜悦而跳动，她的嘴唇发出了另一个“妈妈！”，同时将脸埋进了熟悉的怀抱。

"I'm sorry I left you." Kyoko Zeppelin Sohryu, finally made whole again for this instant in Instrumentality, apologized before she said what needed to be said: "But I'm so proud of the woman you've become." Asuka's tears began to flow then and could not be stopped: "Just remember how much your Mama loves you."  
“对不起，我离开了你。”绫波零，在人类补完计划的这个瞬间终于完整再现，在说出必须说的话之前先道歉了：“但我为你成长为这样的女性感到无比骄傲。”明日香的泪水开始流淌，无法止住：“只要记住妈妈有多爱你。”

**Anthropos 人类**

Shinji Ikari found himself in a plane of existence similar to where he had awoken in Rei's arms. As his eyes gazed outward, he saw a form that broke the endless orange horizon.  
碇真嗣发现自己身处一个与他在绫波怀里醒来时相似的存在平面。当他向外望去时，他看到了一个打破无尽橙色地平线的身影。

"Father…" Shinji spoke as his mind recognized his progenitor.  
“父亲……” 真嗣开口说道，他的心认出了他的血脉之源。

"Forgive me, Shinji." Gendo Ikari pleaded, the usual coldness absent from his tone as were his glasses from his face, his walls fully lowered for the moment: "When I was with you, I only ever caused you pain."  
“原谅我，真嗣。”碇源堂恳求道，他语气中平时的冷漠不见了，脸上的眼镜也不见了，他的心墙在这一刻完全放下：“当我与你在一起时，我只给你带来了痛苦。”

"And when you were absent it was the same. Were you afraid of me?" Shinji asked the question though knew not from where it had entered his mind.  
"当你不在时，情况也是一样。你是不是怕我？" 真嗣问道，虽然他并不清楚这个问题是如何闯入他脑海的。

"Perhaps I was without realizing it, I never believed that anyone could love me. I never thought that I even deserved to be loved," Gendo admitted before continuing his soliloquy: "But Yui opened my eyes to a different path forward. And when I lost her…" Gendo answered as best he could before his voice trailed off.  
"或许我是在不知不觉中害怕，我从未相信过有人会爱我。我从未想过我甚至值得被爱，" 源度承认道，然后继续他的独白："但唯让我看到了一条不同的前进道路。而当我失去她时……" 源度尽可能地回答，但他的声音渐渐低沉下去。

"Mother." The cobalt eyed son stated as he peered into the dark eyes of his father, the orbs lacking their usual opaqueness.  
"母亲。" 这位有着钴蓝色眼睛的儿子凝视着父亲深邃的眼眸，那双眼睛失去了往日的深不可测。

"I loved her too much to simply let go, the world, even with you in it, had no meaning without her." Gendo spoke with honesty as to why he pursued the path he did.  
"我对她的爱太深，无法轻易放手，即使有你在，没有她，这个世界也毫无意义。" 碇源堂坦诚地解释了他为何选择这条道路。

"I understand." Two simple words from son to father overcoming years of estrangement.  
"我明白。" 儿子对父亲说出的这简单两个字，跨越了多年的隔阂。

"You do don't you." Gendo spoke as generations peered into each other's souls, reconciling the past as the barriers between hearts were lifted and allowed a moment of insight.  
"你确实懂了，不是吗。" 碇源堂说道，两代人的目光穿透彼此的灵魂，和解过去，心与心之间的障碍被移除，让彼此有了一瞬间的洞察。

As the silence swept across the orange waters a new form appeared, a form with red eyes and grey hair.  
当寂静掠过橙色的水面，一个新的形态出现了，那形态有着红色的眼睛和灰色的头发。

"Kaworu?! What are you doing here? How are you here?" A startled Shinji asked.  
"渚薰？！你在这里做什么？你怎么会在这里？" 惊慌的碇真嗣问道。

"My physical body may have been destroyed, but my spirit remained tethered to the world, as it's where Adam was." Kaworu Nagisa, the Seventeenth Angel, Tabris of Free Will said by way of explanation.  
"我的肉体或许已被摧毁，但我的灵魂仍与这个世界相连，因为亚当就在这里。" 第十七使徒，自由意志的化身渚薰如此解释道。

"So, you're, okay?" Shinji asked as his guilt looked to leave his heart.  
“那么，你还好吗？” 真嗣问道，他的内疚似乎从心中消散。

"Yes, I am quite alright." Tabris began before looking around at the sea of LCL which had begun to shake and swirl about them. "But we have dallied too long apart from one another in separate seas, the time has come that they be rejoined." The red-eyed boy said as he raised his right hand above his head and snapped his fingers.  
“是的，我很好。”塔布里斯开始说道，然后环顾四周，看着已经开始摇晃和旋转的 LCL 海洋。“但我们分开在不同的海洋中太久了，现在是时候让它们重新汇合了。”红眼男孩说着，将右手举过头顶，打了个响指。

**Sýnthesi 合成**

"You're sure you want to go back?" A plug-suited Shinji asked his better half.  
"你确定要回去吗？" 身穿插入栓服的 Shinji 问他的另一半。

"The world with all its problems is still the place where I met you, where we found happiness." Asuka, dressed in her own bright red plugsuit with the addition of bandaging on her back and over her heart, answered.  
"尽管这个世界充满了问题，但它依然是我遇见你的地方，我们找到幸福的地方。" Asuka 回答道，她穿着自己那件鲜艳的红色插入栓服，背部和心脏部位多了些绷带。

Just then five additional forms appeared in the cascade of shifting backgrounds and colors that the two lovers found themselves in.  
就在这时，五个额外的身影出现在这对恋人所在的那片变幻莫测的背景和色彩之中。

"That is the truest form of love." Rei Ayanami, now dressed in her school uniform, said.  
“这才是爱的最真切形式。”绫波零此刻身着校服说道。

"To trust someone even though you know they will end up hurting you, because while love may be perfect humans are imperfect. Love is not found in the absence of pain but in spite of it." Tabris, the Angel of Free Will, added as his unique position separate from the Lilin allowed a more objective view.  
“明知对方终将伤害自己却依然选择信任，因为爱虽完美，人却有缺陷。爱的真谛并非在于痛苦的不存在，而在于尽管有痛苦依然存在。”自由意志的天使塔布里斯补充道，他独特的地位使他能够以一种超然的角度看待这一切。

"Even though all humans hurt each other if given enough time, that doesn't mean love or life is pointless, that happiness is unreachable." Kyoko Zeppelin Sohryu said with a smile.  
“即便人类终将在时间的长河中彼此伤害，这并不意味着爱或生活毫无意义，幸福遥不可及。”筱竹 Kyoko Zeppelin 笑着说道。

"For so long as the Sun, and Moon, and the Earth itself exist, there is always hope to find happiness." Yui Ikari offered optimistically as she embraced a now smiling Gendo in a one-armed hug.  
“只要太阳、月亮和地球存在，就总有找到幸福的希望。” 碇唯乐观地说道，她用一只手臂拥抱着此刻微笑的碇源堂。

"For neither man nor woman was meant to walk the world alone, but rather beside one another." Gendo Ikari said as he spared a glance to the one next to him, reunited at last.  
“无论是男人还是女人，都不应该独自走在这个世界上，而是应该彼此相伴。” 碇源堂说道，他瞥了一眼身边的她，终于重逢了。

Both Shinji and Asuka rushed forward and wrapped their arms in a tight hug around their mothers, fresh tears forming in their eyes.  
真嗣和明日香都冲上前去，紧紧地抱住他们的母亲，眼中再次涌出泪水。

"Will I see you again?" Asuka was the first to give voice to the question circling in both their minds about the five gathered here.  
"我还会再见到你吗？" 明日香率先说出了两人心中关于这五人聚首的疑问。

"We'll remain with you always within your heart." Rei answered from behind them. Neither had noticed it but they had shifted and merged into one big group hug with Rei and Kaworu joining in.  
"我们将永远与你同在，在你的心中。" 绫波从他们身后回答。两人都没有注意到，他们已经聚拢并融入了这个大拥抱，绫波和渚薰也加入了进来。

"In our hearts?" Shinji asked hesitantly, the gathered family still embracing one another.  
"在我们的心中？" 真嗣犹豫地问道，这个大家庭依然紧紧相拥。

"Yes, we'll continue on as the hope that people might understand each other." Rei said as her arms squeezed both Eva pilots.  
"是的，我们将继续作为人们可能相互理解的希望。" 丽说着，双臂紧紧拥抱着两位 EVA 驾驶员。

"The hope that they will say the words, 'I love you'" Kaworu added as both Shinji and Asuka felt the guilt they still harbored melt away from their hearts.  
"希望他们能说出那句话，'我爱你'" 渚薰补充道，这让真嗣和明日香感到心中积压的愧疚逐渐消融。

Without realizing it due to the odd way of things in Instrumentality the group found themselves separated once more, though the warmth of the hug did not seem to fade.  
由于人类补完计划中事物的奇异方式，他们不知不觉中再次分离，尽管那个拥抱的温暖似乎并未消散。

"Take care of my Asuka." Kyoko bade of Shinji, the brown-haired boy nodded in return.  
"照顾好我的明日香。" 绫波对真嗣嘱咐道，这位棕发少年点头回应。

"Take care of my Shinji." Yui asked of Asuka, who intertwined her fingers with Shinji's by way of response before asking the question:  
"照顾好我的真嗣。" 唯对明日香说道，明日香随即与真嗣十指相扣作为回应，并提出了疑问：

"What will happen to the others?" The smile fading from Asuka's face as she thought about everyone else who had been taken into Instrumentality so that Rei could uphold the vow she made to herself.  
"其他人会怎么样？" 明日香想到那些被纳入人类补完计划以使绫波履行自我誓言的其他人，脸上的笑容逐渐消失。

"Life has a strong will, they will find their way back, once they have found themselves." Yui Ikari reassured them, causing the smile to return to Asuka's face.  
“生命有着强烈的意志，一旦他们找到了自我，就会找到回归的路。”碇唯安慰道，这让明日香脸上重新露出了微笑。

"Once they have made the choice."  
“一旦他们做出了选择。”

With those words the floodgates opened. For many Instrumentality took place in literally the blink of an eye, with people returning to exactly where they stood the moment before a pale-skinned schoolgirl touched their forehead and initiated Third Impact.  
随着这些话，闸门打开了。对许多人来说，人类补完计划几乎在一眨眼间就完成了，人们回到了他们被一个苍白肤色的女学生触碰额头并引发第三次冲击的那一刻所站立的地方。

That was not possible for two of the subjects though, who nevertheless would find themselves to be in a safe place.  
然而，对于其中两名实验对象来说，这并非可能之事，尽管他们最终会发现自己身处一个安全之地。

As there still needed to be a space for the sojourning souls. Rei, or the being that once was Rei Ayanami, could not use the egg in Antarctica as it was long destroyed, nor could she use the egg that the Lilin called the Geofront without ruining the city above where her earthly memories were made.  
因为仍需为那些漂泊的灵魂留出空间。丽，或者说曾是绫波丽的存在，无法使用南极的卵，因为它早已被摧毁，她也不能使用人类称之为地底都市的卵，否则会毁掉她尘世记忆所在的地上城市。

So instead, the union of Adam and Lilith gathered the Evangelions. The fallen MP Evas, those failed experiments in Terminal Dogma, and the others under construction or abandoned throughout the world. Their constituent molecules melting away into the universe as they became pure energy and moved through the atmosphere to above the Hakone Valley where said energy was transformed back into matter and a new Black Moon was formed. As an ark for the souls of humanity that wished to remain tied together. An ark with two companions, one of red the other purple hue, eternal evidence that Mankind had existed in this universe as it began its journey to cosmos incognita.  
因此，亚当与莉莉丝的结合体召集了所有福音战士。那些堕落的量产 EVA，在最终教条区失败的实验品，以及世界各地正在建造或已被遗弃的其他机体。它们的分子结构在宇宙中消融，化为纯粹的能量穿越大气层，到达箱根山谷上空，这些能量又转化为物质，形成了一个新的黑月。作为希望保持联系的人类灵魂的方舟。方舟上有两位同伴，一红一紫，永恒地证明人类曾在这宇宙中存在，并开始了通往未知宇宙的旅程。

And beneath this new ark, on the shores of Lake Ashi, two pairs of eyes opened as one. Freshly reforged lungs took in their first breaths as the waves broke quietly in the noonday light. Sand crunched between gloved hands as two hearts built the courage to reach out. The warmth of another human present even through layers of advanced polyurethane. Until finally cobalt and cerulean met and doubt vanished from the human soul:  
在这新方舟之下，芦之湖畔，两双眼睛同时睁开。新鲜重铸的肺部吸入第一口空气，正午阳光下，波浪轻轻拍岸。沙粒在戴着手套的指间嘎吱作响，两颗心鼓起勇气伸出双手。即使隔着多层先进聚氨酯，也能感受到另一个人存在的温暖。直到最后，钴蓝与天蓝交汇，人类的疑虑从灵魂中消散：

"How happy I am." “我是多么幸福。”

**NERV Director's Office: Six Months Later  
NERV 总部 总监办公室：六个月后**

A pair of tired eyes gleaned over a seemingly endless mountain of paperwork, which seemed to all require eight seals or signatures for even the most mundane of tasks.  
一双疲惫的眼睛扫过似乎永无止境的文件山，这些文件似乎都需要八次盖章或签字，即便是再琐碎的任务也不例外。

'I should be used to that by now though…' the director absently thought as their hands stamped another form in triplicate and placed it in the "done" pile before their crow's feet eyes looked up at the surrounding walls: 'I need to get a clock installed here.' The stream of consciousness continued as their gaze traversed all the empty, kabbalah-filled, space.  
“我应该已经习惯了才对……”局长心不在焉地想着，手中的印章在三联单上又盖了一下，将其放入“已完成”的文件堆中。随后，他们眼角的皱纹微微一动，抬头望向四周的墙壁：“我得在这里装个钟。”意识流继续着，他们的目光扫过所有空荡荡、充满卡巴拉符号的空间。

Their concentration was broken however as the four-meter-tall doors opened and the provisional Director of Project E walked in.  
然而，他们的专注被打破了，因为四米高的门缓缓打开，项目 E 的临时局长走了进来。

"You wanted to see me?"  
"您找我？"

"Ah yes!" The Director perked up at the new arrival and scrambled through the stacks of documents to find the one she needed. "There it is!" as their hands extricated a manilla envelope with German postage from the second pile to the edge. "Your father returned the emancipation paperwork."  
"啊，是的！"" 看到新来的人，主任精神一振，急忙在成堆的文件中翻找她需要的那一份。""找到了！"" 她从第二堆文件边缘抽出一个贴有德国邮票的马尼拉文件袋。""你父亲把解放文件寄回来了。"

"That's great Misat-, I mean Director Katsuragi." Asuka Langley Sohryu corrected as she rushed forward and leaned on the purple-head's desk to look at the paperwork.  
"太好了，美佐..., 我是说，葛城主任。"" 惣流·明日香·兰格雷赶紧纠正道，她快步上前，靠在紫发主任的桌边查看文件。"

"He signed it but didn't date it, so just hold onto it until your sixteenth birthday and file it then." Misato said as Asuka took the proffered envelope.  
"他签了字但没有写日期，所以先保管好，等到你十六岁生日那天再归档。" 美里说道，同时明日香接过了递来的信封。

"Will the new German consulate in Tokyo-3 be open by then?" Asuka asked as she gave the documents a onceover just to confirm there weren't any mistakes.  
"到那时，东京-3 的新德国领事馆会开放吗？" 明日香一边问，一边快速浏览文件，确认没有错误。

"Let's hope so." Misato said hopefully before changing the subject: "By the way how are things progressing?"  
"希望如此。" 美里满怀希望地说，然后转换了话题："对了，事情进展得怎么样了？"

"I've finally managed to organize and collate the data left behind on the MAGI. So, I should hopefully be able to pick up where she left off. But to be honest I only really have theoretical experience with the research side of things." Asuka confessed as she thought back to her college days and regretted she sprinted through all the classes so quickly.  
"我终于设法整理并汇总了 MAGI 上留下的数据。所以，我应该有望能够接手她未完成的工作。但说实话，我对研究方面的实际经验其实只有理论基础。" 明日香坦白道，她回想起自己的大学时光，后悔当初为了快速完成所有课程而匆忙冲刺。

"Don't sweat it, you ARE the most qualified metaphysical biologist in Japan." Misato said, though left out that that was mostly due to process of elimination, Misato now headed NERV for that same reason as that old sensei Fuyutsuki did not deign to return. "And there's a lot less management since it's not as big of a division as it was before." Which was true as the department's staff, even including Asuka could be counted on one hand with fingers to spare.  
"别担心，你确实是日本最顶尖的形而上学生物学家。" 美里说道，尽管她没有提及这主要是因为排除法的结果，美里现在领导 NERV 也是出于同样的原因，那位老教授冬月并未屈尊回归。"而且，由于部门规模没有以前那么大，管理工作也少了很多。" 确实如此，该部门的员工，即使包括明日香在内，用一只手的手指数都绰绰有余。

"There's no word of Dr. Akagi or Lieutenant Ibuki?" Asuka asked as talk of work reminded her of the fate of her predecessor.  
"没有赤木博士或伊吹中尉的消息吗？" 明日香问道，工作的话题让她想起了前任的命运。

Misato just shook her head in response. In the immediate aftermath of Third Impact around a third of humanity had rejected Instrumentality outright and returned in the first minutes and hours, preventing any catastrophic damage to global infrastructure. Over the next several months a further third of humanity had made their way back from Instrumentality, starting at a torrent of millions per week, but now slowing to a single digit trickle as it appeared the remaining third of humanity chose to remain in the false land of the New Black Moon. Among them the faux-blonde doctor and her protégé whose heart caused her to follow.  
美里只是摇了摇头作为回应。在第三次冲击的直接后果中，大约三分之一的人类完全拒绝了工具化，并在最初的几分钟和几小时内返回，防止了全球基础设施的灾难性破坏。接下来的几个月里，又有三分之一的人类从工具化中回归，起初是每周数百万的洪流，但现在已减缓至个位数的涓涓细流，似乎剩下的三分之一人类选择留在新黑月这个虚假之地。其中包括那位金发假象的医生和她那位因心而追随的门徒。

"That reminds me." Director Katsuragi said as talk of those remaining in Instrumentality jogged her memory: "Give this to Shinji when you go home, he should look at it." She said after rummaging through another pile for a khaki folder.  
“这让我想起来了。”当谈论到那些留在工具化中的人时，葛城美里说道，这勾起了她的记忆：“你回家时把这个交给真嗣，他应该看看。”她在另一堆文件中翻找出一个卡其色的文件夹后说道。

"What is it?" Asuka asked as she added the nondescript file to the growing pile in her arms.  
“这是什么？”明日香问道，同时将这个不起眼的文件夹加入她怀中不断增多的文件堆里。

"It regards Gendo Ikari's estate." Misato said rather solemnly. "They're beginning to classify those who've yet to return as _temporarily_ legally deceased in order to not let matters sit in limbo indefinitely."  
"这是关于碇源堂的遗产。" 美里相当严肃地说道，"他们开始将那些尚未归来的人暂时列为法律上的死亡，以避免事情无限期地悬而未决。"

"And since you're technically Shinji's guardian they passed the paperwork on to you." Asuka surmised as she opened the folder and her calm demeanor vanished: "There's that much in there!?" Asuka said incredulously as she counted the number of zeros.  
"而既然你名义上是真嗣的监护人，他们就把文件转交给你了。" 明日香推测着，同时打开文件夹，她的平静神情瞬间消失："这里面有这么多！？" 明日香难以置信地数着零的个数。

"The UN Accounting Office and Ministry of Finance might have a thing or two to say down the line but the bastard was _really_ good at covering his tracks." Misato said her tone almost betraying an admiration for Gendo Ikari's feats.  
"联合国会计办公室和财政部可能后续会有所表态，但那混蛋在掩盖痕迹方面确实做得滴水不漏。" 美里说道，语气中几乎透露出对碇源堂成就的一丝敬佩。

"So they can't prove embezzlement." Asuka stated rather bluntly as she guessed how a civil servant like Gendo had acquired such a vast fortune.  
"这样一来，他们就无法证明他挪用了公款。" 明日香直截了当地说道，猜测像源堂这样的公务员是如何积累起如此巨额财富的。

"My working theory is it was how he was funding all the side projects for his scenario without SEELE realizing it." Director Katsuragi said as her hands went together and she involuntarily assumed a position similar to Gendo's trademark steepled hands.  
"我的推测是，他通过这种方式为他的计划中的所有旁支项目提供资金，而让 SEELE 毫无察觉。" 葛城美里主任说道，她的双手合十，不自觉地摆出了与源堂标志性的指尖相抵相似的姿势。

"There's almost enough there to build another Eva Unit…" Asuka added as she realized the value of the estate was denominated in dollars and not yen.  
"那里的资产几乎足够再造一台 EVA 机体了……" 明日香补充道，她意识到这些财产的价值是以美元而非日元计价的。

"Let's hope that doesn't happen." Misato said her tone turning grim, but there was room for hope. As without the human soul within the core to generate an AT Field, Evangelions simply were not militarily worth their immense cost. Even an armored company properly trained and equipped could probably suffice for a fraction of the cost. And then there was the unspoken global taboo of the technology necessary following Third Impact and its momentary connection of all minds that had made the truth known to humanity. Confirmed hours later by Kaji's dissemination of the data he and Misato had gathered to the public.  
"希望那不会发生。" 美里语气变得严肃，但仍存有一线希望。因为没有人类灵魂在核心中产生 AT 力场，使 EVA 在军事上不值得其巨大的成本。即使是一支装备精良、训练有素的装甲部队，其成本也仅为 EVA 的一小部分。此外，还有第三次冲击后全球对所需技术的禁忌，以及那一刻所有心灵相连，让人类知晓真相的短暂联系。几小时后，加持和美里收集的数据被公开，证实了这一点。

"Yeah…" Asuka answered simply as talk of Evas reminded her of the mother who couldn't return. "Th-This seems like a lot of paperwork for peacetime." Asuka stuttered a little as she changed the subject. Misato let out a little chuckle before answering:  
"是啊……" 谈到 EVA，明日香不禁想起了无法归来的母亲。"这……这在和平时期似乎有很多文书工作。" 明日香有些结巴地转移了话题。美里轻笑一声，然后回答道：

"Even without Evas or Angels the world still has a use for NERV. They need an impartial and international organization to ensure that no one country gains a monopoly or unfair advantage in the realm of S2 engines, which is now NERV's primary function." Misato paused the monologue she sometimes practiced in front of a mirror to stand up from her over clogged desk and gaze out at the Geofront. "To refine and distribute this new and nearly limitless source of energy to humanity."  
"即便没有 EVA 或使徒，世界仍然需要 NERV。他们需要一个公正且国际化的组织，以确保在 S2 引擎领域，没有任何一个国家能够获得垄断或不公平的优势，这现在是 NERV 的主要职能。" 美里暂停了她有时在镜子前练习的独白，从她那堆满文件的办公桌旁站起身，凝视着地底空洞。"为了提炼并分配这种新近近乎无限的能源给人类。"

"What does my Metaphysical Biology research have to do with that mission?" Asuka asked still all these months later unsure if Misato's appointment of her was simply for visa and immigration purposes.  
"我的形而上学生物学研究与这一使命有何关联？" 几个月过去了，明日香仍然不确定美里任命她是否仅仅出于签证和移民的目的。

"Well, it's still a new field with boundless potential, and NERV already has the equipment and experience with it, so it just makes sense to continue it as well." Director Katsuragi gave the same response she'd given to the UN Oversight Panel sans brandished sidearm.  
"嗯，这仍然是一个充满无限潜力的新领域，而 NERV 已经拥有了相关的设备和经验，所以继续进行这项研究也是顺理成章的。" 葛城总监对联合国监督小组给出了同样的回答，只是少了那把挥舞的手枪。

"Right…" Asuka responded without conviction but glad for Misato's support: "Oh I hear Kaji's official appointment as UN Liaison came down the other day." Asuka said as she remembered the memo that had been distributed on the NERV internal system.  
“好吧……”明日香敷衍地回应，但很高兴有美里支持：“哦，我听说加持的联合国联络官正式任命前几天下来了。”明日香想起在 NERV 内部系统分发的那份备忘录。

"Well, he's got his friends in the Japanese Defense Ministry to thank for that." Misato remarked as she remembered the unofficial celebration at her and Kaji's newly built house in the Geofront and her face reddened.  
“嗯，他得感谢日本防卫省的朋友们帮忙。”美里评论道，想起她和加持在地下城新建房子里举行的非正式庆祝会，脸上不禁泛红。

Just then the phone covered in budgetary reports began ringing, conveniently showing Misato the time.  
就在这时，堆满预算报告的电话响了起来，正好让美里看到了时间。

"I've got to take that but why don't you take an early day and take those documents home, Shinji ought to be done with school by now." Director Katsuragi said before picking up the receiver and holding the cool plastic to her ear, not giving the German redhead time to protest.  
"我得接这个电话，但你为什么不早点下班，把那些文件带回家呢，真嗣现在应该已经放学了。" 葛城美里主任说着，拿起听筒，将冰凉的塑料贴在耳边，没给德国红发少女抗议的机会。

"Thank you, Misato," Asuka mouthed quietly as she made her way out of the office and making it back to the Katsuragi Apartment in record time as she beat the evening rush hour.  
"谢谢你，美里，" 明日香轻声说道，随即匆匆离开办公室，以破纪录的速度赶回葛城公寓，避开了晚高峰。

Well, Katsuragi Apartment was probably not the right name anymore as while it still technically was Misato's apartment, she was rarely by anymore, instead living in the Geofront as she adjusted to being the only high-ranking member of NERV remaining that world leaders had any trust in.  
不过，葛城公寓这个名字或许已经不合适了，尽管从技术上讲它仍是美里的公寓，但她已经很少回来，而是住在地底都市，适应着作为 NERV 仅存的高级成员，世界各国领导人唯一信任的角色。

'She'd probably sell it to us after the emancipation paperwork goes through.' Asuka thought as the elevator doors opened and she did what every woman does and think about how best to spend her other half's money.  
“等解放文件一办妥，她大概就会卖给我们。”明日香想着，电梯门一开，她便像所有女人一样，开始思考如何最好地花掉另一半的钱。

"I'm home." Asuka said as the front door hissed open and flavorful aromas washed over her nostrils.  
“我回来了。”明日香说着，前门嘶的一声打开，诱人的香气扑鼻而来。

"Welcome home Asuka!" Shinji called out from the kitchen as Asuka left her shoes messily by the door and made her way inside.  
“欢迎回家，明日香！”真嗣从厨房喊道，明日香在门口随意踢掉鞋子，走进屋内。

"Smells good." The German redhead complimented as her arms wrapped around Shinji's waist, crumpling the fabric of the burgundy apron Shinji was wearing as he chopped some cabbage thinly.  
"闻起来真香。"德国红发女孩称赞道，她的手臂环抱住真嗣的腰，弄皱了他穿着的深红色围裙，当时他正在将一些卷心菜切成薄片。

"It's just tonkatsu over rice with some slaw." Shinji said nonchalantly as he paused what he was doing and gave Asuka a welcome kiss.  
"只是猪排盖饭配上一些凉拌卷心菜而已。"真嗣漫不经心地说道，他停下手中的活，给了明日香一个欢迎的吻。

"I'm guessing Misato told you she let me off early." Asuka whispered into Shinji's ear before giving it a little nibble as she correctly guessed why Shinji had started making dinner so early:  
"我猜是美里告诉你她让我提前下班了。"明日香在真嗣耳边低语，然后轻轻咬了一下他的耳垂，她猜对了为什么真嗣这么早就准备晚餐的原因。

"Right as ever Asuka." "一如既往地正确，明日香。"

"It's so nice out why don't we eat on the balcony." The redhead changed the subject as she released the brown-haired boy from her grip and removed her NERV uniformed jacket as she made her way to their shared bedroom to change.  
"天气这么好，我们为什么不在阳台上吃呢？" 红发女孩转移了话题，她松开了对棕发少年的束缚，脱下 NERV 制服外套，走向他们共同的卧室去换衣服。

In around another twenty minutes Asuka was leaning back in their new patio chairs, toothpick in hand as she patted her satiated belly.  
大约又过了二十分钟，明日香靠在他们新买的露台椅上，手里拿着牙签，轻拍着吃饱的肚子。

"That was good _**liebling.**_" Asuka said as Shinji began to gather the dirty dishes together.  
"那是个不错的谎言，亲爱的。" 明日香说道，同时真嗣开始收拾脏盘子。

"_**Keine Ursache**_." Shinji responded in German before Asuka yet again surprised him and left her comfortable position and took the small tower of plates and glasses from Shinji's hands.  
"不客气。" 真嗣用德语回应，随后明日香再次让他感到意外，她离开了舒适的姿势，从真嗣手中接过那一小摞盘子和杯子。

"I'll take care of these." Asuka began before planting a peck on Shinji's lips. "Enjoy the sun." She continued as her chin pointed to the set of lawn chairs on the other end of their balcony.  
"我来处理这些。" 明日香开始说道，随即在真嗣的唇上轻轻一吻。"享受阳光吧。" 她继续说着，下巴指向阳台另一端的躺椅。

"Thanks Asuka." Shinji said simply as he knew better than to argue with his feisty lover, who made her way back inside the apartment. Shinji meanwhile laid upon the long lawn chairs; his skin warm as the sunlight washed upon him. His body enjoying the bright days of peace that had been hard won as his mind succumbed to drowsiness.  
"谢谢你，明日香。" 真嗣简单地回答，他深知与这位脾气火爆的爱人争论毫无意义，她已经回到了公寓里。与此同时，真嗣躺在长长的躺椅上，阳光洒在他身上，皮肤感到温暖。他的身体享受着这来之不易的和平日子，而他的思绪则渐渐陷入困倦。

Asuka meanwhile hummed an old symphony as her hands were covered in warm suds when she heard a 'Waark!' sound behind her:  
与此同时，明日香哼着一首古老的交响曲，双手沾满了温暖的泡沫，这时她听到身后传来一声'哇克！'的叫声：

"Seriously Pen Pen Misato needs to remember to take you to her new place." Asuka sighed as she rinsed off the soap and pulled some sardines out of the fridge.  
"说真的，Pen Pen，美里需要记得带你去她的新地方。" 明日香叹了口气，冲洗掉肥皂泡，从冰箱里拿出一些沙丁鱼。

"Wark?!" Pen Pen let out again, the question clear.  
"哇克？！" 佩佩再次发出声音，疑问清晰可见。

"There's no beer!" The German redhead said as she placed the small fishes in front of him.  
"没有啤酒！" 德国红发女子说着，将小鱼放在他面前。

"Wark…" The warm water penguin let out sadly as its mind debated whether life without alcohol or Misato's cooking was more preferrable while Asuka finished the dishes and walked out onto the balcony to check on her baka:  
"哇克…" 温水企鹅悲伤地发出声音，心中纠结着没有酒精的生活和美里烹饪的食物哪个更可取，而明日香则洗完碗碟，走出阳台查看她的笨蛋：

"Shinji…Shinji…" Cobalt eyes opened to a soft voice and even softer hand shaking his shoulder, "You dozed off." His ears heard as his eyes met Asuka's cerulean orbs and a smile formed on his lips.  
“真嗣…真嗣…” 钴蓝色的眼睛在温柔的声音和更温柔的摇晃肩膀中睁开，“你打瞌睡了。”他的耳朵听到，眼睛与明日香的天蓝色眼眸相遇，嘴角随之绽放出微笑。

"Sorry." He gave his habitual answer as he took the proffered ginger ale with a sprig of mint from his lover's hands as she set her own down on the nearby table so she could hold the folds of her yellow sundress as she sat down next to her Shinji who'd yet to change out of his school uniform.  
“对不起。”他习惯性地回答，接过恋人递来的姜汁汽水，上面插着一枝薄荷。明日香将自己的饮料放在旁边的桌上，坐下时双手提着黄色太阳裙的褶皱，坐在还未换下校服的真嗣旁边。

Their hands found each other, thumbs making circles on the back of the hand or the other's palm as they enjoyed their drinks as the sun began to kiss the tips of the mountains that surrounded Tokyo-3.  
他们的手找到了彼此，拇指在对方手背或掌心画着圈，享受着饮料，夕阳开始亲吻环绕着第三新东京市的山峰之巅。

"Oh, remember we need to go shopping for a gift for Mrs. Horaki's baby shower." The pink coloring of the sky at sunset reminding Shinji of the upcoming event.  
“哦，记得我们要去给洞木老师的宝宝派对买礼物。”夕阳时分天边泛起的粉红色让真嗣想起了即将到来的活动。

"I still can't believe Hikari is going to have another sister." Asuka said in disbelief before continuing, "I guess three wasn't enough for them." Though immediately afterwards realized the words were unfair to people reunited after thinking the other lost forever. 'Yeah, I'd probably be _overeager_ too' Asuka thought with a little giggle as the last whisps of the sun fell behind the horizon and the sky began to darken in earnest.  
“我还是不敢相信光会再有一个妹妹。”明日香难以置信地说道，接着又说，“我猜对他们来说三个还不够。”但随即意识到这些话对那些以为永远失去对方后又重逢的人来说不公平。“是啊，我大概也会过于急切吧。”明日香想着，轻轻笑了一声，随着最后一缕阳光消失在地平线后，天空开始真正暗了下来。

The light pollution of Tokyo-3 was still enough to drown out all but the brightest of stars in the sky, though the ambience of a million apartments and neon lighting made up for the lack of starlight.  
第三新东京市的光污染依然足以遮蔽天空中除最亮星星外的所有星光，尽管百万公寓和霓虹灯的氛围弥补了星光的缺失。

As the night descended an establishment across the street from their apartment opened its doors, a small karaoke bar, that had much more business now that the city was not constantly on the brink of becoming a battlefield at any given moment.  
随着夜幕降临，他们公寓对面的一家小卡拉 OK 酒吧开门营业了，如今城市不再时刻处于战火边缘，这家酒吧的生意比以往兴隆了许多。

As was their custom when they opened for business the karaoke bar played an old song, written by a long since passed American. Shinji didn't understand any of the lyrics but could tell with its slow rhythm and lyrics what it was meant for.  
按照惯例，卡拉 OK 酒吧开业时播放了一首老歌，由一位早已离世的美国人创作。真嗣虽然听不懂歌词，但通过其缓慢的节奏和歌词内容，他能感受到这首歌的意境。

"Let's dance Asuka." Shinji said as he pulled her up from her chair by their still joined hands.  
“我们跳舞吧，明日香。”真嗣说着，拉着他们依然紧握的手，将她从椅子上拉了起来。

"If you think you can handle me." Asuka said with a laugh as she rose to her lover's challenge.  
“如果你觉得你能应付我。”明日香笑着回应了爱人的挑战，站起身来。

Neither were very skilled dancers, nor knew much technique, but they managed to not step on each other's toes as they circled together on their cozy balcony in the cool night under the light of the full moon. Asuka rested her head against Shinji's shoulder, and both pressed their bodies together, Shinji's right arm around her waist while Asuka's left hand wrapped around Shinji's back. All the while their other hands clasped together tightly at shoulder level.  
两人都不是很擅长跳舞，也没有太多技巧，但他们设法在凉爽的夜晚，在满月的照耀下，于他们温馨的阳台上绕圈时没有踩到对方的脚。明日香将头靠在真嗣的肩膀上，两人紧紧相拥，真嗣的右臂环绕在她的腰间，而明日香的左手则环抱在真嗣的背上。与此同时，他们的另一只手在肩部高度紧紧相握。

Asuka pulled her head away from Shinji's shoulder and cobalt orbs met cerulean blues for a moment and their lips met as the song neared its climax.  
明日香从真嗣的肩膀上抬起头，钴蓝色的眼眸与天蓝色的目光交汇片刻，随着歌曲接近高潮，他们的唇瓣相触。

"_**In other words…"**_ The song lyrics sounded as the lovers unknowingly yet truly finished the line…  
"换句话说…" 歌曲的歌词响起，恋人们不知不觉却准确地完成了这句台词…

"_**I love you"**_ "我爱你"

**A/N:** So here it is, the last full chapter of A Shower Guest. There is likely going to be a short Non-Lemon Epilogue coming soon, but the story could end here. This one is shorter, but I decided to split the events of End of Evangelion into 2 parts just so that the last chapter that tied everything together didn't end up being 20k words, I had thought about the last chapter ending when Asuka was hit with the lance but decided that would be too much of a cliffhanger so I decided to split it up by Instrumentality, which now rewatching End of Evangelion the length of each part matches up nicely as about 2/3 of the film is the buildup and only about 1/3 is actual Instrumentality. There were also 3 scrapped stories of people across the world just meant to show how Instrumentality, in my mind in this story, worked but they were cut just to keep the focus on Asuka and Shinji.  
A/N: 这就是了，《淋浴访客》的最后一篇完整chapter。可能很快会有一个简短的非柠檬尾声，但故事也可以在这里结束。这一篇较短，但我决定将《新世纪福音战士剧场版：Air/真心为你》中的事件分成两部分，这样最后一篇将所有内容串联起来的chapter就不会变成 2 万字了。我曾考虑过在明日香被长矛击中时结束最后一篇chapter，但觉得那样太悬念重重，所以我决定按人类补完计划来分隔，现在重看《新世纪福音战士剧场版：Air/真心为你》，每一部分的长度都恰到好处，大约 2/3 是铺垫，只有 1/3 是真正的人类补完。还有三篇被废弃的故事，原本是为了展示在我心目中，这个故事里人类补完计划是如何运作的，但为了保持对明日香和真嗣的关注，这些故事被删除了。

I really hope I've done justice to the ending and that it lives up to the expectations all the faithful readers have had. Your support has honestly surprised me with just how many of you have read this and encouraged me to see it through to the end. What started out as an experimental one-shot has now become what every Eva fan-fic writer wants, a retelling with a happy ending.  
我真心希望自己能圆满完成这个结局，不负所有忠实读者的期待。你们的支持实在令我惊讶，有这么多人阅读并鼓励我坚持到底。原本只是一次实验性的一发完结，如今却成了每位 EVA 同人作者梦寐以求的——一个带有幸福结局的重述。

As always let me know what you think.  
一如既往，欢迎大家留下你们的想法。

### ASG Epilogue

"God's in His Heaven. All's right with the World."  
"上帝在他的天堂。世上一切安好。"

---
'She'll be so happy.' The brown-haired man, barely on the right side of thirty, thought as he pressed down the call contact button on his phone's touchscreen. 'Technology sure has come a long way…' he thought absently as his ear heard the first of several rings. Truly it is amazing how far technology can advance with Mankind not ploughing all its resources into Evangelions and shadowy cabals.  
“她一定会很高兴的。”这位棕发男子，刚过而立之年不久，一边想着一边按下了手机触摸屏上的呼叫联系人按钮。“科技确实进步了不少……”他心不在焉地想着，耳边响起了第一声铃响。人类没有将所有资源投入到福音战士和神秘组织中，科技的进步真是令人惊叹。

"Shinji? What is it?" Asuka Langley Ikari asked her husband.  
“真嗣？怎么了？”明日香·兰格雷·碇问她的丈夫。

"Asuka, I just got the schedule, and as part of the Orchestral Exchange we're spending two weeks in Germany." The Cellist of the Tokyo-3 Philharmonic told his wife.  
“明日香，我刚拿到日程表，作为乐团交流计划的一部分，我们要去德国待两周。”东京-3 爱乐乐团的提琴手告诉他的妻子。

Shinji had debated long and hard over what path to take in his life and had narrowed it down to either a culinary or musical career. Not that he really needed the money, more just something to do. In the end he had decided not to turn something he loved into a vocation, lest it lose its luster and the joy leave his heart.  
真嗣在人生的道路上长时间深思熟虑，最终将选择缩小到烹饪或音乐事业之间。并非他真的需要赚钱，更多是找点事情做。最终，他决定不将自己热爱的事物变成职业，以免它失去光彩，心中的喜悦也随之消逝。

"_**Wunderbar!**_" His German redhead of a wife exclaimed: "Izumi has always wanted to see where mama's from. She'll be so excited!"  
“太棒了！”他的德国红发妻子欢呼道，“泉美一直想看看妈妈来自哪里。她一定会非常兴奋的！”

"She's already seen it, she just doesn't remember it." Shinji said with a chuckle, his mind reminiscing on the trip almost five years ago to introduce the newborn Izumi to her grandfather, as he opened his car door, a purple four door hatchback, and put the preliminary schedule on the passenger seat. His eye catching a glance of the morning's newspaper, it's accompanying photo credited the name Kensuke Aida.  
“她已经看过了，只是不记得了。”真嗣笑着说，脑海中回想起大约五年前带刚出生的泉美去见她祖父的那次旅行，他打开车门，一辆紫色的四门掀背车，将初步行程表放在副驾驶座上。目光不经意间瞥到早晨的报纸，附带的照片上署名是健介相田。

'I hope he's okay.' Shinji's mind involuntarily spoke as it recalled his bespeckled friend.  
“希望他没事。” 真嗣的脑海中不由自主地浮现出那位戴着眼镜的朋友。

An unofficial global ceasefire had followed Third Impact, as the momentary connection of consciousness had allowed humanity to literally live in one another's shoes. Truly if man knew the pain his words and actions caused in the hearts of others the world would be a kinder place. But as the memory of that understanding faded and a new generation began to come of age, old hotspots flared up again in renewed bloodshed. Only time would tell if the lesson of Instrumentality would long endure, or vanish with the generations that experienced it. In this space the military otaku had become an internationally acclaimed conflict journalist.  
第三次冲击后，全球非正式停火随之而来，那一刻意识的短暂连接让人类实实在在地体会到了彼此的生活。如果人们真正了解自己的言行在他人心中造成的痛苦，世界将会更加美好。但随着那份理解的记忆逐渐淡去，新一代开始成年，旧日的冲突热点再次燃起血腥的战火。只有时间能证明，神识融合的教训是否会持久，还是随着经历它的那一代人而消逝。在这个时代，那位军事宅男已成为享誉国际的冲突记者。

"I'll call them this weekend and let them know we're coming" Asuka said, bringing Shinji back to reality.  
“这周末我会给他们打电话，告诉他们我们要来。” 明日香说道，将真嗣拉回了现实。

"Are you sure you can get the time off?" Shinji asked, his tone uncertain, as he buckled his seatbelt.  
"你确定能请到假吗？" 真嗣问道，语气中带着不确定，一边系上安全带。

"I didn't use up all my leave when Otto was born." Asuka said as Shinji glanced in the rearview mirror to the two child seats in the back. "Besides I doubt Misato would raise much of a fuss about it."  
"奥托出生时我还没用完所有假期。" 明日香说道，真嗣通过后视镜瞥了一眼后座上的两个儿童座椅。"再说了，我怀疑美里不会对此大惊小怪。"

"True." Shinji said with a chuckle as he turned his key in the ignition and the engine spurred to life.  
"确实。" 真嗣笑着说，他转动钥匙，引擎随之启动。

"Did you just finish for the day?" Asuka asked as the speaker picked up the engine starting.  
"你刚结束今天的工作吗？" 明日香问道，与此同时，引擎启动的声音响起。

"Yeah, we just finished recording for the contract with the studio." Shinji answered.  
"嗯，我们刚完成了与录音室的合同录制。" 真嗣回答道。

"Was it for a game or movie this time?" Asuka asked with a smile on her face as she thought of her guilty pleasure of seeing her baka's name in the credits.  
"这次是为游戏还是电影配音？" 明日香微笑着问道，心中暗自享受着在片尾字幕中看到她那笨蛋名字的乐趣。

"I honestly don't remember, we've been so busy it almost blurs into one." Shinji said with an exasperated voice as he thought back to the last month's packed schedule as the editors furiously hurried to put the finishing touches on the summer's releases.  
"我真的不记得了，我们太忙了，几乎都混成一团了。" 真嗣带着无奈的语气说道，回想起上个月紧凑的日程，编辑们急匆匆地为夏季的出版物做最后的润色。

"I've still got some work to do…" The redhead said sullenly as her gaze swept over the mounds of papers on her desk.  
"我还有一些工作要做……" 红发女孩沮丧地说道，目光扫过桌上堆积如山的文件。

While Metaphysical Biology had since the days before Second Impact proved that the soul was indeed a reality, applications of that knowledge were still slow in coming, mainly due to the host of ethical concerns that came from manipulating something so intrinsic to humanity. So Asuka's research was primarily focused on AT fields and the collective subconscious, but even that was fraught with controversy amid fears about potential military or social control applications.  
尽管在第二次冲击之前，形而上学生物学就已经证明了灵魂确实存在，但这些知识的应用进展缓慢，主要是因为操纵如此根植于人性的东西会带来一系列伦理问题。因此，明日香的研究主要集中在 AT 力场和集体潜意识上，但即便如此，在担心潜在的军事或社会控制应用的担忧中，她的研究也充满了争议。

As a result a great deal of Asuka's job as 'Head of Metaphysical Research' was ironically submitting paperwork to various scientific and governmental ethics agencies about why what she was doing was not related to human sacrifice.  
因此，作为'超自然研究部门负责人'的明日香，其工作的一大讽刺之处在于，她需要向各种科学和政府伦理机构提交文件，解释她所从事的研究与人类献祭无关。

"So can you pick up Otto on your way home?" Asuka began again after becoming lost in thought: "I'll get Izumi from the kindergarten when I finish." She said referencing the onsite NERV kindergarten that originated about 18 months following Third Impact when Director Katsuragi discovered she was pregnant with the first of three children.  
“那么，你回家路上能顺便接一下奥托吗？”明日香在陷入沉思后重新开口：“我下班后会去幼儿园接泉。”她提到的是 NERV 附属幼儿园，该园成立于第三次冲击后的约 18 个月，当时葛城博士发现自己怀上了三个孩子中的第一个。

"_There should be a place for m-, I mean NERV employees to put their children."_  
“应该有个地方让，我是说，NERV 员工安置他们的孩子。”

This kindergarten also had a nursery for newborns, but Otto wasn't there, instead he was in the care of Hikari Suzuhara.  
这所幼儿园还设有新生儿护理室，但奥托并不在那里，而是由铃原光照顾。

"I still can't believe I had two children in the time it took her to get pregnant once." Asuka said with a laugh as she shook her head at the thought of her freckled friend.  
“我还是不敢相信，她在怀孕一次的时间里，我竟然生了两个孩子。”明日香笑着摇头，想起她那满脸雀斑的朋友。

'It wasn't for lack of trying.' Shinji thought as he remembered the drunken conversations, with some twinge of guilt, at the "Guy's Nights" he and Toji, and sometimes Kensuke when he was actually in Japan, had at a bar that served a decent drink.  
“并非他们没有努力。”真嗣想着，回忆起那些醉醺醺的夜晚，他和东治，有时还有实际上在日本的健介，在一家提供不错酒水的酒吧里的“哥们之夜”，心中略感愧疚。

But once Hikari had found herself pregnant a wholly unnecessary dread came over her and she begged Asuka to teach her the ways of motherhood and allow her to practice with their two-month old Otto.  
但当光发现自己怀孕后，一种完全不必要的恐惧笼罩了她，她恳求明日香教她母亲的方式，并允许她与他们两个月大的奥托练习。

"I'll get him." Shinji said simply.  
"我去抱他。" 真嗣简单地说道。

"Thanks, I love you." Wife said to husband.  
"谢谢，我爱你。" 妻子对丈夫说。

"I love you too." Husband said to wife.  
“我也爱你。”丈夫对妻子说道。

Asuka put the phone back on the receiver after the call ended. Her eyes focusing back on the slate black file, alone amongst a sea of manilla. The project that now consumed the bulk of her attention and had for the last three years, the reason she had returned to work just four days after giving birth to Otto.  
通话结束后，明日香将电话放回听筒。她的目光重新聚焦在那片牛皮纸海洋中唯一的漆黑文件上。这个项目如今占据了她的绝大部分注意力，已经持续了三年，也是她产后仅四天就重返工作的原因。

Her lithe fingers grasped the file in her hands as she stood up and walked to her office's three meter long window overlooking the Geofront, the surface of the lake sparkling in the afternoon sun.  
她纤细的手指紧握着文件，站起身来，走向办公室那扇长达三米的窗户，俯瞰着地表下的城市，湖面在午后阳光的照耀下波光粼粼。

"Maybe when Otto is Izumi's age he'll be able to meet his other grandpa." Asuka said as her eyes lowered and looked at the roman lettering on the dark file spelling out: **"Project: GEIST"**  
“也许等奥托到了和泉的年纪，他就能见到他的另一位祖父了。”明日香说道，她的目光低垂，凝视着那份漆黑文件上的罗马字母，上面写着：“计划：GEIST”

After another hour and a half of poring over documents a voice crackled through her office phone's speaker:  
又过了一个半小时，她埋首于文件之中，办公室电话的扬声器突然传来一阵声音：

"Mrs. Ikari, the kindergarten will be closing in thirty minutes." Asuka's assistant reminded her.  
“碇女士，幼儿园将在三十分钟后关闭。”明日香的助手提醒她。

"Right." The German redhead began as she closed the file and locked it in her desk's bottom right drawer: "Thank you Ms. Urakaze."  
"好的。" 这位德国红发女子说着，合上文件并将其锁入办公桌右下角的抽屉："谢谢您，浦风小姐。"

'There'll be plenty of time.' Asuka Langley Ikari thought as gave one last glance to her office before turning out the lights and heading out. The elevator carrying her quickly to the base of the NERV pyramid where her feet took her the rest of the way into the afternoon sunshine and around the pointed corner to where the kindergarten's playground was. The last half dozen of the children yet to be picked up playing and laughing as they enjoyed a carefree childhood.  
'还有很多时间。' 惣流·明日香·兰格雷心想，她最后看了一眼办公室，然后关掉灯，走了出去。电梯迅速将她带到 NERV 金字塔的底部，她的脚步引领她走向午后的阳光，绕过尖角，来到了幼儿园的游乐场。还有六七个孩子尚未被接走，他们正欢笑着，享受着无忧无虑的童年时光。

A girl with brown hair and cerulean eyes was just going down the slide as Asuka approached the waist high yellow fence around the playground.  
明日香走近游乐场周围齐腰高的黄色围栏时，一个棕色头发、天蓝色眼睛的女孩正好从滑梯上滑下来。

"Mama!" Izumi Ikari called out as she ran from the slide and into Asuka's waiting arms. The German redhead lifted her small body up and planted a kiss on her ruddy cheeks before she asked:  
"妈妈！" 碇泉美一边从滑梯上跑下来，一边喊着，扑进了等待着的明日香怀里。这位德国红发女子将她娇小的身体抱起，在她红润的脸颊上亲了一口，然后问道：

"Ready to go home?" "准备好回家了吗？"

Izumi nodded before she turned her face back to the playground and yelled out a farewell:  
泉美点点头，然后转过头对着游乐场大声告别：

"Bye everyone!" The five year old yelled with all the capacity her youthful lungs had while her right arm waved with the enthusiasm that fills childhood. A chorus of 'bye byes' followed mother and daughter as they made their way to the parking lot and from there onto the Ikari Household.  
“再见大家！”五岁的小女孩用她稚嫩的肺部所能发出的最大音量喊道，右臂则带着孩童特有的热情挥舞着。母女俩走向停车场时，身后响起了一片“再见”的回声，随后她们便回到了碇家。

Once they exited the vehicle lift from the Geofront it was a short drive for Asuka's red Mercedes to where She and Shinji had called home for six years. Hurriedly built on a plot of undeveloped land they had bought once Asuka found out she was pregnant the first time. It was the quintessential dream home; high ceilings, plenty of bedrooms and bathrooms and an expansive garden.  
从地底都市的升降机出来后，对于明日香那辆红色的梅赛德斯来说，驶向她和真嗣六年来称之为家的地方只是一段短暂的行程。这片未开发的土地是他们第一次得知明日香怀孕时购买的，房屋也急匆匆地建了起来。这栋房子堪称梦想中的家园；高高的天花板，充足的卧室和浴室，还有一个宽阔的花园。

As Asuka pulled in to the driveway she noticed that Shinji was in said garden, under the one thing they hadn't changed about the property when they built the house, a five meter cherry tree with broad branches that was in full blossom with the coming of spring.  
当明日香驶入车道时，她注意到真嗣正在花园里，就在他们建房时唯一没有改动的那棵树下——一棵五米高的樱花树，枝繁叶茂，随着春天的到来，满树繁花盛开。

As she opened her car door her nostrils told her why, as the aroma of grilled meat washed over her.  
当她打开车门时，她的鼻子告诉了她原因，烤肉的香气扑面而来。

Izumi, once she had been taken out of her car seat, ran over to her father and tugging on his apron asked excitedly:  
泉，一旦从儿童座椅上被抱下来，就跑向她的父亲，拉着他的围裙兴奋地问：

"Are we having kebabs papa?!"  
“爸爸，我们是要吃烤肉串吗？！”

"Yes we are." Shinji said with a smile as he attempted to multitask the grill, his daughter and gently rocking his son in an outdoor cradle behind him and under the shade of the cherry tree.  
"是的，我们来了。" 真嗣微笑着说，他试图同时操作烤架、照顾女儿，并轻轻摇晃着身后樱桃树荫下的户外摇篮中的儿子。

Alas it was to no avail, as the new arrivals woke the previously napping Otto Ikari who began to cry.  
可惜这番努力徒劳无功，因为新来的客人吵醒了原本在打盹的奥托·碇，他开始哭泣。

"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to…" Izumi Ikari began as she sullenly looked to the ground and channeled her father.  
"对不起，我不是故意的……" 泉·碇低着头，沮丧地看着地面，模仿着她的父亲。

"It's alright _**Vögelchen**_" Asuka said as she kneeled down and wrapped her arms around her firstborn. "Babies do that." Her tone soft and nurturing as it channeled the unconditional love of motherhood as she planted a kiss in her brown hair before standing back up and picking up Otto from his cradle. Their matching hair shining bright in the afternoon sun as she soothed her son, his tiny fingers crumpling the fabric of her NERV uniform as he grasped at her bosom.  
"没事的，小鸟儿。" 明日香说着，跪下来用双臂环抱住她的第一个孩子。"小宝宝都会这样。" 她的语气柔和而充满关怀，传递着母爱的无条件温暖，她在女儿的棕色头发上轻轻一吻，然后站起身来，从摇篮里抱起奥托。母子俩的头发在午后阳光下闪耀着光芒，她安抚着儿子，他那细小的手指抓皱了她 NERV 制服的布料，紧紧抓住她的胸前。

"This is almost ready Izumi" Shinji said as he entered back into the conversation, "Can you help me set the table."  
"这就快好了，泉" 真嗣说着重新加入对话，"你能帮我摆一下桌子吗？"

"Right!" A now eager Izumi answered as she began to set out the plates and utensils Shinji had previously brought from the house and set on the nearby white painted wrought iron table, similar to what one might find in a Parisian Café.  
"好的！" 此刻充满热情的泉回答道，她开始摆放真嗣之前从屋里带来的盘子和餐具，放在附近一张白色漆面的锻铁桌上，这种桌子让人联想到巴黎咖啡馆里的那种。

As Izumi busied herself Asuka stood next to her husband who wordlessly and knowingly turned his head to the side and they exchanged a 'welcome home' kiss. Passion still coursing through their bodies as the physical connection was rejoined for even a moment. Asuka even used a bit of her tongue before remembering they were in broad daylight.  
当泉美忙于家务时，明日香站在她丈夫旁边，他默默地、心领神会地转过头，两人交换了一个‘欢迎回家’的吻。激情仍在体内涌动，即便只是片刻，身体上的联系也得以重续。明日香甚至在记起他们身处光天化日之下之前，还用了一点舌头。

"You didn't brush your teeth." Asuka teased with a smile as she rocked Otto in her arms.  
“你没刷牙。”明日香微笑着打趣道，同时轻轻摇晃着怀里的奥托。

"We're about to eat." Shinji retorted, his face wearing a grin, as his hands gestured to the smoking barbecue in front of him.  
“我们正要吃饭呢。”真嗣反驳道，脸上挂着笑容，手势指向面前冒烟的烧烤架。

"It's ready!" An excited Izumi called out and the parents were left wondering if they had been kissing that long or their daughter had inherited both German and Japanese efficiency in one package.  
"准备好了！" 兴奋的和美喊道，让父母不禁疑惑，是他们亲吻了那么久，还是女儿继承了德日双重的效率于一身。

"Shall we?" Shinji said as he loaded a platter with the now ready kebabs and Asuka's answer spoke for the both of them and for so much more:  
"我们开始吧？" 真嗣说着将装满已烤好的烤串的盘子端上，明日香的回应代表了他们两人，也代表了更多：

"I wouldn't have it any other way."  
"我别无所求。"

**Final A/N:** So here is the epilogue to A Shower Guest. It's nice and short and exists mainly to show what became of the characters and the world as time passed. I followed standard Evangelion naming conventions (characters being named after naval vessels) when it came to the Ikari children. With Izumi being named for the modern JMSDF carrier (yes I know it is technically Izumobut Izumi sounds so much better) and Otto being named after the battleship Otto von Bismarck.  
最终章 A/N：这里是《沐浴之客》的尾声。它简洁明了，主要展示了随着时间的流逝，角色们和世界的变迁。在为碇家的孩子们命名时，我遵循了《新世纪福音战士》的命名惯例（角色以海军舰艇命名）。其中，泉美（Izumi）取名自现代日本海上自卫队的航母（是的，我知道技术上应为 Izumo，但泉美听起来好多了），而奥托（Otto）则以战列舰奥托·冯·俾斯麦命名。

Writing this started out just as an experiment to see if I could write convincing dialogue, action scenes, and so on, but I have been truly humbled by all the support it has received, so thank you dear reader.  
起初，写这个只是为了试验自己能否写出令人信服的对话和动作场景等，但我真心被所有支持所感动，所以，亲爱的读者，谢谢你。

The point of this story, the main themes I was trying to get across can be found in the conversations in the last chapter, in instrumentality, since if Anno can hit us over the head with messaging in EoE, I figured I could as well. But basically it's about how to have a healthy relationship as I've seen way way way too much of men and women hating each other and blaming all their problems on the other and being cynical. Hence why this story is a lemon as any exploration of human relationships without talking about sex are wholly unhelpful, it probably didn't need to be so brazen but I also needed to give a reason for people to read it.  
这个故事的核心主题，我想传达的主要信息，可以在最后一章的对话中找到，尤其是在‘工具化’部分，因为既然庵野秀明能在《EoE》中直接给我们灌输思想，我想我也可以。但基本上，这是关于如何建立健康关系的探讨，因为我见过太多男女互相憎恨，将所有问题归咎于对方，变得愤世嫉俗。因此，这个故事包含了一些成人内容，因为任何不涉及性的关系探索都是不完整的，虽然可能不需要如此直白，但我也需要给读者一个阅读的理由。

I can't believe this story is over after so much time and effort. I feel like the dog that caught the car thinking 'what now?' I've done what every NGE fanfic writer dreams of and rewritten the show(well half of it) and given the characters a happy ending.  
我无法相信在投入了这么多时间和精力后，这个故事就这样结束了。我感觉自己像那只抓到汽车的狗，想着‘现在怎么办？’我实现了每个《新世纪福音战士》同人作者的梦想，重写了这部剧（至少一半），并给了角色们一个幸福的结局。

I have an idea for a one-shot not related to ASG, and beyond that my mind is mulling over a Post Third Impact story based around the dichotomy between Asuka's last action, comforting Shinji, and her last words "how disgusting" that would explore the duality of both Shinji and Asuka.  
我有一个与 ASG 无关的一发完结的想法，除此之外，我的脑海中还在酝酿一个《第三次冲击》后的故事，围绕着明日香最后的举动——安慰真嗣，以及她最后的话‘真恶心’，这将探讨真嗣和明日香的双重性。
