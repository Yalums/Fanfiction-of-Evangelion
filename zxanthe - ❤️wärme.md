He tries to fall asleep, but he can't. It's too cold. The wind is too loud. It strikes him, then, how alone the two of them are. They might as well be the last people on Earth. Who knows how long they'll be trapped inside this shelter, so small and low that neither of them can stand up straight? Or: Shinji and Asuka defeat an angel and get caught in a blizzard.  
他努力想入睡，却无法入眠。天气太冷，风声又太吵。他突然意识到他们俩是多么孤独，仿佛地球上只剩下他们两人。谁知道他们还要在这狭小低矮的避难所里被困多久，以至于两人都无法挺直腰板？另一种情况是：真嗣和明日香战胜了一个使徒，结果却被暴风雪困住了。

---
Shinji surfaces gently, a cork bobbing to the surface of a vast tranquil sea. He doesn't sit up right away, instead opting to lie still and gaze at the ceiling. It's nearly lost to murky darkness, illuminated only by a faint greenish glow. A metal lattice stretches across the half of it nearest to the wall, fading into the dimness. The noise of engines surrounds him. He feels a deep rumbling through the seat pressing against his back, shaking his bones. This scene has become familiar. It takes him a moment to remember where he is. On an aerial Eva transport, somewhere over the vast Pacific.  
真嗣缓缓浮出水面，如同一只软木塞在广阔宁静的海面上轻轻漂浮。他没有立刻坐起身，而是选择静静躺着，凝视着天花板。天花板几乎被朦胧的黑暗所吞噬，仅有一丝微弱的绿光点缀其间。靠近墙壁的一半天花板被金属格栅覆盖，逐渐隐没于昏暗之中。发动机的轰鸣声环绕着他，座椅紧贴着他的背部，传来深沉的震动，仿佛撼动着他的骨骼。这一幕对他来说已不再陌生。他需要片刻时间来确认自己的位置——在一架空中 Eva 运输机上，正飞越浩瀚的太平洋。

In the cockpit, a radio chatters away. He catches snatches of Japanese here and there, mixed in with what might be English and what might be German and other words he can't put a name to. _"Cleared for landing,"_ he makes out, and the transport shudders imperceptibly as it begins to tilt to the left.  
驾驶舱内，无线电通讯不断。他偶尔听到几句日语，夹杂着可能是英语或德语的词汇，还有一些他无法识别的语句。“获准降落。”他辨认出这句话，运输机开始向左倾斜，几乎察觉不到的轻微颤动。

_Landing?_ Shinji thinks, and sits up. Out the window is a vast black sea, and in the center of it, almost right below him, is a collection of lights, twinkling in the dark. There aren't very many of them, and they seem to be huddled together, as if for protection. He frowns. His ears begin to pop.  
着陆了吗？真嗣坐起身来，思索着。窗外是一片无垠的黑色海洋，中央处，几乎就在他脚下，有一簇灯光在黑暗中闪烁。这些灯光并不多，它们紧靠在一起，仿佛在寻求保护。真嗣皱起眉头，耳朵开始感到一阵压迫感。

Shinji's not sure he'll ever get used to flying. Before becoming an Eva pilot, he'd never even been on an airplane. He'd never even left the country. He sighs. Once upon a time his world had been confined to a few square miles in the suburbs outside Atami, his days filled with school and his evenings filled with homework and his weekends filled with chores and lying listlessly on his back with his headphones in his ears or his hands on his cello. As he got older, his teacher was home less and less. More often than not, the little house where he passed most of his days stood silent and empty, save for Shinji moving quietly through it like a ghost. Some days he'd hold his hand up in a patch of sunlight, as if daring it to pass through.  
真嗣不确定自己是否能适应飞行。在成为 Eva 驾驶员之前，他甚至从未坐过飞机，也从未离开过国家。他叹了口气。曾经，他的世界仅限于热海郊外几平方英里的范围，日子被学校填满，晚上则是作业，周末则是家务和懒散地躺在床上，戴着耳机或手握大提琴。随着年龄增长，他的老师在家的时间越来越少。大多数时候，他度过大部分时光的小屋静悄悄的，空无一人，除了真嗣像幽灵一样安静地穿梭其中。有些日子，他会举起手放在一束阳光下，仿佛在挑战它是否能穿透。

And then the letter came. It brought a flash of rage, bright and hot and solid. He wasn't going to come at first. His father could rot for all he cared. But the morning found him packing a bag and walking to the train station. And then his life pivoted on its axis and changed forever.  
随后，信件抵达。它带来了一阵愤怒的闪光，明亮、炽热且坚实。他起初不打算前往。他父亲如何，他毫不关心。然而，清晨时分，他却在打包行李，走向火车站。自此，他的生活发生了根本性的转变，永远改变。

His previous existence feels almost like a foreign country, thinking of it now. It's bittersweet. It means he's not quite the same person he used to be, and it happened by complete accident. The thought vaguely unsettles him. He's since fought and killed seven Angels in seven different countries, all thousands of kilometers apart. In the intervals between fights, he managed to make friends, or at least people who were interested in interacting with him on a regular basis. His gaze darts to his pack and the small camera Kensuke had gifted him inside it. He'd promised both him and Toji that he'd take lots of pictures while on his deployments. But it's too dark for a picture now. He doesn't even know where he is, or whether the growing collection of lights represents anything interesting for his friends back home.  
他过往的生活如今回想起来，仿佛是一个遥远的异国，带着苦涩与甜蜜。这表明他已非昔日之人，而这一切的发生纯属意外。这个念头让他心中泛起一丝不安。自那时起，他在七个相隔千里的不同国家与七位天使战斗并将其击败。在战斗的间隙，他结识了一些朋友，至少是那些愿意与他保持定期交流的人。他的视线落在了背包里 Kensuke 赠予他的小相机上。他曾向 Kensuke 和 Toji 许诺，在执行任务时会拍摄许多照片。然而此刻夜色已深，无法捕捉影像。 他连自己在哪儿都不清楚，更别提这些逐渐增多的灯光对家乡的朋友们是否有特别的意义了。

The pilot says words in English over the radio. Shinji watches as the transport touches down and taxis to a stop. There isn't much he can see outside the white-hot glare of the floodlights besides tarmac and equipment. Technicians scurry around like insects. A hose is dragged from the darkness and beneath the plane, out of sight. Shinji glances toward the cockpit. The pilot has sagged in his seat. Warm orange light flares briefly, and then a few moments later the smell of cigarettes begins to fill the cabin, strong and bitter. Shinji fights the urge to cough and swallows a grimace. He doesn't understand why adults do that; nothing about smoking seems pleasant. It might be a good idea to leave for a while.  
飞行员通过无线电用英语通话。真嗣目睹运输机降落并滑行至停稳。在强烈的泛光灯照射下，除了柏油路面和设备，他几乎看不到外面的其他东西。技术人员忙碌得像蚂蚁一般。一根软管从黑暗中被拖出，消失在飞机下方。真嗣瞥了一眼驾驶舱，发现飞行员已疲惫地靠在座位上。温暖的橙色灯光短暂闪烁后，不久，浓烈而苦涩的香烟味便开始充斥机舱。真嗣努力抑制住咳嗽的冲动，忍住了痛苦的表情。他不理解成年人为何要吸烟，这似乎毫无乐趣可言。或许暂时离开是个明智的选择。

He opens his bag. It's a heavy thing, longer than his torso and filled to the brim with emergency winter supplies. Each of the pilots got one, and they were instructed to take it with them into their Evas in case of emergency. Their destination was high in the mountains of South America, where snow still fell. The chances of anything going wrong were low, Misato said, but better safe than sorry. Shinji doesn't want to take the whole thing down with him. The camera goes around his neck. His radio gets clipped to his belt, because the last time he forgot it he got an earful from Misato. He's not eager to repeat the experience.  
他打开背包，里面装满了紧急冬季物资，沉重且比他的身躯还长。每位飞行员都配备了一个，并被指示在紧急情况下将其带入 Eva 机体。他们的目的地是南美洲的高山地区，那里仍有降雪。美里曾说，出问题的几率很低，但宁可谨慎也不愿事后后悔。真嗣并不想把整个背包都带下去。相机挂在他的脖子上，而无线电则夹在腰带上，因为上次他忘记携带时被美里严厉批评了一番，他可不想再经历一次那种教训。

"Excuse me," he says. "Why have we stopped?"  
“不好意思，”他问道，“我们怎么停下了？”

The pilot doesn't turn around. "Not enough fuel," he mutters. "Stuff's more expensive than it used to be, and there's not a lot of it. Still got half an ocean to go."  
飞行员并未回头，低声说道：“燃料不足。”他解释道，“如今物资价格上涨，存量有限，而我们还需跨越半个海洋。”

Shinji fights back a cough. "May I get down and stretch my legs?"  
真嗣强忍住咳嗽，问道：“我能下来活动一下腿脚吗？”

The man peers over his shoulder at him. His eyes are tired. The cigarette, lit and smoking, hangs loosely from his lips. He eyes him for a few moments, and then his gaze is broken by a truly impressive yawn.  
男子回头望向他，眼中透着疲惫。嘴边挂着点燃的香烟，烟雾缭绕。他凝视了他片刻，随后一个极为夸张的哈欠打断了他的视线。

"Sure, kid," he says, replacing the cigarette in his mouth. "Just don't wander too far. They'll have my ass if I lose ya."  
“当然，孩子，”他边说边把香烟塞回嘴里。“别走太远，不然我可要挨批了。”

Shinji nods, and then turns around, heading to the exit.  
真嗣点头示意，随即转身朝出口走去。

A wave of hot, humid air crashes into him as he opens the door. He grimaces. They dressed him in thick cargo pants and a long sleeved thermal shirt. He rolls up the sleeves, already beginning to sweat.  
门一开，热浪夹杂着湿气扑面而来，他不禁皱眉。他们让他穿上了厚实的工装裤和长袖保暖衬衫。他卷起袖子，汗水已开始渗出。

The way down to the ground is a long ladder. He remembers how scared he was the first time he climbed one, and exhales a chuckle, carefully lowering himself down the rungs. These days it's routine. He's climbed these ladders to the point it's given him calluses on his palms and a bit more strength in his limbs. Another inadvertent change.  
通往地面的路是一段长梯。他回忆起初次攀爬时的恐惧，不禁轻笑，小心翼翼地顺着梯级下移。如今，这已成为他的日常。频繁的攀爬让他的手掌磨出了茧，四肢也变得更加有力。这又是生活中不经意间的一个变化。

There's a distinct smell of seawater in the air, mixed with the harsh scents of jet fuel and what might be heated metal. Still better than the smell of smoke. His boots touch the ground, and he looks up. The vast, hulking mass of his Eva hangs suspended above him, inert for the time being. It still startles him sometimes, especially when he can see all of it at once. _He_ of all people is the one who sits in its cockpit and controls it. The hollow eye sockets glare down at him. No light shines from within their depths, but he can't quite shake the feeling of being _watched._ It's always like that around the Eva. He thinks of a bright green eye, bubbling up from a rift of pink flesh. Staring straight into his.  
空气中弥漫着一股明显的海水味，混杂着刺鼻的喷气燃料味和可能是加热金属的气味。尽管如此，还是比烟味好。他的靴子触地，抬头望去。他那庞大的 Eva 机体此刻正静止地悬挂在他上方，暂时处于休眠状态。尽管如此，有时它仍会让他感到惊讶，尤其是当他能一次看到它的全貌时。他作为驾驶员，正是那个坐在其驾驶舱中操控它的人。空洞的眼窝向下瞪视着他。眼窝深处没有光芒，但他却无法完全摆脱被注视的感觉。在 Eva 周围总是如此。他想起一只明亮的绿色眼睛，从粉红色肉体的裂缝中浮现，直直地凝视着他。

He drops his gaze. People are calling out to each other in a flurry of languages, hurrying all around him. He figures it's best to get out of their way. He looks around. At the edge of the tarmac, one lonely halogen lamp illuminates a path that disappears into the dimness. It's not terribly far away. He trots towards it. Gravel crunches under his boots. Soon enough the path curves to run parallel to a railing. A little ways down, another lonely light illuminates a weathered-looking bench and a single palm tree beside it, fronds rustling in the breeze. Shinji slows down once he reaches the little island of light and walks up to the railing in front of the bench. He hasn't wandered too far; he's within sight of the runway. A brisk breeze from the ocean carries the sounds of noise and bustle away from him. He takes a deep breath. The air is a bit muggy but otherwise fresh. It's peaceful here, or as peaceful as one can hope for in a place like this.  
他垂下目光，周围人们用各种语言匆忙地互相呼喊，四处奔波。他觉得最好还是避开他们。环顾四周，停机坪边缘，一盏孤独的氙气灯照亮了一条隐入昏暗的小径。距离并不远，他小跑着朝它走去，碎石在他的靴子下嘎吱作响。不久，小径弯曲，与一道栏杆平行。不远处，另一盏孤独的灯光照亮了一条破旧的长椅和旁边的一棵孤零零的棕榈树，树叶在微风中沙沙作响。真嗣到达这片小小的光亮之地后放慢了脚步，走到长椅前的栏杆旁。他没有走得太远，依然能看到跑道。 一阵来自海洋的清风将喧嚣与嘈杂声从他身边吹散。他深吸一口气，空气虽略显闷热，却也清新宜人。这里颇为宁静，或者说，在这样的环境中，已算是难得的平静了。

Just beyond his feet, the land ends abruptly, a sheer cliff sloping down to water that stretches beyond the horizon, glittering gently in the moonlight. The moon is bright enough that he can see the blocky silhouettes of ruined buildings jutting up above the waves like broken teeth. It looks like some city was there, once, drowned before he was born. It reminds him of Japan, of home. He begins to do stretches, groaning as his travel-weary muscles are put through their paces.  
就在他脚边，大地戛然而止，一道陡峭的悬崖直坠入水，水面一直延伸到地平线外，在月光下轻轻闪烁。月亮的光芒足以让他看清波浪上方突起的废墟建筑的轮廓，宛如破碎的牙齿。那里似乎曾有一座城市，在他出生前就已沉没。这景象让他想起了日本，想起了家乡。他开始做拉伸运动，旅途中疲惫的肌肉在拉伸中发出呻吟。

"Hey! _Dummkopf!"_ 嘿！傻瓜！

He flinches at the shrill voice. It pierces the quiet like a javelin. When he turns around, Asuka is striding towards him, backlit by floodlights. He can tell just by the way she's walking that she's not happy. She's talking rapidly into her radio. _"Ich habe -_ mmh. I found him, Misato. _Ja,_ he's a little ways off the tarmac, by a bench in the weeds. _Ja,_ he's fine. _Nein,_ I don't know why he's _not answering his radio."_  
他对那尖锐的声音畏缩了一下，那声音如同标枪般刺破了周围的宁静。当他转过身，明日香正迎面走来，被泛光灯照亮。从她走路的姿态，他就能感觉到她心情不佳。她正急促地对着对讲机说话：“我找到他了，美里。对，他在跑道外一点，靠近杂草中的一条长椅。他没事。不过，我不清楚他为何不回应对讲机。”

Asuka arrives beside him. She shoots him a glare and then flicks him hard, straight between the eyebrows. He grimaces and rubs the sore spot.  
明日香走到他身旁，瞪了他一眼，随即用力弹了一下他的额头正中。他疼得皱眉，揉着被弹痛的地方。

"Ow, Asuka, what was that for?"  
哎呀，明日香，你这是干嘛呢？

She snatches his radio from his belt. _"O mein Gott,_ I can't believe this. You didn't even turn the stupid thing…he didn't even turn the stupid thing on, Misato! Why did you even have it off in the first place? Are you s…stu…"  
她从他腰带上夺过收音机，惊呼道：“天哪，真不敢相信。你居然没打开那玩意儿……美里，他连那东西都没开！你一开始干嘛要关掉它？你是不是……傻……”

She trails off, suddenly caught by a tremendous yawn. It seems to take a lot out of her. She flips his radio on and shoves it into his hands. It immediately starts squawking in Misato's voice. Shinji sighs.  
她话说到一半，突然被一个深深的哈欠打断，显得有些疲惫。她随即打开他的收音机，塞到他手中。收音机立刻传出美里嘈杂的声音，真嗣不禁叹了口气。

"_Shinji! What did I say about keeping your radio on at all times?"_  
真嗣！我不是告诉过你，无线电要一直开着吗？

"I'm sorry, ma'am, it won't happen again."  
“抱歉，女士，这种情况不会再出现。”

Beside him, Asuka snorts. He glares back.  
在他身旁，明日香轻蔑地哼了一声。他回瞪过去。

"_It better not, or else I'll have to see about disciplinary measures. We can't lose track of you, Shinji, you're one of our most important assets."_  
最好不要这样，不然我得考虑采取纪律措施了。我们不能失去对你的关注，真嗣，你可是我们最重要的资产之一。

"Yes, ma'am. Um, by the way…where are we?"  
是的，女士。对了，顺便问一下……我们现在在哪儿？

"_Hawaii, Shinji. We're just here for a little bit to refuel, so head back to the transport soon, okay?"_  
夏威夷，真嗣。我们只是短暂停留加油，所以请尽快返回运输船，好吗？

"Yes, ma'am." 是的，女士。

Asuka has flopped down on the bench, her head sagging against the top of the backrest. She peers down her nose at him. "Look, I completely get why you'd turn that thing off. But she was freaking out because you hadn't answered for hours and hours, and it woke meup, and I made the mistake of telling her to shut up so she sent _me_ out to look for you. Just me. God forbid we disturb Miss Perfect's beauty rest."  
明日香瘫坐在长椅上，头无力地靠在靠背顶端，从鼻尖往下看着他。“听着，我完全理解你为什么要关掉那东西。但她因为几个小时都没收到你的回复而抓狂，把我吵醒了，我犯了个错误，让她闭嘴，结果她就把我打发出来找你。就我一个人。上帝保佑，别打扰了完美小姐的美容觉。”

"Sorry," says Shinji. 新司说：“对不起。”

"No you're not." 不，你不是这样的。

Asuka's dressing-down is subdued, the usually crisp, impeccable edges of her Japanese sloping downward into the valleys of her native tongue. It only happens when she's tired. He's had the opportunity to hear that particular voice often from her these days.  
明日香训斥人的声音变得柔和，她那通常清晰、无可挑剔的日语边缘，随着她的母语滑入深谷。只有在她疲惫时才会这样。他最近经常有机会听到她那种特有的声音。

"Where's the Angel now?" he asks.  
“天使现在何处？”他询问道。

"Mm. Somewhere over the Atlantic, I think. Don't you pay attention?"  
嗯，我想是在大西洋上空某处。你没留意吗？

"I was asleep." 我当时在睡觉。

"So was I. That's no excuse."  
我也一样。但这并不能成为借口。

Shinji quirks an eyebrow. "What, you can listen to the radio in your sleep?"  
真嗣挑了挑眉毛，问道：“什么意思，你睡觉时还能听收音机？”

"Yeah," says Asuka, without skipping a beat. "I'm an elite pilot, and also a genius."  
是的，" 明日香毫不犹豫地说，"我是一名精英飞行员，同时也是个天才。

_She probably just radioed Misato._ "Whatever you say."  
她大概只是用无线电通知了美里。“你爱怎么说就怎么说。”

She kicks his shin. He yelps, more out of surprise than any real pain. They subside into silence. Asuka's eyes have slid shut. Shinji watches her out of the corner of his eye. She always looks so young like that, her face serene and not all twisted up in the middle of some fierce expression. She's wearing boots and cargo pants and a long-sleeved thermal tucked in, the same as he is. Her hair isn't pinned up by her A-10 connectors, instead falling loosely about her face. It looks almost gold in the sodium glow of the streetlamp. A strange color. A strange girl from a strange land.  
她踢了他的胫骨。他惊叫一声，更多的是出于惊讶而非真正的疼痛。他们陷入了沉默。明日香的眼睛已经闭上了。真嗣从眼角观察着她。她总是那样显得很年轻，面容宁静，没有因为某种强烈的表情而扭曲。她穿着靴子、工装裤和塞在里面的长袖保暖衣，和他一样。她的头发没有被 A-10 连接器固定，而是随意地散落在脸庞周围。在路灯的钠光下，它看起来几乎是金色的。一种奇异的颜色。一个来自异乡的奇异女孩。

_She's very brave. Very smart. Very pretty, too._ He looks away from her and back over the ocean.  
她非常勇敢，非常聪明，也非常漂亮。他移开视线，再次望向大海。

After another minute or so, Asuka gets to her feet and stretches. "Come on. Nice as it is to be off the stupid plane, it's too hot out here. Let's head back. I don't want to hear Misato's voice again until we're in South America."  
大约又过了一分钟，明日香站起身来舒展身体。“好了，虽然离开那架讨厌的飞机很惬意，但外面实在太热了。我们还是回去吧。在抵达南美洲之前，我不想再听到美里小姐的声音。”

She starts walking. He follows behind her a few paces. Her hair sways in the wind. She does not look back.  
她迈步前行，他紧随其后，相隔几步之遥。风拂过她的秀发，她却未曾回首。

/

They barely make it. Shinji is watching white-crusted crags flash by beneath him, distorted by a blanket of clouds, when Hyuga starts shouting over the comms that they've confirmed a visual, 25,000 meters in the air. The transports sink as low as they can without scraping their underbellies on the mountain peaks and drop the Eva units before rocketing back into the sky.  
他们勉强成功了。真嗣正俯视着下方云层覆盖、扭曲的白垩岩壁飞速掠过，这时日向在通讯中大喊，他们已经确认了空中 25,000 米处的视觉目标。运输机尽可能降低高度，以免腹部擦到山峰，然后投放了 Eva 单位，随即急速返回天空。

Shinji takes off running as soon as Unit-01 hits the ground and immediately almost stumbles. This high up, the snow on the mountains is thick, and the slope is steep and unforgiving. Around him is a wasteland of jagged rocks and white nothingness. He tastes electric, choking terror for a moment, even through the LCL. But he gathers himself, focuses the fear, pushes through it. Failure is simply not an option. The Eva sails over deep valleys studded with the remains of once-mighty glaciers, climbs up ridges as if they were nothing more than ramps, causes avalanches of snow to slide with it down the mighty mountain flanks. Every landing makes the ground rumble. Shinji's sync rate is high enough as to allow him to feel the insistent pressure of the wind, buffeting his strong armored shoulders, but the Eva slices through it with as much regard for its whims as a boulder has for a rushing river.  
零号机刚一着陆，真嗣便立刻奔跑起来，险些摔倒。高山上积雪深厚，坡度陡峭且充满挑战。周围尽是尖锐的岩石和一片白茫茫的荒凉景象。尽管身处 LCL 中，他仍感受到了一阵电击般的窒息恐惧。但他迅速调整心态，将恐惧转化为动力，勇往直前。失败对他来说绝非选择。Eva 如同飞翔般越过深谷，那里散布着昔日壮丽冰川的遗迹，轻松攀上山脊，引发雪崩随着它从巍峨的山坡上滑落。每一次着陆都震撼着大地。 真嗣的同步率很高，足以让他感受到风不断施加的压力，冲击着他坚实的装甲肩部。然而，Eva 如同巨石面对奔涌的河流一般，对风的变幻莫测毫不在意，径直穿越而过。

He sees the Angel before Misato's shout confirms it over the comm. Troublingly, her voice breaks up about halfway through, but Shinji doesn't have too much time to think about it. The Angel is coming down over a peak, and he barely manages to climb it and turn his AT field up to maximum power before the thing is on him. He lifts his arms over his head and can't quite stop the yell that escapes his mouth. The Angel is enormous, at least ten times the length of his Eva, if not more, and he is the only thing stopping it from making contact with the rock beneath him. His knees nearly buckle as his feet are forced into the ground. His ears pop. He can barely feel his hands gripping the control yokes, but his arms are a mass of pain, throbbing and burning beneath the weight of a burden they were never meant to bear. Ayanami shouts something over the comm, garbled and pixelated, and Asuka shouts something back. A moment later, he feels the pressure lighten somewhat. "DO IT!" he screams.  
在美里通过通讯确认之前，他就已经看到了天使。然而，她的声音在通话中途出现了干扰，令人不安，但真嗣没有太多时间去细想。天使正从山峰上降下，他勉强爬上去，并在那东西扑向他之前将 AT 力场调至最大功率。他举起双臂过头，忍不住发出一声喊叫。天使巨大无比，至少是他 EVA 长度的十倍，甚至更多，而他正是阻止它接触下方岩石的唯一屏障。他的膝盖几乎要弯曲，双脚被迫陷入地面，耳朵也嗡嗡作响。 他几乎感觉不到自己紧握操纵杆的双手，但双臂却是一片剧痛，在原本不应承受的重压下跳动着、燃烧着。绫波零在通讯中大喊着什么，声音模糊且带有杂音，而明日香也回喊了些什么。片刻后，他感到压力稍有减轻。“动手吧！”他尖叫道。

"EAT THIS!" Asuka shouts, and then the pressure is gone as the Angel's AT field abruptly winks out. The three Evas are enfolded in darkness for one, two, three heartbeats, and then the world goes white and he's sent flying. He narrowly avoids biting his tongue off when he hits the ground, gagging on the taste of blood that fills his mouth. The display in front of him flickers once before restoring itself, and he flinches at the blinding daylight that suddenly streams in. He seems to have landed in a shallow valley. Several meters away from him, Asuka's red Unit-02 is sprawled against the snow like a bloodstain. He makes the Eva sit up, wincing. Ayanami's Unit-00 is nowhere to be seen.  
"吃这个！" 明日香大喊一声，随即使徒的 AT 力场突然消失，压力也随之消散。三台 EVA 在黑暗中停留了一两三下心跳的时间，然后世界变得一片空白，他被抛飞出去。落地时，他险些咬断自己的舌头，满嘴的血腥味让他作呕。面前的显示屏闪烁了一下，随即恢复正常，他因突然涌入的刺眼日光而畏缩。他似乎落入了一个浅谷。几米外，明日香的红色二号机像血迹一样躺在雪地上。他让 EVA 坐起来，感到一阵疼痛。绫波零的零号机不见踪影。

"_Shinji? Asuka? Rei?"_ Misato asks. _"Listen to me very closely. None of you have much time. Shinji, Asuka, move your Evas so they're lying on their sides facing each other. Rei, do the same thing. Don't-"_  
真嗣？明日香？丽？" 美里问道。"请你们仔细听好。你们的时间所剩无几。真嗣，明日香，让你们的 EVA 侧躺下来，面对面。丽，你也一样。不要——

Her voice vanishes abruptly. Shinji frowns and gets to his feet. Across from him, Asuka does the same.  
她的声音骤然消失。真嗣皱眉起身，对面，明日香也同时站了起来。

"_Misato, you're cutting out,"_ Asuka says. There's less than a minute of power remaining. Shinji swallows.  
"美里，你的信号断断续续，"明日香说道。电源仅剩不到一分钟。真嗣紧张地咽了口唾沫。

" _- hear me now?"_  
- 现在能听到我说话吗？

"Yes." 是的。

"_Okay. Scoop out some snow between your Evas and put the hand over the top. This will have to be -"_  
好的。在 EVA 之间挖一些雪，然后把手放在雪堆上。这一步必须——

Her voice vanishes again. Asuka's Eva is already lying on its side, its elbow resting on its torso and its hand partially embedded in the snow. Shinji mirrors its position, placing Unit-01's hand on top of Unit-02's.  
她的声音又一次消散。明日香的 EVA 已侧卧在地，肘部搭在身躯上，手部半埋于雪中。真嗣随之效仿，将初号机的手置于二号机之上。

"_- can't stay in the Eva because you will freeze. Once you've done that, eject the plug and vent the LCL and change…clo…your packs. Stay in the shelter. A blizzard…can't…pretty bad…py?"_  
- 不能留在 Eva 里，你会冻僵的。完成操作后，弹出插头，排出 LCL 并更换你的装备包。待在避难所里。外面暴风雪很严重，不能出去，对吗？

Shinji ejects the plug. Once the LCL drains, he wastes no time opening his pack. He digs until he finds the towel. He hastily depressurizes his plugsuit and dries off as much as possible before ripping open the vacuum-sealed packages of clothing. He dresses quickly. He doesn't know how they managed to fit so many layers in there. Once his coat is on, he shoulders his pack and steps outside.  
真嗣迅速弹出插入栓。待 LCL 排空后，他毫不犹豫地打开背包，翻找出一毛巾。他急忙减压驾驶服，尽可能擦干身体，随即撕开真空密封的衣物包，快速穿上。他惊讶于他们如何将多层衣物紧凑地装入包内。穿戴整齐后，他背起背包，迈步走出。

The cold hits him like a whip across the face. He feels it even through all his layers. It takes his breath away. Never before had he felt anything like it in his life. The wind buffets him, nearly causing him to fall. His eyes water. He gropes for the goggles around his neck and smashes them on his face. There's still light, but it's deteriorating rapidly. He'd better hurry. He stumbles towards Unit 01's head, going around it to pass beneath the great horn. Once he's in the space between the two Evas, the wind is marginally better. He can see Asuka making her own way towards the Evas' clasped hands, a dark dot on a field of white.  
寒风如鞭，猛烈地抽打在他脸上，即便裹着厚厚的衣物，那份刺骨的冷意依旧透骨而来，令他几乎窒息。他从未在生命中感受过如此的严寒。狂风肆虐，几乎将他掀翻在地。泪水不由自主地涌出眼眶。他急忙摸索着颈间的护目镜，迅速戴上。虽然光线尚存，但正迅速黯淡下去。他必须加快速度。他踉跄着向 01 号机的头部走去，绕过巨角，钻入两台 EVA 之间的空隙。在这里，风势稍缓。他望见明日香正艰难地向 EVA 紧握的双手移动，在一片白茫茫中，她的身影显得格外渺小。

Together, they dig their way into the shelter. It's difficult. Perhaps Asuka did what Misato said a little too well. Eventually they manage to complete a small tunnel, through which they quickly crawl. Then they block it again with snow.  
他们合力挖掘，终于通向了避难所。过程颇为艰难，或许明日香对美里的话执行得过于彻底。最终，他们挖出了一条狭窄的隧道，迅速爬行通过，随后又用雪将其封堵。

"Damn, it's dark," Asuka hisses. Shinji removes his goggles. He still can't see. He tries to stand and ends up whacking his head on Unit-02's armored palm.  
"该死，这里太黑了，" 明日香低声说道。真嗣摘下护目镜，但依然无法视物。他试图起身，却不慎一头撞上了二号机的装甲手掌。

"_Careful, Dummkopf,"_ Asuka snaps as he groans in pain and sinks to his knees. "You didn't hit yourself _that_ hard, did you?"  
小心点，笨蛋，" 明日香厉声说道，他痛苦地呻吟着跪倒在地。"你没把自己打那么重吧？

Shinji yanks a glove off and probes at his head with numb fingers. His hair, which had still been damp with LCL, is now crusted with slush. He swallows. "Um, I don't think it's bleeding." He presses on the spot, and winces when it throbs in pain. "Probably going to bruise or something, though."  
真嗣猛地脱下一只手套，用麻木的手指摸索着头部。他的头发之前还湿漉漉的，现在已结了冰渣。他咽了口唾沫，说道：“嗯，我觉得没流血。”他按了按那个地方，疼痛跳动时他皱了皱眉，“不过可能会淤青。”

"Be more careful," Asuka chides. "You saw how low the roof was."  
再小心一点，" 明日香提醒道，"你已经看到屋顶有多低了。

"Not really, I was more focused on trying to keep the blizzard out."  
其实不然，我当时更专注于抵御暴风雪的侵袭。

"Well, you should watch - OW!"  
“哎，你该看看——哎呀！”

Her voice, accompanied by a dull thudding noise, comes from somewhere to Shinji's right. Shinji doesn't think it would be a good idea to laugh, but he can't stop the smile from appearing on his face. "Asuka?" he asks, shuffling forward on his knees, hands outstretched. "Are you alright?"  
她的声音伴随着一阵沉闷的撞击声，从真嗣的右侧传来。真嗣觉得笑出来不太合适，但他还是忍不住露出了微笑。“明日香？”他一边问，一边跪着向前挪动，双手向前摸索。“你还好吗？”

The skin of his right hand brushes something soft. Asuka yelps, the sound much closer than it was, and then shoves him. Shinji crumples to the ground under the attack, where he opts to stay, suddenly drained of strength.  
他的右手不经意间触碰到了某种柔软之物。明日香惊叫一声，声音比之前更近，随即推开了他。真嗣在攻击下瘫倒在地，突然间感到浑身无力，便选择留在那里。

"_Christ,_ your hand is freezing! That was my face, stupid. Watch where you're going!"  
天啊，你的手冷得像冰！那可是我的脸，别乱摸。注意点方向！

"I'll try my best." 我会尽我最大的努力。

"Don't you _dare_ give me attitude right now, Third! Oh my God, I really hope there's a flashlight or something in these stupid packs."  
你敢现在对我摆脸色，老三！天啊，我真希望这些讨厌的包里能有个手电筒之类的。

His surroundings begin to coalesce somewhat as his eyes adjust. A faint glow filters from between Unit-02's fingers. He can see Asuka's silhouette, hunched over one of the packs. She tosses out two large bundles and then begins to rummage, muttering in German.  
随着视线逐渐清晰，周围的环境开始凝聚成形。二号机的手指间透出一丝微弱的光芒。他辨认出明日香的轮廓，她正弯腰在一个背包上。她扔出两个大包裹，然后开始翻找，嘴里用德语低声嘟囔着。

"Ah, _Ich…_I think I found something. Now if I could just figure out how to…ah!"  
啊，我……我觉得我找到了点东西。现在要是能搞明白怎么……啊！

Warm yellow light fills the shelter. Shinji squints, blinded. After a few moments, he's able to make out Asuka triumphantly holding up a small lantern. She puts it down next to him. Heat radiates from it, a faint breath of warmth in a world of cold. Shinji shuts his eyes, basking in it.  
避难所内，温暖的黄色灯光弥漫四周。真嗣被这光线刺得眯起了眼，片刻后，他才看清明日香正得意洋洋地举着一个小灯笼。她将灯笼放在他身旁，灯笼散发出的热量在这寒冷的世界中带来了一缕微弱的暖意。真嗣闭上双眼，沉浸在这份温暖之中。

Asuka nudges him. "Sit up, Shinji. You'll freeze if you stay like that."  
明日香轻轻推了他一下，说道：“真嗣，坐起来吧，你这样会冻坏的。”

"Mmh," he grunts, but does as she says. He looks at Asuka and blinks. She's rummaging through the pack again, pulling out items and tossing them aside. Her long red hair is crusted in half-frozen LCL, making it look even brighter than usual.  
"嗯，" 他低声应道，却还是依言而行。他望向明日香，目光中带着一丝疑惑。她正忙碌地在背包中翻找，取出物品随手丢弃。她那头长长的红发因沾染了半凝固的 LCL 而显得格外耀眼。

Asuka looks up and catches him staring. She frowns. "What?"  
明日香抬起头，发现他正盯着她看。她皱起眉头，问道：“怎么了？”

"Ah, your hair…" “啊，你的头发……”

"Yours doesn't look much better! I hope you brought your towel."  
你的也不怎么样！希望你带了毛巾。

"Nope, I left it in the plug."  
没有，我把它留在插座里了。

She groans. "You're hopeless, you know that? If we die of hypothermia or something it's going to be all your fault."  
她叹息着说：“你真是无可救药，知道吗？要是我们因为体温过低或其他原因丧命，那全都是你的责任。”

"How will it be my fault?!"  
这怎么会是我的错呢？！

"We can't dry our hair if we don't have towels! We'll probably freeze or get sick or something."  
没有毛巾，我们的头发就干不了！这样很可能会着凉或生病。

"We still have yours!" 我们仍然保留着你的东西！

She snorts and lifts up a crumpled wad from the snow, already stained orange. "Barely. Let's see what else Nerv gave us."  
她轻哼一声，从雪地中拾起一团皱缩的物体，早已染上橙色。“勉强能用。我们来看看 Nerv 还留了些什么给我们。”

They take inventory. Each pack contains the clothes they'd worn on the flight over, a heat lantern, a sleeping bag and a pad to go beneath it, several packages of field rations, a tiny battery-powered kettle to melt snow with, a cup, some bags, and a little booklet with survival instructions. Shinji's camera and SDAT player made it too, as well as both of their radios. He turns his on. Only the soft slush of static greets him. He switches channels to no avail.  
他们逐一清点装备。每个背包内含他们在飞行时所穿的衣物、一盏加热灯、一个睡袋及其下方的垫子、数包野战口粮、一只微型电池加热壶用于融雪、一个杯子、若干袋子，以及一本生存指南小册子。真嗣的相机和 SDAT 播放器也随包携带，两人的无线电设备亦在其中。他开启自己的无线电，却只听到微弱的静电声。他尝试更换频道，却毫无效果。

"Ugh, they didn't even include a pack of cards or something. Cheapskates," Asuka mutters, and then shucks off her coat and takes the A-10 connectors out of her hair, letting it hang freely. She starts toweling it off with shaking hands. "_Scheiße!_ This is awful," she grouses. "I don't think I've ever been this cold in my life. You're lucky. Your hair is short."  
哎，他们居然连一副扑克牌之类的都没给，真是抠门，" 明日香嘟囔着，随即脱下外套，解开发间的 A-10 连接器，任由长发披散。她颤抖着手，开始用毛巾擦拭湿发。"该死！这感觉太糟了，" 她抱怨道，"我这辈子都没这么冷过。你倒是幸运，头发短。

"I guess," says Shinji. He watches her. She manages to get rid of most of the slush and ice; the snow in front of her is speckled with orange. After a while, she tosses him the towel. Shinji buries his head in it and quickly realizes he left his neural connectors on. He tugs them off. When he finally surfaces, it's to the sight of Asuka holding one of the lanterns up near her hair. She's shivering, a slight but visible tremor.  
“我猜，”真嗣说道。他注视着她。她努力清除了大部分的泥浆和冰块；她面前的雪地上散落着橙色的斑点。片刻后，她将毛巾抛给了他。真嗣将头埋进毛巾，随即察觉自己忘了摘下神经连接器。他迅速将其扯下。当他再次抬头时，映入眼帘的是明日香手持一盏灯靠近头发的情景。她微微颤抖，虽轻微却清晰可见。

She catches his eye and a smile flits across her mouth. "Your hair's sticking up all over the place," she says, a laugh in her voice. "You look dumb."  
她迎上他的目光，嘴角轻扬，露出一抹微笑。“你的头发乱得像鸡窝，”她笑着说，“看起来真傻。”

Shinji narrows his eyes. "You don't look much better yourself."  
真嗣眯起眼睛，说道：“你看起来也不怎么样。”

Asuka's face scrunches up. "Idiot Shinji, don't you know you're not supposed to say that to a girl? Come here. Make yourself useful and hold this heat lamp. My neck's getting tired."  
明日香皱起眉头，说道：“真嗣你个笨蛋，不知道不能对女生说这种话吗？过来，帮我拿一下这个加热灯，我的脖子都酸了。”

Shinji does. Asuka turns her back to him and hugs herself tightly. "It's no blow dryer, but it'll have to do," she grits out, and then begins shaking harder. She leans forward and grabs her coat, putting it on backwards. "G-grab chunks of my hair and hold it as close to the lantern as you can. Move the l-l-lantern up and down the length of it. And don't p-pull on it. It'll hopefully dry f-faster that way. Go on, my hair's not going t-t-to burn you."  
真嗣照做了。明日香转过身去，紧紧抱住自己。“虽然不是吹风机，但也只能将就了，”她咬紧牙关说道，随后颤抖得更加厉害。她前倾身体，抓起外套反穿在身上。“抓起我头发的一束，尽量靠近灯笼。上下移动灯笼，沿着头发的长度。注意不要拉扯。这样应该会干得更快。快点，我的头发不会烫到你的。”

Most of him is convinced otherwise, and deathly afraid for it. He'd often idly wondered what it would be like to touch Asuka's pretty red hair. Shinji warily picks up a section of it. It's cold and damp to the touch, made stringy and dark by moisture. He swallows. In any other situation, she would probably hit him and start shrieking. But this isn't like any other situation. Shinji braces himself, but she keeps still, and doesn't say anything, and lets him continue touching her hair. The motion of the lantern makes their shadows lengthen and contract, almost as if they were breathing. When he comes across a tangled clump, he glances at Asuka's head. She's still facing away from him. Taking a deep breath, he cards his fingers through it, trying to unravel the knot. He brushes the clammy flesh on the back of her neck, and she flinches.  
他内心深处坚信着这一点，同时也为此感到极度恐惧。真嗣常常在闲暇时想象，触摸明日香那美丽的红色头发会是什么感觉。他小心翼翼地拿起一缕，发现它冰冷而潮湿，因湿气变得又细又暗。他咽了咽口水，心想在其他情况下，她可能会打他并开始尖叫。但此刻的情况非同寻常。真嗣鼓起勇气，而明日香却保持静止，一言不发，任由他继续触摸她的头发。灯笼的晃动使得他们的影子时而拉长，时而缩短，仿佛在呼吸一般。当真嗣遇到一团缠结时，他瞥了一眼明日香，她依然背对着他。他深吸一口气，用手指轻轻梳理，试图解开那个结。 他轻触她后颈那湿冷的皮肤，她不由得缩了一下。

"Ow! I said not to pull on it!"  
哎呀！我告诉过你别拉它！

"I can't help it! It's tangled in some spots."  
我无能为力！有些地方缠得解不开。

He continues until he's detangled the rest of her hair. She makes noise at him but doesn't pull away. The whistle of the wind outside has deepened into a roaring howl. Chills dance down his spine. His ears are freezing. His head is freezing. The hand not holding the lantern is going a bit numb. He thinks about Ayanami then. He hopes that the singular palm of her Eva was enough to keep out the wind. He hopes she made it inside. She doesn't have another person there with her to help her dry her hair.  
他继续梳理，直至解开她余下的发丝。她对他发出声响，却未曾退避。外界的风声已由尖啸转为咆哮，寒意沿着他的脊梁窜动。他的双耳与头部都感到冰冷，未持灯笼的那只手逐渐麻木。此时，他想起了绫波，希望她那独特的 EVA 手掌能抵御寒风，盼她已安全进入室内，毕竟无人能助她烘干湿发。

"I hope Ayanami's all right," he murmurs.  
“希望绫波一切安好。”他喃喃自语。

"Oh? Worried about Miss Perfect, are we? How cute."  
哦？担心那位完美小姐了，是吗？真是有趣。

"It's not like that," he says, frowning. "It's just…she's all alone out there."  
“不是那样的，”他皱眉说道，“只是……她孤零零地在外面。”

"She'll be fine." Asuka's tone is dismissive. "She's used to being by herself, it seems. She was perfectly happy to turn down Misato's dinner invite for after the mission."  
她会没事的。" 明日香语气轻蔑地说，"她好像习惯了一个人。对于美里在任务结束后邀请她共进晚餐，她完全不感兴趣。

Shinji hums noncommittally, but doesn't say anything else. Asuka shifts her weight, making his fingers pause.  
真嗣不置可否地哼了一声，随后便沉默不语。明日香调整了一下姿势，使得他的手指停顿下来。

"Hey," she murmurs. "Don't forget my scalp."  
“嘿，”她轻声提醒，“别忘了我的头皮。”

"Um, I…are you -" 呃，我…你是…

"_Yes,"_ she says emphatically. "Don't make this even weirder than it already is. I'm cold, so hurry up."  
“对，”她语气坚定，“别让这事变得更奇怪。我感到冷，所以快点吧。”

Asuka doesn't say anything when he tentatively places a hand on her scalp and frees a section of hair. He continues in silence. Her breathing is deep and even, hitching only when a shiver runs through her. Her shoulders and spine begin to slump downwards incrementally.  
当他在她头皮上小心翼翼地放上一只手，松开一缕头发时，明日香默不作声。他继续保持沉默。她的呼吸深沉而平稳，只有在颤抖时才会稍有停顿。她的肩膀和脊背开始逐渐地松弛下来。

"Asuka, lift your head please."  
明日香，请把头抬起来。

"Mm. Sorry." 嗯，对不起。

It takes him several passes with the heat lantern to get her hair somewhat dry. It's thick, and there's a lot of it. His hand twitches on her scalp and his teeth clack as the tremor that had been building in him intensifies. His ears have gone numb.  
他用热风灯反复吹了几遍，才使她的头发略显干燥。她的头发既浓密又丰盈。他的手在她头皮上不由自主地颤动，牙齿因不断加剧的震颤而发出声响。他的耳朵已经失去了知觉。

"What was that?" 那是什么东西？

"Nothing. I'm a little c-c-c-_cold,_ that's all."  
没什么，我只是有点冷而已。

"Just a little, huh?" Asuka's hand comes up and strokes her hair. "Wow. Not bad, Shinji. I think we can stop here for now." She turns and grabs the lantern from him. "Turn around."  
就一点点，对吧？" 明日香抬起手，轻抚着她的头发。"哇，真嗣，做得不错。我想我们可以暂时停在这里。" 她转过身，从他那里拿过灯笼。"转过身去。

"Hm?"

"It's your turn now." 现在该你上场了。

"Wh…okay." 嗯...好吧。

The warmth of the lamp near his head is heavenly. Shinji barely manages to suppress a groan. Asuka's hand in his hair is brusque and does not linger, but the places where her fingers touch his scalp still manage to send bolts of lightning arcing down his spine.  
他头旁那盏灯的温暖宛如天堂。真嗣勉强压制住一声呻吟。明日香的手在他头发中虽显粗鲁且并不停留，但她手指触碰之处，仍能让他感到脊椎如电击般震颤。

"Geez, stop flinching," Asuka mutters. "I'm not going to burn you."  
哎呀，别躲了，" 明日香低声说，"我不会烧到你的。

"Sorry - ow! Please watch the bump."  
抱歉——哎哟！请留意那个凸起。

"Ah, yeah. Sorry." 啊，对。不好意思。

She gently tugs at his hair, lengthening it to bring it as close to the lamp as she can. Her hand is cold, but he doesn't mind. He realizes that he has never had someone else's hand in his hair before. He didn't know it could feel so nice. His right hand flexes on his lap as a feeling of guilt materializes in his chest.  
她轻柔地拉扯着他的发丝，尽量拉长，让发梢尽可能贴近灯光。她的手触感冰凉，但他并未在意。他意识到，自己从未体验过他人手指轻抚发间的感受，原来竟是如此惬意。他的右手在膝上微微屈伸，心中却莫名涌起一丝愧疚之情。

"Okay, you should be good to go. Can you do mine again, one more time?"  
好的，你应该可以开始了。能再帮我一次吗，就这一次？

The warmth of the lamp and the weight of Asuka's hand disappear. Shinji feels oddly forlorn as he turns around.  
灯光的温暖与明日香手的重量不复存在。真嗣转身之际，心中涌起一股莫名的孤寂感。

Once he finishes, they eat one ration bar each and heat up some snow. Then they begin unrolling their sleeping pads, and then the bags atop them. They set up on opposite sides of the small shelter, with the heat lanterns placed in the half-meter or so of no man's land between them. Asuka glares at him from behind the bright barrier, the illumination from below giving her features a menacing cast. "No funny business, got it? If you even stick one finger past these lanterns, I'll make sure you lose it."  
他一完成任务，他们便各自吃了一块口粮，并加热了一些雪。随后，他们开始铺开睡垫，接着在上面放置睡袋。两人在小庇护所的两侧安顿下来，中间约半米宽的空地上放置着热灯。明日香从明亮的屏障后瞪视着他，下方的光线让她的面容显得格外严厉。“别动歪脑筋，明白吗？只要你敢越过这些灯哪怕一根手指，我保证你会付出代价。”

"All right, Asuka." 好的，明日香。

"Now I don't know about you, but I'm going to try and sleep."  
我不知道你怎么样，反正我要试着睡一会儿了。

He removes his jacket and outer pants, remembering the briefing they'd gotten on cold weather safety, and shivers as he slides into his sleeping bag. He puts his earbuds in, clutching his SDAT to him to warm it up a bit before turning it on and hitting play. No sound comes out. He pulls it out to look at it. It didn't even turn on. He bites the inside of his cheek. He really hopes it isn't broken. Can cold weather do that to electronics? He stuffs the SDAT back into his sleeping bag and sighs. He always has trouble falling asleep without it.  
他脱掉夹克和外裤，回想起关于寒冷天气安全的简报，滑进睡袋时打了个寒颤。他塞上耳塞，紧抱 SDAT，想先暖暖它再开机播放。然而，没有任何声音传出。他取出 SDAT 检查，发现它根本没开机。他咬了咬内颊，心中祈祷它没坏。难道寒冷天气真能损坏电子产品？他无奈地将 SDAT 塞回睡袋，叹了口气。没有它，他总是难以入眠。

He opts instead to look up at the ceiling. Red armor. Familiar and yet strange. And over it is Unit-01's purple. The wind howls louder than ever. Unit-02's palm moves incrementally as the wind outside does its best to tear it away. He swallows. Even an Eva isn't totally safe from the wrath of a blizzard after all. It makes him feel very small, suddenly. He shivers a little. Despite all his layers and the thick sleeping bag wrapped around him, he's still a bit cold. Would Nerv be able to find them once this was all over? He remembers the field of smooth, blinding white that greeted him once he'd dropped from the transport, stretching up the unforgiving slopes of the mountains and down into the valleys below. Who knew what lurked beneath it? Perhaps Misato and the others would arrive and pass right over the two pilots buried alive in the snow.  
他决定抬头望向天花板，红色装甲既熟悉又陌生，上面还覆盖着初号机的紫色。风声比以往任何时候都更加响亮，二号机的手掌在风中微动，仿佛外面的风正竭力将其撕裂。他咽了口唾沫，意识到即使是 EVA 也无法完全抵御暴风雪的威力，这让他突然感到自己非常渺小。尽管裹着厚厚的睡袋和多层衣物，他仍感到一丝寒意。Nerv 能在这一切结束后找到他们吗？他记得从运输机上下来时迎接他的那片平滑刺眼的白色原野，它沿着无情的山坡向上延伸，向下深入山谷，谁知道它下面潜藏着什么？ 也许 Misato 他们抵达时，会直接从那两位被活埋在雪中的飞行员上方经过。

He turns. Asuka is wrapped in her sleeping bag, her face hidden in shadow. He isn't sure if she's asleep or not. "Hey, Asuka," he tries. "Do you know how long a blizzard lasts?"  
他转身望去，只见明日香裹在睡袋中，面容隐于暗影。他无法判断她是否已入梦乡。“明日香，”他轻声唤道，“你知道一场暴风雪通常会持续多长时间吗？”

"I don't know. Snow is just frozen water, so it's probably like a rainstorm. We're going to get woken up by Misato's squawking in a few hours."  
我不清楚。雪不过是冰冻的水，大概和暴雨差不多吧。再过几个小时，Misato 的吵闹声就会把我们吵醒。

Her voice sounds so light and nonchalant. Like she's not even bothered by this at all, or perhaps unaware of the danger. But Asuka is far from stupid.  
她的声音轻快而随意，仿佛对此毫不在意，甚至可能未察觉到危险。然而，明日香绝非愚笨之人。

"But what if it snows so much that we're completely buried? What if they can't find us once it's over?"  
但如果雪下得太大，我们被彻底掩埋了怎么办？雪停后他们找不到我们又该如何是好？

"Stop asking stupid questions," Asuka snaps. Shinji is taken aback by the sudden venom in her voice. "Of course they're going to find us. The Evas have trackers on them."  
别再问那些愚蠢的问题了，"明日香突然厉声说道。真嗣被她声音中的恶意吓了一跳。"他们肯定会找到我们的，Eva 上装有追踪器。

"Will that still work if the Evas freeze solid? _Can_ Evas even freeze?"  
如果 Eva 完全冻结，它还能正常运作吗？Eva 这种物质能被冻结吗？

"No, stupid. I don't think so. They're too big for that. Now shut up and go to sleep."  
不，傻瓜。我觉得不行。它们太大了，不适合那样。现在安静点，去睡觉吧。

"I know they're on low power mode now," Shinji murmurs. "But will they be able to last longer than the blizzard?"  
我知道他们现在处于低功耗模式，" 真嗣低声说道，"但他们能否撑过这场暴风雪呢？

"_Shut UP!"_ Asuka snaps. Her voice is deafening in the tiny space. Shinji jerks, startled. "I don't care, okay?! Just shut up. Everything will be _fine,_ so there's no use asking stupid questions about stupid what-ifs. Just shut up and go to sleep!"  
闭嘴！" 明日香厉声喝道。她的声音在狭小的空间里震耳欲聋。真嗣吓了一跳，身体一颤。"我不在乎，好吗？！闭嘴就行了。一切都会好起来的，所以问那些愚蠢的假设性问题毫无意义。闭嘴，去睡觉吧！

"Sorry," he mutters reflexively. He isn't sure what exactly he's apologizing for, or why Asuka got so angry.  
“抱歉，”他不由自主地低声说道。他并不清楚自己究竟为何道歉，也不理解明日香为何如此愤怒。

He tries to fall asleep, but he can't. It's too cold. The wind is too loud. It strikes him, then, how alone the two of them are. They might as well be the last people on Earth. Who knows how long they'll be trapped inside this shelter, so small and low that neither of them can stand up straight? Shinji swallows. The only things keeping them from certain death are a few ration bars, giant hands, and some sleeping bags. His hand flexes. He should not have come here. Asuka was right. This was barely an operation. All three of them would probably freeze to death in a remote corner on the godforsaken tip of South America. Close to Antarctica. His father is in the remains of Antarctica right now. Maybe it's all connected somehow - the Angel, his father, descending on him. The sound of the wind is nothing compared to the glacial silence between him and Asuka. Between him and his father. A cold grave. Angry words. _I want to die. I don't want to die._  
他努力想入睡，却无法入眠。天气太冷，风声又太吵。他突然意识到，他们俩是多么孤独。他们仿佛是地球上仅存的人类。谁知道他们还要在这狭小低矮的避难所里被困多久，以至于两人都无法挺直腰板？真嗣咽了口唾沫。唯一能让他们免于死亡的，只有几块配给粮、一双大手和几个睡袋。他的手不由自主地握紧。他不该来这里的。明日香说得没错。这根本算不上什么行动。他们三个很可能会在南美洲最南端这个荒凉的角落里冻死，靠近南极洲。他的父亲此刻就在南极洲的废墟之中。或许这一切都以某种方式联系在一起——天使、他的父亲，正向他逼近。 风声在明日香和他、他与父亲间那冰封的沉默面前，显得无足轻重。那是冰冷的墓地，充斥着愤怒的言辞。他渴望解脱，却又害怕离去。

"Why did the Angel come so close to Antarctica?" he asks in a voice like ice splintering. "Do you think it has something to do with Second Impact?" Asuka doesn't say anything. He wets his dry lips. "Why do the Angels attack where they do?"  
“天使为何会如此接近南极？”他以冰裂般的声音发问，“你认为这与第二次冲击有关吗？”明日香沉默不语。他润了润干裂的嘴唇，继续问道：“天使为何选择那些地方进行攻击？”

Asuka still doesn't say anything. When he rolls over, he sees that she's on her side, her back to him. He can't see her face. Distant as the moon, as scorchingly caustic as the sun. _Mama,_ he hears her say, with tears leaking from beneath her closed eyelids.  
明日香依旧沉默不语。当他翻身时，发现她侧卧着，背对着他，无法看到她的面容。她如同月亮般遥远，又似太阳般炽热而尖锐。妈妈，他听见她哽咽着说，泪水悄然从紧闭的眼睑下流出。

He will never understand her.  
他永远无法理解她。

He rolls onto his side to face away from her, but sleep will not come. Eventually he gives up and reaches for the safety pamphlet that Nerv included in their packs. It's dry and concise, including not just survival skills but information about their gear as well. The sleeping bags can zip together, with heat being preserved through the fact that they would retain their individual hoods. The rations should ideally last them a week.  
他侧身躺下，背对着她，却无法入睡。最终，他放弃了尝试，拿起 Nerv 在他们背包中附带的安全手册。手册内容虽枯燥但简洁，不仅涵盖了生存技能，还详细介绍了他们的装备。睡袋可以通过拉链连接，同时保留各自的头罩以保持体温。按理说，这些口粮足够他们维持一周。

/

He surfaces from a fitful doze an undeterminable amount of time later because his teeth are chattering. He rolls over onto his back and glances to his left. Asuka is curled up in a ball facing him. Their eyes meet. The look on her face is strange. If he didn't know better, he'd say it was almost _afraid._  
他因牙齿打颤而从断断续续的浅睡中惊醒，无法判断过去了多久。他翻过身仰躺着，向左侧望去。明日香蜷缩成一团，正对着他。两人的视线交汇。她脸上的表情颇为异样，若非更为了解，他几乎会认为那是恐惧。

"Any word from Misato?" Shinji croaks. He's barely able to get the words out.  
‘Misato 有没有提到什么？’ Shinji 嘶哑地问道，几乎难以发出声音。

"Do you think we'd still be in here if there was?" Asuka snaps back, brows furrowing. Shinji sighs. She's clearly still in a bad mood. It would probably be best if he didn't disturb her further. He's on the verge of rolling over again when Asuka takes a deep, shuddering breath.  
"你觉得如果真有那种情况，我们还会被困在这里吗？" 明日香回呛道，眉头紧皱。真嗣叹了口气，她显然心情不佳。他最好别再惹她。就在他准备再次翻身时，明日香深吸了一口气，身体微微颤抖。

"Look. I think we ought to look at the big picture. Let's push our mats together, and our bags, too. I don't…I don't want to freeze out here."  
你看，我觉得我们得从大局考虑。把我们的垫子合在一起，包也放一块儿。我不想……我不想在这儿冻坏了。

"Okay," says Shinji. "I don't want to freeze either."  
好吧，" 真嗣说道，"我也不想被冻僵。

Climbing out of the sleeping bag is agonizing, but pushing the mats and bags close together doesn't take very long. Shinji finds himself lying with his back pressed against Asuka's. For a time, Asuka doesn't say anything. Shinji doesn't either. It's still cold and dark, but her body is solid against his, even through the sleeping bags. It's a small comfort. For a brief, insane moment, Shinji wonders what it would feel like to pull her close. He shakes his head and banishes the thought. She would destroy him utterly.  
从睡袋中艰难地爬出令人痛苦，但将垫子和袋子推拢在一起并不费时。真嗣发现自己背靠背地与明日香躺在一起。起初，明日香沉默不语，真嗣亦然。尽管四周依旧寒冷且昏暗，但她的身体透过睡袋紧贴着他，带来一丝慰藉。在那一瞬间，真嗣心中闪过一个疯狂的念头：如果将她拥入怀中会是什么感觉？他随即摇头，将这想法抛诸脑后。她可能会彻底击垮他。

"Hey, Asuka?" 嘿，明日香吗？

"Mm."

"Why do you pilot Eva?"  
你为何要驾驶 Eva？

The reply is instantaneous. "To show the world how talented I am, naturally."  
回复立刻就来了。“当然是为了向世人展示我的才华。”

"To let them know that you exist?"  
让他们了解你的存在吗？

"Mhm. Something like that. What about you? Why do you do it?"  
嗯，差不多就是这样。你呢？为什么要做这件事？

Shinji considers the question, a small crease appearing between his brows. "I don't know."  
真嗣沉思着这个问题，眉头轻轻皱起。“我不清楚。”

"You don't know?" Asuka shifts against him. "We're out here on a mountain in the middle of nowhere and you don't know? Are you stupid?"  
你不知道吗？" 明日香向他靠了靠。"我们在这荒无人烟的山里，你居然不知道？你是不是傻？

"Mm. I might be." 嗯，我或许是的。

She scoffs. "You really are, talking like that."  
她不屑一顾地说：“你真是的，说话这么冲。”

"How long have you been training for Eva anyway, Asuka?"  
话说回来，你已经训练了多长时间了，绫波？

He's never asked her about her life back in Germany. All he knew was that she had a college degree - in what, he didn't know - and had been training for Eva a lot longer than he had. He didn't know what that training consisted of. She certainly seemed to enjoy piloting Eva.  
他从未询问过她在德国的生活经历。他仅知道她拥有大学学位，具体专业却不甚了解，而且她接受 Eva 的训练时间远比他长久。至于训练内容，他一无所知。不过，她似乎非常享受驾驶 Eva 的过程。

"Since I was four years old," she says. There's a note of pride evident in her voice.  
“从四岁开始，”她说话时，声音里透着明显的自豪感。

"Wow," he says. "Did…did your parents force you to do it?"  
“哇，”他问道，“是你父母逼你做的吗？”

"Of course not," she says. "They didn't say anything about it. I was chosen. And I wanted to do it. Unlike you, apparently. You don't enjoy it at all?"  
当然没有，" 她回答道。"他们对此只字未提。我被选中，并且我愿意去做。显然，你并不情愿。你难道一点儿也不喜欢吗？

Shinji's shoulders twitch in a shrug, even though she can't see him. "Not really."  
尽管她看不见，真嗣的肩膀还是微微耸动，表示无所谓。“其实也不算什么。”

"So your father is forcing you to do it?"  
“这么说，你父亲是在强迫你做这件事吗？”

"Not really." 不完全是。

"Hmph. I'd ask why you don't live with the guy, but…he doesn't seem very paternal."  
哼，我本想问你为何不与他同住，但……他似乎并不具备父亲的特质。

"He isn't." 他并非如此。

"My father isn't either," says Asuka lowly. "But…we get along, I guess. I haven't talked to him in a while. I used to live with him and Mother when I was smaller. But that was a long time ago."  
我父亲也不是，" 明日香轻声说道，"不过…我想我们相处得还算融洽。我已经有一段时间没和他交流了。小时候我和他还有母亲一起生活过，但那都是很久以前的事了。

"That sounds nice," says Shinji. "A family to come home to. I'm a little jealous."  
那听起来真好，" 真嗣说道。"有个温馨的家可以回去。我有点羡慕呢。

"It only seems that way. My mother isn't even my real mother."  
“看起来是这样，但其实我妈妈并不是我的亲生母亲。”

"What…what happened to your real mother?"  
你的亲生母亲…她怎么了？

"She died," Asuka says simply.  
明日香简单地说：“她去世了。”

"Oh," says Shinji. "I'm sorry to hear that." He wets his lips. "Do you remember her?"  
哦，" 真嗣说道，"听到这个消息我很难过。" 他舔了舔嘴唇，"你还记得她吗？

"A little." 一点点。

"That's lucky. My mother died too. But I don't really remember her at all."  
真巧，我母亲也不在了。不过我对她几乎没有任何记忆。

"Hmm, I figured. That or a divorce. But that's not so bad. It's less painful that way, isn't it?"  
嗯，我猜到了。要么是这样，要么是离婚。但这也没那么糟糕。这样更不痛苦，不是吗？

"I suppose. But still. I don't have any pictures of her or anything."  
我想应该是吧。不过，我没有任何她的照片或其他东西。

"Why not?" 为何不呢？

"My father destroyed them."  
我父亲把它们都毁掉了。

"Oh."

Silence falls. Shinji blinks. In this one conversation, he learned more about Asuka than he did in several months of living with her, of traveling the world with her, of fighting side by side with her. Her calm frankness shocks him. He squeezes his eyes shut, suddenly embarrassed.  
寂静笼罩四周。真嗣眨眼间，发现通过这次简短的对话，他对明日香的了解竟超过了与她共处数月、周游世界以及并肩作战的时光。她那平静而直率的言辞令他震惊。真嗣突然感到一阵尴尬，不由得紧闭双眼。

"Sorry for dumping all that on you," he murmurs.  
“抱歉一下子把这么多事都推给你，”他轻声说道。

"It's not like I have anything else to do right now."  
“我现在也没什么其他事情要做。”

"Oh, so you're bored?" 哦，这么说你感到无聊了？

"Extremely." 非常。

Shinji takes a deep breath. Asuka seems to have none of his qualms. That must be what it meant to be an elite pilot. No troublesome thoughts. Only action. He's tempted to ask her for her training regimen.  
真嗣深吸一口气，明日香似乎毫无他的那些顾虑。这或许就是成为精英飞行员的真谛：摒弃杂念，唯有行动。他不禁想向她请教训练方法。

"Shinji," Asuka whispers after a time. "I'm still cold."  
真嗣，" 片刻后，明日香轻声说道，"我依然感到寒冷。

"Me too," he murmurs, and shivers.  
“我也是。”他轻声说道，随即打了个寒颤。

"The bags can zip together, you know."  
你知道吗，这些包可以用拉链连在一起。

"I know." 我明白。

They don't say anything else. Asuka rolls away from him, and his body flops down in the space she left. The antarctic chill blasts him when he exits his sleeping bag, but he and Asuka work quickly. They don't look at each other. His heart is pounding in his chest. He feels a little lightheaded. He climbs back into the sleeping bag.  
他们没有再多说什么。明日香从他身边滚开，他的身体随即倒在明日香留下的空隙中。当他从睡袋里出来时，南极的寒风猛烈地吹向他，但他和明日香迅速行动起来。他们没有看对方。他的心脏在胸腔里狂跳。他感到有点头晕。他又爬回了睡袋。

"Hurry up," Asuka grumbles, and then follows after him.  
"快点，"明日香嘟囔着，随后跟了上去。

As soon as the zipper closes, they reach for each other. It's cramped, and awkward, and Asuka's elbows are very, very sharp. Her grip on him is so tight it's hard to breathe, but Shinji finds he doesn't mind. For a time, they shiver against each other, teeth chattering from their recent exposure to the cold outside, but little by little, they stop. Asuka's body becomes delightfully, wonderfully warm against his. He didn't know that another person could be this warm. Asuka sighs. She turns and buries her head against him. Her hair, still slightly damp, tickles his nose. It smells strongly of LCL, and something that might be sweat, and a faint trace of shampoo, and something else, something he can't put a name to. Shinji takes a breath.  
拉链一合上，他们便紧紧相拥。空间狭小，姿势别扭，明日香的肘部尖锐得让人不适。她紧紧抓住他，力度之大几乎让他难以呼吸，但真嗣发现自己并不介意。起初，他们因刚从外面的寒冷中回来而颤抖着，牙齿打战，但渐渐地，颤抖停止了。明日香的身体在他身边变得异常温暖，令人愉悦。他从未想过一个人的体温可以如此温暖。明日香叹了口气，转身将头埋在他胸前。她的头发微湿，轻轻挠着他的鼻子，散发着 LCL 的气味，混杂着汗水和淡淡的洗发水香，还有某种他无法形容的气息。真嗣深吸了一口气，感受着这一切。

"Don't say anything," Asuka murmurs.  
"别出声，" 明日香轻声说道。

"Okay," he murmurs back. “好的，”他轻声回道。

"What did I just say? Idiot."  
我刚才说什么了？真是白痴。

He exhales a laugh. Typical Asuka. "Sorry."  
他轻笑一声，典型的明日香风格。“抱歉。”

"Stop apologizing! I swear, that's all you ever do."  
别再老是道歉了！我真是受够了。

"S…okay." S…好吧。

Silence falls. Asuka's breathing deepens. His head tilts just the slightest bit downwards so his mouth is pressed to the skin right next to her hairline, half-masked by her messy fringe. In the movies, friends and family would sometimes kiss each other on the forehead. So did lovers. He thinks of Asuka standing proudly on a bench, bathed in the warm glow of a sunset. He's half asleep. His lips pucker unthinkingly. Something like that. Once. Twice. Again.  
寂静笼罩四周。明日香的呼吸愈发深沉。他的头轻轻低下，嘴唇贴在她发际线旁的肌肤上，半隐于她散乱的刘海之中。电影里，朋友和家人常会在额头上互吻，恋人亦然。他想起明日香骄傲地站在长椅上，沐浴在夕阳的温暖光辉中。他有些昏昏欲睡，嘴唇不自觉地微微撅起，轻轻地，一次，两次，再吻一次。

Asuka whispers something unintelligible in what might be German. Her arm tightens around him.  
明日香低声呢喃着一些难以理解的德语，她的手臂紧紧环绕着他。

Shinji is finally able to fall asleep.  
真嗣终于可以安然入睡了。

/

The Nerv crew finds them eventually. Asuka's radio starts squawking and shortly after that they're pulled from their shelter, dazed and blinded by the reflection of the sunlight off the snow. Misato tells them they were in there for two nights. She pulls them both into a hug, and then steps back, her nose wrinkled.  
Nerv 小队最终找到了他们。明日香的无线电突然响起，不久他们便被从避难所中带出，因雪地反射的阳光而感到眩晕和眼花。美里告诉他们已经在这里度过了两个夜晚。她紧紧拥抱了两人，随后退开，皱起了鼻子。

"The two of you smell like LCL and sweat. The first thing you're doing when we get back to civilization is taking a bath."  
你们俩身上一股 LCL 和汗水的味道。等我们回到文明世界，第一件事就是去洗个澡。

"Thank God," Asuka says. "And then dinner, right? I hope you didn't forget."  
感谢上帝，"明日香说道，"接下来是晚餐，对吧？希望你没忘记。

"Of course not." 当然不是。

They're quickly ushered into a tent. Ayanami is already there, a blanket wrapped around her shoulders and a steaming mug of hot chocolate clutched in one hand. Shinji and Asuka receive similar treatment. Asuka happily chatters about what exactly she's going to make Misato buy them for dinner. Shinji sips his hot chocolate and smiles at Ayanami.  
他们迅速被引导进入一个帐篷。绫波零已在其中，肩披毛毯，一手握着热气腾腾的热巧克力。真嗣和明日香也得到了类似的照顾。明日香兴奋地讨论着她打算让美里为他们晚餐买些什么。真嗣品尝着热巧克力，向绫波投以微笑。

"I'm glad you're okay," he says. "How'd it go for you?"  
我很高兴你没事，" 他说。"你那边情况如何？

"Much the same as always," Ayanami replies. She looks at him over the rim of her cup as she takes a sip.  
"还是老样子，"绫波答道。她一边小口喝着杯中的饮品，一边透过杯口望向他。

"This is delicious. I am glad you survived as well."  
这真是太美味了。我很高兴你也安然无恙。

Misato comes in later with a tablet clutched in one hand. She taps a few things on it, and then a call comes in. It's his father. Misato delivers her report in clipped, curt tones. And then -  
美里稍后手持平板电脑进入房间，迅速操作了几下，随即接到一通电话，来电者正是他的父亲。她以简洁明了的语气汇报了情况，随后——

"Good work, Shinji," Gendo Ikari says.  
"真嗣，做得不错，"碇源堂说道。

Shinji blinks a few times. Something strange is happening in his chest. "Th-thank you," he manages to say, and shortly afterwards the call ends.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，感觉胸口有些异样。他费力地说出：“谢谢你。”通话随即结束。

Asuka nudges him. "Wow," she says, smirking. "He actually said something nice to you."  
明日香轻轻推了他一下，笑着说：“哇，他竟然对你说了些好话。”

He sighs. The corners of his mouth curl up just a little. "I guess."  
他轻叹一声，嘴角微微勾起。“我想应该是吧。”

"I know." 我明白。

Shinji exhales a laugh. He's never felt so warm.  
真嗣轻笑一声，他从未感到如此温暖。

### Comment
[Romulo Nidoking BR](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/109777/Romulo-Nidoking-BR): Bravo! An opening scene that at the same time provides the setup and keeps the mystery, with a rarely explored theme of deploying Evangelion in other parts of the world.  
精彩绝伦！开场场景不仅巧妙地铺设了故事背景，还保留了神秘色彩，更涉及了一个少有人触及的主题——在全球各地部署福音战士。  
  
Then, things get more confusing as Asuka appears, speaking in an adorable mix of fanfiction German and English (and only now I noticed that they are crossing the Pacific, not the Atlantic, lol). A nice first Asushin setup, followed by the battle scene.  
随后，情况变得愈发扑朔迷离，明日香登场，她那可爱的德语与英语混搭口音让人忍俊不禁（直到此刻我才意识到她们穿越的是太平洋而非大西洋，真是搞笑）。这是一个精彩的 Asushin 组合序幕，紧随其后的是紧张刺激的战斗场面。  
  
And then, to my amusement, we got a well-foreshadowed scenario of freezing Evas, with Shinji and Asuka being trapped together that evoked great memories about the classic older-than-dust lemon fic "Body Heat", by Axel, and led to some very cute Asushin moments that lead to the inevitable bedtime conversation with the bonus points that they are alone and isolated from the rest of the world, however, in quite a contrast with the EoE beach scene, culminating in the best way possible for them to get closer and warm up each other. The conversation and follow-up ending scene were nice (Rei with hot chocolate should be a merch thing) concluding this very beautiful and warming (pun intended). On a side note the exact 7000 words highlights the effort put into this and the fact that the word count limit - while needed - was a party-popper because I wanted to read more of this.  
接着，让我感到有趣的是，我们目睹了一个精心预示的冻结 Eva 场景，真嗣和明日香被困在一起，唤起了对经典老掉牙的柠檬小说《Body Heat》（作者：Axel）的美好回忆，并引发了一些非常可爱的 Asushin 时刻。最终，他们独自一人、与世隔绝的睡前对话不可避免地到来，与 EoE 海滩场景形成鲜明对比，这一切以最好的方式让他们彼此靠近并温暖对方。对话和随后的结尾场景都很美好（丽喝热巧克力的场景应该成为商品），为这个非常美丽且温暖（双关语）的故事画上句号。 附带一提，确切的 7000 字数不仅体现了投入的努力，也表明了字数限制虽有必要，却让我感到遗憾，因为我渴望读到更多这样的内容。  
  
Congratulations to the champion! Thanks for writing this.  
恭喜冠军！感谢你撰写了这篇文章。

[Born2Walken](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/15849647/Born2Walken): Another excellent little one shot from the great noodle! This was a really cool idea as there are very few one shots that take place in the timespan of the show that actually take place in an alternate universe rather than the established canon. The fact that this is a world where the pilots have to travel all around the world to fight angels and aren’t just situated in Japan is a really cool fresh breath of air. It most likely was done so that the main setup could actually happen but even still it’s a really cool and interesting version of Eva that I absolutely would love to read more from. Right from the get go it’s very noticeable how well written this short story is through the opening and in it’s way of introducing Shinji into this new environment, it really feels like it’s right out of a professional novel. These early parts do a good job of putting us in Shinji’s shoes as we see him going through the motions of this crazy new world and life he’s been thrust into. Asuka’s interactions with Shinji all feel very natural and in character. The scene on the bench paints their current relationship clearly as there’s definitely something there but sadly there is still very much a distinct distance between the two. The idea of the Eva Units being shot out of the air to fight angels on the slopes of mountains is an awesome visual and you illustrate the surrounding chaos well. The actual setup of getting Unit 1 and 2 to connect their palms in order to make a shelter is both a great survival idea as well as a great trapped in a bottle set up for the two pilots. Both are forced to be as close as possible with the extreme cold preventing them from partaking in their usual frustrating behavior of fully closing themselves off from one another. I love how the necessary actions of drying each other's hair is a way for them to feel a little more comfortable around each other and unintentionally chip at each other’s defenses. The two units holding each other is also a very fitting and symbolic image for the two keeping each other safe and starting to open up to one another. Of course they realistically hold off as long as they can from opening up and the lantern in the middle to me serves as almost an AT field that cold continues to make ever so weaker. It’s also interesting that the dire situation makes Shinji less hesitant and shy while Asuka's lack of confidence shows a little bit. You really get a sense that the two sadly benefit a lot from a forced situation like this and it’s cathartic when the cold becomes so unbearable that the two must lay close to each other. Also like how all this makes to two more willing to talk about themselves in a way that they sadly never did in the series and it says a lot about how just a short conversation tells the two about each other more than piloting for several months has showing the way to truly bond with someone is to be open and let your guard down to a degree. The two sharing a sleeping bed is absolute bliss and I love how Shinji kisses her forehead through pure instinct right before he passes out. The final scene wraps everything in a nice little bow and you can really tell that Asuka and Shinji have come out of this experience as better people who have a much stronger bond than before. The last scene empathizes this by having a much more heart warming version of Gendo telling his son good job and it’s not really because of the fact Gendo acknowledges Shinji but because it further empathizes how the pilots now further understand and support each other With Asuks's playful comment. It’s my hope the two will look back to this moment and see this as the turning point in their lives in this universe.  
来自伟大面条的又一精彩短篇！这个故事设定在非正统宇宙中，与节目时间线内的其他短篇不同，它打破了既定框架。在这个世界里，驾驶员们必须环游世界去对抗天使，而非仅限于日本，这种设定带来了新鲜感。虽然这样做可能是为了实现主要情节，但这个版本的 EVA 确实引人入胜，我非常期待能读到更多相关作品。 从一开始，这个短篇故事的优秀文笔就非常引人注目，无论是开头还是如何将真嗣引入新环境，都让人感觉仿佛出自一本专业小说。故事初期很好地让我们感同身受，随着真嗣经历这个疯狂新世界的种种，我们仿佛也置身其中。明日香与真嗣的互动自然而贴切，长椅上的场景清晰地展现了他们微妙的关系——确实有些情感，但两人之间仍有着明显的隔阂。Eva 机体从空中被射出，在山坡上与天使战斗的设想极具视觉冲击力，你成功地描绘了那混乱的战场。 让单元 1 和单元 2 通过手掌相连来搭建庇护所的实际操作，既是一个出色的生存策略，也是两位飞行员被困瓶中的巧妙设置。极端寒冷迫使他们尽可能靠近，无法进行他们通常那种完全封闭自己的恼人行为。我喜欢他们必须互相吹干头发的动作，这让他们在彼此身边感到更自在，并不经意间削弱了对方的防御。两个单元相互拥抱的画面也非常贴切和象征性，代表着他们互相保护并开始向对方敞开心扉。 当然，他们尽可能长时间地避免打开和中间的灯笼，对我而言，这灯笼仿佛是一个不断减弱的 AT 力场。有趣的是，这种危急情况让真嗣变得不那么犹豫和害羞，而明日香的缺乏自信则稍有显露。你确实能感受到两人在这种被迫的情况下获益良多，当寒冷变得无法忍受时，两人必须紧紧相依，这种转变令人感到一种释放。 同样，这一切如何促使两人更愿意以一种在系列中令人遗憾地从未有过的方式谈论自己，这表明仅仅一次短暂的对话就能让两人比共同驾驶几个月更了解对方，真正与某人建立联系的方式是开放自己并适度放下防备。两人共享一张床铺是绝对的幸福，我喜欢真嗣在昏倒前纯粹本能地亲吻她的额头。最后一幕将一切都完美地收尾，你真的可以看出明日香和真嗣通过这次经历成为了更好的人，他们的关系比以前更加牢固。 最后一幕通过展现一个更加温馨的场景，源堂称赞他的儿子做得好，这不仅是因为源堂认可了真嗣，更是进一步强调了现在驾驶员们如何更深刻地理解和支持彼此，正如明日香那句俏皮话所体现的。我希望两人能回顾这一刻，并将其视为他们在这个宇宙中生活的转折点。

[Wing Zero Alchemist](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1136066/Wing-Zero-Alchemist): Idk if Asuka's elbows being sharp are a reference to the Rebuilds, but it stuck out and amused me. Interesting detail on how the LCL in the Evas would freeze. The Eva are living things, so you'd think that the body temperature of the Eva would keep the entry plug warm. But the cold happens in Leliel too, so I guess not. Eva are considered "human" by the series definition, so you'd think they'd be warmblooded. .  
我不确定明日香肘部锋利是否是对《Rebuilds》的引用，但这点让我印象深刻并感到有趣。关于 EVA 中 LCL 会冻结的细节很有意思。EVA 是生物，按理说它们的体温应该能让插入栓保持温暖。但在雷利尔中也发生了寒冷现象，所以可能并非如此。根据系列的定义，EVA 被视为“人类”，按理说它们应该是温血动物。  
  
I'm envious of how you were able to come up with a new Angel. I've been struggling hard with that, tbh. The idea of going around the world to stop them is pretty neat. I know it's not inspired by ANIMA, but that was one of the good ideas we got from that, and I'm happy you proved it.  
我真的很羡慕你能构思出一个新天使。说实话，我在这方面一直很费劲。环游世界去阻止他们的想法非常巧妙。我知道这并非受 ANIMA 的启发，但那是我们从那儿获得的一个好点子，我很高兴你证实了这一点。  
  
No surprise Rei was alright. Probably just hibernated. Disappointed the Eva didn't have snowboards or something. Seems like bad planning on whoever designs the equipment. Or flamethrowers, that'd probably help.  
雷安然无恙并不出人意料，大概只是进入了冬眠状态。令人失望的是，Eva 竟然没有配备滑雪板之类的装备，这显然是设计者考虑不周。或者配备喷火器，那或许会更有用。  
  
Yeah, I got nothing. Sorry, Zoomfie, I tried but I couldn't even think of a shitpost for this one. It was really good, but I couldn't find anything to build a joke on. Congrats again on winning.  
唉，我真是无计可施了。抱歉，Zoomfie，我尽力了，但就是想不出什么搞笑的内容。虽然真的很不错，可我就是找不到能拿来开玩笑的点子。再次祝贺你赢得胜利。

[YourBlandestNightmare](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/13453602/YourBlandestNightmare): First of all, nice AU scenario you've cooked here. Different, but not too much.  
首先，你创作的这个 AU 场景很棒。有新意，但又不至于太偏离。  
  
Your description of the blizzard and of their state inside the improvised shelter were very good. I could feel their uncomfortableness, I got shivers imagining the frozen LCL in my own hair. Although that might also be because it's already pretty cold here xD  
你对暴风雪的描绘以及他们在简陋避难所中的境况描述得非常到位。我能深切体会到他们的不适，想象自己头发中冻结的 LCL 让我不禁打了个冷颤。或许也因为这里本身就很冷吧，哈哈。  
  
Loved how they dried each other's hair, it was beautiful.  
他们互相吹干对方的头发，这一幕真是美极了。  
  
But the sleeping scene before the ending was the best part. The buildup to that moment was very well done, with their canon conversation now repurposed for this new scene, except now they dare to go a little bit further and learn more from each other. And those forehead kisses by the end were masterfully described and adorable. I love it!  
但在结局前的睡眠场景无疑是最好的部分。到那一刻的铺垫处理得非常出色，他们原本的对话现在被巧妙地用于这个新场景，只是现在他们敢于更进一步，从彼此身上学到更多。而最后那些额头吻被描述得既精彩又可爱，令人喜爱不已。我非常喜欢！  
  
Thanks for writing, and congrats on winning! You earned it!  
感谢您的来信，并祝贺您赢得胜利！这是您努力的结果！

**Bubbles**: It shames me to admit this but I slept on this fic back then because the title weirded me out. I was pretty short on time(don't even remember what made me so busy) so I just skipped this fic with a weird, weird title. Because of that, I correctly called the other two winners but failed to predict the actual first-place winner.  
我承认，当时因为标题的怪异让我感到羞愧，没有去阅读这篇小说。那段时间我非常忙碌，具体原因已经记不清了，只是匆匆略过了这篇标题奇特的作品。结果，我准确地猜中了另外两位获奖者，却未能预料到最终夺冠的那篇。  
  
After the announcement, I read this fic finally and I realized I've made a mistake. This story did deserve the place.  
宣布之后，我终于读了这篇小说，意识到自己之前的判断有误。这个故事确实名副其实，值得那个位置。  
  
You made a bold choice here. AU where pilots have to move around the world to fight angels, a slightly tweaked Sahaquiel fight that happens near Antarctica. Under a restriction of strict word counts many writers wouldn't have bothered with setting up such a new background. You did, and did so efficiently. Lead-up to the fight and the fight scene itself are all written well to set up the main dish. It takes a good writer to utilize a few words to concisely tell what they want to tell. Any poorly trained rando could write a meandering grand epic that goes nowhere. It happens so often in the fanfiction scene. With about 3000 words you set up this new world and the tone of the story very well.  
你在此处展现了一个大胆的创意。在这个 AU 设定中，飞行员需环游全球以对抗天使，其中对南极洲附近发生的萨拉基尔之战进行了微调。面对严格的字数限制，许多作者或许会放弃构建如此新颖的背景。但你不仅做到了，还高效地完成了这一任务。战斗前的铺垫与战斗本身均被巧妙地书写，为故事的高潮做好了充分的准备。真正优秀的作者能够用简洁的文字精准传达意图，而缺乏训练的普通作者则往往创作出冗长且无明确方向的作品，这在同人小说领域颇为常见。你仅用约 3000 字便成功地塑造了这个新世界及故事的整体氛围。  
  
And of course, the main dish. I liked how intimate the whole thing was, albeit low-key. Not even the hugging thing; the whole hair stuff was very intimate, although it flew over Shinji's head completely.  
当然，主菜也是不可或缺的。整个过程虽然低调，却充满了亲密感，让我颇为喜欢。尤其是关于头发的那部分，虽然真嗣完全没意识到，却更显亲密。  
  
One more thing I'd like to comment about the story is that I like the way it feels it could be fitted into the canon storyline without too much problem. Your other fics had that vibe too and I love it.  
关于这个故事，我想补充的是，我很欣赏它能够自然地融入正史故事线，没有太多违和感。你的其他同人文也有这种特质，我非常喜欢。
