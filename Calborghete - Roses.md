"Why did Miss Misato tell me to do something like this?" Shinji spoke as he felt his hands trembling with the particular day, the day of a tribute for women in the school.  
“为什么 Misato 小姐要我做这种事？” 真嗣说道，他的双手因特定的日子——学校为女性举行的纪念日——而颤抖。

Yui took the plate in front of Shinji, she could see the nervousness on her son's face, with a smile he waited.  
优衣将盘子递到真嗣面前，她能看出儿子脸上的紧张，他微笑着等待。

Shinji felt nervous about putting his plan into practice, he looked again at his mother in the kitchen preparing something, clasping her hands tightly together, he asked for the thousandth time.  
真嗣对实施自己的计划感到紧张，他再次望向厨房里正在准备什么的母亲，双手紧握，他第无数次问道。

"Mom, isn't it a shameful thing to do that?" Asked the boy as he felt his hands sweating.  
“妈妈，做那件事不丢人吗？”男孩问道，感到手心出汗。

Yui turned and looked at Shinji with loving eyes, she could see her son's nervousness, but he couldn't be afraid to interact with women forever, but his face kept his best smile, drying his hands she spoke.  
优衣转过身，用充满爱意的眼神看着真嗣，她能看出儿子的紧张，但他不能永远害怕与女性交流，尽管他的脸上保持着最好的微笑，擦干双手后她说道。

"Your plan is a beautiful tribute to women, I don't know why you are so nervous." Says the woman with fake naivete, she could see her son's nervousness, but she did her best to hide it.  
“你的计划是对女性的美好致敬，我不知道你为什么这么紧张。”这位假装天真的女士说道，她能看出儿子的紧张，但她尽力掩饰。

"I... I know that, it's just that kind of thing isn't for me, I'm not like that." Shinji began to panic with his imagination, he saw the worst case scenarios he could.  
“我...我知道，只是那种事情不适合我，我不像那样。”真嗣开始因想象而恐慌，他设想了最糟糕的情况。

Taking steps towards her son, she took him in a tight hug, gave him a kiss on the top of his head to give him comfort.  
她向儿子走去，紧紧地拥抱了他，在他头顶上亲了一下，给予他安慰。

"Stop it, there is no big deal about doing this tribute, teacher Misato was right to give you this assignment, think you had students who were left with much worse things to do, the girls will love receiving the roses." Yui speaks smiling as she hugs her son even tighter.  
“别这样，做这个致敬没什么大不了的，Misato 老师让你做这个作业是对的，想想有些学生还得做更糟糕的事呢，女孩们收到玫瑰会很开心的。”Yui 笑着说，更紧地抱住了儿子。

Shinji felt calmer, but was anxious about his task.  
真嗣感到平静了些，但对自己的任务仍感到焦虑。

"But Miss Misato loves to tease me, she will make my life a living hell." Says the man afraid for his future, Misato spared no effort in teasing him, but they had a good relationship.  
“但美里小姐喜欢捉弄我，她会让我生活在水深火热之中。”男子对未来充满恐惧地说道，美里不遗余力地捉弄他，但他们关系很好。

"She's playing with you, she wants you to be a more open person, you can't keep running away from people forever Shinji, one day you're going to have to face your fears."  
“她在逗你玩呢，她希望你能变得更开朗，你不能永远逃避与人交往，总有一天你得面对自己的恐惧。”

Yui walked away, but kept his arms around his shoulders at all times, his gaze serious.  
Yui 走开了，但始终将手臂搭在他的肩膀上，目光严肃。

"Face it like a man Shinji."  
"像个男人一样面对它，真嗣。"

The boy felt tiny under his mother's gaze, with a long sigh he clenched his hands tighter, he felt a determination taking over his body, he was anxious, but at least he was going to make it, next to him was the package with the roses he was going to give to the girls.  
男孩在母亲的注视下感到自己渺小无比，他长叹一声，双手握得更紧了，一种决心逐渐占据了他的身体，他虽焦虑，但至少决心要完成任务，在他身旁是装着玫瑰的包裹，那是他打算送给女孩们的。

He nodded at those words, Shinji took a deep breath as he closed his eyes, Yui walked away as she finished preparing lunches for her children.  
他点头回应这些话，真嗣闭上眼睛深吸了一口气，Yui 完成了为孩子们准备午餐后走开了。

"You took Asuka's?" "你拿了明日香的？"

Shinji's eyes widened as he heard the name of his oldest friend, again panicked, he spoke nervously.  
听到最老朋友的名字，真嗣的眼睛睁大了，再次陷入慌乱，他紧张地开口。

"Yes...but I don't know if I'll give it to her."  
"是的……但我不知道会不会还给她。"

"Why not?" Asked Yui doubtfully, he would give a rose to every girl but his best friend, that didn't seem right to his watchful eyes.  
"为什么不呢？" 由依疑惑地问道，他会给每个女孩送玫瑰，却唯独不给他最好的朋友，这在他的细心观察下似乎不太对劲。

"I don't want her to think I'm a sucker, she already laughs at everything I do, calls me baka all the time." Shinji speaks dejected as he remembers his friend, he wanted to have one more thing with her, but a man like him never stays with a woman like Asuka, she only likes popular people and he was not one of them.  
"我不想让她觉得我是个傻瓜，她已经对我做的每件事都嘲笑，还总是叫我笨蛋。" 真嗣沮丧地说着，回忆起他的朋友，他希望能和她多一些联系，但像他这样的男人永远留不住像明日香那样的女人，她只喜欢受欢迎的人，而他不是其中之一。

"But she'll be upset about being left out." Says Yui sad to think about it, she knew how Asuka felt about Shinji, but she couldn't tell her son anything, he had to take on this part, he had to see it.  
"但被排除在外她会难过的。" 由依悲伤地说道，她知道明日香对真嗣的感觉，但她不能告诉她的儿子任何事情，他必须自己去面对这一部分，他必须看清楚。

"You're finding things again." Says Yui getting slightly annoyed.  
"你又在找东西了。" 优有些恼怒地说道。

"It's not that, I just don't want to destroy what we have with a misunderstanding." Says Shinji as he defends himself, but deep down he knew that Asuka would never take it well being left out, with a hand to his face he thought.  
"不是那样的，我只是不想因为误会而破坏我们之间的关系。" 真嗣为自己辩解道，但内心深处他知道，明日香被排除在外的话，她肯定不会善罢甘休。他用手扶着脸，陷入了沉思。

"She's my oldest friend, and I don't want others to think the wrong things." Shinji spoke dejectedly as he remembered all the teasing he was receiving from his classmates.  
"她是我最老的朋友，我不想让别人误会。" 真嗣沮丧地说着，回想起同学们对他的那些嘲弄。

Yui wanted to speak more, but quickly beside her came Rei, her daughter with a bored look on her face, she wanted to be in school now.  
优想再多说几句，但很快她身边出现了丽，她的女儿，脸上带着无聊的表情，她现在就想待在学校。

"We have to go! I don't want to be late because of you!" Rei gathered herself beside her, she was a shy girl, but at home she had the same genius as her mother, she had the perfect school attendance record and didn't want to lose her awards because of it.  
“我们得走了！我不想因为你而迟到！”丽在她身边整理自己，她是个害羞的女孩，但在家里她和她母亲一样聪明，她有着完美的出勤记录，不想因此失去她的奖项。

"MOTHER! Where are the buns?" Asked the girl as she looked for her assignment, soon Yui approached with a bag, in it containing some snacks for the class.  
“妈妈！包子在哪里？”女孩一边寻找她的作业，一边问道，很快优拿着一个袋子走过来，里面装着给班级的零食。

"Come on Shinji!" “快点，真嗣！”

"I know Rei, give me a minute." Says Shinji as he reaches for a glass of orange juice, he felt his hand shaking with the scenarios going through his mind.  
“我知道了，绫波，再给我一分钟。”真嗣说着伸手去拿一杯橙汁，他感到自己的手因脑海中闪过的种种情景而颤抖。

CAMPAIGN 战役

Shinji jumped when he heard this, feeling his anxiety increasing even more with the person on the other side of the door, he ran to his room to hide the roses in his backpack so Asuka wouldn't see them.  
听到这话，真嗣吓了一跳，门外那人的存在让他的焦虑愈发加剧，他跑回房间，把玫瑰花藏进背包里，以免明日香看到。

"Don't forget to get the chocolates too." Says Yui smiling as she saw her son running to hide the bag, she went back to her coffee as she saw Rei heading towards the door, she already knew it was Asuka, just like every morning.  
“别忘了还要买巧克力。” 绫微笑着说，看着儿子跑去藏包，她回到咖啡旁，看到丽朝门口走去，她早已知道是明日香，就像每个早晨一样。

"Hi Soryu." Says Rei with antipathy upon seeing Asuka, both had their differences.  
“你好，惣流。” 丽带着厌恶地说，看到明日香，两人之间总是有些分歧。

"Hey doll, ready to pull the teachers bag again?" Says Asuka with venom as she passes Rei, she wanted to pick up Shinji and take him to school, as usual he was late and it annoyed her.  
"嘿，宝贝，准备好再次拖老师后腿了吗？" 明日香带着毒舌从丽身边走过，她本想像往常一样接真嗣去学校，但他又迟到了，这让她很恼火。

Rei turned around as she scowled, heading in the direction of the invader she spoke angrily.  
丽转过身，皱着眉头，朝着入侵者的方向走去，语气中带着愤怒。

"I am not a doll! I only think about my future!"  
"我不是玩偶！我只考虑我的未来！"

"Okay okay okay." Says Asuka as she gestures with her hands, her sharp blue eyes were searching for her lazy baka.  
“好好好。”明日香一边说着，一边用手势比划，她那锐利的蓝眼睛四处寻找着她那懒散的笨蛋。

Yui heard the small scuffle at her door, she knew that Asuka had provoked Rei and was generating a fight, with a long sigh she watched Asuka enter.  
Yui 听到门口传来轻微的骚动声，她知道是明日香挑衅了丽，正在制造一场争执。她长叹一声，看着明日香走了进来。

"Good morning Aunt Yui." Says Asuka with her best smile on her face, just further back Rei came up with a deadly look on her face, not liking how she was ignored.  
“早上好，Yui 阿姨。”明日香脸上挂着她最灿烂的笑容说道，而在她身后，丽带着一脸致命的表情走了过来，显然不喜欢自己被忽视的感觉。

"Good morning Asuka... Shinji is finished changing." Said the woman calmly as she sat down in one of the kitchen chairs, watching as Asuka and Rei exchanged deadly glances in her home.  
"早上好，Asuka... Shinji 已经换好衣服了。" 女人平静地说道，她坐在厨房的一张椅子上，看着 Asuka 和 Rei 在她家中交换着致命的目光。

"Girls please, it's too early to fight."  
"女孩们，请别这样，现在还太早了，别吵架。"

"I'm not fighting with her, Rei is the one who is mad, she must be on her period." Says Asuka as she stayed still in her disdainful mode, Yui rolled her eyes upon hearing this, she loved Asuka as her own daughter, but this genius bothered her a lot, she was really Kyoko's daughter, same stubborn and poisonous personality.  
"我才没和她打架，是 Rei 在生气，她肯定是来月经了。" Asuka 保持着她那不屑一顾的态度说道，听到这话的 Yui 翻了个白眼，她把 Asuka 当作自己的女儿一样疼爱，但这个天才少女常常让她感到困扰，她真是 Kyoko 的女儿，同样的固执和毒舌性格。

"I'M NOT MENSTRUATING!" growled Rei again, but Yui's gaze quickly shut her up, she made it clear that she didn't want fighting in her home.  
"我不是在月经！" 丽再次咆哮道，但唯的目光迅速让她闭嘴，她明确表示不希望在自己家里发生争执。

"How does the goofy nerd put up with you?" Grumbles the redhead as she remembers the little romance that the two of them experience, still not understanding how they matched up.  
"那个傻乎乎的书呆子怎么受得了你？" 红发女孩嘟囔着，回想起两人经历的那段小浪漫，仍然不明白他们是怎么凑到一起的。

"Kenken is not a goof! He cares about his future, just like me!" Rei retorts angrily upon hearing Asuka offending her close friend.  
"健健才不傻！他关心自己的未来，就像我一样！" 丽听到明日香冒犯她的好友，生气地反驳道。

"Well..." Said Asuka as she ran her hand through her beautiful red hair, she felt victorious at this moment, she looked at the clock on her wrist as she saw that they were running out of time, with a long sigh she asked Yui.  
“嗯……”明日香一边说着，一边用手梳理着她那美丽的红色长发，此刻她感到胜利在望。她看了看手腕上的时钟，发现时间所剩无几，长叹一声后问向唯。

"Where is Baka-Shinji ?" “笨蛋真嗣在哪儿？”

Yui smiled as she heard this, the redhead already knew where he would be at this point, but still wondered out of respect for Yui.  
唯听到这话笑了，红发少女早已知道他此刻会在哪里，但出于对唯的尊重，她还是问了出来。

"It's in your room." Says Yui as she points in the direction of the room, with a smile the redhead walked off towards her target, she knew about Shinji's plan to give a rose to all the women in the class, all thanks to Miss Misato, in the back of her mind she was anxious to see how Shinji would approach the girls to give the gift, especially what he would say to her.  
"在你的房间里。" 优衣指着房间的方向说道，脸上带着微笑，红发女孩朝着目标走去。她知道真嗣打算给班上所有女生送玫瑰花的计划，这都多亏了美里小姐。在她心底，她急切地想知道真嗣会如何接近女生们送礼物，尤其是他会对她说些什么。

Stopping in front of the door, she wasted no time in opening it, she saw Shinji quickly hiding something in his backpack, she spoke with a provocative smile.  
她停在门前，毫不犹豫地推开门，看到真嗣迅速将某物藏进背包里，她带着挑逗的微笑开口。

"ASUKA!" Says Shinji nervously hiding the roses, he was annoyed that she didn't respect the private space of his room, but he was getting used to it.  
"明日香！" 真嗣紧张地藏起玫瑰花，他对她不尊重自己房间的私人空间感到恼火，但他已经习惯了。

"What are you hiding?" Says the redhead standing in the doorway with her smile still present.  
"你在藏什么？" 红发女孩站在门口，笑容依旧挂在脸上。

"They were dirty magazines, I knew you were a pervert."  
"是些色情杂志，我就知道你是个变态。"

"I'm not!" Says Shinji as he picks up his backpack, his face was upset at the thought of this accusation he was receiving, he was not a pervert, just a normal fourteen year old boy.  
"我不是！" 真嗣边说边捡起书包，一想到这个指控，他的脸上满是沮丧，他不是变态，只是一个普通的十四岁男孩。

"I know." Says Asuka skeptically, but she soon remembered her goal on this particular visit.  
"我知道。" 明日香怀疑地说，但她很快记起了这次特定拜访的目标。

"We have to go pervert, if we're not going to be late." Says the redhead as she leaves the room, but her face still with a smile, her mind thinking about how she was going to react in receiving her rose.  
"我们得走了，变态，不然就要迟到了。" 红发女孩说着离开了房间，但脸上依然带着微笑，心里想着收到玫瑰时该如何反应。

"I'm not a pervert!" Shinji shouted as he went after his friend, but Asuka's laughter would not listen to him.  
"我不是变态！" 真嗣喊着追上他的朋友，但明日香的笑声却无视了他的辩解。

Before leaving the house, Yui stopped her son by whispering in his ear, Rei was standing next to Asuka with a hurried look on her face.  
在离开家之前，Yui 轻声在儿子耳边停下，丽站在明日香旁边，脸上带着急切的神情。

"It will be all right you'll see."  
“一切都会好起来的，你会看到的。”

Shinji smiled at his mother's words, he felt more secure with this, but the nervousness was still present in his heart and soul, he just wanted this all to end, he just wanted to be able to enjoy his youth, but it seemed that the world had something against him.  
真嗣对母亲的话报以微笑，这让他感到更安心，但紧张感依旧萦绕在他的心间，他只希望这一切能结束，只想享受他的青春，但似乎世界对他有所不公。

So the trio started off to school, Asuka was chattering away to Rei about women's issues, but Shinji was in his own world, every step he took towards school was another step towards total embarrassment, but he had made a promise to himself, he would get through this.  
于是三人动身前往学校，明日香正喋喋不休地向绫波丽谈论女性话题，但真嗣沉浸在自己的世界里，每向学校迈进一步，就意味着离彻底的尴尬更近一步，但他已向自己许下承诺，他会挺过去的。

Soon his eyes fell on Asuka, seeing how the wind was swaying her beautiful red hair like a waterfall of shiny copper, he doesn't know when these feelings started to arise, but they were there. Damn hormones, thought the boy becoming irritated.  
很快，他的目光落在了明日香身上，看着风如何像摆动闪亮的铜色瀑布一样摆动她美丽的红色长发，他不知道这些感觉何时开始萌生，但它们确实存在。该死的荷尔蒙，男孩烦躁地想。

Shinji soon thought of his own quiet personality, he was like his father, a lonely man, he stopped in his darkest thoughts, he was not popular, not tall or muscular, unlike how Asuka described "real men", so why would she look at a person like him?  
真嗣很快想到了自己内向的性格，他像他父亲一样，是个孤独的人，他在最阴暗的思绪中停下脚步，他不受欢迎，不高大也不健壮，不像明日香描述的“真正的男人”，那么她为何会看上他这样的人呢？

Asuka noticed Shinji looking at her, she could see the boy turning his face away, but the downcast look remained on his face, why couldn't he trust her like they did before? Why didn't he seek her out like before? Did he not like her anymore? This thought hurt her, she never thought of her life without Shinji, many nights she caught herself thinking about her future, and Shinji was always there.  
明日香注意到真嗣在看她，她能看到男孩转过脸去，但脸上的沮丧依旧，为什么他不能再像以前那样信任她？为什么他不像以前那样来找她？他不再喜欢她了吗？这个想法让她心痛，她从未想过没有真嗣的生活，许多夜晚她发现自己思考着未来，而真嗣总是在那里。

He remembered when they were children, against all odds they became friends, two completely different people, but fate brought them together in a strong way.  
他记得他们还是孩子的时候，尽管困难重重，他们成为了朋友，两个完全不同的人，但命运以一种强烈的方式将他们联系在一起。

She felt her face blushing slightly, but she didn't care about that, her eyes were still on Shinji, why wasn't he complimenting her? Why didn't he look at her like he looked at the other girls? Was she not pretty? Did he think she was ugly? This was lingering longer in his mind.  
她感到自己的脸颊微微泛红，但她并不在意，她的目光依旧停留在真嗣身上，为什么他不赞美她？为什么他不像看其他女孩那样看她？她不漂亮吗？他认为她丑吗？这个念头在他脑海中挥之不去。

"_Don't you think I ever caught you looking at other girls at school?"_ Thought the redhead as she felt a bad feeling off her chest, why wasn't he looking at her? That was a question she never answered, many times she caught herself looking in the mirror looking for imperfections in his face, anything he didn't like.  
"难道你以为我没发现你在学校里偷看其他女孩吗？"红发女孩心中暗想，她感到胸口一阵不适，为什么他不再看她了？这个问题她从未找到答案，许多次她对着镜子审视自己的脸庞，寻找任何他可能不喜欢的瑕疵。

She blinked as she returned to the real world, Asuka would not pay attention to such a thing, she was waiting for the big event that would happen at the school, it would give her the warmth in her chest that she had been waiting for, it was just waiting, that's all, with that in mind she started walking with proud steps towards the school, a smile was born on her face with the fantasies that her mind could make.  
她眨了眨眼，回到了现实世界，明日香不会在意这种小事，她在等待学校即将发生的大事件，那将给她带来久违的胸中温暖，只是等待而已，仅此而已。想到这里，她带着自豪的步伐走向学校，脸上绽放出笑容，脑海中幻想着种种可能。

Rei always saw herself as a more observant person, something she surely inherited from her father, she looked over to see Asuka looking at Shinji with every step, she knew what was going on in Shinji and Asuka's mind right now, why didn't the two of them talk like normal people? The red-eyed girl thought calmly, she remembered the conversations between Shinji and his mother, she heard everything, especially how Shinji belittled himself in front of other people, he might be an ordinary guy, but he had some good masculine attributes.  
丽总觉得自己是个更善于观察的人，这一点她肯定是从父亲那里继承来的。她瞥了一眼，看到明日香每走一步都在注视着真嗣，她知道此刻真嗣和明日香心里在想什么，为什么他们俩不能像正常人一样交流呢？红眼女孩平静地想道，她记得真嗣和他母亲的对话，她听到了一切，尤其是真嗣在别人面前如何贬低自己，他可能是个普通男孩，但他也有一些不错的男子气概。

His lack of self-esteem always kept him from seeing the world as it really was, many girls wanted to approach him at school, but his cold personality kept them away, and Asuka always kept them away by saying things about him, she was always very possessive about their friendship, but they both never took the next step.  
他缺乏自信总是让他无法看清世界的真实面貌，学校里许多女孩都想接近他，但他冷漠的性格让她们望而却步，而明日香总是通过说他的坏话来赶走她们，她对他们的友谊总是非常占有欲强，但他们俩从未迈出下一步。

With that said, the trio continued on their way to school, with each in their own personal and private worlds, with their own fears and narratives to support, only time would tell how things would be in the future.  
话虽如此，三人继续前往学校的路上，各自沉浸在自己的个人和私密世界中，带着各自的恐惧和故事支撑，只有时间能告诉我们未来会如何。

Finally at school Shinji paid no attention to class, his mind only thinking of the moment when he would have to face his greatest fear, the most shameful moment of his life, soon the sound of the bell revealed the change of classes, he looked up to see Misato entering the classroom smiling, the other students were drooling over the beautiful teacher.  
终于到了学校，真嗣对课堂内容置若罔闻，满脑子都是即将面对自己最大恐惧、人生中最羞耻的时刻。不久，铃声响起，预示着课间的转换，他抬头看见美里笑着走进教室，其他学生则对这位美丽的老师垂涎三尺。

"Hello dear students, how is everyone?" Asked the woman with a smile on her face, she loves her job, she loved teaching and making the future for these young people, soon her eyes fell on Shinji, her protégé within this room, but she never let it show.  
“亲爱的同学们，大家好吗？”女教师面带微笑问道，她热爱自己的工作，喜欢教书育人，为这些年轻人的未来铺路。很快，她的目光落在了真嗣身上，她是他在教室里的导师，但她从不表露出来。

"Rise... bow... sit." Says Hikari with her strong authority, she took her work in the classroom seriously, Misato didn't care about such things, she believed that the classroom had to be a free environment for students to express themselves in any way they want, not with the old ways.  
“起立...鞠躬...坐下。”光用她那坚定的权威说道，她对待教室里的工作非常认真。美里则不太在意这些形式，她认为教室应该是一个自由的环境，让学生们以任何他们想要的方式表达自己，而不是遵循旧的传统。

"All right listen up everyone." Said the woman as she clapped her hands together, smiling as she saw that the students respected her.  
“好了，大家注意听。”女子拍了拍手说道，微笑着看到学生们对她表示尊敬。

"Today is the day of the special event, next week is the other half of the class, shall we start with our little breakfast?" asked the woman with a smile as she focused on the duo Hikari and Toji and Rei and Kensuke.  
“今天是我们特别活动的日子，下周是另一半课程，我们先从早餐开始怎么样？”女子微笑着问道，目光集中在光和真嗣以及丽和健介身上。

Blushing hard at this, Toji stood up as he picked up some bags, inside them some bread and chocolate milk that he had prepared for the class, he gathered the things on his table, he asked everyone, soon his eyes fell on Hikari, the person who had helped him prepare all this, but Misato didn't need to know that.  
真嗣听到这话，脸红得厉害，他站起来拿起几个袋子，里面装着他为班级准备的面包和巧克力牛奶，他把东西整理在桌上，问大家，很快他的目光落在了光身上，那个帮他准备这一切的人，但美里不需要知道这些。

"I hope you like it, I made hot chocolate and some rolls." Said the boy embarrassedly as he saw Misato approaching his table, he thought he might impress his teacher.  
"希望你会喜欢，我做了热巧克力和一些面包卷。" 男孩尴尬地说道，当他看到美里走近他的桌子时，他以为自己可能会给老师留下好印象。

Grabbing a cup and a small loaf of bread, Misato wasted no time in starting to enjoy a good breakfast, even though it had a simple homemade touch, this was better than a beer or microwave food.  
美里拿起一杯热巧克力和一小块面包，毫不犹豫地开始享受一顿美味的早餐，尽管这顿早餐简单朴素，但这比啤酒或微波食品要好得多。

"That's good, you can attack guys!" Said the woman as she returned to her table, Toji smiled knowing that at least they had managed to get something right in this challenge from Misato. Soon Hikari approached as she grabbed a glass, her gaze focused on Toji the whole time.  
"那很好，你可以攻击那些家伙！" 女人说着回到自己的桌子旁，冬二微笑着，至少在这场美里发起的挑战中，他们总算做对了一件事。很快，光也走了过来，拿起一个杯子，她的目光始终集中在冬二身上。

"Aren't you going to thank me?" Said the girl as she remembered doing all the work in her house, even preparing lots of chocolate and cake for everyone without much help from Toji.  
“你难道不打算谢谢我吗？”女孩说道，她记得在家里做了所有的工作，甚至为每个人准备了许多巧克力和蛋糕，几乎没有得到真嗣的帮助。

"Well... you know... it was... it was nice." Dismissing this Toji with embarrassment, he quickly went back to serving his friends to escape the fiery look Hikari was giving him, beside him Kensuke was helping Rei prepare the snacks, unlike the previous two, they made an efficient duo, exchanging smiles from time to time.  
“嗯……你知道的……这挺……挺好的。”真嗣尴尬地打发着，迅速回到为朋友们服务，以逃避光对他投来的炽热目光。在他旁边，健介正在帮助丽准备小吃，与前两人不同，他们是一对高效搭档，时不时交换着微笑。

Shinji sat down in his chair, in his hands a small glass with the snack, but he felt his stomach churning with what he had to do, soon his eyes fell on Asuka talking to the other girls, he thought about how pathetic she must find him, this challenge from Misato would only prove it.  
真嗣坐在椅子上，手里拿着一小杯零食，但他感到胃里一阵翻腾，因为他必须做的事情。很快，他的目光落在了与女孩们交谈的明日香身上，他想知道她一定觉得他有多么可悲，美里提出的这个挑战只会证明这一点。

The class quickly exchanged conversations as the moment ended, Shinji felt his heart getting even heavier with the ticking of the clock, soon Misato started talking again, his social death was getting closer and closer.  
随着那一刻的结束，班级里迅速交换着对话，真嗣感到自己的心情随着时钟的滴答声愈发沉重，不久后美里再次开口，他的社交死亡正一步步逼近。

"Okay class, what grade can we give to the pairs who worked so hard to provide this nice snack for all of us?" Misato asked smiling.  
“好了，同学们，对于那些辛勤为我们准备美味小吃的搭档们，我们应该给他们打多少分呢？”美里微笑着问道。

"Zero." Said one boy as he got people's laughter, but they all quickly fell silent at Misato's deadly stare, she might be tolerant, but she didn't take stupid jokes in her class.  
“零分。”一个男孩说道，引来了众人的笑声，但在美里那致命的目光下，他们很快又安静了下来，她或许宽容，但绝不容忍课堂上的愚蠢玩笑。

"I'm serious!" "我是认真的！"

"I would give ten... Nine... eight and a half." Some random girl in the room began to speak, just as everyone began to give their notes, Misato smiled as she spoke again.  
"我会给十分...九分...八分半。" 房间里一个随意的女孩开始说话，就在大家开始打分时，美里微笑着再次开口。

"Let's close in nine and a half." She said as she clapped her hands together. "Congratulations to those involved."  
"让我们定在九分半吧。" 她一边说一边拍手。"恭喜所有相关人员。"

Shinji felt like he was going to throw up at this moment, his anxiety was running a thousand per hour, the roses in his backpack weighing more than a ton, Asuka looked at him to see his nervousness, she felt sorry for Shinji at this, but she cannot deny her own anxiety to receive her rose and chocolate, with a smile she waited.  
此时，真嗣感觉自己快要吐了，他的焦虑如千马奔腾，背包里的玫瑰重如千钧，明日香看着他紧张的样子，心中不禁为真嗣感到难过，但她也无法否认自己收到玫瑰和巧克力的紧张心情，她带着微笑等待着。

Misato quickly looked at Shinji, she knew that the boy had to face his fears one day, especially when it came to girls, with a smile she began to speak.  
美里迅速看了真嗣一眼，她知道这个男孩总有一天要面对自己的恐惧，尤其是在女孩子面前，她带着微笑开始说话。

"Now it is time for Shinji Ikari to present the tribute to the girls." Misato says as he walks towards the boy, his face smiling all the while.  
“现在轮到真嗣·碇向女孩们献礼了。”美里说着走向男孩，脸上始终挂着笑容。

"UH!" The girls spoke teasingly, but the girls quickly blushed at this, Misato always came up with the craziest ideas and this was another one, only Asuka was smiling.  
"哎呀！" 女孩们打趣地说道，但很快她们就脸红了，美里总是能想出最疯狂的主意，这次也不例外，只有明日香在微笑。

"So Shinji, what have you prepared for our beautiful girls?" Misato says as she puts her hands together in front of her body, looking forward to the moment.  
"那么，真嗣，你为我们美丽的女孩们准备了什么？" 美里说着，双手合十放在胸前，期待着那一刻的到来。

Shinji felt the sweat dripping down his body, he swallowed dryly as he stood up, beside him the bags containing the roses with the duly prepared chocolates.  
真嗣感到汗水顺着身体滴落，他干咽了一口，站起身来，身旁是装着玫瑰和精心准备的巧克力的袋子。

"I... I prepared that." Said the boy as he removed one of the roses with a candy attached, Misato smiled at that, it was a simple but effective gift, what woman doesn't like roses and chocolate.  
"我...我准备了那个。"男孩说着，取下一朵附有糖果的玫瑰，美里对此微笑，这是一个简单却有效的礼物，哪个女人不喜欢玫瑰和巧克力呢？

"Uh!" Says another boy as he laughs, but quickly another started talking.  
"呃！"另一个男孩笑着说，但很快另一个人开始说话了。

"Miss Misato, why does he have to do this tribute for women if today isn't even international women's day?" Asked Toji as he felt sorry for Shinji, he as his closest friend did not like the laughter of the class.  
"美里小姐，既然今天不是国际妇女节，他为什么要为女性做这个致敬呢？" 问话的是冬二，他作为真嗣最亲近的朋友，不喜欢班上的笑声。

"SUZUHARA!" Shouted Hikari as she felt angry, she was more conservative and gifting women never went out of style.  
"铃原！" 光愤怒地喊道，她更为保守，认为向女性赠送礼物永远不会过时。

"There's no date to praise a woman or do a tribute, next week it's the girls' turn to do that." Says Misato as she put her arm on Shinji's shoulder, she was giving him full support.  
"没有特定日期来赞美女性或进行致敬，下周轮到女孩们来做这件事了。" 美里说着，将手臂搭在真嗣的肩膀上，她给予他全力的支持。

"This exercise is to show that we should not fixate ourselves to fixed dates or events, if we feel the need to honor someone, we have to do it anytime."  
"这个练习是为了表明我们不应拘泥于固定的日期或事件，如果我们觉得有必要向某人致敬，我们应该随时去做。"

With that said, Misato watched as the men fell silent and the girls stood in anticipation, all wanting to receive their rose and chocolate, Asuka in particular had a silly smile on her face. Shinji cringed at this, Misato tried to change the mood of the room, stopping beside the boy, she pointed to the class.  
话音刚落，美里看着男人们陷入沉默，女孩们则满怀期待地站着，每个人都渴望收到玫瑰和巧克力，尤其是明日香，脸上挂着傻乎乎的笑容。这让真嗣感到尴尬，美里试图改变房间的气氛，她走到男孩身边，指向教室。

Noticing the smile on Asuka's face, Shinji quickly thought about how she would be finding him pathetic, but Misato spoke up again as he analyzed the simple gift.  
注意到明日香脸上的笑容，真嗣迅速想到她会觉得自己很可悲，但美里再次开口，他在分析这份简单的礼物时。

"That's beautiful Shinji, you can distribute."  
“真嗣，这很漂亮，你可以分发给大家。”

Shinji nodded as he gave the first rose to Misato, who accepted it wholeheartedly, soon he started passing the tables, he felt his hands shaking as he handed the roses, many girls didn't care for the gift, others had a shy, blushing smile, this was all noticed by Asuka.  
真嗣点头后将第一朵玫瑰递给美里，她欣然接受，随后他开始逐桌分发，感到双手颤抖着递出玫瑰，许多女孩并不在意这份礼物，有些人则羞涩地微笑着，这一切都被明日香看在眼里。

"Thank you Shinji." Rei said as she feigned indifference, but the bottom line she liked it, Hikari had her best smile on her face with that, she smelled the rose as she let the scent flood her nostrils.  
“谢谢你，真嗣。”丽假装漠不关心地说，但她内心其实很喜欢，光子则露出了最灿烂的笑容，她闻着玫瑰，让香气充盈鼻腔。

"Thank you Ikari, that rose is beautiful." Spoke a random girl, Asuka lost her smile slightly at that, she didn't like how Shinji smiled at the small compliment, soon it was Asuka's turn in the row, just as the boy was getting closer, she felt her heart racing, the time is now.  
“谢谢你，碇君，这朵玫瑰真美。”一个陌生女孩说道，明日香听到后微微收起了笑容，她不喜欢真嗣对这小小赞美的微笑反应，很快轮到明日香了，就在男孩走近时，她感到心跳加速，时机已到。

Shinji noticed Asuka's table approaching, feeling his heart racing with the redhead's special gift, he looked inside his bag at her rose waiting, feeling a million situations running through his mind at this moment.  
真嗣注意到明日香正向他的桌子走来，心中因红发女孩的特别礼物而心跳加速，他瞥了一眼书包里她送的玫瑰，此刻脑海中闪过无数种情景。

"_She's going to hate me!"_ Thought the man as he imagined her laughing with the gift. _"I'm not her type! Everyone will laugh at me!"_  
“她一定会讨厌我！”男子想着，想象着她收到礼物时大笑的情景。“我不是她喜欢的类型！所有人都会嘲笑我！”

Asuka waited her turn as soon as Shinji approached, but one thing happened, she didn't get a rose, she looked at her friend's back doubtfully, she hoped he must have forgotten or been too nervous.  
明日香等待着轮到自己，当真嗣走近时，却发生了一件事——她没有收到玫瑰。她疑惑地看着朋友的背影，希望他只是忘记了或是太过紧张。

"_Doesn't he see me as a woman?"_ Thought the redhead as she saw Shinji walking away, she quickly lost her smile as she scowled, she felt like she was being betrayed, she stopped to think, who she was before the other girls in the room, she didn't have the best feminine attributes, she was a Japanese-European half-breed, how would Shinji look at her?  
"难道他不把我当女人看吗？" 红发女孩看着真嗣走开，笑容迅速消失，皱起了眉头，她感觉自己被背叛了，停下来思考，在房间里的其他女孩面前，她并没有最出色的女性特质，她是日欧混血，真嗣会怎么看她呢？

Feeling the sadness taking over her body, she quickly looked around to see if anyone had noticed this little mistake, she returned her attention to her computer and her notes, but her mind was sad.  
感受到悲伤侵袭全身，她迅速环顾四周，看看是否有人注意到这个小错误，她将注意力转回电脑和笔记上，但她的心却很悲伤。

Hikari looked at Shinji as she saw him passing all the girls except Asuka, she didn't understand why he did that, as did Misato and Rei, but the world had to keep turning, soon Shinji returned to his seat, but his head lowered and he didn't notice the looks he received from Misato and Hikari.  
光看着真嗣，见他绕过了所有女孩，除了明日香，她不明白他为什么这么做，美里和丽也一样，但世界还得继续运转，很快真嗣回到了座位，但他的头低垂着，没有注意到美里和光投来的目光。

With a long sigh Misato looked at the class, just like the previous one she asked.  
长叹一声，美里望向全班，就像之前她询问的那样。

"So class, what grade does he deserve with his tribute?"  
“那么同学们，你们觉得他的悼词该得什么分数呢？”

Shinji didn't even care about the note he received, he didn't even listen to the voices around him, he felt sad, sad for not being able to pay his respects to Asuka, sad for being a pathetic and weak person, he soon looked at Asuka's gift in his bag, she would never accept someone like him.  
真嗣连收到的评分都毫不在意，他甚至没去听周围的声音，只感到悲伤，为无法向明日香表达敬意而悲伤，为身为一个可怜又软弱的人而悲伤，他很快看向包里明日香的礼物，她永远不会接受像他这样的人。

He didn't notice Asuka's hurt look on his back, how upset she had been by this attitude, her heart bled for being left out by Shinji, how could he do such a thing to her? It stayed in her mind, her day had been destroyed.  
他没有注意到背后明日香受伤的眼神，她因这种态度而感到多么沮丧，她的心因为被真嗣排除在外而流血，他怎么能这样对她？这件事一直萦绕在她的脑海中，她的日子就这样被毁了。

---

Lunch had arrived, Shinji went up to the terrace to think about his pathetic life, sitting on the ground he thought about Asuka, his mind screaming at him to stop thinking about her, to stop being upset about an impossible dream.  
午餐时间到了，真嗣走上露台思考他那可悲的生活，坐在地上，他想起了明日香，他的内心尖叫着让他停止思考她，停止为一个不可能的梦想而烦恼。

"Shinji?" A female voice spoke behind him, jumping up with fright thinking it would be Asuka, the boy felt relieved to see Hikari with an attentive but disapproving look.  
“真嗣？”一个女声在他身后响起，他吓得跳了起来，以为是明日香，看到是带着关切但不满表情的光，男孩松了一口气。

"Hikari? What are you doing here? You usually eat in the classroom." Says Shinji as he tries to stay calm, but he felt that she would fight with him somehow, especially after Misato and Rei went to ask her to talk to Shinji.  
"光？你怎么在这里？你通常是在教室里吃饭的。" 真嗣尽量保持冷静地说道，但他感觉到她会以某种方式与他争执，尤其是在美里和丽去请她与真嗣谈谈之后。

Hikari swallowed dryly, she could see how sad Asuka had been with him for not receiving the tribute, she approached him and spoke directly.  
光咽了咽口水，她能看出明日香因为未得到赞誉而对真嗣有多么伤心，她走近他，直接开口说道。

"Why did you do that to Asuka?"  
"你为什么要那样对明日香？"

Shinji's eyes widened as he realized this, he thought he had managed to disguise it well but apparently not. Hikari looked at Shinji as she became angry, she knew Asuka well, she knew how she felt about the boy, this must have hurt the redhead a lot.  
意识到这一点，真嗣的眼睛瞪大了，他以为自己掩饰得很好，但显然并非如此。光看着真嗣，变得愤怒起来，她很了解明日香，知道她对这男孩的感情，这一定让红发女孩很受伤。

Shinji did not answer; he bowed his head in a sign of shame. Hikari quickly continued.  
真嗣没有回答；他低下头，表示羞愧。光迅速继续说道。

"You don't like her? Why did you ignore her like that?" Hikari spoke annoyed. Shinji didn't answer.  
“你不喜欢她吗？为什么那样无视她？”光不悦地说道。真嗣没有回答。

"Sometimes I think you are just another ordinary guy, I thought you would be different from those perverts, by the looks of it I thought wrong." Said the girl angrily, turning to leave the roof, Shinji began to speak dejectedly.  
"有时候我觉得你只是个普通男生，我以为你会和那些变态不一样，看来是我错了。" 女孩生气地说着，转身离开屋顶，真嗣开始沮丧地开口。

"I don't know why I did that." Hikari turned to Shinji again, she wanted to hear his apology.  
"我不知道我为什么会那样做。" 光转身再次面对真嗣，她想听到他的道歉。

"I don't want her to think anything wrong of me." Shinji began to speak. "I don't want others to think something wrong about me, I don't want...I don't want others to think wrong about the situation."  
"我不想让她对我有任何误解。" 真嗣开始说道。"我不想别人对我有误解，我不想……我不想别人对这情况有误解。"

"What situation?" Says Hikari annoyed. "You gave a rose to everyone but Asuka, gee Shinji, you ignored her, she is your childhood friend!"  
"什么情况？" 光恼怒地说。"你对每个人都送了玫瑰，唯独漏了明日香，天啊，真嗣，你忽视了她，她可是你的青梅竹马！"

Shinji felt even more ashamed and small, Hikari was right, Asuka did not deserve his weakness, but she would accept his special tribute.  
真嗣感到更加羞愧和渺小，光说得没错，明日香不值得他的软弱，但她会接受他的特别敬意。

"But she won't like it, the rose is not the same as the others!"  
"但她不会喜欢的，这朵玫瑰和其他的不一样！"

Hikari lost the expression on her face, she thought Shinji had done something unique for her friend, with a long breath she asked.  
光子脸上的表情消失了，她以为真嗣为她朋友做了什么特别的事，长叹一口气后问道。

"Do you like her?" “你喜欢她吗？”

Shinji knew he couldn't lie to Hikari, he nodded, his heart aching at the rejection he would receive.  
真嗣知道他不能对光子撒谎，他点点头，心中因即将到来的拒绝而隐隐作痛。

"Then why did you do that?" Said Hikari as she became annoyed again.  
"那为什么你要那么做？" 光再次感到恼火地说道。

"Because you don't seem to care about her."  
"因为你似乎并不关心她。"

Shinji clenched his hands as he became afraid.  
真嗣紧握双手，心中充满了恐惧。

"Because I'm not a person Asuka would like." Says Shinji as he opens his heart, Hikari looked at him calmly.  
"因为我不像明日香会喜欢的那种人。" 真嗣敞开心扉说道，光平静地看着他。

"I'm not the guy she likes, I'm not the best kind of guy, I'm not handsome, I'm not athletic, why would she like me?"  
"我不是她喜欢的那种人，我不是最好的那种人，我不帅，我不擅长运动，她为什么会喜欢我？"

Hikari sighed as she already knew the truth, but could not tell, she only spoke what was most appropriate for the moment.  
光叹了口气，她早已知道真相，却无法说出口，她只能说出当下最合适的话。

"You don't know that." Shinji looked at her doubtfully.  
"你并不知道这一点。" 真嗣怀疑地看着她。

"You never tried... That's your problem Shinji, you don't know everything, always deducing things and missing reality." Hikari spoke dejectedly as she thought about all she knew.  
"你从未尝试过...这就是你的问题，真嗣，你并不知道所有事情，总是推断却忽略了现实。" 光子沮丧地说着，同时回想着她所知道的一切。

"Really Asuka is right, you are an idiot."  
"真的，明日香说得对，你真是个笨蛋。"

With that said, he watched her leave, soon the sound of birds was the only sound passing around him, but his mind was screaming, he had Asuka's face in mind, he had been an idiot.  
说完这些，他目送她离去，很快鸟鸣成了唯一环绕他的声音，但他的内心却在咆哮，脑海中全是明日香的面容，他觉得自己真是愚蠢至极。

"I'm an idiot." “我真是个傻瓜。”

---

Asuka was in her bed, she didn't want to talk to anyone, she only thought about the moment she was completely ignored.  
明日香躺在床上，不想和任何人说话，她满脑子都是那一刻被彻底忽视的情景。

"Why did he do this to me?" Said the redhead as she hugged her pillow, tears streaming down her face, her mind wondering how this could have happened.  
“他为什么要这样对我？”红发女孩抱着枕头，泪水顺着脸颊滑落，心中疑惑这一切是如何发生的。

"Doesn't he think I'm pretty?"  
“难道他觉得我不漂亮吗？”

KNOCK ON THE DOOR. 敲门声。

"Asuka dear, is everything alright, you haven't said anything since you arrived." Kyoko spoke worriedly about her daughter, the way she came home, her downcast look, something had not been good.  
"亲爱的明日香，一切都好吗？你从回来后就一直没说话。" 京子担心地询问她的女儿，明日香回家时的神情低落，显然有什么事情不对劲。

Asuka looked at the door, she wiped her face as she went towards her mother, opening the door she spoke trying to remain calm.  
明日香看着门，她擦了擦脸，走向母亲，打开门时努力保持平静地说道。

"Hi Mom." "嗨，妈妈。"

Kyoko noticed the red look in her eyes, her daughter had been crying, she asked calmly, but becoming tense.  
Kyoko 注意到她眼中的红色，她的女儿一直在哭泣，她平静地问道，但开始紧张起来。

"What happened?" "发生了什么？"

Asuka took a deep breath, she wanted to yell at Shinji for everything he had done, to ask the reasons for all this, she censored her mind as she said the basics.  
Asuka 深吸了一口气，她本想对 Shinji 大喊大叫，质问他这一切的原因，但她控制住自己的思绪，只说了些基本的情况。

"Shinji being a jerk, that's all."  
“Shinji 是个混蛋，仅此而已。”

Kyoko wanted to ask more questions, but she knew how Asuka was, she had her time for everything.  
绫子本想问更多问题，但她了解明日香，她总是按部就班。

"You know you can count on me for anything." Said the woman as she spoke smiling.  
“你知道任何事都可以依靠我。”女人微笑着说道。

"I know mom, I love you for it, but I'm fine, just Shinji being a complete baka."  
“我知道，妈妈，我爱你这一点，但我没事，只是真嗣又犯傻了。”

With that said, Asuka quickly embraced the woman she admired most in the world, feeling the protection her mother gave her, she thought of Shinji, he was not going to get away with all this.  
话音刚落，明日香迅速拥抱了这个世界她最敬仰的女人，感受着母亲给予的保护，她想到了真嗣，他休想就这样逃脱一切。

CAMPAIGN. 运动。

Kyoko let go of her daughter as she went to see who the person at her door was, her eyes widened softly, Shinji was standing in front of her door with a worried look on his face, she wanted to take some satisfaction for him upsetting her daughter, but she knew Asuka would do that later.  
响子松开了女儿，走去看看门口是谁，她的眼睛微微睁大，真嗣站在门前，脸上带着忧虑的表情，她本想为女儿受委屈而对他有些许得意，但她知道明日香稍后会处理这件事。

"Shinji? What are you doing here?"  
"真嗣？你在这里做什么？"

Shinji clenched his hands at the thought of this, he was terrified at the thought of talking to Asuka, but he had to fix what he had done.  
想到这里，真嗣紧握双手，他一想到要和明日香交谈就感到害怕，但他必须弥补自己所做的一切。

"Aunt Kyoko, is Asuka in?"  
"京子阿姨，明日香在吗？"

"What do you want?" Asuka joined her mother with her arms crossed in front of her chest as she learned that Shinji was at her door, she didn't want to talk to him now, not after what she had done at school.  
"你想要什么？" 明日香和她母亲一样，双臂交叉在胸前，得知真嗣在她门口时，她现在不想和他说话，尤其是在学校发生那件事之后。

"Can I...can I talk to you?" Asked Shinji very nervously, Asuka looked at her mother, but knew it would be her decision.  
"我可以...我可以和你谈谈吗？" 真嗣非常紧张地问道，明日香看了看她的母亲，但知道这将是她的决定。

"Okay! Let's go to the courtyard."  
"好吧！我们去院子里。"

Shinji nodded as he saw Asuka walking past him out of his house, he followed her closely taking courage to make his plan, it didn't take long for her to stop and turn on her heels, she focused her intense blue eyes on Shinji, he felt small again, the only sound was the soft music coming from one of the apartments.  
真嗣点头看着明日香从他家走过，他紧随其后，鼓起勇气实施他的计划。没过多久，她便停下脚步，猛地转身，用她那深邃的蓝眼睛紧盯着真嗣。他再次感到自己渺小，唯一的声音是来自某个公寓的轻柔音乐。

Asuka was too upset to wait for Shinji, she crossed her arms as she spoke in irritation.  
明日香太过心烦意乱，以至于无法等待真嗣，她交叉双臂，带着不耐烦的语气说道。

"What!? Speak up!" “什么！？说清楚点！”

Shinji jumped when he heard this, he began to speak with strong nervousness.  
听到这话，真嗣吓了一跳，他开始紧张兮兮地说话。

"I...I want to explain myself about what happened at school." Says Shinji nervously as he looks down, Asuka glared at him but waited for his answers, she raised her eyebrows in anticipation.  
“我……我想解释一下在学校发生的事情。”真嗣紧张地说着，目光低垂，明日香瞪着他，但等待着他的解释，她扬起眉毛，满怀期待。

Shinji thought carefully about his words.  
真嗣仔细斟酌着自己的措辞。

"I'm sorry...I...I don't mean to make you angry."  
"对不起...我...我不是故意惹你生气的。"

"Angry?" Asuka speaks indignantly.  
"生气？" 明日香愤愤不平地说道。"

"You ignored me today at school Shinji!" Asuka lowered her hands in anger.  
"你今天在学校无视我了，真嗣！" 明日香生气地放下了双手。"

"You didn't think how I would feel!?"  
"你没考虑过我的感受吗！？"

Shinji looked down as he heard Asuka's scolding, she was right, he had been an idiot.  
听到明日香的责备，真嗣低下头，她是对的，他一直是个傻瓜。

"I wanted to give you a rose, but I got scared!" Shinji speaks in fear.  
"我想送你一朵玫瑰，但我害怕了！" 真嗣害怕地说道。

"Scared? It's just a damn rose!" Asuka speaks indignantly again.  
"害怕？这不过是一朵该死的玫瑰！" 明日香愤愤不平地说道。

"But... but..." Shinji speaks fearfully, Asuka beginning to lose the end of her calm.  
"但是... 但是..." 真嗣害怕地说，明日香开始失去她的冷静。

"Talk at once dammit!" "快说，该死的！"

"Your rose is special!" Shinji spoke at once, Asuka shut her mouth at the same time, she could only speak.  
“你的玫瑰特别美！” 真嗣立刻说道，明日香同时闭上了嘴，她只能开口。

"What?" "什么？"

Shinji thought things had moved on a bit, he spoke calmly as he opened his bag revealing a beautiful red rose, completely different from the white roses all the other girls had received, in it was a chocolate candy that Asuka liked best, it was a unique gift.  
真嗣觉得事情有所进展，他平静地打开书包，露出了一朵美丽的红玫瑰，与所有其他女孩收到的白玫瑰完全不同，里面有一颗明日香最喜欢的巧克力糖果，这是一份独特的礼物。

Asuka looked at the gift with a flushed face, she took the rose as she saw how beautiful it was, she looked at the small note attached to the handle, on it was written.  
明日香红着脸看着礼物，她接过玫瑰，看到它有多美，她看着附在把手上的小纸条，上面写着。

_The most beautiful rose for the most beautiful.  
献给最美的你，最美丽的玫瑰。_

Feeling like a little girl again, her face flushed with the gift, she asked whatever came to her mind.  
她感觉自己仿佛又变成了一个小女孩，因这份礼物而脸颊泛红，心中所想便脱口而出。

"Because...because mine is different?"  
“因为……因为我的不一样吗？”

Shinji thought about the answer he would give, feeling his face on fire.  
真嗣思索着他会给出的答案，感觉自己的脸像着了火一样。

"I... I don't know, it just felt right..."  
“我……我不知道，只是感觉对了……”

Asuka nodded at this answer, she felt satisfied with this answer for a moment, her mind whirling with nervousness, she looked at the rose.  
明日香对这个回答点了点头，她一时对这个答案感到满意，心中紧张得思绪纷乱，她看着那朵玫瑰。

"Thank you Shinji, really thank you very much." Says Asuka smiling again, but she still wanted to know the reason.  
"谢谢你，真嗣，真的非常感谢。" 明日香再次微笑着说，但她仍然想知道原因。

"But you still haven't answered me, why did you ignore me at school?"  
"但你还没回答我，为什么在学校里不理我？"

Shinji took a deep breath, he thought about his mother and Hikari, this was the time to talk about his feelings, with a quiet calm he began to speak.  
真嗣深吸了一口气，他想到了自己的母亲和光，现在是时候谈谈他的感受了，他平静地开始说话。

"I was afraid you wouldn't like it, I'm not the kind of guy who gives gifts to women like you, I thought you'd hate it."  
"我担心你会不喜欢，我不是那种会给像你这样的女人送礼物的男人，我以为你会讨厌它。"

Asuka sighed at that, how did he think that? He was her best friend in this world, she was slightly annoyed at Shinji's childishness, but her face flushed.  
明日香对此叹了口气，他怎么会这么想呢？他是她在这个世界上最好的朋友，她对真嗣的孩子气有些恼火，但她的脸颊泛起了红晕。

"You're an idiot!" "你这个笨蛋！"

Shinji blinked at this, he was afraid of losing Asuka's friendship, but it made him a little lighter to be able to talk about how he felt, he quickly saw the girl going towards him and giving him the tightest of hugs, his heart was beating strongly in his chest, it seemed that all the sadness had disappeared from his body.  
真嗣对此眨了眨眼，他害怕失去与明日香的友谊，但能够谈论自己的感受让他感到轻松了一些。他很快看到女孩朝他走来，给了他一个最紧的拥抱，他的心脏在胸腔中剧烈跳动，似乎所有的悲伤都从他体内消失了。

Shinji felt on cloud nine with the hug, he wished he could do more than that one day, but at least Asuka didn't hate him. Asuka held Shinji tightly, she thought about his words a few seconds ago.  
真嗣在拥抱中感到飘飘欲仙，他希望有一天能做得更多，但至少明日香并不讨厌他。明日香紧紧地抱着真嗣，她回想起他刚才的话。

"Why did you think I wouldn't like the gift?"  
“你为什么认为我不会喜欢这份礼物？”

Shinji squeezed Asuka harder, he thought about the answer, thinking that Asuka deserved more than the truth right now.  
真嗣更用力地抱紧了明日香，他思考着答案，认为明日香此刻值得的不仅仅是真相。

"I'm not a pretty face, I'm not popular, I'm nothing...so why would you be interested in me?" Shinji spoke dejectedly, Asuka squeezed the boy tighter.  
“我不是什么漂亮脸蛋，也不受欢迎，我什么都不是……那你为什么会对我感兴趣呢？”真嗣沮丧地说道，明日香更紧地抱住了男孩。

"Idiot." Said the blushing woman.  
“笨蛋。”脸红的女子说道。

"As usual you are an idiot, thinking things that don't exist." Says the woman with a little anger, soon she spoke again.  
"像往常一样，你真是个傻瓜，想着那些不存在的东西。" 女人带着一丝怒气说道，很快她又开口了。

"I thought you didn't like me, that you didn't think I was pretty enough to receive the honor."  
"我以为你不喜欢我，以为你觉得我不够漂亮，不配得到这份荣誉。"

Shinji's eyes widened as he heard this, he never thought Asuka was less than perfect, taking a deep breath he spoke.  
听到这话，真嗣的眼睛睁大了，他从没想过明日香有任何不完美之处，深吸一口气后，他开口说道。

"You are beautiful Asuka."  
“你真美，明日香。”

Asuka kissed him lightly on the cheek, it was a simple kiss on his cheek, but for his heart it was a lot, the boy squeezed her even tighter.  
明日香轻轻地在他脸颊上吻了一下，虽然只是个简单的吻，但对他的心来说意义重大，男孩将她抱得更紧了。

Asuka was blushing at what she had done, but it felt right, her heart accepted this moment well, they both began to sway slightly to the quiet music playing in the apartment complex, the music flooded the feelings they both felt for each other, with their eyes closed they both let the warmth of their bodies soothe their hearts.  
明日香因自己的举动而脸颊泛红，但感觉这样做是对的，她的心很好地接受了这一刻。他们随着公寓里播放的轻柔音乐轻轻摇摆，音乐充盈了两人之间的情感，闭上眼睛，他们让彼此身体的温暖抚慰着心灵。

Shinji had always wanted to take Asuka on a date, with a smile he let slip.  
真嗣一直想带明日香去约会，他不经意间露出了微笑。

"It's still early but do you want to go to the movies with me?"  
“时间还早，你想和我一起去看电影吗？”

Asuka opened her eyes as she thought of something, with a smile she spoke.  
明日香想着什么，睁开了眼睛，微笑着说道。

"I thought I wasn't a woman for you?"  
"我以为我不是你心中的女人？"

Shinji's eyes widened as he heard this, but before he could scream or do anything, Asuka held him against her body.  
听到这话，真嗣的眼睛瞪大了，但还没等他尖叫或做出任何反应，明日香就将他紧紧抱在怀里。

"Idiot, I agree to go to the movies with you."  
"傻瓜，我答应和你去看电影了。"

Shinji smiled as he felt Asuka walk away, soon she spoke blushing, she shouted as she ran back to the house.  
真嗣微笑着，感受着明日香离开的脚步，不久她红着脸开口，一边喊着一边跑回屋里。

"Wait for me I'm going to change my clothes!"  
“等等我，我要换衣服！”

Shinji stood still not believing it yet, he was going out on a date with Asuka, not a friends date, but as something that could be deeper for both of them, he calmly sat down on one of the benches and waited.  
真嗣呆立原地，仍不敢相信这一切，他即将与明日香约会，不是朋友间的约会，而是可能对两人关系更进一步的那种，他平静地坐在其中一个长椅上，静静等待。

Kyoko looked at her daughter rushing into her house, she lowered the volume of the television as she asked her daughter.  
京子看着女儿匆匆跑进屋内，她调低了电视的音量，向女儿问道。

"What happened?" "发生了什么？"

Asuka turned around smiling at her mother, a beautiful and completely genuine smile, showing how light and happy her heart was, in her hands the rose and a glass cup with water.  
明日香转过身来，对着母亲露出一个美丽而完全真诚的笑容，展示出她内心的轻松和快乐，手里拿着一朵玫瑰和一杯装满水的玻璃杯。

"Nothing Mom, I'm just happy."  
“没什么，妈妈，我只是很开心。”

Kyoko smiled as she saw her daughter happy, surely the conversation with Shinji had been a good one, and her daughter's happiness was everything to her.  
看到女儿笑容满面，绫子心中也泛起了微笑，与真嗣的对话显然很愉快，女儿的幸福对她来说就是一切。

Choosing a nice outfit, Asuka knew that Shinji always liked her yellow summer dress, perfect for a date night on a warm evening, she looked at the small glass cup on her desk, in it containing the red rose, with a smile she picked it up and thought about how this had all happened, with affection she kissed the red petal, the best gift she could ever get from Shinji.  
挑选了一套漂亮的衣服，明日香知道真嗣总是喜欢她那件黄色的夏日连衣裙，非常适合温暖夜晚的约会。她看着桌上的小玻璃杯，里面插着一朵红玫瑰，微笑着拿起它，思索着这一切是如何发生的。带着深情，她亲吻了那片红瓣，这是真嗣送给她的最美好的礼物。

“真是...太绝了...”  
  
Asushin always warms my heart, seeing them finally complete each-other after so much time of hurt, longing and yearning to connect with one another, even in au just always makes me feel good, and think of how I can improve myself. I really like this SOL theme and aspect of this fic, enjoyed seeing Kyoko and Yui here, would of liked to see them talking together watching Asuka or Shinji's playful banters with each other in the distance giving a sigh and muttering ''Ahh... look at our kids'. My favourite aspect of the story had to be Rei's character being vitalised. No longer being apart of Lilith and medication to keep her docile, as a vibrant young woman is also something I did not know that I wanted to see implemented in fics alot more.  
Asushin 总是温暖我的心，看到他们在经历了那么多的伤害、渴望和渴望彼此连接之后终于相互圆满，即使在 AU 中，也总是让我感觉良好，并思考我如何能提升自己。我真的很喜欢这篇同人文的单恋主题和方面，喜欢看到 Kyoko 和 Yui 在这里，本希望能看到她们一起看着 Asuka 或 Shinji 在远处互相嬉戏，叹息着低语‘啊...看看我们的孩子们’。故事中最让我喜欢的部分是 Rei 的角色被赋予了生命。不再作为莉莉丝的一部分和药物来保持她的温顺，作为一个充满活力的年轻女性，这也是我之前不知道自己希望在更多同人文中看到的。

[YourBlandestNightmare](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/13453602/YourBlandestNightmare): Aaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwww the moment when Asuka finally received her rose was so adorable :) Poor Shinji, once again his fears and lack of self-esteem are his worst enemy. Glad that he was finally able to take a step forward.  
啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊，明日香终于收到她的玫瑰花那一刻真是太可爱了 :) 可怜的真嗣，又一次，他的恐惧和缺乏自信成了他最大的敌人。很高兴他终于能够向前迈出一步。  
  
Also, love this idea for Rei. Shy and polite on the outside, but in the house she has the same genius as Yui xD That's great.  
另外，喜欢这个关于绫波的设定。外表害羞有礼，但在家里她有着和唯一样的天才头脑 xD 太棒了。  
  
Thanks for writing. 感谢您的创作。

[Romulo Nidoking BR](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/109777/Romulo-Nidoking-BR): The cute young romance vibes hit me with waffness and good old Karina Kinechi style while it set up a take on a setting similar to the Ep 26 AU, where Yui's presence and guidance are there to make a difference. A classic ReixAsuka moment that I enjoyed reading. Then, things got back to Shinji and Asuka., The development was great, following a nice pace for this kind of setting and starting to show their differences mixed with their own classic insecurities about each other. The other couples and settings in the school kind of stole the attention for a while. However, it didn't affect the flow and raised the tension for the big moment. I really liked how after the reveal of the present, the tables turned and Shinji's insecurity immediately passed to Asuka when the girls reacted positively to his efforts and we got to the main point of conflict when she didn't receive a rose. It led to a nice Episode 9-like Hikari scene and the big reveal happened: Asuka's rose was different. Then we return to Asuka having a breakdown and being helped by the presence and comfort of Kyoko, albeit in a different way from Yui's, which is good characterization. And then the expected heart-to-heart and a delicious WAFF development of teenage romance. This story was perfect for a one-shot in this setting and the pace was really good overall, slowly building up to the conclusion,. Another gem pulled out by Calbo, the best brazilian Evangelion writer. Someday we will be able to translate his epic stories to English :)  
这段可爱的青春恋爱气息以华夫饼般的甜蜜和经典的 Karina Kinechi 风格扑面而来，同时构建了一个类似第 26 集 AU 的背景，Yui 的存在与引导在此显得尤为关键。我享受着阅读中经典的 Rei 与 Asuka 时刻。随后，故事回归到 Shinji 和 Asuka 身上，发展恰到好处，节奏适宜于这样的环境，并开始展现他们各自的差异与对彼此的经典不安。校园中其他情侣与场景一度抢走了焦点，但这并未影响整体流畅性，反而为高潮时刻增添了紧张感。我很喜欢礼物揭晓后，局势逆转，当女生们对 Shinji 的努力反应积极时，他的不安立刻转移到了 Asuka 身上，而当她未收到玫瑰时，我们触及了冲突的核心。这引出了类似第 9 集 Hikari 的温馨场景，并迎来了重大揭秘：Asuka 的玫瑰与众不同。接着，我们看到 Asuka 崩溃，但在 Kyoko 不同于 Yui 的方式下得到慰藉，这是很好的角色塑造。 随后是预期的交心时刻和一段美味的青少年浪漫发展。这个故事非常适合在这种情境下作为一发完结篇，整体节奏把握得非常好，缓缓推进至高潮。Calbo 再次展现了他作为巴西最佳《EVA》作家的才华，挖掘出了另一颗宝石。总有一天，我们将能把他的史诗故事翻译成英文 :)
