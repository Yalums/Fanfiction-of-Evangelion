In a world devastated by NERV, Third and Fourth Impact, a boy sits in his solitary cell and plays a song he never heard before. Somewhere down a great ship, a Major realizes what empathy means, and a boy discovers what true redemption really is. Sacrifice, pain, and the flicker of a light at the end of the tunnel. Just another EVA story...R&R.
在一个被NERV、第三次和第四次冲击摧毁的世界里，一个男孩坐在他孤独的牢房里，弹奏着一首他从未听过的曲子。在一条大船的某个地方，一位少校意识到同情的意义，一个男孩发现了真正的救赎是什么。牺牲、痛苦，以及隧道尽头的一线光明。只是另一个EVA故事...请阅读和评论。

### Chapter 1 No Woman No Cry  

There was a song in Shinji's SDAT he never listened to. Up until recently, he never even thought it existed in his limited mix-tape; he would usually go back and forth between tracks 24 and 26, never really allowing the small cassette to continue onto track 27. Alone, chained, with an explosive necklace around his neck and nothing but walls and a large observation window around him, Shinji forgot to rewind the tape for once in his life. Track 27 started to play, but he never realized it.  
在真嗣的 SDAT 里，有一首他从未听过的歌。直到最近，他甚至从未意识到这首曲子存在于他有限的混音带中；他通常只在第 24 轨和第 26 轨之间来回切换，从未真正让那盘小小的磁带继续播放到第 27 轨。独自一人，被锁链束缚，脖子上套着爆炸项圈，四周除了墙壁就是巨大的观察窗，真嗣一生中难得忘记了一次倒带。第 27 轨开始播放，但他并未察觉。

The cuffs were ever so slowly starting to bite into the soft flesh of his wrists, but he spoke no complaint. The former Third Child wondered for a moment if he was even capable of speaking properly anymore, but then remembered nobody gave a damn about it. He could die, his head could explode along with his weak, fleshy body and people would only celebrate his demise. For the first full minute of the song, Shinji was unaware of the sound slowly filtering through the ear-buds. Thinking about his own death made him relieve Kaworu's sacrifice again; for a second he was back at the Entry Plug and Kaworu was exploding in a gory spectacle of crimson in front of him.  
手铐正缓慢地咬进他手腕柔软的肉里，但他没有抱怨。这位前第三适格者一时怀疑自己是否还能正常说话，但随即想起根本没人会在乎。他可能会死，他的头可能会连同他那脆弱的肉体一起爆炸，而人们只会庆祝他的消亡。在歌曲的整整一分钟里，真嗣没有意识到声音正慢慢通过耳机传入。思考自己的死亡让他再次经历了渚薰的牺牲；有那么一瞬间，他回到了插入栓中，渚薰在他面前爆炸，血红的一幕惨烈上演。

Shinji blinked, breathing hard. Perspiration slowly leaked from his scalp, making it itch. The pain of the cuffs was to the point of suffocating, suddenly; the walls around him seemed to close off, the necklace felt like it was strangling him, and it all came crashing down.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，呼吸急促。汗水缓缓从头皮渗出，让他感到瘙痒。手铐的疼痛突然变得令人窒息；周围的墙壁似乎在向他逼近，项链感觉像是在勒紧他的脖子，一切都在瞬间崩溃。

The world despised him. Misato despised him. Asuka despised him. His own father despised him to the point of wanting to drive him insane. He had brought about Third and Fourth Impact due to his inability to cope with the trauma of loss and loneliness. Ikari Shinji was the most hated person in the world, and the one human being (or Angel) who had ever shown honest care and concern for him had exploded right before his eyes, in an attempt to save the mighty Third Child from destroying the world. Again.  
世界憎恶他。美里憎恶他。明日香憎恶他。他自己的父亲憎恶他到了想要逼疯他的地步。他因为无法应对失去和孤独的创伤，导致了第三次和第四次冲击。碇真嗣是世界上最被憎恨的人，而唯一一个（无论是人类还是使徒）曾经真心关心过他的人，在他眼前爆炸，试图拯救这位强大的第三适格者，阻止他再次毁灭世界。

The music never stopped playing, and Shinji never wondered at what point he had received his SDAT back, or why he was even listening to it in the first place. He remembered being dragged, slapped and smacked by Asuka, he remembered the Rei-clone watching their interactions with detached frivolity. He remembered Kaworu smiling at him, only to blow up in small chunks of dead flesh all over his half of the Entry Plug.  
音乐从未停止播放，真嗣从未想过自己何时拿回了 SDAT，或者为什么一开始就在听它。他记得被明日香拖拽、掌掴和拍打，记得复制版绫波冷眼旁观他们的互动。他记得薰对他微笑，然后在他驾驶舱的半边爆炸成小块的死肉。

With barely enough time to reach the toilet inside the cell, Shinji fell on his knees and vomited pure, greenish bile over and over, until his stomach was absolutely empty and the gagging reflex stopped altogether. The SDAT never left his hand, and track 27 came and went without him ever noticing. He fell beside the toilet, cold shock making cold sweat drip off his body. When he blinked, Shinji saw Kaworu explode again, he felt Asuka's Entry Plug in his mouth, felt himself bite into it, into _her_. He felt the massive power of Unit 01 as it awakened, he felt the power of God, and he screamed.  
几乎来不及冲进牢房内的厕所，真嗣就跪倒在地，不停地呕吐出纯绿色的胆汁，直到胃里彻底空无一物，干呕的反应才完全停止。SDAT 播放器始终紧握在他手中，第 27 轨音乐播放了一遍又一遍，他却浑然不觉。他瘫倒在马桶旁，冰冷的震惊让冷汗从身体各处渗出。每当他眨眼，真嗣就看到渚薰再次爆炸，感受到明日香插入栓在口中，感受到自己咬了进去，咬到了她。他感受到初号机觉醒时的巨大力量，感受到神的力量，于是他尖叫起来。

Shinji screamed long and loud. There was no-one who cared, anyhow, no-one who would demand him to shut up. His punishment was perfect. All his life he had dreaded being isolated, being totally alone, while at the same time he longed for it as a drug addict longs for the next fix. Now he was alone, isolated, never to touch or speak to another human again. He was to be left alone until he died, with not one person to address half a word to him. So Shinji screamed, and screamed until he was hoarse, until his vocal cords gave out and he was left coughing and gasping for air.  
真嗣尖叫了很久，声音响亮。反正也没人在乎，没人会要求他闭嘴。他的惩罚再完美不过了。他一生都害怕被孤立，完全孤独一人，同时又像吸毒者渴望下一次注射一样渴望着孤独。现在他孤身一人，被隔离，永远不能再触摸或与另一个人交谈。他将被独自留下，直到死去，没有任何人会对他说半个字。于是真嗣尖叫着，尖叫到声音嘶哑，直到声带耗尽，只剩下咳嗽和喘息着呼吸空气。

"_Oh, you don't get to die yet, brat. When your mind is in ashes, when you're so alone you can't stand the sight of yourself in the mirror that you **do** something for once, when everything you've done is healed in this dump of a planet, then, and only then, you'll have my permission to die."_  
“哦，你还不能死，小鬼。当你的心灵化为灰烬，当你孤独到无法忍受镜中自己的模样，当你所做的一切在这颗破败星球上得到治愈，那时，也只有那时，你才能得到我的允许去死。”

Those had been the last words he had heard in four days, and Shinji wondered idly if Asuka would permit him to die now, now that he had lost everything. Alone, broken, with no voice left to scream, the boy allowed himself to cry freely and desperately. Bile, tears and snot leaked from his chin, but the SDAT never stopped playing.  
那是他在四天里听到的最后一句话，真嗣不禁好奇，如今他失去了一切，明日香是否会允许他死去。孤独、破碎，连尖叫的力气都不剩，男孩终于放任自己绝望地哭泣。胆汁、泪水和鼻涕从他的下巴滴落，但 SDAT 的音乐从未停歇。

Slowly, the song soothed something inside him, and his cries of despair turned into quiet sniffles, his broken mind found a tiny solace in the relaxing and melancholic sound of the song. He barely understood English, yet something about the way the lyrics were sung, something about the voice in the tape subdued him, like the Eva's embrace had so long ago. He stayed there, mind numb and body exhausted, he stayed by the toilet, knees drawn up to his chest as the song came and went. It took him more than a full minute to realize the music had stopped, since the last phrase was stuck in his head and kept repeating itself over and over again.  
慢慢地，这首歌抚慰了他内心深处的某些东西，他的绝望哭喊变成了轻声抽泣，他破碎的心灵在这首舒缓而忧郁的旋律中找到了一丝慰藉。他对英语几乎一窍不通，但歌词的唱法、磁带中声音的某些特质却让他平静下来，就像很久以前 Eva 的拥抱一样。他就那样呆坐着，心神麻木，身体疲惫，蜷缩在马桶旁，膝盖紧贴胸口，任由歌曲来去。他花了超过整整一分钟才意识到音乐已经停止，因为最后一句歌词在他脑海中不断重复，一遍又一遍。

For once in his life, Shinji wished he had an English-Japanese dictionary, just so he could understand what the word ´_Redemption_´ meant.  
在生命中的这一刻，真嗣第一次希望自己有一本英日词典，只为弄明白“救赎”这个词的含义。

The screen did not lie. The Major had always known it wouldn't take much time for the boy to crack, but four days seemed awfully brief, even for Idiot Shinji. She knew Misato had not spoken for two years after Second Impact, but this was different, it was not just coping with a traumatic experience.  
屏幕没有撒谎。玛吉尔少校一直知道这孩子撑不了多久，但四天似乎也太短暂了，即便是对笨蛋真嗣来说。她知道美里在第二次冲击后两年没有说话，但这次不同，不仅仅是应对创伤经历那么简单。

Shinji's traumas were gaining on his sanity, he was slowly losing his grip on reality, slowly crawling back into his decaying mind to hide away from the pain and guilt and rage which consumed him. She tried to sound honest when she laughed at it, at _him_, but it never truly felt honest in her chest, and the snickering and laughter of the crew members only sickened her to her stomach and made her want to kick their teeth in.  
真嗣的创伤正逐渐侵蚀他的理智，他正慢慢失去对现实的掌控，缓缓退缩回他那腐朽的心灵深处，以逃避那吞噬他的痛苦、罪恶感和愤怒。她试图在嘲笑这一切、嘲笑他时显得真诚，但内心深处却从未真正感到真诚，而船员们的窃笑和嘲笑只让她感到恶心，甚至想踢碎他们的牙齿。

Almost everyone in the WUNDER had taken his or her turn to watch the meek boy squirm in his own misery, some hovered over the screen to watch as he sat there, barely eating, barely breathing, barely existing, with a disturbed look in his eye, but Asuka discovered the laughter died quickly enough when he started to scream. They all had better things to do with their time, anyways. A big battle was coming, probably their last stand against NERV and the deranged Ikari Gendou, but most of them were only concerned with watching Ikari Shinji suffer.  
WUNDER 上的几乎每个人都轮流观赏过这个温顺的男孩在自己的痛苦中挣扎，有些人甚至凑近屏幕，看着他坐在那里，几乎不吃不喝，几乎不呼吸，几乎不存在，眼中流露出不安的神情，但当真嗣开始尖叫时，明日香发现笑声很快就消失了。毕竟，他们都有更重要的事情要做。一场大战即将来临，很可能是他们与 NERV 和疯狂的碇源堂的最后一战，但大多数人只关心看着碇真嗣受苦。

It took a special type of personality to find pleasure in another person's pain, even if that person was Shinji. Behind her, the Major could feel the hungry look of the most vengeful members of the crew, she could feel as they enjoyed every tear, every scream, and wondered if they would be capable to physically torture Shinji just to make him scream louder, if it was possible. For four days his inaction and plain detachment had made those sick fucks giggle like schoolgirls, and whereas his pain made many of WILLIE disgusted, it had pleased part of the crew to a point. It was like their favorite TV show, their small victory over NERV. A memento, not a human being.  
能从他人的痛苦中找到快感，这种性格可谓特殊，即便那人是真嗣。在她身后，少校能感受到船员中最怀恨在心的那些人饥渴的目光，她能感觉到他们享受着每一滴泪水、每一声尖叫，并好奇他们是否能对真嗣进行肉体折磨，只为让他叫得更响亮，如果可能的话。四天来，他的无所作为和平淡的冷漠让那些变态们像女学生一样咯咯笑个不停，而他的痛苦虽然让 WILLIE 的许多人感到厌恶，却让部分船员感到愉悦。这就像他们最喜欢的电视节目，是对 NERV 的小小胜利。一个纪念品，而非一个活生生的人。

When he stopped screaming and started to cry, though, the interest of even the sickest ones waned over his weakness. His patheticness. His idiocy. All the things she had accused him of being for the past fifteen years. Crying simply made him human, and most of them could not afford to think of Shinji in such terms. She never had truly treated him kindly, she should be pleased most shared her former beliefs now.  
然而，当他停止尖叫开始哭泣时，即便是最病态的人对他软弱的兴趣也减弱了。他的可怜，他的愚蠢。所有她过去十五年里指责他的那些特质。哭泣只是让他显得更像人，而他们大多数人无法承受以这种方式看待真嗣。她从未真正善待过他，现在大多数人分享她过去的看法，她应该感到高兴。

There was no pleasure in her chest, however. She felt no joy, did not partake in any enjoyment through his pain. The anger, ever present in her, died off like a fire being put out when he screamed like that. The Major could not understand why it wasn't funny to her, why she even bothered to notice him anymore. He was a prisoner, forever to be left in isolation for his crimes against humanity, a criminal as bad as NERV. _Yeah, right..._She told herself over and over she had to hate him, hate him to the core and kill him like she had apparently indented when they'd fought, but her chest was empty. It was a lie, killing Shinji... it did not feel right. All she felt was a rotting, consuming sense of empathy and something she hadn't been able to figure out for fourteen years.  
然而，她的内心并未因此感到愉悦。她没有因他的痛苦而获得任何快感。那股始终萦绕在她心头的怒火，在他那般尖叫声中如同被扑灭的火焰般消散。少校无法理解为何这情景对她而言并不滑稽，为何她还要费心去关注他。他是个囚犯，因对人性的罪行而永远被隔离，其罪恶之深与 NERV 无异。没错...她一遍遍地告诫自己必须恨他，恨之入骨，像他们战斗时她显然打算的那样杀了他，但她的内心却是空荡荡的。杀死真嗣...这感觉不对。她所感受到的只是一种腐朽、吞噬性的同情感，以及一种她十四年来始终未能解开的情感。

The Major did not know why she could just not hate Shinji properly like she had for years, but Asuka knew very well. He was just a boy, a brat. He hadn't been trained; he hadn't been given time to even absorb the horrors around him. Trauma after devastating trauma, she, Misato, NERV, SEELE and the world had managed to break him completely, to destroy any foundation of humanity and sanity within his young, unprepared mind. Fourteen years of Eva-induced sleep, only to wake into a world that despised him. Alone, completely and absolutely abandoned, left to carry the weight of Third and Fourth Impact on his shoulders. Chained, locked inside a cell with a disciplinary necklace like an animal, isolated from everyone around him, with nothing but his thoughts and his guilt.  
玛丽少校不明白为什么她就是无法像多年来那样彻底憎恨真嗣，但明日香心里非常清楚。他只是个孩子，一个毛头小子。他没有接受过训练；他没有时间去消化身边的恐怖。一次又一次的毁灭性创伤，她、美里、NERV、SEELE 以及整个世界，成功地将他彻底击垮，摧毁了他年轻、未准备好面对这一切的心灵中任何人性与理智的根基。十四年的 EVA 引发的沉睡，醒来却面对一个憎恶他的世界。孤独，完全且绝对地被遗弃，被迫肩负起第三次和第四次冲击的重担。被锁链束缚，像动物一样戴着惩戒项圈关在牢房里，与周围所有人隔绝，除了自己的思绪和罪恶感别无他物。

Her hatred peaked. _Poor, poor little Shinji, nobody took care of him,_ she thought viciously. _Poor Shinji never had a chance, he's only too weak to act on his own._ Her teeth ground together when she remembered the fight. _You attacked me, Me! You almost blew us all to shit! Again!_ It felt hollow, though. _Traitor,_ she thought, _You turned your back on us. "You turned your back on **me**"_, a little voice whispered in her head. But why should he haved stayed, really? They had trated him like a criminal, like a misbehaved dog. What were they expecting? What could she expect from him, and why should she bother? She should just hate him some more.  
她的恨意达到了顶峰。可怜的小真嗣，没人照顾他，她恶狠狠地想。可怜的真嗣从未有机会，他只是太软弱，无法自己行动。当她回想起那场战斗时，她的牙齿咬得咯咯作响。你攻击了我，我！你差点把我们都炸成碎片！又一次！但这种感觉很空洞。叛徒，她想，你背叛了我们。“你背叛了我”，一个微弱的声音在她脑海中低语。但他为什么要留下，真的吗？他们把他当作罪犯，当作一只不听话的狗。他们在期待什么？她能从他那里期待什么，她为什么要费心？她应该更加恨他。

It felt hollow. Hating Shinji felt hollow, useless.  
这种感觉很空洞。恨真嗣的感觉空洞无用。

So the Major stared stoically at the screen, wishing she could punch him to death, while a part of Asuka wished she could just scream at him like he had screamed at the walls, and another part of her longed to hold him, soothe him somehow, make his pain go away. It still hurt to see him in pain; it still hurt to know she had helped kill the one person who had been kind to her for no particular reason.  
于是少校面无表情地盯着屏幕，真希望自己能一拳把他打死，而阿斯卡心中的一部分只想像他对墙壁吼叫那样对他大喊大叫，另一部分却渴望拥抱他，安抚他，设法减轻他的痛苦。看到他受苦依然让她心痛；知道她帮助杀死了那个无缘无故对她好的人，依然让她心痛。

It still hurt to watch him and know he was even farther away, slowly drifting, drifting into insanity. And it still disgusted her to know she was still vulnerable, if only to him. By all rights she should hate him to the core, but when he screamed like that, when he cried so desperately and his pain and guilt were so obvious and apparent, she could not. It was like hating herself, and Asuka was tired of it.  
看着他，知道他离自己越来越远，慢慢陷入疯狂，依然让她心痛。而知道自己仍然只对他脆弱，依然让她感到厌恶。按理说她应该恨他入骨，但当他那样尖叫，那样绝望地哭泣，他的痛苦和罪恶感如此明显时，她却做不到。这就像恨自己一样，而阿斯卡已经厌倦了。

So life in the WUNDER carried on, the fourth day since their salvage came and went, but the Major stayed when all other members of the crew left. Her only eye showed nothing but pure hatred, her mask was in place, so not one person questioned why she stayed. Mari mocked her, Misato reprimanded her, but all those things Asuka barely registered. She absorbed every detail, every frown and every tear and made sure they were genuine before she marched away into her quarters, where the dictionary was located.  
于是，WUNDER 号上的生活依旧继续，自他们救起他已过去四天，但当其他船员都离开时，少校却留了下来。她仅剩的那只眼中透露出纯粹的憎恨，面具般的表情让人无从质疑她为何留下。玛丽嘲讽她，美里训斥她，但这些阿斯纳几乎未曾留意。她吸收着每一个细节，每一道皱眉和每一滴泪水，确保它们都是真实的，然后才迈步走回自己的房间，那里放着那本词典。

In four days she had heard him utter two words, two words she understood very well, but knew he did not. So Shikinami Asuka Langley took out her English-Japanese dictionary, marked the pages where the words were located and marched over to the solitary cell of Ikari Shinji.  
四天里，她只听到他说了两个词，两个她非常熟悉却知道他不理解的词。于是，式波·明日香·兰格雷拿出她的英日词典，标记了那两个词所在的页码，走向碇真嗣的单人牢房。

The words kept repeating themselves in her head, so she'd have an explanation from him, even if it took her beating him half to death to obtain it. What was the big idea behind them, anyway? They were just words, not even spoken in his mother tongue, but they seemed to make him better, make him calm. So she'd destroy it, or construct it, or build it over again, but Asuka and the Major would have their answers. The words felt like a song, something sad but reviving, something spiritual, if she believed in such nonsense, and it irked her to know he said nothing but those tiny meaningless words.  
那些话在她脑海中不断回响，她决心要从他那里得到解释，哪怕这意味着要让他半死不活。这些话背后到底有什么深意？它们不过是些文字，甚至不是用他的母语说的，但它们似乎让他变得更好，让他平静。所以她要摧毁它，或者重建它，或者彻底重构它，但明日香和玛丽少校会得到答案。这些话感觉像一首歌，既悲伤又振奋人心，如果她相信那些无稽之谈，那简直就是一种精神上的东西，而知道他除了那些微不足道的无意义话语什么也没说，让她感到恼火。

What the hell was a Redemption Song, anyway?  
究竟什么是‘救赎之歌’呢？

_**TBC**_…

Raw and bloodied fingers clutched the battered, worn out SDAT with whatever meager strength they possessed, wrist shaking with exhaustion at the effort of bringing the small device closer. With his one useful hand, Shinji slowly grabbed the earbud and placed it in his right ear, almost collapsing from exertion and losing consciousness again. The hole in his shoulder where Sakura's bullet was lodged had stopped bothering him from the moment he'd climbed into the entry plug; it nipped every now and then, like a wasp's sting he could simply not scratch away. The pain in every other part of his body was dulled by what he suspected was blood loss and a concussion, but it made little difference anymore.  
血迹斑斑的手指紧紧抓住那台破旧不堪的 SDAT，竭尽所能地用微薄之力将其拉近，手腕因用力而颤抖不已。仅剩的一只可用之手，真嗣缓缓拿起耳塞，塞入右耳，几乎因用力过度而再次昏厥。肩上被樱的子弹射穿的伤口，自他爬进插入栓后便不再困扰他，只是偶尔如蜂蜇般刺痛，却无法挠去。身体其他部位的疼痛因失血和疑似脑震荡而变得迟钝，但这一切已无关紧要。

A strangled, wet cough made its way up his throat, sprinkling blood on the already tainted plugsuit. His ribs felt like a bag of broken glass cutting away at his insides, and there was some kind of fluid inside his chest stopping him from breathing properly. A wheezing sound accompanied every labored intake of air he was able to swallow, and whenever he exhaled some of the fluid jumped back to his mouth, some metallic-tasting liquid that dripped from his chin.  
他喉咙里发出一声窒息般的湿咳，血滴溅在早已污秽的驾驶服上。肋骨如同碎玻璃袋般切割着内脏，胸腔内某种液体阻碍了正常呼吸。每一次费力的吸气都伴随着喘息声，每当呼气时，那股金属味的液体便回流至口中，从下巴滴落。

It was done though; it was finished. He had his permission now, so he gulped down the metallic taste and managed a weak, labored breath.  
事情已经完成，结束了。他现在得到了许可，于是咽下那股金属味，费力地深吸了一口气，显得虚弱而吃力。

Push. Rewind. Stop. Play.  
推。倒带。停止。播放。

**(Intro: Guitar chords)  （前奏：吉他和弦）**

The ghost of a small smile made its way to his lips when the first chords of the now familiar song began to play, lulling his troubled mind into silence and what he suspected felt like inner peace. His head bumped back against the seat, right arm dangling from the control joke and left arm unmoving. It hurt to breathe.  
当那首如今已熟悉的歌曲的第一个和弦响起时，一丝淡淡的微笑悄然爬上他的唇边，抚慰着他纷乱的心绪，带给他一种疑似内心宁静的感觉。他的头靠在座椅上，右臂从操纵杆上垂下，左臂静止不动。每一次呼吸都伴随着疼痛。

_Old pirates yes they rob I…  
老海盗，是的，他们抢了我……_

_Sold I to the merchant ships…  
把我卖给了商船……_

_Minutes after they took I…  
他们带走我几分钟后……_

_From the bottomless pit… 从无底深渊……_

Shinji coughed again, making the pain and agony of his body more acute. Crimson and pinkish froth sprinkled his lips, yet he failed to register it. His whole body was starting to burn once again; the hundreds of needles surrounding his brain hit home with enough force to make him dizzy while his limbs complained with pure, unadulterated agony. The brightness that filtered through the collapsed surface of the entry plug and the broken concrete ceiling seemed dimmer every time he closed his eyes to blink, and when it hit his eyelids the light blinded him with an unbearable headache. The world swam in and out of focus.  
真嗣再次咳嗽，身体的疼痛和痛苦更加剧烈。鲜红和粉红色的泡沫溅在他的唇上，他却浑然不觉。他的全身又开始燃烧；数百根针刺入他的大脑，力度之大让他头晕目眩，而四肢则纯粹、无掺杂地诉说着痛苦。透过破损的插入栓表面和破碎的水泥天花板透进来的光线，每次他眨眼时似乎都变得更加暗淡，当光线触及他的眼睑时，那光芒带来的头痛让他难以忍受。世界在他眼前时隐时现。

_But my head was made strong  
但我的头脑变得坚强_

_By the 'and of the Almighty  
在全能者的末尾_

_We forward in this generation…  
我们这一代人正向前迈进……_

_Triumphantly…  凯旋般地…_

_Won't you help to sing…  
你不愿一起歌唱吗……_

_These songs of freedom? 这些自由之歌？_

'_Cause all I ever had…_  
因为我所拥有的一切……

_Redemption songs… 救赎之歌……_

"Redemption songs…" Shinji muttered, eliciting more coughing from his battered midsection. The rusted metal rod protruding from his abdomen was stained with blood, and more continued to stain the plugsuit dark as time went by and the song carried on. A similar, slightly thicker rod stuck out of his left leg, anchoring the young pilot to the chair of his entry plug. His left arm felt like it was broken, for he could not move it. His right was barely of any use with a bullet comfortably resting in his shoulder. Crimson dribbled from his seat and fell to the ground, fell from his forehead and dribbled on his suit, fell from his mouth and dribbled onto his chest. A small voice told him, there in the back of his aching head, that he should attempt to apply pressure and try to stop the bleeding.  
“救赎之歌……”真嗣喃喃自语，随即因受伤的腹部而引发一阵咳嗽。一根生锈的金属棒从他的腹部穿出，血迹斑斑，随着时间的推移和歌声的继续，更多的血迹染红了驾驶服。另一根稍粗的棒子从他的左腿伸出，将这位年轻的驾驶员固定在插入栓的座椅上。他的左臂感觉像是断了，因为他无法移动它。右肩嵌着一颗子弹，使得右手几乎无法使用。鲜血从他的座位滴落到地面，从额头滴落到驾驶服上，从嘴角滴落到胸前。在他疼痛的脑海深处，有个微弱的声音告诉他，应该设法施加压力，试图止血。

What for, though? He had his permission.  
但为什么呢？他已经获得了许可。

A miniature red puddle formed underneath the plug; the debris of the fallen building threatened to fall over and crush the burnt, half-destroyed metal cylinder, while his life-blood continued to color the otherwise blank concrete rocks under him. Crimson droplets fell steadily, gently cascading through the rods and the seat to settle and stain what had once been the third floor of a forgotten shopping mall.  
插头下形成了一小滩红色的血泊；倒塌建筑的残骸摇摇欲坠，似乎要将那烧焦、半毁的金属圆筒压碎，而他的生命之血仍在为身下的空白混凝土石块染上色彩。鲜红的血滴稳定而轻柔地穿过杆子和座椅，落在曾是某座被遗忘商场三楼的地方，留下污迹。

_Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery…  
从精神奴役中解放自己……_

_None bout ourselves can free our minds.  
唯有我们自己才能解放我们的思想。_

_Have no fear for atomic energy…  
无需畏惧原子能……_

'_Cause none of them can' a stop the time…

_How long shall they kill our prophets…

我们必须完成这本书。_

The melody smoothed out his thoughts, taking away the pain, if only for a few precious seconds. Ironic. He was the very definition of irony. He had survived the blast, but not the landing. He, who had almost brought about the end of the world twice, could not live through two metal rods and a bullet. It was almost funny, in a way; it seemed like something Asuka would laugh at. Regardless, Shinji's smile widened as he turned his bleeding head to the skies.  
旋律抚平了他的思绪，带走了痛苦，尽管只是短暂的几秒钟。讽刺的是，他本身就是讽刺的化身。他幸存于爆炸，却未能挺过坠落。那个几乎两次引发世界末日的人，却无法在两根金属杆和一颗子弹下存活。在某种程度上，这几乎可笑；似乎是明日香会嘲笑的事情。尽管如此，真嗣的微笑却因他转向流血的天空而扩大。

Blue. The sky was blue, for once. No clouds, no crimson, no angel-like creatures projecting a large, red AT-Field. Just… blue, beautiful. How long now, how long had it been since he had watched the sky? _Asuka's eyes…_ he thought lamely. _That's the color of her eyes…eye … sky-blue._ Gentler shades of blue dulled by moving clouds moved along his right, creating a paler shade of cerulean. _Rei's hair was like that…_  
蓝色。天空难得一见的蓝色。没有云朵，没有猩红，没有天使般的生物投射出巨大的红色 AT 力场。只是……蓝色，美丽。已经多久了，他有多久没有仰望天空了？明日香的眼睛……他笨拙地想着。那是她眼睛的颜色……眼睛……天蓝色。随着移动的云朵，更柔和的蓝色调在他右侧延伸，形成了一种较淡的蔚蓝色。丽的发色就像那样……

_Won't you help to sing…  
你不愿一起歌唱吗……_

_These songs of freedom? 这些自由之歌？_

'_Cause all I ever had…_  
因为我所拥有的一切……

_Redemption songs… 救赎之歌……_

_Redemption songs… 救赎之歌……_

"Redemption songs…" Ever so slowly, the SDAT started to slip out of his grasp, ripping the earbud away as it fell to the ground with a resounding crunch. Shinji didn't notice; the song was seared into his brain. The melody, the lyrics, everything, just like every other track on the small cassette; he could sing it by memory now. Sleep was starting to overtake him, eyelids suddenly unnaturally heavy as exhaustion pressed up against his awareness. He couldn't remember the last time he had been so sleepy or so tired.  
“救赎之歌……”SDAT 播放器缓缓从他手中滑落，耳机被猛地扯下，伴随着一声响亮的碎裂声坠落地面。真嗣并未察觉；那首歌已深深烙印在他的脑海中。旋律、歌词，一切的一切，就像那盘小磁带上的每一首曲子一样；他现在可以凭记忆唱出来了。睡意开始侵袭他，眼皮突然变得异常沉重，疲惫感压迫着他的意识。他不记得自己上一次如此困倦或疲惫是什么时候了。

Still, happiness danced in his broken heart, for once. The leathery surface of his seat was not in the slightest bit worn out; it was comfortable, _unbelievably_ comfortable. Even when the strong, cold winds rocked whatever remained of his entry plug back and forth, it still felt warm to him, like the mother's embrace he had long yearned for. The tenderness of his mother's last words coursed through him while more blood made its way to the floor, tinting the rocks and producing a small drip-drip sound in the otherwise silent wreckage.  
尽管如此，他的破碎心灵中仍跳跃着一丝幸福。座椅的皮革表面丝毫未损，异常舒适，舒适得令人难以置信。即便强劲的寒风摇晃着他残存的插入栓，他依然感到温暖，宛如他长久渴望的母亲的怀抱。母亲临终的温柔话语在他心中流淌，更多的血液流向地面，染红了岩石，在寂静的残骸中发出细微的滴答声。

_Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery…  
从精神奴役中解放自己……_

_None bout ourselves can free our minds.  
唯有我们自己才能解放我们的思想。_

_Have no fear for atomic energy…  
无需畏惧原子能……_

'_Cause none of them can' a stop the time…  
因为没有任何力量能阻止时间的流逝……_

_How long shall they kill our prophets…  
他们还要杀害我们多少先知……_

_While we stand aside and look? Oh!  
当我们站在一旁观看？哦！_

_Some say it's just a part of it…  
有人说，这只是其中一部分……_

_We've got to fulfill the book.  
我们必须完成这本书。_

He smiled again, the motion pushing out the blood in his mouth. Rei was safe, and so was Asuka. So was Misato. It was all that mattered, all that had ever mattered. He'd done it, and yet he was still reliving the past. Now, with his life slowly draining away, he couldn't help but accept his mistakes, atone, and beg for forgiveness sincerely, probably for the first time in his life. He'd done what he could, and now it was time to sleep. Blood dribbled down his chin.  
他再次微笑，这一动作推动着嘴里的血液流出。丽安全了，明日香也是，美里也一样。这些才是最重要的，一直都是。他做到了，然而仍在重温过去。如今，生命缓缓流逝之际，他不禁开始承认自己的错误，寻求宽恕，真诚地祈求原谅，这或许是他一生中的第一次。他已尽力而为，现在该是安睡的时候了。血从他的下巴滴落。

_Won't you help me sing…  
你不愿与我同唱……_

_These songs of freedom? 这些自由之歌？_

'_Cause all I ever had…_  
因为我所拥有的一切……

_Redemption songs… 救赎之歌……_

_Redemption songs…  救赎之歌……_

"Redemp…tion… songs…" Shinji closed his eyes, grinning brightly with bloodied teeth, and let darkness overtake him.  
“救赎…之歌…” 真嗣闭上双眼，带着血迹斑斑的牙齿灿烂地笑着，任由黑暗吞没了他。

**One Month Before 一个月前**

His confinement in WILLE Headquarters was disturbingly similar to his brief stay in NERV. Food was served twice a day, a strange assortment of colored pastes meant to keep his body working that tasted of nothing. He had a small bed, a metal chair and a small table. So far, two books had been handed to him, yet he had not so much as looked at them. His clothes were demanded of him every two days, and brought freshly washed and stiff as a board on the same afternoon, or morning, or night. So far, he had not seen a single person come or go, but the red dot on the camera never went off.  
他在 WILLE 总部的囚禁与在 NERV 短暂停留时的境遇惊人地相似。一日两餐，供应的是各种颜色糊状物，旨在维持身体机能却毫无味道。他有一张小床、一把金属椅子和一张小桌。迄今为止，他收到了两本书，却连翻都没翻过。每两天，他的衣物会被收走，当天下午、早晨或晚上，又会送回洗净且硬如木板的衣服。至今，他未曾见到任何人进出，但摄像头上的红点始终未曾熄灭。

His cell was cleaned automatically on a daily basis as well. Small robots came and went, washing away any trace of dirt or sweat -not that there was much to begin with- creating a small spectacle around his bed. Shinji barely moved; he was either curled up on his bed or curled up in one of the corners of the room, trying to force the naked shock, horrid images and sickening guilt deeper into his stomach. So far, he had managed to gulp down most of the shock, but the full extent of what he had lived and caused were still almost impossible to grasp. Angry words, Misato threatening him with a gun, the cold touch on his forehead, the screams; it all swam in and out of focus. _Fourth Impact. Averted. Loss of Unit 02-Dash, Unit-08 heavily damaged. My fault. Again. Isn't it all?_  
他的牢房也每日自动清洁。小型机器人来回穿梭，洗去任何污迹或汗渍——原本也不多——在他床边上演着小小的奇观。真嗣几乎不动；他要么蜷缩在床上，要么蜷缩在房间的某个角落，试图将赤裸的震惊、可怕的画面和令人作呕的罪恶感深深压入胃中。到目前为止，他已设法吞下了大部分的震惊，但他所经历和造成的全部后果仍几乎难以把握。愤怒的话语，美里用枪威胁他，额头的冰冷触感，尖叫声；这一切都在焦点内外游移。第四次冲击。被阻止了。二号机损失，八号机严重受损。我的错。又一次。难道不都是吗？

The lights were shut off at some point during the day, and reactivated eight hours later. At least he guessed it was eight hours, enough time for the crew to sleep and rest. The silence and darkness of those hours would have scared him, were he not already muted and terrified beyond comparison. The cuffs had been removed at some point during the first days, leaving half-healed scabs and angry purple bruises all over his left wrist. By the smell of it, one of the small wounds was starting to catch an infection, but the pain was good. Pain allowed him to stay awake.  
白天某个时刻，灯光被关闭，八小时后重新开启。至少他猜测是八小时，足够船员们睡觉和休息。那几个小时的寂静与黑暗本会吓到他，若非他早已麻木且恐惧至极。最初几天，手铐被取下，留下左腕上未愈的结痂和紫红的瘀伤。从气味判断，其中一个小伤口似乎开始感染，但疼痛是好的。疼痛让他保持清醒。

Shinji couldn't remember the last time he'd slept.  
真嗣记不清上次入睡是什么时候了。

Every time he closed his eyes, Kaworu's head and body exploded into a cloud of blood and guts. How many days had passed? He couldn't tell. How long would he be confined to his new cell? He didn't care. His cheeks were mangled from the inside; every time he felt he was losing consciousness he bit down as hard as he could, most of the time tasting iron as he drew blood. He'd almost done it twice now; almost put an end to the world and humanity in a hissy fit. Was he really so predictable, so easy to figure out, that everyone but him had known what he would do, how he would react? Was he really such a pitiful little boy?
每次他闭上眼睛，Kaworu的头和身体就会爆炸成一团血肉。已经过去多少天了？他无法分辨。他还要被关在新牢房里多久？他不在乎。他的脸颊从内部被撕裂；每次他感觉自己快要失去意识时，他都会尽可能用力地咬下去，大多数时候尝到铁的味道，因为他咬出了血。他几乎已经做了两次；几乎在一个发脾气中结束了世界和人类。他真的那么可预测，那么容易被看穿，以至于除了他自己，每个人都知道他会做什么，他会如何反应？他真的那么可怜吗？

His father certainly knew him; the old bastard had counted on Shinji being a stupid, gullible brat and led him to the EVA as if he were a mouse searching for cheese. He wondered idly if it had all been a fun game to his father, to make him lean on Kaworu when destroyed by the crushing guilt of his former actions, and then start a Fourth Impact as easily as if he were setting a shogi board. It all seemed so beautifully macabre to Shinji, every move coldly calculated and executed with precision, regardless of what needed to be sacrificed. Fuyutsuki had said his father was even willing to give away his soul to complete the ambition of Human Instrumentality. The thought of it forced revulsion out of the Third Child's chest, making him dry-heave for a second before he regained his composure. There was barely anything left in his stomach to vomit, anyway; he could not remember the last time he had actually eaten, either.  
他的父亲无疑了解他；那老混蛋算准了真嗣是个愚蠢、容易上当的小子，把他引向 EVA，就像引一只寻觅奶酪的老鼠。他漫不经心地想，这一切对他父亲来说是否只是一场有趣的游戏，让他依赖卡尔，在他被先前行为的沉重罪恶感击垮时，然后轻易地引发第四次冲击，就像摆设将棋棋盘一样简单。这一切对真嗣来说似乎如此诡异而美丽，每一步都冷酷地计算并精确执行，无论需要牺牲什么。冬月曾说，他的父亲甚至愿意舍弃自己的灵魂来完成人类补完的野心。这个念头迫使第三适格者胸中涌出厌恶，让他干呕了一会儿才恢复镇定。反正他的胃里也没什么可吐的了；他甚至记不清上次真正进食是什么时候。

Fear started to dig at his fading mind, the now familiar fear of falling unconscious. He tried biting down on his cheek, on his tongue, pinching himself until a reddish bruise formed, and yet the heaviness persisted. He didn't want to sleep. Ever.  
恐惧开始侵蚀他逐渐消退的意识，那种熟悉的、害怕失去知觉的恐惧。他尝试咬紧脸颊、舌头，掐自己直到形成红肿的瘀伤，但沉重感依旧持续。他不想入睡。永远不想。

_In. Out. In. Out. Breathe. Breathe, Shinji.  
吸气。呼气。吸气。呼气。呼吸，真嗣。_

And yet he was falling asleep again, Shinji dully realized. _Must…not… sleep. Mustn't sleep, mustn't dream._ Memories came and went slowly at first; turning with time into knifes that dug into his brain, rendering the young pilot unable to think clearly, if at all. The more he struggled to breathe and focus his mind on nothing, the heavier the thoughts turned, the voices. There was no SDAT to escape to anymore; the battery had been dead for half a day. Or a day, he didn't know, didn't remember. Nothing made sense anymore; time had no meaning, not for the horrors that patiently waited in his subconscious. His head started lolling back and forth, the floor suddenly felt like a fine feather mattress, so Shinji shook his head to clear it, only succeeding in making it worse.  
然而他又开始昏昏欲睡，真嗣麻木地意识到。必须……不能……睡。不能睡，不能做梦。记忆起初缓缓来去；随着时间推移变成利刃，刺入他的大脑，使这位年轻驾驶员无法清晰思考，甚至无法思考。他越是挣扎着呼吸，越是努力让思绪放空，那些念头和声音就越沉重。再也没有 SDAT 可以逃避了；电池已经死了半天。或者一天，他不知道，也不记得。一切都不再有意义；时间失去了意义，那些潜意识中耐心等待的恐怖亦然。他的头开始前后摇晃，地板突然感觉像柔软的羽绒床垫，于是真嗣摇了摇头试图清醒，结果却更糟。

_Must not sleep. Stay. Stay awake, don't dream. Don't go there._ The death of Kaworu flashed through him once again, as clear as the day it had happened, making him cringe. _Don't. Don't go there, Shinji._ The world went black, and Shinji was swallowed by the crushing weight of his own exhaustion. When sleep won over the battle, the thoughts returned with a vengeance and denied him even the slightest bit of rest.  
绝不能入睡。坚持住。保持清醒，别做梦。别去那里。卡罗尔之死的画面再次清晰地闪现，如同当日重现，让他不禁退缩。不要。别去那里，真嗣。世界陷入黑暗，真嗣被自己沉重的疲惫吞没。当睡眠战胜了挣扎，思绪卷土重来，毫不留情地剥夺了他片刻的安宁。

_**None of your business.**_ _Must not remember._ _**Don't pilot the Eva.**_ _Must not sleep._ _**Pilot the Eva. Goodbye, Shinji.**_ _Mustn't run away._ _**None of your business.**_ _Must stay awake._ _**That's a DSS Choker.**_ _Mustn't think._ _**The Spear of Cassius. Something isn't right.**_ _Must not remember._ _**Shinji, we should stop this…**_ _Don't remember._ _**Goodbye, Shinji.**_ _Don't remember._ _**Shinji, I think we should stop this. You brat, stop! Shinji, Shinji, Shinji.**_ _Don't, please._ _**None of your business. Rei is merged with Unit 1. None of your business.**_ _Stop it._ _**It was caused by you. Die already, you stupid brat!**_ _Please. Just let me sleep._ _**None of your business.**_ _Help._ _**Stop it, you brat!.**_ _Help me._ _**Goodbye, Shinji. Goodbye, Shinji. Can't even stand on your own two feet? Pathetic.**_ _Help me, somebody._ _**Goodbye, Shinji.**_ **BOOM!**  
与你无关。必须忘记。不要驾驶 EVA。绝不能入睡。驾驶 EVA。再见，真嗣。不能逃避。与你无关。必须保持清醒。那是 DSS 项圈。不能思考。卡西乌斯之矛。有些不对劲。必须忘记。真嗣，我们该停下了……别记起。再见，真嗣。别记起。真嗣，我觉得我们应该停下。你这小子，住手！真嗣，真嗣，真嗣。别这样，求你了。与你无关。绫波与初号机融合了。与你无关。停下来。是你造成的。去死吧，你这蠢小子！求你了。就让我睡吧。与你无关。救命。住手，你这小子！救救我。再见，真嗣。再见，真嗣。连站都站不稳？真可悲。救救我，谁来都行。再见，真嗣。轰！

The scream burned all the way down to his stomach and scorched his throat when he set it free. It tasted like bile and LCL, rancid and rotten just like the insides of his heart. The images would not stop; the pain would not abate no matter what he did. It was entirely his fault, wasn't it? All of it, even the loss of Units 02 and 08; he had fought against Asuka and Mari, caused the destruction of Asuka's EVA and nearly cost WILLE every asset they had, all according to his father's wishes. Strangely, the Fifth Angel's beam was burning his chest again, roasting his insides, cooking his organs inside his body, when he screamed again. His arm throbbed from the wrist up, and for a second he saw the Tenth Angel's beam separate it from his body in a clean, almost graceful slash.  
那声尖叫直烧到他的胃里，释放时灼伤了他的喉咙。它尝起来像胆汁和 LCL，腐臭而堕落，正如他内心的阴暗。那些画面挥之不去；无论他怎么做，痛苦都无法减轻。这一切都是他的错，不是吗？所有的一切，甚至包括 02 号和 08 号机体的损失；他与明日香和真希波对抗，导致了明日香 EVA 的毁灭，几乎让 WILLE 失去了所有资产，这一切都是遵从他父亲的意愿。奇怪的是，第五使徒的光束再次灼烧他的胸膛，炙烤他的内脏，将他的器官在体内烹煮，当他再次尖叫时。他的手臂从手腕开始抽痛，有那么一瞬间，他看到第十使徒的光束干净利落地将它从身体上切下，几乎带着一种优雅。

"STOOOOOOP! STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP, STOOOOP!"  
停！停，停，停，停，停！

Exhausted, Shinji could barely remember where he was, let alone that he was being watched. But it didn't matter anymore; the images would kill him, make him go insane unless he stopped it. His arm and guts throbbed again when the memory of the Tenth's tendril slashed through them, quick as lightning. Skulls, on the ground, skulls and bones all over. A dead figure smiling cruelly at him. Why? Why did it have Rei's haircut, his mother's haircut? What was so goddamn funny? Why was it so happy?  
筋疲力尽的 Shinji 几乎记不清自己身在何处，更别提意识到自己正被人监视。但这一切都不再重要；那些影像会置他于死地，逼他发疯，除非他停下来。当第十使徒的触手如闪电般划过他的手臂和内脏时，记忆再次令它们抽痛。地上的头骨，四处散落的骸骨。一具死尸残忍地对他微笑。为什么？为何它剪着 Rei 的发型，他母亲的发型？有什么该死的可笑之处？为何它如此开心？

"Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it…" Shinji unconsciously started hitting his head against the steel floor, hoping against hope he'd fall unconscious, that the pain would take away or at the very least dull the images and wretched feelings that contorted inside his chest. Red crosses huge as buildings dripping LCL, broken cities and devastated oceans, air unfit for anything remotely alive to breathe, red sand sodden with blood and ruins, so many ruins anywhere his gaze fell upon. All of this, in fourteen years? All of it, because of him? Bones, EVA bones, _human_ bones. A graveyard he had created, all with his own two hands. The screams of thousands, millions of souls in pain, dancing all around him as he began with Fourth Impact manifested. _**Goodbye, Shinji.**_  
“停下来，停下来，停下来，停下来……” 真嗣无意识地开始用头撞击钢制地板，抱着一丝希望自己能昏过去，希望疼痛能带走或至少减轻那些扭曲在他胸中的影像和痛苦感受。巨大的红色十字架如同建筑物般滴落着 LCL，破碎的城市和被毁的海洋，空气中充斥着对任何生命体都致命的成分，血染的红沙和废墟，他的目光所及之处尽是废墟。这一切，在十四年间？这一切，都是因为他？骨架，EVA 骨架，人类的骨头。他亲手创造的墓地。成千上万、数百万受苦灵魂的尖叫声，在他开始第四次冲击时围绕着他舞动。再见，真嗣。

He screamed again, managing to produce a half-screech and a series of coughs.  
他又尖叫起来，勉强发出半声嘶哑的尖叫和一连串咳嗽。

The memories and sensation of crushing Asuka and Unit 03 ran through him once again, forcing Shinji to hit himself harder, until his head started clearing to a degree and the images stopped torturing him with defiant consistency. Again and again the cold steel slammed against skin and bone, producing the first and only sound inside the small cell aside from Shinji's own screams in four days.  
记忆中碾压明日香和三号机的感受再次涌上心头，迫使真嗣更加用力地击打自己，直到他的头脑开始有所清醒，那些影像不再以挑衅般的持续性折磨他。一次又一次，冰冷的钢铁撞击着皮肤和骨骼，除了真嗣自己四天来的尖叫声外，这是狭小牢房里唯一的声音。

A warm liquid started flowing down his forehead, somehow smoothing out his thoughts. With a grip strong enough to pierce the skin of his scalp, his entire body clenched even tighter as his eyes refused to shut or function properly. The slow drip-drip of whatever was falling from his head helped Shinji regain his breathing and some sense of self-awareness. He stayed on the ground, breathing heavily through constricted lungs and trying to grasp where, exactly, he had begun to lose his mind.  
一股温热的液体从他的额头流下，不知怎的平复了他的思绪。他紧握头皮的手力足以刺穿皮肤，整个身体紧绷得更加厉害，而他的眼睛却无法闭合或正常工作。从他头上缓缓滴落的液体帮助真嗣恢复了呼吸和一些自我意识。他躺在地上，通过紧缩的肺部沉重地呼吸，试图抓住自己究竟是从何时开始失去理智的。

_WILLE,_ provided his overtired brain. _I'm in a cell, I'm alive._ After a few seconds, a bitterness far too great for him to ignore settled on his chest, making him feel empty and hollow. _I'm a prisoner. My friends are dead. The ones that aren't hate me. I almost destroyed the world again. Again. Kaworu is dead._ His lower lip started to tremble as he let himself flop down on the floor with his back to the cold steel wall and cried.  
“WILLE，疲惫至极的大脑给出了答案。我身处牢笼，我还活着。几秒钟后，一股过于强烈的苦涩感压在他的胸口，让他感到空虚而空洞。我是个囚犯。我的朋友们都死了。那些还活着的恨我。我差点再次毁灭了世界。又一次。渚薰已经死了。他的下唇开始颤抖，他任由自己瘫倒在冰冷的钢墙边，背靠着墙，哭泣起来。”

The tears burned behind his eyelids and felt as though they boiled when they descended down his chin. A sob escaped his parched throat and blossomed pathetically in the empty space, reminding him how alone he truly was. The warm liquid mingled with the tears. A faint thud started to press against the side of his skull he'd banged repeatedly on the ground, but it made little difference. The warm liquid eased his thoughts, the hot drips of tears and blood fell on the soft fabric of his shirt, soothing Shinji in ways he did not fully understand.  
泪水在他眼睑后灼烧，流下时仿佛沸腾了一般。一声呜咽从他干涸的喉咙中逃逸出来，在空旷的空间里可怜地回荡，提醒着他有多么孤独。温热的液体与泪水混合。一阵微弱的敲击声开始在他反复撞击地面的头侧颅骨上施压，但这几乎没什么影响。温热的液体舒缓了他的思绪，滚烫的泪滴与血滴落在柔软的衬衫面料上，以他未能完全理解的方式安抚着真嗣。

His mind had been a haze for the past few days. He tried remembering when he was brought into the cell, how the DSS Choker had found its way back to his throat, but nothing except fog greeted his tired brain. Misato, screaming at him, pointing her gun at him. Walking under something red, red sand. Something… also red. Asuka, pulling him out of the entry plug. Asuka, putting something on his back. Asuka, taking his hand and forcing him to walk. Dark, shadows everywhere, and Asuka sitting in front of a building.  
他的思绪在过去几天里一直是一片迷雾。他试图回忆自己何时被带进牢房，DSS 项圈是如何重新回到他的脖子上，但疲惫的大脑只迎来了一片朦胧。美里对他尖叫，用枪指着他。走在一片红色的沙地上。某物……也是红色的。明日香，将他从插入栓中拉出来。明日香，在他背上放了什么。明日香，握住他的手，强迫他前行。黑暗，四处都是阴影，明日香坐在一栋建筑前。

Shinji pressed a hand against his forehead and noticed how his palm was stained crimson afterwards.  
真嗣用手按住额头，注意到手掌随后染上了鲜红。

Sitting at a station, or something that had been a station. Asuka glaring down at him, the glistening lights of a car. A bed. Blue skies? Asuka, telling him he had no permission to die yet. Birds, dogs, people. Fresh air, for just a moment. Someone pushing him into the ship once more, red skies instead of blue. Misato, Rei, Ritsuko, all in a room. Then nothing, just fog. At some point in between the red outside the entry plug and the current bleeding on his forehead Shinji had lost any and all track of reality. Again. How many people could actually say they had almost blown up the whole world twice?  
坐在一个车站，或者曾经是车站的地方。明日香怒视着他，汽车闪烁的灯光。一张床。蓝天？明日香，告诉他还没有权利死去。鸟儿，狗，人们。新鲜的空气，仅此一刻。有人再次将他推入船中，红色的天空取代了蓝色。美里、绫波、律子，都在一个房间里。然后什么都没有，只有雾。在插入栓外的红色与额头上的流血之间，真嗣再次失去了对现实的任何把握。又有多少人能真正说自己两次差点炸毁了整个世界？

Still, he was alive. Alive, when Kaworu was dead, when Ayanami was dead, when Touji and Kensuke and Hikari were most likely dead, and probably every other classmate he'd ever set eyes upon had shared that fate. _Dead_. _Because of me. I killed them, just as much as father. I wrecked Asuka's EVA when I couldn't beat that Angel and save her. I climbed into that plug, nobody forced me. I took those spears, even when Kaworu was begging me not to._ Somehow, the image of Asuka's scowl came to mind, the eye-patch firmly in place. _What happened to your eye? You really are stupid, huh, Shinji?_  
尽管如此，他还活着。活着，当渚薰已死，当绫波已死，当铃原和关还有光很可能也死了，或许他曾见过的每一个同学都遭遇了同样的命运。死了。因为我。我杀了他们，正如父亲一样。我毁了明日香的 EVA，因为我无法打败那个使徒并救她。我爬进了那个插入栓，没人强迫我。我接住了那些长矛，即使渚薰恳求我不要。不知怎的，明日香皱眉的样子浮现在脑海中，眼罩牢牢地戴在脸上。你的眼睛怎么了？你真是愚蠢，对吧，真嗣？

Tears were still leaking from his eyes, but still a strained, choked laugh pierced through his throat. _That eye-patch is probably my fault too, isn't it? Isn't everything?_ Another laugh, and another; more small chortles easily mistaken for sobs escaped Shinji's chest without permission. _I mean, sure, never mind that I had never even_ _**seen**_ _an EVA before Father brought me into this hell. Sure, let's put the brat in the big giant robot and let him blow everything to hell, because apparently he's got a knack for that. Sure, ha ha. Ha, ha ha ha ha. I bet you're laughing too, aren't you, Mother?_  
泪水依旧从他眼中渗出，但喉间仍挤出一丝嘶哑的笑声。那只眼罩，大概也是我的错吧？一切不都是吗？又是一阵笑，再一阵；未经允许，更多细小的轻笑轻易被误认为呜咽，从真嗣胸中逸出。我是说，当然，别介意我之前从未见过 EVA，直到父亲把我带进这个地狱。当然，让这小鬼坐进巨型机器人里，让他把一切都炸上天，显然他在这方面颇有天赋。当然，哈哈。哈，哈哈哈哈哈。我猜你也在笑吧，妈妈？

Before darkness overtook his mind, Shinji remembered what Fuyutsuki had told him. It all made some weird, macabre sense in his mind; everything had been engineered just so he'd do what his father wanted him to do at a given point in time. A bloodied hand slapped the bruised skin of his forehead, driving a sharp needle of acute pain through his body, yet the weariness would not abate. Just as he was falling asleep, trying not to laugh and cry at the same time, Shinji wondered if that was how it felt to open the gate of madness and walk inside. The sound of his own twisted titters lulled him back into the darkness. For once, darkness was all that received him in the unconscious.  
在黑暗吞噬他的意识之前，真嗣记得冬月曾对他说过的话。这一切在他心中形成了一种怪异而病态的逻辑；每件事都是精心设计，只为让他按照父亲在特定时刻的意愿行事。一只沾满血迹的手掌拍在他额头淤青的皮肤上，尖锐的刺痛贯穿全身，然而疲惫感却未见消减。正当他即将入睡，试图忍住笑与泪时，真嗣想知道，这是否就是打开疯狂之门并踏入其中的感觉。他自己扭曲的笑声将他再次带回黑暗。这一次，黑暗成了他无意识中唯一的接纳者。

"Get up." 起来。

She disgustedly kicked him on the leg. He looked horrible; how was it possible to get so sickening in just a few days? A jagged cut on his wrist, courtesy of the cuffs _she_ had placed too tightly, was almost purple with infection; pus with a yellowish-white tinge was evident and _leaking_ repulsively from the wound. Even after it healed, the tissue had been damaged enough to leave a very nasty scar behind. His shirt, or rather the top part of his despondent gown, was dirty with snot and what she assumed was vomit from the rancid smell of it.  
她厌恶地踢了他一脚。他看起来糟糕透顶；怎么可能在短短几天内变得如此令人作呕？他手腕上有一道参差不齐的伤口，是她的手铐勒得太紧所致，伤口因感染而几乎呈紫色；脓液带着黄白色的痕迹明显地从伤口中流出，令人作呕。即便伤口愈合，受损的组织也足以留下一道非常难看的疤痕。他的衬衫，或者说他那件沮丧长袍的上半部分，沾满了鼻涕和呕吐物，从那股恶臭中她猜想是后者。

Asuka wrinkled her nose in distaste and kicked him again. "Get up."  
明日香皱着鼻子，露出厌恶的表情，又踢了他一脚。“起来。”

He did not rouse, did not even move. There were blackened stains around the gown's collar as well, a lump on the right side of his forehead, and a thin line of clotted blood running all the way down to his chin. The bruise was large and considerably ugly, but not bulging so she suspected no fracture behind the damaged skin. Something other than anger and disgust stirred in her chest, something she wasn't at all accustomed to feeling; something she despised nearly as much as she despised the figure slumped on the floor before her. The flicker of worry was extinguished just as soon as it manifested. He had no right to be on the receiving end of her concern, or at least she told herself as much.  
他并未苏醒，甚至一动未动。长袍领口周围有焦黑的污迹，右额有一块肿块，一道凝固的血迹从额头一直延伸到下巴。瘀伤面积大且相当难看，但并未肿胀，因此她推测受损的皮肤下并无骨折。她的心中涌起了一种既非愤怒也非厌恶的情绪，一种她极不习惯的感受；一种她几乎与眼前蜷缩在地板上的身影一样厌恶的情感。那丝担忧刚一浮现便被掐灭。他没有资格得到她的关心，至少她是这么告诉自己的。

The third kick was aimed at his left arm, where the grimy wound was. This time he actually twitched, eyes struggling to open. "Get up," she spat, revolted by the clear trails of tears on the boy's cheeks. "Get the hell up already, you stupid brat. I've got better things to do with my day."  
第三脚瞄准了他肮脏伤口所在的左臂。这次他真的抽搐了一下，眼睛挣扎着想要睁开。“起来，”她啐道，对男孩脸颊上清晰的泪痕感到厌恶。“快他妈起来，你这个蠢小子。我这一天还有更重要的事要做。”

Shinji registered pain in his wrist, hot, almost unbearable agony radiating off the place with the funny smell on his arm and was forced to open his eyes. Something… far away was talking, slurring words he was yet unable to comprehend. He struggled against the stickiness under his eyelids and the sudden feeling of nausea, rubbing at his eyes with the one available hand left to him. Red, black. A black cap, red legs, red hair. A small, twisted frown made its way to his exhausted features.  
真嗣感觉到手腕处传来剧痛，灼热难忍的痛苦从手臂上散发着怪异气味的地方辐射开来，迫使他睁开了眼睛。某个遥远的声音在说话，含糊不清的词语他还无法理解。他挣扎着对抗眼睑下的黏腻感和突如其来的恶心感，用唯一能用的手揉搓着眼睛。红色，黑色。一顶黑色帽子，红色的腿，红色的头发。一个微小的、扭曲的皱眉出现在他疲惫的脸上。

"Asuka…" he muttered, staring up at the single blue eye glaring down at his fallen form.  
“明日香…”他喃喃自语，抬头凝视着那只俯视着他倒下身躯的蓝色独眼。

"Good, you're up, and you can talk again. Great." Asuka knelt down and extended a hand to touch his forehead, but Shinji jerked his head away, as though she'd burn him with her touch. The Major growled low in her throat and grabbed him by the chin like she'd done after hauling his undeserving behind out of the Plug. "Stay still, brat. I need to see if you cracked your skull during your little hissy fit."  
好，你醒了，又能说话了。太好了。" 明日香蹲下身，伸手去摸他的额头，但真嗣猛地躲开了，仿佛她的触碰会烫伤他。少校低声咆哮，像是从插入栓里拽出他那不值得的后背之后那样，抓住他的下巴。"别动，小鬼。我得看看你那小脾气发作时有没有把脑袋磕坏。

A cold finger poked at the scalding place on his head, forcing a bolt of pain through his hazed mind. He tried to pry off the offending hand but was too weak, too tired to resist. In the end he clawed half-heatedly against her stronger arm, whimpering once more when her thumb found the lump on his forehead and _pressed_. He jerked his head away, making the entire room spin. Nausea shook him, but there was nothing in his stomach to throw out.  
一根冰冷的手指戳在他滚烫的头部，一阵剧痛穿透了他模糊的意识。他试图挣脱那只烦人的手，但太虚弱，太疲惫，无力抵抗。最终，他半心半意地在她更强壮的手臂上抓挠，当她的拇指找到他额头上的肿块并按压时，他又发出了一声呜咽。他再次猛地扭头，让整个房间都旋转起来。恶心感袭来，但他的胃里空空如也，什么也吐不出来。

"You didn't fracture it, good," Asuka muttered, ignoring the hand feebly attempting to grip her arm. He had a fever; not anything too concerning, but a fever nonetheless. His eyes looked sunken in, meaning he hadn't been sleeping at all ever since being pushed into the cell. His parched and dried up lips had cuts on their edges, where she assumed he had bitten hard enough to make the skin bleed. _Idiot's probably dehydrated and emaciated. Perfect. Just perfect._  
“还好没骨折，不错。”明日香喃喃自语，无视那只无力试图抓住她手臂的手。他发烧了，虽然不算太严重，但确实在发烧。他的眼睛深陷，说明自从被关进牢房后他就一直没睡过觉。干裂的嘴唇边缘有咬痕，她猜他咬得够狠以至于皮肤都出血了。这傻瓜估计脱水和消瘦得厉害。完美，真是太完美了。

Asuka's brow twitched again; despite her best efforts the annoying flicker lit up again. Something about the way he was letting himself rot away upset her beyond the girl's own understanding. Before she knew what she was doing, the Major hauled WILLE's top prisoner to his feet and dragged him to his miniature sink. The boy hadn't uttered a single word since saying her name, but he did whimper pathetically when she began scrubbing at the half-healed scab made of dried up pus and blood, his arm held securely in place under her armpit. Should he decide to try any sudden moves she did not approve of, her grip would allow her to snap his arm in two. "God," she remarked, face wrinkling in revulsion. The faintest pressure above his wrist made the milky substance explode to the surface. "This is disgusting. You're worse than a kid. At least a brat would've had the decency to wash this off. How long have you let this fester?"  
明日香眉头再次抽动；尽管她竭力克制，那恼人的闪烁还是再次亮起。他自暴自弃的样子让她心中涌起难以名状的烦躁。还未意识到自己在做什么，这位少校便将 WILLE 的头号囚犯拽起身，拖到他的迷你水槽前。自喊出她的名字后，少年未再发一言，但当她开始用力擦洗那半愈合、结着干涸脓血痂的伤口时，他可怜地呜咽了一声，手臂被她牢牢夹在腋下。若他胆敢做出任何她不认可的突然举动，她的握力足以将他的手臂折断。“天啊，”她皱着脸，露出厌恶之色。手腕上微弱的压力使得那乳白色物质瞬间迸发出来。“真恶心。你连个孩子都不如。至少小鬼还会自觉洗掉这玩意儿。你到底让这伤口溃烂多久了？”

No answer, not that she needed one. Five days; he'd been left in the cell for five days and already he was rotting like dried produce. A glance in the boy's direction let her see his eyes were still unfocused; he would twitch every now and then when a particularly hardened scab was scrubbed, but otherwise made no attempt to move or respond. The Major's limited patience thinned and disappeared. She grabbed a gauze pad from her pocket, poured water on it and began the sickening task of removing the pus and filth from the wound. The moment she actually began scrubbing with some strength behind it, Shinji started to react. After the first few rinses the white material was colored yellow and brown, so she took another one and continued, gaining momentum and strength. The boy tried in vain to pull his arm away, but he was too weakened to do anything else than tug weakly at her grip.  
没有回应，她并不需要。五天了；他被关在牢房里五天，已然像干货般腐烂。瞥向男孩，她看到他的眼神依旧涣散；每当擦到特别顽固的痂时，他会偶尔抽搐一下，除此之外毫无动静，也不作任何反应。少校有限的耐心逐渐耗尽。她从口袋里抓出一块纱布垫，倒上水，开始令人作呕的任务——清除伤口上的脓液和污垢。她一用力擦洗，真嗣便有了反应。前几次冲洗后，白色纱布染成了黄褐色，于是她又换了一块，继续擦洗，动作越来越有力。男孩徒劳地试图抽回手臂，但他太过虚弱，除了无力地拉扯她的手，别无他法。

The infection had gone deep; half the boy's forearm was swollen already, the skin around the wound was yellowish and purple, weeping pus with every tug and applied pressure on the area. It pissed Asuka off for some reason, making the Major scrub even harder, much more than necessary. Shinji tried to pull his arm free but she held him in place with ease. He whimpered, but never so much as asked her to stop, never spoke a word of complaint, never said a damn thing. It pissed her off even more.  
感染已经深入；男孩的前臂肿了一半，伤口周围的皮肉泛着黄紫，每拉扯或施压，脓液便渗出。不知为何，这让明日香感到恼火，使她更加用力地清洗，远超必要的程度。真嗣试图抽回手臂，但她轻松地固定住他。他呜咽着，却未曾要求她停下，未曾抱怨一句，未曾吐露半点不满。这让她更加恼火。

_This infection is nasty,_ she thought, enraged. _Any sane, normal human being would be screaming bloody murder by now._ She pressed on the cut hard, forcing any remaining pus out. To her relief, red blood began to flow afterwards. _What's with this stupid brat? What did they show him? What the hell happened to him after we fought?_  
这感染真棘手，她愤怒地想。任何理智正常的人此刻都会尖叫连连。她用力按压伤口，逼出残留的脓液。令她宽慰的是，随后鲜血开始流出。这蠢小子是怎么回事？他们给他看了什么？我们战斗后他究竟经历了什么？

The memory of her fight against the Third Child incensed her all the more; before she knew what she was doing her hand closed on the freshly-cleaned wound and _squeezed_. A pained groan and a muted scream escaped the boy's chest; Asuka's eyes narrowed. "That was for your stupid little act before. Maybe you'll think about it twice before you get in my way again, idiot. You're not supposed to hit girls, you know."  
她对战第三使徒的记忆愈发激怒了她；在她意识到自己在做什么之前，她的手已经紧紧抓住了那刚清洗过的伤口并用力挤压。男孩胸中发出痛苦的呻吟和压抑的尖叫；明日香的眼睛眯了起来。“这是对你之前愚蠢行为的惩罚。也许下次你再想妨碍我时会三思而后行，白痴。你知道的，你不该打女孩子的。”

He did not answer, so she continued with the task at hand. About five more minutes and three more gauze pads later, Asuka took out the spray she had procured from the Infirmary and turned to the boy. To her ever-growing disgust, tears were leaking from Shinji's dead, glassy eyes. "This is going to sting, brat," she said coldly. "A lot. Try not to piss your gown."  
他没有回答，于是她继续手头的工作。大约又过了五分钟，换了三块纱布后，明日香从医务室拿来的喷雾转向了男孩。令她愈发厌恶的是，泪水正从真嗣那死寂、呆滞的眼睛中流出。“这会很痛，小子，”她冷冷地说道，“非常痛。别把你的睡衣弄湿了。”

And so, she poured the mix of disinfectant, antibacterial and healing agents in and around the formerly infected area. Shinji tried to pry his arm away with more vigor, making her grit her teeth in irritation and elbow him in the forehead, close to where his fresh wound was located.  
于是，她将消毒剂、抗菌剂和愈合剂的混合物倾倒在曾经受感染的区域及其周围。真嗣试图更用力地挣脱手臂，这让她恼怒地咬紧牙关，用肘部猛击他的额头，就在他新伤口的附近。

"Stay still. Brat." she ordered, applying more pressure to his arm. A dark, nasty part of her wanted nothing less than to break the arm altogether, but Asuka forced herself to focus. Once the whole area had been covered in the spray and cleaned, she produced the healing cream Ritsuko had come up with, poured it generously around the purplish areas, and began wrapping the boy's wrist with gauze.  
“别动，小鬼。”她命令道，加大了按住他手臂的力度。她内心深处有个阴暗的念头，恨不得直接把他的手臂弄断，但明日香强迫自己集中注意力。待整个区域都被喷洒并清洁完毕后，她拿出了律子研发的愈合霜，慷慨地涂抹在紫色的伤痕周围，然后开始用纱布包裹男孩的手腕。

Her task finished, she let Shinji crumble into a heap of overtired limbs beside her. The Major pressed a button on the PDA resting inside her pocket, and the window used to feed their prisoner opened, revealing the same assortment of colorful pastes she was overly familiar with along with four protein bars.  
任务完成后，她任由真嗣在她身旁瘫成一团疲惫不堪的肢体。少校按下放在口袋里的 PDA 上的一个按钮，喂食囚犯的窗口随即打开，露出她早已见惯的一系列彩色糊状物和四根蛋白棒。

The idiot made no move to stand or reach for the tasteless gruel. He did not look up, did not raise his eyes from the floor. Something vicious stirred inside her that Asuka had long since forgotten, something she had left along with any memories of her childhood upon seeing Shinji so unresponsive. She hauled the boy back to his feet, almost ripping the gown he was covered in, and lightly slapped him across the face.  
那傻瓜一动不动，既不站起来也不去拿那无味的稀粥。他没有抬头，目光始终不曾从地板上移开。某种久违的恶意在她心中涌动，那是阿斯卡自童年记忆以来便已遗忘的感觉，如今看到真嗣如此无动于衷，那感觉又回来了。她将男孩拽回脚边，几乎撕裂了他身上的长袍，轻轻地扇了他一巴掌。

"You will wake up," she ordered. "You will eat, you will clean up after yourself and you will make yourself presentable, or so help me I'll-"  
你会醒来的，"她命令道。"你要吃饭，你要自己收拾干净，你要让自己看起来体面，否则我发誓我会——

"What?" Shinji interrupted. His eyes finally turned to her, cold and detached, with a strange form of dark humor dancing in them. A pain beyond her grasp, beyond her understanding, had scarred the boy's mind and taken away his fear of her, it seemed. "You'll kill me?"  
什么？" 真嗣打断了她。他的目光终于转向了她，冷漠而疏离，眼中跳动着一种诡异的黑色幽默。一种她无法触及、无法理解的痛苦，似乎已经给这个男孩的心灵留下了伤痕，夺走了他对她的恐惧。"你会杀了我吗？

Every thought, every single gear in the Major's head ground to a halt when Shinji spoke. There was no emotion in his eyes or voice, no anger, no sadness, nothing but cold resignation. He wanted it, _wished_ for it, _craved_ it. He was so broken there was nothing else inside him, just the wish to disappear.  
当真嗣开口时，少校脑海中的每一个念头、每一颗齿轮都戛然而止。他的眼神和声音中没有情感，没有愤怒，没有悲伤，只有冰冷的认命。他渴望，希望，渴求着。他如此破碎，内心空无一物，只剩下消失的愿望。

"I thought I wasn't allowed to die," he continued, staring straight through her. "Misato tried to kill me already, _you_ tried to kill me before."  
“我以为我不被允许死去，”他继续说道，目光直穿透她，“美里已经试图杀过我一次，你之前也试图杀过我。”

_I didn't!_ Asuka's mind answered, enraged, yet the words did not make it to her mouth. _I was trying to_ _**stop**_ _you, you insolent brat!_ It sounded hollow, for she knew that had it come down to it she would have taken Shinji's life, and probably her own not too long after.

Shinji's eyes never changed; the cold, penetrating frown felt as cold as ice, sending a shiver down her spine. "She tried to blow me to pieces so I wouldn't start another Impact, didn't she?" A chuckle, rusted and vacant, sprang from his throat. "She killed my best friend, my only friend, right before my eyes, thinking it was _me_ who she was going to kill." He shook his head in derision. "It was just like that time, when I couldn't save you… I just sat there and listened as Unit 01 tore you to pieces. It was… it was like that time."  
真嗣的眼神从未改变；那冰冷、穿透的皱眉如同寒冰般刺骨，让她脊背发凉。“她试图将我炸成碎片，以免我引发另一次冲击，对吧？”一声生锈而空洞的轻笑从他喉咙里蹦出。“她在我眼前杀了我最好的朋友，我唯一的朋友，以为要杀的是我。”他轻蔑地摇了摇头。“就像那次一样，我没能救你……我只能坐在那里，听着初号机将你撕成碎片。那感觉……就像那次一样。”

Her hands started to shake, unconsciously letting go of his gown when the boy's own palm slapped himself on the forehead. "That's all I'm ever good at… letting people die, hurting them, killing them… that's all my father ever wanted of me…" The Major's shocked blue eyes widened when Shinji started laughing softly. "So why don't you beat me up some more?" he asked, smiling. "Why doesn't the crew take turns? Isn't that what you want? Revenge against the guy who took everything away from you? Revenge against the guy who took your eye? So do it… get it over with... Ma... Major... do it..."  
她的手开始颤抖，当男孩自己一掌拍在额头上时，她无意识地放开了他的长袍。“我只会……让人死去，伤害他们，杀死他们……那是我父亲一直想要的……”当真嗣开始轻声笑起来时，少校震惊的蓝眼睛瞪大了。“那你为什么不继续打我？”他笑着问。“为什么不轮流来？这不是你们想要的吗？对夺走你一切的人的复仇？对夺走你眼睛的人的复仇？那就来吧……快点结束吧……少校……动手吧……”

His other hand sprang up, obscuring his eyes as he grabbed and pushed at his scalp, scratching the skin underneath with urgency. The shock had passed, it would seem, and reality was returning to him in droplets; the agony stored in the brat's chest had come to a boiling point after being completely isolated for five days.  
他另一只手猛地抬起，遮住双眼，急切地抓挠头皮，用力到几乎要抓破下面的皮肤。震惊似乎已经过去，现实正以点滴的形式回归他的意识；那孩子胸中的痛苦在被完全隔离五天后，已达到了沸点。

Asuka saw, unaware of the slight shine of surprise in her eyes, as Shinji's fingernails dug deep into his own skin, only to scratch the sides of his face when they came down and grabbed her by the shoulders with a force he was not supposed to possess.  
明日香看到了这一幕，未察觉自己眼中闪过的一丝惊讶，只见真嗣的指甲深深陷入自己的皮肤，待到指甲落下时，他已用一种不该有的力量抓住了她的肩膀。

"Do it!" he screamed right at her face, forehead bleeding anew. "Do it, do it, do it! Kill me! Never mind that I had never seen an EVA before, never mind that I didn't know what I was doing! Just do it already! Give me my permission already! KILL ME!"  
“动手吧！”他对着她的脸尖叫，额头上的血再次渗出。“动手，动手，动手！杀了我！别管我以前从未见过 EVA，别管我不知道自己在做什么！快动手！给我个痛快！杀了我！”

SLAP 啪的一声

He fell hard against the ground, so hard his back bounced off the metal wall, and Asuka had to actively stop herself from kicking him again once he dropped to the floor. Her eye started twitching beyond her control, her breathing constricted, her mind turned to a haze; so she took a swing at the wall and felt it dent under her strength. Fourteen years of caged up anger and sorrow threatened to be unleashed upon the one boy she had ever felt close to, but she forced her eye closed and took a deep breath. She could not do it; not when Four Eyes was watching through the camera feed, ready to taunt her with her twisted actions and make her feel guilty.  
他重重地摔在地上，背部猛地撞上金属墙，阿斯卡不得不强忍住再次踢他的冲动，当他倒地时。她的眼皮开始不由自主地跳动，呼吸变得急促，思绪陷入一片迷雾；于是她挥拳击向墙壁，感受到它在她的力量下凹陷。十四年积压的愤怒与悲伤眼看就要倾泻在这个她曾感到亲近的男孩身上，但她强迫自己闭上眼睛，深吸一口气。她不能这么做；当四眼通过摄像头监视着，准备用她扭曲的行为嘲弄她，让她感到内疚时，她不能这么做。

"You…" she muttered, fists shaking. "You'd like that, wouldn't you? Just stay still, wait for it and then disappear, just like that, whenever Misato's had enough of you. Just taunt me or anyone else on this ship until they give you what you want, is that it?" She grabbed a fistful of his hair, matted and dried as it was, and forced his cold eyes to stare right into hers. "You're just being a brat. You think I don't know what happened to you? Do you really take me for an idiot?!" Her hand tightened around his scalp.  
“你……”她低声咒骂，拳头颤抖。“你一定很享受吧，不是吗？就那样静静等待，然后消失，只要美里对你厌倦了。就那样嘲弄这艘船上的我或其他任何人，直到他们给你想要的东西，是这样吗？”她抓起他一撮纠结干枯的头发，强迫他冰冷的眼睛直视她的。“你只是在耍小孩子脾气。你以为我不知道你经历了什么吗？你真的把我当傻瓜吗？！”她的手紧紧抓住他的头皮。

"I've had fourteen years to think about all this, fourteen years, _Baka_-Shinji." The sound of her pet-name for him made Shinji stare at her with some sense behind his eyes for the first time. "Don't insult my intellect by thinking I'm blaming all this… hell… on you. You were a kid, just… just a kid wanting to save his sweetheart. Misato was cheering you on, I _heard_." Hearing the words leave her mouth made the Major realize, for the first time in fourteen years, that Shinji had not been trained to be a pilot since he was a toddler, had not been introduced to the curse of EVA until it was beneficial for his father that it happen. Even so, the jealousy bit away at her psyche without reprieve.  
"我已经花了十四年时间来思考这一切，十四年，笨蛋真嗣。" 她对他的昵称让真嗣第一次用些许理智的眼神盯着她。"别以为我会怪罪你……该死……这一切。你那时只是个孩子，只是……一个想要拯救心上人的孩子。美里还在为你加油，我听说了。" 当这些话从她口中说出时，这位少校才第一次意识到，十四年来，真嗣并非从小就被训练成驾驶员，直到对他父亲有利时才被引入 EVA 的诅咒。即便如此，嫉妒仍无情地啃噬着她的心灵。

Shinji's eyes widened even more at her statement. "You didn't know what would happen, back then. You wanted to save Ayanami…" _But not me,_ her mind whispered, full of spite; but then the sight of his weakened frame quelled the more dangerous edges of her wrath. "But you failed," she said instead. "And now you're acting like a lost child, just sitting around, waiting to die. Real men fight, real men don't just quit."  
真嗣听到她的话，眼睛瞪得更大了。"那时你不知道会发生什么。你想救绫波……" 但不是我，她的内心充满怨恨地低语；然而看到他虚弱的身躯，她愤怒的锋芒稍稍平息。"但你失败了，"她改口道。"现在你却像个迷路的孩子，只是坐着等死。真正的男人会战斗，真正的男人不会轻易放弃。"

"I'm not a man," Shinji answered, looking miserable and defeated. "I'm a monster."  
“我不是人，”真嗣回答，神情痛苦而颓丧。“我是怪物。”

SLAP 啪的一声

She had not planned to hit him again, but to hear Shinji compare himself to a monster, a beast like her, made Asuka want to rip out his hair and smack him around the head until he came back to his senses. He knew nothing of monsters, knew nothing yet of what she had become.  
她本没打算再打他，但听到真嗣将自己比作怪物，像她一样的野兽，阿斯卡便想扯掉他的头发，狠狠地扇他的头，直到他清醒过来。他对怪物一无所知，对她的转变也一无所知。

"You don't get to call yourself that," she retorted, grabbing his chin again. She crouched down and held his head firmly between her hands, glaring down. "Your father's a monster, Fuyutsuki's a monster, **we're** monsters, but you…" The ugly stirring in her chest boiled with unwanted emotion. The deranged haze washed off his eyes when she spoke, and for the first time in fourteen years Asuka saw him again, the real him. _Baka- Shinji._ "You're a brat, an idiot, and a man. Men fight. If you want your permission, you have to earn it. You have to fight for your redemption, Baka."  
“你没资格这么称呼自己，”她反驳道，再次抓住他的下巴。她蹲下身，双手紧紧捧住他的头，目光凌厉地俯视着他。“你父亲是怪物，冬月是怪物，我们是怪物，但你……”她胸中那股丑陋的骚动因不想要的情绪而沸腾。当她说话时，他眼中那疯狂的迷雾消散了，十四年来，阿斯卡第一次看到了真正的他，那个真实的他。笨蛋——真嗣。“你是个孩子，是个傻瓜，也是个男人。男人会战斗。如果你想得到许可，你必须争取。你必须为你的救赎而战，笨蛋。”

"Re… redemption?" Shinji mumbled, staring at her. He remembered, in a dark, dormant side of his mind, just how beautiful he found Asuka to be, the unattainable beauty he had admired from afar since the first time he had laid eyes on her.  
“赎…赎回？” 真嗣喃喃道，凝视着她。在他内心深处一个阴暗沉寂的角落，他记得自己曾多么觉得明日香美丽动人，那种遥不可及的美，自他第一次见到她起就暗自仰慕。

"That's what your stupid song is about. Don't you know that already?" Asuka snapped, looking him straight in the eye. A part of her, most of her really, wanted to hit him again for good measure, but Asuka could not bring herself to hurt him. Whatever he had seen during his little stunt, whatever his father had done to him during his brief stay at NERV, had scarred him far more than any physical or psychological damage she could bring about. "It's about a group of people who were taking from their home into a hellish place and forced to live as slaves. The only thing that kept them going were the songs they carried with them. When the time came for them to fight for their freedom, they did. They got their redemption. What would be redemption for you?"  
“你那首愚蠢的歌讲的就是这个。你不是早就知道了吗？” 明日香厉声说道，直视着他的眼睛。她内心深处，或者说大部分的她，真想再揍他一顿以泄愤，但明日香无法让自己伤害他。无论他在那次小把戏中看到了什么，无论他父亲在他短暂逗留 NERV 期间对他做了什么，都给他留下了比任何身体或心理伤害更深的创伤。“这首歌讲述了一群人被从家乡掳到一个地狱般的地方，被迫沦为奴隶。唯一支撑他们活下去的，是他们随身携带的歌曲。当他们为自由而战的时候，他们做到了。他们获得了救赎。对你来说，什么是救赎呢？”

"You," Shinji answered almost mechanically, surprising Asuka and making her blink. "For you to forgive me. I… if I could… if I could make it up to you… t-to everyone… for… everything…" He trailed off lamely, looking at the ground in shame.  
"你，" 真嗣几乎是机械地回答，这让明日香感到惊讶，她眨了眨眼。"为了你能原谅我。我……如果我能……如果我能弥补你……给每个人……为了……一切……" 他无力地停了下来，羞愧地看着地面。

"You can't." 你做不到。

It stung, for some reason, to crush his one hope for sanity and forgiveness so quickly, and yet the words left her mouth without Asuka even noticing it. "There's nothing you can ever do to rebuild the world. Nothing, unless you mean to restart it again with another freaking Impact. You saw what wanting something like that brought, you almost killed us all again. Hey," She shook him to distract herself from his broken gaze. "It's the truth."  
不知为何，如此迅速地粉碎他仅存的理智与宽恕的希望，让她感到一阵刺痛，然而这些话却自然而然地从明日香口中流出，她甚至未曾察觉。“你永远无法重建这个世界，什么也做不了，除非你打算再次引发那该死的冲击来重启一切。你见识过那种渴望带来的后果，差点又让我们所有人丧命。嘿，”她摇晃着他，以转移自己对上他破碎目光的注意力。“这是事实。”

He looked destroyed, at the brink of insanity, and yet Asuka did not stop. "You can't fix it, but you can do _something_."  
他看上去已濒临崩溃，几近疯狂，但明日香并未就此罢休。“你无法修复它，但你可以做些什么。”

"Why?" he interrupted, staring into her eye with dread. "Why won't you kill me? Why didn't you just leave me to rot in the entry plug? If I can't change anything… then… w-why?"  
“为什么？”他打断道，惊恐地凝视着她的眼睛。“你为什么不杀了我？你为什么不让我在插入栓里腐烂？如果我什么都改变不了……那么……为-为什么？”

Her stare became physically painful for Shinji. Asuka now only looked at him with her eye filled with hate, ever since waking up in this new, twisted reality he was forced to live in. Both her hands roughly grabbed him by the jaw, lifting his head so he was close enough to feel and smell her breath, close enough to see the dark ring under her visible eye and the bluish glow under the patch.  
她的凝视对真嗣来说变得肉体上难以承受。自从在这个被迫生活的新扭曲现实中醒来后，明日香现在只用充满恨意的眼睛看着他。她用双手粗暴地抓住他的下巴，抬起他的头，让他近到能感受到和闻到她的呼吸，近到能看到她可见眼睛下的黑眼圈和眼罩下的蓝光。

"You don't fear death, do you?" Asuka asked, quietly enough for Shinji to feel actual fear crawl down his spine. She snarled, looking almost animalistic; if her screams had once bothered him, her monotone was starting to terrify him. "You welcome it, you _want_ to die. You want to disappear, then nobody will be able to hold you accountable for anything anymore."  
“你不怕死，对吧？”明日香问道，声音轻得让真嗣感到真正的恐惧沿着脊椎爬升。她咆哮着，看起来几乎像野兽一般；如果她曾经的尖叫曾让他困扰，那么她现在的单调语气开始让他感到恐惧。“你欢迎死亡，你想死。你想消失，这样就没人能再追究你任何事了。”

She pushed him back onto the mattress and tossed the book next to him, glaring with disgust evident in her gaze even when Shinji's widened eyes made contact with hers. "Your punishment must be more severe."  
她将他推回到床垫上，把书扔在他旁边，即使真嗣睁大的眼睛与她对视时，她眼中的厌恶依然明显。“你的惩罚必须更严厉。”

With a glare and a slight huff, Asuka stood and headed for the food rations. "You'll live, and you'll come face to face with all you've done. You'll suffer, you'll be alone, but you will endure. You will push forward. And when I say so, after you've done enough by _my_ standards and nobody else's, _then_ you can die. I'll do it myself if you want."  
阿斯克以一记怒视和轻微的哼声站起身，朝食物配给走去。“你会活下去，直面你所做的一切。你会受苦，你会孤独，但你将坚持下去。你会继续前行。当我这么说时，在你按照我的标准做了足够多的事情——而不是其他任何人的标准——之后，你才可以死。如果你愿意，我会亲自送你一程。”

Shinji lay sprawled on the mattress, staring at the back of her jacket with something akin to detached disbelief and dread. His earlier outburst came to mind, making him feel slightly ashamed and sickened. The disconnect was still there; reality was still very much foggy and difficult to assimilate. His eyes drifted to the bandages now decorating his wrist and forearm. The sting had been horrible, almost indescribable and yet he had barely moved at all; the deeper the pain became, the closer he was to waking up.  
真嗣四肢摊开躺在床垫上，凝视着她夹克的后背，心中涌起一种近乎冷漠的难以置信和恐惧。他早先的爆发浮现在脑海，让他感到些许羞愧和恶心。那种脱节依然存在；现实依旧模糊不清，难以融入。他的目光飘向此刻装饰在他手腕和前臂上的绷带。那种刺痛感极其可怕，几乎无法形容，然而他几乎一动未动；疼痛越深，他就越接近醒来。

"You won't starve yourself, either." The sudden sound of her voice made Shinji blink and tiredly look over to where she stood a few feet away, protein bar in hand. "You will eat. Now take this, and eat."  
“你也不会让自己饿着的。”她突然出声，让真嗣眨了眨眼，疲惫地转向她站立的几英尺外，手里拿着蛋白棒。“你会吃的。现在拿着这个，吃吧。”

Somehow he became more alert when the small package was pushed in his direction, yet he was too tired to actually lift his hand and grab it. He stared at it instead, feeling defeated and nauseated, hoping against hope that Asuka would get bored and leave him to rot in peace in the solace of the little cage they had thrown him in. "I'm… not hungry…" Shinji managed to whisper.  
不知为何，当这个小包裹被推向他时，他变得更加警觉，然而他太累了，根本抬不起手去拿。他只是盯着它，感到挫败和恶心，心中暗暗希望明日香会感到无聊，让他在这被抛入的小小牢笼中安静地腐烂。“我……不饿……”真嗣勉强低声说道。

Even when he could not see it, he actively felt the Major's eye stare death into him. "If you don't eat for yourself, I'll make you eat. Believe that. Now take this." The distance was reduced even more; Asuka was now pushing the wrapped package against his face. "Come on, you damn brat. Just take it, already."  
即使看不见，他也能真切感受到玛吉尔少校的目光如利刃般刺向他。“如果你不为自己吃，我会逼你吃。相信这一点。现在拿着这个。”距离更近了；明日香将包裹好的食物推到他脸上。“快点，你这该死的小鬼。赶紧拿去。”

"Not…" The very notion of eating made his stomach lurch in discontent and growl in desperation all at once. "Hungry…" Bones, everywhere, red sand, stained with the blood he had spilled, monstrous arms reaching into the skies, crimson everywhere he looked. Even now, in front of him, Asuka's crimson plugsuit allowed no escape from the memories. When the food was all but slapped against his cheek, Shinji shook his head with whatever meager energy still available in his body.  
“不……”一想到吃东西，他的胃就翻腾着不满，同时又因绝望而咕咕作响。“饿……”到处都是骨头，红色的沙子，沾满了他所流的血，怪物般的手臂伸向天空，放眼望去尽是猩红。即便此刻，在他面前，明日香那鲜红的驾驶服也无法让他从记忆中逃脱。当食物几乎被拍打到他的脸颊时，真嗣用身体里仅存的那点微弱力气摇了摇头。

The sound of Asuka teeth grinding in frustration reverberated in the small cell. She huffed in annoyance, peeled the wrapper off the protein bar and pushed it against Shinji's closed lips. "Stop being an idiot for once. Eat." The rage was dwindling once again; she did her best to reignite it by remembering the last battle. "I said _eat_, goddamn you."  
明日香因沮丧而咬牙切齿的声音在小牢房里回荡。她恼怒地哼了一声，剥开蛋白棒的包装纸，用力抵在真嗣紧闭的唇上。“别再犯傻了，吃吧。”怒火再次消退；她尽力通过回忆上一场战斗来重新点燃它。“我说了吃，该死的。”

Instead of being a good boy and opening his mouth, Shinji turned away his head and let it hang; he was so tired. Of all the things he wanted to do, such as dying, disappearing or being granted a magic wish or way to remedy his wrongdoings, eating was the least of his concerns. He felt unworthy of food or drink.  
真嗣并没有乖乖张嘴，反而转过头去，任由脑袋垂下；他实在太累了。在所有他想做的事情中，比如死去、消失或被赐予一个魔法愿望或方法来弥补他的过错，吃饭是最不重要的。他觉得自己不配吃喝。

"Fine. Have it your way." The protein bar crashed against the steel floor and broke into smaller pieces. In a quick move Asuka grabbed a fistful of the paste with her right hand, and picked his head up by the hair with her left. "Open up. I will push this food down your throat if I have to." Despite the apparent rage clouding her every action, Asuka noticed her hands shaking. She had already slapped him without meaning to; for some reason the realization sent a pang of despair into her damaged heart. "Open your damn mouth. Now."  
好吧，随你便。"蛋白棒猛地砸在钢制地板上，碎成了更小的碎片。阿斯卡迅速用右手抓起一把糊状物，左手揪住他的头发将他的头抬起。"张开嘴。必要的话，我会把这食物硬塞进你喉咙。"尽管愤怒充斥着她的每一个动作，阿斯卡注意到自己的手在颤抖。她已经无意中扇了他一巴掌；不知为何，这个念头让她的心痛上加痛，涌上一股绝望。"张开你的臭嘴。现在。

The ringing in her ears did not allow her to hear how her own voice shook along with her hands. Had Shinji not been so exhausted, she would have most likely had to shove him to the ground. In the state he was currently in, having close to no sleep for days, without eating and barely drinking, he was all but dead on his feet. Even so, he stubbornly held his mouth closed. _Goddamn it,_ she thought, sickened. _God damn you, Baka-Shinji._ She let go of his head, threw a lazy punch to his gut, and as his air was momentarily pushed out of him she grabbed his head again and shoved the gruel down his throat before he could react.  
耳鸣让她听不清自己的声音也在和双手一起颤抖。如果不是新司如此疲惫，她很可能不得不把他推倒在地。连续几天几乎没睡，不吃不喝，他几乎已经筋疲力尽。即便如此，他还是固执地紧闭着嘴。该死，她想，感到恶心。该死，笨蛋新司。她松开他的头，懒洋洋地朝他的腹部打了一拳，趁他一时喘不过气来，再次抓住他的头，将粥糊强行塞进他的喉咙，不给他反应的机会。

He was about to spit or cough the food out, but her hands held his jaw closed. "Chew," She ordered, voice breaking at the end. Her eye was twitching, _itching_; she wanted to scratch away at it. The hollowness in her chest evolved into agony. "Do it." For some reason she did not yet understand her walls came down for a fraction of a second. "Please."  
他正要吐出或咳出食物，但她的手紧紧按住了他的下巴。“嚼，”她命令道，声音在末尾颤抖。她的眼皮在跳动，发痒；她想抓挠。她胸中的空虚感转化为剧痛。“做吧。”出于某种她尚未理解的原因，她的防线在那一瞬间瓦解了。“求你了。”

Shinji's eyes widened somewhat and at last she felt the boy's jaw move on its own. She took a step back, breathing heavily, chest burning, and finally managed to push a gloved knuckle into her eye to erase the unnatural sting. The idiot coughed in between bites, even when the paste did not need to be chewed at all, the sensation of chewing allowed him to successfully consume whatever Asuka had just pushed into his mouth.  
真嗣的眼睛微微睁大，终于，她感觉到男孩的下巴自行动了动。她后退一步，呼吸急促，胸口灼热，最终用戴着手套的指节揉进眼中，消除了那不自然的刺痛感。那傻瓜在吞咽间咳嗽，即使那糊状物根本不需要咀嚼，仅仅是咀嚼的感觉就让他成功咽下了明日香刚刚塞进他嘴里的东西。

His stomach grumbled, loudly. He was suddenly very thirsty and very hungry.  
他的肚子咕噜作响，声音很大。他突然感到非常口渴，也非常饥饿。

"I'm about to jam a second serving down your damn throat if you don't do it for yourself. There's water to your left. Drink it, and start eating." The command came out half-bitten, clipped; it took all of her effort to keep her voice from wavering; there was a sickness growing in her belly now.  
“如果你不自己动手，我马上就给你塞第二份。左边有水，喝掉，然后开始吃。”命令半咬着牙，语气急促；她竭尽全力不让声音颤抖；此刻她的胃里正滋生着一种不适。

Something akin to slight relief began to blossom in her ribcage when Shinji dragged the tray of food closer to him and began to slowly eat. She stood there, glaring, watching as every bit of the gruel disappeared. Shinji was quick to grab one of the protein bars and push it into his mouth, chewing with more urgency as he went along. "Slow down or you'll make yourself sick, you idiot. The food's not going anywhere."  
当真嗣将餐盘拉近自己并开始缓慢进食时，她胸腔中仿佛绽开了一丝轻微的释然。她站在那里，目光锐利地盯着每一口稀粥消失。真嗣迅速抓起一块蛋白棒塞进嘴里，随着咀嚼的加快，他的动作更显急切。“慢点吃，不然你会把自己噎着的，笨蛋。食物又不会跑掉。”

A slight nod, and the devouring continued until not a single protein bar remained. She almost snickered at the way Shinji placed everything in a neat pile and tried to get up so as to leave it by the cell door. A hand pushed him back to the bed while the other retrieved the tray. "You'll fall flat on your damn face. Stay there, you idiot."  
他微微点头，继续狼吞虎咽，直到最后一根蛋白棒也被消灭殆尽。她几乎要笑出声来，看着真嗣将所有东西整齐地堆成一堆，试图起身将其放在牢房门口。一只手将他推回床上，另一只手则取走了餐盘。“你会摔个狗吃屎的。老实待着，笨蛋。”

With her senses returning to something more familiar, Asuka breathed in once her back was to Shinji and began to walk away. "It's been decided that keeping you in here is a waste of resources better spent on the crew. We'll be dropped off in a day and a half, in a secure location, while Unit 02 goes through repairs." Her one blue eye glared accusingly at him. "Repairs that would not be necessary… were it not for your little act out there."  
当她的感官逐渐恢复到更为熟悉的状态时，明日香在背对真嗣后深吸了一口气，开始走开。“已经决定把你留在这里是浪费资源，这些资源本应更好地用于船员。我们将在一天半后被送到一个安全地点，而二号机则进行维修。”她那只蓝色的眼睛责备地瞪着他。“这些维修本不必要的……如果不是因为你在外面的小动作。”

_What am I doing?_ Asuka wondered for a moment as Shinji's body curled into itself and he nodded his guilt at her. _Why am I here? Why did I give him that dictionary? Why did I just…_ She had forced food down his throat and ensured he did not starve to death for another day or so. Why? Nobody had ordered her to do so. Misato was too busy to even remember Shinji had not been eating at all. Four Eyes had been pestering her about it, about how her mood darkened as days went by and the Third Child wasted away in the cell. _Nonsense. Whatever was there died years ago, didn't it? Didn't it?_  
我在做什么？明日香一时疑惑，看着真嗣蜷缩起身体，向她点头承认自己的过错。我为何在此？为何要给他那本词典？为何我刚刚……她强迫他吃下食物，确保他不会在接下来的日子里饿死。为何？没有人命令她这么做。美里忙得连真嗣一直没吃东西都忘了。四眼一直在烦她，说随着日子一天天过去，她的情绪越来越阴沉，而第三适格者却在牢房里日渐消瘦。胡说八道。无论那里曾经有什么，早在几年前就死了，不是吗？不是吗？

"I marked the pages where you'll find the meaning to those stupid little words you kept mumbling." Her hands rummaged through both jacket pockets and threw two small packages onto the boy's bed. "Toothpaste, and a toothbrush. Soap," She explained as she pointed at each one. "You'll shower and change. We'll be leaving the vessel soon enough, and you stink of puke and God knows what else." Her eye narrowed at the bandage applied to his left arm. "You're an idiot for letting that fester." _Never mind the fact that it was me putting those cuffs on too tightly that..._  
“我在那些页码上做了标记，你可以找到那些你一直嘟囔的愚蠢小词的含义。”她双手在夹克口袋里翻找，将两个小包裹扔到男孩的床上。“牙膏，还有牙刷。肥皂。”她指着每一样解释道。“你去洗个澡，换身衣服。我们很快就要离开这艘船了，你浑身都是呕吐物和其他不知什么东西的臭味。”她盯着他左臂上的绷带，眼神变得锐利。“你真是个白痴，让伤口溃烂。”别提那是因为我把手铐扣得太紧了……

"Where…" came the weak reply from the bed. "Where are… am I to be… in another cage…?"  
“哪里……”床上传来虚弱的回答。“我要被带到……另一个笼子里吗……？”

"No need." Asuka was now facing the door; the final battle was drawing near, she could feel it more than she felt most of her body lately. She was no longer human, after all, not entirely. The spot under her eyepatch ached. "You're not a threat to anyone without Unit 01, and Misato can blow your head off whenever she pleases."  
“不用了。”明日香此刻正对着门；最终的战斗即将来临，她能感觉到这一点，比她最近能感受到自己身体的其他部分还要强烈。毕竟，她已不再完全算是人类。眼罩下的那块皮肤隐隐作痛。“没有初号机，你对任何人都不构成威胁，而且美里随时可以一枪打爆你的头。”

"Then… where are we… going?" Shinji inquired, already half asleep; perhaps with a full stomach he'd be able to sleep a few hours unperturbed. His vision swam in and out of focus, then suddenly a smaller package impacted against his chest. He gingerly picked up the object and felt his eyes widen in shock. Batteries; the specific type of batteries his SDAT used. To his right rested the dictionary, as well.  
“那么……我们要去哪里？”真嗣问道，已经半睡半醒；也许吃饱了肚子，他就能不受打扰地睡上几个小时。他的视线时而模糊时而清晰，突然一个小包裹撞到了他的胸口。他小心翼翼地捡起那个物体，眼睛因震惊而睁大。电池；正是他的 SDAT 所用的那种电池。在他右边，字典也静静地躺着。

The door hissed open. "To a place where the sky is blue. You've been there before, very briefly. If you don't shower I will literally hose you down, understood?" Her uncovered eye turned to glare at him. Shinji nodded from his place on the bed; he was almost falling to the side. Still, he nodded, not really looking at her. "Go back to listening to your little song, then. Maybe you'll learn something."  
门嘶的一声开了。“去一个蓝天的地方。你曾去过那里，虽然很短暂。如果你不洗澡，我真会用水管冲你，明白吗？”她露出的眼睛转向他，怒目而视。真嗣在床上点了点头，身子几乎要侧倒。尽管如此，他还是点了点头，并没有真正看她。“那就继续听你的小曲吧。或许你能学到点什么。”

The door hissed closed. 门嘶的一声关上了。

His fingers fidgeting with the batteries, Shinji stared at them in a strange sense of disbelief. Asuka's voice… had he heard it correctly? Why had it wavered so much at some point? Why had she bothered to bring so many things to him, and how come she had told him to go back to his SDAT? She obviously knew of the song and its significance; and now had given an order to him and forced him to realize she was right. Death was too good for him, after all, at least at this point in time. Perhaps, if he worked at it, if he tried to move in some direction that was, for once, not dictated to him by someone else, then he would get his permission. A notion such as him finding a way to repair the damage he had perpetrated was laughable, but Asuka had been quite emphatic in her desires and expectations.  
他的手指不安地摆弄着电池，真嗣盯着它们，心中涌起一种奇怪的难以置信感。明日香的声音……他听对了吗？为什么在某一刻她的声音如此颤抖？她为何费心带这么多东西给他，又为何让他回到他的 SDAT 播放器前？她显然知道那首歌及其重要性；而现在她下达了命令，迫使他意识到她是对的。死亡对他来说都太过仁慈，至少在此时此刻。或许，如果他努力尝试，如果他试图朝着一个方向前进，这个方向不是别人强加给他的，那么他就能获得许可。像他这样找到修复自己造成的损害的方法的想法虽然可笑，但明日香在她的愿望和期望上却相当坚决。

What was next? Were they going to tell him to get in the EVA and fight, at some point? Would he do it?  
接下来是什么？他们会在某个时候命令他进入 EVA 战斗吗？他会这么做吗？

The batteries were put into the SDAT; he rewound the tape, placed the buds in his ears and pressed play. Shinji's head hit the mattress at last; his eyes closed and, under the lulling melody of the song, he drifted into a dreamless slumber. _I really need to look at that dictionary, and… thank Asuka…_ was the last thought that went through his head before sleep claimed him.  
电池被装入了 SDAT；他倒带，将耳塞放入耳中，按下播放键。真嗣的头终于靠在了床垫上；双眼闭合，在歌曲的舒缓旋律下，他渐渐沉入了无梦的睡眠。我真的需要查查那本词典，还有……感谢明日香……这是他在睡意袭来前最后的念头。

Redemption. He wondered if it was possible to attain, even for someone like him.  
救赎。他思索着，像他这样的人是否有可能获得。

_**TBC**_… 待续…

_AN: Shinji dieded? And yes I misspelled that on purpose. I don't fucking know. Wait for more chappies to find out!  
作者注：真嗣死了？是的，我故意拼错的。我他妈也不知道。等着看更多章节揭晓吧！_

_Yo! So… this has been sorta sitting in an old computer for years, so I thought fuck it, dust it off, revise and get it out. Imma wait a bit more until I get a proper look at the last movie to sorta make a mental map of where I want this story to go, but if everything goes well it shouldn't suck as much as the last movies. Hopefully. Oh, and I just wanna say… I fucking predicted the force feeding. This shit has existed as it is for years. It was weird. Feels weird. Whatever. Aight so hate? Love? Like? Should I just let this shit collect more dust? Lemme know. Love to you all, and thank you so much for reading!  
哟！所以……这东西在旧电脑里躺了好几年，我想着管它呢，掸掸灰，改改，发出来得了。我打算再等等，看完最后一部电影，好在大脑里勾勒出我想让这个故事发展的方向，但如果一切顺利的话，它应该不会像前几部电影那么烂。希望如此。哦，对了，我只想说……我他妈早就预料到了强制喂食的情节。这破事儿存在多年了，一直这么诡异。感觉也诡异。管它呢。好吧，所以讨厌？喜欢？还是无所谓？我是不是该让它继续积灰？告诉我。爱你们所有人，非常感谢阅读！_

PEACE.

### Chapter 3 Coming In From The Cold  

_AN: Yay! New chappie! I felt a little bad after leaving this poor story to starve out for seven years, so I've decided to be not such a shitty parent and give this a bit of continuation! Hope it doesn't suck!  
作者的话：耶！新篇章！让这个可怜的故事挨饿七年之后，我感到有些内疚，所以决定不再那么糟糕地对待它，给它一些延续！希望不会太糟糕！_

At times, the halls of the vessel felt more like a confinement than anything else; she strode towards her quarters barely sparing a glance to the crew members. The only thing she'd see in their eyes would be either that faked respect filled with uncertainty, or perhaps some misguided anger would cloud through their gazes now that she had taken it upon herself to ensure their prisoner did not die of infection of starved himself to an early grave. Indeed, many of them enjoyed the new sport of watching Shinji squirm, it was probably the closest they would get to an actual victory against NERV, and so she allowed them to bask in their false sense of accomplishment.  
有时候，船舱的走廊让她感觉更像是一种禁锢而非其他；她大步走向自己的房间，几乎没有看船员们一眼。她只能从他们的眼中看到虚假的尊敬和不确定，或者在她决定确保囚犯不会因感染而死或饿死时，他们的目光中或许会闪过一些误解的愤怒。确实，许多人喜欢看真嗣挣扎的新娱乐，这可能是他们对抗 NERV 最接近胜利的时刻，因此她允许他们沉浸在虚假的成就感中。

Her hands felt dirty even while covered by the Plugsuit, the sickness had already spread out and was making her nauseated. One hand had struck him and held his mouth open while the other pushed food down into him; an unnecessary slap and an elbow to his forehead weighed down heavily in her mind for whatever stupid reason. A good shower and some time with her consoles would suffice to sharpen her mind back into the state needed for battle. Only there was no battle, not in the coming days, only the cold realization that she'd have to spend many a day with the brat in tow. _Like he's my responsibility or something, like I give a damn…_  
即便隔着强化服，她的双手仍感觉污秽不堪，那种不适感已经蔓延开来，令她作呕。一只手扇了他一巴掌并强行掰开他的嘴，另一只手则将食物硬塞进去；无论出于何种愚蠢的理由，这一记不必要的耳光和额头上的肘击都沉重地压在她的心头。好好洗个澡，再花些时间与控制台为伴，足以让她的思维重新锐利起来，以应对战斗所需的状态。只是，未来几天并没有战斗，只有冷酷的现实——她不得不带着那个小鬼度过许多日子。仿佛他是我的责任似的，好像我在乎一样……

The doors to her quarters came into view, yet before she could find some level of solace with her WonderSwan and some much required silence, an arm extended and momentarily blocked her advance. Asuka took a deep, measured breath, and allowed the full intensity of her glare to focus on the smug little smile before her.  
她房间的门映入眼帘，然而在她能找到一丝慰藉，沉浸在 WonderSwan 的世界和急需的宁静之前，一只手臂伸了出来，短暂地阻挡了她的去路。明日香深吸了一口气，缓缓地，将她那锐利的目光完全聚焦在眼前那自鸣得意的微笑上。

"Hi there, Princess." Mari said, smirk widening with that infuriating look that told Asuka the girl knew and understood things she did not. "That was really nice of you. Puppy boy was not looking so good."  
嗨，公主。" 玛丽说道，嘴角的笑意更甚，那令人恼火的神情让明日香明白，这个女孩知道并理解一些她所不了解的事情。"你真是太好了。小狗男孩看起来可不太妙。

"What the hell are you talking about?" The redhead bit back, almost baring her teeth at her copilot. She pushed the arm down, only to have it resume its position a second afterwards, still blocking her way. "What's the big idea, Four Eyes? Let me through, I want to get some rest." Hatred, annoyance and the strange heaviness in her gut boiled over her gaze, making the bespectacled female blink and realize just how _foul_ her mood was.  
"你到底在说什么鬼话？" 红发女孩反唇相讥，几乎要向她的副驾驶露出牙齿。她推开那只手臂，却见它一秒钟后又回到了原位，依旧挡住她的去路。"你这是什么意思，四眼？让我过去，我想休息一下。" 憎恨、烦躁以及内心莫名的沉重感在她眼中翻涌，让戴眼镜的女孩眨了眨眼，意识到她的情绪有多糟糕。

The brown-haired pilot moved away in flash; the button squeaked in protest as she basically punched through it to open the doors and walk inside. "You know," the other's girl's voice halted her in her steps. "Even if it was nice of you to give him that stuff, you overdid it a little bit with that slap, or that elbow." With her back turned, Asuka still felt the disapproval shine in Mari's green eyes. "You might have been a bit too harsh with that wound."  
那位棕色头发的飞行员迅速离开；她几乎是猛力按下按钮，门在抗议般的吱嘎声中打开，她随即步入其中。“你知道，”另一个女孩的声音让她停下了脚步，“即便你给他那些东西是出于好意，那一巴掌或那一肘击，你做得有点过头了。”背对着的明日香仍能感受到真希波绿色眼眸中的不满。“对那个伤口，你可能有点过于严厉了。”

"It was infected to the point of leaking pus," Asuka retaliated with a bitter undertone. The recollection of how ugly the festering wound had looked under her hold only increased the unease consuming her chest cavity with every passing second. "Got the brat to wake up, so what's the problem?"  
“那伤口已经感染到流脓了，”明日香带着苦涩的语气反驳道。回想起那溃烂的伤口在她手中丑陋的样子，不安感每分每秒都在侵蚀她的胸腔。“至少让那小子醒过来了，有什么问题吗？”

"I suppose there isn't one," Mari retorted with the carefree tone she had grown accustomed to, which meant she was accepting defeat. Good. "You didn't look too pleased to do it."  
我想是没有了，"玛丽用她已习惯的轻松语调反驳道，这意味着她接受了失败。很好。"你看起来并不乐意这么做。

"Who would be pleased to clean a child's booboo because he's too dumb to do it himself?" Her chest felt tight, the air felt scalding in her lungs; no longer did she wish to think on what she had seen in that cage, no longer did she want to remember Shinji's bloodied face and the cut on his forehead. Her hands curled into fists. "Got anything else to say, Four Eyes?"  
谁会高兴为一个孩子清理伤口，就因为他自己太笨不会做？"她的胸口感到紧绷，肺里的空气仿佛滚烫；她不再想回忆起在那笼子里看到的一切，不再想记住真嗣那血迹斑斑的脸和额头上的伤口。她的手握成了拳头。"还有什么要说的吗，四眼？

Some seconds of blessed silence passed, yet just as she was about to walk into her quarters and close herself off from the word for a few hours, Manikami's voice cut through her mind frame like a knife. "Still angry at him about _that_, huh?" she stated more than asked. "Maybe you should tell him, I don't know. Might help. Are you going to hurt him _more_, now that you're being dropped off?"  
几秒钟的宁静时光悄然流逝，正当她准备步入自己的房间，将自己与世界隔绝几个小时时，Manikami 的声音如利刃般刺穿了她的思绪。“还在为那件事生他的气，是吧？”她与其说是询问，不如说是陈述。“也许你应该告诉他，我不知道。可能会有些帮助。既然你现在要被送走了，你会不会伤害他更多？”

A single blood-shot, hate filled cerulean iris whipped in Mari's direction; Asuka's eye narrowed. "Go to hell."  
一只充血的、充满恨意的蔚蓝眼眸猛地转向 Mari 的方向；Asuka 的眼睛眯了起来。“下地狱去吧。”

The door hissed closed. 门嘶的一声关上了。

Quick and expert hands decompressed and peeled off the Plugsuit in a hurry. She paid no mind to the eyepatch whatsoever, simply climbed into the shower, and allowed the cold water to wash off the nonexistent grime from her frame. She scraped at the skin of her palms and knuckles to dispel the sensation of blood in between her fingertips, of the sensation of the boy's pulse under her hold. After a thorough rinsing of her hair, Asuka picked the used-up, stained and foul smelling suit, throwing it in the waste basket. _I don't intend to wear that one ever again, they can have it burned for all I care,_ she thought while changing into some more comfortable clothes, enraged, and collapsed on her cot with a grunt.  
灵巧熟练的手迅速解压并剥下 Plug Suit，她对眼罩毫不在意，径直步入淋浴间，任由冷水冲刷身上并不存在的污垢。她用力刮擦掌心和指节的皮肤，试图驱散指间那股若有似无的血腥感，以及握住少年脉搏时的触感。彻底冲洗完头发后，明日香捡起那件已用过、沾染污渍且散发恶臭的紧身衣，将其扔进垃圾桶。她心想，再也不想穿那件了，随他们怎么处理，哪怕烧掉也无所谓，一边换上更舒适的衣物，怒气未消地哼了一声，倒在床上。

Not a full minute passed and she was already pressing the buttons of her console and going through the motions of winning a game she had played thousands of times. The sounds the tiny device produced began to ease her mind after the third consecutive win; the hollowness in her chest faded whilst her tired eye focused only on the display before her. This was a particular favorite; just her in a ship against a coming maelstrom of enemies attacking all at once, with no back-up or a chance to retreat. The only way to win was to destroy the enemy completely. Her eye narrowed, they were coming faster than she recalled them doing in that particular level, the ships were bigger and more difficult to destroy. Her eyelid itched.  
不到一分钟，她便开始按动控制台上的按钮，熟练地玩起那款已玩过数千次的电子游戏，仿佛胜利在握。连续三次获胜后，这个小设备发出的声音逐渐平复了她的心绪；胸中的空虚感消退，疲惫的双眼只专注于眼前的屏幕。这是她特别钟爱的一款游戏：她独自驾驶飞船，迎战一波接一波蜂拥而至的敌军，没有援军，也无路可退。唯一的取胜之道便是彻底歼灭敌人。她眯起眼睛，敌军来袭的速度比记忆中这一关卡的还要快，飞船也更大，更难以摧毁。眼皮开始发痒。

The buttons were pushed more violently than before, yet however much she tried the speed of her ship would not suffice. Her attacks were insufficient, the enemy was beginning to swarm her, how come? This was a strategy that had worked marvelously before, why was she so slow? Anger was almost permanent in her being, helping her negate and stifle any and all other emotions that ever threatened to surface. She was angry then, very much so, so why the hell was she losing? _Maybe I'm just tired,_ pondered the Second Child, and scratched away at her eye. Just before the redhead could focus her attention back on the game and destroy the bothersome legion coming her way, the black hat resting by her thigh came to view.  
按钮被按得比以往更猛烈，然而无论她如何努力，飞船的速度仍不够快。她的攻击力不足，敌人开始蜂拥而至，怎么会这样？这策略之前明明效果奇佳，为何现在如此迟缓？愤怒几乎成了她的常态，助她排斥并压抑一切试图浮现的情感。此刻她怒火中烧，极其强烈，那为何还在节节败退？或许我只是累了，二号孩子思忖着，挠了挠眼睛。就在红发女孩准备重新集中注意力于游戏，消灭迎面而来的烦人军团前，她大腿旁的黑帽映入眼帘。

The damn thing, while being comfortable enough to wear, was a tad too large and baggy for her taste. It did wonders against the cold, nonetheless. Her gaze softened without Asuka ever realizing it when the small blue roundel came into view. Not missing a single beat, the pilot's hands moved automatically without her even bothering to view the screen. If she tried hard enough, the sound of the Entry Plug collapsing around her as Unit 01 bit into it could drown out any and all other sounds in her vicinity. The memory was branded into her brain just as the sickness that made her inhuman was permanently scorched into her other eye. And yet, there she sat, gazing at the tiny blue, white and red roundel and recalling a Bento Box from forever ago.  
那件该死的东西，虽说穿着还算舒适，但对她而言略显过大且宽松。尽管如此，它抵御寒冷的效果却出奇地好。当那枚小小的蓝色圆徽映入眼帘时，她的目光不由自主地柔和下来，而明日香自己却未曾察觉。飞行员的手指不假思索地自动操作，她甚至懒得去看屏幕一眼。若她努力尝试，初号机咬合插入栓时那环绕四周的声响，足以淹没她周围的一切杂音。这段记忆如同烙印般深深刻在她的脑海中，正如那令她非人化的病症永远烙印在她的另一只眼眸里。然而，她依旧坐在那里，凝视着那枚蓝白红相间的小小圆徽，回想起久远之前的便当盒。

The anger subsided once more, to her dismay, and the hollowness crawled its way back to her awareness. _He left, fought against me, knocked me down, and hit me. And he… the little brat, chose to do nothing…_ _**nothing**__, that time. And now he asked me to kill him. Little shit. I should've…_ The elbow to his forehead could have been potentially dangerous, even fatal, considering how little control of her own strength she'd had in that particular moment. It had gotten a bit too close to his temple, a few inches more to the left and the brat would have been knocked out cold. The second slap had felt a tad unnecessary. She had gripped the wound and squeezed with no other wish than to make Shinji feel pain. Punched him in the gut, almost choked him with food.  
怒火再次消退，令她沮丧，空虚感悄然回归她的意识。他离开了，与我对抗，将我击倒，殴打我。而他……那个小混蛋，选择什么都不做……那次什么都没做。现在他却让我杀了他。小混蛋。我本该……那一肘击向他的额头可能相当危险，甚至致命，考虑到那一刻她对自己力量的控制是多么微弱。那一击离他的太阳穴太近了，再偏左几英寸，那小子就会昏迷不醒。第二记耳光显得有些多余。她紧抓伤口，用力挤压，只愿让真嗣感受到痛苦。她击打他的腹部，几乎用食物噎住他。

The WonderSwan beeped loudly. WIN! GO TO NEXT LEVEL Y/N  
神奇天鹅游戏机发出响亮的哔哔声。胜利！进入下一关？是/否

_Yeah, great win._ She sighed and continued to destroy enemy ships, this time having little to no trouble obliterating them in a clean, orderly fashion. _Flawless victory. Now I don't even have an EVA to pilot, gotta wait for a stupid month or more. And how very nice of Misato to simply say 'let's dump the brat in the village and see if he dies of exposure there instead of in my ship.' How very thoughtful, such an incredibly solid plan._  
是啊，大获全胜。她叹了口气，继续摧毁敌舰，这次几乎毫不费力地以干净利落的方式将它们彻底消灭。完美胜利。现在我连个 EVA 都没得驾驶，还得等上愚蠢的一个月甚至更久。还有 Misato 真是太好了，居然说‘把那小子丢到村子里，看他会不会在那儿冻死，而不是在我的船上。’多么周到啊，真是个无比扎实的计划。

Nobody expected anyone but Shinji to take care of Shinji. There were limited resources, every person in the village fulfilled a role, nobody had time to spare on the idiot who had almost completely destroyed the world twice. In the state he was currently in, the possibility of him wandering off, getting lost and simply starving out in the outskirts of the fields felt quite real. Not that she cared, not in the slightest. Her interest with him being alive was simply a responsibility to make him pay for his wrongdoings, a desire to show him, to his face, what damage he had perpetrated. Perhaps, the little bastard would wake up then and make a proper choice for once in his miserable life.  
除了真嗣，没人指望有人会照顾真嗣。资源有限，村里的每个人都扮演着角色，没人有时间去照顾那个几乎两次彻底毁灭世界的傻瓜。以他目前的状态，他走失、迷路，然后在田野边缘饿死的概率相当真实。不过她并不在乎，一点儿也不。她对他活着的兴趣仅仅是一种责任，让他为自己的错误付出代价，渴望当面告诉他，他造成了多大的破坏。也许，那个小混蛋到时候会醒悟过来，在他悲惨的人生中做出一次正确的选择。

She crushed the following level, and the next, _and_ the final one with minimal difficulty, switched the game in a fluid motion and went about collecting treasures and killing foes. The dead look in Shinji's eyes told her he had already _seen_ the result of said wrongdoings, and as someone who had been manipulated and used as a weapon her entire life, there was a sickening sense of understanding there, when she allowed herself to think on the boy's actions. _Make him desperate, make him break, point him in a direction where salvation is possible, at least make him think salvation is in the direction you're pointing at._ After a few minutes the console beeped and she went to the next level, massacring foes in a quick, mechanized fashion. _Tell him do this, do that, and everything goes away. And you do it nicely, something the stupid brat doesn't even know. Who am I kidding? What reason did_ _**anybody**_ _in this ship give the idiot to stay here?_  
她轻松碾压了下一关，再下一关，直至最后一关，动作流畅地切换游戏，开始收集宝藏并消灭敌人。真嗣眼中那死寂的神情告诉她，他已经预见了这些错误行为的后果。作为一个一生都被操纵和当作武器的人，当她让自己思考这男孩的行为时，她感到了一种令人作呕的理解。让他绝望，让他崩溃，指引他到一个可能获得救赎的方向，至少让他以为救赎就在你指向的方向。几分钟后，控制台发出哔声，她进入下一关，以快速机械的方式屠杀敌人。告诉他这样做，那样做，一切都会消失。而你做得很好，那个愚蠢的小子甚至不知道。我这是在自欺欺人吗？这艘船上的任何人有什么理由让这个傻瓜留在这里？

Her eye drifted back to the hat. The emptiness returned with a drowning vengeance and made breathing difficult. Was this how guilt felt? And why on Earth would she feel guilty of anything in the first place?  
她的目光再次飘向那顶帽子。空虚感如溺水般猛烈袭来，令她呼吸困难。这就是内疚的感觉吗？而她究竟为什么会首先感到内疚呢？

After crushing another level she turned off the console and threw it near the hat and jacket resting by her feet. Shinji had a fever, a festering wound devouring the flesh around his forearm, a wound that should not exist at all. True, his inaction had hurt her in ways that could not yet be described or voiced out, but hurting him back produced nothing more than the dreadful disgust and an unbearable weight in her chest. The expected bliss or feeling of retaliation never manifested, like her expectations with life in general, they went about unfulfilled. Just when she thought she had grasped at something, just when it felt as though she would be vindicated, everything turned into blood, dust and ashes.  
又打通了一关后，她关掉游戏机，随手扔到脚边闲置的帽子和夹克旁。真嗣发烧了，他前臂上溃烂的伤口正吞噬着周围的血肉，那伤口本不该存在。诚然，他的不作为以尚无法言说或描述的方式伤害了她，但反过来伤害他只带来了令人作呕的厌恶感和胸中难以承受的重负。预期的快感或复仇感从未显现，就像她对生活的一般期望一样，总是落空。就在她以为自己抓住了什么，就在她感觉自己即将得到平反时，一切却化为了血、尘和灰烬。

What was it to her if Shinji lived or died, anyway? Why did it hurt to think about him… not existing?  
真嗣的生死对她来说究竟算什么呢？为什么一想到他不存在，心就会痛？

Her thoughts drifted to simpler times, to a visit an the aquarium and a Bento Box, and soon enough, Asuka fell asleep. It lasted it's typical hour or two.  
她的思绪飘向了更简单的时光，回忆起参观水族馆和享用便当盒的情景，不久，明日香便沉沉睡去。这一觉持续了她惯常的一两个小时。

---

The burning in his forehead was the first sensation that welcomed the Third Child back into awareness. His body felt drained and heavy, the stinging of his arm which had been blessedly muffled for days on end burned next. With a groan, he realized at some point in the night the half-healed scab close to his temple had opened, and stuck to the material of the stiff pillow he had been given. He hissed when the fabric was ripped away and a tiny new trail of blood began to descend down his face.  
额头上的灼热感是唤醒第三适格者的第一感觉。他的身体感到疲惫而沉重，手臂上那已经持续数日被压抑的刺痛感紧随其后。他呻吟着意识到，在夜里的某个时刻，靠近太阳穴的半愈合伤口裂开了，粘在了他得到的硬枕头上。当布料被撕开时，他倒吸了一口凉气，一条细小的新血迹开始顺着他的脸颊流下。

Shinji's eyes caught a glimpse of the white gauze covering the better part of his forearm while his right palm moved to stop the slight bleeding. The small cut was throbbing with pain, and the tissue around it was slightly swollen from the way he had slammed his skull against the steel floor. Surprisingly enough, the nausea which had so permanently accompanied him ever since Kaworu's death was not completely overbearing.  
真嗣的目光瞥见了覆盖大半前臂的白色纱布，他的右手掌移动以止住轻微的出血。那小伤口隐隐作痛，周围组织因他猛撞钢制地板而略显肿胀。令人意外的是，自卡罗尔死后一直如影随形的恶心感并未完全压倒他。

_Still alive..._ he thought lazily; a headache was blossoming both in the back of his skull and around the small cut, the wound on his forearm stung when he moved his hand and itched if he stayed still. His skin felt cold and clammy and he shivered lightly, even in the controlled environment. Before he could lay back down on the mattress and take the buds away from his ears, the familiar noise of the first meal of the day being delivered directed his attention to the gate.  
他还活着……他懒洋洋地想着；头痛在后脑勺和小伤口周围蔓延开来，前臂的伤口在他移动手时刺痛，静止时则发痒。他的皮肤感觉冰冷而黏腻，即便在恒温环境中也轻微颤抖。在他能躺回床垫并摘下耳机之前，熟悉的送餐声将他的注意力引向了门口。

"_You will eat."_ Asuka growled in his memory, and Shinji felt himself frown at the plate. _So I'm supposed to stay alive just so I can suffer and grovel until you're satisfied, right?_ With weakened, trembling legs and constant shakes of his body as it fought off the infection, he retrieved the tray, collapsed on the steel chair and pushed the tasteless pastes into his mouth. The nausea returned, but he continued to eat, only taking small breaks to drink water. It had surely been a figment of his imagination, a slip of his damaged consciousness. He had not slept for days, after all; whatever he had heard had been obviously produced by exhaustion.  
“你得吃。”明日香在他记忆中咆哮，真嗣对着盘子皱起了眉头。所以我得活着，就为了受苦和卑躬屈膝，直到你满意为止，对吧？双腿无力颤抖，身体不断颤动以抵抗感染，他取过托盘，瘫坐在钢椅上，将无味的糊状物塞进嘴里。恶心感再次袭来，但他继续进食，只是偶尔停下来喝水。这无疑是他想象中的幻觉，是受损意识的一次滑脱。毕竟，他已经好几天没睡了；无论他听到了什么，显然都是疲惫所致。

_Her voice… changed._ He pushed the clear-colored bar into his mouth and forced his jaw to chew on it, recalling the ghastly sensation of the redhead's palm pushing food down his throat. _I thought I heard something… something different. Like her voice was… shaking. Pff, yeah right._ The last of the bland bars disappeared; the empty tray stared at him from across his lap and the feeling of a rock sitting inside his guts kept the massive nausea at bay for the time of being. He confirmed the red dot on the camera was still active, sighed, and placed the tray on the floor.  
她的声音……变了。他将那块透明色的能量棒塞进嘴里，强迫自己咀嚼，回想起红发女子手掌将食物推入喉咙的可怕感觉。我以为我听到了什么……有些不同。像是她的声音在……颤抖。噗，没错。最后一块乏味的能量棒消失了；空荡荡的托盘从他腿上瞪视着他，腹中如坠石块的感觉暂时压制住了那股强烈的恶心。他确认摄像头上的红点仍在闪烁，叹了口气，将托盘放在了地板上。

_Soap. Shower. A place where… the sky is blue._ His mind was hazy. Thinking on anything was difficult and trying to digest reality, especially his current situation and the events which had led him to it, was physically painful to him, yet the comfortable escape of shock and disconnection had been robbed from him altogether. Once again, his cobalt eyes drifted to the bandages around his arm; a mixture of warmth and bitter spite mingled in his being as the vague memories of Asuka cleaning and dressing the infected cut came back in droplets. The pain had escalated, slowly at first and then became so acute that it had roused him from whatever state he had been in, and still as he stared at the bar of soap and toothpaste it was difficult to force himself into moving.  
肥皂。淋浴。一个地方……天空湛蓝。他的思绪朦胧不清。思考任何事情都变得困难，试图理解现实，尤其是他目前的处境和导致这一切的事件，对他来说是一种身体上的痛苦，然而震惊和断联带来的舒适逃避已完全被剥夺。他的钴蓝色眼睛再次飘向手臂上的绷带；模糊的记忆中，明日香清理并包扎感染伤口的情景如细流般回现，他的内心交织着温暖与苦涩的怨恨。疼痛逐渐加剧，起初缓慢，随后变得如此剧烈，以至于将他从任何状态中唤醒，即便如此，当他盯着那块肥皂和牙膏时，强迫自己行动依然困难重重。

When had the thought of showering become such a difficult and exhausting task?  
何时开始，洗澡这个念头变得如此艰难而耗神？

The state of his gown was deplorable. He noticed how the stains of blood, snot, saliva and vomit now decorated the plain cloth and exuded a foul smell. Had he been so far gone that even such a stench had arisen not a single response in him? He scrunched up his nose in distaste, took the bar of soap in hand and sprung into the shower without a second thought, ignoring the constant tremors of his body or the fact that he had not yet seen a towel in the room. The water was cold, stank of chlorine and felt chilling to his sweated skin. He shivered under the stream, teeth chattering, and forced his left arm up to keep the bandages from getting wet as his right hand cleansed away at the grime of the past days.  
他的长袍状况堪忧。他注意到，血迹、鼻涕、唾液和呕吐物如今点缀着这朴素的布料，散发出难闻的气味。难道他已经堕落到连这样的恶臭都无法引起一丝反应了吗？他厌恶地皱起鼻子，拿起肥皂，毫不犹豫地跳进淋浴间，无视身体的持续颤抖或房间里尚未见到毛巾的事实。水冰冷，散发着氯气的臭味，让他汗湿的皮肤感到刺骨的寒意。他在水流下颤抖，牙齿打战，强撑着左臂不让绷带沾湿，同时右手清洗着过去几日的污垢。

Once his body had been properly scrubbed, Shinji made certain to thoroughly wash the cut on his forehead to the best of his abilities; the welt on his forehead was about the only place in his body where the cold water was not causing endless shakes. Despite the chilling temperature of the water he still felt half-awake, not truly there, somehow disentangled from the world and his own body. The vague sensations of pain and discomfort, hunger, thirst and the strange shakes were more acute, almost rooting him to the little cage and the cold steel floor under his naked feet.  
身体彻底搓洗干净后，真嗣尽力仔细清洗额头上的伤口，这是他全身唯一一处冷水未引起无尽颤抖的地方。尽管水温冰冷，他仍感到半梦半醒，仿佛与世隔绝，与自身躯体脱节。模糊的痛感、不适、饥饿、口渴以及那奇异的颤抖愈发强烈，几乎将他牢牢钉在狭小的笼中，以及脚下冰冷的钢铁地板上。

Something beeped on his left and suddenly a towel and a proper change of clothes composed of undergarments, a pair of black trousers, shoes and a white shirt were presented to him. For a while he stood there, water dripping off his body as tremors ran all through his body; only when the bandage began to moisten did he remember he was supposed to dry himself off and dress. At every passing second the discomfort became more acute, he realized there was an ache that went all the way into his bones, a feeling of constant heat clashing with the cold his skin registered with every passing second. His forehead throbbed with pain, his arm burned and itched and drove needles of pain up and down his forearm; he was especially careful to not move or interfere with the bandages to the best of his capabilities and once he was dressed, sat back down on the cot and stared at the floor, lost in thought.  
他左侧传来一声哔响，突然间，一条毛巾和一套得体的换洗衣物——包括内衣、一条黑色长裤、鞋子和一件白衬衫——呈现在他面前。他站在那里，水珠从身上滴落，全身颤抖不已；直到绷带开始湿润，他才想起自己应该擦干身体并穿上衣服。每一秒过去，不适感都愈发强烈，他意识到有一种疼痛深入骨髓，一种持续的热感与皮肤每秒感受到的寒冷交织在一起。他的额头阵阵作痛，手臂又烧又痒，针扎般的痛感在手臂上下游走；他特别小心，尽量不移动或触碰绷带，穿好衣服后，他重新坐回床边，凝视着地板，陷入沉思。

_I think I might be sick,_ the realization came minutes after he sat down; the room's temperature made him shiver despite him being fully clothed and dry. There was no blanket or cover on the cot, nothing to help him ease the chill, so Shinji brought his legs close to his chest and curled into himself. After a few minutes of hugging his legs, the boy was able to bring the constant shaking to some semblance of control and reached over to the SDAT. Track 27 began to play, its soothing melody drowning out the sound of Kaworu's body exploding, or the horrible sound of Asuka's Entry Plug being crushed under his teeth. Entire cities destroyed, a massive desert stained crimson due to his stupid desire to, for once, just once, save one person.  
我觉得自己可能要病倒了，这个念头在他坐下几分钟后袭来；房间的温度让他即便全身衣物干燥也止不住颤抖。小床上没有毯子或遮盖物，没有任何东西能帮他驱散寒意，于是真嗣将双腿紧贴胸前，蜷缩成一团。抱住双腿几分钟后，男孩终于让持续的颤抖有所缓解，他伸手去拿 SDAT。第 27 轨开始播放，那抚慰人心的旋律淹没了渚薰身体爆炸的声音，或是明日香插入栓在他齿间被碾碎的可怕声响。整座城市被摧毁，广袤的沙漠因他那愚蠢的愿望——只为这一次，仅仅一次——拯救一个人而染成血红。

"…_But my head made headstrong… by the head of the Almighty. We forward in this generation… triumphantly… Won't you help to sing? These songs of freedom… 'cause all I ever had… Redemption Songs… Redemption songs…"_  
“…但我的意志被至高者所坚定…我们在这世代中…凯旋前行…你难道不愿同唱？这些自由之歌…因为所有我曾拥有…救赎之歌…救赎之歌…”

His eyes wandered over to where the dictionary sat. Asuka had… brought him that dictionary; the Second Child, the person who by all means had every right to hate him and every little thing about him had not only bothered to bring that dictionary to him. The batteries in his SDAT, the toothpaste and toothbrush, the soap, the bandages around his forearm, they were all… precious, in some strange way.  
他的目光游移到字典所在之处。明日香……给他带来了那本字典；那个二号机驾驶员，按理说完全有理由憎恨他以及他的一切，却不仅费心将字典送到他手中。他 SDAT 里的电池，牙膏和牙刷，肥皂，前臂上的绷带，这些……在某种奇异的方式下，都显得无比珍贵。

Ignoring the pain that flared all over his forearm, Shinji picked up the heavy book and began to look for the marked pages; a strangled chuckle made its way out of his throat when he first noticed the bright red bookmarks decorating the R section of the book. A bright marker had been indiscriminately used around the word he was looking for, with bold letters drawn in plain Kanji which said 'here, you idiot. That's the word.' Despite feeling detached, cold and miserable, Shinji's gaze fondly went over the words Asuka had written many times; his thumb caressed the imprint her pen had left on the paper. Asuka's actions confused him; she seemed happy enough to despise and hurt him. Why had she bothered to make him eat, then? Why has she bothered to rinse out the infection in the cut around his wrist?  
无视前臂四处燃起的疼痛，真嗣拾起那本沉重的书，开始寻找标记的页码；当他注意到书中 R 部分点缀的鲜红书签时，喉咙里不禁发出一声窒息般的轻笑。一个醒目的记号笔在他寻找的词汇周围随意涂抹，用清晰的汉字写着“这里，笨蛋。就是这个字。”尽管感到疏离、冰冷且痛苦，真嗣的目光仍温柔地掠过明日香多次书写的字迹；他的拇指轻抚着她笔尖在纸上留下的痕迹。明日香的行为让他困惑；她似乎乐于蔑视并伤害他。那她为何还要费心让他进食呢？又为何要费心清洗他手腕伤口周围的感染？

He read through the definition four times before the words began to settle in his brain.  
他反复读了四遍定义，词语才开始在他的脑海中沉淀下来。

'_Redemption: re·demp·tion; 1. The action of saving or being saved from sin, error, or evil. 2. The action of regaining or gaining possession of something in exchange for payment, or clearing a debt. 3: The act of making something better or more acceptable. Legal definition: the act, process, or fact of redeeming.'_  
'救赎：救·赎；1. 拯救或被拯救脱离罪恶、错误或邪恶的行为。2. 通过支付交换物或清偿债务来重新获得或获取某物的行为。3：使某事物变得更好或更可接受的行为。法律定义：赎回的行为、过程或事实。'

The third definition bounced through his head again and again, overshadowing the memory of his stupidity at picking up the spears, fighting Asuka and almost ending the world. The act of… making something better, or more acceptable. How was he to ever make the Second's Child's rightful wrath better? How was he to ever make existing in the desolated wasteland that was the world any more acceptable? What power did he possess to revert such ominous, absolute damage? Oblivion and nothingness felt so much more achievable than the ridiculous hope of mending his mistakes… there was no point in dreaming of impossible things, anymore. Not after Kaworu, not after his foolishness had cost the world so much, yet again.  
第三个定义在他脑海中反复回荡，掩盖了他愚蠢地拾起长矛、与明日香战斗并几乎毁灭世界的记忆。这个行为……是为了让事物变得更好，或更可接受。他该如何平息第二适格者正当的愤怒？他该如何让存在于这片荒芜废土般的世界变得更可接受？他有何力量能逆转如此不祥、绝对的破坏？比起荒谬地希望弥补错误，遗忘和虚无显得更加可行……再梦想不可能的事情已经没有意义了。在经历了渚薰之后，在他又一次因愚蠢让世界付出如此代价之后。

"_Your punishment must be more severe."_  
你的惩罚必须更加严厉。

_Yeah, I suppose so,_ he pondered, playing with the small music player as he rewound track 27 over and over again. Without Unit 01 he was no threat, and neither was he any good. What could he possibly offer to the world if it was not his ability to destroy it? _Maybe after my father gets his wish, and everything is gone, then maybe I can… what? Rest? Would I?_ That eye-patch, it was evidently his doing or, better said, his absolute lack of any action whatsoever which had caused it. Living the rest of his days with that added weight to his shoulders felt unnaturally taxing; never mind that he had almost destroyed everything and everyone twice, he had condemned Asuka to a life filled with… what?  
是啊，我想也是，他沉思着，摆弄着那台小型音乐播放器，一遍遍倒回第 27 轨。没有初号机，他构不成威胁，同样也毫无用处。若非毁灭世界的能力，他还能为这个世界贡献什么呢？或许等父亲如愿以偿，一切化为乌有后，我或许能……做什么？休息吗？我会吗？那只眼罩，显然是他所为，或者更确切地说，是他完全不作为的结果。余生肩负这份额外重担，感觉异常沉重；更别提他几乎两次毁灭一切与所有人，还让明日香陷入了……怎样的生活？

He chuckled and shook his head in derision. There was nothing he knew of her life, not a thing, not after so many years which had felt like nothing short of a flash to him. One moment he was pulling Rei out of that Angel, the next… he was sitting on that cold chair with lights pressing into his retinas and burning through his eyelids. There were so many questions he wanted to ask and felt impossibly unable to formulate, so much to atone for, so much he desperately wanted to know, so much he wanted to erase.  
他轻声笑了出来，摇头表示嘲讽。他对她的生活一无所知，一丁点儿都没有，尤其是在这些年对他而言仿佛转瞬即逝之后。前一刻他还在从那使徒体内救出丽，下一刻……他已坐在那冰冷的椅子上，灯光直射入他的视网膜，穿透眼睑灼烧着。他有太多问题想问，却感到难以言表，有太多需要弥补，有太多他迫切想了解，也有太多他想抹去。

Shinji sighed, picked up the glass of water next to his bed and emptied it. The red dot never stopped blinking, not for a second, neither did the chill which dug all the way onto his being. With no true idea of how much of the unease of his body was due to disease and how much could be attributed to fatigue, the boy pressed his back against the metal wall. Was it also his fault that Asuka did not seem to age as years went by? _Probably,_ he thought, and hugged his legs tighter. _The curse of EVA… the curse of Shinji, you mean._ The blood of Unit 03 felt hot against his palms, he felt the Entry Plug give away and be crushed under his jaw. Rei had been there, in his arms. How come she was gone, now?  
真嗣叹了口气，拿起床边的水杯一饮而尽。那红色的光点从未停止闪烁，一刻也不曾停歇，那份深入骨髓的寒意亦是如此。他无法确切分辨身体的不适有多少是疾病所致，又有多少是疲劳所致，少年只好将背部紧贴在金属墙壁上。难道这也是他的错，让明日香似乎随着岁月的流逝而未曾老去？或许吧，他想，更紧地抱住了自己的双腿。EVA 的诅咒……或者说，是真嗣的诅咒。三号机血液的余温还残留在他的掌心，他感觉到插入栓在他颚下崩裂、粉碎。丽曾在他怀中，为何如今却已消失无踪？

The wound around his wrist flared.  
手腕上的伤口突然灼痛起来。

"_You can call me Asuka, and I'll call you Baka-Shinji."_  
你可以叫我明日香，我就叫你笨蛋真嗣。

"_Do something already, Baka-Shinji!"_  
快点行动啊，笨蛋真嗣！

The first memory came back easily enough; if he closed his eyes and tired hard enough Misato's apartment and the slight warmth of Asuka's body next to his was so easy to remember. The second one, however, he had no clue of where and how he had heard those words, or why they forced a sudden fire to arise in his chest whenever they manifested. A sense of urgency, the sensation of wrath boiling out of his chest, the need to act, to do something for once and then… nothingness, silence and uncertainty.  
第一个记忆很容易就回来了；只要他闭上眼睛，努力回想，就能轻易记起美里小姐的公寓和明日香身体传来的微弱温暖。然而，第二个记忆，他完全不知道是在哪里、如何听到那些话的，也不知道为什么每当这些话浮现时，他的胸中就会突然燃起一股怒火。一种紧迫感，胸中沸腾的愤怒，那种需要行动、做点什么的冲动，然后……虚无，寂静和不确定。

_A place where the sky is blue,_ pondered the Third Child as his features descended into a light frown. _I suppose that became a novelty as well, after my… after I almost ended the world._ Being caught inside his mind, with the world as little else than background noise was vastly preferable to the array of unwanted emotions and overall physical ailment both his body and mind seemed overeager to provide. A place where the sky was blue... a _world_ where the sky was blue. _I wonder if that would be enough… to earn my permission._  
第三子沉思着，眉头轻蹙。我想，那片蓝天也成了一种新奇，在我……在我差点终结世界之后。被困在自己的思绪中，世界不过是背景噪音，远比那些不请自来的情感和身心过度的痛苦要好得多。一片蓝天……一个蓝天下的世界。我不知那是否足够……来赢得我的许可。

Reality shifted in and out of focus; every now and then he felt the cot disappear and the backrest of the Entry Plug press against him. A shower of crimson, the realization that he had so majorly messed things up that it had taken all of WUNDER's efforts to halt the next Apocalypse; it became almost impossible to escape. Why had Asuka robbed him of the last possible solace available, why had she taken him away from that frozen state of non-feeling?  
现实时隐时现；他时而感觉床消失了，驾驶舱的靠背压向他。一片猩红，意识到自己搞砸了大事，以至于 WUNDER 全体努力才阻止了下一场末日；几乎无法逃脱。为什么明日香夺走了他最后的慰藉，为什么她将他从那种冻结的无感状态中带走？

_My punishment must be… more severe,_ recalled the Third Child. His fingers pressed rewind, stop, then play automatically. The fever receded to a degree; the sting of his arm dulled to a certain extent. With no clue whatsoever of how much time had passed or how long he was to wait until the next meal, Shinji noticed there were other words marked up in the dictionary aside from the two that composed the song he had been listening to on a loop for the past few days. He decided to go over each and every word she had marked.  
第三子的回忆中，他的惩罚必定是……更加严厉的。他的手指不由自主地按下了倒带、停止，然后是播放。热度有所减退；手臂的刺痛感也减弱了几分。对于已经过去多久或是还要等多久才能吃下一餐，真嗣毫无头绪。他注意到字典里除了那首他这几天反复听的歌的两个词之外，还有其他被标记的词。他决定逐一查看她标记的每一个词。

'Anger. Choice. Doubt. Fear. Inaction. Maim. Mature. Negligence. Painful. Redemption. Retribution. Resentment. Sol-'  
'愤怒。选择。怀疑。恐惧。不作为。致残。成熟。疏忽。痛苦。救赎。报复。怨恨。孤独-'

He turned away his eyes and pretended the word was not glaring at him, marked in bright yellow. He read through the next words 'Song. Torment. Waste. Wither,' and felt his heart sink with every definition read. It felt as though she was giving him a message, and not at all a hopeful nor a comforting one; whatever had had once been there was evidently gone and forgotten, it had withered away with time and finished rotting with his latest acts of stupidity. The one word he had first tried to avoid came alive in his brain, refusing to be ignored. Shinji sighed as his fingers traced through the pages; the letters felt like knives, they clung into his very soul and threatened to reduce him to a sniveling mess all over again.  
他移开视线，假装那个用鲜黄色标记的词并未刺眼地盯着他。他读着接下来的词：“歌。折磨。浪费。枯萎。”每读一个定义，他的心就沉一分。仿佛她在向他传递信息，绝非充满希望或安慰；曾经存在的一切显然已消失无踪，随着时间的流逝而枯萎，因他最近的愚蠢行为而腐烂殆尽。他最初试图回避的那个词在他脑海中活了起来，不容忽视。真嗣叹了口气，手指在书页间划过；那些字母如同刀刃，深深刺入他的灵魂，威胁着要将他再次变成一个哭泣的可怜虫。

"Solitude," he muttered to the empty cell. At last something he could understand and relate to even in the slightest of ways. Such a shame… he was fourteen years too late. If his punishment was to live on, it certainly felt agonizing. Shinji clutched the book closer to himself and remembered he was also to brush his teeth and eat whenever food was presented. The heavy, worn out surface and damaged pages kept the memory of Kaworu at bay for the time of being.  
“孤独。”他对着空荡荡的牢房喃喃自语。终于有一样他能理解并稍稍产生共鸣的东西了。可惜……他晚了十四年。如果他的惩罚是要继续活下去，那感觉确实痛苦。真嗣将书紧紧抱在怀里，想起自己还得按时刷牙，并在食物送来时进食。那本沉重、破旧且页面残缺的书暂时让他忘却了卡尔的记忆。

Batteries for his SDAT, a dictionary, toothpaste and a toothbrush, soap; Asuka had even bothered to clean up the infection clinging to his arm. For the first time in his life, he was holding… gifts… given to him without reason or justification. All of the sudden, Shinji felt irrationally attached to them, vowing to himself to keep them close no matter what.  
他的 SDAT 电池、一本词典、牙膏和牙刷、肥皂；明日香甚至费心清理了他手臂上顽固的感染。他生平第一次，手中握着……无缘无故赠予他的……礼物。突然间，真嗣感到一种无理的依恋，暗自发誓无论发生什么都要将它们珍藏。

---

"I don't have time to think about nonsense like this," Misato stated without turning. "You have your orders. If he at any point behaves suspiciously, immobilize him. If he tries to get back in the WUNDER, taze him. What about any of this is unclear to you, Major?"  
“我没时间考虑这种无聊的事，”美里头也不回地说道，“你有你的命令。如果他任何时候行为可疑，就制服他。如果他试图回到 WUNDER 上，就电击他。这些有什么不清楚的，少校？”

Her crossed arms tightened, glare turning deadly on the purple head in front of her. "The prisoner's as harmful as a squirrel at this point. He's nursing a considerable fever and went about four days without eating," she allowed the small silence to stretch inside the woman's small office/quarters. So much bitterness, so much hatred; the aura in the room was more stifling than the one in her own bedroom, the permanent discomfort and stress Misato exuded was impossible to miss or escape from. "And now you want me to electrocute him."  
她交叉的双臂收紧，目光如刀般刺向面前那颗紫色脑袋。“此刻的囚犯就像一只无害的松鼠。他正发着高烧，已经四天没吃东西了，”她让这短暂的沉默在女人的小办公室兼住所内蔓延。如此多的苦涩，如此多的仇恨；房间里的氛围比她自己的卧室还要压抑，Misato 所散发的持久不适与压力难以忽视或逃避。“而现在，你却要我电击他。”

"Should the mission in Paris succeed, it will take no less than a month to have both Units armed and ready for combat," she watched the older woman produce a bottle of whatever cheap alcohol the villagers managed to ferment off their rice harvest, take a hefty drink as she went over the digitalized maps in front of her. "Who knows what can happen. Keep an eye on him, or don't. In the end it doesn't really matter. Should he become a problem let me know, and I'll end it." She produced the DSS trigger from her jacket to emphasize her point. Asuka felt sick to her stomach and felt the ring around her own neck burn. "Have I made myself clear, Pilot?"  
“如果巴黎的任务成功，至少需要一个月的时间来武装并准备好两台机体投入战斗，”她看着年长的女人从村民们用稻米酿制的廉价酒精中拿出一瓶，大口喝下，同时审视着面前的数字化地图。“谁知道会发生什么。盯着他，或者不盯。最终这并不真正重要。如果他成为麻烦，告诉我，我会解决。”她从夹克中取出 DSS 触发器以强调自己的观点。Asuka 感到胃里一阵恶心，感觉自己脖子上的项圈灼热难耐。“我说明白了吗，驾驶员？”

"Crystal," she growled back and turned away, heading for the door. At times like he current one she wondered where exactly the jolly drunk she had first gotten to interact with in the early days of the War had gone to. The eye-patch reminder her that right after her initial defeat and subsequent infection by the Ninth Angel, the world had stopped making sense. "Whatever you say. See you in a month, I suppose. Try not to die."  
“克丽斯蒂娜，”她低吼一声，转身向门口走去。每当这种时候，她都会疑惑，那个在战争初期她初次接触时还乐呵呵的醉汉，究竟去了哪里。眼罩提醒她，就在她初次战败并随后被第九使徒感染之后，世界变得不再有逻辑。“随你怎么说。一个月后再见吧，希望你别死了。”

A shrug of the woman's stiff shoulders was the closest she got to an actual reaction. "Get some actual food in you," Misato said in a quieter, almost regretful tone. "Take a breath… go spend some time with Kensuke and Hikari. I don't… I'm not sure what's going to happen if and when NERV decides to activate Unit 13 again."  
女人僵硬的肩膀微微一耸，这已是最接近实际反应的举动。“吃点真正的食物吧，”美里用更轻柔、几乎带着悔意的语气说道，“喘口气……去和健介和光一起待会儿。我不……我不确定如果 NERV 再次决定启动 13 号机，会发生什么。”

The portentous warning rang heavy in the already dense air of the foul-smelling quarters; it reeked of dirty clothes and spilled sake. It would seem the timer had been set and already ticking. "Like I can taste anything anymore," she ground out angrily, arms going to her sides as her hands curled into fits. "Good luck."  
那不祥的警告声在原本就污浊不堪、恶臭扑鼻的街区中回荡，空气中弥漫着脏衣服和洒出的清酒的臭味。仿佛计时器已被设定，且已经开始倒数。“好像我还能尝出什么味道似的，”她愤怒地咬牙切齿，双臂垂向两侧，双手紧握成拳。“祝你好运。”

The sarcasm in her voice was as heavy as the gloom ambient in the secluded space.  
她话语中的讽刺意味与这隐秘空间里的阴郁氛围一样沉重。

"Asuka." The woman's words froze her in her steps; for once in years she registered some level of instability in Misato's voice. "Take care of yourself, and… _sigh_… if you can, take care of him."  
"明日香。" 女人的话语让她脚步一滞；多年来，她首次从美里口中听出了几分不稳。"照顾好自己，还有……叹气……如果可以，照顾好他。"

"It's not my job to mommy stupid brats, go get him a babysitter or a mother if you want that," was her clipped, bitten response. "Whatever happens, happens. Do you want me to change his clothes and wipe his ass, too? Because I'm not doing that."  
我可不是来照顾那些蠢小鬼的，要找保姆或妈妈的话，你自己去找吧，" 她冷冷地回应道。"无论发生什么，就让它发生吧。你难道还想让我给他换衣服擦屁股吗？因为我可不干这个。

Unbeknownst to her, a small, knowing smile drew itself on Misato's lips. "Those cuffs, you put them on a little bit too tight, you know. He sat with them on his wrists for about a day and a half." The smirk widened. "Try not to kill my prisoner in the following weeks, will you?"  
她并不知情，Misato 嘴角勾起了一抹微妙的笑意。"那些手铐，你扣得有点太紧了，知道吗？他手腕上戴了差不多一天半。" 笑容更甚。"接下来的几周里，别把我的犯人弄死了，好吗？"

The redhead shook her head, chuckling despite the acrimonious atmosphere of the room. "No promises," she responded as the door opened. "You're planning on using him again, aren't you?"  
红发女子摇了摇头，尽管房间内气氛尖锐，她仍轻声笑了出来。“不作承诺。”她回答道，此时门打开了。“你打算再次利用他，对吧？”

"If it comes down to it, maybe," Asuka recognized the sound of the beverage being consumed in heavy gulps behind her back. "You have your orders. He's a prisoner, not a guest. Protocol is expected…" Again, for the second time in a day, for the second time in years, Misato's voice broke. "Just put the tazer at minimum… if it comes down to it."  
如果真到了那一步，或许吧，" 明日香听出身后传来饮料被大口吞咽的声音。"你有你的命令。他是囚犯，不是客人。规矩是要遵守的……" 又一次，一天之内，也是多年来的第二次，美里声音哽咽了。"只要把电击枪调到最低档……如果真到了那一步。

"Like the idiot's ever going to voluntarily set foot on this damn ship ever again," with another shake of her head, Asuka readjusted the hat resting on her head and pushed her fists deep into the jacket pockets.  
"那个傻瓜怎么可能还会自愿踏上这该死的船，" 明日香再次摇头，调整了一下头上的帽子，将双手深深插进夹克口袋里。

She walked into the hallway and went about collecting their prisoner; the small window for an unsuspected drop off was drawing near. The thought of being back in the village produced nothing in her but more frustration; she could very well provide assistance in any way possible during the mission to Paris, but instead their trusted commander in chief had chosen to give her some vacation time after years and years of being at the ready. _What a freaking joke,_ she thought while striding towards the cell, incensed. _Get some real food in me, stupid hag. Like she doesn't know food doesn't taste anymore. Like she doesn't know I'd prefer to do literally anything other than go back to the village. Awesome, now I get a month of people staring at me like I'm a freak. I get a month of making sure that stupid little brat doesn't kill himself, or that the stupid Rei clone doesn't dissolve into nothing. Awesome. Fantastic._  
她走进走廊，开始去押解他们的囚犯；那个不为人知的秘密交接的小窗口时间即将来临。一想到要回到村子，她心中只有更多的沮丧；在前往巴黎的任务中，她完全可以以任何可能的方式提供帮助，但多年来一直随时待命的她，却被他们信赖的总指挥官安排了休假时间。真是个该死的笑话，她一边大步走向牢房，一边愤怒地想。给我来点真正的食物吧，愚蠢的老太婆。好像她不知道食物已经没有味道了似的。好像她不知道我宁愿做任何其他事情，也不愿回到村子。太棒了，现在我要忍受一个月人们像看怪物一样盯着我。我要确保那个愚蠢的小鬼不会自残，或者那个愚蠢的零号克隆体不会化为乌有。太棒了。太美妙了。

Many of the crew members were displeased with the latest update on their prisoner; the fun little show of watching him suffer was about to get cancelled and their wishes for violent, tasteless retaliation were to be left unfulfilled. To her knowledge not a single one of them had had the chance to direct their anger directly into the Third Child's feeble physique. None had been granted the opportunity to express their frustrations, none but her; the very recollection of elbowing him or punching him in the gut made her want to wash her hands. She had waited more than a decade for a chance to express her frustration and when the occasion had arisen, the aftermath had left her feeling empty and repulsed.  
许多船员对囚犯的最新动态感到不满；原本观赏他受苦的小娱乐即将被取消，他们那些暴力且无味的报复愿望也将无法实现。据她所知，他们中没有一个人有机会将愤怒直接发泄到这位第三子的脆弱身体上。没有人得到过宣泄不满的机会，除了她；每当回想起用肘击或拳打他的腹部，她就有种想洗手的冲动。她等待了十多年才得以发泄心中的怨气，而当机会来临时，事后的空虚和厌恶感却让她难以承受。

She recognized the steps nearing her own and groaned in advance. "What do you want, Four-Eyes?"  
她听到了逐渐靠近的脚步声，提前发出了叹息。“你想要什么，四眼？”

"You don't have to be so cold!" A pair of slender arms went over her neck as Mari held her in a loose hug; Asuka did not even bother to remove her hands from her jacket pockets or stop walking for that matter. "This might be the last time we talk, you know," green eyes narrowed knowingly at her as they moved through the ship and the redhead refused to reciprocate the hug in the slightest.  
"你不必这么冷漠！" 玛丽的一双纤细手臂环过她的脖子，松松地拥抱着她；明日香连手都没从夹克口袋里抽出来，更别提停下脚步了。"你知道的，这可能是我们最后一次谈话了，" 那双绿眼睛带着几分了然盯着她，而她们在船上穿行时，红发女孩丝毫没有回应拥抱的意思。

"Pff, as if I'd ever get so lucky," retorted the Second Child with a frown and a shrug. "It's not an overly impossible mission, you'll manage just fine." Her eye narrowed when she recalled the pitiful state of her Unit 02 and the fact that she would be in the company of the culprit of said damage for the better part of her day. "Just try to conserve your ammo and be at firing distance, they're not impossible concepts to grasp, even for a four-eyed nutcase like you."  
哼，我哪有那么幸运，" 第二适格者皱着眉头反驳道，耸了耸肩。"任务并不算太难，你能应付得来。" 她想起自己的二号机那可怜的状态，以及一整天都要与造成这损害的罪魁祸首为伴，眼神不由得一紧。"只要尽量节省弹药，保持射击距离，这些概念并不难理解，即便是你这样的四眼怪胎。

"Ohh, a vote of confidence from the Princess!" said the girl, clutching her tighter and almost forcing them both to trip. "Don't worry, I won't let you down! It's weird not to work as a team, wouldn't you say?"  
“哦，公主的信任投票！”女孩说着，紧紧抱住她，差点让两人都绊倒。“别担心，我不会让你失望的！不一起工作感觉很奇怪，你不觉得吗？”

"Whatever. Sure, a team. Gonna be weird, I suppose." she grumbled. Both female pilots stopped walking; to their right was the gate of Shinji's cell. Pity, how she had arrived at the damn cage so quickly, or how the hours had passed without her noticing. "For what it's worth, don't die."  
“随便吧。当然，一个团队。应该会很奇怪。”她咕哝着。两位女飞行员停下了脚步；在她们右边是真嗣的牢房大门。真可惜，她这么快就到了这该死的牢笼，或者时间是如何在她不知不觉中流逝的。“不管怎样，别死了。”

"I won't," with a final tug Mari blessedly uncoiled from her frame and stood a few feet away. She noticed the girl's gaze fixed on the metallic door with sadness dancing in her eyes. "He's been through a lot, you know."  
“我不会的，”玛丽终于从她的框架中解脱出来，站在几英尺远的地方。她注意到女孩的目光悲伤地凝视着那扇金属门。“他经历了很多，你知道的。”

The comment earned her nothing but a snarl and managed to reignite the anger in Asuka's core with frightening efficiency. "Yeah, poor little brat, been through a lot almost blowing all of us to shit twice, poor little thing, been through a lot leaving with the enemy like an idiot and fighting _against_ me. Yeah," her fists tightened within the jacket. "Poor little Shinji."  
这句话只换来了一声咆哮，并惊人地迅速重新点燃了明日香内心的怒火。“是啊，可怜的小鬼，经历了那么多，差点两次把我们都炸成碎片，可怜的小东西，像个白痴一样和敌人一起离开，还和我作对。是啊，”她的拳头在夹克里紧握。“可怜的小真嗣。”

"That time, not too long ago," Mari mentioned as she turned and starting walking away. "After fourteen years of not even a spike in activity, Unit 01 broke free and destroyed that Angel." The redhead's frown deepened; she did not want to recall that particular event in the slightest. "I bet he's… pretty lonely, Princess." Out of the corner of her eye, the Second Child noticed the other girl's shoulders slacken to a degree. "I think you of all people can understand what that does to someone. Take care, please."  
那次，就在不久前，"玛丽转身开始走开时说道，"十四年来毫无动静的零号机突然失控，摧毁了那个使徒。"红发女孩的眉头皱得更深了；她一点也不想回忆那次事件。"我猜他……一定很孤独，公主。"她眼角的余光注意到另一个女孩的肩膀微微下垂。"我想你最能理解这会对一个人造成什么影响。请保重。

Before she could articulate a biting, resentful comment the other girl sprinted away, flashing the knowing little smirk she detested so much along with a peace sign as she moved towards her station and prepared for deployment. She growled low in her throat; Four-Eyes' parting words had cut a bit too deeply, and now besides anger she now felt a sour taste in her mouth and a gaping hole in her chest. _God damn it…_ It had been foolish to mark that particular word in the dictionary, as well. If Shinji ever dared to pity her, she would be more than willing to castigate his foolishness with violence, regardless of how sick it made her feel afterwards.  
在她能说出一句尖锐怨恨的话之前，另一个女孩已经飞奔而去，留下她最讨厌的那种意味深长的微笑，还伴随着一个和平手势，朝着自己的岗位跑去准备出击。她低声咆哮；四眼临别的话刺痛了她，除了愤怒，现在她的嘴里还有一种苦涩的味道，胸口仿佛空了一个大洞。该死的……在字典里特意标注那个词也是愚蠢之举。如果真嗣敢同情她，她会毫不犹豫地用暴力斥责他的愚蠢，尽管事后会让她感到多么不适。

Asuka checked the clock on her new suit; the Plugsuit was her uniform and whilst on the vessel she felt naked without it. _Half an hour until dropoff,_ she mused, took a deep breath to ease the wrath corroding her thoughts and pressed her ID card on the door, already expecting the worst as it opened with a hiss.  
明日香检查了新驾驶服上的时钟；这套插入栓服是她的制服，在船上时她总觉得不穿它就像赤身裸体一样。她暗自思忖，还有半小时就要降落了，深吸一口气以平息心中腐蚀性的愤怒，然后将 ID 卡按在门上，已经做好了最坏的准备，门嘶的一声打开了。

In a vast contrast of her expectations Shinji sat on cell's small cot fully dressed, elbows on his knees and head low, staring at the ground with a somehow not so disconnected expression as the day prior. He held the SDAT with both hands while the dictionary rested on his lap, closed. She was surprised to see the little buds not stuck to his ears for once; the redhead walked into the cell and strode towards the prisoner until the distance between them all but vanished. The annoyance started to build up as the seconds passed and he stayed there, immobile. Just as she was about to kick his leg to get a reaction, Shinji spoke.  
与她的预期形成鲜明对比的是，真嗣坐在牢房的小床上，全身穿戴整齐，双肘撑在膝上，头低垂着，目光凝视地面，与前一天相比，他的表情并不显得那么疏离。他双手握着 SDAT，字典则合拢放在膝上。她惊讶地发现他这次没有把耳机塞在耳朵里；红发少女走进牢房，径直走向囚犯，直到两人之间的距离几乎消失。随着时间的流逝，他依然一动不动，这让她的恼怒逐渐升起。正当她准备踢他的腿以引起反应时，真嗣开口了。

"Hey, Asuka," he whispered, almost imperceptibly. The cut on his forehead had been washed and dried, leaving the reddish and jagged wound obscured by his hair to an extent. "I guess we're… going, now?"  
“嘿，明日香，”他低声说道，几乎难以察觉。他额头上的伤口已被清洗并晾干，留下那道红色锯齿状的伤痕，在发丝的遮掩下显得不那么明显。“我想我们……现在要走了？”

"Get up. There's not a lot of time." She bit back as her glare settled on his head. "As soon as we land you'll get that disgusting cut looked after again. Move."  
“起来。时间不多了。”她咬牙切齿地说，目光锁定在他的头上。“我们一落地，你就得再去处理那令人作呕的伤口。动起来。”

Half-expecting to be forced to drag him once more, Asuka was a bit surprised to see the Third Child nod slightly and lift himself off the cot. He was not looking as gaunt anymore, she noticed, and felt a strange sense of satisfaction upon seeing two empty trays near the metallic chair. If she had to guess the fever was very much present but milder, he looked solid enough on his feet to walk unassisted and in enough of a frame of mind to understand words and commands. _Wonder how long that's going to last,_ she pondered sarcastically.  
阿斯卡半是期待地准备再次拖着他走，却有些惊讶地看到第三适格者微微点头，自己从床上坐了起来。她注意到，他不再显得那么憔悴，看到金属椅旁两个空盘子，她感到一种莫名的满足。如果她没猜错，他的高烧应该还在，但有所减轻，他看起来站得稳稳的，能够独立行走，并且足够清醒，能理解话语和命令。她讽刺地想，不知道这种情况能持续多久。

The backpack she had been carrying was presented to the idiot. "Put that stuff in here," ordered the female pilot, and felt a pang of self-disgust arise when she realized what she had to do next. It did not help matters at all to see a light frown obscure Shinji's features at the thought of parting with the book and his little music box. "You can keep that stupid black thing in your pocket. Put the book in here, you can have it after we land. Don't waste my time, _move_."  
她一直背着的背包被递给了那个傻瓜。“把那些东西放进来，”女飞行员命令道，当她意识到接下来必须做什么时，心中涌起一阵自我厌恶。看到真嗣因为要与书和音乐盒分开而眉头微皱，这丝毫没有改善局面。“你可以把那愚蠢的黑色东西放在口袋里。把书放进来，着陆后你可以拿回去。别浪费我的时间，快点。”

It made the Major feel uncomfortable and dissatisfied to see him look over at the stupid dictionary with some sense of fondness, as though the stupid book meant anything at all, before he delicately placed it in the bag and stored away the SDAT. Rage boiled deep in her belly, for once not directed at him or her enemies, Four-Eyes or Misato. The very sight of the bandages on Shinji's arm made her sick to her stomach; she swallowed down whatever strange emotions were faintly bubbling through her anger and closed the bag. "Your hands," ground out the young woman through gritted teeth. "You know the drill, you're a prisoner. I have to cuff you."  
看到他带着一丝眷恋地瞥向那本愚蠢的词典，仿佛那本书有什么意义似的，然后小心翼翼地将它放入包中，收起了 SDAT，这让少校感到不舒服和不满意。怒火在她腹中翻腾，这一次并非针对他或她的敌人，眼镜四眼或美里。看到真嗣手臂上的绷带，她感到一阵恶心；她咽下了那些在愤怒中隐约涌动的奇怪情绪，合上了背包。“你的手，”年轻女子咬牙切齿地说道。“你知道规矩，你是囚犯。我必须给你戴上手铐。”

Wordlessly he extended both arms, hands curled into half-fists with the palms facing up as she had instructed. This time around she was careful to set the metal rings as loosely as possible and brutally suppressed a strange urge to… apologize… when Shinji grimaced in pain as the cuff rubbed against the healing wound. The cracking of the Entry Plug around her always served as a fueling agent to drown out feelings she did not care to deal with, so why did its efficiency wane that particular day as her covered hands grazed over the bandages?  
他默默地伸出双臂，双手蜷成半拳状，掌心朝上，正如她所指示的那样。这一次，她小心翼翼地将金属环设置得尽可能松，当真嗣因手铐摩擦愈合的伤口而痛苦地皱眉时，她残忍地压制住了一种奇怪的道歉冲动。插入栓在她周围裂开的声音总是作为一种燃料，用来淹没那些她不愿面对的情感，那么为什么在那天，当她戴着手套的手拂过绷带时，这种效率会减弱呢？

_This is ridiculous, he's barely even able to get up. What, he's gonna run all the way to Unit 01 now, when he's barely able to stand on his own damn feet?_ Just thinking about Misato's latest command made her shake her head in derision; she honestly expected her to electrocute the Third Child if he somehow voluntarily stepped back in the vessel. "Let's go."  
这太荒谬了，他几乎连站都站不起来。什么，他现在要一路跑到零号机那里去吗，当他连自己的脚都站不稳的时候？只要一想到美里最新的命令，她就忍不住摇头嘲笑；她真的以为她会用电击第三适格者，如果他自愿回到驾驶舱的话。“我们走吧。”

She did not wait for a reply, the redhead started walking towards the exit, hands back in her jacket pockets and glare firmly set in place. They were to walk a small distance to the one of the WUNDER's hangars, take a smaller vessel and reach the village in less than an hour. It was a tricky, difficult operation and should not even be considered. The ship's resources were about to be replenished if the mission in Paris succeeded, after all, and the meager amounts Shinji consumed represented closed to nothing for their stock. Something told her Misato was taking the chance for more obvious reasons, completely unrelated to their rations or the energy it took to keep the Third Child alive in his sad little cell.  
她没有等待答复，红发女子便径直向出口走去，双手插回夹克口袋，目光坚定不移。他们将步行一小段距离到达 WUNDER 的一个机库，搭乘一艘小型飞船，不到一小时就能抵达村庄。这是一项棘手且艰难的任务，本不应被考虑。毕竟，如果巴黎的任务成功，飞船的资源即将得到补充，而真嗣所消耗的那点微不足道的物资对他们库存来说几乎可以忽略不计。某种直觉告诉她，美里之所以抓住这个机会，是出于更为明显的原因，与他们的口粮或维持第三少年在其悲惨小囚室中生存所需的能量完全无关。

_He's in danger here,_ Asuka pondered lazily as she walked through the halls and saw the incensed, hateful glares the crew members directed at Shinji. He walked a few steps behind her; Asuka's eye moved left and right, registering cold indifference, anger, hatred and the desire for bloody retaliation. _At some point, someone's bound to get the security codes for the cell and do something stupid. Any more time spent here will only increase the chances of it happening._  
他在这里有危险，明日香懒洋洋地思索着，她穿过走廊，注意到船员们对真嗣投来的愤怒与憎恨的目光。他跟在她身后几步远；明日香的目光左右移动，察觉到冷漠、愤怒、仇恨以及血腥报复的欲望。总有一天，会有人设法获取囚室的安保密码，做出愚蠢的举动。在这里多待一刻，只会增加这种事情发生的可能性。

In the state he was in, the boy probably only felt half of the pulsing hatred and anger clouding the hallways. Thankfully enough not a single member of the WUNDER had bothered to say a thing. Sakura had been too busy with the preparations for the mission in France, so not even Suzuhara's little sister had had a chance to say whatever it is she wanted to communicate to him. _Good riddance,_ she thought, breathing a slight sigh of relief when the hangar came into view. Her eye turned back to confirm the idiot was still walking behind her, head bowed, bound hands in front of him and eyes fixed on the ground. _And now I'm stuck with this damn brat. Some vacation you gave me, Misato._  
以他当时的状态，男孩或许只感受到了走廊中涌动的仇恨与愤怒的一半。幸好，WUNDER 的成员们无一开口打扰。Sakura 正忙于准备法国的任务，连铃原的妹妹也没机会向他传达她想说的话。她暗自庆幸，当看到机库时，轻轻舒了口气。她回头确认那傻瓜还跟在后面，低着头，双手被缚，目光紧盯地面。现在我却被这该死的小子拖累。你给我的这算什么假期，美里。

Once they both stopped at the hangar's gate Asuka noticed him shiver from head to toe for the third time, and growled low in her throat. The temperature was descending indeed, and once the hangar's gates opened the cold wind was going to hit them directly and all the brat was wearing was a very thin white shirt which would do absolutely nothing to keep the cold air from getting into his lungs and worsening his already compromised health. _God damn it._  
当两人停在机库门前，明日香注意到他第三次从头到脚地颤抖，喉咙里低低地咆哮了一声。气温确实在下降，一旦机库大门打开，寒风将直接扑面而来，而这小子只穿着一件非常单薄的白衬衫，根本无法抵御寒气侵入肺部，使他本已不佳的健康状况雪上加霜。该死。

She noticed Midori standing to their right, occasionally stealing heated glances at the boy in cuffs; she had a quite comfortable looking military jacket slung across her shoulder, one she could most definitely have replaced in the ship. Asuka turned to the Third Child and pointed to the bound hands. "Hurry it up, the ship's almost ready."  
她注意到美里站在他们右边，不时偷偷瞥向那戴着手铐的男孩；她肩上搭着一件看起来颇为舒适的军装外套，显然是从船上换来的。明日香转向第三适格者，指了指被铐住的双手。“快点，船快准备好了。”

The cuffs were removed in a haste; she wanted nothing else than to toss them as physically away from her as possible. The seemingly harmless object arose nothing but nausea and wrath in her being. As she retrieved them, Asuka felt Shinji's heated skin under her covered palm and grumbled. "Stupid brat," she muttered while unzipping her jacket. Before the male pilot could grasp what was happening the redhead had already covered his shivering form with the red garment. "Do I have to freaking put it on you, too?"  
手铐匆忙被解开；她只想尽快将这东西远远扔开，仿佛它只会唤起她内心的恶心与愤怒。当她取回手铐时，明日香感受到真嗣滚烫的皮肤透过她覆盖的手掌，低声抱怨道：“笨蛋小子。”她一边嘀咕，一边拉开夹克的拉链。还没等男驾驶员反应过来，红发少女已经用那件红色外套裹住了他颤抖的身体。“难道我还要帮你穿上不成？”

It annoyed her how he seemed to wake from a lucid dream, blinking heavily, and then gazed at the damn thing like it was a precious gift before he nodded and pushed his arms into the sleeves. Asuka rolled her eyes. "God damn you wasting my damn time, you idiot." She yanked the jacket's edges in her direction and closed the zipper all the way up to his throat, covering the DSS choker.  
他似乎从一场清晰的梦中醒来，重重地眨着眼，然后凝视着那该死的东西，仿佛它是珍贵的礼物，随后点头将双臂伸进袖子。明日香翻了个白眼。“该死的，你浪费我的时间，白痴。”她将夹克边缘拽向自己，拉上拉链直至他的喉咙，遮住了 DSS 项圈。

"Weather's about to get really cold in here," she growled at him, frowning and doing her best to avoid looking at his slightly disconnected gaze. "And with that stupid fever your idiocy just brought about, ugh…" The inflammation and cut around his forehead came into view; she removed the cap and forcefully placed on the boy's head, almost smacking him with her palm. She made sure the bruise was well covered under the cap's soft material. "There. Don't you dare puke all over my jacket, and you better not let that cap fly off, you hear me?"  
“这里天气马上就要变得很冷了，”她对他咆哮道，皱着眉头尽力避免看他那略显茫然的目光。“再加上你这愚蠢的发烧，真是……”她看到了他额头上的红肿和伤口；她摘下帽子，用力扣在那男孩头上，差点用手掌拍他。她确保那瘀伤被帽子柔软的材质遮盖得严严实实。“好了。别把我的夹克吐得一塌糊涂，也别让那帽子飞掉，听到了吗？”

Once the boy had produced that slow, detached nod of his the Second Child turned and marched over to the pink-haired crew member. She placed one hand on her hip and pointed towards the woman's coat. "I'm going to need that." Stated the Major with authority, and tried her best not to smirk when the woman's expression became scandalized. "Come on, hurry up! It's about to get freaking cold in here!"  
男孩缓缓地、漠然地点了点头，二子转身大步走向那位粉红头发的机组人员。她一手叉腰，指向那女人的外套。“我需要那件。”少校以权威的口吻说道，并尽力忍住不笑，当看到那女人的表情变得惊愕时。“快点，赶紧的！这里马上就要变得冷得要命了！”

"Why should that be _my_ problem, Major?" Kitamaki snapped back and held the green garment closer to her chest. "You shouldn't have given your own stuff to the prisoner then!"  
“为什么这该是我的问题，少校？”北卷反驳道，将那件绿色外套紧紧抱在胸前。“你当初就不该把自己的东西给囚犯！”

Rolling her eye in slight frustration, Asuka wasted no more time and ripped the jacket off the woman's hold before she could react or further protest. "You can get a replacement in the main hall. Where I'm going, even clothes are limited so stop your whining. Get the ship's gate open and start the engines. We have a window of nineteen minutes starting now."  
阿斯卡略带烦躁地翻了个白眼，不再浪费时间，一把从女人手中扯过夹克，让她来不及反应或进一步抗议。“你可以在主厅换一件新的。我要去的地方，连衣服都有限，别再抱怨了。打开船闸，启动引擎。我们现在有十九分钟的时间窗口。”

Her penetrating glare most likely silenced the woman's next complaint and without giving her much of a choice to retaliate or further protest, she had already turned her back and was putting the jacket on as she walked. Shinji was beginning to look more and more disconnected, so instead of dealing with his slow reactions, Asuka grasped his uninjured wrist, hoisted the duffle bag on her shoulder and began to hastily walk towards the smaller VTOL designated to deliver both them and much needed medical supplies to the village.  
她那锐利的目光很可能已经让女人闭上了嘴，没有给她太多反击或继续抗议的机会，阿斯卡已经转身，边走边穿上夹克。真嗣看起来越来越心不在焉，所以阿斯卡没有理会他迟缓的反应，而是抓住他未受伤的手腕，将帆布包扛在肩上，匆忙向那架指定运送他们和急需医疗物资到村庄的小型垂直起降飞机走去。

The hangar gate opened and a gust of frigid wind threw her hair into disarray; the Major had been half-expecting to permanently part with the stupid hat as it was to most likely fly off Shinji's head, releasing her of the illogical attachment to the garment at long last. The boy's left hand flew over to it, however, keeping it in place as she dragged them both along. They climbed on the VTOL just as the wind began to pick up; the little brat almost tripped over his own feet as they went up the steps. Once aboard she almost pushed him into his seat and went to the opposite side of the vessel, sitting as far away from him as possible.  
机库门开启，一阵寒风猛地将她的头发吹得凌乱；少校本以为那顶愚蠢的帽子会像往常一样从真嗣头上飞走，从而让她终于摆脱对这件衣物的不合理依恋。然而，男孩的左手迅速伸向帽子，稳稳地固定住，任由她拽着两人前行。他们登上垂直起降机时，风势开始增强；那小鬼差点在登梯时绊倒自己。一上机，她几乎将他推到座位上，然后走到船舱另一侧，尽可能远离他坐下。

"Strap yourself to your seat." Came the biting command as she walked away. "Otherwise you'll end up splattered all over the ship." _And stop playing with the roundels, you idiot._ She noticed how after obeying her orders and securing the straps around his body in a mechanic fashion, Shinji's hand occasionally went up to the cap, specifically to the two pins stuck to it. Even with his eyes half-focused and glazed, his fingertips would trace over the biggest one and make the unease in her belly turn into the anger she was so familiar with. _Whatever, the brat stopped shaking so I guess there's that. How nice of him to get freaking sick on top of everything else._  
"把自己固定在座位上。"她冷冷地命令道，随即转身离开。"不然你会被甩得满船都是。"还有，别再玩那些徽章了，你这个白痴。她注意到，在机械地遵从命令，将安全带绕过身体固定好后，真嗣的手时不时会伸向帽子，尤其是那两个别在上面的别针。尽管眼神半迷离，他的指尖仍会抚过最大的那个，让她的不安转化为熟悉的愤怒。算了，这小子不再发抖了，也算是个进步。真有他的，居然还在这种时候吐得一塌糊涂。

Having spent almost five days without eating and barely drinking, the wound she had provided and its decay under infection were just a part of his current state. Only a day before had the Third Child begun to speak and respond, and even then, strapped to his seat and occasionally making sure the cap did not fall off his head he looked unwell enough to most likely fall into another catatonic state at any given moment. There was evidence of the damage from the near Third Impact almost everywhere in the village; life was difficult but possible, achievable with enough hard work.  
几乎五天未进食，仅勉强饮水，她所造成的伤口及其在感染下的溃烂仅是他当前状况的一部分。直到前一天，第三子才开始说话并有所反应，即便如此，被绑在座位上，不时确保帽子不从头上掉落，他的状态看起来糟糕到随时可能再次陷入紧张性精神病发作。村庄各处都可见到近似第三次冲击带来的破坏痕迹；生活虽艰难，但凭借足够的辛勤努力，仍有可能实现。

_His weak little mind is probably going to crack like an egg after he's seen a thing or two._ The thought did not sit well with her; the more the idiot's mental state decayed the more useless he'd become, and she truly had no desire to keep him from starving himself or dying in some stupid way. What did she expect to get from him? What sort of punishment was she referring to? _Literally anything other than blindly doing what he's told and majorly messing up the world every time he doesn't, literally anything other than that would be a good start. Pff, fat chance of that. Look at him. What a waste, I should've just let him rot in that cage. Take a breath. Yeah right, Misato. Now I get to walk around dragging this freaking brat around like I'm what, a service dog or something?! All because the idiot chose to go and blow the world to he- what the hell is so damn fascinating about a pin, idiot?!_  
他那脆弱的小脑袋瓜，估计见多识广后就会像鸡蛋一样裂开。这念头让她颇为不快；那蠢货的心智越是衰退，他就越是无用，而她确实没兴趣阻止他饿死自己或以某种愚蠢的方式丧命。她指望从他身上得到什么？她所指的惩罚又是什么？只要不是盲目听从指令，每次不听话就严重搞砸一切，任何其他表现都算是个好的开始。噗，想得美。瞧瞧他那副德行。真是废物，我早该让他烂在那笼子里。深呼吸。说得轻巧，美里。现在倒好，我得拖着这该死的小鬼四处走，像个什么，导盲犬之类的？！全因那蠢货选择把世界炸个底朝天——见鬼，一枚别针有什么好稀罕的，蠢货？！

Asuka had been on the verge of getting up and retrieving the cap when the VTOL began to move and the sound of the engines consumed everything else. Shinji stopped playing with the pins at long last and instead focused on keeping the cap in place once more; the wind was quite unforgiving in the area they were to descend, so turbulence was expected. Soon enough the aircraft was swinging and shaking, metal wailed but held in place whilst the descent began. There was no turning back now. She was to spend a month or more secluded in the damned village and had the _wonderful_ company of the boy whose inaction had cost her an eye, years of her life, a curse on her body and a miserable, rage-filled existence.  
明日香正要起身去取帽子，这时垂直起降机开始移动，引擎的轰鸣声吞噬了一切。真嗣终于停止了玩弄别针，转而再次专注于固定帽子；他们即将降落的地方风势异常无情，因此预计会有颠簸。很快，飞机开始摇摆震动，金属发出哀鸣却依然稳固，下降过程开始了。现在已无回头之路。她将在这个该死的村庄里隐居一个月甚至更久，陪伴她的，是那个因无所作为而让她失去一只眼睛、数年光阴、身体上被施以诅咒以及充满痛苦与愤怒生活的男孩。

A second large tremor shook the ship and she watched the Third Child hold onto both the seat and the cap for dear life. _You're overthinking this,_ she decided, and turned away to observe how the sky ever so slowly changed from crimson to a light blue. _You ordered him to not let the stupid cap fly off, and like the good little boy he is, he's doing what he's told. Well, I guess it's better than him not moving at all. Need to keep that stupid fever under control, I don't have the patience to deal with Suzuhara right now._  
又一次剧烈震动撼动了船身，她看着三子拼命抓住座椅和帽子。你这是想太多了，她暗自决定，转过身去观察天空如何缓缓地从深红转为淡蓝。你命令他不许让那顶蠢帽子飞走，而他就像个听话的小男孩，照做了。好吧，我想总比他一动不动强。得控制住那该死的高烧，我现在可没耐心应付铃原。

The memory of the last battle was still very present in her mind, the rage and sense of betrayal deep-rooted in her chest reignited to an extent when she recalled the massive damage Unit 02 had suffered. She tried to stay angry, tried to deny everything else, but even through the jacket the white material of the bandages was glaring at her and reminding her how that cut had been produced in the first place, or how she had waited four days to open the cell gate and see if the idiot was still breathing. Left with nothing but her thoughts and the buzzing of the engines, Asuka crossed her arms and wondered why, exactly, she had given him her cap and jacket in the first place.  
最后一战的记忆在她脑海中依旧鲜明，每当回想起 02 号机所遭受的重创，她胸中的愤怒与背叛感便如根深蒂固般重新燃起。她试图保持愤怒，试图否认一切其他情感，但即便隔着夹克，绷带那白色的材质依然刺眼地提醒着她，那道伤口是如何造成的，或是她如何等待了四天才打开牢门，看看那傻瓜是否还在呼吸。只剩下思绪与引擎的嗡鸣作伴，明日香交叉双臂，思索着究竟为何，她当初会把帽子和夹克给了他。

Shinji, for his part, realized that not only was reality starting to make some semblance of sense once more, his senses were returning in droplets. The sensations of cold, heat and illness were now quite perceptible, his very bones ached due to the infection and he felt constantly exhausted and feeble. He had been on the verge of dropping into a fit of tremors before Asuka… the jacket had still been warm as she placed it around him. Feeling such warmth had caught him completely off guard, and just as he was about to ask why she would ever do something for someone she wanted dead or punished, the cap had been pushed on his head.  
真嗣这边，他意识到现实不仅开始再次呈现出些许合理性，他的感官也在点滴恢复。寒冷、炎热和病痛的感觉如今变得相当明显，感染让他的骨头都隐隐作痛，他感到持续的疲惫和虚弱。在明日香……那件外套披在他身上时，他几乎要陷入一阵颤抖之中。外套还带着她的余温。这份温暖让他完全措手不及，正当他准备问她为何会为一个她希望死去或受罚的人做这样的事时，帽子被扣在了他的头上。

_Strawberries…_ His sense of smell had apparently also decided to manifest; he breathed in with every turbulence and was transported back to that night; it probably felt like an eternity ago for Asuka, yet for him the memory was as fresh as his recollection of taking out of the thrice-damned Angel. The scent was almost the same as that night. LCL and strawberries mingled with something he did not quite identify, yet familiar all the same; the boy chose to ignore the pain coming from his wrist and kept the left hand holding the cap firmly in place. _I'd… like to see those pins._ Had he been able to smile, he would have; the red one with the skull was particularly interesting. The red and the eyepatch had not gone unnoticed, after all; his ability to perceive and process thoughts was also coming back.  
草莓……他的嗅觉显然也恢复了；每一次呼吸都让他回想起那个夜晚；对明日香来说或许感觉像是遥远的过去，但对他而言，那记忆却如同刚刚击退那该死三次的使徒一样清晰。那晚的香气几乎如出一辙。LCL 与草莓混合着某种他未能完全辨认却又熟悉的味道；男孩选择忽略手腕上传来的疼痛，紧紧用左手握住帽子。我……想看看那些别针。如果他能笑的话，他会的；那个带有骷髅图案的红色别针特别有趣。红色和眼罩并未被忽视，毕竟；他的感知和思维处理能力也在逐渐恢复。

Guilt and anguish were already boiling inside his ribcage, making his gut feel empty and hollow, and the sheer weight of his foolishness was crushing his shoulders. Asuka's glare never receded either; at least caught inside his own mind, the feeling of her wrath and disgust had not been so overly penetrating.  
内疚与痛苦已在胸腔内沸腾，让他的腹部感到空虚和空洞，愚蠢的沉重负担压垮了他的肩膀。明日香的瞪视也从未消退；至少在他自己的内心世界里，她的愤怒和厌恶感没有那么强烈地渗透进来。

The flight felt longer than the two hours it took to reach the ground; the silence stretched, making the redhead's anger spike and Shinji's misery expand into his consciousness.  
这段飞行感觉比实际到达地面的两小时还要漫长；沉默不断蔓延，使得红发少女的怒火愈发高涨，而真嗣的痛苦也逐渐侵蚀他的意识。

Once the aircraft landed Asuka wasted no time in instructing him to get up, and just as the Third Child was on his feet she grabbed onto his uninjured hand and pushed him out the VTOL with a bit too much force, almost forcing Shinji to fall flat on his face. The anger was not letting her act, or rather… whatever she was trying to stifle with the anger was ever so slowly refusing to be denied. She picked both the backpack and a much heavier package filled with medical supplies and jumped off the airship in a rush.  
飞机一着陆，明日香便迫不及待地命令他起身，就在第三适格者站稳之际，她抓住他未受伤的手，用力将他推出垂直起降机，差点让真嗣摔个狗啃泥。愤怒并未让她失去理智，或者更确切地说……她试图用愤怒压抑的某种情感，正缓慢而坚定地拒绝被忽视。她拿起背包和装满医疗用品的重包裹，急匆匆地跳下飞船。

For the Third Child the push brought the world back into focus; he recognized green grass under his feet and clean air entering his lungs; the VTOL took off merely seconds after they departed and drew his eyes to the sky. It was… blue, like Asuka had said. "What… where am I…?"  
对于第三适格者来说，这一推让他重新聚焦了世界；他认出了脚下的绿草和吸入肺中的清新空气；垂直起降机在他们离开后仅几秒钟就起飞了，将他的目光引向天空。天空是……蓝色的，正如明日香所说。“这是……我在哪儿……？”

"Somewhere that doesn't stink of blood," elucidated the Second Child and pushed her fisted hands into the large military coat. "Told you the sky would be blue, didn't I? This is a place where the Lilim can live without a respirator mask. Let's go, I want to get out of this suit."  
“一个没有血腥味的地方。”第二适格者解释道，将拳头塞进那件宽大的军大衣里。“我说过天空会是蓝色的，不是吗？这是一个使徒之子可以不戴呼吸面罩生活的地方。我们走吧，我想脱掉这身衣服。”

"The…" Shinji started, pushing his hands in her direction. The unease jumped at her throat in seconds; why the hell was the rage waning? "The cuffs?"  
这…" 真嗣开口道，双手向她伸去。不安感瞬间涌上她的喉咙；为什么怒火在消退？"手铐？

It had not gotten unnoticed by her that even with the jacket and cap on, Shinji still shivered from time to time, or how he had almost panicked when the VTOL's gate had opened. _He's gonna need antibiotics for the next two or three days,_ she recognized. The stupid cuffs felt unnaturally heavy inside her bag. "What for?" she pointed towards the nearest standing structure in their vicinity; a small wooden house standing just where a path meandered over to the village. "You can barely stand, what danger are you to anyone like this? Now move, brat. And give me back my cap, we've landed."  
她注意到，尽管穿着夹克戴着帽子，真嗣还是时不时地颤抖，以及他在 VTOL 舱门打开时几乎惊慌失措的样子，这些都没有逃过她的眼睛。她意识到，他接下来需要两三天的抗生素治疗。那副愚蠢的手铐在她包里感觉异常沉重。"为什么？"她指向附近的一座建筑物——一间小木屋，正好位于通往村庄的小径旁。"你连站都站不稳，这样能对谁构成威胁？快走，小子。把帽子还给我，我们已经着陆了。"

"Right…" she all but snatched it from his hold once he offered the black garment back and placed it on her head in a fluid motion. "Your… your jacket." Shinji was about to reach for the zipper when she slapped the hand away and positioned herself behind him, pushing him in the house's direction.  
"好……" 她几乎是从他手中夺过那件黑色外套，随即流畅地将其披在头上。"你的……你的夹克。" 真嗣正要伸手去拉拉链，却被她一巴掌拍开，然后她站到他身后，推着他朝屋子的方向走去。

"Keep the damn thing," came the cavernous growl. Without the hum of the WUNDER or the ominous noise of the VTOL's engines the trepidation and defeat in the boy's tone were overbearingly loud in her ears. "You probably sweated all over it, anyways. I don't want it anymore."  
留着那该死的东西吧，" 传来一阵低沉的咆哮。没有了 WUNDER 的嗡鸣声和 VTOL 引擎的不祥噪音，男孩语气中的恐惧与挫败在她耳中显得格外刺耳。"反正你大概已经把它弄得一身汗了。我再也不想要了。

They walked in silence, Asuka strode ahead and occasionally glared back at him to ensure he was still moving along. Luckily enough the house was a short distance away and in less than five minutes she was pushing the door open and shoving the idiot inside.  
他们默默地走着，明日香大步走在前面，偶尔回头瞪他一眼，确保他还在跟着。幸运的是，房子离得不远，不到五分钟，她已经推开门，把那个笨蛋推进了屋里。

"Ikari! Long time no see!"  
碇！好久不见！

Shinji blinked, and gaped at the tall, dark skinned man dressed in a doctor's coat before him. "T-Toji? You… You're _alive_?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼，目瞪口呆地看着面前这位身着医生白大褂、皮肤黝黑的男子。“阿-阿斯兰？你……你还活着？”

Toji's eyes softened almost immediately once he noticed the slight hollowness in Shinji's cheek, the rings under his eyes and the way he shook every now and then. Even so, for someone who had just seen a person he had thought was dead, the young man's eyes were strangely empty. "You don't remember, do you?" Still, he felt quite happy to see some actual shock and surprise shine in his old friend's features. "We actually met a few days ago, but I guess… yeah. It's okay."  
当看到真嗣脸颊略显消瘦、眼底的黑圈以及不时颤抖的样子，冬二的眼神立刻柔和了下来。即便如此，对于一个刚刚见到以为已故之人的人来说，这位年轻人的眼神却出奇地空洞。“你不记得了，对吧？”尽管如此，看到老友脸上闪现的震惊与惊讶，他还是感到相当高兴。“我们几天前其实见过面，但我想……嗯，没关系。”

"This all looks heartwarming and beautifully pathetic, but can we move this along?" Asuka snapped from where she stood, back pressed against the door and her eye fixed in the window. "Your brat friend has a fever and an infected cut on his left arm, near the wrist." She shrugged in forced nonchalance. "Can you get on that, Suzuhara?"  
“这一切看起来既温馨又凄美，但我们能快点进行吗？”明日香站在那里，背靠着门，眼睛紧盯着窗户，不耐烦地说道，“你那小鬼朋友发烧了，左腕附近还有个感染的伤口。”她故作轻松地耸了耸肩，“你能处理一下吗，铃原？”

In a reminiscent of their younger years, Toji gave her a deadpan glare and motioned for Shinji to sit on the wooden chair located next to his small desk. "Nice to see you too, Shikinami. Sure… whatever you say, Major. And may I inquire as to how he got that cut? He certainly didn't have it when he first arrived some days ago. Oh, no need to take off the jacket, Shinji. It's rather chilly today, so just roll up the sleeve and let me see."  
回想起他们年轻时的情景，冬二向她投去一个面无表情的瞪视，示意真嗣坐在他小桌子旁边的那把木椅上。“见到你也很高兴，式波。当然……随你怎么说，少校。不过我能否问一下，他那道伤口是怎么来的？他刚来这里几天前肯定还没有的。哦，真嗣，不用脱外套，今天挺冷的，把袖子卷起来让我看看就行了。”

Thinking of the wound made her nauseated, so the Second Child chose to turn away and shrug. "I'm not the brat's mother. How should I know how he got the stupid cut?" she replied, much harsher than intended. _I'm so angry at so many things at once that I can't even think straight._ "Just get it over with."  
想到那伤口让她感到恶心，于是二号适格者选择转过身耸了耸肩。“我又不是那小鬼的妈妈。我怎么知道他那愚蠢的伤口是怎么来的？”她回答得比原本打算的要严厉得多。我同时对那么多事情感到愤怒，以至于都无法清晰思考了。“快点处理完吧。”

"Aye, aye," the eldest Suzuhara busied himself with cutting the gauze and analyzing the jagged edges of the wound. Somebody had scrubbed every trace of pus away with brutal efficiency. "Well, it certainly looks like it _was_ quite a nasty infection, but seems to be healing well enough right now. I'll clean and redress it, maybe after another day or two there won't be any need to bandage it, anymore."  
“嗯，嗯，”最年长的铃原忙于剪裁纱布，分析伤口参差不齐的边缘。有人以近乎残忍的效率清除了所有脓液的痕迹。“好吧，看起来确实感染得很严重，但现在似乎愈合得不错。我会清理并重新包扎，也许再过一两天就不需要再包扎了。”

Asuka shrugged, stole a glance at the Third Child and upon noticing he was still gaping at the fact that Toji was alive, refocused her gaze on the window. "Here, some stuff." The heavy bag fell heavily on the floor next to the village physician. "Lots of that crap Ritsuko came up with."  
明日香耸了耸肩，偷瞄了一眼第三适格者，发现他还在惊讶于铃原活着的事实，便重新将目光转向窗外。“给，一些东西。”沉重的袋子重重地落在村医旁边。“很多那个叫律子的女人搞出来的玩意儿。”

Toji nodded without looking either at her or the bag. He prepared the necessary items to cleanse the wound and offered Shinji an apologetic glance. "This might sting a bit, Ikari."  
冬二没有看她或那个包，只是点了点头。他准备好清洗伤口所需的物品，向真嗣投去一个歉意的眼神。“这可能会有点疼，碇。”

_Damn,_ he mused, and set on the task as quickly and efficiently as possible. _He's really not fully there yet, is he? Damn, Ikari. I can't even begin to imagine…_ He noticed how slowly Shinji had nodded at him and how very little he was reacting to the pain. _This was festering horribly to give him this level of a fever. He's also thin, and paler than I remember._ "Something cut through the skin, metallic if I had to guess. What happened to his forehead?"  
该死，他暗自思忖，迅速而高效地开始了手头的任务。他真的还没完全恢复，是吧？该死的，碇。我简直无法想象……他注意到真嗣对他点头是多么缓慢，以及他对疼痛的反应是多么微弱。这伤口恶化得厉害，才会让他烧成这样。他还很瘦，比我记忆中更加苍白。“有什么东西划破了皮肤，我猜是金属的。他的额头是怎么回事？”

"The brat had a hissy fit and started banging his head against the floor," elucidated the female pilot in a clipped tone. "Nothing broken, no infection. I thought I said to hurry this up. I feel like I haven't had a proper shower in months."  
那小鬼发脾气了，开始用头撞地板，"女飞行员用干脆的语气解释道。"没骨折，也没感染。我记得我说过要快点。我感觉自己好像几个月没好好洗过澡了。

"Almost done." The cut was covered in thin gauze after he was satisfied with the overall state of it. "How are you feeling, Shinji? That welt sure looks like it hurts."  
快好了。"在他对伤口的整体状况满意后，用薄纱布覆盖了伤口。"你感觉怎么样，真嗣？那肿块看起来肯定很疼。

"I'm… fine. T-Toji," _Well, at least he's looking a bit livelier, now. That has to count for something._ The reality of seeing him turned into an adult when the last time they had seen each other they had all been Shinji's age was probably a very hard pill to swallow. "Is… I mean… your sister, and Hikari, a-and Kensuke. D-Did I-"  
“我……没事。东治，”嗯，至少他现在看起来精神些了，这总算是个好迹象。亲眼见到他变成成年人，而最后一次见面时大家都还和真嗣同龄，这现实想必难以接受。“是……我是说……你妹妹，还有光子，以及剑介。我……有……”

"All alive and accounted for, Shinji," he patted the boy's shoulder once the wound was properly redressed. "You look like you need a hot meal and some rest. Hey, Major." Pointing at one of the closet drawers as he gently tended to the surface of the cut on Shinji's forehead, Toji sighed. It was hard to see Shinji so… miserable. The look in his eyes reminded him of the redhead a bit too much. "There's a couple of those instant soups we retrieved the other day on the top right drawer. You know where the antibiotics are, so take enough for three days."  
都还活着，都算上了，真嗣。" 他轻轻拍了拍男孩的肩膀，待伤口妥善包扎后说道，"你看起来需要一顿热饭和好好休息。嘿，少校。" 他指着其中一个抽屉，同时轻柔地处理着真嗣额头上的伤口，东治叹了口气。看到真嗣如此……痛苦，让他感到很难受。那眼神让他不由得想起了那个红发女孩。"右上角的抽屉里有前几天我们找到的几包即食汤。你知道抗生素在哪里，所以拿够三天的量。

"Let the brat take his own god damned medicine. Do I look like a babysitter to you?" Asuka opened the door and stepped outside without another word. _Yeah, that's about the exact reaction I was expecting. You never disappoint, do you, Shikinami?_ With another sigh, the man rose from the chair and started rummaging through the drawers to extract the precious rations and hand them over to the Third Child.  
"让那小子自己吃他的该死的药。我看起来像保姆吗？" 明日香打开门，一言不发地走了出去。是啊，这正是我预料中的反应。你从未让人失望，不是吗，式波？男人再次叹息，从椅子上站起来，开始翻找抽屉，取出珍贵的口粮递给第三适格者。

It did not go unnoticed by him just whose jacket Shinji was wearing. "Here, Ikari. Take one of these twice a day and you'll be back on your feet in no time. Don't worry about anything but getting better right now, there'll be time to talk soon enough."  
他并未忽视真嗣身上穿的是谁的外套。“来，碇。这些药每天吃两次，很快就能恢复的。现在别担心别的，专心养好身体，不久我们就有时间好好聊聊了。”

Shinji nodded faintly, moving the jacket's hem just enough to let Toji catch a glimpse of the DSS collar hiding underneath. He frowned in distaste, pressed the small packages against the young man's chest. "Make sure to mix these with hot water. Might not taste too well, but it'll replenish you." This time around, the former jock placed both hands on his old friend's shoulders and squeezed as reassuringly as he knew how. "You're not doing so well, are you?"  
真嗣微微点头，轻轻拉了拉外套的下摆，让冬二瞥见了隐藏在下面的 DSS 项圈。他皱起眉头，露出厌恶的表情，将小包药片按在年轻人的胸前。“记得用热水混合服用。可能味道不太好，但能让你恢复体力。”这一次，这位曾经的运动员双手搭在老朋友的肩上，尽可能地给予安慰。“你看起来状态不太好，是吧？”

"I… don't think so," Shinji chose to stare at ground, feeling the relief of knowing his friends of all had somehow survived. He recalled… light blue hair and red eyes, an absolute lack of recognition, a stranger wearing a familiar face. "Uhm… do you… know where Rei is, Toji?"  
“我……不这么认为，”真嗣选择盯着地面，感受到一种庆幸，知道所有的朋友都奇迹般地幸存了下来。他回想起……淡蓝色的头发和红色的眼睛，完全没有认出他来的迹象，一个戴着熟悉面孔的陌生人。“呃……你知道丽在哪里吗，阿薰？”

"Huh?" it took a few seconds for the doctor to relate the name to a face. "Oh, the girl from the Ayanami Series, right." The mysterious girl had been placed under Hikari's care some days before; as far as he could see she was everything but a blank canvas, certainly more than some poor human made to obey. "She's been staying with us for some days, now. She's fine, you can check on her tomorrow if you want. Now," _I'd really like to just give you a hug, Shinji, and tell you everything's going to be okay._ "Let's not make the Major wait, hmm? She might tear both our heads off if we do."  
“啊？”医生花了好几秒钟才将这个名字与一张脸联系起来。“哦，你是说那个‘绫波系列’的女孩，对吧。”那个神秘的女孩几天前被托付给光照顾；就他所见，她绝非一张白纸，肯定不仅仅是一个被迫服从的可怜人。“她已经和我们住了几天了，现在。她很好，如果你想的话，明天可以去看她。现在，”我真的很想给你一个拥抱，真嗣，告诉你一切都会好起来的。“我们别让少校等太久，好吗？否则她可能会把我们俩的头都拧下来。”

"Asuka…" Shinji muttered as he rose to his feet, eyes glued to the man's worn out shoes. A sudden weight lifted off his shoulders when he heard the stranger wearing Rei's face was still alive, yet the moment lasted close to nothing when he recalled the redhead's glare. "She hates me, doesn't she?"  
明日香……" 真嗣喃喃自语，站起身来，目光紧盯着那人磨损的鞋子。得知那个长着绫波脸的陌生人还活着，他突然感到肩上的重担减轻了，但这一刻转瞬即逝，当他回想起红发少女的瞪视时，"她讨厌我，对吧？

_Jeez, man. She's standing outside this door, you know,_ pondered the former athlete with a small smile. "I don't think so, no." He chose to answer with honesty, and felt strangely compelled to take Shinji to his home instead of letting him go with Asuka. There was so much he wanted to say to him, so much he wished to hear from him, and yet he had very little time, and almost no chance to do so. There was no time for little white lies. Toji's hand grasped the door handle. "She was the one who cleaned that cut, wasn't she? Give it some time, Shinji. Get yourself better, and then maybe try to talk to her about it."  
天啊，老兄。她就在这门外站着呢，前运动员带着一丝微笑思索着。"我不这么认为，没有。"他选择诚实地回答，并感到一种奇怪的冲动，想带真嗣回家而不是让他和明日香走。他有很多话想对他说，很多话想听他说，然而时间紧迫，几乎没有任何机会。没有时间说些无关痛痒的谎言。冬二的手握住了门把手。"是她帮你清理了伤口，对吧？给点时间，真嗣。先让自己好起来，然后再试着和她谈谈。"

_Right, talk to her…_ Speaking at all was difficult; he wanted nothing more than to never speak or be heard from again, he wanted to disappear and be forgotten. Alas, he had a penance to complete, so Shinji nodded and made his way to the door. He almost laughed at the very idea of speaking to the Major in hopes of clearing the air between them. It would most certainly be easier to make the sky blue again than to speak to Asuka. "Thank you… for… thank you, Toji."  
好吧，去和她谈谈……开口说话本就艰难；他只希望能永远不再言语，不再被人记起，消失于世，被人遗忘。然而，他还有赎罪之路要走，于是真嗣点点头，向门口走去。他几乎要嘲笑自己竟想通过与少校交谈来缓和彼此间的紧张气氛。这简直比让天空再次变蓝还要困难，去和明日香说话。“谢谢你……为了……谢谢你，剑介。”

"Don't worry about it," Just as he walked out the door, Toji noticed something shine on Shinji's neck as the sun's fading sunlight clashed against it. _Heh, look at that._ A few of Asuka's crimson tresses were trapped on the boy's skin, just around his nape and shoulders. "Remember to eat and replenish your strength, Shinji. I'll see you tomorrow, okay?"  
“别放在心上，”正当他走出门口时，剑介注意到夕阳的余晖在真嗣的脖颈上闪烁。嘿，看那儿。几缕明日香鲜红的秀发缠绕在少年的颈后和肩上。“记得吃饭，补充体力，真嗣。明天见，好吗？”

"Uhm… sure. Thank you." Unsure of what else to say or do, Shinji bowed. Whatever emotion was dancing in the elder Suzuhara's eyes made his chest hurt, so he opted to just stare at the ground and wonder why, exactly, he was being allowed to walk unbound and unchained, or why Asuka had bothered to bring him to the man's… whatever the house was and have the wound cleaned and redressed. _I don't think I even remember… how I got that cut in the first place._ "Please say hi to Hokari-san for me."  
嗯…好的。谢谢。" 不知该说什么或做什么，真嗣鞠了一躬。铃原前辈眼中闪烁的情感让他胸口隐隐作痛，于是他选择盯着地面，疑惑为何自己能不受束缚地行走，为何明日香会费心带他来到这人的…无论这是什么房子，还让他清洗并重新包扎伤口。我甚至不记得…那道伤口是怎么来的。"请代我向光莉小姐问好。

"I will, don't worry. Remember, Shinji; one pill twice a day and plenty of water. Try not to get the bandages wet, either. Oh, and try to add a little salt to those instant so-"  
我会转达的，别担心。记住，真嗣；一天两次，每次一片，多喝水。也尽量不要弄湿绷带。哦，还有，试着在那些速食食品里加点盐——

"Save the chitter chatter for another day, Suzuhara," Asuka cut in all of the sudden, took a firm hold of Shinji's right wrist and began to drag him away before heh could say goodbye to the Third Child. "KenKen home?" she demanded more than asked as she walked away.  
"留着闲聊改天吧，铃原，" 明日香突然插话，紧紧抓住真嗣的右手腕，拉着他离开，不给他向第三适格者告别的机会。"健健回家吗？" 她边走边问，语气更像是在命令。

"Nah, he's out in the city collecting some materials he needed for… ah, right." Touji shook his head and chuckled; the girl was already out of earshot by the time he tried to answer her inquiry. Somehow, the sight of both EVA pilots brought a strange sense of peace to his heart; in a world filled with ruin and struggle, it felt good to hope again. "There it goes, the married couple… heh."  
不，他去城里收集一些他需要的材料……啊，对了。" 东治摇摇头笑了笑；当他试图回答她的询问时，女孩已经走远了。不知为何，看到两位 EVA 驾驶员在一起，他的心中涌起一种奇异的平静感；在这个充满废墟和挣扎的世界里，再次怀抱希望的感觉真好。"看吧，那对小夫妻……嘿。

"_She hates me, doesn't she?"_  
她讨厌我，对吧？

"Nah," he said to the fading sun and to Shinji's retreated back, watching them walk away until they disappeared behind a small hill. "I think it might actually be the other way around, Ikari."  
才不呢，"他对着渐渐西沉的太阳和真嗣远去的背影说道，目送他们直到消失在小山丘后。"我觉得可能恰恰相反，碇。

"Finally," she pushed the door open, minding to take a look at the Entry Plug sitting outside the small house before she dragged Shinji inside and breathed a sigh of actual relief. "You'll sleep over there," Asuka pointed at a spot near the small table in the house's living room. "I need a shower. There's water near the sink, blue bottles are the ones you can drink."  
“终于，”她推开门，留意到小屋外停放的插入栓，然后将真嗣拽进屋内，真正松了一口气。“你睡那边，”明日香指着屋内客厅靠近小桌的地方说，“我要去洗个澡。水槽附近有水，蓝色瓶子的是可以喝的。”

The house was not particularly large, but it was comfortable enough and it was the closest thing to a home she knew aside from the Entry Plug itself; boxes filled with pieces of machinery and objects Kensuke had collected over the years decorated the walls and corners. The weight hanging from her shoulder reminded Asuka of two elements in the backpack she no longer cared to carry; she opened the zipper and pushed the dictionary on Shinji's chest. _Stupid brat was just standing there anyways, let him do something productive for once._  
这房子并不特别大，但足够舒适，对她来说，除了插入栓本身，这是她所知的最近的家的感觉；墙上和角落装饰着由多年收集的机械零件和物品组成的盒子，这些都是健介收集的。肩上的重量提醒明日香背包里有两个她不再关心的元素；她拉开拉链，将字典推到真嗣胸前。反正这笨蛋就站在那里，让他做点有意义的事吧。

The boy's hands gripped onto the heavy book in a reaction quicker than any she had seen since he had moved to keep the cap in place earlier that day. His motor functions seemed to also be returning little by little. "Uhm… thank you, Asuka." Hearing those words from him made her frown deepen; even after letting him rot for days, he was showing gratitude for a meaningless book and some spare batteries. "I… Touji said to…" he produced the small packages from his pant pocket. "Is there… a kitchen?"  
男孩的手紧紧抓住那本沉重的书，反应之快是她自那天他挪动身体保持帽子不掉以来所未见的。他的运动功能似乎也在一点点恢复。“呃……谢谢你，明日香。”听到他说出这些话，她的眉头皱得更深了；即使让他自生自灭了这么多天，他竟然还对一本无足轻重的书和几节备用电池表示感激。“我……东治说……”他从裤袋里掏出小包裹。“这里……有厨房吗？”

"Gas stove on our left, single burner. There's not a lot of gas, try not to burn the house down." She turned her back and walked over to one of two available rooms in the house to collect some much needed clothes and lock herself in the bathroom. For once in so many years, she felt uncomfortable inside the small house. "Do whatever, just nothing stupid. _Brat_."  
“煤气灶在我们左边，单灶头。煤气不多了，别把房子烧了。”她转身走向屋内仅有的两个房间之一，去拿一些急需的衣服，然后把自己锁在浴室里。这么多年来，她第一次在这间小屋里感到不自在。“随便做什么，只要别做蠢事。小鬼。”

The slam of the restroom door brought Shinji back to reality; he was still standing there, holding the white package in his hand, barely breathing. _Gas stove… on my left._ He set about boiling some of the water in a pan he found next to the stove after placing the book on the table. A tremor shook his body, much less extreme than the ones he had been having earlier, yet he still almost dropped the pan. The house looked nice enough, albeit a bit too full of boxes and what he assumed were pieces of electronics strewn about. _Pour the package into the boiling water… salt. Touji said to add salt._  
洗手间门的猛然关闭将真嗣拉回了现实；他依旧站在那里，手中紧握着白色包裹，几乎屏住了呼吸。煤气灶……在我左边。他将书放在桌上后，开始在灶旁找到的平底锅中烧水。一阵颤抖穿过他的身体，虽远不及之前那般剧烈，但他仍差点失手滑落平底锅。房子看起来颇为温馨，尽管四处堆满了箱子和散落的电子零件。将包裹倒入沸水中……盐。东治说要加盐。

He hesitated to look for anything in the house; if he moved something or placed it in an improper place the female pilot was sure to let him know about it. Regardless of the heavy burden of having to somehow mend the mistakes which had caused her so much pain, he was starting to feel incredibly uncomfortable in her presence, so he opted not to look for salt and simply limit himself to mixing the strange powder once the water began to boil.  
他犹豫着不敢在屋里找任何东西；一旦他移动了某样物品或将其放错位置，女飞行员肯定会指出来。尽管肩负着必须设法弥补那些给她带来如此多痛苦的错误的沉重负担，他在她面前开始感到极度不适，因此他选择不去找盐，只是在水开始沸腾时简单地将那奇怪的粉末搅拌进去。

Slowly but surely, as he used a wooden spoon to ensure whatever concoction he was preparing did not go up in flames, Shinji relaxed. It was the first time in too long that he simply cooked; there was no piloting, no EVAs, no Apocalypse, there was no Father glaring down at him like he was a tool or an insect, there was no Misato willing to blow his head off. Even Asuka's permanent glare faded off his tired mind for a few precious seconds. After finding two bowls sitting to his right and realizing there was a faint, spicy smell coming off the pan Shinji's stomach grumbled. He was starting to feel hunger and thirst more acutely than before.  
慢慢地，但确实地，当他用木勺确保正在调制的任何混合物不会烧焦时，真嗣放松了下来。他已经太久没有单纯地做饭了；没有驾驶，没有 EVA，没有末日，没有父亲像看待工具或虫子一样瞪着他，没有美里随时准备爆他的头。就连明日香那永久的怒视也在他疲惫的脑海中短暂消散了几秒。发现右手边有两个碗，并意识到平底锅散发出淡淡的辛辣气味后，真嗣的肚子咕噜作响。他开始比以前更敏锐地感受到饥饿和口渴。

The… soup tasted of nothing he could identify, just an almost imperceptible aftertaste of ginger and what felt like an imitation of chicken stew, yet he still gulped it down along with the antibiotic when Asuka's words rang loud in his brain. He was supposed to eat and take care of himself, supposed to survive and pay his penance, whatever it meant. Making sure to pour a more generous portion in the second bowl and covering it with a small plate after laying it on the table, Shinji all but collapsed. The jacket kept him warm after he practically fell on a small futon placed on the floor; it drove away the shakes as night descended and the air became colder. He opened the dictionary to find the next word, rewound the SDAT and tried to focus on the words printed in the page.  
那汤的味道他辨认不出，只有一丝几乎察觉不到的姜味和一种类似鸡肉炖菜的仿制感，但他还是和着抗生素一饮而尽，因为明日香的话在他脑海中回响。他应该吃东西，照顾好自己，应该活下去并赎罪，无论那意味着什么。确保在第二碗里多倒了一些，并用小盘子盖好后放在桌上，真嗣几乎瘫倒。外套让他感到温暖，当他实际上倒在地板上的小被褥上时；它驱散了夜晚降临和空气变冷时的颤抖。他打开词典查找下一个单词，倒带 SDAT 并试图专注于页面上印着的文字。

'_Inaction. In·ac·tion: 1. Failure to do anything that might provide a solution to a problem. 2. Lack of action when some is expected or appropriate. 3. Lack of action or activity.'_  
'不作为。不·作·为：1. 未能采取任何可能解决问题的行动。2. 在预期或适当的情况下缺乏行动。3. 缺乏行动或活动。'

"Inaction," he whispered to the empty living room, head lolling to the side. "Failure to do anything that might… _sigh_… provide a solution to a problem…" His lids closed a few moments afterwards as fatigue won over. Shinji fell to his side, clutching the book close to his chest and was awarded a second dreamless slumber.  
"无所作为，"他对着空荡荡的客厅低语，头歪向一边。"未能采取任何可能……唉……解决问题的行动……" 疲惫最终战胜了他，几分钟后眼皮便合上了。真嗣侧身躺下，将书紧紧抱在胸前，再次陷入无梦的沉睡。

Asuka found him lying on the futon and breathing deep and levelly. She spent as much time as possible in the bathroom and after dressing into a shirt, shorts and the military coat she had collected, she took the bowl resting on the table and emptied in a few gulps.  
明日香发现他躺在蒲团上，呼吸深沉而平稳。她在浴室里尽可能地拖延时间，然后穿上衬衫、短裤和收集来的军装外套，拿起桌上的碗，几口便喝了个干净。

"Bah," she grumbled, glaring down at the empty pan and the white package lying next to it. "It's all water in the end."  
“哼，”她咕哝着，怒视着空荡荡的平底锅和旁边那包白色物品。“到头来不过是些水罢了。”

Intent on playing with her console until either the sun rose or tiredness dragged her to a restless slumber, the redhead almost walked by the small note and box lying by the table. Kensuke's quick handwriting had her squinting at the kanji.  
她一心想着玩她的游戏机，直到太阳升起或疲惫将她拖入不安的睡眠，以至于差点儿错过了桌旁的小纸条和盒子。健介那潦草的字迹让她眯起眼睛辨认着汉字。

'_Hey, Shikinami! Sorry I couldn't be here, had to go find some pieces for the water pumps that broke a week ago. Found something before I ran into you some days ago, you might want to take a look! Take care. Kensuke.'_  
'嘿，式波！抱歉没能在这儿等你，我得去找些水泵上周坏掉的零件。几天前遇到你之前找到了点东西，你可能会想看看！保重。健介。'

The box contained an old, damaged cellphone with a broken screen where apparently a single file was stored. _Sure, whatever. Let's see what can be so exciting about a stupid video._ She took a seat on one of two available chairs, crossed her legs and pressed play on the device; the mere contact of her finger had the entire thing squeaking in protest. _This thing is about to freaking disintegrate in my palm. What the hell was he think-_  
盒子里装着一个老旧、损坏的手机，屏幕碎了，显然只存了一个文件。好吧，管它呢。看看这愚蠢的视频能有什么好激动的。她在一把椅子上坐下，翘起腿，按下了播放键；仅仅是指尖的触碰就让整个设备吱吱作响，抗议起来。这玩意儿快要在我手里散架了。他到底在想什么——

"_If it wasn't for Commander Ikari's decision, you could've been killed!"_  
“如果不是碇司令的决定，你可能已经死了！”

The desperation and fear in Maya's voice brought her attention to the feed; Asuka's eye widened. The video was badly filmed and continued to move as though whoever had recorded it was running or moving constantly, yet the figure of Unit 01 standing on top of the Geofront was unmistakable.  
真嗣的声音中透露出的绝望与恐惧引起了她的注意；明日香睁大了眼睛。视频拍摄得很糟糕，画面持续晃动，仿佛拍摄者一直在奔跑或移动，但初号机站在地底都市上的身影却清晰可辨。

"_That has nothing to do with it!"_ Shinji's voice was also unmistakable even badly amplified through the cracked and beaten speaker. _What… what am I watching, right now?_  
"那与此无关！" 即使通过破损的扬声器严重失真，真嗣的声音依然无可置疑。我……我现在到底在看什么？

"_But it's the truth!"_ The Evangelion stomped on the pyramid's tip and even the ground under whoever was recording the video shook.  
"但这是事实！" 福音战士重重踩在金字塔顶端，连同拍摄者脚下的地面都为之震动。

"_Didn't I say that has nothing to do with it!?"_ It was by far the most furious she had ever heard Shinji's voice become; she had honestly believed it was impossible for him to be so incensed. _"My father… he tried to kill Asuka… with my own hands!"_  
“我不是说过那与此无关吗！？”这是她迄今为止听过的真嗣最愤怒的声音；她真的以为他不可能如此激愤。“我父亲……他试图用我的双手杀死明日香！”

"What…" she said out loud. The video was stopped and she stole a furtive glance at the still sleeping form of the Third Child. Her legs carried her over to the leftmost corner of the house, where the noise of the video was as far from him as possible.  
"什么…" 她大声说道。视频暂停了，她偷偷瞥了一眼仍在熟睡的第三适格者。她的双腿不由自主地带着她走向房子最左边的角落，那里视频的声音离他最远。

Unit 01 stepped on the Geofront again, and again, and again. _"Why?! WHY?! Why, damn it!? You don't understand_ _**anything**__, Father! I was a fool to believe in you!"_ It felt as though Shinji was absolutely willing and determined to… destroy the pyramid under his feet. "_You should just go and lose someone important to you too, father! Then you'll understand!"_  
初号机一次又一次地踏在 Geofront 上。"为什么？！为什么？！该死的，为什么？！你什么都不懂，父亲！我真是个傻瓜，竟然相信你！" 仿佛真嗣完全愿意并且决心要…摧毁他脚下的金字塔。"你也应该去失去一个对你重要的人，父亲！那样你就会明白了！"

The image was suddenly blurred and the video ended just as abruptly as it began. _What did he… what did he just say?_ She watched and listened intently to every word a second time, unconsciously walking closer to where the boy slept. _Someone important to you…_  
画面突然变得模糊，视频也如开始时那般突兀地结束了。他刚才说了什么？她全神贯注地再次观看并聆听每一个字，不知不觉间走近了男孩睡觉的地方。对你来说很重要的人……

For the first time ever since Unit 01's sudden awakening, Asuka's eye gazed upon Shinji devoid of any anger or resentment. He was still holding onto the dictionary and shivered every few minutes; she picked the blanket resting in the bedroom she normally slept in and covered him with it before the actions registered in her brain. Why did it matter to her at all if he was cold or not, after all?  
自从初号机突然觉醒以来，这是第一次，明日香看着真嗣的眼神中没有了愤怒或怨恨。他依然紧握着那本词典，每隔几分钟就颤抖一下；她从自己通常睡觉的卧室里拿起一条毯子，盖在他身上，然后这些举动才在她的脑海中留下印象。毕竟，他冷不冷对她来说又有什么关系呢？

"_You should just go and lose someone important to you, too!"_ The WonderSwan lay on the table, forgotten for the time being as it rested next to her cap. The blue of the smaller roundel glistened under the faint light of the screen.  
"你也该去失去一个对你重要的人！" 神奇天鹅游戏机躺在桌上，暂时被遗忘，静静地躺在她的帽子旁。小圆盘上的蓝色在屏幕微弱的光线下闪烁着光泽。

Unbearable pain around his midsection and leg forced his eyes open; this was the second time he had expected never to wake back up, however, the pain refused to disappear and leave him be. Perhaps the Plug Suit's life support system and compression were the only reason he had not yet bled to death or died of shock, perhaps the experiences in piloting had forced his pain threshold to not even allow him to get into shock anymore.  
腹部与腿部的剧痛迫使他睁开双眼；这是他第二次以为自己再也不会醒来，然而，疼痛却执意不散，不肯让他安宁。或许，正是驾驶服的生命维持系统和压力支撑，才让他未因失血过多或休克而死；或许，驾驶中的经历已将他的痛阈提升至不再允许他陷入休克的地步。

The sky swam in and out of focus, every time the agony of his wounds forced his eyes open, he saw less and less blue as dark spots manifested in his vision. Even the breathtaking firmament was getting dark and blotted. How long had passed ever since the Entry Plug crashed on the building? Strange, that his decision to push Rei to the bottom of the cylindrical structure would keep her safe from harm. The long hair looked good on her, hopefully none of it had gotten stained with his blood.  
天空时而清晰时而模糊，每当伤口的剧痛迫使他睁眼，视野中的蓝色便越来越少，取而代之的是一片片暗斑。就连那令人窒息的苍穹也逐渐暗淡，被阴影吞噬。自插入栓坠入大楼以来，究竟过去了多久？奇怪的是，他决定将绫波推至圆柱形结构的底部，这一决定竟让她免受伤害。她那一头长发显得格外美丽，希望没有一丝一毫被他的血迹玷污。

_Where… could she be…?_ Shinji wondered and coughed, letting his head lull to the left. There was a fleeting memory of Rei hurrying somewhere after saying some words to him that sounded more a low hum than anything else. Shinji coughed and wheezed, his right hand came to instinctively rest around the rod protruding out of his midsection in a futile attempt to stop the bleeding. What was the point? He had his permission, did he not?  
她在哪儿…？真嗣思索着，咳嗽起来，头无力地偏向左侧。脑海中闪过零号机匆匆离去的身影，她对他说了些什么，声音低沉模糊，更像是喃喃自语。真嗣咳喘着，右手本能地按在从腹部穿出的杆子上，试图止住血流，但这又有什么意义呢？他不是已经得到许可了吗？

_So, do I now climb into the EVA and fight?_ He asked himself, recalling the last conversation he'd had with anyone who was not Asuka, Rei, Kaworu or his father_. No. Yes. It's up to you, in the end._ The voice responded with a low, calm undertone. _But, I've been… I've been trying to find a way to help… to fight… for weeks._ A smile, a sad, knowing smile was thrown his way; back then the scenery had been green and blue and brown and beautiful, a infantisimal piece of paradise in the midst of hell. _Of course you have, you feel guilt. You want redemption._ Even so close to death, he still recalled how his knees had dug deeper into his chest as he sat there, by the lake with the stranger. _I want to mend my mistakes._ He remembered saying, almost in a whisper. Eyes filled with pain, suffering and understanding, a hand on his shoulder, a knowing smile yet again. _The mistakes you have suffered for._  
那么，我现在要穿上 EVA 去战斗吗？他自问，回想起与非明日香、绫波、渚薰或父亲之外的任何人进行的最后一次对话。不。是的。最终还是取决于你。一个低沉平静的嗓音回应道。但是，我已经……我已经努力寻找帮助……战斗的方法……已经好几个星期了。那时，他得到了一个悲伤而理解的微笑；那时的景色是绿、蓝、棕交织的美丽，宛如地狱中的一小块天堂。当然，你感到内疚。你渴望救赎。即便濒临死亡，他仍记得当时坐在湖边与陌生人一起时，双膝紧紧抵住胸口的情景。我想弥补我的过失。他记得自己几乎耳语般地说道。眼中充满痛苦、苦难与理解，一只手搭在肩上，再次露出理解的微笑。那些你为之受苦的错误。

Without having the SDAT to hold, the fingers of his left hand shook and accidentally grazed against the pin stuck to his leg. However exhausted and near death he was, Shinji forced his aching fingers to work properly for what it felt like the last time and retrieved the object, holding on to it with every bit of his fading strength. The devil insignia was pressed against him, he held it close to his chest and smiled in between coughs and wheezes; the red, white and black decorating the object glistened ever so slightly against the filtering sunlight. He held it between the shaking fingers for a few heartbeats, trying to focus his fading vision in the cute pirate skull looking back at him.  
没有了 SDAT 在手，他左手的手指颤抖着，不小心碰到了插在腿上的别针。尽管疲惫至极，濒临死亡，真嗣还是强迫自己疼痛的手指正常工作，仿佛这是最后一次，他用尽最后一丝力气取出了那个物品，紧紧握住。恶魔徽章紧贴着他，他将其紧贴胸口，在咳嗽和喘息间露出微笑；徽章上的红、白、黑在透过阳光下微微闪烁。他用颤抖的手指夹住徽章，试图在可爱的海盗骷髅图案中聚焦自己逐渐模糊的视线。

Afraid his hands would drop the trinket as they had dropped the SDAT, he clutched the insignia and pressed it where his heart was still faintly beating, adamant on not parting from it at any point. Blood continued to trickle down, time passed, his breathing became slow and labored, and still he held onto the pin like his fading life depended on it. He had promised to bring it back, after all; whatever the cost, he'd deliver the trinket to its rightful owner.  
担心双手会像丢掉 SDAT 一样失手掉落这个小饰品，他紧紧抓住徽章，将其按在心脏仍在微弱跳动的地方，坚决不与它分离。鲜血继续流淌，时间流逝，他的呼吸变得缓慢而费力，但他依然紧紧抓着别针，仿佛他逐渐消逝的生命全靠它维系。毕竟，他曾承诺过要把它带回来；无论代价如何，他都要将这个小饰品归还给真正的主人。

Even when giving the roundel back produced a deep sense of agony in his battered chest, he was glad to have carried it for as long as he had. It almost felt like… a part of her, one he would much rather never again do without. A strangled sob mixed with a cough forced his entire body to contort in absolute agony, so he focused all of his attention not on the blue sky, but on the small devil held in his palm. Did he really have to give it back? It would be nice to keep it, if only for a while more, maybe he could hold on to it until his life finished dripping away. The insignia had provided solace and been the source of bravery and determination not too long ago. Had it been a gift? A keepsake? An amulet? _It's cute…_ he pondered tiredly. His chest was light, for once; having said his peace and his truths to those he cared about, Shinji felt as ready as he would ever be to leave the world he had desperately tried to save.  
即便归还那枚圆形徽章在他伤痕累累的胸中激起深切的痛楚，他仍庆幸自己曾长久地持有它。那几乎让他感觉像是……她的一部分，一个他宁愿永远不再失去的部分。一声哽咽混杂着咳嗽迫使他整个身体因极度痛苦而扭曲，于是他将所有注意力集中在掌中的小恶魔上，而非蓝天。他真的必须归还它吗？如果能再保留片刻，该有多好，或许他可以一直握着它，直到生命悄然流逝殆尽。不久前，这徽章还曾是慰藉之源，赋予他勇气与决心。它是礼物吗？纪念品？护身符？真可爱……他疲惫地思索着。他的胸口难得轻盈；向他在乎的人倾诉了心声与真相后，真嗣感到自己已准备好，如同终将离去般，离开这个他曾竭力拯救的世界。

Breathing was becoming too painful and his leg felt like it was on fire, imaginably if he stopped moving altogether the agony would dissipate at last. Twice already he had fallen asleep, twice had the pain ripped him from the well-earned rest which awaited in oblivion. With the last of his fading consciousness, Shinji wished that whatever he had managed to do had worked in some positive way; he had seen a blue sky after falling, the sun rising, the air fresh and devoid of the stench of blood. _What do you want, Shinji?_ Asked the stranger in his memory. His hold on the roundel tightened.  
呼吸变得愈发痛苦，他的腿仿佛在烈焰中燃烧，可以想象，如果他完全停止移动，那折磨终将消散。他已经两次陷入沉睡，又两次被疼痛从这应得的安宁中撕扯出来，这安宁本该在遗忘中等待着他。在意识即将消逝之际，真嗣祈祷着他所做的一切能在某种程度上带来积极的结果；他坠落后看到了蓝天，太阳升起，空气清新，没有了血腥的恶臭。“真嗣，你想要什么？”记忆中的陌生人问道。他紧握着圆盘的手更用力了。

_I think I just want to… live. With… with Asuka, if that were ever possible, if she'd… let me. I want her to… forgive me. I want to make it up to her for not… for not being there. I want to read, and cook and... It's stupid._ The same quiet, knowing smile shone bright in his memory. An invisible hand squeezed his uninjured shoulder. _Doesn't sound stupid to me, sounds like a fine goal. if you keep trying, then… maybe you'll have it. These limes are pretty good, wouldn't you say so? Do you know what I dream of, at times? What keeps me going through this Hell? Heh, it's kind of dumb. Sometimes I simply wish for… heh…_  
我想我只是想……活着。和……和明日香一起，如果那有可能的话，如果她……愿意让我。我希望她能……原谅我。我想弥补我没有……没有在她身边的过错。我想读书、烹饪和……这很愚蠢。他记忆中那抹平静而深谙的微笑依然明亮。一只无形的手轻捏着他未受伤的肩膀。对我来说并不愚蠢，听起来是个美好的目标。如果你坚持努力，那么……也许你会拥有它。这些青柠很不错，你不觉得吗？你知道我有时梦想什么吗？是什么让我在这地狱中坚持下去？呵呵，有点傻。有时我只是希望……呵呵……

"A world where everyone…" he wheezed as his thumb caressed the skull's eye-patch with fondness. "Can enjoy… a nice, cold glass of… lemonade…" A world where Asuka could taste the food of a Bento again, a world where Misato smiled. If he had achieved even that one, simple thing… then it had all been worth it.  
“一个世界，每个人……”他喘息着，拇指深情地抚摸着骷髅眼罩。“都能享受……一杯冰凉的……柠檬水……”一个世界，明日香能再次品尝便当的美味，一个世界，美里能展露笑容。如果他能实现那一件简单的事……那么这一切都值得了。

He heard voices from afar, screams and commands; the sound of an explosion faintly rang in his ears. For the time being, he had stopped coughing up blood with every breath, yet every movement meant having the metal rod cruelly bite into his guts. Just as the nonexistent hand from his memory drew away a very real, warm and strong one curled against his shoulder. His fading hearing registered a faint gasp, he saw a flash of red in between the dark spots of his vision, and everything went quiet.  
他听到远处传来的声音，尖叫与命令交织；爆炸的声响隐约在耳边回荡。暂时地，他不再每呼吸一次就咳出血来，但每一次移动都意味着那根金属棒无情地刺入他的内脏。正如记忆中那只不存在的手，轻轻移开了一只真实、温暖而有力的手，那只手正紧贴着他的肩膀。他逐渐模糊的听觉捕捉到一声微弱的喘息，视线中的暗斑间闪过一抹红色，随后一切归于寂静。

The roundel never fell from his grasp; he focused every last bit of his being into holding onto the small trinket against his chest. Someone was yelling far, far away. He had achieved some level of peace, at long last, and for once ever since crash landing on the building, the pain subsided and faded away.  
那枚圆形徽章始终未曾从他手中滑落；他用尽最后一丝力气，紧紧抓住贴在胸前的小饰物。有人在遥远的地方呼喊。他终于获得了某种程度的平静，自坠机降落在这座建筑以来，痛苦首次减轻并逐渐消退。

_AN: Yo! Hah! I felt really bad about this poor story to be honest, abandoned and isolated for seven fucking years, so I felt obliged to put up at least one more chappie of it before the release of 4.0. I'd love to promise yall I'll keep the chappies short, sort of 14k words and such, but the words ring hollow in my ears. As is usual, each chapter will probably be longer than the former until we reach the typical, episodic 40k words chapters.  
作者的话：哟！哈哈！老实说，我对这篇可怜的故事感到非常抱歉，它被遗弃和孤立了整整七年，所以我感到有必要在 4.0 发布前至少再更新一章。我很想向大家承诺我会保持章节简短，大约 1.4 万字左右，但这些话在我耳中显得空洞。一如既往，每个《一千零一夜》章节可能会比前一个更长，直到我们达到典型的每章 4 万字篇幅。_

_Is Shinji ded? Gimme a sec, lemme ask (Turns back) "Yo! Is you ded?!"  
真嗣死了吗？等一下，我问问（转身）“喂！你死了吗？！”_

_Shin-chan coughs up blood. "Not… yet…"  
小新咳出血来。“还…没…”_

_(Shrugs) Well, there ya go. Not yet.  
（耸肩）好吧，就是这样。还没呢。_

_I'm liking the way this story is going so far so I'll probably be coming back to it for more updates as time passes. Other projects such as the Epilogue for Scar Tissue and the next episode of Relapse might take more importance. Honestly, though, writing this story comes quite naturally and almost feels like a break from my other stuff so yeah. I'll try to regularly update, somehow.  
目前故事的发展让我很喜欢，所以随着时间的推移，我可能会回来继续更新。其他项目，比如《伤痕》的尾声和《复发》的下一集，可能会更重要。不过说实话，写这个故事对我来说很自然，几乎感觉像是从其他工作中抽身出来休息一样。所以，我会尽量定期更新，无论如何。_

_Special thanks and shoutout to my mofockers from the_ _**AsuShin Trash Discord**_ _channel for helping me so much and keeping my ass inspired to write! Love yall!_  
特别感谢并大声呼唤来自 AsuShin Trash Discord 频道的我的小伙伴们，你们帮了我很多，也让我保持写作的灵感！爱你们！

### Chapter 4 Survival  

_AN: I'm back, bitches! Hah! Here's another chappie!  
AN: 我又回来了，混蛋们！哈！再来一章！_

There was no need for sleep, nor did any desire for food or drink assault her. The being inhabiting her eye provided more than enough energy and sustenance for her to part from elemental human needs; she ate and drank out of habit, in an effort to convince herself that there was, indeed, a little piece of humanity left inside. At times, she dozed off as well, lulled to a dreamless slumber that left her feeling unchanged; she was always tired, always angry, always feeling terrible. The sickness running through her made her more of a monster than Shinji's actions made him one. She had meant those words in the prison cell, every one of them.  
无需睡眠，亦无饮食之欲侵扰她。寄居于她眼中的存在赋予了她超越凡人需求的充沛能量与滋养；她进食饮水，不过出于习惯，试图说服自己内心尚存一丝人性。有时，她也会小憩片刻，陷入无梦的沉眠，醒来后却毫无变化；她始终疲惫，始终愤怒，始终感觉糟糕透顶。体内肆虐的病痛使她比真嗣的行为更显得像个怪物。她在牢房中所说的那些话，每一句都是发自内心的。

Her body twitched, pain erupting from her covered eye, and Asuka almost jumped from the chair she had been resting on for the past four hours. It took her a few seconds to get her bearings back, and upon recognizing the house's surroundings, the first thing she noticed was the absence of a certain prisoner who was supposed to be sleeping or laying on the ground. She certainly recalled that at some point in the last hour, Shinji had risen and covered her with the same blanket she had used to protect him from the cold. A few minutes before opening her eye, Asuka had heard him get up and open the door. _Probably ran away, the brat. Wouldn't that be fun, huh?_  
她的身体抽搐了一下，被遮住的眼睛传来剧痛，这让明日香几乎从她已经休息了四个小时的椅子上跳了起来。她花了好几秒钟才重新稳住心神，当她认出屋内的环境时，首先注意到的是本应在地上睡觉或躺着的某个囚犯不见了。她确实记得在过去的一个小时里的某个时刻，真嗣起身并用她用来保护他免受寒冷的同一条毯子盖住了她。在睁开眼睛前的几分钟，明日香听到他起身并打开了门。大概是逃走了吧，那个小鬼。那不是很有趣吗，嗯？

"Stupid," she muttered, and was about to march out inthe small hours in search for her captive when Shinji opened the door and stepped inside, a handful of strange herbs in his bandaged hand. He had taken off the jacket, she noticed, which made the covered area on his arm that much more noticeable. "What the hell is that, and who told you to go outside?" she barked, pointing at the sprouts with a glare.  
“笨蛋，”她低声咒骂，正准备在凌晨时分出去寻找她的俘虏时，真嗣打开了门，手里抓着一把奇怪的草药走了进来。她注意到他已经脱掉了夹克，这使得他手臂上被包裹的区域更加显眼。“那是什么鬼东西，谁让你出去的？”她厉声问道，用手指着那些嫩芽，眼神凌厉。

"Good morning, Asuka," responded the Third Child in a slow murmur; his body language let her know that he was faring much better than the day before. He was not shaking, his skin was not as pale and his eyes were not as unfocused, yet they were still very much gone. His movements, although somewhat healthier, were still stiff and uncoordinated.  
"早上好，明日香。" 第三适格者缓缓低语回应；他的肢体语言告诉她，他比昨天好多了。他没有颤抖，肤色不再那么苍白，眼神也不再那么涣散，但依旧显得空洞。尽管动作稍微健康些，却依然僵硬且不协调。

"I found some… chamomile just outside and thought I'd make some tea." He refused to make eye contact, as was expected, eyes shifting between the plants held in his palm and the floor. "Would you like some?"  
"我在外面找到了一些…甘菊，想着泡点茶。" 他拒绝直视，正如所料，目光在手中的植物和地板之间游移。"你想来点吗？"

_Some tea?_ _**Tea**__? To go with what, with the tasteless freaking food bars I'm supposed to push down your throat, idiot?_ Instead of the well-thought of, and well-prepared retort dancing at the tip of her tongue, the Major simply raised a skeptical eyebrow and glared. He was speaking more fluently, as well, even when his eyes were still very much expressionless. "How do you even know that stuff's chamomile?" she said with an accusatory tone. She noticed he had trouble finding a way to articulate the words. Quickly running out of patience, Asuka turned back to the room and shrugged. "I don't care, do what you want. Don't waste the gas, there's precious little as it is."  
来点茶？茶？配什么，配那些我得硬塞进你嘴里的无味食物棒吗，白痴？本想用精心准备的反驳狠狠回击，但玛丽亚少校只是挑了挑怀疑的眉毛，瞪了他一眼。他的话流畅了许多，尽管眼神依旧毫无波澜。“你怎么知道那是甘菊茶？”她带着质问的语气说道。她注意到他在寻找合适的措辞时有些困难。耐心迅速耗尽，明日香转回房间，耸了耸肩。“我不在乎，随你便。别浪费煤气，本来就不多了。”

The echo of slow, tentative footsteps informed the Second Child the brat was well on his way to squandering her resources on making tea of all things. "Right," she heard him say. "I'll be careful."  
缓慢而试探的脚步声告诉二号适格者，那小鬼正打算浪费她的资源去泡茶，真是够了。“好吧，”她听到他说，“我会小心的。”

Asuka picked up the broken down cellphone and the small console, marched over to the door and slammed it shut, forgetting about Shinji's offer altogether_._ His slow way of speaking and delayed reactions irked her beyond reason. _What the hell is wrong with me?_ The rage was there, unyielding and coiling against her chest as always; the rotten sensation of absolute lonesomeness was crushing her ribcage as was custom, as well. And yet, something was definitely amiss. It was getting harder to ignore the boy's bandaged hand, and the words in that little video reverberated ceaselessly in her head, even as she collapsed on the stiff mattress and began to play with the WonderSwan. _Stupid freaking Suzuhara asking stupid questions, what does it matter to you how he got the stupid cut, you dumb freaking jock?_ The buttons of her handheld cracked ever so slightly as she applied more force than necessary.  
明日香捡起破损的手机和小巧的掌机，大步走向门口，砰地一声关上门，完全忘记了真嗣的提议。他那慢吞吞的说话方式和迟钝的反应让她气不打一处来。我到底是怎么了？怒火如常，顽强地在胸中盘旋；那种彻底孤独的腐烂感觉也一如既往地压迫着她的胸腔。然而，有些事情确实不对劲。她越来越难以忽视男孩包扎的手，而那段小视频中的话语在她脑海中不断回响，即便她倒在硬邦邦的床垫上开始玩起 WonderSwan。该死的铃原问些蠢问题，他怎么受的伤关你屁事，你这个蠢蛋运动员？她用力过猛，掌机按键微微发出裂响。

Every time the bandages came into view, every _single_ time, her stomach felt even emptier than usual. The fever, the hollow cheeks, the bruise on his forehead… _Screw it, screw him and his little fit. Screw that cut. Yeah, you elbowed him, you hit him. You did that. He hit you, as well, didn't he?_ Major Shikinami remarked; hands gaining speed as she went through the levels of the game with ease. _Someone important to you. Yeah, right. Like we even got to know each other enough to be…_ He had been smiling that day as he handed her the Bento.  
每当那些绷带映入眼帘，每一次，她的胃都感觉比平时更加空虚。高烧、凹陷的双颊、他额头上的瘀伤……去他的，去他的小脾气。去他的伤口。没错，你肘击了他，你打了他。是你干的。他也打了你，不是吗？碇司令评论道；双手随着她在游戏中轻松过关而加速。对你来说重要的人。是啊，没错。好像我们甚至足够了解彼此去成为……那天他微笑着递给她便当。

In the solitary existence that was her excuse of a life, bred and trained as a dog of war since she had first opened her eyes, her time in Tokyo had been about the only thing close to normalcy she had ever experienced. And now, fourteen years after, she had seared a permanent mark in the wrist of the boy who had offered her that small box, so long ago. _It_ _**doesn't**_ _matter._ The Major reminded her in a hushed whisper. _So what? He all but bit me in half, and if I wasn't already inhuman enough, I'm now a freak mixed in with some unholy monster._  
在她那孤独存在的借口般的生活中，自从她第一次睁开眼睛就被培养成战争的狗，她在东京的时光几乎是她所经历过的唯一接近正常的事情。而现在，十四年后，她在很久以前递给她那个小盒子的男孩手腕上留下了永久的烙印。没关系。司令在她耳边低语提醒。那又怎样？他几乎把我咬成两半，如果我还不够非人，现在我更是一个混杂着某种邪恶怪物的畸形。

Right before her Synch test with Unit 03 there had been… emotions, thoughts, all of them unfamiliar, rattling in her brain and chest, most of them revolving around him. Then he had given her an eye-patch, and a permanent illness which did not even allow her body or brain to grow old. Major Shikinami nodded her approval, but Asuka shook her head, turning off the game with a deep sigh. _Yeah, and now I gave him a scar he's going to carry for the rest of his life, however short it is._ The choker on her neck felt stifling all of the sudden; the one around his surely felt the same. _Four days. You left him in that cage for four days._  
在与 3 号机同步测试前夕，她的脑海和胸中充斥着种种陌生情绪与思绪，大多与他有关。随后，他赠予她一只眼罩，以及一种令她身心无法老去的永久病症。式波少校点头表示认可，但明日香却摇头叹息，关掉了游戏。是啊，如今我给了他一道将伴随其短暂余生的伤疤。她颈上的项圈突然感到窒息般的压迫；他的想必亦然。四天。你将他囚于那笼中四天。

Why was it becoming hard to stay angry at him? He had betrayed her, after all; Shinji had fought against her. His inaction had cost her whatever fading meaning had been offered in her young life, or so she liked to believe. _And you almost left him to die. Look at him. He's not even there. He was unresponsive for more than five days. You put on those cuffs too tightly, and you knew it. Then you let him sit with that wound, and it festered to the point that it'll leave a nasty mark. And he barely even felt it; the idiot's probably gonna burn the house down trying to make his stupid tea._ Her eye twitched; the damned memory of the cellphone returned.  
为什么越来越难对他生气了呢？他毕竟背叛了她，毕竟真嗣与她为敌。他的不作为让她年轻生命中本就稀薄的意义荡然无存，至少她是这么认为的。而你几乎让他自生自灭。看看他，他甚至不在状态。他已无反应超过五天。你把那些手铐扣得太紧，你自己也知道。然后你让他带着那伤口坐着，结果伤口恶化到会留下难看的疤痕。而他几乎没感觉到；这傻瓜可能为了泡那愚蠢的茶会把房子给烧了。她的眼角抽搐了一下；那该死的手机记忆又回来了。

"_You should just go and lose someone important to you!"_  
"你应该去失去一个对你重要的人！"

She shifted on the covers, feeling uncomfortable. Heat and cold rarely bothered her, yet her skin felt frigid. It felt like an irresistible itch all of the sudden; she could charge the stupid cellphone battery with one of Kensuke's many chargers, finding one would not be a problem either. _What for?_ The Major demanded; her frown deepened. _You've seen it enough times, you know what happens._ If she tried, Asuka could picture the visage of Unit 01 crushing the tip of the Geo-Front, threatening to destroy it. Her hand was on its way to the old phone when a knock on her door froze the redhead in place.  
她在被单上挪了挪，感到不适。热和冷很少困扰她，但她的皮肤感觉冰冷。突然间，这感觉就像无法抗拒的痒；她可以用 Kensuke 的众多充电器之一给那愚蠢的手机电池充电，找到一个也不是问题。为了什么？司令要求；她的眉头皱得更深了。你已经看过太多次了，你知道会发生什么。如果她尝试，明日香可以想象出 01 号机碾碎 Geo-Front 顶端的景象，威胁着要摧毁它。她的手正伸向旧手机时，一阵敲门声让红发女孩僵在原地。

"What?" she growled, hand curling into a fist. Her shoulders tightened when no response came from the other side of the door "Ugh, come in, already."  
"什么事？" 她咆哮道，手握成拳头。当门外没有回应时，她的肩膀绷紧了，"呃，进来吧。"

The door opened and Shinji stepped in as though the room was a landmine field, every step more tentative and hesitant than the other. With the jacket on she could at the very least ignore the gauze, which to her strange and sudden relief showed no concerning stain of suppuration. The steaming glass held in the boy's hand shook slightly while his left held a plate with two protein bars. He stopped advancing towards her and decided to awkwardly stand a few feet away from the door and extend the glass in her direction. "Uhm, your tea."  
门开了，真嗣小心翼翼地踏入房间，仿佛置身于雷区，每一步都比上一步更加迟疑和踌躇。穿着夹克的她至少可以暂时忽略那层纱布，令她意外且突然地感到宽慰的是，纱布上并未显现出令人担忧的脓液污渍。男孩手中冒着热气的玻璃杯微微颤抖，左手则端着一个装有两根蛋白棒的盘子。他停下脚步，决定尴尬地站在离门几英尺远的地方，将玻璃杯朝她递去。“呃，你的茶。”

_I don't want it, you freaking child. I don't need it, I don't need_ _**anything**__, not food, nor drink, especially not tea, not from you._ Regardless of the Major's demands inside her aching head, Asuka rose from bed and almost snatched the hot glass from him. The scent was unmistakable; the idiot had actually gone and found chamomile. Back when she had had two useful eyes and the world had not been broken into pieces, Asuka recalled how Shinji's gaze would nervously travel between her and the floor, the way he would try to hide from the fact that he was staring. Now, though, he simple stared at a place between her feet and the ground, eyes vacant.  
我不要，你这个烦人的小鬼。我不需要，我什么都不需要，食物也好，饮料也罢，尤其是茶，更不是你给的。尽管脑海中上校的要求让她头痛欲裂，明日香还是从床上起身，几乎是从他手中夺过了那杯热玻璃杯。那气味再明显不过；这个傻瓜竟然真的去找了洋甘菊。在她还有两只看得见的眼睛，世界还没有支离破碎的时候，明日香记得真嗣的目光是如何紧张地在她和地板之间游移，他试图掩饰自己在盯着她的事实。然而现在，他只是盯着她脚和地面之间的一个点，眼神空洞。

"Such a waste," she said more spitefully than intended, and grumbled low in her throat when the comment elicited no reaction from Shinji. "Using gas to boil water for some herb juice, pff. Next time you can help yourself to the wood and make a fire, brat. That's the last of the house's resources you squander."  
“真是浪费，”她的话比原本打算的还要刻薄，当这番话没有引起真嗣的任何反应时，她低声咕哝着。“用煤气烧水泡草汁，呸。下次你自己去砍柴生火吧，小鬼。这是你挥霍掉的家里最后的资源了。”

When he failed to so much as nod at her statement, Asuka felt like throwing the hot tea on him to see if he would react at last. The grip on the glass increased; seeing both the bandages and the collar made the unease she had been tormented with for the past few days rouse and spread over her senses. She took a drink, blinking at the faint aftertaste that lingered on her tongue. It was rare that she was able to taste a thing, anymore, and yet… the smell and taste of chamomile began to slowly relax her tense muscles, despite the redhead's best efforts to keep them strained and on high alert.  
当他连对她的话点头回应都做不到时，明日香有种想把热茶泼在他身上看他是否终于会有反应的冲动。握着玻璃杯的手加重了力道；看到绷带和衣领，过去几天一直困扰她的不安感再次涌上心头，蔓延至她的感官。她喝了一口，眨眼间品味着留在舌尖上的淡淡余味。如今她能尝到东西已是难得，然而……甘菊的香气和味道开始慢慢舒缓她紧绷的肌肉，尽管红发女孩竭力保持它们的紧张和高度警觉。

"I…" Shinji muttered, and extended the small plate in her direction. "I found these. Thought you might be hungry."  
“我……” 真嗣喃喃道，将小盘子朝她递去。“我找到了这些。想着你可能饿了。”

"I'm not." Downing the hot beverage in a rush, the Major almost pushed the glass back into Shinji's chest; he was slow to retrieve it. "I told _you_ to eat. Now gulp that down before I decide to do it for you again."  
"我没生气。" 少校急匆匆地喝下热饮，差点把杯子推回真嗣的胸前；他慢吞吞地接过杯子。"我告诉过你吃东西。现在快喝完，不然我又要帮你了。"

Shinji nodded, turning to walk off the room without another word after her not-so-subtle warning sank in. From the corner of her eye, she watched him sit on the table and begin to nibble at one of the bars as he measuredly drank from his own cup. The smell of chamomile floated all through the house; how come Kensuke had never found those stupid little flowers before? The discomfort returned as she stood just barely out of the boy's sight and watched him eat. The military coat began to feel stifling; Asuka noticed she had buttoned it up all the way to her neck the night before. How would he react, she wondered, if he saw her collar? Would he even care at all?  
真嗣点点头，在她那不甚隐晦的警告下，一言不发地转身离开房间。她用眼角余光看到他坐在桌边，开始小口咬着一根能量棒，同时有条不紊地喝着自己的杯子。洋甘菊的香气弥漫了整个屋子；为什么健介之前从未找到过那些愚蠢的小花呢？她站在男孩视线之外，看着他进食，不适感再次袭来。军装外套开始感到闷热；明日香注意到自己昨晚一直扣到了脖子。她想，如果他看到她的衣领，会有什么反应？他会在意吗？

_Why would he? And why the hell would I even care? I'm not even human, anymore. Just trapped a human's body, nothing more, s_he pondered in disgust; the rage started to boil in satisfying fashion once more. How come it was now more directed at the way her life had ended up, and not at him, per se? She had believed for over fourteen years that she'd never see the idiot again. She recalled Mari's words, and the dry explanation Ritsuko had offered so many years before, detailing to her in a very disgustingly scientific manner how Shinji was positively dead for all intents and purposes. One call of his name from a few hundred meters away, in the middle of freaking space, with no rational reasoning or explanation of how or if he had heard it at all, and then the Angel was wiped out.  
他为何要这么做？我又为何要在意？我已经不再是人类了，只是被困在人类的躯壳里，仅此而已，她厌恶地思索着；怒火再次以令人满意的方式沸腾起来。为何现在更多地是针对自己生活的结局，而非针对他本身？她曾坚信十四年之久，再也不会见到那个白痴。她回想起玛丽的言辞，以及多年前赤木律子那干巴巴的解释，以一种极其令人厌恶的科学方式向她详细说明，从所有实际目的来看，真嗣已经彻底死了。在浩瀚的太空中，相隔数百米，没有任何合理的理由或解释他是如何或是否听到了她的呼唤，只一声他的名字，然后那使徒便被消灭了。

_Fourteen years of nothing, fourteen years of assuming you were nothing but LCL._ Pushing her fisted hands into the coat, Asuka walked out of the room and went to sit opposite to the Third Child, with the eye-patch facing him. Her hair was loose for once, devoid of the neural clips. _Not that this brat will even notice, or care for that matter. And why the hell does that matter to me? It was just a stupid video, Asuka. It doesn't change anything. You don't need to feel anything, it's pointless. You've grown out of it, and he, pff, he can't even process reality. Why the hell does he keep looking at the stupid roundels?!_  
十四年空无一物，十四年里一直以为你不过是 LCL。她将拳头塞进外套，走出房间，坐在第三适格者对面，眼罩朝向他。她的头发难得散开，没有神经夹的束缚。这小子根本不会注意到，更别说在乎了。我他妈干嘛在乎这些？不过是一段愚蠢的视频，明日香。什么都没改变。你不需要有任何感觉，毫无意义。你已经走出来了，而他，哼，连现实都处理不了。他到底为什么一直盯着那些该死的圆徽？！

The silence stretched between them, interrupted by the sound of Shinji's quiet eating. Several minutes after he was done he sat there, staring at the empty plate without even blinking often, eyes darting ever so frequently to the hat_. Putting that stupid blanket on him was a mistake. You tried to do something for someone else once. Yeah, for that brat. And it cost you everything._ One look at the clock on the wall and Asuka realized she had not only slept more than her accustomed two hours every four to five days, but also that she had not heard Shinji get up and exit the house. If he was so damn broken, how come he had taken the blanket and covered her with it?  
沉默在他们之间蔓延，被真嗣安静进食的声音打断。吃完几分钟后，他坐在那里，盯着空盘子，连眼睛都很少眨，目光时不时地飘向那顶帽子。给他盖上那条愚蠢的毯子是个错误。你曾试图为别人做点什么。是的，为了那个小鬼。而这让你失去了所有。瞥了一眼墙上的时钟，明日香意识到自己不仅睡了超过习惯中的每四到五天的两小时，而且还没听到真嗣起床离开家的声音。如果他如此破碎不堪，为何还要拿毯子给她盖上呢？

"Suzuhara's bound to arrive soon," she stated. "I don't know, nor do I care where he'll be taking you. He's also going to redress that cut. Get yourself ready. And by that I mean get in the shower." She waited a few seconds, for a reaction, and upon hearing him begin to rise from his chair breathed in a small sigh of relief. He was speaking less, but at least the brat continued to obey simple commands. "Don't get the bandages wet."  
"铃原应该很快就到了，" 她宣布道。"我不知道，也不在乎他会带你去哪儿。他还会处理你那伤口。准备好自己。我的意思是去洗个澡。" 她等了几秒钟，期待着他的反应，听到他从椅子上起身时，她轻轻地松了一口气。他话少了，但至少这小子还在继续听从简单的命令。"别让绷带沾水。"

The sound of Shinji gently placing the plates and glasses on the sink made her shift her gaze, the redhead caught the moment when he grazed the spot where the wound was against the counter and hiss quietly to himself. The image of the infection returned; flesh becoming purple and red and pink all over, pus leaking out of the cut, the edges widening with each day that bacteria feasted on the damaged tissue. It was bound to leave a permanent mark.  
真嗣轻轻将盘子和杯子放在水槽边的声音让她转移了视线，红发女子捕捉到他擦过伤口处时，轻轻地倒吸了一口气。感染的画面再次浮现；肉体变得紫红交错，脓液从伤口中渗出，边缘随着细菌每日侵蚀受损组织而不断扩大。这注定会留下永久的痕迹。

Her jaw tightened in an effort to say nothing, to no avail. "That shouldn't have happened," the words bled out of her despite the Major's best efforts to bury them. The hollowness was stifling; the weight of it felt it would drown her anger at any given point.  
她紧咬牙关，试图保持沉默，但无济于事。"那本不该发生，" 尽管少校尽力压抑，这些话还是脱口而出。空虚感令人窒息；那份沉重似乎随时都能淹没她的愤怒。

"Huh?" For once ever since offering the tea, Shinji reacted with more than silent compliance. "What do you m-"  
"啊？" 自从递上茶以来，真嗣第一次有了超过沉默顺从的反应。"你说什么——"

"That wound on your wrist. You don't even remember, do you?" Watching him shake his head only managed to drive the nausea deeper into her belly. Of course he had no memory of it. "I put those cuffs on you. I put them on too tightly, and twisted them. That wasn't supposed to happen."  
"你手腕上的伤口。你甚至不记得了，对吧？" 看着他摇头，只让恶心感更深地侵入她的腹部。当然，他不记得了。"是我给你戴上了手铐。我戴得太紧，还扭了一下。那不是应该发生的事。"

Shinji paused, taken aback, reacting quicker than she had seen in the last few days. "What? Cuffs? I don't…" His gaze shifted to the injured hand. "Is that… what happened?"  
真嗣顿了一下，显得有些吃惊，反应比她这几天看到的都要快。“什么？手铐？我不……”他的目光转向了受伤的手。“那是……怎么回事？”

"Yes, it was." Asuka turned her head to glare at the wall. "Sure, you let it fester to the point of considering amputation, but it shouldn't have been there in the first place." She rose in a flash, hands still deep in the jacket pockets, and walked over to the door. A bit of fresh air was sure to ease the unrest the stupid bandages ignited. The video flashed in her mind for the umpteenth time. "Careful with the gauze. Do as you're told, brat. Shower. Second door to your right. Towels are next to the mirror."  
“是的，就是那样。”明日香转过头，怒视着墙壁。“当然，你让它恶化到考虑截肢的地步，但一开始就不该有这问题。”她迅速起身，双手仍深深插在夹克口袋里，走向门口。一点新鲜空气肯定能平息这些愚蠢绷带引发的烦躁。那段视频在她脑海中再次闪现，已经不知是第几次了。“小心点换纱布。照吩咐的做，小鬼。洗澡。右边第二个门。毛巾在镜子旁边。”

Apparently still in a daze from the information he had just received; Asuka watched him move what looked like extremely stiff limbs and enclose himself in the bathroom. The Major glowered. _What the hell was that, huh? What was that? Shouldn't have happened, what? You know what shouldn't have happened? Him attacking me; now_ _**that**_ _shouldn't have happened. Him trying to end the world, maybe that. Has he even tried to apologize for that? Of course not. Stupid brat can hardly talk._ Despite her initial thoughts, the crisp morning air did little to settle her mood; having him in the house and barely reacting to her at all was getting increasingly annoying.  
显然，他还沉浸在刚刚得知的信息中，恍惚不已；明日香看着他移动着看似僵硬无比的四肢，将自己关进了浴室。这位少校皱起了眉头。那到底是什么鬼？那是什么？本不该发生的，对吧？你知道什么本不该发生吗？他攻击我；现在那才是不该发生的。他试图终结世界，也许是那样。他为此道歉过吗？当然没有。那个愚蠢的小鬼连话都说不利索。尽管如此，清晨的凉爽空气并未能平息她的情绪；他在屋里，对她几乎毫无反应，这越来越让她感到恼火。

Her life had always been empty, fueled by nothing short of the basic instinct to survive and thrive. How many like her own had she defeated, if only to see the light of the next day? How long had she been living one day after the other, not truly realizing if time passed or not? It was always so cold. Even clad in the military coat, she shivered; her covered eye itched and her mood worsened with every passing second.  
她的生活一直空洞无物，仅凭着生存和繁衍的基本本能维系。她击败了多少像她一样的存在，只为能看到第二天的曙光？她日复一日地活着，是否真正意识到时间的流逝？总是那么冷。即便裹着军大衣，她仍瑟瑟发抖；被遮住的眼睛发痒，她的心情每况愈下。

"I'm so tired of looking after this dumb brat," she whispered, eye fixed on the green patches of forest. There was nothing waiting for her at the village, nothing except the stares. Lilim had long since become annoying. "I've always been alone. I'd much rather be alone than with him," came the quiet statement; her tone grew increasingly melancholic without her realizing it. "Of course that brat wouldn't make any difference. He never did. He doesn't do anything, and when he does it backfires and makes everything worse." He was weak; Shinji was both weak of mind and body, and more than useless in his current state. "Pathetic."  
"我真是受够了照顾这个蠢小子，"她低声抱怨，目光紧锁着森林中那片绿意。村子里并没有什么在等她，除了那些目光。莉莉姆早已变得令人厌烦。"我一直都是一个人。我宁愿独自一人，也不愿和他在一起，"她平静地陈述着，语气中不自觉地流露出愈发浓重的忧郁。"当然，那小子不会有什么改变。他从没改变过。他什么也不做，即便做了也只会适得其反，让一切变得更糟。"他既心智脆弱又身体孱弱，现在的他更是毫无用处。"可悲。"

It was unclear to her which was more pathetic; his attitude and actions, or her stupid thoughts. Why the hell had he made her feel accompanied that one time? The recollection was brutally suppressed; she refused to remember the night in Misato's apartment, along with the sensation of companionship and warmth it brought about. _It doesn't matter. Nothing matters. Nothing except the next mission. You're alone, Asuka._ The festering wound and dead stare flashed through her mind. _And it's for the best._  
她不清楚哪个更可悲：是他的态度和行为，还是她愚蠢的想法。他究竟为何那一次让她感到陪伴？这段回忆被她残忍地压制；她拒绝记起在美里公寓的那个夜晚，以及随之而来的陪伴感和温暖。无所谓。一切都无所谓。除了下一个任务，什么都不重要。你是孤独的，明日香。那溃烂的伤口和死寂的眼神在她脑海中闪过。这样最好。

The wood and metal constructing the restroom wall stared back at Shinji as he stood there, motionless. He was supposed to shower and go with Toji to the village. Why? Every person there probably detested him as much as the crew members of the Wunder, if not more. There was no point in him going out, there was no point in him doing anything, anymore. The memories of being pushed and dragged through the remains of a city, all cloaked in red, had begun to resurface. Gigantic arms stretching from the ground, a bloodied, cross-covered moon hovering above, the scent of blood at every turn, on each corner. Asuka's glare, disappointment and disgust with his person. Rei, or rather, a different Rei.  
洗手间墙壁上的木头和金属材质在静止不动的 Shinji 面前回望着他。他本该洗澡然后和 Toji 一起去村子里的。为什么？那里的每个人可能都像 Wunder 号的船员一样讨厌他，甚至更甚。他出去没有意义，他做任何事都没有意义了。被推搡着穿过一片红色笼罩的城市废墟的记忆开始重新浮现。从地面伸出的巨大手臂，血染的、十字架覆盖的月亮高悬其上，每个转角都弥漫着血的气息。Asuka 对他的瞪视，失望和厌恶。Rei，或者说，另一个 Rei。

What was the point of it all? He was to continue living and take care of himself survive and fulfill whatever it was the Second Child wanted him to do. _She won't let me just disappear, because I don't deserve something as good as death. I have to carry on. Shower._ Barely acknowledging his own reflection in the mirror, Shinji undressed and stepped in the small, reconstructed space and let the cold water impact his skin, minding to keep the bandages out of the way. "Shouldn't have happened," he muttered, shivering lightly. He had taken the antibiotic right along with the food rations, as instructed by Toji the day before.  
这一切的意义何在？他将继续生活，照顾好自己，生存下去，完成二号机驾驶员希望他做的任何事情。她不会让我就这样消失，因为我还不配得到死亡这样美好的解脱。我必须继续前行。洗澡。几乎无视镜中自己的倒影，真嗣脱下衣服，踏入狭小重建的空间，任由冷水冲击皮肤，小心避开绷带。“本不该发生的，”他轻声嘀咕，微微颤抖。按照昨天明日香的要求，他按时服用了抗生素和食物配给。

His memory became fuzzy after leaving the house where the bandages had been replaced and the wound cleansed. There was a hazy recollection of Asuka taking him by the arm, walking through what felt like a while until they reached the house. He shivered; the aches and tremors were slowly starting to fade; his wrist would throb constantly and flare if he moved his hand too much, but the pain was barely registered. _I wish I could just not think, just…_ The words he had last read in the dictionary bounced in his head.  
离开那所更换绷带并清洁伤口的房子后，他的记忆变得模糊。隐约记得明日香拉着他手臂，穿过仿佛漫长的路途，最终到达了那所房子。他颤抖着；疼痛和颤抖正逐渐消退；手腕会持续抽痛，如果手部动作过大还会加剧，但疼痛已几乎不被察觉。我真希望自己能停止思考，就那样……他最近在字典里读到的词句在脑海中回荡。

Inaction. 无所作为。

Precisely due to his unwillingness to do anything Unit 03 had been brutally destroyed, and his desire to disappear had only earned him a disease and a heavily infected cut. Why was it, then, that all he still wanted to do was to curl up and die in some corner? _All I ever do is hurt people,_ he mused while toweling off; a faint glimpse at the gauze ensured it had not gotten soaked during the brief shower. Smaller, not so extreme quakes continued to run up and down his body until he finished redressing. His nose caught the faint scent of strawberries.  
正因为他不愿采取任何行动，零三号机才被残忍地摧毁，而他渴望消失的愿望只换来了一场疾病和一道严重感染的伤口。为何他仍只想蜷缩在某个角落里死去？“我所做的无非是伤害他人。”他一边用毛巾擦干身体，一边沉思；瞥了一眼纱布，确认在短暂的淋浴中没有被浸湿。轻微的颤抖持续在他身上上下游走，直到他重新包扎完毕。他的鼻尖捕捉到了一丝草莓的淡淡香气。

The image of blood splattering all over the Entry Plug had awoken him early in the morning; every now and then the flashback returned with a vengeance. He caught a glimpse of the DSS choker in the mirror and felt a wave of heavy nausea assault him, eyes quickly darting over to the door. In an attempt to calm his aching head the sudden need to retch, Shinji picked up a wooden spoon lying next to a water bowl and drank several times. The dizziness abated to an extent; the agony clouding his mind only seemed to increase as he dressed.  
驾驶舱内血花四溅的画面一大早便将他惊醒；那恐怖的闪回时不时地以更加猛烈的姿态袭来。他在镜中瞥见 DSS 项圈，一阵强烈的恶心感如潮水般涌来，目光迅速转向门口。为了平复那突如其来的呕吐感和剧痛的头部，真嗣抓起水碗旁的一把木勺，连饮数次。晕眩感有所缓解；然而，随着他穿衣，脑海中的痛楚却愈发浓重。

Out there, in whichever place they were, everyone had been subjected to his foolishness and were probably forced to struggle in order to see the following day. _And it's all my fault. I did all this, and I can't even starve myself in peace. Why do I have to do anything?_ A jab of vicious rebelliousness almost managed to make him consider forgetting all about Asuka's words and her ridiculous demands, even living to serve out some long, painful life felt like too good a castigation. "Failure to do anything," He recited, despite his psyche being all but shattered into a million pieces, the words in the dictionary were seared into whatever awareness he still possessed. "That might provide a solution to a problem."  
在那边，无论他们身处何地，每个人都遭受了他的愚蠢之举，或许还被迫挣扎着迎接第二天的到来。这一切都是我的错。我一手造成了这些，却连安安静静地饿死自己都做不到。为什么我非得做些什么？一股恶毒的反叛冲动几乎让他考虑忘掉明日香的话和她那些荒谬的要求，甚至苟活一段漫长而痛苦的人生都显得过于宽恕了。“无所作为，”他喃喃自语，尽管心灵已支离破碎，那些字典里的词句仍烙印在他仅存的意识中。“那或许能解决一个问题。”

He tried clenching his fist and the cut underneath the gauze burned its displeasure into his pain receptors. "Lack of action when some is expected or appropriate." He muttered in monotone; whenever he focused on the words, or on the recollection of the last song in the cassette, his mind relaxed. Kaworu's body exploding was momentarily suppressed under the image of that cap, and the two roundels stuck to the black material.  
他试着握紧拳头，纱布下的伤口便灼烧着向他的痛觉神经表达不满。“在预期或适当的时候缺乏行动。”他喃喃自语，语调平淡；每当他专注于这些词句，或是回忆起磁带里的最后一首歌时，思绪便得以放松。渚薰身体爆炸的画面暂时被那顶帽子和粘在黑色布料上的两个圆形徽章所掩盖。

Once he exited the restroom, Shinji realized for the first time that the house had two bedrooms, a bathroom and the living room-kitchen; the small futon where he had slept the night before laid on a corner with both the jacket and book resting on the soft material. Voices filtered from the other side of the door; he recognized Asuka's clipped responses and Toji's somewhat amiable inquiries, and felt his limbs grow increasingly heavy. _I don't want to go anywhere,_ he realized. _I don't want to do anything. Every time I do something, everybody gets hurt. I should just die, but I can't._  
从洗手间出来后，真嗣第一次意识到这房子有两间卧室、一个浴室和客厅兼厨房；昨晚他睡的小被褥放在角落里，夹克和书都放在柔软的被褥上。门另一边的声音传来；他认出了明日香简短的回应和东治略带友好的询问，感到四肢越来越沉重。我不想去任何地方，他意识到。我不想做任何事。每次我做些什么，每个人都会受伤。我应该去死，但我做不到。

"Redemption," he spat out quietly, lightly glaring at the floor. _What a joke, as is I could ever make it up for ev-_  
“赎罪，”他轻声吐出这个词，轻轻瞪着地板。真是个笑话，好像我能弥补什么似的——

The door opened, derailing his train of thought, and the elder Suzuhara came walking in with a placid smile. "Hey, Ikari. You're looking a bit better, already. Did you make those soups I gave you? And did you take the antibiotics?"  
门开了，打断了他的思绪，铃原大哥带着平静的微笑走了进来。“嘿，碇。你看起来已经好些了。我给你的汤做了吗？还有抗生素吃了吗？”

His gaze shifted, absent eyes drawing to the man who had once been his schoolmate. So many years had passed, so much hurting brought about to everyone just because he tried to save somebody important after failing. "Hi, Toji," he muttered; cobalt orbs dancing between the man in the coat and the wooden floor under his feet. He was wearing the pants offered to him in the vessel; the shirt did little to cover his skin from the cold gush of wind that snuck through the opened door. "Yeah," producing the package which contained the pills, Shinji showed the first two had already been consumed. "One in the morning… and in the afternoon."  
他的目光游移，茫然的眼神落在了曾是同学的那个人身上。岁月荏苒，只因他试图在失败后拯救某个重要之人，便给所有人带来了如此多的伤害。“嗨，真嗣，”他低声道；钴蓝色的眼眸在穿大衣的男人和脚下的木地板间游移。他穿着在船上人家给的裤子；衬衫几乎无法抵御从敞开的门缝中钻入的寒风。“嗯，”他拿出装有药片的包裹，展示前两片已经服下。“早上一片……下午一片。”

"Great!" He pointed towards the table. "I'm glad you're feeling better. You're up and about and you're not shaking every few seconds. Please, take a seat." The former jock kept his positive attitude, noticing the Third Child's mental condition was the same, if not worse than the day before. "Let's see how that cut is doing, okay?"  
"太好了！" 他指向桌子。"很高兴你感觉好些了。你能起身走动，也不再每隔几秒就颤抖了。请坐。" 这位曾经的运动员保持着积极的态度，注意到第三子的精神状况与昨天相比，即便没有更糟，也依然如故。"让我们看看那伤口怎么样了，好吗？"

Shinji nodded and said nothing as Toji carefully looked over the bandages and prodded the area around the wound; it disturbed him to see the boy barely reacted each time he pressed against one the healing edges to see if any suppuration was present. His skin was no longer clammy or hot to the touch, which meant the worst of the fever had passed. _Looks to be healing well enough, I don't see any stains or moisture._ "I think we can wait until the afternoon until we change these. You've been really careful with it, huh?"  
真嗣点点头，一言不发，而东治则小心翼翼地检查着绷带，并轻触伤口周围；每次他按压正在愈合的边缘以检查是否有脓液时，男孩几乎毫无反应，这让他感到不安。他的皮肤不再湿冷或发热，这意味着最严重的烧已经退去。看起来愈合得不错，我没有看到任何污渍或湿气。“我觉得我们可以等到下午再更换这些。你一直很小心，对吧？”

Again, silence and a stiff nod were his answer as Shinji continued to stare at the ground; his arm barely twitched at all whilst the bandage was being analyzed. He watched a pair of cuffs lying on the ground, discarded far apart from the black cap and the game resting on the table. _So that's what happened, I think I remember her carrying those cuffs before they boarded. No wonder Shikinami can't even look at it._ Just as he had expected, she was in her perpetual terrible mood, yet something changed the night before, to be sure. The wrath in her eye was not so extreme; if he had to guess she looked like she was itching to ask or say something to Shinji. _She probably saw that video Kensuke told me about. Funny how she keeps calling Shinji a brat. All grown up, right, Major? Pff, yeah right._  
又一次，沉默和一个僵硬的点头是他的回答，因为真嗣继续盯着地面；当绷带被检查时，他的手臂几乎没有任何抽动。他看着一对手铐躺在地上，远远地被丢弃在黑色头盔和桌上的游戏旁边。原来如此，我想我记得她登船前带着那些手铐。难怪式波连看都不敢看。正如他所预料的，她一直处于糟糕的情绪中，但前一晚似乎发生了变化，确切无疑。她眼中的怒火没有那么强烈；如果他不得不猜测，她看起来像是急于向真嗣询问或说些什么。她可能看到了健介告诉我的那段视频。有趣的是，她一直称真嗣为小鬼。都长大了，对吧，少校？噗，没错。

"Well," The man rose, smile widening, and extended a hand towards the motionless teen who barely blinked at all as he stared at the ground. "You're definitely doing better. A little movement won't hurt, but we won't go all around the place today. I think there's plenty of time for that. Some fresh air, some hot food, some familiar faces."  
“好吧，”男人站起身，笑容扩大，向那位几乎不眨眼、盯着地面的少年伸出手。“你肯定在好转。稍微动动不会有害，但我们今天不会到处走动。我想还有的是时间。呼吸点新鲜空气，吃点热食，见见熟悉的面孔。”

_I really hopes it helps even a little, Shinji._ He pondered as they both headed for the door; Shinji's steps were steadier, he noticed, the fumbling of his feet had reduced considerably. He also caught how the boy's eyes momentarily drifted to the futon where a large book lay next to the red jacket. The air in the small house was permeated with tension, one which he suspected was not to diminish in the slightest even if he took the Third Child away. It was a welcomed blessing to step outside and smell the fresh morning air.  
我真的希望这能有所帮助，哪怕只是一点点，真嗣。他思索着，两人一同走向门口；他注意到，真嗣的步伐稳健了许多，脚步的踉跄也明显减少了。他还留意到，男孩的目光曾短暂地飘向那床铺，旁边放着一本大书和红色夹克。这间小屋内的空气弥漫着紧张，他怀疑即便带走了第三适格者，这种紧张感也丝毫不会减轻。能踏出屋外，呼吸到清晨的新鲜空气，实在是一种难得的慰藉。

"See ya, Shikinami!" Toji waved, walking towards the settlement. "Don't worry, Ikari's in good hands."  
“再见，式波！” 冬二挥着手，朝聚居地走去。“别担心，碇有好人照顾着呢。”

"Like I give a damn," snapped the redhead, and as though wanting to contradict herself marched into the house in a flash. "Hey, brat!"  
“谁在乎啊，”红发女孩厉声道，仿佛要反驳自己似的，一闪身进了屋。“嘿，小鬼！”

Shinji turned just in time to have the soft material impact against his face. The jacket almost slid into the ground, Toiji raised a surprised eyebrow upon realizing Shinji moved quicker than he'd seen all morning to keep the piece of fabric from falling on the moist grass. A swift, knowing smirk was hidden away as the elder Suzuhara averted his head to stare at the village.  
真嗣及时转身，柔软的布料迎面砸来。外套差点滑落到地上，冬二惊讶地扬起眉毛，意识到真嗣的动作比整个早上看到的都要快，迅速接住了差点落在湿润草地上的布料。老练的铃原转过头去凝视村庄，嘴角掠过一丝会意的微笑。

"It's cold, you dimwit." Asuka growled from the house. "Don't get it dirty." The door closed with a boisterous thud after she disappeared inside. A gush of cold morning breeze made Shinji shiver slightly; he held the fabric in between his hands, as through trying to understand the girl's incongruous actions with an already fractured, recovering mind. The task alone would break any man's psyche, sane or not.  
"冷死了，你个傻瓜。" 明日香从屋里吼道，"别弄脏了。" 她消失在门后，随即传来一声响亮的关门声。一阵清晨的寒风袭来，让真嗣不由得微微颤抖；他双手夹着那块布料，仿佛试图用已然破碎、正在恢复的心灵去理解女孩那不合逻辑的举动。光是这项任务就足以击溃任何人的心智，无论是否健全。

He patted the boy's shoulder, satisfied that the male pilot jumped slightly at the contact. "She's right, it's been cold lately."  
他拍了拍男孩的肩膀，满意地看到那位男飞行员在接触时微微一跳。“她说得对，最近确实挺冷的。”

"Okay," he said. Once clothed in the garment, both former classmates made their way into the village. The sound of chickens, dogs, birds and ultimately people became clear; Shinji's legs refused to work properly the more he neared the settlement. These were all people who had suffered because of him; whatever life they had aspired to build was certain to be difficult in the broken world he had left behind. His penance was now to look at the lives he had permanently altered and wallow even more in misery; as if there was anything at all he could possibly do to remedy destroying everything. _I don't want to do anything,_ he realized, forcing the stiff limbs forward. _I shouldn't do anything._  
"“好吧，”他说道。穿上衣服后，两位曾经的同学向村庄走去。鸡鸣、狗吠、鸟啼，以及最终的人声逐渐清晰；越接近村落，真嗣的双腿越不听使唤。这些人都因他而受苦；无论他们梦想建立怎样的生活，在这个他留下的破碎世界中注定艰难。他的赎罪就是直面这些被他永久改变的人生，更加沉溺于痛苦之中；仿佛他还能做些什么来弥补毁掉一切的罪行。他意识到，我不想做任何事，我不该做任何事。”

"Inaction," he muttered, barely loud enough for Toji to hear. The chilling sensation of regret and guilt curled and enveloped him, forcing cold into his skin despite the warmth Asuka's jacket offered. His feet felt unnaturally heavy, his body unresponsive; the sickness coursing through his veins had abated, giving ample space for the unimaginable shock and remorse which had forced him to try and initiate a true Third Impact.  
"“不作为，”他喃喃自语，声音小到只有冬二能听见。悔恨与内疚的寒意缠绕着他，尽管有明日香的外套保暖，仍感到皮肤冰冷。他的脚步异常沉重，身体反应迟钝；体内肆虐的疾病已消退，让位于难以想象的震惊与悔恨，这些情感曾迫使他试图引发真正的第三次冲击。”

"Hmm?" inquired the older man after a while, pretending he had not recognized the word.  
“嗯？”过了一会儿，年长者问道，假装没有认出这个词。

Shinji lowered his head even more the moment he realized more and more people were starting to appear. "Nothing." His tone came out weak and strained, almost shaking at the end. _He's probably expecting everyone out there to lynch him or something,_ Toji mused, eyes growing heavy with sympathy. _Can't blame him after the way Misato, Shikinami and everyone in Wunder have been treating him._ "Just… something I read."  
真嗣一意识到越来越多的人开始出现，头就垂得更低了。“没什么。”他的语气显得虚弱而紧张，几乎在最后颤抖起来。他大概以为外面的人会把他怎么样吧，东治想，眼中充满了同情。经历了美里、式波和 Wunder 上所有人对他的态度，这也不奇怪。“只是……我读到的一些东西。”

The black-haired man let a tight smile shine through his features. "Oh, you've been reading? That's great to know! Rei has been asking about some books, actually." It brightened Toji's mood to see a minimal, almost non-existent glimmer of curiosity dance in Shinji's eyes for a fraction of a second. "We're going over to my house right now; Rei's probably out in the fields, but she'll be home later today. If you feel up for it, we could try visiting the fields, as well."  
黑发男子脸上露出一丝紧绷的微笑。“哦，你在看书吗？这真是太好了！其实丽一直在问起一些书。”看到真嗣眼中闪过一瞬几乎难以察觉的好奇光芒，这让东治的心情稍稍明朗了些。“我们现在正要去我家；丽可能还在田里，但她今天晚些时候会回来。如果你觉得可以，我们也可以试着去田里看看。”

"The fields?" murmured the Third Child. Every step made him more ashamed, tensed his muscles with hesitation as regret made it impossible to properly grasp what was being said to him. "Rei is working in the fields?"  
"田野吗？" 第三适格者低声问道。每走一步，他都感到更加羞愧，犹豫不决让他的肌肉紧绷，后悔让他无法正确理解别人对他说的话。"零在田里工作？"

"Yeah, she was curious, still is, about lots of things." They were about to enter one of the living districts; Toji's keen eyes kept a firm vigil on the boy's behavior. Exposing him to people so early after his arrival had probably not been the best idea, however, there was hardly another way to have him see Rei. "There's lot of crops all over the place. This is Village -3, Shinji, one of the largest settlements."  
"是啊，她一直很好奇，现在也是，对很多事情都感兴趣。" 他们即将进入一个居住区；东治敏锐的目光紧紧盯着少年的行为。让他这么早接触人群可能不是最好的主意，然而，要让他见到零，几乎没有其他办法。"这里到处都是庄稼。这里是村子-3，真嗣，是最大的聚居地之一。"

"Hey, Suzuhara!" Came a sudden yell from his right. A large, bald, bearded man waved amiably at the pair, pausing just a few feet from them both. Shinji stared at the ground, head low, opting to enclose himself in his mind than to deal with the glares of strangers. "I heard the next shipment is about to arrive in a few days! Did Wunder follow through with the medical supplies?"  
"嘿，铃原！" 右边突然传来一声喊叫。一个高大、光头、留着胡须的男人友好地向两人挥手，停在离他们几英尺远的地方。真嗣低头盯着地面，宁愿将自己封闭在内心世界，也不愿面对陌生人的目光。"我听说下一批货物几天后就要到了！奇迹号把医疗用品送来了吗？"

Toji crossed his arms and smiled placidly. "Yeah, you bet they came through." He motioned towards Shinji, to which the man responded with a smirk of his own. "Did we get any other communication from Kredit?"  
冬二交叉双臂，平静地微笑着。“是啊，他们肯定能行。”他向真嗣示意，后者则回以一抹微笑。“我们还有收到克里迪特的其他通讯吗？”

"Not much, only a heads-up to get ourselves ready for a possible outage of resources in about a month," The larger man shrugged, shifting his gaze to the youth quietly standing beside Toji. "And I guess you would be Ikari, right?" With a nod that evidently went unseen, the man drank in the sight of the renowned Third Child. _Poor kid. Reminds me a lot of Shikinami._ "I'm Koga, nice to meet you!"  
“不多，只是提醒我们准备可能在下个月出现的资源中断，”高大的男子耸耸肩，将目光转向静静站在冬二身边的少年。“我想你就是碇君吧？”男子点了点头，显然未被察觉，他凝视着这位著名的第三适格者。可怜的孩子。让我想起了式波。“我是古贺，很高兴见到你！”

It was sad to see honest shock shine in the boy's gaze. "Nice to meet you." Shinji bowed his head and made eye contact with the bearded stranger; Koga tried his best not to cringe at the absolute, overwhelming defeat, misery and haziness in the youngster's gaze.  
看到男孩眼中闪现的真诚震惊，令人心酸。“很高兴见到你。”真嗣低头鞠躬，与留胡子的陌生人目光相接；古贺尽力不让自己因少年眼中那绝对的、压倒性的挫败、痛苦和迷茫而退缩。

The man tapped Toji's shoulder; they exchanged a knowing look and physician offered a minimal nod. "Send my love to the family, doc! Thanks for talking care of my boy's arm."  
那人轻拍了拍真治的肩膀；两人交换了一个心照不宣的眼神，医生微微点头。“代我向家人问好，医生！谢谢你照顾我儿子的胳膊。”

"You say that every time, it's been four months, already, Koga!" They shook hands and the man picked up the large bag he had been carrying, hurled it over his shoulder and began to walk away. "I'll give the family your love! And please do give my regards to yours!"  
“你每次都这么说，已经四个月了，古贺！”他们握了握手，那人提起一直背着的沉重背包，甩到肩上，开始离去。“我会向家人转达你的问候！也请代我向你的家人问好！”

"Will do! See ya, doc! Take care, Ikari!"  
"会做的！再见，医生！保重，碇！"

The mention of his last name made Shinji rear his head to the man's retreating back. He realized they were now standing amidst houses, railroad tracks and wagons. Women, men and children walked, some more hurriedly than others, laughing, joking and occasionally waving at Toji as he followed the older man wherever they were supposed to be going. The man continued to speak to him, going into detail about whatever this Kredit organization was and how they were the ones endorsing the village's existence and how their crops and fields worked. It all became white noise to him at some point.  
提到他的姓氏让真嗣抬头望向那人远去的背影。他意识到他们现在正站在房屋、铁轨和马车之间。男女老少或匆忙或悠闲地行走，有的笑着，有的开着玩笑，偶尔还有人向跟随在那位年长男子身后的东治挥手。那人继续向他详细解释这个名为“克雷迪特”的组织是如何支持村庄的存在，以及他们的农作物和田地是如何运作的。这一切在某一刻对他来说变成了白噪音。

Discomfort blossomed within his stomach and spread over his chest; amidst whatever little of reality he was able to comprehend, Shinji did notice something. There were no glares. The discomfort ripened and expanded, turning into something akin to annoyance or anger. Toji droned on about the systems in place made to prevent whatever he had done to the atmosphere from stopping the existence of human life, or how the hills and areas abandoned by the event's destruction were now quintessential for the continued production of food and water.  
不适感在他的胃里蔓延，扩散到胸口；尽管他能理解的现实有限，真嗣确实注意到了一些东西。没有敌视的目光。这种不适逐渐加剧，转化为类似恼怒或愤怒的情绪。东治继续喋喋不休地谈论着那些旨在防止他所做之事破坏大气层从而阻止人类生存的系统，或是那些因事件破坏而被遗弃的山丘和地区如今如何成为食物和水持续生产的关键。

His brow furrowed upon looking at the crimson coloring of the jacket he wore. Even Asuka was acting strange, lately. Her hatred he could take; he had fought her, after all, struck her and refused to listen, even when she had been the voice of reason in that situation. Being the brat he was, as she liked to call him nowadays, he had acted stupidly and Kaworu's body had exploded before him as a result. Of course, she was only making sure he did not get his wish of dying an easy, pointless death. _She didn't have to give you her jacket, though. And she did._  
他看着身上夹克的深红色泽，眉头紧锁。就连明日香最近也变得古怪起来。她的恨意他尚能承受；毕竟，他曾与她战斗，击打她，拒绝倾听，即便在那情境下她是理智的声音。正如她如今喜欢称呼他的那样，他是个小鬼，愚蠢行事，结果导致渚薰在他面前爆炸。当然，她只是确保他不会轻易迎来一场无意义的死亡。但她本不必把夹克给你。可她还是给了。

Greetings, happy waves and smiles were all around as he followed Toji; a blue sky filled with white clouds glared down at him, the smell of damp earth, animals and smoke registered in his tired brain, along with the scent of LCL and strawberries coming from the jacket he wore. The color did not sit well with him all of the sudden; dressed in red and white, he was sure to be easy to spot from far away. The inhabitants of the village would distinguish the harbinger of chaos and destruction, the living, breathing reason the moon was gigantic and cross-hatched with blood.  
问候声、欢快的波浪与微笑环绕四周，他紧随在 Toji 身后；蓝天白云俯瞰着他，潮湿泥土、动物与烟雾的气息在他疲惫的脑海中萦绕，还有他穿着的夹克上散发出的 LCL 与草莓香味。这颜色突然让他感到不适；身着红白相间的衣裳，他无疑在远处极易被辨认。村庄的居民将识别出混乱与毁灭的先兆，那个活生生的、呼吸着的理由，让月亮变得巨大且布满血痕。

More greetings, a dirt road that became sturdy rock, Toji saying something about the way the air was purified and the effects of the near Third Impact were minimized in the establishment; he grasped none of it. The unease was gaining strength and becoming unbearable with every friendly smile thrown his way. _Maybe they just don't know,_ he reasoned; his brow twitched. His hand clenched and unclenched, the gash by his wrist burned lightly. _Why would they smile like that, otherwise?_  
更多的问候，一条土路变成了坚硬的岩石，冬二说着空气如何被净化，以及在建立过程中近似第三次冲击的影响被最小化；他对此一无所知。不安感越来越强烈，每一张友好的笑脸都让他难以忍受。也许他们只是不知道，他这样想；他的眉头抽动了一下。他的手紧握又松开，手腕上的伤口微微灼痛。否则，他们为什么会那样笑呢？

"- and that right there is one of the main generators. Neat, isn't it? Without it, it'd be pretty hard for us to breathe. Hah, and look! See all those solar panels? Every house has its own electricity supply, not too much, but more than enough for what we need. Ah, look, here we are!" Shinji tried his best to remember the trail they had just walked through, or how long they had been walking; little came to receive him. There was a strange familiarity in the scenery, one he did not fully understand yet.  
“——那边就是主要的发电机之一。很整洁，不是吗？没有它，我们呼吸会很困难。哈哈，看！那些太阳能板看到了吗？每栋房子都有自己的电力供应，虽然不多，但足够我们所需。啊，看，我们到了！”真嗣尽力记住他们刚刚走过的路线，或者他们走了多久；但几乎没有印象。这里的景色有一种奇怪的熟悉感，他还没有完全理解。

The door to the house before him opened, revealing a brown-haired woman wearing an apron and, if Shinji had to guess, the sounds of a toddler behind her. "Hi, Toji! I didn't expect you so early! Oh, Ikari-kun! Welcome!"  
他面前的房门打开，一位棕发女子系着围裙出现在眼前，如果真嗣没猜错的话，她身后还传来了幼儿的声响。“嗨，阿守！没想到你这么早就来了！哦，一尓君！欢迎！”

His eyes broadened ever so slightly. "Hokari?" His eyes recognized a few of the freckles around her nose and cheeks. "I, thank you." She smiled at him as well, so did the other members of the household, right down to the eldest member of the Suzuhara family. Amiable conversation permeated the air of the living room, a vast contrast to the ambient in the house he had slept on the night before. They sat, asked him questions he barely answered with more than a few words forced through his stiff lips. Not even the fever's bone-crunching agony had felt this uncomfortable.  
他的眼睛微微睁大。“小鞠？”他认出了她鼻梁和脸颊周围的几颗雀斑。“我，谢谢你。”她也对他微笑，家里的其他成员，甚至包括铃原家最年长的长辈，都对他报以微笑。客厅里洋溢着亲切的交谈声，与他前一晚睡过的那所房子里的氛围形成了鲜明对比。他们坐下，问他问题，他勉强用僵硬的嘴唇挤出几个字回答。就连高烧带来的骨髓般的剧痛，也没有此刻这般难受。

Nobody said a word about the fact that he sat in a corner, hugging his knees to his chest and basically hiding his face from everyone as lunch was served. They offered him a bowl of stew, which he accepted and ate once Asuka's words rang back in his mind. Time became inconsistent; he was unable to grasp the meaning of what they said, and even the amount of people in the house was lost to him. Some came, left, others came around. They all greeted him with a smile, they all recognized him and smiled at him.  
没有人提及他蜷缩在角落里，双膝紧抱胸前，基本上将脸藏起来不让任何人看到，当午餐端上桌时。他们递给他一碗炖菜，他接受了并在脑海中回响起明日香的话后才开始吃。时间变得不连贯；他无法理解他们说的话，甚至连屋里的人数也记不清了。有人来，有人走，还有人转悠过来。他们都对他微笑，他们都认出了他，并向他微笑。

Shinji's jaw clenched. His hands gripped the jacket sleeves with vehemence.  
真嗣的下颚紧绷。他的双手紧紧抓住夹克袖子，充满了决心。

_Why are they being so nice? Why can't they be like the people in the ship?_ The cut burned as he pressed the bandaged area around his knee. The household members continued to amiably share details about their days and activities; it felt as though his presence was not even bothering them at all. They did not ignore him, neither did they reject or push him away. The Suzuhara household simply let him be. He sat, knees drawn to his chest, bowl of stew half-emptied, barely responding to them, and they continued to smile. A frown began to manifest; the more they laughed and seemed to enjoy life in the world he had broken, the more the discomfort grew. _Why can't they just be like Asuka?_  
他们为何如此友善？为何不能像船上的人那样？他按住膝盖上包扎的部位，伤口隐隐作痛。家中成员继续和善地分享各自的日子和活动，仿佛他的存在丝毫没有打扰到他们。他们既没有忽视他，也没有排斥或推开他。铃原家只是任由他待着。他蜷缩着双腿坐着，碗里的炖菜只吃了一半，几乎不回应他们，而他们依旧面带微笑。眉头渐渐紧锁；他们越是笑得开怀，似乎越是享受这个被他破坏的世界中的生活，那种不适感就越发强烈。为何他们不能像明日香那样？

The house was small and inviting; the eldest Suzuhara spoke gently and amiably, Hikari's child was chubby and healthy. Why were they happy in the planet he had destroyed? _If I do nothing, everyone suffers. If I do something, everyone suffers._ The voices quieted down eventually; the small entourage diminished until naught but Toji, Hikari, their child and the elder man remained. The babe began to wail; he saw the former Class Rep console it with a grin, saw Toji hug her and try to offer a helping hand. His grip on the soft fabric increased; why was he in the house, again?  
房子虽小却温馨宜人；铃原家长子语气温和亲切，光的孩子胖乎乎、健健康康。为何他们在自己毁灭的星球上如此幸福？若我无所作为，众人受苦。若我有所行动，众人亦受苦。那些声音最终平息下来；一行人逐渐减少，最后只剩下铃原夫妇、他们的孩子和那位长者。婴儿开始啼哭；他看见前班长带着微笑安抚它，看见铃原拥抱着她，试图伸出援手。他紧握着柔软的布料；为何自己又回到了这间屋子？

At some point in the day Toji redressed the cut and commented how it was healing nicely. Memories of seeing the wound grow increasingly red and purple bled into his brain, flashes of the cage he was held in became clear; a hand pulling his arm along, forcing him to move. When had he taken off the Plug Suit? At long last, the memory of red hands curling metal rings on his wrists resurfaced. He had no recollection of the pain or when, exactly, the cut had been produced.  
某天，Toji 重新包扎了伤口，并称赞它愈合得很好。目睹伤口逐渐变得红紫的记忆涌入脑海，他被囚禁的笼子的画面变得清晰起来；一只手拽着他的手臂，强迫他移动。他何时脱下了插入栓服？终于，记忆中红色双手缠绕在他手腕上的金属环的画面重新浮现。他记不起疼痛的感觉，也不记得伤口究竟是何时造成的。

Shinji dabbed at his eyes; he had been frowning at the floor for way too long. He noticed Hikari and Toji sitting by the table, with Hikari rocking the baby gently on her lap as the child giggled and gurgled with joy. His eyebrow twitched; had they told him the child's name, already?  
真嗣轻拭双眼，他已经对着地板皱眉太久了。他注意到 Hikari 和 Toji 坐在桌旁，Hikari 轻摇着膝上的婴儿，孩子咯咯笑着，发出欢快的咕噜声。他的眉头不由一跳；他们已经告诉他孩子的名字了吗？

"Come on, Tsubame, be nice to your Mama's apron, now," Hikari said as the child tugged at the fabric. "I think she's about to arrive. We should let them go and take a walk, Toji. It might be good. Oh, is Ikari wearing..?"  
“来吧，燕，对妈妈的围裙温柔点。”光一边说，一边轻轻拉开孩子拽着布料的手。“我想她快到了。我们该让他们走，去散个步，东治。或许不错。哦，真嗣他穿的是……？”

"Oh, yeah. You told me about that. I'll be right back," he heard the former jock say as he sprinted towards one of the rooms. He was left alone with Hikari and the baby; every few seconds the young woman would address with a sympathetic, melancholic glance. It was the same look the others in the village had given the Third Child; there was hardly any pity in it. Their eyes irked him, their smiles angered him; the sound of the baby being so alive almost forced him to rise and escape the house.  
“哦，对。你跟我说过这事。我马上回来。”他听到前运动员这么说，随即朝其中一个房间冲去。留下他和光以及婴儿独处；每隔几秒，年轻女子就会投来同情而忧郁的目光。这和村里其他人看第三适格者的眼神如出一辙；几乎没有怜悯。他们的目光让他不适，笑容令他恼火；婴儿如此鲜活的声响几乎迫使他起身逃离这屋子。

"I know it must be pretty hard for you, right now, Shinji," Hikari told him, managing to draw his half-frown to her. "That's a nice jacket you have there."  
“我知道你现在一定很难受，真嗣，”光子对他说，成功地让他那半皱的眉头转向了她。“你那件夹克挺好看的。”

Realizing his hands were still gripping the sleeves with vehemence, Shinji recalled to whom exactly the garment belonged. _She said I could keep it, though. Did she mean it?_ "Thank you, Hokari." He had eaten slowly, forcing the food into his mouth despite not being hungry at all; he was to eat and take care of himself. He was to survive, and struggle, whatever that meant. "It's not mine," he confessed quietly. "At least, I don't know if it is."  
意识到自己的双手仍紧紧抓着那袖子，真嗣想起了这件衣服的主人究竟是谁。她说我可以留着它，不过。她是认真的吗？“谢谢你，光里。”他慢慢地吃着，尽管一点也不饿，还是强迫自己把食物塞进嘴里；他必须吃东西，照顾好自己。他得活下去，挣扎着，无论那意味着什么。“这不是我的，”他轻声坦白道，“至少，我不知道它是不是。”

At the very least, he had had made certain no food stains had tarnished the red and white cloth.  
至少，他确保了红白布料上没有留下任何食物污渍。

"We wouldn't want it to get ruined, would we?" Toji's voice rang from afar; he carried a bundle of black and white clothes, which he placed next to him with the same patient, gentle smile every other person drove his way. The discomfort blossomed into anger. "Try that on, it's some of my old stuff," clarified the village doctor with a smirk. "Trust me, they're comfortable and clean."  
“我们可不想它被毁了，对吧？”东治的声音从远处传来；他拿着一捆黑白相间的衣服，带着和其他人对待他时一样的耐心和温柔的微笑，放在了他旁边。这种不适逐渐变成了愤怒。“试试这个，是我的一些旧衣服，”村医带着一丝戏谑解释道，“相信我，它们既舒适又干净。”

He did as he was told; Shinji walked over to the small restroom, changed into the track suit and returned to sit in the same corner, with the pants provided by him and Asuka's jacket neatly folded beside him. Neither member of the Suzuhara household tried to speak with him further; he remained there, immobile, anger rising in his chest, until the child screamed out its hunger and managed to distract him.  
他照做了；真嗣走到小休息室，换上运动服，回到同一个角落坐下，旁边整齐地放着铃原家提供的裤子和明日香的外套。铃原家的任何成员都没有再试图与他交谈；他就那样一动不动地坐在那里，胸中的怒火逐渐升腾，直到婴儿饥饿的哭声响起，才勉强分散了他的注意力。

"What's," he started, licking his lips and realizing his throat was dry. When had he last had water? "What's the name of the baby?"  
“什，”他开口道，舔了舔嘴唇，意识到喉咙干涩。他上次喝水是什么时候？“宝宝的名字是什么？”

"Tsubame." “燕。”

His eyes drifted to the familiar voice; Shinji's eyes widened instantly. Rei Q was standing by the door, dirt and grime clinging to the boots and cloak she wore on top of the black plugsuit, cheeks slightly flushed and crimson eyes staring back at him. Ayanami's eyes, and at the same time, not her eyes at all. Familiarity shone in her gaze.  
他的目光飘向那熟悉的声音；真嗣的眼睛立刻睁大了。丽 Q 站在门口，泥土和污垢粘附在她所穿的黑色插入栓服外的靴子和斗篷上，双颊微微泛红，赤红的眼眸回望着他。那是绫波的眼睛，却又完全不是她的眼睛。熟悉的光芒在她眼中闪烁。

"Ikari-kun," she greeted with a hesitant smile. Again, the bitterness coiled through his insides; he could not stand their kindness any longer. "I am glad to see you."  
"碇君，"她带着犹豫的微笑打招呼。又一次，苦涩在他内心盘旋；他再也无法忍受他们的善意了。"很高兴见到你。"

He stood abruptly, hands curled into fists, and marched out of the house without another word, holding nothing but the redhead's jacket in between his fists. It was too much; their gentle voices, the baby's cries, the sound of dogs, cats, birds, the smell of fresh water and moist earth. He detested how neither Hikari nor Toji said a word and simply allowed him to storm out in a haste, detested how as he passed by Rei, she immediately began to trail behind him. The strides became more hurried; he had no clue where he was or where he was going, any place without people or nice little smiles directed his way would suffice.  
他突然站起身，双手紧握成拳，一言不发地冲出房子，手中只攥着红发女孩的夹克。这一切太过分了；他们温柔的声音，婴儿的哭声，狗、猫、鸟的叫声，新鲜的水和湿润泥土的气味。他憎恨光和东治一言不发，任由他匆忙离开，憎恨当他经过丽时，她立刻开始跟在他身后。他的步伐越来越快；他不知道自己在哪里，要去哪里，任何没有人群和那些友好微笑的地方都行。

A prisoner, was he? Allowed to wander around, leave when he pleased with not a word or so much as a glare while he basically began to sprint, desperate to get away. How was he a prisoner if everybody kept smiling at him like there was nothing wrong? He pushed past strangers who aside from an initial annoyed glance spared him nothing more than those friendly little grins. His head bowed until it was almost touching his chin. Something caught his attention as he neared the remains of a large building where NERV's logo was barely recognizable. The glistening reflection of the sun crashing against the battered ruins drew his attention; he could not recall ever seeing the ocean so blue.  
一个囚犯，是吗？却能自由游荡，随心所欲地离开，连一句责备或一个怒视都没有，仿佛他开始狂奔、急切逃离时，一切都理所当然。如果每个人都对他微笑，仿佛一切正常，他又怎算得上囚犯？他推开路人，除了最初的不悦一瞥，他们只回以友好的浅笑。他低头几乎触到下巴。当他走近那座残破的大楼，NERV 的标志已难以辨认时，某样东西吸引了他的注意。阳光在破败废墟上的闪耀反射令他驻足；他记不清曾见过如此湛蓝的大海。

Gentle waves crashed against the concrete, ocean breeze welcomed with along with the smell of saltwater, the horizon stretched before him, blue disappearing and turning into crimson after a few miles. The red-covered moon reflected in the sea, as though not willing to let him forget for a single second about his actions. He heard the girl's steps approach him after a few minutes of staring into the water. His gaze shifted to the jacket curled up in his fist; why was he even bothering to carry it anywhere? _There's no point. There's nothing I can do. How can I pay a penance against everybody in the world?_ He turned back to the building and sat on the hard surface of the largest room, opting to stare at a wall and not the water.  
轻柔的波浪拍打着混凝土，海风携着咸湿的气息迎面而来，地平线在他眼前延伸，蓝色在几英里后渐变为深红。被红光笼罩的月亮映在海面上，仿佛不愿让他片刻忘记自己的所作所为。他凝视着水面，几分钟后听到了女孩走近的脚步声。他的目光转向紧握在手中的夹克；为何还要费心带着它四处走动？毫无意义。我无能为力。我该如何向全世界赎罪？他转身面向建筑，坐在最大房间的坚硬地面上，选择凝视墙壁而非海水。

The disease waned with every passing hour, but the memories and the weight of his actions felt like a sickness much more horrendous than any fever or infection. Not even trying to close off his brain and self into shock had worked; the promise of oblivion after starving himself had been hastily removed with Asuka's demands. _I really don't see why I should live on only because she tells me to. Every time I do something somebody gets hurts, or dies._ Kaworu's smile before the choker exploded ran through his mind.  
疾病随着时间的流逝逐渐消退，但记忆和他行为的沉重感却如同一种比任何高烧或感染都更为可怕的疾病。甚至试图将自己封闭在震惊中也无济于事；在自我饥饿后对遗忘的承诺，因明日香的要求而仓促收回。我真的不明白，为什么仅仅因为她让我活下去，我就应该继续生存。每次我有所行动，总会有人受伤或死去。卡罗尔在项圈爆炸前的那抹微笑，在他脑海中反复闪现。

Shinji shook his head to clear it of the memory, yet despite his best efforts, the nausea manifested. The relaxed and amiable expressions came next; driving the desire to retch away for the moment, and instead filling his stomach with bitter resentment. Towards himself, towards his father, towards his own foolishness and ignorance, towards those happy women, men and children; it became stifling as he held onto the red fabric and did his best effort to not rip it to shreds.  
碇真嗣摇了摇头，试图驱散那段记忆，尽管他竭尽全力，恶心感还是涌了上来。接着是那些轻松友好的表情；暂时驱散了呕吐的冲动，取而代之的是满腹的苦涩怨恨。对自己，对父亲，对自己的愚蠢和无知，对那些快乐的女人、男人和孩子；当他紧抓着那块红布，尽力不将其撕成碎片时，这种感觉变得令人窒息。

"Ikari-kun," Rei's voice echoed through the empty hall. "I heard you were unwell. Are you faring better?"  
"碇君，" 绫的声音在空荡的大厅中回响，"我听说你不舒服。现在好些了吗？"

_Why does that matter?_ Clenching and unclenching the bandaged hand was evidence enough; the pain was also becoming less scalding as time went by. He was not shaking, nor was he sweating and shivering simultaneously. Why was it than the pain in his chest never abated, then? "I'm fine," he responded, drawing his knees into his chest and hugging them along with the jacket. "I was sick, but I'm feeling better now."  
那有什么关系？紧握和松开那只包扎着的手已经足够说明问题；随着时间的推移，疼痛也不再那么灼热。他没有颤抖，也没有同时出汗和发抖。那么，为什么胸口的疼痛从未减轻呢？“我没事，”他回答道，将膝盖抱入胸前，连同夹克一起拥抱着。“我生病了，但现在感觉好多了。”

Was he feeling better, though? With every passing second the anger pulsed along with his heartbeat and spread over him like the infection had some days before. _What the hell is this punishment of mine supposed to be?_ The SDAT lay forgotten, resting beside the dictionary; there was no possibility of just listening to the tapes and escaping. He had no clue of where he was, or where he had run to, Shinji honestly had no idea of how to return to either the Suzuhara household or the house where Asuka apparently lived.  
然而，他真的感觉好些了吗？每一秒过去，愤怒都随着心跳涌动，像几天前的感染一样蔓延全身。这到底算是什么惩罚？SDAT 播放器被遗忘在一旁，旁边是字典；听磁带逃避现实已无可能。他不知道自己在哪里，也不知道逃到了哪里，真治真的不知道如何回到铃原家或显然是明日香住的房子。

"Why did you fall ill?" Rei inquired next; a backward glance revealed she was a good ten feet away from him. Her gaze was filled with what he could only describe as childish curiosity and wonder. "I have noticed some villagers fall sick at times. Were you soaked by the rain?"  
"你为什么会生病？" 丽接着问道；一个回眸显示她与他相距足有十尺。她的目光中充满了孩子般的好奇与惊奇。"我注意到有些村民偶尔会生病。你是被雨淋湿了吗？"

"No," Shinji proclaimed through gritted teeth. He could not remember at which point his body had begun to throb, or when the fevers had first manifested. His eyes drifted to the bandages, and to the memories of the cell where Asuka had condemned him to live on. "I got an infection, and a fever."  
"没有，" 真嗣咬牙切齿地说。他不记得身体是从何时开始疼痛，或是发烧是从何时开始的。他的目光飘向绷带，以及那个阿斯卡将他囚禁其中的牢房的记忆。"我感染了，还发烧了。"

"Oh." Quiet footsteps approached him, yet he refused to turn his head again. "I am glad to hear that, Ikari-kun."  
"哦。" 轻柔的脚步声向他靠近，但他拒绝再次转头。"听到你这么说，我很高兴，碇君。"

Something cracked or broke; the pressure in his chest became unbearable.  
有什么东西断裂了；他胸中的压力变得难以承受。

"Why?" he asked, bitterness dripping off his tone.  
“为什么？”他问道，语气中带着苦涩。

"Hm?" The girl drew closer still, yet was still a good five feet away. "Why what, Ikari-kun?"  
“嗯？”女孩又靠近了一些，但仍保持着五英尺的距离。“什么为什么，碇君？”

"Why are you glad?" His erratic breathing increased, the frown turned into a glare, which he turned to Rei, incensed. "Why are you glad I'm better? You barely even know me. Why are people glad? Why are they happy, here?" He curled even tighter into himself. "Why are they all _smiling_ at me! Don't they know what I did?"  
"你为什么高兴？" 他急促的呼吸加剧，眉头紧锁变成了怒视，转向丽，愤怒不已。"为什么你为我好转而高兴？你几乎不认识我。为什么人们会高兴？为什么他们在这里开心？" 他更加蜷缩成一团。"为什么他们都在对我笑！他们不知道我做了什么吗？"

Rei titled her head to the side. "What you did? Do you mean Third Impact?"  
丽侧过头。"你做了什么？你是说第三次冲击吗？"

"Yes! Of course I mean Third Impact!" he half-yelled, half sobbed; the anger mingled with agony and guilt, the simple task of articulating words, which had eluded him for days on end, now became stifling. "I'm the reason everything in this world is broken! How come they're all smiling?! How come they're smiling at me?!"  
"是的！当然是指第三次冲击！" 他半喊半泣；愤怒与痛苦和愧疚交织，简单表达话语的任务，这些天来一直逃避他，现在变得令人窒息。"我是这个世界一切破碎的原因！为什么他们都在笑？！为什么他们对我笑？！"

"Why would they not?" rebuked the Ayanami clone, forcing Shinji's eyes to widen in shock. "I am learning many things about this world," she revealed, and showed Shinji the brownish stains in her hands. "It would seem planting rice is a rather difficult task. It would also seem that I… truly know very little of everything that was not my purpose. I may not know much, but I know I do not dislike you, Ikari-kun. I do not believe anyone here does, either."  
"他们为什么不呢？"绫波零的克隆体反驳道，迫使真嗣的眼睛因震惊而睁大。"我正在学习这个世界的许多事情，"她透露，并向真嗣展示了她手上的棕色污渍。"看来种稻米是一项相当困难的任务。似乎我也……对非我使命之外的一切知之甚少。我可能懂得不多，但我知道我不讨厌你，碇君。我相信这里也没有人讨厌你。"

Feeling increasingly frustrated, Shinji climbed to his feet and threw the jacket he had been protecting so long to the ground. "That's exactly it! Nobody should like me! I don't want anyone to smile at me! I don't want anyone to look at me, or talk to me! I don't want anything!"  
感到越来越沮丧，真嗣站起身来，将他保护了很久的夹克扔到地上。"正是如此！没有人应该喜欢我！我不希望任何人对我微笑！我不希望任何人看着我，或与我交谈！我什么都不想要！"

He panted, feeling the weariness of whatever remained of the disease burn through his stiff muscles as they complained at the abrupt movement. The wound around his wrist wailed in discontent while his fists continued to tighten and glared at the ground. A few more inches to the left, and Asuka's jacket would have been most likely been ruined by a puddle of dirty water lying next to it. "Every time, every single I try to do something, I end up messing it up," added the Third Child in a desperate whisper. "So I should just not do anything at all."  
他喘着粗气，感受到疾病残余的疲惫如火般灼烧着僵硬的肌肉，它们因突如其来的动作而发出抗议。手腕上的伤口不满地呻吟着，而他的拳头继续紧握，怒视着地面。再往左几英寸，明日香的外套很可能就会被旁边的一滩脏水毁掉。"每次，我每次尝试做点什么，结果总是搞砸，"第三适格者绝望地低语道，"所以我应该干脆什么都不做。"

The silence that followed soon after was only interrupted by the sound of the sea, of birds flying by, and by Shinji's own irregular breathing. Despite voicing out his anger and frustration, there was no unburdening in his rib cage, his heart and mind both felt constricted and broken to pieces. _I almost ruined Asuka's jacket, and for what?_ The wrath vanished far swifter than it had arrived, leaving nothing but more helplessness and exhaustion behind. It was so tiring, everything was so overbearingly exhausting.  
随之而来的沉默很快被海浪声、飞鸟掠过的声音以及真嗣自己不规则的呼吸声打破。尽管发泄了愤怒和沮丧，他的胸腔里并没有感到释然，心和思绪都感到紧缩和破碎。我差点毁了明日香的外套，为了什么？怒火消散得比来时更快，留下的只有更多的无助和疲惫。一切都太累了，每件事都让人难以承受地疲惫。

"Do you believe doing nothing will help improve your state of mind?" Rei said, devoid of any malice. Her tone was inquisitive at best. "If that is the case, perhaps doing nothing is the proper course."  
“你认为什么都不做会有助于改善你的心态吗？”绫波说，不带任何恶意。她的语气最多只是好奇。“如果是这样的话，或许什么都不做才是正确的选择。”

_If that came from Asuka, it would've been terribly sarcastic,_ he mused, shaking his head. "I wish it were so easy," _My punishment must be more severe. And what better punishment than seeing all those people smile at me?_ "I can't. I'm not allowed to just do nothing."  
如果这话出自明日香，那必定是极尽讽刺之能事，他暗自思忖，摇了摇头。“我倒希望如此简单，”我的惩罚想必更为严酷。还有什么比看到那些人对我微笑更严厉的惩罚呢？“我做不到。我不能就这样无所事事。”

Rei blinked in surprise. "And who is denying you this, Ikari-kun?"  
丽惊讶地眨了眨眼。“谁在否认你这个，一尉君？”

_Asuka,_ his mind provided with ease, and just as the name surfaced, so did the self-disgust. Whatever her reasons, Asuka had done nothing short of ensuring he was still alive, to his own dismay. _Myself. I say I want to die, but it terrifies me. I just don't know. I don't want to live._ "I'm a prisoner." He revealed bitterly.  
明日香，他的脑海轻易地浮现出这个名字，随之而来的还有自我厌恶。无论她的理由是什么，明日香所做的不过是确保他还活着，尽管这让他自己感到沮丧。我自己。我说我想死，但这让我害怕。我只是不知道。我不想活了。“我是个囚犯。”他苦涩地坦白道。

"No, you're not." “不，你不是。”

Both teens turned to Toji, who was leaning on one of the broken down walls, with the lopsided smile he had been wearing all morning dancing on his lips. "Nobody here thinks you're a prisoner. It might be some stupid formality Wille pushed into Shikinami, but to us, you're just Ikari. We're glad to have you here."  
两个少年转向了冬二，他正倚在一堵破墙边，嘴角挂着一早上都未曾消失的歪斜微笑。“这里没人认为你是囚犯。可能是 Wille 强加给式波的一些愚蠢形式，但对我们来说，你就是碇。我们很高兴你能在这里。”

"Why?" demanded the boy a second time. "Why would you be happy to have me here?! Don't you know wh-"  
“为什么？”男孩再次质问。“为什么你会高兴我在这里？！你难道不知道……”

"Third Impact, or Near Third Impact, however they call it, brought a lot of terrible things," the doctor interjected. "But I'd be lying to you if I said it's been all bad or something. Lots of incredible things have happened, as well." He motioned behind him, where the village was located. "We've persevered, despite the circumstances. I'm married, and have a beautiful child. Hell, Kensuke's our Commander! Remember him?" Shinji nodded absently, recalling the bespectacled boy. "You'll probably meet him soon, anyway. He'll also be happy to see you, believe or not."  
“第三次冲击，或者说是接近第三次冲击，不管他们怎么称呼，带来了许多可怕的事情，”医生插话道。“但如果我说这一切都是坏事，那我就是在骗你。许多不可思议的事情也发生了。”他指了指身后的村庄。“尽管环境恶劣，我们还是坚持了下来。我结婚了，有了一个漂亮的孩子。甚至，剑介成了我们的指挥官！记得他吗？”真嗣心不在焉地点了点头，想起了那个戴眼镜的男孩。“不管怎样，你很快就会见到他。他也会很高兴见到你的，信不信由你。”

Shinji shook his head, eyes darting to the garment thrown on the ground. It would seem Asuka was the only one in the village who made any sense in her behavior towards him. "You shouldn't waste time on me," whispered the male pilot. She never smiled at him; the redhead never smiled at all, and of course, it was due to him. "After what I've done, I haven't done anything to deserve this… kindness."  
真嗣摇了摇头，目光飘向扔在地上的衣物。看来在这个村子里，只有明日香对他的态度还算正常。“你不该在我身上浪费时间。”少年飞行员低声说道。她从未对他笑过；红发女孩从不展露笑容，当然，这都是因为他。“在我做了那些事后，我不配得到这样的……善意。”

Regardless of his best efforts to be rid of those happy grins, Shinji's words had the opposite effect on Toji; the man's smile widened, brown eyes softening in relief. "It's nice to see you more lucid, Ikari. I'm really glad you're slowly getting better." In a vast contrast to the first time he had seen Shinji, completely catatonic and unresponsive, the boy was now talking without stammering half as much, his eyes were more alive, even if it was anger what shone in his gaze. "Come on, I'll take you back after I change those bandages. Hikari and Tsubame send their love. You know the way back to the house, right, Rei? Tsuba can't wait to play with you!"  
尽管竭尽全力想摆脱那些愉快的笑容，但真嗣的话却产生了相反的效果；东治的笑容更加灿烂，棕色的眼睛因宽慰而柔和。“能看到你更清醒真是太好了，真嗣。我真的很高兴你正在慢慢好转。”与第一次见到真嗣时完全木讷无反应的状态截然不同，现在他讲话不再那么结巴，眼神也更加有生气，尽管其中闪烁的是愤怒。“来吧，我给你换完绷带就带你回去。光和燕都向你问好。你知道回房的路吧，绫波？燕已经迫不及待想和你玩了！”

"Oh, yes, Tsuba-kun," the blue-haired girl began to walk away, not before shifting to gaze at the Third Child and give him yet another unearned smile. "It was nice to see you, Ikari-kun. I hope your health continues to improve. I was very glad to have spent time you you, today. I will be in the Suzuhara household."  
“哦，是的，燕君，”蓝发女孩开始离开，临走前转向第三适格者，再次给了他一个不应得的微笑。“很高兴见到你，真嗣君。希望你的健康继续好转。今天能和你共度时光，我感到非常高兴。我会去铃原家。”

Toji chuckled. "I think you're gonna see a lot more of him in the coming days," he commented as Rei made her way back. Some unnamed burden on his shoulders slackened somewhat; Ikari was at least present, able to articulate sentences, and moving more normally than before. "Let's leave the fields for some other day. Time to get you back."  
冬二轻声笑道：“我想接下来几天你会经常见到他的。”他看着丽走回来，肩上某种无形的重担似乎稍稍减轻了些；至少真嗣在场，能说出连贯的句子，行动也比之前自然多了。“改天再来这里吧。现在该送你回去了。”

Irresolute of what to do and feeling the edges of his mind begin to close off again, he allowed himself to be led back, not before picking up the jacket from the floor. He folded it as neatly as possible, glad to see no concerning dirt marks on the white and red cloth, and trailed behind Toji a few seconds afterwards. He would have forgotten the jacket altogether, had the man not pointed at it with a knowing smirk before he began walking away. _Why am I following him? Why am I doing anything? Why didn't I just stay there? Why was Rei so nice to me, just now?_  
犹豫不决该做什么，感觉到自己的思绪边缘又开始封闭起来，他任由自己被带回，临走前还不忘从地上捡起外套。他尽可能整齐地叠好它，庆幸在红白相间的布料上没有看到令人担忧的污渍，几秒钟后跟在东治后面。如果不是那人带着一丝得意的笑意指了指外套后转身离开，他差点就完全忘记了这件外套。我为什么要跟着他？我为什么要做这些？我为什么不就留在那里？为什么丽刚才对我那么好？

Unlike when arriving at the ruins, this time Shinji's mind was able to memorize certain paths, the overall appearance of the village; the features of the villagers molded from shadows with smiles to actual humans. The scents of oil, dirt, sweat and food being prepared, the feeling of loose earth and stone under his feet, the gush of the wind, or the different weight and fabric of the track suit he had been given provided; he could process most of these sensations. Some time had passed since the sight of blood all over and the grimy remains of Kaworu had washed over, and the fatigue born out of the fever had allowed him two nights of a dreamless slumber.  
与初抵废墟时不同，这次真嗣的脑海中能记住某些路径，村庄的整体样貌；村民们从带着微笑的阴影塑像逐渐变为真实的人。油、泥土、汗水和正在烹制的食物的气味，脚下松散的泥土与石块的触感，风的涌动，或是他被赋予的运动服的不同重量与面料——他能够处理这些大部分的感觉。自满眼血迹和卡罗尔肮脏遗骸的景象冲击以来，已过去一段时间，高烧带来的疲惫让他得以享受两晚无梦的安眠。

The walk back to Toji's house revealed just how much distance he had covered in what had felt like a fleeting dash to escape. Fear began to bubble in his gut and chest; if he was anchored to reality, after all, nothing would protect him from the memories.  
返回冬二家的路上，他才意识到自己为了逃离那短暂却急促的冲刺，究竟走了多远。恐惧开始在腹部和胸腔中翻涌；毕竟，如果他真的被现实所束缚，那么没有任何东西能保护他免受那些记忆的侵扰。

When he returned to the Suzuhara household, Shinji was once again greeted by most of the family. He tried his best to smile back but was thoroughly unable, no matter how fervently he forced a smirk to manifest. The Third Child spoke a bit more with Rei, felt a strange sense of relief upon watching her brimming with curiosity, and sat at the table instead of in the corner to have the wound reinspected.  
当他回到铃原家时，再次受到了大部分家人的欢迎。他尽力尝试微笑回应，但无论如何努力，都无法真正展露笑容。第三适格者与绫波聊了一会儿，看到她充满好奇心的样子，心中涌起一种奇怪的宽慰感，于是他坐在桌边而非角落，让伤口再次接受检查。

"By the looks of it, we won't be needing the bandages in another day." His eyes drifted to the wound for what felt like the first time, glancing at the shape and length of the cut. It began just above his wrist bone and stretched all the way down to the underside of his forearm. It was not deep, or at least had not been at the beginning; the infection had broadened the edges and still, after some days of being thoroughly washed and redressed, was a tad swollen. He hissed when the antiseptic was applied.  
看样子，我们明天就不需要绷带了。他的目光似乎是第一次落到伤口上，打量着那条切口的形状和长度。它起始于腕骨上方，一直延伸到前臂内侧。伤口并不深，或者至少起初并不深；感染使得边缘变得宽阔，尽管经过几天的彻底清洗和重新包扎，仍有轻微的肿胀。当消毒剂涂抹上去时，他不禁倒吸了一口气。

"I know it stings, we'll be done soon," Toji mentioned with a chuckle. "It's healing quite well, Ikari. We're done. Do you want to go back, now?"  
"我知道这有点疼，我们很快就结束了，" 冬二带着一丝笑意说道。"伤口愈合得很好，碇。我们做完了。你现在想回去吗？"

_Do I have a choice?_ He wondered, but remembered Suzuhara himself had told him nobody in the village saw him as a prisoner, regardless of the fact that he was, indeed, the one at fault for destroying everything. In all fairness, Asuka had not once mentioned if she minded or cared if he returned. "Yeah," he agreed hesitantly, eyes drawing to the jacket resting by the table. "I guess."  
我有选择吗？他心想，但记起铃原自己也曾告诉他，村里没有人把他当作囚犯看待，尽管事实上他确实是毁掉一切的罪魁祸首。平心而论，明日香从未提及过她是否介意或关心他回去。"嗯，"他犹豫地同意了，目光转向桌旁的那件夹克。"我想是的。"

"I'm telling you, she doesn't hate you." A hand squeezed Shinji's right shoulder. "Shikinami gave you that jacket, didn't she? I've known her for fourteen years. She's never given anybody _anything_."  
"我告诉你，她并不恨你。" 一只手紧握住真嗣的右肩。"式波给了你那件夹克，不是吗？我认识她十四年了。她从未给过任何人任何东西。"

Howver comforting the statement was supposed to be, it only made Shinji want to curl into a ball and die on the floor, far away from where her resentful eye could reach. _Fourteen years. Fourteen years about a life I know nothing about. Fourteen years living with whatever I did to her. Whatever Father did to her with my hands. Inaction. Inaction, Shinji._ "How can I ever even," he started, staring at his palms. "I don't know what to do."  
尽管这句话本意是安慰，却只让真嗣想蜷缩成一团，死在远离她怨恨目光的地板上。十四年。关于我一无所知的生活，十四年。与我所做的一切共度十四年。无论父亲用我的双手对她做了什么。无所作为。无所作为，真嗣。“我该如何是好，”他盯着掌心，喃喃自语，“我不知道该做什么。”

Toji shared a knowing smirk with Hikari, who gently lay a small covered bowl on the table. "Here, Ikari-kun. There's not that much to go around, but here are some fresh ingredients Father got today. Maybe you should try cooking something for her," offered the young woman. Asuka's 'condition' was well known, but it would most definitely not hurt to make the female feel some sort of familiarity. They both recalled her face while eating those Bentos in school, after all. "I'm sure she'd like that."  
冬二与光交换了一个心领神会的微笑，光轻轻将一个盖着的小碗放在桌上。“给，碇君。虽然不多，但这是父亲今天新买的食材。也许你可以试着为她做点什么，”年轻女子提议道。明日香的情况众所周知，但让她感受到些许熟悉感肯定无伤大雅。毕竟，他们都记得她在学校吃便当时的表情。“我相信她会喜欢的。”

"_You should just go and lose someone important to you, too!"_  
"你应该也去失去一个对你重要的人！"

She paused the video feed, glaring at the dented object with renewed irritation. This was the fifth time she had seen the damn video in a row after charging the old phone. Five times, already. Why did hearing those stupid little words made her chest shudder? The small admission meant nothing, not after fourteen years, and yet it bled a different type of remorse and bitterness, not at all the anger and hollowness she had gotten so accustomed to. _Stop this crap, stop it._ The Major demanded, baring her teeth as the eye underneath the eyepatch shone bright blue. _So what, that tantrum suddenly solves everything, huh? That's it. Stop. Stop._ She remembered the sight of him after the Impact had been avoided, the way he could not even stand or move on his own. Why had she even bothered to take him?  
她暂停了视频，对着那个凹陷的物体再次感到恼火。这是她充电旧手机后连续看的第五遍了。已经五次了。为什么听到那些愚蠢的小词会让她的胸口颤抖？这个小承认在十四年后毫无意义，然而它却流露出一种不同类型的悔恨和苦涩，完全不是她习惯的愤怒和空虚。别再这样了，别再这样了。少校咬牙切齿，眼罩下的眼睛闪着明亮的蓝光。那又怎样，突然发脾气就能解决一切吗？就这样。停。停。她记得在避免冲击后看到他的样子，他甚至无法站立或自行移动。她为什么要费心带他走？

"What, and make Nerv's plans easier to accomplish by bringing them their favorite little catalyst for destruction?" she asked the empty house the perpetual frown wrinkling her features. "Or let him die like he wanted to, die easy. No questions asked, just let him rot in his own inadequacy." Hours and hours had gone by, hours in which the batteries of her WonderSwan had died, and she had felt too lazy to scavenge for some extras in the many boxes littered around the house.  
“什么，难道要让他们最钟爱的小小毁灭催化剂更易得手，从而让 NERV 的计划更顺利实施吗？”她对着空荡荡的房子发问，眉头紧锁成了永恒的皱褶。“还是让他如愿以偿地死去，轻松地死。不问任何问题，任由他在自己的无能中腐烂。”时间一小时一小时地流逝，她的 WonderSwan 电池耗尽，而她又懒得在屋内散落各处的箱子里翻找备用电池。

She had promised to punish him, or more accurately, to let life punish him until such point that she was satisfied. And what would satisfy her? Why did she feel unease at the thought of him dying, after having considered him dead for over fourteen years? _Your punishment must be more severe, brat._ For a while, the pilot had thought seeing or causing Shinji pain would suffice. It made her sick instead. Her finger was about to press play for a sixth time; it halted just centimeters away from the screen. _Stop. This is foolish, it's a waste. Stop pretending like you actually give a damn. Stop!_  
她曾承诺要惩罚他，或者更确切地说，让生活去惩罚他，直到她感到满意为止。而什么才能让她满意呢？为什么在认为他已经死了超过十四年后，一想到他会死去，她会感到不安呢？你的惩罚必须更严厉，小鬼。有一阵子，驾驶员以为看到或造成真嗣痛苦就足够了。但这反而让她感到恶心。她的手指即将第六次按下播放键；却在离屏幕仅几厘米处停住了。停下来。这是愚蠢的，是浪费。别再假装你真的在乎了。停下来！

The cellphone was hurled against the nearest wall; the state of it was already so deplorable that it broke into several pieces after she used all of her strength to hurl it as far away from her as possible. Standing from the one available bed in a fluid motion, Asuka forced herself to not look at the broken pieces lying on the floor as she made her way to the bathroom.  
手机被猛地掷向最近的墙壁；它的状态本已糟糕透顶，在她用尽全力将其尽可能远地抛离自己后，终于碎成了几块。流畅地从唯一的一张床上起身，明日香强迫自己不去看地板上散落的碎片，径直走向浴室。

_Good riddance,_ she pondered, ignoring the stab of agony that tightened around her heart and squeezed. _It was getting ridiculous. You're alone, Asuka. Never forget that, never, ever. You're alone. That Shinji… is no longer Baka-Shinji._ Having done little else than lay around playing her games throughout the better part of the day, just as the sun had begun to set, the Second Child's attention had focused on the now ruined little device. The result of his actions, however heroic in nature, had probably broken him beyond repair or possibility of return, already. _He's weak, after all. Always was, and now on top of it all, he's broken._  
终于解脱了，她思忖着，无视那紧缩心脏的剧痛。这已经荒谬至极。你孤身一人，明日香。永远不要忘记，永远，永远。你孤身一人。那个真嗣……不再是笨蛋真嗣了。一整天除了躺着玩她的游戏外几乎无所事事，就在太阳开始西沉时，第二适格者的注意力集中在了这个如今已毁坏的小装置上。尽管他的行为本质上是英勇的，但很可能已经让他彻底崩溃，无法修复或回归。毕竟，他一直都很软弱，现在更是雪上加霜，彻底破碎了。

The Entry Plug lay just outside the house; Asuka paused and stared at it for a long time. That Plug was most likely to be her coffin in the near future; the thought was strangely reassuring. She had been going about from one morning to the next, surviving, existing, but not truly living for so long, that the thought of a life beyond her next mission had become nonexistent.  
插入栓就躺在屋外；明日香停下脚步，久久凝视着它。那个插入栓很可能在不久的将来成为她的棺材；这个想法出奇地令人安心。她日复一日地奔波，生存，存在，却从未真正活过，以至于对超越下一次任务的生活已经不复存在。

And yet, the taste and smell of chamomile had reminded her of days past, of a small apartment and a penguin. For a fleeting moment in that lonesome existence she had felt like something akin to a human, to the extent that she had taken Rei's place as the pilot of Unit 03, in an attempt to have the First Child make her little dinner with the Commander and his bratty son. _Yeah, and look where that got you,_ her hand traced the eyepatch's surface. A day in which she had tried to so something other than exist for her given purpose had taught her how foolish it had all been.  
然而，洋甘菊的味道和香气让她想起了过去的时光，想起了一个小公寓和一只企鹅。在那孤独的生活中，有那么一瞬，她感觉自己近乎像个普通人，甚至接替了丽的位置成为三号机的驾驶员，试图让第一适格者为她做一顿与指挥官和他那任性的儿子共进的小晚餐。是啊，看看这让你落得了什么下场，她的手抚过眼罩的表面。那一天，她尝试做些不同于既定目标的事情，却教会了她这一切有多么愚蠢。

The Entry Plug remained impassive; out of place beside the small house, strange, intimidatingly unfamiliar, and sticking out like an abnormality, just like its owner. How long now, how long had she been merely surviving until the next day? However empty, that existence had been something she had grown very used to; she was supposed to be a pilot, be the best, to fight and win. Otherwise nobody would accept her. Asuka sighed and shook her head. As if anybody other than Four Eyes or Kensuke had truly accepted her as she was. An entire existence, over twenty eight years, doing nothing but fighting, training, and seething in anger and solitude.  
插入栓依旧冷漠；在小屋旁显得格格不入，奇怪，令人望而生畏地陌生，就像它的主人一样突兀。她已经这样苟延残喘多久了，只是为了等待明天？然而，无论多么空洞，那种存在感她已经非常习惯了；她本应是一名驾驶员，成为最优秀的，去战斗并取得胜利。否则没有人会接受她。明日香叹了口气，摇了摇头。好像除了四眼仔和剑介之外，还有谁真正接受过她本来的样子。整整二十八年，除了战斗、训练和在愤怒与孤独中煎熬，别无他事。

Something about keeping the idiot from letting himself die felt odd, almost compelling in a sickening, unreasonable way. _It's just something different to do, that's all,_ the redhead reasoned, nodding to herself. _Compelling, bah. I'd wish for nothing else than to have that brat as far away from me as possible. I don't care about him. I_ _**don't**_ _care._  
阻止那个白痴让自己死掉的感觉很奇怪，几乎有种令人作呕、不讲道理的吸引力。只是做点不同的事罢了，红发女孩自我安慰道，对自己点了点头。吸引人？呸。我除了希望那个小鬼离我越远越好之外别无所求。我不在乎他。我不在乎。

There was nothing else other than the next mission, nothing. Fourteen years had flown by; years meant nothing to her, not anymore. Then, how come a month felt like too little time, all of the sudden? _I thought I was waiting for this, this one last chance to stop those bastards. One chance to finally fall asleep again._ She undressed and stared at her reflection, glaring deep at a body that betrayed all logic and reasoning, a body that did not age nor change. Her hair and nails grew, but nothing more; at times if felt as though her very mind was also trapped in that never-ending youth.  
除了下一个任务，别无他物。十四年光阴转瞬即逝；岁月对她已无意义，不再重要。然而，为何突然间一个月却显得如此短暂？我以为我一直在等待这一刻，这最后一次机会去阻止那些混蛋。一次机会，终于能再次安然入睡。她脱下衣物，凝视着镜中的自己，深深凝视着一具违背所有逻辑与理性的躯体，一具不老不变的躯体。她的头发和指甲在生长，但仅此而已；有时她感觉自己的心智也困在那无尽的青春之中。

"It'll be over soon," she told the redhead who glared just as intensely from the mirror. Whether it was the curse of Eva, the sickness called Angel contamination, or her life, Asuka did not clarify. She showered in a haste; the water was too damn cold and she had no intention of bothering to wait for it to warm. After a thorough rinsing of her hair and a sip of spring water, Asuka walked over to the kitchen area in the nude, seeking the next available rations and throwing them on the table. Her eye twitched when the remnants of the tea came into view. _I won't let that brat die a self-serving death, even if it means pushing this food down his throat every freaking day._  
"很快就会结束的，"她对镜中同样怒目而视的红发少女说道。无论是伊娃的诅咒、被称为天使污染的疾病，还是她的人生，明日香并未明说。她匆忙洗了个澡；水温冷得要命，她无意等待它变暖。彻底冲洗完头发并喝了一口泉水后，明日香赤裸着走向厨房区域，寻找下一顿配给的食物，并将其扔在桌上。看到残留的茶水时，她的眼角抽搐了一下。我不会让那小子自私地死去，哪怕这意味着每天都要逼他吃下这些食物。

"… sure to drink those twice a day, okay? I'm glad to see you're doing a little better, Ikari. Say hi to Shikinami for me." Toji's voice distracted her from sipping on the now cold beverage. The idiot had even found the sugar and added some to the tea; even cold, she could faintly taste it. Suzuhara was wise enough to leave Shinji by the door and did not bother coming in, himself.  
“记得一天喝两次，好吗？很高兴看到你有所好转，碇。替我向式波问好。” 冬二的声音让她从那杯已经冷掉的饮料中回过神来。这个傻瓜甚至还找到了糖，加了一些到茶里；即使冷了，她仍能隐约尝到甜味。铃原明智地让真嗣留在门口，自己也没有进来打扰。

Standing naked by the dining room, Asuka did not bother to cover herself as the boy entered the house; she spared him a sideway glance and noticed how he froze in mid-step, eyes widening, and his skin colored pink and then vermillion as he averted his eyes as quickly as humanly possible. For whatever reason, his reaction pleased her. "What?" demanded the female pilot. "What's with you?"  
站在餐厅旁赤裸着身子，明日香并没有费心去遮掩自己，当男孩进入屋内时，她只是斜眼瞥了他一眼，注意到他如何在中途停下脚步，眼睛睁大，皮肤先是泛红然后变成深红，随即尽可能快地移开视线。不知为何，他的反应让她感到满意。“怎么了？”女驾驶员质问道，“你这是怎么回事？”

"You're, uhm, n-naked." The way his hand came up to the side of his face she had kicked so long ago made some strings in her heart tighten fervently; so at least there were some pieces of him still there. He did not move at all, simply stood there by the door, eyes drawn to the ground, making his best effort to not steal glances at her exposed skin, at which he succeeded. Annoyance blossomed, followed by anger, so Asuka walked over to the bathroom and covered herself with a towel, hair still dripping wet.  
“你，呃，没穿衣服。”他抬起手抚摸那侧脸颊，她许久以前曾狠狠踢过的地方，让她的心弦不由得紧绷起来；至少，他身上还保留着一些过去的痕迹。他一动不动，只是站在门口，目光低垂，竭力避免偷瞄她裸露的肌肤，而这他做得相当成功。恼怒油然而生，继而转为愤怒，于是明日香走向浴室，用毛巾裹住自己，湿漉漉的头发还在滴水。

"There. Now stop acting like a child," she ordered with a steely growl. The jacked had almost fallen from his grasp; she noticed how the male pilot's right hand held it, neatly folded, close to his body. "I'm assuming Suzuhara gave you that bowl. Ugh, what an annoying bunch. Well, leave it at the table."  
“好了，别再像个孩子似的。”她厉声命令道，语气坚定。他手中的工具差点滑落；她注意到那位男飞行员右手稳稳地握着它，整齐地折叠着，紧贴身体。“我猜是铃原给你的那个碗。唉，真是一群烦人精。算了，就放在桌上吧。”

A bored cerulean orb went up and down Shinji's new attire; she recognized the jock's former tracksuit immediately and was half tempted to demand her jacket back. She watched him go about setting the bowl on the kitchen area, stopping to smoothe the folded cloth and carefully lay it beside the dictionary. As he rose and came face to face with Asuka, however, Shinji's eyes widened in terror instantly when the DSS choker on her neck came into view. She watched, cold and disinterested, as the Third Child bent over and retched all over the floor, wheezing on the ground as tremors began to course all over his body.  
一颗无聊的蔚蓝色眼珠上下打量着真嗣的新装束；她立刻认出了这位运动员之前的运动服，差点就想要求他把夹克还回来。她看着他忙于在厨房区域摆放碗，停下来抚平折叠的布料，并小心翼翼地将其放在字典旁边。然而，当他起身与明日香面对面时，真嗣的眼睛立刻因恐惧而睁大，因为看到了她脖子上戴的 DSS 项圈。她冷冷地、漠不关心地看着，第三适格者弯下腰，对着地板呕吐，喘息着倒在地上，全身开始颤抖。

_Fantastic,_ the fresh puddle of clear vomit continued to pool on the floor. Asuka's eye narrowed. "You barely do anything seeing me naked, but you see this little collar and you puke all over the floor." She took a few heavy steps towards the kitchen, grabbed a wet rag, an empty bucket, and hurled both in Shinji's vicinity. "Clean up your mess, brat. I'm not your maid."  
太棒了，新鲜的透明呕吐物继续在地板上积聚。明日香的眼睛眯了起来。“你看到我裸体都没事，但看到这个小项圈你就吐得满地都是。”她重重地走向厨房，抓起一块湿布和一个空桶，将两者都扔到真嗣附近。“清理你的烂摊子，小鬼。我不是你的女仆。”

The brat tried to muster up the courage to look her eye in the, still shaking and heaving. "W-Why do you have th-" Before he could finish articulating the question, a fresh wave of nausea forced the last remnants of Hikari's food onto the ground. He lay on his hands and knees, eyes frantic and mind constantly returning to the horrible moment when Kaworu had exploded before him. Unable to so much as glance at the collar, Shinji felt hot tears burn through his lids as they fell. When he next spoke, his voice came hitched, and barely audible. "Why do you have that?"  
那小子试图鼓起勇气直视她的眼睛，身体依旧颤抖不止，喘息连连。“你……你为什么有……”话未说完，一阵新的恶心感迫使光最后的食物残渣吐了出来。他双手撑地，趴在那里，眼神狂乱，脑海中不断回放着卡罗尔在他面前爆炸的恐怖瞬间。连看一眼项圈都做不到，真嗣感到滚烫的泪水灼烧着眼睑，滑落而下。再次开口时，他的声音哽咽，几乎听不清。“你为什么有那个？”

"Curse of EVA, told you already," was the only thing she revealed, frown deepening. "Clean up that crap before it stinks up the house. Go get some water, brat. _Now_."  
“EVA 的诅咒，早告诉过你了。”她只透露了这一句，眉头皱得更深。“把那堆垃圾清理掉，别让它臭了屋子。去弄点水来，小鬼。现在就去。”

Shinji paused, eyes growing increasingly terrified; he stole a final glance at her, gaze filled horror or remorse. "Is that because of me? Did I do that?"  
真嗣停了下来，眼神愈发惊恐；他最后瞥了她一眼，目光中充满了恐惧或悔恨。“那是因为我吗？是我做的吗？”

_I could break him in half right now, with nothing but a single word. Ugh, his mind is too weak. He's a little child._ "No, you stupid brat." Asuka bit out, jaw clenched, wondering why she had chosen to respond as she had. "I told you it's none of your business. Now get that cleaned up, damn it!"  
我现在只需一句话就能把他击垮。呃，他的心智太脆弱了。他只是个孩子。“不，你这个蠢小子。”明日香咬牙切齿地说，不明白自己为何选择这样回应。“我告诉过你这不关你的事。现在赶紧清理干净，该死的！”

The way he stared at the collar, as though reliving some horrible experience, unnerved her to the point that she felt ready to actually hit him in the face. _Did you do that? Do what, you brat? Bite my Entry Plug in half? No, you didn't do that. Let your father bite my Entry Plug in half?_ _**That**__. That's what you did._ After a few seconds, the boy gave a somber nod, averting his gaze from hers, and rose to hastily collect water from the reservoir outside.  
他盯着项圈的样子，仿佛在重温某种可怕的经历，让她感到不安，甚至想真的给他一巴掌。你做了什么？做什么，你这小子？把我的插入栓咬成两半？不，你没有。让你父亲把我的插入栓咬成两半？对，就是那个。几秒钟后，男孩沉重地点了点头，避开她的目光，起身匆忙从外面的水库取水。

Asuka saw the regression begin to take place in seconds; he was closing himself off again. The shocked expression was starting to transform in that detached stare she had seen after retrieving him from the Entry Plug; the thought of having to carry the idiot around like a rag doll began to irk her beyond belief. As he cleaned, lost in a haze of whichever memory the choker triggered, she headed for the room and dressed in some shorts, the military jacket and lastly, after much consideration, a scarf. _Can't have this idiot puking all over the house for no reason._  
明日香眼看着他几秒钟内又开始封闭自己；他再次将自己隔绝起来。那震惊的表情正逐渐转变为她从插入栓里救出他后所见的那种漠然凝视；想到不得不像拖个破布娃娃一样带着这个白痴到处走，她简直烦透了。他一边打扫，一边沉浸在项圈触发的某种记忆迷雾中，她则走向房间，穿上短裤，套上军装夹克，最后经过一番深思熟虑，围上了一条围巾。总不能让这个白痴无缘无故把家里吐得一团糟。

Once she emerged, most of the mess had been rinsed off the floor; Shinji refused to meet her eyes, choosing to focus solely on removing the bile, hands shaking and body trembling ever so often. It came as a slight surprise that he remembered to go in the bathroom and brush his teeth. _Just what I needed,_ she thought with annoyance. _Now his immune system is gonna crash because of whatever this stupid choker triggers in him, Great. Perfect._ She sat by the table, produced the Wonderswan from a jacket pocket and began to play. Despite her best efforts, Asuka still sensed every one of Shinji's movements; she saw how he basically crawled back to his sad little corner, plugged the buds in his ears and picked the heavy book, probably to browse upon the next word she had marked.  
她一出来，地板上的大部分污渍已被冲刷干净；真嗣拒绝与她对视，只顾着颤抖着双手清理呕吐物，身体时不时地颤抖。他记得去浴室刷牙，这倒让她有些意外。她烦躁地想，这下好了，他的免疫系统会因为这愚蠢的项圈引发的反应而崩溃，真是太棒了。完美。她坐在桌旁，从夹克口袋里掏出 Wonderswan 掌机开始玩。尽管她尽力不去注意，但仍能感知到真嗣的每一个动作；她看到他几乎是爬回他那可怜的小角落，塞上耳机，拿起那本厚重的书，大概是准备翻阅她标记的下一个单词。

_This is stupid._ The silence stretched between them; with nothing but the faint echo of the songs, her game and the flipping of pages marking the passing of time. At some point the idiot apparently memorized whatever he was reading, closed the dictionary and gingerly placed it on top of the jacket. The way he curled into a tight little ball, with his legs held tightly against his chest only worked to annoy her all the more. _What am I doing? Why does that stupid little video keep playing in my mind? Why did I-Why am I… why am I glad this brat had the decency to look away? This foolishness needs to stop._  
这真是愚蠢。沉默在他们之间蔓延；只有微弱的歌曲回声、她的游戏和翻页声标志着时间的流逝。不知何时，那个白痴显然已经记住了他正在读的内容，合上了字典，小心翼翼地把它放在夹克上。他蜷缩成一个小小的球，双腿紧紧抱在胸前，这只会让她更加恼火。我在做什么？为什么那个愚蠢的小视频一直在我的脑海里播放？为什么我——为什么我……为什么我会因为这小子有礼貌地移开视线而感到高兴？这种愚蠢的行为必须停止。

More than two long hours passed with neither saying a thing; the bowl Shinji had brought from the Suzuhara household at on the table, untouched, as Asuka played and Shinji sat on the old futon, listening to the SDAT's last song over and over again. After the eighth time she conquered the final level of the game, the redhead exhaled in exasperation and realized neither the rations she had left on the table nor whatever Suzuhara had sent had been touched.  
两个多小时过去了，两人都没有说话；真嗣从铃原家带来的碗放在桌上，无人问津，而明日香在玩游戏，真嗣坐在旧被褥上，一遍又一遍地听着 SDAT 的最后一首歌。在她第八次攻克游戏的最后一关后，红发女孩无奈地叹了口气，意识到桌上她留下的口粮和铃原送来的东西都没有被碰过。

The silence and the boy's lack of movement whatsoever rubbed against her limited patience. Every second felt heavy, every moment filled with tension and unease. Every second he failed to move or so much as blink like a regular human being brought her closer to a state of fluctuating fury. "Those rations have been sitting on the table for hours," she bit out, eye focused on the game and not the Third Child. "Eat."  
沉默与男孩的完全静止不断挑战着她有限的耐心。每一秒都显得沉重，每一刻都充满了紧张与不安。他每多一秒不动或连眨眼这种常人的动作都不做，就让她更接近一种起伏不定的愤怒。“那些补给品已经在桌上放了几个小时了，”她咬牙切齿地说，眼睛盯着游戏而不是第三适格者。“吃。”

She counted ten, twenty, thirty seconds, and upon receiving no answer almost slammed the handheld on the table. "I think I spoke loudly enough." Just as the anger began to bubble out and fuel her actions, so did the unease of thinking of having to force-feed the boy a second time. _This is a task, a mission, nothing more. There's no other meaning behind it. Stop thinking about that day, stop thinking about that video. Just stop, Asuka._ "Eat the damn rations, brat."  
她数了十秒、二十秒、三十秒，没有得到回应，差点把手持设备摔在桌上。“我想我说得够大声了。”就在愤怒开始涌出并驱使她行动时，那种不得不再次强迫喂食男孩的不安感也随之而来。这是一项任务，一个使命，仅此而已。背后没有其他含义。别再想那天，别再想那段视频。停下来，明日香。“吃掉那些该死的补给品，小鬼。”

The boy had the decency to give her a tentative glance and look away; her mind must have been playing tricks on her, for the redhead thought she saw his skin flush slightly. "I heard you," Shinji mumbled in return. "I'm not hungry right now." Then his stomach decided to betray him as it growled, having been unmercifully emptied just hours before.  
男孩还算有礼貌地朝她投来试探性的一瞥，随即移开了目光；或许是她的错觉，红发女孩觉得他的脸颊微微泛红。“我听到了，”真嗣含糊地回应，“我现在不饿。”然而他的肚子却在这时背叛了他，发出咕噜声，毕竟几个小时前才被无情地清空。

He had not only seen Asuka naked, but also puked all over the floor of what he assumed was her house. Shame became a new, wonderful addition to the negative feelings overwhelming his every breath and constricting his every movement. In the brief seconds he had mustered up the courage to look at her, the image of her bare skin had flashed over his brain.  
他不仅见过明日香裸体，还在他猜测是她家的地板上吐得一塌糊涂。羞愧成了新的美妙负担，压倒性的负面情绪充斥着他的每一次呼吸，束缚着他的每一个动作。在他鼓起勇气看她的短暂瞬间，她裸露肌肤的画面在他脑海中一闪而过。

"I'm not deaf." The Major's hands fisted; she was so angry all of the sudden, so incredibly dissatisfied with his moping attitude that she never realized when the pale-colored ration was gripped in her hand and she stood and stalked over to where Shinji lay, blissfully ignoring that he was still recovering from a fever, and had just relived a sickening memory which probably had him nauseated still. "I just heard your stomach grumble. I'm not going to say this a third time." She stood before him in a manner not unlike when then had first met. She lowered her head, hands on her hips, to glare straight at his face. "Eat. Now. Do something for once in your damn life."  
"我不是聋子。" 少校的双手紧握成拳；她突然如此愤怒，对他那垂头丧气的态度感到极度不满，以至于她都没意识到自己何时握住了那块淡色的口粮，站起身来，走到躺在那里的真嗣身边，全然不顾他还在从发烧中恢复，刚刚又经历了一次令人作呕的回忆，可能仍让他感到恶心。"我刚刚听到你肚子咕咕叫。我不会再说第三遍了。"她站在他面前，姿态与他们初次见面时如出一辙。她低下头，双手叉腰，直直地瞪着他的脸。"吃。现在。你他妈的这辈子总得做点什么。"

"Why should I?" he retorted, refusing to look at her. "Every time I do something, everybody gets hurt."  
"我为什么要这么做？" 他反驳道，拒绝看她。"每次我做点什么，每个人都会受伤。"

_Then what was that stupid tantrum about, huh?_ Almost blinded by her own misery and wrath, ignited by his defeatist statement, Asuka pushed him onto the floor, and pressed a knee against his midsection. A crumbled piece of the protein bar was forced into Shinji's mouth; her heart was hammering in her chest. "What, so now after you've done all this, you're just going to sit there and do nothing! Have a taste of this tasteless crap! This is what your stupid inaction gave everybody else!" The Second Child was taken aback by the renewed resistance Shinji was displaying; he almost crawled away and tried to fight her off, but her reflexes and years of practice were too keen.  
那刚才那场愚蠢的闹剧又是怎么回事，嗯？几乎被自己的痛苦和愤怒蒙蔽了双眼，他的失败主义言论更是火上浇油，明日香将他推倒在地，用膝盖压住他的腹部。一块皱巴巴的蛋白棒碎片被强行塞进真嗣的嘴里；她的心跳如擂鼓般在胸腔中回响。“怎么，现在你做了这一切之后，就打算坐在那里什么都不做吗！尝尝这索然无味的东西！这就是你那愚蠢的不作为带给其他人的！”二号机驾驶员对真嗣展现出的新抵抗感到意外；他几乎要爬开并试图反抗，但她的反应速度和多年训练的敏锐度远胜于他。

She pushed a second piece of bar onto Shinji's mouth, who, in a rare act of defiance, spit it out almost instantly. "Why do you think I wanted to punch you the moment I saw you, huh?" The scream thundered over the empty walls of the house. Once more, Asuka never noticed how her voice quivered ever so lightly, eve as it gained volume and became a scream. "Have you even given any thought to that, _have you_? What the hell are you reading that stupid dictionary for, if you don't understand anything? You weak little brat, stay still!"  
她将第二块巧克力棒塞进真嗣嘴里，而他竟罕见地表现出反抗，几乎立刻就吐了出来。“你以为我为什么一见到你就想揍你，嗯？”尖叫声在空荡荡的屋墙间回荡。又一次，明日香未曾察觉自己的声音是如何微微颤抖，即便它逐渐放大，变成了尖叫。“你有没有想过这一点，有没有？你到底在看那本愚蠢的字典做什么，如果你什么都不懂？你这个弱小的臭小子，给我老实点！”

In an effort to keep him in place, Asuka's free hand unintentionally clenched around his bandaged wrist, eliciting a loud hiss and an expression of absolute grimace, akin to the one she had seen when first cleansing the infection off the cut. Her grip loosened in an instant, and just as it had arrived, the wrath quieted down and decreased to the permanent low hum she had gotten used to. It was only after getting off the male pilot, and stiffly getting back to her feet that Asuka realized her fist had been raised and almost ready to strike him.  
为了让他安分，明日香无意识地用空着的手紧紧抓住他包扎好的手腕，引得他一声痛呼，脸上露出极度痛苦的表情，就像她第一次清洗伤口上的感染时所见的那样。她的手立刻松开了，怒气也随之平息，降到了她早已习惯的低沉状态。直到从男飞行员身上下来，僵硬地站起身，明日香才意识到自己的拳头已经举起，几乎要打向他。

Shinji sat up, rolled up the jacket sleeve and brought the bandaged to view, hissing a second time as he clenched and unclenched his hand. She saw a small stain begin to color the white gauze; her stomach lurched and the image of a certain bento resurfaced with a vengeance. In her anger, the redhead had also unconsciously revealed the main reason for her anger and dissatisfaction with the Third Child. On top of everything, the wound she had produced had probably reopened.  
真嗣坐起身，卷起夹克袖子，露出包扎处，握拳又松开时再次发出嘶声。她看到一小块血迹开始染红白色纱布；她的胃一阵翻腾，某个便当的画面带着报复性的记忆浮现。在愤怒中，红发女孩也不自觉地暴露了她对第三适格者愤怒和不满意的主要原因。除此之外，她造成的伤口可能已经再次裂开。

Another silence stretched between them. Her pride kept the girl rooted on her stance, arms crossed, glare obscuring her features as Shinji's own frown drifted from the book to the SDAT, and the pieces of protein bar lying beside him. Without a word, he picked the largest, relatively untouched piece and began to take demure bites of it. The reddish mark on the bandage was small, but present; it felt like the mark was glaring right back at her.  
又是一阵沉默在他们之间蔓延。她的骄傲让女孩坚定地站在原地，双臂交叉，锐利的目光掩盖了她的表情，而真嗣自己的眉头则从书本移到了 SDAT 上，以及他身边散落的蛋白棒碎片。他一言不发，捡起最大的一块，相对完整的部分，开始小心翼翼地咬着。绷带上那块红色的痕迹虽小，却清晰可见；感觉那痕迹正直勾勾地回瞪着她。

The young pilot sluggishly got to his feet, passed by her, eyes downcast, and walked over to the table to pick a second protein bar. He ate the second much quicker than he did the first, going through the third in what felt like a rush. Asuka heard him gulp down some water along with the antibiotic, eye twitching in annoyance. Annoyance directed at him, at herself, or at everything, it was unclear which it was.  
年轻的驾驶员缓慢地站起身，从她身边走过，目光低垂，走向桌子拿起第二根蛋白棒。他吃第二根的速度比第一根快得多，第三根几乎是一口气吞下的。明日香听到他咽下水和抗生素的声音，眼角因恼怒而抽搐。恼怒是针对他，还是自己，或是针对一切，她自己也说不清楚。

"There, I ate," Shinji stated from the table. For the first time he addressed her without stammering, even if he did not yet dare to look straight at her. His tired feet dragged him over to the door, fully intent of putting at least some distance between himself and everyone else, even for a while. "I think I'm going out for a bit."  
“好了，我吃了。”真嗣从桌子那边说道。这是他第一次没有结巴地对她说话，尽管他仍不敢直视她。他疲惫的双脚拖着他走向门口，他完全打算暂时离开其他人，哪怕只是一会儿。“我想我出去一下。”

_That shouldn't have - I didn't mean to do that. But I did. I did._ She feigned nonchalance; it was easier to fall back into a familiar behavior pattern than to deal with all these unwanted, unnecessary emotions, after all. "Do what you want. So long as you don't croak stupidly, I don't care. Just remember, brat." Shinji paused by the door. "You still haven't done a single thing to earn your permission. Not in my eyes."  
那本不该——我不是有意那么做的。但我确实做了。做了。她佯装若无其事；毕竟，回归熟悉的行动模式比处理这些多余且不必要的情绪要容易得多。“随你便吧。只要你别愚蠢地死去，我无所谓。只是记住，小鬼。”真嗣在门口停下脚步。“你至今未曾做过任何一件事来赢得我的认可。在我眼里，你还没有。”

The door opened and a gust of cold night air filtered in the house. "I know," Shinji retorted, barely loud enough for her to hear.  
门开了，一阵寒夜的冷风悄然潜入屋内。“我知道。”真嗣反驳道，声音微弱得几乎让她听不清。

She scowled at the doorframe for some time after he disappeared behind it; the thought of trailing after him only to deck him in the jaw for good measure took a few minutes to dissipate. _There you go,_ her mind remarked boringly. _Look at you, wasting time on this. Let the idiot go and trip over a root and scratch his knees like a toddler. He'll last a few hours with what he ate, at the least._ Snatching the WonderSwan off the table, Asuka threw herself on the mattress and began the ritualized pressing of buttons after changing the cartridge, all in a fruitless effort to rid her mind of any thoughts regarding the annoying prisoner she had been burdened with.  
他在门后消失后，她对着门框皱眉良久；想到尾随其后只为趁机给他下巴一拳的念头，过了几分钟才消散。瞧瞧你，在这浪费时间，她乏味地想。让那蠢货自己去绊个树根，像小孩一样擦破膝盖吧。他吃了那些东西，至少能撑几个小时。阿斯娜抓起桌上的 WonderSwan，扑倒在床垫上，换上新卡带后开始机械地按动按钮，试图以此驱散心中关于那个烦人囚犯的任何思绪，但这一切努力都是徒劳。

"Some prisoner," she grumbled under her breath right after passing onto the game's next level. "Free to roam around and run away as he pleases. I should've just tased him." The grimness of her own reaction to Shinji's attitude was still baffling. Uncertainty, unease, anger, resignation; emotions not unlike the ones she had felt before embarking on the mission to retrieve Unit 01. She tried to reject them and forced her eye to focus on the screen. He had been stealing glances at the hat again, just before the situation turned sour. _I basically punched him with food, what would've been worse, really? At least if I had tased him, he wouldn't have resisted as much and that stupid cut wouldn't have reopened. And now I have to redress it. Great, just great._  
"真是自由的囚犯，"她刚进入游戏的下一关就低声抱怨道，"爱怎么溜达就怎么溜达，想跑就跑。我真该用电击枪对付他。"她对自己对真嗣态度的反应感到困惑。不确定、不安、愤怒、无奈，这些情绪在她出发去回收零号机之前也曾体验过。她试图摒弃这些情绪，强迫自己盯着屏幕。就在情况变糟之前，他又在偷瞄那顶帽子。我基本上是用食物揍了他一顿，还能更糟吗？至少如果我用电击枪，他就不会那么激烈反抗，那该死的伤口也不会再次裂开。现在我还得重新包扎。真是太好了，简直棒极了。

Four-Eyes' foolish words had even made her tape up the old, worn-out Plug-Suit, wearing the damned thing had awoken that stupid memory again, that memory that haunted her at night when she gazed at the moon, and a carefree smile came to greet her. The only piece of normalcy in her life, now tainted as well. Yet despite how precious the memory seemed to be to some part of her, Asuka continued to reject it, along with rejecting the realization that she was, in fact, acting in a confusing and overly contradictive manner.  
四眼仔的蠢话甚至让她重新裹上了那件破旧的插线服，穿上这该死的东西又唤醒了那段愚蠢的记忆，那段在夜晚凝望月亮时萦绕心头的记忆，以及随之而来的无忧无虑的微笑。她生活中唯一的一抹常态，如今也被玷污了。尽管那段记忆对她的某部分来说似乎弥足珍贵，但明日香仍继续抗拒着它，连带抗拒着意识到自己实际上在以一种混乱且矛盾重重的方式行事。

One moment she was picking up a blanket to cover Shinji with, ensuring his sickness did not advance by throwing him the jacket, and the next she was pushing him to the ground and basically slapping him with a protein bar. _Stupid brat's stomach was growling, and he was just sitting there like a spoiled child. Then when I ask him something, he chooses to run away instead of answering._ The game's battery began to run low just around the time the door opened, and footsteps heavier than Shinji's rang through the wooden floor. A heavy bag was placed by the table as the steps neared the room.  
前一刻她还在捡起毯子给真嗣盖上，确保他的病情不会加重，顺手把夹克扔给他，下一秒她就把他推倒在地，几乎是用蛋白棒扇了他一巴掌。这蠢小子的肚子咕咕叫，他却像个被宠坏的孩子一样坐在那里。然后当我问他问题时，他选择逃跑而不是回答。游戏机的电池恰好在门打开的时候耗尽，脚步声比真嗣的重，响彻木地板。一个沉重的包被放在桌旁，随着脚步声接近房间。

"Shikinami, hey!" Kensuke greeted, fully dressed in a vest and black cargo pants, giving her the relaxed grin which had for so long become familiar. "How've you been doing lately? I heard Ikari was in the village!"  
"式波，嘿！" 健司打着招呼，全副武装地穿着背心和黑色工装裤，给了她一个久违的轻松微笑。"最近怎么样？我听说真嗣在村子里！"

"Hey, KenKen," she grumbled from bed, not really looking at him as her frown melted into a sulk. The man's presence only worked to settle whatever remorse she was feeling into the base of her belly. "Same as always. Brat ran away, he's probably around the lime fields right around now."  
"嘿，健健，" 她躺在床上咕哝着，并没有真正看他，她的皱眉变成了闷闷不乐。这个男人的出现只是让她的任何悔意沉淀在腹部。"老样子。那小子跑了，现在大概在石灰田附近。"

A sideway glance confirmed the slight frown appear on the Kensuke's face. "Damn, I hope he's okay. Has he been eating at all?"  
一个侧目确认了 Kensuke 脸上微微的皱眉。“该死，希望他没事。他到底有没有吃东西？”

"Basically force-fed him a second time, then he decided to eat by himself." A pause; she grew bored of the game, placed it on the mattress and sat up to give her host a deadpan stare. "He'll last a few more hours, at least."  
“基本上是第二次强行喂他，然后他决定自己吃。”她停顿了一下；对游戏感到厌倦，将其放在床垫上并坐起来，给她的主人一个死气沉沉的凝视。“他至少还能撑几个小时。”

Kensuke nodded, eyes drifting to the floor where the broken pieces of the cellphone were easy to make out. _Well,_ he thought with a bit of humor. _There goes a full day of searching. Jeez, Shikinami; I hope that you at least took the time to watch the video._ "Thanks for taking care of him," he stated with a smile. "You didn't have to, and you did."  
Kensuke 点头，目光飘向地板上显而易见的破碎手机残骸。好吧，他带着一丝幽默想。这下子一天的搜索全泡汤了。天哪，式波；我希望你至少抽空看了那段视频。“谢谢你照顾他，”他微笑着说。“你本不必这么做，但你做了。”

The comment earned him a heated glare from the Second Child. "I didn't do it for him," she spat out, wrath leaked off her tone and made her statement sound absolute and irrefutable. "I won't let that idiot die a self-serving death. If he wants to die, he has to earn the right."  
这番话招致了二女儿的激烈怒视。“我这么做不是为了他，”她咬牙切齿地说，语气中的愤怒让她的声明显得绝对且不容置疑。“我不会让那个白痴死得那么自私。如果他想死，他得先争取到这个权利。”

_That's certainly macabre; living just to earn your right to die,_ thought the Commander, taking a few steps off the room to recognize Asuka's jacket neatly folded in what he assumed was the cot where Shinji was sleeping. He also saw the dictionary which had gotten 'lost' some time before, sitting comfortably above the jacket, and just on the book's cover, lay the SDAT he remembered Shinji carried around all the time. "I suppose at this point the best we can do right now is leave him be. If he went to the lime fields, after all, he's as safe as he can be."  
那确实有些阴森；活着仅仅是为了赢得死亡的权利，指挥官心想，他走出房间几步，注意到明日香的外套整齐地叠放在他认为真嗣睡觉的床上。他还看到了那本之前‘丢失’的词典，舒适地放在外套上方，而在书的封面上，放着那个他记得真嗣一直随身携带的 SDAT。“我想现在我们能做的最好的事情就是让他一个人待着。毕竟，如果他去了石灰地，那他就已经尽可能安全了。”

Kensuke went over to the bag he was carrying and began unloading several broken pieces of technology and storing them in their preferred boxes. "I'm sure he'll be fine, you'll see."  
剑介走到他携带的包旁，开始卸下几件损坏的科技零件，并将它们存放在它们偏好的盒子里。“我相信他会没事的，你会看到的。”

"Not like I care," came Asuka's clipped reply; she rummaged through the closet and produced the old doll she had owned for many years, and once she retrieved it, paused for a few seconds by the closet door. There was a smaller one, not truly a doll but more some sort of plushy, one she had found about ten years before whilst walking in the outskirts of the village. The small plushy had dark brown hair and two big blue eyes painted on it. Mari had discovered it at some point and painted the thing's clothes blue and purple, drawing a huge 01 on its back.  
“我才不在乎呢。”明日香简短地回了一句；她在衣橱里翻找，拿出了她拥有多年的旧娃娃，一拿到手，便在衣橱门前停顿了几秒。还有一个更小的，严格来说不算娃娃，更像某种毛绒玩具，是她大约十年前在村子外围散步时发现的。这个小毛绒有着深棕色的头发和两只画上去的大蓝眼睛。玛丽不知何时发现了它，并把它的衣服涂成了蓝紫色，还在背后画了一个大大的 01。

She closed the closet door and threw herself on the bed a second time. Kensuke went about reorganizing whatever important spare parts he had acquired in his latest trip to the ruins. The doll danced above her, dead eyes glazing into hers with the permanent smile which had been her only true companion for years. Even if Kensuke was used to her, and through the years she had become comfortable around him, there was naught but a sense of familiarity. The solitude never waned, not even a tiny bit.  
她关上衣柜门，再次扑倒在床上。健介忙于重新整理他在最近一次废墟探险中获得的重要备用零件。那个玩偶在她上方翩翩起舞，死寂的双眼凝视着她，那永恒的微笑多年来一直是她唯一的真正伴侣。尽管健介已经习惯了她，随着时间的推移，她在他的陪伴下也变得自在，但除了熟悉感之外，别无他物。孤独感从未减弱，哪怕一丝一毫。

"You're alone," she said to the doll in the mantra she had perfected since her early childhood. "Nobody will care, nobody will accept you unless you pilot. And even then, heh, even then, you're still alone. Always." The doll nodded in enthusiasm; at the least, the small toy never disagreed with her, it never offered words of comfort, either, but at least it was not clinging to her like Four Eyes preferred to do. "It's just the way this life is. You're used to it."  
"你孤身一人，"她对着玩偶念叨着自幼便熟练的咒语，"无人会在意，无人会接纳你，除非你成为驾驶员。即便如此，呵，即便如此，你依旧孤独。永远。"玩偶热情地点头；至少，这个小玩具从不反驳她，也从不给予安慰的话语，但至少它不像四眼那样总爱黏着她。"这就是这种生活的常态。你早已习惯了。"

Her eye betrayed her, glancing over the closet, to the corner where the pathetic little plushy was stored. The citrus fields including limes, lemon and orange trees close to Kensuke's house were in the center of an overgrown forest area; the ground tended to get muddy due to a natural spring occurring near the older cherry trees. Roots were sometimes hard to dodge if one was not careful; some were formed in hooks perfect for tripping someone. She tried to focus every last bit of her attention in the doll and her mantra, to no avail. Again, Asuka's gaze returned to the closet, and her memory flashed with the sight of the stained bandage. Another fall and the damned cut could get infected again, a fall into the mud or the spring and the fever was sure to return. More days of tending to a sickly brat who could not even get up by himself, let alone eat.  
她的眼神出卖了她，不经意间扫过衣柜，停留在那个角落，那里存放着那只可怜兮兮的小毛绒玩具。柑橘园，包括莱姆、柠檬和橙子树，紧挨着 Kensuke 的家，位于一片茂密的森林中央；由于附近古老的樱花树旁有一处天然泉眼，地面常常变得泥泞不堪。如果不小心，那些树根有时很难避开；有些树根弯曲成钩状，极易绊倒人。她试图将全部注意力集中在玩偶和她的咒语上，却徒劳无功。又一次，Asuka 的目光回到了衣柜，记忆中闪现出那块染血的绷带。再摔一次，那该死的伤口可能会再次感染，摔进泥泞或泉水中，高烧必定会卷土重来。又得照顾一个连自己都站不起来，更别提吃饭的病弱小鬼，日子愈发难熬。

"God damn it," she threw the doll next to the WonderSwan, tightened the jacket around her, turning to the closet to grab a hold of a pair of shorts and boots. She marched out the door in a huff, and just as she was about to open the door, Kensuke spoke from the kitchen, where he was inspecting the bowl Shinji had brought.  
“该死，”她将娃娃扔到 WonderSwan 旁边，紧了紧外套，转身走向衣柜抓起一条短裤和靴子。她气冲冲地走出房门，就在她准备开门时，厨房里的剑介开口了，他正在检查真嗣带来的碗。

"Hey, Shikinami, it did strike me as a little weird that you guys got picked up and dropped off so quickly," he mentioned while disarming what looked to be the mainframe of an old computer. "Did the Colonel have a sudden change of heart or something?"  
“嘿，式波，你们这么快就被接走又送回来，有点奇怪啊，”他一边说着，一边拆解着一台旧电脑的主板。“是上校突然改变主意了吗？”

Asuka stopped by the entrance, and pointed to her eyepatch without fully turning. "Unit 02 took a lot of damage, so the restraint needed to be changed." Had she been looking at him, she would have seen Kensuke grimace slightly. "The brat was a coincidence. They decided it was better to not waste ship supplies or energy on him." She shook her head in derision and anger. "And then Misato tells me this is supposed to be a vacation or something."  
明日香在门口停下，没有完全转身，指了指她的眼罩。“二号机受损严重，所以束缚器需要更换。”如果她看着他，就会看到剑介微微皱眉。“那小子只是碰巧。他们认为不值得为他浪费船上的物资和能源。”她带着轻蔑和愤怒摇了摇头。“然后美里告诉我这应该算是度假什么的。”

A small, comfortable silence followed, one in which Kensuke grew increasingly puzzled and amused at the redhead's actions and words. _She's planning to go look for him, after all. Shikinami, after all these years, I'm really happy for you. I bet he can actually make you smile. Wouldn't that be something?_  
一阵小小的、舒适的沉默随之而来，期间健介对红发女孩的言行越来越感到困惑和好笑。毕竟，她打算去找他。这么多年了，式波，我真的为你高兴。我敢打赌，他真的能让你笑出来。那不是很棒吗？

"I just got a call," he said in an amiable tone. "Looks like he's by the stream, you know the one. Apparently he's just sitting there." He opened the bowl, smelled its content and smiled. "Good luck, see you in a few."  
“我刚接到一个电话，”他用友好的语气说道，“看来他在小溪边，你知道的那条。显然他只是坐在那里。”他打开碗，闻了闻内容物，笑了笑，“祝你好运，一会儿见。”

"Luck for what? Pff, yeah, see you in a few," she agreed, closed the door and pushed her fisted hands into the military jacket. The taser felt heavier than the cuffs had but if it came to it, she would electrocute Shinji and drag him by his feet back to the house. His debt was yet to be settled. _Is that what you want, some debt repaid? Is it?_ Her mind demanded, impatient. _Are you still not done lying to yourself?_  
“好运什么？噗，好吧，一会儿见，”她同意道，关上门，将拳头塞进军装外套里。电击器感觉比手铐重，但如果需要的话，她会用电击器电击真嗣，拖着他的脚回到房子里。他的债务还未偿还。这就是你想要的吗，偿还一些债务？是吗？她的内心急切地质问，你还在对自己撒谎吗？

_I don't care about that idiot. I don't. I'm just making sure he -_ As she walked through the trees, Asuka's permanent glare melted away, and eye reflected, for once, the solitude and misery she felt. Somewhere, from a distant part of her, buried and hidden, a small child screamed she no longer wanted to be alone. The scream was muffled, nevertheless, and it never fully reached Asuka's mind. "I don't even know what I'm doing."  
我不在乎那个白痴。真的不在乎。我只是确保他——当她穿过树林时，明日香那惯常的怒视消散了，眼中难得映出了她感受到的孤独与痛苦。在某个遥远而隐蔽的角落，一个小孩的尖叫声在心底响起，她再也不想孤单一人。然而，这尖叫声被压抑着，始终未能完全触及明日香的意识。“我甚至不知道自己在做什么。”

---

_I never said I wasn't going to eat,_ Shinji pondered bitterly. He sat near what he assumed was a pond, surrounded by trees both large and small, some of them permeated the air with a citric scent, which made the entire area smell of fresh forest and wet soil. The grass under him was comfortable enough, and the tracksuit provided by Toji did wonders to protect him from the cold. _I was feeling nauseated. I just rememb-_  
我从没说过我不打算吃东西，真嗣苦涩地想着。他坐在他认为是一个池塘的地方，四周是大小不一的树木，其中一些散发着柑橘的香气，让整个区域弥漫着新鲜的森林和湿润泥土的气息。身下的草地颇为舒适，而东治提供的运动服也极好地抵御了寒冷。我当时感到恶心。我只是记得——

The memory flashed again, Kaworu exploded into a thousand pieces of blood and gore. He shook his head, focusing on the sting of the cut on his wrist to try and keep the food in his stomach. More important than the protein bars and water, he was not supposed to be wasting antibiotics, so after several deep breaths, Shinji managed to keep the latest flashback from reducing him into pile of tremors and stammers. He glared at the water, gripping the black material under his palms. Asuka's jacket had been much softer, and more comfortable. _I don't understand why she did that. I get that she's angry, I get that. But why. Why did she have to ask me that?_  
记忆再次闪现，渚薰炸裂成千片血肉。他摇摇头，集中精神感受手腕割伤的刺痛，试图稳住胃里的食物。比起蛋白质棒和水，更关键的是他不该浪费抗生素，于是在几次深呼吸后，真嗣设法让最近的闪回没有将他击垮成一团颤抖和结巴。他瞪着水，紧握掌下的黑色布料。明日香的夹克曾经柔软得多，也更舒适。我不明白她为何那样做。我理解她在生气，我理解。但为什么。为什么她非得问我那个问题？

He did not want to be near Asuka, not at the moment. Every time he had tried to gaze at her in the last hours the image of her naked body had replaced her glare, and if his skin heating up and embarrassment were not enough, there was no possible way for him to dismiss the fact that Asuka was wearing one of those dreadful chokers, as well. All due to him, most likely; fourteen years had passed, and she had not changed, not in the physical sense. She had looked almost exactly the same as that time in the apartment, when a kick to the face had been his reward for looking in the wrong moment.  
他此刻并不想靠近明日香。每当他试图在过去几小时内凝视她时，她的裸体形象就会取代她的怒视，而如果皮肤发热和尴尬还不够的话，他无法忽视一个事实：明日香也戴着那些可怕的项圈，很可能也是因为他。十四年过去了，她在身体上并没有改变。她看起来几乎和在公寓里的那次一模一样，当时他因为不合时宜地看了一眼而遭到了一记踢脸。

_I don't know what I'm supposed to do, I don't know how to answer your question without you getting mad,_ he thought. If he focused on the annoyance and anger the day had produced in him, if he focused on the smiles of the villagers, his thoughts became just a bit clearer, if only for a few seconds. _Everything I say is wrong, everything I do hurts you. What can I do?_ "Can you please tell me what I can do, _please_?" He whispered to the trees. "Mother," mumbled the boy in dejection. He buried his face in his lap, biting into his cheek to keep from crying even more useless tears. "What can I do?"  
我不知道该怎么做，我不知道如何回答你的问题而不让你生气。" 他想。如果他专注于这一天给他带来的烦恼和愤怒，如果他专注于村民们的微笑，他的思绪会稍微清晰一些，哪怕只是几秒钟。我说的每句话都是错的，我做的每件事都伤害了你。我能做什么？"你能告诉我该怎么做吗，求你了？" 他对着树木低语。"母亲，" 男孩沮丧地喃喃自语。他把脸埋在膝盖上，咬住脸颊以抑制更多无用的泪水。"我能做什么？

Owls, crickets and other nocturnal creatures created a small concert he had scarcely, if ever heard before. As if to mock him, life decided to manifest itself instead of providing an answer to its destroyer. There were no words of encouragement, only the world shoving in his face that despite his stupidity, life was still thriving. Shinji had never heard an owl sing, but was so engrossed in misery that not even their calls and hoots in the night were of any importance.  
猫头鹰、蟋蟀及其他夜行生物共同编织了一场小型音乐会，他几乎从未，或者说从未聆听过这样的演奏。仿佛在嘲弄他，生命选择展现自身而非向其毁灭者提供答案。没有鼓励的话语，只有世界无情地向他展示，尽管他愚蠢，生命依旧蓬勃。真嗣从未听过猫头鹰的歌唱，但此刻他深陷痛苦，以至于连夜空中它们的呼唤与啼鸣都变得无关紧要。

"I hate this," he said to the pond. "I hate it. Why can't I stop feeling like this?"  
“我讨厌这样，”他对池塘说，“我讨厌。为什么我不能停止这种感觉？”

There he sat, seemingly alone but for the night creatures and the trees, watching as time went by and the blood-covered moon half-reflected in the water. The lack of his SDAT alerted Shinji of heavy footsteps rumbling through the dead leaves, and of a loud, yet soothing voice coming from his right.  
他就那样坐着，仿佛独自一人，除了夜间的生物和树木，看着时间流逝，血染的月亮在水面上半映。没有 SDAT 的提醒，真嗣察觉到沉重的脚步声在枯叶中隆隆作响，以及一个响亮却抚慰人心的声音从右侧传来。

"-hand me your doubts, worries and fears, within this embrace, they shall all disappear." His head tilted to the sound.  
“-把你的疑虑、担忧和恐惧交给我，在这个拥抱中，它们都将消失。”他随着声音转过头。

"A love beyond, a love unreal! The sadness you felt, you will no longer feel." Shinji's eyes drew to the figure now visible in the moonlight. "This world and all that there is, I give it to you! _All_ to you! Hand me your love and all that you are! Could you promise me, as I promise you?"  
"超越的爱，虚幻的爱！你所感受的悲伤，你将不再感受。" 真嗣的目光被月光下显现的身影吸引。"这个世界及其中的一切，我都献给你！全都献给你！将你的爱和一切交给我！你能像我承诺的那样承诺我吗？"

He recognized a man of about Toji's height and build, swaying to whatever song he was hearing with something that looked not unlike his SDAT. The intrusive figure had what looked to be clear, almost blonde hair, but the dim light made it difficult to see much more of him. He continued to sway and dance; the boy saw him analyze the ripe limes hanging from the branches and pick the best ones in the dim moonlight, which he deposited in a bag which hung from his belt as he whispered in what he assumed was English. Upon locking eyes with him, said stranger stopped his singing and smiled placidly, turning to walk in his direction.  
他认出一个大约和东治身高体型相仿的男人，随着他听到的歌曲摇摆，手里拿着的东西看起来很像他的 SDAT。这个闯入的身影有着近乎透明的、几乎是金色的头发，但昏暗的光线让他难以看清更多细节。他继续摇摆和跳舞；男孩看到他在昏暗的月光下分析挂在树枝上的成熟青柠，挑选出最好的那些，放入挂在腰间的袋子里，同时低声说着他认为可能是英语的话。当与他四目相对时，那位陌生人停止了歌唱，平静地微笑着，转身朝他的方向走来。

Shinji's teeth ground in frustration.  
真嗣懊恼地咬紧牙关。

The music was being played so loudly in the small device that even from a distance the youth was able to hear heavy guitar riffs and what he assumed was a male voice. Determined to not interact with him at all, Shinji chose to glare at the reflection of the moon and not at him, even as he felt the grass a few feet from him ruffle and give under as the man plopped down next to him without a care in the world. Instead of speaking or clarifying why he was there, sitting beside him at all, the stranger's head continued to move in tune with the piece; he entertained himself with analyzing the freshly picked fruits more thoroughly as he hummed.  
音乐在小设备中播放得如此之大，以至于即便相隔一段距离，青年也能清晰听到沉重的吉他 riff 和他猜测是男声的歌声。决心不与对方有任何交流，真嗣选择凝视月亮的倒影而非他，即便他感觉到几英尺外的草丛因那人无所顾忌地坐下而轻轻摇曳。陌生人并未开口解释为何会坐在他身旁，而是继续随着音乐节奏摇头晃脑；他自顾自地更仔细地研究着刚摘的水果，同时哼唱着。

Every now and then, when the stranger caught him stealing a furtive glance, he'd grin as though they were friends or close relatives. Shinji noticed he had what appeared to be green eyes and a tanned skin hue; unlike Kaji, the man kept his long, shoulder-length hair loose. He looked foreign, a complexion he had not yet come across, and his constant smiling and apparent joy with the simple task of inspecting limes worked to anger Shinji more and more.  
每当那陌生人捕捉到他偷偷一瞥时，便会咧嘴一笑，仿佛他们是朋友或近亲。真嗣注意到他似乎有着绿色的眼睛和晒黑的皮肤色调；与加持不同，这个男人让他的长发披散至肩。他看起来像个外国人，这种肤色真嗣还未曾见过，而他对于检查酸橙这样简单任务的持续微笑和明显愉悦，越发激怒了真嗣。

After what felt like too long, and just when the discomfort was making him consider going back to the house, Shinji cleared his throat. "Uhm, who are you?"  
在感觉似乎过了太久之后，就在不适感让他考虑返回屋内时，真嗣清了清嗓子。“呃，你是谁？”

He heard the click when the music player was stopped. "Hmm?" The stranger removed one of the earbuds and gave him a curious glance. "I'm sorry?"  
他听到音乐播放器停止时的咔嗒声。“嗯？”陌生人摘下一只耳塞，好奇地看了他一眼。“对不起，你说什么？”

The disquiet rang loudly in his voice, despite Shinji's best efforts to remain polite and civil. "Who are you?"  
尽管真嗣尽力保持礼貌和文明，但他的不安在声音中显得格外明显。“你是谁？”

Addressing him with a raised eyebrow, the man chuckled and motioned towards the tress. "You're the one sitting in my favorite spot, and I'm not asking you who _you_ are," he rebuked, snickering even louder. Before Shinji could recover, he continued. "Doesn't matter who I am, does it?" A plastic bottle filled with a cold liquid was placed before him. "I'm just a friendly stranger. Here, have some lemonade, it's good for you."  
那人挑起眉毛，轻笑一声，指了指树丛。“你坐在我最喜欢的地方，而我并没有问你是谁，”他反驳道，笑声更大了。没等真嗣反应过来，他继续说道：“我是谁并不重要，对吧？”一瓶装满冰凉液体的塑料瓶摆在他面前。“我只是个友好的陌生人。来，喝点柠檬水，对你有好处。”

It would seem the stranger was more than content with ignoring Shinji; he took out the small music player, which the boy recognized as an even older version than his SDAT, rewound the tape and pressed play. Silence fell upon them; each second in the presence of the odd man made the pressure in his chest extend and become stifling. There was a sudden compulsion to get it out, to expel whatever bile had been building in his chest.  
看来这位陌生人对于无视真嗣感到十分满意；他掏出了一个小型音乐播放器，真嗣认出那比自己的 SDAT 还要老旧的版本，倒带后按下了播放键。四周陷入了沉默；每在那个古怪男人身边多待一秒，胸中的压迫感就愈发沉重，令人窒息。突然间，有种强烈的冲动想要宣泄出来，将胸中积聚的苦涩尽数吐出。

"I don't know what to do," he revealed. The man did not much react other than a curious glance as he inspected the limes and lemons. "Everybody smiles at me like I did something to deserve it." His glare on the moon's reflection returned, stronger than before. He could not possibly say these things to Toji, let alone Asuka. Toji had simply discarded the statement, and Asuka would most likely sneer and reprimand him. "I don't. I wish they would all just stop."  
“我不知道该怎么办，”他坦白道。那人除了好奇地瞥了一眼，并没有太多反应，他正在检查青柠和柠檬。“每个人都对我微笑，好像我做了什么值得的事。”他再次盯着月亮的倒影，目光比之前更加强烈。他不可能对真嗣说这些，更不用说明日香了。真嗣只会置之不理，而明日香很可能会嗤之以鼻并训斥他。“我不。我希望他们全都停止。”

Pungent, honest laughter reverberated through the trees; with a slap on his thigh, whoever this person was regarded him with a relaxed, inquisitive expression. "You want people to stop smiling? Don't you think that's weirdly messed up?"  
辛辣、坦率的笑声在树间回荡；那人拍了拍大腿，带着一种放松、好奇的表情看着他。“你想让人们停止微笑？你不觉得这很奇怪吗？”

_This person is making me angry._ "I don't want them to stop smiling altogether," clarified the Third Child in a strained whisper. "I just don't understand why they smile at me at all."  
这个人让我生气。“我不是想让他们完全停止微笑，”第三适格者用压抑的低语澄清道。“我只是不明白他们为什么对我微笑。”

"Maybe it's because you feel like you don't deserve those smiles, right?" A lemon was cut in half with a small knife; the stranger offered one half to Shinji and devoured his without hesitation. Shinji, for his part, stared at the diced fruit before venturing to nibble on it, shocked to find it not as bitter as expected. "Yeah, I know the feeling, at least a little of it. So, tell me." The blonde threw the emptied fruit onto the water. "Doesn't it make you want to start trying to earn those smiles? Certainly did with me."  
"或许是因为你觉得你不配得到那些笑容，对吧？" 一把小刀将柠檬切成两半；陌生人递给真嗣一半，自己则毫不犹豫地吃掉了另一半。真嗣盯着切好的水果，小心翼翼地咬了一口，惊讶地发现它并没有预期的那么苦。"嗯，我懂那种感觉，至少懂一点。所以，告诉我。" 金发男子将吃剩的果皮扔进水里。"这不让你想要开始努力赢得那些笑容吗？确实让我有了这样的想法。"

"I don't want to earn them, I don't want to receive them," he muttered bitterly as he sank his head deeper into his legs. "I don't want to do _anything_."  
"我不想赢得它们，我不想接受它们，" 他苦涩地低声说，将头更深地埋进双腿之间。"我什么都不想做。"

The sound of a bottle being opened permeated the night air; the stranger drank long from his own bottle, sighing in relief and contentment once he was done. "Anything. Hmm, yeah. I remember a time when I didn't want to do anything. How's that working out for you so far, you know, this not doing anything?"  
夜空中回荡着开瓶的声音；陌生人从自己的瓶中畅饮，喝完后长舒一口气，满是解脱与满足。“任何事。嗯，是的。我记得有段时间我什么都不想做。你这样什么都不做，到目前为止感觉如何？”

_No,_ he thought with despair climbing into his awareness. _Nothing works out, I don't - there's no possible way I can ever make amends._ "Not very well, I suppose," he confessed at last, defeated and suddenly very thirsty. "Nothing really works."  
不，他绝望地意识到。一切都不会顺利，我做不到——我永远无法弥补。“我想，不太好吧，”他最终坦白道，感到挫败且突然非常口渴。“真的没什么能顺利。”

He took the bottle laying by his side and took four gulps of delicious, fresh lemonade. He wanted to laugh all of the sudden, but the energy to do so was absent. After being surrounded by ghosts from the past wearing familiar faces and warmly welcoming him into their home, he was now venting to a complete stranger. The faint sound of a third pair of footsteps alerted him, yet before he could look behind him, the visitor spoke.  
他拿起身边的瓶子，连喝了四口美味新鲜的柠檬水。突然间他想大笑，却没有那份力气。在经历了被过去幽灵般熟悉的面孔包围并热情欢迎回家后，他现在正向一个完全陌生的人倾诉。微弱的第三双脚步声引起了他的注意，然而在他回头之前，来访者已经开口。

"Well if you don't do anything, you can't expect a thing to change. I learned that taking care of these trees." He motioned towards the lush patch of forest surrounding them. "Sometimes, when a tree's growing, the best thing to do is to do nothing. You're supposed to let the roots sink into the soil and let the little sprout gain strength."  
"嗯，如果你什么都不做，就不能指望事情会有所改变。我是在照顾这些树时学会的。" 他指向周围郁郁葱葱的森林。"有时候，树在生长时，最好的办法就是什么也不做。你应该让树根扎进土壤，让小嫩芽积蓄力量。"

A gloved finger pointed towards a small, particularly crooked and feeble-looking tree. "But if you do nothing at all, if you don't remove the weeds, clear off the dead leaves or sick branches or protect them from disease or plagues, then the tree will grow weak, and crooked." Even when he refused to look at him, Shinji felt the man's gaze fix on him next. "You don't really have to do much, it would surprise you how far small actions can go, sometimes."  
一只戴着手套的手指向一棵特别弯曲且看起来虚弱的树。"但如果你完全什么都不做，不去除杂草，清理枯叶或病枝，或者保护它们免受疾病和虫害，那么树就会变得虚弱，扭曲。" 即使他没有看向他，真嗣也能感觉到那人的目光紧盯着他。"你其实不需要做太多，有时候，小小的行动能带来意想不到的效果。"

"You don't get it," Shinji bit back, shaking his head. "Every time I try to do something, everybody I care about gets hurt, _everybody_!" he heaved; the image of Asuka's choker came to mind and made the guilt become almost unbearable. "So why should I try doing anything at all, anymore?"  
"你不懂，" 真嗣反驳道，摇着头。"每次我试图做些什么，我关心的人都会受伤，所有人！" 他喘息着；明日香项圈的画面浮现在脑海，让愧疚感几乎难以承受。"那我为什么还要继续尝试做任何事呢？"

"I see, so." Another lemon was sliced in half and consumed, the peels fell in the water in a quick succession. "You _don't_ want things to change. Are you happy with the way things are? Happy with those smiles you mentioned? Doesn't sound like that to me."  
"我明白了，那么。" 另一片柠檬被切成两半并吃掉，果皮迅速落入水中。"你不想让事情改变。你对现状满意吗？对你提到的那些笑容满意吗？在我听来并非如此。"

Shinji sighed in utter frustration. He was going in circles with this stranger now, leading to nowhere but a greater headache. "No." The word was spat out more than spoken, filled with every bit of self-hatred he had developed ever since being salvaged from Unit 01. "I'm not."  
真嗣长叹一声，满是沮丧。他现在和这个陌生人兜圈子，除了加剧头痛，别无进展。“不。”这个词与其说是说出来的，不如说是吐出来的，充满了自被从初号机中救出以来积累的所有自我憎恨。“我不是。”

The bag filled with ripe limes was placed next to the bottle, forcing Shinji to lift his head in surprise. "Would you like to earn those smiles, then? Or are you happy just doing nothing?"  
装满成熟青柠的袋子被放在瓶子旁边，迫使真嗣惊讶地抬起头来。“那么，你想赢得那些笑容吗？还是你只满足于无所事事？”

"What if I end up hurting them again?" _What if I hurt Asuka, or Toji, or Hikari or their child? What if I hurt this place more than I already have?_ The thought of doing anything at all was slowly becoming terrifying.  
"如果我又伤害了他们怎么办？" 如果我伤害了明日香，或是真嗣，或是光，或是他们的孩子？如果我给这个地方带来的伤害比已经造成的还要多怎么办？一想到要做任何事情，就慢慢变得令人恐惧。

"You might think it's too late, but it's not." The blonde's gloved hand patted the bag of limes with fondness. "I thought it was too late once. Couldn't eat, couldn't sleep for days. Weeks. Then I came here, and they started smiling at me, as well. I remember thinking 'why would they?' It pissed me off. I spent every day barely moving, barely breathing."  
"你可能觉得太晚了，但其实不然。" 金发男子戴着皮手套的手亲切地拍了拍那袋青柠。"我曾经也以为太晚了。连续几天，甚至几周，吃不下，睡不着。后来我来到这里，他们开始对我微笑，我也记得当时在想'他们为什么要这样？' 这让我很恼火。我每天几乎一动不动，几乎不呼吸。"

He produced yet another healthy fruit from his pocket. "Then I heard somebody say the village needed someone who knew of botany. I'm not an expert, but my brother did teach me how to grow things and survive. I started trying to grow fruit trees of all kinds, to try and boost the immune system of the population. Took me a few years, but it paid off." Their eyes met, and Shinji felt a rare, overwhelming sense of kinship with this rare person sitting beside him. "I didn't start with the whole forest, though. I started with a single sprout, then two, then three, and so on."  
他又从口袋里掏出一个健康的水果。"后来我听到有人说村子需要一个懂植物学的人。我不是专家，但我哥哥教过我如何种植和生存。我开始尝试种植各种果树，试图增强居民的免疫系统。花了几年时间，但最终有了回报。" 他们的目光相遇，真嗣感到一种难得的、强烈的与这位稀有人物之间的共鸣。"不过，我并不是一开始就种了整片森林。我是从一棵幼苗开始的，然后是两棵，三棵，如此这般。"

"I don't think anything can ever take back the things I've done," Shinji said after a few moments of silence.  
“我不认为有什么能挽回我所做的一切，”沉默片刻后，真嗣说道。

The stranger laughed heartedly once more. "And you think I plant and care for these trees and plants to take back what I've done? No, I know I can never take that back, I can never take back the bad and twisted things I did. What I can do, however," seemingly unaware that Shinji was not appreciative of personal contact, he pressed a hand against his shoulder, "is try to bring some goodness into the world, in any small way that I can. That, I think, is what real redemption is. It's never too late to stop running, never too late to stop apologizing, it's never too late to stop hurting people. Start _helping_ people, Shinji." The boy's eyes widened at the mention of his name. "Just a little bit, and when next you notice, you'll be doing things you thought were impossible."  
陌生人再次爽朗地笑了起来。“你以为我种这些树和植物是为了挽回我所做的一切吗？不，我知道我永远无法挽回那些坏事和扭曲的行为。然而，我能做的，”他似乎没意识到真嗣不喜欢身体接触，把手搭在他的肩膀上，“就是尽力为这个世界带来一些美好，无论多么微小。我认为，这才是真正的救赎。停止逃避永远不会太晚，停止道歉永远不会太晚，停止伤害他人永远不会太晚。开始帮助他人，真嗣。”听到自己的名字，男孩的眼睛睁大了。“只要一点点，当你再次注意到时，你会发现自己在做那些曾经认为不可能的事情。”

A second bottle was pressed against his arm. "Here." The man rose, leaving the bag of ripe of fruit and the two bottles with him. "For your friend." As he walked away and the cryptic words hung heavily in the air, the stranger motioned towards the spring and the trees. "Feel free to come here any time you want. It's nice and quiet, helps you think. Your friend is welcome, too."  
第二瓶酒被塞到他手中。“给。”那人起身，留下一袋熟透的水果和两瓶酒给他。“给你朋友。”他边走边说，留下那句隐晦的话在空气中沉甸甸的，陌生人则示意他看向泉水和树木。“随时欢迎你来这里，这里宁静宜人，有助于思考。你朋友也欢迎。”

Shinji realized the stranger had not only left two bottles of fresh lemonade with him, but also the larger portion of the limes he had been collecting, and before he could shout or pursue him to give back the heavy package, the figure had already faded through the dense forest. "Your…" he said to nobody in particular. There was a slight rustling behind him, the scent of LCL and strawberries assaulted his nostrils, making Shinji's shoulders drop. "Hey, Asuka."  
碇真嗣意识到那位陌生人不仅给他留下了两瓶新鲜的柠檬水，还有他一直在收集的大部分青柠，而他还没来得及大喊或追赶上去归还那个沉重的包裹，那身影就已经消失在茂密的森林中。“你……”他对着空无一人的地方说道。身后传来轻微的沙沙声，LCL 和草莓的气味扑鼻而来，让真嗣的肩膀不由得垂下。“嘿，明日香。”

"Are you done moping?" spat out the redhead, who had long since stood a few feet away from him, resting on one of the larger trees. She walked a few steps closer to him. "Or are you planning to take a dive in that puddle? It's not even deep enough for you to drown in, in case you're wondering."  
“你发完牢骚了吗？”红发的少女早已站在几英尺外，倚靠在一棵大树上，她向他走近了几步。“还是你打算在那水坑里跳下去？别担心，那水坑连让你淹死都不够深。”

Feeling the rough material of the bag between his fingers, Shinji occupied himself with placing both bottles in it as he slowly got to his feet; his eyes drifted to the bloodied moon for a last time. _I just wanted some time to think,_ he thought, slightly annoyed, but then sighed and nodded; tired as he was, with the antibiotic ceasing its dulling effect, the tremors were slowly beginning to manifest. _Then again, I'm a prisoner. She's right, I haven't done anything to earn that permission._  
手指间感受着袋子粗糙的质地，真嗣一边将两瓶药放入其中，一边缓缓站起身来；他的目光最后一次飘向那染血的月亮。我只是想有些时间思考，他想，略感烦躁，但随即叹了口气并点头；尽管疲惫不堪，随着抗生素的镇痛效果逐渐消失，颤抖开始慢慢显现。不过，我是个囚犯。她说得对，我什么都没做来赢得那份许可。

"If you know the way back, I'm leaving. If you don't, I'm still leaving, so tag along or stay here and freeze, your choice." Asuka began to walk away in her usual hasty pace, forcing Shinji to ponder which the lesser evil was, staying there near the spring, or going back to the house. The footsteps halted, a heavy intake of breath, and then her voice rang through the still of the night. "_Move_, Shinji."  
“如果你知道回去的路，我就走了。如果不知道，我还是会走，所以跟上或者留在这里挨冻，你自己选。”明日香开始以她一贯的急促步伐离开，迫使真嗣思考留在泉水附近和返回房子哪个更糟糕。脚步停下，深吸一口气，然后她的声音划破了夜的寂静。“走吧，真嗣。”

That he remembered, it was the first time Asuka called him by his name without adding a 'Baka' or a 'brat' next to it. Blessedly enough, his hazed mind was clear enough to acknowledge the fact at that moment, which forced his limbs to function despite the shakes and pain and pick the bag. He followed soon after her, and despite her earlier warning of leaving him behind, Asuka walked just fast enough for him to tag along behind the green jacket.  
那是他记得的，第一次，明日香叫了他的名字，没有加上“笨蛋”或“小鬼”之类的词。幸运的是，他那混沌的头脑在那一刻足够清醒，意识到这个事实，尽管颤抖和疼痛，还是强迫自己行动起来，捡起了包。他紧随其后，尽管她之前警告过会丢下他，明日香还是走得足够慢，让他能跟在绿色夹克后面。

He memorized the way into the strange patch of forest without meaning to; the small haven was but a few minutes away from the house, a trail relatively easy to find meandered from the house all the way to the greenery. At some point the redhead's pace slowed; once he was within earshot, Shinji ventured to ask. "Uhm, who was that person?"  
他无意间记住了通往那片陌生森林的路径；这片小避风港离房子不过几分钟路程，一条相对容易找到的小径蜿蜒从屋子一直延伸到绿意盎然之处。不知何时，红发少年的步伐放缓了；当他进入能听到的范围时，真嗣鼓起勇气问道。“呃，那个人是谁？”

"Go figure," responded the Major with irritation. "Nobody knows. He just showed up one day, about twelve years ago, covered in red sand and blood. Said he couldn't remember his name." As she walked, Asuka remembered the scarce occasion in which she would coincidentally be in the village and decide to visit the small forest. The stranger in question had never bothered to speak a word to her. "There was a V.K. on his vest, so people just call him Viko. He takes care of the citrus trees."  
"真是莫名其妙，"少校带着恼怒回应道，"没人知道他的来历。大约十二年前，他突然出现在这里，浑身沾满红沙和血迹，声称自己记不起名字了。" 她边走边回忆起那稀有的几次，她恰巧在村子里并决定去那片小树林看看。那个陌生人从未费心与她交谈过。"他背心上有个 V.K.的字样，所以人们就叫他维科。他负责照料那些柑橘树。"

"Oh," the bag held in his uninjured hand felt heavy; how many of the small fruits had the man just gifted him? "He seems… nice."  
“哦，”他未受伤的手中提着的袋子感觉沉甸甸的；那人刚送了他多少小果子呢？“他看起来……挺好的。”

No answer came from the Second Child; they continued to thread through the soft grass until the lights of the settlement became visible, and soon enough the house came into view. Before she opened the door, Asuka extended her hand and signaled to his bandaged wrist. "Let me see," she demanded. Shinji complied, averted his eyes from her and rolled up the jacket sleeve. Asuka wasted no time in snatching the wrist and holding it up against the dim moonlight. "Hmm, nothing but a bit of suppuration, should hold up fine until tomorrow." Her hold on the wrist loosened just a bit; the uncertainty manifested stronger than ever. "Get inside. KenKen's home, go make him some food. Make yourself useful."  
二号机没有回应；他们继续穿过柔软的草地，直到聚居地的灯光映入眼帘，不久房屋也出现在视野中。在她开门之前，明日香伸出手，示意他包扎的手腕。“让我看看，”她命令道。真嗣顺从地移开视线，卷起夹克袖子。明日香毫不犹豫地抓住他的手腕，在昏暗的月光下仔细检查。“嗯，只是有点化脓，应该能撑到明天。”她握住手腕的力度稍稍放松；不安感比以往任何时候都要强烈。“进去吧。剑剑在家，去给他做点吃的。让自己有点用处。”

Her statement felt like nothing short of an order, so Shinji nodded, hid away the bandage with the jacket sleeve and stepped into the house, where the tech enthusiast was still picking apart the computer mainframe. For a moment he expected Asuka to follow him, yet apparently the redhead was more than comfortable standing outside and glaring at the dark surroundings.  
她的话听起来完全像是在下命令，所以真嗣点点头，用夹克袖子遮住绷带，走进屋内，那位科技爱好者还在拆解电脑主机。有那么一会儿，他以为明日香会跟着进来，但显然红发女孩更愿意站在外面，瞪着黑暗的四周。

"Ikari, hey!" the elder man greeted as he rose from the table and came to stand next to him. "It's good to see you up and about," he commented with a grin. "It's surely been a while, huh?"  
"碇，嘿！" 年长者从桌边站起身，走到他旁边打招呼。"看到你能起来走动真是太好了，"他笑着说。"确实有一阵子没见了，对吧？"

"H-hi, Kensuke," desperate to both rid himself of the amiable stare of his former schoolmate and the memory of Asuka calling him 'KenKen', Shinji averted his eyes and focused them on the kitchen area. 'H-Hokari gave me some ingredients, and I," he motioned to the heavy bag held in his palm. "I think I could cook something. Are you hungry?"  
"嗨，健介，" 为了摆脱昔日同学友好的目光，以及明日香称他为'健健'的记忆，真嗣移开视线，专注于厨房区域。"霍卡里给了我一些食材，我，"他示意手中沉甸甸的袋子。"我想我可以做点什么。你饿了吗？"

"Always," the village 'leader' motioned towards the larger stove located just outside the small cot. "Remember how to make a fire? I'm afraid we're gonna have to save up the gas until tomorrow morning. We'll just get the hot coals and move them inside."  
"总是饿的，" 村里的'领袖'指向位于小屋外的大炉子。"还记得怎么生火吗？恐怕我们得节省燃气到明天早上。我们只需取些热炭搬进屋里。"

Shinji went about the task of forming a small pyramid of wood and filling it with small, balled up pieces of paper. He could not help but relax as they build up a small pyre, with not a word spoken. Kensuke seemed to be quite at ease with silence, and did not press him for conversation or drone on about details concerning the village. He was happy to provide minimal instructions and soon, under his placid, patient instruction the fire was ignited. Once the wood burned to a satisfactory level, they carefully carried the cinders to a stove sitting outside the kitchen.  
真嗣着手搭建一个小木堆，并将揉成团的纸屑填入其中。随着他们默默地堆砌起这个小柴堆，他不禁感到放松。剑介似乎对沉默颇为自在，并未催促他交谈或喋喋不休地谈论村庄的细节。他乐于提供最简短的指示，很快，在他的平静耐心指导下，火被点燃了。待木柴燃烧到令人满意的程度后，他们小心翼翼地将灰烬搬到厨房外的一个炉子旁。

"That way the heat's transported inside without the need of all that smoke, see," Aida clarified as he fed fresh wind to the flames with a fan. "Next time you feel like cooking something, just remember to do this and you don't have to worry about running out of gas or anything. I built this this thing with the idea of not having my house smell like charcoal every time I get hungry."  
“这样热量就能直接传到里面，不需要那么多烟了，明白吗？”艾达一边解释，一边用扇子给火焰扇风。“下次你想做饭时，记得这样做，就不用担心煤气用完之类的问题了。我做这个东西就是为了让家里不再每次饿了都弥漫着炭火味。”

"Right," Shinji blinked, for once realizing how intricate the device actually was. "Wait, you built this?"  
“原来如此，”真嗣眨了眨眼，这才意识到这个装置其实非常复杂。“等等，这是你做的？”

"Sure did, shower too, and I'm trying to get an old car working again," Kensuke shrugged, grinning. "I like to be busy. Well, this looks just about ready, let's go back inside. You said you wanted to cook something, right?"  
“当然，淋浴器也是，我还在试着修一辆旧车，”健介耸耸肩，笑着说。“我喜欢忙忙碌碌。好了，看起来差不多了，我们回屋里去吧。你不是说要做什么菜吗？”

Shinji's gaze drifted towards the mane of golden-red visible under the moonlight. "Uhm, what about Asuka?"  
真嗣的目光飘向月光下那抹金红色的鬃毛。“呃，那明日香呢？”

_Hear that, Major? Broken as he is, he's asking about you. Hell, I_ _**know**_ _you heard that._ "She'll come in when she feels like it," Aida elucidated with a shrug, and pointed to the bowl resting on the table. "You said Hikari made that? Ah, man! Finally, some decent grub. What were you planning to cook, anyway, Ikari? I remember those bentos from the aquarium." Kensuke stole a glance at Shikinami and grinned.  
听到了吗，少校？即使他如此破碎，还在询问你。见鬼，我知道你听到了。“她想进来的时候自然会进来，”相田解释道，耸了耸肩，指着桌上的碗。“你说这是光做的？啊，老兄！终于有点像样的食物了。你原本打算做什么，真嗣？我记得水族馆那些便当。”健介偷瞄了一眼式波，咧嘴笑了。

"I... was just thinking of maybe condensing the stew a bit more, and adding some fresh herbs I found in the morning, a-and a bit of lemon peel. Might add some flavor." Shinji did not much wait for permission to start; as soon as he felt the stove heated, the boy set about cutting up some limes and adding the fresh peel to the stew. Hikari's words rang loud in his mind, not unlike Asuka's own orders had forced him to eat, shower, and continue existing.  
"我...只是想着或许可以把炖菜再浓缩一点，然后加入早上发现的新鲜香草，还有一点柠檬皮。可能会增添些风味。" 真嗣并没有等待许可就开始行动；一感觉到炉子热了，他就着手切起酸橙，将新鲜果皮加入炖菜中。美里的话在他脑海中回响，与明日香自己的命令强迫他进食、洗澡、继续存在的感觉如出一辙。

The cap rested on top of the table, opposite to where Kensuke chose to sit whilst he continued to extract salvable pieces from the mainframe. "The roundels are nice, aren't they?" he commented off-handedly; Shinji had just stolen a fourth furtive glance at it, after all. "You like 'em?"  
帽子静静地搁在桌子的另一端，与健介选择坐下的位置相对。他正继续从主机中拆出可用的部件。“那些圆徽挺不错的，对吧？”他随口评论道；毕竟，真嗣已经偷偷瞥了它第四眼。“你喜欢它们吗？”

With the boy's back to him, he could not truly tell if Shinji reacted to the question or not, other than the way his shoulders stiffened for a second. "I think I like the red one," he admitted quietly, careful to only let Kensuke hear the admission. "It's like a pirate, right?"  
男孩背对着他，他无法真正判断真嗣是否对这个问题有所反应，除了他的肩膀僵硬了一秒钟。“我觉得我喜欢红色的那个，”他轻声承认，小心翼翼地只让剑介听到这个秘密。“像海盗，对吧？”

"Yeah," the man's eyes drifted to the spot where he knew Asuka to be eavesdropping. "Like an angry pirate flag." Every few minutes, Kensuke went to feed the stove outside, and every time he came back inside the smell of the stew grew more irresistible. He was immensely happy to see Shinji at least move with some sense of coordination, even happier to see him cook and respond, albeit slowly, to his infrequent questions. Before he knew it, there was a hefty serving of stew, diced protein bars, and a glass of fresh lemonade before him.  
“是啊，”男人的目光飘向他知道明日香在偷听的地方。“像一面愤怒的海盗旗。”每隔几分钟，剑介就会去给外面的炉子加料，每次他回到屋内，炖菜的香味就变得更加诱人。他非常高兴看到真嗣至少能有些协调地移动，更高兴看到他做饭并缓慢地回应他偶尔的问题。不知不觉间，他面前摆上了一大份炖菜、切碎的蛋白质条和一杯新鲜的柠檬水。

"Ah, look at this!" He abandoned the task of retrieving a chip from the mainframe and dug into the stew with gusto. "Thanks for the meal! Hey, you're not eating?" The food tasted fresh; it was warm, welcoming and familiar, like a hug from a relative. Kensuke almost forgot he was supposed to make sure it was Shinji who ate, and not him. "Ikari?"  
“啊，看看这个！”他放弃了从主机中取芯片的任务，热情地大口吃起炖菜来。“谢谢你的饭！嘿，你不吃吗？”食物尝起来很新鲜；它是温暖的，热情而熟悉，就像来自亲人的拥抱。剑介几乎忘了他应该确保是真嗣在吃，而不是他。“碇？”

The Third child was halfway out the door, he noticed, carrying a tray. _Ah, but of course,_ mused Aida, smiling though bites. _Ladies first, of course, of course. Damn, this is good food._ "Never mind," he said with a wide grin, devouring another spoonful. "Shikinami doesn't eat much," he lied, knowing well of her condition and general opinion of food. His eyes fixed on Shinji's detached gaze. "Try and change that for me, will you?"  
第三个孩子正端着托盘走到门口，他注意到。啊，当然，艾达边咀嚼边微笑着沉思。女士优先，当然，当然。该死，这食物真好吃。“没关系，”他咧嘴笑着说，又吞下一勺。“式波吃得不多，”他撒谎道，深知她的状况和对食物的一般看法。他的目光锁定在真嗣那茫然的眼神上。“试着为我改变这一点，好吗？”

The door opened and closed, allowing Kensuke to breathe a big sigh of relief and sink into his chair, stretching. "Jeez," he stared at ceiling; despite the stressful air around the house, he could not help but feel oddly optimistic. "Look at you, Aida. Babysitting the married couple, who would've thought." He patted his full stomach, and went about taking off the vest and body suit. Asuka had never bothered to hide the choker, and now she was wearing a scarf; she had even parted with that red jacket she seemed so fond of. "What do you think, old man? Did I do right, so far?"  
门开了又关，让健介得以长舒一口气，瘫坐在椅子上伸展身体。“天哪，”他盯着天花板；尽管屋内弥漫着紧张的气氛，他却忍不住感到一种莫名的乐观。“瞧瞧你，相田，居然成了那对新婚夫妇的保姆，谁想得到呢。”他拍了拍鼓起的肚子，开始脱下背心和紧身衣。明日香从未费心隐藏过项圈，如今却围上了围巾；她甚至舍弃了那件似乎很喜欢的红色夹克。“你觉得呢，老头子？到目前为止，我做得对吗？”

---

"I don't want it." "我不想要。"

Shinji paused by the door, eyes drawing over to the woods. "I though you might be h-"  
真嗣在门口停下，目光转向树林。“我以为你可能会饿——”

"Not hungry. I told you I wasn't a few hours ago. Still not hungry now." With her arms crossed and back pressed against the wall, Asuka chose to glare at the wooden wall to her left, trying to ignore how the scent of the stew made its way to her nostrils. "Stop wasting time and food, brat. Just eat and go to sleep."  
"不饿。几个小时前我就告诉过你了。现在还是不饿。" 明日香双臂交叉，背靠墙壁，瞪着左边的木墙，试图忽略炖菜的香味如何飘进她的鼻孔。"别浪费时间和食物了，小鬼。快吃然后去睡觉。"

Shinji scowled at the stew and the bottle of lemonade, wishing for nothing else than to lay by the cot and ignore both Asuka and Kensuke. Cooking had been unexpected, even asking to do so had come as a surprise; why were Hikari's words resonating in his head with such frequency? "Hokari-san made this," he commented, and walked a few steps in her direction. "There's fresh lemonade, as well," he added quietly. _It's good for you,_ the stranger mentioned with a smile. "It's, uh, good for you."  
真嗣对着炖菜和柠檬汽水皱了皱眉，只希望能躺在床边，不理会明日香和剑介。做饭这件事出乎意料，甚至主动提出做饭也让人惊讶；为什么光的话会在他脑海中如此频繁地回响？“这是光做的，”他评论道，并向她的方向走了几步。“还有新鲜的柠檬汽水，”他轻声补充道。那个陌生人微笑着提到：“这对身体有好处。”“呃，对身体有好处。”

Keeping the nature of her sickness away from him became increasingly difficult, especially when the brat insisted on wasting valuable lilim resource on her. The memory of the times at school and the apartment kept her from reacting with a yell or grunt; added to the latest pang of guilt driven from her violent behavior only hours prior, Asuka felt almost unable to reject the small peace offering Shinji carried.  
将她的病情对他隐瞒变得越来越困难，尤其是当那小子坚持要浪费宝贵的莉莉姆资源在她身上时。学校和公寓的时光回忆让她无法以尖叫或呻吟来回应；再加上几小时前因暴力行为而产生的最新一阵内疚感，明日香几乎无法拒绝真嗣带来的那点微薄的和解之礼。

"Good for me, sure, like you know anything." Asuka sneered at the food, gulped down exactly half of the stew without minding to taste it or worry if it was hot at all, took the lemonade and emptied it, slamming the bottle on the tray and signaling to both the rations and the bowl. "There. Now eat the rest, brat. And take the stupid antibiotic."  
"对我有好处，当然，好像你懂什么似的。" 明日香对食物嗤之以鼻，不加品尝也不顾是否烫口，咕咚咕咚喝掉半碗炖菜，拿起柠檬水一饮而尽，砰地一声将瓶子砸在托盘上，示意剩下的口粮和碗。"好了。现在把剩下的吃了，小鬼。还有，把那该死的抗生素也吃了。"

It took her by surprise how Shinji did not much complain about her command, and did as he was told. He ate the rest of the stew, the entire portion of rations and drank from his own lemonade bottle, pausing to take the antibiotic with the last remnants of his drink. _He looks even more lucid than a few hours ago,_ she realized. _I thought I tasted some… lime peel? Impossible. Those are just memories of how things used to taste. Remember that. You can't_ _**really**_ _taste anything, anymore, Asuka. Just flashes, snippets, that's all you have._  
这让她有些意外，真嗣并没有太多抱怨她的命令，而是乖乖照做了。他吃完了剩下的炖菜，整份口粮，还从自己的柠檬水瓶里喝了几口，最后用剩下的饮料吞下了抗生素。她发现，他看起来甚至比几个小时前还要清醒。我刚才尝到了一些……柠檬皮的味道？不可能。那只是过去味道的记忆罢了。记住这一点。你已经无法真正品尝到任何东西了，明日香。只有闪现，片段，这就是你仅有的。

She waited for Shinji to leave, not saying another word and pocketing her hands in the jacket. Her eye drifted to the moon, so as to remind herself of the grim reality she lived in and erase the memories of schoolyards, banter, and warm food. _Stupid brat probably hasn't even thought of what I asked him, weak as he is._ A heated remark was about to make its way out her mouth when Shinji's soft voice hinged her jaw closed.  
她等着真嗣离开，一言不发，双手插进夹克口袋。目光飘向月亮，以此提醒自己所处的严峻现实，抹去校园、闲聊和热食的记忆。那蠢小子大概连我问他的事都没想过，真是软弱。一句尖锐的话即将脱口而出，却被真嗣柔和的声音堵了回去。

"I think I understand, a little," he said, head bowed and tone somber. "It was my inaction, whether to help you, or to kill you. Had I… chosen to do something, then maybe things would have been different." _Never too late to stop apologizing._ "I'd like to apologize, but I realize that won't help at all." The boy's hand paused on the doorknob; a scream assaulted his senses, a memory manifested so suddenly he almost dropped the tray and tripped. "I thought I'd never see you again. I thought you were gone, forever, and then… I think I heard you say something."  
"我想我有点明白了，"他低着头，语气沉重地说道。"是我的不作为，无论是帮助你，还是杀了你。如果我……选择了做些什么，也许情况就会不同。"停止道歉永远不会太晚。"我想道歉，但我知道那一点用也没有。"男孩的手在门把手上停顿了一下；一声尖叫侵袭了他的感官，一段记忆如此突然地显现，他几乎摔掉了托盘，差点绊倒。"我以为再也见不到你了。我以为你永远消失了，然后……我想我听到你说什么了。"

"What?" Asuka barked back, arms tightening around her midsection and pretending Shinji had not just rationalized one of the core reasons behind her anger with him. "What the hell are you talking about?"  
"什么？"明日香厉声回道，双臂紧紧抱住自己的腹部，假装真嗣没有刚刚合理化她对他愤怒的核心原因之一。"你到底在说什么鬼话？"

"Before I woke up in the Wunder. Is it called Wunder? I don't really remember," Shinji said, and for once, without him even noticing, a small smile drew over his lips. "I remember you telling me to do something, though. For so long, it was quiet, and then I heard you." His brow furrowed, trying to piece together the faint details if the event. "You told me to do something, so I did. I tried to do something."  
"在我醒来之前，是在 Wunder 上吗？是不是叫 Wunder 来着？我记不太清了。" 真嗣说道，而这一次，他甚至没有察觉到自己唇边浮现了一抹淡淡的微笑。"我只记得你让我做些什么，虽然很久以来都很安静，但后来我听到了你的声音。" 他皱起眉头，努力拼凑着那次事件的模糊细节。"你让我做些什么，所以我就去做了。我试着去做些什么。"

The reminiscence of the battle in space resurfaced; the way Unit 01's enclosure had cracked and the beam had destroyed the angel in seconds left the Second Child frowning into the grass, struggling for words. Was this idiot truly implying he had heard her?  
那场太空战斗的回忆再次浮现；零号机外壳的裂痕和光束在几秒内摧毁使徒的情景，让二号机驾驶员皱着眉头凝视草地，努力寻找言辞。这家伙真的是在暗示他听到了她的话吗？

Broken glass, a red jacket, a black cap and a flash of red; it all came back to him quite easily, the complete antithesis of everything that happened after Kaworu's death. "That Plugsuit, I remember it. It's the same you were wearing the first time we met."  
破碎的玻璃、红色夹克、黑色帽子和一抹红色；这一切都轻易地回到了他的记忆中，与渚薰死后发生的一切完全相反。“那件紧身衣，我记得。就是你第一次见到我时穿的那件。”

Asuka's eye widened, and for a third time, the wrath melted completely off her gaze.  
明日香的眼睛睁大了，第三次，怒火完全从她的目光中消融。

"I was so glad," Shinji revealed, daring a sideway glance in her direction. "I was so glad to see you."  
"我非常高兴，" 真嗣透露道，鼓起勇气向她那边瞥了一眼。"我非常高兴能见到你。"

She turned her head away, hiding her eye from him under a curtain of light crimson locks. She heard the doorknob croak as it opened, and something jumped out of her chest before she could properly hinge her mouth closed. "They told me you were gone."  
她转过头去，用一缕浅红色的发丝遮住了自己的眼睛，不让他看见。她听到门把手吱嘎作响，门被打开，心中涌起一股莫名的情绪，还没来得及合上嘴，就脱口而出："他们告诉我你已经不在了。"

Shinji's hand stopped cold. "W-What?"  
真嗣的手猛地僵住了。“什、什么？”

"They told me you were gone, Ritsuko gave a very detailed explanation of how in the midst of causing this Near Third Impact or whatever, you were turned to LCL and absorbed into Unit 01's core. About thirteen years ago, they told me you were nothing more than sludge swimming in the Eva's core."  
他们告诉我你已经不在了，律子给了我一个非常详细的解释，说在引发这个近似第三次冲击的过程中，你被转化成了 LCL，并被吸收进了零号机的核心。大约十三年前，他们告诉我你不过是混在 EVA 核心里的烂泥罢了。

The rails had felt especially cold that night, as she gazed into the skies and realized that she was risking her life for a fleeting memory and a spare battery for the Wunder. "Getting you back was never the objective, nor a priority. It was a mission to retrieve Unit 01." For whatever reason, the sight of Shinji's cut flashed through her mind, forcing a slight grimace out of her. "It was never expected that you'd be retrieved from the Eva."  
那晚的铁轨感觉格外冰冷，她凝视着天空，意识到自己正为了一段转瞬即逝的记忆和一个备用电池而冒生命危险。“让你回来从来不是目标，也不是优先事项。这是一次回收 01 号机体的任务。”不知为何，真嗣的伤口画面闪过脑海，让她不由得微微皱眉。“从未想过你会从 EVA 中被救出。”

_I was glad to see you, too, Baka-Shinji.  
我也很高兴见到你，笨蛋真嗣。_

"I wanted to deck you in the face the moment I saw you." Asuka produced a dry chuckle, yet no smirk reached her lips. "I suppose you understand why, now."  
“我一见到你就想揍你一拳。”明日香干笑了一声，但嘴角并未浮现出笑意。“现在，我想你应该明白原因了。”

"Yeah," The door opened; Shinji paused before walking in, lost in thought. He breathed in; Rei, Toji, Hikari, the villagers, the stranger, they all seemed quite willing to let him try. Maybe doing nothing was not truly what he wanted, after all. He could try, just a little bit. "I deserve more than a smack in the face."  
"嗯，"门开了；真嗣在走进去之前停顿了一下，陷入了沉思。他深吸一口气；绫波、阿薰、光、村民们、陌生人，他们都似乎很愿意让他尝试。也许什么都不做终究不是他真正想要的。他可以尝试，哪怕只是一点点。"我值得的不仅仅是被扇一巴掌。"

"I'll be the judge of that," she rebuked, shooing him away with her hand. "Go to sleep, brat. I don't want to know about you being sick, anymore."  
“我来判断这个，”她反驳道，用手挥赶他离开。“去睡觉，小鬼。我不想再听到你生病的事了。”

She stayed outside a few hours; every other moment, the lingering aftertaste of fresh lime would return, and Asuka would shake her head in derision, eye lost in the bloodied moon. "What an idiot." The little smile she had just seen; it reminded her of those smirks from long ago, those smiles at schools, the taste of food prepared exclusively for her. And now, fourteen years later, there was the idiot, offering her a bowl of stew.  
她在屋外待了几个小时；每隔一会儿，新鲜青柠的余味就会萦绕心头，明日香便会摇头自嘲，目光迷失在血色月亮中。“真是个傻瓜。”她刚刚看到的那个微笑；它让她想起了很久以前的那些讥笑，学校里的那些笑容，专为她准备的食物的味道。如今，十四年过去了，那个傻瓜端着一碗炖菜站在她面前。

The guilt of having almost force-fed him a second time with no need for it whatsoever settled on her stomach. What had he seen, anyway, to make him react to the choker in such a way? _Brat,_ she thought; her lips, nevertheless, recurred to an older, much more familiar word. She made sure he was well out of earshot before it escaped, ever so quietly, from her lips.  
那份因几乎无端再次强迫他而产生的愧疚沉甸甸地压在心头。他究竟看到了什么，才会对那项圈如此反应？她暗自骂了声“小鬼”，然而唇边却不自觉地浮现出一个更为久远、熟悉的词。她确保他已远到听不见时，才悄声吐出那个词。

"Baka." "笨蛋。"

Later that night, as she lay on the one available bed and pretended to sleep for the umpteenth time, Asuka's eye opened in surprise when she heard Shinji's voice ring across the room.  
那晚稍后，当她躺在唯一的一张床上，第无数次假装入睡时，听到真嗣的声音在房间里响起，明日香惊讶地睁开了眼睛。

"Uhm, Kensuke, are you awake?"  
“呃，健介，你醒着吗？”

"Hm? What?" the man answered, groggy and clearly awoken from a heavy slumber. "What's up, Ikari, did you need something?"  
"嗯？什么？" 男人回答道，声音含糊不清，显然是从沉睡中被唤醒。"怎么了，碇，你需要什么吗？"

A small pause; she tried to control her breathing enough to make it inaudible. "I... I wanted to ask you something."  
短暂的停顿；她试图控制呼吸，使其不被人察觉。"我...我想问你一件事。"

"Sure," Kensuke answered with a tired voice.  
"当然，" 健介用疲惫的声音回答道。"

"Is there anything… I mean, is there any job that I can do in the village?"  
“有什么……我是说，村里有什么我能做的工作吗？”

She heard the rustling of fabric as Kensuke rolled over to stare at Shinji in the eye. "I don't know if that's a good idea right now," he admitted. "Do you really feel like you're up for it? It's only been a few days, Ikari. I think it'd be best if you take it slow."  
她听到织物摩擦的声音，健介翻身盯着真嗣的眼睛。“我不知道现在是不是个好主意，”他承认道，“你真的觉得你能行吗？才过了几天，碇。我觉得你最好慢慢来。”

_What, so fourteen years isn't slow enough for you?_ She wanted to stand and scream it to both their faces, however, Shinji's next word kept her rooted to the mattress.  
什么，十四年还不够慢吗？她本想站起来对着他们俩大喊，然而，真嗣的下一句话让她牢牢地坐在床垫上。

"I don't really know what I want to do." The murmur reverberated through the room. "I just know I'd like to help. H-However I can."  
"我其实不太清楚自己想做什么。" 低语在房间里回荡。"我只知道我想帮忙。无论以何种方式。"

From the corner of her eye, Asuka saw Kensuke pat Shinji lightly on the shoulder. "Okay, if that's how you feel, I think we can find something for you in these days. Don't worry about it, we need every available pair of hands we can get. Now let's get some sleep, alright?"  
从眼角余光中，明日香看到真希波轻轻拍了拍真嗣的肩膀。"好吧，如果你这么想，我相信这几天我们能找到适合你的事情。别担心，我们需要每一个能动的手。现在去睡吧，好吗？"

"Ah, yeah. Sure, thank you, Kensuke."  
"啊，好的。当然，谢谢你，真希波。"

Soon enough, the breathing of both males became rhythmic and quiet, and she was left alone with her thoughts. _Pff, listen to that idiot, saying he wants to help. What's he gonna do, cook for the whole village or something?_  
不久，两人的呼吸变得有节奏且平静，她独自一人陷入了沉思。哼，听听那傻瓜的话，说要帮忙。他能做什么，给整个村子做饭还是怎么的？

Sleep never came, as per usual. The following morning, Asuka pretended to sleep as the sound of food being cooked and quiet conversation rose along with the sun, adamant on not interacting with either male for the remainder of the day. Her eye throbbed, as it always did, and the emptiness in her stomach never abated; the aches had grown so familiar she hardly ever thought of them. Dreams were scarce, and when they came, they were mostly reruns of her lonesome childhood, or the ever-familiar sensation of her body being torn to pieces along with the sound of the Entry Plug being crushed in Unit 01's jaw.  
一如既往，睡眠从未到来。第二天早上，明日香假装睡着，随着太阳升起，食物烹饪的声音和低声交谈响起，她坚决不与任何一位男性互动。她的眼睛一如既往地抽痛，胃里的空虚感从未减轻；这些疼痛变得如此熟悉，以至于她几乎不再去想它们。梦境稀少，当它们出现时，大多是孤独童年的重播，或是那种熟悉的、身体被撕裂的感觉，伴随着插入栓在零号机颚中被压碎的声音。

Once the house was empty and quiet, the Second Child rose from bed. Awaiting the next battle was all she had left, and with Unit 02 being repaired, there was little else she could do beside sit around and avoid being looked at by the villagers. She was about to walk outside and get some fresh air, yet the glistening of metal from the table made her pause.  
房子空无一人，寂静无声时，二号机驾驶员从床上起身。等待下一场战斗成了她仅剩的事，而零二号机正在修理，她除了坐着打发时间，避免被村民们注视外，别无他法。她正要走到外面呼吸新鲜空气，但桌子上金属的闪光让她停下了脚步。

There, sitting on the old table, was a worn-out, dented bento-box. The dictionary lay open on top of her jacket, with at leat one new word marked with a pen; Asuka decided to check on the book later, drawn by the scent coming from the small metal box.  
那是一个破旧、凹陷的便当盒，放在那张旧桌子上。字典摊开在她的夹克上，至少有一个新词用笔标记了出来；明日香决定稍后再查看这本书，她被那个小金属盒里飘出的香味吸引住了。

"This is a waste," Asuka repeated even as she sat on the table, took a spoon and began to eat from the cooked protein bars bathed in lime sauce and the concentrated stew. "Such a waste." Just as it had happened with the tea from the day before, her neurons began to associate the taste with events and experiences from the past, thus allowing her to actually taste the meal, in some sense.  
“这是浪费，”明日香重复着，尽管她坐在桌子上，拿起勺子开始吃那些浸泡在酸橙酱中的熟蛋白条和浓缩炖菜。“真是浪费。”就像前一天的茶一样，她的神经开始将这种味道与过去的事件和经历联系起来，从而在某种意义上让她真正品尝到了这顿饭。

"Hmm," she stated, and ate the last portion of stew. "Kinda bland. He's not slipping, but he can certainly do better."  
“嗯，”她评价道，吃掉了最后一块炖菜，“有点淡。他没退步，但肯定能做得更好。”

It barely went noticed by her, but for the first time in about fourteen years, Asuka's stomach grumbled in hunger.  
这几乎没被她注意到，但大约十四年来，明日香第一次感到肚子饿得咕咕叫。

注：这些我早在五年前就他妈预料到了。1. 真嗣破碎到基本不吃东西。2. 强制喂食场景。3. 明日香不让真嗣死，以免他‘自我了断’，或者说‘你的惩罚必须更严厉’。都差不多。叫我死亡预言家，或者诺斯特拉布道者。太爽了。

### Chapter 5 So Much Trouble in the World  

Rough terrain and broken pieces of concrete made for a harsh ride in damaged Suzuki, knocking his head against the window every few minutes. Sleep had not come easy the night before, and when it had finally enveloped him the sun had already begun to rise and Kensuke was gently shaking his shoulder. He had prepared a small meal for them both in a haze, not truly understanding what the man said or where they were supposed to go. His wrist had stopped burning for the moment; the not so gentle swaying of the car kept him awake more effectively than the burn of the cut.  
崎岖的地形和破碎的混凝土块让受损的铃木车颠簸不已，每隔几分钟他的头就会撞到车窗上。前一晚睡眠并不容易降临，当它终于笼罩他时，太阳已经开始升起，健介轻轻摇着他的肩膀。他在朦胧中为他们俩准备了一顿小餐，并不真正理解那人说的话或他们应该去哪里。此刻，他的手腕已经不再灼烧；车子不那么温柔的摇晃比割伤的灼痛更能让他保持清醒。

That small bento had been the first he had prepared in far too long.  
那个略微弯曲的便当盒是他许久以来第一次准备的。

"…-nd I started going on trips outside the safe zone to scavenge for parts. It's hard to find the right one most of the time, but when you find something that fits... man! It's the best feeling in the world."  
“…然后我开始到安全区外去搜寻零件。大多数时候很难找到合适的，但当你找到一个能用的…哇！那种感觉真是无与伦比。”

Shinji nodded, just the faint idea that Kensuke left the village regularly stuck in his brain. Had he used too much lime juice while trying to give the rations some flavor? Would the stew be too cold or unsavory after resting a few hours on the table? Would she eat it at all, or throw the food away?  
真嗣点点头，脑海中只留下了一个模糊的印象：健介经常离开村子。他在给口粮调味时是不是用了太多青柠汁？炖菜在桌上放了几个小时后会不会太凉或味道不佳？她会吃吗，还是会把食物扔掉？

_Unlikely,_ he reasoned. His head bounced against the window again. Everything to his left was tainted crimson; the firmament stopped being blue a few kilometers away from the broken down street. Hands, feet, strange humanoid shapes occupied the horizon; it was too hard to look at, so he focused on the trees, on the recollection of the strange forest, the ruins, and on Asuka's words. Memories returned in droplets as the fever faded completely; he recalled an elder gentleman trying to reprimand him for not eating before Hikari intervened. Or had it been Toji?  
不太可能，他推理着。他的头再次撞到了窗户上。他左侧的一切都被染成了深红色；天空在离这条废弃街道几公里外的地方就不再是蓝色了。地平线上满是手、脚和奇怪的人形；这太难直视了，于是他专注于树木，回忆那片奇异的森林、废墟，以及明日香的话。随着高烧完全消退，记忆如水滴般回流；他想起了有位年长的绅士试图因他没吃饭而训斥他，后来光介入了。还是说是剑介？

_Asuka won't waste food. She always says she's not hungry lately, though. I suppose she can just give it away_. His unease grew ever so lightly; it was still difficult to process the broken world he had created, where just a few miles away from him nothing but red loomed.  
明日香从不浪费食物。不过她最近总说自己不饿。我想她大概可以把它送人吧。他的不安愈发轻微地增长；他仍难以接受自己创造的这个支离破碎的世界，就在离他几英里远的地方，只有一片红色笼罩。

"-so Shikinami doesn't really go to the village."  
"-所以式波其实不常去村子。"

His headperked up, making Kensuke smirk. "Asuka? Why doesn't she-" He cut himself off before the question could flee his mouth. "Uhm, never mind."  
他猛地抬起头，让健介露出了微笑。“明日香？她为什么不去——”他话到嘴边又咽了回去。“呃，没什么。”

Another bump on the road, another tap of Shinji's head against the window. Kensuke cleared his throat, gave Shinji a sidelong glance, and redirected his eyes to the street. "She doesn't go to the village for lots of reasons. I don't think it's my place to say, though. You should ask her instead."  
路途再遇颠簸，真嗣的头又一次撞在车窗上。剑介清了清嗓子，斜眼瞥了真嗣一眼，又将目光转回街道。“她不去村子有很多原因。我觉得这不是我该说的，你还是直接问她吧。”

"Asuka hates me," Shinji whispered in response. "She doesn't want to talk to me."  
“明日香讨厌我，”真嗣低声回应，“她不想跟我说话。”

"Funny you should say that." A package containing six food bars was placed on Shinji's lap. "Since she was the one who put these in the car, with instructions that you were to eat all of them over the course of the day."  
“说来也巧。”一包装有六根能量棒的包裹被放在真嗣的腿上。“是她把这些放进车里的，还特意嘱咐你今天要全部吃完。”

The white and red wrapper reminded him of Asuka's jacket, and of the way she had placed it on him as they boarded the VTOL. It now lay folded up atop the blankets, along with the dictionary and the SDAT. _She's just making sure I don't starve myself. I haven't earned the right to even do that, apparently._ The glaring redness all around the landscape served as a grim reminder of how far away the goal of redemption truly was. _Obviously._  
那白红相间的包装纸让他想起了明日香的外套，以及他们登上垂直起降飞机时她如何将它披在他身上。如今，它被折叠好放在毯子上，旁边还有那本字典和 SDAT 播放器。她只是确保我不会饿着自己。显然，我连这样做的权利都还没挣到。四周刺眼的红色景象无时无刻不在提醒他，通往救赎的目标究竟有多么遥远。显然如此。

"She told me I'm not allowed to die yet, so I have to take care of myself. I have to eat." Shinji raised the bandaged hand. "I have to survive, even if I don't want to."  
“她告诉我我还不能死，所以我得照顾好自己。我得吃东西。”真嗣举起缠着绷带的手。“我得活下去，即使我不想。”

"Why did you ask to come with me, then?" The inquiry was poignant and direct, yet Kensuke's voice remained amiable, smile ever present on his lips.  
“那你为什么要跟我一起来呢？”这个问题尖锐而直接，但 Kensuke 的声音依旧友好，嘴角始终挂着微笑。

The devastated remnants of whatever city lay before them became clearer. "I don't really know. I guess I want to help, somehow."  
眼前这座城市的废墟残骸愈发清晰。“我真的不知道。我想，我希望能以某种方式提供帮助。”

The car took a slight detour in the direction of the black and red pillars rooted in the ground where the blue of the sky faded, and the wreckage began. "I may not be an expert," said Kensuke, "but wanting to help is not the same as wanting to die, or being forced to live. Heh, you even got Shikinami helping you out, in her own way."  
汽车朝着矗立在地面上、天蓝色逐渐褪去、废墟开始显现的黑红柱子方向稍作绕道。“我可能不是专家，”健介说道，“但想要帮忙并不等于想死，或是被迫活着。呵，你甚至得到了式波的帮助，以她自己的方式。”

_Asuka helped me?_ The small bag of protein bars felt unnaturally heavy on Shinji's lap all of the sudden. _I thought she wanted me to drop dead._ "Toji said to me yesterday… that people don't hate me here." The street disappeared, the surface becoming rougher as they left the pavement and threaded over a dirt road. The sky and horrible visage of the outside world became more apparent and impossible to escape from. "I don't understand why they don't."  
明日香帮我？那袋蛋白棒突然变得异常沉重，压在真嗣的腿上。我以为她巴不得我死掉。“昨天，阿薰对我说……这里的人并不讨厌我。”街道消失了，路面变得粗糙，他们离开了柏油路，驶上了一条土路。天空和外面世界的可怕景象变得更加明显，无法逃避。“我不明白他们为什么不讨厌我。”

"Not everything brought about by Third Impact was a disaster, Shinji," replied Kensuke with a more somber voice as they neared the strange, massive pillar. "You met Toji's child, didn't you? And their family. You saw everybody out there working, smiling, doing what they can, and living. That's what matters. And this..." The car stopped a mere few meters away from what looked like a barrier. "This is one of the places where I try to do some work."  
“并非第三次冲击带来的都是灾难，真嗣，”他们接近那根奇异而巨大的柱子时，健介用更为沉重的声音回答，“你见到了阿薰的孩子，不是吗？还有他们的家人。你看到外面的人们都在工作、微笑、尽其所能地生活。这才是重要的。而这里……”车子在看似屏障的地方仅几米处停下，“这里是我尝试做些工作的地方之一。”

The structure was not unlike an Entry Plug, only Shinji could see there were sections in constant motion. A strange energy vibrated and fed whatever barrier kept the waste from advancing into the green grass. Once out of the vehicle, Kensuke pressed a heavy red suit into his chest.  
这结构与插入栓颇为相似，只是真嗣能看到有些部分在不断移动。一种奇异的能量振动着，维持着阻挡废弃物侵入绿草地的屏障。一下车，剑介就将一件沉重的红色防护服塞进他怀里。

"You'll need this to get to through the work station. It's better for us to stay away from the core-ization waves coming outside the L-barrier. See those?" Kensuke pointed at the massive structure emitting energy. "Those are the sealing pillars. Ever since near Third Impact, that energy spread all over the globe and consumed all in its path. Kredit was kind enough to give us these. They keep the village safe."  
“你需要这个才能通过工作站。我们最好远离 L 屏障外泄的核心化波。看到那些了吗？”剑介指向那座散发能量的巨大结构，“那些是封印柱。自从接近第三次冲击以来，那种能量遍布全球，吞噬了所经之物。克雷迪特好心给了我们这些，它们保护着村庄的安全。”

Guilt stabbed away with every word Kensuke uttered; they felt like blows to Shinji's guts, or strikes worse than the elbow Asuka had hurled at his temple. _Start helping people. However you can, in whichever small way you can. Stop the inaction, Shinji._ He repeated the small mantra while donning the suit, head bowed and eyes stuck to the mud underneath his boots. _Doing nothing is just you being selfish. Own up to what you've done._  
剑介每说一句话，真嗣就感到一阵内疚刺痛；这些话如同重击他的腹部，甚至比明日香朝他太阳穴挥来的肘击还要狠。开始帮助人们吧。无论以何种微小的方式。停止无所作为，真嗣。他一边穿上防护服，一边低着头，目光紧盯着靴下的泥土，反复念叨着这小小的咒语。什么都不做只是你自私的表现。承担起你所做的一切。

"Doubt," recited Shinji to himself as quietly as possible. "A feeling of uncertainty or lack of conviction." The helmet was sealed to the suit with some difficulty; he was still weak and malnourished. "Feeling unsure about something." His eyes drifted to the bizarre hands and legs, gigantic and grotesque, that stood out in the distance. "Fear." Something akin to a headless Eva came into view, far from the barrier. "To be afraid."  
"怀疑，" 真嗣尽可能轻声地自言自语。"一种不确定或不确信的感觉。" 头盔费力地与装甲密封在一起；他仍然虚弱且营养不良。"对某事感到不确定。" 他的目光飘向远处那双巨大而怪异的手和腿。"恐惧。" 一个类似无头使徒的身影出现在远离屏障的地方。"感到害怕。"

Kensuke motioned for them to move. Shinji walked as quickly as the suit allowed; every now and then the rough material pressed against the bandages and made the scab itch. With the helmet firmly in place, the sound of his voice was even more muffled.  
健介示意他们移动。真嗣尽可能快地走着，装甲每动一下，粗糙的材料就会压到绷带上，让结痂发痒。头盔牢牢固定后，他的声音变得更加沉闷。

"Choice," he muttered next while licking dry, parched lips. "The act of selecting or making a decision when faced with… two or more possibilities." _Pilot the Eva, don't pilot the Eva. Fight, or don't fight. Live, or simply don't die._ "Adjective, worthy of being chosen." _Help, or don't. Help, in whichever way you can. Choose._  
"选择，" 他舔着干裂的嘴唇喃喃道。"面对两个或多个可能性时进行挑选或做出决定的行为。" 驾驶 EVA，不驾驶 EVA。战斗，或不战斗。活着，或仅仅是不要死去。"形容词，值得被选中的。" 帮助，或不帮助。以你能做到的任何方式帮助。选择。

Shinji's legs pushed him forward; mud stuck to the boots, and even through the mask the faint scent of either blood or LCL filtered through. "Start helping people," he urged himself quietly. "In whichever way you can."  
真嗣的双腿推动着他前行；泥浆粘附在靴子上，即便隔着面罩，血腥味或 LCL 的微弱气息仍渗透进来。“开始帮助人们，”他轻声自勉，“用你能做到的任何方式。”

After a few minutes of difficult maneuvering the pair reached a dug up hole of sorts. Kensuke droned on about how the pillars protected them from whatever he had started fourteen years before, and how the work being done was important to help them grow whatever they could in the fields. Constant work was being done to better the survival of the inhabitants. Toji, Hikari, their child and family, the nice man who greeted him the day before, the stranger offering lemonade; they all did their share.  
经过几分钟的艰难操作，两人到达了一个类似挖掘出的洞穴。 Kensuke 喋喋不休地讲述着这些柱子如何保护他们免受十四年前他开始的那场灾难的影响，以及正在进行的工作如何重要，以帮助他们在田地里尽可能多地种植作物。为了改善居民的生存条件，持续的工作正在进行。Toji、Hikari、他们的孩子和家人，前一天迎接他的那位友善的男子，提供柠檬水的陌生人；他们都尽了自己的一份力。

No heated glares welcomed him into the work station where a boy no older than himself perked up instantly upon seeing his old schoolmate. Once he reached them, the boy removed his helmet and offered a hand; he noticed similarities he could not quite place until the name tag on his chest registered.  
没有热烈的目光迎接他进入工作站，那里一个与他年龄相仿的男孩一看到他的老同学就立刻精神起来。当他走到他们面前时，男孩摘下头盔，伸出手；他注意到一些无法确切描述的相似之处，直到他胸前的名牌引起了注意。

'R. Kaji.' 'R. 加治'

_Kaji. 加治。_

"Mr. Kensuke! Good to see you!" There was a quiet sense of confidence in the boy's eyes that took Shinji by surprise. "It's been a while! How did your last trip go?"  
"健介先生！很高兴见到你！" 男孩眼中流露出的沉稳自信让真嗣有些意外。"好久不见了！你上次的旅行怎么样？"

"Heh, found some interesting things her and there. Shinji," Kensuke placed a hand on his shoulder and nudged him forward, "this is Ryoji. He'll be showing you around today. You said you wanted to help a bit, right?" Shinji nodded, gaze shifting to the pillar. "We always need extra hands getting samples around the core-ized areas. It's hard work, but it pays off. I have to go see to some repairs, I'll be back in a few hours. Kaji, I'm entrusting you with him. Don't overwork him, he just recovered from a fever."  
"嘿，这里那里发现了一些有趣的东西。真嗣，" 健介把手搭在他的肩上，轻轻推着他向前走，"这位是亮司。他今天会带你四处看看。你说过想帮忙的，对吧？" 真嗣点头，目光转向柱子。"我们总是需要额外的人手在核心化区域采集样本。虽然辛苦，但回报丰厚。我得去处理一些维修工作，几个小时后回来。加治，我把真嗣交给你了。别让他太累，他刚从发烧中恢复过来。"

"Copy that, Mr. Kensuke!" Ryoji acknowledged, offering a worn, bandaged hand in Shinji's direction. "Nice to meet you. Here, let me show you around."  
"“收到，Ken Sakura 先生！”Ryoji 回应道，伸出一只缠着绷带的旧手向 Shinji 示意。“很高兴见到你。来，我带你四处看看。”

Lilac hair, penetrating eyes, something along the jawline as well; every few seconds Shinji found more parallels. He shook the offered hand and was led to one of the more secluded parts of the research area. As he walked Shinji recalled the glares of the crew members on the Wunder with more clarity; the unfriendly atmosphere had been present from the start. Standing by the barrier that kept his sins from consuming the village, there was still no anger, no hatred in the eyes of those who nodded in his direction and kept on with their task.  
紫色的头发，锐利的眼神，还有下颌线的某些特征；每隔几秒，Shinji 就发现更多的相似之处。他握了握伸过来的手，被带到研究区域中较为隐蔽的一处。行走间，Shinji 更清晰地回忆起 Wunder 号上船员们的瞪视；从一开始，那种不友好的氛围就存在了。站在隔离他罪孽侵蚀村庄的屏障旁，那些向他点头示意并继续工作的人眼中，依然没有愤怒，没有仇恨。

"This is where we gather earth samples for Viko to analyze. Sometimes we need to dig deep into the soil to find undamaged roots," said Ryoji. Shinji was handed a shovel and instructed to dig underneath a patch of grass. The ground was dry, coarse and difficult to extract; every movement rubbed the wound on his hand and made it itch. "He and his team isolate the healthy sprouts and help them reproduce! That's how we have so many crops nowadays."  
"这里是我们采集土壤样本供 Viko 分析的地方。有时候，我们需要深入挖掘土壤，以找到未受损的根系。" 凌司说道。真嗣被递了一把铲子，并被告知要在一片草丛下挖掘。地面干燥、粗糙，难以挖掘；每一次动作都摩擦着他手上的伤口，令其发痒。"他和他的团队分离出健康的幼苗，帮助它们繁殖！这就是我们现在有这么多作物的原因。"

Somewhere in his recent memory the word 'Viko' rang a bell, but Shinji paid no mind to it as he forced the shovel deeper into the half-eroded dirt. Ryoji gave him a satisfied nod and carried on with his own task; they were to dig down until some actual dark earth appeared. The ground looked like salt underneath the crimson surface; it did not give in like regular dirt but broke instead, cracking and falling away in smaller chunks.  
在他最近的记忆中，“Viko”这个词似乎有些耳熟，但真嗣并未在意，只是用力将铲子更深地插入那半风化的泥土中。凉二满意地点了点头，继续自己的挖掘工作；他们的任务是挖到真正的黑土层出现。地表之下看似盐层，不同于普通泥土的松软，它坚硬且易碎，裂成小块崩落。

_And I'm supposed to find actual soil under this?_ Sweat rolled off Shinji's forehead and into the helmet's visor, stinging his eyes and hand. He kept digging regardless of how foolish it felt. A few meters from where he was working a pair shouted in joy as they extracted dark, almost black earth from one of their stations. _They're so happy about a little bit of dirt,_ he mused; anger sizzling and burning his lungs alongside the exhaustion.  
而我应该在这下面找到真正的土壤？汗水从真嗣的额头滚落，滴入头盔的护目镜中，刺痛了他的眼睛和手。尽管感觉多么愚蠢，他依然继续挖掘。在他工作地点几米外，一对人欢呼着从他们的站点中挖出了深色、近乎黑色的泥土。他们为一点点泥土如此高兴，他暗自思忖；愤怒与疲惫一同在肺中沸腾。

_This world I broke is one where even dirt or fresh seeds are a commodity. And here I am, not trying hard enough._ The shovel dug deep into the unforgiving ground as Shinji's heartbeat thundered in his ears. More cheers came from his left; a boy a bit older than him discovered what looked like old potatoes from a distance. _Asuka was right to want to punch me. This is nothing, I'm not helping, and I'm not making any difference. I can dig a thousand little holes and never get my permiss-_  
我破坏的这个世界，连泥土或新鲜种子都是稀缺品。而我在这里，还不够努力。铁锹深深插入无情的大地，真嗣的心跳在耳边轰鸣。更多的欢呼声从他的左侧传来；一个比他稍大的男孩从远处发现了看起来像旧土豆的东西。明日香想揍我是对的。这毫无意义，我没有帮忙，也没有任何改变。我可以挖上千个小洞，却永远得不到我的许可——

"Feels silly sometimes, right? Oh, you can take off the helmet now," Ryoji did so first and took a lungful of air. "Ah! That's the stuff! Mr. Kensuke fixed the ventilation problem." Not missing a beat, he continued to search for any sign of life in the myriad of red death meters away from them. "Maybe it doesn't feel like much, but every new sprout, every fistful of salvageable dirt, it all helps keep expanding our crops. I also heard there's a seed recollection program in the Wunder, and that Viko sends every viable seed he's able to salvage."  
"有时候感觉挺傻的，对吧？哦，你现在可以摘下头盔了，" 绫人先摘下头盔，深吸了一口气。"啊！就是这个感觉！健介先生修好了通风问题。" 他一刻不停地继续搜索着远处无数红色死亡指标中是否有生命迹象。"可能感觉不太明显，但每一株新芽，每一把可回收的泥土，都有助于我们扩大农作物种植。我还听说 Wunder 号上有个种子回收计划，维科会把所有他能回收的可行种子都送过去。"

A friendly pat on Shinji's shoulder; an act of encouragement, the same gesture Kensuke and Toji had provided. Despite the boy's suggestion, he kept the visor on and continued to drench it with perspiration. There was no place for comfort during his atonement. Whatever penance Asuka wanted him to live through was sure to begin there, at the border that kept the villagers alive and safe from his stupidity. _All I did was try to save someone, try to help someone. I tried to do something and I never saw her again._  
友善地拍了拍真嗣的肩膀；这是一种鼓励，和健介与渡志曾经给予的动作一样。尽管男孩提出了建议，他还是保持面罩戴着，继续让它被汗水浸透。在他赎罪的过程中，没有舒适可言。无论明日香希望他经历怎样的惩罚，肯定是从那里开始的，那个保护村民免受他愚蠢之害的边界。我所做的只是试图救人，试图帮助人。我试图做些什么，却再也没见到她。

"It's hard to work around here sometimes." Ryoji's next words fell on deaf ears. A bit of dark earth, a bit of hope, a sign that his miserable existence had a meaning besides hurting people; any respite was welcome. Shinji kept on digging in an almost frantic manner, and caught a glimpse of the grainy ground beginning to darken.  
"有时候在这里工作真不容易。" 龙司接下来的话无人理会。一点黝黑的泥土，一点希望，一个迹象表明他那悲惨的生活除了伤害人之外还有意义；任何喘息的机会都值得欢迎。真嗣近乎疯狂地继续挖掘，瞥见那颗粒状的地面开始变暗。

They worked for close to two hours without saying much, each going about their task in their own section. It was grueling, and soon the wound on Shinji's wrist began to flare as it moistened with sweat.  
他们默默工作了近两个小时，各自在自己的区域忙碌。这工作十分艰苦，很快，真嗣手腕上的伤口因汗水而湿润，开始刺痛起来。

"The air is heavy, and we have to wear this gear most days, but it really pays off," Ryoji said after offering Shinji some water; he took off the helmet just enough to drink. "We might just have peaches this year! Then we can send them to the other villages and they can have their own peach season!" Shinji spared a single thought for the boy; he was a complete antithesis to him.  
“空气很沉闷，我们大多数日子都得穿这身装备，但真的很值得，”凉二递给真嗣一些水后说道；他摘下头盔，只够喝水的程度。“今年我们可能会有桃子收成！然后我们可以把它们送到其他村庄，让他们也能有自己的桃子季节！”真嗣对这男孩稍作思考；他完全与他相反。

Joy, a queer air of confidence, a sunny and honest smile completely unlike his own stiff, uncomfortable expression. "This place used to be some sort of park once," Ryoji continued, pointing at Shinji's work. 'We've found lots of new seeds in this area, plus we've learned lots on how to grow food as close to the barrier as possible! No stone left unturned! So even if it feels a little dumb, this work is very important."  
喜悦，一种自信的异样气息，一个阳光而真诚的笑容，完全不同于他自己的僵硬和不自在。“这里曾经是个公园。”龙二继续说道，指着真嗣的工作。“我们在这片区域发现了很多新种子，还学到了很多如何在屏障附近尽可能种植食物的知识！不遗余力！所以即使感觉有点傻，这项工作非常重要。”

_We're just digging holes. It's a fitting activity for a prisoner like me, I guess, but not for others that are just trying to get by. This is part of the penance, this is what I did,_ Shinji mused whilst removing a rock from the ground. When he next dug the shovel in the ground, the soil gave under easily and a dark brown colored the pale dirt all around his boots. His heart raced as a foolish smile plastered itself on his lips. He was about to stab at it again when the boy's voice stopped him in his tracks.  
我们只是在挖洞。对于我这样的囚犯来说，这或许是个合适的活动，但对其他人来说，只是想勉强过日子。这是赎罪的一部分，这是我所做的，真嗣一边从地上移开一块石头一边沉思。当他再次将铲子插入地面时，土壤轻易地让开了，深棕色染遍了他靴子周围的浅土。他的心跳加速，愚蠢的笑容不由自主地贴在了他的唇边。他正要再次刺向它时，男孩的声音让他停下了脚步。

"Hold up, wait! Wait!" Ryoji's raised hand stopped him before the tip of the shovel impacted a small, round sphere covered in salty dirt. "Look at this beauty! And we were just talking about this!" A playful smack to his shoulder almost sent Shinji to the ground; he had not realized how exhausted he had begun to feel after two hours. "Hey, guys! We got one! I think it might be a peach!"  
“等等，等等！”莲二的举手在他铲子尖端即将碰到一个被盐土覆盖的小圆球之前阻止了他。“看看这个宝贝！我们刚刚还在谈论这个！”一记玩笑般的拍肩差点让真嗣摔倒；他没意识到自己已经开始感到多么疲惫，已经过去了两个小时。“嘿，伙计们！我们找到了一个！我觉得可能是个桃子！”

Shinji saw a blonde mop of hair perk up in the distance and take off running in their direction right after the word 'peach' rang out. He suppressed a groan when the now recognizable features of the stranger became visible. He chatted amiably with Ryoji, took the offered seed from him and beamed as though the entirety of Third Impact had ben regressed with naught but his pathetic finding. The stranger held up the seed to the light and smirked widely at both teens after inspecting it thoroughly.  
真嗣看到远处一团金色的头发突然竖起，随即朝着他们的方向飞奔而来，就在'桃子'这个词响起之后。当陌生人如今可辨认的特征变得清晰时，他强忍住了一声叹息。他与亮司亲切地交谈，接过他递来的种子，笑容满面，仿佛整个第三次冲击都被他那可怜的发现所逆转。陌生人将种子举到光线下，仔细检查后，对两位少年得意地笑了。

"_Prunus persica_, perfect condition!" Viko exclaimed. A kinship of sorts was evident between him and Ryoji, judging by how Ryoji beamed at the man's words. "And who knows, we might have gotten lucky and gotten an actual Shimizu Hakuto, the sweetest in the world. Heh, great work there, kiddo. Think I might just keep this one for myself."  
"桃属李，完美状态！"维科兴奋地喊道。他和亮司之间似乎有一种默契，从亮司听到他的话后露出的笑容就可以看出。"而且，谁知道呢，我们可能真的走运了，找到了真正的清水白桃，世界上最美味的。嘿，干得不错，小子。我想我可能会自己留下这个。"

"I didn't do a thing! Haven't even found any good soil this morning." Ryoji scratched away at his cheek and pointed at him. "Shinji's the one who did all the work!"  
"我什么都没做！今天早上连好土都没找到。"亮司挠了挠脸颊，指着他。"真嗣才是做了所有工作的人！"

Viko offered Shinji a smug grin after locking eyes with him. "Did he, now? Well, let no good deed go unpunished, as my brother would say. Here!" It was only due to his reflexes slowly returning that Shinji was able to catch the bottle thrown his way. "Have some lemonade, it's good for you. You too, Ryoji. Take a break for now; I'm sure the Commander doesn't want our guest passing out from dehydration or exhaustion so early in the morning, and he's probably got other things to do. I gotta run some tests on this. Great job, you too!"  
Viko 在与真嗣对视后露出了得意的笑容。“他现在知道了？正如我哥哥所说，不要让任何善行得不到回报。给！”正是由于他的反应逐渐恢复，真嗣才能接住向他扔来的瓶子。“喝点柠檬水，对你有好处。你也一样，Ryoji。现在休息一下；我相信指挥官不希望我们的客人一大早就因为脱水或疲劳而昏倒，而且他可能还有其他事情要做。我得对这个进行一些测试。干得好，你也是！”

Speeding off in the direction of the largest tent located near the pillar, Viko disappeared. "I still have… your bag..." Shinji said to the empty air, making Ryoji laugh as he lifted the cold beverage. "And your bottle."  
Viko 朝着靠近柱子的大帐篷方向疾驰而去，消失不见。“我还有…你的包…”真嗣对着空无一人的空气说道，让 Ryoji 笑着举起了冰凉的饮料。“还有你的瓶子。”

"Viko doesn't care about those bags, much less the bottles. Just don't throw them away," the boy explained with a shrug. They sat down next to the largest hole and drank with gusto, Ryoji pressing the cold bottle against his forehead and groaning in contentment. The air was chilly everywhere else, but being so close to the pillar's energy felt like being in a humid micro climate. "He'll find another one, or sew a new bag if he runs out. He forgets who he gave them to most of the time."  
"维科不在乎那些袋子，更别提瓶子了。只要别扔掉就行。"男孩耸耸肩解释道。他们在大坑旁坐下，畅饮起来，凌二将冰凉的瓶子贴在额头上，满足地呻吟。四周空气都透着寒意，但靠近支柱的能量却仿佛置身于一个湿润的小气候中。"他会再找一个，或者缝个新袋子，如果用完了的话。他大多数时候都记不清给了谁。"

The sun began to rise above the mountains behind them and shone upon the wasteland where those haunting figures stood. "You two seem to get along well," Shinji mentioned without really meaning to. "Have you known each other for a while?"  
太阳开始在他们的背后山脉上升起，照耀着那些令人难忘的身影所站立的荒原。“你们俩看起来相处得不错，”真嗣不经意间提了一句。“你们认识很久了吗？”

"Pretty much my whole life, yeah," said Ryoji before finishing his bottle and staring at it with fondness. "I've never met my parents. They told me my mother left me in the village after I was born, and that my father's a great hero. I don't know if it's true or not, all I know is Mr. Kensuke and Viko have been helping everybody out ever since I can remember." He turned to Shinji with a somewhat somber expression. "Do you know your parents well?"  
“差不多我整个生命，是的，”凌二说完喝完瓶子里的酒，带着一丝眷恋地看着它。“我从未见过我的父母。他们告诉我，我母亲生下我后就把我留在了村子里，而我父亲是个伟大的英雄。我不知道这是真是假，我只知道自从我有记忆以来，健介先生和维科一直在帮助大家。”他转向真嗣，表情略显沉重。“你和你的父母很亲近吗？”

_Why would you ask me something like that?_ The very thought of his father scared and angered Shinji; he was at a complete loss for how to even consider the man's existence anymore. The picture Fuyutsuki had shown him flashed through his mind. _I don't know anything about him, in the end. He's as much a stranger to me as I am to him._  
“你为什么要问我这样的问题？”一想到他的父亲，真嗣就感到恐惧和愤怒；他完全不知道该如何再去考虑那个男人的存在。冬月给他看的那张照片在脑海中闪过。“最终，我对他一无所知。他对我来说就像我对他的陌生一样。”

"Until very recently I didn't even remember my mother's face," Shinji admitted, eyes downcast and fixed on his own bottle. "She died when I was very young, and… I don't really get along with my father. I don't understand him."  
“直到最近，我甚至记不清母亲的脸了，”真嗣承认道，目光低垂，盯着他自己的瓶子。“她在我很小的时候就去世了，而且……我和父亲的关系也不太好。我不理解他。”

"Hmm." Ryoji laid down flat on the ground, hands behind his back. "Yeah, I don't really get why my mother just left me here. Viko keeps pestering me about that." He stretched a hand to the skies, lost in thought. "He tells me I'm not trying hard enough, and that she probably has her reasons that… that to her, at least, make sense. I guess since he's always been around I never really felt lonely, but I get what he's saying. I haven't really tried to understand her."  
“嗯。”凉二平躺在地上，双手枕在脑后。“是啊，我不太明白为什么我妈妈就把我留在这里了。维克总是缠着我问这个。”他伸出手向天空，陷入沉思。“他告诉我，我没有努力去理解，而她可能有自己的理由……至少对她来说，这些理由是有意义的。我想，因为他一直在我身边，我从未真正感到孤独，但我明白他的意思。我确实没有真正尝试去理解她。”

A pang of fresh guilt stabbed at Shinji's chest. As if tearing the world apart and most likely being the reason why Ryoji had no clue who his parents truly were wasn't enough, he was also flaunting how he had indeed had a chance to interact with the one parent left to him, a luxury Ryoji probably only dreamed of.  
一股新鲜的愧疚感刺痛了真嗣的胸口。仿佛撕裂世界，很可能也是让凉二不知道自己父母真实身份的罪魁祸首还不够，他还在炫耀自己确实有机会与剩下的那位家长互动，这是凉二可能只能在梦中奢望的奢侈。

"I guess I haven't really tried to understand my father, either," Shinji concluded out loud and glanced at the darkened horizon. Instead of being envious of Ryoji's declaration of not having suffered the crushing lonesomeness he was familiar with, Shinji felt relieved. "It's never crossed my mind that it's actually possible."  
"我想我也没有真正试图去理解我的父亲。" 真嗣大声得出结论，目光掠过昏暗的地平线。他没有对凉宫宣称自己未曾遭受过他所熟悉的沉重孤独感到嫉妒，反而感到一阵释然。"我从没想过这其实是可能的。"

_I haven't even tried to understand Asuka, or Misato, or anyone in this village. I don't understand why they do what they do. If Misato really doesn't care and just wants me to go away, why hasn't she pulled the trigger on that choker already, or left me to rot in a cell? If Asuka hates me so much, why did she make sure I had eaten, or that this cut healed? Why did she give me her jacket?  
我甚至从未试图去理解明日香、美里，或是这个村子里的任何人。我不明白他们为何如此行事。如果美里真的不在乎，只希望我离开，为何她还未启动那项圈，或任由我在牢房中腐烂？如果明日香如此憎恨我，为何她会确保我有饭吃，或是这伤口愈合？为何她会给我她的夹克？_

Despite the sweat and the suit rubbing against it, the cut was not burning or itching too much, and the fever had receded almost entirely. "I should try a little harder," he mumbled just loud enough for Ryoji to hear. _If piloting only ever leads to me hurting people, then I'll do everything else._ "Should we get back to work?"  
尽管汗水和西装摩擦让伤口有些不适，但并未感到灼热或瘙痒，热度也几乎完全消退了。“我应该再努力一点，”他喃喃自语，声音刚好能让暸司听到。如果驾驶只会让我伤害别人，那我就做其他所有事。“我们应该回去工作吗？”

"Yeah, I guess we should both try a little harder. Let's keep it up!" Ryoji jumped back to his feet and offered Shinji a hand with the same vibrant, confident smile from earlier.  
“嗯，我想我们都应该再努力一点。加油吧！”暸司跳回脚上，伸出一只手给真嗣，脸上依然挂着之前那种充满活力和自信的笑容。

He recognized the expression; it had been on Mr. Kaji's face so long ago, back when the world still made some sense. They went back to digging -with Ryoji finding a seedling of his own after another hour- drank away the refreshing lemonade, and exchanged a few words regarding life in the village. At some point in the morning Shinji found himself smiling slightly; Asuka was nowhere in sight, after all, and he felt free to breathe in the moist air and even laugh at one of Ryoji's jokes.  
他认出了这个表情；很久以前，当世界还有些道理可讲时，加治先生脸上也出现过。他们继续挖掘——一小时后暸司也找到了自己的幼苗——喝着清爽的柠檬水，交流了一些关于村子里生活的点滴。早晨的某个时刻，真嗣发现自己微微露出了笑容；毕竟，明日香不在视线中，他感到自由地呼吸着湿润的空气，甚至对暸司的一个笑话笑出了声。

As he left the small work station, panting and drenched in sweat with a silly little smirk lighting his features and being greeted by the other workers, something caught his eye. Joy quickly morphed into terror. From afar, one of the seemingly petrified monstrosities turned, and began to walk.  
当他离开狭小的工作台，喘着粗气，浑身是汗，脸上挂着傻乎乎的微笑，被其他工人迎接时，有什么东西吸引了他的目光。喜悦迅速转变为恐惧。远处，一个看似僵化的怪物转过身，开始行走。

---

_Glad to see me. Glad to see me? Why? What's so freaking great about seeing me? It wasn't me you almost ended the world over, after all.  
见到我很高兴。见到我很高兴？为什么？见到我有什么了不起的？毕竟，差点毁灭世界的不是我。_

The last piece of protein bar rested on the bento, half-eaten. Some hours had already gone by since Kensuke had left with Shinji; nothing but the sound of birds and the wind filtered through the house. It kept happening that morning, flavors and memories attached to them returned. The bland taste of rations and generic food of her childhood, the spices and smells of stew which brought her back to school in Tokyo. She detested remembering hunger or the stupid school uniform, hated being reminded how she was no longer human, and even so the memories felt painfully sweet.  
最后一小块蛋白棒躺在便当盒里，只吃了一半。自从健介和真嗣离开后，已经过去好几个小时了；屋子里只有鸟鸣和风声。那天早上，味道和与之相关的记忆不断涌现。童年时期乏味的口粮和普通食物的味道，让她回想起东京的学校，炖菜的香料和气味。她讨厌回忆饥饿或那愚蠢的校服，讨厌被提醒自己已不再是人类，尽管如此，这些记忆却痛苦地甜蜜。

When had been the last time anybody who was not Kensuke had offered her a meal, and when had said meal actually tasted good at all? Being among the very few who knew of her condition, Aida did not much bother to prepare more than indispensable nourishment. _Not that whatever he cooks tastes any better than the rations. Not that I can even tell the difference, anymore. Not that it matters._  
上一次有人——不是健介——请她吃饭是什么时候，而那顿饭又何时真正尝起来美味过呢？作为极少数知晓她状况的人之一，相田并不怎么费心准备超过必需的营养。并非他做的任何东西都比配给品味道好。并非我还能分辨出其中的差别。并非这有什么关系。

Years upon years of drinking water as the only sustenance and growing increasingly estranged to all things human, and then a tiny box with a home-cooked meal and a pathetic assortment of words gentled down the loneliness for a few heartbeats. The pain never left, but waned just as the rage did lately, sizzling down and hiding away under the strenuous task of ensuring the Third Child was alive. _It's not horrible when he actually wants to eat. I don't intend to keep shoving protein bars down his throat every time he decides life is too much of a hassle to so much as eat._  
多年以水为生，与人渐行渐远，直到一个小小的盒子装着家常饭菜和一串可怜巴巴的文字，温柔地抚慰了那几下心跳的孤独。痛苦从未离去，但最近也像愤怒一样减弱了，嘶嘶作响后躲藏在确保三号孩子活着的艰巨任务下。当他真的想吃东西时，这并不糟糕。我不打算每次他觉得生活太麻烦连吃都不想吃时，就继续往他喉咙里塞蛋白棒。

Her weight shifted on the chair. The small slice of stew-covered protein bar kept glaring up from the box.  
她坐在椅子上的重心微微移动。那小块沾满炖菜的蛋白棒依旧在盒子里瞪着她。

On the rare occurrences where the confinement cage within the Wunder or the Entry Plug were not within reach and she was forced to partake in humane duties such as breathing or having time off, the gaping hole in her soul made itself known. Aside from sitting on the table or lying in bed with her Wonderswan, there was little she was interested in doing outside the old train station.  
在极少数情况下，当 Wunder 或插入栓内的禁闭笼无法触及，她被迫参与呼吸或休息等人性化活动时，她灵魂中的巨大空洞就会显现出来。除了坐在桌前或躺在床上玩 Wonderswan，她在旧火车站外几乎没有感兴趣的事情。

"Some time off this turned out to be," she muttered into the empty kitchen with a huff. "What a pleasant vacation, sitting here doing nothing and pretending I can actually taste this crap." Regardless of her own reasoning, the last remnant of the meal Shinji had left for her was consumed. "It's not like it's anything short of mediocre, anyway."  
"这所谓的休假还真是有够无聊的。" 她对着空荡荡的厨房嘟囔着，语气中带着一丝不满。"多么愉快的假期啊，坐在这里无所事事，还得装作能尝出这垃圾的味道。" 尽管心里这么想，她还是吃掉了真嗣留给她的最后一口饭菜。"反正也不至于难吃到哪里去。"

Akagi insisted there was nothing wrong with her sense of taste or smell. They functioned as normally as could be expected, yet her reluctance to eat had most likely atrophied something. Everything tasted of ash and felt synthetic; even the water was obtained from purifying urine, so it was far better to simply forget it altogether. With little else to do than to sit and play video games, however, not reminiscing turned impossible.  
赤城坚称她的味觉和嗅觉并无异常。它们运作如常，可她对进食的抗拒很可能已导致某种退化。一切食物尝起来都如灰烬般索然无味，感觉像是人工合成；就连饮用水也是通过净化尿液得来，因此干脆彻底忘却这一切反倒更好。然而，除了坐着玩电子游戏外别无他事，不去回忆变得不可能。

_I hate this stupid crap. Why the hell could I not just have stayed on the Wunder while they sent the brat here by himself?  
我讨厌这种愚蠢的废话。我他妈为什么就不能留在 Wunder 号上，让他们自己把那小鬼送过来呢？_

Her typical activities had borne no result; a walk into the wilderness had done nothing to settle her nerves, and finding the small path that led to the lime trees only worsened her headache. It had taken her a few minutes to return to the small stream. Presumably at some point in her life the scenery would have been considered beautiful and peaceful; lush trees swaying to the wind and forest creatures going about their business, the smell of moist soil and oranges.  
她平时的活动毫无成效；走进荒野并没有让她的神经平静下来，而找到通往酸橙树的小径反而加剧了她的头痛。她花了好几分钟才回到那条小溪边。想必在她生命中的某个时刻，这景色会被认为是美丽而宁静的；茂密的树木随风摇曳，森林生物忙于自己的事务，湿润土壤和橙子的香气。

All the small forest had done was remind her how the little brat had so effortlessly communicated with a complete stranger and yet failed to so much as look her as he spoke. Asuka scoffed at the table, eye drifting to her Wonderswan. _Yeah, you've been doing a great job at speaking in a calm and collected manner to a shell-shocked individual. Never mind that he's a brat, slobbering all over himself for four days, running away, not eating. Cooking._  
这片小森林所做的只是提醒她，那个小鬼是如何轻松地与一个完全陌生的人交流，却在他讲话时连看都不看她一眼。明日香在桌边嗤之以鼻，目光飘向她的 Wonderswan。是啊，你一直在用冷静沉着的方式和一个受到惊吓的人说话。别提他是个小鬼，四天来一直自暴自弃，逃跑，不吃东西。做饭。

Her gaze danced between the handheld and the kitchen. _Cooking's pretty much the one normal thing he's done ever since being recovered from Unit 01. Heh, and he goes and makes a goddamn bento the next morning. What an idiot. Well, now he's off to do more normal things with Kenken._  
她的目光在掌机和厨房之间游移。自从从 01 号机中被救出后，烹饪几乎是他唯一保持正常的事情。呵，第二天早上他还做了个该死的便当。真是个傻瓜。好吧，现在他要和健健去做更多正常的事情了。

Creaks in the wood and her own breathing were all that remained after noon settled and the temperature rose. She did eventually reach for the Wonderswan, and her thoughts hushed to an extent. Even in the quiet, and especially considering how days were trickling by and her doom approached, all she could do was think of the boy's words and recent actions. He had run away very briefly if at all, and could she really blame him after having shoved food into his mouth? How did the Third Child react to her aggression?  
午后，随着气温的升高，木头的吱嘎声和她的呼吸成了仅存的声音。她最终还是拿起了 Wonderswan，思绪也稍稍平息。即使在寂静中，尤其是考虑到日子一天天过去，她的末日临近，她所能做的只是回想那个男孩的话语和最近的举动。他是否真的短暂逃离过，而在她强行喂食之后，她又怎能真的责怪他呢？第三适格者对她的攻击有何反应？

Kindness. 善良。

Thinking on the word drew her eyes to the dictionary lying on the floor. The book had been lying around the many others Four-Eyes collected, by far one of the heavier ones containing both English and Japanese translations and definitions. Hearing their captive reduced to a catatonic mess that did not eat, sleep or react to anything had cut too close to home to some extent. She herself had fared no better after waking up and realizing the world had almost ended, her humanity was being corroded from the inside by a monstrous parasite, and that she was not aging.  
思索着这个词，她的目光落在了地板上的那本词典上。这本书混杂在四眼收集的众多书籍中，无疑是其中较重的一本，包含了英语和日语的翻译与定义。听到他们的俘虏变得如同木僵一般，不吃不睡，对任何事物都毫无反应，这在某种程度上触动了她的心弦。她自己醒来后发现世界几乎毁灭，人性正被一个怪异的寄生虫从内部侵蚀，而且她不再衰老，情况也好不到哪儿去。

Asuka had read through some of Mari's novels during the endless days and nights awaiting the next battle. The heavy book resting atop her jacket stood out even then; hearing the brat mutter to himself had been the excuse she needed to go through it. Marking down the words had been an unexpected, almost unconscious move.  
在等待下一场战斗的无尽日夜里，明日香翻阅了真希波的一些小说。那本压在她外套上的厚书即使在那时也格外显眼；听到那小子自言自语，她便找到了借口去翻阅它。标记下这些词句，几乎是一种无意识的举动。

_Screw it, let's see if the idiot has learned anything, or so much as bothered to_ _**try**_ _and learn something. It's not like there's anything better to do._ The scarf was gone from her neck since there was no traumatized Third Child around to trigger into vomiting, yet Asuka's hand still went up and brushed the metal that served as a permanent reminder of what she was. She picked the dictionary and plopped down on the boy's blankets, noticing how the little music player was tugged beside the red garment. A slight wave of curiosity crashed through and was suppressed with brutality; she picked up the book instead.  
管他的，看看这傻瓜有没有学到点什么，或者至少有没有费心去学点东西。反正也没什么更好的事可做。自从没有那个受创的第三适格者在旁边引发呕吐，她脖子上的围巾就不见了，然而明日香的手还是不由自主地抚上了那块金属，那是她身份的永久提醒。她拿起字典，一屁股坐在男孩的毯子上，注意到那个小音乐播放器被拽到了红色衣物旁边。一阵轻微的好奇心涌来，又被她无情地压制下去；她转而拿起了书。

_Let him have his stupid little music box. Four-eyes and her stupid love for pop culture is the only reason I know what song he was slurring. Huh, look at this. Brat woke up to some extent, it seems. He's so mentally feeble, making Toji and Kenken fuzz over him as he sits there and takes his sweet time to recover. Hmm, he's been underlining the definition he prefers, too.  
让他留着那愚蠢的小音乐盒吧。四眼和她对流行文化的愚蠢热爱是我知道他在哼什么歌的唯一原因。哼，看看这个。看来这小子多少醒了点。他心智如此脆弱，让东治和健健围着他转，而他却坐在那里悠哉地慢慢恢复。嗯，他还一直在他喜欢的定义下面划线。_

Pens and pencils were all around the old station; Kensuke loved to take notes of every little thing he considered important. She had not seen Shinji pick one up, however, nor had she actually witnessed him marking the pages or thoroughly going through the meaning of each word. On the second to last page, the track he kept listening to was slowly being deciphered and translated.  
旧车站周围散落着钢笔和铅笔；健介喜欢记录他认为重要的每一件小事。然而，她从未见过真嗣拿起一支笔，也没有亲眼目睹他标记页面或仔细琢磨每个词的含义。在倒数第二页上，他一直反复听的那首曲子正慢慢被解读和翻译。

The Major huffed at the small effort and went to the page where 'redemption' was, blinking in surprise as another word marked in deep blue jumped into view. "Repent," she whispered. "To feel or express sincere regret or remorse about one's wrongdoing. To view or think of an action or omission with deep regret or remorse."  
少校对这小小的努力嗤之以鼻，翻到标有'救赎'的那一页，惊讶地眨眼，因为另一个用深蓝色标记的词跃入眼帘。“忏悔，”她低声说，“对自己所犯的错误感到真诚的悔恨或懊悔。对某一行为或疏忽深感遗憾或懊悔。”

Another blue underlining drew her attention on the other page. "Recovery," Asuka read aloud while a small frown darkened her features. "Tch, a return to a normal state of health, mind, or strength. Yeah, right. Like that's even possible anymore, you idiot."  
另一页上蓝色的下划线吸引了她的注意。“康复，”明日香大声读出，眉头微微皱起。“恢复到正常的健康、心智或力量状态。切，说得倒好听。像那样的事，你这个白痴，怎么可能再有可能了。”

Several new pages had been marked in both the English and Japanese versions, with most of the English words being the ones she had marked, and those belonging to the song's lyrics. The Japanese equivalent was tinted in either black ink or pencil, and only new words had been marked with blue. No other notes were visible apart from the song being translated in the back.  
英文和日文版本中都标记了好几页新内容，其中大部分英文单词是她标记的，属于歌曲的歌词。日文对应部分用黑色墨水或铅笔着色，只有新词用蓝色标记。除了歌曲被翻译在背面外，没有其他注释可见。

Valor, struggle, strength, uncertainty, misunderstanding, silence and fear had all been underlined, with the definitions yet to be marked in any way. She scoffed at the boy's choices and yet felt them be an irremediable part of who he was. He appeared to be trying to analyze his own actions and learn the reason behind them, at long last.  
勇气、斗争、力量、不确定、误解、沉默和恐惧都被划了下划线，定义尚未以任何方式标记。她对男孩的选择嗤之以鼻，却又觉得这是他无法改变的一部分。他似乎终于在尝试分析自己的行为并找出背后的原因。

_Credit where credit is due, even if it's for this idiot,_ she mused with the shadow of a smirk. _Feeble as he is, the brat is trying to grow up._  
该给的功劳还是要给，哪怕是对这个傻瓜，她暗自思忖，嘴角掠过一丝笑意。尽管他如此虚弱，这小子正努力成长。

Before she closed the dictionary and went to retrieve the Wonderswan, a word she had failed to notice before jumped into view. Unlike any of the others, this one in particular was marked in red. The first emotion that jumped into her throat was a deep sense of envy, an all-consuming wrath and desire to rip out the page and burn it on the stove. Then she saw the small depiction of a pirate skull with an eyepatch drawn just beside the word, and her face heated with something besides rage.  
在她合上词典去取 Wonderswan 之前，一个之前未曾注意到的词突然跃入眼帘。与其他词不同，这个词特别用红色标记。涌上她喉咙的第一种情绪是深深的嫉妒，一种吞噬一切的愤怒和想要撕下那页并在炉子上烧掉的欲望。随后她看到了这个词旁边画着一个小小的海盗骷髅，戴着眼罩，她的脸因除了愤怒之外的其他情绪而发热。

The book was slammed shut, she forcefully placed it back on top of the jacket and swiftly went to lay on her bed. She played away as afternoon came and the birds started with their evening tunes, then took a shower and glanced at the choker, wondering what Shinji had seen to make him react so strongly to it. Regardless of what she did, the small, crudely drawn depiction of her roundel forced her to open the closet door and retrieve the pathetic little plushy Mari had vandalized.  
她猛地合上书，用力将其放回夹克上，迅速躺到床上。她玩着游戏，直到下午来临，鸟儿开始唱起傍晚的曲调，然后洗了个澡，瞥了一眼项圈，想知道真嗣看到了什么才会对它反应如此强烈。无论她做什么，那个小巧、粗糙绘制的她的圆盘图案都迫使她打开衣柜门，取出玛丽糟蹋过的那个可怜的小玩偶。

"Beauty," Asuka told the little doll. "An attractive quality or set of qualities that give pleasure to those who experience it or think about it."  
“美丽，”明日香对小玩偶说。“一种或一组能给体验者或思考者带来愉悦的吸引人的特质。”

The word most certainly had nothing to do with her; simply a foolish coincidence from the mind of a broken boy. After all, what quality did she have aside from being an Eva pilot that could be considered beautiful in any way?  
这个词当然与她无关；只是那个心灵破碎的男孩脑海中一个愚蠢的巧合。毕竟，除了作为 EVA 驾驶员之外，她还有什么特质能被认为在任何方面都是美丽的呢？

Soon after joining the larger group of workers around the pillar and being congratulated on his finding, Shinji was asked to follow the apparent village commander. They drove for a few minutes down the street, heading towards a part of the L-barrier that shone particularly crimson in the distance, still dressed in the heavy suits. Kensuke said very little on the way and only commented on the seed finding, with a vague mention that he'd elaborate on the other boy's past later on along with an inquiry towards Shinji's hands.  
加入围绕柱子的大群工人并受到祝贺后不久，真嗣被要求跟随显然是村子指挥官的人。他们沿着街道行驶了几分钟，朝着远处特别鲜红的 L 型屏障部分驶去，仍然穿着厚重的防护服。一路上，健介几乎没有说话，只是对种子发现一事含糊地提了几句，并模糊地提到稍后会详细讲述另一个男孩的过去，同时询问了真嗣的手的情况。

There were blisters on his palms and fingers, some of which a gentle elderly lady in the work station had been kind enough to cover with some Band-Aids. He was sporting new bandages on the wrist as well, courtesy of the stranger and Ryoji who had noticed how dirty the gauze had become during work. No headaches or nausea were hindering his body for the first time in days.  
他的手掌和手指上有水泡，工作站里一位慈祥的老妇人好心地用创可贴覆盖了它们。他的手腕上也缠上了新的绷带，这要感谢那位陌生人和良治，他们注意到工作时纱布变得有多脏。连续几天来，他的身体第一次没有受到头痛或恶心的困扰。

_I wonder if she ate the food. Kensuke said she doesn't eat much, though. I knew I should've looked for something other than the rations.  
我在想她是否吃了那些食物。健介说她吃得不多。早知道我就该找些别的，而不是这些干粮。_

Had the thought not entered Shinji's head, then the image of a naked Second Child would not have flashed by, coloring his skin scarlet. He looked away despite knowing the older man had not a clue why he suddenly jerked his head towards the window. In an effort to wipe away the memory and worse, the image of the damned choker on her neck, he refocused on the strange humanoid figure that neared with every passing second.  
如果不是真嗣脑海中闪过这个念头，那么一个裸体的二号适格者的形象就不会突然浮现，让他的皮肤染上绯红。尽管知道那个年长的人并不明白他为何突然转向窗户，他还是移开了视线。为了抹去这段记忆，更糟糕的是她脖子上那该死的项圈的影像，他重新将注意力集中在那个逐渐逼近的奇怪人形生物上。

Trepidation forced his heartbeat to quicken. Remembering her also meant recalling the mentions of her constant refusal of food.  
恐惧让他的心跳加速。想起她也意味着回忆起她一再拒绝食物的提及。

"Why," he started, licking his lips. "Why doesn't Asuka eat much, lately? Do you know? Is it because of the curse of Eva?" Fear added to the mess of twirling emotions; with a mind not completely shattered they were inescapable. Would the same happen to him with the passing of time? "I remember she used to eat just fine back in school, and in the apartment with…" pain and hollow heartache coursed through him, "…with Misato."  
"为什么，"他开口道，舔了舔嘴唇。"为什么最近 Asuka 吃得不多？你知道吗？是因为 Eva 的诅咒吗？"恐惧加剧了纷乱的情绪漩涡；在未完全崩溃的心灵中，这些情绪是逃不掉的。随着时间的流逝，同样的事情会发生在他的身上吗？"我记得她在学校时吃得很好，还有在公寓里和……"痛苦和空虚的心痛涌上心头，"……和美里。"

Kensuke winced at the question and worsened his already crumbling mood. "She doesn't go to the village for the same reason she doesn't eat much. That's all I can really say, and it's not like she told me. I was simply… _informed_ of some things. It's not my place to say." Shinji felt Kensuke's gaze shift to him and offer a sad glance. "Sorry about that."  
听到这个问题，真希波皱了皱眉，心情更加糟糕。"她不去村子也是因为她吃得不多。我能说的就这么多，她也没告诉我。我只是……被告知了一些事情。这不是我该说的。"真嗣感觉到真希波的目光转向他，投来一个悲伤的眼神。"抱歉。"

"That's okay." Shinji shrugged, faint rubbing at the bandages. "It was rude to ask something like that, I'm sorry."  
"没关系。"真嗣耸了耸肩，轻轻地揉了揉绷带。"问那样的问题很失礼，对不起。"

"No need to apologize. I wish I could be of more help, but some things you just have to find out for yourself. I'm sure she'd love to just talk to you at some point."  
"不必道歉。我希望能帮上更多忙，但有些事你只能自己去发现。我相信她会愿意在某一刻和你聊聊的。"

Shinji almost laughed at that statement. "Just talk, huh?" The possibility felt far-fetched with the amount of disgust Asuka radiated when addressing him. _Never too late to start trying._ "Guess it wouldn't hurt to try."  
听到这话，真嗣差点笑出声来。“只是聊聊，是吗？”考虑到明日香对他表现出的厌恶程度，这可能性似乎遥不可及。不过，尝试永远不会太晚。“试试也无妨。”

"That's the spirit! Now, this is just a brief little pause, okay? I need to check on something." The car stooped about a kilometer away from the barrier. "Damn, just as I thought. It's getting closer."  
"这就对了！现在，这只是个小停顿，好吗？我需要检查一下某件事。”车子在距离屏障约一公里处停下。“该死，正如我所料。它越来越近了。”

It had _not_ been his mind playing tricks, to Shinji's everlasting horror. Once his feet touched the ground and his gaze rose to the figure, the movement of the gigantic being was impossible to miss. It was walking, and it was not only the one. He saw more and more as his gaze scanned the horizon, many of them sluggishly treading through the wasteland.  
并非他的心智在作祟，令真嗣永生难忘的恐怖。当他的双脚触地，目光上移至那身影时，巨大存在的移动已无法忽视。它在行走，而且不止一个。随着他的视线扫过地平线，越来越多的它们映入眼帘，许多都在荒原上缓慢地跋涉。

A particularly grotesque apparition was pawing at the barrier, one which had been obscured by the mountain range before. He spared Kensuke a sidelong glance while his skin turned cold. The creature kept pressing against the barrier for a few more tense moments and slid off to the side, almost falling over; it tried and failed to rise back up. In that moment another of the figures rose from the waste; it manifested right out of the red waste and turned to try and enter the protected area, to no avail.  
一个异常丑陋的幽灵正扒在屏障上，这东西之前被山脉遮挡住了。他冷冷地瞥了 Kensuke 一眼，皮肤感到一阵寒意。那怪物又紧张地压在屏障上几秒钟，然后滑向一边，差点摔倒；它试图站起来却失败了。就在这时，另一个身影从荒地中升起；它直接从红色荒地中显现出来，转身试图进入保护区，但未能成功。

"We call them Wanderers," Kensuke muttered between gritted teeth as he filmed the creature. "Headless copies of Unit 01, moving around the core-ized areas and occupying any unblemished location they can find." He gestured towards the pillar. "The L-Barrier keeps all these villages protected, that's why I had to go fix the electrical feed as soon as possible. I've been monitoring these for a while. They seem to try and get in but lose interest after a while."  
“我们称它们为流浪者，”Kensuke 咬着牙低声说道，同时拍摄着那怪物。“无头的初号机复制体，在核心化区域游荡，占据任何未受污染的地方。”他指向柱子。“L 屏障保护着所有这些村庄，这就是为什么我必须尽快修复电力供应。我已经监视它们一段时间了。它们似乎试图进入，但过一会儿就会失去兴趣。”

"W-Wanderers?" The words reverberated in Shinji's brain. "What are th-what are they?"  
"旅...旅者？" 这个词在真嗣的脑海中回荡。"他们是什么...他们究竟是什么？"

"Our best guess is an accumulation of core-ized life forms trying to take shape. That's just a guess, though. In reality we have no actual clue."  
我们最好的猜测是，一些核心化的生命形态正在试图成形。不过，这仅仅是个猜测。实际上，我们毫无头绪。

Copies of Unit 01, seemingly semi-sentient beings that rose up out of nowhere and tried to corrupt any healthy piece of land they could find. All living energy in the world was necessary for his father's plan to succeed; this was but another cluster of his mindless soldiers to carry on the war to end all life and reunite the madman with his mother. These goliaths were formed of life.  
第 01 号单元的复制品，看似半意识的生物，不知从何处崛起，试图腐化任何健康的土地。世界上所有的生命能量都是他父亲计划成功的必要条件；这只是他无意识的士兵中的另一群，继续进行着终结所有生命的战争，让那个疯子与他母亲重聚。这些巨人是由生命构成的。

Life. 生命。

Kensuke continued to explain how the pillars kept the village safe from any and all direct effects of whatever had happened to the planet. What he had started fourteen years before had distortedly evolved into mindless beings hungering to devour the world, a constant threat to the survivors of his stupidity and inaction. Yet another abysmal problem impossible to reverse or remedy, one more nail in the coffin of his incompetence.  
健介继续解释这些柱子是如何保护村庄免受地球上发生的任何直接影响的。十四年前他开始的行动已经扭曲地演变成了渴望吞噬世界的无意识生物，对他的愚蠢和无所作为的幸存者构成了持续的威胁。又一个无法逆转或补救的可怕问题，是他无能的又一记棺材钉。

Shinji wanted nothing more than to look away and run, flee to the ruins and lay down on the floor, surrounded by the ocean breeze and penguins instead of death and horror. Reality was inescapable and absolute in that moment; it almost managed to break his mind for a third time and crack whatever stability had been achieved in the past days. How easy it would be to simply fall back to a corner, deny any and all interactions and force himself to die. Death was all around, those beings were death incarnate, and coming to remind their maker there was truly no escape.  
真嗣此刻只想别开视线，逃离此地，奔向废墟，躺在地板上，被海风和企鹅环绕，而非死亡与恐怖。现实在那瞬间变得无法逃避，绝对而残酷；它几乎要将他的心智第三次击溃，打破过去几天好不容易建立起的些许稳定。多么容易就能退缩到角落，拒绝一切交流，强迫自己走向灭亡。死亡无处不在，那些存在即是死亡的化身，前来提醒它们的创造者，真正的逃脱是不存在的。

_No. Look at it, and remember. This is what you did, this is what you've done. Take it in, memorize it; these are your mistakes. You have to help in whatever way you can, as much as you possibly can. That is your penance, Shinji.  
不，直视它，记住它。这是你所为，这是你造成的。接受它，铭记它；这些都是你的错误。你必须尽你所能，以任何方式提供帮助。这是你的赎罪，真嗣。_

Most likely it was a figment of his imagination, an aftereffect of so many sleepless nights and sickness, but for a moment he saw movement from within the humanoid figure. He saw something moving, shifting, crying, screaming. He saw men and women and children and dogs and birds, all crammed into the shape of his Evangelion. The wriggled and whimpered in evident agony, unable to escape whatever hellish fate he had condemned them to.  
最有可能这只是他想象中的幻影，是无数不眠之夜和疾病的余波，但有那么一刻，他确实从那个人形物体中看到了动静。他看到有什么东西在移动、在变换、在哭泣、在尖叫。他看到男人、女人、孩子、狗和鸟，全都挤进了他的 EVA 的形状里。他们在明显的痛苦中扭动和呜咽，无法逃脱他所判定的任何地狱般的命运。

Kensuke never realized how close Shinji came to collapsing from shock. He bit the inside of his cheek and clenched his fists, determined to sear the vision into his brain. If there was a way to heal this damage, if there was a way to heal whatever sickness had robbed Asuka of a normal existence, all that was left was to fight for it.  
健介从未意识到真嗣离崩溃有多近。他咬紧了内颊，紧握双拳，决心将这一幕深深烙印在脑海中。如果有办法治愈这种伤害，如果有办法治愈夺走明日香正常生活的疾病，剩下的就是为之奋斗。

"Struggle," he muttered. "To proceed with difficulty, or with great effort."  
“挣扎，”他喃喃自语，“艰难前行，或付出巨大努力。”

---

Sun and heat had been as estranged an experience as actual conversation for as long as she could remember. There had only been her purpose and the orders to be followed, there had only been Eva and the scenario, no thoughts nor decisions to make. Everything was ordained, clear and understandable; seeing the boy face to face had been about the first time true emotion had sprung in her chest.  
阳光与炎热，对她而言，长久以来就像真正的对话一样陌生。她所能记得的，只有她的目标和必须遵循的指令，只有伊娃和剧本，没有思考，也没有选择。一切都是注定的，清晰且可理解；面对面见到那个男孩，是她心中第一次涌起真切的情感。

As she was instructed on how to plant 'rice', the realization came that Gendo Ikari had not ordered her to do so, and yet she was doing it. The kind family who offered shelter and sustenance in the form of delicious meals had also not ordered her to work. The days rolled into one another and her time ticked away along with the plugsuit's clock, and yet she worked. She ate, spoke, went through the books and bathed along with the other female workers.  
当她按照指示学习如何种植'水稻'时，她意识到碇源堂并没有命令她这么做，但她却在做。那户好心提供庇护和美味餐食的家庭也没有要求她工作。日子一天天过去，她的时间与插入栓服上的时钟一同流逝，而她仍在工作。她吃饭、交谈、翻阅书籍，与其他女工一起洗澡。

The world was beautiful. 世界是美丽的。

How peculiar, that she had just recently discovered what the word meant and found it perfect to describe the gentle breeze, fresh water and moist earth. Birds and worms and smiles, sweat and gentle laughter had blended into a new routine, one with continuous learning and surprises at every turn. The days on her own without knowledge of where he was had been challenging at first, with no orders to orient her behavior and no Ikari-kun to follow. She felt compelled to explore, to learn.  
多么奇特，她最近才领悟到这个词的含义，并发现它完美地描述了那轻柔的微风、清澈的水和湿润的泥土。鸟儿、蠕虫和微笑，汗水和温柔的笑声融入了新的日常，每一步都充满了持续的学习和惊喜。独自度过的那些日子，一开始并不容易，没有命令来指导她的行为，也没有碇君可追随。她感到一种探索和学习的冲动。

The villagers and members of the Suzuhara family had coerced her into facing a different existence, going so far as to press her into choosing a name for herself. A name had never been necessary either, she had had a designated number and it had served well enough. A gust of breeze refreshed her flushed cheeks and matted hair; the caress of the wind had also been a pleasant surprise.  
村民们和铃原家的人逼迫她面对一个全新的存在，甚至强迫她为自己挑选一个名字。名字从未是必要的，她原本有一个指定的编号，已经足够应付。一阵微风拂过她泛红的脸颊和凌乱的头发；风的轻抚也成了意外的惊喜。

"Okay, miss Lookalike," the woman next to her exclaimed with a smirk. "That's a good amount of work for the day! Great job! You only fell twice, and not on the sprouts either time." A heavy hand fell on her shoulder and squeezed. Curiosity flared once more, if such was a good enough work day, what would an extreme day feel like? What was an 'easy' work day, then?  
"好的，小模仿者，"她身旁的女人带着一丝讥笑说道，"今天的工作量可不小！干得漂亮！你只摔了两次，而且每次都没压到豆芽。"一只沉甸甸的手搭在她肩上，用力捏了捏。好奇心再次燃起，如果这样的日子算是工作顺利，那么极限日会是什么感觉？那所谓的'轻松'工作日又该是怎样的呢？

"Time to get some fresh water!" yelled one of the younger ones as he ran towards the largest shade available and collapsed underneath it with a happy grunt. "This is the stuff! Great weather, lots of work, lots of fun! Hey, miss Lookalike, come sit with us today!"  
"该去打点新鲜水了！"其中一个年轻人喊道，他朝着最大的阴凉处跑去，满意地哼了一声后瘫倒在其下。"这才叫生活！好天气，多干活，多开心！嘿，像小姐的姑娘，今天来和我们一起坐吧！"

Even as the words rang in her head as orders, they were everything but. She was compelled to follow the young woman more out of wonder than obligation. Fragrant new scents, sensations unlike any other at every corner; food, drink and warmth were everywhere.  
尽管这些话在她脑海中回响如命令，但实际上远非如此。她被吸引着跟随那位年轻女子，更多的是出于好奇而非义务。四处弥漫着新鲜芬芳的香气，每个角落都有前所未有的感觉；食物、饮料和温暖无处不在。

The villagers conversed and inquired about her, not in the slightest discouraged when little more than an inquisitive glance and confused blinking was their response. They mentioned some young man who had come to them years before, broken but curious, and how he had grown to love and care for the village. The tips of her lips quirked whenever the Suzuhara child was mentioned; it was the very incarnation of the word 'cute', and every available chance to interact with the baby instantly became a precious memory.  
村民们与她交谈并询问她的近况，即使她的回应不过是好奇的目光和困惑的眨眼，他们也丝毫不感到气馁。他们提到了多年前来到这里的一个年轻人，虽然受伤但充满好奇心，他如何逐渐爱上并关心这个村庄。每当提到铃原家的孩子时，她的嘴角总会微微上扬；那孩子简直是“可爱”这个词的化身，每一次与他的互动都立刻成为珍贵的回忆。

She sat under the tree with them, hearing stories of how once not too long ago, agriculture to such a level had been but a distant dream. The meal the Horaki lady had prepared was exquisite, yet at a lack of words to describe its flavor, she simply commented it was very good. More smiles and laughter rang through the forest and farmland.  
她与他们一同坐在树下，聆听着不久前农业达到如此水平还只是遥不可及的梦想的故事。堀木女士准备的餐食精美绝伦，然而苦于找不到合适的词汇来形容其风味，她只得简单评价道：“非常美味。”更多的欢声笑语在森林与农田间回荡。

After the break was done, one of the older workers pointed at a hill where a car was parked and two figures had just emerged. The small smile blossomed on her features just as one of the ladies gently nudged her in the car's direction.  
休息结束后，一位年长的工人指向一座小山，那里停着一辆车，两个身影刚刚出现。就在这时，其中一位女士轻轻地推了她一下，示意她朝车的方向走去，她脸上随即绽放出淡淡的微笑。

"Ah, so you have your eye set on someone, don't you, miss mysterious?" the woman inquired with a smug expression. "Is that boy special to you?"  
“啊，看来你心里有人了，不是吗，神秘的小姐？”那位女士带着得意的表情问道，“那个男孩对你来说很特别吗？”

"Special?" Her heart thundered louder when he was near. There was a strange desire to be beside him. "I do not know."  
“特别吗？”他靠近时，她的心跳得更加剧烈。有种莫名的渴望想要待在他身边。“我不清楚。”

'Well, staying here and chatting with us old bats won't help you figure it out. Why don't you go say hi to him? I'm sure Mr. Kensuke's just showing him around."  
“哎，留在这儿跟我们这些老蝙蝠聊天可帮不了你弄明白。干嘛不去跟他打个招呼呢？我敢肯定健介先生只是在带他四处转转。”

She departed with a nod and set out to the top of the hill. The muscles of her legs burned, her chest heaved with strain and a strange excitement, and regardless of fatigue or trepidation, she walked up to where the boy was standing. He was gazing into the distance when she arrived, eyes wide as though fearful or worse, and widened even more upon recognizing her.  
她点头告别，向山顶走去。双腿的肌肉燃烧着，胸口因紧张和莫名的兴奋而剧烈起伏，尽管疲惫或忐忑，她还是走到了男孩站立的地方。她到达时，他正凝视着远方，眼睛睁得大大的，仿佛害怕或更甚，而在认出她后，眼睛睁得更大了。

Special? Yes, he most certainly was. Being near him was pleasant and fulfilling, like the congratulatory words received after performing a task for the work group, or understanding what a word meant and having Hikari congratulate her. The boy's presence alone was as gratifying as those smiles.  
特别？是的，他无疑非常特别。靠近他令人愉快且满足，就像完成工作组任务后得到的祝贺话语，或是理解了一个词义并得到光子的夸奖。男孩的存在本身就如同那些微笑一样令人欣慰。

"Ayanam-oh. Hi," he murmured, and waved with what she assumed was uncertainty.  
“小刚。嗨，”他低声说道，并挥了挥手，她猜想那是不确定的表现。

The adult next to him smiled; he placed a hand on Ikari's shoulder and nudged him forward. "This is where she works during the day. Everyone calls her Miss Lookalike." Ikari nodded in understanding. "I have to go see how the crops are doing. If we have enough this season we can trade with Village 2. See you in a few, Shinji."  
他身旁的成年人微笑着；他将手搭在碇的肩上，轻轻推他向前。“她白天就在这里工作。大家都叫她‘像小姐’。”碇点头表示理解。“我得去看看庄稼长得怎么样。如果这季收成足够，我们就能和二村交易。一会儿见，真嗣。”

They were left alone atop the hill, with the last rays of noon making the air feel moist. The scent of wet earth and fresh water was all around, one she would relate to him for weeks to come. "I did not mean to cause inconvenience yesterday," she started after a few heartbeats of heavy silence. "Are you faring better?"  
他们独自留在山顶，正午的最后一缕阳光让空气显得湿润。四周弥漫着湿土和清水的气息，这味道她将在未来数周里向他细细描述。"我昨天并非有意造成不便，"在几拍沉重的沉默后，她开口道，"你现在感觉好些了吗？"

Ikari hesitated at her inquiry; his gaze shifted over to the fields and the sky before setting on her feet. "N-No reason to apologize," he responded with a tight half-smile. His eyes looked downcast, haunted, yet impossibly determined. "You actually… helped me figure some stuff out." A shaky hand motioned to her work station. "Have you been working here all this time?"  
郁郎在她询问时犹豫了一下；他的目光转向田野和天空，最后落在她的脚上。“没……没什么好道歉的，”他回应时露出了一个紧绷的半笑。他的眼神显得低沉、困扰，却又无比坚定。“你真的……帮我理清了一些事情。”他颤抖的手指向她的工作台。“你一直在这里工作吗？”

"In the mornings… we work here. I have learned how to plant rice." The admission made her feel uncomfortable; what relevance did her learning have? "I have also learned about books, and what certain words mean."  
“早上……我们在这里工作。我学会了种稻。”这个坦白让她感到不安；她学会的这些有什么意义呢？“我还学了书本知识，以及一些词汇的含义。”

Disturbed as it was, Ikari's gaze softened. "That's really great to hear. You know, I wanted to say… thank you. Thanks for talking to me yesterday, even if I wasn't… the best listener."  
尽管心烦意乱，郁郎的目光还是柔和了下来。“这真是太好了。你知道吗，我想说……谢谢你。谢谢你昨天和我聊天，即使我……不是个好听众。”

She had been hearing the words for days on end. Whenever she complied with a request or performed somehow effectively, they would say so as well. "Thank you," repeated the girl with a tilt of her head. "How is one supposed to respond when addressed with these words?"  
她已经连续几天听到这些话了。每当她遵从请求或以某种方式有效完成任务时，他们也会这么说。"谢谢你，"女孩微微侧头重复道，"当别人用这些话来称呼时，应该如何回应呢？"

Shinji blinked, taken aback by the question, yet recovered quickly and felt a fresh pang of indescribable pain. At every waking moment, with every new thing about the world he learned, he felt more and more estranged from his father.  
碇真嗣眨了眨眼，被这个问题惊到，但很快恢复过来，感到一阵难以言喻的新痛。每当他醒来，随着对世界的新知不断累积，他愈发觉得自己与父亲渐行渐远。

"I'm not an expert in this stuff, or even half-good at it," he muttered. The sun burned at his skin and back, a reminder of the scorching heat which had been present the last time he had uttered such words. "But I think you're supposed to say 'you're welcome', and smile."  
"我对这事儿并不在行，甚至可以说半吊子。" 他喃喃自语。阳光灼烧着他的皮肤和背部，让他想起上次说出这些话时那酷热难耐的天气。"但我觉得你应该说‘不客气’，然后微笑。"

"Oh." She blinked in surprise, and did her best to do as advised. It felt overwhelmingly pleasant to smile at him. "You are welcome."  
“哦。”她惊讶地眨了眨眼，尽力按照建议去做。对他微笑的感觉无比愉悦。“不客气。”

He smiled back as best he could, she assumed, but even to her vastly inexperienced perception, the details were there to see. His skin was pale, the smile was strained and trembled along with his body. Something was terribly wrong.  
他尽力回以微笑，她猜想，但即便在她极为缺乏经验的眼中，那些细节也清晰可见。他的肤色苍白，笑容勉强且随着身体的颤抖而颤动。情况显然非常不妙。

Before she could inquire why he looked so distraught, the bespectacled man came and retrieved Ikari. Just as he arrived, he left in a flash. The terrified yet resolute nature of his gaze seared itself into her brain and soul. There was unfathomable suffering behind those cobalt eyes, and yet something had stirred within him and clashed against the fear she remembered from their first interactions. He was vastly different now, and she was bearing witness to a metamorphosis akin to that of the caterpillars she had seen around the leaves.  
在她来得及询问他为何显得如此心烦意乱之前，那位戴眼镜的男子便前来领走了碇。他刚到，便又匆匆离去。他那惊恐却坚定的目光深深烙印在她的脑海与灵魂中。在那双钴蓝色眼眸背后，隐藏着难以言喻的痛苦，然而某种力量在他内心涌动，与她记忆中初次相遇时的恐惧产生了冲突。他已截然不同，而她正目睹着一场蜕变，如同她在叶片间见过的毛毛虫化蝶般的转变。

Indeed, Ikari-kun was special to her.  
确实，碇君对她来说是特别的。

While wandering back to the group with a deep sense of satisfaction and the desire to know of his whereabouts, Rei wondered what he would do now, which path he would follow. Would he join her in the rice fields? Would he choose to pilot the Evangelion? Would he follow through with the scenario his father had devised?  
在带着深深的满足感和想要知道他行踪的渴望回到队伍时，丽思索着他现在会做什么，他会选择哪条道路。他会加入她在稻田的工作吗？他会选择驾驶福音战士吗？他会按照他父亲设计的剧本走下去吗？

Long after the work day had ended, while she lay in the hot bath with the other females of the work group and curiously eavesdropped on their gossip, the question bubbled in her chest. She wanted to know where he would be working; there was no need to ask if he'd be working or not. As it had become a custom in the bathhouse, they inquired about her name, and the reluctance to pick one for herself.  
工作日的漫长时光早已结束，当她与其他工作组的妇女们一起躺在热气腾腾的浴池中，好奇地偷听着她们的闲聊时，这个问题在她胸中翻腾。她想知道他会在哪里工作；是否工作已无需询问。正如浴室中的惯例，她们询问她的名字，以及她对选择一个名字的犹豫不决。

She chose to ask Ikari for a name instead. Spending time with him and with Tsubame, spending time with everyone who welcomed with open arms and enthusiasm felt so much more incredibly compelling than fulfilling her predisposed duty.  
她选择向碇请求一个名字。与他和燕共度时光，与所有热情张开双臂欢迎她的人相处，这一切都比履行她预设的职责更加令人难以抗拒。

For the first time ever since her creation, she knew fear. She feared the coming of an Impact, the erasure of all she was learning to cherish.  
自她诞生以来，这是她第一次感受到恐惧。她害怕即将到来的冲击，那将抹去她所学会珍视的一切。

_They're not the same person.  
他们不是同一个人。_

He had said those same words to Ayanami once after a hellish battle, after believing she had been basically vaporized before his eyes. True, both shared the same features, hair and eye color, height, skin hue and tone of voice; however, they were completely different individuals.  
在一次地狱般的战斗后，他曾对绫波说过同样的话，当时他以为她已经在自己眼前被彻底蒸发。确实，两人有着相同的外貌、发色、眼睛颜色、身高、肤色和声音的音调；然而，他们是完全不同的个体。

Rei's gaze had held a level of self-awareness and resignation, a certain sadness most likely born out of understanding the implications of her purpose, the implications of his father's deeds and plans. It had felt as though they had been long estranged siblings after a while; he had envied her close relationship with his father, gone through many a battle with her by his side, and had even come close to having a proper dinner with her and his father before calamity stole it all away.  
零的目光中透露出一种自我认知与无奈，那股悲伤多半源于她对自己使命的理解，以及对他父亲行为和计划的深知。一时间，他们仿佛成了久别重逢的兄妹；他曾羡慕她与父亲之间的亲密关系，与她并肩作战无数次，甚至险些能与她和父亲共进一顿正式的晚餐，却终究被灾难夺走了这一切。

Whoever this Rei lookalike was, she was an individual of her own. Her gaze sparkled with interest wherever it rested, her way of expressing emotion was also different. Her smile was different; much less guarded and natural, almost relaxed and pure in a way. The Rei he remembered was gone, forever trapped inside Unit 01's core most likely, and now this stranger with her face smiled at him and said that his existence was not unpleasant to her.  
无论这个酷似零的女孩是谁，她都是独一无二的个体。她的目光所及之处闪烁着好奇的光芒，表达情感的方式也截然不同。她的笑容不同；少了许多戒备，显得自然而放松，甚至带着几分纯净。他记忆中的零已经消失，很可能永远被困在初号机的核心里，而现在这位有着她面容的陌生人正对他微笑，告诉他她的存在并不令她感到不快。

_I told her she should smile. What a generic thing to say. No wonder Asuka calls me a brat and an idiot all the time.  
我告诉她应该笑一笑。这话说得真俗套。难怪明日香总叫我小鬼和白痴。_

The shapes of women, men, children and animals composing the Wanderer's body flashed into Shinji's mind without remorse, accompanied by the now familiar spray of blood as Kaworu exploded. He was somehow able to keep breakfast within his belly, and regardless of his best efforts the sudden tremor alerted Kensuke instantly.  
各种女性、男性、儿童和动物的形态在流浪者的身体中闪现，无情地闯入真嗣的脑海，伴随着卡罗尔爆炸时熟悉的血雾。他不知怎的还能把早餐留在胃里，尽管他尽了最大努力，那突如其来的颤抖还是立刻引起了健介的注意。

"You sure you're okay there, Ikari?" Kensuke inquired with a raised eyebrow. "I told you last night. It might be too soon. You've just barely recovered from that infection."  
“你确定没事吗，真嗣？”健介挑着眉毛问道，“昨晚我就说了，可能还太早。你才刚刚从那次感染中恢复过来。”

"I'm fine," Shinji ground out, shaking his head in an effort to erase the vision from his thoughts. "Maybe the heat got to me a little."  
"我没事，" 真嗣咬牙说道，摇了摇头试图从脑海中抹去那幅画面。"可能是热气让我有点不舒服。"

"Yeah, the weather's been weird lately. Cold, windy afternoons and hot, humid mornings. Sucks with the humidity at night, as well. Did you manage to sleep at all?"  
“是啊，最近天气挺反常的。下午冷风阵阵，早上又闷热潮湿。晚上湿度大也难受。你睡得着吗？”

Kensuke had snored lightly during the night, both before and after Shinji had requested to tag along. Perhaps three or four hours had gone by without him noticing. "I think so." _If he thinks you're too weak he won't let you work. You won't make a difference. If you're tired, that's your problem._ "I slept well enough," he lied after a second's hesitation. "Where are we going next? I think I can do that work near the pillar just fine."  
健介在夜里轻轻地打鼾，无论是真嗣请求同行之前还是之后。或许有三四个小时他都没注意到。“我想是的。”如果他认为你太弱，他就不会让你工作。你不会有什么影响的。如果你累了，那是你自己的问题。“我睡得挺好，”他犹豫了一秒后撒谎道，“我们接下来去哪儿？我觉得我能在柱子附近的工作做得很好。”

"Yeah, you did quite well for your first day! But that station is a bit too far, I think something a little closer would be better." Aida smirked upon noticing how often Shinji massaged the injured hand.  
“是啊，你第一天表现得很不错！不过那个站点有点太远了，我觉得找个稍微近一点的地方会更好。”艾达注意到真嗣频繁地按摩受伤的手，不禁露出了得意的笑容。

_He's been putting up a brave front for the better part of the afternoon,_ Kensuke mused. _Shikinami won't be happy if that cuts gets infected again._ "We're going to Toji's. You know, where you were yesterday? Hikari's dad is in charge of supplying three more families with lumber, but he's been having lots of muscle spasms and back pain lately. Toji says he's worked himself into a bed. Think you can handle a little more hard work?"  
他整个下午大部分时间都表现得相当勇敢，真嗣暗自思忖。要是那个伤口再次感染，明日香可不会高兴。“我们要去东治家。你知道的，就是你昨天去的地方。光里的爸爸负责为另外三家供应木材，但他最近肌肉痉挛和背痛得厉害。东治说他已经累得卧床不起了。你觉得你能应付一些更辛苦的工作吗？”

"Yeah." said Shinji, and closed his hand into a tentative fist; the wound was not searing as it had been earlier.  
“嗯。” 真嗣说道，并试探性地握紧了拳头；伤口已不如先前那般灼痛。

Kensuke knew the majority of the labor was done. Viko was overzealous with the lumber work, always willing to dice old trees, study the soil and decide which species was appropriate to grow where the old one had stood. The strange botany enthusiast even went as far as uprooting the dead stumps and utilizing every available part. With wood being already diced in sizable portions, it was only a matter of loading them into a cart and transporting the cargo back to the houses.  
健介知道大部分的劳作已经完成。维科对木材工作异常热衷，总是乐于砍伐老树，研究土壤，并决定哪种树种适合在旧树的位置生长。这位奇特的植物爱好者甚至不惜连根拔起枯死的树桩，充分利用每一部分。既然木材已经切割成适当的大小，剩下的不过是将它们装上推车，运回住所罢了。

"The old man's not even supposed to be doing anything anymore, he's just stubborn. An extra pair of hands is not that common to come across, so I'm sure he'll appreciate the help," Kensuke added, already knowing the eldest member of the household was proud and brash. "Just don't overdo it, okay? You'll be helping with gathering wood and bringing it to the families. It's mostly unproblematic, I think you'll enjoy the peace and quiet of the forest. You can work with them through the afternoon. I'm sure Miss Lookalike will come along at some point, so you can ask her about work in the fields and stuff."  
"那老人家本不该再操劳了，他就是倔。多一双帮忙的手可不常见，我敢说他一定会感激这份帮助的，"健介补充道，心里清楚家里这位长辈既骄傲又急躁。"只是别太逞强，好吗？你主要负责捡柴火，送到各家去。基本上没什么麻烦事，我想你会喜欢森林里的宁静。下午你就跟他们一起干活。我估计那位长得像你的人会过来，到时候你可以问问她田里工作的事儿。"

"Right, Toji's house," Shinji's acknowledged, distracted. He vaguely remembered the living room, the amiable environment, the scent of stew, and the endearing gurgles and yelps of a newborn child. "I'll help however I can."  
"对，碇的家，"真嗣应道，有些心不在焉。他隐约记得那个客厅，温馨的氛围，炖菜的香气，还有新生儿可爱的咕噜声和啼哭声。"我会尽力帮忙的。"

"That's the spirit!" Kensuke said and chuckled. "Remember, today's just about browsing along. We can take a couple of days to see what actually works for you."  
"这就对了！" 健介笑着说，"记住，今天就是随便逛逛。我们可以花几天时间看看什么真正适合你。"

"Okay." Shinji nodded, not paying much attention once more. _Help in whatever way you can. Choose to help. Choose, and struggle. It's the only thing you can do._  
"好的。" 真嗣点点头，再次心不在焉。尽你所能去帮助。选择去帮助。做出选择，并为之奋斗。这是你唯一能做的事。

From a distance, he saw another bipedal monster collapse atop the barrier.  
从远处，他看到另一只双足怪物倒在了屏障之上。

The eyes of a little girl opened from within the crevices of the Wanderer's limbs. It was impossible to see such a detail from so far away, yet it still manifested in his mind. Shinji's hand clenched against the track suit as the image manifested. Peace and quiet? Forest? Lovely. Anything to get away from the memory of that horrid figure clawing at the barrier and trying to destroy everything the villagers had built. Finding that seed had felt like a step in the right direction. He was trying, doing his best to help as the stranger had advised, and in return the villagers whose lives he had ruined smiled away and gave him reassuring pats on the back.  
一个小女孩的眼睛从旅者四肢的缝隙中睁开。从那么远的地方不可能看到这样的细节，但它仍然在他的脑海中显现。真嗣的手紧握着运动服，随着这幅画面的显现。和平与宁静？森林？太好了。任何能让他逃离那个可怕身影抓挠屏障、试图摧毁村民们所建一切的记忆的东西。找到那颗种子，感觉像是朝着正确的方向迈出了一步。他在努力，尽自己最大的努力去帮助，正如那位陌生人所建议的那样，而那些他曾毁掉生活的村民们，微笑着，给予他安慰的拍背。

_Earn those smiles, earn the right to be here Earn. Earn._ Shinji's mind became foggier with every passing moment. The guilt closed in just like the beasts attempting to crush all life that existed within the barrier. Asuka's glare followed like a predator every time he considered running away or shutting himself off as he had done on the Wunder. _Do whatever you can. Earn. Earn._  
赢得那些微笑，赢得留在这里的权利。赢得。赢得。真嗣的思绪随着每一刻的流逝而变得越发模糊。罪恶感如试图碾碎屏障内所有生命的野兽般逼近。明日香的眼神如捕食者般紧随其后，每当他考虑逃跑或像在 Wunder 上那样封闭自己时。尽你所能。赢得。赢得。

_No matter what. 无论发生什么。_

Shinji's mind drifted back to the image of a disgruntled gentleman sitting across from him. Even if he had not eaten much of the stew himself, none of it had gone to waste in the end. However, the plate served to him the day before had remained untouched while he whimpered in a corner and tried to disappear. _Running away into some ruins isn't an option anymore,_ he realized. The image of the headless figure continued to follow him.  
真嗣的思绪飘回到了对面那位不满的绅士身上。尽管他自己并没有吃多少炖菜，但最终也没有浪费。然而，前一天端给他的盘子却原封不动，他蜷缩在角落里呜咽，试图消失。他意识到，逃进废墟已经不再是选项了。那个无头身影的画面一直萦绕在他心头。

The now familiar visage of the Suzuhara household came into view.  
如今熟悉的铃原家的面孔映入眼帘。

_I don't even know why I'm trying. I'll never be able to take all of that back. I tried… and Kaworu died for it, Asuka almost died for it. Misato, Sakura, everyone on the Wunder, everyone in this village would have been wiped off the face of the earth. I wanted to restart everything, rewrite the world to something that was familiar to me. Something that didn't hurt.  
我甚至不知道自己为何还在尝试。我永远无法挽回这一切。我试过了……而渚薰为此付出了生命，明日香差点为此丧命。美里、樱、Wunder 上的每一个人，这个村子里的所有人，都可能从地球上被抹去。我想要重启一切，重写世界，让它变得对我来说熟悉，不再痛苦。_

The small child in Hikari's arms, Kensuke's confident smile, Toji's mature gaze, the laughs and jokes of the villagers on their daily activities; he would have erased it all in an effort to wipe away his wrongdoings. It had not once occurred to him during his quest to take the spears that perhaps some of the survivors might not have been too happy about his desire. He had simply assumed that restarting it all and erasing his mistakes from the very fabric of existence was the only logical path.  
光怀里的小孩，健介自信的微笑，冬二成熟的目光，村民们日常生活中的欢声笑语；他本会为了抹去自己的过错而将这一切尽数抹除。在他追寻长矛的过程中，从未想过有些幸存者可能并不乐见他的愿望。他只是简单地认为，重启一切并从存在的根基上抹去自己的错误，是唯一合乎逻辑的道路。

However strenuous the task had been, life had prospered within the haven of the barrier. Those who had withstood the onslaught of the Angels, Impacts, famine, disease and war had not come out unscathed, but they were stronger than before. Life was difficult, and yet they smiled and laughed and bore no ill will.  
尽管任务艰巨，生命却在屏障的庇护所内蓬勃发展。那些经受住了使徒、冲击、饥荒、疾病和战争猛烈袭击的人们虽未毫发无伤，却比以往更为坚强。生活虽艰难，但他们依然微笑、欢笑，心中无怨无恨。

"We're here," Kensuke announced with a somewhat defeated voice. "Don't take the grumpy old man too seriously, okay? I brought him some sake last time, so he should be fine."  
“我们到了。”健介用一种略显沮丧的声音宣布道，“别太在意那个脾气暴躁的老头，好吗？上次我给他带了些清酒，他应该没事的。”

Shinji hesitated before exiting the car. He had been in the house before, yet many of the details of his visit were in a fog, with a constant low hum thundering in his ears. "Is he injured?" he inquired while looking at the gauze. "I'll help in any way I can so he can heal."  
真嗣犹豫了一下才下车。他之前来过这栋房子，但许多细节都模糊不清，耳边始终回荡着低沉的轰鸣声。“他受伤了吗？”他看着绷带问道，“我会尽我所能帮助他康复。”

"He's not _injured_, he's just old and stubborn. Don't worry about it. And like I said, don't overdo it. We don't want that wound festering again, do we?"  
“他没受伤，只是年纪大了又固执。别担心。就像我说的，别过度劳累。我们可不想那伤口再化脓，对吧？”

They were welcomed at the door by Hikari and the baby, with the former wasting no time to explain him how the cart worked and how much firewood was advisable to carry on every trip. Kensuke bid farewell and departed, telling them both there was another pipeline that needed repairing. After understanding how to properly roll the cart through the irregular terrain, Shinji set off to the clearing the former class rep had pointed him towards, but was halted in his tracks when a hand fell on his shoulder.  
他们在门口受到了光和婴儿的欢迎，前者立刻向他解释了手推车的使用方法以及每次旅行应携带多少柴火。健介告别了他们，告诉他们还有另一条管道需要修理。在了解了如何正确地推着手推车通过不平坦的地形后，真嗣朝着前班代表指给他的那片空地出发，但当他肩膀被一只手按住时，他停下了脚步。

"You probably haven't eaten a thing, have you?" Hikari pointed at his sweaty attire. "Those could use a little washing, as well. Come on, I'm sure I saw some more of Toji's old stuff yesterday. Let's get you some lunch and make sure you have a fresh change of clothes for when you're done, hmm?"  
“你大概什么都没吃吧，是不是？”光指着他满是汗水的衣服说，“这些也该洗洗了。来吧，我记得昨天还看到一些冬二以前的旧衣服。我们先让你吃点午饭，再确保你洗完澡有干净衣服换，嗯？”

_You will eat. You will take care of yourself. You will not starve. You will struggle, Shinji, and maybe if you suffer enough, eventually you'll get your permission.  
你会吃饭。你会照顾好自己。你不会挨饿。你会挣扎，真嗣，也许如果你受够了苦，最终你会得到许可。_

"Oh, right." Shinji nodded and followed without much thought. "Sorry."  
“哦，对。” 真嗣点点头，没多想就跟上了。“抱歉。”

"No need to apologize! Now come on, I have some delicious soup and fresh rice ready to go!"  
“不用道歉！快来，我准备了美味的汤和新鲜米饭！”

The young woman's demeanor had evolved, Shinji noticed. Hikari still oozed authority with every word, but now it felt more nurturing than commanding. He recalled that the Rei he had recently met was staying with them, and found himself smiling as he entered the house. It eased the pain in his chest to know the young woman with Ayanami's features could experience something akin to a mother.  
真嗣注意到，这位年轻女性的举止已经发生了变化。尽管每一句话中，光依然流露出权威，但现在更多是关怀而非命令。他想起最近遇到的那个和绫波有着相似面容的丽正和他们住在一起，不禁微笑着走进屋子。知道这位有着绫波特征的年轻女性能体验到类似母爱的情感，这减轻了他胸中的痛楚。

He thought back on Misato, and his stomach twisted with guilt, anger and despair; he had no appetite despite the morning's hard labor. The rations Asuka had placed in the car remained untouched as well, because he was too nauseated by the image of the headless beings to eat.  
他回想起美里，愧疚、愤怒和绝望在胃里翻腾，尽管一早辛劳，他却毫无食欲。明日香放在车里的口粮同样未曾动过，因为他被那些无头身影的画面恶心得吃不下东西。

Despite the sickness running through his belly, Shinji emptied the soup bowl and ate as much of the rice as his stomach allowed. It was happening again; he kept losing track of time and where he was, or what he was supposed to be doing. The sensation was disturbingly similar to the quiet horror Fuyutsuki's explanation had brought about, only this time there had been no need for anybody to explain a thing.  
尽管腹中病痛缠绕，真嗣还是喝光了汤，尽可能多地吃了些米饭。这种情况再次发生了；他不断失去时间感和身处何地，或是应该做什么。这种感觉与副司令冬月解释时带来的静谧恐惧惊人地相似，只是这次无需任何人解释任何事情。

Some silence and quiet work by the woods was sure to calm the festering anxiousness inside his ribcage.  
在树林中静静地待上一会儿，定能平息胸腔内溃烂的焦虑。

Moments ticked by in relative silence. Minutes, hours? He was unaware of how many, and only he came to when the man he assumed to be Hikari's father sat opposite to him at the table and glared. For once ever since arriving at the village, another person besides Asuka stared at him with displeasure.  
相对寂静中，片刻悄然流逝。几分钟，几小时？他不知道过了多久，直到他注意到一个他认为是光里父亲的男人坐在桌对面，瞪着他。自从来到村子以来，除了明日香，终于有另一个人带着不满的眼神盯着他。

"Good to see you didn't choose to waste good food this time around," the eldest member of the household growled. His eyes narrowed at Shinji. "Look at you, scrawny and broken. How much help can you possibly off-"  
"很高兴看到这次你没有选择浪费好食物。"家中最年长的成员咆哮道。他眯起眼睛盯着真嗣，"看看你，瘦弱又颓废。你能帮上什么忙——"

"Father, that's enough." Hikari was quick to reprimand her father, but Shinji felt no true animosity radiate off his tone. "You should be happy Shinji's here to help us out today. Toji's been really busy lately, as well, and Tsubame is a handful on her own. We need all the help we can get."  
"爸爸，够了。" 光立刻责备她的父亲，但真嗣感觉他的语气中并没有真正的敌意。"你应该高兴真嗣今天来帮我们。最近东治也很忙，燕子一个人也够呛。我们需要所有能得到的帮助。"

The man's gaze held not a bit of the hatred seen within the confines of the Wunder; he was mildly annoyed at best. "Some help he's gonna be if can't even articulate a damn sentence. Heh, youngsters these days. They just expect everything to be handed to them. Do you know what you're supposed to do, boy?"  
男人的目光中没有一丝在 Wunder 内部所见的仇恨；他最多只是有些不悦。"如果连一句话都说不清楚，他能帮上什么忙？呵，现在的年轻人。他们就指望一切都送到他们手上。小子，你知道你该做什么吗？"

Shinji's head rose and he nodded, trying to appear determined. "Yes, sir. I'm to carry the firewood to the houses two blocks and a block from here respectively, then place the cart back behind the house and carry the firewood to the back."  
真嗣抬起头，努力表现出坚定的样子。"是的，先生。我要把柴火分别送到这里两个街区和一个街区外的房子，然后把推车放回房子后面，再把柴火搬到后面。"

"Meh, I can't even walk up to the door without a cane right now, so you'll have to suffice." The man gave Shinji another measured look and nodded to his daughter; the baby needed attending so Hikari excused herself and moved to the other room. "My name is Bunzaemon," he added once they were alone, and poured himself a small glass of sake. "I hear you were my daughter's schoolmate forever ago. This must all be very strange, I bet."  
“唉，我现在连走到门口都得拄拐杖，所以你就凑合着吧。”男人又仔细打量了真嗣一番，然后朝女儿点点头；婴儿需要照顾，于是光子道了声歉，移步到另一个房间。“我叫文左卫门，”他等两人独处时补充道，并给自己倒了杯小酒。“听说你很久以前是我女儿的同学。这肯定很奇怪吧，我猜。”

"It is," Shinji admitted. Once more he tried to smile, once more he failed miserably. At the very least the man's words were helping anchor him to the present. "Most times it just feels like a nightmare that I can't wake up from, but..." He thought back on Ryoji, the workers around the pillar, the sound of laughter in the rice fields, and Tsubame's giggles. He thought back on Rei's smile. "Other times it's… beautiful."  
“确实如此，”真嗣承认道。他再次尝试微笑，却又一次惨败。至少这个男人的话帮助他锚定在当下。“大多数时候，这感觉就像一个无法醒来的噩梦，但是……”他回想起莲二，柱子周围的工人们，稻田里的笑声，以及燕的咯咯笑声。他想起了绫波的微笑。“其他时候，它是……美丽的。”

"It's a complicated existence we have here. Neither village can survive on its own." Bunzaemon's gaze turned into a light glare. "Things haven't been easy. We manage somehow, though. And yes, there are many beautiful things to enjoy, excluding back pain and old age of course." The elder Horaki drank and sighed in contentment. "Give it your best, Shinji. And don't you dare reject my daughter's cooking again, young man."  
“我们这里的生活很复杂。两个村子都无法独自生存。”文左卫门的目光变得有些严厉。“事情并不容易。不过我们总算勉强应付。当然，除了背痛和老年之外，还是有很多美好的事物可以享受。”老者长长地喝了一口，满足地叹息。“尽你最大的努力，真嗣。还有，你小子可别再拒绝我女儿的料理了。”

For the second time in what felt like weeks a small involuntary tug pulled at the corners of Shinji's lips, and a tiny chuckle escaped his chest. "I'll be sure not to." His hand clenched and unclenched; the wound wasn't burning. "I don't know if doing any of these tiny things will ever make a difference. Everything that's happened is… my fault, after all. Whenever I think of th-"  
在仿佛数周以来的第二次，一丝不由自主的微笑牵动了真嗣的嘴角，他胸中不禁发出一声轻笑。“我一定会注意的。”他的手紧握又松开；伤口并未灼痛。“我不确定做这些小事是否能带来任何改变。毕竟，发生的一切……都是我的错。每当我想到——”

"The smallest good deed is better than the grandest good intention."  
“最微小的善行胜过最宏伟的善意。”

Shinji's jaw clenched shut, eyes wide.  
真嗣的下颌紧闭，眼睛睁得大大的。

"Doesn't look like it'll rain this afternoon," Bunzaemon carried on, and pointed out to the trees. "There's work to be done. Focus on what you can do, not on what you can't. I think the commander's had it right all along, a bit of time alone would do wonders for you. The clearing is quiet, and not that many people go through the path. If you want to think, think while you work."  
“今天下午看起来不会下雨，”文左卫门继续说道，并指向树林。“还有工作要做。专注于你能做的，而不是你不能做的。我认为指挥官一直是对的，一点独处的时间会对你大有裨益。这片空地很安静，没有多少人经过这条小路。如果你想思考，就在工作中思考吧。”

It dawned on him that Kensuke, the crew around the pillar, the farmers around the fields and Toji's family were all accommodating him, expecting him to choose what he wanted to do, not forcing him on a preordained path. It felt refreshing to choose something and not have the world end because of it.  
他突然意识到，围绕着柱子的船员健介，田地旁的农夫们，还有冬二的家人，他们都在包容他，期待他选择自己想做的事，而非强迫他走上一条预定的道路。能够做出选择，而不因这个选择导致世界末日，这种感觉令人耳目一新。

"I'll get to work right away." Shinji rose and headed for the door, pausing to turn to the elder and bow respectfully. "Thank you, sir."  
"我这就开始工作。" 真嗣起身向门口走去，停下脚步转身向长者恭敬地鞠了一躬。"谢谢您，先生。"

"Get Hikari to give you a pair of gloves; you won't want your hands filled with blisters for weeks on end. It normally takes me about four trips to get the entire thing done." The man nodded and poured himself another drink. "Two of the families I deliver the firewood to need it for their respective work stations. If you can't handle more than two trips, you'll do the rest tomorrow. Understood?"  
"让光给你拿一副手套，你不会想手上起泡持续几周的。通常我得跑四趟才能全部搞定。" 那人点点头，又给自己倒了杯酒。"我送柴火的两个家庭需要它们来给各自的工作台取暖。如果你连两趟都应付不了，剩下的就明天再做。明白了吗？"

"Yes, sir." The man's directions felt more like grumpy advice than commands, which elicited another minuscule smile from Shinji. "I'll be sure to help as much as I can."  
“是的，先生。”那人的指示听起来更像是抱怨的建议而非命令，这让真嗣又露出了一个微小的微笑。“我会尽力帮忙的。”

"Don't overwork yourself like I did, I only need your help for today and tomorrow so don't get comfortable with the job, either," Bunzaemon leaned back on the wall and watched the boy leave. Even when he smiled, the quiet dread in his eyes did not wane nor dissipate.  
“别像我那样过度劳累，我只需要你今天和明天的帮助，所以也不要对这个工作太习惯，”文左卫门靠在墙上，看着男孩离开。即使他微笑，眼中那无声的恐惧也没有减弱或消散。

"He's actually a very nice kid," Bunzaemon mused. Shinji Ikari was anything but a harbinger of death or a villainous figure. As the hours ticked by and he watched him carry the small cart into the woods and back, he realized how right his daughter had been. "What a terrible card life has dealt him. So alone, like that Shikinami girl. No wonder."  
“他其实是个很好的孩子，”文左卫门沉思道。碇真嗣绝非死亡的预兆或邪恶的形象。随着时间的流逝，他看着他搬着小车进出森林，意识到女儿的话是多么正确。“命运给了他一张多么糟糕的牌。如此孤独，就像那个式波女孩。难怪。”

From the corner of his eye, he saw a flash of red and green when the Second Child disappeared behind a tree. He smiled.  
从眼角，他瞥见第二适格者消失在一棵树后时闪过一抹红绿。他笑了。

"No wonder." "难怪。"

---

"_There are, it seems, inefficient emotions. They were just designed to match the cognitive behavior of humans. You are a part of the Ayanami Series. You were regulated to have a strong liking to the Third Child. Your feelings right now were arranged by NERV from the start."_  
"似乎存在一些效率低下的情感。它们只是为了匹配人类的认知行为而设计的。你是绫波系列的一部分。你被设定为对第三适格者有强烈的喜爱。你现在的心情从一开始就是由 NERV 安排的。"

"_I see. That is good then, because I feel good."_  
"我明白了。那很好，因为我感觉很好。"

The forest leaves were moist enough so as not to crack or make any unnecessary noises as she trotted behind the cart. Following the Ayanami clone had not been part of her evening plans, yet after a few seconds of lying in bed and listening as she faded into the distance, her body had moved on its own.  
森林的叶片湿润得恰到好处，她跟在推车后面小跑时，没有发出任何不必要的声响。追踪绫波零的克隆体并非她傍晚计划的一部分，然而在床上躺了几秒，听着她的脚步声渐行渐远后，她的身体便不由自主地行动了起来。

"_If that's the case, do as you like. The object of your affection should be around the Suzuhara household right about now. Make sure to ask if he's eaten or not."_  
既然如此，你随意就好。你心心念念的那位现在应该就在铃原家附近。记得问问他是否吃过饭了。

"_Thank you."_ "谢谢。"

"_Whatever."_ "随便。"

Shinji was on his way for a third trip, having peeled off the sweater and sweating profusely. The brat did not stop to so much as drink water in between trips. There was a new, unfamiliar level of detachment in his gaze and body language; he was not sluggish when moving, but almost robotic. When Toji's neighbors nodded and thanked him for the firewood, all he did was lower his head and nod. Always unable to hold their gazes, always wanting to simply go back to the task at hand.  
真嗣正准备进行第三次搬运，他已经脱掉了毛衣，汗流浃背。那小子连喝水的时间都不给自己，一次又一次地不停歇。他的眼神和肢体语言中流露出一种新的、陌生的超然；他的动作并不迟缓，而是近乎机械。当东治的邻居们向他点头致谢，感谢他送来的柴火时，他只是低下头点点头。总是无法直视他们的目光，总是只想回到手头的任务上。

_What am I doing? 我在做什么？_

She had asked herself the same question the night before, days before when entering his cage or when giving away her jacket, and still it remained unanswered. As a prisoner and an asset for Gendo Ikari's plans, Shinji was to be monitored and followed, or so Misato had muttered in between gritted teeth once or twice. It had long since been determined that he was neither a danger to himself nor others as long as an Evangelion was not in the vicinity.  
前一晚，甚至更早之前，当她走进他的牢笼或送出自己的夹克时，她也曾问过自己同样的问题，但始终未得其解。作为碇源堂计划中的囚犯和资产，真嗣需要被监视和跟踪，至少美里曾一两次咬牙切齿地嘀咕过。很久以前就已确定，只要没有使徒在附近，他就不会对自己或他人构成危险。

There was no need for her to be standing behind a tree and counting the minutes and seconds it took Shinji to carry the cart back uphill. There was certainly no need for her to sneak around the damned village so as to ensure Shinji did not collapse, and yet there she was, wasting her time and running the unnecessary risk of being seen.  
她没有必要站在树后，计算真嗣把推车推回山坡所需的分分秒秒。当然也没有必要在那个该死的村庄里鬼鬼祟祟，以确保真嗣不会倒下，然而她却站在那里，浪费时间，冒着不必要的被发现的风险。

_He's taken an extra three minutes and forty seven seconds this time around. Add the two and a half minutes from the last trip. He tripped twice on the way down last time as well. Idiot.  
这次他多花了三分钟四十七秒。加上上次的两分半钟。上次下山时他也摔倒了两次。笨蛋。_

Being constantly reminded of activation time during the arduous years of her childhood, there was a constant ticking in her head which had only worsened when sleep had stopped being a bodily need and turned into a luxury. The clock was running at all times, just not for her.  
在童年艰难岁月中不断被提醒激活时间的存在，她的脑海里始终回荡着滴答声，而当睡眠不再是身体的需求，变成了一种奢侈时，这种滴答声愈发加剧。时钟一直在走，却不是为她而转。

The mop of dark brown hair became visible from a distance. Rei had called after her before entering the house, surely to get more specific instructions as to how to ask whether the Third had eaten or not. Judging by how efficiently he moved despite the stiffness, it was safe to assume he was not about to collapse from emaciation. Her position allowed a clear view of the clearing and the mountain of chopped stumps covered by plastic, the path connecting to the neighboring homes, and the roof of Hikari's house.  
远处的暗棕色发丝逐渐清晰可见。Rei 在进屋前曾叫住她，想必是为了得到更具体的指示，询问第三是否已经用餐。尽管动作略显僵硬，但他移动得如此高效，可以断定他并未因饥饿而濒临崩溃。她的位置让她能清楚地看到空地和覆盖着塑料的木桩堆，通往邻家的小径，以及 Hikari 家的屋顶。

Years of avoiding people had made her an expert of sorts in going about unannounced and unseen, or so she liked to believe. Local residents and children did not even try to engage her, with children mostly being surprised by her plugsuit or eyepatch. The younger ones always pointed with that shocked look in their eyes, whilst the adults hurried off and tried to avoid eye contact; she was a freak of nature and had one of humanity's enemies snoozing comfortably within her body, after all. The choker did not much help matters, but with the proper lighting and the use of mostly abandoned trails she could maneuver in relative anonymity.  
多年避世让她自认为成了某种程度上的潜行专家，能悄无声息地来去自如。当地居民和孩子们甚至不愿与她交流，孩子们多半是对她的连体服或眼罩感到惊讶。年幼者总是瞪大眼睛指指点点，而成年人则匆匆避开，尽量避免眼神接触；毕竟，她是个自然界的怪胎，体内还舒适地沉睡着人类的敌人。那条项圈并未改善局面，但在适当的光线和偏僻小径的掩护下，她仍能相对隐秘地行动。

_Now he took a full extra minute and a half to rest,_ she realized, and stole a glance at the panting Third Child. His shirt was all but drenched in sweat, every few moments he'd clench the hand with the bandages as if to ensure the wound was not bleeding, and as he carried up the last handful of logs, Shinji did stop to drink some water.  
现在他多花了一分半钟来休息，她意识到，并偷瞄了一眼喘着粗气的三子。他的衬衫几乎被汗水浸透，每隔一会儿，他就会紧握缠着绷带的手，仿佛在确认伤口没有流血，而当他扛起最后几根木头时，真嗣确实停下来喝了点水。

_Finally. A few more second and you would've started feeling light-headed from dehydration. Stupid brat, can't even keep proper care of your own damn bodily needs. Look at you, sweating all over the place, getting that damned cut infected with toxins and dirt, and all for what? So the monkey's neighbors have enough freaking firewood.  
终于。再过几秒，你就要因脱水而感到头晕了。愚蠢的小鬼，连自己身体的基本需求都照顾不好。看看你，浑身是汗，那该死的伤口被毒素和污垢感染，这一切都是为了什么？就为了让猴子的邻居们有足够的柴火。_

Her fists clenched within the jacket. _This is so stupid. Why am I even here?_  
她的拳头在夹克里紧握。这太蠢了。我为什么还要待在这儿？

'Unfair' was a term she kept from using at all costs. Moaning and complaining that life had been cruel to her from the first moment had brought naught but more anger and more despondence. Unfair was the very nature of existence, why would his be any different?  
“不公平”这个词她一直尽量避免使用。抱怨和哀叹生活从一开始就对她不公，只会带来更多的愤怒和更深的绝望。不公平是存在的本质，他的生活又怎么会例外呢？

The unease returned with a vengeance after Shinji dropped one of the stumps by accident, the dry wood fell from his grasp and scraped against the wound on his wrist. Her eye twitched with annoyance, heartbeat increasing and settling back once the boy retrieved the log; she was too far away to see if there was any actual bleeding or suppuration.  
不安感在真嗣不小心掉落一根树桩后猛然回归，干枯的木头从他手中滑落，擦过他手腕上的伤口。她因恼怒而眼角抽搐，心跳加速又随着男孩捡起木头而平复；她离得太远，看不清是否有实际的出血或化脓。

_It's fine,_ the Major snapped in her mind. _He has an entire entourage of people to cater to his needs. Toji, Kensuke, Hikari, the villagers, freaking Viko of all people, the Ayanami clone falling head over heels for him. Nobody down here is trying to kill him or hold him accountable for…_  
没事的，她脑海中传来司令官的厉声回应。他有一大群人伺候着他的需求。剑介、真希波、光、村民们，甚至连维克多那家伙都对他倾心，还有那个对明日香痴迷的绫波复制体。这里没有人想要杀他或追究他的责任……

Asuka's glare redirected to the floor. What did she want to hold him accountable for, lately? He had internalized her statement and responded accordingly, had set out to do whatever was in his hands to atone for actions that in retrospect, were not even fully his fault. Effortless as it was, the task of assigning blame to Shinji for the way the world had broken was superfluous and childish. The video footage Kensuke had provided was evidence enough.  
明日香的眼神重新转向地板。最近她想让他为哪些事负责呢？他已经将她的指责内化并做出了相应的回应，尽其所能去弥补那些事后看来并非完全是他过错的行为。将世界破碎的责任轻易归咎于真嗣，既多余又幼稚。光是健介提供的视频证据就已足够。

The sound of the cart wheels moving alerted Asuka. Hold him accountable for what? For trying to save someone he considered special, someone who had actively tried to improve Shinji's relationship with his father? For stepping into a behemoth he knew little about and caring not if his life disappeared in an effort to save someone? His inaction had cost her dearly, true, but Shinji had tried at first to rescue her, and when faced with the possibility of having to kill her, he chose to die himself before consciously harming her.  
车轮滚动的声响惊动了明日香。要他承担什么责任？为了试图拯救他视为特别的人，一个积极努力改善真嗣与父亲关系的人？为了踏入一个他知之甚少的庞然大物，不顾生命可能因此消逝，只为救人一命？他的不作为确实让她付出了沉重代价，确实如此，但真嗣起初曾试图救她，而当面临可能不得不杀她的境地时，他宁愿自己死去也不愿有意伤害她。

She had been someone important to him, regardless of how little time they had spent together.  
她曾是他生命中的重要人物，尽管他们相处的时间并不多。

Right after recovering some cognitive function, Shinji had gone out of his way to make tea and cook, he had even left her a meal after the disastrous attempt to force feed him a second time. He offered her lemonade and rations when the idiot was the one that was supposed to be eating more and taking better care of himself, and was now carrying logs to strangers for the fourth time.  
恢复意识后，真嗣特意去泡茶做饭，甚至在第二次强行喂食失败后还给她留了饭。当那个笨蛋本应多吃点、好好照顾自己时，他却给她提供了柠檬水和补给品，现在已经是第四次为陌生人扛木头了。

_Fine,_ relented the Major at last, for the first time in over fourteen years. _It's not his fault, not entirely. Not all of it, not when you consider everything he's been through. You knew long ago, you've always known. It's just easy to remain angry, it's much less painful to pretend to grow up. You keep saying you've changed, Asuka. How? Still blaming this brat for things that were out of his control, still pissed off, all for what? What are you doing?_  
好吧，少校终于让步了，这是十四年多来的第一次。这并非他的全部过错，并非完全如此。并非全部，当你考虑到他所经历的一切时。你很久以前就知道了，你一直都知道。保持愤怒很容易，假装成熟则痛苦少得多。你一直在说自己变了，明日香。怎么变的？还是在为这小子无法掌控的事情责怪他，依然愤怒，这一切又是为了什么？你在做什么？

Her eye narrowed at the pile of firewood. The temperature was already dropping and the silence stretched out even as insects and night birds sang away; surely whatever foolish work Kensuke had arranged for Shinji to do was already done. _What are you doing?_  
她眯起眼睛盯着那堆柴火。气温已经下降，尽管昆虫和夜鸟的鸣叫声此起彼伏，寂静依旧在蔓延；想必无论 Kensuke 安排给 Shinji 的愚蠢工作已经完成了。你在做什么？

The brat was sure to be invited to the Suzuhara household for dinner, and if not there was always the rations she had storaged in the car. After counting the minutes away and noticing how the sky was darkening, she huffed and headed back to the old train station.  
那小子肯定会被邀请到铃原家吃晚饭，如果不行，她车里还存有配给。她数着时间，注意到天色渐暗，便哼了一声，朝旧火车站走去。

She noticed the old jeep parked just outside the house; a glimpse through the window showed that the village leader was indeed sitting and eating with the family, Shinji, and the clone. From afar, the tiny fleck of bright white under the boy's track suit quieted the unease. The bandages had been changed and the wound cleaned. As the family ate, they joked around and smiled, laughed and collectively fumbled over the newborn. The Ayanami clone and Shinji spoke quietly to one another; the girl would address her curious gaze almost exclusively to him. She seemed at peace with her existence, however limited it would be.  
她注意到老吉普车就停在屋外；透过窗户，可以看到村长确实和家人、Shinji 以及复制体坐在一起吃饭。从远处看，男孩运动服下那一点微小的亮白色平息了她的不安。绷带已经更换，伤口也已清洁。一家人边吃边开玩笑，笑着，一起逗弄着新生儿。Ayanami 复制体和 Shinji 低声交谈；女孩几乎只向他投去好奇的目光。她似乎对自己的存在感到平静，尽管这种存在将是有限的。

A sudden emptiness consumed Asuka after staring a bit too long at the amiable scene.  
阿斯克凝视着这温馨场景片刻后，突然感到一阵空虚袭来。

Not too long after she arrived at the house, where she served herself a spoonful of water and collapsed on her bed, the run-down Suzuki made itself known and announced the arrival of the Third. Too many strange, unsettling thoughts and emotions were simmering in her head, so she decided to stay in bed and ignore the call for dinner.  
在她抵达那座房子不久后，自顾自舀了一勺水喝，便瘫倒在床上，那辆破旧的铃木车发出了声响，宣告第三者的到来。她脑海中充斥着太多奇异而不安的想法与情绪，于是决定赖在床上，无视晚餐的召唤。

Some agreement was made between the two males in the other room; she heard Kensuke mention at which hour he rose every day, along with which places he had to visit. The scent of soup being heated invaded her nostrils and made her stomach growl for the second time in years. Ignoring both the strange rumbling of her gut and the constant ache from her head, she closed her eye and pretended to sleep. At some point in the night she heard the brat enter the room and almost immediately turn back.  
隔壁房间里，两个男人达成了某种共识；她听见健介提到了他每天起床的时间，以及需要造访的地点。加热中的汤的香气侵入她的鼻腔，让她的肚子时隔多年再次发出咕噜声。她无视腹中异样的响动和持续的头痛，闭上眼假装入睡。夜深时分，她听到那小子进了房间，几乎立刻又转身离开。

_Damn brat, I could smell that bowl of soup from a mile away. What part of 'not hungry' did you not understand the last four times I said it?  
该死的小鬼，我隔着一英里都能闻到那碗汤的味道。我前四次说的“不饿”，你到底是哪部分没听懂？_

Once both males stopped moving and the light snoring of the village commander bounced off the walls, she stood and made her way to the car. Indeed, three of the rations had been cconsumed. Judging by the amount of crumbs decorating the passenger seat, Shinji had been the one to eat them. Nothing but an extra pair of clothes laying on the backseat and the three surviving rations remained inside the vehicle. With a satisfied nod, she tiptoed back to the room, not before realizing Shinji had woken up sometime during her time in the yard and was huddled in his blankets, reading some word from the dictionary with the earbuds firmly placed in his ears.  
当两名男性都停止了动作，村长的轻微鼾声在墙壁间回荡时，她站起身，悄悄走向汽车。确实，三份口粮已被消耗。从乘客座位上散落的碎屑来看，是真嗣吃掉了它们。车内只剩下一套多余的衣物和三份幸存的口粮。她满意地点点头，踮着脚尖回到房间，这才注意到真嗣在她外出期间已经醒来，正蜷缩在毯子里，耳朵里塞着耳机，从字典中读着某个词。

He did not turn to look at her; his eyes were fixed on the page, exhausted as they were.  
他没有回头看她；他的目光紧锁在书页上，疲惫不堪。

Asuka paused before entering the room and gazed at him. True, his skin was less pale and he was not sweating or shivering at every passing second, either. His eyes had been somewhat calm the night before, a bit less guarded and more alive than in the past few days. That night, she noticed his gaze was resolute and terrified all at once. With every passing day in the village, the magnitude of what the Impacts had brought about became clearer and sunk deeper into his mind.  
明日香在进房间前停顿了一下，凝视着他。确实，他的肤色不再那么苍白，也没有再每分每秒地出汗或颤抖。前一晚，他的眼神稍微平静了一些，不那么戒备，比前几天更有生气。那晚，她注意到他的目光既坚定又恐惧。随着在村子里的每一天过去，冲击带来的后果愈发清晰，深深烙印在他的脑海中。

_Idiot's certainly not gonna last,_ she realized whilst her eye drifted over to Shinji. _He went from not pushing at all, to pushing himself as hard as possible. It'll only be a matter of time before it backfires if he's not even sleeping._  
她一边想着，一边目光飘向了真嗣。他从一开始完全不努力，到现在拼尽全力。如果他连觉都不睡，迟早会适得其反。

The now familiar unease returned; she refused to admit it was concern.  
那熟悉的忐忑感再次袭来；她拒绝承认这是担忧。

---

_Twenty five logs per trips, four trips in total. Go to the houses, load the firewood in the sheds, carry the cart back and repeat. Make sure to bring extra firewood for Toji's house.  
每趟运送二十五根木柴，总共四趟。前往各家，将柴火装入棚内，运回推车并重复操作。务必为 Toji 家额外准备些木柴。_

The quiet whispers of the wind, critters and birds, and the clean air of the clearing became more familiar with each day. He did as he was told, worked on the main building distributing rations in the early morning after Kensuke dropped him off, handed the food and whatever he was able to concoct with the available ingredients to the crew working around the pillar, then walked over to Toji's house and dealt with the firewood delivery.  
风、小动物与鸟儿的轻声细语，以及林间空地的清新空气，随着每一天的流逝变得愈发熟悉。他按照吩咐行事，清晨在健介送他到达后，便在主建筑内分发口粮，将食物及利用现有食材所能调配的餐点递给围绕柱子工作的团队，随后步行至藤井家处理木柴的配送。

Cooking had been Asuka's idea the morning before, to both his and Kensuke's surprise.  
前一天早上，做饭的主意竟是出自明日香，这让真嗣和健司都感到意外。

"_The brat's always tinkering around the kitchen at night. Put those skills of his to some actual use. Morning crews rarely get anything other than protein bars, so have him make them some rice and fish or whatever you Lilim eat in the morning. There's always scraps in the kitchen areas, have him work with those or something."_  
那小子总在夜里厨房里捣鼓。让他把那些技能用在实处吧。早班人员除了蛋白棒几乎没什么别的，让他给他们做点米饭和鱼，或者你们莉莉姆早上吃的东西。厨房区总有剩菜剩饭，让他用那些或者别的什么做点东西。

She had actually sat down with them, if not at the table at least in its vicinity, and played with her Wonderswan as both he and Kensuke ate. The glares had been diminishing to an extent -or so he liked to believe- and the tremors had stopped altogether. Toji was mindful to change the bandages around his hand and clean the cut after every work session, but insisted Shinji had to keep the gauze on if he intended to continue working.  
她确实坐下来和他们一起，即使不在桌边至少也在附近，一边玩着她的 Wonderswan，一边看着他和健介吃饭。那种瞪视已经减少到一定程度了——或者他愿意这么相信——颤抖也完全停止了。真治小心地每次工作后更换手上的绷带并清洗伤口，但坚持让真嗣如果打算继续工作的话，就必须一直戴着纱布。

A familiar daze roamed all over him instead, akin to the fatigue his body had been assaulted with after spending five days with close to no sustenance or rest. His vision failed at times; everything turned blurry and distorted, the shapes were bathed in a strange crimson hue and he saw them again. No matter how tired he was, the image of living beings comprising the anatomy of the headless Wanderers refused to stop manifesting at every given chance. Whether he closed his eyes, memorized the meaning of a certain word to the tiniest detail or listened to the SDAT, the shapes moved and shifted within the body of those monsters.  
一股熟悉的恍惚感笼罩了他，宛如连续五天几乎未进食或休息后身体遭受的疲惫侵袭。他的视线时而失焦，一切变得模糊扭曲，形状被染上诡异的猩红色调，那些影像再次浮现。无论他多么疲惫，由无头漫游者构成的活体解剖图始终在每个可能的时刻显现。无论是闭上双眼，将某个词的意义铭记至细微末节，还是聆听 SDAT，那些形状都在这些怪物的体内游移变换。

He had seen Kensuke record them, had reviewed the tape with him and discovered no bizarre motions in the creature's exterior. It was all a figment of his exhausted imagination; the sleepless nights had surely damaged or affected something. Nobody else even mentioned such movements from within the Wanderers.  
他曾目睹健介将它们录下，与他一同回看录像，并未发现那生物外表有何怪异动作。这一切不过是疲惫想象中的虚构；那些不眠之夜无疑已损伤或影响了某些方面。其他人甚至未曾提及流浪者内部的此类动作。

Sleep had become a strange commodity in the past three days. Ever since first laying eyes on the appalling giants, it had become increasingly harder to shut off his mind and stop remembering every little decision and detail that had led him to sleeping on the wooden floor of Kensuke's home. Instead of trying to comprehend the visions, Shinji simply carried on with whatever task was given to him and devoted every bit of energy to it. He nodded off from exhaustion every night for a few hours, but never too deeply or too long for the rest to be in any way restorative.  
过去三天里，睡眠成了一种奇异的奢侈品。自从初次目睹那些骇人的巨人以来，他的思绪愈发难以平息，无法停止回忆起每一个将他引至在 Kensuke 家木地板上入睡的决定和细节。Shinji 没有试图去理解那些幻象，只是继续完成手头的任务，将每一分精力都投入其中。每晚他都因疲惫而打盹几个小时，但从未睡得过深或过久，以至于无法得到任何恢复。

Whenever the horrid spectacle of Kaworu or the choker on Asuka's neck did not shake him awake, the Wanderers ensured he woke up drenched in a cold sweat.  
每当卡沃鲁那令人厌恶的身影或明日香颈上的项圈未能将他惊醒时，流浪者们总能确保他一身冷汗地醒来。

"Ryoji said... the curry was good yesterday," he murmured in between gasps. His legs were starting to shake; this made the third day carrying firewood. Three nights without proper rest and barely enough food to keep him functioning. "Wonder if Asuka ate the lunch… I left in the kitchen."  
"Ryoji 说...昨天的咖喱很好吃，"他喘息间喃喃道。双腿开始颤抖；这是第三天扛柴了。连续三晚没有好好休息，食物也仅够维持基本运作。"不知道 Asuka 有没有吃掉我留在厨房的午餐。"

The path blurred for a few seconds. Shinji stopped, yawned into a blistered hand and rubbed at his eyes, seizing the small break to reach for the bottle the stranger had gifted him that morning. _Orange juice instead of lemonade today. Can't forget to pick up the oranges he gave me this morning, either. Might be able to cook that rabbit Kensuke caught after all._  
小径在几秒钟内变得模糊不清。真嗣停下脚步，打着哈欠用起了水泡的手揉了揉眼睛，趁这短暂的间隙伸手去拿今早那位陌生人送给他的瓶子。今天换成了橙汁而不是柠檬水。也不能忘了去取他早上给我的那些橙子。或许终究能用健介抓到的那只兔子做顿饭。

His breath was ragged, every few minutes Shinji felt his body grow stiff despite the movement. It was getting harder to walk, harder still to think or respond. Toji's neighbors had already asked if he was feeling alright the day before. Hikari's gaze had also been growing increasingly concerned as hours rolled by and his visage worsened. After emptying the bottle and taking a few shallow breaths, he carried on.  
他的呼吸粗重，每隔几分钟，尽管身体在移动，真嗣仍感到自己变得僵硬。走路越来越困难，思考或回应也愈发艰难。昨天，东治的邻居们已经询问他是否感觉良好。随着时间的推移，光的眼神也变得越来越担忧，他的脸色每况愈下。喝完瓶中的液体并深吸几口气后，他继续前行。

_It's fine. Today is the last day, anyways. Mr. Bunzaemon said one more delivery will see them well over the month with firewood. One more trip and you're done.  
没事的。反正今天是最后一天了。文左卫门先生说再送一次柴火，他们就能撑过这个月。再跑一趟，你就完成了。_

Along with the fresh air and physical exertion, the time spent alone in the small forest had worked wonders. Even as the image of the giants outside pursued his afterthoughts and dreams, reality was more palpable. People gave him ample space to heal; they were considerate and gentle and not once scowled in displeasure when he arrived. The girl with Rei's face but different eyes inquired about his pathetic efforts at work and smiled. Tsubame was beginning to recognize him, or so he liked to believe.  
伴随着清新的空气和身体的锻炼，独自在小树林中度过的时光产生了奇妙的效果。尽管巨人外形的影像仍追逐着他的思绪和梦境，现实却变得更加真切。人们给予他充足的空间疗愈；他们体贴而温柔，从未在他到来时露出不满的神情。那位有着丽面孔却眼神迥异的女孩询问他工作上的可怜努力，并报以微笑。燕子开始认出他了，至少他是这么希望的。

Shinji tripped and almost fell to the ground. The cart felt unreasonably heavy that day, and the floor was muddy and slippery after the night's rainfall. Hikari's father had also mentioned it was likely to drizzle in the afternoon, so haste was necessary to avoid getting either himself or the logs soaked.  
真嗣绊了一跤，差点摔倒在地。那天手推车感觉异常沉重，而且经过昨晚的降雨，地面泥泞湿滑。光里的父亲还提到下午可能会下小雨，因此必须加快速度，以免自己和木材被淋湿。

He tried to hurry as best as he could. The last conversation with Kensuke regarding Ryoji's parentage weighed heavy on his mind; it felt strange to know such a sensitive detail that had apparently been kept secret from the boy himself. Misato had opted for complete anonymity and erasure of all ties in an effort to protect her child. She fought tirelessly against Shinji's father and had been forced to relinquish her own family to do so, it was no wonder she had been so different to him. On top of having cost Asuka her humanity, her eye and who knew what else, on top of breaking the world like an egg, he had estranged the WILLE Captain from her child.  
他竭尽全力加快脚步。与健介关于亮司身世的最后一次对话沉重地压在他的心头；得知这样一个显然对男孩本人保密的关键细节，感觉颇为怪异。美里选择了彻底的匿名和切断所有联系，以保护她的孩子。她不懈地与真嗣的父亲抗争，为此不得不放弃自己的家庭，难怪她对他如此不同。除了让明日香失去了人性、一只眼睛，以及其他未知的一切，除了像打碎鸡蛋一样毁掉世界，他还让 WILLE 的舰长与她的孩子疏远了。

The moment the last house came into view, thunder rumbled in the distance.  
当最后一座房屋映入眼帘时，远处传来了隆隆的雷声。

"Oh, Ikari! Thank you for the firewood, young man! Timely as always!" The burly man who had greeted him days before smiled placidly after opening the door. Despite the exhaustion, Shinji managed to smile back for the first time in three days of meeting him.  
“哦，碇！谢谢你送来的木柴，小伙子！一如既往地及时！”几天前迎接他的那位魁梧男子在开门后平静地笑着。尽管疲惫，碇真嗣还是设法回以三天来第一次的微笑。

"Uhm, it's no problem really," Shinji answered while carrying the logs onto a pile next to the door. "I'm happy to help."  
“呃，真的没什么，”碇真嗣一边回答，一边将木柴搬到门旁的一堆上。“我很乐意帮忙。”

"Well, you've helped plenty these days." The man chuckled and shook his head. "Still don't want to try your luck with the forge? A helping hand is always welcome!"  
“嗯，这些天你已经帮了不少忙了。”男子笑着摇了摇头。“还是不想试试打铁吗？帮手总是受欢迎的！”

"I don't think I'll be of much help," panted the boy in between trips. He was finally doing something and not hurting anybody along the way, getting burned or causing an injury in the man's work station still felt too possible to risk. "I'll just get in the way."  
“我觉得我帮不上什么忙，”男孩喘着气，在来回奔波间说道。他终于在做些事情，而且没有伤害任何人，但在那人的工作站里被烧伤或造成伤害的风险依然太大，他不想冒险。“我只会碍事。”

"No you won't, but it's fine. Think about it, though! It's good work, and I'll add a couple of fish as payment. Heard you're helping in the ration station in the mornings, so I'll get off your hair for the time being."  
“不，你不会的，但没关系。不过，想想吧！这是份好工作，我会额外加几条鱼作为报酬。听说你早上在配给站帮忙，所以暂时不打扰你了。”

The last pieces of wood were carried off, yet before he could start walking away the man's heavy hand fell on his shoulder. "I really appreciate your help these past few days. You should get some rest, kid. You're looking a little tired."  
最后几块木头被搬走了，然而在他能开始离开之前，那人的沉重手掌落在了他的肩膀上。“我真的很感激你这几天的帮助。你应该休息一下，孩子。你看起来有点累了。”

"Right." Shinji nodded and offered a second smile, one he hoped did not feel too forced. He bowed and started walking away. "I'll be sure to do that. Thank you for the food yesterday."  
“好的。” 真嗣点点头，又露出了一个微笑，希望这个笑容看起来不要太勉强。他鞠了一躬，开始走开。“我一定会的。谢谢你昨天的食物。”

"It's a pleasure. Hey, kid. Take good care of yourself, alright?" Koga watched the boy leave and spared a few glances around the housing district, surprised to see no flashes of gold-crimson or green anywhere. "Hmm, weird. Thought she'd be tagging along today, too. If she ain't around I better call Toji, something doesn't feel right."  
"很高兴见到你。嘿，孩子。好好照顾自己，好吗？" 犬夜叉看着男孩离开，环顾了一下住宅区，惊讶地没有看到任何金红色或绿色的闪光。"嗯，奇怪。我还以为她今天也会跟着来。如果她不在，我最好给冬二打个电话，总觉得哪里不对劲。"

With little more than a half-gasped affirmation, Shinji set off back to Toji's house with the cart in toll; the tool felt heavier somehow even though it was empty. By the time he reached around the clearing, his arms and leg were trembling with strain and his vision swam every few minutes. Another yawn erupted from his chest. He stopped just right outside the clearing, where two young men a bit older than him each carried a cart filled to the brim with firewood while they joked with one another.  
仅以半声喘息的肯定回应，真嗣便带着手推车返回冬二的房子；那工具不知为何感觉更重了，尽管它是空的。当他走到空地附近时，他的手臂和腿因用力而颤抖，视线每隔几分钟就模糊一次。他又打了个哈欠。他停在空地外，那里有两个比他稍大的年轻人，各自推着满满一车木柴，边开玩笑边走。

Had Shinji been in a bit less weary condition, he could have hidden somewhere in the bushes, ignored them altogether or managed a hesitant greeting and then leave in a hurry. The overtiredness slowed his reaction time just enough for the two youngsters to spot him and wave, and once he responded with half a greeting, the teens began walking in his direction. His pulse quickened; tired as he was the idea of interacting with others was displeasing.  
如果真嗣的状态稍微好一些，他本可以躲在灌木丛中，完全无视他们，或是勉强打个招呼然后匆匆离开。过度疲劳恰好减缓了他的反应速度，使得两个年轻人发现了他并挥手示意，而他半心半意的回应后，那两位少年便朝他走来。他的心跳加速了；尽管疲惫不堪，与他人互动的想法仍令他感到不快。

"Hey, you're that kid!" the smaller one mentioned with a smirk. "You know, Kota, the one who's been helping Mr. Horaki these past few days."  
"嘿，你就是那个孩子！" 较矮的那个带着一丝戏谑说道，"记得吗，Kota，就是这几天一直在帮堀木先生忙的那个。"

"Right! I've seen you move around some. Taking care of the old bat's routes, are you?" The larger one pointed at his cart, then back to the path which led to the village center. "Word around the houses is that you're trying to help a little, right? Say, wouldn't you mind giving us a hand?"  
"没错！我见过你四处走动。是在打理那老妖婆的路线吧，对不对？" 大个子指了指他的推车，又指向通往村中心的路上。"大家都在传，说你想帮点忙，是吧？嘿，你不介意搭把手吧？"

"Hey, hey, it's supposed to be our job. Come on, Kota, we just came to say hi and stuff," the boy called Kota was smacked not too kindly in the arm. "Stop being a lazy leech. Let's go."  
“嘿，嘿，这本来就是我们的活儿。来吧，Kota，我们只是来打个招呼什么的。”那个叫 Kota 的男孩被不太客气地拍了一下胳膊。“别偷懒了，走吧。”

"No, no, Satoshi. Listen, the guy wants to help in every way he can! I heard Ryoji mentioning something like that the other day after the ball game. Say… Shinji, was it?" Kota neared Shinji and motioned to both carts.  
“不，不，聪志。听着，那家伙想尽他所能地帮忙！我记得那天球赛后亮司提过类似的事。对了……是真嗣，对吧？” 航太靠近真嗣，示意两辆推车。

"Listen, man. We've been moving this stupid firewood all around, all over to the bathhouse so the rice workers can chill for a while. They need lots of fuel on rainy days like this, though." The boy placed a hand on his shoulder that almost made Shinji flinch. "Why don't you help us out a little today, huh? Take care of this for us, and we take Mr. Horaki's cart back. How's that sound?"  
“听着，伙计。我们一直在把这堆蠢木头搬来搬去，全搬到澡堂那边，好让种稻的工人们能歇会儿。像今天这样的雨天，他们需要很多柴火。”男孩把手搭在他肩上，差点让真嗣吓一跳。“今天不如帮我们一把，怎么样？帮我们处理这些木头，我们就把洞木先生的推车还回去。听起来如何？”

_I'm really tired,_ he thought dispassionately. Not only was he feeling weak, he had not eaten anything since breakfast, and the clouds were shifting from gray to black; it would rain soon. _I shouldn't do any more trips. Asuka told me to take better care of myself. I should go back to Toj-_  
我真的累了，他冷静地想。不仅感到虚弱，自从早餐后他什么也没吃，而且云层正从灰色转为黑色；很快就要下雨了。我不该再跑这一趟了。明日香告诉我要好好照顾自己。我应该回东治——

"I hear that Miss Lookalike goes to the bathhouse fairly regularly," Satoshi mentioned, and scratched at his arm in apparent discomfort. "I'm sure she'd appreciate the firewood. Let's go, Koga. Time to get back to w-"  
“我听说那位长得像的女士经常去澡堂，”聪史提到，明显不安地挠了挠手臂。“我相信她会感激这些柴火的。走吧，古贺。是时候回——”

"Is this the train carriage close to the distribution center?" Shinji asked. Both youngsters quieted and exchanged glances before nodding. "Oh, I know the one." He walked over to the largest cart. "It's no problem. I'll try to help the best I can. Please be sure to tell Mr. Bunzaemon that I'll be there soon."  
“这是靠近配送中心的火车车厢吗？”真治问道。两个年轻人安静下来，交换了一下眼神，然后点头。“哦，我知道那个。”他走向最大的手推车。“没问题。我会尽力帮忙。请务必告诉文左卫门先生，我很快就会到。”

"Hey, there's no need to do that," the smaller one interceded and tried to stop him. "Besides, you look really tired. This is our route so don't worry about it, okay?"  
“嘿，没必要这么做，”较矮的那个插话道，试图阻止他。“再说，你看起来真的很累。这是我们的路线，所以别担心，好吗？”

He had been evading the visions of any Wanderers throughout the day, and just when the boy placed a hand on his arm the sight of one bled through his mind's eye. It was still nowhere near enough, he was doing too little. His efforts were still so insignificant that exhaustion was keeping him from providing that girl his father had raised as a slave from more normality and pleasant experiences.  
他一整天都在躲避任何流浪者的幻象，就在男孩将手放在他手臂上的那一刻，一个幻象透过他的心灵之眼渗入。这仍然远远不够，他做得太少了。他的努力依然如此微不足道，以至于疲惫让他无法给予那个被父亲当作奴隶抚养的女孩更多正常与愉快的体验。

"I can do it, it's fine." Before the other boy could further protest, Shinji hoisted the handles of the cart and forced his tired muscles to work overtime. The cart was both larger and heavier, plus it was almost twice the distance from his former route. There were two trips to make.  
“我能行，没问题的。”在另一个男孩进一步抗议之前，真嗣扛起手推车的把手，强迫自己疲惫的肌肉超负荷工作。这辆车不仅更大更重，而且距离他之前的路线几乎有两倍远。需要跑两趟。

"Hey, Ikari kid! Come on, you don't need to do th-ooof."  
“嘿，碇家的孩子！来吧，你不需要做这个——呃。”

Kota elbowed his friend on the side again for good measure and waved with enthusiasm at the Third Child. "Thank you so much, friend! You're a real life saver!" He turned to the whimpering Satoshi. "Dude_, shut up_! Do you want to get soaked to the bone like yesterday? Let's get this back to the Suzuharas and go home! Extra chicken soup for us!"  
小太再次用胳膊肘捅了捅他的朋友，以示强调，然后热情地向第三适格者挥手。“非常感谢你，朋友！你真是救星啊！”他转向呜咽的智。“伙计，闭嘴！你想像昨天那样浑身湿透吗？我们把这个送回铃原家，然后回家！我们还能多喝点鸡汤！”

"You're such a lazy bastard sometimes." The smaller boy got to his feet and dusted his pants, taking hold of Toji's cart and hurrying towards the house. "Didn't you see how tired that guy looked?"  
“你有时候真是懒得要命。”较小的男孩站起身，拍了拍裤子上的灰尘，抓住了东治的推车，急忙向房子走去。“你没看到那家伙看起来有多累吗？”

"Ah, he'll be fine. You're worrying too much. Besides, now we have an extra hour off to chill out! You know Viko ain't looking at his orange trees at this hour! Let's go get some!"  
“啊，他会没事的。你担心过头了。再说了，现在我们多了一个小时的休息时间可以放松！你知道维科这时候不会去看他的橙子树的！我们去摘点吧！”

The voices faded into the distance after a few steps. Shinji chuckled, it was not as though the so-called Viko was particularly protective of the fruits. If anything, the man was happy to gift each and every one to the villagers. There was a healthy bag of oranges waiting for him in Toji's house as evidence of the man's seeming generosity.  
几步之后，声音便消散在远处。真嗣轻笑一声，所谓的维克并非特别珍视这些果实。相反，那人似乎乐于将每一颗都慷慨赠予村民。作为其慷慨之证，东治家里还为他备了一袋新鲜的橙子。

"Just two of these… trips…" Regardless of the new route length, what would have normally bothered Shinji was walking in the middle of the village by himself. Nonetheless the exhaustion was such that he barely registered when the wagons and houses started surrounding him. "Almost there, turn a right here, two blocks and then to the right. Leave the firewood… by the door… get the second cart… no problem…"  
"就这两趟……行程……" 不论新路程的长短，平时让真嗣困扰的，是自己独自走在村子中央。然而此刻疲惫至极，以至于他几乎没注意到马车和房屋开始环绕在他周围。"快到了，这里右转，过两个街区再右转。把柴火……放在门口……去拉第二辆车……没问题……"

Sweat dripped off his skin with each step. The extra weight of the cart and the muddy surface only made the task harder, yet he stubbornly moved forward. If bringing the firewood meant Rei could have a comfortable bath after a hard day's work, then fatigue was nothing but a tiny setback.  
汗水随着每一步从他皮肤上滴落。手推车的额外重量和泥泞的地面让任务更加艰难，但他固执地向前移动。如果运送柴火意味着丽可以在辛苦工作一天后洗个舒服的热水澡，那么疲劳不过是小小的挫折。

_Kensuke has more than enough firewood in his house,_ he mused while walking. _I guess I could help out by chopping the logs. That way I can cook more often. Maybe then I can ask her about the food, but I still don't get it. Is that going to happen to me, too? Am I going to stop needing food? Is that curse of Eva already doing something to me?_  
健介家里储存的柴火已经绰绰有余了，他边走边想。或许我可以帮忙劈些木头，这样就能更频繁地做饭了。也许那时我可以向她请教关于食物的事情，但我还是不太明白。这种事也会发生在我身上吗？我会不再需要进食吗？那个《EVA》的诅咒已经开始影响我了吗？

Shinji reached the wagon and left the firewood in a haste, suddenly embarrassed at the thought of disturbing the ladies during their bath, and left as abruptly as he arrived. It was only after the slight shot of adrenaline wore off that the tiredness settled once more, this time sinking into his very bones. Sleepless nights and hard days were forcibly making themselves known as he climbed up the last hill and retrieved the second cart.  
真嗣匆匆赶到马车旁，急忙放下柴火，突然因为想到打扰女士们洗澡而感到尴尬，便如他来时那般突然离开了。直到那一阵轻微的肾上腺素激增消退后，疲惫感再次袭来，这次深深地渗入了他的骨髓。无眠的夜晚和艰苦的日子在他攀上最后一座小山，取回第二辆马车时，毫不留情地向他宣告了它们的存在。

Rain began to fall down with a final, brutal thunderclap that cut through the relative silence, and just as its echo disappeared, a curtain of heavy rain covered everything in his vicinity. "Might as well finish up the work…" Speaking was becoming difficult. A growing headache added itself to the list of discomforts running through him. "The cart is well covered… should be fine."  
雨终于伴随着一声穿透相对寂静的猛烈雷鸣倾盆而下，就在回声消逝之际，一道厚重的雨幕笼罩了他周围的一切。“还是把活干完吧……”说话变得困难起来。愈发剧烈的头痛又增添了一份不适。“车子盖得严实……应该没事。”

Shinji's shirt and pants were soaked in seconds. The water was chilly, mercilessly sending new shivers down his formerly sweaty body. He ignored the growing dizziness and set to the path. It was only a few hundred meters, after all. How difficult could it possibly be to finish this little task? The Wanderers were most certainly undeterred by rain, so was his father, and so were the villagers.  
碇真嗣的衬衫和裤子在几秒钟内就被浸透了。冰冷的水无情地在他原本汗湿的身体上引发新的颤抖。他无视逐渐加剧的眩晕，踏上了那条路。毕竟只有几百米远。完成这个小任务又能有多难呢？流浪者们绝不会被雨水吓倒，他的父亲如此，村民们亦然。

_Asuka told me not to be stupid today._ Wild gusts of wind sent the rain straight into his eyes and made the road that much harder to maneuver. The road was almost overflowing with mud and easily went through the boots Hikari had let him borrow; the tracksuit was also waiting for him at their living room, which only left the worn-down pants he used for work as defense against the harsh weather.  
明日香今天告诉我别犯傻。狂风骤雨直扑他的双眼，让道路变得更加难以驾驭。路面几乎被泥浆淹没，轻易地浸透了光莉借给他的靴子；他们的客厅里还放着那套运动服，而他只能靠那条破旧的工作裤来抵御恶劣天气。

_Good thing this cart's got some decent tires, they're not getting stuck in the mud at all. I can almost see the wagons already. Almost done, just a final delivery and then I can try cooking that rabbit with an orange sauce. I'm sure she'll like it, she liked that orange duck I made for a bento that day at school. Just one last trip and then I'll cook that rabbit. I bet she'll like it.  
幸好这辆推车装了些像样的轮胎，一点儿也没陷进泥里。我几乎已经能看到那些马车了。快完成了，就差最后一趟送货，然后我就可以尝试用橙汁烧那只兔子了。她肯定会喜欢的，她那天在学校吃便当时就喜欢我做的橙香鸭肉。就再跑一趟，然后我就做那只兔子。我敢说她会喜欢的。_

As soon as he reached the bathhouse, he set about putting the wood in its place without the logs getting overly wet. It had been a bad idea to reject Bunzaemon's offer of an umbrella; before he was done every inch of his body was dripping wet. The downpour was so heavy he doubted anyone in the bathhouse realized he was outside. Carrying the last three logs proved excruciatingly difficult, the world faded twice instead of blurring, and he had to support himself on the wagon so as not to fall flat on the ground.  
一抵达澡堂，他便开始将木头安置到位，尽量避免让木头过于湿透。拒绝文左卫门的伞是个糟糕的决定；还没干完活，他全身已湿透。暴雨如注，他怀疑澡堂里是否有人意识到他还在外面。搬运最后三根木头异常艰难，视线两次完全模糊，他不得不扶着马车以免摔倒在地。

The cart felt impossible to move when he next tried to push it. The wheels which had so dutifully refused to stick to the mud now worked against him, the rain froze his skin and his vision swam again. All he needed to do was take the cart back to the clearing and return to Toji's house. In between the icy rain and the headache, Shinji only took about twenty steps away from the bathhouse before his legs failed him.  
当他再次尝试推动手推车时，感觉它重得无法移动。那些曾如此忠实地拒绝陷入泥泞的车轮现在却与他作对，雨水冻僵了他的皮肤，视线也再次模糊起来。他只需将手推车推回空地，然后返回 Toji 的家。在冰冷的雨和头痛之间，Shinji 离开澡堂不过走了约二十步，双腿便支撑不住了。

Everything went black, not unlike the first time he had climbed into Unit 01 and gotten a spear through his skull. The headache also reached a similar crescendo to that occasion; he felt a giant needle press into his eyes and extend all the way to his forehead. Shinji stumbled after dropping the cart a second time; he tried to take in deep breaths and focus his vision on something close like the next wagon, to no avail. The nausea morphed into overwhelming weakness, his chest rebelled and stop taking in air, and his eyes rolled to the back of his head.  
一切陷入黑暗，与他初次爬进初号机并被长矛贯穿头颅时的情景如出一辙。剧痛也达到了相似的顶峰；他感觉仿佛有根巨大的针刺入双眼，一直延伸至前额。真嗣在第二次摔落推车后踉跄着；他试图深呼吸并集中视线于近处的下一辆车，却徒劳无功。恶心感转化为难以抵挡的虚弱，他的胸口抗拒着呼吸，双眼翻向脑后。

Shinji slid down the metal surface and into the ground, barely able to ensure he collapsed into a somewhat seated position before the shape of the train carriages went dark. The freezing cold of the rain, the visage of the Wanderers, the fatigue, his desire to finally ask Hikari what the nature of Asuka's relationship with Kensuke was; everything disappeared.  
真嗣顺着金属表面滑落到地面，勉强在列车车厢陷入黑暗之前确保自己瘫坐下来。冰冷的雨水、流浪者的面容、疲惫，以及他终于想问光关于明日香和健介关系的本质；一切都消失了。

The last thought before the world dissolved into shadows was that he still had not received permission and therefore could not possibly die. This was but a small power nap, he would rest his eyes for a few minutes, just a little while.  
在世间消融于阴影前的最后一念，是他仍未获准许，因此绝不可能就此死去。这不过是一次短暂的打盹，他只需闭目养神几分钟，稍作歇息。

_It's just a little nap. Just a little… nap…  
只是小憩一会儿。就一会儿……小憩……_

Half an hour later Rei spotted something strange on her way back. A large cart laying amidst the path arose her curiosity at first, and the heavy footsteps in the mud led her to Shinji's prone form, half covered in mud already, breathing shallowly and continuously shaking under the rain. At a loss of what to do, she altered the other rice workers and together, they hoisted the unconscious Third Child and got him into the warmth of the wagon. Rei was asked to alert Hikari and Toji of the boy's situation, but in a strange, impulsive act of rebelliousness, she chose to stay by his side and have someone else inform the Suzuharas.  
半小时后，丽在返回途中发现了一些奇怪的东西。一辆大车横在路中间，首先引起了她的好奇，而泥泞中的沉重脚步声则引导她找到了真嗣，他半身已被泥浆覆盖，呼吸浅而急促，在雨中不停地颤抖。不知所措的她改变了其他稻田工人的路线，大家一起将失去意识的第三适格者抬上了温暖的马车。丽被要求通知光和剑介关于男孩的情况，但在一种奇怪的、冲动的反叛行为中，她选择留在他身边，让别人去通知铃原一家。

It was not until she was reassured that Shinji was in no immediate danger, and after seeing him come to as they helped him into the warm bath, that she felt the rock constricting her breathing be lifted from her chest. Some time passed; she was unaware how long, focused on the boy's skin color and how it went back to normal. At some point the man with the glasses arrived to take him away, looking concerned and more than a bit disheveled. The downpour continued well into the night, only worsening as hours went by.  
直到她确信真嗣没有立即危险，并在看到他随着他们将他扶进温暖的浴缸而苏醒后，她才感到那块压迫她呼吸的巨石从胸口移开。时间流逝，她不知过了多久，全神贯注于男孩的肤色如何恢复正常。某刻，那位戴眼镜的男子到来，神情关切且略显凌乱地接走了他。暴雨持续至深夜，随着时间推移愈发猛烈。

It might have been a trick of her mind, but for a second she saw the shadow of the Second Child disappear behind the passenger door.  
或许是她一时的错觉，但有那么一瞬，她瞥见二号机的影子消失在乘客车门后。

---

Something was amiss. 有些不对劲。

The idiot normally arrived just after sundown, choosing to use her path to avoid been seen by people on his way back to the house. For the past three days the routine had been solid enough; after being shown the trail by Toji after the second day's work, the entire trip had gained a full extra fifteen minutes.  
那个白痴通常在日落后不久到达，选择走她的路以避免在回屋的路上被人看见。过去三天里，这个规律已经相当固定；在第二天工作后由东治带他走过这条小径，整个行程增加了整整十五分钟。

One hour; Shinji was already late by more than one hour. It had begun to rain quite heavily some minutes before, making Asuka's brow furrow in more displeasure. Perhaps the brat had been caught unawares by the rain and was waiting it out somewhere; the most likely scenario was that the day's work had been cleared earlier than before, and he simply was with Hikari's family, eating and exchanging lovingly shy glances with the Ayanami clone.  
一小时了；真嗣已经迟到超过一小时。几分钟前开始下起了大雨，这让明日香的眉头更加紧皱，满是不悦。或许那小子被突如其来的雨困住了，正躲在某处等雨停；最有可能的情况是，今天的工作比以往提前结束，他现在正和光一家在一起，边吃边与那个绫波克隆人交换着羞涩而深情的目光。

Having observed Shinji for days now, the signs of some level of improvement were impossible to miss. He responded to speech concisely and understood what was said to him, instead of nodding robotically and performing whatever command was given. His movements had been getting lethargic, however. If her nightly visits to 'get water' had proven anything, it was that Shinji slept three to four hours a day at best, and spent the rest of the night reading, translating or simply listening to music.  
经过多日的观察，真嗣有所改善的迹象显而易见。他现在能简洁地回应言语，并理解所说的话，不再机械地点头执行任何指令。然而，他的动作却日渐迟缓。从她每晚借口“取水”的探访中可以证实，真嗣每天最多只睡三到四个小时，其余时间都在阅读、翻译或单纯地听音乐。

Shinji would rise out of bed nearly at the same time as Kensuke, cook whatever was available, prepare a bento to be left on the table every single day, and left to work in the village during the morning. The boy's change in attitude was not strange nor unexpected; he was doing everything possible to work and not think, trying to make a tiny difference however possible.  
真嗣几乎与健介同时起床，烹饪现有的食材，每天准备便当放在桌上，然后早晨便去村子里工作。男孩态度的转变既不奇怪也不出人意料；他尽一切可能努力工作，不去思考，试图以任何可能的方式做出微小的改变。

_And he's freaking neglecting his health again, the idiot. Eating less, not sleeping. I told Kenken letting the brat see the Wanderers wasn't a great idea. It was just a matter of time though.  
他又在糟蹋自己的健康了，这个傻瓜。吃得少，睡得少。我告诉过健健，让那小子去看流浪者可不是什么好主意。不过，这迟早会发生的事。_

The Wonderswan game ran at its fastest speed, yet the thoughts would not fade despite Asuka's best efforts to focus all her attention on it.  
神奇天鹅游戏以最快的速度运行，然而尽管明日香竭尽全力将所有注意力集中在游戏上，那些思绪却依旧挥之不去。

_I should've… should've what? Kept tabs on him today, as well?_ She glared at the handheld and relented. The device was left by the bed, as it had been for the past few days as well. _I knew something was going to happen today. There was something different in the way he was talking. Sluggish, almost drunk. Too many sleepiness nights right after getting cured of an infection. Idiot brat, here I am thinking he'll actually grow up some, and then this crap happens._  
我本该……本该怎样？今天也一直盯着他吗？她瞪着掌中的设备，最终还是妥协了。那装置一如过去几天那样，被留在了床边。我知道今天会有事发生。他的说话方式有些异样，迟缓，近乎醉意。刚从感染中痊愈就接连熬了太多夜。这傻小子，我还以为他真能成熟些，结果却出了这种事。

Nothing but the nasty storm going outside could be heard in the house. He was already late by more than an hour and a half. Asuka rose from bed and put on her plugsuit in a rush, then grabbed both the military jacked and the one she had given Shinji. "Where are you going?" she hissed to herself, pacing through the small living room. "What are you doing? You're gonna risk being seen again, gonna get soaked to the bone just because your prisoner's being a childish idiot? What? What are you going to do?"  
屋内只能听见外面恶劣的风暴声。他已经迟到了一个半小时。明日香匆忙从床上起身，迅速穿上插入栓服，抓起军用夹克和她送给真嗣的那件。“你要去哪儿？”她自言自语地嘀咕着，在小客厅里踱步。“你在做什么？又要冒险被人发现，又要淋得浑身湿透，就因为你的囚犯是个幼稚的白痴？你要干什么？你要怎么做？”

She sat back on a chair and tried to keep her eye away from both the SDAT and the dictionary. The day before, curiosity had finally won over and the last three tracks had bounced off her ears. He had thanked her again that same morning; an extra set of batteries 'magically' appeared on his blankets after he showered.  
她靠坐在椅子上，努力不去看 SDAT 和字典。前一天，好奇心终究占了上风，最后三首曲子在她耳边回荡。那天早上他又向她道谢；他洗完澡后，毯子上“神奇”地多出了一对电池。

Her emotions had shifted from wrath to apathy, and now the strange unease came more frequently than ever before. Some unspoken magnetism forced her legs forward every afternoon and led her to the clearing where the firewood was stored and collected. It felt strangely gratifying to see the idiot try his hardest. It was endearing to a degree, seeing him smile uncomfortably when Toji's neighbors thanked him or invited him over for meals.  
她的情绪从愤怒转为冷漠，如今那种莫名的不安比以往任何时候都更频繁地袭来。某种无形的磁力每天下午驱使着她的双腿，引领她走向柴火堆放和收集的空地。看到那个傻瓜竭尽全力，感觉异常满足。看到他在邻居们感谢他或邀请他共进餐时尴尬地微笑，这让人感到某种程度的可爱。

The unease boiled and spread all over her chest. _Something's wrong._  
不安在她胸中翻涌蔓延。有什么不对劲。

The moment she rose from the chair the sound of a car's brakes halting outside drew Asuka's attention to the door. Kensuke burst in, drenched and eyes frantic, then dashed straight to where Shinji slept and yanked a blanked away.  
她刚从椅子上站起来，一辆车在门外急刹的声音就吸引了明日香的注意。剑介冲了进来，浑身湿透，眼神狂乱，直奔到真嗣睡觉的地方，猛地扯开了一条毯子。

"Shinji collapsed in the village," he answered before she could ask the question. "He was delivering firewood to the bathhouse, some guys convinced him to take their delivery routes and he got caught up in the rain. I talked to Toji, he says he'll be fine, he's just exhausted and needs rest. Damn guy, told him to take it easy and he overworks himself into exhaustion. Shikinami, have you seen the j-"  
“真嗣在村子里晕倒了，”她还没来得及问，他就回答了。“他在给澡堂送柴火，有几个家伙说服他接了他们的送货路线，结果被雨困住了。我跟东治谈过，他说真嗣没事，只是太累了需要休息。该死的，我告诉他要轻松点，他却把自己累到虚脱。式波，你看到那把——”

"I've got the damn jacket. Get the car going, I'll pick up the other towel. Perfect, like a little hypothermia isn't just what I needed." The red garment was held angrily in Asuka's grip. After a second's hesitation, she picked up the hat as well. "Gotta keep the brat's head warm or his weak little body will get sick all over again."  
"我拿到了那该死的外套。发动车子，我去拿另一条毛巾。完美，就像轻微的失温症正是我需要的。" 明日香愤怒地抓着那件红色外套。犹豫了一瞬后，她还是拿起了帽子。"得给那小鬼的头保暖，不然他那虚弱的身体又要生病了。"

"I'll be back in a few." Kensuke darted off to the car, but stopped in his tracks when he saw Asuka exit the house before him. "Wait, what are you doing? He's being held in the village right now, practically in the middle of it."  
“我一会儿就回来。”健介冲向车子，却在看到明日香先他一步走出房子时停下了脚步。“等等，你在干什么？他现在被关在村子里，几乎就在中心地带。”

"So what? He's _my_ prisoner. Hurry the hell up! It's raining!" Asuka offered no further explanation and headed for the vehicle.  
“那又怎样？他是我的俘虏。快点！下雨了！”明日香没有进一步解释，径直朝车子走去。

"Don't you think that's a bad idea? I mean, you know what the vill-"  
"你不觉得这是个馊主意吗？我是说，你知道那家伙的底细——"

Her covered eye glistened blue when Asuka turned to glare at him. "I said hurry up! Act now, talk later!" She almost unhinged the passenger door while opening it, and shut with a resounding thud.  
当明日香转头瞪向他时，她被遮住的眼睛闪烁着蓝光。“我说了快点！先行动，后解释！”她几乎要把车门扯下来似的猛地打开，然后砰地一声重重关上。

Right after changing his own jacket for a drier one, Kensuke followed suit and stepped on the gas pedal.  
刚换上干爽外套，健介也紧随其后，踩下了油门。

"Stupid brat." The Major punched the door with enough force to hear some of the plastic crack. "There he goes, being an idiot. Can't even perform the simple task of taking care of his damn self."  
"蠢小子。"少校用力捶打门板，以至于能听到一些塑料裂开的声音。"瞧他那副德行，真是个白痴。连照顾好自己这么简单的任务都做不好。"

"Don't you think you're being a little too hard on him?" Kensuke rebuked. Tension was palpable in the car; he was visibly concerned and she was seething in rage. "He's been helping out as best he can, even cooking early in the mornings. And not just for them, for you and me as well. Have you been throwing those bentos out the window? Sure as hell doesn't look like it."  
“你不觉得对他太苛刻了吗？”健介反驳道。车内的紧张气氛显而易见；他明显担忧，而她则怒火中烧。“他一直在尽力帮忙，甚至一大早起来做饭。不仅是为了他们，也是为了你和我。你是不是把那些便当都扔出窗外了？看样子肯定没有。”

"Letting him take over those firewood routes was stupid." Asuka glared at the road, arms crossed, and carried on with a biting undertone. "Told you he was weak. This was nothing but a matter of time."  
"让他接管那些柴火路线真是愚蠢。" 明日香瞪着道路，双臂交叉，语气尖锐地继续说道，"早就告诉过你他很软弱。这一切不过是时间问题罢了。"

"I know, I know, this was stupid. I just thought it'd be good for him to spend some time by himself, and interact with people on his own terms." Kensuke's eyes drifted to the fishing rods sitting in the back seat before refocusing on the road. The rain kept worsening. "I was just telling him about the spot by the ruins this morning. Damn it." He punched his right leg. "Mr. Bunzaemon told me it was going to rain and that the day's work was light. Goddamn it."  
“我知道，我知道，这很蠢。我只是觉得让他独自待一会儿，按自己的方式与人交流会对他有好处。”健介的目光飘向后排座位上的钓竿，随即又回到路面上。雨势愈发猛烈。“今早我只是跟他提了下废墟旁的那个钓点。该死。”他捶了下右腿。“文左卫门先生告诉我今天会下雨，工作也轻松。该死的。”

"Yeah, and still you let him do as he pleases like a spoiled child and are then surprised when he trips and scratches his knee. Tch," Asuka retorted, sarcasm dancing off her tongue. Her eye narrowed at the window. "At least the pampered little boy has the entire village to cater to his recovery. How nice."  
“是啊，你还像纵容一个被宠坏的孩子一样任他随心所欲，然后当他摔倒擦伤膝盖时又感到惊讶。啧，”明日香反驳道，讽刺从她舌尖跳跃而出。她的目光在窗户上眯起。“至少那个被宠坏的小少爷有整个村子的人来照顾他康复。真好。”

"You know as well as I do that being in the village at all is painful for Shinji. Stop being so hard on him," Kensuke said with more firmness. "You don't even mean it, so don't bother. If berating him while he's unconscious is what you wanted to do, you could've just waited in the house until I came back."  
“你我都知道，光是待在村里对真嗣来说就很痛苦了。别对他这么苛刻，”健介语气更加坚定地说，“你根本不是真心的，就别费这个劲了。如果你想在他昏迷时训斥他，大可以就在屋里等我回来。”

Her features darkened under an intense frown. "Don't tell me what to do, _Kenken_. As I said, the brat is my prisoner. I'm just making sure WILLE's cargo hasn't been damaged."  
她眉头紧锁，面色阴沉。“别命令我，Kenken。如我所说，那小鬼是我的俘虏。我只是确认一下 WILLE 的货物没有受损。”

"That's also probably why you follow him while he does the firewood routes, isn't it?" With that last biting question, silence descended inside the car until they reached the village.  
“这也是你跟着他跑柴火路线的原因吧？”随着这句尖锐的提问，车内陷入了沉默，直到他们抵达村庄。

Asuka's molars ground under the strain of her clenched jaw. Kensuke's tone had not even been accusatory, simply inquisitive and strained. She had failed to find an answer to that question for days.  
明日香的后槽牙在她紧咬的牙关下磨得咯咯作响。健介的语气甚至没有一丝责备，只是带着好奇和紧张。她已经好几天没能找到这个问题的答案了。

They reached the village quickly with the man's almost frantic driving. Kensuke went to retrieve the Third Child, who to her surprise walked alongside him instead of needing to be carried. He looked more than exhausted but otherwise in good condition; Toji's old track suit was already on him, and the wounded wrist seemed to have been wrapped in fresh gauze. The boy stumbled twice on his way to the car, supported mainly by Kensuke, and once they were close enough to the door, Asuka glared down at the red jacket in her lap.  
他们很快抵达了村庄，多亏了那男人近乎疯狂的驾驶。真嗣去接第三适格者，令他意外的是，她竟然自己走在他身边，而不是需要被抱。他看起来疲惫至极，但除此之外状态尚好；东治的旧运动服已经穿在他身上，受伤的手腕似乎也缠上了新的纱布。男孩在走向汽车的路上绊倒了两次，主要由真嗣搀扶着，而当他们靠近车门时，明日香瞪着她腿上的红色夹克。

_Great, I brought this thing for nothing. And the brat is conscious. What a waste of time. Ignore the looks, ignore the Lilim, open the door, pull back the seat and let Kensuke put this idiot in the back.  
真是的，白带这玩意儿了。那小鬼还醒着。真是浪费时间。别理会那些眼神，别管莉莉姆，开门，拉回座位，让健介把这个傻瓜塞到后面去。_

No sooner than Shinji was placed inside, she tugged the hat onto his head and stubbornly went back to her seat, ignoring his slurred words of gratitude. The moment his head hit the window she watched his lids close and breathing become deep. He was out cold before she closed the door.  
真嗣刚被放进去，她就一把将帽子扣在他头上，固执地回到自己的座位，对他的含糊感谢置之不理。他的头一靠到车窗上，她就看着他的眼皮合上，呼吸变得深沉。她还没关上门，他就已经昏睡过去了。

"The Ayanami girl found him," Kensuke said once the car started moving and he ensured the boy was indeed unconscious. "They think he might've been lying there for a good twenty minutes. It was raining so hard that everybody stayed indoors. We're lucky she's staying with Toji, otherwise she might not have seen him."  
‘绫波同学发现了他，’车子启动后，健介确认那男孩确实昏迷了，说道，‘他们认为他可能在那儿躺了有二十分钟。雨下得那么大，大家都待在室内。幸好她跟东治在一起，不然她可能看不到他。’

"Shocker, that the Ayanami series would follow the Third. It's almost as if they're wired for it," Asuka snapped. Her eye wandered over the back window, where the faint glimmer of the blue roundel caught her attention. "He goes from one extreme to the other. From doing nothing at almost to drowning in mud and rainwater, and all for what? Now we need some damn soup, blankets, more hot water, firewood, and all so the little brat doesn't catch another cold." Her index finger tapped the door incessantly. "He's just being a pain, even if says he's trying. Stupid brat."  
"真没想到，绫波系列会跟着第三适格者。简直像是天生就该如此，" 明日香厉声说道。她的目光掠过后窗，那里微弱的蓝色圆徽吸引了她的注意。"他从一种极端走向另一种极端。从几乎无所作为到深陷泥泞和雨水之中，这一切又是为了什么？现在我们需要一些该死的汤，毯子，更多的热水，木柴，所有这些都是为了让那个小鬼不再感冒。" 她的食指不停地敲打着车门。"他只是在制造麻烦，即使他说他正在努力。愚蠢的小鬼。"

Kensuke offered a weary smile. "You don't need to do any of that. Shinji was well enough to dress by himself by the time I got in there. If anything, I can make that soup, _and_ we have those oranges Viko gave him this morning. All we have to do is make sure he doesn't catch a cold tonight and it'll all be okay."  
健介疲惫地笑了笑。"你不需要做那些。我进去的时候，真嗣已经能够自己穿衣服了。如果有什么需要做的，我可以做那汤，还有维科今天早上给他的那些橙子。我们只需要确保他今晚不会感冒，一切都会好起来的。"

Asuka said nothing and chose to glare out the window. Aside from placing the dumb little cap on the captive's head, she had basically done little else than grumble through the entire ordeal. Why had she jumped in the damn car at all? Why had she taken the jacket along, knowing the brat was sporting the tracksuit instead?  
明日香一言不发，选择瞪着窗外。除了给那个傻乎乎的小帽子戴在俘虏头上，她基本上除了全程咕哝外什么也没做。她当初干嘛要跳上那该死的车？明知那小鬼穿的是运动服，还带上外套干嘛？

The road back was slower due to the rainfall; the car had trouble climbing up the hill with so much loose dirt around, which only made the silence feel that much more uncomfortable. Shinji was shaken awake by Kensuke once they reached the house, and managed to stagger into the living room and lay on the blankets, body occasionally rocking with a fleeting shudder.  
归途因降雨而变得缓慢；汽车在松散的泥土中艰难爬坡，这使得沉默愈发令人不适。到达家中时，真嗣被健介摇醒，勉强踉跄进客厅，倒在毯子上，身体不时因短暂的颤抖而摇晃。

"I have to go back to the village for a moment, there's some kind of short circuit in the main district. Should be easy enough to fix." Kensuke placed the bag of oranges next to the small sink and stole one for himself. "I'll make some soup the moment I get back." He knelt next to Shinji and placed a hand on his shoulder. "How do you feel, Ikari? You gave us a little scare there."  
"我得回村子一趟，主区那边好像短路了。应该不难修好。" 健介把一袋橙子放在小水槽旁边，顺手拿了一个给自己。"我一回来就煮汤。" 他跪在真嗣旁边，把手放在他的肩上。"感觉怎么样，真嗣？你刚才可把我们吓了一跳。"

"I'm fine," Shinji rasped back with a faint cough. "Sorry for worrying you. I thought I'd be able to… take back the cart… before it rained." He yawned and rubbed at his eyes, shaking his head in an attempt to remain conscious. "I didn't mean to cause any trouble."  
"我没事，" 真嗣嘶哑地回应，伴随着轻微的咳嗽。"抱歉让你担心了。我以为能在下雨前……把推车拉回来。" 他打了个哈欠，揉了揉眼睛，摇摇头试图保持清醒。"我不是故意要惹麻烦的。"

"It's fine, I was going to the village anyway. Just make sure you get some rest, alright?"  
“没关系，反正我也要去村子里。你一定要好好休息，好吗？”

Shinji tried to rise from bed and was pushed back to the blankets. "The rabbit," he panted. "I think I read about… a recipe with an orange sauce. The lady at the ration center gave me that butter yesterday. I bet I can make so-"  
真嗣试图从床上起身，却被按回了被子里。“那只兔子，”他喘着气说，“我想起了一个……用橙汁做的菜谱。配给中心的那位女士昨天给了我一些黄油。我敢打赌我能做出……”

"You can go ahead and cook whatever you want tomorrow," Kensuke interceded as he got to his feet. "Just focus on getting some rest today. Leave the cooking to me for a change, okay?"  
"你明天可以随意做你想做的菜，"健介站起来插话道，"今天就专心休息吧。让我来做饭，换换口味，好吗？"

Whatever Shinji mumbled back fell on deaf ears. Kensuke disappeared outside and Asuka was once again left alone in the house with a brat barely able to talk or feed himself. She saw him tremble, surprised to see his gaze drift to the jacket held in her hand before going back to the blankets.  
无论真嗣咕哝着回应什么，都如同石沉大海。健介消失在门外，而明日香再次独自留在屋内，面对着一个连话都说不清楚、自己吃饭都成问题的小鬼。她看到他颤抖，惊讶地发现他的目光先是飘向她手中的夹克，随后又回到毯子上。

"What?" she demanded with the now usual frown. He shivered again and spared her jacket another fleeting glance. "If you want it because it's warmer than the stupid tracksuit, you can just say so, you know."  
“什么？”她皱着眉质问道，这表情如今已司空见惯。他再次颤抖了一下，又匆匆瞥了一眼她的夹克。“如果你想要它，只是因为它比那愚蠢的运动套装暖和，你大可以直接说，知道吗？”

She did not wait for an answer, choosing instead to throw the jacket at his face. He wasted little time in putting it on; once he zipped it up and fell back in the wall he looked more comfortable and less likely to shiver every three seconds. From her perch by the sink she heard him rub his hands together, and a sidelong glance ensured he wasn't nodding off every other minute. The cumulative fatigue had taken its toll at the least opportune moment.  
她没有等待回答，而是选择将夹克扔向他的脸。他迅速穿上夹克；拉上拉链靠回墙上后，他看起来更自在，不再每隔三秒就打一次哆嗦。她从水槽旁的座位上听到他搓手的声音，斜眼一瞥确认他并未每隔一分钟就打瞌睡。累积的疲劳在最不合时宜的时刻显现了影响。

"You're not making this any easier on any of us with this newfound attitude," Asuka took three oranges and sliced them in half. Squeezing them dry helped calm the unease in her stomach to an extent. "Going from catatonic to a work horse, and then to catatonic again. What's the point of trying if you can't even stand up? God, you're such an idiot."  
“你用这种新态度可没让我们任何人好过，”明日香拿起三个橙子，切成两半。用力挤干它们在一定程度上缓解了她胃里的不安。“从木僵状态到拼命工作，然后又回到木僵。如果你连站都站不起来，努力还有什么意义？天啊，你真是个白痴。”

She pushed the glass of freshly pressed juice into his chest, not bothering to notice how she had called him by the old pet name. "Drink. I'll pour it down your throat if you don't do it yourself, and you know I will."  
她将一杯刚榨好的果汁塞进他胸前，没注意到自己用的是旧时的昵称。“喝吧。你要是不自己喝，我就灌你下去，你知道我做得出来的。”

A pair of shaky hands grabbed the glass; Asuka noticed how cold his skin was when their fingers brushed against each other, perceptible even through the plugsuit. Drained as he was, Shinji was far from the emaciated and pale state he had arrived at the village in. He looked drained to an extent, with dark lines under his lids but nothing more. His eyes were alive, if tired and unfocused at the moment.  
一双颤抖的手抓住了杯子；当他们的手指相触时，明日香注意到他的皮肤有多冷，即便隔着紧身衣也能感觉到。尽管疲惫不堪，但真嗣已不再是刚到村子时那副憔悴苍白的样子。他看起来有些憔悴，眼睑下有黑眼圈，但也就仅此而已。他的眼睛还活着，尽管此刻疲惫且失焦。

"You were a fool to take those carts," Asuka remarked and headed for the kitchen. The jacket and cap worked well enough; he had stopped shaking and looked less likely to fall flat on his face at any second. "Should've stuck to the route that old toad gave you. Now look at you, a shivering mess, and weak as a newborn. Everything's a problem with you."  
"你真是个傻瓜，竟然接了那些车。"明日香说着，朝厨房走去。那件夹克和帽子还算管用，他不再颤抖，看起来也不太可能随时摔个狗啃泥了。"本该听那只老蛤蟆的，坚持走他给你的路线。现在看看你，抖得跟筛糠似的，弱得像个新生儿。对你来说，什么都成了问题。"

_Third shelf to the right, that's where he stored the last of those soup packets Suzuhara gave him. Little bit of water and some of that ginger he brought back should be enough._ However biting her words were, Asuka occupied herself with preparing something warm for him with whatever gas they had left. Her eyebrow twitched when she watched Shinji reach out and touch the roundels from the corner of her eye. _Just freaking_ _**take**_ _the stupid roundels if they're so fascinating to you! Jeez!_  
右边第三个架子，那里放着他最后几包铃原给的汤料包。加点水和带回来的姜片应该就够了。尽管她的话尖锐刺耳，明日香还是用仅剩的煤气为他准备了一些热乎的东西。当她瞥见真嗣伸手去摸那些圆徽时，眉头不由得一跳。要是那么吸引你，干脆就拿走那些该死的圆徽吧！真是的！

"You're so feeble," Asuka growled while the water boiled. "So mentally feeble, and now physically, as well. If that's the way things are gonna be, I don't want you piloting the Eva at all. You'll just get in the way or attack me again."  
"你真是太脆弱了，"明日香咆哮道，水在沸腾。"精神上如此，现在连身体也这样。如果这就是你的状态，我根本不想让你驾驶 Eva。你只会碍事，或者再次攻击我。"

A moment of silence, and then Shinji's voice rang through the echo of rain on the roof.  
片刻的静默后，真嗣的声音在屋顶雨声的回响中响起。

"I'm sorry." The seriousness of his tone made her blink. "I didn't mean to hurt you, and," another stolen glimpse revealed he was staring at the heavy book beside him, "I understand now that what I was trying to do was… really stupid. I think I do, at least."  
“对不起。”他严肃的语气让她不禁眨了眨眼。“我不是有意要伤害你，而且，”他再次偷瞄一眼，只见他正盯着身旁那本厚重的书，“我现在明白了，我之前试图做的那些事……真的很愚蠢。至少我认为是这样。”

Once the soup was prepared, Asuka poured it into a large bowl, took a protein bar from the table and handed both to the Third Child, who took them without objection. Whatever power nap he had managed to squeeze in during the car ride had worked enough to make him somewhat lucid. "Really, now? Some big words read in a dictionary, and now you understand everything? That's gotta be a really good dictionary, then."  
汤一准备好，明日香就将其倒入一个大碗中，从桌上拿起一根蛋白棒，一并递给了第三适格者，他毫无异议地接过。无论他在车程中挤出的那次小憩有多短暂，都足以让他稍微清醒一些。“真的吗？读了几本大词典，现在你就什么都懂了？那这词典一定非常厉害。”

"Did you..." Shinji stared at the bowl of soup before him in wonder, eyes wide. "Did you cook this for me?"  
“你……”真嗣惊讶地盯着面前的汤碗，眼睛睁得大大的。“这是你为我做的吗？”

"I boiled water and poured in the little packet thing Suzuhara gave you days ago. You can hardly call that cooking." The protein bar was pressed against Shinji's bandaged hand. She noticed the large amount of bandaids and small gauze pieces on his fingers. "I can't say carrying firewood is doing you any favors. Now eat, you've been in the storage house already, you know how scarce food is nowadays. Get some fuel into you and go to bed, brat."  
"我烧了水，倒进几天前铃原给你的小袋子里。那可算不上做饭。" 蛋白棒被塞到真嗣包扎的手上。她注意到他手指上贴着大量创可贴和小块纱布。"搬柴火对你可没什么好处。现在吃吧，你已经去过储藏室了，知道现在食物有多紧缺。补充点能量，然后去睡觉，小鬼。"

"I didn't stop to think what repercussions my wishes would have. I was selfish, and childish," Shinji said in between slurps. Visibly famished, he cared little for how hot the soup was and drank it like water, occasionally stopping to take a bite of the protein bar. He wolfed down the food in less than five minutes, pausing only to drink from the glass of orange juice. "I was being a brat."  
“我未曾细想我的愿望会带来什么后果。我自私，幼稚，”真嗣一边吸溜着汤一边说道。他显然饿坏了，对汤的热度毫不在意，像喝水一样喝着，偶尔停下来咬一口蛋白棒。不到五分钟，他就狼吞虎咽地吃完了食物，只是停下来喝了一口橙汁。“我那时真是个小鬼。”

Something about the way he looked was oddly endearing. Whether it was the ragged hair that stuck out from under the hat, or the way his face flushed with satisfaction after emptying the bowl, or perhaps just the sheer ridiculousness of how he looked with the red jacket, black tracksuit pants and black cap... _something_ forced the tiniest chuckle out of Asuka's chest.  
他那副模样不知怎的竟有些讨人喜欢。或许是那顶帽子下翘起的蓬乱头发，或是他吃完碗中食物后脸上泛起的满意红晕，又或许是那件红色夹克、黑色运动裤和黑色帽子的滑稽搭配……总之，有什么东西让明日香忍不住从胸腔里发出了一丝轻笑。

"Heh." She shook her head in derision and sat by the dining room. This counted as the second time in her life she had bothered to so much as boil water for another human being. Why was it always him? "Look at you, making actual sense for once. I guess there's hope for you yet. If you're good enough to think clearly, you're good enough to understand you need to sleep. The Curse of Eva hasn't taken that from you yet. Try and appreciate it."  
“哼。”她轻蔑地摇了摇头，坐在餐厅里。这算是她一生中第二次为别人费心烧水。为什么总是他？“看看你，难得说了一次人话。看来你还有救。既然你脑子清醒，就该明白你需要睡觉。《EVA》的诅咒还没剥夺你这点权利。试着珍惜吧。”

The whisper of Shinji's voice halted her before entering the room.  
碇真嗣的低语声在她踏入房间前止住了她的脚步。

"The curry," he muttered with evident difficulty. "Was it any good? I thought it needed a little salt, and… some more ginger."  
“那咖喱，”他艰难地咕哝道，“味道如何？我觉得它需要加点盐，还有……再多放些姜。”

"Yeah, some more ginger would have been good. It was passable, at best."  
“是啊，再多点姜就好了。最多只能算过得去。”

Amidst the torrent of remorse and guilt, Shinji felt a bit of satisfaction blossom in his chest for once in a long time. Asuka had been eating the bentos.  
在悔恨与愧疚的洪流中，真嗣久违地感到一丝满足在胸中绽放。明日香一直在吃他做的便当。

"I see them all the time, when I fall asleep." He hugged his knees and shivered one final time for the night. "Those Wanderers. I see… shapes… in them. People. Animals. Living beings, moving along their bodies, stuck within them. Sometimes I can't go back to sleep because of that."  
“我经常在入睡时看到它们。”他抱紧双膝，夜晚最后一次颤抖。“那些流浪者。我看到……它们体内的形状……人，动物。活生生的存在，沿着它们的身体移动，被困其中。有时我因此无法再入睡。”

"Yeah," Asuka nodded without looking back. "I see them too, sometimes." The side of her face covered by the eyepatch turned to him. "Go to sleep, Shinji."  
“嗯，”明日香点头，没有回头。“我也偶尔会看到他们。”她用眼罩遮住的那一侧脸转向他。“去睡吧，真嗣。”

It was the second time since emerging from the entry plug that Asuka called him by his name, and probably only the second time she did so ever since they had first met. He lost the battle with drowsiness soon after, falling into a deep slumber that was not in the slightest bit disturbed when Kensuke next arrived.  
这是自离开插入栓后，明日香第二次叫他的名字，或许也是他们初次见面以来的第二次。他很快就被睡意打败，陷入了深沉的睡眠，丝毫未被随后到来的剑介打扰。

Neither the Wanderers nor Kaworu's demise haunted his dreams, for once.  
这一次，流浪者们和渚薰的消逝都没有在他的梦中萦绕。

"Fishing?" “钓鱼？”

The following noon, Shinji stared at the object in his lap in awe and a slight sense of disappointment. "You want me to fish where?"  
次日正午，真嗣凝视着膝上的物件，既敬畏又略感失望。“你想让我在哪儿钓鱼？”

"Right at those ruins where Toji came to pick you up." Kensuke laughed as he drove to the village outskirts, down where the ocean water shone like a mirror from a distance. "I have it from a very trustworthy source that there's good fishing there. We're not a huge settlement, and there's a healthy commerce in between the villages. A single fish every two or three days is more than enough to fill the needed quota, and you can have as much time to yourself there as you want. Sound good?"  
"就在那片废墟，东治来接你的地方。" 真嗣笑着驾车驶向村庄边缘，远处海面如镜般闪耀。"我有个非常可靠的消息来源，那里钓鱼很不错。我们这里不算大聚落，但各村之间商贸往来频繁。每隔两三天钓一条鱼就足够完成配额了，你在那儿想怎么自由就怎么自由。听起来不错吧？"

Gripping the rugged shaft of the fishing rod, Shinji nodded and directed his gaze to the ruins. "Yeah, I suppose. I guess I wasn't much help anyway, was I?"  
紧握着粗糙的钓竿柄，真嗣点点头，将目光投向废墟。“嗯，我想也是。反正我也帮不上什么忙，对吧？”

"Hikari's dad is a crazy old man. He's back on his feet and promised Toji he'll be more careful. Besides, with all the deliveries you made, everybody's set for firewood for at least the next two weeks! You earned a little time off after four days of hard labor. Besides." The vehicle halted a few meters away from the remains of NERV. "You're still cooking in the main hall in the mornings, so you're helping plenty. Ryoji keeps telling me how good that curry tasted!"  
光里的爸爸是个疯狂的老头。他现在恢复得不错，还向冬二保证会更小心。再说了，你送了那么多木柴，大家至少接下来两周都不愁柴火了！你辛苦了四天，也该休息一下了。而且，早上你还在大厅里做饭，帮了不少忙呢。碇君老是跟我说那咖喱有多好吃！

Some color rose to Shinji's cheeks at the mention of the curry. Blurry as it was, the memory of Asuka admitting to having eaten the bentos felt like an incredible accomplishment. Knowing Ryoji and so many others were also enjoying whichever improvised recipes he prepared every morning was also vastly gratifying.  
提到咖喱时，一丝红晕爬上了真嗣的脸颊。尽管记忆模糊，但想起明日香承认吃过便当的那一刻，感觉就像取得了了不起的成就。得知凉宫和其他许多人也在享受他每天早上准备的即兴料理，同样让他感到无比满足。

Once they were standing before the water, Kensuke pointed towards the penguins guiding a school of fish into shallow waters. "You know, there's a life to be had here, Ikari. We'd all be happy if you choose to take it; we'd be overjoyed to have you, no matter what you believe. Hell, even Shikinami's been eating more lately, and looks a bit more relaxed than usual."  
当他们站在水边时，健介指向那些引导鱼群进入浅水的企鹅。“你知道吗，碇，这里也有生活可过。如果你选择留下，我们都会很高兴；无论你信仰什么，我们都无比欢迎你。见鬼，甚至连式冰最近都吃得多了些，看起来比平时放松不少。”

Regardless of how reassuring the words were meant to sound, Shinji's train of thought shifted to the conversation he failed to have with Hikari. Kensuke seemed to know Asuka well; the man was comfortable enough with her presence in the house and did not look overly impressed with her general lack of clothing.  
尽管那些话本意是想让人安心，但真嗣的思绪还是转到了他与光子未能进行的对话上。健介似乎对明日香很了解；他对她在家中的存在感到自在，并没有对她衣着单薄的样子表现出过多的惊讶。

"I'm glad to hear that." Shinji fumbled with the hook, uncertain. "So, what am I supposed to do, now?"  
“很高兴听你这么说。” 真嗣摸索着钩子，有些不确定。“那么，我现在该做什么呢？”

"You just throw the line in the ocean, reel it in every few minutes, and repeat. Heard it's a great way to think, get your mind straight and everything. You get lucky, you just might catch something!" Kensuke headed for the Suzuki after showing Shinji how to handle the fishing rod a few times. "Got errands to run, Ikari! Have fun. I think that Ayanami girl knows about this place as well, so she'll probably drop by, it that's okay."  
“你只需要把线扔进海里，每隔几分钟收一次线，然后重复。听说这是理清思绪的好方法，能让你的头脑清醒。运气好的话，说不定还能钓到点什么！” 真希波在几次示范如何使用钓竿后，朝铃木走去。“我还有事要办，碇！好好玩。我想那个绫波女孩也知道这个地方，所以她可能会过来，如果可以的话。”

"Yeah." Shinji's gaze was already fixed on the ocean. "That's okay."  
“嗯。” 真嗣的目光已经牢牢锁定在海面上。“可以的。”

"Good to know! Remember to get back to the house before dark! See ya in a few, Ikari!"  
“那就好！记得在天黑前回家！一会儿见，碇！”

And so Shinji was left in the peace and quiet of the ruins he had reached on his second day in the village. The very first day of his new fishing 'station' was spent hugging his knees and pondering on his own uselessness. Despite being soaked to the bone the day before, the cares of the rice workers, Rei, and Asuka had prevented any further illness from reaching him. He was perfectly fine to work, but apparently there truly was no further need for him to carry firewood, and the stations around the pillars were full.  
于是，真嗣便在这片他抵达村庄第二天的废墟中享受着宁静。他新渔站的第一个日子，是在抱着膝盖沉思自己的无用中度过的。尽管前一天浑身湿透，但稻农们的忧虑、绫波和明日香的关心，使他免于再次生病。他完全能够工作，但显然，确实不再需要他搬运柴火了，而且柱子周围的站点也都满了。

Shinji though back on Ryoji many a time, pondering on whether or not to tell him of his mother at some point, or at least what he knew and had experienced of her. The latter experiences with her he'd surely avoid, if ever the chance to speak on the subject actually arose. His thoughts also drifted to the girl the villagers happily referred to as Miss Lookalike, and of the times he had sat across from her in Toji's house. Her sparkling gaze was lovely to behold, her inquiries about regularly used terms and overall innocence had made the entire village cherish her. He thought back on Ayanami, on the last time he saw her, and on near Third Impact.  
真嗣多次回想起良治，思考是否该在某一刻告诉他关于母亲的事，或者至少是他所知道和经历过的。对于与她后来的那些经历，如果真有机会谈及这个话题，他肯定会避而不谈。他的思绪也飘向了村民们愉快地称之为“小姐像”的女孩，以及他在当麻家与她相对而坐的时光。她那闪烁的目光令人着迷，她对常用词汇的询问以及整体的纯真，让整个村庄都对她宠爱有加。他回想起绫波，回想起最后一次见到她的情景，以及接近第三次冲击的时刻。

Rei came by late in the afternoon, with rations apparently handed over by Asuka. She asked him about fishing and penguins, and queried his overall health. After a while they descended into a comfortable silence and parted ways. He managed to cook the rabbit at last that night, and while Kensuke complimented the taste and devoured his share, Asuka refused to sit by the table with them. He saved the best cuts of meat with the tastiest gravy in the bento box for the following morning before leaving for work.  
下午晚些时候，真嗣带着显然是明日香递交的口粮来了。她向他询问钓鱼和企鹅的事，还询问了他的整体健康状况。过了一会儿，他们陷入了舒适的沉默，然后各自离开。那天晚上，他终于成功地煮了兔子，尽管健介称赞了味道并狼吞虎咽地吃掉了自己的那份，但明日香拒绝和他们一起坐在桌旁。他在上班前把最美味的肉和最鲜美的肉汁留在了便当盒里，准备第二天早上享用。

On the second day one of the female workers at the main hall gifted Shinji a bundle of spices she grew in her backyard before he left for the ruins. He promised to cook a stew with them, and coincidentally that day caught his first two fish and carried the largest one back to the house. The penguins slowly grew accustomed to him, after the one he assumed to be their leader pecked him on the leg before sundown and nodded its approval. He traded the smaller fish he had caught that day for some kind of peace treaty with them, which seemed to work well enough. That night Asuka mentioned the rabbit had been a bit too oily, but otherwise acceptable.  
第二天，主厅的一位女工在真嗣前往废墟前送给他一捆她在后院种植的香料。他承诺用这些香料煮一锅炖菜，巧合的是那天他捕到了他的前两条鱼，并把最大的那条带回了家。企鹅们慢慢地习惯了他的存在，在他认为是它们首领的那只企鹅在日落前啄了他的腿并点头表示认可之后。他用那天捕到的小鱼与它们达成了某种和平协议，似乎效果还不错。那晚明日香提到兔子有点太油腻了，但其他方面还可以接受。

Shinji shared the stew with the lady the following morning, and was shocked to receive more ingredients than usual, along with many a knowing smile from the crew working by the pillars. The number of lunches he was able to prepare also increased with every passing day. Sensations, tastes and smells were easy to perceive, just as the healing scab on his wrist began to itch instead of ache.  
次日清晨，真嗣与那位女士共享了炖菜，惊讶地收到了比平时更多的食材，柱子旁工作的船员们纷纷投来心领神会的微笑。他每天能准备的午餐数量也与日俱增。感觉、味道和气味都变得易于感知，手腕上愈合的痂开始发痒，而非疼痛。

The shadow of the Wanderers never ceased to frighten Shinji, but Asuka's admittance that she saw those figures as well worked to quiet the worst of his fears at night. After more than a week, she still refused to sit with them at dinner; he always found the bento empty and washed, nonetheless. Having most of his wits back also let Shinji recognize how she wore a scarf around her neck when he was in the vicinity, and realized it was her who gave Rei the rations that served as his lunch.  
流浪者的阴影从未停止过让真嗣感到恐惧，但明日香承认她也看到了那些身影，这让他在夜晚最糟糕的恐惧得以平息。过了一个多星期，她仍然拒绝和他们一起吃晚饭；尽管如此，他总是发现便当盒空空如也且已清洗干净。大部分理智恢复后，真嗣也注意到她在自己附近时脖子上总是围着一条围巾，并意识到是她把那些作为他午餐的配给品给了绫波。

It was on the fourth day, when the Ayanami lookalike left after requesting he give her a name, that he noticed a strange flash of red disappear behind a pillar. It rained that afternoon, and as he huddled under the concrete for warmth with the penguins, Shinji discovered he had yet to try and follow Kensuke's advice.  
在第四天，当那个酷似绫波的女孩离开并请求他给她起个名字时，他注意到一抹奇怪的红色在柱子后消失。那天下午下雨了，当他与企鹅们一起蜷缩在混凝土下取暖时，真嗣发现他还没有尝试过听从 Kensuke 的建议。

"Just talk to her," he said to the leader, who squawked at him in annoyance. "What's there to lose, anymore?"  
“跟她谈谈吧，”他对领头的说，对方不悦地对他嘎嘎叫。“还有什么可失去的呢？”

He noticed the birds huddled together for warmth throughout the length of the rainfall. _Yeah,_ he mused, eyes softening at the group. Memories of a particular semi-sentient pet who also chose to huddle next to its human guardian for warmth, and merrily drank beer alongside her returned. It almost looked as though they were hugging. _That must feel nice._  
他注意到鸟儿们在雨中紧紧依偎在一起取暖。是啊，他沉思着，目光柔和地看着这群鸟。想起了一只特别有灵性的宠物，也喜欢紧挨着它的主人取暖，还高兴地和她一起喝啤酒。它们看起来就像是在拥抱。那一定感觉很好。

"…but you know how Viko gets with any new findings, so he ran off before I could tell him the seed was already cracked in half. Meh, he pouted for that entire afternoon." Ryoji reeled his bait and the line back in the water. "By the way, he said to tell you that fried rice was great, and it was! Man, you have a way in the kitchen, you know."  
“…但你知道 Viko 一有新发现就会兴奋得不得了，所以他跑开前我都没来得及告诉他种子其实已经裂成两半了。唉，他为此整个下午都撅着嘴。” 凌司收好钓饵，重新将钓线投入水中。“对了，他让我转告你，那盘炒饭很棒，确实如此！老兄，你在厨房里真有一手，知道吗？”

"Uhm, thanks." Scratching at his cheek, Shinji readjusted his weight on the box he used as a seat. "It really helps that everybody keeps bringing stuff from their houses. I hope I'm not putting their nice ingredients to waste."  
“呃，谢谢。”真嗣挠了挠脸颊，重新调整了坐在箱子上的姿势。“大家一直从家里带东西来真是帮了大忙。希望我没有浪费他们珍贵的食材。”

"Hey, not only is it ten thousand times better than these," Ryoji held a protein bar for emphasis and bit into it, "not that I'm _complaining_ mind you, and not that these are any sort of milestone to overcome, but... hell." The other boy smiled at the fading sun.  
“嘿，这可比这些强上一万倍，”凌空举起一块蛋白棒以示强调，并咬了一口，“倒不是我在抱怨，你懂的，也不是说这些有什么值得跨越的里程碑，但……见鬼。”另一个男孩对着夕阳微笑。

"Viko keeps bragging about how his brother could make just about anything taste incredible, even in that red waste outside the village. One spoonful of your food, and all he talks is about how great it tastes. Makes me wonder if he was lying all these years!"  
“维科总是吹嘘他哥哥能让任何东西都变得美味，哪怕是在村子外那片红色的荒地上。只要尝一口你的食物，他就一直在说味道有多棒。让我怀疑他这些年是不是一直在撒谎！”

"This Viko, he's a little… odd, isn't he?" Shinji muttered while replacing the bait with a fresher piece in hopes of catching something that day. "Not like I'm one to talk, anyway."  
“这个维科，他有点…古怪，不是吗？” 真嗣一边嘀咕着，一边换上新鲜鱼饵，希望能那天能有所收获。“反正我也不该多说什么。”

"Oh yeah. He's not all here, you know." Shinji turned to see Ryoji tap his temple. "Nobody knows what really happened, apparently not even him. Whatever it was, though, it took away his brother. And it wasn't Third Impact if that's what you're thinking." His normally joyous eyes darkened with anguish. "It was _people_. Whatever happened to him, people did it."  
“哦，没错。他精神不太正常，你知道的。” 真嗣转头看到亮司轻敲自己的太阳穴。“没人知道究竟发生了什么，显然连他自己也不清楚。不管那是什么，它夺走了他的兄弟。而且，如果你在想是不是第三次冲击，那不是。” 他平时充满喜悦的眼眸因痛苦而黯淡。“是人类。无论对他做了什么，都是人类干的。”

His brow furrowed in confusion. "But he's so nice to everyone all the time."  
他眉头紧锁，困惑不解。“但他总是对每个人都那么好。”

"Yeah, that's one of the things that make him weird. He's strangely easy to talk to, isn't he? Say, Shinji. Did you ever have a friend you could just talk to, like I have Viko?"  
“是啊，这就是让他显得古怪的其中一点。他出奇地容易交谈，不是吗？对了，真嗣，你有没有那种可以随便聊聊的朋友，就像我有维科那样？”

_Yes,_ Shinji's mind responded without a second's hesitation. _Kaworu. But he's gone now._ "I used to," he replied once a few moments of pregnant silence passed. "I think I'm being given a chance to have that again, though." The penguins hunted in an organized formation just meters away from them, feasting on a school of sardines. "I still don't understand why, and it's… scary to think I can lose it again."  
是的，真嗣的内心毫不犹豫地回应道。渚薰。但他现在已经不在了。“我曾有过，”他回答道，在片刻的沉默之后。“不过，我想我正被给予一个重新拥有的机会。”几米开外，企鹅们以有序的队形捕食着一群沙丁鱼。“我仍然不明白为什么，而且……想到可能会再次失去，真的很可怕。”

"Yeah, Viko always says to enjoy every moment because it can be your last. And on that note, I'll go enjoy me some dinner!" Ryoji rose and collected his line with a smile. "No luck today! Man, and we caught three of them yesterday with Miss Lookalike cheering us on! Anyway, before I go, I wanted to ask you something."  
“是啊，Viko 总是说要及时行乐，因为下一刻可能就是终点。说到这儿，我得去享受我的晚餐了！”莲治笑着收起钓线，站起身来，“今天运气不佳！昨天我们可是钓到了三条，还有那位长得像 Miss 的女孩给我们加油呢！对了，临走前我想问你件事。”

Shinji blinked at the sudden change of tone in the boy's voice. "Ah, sure. What is it?"  
真嗣对男孩声音突然的变化眨了眨眼。“啊，当然。什么事？”

Ryioji leaned in and whispered. "You know she's there, right? She was there yesterday, too."  
龙二靠近并低声说道。“你知道她在那儿，对吧？她昨天也在那儿。”

The curves of his lips turned upwards; the brief flash of red and green had not been a figment of his imagination, after all. "Yeah, I know."  
他嘴角的弧度微微上扬；那短暂的红绿闪光毕竟不是他的幻觉。“嗯，我知道。”

"So what do you want to do about that?"  
“那你想怎么办？”

"I'm not really sure," _Indecision,_ Shinji's mind recited. _A wavering between two or more possible courses of action._ "I guess I'd like to talk to her. It doesn't have to be about anything important, m-maybe we don't even have to talk at all. It's just..." He looked over at the ocean, and the gentle cerulean, jade and rose hues of the setting sun. "I think it'd be nice to do this with her."  
"我不太确定，"犹豫不决，真嗣的内心反复念叨着。在两种或多种可能的行动方案之间摇摆不定。"我想我愿意和她聊聊。不一定非得是重要的事情，也许我们甚至不需要交谈。只是..." 他望向大海，夕阳柔和的蔚蓝、碧绿与玫瑰色交织在一起。"我觉得和她一起做这件事会很美好。"

"Well, best of luck to you. I'll see you in a couple of days, Shinji! Don't be taking all the fish for yourself! Save some for the penguins!"  
"那么，祝你好运。过几天见，真嗣！别把鱼都独吞了！给企鹅留点儿！"

"Sure… I'll be sure to leave some… for the penguins." Shinji's bounty had been a whopping zero, whilst the avian inhabitants of the ruins feasted on a buffet of sardines. A burst of motion behind him alerted Shinji a few minutes after Ryoji left; he saw the now familiar flash of golden-crimson disappear behind the pillar. "Best of luck, huh."  
“当然……我会留一些……给企鹅们。”真嗣的收获为零，而废墟中的鸟类居民们则享用着沙丁鱼的盛宴。几分钟后，随着亮司离去，一阵动静从背后传来，真嗣瞥见那熟悉的金红色身影一闪而过，消失在柱子后。“祝你好运。”

The following afternoon, Shinji was taken off guard by Rei's absence. As the hours ticked away and he captured three decently sized fish, he thought the day would simply be another quiet one, with nothing but him and his thoughts.  
次日下午，真嗣对绫波的缺席毫无防备。随着时间一分一秒流逝，他钓到了三条相当大的鱼，心想这不过是又一个静谧的日子，只有他和他的思绪相伴。

Quiet footsteps disrupted the gentle sway of waves crashing against the shore; even the waddle of penguins raised their heads in unison at the coming stranger. One of the boxes lying around the area was dragged down next to his and crunched under the weight of the newcomer. A second line was thrown a few feet away from his.  
轻柔的脚步声打断了海浪拍岸的摇曳；就连蹒跚的企鹅们也齐刷刷地抬头望向这位不速之客。一个散落在地的箱子被拖到他旁边，在新来者的重压下嘎吱作响。另一条绳索被抛到了他几英尺外的地方。

"You said you wanted to talk," Asuka said, the side of her eyepatch to him. "So, talk."  
“你说你想谈谈，”明日香说道，眼罩的一侧对着他。“那就说吧。”

作者注：那么！就这样吧！希望这不算糟糕！我知道我的章节长度会随着进展呈指数级增长，但我真的会努力将它们控制在最多 25k 字以内。希望如此。嗯。_

_So, ahem. I suppose it's only fair I communicate this. I felt very stricken by certain parts of the final movie, and yes, I understand the message trying to be portrayed and whatnot, but it hit me hard and for more than one occasion I considered calling it quits on all my Eva fanfic writing. I went through a bit of a depressive state and truly considered 'hanging up the gloves' as it were. Thankfully, my beautiful fiancee and my mofockers in the Asushin Discord managed to get me out of the funk to write this.  
那么，咳咳。我觉得公平起见，应该传达这一点。我对电影的某些部分感到非常触动，是的，我理解试图传达的信息等等，但它对我打击很大，有好几次我考虑过放弃所有关于 Eva 的同人写作。我经历了一段抑郁状态，真的考虑过‘挂起手套’，就此罢手。幸运的是，我美丽的未婚妻和 Asushin Discord 里的朋友们帮我走出了低谷，让我能够写下这个。_

_I hope it's worth the read, and more than anything I hope it's a bit different than my other stories. I'm really trying to turn a new page on all things writing related, so please let me know what can be further improved, or if the pacing was weird! As always, I thank you immensely for taking the time to read this, and eagerly await any and all critiques!

### Chapter 6 So Much Things To Say
The waves broke against the cracked concrete wall and the penguins waddled close, their dark eyes locked on the female wearing a red suit and green jacket. Shinji stared for far too long, unwilling to believe she was sitting there, a fishing rod in her hands, right next to him. His body was stuck in place, rod almost dangling from his numb fingers. Asuka was _here_.  
海浪拍打着裂开的混凝土墙，企鹅们蹒跚靠近，它们深邃的眼睛紧盯着那位身穿红色套装、绿色夹克的女子。真嗣凝视了许久，不愿相信她就坐在那里，手里拿着钓竿，就在他旁边。他的身体僵住了，钓竿几乎要从他麻木的手指间滑落。明日香在这里。

"Nothing you wanna say, then," she dryly remarked as she shifted her weight on the box and threw the line further into the sea. Her head turned just enough so she could glare at him with her uncovered eye. "If you're just going to sit there like a mute, I'm leaving."  
“没什么想说的吗？”她干巴巴地评论道，一边在箱子上调整重心，一边将钓线抛得更远。她的头微微转动，以便用未被遮住的眼睛瞪向他。“如果你只是坐在那里一声不吭，我可要走了。”

Shinji saw her legs begin to move and panicked. "N-No!" he exclaimed loud enough to alert the avian watchers even further. "Wait! I… uhm…" All his questions and subjects thought out through days of sitting in peace by the ocean evaporated like morning dew. "Ah… how di-uhm… did you like the bento this morning?"  
真嗣看到她的腿开始移动，顿时慌了。“不——不要！”他大声喊道，连那些观察的鸟儿都更加警觉了。“等等！我……呃……”他几天来在海边平静地坐着时想好的所有问题和话题，像晨露一样蒸发殆尽。“啊……你……呃……觉得今天早上的便当怎么样？”

_Stupid. Dumb question,_ _**dumb**__. Why would you ask something like that? Haven't you heard Kensuke say she doesn't eat much? Haven't you? Idiot! You ruined it and now she's gon-_  
真蠢。笨问题，真笨。为什么要问这种问题？难道没听剑介说过她吃得不多吗？难道没听过吗？白痴！你搞砸了，现在她要走了——

"It wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be," Asuka replied with nonchalance. The fact that she answered altogether allowed some air to climb back into Shinji's lungs. "Where did you get the tuna filling for the onigiri? Don't think that line there is strong enough to catch one."  
"没我想的那么糟，" 明日香漫不经心地回答。她能如此坦然回应，让真嗣的呼吸稍微顺畅了些。"你从哪儿弄来的金枪鱼饭团馅？别指望那条线能钓上鱼来。"

The words almost sounded like a joke, had her tone not been so flat. Even so, Shinji smiled. "Mr. Bunzaemon brought some to the ration center yesterday morning. I thought it'd go well with the rice we got the other day."  
这番话听起来几乎像是个玩笑，如果她的语气不是那么平淡的话。即便如此，真嗣还是笑了。"文左卫门先生昨天早上带了些到配给中心。我想和我们前几天拿到的米搭配起来应该不错。"

Asuka nodded and stared at the sea. Something about the taste of the rice treat had been familiar, it made her stomach grumble at the memory of a few hours earlier. After a moment she tugged on the line. Nothing. "So that's all you wanted to talk about?"  
明日香点点头，凝视着大海。那种米饭小吃的味道让她感到熟悉，勾起了几个小时前的记忆，肚子不禁咕咕作响。过了一会儿，她拉了拉钓线。什么也没有。"所以你就只想谈这个？"

Panic, or something close to it simmered in Shinji's chest. "No!" The penguins looked up again, with the leader turning its head in curiosity. "I guess… I don't know what to talk about," he said in a haste. Regardless of her constant gloom, having Asuka sit next to him for a while felt heavenly. "I really just wanted to spend some time w-uhm, I really wanted to-"  
恐慌，或者类似的感觉在真嗣的胸中酝酿。“不！”企鹅们再次抬头，领头的那个好奇地转过头来。“我想……我不知道该聊些什么，”他急忙说道。尽管她总是阴沉着脸，但能和明日香坐在一起，感觉就像天堂一样。“我真的只是想花点时间和你在一起——呃，我真的想——”

"Stop being an annoying weakling who can't put three words together?" Asuka interrupted, still not looking at him. "Because you're doing a piss poor job of it right now. Thought you were learning how _not_ to be a brat."  
“别再做个连三个字都说不出来的烦人弱鸡了？”明日香打断道，依旧没有看他。“因为你现在做得糟糕透顶。我还以为你在学着不那么任性呢。”

Recent memories invaded Shinji's mind when a stab of anger and sadness manifested at her words. He was able to read through them with relative ease. She had placed that hat on him and made him soup, after all. Asuka had kept him alive, had gone so far as cleaning the cut on his wrist. _She's just telling you to stop stammering and talk, Shinji,_ he realized with a small smile. _Maybe she wants to talk, too._  
最近的记忆在真嗣的脑海中涌现，她的言语激起了他的愤怒和悲伤。他相对容易地理解了这些记忆。毕竟，是她给他戴上了那顶帽子，还为他做了汤。明日香救了他的命，甚至为他手腕上的伤口清洗过。她只是让你别再结巴，好好说话，真嗣，他带着一丝微笑意识到。也许她也想聊聊。

"I… like to make bentos," he explained. "When I was growing up, I always had to cook for myself, but… sometimes my guardian would ask me to make him some food. It was nice to know I was needed, just for a moment. I liked to pick ingredients I knew he enjoyed."  
“我……喜欢做便当，”他解释道，“我从小就得自己做饭，但……有时候我的监护人会让我给他做些吃的。知道那一刻我是被需要的，感觉很好。我喜欢挑选我知道他喜欢的食材。”

Asuka's features were hidden behind her eye-patch and hair, but he distinctly saw something of a frown on her face. "I don't like sesame seeds, especially the ones that get to this village. Too salty."  
明日香的表情被眼罩和头发遮住，但他明显看到她脸上有一丝皱眉。“我不喜欢芝麻，尤其是这个村子里的那些。太咸了。”

"Oh!" The fear was erased as excitement began to thunder in his chest, so absolute that Shinji almost dropped the fishing rod for a second time. "I'll be sure not to use them next time! Is there something else that you don't like?"  
“哦！”恐惧被胸中涌动的兴奋完全取代，以至于真嗣几乎再次掉落了钓竿。“下次我一定不会用芝麻！还有其他你不喜欢的吗？”

_Kensuke said she doesn't eat much anymore. Maybe if I find out more of what she likes, I can change that just a little. Just a little.  
健介说她现在吃得不多。也许如果我能多了解她喜欢什么，就能稍微改变这一点。只是稍微。_

A pregnant silence after the question made both Shinji and the waddle of penguins shuffle in discomfort. "Doesn't matter," she said, letting Shinji breathe out in relief. "Food is fuel. How it tastes makes no difference."  
问题之后是一阵怀孕般的沉默，这让真嗣和那群摇摇摆摆的企鹅都感到不安。“没关系，”她说，让真嗣松了一口气。“食物就是燃料。味道如何并不重要。”

Shinji noticed how her voice turned bitter, almost spiteful with those words. Trepidation rose in his body, making his hands tremble and his eyes drift to the birds squeaking at his right. Regardless of recent events, he still had no clue how to address her. The strain between them was such that it ignited an ember of anger in his chest. It was frustrating to not be able to do so much as hold a conversation.  
真嗣注意到她的声音变得苦涩，几乎带着怨恨。他感到一阵恐惧，手开始颤抖，眼睛不由自主地瞥向右边吱吱叫的鸟儿。尽管最近发生了这么多事，他仍然不知道该如何与她沟通。他们之间的紧张关系如此之大，以至于在他胸中点燃了一丝愤怒的火花。连进行一次对话都做不到，这让他感到无比沮丧。

"Well, guess that's it, then," Asuka grated, and pushed a box of rations in his direction. "Eat the damn rations or I'll shove them down your th-"  
"好吧，看来就这样了，" 明日香咬牙切齿地说，将一盒口粮推到他面前。"吃掉这些该死的口粮，不然我就把它们塞进你的喉咙……"

"Does it really not matter if it's rations or a bento?" Shinji interrupted, taking a blind leap into a possible argument or fight. "Is the food… bad? I'd like to try and make it better if that's the case."  
"难道口粮和便当真的没区别吗？" 真嗣打断道，盲目地跳入可能的争论或战斗中。"食物……很难吃吗？如果是这样的话，我想办法改进一下。"

Had he been on her uncovered side, Shinji would have seen Asuka roll her eyes. "Everybody seems to be happy with those meals you're making in the mornings."  
如果真嗣在她未被遮盖的一侧，他会看到明日香翻了个白眼。"大家都对你早上做的那些饭菜很满意。"

"Yeah," he conceded. The annoyance made him forget himself. "I just thought… that maybe I could make something that _you_ liked."  
“嗯，”他让步道。恼怒让他忘乎所以。“我只是想……也许我能做出你喜欢的食物。”

Asuka shook the fishing rod, shoulders slumping as she relaxed into the makeshift seat. "Not enough sausages today. The way you cook them, it's not bad. Also, no more sesame seeds as I said. That sauce you made at first, that weird lemon reduction." He watched intently as she shrugged, tugging the jacket hoodie upwards. "It wasn't bad either. Needed some sweet to go with the sour."  
明日香摇了摇钓竿，肩膀随着她放松到临时座位上而下垂。“今天的香肠不够多。你煮的方式还不错。还有，我说过不要再加芝麻了。你最初做的那种奇怪的柠檬酱。”他专注地看着她耸肩，拉起夹克衫的帽子。“那个酱也不差。需要加点甜来中和酸味。”

_Sweet. Okay, She liked the sauce and she likes sweet. But does she, really? What can I… Viko. He has plenty of fruits around, I'm sure there's a few overripe ones he can dispose of. I could make jam! Or… or a nice fruit salad with orange juice!  
甜味。好吧，她喜欢那个酱，也喜欢甜食。但她真的喜欢吗？我能做些什么呢……维科。他那里有很多水果，我肯定有些熟透的他可以处理掉。我可以做果酱！或者……用橙汁做个美味的水果沙拉！_

Excitement had been completely absent ever since he arrived at Tokyo 3 fourteen years before. The slight reveal swelled Shinji's chest with newfound energy. "I'll keep it mind tonight for dinner!" His voice jumped a few octaves, making even Asuka turn in slight surprise. "Ah… and so, what else would you like to…uhm…"  
自从十四年前他来到第三新东京市，兴奋感就彻底消失了。这个小小的揭露让真嗣的胸中涌起了新生的活力。“今晚我会记住做晚餐的！”他的声音提高了几个八度，甚至让明日香都略感惊讶地转过头来。“啊……那么，你还想……呃……”

"Kenken told me that guy in the forge makes sausages sometimes. See if you can get some," she said before he could stumble over his words further. "Fish and rice get old quick, so mix it up. Use your idiot head for something other than staring off into the distance."  
“健健告诉我，锻造厂的那个家伙有时会做香肠。看看你能不能弄一些，”她在他进一步结巴之前说道，“鱼和米饭很快就吃腻了，所以换换口味。用你那笨脑袋做点除了发呆之外的事。”

Yet another needle pressed into the base of Shinji's stomach, and an emptiness engulfed his being. He had been meaning to ask Hikari, Toji or perhaps even the strange blond what the story was with the nickname. _Kenken,_ he thought sadly, but shook his head. _Focus, we're finally talking._ "I'll be sure to try. You know, I wanted to…" His eyes drifted to the mark on his wrist. "I wanted to thank you for helping me, even when I was being a brat. And for putting up with me."  
又一根针刺入了真嗣的腹部，一种空虚感吞噬了他的存在。他本打算问光、或是可能是那个奇怪的金发男子关于这个昵称的来历。健健，他悲伤地想，但摇了摇头。专注，我们终于在交谈了。“我一定会试试。你知道，我想……”他的目光落在了手腕上的标记上。“我想感谢你在我任性时帮助我，还有忍受我。”

The hoodie almost fell from Asuka's head, letting a few strands of golden-crimson shine under the sun. It was… pretty, her hair. "Help you? By jamming protein bars down your throat?" Her tone soured again. "Or by boiling water the other night? Pfft, keep your gratitude. I don't need it."  
连帽衫差点从明日香头上滑落，几缕金红色发丝在阳光下闪耀。她的头发……很美。“帮你？靠往你喉咙里塞蛋白棒吗？”她的语气再次变得尖锐。“还是靠前晚烧水？哼，别谢我，我不需要。”

Her angry retort passed by him with surprising ease. Strange, how her voice seemed a bit unbalanced. "Still, you have it, even if you don't want it. Thank you."  
她愤怒的反驳对他来说意外地轻易就过去了。奇怪，她的声音听起来似乎有些失衡。“尽管你不想接受，但你确实有这份心。谢谢你。”

"Ugh, whatever. You're welcome then, you idiot."  
“呃，随你怎么说。那就算我接受了，你这个笨蛋。”

_Idiot. She called me idiot and not_ _**brat**__. That's twice now. Twice! Keep trying, like that weird guy said! Earn. Earn. Earn._  
白痴。她叫我白痴而不是小鬼。这已经是第二次了。两次！继续努力，就像那个奇怪的家伙说的那样！赚取。赚取。赚取。

Shinji's head perked up, hand gripping the leather strap of the fishing rod. Again, excitement made his heart thunder wildly. He brought his erratic breathing under control, glanced at the eye-patch, and recalled the village leader's remark. If he wanted answers, all he needed to do was ask. Every moment he spent retreating into himself was one he would never get back. He had missed fourteen years of her life, and still dared not ask a thing about them. If the question was too blunt, she was sure to leave in a flash of crimson fury.  
真嗣的头猛地抬起，手紧握着钓竿的皮带。又一次，兴奋让他的心跳得狂野无比。他努力控制住急促的呼吸，瞥了一眼眼罩，回想起村长的评论。如果他想得到答案，只需开口问。他每退缩一秒，都是永远无法挽回的时光。他已经错过了她十四年的生活，却仍不敢问及任何关于那段时光的事情。如果问题太过直接，她肯定会带着一抹绯红的怒气瞬间离去。

"Am I…" he started, and gulped down the uncertainty. "Am I going to stop needing food, or water?" His eyes focused on the ocean and not on the shuffling by his side. "Because of the curse of Eva, I mean."  
“我会……”他开口，咽下了不确定感。“我会不再需要食物或水吗？”他的目光聚焦在海洋上，而不是身旁的人的踌躇。“因为 Eva 的诅咒，我是说。”

The piercing gaze was almost tangible as it tried to burn a hole in his neck. "If you survive long enough for it to advance, yeah." Asuka's voice was surprising level, almost quiet. "Hunger's the first to go, least that's what Four-Eyes says. Starts going away little by little."  
那锐利的目光几乎有形，试图在他的脖子上烧出一个洞。“如果你能活到它发展起来，是的。”明日香的声音出奇地平稳，几乎轻柔。“饥饿是第一个消失的，至少四眼是这么说的。它会一点点消失。”

"How did it happen to you?" The question burst out of his mouth. _Was it my fault? Did I do this? Please tell me I didn't do this._  
“你是怎么变成这样的？”这个问题脱口而出。是我的错吗？是我做的吗？请告诉我这不是我做的。

Their gazes met, a byproduct of the courage he had cultivated. Weary, angry, but not furious like before. Something was different. "For me, the moment I woke up it was all gone," Asuka bit out. "Still ate out of habit for a while before I got sick of those rations. But it was different for me, so who knows how long it'll take you."  
他们的目光相遇，这是他培养出的勇气的副产品。疲惫、愤怒，但没有像以前那样狂怒。有些不同。“对我来说，当我醒来时，一切都消失了，”明日香咬牙切齿地说。“起初我还是出于习惯吃了一段时间，后来对那些口粮感到厌烦。但对我来说情况不同，所以谁知道你会花多长时间。”

"Oh," Shinji's lips felt dry, his throat heavy. Fear made his heartbeat double for a moment. "If I make it that far, anyway," he muttered. The weight of his actions tumbled down again. "I guess I gave my father another weapon for his… scenario."  
"哦，" 真嗣的嘴唇感到干燥，喉咙沉重。恐惧让他的心跳瞬间加速。"如果我能走到那一步的话，" 他喃喃自语。他的行为的后果再次压了下来。"我想我又给了父亲一个他……计划中的武器。"

"Yeah, you did." "是的，你确实给了。"

A fleeting smile tugged at his lips. For once, he had managed to hold her gaze and not shrink into himself. "I'm sorry," he said, meaning it more than ever. "I am."  
一丝转瞬即逝的微笑牵动了他的嘴角。这一次，他设法保持了与她的对视，没有退缩。"我很抱歉，" 他说，比以往任何时候都更真心。"我真的感到抱歉。"

Asuka scowled and turned to the water. "Whatever. At least you're not starving your stupid self."  
明日香皱着眉转向水面。“随你怎么说。至少你没把自己饿得那么蠢。”

"I'm sorry about that, too," he added, recalling the rations, and picked one up.  
“对此我也感到抱歉，”他补充道，想起了那些补给品，并拿起了一块。

It seemed like he would have no luck today either, with not a single catch the entire afternoon. The protein bar was dry and stale, but Asuka had gone to the trouble of bringing it. Every day, the rations would find their way to him, and lately he'd catch a glimpse of red disappear behind a wall or pillar. "Thank you."  
今天似乎又是一无所获，整个下午连一条鱼都没钓到。蛋白棒干巴巴的，已经不新鲜了，但明日香还是费心带了过来。每天，这些补给都会送到他手上，最近他总能瞥见一抹红色消失在墙后或柱子旁。“谢谢你。”

The penguins launched an assault on whatever school of fish neared the ruins, diving into the ocean one after the other and circling the catch. They acted in perfect coordination and maximized the hunt; every member had a task to complete, and ultimately the entire group benefited. Once, for a second during a battle, Shinji had felt such camaraderie.  
企鹅们对靠近废墟的任何鱼群发起了攻击，一只接一只地潜入海洋，围绕着猎物盘旋。它们行动协调一致，最大限度地提高了狩猎效率；每个成员都有任务要完成，最终整个群体都从中受益。曾经，在战斗中的一瞬间，真嗣感受到了这样的团队精神。

"Boring conversation, Third Child," said Asuka. "All you do is go from 'thank you' to 'sorry'. Thought you'd be freaking out."  
"无聊的对话，第三适格者，"明日香说道。"你除了'谢谢'就是'对不起'。我还以为你会吓得要死呢。"

"Well, I've done a lot of that lately," he replied. His voice was strained, yet the terror he thought would stifle him was absent. It was only fitting he was to carry the curse, if he had been the one to unleash it on the entire world. "I guess it won't be so bad once I get used to it. No sleep means more time to work, I guess. More time to try."  
"嗯，最近我确实做了不少，"他回答道。他的声音很紧张，但他以为会让他窒息的恐惧却不见了。如果他是那个将诅咒释放到全世界的人，那么他承担这个诅咒也是理所当然的。"我想一旦习惯了就不会那么糟糕。没有睡眠意味着有更多时间工作，我想。更多时间去尝试。"

His ears must have betrayed him. A small grunt similar to a chuckle rang across the cracked walls. "Heh, that's certainly one way of seeing things. Not scared you won't age, or change? That you'll be trapped in that body forever?"  
他的耳朵一定欺骗了他。一声轻微的咕哝，类似轻笑，在裂开的墙壁间回荡。“呵，这确实是看待事情的一种方式。不担心你不会变老，不会改变吗？你会永远被困在那具身体里吗？”

However terrifying the thought _should_ be, it brought a strange sense of calmness to Shinji. Perhaps the curse also meant he could spend a bit more time with her, and work to earn his permission. "It's already been so long, and it felt like just a blink to me. Doesn't seem fair that everyone else pays for my actions and that I just get to live a normal life or something."  
尽管这个想法本应令人恐惧，却给真嗣带来了一种奇异的平静。或许这个诅咒也意味着他可以多花些时间与她相处，并努力争取她的许可。“已经过去这么久了，对我来说却仿佛眨眼之间。让其他人因我的行为付出代价，而我却能过上正常生活，这似乎不太公平。”

Something shifted in the air. He dared a sidelong glance, noticing how Asuka tugged at the line every few seconds. "Well, good luck with the 'normal life' and all that. Don't want me to kill you anymore, do you?"  
空气中似乎有什么东西在变化。他鼓起勇气斜眼一瞥，注意到明日香每隔几秒就拉一下钓线。“好吧，祝你‘正常生活’一切顺利。你不想让我再杀你一次，对吧？”

"Not at the moment, no," he responded, and chortled. "Haven't even caught a single fish today. If this goes on I'll be starving anyway, though."  
"目前没有，没有，"他回答道，轻声笑了起来。"今天连一条鱼都没钓到。如果这种情况继续下去，我恐怕要挨饿了。"

The slight chuckle was unmissable this time. Shinji's chest swelled with an eagerness that consumed the fear altogether. "What are you, stupid?" Asuka grabbed a second protein bar and threw it at his lap. "One day you come back with five, the next zero. That's just how it is. You'd have to be a freaking penguin to get them so easily."  
这次轻微的笑声无法忽视。真嗣的胸中涌起一股急切，将恐惧完全吞噬。"你是不是傻？"明日香抓起第二块蛋白质棒，扔到他的腿上。"有一天你带回五条，第二天一条都没有。就是这样。你得像企鹅一样才能这么容易钓到它们。"

"Something other than earthworms or rations as bait would help, too," Shinji added while eating the second bar and reeling in the line. He placed a piece of ration on the hook, and threw the line back in the water. "I feel like the fish have wized up to my tricks."  
"用除了蚯蚓或口粮以外的饵料也会有帮助，"真嗣边吃第二块蛋白棒边收线。他将一块口粮挂在钩上，再次将线抛入水中。"我觉得鱼儿们已经识破了我的伎俩。"

"Wouldn't be surprising. So," he heard Asuka say in a much milder tone. "It really doesn't bother you, huh? Saying goodbye to earthy privileges like food or sleep. You think that's part of the penance, don't you?"  
"并不意外。那么，" 他听到明日香用温和得多的语气说道，"你真的不在乎吗？告别食物或睡眠这些尘世的享受。你认为这是赎罪的一部分，对吧？

_We're talking, we're finally talking. Just once, we had an actual conversation. It's… possible! It can be done!  
我们在交谈，我们终于在交谈了。哪怕只有一次，我们进行了真正的对话。这是……可能的！这是可以做到的！_

"Sort of," Shinji admitted. The penguins submerged for a second serving of fresh catch. "Penance or not, it'll still take it all away. I don't know why it doesn't sound so bad. There's so much I'd like to do."  
"算是吧，" 真嗣承认道。企鹅们再次潜入水中捕食新鲜猎物。"无论是赎罪与否，它都会夺走一切。我不知道为什么这听起来并不那么糟糕。我还有很多想做的事情。

"Thought you didn't want to do anything," Asuka countered with forced nonchalance. "Why the sudden change of heart? 'Cause Viko gave you some lemonade? Give me a break, Third."  
"我还以为你不想做任何事呢，" 明日香故作轻松地反驳道，"怎么突然改变主意了？是因为维克给了你一些柠檬水吗？别逗了，三号。"

Despite how annoying the strange blonde man had been at first, Shinji could not help but respect his dedication to helping others. "I think… I'd like to get to know this world," he said, recalling the Wanderers and the shapes within them. "I'd like to try and make it better, however I can. Even if it's just… heh, even if it's just one small fish at a time."  
尽管起初这个奇怪的金发男人很烦人，但真嗣不禁对他帮助他人的执着表示敬意。"我想……我想了解这个世界，"他说着，回想起那些流浪者和他们体内的形态，"我想尽我所能去改善它。即使只是……嘿，即使只是每次帮助一条小鱼。"

_Or one bento at a time, if that's what it takes. I don't think I would mind too much.  
或者一次便当，如果那是必要的。我想我不会介意太多。_

"Remind me to make you haul firewood in the rain the next time you fall into a catatonic depression, then," Asuka remarked with a slight note of mirth. "Or is forcing protein bars down your throat the better path?"  
"下次你再陷入那种木僵状态，记得提醒我让你在雨中搬柴火，" 明日香带着一丝戏谑说道，"还是说，硬塞给你蛋白棒更有效？"

A gust of wind flew by and blew the hoodie off her head, making her hair dance in the wind. It was longer than Shinji remembered, had been ever since he had been retrieved, yet only then did he realize how much it had grown. How much he had missed. The irrational wish of either defeating his father or having the man and his machinations simply disappear began to take root, if only to have more time.  
一阵风吹过，将她的连帽衫帽子吹落，让她的头发在风中飘扬。头发比真嗣记忆中的要长，自从他被找回以来就一直如此，但直到此刻他才意识到它长了多少。他错过了多少。那种不合理的愿望——要么击败他的父亲，要么让那个男人和他的阴谋彻底消失——开始生根，只为争取更多时间。

"I thought I was a prisoner," he recalled in a whisper. Shinji's eyes drifted to the cut again. "Since when do prisoners get to decide where their sentence will be served?"  
"我以为我是囚犯，" 他低声回忆道。真嗣的目光再次飘向那道伤痕，"囚犯什么时候能决定自己的服刑地点了？"

"You _are_ a prisoner," Asuka was quick to clarify, and pointed at her own neck. "In the end we all are, idiot. But nobody's gonna force you onto the ship, if that's what you're wondering."  
"你是个囚犯，" 明日香迅速澄清，并指了指自己的脖子。"最终我们都是，白痴。但没人会强迫你上船，如果你在担心这个的话。"

_Huh? Really?_ "But then, how am I a pris-" Shinji cut himself off, and felt around his neck to feel the collar coldly biting into his skin. "Oh." Shinji forced away the image of Kaworu dying. "What you said the other night," his eyes drifted to the walls, "about me piloting the Eva again."  
“啊？真的吗？“但那样的话，我怎么成囚——” 真嗣打断了自己，摸索着脖子，感受到项圈冰冷地咬进皮肤。“哦。” 真嗣努力驱散脑海中渚薰死去的画面。“你前几晚说的，” 他的目光飘向墙壁，“关于我再次驾驶 EVA 的事。”

"Yeah, what about it?" "““嗯，那又怎样？””

"Nothing, just..." Shinji recoiled for the first time since she arrived, not wishing to break whatever miracle had allowed him to converse so long. "You said you wouldn't want me piloting if I didn't… uhm… change. I thought it was better if I didn't pilot at all. Every time I do, something horrible happens."  
"没什么，只是..." 这是自她到来后，真嗣第一次退缩，不愿打破任何奇迹，让他能如此长久地交谈。"你说过，如果我不...呃...改变，你不会希望我驾驶。我想，如果我根本不驾驶，可能会更好。每次我驾驶，总会有可怕的事情发生。"

"Not every time." He almost choked on his breath at the sound of Asuka's voice. "If this village life is what you want as penance, then good for you." He dared another glance and saw her shrug. "Just thought it would have been nice to have some backup aside from Four-Eyes, for once."  
"并非每次都这样。" 听到明日香的声音，他几乎喘不过气来。"如果这种乡村生活是你想要的赎罪方式，那也挺好。" 他鼓起勇气又看了一眼，见她耸了耸肩。"只是觉得，如果能有个除了四眼之外的帮手，哪怕一次，也不错。"

"Oh." Shinji's train of thought crashed as the figure of a giant creature falling from the skies resurfaced. His hands burned just like that day, almost making him drop the fishing rod. It had been close to an exciting event, minus the imminent fear of death.  
"哦。" 真嗣的思绪被打断，巨型生物从天而降的画面再次浮现。他的手像那天一样灼热，几乎让他丢掉了鱼竿。那本该是个激动人心的时刻，只是死亡的迫近感让人无法忽视。

_Backup? Like that… that one time. She still remembers. And that night, when we talked, when she came to my room. We were a team once; all of us. It feels so long ago, like another life.  
备份？就像那一次……她依然记得。还有那个夜晚，我们交谈时，她来到我的房间。我们曾是一个团队；我们所有人。感觉像是好久以前的事了，仿佛是另一段人生。_

Melancholy accompanied the myriad of emotions that memory brought about. So long ago, for that small moment, he had not been alone. Rei had been attempting to get him and his father to eat together, Misato had behaved as unbothered as he had ever seen her, and Asuka had acted… strange. Distant, but not in an unpleasant way, almost nervous and more irritable than usual.  
忧郁伴随着记忆带来的种种情绪。那么久以前，在那短暂的一刻，他并不孤单。丽曾试图让他和父亲一起吃饭，美里表现得毫不在意，就像他见过的那样，而明日香则表现得……奇怪。疏远，但并不令人不快，几乎有些紧张，比平时更易怒。

For a fleeting period of time, something akin to happiness had coursed through him. Even his father had given the most minuscule acknowledgment of his existence. Was it too much to ask to go back to those days?  
在短暂的时光里，一种类似幸福的感觉涌遍他全身。甚至他的父亲也对他表示了最微小的认可。回到那些日子，是不是要求太多了？

_Yeah. That red sky in front of you, the red sand. The Wanderers, they won't just go away. You lost your right to go back to those days.  
是啊。你眼前的红天，红沙。那些流浪者，他们不会轻易消失。你已经失去了回到那些日子的权利。_

"You'd… trust me in battle?" Shinji asked, too shocked to notice the disbelief ringing through the ruins.  
"你会在战斗中……信任我吗？" 真嗣问道，过于震惊以至于没有注意到废墟中回荡的怀疑。

"Not right now, I wouldn't," Asuka admitted with ease, seemingly unbothered with how long it had taken him to articulate the short response. "But who knows. Desperate times call for desperate measures, after all. Might come a time when you have to do something. Would you?"  
"现在不会，" 明日香轻松地承认，似乎并不介意他花了多长时间来组织这个简短的回答。"但谁知道呢。危急时刻需要非常手段，毕竟。可能会有那么一天，你不得不做些什么。你会吗？"

_Would I?_ Shinji thought back to the trees and the stream. It would be nice to do this again, to have a conversation in that place. If he stayed in the village for the foreseeable future and his father chose to pursue his plans further, everything would most certainly be wiped away. His meager efforts to make amends would amount to nothing.  
我会吗？真嗣回想起那些树木和溪流。再次在那里交谈，该是多么美好。如果他短期内留在村子里，而父亲继续推进他的计划，一切无疑都将被抹去。他那微不足道的弥补努力将化为乌有。

"I don't know," he muttered at last, gaze lost in the reflection of the crisscrossed moon on the water. Inaction had already cost him too much_. Strength,_ he mused from memory. _The quality or state of being physically or mentally strong. Valor. Strength of mind or spirit that enables a person to encounter danger with firmness._ Both words related to Asuka; she was the living embodiment of them in his mind.  
“我不知道，”他终于低声说道，目光迷失在水面上交错的月光倒影中。无所作为已经让他付出了太多代价。力量，他凭记忆思索着。指身体或心理上的强健状态。勇气。心智或精神上的坚强，使人在面对危险时坚定不移。这两个词都与明日香相关；在他心中，她是这些品质的活生生的体现。

Asuka huffed in exasperation. "Wow, what an eloquent response. So reassuring, too. _Great_ work."  
明日香恼怒地哼了一声。“哇，多么有文采的回答。也真让人安心。干得漂亮。”

The comment elicited a sad chuckle. It felt easier to smile lately, easier to laugh too. Even the dreadful news of knowing any version of his future was rather bleak did not much bother him. "I'm sorry. I just… I don't want to hurt anyone else."  
这番话引出了一声苦笑。近来，微笑似乎变得容易了，笑声亦然。即便得知自己未来的任何版本都颇为黯淡，这消息也并未过多困扰他。“对不起。我只是……我不想再伤害任何人了。”

"And if everybody gets hurt because you _won't_ pilot, what then?"  
“如果你不驾驶，结果所有人都因此受伤，那又怎么办？”

He turned, surprised to see Asuka staring back. "I still don't know."  
他转过身，惊讶地看到明日香正盯着他。“我还是不知道。”

"Fair enough." Asuka's eye narrowed, almost as though she were studying him. "You're really not freaking out about the curse, are you? Say by some miracle we don't die or become whatever plasma energy your father needs, you're still trapped in that body for who knows how long. No food, no sleep."  
"说得也是。" 明日香眯起眼睛，几乎像是在审视他。"你真的没有因为诅咒而抓狂，对吧？就算奇迹发生，我们没有死掉或者变成你父亲需要的等离子能量，你还是会被困在那具身体里，谁知道要多久。没有食物，没有睡眠。"

"Yeah, but..." Shinji offered a tentative smile. "That means I'd be able to talk to you more often, so it wouldn't be so bad."  
"是啊，但是..." 真嗣试探性地笑了笑。"那意味着我可以更频繁地和你说话，所以也不会那么糟糕。"

_What._ His face immediately heated up, and for a third time that afternoon his pulse quickened as it had during that night years before. _Why did I say that?_  
什么。他的脸立刻热了起来，那天下午第三次，他的心跳加速，就像多年前那个夜晚一样。我为什么要说那句话？

Had he not chosen to look away then, Shinji would have caught color rising to Asuka's face as her head whipped in the opposite side. "What kind of crap is that?" she demanded with an uneven tone. "So you're just gonna talk through the night because sleep won't come or something?"  
如果那时他没有选择移开视线，真嗣就会注意到明日香的脸颊因头部猛地转向另一侧而泛起红晕。“那算什么鬼话？”她用不稳的语调质问道，“所以你就打算整晚聊天，因为睡不着还是怎么的？”

The statement rang as both as a threat and a suggestion. The rod fell from his fingers and would have dropped into the water, had he not reacted in time to retrieve it. "I... wouldn't want to impose or anything."  
这句话既像威胁又似提议。钓竿从他指间滑落，若非他及时反应，恐怕早已落入水中。“我……不想打扰你或什么的。”

"Nights without sleep are boring," Asuka replied. "Guess even hearing your dumb stammering wouldn't be so horrible after a while."  
“失眠的夜晚很无聊，”明日香回答，“我想，听你那愚蠢的结巴也不会太糟糕，过一会儿也就习惯了。”

The waves crashed into the bay, just as waves of newfound interest flooded Shinji's being. The mystery of Asuka's life both before and after Unit 01 took him into its core could finally be explored. At some point, maybe, he could ask her about the eye-patch, or the roundels. He could learn about her just as he learned about the village. Asuka's light chuckle had been as welcoming as the songs in the old SDAT, albeit new and refreshing like the water that ran through the clearing.  
海浪拍击着海湾，正如一股新生的兴趣浪潮涌入真嗣的内心。关于明日香在零一机之前和之后的生活之谜，终于可以被探索了。也许在某个时刻，他可以问她关于眼罩的事，或是那些圆盘。他可以像了解村庄一样了解明日香。明日香轻快的笑声就像旧 SDAT 里的歌曲一样欢迎，尽管像流经空地的水一样新鲜而令人耳目一新。

"I'll try not to sound dumb, or stammer as much," he said at last. It was a faltering agreement, one better left unspoken due to its own volatile nature. "But… there's a lot I'd love to ask, if I ever get the chance."  
“我会尽量不显得愚蠢，也不那么结巴，”他终于说道。这是一个犹豫不决的同意，由于其自身的易变性，最好不曾说出口。“但是……如果我有机会，有很多事情我想问。”

"No better time than the present, Third." Asuka addressed him with a glare, eye gleaming with wrath. Her body language was suddenly displaying fierceness. "If it's about the eye-patch, it's got a little to do wi-"  
“没有比现在更好的时机了，第三。”明日香带着怒意瞪着他，眼中闪烁着愤怒。她的肢体语言突然显得凶猛。“如果是关于眼罩的事，它有点和——”

Shinji was straining to hear, almost leaning in completely to her side when a fish decided to bite at long last. Having gotten their fill of snacks, the penguins had opted to circle around the school of fish and drive them towards the bait. A particularly large and stubborn one clamped down on Asuka's line, struggling with sufficient vigor to have her stand and pull the fishing rod back with all her strength.  
真嗣努力倾听着，几乎完全侧身向她那边倾斜，这时一条鱼终于咬钩了。吃饱了零食的企鹅们选择绕着鱼群转圈，将它们驱赶到鱼饵附近。一条特别大且顽固的鱼咬住了明日香的钓线，挣扎得如此有力，以至于她不得不站起来，全力向后拉钓竿。

"Hey!" she yelled, and Shinji was instantly on his feet. "How the hell am I supposed to… god damn, you stupid fish, come here!"  
“嘿！”她喊道，真嗣立刻站了起来。“我怎么可能……该死，你这蠢鱼，过来！”

"Wait, don't just pull at the line like that, the fish might get free!" Without realizing, Shinji mimicked the lesson Kaji Jr had given him on proper fishing and stood behind Asuka, too afraid to touch her. "You have to reel it in, so give it time to just swim around for a second and not struggle… yeah, exactly!" The thought of losing the only catch of the day drove his hands to grasp hers. "Just let it swim around for a second, and then… now!"  
“等等，别那样直接拉线，鱼可能会逃掉的！”真嗣不知不觉模仿起卡吉 Jr 教他的正确钓鱼方法，站在明日香身后，不敢触碰她。“你得卷线，给它点时间游一会儿，别挣扎……对，就是这样！”想到可能会失去今天唯一的收获，他的手不由自主地握住了她的手。“让它游一会儿，然后……现在！”

Asuka rotated the roller, doing as instructed with little complaint aside from a growl and a heated glare. The fish exploded out of the water, splashing them both as it battled the hook and slapped away with its tail. Shinji was quick to grab the small net the forge master had provided, and secured the catch before it could wiggle its way back to safety.  
明日香转动着卷轴，尽管有些不满地咕哝了一声并投以热烈的瞪视，但还是照做了。鱼儿猛地跃出水面，溅了他们一身水，挣扎着试图摆脱钩子并用尾巴拍打着。真嗣迅速抓起锻造大师提供的渔网，将猎物牢牢固定，以防它扭动着逃回安全之地。

Once they were certain their likely dinner was not jumping away, both youngsters realized how close to each other they were standing. Asuka was about to throw a punch when Shinji moved away on instinct, and walked over to collect his own fishing rod from the ground. He felt her eyes on him the entire time; in their mad dash to secure the prey, the physical contact barrier had been breached. Whatever fortified glass had been standing between them was shattered.  
当他们确信晚餐不会跳走后，两个年轻人意识到他们站得有多近。明日香正要挥拳时，真嗣本能地退开，走过去从地上拿起自己的钓竿。他感觉到她的目光一直跟随着他；在疯狂地捕捉猎物的过程中，身体接触的界限已被打破。无论之前他们之间竖立着怎样的坚固玻璃，此刻都已粉碎。

"So." Asuka turned back to the pillars and pocketed both hands. "You're not cooking that thing here? Fresh catch and all that?"  
“那么。”明日香转回身面对着柱子，双手插进口袋。“你不打算在这里烹饪那东西吗？新鲜的捕获物什么的。”

Shinji looked around for possible elements to be used for a makeshift fire, taken aback by the strange request, but found no firewood, or anything close to it. "Uhm… not today? I don't have a knife or firewood."  
真嗣四处寻找可以用来生火的材料，对这个奇怪的要求感到意外，但却没有找到任何木柴，或是类似的东西。“呃……今天不行？我没有刀也没有木柴。”

"Huh, shame," said Asuka, and started walking away, leaving the rod she had brought on the ground. Instead of pulling up her hoodie, Asuka drew her hair out and let it cascade down her back. Again, Shinji thought it was pretty. Bright. "Well, have the kitchen ready for next time, then."  
“哼，真可惜，”明日香说着，开始走开，把带来的钓竿留在了地上。她没有拉起连帽衫的帽子，而是把头发散开，让它垂落在背后。真嗣再次觉得这样很美，明亮动人。“好吧，下次记得准备好厨房。”

_Next time? You mean you'll be back? You want me to cook this for you…_ _**here**__? But I thought you didn't need food! But then why did she tell me she didn't dislike the bentos? Has she… been getting hungry again?_  
下次？你是说你会回来？你想让我在这里为你做这个……？但我觉得你不需要食物！可她为什么又告诉我她不讨厌便当呢？难道她……又开始饿了？

His mind started going in all directions, enticed by the seemingly endless amount of possible questions he could formulate. Only when the waterfall of red hair was about to fade behind the wall did he realize that he had not yet articulated a response. "Uhm, A-Asuka!" When she didn't turn back, he cleared his throat and called out again. "Asuka!"  
他的思绪开始四处飘散，被似乎无穷无尽的可能问题所吸引。直到那瀑布般的红发即将消失在墙后，他才意识到自己还未作出回应。“呃，A-明日香！”见她没有回头，他清了清嗓子，再次喊道：“明日香！”

"What?" she yelled back, still walking away.  
“什么？”她大声回应，依旧向前走去。

"Thank you for coming around today! A-And for coming over the other days, too! And for bringing the rations!" She paused after he mentioned the past few days and his noticing of her stealthy visits. "I'm really glad to have had this talk!"  
“谢谢你今天过来！还有前几天也来了！还有带了补给！”他在提到过去几天和她悄悄的来访后停顿了一下。“真的很高兴能和你聊这些！”

It shocked him to see her shoulders slump and her head shake in derision. "Why?" He was about to respond when she continued walking away. "You know what? Doesn't matter. Whatever, remember what I said about the sesame seeds."  
看到她肩膀垮下，头摇得满是嘲讽，他震惊不已。“为什么？”他正要回应，她却继续走开了。“你知道吗？无所谓了。随便吧，记得我说的关于芝麻的事。”

"I will!" “我会的！”

Her footfalls faded away under the sound of waves and breeze. Shinji sat by the shore for a good while after Asuka left, gathering up the rods and lines and storing away both makeshift seats where rain would not damage them. The waddle of penguins observed his every move, heads shifting towards the bag where the fish was stored. Catching the fish might have not been coincidence at all, so to please the avian companions and co-conspirators, Shinji offered a hesitant bow.  
她的脚步声在海浪与微风中渐渐消失。明日香离开后，真嗣在岸边坐了许久，收拾起钓竿和线，将临时座椅藏好以免雨水损坏。企鹅们摇摇摆摆地观察着他的一举一动，脑袋转向存放鱼儿的袋子。捕到鱼或许并非偶然，为了取悦这些鸟类伙伴和共谋者，真嗣犹豫地鞠了一躬。

The leader fluffed its feathers and squeaked in irritation. He smiled. It felt good to smile again.  
领头的抖了抖羽毛，发出恼怒的吱吱声。他笑了。再次微笑的感觉真好。

"Yeah, I can definitely do better than that, you're right. You saved me before I ruined it." A gust of cold, dry air brushed against him. The scent of salt, LCL, and strawberry. Asuka's hair dancing in the wind, shining under the sunset sun. "Pretty," he whispered to the fading light.  
“是啊，我肯定能做得比那更好，你说得对。你救了我，不然我就搞砸了。”一阵冷冽干燥的风拂过他。海盐、LCL 和草莓的气息。明日香的发丝在风中飘扬，在夕阳下闪闪发光。“真美，”他对着渐渐消逝的光芒低语。

"Pleasing or attractive to the eye, as by delicacy or gracefulness."  
“悦目或吸引眼球，因其精致或优雅。”

---

The splinter stung as it embedded itself in his finger with no consideration for the glove.  
木刺毫不顾及手套的存在，刺入他的手指，带来一阵刺痛。

Ryoji cursed and instantly removed the earbuds. His head whipped in all directions to ensure his guardian was not around, and breathed a sigh of relief. Of all the strange quirks Viko had, his rejection of foul language was by far the weirdest. With no deranged blonde to criticize, he pressed play on the 'borrowed' music player and kept on with the task.  
莲二咒骂一声，立刻摘下耳机。他四处张望，确保监护人不在附近，然后松了口气。在维克多的所有古怪习惯中，对脏话的排斥无疑是最奇怪的。既然没有那个疯疯癫癫的金发小子来批评他，他便按下那个“借来”的音乐播放器，继续手头的任务。

Lemons were quick to catch fungi and rot away that time of the year. Letting the fruit fall to the ground was not an option; sprouts and seeds were too precious to waste, so the local botany expert put all the youngsters to work. Their payment was mostly a part of the bounty, and occasionally some sweet caramels the man concocted, which always had a sour-sweet taste to them. His treats were famous in the village, and held value as both dessert and a bargaining chip.  
柠檬在那个季节很容易滋生霉菌并腐烂。让果实掉落在地不是办法；芽和种子太过珍贵，不能浪费，因此当地的植物学专家让所有年轻人都投入了工作。他们的报酬主要是部分收获，偶尔还有那位专家调制的甜味焦糖，总是带有酸甜的味道。他的甜点在村子里很有名，既可作为甜点，也可作为交易的筹码。

"Kill your suffering and drown your tears, happiness beyond all that's real," he sang and swayed with the heavy riffs. "This room of nightmare, so much to see. This room of nightmare shall set you free!"  
"扼杀你的痛苦，淹没你的泪水，幸福超越一切现实，"他随着沉重的吉他 riff 唱着，摇摆着。"这个噩梦般的房间，有太多可看。这个噩梦般的房间将让你自由！"

Too engrossed in the music and the task, Ryoji failed to notice a cerulean eye shine through the morning sun, hidden away under a tree, and narrow at his disjointed movements. After filling a second bag with ripe fruit, he moved over to the pears and apples. Viko took great care of these trees, fiercely protecting them against disease or drought. Apples were Ryoji's favorites, after all.  
过于沉浸在音乐和任务中，Ryoji 没有注意到透过晨光，在树下隐匿处，一只天蓝色的眼睛正盯着他支离破碎的动作，目光锐利。在装满第二袋成熟水果后，他移步到梨树和苹果树旁。Viko 对这些树照顾有加，竭力保护它们免受疾病或干旱的侵害。毕竟，苹果是 Ryoji 的最爱。

"Set you free!" he sang with a grin. It felt good to not wear that heavy suit for once. "Close your eyes and you will see!"  
"让你自由！"他带着笑容唱道。感觉真好，终于不用再穿那件沉重的套装了。"闭上眼睛，你将看见！"

He collected a good ten ripe apples before realizing he was not alone in the small forest. The hairs on his nape stood on end, his instincts flaring as though he were in danger, or in the presence of a predator. Fearing the worst such as the apparitions, red wolves and wandering monsters his guardian had described when he was younger, Ryoji almost jumped into the stream when he saw the red suit and crimson-golden hair.  
他在小森林里摘了足足十个熟透的苹果，才意识到自己并非独自一人。颈后的毛发竖起，本能警觉地告诉他似乎身处险境，或是遇到了捕食者。担心会遇到守护者在他年幼时描述的幽灵、红狼和游荡的怪物，当看到那身红色西装和赤金色头发时，凌司差点跳进溪流中。

"Wow!" he took a step back in shock, not expecting to find the mysterious Second Child sitting on a log near the water. She offered no acknowledgment towards his presence except a slight glare.  
"哇！"他震惊地后退一步，没想到会在这里遇到神秘的第二适格者，她正坐在水边的木头上。她对他的出现毫无反应，只是微微瞪了他一眼。

"You're loud," Asuka commented. She laid back on the log and crossed her arms. "And your accent sucks. By far the worst I've heard in a while."  
"你声音太大了，"明日香评论道。她向后仰躺在木头上，双臂交叉。"而且你的口音真糟糕。这段时间以来听过的最差劲的。"

_Well, you're just a ray of sunshine, aren't you? I totally don't feel like I'm being stalked by an angry beast right now,_ Ryoji thought dispassionately and produced an apple from the bag. He threw it her way. Shikinami caught it in midair and stowed it in the green jacket.  
哎呀，你真是个小太阳，不是吗？我完全不觉得自己现在正被一只愤怒的野兽跟踪，Ryoji 冷漠地想着，从袋子里拿出一个苹果。他朝她扔了过去。Shikinami 在空中接住，然后把它塞进了绿色夹克里。

"Hello, Major. It is 'Major' now, right?" said Ryoji, taking a fruit for himself. "Been a while since I've seen you."  
“你好，少校。现在应该称呼你为‘少校’了吧？”Ryoji 说着，给自己拿了一个水果。“好久不见了。”

Her cold gaze fixed on him for a few seconds before moving over to the peach sprouts. "You look a bit like your mother. You behave a little like she used to, as well. Carefree and idiotic."  
她冰冷的目光在他身上停留了几秒钟，然后转向了桃树苗。“你看起来有点像你母亲。你的行为也和她有些相似，无忧无虑又愚蠢。”

_Damn, an insult of endearment. How amazing that Mr. Kensuke has to deal with this on a daily basis when she's not in that giant ship._ Ryoji shuddered at the thought. "So, you know who my mom is?" He tried to sound uninterested and failed spectacularly. The bitterness almost leaked off his voice. "You say she used to be carefree?"  
"该死，这算是一种亲昵的侮辱吧。真难以想象健介先生每天都要面对这种情况，而她不在那艘巨舰上时。莲二不禁打了个寒颤。“那么，你知道我妈妈是谁吗？”他试图表现得漠不关心，却失败得一塌糊涂。苦涩几乎要从他的声音中溢出。“你说她曾经无忧无虑？””

"Yeah, when the world wasn't as broken as it is now." He saw the strange young woman tug at her hoodie to further obscure the eye-patch. "She actually used to be fun to hang out with. Then your father died and, well… things got worse."  
"“是啊，当这个世界还没像现在这样支离破碎的时候。”他注意到那位奇怪的年轻女子拉了拉她的连帽衫，以进一步遮住眼罩。“她其实曾经是个很有趣的玩伴。然后你父亲去世了，嗯……事情就变得更糟了。””

"This is a sudden, bitter and quite honestly sad conversation," Ryoji stated as he leaned against the apple tree, staring at her back with a frown. Speaking of his mother or father had been souring his mood as of late. Viko attributed it entirely to his age. "You came all the way out here to tell me my mother used to be a fun person, but is not anymore?"  
"“这真是一个突如其来、苦涩且坦白说令人伤感的对话，”莲二靠在苹果树上，皱着眉头盯着她的背影说道。最近提到他的母亲或父亲总是让他的心情变得糟糕。维科将这完全归咎于他的年龄。“你大老远跑来这里，就是为了告诉我，我母亲曾经是个有趣的人，但现在不是了？””

Shikinami shrugged and turned further away. It irked Ryoji further how she did not bother to turn back, and instead produced some strange handheld device and began to press buttons. "I came out to have some fresh air, you just happened to be here."  
式波耸了耸肩，转身更远地避开。这让绫人更加恼火，她竟然连头也不回，而是拿出一个奇怪的手持设备开始按按钮。“我只是出来透透气，你刚好在这里。”

"I'm happy to listen to my music and go about my job, thank you," Ryoji almost snarled back. Something about the girl rubbed him the wrong way. "I appreciate the incredible insight on the woman who left me here alone. Thank you!"  
“我很乐意听我的音乐，继续我的工作，谢谢，”绫人几乎咆哮着回敬。这个女孩让他感到不舒服。“感谢你对那个把我一个人留在这里的女人的深刻见解！谢谢！”

He gave a mocking bow and almost ripped the next apple from the tree, munching on his snack with furious bites. The fruit was juicy and sweet, and its flavor helped him forget about the intruder for a while. Three more pear trees needed his attention, yet Ryoji's feet refused to move another step, throwing heated glares at the pilot ever so often.  
他嘲讽地鞠了一躬，几乎是从树上扯下下一个苹果，愤怒地大口啃着零食。水果多汁而甜美，它的味道让他暂时忘记了入侵者。还有三棵梨树需要他照顾，但绫人的脚却拒绝再移动一步，时不时向那位驾驶员投去愤怒的目光。

_Don't fall for her game, that's what she wants._ He urged himself to stay quiet and walked to the nearest peach sapling. Pretending to study it was easier than pretending she was not there. _Just keep doing your job and forget about what she said. Not like Viko hasn't told you about your oh-so-heroic mother._  
别中了她的圈套，那正是她想要的。他告诫自己保持沉默，走向最近的桃树苗。假装研究它比假装她不在那里要容易得多。继续做好你的工作，忘掉她说过的话。不像 Viko 没跟你提过你那所谓的英雄母亲。

Silence stretched out, disturbed only by the sound of the water, the music in his ears and the chirp of birds. The sound effects of her game began to make his eyebrow twitch as he accidentally plucked a healthy leaf from a young plant. "Ah, god damn it!" He rose and kicked the ground twice. "Man, Shinji's way better at this than I am, how come I'm the one struck with this damn plant duty?"  
沉默蔓延开来，只被水声、他耳中的音乐和鸟鸣所打破。她游戏的音效开始让他的眉毛抽搐，他不小心从一株幼苗上摘下了一片健康的叶子。“啊，该死！”他站起来踢了地面两下。“伙计，真嗣在这方面比我强多了，怎么偏偏是我摊上这该死的植物任务？”

"The brat's over at Suzuhara's house," explained his unwanted guest. "Old man Horaki needed some help, and Kenken offered to take the idiot there these next few days. You'd rather haul wood than collect lemons and apples?"  
“那小子在铃原家，”他那位不请自来的客人解释道，“老堀木需要帮忙，健健提议这几天带那傻瓜过去。你宁愿搬木头也不想摘柠檬和苹果吗？”

Ryoji groaned in discomfort. Why did the damn 'untouchable' Shikinami have to come and ruin his nice, quiet day? "I don't mind, I just don't have the dexterity needed to do this properly." His eyes drifted to the row of growing plants. "Every tree means hundreds of new seeds we can send to the other villages, so it's important work. I don't like to think I'll mess it up by not paying enough attention."  
莲司不满地哼了一声。为什么那个该死的‘不可触碰’的式岛非得来破坏他宁静的一天？“我并不介意，只是我没有足够的手巧来做好这件事。”他的目光飘向那一排正在生长的植物。“每棵树都意味着数百颗新种子，我们可以送到其他村庄，所以这是重要的工作。我不愿因不够专注而搞砸它。”

"Hmm." Shikinami continued to play, paying little mind to his souring mood. "It's not like the brat can be any better at this, seeing how he can barely articulate sitting and fishing all afternoon."  
“嗯。”式岛继续弹奏，对他的坏心情不以为意。“那小子也不见得能做得更好，看他连坐一下午钓鱼都表达不清的样子。”

Even if Ryoji hardly knew Shinji, hearing him be referred to as a brat after watching how intently he worked stoked the flames of his anger. "Why do you talk about him like that? Why are you even talking to me right now? I was perfectly happy doing my work, but you know what? If it means having to hear you complain about Shinji or saying some cryptic crap about my mother, I can always come back later."  
尽管莲司对真嗣了解不多，但看到他如此专注地工作却被称作小子，这激起了他的怒火。“你为什么那样说他？你现在又为什么要跟我说话？我本来很高兴地在做我的工作，但你知道吗？如果这意味着要听你抱怨真嗣或说些关于我母亲的隐晦废话，我完全可以晚点再回来。”

"What you do is not my business. So long as you don't do anything stupid like, say-" Shikinami pocketed the device, and produced the recruiting form he had given Kensuke two days before. "Trying to participate is this never-ending war of ours. There's a reason your mother left you here." She ripped the paper in half and then into smaller pieces.  
"你的所作所为与我无关。只要你别做出什么愚蠢的事，比如说——" 式波将那装置收进口袋，又拿出了两天前交给健介的招募表格。"试图参与我们这场无休止的战争。你母亲把你留在这里是有原因的。" 她将纸张撕成两半，然后又撕得更碎。

"Hey! I worked hard on that application!" After three curt steps Ryoji was next to her, almost screaming at the top of his lungs and trying to rescue whatever remained of the form. "I did everything Mr. Kensuke asked me to do! Why would you do this?"  
"嘿！我可是费了很大劲才填好那份申请的！" 经过三步急促的步伐，凉二来到她身边，几乎是用尽全力地喊着，试图抢救那张表格的残骸。"我按照健介先生要求的一切做了！你为什么要这么做？"

"Because you're really dumb if you think either Kenken, your mother or that crazy guardian of yours are gonna let you partake in this mess." Shikinami's reply came with a voice of steel, with no room for argument or retaliation. She was Kensuke's superior after all, in charge of the village's defense. "Be happy you have people who don't want you to be cannon fodder for war, _brat_."  
"因为你真是蠢到以为健介、你母亲或是你那位疯狂的监护人会允许你卷入这场混乱。" 式波的回答冷硬如铁，毫无商量的余地。毕竟，她是健介的上级，负责村庄的防御。"庆幸你有那些不想让你成为战争炮灰的人吧，小子。"

"You-you're just… this…" The papers crinkled in his hands. He had talked about getting on the Wunder with Shinji the last time they had caught some fish together. She had surely heard about his plans whilst spying on the Third Child. "This is _my_ decision! _My_ life! Who the hell do you think you are, to not let me go see my mom?"  
"你-你只是……这样……" 纸张在他手中沙沙作响。上次他们一起钓鱼时，他曾谈及与真嗣一起登上 Wunder 号的计划。她肯定是在监视第三适格者时听到了他的打算。"这是我的决定！我的生活！你以为你是谁，凭什么不让我去看我妈妈？"

"It was your mother who sent you here. Believe me when I say it was to protect you." Shikinami stood and walked over to Viko's preferred perch. "Forget all about this fighting nonsense, it's for the best."  
"是你母亲把你送到这里的。相信我，这是为了保护你。" 式波站起身，走向维科喜欢的栖息处。"忘掉这些无谓的战斗吧，这是最好的选择。"

"No!" He clutched the remnants of the application against his chest. "I just want to help like Mr. Kensuke does, like Viko!"  
"不！" 他紧抓着申请表的残片贴在胸前。"我只是想像健介先生那样帮忙，像维科那样！"

"Then keep taking care of these plants and trees. That's what everybody wants for you. You're not cursed." Shikinami pointed at her eye-patch. "You get to live a somewhat normal, happy life. Why don't you learn to appreciate that? Not all of us are so lucky."  
"那就继续照顾这些植物和树木吧。这是大家都希望你做的。你并没有被诅咒。" 式波指了指她的眼罩。"你可以过上相对正常、快乐的生活。为什么不学会珍惜这一点呢？并不是所有人都有这样的幸运。"

Whatever retort he was about to throw back died in his throat. She spoke with such melancholy, while sounding nonchalant all the same. Ryoji took several deep breaths. As far as he knew, Shikinami had never had an even remotely normal life. She had been a soldier from the first moment, like Viko's brother, most likely to die in battle like the man had.  
他原本要反驳的话卡在了喉咙里。她的话语中带着淡淡的忧郁，同时又显得漫不经心。綾人深吸了几口气。据他所知，式波从未有过哪怕片刻的正常生活。她从一开始就是一名战士，就像 Viko 的哥哥一样，很可能像那个人一样战死沙场。

"I just… wanted to help," he confessed at last. His shoulders slumped. "Shinji keeps telling himself that every day, every time I see him. Poor guy's been through so much and still he tries to help."  
"我只是……想帮忙，"他最终坦白道。他的肩膀垂了下来。"真嗣每天都在对自己说这句话，每次我见到他都是如此。可怜的家伙经历了那么多，却依然努力想要帮助别人。"

"That's a rather new development," Shikinami countered with another shrug. He caught a frown occupying her features, as though the recollection was particularly bitter. "Not too long ago he was rotting away in a corner, not eating. Your tree-hugging friend gave him a good pep talk, though."  
"那可是个新变化，" 式波不以为意地反驳道。他注意到她的眉头紧锁，仿佛这段回忆格外苦涩。"不久前他还蜷缩在角落里，不吃不喝。你那位热爱自然的友人倒是给了他一番鼓舞。"

Throwing himself on the grass a few meters away from her, Ryoji groaned. "Yeah, he's good at those. So what, I stay here and look after the trees, work over at the pillars, get myself a family and kids and die of old age? Sounds boring."  
凛子在离她几米远的草地上躺下，呻吟道："是啊，他擅长这个。那又怎样，我留在这里照看树木，在柱子旁工作，成家立业，老死一生？听起来真无聊。"

"To you, maybe," said Shikinami. A sidelong glance allowed Ryoji to glimpse at the exhaustion in her gaze. "Learn to appreciate it, if you can. Don't try to do heroic crap like your parents." She stood, picked up a lime laying next to her foot, and threw it at boy's chest. "Just make sure you look after the idiot when I'm gone. He can be very feeble."  
"对你来说或许是吧，" 式波说道。她侧目一瞥，让凛子得以窥见她眼中的疲惫。"试着去欣赏它，如果你能的话。别像你父母那样做英雄主义的蠢事。" 她站起身，捡起脚边的一颗青柠，朝男孩的胸口扔去。"只要确保我离开后照顾好那个傻瓜。他有时很脆弱。"

He sat up in shock after recovering the stray fruit and storing it in his bag. "After you're gone? Take care of which idiot? There's a lot of them in this village! Hey, don't just walk away from me!" he half-yelled with a lazy smile. For some reason, the woman did not seem as annoying anymore. "What do you mean heroic like my parents? Are you telling me my mom is a hero or something?"  
他惊坐起身，将那颗失落的水果收入包中。“你走后？照顾哪个傻瓜？村里可有不少呢！嘿，别就这么走开啊！”他半是嚷嚷地笑着说。不知为何，那女人似乎不再那么惹人烦了。“你说的像我父母那样的英雄是什么意思？你是说我妈是个英雄之类的吗？”

"There's only one idiot in this village I keep tabs on. He's a… prisoner." Shikinami revealed, not stopping. "I'll be gone very soon. Someone has to make sure he doesn't wither away. Up for the task?"  
“村里我只关注一个傻瓜。他是个……囚犯。”式波透露道，并未停下脚步。“我很快就会离开。得有人确保他不会枯萎。你愿意接下这个任务吗？”

"Where the hell are you goi-oh." The implication sunk in; she was going to war, and keeping him out of it. Keeping both him _and_ Shinji out of it. "You mean he's gonna be allowed to stay here?"  
“你到底要去哪——哦。”含义渐渐明了；她即将奔赴战场，而让他远离。让两人都远离。“你是说他会被允许留在这里？”

Shikinami shrugged, and stopped where the trail to Kensuke's house began. "I'm considering it. Depends on him, really. Whatever the idiot wants to do. Pfft, only he gets to break the world and still get to choose whether or not to live in it."  
式波耸了耸肩，停在通往健介家的那条小径前。“我在考虑。主要看他怎么决定。随便那傻瓜想干什么。哼，只有他能打破世界，还能选择是否生活在其中。”

The moon began to reflect in the stream, its reds much darker than the mane of hair Ryoji saw scramble away every other day by the ocean. Once, being much younger and foolish, he had complained to his guardian about the limited space in the village, their strenuous living conditions, and the constant whispers and insults revolving around a 'Shinji Ikari', some of which he had repeated. It had been the only time the blonde had gotten angry with him.  
月亮开始映照在溪流中，其红色比理看见每天在海边匆匆逃走的那个人的头发还要深。曾经，他年幼无知，向他的监护人抱怨村庄空间有限，生活条件艰苦，以及围绕着“真嗣”这个名字的持续低语和侮辱，其中一些他重复了。那是金发男子唯一一次对他发火。

"Viko says that whatever happened, didn't happen exclusively because of Shinji, and that blaming him is stupid," he recited from memory. "And recently, he told me Shinji was trying to… set things right? Oh, and that he was used by his father like a tool for his weird world domination scheme. So really, it's all that Gendo Ikari's fault. Even my mom leaving me here is because of that bastard."  
“维克说，无论发生了什么，都不是仅仅因为真嗣，把责任全推给他是愚蠢的，”他凭记忆复述道。“最近，他还告诉我真嗣正试图……纠正错误？哦，还有他被他父亲当作实现他那奇怪的世界统治计划的工具。所以实际上，这都是源堂的错。甚至我妈妈把我留在这里也是因为那个混蛋。”

"Then how come you don't hate Shinji for it?"  
"那你怎么不因此恨真嗣呢？"

"Huh? That'd be very dumb," Ryoji replied and looked up at the sky. Night had arrived quicker than expected; if he delayed any more his guardian was sure to worry. "Shinji's not his father any more than I'm my mother or my father. We may look and even act alike, but we're different people. I think you know that, keeping an eye on him all the time like you do." A wolfish grin drew on his face. "You like him or something?"  
"哈？那样做很蠢吧，""凌司回答，抬头望向天空。夜晚比预期来得更快；如果再耽搁下去，他的监护人肯定会担心。""真嗣不是他父亲，就像我不是我母亲或父亲一样。我们可能看起来甚至行为相似，但我们是不同的人。我想你知道这一点，像你这样一直盯着他看。""他脸上露出了狼一般的笑容。""你是不是喜欢他？"

"What are you, stupid?" she asked, walking off. "He's a brat."  
"你是不是傻？""她边说边走开了。""他是个小鬼。"

Ryoji stared at her back for a while, then pressed play on his music device and collected a few ripe pears from the trees. "Oh?" he said once certain she was out of earshot. "And you're _not_ a brat? Give me a break, Major Shikinami."  
Ryoji 盯着她的背影看了一会儿，然后按下音乐播放器，从树上摘了几个成熟的梨。“哦？”他确定她听不见后说道，“你不是个小鬼吗？饶了我吧，式波少校。”

Regardless of the many warnings, threats and advice against it, his mind was made up. The next time the Wunder landed he would embark on it, and get to know his mother at last. If Shinji was trying, after all, what excuse did he have not to?  
尽管有诸多警告、威胁和劝告，他的决心已定。下次 Wunder 号降落时，他就要登上它，终于去了解他的母亲。既然真嗣都在尝试，他还有什么理由不去呢？

Metal seared through the wood as the ax split the log in two.  
斧头劈开木头，金属在木头上烧穿而过。

"That's great work!" Hikari remarked with a smile as she played with Tsubame. "Don't overdo it, though. You gave us a good scare some days ago, you know."  
"干得漂亮！" 光笑着对燕说道，"不过别太拼了，前几天你可把我们吓得不轻。"

Shinji collected the pieces of firewood and carried them over to the pyre. The amount of times the phrase 'don't overdo it' had been said to him lately was starting to grate on his nerves. An itch burned somewhere in his mind he couldn't scratch away, a bizarre annoyance akin to the anger that initially grew with the smiles from the villagers.  
真嗣收集起柴火，搬到篝火旁。最近频繁听到'别太拼了'这句话，让他开始感到烦躁。心中有种难以言喻的恼怒，就像最初从村民们笑容中感受到的愤怒一样，无法摆脱。

"I'm sorry," he recited. "I didn't think I'd pass out. Just wanted to make sure R-uhm… that Mrs. Lookalike and the workers had enough firewood. They work hard in the field all morning long." He placed the next log and sliced through it with a grunt. "It was a dumb thing to do."  
"对不起，" 他重复道，"我没想到会晕倒。只是想确保 R……呃……那位长得像的人和工人们有足够的柴火。他们整个上午都在田里辛苦劳作。" 他放上另一根木头，用力劈开，"我真是做了件蠢事。"

"Well, maybe not dumb, but certainly not responsible considering you were still recovering." Hikari smiled at her baby's attempts to wrestle a pear from her hand. She wore a slightly mischievous smirk, feeling Shinji's discomfort from the moment he had arrived. "How's the hand, by the way? Toji was worried it would get infected again with all the work you've been doing."  
"嗯，也许不算笨，但考虑到你还在恢复期，确实不太负责任。" 光微笑着看她的小宝贝试图从她手中抢走梨子。她带着一丝调皮的笑意，从真嗣到达的那一刻起就感受到了他的不适。"顺便问一下，你的手怎么样了？真治担心你做了这么多工作，会再次感染。"

Yet another log was cut and added to the pile. Shinji spared a glance at the scar before picking up the ax. "It's fine, thank you for asking. Hasn't bothered me in a few days, actually." Asuka had been the last to clean and dress it, and for once had not been brutal with the gauze pads. "I forget it's even there sometimes."  
又一截木头被砍下并堆到了柴堆上。真嗣瞥了一眼伤疤，然后拿起斧头。"没事，谢谢关心。实际上这几天都没怎么困扰我。" 明日香是最后一个为他清洁和包扎伤口的人，这次她没有粗暴地对待纱布垫。"有时候我都忘了它的存在。"

"Awesome!" Hikari commented. Tsubame began to yawn after getting bored of trying to reach the fruit to no avail. "Toji will certainly feel proud of his handiwork!" She watched Shinji throw hesitant glances at her every few moments. "Say, Shinji... Kensuke mentioned Asuka eating more often lately. That's _also_ amazing news. Seems like you really are a young culinary master."  
"太棒了！" 光赞叹道。燕因为始终无法够到水果而开始打哈欠。"真治肯定会为他自己的手艺感到骄傲的！" 她注意到真嗣每隔一会儿就犹豫地瞥她一眼。"对了，真嗣... 健介提到明日香最近吃得比较多。这也是个好消息。看来你真是个年轻的烹饪大师呢。"

Knowing the reason behind Asuka's lack of appetite had not much helped matters anymore than the conversation had. Shinji felt hopeful and at the same time terrified. A simple question could shatter whatever strange emotion began to sizzle through his veins after fourteen years.  
得知明日香食欲不振的原因，并没有比那场对话更能改善情况。真嗣既感到充满希望，又同时感到恐惧。一个简单的问题就能打破这十四年来在他血管中悄然沸腾的奇异情感。

"Not really," he remarked, glancing at the pile. His arms and back were starting to burn, but luckily only four logs remained. "Guess I had a lot of time to try out stuff when I lived with my teacher. Now, with everyone going through the trouble of bringing stuff to the kitchen, I try to not make their hard work go to waste. It's the least I can do."  
“不太算吧，”他瞥了一眼那堆木头说道。他的手臂和背部开始感到灼热，但幸运的是只剩下四根木头了。“我猜我在和老师一起生活时有很多时间尝试各种事情。现在，大家都费心把东西搬到厨房，我尽量不让他们辛苦白费。这是我至少能做的。”

_The least you can do, huh,_ Hikari mused, smile widening. _It's nice. This is nice. Seeing him not be so gloomy, seeing him squirm as he tries to not blurt out the question. Acting like he's not_ _**dying**_ _to know. Heh, I think hearing that from Kensuke might have made the gears in his head start moving in a direction that doesn't involve his endless guilt complex. He's worried about teenage stuff for once._  
你至少能做的，是吧，光心里想着，笑容更甚。这样很好。看到他不再那么阴郁，看到他努力不把问题脱口而出时的窘态。装作他并不急于知道。嘿，我想如果这话是健介说的，可能会让他脑子里的齿轮开始朝着不再纠结于无尽的罪恶感的方向转动。他终于开始担心一些青少年的烦恼了。

"You're doing plenty, helping my father with this firewood issue. Viko's normally happy to come and do it, but he's been running all over the village collecting seeds for the next time the Wunder lands." With Tsubame snoring lightly in her arms, Hikari saw the perfect opportunity to nudge a bit more. "Kensuke's also been bouncing all over the place, trying to make everything look as tidy as it can be."  
"“你已经帮了不少忙，帮我父亲处理这些柴火问题。Viko 通常很乐意来帮忙，但他最近一直在村子里到处跑，收集种子为下一次 Wunder 降临做准备。”抱着轻声打鼾的燕子，光觉得这是个再探究竟的好机会。“健介也一直在四处奔波，努力让一切看起来尽可能整洁。””

Shinji almost tripped over at the mention of their village leader. While in Kensuke's presence he acted as closed off as he did with everyone else. She noticed a new discomfort arise in him. Not anger nor envy; something more like apprehension reflected in his gaze.  
提到村长时，真嗣差点绊了一跤。在健介面前，他表现得和其他人一样封闭。她注意到他身上出现了一种新的不适感。不是愤怒也不是嫉妒；更像是一种忧虑，从他的眼神中反映出来。

The last two pieces were split and stored. Hikari noticed how clumsily Shinji covered the firewood from rain, how he stared at the ground, the forest and then back at her in quick succession. _Hmm, seems like a bit more poking is required. Very well then, Mr. Ikari. Have it your way._  
最后两块柴火被劈开并存放好。光注意到真嗣笨拙地用防水布盖住柴火，他快速地盯着地面、森林，然后又看向她。嗯，看来还需要再试探一下。好吧，碇同学，就按你的方式来。

"It's weird," she spoke with a soft, almost disinterested voice. "The very few times Asuka's been here, she never leaves that old train station unless it's absolutely necessary. It was quite the shock for a lot of us to see her the other night."  
“很奇怪，”她用一种轻柔、几乎漠不关心的声音说道，“阿斯卡来这里的次数屈指可数，除非绝对必要，否则她从不离开那个旧火车站。那晚看到她，对我们很多人来说都是个大惊喜。”

Hikari struggled to suppress a giggle when Shinji's head perked up. "Really?" he asked. "So does she… I mean when she comes to the village. Uhm… does she always stay with Kensuke?"  
当真嗣的头突然抬起时，光子努力忍住不笑出声来。“真的吗？”他问道，“那她……我是说，她来村子的时候。呃……她总是和健介在一起吗？”

_Ha! That wasn't so hard, was it? Finally, some progress_ _**and**_ _potentially delicious gossip material._ "Yeah, pretty much. We didn't see her for a couple of years, back before the village was what it is right now, and when we finally met again… a lot had happened. Things weren't the same, even if her aspect hadn't changed a bit."  
哈！这也没那么难，对吧？终于有了一些进展，还可能是美味的八卦素材。“是啊，差不多。我们有几年没见到她了，那时候村子还不是现在这样，当我们终于再次见面时……发生了很多事。一切都不一样了，尽管她的外表一点都没变。”

So close. Hikari could feel the question coming, and the anticipation was too much. Something as pleasing to witness as the rekindling bond of those two was too good a thing not to enjoy. And if she could help in the slightest of ways, why not?  
如此接近。光能感觉到问题即将到来，那种期待感太过强烈。像那两人重新燃起的羁绊一样令人愉悦的场景，实在是难得一见的美好，怎能不享受呢？如果她能在最微小的方面提供帮助，何乐而不为呢？

"So, Hor-" “那么，霍——”

"Hikari's fine, Shinji. No need for honorifics between friends. And I know you're dying to ask me something, so go ahead. My lips are sealed, if that's what you're worried about."  
“光就好，真嗣。朋友之间不需要敬语。我知道你很想问我什么，尽管问吧。如果担心我会泄露，放心，我的嘴可是很严的。”

"Right, so..." Shinji looked at the ground as he pretended to inspect the ax's edge. "Do you know if Asuka and Kensuke are like… uhm… what I meant to say is… I…"  
“好吧，那么……” 真嗣低头看着地面，假装检查斧头的刃口。“你知道明日香和健介是不是……呃……我的意思是……我……”

A few chuckles escaped her. The indecisiveness and trepidation Shinji displayed was simply too endearing, and a welcoming contrast to his earlier visits. "You mean to ask what the nature of their relationship is? Nod for yes." Color rose to the boy's face; his head moved up and down as he focused on the grass underneath his feet. "As suspected. How about we walk back to the house? I'd love a little help in the kitchen. Father just got us some lovely fresh tuna from Village 1 again, I'll be sure to put some away for you."  
她忍不住轻笑了几声。真嗣的犹豫和紧张显得格外可爱，与他之前的来访形成了鲜明的对比。“你是想问他们关系的性质吗？点头表示是。”男孩的脸颊泛起了红晕；他低头盯着脚下的草地，轻轻地点了点头。“果然如此。我们边走边聊，回屋里去吧？我正好需要厨房里的一点帮助。父亲刚从第一村带回了新鲜的金枪鱼，我会为你留一些的。”

Shinji was quick to trot back to her side. "You don't need to do that, Hikari." His eyes drifted to Tsubame, drawing a small smile. "She's all tuckered out, huh?"  
真嗣迅速小跑回到她身边。“你不必这么做的，光。”他的目光飘向燕，露出一丝微笑。“她看起来累坏了，是吧？”

"She failed in her mission to get this, got bored and went to sleep," she said, and produced the pear. She handed it to him. "Here. You've been working hard all afternoon. It's ripe, Ryoji came by this morning to deliver some."  
"她没能完成任务拿到这个，觉得无聊就去睡了，" 她说着，拿出了那个梨。她递给他。"给。你整个下午都在辛苦工作。这个熟了，今天早上六道来送了一些。"

"Thank you," Shinji answered, taking the offered payment and biting into it with gusto. "Wow, these are really sweet."  
"谢谢，" 真嗣回答，接过递来的梨，津津有味地咬了一口。"哇，这些真的很甜。"

"Oh yes they are. Wait until you try the apples. Now then." Hikari leaned in and snickered. "Are we feeling a bit jealous of our dear Major Shikinami's pet name for Kensuke?"  
"哦，确实很甜。等你尝尝苹果就知道了。那么。" 光靠过来，窃笑着说。"我们是不是有点嫉妒我们亲爱的式波少校给健介起的昵称呢？"

"What? No!" Shinji almost choked on a mouthful of pear. "They… seem to be very comfortable around each other, a-and Asuka has this habit of…" His face grew redder still. "I just feel like they're close, and I was a bit curious about that."  
"什么？不！" 真嗣差点被一口梨呛到。"他们……似乎相处得很自在，而且明日香有这个习惯……" 他的脸变得更红了。"我只是觉得他们关系很亲密，所以有点好奇。"

_Because a certain someone wants to be a little closer to our dear, elusive little major, Shinji? Hmm? Finally! Fourteen years in the making, jeez.  
因为某个特别的人想和我们那位难以捉摸的小少校更亲近一点，对吧，真嗣？嗯？终于！十四年的等待，真是的。_

"To me, it's just a convenient arrangement." Hikari was sure to watch Shinji's every reaction to her words. "She didn't feel like speaking to anyone, and I think that fact remains to this day. Getting Asuka to sit and speak her mind is as rare to see as say… an Aurora Borealis."  
"对我来说，这只是个方便的安排。" 光子仔细观察着真嗣对她的话的每一个反应。"她当时不想和任何人说话，我想这个事实至今依然存在。要让明日香坐下来吐露心声，就像看到……比如说……北极光一样罕见。"

Her smirk only widened at the way Shinji stumbled and almost dropped the ax. "I-It is?" he asked in shock. "Like when we were going to school together?"  
看到真嗣踉跄着差点把斧头掉在地上，她的讥笑更甚。“我-我是吗？”他震惊地问，“就像我们以前一起上学时那样？”

"I'd say it's worse than back then. What happened, you know-" Hikari pointed at her eye, "-that closed her off even worse. Since Kensuke was always too busy helping his dad out, he never really bothered to ask her about what happened. Because of that, Asuka felt comfortable around him, I suppose." Hikari paused to ensure Shinji's attention was solely focused on her words. "They're like brothers, or a son with his daughter in recent years."  
“我觉得比那时候更糟。你知道发生了什么——” 光指向自己的眼睛，“——那件事让她更加封闭自己。因为真希当时总是忙于帮她爸爸，从未真正费心去问她发生了什么。正因为如此，明日香觉得在他身边很自在，我想。”光停顿了一下，确保真嗣的注意力完全集中在她的话上。“他们就像兄妹，或者近年来的父女关系。”

The gentle caress of overgrown grass nipped at her ankles. Shinji's stride and posture strengthened at her remark. The scenario unfolded as expected.  
长高的草轻轻拂过她的脚踝。听到她的评论，真嗣的步伐和姿态都变得坚定起来。一切如预期般展开。

"Oh… like brothers?" Hikari's smirk only broadened with the way Shinji's voice strained with relief. "Son and daughter? Ah… But was there something…uhm," he mumbled more to himself than her. She realized his gaze drifted to the healing gash on his wrist. "It sounds like they've… known each other for a while."  
"哦……像兄弟一样？" 光看到真嗣的声音因松了一口气而紧绷，她的笑意更浓了。"儿子和女儿？啊……但是不是有什么……呃，" 他喃喃自语，更像是对自己说的。她注意到他的目光飘向了他手腕上正在愈合的伤口。"听起来他们……已经认识一段时间了。"

_Aw, you poor thing,_ Hikari thought, glancing over to the houses. _You think you've already lost the war, when there's not even a single battle to fight._ "Yeah, certainly. We've all known her for quite a few years, but…" She shook her head with a small smile. "Asuka's never bothered to eat any food I've ever sent, nor does she take kindly to Kensuke trying to cook. The brave major calls it a wasteof resources. She doesn't talk to any of us, not even Kensuke."  
哎，可怜的家伙，光心想，瞥了一眼那些房子。你以为你已经输掉了战争，而实际上连一场战斗都还没开始。"是啊，当然。我们都认识她好几年了，但是……" 她摇摇头，微微一笑。"明日香从来不吃我送的任何食物，也不喜欢健介尝试做饭。这位勇敢的大小姐称之为浪费资源。她不和我们任何人说话，甚至连健介也不例外。"

"Oh, but-" Shinji tripped on a root, almost falling flat on his face. "They're so… familiar with each other. I thought there was something there."  
"哦，但是——" 真嗣被一根树根绊了一下，差点脸朝下摔倒。"他们彼此之间太熟悉了。我以为他们之间有什么。"

"Yeah, a lot of caring on both sides, I'll give you that," Shinji flinched at the statement. _It's fine, Shinji. It really is. You don't need to worry about any of it._ "Maybe Asuka even tried something some years ago, but it never went anywhere." She walked in front of him and brought both to a stop a few feet away from the Suzuhara household.  
"是啊，双方都很关心，这点我承认，" 真嗣听到这话时缩了一下。没事的，真嗣。真的没事。你不必担心这些。"也许几年前明日香也尝试过什么，但什么也没发生。"她走到他前面，两人在铃原家几英尺外停了下来。

"Her heart wasn't in it," Hikari revealed, and tapped at Shinji's arm. "He's been there for her, as a friend, for a long time. They have a mutual understanding at best, and nothing more. Kensuke's probably the only person she feels comfortable with." The same mischievous smile from her youth returned. "That is, until you came back in the picture."  
"她的心不在那儿，" 光子透露道，并轻拍了一下真嗣的手臂。"他作为朋友陪伴她很久了。他们最多只有一种相互理解，仅此而已。可能只有健介是她觉得舒服的人。"她年轻时的那种调皮笑容又回来了。"也就是说，直到你再次出现。"

"Huh? Me?" Shinji's gaze drifted away from the house and into the forest, avoiding her eyes at all cost. It was painful to see how much he had deluded himself into believing the battle had been lost before it began. "Asuka hates me."  
"啊？我吗？" 真嗣的目光从房子移向森林，竭力避开她的眼睛。看到他如此自欺欺人地相信战斗还没开始就已失败，真是令人心痛。"明日香讨厌我。"

"Are you gonna keep telling yourself that over and over again until you believe it?" Hikari countered easily. Her fingers brushed on Shinji's chin. Their eyes met for the briefest second. "Asuka doesn't hate you. She even came to the village to pick you up and put that nice little cap on you the moment you climbed into the car." His cheeks colored again. _Oh, so the little cap means something to you, does it?_ "She's very fond of those roundels, at least that's what Kensuke says. Never lets him touch them at all. And yet she put that cap on your head without a moment's hesitation."  
"你打算一遍又一遍地告诉自己这些，直到你相信为止吗？" 光轻松地反驳道。她的手指轻拂过真嗣的下巴。他们的目光短暂交汇。"明日香并不讨厌你。她甚至来到村子接你，一上车就给你戴上了那顶可爱的小帽子。" 他的脸颊再次泛红。哦，那顶小帽子对你意义重大，是吗？"她非常喜欢那些徽章，至少健介是这么说的。从不让他碰一下。然而她却毫不犹豫地把那顶帽子戴在了你头上。"

Shinji almost fled from her touch, and despite the baby rousing at her rough movement, Hikari trapped his shoulder and kept him in place. "What does the cap have anything to do with her and Kensuke?" he asked her, almost pleading.  
真嗣几乎要从她的触碰中逃开，尽管婴儿因她的粗鲁动作而哭闹，光还是抓住了他的肩膀，让他留在原地。"那顶帽子和她与健介有什么关系？" 他几乎是在恳求地问她。

"Everything." Hikari gave him a gentle, encouraging expression. "You've heard this before, from my idiot's husband's mouth, probably from my father and Kensuke himself." Tsubame let out a loud cry, demanding food. "Asuka's never given anybody _anything_. Not a thing, not so much as a glass of water. Who do you suppose finds those batteries for you?"  
"一切。" 光给了他一个温柔鼓励的表情。"你以前可能从我那笨蛋丈夫的嘴里，或者我父亲和健介那里听说过。" 燕子发出响亮的哭声，要求喂食。"明日香从未给过任何人任何东西。连一杯水都没有。你认为是谁为你找到那些电池的？"

Warmth spread all over her being when Shinji's hand flew to his pocket, where the small black box normally traveled. "They uhh… they're suddenly there, on top of the blankets every couple of days. I thought it was Kensuke who left them ther-"  
当真嗣的手迅速伸向口袋，那里通常装着那个小黑盒子时，她全身都洋溢着温暖。“它们呃……每隔几天就会突然出现在毯子上面。我以为是健介把它们放在那里的——”

"Our great commander does many things, but definitely has little time in his busy day to find those specific batteries all the time," Hikari elaborated. "With all the spare time Asuka's got and Kensuke's enthusiasm with electronics, it can't be that hard to come across those."  
“我们伟大的指挥官做了很多事，但肯定没有那么多时间在他繁忙的日子里总是找到那些特定的电池，”光解释道。“以明日香拥有的空闲时间和健介对电子产品的热情，找到那些电池并不难。”

"You mean it's _her?"_ Shinji managed to say once they got to the house. Hikari set the baby in her crib and started handing him fresh ingredients to slice. Bunzaemon voiced out his hunger from the kitchen. "And it really is just like a… parental thing?"  
“你是说，是她？”他们到达房子后，真嗣勉强说道。光把婴儿放在婴儿床里，开始递给他新鲜的食材切片。文左卫门从厨房里喊着饿了。“这真的就像是一种……父母般的行为吗？”

"It most certainly is." The temptation to ask was just too strong. "You're very interested in this," she remarked while heating up water for their stew. "Do you like our dear major or something?"  
"这当然是。" 询问的诱惑实在太强烈了。"你对此很感兴趣啊，" 她一边加热水准备炖汤一边说道。"你是不是喜欢我们亲爱的少校什么的？"

"N-No!" The high pitched tone of Shinji's voice worked better than any explanation he might have come up with. "Asuka's already older than I am, like you." His gaze drifted over to the cradle. "Whatever was there, if there ever was something, is long gone." She heard the knife he was working with slice clean through the apple. "I'm too late. Useless, like always. I tried what you said. Tried to cook for her."  
"不——不是！" 真嗣的声音高亢，比任何解释都更有说服力。"明日香已经比我大了，就像你一样。" 他的目光飘向摇篮。"无论曾经有什么，如果真的有过，也早已消失无踪。" 她听到他手中的刀干净利落地切过苹果。"我来得太晚。一如既往地无用。我试了你说的，试着为她做饭。"

"First of all," said Hikari, index finger held high. "Asuka's _not_ older than you. She may say otherwise, but in here?" She tapped her temple. "She's fourteen still. She's been eating lately, more than ever before, _and_ she came to the village center." No visible reaction came from Shinji. _Maybe it's time to be a bit more direct_. "Second, I don't recall her ever telling Kenken he's an idiot, if that means anything. You just need a little courage, is all."  
"首先，" 光子竖起食指说。"明日香并不比你大。她或许会这么说，但在这里？" 她敲了敲自己的太阳穴。"她仍然是十四岁。她最近吃得比以前多，还去了村中心。" 真嗣没有任何明显的反应。也许该更直接一点。"其次，我不记得她曾对健健说过他是白痴，如果这有什么意义的话。你只需要一点勇气，仅此而已。"

"Right," Shinji said sourly. "What does that word even mean?"  
"Right," 真嗣酸溜溜地说。 "这个词到底是什么意思？"

She offered no response, but the hesitant smile Shinji displayed while cooking was more than enough to let her know he understood. There was still hope left in this world. The small victory of helping the boy realize where he stood was sweeter than any of Viko's treasured caramels.  
她没有回应，但真嗣在做饭时露出的迟疑微笑足以让她明白他懂了。这个世界仍有希望。帮助这个男孩意识到自己的立场，这种小小的胜利比维科珍藏的任何焦糖都要甜美。

Once the food was boiling, she recalled the mention their village leader had made of a certain book laying around his house. "Courage," she announced, smiling. "To possess strength in the face of pain or grief."  
食物开始沸腾时，她回想起村长曾提到他家里有一本特定的书。 "勇气，" 她宣布道，微笑着。 "在面对痛苦或悲伤时拥有力量。"

"_You like him or something?"_  
"你喜欢他还是怎么的？"

"Shut up. It's been fourteen years. I'm basically twice his age, even if I don't look the part. Stupid brat."  
"闭嘴。已经十四年了。我基本上是他的两倍年龄，即使看起来不像。这愚蠢的小子。"

Her fingers punched the buttons without reprieve while the morning sun illuminated the old station little by little. A gust of crisp morning air filtered through the open window, and made her glance at the dark tracksuit drying off a few feet away. Both jackets had needed washing after getting splashed with mud the day Shinji had collapsed. The cold air made her shudder.  
她的手指不停地按着按钮，清晨的阳光一点点照亮了老旧的车站。一阵清新的晨风从敞开的窗户吹进来，让她瞥了一眼几英尺外正在晾干的深色运动服。两件夹克都得洗了，因为昨天真嗣晕倒时溅上了泥。冷空气让她打了个寒颤。

"What a great freaking curse this is," she said to the empty space and the unwanted, quiet companion dozing off within her eye. "You get to live rent-free in my body, deprive me of food or rest, and you don't do a thing about say… pain or cold. What a great parasite you are."  
"“这该死的诅咒真是绝了，”她对着空荡荡的空间和那个不请自来、在她眼中打盹的安静伙伴说道，“你免费住在我的身体里，剥夺我的食物和休息，却对疼痛或寒冷毫无作为。你真是个了不起的寄生虫。”

After decimating another level, the cold became too much for her bare skin to tolerate. Her jacket was still soaking wet, having been the last thing the idiot had laundered, so her options were Kensuke's itchy coat, the red sweater the idiot was suddenly so fond of, or the stupid tracksuit top. She walked over to Shinji's blankets, resolute on taking back her garment, but stopped in her tracks when the cap came into view. The last time she had seen it, it had been on the brat's head as an extra precaution.  
"在摧毁了又一个层面后，寒冷变得让她裸露的皮肤难以忍受。她的夹克还是湿漉漉的，因为那是那个白痴最后洗的东西，所以她的选择只有健介那件刺痒的外套、那个白痴突然钟爱的红色毛衣，或是那件愚蠢的运动服上衣。她走到真嗣的毯子旁，决心要回自己的衣服，但当那顶帽子映入眼帘时，她停下了脚步。上次见到它时，它还戴在那小鬼的头上，作为额外的防护。”

It sat atop the book and jacket, neatly arranged, with dim light reflecting on the surface of the roundels. Shinji was so pathetically careful when folding and ordering his little corner. It was reassuring in some way; he was aware enough not to fall into the old patterns. Why did she not want to interfere with her own clothing?  
"它整齐地摆放在书和夹克上，微弱的灯光在圆形徽章的表面反射。真嗣在折叠和整理他的小角落时，真是可怜地小心翼翼。这在某种程度上让人安心；他足够清醒，不会陷入旧有的模式。为什么她不想干涉自己的衣物呢？”

"Ugh, this is so freaking dumb." Asuka huffed and shook her head, grabbed the dark jacket instead and zipped it close all the way to her neck. She leaned against the wall, eye narrowing at the black box sitting next to her cap. "Fine. He gets to keep the stupid jacket. I was the one who said I didn't want it anymore. Let him have it."  
"哼，真是蠢透了。" 明日香嘟囔着，摇了摇头，抓起那件深色夹克，一直拉到脖子处拉好拉链。她靠在墙上，眯起眼睛盯着放在她帽子旁边的黑色盒子。"好吧。他可以留着这件蠢夹克。是我自己说不再想要它的。就让他留着吧。"

She picked the SDAT from it's perch atop the dictionary, feet moving towards the window. Shinji would be taking a while today as well. With his health improving, he was able to further assist in various tasks. He would rise earlier than Kensuke, make breakfast, leave her a bento, and go straight to the ration center to prepare meals for the workers. After the morning shift was done he'd go to the ruins and fish for a few hours, and either look after the seedlings or help in the Suzuhara household until the sun went down.  
她从字典顶上取下 SDAT，脚步向窗户移动。今天真嗣也会花不少时间。随着健康状况的改善，他能够协助完成更多任务。他比健介起得早，做早餐，给她留下便当，然后直接去配给中心为工人们准备饭菜。早班结束后，他会去废墟钓鱼几个小时，要么照看幼苗，要么在铃原家帮忙，直到太阳下山。

"Let's see what the brat has on this stupid device." Asuka pressed rewind with a strange sense of apprehension. "Boring crap from decades ago, I'm sure."  
"看看这小鬼在这破设备上存了些什么。" 明日香带着一种莫名的紧张感按下了倒带键。"肯定是几十年前的无聊玩意儿，我敢肯定。"

Years of caring for her WonderSwan had taught her how to handle old technology, yet Asuka manipulated the music player as though it was already broken and prone to disintegrate into tiny pieces at the slightest misstep. Some odd feeling came over her once the buds were placed in her ears, a rare sensation of familiarity.  
多年来照顾她的 WonderSwan 让她学会了如何处理旧技术，然而明日香操作着音乐播放器，仿佛它已经损坏，稍有不慎就会碎成无数碎片。当耳机塞入耳中时，一种奇异的熟悉感涌上心头，这是一种罕见的感受。

_Freaking thing's been there almost staring at me. It's boring just sitting in this place all damn day playing video games. I don't even care if the stupid music is good or not, I just need_ _**something**_ _to occupy my mind with. Yeah. That's all it is._  
那该死的东西几乎一直盯着我。整天坐在这个地方玩电子游戏真是无聊透顶。我甚至不在乎那愚蠢的音乐好不好听，我只是需要点什么来占据我的思绪。没错，就是这样。

Rewind. Stop. Play. 倒带。停止。播放。

The first tunes were indeed some old Japanese pop classics, with most of the following songs being classical pieces. Asuka sat by the blankets and allowed the songs to lull her senses, they carried her to snowy mountains, gray tracking fields, solitary changing rooms. Nostalgic, painful, but reassuring.  
起初的几首确实是一些老日本流行经典，接下来的大部分歌曲则是古典乐章。明日香坐在毯子旁，任由这些旋律抚慰她的感官，它们将她带到了雪域高山、灰色的追踪场地、孤独的更衣室。怀旧、痛苦，却又令人安心。

Some lonesome piano and cello tunes followed, each more melancholic than the last. The scent of pine and fresh grass was imprinted on the idiot's jacket, which along with the songs carried her mind to the clearing, and the night she had pushed food bars into his mouth. Her eyes drifted to the dictionary. Every day a new word would be marked, every day the translation of the song carried further down the page.  
随后是一些孤独的钢琴和大提琴曲调，一首比一首更忧郁。松树和新鲜草地的香气印刻在那傻瓜的夹克上，伴随着这些歌曲，她的思绪飘向了那片空地，以及那个夜晚她将能量棒塞进他嘴里的情景。她的目光飘向了那本词典。每天都会标记一个新单词，每天歌曲的翻译都会在页面上继续延伸。

Every day the bentos were more intricate, the taste more discernible and unique.  
每天的便当都更加精致，味道也更加细腻独特。

The coming of noon saw her still sitting next to the idiot's meager belongings, most of which had been hers not too long ago. Lately, she'd catch Shinji stealing glances at either her or the stupid cap. There a little makeshift pyre encircled by small rocks in his sad fishing station, with a small stack of firewood that grew each day. He could hold a conversation lately, and sometimes even smiled.  
正午时分，她依旧坐在那傻瓜的寒酸物品旁，其中大部分不久前还是她的。最近，她注意到真嗣不时偷瞄她或那顶愚蠢的帽子。在他那凄凉的钓鱼点，有一个用小石子围成的小火堆，每天都会增加一小堆柴火。他最近能进行对话了，有时甚至会微笑。

"Still as feeble as ever, though," she whispered. "Always so unreliable."  
“依然如此虚弱，”她低声说，“总是那么不可靠。”

"_Do something already, Baka Shinji!"_  
“快做点什么吧，笨蛋真嗣！”

"Heh." She shook her head and stared at the ceiling. "Well, almost always."  
"呵呵。" 她摇了摇头，盯着天花板。"嗯，几乎总是这样。"

After another hour, the final song began to play, the one he had been listening to and translating. There was nothing overly special about it; if anything it was simple when compared to the more intricate classical pieces. Some parts of it she could somehow relate to; having nothing in life but a single purpose, or a song. Fighting endlessly in a losing battle.  
又过了一个小时，最后一首歌开始播放，那是他一直在听并翻译的那首。这首歌并没有什么特别之处；如果说有什么不同的话，那就是与那些更复杂的古典作品相比，它显得简单。她能从中找到一些共鸣；生活中除了一个单一的目标或一首歌之外一无所有，或是无休止地在一场注定失败的战斗中奋斗。

The bitter taste of loneliness invaded her being just as the song stopped. She rewound the tape and returned the box atop the dictionary and her jacket. Shinji was bound to arrive soon, most likely with a healthy dinner prepared by him and Hikari. Quiet days and warm nights with the senseless banter of both males as they spoke at the table became the norm.  
当歌曲停止时，孤独的苦涩感侵袭了她的全身。她倒带了磁带，将盒子放回字典和她的夹克上。真嗣很快就会到来，很可能会带来他和光精心准备的健康晚餐。安静的日子和温暖的夜晚，伴随着两个男人在餐桌上的无意义闲聊，已成为常态。

For the first time since arriving at the village, her shoulders relaxed. _I suppose this is how an actual vacation feels like. Brat's not trying to die or escape and he's easy enough to predict. Kenken looks happy that he's getting food made by someone else, and not whatever gruel he concocts._ The tunes played back in her mind, easing the battle senses.  
自打来到村子以来，她第一次放松了肩膀。我想这就是真正度假的感觉吧。小鬼不再试图寻死或逃跑，而且他的行为也容易预料。Kenken 看起来很高兴能吃到别人做的饭，而不是他那乱七八糟的粥。那些旋律在脑海中回响，平息了战斗的警觉。

"I've always been alone," she repeated. "If it weren't for that stupid battle, for those days in that dirty, cramped apartment, I wouldn't know anything else. I don't know which is the worse curse. You..." Her hand massaged the area around the eye-patch. "Or him."  
“我一直都是一个人，”她重复道，“如果不是那场愚蠢的战斗，不是在那肮脏狭小的公寓里的那些日子，我根本不会知道其他生活。我不知道哪个诅咒更糟糕。你……”她的手按摩着眼罩周围的区域，“还是他。”

_Can't even count on Four-Eyes to not be late to save her own damn life. And the idiot's more likely to blow us all to hell than to help in any way. Well, whatever. I'm waiting for my own funeral one way or the other.  
连四眼都指望不上，她连自己的命都救不了还迟到。而这个白痴更有可能把我们都炸上天，而不是提供任何帮助。唉，无所谓了。反正我也在等着自己的葬礼。_

Her body moved to the table, as though dragged by some unseen magnetic force. The Major scowled at the bento and the tiny container resting beside it, but Asuka still sat and started to eat, mind drifting to a classroom. Boys ogling her, curt but fun conversations with the former class rep, stolen glimpses at the fool who bothered to cook for her and for the First.  
她的身体不由自主地移向餐桌，仿佛被某种无形的磁力牵引。玛吉尔少校对着便当和旁边的小容器皱起了眉头，但明日香依然坐下开始用餐，思绪飘向了教室。男生们对她垂涎三尺，与前班代表简短却有趣的对话，偷偷瞥向那个傻瓜，他竟费心为她和大和号做饭。

The lemon reduction was much more balanced this time, and went better with the fish filet than it ever would have on top of old and stale protein bars. It was sour like the memory of realizing how Shinji had almost cracked the world in half to save the First, and sweet like the small video trapped on the old cellphone.  
这次柠檬汁调配得更加均衡，与鱼片搭配得比以往任何时候都好，远胜过那些陈旧的蛋白质棒。它的酸味如同意识到真嗣为了救大和号几乎将世界一分为二时的记忆，甜味则像那段被封存在旧手机里的小视频。

Lazy hours, quiet and peaceful, the sound of the wind and gentle rain outside. The taste of the lightly caramelized apple and pear slices in the small tray next to her lunch. A sense of absurd, boring sense of normalcy settled in, one that never manifested when she was aboard the ship or in her entry plug. For so long the only place she belonged had been the blood-smelling tube, it had never occurred to her that life outside of it was possible.  
慵懒的时光，宁静而平和，窗外风声和细雨的轻柔交响。午餐旁小盘里轻微焦糖化的苹果和梨片的味道。一种荒谬却又无聊的正常感油然而生，这种感觉在她身处舰上或驾驶舱时从未出现过。长久以来，她唯一归属的地方就是那充满血腥味的管子，从未想过外面的生活也是可能的。

Certainly a normal life was out of the question for Asuka Langley Shikinami. Small moments shared at the table at night, or watching the idiot fish or talk nonsense with Misato's brat, were the closest she'd get to any of that boring yet endearing normalcy.  
对于式波·明日香·兰格雷来说，过上正常生活显然是不可能的。夜晚在餐桌旁共享的小时刻，或是看着那条傻鱼，与美里家的那个小鬼闲聊，已是她能接近那种既无聊又令人心生暖意的正常生活的最接近方式了。

"Suppose this is better than nothing," she reasoned after the food was gone. Her stomach growled despite her having just eaten. "At least the taste's not as mediocre as before."  
“假设这总比一无所有好，”她在食物吃完后这样想着。尽管刚刚才吃过，她的肚子还是咕咕叫了起来。“至少味道不像以前那么平庸了。”

---

Two days after conversing with Hikari, Shinji finished building his makeshift fireplace.  
在与光子交谈后的两天，真嗣完成了他的临时壁炉搭建。

What initially started as a pyre of wood rounded by a bunch of stones turned into a small cooking station after repeated trial and error. Ryoji had suggested using tadpoles and earthworms as bait, which worked wonders for his daily catches. Still, having charcoaled his first attempt at cooking it there meant no more of the precious food resource could be wasted on his foolish endeavor.  
起初，一堆石头围成的柴堆经过反复试验和错误，变成了一个小型烹饪站。凌司建议用蝌蚪和蚯蚓作为诱饵，这对他每天的捕获量产生了奇效。然而，第一次尝试在那里烹饪却把食物烤焦了，这意味着不能再浪费宝贵的食物资源在他愚蠢的尝试上。

His penguin companions had let their discomfort be known at the smoke that now regularly fled out the walls. They screeched at him as whenever he walked past, and yet every day he was just a bit luckier with the catch.  
他的企鹅伙伴们对现在经常从墙缝中冒出的烟感到不适，每当他走过时，它们都会对他尖叫。然而，每天他的运气都稍微好一些，捕获更多。

After the fourth try he figured out how to keep the cinders burning, and a fifth attempt had him studying how to keep the ashes from flying off with the ocean breeze. The fishing rod was held in place by heavy rocks as he worked on the pet project. Time went by faster when he was busy, so the small moments of reflection as he sat near the water were more precious as his routine filled with more work.  
经过第四次尝试，他弄清楚了如何保持余烬燃烧，而第五次尝试则让他研究如何防止灰烬被海风带走。在他忙于这个宠物项目时，钓鱼竿被沉重的石头固定住。当他忙碌时，时间过得更快，因此坐在水边的小小反思时刻随着日常工作的增多而变得更加珍贵。

"She's been really quiet these past few days," he said to the penguin leader. The bird had made a habit of standing next to him whenever the sun began to set. "Somebody told me the ship's coming in a few weeks. The Wunder or whatever it's called. I've tried to talk to her a few times, and it hasn't worked."  
"她最近几天特别安静，"他对企鹅首领说。每当太阳开始落山，这只鸟都会习惯性地站在他旁边。"有人告诉我，船几周后就会来。叫什么奇迹号之类的。我试着和她聊过几次，但都没成功。"

The bird shook its head and ruffled its feathers.  
那只鸟摇了摇头，抖了抖羽毛。

"I know, I know. It could've gone much worse. At least she didn't yell or get angry either time." A loud squeak of approval rang through the walls. "It was kind of exciting. I didn't know what was going to happen, but then I thought whatever did happen wasn't going to be worse than what's _already_ happened, so… I'm starting to talk in circles, right?" He turned to see the penguin had already started waddling back to its group. "I'll take it as a yes, then."  
"我知道，我知道。情况本可以更糟的。至少她两次都没有大喊大叫或生气。"一声响亮的赞同声在墙壁间回荡。"那种感觉挺刺激的。我不知道会发生什么，但我想，无论发生什么，都不会比已经发生的更糟，所以……我开始绕圈子说话了，对吧？"他转头一看，企鹅已经摇摇摆摆地回到了它的群体中。"那我就当是同意了。"

He caught two small fish, one of which he released back in the water. Working in the mornings, going over to the pillars from time to time, caring for the young trees, visiting the rice fields, cutting and delivering firewood; these were all activities he had never done before and now looked forward to.  
他捉到了两条小鱼，其中一条放回了水中。清晨劳作，不时前往柱子旁，照料幼树，巡视稻田，砍柴送柴；这些活动他从前未曾做过，如今却满心期待。

Somewhere between him collapsing in the village and being 'recruited' to care for the seedlings, the smiles which had angered him were now a welcoming sight. The memory of the Wanderers clashing against the barrier only worked to fuel his desire to make better meals. One tree at a time, one smile at a time.  
在他昏倒在村中与被‘招募’来照料秧苗之间的某个时刻，那些曾令他恼怒的笑容如今成了欢迎的景象。流浪者们冲击屏障的记忆，反倒激发了他做出更美味饭菜的渴望。一棵树接一棵树，一个微笑接一个微笑。

"Never too late," Shinji recalled.  
“永远不会太晚，”真嗣回忆道。

"Late?" "晚了？"

A girl's voice startled him. Soft footsteps approached, barely discernible through the sound of the waves crashing. His eyes drifted to the familiar features of this stranger who followed and gazed at him with fondness. "Hi," he greeted, nodding to the box next to him. "How was work in the fields today?"  
一个女孩的声音吓了他一跳。轻柔的脚步声靠近，几乎被海浪拍打的声音掩盖。他的目光转向这位陌生人的熟悉面容，她跟随并深情地注视着他。“嗨，”他打招呼，点头示意旁边的箱子。“今天田里的工作怎么样？”

"I have now planted forty-three rows of rice, and the bean sprouts are blooming." The girl with Rei's face gingerly took the offered seat, and placed the rations between them. "I am late?"  
“我现在已经种了四十三排水稻，豆芽也开花了。”有着丽面容的女孩小心翼翼地坐下，将口粮放在两人之间。“我迟到了吗？”

"No, not at all." Shinji grabbed one of the bars and bit into it. Stale and dry, but it was food. "Thank you for bringing these. Please tell Hikari and Toji I said thanks."  
"不，一点也不。" 真嗣抓起一根巧克力棒咬了一口。虽然又干又硬，但毕竟是食物。"谢谢你带这些来。请告诉光和东治，我向他们道谢。"

"Understood." He felt her curious gaze fix on his pathetic effort at a decent-looking fireplace. "Are you constructing something?"  
"明白了。" 他感觉到她好奇的目光落在他那可怜兮兮的、试图搭建得像样的火堆上。"你在搭建什么吗？"

Ever since Asuka visited, he had kept the second box next to him in hopes she would return. "Yeah."  
自从明日香来访后，他就一直把第二个箱子放在身边，希望她会回来。"嗯。"

Shinji turned to catch her inspecting every detail of the small pyre. "Is it a… kitchen? Ms. Hikari explained what its purpose was yesterday."  
真嗣转过身，看到她在仔细检查这个小柴堆的每一个细节。“这是个……厨房吗？昨天光小姐解释了它的用途。”

_A kitchen would be nice. I wouldn't have to worry about the food tasting like smoke and ash._ "It's just a little fireplace. Do you like fish? I've been trying some new things."  
有个厨房就太好了。我就不用担心食物吃起来像烟灰了。“这只是个小壁炉。你喜欢鱼吗？我最近在尝试一些新菜。”

"I have enjoyed every single dish you have prepared thus far," she said in that quiet voice he remembered. The words made his face heat up. "I do not like the taste of meat, however."  
“到目前为止，你做的每一道菜我都喜欢，”她用那熟悉的轻柔声音说道。这些话让他的脸颊发烫。“不过，我不太喜欢肉的味道。”

_Figured you'd say that,_ he thought, checked the line and glanced back at the rocks. "One of your work partners said she'll bring me some shiitake mushrooms. I'll try to make something half-decent for you tomorrow."  
他心想，你肯定会这么说，检查了一下钓线，又瞥了一眼岩石。“你的一个工作伙伴说她会给我带些香菇来。我明天尽量给你做点像样的东西。”

He caught the girl's face coloring slightly. Where could Ayanami be? Was she still trapped in Unit 01?  
他注意到女孩的脸微微泛红。绫波在哪里？她还被困在初号机里吗？

"Thank you," she said. "May I ask something?"  
“谢谢你，”她说。“我可以问个问题吗？”

"Sure." "当然。"

"Can you give me a name?"  
"你能给我起个名字吗？"

His brow furrowed in confusion and shock. "Your name?"  
他眉头紧皱，既困惑又震惊。“你的名字？”

She nodded, crimson eyes sparkling. "I do not have a name. I'd like for you to give me one."  
她点头，赤红的眼眸闪烁着光芒。“我没有名字。我希望你能给我起一个。”

A name. The request made Shinji's chest shudder; his father had not so much as bothered to offer any form of humanity to her. In all her innocence, she could probably not grasp the severity of such horrendous acts. Instead of rousing anger or hatred towards the man, he felt pity. Had his mother's death weighed so heavily on Gendo Ikari's soul?  
一个名字。这个请求让真嗣的胸口颤抖；他的父亲甚至没有费心给予她任何形式的人性。在她所有的纯真中，她可能无法理解这些可怕行为的严重性。他没有激起对那个男人的愤怒或仇恨，反而感到怜悯。他母亲的死是否对碇源堂的灵魂造成了如此沉重的负担？

"Can I think about it for a little while?" he asked back. "I've never named anybody before. Wouldn't want to mess it up."  
“我可以稍微考虑一下吗？”他反问道，“我以前从未给人起过名字。不想搞砸了。”

"That is acceptable." Her eyes drifted to the waves. "Has there been any luck?"  
“可以接受。”她的目光飘向海浪，“有进展吗？”

"Yeah, actually." Not only had there been luck in with the fish, the small project was starting to take shape. Even the tasteless rations were not so terrible when eaten with company. "The seed I found the other day is a little plant now. And I've been getting lots of stuff to work with this morning."  
"是啊，确实。" 不仅捕鱼运气不错，这个小项目也开始成型了。甚至那些乏味的口粮，在有人陪伴时也不那么难以下咽了。"前几天找到的种子，现在已经长成小植物了。而且今天早上我还找到了很多可以利用的东西。"

"That is… good to hear? It was said this was the correct response to hearing of someone's day." The inquisitiveness flowed in waves from her gentle voice.  
"那真是……好消息？听说听到别人讲述一天的事情时，这样回应是恰当的。" 她的声音温柔，好奇心如波浪般涌动。

"It is," Shinji answered, offering the best smile he could muster.  
"确实如此，" 真嗣回答道，尽力挤出了一个最好的微笑。

They fell into a comfortable silence, interrupted only by the sound of him munching on the food bars until they ran out. _I was hungrier than I thought,_ Shinji realized once the food was all but gone. More work meant more energy expended. Additionally, if he ate enough then Asuka would not feel the need to jam food into his mouth. His fingers brushed against the choker. _She's been wearing that scarf around the house all the time._  
他们陷入了一种舒适的沉默，只被他咀嚼食物棒的声音打断，直到它们被吃完。我比想象中更饿，真嗣意识到食物几乎被吃完时。更多的工作意味着更多的能量消耗。此外，如果他吃得足够多，那么明日香就不会觉得有必要把食物塞进他嘴里。他的手指触碰到项圈。她一直在家戴着那条围巾。

"The rations," Ms. Lookalike said after some time. "They were not given to me by Ms. Horaki or Mr. Suzuhara." She gingerly picked up the last bar and began nibbling on it. Her face scrunched up in distaste. It was wonderful to see her express emotion so fully. "The Second Child has been facilitating them."  
"那些补给品，" 像某人的女士过了一会儿说。"它们不是堀崎小姐或铃原先生给我的。" 她小心翼翼地拿起最后一根食物棒，开始小口咬着。她的脸皱了起来，露出厌恶的表情。看到她如此充分地表达情感真是太好了。"二号机驾驶员一直在提供这些。"

"Asuka?" Again, Shinji was taken aback as he stared at the red and white wrappers. "She gives these to you?"  
"明日香？" 真嗣再次感到惊讶，他盯着那些红白相间的包装纸。"她把这些给你？"

"Every day after finishing my duties and before going to the bathhouse, the Second Child meets me near this area and provides them, with instructions that you are to consume each and every one." Confusion and what he assumed was apprehension drew over her features. "Is she your partner, as Mrs. Horaki is to Mr. Suzuhara?"  
"每天完成任务后，去澡堂之前，二号机驾驶员都会在这个地方与我见面，并指示你要吃掉每一颗。" 她的脸上浮现出困惑和一种他认为是忧虑的表情。"她是你和碇先生一样的伴侣吗？就像松崎老师和铃原先生那样？"

Shinji's face colored in seconds. "L-Like Hikari and Toji? No! No, of course not. Nothing like that. I'm… a prisoner," he explained, tone becoming remorseful. "I'm not allowed to die, so she's only making sure I don't starve myself or anything."  
真嗣的脸在几秒钟内涨得通红。"像光和阿薰那样？不！当然不是。完全不是那样。我……是个囚犯，"他解释道，语气变得懊悔。"我不被允许死去，所以她只是确保我不会饿死或什么的。"

"Is this also why she comes to see you with such frequency?" She inquired next.  
"这也是她如此频繁来看你的原因吗？" 她接着问道。

Hikari's words, Kensuke's remarks and Toji's playful banter bounced around inside Shinji's skull, sowing doubt in the reasoning he had been convinced of for so long. "You know, I'm not really sure anymore," he admitted. "Lots of things have been pointed out to me lately. I have no clue why she comes around, but… I'd like to know, I'd like to ask her. Spend a little more time with her. With you, with Kensuke." His gaze softened at the setting sun. "With everyone."  
光子的言语、剑介的评论和东治的玩笑话在真嗣的脑海中回荡，动摇了他长久以来坚信的理由。“你知道吗，我现在真的不太确定了，”他坦白道，“最近有很多事情被指出来。我不明白她为何出现，但是……我想了解，我想问她。想多花点时间和她在一起。和你，和剑介。”他凝视着落日，目光柔和。“和大家。”

The first mountain had been conquered. Alas, in his mind it was now little more than a small hill. In front of him the red wasteland stretched out, with Wanderers and other horrors lurking in the grotesque world he had created. Strenuous and spiky mountains that stretched to the skies lay ahead. Little by little, step by step, perhaps he'd discover if redemption hid at the peak of the highest one.  
第一座山峰已被征服。然而，在他心中，它现在不过是个小山丘。在他面前，红色的荒原延展开来，漫游者和其它恐怖生物潜伏在他创造的怪诞世界中。前方是陡峭而尖锐的山脉，直插云霄。一步一步，一点一点，或许他会发现，在最高的山峰之巅是否隐藏着救赎。

"You wish to spend more time with her," Ms. Lookalike echoed, pensive. "I believe I understand, now. One wishes to spend more time with those that are special. It is… beautiful to behold."  
“你想多花时间和她在一起，”长得像她的女士若有所思地重复道，“我想我现在明白了。人们希望与特别的人共度更多时光。这……令人感动。”

The creaks of the old box and the same soft footsteps retreating announced the departure of his visitor. Shinji offered a second, more animated and grateful smile. "Thank you for the food. And thanks for coming to see me. It's nice to spend time with you like this."  
旧箱子的吱嘎声与那熟悉的轻柔脚步声渐行渐远，宣告着访客的离去。真嗣再次露出一个更加生动且感激的微笑。“谢谢你带来的食物。也谢谢你来看我。像这样和你共度时光，真的很美好。”

"I too enjoy these moments," she replied, and offered a warm smile. "One is supposed to say goodbye, yes?"  
“我也很享受这些时刻，”她回答道，并回以温暖的微笑。“人们常说再见，对吧？”

The girl's pure nature had become something to look forward to, as well. "Yeah. Did Hikari tell you what it means?" He asked. "I was speaking to her about it the other day."  
女孩的纯真本性也成了令人期待的事物。“嗯。光有告诉你这意味着什么吗？”他问道。“前几天我和她聊到这个。”

"Yes." The breeze caressed her face, made her own locks dance. "Goodbye is a promise to see each other again."  
"是的。" 微风轻抚她的脸庞，使她的发丝翩翩起舞。"告别是为了再次相见而许下的承诺。"

---

"Damn, five today! You're getting really good at this, Shinji!"  
"该死，今天五个了！你越来越擅长这个了，真嗣！"

Kensuke beamed at the young man as he inspected the catch, mouth salivating. Shinji's cooking was delicious, and after years of eating rations and gruel, every meal felt heavenly. Commerce with the other villages was at an all-time high, broadening their monotonous daily menu.  
健介对着年轻人检查的收获露出笑容，口水直流。真嗣的烹饪美味无比，经过多年食用军粮和稀粥，每一餐都感觉如同天赐。与其他村庄的贸易达到了前所未有的高峰，极大地丰富了他们单调的日常菜单。

"The tadpoles work great," Shinji remarked, and scratched his cheek. "I kind of feel bad about them, and about the earthworms, but it works great."  
"蝌蚪效果很好，" 真嗣说道，挠了挠脸颊。"我有点为它们和蚯蚓感到难过，但效果确实不错。"

_Yeah, I figured you'd say that. Kid doesn't want to hurt a fly,_ Kensuke mused while carrying the bag to the kitchen. Five rather robust fish had been the day's reward. "You want to try that smoked mackerel you wanted to do the other night? Part of your project?"  
是啊，我就知道你会这么说。那孩子连只苍蝇都不想伤害，健介一边想着一边把袋子拎到厨房。那天收获了几条相当健壮的鱼。"你想试试那晚想做的熏鲭鱼吗？你项目的一部分？"

Shinji hid his face. The strange pyre being erected within the ruins was impossible to miss. "Uhm, since they're of decent size, and I found some nice cedar to smoke it with in the afternoon. I think I can make some sushi with it later."  
真嗣把脸藏了起来。废墟中搭建的奇怪柴堆难以忽视。"嗯，既然它们个头不小，而且我下午找到了一些不错的雪松来熏制。我想晚点可以用它来做些寿司。"

Kensuke's mouth watered. "Sushi?" he asked, dumbfounded. "Oh, man! It's been years since I last had sushi! Man, you're really spoiling me, lately."  
健介的嘴角不禁流露出渴望。“寿司？”他惊讶地问道，“哦，天哪！我已经好几年没吃过寿司了！伙计，你最近真是太宠我了。”

"It's the least I can do," Shinji called out from the kitchen. He had already moved to the counter and was preparing the fish as they conversed. Kensuke glanced across the room and smirked at the silhouette glaring from the other room. "The new bean sprouts and the peach tree are growing well."  
“这是我起码能做的，”真嗣从厨房喊道。他已移步到操作台，边和他们交谈边准备鱼。健介瞥了一眼房间另一头，对着那边的身影微微一笑。“新种的豆芽和桃树长得不错。”

"Oh?" Kensuke sank into the seat with a deep, contented sigh. "Yeah, it's a good time of the year for new trees to grown. Plenty of rainfall." The cautious footfalls neared the dining area. "Want me to go set the fire while you do this?"  
“哦？”健介深深地坐进椅子里，满足地叹了口气。“是啊，这个季节很适合新树生长。雨水充足。”谨慎的脚步声逐渐靠近用餐区。“要不要我去生火，你继续做这个？”

"I can do it in a little while," Shinji replied. "You're probably very tired from working all day."  
"我一会儿就能搞定，" 真嗣回答道。"你工作了一整天，肯定很累了。"

"Nah, I'm good." Kensuke readjusted his glasses, smiling wide once the shadow of a certain Shikinami became more discernible. "It'll only be a couple of seconds. Thanks for the firewood, by the way."  
"没事，我挺好的。" 健介调整了一下眼镜，当某个式波的身影更加清晰时，他露出了灿烂的笑容。"只需要几秒钟。顺便谢谢你的柴火。"

Once he exited the house, Asuka walked over to the kitchen and plopped on the seat furthest from Shinji. Smirk ever present, Kensuke kept a close eye on the window as he worked with the firewood. Nobody said a thing for the first few minutes. Shinji busied himself with the fish while Asuka tapped at the table's surface, legs crossed.  
一走出房子，明日香就走到厨房，坐在离真嗣最远的座位上。健介一边处理柴火，一边紧盯着窗户，脸上始终带着一丝笑意。最初几分钟里，谁也没有说话。真嗣忙着处理鱼，而明日香则交叉着双腿，轻敲着桌面。

_Hmm, weird. She's always playing her video games at this hour. Another new development added to her sitting near us at dinner. I'll have to speak to Hikari about this.  
嗯，奇怪。她总是这个时候玩她的电子游戏。现在又多了个新变化，她开始在晚餐时坐在我们旁边。我得和光谈谈这件事。_

Another surprise lightened Kensuke's mood when it was Shinji who started talking. Hesitant at first, he told Asuka about the trees he was caring for around midday, and spoke of how one of the fish had almost caused him to fall into the water. Silence, anger or nonchalance had been the expected reaction. The cinders almost fell from Kensuke's shovel when Asuka demanded to know if he had eaten the rations.  
另一个惊喜让健介的心情轻松了一些，因为这次是真嗣先开口的。起初有些犹豫，他向明日香讲述了他在中午时分照顾的树木，以及一条鱼差点让他掉进水里的经历。沉默、愤怒或漠不关心是预期的反应。当明日香追问真嗣是否吃了口粮时，健介手中的铲子差点掉落。

Choosing to not meddle, Kensuke went about carrying the embers as slowly as possible. "Look at her, asking if he ate, asking which of the mackerels he caught first," he quietly said to himself. "Well... not really _asking_, but for her standards it's really something. Hey, old man." He turned towards the hill, eyes softening at the memory of his father. "Not doing too bad here, I think."  
"选择不去干涉，健介尽可能慢地搬运着灰烬。“看她，问他吃了没有，问他先抓到的是哪条鲭鱼，”他轻声自语，“好吧……不是真的在问，但以她的标准来看，这已经很了不起了。嘿，老头。”他转向山丘，眼中流露出对父亲的回忆。“我觉得，这里做得还不错。”

Asuka's tone remained skeptical; she provided half-bitten responses to Shinji's inquires and pretended not to be interested in the way the fish was prepared, but Kensuke noticed her body language was relaxed, comfortable. He had only seen her behave so after years of not meddling or pressing her for information. Shinji made it look so easy.  
明日香的语气依旧带着怀疑；她对真嗣的询问半咬着回答，假装对鱼的处理方式不感兴趣，但剑介注意到她的肢体语言放松了，显得舒适。他只在多年不干涉或逼问她信息后才见过她这样。真嗣让这一切看起来如此轻松。

"Guess fourteen years will do that to you." Once the cauldron was packed with fresh embers, Kensuke dusted his blackened hands on his cargo pants and took another glance at the window. Scents of ginger, orange, oil, fish and rice made his stomach demand nourishment. "Yeah, yeah. Let's just wait till Shinji's done. Look at that, one could almost say she's smiling a little."  
“十四年果然能改变很多。”当大锅装满新鲜炭火后，剑介在工装裤上擦了擦黑乎乎的手，又瞥了一眼窗户。姜、橙、油、鱼和米饭的香味让他的肚子开始渴望食物。“是啊，是啊。我们就等真嗣弄完吧。看那样子，简直可以说她有点在笑了。”

Eventually, he was ushered inside to share the meal, and found himself surprised a third time when Asuka sat at the table with them, scowling down at the sushi until she ate the first piece. Kensuke felt something magnificent swell up inside him when she muttered a 'not bad' and Shinji almost beamed with a joyous smile. She even interjected a few times as they spoke of their days, demanded more of this or that ingredient in future meals, and did _not_ ooze wrath whilst dinner lasted.  
最终，他被请进屋内共享晚餐，当看到明日香坐在桌旁，皱着眉头盯着寿司直到吃下第一片时，他第三次感到惊讶。当她低声说了句“还不错”，而真嗣几乎带着喜悦的微笑时，健介感到内心涌起一股美妙的感觉。她甚至在谈论日常时插了几句话，要求在未来的饭菜中加入更多这种或那种食材，并且在晚餐期间并没有流露出愤怒。

The same routine he had been seeing for the last few nights unfolded. Shinji curled up into his blankets, and tried to use whatever moonlight filtered through the window to read the dictionary for a few minutes. Some lines would be written on the last page, and the book would return to its place atop the jacket. The boy would then steal glances at the cap laying on the table until sleep claimed him.  
这几晚他一直在看到的同样例行程序再次上演。真嗣蜷缩进他的毯子里，试图利用透过窗户的月光读几分钟字典。一些句子会被写在最后一页，然后书会回到夹克上方的位置。男孩会偷偷看一眼放在桌上的帽子，直到睡意袭来。

Well into the night Asuka would rise, steal a glimpse at their sleeping forms and return to the bedroom. The significance of that feeling filling Kensuke's chest with excitement was a rather new one. "Not doing bad at all, old man," he whispered. "I think this is what people call hope. It's pretty great."  
深夜时分，明日香会起身，偷偷看一眼他们熟睡的样子，然后回到卧室。那种让健介胸中充满兴奋感的意义是一种相当新的体验。“做得不错嘛，老头，”他低声说，“我想这就是人们所说的希望。真是太棒了。”

"Oi, over there! Hand me the shovel, will you? Nah you idiot, that one!"  
"喂，那边那个！把铲子递给我，行不？不，你个傻瓜，是那一把！"

"Well be more specific! There's plenty of 'em!"  
"说得具体点！这里多的是！"

"Hey, somebody pass me a vest! Second pillar's been on the fritz for a while, we gotta fix it before the Wunder arrives!"  
"嘿，谁给我递件背心！第二根柱子老出问题，我们得在‘奇迹’号到来前修好它！"

"Listen to Mister Hard Worker over here! You're the one trying to sneak out every time!"  
"听听这位勤劳先生的话！每次想偷偷溜走的可是你！"

The more time passed, the more energetic and loud the workers became. Whereas his first days in the communal kitchen had been somber and quiet, the storage room felt like a large family area where everyone smiled, tapped each other on the shoulder and joked about their daily schedule. Early in the morning the villagers delivered their ingredients and took the day's rations.  
随着时间的推移，工人们变得越来越精力充沛和喧闹。而在他刚到公共厨房的那几天里，气氛沉闷而安静，储藏室现在感觉像是一个大家庭的聚会场所，每个人都面带微笑，互相拍拍肩膀，开着日常工作的玩笑。清晨，村民们送来食材，领取当天的口粮。

It took Shinji one to two hours to prepare the lunch boxes for the crews working by the pillars. Once the food was done, he'd store some of it away to take back to the house once the day ended. Following the shift in the kitchen, he walked back to the forest area where the youngsters huddled and collected ripe fruit. Many of them climbed on the highest trees, with an adult or two keeping watch not too far away.  
申吉需要一到两个小时来准备在柱子旁工作的工人们的午餐盒。一旦食物准备好了，他会留一些存起来，等一天结束时带回家。在厨房轮班结束后，他走回森林区域，那里年轻的孩子们聚集在一起采集成熟的果实。许多人爬到最高的树上，有一两个成年人不远处看护着。

He was feeling light that day. The night before Asuka had sat with them at dinner, and even somewhat complimented the sushi.  
那天他感到心情轻松。前一晚，明日香和他们一起吃了晚饭，甚至还夸赞了寿司。

Every so often one of the children would fall, scrape their knees or palms, but get back up instantly and keep playing while they worked. Ryoji brought a makeshift ball on some days, and either dodgeball or soccer was the reward for a good harvest. After repetitive visits the trees were denuded of ripe fruit, and the task slowly shifted to protecting and caring for the seedlings.  
时不时会有孩子摔倒，擦伤膝盖或手掌，但他们会立刻站起来继续玩耍和工作。有时，碇君会带一个自制的球，如果收获不错，他们就会玩躲避球或足球作为奖励。经过多次拜访，成熟的果实都被摘光了，任务逐渐转变为保护和照料幼苗。

"I'm still really pissed off about that," Ryoji repeated for the fourth time. "Did all that work at the pillars, learned how to fix the electrical feed, got through the first aid stuff with flying colors." He plucked a pear and threw it at Shinji's back. "Hey, you listening over there?"  
“我还是对那件事很生气，”碇君第四次重复道，“在支柱上做了那么多工作，学会了修理电力供应，急救知识也学得很好。”他摘了一个梨，扔向真嗣的背。“嘿，你在听吗？”

"Yeah," Shinji answered whilst picking up the hurled fruit. "You're really pissed off that Asuka ripped your application to shreds, and that Viko approved of it instead of being mad. So now you're even angrier because Kensuke told you today that it was all for the best."  
“嗯，”真嗣边回答边捡起扔过来的水果。“你真的很生气，因为明日香把你的申请撕得粉碎，而维克托却赞同她的做法，没有生气。现在你更生气了，因为今天健介告诉你，这一切都是为了你好。”

Ryoji pouted. "Damn, nobody has my back on this. You all suck."  
碇真嗣撅嘴道：“该死，没人站在我这边。你们都太差劲了。”

"I don't know much about families, or loved ones," Shinji admitted, gazing at the hills and the wretched visage beyond. "But maybe having them worry about you and want you to be safe is a good sign."  
“我不太懂家庭或亲情的意义，”真嗣凝视着远处的山丘和那令人厌恶的景象，坦白道，“但或许，他们担心你、希望你平安，这本身就是一种好的迹象。”

Ryoji's shoulder's slumped in defeat. He threw another pear, which Shinji caught. "Hey, look at you. Good reflexes there, Mister Fisherman."  
莲二的肩膀因挫败而下垂。他又扔了一个梨，真嗣稳稳接住。“嘿，看看你。反应真快啊，渔夫先生。”

"Well, it really is a surprise when a fish bites, you know." Another five seedlings were big enough to be transplanted into the field, which wracked his nerves more than any fish. "I lost plenty because they caught me by surprise. Guess it's helped wake me up a little bit."  
“嗯，你知道的，鱼咬钩时真的很意外。”又有五株幼苗长得足够大，可以移植到田里了，这比任何鱼都更让他紧张。“我因为被它们突袭而损失了不少。也许这倒让我稍微清醒了些。”

Shinji's chest lightened a bit upon seeing the other boy's now familiar smile. "It's nice to see. Hey, did you notice the peach you planted is growing crazy fast?"  
看到另一个男孩熟悉的笑容，真嗣的胸口感到一丝轻松。“看到你这样真好。嘿，你注意到你种的那棵桃树长得特别快吗？”

"It is, isn't it?" The day before, Ms. Lookalike had come to visit the fields, with her inquisitive gaze fixed on the small tree for a long time. "Fourteen leaves. Now we just have to wait about four to five years."  
"确实如此，不是吗？" 昨天，那位长得像某人的女士来到田间，她好奇的目光长时间停留在那棵小树上。"十四片叶子。现在我们只需等待大约四到五年。"

"Meh, considering I'm apparently grounded in this village for the foreseeable future, I guess we have to take turns looking after it, then." Ryoji beamed and pointed to the growing tree. "Once it bears fruit, you get to name it, that's the rule."  
"唉，考虑到我似乎要在村子里待上一段时间，看来我们得轮流照顾它了。" 亮司笑着指向正在生长的树。"一旦它结果，你就可以给它命名，这是规矩。"

"I don't see the point in naming a tree." Shinji straightened and gazed at the grass, breathing in the fresh air, and feeling life grow all around. There was indeed a small wooden marker near each tree, all with the Latin definition and the common Japanese name on them. "But I'd like to. It's the second time somebody's ever asked me for a name."  
"我不明白给一棵树命名的意义何在。" 真嗣挺直身子，凝视着草地，深吸一口新鲜空气，感受着四周生命的成长。确实，每棵树旁都有一个木制标记，上面写着拉丁定义和日文常用名。"但我愿意。这是第二次有人让我命名。"

The children laughed behind him. They threw the ball and chased one another, occasionally using a lemon or a pear to attack. Mr. Bunzaemon kept grumbling to himself from the shade, and kept an eye on the children's antics, still too sore to carry on with his lumber business. The day passed quietly amongst laughter, wet soil and sweet, ripe fruit.  
孩子们在他身后欢笑。他们扔着球，互相追逐，偶尔用柠檬或梨子发起攻击。文左卫门先生在树荫下不停地嘀咕着，同时留意着孩子们的顽皮行为，因伤势未愈而无法继续他的木材生意。这一天在笑声、湿润的泥土和甜美成熟的果实中悄然度过。

Just as Ryoji abandoned his task and stole the bag to be chased by the young entourage, an ominous crack diverted their attention. Mere miles away, one of the Wanderers tripped and crashed against the barrier. Some of the children behind him shrunk away in fear and stepped back. Both Ryoji and Bunzaemon stood, glaring at the horrid apparition.  
正当亮司放弃任务，偷走袋子被年轻随从追赶时，一声不祥的裂响转移了他们的注意力。仅仅几英里外，一名流浪者绊倒并撞上了屏障。他身后的几个孩子吓得缩了回去，退了几步。亮司和文左卫门都站了起来，怒视着那可怕的幻影。

Shinji saw _them_ again as they struggled and screamed in the thing's body. The grip on the duffle bag increased. If his father had his way, all those small children were going to be reduced to energy, or in the worst case, become one of those monstrous beings. The trees, the stream, the joyous works bringing fresh ingredients, the laughs, the hot meals after hard work, everything would disappear.  
真嗣再次看到他们在那东西体内挣扎和尖叫。他紧握着行李袋。如果他父亲得逞，所有这些小孩子都将被转化为能量，或者在最坏的情况下，变成那些怪物中的一员。树木、溪流、带来新鲜食材的欢乐劳作、笑声、辛勤工作后的热餐，一切都将消失。

Asuka had asked him not too long ago if he would be willing to fight. It sickened him to still feel uncertain, but with every passing day the fear dissipated, and the conviction solidified. "One tree at a time, one smile at a time," he whispered as the group returned to their homes and night descended. The stars glistened with a crimson tinge. "Earn, Shinji. Earn your redemption."  
不久前，明日香曾问他是否愿意战斗。他仍感到不确定，这让他恶心，但随着时间的推移，恐惧逐渐消散，信念愈发坚定。“一棵树接一棵树，一个微笑接一个微笑，”他低语着，当团队回到家中，夜幕降临时。星星闪烁着猩红的色调。“赚取吧，真嗣。赚取你的救赎。”

His hand curled into a fist. The mountain was still unimaginably high, nigh unconquerable. _You can start by coming up with a name for her, you know. She asked you, after all._  
他的手握成了拳头。那座山依然高不可攀，几乎无法征服。你知道，你可以从给她起个名字开始。毕竟，她问过你。

"Little by little." There was a new Blue Chinese Wisteria growing by a hill, not far from the stream. Lost in thought, he failed to realize how a certain redhead had also gazed at the firmament, and remembered him. "Maybe I can find a suitable tree to remember Kaworu by. I can have Ms. Lookalike name the wisteria, and then Asuka could name the peach. She'll probably say it's a stupid thing to do, probably call it 'the brat's tree' or something."  
“一点一点来。”在离小溪不远的小山旁，有一株新的蓝色中国紫藤正在生长。陷入沉思的他没有意识到，某个红发女孩也凝视着天空，想起了他。“也许我能找到一棵合适的树来纪念薰。我可以请那位长得像他的女士给紫藤命名，然后让明日香给桃树命名。她可能会说这是件愚蠢的事，可能会称之为‘那个小鬼的树’之类的。”

The tiniest chortle blossomed from his chest. "That'd be nice."  
他胸中绽开一丝轻笑。“那会很好。”

---

"_So that's what you're doing now? Gardening some stupid trees?"_  
“所以你现在就在干这个？种那些蠢树？”

"_Ah, yeah. And fishing. And, uhm… the food."_  
“啊，是的。还有钓鱼。还有，呃……食物。”

"_What about the hand? I haven't seen a bandage in days."_  
"那只手呢？我好几天没看到绷带了。"

"_It's all better now, at least Toji says so."_  
"现在全好了，至少阿司是这么说的。"

"_Whatever. Wasting time over counting leaves, great work."_  
"随便吧。浪费时间数叶子，真是好工作。"

"_It's actually great work he's doing!" Kensuke yelled from the yard as he worked on a car's engine. "Want to go check it out tomorrow? I wanted to go visit the old man, and I'd love some company. Then we can go check out the new sprouts."_  
"他干得真是不错！" 健介在院子里修理汽车引擎时喊道。"明天想去看看吗？我想去拜访那位老人，有人作伴更好。然后我们可以去看看新芽。"

It was already custom to travel in the old Suzuki. With Asuka sitting in the back seat, Shinji fought to not glance at her every time the car hit a rock or a hole in the street. Kensuke chatted away as he would, detailing which areas he was to visit that afternoon, and commented on how his next trip to the outskirts of the village was drawing near. Shinji tried to respond as best he could and ask for minor details, fumbled over his words and expected some angry retort.  
乘坐那辆旧铃木车已是惯例。明日香坐在后座，真嗣努力克制自己，每当车子碾过石头或路上的坑洞时，都不去瞥她一眼。健介一如既往地聊个不停，详细讲述下午打算去哪些地方，并提到他即将前往村庄边缘的行程。真嗣尽力回应，询问一些细节，结结巴巴，预料着会有愤怒的反驳。

_I saw her by the ruins yesterday,_ he thought, and strained to pay attention to Kensuke's words. _Ms. Lookalike asked if I had a name ready, but I still don't. Then I think I saw her. I've gotten the hang of cooking out there. Another trial run should do it, and if Asuka approves… then I can invite both her and Ms. Lookalike. It can be like that dinner Rei wanted to make for my father and I._  
昨天我在废墟旁看到了她，他心想，努力集中注意力听健介的话。那位长相相似的女士问我是否准备好了名字，但我还没有。然后我想我看到了她。我在那里做饭已经得心应手了。再试一次应该就可以了，如果明日香同意……那我就可以邀请她和那位女士。就像丽想为我父亲和我做的那顿晚餐一样。

"…and since Ryoji's birthday is coming along in a few days I thought I'd get him something, or build something for him, you know? Kinda wanted to give him that Renault, but I heard a thing or two about his mother's driving skills. May be better suited for his eighteenth birthday."  
“…而且因为龙司的生日快到了，我想给他买点什么，或者做点什么给他，你知道吗？本来想送他那辆雷诺的，但我听说了一些关于他妈妈驾驶技术的事。可能更适合他十八岁生日。”

"His birthday?" Shinji thought on how difficult it probably was to even find presents for loved ones in the village. "Oh, maybe I can try to cook something different."  
“他的生日？”真嗣思考着在村子里为所爱的人找礼物可能有多难。“哦，也许我可以尝试做些不同的菜。”

"Whatever keeps the brat with his stupid little feet rooted here," Asuka remarked. It was the first time she spoke ever since climbing in the car. "He was getting all sorts of stupid ideas. That's on you, Kenken."  
“只要能让那小子用他那双蠢脚留在这里，”明日香说道。这是她上车后第一次开口。“他满脑子都是些愚蠢的想法。这都是你的错，Kenken。”

Kensuke laughed and shrugged off the accusation. "Hey, gotta keep the kid distracted somehow. He's good at mechanical stuff, a hard worker, and motivated. Pretty much always in a good mood."  
健介笑着耸了耸肩，避开了指责。“嘿，总得想办法让那孩子分心。他擅长机械方面的东西，工作勤奋，有动力，基本上总是心情很好。”

"He also has a horrible English accent," Asuka added. Her face remained mostly hidden under the jacket. "What was the big idea with all the odd jobs and the application?"  
“他还有个糟糕的英语口音，”明日香补充道。她的脸大部分被夹克遮住。“那些奇怪的工作和申请是怎么回事？”

"Didn't want to crush the kid's dreams from the get-go, Asuka. Can't blame a guy for trying."  
“不想一开始就粉碎那孩子的梦想，明日香。不能怪一个人尝试。”

A quiet groan of disapproval reached Shinji's ears. "Foolish and pointless," said Asuka. "That kid is not stepping on the ship."  
一声不满的低吟传入真嗣的耳中。“愚蠢且无意义，”明日香说道，“那孩子是不会踏上船的。”

"Yeah, I know. Still, it was nice to see him excited like that."  
“是啊，我知道。不过，看到他那样兴奋还是挺好的。”

Shinji recalled the way the boy's eyes were filled with a quiet confidence, a sense of inner fortitude. Ryoji knew he was loved. He was loved by the village, by the children he played with, by his guardian, even by their leader. Every night he came home to a beaming Viko who was always excited to hear about the boy's day. There was a beauty in the way he loved, or how confidently he smiled.  
真嗣回想起那男孩眼中流露出的静谧自信，一种内在的坚韧。亮司知道自己是被爱的。他受到村庄的爱护，受到与他玩耍的孩子们的喜爱，受到他的监护人的关爱，甚至受到他们领袖的宠爱。每晚他回到家，迎接他的是总是满面笑容的维科，总是兴奋地想听他讲述一天的经历。他在爱中的姿态，或是他那自信的微笑，都美得令人动容。

"Ryoji's lucky." “怜司真幸运。”

Asuka scowled from the back seat. Shinji almost felt her glare pierce the back of his head. "Why? Because he gets to spend his days in this place like a guinea pig in a cage?"  
明日香从后座上皱眉瞪眼。真嗣几乎能感觉到她的目光穿透了他的后脑勺。“为什么？因为他能在这个地方像笼子里的实验小白鼠一样度过每一天？”

Kensuke threw a pleading look through the rear view mirror. "Come on, don't be like that," he said. The car stopped a few feet away from a hill. "There's plenty to look forward to in the future, even if it's in this small village. Here we are, first stop."  
健介透过后视镜投来恳求的目光。“拜托，别这样，”他说。车子在离一座小山几英尺远的地方停了下来。“未来还有很多值得期待的事，哪怕是在这个小镇上。我们到了，第一站。”

Dried up leaves crumpled under Shinji's feet as he followed Kensuke up the hill, Asuka following not too far behind. How strange, that the handheld was absent from her hands. They walked until they reached what he assumed to be a burial ground. Beside the small altar, a wooden incense holder stood out. The package entrusted to him in the morning was requested; Shinji gave the old box to Kensuke and watched him light the tip of a sandal stick.  
枯叶在真嗣脚下嘎吱作响，他跟着健介爬上山坡，明日香不远不近地跟在后面。奇怪的是，她手里竟然没有拿着掌机。他们一直走到一处他猜测是墓地的地方。在小祭坛旁边，一个木制香炉格外显眼。早上托付给他的包裹被要求在此使用；真嗣将那只旧盒子递给健介，看着他点燃了一根檀香棒的顶端。

They each sent their prayers and respects, hands clasped together and eyes closed.  
他们各自双手合十，闭上眼睛，默默祈祷并表达敬意。

"This is my father's resting place," Kensuke revealed once the quiet settled atop the hill. "Never thought he'd go away, to be honest. He was always so strong, always so busy. He never stopped working to make things better for everybody. Then suddenly one day, some stupid accident happens, and he's gone."  
“这是我父亲的安息之地，”健介在山丘上的宁静再次降临时透露道，“说实话，我从没想过他会离开。他总是那么坚强，总是那么忙碌。他从未停止工作，为了让大家过得更好。然后突然有一天，某个愚蠢的事故发生了，他就这么走了。”

Death. A dark, frightening concept. _The permanent ending of vital processes in a cell or tissue. To die, to disappear._ Kensuke's father had passed due to an accident, something unexpected and horrible. He glanced at Asuka's eye-patch. _Maim. To injure so severely… as to cause lasting damage._  
死亡。一个黑暗、令人恐惧的概念。细胞或组织生命过程的永久终止。死去，消失。 Kensuke 的父亲因一场意外离世，那是不期而至的可怕事件。他瞥了一眼 Asuka 的眼罩。致残。造成如此严重的伤害……以至于留下永久损伤。

"We had some decent times together, me and him. Worked hard on the this little place, tried to made sure everyone was okay," Kensuke carried on. Melancholy echoed through his voice despite the smile he displayed. "But in the end, it feels like we never had time to talk. He always wanted to be better, be stronger than he was, but we never talked enough for me to understand what he meant by either thing."  
“我们曾有过一些美好的时光，我和他。一起努力打理这个小地方，尽力确保每个人都没事，” Kensuke 继续说道。尽管他面带微笑，但声音中仍透出忧郁。“但最终，感觉我们从未有时间好好交谈。他总是想变得更好，比自己更强，但我们从未谈得足够多，让我理解他所说的这两件事的含义。”

Shinji gulped down the trepidation and ventured to speak. "It sounds like he was a great man."  
Shinji 咽下紧张，鼓起勇气开口。“听起来他是个了不起的人。”

"Yeah." Kensuke chuckled low in his throat, gazing deep into the small memento. "You know, Shinji. If you get the chance, you should try to talk to your father a little. Perhaps somewhere along the line, you'll understand each other."  
"嗯。" 健介低声轻笑，深邃地凝视着那件小纪念品。"你知道吗，真嗣。如果有机会，你应该试着和你父亲聊聊。也许在某个时刻，你们会互相理解。"

The request shocked him into silence, but even more astounding was the sound of Asuka's teeth grind as a growl resonated from her chest.  
这个请求让他震惊得哑口无言，但更令人惊讶的是，明日香咬牙切齿的声音伴随着胸腔中传出的低吼。

"You _do_ know his father is Gendo Ikari, the man who abandoned him at the age of four, don't you?" she spat, crossing her arms and glaring down at Kensuke. "How's he supposed to understand that maniac?"  
"你难道不知道他的父亲是碇源堂，那个在他四岁时就抛弃他的人吗？" 她厉声说道，双臂交叉，怒视着健介。"他怎么可能理解那个疯子？"

"I don't know. I just know talking things out helps. There's so many things to say." Kensuke shifted his gaze and warm smile to Shinji. "Don't you think so, Shinji?"  
"我不知道。我只知道把事情说出来会有帮助。有很多话要说。" 健介将目光和温暖的微笑转向真嗣。"你不这么认为吗，真嗣？"

"There's not a damn thing Shinji should have to say to that bastard," Asuka interjected a second time, voice turning harsher. "The man is a snake, and every word out his mouth is nothing but poison."  
"真嗣根本没必要对那个混蛋说任何话，" 明日香再次插话，声音变得严厉。"那人就是条毒蛇，他嘴里吐出的每一个字都是毒药。"

"Asuka's right, but..." he recalled the SDAT, the songs, the piece he continued to translate. Redemption. Why would he be allowed to search for it, and not his father? "If I had a chance, I think I'd like to talk to him. If anything, just to try to understand him. Even if it's just a little bit."  
"明日香说得对，但是..." 他想起了 SDAT，那些歌曲，他一直在翻译的那段乐章。救赎。为什么他可以寻找救赎，而他的父亲却不可以？"如果我有机会，我想我会愿意和他谈谈。哪怕只是为了尝试理解他。哪怕只是一点点。"

"Figures idiots would think alike." Asuka turned her back and walked down over to the car. "I'll be in the car."  
“果然笨蛋的想法都一样。”明日香转过身，走向车子。“我去车里待着。”

Kensuke and Shinji remained at the altar. After a second's hesitation Shinji knelt as well, clapped his hand in prayer, and bowed his head. _Thank you for raising such a strong man, sir. I never had the pleasure of meeting you, but I'm certain you are proud of him. I'm sorry that you're no longer with us. Your son is a wonderful man. He's the village commander, or leader, and he's a great leader at that. He's always happy to help, always with a smile. He's taken care of someone very dear to me for many years._  
健介和真嗣留在祭坛前。犹豫片刻后，真嗣也跪了下来，合掌祈祷，低头致敬。感谢您培养了这样一位坚强的人，先生。我未曾有幸与您见面，但我确信您会为他感到骄傲。很遗憾您已不在我们身边。您的儿子是个了不起的人。他是村里的指挥官，或者说领导者，而且是一位出色的领导者。他总是乐于助人，脸上常带笑容。多年来，他一直照顾着对我来说非常珍贵的人。

He thought about how wonderful it would be to see Asuka smile. Perhaps Kensuke had achieved that feat, and could help him make whatever little time remained precious, or at least pleasant. The person underneath his feet had raised such a person, one who had accompanied Asuka and made her smile.  
他想着如果能看到明日香微笑该有多好。或许健介已经做到了这一点，能帮助他在剩下的时间里创造珍贵或至少愉快的回忆。他脚下的人培养了这样一个人，陪伴着明日香并让她微笑。

_Gratitude,_ he mused, recalling both Kensuke, Ryoji, Ms. Lookalike, the villagers, and Asuka_. A strong feeling of appreciation to someone or something for what the person has done to help you._  
感激之情，他沉思着，回想起健介、亮司、那位长相相似的女士、村民们，还有明日香。对某人或某物因所做之事给予帮助而产生的强烈感激之情。

Shinji's head bowed lower as he reached through his pants pocket and placed a ripe lime atop the grave.  
真嗣的头更低了，他伸手从裤袋里掏出一颗熟透的青柠，轻轻放在墓碑上。

_Thank you.  谢谢你。_

Once the formalities were over they drove over to one of the pillars, where Kensuke disappeared behind a mass of disgruntled workers complaining about the difficulty to breathe. The small container weighed heavily in Shinji jacket pocket while he and Asuka sat inside the car, not saying a word.  
仪式结束后，他们驱车来到一根柱子旁，只见 Kensuke 消失在一群抱怨呼吸困难的烦躁工人之中。那个小容器沉甸甸地压在真嗣的夹克口袋里，而他与明日香坐在车内，一言不发。

Why was she not playing her video games as usual? Why was her gaze lost in the distance, contemplative instead of ravenously angry? The sight of a calm, only slightly resentful Asuka was new, and therefore terrifying. _It's nothing but a stupid bit of pear jam,_ he thought. His hand fumbled with the small package. Focusing on tiny, foolish details like whether the jam was too sweet helped him focus on the present. Kaworu would have probably pressed him to move forward. _Earn, Third Child. Earn, Shinji._  
她为何不像往常那样玩游戏？为何她的目光迷失在远方，沉思而非暴怒？平静且略带怨气的明日香，这景象既新鲜又令人恐惧。他心想，不过是一小罐愚蠢的梨酱罢了。他的手摸索着那个小包裹。专注于诸如果酱是否太甜这类微不足道的细节，有助于他专注于当下。渚薰或许会催促他向前迈进。赚取吧，第三适格者。赚取吧，真嗣。

He presented the small package with the disposable spoon, and smiled as naturally as possible. "Here. There's been a lot of ripe fruit lately. I mixed it with a bit of cinnamon, some honey and lime." It felt natural to offer the meal. For a precious heartbeat they were back at school, back when things made sense. "Tried to make it as balanced as possible."  
他递上那个装着一次性勺子的小包裹，尽可能自然地微笑。“给。最近水果熟得很多。我加了点肉桂、蜂蜜和柠檬。”提供这顿饭显得很自然。有那么珍贵的一瞬间，他们仿佛回到了学校，回到了事情尚有逻辑可循的时候。“尽量做得均衡些。”

Asuka's hand slowly lifted. His eyes were closed, so Shinji once again lost the chance to see her face color slightly as the strongest sense of familiarity overcame her. "Pff, yeah right. I'll be the judge of that." She snatched the treat away and wasted little time in taking her first bite.  
明日香的手缓缓抬起。他闭着眼睛，因此真嗣又一次错过了看到她脸上微微泛红的瞬间，当最强烈的熟悉感袭来时。“噗，得了吧。我来评判一下。”她一把夺过点心，毫不犹豫地咬下了第一口。

Drawing upon all his willpower, Shinji opened his lids just in time to see Asuka's eye widen. Surprise, perhaps? Shock, maybe? He'd never know; a second later her face hid away under the hood and the curtain of wild auburn. The girl with Rei's features was always so eager to learn, so eager to ask. _One meal at a time, one step at a time, Shinji._  
凭借所有的意志力，真嗣睁开眼帘，正好看到明日香的眼睛睁大。是惊讶吗？或许是震惊？他永远不会知道；一秒钟后，她的脸隐藏在兜帽和狂野的赤褐色发丝下。那个有着绫波特征的女孩总是那么渴望学习，那么渴望提问。一次一顿饭，一步一步来，真嗣。

"H-How is it?" he ventured at last, and took out his own portion. "I can try another way, add whatever's needed. Uhm… I planted a peach tree the other day. If it grows, a-and it bears fruit, there's a couple of things I'd like to try. Do you like peach?"  
“这……这味道怎么样？”他终于鼓起勇气问道，并拿出了自己的那份。“我可以尝试另一种做法，添加任何需要的东西。呃……前几天我种了一棵桃树。如果它长大了，结了果，我有几样东西想试试。你喜欢桃子吗？”

"I haven't _seen_ a peach in about eight years," Asuka stated. Her eye centered on the tray, and on how its contents quickly disappeared. "And this? This isn't bad. Good balance. Not too sweet, just the right amount of a sour aftertaste. Cinnamon's a good touch."  
"我已经大约八年没见过桃子了，" 明日香说道。她的目光聚焦在托盘上，看着里面的东西迅速消失。"而这个？这个不错。味道平衡得很好。不太甜，恰到好处的一点酸味后劲。肉桂是个不错的点缀。"

The plastic container danced in between his fingers as feeble hunger invaded his senses. Asuka ate more readily each day. "There's a bit more if you want." Giving away his portion was as easy as ignoring Viko's rants on botany. "I had a strong breakfast with Kensuke this morning. Lots of leftovers from last night."  
塑料容器在他手指间轻巧地跳动，微弱的饥饿感侵袭着他的感官。明日香每天吃得越来越香。"如果你想要，还有一点。" 把自己的那份让出去就像无视 Viko 关于植物学的唠叨一样简单。"今天早上我和健介吃了一顿丰盛的早餐。昨晚剩了很多。"

_Oh,_ Shinji thought in surprise once the second treat was snatched away. _Ryoji was right about the jam. Hmm, maybe… strawberries. Viko said he's growing strawberries in his garden. He's saving them for Ryoji's birthday. If I can get some flour and eggs, and ask Mr. Koga for the smaller oven. A cake._  
哦，真嗣惊讶地想，当第二个点心被抢走时。凉二关于果酱的猜测是对的。嗯，也许是……草莓。Viko 说他花园里种了草莓。他留着给凉二的生日。如果我能弄到一些面粉和鸡蛋，再向古贺先生借用小烤箱。一个蛋糕。

"Don't think for a second I'm buying that crap about a strong breakfast." Asuka's voice shook him from the fantasy of baking. Half of a protein bar coated in jam was pushed in his direction. "Eat."  
“别以为我会信你那套关于丰盛早餐的鬼话。”明日香的声音将他从烘焙的幻想中拉回现实。半块涂满果酱的蛋白棒被推到他面前。“吃吧。”

"Right." His stomach jumped in joy after he took a first bite. "Thanks."  
“好的。”他咬下第一口后，胃里顿时感到一阵喜悦。“谢谢。”

"Idiot." The word felt like a greeting almost, a welcome home. It certainly felt much better than when she called him brat. "That song. Twenty-three. Bach's concerto. It's not a horrible rendition of the piece."  
“傻瓜。”这个词听起来几乎像是一种问候，一种回家的欢迎。这当然比她叫他小鬼时感觉好多了。“那首曲子，第二十三号，巴赫的协奏曲。演奏得还不算糟糕。”

_The… the what?_ Shinji almost choked on his own breath. _That's song twenty-three in my tape. The other day… I thought I'd just left it in another spot._ "You've… uh… yeah. That's a great song. I like the overture the best."  
这……这是什么？真嗣差点被自己的呼吸呛到。这是我磁带里的第二十三首歌。前几天……我还以为只是放错地方了。“你……呃……是啊。那首歌很棒。我最喜欢序曲部分。”

"Do you play? An instrument, I mean," Asuka clarified.  
“你会演奏吗？我是说乐器，”明日香补充道。

Shinji's fingers tingled with the memory of strings producing deep, mournful notes. "I used to. The cello, I mean. I used to play the cello, but I left it at my teacher's house when my father called me to Tokyo."  
真嗣的手指因回忆起弦乐奏出的深沉哀伤音符而微微发麻。“我以前会的。我是说大提琴。我以前拉大提琴，但父亲叫我来东京时，我把琴留在了老师家里。”

Asuka nodded, shocking Shinji yet again when she relinquished the spoon and used a finger to scoop up the remnants of jam from the container. "Viola. Had to learn it in training. Never really liked to play, but it becomes part of the routine after a while."  
明日香点点头，当她放弃勺子，用手指从容器中刮起剩下的果酱时，再次让真嗣感到震惊。“瞧，这是训练中学到的。其实我并不怎么喜欢演奏，但久而久之就成了日常的一部分。”

The cramped air within the car shifted. Shinji's heart started beating wildly in his chest again. "Training? How long… I mean, if you don't me asking. How long did you train to become an Eva pilot?"  
车内拥挤的空气似乎发生了变化。真嗣的心又开始在胸腔里狂跳。“训练？多久……我是说，如果不介意我问的话。你训练了多久才成为 Eva 驾驶员？”

"Ever since I can remember," Asuka replied. Her gaze fixed on a Wanderer striding beside the barrier. "It's all I've ever known. It was either become an Eva pilot, or become nothing. My purpose was decided before my birth."  
“从我有记忆开始，”明日香回答。她的目光锁定在屏障旁行走的一个流浪者身上。“这就是我所知道的一切。要么成为 Eva 驾驶员，要么什么都不是。我的使命在我出生前就被决定了。”

Against his better judgment, Shinji dared another inquiry. "By your parents?"  
尽管心知不妥，真嗣还是鼓起勇气再次发问。“是你的父母选的吗？”

"I don't have any." The statement rang heavy, bitter. "I have no father, and my mother was gone before I ever opened my eyes. I was chosen for this, nothing more."  
“我没有父母。”这句话沉重而苦涩。“我没有父亲，母亲也在我睁眼之前就离开了。我被选中，仅此而已。”

Realization dawned. It tasted sourer than any unripe lime. The DSS choker burned against his skin, and for the first time in days, the cut in Shinji's wrist burned. "Like a prisoner."  
真相大白，却比未熟的酸橙还要苦涩。DSS 项圈紧贴着他的皮肤，灼热难当，而多日未觉的腕上伤口，也在此刻隐隐作痛。“像囚犯一样。”

Asuka said nothing in return. Kensuke returned to the car soon afterwards, hands covered with grease and soot, and they drove back to the train station. Shinji saw Asuka throw away the green jacket and stretch. Cold wind brushed against the exposed skin of his neck and chest once the trio started walking.  
明日香没有回应。不久后，健介回到了车上，双手沾满了油污和煤灰，他们驱车返回火车站。真嗣看到明日香扔掉了那件绿色夹克，伸展身体。三人开始步行时，寒风轻拂过他裸露的脖颈和胸膛。

From the corner of his eye, he saw her shiver ever so slightly.  
他用眼角余光瞥见她微微颤抖。

The walk to the clearing and the stream felt exhausting despite him having barely moved through the entire day. Nervousness made his hands shake. Gone was the disconnect from reality, replaced by hyper-awareness of his own emotions. What if she found the seedlings pathetic, or sickly? It was foolish to think some weak little plant would astound her as much as it did Ms Lookalike. The same queasiness made his feet heavy as they meandered along the path towards the stream.  
尽管他一整天几乎没怎么动，但走到那片空地和小溪的路程却让他感到疲惫不堪。紧张让他的手颤抖。那种与现实脱节的感觉消失了，取而代之的是对自己情绪的超敏感。如果她觉得这些幼苗可怜或病态怎么办？以为这些弱小的植物能像那位相似的女士一样让她惊叹，真是愚蠢。同样的恶心感让他的脚步沉重，沿着通往小溪的小径蹒跚前行。

"Man, it's great to have somebody like Viko around. Guy just cannot catch a break. Look at all these trees! All he weeds gone from the roots, every single dead branch cleaned away. Even the path is trimmed, and the crazy bastard _still_ finds time to cut down old trees and turn them into firewood or charcoal. I tell you, he's tireless."  
“老兄，有 Viko 这样的人在身边真是太棒了。那家伙就是没个消停的时候。看看这些树！所有的杂草都被连根拔起，每根枯枝都被清理干净。就连小路也修剪过了，而这个疯狂的家伙还有时间砍倒老树，把它们变成柴火或木炭。我跟你说，他真是精力无穷。”

_Like you, you mean,_ Shinji thought. He was worried that Asuka's plugsuit would get muddy, but she seemed unbothered while walking behind them, arms crossed. _The two of you work all day and night to try and fix the mess I made. The mess my father intended me to make. One step at a time, Shinji. You can't start with the whole forest._  
“像你一样，对吧？”真嗣心想。他担心明日香的插入栓服会弄脏，但她似乎毫不在意，双手交叉跟在他们后面走着。你们俩日夜不停地工作，试图修复我造成的混乱。这是我父亲本意让我制造的混乱。一步一个脚印，真嗣。你不能一开始就想着整个森林。

"Does anyone actually know what happened to him?" Shinji asked once they reached the stream.  
“有人知道他到底发生了什么事吗？”真嗣在他们到达小溪时问道。

Kensuke massaged his jaw and looked away, pensive. "All we know for sure is that he's not Japanese. He was the only survivor of what we think was a big entourage." His other hand clapped one of the older lemon trees. "I found… bones while looking for scraps. Lots of them, maybe twenty people or more. About two or three had a similar vest to Viko's. The rest… I'd seen them before. Scavengers. The lowest of the low. Whatever that guy had to do to survive… I respect it."  
健介揉了揉下巴，若有所思地移开视线。“我们唯一确定的是他不是日本人。他是我们认为的一大群人中的唯一幸存者。”他的另一只手拍了拍一棵较老的柠檬树。“我在寻找残骸时发现了……骨头。很多，可能有二十人或更多。其中两三个穿着类似维科的背心。其余的……我以前见过。拾荒者。最低贱的那种。无论那个人为了生存做了什么……我尊重这一点。”

"_People did it."_ “人们会这么做。”

Ryoji's voice rang loud in his mind. Regardless of the horrors, the strange man still smiled away and gifted everyone fruit, lemonade and smiles. Amidst an apocalyptic world, Misato could not have hoped for a better guardian to protect and love her son.  
凌二的嗓音在他脑海中回响。尽管经历了种种恐怖，那个陌生男子依然微笑着，给每个人送上水果、柠檬水和笑容。在这个末日世界中，美里无法奢望有比这更好的守护者来保护和爱护她的儿子。

"He's a tree-hugging goofball," Asuka added. "But I guess there's lots of those in this dumb village, and Katsuragi's offspring could be better off. Now where the hell are these great 'sprouts'? You want me to report back to the Wunder how _grass_ is growing according to plan?"  
"他是个抱树的傻瓜，" 明日香补充道。"不过我想这个蠢村子里这种人多得是，而且葛城的孩子可能会过得更好。现在这些伟大的'幼苗'到底在哪儿？你想让我回去告诉 Wunder 号，草是按计划长出来的吗？"

"Inform them we have our own peach tree while you're at it." Kensuke laughed, and pointed to the row of layered seedlings. "Say, how about showing our dear Shikinami a bit of our hard work, Ikari?"  
"顺便告诉他们我们有自己的桃树。" 真希笑了，指向那一排分层种植的幼苗。"说起来，要不要给我们的亲爱的式波展示一下我们的辛勤工作，碇？"

The scent of wet earth and rain washed over Shinji whilst he hesitantly pointed at the absurdly protected and sheltered peach seedling. Trepidation, expectancy, the slightest glimmer of hope; emotions long since asleep in his being rose anew when Asuka crouched down to inspect the plant. Her eye narrowed, she scrutinized each detail, and upon finding no sign of disease or decay, rose to her feet and gave a careless shrug.  
当真嗣犹豫地指向那棵被过度保护和遮蔽的桃树幼苗时，湿润泥土和雨水的气息扑面而来。紧张、期待，一丝微弱的希望；这些久已沉睡在他心中的情感重新苏醒，当明日香蹲下检查植物时。她眯起眼睛，仔细审视每一个细节，在未发现任何疾病或腐烂的迹象后，她站起身来，随意地耸了耸肩。

"So it's a plant. That's the great reveal? What a wonderful alternative to spending the day laying in bed."  
"所以就是一株植物。这就是所谓的重大发现？真是比整天躺在床上强多了的绝妙替代品。"

"Hey, I didn't see you reach for the WonderSwan at any point today," Kensuke was quick to mention. He stretched next to the stream. "Ikari, come check this out. Plenty of small, sweet water fish lately. Lots of tadpoles too, thanks to the rain. Think you can get us two or more fish tomorrow? Koga's planning on a big surprise for Ryoji."  
"嘿，我今天可没见你碰过 WonderSwan，" 真嗣迅速指出。他在溪边伸了个懒腰。"碇，过来看看这个。最近有很多小巧甜美的溪鱼。多亏了这场雨，蝌蚪也很多。你觉得明天能帮我们抓到两条以上的鱼吗？高坂正计划给凌波一个惊喜。"

With the remnants of sunlight, the three of them sat on a tree trunk across the stream. Hours drifted away in tune with the evening symphony of birds, insects and frogs. They spoke of a possible location for the festivities, food for the villagers, and of what would entice the Katsuragi boy the most.  
在夕阳的余晖中，他们三人坐在溪对岸的树干上。时间随着鸟儿、昆虫和青蛙的夜晚交响曲悄然流逝。他们讨论着庆祝活动的地点、村民们的食物，以及最能吸引葛城男孩的东西。

Asuka voiced out her opinions, even if it was only to point out the absurdity of it all. With each interjection, awareness finished climbing into Shinji's psyche. The second time he saw her shudder with cold, he offered his own dark jacket with a blush, still not understanding why she left the green one at the house. She took it without much complaint, and kept it as the evening wore on.  
明日香直言不讳地表达了自己的看法，即便只是为了指出这一切的荒谬。随着每一次插话，意识逐渐渗透进真嗣的内心。第二次看到她因寒冷而颤抖时，他红着脸将自己的深色夹克递了过去，仍不明白她为何将绿色那件留在了家里。她没怎么抱怨就接受了，并一直穿着直到夜幕降临。

Shinji realized what the penance was at some point, and saw the path to achieve liberation as clearly as the bloody crosses on the moon. When the sun went down, both he and Kensuke started walking back to the station. Asuka remained near the tree he was supposed to name.  
真嗣在某一刻意识到了赎罪的意义，清晰地看到了通往解脱的道路，就像月亮上血红的十字架一样。当太阳落山时，他和健介开始步行返回车站。明日香则留在他本应命名的那棵树旁。

The stupidest idea yet blossomed in his brain. A world where the sky was blue, where trees grew wildly as they had before and no monstrous apparitions sprung from the ground. The short conversation from before jumped back into memory.  
他脑海中浮现出一个最愚蠢的想法。一个天空蔚蓝、树木自由生长如初、地面不再涌现怪异幻影的世界。之前的简短对话再次跃入记忆。

"_So, uhm… is this also the place you live in, Asuka?"_  
"呃…这里也是你住的地方吗，明日香？"

"_What are you, stupid? This is the place I protect."_  
"你傻吗？这是我守护的地方。"

A place she protected, but not one where she felt she belonged. If he fought as well, if he gave everything he had, would it be possible to give Asuka a place she could call home?  
一个她守护着，却不觉得自己属于那里的地方。如果他也战斗，如果他倾尽所有，是否能为明日香创造一个她能称之为家的地方？

He did not see the Wanderers that night. Instead, he dreamed of a large tree providing shade, blooming a most lush rose which danced with the wind. Crimson-golden hair swaying near his eyes, and shining under the afternoon sun.  
那一夜，他没有见到流浪者。相反，他梦见了一棵大树，提供着阴凉，绽放着一朵最为茂盛的玫瑰，随风起舞。深红金色的发丝在他眼前摇曳，在午后阳光下闪闪发光。

---

Asuka stayed behind, hugging the idiot's sweater close. The cold breeze turned chilly in minutes when stars appeared in the night sky. She stood next to the seedling Shinji had been so adamant on caring for, glaring down at the tiny plant with disdain and an overbearing nostalgia.  
明日香留了下来，紧紧抱着那傻瓜的毛衣。冷风在几分钟内变得刺骨，当夜空中的星星出现时。她站在真嗣坚持要照顾的那株幼苗旁，带着轻蔑和难以抑制的怀旧之情，瞪着那小植物。

"_I'm supposed to name it, when it bears fruit. W-Would you like to do that? Give it a name, I mean?"_  
“当它结果时，我应该给它命名。你愿意做这件事吗？给它起个名字，我是说？”

"_Name a tree? What kind of stupid idea is that? Do you think the tree cares for that?"_  
"给树取名字？这是什么愚蠢的主意？你以为树会在乎这个吗？"

"_I guess not, but still. It's like a tradition. Every tree around his has a n-"_  
"我想不会，但还是。这就像一种传统。他周围的每棵树都有一个名字——"

"_Whatever. If by some miracle we're both still standing here in five years, then we can discuss the stupid tradition."_  
"随便吧。如果五年后我们还能奇迹般地站在这里，那时再来讨论这个愚蠢的传统。"

The way Shinji's eyes had filled with joy lightened a portion of the permanent burden inside her chest. He had smiled in the car, as well. The same sheepish grin from school, denoting just how happy it made him to deliver her bento.  
真嗣眼中洋溢的喜悦减轻了她胸中那块永恒的负担。他在车里也笑了，同样的腼腆笑容，表明他送便当给她时有多开心。

"The Idiot Tree," Asuka muttered. The quiet days, the songs playing in her head courtesy of his SDAT. The way he chuckled at Kensuke's jokes now instead of staring off into the distance... all these details were affecting her. She was snickering more often, even if it was just a harsh grate that lasted half a second. Her body wasn't aching as much, and at night… it was not so lonesome. "The Dumbass Tree. The Brat's Tree."  
“傻瓜树，”明日香喃喃自语。那些平静的日子，他的 SDAT 在她脑海中播放的歌曲。他现在对剑介的笑话会笑了，而不是呆呆地望着远方……所有这些细节都在影响着她。她笑得更多了，尽管那只是持续半秒的刺耳笑声。她的身体不再那么疼痛，夜晚……也不再那么孤单。“笨蛋树。小鬼的树。”

Nothing felt adequate. "What do you think, in there?" she asked the Angel snoozing within her. "Maybe we can name it the Curse of Eva tree, how about that? Or maybe…" The more time passed and the days went by, the more she wanted her supposed vacation not to end. "The Boring Tree. Doesn't sound so bad. Meh, this is dumb. It should just be called a peach."  
一切都感觉不够。“你觉得呢，在里面？”她问着沉睡在她体内的使徒。“也许我们可以把它命名为‘EVA 诅咒之树’，怎么样？或者……”随着时间的流逝，日子一天天过去，她越来越希望自己所谓的假期不要结束。“无聊树。听起来也不坏。呃，这太蠢了。它应该就叫桃树。”

"Well, that's exactly what it is." A familiar, annoying voice said from behind. Asuka rolled her eye. "But not just any peach," Viko explained. He was one of the very few who could sneak up on her. His footfalls were muted by the wet grass, and he always walked with stealth, like a soldier. "The sweetest in the world. I only had it once as a kid. My brother stole some from our commanding officer. Ah, those were the days."  
"嗯，这正是它的意义所在。"一个熟悉而讨厌的声音从背后传来。明日香翻了个白眼。"但不仅仅是任何桃子，"维克解释道。他是极少数能悄无声息接近她的人之一。他的脚步被湿润的草地减弱，总是像士兵一样悄无声息地行走。"世界上最美味的桃子。我小时候只吃过一次。我哥哥从我们的指挥官那里偷了一些。啊，那些日子真是美好。"

"You don't say," Asuka responded, uninterested. That she remembered, it was the first time man addressed her directly. "What is it with you and coming here at night?"  
"你不说我也知道，"明日香回应道，兴趣缺缺。据她所知，这是第一次有人直接对她说话。"你为什么总是晚上来这里？"

The 'stranger' as Shinji called him shrugged with a smile, produced a small music player and began to sway to the tune of an old song. "My brother told me even trees need some love from time to time, especially in dire situations."  
被真嗣称为'陌生人'的他微笑着耸了耸肩，拿出一个小音乐播放器，随着一首老歌的旋律摇摆起来。"我哥哥告诉我，即使是树木有时也需要一些关爱，尤其是在困境中。"

"Must be weird, huh," Asuka remarked, glancing at the plant by her feet. One stomp, a single footstep and it'd become nothing but a green smudge in the mud. "Seeing your life's work like this. Heard this place was a wasteland twelve years ago."  
“一定很奇怪吧，”明日香说道，目光扫过脚边的植物。只需一脚，一个脚步，它就会化作泥泞中一抹绿色的污迹。“看到自己毕生的心血变成这样。听说十二年前这里还是一片荒地。”

"One tree at a time," Viko intoned. "Little by little, just like Shinji." He came to stand beside her, staring off into the distance, and the lush green ocean that stretched before them. "Soon enough you find yourself doing impossible things. What would be an impossible thing for you, Major?"  
“一棵树接一棵树，”维克托缓缓说道，“一点一滴，就像真嗣那样。”他走到她身边，凝视着远方，那片郁郁葱葱的绿色海洋在他们面前延展。“很快你会发现自己在做不可能的事情。对你来说，什么是不可能的事，少校？”

A chair outside the train station overlooking the ocean. Lazy afternoons playing with the WonderSwan and not having a timer reaching zero in her brain at all times. Rising from bed and seeing the tiny box rest on the table. Music, gentle and forlorn, soothing her mind and erasing the childhood memories of constant solitude. Someone to pat her head and tell her she was enough.  
在火车站外眺望大海的长椅上。慵懒的下午玩着 WonderSwan，脑海中不再有计时器随时归零的压迫感。起床时看到那小盒子静静躺在桌上。柔和而哀伤的音乐，抚慰心灵，抹去童年记忆中无尽的孤独。有人轻拍她的头，告诉她已经足够好了。

"A normal life," she revealed. Viko was known for keeping secrets, and was the annoying, tree-hugging lunatic everybody in the village endeared. There was no risk in letting him know of her foolish idea. "Something boring. Waiting at a train station, walking to school, reading, listening to music. Some place where the sky is blue, and there's no battles left to fight. A boring, monotonous existence in this dumb village."  
"平凡的生活，"她坦白道。Viko 以保守秘密著称，是村里人人都喜爱的那个烦人的、拥抱树木的疯子。让她愚蠢的想法被他知道并无风险。"一些无聊的事。在火车站等待，步行去学校，阅读，听音乐。某个天空湛蓝、不再有战斗的地方。在这个愚蠢的村庄里过着单调乏味的生活。"

"Hmm." Viko nodded, and crouched next to the growing tree. "Quite the impossible thing for the Second Child, I'd say. A normal life. A life where you can do things your way. Ah, that reminds me." A bottle was pressed into her hand. "Remember to drink your lemonade, and have Shinji drink his, as well. It's good for you."  
"嗯。" Viko 点点头，蹲在日渐茁壮的树旁。"对二号机驾驶员来说，这可是件不可能的事，我得说。平凡的生活。能按自己的方式行事的生活。啊，这让我想起来了。"他将一瓶饮料塞到她手里。"记得喝你的柠檬水，也让真嗣喝他的。对你有好处。"

Asuka took the offered drink and downed a few sips. "What am I, his wife or something? He can drink by himself. He's not catatonic anymore, in case you didn't notice."  
明日香接过递来的饮料，喝了几口。"我是他老婆还是怎么的？他自己能喝。他不再木僵了，你没注意到吗？"

"Oh, everybody noticed! Isn't it grand?" Viko walked over to the biggest, oldest tree in the clearing, and smacked the trunk playfully. "He's a great guy. It's awesome to see I'm not alone in this. Right?" he asked the trunk, and punched it as though it were an old friend. He turned to Asuka. "It's nice to know I'm not the only one who believes in Shinji Ikari."  
"哦，大家都注意到了！这不是很棒吗？" Viko 走到空地上最大、最古老的树旁，调皮地拍了拍树干。"他是个很棒的家伙。看到我不是唯一一个这样想的，真是太好了。对吧？" 他对着树干问道，仿佛它是一位老朋友，还捶了它一拳。他转向明日香。"知道我不是唯一一个相信碇真嗣的人，感觉真好。"

Temper flaring, Asuka's head whipped in Viko's direction. She glared, eye narrowed while the eyepatch glowed a light blue. "Who the hell said I believe in him?"  
怒火中烧，明日香猛地转向 Viko。她瞪大眼睛，眼罩发出淡淡的蓝光。"谁说我相信他了？"

"I did! And you do, no need to lie to me. My lips are always sealed, Major."  
"我说了！而且你确实相信，没必要对我撒谎。我的嘴可是很严的，少校。"

"I wish," she commented, arms crossed. Why had she decided to leave her own jacket in the house? Had she _wanted_ Shinji to offer his? "You talk too damn much."  
"我希望，"她双臂交叉评论道。为什么她决定把外套留在家里？她是想让真嗣主动提供他的外套吗？"你废话太多了。"

"And I sing, also!" The man cleared his throat, produced an artistic bow and rose with a smile. "This piece goes to my dearest forest, to our fearless Major Shikinami, and of course, to you," Viko's hand caressed the irregularities around the tree bark with fondness. "Я скучаю по тебе."  
"我还会唱歌呢！"那人清了清嗓子，优雅地鞠了一躬，起身时面带微笑。"这首曲子献给我最亲爱的森林，献给我们无畏的少校式波，当然，也献给你，"维科的手温柔地抚摸着树皮上的凹凸不平。"我想你。"

The foreign accent drew her attention, yet before she could demand to know what language that was, the man's voice flowed through the clearing. "And now… the end is near. And so I face the final curtain. My friend," he sang, and signaled to her. "I'll say it clear, I'll state my case… of which I'm certain. I've lived a life that's _**full**_. I've traveled each and every highway… and more, much more than this, I did it my way…"  
那外国口音吸引了她的注意，然而在她能质问这是什么语言之前，那人的歌声已经飘荡在空地上。"现在……终点近在眼前。于是我面对最后的帷幕。我的朋友，"他唱道，并向她示意。"我会说得清楚，我会陈述我的理由……我确信。我过了一个充实的生活。我走过了每一条道路……而且，更重要的是，我走自己的路……"

"Regrets, I've had a few," she whispered along from memory. It was one of Mari's favorite songs, after all. "But then again, too few to mention. I did… what I had to do, and saw it through without exemption."  
"遗憾，我有过一些，" 她轻声哼唱，凭着记忆。毕竟，这是玛丽最喜欢的歌曲之一。"但再怎么说，也寥寥无几。我做了…我必须做的事，毫无例外地坚持到底。"

She turned back, but not before glancing at the seedling one last time. Viko sang along, loud enough to be heard over at the housing district. It pained Asuka to admit that his voice was not unpleasant, nor was his rendition of the song horrible.  
她转过身去，但在那之前还是忍不住最后看了一眼那株幼苗。维克大声唱着，声音大到住宅区那边都能听见。让明日香不得不承认的是，他的嗓音并不难听，对这首歌的演绎也并不糟糕。

However, she felt no relation to the lyrics. She was yet to love, laugh or cry to her fullest. Her chest was empty, a gaping hole waiting to be filled with actual life experiences outside of war. She had not had her fill of anything, not even the idiot's food. None of it was amusing, nothing other than those days years ago, and recently, the quiet moments by the table, or the sound of the waves as they crashed ashore. A stupid, childish little grin.  
然而，她对歌词毫无共鸣。她还未曾全情投入地爱过、笑过或哭过。她的内心空空如也，一个等待着被真实生活经历填满的巨大空洞。她对任何事物都未曾感到满足，甚至连那个白痴的食物也不例外。这一切都无趣至极，除了多年前的那段时光，以及最近，那些桌子旁的静谧时刻，或是海浪拍岸的声音。一个愚蠢、幼稚的小小微笑。

Viko's voice echoed still when Asuka reached the house. A glance through the window revealed Kensuke and Shinji eating at the table, chatting amiably. Her gaze softened, shifting from misery to slight fondness.  
当明日香到达房子时，Viko 的声音仍在回响。透过窗户一瞥，看到真嗣和健介在桌旁愉快地用餐聊天。她的目光柔和下来，从痛苦转为一丝温情。

"Baka," she decided. "The Baka-Shinji Tree, then."  
“笨蛋，”她决定道，“那就叫笨蛋真嗣树吧。”

---

Dark, soulless eyes stared from across the ruins. They narrowed in discontent and the promise of retaliation.  
废墟对面，一双空洞无魂的眼睛凝视着。它们不满地眯起，预示着报复的到来。

"It was an accident," he tried to reason or bargain, to no avail. The creature neared him with rage overflowing its being. "I didn't mean to throw the ashes your way, I swear! Look, I have these four small fish, I'll give them to you. No questions asked. I know you guys help me out every day, so please."  
"那是个意外，" 他试图辩解或讨价还价，但无济于事。那生物带着满腔怒火向他逼近。"我不是故意把灰撒到你身上的，我发誓！看，我有这四条小鱼，我给你。不问任何问题。我知道你们每天都在帮我，所以请原谅我。"

Shinji bowed at the leader of the penguin waddle, who ruffled its soot-filled feathers and squeaked its annoyance further. Luckily, once he threw the fish between himself and the penguin group, they became more preoccupied with feasting than nipping at his ankles and legs. With a relieved sigh, he sat back on the box and threw the line into the water.  
真嗣向企鹅群的首领鞠了一躬，那只企鹅抖动着沾满煤灰的羽毛，发出更响亮的抱怨声。幸运的是，一旦他把鱼扔在自己和企鹅群之间，它们就忙于进食，不再啄他的脚踝和腿。他松了一口气，坐回到箱子上，把钓线抛入水中。

"Again, I'm sorry." The leader continued to throw glares while devouring his symbol of truce. "Just wanted to have everything ready, you know."  
"再次，我很抱歉。" 首领一边吞咽着他的和平象征，一边继续投以怒视。"只是想把一切都准备好，你知道的。"

Two mackerels were already cooking in his makeshift smoker. The other box and fishing rod rested next to him. It was foolish to think the nervousness coursing through him was a sign. _Doesn't hurt to be prepared, right? And in any case I can take the food back to the h-_  
两条鲭鱼已经在他的临时熏制器中烹饪。另一个箱子和钓竿靠在他旁边。认为这种紧张感是一种征兆是愚蠢的。做好准备总没错，对吧？无论如何，我可以把食物带回——

"So… you're talking to penguins, now?"  
“所以……你现在在和企鹅聊天？”

Eagerness. Surprise. Something akin to joy. They struck at once when Asuka spoke from over the walls. She walked over to the box, picked the fishing rod and sat, giving him an unamused stare. "Should I get the protein bars?"  
急切、惊讶，还有一丝类似喜悦的情绪。当明日香从墙那边说话时，这些感觉立刻涌上心头。她走过来，拿起钓竿坐下，给了他一个不悦的眼神。“我应该去拿蛋白质棒吗？”

"A-Ah, no thanks." Shinji replied with half a smile. "I was just cleaning the leftover ash and the wind picked up so… they got the worse of it."  
"啊，不用了，谢谢。" 真嗣半笑着回答，"我只是在清理剩下的灰烬，结果风一吹……它们就遭殃了。"

"You're working with the chubby little bastards? How does that work?" Asuka spoke as harshly as ever, but her pose was relaxed, more so than he had seen ever since waking up in the ship. "You better not be giving out the village's fish to them."  
"你在和那些胖乎乎的小家伙们合作？这怎么进行的？" 明日香一如既往地尖锐，但她的姿势却很放松，比他自从在船上醒来后看到的都要放松。"你最好别把村里的鱼分给他们。"

"Not really. Uhm." He pointed towards where a group of seagulls was circling near the shore. "After I'm done cleaning the catch, I throw whatever can't be used in the water. That brings smaller fish that they can eat. And so," Shinji made a circling motion with his hand. "They surround the bigger ones and bring them close to the shore, where they can see the bait. It's a convenient arrangement, I think."  
"也不完全是。呃。" 他指向一群在岸边盘旋的海鸥，"我清理完捕获物后，会把不能用的扔进水里。这样会吸引小鱼，它们可以吃。然后，" 真嗣用手做了一个环绕的动作，"它们会围住大鱼，把它们带到岸边，让它们能看到诱饵。我觉得这是个方便的安排。"

Asuka motioned towards his small pyre. "And those? Fresh catch?"  
明日香示意他那小小的火堆。“那些呢？刚捕的？”

"Yeah," he replied, not realizing how much excitement filtered through. "Right after midday. I'm waiting for them to finish cooking. There's some shiitake mushrooms, and… uhm… rice."  
“嗯，”他回答，没意识到自己语气中透出的兴奋。“中午刚捕的。我在等它们煮熟。有些香菇，还有……呃……米饭。”

"So, fish and rice." She shook her head, hair dancing lightly. "Color me surprised."  
“所以，鱼和米饭。”她摇摇头，发丝轻轻飘动。“真让我意外。”

"A-And shiitake," he lamely repeated. Too late did he realize that she had repeatedly told him that mix was boring to her. "Sorry. It's just… I mean I don't want to cook one of our friends, over there." The largest penguin squeaked in outrage. "They're so helpful, and I've never cooked penguin before."  
"A-而且香菇，" 他尴尬地重复道。太晚了他才意识到她曾多次告诉他那个搭配对她来说很无聊。"对不起。只是……我的意思是，我不想把我们的朋友，那边的，给煮了。" 最大的企鹅愤怒地叫了一声。"它们这么有用，我以前从没煮过企鹅。"

He heard it. Asuka's breath caught and she chortled at his sad attempt at a joke. She had _almost_ laughed.  
他听到了。明日香的呼吸一窒，对他的拙劣笑话轻声笑了出来。她差点就笑出声了。

"Idiot," she said. A tiny, almost imperceptible smile illuminated her features. "Leave the stupid birds be. They're endangered, after all. Meh, fish and rice is better than stale rations and water. Beggars can't be choosers."  
"笨蛋，" 她说道。一丝几乎察觉不到的微笑在她脸上闪现。"别管那些傻鸟了。它们毕竟是濒危物种。算了，鱼和米饭总比陈旧的口粮和水好。乞丐不能挑三拣四。"

"Are you hungry?" Shinji asked.  
"你饿了吗？" 真嗣问道。

"Lately, yeah. I can wait right now. It's not like I need food at the end of the day. This," she pointed at the eye-patch, "keeps me alive, even if I don't want it to."  
"最近确实有点。不过我现在可以等。反正一天结束时我也不需要食物。这个，" 她指了指眼罩，"即使我不想要，它也能让我活下去。"

_This is it,_ he thought, heart pounding. _What we were talking about last time. Shinji, take that step. Don't just sit there and do nothing like before. You'll only hurt people by doing nothing._  
就是这样，他想，心跳加速。上次我们谈论的事情。真嗣，迈出那一步。不要像以前那样只是坐在那里什么都不做。什么都不做只会伤害别人。

"How… why… uhm." He took a deep breath to settle the relentless nerves and dread. "What happened? And… was it," _Take the step._ "Was it my fault, too?"  
"怎么……为什么……呃。" 他深吸一口气，平复那无法抑制的紧张和恐惧。"发生了什么？而且……是不是，" 迈出这一步。"是不是也是我的错？"

Expecting brutal and swift retaliation, Shinji closed his eyes and waited for the well-deserved kick at his side, an elbow to his temple, or perhaps a well-aimed punch to the face. Silence. Nothing aside from the terns as they circled the shore and settled for the afternoon. Nothing but the sound of the ocean. Each second felt heavier than the next. The thought of having burned a bridge that was not yet fully built nor functioned terrified him.  
预料到会遭到残酷而迅速的报复，真嗣闭上眼睛，等待着那应得的侧踢，或是击向太阳穴的肘击，甚至是精准的一拳打在脸上。沉默。除了燕鸥在岸边盘旋并准备下午栖息的声音外，什么都没有。只有海浪的声音。每一秒都比下一秒更沉重。想到自己可能烧毁了一座尚未完全建成或运行的桥梁，他感到恐惧。

"This isn't just the curse of Eva," Asuka began, which elicited a massive sigh of relief from him. "This eye-patch. Unit 03 had already been infected by the Angel by the time it landed in Japan. The moment I stepped into the entry plug it started infecting me, as well. A fail-safe, just in case it didn't survive."  
"这不仅仅是 EVA 的诅咒，" 明日香开始说道，这让他大大松了一口气。"这个眼罩。03 号机在抵达日本时就已经被使徒感染了。我一进入插入栓，它就开始感染我，也是。一种保险措施，以防它没有存活下来。"

"I see." Shinji stared at the water, recalling the events leading to that disastrous battle. "I thought it was Rei who was the designated pilot. Did you…?"  
"我明白了。" 真嗣凝视着水面，回想起导致那场灾难性战斗的一系列事件。"我以为指定驾驶员是绫波。你……？"

"Yeah, I volunteered," said Asuka. It felt as terrible as being decked in the face. "The First was doing that stupid planning for your little dinner party with your father."  
"是的，我自愿的，" 明日香说道。那种感觉就像被人狠狠打了一拳。"第一适格者正在为你的小晚餐派对和你父亲做那愚蠢的计划。"

Shinji's shoulders slumped. "Oh. So, it _is_ my fault."  
真嗣的肩膀垂了下来。"哦。所以，这都是我的错。"

"Ugh, no it's not, you idiot!" Asuka fired back with her usual bite, making him flinch. "What did I say I blamed you for? What was the word in that little book of yours?"  
"呸，才不是，你个白痴！" 明日香一如既往地尖锐反击，让他畏缩了一下。"我责怪你的是什么？你那本小书里的词是什么？"

He rubbed at the scar by his wrist nervously. "Inaction."  
他紧张地揉着腕上的伤疤。"不作为。"

"Exactly! We already went over that. Now try to make your bratty brain understand _this_ new concept." Growling with each word, Asuka's eye gleamed with fury. "The parasite here was out of your control, one way or the other. I volunteered. I'm a pilot, it's the only thing I've ever known, ever been good at. It was _my_ choice. Got it?"  
"没错！我们已经讨论过了。现在试着让你的小屁孩大脑理解这个新概念。" 明日香每说一个字都带着怒气，眼中闪烁着愤怒的光芒。"这里的寄生虫，不管怎样，都不在你的控制之下。是我自愿的。我是个驾驶员，这是我唯一知道的事，也是我唯一擅长的事。这是我自己的选择。明白了吗？"

Recoiling even further, Shinji nodded his understanding and waited until Asuka sat back down. Once she did, he managed to breathe again. Her words were absolute and immeasurably heavy, and yet they did not make him feel any better. His resolve only solidified with each small exchange they shared, or with each time Ms. Lookalike asked if he had come up with a name.  
再次后退，真嗣点头表示理解，等待着明日香重新坐下。她一坐下，他才得以再次呼吸。她的话语绝对且无比沉重，然而这并未让他感觉好些。每一次小小的交流，或是每次像那位长相相似的女士询问他是否想出了名字，都让他的决心更加坚定。

"Yeah, I think I understand," he paused. The scent of cooked fish began to filter through. "Thank you… for telling me. I'm sorry I didn't do more. I should've tried harder, even if it made no difference in the end."  
“嗯，我想我明白了，”他停顿了一下。烹饪的鱼香味开始飘散。“谢谢你……告诉我。对不起，我没有做得更多。我本应该更努力尝试，即使最终没有改变什么。”

"Whatever. Things happened either way, regardless of how hard you tried. Well..." Her voice turned bitter, and slightly cold. "You did try super hard to save the First, didn't you?"  
“随便吧。无论如何，事情总会发生，不管你多么努力。好吧……”她的声音变得苦涩，略带冷意。“你确实非常努力地想要拯救初号机，不是吗？”

The memory stung just like the Angel's tendril as it slashed away Unit 01's arm. It was still so fresh in his mind, just like Kaworu's demise. "I was so tired of losing people I cared about." The words spilled from his mouth without consent. "I couldn't bear the thought of losing Rei like I thought I lost you. I forgot about everything else, I just… wanted to save one person I cared about, just _once_."  
记忆如天使的触手般刺痛，正如它斩断初号机手臂的那一刻。那一切在他脑海中依旧鲜明，宛如渚薰的消逝。“我厌倦了失去我在乎的人。”这些话未经允许便脱口而出。“我无法忍受像以为失去你那样失去绫波。我忘记了其他一切，我只是……想救一个我在乎的人，哪怕只有一次。”

"A person you cared about, huh," Asuka echoed. "Well, you certainly cracked the world in half in that one. Not that your father wasn't going to finish breaking it anyways, with or without you."  
“一个你在乎的人，是吧，”明日香重复道。“好吧，你确实在那次把世界劈成了两半。不过，不管有没有你，你父亲反正也会把它彻底摧毁。”

"Do you think she's still in there, in Unit 01?"  
“你觉得她还在初号机里吗？”

Asuka shrugged again, turning to look over at the mackerels. "Who knows. Probably. We found _you_ in there, didn't we? And Ritsuko droned on and on about how you were nothing but yellow sludge." She retrieved the line, and placed the fishing rod next to the box, stretching. "Enough of that crap. Plenty of time to discuss pointless ideas another day. I see you pulled through with the cooking out here, huh."  
明日香又耸了耸肩，转头看向鲭鱼。“谁知道呢。大概吧。我们不是在那儿找到你的吗？而且律子还喋喋不休地说你不过是黄色的烂泥。”她收起钓线，把钓竿放在箱子旁边，伸了个懒腰。“别提那些废话了。改天再讨论这些没意义的念头吧。看来你在外面做饭还挺有一套的，嗯？”

Relieved that instead of closing herself off like he expected, Asuka had instead changed the subject and inquired about the food, Shinji explained as best he could how it had taken several tries until he found the proper place and method to give the fish some type of flavor that was not charcoal.  
庆幸的是，明日香并没有像他预想的那样封闭自己，而是换了话题，询问起食物来。真嗣尽可能详细地解释，他尝试了好几次才找到合适的方法和位置，让鱼肉有了些许非炭味的滋味。

They spoke very little, choosing instead to sit by the smoldering cinders. Still, they remained until the first stars glistened above. The silence was comfortable, welcoming, and company always made a meal taste all the better.  
他们没怎么说话，而是选择坐在余烬旁。尽管如此，他们一直待到第一颗星星在夜空中闪烁。沉默是舒适的，令人感到亲切，有伴相随总能让一顿饭更加美味。

That night, just as every time, he asked whether the meal had sufficed.  
那一夜，正如每一次，他询问晚餐是否足够。

"It was good," Asuka replied. "Have more food ready next time, this was too light a meal. And bring that clone around. She can have those mushrooms or whatever."  
“还不错，”明日香回答，“下次多准备些，这次太清淡了。还有，把那个克隆人叫来，她可以吃那些蘑菇什么的。”

Once they settled in for the night, Shinji went over the dictionary and underlined another word with the red marker. He began to draw the pirate roundel from memory. It felt natural to draw the blue one next to it. "Hope," he whispered.  
"他们安顿下来过夜后，真嗣翻开字典，用红笔又划出了一个单词。他开始凭记忆画出海盗徽章。自然而然地，他在旁边画上了蓝色的那个。“希望，”他低语道。

"A feeling of expectation… and desire for a certain thing to happen."  
"一种期待感……以及对某件事发生的渴望。"

_**To Be Continued…  未完待续……**_

### Chapter 7 Jammin Chapter
The wind currents were so strong that tainted sand covered everything in sight.  
风力如此强劲，污染的沙尘覆盖了视线所及的一切。

A storm. Not even a terrible one according to the village commander, and still he could barely move with the air practically slicing through his vest. Thunder blared in the distance, resonating through the helmet. Breathing was difficult. Rain had turned dirt into hardening mud, so his feet got caught up in the red sludge again and again.  
一场风暴。甚至算不上村指挥官口中的恶劣天气，但他仍几乎无法动弹，仿佛空气正割裂着他的背心。远处的雷声轰鸣，透过头盔回荡。呼吸变得困难。雨水将泥土变成了硬泥，他的双脚一次又一次陷入红色的泥泞中。

Behind him, two Wanderers walked. Undeterred by the harsh weather, they moved towards the village.  
在他身后，两名流浪者行走着。他们不受恶劣天气的影响，向村庄进发。

_They look for encampments, drawn to life,_ he recalled the blonde's voice the night before. _Once they reach them, well… nothing but dust and them remains._  
他们寻找营地，被生命所吸引，他回想起昨晚金发男子的话。一旦他们到达那里，好吧……只剩下尘埃和他们自己。

"Torment," he whispered. The figures moved from within the apparition's body, writhing in pain. How come only he and Asuka ever saw them? "To cause severe, persistent or recurrent distress. A source of vexation or pain." Asuka's eyepatch flashed in his mind. "Extreme anguish of body or mind."  
“折磨，”他低语道。那些身影从幻影体内移动出来，痛苦地扭动着。为何只有他和明日香能看到它们？“引起剧烈、持续或反复的痛苦。烦恼或痛苦的根源。”明日香的眼罩在他脑海中一闪而过。“身心极度的痛苦。”

"Huh?" Kensuke turned to him. He almost had to scream to get words across through the wind and the rumbling in the sky. "Did you say something?"  
“啊？”健介转头看向他。他几乎得大喊才能在风声和天空的轰鸣中让对方听到自己的话。“你刚才说什么了吗？”

"Nothing," Shinji answered. He pointed towards what looked like the remains of a small warehouse. The top of the old ceiling rattled with the storm. "Should we look over there?"  
“没什么，”真嗣回答。他指向一处看似小仓库废墟的地方。旧屋顶在风暴中颤动。“我们要不要去那边看看？”

Nodding in his direction, the commander set out to investigate. He followed as quick as the suit allowed. The Wanderers never left his line of sight; the wrenching and crying of all those entrapped in the monsters was almost as loud as the wind.  
指挥官朝他点了点头，随即展开调查。他尽可能快地跟在后面，流浪者们始终没有离开他的视线；那些被困在怪物中的哭喊声几乎和风声一样响亮。

Once inside, both laid back against the concrete walls. Sweat dripped down Shinji's face, the helmet's visor blurring under his condensing breaths. Footsteps shook the earth as they drew away and soon, only the sound of their labored pants remained. The warehouse was bigger than he had initially thought, with many metal cases and containers piled atop one another.  
一进到里面，两人便靠在混凝土墙上休息。汗水从真嗣的脸上滴落，头盔面罩因他的呼吸而变得模糊。脚步声震动了地面，逐渐远去，不久只剩下他们沉重的喘息声。仓库比他最初想象的要大得多，许多金属箱子和集装箱堆叠在一起。

So much to search through, so much to do still.  
还有这么多要搜寻，这么多事情要做。

Kensuke wasted no time in pushing one of the nearest containers to the side and inspecting the many spare parts that cascaded to the ground. Quick handed, he scrutinized the rubble with the lamp, pocketing small pieces of metal, cable, or whatever else could be salvaged.  
健介毫不犹豫地将最近的一个集装箱推到一边，检查着散落一地的众多备用零件。他动作迅速，用手电筒仔细审视着废墟，将小块金属、电缆或其他任何可回收的物品收入口袋。

_Bring a little goodness into the world,_ Shinji's mind repeated. His hand gripped at the shelves without knowing what he was supposed to find. Kensuke had instructed 'anything that looks salvageable' could be collected.  
给世界带来一点善意，真嗣的脑海中反复回响着这句话。他的手紧握着货架，却不知道自己应该寻找什么。健介曾指示，任何看起来可回收的东西都可以收集。

"How am I supposed to know what works and what doesn't, thou-" The box he had been holding disintegrated into brown dust. "Oh."  
“我怎么知道哪些能用哪些不能用，你——”他手中的盒子突然化为一堆棕色尘埃。“哦。”

"What do you think I should get Junior?" asked Kensuke, and flung another broken transistor behind his shoulder. "He's been a little serious lately. I think having his application rejected really pissed him off."  
"你觉得我该给小家伙买点什么？" 健介问道，随手又将一个坏掉的晶体管扔到身后。"他最近有点严肃。我想他的申请被拒真的让他很恼火。"

"_You all suck,"_ Ryoji muttered in Shinji's mind, drawing a small smile. If anything, the young Katsuragi seemed more annoyed than upset.  
"你们都太逊了，" 绫人在真嗣的脑海中低声抱怨，引得他微微一笑。尽管如此，年轻的葛城看起来更多的是恼怒而非伤心。"

"He probably just wants to see Misato," Shinji suggested, examining a rusted lighter. It ignited after four tries, so he pocketed it in the suit. His shoulders slumped. "If it weren't for me, he wouldn't have to wonder who his mom is."  
"他可能只是想见见美里，" 真嗣建议道，检查着一个生锈的打火机。试了四次后终于点燃了，于是他把它放进了衣服口袋。他的肩膀垂了下来。"如果不是因为我，他也不必去猜测自己的妈妈是谁。"

The commander dove into the next box. "Well, that still doesn't answer my question," he half-yelled. "I can't give him the car! Can't approve his application without Viko slitting my throat at night, can't even find something that reminds him of Misato or Kaji!"  
指挥官一头扎进下一个箱子。“好吧，这还是没回答我的问题，”他半喊着说。“我不能把车给他！没有 Viko 晚上割我喉咙的许可，我连他的申请都批不了，更别说找什么能让他想起美里或加持的东西了！”

Shinji's head perked in surprise. "Huh? How come?"  
真嗣的头惊讶地竖了起来。“啊？为什么？”

"Don't really know 'em!" Kensuke replied, and threw a broken battery to the side. "I mean, I've spoken to the Captain a number of times, we met that time years ago when we went to the aquarium, but nothing other than the bare minimum!"  
“其实不太了解他们！” 健介回答道，并把一个坏掉的电池扔到一边。“我是说，我和队长聊过几次，几年前我们去水族馆的时候见过一次，但也就仅此而已！”

"Oh." Memories of that day flooded in an instant. Rei's compliment on his food, the laughter and banter of his friends. Asuka, staring at the game console and occasionally glaring his way. "I guess I had the chance to know them a little."  
"哦。" 那天的记忆瞬间涌入脑海。丽对他做的食物的称赞，朋友们的欢笑和调侃。明日香，盯着游戏机，偶尔向他投来锐利的目光。"我想我有机会稍微了解他们一些。"

They worked in silence thereafter, only communicating to ponder on how salvageable this or that was. _Wither,_ yet another piece of crusted metal turned to fine dust in his hands. _To cease to flourish. To fall into decay or decline._ He was about to haul a round object over his head when its form gave him pause.  
之后他们默默工作，仅在思考某物是否还有救时交流。枯萎，又一片锈蚀的金属在他手中化为细尘。停止生长。陷入衰退或衰败。他正要举起一个圆形物体时，其形状让他停顿了一下。

"Uhm, Kensuke?" Shinji's voice barely reached the man under the heavy wind. "What is this?"  
"呃，肯斯克？" 真嗣的声音在强劲的风中几乎传不到那人耳中。"这是什么？"

No footsteps registered, the storm was picking up. "Oh, look at that! A potter's wheel, and it looks like it still works. Hah! That's crazy, everything else in here is poofing out of existence, and this of all things survives."  
"没有脚步声，风暴正在加剧。“哦，看那个！一个陶轮，看起来还能用。哈！太疯狂了，这里其他东西都在消失，而这个居然幸存下来。”

"A pottery wheel?" Shinji repeated, and heard Asuka's voice call him an idiot for doing so. "Sorry, I thought it might be something useful."  
“陶轮？”真嗣重复道，听到明日香的声音在骂他傻。“抱歉，我以为它可能有用。”

"Who says it isn't?" Kensuke countered. The device was heavy, it required them both carrying it to the warehouse door. "Lots of things can be made from clay! The forge master can teach you how to use it. There's always need for cups, pots, containers, all sorts of things. And," Kensuke nudged at Shinji's arm with a sly smirk. "You can also make personalized gifts!"  
“谁说它没用？”健介反驳道。这设备很重，他们俩一起才把它搬到仓库门口。“很多东西都可以用黏土做！锻造师傅可以教你如何使用它。总是需要杯子、罐子、容器等各种东西。而且，”健介狡黠地笑着碰了碰真嗣的手臂。“你还可以做个性化的礼物！”

It felt stupid to carry the piece all the way to the car. Kensuke had already decided to gift Ryoji a radio and found the needed parts to manufacture it. What was he supposed to do with an old pottery device?  
带着那件东西一路走到车旁，感觉真是愚蠢。健介已经决定送给凌二一台收音机，并找到了制造所需的零件。他该拿这个旧陶器设备怎么办呢？

"Lots of clay deposits near the house," Kensuke mentioned once they were in the car, struggling to get back to the village. The storm raged more heavily than before, with droplets of crimson rain splashing on the windshield. "I'll teach you how to shape the basic stuff, how's that sound? You told me you wanted to fill that gap between midday and sunset, right?"  
“房子附近有很多黏土沉积，”健介在他们艰难返回村庄的车里提到，外面的风暴比之前更加猛烈，猩红的雨滴溅在挡风玻璃上。“我会教你如何塑造基本的东西，听起来怎么样？你说过你想填补中午到日落之间的空白，对吧？”

A pirate skull, smirking at the adversities and battles yet to face. Strong, valorous, dignified. Could his hands produce something that conveyed those feelings?  
一个海盗骷髅头，对着即将面对的逆境和战斗咧嘴而笑。坚强、勇敢、庄重。他的双手能创造出传达这些情感的作品吗？

_Build,_ he recalled, eyes lost in the dark skies and heavy rain. _To form by ordering and uniting materials by gradual means into a_ _composite__**whole.**_ _Step by step. Earn._"Thank you," Shinji uttered. He reached for the portions Asuka had placed in the car. "I'll do my best."  
建造，他回忆着，目光迷失在黑暗的天空和滂沱大雨中。通过逐步有序地组合和统一材料，形成一个复合整体。一步一步。努力。“谢谢你，”真嗣低声说道。他伸手去拿明日香放在车里的便当。“我会尽力的。”

The bento was waiting on the table just as it had for the past few weeks.  
便当一如既往地摆在桌上，就像过去几周一样。

She collapsed on the seat, tired despite having done nothing during the day. Her eye drifted to the door. Still no sign of either male. Rain was thundering on the roof, unrelenting since the morning, and muted out the handheld. The routine of staring at the screen was breaking; Asuka no longer wanted to play the same stupid game, whereas the Major was content with ignoring the world further.  
她瘫坐在座位上，尽管一整天什么也没做，却感到疲惫不堪。她的目光飘向门口。两个男生依然不见踪影。雨从早上开始就无情地敲打着屋顶，淹没了手持设备的声响。盯着屏幕的日常正在瓦解；明日香不再想玩那愚蠢的游戏，而美里则满足于进一步忽视这个世界。

"Stupid game," she muttered to the empty room. "Stupid weather. Stupid Kenken, risking his neck out there for Misato's spawn." A frown drew on her features while unpacking the food. "Putting the brat at risk."  
"愚蠢的游戏，"她对着空荡荡的房间喃喃自语。"愚蠢的天气。愚蠢的 Kenken，为了 Misato 的孩子冒着生命危险。"她一边拆开食物一边皱起眉头。"让那孩子处于危险之中。"

True to his word and her demands, Shinji had acquired the sausages and cooked the strange lemon reduction as a sauce to dip them in. No sesame seeds in sight. The flavor was mellow, yet sweet enough to contrast the strong aftertaste of the sausage. No burnt corners anywhere, no raw rice as days before. With every meal he prepared, Shinji Ikari peeked through the brat's fearful gaze.  
正如他所承诺和她的要求，真嗣买来了香肠，并按照指示烹饪了奇特的柠檬酱作为蘸料。没有芝麻的踪影。味道柔和，却足够甜美，与香肠的强烈余味形成对比。没有烧焦的边角，也没有像前几天那样的生米。每一顿饭，真嗣都透过那孩子的恐惧目光窥视着。

Her stomach grumbled as she paused, lost in thought. The image from school was manifesting often, getting on her nerves. The dumb, shaky little smile. A hand gingerly holding onto the box, carefully wrapped in a handkerchief. The same hands she had bound in manacles, the wrist she had injured.  
她停下脚步，陷入沉思，肚子咕咕作响。学校里的那幅画面时常浮现，让她心烦意乱。那愚蠢、颤抖的小小微笑。一只手小心翼翼地捧着盒子，用一块手帕仔细包裹着。正是那双手，她曾用镣铐束缚，那手腕她曾伤害过。

"Idiot," Asuka grumbled. Despite being hungry, something held her from emptying the bento. How many of those were left before the little vacation ended, and the war carried on? "You should've stayed dead, or dissolved or whatever. Should've never come back."  
"白痴，" 明日香咕哝着。尽管肚子饿，某种东西却让她无法清空便当盒。这个小假期结束前还剩多少个这样的便当，战争又要继续了？"你本该死透的，或者溶解掉什么的。根本不该回来。"

The words were the antithesis of her meal; bitter, stale and ridden with deceit. Asuka wanted to spit, but it would have meant parting with the sweet-sour taste of the sauce. How long did she have? How long ago had food begun to taste so good again?  
这些话与她的餐食截然相反；苦涩、陈腐且充满欺骗。明日香想吐出来，但这意味着要放弃那酸甜酱汁的美妙滋味。她还有多久？食物是从何时开始再次变得如此美味的？

_How long has it been since I woke up eager for anything?_ she thought with a bitter scowl. Another demure bite, barely a nibble. _And these pathetic attempts are supposed to be… what? What does it matter?_  
我有多久没有醒来时对任何事充满期待了？她苦涩地皱眉思索。又是一小口，几乎只是轻咬。这些可悲的尝试又算什么呢？有什么意义？

Misery unlike anything she had felt in recent time began to crawl in her chest. Her hand hovered over the bento, fingers tightening on the fork. He even bothered to get her a fork. _Treasure,_ she mused. _A collection of precious things._  
一种久违的痛苦开始在她的胸中蔓延。她的手悬在便当上方，手指紧紧握住叉子。他甚至还特意为她准备了叉子。珍宝，她暗想。一系列珍贵之物。

Asuka ate slowly, ignoring the Major's remarks and the Wonderswan. Even as the food cooled, it did not lose taste. Her eye went over to Shinji's corner, where the dictionary sat atop her jacket. _Something of great worth or value._ She threw the stupid hat he was so fond of next to his pillow.  
明日香慢慢地吃着，不理会少校的评论和那台 Wonderswan 游戏机。即使食物变凉了，味道依旧未减。她的目光扫向真嗣的角落，那里她的外套上放着那本字典。某种极其珍贵或有价值的东西。她把那顶他钟爱的愚蠢帽子扔到了他的枕边。

"Someone important to you," she said. "Remember me then, Idiot."  
“对你重要的人，”她说道，“那时记得我，傻瓜。”

---

Kensuke laughed wholeheartedly when Asuka finished berating them. Soaked, stinking, and loaded with what she described as useless crap, the pair made for a poor sight once they returned.  
当明日香训斥完他们后，真希典放声大笑。浑身湿透，臭气熏天，还带着她所说的无用垃圾，两人回来时的样子实在狼狈。

Shinji had hurried off to the car the moment the girl's glare had descended upon him, then jogged over to the kitchen area after a hasty shower. Not an hour had passed and food was already sizzling on his stove. Asuka sat at the table, impatient, and threw the occasional glance at her prisoner.  
真嗣一感受到女孩的目光就急忙跑向车子，然后匆匆洗了个澡，又赶往厨房区域。不到一小时，他的炉子上已经飘出了食物的香味。明日香坐在桌前，不耐烦地偶尔瞥一眼她的“俘虏”。

_Making sure I brought him back in one piece, I bet,_ Kensuke thought. He fit the transistor and batteries into the makeshift radio while dinner was prepared, and pretended not to notice Asuka's annoyance. _Can it be that at some point, you started enjoying his company, Major? Don't feel like sharing your 'prisoner' with anybody, do you? Not after all the leaps and bounds you've both made ever since you two came here._  
我敢打赌，你肯定确保我把他完好无损地带回来了，真希典心想。他在准备晚餐的同时，将晶体管和电池装进临时制作的收音机里，假装没注意到明日香的不悦。少校，是不是有那么一刻，你开始享受他的陪伴了？不想和任何人分享你的‘俘虏’，对吧？自从你们俩来到这里，经历了那么多飞跃和进步之后。

"Like a radio will be any good in this wasteland," Asuka commented from the table. "What station is the brat supposed to listen to? Interference PM? Nothingness on the noon, with your special guest, desolation."  
“在这种荒原上，收音机有什么用，”明日香从桌边评论道。“那小子能听什么台？干扰下午档？中午的虚无时刻，特别嘉宾是荒凉。”

He laughed, surprised to hear Shinji chuckle as well. "It's more of an old-fashioned cassette player. You know how those two like their music and their singing."  
他笑了，惊讶地听到真嗣也跟着笑了起来。“更像是个老式的磁带播放器。你知道他们俩喜欢音乐和唱歌。”

"With terrible accents that scare away the critters," Asuka added. "Pair of deranged banshees. They deserve each other. And now you're giving him something to be even louder. Great."  
“带着能把小动物吓跑的糟糕口音，”明日香补充道。“一对疯癫的妖精。他们真是天生一对。现在你还要给他东西让他更大声。太好了。”

More laughter bounced off the wooden walls. Kensuke did not miss how Asuka turned to ensure Shinji had chortled at her remark. _I'd say you even blushed a little there, oh great Major Shikinami, soldier extraordinaire._  
更多的笑声在木墙间回荡。 Kensuke 没有错过 Asuka 转身确认 Shinji 是否因她的评论而笑出声的那一刻。我得说，伟大的式波少校，士兵中的佼佼者，你当时甚至有点脸红了吧。

"Hey, Viko was thinking of giving the kid his guitar, imagine that!" he countered. "They'll be serenading the fields on a daily basis!"  
“嘿，Viko 正考虑把吉他送给那孩子，想象一下！”他反驳道，“他们每天都要在田野上唱情歌了！”

It had been too long since the walls of his house had been filled with senseless banter, jokes, and tranquility. Kensuke watched Asuka eat that night, watched how she stalled, complained or argued to extend the meal as long as possible. Once or twice her eye drifted to the plate, as if to ensure there was still enough. She had once told him of a timer running permanently in her mind.  
自从他的房子里再次充满无意义的闲聊、笑话和宁静以来，已经过去太久了。那晚，Kensuke 观察着 Asuka 吃饭，看着她如何拖延、抱怨或争论，只为尽可能延长用餐时间。一两次，她的目光飘向盘子，仿佛在确认还有足够的饭菜。她曾告诉他，她的脑海中有一个永不停歇的计时器。

Kensuke's gaze became somber as he stared at his own plate. _What is it you say all the time? Doesn't matter. Tonight, it doesn't. The Impacts, the Wanderers, the future, the battles yet to face. The pain. Tonight, we can just sit back and enjoy._  
健介的目光变得沉重，他盯着面前的盘子。你总是说什么来着？无所谓了。今晚，无所谓。冲击，流浪者，未来，尚未面对的战斗。痛苦。今晚，我们可以只是坐下来享受。

Asuka called Shinji an idiot over four times, repeated how foolish it had been to bring the pottery wheel, how much of a labor it was to get clay, and how much time it required to create anything. Kensuke's smile lessened. He noticed the hat lying on Shinji's blankets, the way the dictionary was in a different position. A week before, she had always placed everything exactly the way it had been.  
明日香多次称真嗣为白痴，反复强调带陶轮是多么愚蠢，获取黏土有多费力，以及制作任何东西需要多少时间。健介的笑容减少了。他注意到真嗣的毯子上放着的帽子，字典的位置也变了。一周前，她总是把所有东西放得整整齐齐。

"Maybe you two can take a little time to work on the clay in the afternoons," Kensuke offered after dinner. "I'll have Koga come over and teach you the basics."  
“也许你们俩可以在下午花点时间做黏土，”晚餐后健介提议道，“我会让古贺过来教你们基础。”

"I'm not getting my hands filthy with mud," Asuka retorted, and walked back to the room after glaring at Shinji one last time. "What's the idiot supposed to make? Some clay penguin for Misato's brat? Tsk."  
"我才不会把手弄得满是泥巴呢，" 明日香反驳道，瞪了真嗣最后一眼后走回了房间。"那傻瓜能做什么？给美里的小鬼做个泥塑企鹅吗？啧。"

"Five," he whispered. _Five times you use that pet name in one night._ Kensuke's shoulder slackened further. Hope was wonderful.  
"五次，" 他低声说道。一晚上你用了那个昵称五次。健介的肩膀更加松弛了。希望真是美妙。

Shinji's eyes had lit up at Asuka's idea. He furiously read through the dictionary later that night, scribbling and marking definitions he thought would help the new endeavor. Exhaustion quickly won the battle, however, and his head lolled on the book sheets.  
真嗣听到明日香的主意时眼睛一亮。当晚他疯狂地翻阅着字典，边写边标记他认为对新计划有帮助的定义。然而，疲惫很快占了上风，他的头垂在了书页上。

Collapsing in his own blankets felt heavenly after a day going through rubble and acid rain was heavenly. Some brightness reflected in Kensuke's eye, making him shift before sleep claimed him. The moonlight was shimmering against the blue and white roundel. Steps echoed through the floor, so he feigned sleep and watched in silence.  
在废墟和酸雨中度过一天后，蜷缩在自己的毯子里感觉无比舒适。一丝光芒映入 Kensuke 的眼中，使他在入睡之前微微挪动。月光在蓝白相间的圆徽上闪烁。脚步声在地板上回响，于是他假装睡着，静静地观察着。

"Could've at least said thanks," Asuka whispered. "Guess it's too much to ask, huh. Idiot."  
“至少可以说声谢谢吧，”Asuka 低声说道，“看来要求太高了，哼。笨蛋。”

_He does, every day,_ thought the village chief, nodding off_. With the bentos, the fish. The little kitchen he built for you_. _It's nice to see you say it back, though._  
他每天都这么做，村长想着，渐渐入睡。带着便当，鱼。还有为你建的小厨房。不过，能看到你回应，真是太好了。

"Hah! Finally! Look at this beauty!"  
"哈哈！终于！看看这杰作！"

Ryoji held the malformed 'cup' on his palm, beaming. Granted, it was by far the best effort either had produced in days, yet still far from usable. The forge master laughed, and despite the piece being useless, placed it in the oven for the firing process.  
凌司将那畸形'杯子'托在掌心，笑容满面。诚然，这是多日来两人中做出的最好作品，但仍远未达到可用标准。锻造大师大笑着，尽管这件作品毫无用处，他还是将其放入炉中进行烧制。

"And alas, your great dexterity fails you for once, Ikari," Kaji said. A playful grin danced on his features for the first time since the request to join the WUNDER had been denied. "What are you trying to make, anyway?"  
"而你的灵巧终于也有失手的时候，一蹴，" 戒司说道。自从加入 WUNDER 的请求被拒绝后，他脸上第一次浮现出顽皮的笑容。"你到底想做什么呢？"

"I-It's a secret!" Shinji responded. He tried in vain to shield his latest attempt at a sake cup from the other boy's prying eyes. "You already had your time on the wheel, you know."  
"我——这是秘密！" 真嗣回答道。他徒劳地试图遮挡住自己最新尝试制作的酒杯，不让另一个男孩窥探。"你已经轮过一次了，你知道的。"

"Fine, be that way. Jeez, everybody's acting so weird!" Ryoji said, and fell on the grass next to Shinji. "It's just my birthday. I don't get what all the fuss is about."  
"好吧，随你便。天哪，大家的行为都好奇怪！" 莲司说着，倒在真嗣旁边的草地上。"只是我的生日而已。我不明白为什么这么大惊小怪。"

Refocusing on the mass of clay in his hands, Shinji's mind drifted to the villagers. Everybody was working, either in secret or openly, to make the most memorable party yet. He recalled sitting by the Horaki family as they celebrated once, still too shell-shocked to partake in the festivities.  
重新专注于手中的陶土，真嗣的思绪飘向了村民们。每个人都在秘密或公开地努力，希望能举办一场最难忘的派对。他回想起曾坐在堀木一家旁边，看着他们庆祝，自己却因过于震惊而无法参与其中。

His hand slipped over the shape again when the red roundel came to mind. The cap was still on his blankets, precisely in the place he had found it. _I don't know what to do,_ his mind repeated while his fingers tried to mold a clay bird into life. _Am I running away, filling up my day with stuff? I really want to talk to her again._  
当红色的圆徽浮现心头，他的手再次滑过那个形状。帽子仍在他毯子上，正好在他发现它的地方。我不知道该怎么办，他的思绪反复着，而他的手指试图将黏土捏成一只活生生的鸟。我是在逃避吗，用琐事填满我的日子？我真的想再和她谈谈。

Shinji's heartbeat doubled while the skin of his cheeks heated up. He had felt something similar before, what to him felt like months and was closer to decades. Eagerness mixed with fear and hesitation. Hikari's words ringing in the back of his head, dispelling his former thoughts. Why was the cap on his blankets?  
真嗣的心跳加速，脸颊的皮肤也热了起来。他曾有过类似的感觉，对他来说仿佛是几个月，实际上更接近几十年。急切混杂着恐惧和犹豫。光子的声音在他脑海中回响，驱散了他之前的思绪。为什么帽子会在他的毯子上？

"Your face is red, and it's not the sun like you said yesterday," Ryoji mentioned, snickering. "You're thinking about the Major, aren't you?"  
“你的脸红了，而且不像你昨天说的那样是因为太阳，”阿薰打趣道，轻声笑着。“你在想美里小姐，对吧？”

"No!" The blush became more apparent.  
"不！" 脸红变得更加明显。

"Hm, then are you thinking about Ms. Lookalike?"  
"嗯，那你是在想那位长得像她的女士吗？"

"What? No!" "什么？不是！"

"So it _is_ the Major, right?"  
"果然是真嗣，对吧？"

"What does it matter, anyway?" Shinji countered in clear desperation. Some days had already gone by without Asuka coming to the shore. "It's nothing. Asuka hates me."  
"反正也没什么关系吧？" 真嗣带着明显的绝望反驳道。已经好几天了，明日香都没有来过湖边。"没什么的。明日香讨厌我。"

"Empty words," Ryoji said. "Viko hates those. Aren't you tired of saying that lie? Just admit that, you know…" The boy nudged Shinji's ribcage with his elbow, grinning like his mother once had. "Just admit it, and everything will be easier."  
"空话而已，" 良治说。"维克讨厌这些。你难道不厌倦说这种谎吗？就承认吧，你知道的……" 男孩用肘轻轻碰了碰真嗣的肋骨，咧嘴笑着，就像他母亲曾经那样。"承认了，一切都会变得简单。"

Ms. Lookalike had suggested something of that nature the day before, making Shinji more uncomfortable. He never realized what his hands were working on. Asuka had gone so far as to attempt her own version of humor at dinner. Most people smiled when they tasted his dishes lately, Ms. Lookalike key among them, and complemented the taste.  
前一天，像样小姐就提过类似的事情，让真嗣更加不自在。他从未意识到自己的双手在忙些什么。明日香甚至尝试在晚餐时开自己的玩笑。最近，大多数人尝到他的料理时都会微笑，像样小姐尤为如此，并称赞味道。

Watching Asuka savor every bite was almost hypnotic. She didn't smile like the others. Instead, a frown would draw on her features, she'd glare at the bento in deep concentration, as if trying to remember what the flavors were supposed to be. The deeper the glare, the better the taste had been.  
看着明日香细细品味每一口，几乎有种催眠的感觉。她不像其他人那样微笑。相反，她的眉头会紧锁，凝视着便当，深思熟虑，仿佛试图回忆味道本应如何。眉头皱得越深，味道就越好。

_With the curse, I'll be able to see her frown at the food for longer,_ he thought. His eyes drifted to the barrier. A battle was brewing, one that would determine the rest of his penance, and whether he'd be able to spend more time at the village once it all ended. _Only there won't be a village to work in, if my father wins._  
有了这诅咒，我就能更久地看到她对食物皱眉，他想。他的目光飘向屏障。一场战斗正在酝酿，这将决定他余下的赎罪，以及一切结束后他是否能在村庄多待些时间。只是，如果我父亲赢了，就不会有村庄可工作了。

"Wow," the boy's voice snapped him awake. "That looks very good, Shinji. Better than mine, for sure."  
“哇，”男孩的声音将他唤醒。“看起来很不错，真嗣。肯定比我的好。”

"And up in the oven they go!" Koga stole the two pieces before Shinji could see what he had created. "You kids catch on quick! Great work today! Now get outta here and get some food in those bellies!"  
“然后进烤箱！”Koga 在真嗣看到他做了什么之前抢走了那两块。“你们学得真快！今天干得漂亮！现在快去吃点东西填饱肚子吧！”

The teens said their goodbyes to the forge workers and made their way to the small forest. Shinji's bag was heavier with both sausages and vegetables provided by the forge master in payment for his 'help'.  
少年们向锻造工们道别，前往小森林。真嗣的包里装着锻造师傅作为“帮忙”报酬给的香肠和蔬菜，感觉更沉了。

"I don't know why Mr. Koga gave us food," Shinji said once they reached one of the clearings. "He's the one teaching us."  
"我不知道为什么古贺先生会给我们食物，" 他们到达其中一个空地时，真嗣说道，"他才是教我们的人。"

"You have two mouths to feed, and I have to remind Viko he needs to eat in order to stay alive," Ryoji replied. "Mr. Koga knows what it's like to go hungry, you know. So he makes sure everybody gets their fill. Like you."  
"你有两张嘴要喂，我还得提醒维科他需要吃饭才能活下去，" 亮司回答，"古贺先生知道挨饿是什么滋味，你知道的。所以他确保每个人都能吃饱，就像你一样。"

"You've been helping everyone from the moment you could walk," Shinji said. The smell of fresh soil welcomed him, easing his nerves. He still had not asked about the hat, after all. "I'm just trying to catch up, I guess. There's so much to do."  
"你从会走路的那一刻起就在帮助大家了，" 真嗣说。新鲜的泥土气息欢迎着他，缓解了他的紧张情绪。毕竟，他还没有问起那顶帽子的事。"我想我只是想赶上进度吧。有太多事情要做。"

"Yeah, but there will be enough time for that."  
"是啊，但时间总是够的。"

Ryoji's response made him pause. "Do you think so?" Shinji asked.  
莲二的回答让他顿了一下。“你这么认为吗？”真嗣问道。

"Of course!" Ryoji pointed at the largest tree in the forest. "Step by step. But never forget to sit back and enjoy the little things."  
"当然！"莲二指向森林中最大的树。"一步一步来。但永远别忘了坐下来享受那些小事。"

"But…" Shinji's gaze shifted to the seedlings, to the Idiot tree growing ever so slowly. "What if there's no time left? What if I still don't know what to do?"  
"但是……" 真嗣的目光转向了幼苗，转向那棵缓慢生长的笨蛋树。"如果时间不够了呢？如果我还是不知道该怎么做？"

"Doesn't matter, we believe in you. When the time comes, you'll know."  
"没关系，我们相信你。到时候，你会知道的。"

The memory of everything his selfishness had brought upon returned with a vengeance. "And if what I choose hurts everyone again?"  
所有因他的自私而带来的后果的记忆如潮水般涌回。"如果我选择的结果再次伤害了大家呢？"

"What if my mother never left me here?" Ryoji wondered aloud, eyes lost in the sky. "What if my father never died, what if Gendo Ikari never lived and Third Impact never happened?" He chuckled and shook his head. "Then, I would've never met Mr. Kensuke, Mr. Toji, Mrs. Hikari. I would've never met Viko, nor you. How about we stop thinking about the what ifs, and focus on these seedlings?"  
"如果我母亲从未将我留在这里呢？" 怜司自言自语道，目光迷失在天空。"如果我父亲没有去世，如果碇源堂从未存在，第三次冲击从未发生呢？" 他轻笑一声，摇了摇头。"那样的话，我就永远不会遇到健介先生、透治先生、光子女士。我也不会遇到维克，更不会遇到你。不如我们停止思考那些假设，专注于这些幼苗吧？"

A needle pressed against his chest, unrelenting. The world outside the barrier was inhospitable, the Wanderers were but scavengers of human life, consuming everything they could in a vain attempt to become whole. Storms, famine, death; all brought about by his hand.  
一根针抵在他的胸口，毫不留情。屏障外的世界充满敌意，流浪者不过是人类生命的拾荒者，他们竭尽所能地吞噬一切，妄图变得完整。风暴、饥荒、死亡；这一切都是他一手造成的。

"I can't," Shinji admitted in defeat. The soil felt like clay in between his fingers as he buried a lime seed. "I'm sorry. This is all my faul-"  
"我做不到，" 真嗣承认失败。土壤在他指间感觉像黏土，他埋下一颗酸橙种子。"对不起。这都是我的错——"

"Shinji, has anybody ever told you to _stop_ apologizing?" Ryoji interrupted. "It's like Viko says. Happiness comes in moments, blink and you'll miss them as they pass you by." The other boy grinned, and Shinji saw Misato's playful smirk yet again. "You like her? The Major? Admitting it might make you happy, you know."  
"真嗣，有没有人告诉过你别再道歉了？" 绫波打断道，"就像维克说的，幸福是转瞬即逝的瞬间，一眨眼就会从你身边溜走。" 另一个男孩咧嘴笑了，真嗣再次看到了美里调皮的微笑。"你喜欢她吗？美里少校？承认这一点可能会让你感到快乐，你知道的。"

"Asuka hat-" Shinji cut himself off, realizing the words did in fact feel empty. "it's not like it matters."  
"明日香，帽——" 真嗣突然打住，意识到这些话确实显得空洞。"这无关紧要。"

"Well, you didn't deny it!" Kaji added. The easy humor of his tone made Shinji's face heat up again.  
"好吧，你没否认！" 加持补充道。他轻松幽默的语气让真嗣的脸再次发烫。

_Happy. Happiness._ A word that had escaped his nightly searches, a meaning that evaded him altogether. Seeing Rei again, being able to fix the damage he had done to the world. Seeing Asuka smile, seeing her healed, and whole, if only for a moment. He pressed both hands on the small mound, almost willing the seedling to grow strong.  
快乐。幸福。这个词曾在他夜间的寻觅中逃逸，其含义对他而言始终难以捉摸。再次见到丽，能够修复他给世界带来的伤害。看到明日香微笑，看到她痊愈，完整，哪怕只是片刻。他用双手紧压着那小土堆，几乎是在催促那幼苗茁壮成长。

They sat together until the sun began to set. Kaji teased him without rest until he excused himself for the evening, and ran back home.  
他们一直坐到太阳开始西沉。加持不停地逗弄他，直到他借口晚上离开，跑回了家。

Aggravated penguins and fish awaited on the coming day. A slight chance of meeting Ms. Lookalike. Perhaps Asuka would appear, and he'd be able to show her the newest additions to his small fireplace. He'd be able to keep true to her instructions and hopefully, get a heated glare for his efforts.  
第二天等待着的是恼人的企鹅和鱼。有轻微的机会遇到那位相貌相似的女士。或许明日香会出现，他就能向她展示壁炉旁新添的小物件。他希望能忠实执行她的指示，并期望因此得到一个热烈的瞪视。

_Happiness,_ Shinji mused. When had he stopped carrying the SDAT everywhere? _Idiot,_ Asuka's voice snapped in his mind. The shadow of a smile, half a chuckle the day she had placed the hat on him_._ The memory relaxed his body, quieted his thoughts. _A place where she can frown at the food every day._  
幸福，真嗣沉思着。他何时不再随身携带 SDAT 了？傻瓜，明日香的声音在他脑海中响起。那一天，她把帽子戴在他头上，留下了一半的微笑，半声轻笑。这段记忆让他的身体放松，思绪平静。一个她每天都能对食物皱眉的地方。

The ocean breeze swayed the flames, mingling the smell of charred wood and cooked vegetable with that of salt water.  
海风轻轻摇曳着火焰，将烧焦木头和熟蔬菜的气味与海水的咸味混合在一起。

She stared at the bowl of soup in amazement, unaware she was the spitting image of Rei Ayanami at that moment. "Delightful," she muttered, taking another sip. "This is your Miso soup, then?"  
她惊讶地盯着那碗汤，没意识到自己此刻与绫波零如出一辙。“美味，”她喃喃道，又喝了一口。“这就是你的味噌汤吗？”

"Well, it's sort of my take on it, considering the ingredients I have nearby." Shinji replied. "I try to use some plants that grow near this area. Viko loaned me a book on which are edible and which are toxic, so I've been trying some different things."  
"嗯，这是我根据手头的材料做的。" 真嗣回答道，"我尽量使用附近生长的植物。维科借给我一本关于哪些可食用哪些有毒的书，所以我一直在尝试不同的东西。"

Another fish began to sizzle under the flames. The birds huddling not too far away were observant, as though expecting their fair share of the feast.  
另一条鱼在火焰下开始滋滋作响。不远处蜷缩的鸟儿们观察着，仿佛期待着它们应得的那份盛宴。

"Before long the rice will be ready for harvest," she conversed. It was pleasant to see Shinji smile, and it brought joy to her heart to see it become more frequent. "I'd like to assist when it is ready."  
"不久之后，稻米就可以收割了，" 她交谈道。看到真嗣微笑是件愉快的事，而看到这种微笑越来越频繁，她的心中也充满了喜悦。"我希望能帮忙收割。"

"Maybe I can help," Shinji offered. It was as the Second had said. Her feelings were clear. "Would you mind?"  
“也许我能帮忙，”真嗣提议道。正如第二使徒所说，她的感情很明确。“你介意吗？”

"I would not," Ms. Lookalike said. "It would be good to spend time together in the fields. Your company is most pleasant."  
“我不介意，”长得像她的女士说，“在田间一起度过时光会很好。你的陪伴非常愉快。”

The sound of something slipping to the floor distracted her from the asymmetric bowl in her grasp. Her comment had caught Shinji off-guard and made him drop one of the raw fish on the ground. He fidgeted, his back to her. _I believe she feels the same way. The one whose company you enjoy._  
某种东西滑落到地面的声音让她从手中的不对称碗上分了心。她的评论让真嗣措手不及，使他掉落了一条生鱼在地上。他局促不安，背对着她。我相信她也有同样的感觉。你喜欢的那个人的陪伴。

"Y-You think so?" he asked.  
“你这么认为吗？”他问道。

_A few weeks before, as I expressed the same sentiment, you rejected it completely. Does one call this maturing, as Mrs. Horaki explained?  
几周前，当我表达同样的观点时，你完全否定了。这难道就是堀木太太所说的成熟吗？_

"Of course," she admitted with ease, looking puzzled. It was, of course, as natural a thing to her as breath. "You are the one I'd wish to spend more ti-"  
“当然，”她轻松地承认，面露困惑。对她来说，这自然得如同呼吸一般。“你是我希望共度更多时光的人——”

"That better not be my dinner on the ground." Asuka's voice rumbled through the broken walls. "What's all this? Cups and pans? Are you two playing house or something?"  
"那最好不是我地上的晚餐。" 明日香的声音在破败的墙壁间回荡。"这都是些什么？杯子和锅？你们俩是在玩过家家吗？"

Shinji's shoulders stiffened, but she noticed how quickly they relaxed. It made her smile. If her favorite person was with his own favorite person, then he'd be at his happiest. This could be yet another precious memory she could take.  
真嗣的肩膀僵硬了一下，但她注意到他们很快又放松了。这让她微笑起来。如果她最喜欢的人和他最喜欢的人在一起，那么他一定会是最快乐的。这可能是她可以带走的又一个珍贵记忆。

"Shinji has been experimenting with the pottery wheel," she explained, fully aware Asuka followed the Third Child on most days. "Results… have been varied."  
"真嗣一直在尝试陶轮，"她解释道，完全知道明日香大多数日子都跟着第三适格者。"结果……参差不齐。"

"From one colossal waste of time to the next, why am I not surprised," Asuka snapped, dragging her preferred box closer to the fire, clad in her usual plug suit and jacket. Her eye glanced over the small containers. "So, you're an artisan now, idiot?"  
“从一个巨大的时间浪费到下一个，我为何不感到惊讶，”明日香厉声说道，将她偏爱的箱子拖近火堆，身着她惯常的插入栓服和夹克。她的目光扫过那些小容器。“所以，你现在成了手工艺人，白痴？”

"Not even close," Shinji responded without much of a stutter. Her crimson eyes fixed on him. "It's really hard, and I'm not very good. But Mr. Koga says even these can be of use."  
“差得远呢，”真嗣回答得毫不犹豫。她的赤红眼眸紧盯着他。“这真的很难，我也不太擅长。但古贺先生说，即便是这些也能派上用场。”

Her fingers traced the irregular edges of her cup. Imperfect copies of something else, rugged around the edges, delicate to the touch and prone to break. _I wonder if he will think of me._  
她的手指沿着杯子的不规则边缘划过。这些不完美的复制品，边缘粗糙，触感细腻却易碎。不知他是否会想起我。

"Whatever," Asuka's voice brought her back to reality. "Something smells different."  
“随便吧，”明日香的声音将她拉回现实。“有股不一样的味道。”

"A-Actually, I'm trying to use some herbs that grow in the area," Shinji replied as he maneuvered the ingredients over the fireplace. "Just hoping I don't mess up the fish."  
“其实，我试着用了些当地生长的香草，”真嗣一边回答，一边在壁炉上处理食材。“只希望别把鱼做砸了。”

"We have caught three," she added, and pointed to the bag next to the fishing rods. "That one is for the village commander."  
“我们抓了三条，”她补充道，指了指鱼竿旁的袋子。“那条是给村长的。”

"Congratulations. So, fish again?" the Major asked with what she perceived to be forced hostility. "Should've brought the damn rations, instead."  
"恭喜啊。所以，又是鱼？" 少校问道，语气中她察觉到一种刻意的敌意。"早知道就该带上那些该死的口粮，而不是这个。"

She caught something, some strange, unspoken message. _Why does it feel like she means the opposite of what she says?_  
她捕捉到了什么，某种奇怪的、未说出口的信息。为什么感觉她话中的意思与表面相反？

"Mr. Koga gave me some sausages, and no rice today. I… made some Miso. Would you like s-"  
"古贺先生给了我一些香肠，今天没有米饭。我……做了一些味噌汤。你愿意尝尝吗……"

"No, I'm perfectly fine sitting here starving while this one here gorges herself on it." _Yes, I would like some, thank you._  
“不，我坐在这里饿着肚子，看着她大快朵颐，感觉好极了。” 是的，我想要一些，谢谢。

Her head tilted to the side. The Second's demeanor had changed in some infinitesimal manner. Her eye was not filled with as much bitterness nor animosity. Instead, the pilot's gaze was slightly troubled, almost forlorn. Once her own portion was served in a less misshapen mug, she glared down at it and ate very slowly.  
她的头微微侧向一边。第二号的态度在某种细微的方式上发生了变化。她的眼中不再充满那么多的苦涩和敌意。相反，驾驶员的目光显得有些忧虑，几乎带着一丝凄凉。当她自己的那份食物被盛在一个不那么歪斜的杯子里时，她低头瞪着它，慢慢地吃着。

"How is it? Does it need any more salt, or spices?" Shinji asked, his back to them. "I tried to balance out the flavors a little."  
“味道如何？需要再加些盐或调料吗？” 真嗣背对着他们问道，“我试着稍微平衡了一下味道。”

"It's not salty," Asuka rasped. She noticed the Second's frown deepen, but in her mind, Ms. Lookalike saw a smile. "Not a bad balance." _It is quite tasty, yes._ "What is this supposed to be, a cup? Tsk. At least it's not leaking." _Good effort at crafting this utensil, Shinji._  
"不咸，" 明日香沙哑地说道。她注意到二号机的眉头皱得更深了，但在她心中，那位长相相似的女士却看到了一丝微笑。"味道还不错。" 确实挺好吃的，是的。"这是什么，一个杯子？啧。至少它不漏水。" 制作这个器具，真是个不错的尝试，真嗣。

She smiled, resisting the urge to giggle. During dinner time or late at night Mrs. Hikari and Mr. Toji would converse. While the tone and way they spoke were completely different, there was an inexplicable resemblance with the way the Second and Third interacted.  
她微笑着，忍住了想笑的冲动。在晚餐时间或深夜，光子女士和渡治先生会交谈。尽管他们的语气和说话方式完全不同，但与二号机和三号机的互动方式有着一种难以言喻的相似之处。

_It feels like… longing,_ she decided, relating it to her own feelings towards Shinji. _I see. So you too, possess these inefficient emotions, Major. I am glad for them, and you will be, as well._  
这感觉像是……思念，她决定，将这种感觉与自己对真嗣的感情联系起来。我明白了。原来你也有这些低效的情感，少校。我很高兴你有这些情感，你也会为此感到高兴的。

They ate in relative silence. Shinji ventured to speak with her more frequently than he did with the Second. He inquired about her discoveries in the fields, her interactions with Tsubame, and occasionally asked if the vegetables were properly cooked. With no frame of knowing if they were, she simply said the taste was enjoyable.  
他们相对沉默地用餐。真嗣比与二号机驾驶员相处时更频繁地与她交谈。他询问她在田野中的发现，与燕的互动，偶尔还会问蔬菜是否烹饪得当。因为没有判断标准，她只是简单地说味道很享受。

Again and again, she saw Asuka glance at her dish. The girl's hand would trace the cup not unlike her own fingers had done. _Bad things, such as bad memories, are better left out in the open. Exteriorized, spoken of, otherwise they become a burden,_ Hikari said in her mind. _But good things, good memories, should be cherished and guarded. Every time we get back to them, we'll feel that happiness again._  
一次又一次，她看到明日香瞥向她的盘子。女孩的手会沿着杯子边缘游走，就像她自己的手指曾经做过的那样。不好的事情，比如糟糕的记忆，最好公开处理。外在化，说出来，否则它们会成为负担，光在心里说。但美好的事情，美好的记忆，应该珍惜和守护。每次我们回忆起它们，都会再次感受到那份幸福。

"So," Shinji ventured after a few minutes of comfortable silence. "Is the food not okay? Maybe I can d-"  
"那么，"真嗣在几分钟的舒适沉默后试探道。"食物还行吗？也许我可以再...

"It's fine," Asuka interrupted. "I don't need food. Why would I be in a hurry to eat it?" _I want to treasure this moment, this meal. Being with you._  
"没事的，" 明日香打断道。"我不需要食物。我为什么要急着吃呢？" 我想珍惜这一刻，这顿饭。和你在一起。

"Right, sorry." She watched Shinji rise and rummage through the bag he had brought from the forge. "Viko helped me make some pastry today. Since you know… the other day you said the jam was good."  
"对，抱歉。" 她看着真嗣起身，在他从锻造厂带来的包里翻找。"维科今天帮我做了些糕点。因为你知道……前几天你说果酱很好吃。"

A warm, sweet-smelling dessert wrapped in leaves was presented to each of them. Whereas the Second wrinkled her nose at the treat and pocketed it in her jacket without a word, she devoured hers in seconds, shocked to still find it crunchy, and indescribably sweet.  
一份用叶子包裹的温暖香甜甜点呈现在他们面前。第二适格者皱着鼻子，一言不发地将她的那份塞进夹克口袋，而她则几秒钟就狼吞虎咽地吃完了，惊讶地发现它依然酥脆，且甜得不可思议。

The birds behind Shinji set out to hunt, splashing in the water one after the other just as light started to fade from the sky. They spoke so little with each other, yet every word, every movement or expression carried so much meaning. Even the silence felt important between them.  
新治身后的鸟儿们开始捕猎，一只接一只地溅起水花，就在天空中的光线开始消退之时。他们彼此间言语甚少，然而每一句话、每一个动作或表情都蕴含着深意。就连他们之间的沉默也显得格外重要。

_I am… jealous?_ The young clone wondered as Shinji told Asuka of his day at the forge, and of the difficulty of getting clay stains off his clothing. _No. I am relieved._ Her gaze softened as she watched the redhead glare down at Shinji's fireplace. _There is another who holds him just as dearly. He will not be alone._  
我是……嫉妒吗？年轻的克隆体思索着，当新治向明日香讲述他在铁匠铺的一天，以及去除衣物上泥土污渍的困难时。不，我是松了一口气。她看着红发少女对新治的壁炉怒目而视时，目光柔和了下来。还有另一个人同样深爱着他。他不会孤单的。

"You hate it, then, huh. Should've known." Asuka inquired once night had settled in.  
“那你讨厌它，对吧。早该猜到了。”夜幕降临时，明日香问道。

"Hmm? Hate what, Asuka?" "嗯？讨厌什么，明日香？"

"The cap, you idiot. Saw you staring at it from the moment Unit 01 spit you out."  
"那顶帽子，你这个白痴。从零一机把你吐出来那一刻起，你就一直在盯着它看。"

Ms. Lookalike's eyes widened. It had been a while since she had last seen said garment. If memory served, the cap had been comfortably resting on the boy's head the day he had collapsed by the bathhouse.  
那位长相相似的女士眼睛睁大了。她已经很久没有见过那件衣物了。如果记忆没错的话，那顶帽子那天男孩在浴室旁昏倒时还舒适地戴在他头上。

She noticed Shinji's face turn vermillion in the dim light, eliciting a small laugh from her chest.  
她在昏暗的光线中注意到真嗣的脸变得绯红，这让她忍不住轻笑出声。

"Uhm, but it's yours, right?" he asked, voice fading into a whisper.  
“呃，但这是你的，对吧？”他问道，声音渐渐低沉成耳语。

"Not anymore, it isn't." “现在不是了。”

"I don't… what do you mean?"  
"我不……你是什么意思？"

Something clicked in her head. June the 6th had always been important to her, regardless of how foolish it was to follow a calendar. The knowledge had been imprinted at the moment of her creation, yet only now did she realize its significance.  
她脑海中突然灵光一闪。6 月 6 日对她来说一直都很重要，不管追随一个日期有多么愚蠢。这个日期在她被创造的那一刻就被深深印刻，然而直到现在她才意识到它的重要性。

"Your birthday was a few days ago. The day you went out with Kenken to get that stupid wheel."  
"你的生日是几天前。你和 Kenken 出去买那个愚蠢的轮子的那天。"

A brighter smile blossomed on her lips. _Ah. So that is why._ Observing Shinji struggle for words was as delightful as the soup. She suddenly wished to have something to offer as a gift, as well.  
她的唇边绽放出更加灿烂的笑容。啊，原来如此。看着真嗣结结巴巴的样子，就像那碗汤一样令人愉悦。她突然希望自己能送出些什么作为礼物，也是一样。

"I… I don't know what to say," Shinji stuttered once the sound of the waves became uncomfortable even to her. "Asuka, how can I r-"  
"我……我不知道该说什么，"真嗣在海浪声变得连她都觉得不适时结巴起来。"明日香，我该怎么……"

"Don't say anything," Asuka cut in. "Just go tend to your stupid tree or something. Make use of whatever light's left, I'll put out the fire or whatever."  
"别说了，"明日香打断道。"去照顾你那棵蠢树什么的吧。趁着还有光，我会把火灭掉什么的。"

Shinji looked ready to say something else. His happy expression became confused, conflicted, and it amazed her how she was able to recognize each emotion as it washed through his features.  
真嗣看起来还想说些什么。他那愉快的表情变得困惑、矛盾，她惊讶于自己能识别出他脸上每一种情绪的流露。

"I will assist here, if allowed," she added. "The saplings have been getting ravaged by ants."  
“如果允许的话，我会在这里帮忙，”她补充道，“树苗一直被蚂蚁破坏。”

"What! Ants?" Shinji exclaimed, bolting to his feet. "That can't be right! We sprayed them yesterday! Damn it! Ah… I'll see you in the house, Asuka! Thank you both for coming!"  
“什么！蚂蚁？”真嗣惊呼，猛地站起身来，“这不可能！我们昨天才喷过药！该死！啊……我会在屋里见你，明日香！谢谢你们过来！”

His footsteps quickly disappeared under the crashing of the waves and the ocean breeze. They both stood near the rudimentary kitchen, staring as the cinders as they faded. The sensation came over her once more. Eyes like her own, gigantic, bleeding. Her body threatened to shut down, and in that instant a needle was pressed against her thigh. LCL was pumped into her veins.  
他的脚步声很快就被海浪的轰鸣和海风所掩盖。两人站在简陋的厨房旁，凝视着渐渐熄灭的余烬。那种感觉再次袭来。巨大的、流血的眼睛，与她如出一辙。她的身体几近崩溃，就在那一刻，一根针扎进了她的大腿。LCL 被注入她的血管。

"Good timing there with that lie about the ants. It's not much, but this should see you through until the WUNDER lands," Asuka rasped, then pushed a handful of syringes full with the yellow liquid into her hands. "You know, Ayanami. Once, long ago, one of your predecessors and I tried to cook something for that idiot. We were supposed to have a dinner. First her with your creator and Shinji, and then the three of us."  
“你撒谎说蚂蚁的事，时机把握得不错。虽然不多，但这应该能让你撑到 WUNDER 降落。”明日香嘶哑地说道，然后将一把装满黄色液体的注射器塞到她手里。“你知道吗，绫波。很久以前，你的一个前辈和我曾尝试为那个笨蛋做点什么。我们本该共进晚餐的。先是她和你的创造者以及真嗣，然后是我们三个。”

"Oh," she stared at the syringes. "Did something happen?"  
“哦，”她盯着那些注射器。“发生了什么事吗？”

"The world ended, I was turned into a weaponized half-breed monster, you lot came into the picture," the Second elaborated. Rei was surprised to see her crouch and grab her designated clay piece to examine it. "I suppose this is as good as the idiot's gonna get."  
“世界终结了，我变成了武器化的半人半怪物，你们这群人就出现了，”第二适格者详细解释道。丽惊讶地看到她蹲下并拿起她指定的泥塑棋子仔细端详。“我想这已经是那白痴能达到的最好水平了。”

"Did you prepare a meal for him?" she asked with honest curiosity. "If I knew how to cook, I would like to try. Ikari-kun seems so content when cooking for others."  
“你给他准备饭了吗？”她带着真诚的好奇问道。“如果我会做饭，我倒是很想试试。碇君在为别人做饭时看起来那么满足。”

Strange. Shikinami smiled, but there was no joy in her eye, not like when Hikari or Shinji smiled. All she could see was sadness, loneliness, and defeat.  
奇怪。式波笑了，但她的眼中没有喜悦，不像光或真嗣笑时那样。她只能看到悲伤、孤独和挫败。

"I tried," Asuka revealed, and placed the makeshift cup back down with the utmost care. "Didn't really matter in the end. Everything went ass backwards before your predecessor or I could have our little contest."  
"我试过了，" 明日香透露道，小心翼翼地将临时杯子放回原处。"最终也没什么意义。在你前任或我有机会进行那场小比赛之前，一切就已经乱套了。"

"Contest?" "比赛？"

Asuka shook her head, making the jacket's hood fall off. "Nothing. Forget about it."  
明日香摇摇头，外套的帽子随之滑落。"没什么，忘了它吧。"

_But there is none,_ Ms. Lookalike realized. _What Shinji Ikari feels for Rei Ayanami is not the same as what he feels for Asuka Shikinami._  
但事实并非如此，这位酷似某人的女士意识到。碇真嗣对绫波零的感情，与他对式波·明日香·兰格雷的感情截然不同。

"Understood," she said, pocketing the syringes in the jacket. Asuka began to walk into the trail that led to the saplings. "These… inefficient emotions,"she said, loud enough to make the Second halt in her tracks. "Do they bother you?"  
“明白了，”她边说边将注射器揣进夹克口袋。明日香开始沿着通往幼苗的小径走去。“这些……低效的情感，”她大声说道，足以让第二适格者停下脚步。“它们困扰你吗？”

The fading daylight allowed her to glimpse at the girl's true face. The mask of anger melted away for a few precious seconds. "At times, it feels like they're the reason I'm still here at all," Asuka revealed. "It's annoying that they don't fade away. Everything else seems to."  
夕阳的余晖让她得以一窥女孩的真实面目。愤怒的面具在珍贵的几秒钟内融化了。“有时候，我感觉正是这些情感让我依然留在这里，”明日香坦言，“它们不消散，真是烦人。其他一切都似乎在消逝。”

The penguins sprang back to the surface, drowning out Asuka's footsteps. _I do not wish for them to fade away, these emotions, these memories. They are so very pleasant._ Her eyes drifted to the moon, where the thousand crosses stained the clear light crimson. Another precious memory resurfaced. Hikari smiled in her mind, and pointed to the word underlined in the book.  
企鹅们纷纷跃回水面，淹没了明日香脚步声。我不希望这些情感、这些记忆消逝。它们如此美好。她的目光飘向月亮，那里千百个十字架染红了清澈的光辉。又一珍贵记忆浮现。光在她的脑海中微笑，指向书中被划线的词。

"Longing," she recited. "A strong craving, a desire for something mostly unattainable."  
“憧憬，”她念道，“强烈的渴望，对大多难以企及之物的向往。”

---

"Paint?" “绘画？”

Koga's massive arms crossed as he stared at the sky in wonder. Behind him, the furnaces burned and the sound of hammers echoed out. After his fourth attempt the gift had taken shape, and with the large man's assistance, it was bound to not break easily.  
Koga 粗壮的双臂交叉着，惊奇地凝视着天空。在他身后，熔炉燃烧着，锤击声回荡开来。经过第四次尝试，礼物终于成型了，有了这位大汉的帮助，它注定不会轻易破碎。

"I guess I can try to use some of the colors of the clay, maybe dilute the coals to get a black taint," Shinji mentioned. "But I don't know if those will simply wash away."  
“我想我可以尝试使用一些黏土的颜色，或许稀释煤灰来获得黑色污渍，”Shinji 说道，“但我不确定这些会不会轻易洗掉。”

"Hmm, yeah. That won't last much. We fired the piece twice with the basis already, stuff like clay or coal won't stick." Koga let out a loud bark of laughter. "There's one person I know, who lives close by and has an array of different natural pigments you can use," the man said, smiling wide. "But you're not gonna like who it is."  
“嗯，是的。那样不会持久。我们已经用基础材料烧制了两次，黏土或煤灰之类的东西不会粘附。”Koga 发出一阵响亮的笑声。“我认识一个人，住在附近，拥有各种天然颜料，”他笑着说，“但你不会喜欢是谁。”

Shinji groaned as quietly as possible, which was still loud enough for Koga to hear. The man burst into a fit of throaty laughter, and slapped him twice on the back. _Of course, it's Viko,_ he thought, shoulders slumping. _Of course it is._  
真嗣尽可能小声地呻吟了一声，但声音还是大到让古贺听见了。那人爆发出一阵沙哑的笑声，还拍了拍他的背。当然，是维科，他想，肩膀耷拉下来。果然是他。

"Guess that means more plant duty," Shinji mumbled, eliciting more mirth from the forge master. "Nothing's really free with Viko except the damn lemonade."  
“猜这意味着又得多照料植物了，”真嗣嘟囔道，引得锻造大师又一阵欢笑。“在维科这儿，除了那该死的柠檬水，没什么是真正免费的。”

"Hey, it's good for you! Ain't that what he always says?" Koga went back into the forge with a wave. "The pieces will be ready tomorrow. Good luck, kid!"  
“嘿，对你有好处！这不是他常说的吗？”古贺挥挥手回到锻造间。“零件明天就准备好。祝你好运，小子！”

Relinquishing his wish to end his afternoon fishing, and hopefully speaking with Asuka, Shinji headed for the strange man's home. The strange family lived a few minutes away from the village center, in a small wooden house surrounded by a lush, meticulously decorated garden. It always smelled of lemon, lavender, and rain. Every few days a new plant would be added to the garden's 'collection'.  
放弃了下午钓鱼并希望与明日香交谈的愿望，真嗣朝着那位陌生男子的家走去。这个奇特的家庭住在离村庄中心几分钟路程的地方，一栋被茂盛且精心装饰的花园环绕的小木屋。那里总是弥漫着柠檬、薰衣草和雨水的香气。每隔几天，花园的“收藏”中就会增添一种新的植物。

The path to the main door was adorned with river rocks, each containing carved letters in a language he did not recognize. Even after living in the village nigh on a month, and speaking regularly with him, the blonde remained a mystery and a stranger, an unimaginably hospitable person in the most unimaginably inhospitable world.  
通往正门的小径上铺满了河石，每块石头上都刻有他不认识的语言的字母。尽管在村子里已经生活了近一个月，并且经常与他交谈，但那位金发男子依然是一个谜，一个在这个最难以想象的恶劣世界中无比热情好客的陌生人。

_No matter who I ask, nobody says a thing,_ Shinji thought. His hand hovered at the door. _I can just try with the clay and charcoal. Somehow, I'll get a good red color. I just need to try, and then I won't have to ask Viko for anyth-_  
无论我问谁，都没有人透露半点信息，真嗣心想。他的手悬在门前。我可以尝试用黏土和木炭。无论如何，我会调出一种好的红色。我只需要尝试，这样就不必向维科索要任何东西了——

A deafening rumble paralyzed his knuckles just as they were about to knock. Harsh words spoken in a foreign language, in a tone so macabre it took Shinji several seconds to realize who was speaking. He followed the voice, tiptoeing behind the house. The man he related with nothing but smiles was snarling down at large pieces of wood. Shirtless, he grabbed onto the logs and placed them on the chopping block, grumbling in the same foreign language with every step. He screamed before, during, and after the large pieces of wood were split in half.  
一阵震耳欲聋的轰鸣声让他的手指在敲门之际僵住了。一句句刺耳的外语，语调阴森得让真嗣花了好几秒才辨认出是谁在说话。他循声而去，蹑手蹑脚地绕到房子后面。那个平日里总是笑脸相迎的男人，此刻正对着一堆木头咆哮。赤裸上身，他抓起木头放在砧板上，每一步都用同样的外语咕哝着。在木头被劈成两半之前、之中和之后，他都尖叫着。

Viko's features were obscured by a scowl that not even Asuka could possibly rival. The very energy around the clearing froze Shinji's body and placed every sense on high alert. He saw something akin to a barcode on the man's nape, slashes on his back that covered most of the exposed skin, and the horror of his gnarled hands.  
维科的表情被一个连明日香都无法匹敌的怒容所掩盖。清场周围的气氛让真嗣的身体冻结，每一个感官都处于高度警戒状态。他看到男人后颈上类似条形码的痕迹，背部覆盖大部分裸露皮肤的划痕，以及他扭曲双手的恐怖。

_No wonder he wears gloves all the time,_ Shinji realized. His thoughts drifted to Asuka's eye-patch. _Heal,_ his mind rumbled as another massive log was sliced in half. _To make free from injury or disease. To make well again._  
难怪他总是戴着手套，真嗣意识到。他的思绪飘向了明日香的眼罩。愈合，他的内心轰鸣着，又一根巨大的木头被劈成两半。摆脱伤害或疾病。再次恢复健康。

"Blyat!" Viko screamed. The man lodged the axe in the chopping block with a brutal slash, then turned, pointing a finger at Shinji. "You!" he bellowed, switching to Japanese. "Get over here! What are you doing, hiding there like a thief?"  
“妈的！”维科尖叫道。那人用猛力将斧头劈入木桩，随即转身，手指着真嗣吼道：“你！”他切换成日语，“过来！你在那儿躲躲藏藏的，像个贼似的，干什么呢？”

Despite his instincts screaming for flight, he forced his limbs forward. _Earn. Earn, Shinji. Getting that paint is more important than your fear._ "H-Hi," he muttered, gaze drifting to the mountain of chopped logs to his left. "I didn't mean to interrupt."  
尽管本能尖叫着要逃跑，他还是强迫自己的四肢向前移动。赚钱，真嗣，赚钱。拿到那桶油漆比你害怕更重要。“嗨——嗨，”他咕哝着，目光飘向左边堆积如山的劈柴。“我不是有意打扰的。”

"Eh?" the man huffed, hair sticking to his face and back. "Interrupt? Nonsense!" The murderous aura surrounding the area receded in a heartbeat. Viko smiled through the sweat dribbling off his face. "It's always a pleasure to see you, Shinji."  
“嗯？”那人喘着气，头发贴在脸上和背上。“打扰？胡说！”周围的杀气瞬间消散。维科汗流浃背，却笑着说：“见到你总是很高兴，真嗣。”

_Why?_ His mind barked, annoyance igniting anew. His brow furrowed. "Thanks," he responded through gritted teeth. "It can wait if you're… busy."  
为什么？他的内心咆哮着，恼怒再次燃起。他的眉头紧锁。“谢谢，”他咬牙切齿地回应，“如果你……忙的话，我可以等。”

"Nah, I needed a little break, anyhow," Viko said. He rummaged through a bag laying close to the chopping block, produced two bottles of lemonade and threw one in Shinji's direction. "Come over here, the view is best at this time."  
“没事，反正我也需要休息一下。”维科说。他在切菜板旁的包里翻找，拿出两瓶柠檬水，扔了一瓶给真嗣。“过来这边，这时候的景色最好。”

Shinji carefully sat next to where the blonde collapsed, taking a hesitant drink of lemonade sweetened with sugar cane and ginger. The swift change in Viko's demeanor arose all sorts of alarms in his head. Who was this person, exactly?  
真嗣小心翼翼地坐在金发少年倒下的地方旁边，犹豫地喝了一口加了甘蔗和姜的柠檬水。维科态度的迅速转变在他心中引发了各种警报。这个人到底是谁？

"I've been trying to do something for Ryoji," Shinji revealed. "I need some paint to finish it."  
"我一直在为莲二做点什么，"真嗣透露道。"我需要一些颜料来完成它。"

"Do you, now?" Viko asked with a chuckle. Bruised fingers pushed the sweated golden locks away. No sign of the wrath he had just witnessed remained in the man's green eyes. "Let me guess. Blue, white, black, _red_ in different tones. Orange. Golden."  
"你现在需要这个吗？"维科笑着问道。他那被擦伤的手指拨开了被汗水浸湿的金色发丝。男人的绿眼睛里已经没有了刚才所见怒气的痕迹。"让我猜猜。蓝色、白色、黑色、红色，各种色调。还有橙色。金色。"

Misato's pet ruffled its feathers and drank from a beer can in his memory, forcing a brief snicker out of Shinji's chest. The leaves and dry branches behind him crunched, announcing Asuka had arrived. His muscles relaxed further.  
美里养的宠物抖了抖羽毛，在他的记忆中从啤酒罐里喝水，这让真嗣忍不住轻笑了一声。他身后的树叶和枯枝嘎吱作响，阿斯娜的到来宣告了这一切。他的肌肉进一步放松了。

"What's the catch?" he demanded, eyes shifting to Viko's scars. On his chest, stomach, forearms, all over his back and hands. _What in the world happened to you?_  
“有什么条件？”他质问道，目光转向 Viko 身上的伤疤。胸前、腹部、前臂，遍布背部和双手。你到底经历了什么？

"There is none," replied Viko, and took a long sip of his drink. The melancholy in his voice weighed down more heavily than the screams, or what he assumed to be foul language. "I won't tell, either, if you're worried about that." As Viko put a finger to his lips, Shinji noticed there was no nail on it. A piece was missing. "Lips are sealed."  
“没有条件，”Viko 回答，然后深深地喝了一口饮料。他声音中的忧郁比尖叫声或他猜测的污言秽语更加沉重。“我也不会说出去，如果你担心这个的话。”Viko 用手指轻触嘴唇时，Shinji 注意到那根手指上没有指甲，缺了一块。“守口如瓶。”

It happened again, just as it had the first time they had met. Whatever walls his subconscious had built over the years crumbled under the strain of the man's sad smile. _Safety,_ his mind offered. _The condition of being protected from or unlikely to cause danger, risk, or injury._  
同样的事情再次发生，就像他们第一次见面时那样。无论他的潜意识在过去几年里筑起了怎样的壁垒，都在这个男人悲伤的微笑下崩塌了。安全，他的脑海中浮现出这个词。指受到保护或不太可能造成危险、风险或伤害的状态。

Shinji's thoughts instantly drew to crimson-golden hair. A frown firmly placed on her features, deepening with every bite of her meal. Soft fabric atop his head, the splendor of the pirate pin, the cold caress from the roundels as his fingers traced them. Warmth unlike anything he had ever felt, ignited by nothing but her jacket and scent.  
真嗣的思绪立刻转向了那抹绯红金色的发丝。她眉头紧锁，每吃一口饭，眉头就加深一分。柔软的织物覆盖在他的头顶，海盗徽章的辉煌，圆盘上的冰冷触感随着他的手指轻抚而过。一种前所未有的温暖，仅由她的夹克和气息点燃。

He never said a word, nor did Viko request a response. The sight was breathtaking; soft traces of pink, red, yellow and purple painted the firmament to his right, while lamps, lights and candles ignited to his left. Selfishly, he wished for the courage to invite Asuka over to where they sat, share his lemonade with her and ask about her life.  
他从未说出一个字，维科也没有要求回应。这景象令人屏息；右边天际被柔和的粉、红、黄、紫色彩绘满，而左边则是灯火、烛光相继点亮。自私地，他希望有勇气邀请明日香过来他们坐的地方，与她分享他的柠檬水，询问她的生活。

After light faded from the sky, Viko stretched and went inside the house. Shinji dared a sidelong glance to where he knew Asuka to be standing, shocked to see her gaze fixed on the village. _This is the place I protect,_ her voice remarked harshly. His hands curled into fists. _I'd like to protect it, as well._  
当天光从天空消逝后，维科伸了个懒腰，走进屋内。真嗣鼓起勇气斜眼望向他所知的明日香站立之处，惊讶地发现她的目光紧锁着村庄。这是我守护的地方，她的声音严厉地说道。他的双手紧握成拳。我也想保护它。

The way Viko approached without making a sound was eerie. Shinji realized why the man's presence unsettled him so; it was impossible to get a clear read from him. Love, kindness and patience reflected permanently in his green eyes, but there was darkness, as well. Pain and suffering incomprehensible, loneliness, wrath, and agony hid behind the smile.  
Viko 悄无声息地靠近，那种方式令人毛骨悚然。真嗣意识到为何此人的存在让他如此不安；根本无法从他身上读出明确的情感。爱、善良与耐心永远映照在他绿色的眼眸中，但同时也有黑暗。痛苦与折磨难以理解，孤独、愤怒和痛苦隐藏在那微笑背后。

"There, got the best ones," Viko whispered. A small package containing several small plastic bottles was gingerly placed next to him. "Best if you do your little side-project away from prying eyes. Feel free to use the house. Hmm, Ryoji's bound to arrive soon. Wanna stay over for dinner?"  
"好了，拿到了最好的。" Viko 低声说道。一个小包裹，里面装着几个小塑料瓶，被小心翼翼地放在他旁边。"最好在你那小项目远离窥探视线的地方进行。随时可以用这房子。嗯，龙二应该很快就会到了。想留下来吃晚饭吗？"

"Thanks, but I have to go," Shinji responded, and pocketed the paint. _Dinner. Maybe she'll like the stew Hikari taught me to make._ "Say hi to him for me. And… can you please not tell him about any of this?"  
"谢谢，但我得走了，" 真嗣回答，并将颜料放入口袋。晚餐。也许她会喜欢光教我做的炖菜。"替我向他问好。还有…请你不要告诉他任何关于这些的事，好吗？"

"Only if you promise to invite your friend over for lemonade and sight-seeing next time," Viko answered with the familiar easy smile. A gloved finger pressed against his lips again. "Not a word."  
"只有在你答应下次邀请你的朋友来喝柠檬水和观光的情况下，" Viko 带着熟悉的轻松微笑回答。一只戴着手套的手指再次按在他的唇上。"不要说出去。"

"Not a word," Shinji agreed just as quietly. "Uhm, what does _blyat_ mean?"  
"不要说出去，" 真嗣同样轻声地同意。"嗯，blyat 是什么意思？"

"I think you know exactly what it means. Just don't tell Ryoji, I don't like it when he uses foul language."  
"我想你很清楚它是什么意思。只是别告诉亮司，我不喜欢他说脏话。"

They shared a laugh that reinvigorated Shinji's senses. He realized how often he had been laughing lately. Asuka's quiet footfalls accompanied him through the walk back to Kensuke's house. At some point he started feeling light-headed, yet it had nothing to do with lack of food or drink. His stomach rumbled regardless, and a protein bar was pushed into his hands without any explanation.  
他们共享了一个笑声，这让真嗣的精神为之一振。他意识到自己最近笑得有多频繁。明日香轻柔的脚步声伴随着他走回健介家的路上。不知何时，他开始感到有些头晕目眩，但这与饥饿或口渴无关。尽管如此，他的肚子还是咕咕叫了起来，一块蛋白棒被塞到了他手里，没有任何解释。

"Thank you," Shinji said, daring a glance and a hesitant smile. "I have a new recipe I want to try."  
“谢谢，”真嗣说道，鼓起勇气瞥了一眼，露出了一个略带犹豫的微笑。“我有一个新食谱想试试。”

"Better not be bland," Asuka demanded. "Not like it matters, anyway."  
“最好别太淡，”明日香要求道。“反正也不重要。”

He recalled the very few times they walked back from school or NERV. Feet moving slower still, Shinji relished in having Asuka glare at him to ensure the food had been consumed. _Somehow, it doesn't feel like she's just watching a prisoner. The batteries, the jacket, the cap. The dictionary. I have to earn them. Earn, Shinji._  
他回想起他们从学校或 NERV 走回家的那几次寥寥无几的时光。脚步愈发缓慢，真嗣享受着被明日香瞪着确保食物被吃掉的时刻。不知怎的，她看起来并不只是在监视一个囚犯。电池，夹克，帽子。字典。我必须赢得它们。赢得，真嗣。

"To make worthy of, or obtain for." Shinji muttered.  
“为了配得上，或是为了获得。”真嗣喃喃自语。

"What?" “什么？”

"N-Nothing!" "没-没事！"

Asuka shrugged and pointed towards the forest. "Whatever. How's the idiot tree doing?"  
明日香耸了耸肩，指向森林。"管他呢。那棵笨树怎么样了？"

Warmth. It sizzled inside his chest and spread all over his body, akin to the comfort of the jacket. It was the first time she asked about the sapling.  
温暖。它在他的胸腔内滋滋作响，蔓延至全身，就像那件夹克带来的舒适感。这是她第一次问起那棵小树苗。

"It has twenty-eight leaves, now." He tried in vain to hide the excitement in his voice. "The ants took two the other day, but Viko said they have to eat, as well."  
"现在有二十八片叶子了。" 他试图掩饰声音中的兴奋，但徒劳无功。"前几天蚂蚁吃掉了两片，但维科说它们也得吃东西。"

"Like the dumb blonde knows anything about anything," she countered. "You plan on counting the stupid leaves for the next four years?"  
"那个金发傻妞懂什么呀，" 她反驳道。"你打算接下来四年都数这些愚蠢的叶子吗？"

_I'd like to._ The realization slammed against him like Asuka's fist had on the glass. _I'd like to stay here. Help. Build. Earn. I'd like to see you smile, if only just once._  
我愿意。这个念头如明日香一拳击在玻璃上般猛烈地冲击着他。我愿意留在这里。帮忙。建设。赚取。我愿意看到你微笑，哪怕只有一次。

"Would that be a severe enough punishment?" he asked instead. Humor danced in his tone as they reached the house.  
“那会是一个足够严厉的惩罚吗？”他反问道。当他们走到房子前时，他的语气中跳跃着幽默。

"Heh." The corners of Asuka's mouth quirked upward a tiny fraction. "Maybe."  
“呵呵。”明日香嘴角微微上扬了一点点。“也许吧。”

---

"Maybe." “也许吧。”

Ryoji groaned into the bowl and rolled his eyes. "Come on!" he rebuked in vain, pretending to frown at his dinner. "You promised! And what's that thing you say all the time?"  
莲二叹了口气，把头埋进碗里，翻了个白眼。“拜托！”他徒劳地责备道，假装对晚餐皱眉。“你答应过的！还有你那句常说的话是什么来着？”

"Man of my word," Viko replied with a grin. "But I never promised to let you have the guitar."  
“言出必行的人，”维科笑着回答。“但我从没答应过让你拿吉他。”

"It's not like I want to play it," he grumbled. The stew was more delicious than expected, meaning Shinji had come at some point in the night. "I just want to know how it works and stuff."  
“又不是我想弹它，”他咕哝着。炖菜比预想的还要美味，这意味着真嗣在夜里某个时候来过。“我只是想知道它是怎么工作的，诸如此类的。”

"And that is precisely why you're not getting it. It's not a toy you can pick apart and put back together."  
"而这就是你得不到它的原因。它不是你可以拆开再组装起来的玩具。"

"I bet it is, and I bet I can. Come on! I just wanna see how the transistors work! It's important to me!"  
"我打赌它是，而且我打赌我能做到。来吧！我只是想看看晶体管是怎么工作的！这对我很重要！"

"Uh huh," Viko spooned the last remnants of his dinner, chucking. "That's why I said maybe. Now, finish your dinner and drink your lemonade. It's good for you."  
"嗯哼，" Viko 把晚餐的最后一点残渣舀起来，轻笑道。"所以我才说也许。现在，吃完你的晚餐，喝你的柠檬水。这对你有好处。"

"Yeah, yeah. It's good for me," Ryoji downed the glass in a few gulps. "You put a little elbow grease into the stew tonight, didn't you?"  
"是啊，是啊。对我有好处，" 莲二一口喝干了杯子里的酒。"今晚你炖菜时可没少下功夫，对吧？"

"First of all, yuck," Viko replied, laughing. "And second; can't I try to make some good grub for my _Brat_?"  
"首先，真恶心，" 维科笑着回答。"其次；我就不能为我家小鬼做点好吃的吗？"

He picked up one of the limes resting on the table and threw it at the blonde. As always, the projectile was caught in mid-air. "You're so full of it today! You were hoping to have Shinji stay over for dinner again, weren't you?"  
他拿起桌上的一颗青柠朝金发男子扔去。一如既往，那颗青柠在半空中被接住了。"你今天真是满嘴跑火车！你是不是又希望真嗣留下来吃晚饭了？"

Placing a hand against his chest, Viko pretended to be in deep pain. "My own offspring, so distrusting! What did I ever do to deserve this horrible fate?"  
Viko 将手放在胸前，假装深受痛苦。“我自己的后代，如此不信任我！我究竟做了什么，要遭受这样的可怕命运？”

"You raised me, so I know you pretty damn well," Ryoji smiled and threw another lime, with no satisfying result. How were the man's reflexes so well honed? "You're trying to sit them together at the table and tease them. I see you, Mr. Cupid. You really shouldn't push it, you know."  
“你养大了我，所以我对你了解得相当透彻，”Ryoji 微笑着又扔了一颗青柠，结果依旧不尽人意。那人的反应怎么如此敏锐？“你想让他们坐在同一张桌子上，然后戏弄他们。我看得出来，丘比特先生。你真的不该再推波助澜了，知道吗？”

"It's not pushing, per se. Just a little nudge in the right direction." Viko cut the most recent lime in half and threw a piece in Ryoji's direction. The lime landed perfectly in the middle of his bowl. "But you may have a point. Can't help myself, though! I mean, don't you want to sort of smack them together at times, as well?"  
“这不算推波助澜，顶多是个小小的推动。”Viko 将最近的青柠切成两半，朝 Ryoji 的方向扔了一块。青柠完美地落在了他的碗中央。“不过你说的也有道理。但我就是忍不住！我是说，你难道不想偶尔也把他们凑在一起吗？”

"Are you kidding? Every freaking day." Ryoji pointed at the window, in the direction of the fields. "She follows him everywhere, _everywhere_! And she's been having those weird 'dinner parties' with him and Ms. Lookalike, too. It's like they're joined at the hip, I swear."  
"你在开玩笑吧？每天都是这样。" 莲司指着窗外，朝着田野的方向。"她走到哪儿都跟着他，哪儿都跟！而且她还和那个长得像的女士一起搞那些奇怪的'晚餐派对'。简直就像他们连体婴一样，我发誓。"

Amusement reverberated through the room. Life was good, always had been for him, regardless of how terrible of a world he had to live in.  
房间里回荡着愉悦的气氛。生活对他来说一直很好，无论他必须生活在一个多么糟糕的世界里。

"So you agree that some proper… nudging… would be good for the situation, yes?"  
"所以你同意，给这种情况来点适当的……推动……会是个好主意，对吧？"

"Nope. I think they're doing just fine on their own." Another fit of cackles exploded from the boy's mouth when Viko pretended to be stabbed yet again. "Shinji told me she gave him her hat or something? When have you ever seen the great Major give anything to… well, anybody?"  
"不，我觉得他们自己过得挺好的。" 当 Viko 再次假装被刺时，男孩爆发出一阵咯咯的笑声。"真司告诉我她把她的帽子给了他还是怎么的？你什么时候见过伟大的少校给过……嗯，任何人东西？"

"A fair point, but hey, can't blame a man for trying!" Viko rose from the table, refilled both their bowls as he nibbled on the diced limes, and sat back down with an exaggerated groan. "Have you told him that you don't actually want the cake he's bending over backwards to bake for you yet?"  
"说得有理，但嘿，尝试一下总没错吧！" Viko 从桌边站起，一边嚼着切丁的酸橙一边重新填满两人的碗，然后夸张地呻吟一声坐了回来。"你告诉他你其实不想要他费尽心思为你烤的蛋糕了吗？"

"Nah, I'll let it be. Suppose you're bound to be right at something," Ryoji said in between bites. The stew was delicious. "It's nice to have him around, isn't it?"  
"没呢，我就随它去吧。想来你总会在某些事情上说对的，" 凌司边吃边说。这炖菜真是美味。"有他在身边挺好的，不是吗？"

"It's nice to have _them_ around," Viko corrected, pointing at him with his spoon. "Wouldn't be half as fun if you didn't catch her ducking out of sight."  
"有他们在身边真好，" Viko 纠正道，用勺子指着他。"如果你没发现她躲起来，乐趣可就少了一半。"

The comment was disregarded with a shrug. Ryoji frowned at his stew. "I just wish she was more honest. With herself, with him, with us. You know? How dumb is it to pretend to hate a person you're constantly looking after?"  
这个评论被一个耸肩忽略了。Ryoji 皱着眉头看着他的炖菜。"我只是希望她能更诚实。对自己，对他，对我们。你知道吗？假装讨厌一个你一直在照顾的人，这有多傻？"

"Well, she's had a very complicated life, from what I understand," his father, sibling and friend responded. "Reminds me a bit of my brother. Only he was _extremely_ honest and upfront about everything."  
"嗯，据我所知，她的生活非常复杂，"他的父亲、兄弟和朋友回应道。"让我想起了我的弟弟。只是他非常诚实，对一切都直言不讳。"

His head perked up at the last remark, having considered something similar days before. "She does? In what way?"  
听到最后那句话，他的头猛地抬了起来，几天前他也曾有过类似的念头。“她真的这样吗？具体是什么样的？”

"You know, angry all the time, sometimes even viciously so," Viko explained further. "Not really living, just expecting the next fight. Awaiting death as some sort of solace or freedom. Dreaming of a simple life as the greatest Nirvana. Makes me want to help."  
“你知道的，总是生气，有时甚至到了恶毒的地步，”维科进一步解释道，“不是真正地活着，只是期待着下一场战斗。把死亡当作某种慰藉或自由。梦想着简单的生活，认为那是最大的涅槃。这让我很想帮助她。”

"That's something you share with Shinji, then," he reasoned. "Most of us just follow the big fu-"  
"“这么说，你和真嗣有共同点了，”他推理道，“我们大多数人只是跟着大……”

"Language, child." "语言，孩子。"

"-screw off sign on her forehead." The pair shared yet another laugh. "Anyway. I guess you're doing what you can. Helping her by helping him, I mean."  
"-额头上写着‘滚开’。" 两人又是一阵大笑。"总之。我想你是在尽力而为。我的意思是，通过帮助他来帮助她。"

"Step by step, little by little," Viko repeated. Even if he was like a broken record most times, Ryoji found his sayings endearing. "Can't start with the whole forest at once."  
"一步一步，一点一点，" Viko 重复道。尽管他很多时候像个破唱片，但龙二觉得他的话很可爱。"不能一开始就面对整个森林。"

The remnants of paint lingered on parts of Viko's pants and apron. His eyes narrowed at the white, red and black stains. "How come you scheduled me and him for different tasks this entire week? You know I don't want a big party, or any dumb gift."  
油漆的残迹还留在维科的裤子和围裙上。他眯起眼睛盯着那些白色、红色和黑色的污渍。“为什么整个星期你都安排我和他做不同的任务？你知道我不想要盛大的派对，也不想要任何愚蠢的礼物。”

"And yet you'll be getting both." Viko gave him a wolfish grin. "It's fun to shake things up from time to time. Keeps life interesting."  
“然而你两者都会得到。”维科露出了狡黠的笑容。“偶尔改变一下挺有趣的。让生活保持趣味。”

"I just want my application approved," he complained yet again. "That'd be the best present ever."  
“我只想我的申请被批准，”他再次抱怨道。“那将是我收到过的最好的礼物。”

"Yeah, over my dead body. You're getting a party and you're gonna love it. Who knows, maybe even the Major will show up!"  
"是啊，除非我死了。你得办个派对，而且你会喜欢的。谁知道呢，也许连少校都会露面！"

"Oh, joy, can't wait for that." This time, the frown was sincere. "You're being lame, you know."  
"哦，真高兴，迫不及待了。" 这次，皱眉是真心的。"你真是逊毙了，知道吗？"

Viko laughed heartily, slapped the table twice and set off to wash the dishes. "I used to say that to my brother all the time. Now, tell me more about this hat."  
维科大笑起来，拍了两下桌子，起身去洗碗。"我以前经常这么跟我哥说。现在，再跟我多讲讲这顶帽子的事。"

Despite his request being ignored for the umpteenth time, Ryoji's mood brightened at the memory of how much Shinji had blushed the day before.  
尽管他的请求再次被忽视，但想起前一天真嗣脸红的样子，亮司的心情还是明朗了起来。

"Well, you remember those roundels?"  
“嗯，你还记得那些圆徽吗？”

---

The leader narrowed its eyes at her again.  
领头的再次眯起眼睛盯着她。

_What? Do you have a problem, you stupid bird?_ She felt like throwing a fish bone at it, if only to incense the penguin. _I know the idiot's fond of you lot, but I'll cook you up right here if you keep staring at me._  
什么？你有意见吗，蠢鸟？她真想扔根鱼骨头过去，哪怕只是为了激怒那只企鹅。我知道那傻瓜喜欢你们这些家伙，但你要是再盯着我看，我就在这儿把你给炖了。

"I think it likes you," Shinji's voice made her eyebrow twitch in annoyance. "Keeps staring at you all the time."  
“我觉得它喜欢你，”真嗣的声音让她眉头一跳，感到不悦。“一直盯着你看呢。”

"There's a difference between staring and glaring, you of all people know that," Asuka replied, and glared at her 'prisoner' for emphasis. "Not half bad, this fish. Those herbs you're using and the lemon don't make for a poor taste."  
“盯着看和瞪眼是有区别的，你最清楚不过了，”明日香回答道，并为了强调而瞪了她的‘俘虏’一眼。“这鱼不错，你用的那些香草和柠檬味道也不赖。”

"Thank you!" Shinji beamed at her, which ruffled the unsettling emotions in her belly and chest.  
"谢谢你！" 真嗣对她露出了灿烂的笑容，这让她的腹部和胸口那些不安的情绪更加纷乱。

"Could use a little more salt, though," she added. A small bag containing the spice was quickly presented to her. "Hmm, artisan, fisherman, cook, and now waiter as well," she sprinkled a bit on her fish, suppressing the urge to smirk in brutal fashion. "You've been a busy idiot lately."  
"不过可以再加点盐，" 她补充道。一个小袋子迅速递到她面前，里面装着调料。"嗯，工匠、渔夫、厨师，现在还兼任服务员，" 她往鱼上撒了点盐，强忍住以残酷方式嘲笑的冲动。"你最近真是忙得像个傻瓜。"

"We're baking a big cake for Ryoji's birthday in the ration center," Shinji said. "I've had to hide my gift from him in three different spots, already."  
"我们在配给中心为凌司的生日烤一个大蛋糕，" 真嗣说。"我已经不得不把我的礼物藏在了三个不同的地方。"

Grumbling half a chuckle, Asuka picked at her plate and never realized her eye had lost its dangerous edge altogether. "You're actually going through with it? That dumb cake and the clay figure?"  
阿斯兰半带笑意地咕哝着，拨弄着盘子里的食物，完全没有意识到她的眼神已经失去了往日的锐利。“你真的要这么做？那个傻乎乎的蛋糕和泥塑小人？”

"Yeah." Shinji looker over his shoulder, to his left, his right, and gingerly stood from his box. "D-Do you wanna see how it's coming along?"  
“嗯。”真嗣回头看了看，左顾右盼，小心翼翼地从箱子上站了起来。“你……你想看看进展如何吗？”

The Third apparently took her nonchalant shrug as a 'yes'. He hurried to one of the smaller rooms of the old building, rummaging through firewood, rocks, and discarded pieces. His absence gave her a chance to see how he had basically built a small oven, and a top surface that worked as a skillet with naught but clay, pieces of metal and rocks.  
第三适格者显然把她的无所谓耸肩当成了“愿意”。他急忙跑到旧建筑的一个小房间里，翻找着柴火、石头和废弃的碎片。他的离开让她有机会看到他如何用泥土、金属片和石头搭建了一个小烤炉和一个充当煎锅的顶部表面。

_What a freaking idiot_. Asuka's gaze caressed the cup he had made for her. _I was joking about the whole fresh catch thing. And yet every other day now, we sit here like a pair of god damn children, wasting time. Here I am, pretending to be fourteen. Playing house with this idiot and the clone. Pathetic._  
真是个大傻瓜。明日香的目光轻轻拂过他为她做的那杯饮料。我不过是开个关于新鲜捕获的玩笑。然而现在，每隔一天，我们就坐在这里，像一对该死的小孩，浪费时间。我在这里，假装自己十四岁。和这个傻瓜还有那个克隆人玩过家家。可悲。

Shinji approached, still looking, craning his head in all directions to ensure Ryoji was nowhere in sight. _Why do I not want this to end, if it's so pathetic? I thought I had laid all those thoughts aside long ago._  
真嗣走近了，依旧四处张望，伸长脖子确保看不到良治的身影。既然这么可悲，为什么我不想这一切结束呢？我以为我早就抛开了所有这些念头。

"So, remember when we were in Misato's apartment?" Shinji inquired, voice barely above a whisper.  
“那么，记得我们在美里小姐的公寓里的时候吗？”真嗣轻声问道。

"I do." Asuka's shoulders, stiff for about fourteen years, uncoiled a tiny fraction. "What about it?"  
"我愿意。" 绫波的肩膀，僵硬了大约十四年，微微松动了一点点。"那又怎样？"

Both their expression darkened with sadness once he next spoke. "Remember Pen-Pen, and Misato drinking beer at the table?"  
当他再次开口时，两人的表情都因悲伤而阴沉下来。"记得 Pen-Pen，还有美里在桌边喝啤酒吗？"

"Yeah. Annoying bird, not unlike your friends over there," she pointed at the leader, who had opted to stand a few feet away from Shinji in the afternoons. "Bathing in the tub like he owned it when I was trying to take a shower."  
"是啊。那只讨厌的鸟，跟你那边的朋友差不多，" 她指着那位领袖，他选择在下午时分站在离真嗣几英尺远的地方。"在我洗澡的时候，它就像主人一样泡在浴缸里。"

"Oh, yeah," he muttered. She peeked through the curtain of overgrown hair, satisfied to see his face turn scarlet. "He gave me a scare in the shower, too. But… you gave me a good idea that day. Ryoji really doesn't know his mom at all, and it's painful for him. So…"  
"哦，是啊，"他喃喃道。她透过蓬乱的头发缝隙窥视，满意地看到他的脸变得通红。"他在浴室里也吓了我一跳。不过……那天你给了我一个好主意。亮司真的完全不了解他的妈妈，这让他很痛苦。所以……"

He removed the stained rag concealing a ceramic figure that resembled a penguin. The flippers were mismatched, one of the legs was a bit smaller, the beak was slightly crooked. And yet, Asuka saw the foolish backpack, the name engraved at its chest, the feathers around the beak and head.  
他移开了那块沾满污渍的破布，露出一个类似企鹅的陶瓷雕像。鳍状肢不匹配，一条腿稍小，喙部略微歪斜。然而，明日香看到了那个傻乎乎的书包，胸前刻着的名字，喙部和头部的羽毛。

Pen-Pen squawked happily at her, as though being held on Shinji's hands and wiggling with a beer in between its claws. "Pfft." She chortled, shaking her head, and smiled. "Yeah, I can see the resemblance."  
Pen-Pen 在她面前欢快地叫着，仿佛被真嗣捧在手里，爪子间还夹着一瓶啤酒，扭动着身体。"噗。"她轻笑出声，摇了摇头，微笑道："是啊，我看得出这相似之处。"

Nearing the figurine brought more minute details such as the attention to the surface to imitate feathers, the careful strokes of paint, and the almost lively expression on its features. She took it from his shaking hands, and inspected the beer can held in the left flipper. The piece glistened to a degree, it felt sturdy enough to not crack under her hold.  
靠近雕像，更多细微之处显现出来，比如模仿羽毛的表面处理，精心的彩绘笔触，以及那几乎栩栩如生的表情。她从他颤抖的手中接过，仔细检查着左鳍中握着的啤酒罐。这件作品闪闪发光，感觉坚固到足以在她手中不致破裂。

"Not bad, Third," Asuka said, pushing the figurine in his direction. "What?" She raised her one visible eyebrow when Shinji made no move to retrieve it. "Penguin got your tongue?"  
“还不错，三号，”明日香说着，将雕像推向他那边。“什么？”当真嗣没有伸手去拿时，她扬起唯一可见的眉毛。“企鹅堵住你的舌头了？”

The expression on him was strange, nothing she had ever seen before. His face was flushed, mouth somewhat agape. Shock? No, the way his eyes almost shone was intense enough to make her uncomfortable. The flames of her hatred and rage smoldered and self-consciousness arose in her being for once in fourteen years.  
他的表情很奇怪，是她从未见过的。他的脸颊泛红，嘴巴微张。是震惊吗？不，他的眼神几乎闪耀着光芒，强烈到让她感到不安。她心中的仇恨与愤怒之火渐渐熄灭，十四年来第一次感到自我意识的觉醒。

"What?" Asuka repeated. "什么？" 明日香重复道。

"You're… smiling," Shinji said, almost in a trance. He looked just about ready to burst into tears. "You're smiling."  
"你在……微笑，" 真嗣说道，几乎像是在恍惚中。他看起来几乎要哭出来了。"你在微笑。"

She smirked wider and got to her feet, pushing the figurine into his arms just as she pushed the misery and anger down. _I'll give myself this moment, because it's all I'll ever have_. "So? Have you never seen me smile before?"  
她咧嘴笑得更开了，站起身来，将那个小雕像塞进他的怀里，就像她将痛苦和愤怒压下去一样。我会给自己这一刻，因为这是我唯一拥有的。"那又怎样？你以前没见过我笑吗？"

"No, I don't think so." His voice shook, uneven. "Not until today."  
"不，我不这么认为。" 他的声音颤抖，不平稳。"直到今天。"

"Heh, you say the dumbest things." Asuka shook her head and turned to him, arms crossed. "You keep whispering all those definitions like a broken record. Give me a good word, then. What's so damn important about me smiling? What's it to you?"  
"哼，你总是说些最傻的话。" 明日香摇摇头，转向他，双臂交叉。"你不停地低声重复那些定义，像个坏掉的唱片。给我一个好词，然后呢。我笑对你来说有什么该死的重要的？这对你意味着什么？"

"Treasure," Shinji said without missing a beat.  
"珍宝，" 真嗣毫不犹豫地说道。

The smile faded from her lips and blood rushed to her face. Asuka's eye widened. She turned away just as Shinji came to and slapped a hand on his mouth. Only then did she realize why he took such care of the cap, never wore it and gazed at the roundels at dinner. Why the jacket was cared for and worn only on very cold nights. Why certain words were marked in red.  
她的笑容从唇边消失，血液涌上面颊。明日香瞪大了眼睛。她转过身去，就在这时真嗣醒了过来，用手捂住了嘴巴。直到这时，她才明白为什么他如此珍视那顶帽子，从不佩戴，只在晚餐时凝视那些圆徽。为什么那件夹克被精心照料，只在非常寒冷的夜晚才穿上。为什么某些词被用红色标记。

_Stupid. Stupid brat. You're too god damn late for this. It's too late. It's… god damn it, Shinji. Why did you have to pick_ _**that**_ _word?_  
愚蠢。愚蠢的小子。你来得太晚了。已经太晚了。真是……该死，真嗣。你为什么要选那个词？

"What are you, stupid?" she all but whispered. Her face was burning. "Let's go. It's late, and I'm done staring at those birds. Go hide your dumb present and move it."  
“你是不是傻？”她几乎是在耳语。她的脸颊发烫。“走吧。已经很晚了，我不想再盯着那些鸟看了。去把你的蠢礼物藏好，然后动起来。”

Shinji did as instructed. In moments they were walking back to the station in a weirdly comfortable silence. At some point in the last five days, she had stopped bothering to walk behind him or conceal her presence. Asuka's heart thundered in her ears and chest, body alive with adrenaline. Her mind was hazy. She was standing to his left, instead of the right like normal.  
真嗣照做了。片刻间，他们便在一种怪异的舒适沉默中走回车站。在过去五天中的某个时刻，她已不再费心跟在他身后或隐藏自己的存在。明日香的心跳在耳边和胸腔中剧烈跳动，身体因肾上腺素而充满活力。她的思绪模糊。她站在他的左边，而不是像平常那样站在右边。

"Sorry." Shinji muttered once they reached the house.  
“对不起。”他们到达房子时，真嗣低声说道。

The apology felt sincere, as though he was truly afraid to have offended her. Another grumble resembling a chuckle blossomed from her chest. _Leave it to the Third to apologize for giving a compliment to someone._  
这道歉听起来很真诚，仿佛他真的害怕冒犯到她。她的胸腔里又发出了一声类似轻笑的咕哝。让第三适格者为向某人表达赞美而道歉，真是再正常不过了。

"Idiot." Asuka shook her head and pointed to the door. "Get some sleep, tomorrow's the brat's birthday party, after all. And no, no way in hell am I going to that mess."  
“白痴。”明日香摇了摇头，指着门说，“去睡吧，明天毕竟是那小鬼的生日派对。不过，我可绝对不会去那种乱糟糟的地方。”

_Could see that question coming from a mile away. I'm not your clone friend, Shinji. I don't do parties. If you want to see me, you can just come here.  
早就料到你会问这种问题。我不是你的复制品，真嗣。我不参加派对。如果你想见我，直接来这里就行。_

She stood outside, watching the sky long after Shinji settled into his blankets and continued with the song's translation. Only the final verses remained.  
她站在外面，望着天空，直到真嗣钻进被窝，继续翻译那首歌的歌词。只剩下最后几句了。

"Inefficient emotions," Asuka mused. How many times had she gazed at the stars and wondered if he was still out there, trapped in that coffin with Unit 01? "Guess you're not the only one glad for them, Ayanami."  
"无用的情感，" 明日香沉思着。她有多少次凝望星空，想知道他是否还在那里，与初号机一起困在那棺材中？"看来你不是唯一为此感到高兴的人，绫波。"

---

_I can't believe it.  我简直不敢相信。_

His hands stilled despite the nervous energy coursing through every fiber of his being. Carefully cutting the sushi rolls and placing them next to the sausages and sauce, Shinji closed the bento with minute care. It felt imperative to make every meal singular and better than the last.  
尽管紧张的能量贯穿他的每一根神经，他的手却停了下来。小心翼翼地切着寿司卷，将它们放在香肠和酱汁旁边，真嗣细致地合上了便当盒。他觉得有必要让每一顿饭都独一无二，比上一顿更好。

_Can I be selfish? I said only once, but could I see it again, please?  
我可以自私一次吗？我只说过一次，但请让我再看一次，好吗？_

Asuka lay on her bed as Shinji finished the commander's meal and placed hers on the table. He wanted to see her, and was terrified of it all at once. Reality felt intangible for reasons alien to his broken mind. Desperate for any type of solace from the growing uncertainty, Shinji focused on every detail for Ryoji's birthday and tried not to stare at the bedroom door.  
明日香躺在床上，真嗣完成了司令的餐点，并将她的那份放在桌上。他渴望见到她，同时又对此感到恐惧。现实对他破碎的心灵来说显得难以捉摸。为了从日益增长的不确定性中寻求任何形式的慰藉，真嗣专注于为凉二的生日准备每一个细节，并尽量不去盯着卧室的门。

The wind made crimson-golden locks dance in his mind. _Calm, comely, charming. Resplendent_. Her soft words of approval for his efforts, the way she looked so young. Shinji's eyes softened as he focused on the memory, wishing to imprint it in his very soul. Ryoji, Hikari, Toji and Viko had been right all along.  
风在他的脑海中让那绯红金色的发丝舞动。平静、美丽、迷人。灿烂夺目。她对他努力的温柔赞许，她看起来如此年轻的样子。真嗣的眼神柔和下来，他专注于这段记忆，希望将其铭刻在自己的灵魂深处。凉二、光、剑介和维克说得没错。

_Beautiful.  美丽。_

Koga had hidden away the pieces and promised they would be ready to unveil when the moment came. Expecting the elusive Second Child to attend the festivities was foolish. _Just have to get some things ready, and that won't matter all that much. It happened once, already. Come on, Shinji. Work. Build. Help. Earn. No matter what._  
Koga 已经将那些碎片藏了起来，并承诺在时机到来时它们将准备好揭晓。期待那位神秘的第二适格者出席庆典是愚蠢的。只需准备一些东西，那就不那么重要了。已经发生过一次了。来吧，Shinji。工作。建造。帮助。赚取。无论如何。

"I can give you a lift to the center," Kensuke mentioned over his shoulder whilst storing the meal in his bag. "Looks like it's gonna be a bit cold today!"  
“我可以载你去中心，”Kensuke 一边把食物放进包里一边回头说道，“今天看起来会有点冷！”

"Yeah, I hope it doesn't rain," Shinji responded. "It's not cloudy, at least."  
“是啊，希望别下雨，”真嗣回答，“至少现在还没什么云。”

"Nah, no way it's gonna rain on Ryoji's birthday. You can forget about that!" Kensuke laughed as he loaded the hastily wrapped present on the backseat. "Viko would set the forest on fire as protest! Time to go! Got everything you need?"  
“不会的，怎么可能赶在望月生日这天下雨呢？你想多了！”健介笑着把匆忙包装好的礼物放到后座上，“维克会抗议到把森林都点着的！该出发了！都准备好了吗？”

The roundels gleamed from their perch. A gift, a part of her. _And still I can't muster up the courage to ask about those nice roundels. How she got the cap, how long she's had it. Coward. Asuka gave you that gift. Be strong. Have courage._ Hesitant, Shinji decided to grab the cap and carefully place it in his backpack. The small pirate insignia emboldened him, fueled his being in a way only the fight against the Ninth Angel had. _Courage._  
那些圆徽章在它们的位置上闪闪发光。一份礼物，她的一部分。而我仍无法鼓起勇气去询问那些漂亮的圆徽章。她是怎么得到那顶帽子的，她拥有它多久了。懦夫。是明日香给你的这份礼物。要坚强。要有勇气。犹豫中，真嗣决定拿起那顶帽子，小心翼翼地放进背包里。小小的海盗徽章让他鼓起了勇气，以一种只有对抗第九使徒时才有的方式激励着他。勇气。

"Yeah." He nodded, and was about to follow Kensuke into the car when the bedroom door opened.  
“嗯。”他点头，正要跟着真希进车里，这时卧室门开了。

"Hey!" “嘿！”

A package of protein bars flew through the living room. Shinji caught it, shocked his reflexes had acted so quickly. Asuka peeked out from the room, clad in little but the jacket and some undergarments. His face heated, his eyes drifted to the floor on his left to avoid staring.  
一包蛋白棒从客厅飞了过来。真嗣接住了它，惊讶于自己的反应如此迅速。明日香从房间里探出头来，只穿着夹克和一些内衣。他的脸颊发烫，眼睛不由自主地瞥向左边，避免直视。

"Eat, you idiot." Asuka grumbled, and turned back to the bed. "See ya later," she told Kensuke. "And _you_," her eye narrowed in his direction. "Eat."  
“吃吧，你个傻瓜。”明日香咕哝着，转身回到床上。“回头见。”她对健介说。“还有你，”她的目光锐利地射向他。“吃。”

The trance deepened. Lightheaded, Shinji stumbled to the car and held the rations close to his chest once he was strapped to his seat. The village leader's remarks and the engine melded into white noise. Something shimmering atop the rations caught his eye. A small piece of paper clung to the red wrapper of what looked to be chocolate.  
恍惚感加深了。头晕目眩的 Shinji 跌跌撞撞地走向汽车，一旦系好安全带，他就将补给品紧紧抱在胸前。村长的讲话和引擎声融合成了白噪音。有什么东西在补给品顶上闪闪发光。一张小纸片粘在看似巧克力的红色包装上。

He threw a furtive glance at Kensuke. The man's attention was on the unstable road, so he hastily unpacked the small note and held it between shivering fingers.  
他偷偷瞥了一眼健介。那人的注意力集中在不稳定的道路上，于是他急忙拆开小纸条，用颤抖的手指夹住。

'_Don't feel like giving the brat anything. You can say the penguin is from both of us. If you share that or show this to anyone I'll punch you in the face.'_  
'不想给那小鬼任何东西。你可以说这企鹅是我们俩送的。如果你泄露这个或者给别人看，我就揍你一顿。'

The language on the wrapper was foreign. Gilded letters shone under the morning sun, enticing. Shinji's fingers moved on their own, caution dismissed, and he devoured the small treat before logic returned. His eyes closed as the flavors danced and mingled like one of the musical pieces he liked. The letters blurred.  
包装纸上的文字是外文的。金色的字母在晨光下闪闪发光，诱人无比。真嗣的手指不由自主地动了起来，谨慎被抛诸脑后，他迅速吞下了那小巧的甜点，直到理智回归。他的眼睛闭上，味觉如同他喜爱的乐曲般跳跃交织。字母变得模糊。

"You okay over there?" The car halted for a moment. Kensuke's gaze became slightly concerned. "You're crying, Shinji. Is everything okay?"  
“你还好吗？”车子停顿了一下。 Kensuke 的目光变得略带关切。“你在哭，真嗣。一切都好吗？”

_Mend,_ he thought. The wound that stung so deeply in his chest since his father's abandonment closed a tiny fraction. _To restore to health. To put into good shape or working order again._  
治愈，他想。自从父亲抛弃他以来，胸口那深深刻骨的伤痛稍稍愈合了一些。恢复健康。重新变得完好或恢复正常运作。

"I think so," he said, hugging the rations close. His hand pressed the wrapper against his chest. "Kensuke." Despite the tears still cascading down, his voice was firm. "Thank you. For everything."  
“我想是的，”他说，紧紧抱着补给品。他的手将包装纸按在胸前。“健介。”尽管泪水仍在流淌，他的声音却坚定。“谢谢你。为了这一切。”

Kensuke's eyes drifted to the barrier and the sky. "You're going, then?"  
健介的目光飘向屏障和天空。“你就要走了，是吗？”

Shinji shook his head. "I don't know. But I wanted to thank you, regardless."  
真嗣摇了摇头。“我不知道。但无论如何，我想谢谢你。”

"Don't mention it," the commander replied with an easy smile. The car moved again, shaking under the unsteady terrain. "You like her, don't you?"  
“别客气，”指挥官轻松地笑着回答。车子再次启动，在不平坦的地形下颠簸。“你喜欢她，对吧？”

The car hit a rock and shook both occupants, drowning out his whispered reply.  
车子撞上一块石头，猛地颠簸了一下，淹没了他的低声回应。

---

"What a waste of my god damn time."  
"真是浪费我他妈的时间。"

A man's harsh grunt alerted her whilst washing the cups Shinji had crafted. Her hands stilled, eyes drawn to the man shooing away the penguins as he rubbed his nose and drank from a large bottle of brown liquid. In his free hand, a device beeped every few seconds, and every time he glanced at it, another large swig of the bottle followed.  
一个男人粗鲁的哼声在她清洗真嗣制作的杯子时引起了她的注意。她的手停了下来，目光被那个赶走企鹅、揉着鼻子、从一大瓶棕色液体中喝着酒的男人吸引。他空着的那只手里，一个设备每隔几秒就发出哔哔声，每当他瞥一眼时，就会紧接着又大口喝上一口。

The stench of alcohol overpowered the smooth sea breeze and the comfortable scent of burnt wood. The man stumbled and almost stepped on the penguin leader. Something boiled in her loins, a fire that worsened when the man's boot crushed one of Shinji's least preferred cups, one he used for himself.  
酒精的恶臭盖过了柔和的海风和烧焦木头的舒适香气。那男人踉跄了一下，差点踩到企鹅首领。一股怒火在她体内沸腾，当那男人的靴子碾碎了真嗣不怎么喜欢的一个杯子，那是他留给自己用的，怒火更甚了。

"Huh? What's the Major supposed to be doing in this bunch of rubble?" Old, she assumed, about forty years of age. A full, dirty beard obscured the face, while the eyes, squinted and unfocused, glared at the screen on his palm. "Ugh, cheap ass sake. Can't even brew a decent drink in this hell," the brute stumbled and almost fell over Shinji's small brazier and oven. "What is all this _crap_?"  
"嗯？少校在这种废墟里应该做什么？" 她猜测他年纪不小了，大约四十岁左右。一张满是污垢的胡子遮住了脸，而那双眯着、无焦点的眼睛则瞪着他掌中的屏幕。"呸，劣质烧酒。这地狱里连一杯像样的酒都酿不出来，" 那粗汉踉跄了一下，差点撞翻了真嗣的小火炉和烤箱。"这都是些什么垃圾？"

_Crap?_ Her body trembled, fists curled tight as she hid behind a broken-down wall. _These are small efforts to bring us all closer together. These are his tools, made with his very hands. Touch them no more._  
垃圾？她的身体颤抖着，拳头紧握，躲在一堵倒塌的墙后。这些都是让我们团结起来的小小努力。这些都是他用双手制作的工具。不要再碰它们了。

"Pfft, is this supposed to be an 's'? Like in Shinji Ikari?" The man spat on the ground and slammed the cup against the ground, where it broke into a thousand pieces. "If I could just get my hands on that brat, the things I'd do…"  
"噗，这是不是该念成'真嗣'的'嗣'？" 那人朝地上吐了口唾沫，将杯子猛地摔在地上，碎成了无数片。"要是我能抓住那小子，我会让他尝尝我的手段……"

The largest cup, the one Shinji mixed the spices or prepared the sauce in, was hurled into the wall next to her head. _Stop._ Her breath came in quick huffs, mind going blank with anger when the next cup to be grasped by his greasy fingers was hers. _Stop touching his belongings._ _**Our**_ _belongings. You have no right to taint our precious memories._  
最大的那个杯子，正是真嗣用来混合香料或调制酱料的，被猛地掷向她头旁的墙壁。停下。她的呼吸急促，怒火中烧，脑海一片空白，当他的油腻手指抓起下一个杯子时，那是她的。别碰他的东西。我们的东西。你没有权利玷污我们珍贵的回忆。

"Hey!" “嘿！”

Shinji's voice thundered over the building. The penguins aligned behind, squawking in outrage as the leader waddled just behind the Third Child. Her body shook once more; the size and weight disparities were too obvious.  
真嗣的声音在建筑物中轰鸣。企鹅们紧随其后，发出抗议的叫声，而领头的企鹅摇摇摆摆地跟在第三适格者身后。她的身体再次颤抖；体型和重量上的差异太过明显。

"Sir! Excuse me, but can you please let that cup go?" Shinji approached in quick strides, with the request sounding more like a demand. "It belongs to someone important. Can you please be careful?"  
“长官！打扰一下，请您放开那个杯子好吗？” 真嗣快步上前，语气更像是在命令。“它属于某位重要人物。请您小心些。”

"Well, I'll be damned." The man let the cup slide from his grasp. It landed near the fireplace, cracking a bit but not breaking. He took several gulps from the stinking drink. "No wonder this damn thing brought me here. It was following _your_ collar, not the Major's."  
“见鬼了。”男人松开手，杯子滑落，在壁炉旁裂开了一点，但没有破碎。他猛灌了几口那散发着恶臭的饮料。“难怪这该死的东西把我带到这里。它是跟着你的领子，不是跟着少校的。”

Shinji's hand shot up to his neck. Tension stifled the air. The penguins stood on high alert and looked ready to dash out into the ocean at any moment. She remained hidden, too overwhelmed by the scorching emotions.  
真嗣的手猛地摸向自己的脖子。紧张的气氛压抑着空气。企鹅们高度戒备，似乎随时准备冲向大海。她仍躲藏着，被炽烈的情感压得喘不过气来。

"This is where you come play house, then?" She recognized the insignia on the man's arm as that of the WUNDER's crew. "We drink distilled piss, eat tasteless bars of soap, and stink in our own filth up there for years on end and you sit here, fishing and watching the sunset. Isn't that precious?"  
"这就是你来玩过家家的地方吗？" 她认出了男人手臂上的徽章，那是 WUNDER 号船员的标志。"我们在上面喝着蒸馏尿，吃着无味的肥皂条，常年在污秽中自臭，而你却坐在这里钓鱼看日落。真是太可爱了。"

Instantly recoiling at the words, Shinji's gaze drifted to the floor, clenched hands laying at each side. "Anything you need to do, do it to me, please. Leave that alone."  
听到这些话，瞬间退缩的 Shinji 目光转向地板，紧握的双手分别放在两侧。"任何你需要做的事，请对我做，求你了。别碰那个。"

"Oh, look at you... giving orders and everything, are we?" Another swig, and a finger was pointed at Shinji. "Everything, every last part of this hell is your fault, you little brat. We should've skinned you alive the moment that Eva spat you out."  
"哦，看看你...发号施令起来了，是吧？" 又喝了一口，手指指向 Shinji。"这一切，这个地狱的每一个角落都是你的错，你这个小鬼。当初那个 Eva 把你吐出来时，我们就该活剥了你。"

"I know it's my fault," replied Shinji. "I know. But please, leave that alone. I'm trying… I'm trying to help however I can. I'm try-"  
"我知道这是我的错，" 真嗣回答道，"我知道。但请别再提了。我正在努力……尽我所能地帮忙。我正在努-"

"You're trying? You're trying!" The man erupted in sarcastic laughter. Sickness was the next emotion to simmer in her belly. "Hah! That's the best joke I've heard in months! So you fish here, huh? Cook this for that Ayanami Series clone? That's what you do? You play with clay like a child while we _rot_ up there? How valorous of the great Third Child! You think I'm the only one up there who wants you dead, brat?"  
"你在努力？你在努力！" 那人爆发出讽刺的笑声。紧接着，一股厌恶感在她腹中翻腾。"哈！这是我几个月来听过的最好笑的笑话！所以你在这里钓鱼，是吧？为了那个绫波系列克隆人做饭？你就这么玩泥巴像个孩子，而我们却在上面腐烂？伟大的第三适格者真是英勇！你以为我是唯一一个想让你死在上面的，小子？"

A foot was about to crush Asuka's cup when her body reacted. She pushed the stranger away and made him stumble, drunk as he was.  
当一只脚即将踩碎明日香的杯子时，她的身体本能地做出了反应。她推开了那个陌生人，让他踉跄后退，尽管他醉醺醺的。

"Wha-oh, isn't this just about perfect?" She fell on the floor with naught but a small shove and a snarl. "I forgot they were housing one of _you_ freaks in here, as well."  
"哇哦，这不是刚刚好吗？" 她被轻轻一推，伴随着一声咆哮就摔在了地上。"我忘了他们这里还收容了你们这些怪胎之一。"

"Leave her alone!" "别碰她！"

Shinji rushed them with enough momentum to push the outsider away from both her and their small dining area. Ruffling, the horrible sound of more ceramic and clay breaking, a grunt and the stench of alcohol.  
真嗣冲向他们，用力之大足以将外人从她和他们的小餐厅推开。一阵混乱，更多陶瓷和陶器破碎的可怕声音，一声闷哼和酒精的臭味。

"Get off me, you little brat!"  
"从我身上滚开，你这个小鬼！"

However, Shinji was fighting someone as big as the forge master, who picked both himself and the boy off the ground and threw Shinji like a rag doll. The backpack he had been carrying went flying, picked by the man's sake-coated hand.  
然而，真嗣正在与一个和锻造大师一样魁梧的人搏斗，那人将他和男孩一起从地上抓起，像扔破布娃娃一样把真嗣扔了出去。他背着的背包被那人沾满酒的手一挥，飞了出去。

"What's all this you got here, huh? You're doing chores, is that what you're doing? While we're out fighting monsters, you're doing chores?" The tracksuit top, SDAT two bentos and Asuka's cap cascaded to the floor. Both her and the man's eyes widened at the last item. "How do you have this? This belongs to the Major. Come here, come here!"  
"你这里都藏了些什么，嗯？你在做家务，是吗？当我们在外面与怪物战斗时，你在做家务？"运动衫、SDAT 播放器、两个便当盒和明日香的帽子纷纷散落在地板上。看到最后一件物品时，她和那人的眼睛都瞪大了。"你怎么会有这个？这是属于少校的。过来，过来！"

Shinji was picked by the scruff of his shirt and almost lifted off the ground. "Let me go! Don't touch that! Get your dirty hands off it! Asuka gave that to me!" He tried in vain to strike at the beard, the eyes, the throat, all on vain, while she sat on the floor, paralyzed. "Let it go!"  
真嗣被揪住衣领，几乎双脚离地。“放开我！别碰那个！把你的脏手拿开！那是明日香给我的！”他徒劳地试图攻击那胡须、眼睛、喉咙，却无一成功，而她则瘫坐在地板上，动弹不得。“放手！”

"Go to hell, you useless runt!" Shinji flew through the air a second time, impacting heavily on the concrete. "This is property of the Second Child. You think I'm stupid enough to believe she'd give this to _you_ of all people? Must be so nice, huh. Must be so nice for you freaks. Never aging, never worrying. You have no families, you, the Second, or that _freak_ over there. No loved ones. Your own father turned you into a freak. You can't understand what is like for us."  
“去死吧，没用的废物！”真嗣再次飞了出去，重重地摔在水泥地上。“这是二号机的财产。你以为我会蠢到相信她会把这东西给你这种人？一定很爽吧，嗯？对你们这些怪物来说一定很爽。永不衰老，永不担忧。你们没有家庭，你、二号机，还是那边的怪物。没有亲人。你自己的父亲把你变成了怪物。你无法理解我们是什么感受。”

It took several moments for Shinji to move. She noticed a bruise on the side of his head, where it had impacted the ground. _Move. Fight._ She urged her body, yet it remained motionless. _Help him._  
真嗣过了好一会儿才动弹。她注意到他头部着地的地方有一块淤青。动起来。战斗。她催促着自己的身体，却依旧纹丝不动。去帮他。

"M-Maybe I can't," Shinji uttered as he shakily rose to his feet. "But whatever your grudge is, it's with me. Give that back, and leave Rei alone."  
“也许我做不到，”真嗣颤抖着站起身来，“但无论你有什么恩怨，都冲我来。把那东西还给我，放过绫波。”

Her hands stilled. Rei. That was her name.  
她的手停了下来。绫波，那是她的名字。

"As if, runt." The man collected his bottle, grunting as he noticed most of it had spilled. He drank whatever was left and produced a pocket knife. "I'm so damn tired of treating that ageless pain in the ass like my superior, just because she can pilot that hunk of junk. Been waiting a long time for this."  
“想得美，小鬼。”男人收拾起他的酒瓶，注意到大部分已经洒了，咕哝了一声。他喝掉剩下的酒，掏出一把折叠刀，“我他妈受够了把那个永远不老的麻烦精当上级对待，就因为她能驾驶那堆破铜烂铁。我等这一刻已经很久了。”

The knife cut clean through the soft material, tearing it almost in half in a single slash. Before Shinji crashed against him again, the man was able to rip whatever remained of it to shreds with his hands. The victory was short-lived, as this time it was his head that bounced of the concrete once, twice, thrice as punches rained down his face.  
刀刃干净利落地划过柔软的材质，几乎一击将其劈成两半。在真嗣再次撞向他之前，那人用手将剩余的部分撕成了碎片。然而胜利转瞬即逝，这次是他的头在水泥地上弹起，一次，两次，三次，拳头如雨点般落在他的脸上。

"I told you to stop!" Shinji bellowed. For a moment, he overpowered the heavier adult. "Don't _ever_ insult either of them again! How dare you call them freaks?" Another punch landed and sent a tooth flying. "I told you to stop! I _begged_ you! Why didn't you listen, huh? Why do you have to keep taking away what's important to me!"  
“我告诉过你停下！”真嗣咆哮道。有那么一刻，他压倒了体重更重的成年人。“不要再侮辱他们中的任何一个！你怎么敢叫他们怪胎？”又一拳落下，打飞了一颗牙齿。“我告诉过你停下！我求过你！你为什么不听，嗯？为什么你非要夺走对我重要的东西！”

"Enough!" “够了！”

The man came to his senses and sunk his boot in Shinji's midsection, hovering over the youth as he struggled to breathe. He spat a pinkish glob, knelt and reared back his fist. "The captain only ever said 'alive'," he whispered. The tone of his voice sent shivers down her spine. "I've been waiting too long for this. Gotta make sure to enjoy it."  
男人回过神来，一脚踹在真嗣的腹部，俯视着挣扎呼吸的少年。他吐出一口粉红色的唾沫，跪下并举起拳头。“队长只说过要留活口，”他低声说道。他的语气让她不寒而栗。“我等这一刻太久了。得确保好好享受。”

"Keep waiting then. You're not gonna enjoy a damn thing."  
“那就继续等吧。你什么也享受不到。”

Rei turned to her right to see the Second Child stand next to her, aiming some sort of weapon at the man.  
绫波转向右边，看到二号机驾驶员站在她旁边，正用某种武器瞄准那人。

"But I am." "但我是。"

Tremors shook the man's body an instant later. He convulsed and fell to the side, away from Shinji, and at last her body responded. She rushed to him, unsure of what to do once Shinji started getting back to his feet.  
颤抖随即席卷了男人的身体。他抽搐着，侧身倒下，远离了真嗣，而她的身体终于有了反应。她冲向他，不确定一旦真嗣开始站起身来该做什么。

Asuka kept her finger on the trigger long after the immediate had danger passed. Even as her prey tried to get on his hands and knees, her foot pushed his face against the ground.  
危险过去许久后，明日香仍将手指扣在扳机上。即便她的猎物试图用手和膝盖撑起身体，她的脚仍将他的脸压在地上。

"Who told you you could put your dirty hands on my property, or my prisoner?" She crouched, and Rei felt terror when something underneath the eye-patch glistened. "Touch him again," she growled. "And it'll be the last thing you ever do."  
"谁允许你用那双脏手碰我的财产，或是我的囚犯？" 她蹲下身，雷伊感到恐惧，因为眼罩下有什么东西在闪烁。"再碰他一下，" 她咆哮道，"那将是你做的最后一件事。"

"There he is! Ah, god damn it!"  
"他就在那儿！该死的！"

"Ken, Viko, hurry it up!"  
"肯，维科，快点！"

Toji's voice rang out from behind them as Rei helped Shinji into a sitting position. The village leader, botanist expert, and local doctor surrounded them in seconds. All three men shook their heads at the brute lying on the ground.  
当丽帮助真嗣坐起身时，冬治的声音从他们身后传来。村长、植物学专家和当地医生在几秒钟内围了上来。三个人都对着躺在地上的粗鲁家伙摇了摇头。

"Koga's cousin," Asuka announced, foot still pressed on the unconscious crew member's cheek. "I hope the three of you understand that's the _only_ reason he's still breathing. Insubordination, not following orders, threatening WUNDER property. Shooting block has his name all over it."  
“虎王的表弟，”明日香宣布，脚仍踩在失去意识的船员脸上。“我希望你们三个明白，他还能呼吸的唯一原因就是这个。不服从命令，不遵守指令，威胁 WUNDER 的财产。射击场就是为他量身定做的。”

Her animalistic glare focused on the village commander. "Get him out of my sight. Not a word from you, _Kensuke_. Not a god damn word. I hold you entirely responsible for this."  
她那野兽般的目光紧盯着村庄指挥官。“把他从我视线中弄走。你一句话也别说，健介。一个字也别说。我完全要你为此负责。”

The usually talkative duo said nothing as both Viko and Kensuke lifted the man off the ground and carried him away. Toji lingered for a moment. She noticed how his gaze went from her and Shinji to the redhead, how his hands clenched and relaxed at his sides. He lay a small kit next to Asuka's feet.  
平时喋喋不休的两人此时一言不发，Viko 和 Kensuke 将那人从地上抬起，带离了现场。Toji 停留了一会儿。她注意到他的目光从她和 Shinji 转向了红发女孩，他的双手紧握又放松在身体两侧。他在 Asuka 脚边放下了一个小包。

"You've got this handled, right?" he asked.  
"你搞得定吧？"他问道。

"What the hell do you think?" Asuka snapped with enough harshness to make him take a step back. "Go on, get on out of here. You've all got that dumb party to finish planning."  
"你以为呢？"Asuka 厉声反问，语气之严厉让他不由得后退了一步。"走吧，离开这里。你们还得继续筹备那愚蠢的派对。"

Toji left in silence, and the moment he was out of sight Rei witnessed the same strange occurrence from days before; the mask of rage melting yet again. Still unsure of what to do, all she had done was hold onto Shinji's arm as he sat on the ground, head bowed.  
冬二默默地离开了，而当他消失在视线之外时，丽再次目睹了几天前那奇怪的一幕；愤怒的面具再次融化。她仍然不确定该怎么做，只是紧紧抓住真嗣的手臂，他坐在地上，头低垂着。

Asuka's hands moved to Shinji's head the moment she crouched beside them. Rei watched, enthralled, as her hands softly inspected the bruised areas around the forehead and the back of the skull. It almost felt like she was ruffling his hair.  
明日香一蹲在他们旁边，手就移到了真嗣的头上。丽看着，被深深吸引，她的手轻轻检查着额头和后脑勺周围的淤青部位。感觉就像她在轻轻地拨弄他的头发。

"Nothing broken." Asuka's eye went over the many shattered pieces of clay. "Well, almost nothing."  
“没有骨折。”明日香的目光扫过许多破碎的陶片。“嗯，几乎什么都没断。”

"It's fine," Shinji spoke in a quiet, yet firm voice. "I can make new ones. Better ones. I'm just… y-your cap-"  
"没事的，" 真嗣用平静而坚定的声音说道。"我可以做新的。更好的。我只是……你的帽……"

"Bah." Dabbing a piece of gauze in fresh water, Asuka pressed it against the small bruise beside Shinji's temple. "It's a stupid hat. I never liked it in the first place, it was too damn uncomfortable. Kept the the roundels in place, though."  
"哼。" 用一块纱布蘸上清水，明日香按在真嗣太阳穴旁的小瘀伤上。"那是个愚蠢的帽子。我一开始就不喜欢它，太他妈不舒服了。不过倒是固定住了圆形徽章。"

Blood droplets fell on her thigh as she held Shinji's injured hand. Rei inspected the cut, tiny but deep, atop his knuckles. Asuka sprayed water all over Shinji's other arm. He had landed on it one of the times the man had thrown him to the ground, resulting in a few scratches around his elbow and forearm.  
血滴落在她的大腿上，她握着真嗣受伤的手。绫波检查着他拳头上虽小却深的伤口。明日香用水喷洒着真嗣另一只手臂。他曾几次被那人摔在地上，其中一次手臂着地，导致肘部和前臂周围有些擦伤。

"Look at you, weren't you supposed to be looking your best for the Katsuragi spawn?"  
"看看你，不是应该为了神木家的孩子打扮得最漂亮吗？"

"I'm sorry," Shinji muttered. His head hung lower, unable, or unwilling to look at either girl. "I tried to… I tried to do something."  
"对不起，" 真嗣喃喃道。他的头垂得更低了，无法或不愿看向两位女孩。"我试着……我试着做点什么。"

She heard his breath hitch after Asuka took the injured hand from her hold and began cleaning the cut. Her visible eye held emotions she had yet to identify. Anger was unexplainably absent, and so was most of the yearning and misery. _It feels like… approval. Pride._  
她听到他的呼吸在明日香从她手中接过受伤的手并开始清理伤口后哽住了。她那只看得见的眼睛里蕴含着她尚未辨明的情绪。愤怒莫名地缺席了，渴望和痛苦也大多不见了。感觉像是……认可。自豪。

Rei nodded to herself and forced her legs to work. She collected the remnants of the hat, and the broken cups, placing them beside Shinji. A few renegade tears escaped his eyes, yet he did not weep. _Is one supposed to hold him, now? How does one- Oh._  
丽自顾自地点了点头，强迫自己的双腿动起来。她收拾起帽子的残骸和破碎的杯子，放在真嗣旁边。几滴叛逆的泪水从他眼中滑落，但他没有哭泣。现在应该抱住他吗？一个人该怎么做——哦。

When the cut was clean, Asuka's hands went to Shinji's face and held it upwards. She still seemed to be checking for injuries, crouched and basically hovering over him. Then, Asuka placed her forehead against his, and closed her eye. Shinji's labored breaths quieted and faded away as she remained in that position, hands lost in his locks.  
伤口处理干净后，明日香的手伸向真嗣的脸，将他的头抬起来。她似乎仍在检查伤势，蹲着，几乎悬在他上方。接着，明日香将额头贴在他的额头上，闭上了眼睛。随着她保持这个姿势，真嗣沉重的呼吸逐渐平息，她的手也消失在他的发丝中。

_Affection. A gentle feeling of fondness and liking. A tender attachment.  
爱意。一种温柔的喜爱和喜欢的感觉。一种温柔的依恋。_

"Not bad, you idiot," Asuka murmured. "Not bad at all." She grabbed the biggest piece of the cap and removed the blue roundel, attaching it on Shinji's damaged shirt. "I don't have any medals on me, so this'll have to suffice. I'm taking this one, though." She placed the red one near her collarbone. "If you want it back, you have to earn it."  
“不错嘛，你这个笨蛋。”明日香喃喃道，“相当不错。”她抓起头盔最大的一块碎片，取下上面的蓝色圆徽，贴在真嗣破损的衬衫上。“我身上没有勋章，所以这个就凑合了。不过这个红色的我要留下。”她将红色圆徽放在自己的锁骨旁，“如果你想拿回去，就得自己挣回来。”

_Despite the stress of the situation, she smiles. The Second Child smiles in the face of adversity, that is when she shines the brightest. A flame to guide him through the shadows.  
尽管处境紧张，她还是笑了。面对逆境时，二号机驾驶员的笑容最为耀眼。那是引领他穿越阴影的火焰。_

Relief flooded her senses. The time was nigh, not even all the syringes in the world would suffice. A peaceful hum erased the tense fear, anger and uncertainty from earlier.  
她感到一阵释然。时机已至，即便全世界的注射器也无济于事。平和的嗡鸣声驱散了之前的紧张、恐惧、愤怒和不确定。

"But that's the one I like the most," Shinji said, sounding chastised. His voice made her burst into quiet giggles, and drew a smirk on Asuka's features. "How can I earn it back?"  
"但这是我最喜欢的那顶。" 真嗣说道，听起来有些受责备。他的声音让她忍不住轻声笑了出来，也让明日香嘴角勾起了一丝微笑。"我怎样才能把它赢回来呢？"

"I don't know yet. For now, though, go get changed." Asuka picked up the fallen bentos and pushed one in her direction. She sat opposite to Rei, legs crossed, as she produced a box of her own from the jacket. "I'll keep my eye on this one."  
"我还不知道。不过现在，去换衣服吧。" 明日香捡起掉落的便当盒，推了一个到她面前。她盘腿坐在绫波对面，从夹克里拿出了自己的便当盒。"我会盯着这个的。"

"Thank you," Shinji began to walk away, stopped, turned, walked two steps further and stopped again. She chuckled when he took a deep breath and almost marched back. "Asuka, thank you. Really. I'm very sorry about the hat. I'll do my best to… to earn back the roundel."  
"谢谢你。" 真嗣开始走开，停下，转身，又走了两步再次停下。她轻笑出声，只见他深吸一口气，几乎像是迈着正步走了回来。"明日香，谢谢你。真的。我为那顶帽子感到非常抱歉。我会尽我最大的努力……赢回那个徽章。"

"Pfft, sure, whatever." Asuka shrugged. "I'll check on that cut and your dumb head before the stupid party begins."  
“噗，随便啦。”明日香耸耸肩，“在那个蠢派对开始前，我会先检查一下你的伤口和你那笨脑袋。”

Even when she could not see it, Shinji bowed and hurried back to the train station, taking the discarded pieces of the cap in his backpack.  
即使看不见，真嗣还是鞠了一躬，匆匆赶回火车站，把那顶帽子的碎片塞进了背包。

Both female pilots remained, each nibbling from their respective bentos as the acrid odor of liquor washed away with the ocean breeze. Her eyes lingered on the remains of Shinji's cup, and her own, broken at the base, where the water had long since leaked out.  
两位女驾驶员依旧留在原地，各自小口吃着便当，随着海风，酒精的刺鼻气味逐渐消散。她的目光停留在真嗣的杯子残骸上，还有她自己的，底座破碎，水早已漏光。

"It will not be long now," Rei murmured between bites. She mirrored Asuka and prolonged every nibble. "Thank you. Will you look after him, when I am gone?"  
"不久就会到了，" 丽在咀嚼间低声说道。她模仿着明日香，延长了每一次的轻咬。"谢谢你。当我离开后，你会照顾他吗？"

"Can't promise that," Asuka replied. Her thumb pointed at the path to the train station. "It's all on him and what he chooses to do."  
"我不能保证，" 明日香回答道。她的拇指指向通往火车站的路。"一切都取决于他自己和他选择做什么。"

_You still have doubt. How… troublesome,_ she considered with a frown. "And _when_ he makes the correct decision, will you follow those inefficient emotions? Will you look after him?"  
你仍有疑虑。这……真是麻烦，她皱着眉头想。"当他做出正确的决定时，你会跟随那些无用的情感吗？你会照顾他吗？"

"What are you, stupid?" rebuked Asuka with a flick of her hair. "Have I not been doing that, already? Get back to your meal, Rei."  
"你是不是傻？" 明日香甩了甩头发责备道，"我不是一直在做吗？回去吃饭吧，丽。"

---

He scrubbed the cut on his knuckles with urgency until blood stopped dripping out.  
他急切地搓洗着拳头上割伤的地方，直到血不再滴落。

The skin of his palms, elbows and knees was raw and stung as water poured over it. Scratches and small bruises made themselves known once the adrenaline wore off, driving all sorts of aches and pains up and down his body. Anger, discontent, confusion and sadness mingled in his chest once he toweled off and dressed.  
水流冲刷过他的手掌、手肘和膝盖，粗糙的皮肤刺痛不已。当肾上腺素消退后，划痕和小瘀伤开始显现，全身各处都传来各种疼痛。当他擦干身体并穿上衣服时，愤怒、不满、困惑和悲伤在他胸中交织。

Standing alone in the middle of the tiny kitchen, Shinji's fingers traced the DSS choker. Kaworu's death, which had evaded him for so many days, washed over him along with the memories of his confinement in WILLE. The short time spent in the WUNDER followed. Eyes filled with hate, so deep and rotten that it had been palpable even in his broken state.  
独自站在狭小的厨房中央，真嗣的手指抚过 DSS 项圈。数日来一直逃避的薰的死亡，连同在 WILLE 中被囚禁的记忆一起涌上心头。随后是在 WUNDER 上的短暂时光。眼中充满了仇恨，如此深沉腐朽，即便在他破碎的状态下也清晰可感。

He wandered through the halls of the WUNDER, hands bound, following a figure clad in red. Kaworu's body exploded again, yet he did not retch, nor did he fall to his knees to hyperventilate or curl into a ball. Instead, Shinji reached for the roundel resting on the table and focused on its crimson center.  
他徘徊在 WUNDER 的走廊中，双手被缚，跟随一个身着红衣的身影。薰的身体再次爆炸，但他既没有呕吐，也没有跪地急促呼吸或蜷缩成一团。相反，真嗣伸手去拿桌上的圆形徽章，专注于它鲜红的中心。

_I always knew they were out there, and that they would come for me. I always knew that's what I deserve, that this life here was too good to be true. Why don't I feel sorry, then? Why don't I feel ashamed to have hurt that man?  
我始终知道他们就在那里，终将来找我。我始终明白这是我应得的，这里的生活太过美好，不可能是真的。那么，为何我感受不到歉意？为何我伤害了那个人却不感到羞愧？_

"A medal." The words were quiet, yet echoed like a scream in the empty house. Shinji picked up the dictionary and sat on the table, red marker in hand. "A piece of metal often resembling a coin and having a stamped design." The roundel danced in between the fingers of his injured hand. "That is issued to commemorate a person or event or awarded for… excellence or achievement."  
“一枚勋章。” 声音虽轻，却在空荡的屋内回响如尖叫。真嗣拿起字典，坐在桌子上，手里握着红色记号笔。“一种常似硬币且带有压印图案的金属制品。”圆形徽章在他受伤的手指间跳动。“为纪念某人或事件而发行，或因……卓越或成就而颁发。”

"_I don't have any medals on me."_  
“我身上没有勋章。”

"But you do," he whispered next. There was another sensation, one that overpowered the shame, anger and fear. "And you gave me one."  
“但你确实有，”他低声接着说。另一种感觉压倒了羞耻、愤怒和恐惧。“而你给了我一枚。”

Eyes closed, he recalled the scent of strawberry, fresh water and LCL, the warmth of her skin as it just barely touched his. Her fingers lost in his hair, almost caressing, soothing. Elation akin to what he had felt the first, and only time his father had acknowledged his existence.  
闭上双眼，他回想起草莓的香气、清新的水和 LCL 的味道，以及她肌肤传来的微暖触感。她的手指迷失在他的发间，近乎抚慰，令人安心。那种喜悦，如同父亲第一次也是唯一一次认可他存在时的感觉。

_It's coming. I can feel it. Why can't I bring myself to think about it, then? How is my pathetic effort worthy of any sort of recognition?  
它即将来临。我能感觉到。可为何我无法让自己去思考它呢？我这可怜的努力，又怎配得上任何形式的认可？_

The soft fabric of what remained of the hat was placed in a pocket of the red jacket. It would be foolish to wear the roundel; it could fall off, get scratched or incite another pointless confrontation. He stored the pin next to his SDAT, which upon inspection was sporting a small new scratch, but otherwise functioned as before.  
那顶残存的帽子柔软的布料被放入红色夹克的口袋中。佩戴那个圆徽章是愚蠢的；它可能会掉落，被刮花，或引发另一场无谓的冲突。他将别针存放在 SDAT 旁边，检查时发现 SDAT 上新增了一道小划痕，但其他功能依旧如常。

_Today is Ryoji's day. And you have something… something that you want to give to someone very special. Viko says if I blink, I'll miss the good moments as they pass me by. I won't allow that to happen ever again.  
今天是亮司的日子。你有些东西……想送给某个非常特别的人。维科说，如果我眨眼，就会错过那些美好的瞬间。我再也不会让这种事发生了。_

Again, Shinji closed his eyes, and again he was instantly transported to that moment. Asuka's presence beside him, Rei's hands gingerly holding his own. Strength. Comfort.  
真嗣再次闭上眼睛，又一次瞬间回到了那个时刻。明日香在他身边，绫波丽小心翼翼地握着他的手。力量。安慰。

"Maybe Hikari can help me fix the hat, or get another one," he wondered out loud, and hoisted the bag of ingredients over his shoulder. Today was about Ryoji. It was about the villagers, about seeing them smile and filling their bellies with good, warm food. "I know there's gotta be a way t-"  
“也许光可以帮助我修好这顶帽子，或者再弄一顶。”他自言自语道，将一袋食材扛在肩上。今天是为了亮司。是为了村民们，是为了看到他们的笑容，用美味温暖的食物填满他们的肚子。“我知道一定有办法……”

"Leave it," Asuka's voice rang out from the door. He froze and almost dropped the bag. "It's a stupid hat. I can get another one, you can get another one. Stop fussing over spilled milk, you idiot. Come here."  
"别管了，" 明日香的声音从门口传来。他僵住了，差点把包掉在地上。"那是个蠢帽子。我可以再买一个，你也可以再买一个。别为打翻的牛奶烦恼了，你这个白痴。过来。"

Body reacting in an automated trance yet again, he presented himself to Asuka. His face heated for reasons alien to the strikes received earlier when her hands prodded around the bruise near his temple. His hand followed. Asuka wrapped a fine gauze around the nip between his knuckles. His eyes must have fooled him, for what looked like the shadow of a smirk danced on her lips.  
身体再次不由自主地反应，他站在明日香面前。当她的手在他太阳穴附近的瘀伤周围摸索时，他的脸因某种与之前受到的打击无关的原因而发热。他的手跟随着动作。明日香在他指关节间的缝隙处缠上了一层细纱布。他的眼睛一定是看错了，因为她唇边似乎掠过了一丝笑意的阴影。

"The chocolate was incredible," he murmured. _Courage. Courage._ His fingers grasped hers and squeezed for a second. "Best I've ever had."  
"那巧克力真是太棒了，" 他低声说。勇气。勇气。他的手指握住她的，轻轻捏了一下。"我吃过的最好的。"

"Damn right." Asuka tapped at his knuckles and punched his arm in quick succession. She said nothing of his intrusive gesture. "Get out of here, then. You have a cake to prepare. Wear a glove on that hand, and don't get that wound infected, idiot."  
"当然没错。" 明日香轻敲他的指节，随即迅速地捶了下他的手臂。她对他的侵扰举动只字未提。"那就滚吧，你还得准备蛋糕呢。那只手戴上手套，别让伤口感染了，笨蛋。"

"I will," he lingered on the door, hand clenching into a fist. "I… I'd like to talk to you tonight. Would that be okay?"  
"我会去的，" 他在门口徘徊，手紧握成拳。"我……我想今晚和你谈谈。可以吗？"

"What else am I supposed to do? Pretend to sleep?" Asuka asked instead. "Bring me some food when you get back."  
"我还能做什么？装睡吗？" 明日香反问道。"回来时给我带点吃的。"

---

_Look after him? I asked Misato's brat to do that.  
照顾他？我让 Misato 的小鬼去做了。_

Shinji had barely shed any tears after the horrible incident. Luckily for Koga's drunken cousin, nothing short of a few cups had been damaged, with the fireplace remaining unblemished. For a few precious seconds, the idiot had overpowered a man many times his size and weight.  
那场可怕的事故后，真嗣几乎没有流过泪。幸好 Koga 那喝醉的表亲没造成什么大破坏，除了几只杯子外，壁炉也完好无损。有那么宝贵的几秒钟，这个白痴竟然制服了一个比他高大许多的男人。

_What an idiot.  真是个白痴。_

The roundel glistened from its perch next to the SDAT. Slow, boring hours passed as she lay on the mattress and occasionally lifted the blue and purple plush toy to the ceiling. "I've always been alone," she repeated. "It's less painful that way."  
圆徽在其位于 SDAT 旁边的栖息处闪闪发光。她躺在床垫上，时间缓慢而无聊地流逝，偶尔将那只蓝紫色的毛绒玩具举向天花板。“我一直都是一个人，”她重复道，“这样比较不痛苦。”

"_You're smiling."_  “你在微笑。”

"Even good memories hurt," Asuka told the doll. "Everything hurts, all the time." The taste of the morning meal returned, forcing a dry chuckle from her chest. "Fine. Not everything, and not all the time."  
“即使是美好的回忆也会带来痛苦，”明日香对玩偶说道，“一切都在不停地伤害我。”早餐的味道再次涌上心头，迫使她从胸腔中发出一声干笑。“好吧。不是所有事情，也不是一直如此。”

_Talk to me,_ she thought. A frown obscured her features when she touched the plush's head and arm, recalling the red markings around Shinji's arms, the bruise on his temple. The way he had stood his ground, protected what he considered important, and held his composure afterwards forced another tiny smirk to shine on her lips. _Getting bold, are we, Shinji._  
跟我说话，她心想。当她触摸着玩偶的头和手臂时，眉头紧锁，回想起真嗣手臂上的红色痕迹，他太阳穴上的瘀伤。他坚守阵地，保护他认为重要的东西，事后仍保持镇定，这让她嘴角不由得露出一丝微小的笑意。越来越大胆了，是吧，真嗣。

"Treasure." Asuka rose from bed and dressed in the plug suit and military jacket. "What are you, stupid?"  
“珍宝。”明日香从床上起身，穿上插入栓服和军装夹克。“你是不是傻？”

After another glimpse at his sad collection of items, she confirmed the roundel was still where he had left it. The red one he liked so much was hidden away in her duffle bag. _I still haven't decided how he'll earn it. Serves him right, I give him the ridiculous hat and he gets it shredded the first time he takes it with him. Heh, typical._  
再次瞥了一眼他那堆悲伤的收藏品后，她确认那个圆形徽章还在他放的地方。他特别喜欢的那个红色徽章，被她藏在了自己的行李袋里。我还没决定他怎么才能拿回去。活该，我给了他那顶可笑的帽子，结果他第一次带出去就被撕烂了。哼，真是典型。

It was no secret that Shinji was disliked by a significant number of the WUNDER crew. That one of them would cross the line and try to assault him, however, was a new and disturbing occurrence. The rebel faction within their ranks was getting bolder, just as they ran out of time to face Ikari and the ticker neared zero in her head.  
真嗣不受 WUNDER 船员中相当一部分人的待见，这早已不是秘密。然而，其中有人会越界试图攻击他，却是一件新奇且令人不安的事件。他们内部的反叛派别正变得越来越大胆，而他们面对碇和计时器在她脑海中逼近零点的时刻，时间也所剩无几。

"Misato's been informed, can't really do much else from here except keen my eye on that idiot," Asuka told herself while exiting the house. "Even if he's not so fragile, anymore."  
“美里已经得到通知，除了在这里密切关注那个白痴，我也没什么其他能做的了，”明日香一边走出房子一边自言自语，“即使他不再那么脆弱。”

The party was bound to start at sundown, so Asuka thought little of it when her feet dragged her to where the tree was growing. She counted the leaves, squashed a few ants trying to get close to it, and removed the weeds from its direct vicinity.  
派对定于日落时分开始，所以当她的脚步不由自主地把她带到那棵树旁时，明日香并未多想。她数了数树叶，踩扁了几只试图靠近的蚂蚁，并清除了树周围的一些杂草。

"I don't think I'll get to name you," she revealed. "But it was nice to see you grow."  
"我想我可能没法给你起名字了，"她透露道，"但看到你成长真是件美好的事。"

---

"Great, great, this is perfect."  
"太好了，太好了，这简直完美。"

Toji paced through the shack and threw the occasional glare of disgust to the man bound to the only available chair. Viko stood a few feet away from their prisoner, inspecting some of the broken pieces of clay collected from Shinji's fishing spot. His face was unreadable, blank.  
冬二在棚屋里踱步，不时向被绑在唯一一张椅子上的男人投去厌恶的目光。维科站在离囚犯几英尺远的地方，检查着从真嗣钓鱼地点收集来的一些破碎陶片。他的表情难以捉摸，一片空白。

"And it had to be on Ryoji's birthday," Kensuke added tersely. He spared another glance at the blonde. "I'm really sorry about this, Viko."  
"而且偏偏发生在怜司的生日那天，" 健介生硬地补充道。他再次瞥了一眼金发少年。"我真的对此感到抱歉，维克。"

"It's fine," Viko muttered. His gloved hands traced the uneven edges of a shattered cup. "It's terrible that Shinji was hurt. Ryoji and everyone else will notice right away."

"One day," grunted Toji as he circled their prisoner. "We can't have one day. One single day. And to think it wasn't a Wanderer, a malfunction of the L-Barrier, or God forbid, Fourth Impact." He lifted Koga's cousin by the shirt and shook him. "It had to be a drunken sailor. Do you know your cousin helped build those cups you broke? That he likes Shinji, as all of us here in the village do! Did you know that?"  
"就一天，" 东治咕哝着，绕着他们的俘虏转圈。"我们不能有一天，哪怕就一天。想想看，这既不是流浪者，也不是 L 屏障的故障，更不是该死的第四次冲击。" 他揪起高贺的表弟的衬衫摇晃着。"偏偏是个醉酒的水手。你知道你表弟帮忙制作了那些你打碎的杯子吗？他喜欢真嗣，就像我们村里的所有人一样！你知道吗？

"My cousin's a softie and a hypocrite," the man muttered. His tongue traced where an incisor had once been, where blood occasionally trickled down his mouth. "All of you are. Housing a terrorist, a monster, the reason the world is broken," he slurred, and spat next to Toji's foot. "You're all part of the problem, part of the reason this world is _Hell_."  
"我表弟是个软心肠的伪君子，" 那人喃喃道。他的舌头舔过曾经有一颗门牙的地方，那里偶尔会有血从嘴里流出来。"你们都是。收留一个恐怖分子，一个怪物，世界破碎的原因，" 他含糊地说着，朝冬二脚边吐了口唾沫。"你们都是问题的一部分，是这个世界变成地狱的原因之一。"

Kensuke's nails dug into the skin of his forearms. "Let him go, Toji," he ordered. The doctor relented with a grunt. "There will be plenty of him to smack once Koga gets word of this. The best we can do is try to put this behind us and celebrate as scheduled. It's what Shinji would want."  
健介的指甲深深嵌入前臂的皮肤。"放开他，冬二，" 他命令道。医生咕哝一声，松了手。"一旦古贺得知此事，有的是机会揍他。我们能做的最好的事就是试着把这件事抛诸脑后，按计划庆祝。这是真嗣会希望的。"

"Shinji, Shinji, Shinji," the man interrupted, spitting again as he struggled in vain to get free. "How pathetic all of you are. The captain has the same problem, that's why she's no good. Housing a freak, a dog of war like Ikari's brat. He's nothing but a monster, in the end. And a weakling at th-"  
"真嗣，真嗣，真嗣，" 那人打断道，再次吐唾沫，徒劳地挣扎着想要挣脱。"你们都多可悲啊。队长也有同样的问题，这就是她不行的原因。收留一个怪胎，像碇家那小子一样的战争走狗。他最终不过是个怪物，还是个懦夫，在……"

Both him and Toji flinched at the sound of bone clashing against bone. Two molars flew away and fell on the ground as the man's head rattled and hung. Blood and saliva puddled onto the chair.  
他和冬二听到骨头撞击骨头的声音都不由得一颤。两颗臼齿飞出，落在地上，那人的头猛地一晃，垂了下来。血和唾液在椅子上积成一滩。

Viko's leg retracted without a sound. His hand shot up and grabbed the man's face. "Broken jaw. I'll have to extend my apologies to Koga," he uttered. The temperature of the room turned as icy as his voice. "Don't _ever_ insult Shinji Ikari in my presence."  
维科的腿无声地收回。他的手猛地抬起，抓住那人的脸。“下颌骨断了。我得向古贺道歉，”他低声说道。房间的温度随着他的声音变得冰冷。“别在我面前侮辱碇真嗣。”

The commander shuddered when Viko's thumb pressed on what he assumed was the place where the man's jaw had snapped in two. A wail of agony was silenced by a swift punch to the crew member's gut.  
指挥官在维科的拇指按在他认为是那人下颌断裂处时打了个寒颤。一声痛苦的哀嚎被对船员腹部的迅速一拳所打断。

"Today is my brother's birthday, so I don't have any time to waste it on you," Again, his thumb applied pressure on the fracture. "How many of you are there?"  
"今天是弟弟的生日，我没时间浪费在你身上，" 他的拇指再次施压在骨折处。"你们有多少人？"

Even withering in pain, the man smiled through broken, bloodied teeth. "Enough," he slurred, eyes rolling to the back of his head. "Enough."  
即使痛苦得快要凋零，那人还是带着破碎、血迹斑斑的牙齿笑了。"足够了，"他含糊地说，眼睛翻到后脑勺。"足够了。"

"It's as we feared," Viko announced, and got to his feet. "They've been emboldened, and are growing in numbers. Has the captain been informed?"  
"正如我们所担忧的，" Viko 宣布道，站起身来。"他们变得胆大妄为，数量也在增加。队长已经知道了吗？"

"Of course," Kensuke replied. "If Shinji decides to step onto that ship, things might get complicated."  
"当然，" 真希 replied。"如果真嗣决定登上那艘船，事情可能会变得复杂。"

"Guess the day was bound to come, anyhow." Viko stretched, slapped himself with both hands and produced the easy smile Kensuke was used to seeing. "I've been living on borrowed time all these years. About damn time I stepped up." He turned to face them. "Just take care of my little Brat for me, will you?"  
"反正这一天迟早会来。" Viko 伸了个懒腰，双手拍了拍自己，露出了真希熟悉的轻松笑容。"这些年我一直在借来的时间里生活。是时候站出来了。" 他转向他们。"就帮我照顾好我的小鬼，好吗？"

"You know we will." Toji offered after a few seconds. "What are you planning on doing?"  
"你知道我们会的。" 冬二几秒钟后回答。"你打算做什么？"

"I'll make sure that tree is properly named." Viko responded with a shrug. He smiled. The sun was about to set.  
"我会确保那棵树得到恰当的命名。" Viko 耸了耸肩回应道。他笑了。太阳即将落山。

"You have my word." "我向你保证。"

---

A groan rang loud and clear through the clearing.  
一声呻吟在空地上清晰地响起。

"This is so lame." “这太逊了。”

The massive entourage of about five hundred people laughed in unison. Ryoji growled under his breath and sulked in his high chair. The hat crafted by the women tilted to the side similarly to how Bunzaemon wore his cap out on the fields, which only elicited another choir of mirth.  
大约五百人的庞大队伍齐声大笑。Ryoji 低声咆哮，在高椅上闷闷不乐。女人们制作的帽子歪向一边，就像 Bunzaemon 在田间戴的帽子一样，这又引来了一阵笑声。

Even as he tried to pretend otherwise, Shinji saw the smile slowly make its way to Ryoji's features. Silence descended on the Kaji property. Every attendant took a deep, impatient breath whilst the birthday boy inspected the decorations, the set of tables filled to the brim with food and drink, and the large 'Happy Birthday' sign hanging from two trees.  
尽管他试图假装不在意，Shinji 还是看到微笑慢慢爬上了 Ryoji 的脸庞。Kaji 家的气氛变得沉默。每位侍从都深吸了一口气，显得不耐烦，而寿星则仔细打量着装饰、摆满食物和饮料的桌子，以及挂在两棵树上的巨大“生日快乐”横幅。

"Fine," Ryoji smiled, and laughed to himself as he raised the cup decorated by the village children. "Thank you all for coming! Let's get this going!"  
"好吧，" 莲司微笑着，自顾自地笑了起来，举起了村里孩子们装饰的杯子。"感谢大家光临！让我们开始吧！"

Unbeknownst to him, Ryoji emptied his cup and slammed his hand on he table exactly like Misato would. A loud cheer roared afterwards as the party began. Gallons of liquor fermented from Viko's fruits, lemonade and clear water ran like rivers.  
他并不知情，莲司像美里那样将杯子一饮而尽，然后重重地拍在桌上。随后响起一阵热烈的欢呼声，派对开始了。维科酿制的果酒、柠檬水和清澈的水如同河流般流淌。

"Gosh, look at that bruise!" One of the ladies who worked with Rei swayed, and pointed at his head. "Are you okay, Shinji?"  
"天哪，看那块淤青！" 与丽共事的一位女士摇摇晃晃地指着他的头。"你还好吗，真嗣？"

"It's nothing, really," he repeated for the seventeenth time that evening. "I'm fine, thank you."  
"真的没什么，"那天晚上他第十七次重复道，"我很好，谢谢。"

Dealing with Koga had been horrendous enough. To make matters worse, every few minutes another inebriated village member voiced their concern. It felt strange to belong somewhere, to feel like a part of something. Rei came next, pointed at his bandaged hand and offered a rice cake she had baked in secret. Men whistled, women cooed them together, and he reluctantly ate a piece and complimented it before being mashed together with her by the elders.  
应付犬夜叉已经够糟糕的了。更糟糕的是，每隔几分钟就有一个喝醉的村民表达他们的关心。感觉自己属于某个地方，感觉自己是某个整体的一部分，这种感觉很奇怪。接下来是丽，她指着他包扎的手，递给他一个偷偷烤的米糕。男人们吹口哨，女人们一起发出啧啧声，他勉强吃了一块并称赞了它，然后被长老们和丽紧紧地挤在一起。

"It's… exceptional," he told Rei in a whisper. "Thank you."  
"这……非常出色，"他低声对丽说，"谢谢你。"

She smiled in that carefree, almost curious way of hers. "You are welcome, Shinji."  
她以那种无忧无虑、略带好奇的方式微笑着。“不客气，真嗣。”

Another loud cheer which made him flinch, and soon after music started blaring from the makeshift stage left of the field. Ryoji embraced Kensuke upon receiving the music player, blushed when Rei offered him a similar treat, and grumbled after Viko placed a blindfold on him and led him to the watermelon field he had been growing in secret.  
又一阵响亮的欢呼让他缩了缩身子，紧接着音乐从场地左侧的临时舞台上轰然响起。收到音乐播放器的加持拥抱了真希，当绫波递给他同样的礼物时，他脸红了，而维克托则在给他戴上眼罩并领他到他秘密种植的西瓜地后咕哝了几句。

"Now, I don't know much about your father, but I heard he liked to tend to these." The veil and hat were removed, and for once, Shinji saw Ryoji be completely taken aback. "Happy birthday, little brother."  
“现在，我不太了解你父亲，但我听说他喜欢照料这些。”面纱和帽子被摘下，真嗣第一次看到加持完全愣住了。“生日快乐，小老弟。”

Hikari tiptoed behind Shinji and placed the wrapped clay figure in his arms. "Time for the final touch. We're counting on you."  
光小心翼翼地踮脚走到真嗣身后，将包裹好的陶土人偶放入他怀中。“是时候加上最后一笔了。我们可都指望你了。”

He thought of the pirate roundel. How long ago had the voice changed from 'I mustn't run away' to 'earn'?  
他想起了那个海盗徽章。那声音从“我不能逃跑”变成“赢得”已经过去多久了？

"Here, this is from Rei, Asuka and me," said Shinji. "Whenever we went fishing, they were always there helping us out." _And your mother used to have one as a pet,_ he mused. _His name was Pen-Pen._  
“给，这是绫波、明日香和我一起做的，”真嗣说道，“每次我们去钓鱼，她们总是在旁边帮忙。”他暗自思忖，你的母亲以前也养过一只宠物，它的名字叫 Pen-Pen。

Ryoji laughed and shook his head, eyebrow raised at the beer can held in the penguin's flipper. He held the unveiled gift to the crowd with a shaky smile, and gave Shinji a sturdy hug he was thoroughly unable to return.  
亮司笑了笑，摇摇头，对企鹅鳍上拿着的啤酒罐挑了挑眉。他带着颤抖的微笑，将未包装的礼物展示给众人，并给了真嗣一个结实的拥抱，真嗣完全无法回应。

"You're so lame," he muttered. "All of you, so lame."  
“你真是逊毙了，”他低声抱怨，“你们全都逊毙了。”

Music muted out the whispered words of gratitude from the young Katsuragi, and the feast began. The fermented drinks were the first to be served, followed by generous servings of food, both of which were a rarity. His body moved in automatic while serving meals for everyone, realizing how easy it was to smile to the now familiar faces.  
音乐掩盖了年轻的桂木的低语感谢，盛宴开始了。发酵饮料首先被端上，随后是丰盛的食物，这两样都是稀罕之物。他的身体在为每个人上菜时自动运作，意识到对这些现在熟悉的脸庞微笑是多么容易。

_Courage,_ Shinji whispered to himself over and over. His hand caressed the bandage after he was done helping serve the ocean of hungry attendants. Memories of cooking along with the village members flooded during dinner. They joked and poked fun at him and one another just as they had while preparing he dishes. When he was certain nobody noticed, he added finely sliced portions of each recipe and carefully placed them in a bento.  
勇气，真嗣一遍遍地对自己低语。他帮忙分发完那群饥肠辘辘的宾客后，手轻抚着绷带。晚餐时，与村民们一起烹饪的记忆涌上心头。他们像往常准备菜肴时一样，互相开玩笑、逗乐。确认无人注意后，他悄悄将每道菜的细切部分加入便当盒中。

"Ah, a true feast," Viko sat down next to him at some point in the night, well after the cake had been unveiled and wolfed down. He presented a generous portion of the treat to him. "My brother would be proud."  
“啊，真是盛宴啊，”维克在某晚蛋糕揭幕并被狼吞虎咽后，坐到了他旁边，递给他一大块甜点，“我哥哥会感到骄傲的。”

_Something's missing,_ Shinji mused, and stored away the cake in a large napkin. _It's not like that time at Toji's house. Everyone's smiling. They liked the food. Ryoji liked the cake, and the present. Rei is smiling playing with Tsubame. I'm_ _**actually**_ _enjoying myself, but… something._  
似乎少了点什么，真嗣沉思着，将蛋糕用大餐巾包好。和在东治家那次不同。每个人都在微笑。他们喜欢这些食物。亮司喜欢蛋糕和礼物。绫波在微笑着和燕子玩耍。我确实很享受，但是……总觉得少了些什么。

"Two hours or so till midnight," the man whispered. The package containing the cups was pushed in Shinji's direction. "Koga extends his apologies yet again."  
“大约还有两小时到午夜，”那人低声说道。装着杯子的包裹被推向了真嗣。“古贺再次表示歉意。”

"Please tell him it's okay, and that I'm sorry to have hit his cousin." The package was carefully stored away. His eyes drifted to the sky, the stars. "Would Ryoji get mad if I left?"  
“请告诉他没关系，还有，我为打了他的表弟道歉。”包裹被小心翼翼地收好。他的目光飘向天空，星星。“如果我离开，亮司会生气吗？”

"I think he'd be offended if you didn't." He was pat on the uninjured shoulder twice. Viko gestured towards the trail to the train station. "Say hi to your friend for me."  
“我想如果你不走，他才会不高兴。”他未受伤的肩膀被轻拍了两下。维科示意通往火车站的小径。“替我向你朋友问好。”

Many voiced out their 'displeasure' at his early departure. Shinji was slapped around the back by staggering villagers more times than he could count. At one point a very drunk Toji embraced him and almost hoisted him off the ground, held only by a stone sober and visibly displeased Hikari.  
许多人都对他的提前离开表达了'不满'。真嗣被摇摇晃晃的村民们拍打着后背，次数多得他数不清。有一次，一个醉醺醺的冬二紧紧抱住他，差点把他举离地面，全靠一个清醒且明显不悦的光子支撑着。

Viko's voice and guitar playing muted every other farewell. Shinji realized his singing was incredibly pleasant, and he was gifted in playing the guitar. It made his fingertips itch for the cello strings for the first time in years. The cheers slowly descended to running water, crickets and nocturnal birds.  
维科的声音和吉他演奏盖过了其他所有的告别声。真嗣意识到他的歌声非常悦耳，吉他弹得也很有天赋。这让他多年以来第一次渴望触碰大提琴的弦。欢呼声渐渐变成了潺潺流水、蟋蟀和夜行鸟类的声音。

"Scops owl." The now familiar hoot and scents welcomed him to the house. "Salt water, earth."  
“角鸮。”那熟悉的鸣叫声和气味迎接他回到家中。“咸水，泥土。”

He realized Asuka's absence was the reason he had felt uncomfortable and alone. Surrounded by hundreds of smiling acquaintances, friends and all those who refused to raise judgment on him, he missed the one person who constantly glared at him.  
他意识到，正是明日香的不在，让他感到不舒服和孤单。被数百个微笑的熟人、朋友以及那些不愿对他评头论足的人包围着，他却想念那个总是对他怒目而视的人。

"I guess I'm messed up like that," he told the owl. The bird hooted again, eyes glimmering in the moonlight. "Even if she was playing her videogame all the time, or trying to stay in a corner away from everyone… I would've liked to pester her a little with my dumb rambling."  
“我想我就是这么别扭吧，”他对着猫头鹰说。那只鸟再次发出叫声，月光下眼睛闪闪发亮。“即使她一直在玩她的电子游戏，或是试图躲在角落里远离所有人……我也希望能用我那些愚蠢的唠叨去烦她一下。”

Weariness had begun to set into his bones after dinner. Regardless, Shinji made his way to the forest area.  
晚餐后，疲惫开始渗入他的骨髓。尽管如此，真嗣还是走向了森林区域。

"No rain today," he whispered, carried water from the stream in a small wooden bowl and provided his and the other saplings with a refreshing drink. "Can't have you guys go thirsty."  
“今天没有雨水，”他低语着，从小溪中舀了一小木碗水，给树苗们和自己都带来了一阵清凉。“不能让你们渴着。”

The weeds around the peach tree had been removed, something had been trampled on in its vicinity, as well. No leaves taken by insects. Shinji crouched and gently held one of the larger leaves in between his fingertips. The dream resurfaced. Laying down under a tree, a book in his hand, SDAT in his pocket. Beautiful golden locks swaying with the wind.  
桃树周围的杂草已被清除，附近似乎有什么东西被踩踏过，也没有叶子被虫子啃食。真嗣蹲下身，轻轻用指尖夹住一片较大的叶子。那个梦境再次浮现。他躺在树下，手中拿着一本书，口袋里装着 SDAT。美丽的金色发丝随风摇曳。

Still, uncertainty lingered. Nothing short of heartache and struggle awaited regardless of what he chose.  
然而，不确定性依旧萦绕。无论他选择什么，等待他的都将是心痛与挣扎。

"Enjoy the little moments." Shinji spoke from memory, making his way back to the house. There was something he longed to see again. "Blink and you'll miss them as they pass you by."  
"享受那些小小的瞬间。" 真嗣凭记忆说道，向房子走去。有些东西他渴望再次见到。"眨眼间，它们就会从你身边溜走。"

"I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord…"  
"我能感觉到它今晚在空气中来临，哦，主啊……"

She hummed the piece while her feet dangled off the cot. The novel was boring at best, repetitive and verbose, but had an interesting dark tone that kept her attention. "And I've been waiting for this moment all my life, oh Lord… oh Lord."  
她哼着这段旋律，双脚悬在床边。这本小说顶多算无聊，重复且冗长，但那种引人入胜的黑暗基调让她保持了兴趣。"我一生都在等待这一刻，哦，主啊……哦，主啊。"

_Hmm, I wonder how the princess is doing,_ Mari wondered, and turned to the next page. The song was a cover from a more modern band, one given to her by a starving child bleeding from his hands, chest and back.  
嗯，不知道公主现在怎么样了，玛丽想着，翻到了下一页。这首歌是现代乐队的翻唱，是一个双手、胸口和背部都在流血的饥饿孩子送给她的。

Her thoughts drifted to the Second Child. Their cage felt empty without her constant brooding and sarcastic replies. _Bet she didn't cut her hair, either. I wonder what kinds of meals she's been having. Well, at least she stopped being mean to the Puppy. Step by step, right?_  
她的思绪飘向了第二适格者。没有她不断的忧郁和讽刺的回应，他们的牢笼显得空荡荡的。她肯定也没剪头发。不知道她都在吃什么饭。不过，至少她不再对小狗刻薄了。一步一步来，对吧？

The comm to Mari's side beeped. Reading the encoded message brought up a pang of concern in her sunny mood. Paris had been a success, the Evas were as operational as they were likely to get, and Gendo Ikari had begun the last stage of his scenario.  
玛丽身边的通讯器响了。解读这条加密信息让她的愉快心情涌起了一丝担忧。巴黎的任务成功了，EVA 的运作状态已经达到了预期，而碇源堂也开始了他的最终计划。

_Were you better off shutting away the world with those headphones? I wonder. I wonder if you'll wake up, before the end.  
你戴上耳机隔绝世界，是否真的过得更好？我在想。我在想你是否会在一切结束前醒来。_

In the long years of her unnatural life, nothing had felt so important. Decades of watching 'adults' play around like children, terrified. Whereas the old men fussed over how best to achieve immortality, professor Fuyu's foolish student sought only to see his wife again. Countless days of battling, preparing, all for it to hang in the balance of the coming days.  
在她那非自然的漫长岁月里，没有什么比此刻更显得重要。几十年来，看着那些‘成年人’像孩子一样玩耍，内心充满恐惧。而那些老者们为如何实现永生而焦虑不安，教授冬月的愚蠢学生却只渴望再次见到他的妻子。无数个日夜的战斗与准备，一切都在接下来的日子里悬而未决。

"Too bad Gendo was blind to the Puppy all this time. Blind to his own fear," she intoned, closing the book. "At times I wonder if it was a bad idea to get him and Yui to talk."  
“真可惜，源堂一直没看到那只小狗。连自己的恐惧都视而不见，”她合上书说道，“有时候我在想，让他们俩交谈是不是个错误的决定。”

She jumped off the cot and selected another book. The spot where the dictionary used to be was still empty. It made Mari smile; the message had also mentioned the book's use, and juicy information about the Princess devouring meals, fishing, and even smiling.  
她从床上跳下来，选了另一本书。字典曾经所在的地方依旧空空如也。这让玛丽笑了；信息中也提到了这本书的用途，以及关于公主享用美食、钓鱼甚至微笑的诱人信息。

"Then again, had I _not_ done a little nudging, the Puppy wouldn't exist. And the Princess would be all alone." The desolated wasteland stretched out under her window. "Third Impact was bound to happen, anyway. SEELE would not be stopped, the old men would not be denied. A world covered in red, or a world with nothing but a gigantic yellow soup. Which is the lesser evil, Professor?"  
“再说了，如果不是我稍加推动，小狗就不会存在。而公主将会孤身一人。”荒凉的废土在她窗下延伸。“第三次冲击无论如何都会发生。SEELE 不会被阻止，那些老头不会被拒绝。一个被红色覆盖的世界，或是一个只有巨大黄色汤羹的世界。哪个才是较小的恶，教授？”

Blackened clouds gathered ahead, where life stuck to the Wanderers and all else withered and disappeared in clouds of crimson dust. Blood rain, freezing cold, famine, death. Was it truly possible to rebuild?  
前方乌云密布，生命依附于流浪者，其余的一切在猩红尘埃中枯萎消失。血雨、严寒、饥荒、死亡。真的有可能重建吗？

"Of course it is," Mari replied to her own question. "Little by little, step by step. Suddenly you find yourself doing impossible things."  
"当然是的，"玛丽自问自答道。"一点一点，一步一步。突然间，你会发现自己在做不可能的事。"

An easy smile danced on her lips despite the adversities to come. Who would have thought the unplanned vacation had brought about such wonderful changes in the tide? _Now all we need to do is keep our promise._  
尽管前路充满逆境，她唇边依然跳跃着轻松的微笑。谁会想到这次未经计划的假期竟带来了如此美妙的变化，改变了局势？现在我们只需坚守承诺。

The last part of the message was everything the WUNDER required to achieve some form of victory. Her smile morphed into a confident smirk.  
这条信息的最后一部分，正是 WUNDER 取得某种胜利所需要的一切。她的微笑转变成了自信的冷笑。

"Hope." "希望。"

---

"Stupid. Stupid word. Foolish. Idiotic. Pathetic."  
"愚蠢。愚蠢的词。愚蠢的。白痴的。可悲的。"

An innocent plant was stomped into green mush. Branches laying on the path cracked, rocks were kicked out of the way. Anger flooded her senses, almost blinding her as the image of that brute on top of Shinji had. There was a bitterness as well, one constricting her stomach not unlike the day she had tried to slap Ayanami on the elevator.  
一株无辜的植物被踩成了绿色的泥浆。小路上的树枝断裂，石头被踢到一旁。愤怒充斥着她的感官，几乎让她失明，就像看到那个野蛮人压在真嗣身上时的情景。还有一种苦涩，紧紧束缚着她的胃，就像那天她在电梯里试图扇绫波耳光时的感觉。

"What was I thinking, going there in the first place?" Asuka reprimanded the air, the plants, anything while her hands clenched and pushed into the jacket pockets. The sight of Rei enveloping Shinji in an embrace flashed once more. "Stupid. They can have their party, then."  
"我当初到底是怎么想的，竟然去了那里？" 明日香对着空气、对着植物，对着任何东西训斥着，双手紧握，推入夹克口袋。看到绫波将真嗣拥入怀中的画面再次闪现。"真蠢。他们可以继续他们的派对，随他们去吧。"

_I shouldn't even have bothered to clear the weeds from that stupid tree. I should just squash it. Like it means anything, like any of it matters at all. All this dumb crap, the dumb little kitchen or those pathetic cups. None of it matters. It never did.  
我根本不该费心去清理那棵蠢树周围的杂草。我应该直接把它压扁。就像它有什么意义似的，就像这一切有什么重要似的。所有这些愚蠢的东西，那个愚蠢的小厨房或是那些可悲的杯子。这些都不重要。从来都不重要。_

"God damn it, Ayanami," she hissed, viciously stomping another chamomile plant. "Can't even win against one of your half-assed clones. What do I care, anyway?"  
"该死的，绫波，" 她低声咒骂，狠狠地踩烂了另一株甘菊。"连你一个半吊子的克隆体都赢不了。我到底在乎什么？"

Asuka marched into the house and slammed the door shut, lingering around Shinji's corner. She suppressed the instinct to kick away the SDAT, rip the pages off the dictionary, and retrieve both the jacket and the roundel.  
明日香大步走进屋内，砰地一声关上门，徘徊在真嗣的角落附近。她强压下踢开 SDAT、撕掉字典页的冲动，取回了夹克和圆徽。

"Over a hug? What are you, _twelve_?" Grumbling in distaste, she took a spoonful of water and collapsed on the mattress. "What do _you_ think?" The angel remained quiet, dormant and uncooperative as always. "Curse of Eva, yeah right. How much more pathetic can this existence get?"  
“因为一个拥抱？你几岁啊，十二岁吗？”她不满地咕哝着，舀了一勺水，倒在床垫上。“你怎么看？”天使依旧沉默，一如既往地沉寂且不合作。“《EVA》的诅咒，呵，真是的。这种存在还能再可悲到哪里去？”

She grasped the plush laying beside the pillow and pressed her knuckles against its face. "Idiot."  
她抓住枕头旁的毛绒玩具，用拳头抵住它的脸。“笨蛋。”

_You just had to go, didn't you?_ The Major barked. _What did you expect? Somebody to see you? Welcome you into that place with open arms? You, the ageless freak? Disgusting. Sitting there among them, pretending to be just another Lilin is a foolish hope. I'm a pilot. Anything else is empty, insignificant, and a lie. I'll never be enough for them, for anyone. All I am is the Second Child._  
你非得走这一步，对吧？少校咆哮道。你指望什么？有人看见你？张开双臂欢迎你进入那个地方？你，这个不老的怪物？令人作呕。坐在他们中间，假装只是另一个莉林，那是愚蠢的幻想。我是个驾驶员。其他的一切都是空洞、微不足道且虚假的。我永远不够好，对任何人来说都不够。我只不过是第二适格者。

The ritual of trying to destroy the doll was old and stale, yet she pointlessly stretched the arms and legs while glaring at it. Once or twice already the fabric had torn. Kensuke repaired the damage when she left, saying nothing, and placed the toy back wherever she had thrown it.  
试图摧毁那个玩偶的仪式早已陈旧乏味，但她仍无意义地拉扯着它的四肢，同时瞪着它。布料已经撕裂过一两次。健介在她离开时默默修补了损坏，什么也没说，然后把玩具放回她扔它的地方。

_Never had an actual victory,_ Asuka mused. She relented on her efforts, and held the doll to the ceiling. _Not even worth a second glance if you're not the best, and you were never the best. Just another number on the screen, another failed experiment._  
从未真正胜利过，明日香沉思着。她放弃了努力，将玩偶举到天花板上。如果你不是最好的，甚至不值得多看一眼，而你从来都不是最好的。只是屏幕上的另一个数字，另一个失败的实验品。

"_I'd like to talk to you tonight."_  
"今晚我想和你谈谈。"

"Doesn't matter. His clone wife is about to expire, and then he'll go back to being a broken, feeble brat," the Major concluded. "At least I got to see some backbone for once before it all goes to h-"  
"无所谓。他的克隆妻子快要不行了，之后他又会变回那个破碎、虚弱的毛头小子，"少校总结道，"至少在我看到这一切化为乌有之前，他总算展现了一次骨气——"

"I'm home!" "我回来了！"

Freezing in mid-sentence, Asuka stored away the plush toy under the pillow. _It's not even midnight yet,_ she realized. _Why the hell is the idiot here so early?_  
话说到一半突然停住，明日香将毛绒玩具塞到枕头下。还没到午夜呢，她意识到。那白痴怎么这么早就来了？

"Uh, Asuka?" Shinji's voice rang from the door. "Hello?"  
“呃，明日香？”真嗣的声音从门口传来。“你好？”

"Some home this is," she grumbled back from the room, leaning on the doorframe. "What are you doing here so early? Isn't the party supposed to go till sunrise?"  
“这算什么家啊，”她从房间里抱怨着回应，倚在门框上。“你这么早来干嘛？派对不是应该开到天亮吗？”

"Yeah, but I never meant to stay so long," he replied. Shinji held up the box in his right hand. Time stopped. The cabin melted into an old schoolroom, the tracksuit and plug suit faded, replaced by their uniforms. He smiled in the same way he had that day. "I brought some dinner. Are you hungry?"  
“是啊，但我从未打算停留这么久，”他回答道。真嗣举起右手中的盒子。时间仿佛凝固了。小屋幻化成了一间旧教室，运动服和插入栓服褪去，取而代之的是他们的校服。他以那天同样的笑容看着她。“我带了些晚餐。你饿了吗？”

She was glad for the darkness in the room. He never caught her blush. "I'm starving," Asuka rasped, and pointed to the side of the house that oversaw the ocean. "Took you long enough, you idiot."  
她庆幸房间里的黑暗。他从未察觉到她的脸红。“我饿坏了，”明日香沙哑地说道，并指向房子临海的一侧。“你来得真慢，笨蛋。”

The sound of waves crashing ashore welcomed them outside. The wind carried random echoes of the festivities and soothed her senses. Her heart still hammered in her ears. She stiffly sat next to Shinji, glare glued to the moon, and pretended not to notice how he took time to arrange the boxes.  
海浪拍岸的声音迎接他们来到户外。风带来了节日庆典的零星回响，抚慰着她的感官。她的心跳仍在耳边剧烈跳动。她僵硬地坐在真嗣旁边，目光紧盯着月亮，假装没有注意到他花时间整理盒子。

_There's something in his pocket._ Her eye narrowed, then hastily went back to the blood crosses. _Bruise didn't swell up, neither did the elbow. Seems to be moving the shoulder well enough._  
他口袋里有什么东西。她眯起眼睛，随即匆忙将目光移回血十字上。瘀伤没有肿胀，肘部也没有。肩膀似乎动得还不错。

"You better not have gotten that cut infected." Focusing on the small hug observed from the shadows felt foolish. Rei was still at the party, after all. Asuka huffed. "What's all that crap?"  
“你最好别让那伤口感染了。”专注于从阴影中观察到的微小拥抱显得有些愚蠢。毕竟，丽还在派对上。明日香哼了一声。“那些乱七八糟的是什么？”

"A bit of every dish we prepared," Shinji replied. He offered the bento with a familiar smile. Her pulse doubled. "Well… the ones I thought you'd like, anyway."  
“我们准备的各种菜肴中的一些，”真嗣回答道。他带着熟悉的微笑递上便当。她的心跳加速了一倍。“嗯……至少是我认为你会喜欢的那些。”

"Like you'd know," she almost ripped the bento from his hands, which elicited a chuckle. "Doesn't smell that bad. You made all this?"  
"你懂什么，"她几乎是从他手中夺过便当，这引得他轻笑一声。"闻起来没那么糟。这些都是你做的？"

"I helped," Shinji said. His gaze shifted to the bandage. "I was careful today, too. Changed the bandage before I left."  
"我也帮忙了，"真嗣说。他的目光转向了绷带。"今天我也很小心。出门前换了绷带。"

"Where's yours?" she growled. Her stomach grumbled, mouth salivating. "Hurry it up, let's eat."  
"你的呢？"她咆哮道。肚子咕噜作响，口水直流。"快点，我们开吃吧。"

Shinji produced a smaller bento and a pair of chopsticks. "Sorry."  
真嗣拿出一个小便当和一双筷子。“对不起。”

"Idiot, stop apologizing." Asuka devoured the first three pieces of sushi, shook her head lightly and forced herself to eat slower. "Not bad, this sushi. No sesame on it."  
“笨蛋，别再道歉了。”明日香迅速吃掉了前三块寿司，轻轻摇了摇头，强迫自己吃慢些。“还不错，这寿司。没有放芝麻。”

"Thanks, I'm glad to hear that."  
“谢谢，很高兴听你这么说。”

"Whatever." “随便。”

_He's looking skittish._ There was stew, sushi, ginger chicken and about three more recipes on her dish, all complementing one another and none too overpowering. She tried to focus on the food. _You keep looking over here, then back at your pocket. If you have something to say, just spit it out._  
他看起来有些不安。她的盘子里有炖菜、寿司、姜汁鸡，还有其他三种菜肴，每样都相得益彰，没有哪样过于抢眼。她试图专注于食物。你一直往这边看，然后又看回你的口袋。如果你有什么要说的，就直接说出来吧。

"Uhm, so," as though hearing her thoughts, Shinji cleared his throat. "When's your birthday?"  
“呃，那么，”仿佛听到了她的心声，真嗣清了清嗓子。“你的生日是什么时候？”

_Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt if someone beside Four Eyes knows. I'm gonna be walking to my funeral soon.  
嗯，我想除了四眼仔之外，再有人知道也无妨。我很快就要去参加自己的葬礼了。_

"Don't have one," she stated flatly. "Hmm, chicken's good. Not too spicy, either."  
“没有，”她平淡地说。“嗯，鸡肉不错。也不太辣。”

"You don't have a birthday?" Shinji's tone was not of shock, to her dismay. Sadness lingered in his words. "How's that… how come?"  
“你没有生日吗？”真嗣的语气并没有让她失望的震惊。他的话语中带着一丝悲伤。“怎么会……为什么呢？”

"I wasn't exactly born." Asuka carried on. She tried to muffle out the anger and bitterness, to no avail. "That's why I don't have any parents; I'm basically the result of genetic engineering. Eva is all I was meant to exist for, and since giving me a 'date of creation' was kind of stupid, they didn't."  
"我并非真正意义上的出生。" 明日香继续说道。她试图压抑愤怒和苦涩，却徒劳无功。"这就是为什么我没有父母；我基本上是基因工程的产物。Eva 是我存在的唯一目的，而给我一个‘制造日期’显得有些愚蠢，所以他们没有这么做。"

"All you were meant to exist for?" "Her eyebrows rose as anger began to leak into his words. "Like… Rei?"  
"你存在的唯一目的？" "他的眉毛扬起，愤怒开始在他的话语中渗透。"就像……丽？"

"Somewhat," she stole a glance and found his bento laid to the side, forgotten. Her fork poked at one of his sushi pieces. "We were different, a different style of programming if you will. Socialized in a different way, all that crap."  
"某种程度上，" 她偷瞄了一眼，发现他的便当被搁置一旁，已被遗忘。她的叉子戳了戳他的一块寿司。"我们有所不同，可以说是不同类型的编程吧。以不同的方式社会化，所有那些废话。"

"We?" Fear. It dribbled off that word as he uttered it. "There were… uhm… ho-"  
"我们？" 恐惧如涓涓细流，从他口中吐出这个词时溢出。"有……呃……好——"

"More, yeah." Asuka emptied her bento and took his. The hunger refused to die out. "More like me. But only one was supposed to get the 'honor' of receiving an actual name."  
"更多，是的。" 明日香吃完了自己的便当，接过他的。饥饿感依旧不肯消退。"像我这样的更多。但只有一个能获得'荣幸'，得到一个真正的名字。"

"How did one… get a name, then?"  
"那么，一个人……是如何得到名字的呢？"

_And now you're being careful. Heh Good call, idiot._ "Survival of the fittest, Shinji," Asuka replied in between bites. She took a long drink of the lemonade he had placed beside the bento. "You don't see other Asukas walking around or piloting an Eva, do you?"  
而现在你变得小心翼翼了。呵，明智之举，傻瓜。“适者生存，真嗣，”明日香边吃边回答。她拿起真嗣放在便当旁的那杯柠檬水，喝了一大口。“你看不到其他明日香四处走动或驾驶 Eva，对吧？”

"No, I guess not. I'm… kind of glad it's that way. N-Not to sound insensitive, or anything! I mean I'm glad that… uhm… that I got to meet you, I guess." he was quick to clarify, which earned him a chuckle. "But it sounds like a very lonely life."  
“不，我想没有。我……有点庆幸是这样。不是要显得不敏感，或者别的什么！我是说我庆幸……呃……我猜是庆幸能遇见你。”他急忙补充道，这让他得到了一声轻笑。“但听起来像是一种非常孤独的生活。”

"Lonely," she whispered, poking at the last remnants of the meal. Not even half the effort had been put into preparing his dish. "That's a word for it."  
“孤独，”她低声说，戳着剩下的饭菜。连他那份料理的一半用心都没有。“这个词形容得挺贴切。”

They descended into a comfortable silence, disturbed only by the ocean or the random scream of joy. Despite the cold wind brushing against her jacket, Asuka felt warmth and comfort. A small solace.  
他们陷入了一种舒适的沉默，只被海浪声或偶尔的欢呼声打破。尽管寒风拂过她的夹克，明日香却感到温暖和安慰。小小的慰藉。

_A small victory. Just one, but at least it's yours.  
小小的胜利。仅此一次，但至少是你的。_

"When I was growing up," Shinji said after what felt like hours. "I felt invisible. I really didn't understand why I existed in the first place, why I was alive. I did as my tutor ordered, but never really felt I had any… purpose. I never had any friends. Nobody noticed me. No family parties, birthdays, or anything of the sort. Just…"  
“当我长大的时候，”真嗣在仿佛数小时后说道，“我感觉自己像个隐形人。我真不明白我为什么存在，为什么活着。我按照家教的吩咐去做，但从未真正感觉到我有任何……目的。我从未有过朋友。没有人注意到我。没有家庭聚会，没有生日，或任何类似的事情。只是……”

"Surviving until the next morning," she added. Shinji nodded beside her. "Only to do it all over again."  
"撑到明天早上，"她补充道。真嗣在她旁边点了点头。"然后一切又从头再来。"

"After my father told me to come to Tokyo, I thought finally _something_ would change," he said. "Maybe I'd understand why my father abandoned me right after my mother died. Maybe I'd get answers, or maybe someone would notice I was there at all."  
"父亲让我来东京时，我以为终于会有所改变，"他说。"也许我能明白为什么母亲去世后父亲就抛弃了我。也许我能得到答案，或者至少有人会注意到我的存在。"

Her features relaxed, forcing the mask of anger away. _Lonely. Empty. Cold. Yeah, I know a little about that. Apparently do you as well, huh, idiot?_  
她的表情放松了，强迫自己摘下愤怒的面具。孤独。空虚。冰冷。是啊，我对此略知一二。看来你也一样，对吧，傻瓜？

"Misato certainly noticed," Asuka mentioned. "So did her alcoholic bird. Speaking of which, did the Katsuragi spawn like that dumb figurine?"  
“美里肯定注意到了，”明日香提道，“她的酒鬼企鹅也是。说到这个，葛城家的那小家伙喜欢那个傻乎乎的玩偶吗？”

The sound of his laughter was foreign. She had seldom heard it, if at all. Most of the times Shinji laughed, he was away joking with Ryoji or speaking with Rei. It was soft, and unnaturally soothing.  
他的笑声听起来很陌生。她很少听到，如果有的话。大多数时候，真嗣笑的时候，他都是和良治开玩笑或者和绫波说话。那笑声轻柔，且异常抚慰人心。

"He was trying really hard not to cry at one point," Shinji said in between chuckles. "He failed miserably. Called Pen-Pen lame. But… I think he was really happy."  
“他一度努力忍住不哭，”真嗣在笑声中说道，“结果失败得很惨。说 Pen-Pen 逊毙了。但……我觉得他其实很开心。”

"I thought about what you said about him being lucky," her voice quieted to an extent. "From a certain perspective, you're not totally wrong, Idiot."  
"我考虑了你说的关于他很幸运的话，"她的声音低沉了一些。"从某种角度看，你也不完全错，笨蛋。"

_Really expected something other than this after telling you where I came from,_ Asuka thought. Her body felt light, light and lazy. _What did I expect? More shock, for one. Disgust, maybe. Pity. I can't put into words how much it pisses me off that you gave me none of these things._  
真的以为在你知道我的来历后会有别的反应，明日香心想。她的身体感觉轻盈，轻盈而慵懒。我期待什么？更多的震惊，或许是。厌恶，可能。怜悯。你没给我这些，我无法形容这让我有多恼火。

"Getting to know him was sort of a blessing," revealed Shinji. "Well, getting to know everyone. I'm really grateful to you for that."  
"认识他算是一种福气，"真嗣透露道。"嗯，认识每一个人。我真的很感激你让我有这个机会。"

"What the hell do I have to do with you playing around in the village?" She snapped more out of instinct, and was irked by the way the biting comment didn't faze him. "Last I checked it was Kensuke who took you there."  
"我跟你在这村子里瞎闹有什么关系？" 她本能地厉声说道，对于这尖锐的评论对他毫无影响感到恼火。"我记得是 Kensuke 带你去的。"

"You made sure the fever didn't kill me," he replied with a shy smile. His hand massaged the wrist she had injured. "You cleaned this wound. Brought me here, made sure I didn't starve myself. You… gave me the dictionary, batteries for my SDAT, the cap. The roundel."  
"你确保了发烧没要了我的命，" 他带着羞涩的微笑回答。他的手按摩着她受伤的手腕。"你清理了这个伤口。带我到这里，确保我没有饿着自己。你……给了我字典，SDAT 的电池，那顶帽子。那个徽章。"

"Had to find some way to keep my prisoner alive," Asuka snickered. She shook her head and punched Shinji's healthy shoulder with no strength behind it. "You were being a brat, and it was annoying as hell."  
"得想办法让我的囚犯活下来，" Asuka 嗤笑道。她摇了摇头，毫无力气地捶打了一下 Shinji 健康的肩膀。"你当时真是个小鬼，烦死人了。"

"Sorry." “对不起。”

"Ugh. Whatever. And don't thank me again."  
"哼，随你怎么说。还有，别再谢我了。"

"T-I…" He stumbled for words, which broadened her smirk. It was nice to catch him off guard. "Uhm, understood."  
"我……" 他结巴着找词，这让她得意地笑了。能让他措手不及，感觉真好。"呃，明白了。"

_Don't thank me when I can see that mark on your wrist, Shinji,_ her mind whispered. _Not when I can still remember you choking on the rations I stuffed down your throat. Don't pretend I wasn't trying to hurt you, as well._  
当我看到你手腕上的痕迹时，真嗣，我的心里在低语，不要感谢我。不要忘记你曾因我强行塞给你的食物而窒息。不要假装我那时不是在伤害你。

The clock Kensuke had set by the table beeped. Another day scratched away from her impending doom. _This is boring,_ she realized. Neither was speaking much, poking for more details, or recoiling at the information received. _It's tremendously boring. I could get used to this._  
健介放在桌上的闹钟响了。又一天从她迫近的厄运中被划去。她意识到，这很无聊。两人都不怎么说话，只是试探着更多的细节，或是对收到的信息感到退缩。极其无聊。我可能会习惯这种状态。

Asuka heard him fumble with the jacket soon after. Nervousness began to come off him in waves, she saw him drop whatever he'd been hiding in his pocket twice. Shinji cleared out his throat again, and stared at anything but her.  
明日香听到他不久后摸索着外套的声音。紧张感如潮水般从他身上涌出，她看到他把口袋里藏的东西掉了两次。真嗣再次清了清喉咙，目光四处游移，就是不看她。

"So, it's past midnight," Shinji started, hesitant. "I've… never even had a birthday, myself. The cap was the first birthday present I ever got. And if you like, since you don't have one of your own," he pushed a finely decorated wooden box towards her. "Maybe you can have today. I-I'd remember it."  
“那么，已经过了午夜，”真嗣开口，语气犹豫。“我自己……从未有过生日。这顶帽子是我收到的第一份生日礼物。如果你愿意，既然你自己没有，”他将一个装饰精美的木盒推向她。“也许你可以拥有今天。我……我会记住它的。”

"What nonsense are you talking about now?" Asuka demanded while inspecting the box. It was crafted from what smelled like oak, irregular and not quite efficient when closing without the metal lid. Inside, two ceramic cups rested. "Are these supposed to be sake cups or something?"  
"你又在胡说八道些什么？" 明日香一边检查着盒子一边质问道。这盒子似乎是用橡木做的，形状不规则，没有金属盖子的话关起来不太严实。里面放着两个陶瓷杯子。"这些是用来喝清酒的吗？"

"Yeah." she heard him bite down on his own jaw to cease the stuttering. "I… don't have any on me, though. We're still underage."  
"嗯。" 她听到他咬紧牙关，止住了结巴。"我……虽然身上没有带。我们还没到法定年龄。"

"We? Pfft, yeah right." Scoffing at the strange reply, she lifted each and analyzed them under the moonlight. One was painted blue, white and red, and the other was a depiction of her pirate insignia, albeit with one small difference. "Where's the eyepatch?"  
"我们？哼，得了吧。" 她对这奇怪的回答嗤之以鼻，拿起每个杯子在月光下仔细观察。一个杯子绘有蓝、白、红三色，另一个则是她的海盗徽章图案，但有一点小小的不同。"眼罩去哪儿了？"

Shinji almost dropped whatever plate he was preparing behind her, yet refused to answer.  
真嗣差点把她身后的盘子摔了，却拒绝回答。

She rolled her eye. "Fine, not like it matters. So, what am I supposed to do with these if I'm _underage_, as you say, Idiot?"  
她翻了个白眼。"好吧，反正也不重要。那么，既然你说我是未成年，白痴，我该怎么处理这些东西？"

"I thought it could be like a promise," he replied. Her pulse quickened yet again. "A promise that I'll… see my punishment through, whatever it is. And that we'll drink from these in a few years. M-Maybe to name the tree, you know?"  
"我以为这可以像一个承诺，"他回答道。她的心跳再次加速。"一个承诺，我会……接受我的惩罚，无论是什么。然后几年后，我们会用这些酒来庆祝。也许是为了给那棵树命名，你知道吗？"

"Heh." Asuka smiled, and since he seemed so fond of them, she offered it to him. Even under the dim light it was easy to see his face flush. "A promise. What a stupid thing to give to somebody," she said. "Fine, then. You better pull off something better than two tiny cups for next year." 

"N-Next year?" 

"Isn't that the point of a birthday?" 

"Right! I'll… do some research on more recipes," he offered between stutters. His uncertainty was not unpleasant, for once. Instead, she found it endearing. "How about a part-"  
"好！我……去找些新食谱研究，"他结结巴巴地提议道。他的不确定这次并不令人反感，反而让她觉得可爱。"要不我们分……"

"No way in hell. Think of something better."  
"绝对不行。想个更好的主意。"

"I will! I'll try my best."  
"我会！我会尽力的。"

And she believed him. Her back relaxed against the wood. "Will you, now?"  
她相信了他。她的背部放松地靠在木板上。“你现在愿意了？”

They talked through the night, just as he had requested they do. Asuka glared at the cake as though it had insulted her, and he beamed as she ate and demanded half of his portion. All too soon the sky began to clear.  
他们彻夜长谈，正如他所请求的那样。明日香瞪着蛋糕，仿佛它侮辱了她，而他则在她吃着并要求分他一半时露出了笑容。天空很快就开始放晴了。

Despite his efforts to remain awake, the curse had not entirely set in Shinji's body. His head lolled on her shoulder after the sun rose. He was about to fall over and smack his skull against the floor when she carefully guided his head to her lap.  
尽管他努力保持清醒，但诅咒并未完全侵入真嗣的身体。太阳升起后，他的头靠在了她的肩上。就在他快要倒下，脑袋即将撞到地板时，她小心翼翼地将他的头引向自己的大腿。

"Consider this payment for the gift, and nothing else," Asuka muttered into the morning of her very first birthday. "Idiot."  
“就当是礼物的一点回礼，别的什么也不是，”明日香在她第一个生日清晨喃喃自语，“白痴。”

**To Be Continued**… 未完待续……

### Chapter 8 Misty Morning
Gulls and terns sang their hunger into the sky.  
海鸥和燕鸥将它们的饥饿唱入天空。

Salt, wet soil and LCL welcomed him back to consciousness. Another scent, something familiar and comforting filtered through, and instantly Shinji's eyes opened. The military jacket Asuka wore slid off his shoulders, forcing a shiver as the ocean breeze filtered through.  
盐、湿润的泥土和 LCL 的气息将他唤醒。另一种熟悉而令人安心的气味渗透进来，瞬间让真嗣睁开了眼睛。明日香穿着的军装夹克从他肩上滑落，海风穿透而过，让他不由打了个寒颤。

"Damn it," he grumbled. Asuka was nowhere in sight, yet her scent continued to envelop him. "You fell asleep after your one chance. Stupid curse, what good is it if it can't keep me awake for one freaking night?"  
“该死，”他咕哝着。明日香不见踪影，但她的气息依旧环绕着他。“你只试了一次就睡着了。愚蠢的诅咒，如果连一个晚上都让我保持清醒都做不到，那有什么用？”

The red jacket rested where he assumed his head had been. _Something… on my hair,_ he thought, still half-asleep. _I don't remember dozing off. I don't remember bringing that jacket out here. And this;_ his fingers clutched the green fabric with vehemence. _The last thing I remember was telling Asuka I wanted to try baking something again, and then…_  
那件红色夹克躺在他认为自己的头曾经所在的地方。有什么东西……在我的头发上，他想，仍然半睡半醒。我不记得打瞌睡了。我不记得把那件夹克带到这里。还有这个；他的手指紧紧抓住绿色布料。我最后记得的是告诉明日香我想再尝试做点烘焙，然后……

A yawn made its way out of his chest, and as Shinji's hand traced down his hairline, a memory resurfaced. Soft, warm hands delicately massaging his scalp, scratching on occasion and drawing lazy circles through his hair.  
一个哈欠从他胸腔中逸出，随着真嗣的手沿着发际线滑下，一段记忆浮现出来。柔软温暖的手轻柔地按摩着他的头皮，偶尔轻挠，又在他的发间懒洋洋地画着圈。

"Was that a dream?" he wondered out loud. "If it was, why did it have to end?"  
“那是一场梦吗？”他自言自语道，“如果是梦，为何非要结束不可？”

The sensation washed over with the second gush of wind, as though it had happened minutes before he awoke. A tiny smile brightened his weary features. Judging by the temperature and the sun's position in the sky, it was close to noon. How long had it been since he had last slept so soundly?  
第二阵风袭来，那种感觉如潮水般涌来，仿佛就在他醒来前的几分钟发生过。一丝微笑点亮了他疲惫的面容。根据气温和太阳在天空中的位置判断，时间已近正午。他已经有多久没有如此酣睡过了？

"Well, there's that fourteen-year long nap," Shinji reprimanded himself and carefully folded the military coat. "Now the early hours are gone and there's still so much to do-"  
“唉，那十四年的长眠，” 真嗣自责地想着，小心翼翼地叠好军装外套。“现在清晨的时光已逝，还有那么多事情要做——”

"Ugh, give it a rest," Asuka's voice snapped from behind. Shinji's jaw hinged closed. "The entire adult population of this place is nursing a terrible hangover, Kensuke included." She walked over and retrieved the coat from the ground. "Have a freaking day off, you idiot."  
“呃，别再念叨了，” 明日香的声音从背后突然响起。真嗣的下巴猛地合上。“这个地方的所有成年人，包括健介，都在忍受着宿醉的折磨。”她走过来从地上捡起外套。“给自己放一天假吧，你这个笨蛋。”

_I don't deserve a day off. I haven't earned it._ The smile died with a single glance at the crimson extending far beyond the ocean. _If yesterday proves anything, is how little I've accomplished. I have to try harder._  
我不配放假。我还没挣到。只需一眼望向那片远超海洋的深红，笑容便瞬间消逝。如果说昨天证明了什么，那就是我成就的微不足道。我必须更加努力。

Asuka's hand slapped the top of his head, fingers pressing hard into his scalp. "I said have a day off," she repeated with a commanding tone. Shinji gulped. "Did I stutter? If you're so hell-bent on doing something, go make some food. I'm starving."  
明日香的手掌拍在他的头顶，手指紧紧压入他的头皮。“我说了让你休息一天，”她用命令的语气重复道。真嗣咽了口唾沫。“我说得不清楚吗？如果你这么执意要做点什么，去弄点吃的。我快饿死了。”

"You are?" he asked in awe. Excitement instantly bubbled and spread to Shinji's limbs. He was on his feet in seconds, and almost darted to the greenery. "Just a second!"  
“你确定？”他带着敬畏问道。兴奋感立刻涌动，蔓延至真嗣的四肢。他几秒钟内就站了起来，几乎要冲向那片绿意。“稍等一下！”

The rush of preparing a proper breakfast deprived him of Asuka's half-smirk and derisive chuckle. However, once the wood kitchen was set ablaze and eggs sizzled in his pan, she sat by the table and spared him the occasional glance. Instead of anger, he sensed curiosity clouding her sharp gaze, almost as if she was expecting him to act or speak to her differently.  
准备一顿像样的早餐的忙碌让他无暇顾及明日香的半笑和嘲讽的轻笑。然而，当木制厨房被点燃，鸡蛋在他的平底锅中滋滋作响时，她坐在桌旁，偶尔瞥他一眼。他感受到的不是愤怒，而是好奇笼罩着她锐利的目光，仿佛她期待着他以不同的方式行动或与她交谈。

_Oh,_ Shinji realized just before the meal started to burn. _She probably never talks about her past. Maybe she expected something else? It doesn't make any difference at all. Asuka is Asuka._  
哦，真嗣在饭菜开始烧焦前才意识到。她大概从不谈论自己的过去。也许她期待着别的什么？但这根本无关紧要。明日香就是明日香。

"Nothing, huh," she rasped, as though reading his mind. "You puked after seeing me naked, but have no reaction to me being some ageless clone bred for war."  
“没什么，是吧，”她沙哑地说道，仿佛看穿了他的心思。“你看到我裸体后吐了，但对我是个为战争而培育的不老克隆体却毫无反应。”

Desperately crushing the urge to ask if it had been her hands on his head the night before, Shinji tried to smile. He placed a healthy portion of eggs, bread and rice beside her. A knuckle brushed Asuka's arm, and no punch, snarl, or glare came his way.  
真嗣拼命压抑着询问前一晚是否是她双手按在他头上的冲动，努力挤出一个微笑。他在她旁边放了一大份鸡蛋、面包和米饭。一个指节轻轻擦过明日香的手臂，而她既没有挥拳，也没有咆哮或瞪眼。

"Sorry," uttered Shinji on instinct, and pointed to his neck. "It was the collar."  
“抱歉。” 真嗣本能地脱口而出，指了指自己的脖子。“是那个项圈。”

"Was it? I never imagined," she replied with a roll of her eye. "Retching was sort of what I expected, though."  
“是吗？我倒是没想到。”她翻了个白眼回答道，“不过，呕吐倒是意料之中的反应。”

_She expected me to vomit after hearing about her past?_ The comment stung like Ramiel's blast, and shone a completely new light on Asuka. All the sudden, it was clear as day to him. _She looks so alone._  
她以为我会听完她的过去后呕吐吗？这话如雷米尔的冲击般刺痛了他，也让明日香在他眼中的形象彻底改变。突然间，一切都变得清晰明了。她看起来如此孤独。

"I guess without your life being the way it was, you wouldn't be the person I met," he said, enunciating each word carefully. "I'm sorry you had to go through such a life, but it's part of who you are, Asuka."  
“我想，如果不是你的生活那样，你就不会是我遇到的那个人，”他小心翼翼地说，每个字都发音清晰。“我很遗憾你经历了那样的人生，但那是你的一部分，明日香。”

A scowl obscured the girl's features after trying the meal. "You say it like it's a good thing, who I am. What I am."  
女孩尝了一口饭菜后，皱起了眉头。“你把它说得好像是件好事，我是谁。我是什么。”

_But I like who you are._ The thought made Shinji's face brighten once more, as memories from the day before resurfaced. For someone so strong and ruthless, Asuka had shown she also had the capacity to be indescribably tender. _A lot._  
但我喜欢你这样的人。这个念头让真嗣的脸再次亮了起来，昨天的记忆又浮现在脑海中。对于一个如此坚强和无情的人来说，明日香也展现出了她难以形容的温柔。很多。

"Without you being who you are, I'd probably not be here, right now," Shinji replied. The scar on his wrist came into view, so he ran his thumb across it. "You've been fighting for so long. Who knows how many times you've saved everyone, already."  
“如果不是你成为现在的你，我可能不会在这里，对吧？”真嗣回答道。他手腕上的伤疤映入眼帘，于是他用拇指轻轻抚过。“你已经战斗了这么久。谁知道你已经拯救了大家多少次。”

"Not like there's a whole lot to save," Asuka rebutted, albeit without any anger or spite. She was not blaming him for anything, merely pointing out the sorry state of the world. "It's what I was made for. Never really had much of a choice."  
“不像有什么值得拯救的，”明日香反驳道，尽管没有愤怒或怨恨。她并没有责怪他什么，只是指出了这个世界的糟糕状况。“这是我被创造出来的目的。从来就没有太多选择。”

_She's still sharing details about her life with me_. Joy continued to dance in his chest, and many times he fought to not smile like a fool. _Telling me about her. Its like I'm still dreaming._  
她还在向我分享她的生活细节。喜悦继续在他的胸中跳动，许多次他努力不让自己像个傻瓜一样笑出来。告诉我关于她的事。就像我还在做梦一样。

"You had the choice to let me die, and nobody would've minded," Shinji whispered, eyes downcast. He gripped at his wrist, recalling the many times Asuka had seen to the wound. "But you didn't. You're the first person who's ever-" he hesitated, thinking of Misato and Kaworu. "-cared."  
"你本可以选择让我死去，没有人会在意的，" 真嗣低声说道，目光低垂。他紧握着手腕，回想起无数次明日香为他处理伤口的情景。"但你没有。你是第一个——" 他犹豫了一下，想起了美里和薰。"——关心我的人。"

"Shut up." Asuka snapped, and he instantly ducked his head lower. Shinji failed to catch the strain in her voice, but caught a glance of her looking away with a slight pink coloring on her cheeks. "Stop spewing nonsense."  
"闭嘴。" 明日香厉声说道，他立刻低下了头。真嗣没能察觉到她声音中的紧张，但瞥见她转过头去，脸颊微微泛红。"别再说这些胡话了。"

"Can I offer a definition, instead, then?" he asked. Asuka raised a curious eyebrow. "It's a word I found yesterday."  
"那么，我可以提供一个定义吗？" 他问道。明日香好奇地挑了挑眉。"这是我昨天找到的一个词。"

"You and your dumb little words," was her nonchalant reply. "Go on, then."  
"你和你那些愚蠢的小词儿，"她漫不经心地回答，"继续吧，然后呢。"

_Help. Build. Earn. Make her smile._ "Steadfast," Shinji stated. "Resolutely or dutifully firm and unwavering."  
帮助。建设。赚取。让她微笑。 "坚定不移，" 真嗣说道。 "坚决或尽责地坚定不移。"

The hairs on his nape stood to no end when no immediate reaction came. All it would take was one wrong step for the glass between them to reappear. Relief flooded his senses once a grunt echoed through the room.  
当没有立即反应时，他颈后的毛发竖立不止。只需一步走错，他们之间的玻璃就会重新出现。当一声闷哼在房间里回荡时，他的感官被解脱感淹没。

"Heh." Asuka shook her head and concealed her eye under the hoodie. However, he caught the slight curvature of her lips. "What do you know, anyway?"  
"哼。" 明日香摇了摇头，将眼睛藏在连帽衫下。然而，他捕捉到了她嘴角微微的弧度。"你又懂什么？"

_Not nearly enough, and not as much as I'd like to,_ he mused while fiddling with breakfast. The hidden message between her words filtered through. _She didn't hate the word._  
他一边摆弄着早餐，一边沉思，觉得自己了解得还不够多，也不如自己所希望的那样多。她话语中隐藏的信息渗透进来。她并不讨厌这个词。

They ate in what became a comfortable silence afterwards, daring the occasional glance that ended with both darting their gazes away. Time and time again, the phantom touch from the dream returned. Asuka's voice, softer with each passing hour as she devoured the cake, easing the uncertainty and guilt.  
之后，他们在一阵舒适的沉默中用餐，偶尔鼓起勇气互瞥一眼，然后又迅速移开视线。一次又一次，梦中那虚幻的触感再次浮现。随着时间的推移，明日香的声音越来越柔和，她大口吃着蛋糕，缓解了不确定感和内疚感。

Shinji's hand went to his hair and started playing with the overgrown locks. He never realized it, nor did he catch Asuka's eye going wide with surprise, or her face heating up.  
真嗣的手不自觉地伸向头发，开始摆弄那些过长的发丝。他并未意识到这一点，也没有注意到明日香惊讶地睁大了眼睛，或是她脸上泛起的红晕。

"Ugh," Kensuke groaned from the floor. The man dragged himself along on all fours and collapsed on the table's surface. "Never again."  
“呃，”剑介从地板上发出呻吟。他四肢并用，艰难地爬行，最后瘫倒在桌面上。“再也不喝了。”

"That's what you get for drinking that poison," Asuka provided with a smirk. "Hey, Idiot. Watch this."  
“谁让你喝那毒药，”明日香带着一丝嘲笑说道，“嘿，笨蛋。看好了。”

A loud clap rang across the room. Kensuke withered in agony and covered his ears. However, he recovered miraculously fast once the plate full of greasy breakfast was placed before him.  
一声巨响在房间内回荡。剑介痛苦地缩成一团，捂住了耳朵。然而，当一盘油腻的早餐摆在他面前时，他奇迹般地迅速恢复了过来。

"If there's a God, may he bless you forever," he told Shinji with a dreamy gaze, then dug into the food. "Oh, _yes_."  
“如果有上帝，愿他永远保佑你，”他梦幻般地凝视着真嗣说道，随即开始大快朵颐。“哦，没错。”

_Deja-vu,_ Shinji thought, and began to wash the dishes. _Reminds me of those few mornings in Misato's house._ Hikari's own explanation of a certain word resurfaced. _Home; the place where we feel most comfortable, loved, and protected._  
似曾相识的感觉，真嗣心想，并开始洗碗。让我想起了在美里家的那些早晨。光对某个词的解释再次浮现。家；我们感到最舒适、被爱和保护的地方。

"Make sure not to puke that out, limited resources and all that." Asuka snapped. She walked over to where her jacket lay, then pointed at the door. "It's past midday," she told Shinji. "I don't feel like spending the day in a house that smells of vomit and cheap wine."  
"别吐出来，资源有限嘛。" 明日香厉声说道。她走到自己的夹克旁，然后指向门口。"已经过了中午了，" 她对真嗣说。"我不想整天待在一间充满呕吐物和廉价葡萄酒气味的房子里。"

_She wants to go out? Really?_ Panic and uncertainty slammed against Shinji's consciousness. After a few deep, even breaths, he realized this was yet another chance. "There's a new row of saplings Ryoji wanted to plant next to the watermelon field," he offered. "I can make us a light lunch to go. It'll be a few minutes, though."  
她想出去？真的吗？恐慌和不确定感冲击着真嗣的意识。经过几次深呼吸，他意识到这又是一个机会。"那边有新的一排树苗，是良治想种在西瓜田旁边的，" 他提议道。"我可以给我们准备一份便当。不过需要几分钟。"

"I'm not getting my hands muddy, idiot." Instead of reaching for the handheld, Asuka crossed her arms and leaned on the doorframe. "Get on with it, then."  
"我才不要把手弄脏，笨蛋。" 明日香没有去拿手持设备，而是交叉双臂靠在门框上。"那就快点吧。"

Once more, the true meaning of her words sunk in without difficulty. Being outside in the presence of other villagers made her uncomfortable, and yet she was willing to endure it, if only once.  
她的言外之意再次毫不费力地深入心底。身处村中众人之间让她感到不适，但即便如此，她仍愿意忍受，哪怕只有一次。

_Earn, Shinji. Work. Build. Struggle. Grow. Make Asuka smile.  
努力吧，真嗣。工作。建设。奋斗。成长。让明日香微笑。_

His hands steadied whilst preparing the bentos, his mind clear and somewhat sharp. The breeze made Asuka's hair dance and shine under the sunlight.  
他准备便当时双手变得稳定，思绪清晰且敏锐。微风让明日香的头发在阳光下舞动，闪耀着光芒。

"Conviction," Shinji whispered. "A firmly held belief or opinion."  
"信念," 真嗣低声说道。"一种坚定持有的信仰或观点。"

---

"Hmm, it's cute how she glowers at Rei, right?"  
"嗯，她对零怒目而视的样子真可爱，对吧？"

Ryoji snickered at Hikari's remark, which only solidified her stance on the unique interaction taking place before them. It had taken the younger Kaji no less than five minutes to forsake his responsibility to Rei and Shinji. The surprise had been seeing Major Shikinami sit in the shade and throw the occasional glare at the duo.  
听到光的话，凉宫嗤笑了一声，这更坚定了她对眼前独特互动的看法。年轻的加持不到五分钟就放弃了照顾真嗣和零的责任。令人惊讶的是，看到式波少校坐在阴凉处，偶尔向那对情侣投去一瞥。

"She gave me an earful when Shinji started helping," Ryoji added. "You'd think at this point they'd just be honest with each other, right?" He pointed to the barrier. "I mean, what's there to lose? It's like Viko says. Life is so fleeting, you should never waste time on lies."  
"她对我在真嗣开始帮忙时大发雷霆，" 莲司补充道。"你以为到了这个地步，他们应该坦诚相待，对吧？" 他指向屏障。"我是说，还有什么可失去的呢？就像维科说的。生命如此短暂，你永远不应该在谎言上浪费时间。"

"They _are_ being honest, in their own way," schooled Hikari with a slight frown. _Boys, always so blind._ "Some people just need more time to build bridges of communication. Imagine how hard it was for her."  
"他们以自己的方式在坦诚，" 光子微微皱眉地教导道。男孩们，总是那么盲目。"有些人只是需要更多时间来建立沟通的桥梁。想象一下这对她来说有多难。"

A shrug was thrown her way, and a scowl darkened Ryoji's features. "Yeah, right. She treated him like crap for a while."  
她得到了一个耸肩，而莲司的表情变得阴沉。"是啊，没错。她有一阵子对他很糟糕。"

"She does that with everyone," Hikari countered with ease. "In her own way, she's taken care of him more than any of us."  
"她对每个人都这样，"光轻松地反驳道，"以她自己的方式，她对他的照顾比我们任何人都多。"

"Bet it must feel weird for her, too, being the talk of the town." Ryoji stretched and brushed the dust off his pants. "Everyone's rooting for them."  
"对她来说一定也很奇怪，成为镇上的话题人物。" 良树伸了个懒腰，拍掉裤子上的灰尘，"大家都支持他们。"

Rei tripped over some of the overgrown weeds just as Ryoji returned to the field. Even from afar, it was easy to spot Asuka turning her head away in a huff when Shinji offered his hand and helped the young clone to her feet. _Jealous much, Asuka? Heh, maybe I'll get a chance to tease you at last, after all these years._  
丽绊倒在茂盛的杂草中，正好良树回到田里。即使从远处看，也很容易注意到当真嗣伸出手帮助年轻的克隆人站起来时，明日香气呼呼地转过头去。吃醋了吗，明日香？嘿，也许经过这么多年，我终于有机会取笑你了。

The sun was setting under their tranquil day. Silence stretched over the village and Shinji smiled often, sometimes without realizing it. Asuka's posture relaxed with every passing hour. Even at a sizable distance, they set each other at ease.  
夕阳在他们宁静的一天中缓缓下沉。村子被寂静笼罩，真嗣时常微笑，有时甚至未曾察觉。随着时间的流逝，明日香的身体也逐渐放松。即使相隔甚远，他们也能让彼此感到安心。

"All those nights you were looking up there, at the sky," Hikari whispered. Her motherly gaze softened once Asuka marched towards the teens, and pushed a bottle of cold lemonade in Shinji's hands. "You held onto those few moments for so long. I'm glad you finally have a chance to make new ones."  
“那些夜晚你总是仰望星空，” 美里轻声说道。当明日香走向少年们，将一瓶冰镇柠檬水塞到真嗣手中时，她那母性的目光变得柔和。“你一直紧紧抓住那些短暂的瞬间。我很高兴你终于有机会创造新的回忆了。”

Over in the field, Asuka dug the shovel into the dry earth a few times. She half stuck one of the seedlings in the hole, then made no effort to cover it with fresh dirt or fertilizer, so Shinji crouched and finished the work. The way Asuka positioned herself strategically between Shinji and Rei was almost too telling.  
在田野那边，明日香几次用铲子挖进干燥的泥土。她将一株幼苗半插进洞里，却没有费心去覆盖新土或施肥，于是真嗣蹲下身来完成了这项工作。明日香巧妙地站在真嗣和丽之间，这位置的选择几乎过于明显了。

_Step by step, little by little,_ she mused under the shade. _Suddenly you find yourself doing impossible things. Isn't that right, Shinji?_  
一步一步，一点一滴，她在树荫下沉思。突然间，你会发现自己在做不可能的事。不是吗，真嗣？

Asuka offered her hand and hoisted Shinji to his feet once the last seedling was watered. Somehow, Hikari felt at ease, as though their broken world had a fighting chance at long last.  
当最后一株幼苗浇完水后，明日香伸出手将真嗣拉了起来。不知为何，Hikari 感到心安，仿佛他们破碎的世界终于有了抗争的机会。

_Isn't that right, Asuka?  不是吗，明日香？_

---

"Wrong. Sesame seeds are salty. I don't see the point to them."  
"错了。芝麻是咸的。我看不出它们有什么用。"

"Just because you don't like them doesn't mean the world shares your opinion."  
"你不喜欢不代表全世界都这么想。"

"Then, the world is wrong. What do you know about anything, you purple haired brat?"  
"那这个世界就错了。你个紫毛小鬼，懂什么？"

"I know about botany! And about music, and literature, and art. I know about mechanics, electronics, I'm learning a second language, and-  
"我对植物学有所了解！还有音乐、文学、艺术。我懂机械学、电子学，还在学习第二语言，以及——"

"Yeah, yeah. Hey, idiot. This isn't so bad."  
"是啊，是啊。嘿，傻瓜。这也没那么糟。"

"Thank you, Asuka! How does yours taste, Rei?"  
"谢谢你，明日香！你的味道如何，绫波？"

"Delightful." "令人愉悦。"

"I'm glad you like it."  
"很高兴你喜欢。"

"Needs some seasoning, this one."  
"这得加点料，这个。"

Ryoji resisted the urge to either burst out laughing or intervene to poke fun at the trio. Shikinami showing up had come as no surprise; she trailed Shinji's footsteps like a bloodhound on most days. His jaw had almost slacked open after she picked a shovel that day, nonetheless.  
Ryoji 忍住了要么放声大笑要么介入取笑这三人的冲动。式波的出现并不意外；她大多数日子里都像猎犬一样尾随着真嗣的脚步。那天她拿起铲子时，他的下巴几乎都要掉下来了，尽管如此。

"I brought a bit, actually. Here." Shinji said.  
“其实我带了一点，这里。”真嗣说。

"Heh, being a waiter again, huh. Eat."  
“嘿，又当服务员了，是吧。吃吧。”

"But that's your bento, Asuka. It's okay, I brought a few ration-"  
"但那是你的便当，明日香。没关系，我带了几份配给——"

"I wasn't asking. Breakfast was hefty enough, I'll manage till the night. Eat."  
"我不是在征求你的意见。早餐已经够丰盛了，我能撑到晚上。你吃吧。"

"Maybe Ikari-kun is full, himse-"  
"或许碇君已经吃饱了，他自己——"

"Didn't ask you, either, _Rei_. I'm not saying it again, Shinji. You know the alternative."  
"也没问你，丽。我不会再说了，真嗣。你知道另一种选择的。"

"Uhm, thank you for the food, Asuka."  
"呃，谢谢你准备的饭菜，明日香。"

"Why are you thanking me? You're the one who cooked the stupid meal."  
"你谢我干嘛？是你做的那顿蠢饭。"

_I guess miracles are possible, after all._ Ryoji thought.  
我想奇迹终究是可能的，Ryoji 心想。

The penguin figurine came to mind. Shinji had told him Asuka also extended her good wishes through it, even though she had likely not helped in the slightest in its manufacturing. Any attempts to ask Shikinami about the Wunder's elusive Captain was either ignored or shut down instantly. It only fueled his curiosity and solidified his resolve to climb on the damned ship.  
那只企鹅雕像浮现在脑海中。Shinji 曾告诉他，Asuka 也通过它表达了她的祝福，尽管她在制造过程中可能一点忙也没帮上。任何试图向 Shikinami 询问 Wunder 号神秘船长的事情，要么被无视，要么立刻被拒绝。这只会激起他的好奇心，并坚定了他登上那艘该死船只的决心。

_I wonder if my mother likes penguins,_ he thought next. _Well, soon enough I'll get to ask her face to face. Do you like penguins? What is your stance on lemonade? Was my father really a hero? Why were you mean to Shinji? Why did you abandon me? Am I just not good enough?_  
我在想，我母亲会不会喜欢企鹅，他接着想。嗯，很快我就能当面问她了。你喜欢企鹅吗？你对柠檬水有什么看法？我父亲真的是个英雄吗？你为什么对 Shinji 那么刻薄？你为什么抛弃我？是不是我不够好？

As usual, the comforting words of his guardian easily brought the smile back. Even if his mother rejected him again, Viko would always be there. "Hey, Shinji," he said, catching the small group off guard. "What does 'Pen' mean? The thing you wrote on my present. Is it just an abbreviation for penguin?"  
一如既往，监护人安慰的话语轻易地让他重展笑颜。即便母亲再次拒绝了他，Viko 也会一直在那里。“嘿，真嗣，”他说着，让这个小团体措手不及。“‘Pen’是什么意思？你在我礼物上写的那个。是企鹅的缩写吗？”

Shinji gave him a sad smile, Rei blinked in surprise and Asuka scowled at the ground.  
真嗣给了他一个悲伤的微笑，绫波惊讶地眨了眨眼，而明日香则皱着眉头盯着地面。

"When I arrived in Tokyo 3, I was made to stay with your mother, Misato," Shinji started. He exchanged a glance with the redhead, who only shrugged in return. "She had a pet penguin, his name was Pen-pen. He was kind of like the ones who help us fish. Had a very… unique personality."  
“当我来到第三新东京市时，我被安排和你母亲美里住在一起，”真嗣开始说道。他与红发的女孩交换了一个眼神，她只是耸了耸肩作为回应。“她养了一只企鹅，名叫 Pen-pen。他有点像那些帮我们钓鱼的人。有着非常……独特的个性。”

"Dumb bird also drank beer," Asuka ground out. "A trick our great Captain surely taught him."  
"那只笨鸟还喝了啤酒，" 明日香咬牙切齿地说。"这招肯定是我们伟大的队长教他的。"

"Pfft, beer?" Ryoji chuckled more due to Rei's confused expression than the image of a penguin consuming alcohol. "Sounds like it was a fun place."  
"噗，啤酒？" 亮司轻笑，更多是因为零那困惑的表情，而不是想象中的企鹅喝酒的画面。"听起来是个有趣的地方。"

"According to the idiot, it was a mess," Asuka retorted. "Trash everywhere, empty cans and bottles, fast food containers on the floor and floating on the bathtub at times. She was lucky Shinji tidied up before I arrived."  
"据那白痴说，那里一团糟，" 明日香反驳道。"到处都是垃圾，空罐子和瓶子，地板上和浴缸里不时漂浮着快餐盒。她还算幸运，真嗣在我到之前已经收拾干净了。"

Both him and Shinji burst out laughing, and even Rei giggled lightly. Ryoji noticed color rise to the Major's face before she hid her expression under the hoodie. _Did she just make a joke? More miracles, huh._ The thought made him chortle harder. _Maybe it'll start raining people, dogs and fertile soil next._  
他和真嗣同时爆发出笑声，甚至连绫波也轻声笑了起来。六分仪注意到少校的脸颊泛起了红晕，随后她将表情藏在了连帽衫下。她刚才是讲了个笑话吗？真是奇迹频出啊。这个念头让他笑得更厉害了。或许接下来会开始下起人、狗和肥沃的土壤雨吧。

"It was also very fun," Shinji mentioned, looking up at the sky. "Misato loved to tease, and she laughed all the time. She also drove like a crazy person."  
“那也很有趣，”真嗣抬头望着天空说道，“美里喜欢逗乐，总是笑声不断。而且她开车简直像个疯子。”

"Meh, the last part hasn't changed, just ask the crew." More laughter, to which Asuka crossed her arms. "Terrible driver if I've ever seen one. Not a lousy captain, though, all things considered."  
“唉，最后一点倒是一点没变，问问船员们就知道了。”笑声再起，对此明日香交叉双臂，“我见过最糟糕的司机。不过，考虑到所有情况，她可不是个糟糕的船长。”

_Oh.  哦。_

For once in his entire life, somebody other than Viko or Kensuke spoke to Ryoji of his mother. They both seemed fond of her, even Shinji. Even after his mother placed a collar that could decapitate him at any given moment, twice, he still spoke of her with care and longing.  
在他的一生中，终于有人，除了 Viko 或 Kensuke 之外，向 Ryoji 谈起了他的母亲。他们似乎都很喜欢她，就连 Shinji 也不例外。即便他的母亲两次给他戴上了一个随时能斩首他的项圈，他依然对她充满关怀和思念。

"Thanks, you guys," he blurted out, not realizing how alike his mother he looked then. "Glad to know some of my natural charm came from her, after all."  
“谢谢你们，”他脱口而出，没意识到那一刻自己与母亲有多么相似。“很高兴知道我的一些自然魅力确实来自她。”

"Some charm, brat," Asuka muttered, yet he caught the small growl of mirth that escaped her. "Whatever. Hey, idiot," she turned to Shinji. "Didn't she pick you up during the first Angel attack?"  
"有点魅力嘛，小鬼。" 明日香嘀咕着，却捕捉到了她发出的轻微笑声。"随你怎么说。嘿，笨蛋，" 她转向真嗣。"她不是在第一次使徒袭击时救了你吗？"

"Uh, yeah. A few hours later I was piloting Unit 01. That day is really a fog."  
"嗯，是的。几个小时后我就开始驾驶初号机了。那天的事真是模糊不清。"

"A few hours. So, what I heard was true. You had no training whatsoever before that day, did you?"  
"几个小时。那么，我听说的没错。在那之前你根本没有任何训练，对吧？"

"No, none. But if I didn't pilot, then my father would have forced Ayanami to do it. She was brought out on a stretcher; her arm was in a cast and everything. I… I couldn't let her do that."  
"不，没有。但如果我不驾驶，我父亲就会强迫绫波去。她当时是被担架抬出来的；手臂打着石膏。我……我不能让她那样做。"

Rei's eyes perked at the mention of her predecessor. She had stayed quiet throughout the entire afternoon, keen on observing everything, giggling on occasion whenever either pilot felt embarrassed, and enjoying the bentos Shinji had brought. _Ah, I get it, Rei. It's fun to see them talk, isn't it? Something about it puts my mind at ease, like when Viko sings._  
听到前任驾驶员的名字，绫波的眼睛亮了起来。整个下午她都保持沉默，专注地观察着一切，偶尔在两位驾驶员感到尴尬时轻笑，享受着真嗣带来的便当。啊，我明白了，绫波。看他们聊天很有趣，对吧？这种感觉让我心安，就像听到维克唱歌一样。

"Typical of Gendo Ikari," Asuka hissed. Curious, how she held more resentment towards the madman than Shinji. "Fulfill the scenario by whatever means necessary. Tch, it's a wonder you managed to survive."  
"果然是碇源堂的风格，"明日香低声咒骂。奇怪的是，她对那个疯子的怨恨比对真嗣还要深。"无论如何都要完成剧本。哼，你能活下来真是奇迹。"

"I didn't do anything," Shinji responded quietly. "Unit 01 went berserk and killed that Angel."  
"我什么都没做，" 真嗣平静地回应。"初号机暴走，杀死了那个使徒。"

"Uh huh." Asuka's tone took Ryoji by surprise. "Unit 01 didn't go berserk with the next one, though. Had you not piloted the Eva, this dumb village would be minus a dumb commander and a half-assed physician. According to the official report, anyway."  
"嗯哼。" 明日香的语气让良治感到意外。"不过初号机对下一个使徒并没有暴走。如果你没有驾驶 Eva，这个愚蠢的村庄就会少一个愚蠢的指挥官和一个半吊子的医生。至少官方报告上是这么说的。"

_Is she… complimenting him?_ Ryoji's jaw almost slackened at the realization. _Like, complementing his piloting? Her? Didn't she have a grudge against it or something?_  
她是在……夸他吗？良治意识到这一点时，下巴几乎都要掉下来了。就像，夸赞他的驾驶技术？她？她不是对这有什么怨气吗？

"Well, I didn't really have much of a choice, since Toji and Kensuke snuck out of the shelter," Shinji looked down at his hand. "Suddenly I open my eyes and they're both just feet from being crushed by Unit 01's fingers."  
“呃，我其实没太多选择，因为真治和健介偷偷溜出了避难所，”真嗣低头看着自己的手，“我突然睁开眼，他们俩差点就被初号机的手指压扁了。”

"Miss Hikari would not approve of such behavior," Rei noted, which elicited more laughs from both youngsters, and a derisive growl from Asuka. "She appeared very displeased with her husband this morning."  
“小光老师肯定不会赞同这种行为，”绫波指出，这引得两个年轻人再次大笑，而明日香则发出了一声轻蔑的咕哝，“她今早看起来对她丈夫非常不满。”

"Well, he almost died in both situations. Did you see how much he drank last night? Guy was _plastered_." Ryoji said. He tossed a ripe pear to each and stretched. Asuka caught it midair, Shinji panicked and dropped it, whereas Rei did not react at all. Her pear landed just beside her feet. "Anyway, I promised Koga I'd help with some chores. See you guys around. Thanks for the help! Five new trees to name in four years!"  
“好吧，他在两种情况下都差点丧命。你昨晚看到他喝了多少吗？那家伙烂醉如泥。” 凉二说道。他扔给每人一个熟透的梨，然后伸了个懒腰。明日香在空中接住了梨，真嗣慌乱中掉了梨，而绫波毫无反应，她的梨就落在她脚边。“总之，我答应过高我帮忙做些杂务。回头见，伙计们。谢谢帮忙！四年里又多了五棵树要命名！”

Asuka shrugged, Shinji shook his hand and Rei gave him a sunny smile.  
明日香耸了耸肩，真嗣摇了摇手，而绫波则给了他一个灿烂的微笑。

Quick on his feet, Ryoji sprinted back to Hikari, said his goodbyes and left for home. Every step he took solidified his resolve. The villagers were gathering more supplies than usual. If some final battle was about to ensue, he would see his mother at least once before it all ended.  
敏捷如他，亮二迅速跑回光身边，道别后便返回家中。每一步都坚定了他的决心。村民们正在比平时更多地收集物资。如果一场决战即将来临，他至少要在一切结束前见母亲一面。

The Wunder would land soon. His chance was finally at hand.  
Wunder 号即将降落。他的机会终于近在咫尺。

"I'll be right back, quick stop and go," he told one of the younger watermelons, and pretended it was his guardian. "Just one glance, once conversation. Two questions. That's all I want. You won't even notice I'm gone."  
"我马上回来，快去快回，"他对其中一个较小的西瓜说，假装那是他的监护人。"就一眼，一次对话。两个问题。这就是我想要的。你甚至不会注意到我离开。"

---

"You think I wouldn't catch it?"  
"你以为我会察觉不到吗？"

Shinji flinched under her stern gaze, but did not shy away when Asuka snatched his hand and began prodding around his elbow and shoulder blade. She caught three small hisses near the more noticeable bruises. No swelling or infection lingered anywhere.  
真嗣在她严厉的目光下退缩了，但当明日香抓住他的手，开始在他的肘部和肩胛骨周围摸索时，他没有退缩。她在他明显的瘀伤附近听到了三声轻微的吸气声。没有肿胀或感染的迹象。

"The bandage fell off," he revealed. "But I made sure to wash the cuts like you said. They don't sting or anything."  
"绷带掉了，"他透露道。"但我按照你说的清洗了伤口。现在一点也不疼了。"

"Is that so," Asuka replied, tone flat. She took the opportunity to glimpse at the scar around Shinji's wrist. "You were looking at your arm after that last stupid plant. Told you to stop digging holes."  
"是吗，"明日香语气平淡地回应。她趁机瞥了一眼真嗣手腕上的疤痕。"上次那棵蠢植物之后，你就一直在看你的手臂。我告诉过你别再挖坑了。"

"Sorry." “对不起。”

"Ugh. Idiot." "呃。笨蛋。"

Asuka rolled her eye and finished her 'examination'. The sky was already ridden with stars by the time they walked back to the house. _Good riddance,_ she thought. _No way in hell I'm helping that useless four-eyes after the crap he pulled yesterday. Tch, even went and got drunk afterwards. Pathetic._  
明日香翻了个白眼，结束了她的'检查'。当他们走回房子时，天空已被星星点缀。她心想，真是解脱了。昨天他那副德行，我绝不会再帮那个没用的四眼。啧，事后还喝得烂醉。真是可悲。

"Thank you," Shinji muttered after a while, which only earned him a disgruntled grunt. "There's still lots of leftovers from the party, I'll make us some dinner."  
"谢谢你，" 真嗣过了一会儿才小声说道，只换来一声不满的咕哝。"派对上还有很多剩菜，我来做晚饭吧。"

"Good." She stopped mid-step and grabbed Shinji's shoulder. "What are you thanking me for?"  
"好。" 她停下脚步，抓住了真嗣的肩膀。"你谢我什么？"

Not shrinking under her glare as usual, Shinji offered a timid half-smile. "For coming along today and helping out in the field. The day flew by without me noticing."  
没有像往常那样在她瞪视下退缩，真嗣怯生生地露出了半个微笑。“谢谢你今天一起来帮忙田里的活儿，时间过得飞快，我都没注意到。”

"Don't blame your foggy little mind on me. Not my fault you can't tell the time," Asuka retorted, then pointed at the clearing. "Your dumb tree seems to be doing well enough."  
“别把你的糊涂脑袋怪到我头上，时间感差可不是我的错，”明日香反驳道，然后指向空地，“你那棵傻树看起来倒是长得不错。”

"You have a few of your own, now," Shinji said. "Have you thought of any names?"  
“你现在也有几棵了，”真嗣说，“有没有想过给它们起什么名字？”

"Heh. Not happening. I never said I'd partake in that foolish tradition."  
"呵呵，不可能。我从没说过我会参与那个愚蠢的传统。"

He walked next to her, and was not at all discouraged by her words. _Pisses me off,_ the Major barked in discomfort. _Just stay away like everybody else! Stop making me feel uneasy!_ Despite the protestations, relief washed over Asuka instead of anger or mistrust. Akin to that night years before, it felt like they could be lonely together.  
他走在她身边，对她的言语毫不气馁。真让人恼火，少校不悦地咆哮道。就像其他人一样离我远点！别让我感到不安！尽管有抗议，但阿斯纳却感到一阵释然，而非愤怒或猜疑。就像多年前的那晚一样，他们仿佛可以一起孤独。

They arrived to a muted house aside from Kensuke's loud snores. Minutes later, wood was smoldering outside, and hot coals were being shoved into the home-made stove. Asuka lay in bed and played with the WonderSwan while the food warmed. More than once her eye drifted to the closet, where the small plush toy sat.  
他们来到一间除了健介响亮的鼾声外寂静无声的房子。几分钟后，屋外的木柴开始冒烟，自制炉子里的热炭被推入。明日香躺在床上玩着 WonderSwan，同时食物在加热。她不止一次地瞥向衣柜，那里放着那个小毛绒玩具。

_When did he get so quick at doing all those chores? Cooking and cleaning I get. Old muscle memory and whatnot. But making fires, planting trees?_ Asuka thought, increasingly distracted. _Saw him glancing at the clay pieces, it wouldn't surprise me if he starts rebuilding those malformed cups of his._  
他什么时候变得这么麻利了？做饭和打扫我还能理解，老肌肉记忆什么的。但生火、种树？明日香越想越分心。看他瞥向那些陶器碎片，他要是开始重塑那些不成形的杯子，我也不会惊讶。

For the first time in many years, she lost four games in a role. The timer stopped ticking, and something close to drowsiness encroached her awareness. Her fingers moved in circles around the handheld's buttons instead of pressing them with unnecessary force. A blister had burst near her thumb while working. Shinji had been the one to see the small blood stain on the shovel. Seeing him dash towards Hikari and return with a piece of cloth and water had almost made her laugh out loud.  
多年来第一次，她连输四局。计时器停止了跳动，一种近似困倦的感觉侵袭了她的意识。她的手指在手持游戏机的按键周围打转，而不是用力按下它们。工作时拇指旁的水泡已经破裂。真嗣是第一个注意到铲子上的小血迹的人。看到他冲向光并带回一块布和水，差点让她笑出声来。

Wrinkled as it was, the improvised bandaged had held and ran across her thumb like a ring. The idiot's hands had shaken throughout the entire ordeal. _All that fuss for a tiny blister. I don't think he realizes I almost cost him a hand with that infected wound._  
尽管皱巴巴的，这个临时绷带还是固定住了，像戒指一样缠绕在她的拇指上。那个傻瓜在整个过程中手都在颤抖。为一个小水泡这么大惊小怪。我想他还没意识到我差点因为那个感染的伤口让他失去一只手。

Remnants of the night before washed over. Ocean breeze, shade, and Shinji's deep, even breathing beside her. Warmth of another body, soft, overgrown brown locks caught in her hands. Hesitant half-smirks, growing gentler by the day. Deep blue eyes gazing at her with admiration, care and longing.  
昨夜的余韵袭来。海风轻拂，树荫婆娑，以及身旁真嗣深沉均匀的呼吸。另一具身体的温暖，柔软的、略显凌乱的棕发缠绕在她指间。犹豫的半笑，日渐温柔。深蓝色的眼眸带着欣赏、关怀与渴望凝视着她。

The device beeped. _'YOU LOST! PLAY AGAIN? Y/N'_  
设备发出哔哔声。'你输了！再来一局？是/否'

A few knocks on the door announced supper was ready, so she turned off the WonderSwan and tossed it aside with little care. As they ate and she threw the occasional jab that made him chuckle, Asuka counted each time Shinji reached for his head. His eyes would grow distracted, closed on occasion as his features unwound.  
几声敲门声宣告晚餐已备好，于是她关掉 WonderSwan，随手扔到一旁。用餐时，她偶尔抛出的俏皮话逗得他轻笑，而她则数着真嗣伸手摸头的次数。他的眼神会变得恍惚，偶尔闭上眼，神情逐渐放松。

Her chest began to ache and constrict after the plate was empty, and Shinji tried again to engage in conversation. He spoke of the chores that awaited the next day. He shared the concern for the Idiot Tree being ravaged by insects or rainfall, and ultimately confirmed her suspicions of wishing to repair the broken cups, or craft new ones if necessary.  
盘子空了之后，她的胸口开始隐隐作痛并紧缩起来，真嗣再次尝试展开对话。他谈到了第二天等待着他们的家务活。他表达了对那棵傻瓜树被虫害或雨水侵蚀的担忧，并最终证实了她对想要修复破损杯子，或者必要时制作新杯子的猜疑。

"Your annoying bird friends must be wondering where you went," Asuka said after dinner. "They're used to seeing you every day."  
“你那些烦人的鸟朋友们肯定在纳闷你去哪儿了，”晚餐后明日香说道，“它们习惯了每天见到你。”

"I'm pretty sure they've taken a liking to you, as well," Shinji answered. "The leader sat next to you at lunch last time."  
“我敢肯定它们也喜欢上了你，”真嗣回答，“上次午餐时，领头的那只就坐在你旁边。”

They moved outside the house like before, only for some reason, it was her who started combating the sudden urge to close her eyes. _So tired,_ Asuka thought, slightly alarmed. _All I did was go outside and plant some stupid trees. Hell, I sat under the shade for most of it. What is this?_  
他们像往常一样走出屋外，但不知为何，这次是她开始抵抗突然想闭上眼睛的冲动。真累啊，明日香心想，略感惊慌。我所做的不过是出去种了几棵愚蠢的树。天哪，大部分时间我还坐在树荫下呢。这是怎么回事？

"He just wanted to snack on my lunch. Creepy bird." Asuka shook her head in a vain attempt to clear it. "Stands next to you sometimes like a dog, it's weird."  
“他只是想偷吃我的午餐。讨厌的鸟。”明日香摇了摇头，徒劳地试图清醒。“有时候就像条狗一样站在你旁边，真奇怪。”

"Maybe he just wants a friend." Tired as she felt, she caught the change in Shinji's tone. "Being lonely is awful."  
“也许他只是想要个朋友。”尽管感到疲惫，她还是察觉到了真嗣语气的变化。“孤独真的很糟糕。”

"Can't be lonely if it's surrounded by its own kind, can it?" she argued, yet blinked at the irony of her own statement. "Eh, suppose it can. Awful, huh." A surge of bitterness ran through her. "Guess it's so awful than even someone like me can pass up for decent company, then."  
"如果被同类包围，就不会感到孤独，对吧？" 她争辩道，却对自己话中的讽刺意味眨了眨眼。"呃，也许会吧。真糟糕，是吧。" 一股苦涩涌上心头。"我想，糟糕到连我这样的人都能被视为不错的伙伴，那就太糟糕了。"

It boiled within; anger, desperation, sadness, hope, and longing bled out the moment Asuka's strength began to wane. She wanted more time, only a little bit. A small do-over. Fantasies. Who would want more time with her?  
情感在内心沸腾；愤怒、绝望、悲伤、希望和渴望在明日香的力量开始衰退时流露出来。她想要更多时间，哪怕只是一点点。一个小小的重来。幻想。谁会想和她共度更多时光呢？

"I don't understand." Shinji ventured after a moment. "Someone like you?"  
"我不明白。" 真嗣片刻后开口道。"像你这样的人？"

_A freak, Shinji_. Asuka thought with every bit of misery coiling in her core. _A soldier_. _An ageless half-breed clone incapable of being gentle or even human._ "I'm not exactly Hikari, with her boundless positive energy, much less Toji with his naïve, boastful self. I'm not Kensuke, with his dumb optimism. I'm not your precious little clone, Rei. If you're feeling so lonely, maybe you just go to people who can help you with that."  
一个怪胎，真嗣。明日香心中满是苦涩地想着。一个战士。一个不会老去的半人半克隆体，无法温柔，甚至不像人类。“我可不是光，她那无穷无尽的正能量，更别提像剑介那样天真自夸的家伙。我不是班长，没有他那愚蠢的乐观。我也不是你那珍贵的克隆人，绫波。如果你感到如此孤独，或许你该去找那些能帮你的人。”

_Yeah, get away. It's all for nothing, in the end. Like we've ever had a chance, like we're ever going to win this never-ending war. Go enjoy what little time you have left with that girl who likes you so much.  
是啊，走开吧。反正到头来一切都是徒劳。就像我们从未有过机会，就像我们永远赢不了这场无休止的战争。去享受你和那个如此喜欢你的女孩所剩无几的时光吧。_

"Actually," Shinji said. He offered a small, hesitant smile. "I'm not feeling lonely, right now."  
“实际上，”真嗣说。他露出了一个微小而犹豫的微笑。“我现在并不感到孤独。”

The next harsh remark died on her lips. _Me neither, you idiot. That's why I'm trying to break it, because it's not going to last anyway. How about being the dumb little brat again?_  
下一句尖刻的话在她唇边消散。我也是，你这个白痴。这就是为什么我试图打破它，因为它无论如何都不会持久。不如再做回那个愚蠢的小鬼头？

Instead, the 'brat' in question took a deep breath and reduced the distance between them by a few millimeters. "Hikari's always happy, but I can see the lines under her eyes," he said. "Toji stays strong mostly because he has to. So many people depend on him keeping a level mind. And Kensuke… he molded himself into the leader the village wanted. I bet it's exhausting."  
相反，那个所谓的‘小鬼’深吸了一口气，将他们之间的距离缩短了几毫米。“光总是很快乐，但我能看到她眼下的黑眼圈，”他说。“阿薰大部分时间保持坚强是因为他必须如此。太多人依赖他保持冷静的头脑。而真希...他把自己塑造成了村子想要的领导者。我敢打赌这很累人。”

"What does any of that have to do with your idiotic self being lonely?" Asuka demanded.  
“这些和你这个白痴感到孤独有什么关系？”明日香质问道。

"I…" Shinji gulped and avoided eye contact as he spoke. "Sometimes even if I'm with them, I feel alone. Does that happen to you?"  
"我…" 真嗣咽了口唾沫，避开眼神接触说道。"有时候即使和他们在一起，我也感到孤独。你有过这种感觉吗？"

_Touché. 说得好。_

"More or less," she admitted. "You look content enough around Misato's spawn."  
"或多或少吧，" 她承认道。"你在美里家的小鬼们身边看起来挺满足的。"

"Yeah," Shinji scratched at his head. Her eye narrowed at the way he curled the locks in between his fingers. "Even then, though. Sometimes that hollow feeling comes out of nowhere and swallows everything else."  
"是啊，" 真嗣挠了挠头。她眯起眼睛，看着他用手指卷起发丝的样子。"即便如此，那种空虚感有时会突然出现，吞噬一切。"

"Like wave after wave," Asuka added with a nod. "Drowning out everything else."  
"就像一波接一波的浪潮，" 明日香点头补充道。"淹没其他一切。"

Kensuke's company was appreciated, but it never did much to quench the thirst gnawing at her insides without reprieve. Mari was the same, regardless of how much effort the bespectacled woman put into trying to connect with her.  
虽然很感激健介的陪伴，但这并不能缓解她内心那股无休止的渴望。无论眼镜女玛丽如何努力试图与她建立联系，结果都是一样的。

"I could be in the ration center with everyone, or listening to Ryoji's jokes, and then," Shinji's gaze drifted to the stars. "I'm curled up in the entry plug. Kaworu just exploded in my face. I'm completely alone."  
"我本可以在物资分配中心和大家一起，或是听著谅的笑话，然后，" 真嗣的目光飘向星空。"我蜷缩在插入栓里。薰就在我面前爆炸了。我完全孤身一人。"

"And at which point does the proverbial me come and kick you to the side?" she asked with a hint if bemusement.  
"那在什么时候，所谓的我才会来把你踢到一边呢？" 她带着一丝戏谑问道。"

"Pretty much right away, on most occasions," acknowledged Shinji with a nod and a chuckle. "A few weeks ago, though," he looked down at the scar on his wrist with something akin to affection. "You had to literally beat some sense into me or shake me out of it. People could be talking to me, and I wouldn't listen. I don't know, but ever since that day in the cell… your voice came through."  
"基本上马上就会，大多数情况下，" 真嗣点头笑着承认。"不过几周前，" 他低头看着手腕上的伤疤，带着几分亲切。"你得实实在在地打醒我，或者把我摇醒。人们可能在对我说什么，我根本听不进去。我不知道，但从那天在牢房里开始……你的声音传了过来。"

"_Chew,"_ she heard her own voice break again. _"Please."_  
"嚼吧，" 她听到自己的声音再次哽咽。"求你了。"

"Whatever, you're rambling nonsense again." Asuka dismissed the memory and rubbed at her eye. "So you don't feel lonely around me because I poured disinfectant on a cut I gave you and shoveled a couple of food rations down your throat? Don't you find that a little messed up?"  
"随你怎么说，你又开始胡言乱语了。" 明日香挥散了那段记忆，揉了揉眼睛。"所以你在我给你伤口倒消毒水、硬塞了几份口粮给你吃后，并不觉得在我身边孤单？你不觉得这有点乱套吗？"

"Not really," Shinji replied. His nonchalance to her cutting words was infuriating in the most endearing of ways. "You're Asuka," he said. "Eva piloting aside, you're sort of the most interesting person I've ever met. Being around you is… really nice."  
"倒也没有，" 真嗣回答。他对她尖锐话语的漠然态度，以一种最令人心暖的方式激怒了她。"你是明日香，" 他说。"抛开 Eva 驾驶不谈，你大概是我遇到过最有意思的人。在你身边……真的很美好。"

A loud click rang through the air when Shinji forced his jaw shut. They sat close enough to one another that she felt the shift in his weight. He did not pull away, however. _Nice, huh. You're still so fidgety,_ Asuka thought. _Like I'm about to hit you at any given chance. Eh, not entirely your fault I suppose._  
当真嗣用力合上嘴巴时，一声响亮的咔哒声在空气中回荡。他们坐得如此之近，以至于她能感觉到他体重的变化。然而，他并没有退缩。不错，是吧。你还是那么坐立不安，明日香心想。就像我随时都可能揍你一顿似的。嗯，也不完全是你的错，我想。

Exhaustion was surely the reason why her head came to rest on Shinji's shoulder. "It is?" she rasped, uncaring of how little, or incredulous she sounded. "You'd be the first person to think so. I've never been good enough at anything I was designed to be."  
疲惫无疑是她将头靠在真嗣肩上的原因。“是吗？”她沙哑地问道，不在乎自己听起来是多么的微不足道或难以置信。“你会是第一个这么想的人。我从未在我被设计要做的事情上做得足够好。”

It was not sleep, not truly. She was conscious the entire time, but somehow Asuka's muscles unwound and her mind stilled. No timer ran to zero in her brain. Shinji barely moved for hours as she dozed and unconsciously curled closer.  
那不是真正的睡眠。她一直保持着清醒，但不知怎的，明日香的肌肉放松了，思绪也平静下来。她的脑海中没有计时器归零。真嗣几乎一动不动地坐了几个小时，而她打盹时无意识地蜷缩得更近了。

Somewhere in the night one of Shinji's hands found its way to her hair. Cautious to not disturb her, he slowly let his fingers thread through the tresses and gently massage her scalp, as she'd done the night before.  
夜色中的某个时刻，真嗣的一只手不知不觉地找到了她的头发。他小心翼翼地不惊扰她，慢慢地让手指穿过发丝，轻轻按摩她的头皮，就像她前一晚所做的那样。

"You're Asuka," Shinji repeated in the early morning. "That'll always be enough."  
"你是明日香，"清晨时分，真嗣重复道，"这就已经足够了。"

---

"It'll never be enough." "这永远不够。"

Misato's head banged against the steel table of her chamber. The glass of watered-down rum slipped left and right along with the vessel, occasionally finding its way to her hand. She sloshed down the content and refilled it at every chance. With about four to five 'nights' left to indulge, the crew had taken to emptying the alcohol reserves in celebration.  
美里将头重重地撞在她的舱室钢桌上。掺水的朗姆酒杯随着船身左右滑动，偶尔落入她手中。她趁机一饮而尽，并随时重新斟满。距离放纵的‘夜晚’还剩四到五天，船员们已经开始庆祝，将酒储备一扫而空。

Only Ritsuko came with a glass of actual sake she kept hidden, and toasted to her son's health with her.  
只有律子带着她藏起来的真正清酒前来，与她一起为儿子的健康干杯。

"Pfft, two broken down Evangelions, a completely useless one, and the corpse of an old monster," she slurred, drank and refilled. "Going against the Devil himself, who's armed to the teeth with an army of awakened Evas, and his own little god-like machine. What a joke."  
“噗，两台报废的 EVA，一台完全没用的，还有一具老怪物的尸体，”她含糊地说着，喝了一口又倒满。“对抗魔鬼本人，他武装到牙齿，带着一支觉醒的 EVA 大军，还有他那台神一般的机器。真是笑话。”

The empty chair opposite to Misato only broadened the wretchedness rotting her chest. Kaji would sit there at times, before his life ended, and give her that calm smirk of his. Their child had seen yet another year on this earth without even knowing what she looked like, or who she was.  
对面空着的椅子只让美里胸中的痛苦更加深重。有时，在生命终结之前，加持会坐在那里，给她一个平静的微笑。他们的孩子又在这个世界上度过了一年，却连她的样子或身份都不知道。

"Better that way," she argued with the non-existent guest. "After the way I behaved with Shinji, the way I'm forced to treat Asuka and Mari like fighting dogs, kept in a cage until I have need of them…" Nausea made her world spin worse than the turbulent weather. "I can't even get justice for his father, or ensure he grows up in a world that isn't dying."  
“这样也好，”她对着不存在的客人争辩道，“在我那样对待真嗣之后，我被迫像对待斗狗一样对待明日香和玛丽，把她们关在笼子里，直到我有需要……”恶心感让她的世界比恶劣的天气还要旋转得厉害。“我甚至无法为他的父亲伸张正义，也无法确保他在一个不正在死去的世界中成长。”

A few feet away, the trigger to the DSS chokers mocked her further.  
几英尺外，DSS 项圈的触发器进一步嘲笑着她。

"He's Shinji's age, already, can you believe that?" As usual, ghost Kaji had no answer. "I told a boy my son's age that everything was his fault, and left him to rot in a cell. What would our son think about that?"  
"他现在和真嗣一样大，你能相信吗？" 像往常一样，幽灵加持没有回答。"我告诉了一个和我儿子同龄的男孩，一切都是他的错，然后让他烂在牢房里。我们的儿子会怎么想这件事呢？"

_I bet they've become friends,_ her mind provided with her husband's voice. _Shinji's not the type to badmouth anyone. If anything, he'll probably try to paint you in a positive light!_  
我敢打赌他们已经成了朋友，她的脑海中浮现出丈夫的声音。真嗣不是那种会说别人坏话的人。如果有什么的话，他可能会尽力把你描绘得正面一些！

"I know," Misato grumbled. A sob broke through her, followed by a stream of unwanted tears. "I don't deserve his kindness. I don't deserve to see my son… not until I do at least one thing right."  
"我知道，" 美里咕哝着。一声呜咽打破了她的平静，接着是一串不请自来的泪水。"我不配得到他的善意。我不配见到我的儿子……除非我能做对至少一件事。"

_You have to believe in them, that's all._ Kaji smiled and leaned forward, catching her cheek in his hand. _Even Shinji. Have hope in them, and they'll guide you to victory. They'll guide you back to our son._  
你必须相信他们，仅此而已。加持微笑着向前倾身，用手托住她的脸颊。即使是真嗣。对他们抱有希望，他们将引导你走向胜利。他们会引导你回到我们的儿子身边。

Her lip shook with vehemence. "Shinji," she saw the look of utter betrayal again, followed by the dead stare he had brought back to the ship. "I'm sorry."  
她的嘴唇因激动而颤抖。“真嗣，”她再次看到了那彻底背叛的眼神，紧接着是他带回船上的死寂目光。“对不起。”

Discontent ran wild in the crew as of late. Many wished to see the Village only so they could hunt Shinji down and use him as some sort of leverage against his father. She had laughed with plenty bitterness upon hearing the proposal. Gendo Ikari would skin his son alive with a spoon if it meant his admission would come true.  
最近，船员们的不满情绪肆意蔓延。许多人希望看到村庄，只是为了追捕真嗣，并利用他作为对付他父亲的某种筹码。听到这个提议时，她苦笑着，充满了苦涩。碇源堂会用勺子活剥他儿子的皮，如果这意味着他的计划能成真。

Others were convinced the Third Child represented everything they fought against. They wore a green rag signaling their belief in a green world, one where Shinji was no longer a threat that covered the world in red waste. Toji's little sister was not with them, but shared the sentiment that the boy was a liability and a hazard. They'd surely argue if by some freak accident the need to use the purple Eva arose.  
其他人坚信第三适格者代表了一切他们所反对的事物。他们佩戴着绿色布条，象征着对一个绿色世界的信仰，在那里，真嗣不再是覆盖世界的红色废墟的威胁。东治的妹妹虽未与他们同行，却同样认为这个男孩是个负担和危险。若因某种偶然需要启用紫色 EVA，他们定会争论不休。

_Tch, as if the world being as it is was his fault at all. Great job at expressing that sentiment when Unit 01 spat him out, Katsuragi. Remember how you were cheering him on, fourteen years ago? You filthy hypocrite. Asuka's always been right.  
切，仿佛世界变成这样全是他的错似的。卡特拉斯基，你真行，在零一机把他吐出来时表达这种情绪。还记得十四年前你是如何为他加油的吗？你这虚伪的家伙。明日香一直是对的。_

"Pilot the Eva, don't pilot the Eva." Misato threw the glass against the wall and held her head in her hands. "It's all your fault, and at the same time, it's not. Don't do anything, but don't just sit there and die either." She sighed in derision. "Ryoji's better off. I'd be a terrible parent."  
"“驾驶 EVA，不驾驶 EVA。”美里将玻璃杯摔向墙壁，双手抱头。“这都是你的错，同时又不是。什么都不做，但也不能坐以待毙。”她轻蔑地叹息。“良治更幸运。我会是个糟糕的父母。”

The last few were Mari, her old tech crew, Ritsuko, and two to three other weird sailors who held some blind belief in victory. According to the latest reports, Shinji had cultivated a small group of sympathizers in the ship, and had been basically adopted by Village 3.  
最后几位是玛丽，她的旧技术团队，律子，还有两三个其他古怪的水手，他们怀揣着对胜利的盲目信念。根据最新报告，真嗣在船上培养了一小群同情者，并且基本上被第三村收养了。

_If I could only give you one victory. Just once, let you both live your lives in peace. How can I look my son in the eye, knowing I dragged a boy his age to this mess, then blamed him for it?  
如果我只能给你一次胜利。就这一次，让你们俩都能在和平中生活。我怎么有脸面对我的儿子，明知我把他同龄的一个男孩拖入了这场混乱，然后又为此责怪他？_

"Ugh, that's the way to start the morning," Misato muttered to the empty chamber, and took a swig of stale, recycled water. "Isn't that right, Pen-Pen?"  
“呃，这可真是个糟糕的早晨开始方式。”美里对着空荡荡的房间喃喃自语，喝了一口陈旧、循环使用的水。“对吧，Pen-Pen？”

Her feet dragged without much coordination when she got up to glare through the hatch. The broken remnants of Earth glared back, as though exasperated with her limited resources, continued defeats, and bitterness.  
她起身透过舱门怒视时，脚步拖沓，毫无协调可言。地球的残骸同样回以怒视，仿佛对她的有限资源、连绵败绩和苦涩心境感到恼火。

---

The sickness came over her without warning.  
疾病毫无预警地袭来。

Rei convulsed and fell to the floor next to Tsubame, barely conscious enough to miss the crib by a few inches as she fell. Her head bounced on the ground, but by that point the visions were so intense that pain stopped being processed.  
丽突然抽搐着跌倒在燕的身旁，意识模糊到仅差几英寸就撞上婴儿床。她的头重重地磕在地上，但那时幻象太过强烈，痛感已无法被感知。

Lilith glared down as she always did, with a curtain of crimson at all sides. Her sisters stood in an empty room, unmoving, waiting to die at their creator's whim. Every cell in her body rebelled and sought to escape, to disintegrate into nothing. Agony kicked in at last, mingled with what she had learned was called despair. Her body struggled to keep itself together, while the timer in the plugsuit slowly reached zero.  
莉莉丝一如既往地俯视着，四周血红如幕。她的姐妹们站在空荡的房间里，一动不动，等待着在创造者的随意摆布下死去。她体内的每一个细胞都在反抗，试图逃离，化为乌有。痛苦终于袭来，混杂着她所学到的名为绝望的情感。她的身体挣扎着维持完整，而插在紧身衣里的计时器缓缓归零。

By sheer luck, the violent shaking made one of the last syringes fall close to Rei's hand. With whatever reason left, she stuck the needle into her neck. The fluid coursed through her corroding bloodstream and brought it to some level of stasis.  
纯属侥幸，剧烈的摇晃让最后一支注射器落在了绫波零的手边。她用仅存的理智，将针头扎入自己的颈部。液体在她腐蚀的血液中奔流，使其暂时进入了一种静止状态。

Long after the episode passed, she remained on the ground and stared at the carpeted floor. It did not hurt, not in the way Shinji's injuries did. If anything, she was becoming numb to everything but her emotions.  
事件过去许久后，她仍躺在地上，凝视着铺着地毯的地面。这并不痛，不像真嗣的伤那样。如果说有什么感觉，她对一切正变得麻木，除了她的情感。

The shuffling and shaking woke Tsubame. The baby stared with those big, innocent eyes so alike her own. Soon, she would be but a faded memory in the youngest Horaki's mind, a ghost who had once walked through their household and basked in their company, only to fade away into thin air.  
窸窣与颤动唤醒了燕。婴儿用那双与她如出一辙的大而纯真的眼睛凝视着。很快，她将成为最年幼的堀崎心中一个模糊的记忆，一个曾在家中行走、享受家人陪伴的幽灵，最终消散于无形。

"Perhaps the Idiot Tree will grow so large it will provide shade," she whispered to Tsubame, who gurgled in delight. "And they will sit under it and enjoy each other's company. I… only wanted to be near him, forever. Being close would have sufficed."  
“或许那棵傻瓜树会长得很大，提供阴凉，”她轻声对燕说，燕则发出愉悦的咕噜声。“他们会坐在树下，享受彼此的陪伴。我……只想永远靠近他。只要能亲近就足够了。”

Only two more syringes remained. Just enough to see her through a couple of days, just enough to see the Wunder land.  
只剩下两支注射器了。刚好够她撑过几天，刚好够她见识奇迹之地。

"I understand this was a preordained purpose for me, but I am at peace with it," Rei revealed while the baby pulled on her hair. "I just wish I had more time to be with the boy I liked."  
"我明白这是我命中注定的使命，但我对此心安理得，" 丽透露道，同时婴儿拉扯着她的头发。"我只希望有更多时间与我所喜欢的男孩相处。"

She went about the day as normal, made her best attempt at cooking the rice puddings Shinji had complimented, and smiled whenever Hikari 'teased' her. She visited the fields in the afternoon, realizing she'd not be able to collect the harvest, or watch as the trees she and Asuka had planted grew.  
她像往常一样度过这一天，尽力烹饪了真嗣曾称赞过的米布丁，每当光'戏弄'她时都会微笑。下午她去了田野，意识到自己将无法收获庄稼，也无法见证她和明日香种下的树木成长。

"Do not dwell on bad thoughts, or think on the future," Rei recited whilst walking towards the ruins, where Shinji and the penguins surely awaited. "Every moment counts. Every smile, every meal."  
"不要沉溺于消极的想法，也不要过多考虑未来，" 丽一边走向废墟，那里真嗣和企鹅们肯定在等着她，一边吟诵着。"每一刻都至关重要。每一个微笑，每一顿饭。"

The makeshift kitchen had been repaired to an extent. The dark stains on the Second Child's attire indicated she had 'soiled her hands in mud', and mended the damage as best she could. Shinji seemed apprehensive, almost shy around her.  
临时搭建的厨房已修复到一定程度。二号适格者衣服上的深色污渍表明她曾‘弄脏双手于泥泞’，并尽其所能地修补了损坏。真嗣在她周围显得有些局促不安，甚至害羞。

_He is surprised, and does not know how to express his gratitude,_ Rei thought. _My feelings are similar, you have given me so much, already._  
他感到惊讶，不知如何表达感激之情，零想。我的感受也相似，你已经给予了我这么多。

"Here, eat," Asuka pushed a crudely made cup in her direction. "Porridge, or whatever was left of it from the party. No meat, and not a word about this to anyone."  
“来，吃吧，”明日香将一个粗制滥造的杯子推到她面前。“粥，或者是派对剩下的东西。没有肉，而且对任何人都不许提这件事。”

"May I assist with repairs tomorrow?" Rei asked instead. She took the offered meal and presented her own contribution. "I would like to try to make a cup, as well."  
“明天我可以帮忙修理吗？”丽转而问道。她接过递来的餐食，并展示了自己的贡献。“我也想试着做一个杯子。”

"Of course, Rei," Shinji murmured. "This tastes great! I was planning on rebuilding a little, as well. I'd love some help."  
“当然可以，丽，”真嗣低声说。“这味道真棒！我也打算稍微重建一下。很高兴有你的帮助。”

The sun was warm against her skin, the breeze cool and pleasant. She felt complete sitting there, offering the sporadic comment and observing Asuka begrudgingly become less guarded. Shinji did not stray behind. There was a quiet strength to him lately, a kindling fire in his eyes.  
阳光温暖地洒在她的肌肤上，微风凉爽宜人。她坐在那里，偶尔发表评论，观察着明日香不情愿地逐渐放下戒备。真嗣也没有落后。最近他身上有一种安静的力量，眼中仿佛点燃了一簇火焰。

"This is pleasant," Rei announced. The displeasure coursing through her body dissipated, consumed by happiness. "It is good to have… friends."  
"这真是愉快," 丽宣布道。她体内涌动的不悦感消散了，被幸福感所吞噬。"有……朋友真好。"

Shinji blushed and mumbled something incoherent. Asuka fixed her with a glare, but she easily saw the smile hiding underneath.  
真嗣脸红了，含糊地咕哝着什么。明日香瞪了她一眼，但她轻易地看到了那隐藏在下面的微笑。

The penguin leader chose to sit by her that evening. It squeaked at her, as though in approval.  
那晚，企鹅首领选择坐在她旁边。它对她发出吱吱声，仿佛在表示赞同。

---

"Heads up!" “小心！”

The pack of batteries flew through the air and landed safely in Shinji's hands, followed by two packs of rations.  
一包电池飞过空中，稳稳落入真嗣手中，紧接着是两包口粮。

Kensuke smirked at how quickly they were caught. _Faster reflexes, gets up earlier than I do nowadays, keeps soldering on at the fields, the center and his fishing station. Didn't have the energy to move or eat when he arrived, and now he's tireless. How about that, Shikinami?_  
“健介得意地笑了，他们接得真快。反应更快了，比我起得早，还在田里、中心和他的钓鱼点坚持不懈。刚来时连动弹或吃饭的力气都没有，现在却不知疲倦。怎么样，式波？”

"Thanks, Kensuke!" Shinji jogged back to the house and loaded another sack of seeds on the Suzuki. "How'd you know?"  
"谢谢你，真嗣！" 真嗣小跑回屋，又往铃木车上装了一袋种子。"你怎么知道的？"

"I didn't," he admitted with ease, stealing a glance at the door to ensure no redhead was glowering at him. "The Major demanded I pass the package along. Wouldn't want to get her madder."  
"其实我不知道，" 他轻松地承认，偷偷瞥了一眼门口，确保没有红发女孩在瞪着他。"少校命令我把包裹转交给你。可不想惹她更生气。"

"Is she still not talking to you?"  
"她还在生你的气吗？"

The question brought about a few barks of laughter as they climbed into the car. "Nope. Not a word out of the absolute necessary, anyway."  
这个问题引来了几声笑声，他们爬进车里。“没有。反正除了绝对必要的，一个字也没说。”

"If you don't mind me asking, why is she angry with you?" Shinji inquired. The engine coughed its way into life, and the car started traversing the uneven road. "I mean, everybody got drunk at that party. Even Viko was swaying side to side when I left."  
“如果你不介意我问的话，她为什么生你的气？”真嗣问道。引擎咕噜咕噜地启动了，车子开始在崎岖的路上行驶。“我是说，那场派对上大家都喝醉了。就连维科离开时也是摇摇晃晃的。”

_Because the cups, the kitchen, and utensils you crafted for her with your bare hands were broken, because I allowed the little haven you three built be tarnished. But mainly, because you got hurt.  
因为你亲手为她制作的杯子、厨房和餐具都碎了，因为我让你们三人建造的小小避风港蒙上了污点。但主要是因为你受伤了。_

"To be fair, I'm responsible for each member of this village, which obviously includes you," Kensuke explained. The skies outside the barrier kept getting darker. "It was my duty to debrief the sailors and keep them on their best behavior. This isn't the first time one of them gets out of control."  
“公平地说，我负责这个村子的每一位成员，显然包括你在内，”健介解释道。屏障外的天空越来越暗。“我的职责是向水手们汇报情况并确保他们行为端正。这不是他们第一次失控了。”

_Come on, bite. Just a little white lie, Shinji. Just take it and move along,_ he thought with desperation.  
“来吧，咬一口。就一个小小的白色谎言，真嗣。接受它，然后继续前进，”他绝望地想着。

"So, have other members of the Wunder come looking for me before?"  
“那么，之前有 Wunder 号的其他人来找过我吗？”

_God damn it!  该死的！_

"What? No," he lied. Two others had been dealt with days before the party, only Viko had been the one to 'educate' them. "I mean other sailors who get blackout drunk the moment they set foot on land. They start roughhousing, and sometimes it's escalated to full blown altercations."  
“什么？不，”他撒谎道。在派对前几天，已经有另外两人被处理掉了，只有维科是负责‘教育’他们的。“我是说那些一上岸就喝得烂醉如泥的水手。他们开始胡闹，有时甚至会升级为激烈的冲突。”

"Oh," Shinji nodded, appeased with the response. "Nothing really bad happened, though. I don't get why she won't talk to you."  
“哦，”真嗣点点头，对这个回答感到满意。“不过，其实也没发生什么严重的事。我不明白她为什么不愿意跟你说话。”

Kensuke exhaled in relief. "Maybe she'll consider acknowledging my existence once that bruise above your forehead heals," he said. "She checked it before we left, didn't she?"  
健介松了一口气。“也许等你额头上的淤青消了，她会考虑承认我的存在，”他说。“我们离开前她检查过，不是吗？”

The way Shinji's face turned bright red was all the proof he needed. Not much else was said as they drove to one of the pillars. Three more Wanderers had slogged their way to the barrier in the past few days. Added to the changing weather and recent altercations, the signs kept spiking Kensuke's nerves.  
真嗣的脸变得通红，这已经足够证明一切。他们开车前往其中一个支柱，一路上没再多说什么。过去几天里，又有三名流浪者艰难地抵达了屏障。加上不断变化的天气和最近的冲突，这些迹象不断刺激着健介的神经。

Many of the workers ran up to greet them. They passed down whatever seeds their families had been able to collect, voiced out their own concerns and explained the most recent system failure with the L-barrier.  
许多工人跑来迎接他们。他们递上各自家庭收集的种子，表达自己的担忧，并解释了 L 屏障最近出现的系统故障。

"Say, Shinji, that little sweet you added to lunch yesterday morning?" one of the larger ones said. "Freaking tremendous. Loved it."  
"我说，真嗣，昨天早上你加在午餐里的那个小甜点？简直太棒了。超喜欢。"

"Yeah!" another one chimed in, smacking the boy in the back. "I saw you added that spice to my portion! Did the wife tell you to do that?"  
"是啊！"另一个附和道，拍了拍男孩的背。"我看到你给我的那份加了那种香料！是老婆让你这么做的吗？"

"Uhm, not really," Shinji replied. Kensuke suppressed the urge to laugh at how uncomfortable he looked. "Well, no. She did, but she told me not to tell you. I'm sorry."  
"呃，不完全是，"真嗣回答。健介忍住了笑，看他那副局促不安的样子。"嗯，不是。是她让我做的，但她让我别告诉你。对不起。"

"Hah! Knew it!" "哈！我就知道！"

"So, what's the restaurant's name gonna be?" asked a third worker. "There's a wagon close to the station, pretty sturdy. We can turn it into a kitchen station, it'll be our own little Village 3 bistro!"  
"那么，餐厅的名字打算叫什么？" 第三位工人问道。"车站附近有辆马车，挺结实的。我们可以把它改造成厨房站，成为我们自己的小村庄 3 小酒馆！"

_They're not even kidding. I've seen their 'schematics' for that wagon,_ Kensuke thought. Behind him, Shinji tried and failed to provide a coherent response, so the suggestions started flowing once Ryoji spoke out.  
他们可不是在开玩笑。我见过他们为那辆马车画的'草图'，健介心想。在他身后，真嗣试图给出一个连贯的回答，但未能成功，于是当亮司开口后，建议便开始源源不断地涌现。

"He probably wants to name it 'The Crimson Countess' or something like that."  
"他大概想把它命名为‘深红伯爵夫人’之类的吧。"

Laughter echoed through the work station and filtered out the barrier. To him, every bit of joy felt like a challenge to the Wanderers, a cry of rebellion against desolation and oblivion. Once he was at a considerable distance, Kensuke took out the old camera and started recording.  
笑声在工作站内回荡，穿透了屏障。对他来说，每一丝欢乐都像是对流浪者们的挑战，是对荒凉与遗忘的反抗之声。当他走远后，健介掏出那台旧相机，开始录制。

Major's Delight, The Golden Mane, Pirate's House and Shikinami Station were some of the most memorable suggestions, all of which had Shinji mumbling nonsense, looking down and trying to conceal how much he liked a certain Second Child.  
‘少校的喜悦’、‘金色鬃毛’、‘海盗之家’和‘式波站’是一些最令人难忘的提议，所有这些都让真嗣嘟囔着胡言乱语，低头试图掩饰他对某位二号机驾驶员的喜爱。

_It's an important day for mankind, after all. Here we stand, against all odds.  
毕竟，这是人类的重要日子。尽管困难重重，我们依然站在这里。_

Every seed counted, every moment of bliss and normalcy was a precious gift to be recorded and collected. The villagers welcomed Shinji into their own little work posts, told him of their duties and families, and basically demanded he meet them all at some point. The greatest victory against Gendo Ikari had long since been conquered.  
每一粒种子都至关重要，每一个幸福与平凡的时刻都是珍贵的礼物，值得记录和珍藏。村民们热情地邀请真嗣加入他们的工作岗位，向他介绍各自的职责和家庭，并几乎要求他找个时间一一拜访。对碇源堂的最终胜利早已被征服。

"It's like you said to Viko, old man," Kensuke whispered to the camera. "Little by little, step by step. That boy, with fourteen years of age, is the head chef, fisherman and soon-to-be master craftsman of Village 3. Who the hell is this 'Third Child' everyone speaks of? Here, we only know him as Shinji."  
“就像你之前对维科说的，老头，”健介对着镜头低声说道，“一点一点，一步一步。那个十四岁的男孩，是第三村的厨师长、渔夫，即将成为工艺大师。大家口中的‘第三适格者’是谁？在这里，我们只知道他是真嗣。”

---

"Stupid Third." "愚蠢的第三适格者。"

The words felt like bile in her mouth. She tried in vain to focus on the anger from long before, on the memory of the battle, on the pain of being torn apart by Unit 01. Fourteen years of living in a box with people staring at her like she was a monster. Fourteen years of carrying a necklace, a shock collar like she was a dog.  
这些话在她口中如同胆汁般苦涩。她徒劳地试图集中于久远的愤怒，回忆起那场战斗，感受被初号机撕裂的痛苦。十四年，生活在箱子里，人们像看怪物一样盯着她。十四年，佩戴着那条项链，一个像狗一样的电击项圈。

"Little brat. Crybaby. Third Child."  
"小鬼。爱哭鬼。第三适格者。"

Something cold and moist pressed against Asuka's leg, causing her to almost kick the penguin leader as it huddled close to her. _Ugh, I've heard Four-Eyes say birds can get enamored with Lilin, but this is ridiculous,_ the Major barked. She rarely said anything as of late. _I don't even like you lot._  
有什么冰凉而潮湿的东西贴上了明日香的大腿，她差点一脚踢开那只紧挨着她的企鹅头领。呃，我听四眼说过鸟类会对人类产生好感，但这太离谱了，少校咆哮道。她最近很少说话。我甚至不喜欢你们这些家伙。

"Liar," she tried. Still, it rang hollow and stale. "Brat. Useless coward."  
“骗子，”她试图反驳。然而，这番话听起来空洞而陈旧。“小鬼。没用的懦夫。”

The penguin shrilled and ruffled its wet feathers. Asuka groaned, then pointlessly moved the box a few feet away. She set the line back into the water, glaring at the bird as it waddled to her. Its company worsened the self-consciousness of fishing alone around the ruins. More of the cooking station had been repaired that morning, which had forced her to wear something other than the plugsuit to keep the stains away.  
企鹅尖叫着抖动它湿漉漉的羽毛。明日香叹了口气，然后无用地将箱子挪开了几英尺。她重新把线投入水中，瞪着那只蹒跚走向她的鸟。独自一人在废墟间钓鱼，这只企鹅的陪伴让她更加感到不自在。那天早上，更多的烹饪站得到了修复，这迫使她不得不换下驾驶服，以免沾上污渍。

"This is such a waste," Asuka muttered. "What am I doing?"  
"这真是浪费，" 明日香喃喃自语。"我到底在干什么？"

After weeks, the question continued to plague her, unanswered. The sensation of a hand caressing her head returned. _As if fixing the dumb little kitchen means anything. It's just a way to kill time. Yeah, that's all it is. The game finally got boring. After fourteen years, it got boring. Yeah._  
几周过去了，这个问题依旧困扰着她，没有答案。那种被手轻抚头的感觉再次袭来。仿佛修理那个破旧的小厨房有什么意义似的。不过是一种消磨时间的方式罢了。没错，仅此而已。那个游戏终于变得无聊了。十四年后，它变得无聊了。是啊。

"Brat." The penguin turned to her, visibly annoyed. "What?"  
"小鬼。" 企鹅转向她，明显不悦。"什么？"

_Doesn't feel right for you either, does it,_ she mused. _Heh, fourteen years of hate down the drain with a month of playing house. And now, I'm back to square one, fighting these inefficient emotions again and again. All because of what? Some head pats and a few bentos? How hopelessly weak you are, Asuka._  
对你来说也不对劲，是吧，她沉思着。呵呵，十四年的仇恨因为一个月的过家家就付诸东流。现在，我又回到了原点，一遍遍地与这些无用的情感斗争。这一切都是因为什么？几个摸头和几份便当？你真是无可救药的软弱，明日香。

"_That'll always be enough."_ Shinji countered in her memory.  
“那永远都足够了。”在她的记忆中，真嗣反驳道。

"Heh," she let out a dry chuckle. "Idiot."  
“呵呵，”她发出一声干笑，“傻瓜。”

No protest from the penguin, no aftertaste of ashes and bile. Again, Asuka tried to focus on the memories of endless nights without sleep. The memories of the last few nights welcomed her instead, soothing the sting of more than two decades of solitude.  
企鹅没有抗议，也没有灰烬和胆汁的余味。阿斯卡再次试图专注于那些无眠之夜的记忆。相反，最近几晚的记忆向她敞开怀抱，抚慰了她二十多年孤独的刺痛。

"Shinji." The leader turned to her and squeaked its approval. "Yeah, figured you'd like that one."  
"真嗣。" 领头的转向她，发出赞同的吱吱声。"是啊，我就知道你会喜欢那个。"

"Like what?" A voice rang from behind.  
"喜欢什么？" 一个声音从背后响起。

Asuka rolled her eye. "Nothing, Rei," she growled at the newcomer. "You're here early. Your boyfriend's busy helping at the forge. Then, he'll probably run to his dumb little sapling."  
明日香翻了个白眼。“没什么，绫波，”她对新来的人咆哮道，“你来得真早。你男朋友正忙着在铁匠铺帮忙呢。然后，他大概又会跑去照顾他那棵蠢兮兮的小树苗。”

"You are here early, as well." Rei dragged her own box a reasonable distance from hers and took a seat. "Has there been any luck with fishing thus far?"  
“你也来得很早。”绫波拖着自己的箱子，与她的保持了一段合理距离，然后坐下。“到目前为止，钓鱼有收获吗？”

"None, not with these lazy birds not doing their part," Asuka pointed at the group snoozing close to the ruins. She noticed the slight tremors running up and down Rei's body. "Shouldn't you be conserving energy and all that? I smell river water on you."  
“一点也没有，这些懒鸟不干正事。”明日香指着那群在废墟旁打盹的家伙。她注意到绫波身体微微颤抖。“你不是应该节省体力什么的吗？我闻到你身上有河水的味道。”

"I wanted to plant another row of rice," Rei explained. The girl's relaxed expression irked Asuka for some reason. "Ryoji has gifted me a sapling." She motioned towards the small plant that rested near her backpack. "Perhaps we could find it a home today."  
"我想再种一排稻子，"丽解释道。女孩那副轻松的表情不知为何让明日香感到不快。"亮司送了我一株树苗。"她指了指放在背包旁边的小植物。"也许我们今天可以为它找个家。"

"Whatever." Her eye drifted to the clay. "The idiot's set a few buckets to collect rainwater. Pottery wheel's at the forge, though."  
"随便吧。"她的目光飘向了陶土。"那傻瓜放了几个桶来接雨水。陶轮在熔炉那边。"

"Yes, I visited Mr. Koga's station yesterday." Rei pointed to the dark stains on her coat. "Relative success was achieved with two cups, as per his feedback."  
"是的，我昨天去了古贺先生的工位。"丽指着外套上的深色污渍说。"根据他的反馈，两个杯子做得还算成功。"

"Two whole cups? Good for you." Asuka tried to add some bite to her tone, which only made the attempt more obviously forced. "You said you wanted to help with the idiot's little kitchen, didn't you? Have at it."  
"两整杯？不错嘛。" 明日香试图在语气中加入一些尖锐，但这只让她的尝试显得更加明显地勉强。"你不是说想帮那个白痴的小厨房吗？那就去吧。"

"May I sit here for a bit, first?" Rei inquired. "Your company is pleasant, Pilot Shikinami."  
"我可以先在这里坐一会儿吗？" 绫波问道。"你的陪伴很愉快，式波二号。"

"You'd be about the second or third person ever to think that." Asuka said. "You're not so terrible to be around, either."  
"你会是第二个或第三个这么想的人。" 明日香说。"你也不那么糟糕，相处起来还不错。"

"Oh? Then I am glad." Rei gave her a shaky smile. "Do you think he will notice?"  
“哦？那我真高兴。”丽向她露出了一个颤抖的微笑，“你觉得他会注意到吗？”

The syringe she kept for the pain in her eye rested on her jacket pocket. Along with the binding agent keeping the restraint within her skull in place, it dulled the pain whenever her unfriendly little parasite decided to have a hissy fit. She stabbed the tip into Rei's arm without warning, and saw the liquid that so many times had eased her own existence disappear.  
她用来缓解眼睛疼痛的注射器放在夹克口袋里。与固定在她头骨内的束缚装置的结合剂一起，每当她那不友好的小寄生虫决定发脾气时，它都能减轻疼痛。她没有预警地将针尖刺入丽的胳膊，看着那曾经多次缓解她自身痛苦的液体消失。

Rei's body relaxed in seconds, swaying on the box before Asuka caught her shoulder. Her pale skin, cold to the touch, slowly warmed to a normal temperature.  
几秒钟内，丽的身体放松下来，在箱子上摇晃，直到明日香抓住她的肩膀。她苍白冰凉的皮肤慢慢恢复到正常温度。

"Not anymore, he won't," Asuka replied. "It won't last forever. He's not as stupid as he looks. Last night he asked me about the shaking of your hands. It'd be easier if you just told him."  
"不会再这样了，他不会了，"明日香回答道。"这不会永远持续下去。他不像看起来那么傻。昨晚他问我你手抖的事。你直接告诉他可能会更容易些。"

She rolled her eye when Rei vehemently shook her head. "I do not wish for these moments to be tarnished," the girl said. "There is not much time left. Every second counts."  
她翻了个白眼，当绫波坚决地摇头时。"我不希望这些时刻被破坏，"女孩说。"剩下的时间不多了。每一秒都很重要。"

"Keh, now you're just sounding like that tree-hugging goofball." Asuka went back to her seat and picked up the fishing rod from the ground. "Suppose whether you tell him or not makes no real difference."  
"哼，现在你听起来就像那个抱树的傻瓜。"明日香回到座位上，从地上拿起钓竿。"想想看，你告不告诉他其实也没什么区别。"

"Indeed," Rei's gaze drifted to the cooking station. "I wish to see the boy I like smile and be happy. That is enough. It shall always be enough."  
“确实，”丽的眼神飘向烹饪台，“我希望看到我喜欢的那个人微笑并感到快乐。这就足够了。永远都会是足够的。”

With her hands under control and body not quaking with every gush of wind, she set about moistening the clay with collected rainwater. Asuka scowled at the ocean, sparing the occasional glance at the way Rei gingerly covered the broken surfaces with fresh material.  
双手稳住，身体不再因每一阵风而颤抖，她开始用收集的雨水湿润泥土。明日香对着大海皱眉，不时瞥向丽小心翼翼地用新鲜材料覆盖破损表面的方式。

_Always be enough, huh. For you lot, maybe. You don't really know anything, though. Neither of you._ Asuka's gaze turned bitter. _Damn it, stop. Don't think about that. Don't waste time in nonsense._  
永远足够，是吧。对你们这些人来说，或许吧。但你们其实什么都不懂。你们俩都不懂。明日香的目光变得苦涩。该死，停下。别想那些了。别在无谓的事情上浪费时间。

Regardless of how hard she fought against it, Asuka's mind drifted. If even the slightest victory was achieved, perhaps both Shinji and Ryoji could return to the ruins. Newcomers would sit by them, fish and enjoy each other's company. Her hands wrung around the handle. What if she had a chance? What if she survived? What if she fought to the end, and somehow did not die?  
无论她如何努力抵抗，明日香的思绪还是飘散了。哪怕只取得最微小的胜利，也许真嗣和凌二都能回到废墟。新来的人们会坐在他们身边，一起钓鱼，享受彼此的陪伴。她的双手紧紧握住把手。如果她有机会呢？如果她能幸存呢？如果她拼尽全力，却奇迹般地没有死去呢？

_Stop. It's nonsense.  停下。这简直是胡言乱语。_

The villagers around Ryoji's melon field had treated her just as they treated Shinji. They gave her space, but did not cower in fear. Nobody stared at her like she was a freak. She had almost fallen asleep. She had almost dreamed.  
凌二瓜田周围的村民对待她的方式和对待真嗣一样。他们给她空间，但并不畏惧。没有人像看怪物一样盯着她。她几乎要睡着了。她几乎要梦见了。

_Shut up. So what, I'm supposed to hope for victory now? Dream of sitting here, fishing as the afternoon drones on and Ayanami fumbles about. Going to see the dumb little plants by that brat's field. Sounds boring. Absolutely… completely boring.  
闭嘴。那又怎样，我现在就该期待胜利吗？梦想着坐在这里，钓鱼度过漫长的下午，看着绫波笨手笨脚地忙活。还要去看那小鬼田里的傻乎乎的小植物。听起来真无聊。绝对……完全无聊透顶。_

Her shoulders loosened as hurried footsteps echoed through the walls.  
她的肩膀随着急促的脚步声在墙内回响而放松下来。

"Oh!" Shinji stopped a few feet away from her. "Asuka? What… It's sort of early," he said, pointing to the fishing rod. "Usually they start biting a little after three or four."  
“哦！”真嗣在离她几英尺远的地方停下。“明日香？怎么……现在有点早，”他指着钓竿说。“通常三点或四点后它们才开始咬钩。”

"So?" she fixed him with a light glare. He did not recoil from it. "I was bored. Do we need to ask the Mighty Fisherman for permission to come here, now?"  
"那又怎样？" 她用轻蔑的目光盯着他。他没有退缩。"我只是觉得无聊。难道我们现在来这里还需要向伟大的渔夫请示吗？"

"Okay, geez," Shinji laughed off her statement. Even Rei had the gall to giggle behind them. "Hi, Rei! I heard you planted another row this morning!"  
"好吧，天哪，" 真嗣笑着回应她的话。就连丽也忍不住在他们背后偷笑。"嗨，丽！我听说你今天早上又种了一排！"

"Thank you," Rei stammered back. "The field is now at full capacity."  
"谢谢，" 丽结巴着回答。"现在田地已经满负荷了。"

Shinji crouched beside her, and in little over an hour the station was fully repaired. The sound of his voice soothed her senses further. Weariness settled again, as though whatever human cells remained in her body desperately screamed for rest.  
真嗣蹲在她旁边，不到一个小时车站就完全修复了。他的声音让她的感官更加平静。疲惫再次袭来，仿佛她体内残存的人类细胞在拼命呼唤休息。

"Hey," he said once his own line was in the water. "Are you hungry? Rei made some onigiri, and I sneaked out a bit of stew from the ration center."  
“嘿，”他把自己的钓线放入水中后说道，“你饿了吗？绫波做了些饭团，我从补给中心偷了点炖菜。”

"Starving, actually," she replied, and stifled a yawn. "Did she put sesame seeds on those onigiri?"  
“其实饿坏了，”她回答道，并忍住了一个哈欠。“她在饭团上放芝麻了吗？”

"I did not," Rei said. "I am aware you dislike them."  
"我没有，" 丽说。"我知道你不喜欢它们。"

Familiarity. Comfort. A place to return to, not just a place she protected. The horrible seed she had been avoiding took root within Asuka's soul. A desire to win. Hope began to blossom, to her displeasure.  
熟悉感。舒适感。一个可以回归的地方，不仅仅是她守护的地方。她一直避免的可怕种子在明日香的灵魂中生根了。一种渴望胜利的欲望。希望开始绽放，尽管她并不乐意。

"Heh." "呵呵。"

---

Carefree laughter faded away, as the taste of food or need of water once had.  
无忧无虑的笑声渐渐消逝，如同食物的味道或对水的需求曾经那样。

Memories were harder to access. They remained at hand if pressed enough, only foggy. The events which had led to him standing before the mighty behemoth were engulfed in a mist. He felt nothing. No joy, no sadness, no anticipation or despair.  
记忆变得更加难以触及。如果足够努力，它们仍近在咫尺，只是模糊不清。导致他站在那庞大怪物面前的事件被迷雾笼罩。他感受不到任何情绪。没有喜悦，没有悲伤，没有期待或绝望。

Only the scenario remained.  
只有场景依旧。

"Wait for me, Yui," Gendo Ikari said to the Evangelion. Unit 01 was far, but when had distance ever bothered him? "The moment we have worked so long for is at hand."  
"等等我，唯，" 碇源堂对 EVA 初号机说道。初号机远在天边，但距离何时曾困扰过他？"我们为之奋斗许久的时刻即将到来。"

"Did it truly have to come to this?"  
"真的必须走到这一步吗？"

Fuyutsuki's footsteps distracted his train of thought. Once, as a human, the old man's thoughts and opinions had meant something. Never enough to sway him from a decision, however. A thousand scenarios were revised daily in his head, a thousand times he arrived at the same place.  
冬月的脚步打断了他的思绪。曾经，作为一个人类，这位老人的想法和意见还有些分量。然而，从未足以动摇他的决定。他每日在脑海中修订千百种情景，千百次他都得出同样的结论。

"This is the only way." Gendo declared. "The old men are sufficiently content with the result. After everything is complete, humanity will know no pain, no sorrow."  
"这是唯一的方法。" 碇源堂宣称。"那些老人们对这个结果已经相当满意。一切完成后，人类将不再有痛苦，不再有悲伤。"

"Humanity will be no more," the old man rebuked. "But you will be with Yui. In the end, that is all that matters, no?"  
"人类将不复存在，" 老人反驳道。"但你将与唯在一起。最终，那才是最重要的，不是吗？"

"Correct." "没错。"

It had been years since the professor stood anywhere close to him. The change had started after Gendo had first assimilated the Angel's core, and broadened with time. Usually some snide remark or ominous, vague statement would be the end of their interaction. That day was different.  
教授已经多年未曾靠近过他。这一切变化始于源堂首次融合使徒的核心之后，随着时间推移愈发明显。通常他们的交流会以一些尖酸刻薄的话语或不祥的模糊言论告终。但那天却截然不同。

"Years without rest, fleeing from your own mortality, and yet the most obvious thought has eluded you," he told Gendo. "Your wish may not be her wish."  
“多年来无休止地逃避自身的死亡，你却忽略了最显而易见的想法，”他对源堂说，“你的愿望未必是她的愿望。”

The gate closed, and he was alone with the souls residing within Unit 13.  
大门关闭，他独自与十三号机内的灵魂们共处。

One had once been talkative and curious, lacking in malice. An innocent child, raised to the slaughter like his daughters, like his son. It was best to keep them in the dark, feed them not a drop of affection and not bother filling their heads with false hope. He was a coward, all he could do was hurt and maim and take. Even as he used them for his benefit, they were better off not knowing the monster who had spawned them.  
曾经，他健谈而好奇，心无恶意。一个天真无邪的孩子，如同他的女儿们，如同他的儿子，被养育至屠杀的命运。最好让他们蒙在鼓里，不给予一丝温情，也不费心用虚假的希望填满他们的头脑。他是个懦夫，所能做的只是伤害、残害和夺取。即便利用他们为自己谋利，他们也最好不知道那个生下他们的怪物。

Giggles rippled through the armor and into his mind. The second was eager, inquisitive and devious, even glad for the chance to devour, to seek completion. It was best to keep its desires and pulses caged. The fire within that soul was dangerous if not kept at bay. Their shared interest was a blessing. She would obtain completion with the last of the Shikinami series, and he would see his Yui at last.  
笑声穿透盔甲，传入他的脑海。第二个是热切的、好奇的、狡猾的，甚至为有机会吞噬、寻求完整而感到高兴。最好将其欲望和冲动囚禁。那灵魂中的火焰若不加以遏制，是危险的。他们共同的兴趣是一种祝福。她将通过最后一位式波系列获得完整，而他将终于见到他的唯。

_I will become God,_ the words rang though his brain again. _Then I will not lose anything ever again._  
我将成神，这句话再次在他的脑海中回响。那样我就再也不会失去任何东西了。

"_Your wish may not be her wish."_  
"你的愿望未必是她的愿望。"

For once in over fourteen years, Gendo's gut constricted. Yui had always loved their son more than anything in the world. The boy was weak, surely too broken to move, if he was alive at all. All he needed was Unit 01, Shinji was no longer of any use. With the power surely to be at hand, the boy's existence was irrelevant.  
在超过十四年的时间里，源渡的内心首次紧缩。唯一直深爱着他们的儿子，胜过世间一切。那孩子脆弱不堪，若还活着，定是动弹不得。他需要的只是初号机，真嗣已毫无用处。只要力量在手，那孩子的存在便无关紧要。

"Once we are together, I can bring him along if that is your wish," Gendo elaborated. From afar, he felt the core of Unit 01 come alive. "Wait for me, Yui."  
"一旦我们团聚，若那是你的愿望，我可以带上他。" 源渡进一步解释道。从远处，他感受到初号机的核心开始苏醒。"等我，唯。"

The phrase would strengthen his resolve on days where it had once faltered. They felt empty now, just like his chest and soul. It was a shame he was too far gone to notice.  
这句话会在他曾经动摇的日子里坚定他的决心。现在它们感觉空洞，就像他的胸膛和灵魂一样。遗憾的是，他已经走得太远，无法察觉到这一点。

"…yeah, I've heard it. Hard not to."  
“……是啊，我听过。很难不听到。”

"Told you. They're jumping with joy because that brat stopped trying to starve himself. Imagine if he tries to get back in the ship. Imagine if he feels like piloting again."  
“告诉你了吧。他们高兴得跳起来，因为那小子终于不再试图饿死自己了。想象一下，如果他试图重新回到船上。想象一下，如果他又想再次驾驶。”

Mari stopped mid-stride. Her eyes narrowed at the voices that echoed from the halls. She hid behind a corner and flattened against the metal wall. The footfalls halted. Three or four, if she had to guess. She recognized the first two as some of the older crewmen, a mechanic and a pilot.  
玛丽突然停下脚步。她的目光紧盯着从走廊传来的声音。她躲在一个角落里，紧贴着金属墙壁。脚步声停了下来。她猜测有三四个人的样子。她认出了前两个声音，是一些老船员，一个机械师和一个飞行员。

"Eh, doesn't matter," A third, familiar and feminine voice added. They whispered amongst one another, and from her viewpoint Mari could see them turn their heads every few seconds. "All that news about the village is best thing that could've happened to us," she said. "Especially those details about Pilot Shikinami."  
“哎，无所谓了，”一个熟悉而女性化的声音补充道。他们互相低声交谈着，从玛丽的视角可以看到他们每隔几秒就转头查看四周。“关于那个村庄的新闻对我们来说是最好的事情，”她说，“尤其是关于式波·明日香的那些细节。”

"Who would've thought she'd turn on us, her of all people," the mechanic grumbled. "Prancing around that walking apocalypse, pretending she doesn't hate him as much as us."  
“谁会想到她会背叛我们，她可是我们中的一员，”机械师抱怨道。“在那个人形灾难面前蹦跶，假装她不恨他，和我们一样。”

"Captain's getting cold feet, too," the smallest one mumbled. "She fed us that 'by whatever means necessary' bullshit for years, and now she hesitates."  
"舰长也开始犹豫不决了，"最矮的那个咕哝道。"她多年来一直用'不惜一切手段'这种屁话来糊弄我们，现在却迟疑了。"

"Won't matter much after we get control of the deck," said the woman. "Akagi hacked the self-destruct system of Unit 01. A little more work, and we'll be able to activate it remotely. You know what that means, right? Goodbye to all this nightmare once and for all."  
"一旦我们控制了甲板，这些都不重要了，"女人说道。"赤城已经破解了 01 号单元的自毁系统。再稍微努力一下，我们就能远程激活它。你知道这意味着什么，对吧？终于可以永远告别这场噩梦了。"

"Yeah. A blue sky and green trees, at last."  
"是啊。终于能看到蓝天和绿树了。"

"First, we need to get a hold of that DSS device, though. A single Eva's enough to stop the plan dead in its tracks."  
首先，我们得拿到那个 DSS 装置。一个 Eva 就足以让整个计划彻底泡汤。

_Throw a little blood in the water and watch the sharks approach,_ Mari thought. Ritsuko's strategy had worked marvelously. The idea of detonating the Evangelions along with the ship in a last-ditch effort to destroy Ikari's fortress, or at least derail his plans had been widely embraced.  
玛丽心想，撒点血进水里，看看鲨鱼会不会靠近。律子的策略效果惊人。引爆 Eva 和飞船，作为最后一搏摧毁碇的堡垒，或者至少打乱他的计划，这一想法得到了广泛支持。

Many crew members clamored that Shinji's collar be triggered along with Unit 01.  
许多船员纷纷要求同时触发真嗣和 01 号的项圈。

_Not on our watch, that's for sure. Isn't that right, Princess?_ Mari quietly moved back to her quarters, memorizing the faces of the trio of mutineers. The female did herself no favors with such a unique hair color. _Why does everybody always try to make things difficult? They say they're adults, but they behave like four-year-olds._  
绝不会在我们眼皮底下发生，这是肯定的。对吧，公主？玛丽悄悄地回到自己的房间，记住了那三个叛变者的面孔。那个女人用这样独特的头发颜色，对自己可没什么好处。为什么每个人都总是试图把事情搞复杂？他们自称是成年人，但行为却像四岁的孩子。

She picked up the boring novel from before and re-read the ending, which was at least somewhat cathartic despite the poor writing quality. The deckhand walked by her cage and ducked away once she fixed him with a playful smile.  
她拿起之前那本乏味的小说，重新读了一遍结局，尽管文笔不佳，但至少有些宣泄感。船员从她的笼子旁走过，一看到她带着调皮的微笑盯着他，便迅速躲开了。

"Run along, little weasel," Mari snickered, turning the page. "Hide in your burrow like the coward you are. To think the dear professor calls _me_ Iscariot. How ironic."  
“快跑吧，小鼬鼠，”玛丽嗤笑一声，翻过一页。“像你这胆小鬼一样躲进你的洞里。想想那位亲爱的教授称我为犹大，多么讽刺。”

One advantage of having lived for so long was the knowledge of old technology, old means of exchanging information otherwise untraceable through electronics. She scribbled a note in a tiny piece of paper with even smaller letters. To the blind eye, it was nothing but badly written lyrics of a song. The tiny paper was crumpled into a ball as though it was trash, and stuffed in an old matchbox.  
长久以来生活的一大优势便是对旧技术的了解，那些通过电子手段无法追踪的信息交换方式。她在一张小纸片上用更小的字母匆匆写下一张便条。在不经意的目光下，这不过是首歌的拙劣歌词。小纸片被揉成一团，仿佛是垃圾一般，塞进了一个旧火柴盒里。

"With those three, that makes about fifty-seven. Not really great numbers." Mari exited the cage and pretended to inspect her Eva, and left the small package in one of the smaller crevices. "Oh, well. Not like it'll make any difference."  
“加上这三个，总共大约五十七个。不算太好的数字。”玛丽走出笼子，假装检查她的 Eva，并将小包裹留在其中一个较小的缝隙中。“哦，好吧。反正也不会有什么差别。”

The atmosphere in the fleet was strained. More than half of the crew had opted to stay in the village, which left the Wunder with the absolute necessary numbers to keep the ships operational and ready for battle. After hiding two other boxes, Mari made her way to the chamber where Unit 01 was contained.  
舰队中的气氛紧张。超过半数的船员选择留在村庄，这使得 Wunder 号只剩下维持船只运行和备战所需的最低人数。在藏好另外两个盒子后，玛丽前往了存放 01 机体的舱室。

"It's certainly been a while, old friend," she whispered. No response, not that she expected one. "Excited to see your Puppy again? I know I am!"  
"真是久违了，老朋友，"她低声说道。没有回应，不过她也没指望有。"见到你的小狗再次兴奋吗？我可是很期待呢！"

---

"Twenty-seven… twenty-eight," Shinji paused, and fixed Viko with a worried glance. "No new leaves for a while. Is that normal?"  
"二十七……二十八，"真嗣停顿了一下，担忧地看向维科。"已经有一段时间没有新叶了。这正常吗？"

Viko's laughter did nothing for his unease. "Absolutely!" He exclaimed. "It's grown about four centimeters in the past few days, in case you didn't notice."  
维科的笑声并未缓解他的不安。"绝对正常！"他大声说道。"这几天它已经长了四厘米，你没注意到吗？"

_I'll have to take his word for it. Is it getting enough sunlight? Too much, maybe? Maybe a bit more water. Weather's been weird the past few days. Should I just build a small roof to protec-  
我只能相信他的话了。它得到足够的阳光了吗？或许太多了？也许需要多浇点水。最近天气很反常。我是不是该搭个小棚子来保护——_

"Stop that," Viko reprimanded. The man's knuckles playfully impacted on top of Shinji's skull. He pointed to one of the smaller trees. "Too much attention is also detrimental to growth. 'Does it need more water? More sunlight? Less? More fertilizer? I'll just add them all preemptively tocover my bases.' Things grow at their own pace, Shinji."  
“别这样，”Viko 责备道。那人的指节开玩笑地敲在 Shinji 的头顶。他指向其中一棵较小的树。“过多的关注同样不利于成长。‘它需要更多的水吗？更多的阳光？更少？更多肥料？我干脆提前都加上以防万一。’事物自有其生长节奏，Shinji。”

Sighing in defeat, Shinji washed his hands in the stream and collapsed next to Viko. "Why does it feel like every time you say something, you're not really talking about whatever it is we're talking about?"  
叹了口气，Shinji 在溪流中洗净双手，然后瘫倒在 Viko 旁边。“为什么每次你说话，都感觉你不是在谈论我们正在讨论的事情？”

"Hmm? What do you mean?"  
"嗯？你什么意思？"

"It just feels like you're… trying to teach me something," he clarified. "Did your brother do that with you a lot?"  
"感觉你好像……在教我什么，"他解释道。"你哥哥以前也经常这样对你吗？"

"All the damn time," Viko admitted, laughing. "What's worse, his special little 'brand' of wisdom came shrouded in foul language and derisive banter more often than not."  
"无时无刻，"维科承认道，笑了起来。"更糟糕的是，他那独特的'智慧'往往包裹在粗话和嘲讽之中，多半如此。"

"So, sort of like you, but rude?" More laughter, loud enough to alert the birds above. "Am I being annoying?" Shinji asked next. "Around Asuka, I mean. I wouldn't want to… uhm… make her uncomfortable."  
"所以，有点像你，但更粗鲁？" 笑声再次响起，响亮到足以惊动上方的鸟儿。"我是不是很烦人？" 真嗣接着问。"我是说在明日香面前。我不想……呃……让她不舒服。"

"Nah, you're fine. She'd be the first to tell you if that were the case." Viko handed him a fresh bottle of lemonade. "I get it, you're excited. And you're worried that you'll mess it up. It's all perfectly normal."  
"不，你没事的。如果真是那样，她会第一个告诉你的。" 维克递给他一瓶新鲜的柠檬水。"我明白，你很兴奋。而且你担心会把事情搞砸。这都是很正常的。"

"Kensuke told me something like that," added Shinji. The anxiousness receded a bit after a drink of the cold beverage. "I think I've grown to like this place. Your 'favorite spot'."  
"健介也跟我说过类似的话，" 真嗣补充道。喝了一口冰凉的饮料后，焦虑感稍稍减退了些。"我想我已经喜欢上这个地方了。你的'最爱之地'。"

"Have you?" Viko shot him a knowing glance. "As stated the day we met, it's all yours. The more the merrier! Speaking of which, how come our dearest Major didn't come along? I miss her glaring at me from the shadows."  
"你呢？" Viko 投给他一个心领神会的眼神。"正如我们初次见面时所说，这都是你的。多多益善！说到这个，我们亲爱的少校怎么没来？我可想念她在暗处瞪我的样子了。"

His heartbeat doubled in seconds. Asuka had chosen to stay at the house that evening. _Not that I had much of a choice. She basically shooed me out without any explanation the moment I got back from the rice field. There was wood burning outside, I could smell it. And the cut on her finger, what's up with that?_  
他的心跳在几秒内翻倍。那天晚上，明日香选择留在家里。并非我有多少选择余地。我刚从稻田回来，她几乎没给任何解释就把我赶了出来。外面有木头在燃烧，我能闻到那股味道。还有她手指上的伤口，这是怎么回事？

"She didn't say, but I get the feeling that she was busy." Shinji clarified.  
"她没说，但我感觉她很忙。" 真嗣解释道。

"Busy? With something other than her videogames? Preposterous."  
"忙？除了她的电子游戏之外？荒谬。"

The WonderSwan had been absent that morning as well. The times he saw her playing were scarcer each day. "Believe or not, she hasn't been using it lately."  
那天早上，神奇小子机也不见了踪影。他看到她玩游戏的次数日渐稀少。“信不信由你，她最近都没怎么用它。”

"How intriguing," Viko commented, giving Shinji a smug little smirk. "Something or someone else must be occupying her attention, then. What could that be, I wonder?"  
"真有意思，" Viko 评论道，向 Shinji 投去一个得意的微笑。“那她的注意力一定被别的东西或人占据了。会是什么呢，我很好奇？”

Shinji fidgeted and stared at the ground. Lately, any thoughts regarding a certain redhead dragged with them the recollection of her head against his shoulder, her hair threading through his fingers, her calm, deep breathing.  
真嗣局促不安地盯着地面。最近，每当想到某个红发女孩，脑海中总会浮现她靠在他肩上的画面，她的发丝穿过他的指间，她平静深沉的呼吸。

"Do you think Asuka's pretty?" The question made Viko raise a curious eyebrow, and forced Shinji to slap a hand over his own mouth. "Sorry," he added. "Never mind."  
“你觉得明日香漂亮吗？”这个问题让维科好奇地挑了挑眉，真嗣则不得不捂住自己的嘴。“对不起，”他补充道，“别在意。”

"No need to apologize." Viko glanced at the village, deep in thought. "I don't mean to be rude, but Major Shikinami isn't really my type. Not that she's not beautiful, mind you. So, to answer your question; yes. She's very pretty."  
“不必道歉。”维科若有所思地望向村庄，“无意冒犯，但式波少校并不是我的菜。并不是说她不美，请注意。所以，回答你的问题；是的，她非常漂亮。”

Hearing the words from someone else validated his feelings to an extent. "I like her hair, a-and her eyes."  
听到别人说出同样的话，他的感觉得到了某种程度的证实。“我喜欢她的头发，还有她的眼睛。”

"Most people only ever see the anger in that glare of hers." Viko patted Shinji on the shoulder. "My brother had a similar, albeit much darker look. Nobody bothered to see the sadness underneath, or the joy. There's a… lonely sort of beauty to that, right? This beauty is so quiet and hidden away, though, that most of us can't ever see it."  
“大多数人只看到她那种瞪视中的愤怒。”Viko 拍了拍真嗣的肩膀。“我哥哥也有类似的，尽管更加阴沉的眼神。没人费心去看那下面的悲伤，或是喜悦。有一种……孤独的美，对吧？这种美是如此安静和隐蔽，以至于我们大多数人永远都无法察觉。”

Reading between the snarky lines of what Asuka said came to mind. The way she scowled at the food, or how easily she dismissed any compliment to hide her true reaction. How the tiniest act of kindness from her meant so much more now that he knew of her past.  
他脑海中浮现出从明日香那些尖酸刻薄的话语中读出的深意。她对食物皱眉的方式，或是她如何轻易地无视任何赞美以掩盖真实的反应。现在他知道了她的过去，她最微小的善意举动都意味着更多。

Kensuke had shown him a very rare species of migratory bird the night before. When Shinji questioned why they had wasted the chance to take a picture, Kensuke had only chuckled and allowed him to view the bird with the lens before it flew away.  
前一晚，健介向他展示了一种非常罕见的迁徙鸟类。当真嗣质疑他们为何错过了拍照的机会时，健介只是轻笑一声，让他透过镜头观赏那只鸟，直到它飞走。

"Beautiful things don't ask for attention," Shinji repeated, recalling the many times Asuka disappeared behind a tree or a wall. "That's why they're so hard to find."  
“美好的事物不寻求关注，”真嗣重复道，回想起许多次明日香消失在树后或墙角的情景。“正因为如此，它们才难以寻觅。”

"You have to know how to look, or they'll just scamper away," Viko added. "Heh, old man Aida's favorite line, that was. Now then, regarding your earlier request."  
“你得知道如何去寻找，否则它们只会溜走，”维科补充道，“嘿，这是老阿达最喜欢的台词。那么，关于你之前的请求。”

Shinji's head instantly snapped in the man's direction. "Yeah? Is it… possible?"  
真嗣的头立刻转向那人。“是吗？这……有可能吗？”

"The first one is easy, I have just the thing. The second, however… I'm afraid not." The words made Shinji's shoulders slump, so Viko slapped a calloused hand on his back again. "Give it a few months, depending on the weather, and they might just bloom."  
“第一个简单，我正好有办法。至于第二个嘛……恐怕不行。”这话让真嗣的肩膀耷拉下来，于是维科再次用粗糙的手掌拍了拍他的背。“等上几个月，看天气情况，它们或许就会开花。”

_Oh. I guess I was asking for too much. It's a stupid idea, anyway. She'd probably just throw them in the trash like those letters from school. It's better this way, yeah.  
哦，看来我要求太多了。反正这主意本来就蠢。她大概会把它们像那些学校的信一样扔进垃圾桶吧。这样也好，对吧。_

"Your choice was too cliché, though."  
"你的选择太老套了，不过。"

The gears in Shinji's mind came to an abrupt halt. "Huh?"  
真嗣的思绪突然停顿。“啊？”

Viko got to his feet and dusted off his pants, offering a gloved hand in his direction. "There are more plant species than we will probably ever be able to document. Some are so rare they're only seen or heard from once or twice. Something more… unique… could be the proper course."  
维克站起身，拍了拍裤子上的灰尘，向他伸出了戴着手套的手。“植物种类比我们可能永远能记录的还要多。有些极其稀有，只被发现过一两次。选择一些更……独特的东西……可能是正确的方向。”

"So… there's another option?" Shinji asked, dumbfounded.  
"所以…还有其他选择吗？" 真嗣问道，一脸茫然。

"Funny you should ask! Let me tell you about the exciting world of plant symbolism throughout human history! Very exciting tales of cross-pollination and genetic engineering!"  
"你这么问真有趣！让我来告诉你关于人类历史上植物象征意义的精彩世界吧！充满了异花授粉和基因工程的激动人心的故事！"

_Oh,_ Shinji repressed a groan. "How… exciting." He sighed in defeat_._ "Care to elaborate?"  
哦，真嗣压抑住了一声叹息。 "多么…令人兴奋。" 他无奈地叹了口气。 "愿意详细说说吗？"

---

_No. 不。_

The rice started to burn in the pan. Two of the fillets Hikari provided had already fallen on the seasoning. One of the plates had slipped onto the floor and broken onto pieces, and a glass had been thrown at the wall afterwards.  
锅里的米饭开始烧焦了。光提供的两块鱼片已经掉进了调味料里。一个盘子滑落到地板上，摔成了碎片，随后一个玻璃杯也被扔向了墙壁。

_No, no, no. Wrong, too damn bland. No way this is any good. How would I know, anyway? I can barely even remember what things taste like.  
不，不，不。错了，太他妈淡了。这肯定不行。我怎么知道呢？我几乎都不记得食物是什么味道了。_

"Ugh, why am I wasting my time with this?" Asuka asked the empty house. No reply, not from the Major, not from the walls, not from the parasite. "Acting like a dumb twelve-year-old, and for what? So he can pretend to like it and vomit when I'm not looking?"  
“呃，我为什么要在这上面浪费时间？”明日香对着空荡荡的房子问道。没有回应，无论是来自玛丽，还是墙壁，或是使徒。“像个傻乎乎的十二岁小孩一样，图什么？就为了让他假装喜欢，然后趁我不注意时吐出来？”

Despite the constant reasoning against continuing her task, Asuka refueled the cinders outside and set about trying not to burn the protein. _Stop,_ she ordered the raging pulse thundering in her ears. _I've faced monsters my entire life. I've become the meatsuit for one, as well. You will regain control. You will not fail at this menial task, even if it's pointless._  
尽管内心不断劝说自己放弃这项任务，明日香还是给外面的灰烬加了燃料，并努力不让蛋白质烧焦。停下来，她命令自己耳中轰鸣的脉搏。我一生都在面对怪物。我也曾成为它们的肉身。你会重新掌控局面。你不会在这项微不足道的任务上失败，即使它毫无意义。

"Idiot always makes some sauce or reduction in case the meat doesn't get seasoned," she grumbled at the pans, and took out the wrinkled paper where the recipe and steps were written. "Mix in the butter and stir until emulsified. Ugh, how long is _that_ supposed to take, then?"  
“白痴总是会做些酱汁或浓缩液，以防肉没腌好，”她对着平底锅嘟囔着，然后拿出皱巴巴的纸，上面写着食谱和步骤。“加入黄油并搅拌至乳化。呃，这到底要花多长时间？”

Nothing on the instructions specified a time frame, so the clock in her head was once again rendered useless. Focusing on whether the pan was sufficiently hot, or if the plates were at the table made Asuka forget the perpetual run against time.  
说明书上并未指定时间范围，因此她脑海中的时钟再次变得无用。专注于平底锅是否足够热，或者盘子是否已摆上桌，让明日香忘记了那永无止境的时间竞赛。

"Emulsify, damn you." Asuka ordered. "Come on, how much longer?"  
"给我乳化，该死的。" 明日香命令道。"快点，还要多久？"

Minutes ticked by without her noticing. Between keeping the stove ignited, cooking the meat and making sure the rice did not turn into char took away the Wunder's impending arrival. _How does the idiot look so relaxed while doing this crap? It's infuriating!_  
分钟悄然流逝，她却未曾察觉。在保持炉火不灭、烹饪肉类和确保米饭不烧焦之间，她忘记了奇迹号即将到来。那个白痴怎么能在做这些破事时还如此放松？真是气人！

The pan was about to be introduced to the wall when its content finally began to condense. Asuka's pulse settled, her hands steadied and slowly, she began to slightly enjoy herself. Memories of watching Shinji flashed as the meat browned. At first, his movements had been robotic, his efforts forced, while the food had been less than bland at best. That morning and many before it, Shinji's energy had felt revoltingly contagious.  
当锅里的内容物终于开始凝结时，锅差点就要被甩到墙上了。明日香的脉搏平复下来，双手稳住了，慢慢地，她开始略微享受起这个过程。看着肉片煎得金黄，她脑海中闪过观看真嗣做饭的记忆。起初，他的动作机械，努力显得勉强，而食物最多也只能说是乏味。那个早晨以及之前的许多个早晨，真嗣的精力都让人感到恶心地具有传染性。

_Bouncing from side to side like a damn tennis ball_. _Idiot tripped on Kensuke's helmet and didn't skip a beat when getting back up._  
像个该死的网球一样左右弹跳。白痴被健介的头盔绊倒了，站起来时却连一拍都没落下。

"Glaze the meat side to side with the sauce,'" Asuka recited. She applied a generous coat of sauce to the chicken fillets. "'Cover if possible to cook thoroughly. Add salt, pepper and fresh spices at the end.' Alright, easy."  
“将肉两面都涂上酱汁，”明日香复述着。她给鸡胸肉片涂上了一层厚厚的酱料。“如果可能的话，盖上盖子彻底煮熟。最后加盐、胡椒和新鲜香料。”好的，很简单。

Taking a step back to admire her handiwork, Asuka's scowl melted under a confident smirk once the scents started to flow through the house. _Not too bad for my second ever try at this crap. That'll teach the idiot to step up his gam-_  
退后一步欣赏自己的杰作，随着香气开始在屋内弥漫，明日香的皱眉在自信的微笑下消融。第二次尝试这玩意儿，还算不错。这下那白痴该知道提升自己的游戏水平了——

"I'm home!" Shinji greeted from the door, making her pulse quicken again. His head perk up in the kitchen's direction. "Hi, Asuka! Is that an apron?" He blinked upon noticing the fragrance in the air. "Are you cooking?"  
"我回来了！" 真嗣在门口打招呼，让她心跳再次加速。他朝厨房方向抬起头。"嗨，明日香！那是围裙吗？" 他眨了眨眼，注意到空气中的香味。"你在做饭吗？"

"Do you _ever_ get tired of asking obvious questions?" Asuka snapped back. "I was bored, there was stuff around. Are you supposed to be the only one allowed to cook or something?"  
"你难道不厌倦问这些显而易见的问题吗？" 明日香反唇相讥。"我无聊，周围有材料。难道只有你才能做饭不成？"

"It smells amazing," Shinji complimented, and once more completely ignore her efforts to be unpleasant. 'What are you making?"  
"闻起来真香，" 真嗣称赞道，又一次完全忽视了她试图表现出的不悦。'你在做什么？"

_Something that'll probably taste like crap. What do you care, anyway? Who said this is for you? Like I didn't already tell you I don't need food. Hell, it could be for Kensuke for all the idiot knows, or it could just be a trial run to kill time.  
大概是些尝起来会很糟糕的东西。反正你又在乎什么？谁说这是为你做的？我不是早就告诉过你我不需要食物吗。见鬼，这可能是给 Kensuke 那个白痴的，或者只是为了打发时间的一次试做。_

"Uhm, Asuka?"  "呃，Asuka？"

"Chicken," was her curt reply. "Suzuhara had to put one down. Can't waste resources and all that." Asuka's eye narrowed upon noticing Shinji was sitting by the table with the dictionary open, but his gaze repeatedly jumped to her. "What?"  
"鸡，"她简短地回答。"铃原不得不宰了一只。不能浪费资源什么的。" 注意到真嗣坐在桌旁，字典摊开着，但他的目光不时跳向她，明日香眯起了眼睛。"怎么了？"

"It's kind of late," he murmured while pretending to outline a word in the page. "Is Kensuke still busy at the ration center?"  
"已经挺晚了，"他低声说，假装在页面上勾勒一个单词。"健介还在补给中心忙吗？"

"He's busy at that stupid radio tower," Asuka growled. His sheepish little grin still made her angry. "Something about the landing gear for the Wunder, too. He'll probably stay the night at Hikari's place. Closer to the station and all that."  
"他在那愚蠢的无线电塔那儿忙，"明日香咆哮道。他那羞怯的小笑容仍让她生气。"还跟什么 Wunder 的着陆装置有关。他可能会在光那里过夜。离电台近，方便些。"

A stolen glance to the table confirmed Shinji was half-paralyzed with shock. His hand had stopped scribbling mid-sentence, eyes wide and mouth slightly agape. The reaction only sent her own nerves haywire, which made Asuka feel grateful for the hoodie obscuring her face.  
偷瞄一眼桌子，确认了真嗣正处于半瘫痪的震惊状态。他的手停在半句潦草的字迹上，眼睛瞪得大大的，嘴巴微张。这一反应让她的神经更加错乱，这让明日香感激起遮住脸的连帽衫来。

"I-I should go try to help, then," Shinji said after a few minutes, just as the meat finished cooking. "They always need any extra pair of hands they can g-"  
"我-我应该去帮忙，"真嗣几分钟后说道，正好肉也烤好了。"他们总是需要任何能多出的手来-"

"You're going to sit there, have dinner and not overwork yourself," Asuka interrupted, fuming. Her tone left no room for argument. "He's probably using that as an excuse to go drink with old man Horaki." She pointed towards the bathroom with her back to him. "You will take a damn shower, sit back down, and eat."  
"你就坐在这儿，吃饭，别把自己累坏了，"明日香打断道，怒气冲冲。她的语气不容反驳。"他可能只是用这个借口去和老霍拉基喝酒。"她背对着他指向浴室。"你去洗个澡，坐回来，吃饭。"

The chair creaked loudly as Shinji stood, gave her a half nod and hurried disappeared behind the sliding door.  
椅子吱嘎作响，真嗣站起身，向她微微点头后便匆匆消失在滑动门后。

Asuka exhaled in relief when the sound of water echoed through the house. _Still need a couple of minutes for this dumb, half-burnt rice,_ she thought. _Whatever. Just do this one thing, Asuka. Make a meal for the brat who fought against you and tried to end the world tw… ugh. Can't even think it properly, anymore._  
当水声在屋内回荡时，明日香松了口气。她心想，这半生不熟的米饭还得再等几分钟。无所谓了，就做这一件事吧，明日香。为那个与你对抗并试图毁灭世界的臭小子做顿饭……呃，连想都难以正确地想下去了。

"Hollow," she murmured. "Lacking in real value, sincerity, or substance."  
“空洞，”她低声自语，“缺乏真正的价值、真诚或实质。”

Asuka did little else than throw the food on the plate, an antithesis to Shinji's minute care of the portions. She almost slammed both dishes on the table before taking a seat, only to notice she still had the apron on. She quickly changed into an oversized shirt and some shorts Mari had gifted her, opting to leave the jacket on the mattress.  
明日香除了把食物扔到盘子上外，几乎没做别的，这与真嗣对分量的细致照顾形成了鲜明对比。她几乎将两盘菜猛地放在桌上，然后坐下，才注意到自己还系着围裙。她迅速换上玛丽送给她的一件 oversized 衬衫和短裤，选择把夹克留在床垫上。

"Can I help you with anything?" Shinji came to the living room dressed in the black tracksuit, looking as apprehensive as she felt. "Viko gave me some lemonade and a couple of pears."  
“需要我帮忙吗？”真嗣穿着黑色运动服来到客厅，看起来和她一样忐忑。“维克托给了我一些柠檬水和几个梨。”

"Lemonade's on the table." Asuka's foot began to tap against the floor. "Pears would be a good dessert. You're on dish duty after dinner."  
“柠檬水在桌上。”明日香的脚开始敲打地板。“梨作为甜点不错。饭后洗碗的任务就交给你了。”

_Isn't he always? 他不是一直都这样吗？_

"Aren't I always on dish duty?" he asked in perfect synchronicity with her brain.  
"我不是总是在洗碗吗？" 他完美地与她的思绪同步问道。

"Heh, maybe." Stifling another chuckle, Asuka nodded towards the seat. "Food's gonna get cold, idiot."  
"呵呵，也许吧。" 阿斯卡忍住又一声轻笑，点头示意座位。"食物要凉了，笨蛋。"

"Right! Sorry." Shinji sat back down and instantly began to look everywhere but at her or the dish. "It… looks amazing."  
“好！抱歉。” 真嗣坐回原位，立刻开始四处张望，就是不看她或那道菜。“它……看起来很棒。”

_Liar.  骗子。_

"I made a point of not making it elegant," Asuka rebuked. The familiar glare shone on her features. "So spare me the false praise and formalities."  
“我特意没把它做得那么精致，”明日香反驳道。她那熟悉的目光在脸上闪现。“所以别来那些虚假的赞美和客套话了。”

"Huh? Formalities?" Shinji seemed genuinely confused, which only angered her further. He remained oblivious to it, and gently prodded at the finely carved flesh. "The browning is great! I always have trouble getting the right temperature. And the rice looks crunchy, just the way I like!"  
"嗯？礼节？" 真嗣显得一头雾水，这让她更加恼火。他对此浑然不觉，还温柔地戳了戳那精心烹制的肉块。"烤得真好！我总是掌握不好火候。而且这米饭看起来脆脆的，正是我喜欢的！"

_You like burnt rice?_ Asuka blinked, looking away as a pang of sadness and shame sunk into her chest. _I didn't… I didn't know that. I don't really know anything about you._  
你喜欢焦一点的米饭？明日香眨了眨眼，转过头去，一阵悲伤和羞愧涌上心头。我……我不知道。我其实对你一无所知。

"Well, lucky for you there's half a pan left of your crunchy delight," she rasped. "Let's eat, then."  
"好吧，算你走运，还有半锅你那脆脆的美味。" 她沙哑地说道。"那我们开动吧。"

"Thank you for the meal," Shinji said. The words were meant for her, not some random deity. She noticed his cheeks color slightly. "I don't remember the last time someone made something like this for me."  
"谢谢你的餐点，" 真嗣说道。这话本是对她说的，而非某个随机的神明。她注意到他的脸颊微微泛红。"我不记得上次有人为我做这样的东西是什么时候了。"

"Who said it's for you?" Asuka rebuked and resisted the urge to flinch. Shinji's chopsticks halted mid-air, eyes downcast. _Great, solid strategy. Make the idiot lose his appetite, why don't you._ "I've been getting these waves of fatigue lately," she started with a milder tone, and pierced a piece of chicken with her fork. "Only thing that helps is if I eat something. Been getting hungrier, as well."  
"谁说是为你做的？" 明日香反驳道，强忍住退缩的冲动。真嗣的筷子在空中停住，目光低垂。太好了，真是高招。让这傻瓜没了胃口，你可真行。"我最近一直感到疲劳，" 她换了个温和的语气，用叉子戳起一块鸡肉。"唯一能缓解的就是吃点东西。而且越来越饿。"

"Fatigue?" "疲劳？"

_Fish caught the line the moment it saw the bait,_ she mused, suppressing a smile. "Eh, it's no big deal, not nearly enough to hinder my performance. Probably the boredom getting to me."  
鱼儿一见到饵就咬住了线，她暗自思忖，强忍笑意。“哎，没什么大不了的，还不至于影响我的表现。大概只是无聊感作祟吧。”

The silence at the table became stifling_._  
餐桌上的沉默变得令人窒息。

_Jeez, I didn't mean it, okay,_ Asuka thought, not looking up. _You can't possibly be so clueless, can you? This is probably the last time you and I are going to be sitting at the same table. Wunder's arriving in two days. Time's up._  
天哪，我不是那个意思，好吗，明日香心想，没有抬头。你不可能这么迟钝吧？这可能是你我最后一次坐在同一张桌子前了。温德两天后就要到了。时间到了。

She was about to demand what the problem was with the food, but realized Shinji was eating very slowly. He'd take a demure bite, not unlike she did with every meal, but instead of growling or scowling, his eyes would close. With every passing second, it became clear just how focused he was.  
她正要质问这食物有什么问题，却注意到真嗣吃得很慢。他小心翼翼地咬上一口，和她每顿饭的吃法颇为相似，但不同的是，他没有咆哮或皱眉，而是闭上了眼睛。随着每一秒的流逝，他专注的程度愈发明显。

After the third bite, he started to smile. "I'm sorry," he muttered, straightening up. "The taste is incredible… chicken's cooked perfectly. The seasoning's balanced and makes the sweetness of the sauce stand out, and… uhm…" A chuckle escaped his throat. "I'm sorry."  
第三口之后，他开始微笑。“对不起，”他喃喃道，坐直了身子。“这味道太美妙了……鸡肉煮得恰到好处。调味平衡，让酱汁的甜味更加突出，而且……呃……”他喉咙里发出一声轻笑。“对不起。”

"It's fine." Asuka dismissed his apology with a shrug. "So it's edible? Heh, that's good to know."  
“没事。”明日香耸耸肩，不以为意地打发掉了他的道歉。“所以能吃？嘿，那倒是好消息。”

Shinji offered a shaky smile. "It's delicious."  
真嗣挤出一个颤抖的微笑。“非常美味。”

"Whatever, idiot," Asuka looked away, cheeks burning. "Don't let it get cold, you'll spoil the taste."  
“随你怎么说，笨蛋，”明日香别过头去，脸颊发烫。“别让它凉了，会破坏味道的。”

_What's that word Mari uses all the time? Ah, empathy,_ she thought, watching as Shinji immersed himself in the contrast of flavours. His body language displayed complete honesty; the meal was to his liking. This was probably the first time in his life that somebody not only cooked specifically for him, but also sat down to enjoy said meal with him.  
玛丽经常用的那个词是什么来着？啊，同理心，她想着，看着真嗣沉浸在味道的对比中。他的肢体语言流露出完全的真诚；这顿饭很合他的胃口。这可能是他人生中第一次，有人不仅特意为他烹饪，还坐下来与他一同享用这顿饭。

_I know how that feels,_ Asuka realized. _I get angry because that's all I know how to do. But you understand, somehow you don't mind it too much. Heh. No hard feelings, First. If it's any consolation, I had to wait fourteen freaking years for my do-over._  
我知道那种感觉，明日香意识到。我生气是因为我只知道这样做。但不知怎的，你理解了，你并不太介意。呵呵。没有怨恨，初号机。如果这能让你好受些，我可是等了整整十四年才等到这个重来的机会。

"So, burnt rice," she said after the silence began to feel forced. "How come you like it? Isn't it supposed to be cooked to perfection and all that?"  
“所以，焦米饭，”她打破沉默，感觉再不说话就太刻意了。“你为什么喜欢它？不是应该煮得完美无缺吗？”

Shinji smiled. "My teacher used to leave it to warm on the stove when I was little," he retailed, stifling a shaky giggle. "It always burnt, but he had a way of just shrugging his shoulders that'd make me laugh. We'd mix the rice with ketchup and soy sauce."  
真嗣微笑道：“我小时候，老师常常把它放在炉子上保温，”他回忆着，忍住颤抖的笑声。“它总是烧焦，但他那种耸肩的方式总能让我笑出来。我们会把米饭和番茄酱、酱油拌在一起吃。”

"Sauce's got some soy in it." Asuka pushed the small bowl in his direction, feeling a burst of electricity when their fingers brushed. "Probably the one moment that felt like bonding between you and your teacher, huh," she realized. "What was the first thing you tried to cook?"  
"酱汁里掺了点酱油。" 明日香将小碗推向他，手指相触的瞬间感到一阵电流涌动。"大概是你和你的老师之间难得的情感交流时刻吧，" 她恍然大悟。"你第一次尝试做的是什么菜？"

The inquiry had the desired effect; Shinji relaxed even more and laughed to himself. His plate had long since been emptied, which brought a sense of elation not unlike the day they had given her the Shikinami name.  
这个问题达到了预期效果；真嗣更加放松，自顾自地笑了起来。他的盘子早已空空如也，这让她感到一种喜悦，与那天他们赋予她“式波”之名时的激动不相上下。

"I tried to cook some instant ramen," he admitted with a snicker. "Thing is… I dialed one hundred minutes instead of one. Well, you can imagine my surprise when something exploded inside the microwave, which in turn started to short-circuit and smoke."  
"我试着煮了些方便面，" 他笑着承认。"问题是……我把时间设成了 100 分钟而不是 1 分钟。嗯，你可以想象微波炉里爆炸、接着开始短路冒烟时我有多惊讶。"

Again, his energy felt contagious, and Asuka had to bite her lip to keep a laugh from escaping. "I don't suppose your teacher was very happy about your experiment."  
他的活力似乎具有感染力，明日香不得不咬住嘴唇以防笑声泄露。“我想你的老师对你的实验不会太高兴吧。”

"Not really, he didn't get mad," Shinji sobered up some. She noticed a bit of sadness reflect on his gaze. "Maybe I was half-hoping he'd actually get mad and… pay some attention to me or something. But he didn't," he added shook his head and smiled again. "Truth be told, I got a little scared of using the microwave, so I started trying my luck at the kitchen. I did burn the rice afterwards, though."  
“其实没有，他没生气，”真嗣的神情稍微严肃了些。她注意到他的眼神中闪过一丝悲伤。“也许我半是希望他真的会生气，然后……多少关注我一下什么的。但他没有，”他补充道，摇了摇头，又笑了。“说实话，我开始有点害怕用微波炉，所以就尝试在厨房里碰碰运气。不过后来我把米饭煮糊了。”

Asuka refilled both plates in a quick dash to the kitchen to stifle her giggling. "Idiot," she muttered, not realizing how fondness leaked into her voice. "Still hungry?"  
明日香迅速跑进厨房重新装满两人的盘子，以抑制自己的笑声。“笨蛋，”她低声说，没意识到自己的声音中流露出了宠溺。“还饿吗？”

"Starving, actually," Shinji replied. "The food's really delicious, Asuka. Do you-" she heard him gulp. "-do you cook often?"  
"实际上是饿坏了，" 真嗣回答道。"食物真的很美味，明日香。你——" 她听到他咽了口口水。"——你经常做饭吗？"

The innocuous compliment along with Shinji's wish for seconds made her chest swell with ominous fulfillment. "I don't cook, period," Asuka replied, eliciting a laugh. "This is about the third or fourth time ever. First time was during training. One day they ran out of rations, so I just snuck into the kitchens and made onion soup with a bit of marrow and potatoes I found. It was greasy and way too salty, but it was warm. Heh, I remember sitting in the forest, on top of this old, fallen tree, eating my soup with a dumb smirk on my face."  
这句无伤大雅的赞美加上真嗣想要再吃一点的愿望，让她心中涌起了一种不祥的满足感。"我根本不做饭，" 明日香回答道，引得一阵笑声。"这大概是第三次或第四次吧。第一次是在训练期间。有一天他们用完了补给，我就偷偷溜进厨房，用找到的一些骨髓和土豆做了洋葱汤。虽然油腻又太咸，但至少是热的。嘿，我记得当时坐在森林里，坐在一棵倒下的老树上，一边喝汤一边傻笑。"

"Apparently your first try went way better than mine," Shinji mentioned. "No surprise, really. You strike me as someone that can be the best in anything she sets her mind to." Asuka raised an eyebrow when he slapped a hand over his mouth again. "Sorry."  
"显然你的第一次尝试比我好多了，" 真嗣说道。"这并不奇怪。你给我的感觉是，只要下定决心，什么事都能做到最好。" 明日香扬起眉毛，只见他又用手捂住了嘴。"抱歉。"

"Stop apologizing, damn you," growled Asuka, almost slamming the plate in front of him. "There's never any time to do something I 'set my mind to', Shinji. Most of the it's just following orders. 'Do this, pilot that. Fight here, sleep over there. Get up, go back to your cage'. The times I made a choice it ended with the food I made probably rotting away in the kitchen, and with this," She glared at her plate, then pointed to the eyepatch. "Couldn't even stop your idiot butt from messing up, so where do you get that idea from?"  
"别再道歉了，该死的，" 明日香低吼着，几乎将盘子猛地摔在他面前。"我从来没时间去做那些我'下定决心'的事，真嗣。大部分时候只是服从命令。'做这个，驾驶那个。在这里战斗，在那里睡觉。起床，回到你的笼子'。我做出选择的那些时刻，结果往往是我在厨房做的食物可能已经腐烂，还有这个，" 她瞪着自己的盘子，然后指向眼罩。"甚至没能阻止你这个白痴搞砸一切，你到底是从哪儿来的这种想法？"

_Yeah, way to keep bringing down the mood, Asuka,_ she thought right as her mouth closed. _This is the last time you'll get to do this, the only time, and you're messing it up. Eh, better this way. Best to just rip the band-aid off and let him see there's nothing left to rebuild her-_  
是啊，真会破坏气氛，明日香，她刚闭上嘴就想到。这是你最后一次做这件事，唯一的一次，而你却在搞砸它。唉，这样也好。最好就是直接撕掉创可贴，让他看到已经没有什么可以重建的了——

"The food you made?" Shinji asked. "You cooked something before… before Unit 03?"  
"你做的食物？" 真嗣问道。"你之前做过什么……在 03 号机之前？"

"Yeah, what about it?" "““嗯，那又怎样？””

"Nothing, just…" he offered a small, sad smile. "Rei told me about the meal with Father, but I had no idea. I would've loved to have that chance." His eyes drifted to the meal. "I'm grateful."  
"没什么，只是……" 他露出了一个微弱而悲伤的微笑。"丽告诉我关于和父亲一起吃饭的事，但我完全不知道。我本希望能有那样的机会。" 他的目光飘向了饭菜。"我很感激。"

Misato's recounting of the events that followed her synch with Unit 03 were vague at best, but from what she gathered, Shinji had not stepped foot in the apartment again. There was no way for him to know there had been food there. _Thanking me for some crappy sludge I put together fourteen years ago. Heh, what an idiot._  
美里对同步 Unit 03 后发生的事情描述得含糊其辞，但据她所知，真嗣再也没有踏进过公寓。他不可能知道那里曾经有过食物。感谢我十四年前匆匆拼凑的糟糕糊状物。呵呵，真是个傻瓜。

"You're welcome," Asuka muttered in between bites. "Food's not so bad after all, is it?"  
"不客气，" 明日香边吃边嘟囔着。"食物其实也没那么糟，对吧？"

"Not so bad? It's amazing! And I'm not just saying that," Shinji's features relaxed further. "It's totally different from any recipe I know. I would've never guessed you don't cook often after trying this."  
“不算差？简直太棒了！我可不是随便说说，” 真嗣的表情更加放松了。“这和我所知的任何食谱都截然不同。尝过这个之后，我绝对猜不到你其实不常做饭。”

_That's because you didn't see me burn fish and rice twice in your dumb little beach kitchen.  
“那是因为你没看到我在你那愚蠢的小海滩厨房里两次把鱼和米饭烧焦。”_

"Whatever." She deflected the praise and looked away, fully aware of the blush creeping up her cheeks. "Idiot Tree's doing well?"  
“随便啦。” 她避开赞扬，转过头去，完全意识到自己脸颊上的红晕在蔓延。“傻树还好吗？”

"It is! Viko explained why it hasn't sprouted any new leaves. I checked on yours, too," he admitted sheepishly. "They're all doing great, I counted two new leaves on three of them."  
"确实！Viko 解释了为什么它还没长出新叶子。我也检查了你的，"他有些不好意思地承认道，"它们都长得很好，我数了数，有三棵各长了两片新叶。"

"Two whole new leaves, wow," Asuka replied sarcastically. "The world is saved because I dug four plants into the ground."  
"整整两片新叶，哇，"明日香讽刺地回应，"世界得救了，因为我种了四棵植物。"

"Little by little, bit by bit," Shinji said, then uttered a loud groan and slammed his forehead against the table. "I sound like him now. That was _so_ lame," he shook his head in disbelief and apparent disgust.  
"一点一滴，慢慢来，"真嗣说道，随即发出一声大吼，额头猛地撞在桌子上，"我现在说话跟他一样了。真是太逊了，"他难以置信地摇着头，显然感到厌恶。"

"Heh." This time, Asuka was unable to restrain the small chuckle. "There are worse things in this world than sounding like that blonde goof. I'll take his moronic one-liners over the alternative of a catatonic idiot." Shinji laughed, that soft, calming sound she was fond of. "Good to know the tree brats are not dead, yet."  
"嘿。" 这次，明日香忍不住轻笑出声。"世界上比那个金发傻瓜更糟糕的事情多了去了。比起一个木僵的白痴，我宁愿听他那些愚蠢的俏皮话。" 真嗣笑了，那柔和而令人安心的声音，她很是喜欢。"知道那些树小子还没死，真好。"

Using the pejorative term she had wrongfully bestowed on him felt right again. _Fine,_ the major barked, defeated as more snickers rang through the room. _He's not a little brat anymore. But the stupid trees are, so that'll be their name until they bear fruit or whatever._  
再次使用她错误地强加给他的贬义词，感觉又对了。好吧，少校咆哮着，败下阵来，因为更多的窃笑声在房间里回荡。他不再是小毛孩了。但那些愚蠢的树还是，所以他们就叫这个名字，直到他们结果或者别的什么。

"I like this place," Shinji remarked long after his plate had been emptied. "The village, the forest, the people, the work," he carried on when their eyes met. "Sometimes I wonder if what I'm feeling is happiness, and if so, I wonder why I'm allowed to enjoy it."  
"我喜欢这个地方，" 真嗣在盘子早已空空如也后很久才说道。"这个村庄，这片森林，这里的人，这里的工作，" 当他们的目光相遇时，他继续说道。"有时候我在想，我所感受到的是否就是幸福，如果是的话，我又为何被允许享受它。"

Asuka's thoughts drifted to the quiet evenings spent fishing. They rarely spoke more than a few words, it was a boring, uneventful way of wasting hours upon hours. More than once the very same question had flashed through her mind. Then, the blade of sorrow sunk deep into her cage, hollowing out any joy the evening might have brought.  
明日香的思绪飘向了那些安静的垂钓夜晚。他们很少交谈，只是无聊且平淡地消磨着时间。不止一次，同样的疑问在她脑海中闪过。随后，悲伤的刀刃深深刺入她的心房，掏空了夜晚本可能带来的任何欢乐。

"You can stay here," she revealed. Her eye fell on the corner, on the dictionary lying atop Shinji's blankets. "Help, build, cook for those brutes who dig holes by the barrier. Fish with those annoying birds and their weird leader." A defeated sigh escaped her. "You can enact your penance here, for the rest of your life. Who knows how long _that_ will be, with the Curse of Eva and all, so you've got plenty of time to continue atoning."  
“你可以留在这里，”她透露道。目光落在角落，那本字典正躺在真嗣的被子上。“帮助、建造、为那些在屏障旁挖洞的野蛮人做饭。和那些烦人的鸟以及它们古怪的领袖一起钓鱼。”她无奈地叹了口气。“你可以在这里度过余生，进行你的赎罪。谁知道《EVA 的诅咒》会持续多久，所以你有大把时间继续赎罪。”

Expecting relief, dissolution or even denial, Asuka turned to him. Shinji's eyes were filled with an indescribable sadness, as though whatever hopes he had built until that point had just been shattered.  
期待着解脱、释然甚至否认，明日香转向他。真嗣的眼中充满了难以言喻的悲伤，仿佛他此前构筑的所有希望在这一刻都破碎了。

"Is my father really going through with his plan?"  
"我父亲真的要实施他的计划吗？"

"Of course he is," Asuka replied instantly. "Whatever humanity he had, if he ever had any, is long gone. That's what all the fuss is about, you know this better than anyone. All he cares about is his precious scenario."  
"当然，" 明日香立刻回答道。"他曾经可能有的人性，如果他有过的话，早已荡然无存。这就是所有骚动的根源，你比任何人都清楚。他现在只在乎他那宝贵的剧本。"

"Then everybody in the village…" Shinji's gaze hardened as it fixed on the window. "It would become core energy. Everything would disappear."  
"那么村里的每个人……" 真嗣的目光变得坚定，凝视着窗外。"他们都会变成核心能量。一切都将消失。"

"Pretty much," Asuka confirmed nonchalantly. "That's why we're going to fight. It's probably a lost cause, all things considered, but if by some miracle we stop him, your penance should continue undisturbed."  
"差不多吧，" 明日香漫不经心地确认道。"这就是我们要战斗的原因。考虑到所有情况，这可能是一场注定失败的战斗，但如果奇迹发生，我们阻止了他，你的赎罪应该会继续不受干扰。"

"You're going," Shinji said, defeated. "To fight, I mean."  
"你要去，" 真嗣无力地说道。"我是说去战斗。"

"I'm a pilot." The statement was resolute. "Not much of a choice, and if I had one, I'd choose to go and fight. It's who I am."  
"我是一名驾驶员。" 这句话坚定不移。"没有太多选择，即使有选择，我也会选择去战斗。这就是我。"

Uncertainty clouded Shinji's features. It looked as though he wanted to ask her something, but had not yet mustered up the courage to do so. "If I… Uhm," He scratched at the scar on his wrist. "It'd be bad if I got into the ship, wouldn't it? I heard people say lots of the crew members in the Wunder hate me."  
不确定的神情笼罩在真嗣的脸上。他似乎想问她些什么，却还未鼓起勇气。“如果我……呃，”他挠了挠手腕上的伤疤。“如果我登上那艘船，会很糟糕吧？我听说 Wunder 上的许多船员都讨厌我。”

"They do," Asuka confirmed. "And in this fantasy world of yours, do you climb into your Eva again?"  
“确实如此，”明日香确认道。“在你这个幻想的世界里，你还会再次爬进你的 Eva 吗？”

"Would anybody even let me?" Shinji asked instead. "Misato, Toji's sister, even that sailor; they think if I pilot Unit 01, then the world will surely end. And… a big part of me agrees with them."  
“会有人让我这么做吗？”真嗣反问道。“美里、远志的妹妹，甚至那个水兵；他们都认为如果我驾驶 01 号机，世界肯定会毁灭。而且……我内心很大一部分也同意他们的看法。”

"Sit up straight. I'm only going to say this once, so pay attention." Asuka's commanding tone immediately drew his attention to her eye. "The world's probably going to end, anyway. We're outgunned, outnumbered. This is a Hail Mary, last ditch attempt to make a slight difference, or at the very least, win a little more time. A few more decades if you're lucky, so your idiot tree can grow."  
"坐直了。我只说一次，所以注意听。" 明日香命令式的语气立刻吸引了他的目光。"反正世界可能也要完蛋了。我们火力不足，人数也不占优势。这是孤注一掷，最后一搏，试图稍微改变点什么，或者至少，争取多一点时间。运气好的话，能多撑几十年，让你的笨蛋树苗长大。"

Doubt slowly faded from Shinji's features as he nodded. "Almost every single time I've piloted, I've messed it up. Would Unit 01 make a difference?"  
怀疑慢慢从真嗣的脸上消失，他点头道："每次我驾驶，几乎都搞砸了。初号机能有所作为吗？"

"Lots of woulds and ifs in this dreamworld," she grumbled, and swallowed whatever remained of her pride. "Unit 01's awakened, it had enough power to almost start an Impact. It defeated and merged the strongest Angel with little to no difficulty."  
"这个梦里充满了如果和假设，"她咕哝着，咽下了剩下的自尊。"初号机已经觉醒，它拥有足以引发冲击的强大力量。它几乎没有遇到什么困难就击败并融合了最强的使徒。"

"Yeah, but that wasn't me-" Shinji cut himself off, eyes widening. He was probably reliving those moments. "-I mean, it was. And look at what happened."  
"是啊，但那不是我——" 真嗣突然打住，眼睛睁大了。他可能正在重温那些时刻。"——我是说，那确实是我。看看发生了什么。"

"Stop going in circles, idiot," said Asuka. She offered a bored half-glare and pointed at the dictionary. "So you messed up. How many cups did you mess up before you managed to build one that worked?"  
"别绕圈子了，笨蛋，" 明日香说道。她半是厌烦地瞪了一眼，指着字典。"所以你搞砸了。你搞砸了多少个杯子才成功做出一个能用的？"

Asuka suppressed a victorious smirk when Shinji's back straightened.  
当真嗣的背挺直时，明日香抑制住了一丝得意的微笑。

"If you want to come to the Wunder, what awaits you is a cage, a leash and a collar. In between, the tiny chance that you might make a difference."  
"如果你想来到 Wunder，等待你的将是一个笼子、一条锁链和一个项圈。其间，微乎其微的机会或许能让你有所作为。"

"Just like it's your choice to go and fight, it's my choice to either go or stay," Shinji realized at last. She almost smiled at the way his resolve steeled further. "Asuka, I think I'd like to go with you."  
"就像你有选择去战斗，我也有选择去或留，" 真嗣终于意识到。她几乎因他决心更加坚定而微笑。"明日香，我想我会愿意和你一起去。"

A weight she had barely realized existed dropped from her shoulders. The hand constricting her breathing for fourteen years relented some. "Even if it means living in a cage, being treated like a weapon, or a rabid, dangerous dog at best, drinking water distilled from piss and fighting endlessly in a losing war? Even if it means being the on receiving end to the crew's hatred?"  
她几乎未曾察觉的重担从肩上卸下。那只束缚她呼吸十四年的手稍稍放松。"即使这意味着生活在笼中，被当作武器，或充其量是一只狂暴危险的狗，饮用从尿液中提炼的水，在一场注定失败的战争中无休止地战斗？即使这意味着承受船员们的憎恨？"

Shinji nodded. "Yes." 真嗣点点头。"是的。"

"Even if it means never seeing your stupid tree again, or the dumb penguins, or that purple-haired brat and his goofy guardian?"  
"即使这意味着再也见不到你那棵愚蠢的树，那些笨拙的企鹅，还有那个紫发小子和他的傻瓜守护者？"

His gaze remained steadfast. "Yes."  
他的目光依旧坚定。"是的。"

"The ship arrives in two days," Asuka revealed, rising from the table. Shinji followed right after and began washing the dishes. "You have until then to change your mind and see reason. Do I make myself clear?"  
"船两天后到达，" 明日香透露道，从桌旁站起身。真嗣紧随其后开始洗碗。"在那之前，你有足够的时间改变主意并看清现实。我说得够清楚了吗？"

"Crystal, Asuka," he nodded in her direction. "Thank you."  
"非常清楚，明日香，" 他向她点头致意。"谢谢你。"

_Stop thanking me, damn you! It's weird!  
别再谢我了，该死！这很奇怪！_

"Yeah, yeah." She walked over to the dictionary, noticing how the roundel was nowhere in sight. "You finished translating that song of yours?"  
“是是。”她走向字典，注意到圆徽章不见了踪影。“你那首歌翻译完了吗？”

"I did," Shinji replied from the kitchen. "Although I have to say, doesn't sound nearly as good in Japanese."  
“我翻译完了。”真嗣从厨房回答。“不过我得说，用日语唱起来没那么好听。”

"Heh, you probably just suck at singing."  
“嘿，你大概只是唱得烂吧。”

The words felt unnecessarily harsh. Something was compelling Asuka to at least try to apologize, but then Shinji laughed again. Her instincts and nerves, on edge since she had started cooking, settled at last.  
这些话显得过于严厉了。有什么东西驱使着明日香至少尝试道歉，但随后真嗣又笑了。自从她开始做饭以来一直紧绷的本能和神经，终于放松了下来。

"I'd have to ask the penguins," he added in between chuckles. "It's not so cold out tonight, and… I think the curse started to settle in. I can still taste everything, still get hungry and thirsty. Do you want to… talk a little more?"  
"我得问问那些企鹅，"他在笑声中补充道，"今晚外面没那么冷，而且……我觉得诅咒开始生效了。我还能尝到味道，还是会饿会渴。你想……再多聊一会儿吗？"

"The _curse_, huh," Asuka yawned and walked over to the door. "Not much else to do, anyway. Get over here, then, idiot. Bring your stupid music box thingy."  
"诅咒啊，"明日香打了个哈欠，走向门口，"反正也没别的事可做。过来吧，笨蛋。带上你那愚蠢的音乐盒。"

She demanded to hear the song later that night, as they sat side by side and shared earphones. The improvement in Shinji's calligraphy ever since starting the translation was almost a mirror image of his health. He was explaining something about one of the classical pieces when it happened. Asuka nodded off and unconsciously grabbed onto his arm like a pillow. That night, as the gentle tunes of Shinji's music soothed her senses, there was no denying she lost consciousness for well over four hours.  
她要求当晚听那首歌，他们并肩坐着，共享一副耳机。自从开始翻译以来，真嗣的书法进步几乎是他健康的镜像。他正在解释一首古典作品时，事情发生了。明日香打起了瞌睡，无意识地抓住他的手臂当作枕头。那晚，随着真嗣音乐的柔和旋律抚慰她的感官，她无法否认自己昏睡了四个多小时。

That night, Asuka dreamed.  
那晚，明日香做梦了。

"Nice view, right?" “风景不错吧？”

Rei slowly turned to face a smiling Hikari dressed in her night clothes. She nodded, switching her gaze to the stars shining above as the older woman gingerly took a seat next to her. The night creatures were especially loud that night, drowning the dull aches of her body in a magnificent natural symphony.  
丽缓缓转身，面对着穿着睡衣、面带微笑的光。她点头，将目光转向头顶闪烁的星星，年长的女子小心翼翼地在她身旁坐下。那一夜，夜行动物的叫声格外响亮，将她身体的隐隐作痛淹没在一场壮丽的自然交响乐中。

"The stars are beautiful," Rei murmured. The moon glistened crimson-silver, the breeze's temperature was perfect. Clad in her plugsuit and watching the seconds tick away, she felt slightly frightened. "I wonder if the tale that souls go there afterwards is true."  
“星星真美，”丽低声说。月亮闪烁着红银色的光芒，微风的温度恰到好处。她身着驾驶服，看着时间一分一秒流逝，感到一丝恐惧。“不知道灵魂升天后是否真的存在那样的传说。”

"Throughout history, hu manity has always looked to the stars to search for their loved ones, their predecessors, or their gods," Hikari replied, drawing Rei in a loose, warm embrace. "I like to think they're looking down with a smile, happy that they live on."  
“纵观历史，人类总是仰望星空，寻找他们的亲人、先祖或神明，”光回答道，将丽轻轻拥入一个温暖而不拘束的怀抱。“我喜欢这样想，他们正微笑着俯视我们，欣慰于自己的存在得以延续。”

"Live on?" Rei blinked in surprise. "How does one achieve this after the end?"  
"继续活着？" 丽惊愕地眨了眨眼。"在一切结束之后，如何才能做到这一点？"

According to their programming, nothing but darkness came after the end. They returned to the nothingness of Lilith's consciousness, as though they had never existed. Then, her own wishes and desires manifested with the answer.  
根据他们的程序设定，终结之后只有无尽的黑暗。他们回归到莉莉丝意识的虚无之中，仿佛从未存在过。然后，她自己的愿望和渴望以答案的形式显现。

"We live on the hearts and minds of those who hold us dear," Hikari's voice started to tremble. Her arm shook with restrained sobs as the hold on Rei's body tightened. "We stay there for as long as they remember us, and bring them happiness and smiles whenever they think of us."  
"我们活在那些深爱我们的人的心中和脑海里，" 光的声音开始颤抖。她的手臂因压抑的哭泣而颤抖，对丽的拥抱也更加紧了。"只要他们还记得我们，我们就会在那里停留，每当他们想起我们时，我们就会带给他们快乐和微笑。"

"Will you remember me?" asked Rei. A wave of emotion forced lonesome tears to cascade down her cheeks. "Will Shinji remember me?"  
"你会记得我吗？" 丽问道，一股情感的浪潮迫使孤独的泪水顺着她的脸颊滑落。"真嗣会记得我吗？"

"For as long as we breathe, all of us," Hikari reaffirmed through quiet sobs. "The workers at the fields, the kitchen staff, my husband, my grumpy dad, Tsubame, Asuka, and most of all… Shinji. Not a day will go by that he won't think of you, and smile."  
"只要我们还在呼吸，我们所有人都会记得，" 光在轻声啜泣中肯定道。"田间的工人们，厨房的员工，我的丈夫，我那脾气暴躁的爸爸，燕，明日香，尤其是……真嗣。他不会有一天不想起你，然后微笑。"

Rei closed her eyes and reveled in the warmth. _Perhaps this is a motherly embrace. Thank you, for yet another precious memory to take with me._ Her lower lip quivered. _I do not wish to go. Why must I part with this warmth and comfort?_  
丽闭上眼睛，沉浸在这份温暖中。也许这是一个母亲的拥抱。谢谢你，让我又多了一份珍贵的记忆。她的下唇颤抖着。我不想离开。为什么我必须与这份温暖和安慰分离？

"This will always be your home." Hikari kissed the top of her head. "You will always be here. In the fields, in the showers with your friends, reading books in the library. We'll make sure of that, Rei."  
"这里永远会是你的家。" 光轻轻吻了吻她的头顶。"你永远都会在这里。在田野间，在和朋友们的淋浴间，在图书馆里读书。我们会确保这一切，丽。"

Again, the aches faded completely. Rei's breathing quieted, the tears stopped flowing, and the same peace that had engulfed her once before took root in her chest. She remembered seeing Asuka show affection to Shinji, in her own way, and knowing he would not be alone.  
又一次，疼痛完全消失了。丽的呼吸平缓下来，泪水停止流淌，那份曾经包围过她的宁静再次在她的胸中扎根。她记得看到明日香以自己的方式向真嗣表达爱意，知道他不会孤单。

"I will remember you all, as well," she said. "And smile as the rice grows, or as the Idiot Tree bears fruit and shade." Her innocent gaze fell upon Hikari's teary one. "I am home."  
"我也会记住你们所有人，" 她说。"当稻谷生长，或是当傻瓜树结出果实和阴凉时，我会微笑。" 她纯真的目光落在光含泪的眼眸上。"我回家了。"

"Yes, you are," Hikari replied. "Welcome home, Rei."  
"是的，你是，"光回答道。"欢迎回家，丽。"

"… the Alstroemeria was particularly difficult. They bloom so rarely in this weird weather." Viko handed over the bouquet. There was no extra ornament aside from a red cloth holding it together. "Never mind the pink Camellias, boy were those tough!"  
"… 这株阿斯特罗梅里亚特别难伺候。在这种怪天气里它们开花得如此罕见。"维克递过花束，除了用一块红布扎在一起外，没有多余的装饰。"别提那些粉红色的山茶花了，那些可真难搞！"

Shinji's hand curled around the stems, careful not to damage a single petal. His heart was so loud it was deafening out the Viko's explanation altogether. The memory of Asuka yawning and settling against him had kept his breathing erratic all through the morning. His fingers were trembling as they held the flowers.  
真嗣的手轻轻环绕着花茎，小心翼翼不伤到任何一片花瓣。他的心跳声如此之大，以至于完全盖过了维克的解释。想起明日香打哈欠并靠在他身上的记忆，让他的呼吸整个早晨都变得急促而不稳定。他的手指颤抖着，紧握着这些花朵。

"-I mean, personally, I wouldn't go that extreme on the first try, but that's me!" Viko's voice resounded from afar. "My brother hated playing it safe, though. Ryoji does, too! So, your choice, Mr. Ikari."  
"- 我是说，个人而言，我不会第一次尝试就走那么极端，但那只是我！" 维科的声音从远处传来。"不过我哥哥讨厌稳妥行事。亮司也一样！所以，碇先生，你的选择。"

"Hmm?" Shinji shook his head and remembered why he was there in the first place. "My choice? What am I supposed to choose?"  
"嗯？" 真嗣摇了摇头，想起了他来这里的原因。"我的选择？我应该选择什么？"

"Oh boy, you're totally gone, aren't you?" Viko asked, barking a laugh. "Ryoji's going to absolutely love this! Anyway, and asking for the third time, by the way. The lilac, yes or no?"  
"哦，天哪，你完全不在状态，对吧？" 维科问道，发出一阵笑声。"亮司绝对会喜欢这个！顺便说一句，第三次问你了。紫丁香，是还是不是？"

"_Oh, that one's nice, can you be a dear and pick that up Shinji?"_ Hikari said in his mind. _"Purple lilac, represents the birth of a first love. Toji found some for me years ago, they're my favorites!"_  
"哦，那个不错，你能帮我拿一下吗，真嗣？" 光在心中说道。"紫丁香，代表初恋的诞生。几年前，阿薰帮我找到了一些，它们是我最喜欢的！"

A hawk's loud screech brought him back to the present. The flowers still rested innocently in Viko's hand.  
一声鹰的尖锐鸣叫将他拉回现实。花朵依旧无辜地躺在维科的手中。

"She's just going to throw them away. The Wunder's landing and everything," he said, mostly to himself. "It's stupid. She's…" _Asuka is not older than you,_ Hikari reprimanded. "She might hate it. I don't want to add to her stress of going to battle."  
"她会把它们扔掉的。奇迹号的着陆和一切，" 他 mostly to himself. "这很愚蠢。她……" 光责备道，"她不比你大多少。""她可能会讨厌这个。我不想增加她上战场的压力。"

"How in the hell is a gift supposed to add stress?" Viko rebuked, and gave his shoulder a playful punch. "Regardless of how tough she is, Major Shikinami is still a girl. And girls like flowers. So, lilacs. Yay or nay?"  
"这礼物怎么可能增加压力？" 维克反驳道，并开玩笑地捶了一下他的肩膀。"不管她有多坚强，式波少校毕竟还是个女孩。而女孩喜欢花。所以，紫丁香。赞成还是反对？"

_Indecision. Cowardice. Hesitation. Build, Shinji. Work, help, make Asuka smile. No matter what.  
犹豫不决。怯懦。迟疑。建立起来，真嗣。工作，帮助，让明日香微笑。无论如何。_

"Yeah," he answered at last. "Thank you."  
"嗯，" 他终于回答道。"谢谢你。"

With an enthusiastic nod, Viko took the bouquet from his hold and added the last touches. "Now remember, keep the vase safe, and make sure to water them at least once a day."  
Viko 热情地点了点头，从他手中接过花束，添上最后的点缀。“现在记住，保持花瓶安全，并确保每天至少浇一次水。”

"Uhm, Viko," he started. The man raised an eyebrow, it was the first time Shinji called him by his name. "What do you do when you're scared, and can't seem to make up your mind?"  
“嗯，Viko，”他开口道。男人挑了挑眉，这是 Shinji 第一次叫他的名字。“当你害怕，又似乎无法下定决心时，你会怎么做？”

"Hmm, when I'm scared? I think of things that inspire bravery in me." Viko pointed to the desert stretching before them, at a very specific point on the horizon. "I think of my brother, because he would've faced a tiger bare-handed to protect me. I think of Ryoji, and how I must always make sure he's safe." He laughed all of the sudden, and collapsed on the grass, cross-legged. "Doesn't mean I'm not scared, though."  
“嗯，当我害怕时？我会想一些能激励我勇敢的事物。”Viko 指向他们面前延伸的沙漠，在遥远的地平线上某个特定的点。“我会想到我的哥哥，因为他会赤手空拳面对一只老虎来保护我。我会想到 Ryoji，以及我必须始终确保他的安全。”他突然笑了起来，盘腿坐在草地上。“但这并不意味着我不害怕。”

Shinji rummaged through the red jacket's pocket and produced the roundel. He so very desperately wanted to have the pirate insignia, as well. "And when you can't choose? If you know that whatever you do, somebody will be hurt?"  
真嗣在红色夹克的口袋里翻找，拿出了那个圆徽。他非常渴望也能拥有那个海盗徽章。“但如果你无法选择呢？如果你知道无论做什么，总会有人受伤呢？”

Viko's green eyes became unguarded once more. He felt it, the overwhelming sadness and horror, the guilt, and the empathy. "I ask myself what my brother would do, and I do the opposite of that."  
维科的绿眼睛再次变得毫无防备。他感受到了那种压倒性的悲伤和恐惧，还有内疚和同情。“我会问自己，我的兄弟会怎么做，然后我做相反的事。”

_My father can't be bothered to worry about anyone,_ Shinji thought, offering a nod_. He wouldn't care about casualties or anything, he'd do whatever was necessary to get his way. The opposite of that is…_  
真嗣心想，我的父亲根本不在乎任何人。他点了点头。父亲不会在乎伤亡或任何事情，他会不惜一切手段达到目的。与之相反的是……

"So, do I now climb into the Eva and fight?" he asked at last. It felt heavenly to say the question out loud.  
“那么，我现在要爬进 Eva 里战斗吗？”他终于问道。能大声说出这个问题，感觉真是太好了。

"Yes." Viko replied. “是的。”Viko 回答道。

Shinji's head perked up. 真嗣的头抬了起来。

"No." "不行。"

He groaned. 他呻吟了一声。

"It's up to you, in the end." Viko nodded towards the forest. "Nobody will judge you or hate you, whatever you choose."  
“最终，这取决于你。”维科朝森林点了点头。“无论你选择什么，都不会有人评判你或憎恨你。”

_Craft. Fight. Help. Grow. Nurture. Atone. Build, Shinji._ "I know it may not seem like it, but-" His hands curled into fists. "I've been trying to find a way to help… to fight, for weeks."  
创造。战斗。帮助。成长。培育。赎罪。建造吧，真嗣。“我知道这可能看起来不像，但是——”他的手握成了拳头。“我已经努力寻找帮助……战斗的方法，已经好几个星期了。”

"Of course you have," answered Viko quietly, looking down at his maimed fingers. "You feel guilt. You want redemption."  
“你当然有，”维科轻声回答，目光落在自己残缺的手指上。“你感到内疚。你渴望救赎。”

_Yes. If that were ever possible.  
是的。如果那有可能的话。_

Shinji looked at the waste beyond the L-barrier, at the many Wanderers that were gathering around the village. "I want to mend my mistakes."  
真嗣望着 L 屏障外的荒野，看着众多流浪者聚集在村庄周围。“我想弥补我的错误。”

The same maimed fingers gave his shoulder a reassuring squeeze. "The mistakes you have suffered for." Viko smiled. "Let's pretend there is no war. You're still here, but ominous power is granted to you. If you wish to restart everything, wipe the slate clean and make everyone forget what happened, you can. All possible outcomes are at your disposal. In that situation… what do you choose? What do _you_ want, Shinji?"  
那只同样伤残的手指在他肩上安慰地捏了一下。“那些你为之承受的错误。”Viko 微笑道，“让我们假装没有战争。你依然在这里，但被赋予了不祥的力量。如果你想重新开始一切，抹去过往，让所有人忘记发生的事，你可以做到。所有可能的结果都任你选择。在那种情况下……你会怎么选？你想要什么，真嗣？”

"_Not bad, you idiot,"_ Asuka's voice whispered in his memory. _"Not bad at all."_  
“还不赖，你这傻瓜，”明日香的声音在他记忆中低语，“一点也不赖。”

"Restart it all huh," Shinji mumbled with a shake of his head. "I think I just want to… live. With Asuka, if that were ever possible. If she'd-" he paused, gulping, "-let me. I want her to forgive me. I want to make it up to her for not being there." He thought of the penguins, the afternoons fishing, the smell of wet earth around the fields where Rei worked. "I want to read and cook and…" _and make her smile._ "It's stupid."  
“重新开始一切啊，”真嗣摇着头喃喃道，“我想我只是想……活下去。如果能和明日香在一起，如果她——”他顿了顿，咽了口唾沫，“——愿意让我。我希望她能原谅我。我想弥补我没有在她身边的过错。”他想起了那些企鹅，午后钓鱼的时光，Rei 工作的那片田野周围湿润泥土的气息。“我想读书、烹饪和……”让她微笑。“这很傻。”

"Doesn't sound stupid to me, sounds like a fine goal." Viko replied. "If you keep trying, then maybe you'll have it. Step by step, little by little."  
"听起来并不愚蠢，倒是个不错的目标。" Viko 回答道。"如果你坚持不懈，或许就能实现。一步一步，一点一滴。"

"Suddenly you find yourself doing impossible things," Shinji intoned.  
"突然间，你会发现自己在做不可能的事，" 真嗣低声说道。"

"Right! These limes are pretty good, wouldn't you say so?" A ripe fruit fell on Shinji's free hand. "Do you know what I dream of, at times? What keeps me going through this hell? Heh, it's kind of dumb. My brother used to laugh whenever I told him, and Ryoji does too. Sometimes I simply wish for… heh…"  
"没错！这些青柠相当不错，你不觉得吗？" 一颗成熟的果实落在了真嗣空着的手上。"你知道我有时梦想什么吗？是什么让我在这地狱中坚持下去？嘿，有点傻。我哥哥每次听我说都会笑，亮司也一样。有时候我简单地希望……嘿……"

"A world where everyone can enjoy a nice, cold glass of lemonade."  
“一个每个人都能享受一杯清凉柠檬水的世界。”

Viko turned to him in surprise. "How do you know?"  
Viko 惊讶地转向他。“你怎么知道的？”

He smiled, recalling an easy smile brimming with confidence. "That's what keeps Ryoji going, too."  
他微笑着，回想起一个充满自信的轻松笑容。“这也是让凌司坚持下去的原因。”

---

_It's fading. I am fading away. Fade; to gradually grow faint and disappear.  
它在消逝。我正在逐渐消失。消逝；逐渐变得微弱并消失。_

Warm ocean breeze caressed her hair and skin, engulfed her body in a myriad of comforting sensations. The pain was gone due to the syringe Asuka had last gifted her. There was no nausea, nor did she feel confused or frightened. She felt tranquil instead, like the gentle waves crashing ashore.  
温暖的海洋微风轻抚着她的头发和肌肤，将她的身体包裹在无数抚慰的感觉中。由于明日香上次送给她的那支注射器，疼痛已经消失了。她没有恶心感，也不感到困惑或害怕。相反，她感到宁静，就像轻轻拍岸的海浪。

The entire huddle of penguins stood around in a semi-circle, with the leader standing beside her and occasionally glancing up. _They must surely sense it,_ Rei realized with a sad smile. She crouched and ruffled the feathers on the leader's head. _You are a most dedicated guardian. I thank you for looking after him. Please also look after her, if you can. She will say it is unnecessary, of course, but she will be grateful._  
一群企鹅围成半圆形站立，领头的站在她旁边，偶尔抬头看一眼。它们肯定能感觉到，丽意识到这一点，露出了悲伤的微笑。她蹲下身子，揉了揉领头企鹅头上的羽毛。你是一位非常尽责的守护者。感谢你照顾他。如果可以的话，也请照顾她。她当然会说这是不必要的，但她会感激的。

"Two more months until the rice yields," she told the bird. "Everything grows and withers at its own pace."  
“再过两个月稻米就成熟了，”她对鸟儿说，“万物生长凋零，皆有其时。”

Moist feathers pressed against her as the leader squeaked its approval. _Will you remember me, as well? I hope so._  
湿润的羽毛紧贴着她，领头的鸟儿吱吱叫着表示同意。你会记得我吗？我希望如此。

Her senses were keen and dialed to their maximum at their last moments, so the presence manifesting beside her came as an absolute shock. She heard no footsteps nor saw any movement, and yet a figure stood next to Rei after what felt like a blink.  
她的感官在最后一刻敏锐至极，因此身边突然出现的存在让她完全震惊。她既没听到脚步声，也没看到任何移动，但就在一眨眼的工夫，一个人影站在了丽身旁。

"A red dawn today," Viko whispered. He presented a marvelous, sweet smelling bouquet of tiny blue flowers to her. "Forget-me-nots," he explained. "My brother's favorites."  
“今早的日出是红色的，”维科低声说道。他递给她一束美妙的小蓝花，香气甜美。“勿忘我，”他解释道，“我哥哥最喜欢的花。”

Rei smiled, holding the flowers close. "Was your brother a good man, like Mr. Suzuhara or Mr. Aida?"  
丽微笑着，将花束紧抱在怀中。“你的哥哥是个好人吗，像铃原先生或相田先生那样？”

The penguins jumped in surprise at the sudden howl of laughter, and only then did Rei realize they had also not reacted to the man's approach.  
企鹅们被突如其来的笑声吓了一跳，直到那时，丽才意识到它们也没有对那个男人的接近做出反应。

"No," Viko said in between barks of mirth. "Quite the opposite in fact."  
"不，" Viko 在笑声中插话道，"实际上恰恰相反。"

Gendo Ikari's figure flashed through her mind. "But he loved you, did he not?"  
碇源堂的身影在她脑海中闪过。"但他爱你，不是吗？"

"Yes." "是的。"

_Hope,_ she mused. _A feeling of expectation, and a desire for certain things to happen._  
希望，她沉思着。一种期待的感觉，以及对某些事情发生的渴望。

"In the end, did he try to be a good man?" she asked.  
“最终，他是否努力成为一个好人？”她问道。

A pause. Viko's gaze drifted to the sky, then back to her. "Yes."  
一阵沉默。维科的目光飘向天空，然后又回到她身上。“是的。”

She nodded, walking over to Shinji's kitchen and carefully placing the bouquet on the cup she had crafted for him. "What was his name? Perhaps I will meet him soon."  
她点点头，走到真嗣的厨房，小心翼翼地将花束放在她为他制作的那只杯子上。“他叫什么名字？也许我很快就会见到他。”

Viko laughed again. His voice mingled with a crashing wave. "I have a feeling he would've liked you," he said, turning away. "Much like Shinji, he always had an eye for beauty."  
维科再次笑了起来。他的声音与汹涌的波浪交织在一起。“我有种感觉，他会喜欢你的，”他转身说道，“就像真嗣一样，他总是能发现美。”

---

_Beautiful.  美丽。_

His mouth was dry despite the many gulps of lemonade and water. His pulse had not settled for well over two days, shortening every breath as he walked. It took every bit of concentration to keep the vase steady and out of sight. _You're… beautiful. I just wanted to say that, because I don't know if I'll ever have the chance again._  
"尽管喝了许多柠檬水和清水，他的嘴巴依然干燥。脉搏已经持续两天多没有平复，每走一步呼吸都变得急促。他全神贯注地稳住花瓶，不让它被人看见。你……很美。我只是想这么说，因为我不确定是否还有机会再告诉你。”

"No, that's lame," Shinji muttered. "She's been quiet lately."  
“不，那太逊了，”真嗣咕哝道，“她最近一直很安静。”

The morning had gifted him with the sight of a flushed Asuka pushing him away in a haste and marching over to the room. _She fell sleep,_ he words felt triumphant in some way. _She looked so… calm, like she was having a good dream._  
清晨赐予了他一幕：脸颊泛红的明日香急匆匆地推开他，大步走向房间。她睡着了，他的话语在某种程度上显得胜利了。她看起来那么……平静，仿佛正做着好梦。

"I wanted to give these to you." The vase was pushed towards an invisible, glaring redhead. "You can throw them away if you like. I know it's a stupid thing, because they'll just wither away, anyway. But…"  
“我想把这些给你。”花瓶被推向一个看不见的、怒目而视的红发女孩。“如果你愿意，可以扔掉它们。我知道这是件蠢事，因为它们终究会枯萎。但是……”

_But what, Idiot?_ A single caerulean eye narrowed. _Spit it out._  
但什么，傻瓜？一只蔚蓝色的眼睛眯了起来。说出来吧。

"I think I like you."  
“我想我喜欢你。”

Something was amiss. The declaration felt honest and heartfelt, so what was the problem? _It feels natural,_ Shinji discovered as the ruins came into view. _It's like saying plants need water to survive, or that the sky is blue in the village. I like you, Asuka. I don't care about any curse, or about staying like this forever. That just means I'll be able to make up for these fourteen years. This 'curse', I'm grateful for it._  
有些不对劲。这番表白听起来真诚而发自内心，那么问题出在哪里呢？当废墟映入眼帘时，真嗣发现这种感觉很自然。就像说植物需要水才能生存，或者村子里的天空是蓝色的一样自然。我喜欢你，明日香。我不在乎什么诅咒，也不在乎永远这样下去。那只是意味着我能弥补这十四年的时光。这个‘诅咒’，我甚至感激它。

"Horrible, horrible. That'll make her angry," Shinji kicked a nearby pebble out the way. Frustration began to settle in once a seventy-sixth speech was rendered useless and discarded. "Everybody says to just be honest. Be honest, and sound like an idiot. Like a _brat_. Ugh."  
"糟糕透顶，糟糕透顶。这会让她生气的，" 真嗣踢开附近的一颗小石子。当第七十六次尝试表达都以失败告终并被抛弃时，挫败感开始蔓延。"大家都说要诚实。诚实，然后听起来像个傻瓜。像个孩子。唉。"

Different scenarios kept playing in his mind with such intensity that he barely registered reaching his first destination. The vase was hidden away in a corner near the ration center. Once he reached the ruins and went to pick up his fishing rod, Shinji saw the blue flowers resting on the cup Rei had gifted him.  
不同的情景在他脑海中不断重演，如此强烈以至于他几乎没意识到自己已经到达了第一个目的地。花瓶被藏在配给中心附近的一个角落里。当他到达废墟并准备拿起他的钓竿时，真嗣看到了那些蓝色的花朵，它们静静地躺在丽送给他的杯子上。

"I remember these," he whispered. His fingers caressed the small petals, instantly recalling big crimson eyes staring at him fondly, a gentle smile and strands of blue dancing in the wind. "Forget-me-nots."  
"我记得这些，" 他低声说道。他的手指轻抚着细小的花瓣，立刻回想起那双大大的深红色眼睛温柔地注视着他，一个温柔的微笑和随风飘动的蓝色发丝。"勿忘我。"

"They symbolize respect, fidelity, and true love."  
"它们象征着尊敬、忠诚和真爱。"

Shinji turned to see Rei standing a few feet from him. How had he not seen her before? "Rei!" he exclaimed. "They're beautiful! Are they… uhm.. f-for m-"  
真嗣转头看到丽站在几步之外。他之前怎么没注意到她？“丽！”他惊呼道，“它们真美！这些是……呃……是给……”

"Yes," she interjected softly. "They are for you. Miss Horaki explained that this is a fine gift to those you hold dear."  
“是的，”她轻声打断道，“它们是给你的。碇司令解释说，这是对珍视之人表达敬意的珍贵礼物。”

Blood rushed to Shinji's face instantly. "Thank you," he offered with a nervous bow. "I… don't really know what to say. Nobody's ever given me flowers before."  
血液瞬间涌上了真嗣的脸颊。“谢谢你，”他紧张地鞠了一躬，“我……真的不知道该说什么。从来没有人送过我花。”

"Then, I am glad to be the first to do so," Rei answered, smile broadening. "I will remember you always, Shinji."  
“那么，我很高兴成为第一个这样做的人，”绫波回答道，笑容更加灿烂，“我会永远记住你的，真嗣。”

Only then did Shinji notice how heavy the air had become. His chest constricted. An invisible fist dug into his guts. "Remember? What do you mean?"  
直到那时，真嗣才注意到空气变得多么沉重。他的胸口紧缩，仿佛有一只无形的手紧紧抓住了他的内脏。“记住？你是什么意思？”

"I wanted to harvest the rice," she carried on. Shinji's chest filled with all-encompassing despair. "I wanted to see the Idiot and the Brat trees grow, and bear fruit. I wanted to hear Ryoji boast more about his watermelon field."  
"我想去收割稻米，"她继续说道。真嗣的胸中充满了绝望。"我想看到傻瓜树和小孩树长大，结出果实。我想听凌二再夸夸他的西瓜田。"

_Her plugsuit,_ Shinji's eyes widened in horror. _It was always black. Why is it… it's the same as Ayanami's._  
她的插入栓服，真嗣惊恐地瞪大了眼睛。它总是黑色的。为什么它……和绫波的一样。

Without Rei saying a word, he knew what was about to happen. "No," Shinji begged. His feet dragged closer to her. "No, wait."  
无需绫波开口，他就知道即将发生什么。"不，"真嗣恳求道。他的脚步拖向她。"不，等等。"

"I wanted to spend more time with the boy I like." Her eyes turned to the corner. Shinji's desperate gaze followed, noticing Asuka standing by the wall. For once, her eye displayed sadness. Rei smiled regardless. "I wanted to see Shinji smile more, and build more, and be happy with the Second Child. But what I have received is much greater."  
"我想和我喜欢的男孩多待一会儿。" 她的目光转向角落。真嗣绝望的目光随之而去，注意到明日香站在墙边。这一次，她的眼神流露出悲伤。绫波微笑依旧。"我想看到真嗣更多笑容，一起建造更多，与二号机驾驶员一起快乐。但我所得到的远比这更多。"

His hand was about to reach her when Asuka's arms snaked around his chest. He struggled under her hold. "Asuka! What are y-stop! Let me go! Let me g-"  
他的手即将触碰到她时，明日香的双臂缠绕在他的胸前。他在她的束缚下挣扎。"明日香！你这是干什么——停下！放开我！让我去——"

"Shinji, Asuka. Take care of each other." Rei said. He stropped struggling at once. "You are not alone, and that makes me happy." Her warm gaze fixed his. "Through the memories of those who love us, we never disappear. This is but a promise to see each other again." She closed her eyes, smile never leaving her calm features. "Goodbye."  
"真嗣，明日香。彼此照顾。" 绫波说道。他立刻停止了挣扎。"你们并不孤单，这让我感到高兴。" 她温暖的目光凝视着他。"通过爱我们的人的记忆，我们永远不会消失。这只是再次相见的承诺。" 她闭上眼睛，微笑始终未曾离开她平静的面容。"再见。"

The collar of Rei's plugsuit glistened, and a second afterwards her body burst into liquid form.  
丽驾驶服的领口闪着光，紧接着她的身体化作了一滩液体。

"Rei!" “丽！”

Asuka released him. Shinji dashed to the suit, still not able to fully digest what had happened. Once the dripping material was held in between his fingers, however, reality settled in. A tiny red cross shone atop the plugsuit for a few heartbeats, then faded with the breeze. She was gone.  
明日香放开了他。真嗣冲向那件驾驶服，仍无法完全理解发生了什么。然而，当他用手指夹住那滴水的布料时，现实终于沉甸甸地压了下来。驾驶服上一个小小的红色十字标志闪烁了几下心跳的时间，随后随风消逝。她已经不在了。

They remained quiet for a long time. The huddle of penguins encircled them, with the leader practically pushing Asuka forward until she stood next to him.  
他们沉默了许久。一群企鹅围拢在他们周围，领头的几乎是在推着明日香向前，直到她站在他旁边。

"I was going to play the song for her today," Shinji mumbled as bitter tears ran down his face. "I wanted to promise her we'd harvest the rice together, all of us…"  
“我今天本来要为她演奏那首歌的，”真嗣喃喃自语，苦涩的泪水顺着脸颊滑落。“我想向她承诺，我们大家会一起收割稻米……”

_Why? Why did this have to happen? Why did she just disappear like that?  
为什么？为什么会发生这种事？为什么她就这样消失了？_

"The Ayanami Series was purposely created to require constant exposure to LCL," Asuka explained, as though having read his mind. "She knew from the moment she climbed out of the Entry Plug that her time was limited. After a certain time, being so far from Lilith will corrode their bodies."  
“绫波系列从一开始就被设计成需要持续接触 LCL，”明日香解释道，仿佛看穿了他的心思。“她从踏出插入栓的那一刻起就知道自己的时间不多了。超过一定时间，远离莉莉丝会让她们的肉体逐渐腐蚀。”

"Could we have… could I have done something?" Shinji asked, desperate. "If the Wunder landed, if I tried to get Unit 01 to work and _get_ the LCL from my father, could I have-"  
“我们本可以……我能做些什么吗？”真嗣急切地问，“如果 Wunder 号降落，如果我尝试让 01 号机运作并从我父亲那里获取 LCL，我能——”

"Prolonged her life a little. Hours, days at best, but nothing could have stopped this. She was never meant to survive."  
“或许能延长她一点生命。几小时，最多几天，但无法阻止这一切。她本就不该活下来。”

Rage bristled in Shinji's ribcage, but quenched almost instantly as he realized just how low his father was willing to stoop. Seconds before, Rei's smile had been brightening the day, and now it lived only in his memory.  
愤怒在真嗣的胸腔中翻涌，但几乎瞬间就被浇灭，因为他意识到父亲愿意卑鄙到何种地步。就在几秒钟前，绫波的微笑还让这一天变得明亮，而现在，它只存在于他的记忆中。

"Come on." Asuka's hand gave his shoulder a solid pat. "There's still time until that hunk of junk lands. Let's go make sure she can watch the harvest."  
“走吧。”明日香的手在他肩上坚定地拍了一下。“那堆废铁落地还有时间。我们去确保她能看到收获。”

---

She carried the cup in silence, letting the scent ease a newly opened wound.  
她默默地端着杯子，让香气抚慰新添的伤口。

Kensuke walked beside her, with Hikari, Tsubame, Toji, Ryoji, Koga and most of the female workers in tow. Shinji walked ahead of the group with the folded plugsuit in his hold. He'd sniffle and rub at his eyes, yet did not break into tears again. Nobody spoke.  
健介走在她旁边，后面跟着光、燕、总司、凌二、古贺以及大部分女性工作人员。真嗣走在队伍前面，手里拿着折叠好的插入栓服。他时不时抽泣并揉揉眼睛，但没有再次哭出声来。没有人说话。

_Just when I was starting to feel something besides fatigue and anger,_ Asuka thought. Her gaze remained hard and unyielding. The idiot needed strength at the moment. There would be time aplenty to rage at Gendo Ikari soon_. Of course it would be like this. Have a taste of what living feels like, just so you can miss it, Asuka._  
就在我开始感受到除了疲惫和愤怒之外的情感时，明日香心想。她的目光依旧坚硬而不可动摇。那傻瓜此刻需要力量。很快就有足够的时间去向碇源堂发泄怒火。当然会是这样。让你尝尝生活的滋味，只是为了让你怀念它，明日香。

It came as a surprise that Shinji had not asked her of Rei's demise, and if she knew of it. _He's grown up,_ she realized. _Idiot figured out it wouldn't have made a difference. It would've just made him gloom around Rei._ The Major shook her head in derision. _Fool. Even then, you were protecting him. That's why it felt so disgusting to fight him. That's why you were so angry. Admit it._  
令人惊讶的是，真嗣并没有问她关于绫波的死讯，以及她是否知情。她意识到，他长大了。傻瓜明白那不会有什么区别。只会让他更加沉溺于对绫波的哀伤中。少校轻蔑地摇了摇头。蠢货。即便如此，你还是在保护他。这就是为什么和他战斗感觉如此恶心。这就是为什么你如此愤怒。承认吧。

"Maybe later," she murmured, too quietly for anyone to hear.  
“或许晚些时候吧，”她低声呢喃，轻得无人能听见。

The group came to a stop atop the hill where Shinji would sit and converse with Rei. The forest, mountains and rice fields stretched all around, with the scent of wet earth carrying through the wind. Toji and Kensuke started digging without being told to, and a new grave was erected in less time than she would have liked.  
一行人在山顶停下，那是真嗣常与绫波交谈的地方。森林、山脉和稻田环绕四周，湿润泥土的气息随风飘散。东治和健介未待吩咐便开始挖掘，一座新坟在比她期望更短的时间内立起。

After bowing their heads in prayer, the group began to dissipate. Ryoji gave Shinji a strong hug, and left a small watermelon sprout near the grave before running off. Tsubame's cries reverberated as the Horaki family walked away.  
祈祷后，众人开始散去。加持给了真嗣一个有力的拥抱，并在墓旁留下一株小西瓜苗，随即跑开。鸟美的哭声回荡，随着洞木一家渐行渐远。

"I can't help but feel this is all my fault. All she wanted was to be alive, to learn and be close to me," Shinji lamented quietly. "I guess it's like a curse with my father and I. Anyone who comes close… ends up getting hurt."  
"我忍不住觉得这都是我的错。她所希望的不过是活着，学习，靠近我，" 真嗣低声叹息。"我想这就像我和父亲之间的诅咒。任何靠近我们的人……最终都会受到伤害。"

"Getting hurt?" Asuka threw caution to the wind and slammed her fist hard against Shinji's shoulder. He almost topped over to the ground, and looked at her in shock. "That's what's going to happen if you start acting like a brat again. How do you think Rei would feel if she heard you sputter this nonsense right after she's gone, huh?"  
"受到伤害？" 明日香不顾一切地用力捶打真嗣的肩膀。他差点摔倒在地，震惊地看着她。"如果你再像个孩子一样胡闹，这就是后果。你觉得丽要是听到你刚走就胡言乱语，会怎么想？"

Agony and wrath were pressing against her own chest, quickly eclipsed by regret. Again, he surprised her; Shinji nodded, wiped away the remnants of tears from his eyes, and got to his feet.  
痛苦和愤怒压在她的胸口，很快被悔恨所掩盖。又一次，他让她惊讶；真嗣点点头，擦去眼角的泪水，站了起来。

"Thank you," he told her, offering a sad smile. "I needed that."  
"谢谢你，" 他向她道，露出一丝苦笑。"我正需要这个。"

"Whatever." Asuka turned away and started walking towards the village. "The ship's landing soon. I'm going."  
"随你便。" 明日香转身向村庄走去。"飞船马上就要着陆了。我要走了。"

She had already taken several steps when his voice halted Asuka in her tracks.  
她已经迈出了几步，这时他的声音让明日香停下了脚步。

"Asuka!" Shinji quickly caught up to her. "Wait up!"  
"明日香！" 真嗣迅速追上了她。"等等我！"

He could stay, be safe in the village and heal some more. He could watch over Rei grave and help Ryoji with the stupid watermelons. He could make sure the brat trees were not eaten by plagues. Everything would be easier if he just stayed. So why did hearing his footfalls make her feel so accomplished, even proud?  
他可以留下，在村子里安全地疗伤，照看丽子的墓，帮亮司处理那些愚蠢的西瓜。他可以确保那些小树苗不被病虫害侵袭。如果他留下，一切都会变得更容易。那么，为什么听到他的脚步声会让她感到如此成就感，甚至自豪呢？

"What?" She tried to summon some bite in her tone, to no avail. "There's about three hours left."  
"什么？" 她试图在语气中加入一些尖锐，但未能成功。"还剩下大约三个小时。"

"This won't take long, I hope," he replied. Asuka saw him play with something in his jacket pocket, and remembered it was where he kept the roundel lately. "I'd like to say my farewells to the penguins. I can't tell how many times they helped me get lunch, or dinner. Can I meet you by the ration center in a little while?"  
"希望这不会花太长时间，" 他回答道。明日香看到他在夹克口袋里摆弄着什么，想起来那是他最近存放圆形徽章的地方。"我想去跟企鹅们道个别。不知道有多少次它们帮我弄到了午餐或晚餐。一会儿我在补给中心那边等你，可以吗？"

"Creepy birds," Asuka grumbled, crossed her arms and huffed. "Not like it was me they were fond of. I have stuff to do. Wait, what do you mean, say your farewells? Where the hell are you talking about?"  
"这些讨厌的鸟，" 明日香咕哝着，交叉双臂，哼了一声。"又不是它们喜欢我。我还有事要做。等等，你说道别是什么意思？你到底在说什么地方？"

"I'd like to go with you." Shinji stated. They headed towards the village, side by side. "To the Wunder."  
"我想和你一起去。" 真嗣说道。他们并肩向村庄走去。"去 Wunder 号。"

Shaking her head in derision, Asuka pointed to his neck. "They're just going to put you in a cage. You should stay here."  
阿斯克摇着头嘲笑道，指向他的脖子。“他们只会把你关进笼子。你该留在这里。”

"You're probably right, but," he said. His voice was steel, determined and level. "I want to go with you, anyway."  
“你或许是对的，但是，”他说。他的声音坚定如钢，沉稳有力。“我还是想和你一起去。”

She bit her lip to suppress a smile. Shinji's resolve felt like water being poured on the seed of hope that grew within her soul. "Heh." Asuka gave his shoulder a light push. "You're an idiot."  
她咬住嘴唇，强忍笑意。真嗣的决心仿佛浇灌在她灵魂深处希望之种的水，让它茁壮成长。“哼。”阿斯克轻轻推了推他的肩膀。“你真是个傻瓜。”

"But not a brat?" "但不是个孩子吧？"

_Not anymore, you're not,_ Asuka thought. "We'll see," she said instead. "I need to go pick up a few things at the house. See you in thirty minutes."  
不再是了，你不再是了，明日香心想。 "我们走着瞧，"她改口道。 "我得回家拿几样东西。三十分钟后见。"

Shinji set up to the ruins after trying to offer a smile and failing. "Tch, stupid grumpy bird," grumbled Asuka. "Still don't know what its problem was."  
真嗣勉强挤出一个微笑，却失败了，然后走向废墟。 "哼，愚蠢的暴躁鸟，"明日香咕哝道。 "还是不知道它到底有什么问题。"

Heading back to the old train station was inevitable. The dictionary, jacket and her own roundel were still there. _Don't forget about your pathetic little plush toy, either,_ rasped the Major snidely. _We're walking to our funeral with the idiot in tow, best to take your stupid good luck charm along, eh?_  
回到旧火车站是不可避免的。字典、夹克和她的徽章都还在那里。别忘了你那可怜的小毛绒玩具，少校刻薄地嘀咕道。我们带着那个白痴走向自己的葬礼，最好还是带上你那愚蠢的幸运符，嗯？

The book and jacket were easy to find, always in the place above the sheets where Shinji left them. Asuka took several glances left and right, closed her eye and heard for any noise before producing one of the clay cups from the military coat. Rummaging through the old closet, she found a school shirt left behind almost a decade before, and used it to wrap the cup and plush safely.  
书和夹克很容易找到，总是在真嗣留下的床单上方。明日香左右看了几眼，闭上眼睛聆听任何声响，然后从军装外套中取出一只陶杯。她在旧衣柜里翻找，找到了一件近十年前留下的校服衬衫，用它将杯子和毛绒玩具安全地包裹起来。

_Where is it?_ Her eye narrowed, nostrils flaring. After checking the house twice and flipping over the mattress, one object was still missing. _Where is my roundel? I swear, if that idiot had the nerve to take it, I'll be-_  
它在哪里？她的眼睛眯起，鼻孔张开。检查了房子两次并翻转了床垫后，仍有一个物品不见了。我的徽章呢？我发誓，如果那个白痴有胆量拿走它，我一定会——

"Looking for this?" “在找这个吗？”

Kensuke said from the door. Asuka stopped in her tracks and glared at the village leader. He held that old camera of his in his right hand, and in his left, the small medal Shinji longed to earn.  
健介在门口说道。明日香停下脚步，瞪着村长。他右手拿着那台旧相机，左手则握着真嗣渴望获得的小奖章。

Self-consciousness made her turn away. "Why are you filming me? What the hell?"  
羞涩感让她转过身去。“你为什么拍我？搞什么鬼？”

"It's an important day for mankind!" Kensuke answered. "I want to have video footage of our heroes. Is that so wrong?"  
"今天是人类的重要日子！" 真希回答道，"我想记录下我们的英雄。这有什么错吗？"

"Yeah right." She hid her face under the hoodie. "Whatever, _Ken-Ken_."  
"是啊，没错。" 她把脸藏在连帽衫下，"随你怎么说，真希。"

To her satisfaction, Kensuke's step faltered at the venom in her voice. "If something… bad were to happen," he expressed with a quieter, somber tone. "I'd like to have a little memento of the people I care about."  
令她满意的是，真希的脚步因她话语中的恶意而踉跄了一下。"如果发生了什么……不好的事，" 他用更轻柔、沉重的语气说道，"我希望有一些我关心的人的纪念品。"

"Ugh, _fine_." Asuka faced the camera lens and strained to keep her glare, yet it melted in seconds. _He's right. This could be the last time we see each other._ "Make sure the barrier stands as long as possible. The battle will be far from here, but those Wanderers keep coming closer."  
"唉，好吧。" 明日香面对着摄像头，努力维持着她的怒视，但几秒钟就瓦解了。他说得对。这可能是我们最后一次见面了。"确保屏障尽可能长时间地维持。战斗会离这里很远，但那些流浪者不断逼近。"

"I'll keep them safe as best I can, that's a promise. I know you'll protect us. You always do." Kensuke produced a letter and handed it over along with the roundel. "From Toji, for Sakura. Can you do an old man a favor and give this to her? Maybe it'll help her state of mind."  
"我会尽我所能保护他们，这是我的承诺。我知道你会保护我们。你一直都在。" 健介拿出了一封信，连同圆盘一起递了过去。"这是给樱的，来自总司。你能帮个忙，把这个交给她吗？也许能帮她稳定情绪。"

"Fat chance of that," Asuka responded. She pocketed both objects, allowing a small, honest smile to slip off her mask. "Thanks. For everything."  
"那可难说，" 明日香回应道。她把两样东西放进口袋，脸上露出了一个真诚的小微笑。"谢谢。为了这一切。"

"It was my honor, Shikinami." They exchanged a heartfelt handshake and a brief embrace. "Told you he'd go with you," the man teased. "Can you stop being angry with me now?"  
"这是我的荣幸，式波。" 他们交换了一个真挚的握手和一个短暂的拥抱。"我告诉过你他会跟你走的，" 那人打趣道。"你现在能不再生我的气了吗？"

Asuka pushed him away and crossed her arms. "Can you tell me _why_ I'm angry with you?"  
明日香推开他，交叉双臂。"你能告诉我为什么我生你的气吗？"

"Shinji could have easily gotten hurt, or lost his life in that stupid incident," Kensuke replied. "That kitchen, those cups, it was like a small shrine. Somewhere sacred, somewhere you felt at home, and it was almost tainted because of my stupidity."  
"真嗣在那次愚蠢的事件中很容易受伤，甚至丧命，" 健介回答道。"那个厨房，那些杯子，就像一个小小的神龛。一个神圣的地方，一个让你感到自在的地方，却差点因为我的愚蠢而被玷污。"

"Guess you're not as dumb as you look." Asuka nodded, turning to the car. "I need a ride to the village. Move it, you."  
"看来你并不像外表那么傻。" 明日香点头，转向汽车。"我需要搭车去村子。快点，你。"

"Aye, aye, Major." "遵命，少校。"

Before leaving the house, Asuka carefully stored the dictionary and jacket in her bag. The last word Shinji had underlined in red rang on her mind. _Bond,_ she mused. _To form a close relation, a strong feeling of friendship, love, or shared beliefs and experiences that unites two or more people._  
离开房子之前，明日香小心翼翼地将字典和夹克放入背包。真嗣最后用红笔划出的那个词在她脑海中回响。联结，她沉思着。建立一种紧密的关系，一种强烈的友情、爱情或共享的信念和经历，将两个人或多个人紧密相连。

---

"It's just a little while. Just a second, okay? No need to worry! I'll be right back. What do you mean, it's dangerous? You raised me! I'll be fine!"  
"只是稍等一会儿。就一秒钟，好吗？不用担心！我马上就回来。你说危险是什么意思？你把我养大的！我会没事的！"

Ryoji argued with nobody as he sprinted towards the back of the ship. The letter he had left on the table was detailed enough; Viko would understand. The man rambled endlessly about his own big brother, yet rarely said a word about his parents.  
凌司对着空无一人的地方争辩着，同时向船尾疾奔而去。他在桌上留下的信已经足够详细；维科会明白的。这个男人总是喋喋不休地谈论他的大哥，却很少提及他的父母。

"_My mother was very pretty and sweet, that's about all I remember. They died when I was still very young."_  
"我记得我妈妈非常漂亮和温柔，其他的就不太记得了。他们在我很小的时候就去世了。"

"Well, my mother is still alive and kicking, and I am sure as hell gonna give her a piece of my mind," he muttered with determination. "Whether she likes it or not, I'm gonna give her a piece of my mind. Yeah."  
“好吧，我妈还活蹦乱跳的，我他妈一定要让她知道我的想法，”他坚定地喃喃自语，“不管她喜不喜欢，我都要让她明白我的意思。没错。”

The ship came into view, so Ryoji crouched like Viko had taught him and began to maneuver through the tall grass and vegetation, hidden from sight. There was a small gap in the security detail handling the seeds. If he timed everything correctly, he could sneak in without anyone noticing.  
船只映入眼帘，于是 Ryoji 按照 Viko 教他的那样蹲下身子，开始在茂密的草丛和植被中穿梭，隐蔽起来。安保人员在处理种子时有一个小空隙。如果他一切计算得当，就能神不知鬼不觉地潜入。

"Twenty-seven, twenty- eight," he counted in a whisper. "Twenty-eight seconds between every turn of the guard. Just need a little head star-"  
“二十七，二十八，”他低声数着，“每二十八秒守卫会转一次身。只需要一点点的运气——”

"Hey, what's up." "嘿，怎么了。"

Ryoji almost jumped in shock, which would have given away his position. "Viko, what the hell…!" he whispered tersely. "What are you doing here?"  
凌司几乎吓得跳了起来，这差点暴露了他的位置。“维科，搞什么鬼…！”他急促地低声说道，“你在这里做什么？”

"What are _you_ doing here, hmm?" His guardian rebuked, pointing to his backpack. "That's mine, I never said you could borrow it."  
“你在这里做什么，嗯？”他的监护人责备道，指着他的背包，“那是我的，我可没说过你可以借走。”

"Come on, don't do this," Ryoji argued in an almost pleading tone. "Don't take this away from me. You… you have no right to!" Anger quickly settled in, and all notions of being spotted were forgotten. "This is my one chance! You can't possibly underst-"  
"别这样，别这么做，" 莲司几乎恳求地说道。"别夺走这个机会。你……你没有权利这么做！" 愤怒迅速涌上心头，所有被发现的顾虑都被抛诸脑后。"这是我唯一的机会！你不可能理解——"

"I understand perfectly," Viko interrupted him, and drew Ryoji into a fierce embrace. "I'm not here to stop you. I just wanted to see you off."  
"我完全理解，" 维克打断了他，将莲司紧紧拥入怀中。"我不是来阻止你的。我只是想送送你。"

Relief washed over. Ryoji's arms wrapped around Viko's and squeezed as tight as he could. "Thank you," he said. "You're the best brother anyone could ever hope for. I'll be right back, okay? Then we'll have dinner, and joke about how Shinji finally had the guts to give Asuka those flowers. How's that?"  
松了一口气。莲司的双臂环绕着维克，尽可能地紧抱着他。"谢谢你，" 他说。"你是我能希望拥有的最好的兄弟。我很快就会回来，好吗？然后我们一起吃晚饭，聊聊真嗣终于有勇气给明日香送花的笑话。怎么样？"

Viko's body trembled, raising all sorts of alarms in his head. All too late did Ryoji realize the arm slowly sneaking around his neck, or the way his airway constricted. He tried to struggle and break free, but only managed to sink deeper into the submission hold.  
Viko 的身体颤抖着，在他脑海中拉响了各种警报。直到为时已晚，Ryoji 才意识到那只缓缓绕过他脖子的手臂，或是他的气道是如何被勒紧的。他试图挣扎和挣脱，却只是陷入了更深的压制之中。

"I'm sorry, Ryoji." Viko murmured. "But I already lost a brother, and I'm not losing you. You will meet your mother, you have my word."  
“对不起，Ryoji。”Viko 低声说道，“但我已经失去了一个兄弟，不能再失去你。你一定会见到你的母亲，我保证。”

The boy's body went limp in seconds. Viko handed him over to Toji, wiping away the tears. "Watch over my trees, will you? They like to be serenated at night, when the weather's good."  
男孩的身体在几秒钟内就瘫软了。Viko 将他交给了 Toji，擦去泪水。“帮我照看我的树，好吗？它们喜欢在天气好的时候被夜曲抚慰。”

"I'll do my best, although my singing leaves a lot to be desired," Toji answered. "What's your actual name?"  
"我会尽力的，虽然我的歌声还有很大提升空间，" 冬二回答道。"你的真名是什么？"

"Does it matter?" Viko laughed, gathered the backpack Ryoji had been carrying and headed to the ship. "It's like saying the title 'Second' or 'Third Child' matter. I'm Viko. That's the name my home gave me."  
"这重要吗？" 维克笑着，接过加持背着的背包，向飞船走去。"就像说'第二适格者'或'第三适格者'有什么意义一样。我是维克。这是我家乡给我的名字。"

The man's figure disappeared behind tall grass and trees, as though he'd never been there at all.  
那人的身影消失在高高的草丛和树木之后，仿佛他从未存在过一样。

"We all believe in you, Shinji." Toji placed the unconscious boy on his back, and started walking back to the village. The battle was about to begin. "Even Asuka, more than you can possibly know."  
“我们都相信你，真嗣。” 冬二将失去意识的男孩背在背上，开始向村庄走去。战斗即将开始。“就连明日香也是，比你所能想象的还要多。”

Just as the children and elders were safely inside the shelter, a rumble shook all of Village-3.  
就在孩子们和老人安全进入避难所时，村子三号突然震动起来。

Unit 01 had awakened. 初号机苏醒了。

---

The relentless wind outside the barrier could be heard from afar.  
屏障外无情的狂风从远处就能听见。

Shinji's head turned to the sky for a moment, watching stoically as one section of the barrier lowered for barely enough time for a large ship to make port. Many of the wooden radio poles collapsed under the ferocious currents coming from both the engines and tremors shaking the earth. He shielded the delicate bundle with his back and braced behind a wall to keep it unharmed.  
真嗣的头短暂地转向天空，肃然注视着屏障的一角缓缓降下，仅够一艘大船靠岸。许多木制无线电杆在来自引擎和地震的猛烈气流下纷纷倒塌。他用背部护住那脆弱的包裹，紧靠在墙后以确保其安全无损。

From afar, he saw Asuka step down from the one tower sturdy enough to resist the landing. _This is it, Rei. Kaworu. Ayanami. Give me strength,_ he pleaded. If he stopped focusing on the task at hand, grief was sure to consume him. _One last chance to make her smile. Once you climb on that ship, everything will change. You have to be ready for it, you have to be strong. Earn. Earn, Shinji._  
从远处，他看到明日香从那座坚固到足以抵抗降落的塔楼上走下。这就是了，绫波，薰，绫波。请赐予我力量，他在心中祈求。如果他停止专注于手头的任务，悲伤必定会吞噬他。最后一次让她微笑的机会。一旦登上那艘船，一切都将改变。你必须为此做好准备，你必须坚强。争取。争取，真嗣。

"I'm not blind, idiot," Asuka said from behind him. Her voice shocked him to the point of almost dropping the vase. She pointed to the landing dock. "My ride's here. Are you coming or not?"  
“我又不是瞎子，笨蛋，”明日香在他身后说道。她的声音吓得他差点把手中的花瓶掉在地上。她指向着陆码头。“我的车到了。你到底来不来？”

"I am," he mumbled, took a deep breath and faced her. "This is for you." He measuredly walked towards her. "I just…" Extending the gift to her, Shinji finally managed a smile. "I felt like giving these to you."  
“我来了，”他咕哝着，深吸了一口气，面对着她。“这是给你的。”他小心翼翼地走向她。“我只是……”将礼物递给她，真嗣终于挤出了一个微笑。“我觉得应该把这些给你。”

Asuka's gaze switched from surprise, to suspicion and finally settled in light amusement. She practically snatched the vase from him and shifted away so the eyepatch was facing him. Even so, he saw it. She smiled.  
明日香的目光从惊讶转为怀疑，最终停留在淡淡的笑意上。她几乎是抢过花瓶，转身让眼罩对着他。即便如此，他还是看到了。她笑了。

_Victory.  胜利。_

"Idiot," Asuka rasped. Her fingers brusquely traced the petals, then gently placed the vase on the ground. "Come here."  
“白痴，”明日香嘶哑地说道。她的手指粗鲁地抚过花瓣，然后轻轻将花瓶放在地上。“过来。”

Shinji did as instructed, and almost jolted out of his own skin when Asuka's arm circled around him and pushed them into a half-hug. "Uhm, I…" His arm awkwardly wrapped around her shoulders. After a few tense heartbeats, he relaxed and melted into the embrace. "I think I lik-"  
真嗣照做了，当明日香的手臂环住他，将两人推入一个半拥抱时，他几乎吓了一跳。“呃，我……”他的手臂尴尬地环绕在她的肩膀上。经过几下紧张的心跳后，他放松下来，融入了这个拥抱。“我想我喜——”

"You're still coming, right?" Asuka interjected softly, breaking away. He nodded despite the dread building in his core. The taser pressed against Shinji's stomach. "Save that for later, then."  
"你还是会来的，对吧？" 明日香轻声插话，打破了沉默。尽管内心恐惧逐渐加剧，他还是点了点头。电击枪抵在真嗣的腹部。"那就留到以后再用吧。"

A pair of scalding needles pressed against his abdomen, releasing a massive shockwave. Shinji's body convulsed and his eyes closed, yet he never felt himself hit the ground.  
一对滚烫的针尖抵在他的腹部，释放出巨大的冲击波。真嗣的身体猛烈抽搐，双眼闭合，但他从未感觉到自己倒地。

### Chapter 9 Soul Rebel
The smell of oil and fuel welcomed Shinji back to consciousness.  
机油和燃油的气味将真嗣唤醒。

All around him, footfalls and screaming orders drowned out his disoriented thoughts. The skin of his midsection burned, his muscles spasmed. His mind was a fog. However, the bright smile before everything went dark was still clear.  
四周脚步声和尖锐的命令声淹没了他混乱的思绪。他腹部皮肤灼热，肌肉痉挛。他的思绪一片迷雾。然而，在一切陷入黑暗之前那灿烂的微笑依然清晰。

Somebody was speaking close to his ear, the voice a little more than a distant mumble. The figure cleared as his eyes adjusted. "-it's a damn hazard! I don't understand!"  
有人在他耳边说话，声音模糊不清。随着他眼睛适应，身影变得清晰。"“这简直是胡闹！我不明白！”

"You don't have to understand, only do as you're told." A familiar voice retorted. "What are you, his wife or something?"  
“你不需要明白，只需照吩咐做。”一个熟悉的声音反驳道，“你以为你是他老婆还是什么？”

_Asuka,_ Shinji thought. _She sounds angry._  
明日香，真嗣心想。她听起来很生气。

His mouth was dry. The fluorescent light above almost burned his retinas. At last, the features cleared. "Miss Sakura?" he mumbled. "Sakura Suzuhara?"  
他的嘴巴干涩。头顶的荧光灯几乎灼伤了他的视网膜。终于，面容清晰起来。“樱小姐？”他含糊地问道，“铃原樱？”

A slap cleared his hazy mind.  
一记耳光让他昏沉的头脑清醒过来。

"I said don't pilot the Eva!" Sakura said in a broken voice. "You absolute jerk! You're such a jerk, Ikari!"  
"我说了不要驾驶 Eva！" 樱带着破碎的声音说道，"你这个彻头彻尾的混蛋！你真是个混蛋，碇！"

She reared for another strike, but Asuka's hand caught her wrist. "Captain's property, Suzuhara. You don't get to damage it without her permission. Here," Asuka said. She produced a letter from her jacket. "From your idiot brother. Maybe it'll calm you down. Run along."  
她再次准备攻击，但明日香的手抓住了她的手腕。"这是舰长的东西，铃原。没有她的允许，你不能随便破坏。来，"明日香说着，从夹克里拿出了一封信，"这是你那笨蛋哥哥的信。也许能让你冷静下来。快走吧。"

With a last hateful side glance, Sakura ripped the letter from Asuka's grip and hurried off to one of the many halls. _It's not just Sakura,_ Shinji realized. There was movement all around them, sailors carried boxes and packages and constantly yelled instructions. Regardless, most spared a few seconds to glower in his general direction.  
带着最后一瞥的恨意，樱从明日香手中夺过信，匆匆走向众多走廊中的一条。真嗣意识到，不仅仅是樱。他们周围到处都是动静，水手们搬运着箱子和包裹，不停地大声下达指令。尽管如此，大多数人还是抽出几秒钟时间，向他投来愤怒的目光。

"Rules are rules," Asuka said. Her voice was terse, deadly. "Tried to set the stupid taser on the lowest setting. Can you sit up?"  
"规则就是规则，" 明日香说道。她的声音简短而致命。"试着把那愚蠢的电击枪调到最低档。你能坐起来吗？"

_She's furious,_ Shinji thought. _But not with me. She's not angry with Sakura, either._  
她很生气，真嗣想。但不是对我。她也没有对樱生气。

"I think so," he said. Pain erupted from his midsection, as spasms continued to run up and down his body. "Just, give me a second-"  
"我想可以，" 他说。疼痛从他的腹部爆发，痉挛继续在他的身体上下蔓延。"只是，给我一点时间-"

"We don't have a second." Asuka hoisted him to a sitting position, refusing to meet his gaze. She placed a battered bento box on his lap. "Didn't have time to make anything interesting. Laugh and I'll hit you in the face. Now eat, you'll need the strength."  
"我们没有时间了。" 明日香将他扶成坐姿，拒绝与他目光相接。她把一个破旧的便当盒放在他腿上。"没时间做有趣的东西了。敢笑我就揍你。现在吃吧，你需要力气。"

Despite the clear threat, Shinji chuckled. _Fish and rice_. "Thank you," he said. His stomach grumbled, and every bite he took lessened the tremors. "The fish is delicious. I'm getting a bit of rosemary aftertaste. Viko's limes?"  
尽管有明显的威胁，真嗣还是轻笑出声。鱼和米饭。"谢谢你，"他说。他的肚子咕咕叫，每一口都减轻了颤抖。"鱼很好吃。我尝到了一点迷迭香的后味。是维科的青柠吗？"

"Duh, where else would I get them?"  
"废话，不然还能是哪儿的？"

"Right." The rice was crunchy, spiked with a bit of soy sauce. "How long have I been asleep?"  
"好的。" 米饭有点硬，带着一丝酱油味。"我睡了多久？"

"About an hour, give or take. The Wunder hasn't launched yet," Asuka replied. She crossed her arms, and only then did Shinji catch a slight glimpse of lilac hanging from her jacket pocket. "Still got some time before things turn hectic."  
"大约一小时，上下浮动一点。Wunder 号还没起飞，" 明日香回答道。她交叉双臂，这时真嗣才注意到她夹克口袋上挂着一抹淡紫色。"离事情变得混乱还有些时间。"

_This isn't hectic? Damn._ The rest of the crew gave them ample space, he realized, and some of the glares lingered on Asuka as well. His fist clenched. _A soldier. A freak bred for war._  
这还不算混乱？该死。他意识到其他船员给了他们足够的空间，有些目光也停留在明日香身上。他的拳头紧握。一个士兵。一个为战争而生的怪物。

"How long do you think we have until we reach my father?" Shinji asked.  
“你觉得我们还有多久能到我父亲那儿？”真嗣问道。

"_We_?" Asuka lifted an amused eyebrow. "Couple of days at best."  
“我们？”明日香挑起眉毛，带着一丝戏谑。“最多也就几天吧。”

The tracksuit was gone, Shinji noted while trying to store the bento. He had been redressed in the same old school uniform Unit 01 had spat him out with. For so long those clothes had felt like a second skin. Now it felt foreign, unwelcome.  
运动服不见了，真嗣在努力存放便当时注意到了这一点。他再次穿上了那套旧校服，正是初号机将他吐出来时所穿的那套。长久以来，这些衣服仿佛成了他的第二层皮肤。如今却感到陌生，不受欢迎。

"I'm sorry for causing trouble," Shinji whispered. "I don't remember hitting the floor."  
"对不起，给你添麻烦了，" 真嗣低声说道。"我不记得摔到地上了。"

"You didn't," Asuka clarified. "You're not as scrawny as you look. Lay off the burnt rice, will you?"  
"你没有摔，" 明日香澄清道。"你没看起来那么瘦弱。别吃烧焦的米饭了，好吗？"

Blood rushed to his face. _She caught me before I fell. She… we hugged. I almost told her. She told me to wait._ "Sorry," he managed, then shook his head. "Uhm, acknowledged."  
他的脸一下子红了。她在我摔倒前扶住了我。她……我们拥抱了。我差点告诉她。她让我等一下。"对不起，" 他勉强说道，然后摇了摇头。"嗯，明白了。"

"Idiot." “傻瓜。”

They shared a glance, and Shinji caught the brief, minuscule smile that drew on Asuka's features. It faded all too quickly when the heavy steps of a sailor approached. Disgust was evident in the large man's glare. He pushed Shinji out of the cot and up to his feet.  
他们交换了一个眼神，真嗣捕捉到了明日香脸上那转瞬即逝的微小笑容。当沉重的脚步声靠近时，这笑容便迅速消失了。一个身材高大的水兵走了过来，眼神中明显流露出厌恶。他一把将真嗣从床上推下来，让他站起身。

"Hands," the man grunted. He placed a pair of heavy cuffs around Shinji's wrists and pushed him towards the largest hallway. "Walk. Stop wasting the Major's time."  
“手，”那人咕哝道。他给真嗣手腕上套了一副沉重的手铐，然后推着他走向最宽的走廊。“走。别浪费少校的时间。”

Asuka's glare was scalding as it fixed on the man's back, but he offered a last smile to appease her fury. Warmth unrelated to the damaged skin sprung in Shinji's chest. _It's okay, I'll be okay. I'll eat whenever there's food available, too. Thank you._  
明日香盯着那人的背影，目光如炬，但真嗣还是给了她一个最后的微笑，以平息她的怒火。一股与受损皮肤无关的温暖在真嗣胸中涌起。没事的，我会没事的。我也会在有食物的时候吃的。谢谢你。

"Runt." The sailor grabbed his shoulder and forced him to keep a faster pace. "You've got some nerve coming back here. Keep moving."  
“小鬼。”水手抓住他的肩膀，逼他加快步伐。“你还有胆子回来这里。继续走。”

They walked through a maze of smaller corridors, most of them Shinji did not fully remember. Flashes of the time Asuka had taken him to the village returned in droplets. A strange feeling of nostalgia, and an all too familiar longing overcame him. _She really saved me, back then. The way the crew members look at me… it's obvious most of them want me dead. And still, Asuka made sure I didn't die._  
他们穿过迷宫般的小走廊，其中大部分地方真嗣已记不太清。阿斯兰带他去村庄的片段如雨点般闪回。一种奇怪的怀旧感，以及再熟悉不过的渴望涌上心头。她那时真的救了我。船员们看我的眼神……很明显，他们中的大多数都想让我死。然而，阿斯兰确保了我没有死去。

Only when the cage became visible did Shinji realize it was different from the one he had been first thrown into. Blinking red bombs blinked at every corner. Once they reached the door, the sailor punched Shinji in the stomach so hard that the meal almost lurched back to his mouth. He was forced back to his feet and kicked into the cell.  
直到牢笼映入眼帘，真嗣才意识到它与他最初被扔进的那个不同。每个角落都闪烁着红色炸弹的警示灯。当他们到达门口时，水手狠狠地朝真嗣的肚子打了一拳，差点让他把饭吐出来。他被强迫站起身，一脚踢进了牢房。

"Go on, try and get in that Eva of yours," the man rasped. "Give us a reason to press that button, and watch your head explode in a thousand pieces."  
"去吧，试试启动你的 Eva，"那男人嘶哑地说道，"给我们一个按下那个按钮的理由，看你的脑袋炸成千片。"

Pushing down the urge to vomit, Shinji slowly got to his feet and offered the sailor an apologetic glance. The bespectacled pilot who had crashed into him so many years ago waved from behind the man. Her friendly smile was the last thing he saw before the gate hissed closed.  
强压下呕吐的冲动，真嗣缓缓站起身，向那位水手投去歉意的目光。多年前曾撞到他的那位戴眼镜的飞行员在男人背后挥手。她友好的微笑是他看到大门嘶嘶关闭前的最后一幕。

"Little by little, step by step," Shinji said. he smiled upon seeing of something red lying on the cot. Asuka's jacket, the dictionary and his SDAT rested next to the pillow, with a small note attached to the back of the music box.  
"一点一点，一步一步，"真嗣说道。他看到床上躺着一件红色的东西，微笑起来。那是明日香的夹克，字典和他的 SDAT 放在枕头旁边，音乐盒背面附着一张小纸条。

"'You owe me lunch, Idiot.'" he read out loud, uncaring of the cameras blinking at him from every corner. Every step taken towards the cage had only solidified his decision to come aboard. Shinji put on the jacket after a second's hesitation. "Heh, lunch it is. No sesame seeds, promise."  
"“‘你欠我一顿午饭，白痴。’”他大声念出，毫不在意四周闪烁的摄像头。每向笼子迈进一步，都让他更加坚定了上船的决定。真嗣犹豫了一秒后穿上夹克。“嘿，那就午饭吧。我保证，不要芝麻。””

"Princess!" “公主！”

The bored gaze that fell upon Mari felt more welcoming than usual. She wrapped Asuka in a one-sided embrace, careful not to press on the right side where the small flower poked out. Asuka groaned and pushed them both in the direction of their cage.  
落在玛丽身上的那道无聊的目光，今天似乎比往常更让人感到亲切。她小心翼翼地单方面拥抱了明日香，避免压到右侧那朵小花。明日香咕哝着，推着两人向她们的笼子走去。

"You survived, imagine that," she muttered. "Heard you didn't mess up the Paris operation, Four-eyes."  
"你居然活下来了，真是难以置信，"她低声嘟囔。"听说你没搞砸巴黎的任务，四眼仔。"

"Is this praise from our beloved Captain I hear?" Mari inquired, delighted. "Your hair looks brighter than before! Have you been taking naps?" The scent of flowers, clay and coal radiated off her co-pilot in waves. It was a most pleasant change to that of LCL and misery. "And what's on your pocket, hmm?"  
"这是我们敬爱的队长在夸奖我吗？"玛丽问道，显得很高兴。"你的头发比以前更亮了！你是不是在打盹？"她的副驾驶身上散发着花香、泥土和煤烟的味道，一波波地传来。比起 LCL 和痛苦的味道，这真是一个令人愉快的变化。"还有你口袋里装了什么，嗯？"

"Get off me, already," Asuka retorted, yet did nothing to disentangle Mari from her frame. "None of your business, four-eyes."  
"快从我身上下来，"明日香反驳道，却没有推开玛丽紧贴着自己的身体。"不关你的事，四眼仔。"

"Did the Puppy give you those? I saw you sneak into his cell, you know," she commented. Asuka's nonchalance quickly morphed into anger. _Yes! Victory! You finally got it, princess!_ Mari took a few steps back. "Never mind, then!"  
"是小狗给你的吗？我看到你偷偷溜进他的牢房了，你知道的，"她评论道。明日香的不以为意很快转变成了愤怒。没错！胜利了！你终于明白了，公主！真嗣后退了几步。"那就算了！"

"Never mind is right," ground out Asuka. "The place feels even more cramped than before. I suppose you found more books in France."  
"算了就对了，"明日香咬牙切齿地说。"这个地方感觉比以前更挤了。我猜你在法国又找到了更多书。"

"Human knowledge and arts are so vast!" Mari extended her arms and fell on a mountain of books, where the boring novel she had been rereading fell on her lap. "I'd like to conserve and study as much of it as I can. If we manage to change something, after all, wouldn't you like to have reading material to provide the Puppy? A dictionary is rather bleak, in my opinion at least."  
"人类的知识和艺术真是博大精深！"真嗣伸开双臂，倒在了一堆书上，那本她一直在重读的无聊小说落在了她的腿上。"我想尽可能多地保存和研究它们。毕竟，如果我们设法改变些什么，你难道不想为小狗准备些阅读材料吗？在我看来，至少一本字典是相当乏味的。"

_Oh, half a smile!_ Mari's excitement grew with every new reaction Asuka displayed. _So the dictionary was helpful, after all!_  
哦，半抹微笑！随着明日香每一次新的反应，真希的兴奋感愈发高涨。看来那本词典终究还是派上了用场！

"Forgot to bring the stupid book back," Asuka said. "It's not like you don't have other dictionaries somewhere in this mess."  
“忘了把那本蠢书带回来了，”明日香说道，“又不是说你这堆乱七八糟的东西里找不到其他词典。”

_How about a poetry book next, Princess?_ Mari thought with a smile. _That way the Puppy will recite you something other than definitions._ "Ah, that old thing? No worries!" she said. The vase she had procured outside the ship rested comfortably on her shelf. "Say, Princess. You never told me you liked lilacs."  
下次换成诗集如何，公主？真希带着微笑心想。这样小狗就能为你吟诵些定义之外的东西了。“啊，那老古董？别担心！”她说道。她从船外带回的花瓶正安适地摆在架子上。“对了，公主。你可从没告诉过我你喜欢丁香花。”

"Shut up." Asuka removed her jacket and carefully removed the small flower. "Who said I like them? I just happened to pick that one on my way in."  
“闭嘴。”明日香脱下外套，小心翼翼地摘下那朵小花。“谁说我喜欢它们了？我只是碰巧进来时摘了那一朵。”

"Oh, so I suppose these just materialized out of thin air?" Mari asked. She produced the vase and closed the distance between them, pushing the flowers into Asuka's unsuspecting hands. "Quite an interesting selection. Tasteful, delicate and original. Why would you leave such a wonderful present outside?"  
“哦，那我猜这些花是凭空出现的吧？”玛丽问道。她拿出花瓶，走近她们，将花束塞进明日香毫无防备的手中。“真是别致的选择。品味高雅，细腻又独特。你为什么要将这么美好的礼物放在门外呢？”

Navy blue glowed from within Asuka's eyepatch. She almost ripped the vase from Mari's hold and glared death into her face. They were inches apart, so it was easy to see through the façade and glance at the embarrassment.  
明日香的眼罩下透出深蓝色的光芒。她几乎要从玛丽手中夺过花瓶，狠狠地瞪着她的脸。两人近在咫尺，透过表象，不难察觉到那份尴尬。

"How did you get this- you know what? I don't care," she said. "Stupid vase. It's too cumbersome, and how am I supposed to water these, anyway? We barely get enough water to survive in this flying whale corpse."  
"你是怎么拿到这个的——你知道吗？我不在乎，"她说。"这花瓶太笨重了，我该怎么给它们浇水呢？我们在这飞鲸尸体上连生存所需的水都勉强够用。"

"Here!" Mari handed a full canteen, smirk ever present. "I had a little friend in the village who handed me a bit of actual water. You know we don't need much of it, anyway, so let those delightful little ones get some hydration!"  
"给！"玛丽递过一个装满水的水壶，脸上始终带着一丝得意的笑。"我在村子里有个小帮手，他给了我一些真正的水。你知道我们其实不需要太多，就让那些可爱的小家伙们也喝点水吧！"

Sadness clouded Asuka's gaze. "What a waste," she murmured, yet wasted no time in removing the canteen's lid. "What am I doing?"  
悲伤笼罩着明日香的眼神。"真是浪费，"她低声说，但还是迅速拧开了水壶盖。"我在做什么？"

"You're being human, Princess," Mari replied. The petals glistened from the corner where Asuka secured the vase amongst many of her heavy books. "Little by little, step by step."  
"你正在变得像个人类，公主，" 玛丽回答道。花瓣从角落里闪闪发光，那里是明日香将花瓶固定在她许多厚重的书之间的地方。"一点一点，一步一步。"

Asuka shook her head. The half-smirk reappeared on her features as her fingers gently grasped one of the lilacs.  
明日香摇了摇头。她脸上再次露出了半带嘲讽的微笑，手指轻轻地握住了一朵丁香花。

"Heh." "呵呵。"

'_-verything else is as well as can be expected. Old man Bunzaemon has been getting better, and there's plenty of new sprouts. I've gotten better at stitching, too, or so they say! Shinji's been extremely helpful to everyone, lately. He's kind, polite, and dedicated. Give him a chance, will you, sis? Hikari sends her love, so does little Tsubame. She misses her auntie!_  
'-其他一切都还算顺利。老伯布佐卫门身体越来越好了，新芽也长了不少。我的缝纫技术也进步了，大家都这么说！最近，真嗣对每个人都特别有帮助。他善良、有礼貌，而且非常专注。给他一个机会，好吗，姐姐？光也向你问好，还有小燕子。她想念她的阿姨！

_Stay safe, sis. Love ya,  
保重啊，姐。爱你。_

_Toji.'  冬二。_

Had it not been for Ritsuko staring at her back, Sakura would have most likely crumpled the letter to a ball. _Dedicated? Dedicated,_ she thought. Her hands wrung around the paper. _Dedicated to being a selfish jerk and endangering everything! Give him a chance to do what, exactly? Blow us all to hell again? Maybe hand over Unit 01 to his father! All he'll accomplish is hurting himself, and everybody else along the way! How can you pretend to care for Shinji, saying this? You know nothing of what's best for him!  
要不是律子在背后盯着她，真希波很可能已经把信揉成一团了。“专注？”她心想，双手紧紧攥着信纸。专注成为一个自私的混蛋，危及一切！给他机会做什么，具体点？再把我们全炸上天？还是把初号机交给他的父亲！他只会伤害自己，以及沿途的每一个人！你怎么能假装关心真嗣，说出这种话？你对什么对他最好一无所知！  
_

"Your head might start steaming in a second if you keep glaring at that letter," Ritsuko remarked. Maya stifled a small giggle, whereas the blonde's eyes narrowed in Sakura's direction. "Got any good news from our doctor?"  
"如果你继续这样瞪着那封信，你的脑袋可能马上就要冒烟了，" 律子打趣道。真嗣忍住了一丝轻笑，而金发少女的目光则向樱花那边眯了起来。"从我们的医生那里得到什么好消息了吗？"

"He's very thankful for the supplies you sent," Sakura replied curtly. "The effects on open wounds are better than expected. Father Bunzaemon is doing better, and Tsubame is healthy."  
"他对你们送去的物资非常感激，" 樱花简短地回答。"对开放性伤口的效果比预期要好。文左卫门神父状况有所好转，燕也健康。"

Ritsuko nodded. Her gaze remained stoic and penetrating, making Sakura feel more uncomfortable with every passing second. "A ray of light in our dark little tin can," she grumbled. "Isn't that grand, Maya? And still, Sakura seems rather unhappy. Any idea of what could be wrong?"  
律子点点头。她的目光依旧冷静而锐利，让樱花每过一秒都感到更加不自在。"我们这黑暗的小罐头里的一束光，" 她咕哝道。"这不是很棒吗，真嗣？可樱花看起来似乎并不开心。你知道可能是什么问题吗？"

"Well, there was that incident with the Third Child," Maya commented. "Must be tough to see him again, after all that happened."  
"嗯，还有那个与第三适格者的事件，" 真希波评论道，"再次见到他一定很艰难，毕竟发生了那么多事。"

"Not too fair to blame someone we treated as a prisoner for trying to escape." The sarcasm in Ritsuko's voice was poignant, annoying as nails being dragged on a board. "A child manipulated his entire life, being manipulated yet again, after being mistreated. All of that after he saved the Second Child during Unit 01's retrieval. Oh, well. At least we have the collar, right?'  
"把我们当作囚犯对待的人试图逃跑，这并不公平。" 律子语气中的讽刺意味尖锐，令人烦躁如指甲划过黑板，"一个孩子一生都在被操纵，再次被操纵，在被虐待之后。这一切都发生在他救了第二适格者在初号机回收期间。哦，好吧。至少我们有项圈，对吧？"

_How can you be so nonchalant about Shinji being here? The others are not going to sit quietly at this. They're going to see you as weak. Indecisive. Flailing from one extreme to the other, and I'm being torn apart. They already threatened to hurt Tsubame. I have to protect her, and Ikari as well.  
你怎么能对真嗣在这里如此漠不关心？其他人不会对此坐视不管的。他们会认为你软弱。优柔寡断。从一个极端摇摆到另一个极端，而我被撕裂了。他们已经威胁要伤害燕。我必须保护她，还有碇。_

"I need to go. Apologies, Doctor Akagi," Sakura said. She bowed to both officials and marched out of the room. "I'll recheck our medical supplies as you requested."  
“我得走了。抱歉，赤城医生，” 樱说道。她向两位官员鞠了一躬，然后大步走出了房间。“我会按照您的要求重新检查我们的医疗物资。”

The ship's engines rumbled into life after she left the room. The group awaited at the lower levels, amidst the fresh supplies received at the village, far away from surveillance cameras. All Toji's words and effort had accomplished was to broaden her fear. Why had her brother not kept Shinji safely tucked away in the village? Instead, he had forced Sakura into the impossible position of trying to save both The Third Child and the world.  
她离开房间后，船的引擎轰鸣启动。一群人在下层等待着，那里堆满了从村庄收到的补给，远离监控摄像头。所有加持的话语和努力，不过是加深了她的恐惧。为什么她的哥哥没有把真嗣安全地藏在村庄里？相反，他迫使樱陷入了一个不可能的境地，试图同时拯救第三适格者和整个世界。

_Give him a break. Just one break. I did. He was supposed to live a normal life where he could atone, and grow. His 'break', his chance was staying behind, with you, with everyone._ She hurried through the paths, frightened by the growing whispers coming from behind the monstrous vertebrae. _Don't you get it, stupid big brother?_ _It's up to us to defeat Gendo Ikari. To these guys, it's victory by whatever means necessary, even if... even if it means Shinji has to die. Is that what you want?_  
给他一个机会。就一个机会。我给了。他本该过上正常的生活，在那里赎罪和成长。他的‘机会’，他的机会是留下来，和你，和大家一起。她匆忙穿过小径，被从巨大脊椎骨后面传来的越来越大的窃窃私语吓坏了。你还不明白吗，愚蠢的哥哥？我们得打败碇源堂。对这些人来说，胜利可以不择手段，即使...即使这意味着真嗣必须死。这就是你想要的吗？

"Hitting the brat is no use," Kitakami reprimanded. The sailor who had escorted Shinji to the cell shrugged. "If we each get a smack on him, it still changes nothing."  
“打那小子没用，”北上训斥道。押送真嗣到牢房的士兵耸了耸肩。“就算我们每个人都给他一巴掌，也改变不了什么。”

"Never mind that, what's the news on Unit 01's self-destruct system?" the engineer demanded. He was nervous, constantly looking for prying eyes or ears. "Can it be activated remotely?"  
“别管那个了，零号机自毁系统有什么进展？”工程师追问道。他显得很紧张，不停地寻找着窥探的目光或耳朵。“能远程激活吗？”

"Not yet. The only way to activate it right now is manually. We're working on a trigger, though," Takao replied. "If that doesn't work, there's always plan B. Ikari wants Unit 01, without it his entire scenario and life's work turns to dust. We have the thing he wants. That's our advantage."  
“还没。目前唯一能激活它的方法只有手动。不过我们正在研究触发器，”高雄回答。“如果这行不通，还有 B 计划。碇想要零号机，没有它，他的整个计划和毕生心血都将化为泡影。我们有他想要的东西。这就是我们的优势。”

"What if we coerce the brat?" Nagara was the next to speak. Her eyes narrowed at the green armband they all sported, and lingered on Sakura's frame. "If it can be done manually, let's make it so that devil spawn thinks there is no other way."  
"如果我们胁迫那小子呢？" 长良接着说道。她的目光紧盯着他们所有人佩戴的绿色臂章，随后停留在樱的身上。"如果可以手动操作，我们就让那恶魔之子以为别无选择。"

"Unlikely." Takao crossed his arms and turned his gaze to the ceiling. "The unit's awakened. It can probably override even the pilot's will. I'd have to think it possesses some form of self-preservation, at least until its purpose is achieved."  
"不太可能。" 高雄交叉双臂，目光转向天花板。"那台机体已经觉醒了。它或许能凌驾于驾驶员的意志之上。我想它至少会具备某种自我保护机制，直到完成其使命。"

One of the pilots groaned. "I told you guys," he started. "Akagi accessed the dummy system. She's working on commands that will override even the awakened state. We'll have one chance to blow both Unit 01 and 13 into hell. The Third Child is irrelevant. In fact, if by some reason he was to say… disappear… it would benefit the cause."  
其中一名驾驶员呻吟道："我早就告诉过你们，"他开口道，"赤木启动了模拟系统。她正在编写能覆盖觉醒状态的指令。我们只有一次机会将零一和十三号机一起炸入地狱。第三适格者无关紧要。事实上，如果他因为某种原因……消失了……反而对我们的计划有利。"

"How do we know Akagi is on our side?" Sakura spoke for the first time. Dread boiled in her chest, stifling her breathing along with an impending sense of doom. "She's always been on the Captain's side. Aren't they friends or something?"  
"我们怎么知道赤木是站在我们这边的？" 真希波首次开口道。恐惧在她胸中沸腾，压抑着她的呼吸，伴随着一种即将到来的厄运感。"她一直站在舰长那边。他们不是朋友之类的吗？"

"Doctor Akagi is pragmatic," Kitakami interjected. "She's using the Captain and her plan to achieve our own objective. Why would she waste days of work on that purple beast, otherwise? Besides, she's the closest to the Captain, and the best suited to assume command after we make our move."  
"赤木博士是务实的，" 北上插话道，"她利用舰长和她的计划来实现我们的目标。否则，她为什么要浪费那么多天在那只紫色怪兽身上？再者，她是舰长身边最亲近的人，也是在我们行动后最适合接管指挥的人。"

"I guess that's true," Sakura conceded. Uncertainty brewed somewhere within her, ignited by Toji's letter. _All I wanted was for him to be safe. How am I supposed to do that, now?_ "I'll keep you posted on the Third Child," she lied. "I'll have decoded the cell's commands by the time we reach ground zero."  
"我想那是真的，" 真希波让步道。某种不确定感在她内心酝酿，被冬二的那封信点燃。我所希望的只是让他安全。现在我该怎么做呢？"我会随时向你汇报第三适格者的情况，" 她撒谎道，"在我们到达地面零点之前，我会解码细胞的指令。"

"Everyone knows their role and tasks, then," the engineer said. "For a world where trees can grow."  
"每个人都知道自己的角色和任务，那么，"工程师说道。"为了一个树木能生长的世界。"

"For a world where trees can grow," echoed the group, disbanding.  
"为了一个树木能生长的世界，"众人重复着，解散了。"

A hand stopepd Sakura in her tracks. "Don't be going soft on me, Suzuhara," Kitakami rasped. She gripped the sidearm in her vest. "We need to win this battle, and if that brat stands in the way, you better react accordingly. You know what happens if you don't."  
一只手拦住了樱的脚步。"别对我心软，铃原，"北上哑着嗓子说。她紧握着背心里的手枪。"我们需要赢得这场战斗，如果那小子挡路，你最好做出相应的反应。你知道如果你不这样做会发生什么。"

"O-Of course," Sakura nodded, forcing an angry frown on her features. "You know I'm on your side. We need to win."  
"当然，" 樱点头，强行在脸上挤出一个愤怒的皱眉。"你知道我站在你这边。我们需要赢。"

"That's more like it." Midori gave her shoulder a friendly tap and turned away. "Keep us posted on those codes."  
"这才像话。" 美里友好地拍了拍她的肩膀，转身离开。"随时向我们报告那些代码的进展。"

_We need to win this battle._ Sakura's heartbeat rang loud in her ears. The uneasy sensation of eyes on her back, of suspicious mutineers measuring her every move weighed down her limbs. _Damn it, Shinji. Why couldn't you have just stayed safe? What am I supposed to do if you decide to pilot again?  
我们必须赢得这场战斗。樱的心跳在耳边回响。那种不安的感觉，背后有怀疑的叛徒在审视她的一举一动，让她的四肢沉重。该死，真嗣。你为什么就不能安全待着？如果你决定再次驾驶，我该怎么办？  
_

Something dashed out of sight to her left. Sakura barely caught the flash of golden hair that disappeared all too quickly for her to get a proper look. "Calm down," she repeated Ritsuko's words. "They're always watching."  
有什么东西在她左边一闪而过。小樱勉强捕捉到那一抹金色发丝，消失得太快，让她来不及细看。“冷静下来，”她重复着律子的叮嘱，“他们总是在观察。”

_Weird,_ she thought. _Where have I seen hair like that before?_  
奇怪，她心想。我以前在哪里见过那样的头发？

---

"He looks… better." “他看起来……好多了。”

Misato felt Ritsuko's gaze shift from the video feed to her. Watching Shinji read through the pages of the old dictionary tore a hole in her heart. She felt insignificant, mediocre and bitter. _All he got was a bit of humanity and honesty, and look at him. You couldn't even do that._  
美里感觉到律子的目光从视频画面转向了她。看着真嗣翻阅那本旧字典，她的心仿佛被撕开了一个口子。她感到自己微不足道、平庸且苦涩。他所得到的不过是些许人性和真诚，而他却能做到如此。你甚至无法做到这一点。

"Definitely healthier than the last time I saw him," Akagi said. "He was gaunt and pale, now he's even built a bit of a physique." She produced an old box of mints and pushed one into her mouth. "What do you plan to do with him? You could've just told Shikinami to leave him in the village."  
"显然比上次见到他时健康多了，" 赤木律子说道，"上次他瘦削苍白，现在甚至练出了些许体格。" 她拿出一盒旧薄荷糖，塞了一颗进嘴里。"你打算怎么处置他？你本可以让式波直接把他留在村子里的。"

_What to do, indeed,_ Misato frowned at the screen. "Doesn't matter, at this point. The last time he was in Unit 01, his sync rate was zero. Unit 13 was rigged to respond to him. What we do or don't do with him won't make a difference."  
确实如此，美里皱眉看着屏幕。"现在这已经无关紧要了。上次他在初号机里时，同步率为零。十三号机被设定为对他有反应。我们对他做什么或不做什么都不会有任何区别。"

"And that's a great thing to say to the crew," Ritsuko muttered. "But how about some honesty? We're about to go 'interrogate' him, after all."  
"对船员说这话倒是挺好的，" 律子低声嘟囔。"但来点实话如何？我们毕竟是要去'审问'他。"

"I have a hunch," Misato confessed, glad her eyes were concealed under the glasses. "I can't explain it, but something tells me Shinji needs to be here. That aside," she produced a dry chuckle. "Go tell Asuka she can't bring him along, and see how that goes."  
"我有一种直觉，" 美里坦白道，庆幸自己的眼睛藏在眼镜下。"我说不清，但总觉得真嗣需要在这里。话说回来，" 她干笑一声。"去告诉明日香她不能带他来，看看那会是什么结果。"

"To be fair, it was Shinji's choice to come. Nobody forced him, hell, Asuka even offered to leave him in the village," said Ritsuko. Misato noticed her frigid eyes soften with a tang of sadness. "She probably would've defused his collar, too. Can't say I'd blame her."  
"公平地说，是真嗣自己选择来的。没人强迫他，见鬼，明日香甚至提出把他留在村子里，" 律子说。美里注意到她冰冷的目光中流露出一丝悲伤。"她可能还会帮他解开项圈。我不能说她这么做有错。"

"What a turn of events." Misato forced the stoic mask back on her features. "She was telling him to lay down and die a month ago, and now she's looking after the flowers he gave her." Her shoulders slumped before they exited her quarters. "I couldn't give either of them a shred of basic human kindness, Rits. They had to find a way to give it to one another."  
“真是世事难料。”美里强压下脸上的僵硬表情。“一个月前她还让他躺下等死，现在却在照顾他送的花。”走出房间前，她的肩膀垂了下来。“我没能给他们任何一点基本的人性关怀，理津子。他们只能自己找到相互给予的方式。”

"Yeah, well, boo hoo," Ritsuko rolled her eyes. Her old friend punched her in the arm. "Nothing to do about it now. Who know? Maybe it was for the best. What did Kaji always say? Have a little faith."  
“是啊，唉，真是可怜。”律子翻了个白眼。老朋友捶了下她的手臂。“现在也没什么办法了。谁知道呢？也许这样最好。加治总是怎么说来着？有点信心。”

_Jeez, could you maybe not be so blunt for once in your life? A little faith. Coming from the biggest pessimist on this damn ship, I really must be pathetic with my moping. I hate how you can see right through me, after so many years.  
"“天啊，你就不能偶尔不这么直白吗？有点信心。从这艘该死的船上最大的悲观主义者嘴里说出来，我这副垂头丧气的样子真是可悲。我讨厌你这么多年后还能一眼看穿我。”_

The cage was hilariously large, the bombs set to blow unnecessary considering she carried the DSS trigger at all times. Such foolish security measures reminded Misato of the casket the doctors had placed Asuka in, fourteen years before. Shinji was still reading his book when the door hissed opened. His smile felt like a blade that sunk in her ribcage.  
笼子大得可笑，炸弹设定为随时引爆，考虑到她随时携带 DSS 触发器，这显得多此一举。这些愚蠢的安全措施让 Misato 想起了十四年前医生们将 Asuka 放入棺材的情景。Shinji 还在读他的书，当门嘶嘶作响地打开时。他的微笑像一把刀，刺入了她的胸膛。

"Hi, Misat- uhm," he looked away and put away the dictionary. "Colonel. How can I help you?"  
“嗨，Misat——呃，”他移开视线，收起了字典。“上校。我能帮您什么？”

_Cameras. There are cameras here. You have to remain stoic, you have to._ "Let's not waste time, there's little enough as it is," she ground out. Every word made Misato hate herself a little more. "What are your intentions in the Wunder? If you're here to disobey, I'll strap you to a VTOL and send you back to Village 3."  
这里有摄像头。你必须保持镇定，必须。“我们别浪费时间了，本来就不多了，”她咬牙切齿地说。每说一个字，Misato 就更加厌恶自己。“你在 Wunder 上的意图是什么？如果你来这里是为了违抗命令，我会把你绑在 VTOL 上送回第三村。”

"I understand," Shinji said. The smile faded. "I'm here to do whatever you command of me, whatever I can to help. If that means carrying boxes or cleaning floors, that's perfectly fine."  
"我明白，" 真嗣说道。笑容逐渐消失。"我在这里是为了完成您吩咐的任何任务，尽我所能提供帮助。无论是搬箱子还是打扫地板，我都完全没问题。"

Misato bit down on her lip to keep it from quivering. _He sounds articulate, calm. Determined._ "You're not getting out of this cell unless some emergency forces the crew to move you elsewhere," she commanded. Shinji nodded, still hiding his gaze from her glasses. _I must remind you of your father. How disgusting, right, Shin-chan?_ "You'll eat the provided rations, and you'll do as ordered by the crew, is that understood?"  
美里咬紧嘴唇，以免颤抖。他的声音条理清晰，平静而坚定。"除非有紧急情况迫使船员将你转移到其他地方，否则你不会离开这间牢房，"她命令道。真嗣点头，依旧避开她的目光。我一定让你想起了你的父亲。多么令人厌恶，对吧，真嗣君？"你会吃提供的口粮，并服从船员的命令，明白了吗？"

"Yes, Colonel," Shinji whispered. Only when his hand lingered on Asuka's jacket did Misato notice it was on his bed. "Is there anything I can do to help? Anything at all?"  
"是的，上校，" 真嗣低声说道。直到他的手停留在明日香的夹克上，美里才注意到那件夹克在他的床上。"有什么我能帮忙的吗？任何事情都行？"

_Yes. No. I don't know. Something tells me you certainly can. The steel in your eyes tells me you will. Kaji would believe in you, so I guess I have no choice but to do the same.  
是的。不。我不知道。某种感觉告诉我，你肯定能行。你眼中的坚定告诉我，你一定会做到。加持会相信你，所以我似乎别无选择，只能同样相信你。_

"Stay here," Misato said after minutes of tense silence. "Do as you're told, don't starve yourself." Ritsuko nodded from behind, signaling the red lights of the cameras had stopped blinking. "Shinji." Her voice wavered. "What happened in Village 3?"  
“待在这里，”美里在紧张的沉默几分钟后说道，“照我说的做，别饿着自己。”律子在后面点头示意，摄像头的红灯已经停止闪烁。“真嗣。”她的声音颤抖着，“第三新东京市发生了什么？”

The smile brightened Shinji's features again. "Not much, really. Nothing interesting or noteworthy. I was… allowed to work. It helped clear my mind a bit, or so I'd like to think so." His gaze shifted from Misato's glasses to Ritsuko's blank expression. "I'm sorry for everything I've caused. It was stupid of me to believe I could fix everything. I… also understand that me being sorry solves nothing."  
微笑再次点亮了真嗣的面容。“其实没什么，真的。没什么有趣或值得注意的。我……被允许工作。这有助于理清我的思绪，或者说我希望如此。”他的目光从美里的眼镜移到律子毫无表情的脸上。“我为所有我造成的事情道歉。相信我能解决一切，真是愚蠢。我……也明白，我的道歉解决不了任何问题。”

"I'm not here for a confession, not one of regret in any case," Misato replied curtly. "Did the Ayanami clone reveal any information regarding your father's plans?"  
"我不是来听你忏悔的，至少不是为了后悔的那种，" 美里简短地回答。"绫波零的克隆体有没有透露关于你父亲计划的信息？"

A frown darkened Shinji's brow. "No, nothing but what you already know," he said. His shoulders slumped, and sadness clouded his gaze. "My father won't stop until he gets his wish. She didn't know any specifics… she didn't even know what plants are."  
真嗣的眉头紧皱。"没有，除了你已经知道的以外，什么都没有，" 他说。他的肩膀下垂，眼神中充满了悲伤。"我父亲不会罢休，直到他实现愿望。她不知道任何具体细节……她甚至不知道什么是植物。"

"Our readings indicate the final stage has begun. Unit 13's activity spiked yesterday," Ritsuko added from her perch by the door. "Gendo Ikari has almost all the tools he needs. Almost."  
"我们的数据显示最终阶段已经开始了。13 号机昨天的活动急剧增加，" 律子站在门口补充道。"碇源堂几乎拥有了所有他需要的工具。几乎。"

"He still needs my mother," Shinji concluded. "Can we not just… make Unit 01 self-destruct?"  
"他还需要我的母亲，" 真嗣得出结论。"我们不能……让初号机自毁吗？"

Misato shared a glance with the blonde, shocked. The idea was nothing but a bluff to round up possible mutineers, but video feed of Shinji potentially agreeing to it was sure to raise a few eyebrows.  
美里与金发女子交换了一个眼神，震惊不已。这个想法不过是用来震慑潜在叛乱者的虚张声势，但真嗣可能同意的视频画面肯定会引起一些人的注意。

"The Eva is in an awakened state, or sentient," explained the captain. The cameras began recording again. "We've already tried to access the self-destruct sequence, with zero results. Our best chance is the manual override inside the Entry Plug."  
"EVA 处于觉醒状态，或者说是有自我意识，" 队长解释道。摄像头再次开始录制。"我们已经尝试过启动自毁程序，但没有结果。我们最好的机会是进入插入栓手动操作。"

"Rei might still be…" Shinji trailed off, shaking his head. "She'd understand. What would happen if I activated the sequence?"  
"丽可能还在……" 真嗣话没说完，摇了摇头。"她会理解的。如果我启动序列会发生什么？"

"Your guess is as good as ours," muttered Ritsuko. "There's no guarantee the Eva will 'agree' to it. Plus, you'd have to be synched with Unit 01 to do so. Your last scores were zero."  
"我们的猜测和你的一样好，" 律子咕哝道。"不能保证 Eva 会‘同意’。而且，你必须与 01 号机同步才能这么做。你上次的同步率是零。"

"I've heard people don't want me to get close to Unit 01." Shinji's voice quieted further. Misato saw the steel slowly return to his eyes. "Whatever you need me to do, I'll do. There are things in this world that need to be protected, no matter what."  
"我听说有些人不希望我接近 01 号机。" 真嗣的声音更低了。美里看到他眼中逐渐恢复了坚定。"无论需要我做什么，我都会做。这个世界有些东西需要被保护，无论如何。"

_No matter what._ Misato's eyes softened. The cameras turned off again, long enough for her to grasp Shinji's shoulder and squeeze. _If my son is half as good a young man as you, I'll be the proudest mother in the world._  
无论如何。美里眼神柔和下来。摄像头再次关闭，足够她抓住真嗣的肩膀并紧握。如果我的儿子能有你一半的好，我将是世界上最骄傲的母亲。

"You've grown up," she whispered. A renegade smile shone through her stony façade. The cell's gate opened, the red dots activated again. "Take care of yourself, Shinji."  
“你长大了，”她低声说。一个叛逆的微笑穿透了她坚硬的伪装。牢房的门打开了，红点再次激活。“照顾好自己，真嗣。”

_Strength. Beauty. Steadfast. Bravery.  
力量。美丽。坚定。勇敢。_

The WonderSwan beeped as Asuka lost yet another bout without realizing. Mari sat a few feet away, pretending to read some vulgarly large novel she did not recognize. The vase sat on her uncovered side; it swayed along with the ship, and every time a petal fell, her brow would twitch.  
随着明日香又一次未察觉到就输掉了一局，WonderSwan 发出哔哔声。真里坐在几英尺外，假装在读一本她不认识的、大得夸张的小说。花瓶放在她未遮盖的一侧；它随着船摇摆，每掉落一片花瓣，她的眉头就会抽动一下。

_Idiot. Why did you have to come? Why did you have to make things complicated? Why can't I get mad at you? Why do I feel so desperate to win, all of the sudden?  
白痴。你为什么要来？为什么要让事情变得复杂？为什么我不能对你生气？为什么我突然这么渴望赢？_

'_YOU LOST! PLAY AGAIN? Y/N'_  
'你输了！再来一局？是/否'

"That's four in a row, Princess," commented Mari. Her eyes peered from behind the book. "Anything on your mind?"  
“已经连续四次了，公主，”玛丽评论道。她的眼睛从书后窥视着。“你在想什么呢？”

"None of your damn business," Asuka retorted. "I'm just bored of this dumb game."  
“关你屁事，”明日香反驳道。“我只是厌倦了这个愚蠢的游戏。”

"After fourteen years, you're bored?" Mari echoed her own thoughts without knowing. "That's a development. Say, and please don't bite my head off," she said, offering a sheepish smile. "How was your vacation?"  
“十四年了，你才厌倦？”玛丽不自觉地重复了自己的想法。“这倒是新鲜事。对了，请别咬掉我的头，”她带着一丝尴尬的微笑说道。“你的假期怎么样？”

_Peaceful._ "Uneventful." 平静。“无事发生。”

"Did the Puppy give you much trouble?"  
“小狗给你添麻烦了吗？”

_For a few days, he did. I was… worried._ "When does he ever not give me trouble?"  
有几天确实如此。我……担心过。“他什么时候不给我找麻烦呢？”

"But you said it was uneventful. Did you at least _try_ not being mean to him?"  
"但你说过那很平淡无奇。你至少尝试过不那么刻薄对他吗？"

_I did my best. Not that it amounts to anything._ Shinji's words rang through her mind. _I'm Asuka, huh._ "I guess," she responded. "Hard to do that when it's my default setting. I ended up shoveling more rations down the idiot's throat. Turns out I-" Shinji's fearful gaze flashed through her mind. "-I maybe shouldn't have."  
我尽力了。虽然没什么用。真嗣的话在她脑海中回响。我是惣流，对吧。“我想是的，”她回答道。“当这是我的默认模式时，很难做到不刻薄。结果我反而给那傻瓜塞了更多口粮。原来我——”真嗣那恐惧的目光在她脑海中闪过。“——我也许不该这么做。”

"Her Royal Highness, admitting to a fault?" Mari whistled and turned the page on her novel. "What sort of things did you do?"  
"尊贵的殿下，承认错误了？" 玛丽吹了声口哨，翻过她小说的一页。"你都做了些什么？"

_Cook._ "Play the stupid game." _Start a fire, work with clay._ "Make sure the idiot didn't starve." _Eat. I ate lots of great food._ "Fish." _Made friends with Rei._ "Waste my time with the dumb Ayanami series clone." _Plant a tree, hell, four of them_. _Sleep_. _Dream._ "Nothing interesting. Boring stuff."  
烹饪。‘玩那愚蠢的游戏。’生火，玩泥巴。‘确保那傻瓜没饿死。’吃饭。我吃了好多美味的食物。‘钓鱼。’和丽交朋友。‘浪费时间在那个笨蛋绫波系列克隆人身上。’种棵树，见鬼，种了四棵。睡觉。做梦。‘没什么有趣的。无聊透顶。’

"Fish, you say? Isn't that a little… dull?" Mari inquired. "Sitting there waiting for something to happen, I mean."  
‘你说钓鱼？是不是有点……乏味？’玛丽问道。‘我是说，坐在那儿干等着什么发生。’

_It's not boring if you have someone to talk to_. The penguin leader ruffled its feathers and squawked in her memory. _Or if you have some creepy bird follow you around, and berate you over your choice of words._  
如果有个人聊天，就不无聊了。记忆中，那只企鹅领袖抖了抖羽毛，嘎嘎叫着。或者有只诡异的鸟跟着你，对你的措辞指指点点。

"Everything's dull after you're an Eva pilot," Asuka lied. Soft waves crashing ashore, the smell of salt water, burning wood and fried fish. Smiles, jokes. Home. "What's the difference between sitting here and sitting on a box near the ocean?"  
“成为 Eva 驾驶员后，一切都变得索然无味了。”明日香撒了个谎。轻柔的海浪拍打着岸边，咸水的气息，燃烧的木头和煎鱼的香味。笑容，笑话。家。“坐在这里和坐在海边的一个箱子上有什么区别呢？”

"Maybe the company. Or the scenery! Or perhaps just the… oh," Mari trailed off. She closed the book and stared at her. "Wow."  
“或许是陪伴。或是风景！又或许只是……哦，”真希波话音渐弱。她合上书，凝视着她。“哇。”

"What?" “什么？”

"You smiled just now," she clarified. "Two smiles in one day. I can't say I've ever seen that in fourteen years." Mari's gaze softened, turning warm and somewhat relieved. "I think you should do more boring stuff. It's good for you."  
“你刚才笑了，”她解释道。“一天之内笑了两次。十四年来我从未见过。”真希波的目光变得柔和，温暖而略带释然。“我觉得你应该多做些无聊的事。对你有好处。”

"Good for me, yeah right." Shifting to present her back to Mari, Asuka focused on the vase swinging from side to side. "Who cares about any of that?"  
"对我有好处，是啊，说得轻巧。" 阿斯卡转身背对着玛丽，目光集中在左右摇摆的花瓶上。"谁在乎那些？"

"The Puppy does," came Mari's quiet response. "I do. Have a little hope!"  
"小狗在乎，" 玛丽轻声回应，"我在乎。有点希望吧！"

Asuka refused to answer. The game beeped away as she began winning bout after bout, all the while stealing glances at the flowers. So what if the stupid crew members found out? They had already treated her like a monster before. A bit of spite in their fake, nervous smiles was a welcoming change, if anything.  
阿斯卡拒绝回答。随着她一局接一局地获胜，游戏机发出嘀嘀声，她不时偷瞄着那些花。就算那些愚蠢的船员发现了又怎样？他们之前已经把她当怪物看待了。比起他们虚伪紧张的笑容中夹杂的一丝怨恨，反倒是一种令人欣慰的变化。

"_You're Asuka. That'll always be enough."_  
"你是明日香。这就足够了。"

"_Are you hungry?"_  "你饿了吗？"

"_I'd like to go with you."_  
"我想和你一起去。"

"_Actually, I'm not feeling lonely right now."_  
"实际上，我现在并不觉得孤单。"

"Hope, huh," Asuka rasped. Makinami was already engrossed in her book, turning pages quicker than the average human could possibly read through. _Fishing again at that spot. Sitting by that dumb blonde's spot, where the Idiot Tree is growing. Being bored. With him._ "A feeling of expectation, and desire for a certain thing to happen."  
"希望，呵，" 明日香沙哑地说道。真希波已经沉浸在她的书里，翻页的速度快到常人难以企及。再次在那地方钓鱼。坐在那个傻金发女孩的位置，那里长着那棵蠢树。感到无聊。和他一起。"一种期待的感觉，渴望某件事情发生。"

---

"It's almost hopeless." "几乎是无望的。"

Koji shifted his weight, darting glances at all directions before turning the corner. He retrieved a beaten mints box hidden above an airduct, unfurled the small paper within, and ate it after reading its content.  
小吉调整了一下重心，四处快速扫视后转过拐角。他从通风管道上方取出一个破旧的薄荷糖盒，展开里面的纸条，读完后将其吃掉。

"Ugh, tastes like cigarettes," he grumbled. A burst of motion to his right indicated his guest had arrived. "Been a very long time. Proper formalities will have to wait, I suppose."  
“呃，味道像烟一样，”他咕哝着。右侧突然的动静表明他的客人到了。“好久不见了。正式的礼节恐怕得先放一放了。”

No response, not even the sound of breathing. It was always irked Koji how quiet this person could be. _Won't even bother asking how the hell he got on the ship. Not like he'd tell me._  
没有回应，连呼吸声都没有。这个人总是能让小吉感到恼火，他可以如此安静。甚至懒得问他是怎么上船的。反正他也不会告诉我。

"Things are looking grim," Takao murmured. "More than half the crew is all for a coup if the captain's plan doesn't work. There's no boundary they're not willing to cross in order to win. I added as much detail about each as I could."  
“情况看起来不妙，”高尾低声说，“如果船长的计划失败，超过一半的船员都支持政变。为了胜利，他们没有什么底线是不愿跨越的。我尽可能详细地描述了每个人的情况。”

After rummaging through his jacket, he placed a tiny note of his own in the box and threw it into the air; it never hit the ground. An old cigarette box flew in his direction afterwards.  
他在夹克里摸索了一番，将一张小纸条放入盒中，随即抛向空中；它从未落地。随后，一个旧烟盒朝他飞来。

"Keep out of the range of the cameras. Most of these guys work on the lower levels, close to the spinal column," Koji said, straightening after storing the box. "Not sure how you plan to do this, but most of them are armed. Desperate, too. If it comes to a scramble, we'll get squashed in minutes."  
“避开摄像头的范围。这些人大多在较低层工作，靠近脊柱区域，”小吉说着，收好盒子后站直了身子，“不清楚你打算怎么做，但他们大多都携带武器，也很绝望。如果发生混战，我们几分钟内就会被碾压。”

Turning to look at the corner, Koji grunted and shook his head. "Jeez, you could at least tell me you're leaving. Knock on the wall or something next time. I already feel like a fool doing all this stuff."  
转向角落，小吉哼了一声，摇了摇头。“真是的，你至少可以告诉我你要离开。下次敲敲墙什么的。我已经觉得自己像个傻瓜在做这些事了。”

The crew's main hall was bursting with activity, with lots of sailors taking their rations and laughing on occasion. However, the air was tense. Many crew members muttered about the Third Child amongst themselves, whereas others glared at those not wearing a certain color on their arm. Takao could almost see the crew split in half.  
船员的主厅里热闹非凡，许多水手领取着口粮，偶尔发出笑声。然而，气氛却很紧张。许多船员私下里嘀咕着关于第三子的事情，而另一些人则对那些手臂上没有特定颜色的人怒目而视。高雄几乎能感觉到船员们分成了两派。

_A world filled with trees. A world where I can watch my nephews grow,_ he thought while eating a ration. _We're counting on you, Shinji._  
一个充满树木的世界。一个我可以看着侄子们成长的世界，他一边吃着口粮一边想。我们可都指望你了，真嗣。

---

"To surrender or give up, or permit injury or disadvantage to, for the sake of something else."  
为了其他事物而放弃或允许伤害与不利。

Shinji sighed. Without a marker or pencil anywhere, all he could do was read the definitions out loud until they stuck in his brain. "The act of giving up something that you want to keep," he carried on. "Especially in order to get something else… or to help someone."  
真嗣叹了口气。手边既没有标记也没有铅笔，他只能大声读出定义，希望它们能留在脑海里。“放弃你想要保留的东西的行为，”他继续道，“尤其是为了得到其他东西……或是帮助某人。”

_Sacrifice.  牺牲。_

The new cell was not too uncomfortable, nor did it feel as stifling as the first one had. He had spent most of his earlier short stay sprawled on the floor, shivering, hallucinating, and unable to think. Fear coursed through him, uncertainty made his leg lump up and down, frustration and sadness forced his hand to clench and unclench.  
新牢房不算太难受，也没有第一间那么压抑。他之前短暂停留时，大部分时间都瘫在地上，颤抖、幻觉连连，无法思考。恐惧在他体内流淌，不确定性让他的腿不停地抽搐，挫败感和悲伤迫使他的手紧握又松开。

_Why do I feel calm, then?_ Shinji wondered, stretching on the cot. _Rei passed with a smile on her face. She believed in me. Asuka brought me along when she could have just left me in the village. What's my life, my existence, if it means I can make sure those trees grow?_  
那我为何感到平静呢？真嗣躺在床上伸展身体，心中疑惑。绫波经过时面带微笑。她相信我。明日香带我一起走，尽管她本可以把我留在村子里。如果我的生命，我的存在，意味着我能确保那些树生长，那又如何？

Agony blossomed in his chest. No more afternoons spent fishing, no more cups to craft, no more food to cook, no more books to read. No more of Asuka's smile. Tears burned in his eyelids at the thought of never seeing her grunt a chuckle again, or hear how her voice lost its bite when she called him an idiot.  
剧痛在他胸口蔓延。再也不能度过钓鱼的下午，再也不能制作杯子，再也不能烹饪食物，再也不能读书。再也不能看到明日香的笑容。想到再也听不到她咕哝着笑出声，或是听到她叫他笨蛋时声音里的尖锐消失，泪水便在眼睑中灼烧。

"I'd like to see the penguins again," he whispered. The SDAT had precious little battery power; it lay a few inches away from his head, battered yet functional. "I'd like to listen to music with her again."  
"我想再看看企鹅，"他低声说。SDAT 的电池所剩无几；它躺在离他头部几英寸远的地方，虽有损伤但仍能使用。"我想再和她一起听音乐。"

_Even at the cost of everyone losing everything? What right do I still have to be selfish? I've been given so much, in so little time. I was able to experience so much. So many precious memories, so many moments I don't deserve.  
即使这意味着所有人失去一切？我还有什么权利自私？在这么短的时间里，我得到了这么多。我经历了这么多。这么多珍贵的记忆，这么多我不配拥有的时刻。_

"Treasure," Shinji said. His fingers brushed against the roundel that rested in his pant pocket. "Bond."  
"珍宝，"真嗣说。他的手指轻触着放在裤袋里的圆形徽章。"羁绊。"

Time crawled ever so slowly, yet noticing its passing without a clock or even a change in the lights was almost impossible. How many days remained until they reached his father's base? None of the skills he had recently acquired were useful. There was no way to smash the door like it was wood and hope it would open, nobody required him to cook a thing, and not in ten years would he understand enough of electronics to bypass the gate's security.  
时间缓缓爬行，然而没有钟表甚至灯光变化的情况下察觉其流逝几乎是不可能的。他们到达他父亲基地的日子还剩多少？他最近学到的任何技能都派不上用场。无法像砸木门那样砸开这扇门并期待它打开，没有人要求他烹饪任何东西，十年内他也无法理解足够的电子知识来绕过大门的安全系统。

_Build. Earn. Struggle. Step by step.  
建造。赢得。奋斗。一步一步。_

Food was served after what felt like hours, with the same assortments of paste and two sets of rations glaring up at him from the tray. Shinji ate every bit, keen on keeping his strength, and tried not to grimace at the chlorine aftertaste the water left behind.  
仿佛过了几个小时，食物终于端了上来，托盘上依旧是那些糊状物和两份口粮，直勾勾地盯着他。真嗣吃掉了每一口，专注于保持体力，并尽量不因水中的氯气余味而皱眉。

"Sacred." The roundel danced in his pocket. "Worthy of respect or dedication."  
"神圣。" 圆章在他的口袋里跳动。"值得尊敬或奉献。"

"Hey!" “嘿！”

A sudden loud clang made Shinji hiss and sit up, he glanced at the gate and almost recoiled. Ten or more sailors stood around the cell, all glowering at him. Some brandished large wrenches, knives, or metal tubes. The burly one who had struck his stomach approached, and slammed his wrench on the gate again.  
突然一声巨响让真嗣倒吸一口凉气，坐了起来，他瞥了一眼大门，几乎要退缩。十几个水手围在牢房周围，全都怒目而视。有些人挥舞着大扳手、刀子或金属管。那个曾击打他腹部的魁梧男子走上前来，再次用扳手猛击大门。

"Don't get too comfortable there, runt," the man said through the comm. "All of us here lost people fourteen years ago, all because of your hissy fit. Some of us lost people in this latest act of stupidity of yours." the wrench clashed against metal once more. "You got any words for any of them?"  
"别在那里太舒服了，小鬼，" 那人通过通讯器说道。"我们这里所有人都因为十四年前你的那次发脾气失去了亲人，有些人还因为你最近的愚蠢行为失去了亲人。" 扳手再次撞击金属。"你有什么话要对这些人说吗？"

"Like any words will change a thing," a woman he did not recognize interjected. "Especially coming from this brat. Can you even speak? Hey, I'm talking to you!"  
"说再多的话也改变不了什么，"一个他不认识的女人插话道，"尤其是从这个小鬼嘴里说出来。你会说话吗？嘿，我在跟你说话呢！"

"I," Shinji paused. "I'm sorry. Nothing I say will make things better, nor will it bring back those you have lost. You're right to despise me," he said, and offered a deep bow. "If hitting or insulting me lightens that burden in the slightest, please go ahead."  
"我，"真嗣顿了顿，"我很抱歉。我说什么都不会让事情好转，也无法让你们失去的人回来。你们有理由恨我，"他说着，深深鞠了一躬，"如果打我或骂我能稍微减轻你们的负担，请尽管动手。"

The woman with strange pink hair snarled, turned back and motioned for the rest of the crew members to disband. The majority glared down at him, some spat on the ground or the crystal wall. The large sailor slammed the wrench on the gate one final time.  
那个有着奇怪粉色头发的女人咆哮着，转身示意其他船员散开。大多数人瞪着他，有的朝地上或水晶墙吐口水。那个高大的水手最后重重地用扳手砸了一下大门。

"All you have to do is die at the proper time," Kitakami ordered, arms crossed. "Your words are nothing, Ikari. We brought you along to keep whatever sickness you have from spreading in our home. So long as I live, I'll never let you see Village 3 again."  
"你只需在适当的时候死去，"北上命令道，双臂交叉。"你的话毫无意义，碇。我们带你来是为了防止你身上的疾病在我们家中蔓延。只要我活着，我绝不会让你再见到第三村。"

Shinji offered no response; he simply kept his head and body bowed until they all retreated. In the fog that was his first arrival, hardly anyone but Asuka had neared his cage. _They been cooped up in here, working, suffering through endless battles while I was off at their home, enjoying the hospitality of their families._  
真嗣没有回应；他只是保持低头弯身的姿势，直到他们全部离开。在他初次到来的迷雾中，除了明日香，几乎没有其他人接近过他的笼子。他们被困在这里，工作，忍受着无休止的战斗，而我却在他们的家中，享受着他们家庭的款待。

"Think of an impossible thing," Shinji recited. It had been Viko's cryptic advice. "Break it down into a series of smaller tasks, tasks you think you can manage, and complete them one by one. Little by little." He stuck the roundel to his undershirt, close to his heart. "You'll reach a cliff, and then you'll have to decide whether to take the leap, or step back and walk away."  
"想象一件不可能的事，"真嗣复述道。这是维科的神秘建议。"将其分解成一系列你认为自己能完成的小任务，然后逐一完成。一点一点地。"他将圆盘贴在自己的内衣上，靠近心脏的位置。"你会到达一个悬崖，然后你必须决定是跳下去，还是退后离开。"

Unit 01 called to Shinji from afar. Mother was waiting, and somewhere… somewhere, he heard Ayanami whisper his name. His hands clenched. "I'll take that leap, even if they don't want me to. There are things I need to protect."  
初号机从远处呼唤着真嗣。母亲在等待，而某个地方……某个地方，他听见绫波轻声呼唤他的名字。他的双手紧握。“我会迈出那一步，即使他们不希望我这么做。有些东西我必须守护。”

Kaworu's shadow watched from the corner, smiling. "You have found happiness, my friend," he said, too quietly for Shinji to hear. "I pray that you get to enjoy more of it."  
渚薰的影子从角落里注视着，微笑着。“你已经找到了幸福，我的朋友，”他轻声说道，声音小到真嗣听不见。“我祈祷你能享受更多。”

---

"Pray." “祈祷。”

One of the sailors scoffed and drank from the worn wineskin. He grimaced, slamming the drink on the next man's chest. "Pray for summer, pray for rain, pray for peace," he continued. "Remember when we believed in all that nonsense? Prayer, hope, justice, logic. Turns out it's a big game between interdimensional monsters and us humans."  
其中一名水手嗤之以鼻，从磨损的酒囊中喝了一口。他皱着眉头，将酒囊猛地砸在旁边人的胸口。“祈求夏天，祈求雨水，祈求和平，”他继续说道，“还记得我们曾相信那些胡言乱语吗？祈祷、希望、正义、逻辑。结果发现这只是跨维度怪物和我们人类之间的一场大游戏。”

The one they all referred to as 'gunner' stole the wineskin, and invited himself to three long gulps before throwing it behind him. "Ah, Viko's fire water. Nothing like a little taste of home, eh, boys? To remind us what we fight for."  
他们口中的‘炮手’抢过酒囊，自顾自地连喝了三大口，然后将其抛到身后。“啊，维科的烈酒。没有什么比家乡的一小口更能提醒我们为何而战了，对吧，伙计们？”

"What we're about to die for, you mean," said the pilot. "We should've just strapped Unit 01 with every explosive we have, and shipped it straight to Ikari's lair. Tsk, like _that_ would work."  
“你是说我们即将为之牺牲的东西吧，”飞行员说道，“我们本该把零号机装满所有炸药，直接送到碇的巢穴去。啧，那样做有用才怪。”

"It would appear God does exist," added the largest of them. He was next to drink, and sighed in contentment after the fermented elixir burned down his throat. "He sided with the monsters of humanity, is all." Another swig, longer. "Heh, I remember when we first found that blonde rascal."  
"看来上帝确实存在，"其中个子最高的补充道。他紧接着喝了一口，满足地叹息，当发酵的佳酿灼烧过喉咙时。"他只是站在了人类的怪物那一边，仅此而已。"又是一大口，更久。"嘿，我还记得我们第一次发现那个金发小子的情景。"

"I remember what we found around him more," the oldest said. "How many corpses were there? Ten, twelve?"  
"我记得更多的是他周围的情形，"最年长的说。"有多少尸体来着？十个，十二个？"

"Fifteen," said the large one.  
"十五个，"高个子回答道。"

"Fifteen. He bashed their heads in with a rock while they slept, one by one. Used the sound of the storm to hide his tracks. How many were on his survival team?"  
"十五岁。他在他们熟睡时用石头一个接一个地砸碎了他们的头。利用风暴的声音掩盖自己的行踪。他的生存团队有多少人？"

"Thirty, maybe more," Koji said. He refused the alcohol, and instead passed it over to one of the younger deckhands. "There wasn't much left. Kid probably tracked them down for days, weeks even, waiting for the right time."  
"可能有三十人，甚至更多，" 小吉说。他拒绝了酒精，而是将其递给了一名年轻的船员。"所剩无几了。那孩子可能追踪了他们好几天，甚至几周，等待合适的时机。"

"And now he's a gardener," the pilot chuckled. He shook his head, blinking heavily. "What happened to his camp, his people?"  
"而现在他成了园丁，" 飞行员轻声笑道。他摇了摇头，眨眼间显得沉重。"他的营地，他的人们怎么了？"

"They ate them." “他们吃了他们。”

None of the crew members dared to breathe too heavily after Koji spoke. They stared at one another, dread darkening their gazes.  
在小吉开口后，船员们没有一个敢呼吸得太重。他们彼此对视，恐惧在目光中加深。

"His brother tried to fight them off and give the group time to escape. He was overwhelmed, but killed about half of them before being taken out," he said. Something moved around the corner just as more of the crew members started nodding off. "Kid's group had elders, injured. Children. They killed the ones who couldn't walk on the spot, and used the rest for… well, you know."  
“他的兄弟试图抵抗他们，为团队争取逃跑时间。他被压倒了，但在被制服前杀死了大约一半的人，”他说。就在更多的船员开始打瞌睡时，有什么东西在拐角处移动。“那孩子的团队里有老人、伤员和儿童。他们当场杀死了那些无法行走的人，并利用剩下的人进行……嗯，你知道的。”

Not ten minutes afterwards, all seven men were snoring, slumped onto one another or curled up against a wall. "Damn," Koji picked up the wineskin and sniffed the lid. "Can't even smell the difference. Five to six hours under, takes about an hour for it to work. All we need now is a proper time to toast. That'll be easy enough, but the rest…" he shook his head. "No casualties, huh, Viko."  
不出十分钟，七个人全都鼾声大作，有的瘫倒在一起，有的蜷缩在墙边。“该死，”小吉拿起酒囊，闻了闻盖子。“连味道都闻不出来。五到六个小时后才会生效，大约需要一个小时才能起作用。我们现在只需要一个合适的时机来庆祝。这倒不难，但剩下的……”他摇了摇头。“没有伤亡，是吧，维科。”

_He who fights monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster,_ Takao thought as he exited the chamber, leaving the men to rest. No casualties. No lives lost, not even those willing to harm Shinji, or worse. The small boy Mari had saved all those years ago had grown into a better man than he himself could ever hope to be.  
与怪物战斗的人，应当小心自己不要成为怪物，高尾一边想着一边走出房间，留下那些人休息。没有伤亡。没有生命损失，甚至那些愿意伤害真嗣，或者更糟的人也没有。多年前被玛丽救下的小男孩，已经成长为一个比他自己所能希望的更好的人。

_And if thou gaze long into the abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.  
当你凝视深渊时，深渊也在凝视你。_

The empty sockets of Evangelion Unit 13 stared down at him.  
福音战士 13 号机空洞的眼窝俯视着他。

"My wish," Gendo muttered. The wind was picking up. Activity had been detected in the vicinity of Katsuragi's sorry little haven, signaling the final stage of his scenario. "My wish… may not be her wish."  
“我的愿望，”碇源堂喃喃自语。风势正在增强。在葛城那可怜的小避难所附近检测到了活动迹象，预示着他计划的最终阶段。“我的愿望……可能并非她的愿望。”

With all stations on high alert, the Adams fully equipped, and his mighty weapon 'sealed', the trap was set. The foolish crew of the Wunder believed they could face him head-on, some were blind enough to believe in victory. _As it stands, all you are accomplishing is giving me the last two pieces I required_.  
所有站点高度警戒，亚当们全副武装，而他强大的武器‘被封印’，陷阱已经布下。Wunder 号的愚蠢船员们以为能正面迎战他，有些人盲目到相信胜利。事实上，你们所做的只是给了我最后两块我需要的拼图。

The remnants of the Ninth Angel which rested within the Second Child, and Unit 01's core were both being brought to him. Given Shikinami's programming, she would be the first to jump into battle, as she always did. Once Unit 13 was complete, retrieving Yui was but a minor logistics issue.  
第九使徒的残骸，以及寄宿在二号适格者体内的初号机核心，都被送到了他面前。考虑到式波的程序设定，她将一如既往地率先投入战斗。一旦十三号机完成，找回唯就只是个后勤问题了。

Then, why was there uncertainty in his chest?  
那么，为何他的心中充满了不确定？

"_The Third Child has boarded the Wunder. He is being detained in a high security cell."_  
第三适格者已登上 Wunder 号。他现被羁押于高度安全牢房中。

Gendo's hand clenched, but he caught himself before the tic manifested completely. More images flooded his brain. Yui, holding a newborn Shinji. Yui, comforting the boy as he cried. Yui, smiling. A man with the power of God and Creation should not fear anything, and yet fear remained in him, dormant but alive.  
源堂的手紧握成拳，但他及时控制住自己，没有让那抽搐完全显现。更多的画面涌入他的脑海。唯，怀抱着新生的小真嗣。唯，安慰着哭泣的男孩。唯，微笑着。一个拥有神之力和创造力的男人不应畏惧任何事物，然而恐惧依旧潜伏在他内心，虽沉睡却依然存在。

"Wait for me," he repeated. "Just a little more, and this cursed existence will make sense again."  
“等我，”他重复道，“再稍等片刻，这被诅咒的存在将再次变得有意义。”

Rei Ayanami's name had long since lost any significance to him. They were means to an end, so why did he suddenly think of her, and her attempt to make dinner, so many years before? His expression never changed; his dead gaze never wavered from the Evangelion. Regardless, the thoughts festered.  
绫波零的名字对他早已失去了意义。她们只是达成目的的手段，但为何他突然想起了她，以及多年前她尝试做饭的那一幕？他的表情未曾改变；他那死寂的目光始终未曾从福音战士上移开。尽管如此，这些思绪却在心中滋生。

_Fear_, Gendo Ikari mused. _An unpleasant emotion caused by the belief that someone or something is dangerous, likely to cause pain, or a threat_.  
恐惧，碇源堂暗自思忖。一种不愉快的情绪，源于相信某人或某物危险，可能造成痛苦，或构成威胁。

"Nonsense," he grated. "The scenario is inevitable. Nothing the boy attempts will matter once the Second Child is procured. Not that he will attempt anything."  
“胡说八道，”他咬牙切齿地说，“情况不可避免。一旦第二适格者到手，那小子做什么都无关紧要。他也不会试图做什么。”

_The boy has no self-agency; I made certain of it. He is no more of a threat than a butterfly trying to battle hurricane winds.  
那孩子没有自主权；我确保了这一点。他比起一只试图与飓风抗衡的蝴蝶，威胁还要小。_

Unwavering as the beast before him, Gendo stared into the abyss. Every time it stared back, a small chill ran down his spine. Fighting the old tic of clenching his hands grew increasingly difficult. Memories returned, too vague to remind Gendo what being human meant. He suppressed all remnants of emotion with a long, deep breath.  
如同面前那头坚定不移的野兽，碇源堂凝视着深渊。每当深渊回望，他脊背便掠过一丝寒意。克制住紧握双手的老习惯愈发困难。记忆回潮，却模糊得无法提醒碇源堂何为人性。他深吸一口气，压抑下所有情感的残余。

"My wish may not be her wish." Crimson glistened under Gendo's visor. "No matter. I will reclaim what was taken from me, to whatever end."  
“我的愿望未必是她的愿望。”鲜红在碇源堂的面罩下闪烁。“无妨。无论结果如何，我都要夺回被夺走的一切。”

---

"To whatever end." “无论结果如何。”

Mari nodded and raised her glass. It was hard to keep secrets from Asuka, but the Puppy's gift had been a welcoming distraction. She had been able to exit the cell with the most generic excuse, and gotten half a nod at best.  
玛丽点了点头，举起她的杯子。对明日香保守秘密很难，但小狗的礼物却是一个令人愉快的干扰。她用最普通的借口离开了牢房，最多只得到了半个点头。

"Run. Survive, and cling onto life," Viko said from the shadows. "I'll hold them off, to whatever end. You are loved, my brother. Never forget that."  
“跑。活下去，紧紧抓住生命，”维科从阴影中说道，“我会拖住他们，无论付出什么代价。你是我所爱的兄弟，永远不要忘记这一点。”

"You kept repeating the same thing over and over again when we found you," Mari whispered. Her cheery demeanor was gone, replaced by a somber, sorrowful gaze. "Were those his last words to you?"  
“我们找到你时，你一直在重复同样的话，”玛丽低声说。她那欢快的神情消失了，取而代之的是一种忧郁、悲伤的目光。“那些是他对你说的最后的话吗？”

"Yes." The man's eyes hardened. "It's strange, seeing you again after these many years, and finding you mostly unchanged. Same with Captain Shikinami," he murmured, smiling. "I've missed you, Miss Mari. I did as you and old man Aida told me."  
"是的。" 男人的眼神变得坚定。"这么多年后再次见到你，发现你几乎没变，真是奇怪。同样的情况也发生在式波·明日香身上，"他低声说道，微笑着。"我很想念你，真希波小姐。我按照你和老 Aida 的吩咐去做了。"

"I know," Mari replied. She sat on a nearby box, legs swinging up and down. "I hear your forest is quite the sight to behold." Light returned to her eyes. "I told you, there are no impossible things. Not really."  
"我知道，" 真希波回答道。她坐在旁边的箱子上，双腿上下摆动。"我听说你的森林非常壮观。" 她的眼中重新闪烁着光芒。"我告诉过你，没有什么是不可能的。真的没有。"

"True, time proved you right." Viko chuckled. "You were also right about our Captain. Funny how light emerges from the darkest places. She could barely mask her concern throughout the first days."  
"确实，时间证明了你是对的。" Viko 轻笑道。"你也说对了我们队长的事。有趣的是，光明总是从最黑暗的地方涌现。她在最初的日子里几乎掩饰不住她的担忧。"

"Hah! See? Told you! And yeah, well… you can't blame her, the Princess is a terrible liar," commented Mari. "She's good at keeping that wall up, though. It must have been hard for the Puppy to climb over it."  
"哈！看吧？我就说嘛！而且，呃…你也不能怪她，公主可真是个糟糕的说谎者，"玛丽评论道。"不过她很擅长维持那堵墙。小狗要翻过去肯定不容易。"

"I'd say she made it as easy for him as she possibly could, given the circumstances," Viko said with another laugh. "They both started to walk, and met halfway. Certainly, something worthy of protecting and nurturing."  
"我觉得她已经尽可能地为他创造了便利，考虑到情况，"维科笑着说。"他们俩都开始走，然后在中间相遇。这绝对是值得守护和培养的东西。"

"My scenario is not a tree you can water and trim, Vi-kun," Mari threatened jokingly. "But I'm happy you played your part. I always told Takao you were a nice boy." She smiled, mischief glistened in her eyes. "Now, tell me all about those little fishing excursions! And did the Princess really plant a tree?"  
"我的设想可不是一棵你能浇水修剪的树，维君，"玛丽开玩笑地威胁道。"但我很高兴你扮演了你的角色。我总是告诉高尾你是个好孩子。"她微笑着，眼中闪烁着调皮的光芒。"现在，给我讲讲那些小小的钓鱼之旅吧！还有，公主真的种了一棵树吗？"

"Not only one, she planted _four_," Viko revealed with a bright smile. "And she checked on Shinji's tree at least once every two days. Named it and everything. Can you figure out its name?"  
"不止一棵，她种了四棵，" Viko 带着灿烂的笑容透露道，"而且她至少每两天就会去看一次真嗣的树。还给它起了名字，你能猜到叫什么吗？"

---

"Something boring, huh." "听起来挺无聊的。"

Sitting in the cell by herself started to grate on Asuka's nerves. The ticker was running again in her mind, only not even the games managed to derail her thoughts. Her stomach grumbled, and her eye kept wandering over to the vase. _Forgot to make a bento for my own damn self. How more pathetic can you get, Asuka?_  
独自坐在牢房里开始让明日香感到烦躁。心中的计时器再次启动，连游戏都无法转移她的思绪。她的肚子咕咕叫，眼睛不时瞟向花瓶。居然忘记给自己准备便当了。还能更可悲吗，明日香？

A single bit of turbulence and the clay would break into pieces, the water would spoil on the books and the flowers would wither quicker, perhaps even get crushed. _Stupid Four-eyes. Why did she have to bring the vase here? Like knowing the dumb little cups are in my bag isn't embarrassing enough._  
只要一点颠簸，那陶器就会碎成片，水会浸湿书本，花也会更快枯萎，甚至可能被压坏。愚蠢的四眼仔。她干嘛非得把花瓶带到这里来？光是知道我包里那些小笨杯子就已经够丢脸的了。

The roundel danced in between her fingers; she had been playing with it ever since Mari had departed. _I still haven't figured out what exactly he needs to do,_ she thought. _What's with his fixation with this little thing, anyway? I thought the blue one would be more… appropriate for him. What? I'm about to go lose again, probably for the last time, and all I can think about is that stupid promise._  
圆章在她指间跳跃；自从玛丽离开后，她一直在玩弄它。我还没弄清楚他到底需要做什么，她想。他为什么对这个小东西如此执着？我以为蓝色的那个对他来说会更……合适。什么？我可能又要输了，或许是最后一次，而我满脑子都是那个愚蠢的承诺。

"Old enough to drink, what a joke," Asuka grumbled, arms crossed. "Fourteen years and I never bothered trying it. Now I'm supposed to wait four more years? Pfft. I doubt I even have four more days."  
“老到可以喝酒，真是个笑话，”明日香嘟囔着，双臂交叉。“十四年了我都没试过，现在却要我再等四年？哼，我怀疑我连四天都撑不过。”

Unease continued to gnaw at her senses, fueled by hunger and a growing discomfort at being in the cell. She found herself missing the ocean breeze. Instead of battle tactics, she pondered on whether her Brat Trees would survive the coming storms. Instead of running through the schematics of Unit 02's repairs, she recalled the few holes and cracks in Shinji's makeshift kitchen.  
不安感持续啃噬着她的感官，饥饿和日益加剧的囚室不适感加剧了这种情绪。她发现自己怀念起海风。她不再思考战术，而是担忧她的布拉特树能否挺过即将到来的风暴。她不再反复琢磨二号机的维修方案，而是回忆起真嗣那个简陋厨房里的几处破洞和裂缝。

"That's it, screw this." “就这样，去他的。”

Asuka jumped to her feet, stored three sets of rations in her jacket, pulled the hoodie over her head and exited the cell. If she could not waltz into the idiot's cage like before, there was the marvelous excuse of ensuring he was not starving.  
明日香猛地站起身，往夹克里塞了三份口粮，拉上连帽衫的帽子，走出了囚室。如果她不能再像以前那样大摇大摆地走进那傻瓜的笼子，那么确保他不挨饿便是一个绝妙的借口。

_Yeah, look away. Don't stare too long, or I just might feel like electrocuting you,_ she thought. The way she had picked up the idiot and helped carry him inside the ship had cemented her as an ally to their enemy. _Like I care. Remembering I had to do that makes me sick. So, you can all collectively suck on a lime._  
是啊，别看太久。不然我可能会觉得想电死你，她心想。她把那个白痴捡起来并帮忙把他抬进船内的举动，已经让她成为了他们敌人的盟友。就像我在乎一样。想起我不得不这么做就让我恶心。所以，你们都可以集体去啃个柠檬。

She was one corner away from Shinji's cell when the whispers filtered through her tired mind. Asuka paused mid-step after catching the word 'Third'. She caught a few insults, but what unsettled her was the mention of the DSS choker. More murmurs, something about Unit 01's core, Ayanami's name, then silence.  
她离真嗣的牢房只差一个拐角时，耳边传来了窃窃私语。听到“第三”这个词时，明日香停下了脚步。她听到了几句侮辱，但让她不安的是提到了 DSS 项圈。更多的低语，关于初号机核心、绫波的名字，然后是沉默。

"Go ahead and try," Asuka growled venomously. "See if I don't accidentally step on you."  
“尽管试试看，”明日香恶狠狠地咆哮道，“看我会不会不小心踩到你。”

Mutiny and the possibility of taking lives could wait. Her stomach growled again as she approached the gate and punched in the security code. Shinji was sitting on the cot, reading the dumb dictionary when she entered, and caught the protein bar when she threw it at him.  
叛乱和夺命的可能性可以暂且搁置。她走近大门，输入安全码时，肚子又咕噜作响。她进门时，看到真嗣坐在床边，正读着那本愚蠢的字典，她扔过去的蛋白棒被他稳稳接住。

"Eat," Asuka commanded, more out of habit than anything else, then produced her own bar and took a bite. "How's the stomach?"  
“吃吧，”明日香命令道，更多是出于习惯而非其他，然后拿出自己的蛋白棒咬了一口。“肚子怎么样了？”

"Hi, thank you," Shinji said. His smile lessened her unease. "I'm okay. The skin's a little tender, that's all."  
“嗨，谢谢，”真嗣说道。他的微笑减轻了她的不安。“我还好。就是皮肤有点儿疼，仅此而已。”

The horror of his infected wrist manifested, then the sight of his hands, raw and riddled with small bandages after days of dicing and carrying wood. Disgust kept her from taking a second bite. "That shouldn't have happened," she admitted through gritted teeth. "It's the stupidest security requirement ever conceived, considering you're wearing that choker."  
他感染的手腕带来的恐惧显现出来，接着是他那双粗糙、布满小绷带的手，那是几天来切菜和搬运木头的结果。厌恶感让她无法再咬第二口。“这本不该发生的，”她咬牙切齿地承认，“考虑到你戴着那个项圈，这简直是史上最愚蠢的安全要求。”

Shinji's gaze held no resentment towards her, which only worsened her sudden nausea. "I'm sorry you had to do that," he replied, which earned him a disgruntled sigh. "Did you… uhm-" he scratched at the scar on his wrist. "Were the flowers a dumb thing to do?"  
真嗣的目光中没有对她的一丝怨恨，这反而加剧了她突如其来的恶心感。“对不起，你不得不这么做，”他回答，这换来了一声不满的叹息。“你……呃——”他挠了挠手腕上的伤疤。“送花是不是很蠢？”

"Duh." Asuka shrugged, forcing herself to eat. Shinji followed suit and finished his protein bar in three hungry bites. "They're just going to wither away, not to mention half the stupid village wanted to clap or something."  
“当然。”明日香耸耸肩，强迫自己继续吃。真嗣也跟着做，三口就把蛋白棒吃完了。“它们只会凋谢，更别提半个村子的人都想鼓掌还是怎么的。”

"Oh." "哦。"

"Whatever, not like I care what they think," she was quick to add, which drew his eyes back to her. "Nobody's ever given me flowers before, not even those dumb boys at school all those years ago. And I don't just go around hugging people, either. So try and put two and two together, idiot."  
"随便啦，我又不在乎他们怎么想，"她迅速补充道，这让他再次将目光投向她。"从来没有人送过我花，就连那些年学校里的笨男生也没有。而且我也不会随便去拥抱别人。所以试着把这两件事联系起来，笨蛋。"

"Oh," Shinji said, then blinked. "Oh!"  
"哦，"真嗣说，然后眨了眨眼。"哦！"

_Yeah, dummy,_ Asuka thought. Color rose to her cheeks. _I liked the stupid flowers, okay! I wouldn't mind if you find more, somehow, and give them to me! Ugh!_  
是啊，傻瓜，明日香心想。她的脸颊泛起了红晕。我喜欢那些蠢花，行了吧！要是你还能找到更多，然后送给我，我也不会介意的！呃！

They descended into a comfortable silence. After minutes of her standing, Shinji scooted over and she sat to his left, with her uncovered side to him. She took the offered earphone and felt her tense muscles relax as the tune began to play.  
他们陷入了一种舒适的沉默。在她站立了几分钟后，真嗣挪了挪位置，她便坐在他的左边，未被覆盖的一侧对着他。她接过递来的耳机，随着音乐响起，她紧绷的肌肉开始放松。

_We're riding to our doom, the crew is watching like vultures, and I couldn't care less.  
我们正驶向毁灭，船员们像秃鹫一样盯着，而我毫不在乎。_

"Not much battery left," Shinji murmured. The tape rewound. "I wonder how the penguins are doing. The trees, too."  
“电量不多了。” 真嗣喃喃道。磁带倒带声响起。“不知道企鹅们怎么样了。还有那些树。”

"Eh, they'll be fine," responded Asuka. "Bet your idiot tree's got a few new leaves and everything."  
“哎，它们会没事的，” 明日香回应道。“我打赌你那棵笨树肯定长出了几片新叶子什么的。”

"Ryoji's probably watching over yours like a hawk."  
“阿光大概像老鹰一样盯着你那棵树呢。”

"He better, if he knows what's good for him."  
"他最好知道什么对他有好处。"

"Hey, Asuka." "嘿，明日香。"

"What?" “什么？”

"Thanks for coming to see me. I was feeling a bit lonely."  
"谢谢你来看我。我感到有点孤单。"

"I'm just making sure you don't puke all over yourself, like last time. Shut up about it, already. You're wasting battery power."  
"我只是确保你不会像上次那样吐得满身都是。别再提了，你这是在浪费电池电量。"

"Right. Sorr-uhm," Shinji shifted his weight on the cot. The distance between them reduced. "I really like this song."  
"对。对不——呃，" 真嗣在床上调整了一下姿势，两人之间的距离缩短了。"我真的很喜欢这首歌。"

"Heh." Asuka's dry chuckle resonated in the cell. "I wouldn't have guessed it from the five hundred times you've listened to it. What's so special about it?"  
"呵呵。" 明日香在牢房里发出干涩的笑声。"我可没想到，你都听了五百遍了。这首歌有什么特别的？"

"It was in the tape for… for as long as I've had this," Shinji explained, chuckling. "But somehow, it was jammed? I don't really know why it suddenly started working."  
"这卷带子... 自从我有了它就一直在这里，" 真嗣解释道，轻声笑了起来。"但不知怎么的，它卡住了？我不太明白为什么突然又开始工作了。"

"Not a terrible piece," she said. Her body unwound, aching to lean on Shinji and fall into a deep slumber. "Where did you get that old box, anyway?"  
"不是一件糟糕的作品，" 她说。她的身体放松下来，渴望靠在真嗣身上，沉沉睡去。"话说回来，你从哪儿弄到那个旧盒子的？"

Shinji smiled. "It was my father's."  
真嗣微笑着。"那是我父亲的。"

_Well, at least someone is having fun is this damned ship.  
好吧，至少有人在这该死的船上玩得开心。_

Ritsuko punched the numbers into one of many small computers in her vicinity. Regardless of how many codes she tried, Unit 01's mainframe was blocked. The Eva's core remained sealed, giving away no readings aside from the latest spike, and providing nothing but pure energy.  
律子将数字输入她周围众多小型电脑之一。无论她尝试多少代码，零号机的主机都被封锁了。Eva 的核心依然封闭，除了最近的能量峰值外，没有提供任何读数，只释放出纯粹的能量。

"It's blocking the signals," she said to Maya. The girl's head perked up in surprise. "None of this is random. It gave us enough access to pretend this whole self-destruct charade for a reason. It spiked alongside Unit 13 for a reason."  
“它在屏蔽信号，”她对真希波说。女孩惊讶地抬起头。“这一切都不是随机的。它给了我们足够的权限来假装这场自毁闹剧是有原因的。它与 13 号机同步爆发也是有原因的。”

"So, it's stringing us along," Maya replied, emptying a tiny bottle of recycled water. "Do you think it's malicious, Senpai? What Ikari is planning?"  
"所以，它是在吊我们胃口，" 真希波回答道，倒空了一小瓶回收水。"你觉得这是恶意的吗，前辈？碇司令到底在计划什么？"

"Yui? Unlikely." Ritsuko produced another box of mints and offered one to her friend. "From what I know, she wasn't anything like her husband. Maybe this was all meant to be in some grand machination we can't understand, maybe she's just winging it as we are."  
"唯？不太可能。" 律子又拿出了一盒薄荷糖，递给朋友一颗。"据我所知，她和她丈夫完全不同。也许这一切都是某种我们无法理解的宏大计划，也许她就像我们一样，只是随机应变罢了。"

"How's the whole 'plan B' coming along?" Maya inquired. "Considering everything else that's happening, it feels more like an unpleasant distraction than a threat of doom."  
"那个'B 计划'进展如何？" 真希波问道。"考虑到其他正在发生的事情，这感觉更像是个令人不快的干扰，而不是什么末日威胁。"

_Not as good as I'd hoped, all things considered._ "Turns out our little band of rascals is less gullible than we thought, but we've identified every single one. You know the worst part? It's not completely a lie. The self-destruct system is indeed functional. Some crew members are trying to hack my files as we speak, trying to get the lock codes for the Entry Plug."  
并非如我所愿，综合考虑一切。事实证明，我们这群小淘气并不像我们想象中那么容易上当，但我们已经识别出了每一个。你知道最糟糕的部分吗？这并不完全是谎言。自毁系统确实功能正常。一些船员正在试图破解我的文件，试图获取插入栓的锁定代码。

Ritsuko's mask of stoicism peeled away for a few seconds, as teacher and student shared a concerned glance. "They're keeping tabs on the DSS trigger at all times, too," added Maya. "They're not even trying to disguise their disdain for the Captain at this point."  
律子的冷漠面具剥落了几秒钟，师生之间交换了一个关切的目光。"他们也在时刻关注 DSS 触发器，"真希波补充道。"他们甚至不再试图掩饰对舰长的蔑视。

"Asuka's sudden appreciation for spending time with our prisoner didn't go unnoticed, either." Closing the computer screen with more force than needed, Ritsuko fell back against the metal wall. "Wish I had a cigarette. I'm saving the last one for whatever conclusion this entire debacle takes us. Sometimes I wonder why I even chose this side," she said. "Then I remember. A world where tobacco leaves can grow again."  
明日香突然对与我们的囚犯共度时光的欣赏也没有被忽视。"用力关闭电脑屏幕，律子靠在金属墙上。"真希望我有一支烟。我留着最后一支，等待这场闹剧的结局。有时我怀疑自己为何选择这条路，"她说，"然后我想起来了。一个能让烟草再次生长的世界。

"Pfft," Maya giggled and rose to her feet. "Let's hope you get to enjoy that last cigarette of yours with some peace and quiet."  
"噗，" 真希笑出声来，站起身。"希望你能安安静静地享受那最后一根烟。"

"Ah, wouldn't that be a sight," Ritsuko said. The stringent flavor of burned tobacco danced on her lips with little effort. "Be a dear and make us some gruel, will you, Maya? There's still lots of work to do, and I can't focus on an empty stomach."  
"啊，那景象一定很美，" 律子说道。烧焦烟草的辛辣味道在她唇间轻舞。"亲爱的，给我们煮点粥吧，好吗？还有很多工作要做，空着肚子我可集中不了精神。"

"Should I get some of that fire water Viko made?" asked Maya from the door. "The crew says it's delicious."  
"要不要来点维克做的烈酒？" 真希在门口问道。"船员们都说那酒很美味。"

"Eh, maybe a couple of glasses to wash down the taste of sand," Ritsuko replied, smirking. "Make sure to get one of the wineskins marked red and blue."  
“呃，或许几杯酒能冲淡这沙子的味道。”律子回答，嘴角带着一丝笑意。“记得拿那个红蓝标记的酒囊。”

"Aye aye, Captain!" “遵命，船长！”

_Keh, I wouldn't wish that position on my worst enemy. Look at what happened to Misato; carbon copy of Ikari on the outside, broken beyond repair and dying on the inside._ The computer beeped, signaling yet another attempt to hack the Wunder's mainframe, this time one to change the security code in Shinji's cell. _Sometimes I wish you lot were more efficient in your sad little attempts,_ Ritsuko thought. Her eyes turned cold, deadly. _If you want to touch Shinji, you'll have to go through me, traitors._  
“哼，我可不希望我的死敌坐上那个位置。看看美里发生了什么；外表是碇的翻版，内心却支离破碎，奄奄一息。”电脑发出哔哔声，提示又一次试图入侵 Wunder 主机的行动，这次是要更改真嗣牢房的安全码。有时我真希望你们这些可怜的小尝试能更有效率些，律子心想。她的眼神变得冰冷，充满杀意。“如果你们想碰真嗣，就得先过我这关，叛徒们。”

"Ah, so you _do_ know what you're doing." She smiled. Unit 01's core spiked yet again. "Fate leads the willing and drags along the reluctant. Lead the way then, miss Yui."  
"啊，看来你确实知道自己在做什么。" 她微笑着。初号机的核心再次飙升。"命运引领愿意的人，拖着不愿的人前行。那么，请带路吧，Yui 小姐。"

"_Why are you always so cheerful?"_  
"你为什么总是这么开心？"

"_Hmm?"_  "嗯？"

"_You smile a lot, you never say no to people who ask for your help. You don't ever get mad at me. Why?"_  
"你总是微笑，从不拒绝求助的人。你从不对我生气。为什么？"

"_Well, life is too short to be angry or sad more than it's needed, little brother." A lime flew in his direction. "The trees appreciate a good energy. Helps them grow. Good music, as well. Remember that."_  
"嗯，生命太短暂，没必要过多地生气或悲伤，小弟弟。" 一个酸橙朝他飞来。"树木喜欢积极的能量。有助于它们的成长。还有好的音乐，也要记住。"

"_You didn't answer my question."_  
"你没有回答我的问题。"

"_Nor will I. All you need to know is that I've been sad for long enough, angry as well. But then, somebody brought this tiny little baby to the village, told me to look after it. Suddenly, I felt happiness again., and that's why every day I'm grateful, and I'm happy."_  
"我也不会。你只需要知道，我已经悲伤和愤怒了太久。但后来，有人把这个小婴儿带到村子里，让我照顾它。突然间，我又感受到了幸福，这就是为什么我每天心怀感激，感到快乐。"

"_Bah." He smiled. "You're lame, you know."_  
"哼。" 他微笑道，"你知道吗，你真是个瘸子。"

"_Hah!"_  "哈！"

Ryoji's eyes snapped open. He jumped out of bed and ran straight to the door, managing to take three full steps outside before Toji's arms wrapped from behind him.  
莲司的眼睛猛地睁开。他从床上跳下来，直奔门口，刚迈出三步，就被透二的胳膊从背后紧紧抱住。

"Let me go!" he screamed, and tried to elbow, scratch or bite the elder. "I have to go with him, let me go, god damn you!"  
“放开我！”他尖叫着，试图用肘击、抓挠或咬透二。“我必须跟他走，放开我，该死的！”

"They're gone, kid," Toji murmured in his ear, calm despite receiving several strikes. "The Wunder left about two hours ago. I'm sorry."  
“他们走了，小子，”透二在他耳边低语，尽管挨了几下，依然平静。“奇迹号大约两小时前离开了。我很抱歉。”

Knowing any more struggle was pointless, Ryoji forced himself to take a few deep breaths, then slowly descended into quiet sobs. "God damn it," he mumbled, punching the ground as he fell on his knees. "Why did he have to leave? This isn't what I wanted! How dare he leave like that! Damn it, damn it, damn it!"  
知道再挣扎也无济于事，莲司强迫自己深呼吸几次，然后缓缓陷入无声的啜泣。“该死，”他喃喃自语，跪倒在地，一拳捶向地面。“他为什么要离开？这不是我想要的！他怎么敢就这样离开！该死，该死，该死！”

"Because he loves you," Toji replied. He held the boy in a strong embrace. "He'll be back with your mother in tow, you'll see. When has Viko ever not kept his word?"  
“因为他爱你，”冬二回答道。他紧紧拥抱着男孩。“他会带着你母亲一起回来的，你会看到的。维科何时食言过？”

_I was supposed to be the one in danger, not him! People need him in this village!_ His mind screamed, yet Ryoji stayed quiet, glaring at the ground through falling tears. Long, silent minutes passed as he struggled to control his emotions. _Stupid! You're a stupid older brother!_  
"“本该是我处于危险之中，而不是他！村子里的人们需要他！”他的内心呐喊着，然而莲司保持沉默，透过泪水怒视着地面。漫长的寂静中，他努力控制自己的情绪。笨蛋！你这个笨蛋哥哥！”

"_Always try to help, in whichever way you can, that's what those who are strong do. Don't you want your mother to realize what a strong son she has?"_  
"总是尽力帮助，无论以何种方式，这是强者所为。你不希望你母亲意识到她有一个多么坚强的儿子吗？"

"Storm's coming," rasped Ryoji with a sigh. "Gotta go secure the seedlings, trim the old branches so they don't fall off and block the stream. Shinji's kitchen might get damaged, too."  
"暴风雨要来了，" 凌司嘶哑地叹息道。"得去固定幼苗，修剪老枝，以免它们掉落堵塞溪流。慎二的厨房也可能受损。"

"Yeah, you're right." The man's grip loosened bit by bit. "We don't have much time before the strong winds hit the barrier. Up for the task?"  
"是啊，你说得对。" 那人的手劲渐渐放松。"强风很快就会冲击屏障，我们时间不多了。准备好了吗？"

"Sure." Ryoji's shoulders dropped. "Do you really think they'll be okay? Viko, Shinji? My mom?"  
“当然。”莲二的肩膀放松下来。“你真的觉得他们会没事吗？维子、真治？还有我妈？”

"I'd be lying if I told you I know, but I can hope. So can you."  
“如果我说我知道，那是在骗你，但我可以抱有希望。你也可以。”

Nodding, Ryoji went back to his home to retrieve the tools. The carved rocks on the way inside eased his mind, the paintings and childish drawings that hung from the wall felt like a comforting blanket. There would be time to complain, cry, and demand explanations once his brother returned.  
莲二点点头，返回家中取工具。沿途雕刻的石头让他心情平静，墙上挂着的画和孩童涂鸦如同一条温暖的毯子。等哥哥回来后，有的是时间抱怨、哭泣和要求解释。

"Your word, huh." Ryoji picked the last stone they had been carving together. The characters for 'family' were etched in Cyrillic, barely legible, yet it reminded him of his own duty to the villagers. "If I had known you'd take it upon yourself to bring my mom here, I'd have gladly forgotten all about her. She's not my family, she doesn't even know me."  
"你的话，是吧。" 莲司捡起了他们一起刻的最后一块石头。上面用西里尔字母刻着‘家庭’二字，虽然模糊不清，却让他想起了自己对村民的责任。"如果我早知道你会自作主张把我妈带到这里，我宁愿忘了她。她不是我的家人，她甚至不认识我。"

_I'm not asking you not to be angry,_ Viko said in his mind. _Just give her a chance. You'd be amazed at how far we're willing to go for our family. Sometimes, the safety of those we love overshadows their happiness. You'll understand when you're older, little brother._  
我不是让你不要生气，维科在心里说。只是给她一个机会。你会惊讶于我们为了家人愿意走多远。有时候，我们所爱之人的安全比他们的幸福更重要。等你长大了，你会明白的，小弟。

"Well, I guess I can finally curse now," Ryoji said to the empty house. "Blyat."  
"好吧，我想我现在终于可以骂人了，" 莲司对着空荡荡的房子说。"妈的。"

Kensuke arrived with the jeep after he was done securing small tents over the Idiot Tree and the other saplings. They traveled in thick silence. Ryoji felt the commander's eyes dart careful glances at him, which he rebutted with a frown.  
在确保小帐篷牢固地覆盖在傻瓜树和其他树苗上后，健介开着吉普车赶来了。他们一路沉默，气氛沉重。凉二感觉到指挥官不时小心翼翼地瞥向他，而他则以皱眉回应。

Mud was thick around the fields, and with every passing hour the pooled water shook all around them. The Wanderers kept getting closer; two were already leaning on the barrier closest to the rice fields. Their footfalls echoed through the valley, feeling akin to horrible, deep bells that announced their doom.  
田野间的泥泞愈发厚重，随着时间的推移，积水在他们周围摇晃。流浪者们越来越近了；已有两人倚靠在离稻田最近的屏障上。他们的脚步声在山谷中回荡，宛如宣告厄运的可怕深沉钟声。

"We have to go," Kensuke said. He grabbed Ryoji's arm and hurried to the car after the first droplets fell on their coats. "The tents will hold. You did the knot Shikinami taught you, right?"  
“我们必须走了，”健介说道。他抓住凉二的手臂，在第一滴雨水落在他们的外套上后，急忙向车子跑去。“帐篷会撑住的。你打了志贵波教你的那个结，对吧？”

"Of course," Ryoji replied, heart hammering in his chest. Dread crept up his spine. "Mr. Kensuke, why are there so many of them?"  
"当然，" 莲司回答，心跳如鼓。恐惧沿着他的脊背爬升。"健介先生，为什么会有这么多？"

"They're probably trying to get away, as well," Kensuke answered. The car shook violently after a gust of wind and rain engulfed the village. "They're core energy, but some level of sentience has to be there. They know this is a safe place for life."  
"他们可能也在试图逃离，" 健介回答。一阵狂风暴雨席卷村庄，车子猛烈摇晃。"他们是核心能量，但一定程度的意识是存在的。他们知道这里是生命的避风港。"

"We'll be okay," Ryoji said with conviction, surprising both Kensuke and himself. "Shinji's with them. He won't let anything happen to Asuka's trees."  
"我们会没事的，" 莲司坚定地说，这让健介和他自己都感到惊讶。"真嗣和他们在一起。他不会让任何事情发生在明日香的大树上的。"

"Damn right he won't." Despite the horrible crunches the car was making or the way the earth rumbled, Kensuke gave Ryoji a calm, confident smirk. "Are you planning to tease them when they come back?"  
"当然不会。" 尽管车子发出可怕的嘎吱声，大地也在震动，健介却对辽露出平静而自信的微笑。"你打算等他们回来时取笑他们吗？"

"Endlessly." Ryoji's heart settled. "I might just name two of my seedlings 'blind fools' in their honor."  
"没完没了。" 辽的心安定了下来。"我可能会用他们的名义给两株幼苗取名为'瞎眼傻瓜'。"

They reached the shelter right before the storm picked up and ripped the wooden radio tower off the floor in one clean sweep. Children were crying, so Ryoji produced the football Viko had engineered out of old cloth, and started a football match.  
他们在风暴加剧并干净利落地将木制无线电塔从地面扯下之前到达了避难所。孩子们在哭泣，于是辽拿出了维克用旧布料制作的足球，开始了一场足球比赛。

Soon enough the workers joined. Amidst the chaos, the villagers held one another and hoped.  
不久，工人们也加入了。在混乱之中，村民们相互扶持，心怀希望。

---

"I'm sorry it came to this."  
“我很抱歉事情变成了这样。”

Shinji displayed no shock, no massive joy or sadness upon hearing his voice. "Don't be," he told Kaworu. "I'm the one who should apologize. I didn't listen."  
听到他的声音，真嗣没有表现出震惊，也没有巨大的喜悦或悲伤。“别这么说，”他对渚薰说，“我才是该道歉的那个。我没有听你的。”

"No. I was the one who spoke to you about the spears. I led you to the Evas. I thought… it would give you happiness."  
"不，是我和你谈起了长矛。我带你找到了 EVA。我以为……这会让你快乐。"

A smile. It cut through the angel's heart like a blade. "It did," Shinji replied. "I was given a chance; one I'm convinced I didn't deserve."  
一个微笑。它像刀刃一样刺穿了天使的心。“确实，”真嗣回答，“我得到了一个机会；一个我相信自己不配得到的机会。”

"How was your time in the village?" Kaworu asked. He sat to Shinji's right side, eyes darting to the small collection that rested on the cot. A red jacket, a small roundel, an old dictionary, and the familiar SDAT stared up at him. "You seem different than when we last met. You are lost no longer."  
"你在村子里的时光如何？"渚薰问道。他坐在真嗣的右侧，目光扫过放在床上的小物件。一件红色夹克，一个小圆徽章，一本旧词典，还有那熟悉的 SDAT 播放器，正凝视着他。“你似乎与我们上次见面时不同了。你不再迷失了。”

The ship began to shake as it reached Antarctica. AT Felds and the permanent hurricane built atop the pyramid clashed against the Wunder at full force, with the turbulence almost throwing the dictionary and roundel to the floor. Kaworu was caught off guard upon witnessing Shinji's quick reflexes. The boy pocketed the roundel, stored the dictionary and jacket under the thin mattress, and kept the SDAT firmly held in his hand.  
船只抵达南极时开始摇晃。AT 力场与永久性飓风在金字塔顶端形成的对抗，以全力冲击着奇迹号，湍流几乎将字典和圆徽甩到地板上。看到真嗣敏捷的反应，渚薰有些措手不及。少年将圆徽收入口袋，把字典和夹克塞在薄薄的床垫下，手中紧紧握着 SDAT。

"I _was_ lost," Shinji said. He had a rare, peaceful aura about him. "It was very painful at first. I didn't want to talk to anyone, or see anyone. I didn't want to eat, all I wanted was to stop existing. Then," he said, stifling a small laugh. "Something changed. I could feel the air, smell the soil, taste the food. I felt… welcomed. Valued. Nobody hated me, nobody was rude or mean. Well." They exchanged a glance and laughed. "Almost nobody."

Kaworu smiled back. "You seem to have found a place to rest, one you can call your own," he said. "You have forged ties that bind you, and will lead the way. We will meet again, my friend."  
渚薰回以微笑。“你似乎找到了一个可以安歇的地方，一个你可以称之为自己的地方，”他说，“你已经建立了联系，这些联系将引领你前行。我们还会再见面的，我的朋友。”

"You're right." Beneath Shinji's calm gaze lay the steel resolve Kaworu had hoped to see at least once more. "Thank you, Kaworu. Until then."  
"你说得对。" 在真嗣平静的目光下，隐藏着卡尔瓦里奥至少希望再次见到的坚定决心。"谢谢你，卡尔瓦里奥。直到那时。"

Unit 13 dragged him back to the core a second afterwards, not before he saw a familiar mane of red appear near the cell door. "God is in His Heaven," Kaworu whispered. The hungered Evangelion encased him within the core, however, it failed to rob him of the tranquility that washed over his soul. "All is right with the world."  
初号机 13 号随后将他拖回了核心，但在那之前，他看到了一抹熟悉的红色鬃毛出现在牢房门口。"上帝在他的天堂，"卡尔瓦里奥低语。虽然被饥饿的福音战士困在核心中，但他并未失去那股洗涤灵魂的宁静。"世界一切都好。"

---

"Don't you worry about a thing… 'cause every little thing is gonna be alright!"  
"别担心任何事……因为一切都会好起来的！"

_Just shut up, already,_ Asuka thought while rummaging through her duffle bag. The vase and cups were wrapped inside Shinji's jacket. Mari kept singing tune after tune, grating on her nerves once she settled into the chair. Her pulse was loud, stifling everything but the other pilot's voice. _I hate all of this. If I hadn't gone to that stupid village, I wouldn't mind walking into this losing battle._  
够了，闭嘴吧，明日香一边在她的行李袋里翻找一边想着。花瓶和杯子被包在真嗣的夹克里。真希波一首接一首地唱着歌，一旦她坐下，那声音就刺痛着她的神经。她的心跳声很大，压抑了其他一切，只剩下另一位驾驶员的声音。我讨厌这一切。如果我没去那个愚蠢的村庄，我也不会介意走进这场注定失败的战斗。

"Rise up this morning, smile with the rising su-"  
"清晨起身，对着升起的太阳微笑——"

"Stop that," Asuka grated. Strands of red hair began to fall into the ground_._ "Your accent is atrocious, it's worse than Misato's brat's."  
"别唱了，"明日香咬牙切齿地说。几缕红发开始落在地上。"你的口音太糟糕了，比美里那小鬼的还糟糕。"

"Come now, Princess," Mari replied, snickering. "You must have gotten used to my lovely voice by now. Maybe you'd rather Viko serenade you? Or better yet, the Puppy."  
"好了，公主，" 玛丽回答道，轻声笑了起来。"你到现在应该已经习惯我这美妙的声音了吧。或许你更愿意维科为你唱首歌？或者更好的是，让小狗来？"

Asuka's cheeks colored slightly. "You'd think so after fourteen years, but no. Your voice is as annoying as it was the day we met."  
明日香的脸颊微微泛红。"你以为过了十四年我会习惯，但并没有。你的声音还是和第一天见面时一样烦人。"

"But not as annoying as seeing the Puppy starve himself, or suffer from that nasty infection, hmm?" Mari's expert fingers maneuvered through her overgrown locks. "I heard you tased Koga's cousin until he soiled his trousers."  
"但总比看到小狗饿着自己，或是忍受那讨厌的感染要好，嗯？" 玛丽熟练的手指在她过长的发丝间穿梭。"我听说你用电击枪把古贺的表弟电到尿裤子了。"

_Stupid village, stupid gossip. Couldn't Kensuke keep his damn mouth shut for once? Now I have to put up with this nonsense.  
愚蠢的村庄，愚蠢的流言。难道就不能让健助闭上他的臭嘴一次吗？现在我得忍受这些胡言乱语。_

"He earned it, that's all you need to know," Asuka snapped. Crossing her arms, she glared at her own reflection, unchanged after so many years. "Not that it matters," she murmured. "Stupid hair. Nothing else changes in my body, but my hair keeps growing. How annoying."  
“他活该，你只需要知道这一点，”明日香厉声说道。她交叉双臂，瞪着自己的倒影，这么多年过去了，她依然未变。“反正也不重要，”她低声自语，“这该死的头发。我身体其他地方都没变，就头发一直在长。真烦人。”

"Gods, corruption, and desires," Mari murmured back. "They all dwell within the hair fibers. It embodies the chaos of the human mind. So, it's unequivocal proof that you are human, Princess, regardless of how you'd like to believe otherwise."  
“神明、腐败与欲望，”玛丽低声回应，“它们都寄宿在发丝之中。它体现了人类心灵的混乱。所以，公主，无论你多么希望相信自己不是，这都是你身为人类的明确证据。”

"Whatever," Asuka replied. A foolish idea blossomed in her mind. "Loan me those scissors when you're done, will you?"  
"随便啦，" 明日香回答道。一个愚蠢的念头在她脑海中萌生。"你用完了能把剪刀借我吗？"

"Absolutely! Just don't nip your fingers!" Mari gave her hair the final touches, and tapped her shoulders once when she was done. "Time to go fight, Your Highness."  
"当然可以！只是别剪到手指了！" 麻里给她的头发做了最后的修饰，完成后轻轻拍了拍她的肩膀。"该去战斗了，公主殿下。"

The singing resumed once they made their way to the changing room. Asuka stared at the boxes for a few minutes before opening one of them. "What's this supposed to be?"  
他们一走进更衣室，歌声又重新响起。明日香盯着那些箱子看了几分钟，然后打开了一个。"这是什么意思？"

"New plugsuits, designed to allow a deeper synch," Mari explained whilst changing. "They'll keep the corruption away, as well."  
“新型插入栓服，旨在实现更深层次的同步。”玛丽一边更换一边解释，“它们还能防止污染。”

_Like I need any help with 'corruption'._ Asuka's eye narrowed at the white material. "How nice of them, they gave us new clothes. We're just dressing up for own funerals."  
“好像我需要什么‘防污染’的帮助似的。”明日香眯起眼睛看着那白色材料，“他们真贴心，给了我们新衣服。我们只是在为自己打扮葬礼。”

Plugsuits had always been a second skin. She wore one even when it wasn't needed, she had worn the old suit Shinji had recognized during the retrieval mission, and yet this new one felt cold and unwelcoming. Securing the roundel near her DSS collar, she pressed the button.  
插入栓服一直是第二层皮肤。即使不需要时她也穿着，她穿着那件旧衣服，是真嗣在回收任务中认出的那件，然而这件新的却感觉冰冷而不友好。她固定好靠近 DSS 项圈的圆形徽章，按下了按钮。

Both suits compressed. Asuka nodded in Mari's direction, and they set out to their final destination before reaching the entry plugs. "Don't make it weird," she demanded while they floated towards Shinji's cage. "It's weird enough as it is."  
两套驾驶服紧贴着身体。明日香向真希的方向点头示意，她们便朝着最终目的地——插入栓前进了。“别搞得那么奇怪，”她一边漂向真嗣的笼子一边要求道，“已经够奇怪的了。”

"Finally ready to set the record straight with the Puppy? I thought you didn't have time for boys, Princess."  
“终于准备好和那只小狗说清楚了？我还以为你没时间应付男孩呢，公主。”

"The idiot needs a mother, not a girlfriend," Asuka lied. "Best to just get everything off my chest."  
“那白痴需要的是个妈，不是女朋友，”明日香撒谎道，“最好把一切都摊开来说清楚。”

"You didn't have to throw away the flowers," was Mari's reply. She grinned. "I saved some, just so you know. They'll dry well enough in between the book pages. You'll have to find which books contain them on your own, though."  
"你不必把花都扔掉，"玛丽回答道。她咧嘴一笑。"我留了一些，只是让你知道。它们夹在书页间会干得很好。不过，你得自己去找哪些书里有它们。"

"Yeah, right." Asuka shook her head in derision. The image of reading under a tree while the idiot snoozed on her lap manifested briefly. "Sounds really boring."  
"是啊，没错。"明日香不屑地摇了摇头。想象着在树下读书，而那个白痴在她腿上打盹的画面一闪而过。"听起来真的很无聊。"

Glares and fleeting glances followed the pair as they reached the cell. Considering she was likely to die in the coming hours, Asuka could not bring herself to care in the slightest. _You'll all be cheering once we go out there, or you better be, if you know what's good for you._ The ship itself felt cold, everything did. _The good thing about never being warm is that you don't miss what you don't know. Keh, what a waste._  
当两人到达牢房时，各种瞪视和一闪而过的目光紧随其后。考虑到自己可能在接下来的几个小时内死去，明日香根本不在乎。等我们出去时，你们最好都在欢呼，否则你们最好知道什么对你们有好处。船上感觉很冷，一切都冷冰冰的。从不温暖的好处是，你不会怀念你从未体验过的东西。哼，真是浪费。

Mari was quick to sneak up behind Shinji and wrap her arms around him, which elicited a growl from Asuka's throat.  
玛丽迅速地从背后接近真嗣，双臂环抱住他，这让明日香喉咙里发出了一声低吼。

"Hi!" Mari exclaimed. "Nice to finally have a chance to introduce myself, Shinji. Remember me? I'm Mari Illustrious Makinami. Glasses, big boobs, landed on you while at school? Ah, that sure was fun!" She sniffed around Shinji's neck. "Hmm, you smell like a grown-up!"  
"嗨！" 玛丽大声说道。"终于有机会向你介绍自己了，真嗣。还记得我吗？我是玛丽·伊丽莎白·麦克阿瑟。戴眼镜，大胸，在学校里落在你身上？啊，那真是太有趣了！" 她凑近真嗣的脖子嗅了嗅。"嗯，你闻起来像个成年人！"

"Yeah right, like someone can change that fast," Asuka growled.  
"得了吧，哪有人能变得那么快，" 明日香低声咆哮道。

"Uhm," Shinji started. His body tensed at the unannounced contact. "It's nice to meet you, Miss Mari."  
"呃，" 真嗣开口道。未经预告的接触让他身体紧绷。"很高兴见到你，真希小姐。"

"Say, you're sort of jumpy," Mari said. "It's okay, Puppy Ikari. I don't bite." She giggled. "Much."  
"话说，你有点紧张啊，" 真希说道。"没事的，小狗一护。我不会咬人的。" 她咯咯笑道。"顶多轻轻一下。"

_Alright, that's it. I'm killing her after I die._ Asuka's grow twitched, her glare was sufficiently intense to pry Mari off the idiot's body. "Yeah, real nice. Good introduction, Four-Eyes. Mind giving us some privacy, now?"  
好了，就这样。我死后一定要干掉她。明日香的眉头一皱，她的瞪视足以让真希从那个白痴身上移开。"是啊，真不错。介绍得挺好，四眼仔。现在能给我们点私人空间吗？"

"So mean, Princess," replied Mari with a feigned pout. "Turn that frown upside down, Puppy! We'll meet again soon. Now, you two behave!" She sprung off Shinji's cot and exited the cell, not before whispering in Asuka's ear. "All your, Princess. Be nice, will you? He's earned it."  
"真坏，公主殿下，"玛丽假装撅嘴回答。"别愁眉苦脸的，小狗！我们很快会再见面的。现在，你们俩乖乖的！"她从真嗣的床上跳下来，走出牢房，临走前在明日香耳边低语。"都是你的，公主。对他好点，好吗？他值得的。"

The door hissed closed, and they were alone.  
门嘶的一声关上了，他们独自留在里面。

"Your hair's too long, it looks stupid," Asuka said. She took the one available towel and threw it on Shinji's head. "Put that on, and don't move. I'm not too good with scissors, might just lop off an ear if you sneeze."  
"你的头发太长了，看起来很蠢，"明日香说。她拿起唯一的一条毛巾扔在真嗣头上。"把它戴上，别动。我剪刀用得不太好，万一你打喷嚏，可能会削掉一只耳朵。"

"Is that a new suit?" Shinji asked, doing as instructed. Sadness clouded his gaze as her fingers threaded through his hair. "There's been a lot of turbulence. Are we there?"  
"这是新西装吗？" 真嗣问道，按照指示做了。悲伤笼罩着他的目光，她的手指穿过他的头发。"最近风波不断。我们到了吗？"

"Almost. Little while left," Asuka responded. _Stupid suit is in the way, and I didn't bring a mirror. Great._ "New suit, yeah."  
"快了。还剩一小会儿，" 明日香回答道。这该死的西装碍事，我还没带镜子。真是糟糕。"新西装，没错。"

"Oh." Shinji tried to steal a glance, but she forced his head forward before he could. "It looks… nice, I guess."  
"哦。" 真嗣试图偷看一眼，但她在他能看之前就强迫他的头向前。"看起来……挺不错的，我想。"

"No, it doesn't." "不，不是的。"

"Okay, it doesn't." Shinji offered a tentative smile. "Sorry."  
"好吧，不是的。" 真嗣试探性地笑了笑。"对不起。"

"Whatever, it's not my color. Stop with the dumb apologies," she reprimanded. An empty food tray rested a few feet away. "Guess pushing those rations down your throat finally worked, huh."  
"随你怎么说，反正那颜色不适合我。别再傻乎乎地道歉了，" 她责备道。几英尺外放着一个空的食物托盘。"看来终于把那些补给品塞进你肚子里起作用了，是吧。"

"Yeah," Shinji replied with a chuckle. "I don't blame you for not wanting to eat, though. Not that I'm complaining, but… I miss the taste of fresh catch."  
"是啊，" 真嗣笑着回答，"我并不怪你不想吃，虽然我没什么可抱怨的，但是……我怀念新鲜捕获的鱼的味道。"

_Makes two of us, idiot._ "You stuffed your face with that burnt rice you like so much a day ago, never mind fresh catch," Asuka said. "I could go for a bit of that lime reduction of yours, with chicken and vegetables. How did you get butter that day?"  
我们俩都一样，笨蛋。"你昨天不是还大吃特吃你那烧焦的米饭吗，新鲜捕获的鱼就别提了，" 明日香说，"我倒是想来点你的青柠汁，配上鸡肉和蔬菜。那天你是怎么弄到黄油的？"

"Cost me a day and half of cleaning the trails around Viko's house," explained Shinji. "As you might expected, he refused to tell me where or how he got the butter in the first place."  
"花了我一天半的时间清理维科家周围的小径，" 真嗣解释道，"正如你可能预料到的，他一开始就拒绝告诉我他从哪里或怎么弄到黄油的。"

Asuka felt herself relax; the anxiousness of battle and the certainty of death relented to an extent. Hours before her first visit to the cell, a sliver of concern had gnawed at her awareness. What if that glass wall between them had reforged? _Nah. Speaking with him is easier than ever._  
明日香感到自己放松了下来；战斗的焦虑和死亡的确定性在一定程度上有所缓解。在她第一次探访牢房前的几个小时，一丝担忧啃噬着她的意识。如果他们之间的那堵玻璃墙重新建立起来怎么办？不，和他交谈比以往任何时候都容易。

"Those," she started once the final locks were cut. "Those bentos. Not just the ones from school an eternity ago. The meals you made in the village. They were all delicious."  
“那些，”她在一一剪断最后的锁链后开口道，“那些便当。不仅仅是学校时代久远的那份。你在村子里做的那些饭菜，都非常美味。”

"R-Really?" Shinji hid his face for a second, cheeks flushed, then mustered up the courage to look her in the eye. "I'm really glad to hear that," he said. "I'd like to cook more meals for you, when this is all over. If I ever got the chance, I wouldn't mind doing that from inside a prison cell, if that's what it took."  
“真、真的吗？”真嗣一时掩面，脸颊泛红，随后鼓起勇气直视她的眼睛，“听到你这么说，我真的很高兴，”他说，“等这一切结束后，我希望能为你做更多的饭菜。如果有机会，我不介意在监狱里做这些，只要能和你在一起。”

"Yeah, keep dreaming, idiot," Asuka replied with the shadow of a smile, forcing herself to sit next to Shinji. In a strange burst of emotion, she took a fierce hold of his hand, pretending to examine the old cut around his wrist. "Four-Eyes-eh… Mari put away some of those dumb flowers you got."  
"是啊，继续做梦吧，傻瓜。" 明日香带着一丝微笑的影子回答，强迫自己坐在真嗣旁边。在一种奇怪的情绪爆发中，她紧紧抓住他的手，假装检查他手腕上旧的割痕。"四眼仔……真希波把你那些傻花收起来了。"

"She did?" Shinji asked gently, smiling. "Remind me to thank her."  
"她真的收了？" 真嗣温柔地问道，微笑着。"提醒我谢谢她。"

"I'm not your mother. Remember it yourself," Asuka snapped with fake irritation. "I didn't mean to do that." Her thumb pressed on the scar. "Hated having to use that taser on you."  
"我不是你妈。记得自己记住，" 明日香假装生气地厉声说。"我不是故意那么说的。" 她的拇指按在疤痕上。"讨厌不得不对你用那电击枪。"

Shinji's free hand hesitantly made its way atop hers, and squeezed. "I know," he said. "Asuka, now that we have this chance, I wanted to tell you that I li-"  
真嗣的另一只手犹豫着放在了她的手上，轻轻握紧。“我知道，”他说，“明日香，既然现在有机会，我想告诉你，我喜——”

"I liked you back then, when we first met," Asuka interjected. Shinji's mouth snapped closed. _Thought I'd grown out of that. Who would've thought everyone in that boring village was right. These… inefficient emotions… keep coming back._ "But I grew up first," she carried on. "Look after my brat trees."  
“我那时也喜欢你，在我们初次相遇的时候，”明日香打断了他。真嗣的嘴突然闭上了。我以为我已经摆脱了那种感觉。谁会想到那个无聊村子里的人都说对了。这些……无效的情感……总是挥之不去。“但我先长大了，”她继续说道，“照顾好我的小树苗。”

The gate hissed open and closed before Shinji could react.  
门在他反应过来之前就嘶嘶地开了又关。

---

"Not fair." "不公平。"

Shinji sat on the cot, unmoving after minutes as Asuka's words continued to ring in his head. His fingers played with the blue roundel, entranced at how light reflected off its surface. After so many days, he still had no idea of what would earn him the red one.  
真嗣坐在床铺上，几分钟过去了依然一动不动，明日香的话还在他脑海中回响。他的手指摆弄着蓝色的圆徽，着迷于光线如何在表面反射。这么多天过去了，他仍然不知道怎样才能得到那枚红色的。

"You're supposed to name the trees yourself," he said. "Besides, what should I tell the penguin leader? He likes you more, the fish bite more often when you're around."  
"你应该自己给树命名，""他说，""再说了，我该跟企鹅头头说什么？他更喜欢你，你在这儿的时候鱼咬钩更频繁。"

_I'm not accepting this,_ Shinji thought with a bit of annoyance. _Not fair. Why do you get to say your piece, but I don't? This isn't a proper farewell. It's not… even a farewell at all._  
我不能接受这个，真嗣有些恼怒地想。这不公平。为什么你可以表达你的想法，而我却不行？这不是一个正式的告别。它甚至……根本不算告别。

Asuka had always expressed that the battle they were headed to was a lost cause. There was no returning to the village, not for her. Not if he simply stayed there, sitting on a cot doing nothing. His hand gripped the roundel with vehemence.  
明日香一直表明他们即将面对的战斗是一场必败的战役。她无法再回到村子了。如果他只是呆在那里，坐在床上无所事事，那是不可能的。他的手紧紧抓住圆盘，充满了决心。

"Resilience. The capacity to recover quickly from difficulties. Purpose." Shinji recited. "A world where she can glare at the food every day."  
“韧性。从困难中迅速恢复的能力。目的。”真嗣背诵道。“一个她每天都能对着食物瞪眼的世界。”

---

"Wish I could have seen you at least once more."  
"真希望还能再见你一面。"

Misato stared at the picture Asuka had give her before she left for the changing room. In it, she saw her son smiling brightly with Shinji by his side. Confidence akin to Kaji's brightened Junior's gaze, while maturity born out of struggle was clear in his posture. The last picture she had gotten of him was years earlier, when Ryoji was still a toddler. She secured the bloodstained band around her arm.  
美里凝视着明日香在她去更衣室前给她的那张照片。照片中，她看到自己的儿子与真嗣并肩而立，笑容灿烂。小次郎的眼神中闪烁着与加治相似的自信，而历经磨难后的成熟则清晰地体现在他的姿态上。她最后一次拥有他的照片是在几年前，那时亮司还是个幼儿。她将那条染血的头带紧紧缠绕在手臂上。

"If we lose, his home will be erased," she said. Her eyes turned to steel. "If we lose, my son dies. We're not going to lose."  
"如果我们失败了，他的家园将被抹去，""她说道，目光变得坚毅。""如果我们失败了，我的儿子将死去。我们绝不会输。"

"Whatever you say, Colonel," Ritsuko replied from the door. She produced the old bottle, filling two cups despite the heavy turbulence. "One last for the road?"  
"不管你说什么，上校，" 律子在门口回答。她拿出那瓶老酒，尽管颠簸剧烈，还是倒满了两杯。"最后一杯上路酒？"

"Hell yeah," Misato said, grinning. The old friends toasted drank the last remnants of sake left. "For a world where my son can grow up."  
"当然啦，" 美里笑着说。两位老朋友举杯饮尽剩下的最后一滴清酒。"为了一个能让我的儿子成长的世界。"

"For the rebirth of the tobacco industry."  
"为了烟草工业的重生。"

With every corner of the ship alive with activity and every crew member at battle stations, Misato found a mutiny unlikely, at least not if they managed to gain the upper hand. _Regardless, better safe than sorry. We can operate the ship with half the crew. It'll have to suffice, I don't want anyone soiling the walls of my ship with their blood._  
船上每个角落都充满了活力，每个船员都处于战斗岗位，Misato 认为发生叛变的可能性不大，至少在他们占据上风之前不会。尽管如此，安全总比后悔好。我们可以用一半的船员来操作这艘船。这已经足够了，我不希望任何人的血玷污我的船壁。

With precious minutes remaining, Misato sent a minuscule cup of wine to every sailor.  
在宝贵的几分钟内，Misato 给每个水手送了一小杯葡萄酒。

"Ready to storm NERV headquarters at any time," said Ritsuko.  
“随时准备突袭 NERV 总部，”Ritsuko 说道。

"Non-combat personal on standby!"  
"非战斗人员待命！"

"Battle stations ready!" "战斗岗位准备就绪！"

"Captain to crew." Misato's voice reverberated through the ship. Crew members of all factions nodded, raising their cups. "I thank you all for coming here, knowing you could have stayed behind with your families. Now, let's make sure they stay safe and protected! This is for them!"  
"全体船员注意。" 美里的话语在船内回荡。各派船员纷纷点头，举起手中的杯子。"感谢各位明知可以与家人团聚却仍来到这里。现在，让我们确保他们的安全与保护！这一切都是为了他们！"

"For them!" "为了他们！"

"In order to irreversibly prevent the Fourth Impact from happening," she continued. "This ship will now assault NERV HQ at the former South Pole Ground Zero. Operation Yamato will neutralize Unit 13, the trigger of the rites. We'll bring an end to this chaos, once and for all. Launch Wunder!"  
"为了彻底阻止第四次冲击的发生，"" 她继续说道。""这艘船现在将攻击位于南极旧地的 NERV 总部。大和行动将中立化仪式的触发器——13 号机。我们将一劳永逸地结束这场混乱。启动奇迹号！"

"Entry sequence completed," Ritsuko announced to her left. "Command control transferred to battle bridge."  
"进入程序完成，"" 律子向左宣布。""指挥控制权已转移至战斗桥。"

"We've reached the seed storage unit ejection points!" Yelled one of the bridge bunnies.  
"我们已经到达种子储存单元弹射点！" 舰桥上的一个操作员喊道。

"Roger." Misato's hands clenched. _Kaji, Viko. Thank you._ "Sever linkage with the Wunder. Switch to internal power and control systems. Eject all seed storage units."  
"收到。" 美里紧握双手。加治，维克。谢谢你们。 "切断与奇迹号的联系。切换至内部电源和控制系统。弹射所有种子储存单元。"

The seed reserves within the ship were expelled and placed in orbit, away from the battle and from Ikari's hands. Kaji's legacy, which Viko had protected and nurtured for years, was finally safe.  
船内的种子储备被弹射出去，置于远离战场和碇源堂掌控的轨道上。加治的遗产，多年来由维克保护和培育，终于安全了。

"Autonomous systems functioning nominally," Hyuuga informed. "All units have been ejected."  
“自主系统运行正常，”日向报告道，“所有单位已弹射完毕。”

_After all these years, you're still helping me out, dummy,_ Misato thought. Her eyes narrowed behind the glasses. "Start descent to target. Initiate re-entry!"  
这么多年过去了，你还是在帮我，傻瓜，美里心想。她透过眼镜眯起了眼睛。“开始下降至目标位置。启动再入程序！”

The ship's massive AT-Field clashed against Ground Zero's barrier, gaining access to hallowed ground with little difficulty. They maneuvered atop the L-barrier, crashing the alabaster surface like it was ice as they moved forward.  
飞船巨大的 AT 力场与地面零点的屏障相撞，毫不费力地突破了神圣领域。他们在 L 屏障上空操纵，如同破冰般在洁白的表面上前进。

"We're above the L-C field that reject all life stained by the original sin," Kitakami muttered.  
"我们正穿越 L-C 场，它排斥一切沾染原罪的生命，"北上喃喃自语。

Takao nodded from his station. "Humanity is advancing through this purified area without being blessed. All thanks to Kaji's data and the Anti-L system. All systems optimal to dive."  
高雄从他的岗位点头。"人类正通过这片被净化过的区域，未受祝福地前行。这一切都归功于加持的数据和反 L 系统。所有系统均已优化，准备潜入。"

_We're close._ "Roger," Misato said. "All stations, ready for dive."  
我们快到了。"收到，"美里说。"各岗位，准备潜入。"

A massive explosion scorched through the Wunder's right wing. "Starboard hull no.2 hit! Damage unknown!" Shigeru yelled.  
一次巨大的爆炸贯穿了 Wunder 的右翼。“右舷二号受损！损伤情况不明！”斯吉鲁大喊。

"Enemy ship sighted at 3 o'clock!"  
“三点钟方向发现敌舰！”

"The Erlosung," Ritsuko bit through gritted teeth. A dark vessel comparable in size to their own sprung out of the barrier. "The bastards completed it."  
“是 Erlosung，”律子咬牙切齿地说。一艘与他们自身大小相当的黑色舰船从屏障中跃出。“那些混蛋完成了它。”

"Trying to buy time for Unit 13's activation, huh," Aoba growled.  
"试图为 13 号机激活争取时间，是吧，"青叶咆哮道。

"Same God-slaying power as us," Ritsuko added. "Tricky."  
"和我们一样的弑神之力，"律子补充道。"棘手。

"Bring it on!" Misato exclaimed. "We'll hold that NERV ship at bay as we hurry to the diving point. Fire!"  
"来吧！"美里高呼。"我们会拖住 NERV 的船，同时赶往潜水点。开火！

Exchanging fire with the ship proved fruitless; the Erlosung's attacks were too powerful, yet the AT-Field generators managed to suppress enough of it for the Wunder to reach the diving point.  
与那艘船交火毫无成效；Erlosung 的攻击过于强大，但 AT 力场发生器成功压制了足够多的火力，让 Wunder 得以抵达下潜点。

"We're taking way too much damage! How is this ship comparable to ours?"  
“我们受损太严重了！这艘船怎么能和我们相比？”

"If it's raw firepower, they might have the advantage," Takao grumbled. "But in propulsion and speed… we win! Diving point up ahead!"  
“论火力，他们可能占优，”高雄抱怨道，“但在推进力和速度上……我们更胜一筹！前方就是下潜点！”

"Emergency dive!" Misato screamed.  
"紧急下潜！" 美里尖叫道。

Immersed in a sea of blood and core energy, the Wunder stayed true to course. "Eva infinity swarm dead ahead!" said Midori.  
沉浸在血海与核心能量之中，Wunder 号坚守航向。"前方发现 Eva 无限集群，已确认死亡！" 美鸟报告道。

"Doesn't matter, we'll blitz through them!" Misato replied.  
"无所谓，我们会一举突破！" 美里回应道。

"Enemy ship sighted at 12 o'clock!"  
"敌舰在 12 点钟方向被发现！"

"Ship no.3, the Erbsunde," Ritsuko said, glowering at the screen. "We're caught in a pincer attack!"  
"三号舰，‘艾尔布森德’号，" 律子说着，目光阴沉地盯着屏幕。"我们陷入夹击了！"

"This is bad!" Shigeru shouted. "If we receive more damage, the navigation will fail!"  
"情况不妙！" 四郎大喊。"如果再受创，导航系统就要失灵了！"

Explosions came from both sides, crashing many of the ship's automated systems and piercing the AT-Fields. The PDA in Misato's jacket pocket vibrated, indicating someone was hacking the code to enter Shinji's cell. _God damn it,_ she thought. _Stay safe, Shin-chan._  
爆炸声从两侧传来，摧毁了船上的许多自动化系统，并穿透了 AT 力场。Misato 夹克口袋里的 PDA 震动起来，显示有人正在破解代码进入 Shinji 的牢房。该死，她心想。要安全，Shin-chan。

"Ship no.3 has poor outfitting. We'll sink it first," Misato replied. "Maximum battle speed, stay true to course! We'll ram into her!"  
“3 号船装备不良。我们先击沉它，”Misato 回答道。“全速战斗，保持航向！我们要撞上去！”

"Roger!" “收到！”

The Wunder clashed directly against the enemy ship, turning on its axis to revert their positions and use the enemy vessel as a shield.  
温德号直接撞击敌舰，旋转其轴心以逆转位置，并利用敌舰作为盾牌。

"We've broken through the Infinity swarm," Ritsuko informed. Her eyes narrowed at the data on her screen. "NERV HQ has already sunk beyond the Black Moon."  
“我们已经突破了无限集群，”律子报告道。她的目光紧盯着屏幕上的数据，“NERV 总部已经沉没于黑月之下。”

"Unit 13's activation is imminent," said Takao.  
“十三号机的启动迫在眉睫，”高雄说道。

"We're out of time!" Misato concluded, glaring straight ahead. "We'll use the moon as a cover and set our course for assault. Ready the guided ammunition! Set the target to Unit 13's readjustment sector!"  
"我们时间不多了！" 美里断言，目光直视前方。"利用月球作为掩护，设定突击航线。准备制导弹药！将目标设定为第 13 号机调整区域！"

A third NERV ship attacked from behind, forcing the crew to focus the AT-Field around the Wunder's wings. Heavy damage was reported in the main engines, but Misato flew straight ahead until they were close enough to release the warships loaded with explosives. The surface of NERV's pyramid was engulfed in flames, revealing the dormant Evangelion beneath the smoke and ash.  
第三艘 NERV 舰从后方发起攻击，迫使船员集中 AT 力场保护 Wunder 的机翼。主引擎报告严重受损，但美里直冲向前，直到足够接近释放装载爆炸物的战舰。NERV 金字塔的表面被火焰吞没，烟雾和灰烬下显露出沉睡的 EVA。

"As expected, it hasn't reactivated," Ritsuko said. "Unit 13 is still immobile."  
"正如预期，它尚未重新激活，" 律子说道。"第 13 号机依然无法动弹。"

"Eva Series 7 inbound!" informed Midori. "A swarm of them! It's impossible to count!"  
"Eva 系列 7 号接近中！" 美登里报告道，"一大群！数不清的数量！"

"Ignore the small fries!" Misato ordered in return. "Prepare the Evas for launch!"  
"别管那些小角色！" 美里命令道，"准备启动 Eva！"

---

"Come on, hurry up! We've only got this one chance!"  
"快点，快点！我们只有这一次机会！"

The pilot and seven other crew members made their way to the cages. Constant explosions and heavy turbulence slowed their progress, forced them to stumble into each other, and had cost the biggest of them his sidearm. They moved ahead regardless, knowing there no longer was a chance to rethink their actions.  
飞行员和其他七名机组人员向笼子走去。持续的爆炸和剧烈的颠簸减缓了他们的步伐，迫使他们相互碰撞，其中最魁梧的一位甚至丢失了他的配枪。尽管如此，他们仍继续前进，知道已无回头之路。

"Keep blocking command's signal!" demanded the deckhand. "I've got a hold on the brat's cage. Decoding the entrance sequence right now!"  
“继续屏蔽指挥信号！”甲板员命令道，“我正在控制那孩子的笼子。正在解码入口序列！”

"Suzuhara better have done her part," the big sailor grunted. "God damn it, my handgun's floating somewhere in the lower levels."  
“铃原最好已经完成了她的任务，”大个子水手咕哝着，“该死，我的手枪不知漂到下层哪个角落了。”

"We don't need you shooting the brat out of spite," the pilot said. "We've got access to Unit 01's hangar, and the Entry Plug. All we need now is for our DSS trigger to work, and the Third. If there's no victory for us, neither will there be one for Ikari. We'll take from him what he wants most, he can have Fourth Impact if he so wishes, but he won't get Unit 01."  
"我们不需要你出于怨恨射杀那小子，"飞行员说。"我们已经能进入 01 机库和插入栓。现在只差 DSS 触发器生效，还有第三使徒。如果我们赢不了，碇也别想赢。我们要夺走他最想要的东西，他想要第四次冲击就随他去吧，但他休想得到 01。"

"Let him be king over bone and rotten meat," muttered the youngest deckhand. "Let him be king of the ashes."  
"让他成为骸骨与腐肉之王，"最年轻的船员低声说。"让他成为灰烬之王。"

Another array of explosions sent them flying. The pilot's head slammed against the wall, opening a wide gash on his forehead, whereas one of the deckhand's arms was broken after it impacted a rail. There was no time to waste on injuries, so five of the seven hurried ahead. _Come on, just a little more,_ he thought in desperation as blood colored half his sight crimson. _Three, two one! Done!_  
又一阵爆炸将他们掀飞。飞行员的头猛撞在墙上，额头上裂开一道大口子，而一名船员的手臂在撞击栏杆后骨折。没有时间耽搁在伤痛上，于是七人中的五个急忙向前冲去。快点，再快一点，他绝望地想着，鲜血染红了半边视野。三、二、一！成了！

"I have access!" he screamed. "Get the Third and move to the hangar! The gate is unlocked!"  
“我有权限！”他尖叫道，“去叫第三队，然后去机库！大门已经解锁了！”

The group ran into the holding area, guns drawn, but lowered them a second afterwards. Confusion and despair set on their features.  
这群人冲进羁押区，枪已上膛，但随即又放低了枪口。困惑与绝望在他们脸上交织。

"What are you doing, standing there? Move, damn you! Get the damn bra…t."  
“你们站在那儿干嘛？动起来，该死的！快去拿那个该死的……胸甲。”

Empty. The cell door was wide open, but Shinji Ikari was gone.  
空荡荡的。牢房门大开着，但碇真嗣却不见了。

---

Kozo Fuyutsuki sighed. 葛城美里叹了口气。

The vessels were reaching the preordained positions, and the Wunder was about to release their Evangelions into battle. Realizing every last detail had indeed gone according to Ikari's machinations, the old professor felt a sharp, scalding needle press against his chest.  
舰船已抵达预定位置，而 Wunder 号即将释放他们的 EVA 投入战斗。意识到每一个细节都确实按照碇真嗣的谋划进行，这位老教授感到一阵尖锐而灼热的刺痛压在胸口。

"Sorry about all this," he whispered. His heart was soon to give out. The automated medical facility had given him a week, two at best. "We'll have to entertain Gendo's game a little longer."  
“抱歉这一切，”他低声说道。他的心脏很快就要停止跳动。自动医疗设施给了他一周时间，最多两周。“我们还得陪着源堂的游戏再玩一会儿。”

_You wish to take from Shinji that which was taken from you,_ he thought in despair. _How can you not see that propagating that cycle of pain will bring you nothing in the end? Foolish student._  
你想从真嗣那里夺走你曾失去的东西，他绝望地想。你怎么看不到延续这种痛苦循环最终只会让你一无所得？愚蠢的学生。

In order to bring about his Impact, Gendo required the power of one more angel, and currently only one more remained. The trap had been set from the very first spike of activity within their old pyramid, and was working depressingly well, which cemented the Second Child's sad fate.  
为了引发他的冲击，源堂需要再多一个使徒的力量，而目前只剩下一个使徒。从他们古老金字塔内的第一次活动尖峰开始，陷阱就已经布下，并且运作得令人沮丧地好，这决定了第二适格者的悲惨命运。

"I must admit, you caught me off guard, Katsuragi," he said. The fourth ship activated, waiting in the shadows for the right moment to enact their checkmate. "Using one of our vessels as a shield, warships as ammunition, heh. How reckless."  
"我必须承认，你让我措手不及了，Katsuragi，"他说道。第四艘舰船启动了，潜伏在暗影中等待着最佳时机来实施将军。"利用我们的舰船作为盾牌，战舰作为弹药，呵，多么鲁莽。"

Little remained, if anything at all. Everyone he had known and loved had been reduced to core energy, LCL, or consumed by ambition and grief. Little, but a flicker of hope and righteousness that danced in Shinji's eyes. He had seen it, ever so briefly, in the retrieved footage from the Wunder's departure.  
几乎什么都没剩下，如果有的话。他所认识和爱过的每个人都化为了核心能量，LCL，或是被野心和悲伤吞噬。但有一丝希望和正义在真嗣的眼中跳动。他曾在从 Wunder 出发的回收录像中，短暂地看到过这一幕。

Yui's legacy still survived.  
Yui 的遗产依然存续着。

"You may realize very soon," Kozo said. "That the thing you sought after for so long was right next to you. Fear made you weak, not strong as you had hoped. Grief has blinded you, as it blinded me. Ah, but this storm too, shall pass. I pray you find your happiness, foolish student."  
"你或许很快就会明白，" 高藏说道，"你长久追寻的东西其实一直近在咫尺。恐惧让你变得软弱，而非如你所愿的坚强。悲伤蒙蔽了你的双眼，正如它曾蒙蔽我一样。啊，但这场风暴终将过去。我祈祷你能找到你的幸福，愚蠢的学生。"

He turned to the screen and smiled. Unit 08 was inbound. "Isn't that right, Miss Iscariot?"  
他转向屏幕，微笑着。08 号单位正在接近。"没错吧，伊斯卡里奥特小姐？"

_One last time.  最后一次。_

Asuka's eye narrowed at the mass of Evangelions flying towards the Wunder. Too many to count, indeed, but not nearly enough to keep her from ending it all. Her Unit 02 was as operational as it was ever likely to get, the borrowed time she had been living in had come to a close.  
看着成群的 EVA 向 Wunder 飞来，明日香眯起了眼睛。数量多到数不清，但还不足以阻止她终结一切。她的二号机状态已经调整到可能的最佳状态，她所借来的时间已经走到了尽头。

The timer was close to reaching zero.  
计时器即将归零。

"_Mari, Asuka,"_ Misato's voice rang from the comm. _"I'm counting on you."_  
“真希波，明日香，”美里从通讯器中传来声音，“我指望你们了。”

"Makes two of you, then," Asuka muttered. The enemy circled around her. "Get out of my way!"  
“那我们俩一样了，”明日香嘀咕道。敌人绕着她转圈。“别挡我的路！”

Unit 02 fired the first missile charge, extinguishing the first wave of Evas in a flash of blue and red. With the reinforced bullets at hand, Asuka fired in a spiraling motion, detonating every core in sight with a perfectly placed shot on each attacker.  
二号机率先发射了第一波导弹，蓝红光芒一闪，瞬间消灭了第一批 EVA。手持强化子弹的明日香以螺旋状射击，每一发都精准命中来袭者的核心，完美引爆。

"_Sorry, coming through!"_ Mari exclaimed merrily while bashing Evas left and right.  
“抱歉，借过一下！”真希波欢快地喊着，左右开弓击退 EVA。

_No time to waste on you lot. Your freaking antics are putting my brat trees in danger!_ The bullets ran out. The storm was most likely slamming against the village, rooting out the seedlings and Rei's harvest. _I said out of my way!_  
没时间跟你们这帮家伙浪费。你们那些疯狂的举动正危及我的小树苗！子弹用完了。风暴很可能正在猛击村庄，摧毁幼苗和丽的收成。我说了，让开！

"Four-Eyes, out of ammo!" Asuka urged, using the empty weapon to bash in the Eva's skulls. "Next weapon!"  
“四眼仔，没子弹了！”明日香催促道，用空枪砸碎了使徒的头骨。“换武器！”

"_Okey dokey! Catch, Princess!"_  
“好嘞！接住，公主！”

A blade landed in Unit 02's hand. Asuka cut away her enemies with unbridled brutality, impaling four Evas and pushing them away. "Tsk, next one!" she yelled. "Damn it!"  
一把利刃落入二号机的手中。明日香以无与伦比的残忍斩杀敌人，刺穿四台 EVA 并将它们推开。“啧，下一个！”她大喊。“该死！”

Several skeletal figures attached themselves to her. They bit, scratched and ravaged through the armor, one of the tried to snip at her face and gouge out Unit 02's eyes. Before it could sink its teeth in, however, a sawed axe landed in its skull.  
几具骷髅般的身影附着在她身上。它们撕咬、抓挠，穿透装甲，其中一个试图咬向她的脸并挖出二号机的眼睛。然而，在它咬下之前，一把锯齿斧头劈入了它的头骨。

"_Princess!"_  “公主！”

"About damn time!" Asuka hoisted one axe in each hand and cut every Eva that approached into pieces. A mass of Unit 07 series gathered, forming a monstrous drill meant to pierce through the Wunder. "They're grouping up to block the way. How annoying!" Another round of missiles did nothing to stop the enemy. "Four-Eyes, give me a hand!"  
“终于来了！”明日香双手各持一柄战斧，将逼近的每一台 Eva 斩成碎片。一大群第七系列机体聚集起来，形成一个巨大的钻头，意图穿透 Wunder。“它们集结起来阻挡去路，真烦人！”又一轮导弹攻击未能阻止敌人。“四眼仔，帮我一把！”

"_Gotcha!"_  “收到！”

Unit 08 flew next to her, and both extended their hands, shaping their AT-Fields into a drill of their own. One after the other, the copies were eradicated until the massive cloud broke. Asuka slowed their descent into the pyramid with Unit 02's boosters, and at last they landed a few hundred feet from their target.  
第八号机飞至她身旁，两者同时伸出双手，将 AT 力场塑造成自己的钻头。一台接一台，复制体被消灭，直到庞大的敌群被击溃。明日香利用二号机的推进器减缓下降速度，最终他们在距离目标几百英尺处着陆。

_It's close, so close. I can end this buffoonery once and for all._ "Our target's below that crater!" Asuka exclaimed. Something landed on her face, blocking her vision. "Get off me!"  
就差一点，近在咫尺。我终于可以结束这场闹剧了。“目标就在那个弹坑下面！”明日香喊道。有什么东西落在了她的脸上，挡住了视线。“从我身上滚开！”

Unit 02 rolled on the ground and broke free. The screen to Asuka's right depicted the new attackers; sentient limbs of Adam copies armed with knives. She punched and kicked her way into the crater, advancing little under the constant onslaught.  
二号机在地上翻滚着挣脱束缚。明日香右侧的屏幕显示了新的攻击者；亚当复制体的智能肢体，手持利刃。她在持续的猛攻下，边打边踢地冲进了弹坑，进展甚微。

"These gnats are too much of a pain!"  
“这些小虫子真烦人！”

The coming attacks were negated by Unit 08's whip, clearing a path. _"Go ahead, Princess!"_ Mari said through the comm. _"I'll hold them off! Be careful!"_  
即将到来的攻击被 08 号机用鞭子化解，开辟出一条道路。“快走，公主！”玛丽通过通讯器喊道，“我来挡住他们！小心！”

"Thanks, Four-Eyes!" “谢谢，四眼仔！”

Her muscles were burning. Whatever parts of Unit 02 remained screamed in constant agony, whereas the rest of her body felt heavy, sluggish. Asuka disregarded the pain in her eye and activated the propulsor's self destruct sequence, using the explosion to propel the Eva forward.  
她的肌肉在燃烧。02 号机残存的部分不断发出痛苦的哀嚎，而她身体的其他部分则感到沉重、迟缓。明日香无视眼中的疼痛，启动了推进器的自毁程序，利用爆炸将 Eva 向前推进。

_The stupid penguins will be the first to be taken out by the blast. The water will boil. The shelter won't hold. That stupid little spot where the Idiot Tree is will burn. Nobody will be left to gather the stupid harvest, there will be no village. Forward. Forward, Asuka! Forward!  
那些愚蠢的企鹅将会首先被爆炸吞噬。水会沸腾。避难所将无法支撑。那个愚蠢的小地方，也就是白痴树所在之处，将会燃烧。没有人会留下来收割那愚蠢的庄稼，村庄将不复存在。前进。前进，明日香！前进！_

LCL softened the landing to the chamber. Asuka's glare fixed on her target, which still lay strapped to a massive cross. "Eva Unit 13," she panted, hand reaching for the L-C spear. "We made it." The angel within her eye withered, as though terrified.  
LCL 缓冲了落入舱室的冲击。明日香的目光紧锁目标，那目标仍被牢牢固定在一个巨大的十字架上。“EVA 十三号机，”她喘息着，手伸向 L-C 长矛。“我们做到了。”她眼中的天使似乎因恐惧而萎靡。

"They may call it 'God's Eva', but it's just the 13th man-made… multipurpose… humanoid decisive weapon." Unit 02 climbed atop the violet behemoth. "If I shoot this shutdown override signal plug into the core, even if we can't destroy it, it won't be able to move."  
“他们或许称之为‘神的 EVA’，但它不过是第十三个人造……多功能……人形决战兵器。”二号机攀上了那紫色的巨兽。“如果我将这个关机覆盖信号插头插入核心，即便我们无法摧毁它，它也无法动弹。”

_Ken-ken and all those burly idiots will be safe. The stupid rice will yield. Fish will flourish and keep those creepy birds fat. The idiot can go back to that dumb little cooking station, do his rounds in the ration center. Build, walk, grow. I can finally fulfill the purpose I was put on this earth for. I can finally… hope to go back to that boring forest!  
健健和那些壮硕的傻瓜们都会安然无恙。愚蠢的稻米将会屈服。鱼儿会繁盛，让那些讨厌的鸟儿保持肥硕。那个傻瓜可以回到他那简陋的小厨房，在配给中心巡视。建造，行走，成长。我终于能实现被赋予地球上的使命。我终于……希望能回到那片无聊的森林！_

"Step by step," she muttered. "Little by little, you find yourself doing impossible things. And this…" Asuka raised the weapon and took aim. "This is the end!"  
“一步一步，”她喃喃自语。“一点一滴，你会发现自己在做不可能的事。而这次……”明日香举起武器，瞄准目标。“这就是结局！”

The spike clashed against a barrier, pushing Asuka back. "An AT-Field?" She exclaimed, incredulous. "Unit 13's not supposed to have one… wait. Is this Unit 02's own AT-Field? It's afraid of Unit 13?" Regardless of how much she tried, the filed would not relent. "Come on, they need this thing to complete the final impact… I have to get rid of it right now! It's right in front of me, and I _can't_ get through!"  
长矛撞击在屏障上，将明日香推了回去。“AT 力场？”她惊呼，难以置信。“13 号机不应该有……等等。这是 2 号机自己的 AT 力场？它害怕 13 号机？”无论她怎么尝试，力场都不肯退让。“拜托，他们需要这个来完成最终冲击……我现在就得把它解决掉！它就在我面前，我却无法突破！”

_Something boring. The idiot's song, his half-assed compliments of my tasteless food,_ she thought. Resignation consumed most of the hope that had blossomed in the village. _If I don't see this through, there won't any place where he can sit around and look pathetic!_  
某件无聊的事。那个白痴的歌，他对我的无味食物半吊子的赞美，她想。放弃吞噬了村庄中大部分萌生的希望。如果我不坚持下去，他将无处可坐，只能显得可怜兮兮！

"Time for a last resort," she growled, closing her eye in anguish. "Sorry, Unit 02, I have to make you go all out. Disable all restrictions! Code Triple nine!"  
“是时候用绝招了，”她咆哮着，痛苦地闭上眼睛。“对不起，二号机，我必须让你全力以赴。解除所有限制！代码三九九！”

Darkness shrouded the Entry Plug in a heartbeat. Mari's Eva had sustained heavy damage outside; no back-up was available. _Sorry, idiot. I never told you, did I? You earned the roundel a while ago, when I gave you that hat you liked so much._ Her body convulsed, and pain unlike any other radiated from her eye. Asuka removed the patch, and opened her contaminated eye. _Go and look after my trees. Lunch will have to wait for another lifetime._  
黑暗在一瞬间笼罩了插入栓。真希的 Eva 在外部遭受了重创；没有后备支援。对不起，白痴。我从未告诉过你，对吧？你早该得到那个徽章了，就在我给你那顶你喜欢的帽子时。她的身体抽搐着，从未有过的疼痛从她的眼睛辐射开来。明日香摘下眼罩，睁开了她受污染的眼睛。去照顾我的树吧。午餐只能等到下辈子了。

She screamed as the restraint lodged within her eye was expelled. Every cell in her body screamed alongside her. _Stupid song, think of the stupid song, god damn you!_ She grabbed onto the cylinder with both hands and ripped it off. Blood sprinkled the controls and plugsuit, and the DSS choker around her neck activated.  
当嵌入她眼中的束缚被排出时，她尖叫起来。体内的每一个细胞都与她一同尖叫。愚蠢的歌，想想那愚蠢的歌，该死的！她双手抓住圆筒，猛地扯下。血液溅洒在控制器和紧身衣上，而她脖子上的 DSS 项圈随即启动。

Bardiel had awoken. 巴迪尔已经苏醒。

_Something feels off.  感觉有些不对劲。_

"The ships are descending, they stopped the assault," Ritsuko said from behind her. "Something's not right."  
“舰队正在降落，他们停止了攻击，”律子从她身后说道，“情况不对劲。”

Crumbling remnants of the Black Moon floated all around them, with bloodied pools flowing through its surface like veins. The enemy ships descended lower than the pyramid, and began to exude a blinding resplendence. Dread ever so slowly crawled up the Captain's spine, chilling her chest and spreading to her limbs.  
四周漂浮着黑月支离破碎的残骸，血迹斑斑的池水在其表面流淌，宛如血管。敌舰降得比金字塔还要低，开始散发出耀眼的光辉。恐惧缓缓爬上舰长的脊背，冰冷了她的胸膛，蔓延至四肢。

"Wings of light?" Misato's voice strained. "They want to cause Fourth Impact using the same method as the Second?"  
“光之翼？”美里声音紧绷，“他们想用与第二次冲击相同的方法引发第四次冲击？”

"No," answered Ritsuko. "They can't use those ships as a trigger. Besides, what's happening to the Black Moon isn't part of the plan. This… isn't SEELE's scenario. It's a rite we know nothing about."  
"不，" 律子回答，"他们不能用那些船作为触发器。而且，黑月发生的事情并不在计划之内。这……不是 SEELE 的剧本。这是一个我们一无所知的仪式。

The Black Moon condensed into a single beam of light and shadow. The key to Ikari's impact was at hand. "An unpredicted Impact, then," Misato growled. "This changes nothing. We'll crush all of NERV's plans. Ready the main guns! We'll take out ship no.3 first!"  
黑月凝聚成一束光与影。引发碇的冲击的关键近在咫尺。"那么，这是一个未预料到的冲击，"美里咆哮道，"这改变不了什么。我们将粉碎 NERV 的所有计划。准备主炮！我们先摧毁三号舰！

"The fourth ship… why have they not used it?" Ritsuko asked. "There was supposed to be a fourth."  
"第四艘船……他们为什么还没使用？" 律子问道，"应该有第四艘的。

"Doesn't matter, fire!" Misato screamed.  
"没关系，开火！" 美里尖叫道。

Metal wailed and bent before the bombardment could begin. The Wunder shook under the heavy assault; its keel was pierced by two massive spikes as a new enemy vessel rushed from beneath the L-C barrier.  
金属在轰炸开始前就已哀鸣扭曲。Wunder 号在猛烈攻击下摇晃；它的龙骨被两根巨大的尖刺贯穿，一艘新的敌舰从 L-C 屏障下疾驰而出。

"Direct hit!" Shigeru reported through the chaos. "Something pierced our starboard and secondary hulls!"  
"直接命中！" 在混乱中，四郎报告道，"有什么东西穿透了我们的右舷和辅助船体！"

"Heavy damage sustained!" added Aoba. "Main gun systems are down!"  
“遭受重创！”青叶补充道，“主炮系统已瘫痪！”

"Gebet, the fourth ship." Ritsuko's hands clenched into fists alongside Misato's. "We fell right into their trap."  
“格贝特，第四舰。”律子的手紧握成拳，与美里的一同。“我们正中他们下怀。”

The DSS trigger buzzed from within her pocket. Misato felt her breathing constrict long before Shigeru's screen changed color.  
DSS 触发器在她口袋中嗡嗡作响。在四郎的屏幕变色之前，美里就感到呼吸紧促。

"Pattern blue!" He exclaimed. "I have readings of the 9th Angel from within NERV HQ!"  
“蓝色模式！”他惊呼道，“我在 NERV 总部内检测到了第九使徒的信号！”

"Unauthorized entry to the containment hangar!" Takao screamed next, giving Misato no time to digest the information. "Someone's trying to access Unit 01's cage and deploy system! The Third Child is not in his cell! We have no visual!"  
“未经授权进入封存机库！”高雄紧接着尖叫起来，让美里没有时间消化这些信息。“有人试图接近零壹机的牢笼并启动系统！第三适格者不在他的牢房里！我们失去了监控画面！”

"Damn it." Misato's eyes shifted to the gate. _They chose this of all moments to make their move? Fine._ "Take command for a moment, Rits," she said. "Prioritize minimizing casualties! If we surrender Unit 01, we give NERV the last tool they require to initiate Fourth Impact! Seal the hangar doors!"  
“该死。”美里的目光转向大门。他们偏偏选在这个时候行动？好吧。“暂时接管指挥，律子，”她说道，“优先减少伤亡！如果我们交出零壹机，就等于给了 NERV 启动第四次冲击所需的最后工具！封锁机库大门！”

"Roger!" "罗杰！"

_Damn it, not now,_ Misato thought as she hurried to the elevator connecting to Unit 01's containment area. After a second's hesitation, she grabbed the plugsuit Ritsuko has given her the day before. _Hang on, Asuka. Back-up is coming._  
该死，不是现在，美里一边想着，一边匆忙赶往连接零号机收容区的电梯。犹豫了一秒后，她抓起了昨天律子给她的插头服。坚持住，明日香。支援来了。

"How are you here? _Why_ are you here?"  
"你怎么会在这里？你为什么在这里？"

Shinji's inquiries went unanswered as he followed the blond through a maze of hallways. Every few seconds they'd have to brace as the ship trembled, and once already had he almost been blown away. Smoke riddled the air, non-combat personal cowered in their stations, and a vile sense of loss spread over his chest.  
真嗣的询问无人应答，他跟着金发男子穿过迷宫般的走廊。每隔几秒，他们就得紧贴墙壁，因为船身不断颤抖，有一次他差点被甩飞出去。空气中弥漫着烟雾，非战斗人员蜷缩在自己的岗位上，一种恶毒的失落感在他胸中蔓延。

"Viko? Where are goin-" “维克？我们要去哪儿——”

The man took hold of him and forced them both into a corner, covering Shinji's mouth with his hand. Debris and fire came flying through the hallway a second afterwards, followed by hurried screams.  
那人抓住他，将两人一起拽进一个角落，用手捂住真嗣的嘴。紧接着，碎片和火焰从走廊中飞过，随后是急促的尖叫声。

"Seems like the attack on the ship froze the coup," Viko muttered. "Not the best idea to usurp command in the middle of a losing battle, after all. You okay there, Shinji?"  
"看来对飞船的攻击冻结了这场政变，" Viko 低声说道。"毕竟，在一场败局已定的战斗中夺取指挥权可不是什么好主意。你还好吗，真嗣？"

"I'm fine," Shinji replied after being released. "Thanks. Can you at least tell me where we're going?"  
"我没事，" 真嗣在被放开后回答。"谢谢。你至少能告诉我我们要去哪儿吗？"

Viko's gaze turned stoic, unwavering. "You know where we're going," he grated. "Asuka's in trouble. Come on, there's no time."  
Viko 的目光变得坚定，毫不动摇。"你知道我们要去哪儿，" 他咬牙说道。"明日香有麻烦了。快点，没时间了。"

_Asuka?  明日香？_

Nodding, Shinji's eyes also lost whatever hesitation still lingered. He followed Viko in silence, heart thundering in his head, drowning out the noise of commands, explosions and terror. _Asuka's in trouble. Hurry. Move, move, move._  
点头间，真嗣眼中的犹疑也消散无踪。他默默跟随维科，心跳如雷鸣般在脑海中回响，淹没了命令声、爆炸声和恐惧声。明日香有危险。快点。动起来，动起来，动起来。

Both began to jog and then run once the major turbulence halted. Viko seemed to know the ship well; he maneuvered them out of sight every time they were about to meet a group carrying a wounded sailor, or the crews trying to extinguish the fires. No trace remained of the eccentric botany enthusiast. The man's eyes reminded Shinji of his father in some way, or even Misato.  
两人在主要动荡平息后开始慢跑，随后加速奔跑。维科似乎对这艘船非常熟悉；每当他们即将遇到一群抬着受伤水手的队伍，或是试图扑灭火焰的船员时，他总能巧妙地引导他们避开视线。那个古怪的植物学爱好者已不见踪影。那人的眼神让真嗣想起了他的父亲，甚至是美里。

"Unit 01's up ahead," said Viko once they reached a massive gate. "Only the Captain has the code. If the mutineers do their job right, though, we might just be able to sneak in."  
“前方就是 01 号单位，”维科在他们到达一座巨大的门前说道，“只有队长知道密码。但如果叛变者们做得好，我们或许能悄悄潜入。”

_They want me to activate the self-destruct system,_ Shinji recalled. The hairs on his nape began to stand. Someone was watching them. _It that helps Asuka, that's what I'll do. But first, I'll make sure she's safe. I'm not going to lose her like I lost Ayanami or Rei._  
他们想让我启动自毁系统，真嗣回忆道。他后颈的毛发开始竖起。有人在监视他们。如果这能帮助明日香，我就会去做。但首先，我要确保她是安全的。我不会像失去绫波或零那样失去她。

Shinji's hand gripped the roundel in his pocket. "Is there any way to reach Misato?" he asked. "if Asuka needs help, I'm sure she'd let me pilot-"  
真嗣的手紧握着口袋里的圆形徽章。“有什么办法联系到美里吗？”他问道，“如果明日香需要帮助，我相信她会让我驾驶的——”

"Stop right there!" the tall sailor who had punched him came running at them with a wrench in his hand. "I found him, guys! Do you copy? There's reaching the hangar, get over here quick!"  
"站住！"那个高个子水手，就是之前揍了他的那个，手里拿着扳手朝他们冲过来。"我找到他了，伙计们！收到吗？他正往机库去，快过来！"

"Stay here," Viko commanded. He sprinted towards the coming assailant, dodged the blow aiming to bash his skull, and connected a swift elbow strike on the man's chin. The sailor collapsed, unconscious, but more voices and what sounded like a dozen more men resonated through the halls. "Blyat."  
"待在这儿，"维科命令道。他朝着迎面而来的袭击者冲去，躲开了对方想要砸碎他脑袋的一击，然后迅速用肘击击中了那人的下巴。水手倒下，不省人事，但更多的声音和听起来像是十几个人更多的脚步声在走廊里回荡。"该死。"

Gunshots echoed next, and a bullet impacted a few inches away from Shinji's face. Viko pointed towards a small vent near the gate, rising to his feet with the wrench in hand. Once he was out of sight, Viko faced the next four attackers, disarming them with relative ease and knocking them unconscious with precise, brutal strikes.  
枪声紧接着响起，一颗子弹擦着真嗣的脸几英寸飞过。维科指向大门附近的一个小通风口，手里拿着扳手站起身来。一旦他消失在视线之外，维科面对接下来的四个攻击者，相对轻松地夺走了他们的武器，并用精准而残酷的打击将他们击晕。

"Asuka's in trouble," Shinji repeated quietly. "Misato, please. Asuka's in trouble. Let me help."  
"明日香遇到麻烦了，" 真嗣再次轻声重复道，"美里，求你了。明日香有危险。让我帮忙吧。"

"Eh, lucky shot," Viko said as he wiped off sweat and blood from his brow. "They were carrying the malware I needed to open this door."  
"哎，运气不错的一击，" 维克托说着擦去额头上的汗水和血迹，"他们携带了我需要用来打开这扇门的恶意软件。"

_Hurry up, hurry up! Open, you stupid door,_ Shinji's mind wailed. His hands clenched and unclenched, ribcage burning with anxiousness. _I can do something, I can finally do something! Please!_  
快点，快点！开门啊，你这愚蠢的门，真嗣的内心焦急地呼喊着。他的双手紧握又松开，胸腔因焦虑而灼热。我能做些什么，我终于能做些什么了！求你了！

"Please," he urged. Viko continued to punch numbers into the PDA, growling and muttering curses in a foreign language after every failed attempt. "I have to help her."  
“求你了，”他恳求道。Viko 继续在 PDA 上输入数字，每次尝试失败后都用外语低声咒骂，发出咆哮。“我必须帮她。”

"And you will," Viko bit out, jaw clenched. "Blyat, I can't decode it yet. Every time I bypass a firewall, a new one takes its place. But I'll get it, don't worr-"  
“你会的，”Viko 咬牙切齿地说，下巴紧绷。“该死，我还解不开。每次我绕过一个防火墙，新的就出现了。但我会的，别担心——”

The most violent turbulence yet almost slammed both Shinji and Viko to the roof. They held on to whatever they could while a wall of fire consumed the hallway to their left. More shouting could be heard, desperate this time. Shinji's ears were ringing; Viko was mouthing out words he could not understand, and bleeding from somewhere above his right brow. The man glared death at the PDA, to no avail.  
最剧烈的颠簸几乎将真嗣和 Viko 甩到了天花板上。他们紧紧抓住能抓的一切，而一道火墙吞噬了他们左侧的走廊。这次传来的呼喊更加绝望。真嗣的耳朵嗡嗡作响；Viko 在说着他听不懂的话，从右眉上方某处流血。他怒视着 PDA，却无济于事。

A myriad of footfalls shook the ground. Way too many crewmen for Viko to handle alone, even if he was somehow so good at fighting. Shinji's heart raced further. _If I lose hope, if I stop believing in Misato and Asuka, then it's all over. Strength. Courage. Purpose. Earn, Shinji. Earn that roundel._  
无数脚步声震动了地面。对于 Viko 来说，即使他战斗技巧再高超，也难以独自应对如此众多的船员。真嗣的心跳加速。如果我失去希望，如果我不再相信美里和明日香，那么一切就结束了。力量。勇气。目标。真嗣，争取那个圆徽章。

The sailors, some armed and some urgent, ran towards them with fury and dread in their eyes. Viko placed himself between Shinji and the gate, intent on serving as a human shield if necessary. Just as the first bullets started impacting their vicinity, however, a thundering mechanic wail diverted their attention towards the opening gate.  
水手们，有的武装着，有的急切着，带着愤怒和恐惧的眼神向他们冲来。Viko 站在真嗣和大门之间，决心必要时充当人肉盾牌。然而，就在第一批子弹开始落在他们附近时，一声震耳欲聋的机械哀鸣将他们的注意力引向了正在开启的大门。

"In here, quick!" the Captain yelled from within the hangar. "Hurry up, Shinji!"  
“快进来！”从机库内传来了船长的喊声。“快点，真嗣！”

And so, hope was rekindled.  
于是，希望重新燃起。

"Misato!" Shinji pulled at Viko's arm. "Let's go!"  
"美里！" 真嗣拉住维科的手臂。"我们走吧！"

They pushed through the infinitesimal opening, stumbling into the massive chamber that stank of LCL, and both collapsed on the ground to catch their breath. Before him, Shinji saw Misato without her glasses for what felt like the first time in fourteen years.  
他们挤过那微小的缝隙，跌跌撞撞地进入那个弥漫着 LCL 气味的巨大房间，两人都倒在地上喘息。在真嗣面前，他看到美里摘下了眼镜，仿佛十四年来第一次这样。

"You said anything, right?" Misato said as she knelt before him. Her hand squeezed Shinji's shoulder. "We're at the end of our rope. Unit 08 is surrounded, and Asuka's abandoning her humanity to stop Unit 13. Your father is planning to bring about his own impact, and he needs Asuka for that."  
"你说过任何事都可以，对吧？" 美里跪在他面前说道。她的手紧紧握住真嗣的肩膀。"我们已经走投无路了。8 号机被包围，明日香正在放弃她的人性以阻止 13 号机。你的父亲计划引发他自己的冲击，而他需要明日香来实现这一点。"

"I'll pilot Unit 01," Shinji replied, resolute. "I promise I'll bring Asuka back, whatever it takes. I'll… settle things with my father. Let me take half of this burden from you."  
"我会驾驶 1 号机，" 真嗣坚定地回答，"我保证无论付出什么代价，我都会把明日香带回来。我会……和父亲做个了断。让我为你分担一半的负担。"

"That means you'll have to fight Gendo Ikari," Misato said. Shinji's gaze did not waver. "You grew up," she adorned with a hesitant smile. Her gaze softened, while her other hand pressed the plugsuit on Shinji's chest. The DSS choker was disarmed, and removed from Shinji's neck. "I'm sorry for… everything."  
"这意味着你必须与碇源堂战斗，" 美里说。真嗣的目光没有动摇。"你长大了，" 她带着一丝犹豫的微笑说道。她的目光变得柔和，另一只手按在真嗣胸前的插入栓服上。DSS 项圈被解除武装，并从真嗣的脖子上取下。"我很抱歉……为这一切。"

"So am I." Shinji smiled back. He changed as they walked towards the Eva. "Y-"  
"我也是。" 真嗣回以微笑。他们走向 Eva 时，他的态度变了。"等-"

"Wait a second!" "等一下！"

Sakura and Midori stood by the gate. Midori trembled with rage and exhaustion, Sakura trembled with dread.  
樱花和绿站在大门旁。绿因愤怒和疲惫而颤抖，樱花则因恐惧而颤抖。

"I knew it." Midori snarled at the Captain. "Leaving command in the midst of an attack, tsk. You're not seriously going to let him pilot, are you? This is why you went running while we're sinking?"  
"我就知道。" 美里对队长咆哮道，"在攻击中离开指挥岗位，啧。你真的打算让他驾驶吗？这就是你逃跑的原因，而我们却在沉没？"

"We knew something like this would happen," she carried on, and aimed her pistol straight at Shinji's head. "You authorized us to shoot to kill in situations like this, right, Captain? You're a plague!" she told Shinji. "The Impact you started made our lives a living hell! This is all yours and your father's fault! I'll never forgive either of you!"  
"我们早就料到会有这种事，" 她继续说道，将手枪直指真嗣的头部。"你授权我们在这种情况下可以开枪射杀，对吧，队长？你是个祸害！" 她对真嗣说，"你引发的冲击让我们生活在地狱中！这都是你和你父亲的错！我永远不会原谅你们两个！"

A bullet bounced off the floor near Shinji's foot. Sakura's hands trembled, sidearm dangling in her grip as tears streamed down her face. "Shinji Ikari won't pilot the Eva!" she declared in a shaky voice. "He piloted an Eva before and brought misfortune on all of us, and upon himself! I-I can't let you! Please stop!"  
一颗子弹在真嗣脚边弹开。樱的手颤抖着，手枪在她手中摇晃，泪水顺着脸颊流下。"真嗣不会驾驶 Eva！" 她用颤抖的声音宣布，"他之前驾驶过 Eva，给我们所有人，包括他自己，带来了不幸！我不能让你这么做！请停下来！"

"I'm sorry, Miss Sakura," Shinji said, facing her. He felt calm, devoid of fear. "I have to pilot the Eva, I have to help Asuka. Please understand."  
"对不起，小樱小姐，" 真嗣面对着她说道。他感到平静，无所畏惧。"我必须驾驶 Eva，我必须帮助明日香。请理解我。"

"No! You don't understand I _can't_ let you!" Sakura responded. Her eyes moved from Shinji to Midori in desperation and terror. Midori snarled, and was about to point her own pistol at Shinji's head when Sakura next spoke. "My brother said not to hurt you, but that's the only way to stop you right now! I swear it'll only hurt a little! Please bear with me!"  
"不！你不明白，我不能让你去！" 小樱回应道。她的目光从真嗣转向绿，充满了绝望和恐惧。绿咆哮着，正要将手中的枪指向真嗣的头部，小樱紧接着说道："我哥哥说不许伤害你，但这是唯一能阻止你的方法！我发誓只会痛一下！请忍耐一下！"

Misato stepped in front of Shinji and pushed him out of the way. A gunshot reverberated through the hangar. Sakura's pistol dropped from her hands with a kick thrown at blinding speed. The wrench flew through the air and slammed on Midori's hands. An arm wrapped around the pink haired woman's neck and squeezed, rendering her unconscious.  
美里挡在真嗣前面，将他推开。一声枪响在机库中回荡。小樱的手枪以惊人的速度被一脚踢飞。扳手在空中飞过，重重地砸在绿的手上。一只手臂环住粉发女子的脖子，用力一勒，使她失去了意识。

"Blyat," Viko whispered. Shinji saw a red stain spread around his white-blue shirt. "You two need a little lemonade in your lives."  
"妈的," Viko 低声咒骂。真嗣看到他蓝白衬衫上逐渐扩散的红色血迹。"你们俩的生活需要来点柠檬水。"

"Viko!" Shinji screamed. He ran to the man's side ad caught him before he fell. "Somebody, we need to stop the bleeding!"  
"Viko!" 真嗣尖叫起来。他跑到那人身边，在他倒下前扶住了他。"谁来帮帮忙，我们必须止血！"

"I'll be fine," Viko pushed him away with a smile, and pointed to Unit 01's nape. The armor peeled away, revealing the Entry Plug. "Go. My little brother's counting on you."  
"我没事," Viko 带着微笑推开他，指向初号机后颈。装甲剥落，露出了插入栓。"去吧。我的小弟弟正指望你呢。"

"No! This wasn't… this wasn't supposed to happen!" Sakura uttered in despair, falling to her knees. "Mr. Viko, Captain… why would y-"  
"不！这不应该……这不应该发生的！" 樱绝望地喃喃自语，跪倒在地。"维克先生，队长……你们为什么要……"

"Even if Third Impact was started fourteen years ago, I'm still grateful to Shinji," Misato interrupted. She ripped a piece of the jacket and pressed it against Viko's wound. "Had it not been for Shinji piloting Unit 01, we would have all been exterminated then. I'm still Shinji Ikari's guardian, so I'll take full responsibility for his actions henceforth."  
"即使第三次冲击是在十四年前开始的，我仍然感激真嗣，" 美里打断道。她撕下一块夹克布料，按在维克的伤口上。"如果不是真嗣驾驶初号机，我们那时就全军覆没了。我仍然是真嗣·碇的监护人，所以从今往后，我将对他的一切行为负全责。"

"Misato…" Shinji whispered, eyes wide.  
"美里……" 真嗣低声说道，眼睛睁得大大的。

"That's right!" Sakura cried. "Shinji Ikari is our savior and our destroyer! All I wanted was for him to be safe, and away from the Eva! All I wanted was for my family to be safe! And now... I... this is all-"  
"没错！" 樱大声说道。"碇真嗣既是我们的救星也是我们的毁灭者！我所希望的只是他能安全，远离 Eva！我所希望的只是我的家人能安全！而现在...我...这一切都..."

"Right now," said the Captain. "I'll entrust everything to Shinji."  
"现在，" 队长说道。"我将把一切都托付给真嗣。"

Kaworu appeared next to the Entry Plug. _Asuka's in trouble. We can't waste any more time. I'll apologize to Miss Sakura properly later._ Shinji ran towards the Entry Plug, tearing away at his clothes. "Look after Viko!" he yelled. The plugsuit compressed around his body.  
渚薰出现在插入栓旁。明日香有危险。我们不能再浪费时间了。稍后我会好好向樱小姐道歉。真嗣朝着插入栓跑去，撕扯着自己的衣服。"照顾好维克！"他喊道。驾驶服紧贴着他的身体。

The main hangar gate opened, and a barrage of bullets impacted against the Entry Plug as Shinji climbed. Something nipped at his shoulders, but he barely felt it. LCL filled the small space in seconds, a kaleidoscope of colors washed over him, and a very familiar face appeared in his mind.  
主船坞大门缓缓开启，一连串子弹击打在插入栓上，而真嗣正攀爬着。有什么东西轻咬着他的肩膀，但他几乎感觉不到。LCL 在几秒内充满了这个小空间，五彩斑斓的颜色涌向他，一张非常熟悉的面孔浮现在他的脑海中。

"Ayanami," Shinji said. His eyes started to glow violet. "I'm happy to see you. Can you lend me your strength?"  
“绫波，”真嗣说道。他的眼睛开始闪烁着紫光。“见到你真高兴。你能借给我你的力量吗？”

---

"Angel blood… full insertion!"  
“天使之血……完全插入！”

The liquid felt like fire. Asuka's body burned, every cell fought against the spread of infection, yet she embraced the angel's power fully and pushed forward. She withered, and Unit 02 withered alongside her. The armor cracked, the facial mask broke, her Evangelion roared in agony.  
那液体如同烈火。明日香的身躯燃烧着，每个细胞都在抵抗感染的蔓延，然而她全然接纳了使徒的力量，勇往直前。她日渐憔悴，二号机也与她一同凋零。装甲裂开，面罩破碎，她的福音战士痛苦咆哮。

"_Princess, stop!"_ Mari's voice lost all of its playful ring. She was pleading, desperate. _"You won't be human anymore!"_  
“公主，停下！”真希波的声音失去了所有玩味的调调。她在恳求，绝望至极。“你将不再为人！”

_No other way, this is my last chance,_ Asuka thought amidst the suffering. _Do this impossible thing!_  
别无他法，这是我最后的机会，明日香在痛苦中思索。做这件不可能的事！

Unit 02 forced its way out of the armored body, eyes glistening. Its lost arm regenerated. With a final defiant scream, a new giant of light began to grow, many times bigger than any Evangelion or Angel. Wings, a wild, velvet mane and two more arms grew out of the new, hybrid lifeform.  
初号机 02 强行突破了装甲外壳，双眼闪烁着光芒。它失去的手臂再生了。随着一声最后的反抗尖叫，一个新的光之巨人开始成长，比任何 EVA 或使徒都要大上许多倍。翅膀、狂野的丝绒鬃毛和另外两条手臂从这个新的混合生命体中生长出来。

Inside the Entry Plug, Asuka's eyes glistened blue and green. "I'll neutralize Unit 02's AT-Field," she growled. "With my own!"  
在插入栓内，明日香的眼睛闪烁着蓝绿色。“我要中和初号机 02 的 AT 力场，”她咆哮道，“用我自己的！”

The newly grown arms gripped the barrier. Slowly, a gap began to manifest. _One more step! To hell with my humanity! That idiot has some trees he has to take care of! This is for a world where he can be safe!_  
新长出的手臂紧紧抓住了屏障。慢慢地，一道裂缝开始显现。再进一步！去他的我的人性！那个白痴还有些树要照顾！这是为了一个他能安全的世界！

"_Asuka!"_ Shinji screamed in her mind. The AT-Field broke away, and the slight distraction gave Asuka time to move away from a massive blast. "What the hell," she ground out. One of her arms had burned to cinders while the other still held the weapon. "That thing wasn't supposed be activated yet!"  
"明日香！" 真嗣在她的心中尖叫。AT 力场崩溃，这一瞬间的分神给了明日香躲避巨大爆炸的机会。"搞什么鬼，"她咬牙切齿地说。她的一只手臂已被烧成灰烬，而另一只手仍紧握着武器。"那东西不应该这么快就被激活的！"

The twin plugs faded within Unit 13's core. The behemoth levitated away from its bounds, limbs loose as if made of rubber and not flesh. Asuka sprang away from a second, third and fourth blast, firing one of her own to little effect.  
双插头在十三号机核心内逐渐消失。巨兽从束缚中悬浮起来，四肢松弛，仿佛由橡胶而非血肉构成。明日香从第二次、第三次和第四次爆炸中弹开，发射了自己的攻击，但效果甚微。

"God damn it," she grunted. Her 'lost' limb continued to ache while her body burned away under the Angel infection. "The bastard baited me into this. Well, you'll have to try harder!"  
"该死，"她咕哝着。她那'失去'的手臂持续作痛，而身体在使徒感染下不断燃烧。"那混蛋引我入局。哼，你得再努力点才行！"

Unit 02's slim arms grabbed hold of Unit 13's shoulders and slammed it against the pyramid walls. A cross-shaped explosion manifested afterwards. "Your puny little blasts are _nothing_ to me!" Asuka screamed. "You're not getting away!"  
02 号机纤细的手臂紧紧抓住 13 号机的肩膀，猛地将其撞向金字塔的墙壁。随后，一个十字形的爆炸显现。“你那微不足道的攻击对我毫无作用！”明日香尖叫道，“你休想逃脱！”

The enemy Eva got to its feet with little difficulty. It began to walk towards her, unperturbed by the continued assaults of her AT-Field. Unit 02's form began to shrink in size. The hybrid focused both its essence, that of Asuka and of Bardiel into the weapon, which glistened and became a large cross.  
敌对的 EVA 轻松地站起身来，继续向她走来，对她的 AT 力场持续攻击毫不在意。02 号机的身形开始缩小。这台混合体将明日香和巴迪尔的本质集中于武器之中，那武器闪闪发光，化作一个巨大的十字架。

"I'm not letting you get to the Black Moon," Asuka declared. _You're poison. All you do is hurt everyone, even your own son. No more._ "Gendo Ikari!"  
“我不会让你接近黑色月亮，”明日香宣告，“你是毒害。你所做的一切只会伤害每一个人，甚至包括你自己的儿子。到此为止了。“碇源堂！”

Unit 13 clashed against the tip of the cross, fading out of sight and manifesting right before Unit 02 in a flash. Asuka pushed the weapon to the core which was held by all four hands of the purple Eva. For a moment, she felt the cross penetrate the enemy's armor.  
13 号机与十字架的尖端猛烈碰撞，随即消失在视野中，一瞬间又闪现在 02 号机前方。明日香将武器推向紫色 EVA 的四只手中紧握的核心。那一刻，她感觉到十字架穿透了敌人的装甲。

Then the cross, her other arm and a portion of her torso were scorched away. Her scream rang through the pyramid, up to the skies, and straight into Shinji's ears.  
紧接着，十字架、她的另一只手臂以及部分躯干被烧毁。她的尖叫声在金字塔内回荡，直冲云霄，清晰地传入真嗣的耳中。

"No!" Asuka forced Unit 02 to its feet even as it shrunk further. Her hand smashed the panel that contained the self- destruct trigger. "Not giving up yet, you bastard! If I can't stop you, I'm taking you with me straight to hell!"  
“不！”明日香迫使 02 号机站起，尽管它进一步缩小。她的手猛击包含自毁触发器的面板。“还没放弃呢，混蛋！如果我阻止不了你，我就带你一起下地狱！”

She leaped towards her prey, but Unit 13 was quicker. It drove an arm right below where Asuka's collarbone would have been. Unit 02 coughed blue blood on the behemoth's mask, most of its mighty body faded away or exploded into LCL. With blue and golden intermingling underneath, Unit 02's eyes came alive one final time. The Eva wrapped its remaining leg and wings around Unit 13.  
她向猎物猛扑过去，但 13 号机动作更快。它一臂直插阿斯纳的锁骨下方。02 号机咳出蓝色血液，溅在巨兽的面具上，其强大的身躯大部分消散或爆炸成 LCL。蓝色与金色交织之下，02 号机的双眼最后一次闪耀。EVA 用剩下的腿和翅膀紧紧缠绕住 13 号机。

"Thanks for the chance," Asuka coughed, tinges of crimson falling onto her lap. "Goodbye, Idiot-Shinji."  
“谢谢你给的机会，”阿斯纳咳着，几缕鲜红落在她的膝上。“再见了，笨蛋真嗣。”

Darkness shrouded the entry plug before she could pull the trigger. The pain began to dissipate as she floated there, with the very own glow of her body as the only remaining light. Bardiel was trembling within, screaming into her very soul.  
黑暗笼罩了插入栓，她还没来得及扣动扳机。疼痛开始消退，她漂浮在那里，只剩下自己身体发出的光芒。巴迪尔在内部颤抖，对着她的灵魂尖叫。

"What… is that?" Asuka's eyes fixed on a cerulean splendor ahead. It began to cover everything around her, with invisible, cold, dead hands gripping at her, prodding, inspecting. "Get the hell off me!"  
"这…是什么？" 明日香的双眼紧盯着前方的一片蔚蓝光辉。它开始覆盖她周围的一切，无形、冰冷、死寂的手紧抓着她，探查，审视。"滚开！"

A figure akin to her own manifested. Its eyes caressed her frame, playful and full of deceit. The LCL felt frigid, the DSS choker stifled Asuka's breathing. Laughter echoed all around as it walked forward, crouching to touch her face.  
一个与她相似的身影显现出来。它的目光在她身上游走，戏谑而充满欺骗。LCL 液体感觉冰冷，DSS 项圈扼住了明日香的呼吸。笑声在四周回荡，它向前走去，蹲下身触摸她的脸颊。

"Shikinami type," she said, glaring at the apparition. "My original, huh."  
"式波型，" 她瞪着那幻影说道，"我的原型，是吧。"

"The last Eva's form mirrors that of God," it said, wearing a confident smile. "All you need to do is accept me and my love. Now," it whispered, extending its hands forward. "Come to me."  
"最后一台 EVA 的形态反映了上帝的形象，"它带着自信的微笑说道。"你只需接受我和我的爱。现在，"它低语着，向前伸出双手。"来到我这里。"

Asuka clawed at the figure, but when her hands passed through its body without effect, the last sliver of hope in her heart faded, replaced by wrath. "Well, tough luck," she growled, and ripped away the DSS choker's seal. Her hand tightened around the red roundel. "I'm not exactly the accepting kind."  
明日香抓向那个身影，但当她的手毫无阻碍地穿过它的身体时，她心中最后的一丝希望破灭了，取而代之的是愤怒。"好吧，算你倒霉，"她咆哮着，撕开了 DSS 项圈的封印。她的手紧紧握住红色的圆盘。"我可不是那种轻易接受的人。"

Panic rose to her throat when the apparition took a hold of her head. Asuka felt her very essence being pulled towards the blue flame. "That's pointless, little idio-"  
当幽灵抓住她的头时，恐慌涌上她的喉咙。明日香感觉到自己的本质正被拉向那蓝色的火焰。"那是徒劳的，小傻瓜-"

A beam of mauve light burst from the Wunder. In a second, many of the Eva 07 Series surrounding the pyramid were incinerated. The arm Unit 13 had used to impale Unit 02 was severed, and the beam concentrated on the behemoth's chest, forcing it back. Stone melted into liquid and glass with the following explosion.  
一道紫罗兰色的光束从 Wunder 号喷薄而出。转眼间，围绕金字塔的许多 Eva 07 系列机体被焚毁。13 号机用于刺穿 02 号机的那只手臂被切断，光束集中于巨兽的胸膛，迫使其后退。石块在随后的爆炸中熔化为液体和玻璃。

---

Unit 01's eyes came alive.  
01 号机的双眼焕发出生命力。

"Father," Shinji rasped inside the Entry Plug. "Please stay away from Asuka."  
“父亲，”真嗣在插入栓内嘶哑地说，“请远离明日香。”

The Eva sprung out of the Wunder and darted towards the pyramid like a bullet, which cracked in half once it landed. The arm it had lost against Zeruel shone back into existence while the other took hold of Unit 02's crumbling form. Knowledge he was not meant to understand and power he was not supposed to wield flowed calmly through his being.  
Eva 从 Wunder 号上一跃而出，如子弹般冲向金字塔，落地时将其一分为二。在与 Zeruel 战斗中失去的手臂重新闪现，而另一只手则紧紧抓住了 Unit 02 那摇摇欲坠的身躯。那些本不该理解的知识和不应掌握的力量，此刻却平静地流淌在他的体内。

_Is there a way?_ Shinji asked the First Child's shadow. _Can I help her? Can I take away that curse?_  
有办法吗？真嗣向第一适格者的影子问道。我能帮她吗？我能解除那个诅咒吗？

"_The Ninth is a cowardly one,"_ Rei Ayanami whispered. Her calm expression and warm smile comforted him. _"It will attach itself to a new host if it means survival. There is a price to pay, though. I cannot ensure you will remain human after this, Shinji-kun."_  
“第九使徒是个胆小的家伙，”绫波零轻声说道。她平静的表情和温暖的微笑让他感到安慰。“为了生存，它会依附于新的宿主。但这需要付出代价。我无法保证你之后还能保持人类的身份，真嗣君。”

_That's okay. Do it,_ he replied. Unit 13 got back to its feet and roared, so Shinji fired another blast and made it fall back several hundred feet. _I had hoped… to be able to fish a bit more. Get better at pottery, learn carpentry and agriculture. Read. But I'll be okay. Right, Ayanami?_  
没关系。做吧，他回答道。13 号机重新站起并咆哮着，于是真嗣又发射了一束攻击，使其后退了数百英尺。我曾希望……能再多钓几次鱼。提高陶艺水平，学习木工和农耕。读书。但我没事的。对吧，绫波？

"_Very well."_ Rei nodded. _"I'll hold him off."_  
“很好。”绫波点头道，“我会拖住他。”

Every time Unit 13 teleported back, it was struck by another beam and pushed away. The four-armed Evangelion roared as the purple armor took on the color of bone. It fired its own attack, which was held off by an AT-Field so massive that it sliced through the remnants of the pyramid.  
每次 13 号机传送回来，都会被另一束光束击中并推开。四臂的福音战士咆哮着，紫色装甲逐渐变成了骨白色。它发射了自己的攻击，却被一个巨大的 AT 力场挡住，这个力场如此强大，以至于切穿了金字塔的残骸。

Unit 01's regenerated arm gently lay on Unit 02's chest, fading within its body ever so slowly. A navy-blue substance bubbled out of the wound in the Eva's chest and began to crawl through the glistening arm, developing claws and veins that pierced through both light and armor.  
初号机再生的手臂轻轻搭在零号机胸前，缓缓融入其体内。一种深蓝色的物质从 EVA 胸口的伤口中冒出，开始沿着闪亮的手臂蔓延，生出利爪和脉络，穿透了光与装甲。

When Shinji next opened his eyes, he was standing next to Asuka's control station. Time slugged its way to a complete halt. Something floated near his face, crimson droplets emanating from his shoulder.  
当真嗣再次睁开眼睛时，他正站在明日香的控制台旁。时间仿佛完全停滞。有什么东西飘浮在他脸旁，鲜红的血滴从他的肩膀渗出。

"S-Shinji?" Asuka said. "What are you doing here? _How_ are you here?" Her eyes… both of them narrowed in his direction. "You're injured. What's going on?"  
“真-真嗣？”明日香问道，“你在这里做什么？你怎么会在这里？”她的双眼……都朝他这边眯了起来。“你受伤了。发生什么事了？”

_Beautiful,_ Shinji thought, entranced by how her hair danced and shone, as if alive. "I'll be okay," he replied, and knelt before her. His hand clasped around her cheek. The cross marking around Asuka's pupil began to close. He smiled. "Not fair, you left without giving me a chance to say anything."  
真美，真嗣心想，被她的头发舞动闪耀的样子迷住了，仿佛有生命一般。“我会没事的，”他回答道，然后跪在她面前。他的手轻抚着她的脸颊。围绕着明日香瞳孔的十字标记开始闭合。他微笑着。“不公平，你离开都没给我机会说些什么。”

"What the hell is happening!" Asuka demanded, but quickly lost her strength. Her arms fell on his shoulders as her consciousness faded. "Shinji, what are you doing?"  
“这到底是怎么回事！”明日香质问道，但很快失去了力气。她的双臂垂落在他的肩膀上，意识逐渐模糊。“真嗣，你在做什么？”

"I like you too, you know," Shinji said simply. Her eyes, now healed and fully human, blinked at him in shock. The DSS choker deactivated. "I'm sorry. I don't think I'll be able to cook lunch like I promised. Remember to name your trees after they bear fruit."  
“我也喜欢你，你知道的，”真嗣简单地说道。她那已经痊愈、完全恢复人性的眼睛震惊地眨了眨。DSS 项圈随之失效。“对不起。我想我无法像承诺的那样为你做午饭了。记得在它们结果后给你的树命名。”

"Stop this nonsense," she slurred. Her fists softly impacted against Shinji's chest. "You're the one supposed to be doing… the boring stuff…"  
"别闹了，"她含糊地说道。她的拳头轻轻地捶打在真嗣的胸口。"你才是该去做……那些无聊的事的人……"

Bardiel's soul clamped onto his own, shivering, hoping for a few more seconds of sentient existence. No more would days pass and see Asuka's body and mind unchanged, no more would she spend her nights staring off into the distance, denied of rest. He saw the roundel held firmly in her grip even as she fell unconscious.  
巴迪尔的灵魂紧紧依附在他的身上，颤抖着，渴望再多几秒钟的意识存在。不再会有日子流逝而明日香的身体和心灵毫无变化，不再会有她夜夜凝视远方，被剥夺休息的时刻。他看到她紧握着圆盘，即使在昏迷中也不放手。

"Haven't earned it yet, I guess," Shinji whispered. The angel's infection ran rampant in his body, overloading his senses with agony, but he clenched his jaw and focused on Asuka's sleeping face. "Goodbye, Asuka. Say hi to everyone for me."  
"看来我还没挣到这个资格，"真嗣低声说。天使的感染在他体内肆虐，用痛苦淹没他的感官，但他紧咬牙关，专注于明日香沉睡的面容。"再见，明日香。替我向大家问好。"

Unit 02's remains dropped to the ground, lifeless after having protected its pilot until the final moment. Shinji stared at the Entry Plug for a few precious seconds while the corruption covered Unit 01's arm in its entirety.  
02 号机的残骸坠落地面，在最后一刻保护了驾驶员后变得毫无生气。真嗣凝视着插入栓，几秒钟的宝贵时间流逝，而污染完全覆盖了 01 号机的手臂。

"Miss Mari!" he screamed. The pink Evangelion peeked from above. "Keep her safe!"  
“真希波小姐！”他尖叫道。粉红色的福音战士从上方探出头来。“保护好她！”

"_You got it, Puppy!"_  “包在我身上，小狗狗！”

Focusing his AT-Field around the plug, Shinji propelled it above and out of his father's reach. Once it landed in Unit 08's palm, he was able to breathe again.  
将 AT 力场集中在插入栓周围，真嗣推动它升空，脱离了父亲的掌控范围。一旦插入栓落入 08 号机的掌中，他才得以再次呼吸。

"Father," he said. "I was hoping we could talk."  
“父亲，”他说道，“我希望我们能谈谈。”

Unit 13 roared again and summoned both spears into its grip.  
13 号机再次咆哮，同时召唤出两把长矛紧握在手中。

"There is no need for conversation," Gendo Ikari replied. His voice carried all the way into the Wunder. "You have brought Unit 01 back to me, and assimilated the 9th Angel into yourself. You have my gratitude, Shinji." The Eva moved with blinding speed and impaled Unit 01's arms with each spear. "Let us be quick about this. I have deeds to perform."  
"无需多言，"碇源堂回应道。他的声音传遍了 Wunder 号。"你已将初号机带回我身边，并自行融合了第九使徒。我感谢你，真嗣。" 初号机以惊人的速度行动，用每支长矛刺穿了零号机的双臂。"让我们速战速决。我还有事情要办。"

"Sorry," Shinji grunted. His eyes turned scarlet. "Mother insists."  
"对不起，"真嗣咕哝着。他的眼睛变成了猩红色。"母亲坚持如此。"

The infected arm coiled around one of the spears and stole it from its wielder. Unit 01 kicked the behemoth away with little effort as the spear of Cassius reshaped itself. Chaos erupted around the ruin of NERV HQ. The sky turned red all around the world, and the rites of Fourth Impact began undeterred.  
被感染的手臂缠绕在一支长矛上，从其持有者手中夺走。初号机轻松一脚将巨兽踢开，卡修斯之矛随即重塑形态。NERV 总部废墟周围爆发了混乱。全球的天空都变成了红色，第四次冲击的仪式开始不受阻碍地进行。

"How naïve, child," Gendo said. Unit 13 levitated back to the battlefield. "You have abandoned Katsuragi to her fate, all to save the Shikinami pilot, who was created to serve this purpose alone. No matter."  
"多么天真，孩子，" 碇源堂说道。十三号机悬浮着返回战场。"你为了拯救只为此目的而创造的式波驾驶员，放弃了葛城美里的命运。无所谓了。"

---

_No wonder Shinji's last recorded synch rate was zero. It was the closest value the system could associate it with.  
难怪真嗣最后一次记录的同步率为零。这是系统能与之关联的最接近的值。_

"Unit 02 signal has gone dark! Pilot's status unknown!"  
"二号机信号已消失！驾驶员状态未知！"

"Heavy damage reported to the main generator!"  
"主发电机遭受严重损坏！"

"Damn it, what now? Something like an Eva attached itself to the ship!"  
"该死，现在又是什么情况？像是 Eva 一样的东西附在了船上！"

"Pattern blue," Ritsuko said. Her eyes darted away from Unit 01's status. "It's comparable to the Mark. 09. They built it from scratch?"  
"蓝色模式，" 律子说道。她的目光从 01 号机的状态上移开。"这和 Mark. 09 相当。他们是完全从零开始建造的吗？"

The enemy walked on the Wunder's hull unperturbed and unchallenged. Once it reached the main generator, its body began to decompose into a gelatinous mass that easily crawled through the crevices created during battle.  
敌人毫不在意、无人阻拦地走在奇迹号的船体上。一旦到达主发电机处，它的身体便开始分解成胶状物质，轻松爬过战斗中产生的裂缝。

"This is bad! The ship's being infiltrated!" Aoba screamed.  
“这太糟糕了！船正在被渗透！”青叶尖叫道。

"Expunge it, now!" Ritsuko ordered through the comm.  
“立即清除它！”律子通过通讯器命令道。

"We're trying, but the contamination speed is too great!" Maya replied. Despair riddled the entire ship. "We can't keep up!"  
"我们正在努力，但污染速度太快了！" 真希波回答道。绝望笼罩了整艘船。"我们跟不上！"

"Our system's being hacked!" Shigeru wailed. "No, no, no! What the hell are we supposed to do now?"  
"我们的系统被黑了！" 四郎哭喊道。"不，不，不！我们现在该怎么办？"

"Don't panic!" Ritsuko commanded. "Concentrate on reducing casualties! Isolate command's system from the rest of the ship!"  
"不要慌！" 律子命令道。"集中精力减少伤亡！将指挥系统与船的其他部分隔离！"

"It's no use, the Mark 09 has broken through the fire wall! We're about to be locked out!"  
"没用的，Mark 09 已经突破了防火墙！我们马上就要被锁在外面了！"

_No. There's still hope.  不，还有希望。_

The enemy Evangelion was sliced in half from afar by the very same beam that had extinguished Zeruel. "Our Captain put her hopes on Shinji, so act accordingly!" Ritsuko said. "The infiltration stopped! All hands, evasive maneuvers! Disengage from ship no.4!"  
敌方的 EVA 被同一束光线从远处劈成两半，那光线正是消灭 Zeruel 的那一道。“我们的队长把希望寄托在真嗣身上，所以行动要与之相符！”律子说道。“入侵停止了！全体注意，规避动作！脱离四号舰！”

"These readings," Takao muttered. His eyes remained glued to the screen. "Is this right?"  
"这些读数，" 高雄喃喃自语。他的眼睛紧盯着屏幕。"这正确吗？"

"Yes." Ritsuko glowered. Her cold glare fixated on Unit 13. "Shinji's synch rate is infinite."  
"是的。" 律子皱眉。她冰冷的目光锁定在 13 号机上。"真嗣的同步率是无穷大。"

**To Be Continued…  未完待续……**

### Chapter 10 Iron. Lion. Zion.
Bones riddled every inch of the battlefield. Unit 01 took a step back to deflect the massive blast, crushing several skulls in the process. Corpses cracked under its feet, a mountain melted behind, and the broken earth quaked under the power of his father's monstrous Evangelion. His shoulder ached with no blood exiting the wound. Every fiber of his being was alive with pain as Bardiel made a home in his body. Shinji used the agony and adrenaline to focus the power surging through him, crystallizing in a blast.  
战场上每一寸土地都布满了骸骨。初号机后退一步，挡下巨大的爆炸，过程中碾碎了数颗头骨。尸体在其脚下破裂，身后如山般融化的景象，破碎的大地在父亲那怪物般的 EVA 力量下颤抖。他的肩膀因伤口而疼痛，没有血液流出。每一根神经都因痛苦而活跃，Bardiel 在他的体内安家。真嗣利用这痛苦和肾上腺素来集中涌动在他体内的力量，凝结成一次爆炸。

_Created for this?_ He thought in anger. _Like Rei, like Ayanami? How many have you 'created' and sacrificed for this scenario of yours?_  
为此而生？他愤怒地想。像零一样，像绫波吗？你为了你的这个剧本，‘创造’并牺牲了多少人？

"Father, you have to stop this!" Shinji screamed. Unit 13 crashed into him, swinging the spear left and right in an effort to eviscerate or impale him. He dodged, and parried with a strike of his own. "This world still has a chance. There are people fighting to survive and thrive this very moment! Are you simply going to destroy everything?"  
“父亲，你必须停止这一切！” 真嗣尖叫道。十三号机向他猛撞过来，左右挥舞着长矛，试图将他开膛破肚或刺穿。他闪避着，并用一击回敬。“这个世界仍有希望。此刻正有人为生存和繁荣而战！你难道要摧毁一切吗？”

"You understand nothing," Gendo boomed. The fabric of reality itself began to crack as the final rites of Fourth Impact concluded. "Once the scenario is fulfilled, there will be no more struggle."  
“你什么都不懂，” 源堂咆哮道。现实本身的结构开始破裂，第四次冲击的最终仪式即将完成。“一旦情景实现，将不再有挣扎。”

Dodging another heavy slash, Shinji pushed Unit 13 away with a kick. It felt like trying to move a brick wall, but he succeeded in pushing the enemy back a few hundred feet. _There are people counting on me. There are thing__s_ _I want to protect._ "Why can't we try to talk?" he tried again, and was met with a heavier blast. "It's what mother would have wanted!"  
躲过又一次沉重的一击，真嗣一脚将十三号机踢开。感觉就像试图移动一堵砖墙，但他成功地将敌人推后了几百英尺。有人在依靠我。有我想保护的东西。“为什么我们不能尝试沟通呢？”他再次尝试，却遭到了更猛烈的攻击。“这是母亲希望的！”

"Do not speak of her," growled Unit 13, moving too quickly for Shinji to register. The Lance of Longinus was tainted crimson with Unit 01's blood as it pierced its leg. "I have seen the outcome of your foolish efforts," Gendo carried on, hurling the impaled Unit 01 through the air, and onto a boulder. "There is nothing to gain in stopping the rites. Had you witnessed what I have witnessed, you would see _my_ scenario is a kinder fate."  
"不要提起她，"13 号机咆哮着，动作快得让真嗣无法反应。朗基努斯之枪被 01 号机的鲜血染成深红，刺穿了它的腿部。"我已经见识了你愚蠢努力的后果，"碇源堂继续说道，将刺穿的 01 号机猛掷出去，撞在一块巨石上。"阻止仪式毫无意义。如果你目睹了我所见的一切，你会明白我的计划是更仁慈的结局。"

Blood poured from Shinji's leg and cascaded down Unit 01's armor. Seconds later, the incision closed and bubbled out of existence. Rei's voice whispered the word 'caution' as he leaped forward. The following slash went through AT-Field, flesh and bone, it severed one of Unit 13's four arms only for it to regenerate in an instant. Both behemoths continued to exchange heavy blows while explosions reverberated from above.  
鲜血从真嗣的腿上涌出，顺着 01 号机的装甲流淌。几秒钟后，伤口闭合，消失无踪。绫波的声音轻声提醒着'小心'，他随即一跃而前。接下来的斩击穿透了 AT 力场、血肉和骨骼，切断了 13 号机的一条手臂，但那手臂瞬间再生。两头巨兽继续交换着沉重的打击，而上方爆炸声不断回荡。

A myriad of Evangelions spiraled to the Wunder yet again, making Shinji avert his eyes and almost get cut in half. Unit 01's glistened. The ensuing blast vaporized more than half of the enemy's forces and slowed down the attack long enough for the ship to evade. The spears met again and again, with each clash so powerful it cracked the pyramid into rubble.  
无数的 EVA 再次盘旋向 Wunder，使得真嗣不得不移开视线，差点被切成两半。初号机闪闪发光。随之而来的爆炸蒸发了敌方过半的兵力，并减缓了攻击，足以让飞船躲避。长矛一次又一次地碰撞，每一次撞击都如此强烈，以至于金字塔被震成了碎石。

"There is no point to this," snapped Gendo. "The promised land awaits. You will not stand between me and Yui."  
“这样做毫无意义，”源堂厉声道，“应许之地在等待。你休想挡在我和唯之间。”

Unit 13 clashed against Shinji and catapulted both mechas outside the battlefield. The sky shattered along with reality. The final rites began, collecting the energy of Wanderers and failed Evas littering the Earth's surface. His body froze. "I can't move…!" he ground out. The sky spiraled alongside him. "Father, let me go!"  
13 号机与真嗣的机体激烈碰撞，将两台机甲弹出了战场。天空与现实一同破碎。最后的仪式开始了，收集着遍布地球表面的流浪者和失败的 EVA 的能量。他的身体僵住了。“我动不了……！”他咬牙切齿地说。天空与他一同旋转。“父亲，放开我！”

"Yui," Shinji heard his father say. The Eva's mask glared up at him, red hatred gleaming directly from within Gendo's head. "We will be reunited soon."  
"Yui," 真嗣听到他父亲说道。Eva 的面具向他瞪视，Gendo 的头部内闪烁着红色的仇恨光芒。"我们很快就会重聚。"

_Asuka was right. Misato, Ritsuko, even Sakura, they all said he would stop at nothing._ Kensuke's words rang in his head regardless. The opportunity to understand his father was at hand, even if it meant fighting the man for it. _Remember what you want to protect._ All sense of orientation was lost. A melting scenery of white, red, purple and blue flashed through Shinji's eyes. He focused on the presence within the core and slowly regained his senses and motor functions.  
明日香说得对。美里、律子，甚至樱，他们都说过他会不择手段。尽管如此，健司的话仍在他脑海中回响。理解父亲的机会就在眼前，即便这意味着要与他对决。记住你要保护的东西。所有的方向感都消失了。一片融化的白色、红色、紫色和蓝色的景象在真嗣眼前闪过。他专注于核心中的存在，慢慢恢复了知觉和运动功能。

"What is this place?" he demanded. "Where are we?"  
"这是什么地方？" 他质问道。"我们在哪里？"

Something akin to a collection of crosses neared them. Impossibly massive, the structure attracted both combatants like a magnet would metal. The closer Shinji got, the easier it was to gaze at what seemed like thousands upon thousands of windows. Once again, Rei asked him to thread carefully. He felt it, whatever was in the core coiled in distress as they neared one of the crosses.  
一群十字架般的物体向他们逼近。那结构庞大得不可思议，像磁铁吸引金属一样吸引着双方。越靠近，那些看似成千上万的窗户就越容易辨认。Rei 再次提醒他要小心行事。他感受到了，无论核心中是什么，随着他们接近其中一个十字架，那种不安的缠绕感愈发强烈。

"This is the Golgotha Object." Gendo seemed to speak directly into his mind. "Beings not of this Earth left behind their spears, the Adams, and the world of the Gods." Unit 13 clenched its fists drawing Shinji close with a growl. "My wife, your mother, is in here as well. This is where everything started, and where it will end." The grip on Shinji's throat tightened. "There are so many things a man cannot change, but here… even fate may bend to one's will."  
“这就是各各他物体。”Gendo 的声音仿佛直接传入他的脑海，“非地球的生物留下了他们的矛，亚当们，以及神的世界。”十三号机紧握双拳，将 Shinji 拉近并发出低吼。“我的妻子，你的母亲，也在这里。一切的起点，也将在此终结。”对 Shinji 喉咙的握力加强了。“有许多事情是人无法改变的，但在这里……命运也可能屈服于人的意志。”

Glass breaking resonated in Shinji's ears. His eyes snapped open back at that strange hospital room, but before he could sit up the scenery changed to the Eva cages. _I'm still in Unit 01, I can feel Rei's presence and that warmth from the core._ "Father?" he turned to gaze at the horror of Gendo's ruined visage. "What is this?"  
玻璃破碎的声音在 Shinji 耳边回响。他的眼睛猛地睁开，回到了那个奇怪的医院房间，但还没等他坐起来，场景就切换到了 Eva 的笼子。我还在初号机里，我能感觉到 Rei 的存在和核心的温暖。“父亲？”他转向 Gendo 那毁容的恐怖面孔，“这是什么？”

"Our senses cannot comprehend the Anti-Universe. In response, the LCL has created a virtual reality we can perceive," explained Gendo. "This is the world of your memories. Now, hand over Unit 01 at once. Then, you too will be able to meet your mother again."  
“我们的感官无法理解反宇宙。为此，LCL 创造了我们能感知的虚拟现实，”碇解释道，“这是你的记忆世界。现在，立刻交出初号机。然后，你也能再次见到你的母亲。”

_A place where the sky is blue. Remember to eat and replenish your strength. That's a good cup, Shinji! Well done. How's the idiot tree doing? We might just have peaches this year! You said you wanted to talk. So, talk. I liked you back then. Little by little, step by step.  
一个天空蔚蓝的地方。记得吃饭补充体力。那是个好杯子，真嗣！做得好。那棵傻树怎么样了？今年或许能结桃子呢！你说你想谈谈。那就说吧。那时候我确实喜欢你。一点一点，一步一步。_

Shinji's fist clenched. He was inside the Entry Plug in an instant.  
真嗣的拳头紧握。他瞬间进入了插入栓。

Turning his back on his son, Gendo suppressed the urge to scoff in annoyance. "So you insist on this futile resistance," he muttered. "This is why I dislike children."  
背对着儿子，源渡强压下嗤之以鼻的冲动。“所以你坚持这种无谓的抵抗，”他低声道，“这就是我不喜欢孩子的原因。”

---

"...besides, they do nothing but bitch, moan and complain. What? You asked why I disliked them."  
“……再说了，他们除了抱怨、呻吟和发牢骚什么都不会。怎么？你问为什么我不喜欢他们。”

Misato watched the exchange between blonds. The stranger tried to laugh and coughed out pinkish froth instead. Sakura worked on the wound despite turbulence constantly shaking the wagon, grinding her teeth each time her unwilling patient attempted to move away. Crimson dribbled down the seat and onto the ground, dripping ever so slowly. _It should be my blood._  
美里注视着金发二人组的互动。陌生人试图笑出声，却咳出了粉红色的泡沫。尽管车厢不断颠簸，樱花仍坚持处理伤口，每当她不情愿的病人试图挪开时，她都咬紧牙关。鲜血沿着座位滴落，缓缓渗入地面。本该是我的血。

"Not… that I'm complaining," the stranger replied. He spared the wound a brief glance and produced a bullet. "Ever seen Rambo, doc? Bullet… went right through." Sakura's narrow gaze widened. She shook her head. "Nah, I'll be fine. Been through worse. Give me some of that fire water… of mine," he said, and stifled another cough. "Then pour the gunpowder; it'll cauterize the tissue. Then you can stitch it up without internal bleeding."  
"“不……我不是在抱怨，”陌生男子回答道。他匆匆瞥了一眼伤口，掏出一颗子弹。“医生，看过《第一滴血》吗？子弹……直接穿过去了。”樱的目光变得锐利，她摇了摇头。“没事，我经历过更糟的。给我来点我的烈酒……”他说着，又忍住了一阵咳嗽。“然后撒上火药；可以烧灼组织。这样你就可以缝合，不会内出血了。”

Ritsuko sat to Misato's right and tapped furiously on her set of laptops. Her scowl would have halted a Wanderer in its steps. "Whatever you put in that firewater is working," she ground out, sarcasm heavy on her tone. "The mutineers are losing consciousness. Perfect timing. Right when we needed all hands on deck."  
"律子坐在美里右边，疯狂地敲打着她的笔记本电脑。她的皱眉足以让一个流浪者止步。“你往那烈酒里放的东西起作用了，”她咬牙切齿地说，语气中满是讽刺。“叛乱者们开始昏迷了。正是时候。就在我们需要全员上阵的时候。”

"Yes, well," the man wheezed. "There should be just about enough… _blyat_… to handle the ship."  
"“是的，不过，”男子喘息着说。“应该刚好……妈的……够处理这艘船了。”

"We're under constant attack from these awakened copies," Misato spoke with finality. "It's futile. There has to be a way we can help Shinji."  
"我们正不断遭受这些觉醒副本的攻击，"美里语气决绝，"这样下去毫无希望。我们必须找到帮助真嗣的方法。"

All three women grimaced once the smell of burnt flesh littered the room. The stranger trashed with gritted teeth, his groans barely above a whisper, and eventually settled back on the seat. Maya stitched the edges closed as best she could, bandaging the man's midsection with whatever gauze they could spare.  
三名女性闻到烧焦的肉味弥漫在房间里，都不禁皱起了眉头。陌生人紧咬牙关挣扎着，低沉的呻吟几乎听不见，最终又坐回了椅子上。摩耶尽可能仔细地缝合边缘，用他们能省下的所有纱布包扎了那人的腹部。

"What could Ikari possibly hope to achieve with a Fourth Impact?" Maya wondered aloud.  
"碇司令究竟希望通过第四次冲击达成什么目的？"摩耶不禁自言自语道。

"Simple," replied Ritsuko. "He created a new Spear for this impact, so he wants to bend reality and fulfill a single wish."  
“简单，”律子回答，“他为了这次冲击创造了一支新的长枪，所以他想要扭曲现实，实现一个愿望。”

"Talk about a selfish ass," Kitami grumbled, struggling in vain against her restraints. Her eyelids kept closing. "We're all going to die so he gets his own little nirvana. Bastard."  
“真是自私的混蛋，”北见嘟囔着，徒劳地挣扎着束缚。她的眼皮不断闭合。“我们都要为他的一己之私而死。混账。”

Misato's visage darkened. "This was SEELE's plan. All Ikari did was usurp and alter it to his benefit," she rasped. Her gaze fell on Ritsuko's screen. "Most of utineers are being loaded into the escape pods. Whenever we have an opening, ship them to the village so I can deal with them after this is over."  
美里脸色阴沉。“这是 Seele 的计划。碇源堂只是篡夺并修改它以谋取私利，”她嘶哑地说。目光落在律子的屏幕上。“大部分 utineers 正在被装入逃生舱。一旦有机会，就把他们送到村庄，这样我事后可以处理他们。”

"If we survive, you mean," commented Ritsuko. "Both Evas just jumped into the Anti-Verse, so we're out of reinforcements aside from Mari, whose Eva has taken serious damage already."  
"如果我们能活下来，你是这个意思吧，" 律子评论道。"两台 EVA 刚刚跳进了反宇宙，所以我们除了已经严重受损的真希波的 EVA 外，没有其他增援了。"

The floor and walls shook. Misato wasted no time and sprang on the main deck right after the wagon gates opened. "I refuse to lay on my belly and surrender, and so should all of you," she yelled. The present members nodded, with some screaming out their agreement. "There's still energy left in the engines, and we have a functional Adam spinal column and core! Shinji's out there fighting for us! Let's give him a hand!"  
地板和墙壁摇晃着。美里毫不犹豫，在闸门打开后立刻跳上了主甲板。"我拒绝趴在地上投降，你们也应该如此，"她大喊。在场的人员点头，有些人甚至大声表示同意。"引擎里还有能量，我们有一个功能正常的亚当脊椎和核心！真嗣正在外面为我们战斗！让我们助他一臂之力！"

"Aye!" "好！"

Maya and Ritsuko nodded and assumed battle stations along with the rest. Uncountable Evas continued to slam against the ship's damaged shields, Wanderers flew through the air like rag dolls and congregated in the sizzling form of a gargantuan Lilith. The enemy ships morphed alongside the Second Angel. Despair riddled the air, but was ignored by both captain and crew.  
玛雅和律子点头，与其他人一同进入战斗岗位。无数的 EVA 继续猛烈撞击着受损的舰船护盾，流浪者们如同破布娃娃般在空中飞舞，汇聚成炽热的巨大莉莉丝形态。敌舰与第二使徒一同变形。绝望的气息弥漫在空气中，但无论是舰长还是船员都对此视而不见。

"Heh." Misato heard the stranger force out another chuckle. "You guys are awesome, not giving in a single… inch... even in the face of death. Reminds me of my brothers a little." He coughed and almost fell over with the next turbulence. She held him upright at the last second. "Ryoji would love your attitude."  
“嘿。”米莎听到那个陌生人又勉强笑了一声。“你们真了不起，面对死亡也不退缩……哪怕一寸。让我想起了我的兄弟们。”他咳嗽着，差点在下一阵颠簸中摔倒。她在最后一刻扶住了他。“绪方会喜欢你的态度的。”

_What?_ Misato's mind went blank. The name registered despite the chaos and explosions. "How do you know that name?"  
什么？米莎的思绪一片空白。尽管混乱和爆炸声不断，那个名字还是引起了她的注意。“你怎么知道那个名字？”

"That's your brat's babysitter, Captain," Ritsuko bit out in between commands. "He raised your son for you, of course he'd know."  
“那是你家小鬼的保姆，上尉，”律子在命令间隙咬牙切齿地说，“他替你养大了儿子，当然会知道。”

_Keep her safe, huh? Easier said than done, Puppy!  
保护她，是吧？说起来容易做起来难，小狗！_

Already missing an arm and part of its lower leg, Unit 08 tried to evade the enemy's concentrated attack. The Entry Plug was still securely held in its remaining hand despite the constant blasts assaulting the AT Field. Reality cracked before her, but still Mari pressed on, aware of the Anti-Verse expanding and of Lilith's imminent reincarnation.  
尽管已经失去了一只手臂和部分小腿，08 号机仍试图躲避敌人的集中攻击。驾驶舱依然被它仅存的手紧紧握住，尽管 AT 力场不断受到炮火的冲击。现实在她面前破裂，但真希波依然坚持着，意识到反宇宙的扩张和莉莉丝即将的转生。

"There's really nowhere safe I can leave you, Princess," Mari grumbled. One of the incomplete copies stuck to her shoulder and self-destructed, almost causing her to lose the grip on the precious cargo. Pain threatened to overload her senses. "Guess you're gonna have to hold tight for a while."  
"公主，真的没有安全的地方可以让你待着了。" 玛丽咕哝着。一个未完成的复制体粘在她肩上并自爆了，差点让她失去了对珍贵货物的控制。疼痛几乎要淹没她的感官。"看来你得紧紧抓住一会儿了。"

The Evangelion's neck opened, revealing a second slot for an Entry Plug. Once the screen to Mari's left confirmed Asuka was stabilized, she stopped halting the wrath that nestled within. Unit 08's jaws snapped open, drooling and bleeding, its hand clutched into a fist and grabbed onto the next attacking copy. The Eva's head was sent flying with a viscous punch. The jaws came down around the copy's arm and savagely ripped off one of its arm, feeding on the flesh like a starved beast.

"The Puppy and Vi-kun need some help," Mari growled. Her fangs elongated, her eyes glistened green and her voice turned into a cruel rasp. "You already hurt the Princess and the Puppy enough, Gendo-kun. Code 777."  
"小狗和 Vi-kun 需要帮助，" 玛丽咆哮道。她的牙齿变长，眼睛闪烁着绿光，声音变得冷酷而沙哑。"你已经让公主和小狗受够了伤，Gendo-kun。代码 777。"

Unit 08's AT-Field expanded and easily blocked several blasts from the awakened copies. The lost limbs regenerated in seconds, allowing the rose Evangelion to spring towards the next assailant and devour its core. The more it consumed, the stronger it became, able to channel its power in the shape of a lion and consume entire copies in a single bite.  
08 号机的 AT 力场扩张开来，轻松挡下了觉醒复制体的几轮攻击。失去的肢体在几秒内再生，让这朵玫瑰色的福音战士跃向下一目标，吞噬其核心。它吞噬得越多，力量就越强，甚至能以狮形释放能量，一口吞噬整个复制体。

"Out of my way, flies," Mari growled. The LCL burned around her just as the copies burned to dust when Unit 08's eyes flashed. Shinji had entrusted her with his treasure; there no longer was any margin for error. "Don't you know the definition of perseverance?!"  
“别挡道，小虫子们。”真希波咆哮道。LCL 在她周围燃烧，正如 08 号机眼中闪光时复制体化为灰烬一般。真嗣将他的珍宝托付给了她；再无任何犯错的余地。“你们不知道什么叫坚持吗？！”

---

_A_ _continued effort__to do_ _something_ _despite difficulty or delay in achieving success._  
尽管面临困难或成功延迟，仍持续不懈地努力。

Unit 01 took a defensive position as far as possible from the crouching form of its adversary. Shinji's hands shook whilst grasping the controls. Everything felt fabricated, light and intangible, as though he was caught in a dream. His determination, the stench from the LCL and Rei's presence kept him grounded. He took a cautious step forward.  
初号机尽可能远离蹲伏着的对手，采取防御姿态。真嗣紧握操纵杆的双手颤抖着。一切感觉都像是虚构的，轻盈而不真实，仿佛置身梦中。他的决心、LCL 的气味和绫波的存在让他脚踏实地。他小心翼翼地向前迈了一步。

A strike aimed at his head almost connected, followed by a strike to his neck. His father went for the kill with every single turn of his spear. Every slash or stroke sought to decapitate or skewer him. Evading each deadly movement by mere inches, Shinji planted his feet and retaliated with two overhead attacks, both of which bounced harmlessly off Unit 13's AT-Field.  
一次瞄准头部的攻击几乎命中，紧接着是颈部的一击。他的父亲每次挥动长矛都旨在取他性命。每一道斩击或刺击都试图斩首或刺穿他。真嗣仅以毫厘之差躲过每一次致命动作，稳住脚步，以两次头顶攻击还击，但都被十三号机的 AT 力场无害地弹开。

"Father, please listen to me!" Shinji tried again, only to get kicked in the ribcage and be sent flying into a building. "There has to be a chance to fix all this. Can't we talk?"  
“父亲，请听我说！”真嗣再次尝试，却遭到肋骨处的一脚，被踢飞进一栋建筑。“这一切一定有办法修复。我们不能谈谈吗？”

Miles of empty buildings were turned to ash and glass with the next flicker of Unit 13's eyes. It crouched like a beast and darted towards Shinji, barley missing the Eva's head once again. At first it felt as though Gendo's mecha was too powerful, yet with every strike and parry Shinji noticed a bizarre synchronicity to their exchanges.  
数英里的空旷建筑在 13 号机眼眸的下一闪烁间化为了灰烬与玻璃。它如野兽般蹲伏，疾冲向真嗣，又一次险些击中初号机的头部。起初，真嗣感觉父亲操控的机甲过于强大，但随着每一次攻击与格挡，他察觉到他们交锋中一种奇异的同步性。

Both AT-Fields clashed, shifting the LCL into what he remembered from Misato's apartment. Another strike, and they stood in the sandbox he remembered from nearly a decade before. Unit 01 roared, mimicked to perfection by its adversary, breaking the sandbox like glass and standing before the Geofront instead.  
两者的 AT 力场碰撞，将 LCL 转化为他记忆中来自美里公寓的景象。又一次攻击后，他们站在了他近十年前记忆中的沙盒里。初号机咆哮着，被对手完美模仿，沙盒如同玻璃般破碎，取而代之的是眼前的 Geofront。

Seeing the pyramid worked to rouse Shinji's anger. He recalled Bardiel, the Angel currently coursing through his body, the sensation of crushing the Entry Plug with his very teeth, and remembered how coldly Gendo had reacted to his wrath. _Even if our moves are similar, I'm always a step behind, a bit too slow or too weak,_ he thought. _Don't run away. Persevere, go forward. Take the leap._  
看到金字塔激起了真嗣的愤怒。他回想起巴迪尔，那股此刻流淌在他体内的使徒之力，那种用牙齿碾碎插入栓的感觉，以及源堂对他愤怒的冷漠反应。即使我们的动作相似，我总是慢了一步，稍显迟缓或力不从心，他想。不要逃避。坚持下去，向前迈进。勇敢一跃。

The following clash of spears left both Evas at a standstill. Shinji's sense of individuality started to fade away. "Father, what is happening? Our moves are the same!" He clutched at his head, feeling cold fingers try to grasp at his very soul. "Let me go!"  
随后的长矛碰撞让两台 EVA 陷入了僵持。真嗣的自我意识开始消退。“父亲，这是怎么回事？我们的动作完全一致！”他抱头挣扎，感到冰冷的手指试图攫取他的灵魂。“放开我！”

"Units 01 and 13 are perfect counterparts," growled his father. The Anti-verse condensed around them, almost pushing both Evangelions into one being. "Unit 01 embodies hope. Unit 13, despair. They are synchronized and attuned for each other. This is the last rite of passage I muss pass. Now, give her to me!"  
“初号机和十三号机是完美的对应体，”他的父亲咆哮道。反宇宙的力量在他们周围凝聚，几乎要将两台 EVA 合二为一。“初号机象征希望，十三号机代表绝望。它们彼此同步，相互协调。这是我必须完成的最终仪式。现在，把她交给我！”

Just when he was about to lose all sense of self, Shinji felt the cold touch of the roundel stuck to his side. _I still have to give it back._ "Stop!"  
就在他即将失去所有自我意识之际，真嗣感到侧腹贴着的圆盘传来冰冷的触感。我还得把它还回去。“住手！”

He stumbled back under the onslaught of Unit 13. "It's useless," Gendo said, kicking him miles away. "Your feeble resolve will not stop me. Whatever strength you have acquired thus far is meaningless."  
在 13 号机的猛攻下，他踉跄后退。“没用的，”碇源堂说道，一脚将他踢飞数英里。“你那微弱的决心阻止不了我。无论你迄今为止获得了多少力量，都毫无意义。”

The scenery became familiar when he was next thrown onto a hill. Shinji crashed against Kensuke's home, horrified, then slammed against the ruins where he fished. His next offensive was repelled with little effort and threw him to the village center. Fear and desperation began to flood his senses, so Shinji clutched the roundel and got back to his feet. Unit 01's jaws snapped open.  
当他再次被抛到一座山上时，周围的景色变得熟悉起来。真嗣撞上了剑介的家，惊恐万分，随后又猛地撞上了他曾钓鱼的废墟。他的下一次攻击被轻易击退，将他抛到了村庄中心。恐惧和绝望开始涌上心头，真嗣紧握着圆形徽章，重新站了起来。初号机的下颚猛地张开。

"Stubborn child, you refuse to understand." Unit 13 effortlessly held him by the throat. "Violence is not a way in which this conflict can be resolved. Your strength is too little to even pose a threat."  
“固执的孩子，你还是不懂。”13 号机轻而易举地掐住了他的喉咙。“暴力不是解决这场冲突的途径。你的力量太过微弱，根本构不成威胁。”

_If you ever get the chance, try to talk to him,_ Kensuke reminded him. All around Unit 01 lay the wagons and buildings in which so many new memories lay. The forge, the afternoons working with clay, fishing, speaking with Ryoji, caring for the trees. Toji, Hikari, Rei, Viko. Asuka. If he lost, the trees would not grow. Rei's rice crops would not yield.  
如果有一天你能有机会，试着和他谈谈，真希波提醒他。环绕在初号机周围的是那些载满新记忆的马车和建筑。锻造厂，下午与黏土为伴的时光，钓鱼，与绫人交谈，照料树木。东治，光，丽，维克。明日香。如果他失败了，树木将无法生长。丽的稻田也将颗粒无收。

The spear of Cassius was impaled on the ground. Unit 01 stood, but made no effort to attack. "I want to talk to you, father. I want to try and understand you."  
卡西乌斯之矛插在地上。初号机站立着，却没有发起攻击。“我想和你谈谈，父亲。我想试着理解你。”

"My scenario is beyond your comprehension." Unit 13 mimicked Shinji's movements and stood with the Lance on its side. "But if it will make you cease this irksome resistance, so be it."  
“我的计划超出了你的理解范围。”十三号机模仿着真嗣的动作，持矛而立。“但如果这能让你停止这令人厌烦的抵抗，那就这样吧。”

Shinji's hand slowly relinquished the control yokes. When his eyes reopened, the sepulchral office within the Geofront manifested. Both Evas were gone. "Why," he started. "Why are you doing this, father? What are you trying to accomplish?"  
真嗣的手缓缓松开了操纵杆。当他再次睁开眼睛时，地底都市中的那间阴森办公室映入眼帘。两台 EVA 都已消失无踪。“为什么，”他开口问道，“父亲，你为什么要这么做？你究竟想达成什么目的？”

"A goal which can only be fulfilled here," Gendo replied, hands obscuring half his face. "An additional Impact. It paves the way in which I may slay the gods."  
“一个只能在这里实现的目标，”碇源堂回答，双手遮住了半张脸，“另一次冲击。它为我开辟了弑神之路。”

_Slay them?_ Shinji resisted the urge to gulp_. "_The gods? Adam and Lilith? The… Fruits of life?"  
弑神？真嗣强忍住吞咽的冲动，“神？亚当和莉莉丝？那些……生命之果？”

"Correct." Gendo's hands unwound and produced a hologram of both Evangelions. "For this purpose, I have brought about two spears into this Earth. Every action I have taken till this point has borne fruit at last. Pilot of Unit 01," Gendo stood and walked towards Shinji. "Come. There is something I wish to show you."  
"正确。" 源堂的手松开，随即生成了一幅两台 EVA 的 hologram。"为此目的，我已将两支长矛带入地球。我迄今为止的每一步行动，终于结出了果实。初号机驾驶员，" 源堂站起身，走向真嗣。"过来。我有东西想让你看看。"

The LCL boiled. Central Dogma came to life all around them, while a gigantic cross sprung from the water.  
LCL 沸腾了。中央教条区在他们周围活了过来，而一个巨大的十字架从水中升起。

"Is this…?" Shinji asked. The Angel's skin was as black as coal. "Lilith?"  
"这是……？" 真嗣问道。天使的皮肤如煤炭般漆黑。"莉莉丝？"

"So your memory makes you see her as such," said Gendo. "Doctor Katsuragi predicted the existence of this Angel, one that is imaginary and fictional. Alas, humanity has the ability to believe equally in fantasy and reality, so they too can perceive it."  
"所以你的记忆让你将她视为如此，" 碇源堂说道。"葛城博士预言了这只天使的存在，一个虚构的幻想。然而，人类有能力同样相信幻想与现实，因此他们也能感知到它。"

The spears pierced through the metal walls and began floating before Lilith. A chill went down Shinji's spine, so he forced himself to recall the roundel stuck to his plugsuit. "The final rites," he murmured. "So this is…"  
长矛穿透金属墙壁，开始在莉莉丝面前悬浮。一股寒意沿着真嗣的脊背而下，他强迫自己回想起插在驾驶服上的圆盘。"终焉之仪，" 他喃喃自语。"这就是…"

"Correct. The spears representing despair and hope become each other's trigger." Both weapons unwound and became one. "Imagination and reality blend together." The weapon dug into Lilith's flesh, turning the creature's hue to a haunting white that easily slithered out of the nails holding it to the cross. "All information is homogenized, and thus begins _my_ Impact. This process will rewrite not only our cognition, but the entire world, as well."  
"没错。代表绝望与希望的长矛互为触发。" 两把武器解体并合二为一。"想象与现实融为一体。" 武器刺入莉莉丝的肉体，使这生物的色调变为令人毛骨悚然的白色，轻易地从钉住它的十字架上滑脱。"所有信息被同化，我的冲击就此开始。这一过程将重写我们的认知，乃至整个世界。"

Gendo stretched his arms, as though welcoming the Angel back to life. "This is the only way my wish can be granted."  
源度伸展双臂，仿佛在欢迎使徒重生。“这是实现我愿望的唯一途径。”

_A cigarette.  一支香烟。_

Ritsuko marched ahead, with Misato, Maya, Sakura and Viko in tow. Her fellow blond had stopped bleeding, but was still heavily injured and had to be half-carried by Sakura. _Is that such a magnanimous wish to ask?_ _One that's_ _fresh, unspoiled_ _and not_ _moldy or moist. Just one._ _The world is truly about to end, and all I have is this old, disgusting spine to work with, and an old, disgusting cigarette to end it all._  
律子大步走在前面，身后跟着美里、真希波、樱和维克。她的金发同伴已经不再流血，但伤势依然严重，不得不由樱半扶着。这样的愿望算得上慷慨吗？一个新鲜、未被玷污、不发霉也不潮湿的愿望。仅仅一个。世界真的即将终结，而我所能依靠的只有这根陈旧、令人作呕的脊梁，以及一根陈旧、令人作呕的香烟来结束一切。

The gate into the Anti-verse widened, and her readings began going haywire. Wanderers continued to fly towards the Second Angel, whose visage was a sickening mockery of Rei Ayanami. _A delightful souvenir for the mutineers,_ she thought. _The ones that are somewhat conscious, at least._  
通往反宇宙的门扉扩大，她的读数开始乱套。流浪者们继续飞向第二使徒，其面容是对绫波丽的令人作呕的嘲弄。她想，这对叛乱者来说是个令人愉快的纪念品。至少那些还有些意识的人。

"H-Horrible," whispered Sakura with dread. "This is insane."  
“太可怕了，”樱带着恐惧低语，“这太疯狂了。”

"Not nearly as horrible as it's likely to get. Ikari will exhaust both spears to get his wish," Ritsuko grumbled.  
"“还没到最糟糕的时候。碇会耗尽两把长矛来实现他的愿望，”律子咕哝道。”

"Once they're all gone, Shinji won't be able to stop the Impact, no matter how much he tries." said Misato. Ritsuko saw the Captain's eyes travel repeatedly to Viko. "Shinji needs our help. We'll make a new spear and deliver it to him."  
"一旦他们都消失了，无论真嗣怎么努力，也无法阻止冲击。" 美里说道。律子看到舰长的目光反复投向维克托。"真嗣需要我们的帮助。我们将制造一支新矛并交给他。"

"Heh, that sounds fun," Viko rasped from behind. "How do you plan to do that, Captain?"  
"嘿，听起来挺有意思的，" 维克托在背后嘶哑地说道。"你打算怎么做，舰长？"

"Ikari used the ships to create spears and orchestrate this scenario of his," Misato replied, signaling to the bones at their side. "There must be a way we can do the same with the WUNDER. This ship is imbued with humanity's will. There are many depending on us, so we have to manufacture another miracle." She pointed at her eldest friend. "I believe in Ritsuko's intelligence, I believe in the power of WILLE, in our crew, and in Shinji."  
"碇利用这些船只制造矛并策划了这一切，" 美里回答，示意着他们身旁的残骸。"我们一定可以用 WUNDER 做到同样的事情。这艘船承载着人类的意志。有许多人依赖我们，所以我们必须再创造一个奇迹。" 她指向她最年长的朋友。"我相信律子的智慧，我相信 WILLE 的力量，相信我们的船员，也相信真嗣。"

"Reckless as usual," Ritsuko muttered, and rolled her eyes. "All we have are the data samples we collected a few seconds ago."  
"一如既往地鲁莽，" 律子低声嘀咕，翻了个白眼。"我们只有几秒钟前收集的数据样本。"

"More than enough for you," Misato interjected with a confident smile. "Care to give it a shot?"  
"对你来说足够了，" 美里自信地笑着插话。"想试试吗？"

"Eh, not like I have much of a choice," she responded. Her gaze fell on Maya. "Sorry, we'll just have to wing it."  
"呃，我也没什么选择，" 她回答道。目光落在玛雅身上。"抱歉，我们只能随机应变了。"

"No problem, Senpai." Maya said, smiling. "Isn't that what we always do, anyway?"  
"没问题，前辈。" 真希波笑着说，"反正我们不一直都是这样做的吗？"

The reached the spine's chamber expecting it to be dark and abandoned. Ritsuko herself was a bit taken aback by the many crewmen working to disengage the bones. _Leave it to these idiots,_ she thought, shaking her head.  
他们到达了脊柱室，以为这里会是一片黑暗和废弃。赤木律子本人也对许多船员正在努力解开骨架的情景感到有些意外。她摇了摇头，心想，这些家伙真是无可救药。

"What are you lot doing here?" Misato yelled from the stand. "I told you to evacuate this part of the ship! Just being near that thing is dangerous!"  
"你们这帮人在这里干什么？" 美里从看台上喊道，"我告诉过你们要撤离这艘船的这一部分！靠近那东西本身就是危险的！"

"Last duty, Captain!" Aoba yelled as he hung from the ceiling.  
"最后一项任务，舰长！" 青叶挂在天花板上大喊。

"We're not gonna let you get all the glory, Ritsuko-senpai!"  
"我们可不会让你独享荣耀，律子前辈！"

"We'll do what we can!"  
"我们会尽力而为！"

"Little by little!" "一点点来！"

"Heh, lots of good people in here," rasped Viko. He coughed into his hand to hide the red sprinkles, but Ritsuko saw them regardless. "We're gonna need… good people like you in the village… after this is over."  
"嘿，这里有很多好人，""维科沙哑地说道。他用手捂住嘴咳嗽，试图掩盖那些红色的斑点，但无论如何，律子还是看到了。""我们需要……像你这样的好人……在这一切结束后，留在村子里。"

"What are you still doing here? You should have evacuated with the rest!" Misato snapped, pointing towards the man's wound. "You're dead weight at this point!"  
"你还在这里做什么？你应该和其他人一起撤离！""美里厉声说道，指向那人的伤口。""你现在只是个累赘！"

"Eh, he might be useful in something." Ritsuko placed a hand on the Captain's shoulder and smirked. "We have to hurry getting Shinji some help. Ikari's bound to do something even crazier soon."  
“呃，他可能在某些方面有用。”律子将手放在舰长的肩膀上，微微一笑。“我们得赶紧给真嗣找些帮助。碇司令肯定会做出更疯狂的事。”

---

"Crazier than this? Unlikely."  
“比这还疯狂？不太可能。”

Kozo sighed in dejection upon hearing the familiar voice ring inside his head. "Of course. Reality is breaking, the imaginary and the tangible are intermingling." He turned, slightly satisfied to see no smug bespectacled girl smirking. "I suppose this concludes the festivities."  
当听到那熟悉的声音在脑海中响起时，Kozo 沮丧地叹了口气。“当然。现实正在崩溃，虚幻与真实正在交织。”他转过身，略感满意地发现并没有那个戴着眼镜、面带得意笑容的女孩。“我想这宣告了庆典的结束。”

"You're getting awful close to the epicenter, Fuyu-kun," Mari's voice whispered in his head. "I'm a little busy at the moment, so I can't afford to fish you out."  
"你离震中越来越近了，冬君，" 麻里在他的脑海中低语，"我现在有点忙，可没空把你捞出来。"

With a shrug, Kozo turned back to Lilith. "This vessel was never meant to be manned. I know I'm being reckless." He sighed again. "You run a tight shift, Miss Makinami."  
耸了耸肩，耕助转向莉莉丝，"这艘船原本就不是用来载人的。我知道我这样做很鲁莽。" 他又叹了口气，"真是个严苛的班次，真希波小姐。"

"I can somewhat sympathize with you trying to help your pupil, or more accurately." He felt the woman smirk. "How your wish overlaps with his. Out of my way! Precious cargo, coming through!" Explosions shook the ship, signaling Mari was close. "I'd appreciate if you don't drag along all of humanity along, though. I have plans for _at least_ two of them!"  
"我多少能理解你想帮助你的学生，或者更确切地说，" 他感觉到那女人在笑，"你的愿望和他的重叠。让开！珍贵的货物来了！" 爆炸震撼着船体，表明麻里已经很近了。"不过，我希望你不要把全人类都拖下水。我至少还有两个人的计划！"

_Ah, the almighty scenario._ "Humanity always relies on that ray of light called hope. Perhaps too much, to the point where it can be a disease," said Kozo. "Perhaps both my foolish student and I have clung to it for far too long."  
啊，那无所不能的剧本。“人类总是依赖那束名为希望的光芒。或许依赖得太过，以至于它成了一种病，”Kozo 说道，“也许我和我那愚蠢的学生都紧紧抓住它太久了。”

"Sorry to tell you, professor, but that wasn't hope." The ship shook again. He heard Unit 08's footfalls from the deck. "Hope looks different than despair, for one."  
“很抱歉告诉您，教授，但那不是希望。”船再次摇晃起来。他听到 Unit 08 在甲板上的脚步声。“希望与绝望不同，至少这一点是不同的。”

"Does it? No matter." Fuyutsuki's gaze softened. Shinji crossed his thoughts for a moment. "I have assembled the items you required. Do as you wish, Mari Iscariot."  
“是吗？无所谓了。”Fuyutsuki 的目光柔和下来。Shinji 的思绪短暂地交错了一瞬。“我已经准备好了您需要的物品。Mari Iscariot，您随意使用吧。”

"Now that's a name I haven't heard in a while. Thanks for the help, Fuyu-kun!" The ship's left wing exploded. He felt the girl's animalistic gaze soften. "I can still get you out, you know."  
"那是个久违的名字了。谢谢你的帮助，冬君！" 飞船的左翼爆炸了。他感觉到女孩野性的目光柔和了下来。"我还能带你出去，你知道的。"

"I appreciate the sentiment, but no." He produced the old picture, his faithful companion for so many years. The deck then was shrouded in darkness, signaling the engine had malfunctioned. "Her wish may not be our wish, Gendo."  
"我感激这份心意，但不必了。" 他拿出了那张旧照片，多年来一直忠实的伙伴。甲板随即被黑暗笼罩，表明引擎出了故障。"她的愿望未必是我们的愿望，源堂。"

A passing thought invaded his tired brain a second before the pressure reduced his body to LCL. Somewhere out there in the Anti-verse, Shinji was still trying to understand his father. Kozo Fuyutsuki died with a peaceful smile on his face.  
一个念头在他疲惫的大脑中闪过，紧接着压力将他的身体化为了 LCL。在反宇宙的某个地方，真嗣仍在试图理解他的父亲。冬月耕造带着平静的微笑离世了。

_I wonder. Was this your wish, Yui?  
我在想，这是你的愿望吗，唯？_

---

"Guess it won't come true, then."  
“看来是不会实现了。”

Producing the picture Toji had sent was almost as painful as being spiteful towards Shinji had been. In a distant world fourteen years before, she had asked for one simple thing. Holding her child close had felt so attainable and yet, so impossible at once. Many times the opportunity had presented itself, many times she had ignored it. Now, with the world about to end and the barrier around Village-1 barely holding, Misato realized she would never see her son again.  
拿出冬二寄来的照片，几乎和向真嗣发泄怨气一样痛苦。在十四年前的一个遥远世界里，她曾请求一件简单的事情。抱着自己的孩子，感觉既触手可及，又遥不可及。许多次机会摆在面前，许多次她都视而不见。如今，世界即将终结，第 1 村周围的屏障勉强支撑，美里意识到她再也见不到自己的儿子了。

"What won't?" Ritsuko barked from across the room. "All right, the spinal alignment is set. Time to evacuate, everyone! Priority to the wounded and the young!"  
"什么不会？" 律子在房间另一头厉声问道。"好了，脊椎对齐已完成。所有人立即撤离！优先照顾伤员和年轻人！"

"Get to the escape pods at once!" Misato added. "This is your captain's last command aboard the WUNDER. Survive, all of you. I forbid you to die."  
"立刻前往逃生舱！" 美里补充道。"这是你们船长在 WUNDER 上的最后命令。你们都要活下去。我不允许你们任何人死去。"

"Roger!" came the massive response from the remaining crew members.  
"明白！" 剩余的船员们齐声回应道。"

"Transfer the controls to the main deck," she told the doctor. "All of them. It should be easy enough to jam the rudder in a single direction."  
"将控制权转交给主甲板，"她对医生说。"所有的控制权。把舵固定在一个方向应该不难。"

"As the Captain commands." Ritsuko turned back, eyes narrowing. "Did you… wasn't Viko around here. Somewhere?"  
"遵从舰长命令。"赤木律子转过身，眼神变得锐利。"你……维克不在这里吗？在某个地方？"

"He was helping set the last bones in place, but I dispatched him to the pods," Maya replied. "One of the last explosions reopened the wound."  
"他在帮忙固定最后一根骨头，但我派他去了逃生舱，"真希波回答。"其中一次爆炸又让伤口裂开了。"

_Good riddance_._The last thing I want is hearing him ramble on about my son as I fly to my death. Speaking of which._ "Time to head to the escape pods," said Misato. "We've run out of time, the pillars in the Village are about to give out."  
终于解脱了。我最不想的就是在我赴死之际，还听他喋喋不休地谈论我儿子。说到这个。“该去逃生舱了。”美里说道，“我们没时间了，村里的柱子快要撑不住了。”

"Lead the way, then." Ritsuko's gaze narrowed even further after Misato made no effort to run. Maya and Sakura evacuated, but waited by the corner. "I already set the course and jammed the rudder. The crew still needs a captain."  
“那你带路吧。”律子目光更加锐利，因为美里丝毫没有奔跑的意思。真希波和樱已经撤离，但等在拐角处。“我已经设定好航线并锁死了舵。船员们还需要一个船长。”

"Half the crew is apparently against me, but that's not an issue," she replied with a sad smile. "You know the self-navigation tends to fail. Somebody needs to stay behind to make sure we don't miss. There's only one chance at this."  
“显然有一半船员反对我，但这不是问题，”她带着苦笑回答，“你知道自动驾驶容易出故障。需要有人留下来确保我们不会错过。这只有一次机会。”

"You're being ridiculous. The steering is jammed, there's no need to be a stupid her-"  
"你真是太荒唐了。方向盘卡住了，没必要像个愚蠢的——"

Misato's hand fell heavily on her friend's shoulder, squeezing with vehemence. "Look after the young ones for me, will you?" she interrupted. It was near impossible to hold back tears. "Please."  
美里重重地把手放在朋友的肩上，用力握紧。“帮我照顾好孩子们，好吗？”她打断道。泪水几乎要夺眶而出。“求你了。”

"I understand." Ritsuko said with a nod. "I'll do my best. No promises, though. I hate brats."  
"我明白。" 律子点头说道。"我会尽力的。不过，不保证什么。我讨厌小孩。"

"Yeah, I know." "是啊，我知道。"

She noticed the shock on Ritsuko's face too late. An arm snaked around her neck too quickly for Misato to react. Ungodly pressure cut off her flow of oxygen, and in a manner of seconds her vision blurred. She flailed, tried to elbow the man around his damaged midsection, to no avail. Her old friend made no effort to free her from the hold, neither did Maya or Sakura.  
她注意到律子脸上的震惊已经太迟了。一条手臂迅速绕过她的脖子，快到美里来不及反应。难以承受的压力切断了她的氧气供应，几秒钟内她的视线就开始模糊。她挣扎着，试图用肘部攻击那人受伤的腹部，但无济于事。她的老朋友没有试图从束缚中解救她，真希波和樱也没有。

"Nothing personal, Captain," she heard the stranger whisper before everything went black. "But I made a promise to your son, and I'm a man of my word."  
"这不是针对你个人，上尉，"她听到那个陌生人低语，随后一切陷入黑暗。"但我向你的儿子许下了承诺，我是个守信的人。"

---

Ritsuko's detached gaze was certainly something he had not missed. The bullet hole stung worse with every deep breath; blood was slow but steadily making its way down his leg. _Nothing ever impresses the good doctor, eh? Good thing I came prepared._  
律子那冷漠的目光确实是他未曾忽视的。子弹孔随着每一次深呼吸而刺痛加剧；血缓慢但稳定地沿着他的腿流下。这位好医生果然什么都不为所动，是吧？幸好我有备而来。

"Overly dramatic and time-consuming, this charade of yours," she told Viko. Maya and Sakura hurried away, carrying the unconscious Misato with them. "Are we done here, V.K?"  
“过于戏剧化且耗时，你这出戏，”她对维科说。真希和樱急忙带着昏迷的美里离开。“我们这里完事了吗，V.K？”

"Not… quite," he replied, stifling a cough, and produced a cigarette from his pocket. "Man of my word."  
“还没…完全结束，”他回答，强忍着咳嗽，从口袋里掏出一支烟。“我是个守信的人。”

Watching honest surprise shine on the scientist's face was almost as rewarding as a tree's first harvest. Viko grinned once Ritsuko's shaking fingers retrieved the result of years worth of labor and research. Despite the now headless feminine giants dancing outside the ship, she only had eyes for the small gift.  
看到科学家脸上闪现的真诚惊讶，几乎如同树木首次收获般令人满足。当 Ritsuko 颤抖的手指取出这数年劳动与研究的成果时，Viko 露出了笑容。尽管此刻无头的女性巨人在船外舞动，她的眼中却只有这份小小的礼物。

"How… what? These are extinct. Tobacco doesn't grow well in Japan, especially in the village," she said, incredulous. "There's no greenhouse on earth where you could have done this."  
“怎么……什么？这些已经灭绝了。烟草在日本，尤其是在村庄里，生长得并不好，”她难以置信地说，“地球上没有任何温室能让你做到这一点。”

"There are no… impossible things," he repeated Mari's words one last time. Ritsuko shook her head and handed him her PDA. Viko took a long, painful breath. "Thanks for everything, doctor. Tell miss Misato she has a wonderful son. Please make sure she spends time with him."  
“没有……不可能的事情，”他最后一次重复了 Mari 的话。Ritsuko 摇了摇头，将她的 PDA 递给他。Viko 深吸了一口气，感到一阵痛楚。“感谢你所做的一切，医生。告诉 Misato 小姐，她有一个出色的儿子。请确保她能花时间陪伴他。”

"Eh, if we survive I'll handcuff them by the wrist until they act like mother and son, how's that?" Ritsuko asked with her back turned. "Are you gonna tell me your name, now?"  
"哎，如果我们能活下来，我就用手铐把他们铐在一起，直到他们表现得像母子一样，怎么样？" 律子背对着问道。"你现在愿意告诉我你的名字了吗？"

"Nope. My brother told me not to tell." He placed a bloodied finger on his lip. "Farewell, doctor."  
"不行。我哥哥告诉我不要说。" 他用沾血的手指按在唇上。"再见了，医生。"

The woman's figure jumped in an out of focus as she walked away. It took all of Viko's concentration to find his way through the maze of corridors and get to the main deck. He drunkenly entered the lock in code and wobbled to the mast. The controls came to life on the nearest mainframes. A massive red eye glared up ahead, with the dancing Wanderers circling the entrance to the Anti-Verse and blocking the way.  
那女人的身影时隐时现，她走远了。维科费尽全力才穿过迷宫般的走廊，抵达主甲板。他醉醺醺地输入密码进入舱门，摇摇晃晃地走向桅杆。附近的控制台亮了起来。前方，一只巨大的红眼瞪视着，游荡者们在反宇宙入口周围舞动，挡住了去路。

"Okay, just like… riding a bike, right?" Viko asked. _Position the target in the center, pull the switch._ The blood loss was taking its toll; his brother's voice was clearer than it had been in years. _S__ure, but this thing says we're low on EM power, whatever that is,_ he replied.  
"“好吧，就像……骑自行车一样，对吧？”维科问道。将目标置于中心，拉动开关。失血正在产生影响；他哥哥的声音比过去几年都要清晰。当然，但这东西显示我们电磁能量不足，管它是什么呢，他回答道。”

_If all else fails, Vasya, press the big red button and hope for_ _t__he best. Ah, remember to smile in the end. Very important, disarms your opponent._  
"“如果一切都失败了，瓦西亚，按下那个大红按钮，然后期待最好的结果。啊，记得最后要微笑。非常重要，能解除对手的武装。”

_IGNITION  点火_

"Well, that's comprehensive," he said, and did as his brother instructed. The initial thrust from the engines undid whatever remained of the stitches, blinding Viko with momentary agony. "How did that VTOL work, again? Uh, let's see."  
“嗯，真是全面，”他说着，按照哥哥的指示行事。引擎的初次推进撕裂了剩余的缝线，瞬间的剧痛让维科眼前一黑。“那垂直起降是怎么操作的来着？呃，让我看看。”

Viko scratched the top of his head whilst the vessel flew headfirst into the abyss. He started pushing buttons and playing with the display out to slight desperation until a tune started blasting through the speakers. Something landed atop the WUNDER's deck with enough force to shake the entire ship. Viko grinned.  
维科挠了挠头顶，而飞船正一头扎进深渊。他开始有些绝望地按动按钮，摆弄显示屏，直到一阵旋律从扬声器中爆发出来。有什么东西重重地落在了 WUNDER 的甲板上，整艘船都为之震动。维科咧嘴一笑。

"Miss Mari," he rasped. "Glad to have you back."  
“玛丽小姐，”他嘶哑地说道，“很高兴你回来了。”

"_You'__re a right little whelp, aren't you__!__?_ _I told you to evacuate!"_ Mari screamed through the comm, only to chuckle afterwards. _"You and your promises. We're_ _too_ _close_ _t__o Gendo-kun and the Puppy. There's no going b__a__ck from this, Vi-kun."_  
"你真是个小捣蛋鬼，不是吗！？我告诉过你要撤离！" 玛丽通过通讯器尖叫道，随后轻声笑了起来。"你和你那些承诺。我们离源堂君和小狗太近了。已经没有回头路了，维君。"

"It's fine." He whispered. "Ryoji knows how to care for the crops and survive." His eyes caressed the picture Misato had set by the control booth, one depicting both Ryoji and Shinji. "Hey, Miss Mari. What would you wish for, if you were in Mr. Gendo's position?"  
"没关系。" 他低声说。"阿光知道如何照顾庄稼和生存。" 他的目光抚摸着 Misato 放在控制台旁的照片，照片上阿光和真嗣并肩而立。"嘿，玛丽小姐。如果你处在源堂先生的位置，你会希望什么？"

---

"A world where there are no AT-Fields."  
"一个没有 AT 力场的世界。"

The blood ocean stretched endlessly, and in it, his father lay. Through the LCL Shinji felt his emotion. Grief, anger, confusion, denial. Hope. Fear. So many of them resonated within his own chest, ached with such painful familiarity. The heaviest one, loneliness, overflowed through the waves and out of Gendo like a pulsating wound.  
血海无边无际，而他的父亲就躺在其中。通过 LCL，真嗣感受到了他的情感。悲伤、愤怒、困惑、否认。希望。恐惧。如此多的情感在他自己的胸中回响，带着熟悉的痛楚。最沉重的那种，孤独，随着波浪涌出，如同跳动的伤口般从源堂身上溢出。

"The world I refused?" Shinji asked, forcing himself not to flinch when Kaworu's death flashed in his mind.  
“我拒绝的世界？”真嗣问道，强迫自己不要在脑海中闪现渚薰死亡的画面时退缩。

"Correct," Gendo carried on. "A world where humanity shares one heart, one soul. A world without barriers, discrimination, sorrow, pain or abuse. A peaceful world in which I can be with Yui again. Forever."  
“没错，”源堂继续说道，“一个全人类共享一颗心、一个灵魂的世界。一个没有隔阂、歧视、悲伤、痛苦或虐待的世界。一个我可以永远与唯在一起的和平世界。”

_Yui? M__y_ _mother's name. Mother._  
Yui？我母亲的名字。母亲。

Memories that were not his own manifested in Shinji's mind whilst despair bled from Gendo's voice. He saw her at last, the shadow that roamed in the back of his dreams, always shrouded in fog. Shinji saw his mother's face through the eyes of his father.  
不属于他自己的记忆在真嗣的脑海中显现，而绝望从源堂的声音中渗出。他终于看到了她，那个总是在他梦境深处被迷雾笼罩的影子。真嗣透过父亲的眼睛看到了母亲的容颜。

"Yui," Gendo called out. For once, he heard the man's voice quiver. "Yui! Where are you? Come back!"  
“Yui，”源堂呼唤着。这一次，他听到了那个男人的声音在颤抖。“Yui！你在哪里？回来吧！”

Endless nights plotting, years upon years of defying the gods and sacrificing every shred of his humanity, decades of masking the suffering with determination, and false hope. Shinji saw it written in Gendo's soul; he had exhausted all other means to save his mother. Attachment and fondness tugged at Shinji's heart with every memory.  
无尽的夜晚策划着，年复一年地违抗神明，牺牲掉他所有的人性，数十年来用决心和虚假的希望掩盖痛苦。真嗣在源堂的灵魂中看到了这一切；他已经用尽了所有其他方法来拯救他的母亲。每一份记忆都牵动着真嗣的心，让他感受到那份依恋和喜爱。

Yui Ikari was in Unit 01. Despite the many salvage attempts and placing the Evangelion in the center of an Impact, her soul remained locked in the core. Even to him, Unit 01's pilot, her presence was faint, distant as she was in his dreams. However, she was lively in Gendo's thoughts, happy and smiling in almost each recollection. _There are things one mustn't throw away,_ Shinji mused. Understanding dawned, followed by sorrow. _You got rid of everything but her memories._ _This is… your treasure._  
碇唯就在 01 号机里。尽管多次尝试回收，并将 EVA 置于冲击的中心，她的灵魂仍被锁在核心中。即使对他，01 号机的驾驶员来说，她的存在也是模糊而遥远的，就像在梦中一样。然而，在源堂的思绪中，她却是鲜活的，几乎每一次回忆中都带着快乐和微笑。有些东西是不应该抛弃的，真嗣沉思着。理解涌上心头，随之而来的是悲伤。你抛弃了一切，只留下了她的记忆。这就是……你的宝藏。

The more he delved into his father's life, the easier it was to see he similarities. The feeling of isolation, of being completely alone and dragging his feet to exist another day, and the sudden intrusion of life and light into his gloomy existence. Music blasted in his ear, familiar tunes he knew too well rewound and played in a loop, until they stopped. He heard the chords to track 29 and saw his mother remove Gendo's headphones. Grey shifted to a myriad of colors neither had bothered to look on before.  
他越是深入探究父亲的生活，就越容易发现相似之处。那种孤立无援的感觉，完全孤独地拖着脚步再活一天，以及生命和光明突然闯入他阴郁的存在。音乐在他耳边轰鸣，那些他再熟悉不过的旋律一遍遍倒带播放，直到停止。他听到了第 29 轨的和弦，看到母亲摘下了碇的耳机。灰色变成了他们之前都未曾留意的五彩斑斓。

'Yui Ikari' '碇唯'

They stood before the empty grave of his mother next. "For years, I also avoided you," Shinji admitted. "Even if I was lonely, I was afraid to know if you disliked me or not. But… I think I'm ready, now."  
他们站在母亲空荡荡的墓前。“多年来，我也一直在回避你，”真嗣坦白道，“即使我感到孤独，也害怕知道你是否讨厌我。但是……我想我现在已经准备好了。”

_Eat.  吃。_

Rain falling on the roof replaced the SDAT's lulling song. The smell of wet soil, the smiles of the villagers before work. Fresh ingredients given away with a smirk, a warm jacket over his shoulders, a comfortable cap on his head. Rei, caring for the trees and working with clay. A hand on his hair, scratching at his scalp. Red locks tickling his face. Had he not been ready to destroy he world in order to save Rei? Ha Asuka been taken like his father intended, would he not be willing to be the center of Instrumentality, as well?  
雨滴敲打屋顶，取代了 SDAT 的催眠曲。湿润泥土的气息，村民们工作前的微笑。带着戏谑赠送的新鲜食材，披在肩上的温暖夹克，头上舒适的帽子。丽，照料树木，与泥土共舞。一只手抚过他的头发，轻挠头皮。红色的发丝轻拂脸颊。他难道不是已经准备好毁灭世界以拯救丽吗？如果明日香像他父亲计划的那样被带走，他难道不愿意成为人类补完计划的中心吗？

How far was he willing to go in order to save all he had learned to cherish?  
为了拯救他所学会珍视的一切，他愿意走多远？

The memories dissolved. It was almost ironic how both their minds went back to the train, to the place they felt most isolated, despite being surrounded by others. Invisible to the world, too insignificant to waste a kind word or a caring gesture on, too caught up in their own hand-crafted prisons to even acknowledge if anybody bothered to. Shinji's fingers tightened around the SDAT. They sat across from each other, with his father's visage resembling the man Shinji remembered, and not he monster he had become.  
记忆消散了。颇具讽刺意味的是，他们的思绪都回到了那列火车上，回到了那个他们感到最孤独的地方，尽管周围都是人。在这个世界上，他们是隐形的，微不足道，不值得浪费一句善意的话语或一个关怀的举动，他们深陷在自己打造的牢笼中，甚至无暇顾及是否有人在意。真嗣的手指紧紧握住 SDAT。他们面对面坐着，他父亲的容貌像真嗣记忆中的那个人，而不是他变成的怪物。

"Father," Shinji said. His father sat across from him. "You were just like me."  
“父亲，”真嗣说。他的父亲坐在他对面。“你曾经和我一样。”

"Yes," Gendo replied. "I was. Headphones cut me off from the outside world. They protected me from the noise of others, they helped me feign indifference. Yui changed that; after I met her… I no longer needed them." He leaned back, sighing. "I never knew a parent's love, and yet became one at Yui's beckoning." His expression darkened behind the glasses. "This world is unstable, irrational. Imperfect. It preys on your desires and good intentions, and deprives you of truth or purpose."  
“是的，”碇源堂回答。“我曾经是。耳机将我与外界隔绝。它们保护我免受他人的喧嚣，帮助我假装冷漠。唯改变了这一切；遇见她之后……我不再需要它们了。”他向后靠，叹了口气。“我从未体验过父母的爱，却在唯的召唤下成为了一位父亲。”他的表情在眼镜后变得阴沉。“这个世界是不稳定的，非理性的。不完美的。它利用你的欲望和善意，剥夺你的真理或目的。”

It was strange yet heartwarming for Shinji to see his father display humanity. "Were you lonely?" he asked.  
对真嗣来说，看到父亲展现出人性的一面既奇怪又暖心。“你感到孤独吗？”他问道。

"No." Gendo pushed back his glasses. "I was alone since childhood, so I never truly felt loneliness. I feared… creating bonds with others. A world brimming with such bonds… displeased me. I hated going to people's houses, relatives or classmates I did not care about. Being forced to partake in their lives was excruciatingly torturous." His voice quieted. "I simply wanted to be alone, always."  
“不。”源堂推了推眼镜。“我从小就是一个人，所以从未真正感到过孤独。我害怕……与他人建立联系。一个充满这种联系的世界……让我不悦。我讨厌去那些人的家里，那些我不在乎的亲戚或同学。被迫参与他们的生活是极其痛苦的折磨。”他的声音低了下来。“我只想永远独自一人。”

Shinji nodded. "When you were young," he started. "What were things that you liked?"  
真嗣点点头。“你小时候，”他开口道，“你喜欢什么？”

"Only two things," the man responded. "Knowledge. I could satiate my starving heart by gorging on information on my own terms. There was no need to concern myself with others. The other was the piano."  
"只有两样东西，" 那人回答道。"知识。我可以按照自己的条件，通过大量吸收信息来满足我那饥饿的心灵。无需关心他人。另一样是钢琴。"

The cello case flashed in Shinji's mind. Passion bled into the LCL; the sensation of giving oneself completely to a piece and forgetting reality for a few precious seconds. "Music."  
大提琴箱在真嗣的脑海中闪现。热情融入 LCL 中；那种完全沉浸在乐曲中，忘记现实片刻的珍贵感觉。"音乐。"

"Correct. A finely tuned wire would respond accordingly when the key was played. There was no deception, no betrayal or disappointment. My existence flowed seamlessly along with the tunes. I like being alone; neither I or anyone else would get hurt that way. Alone, I could be at ease."  
"没错。一根调好的琴弦会在弹奏键时做出相应的反应。没有欺骗，没有背叛或失望。我的存在与旋律无缝流动。我喜欢独处；这样我和任何人都不会受到伤害。独自一人，我可以自在安然。"

"But then you met Mother." Shinji's lips quirked upwards.  
"但后来你遇到了母亲。" 真嗣的嘴角微微上扬。

Gendo Ikari smiled for the first time in decades. "Who knew life could be an enjoyable experience? Yui alone accepted me for who I was." Agony clouded his features. "After I lost her, I was unable to live alone, anymore. I was drowned in the anguish of loneliness." His voice quieted further, and his shoulders slackened. "I just wanted to cry in her arms, improve myself by simply being at her side. I just wanted that wish… to be true."  
碇源堂几十年来第一次露出微笑。"谁知道生活可以是一种愉快的体验？只有唯接受了我本来的样子。"痛苦笼罩着他的面容。"失去她之后，我再也无法独自生活。我被孤独的痛苦淹没了。"他的声音越来越低，肩膀也松弛下来。"我只想在她怀里哭泣，仅仅在她身边就能自我提升。我只希望那个愿望……能成真。"

_Rei,_ Shinji thought. Sadness gripped at his soul. _How many of your sisters were sacrificed for this wish?_  
真嗣想到了绫波。悲伤紧紧抓住了他的灵魂。为了这个愿望，有多少你的姐妹被牺牲了？

"And do you think this would be Mother's wish, as well?"  
"你认为这也是母亲的愿望吗？"

"I… do not know." Gendo replied, and placed his head in his hands. "I am forbidden… from seeing Yui ever again. That is why… I must see the scenario through."  
"我……不知道。" 源度回答，双手抱头。"我被禁止……再见到唯。这就是为什么……我必须将这个计划进行到底。"

The train came to a grinding halt.  
列车嘎吱一声停了下来。

Shinji felt the shift in the LCL. "Father, please," he tried, pushing the SDAT forward. "You have to stop this."  
真嗣感觉到 LCL 中的变化。“父亲，请您，”他尝试着，将 SDAT 递上前。“您必须停止这一切。”

An AT-Field manifested, dividing them both. "What?" Gendo stepped back in surprise. "But I gave up my humanity."  
AT 力场显现，将他们隔开。“什么？”碇源堂后退一步，惊讶道。“但我已经放弃了人性。”

"I know you wanted to get rid of everything, but this wasn't something meant to be thrown away," said Shinji. He easily pierced the shield, and offered the music box with a smile. "It was something meant to be given back to you. Let's stop this, father. We still can. Together."  
“我知道你想要抛弃一切，但这个不是应该被丢弃的东西，”真嗣说。他轻易地穿透了屏障，微笑着递上音乐盒。“这是应该归还给你的东西。让我们停止这一切吧，父亲。我们仍然可以。一起。”

Gendo's hand tentatively reached forward. For a moment, there was perfect synchronicity between father and son.  
源堂的手试探性地伸向前方。那一刻，父子之间达到了完美的同步。

Just when Shinji was about to relinquish the SDAT, Gendo's hand closed around his wrist like a vice. Bardiel shrieked in dread. "I'm sorry, Shinji," he said. The glasses disappeared, replaced by the dent where his eyes had been. "But I have come too far. I will be denied of Yui no longer."  
就在真嗣即将松开 SDAT 的瞬间，源堂的手如铁钳般紧紧抓住了他的手腕。巴迪尔发出恐惧的尖叫。“对不起，真嗣，”他说道。眼镜消失，取而代之的是他眼睛原本所在位置的凹陷。“但我已经走得太远。我不会再被剥夺与唯的联系。”

The bond shattered before the Angel was successfully extracted from Shinji. He gasped in the Entry Plug, eyes wide, with he sensation of a frigid, rotten hand clutching at his very sens of self. Something beyond Bardiel, beyond Ayanami or the roundel on his side had pulled him back. The sync deepened, opening the gates of the core.  
在天使成功从真嗣体内被抽离之前，这份联系已然破碎。他在插入栓中喘息，双眼圆睁，感觉到一只冰冷腐烂的手正紧紧抓住他的自我意识。有某种超越巴迪尔、超越绫波或他身侧圆盘的东西将他拉了回来。同步率加深，开启了核心的大门。

"Mother." “妈妈。”

Uni 01's eyes glistened a vibrant violet.  
01 号机的眼中闪烁着鲜艳的紫罗兰色。

With both spears absorbed within Lilith and the Anti-verse collapsing, there was little time left to change the tide. Unit 13's additional arms unwound from it's chest, jaws opening to release a brutal, despaired and furious bellow. Frustration was the last emotion Shinji was able to discern from whatever remained of their severed bond.  
随着两把长矛被莉莉丝吸收，反宇宙正在崩塌，改变局势的时间所剩无几。13 号机的额外手臂从胸前展开，张开巨口，发出一声绝望而愤怒的咆哮。愤怒是真嗣能从他们断裂的联系中感受到的最后一种情绪。

"I've told you, violence will solve nothing. You cannot defeat me," Gendo boomed. "I had assumed you would understand. It is already too late; the tangible and imaginary are merging." The Eva crouched like a snake ready to strike. "Hand over Yui and the angel, and let us be done with this. You too will find peace in this new world, you will be one with your precious villagers, and with the Shikinami clone."  
“我已经告诉过你，暴力解决不了任何问题。你无法击败我，”源堂大声说道，“我本以为你会明白。现在已为时过晚；有形与无形正在融合。”Eva 如蓄势待发的蛇般蹲伏着。“交出唯和天使，让我们结束这一切。在这个新世界里，你也会找到安宁，与你的珍贵村民们，以及式波克隆体合为一体。”

Whereas the Eva's speed had been blinding before, Shinji saw it move almost in slow motion.  
尽管之前 Eva 的速度快得令人目眩，但真嗣现在几乎能看到它以慢动作移动。

_This plane_ _is create__d_ _by_ _both_ _will and memories,_ Ayanami explained. _And now, your will is superior to that of your father. It will give you a slight advantage._ Unit 01 dodged, trapped one of the opponent's foot and catapulted it back to the train station. The Eva sprung back its feet, two of its four hands desperately clutched at its head._He is reaching a breaking point._  
绫波解释说，这个空间是由意志和记忆共同创造的。而现在，你的意志超越了你父亲。这将给你带来些许优势。初号机闪避，困住对方的一只脚，将其弹回火车站。Eva 双脚着地，四只手中有两只绝望地抱住头部。他快要崩溃了。

"Why must you stand in my way…" growled Gendo. Unit 13 open maw drooled, eyes and armor shifting to vibrant red. "Why must you _all_ stand in my way?" A roar reverberated around the Earth and cracked the walls of the Anti-verse. "Give her back to me!"  
"为何你一定要挡我的路……" 源渡咆哮道。十三号机张开巨口，唾液滴落，眼睛和装甲转为鲜红色。"为何你们都要挡我的路？" 一声咆哮响彻地球，震裂了反宇宙的墙壁。"把她还给我！"

Shinji pivoted to the right, dodging the next tackle and taking a hold of Unit 13's lower left arm and pinning it to the ground. "Please, Father," he muttered. "I don't want to hurt you. I understand, I do but… this path will not lead you back to Mother!"  
真嗣向右转身，躲过了下一次扑击，抓住了十三号机的左下臂并将其按在地上。"请原谅，父亲，"他低语。"我不想伤害你。我理解，我真的理解，但……这条路不会带你回到母亲身边！"

A third roar and Gendo's AT-Field sent him flying. Shinji landed on his feet right on time to dodge several open handed strikes. It was almost as if Unit 13 wanted to trap and embrace him, with each failed attempt turning the behemoth more bestial. Unit 01 took a leap back, barely avoided a bite and crouched so as to not be vaporized with a monstrous blast. The ground began to crack as the sky darkened. The more irate Unit 13 grew, the more unstable the Anti-verse became.  
又一声咆哮，源渡的 AT 力场将他击飞。真嗣稳稳落地，及时躲开了几次掌击。十三号机仿佛想要捕捉并拥抱他，每一次失败都让这巨兽变得更加野蛮。初号机向后一跃，险险避开了一次咬击，蹲下身以免被一次可怕的爆炸蒸发。地面开始裂开，天空变得昏暗。十三号机越愤怒，反宇宙就越不稳定。

Closed fists started seeking Unit 01's chin and body, with each punch thrown leaving a sizable dent on the ground. The world quaked under Gendo's wrath, yet no matter how much he tried, Unit 01 evaded him at the last second. Instead of mimicking the four-armed Evangelion, Shinji seemed able to predict its every move, but chose not to counterattack.  
紧握的拳头开始寻找初号机的下巴和身体，每一拳落下都在地面留下深深的凹陷。世界在源堂的怒火下颤抖，然而无论他如何努力，初号机总在最后一刻避开。与模仿四臂福音战士不同，真嗣似乎能预知其每一个动作，却选择不进行反击。

"Enough!" Gendo's voice rang loud enough to break the surface they stood on. Crimson eyes shone a bright yellow and released a massive blast. "There is no longer a need for discourse between us. You understand nothing."  
“够了！”源堂的声音响彻云霄，足以震碎他们脚下的地面。赤红的双眼闪烁着明亮的黄色，释放出巨大的冲击波。“我们之间已无需再谈。你什么都不懂。”

Unit 01 responded in kind with a blast of its own. "I do, Father," Shinji grunted. "I'm sorry, too. I can't let you do this!"  
初号机以自己的冲击波回应。“我懂，父亲，”真嗣咬牙道，“我也感到抱歉。我不能让你这么做！”

Neither beam reached its target, they met in the middle and battled for dominance. The resulting shock-wave erased whatever remained of the illusory world within the Anti-verse. Both Evas landed on one of Lilith's massive shoulders. Unit 01 was tackled to its back next, with the other Eva using all four arms to keep him in place. Inside the Entry Plug, Shinji felt guilt echo from the core, followed by longing and slight annoyance.  
两道光束均未命中目标，它们在中间相遇并争夺主导权。由此产生的冲击波抹去了反宇宙中虚幻世界的残余。两台 EVA 降落在莉莉丝巨大的肩膀上。初号机被扑倒在地，另一台 EVA 用四只手臂将其牢牢按住。在插入栓内，真嗣感受到了从核心传来的愧疚，随后是渴望和轻微的恼怒。

Somehow, Unit 13's strength was not as absolute as before. Shinji kicked the Eva away with a roar of his own, irises shifting to a vibrant red. Unit 01's eyes and armor followed suit; the halo reappeared on its head, and its left arm glowed a deep blood red. LCL boiled around him, yet there was no scalding sensation. If anything, it felt akin to the time Asuka had embraced him.  
不知为何，十三号机的力量不再像之前那样绝对。真嗣怒吼一声，将 EVA 踢开，虹膜变成了鲜艳的红色。初号机的眼睛和装甲也随之变化；头上的光环重新出现，左臂发出深红色的光芒。LCL 在他周围沸腾，却没有烫伤的感觉。如果说有什么感觉的话，那就像当初明日香拥抱他时的温暖。

"I will be the center of Instrumentality," Gendo rasped. Unit 13 moved again at binding speed, catapulting them both to a floating slab of rubble. "Bardiel, Yui, come to me at once. The time has come."  
“我将作为人类补完计划的核心，”碇源堂嘶哑地说道。十三号机以束缚般的速度再次移动，将他们两人带到一块漂浮的碎石上。“第十三使徒，唯，立刻来到我身边。时机已到。”

"Mother-" Shinji retorted, panting, and headbutted Unit 13. "-Would like a word." He pushed the Eva's head away with his forearm, twisted his hip and gained the upper hand, pinning his father on the ground. "Please stop. That's what she wants, that's what she's screaming in my ears." The Eva trashed about like a cornered animal , eyes glistening and reducing everything in its vicinity to ash. "Don't you care about what _she_ wishes?"  
"母亲——" 真嗣反驳道，喘着气，用头撞向 13 号机。"-想和你谈谈。" 他用前臂推开 Eva 的头，扭动臀部，占据上风，将父亲按在地上。"请停下来。这就是她想要的，她在我耳边尖叫的就是这个。" Eva 像被困的野兽一样挣扎，眼睛闪烁着光芒，将周围的一切化为灰烬。"难道你不关心她的愿望吗？"

"What do _you_ know about Yui?" Gendo uttered, rage spewing from his tone. "I will not stop. I cannot."  
"你对 Yui 了解多少？" 源堂咆哮道，语气中充满了愤怒。"我不会停下。我不能。"

Lilith's eyes drew to them. One of her monstrous hands curled around the rock they had landed on, imprisoning both Evangelions in its clutch. Massive wings sprouted from its back and engulfed a good portion of the planet. The pillars holding off the onslaught from another Impact started to fall. Close to the ruins in Village 1, the penguins huddled together around Shinji's makeshift kitchen as gigantic crosses pressed against the failing barrier. Hikari and Toji held each other and Tsubame in the shelter, while Ryoji huddled with the younger children. Kensuke stood by the main gate, unblinking, camera in hand. _We believe, Shinji._  
莉莉丝的眼睛转向他们。她那只巨大的手环绕着他们坠落的岩石，将两台 Eva 困在掌中。巨大的翅膀从她背后展开，覆盖了大片星球。支撑着阻止另一次冲击的柱子开始倒塌。在第 1 村废墟附近，企鹅们围在真嗣的临时厨房周围，巨大的十字架压向即将崩溃的屏障。在避难所里，光和剑介抱着燕，而阿薰则与年幼的孩子们挤在一起。健介站在大门旁，目不转睛，手中拿着相机。我们相信你，真嗣。

Unit 13 took hold of Unit 01's head, almost cradling the facial mask with its hands. The Eva tried to pry itself free to no avail, forcibly carried to be held before Lilith's smiling visage. "You can rest now, Shinji," Gendo whispered. "You too, shall find peace in this new world. You shall see them all again, your precious bonds."  
13 号机紧紧抓住了 01 号机的头部，仿佛用双手温柔地托着面具。EVA 试图挣脱却徒劳无功，被强行带到莉莉丝微笑的面容前。“你可以休息了，真嗣，”碇源堂低声说道，“在这个新世界里，你也会找到安宁。你会再次见到他们，你珍视的那些羁绊。”

"No," Shinji replied sadly. "No, I won't. Not all of them."  
“不，”真嗣悲伤地回答，“不，我不会。并非所有人。”

Lilith's AT-field manifested from behind Unit 13. Something was trying to reach them, something powerful enough to no be reduced to LCL being so close to the Impact's epicenter.  
莉莉丝的 AT 力场从 13 号机后方显现。有什么东西正试图触及他们，那股力量强大到在冲击中心如此近的距离内未被化为 LCL。

"The WUNDER and its crew should not exist anymore," Gendo whispered, incredulous. Behind them, the ship's engines blasted at top speed. "This is impossible."  
“WUNDER 号及其船员本不该再存在，”源堂低语，难以置信。在他们身后，飞船的引擎正以全速轰鸣。“这不可能。”

Shinji smiled. "There are no impossible things," he stated. "Are there, Viko?"  
真嗣微笑道：“世上没有不可能的事，”他断言，“对吧，维克？”

---

"No, no, no, no, _nyet_! Ah, _blyat_! So god damn lame!"  
“不，不，不，不，不！啊，该死！真是太逊了！”

Viko tried to slam his fist on the display, only to almost tip and fall to Hyuga's station. He coughed, holding onto his bleeding abdomen with one hand, and kept pressing buttons in hopes of finding a good song. One of Lilith's hands blocked his way and began to push the ship back. Mari continued to mow down enemies from atop the WUNDER, extending Unit 08's AT-Field like a scythe.  
Viko 试图一拳砸在显示屏上，却差点失去平衡摔向日向的工位。他咳嗽着，一手捂住流血的腹部，继续按键寻找一首好歌。Lilith 的一只手挡住了他的去路，开始将飞船推回。Mari 继续从 WUNDER 顶端扫射敌人，将 08 号机的 AT 力场延伸得像一把镰刀。

"_There's no end to these wankers, Vi-kun,"_ she grumbled. _"Found a nice song for us yet?"_  
“这些混蛋没完没了，Vi-kun，”她咕哝道，“找到适合我们的好歌了吗？”

"Doing my best," Viko grumbled back, and pushed the next available lever to increase the engine thrust. "Not done yet, you blue-haired demon! Coming through!"  
“我尽力了，”Viko 咕哝着回应，并推动下一个可用的拉杆增加引擎推力。“还没完呢，你这蓝发恶魔！我来了！”

The vessel's wings began to give out under the near impregnable shield. Unbeknownst to him, Viko had activated the radio feed and was broadcasting to the emergency pods, Village 1 and all remaining human strongholds. Amidst explosions and the intro to several classical and pop pieces, the survivors heard the man scream in triumph after finding a song he liked.  
飞船的机翼在几乎坚不可摧的护盾下开始失效。他并不知情，Viko 已经激活了无线电广播，向紧急逃生舱、第一村以及所有剩余的人类据点发送信号。在爆炸声和几首古典及流行音乐的序曲中，幸存者们听到他在找到一首喜欢的歌曲后兴奋地尖叫。

"Victory!" Viko screamed, then groaned in pain and coughed. "Ah, bless Hyuga and his... taste in music."  
“胜利了！”Viko 尖叫道，随即痛苦地呻吟并咳嗽起来。“啊，感谢 Hyuga 和他……的音乐品味。”

"_Yes! Now that's what I call a classics,"_ Mari agreed with a happy sigh. _"Well, time for a certain someone to go do boring stuff."_ Unit 02's Entry plug was place on the emergency set of engines she had prepared beforehand, and flew away to the Village. _"Say hi to your trees for me! Sweet dreams, Princess!"_  
“没错！这才叫经典。”Mari 满意地叹息道。“好了，是时候让某人去做些无聊的事了。”02 号机体的插入栓被放置在她事先准备好的紧急引擎上，飞向村庄。“替我向你的树问好！晚安，公主！”

Metal screeched and wailed as it was crushed against the barrier. Unit 08 jumped to the front of the ship and roared, revealing a set of blood red eyes hiding beneath the mask. The Eva's AT-Field took the form of two massive arms that took hold of the barrier and slowly began to pry it open. They began to slowly push the hand back, fueled by the power of the enhanced WUNDER.  
金属在屏障的挤压下发出刺耳的尖叫。08 号机跃至舰船前方，咆哮着，露出一双隐藏在面具下的血红色眼睛。EVA 的 AT 力场化作两只巨大的手臂，紧紧抓住屏障，缓缓将其撑开。在增强版 WUNDER 的力量驱动下，它们开始慢慢将屏障推回。

"I'm on the run," Viko sang with a broad smile. "But I ain't got no gun! See, they want to be the star, and they're fighting a tribal war!"  
“我在逃亡，”Viko 带着灿烂的笑容唱道，“但我没带枪！看，他们想成为明星，却在进行一场部落战争！”

"_I'm gonna be iron!"_ Mari sang back through gritted teeth. _"Like a lion in Zion! Iron! Like a lion in Zion!"_  
“我要成为钢铁！”Mari 咬牙切齿地回应，“像锡安的狮子一样！钢铁！像锡安的狮子一样！”

All around the world, the voices of every surviving human joined the chant. Ryoji recognized the voice instantly and stood up, singing along with enthusiasm despite the trial of tears coursing down his face. The AT-Field gave under at last, and the vessel's remains easily pierced Lilith's flesh. The echo of thousands reached the Anti-verse.  
世界各地，所有幸存人类的呼声汇聚成一片呐喊。Ryoji 立刻辨认出了那个声音，他站起身来，尽管泪水横流，仍热情地跟着唱。AT 力场终于崩溃，船只残骸轻易穿透了 Lilith 的肉体。成千上万的声音回荡在反宇宙中。

"_Iron, Lion, Zion! Iron, lion Zion!"_  
“铁狮，锡安！铁狮，锡安！”

"The rest is in your hands, Shinji. Remember to drink your lemonade." The WUNDER's mainframes began to explode and burn. Viko raised both hands, no longer concerned with stifling the bleeding, and closed his eyes. "I'm coming home, brother."  
“剩下的就交给你了，Shinji。记得喝你的柠檬水。”WUNDER 的主机开始爆炸燃烧。Viko 举起双手，不再理会伤口的流血，闭上了眼睛。“我回家了，兄弟。”

He never stopped smiling.  
他始终面带微笑。

---

The shifting form of the WUNDER flew towards Lilith's other hand like an arrow.  
WUNDER 那变幻莫测的形态如箭矢般飞向莉莉丝的另一只手。

The hand exploded in a gory spectacle of flesh and blood. The ensuing aftershock separated both Evangelions, throwing Unit 13 back into the giant's face. Unit 01 was slammed into a piece of rubble. The crimson armor shifted to a blinding yellow, and held in its glistening arm rested the newly crafted spear of Gaious.  
那只手在血肉横飞的壮观景象中爆炸开来。随之而来的冲击波将两台 EVA 分开，将 13 号机甩回到巨人的脸上。01 号机则被猛地撞进了一块碎石中。猩红的装甲转变为刺眼的黄色，而在其闪耀的手臂中，紧握着新铸成的盖乌斯之矛。

"I guess this evens the field a little," Shinji whispered. His grip on the hilt tightened. _Do you feel that?_ _Humanity's_ _will,_ whispered Rei. _All those who still live, all those entrapped in the Wanderers. Their struggle to survive and pursue happiness, their desire to live in_ _**this**_ _world have been hone__d_ _into this weapon._  
"我想这稍微平衡了局面，" 真嗣低声说道。他握住剑柄的手更紧了。你感觉到了吗？人类的意志，雷说道。所有活着的人，所有被困在流浪者中的人。他们为生存和追求幸福的斗争，他们在这个世界生活的渴望，都被锻造成了这把武器。

Shinji gazed down to admire the colors, and could not help but smile. "Red and blue, huh," he said. His left hand rose to caress the roundel. "Thank you, everyone. I won't let you down. Not this time."  
真嗣低头欣赏着颜色，忍不住微笑。"红色和蓝色，是吧，" 他说道。他的左手抬起，轻抚着圆形徽章。"谢谢大家。我不会让你们失望的。这次不会。

"_Sorry I'm late, Puppy!"_ Mari yelled through the Comm, landing beside him. _"Had to make sure your Princess was safe._ _Not to be rude, but your dad is being a bit of a wanker right now."_ Th pink Eva produced a plug sync disruptor from its back. _"I'm glad I picked this up! Whoops!"_  
"抱歉我来晚了，小狗！" 玛丽通过通讯器喊道，落在他身边。"得确保你的公主安全。不是有意冒犯，但你爸现在有点像个混蛋。" 粉色的 EVA 从背后拿出一个插头同步干扰器。"幸好我捡到了这个！哎呀！

A massive blast erased the rock they had been standing on. Unit 13 flew towards them like a hungered beast, mouth agape and all four arms outstretched. It landed on a smaller piece of debris on all fours, then sprung towards Unit 01. Shinji slammed the spear into its midsection and sent the mighty embodiment of despair flying straight into Mari's arms.  
一声巨响将他们脚下的岩石炸得粉碎。13 号机如饥渴的野兽般朝他们扑来，张开大口，四臂齐伸。它四肢着地落在一块较小的残骸上，随即弹射向 1 号机。真嗣将长矛猛刺入其腹部，将这绝望的化身直直击飞到真希的怀中。

Unit 08 wrapped its arms and legs around the Eva, but was headbutted and kicked away. "A failed Adam experiment and Iscariot herself," Gendo spat out with bitterness. "Your feeble wills are nothing compared to mine."  
8 号机用四肢紧紧缠住 Eva，却被头槌和踢击甩开。“失败的亚当实验品和伊斯卡里奥特本人，”碇源堂带着苦涩吐露，“你们那微弱的意志根本无法与我匹敌。”

Lilith's remaining hand attempted to trap Unit 01 again, only to be sliced in half with a flick of Shinji's wrist. Unit 13 summoned back the spear of Cassius and tried to impale the Eva next. Dodging the strike was easy, to Shinji's surprise. He pivoted left and grasped at the spear's blade, then punched Unit 13 square in the face with the hilt of his weapon.  
莉莉丝剩下的手试图再次困住 1 号机，却被真嗣手腕一抖斩成两截。13 号机召回卡修斯之矛，试图再次刺穿 Eva。真嗣轻松躲开了这一击，令他惊讶的是，他向左一转，抓住矛刃，然后用武器柄部狠狠击中了 13 号机的面部。

_Everything's moving so slowly,_ Shinji thought. Grief enveloped the Entry Plug at the sight of Unit 13 viciously trying to sink its jaws into Unit 01. _Mother, maybe you miss him,_ _too?_ _Did you have one, as well?_ He asked, dodged another series of tackles and strikes. _A place you wanted to see again?_ _Is Father_ _a_ _treasure to you?_ Tears burned in his eyes and faded in the LCL. _I've found treasure of my own. Can you help me protect it?_  
一切似乎都变得如此缓慢，真嗣心想。看到 13 号机凶狠地试图咬住 01 号机，悲伤笼罩了插入栓。妈妈，也许你也想念他吧？你也有过这样的地方吗？他问道，躲避着又一轮的扑击和攻击。你曾渴望再次见到的地方？父亲对你来说是珍宝吗？泪水在眼中灼热，又在 LCL 中消散。我找到了自己的珍宝。你能帮我保护它吗？

Gendo's voice cut through the bond with the core. "What else must I sacrifice, Yui?" Unit 13 roared, sprouting its own set of wings. "What else is left?"  
源堂的声音穿透了与核心的联系。“我还必须牺牲什么，唯？”13 号机咆哮着，长出了自己的翅膀。“还有什么剩下？”

"You never had to sacrifice anything, Father," Shinji replied, pointing to the four armed Evangelion with the spear's tip. "Only your fear."  
“父亲，你从未牺牲过任何东西，”真嗣回答，用长矛尖端指向那四臂使徒。“只是你的恐惧。”

"Fear?" Gendo flew to him like a hawk chasing prey. "What could I possibly be afraid of at this point?"  
"恐惧？" 源度如鹰隼捕猎般扑向他。"此时此刻，我还有什么可害怕的呢？"

The spear of Gaious glowed, releasing a beam that sliced off two of Unit 13's arms, which regenerated in an instant. The extra second produced by the impact was all Mari needed; she pounced on God's Eva again, this time from the front, and pierced its chest all the way down to the core with the override signal plug. The crimson eyes died down, the wings faded, and its body went limp.  
盖乌斯的矛闪耀着光芒，释放出一道光束，切断了 13 号机两条手臂，它们瞬间再生。冲击带来的额外一秒正是真希波所需的；她再次扑向神之 EVA，这次是从正面，将控制信号插头直刺其胸膛直至核心。赤红的双眼黯淡下来，翅膀消散，它的身躯也瘫软无力。

"_Time for a little nap, Gendo-kun,"_ she said. Unit 08's hand patted the other behemoth's shoulder, as if comforting it. "_Us adults have to go clean up your mess now. Cheeri-o!"_  
"该小憩一会儿了，源度君，" 她说道。08 号机的手轻拍着另一巨人的肩膀，仿佛在安慰它。"我们这些大人现在得去收拾你的烂摊子了。再见啦！"

Unit 01 floated down. Its glistening arm extended o the other Eva's chest, but was met with a massive AT-Field. "Sometimes, even if we sacrifice everything, we don't get what we want," Shinji whispered. A gentle thrust from the spear was powerful enough to crack the field like glass.  
初号机缓缓降下。它闪耀的手臂伸向另一台 EVA 的胸膛，却遭遇了巨大的 AT 力场。“有时候，即便我们牺牲一切，也得不到我们想要的。”真嗣低语。长矛轻轻一刺，便足以像击碎玻璃般破解力场。

As it had done with Unit 02, the mighty Evangelion sunk its hand through armor, flesh and bone, and reached the souls nestling within the core. Unit 13's eyes would come alive for a few seconds; it would flail and thrash about pointlessly before collapsing back to Unit 08's hold. Cobalt and red blood flowed into Unit 01, burning their way up to Shinji's arm. It felt akin to lava being injected into his veins, yet paled in comparison to the agony nestling in his being.  
如同对待二号机那样，强大的福音战士将手穿透装甲、血肉与骨骼，触及了核心中栖息的灵魂。十三号机的双眼会短暂亮起；它会无用地挣扎扭动，随后再次倒回八号机的掌控中。钴蓝与鲜红的血液流入初号机，灼烧着涌向真嗣的手臂。那种感觉如同熔岩注入血管，但与他内心的痛苦相比，却显得微不足道。

When his eyes opened next, Shinji was standing in a dark room with no windows. Gendo lay on the ground, clutching at his right arm as though in pain. His face held no expression, not that there was much he could convey with a denture on his face.  
当他的眼睛再次睁开时，真嗣站在一个没有窗户的黑暗房间里。源渡躺在地上，紧抓着右臂，似乎很痛苦。他的脸上没有任何表情，事实上，戴着假牙的他能传达的情绪也有限。

"Do you… hate me, Father?" Shinji inquired quietly. He felt another presence briefly manifest behind him, and lay a comforting hand on his shoulder. "I don't dislike you. It would be like… disliking myself, and I've done plenty of that, already."  
"父亲，你……讨厌我吗？" 真嗣轻声问道。他感觉到另一个存在短暂地出现在身后，并温柔地把手放在他的肩上。"我不讨厌你。那就像……讨厌自己一样，而我早已做过很多次了。"

"So this... was the scenario all along," Gendo rasped tiredly. "My wish was not her wish at all, in the end." He turned to Shinji. "Perhaps I do fear you. I fear… bonds. A world without Yui where existence was pleasant was terrifying. Inconceivable."  
"原来……一切都是这样的局面，" 源渡疲惫地沙哑说道。"我的愿望最终并非她的愿望。" 他转向真嗣。"也许我真的害怕你。我害怕……羁绊。一个没有唯的世界，存在变得愉快，这太可怕了。难以想象。"

"After a few weeks in the village, I though about Third Impact." Shinji sat on the ground next to his father. "What I was willing to do to get Ayanami back, what it would mean to lose her forever. Before I became a pilot, I was so terrified of hurting people or being hurt by them. Forging bonds with others was frightening to me." The battles with Uni 03 and the Tenth Angel flashed through both their minds. "And after having forged bonds without even realizing it… being alone again felt like hell itself."  
"在村子里待了几周后，我想到了第三次冲击。" 真嗣坐在父亲旁边地上。"我为了找回绫波愿意做的一切，以及永远失去她的意义。在我成为驾驶员之前，我非常害怕伤害别人或被他们伤害。与他人建立联系对我来说是可怕的。" 与三号机和第十使徒的战斗在他们两人的脑海中闪过。"而在不知不觉中建立了联系之后……再次孤独一人感觉就像地狱。"

"Then why would you stop me?" Gendo demanded, exhausted and desperate. He tried to move, to rise to his feet, but was paralyzed on the floor. "Why would you not want this world I tried to create?"  
“那你为什么要阻止我？”源渡质问道，疲惫而绝望。他试图移动，想要站起来，却被困在地板上动弹不得。“为什么你不想看到我试图创造的世界？”

Asuka's scowl manifested in Shinji's mind. The sad smile returned to his features. "Rewriting or restarting everything would be selfish. It'd be like running away, and," he chuckled, cradling the roundel between is fingers, "I have a feeling those I hold dear would not approve."  
明日香皱眉的形象在真嗣心中浮现。他脸上再次露出了悲伤的微笑。“重写或重启一切都是自私的。这就像是在逃避，而且，”他轻笑一声，手指间捧着圆盘，“我有种感觉，那些我珍视的人不会赞同。”

He placed the SDAT in Gendo's hand and pressed both against the man's chest. "Despair is like a disease," Shinji whispered. "You don't cure a disease by spreading it to more people. It's not simply going to fade in a fog, not even in that world you want to create." He stood and headed back to the light. "We can't run away from despair. All we can do is try to bring some goodness into the world, in any small way that's available. Little by little, we make our way towards redemption."  
他将 SDAT 放在源渡手中，并将其紧贴在男人的胸口。“绝望就像一种疾病，”真嗣低声说，“你不能通过将其传播给更多人来治愈疾病。它不会简单地消失在雾中，甚至在你想要创造的那个世界里也不会。”他站起身，走向光明。“我们无法逃避绝望。我们能做的就是尽力为这个世界带来一些美好，无论多么微小。一点一滴，我们朝着救赎前进。”

"Shinji." Gendo said. His visage turned human at last. The glasses fell off his face, cracking on the floor. "What will you do?"  
"真嗣。" 源渡说道。他的面容终于变得人性化。眼镜从他脸上滑落，摔碎在地上。"你打算怎么做？"

"An impossible thing," Shinji, almost too quietly for Gendo to hear. Mother's form solidified behind him. "I'll try to rebuild, to heal enough so that those precious to me can see a world where the sky is blue."  
"一件不可能的事，" 真嗣轻声说道，几乎让源渡听不见。母亲的身影在他身后凝实。"我会尝试重建，治愈到足以让那些对我珍贵的人能看到一个蓝天依旧的世界。"

He saw tears glisten in his father's eyes. "Y-Yui, wait, please. I can fix this, don't leave. Please…"  
他看到父亲眼中闪烁着泪光。"不，由依，等等，求你。我能修复这一切，别离开。求求你…"

Yui Ikari smiled warmly. _If it's a boy, Shinji. If_ _it'__s a girl, Rei._  
绫波唯温暖地微笑着。如果是男孩，就叫真嗣。如果是女孩，就叫丽。

Pain stabbed at Shinji's heart upon seeing his father reach out with such desperation. "In the end, you'll be with her again, Father. You have my word."  
看到父亲如此绝望地伸出手，痛苦刺痛了真嗣的心。“最终，您会再次与她在一起的，父亲。我向您保证。”

---

A deep breath which did not stink of LCL filled Shinji's lungs.  
一股没有 LCL 异味的深呼吸充满了真嗣的肺部。

Ocean breeze, burning wood and fish grilling by the fire. Cold night air coming through the window, the squeaks from the penguins before sunset. Water flowing down the creek, the gentle sway of Viko's trees, and the lingering scent of strawberry. Red locks danced in the wind. Shinji exhaled, returning to the Entry Plug.  
海风轻拂，燃烧的木柴与篝火旁烤鱼的香气。寒夜的空气透过窗户，日落前企鹅的吱吱声。溪水潺潺，Viko 树的轻柔摇曳，以及草莓的余香。红色的发丝在风中舞动。真嗣呼出一口气，回到了插入栓。

Kaworu stood beside him, placid smile ever present. "With the spear of Gaious and the last Angels, you can choose which path to take. One that hopefully leads to your happiness."  
渚薰站在他身旁，平静的微笑始终如一。“有了盖乌斯之矛和最后的使徒，你可以选择走哪条路。希望那条路能带给你幸福。”

"I already found my happiness," Shinji replied with a smile and a shrug. "But what about you, Kaworu-kun?'  
“我已经找到了我的幸福，”真嗣笑着耸了耸肩，“但你呢，渚薰君？”

Kaworu blinked, taken aback. "You have? Oh," he nodded. "So, are you at peace with this? You… will not be able to see them again, Shinji. You will be alone."  
渚薰眨了眨眼，有些惊讶。“你已经知道了？哦，”他点点头。“那么，你对此感到平静吗？你……将无法再见到他们，真嗣。你会孤独一人。”

"That's okay." Shinji unclasped the roundel from his plugsuit and held it in his palm, staring at it fondly. Only when he noticed a speck of blood staining the cute pirate skull did he remember the bullet lodged in his shoulder. "I think I'll manage this time. You don't have to be tied to me, anymore. I'd-" he paused and thought of Ayanami. "I'd like you to make bonds of your own. Find your treasure, Kaworu-kun."  
“没关系。”真嗣解开他驾驶服上的圆形徽章，握在掌心，深情地凝视着。直到他注意到可爱的海盗骷髅上沾染了一丝血迹，才想起自己肩上嵌着的子弹。“我想这次我能应付得来。你不必再与我绑在一起了。我……”他顿了顿，想起了绫波。“我希望你能建立自己的联系。找到属于你的宝藏，薰君。”

Unit 01 ripped away the seal of one of Unit 13's Entry Plugs and handed it over to Mari. _"There's a couple of errands I have to run, Puppy. I'll come pick you up when the time comes."_ Unit 08 saluted him and stood, producing a large halo from its back. _"__Make sure to cook the Princess all sorts of tasty dishes!"_  
初号机撕开了十三号机插入栓的封印，递给了真希。“我有些事情要处理，小狗。到时候我会来接你的。”八号机向他敬了个礼，站起身来，背后展开了一个巨大的光环。“记得给公主准备各种美味佳肴！”

"I'd love to," Shinji said. He turned towards what remained of Lilith. Both the spear of Cassius and Longinus reappeared, merging with his Lance. The roundel became impossibly heavy. "Mother, Ayanami… could I see her again? Just one more time?"  
“我很愿意。”真嗣说道。他转向莉莉丝的残骸。卡西乌斯之矛和朗基努斯枪再次出现，与他的长枪融合。圆盘变得异常沉重。“妈妈，绫波……我能再见到她吗？哪怕一次也好？”

---

_Wake up, Princess. 醒来吧，公主。_

"Huh?" “嗯？”

Asuka's eyes opened. Above her, the dark and star-lit sky outside Kensuke's cabin welcomed her. It took her a few seconds to realize she could see out of both eyes. The numbness was gone, so was the constant fatigue which had assaulted for nigh fifteen years. Her hand reached up to prod around the eyebrow and cheek, and finally the eye itself.  
明日香的眼睛睁开了。在她上方，健介小屋外漆黑而星光璀璨的夜空迎接了她。她花了好几秒才意识到自己能用双眼视物。麻木感消失了，持续近十五年的疲惫也一扫而空。她的手伸上去，轻触眉骨和脸颊，最后是眼睛本身。

"It looks just as pretty as the other one."  
"看起来和另一个一样漂亮。"

Sitting across from her and still clad in his plugsuit, Shinji smiled. Asuka felt embarrassment blossom in her belly. The plugsuit covering her was the old, taped-up one she had used during Unit 01's salvage mission. She sat up as well, shoulders slouching. Her hair was longer; Mari had cut it right before the mission yet it cascaded to the floor.  
坐在她对面，仍然穿着驾驶服的 Shinji 微笑着。Asuka 感到腹部涌起一阵尴尬。她身上的驾驶服是旧的，是她在 Unit 01 回收任务中使用的那件，上面还贴着胶带。她也坐了起来，肩膀下垂。她的头发变长了；Mari 在任务前刚给她剪过，但头发依然垂到了地板上。

"You're not really here, are you," she stated. "This is a dream."  
"你其实不在这里，对吧，" 她陈述道。"这是梦。"

"Uhm, kind of?" Shinji replied sheepishly, rubbing the back of his head. "I wanted to see you."  
"呃，算是吧？" 真嗣尴尬地回答，挠了挠后脑勺。"我想见你。"

"What for, idiot?" Asuka grumbled, arms crossed. "You went and did something stupid again, didn't you?"  
"干嘛，笨蛋？" 明日香嘟囔着，双臂交叉。"你又做了什么蠢事，对吧？"

"Again, kind of." Shinji sighed. Asuka noticed the roundel dance in between his fingers. "You said you liked me before, but that… you grew up first," he added, struggling not to stammer. "Do you really feel that way?"  
"再次，算是吧。" 真嗣叹了口气。明日香注意到他手指间旋转的圆形徽章。"你之前说过你喜欢我，但是……你先长大了，"他补充道，努力不让自己结巴。"你真的那么觉得吗？"

Asuka rolled her eyes. "Ugh, what do you think? Do I have to freaking spell it out for you?" She playfully pushed his shoulder. "I was headed for my doom. You expect me to just say some crap that brings no closure like _you_ did?"  
明日香翻了个白眼。“呃，你觉得呢？我非得一字一句给你解释清楚吗？”她开玩笑地推了推他的肩膀。“我正走向末路呢。你指望我像你那样说些无关痛痒的话，一点儿也不给个交代？”

Color rose to Shinji's face. "Y-You just stood up and walked out of the cell! I didn't even have a chance to say anything!"  
真嗣的脸涨得通红。“你、你就那么站起来走出了牢房！我连说话的机会都没有！”

"Say what, exactly?" she retorted with a question of her own. "You had a whole bunch of time to get everything off your chest in the village."  
“具体说什么？”她反问道，“你在村子里有足够的时间把心里话都说出来。”

"No, I didn't!" Shinji said. Both teens got to their feet without noticing. "You tazed me when I tried!"  
"不，我没有！" 真嗣说道。两个少年都没注意到自己站了起来。"你在我尝试的时候电击了我！"

"I had to taze you. We've gone over this!"  
"我不得不电击你。我们已经讨论过这个了！"

"In the exact moment I was trying to give you flowers?"  
"就在我正要给你送花的那一刻？"

Asuka almost stabbed at Shinji's chest with her forefinger. "I said the flowers weren't half bad! What, was I supposed to weep with joy or something?"  
明日香几乎用食指戳向真嗣的胸口。“我说了那些花还不错！怎么，难道我还要喜极而泣不成？”

"Why are you yelling at me? All I wanted was to come and say something!"  
“你为什么对我大喊大叫？我只是想来表达点什么！”

"Okay, then, spit it out!"  
“好吧，那就说出来吧！”

"I alredy told you!" Shinji almost screamed, inches away from her face. "I like you and I don't want to grow up if it means I'll stop feeling like this! So, do you not like me, anymore? I wanted to know! Is that so hard to understand?"  
"我已经告诉过你了！" 真嗣几乎尖叫着，脸离她只有几英寸。"我喜欢你，如果这意味着我会停止这种感觉，我就不想长大！所以，你是不是不再喜欢我了？我想知道！这很难理解吗？"

Blood rushed to Asuka's cheeks. She almost took a back step, but steeled her resolve and forced herself to glare straight into Shinji's eyes. There was embarrassment aplenty in his gaze, hesitation, fear of rejection, youthful energy, but no pity. No deceit.  
血液涌上明日香的 cheeks。她几乎要后退一步，但坚定了决心，强迫自己直视真嗣的眼睛。他的目光中充满了尴尬、犹豫、害怕被拒绝、青春的活力，但没有怜悯。没有欺骗。

Despite her best efforts, Asuka was the first to look away. Her heart started hammering so loudly it consumed the sound of the ocean. "I suppose if you paused the fight with your father to come here, it means a lot to you, huh."  
尽管她尽了最大努力，明日香还是第一个移开了视线。她的心跳得如此剧烈，以至于海浪的声音都被淹没了。"我想如果你为了来这里而暂停了与父亲的战斗，那对你来说一定很重要，对吧。"

"Yeah," Shinji said. His hand curled around the roundel. "It does."  
"嗯，" 真嗣说道。他的手握住了圆形徽章。"确实如此。"

"How's that going, anyway? The fight for the future of humanity."  
"话说回来，那进展如何？为人类未来而战。"

"Oh!" The intensity melted off Shinji's gaze for a moment. "We're winning, I suppose. Yeah, definitely winning."  
"哦！" 真嗣的目光中的紧张感瞬间消散了些。"我想我们在赢，是的，肯定在赢。"

"Good, good, that's good." Asuka turned to the house, then to the ocean, and finally to the floor. "I, uh," she started. "I didn't exactly do a lot of 'growing up' these past few years. So, make your own damn conclusions."  
"好，好，这样很好。" 明日香转向房子，又转向大海，最后看向地板。"我，呃，" 她开口道。"我过去几年里并没有真正'长大'。所以，自己得出结论吧。"

The way he smiled, as though in massive relief and indescribable joy worsened her self-consciousness. That day, he had called her smile 'treasure'. Shinji had gone out of his way to build a small kitchen for her, find her flowers, cook her saporous meals from wild ingredients, and now stood there, with a peaceful expression on his face.  
他微笑的方式，仿佛带着巨大的宽慰和难以言表的喜悦，让她更加自我意识过剩。那天，他称她的微笑为'宝藏'。真嗣不遗余力地为她建造了一个小厨房，找到鲜花，用野生的食材为她烹饪美味的饭菜，现在就站在那里，脸上带着平静的表情。

"Fine!" Asuka growled at last. "I still feel that way. And I… hated knowing that cut on your wrist was my fault. I hated having to force those rations down your throat. You know about my past. I was alone, always being forced to prove my worth by doing this or that. I never had anyone to just… tell me it was okay to be me."  
"好吧！" 明日香终于咆哮道。"我还是那样觉得。而且我……讨厌知道你手腕上的伤口是我的错。我讨厌不得不强行把那些口粮塞进你嘴里。你知道我的过去。我一直是一个人，总是被迫通过做这做那来证明自己的价值。我从未有人……只是告诉我，做自己就好。"

Shinji's arms engulfed her in an unexpected embrace. Strange, how even though it was a dream Asuka could feel his body warmth through the plugsuit, smell his scent, and even hear his pulse. A wave of uncertainty washed over her.  
真嗣的双臂出乎意料地拥她入怀。奇怪，即便是在梦中，明日香也能感受到他通过驾驶服传来的体温，闻到他的气息，甚至听到他的心跳。一股不确定感涌上心头。

"Promise me you'll bring that roundel back. _Truly_ bring it back," she whispered, head tucked in Shinji's shoulder. "No matter what."  
“答应我，你会把那个圆徽带回来。真正地带回来，”她低声呢喃，头靠在真嗣的肩上。“无论发生什么。”

"Asuka," Shinji murmured back. "You know I can't do t-"  
"“明日香，”真嗣轻声回应。“你知道我做不到——”

She shook her head vehemently against his chest, clutching his body close. "Promise."  
她在他胸前猛烈摇头，紧紧抱住他的身体。“答应我。”

"I'll… try my best," Shinji said. He took her head in his hands and kissed her forehead. "Remember; you're Asuka. That'll always be enough."  
“我会……尽我所能，”真嗣说。他双手捧起她的头，亲吻了她的额头。“记住；你是明日香。这就已经足够了。”

Shinji's figure blurred. Everything turned black, and Asuka slept soundly.  
真嗣的身影变得模糊。一切转为黑暗，明日香沉沉睡去。

---

"Will you just lie there, pretending the world doesn't exist?"  
"你就不能躺着，假装世界不存在吗？"

The SDAT's tape rewound and began to play again. Classical pieces had always driven him away from whatever discomforts existence threw his way. Something was amiss, however. The tape was stuck in track 29. The headphones felt like a severed limb that had been returned to him, a welcoming hug akin to those Yui used to provide.  
SDAT 的磁带倒带后再次播放。古典乐曲总能让他远离生活中的一切不适。然而，有些不对劲。磁带卡在了第 29 轨。耳机感觉像是一条被截断后又归还的肢体，那种拥抱的温暖，仿佛是 Yui 曾经给予的。

"I'm afraid of Shinji," he said. His hand gripped the SDAT with vehemence. "I am afraid of an existence without you where I can find meaning. I am… afraid."  
"我害怕真嗣，"他说。他的手紧紧抓住 SDAT，"我害怕在没有你的世界里寻找意义。我……害怕。"

"You don't have to be, dear," Yui murmured back. She crouched and delicately removed the headphones, then traced the line of his beard jaw with her fingers. "I would not have brought Shinji into this world if I didn't believe there was a chance for him to be happy. For _you_ to be happy."  
"亲爱的，你不必这样。" 优轻轻地回应。她蹲下身，小心翼翼地摘下耳机，然后用手指轻抚他胡须下的下巴线条。"如果我不相信他有机会幸福，我就不会把真嗣带到这个世界上。为了你，也为了他。"

"How?" Gendo lamented. "I detest most people. I fear my own son. I surrendered myself to the abyss without thinking for a second that perhaps you would not approve of my cowardice." He shook his head. "I am such a fool."  
"怎么会这样？" 源堂哀叹道。"我讨厌大多数人。我害怕自己的儿子。我未曾考虑过你可能会反对我的懦弱，就把自己交给了深渊。" 他摇了摇头。"我真是个傻瓜。"

"We both are." Yui placed his head on her lap, running one hand through his hair and while the other cradled his cheek. "I had as much control over all of this as you did. Perhaps it was simply meant to be. All I wanted… was a world where my family found happiness," she said. Her voice was soothing; it took away the numbness in his being with every word. "I wanted to protect Shinji."  
"我们都是。" 优将他的头放在自己的腿上，一只手穿过他的头发，另一只手托着他的脸颊。"我和你一样，对这一切无能为力。也许这就是命中注定。我所希望的……只是一个能让我的家人找到幸福的世界，" 她说道。她的声音温柔而抚慰，每一个字都驱散了他心中的麻木。"我想保护真嗣。"

"And all I did was hurt him, take things away from him," Gendo responded, despondent. "Bring him down to my level of grief and despair."  
"而我所做的只是伤害他，夺走他的东西，" 碇源堂回应道，情绪低落。"将他拉到我这般的悲伤与绝望之中。"

"Yes, you did. And through that loss, he understood you. We are blessed," Yui countered with a smile, shifting his gaze to hers as she cupped his cheek. "Despite having such horrendous parents, Shinji has grown into a kind, dedicated young man. We forced him to mature too quickly, both of us." Her smile was exactly as he remembered it, with not a trace of falsehood. "I'd like for him to have some time to _be_ a young man. Have you seen his memories? They are so beautiful. Like ours."  
"是的，你确实如此。但通过这份失去，他理解了你。我们是幸运的，" 绫波零带着微笑反驳道，目光转向她，她用手掌轻抚他的脸颊。"尽管有着如此糟糕的父母，真嗣已经成长为一个善良、专注的年轻人。我们迫使他过早成熟，我们俩都是。" 她的微笑与他记忆中一模一样，没有一丝虚假。"我希望他能有一些时间做个年轻人。你看过他的记忆吗？它们如此美好。就像我们的。"

"Yes," he rasped. "Like ours."  
"是的，" 他嘶哑地说道。"就像我们的。"

"Say," Yui beamed at him. "Want to go slay the gods and the Evangelions? You and I, as it was meant to be."  
"说吧，" 优微笑着对他说，"想不想去击败众神和那些使徒？你和我，这才是我们应有的样子。"

Gendo Ikari smiled at last. "Nothing would make me happier."  
碇源堂终于笑了。"没有什么比这更让我高兴的了。"

---

_An enduring state of mind consisting not only of feelings of joy, contentment, and other positive emotions, but also of a sense that one's life is meaningful and valued.  
一种持久的心态，不仅包含快乐、满足和其他积极情绪，还包含一种感觉，即自己的生活是有意义的，是被珍视的。_

Shinji opened his eyes. Pain erupted from his shoulder, and Bardiel's presence in his body drew an overpowering fatigue to his very bones. "Happiness," he panted. "Thank you, Kaworu-kun. I know what it is, now."  
真嗣睁开了眼睛。疼痛从他的肩膀爆发，巴迪尔在他体内的存在将一种压倒性的疲惫感带到了他的骨髓深处。“幸福，”他喘息着。“谢谢你，薰君。我现在明白了。”

The merged spear pointed at him, with time frozen in a perfect moment. The Wanderers, Angels, Adams, Evangelions, they all awaited his decision, even the parasite settling in his left arm. It felt slightly unjust to use their power, selfishly try to bring some semblance of normalcy to his world, and erase their very existence in the process.  
融合的长矛指向他，时间在完美的瞬间凝固。流浪者、天使、亚当、福音战士，他们都在等待他的决定，甚至连寄生在他左臂的寄生虫也不例外。利用他们的力量，自私地试图给他的世界带来一丝正常感，并在过程中抹去他们的存在，这感觉有些不公平。

"No more curse of Eva," Shinji intoned. "Blue skies, fertile land, clean water. Fresh air. A chance to rebuild."  
“不再有福音的诅咒，”真嗣吟诵道。“蓝天，肥沃的土地，清澈的水。新鲜的空气。一个重建的机会。”

Nodding, Lilith reconstituted her body. The spear pointed at Unit 01's core, with a similar one about to pierce through Shinji's sternum. He winced; the bullet bit from within his flesh with every small movement. Even as it burned, he forced himself to grasp the roundel with both hands. Asuka's words flashed through him, and Shinji was at peace.  
莉莉丝点点头，重构了自己的身体。长矛指向初号机的核心，另一支类似的矛即将刺穿真嗣的胸骨。他皱眉；每一次微小的动作，子弹都从他的肉体中咬出痛感。即便燃烧着，他还是强迫自己用双手抓住圆盘。明日香的话语在他心中闪过，真嗣感到了平静。

_Thank you, Unit 01. Mother.  
谢谢你，初号机。母亲。_

Unit 13's hand halted the spear head at the last second. It was barely functional, eyes flickering on and off, but managed to rip the sync disruptor from its chest. Panic overcame his senses, which quickly morphed to shock and confusion when his mother's figure came alive in the LCL.  
十三号机的手在最后一刻停住了矛尖。它几乎无法运作，眼睛忽明忽暗，但还是设法从胸前撕下了同步干扰器。恐慌占据了它的感官，但当母亲的身影在 LCL 中活过来时，恐慌迅速转变为震惊和困惑。

"Your idiot tree would grow lonely without the frequent visits," she said, smiling. The burning from Bardiel's infection dissipated. Yui placed the SDAT on his free hand. "Be well, my son."  
“没有你这笨蛋树的频繁探访，它会感到孤单的。”她微笑着说。来自 Bardiel 的感染灼烧感消散了。Yui 将 SDAT 放在他空着的手上。“保重，我的孩子。”

Rei Ayanami fell on his lap just as the connection with Unit 01 was severed. The last thing Shinji remembered before falling unconscious was the sight of her long tresses sprawled all over his face.  
就在与 01 号机断开连接的那一刻，绫波零倒在了他的腿上。真嗣在失去意识前最后记得的，是她那长长的发丝散落在他脸上的景象。

---

Unit 01 and 13 embraced just as the spear of Gaious pierced both their cores.  
就在盖乌斯之矛贯穿两者的核心时，01 号机和 13 号机紧紧相拥。

The concentrated life energy of Lilith, endless Wanderers, the surviving Evangelions and the Angels bled into the earth, washing away the effects of Second, Third and near Third Impact with a massive crimson tidal wave. Eroded soils were nurtured, dried wells replenished, the permanently darkened skies cleared, and life was allowed to flourish once again.  
莉莉丝那凝聚的生命能量、无尽的流浪者、幸存的福音战士与天使们，化作一股巨大的猩红浪潮涌入大地，洗去了第二次、第三次及近似第三次冲击的影响。侵蚀的土地得到滋养，干涸的井泉重新充盈，永恒的黑暗天空得以澄清，生命再次得以繁盛。

For many, it would mark the day the endless, torturing dream had ended and they had awoken back on the world, conveniently placed in the vicinity of a human stronghold. For others it was to embody the end of a delicate, isolated life in between pillars.  
对许多人而言，这一天标志着无尽的折磨梦境终于结束，他们醒来回到了这个世界，恰巧被安置在一个人类据点附近。对另一些人来说，这象征着在柱间脆弱孤立生活的终结。

Misato would count it as the day she lost a ship, but gained two sons. It would symbolize the moment she saw Shinji's Entry Plug descend from the heavens and be instantly bombarded by heavy artillery procured by the mutineers. A bit of her faith in humanity would die right there, fueled by the powerful, deadly voice Asuka had used to mobilize the entire village in defense of their savior.  
美里会将这一天视为她失去一艘船，却得到了两个儿子的日子。它象征着她目睹真嗣的插入栓从天而降，随即遭到叛变者提供的重炮猛烈轰击的时刻。那一刻，她对人性的一些信念随之消逝，被明日香动员全村保卫救世主的强大致命声音所助燃。

For Ritsuko, it was Tuesday.  
对律子来说，这只是个普通的星期二。

**To Be Concluded... 未完待续...**

_AN: My eternal gratitude to my brothers **MisterHalt**, **Pilot_Fair**, **WingZeroAlchemist** and **BornToWalken** for helping me improve this chapter. Thank you, you legends! Love ya!  
作者注：我永远感激我的兄弟们 MisterHalt、Pilot_Fair、WingZeroAlchemist 和 BornToWalken，他们帮助我改进了这篇《一千零一夜》。谢谢你们，传奇们！爱你们！_

_I'm relatively dissatisfied with this and the earlier one, since I had to rewatch that fucking movie 4.0 so many times that I almost went insane. At some point that I have time, I might alter some slight details, but the overall content will remain. Gomennasai if these chaps were not up to parr with the rest of the fic, it was more than unpleasant to have to revisit the og material so often.  
我对这个和之前的章节相当不满意，因为我不得不多次重看那该死的电影 4.0，差点让我疯掉。等我有时间，可能会稍微修改一些细节，但整体内容会保持不变。如果这些章节不如其他部分，我深感抱歉，因为反复回顾原始材料实在令人不快。  
_

_I hope I haven't lost you yet. The next chappie will be the official last, to be uploaded very soon! Obviously there will be an epilogue, but a bit later on. I do hope, however, that this next chapter makes up for what hese last two failed to provide. Hopefully! Anyhow. Thank you all so much for reading this lil fic of mine! I hope it at least brought a little entretainment to your day! Any thoughts, critique, feedbak or reccomendations on how to improve this chapter are more than welcome! Thank you so much!  
希望我还没让你失去兴趣。下一章将是正式的最后一章，很快就会上传！显然会有一个尾声，但稍后一些。不过，我确实希望下一章chapter能弥补这两章未能提供的部分。希望如此！无论如何。非常感谢大家阅读我的这个小故事！希望它至少给你的日子带来了一点娱乐！任何想法、批评、反馈或关于如何改进这个chapter的建议都非常欢迎！非常感谢！_

_Remember to stay healhy, do your cardio, drink your lemonade, hug your parents and find your treasure! (Yes I like the pirate theme as it is not so subtly illustrateed in the fic. Arrr matey) Much love, everyone!  
记得保持健康，做有氧运动，喝柠檬水，拥抱你的父母，找到你的宝藏！（是的，我喜欢海盗主题，正如故事中不那么隐晦地描绘的那样。啊，伙计）大家多多关爱！

### Chapter 11 Exodus

_AN: Yesterday marked marked the one year, four month mark since I stopped drinking. Also, on this day fourteen years ago I uploaded the first chapter for my first Evangelion fanfic. I thought it'd be aesthetic to close this fic on the same date. Hopefully, some of my abilities doing this fanfic stuff have improved. In that spirit; I made dis!  
AN: 昨天是我戒酒一周年零四个月的日子。同样，十四年前的今天，我上传了第一篇《新世纪福音战士》同人文的第一章。我觉得在这个日期结束这篇同人文颇有美感。希望我在创作这类同人文的能力上有所提升。带着这份心情，我完成了这篇作品！_

"…_but my head was made strong by the hand of the Almighty, we forward this generation… triumphantly. Won't you help me sing…"_  
“…但我的头颅被全能者之手锻造得坚强，我们引领这一代人…胜利前行。你难道不愿与我同唱…”

Shinji's voice faded away, drowned by what sounded like men, women and children screaming. Asuka's brow furrowed. She shifted her already uncomfortable position in the Entry Plug seat and tried to get back to sleep. If successful, after all, she'd go back to that dream. Being held as the sun set, sitting under the shade of a peach tree as his voice softly caressed her heart and lulled her to blissful rest.  
真嗣的声音渐渐消失，淹没在男女老少的尖叫声中。明日香的眉头紧皱。她调整了一下本就不舒服的插入栓座椅，试图重新入睡。毕竟，如果成功的话，她会回到那个梦里。被拥抱着，夕阳西下，坐在桃树的荫凉下，他的声音温柔地抚慰着她的心灵，引领她进入甜蜜的安眠。

"-ver here! Check the decompression controls! LCL's about to eject, steer clear!"  
"快来这里！检查减压控制！LCL 要排出了，避开！"

"How the hell did it arrive here like this? It looks pristine!"  
"这东西到底是怎么到这里来的？看起来完好无损！"

"Never mind that, get a lever! The emergency exit is jammed!"  
"别管那个了，拿个撬棍来！紧急出口卡住了！"

"So loud," Asuka mumbled, frowning. "Shut up a little, I'm trying to slee...p." She sat up instantly, straining her neck and back in the process. Her bones felt like they were out of lead. She was starving, thirsty and in an extremely foul mood. The aching was gone, so was the parasite nestling in her eye. She was human, at long last. "That idiot. Ugh, always complicating everything."  
"太吵了，" 明日香嘟囔着，皱起眉头。"小声点，我正试着睡...觉呢。" 她立刻坐了起来，过程中扭到了脖子和背部。她的骨头感觉像是灌了铅一样沉重。她饿极了，渴得要命，心情极其糟糕。疼痛消失了，寄生在她眼中的异物也不见了。她终于变回了人类。"那个白痴。唉，总是把事情搞得复杂。

"Get back, kids!" Kensuke said from outside. "We're gonna ram the door!"  
"孩子们，退后！" 从外面传来健司的声音。"我们要撞门了！"

"No, you're not!" Asuka yelled back. Whatever crowd was standing by her Entry Plug quieted instantly. "Jeez, can you be any louder? Do you have any idea," she grumbled, and practically punched the code into the keypad. A loud hiss and a push later brought her to the outside. "Of how long it's been since I had a good night's sleep?"  
"不，你们不能！" 明日香大声回应。站在她插入栓旁的任何人群立刻安静了下来。"天哪，你们能再大声点吗？你们知不知道，" 她咕哝着，几乎是用拳头敲击着键盘。一阵响亮的嘶嘶声和推力之后，她来到了外面。"我有多久没好好睡一觉了？

_The sky,_ she though instantly, and almost ignored Kensuke, Toji and the kids altogether. _It stretches as far as I can see, farther than where the pillars are._  
天空，她立刻想到，几乎忽略了真希波、冬二和孩子们。它延伸到我能看到的尽头，比那些柱子还要远。

"Asuka!" Kensuke embraced her so desperately that his camera fell to the side, forgotten. "You're okay! We were so worried. Hey." He held her at arm's length, fingers almost digging into her shoulders. "Your eye. Asuka, your eye is-"  
“明日香！”真希波紧紧抱住她，以至于相机都掉到了一边，被遗忘了。“你没事！我们都很担心。嘿。”他双手撑开她的肩膀，手指几乎要嵌入她的肩头。“你的眼睛。明日香，你的眼睛——”

"I know," she replied curtly, and pushed him away. "I take it we won?"  
“我知道，”她简短地回答，并推开了他。“我们赢了吧？”

"We did," Toji said. He was holding Tsubame in his arms, which meant there was no immediate danger. "We got a final signal from the WUNDER, then… there was this massive flash. We saw a tsunami make its way over the hills and thought it was the end but," he smiled. "It came and went without harming us. Next thing we knew, the core-ized areas had been cleared."  
"我们确实收到了，" 冬二说道。他怀里抱着燕，这意味着暂时没有危险。"我们收到了 WUNDER 的最终信号，然后……出现了一道巨大的闪光。我们看到海啸翻越山丘，以为一切都完了，但是，" 他笑了笑，"它来了又去，并没有伤害我们。接下来我们发现，核心化区域已经被清除了。"

With her patience running out just as Toji finished speaking, Asuka marched away and headed for the village center. Something in the back of her mind was demanding she go there. Her temper spiked once more after realizing the small crowd was still rooted to the Entry Plug.  
当冬二刚说完话，明日香的耐心也耗尽了，她大步离开，朝村庄中心走去。内心深处有个声音催促她去那里。意识到人群仍然呆在插入栓旁，她的脾气再次爆发。

"What? You want a written invitation?" she growled. "Move! We need to secure the food supplies and make sure some of the crops survived this mess. Someone better have protected my idiot trees." When nobody but Kensuke, Toji and Hikari followed, Asuka turned and glared, eyes narrowing. "Either move or I will _make_ you move. Believe that."  
"什么？你们想要书面邀请吗？" 她咆哮道，"动起来！我们需要确保食物供应安全，并检查一些作物是否在这场混乱中幸存。最好有人保护了我的那些笨树。" 除了健介、冬二和光之外，没有人跟随，明日香转身怒视，眼神锐利。"要么动，要么我让你们动。相信我。"

It irked her how they all smiled, as though her angry retorts were a comforting sight.  
他们全都面带微笑，仿佛她愤怒的反驳是一种令人安心的景象，这让她感到恼火。

---

"You bitch!" “你这个婊子！”

Misato easily evaded the drunken punch thrown by Kitakami. She tripped the mutineer, kicked her in the jaw after she fell, then picked her up by her unnatural pink tresses. "Leave it to you dumb bastards to find a way to ruin a good moment," she said. "I'm in a bad mood to begin with; some weird stranger strangled me to sleep and I ended up missing the whole 'world healing'."  
美里轻松躲开了北上醉醺醺的一拳。她绊倒了叛变者，在她倒地后踢了她的下巴一脚，然后揪起她那不自然的粉色发丝将她提起。“你们这些蠢货总能毁掉一个好时刻，”她说道，“我本来心情就不好；某个奇怪的陌生人勒得我入睡，结果我错过了整个‘世界治愈’的过程。”

"Yeah, talk about a bunch of sour puss party poopers," Ritsuko added from behind. "We went through the trouble of getting you safely out of the ship, without a single casualty caused by your pathetic coup, and this is how you show gratitude for our mercy."  
"是啊，真是一群扫兴的家伙，" 律子从后面补充道。"我们费尽心思把你从船上安全救出，你的可悲政变没有造成任何伤亡，而这就是你对我们的仁慈的回报。"

"Ah, fresh air!" Maya walked to them, hands outstretched. "Senpai, how is this possible? If the readings are correct, the damage after fourteen years is minimal! We're getting confirmation from the nearby villages, too!"  
"啊，新鲜的空气！" 真希走到他们身边，双手伸展开来。"前辈，这怎么可能？如果读数没错，十四年后的损害微乎其微！我们也在从附近的村庄得到确认！"

"Great." Ritsuko groaned and shook her head. "Another reason for me not to smoke my cigarette yet. Just another day in the office, saving and patching up this broken world of ours. Eh, Captain?"  
"太好了。" 律子叹了口气，摇了摇头。"又一个我不抽烟的理由。只是办公室里的又一天，拯救和修补我们这个破碎的世界。嗯，上尉？"

"Yeah, just another day," Misato nodded, eyes glued to the escape pods landing a few miles away. "Get whatever weapons you can find, and follow me."  
“是啊，又是平常的一天。”美里点头道，目光紧盯着几英里外降落的逃生舱。“找到你能找到的所有武器，跟我来。”

There was no time to celebrate. Every second a new problem to solve came to her head. How many people had returned, exactly? How had they returned? What about animals, livestock, resources? The village's emergency supplies were already stretched too thin. What of confusion and anger? If not handled properly, the new world Shinji had gifted them could very well burst into flames from within. Everything, anything to avoid the fact that there was no escaping her son anymore.  
没有时间庆祝。每一秒都有新的问题涌入她的脑海。究竟有多少人回来了？他们是如何回来的？动物、家畜、资源呢？村庄的应急物资已经捉襟见肘。混乱和愤怒又该如何处理？若处理不当，真嗣赐予他们的新世界很可能会从内部燃起战火。所有的一切，任何事情，都为了逃避一个事实——她的儿子再也无法逃离了。

"Any news on Unit 01?" Hyuga asked from behind. "We can't find any abnormal patterns anywhere, blue or otherwise. It's like they simply stopped existing."  
“零一号机有什么消息吗？”日向从后面问道，“我们找不到任何异常模式，无论是蓝色还是其他。它们就像凭空消失了一样。”

"Ground zero's temperature is dropping to what were normal levels before the year 2000," Shigeru reported. "Aside from that, we have nothing."  
"零号地的温度正在下降至 2000 年前的正常水平，" 四郎报告道。"除此之外，我们一无所获。"

"There's a tracking device in every DSS choker," said Misato. "Use it to track down Asuka and Mari. Rits, didn't you set some kind of GPS on Unit 01's Entry Plug?"  
"每个 DSS 项圈里都装有追踪器，" 美里说。"用它来追踪明日香和玛丽。理津子，你不是在零一号机的插入栓上设置了某种 GPS 吗？"

"Something's blocking the signal," Ritsuko replied, producing a handgun from her back. "It's not a pattern we recognize, but I'm triangulating his position with the few satellites that aren't fried." She pointed to the village center with the barrel. "If I was a betting woman, I'd say about half a mile to our left."  
"有什么东西在干扰信号，" 理津子回答，从背后掏出一把手枪。"这不是我们熟悉的模式，但我正在用那些未被摧毁的卫星进行三角定位。"她用枪管指向村庄中心。"如果我是个赌徒，我会说大约在我们左边半英里的地方。"

_It's okay. He's okay. He made it,_ Misato thought. Her hands curled into fists. _He made it, I know he did. It's just a matter of finding him._ "Get as many people as possible after those traitors, and make sure you apprehend them with extreme prejudice," she ground out. "Take them to the warehouse by the ruins."  
没事的。他没事。他做到了，美里想。她的双手紧握成拳。他做到了，我知道他做到了。现在只是找到他的问题。“尽可能多派人手追捕那些叛徒，务必毫不留情地逮捕他们，”她咬牙切齿地说。“把他们带到废墟旁的仓库去。”

"Noted. Maya, be a dear and use that old radio Mari left behind," Ritsuko nodded, leaving about ten crewmen and Sakura with Misato. "Ryoji is in the shelter. He doesn't even know what you look like. Don't be ungrateful; you now owe it to two people. Be a mother."  
“明白。摩耶，亲爱的，用玛丽留下的那台旧无线电，”律子点头道，留下大约十名船员和樱与美里一起。“加持在避难所里。他甚至不知道你长什么样。别不知感恩；你现在欠了两个人的情。做个母亲吧。”

"Give me the stupid tracker," the Captain snapped. "No casualties. I don't want this day spoiled by bloodshed."  
“把那个该死的追踪器给我，”上尉厉声道。“不要有伤亡。我不希望今天被血腥破坏。”

"Famous last words," Ritsuko replied with a small smirk. "Live a little, will you? You owe it to that guy, after all."  
"名言警句啊，" 律子带着一丝狡黠的微笑回答。"活得潇洒点，好吗？毕竟你欠那家伙的。"

It was almost impossible to keep her temper in check, let alone articulate any sort of loving gesture to her child. Misato barely found her way back to the village center. Without everything being covered in red mist and protruding, massive limbs, her usual points of orientation were all but gone. Every way she turned, there were green hills. Her feet dug into the soil instead of barely gliding above core-ized material. Had her mind not been so occupied by the face of that blonde stranger, she could have noticed the smell of rain and not blood.  
她几乎无法控制自己的脾气，更别提向孩子表达任何爱意了。美里勉强找到了回到村庄中心的路。没有了红雾和突出的巨大肢体，她平常的定位点几乎都消失了。无论她转向哪里，都是绿色的山丘。她的脚深深陷入土壤中，而不是几乎滑过核心化的物质。如果不是她的心思全被那个金发陌生人的脸占据，她本可以注意到雨的气味，而不是血腥味。

"You!" Misato bellowed. Koga flinched mid-step and turned to them. "Status report! Injuries, casualties, resources left, go!"  
"你！" 美里咆哮道。古贺一惊，停下脚步转过身来。"报告情况！伤员、伤亡、剩余资源，快说！"

"Uhh." The large man rubbed the back of his head. "Couple of bumps and bruises? One of the wagons collapsed, pillars are fried, we have enough food for about three months I think, and..." He paused, pointing to the hill where Kensuke lived. "Asuka's rounding up the villagers. She's fine, but in the worst mood I've ever seen her."  
"呃。" 这位魁梧的男子揉了揉后脑勺。"几处擦伤和瘀伤？一辆货车塌了，柱子都烧焦了，食物大概够吃三个月吧，我想，还有..." 他顿了顿，指向 Kensuke 居住的山丘。"明日香正在召集村民。她没事，但心情是我见过的最糟糕的。"

_Asuka? Interacting with people? Are we talking about the same person? What's next? Pen Pen's progeny walking along the sidewalk?  
明日香？与人互动？我们说的是同一个人吗？接下来是什么？Pen Pen 的后代在人行道上散步？_

"Captain, I don't mean to sound stupid, but," Sakura pointed at a waddle of black and white birds making their way towards the shelter, "are those penguins? What the hell are they doing so far away from the water?"  
"队长，我不是想显得愚蠢，但是，" Sakura 指着一群黑白相间的鸟正朝避难所走去，"那些是企鹅吗？它们到底是怎么跑到离水这么远的地方来的？"

"God damn it," Misato whispered. The PDA beeped, signaling Shinji's Entry Plug was near. "Koga, get as many hands as we can spare and support Ritsuko. There's about a hundred men and women we need contained."  
"该死," 美里低声咒骂。PDA 发出哔哔声，提示真嗣的插入栓即将到达。"古贺，尽可能多找些人手支援律子。我们需要控制住大约一百名男女。"

Koga nodded, and was about to run to the shelter when his eyes widened. "Those bastards…" he muttered. Misato halted in her tracks. "Two weeks ago, my cousin and some of his drunken friends found an old type 96. They hid it behind the eastern pillar."  
古贺点头，正要跑向避难所时，他的眼睛突然睁大。"那些混蛋……"他喃喃自语。美里停下脚步。"两周前，我表弟和他的一些醉酒朋友找到了一架旧式 96 型。他们把它藏在了东边的柱子后面。"

"Air defense weaponry. Great. Suzuhara, inform Ritz," Misato commanded. Her stride doubled. "What else, snipers on the roofs? Bloodhounds? Heat seeking missiles?"  
"防空武器。太好了。铃原，通知丽兹，" 美里命令道。她的步伐加快了一倍。"还有什么，屋顶上的狙击手？猎犬？热追踪导弹？"

The first explosion came from the eastern pillar itself. The engines had overheated right after Fourth Impact was averted, and a black curtain of smoke now rose to the clouds. That was what first drew their eyes to the floating cylinder making its way through the sky. Then came the second explosion, and the third, and the fourth.  
第一次爆炸源自东侧支柱本身。在第四次冲击被阻止后，引擎随即过热，一团黑烟直冲云霄。这首先吸引了他们注意力的，是那个在空中缓缓移动的悬浮圆柱体。接着是第二次爆炸，然后是第三次，第四次。

Most of the massive cartridges harmlessly bounced off the Entry Plug. Whatever readings the PDA was unable to decipher obviously came from the bizarre, blue and crimson AT-Field that manifested with each shot. The group started running towards the ration center without needing an order. Even if the rounds failed to damage the plug, they would alter its trajectory. A much heavier explosion cut through the air, one powerful enough to blind her.  
大多数巨大的弹药筒无害地从插入栓上弹开。PDA 无法解读的读数显然来自每次射击时显现的奇异蓝红相间的 AT 力场。小组无需命令便开始向补给中心跑去。即便这些弹药未能损坏插入栓，它们也会改变其轨迹。一声更为沉重的爆炸划破空气，威力之大足以令她失明。

Gunshots rang out, followed by the sound of a skirmish in progress and finally, silence. Unit 01's Entry Plug crashed into the ruins of an old shopping mall. When sight returned, Misato saw a purple-haired young man running towards the wreck. He spared her half a glance at best. Asuka's voice was the next thing that registered.  
枪声响起，随后是正在进行的小规模冲突声，最终归于寂静。初号机的插入栓撞入了旧购物中心的废墟中。当视线恢复时，美里看到一个紫发少年正向残骸跑去。他最多只给了她半瞥。接下来是明日香的声音。

"-o time for that, Suzuhara! Get the medical bay running before I decide your daughter will be fatherless!" bellowed the former Second Child. "Kensuke, get a stretcher! Glasses two and three, clean water and bandages! Don't just run in there! Secure the structural integrity first! We don't need to be fishing you out of there, as well! Katsuragi!" Both mother and son turned to the redhead, exchanging a longer glance. "Fastest route to the crash site, lead the way!"  
"-o 该行动了，铃原！在我决定你女儿要成孤儿之前，快把医疗舱启动！" 前二号适格者咆哮道。"健介，拿担架来！眼镜二号和三号，清水和绷带！别光顾着冲进去！先确保结构稳定！我们可不想连你也捞出来，卡兹！葛城！" 母子俩转向红发女子，交换了一个更长的眼神。"去坠机现场的最快路线，带路！"

Ryoji's eyes widened in recognition, and immediately narrowed in anger. "Roger!" he screamed back. "Second door to the left! The emergency stairs should be stable enough! Follow me!"  
碇的眼睛因认出而睁大，随即因愤怒而眯起。"罗杰！"他尖叫着回应。"左边的第二扇门！应急楼梯应该够稳固！跟我来！"

Her feet refused to move. The effects of fourteen years worth of misery and stress began to take their toll on Misato's body. The building blurred in and out of sight. _You're about to have an anxiety attack,_ whispered the logical side of her brain. Why did it have that blonde joker's voice all of the sudden?  
她的脚拒绝移动。十四年累积的痛苦和压力开始在美里身上显现。建筑物在她眼前模糊又清晰。你快焦虑发作了，她理智的那一面低语道。为什么突然间那声音像那个金发小丑？

"Come on, Captain. We need you." Sakura's voice and steady hand on her shoulder brought Misato back to reality. "Deep breaths. Remember, we won. Let's go give Shinji the good news."  
"来吧，队长。我们需要你。" 樱的声音和她稳稳搭在肩上的手将美里拉回了现实。"深呼吸。记住，我们赢了。让我们去告诉真嗣这个好消息。"

---

"-in short, it's all bad. Well, terrible is more accurate. Near catastrophic."  
"简而言之，情况很糟糕。嗯，用糟糕来形容还不够准确，几乎是灾难性的。"

"You're making a mountain out of a molehill, Ritz."  
"你这是小题大做，丽兹。"

"Agree to disagree. Do you know what it's like to go ten years without nicotine in your system, and then pump it back in? Not pleasant. That guy could have at least had the courtesy of leaving me a spare."  
"同意各自表述。你知道十年不碰尼古丁，然后又猛吸一口是什么感觉吗？不怎么愉快。那家伙至少该礼貌性地给我留一包备用。"

"He left you twenty. Twenty, which you smoked in two days."  
"他留给你二十包。二十包，你两天就抽完了。"

"Hey, did _you_ have to do emergency surgery after not sleeping for thirty-six hours? Yeah."  
"嘿，你试过连续三十六小时不睡觉后还得做急诊手术吗？没错。"

_Misato, and Ritsuko. They made it… Ah, I'm glad._ _What is this? Where am I, and why can't I move? I can't feel most of my body. What happened to Rei?_  
美里，还有律子。他们成功了……啊，真好。这是哪里？我在哪儿，为什么动不了？我感受不到大部分身体。丽怎么了？

"Thank you," Ayanami whispered, as if to reply. "I had thought… that he would be lost."  
"谢谢你，" 绫波轻声说道，仿佛是在回应。"我曾以为……他会迷失。"

"Not on my watch." "休想在我眼皮底下发生。"

_Asuka!  明日香！_

"Toji did a great job," Misato added. "I never expected that guy of all people to become such a competent doctor."  
“冬二做得真不错，”美里补充道，“我从没想过那家伙会成为这么能干的医生。”

"So the Captain underestimated someone's potential? Color me surprised." Asuka's voice was quiet, but combative. "Isn't that what you always do?"  
“所以队长低估了某人的潜力？真让我意外。”明日香的声音虽轻，却带着挑衅，“这不是你一贯的作风吗？”

"Ladies, please. Not again. I still have a headache from your last argument literally two seconds ago," Ritsuko said in a tone that brooked no argument. "And now I am bereft, forsaken, left with half a miserable cigarette to ease my nerves. So, how about a little quiet time? Patient needs his rest and all that."  
“女士们，拜托了。别再吵了。你们上次的争执让我到现在还头疼，真的就两秒钟前的事，”律子用一种不容反驳的语气说道，“而现在我只剩下半支可怜的烟来安抚我的神经。所以，能不能稍微安静一会儿？病人需要休息，不是吗？”

_No! Wait! I want to know what happened! Am I alive? I was bleeding! Hello?  
“不！等等！我想知道发生了什么！我还活着吗？我流血了！有人吗？”_

"When is he waking up?" Asuka demanded. "It's been three days."  
“他什么时候醒？”明日香质问道，“已经三天了。”

"It's been three and a half days," Misato corrected. "He hit his head really hard, and was impaled through the Entry Plug. It's gonna take a little longer than this for Shin-"  
"已经过去三天半了，" 美里纠正道。"他头部受到了重击，还被贯穿了插入栓。要让真嗣恢复，需要的时间可不止这么点……"

"Will you shut it?" Asuka hissed. "His eyes are moving, look! Hey, idiot. Can you hear me? Hey. It's me, do you remember me? Nod for yes."  
"你能不能闭嘴？" 明日香低声呵斥。"他的眼睛在动，看！嘿，笨蛋。你能听到我吗？嘿。是我，你还记得我吗？点头表示记得。"

Happiness filled his being. Shinji's tried to move his head or smile, and whichever wonderful drug had been blocking his pain receptors chose to stop working in that moment. His midsection and leg burned with white- hot agony that made him want to scream louder than he ever had. All he managed was a half-choked squeak. The world faded to blissful emptiness again.  
幸福感充盈着他的身心。真嗣试图移动头部或微笑，而那神奇的药物恰好在那一刻停止了对痛觉神经的阻断。他的腹部和腿部燃烧着白热的剧痛，让他想要尖叫，比以往任何时候都要响亮。他所能发出的只是半窒息的呜咽声。世界再次陷入了令人陶醉的空虚之中。

The next time Shinji regained consciousness it was the middle of the night. He had been blessed enough to not be drugged into a coma, so he allowed himself a proper groan of discomfort. He could move, but the pain radiating from his wounds kept him rooted to the mattress. He recognized the room; Toji had cleaned his wrist there before. The faint beep of a heart rate monitor echoed to his right, and light breathing to his left drew Shinji's eyes to his arm.  
下一次真嗣恢复意识时，已是深夜。幸运的是，他没有被药物弄得昏迷不醒，于是他允许自己发出一声适当的呻吟以示不适。他可以移动，但伤口传来的疼痛让他牢牢固定在床垫上。他认出了这个房间；之前也曾在这里清洗过手腕。心率监测器的微弱哔声从右侧传来，左侧轻柔的呼吸声吸引了真嗣的目光。

Asuka was sleeping beside his bed. She sat on a chair in what must have been a horribly uncomfortable position, with the tracksuit top Toji had gifted him draped over her shoulders. Neither eye-patch nor lustrous crimson fringe obstructed her features for once. Moonlight illuminated her face perfectly, so he drank in the sight of her unbothered expression.  
明日香正睡在他的床边。她坐在一把椅子上，姿势肯定非常不舒服，身上披着 Toji 送给他的运动衫。这一次，既没有眼罩也没有她那艳丽的红色刘海遮挡她的面容。月光完美地照亮了她的脸庞，他尽情地欣赏着她无忧无虑的表情。

_Peaceful,_ he thought. _She looks so relaxed, even sitting in that chair like that._ _Not a single wrinkle of worry._ An exhausted, agonizing chuckle escaped his lips. _Well, maybe some rings under her eyes, but that's understandable_ _after fourteen years of no rest._ _I wonder if she's dreaming of something… boring._  
平静，他心想。她看起来如此放松，即使坐在那样的椅子上。没有一丝忧虑的皱纹。他疲惫而痛苦地轻笑出声。好吧，也许眼底有些黑眼圈，但经历了十四年无休止的生活，这也在情理之中。不知道她是否梦见了什么……无聊的事情。

After what felt like hours Shinji noticed the headphones secured in her ears, and the SDAT resting on her lap. The device had some tape around it, but otherwise looked functional. More relief flooded his senses, forcing a sigh out of him that ended in a rather loud hiss. However, Asuka slept soundly enough to not be bothered.  
仿佛过了几个小时，真嗣才注意到她耳朵里塞着的耳机，以及她腿上的 SDAT 播放器。设备上缠了一些胶带，但看起来还能用。更多的宽慰涌上心头，迫使他叹出一口气，最终化作一声相当响亮的嘶声。然而，明日香睡得足够沉，并未被惊扰。

Noticing Sakura enter the room, Shinji forced his voice to work. "Hey," he rasped. His right forefinger shakily made its way to his lips. "Shh. She's sleeping."  
看到樱走进房间，真嗣努力让声音恢复正常。“嘿，”他沙哑地说道。他的右手食指颤抖着移到唇边。“嘘。她在睡觉。”

Sakura's hands flew to her mouth to stifle a scream of surprise. The tray she had been carrying crashed to the ground, and still Asuka did not wake. Another machine beeped on Shinji's right, and the pain dissipated along with his ability to keep his eyes open.  
樱的双手飞快地捂住嘴巴，试图压抑住惊叫。她手中的托盘砰然落地，而明日香依然没有醒来。真嗣右侧的另一台机器发出哔哔声，疼痛随之消散，他的眼皮也支撑不住了。

"Shinji? Do you know who that is?" Sakura quietly inquired. "Do you know who I am, or where you are? Shinji…?"  
"真嗣？你知道那是谁吗？" 樱轻声询问。"你知道我是谁，或者你现在在哪里吗？真嗣……？"

---

The third time he woke, Shinji was lucid, albeit in horrible pain as Sakura and Toji changed his bandages.  
第三次醒来时，真嗣神志清醒，尽管在樱和东治为他更换绷带时痛苦不堪。

He was prodded with needles and questions by Ritsuko, who insisted on hearing every last detail of their encounter for some reason. It was that day that Shinji learned their efforts had made an actual difference. Most survivors had been more than eager to help former neighbors, family members and complete strangers get reacquainted with reality. Misato came in soon after and gave him the gentlest bear hug imaginable, promising to embrace him properly once he was healthy again. She looked exhausted and grief-stricken, but sincerely glad to see him conscious.  
他被律子用针扎和提问折腾了一番，律子不知为何坚持要听他们遭遇的每一个细节。就在那天，真嗣得知他们的努力确实产生了影响。大多数幸存者都非常乐意帮助以前的邻居、家人和完全陌生的人重新适应现实。之后不久，美里走了进来，给了他一个想象中最温柔的拥抱，承诺等他康复后再好好拥抱他。她看起来疲惫不堪，悲痛欲绝，但看到他清醒过来，真心感到高兴。

Two metal rods in his lower abdomen and thigh had almost anchored him to the Entry Plug. Shinji flinched as Ritsuko eagerly recalled having to use industrial construction tools to pry him free. There was no neural damage to his leg, and only a small section of his lower intestine had been pierced. The bullet wound ended up being the least threatening of his injuries. Regardless, a full recovery was expected in three months, granted that he did not escape physical therapy.  
他下腹部和大腿上的两根金属棒几乎将他固定在了插入栓内。当律子热切地回忆起不得不使用工业建筑工具将他解救出来的情景时，真嗣不禁打了个寒颤。他的腿部没有神经损伤，只有一小段下肠被刺穿。子弹伤口反而是他伤势中最不具威胁的。尽管如此，预计三个月内可以完全康复，前提是他不逃避物理治疗。

By the time all the examinations had been done, Shinji's head was left spinning, and his energy depleted. Hunger had returned with a vengeance, and so had the need for rest, to his relief. Sakura had been only too happy to inform him that his body was aging normally. The curse of Eva was no more.  
所有检查完成后，真嗣的头脑一片混乱，精力耗尽。饥饿感如猛兽般回归，休息的需求也让他松了一口气。樱非常高兴地告诉他，他的身体正在正常老化。EVA 的诅咒已不复存在。

Meeting Rei was awkward. She sat to his left, long hair tied in a ponytail and eyes glued to the floor.  
与绫波见面时气氛有些尴尬。她坐在他的左边，长发束成马尾，目光紧盯着地板。

"I, uhm, like the new style," he whispered after minutes of uncomfortable silence. "It suits you very well."  
"呃，我喜欢这个新风格，"他在几分钟的不自在沉默后低声说道，"它非常适合你。"

"Thank you," Rei replied, blushing. "I was… advised to also show my gratitude for your efforts in saving me. Fourteen years ago, and again, a week ago. I am truly grateful."  
"谢谢，"丽回复道，脸颊泛红。"我被建议……也表达对你救我的感激之情。十四年前，还有一周前。我真的很感激。"

"No need to thank me for any of that," he said. "I'm glad you're safe. Sorry about the whole… fourteen year long nap."  
"不必为那些事谢我，"他说，"我很高兴你平安无事。关于那个……长达十四年的沉睡，我很抱歉。"

"I've heard the world was rather inhospitable during those years, so in a way, it was a favor," Rei stated. Her voice sounded more natural, Shinji noticed. More relaxed. "I did not want you to be forced into the position of pilot again. I failed."  
"那些年月里，世界相当不友好，所以某种程度上，这算是一种恩惠，" 丽说道。她的声音听起来更自然了，真嗣注意到。更放松了。"我不想让你再次被迫成为驾驶员。我失败了。"

"Heh, Asuka said I wasn't half-bad at piloting when I wasn't throwing a hissy fit. Or at least, that I could be." Shinji shook his head and smiled at his newfound sibling. "You were trying to protect me. Thank you, Ayan-uhm, Rei. I guess it was inevitable in a way. I'm just happy things turned out for the best. Do you know how the housing project is going?"  
"嘿，明日香说我发脾气的时候不算太糟。或者说，我可以变得更好。" 真嗣摇了摇头，对着新认的姐姐微笑。"你是在试图保护我。谢谢你，绫波...呃，丽。我想这在某种程度上是不可避免的。我只是很高兴事情最终变得最好。你知道住房项目进展如何吗？"

Rei smiled as well. "You should concern yourself with your health first, Shinji," she remarked with a slightly authoritative tone. "But he project is going well; more than ten new houses have been constructed. Much of the infrastructure buried under the core remnants is in remarkably good shape, so rebuilding efforts have quickly borne fruit. I have-" She paused, cheeks turning redder. "I have planted fifteen rows of rice. It is hard, but rewarding labor, and simple enough for someone as clumsy as I."  
丽也笑了。"你应该先关心自己的健康，真嗣，" 她带着一丝权威的语气说道。"但项目进展顺利；已经建成了十多栋新房子。埋在核心残骸下的许多基础设施状况出奇地好，所以重建工作迅速取得了成果。我..." 她停顿了一下，脸颊变得更红了。"我种了十五行稻米。虽然辛苦，但回报丰厚，而且对于我这样笨手笨脚的人来说，也足够简单。"

_Rei,_ Shinji thought, recalling how eager she had been to see the harvest. _I heard the fields are mostly intact, so I'll go count the crops as soon as I'm able, and make sure yours are safe._  
丽，真嗣想着，回忆起她对收获季节的渴望。我听说田地大多完好无损，所以一旦我能行动，就会去清点庄稼，确保你的那份安全。

"Don't strain yourself too much." He found himself repeating the phrase the entire village had ground into his brain for nigh on a month. "It tends to be very humid in the fields, and the sun in the mornings is hard on the skin. Remember to wear a hat, please. And keep yourself hydrated."  
“别太勉强自己。”他发现自己重复着整个村子近一个月来不断灌输给他的话。“田里通常很潮湿，早晨的阳光对皮肤伤害很大。记得戴帽子，请保持水分补充。”

"Ryoji ensures I am well looked after," Rei commented in a whisper. "He brings refreshments to the workers in the afternoon. He says the same phrase every day."  
“阿光确保我被照顾得很好，”丽低声评论道，“他下午会给工人们送饮料。他每天都说同样的话。”

"Drink your lemonade," Shinji said. Sadness needled his heart. "It's good for you."  
"喝你的柠檬水，" 真嗣说道。悲伤刺痛了他的心。"这对你有好处。"

"Yes, how did you kn-oh. Hello," Rei rose from the chair and offered a slight nod, eyes turning stern. "Has Captain Katsuragi called me in?"  
"是的，你怎么知道——哦。你好，" 绫波从椅子上站起来，微微点头，眼神变得严肃。"葛城舰长叫我来的吗？"

Shinji followed Rei's gaze and almost choked on his breath.  
真嗣顺着绫波的目光看去，差点被自己的呼吸呛到。

Asuka stood by the door with her arms crossed. "For the fourth time, Misato's not a captain, anymore," she state flatly, shrugging. "There's no ship left for her to steer left, remember? But yeah, she needed to talk you about something regarding rice and a kitchen."  
明日香双臂交叉站在门口。“第四次了，美里已经不是舰长了，”她平淡地陈述，耸了耸肩。“没有船让她掌舵了，记得吗？不过，她确实需要和你谈谈关于米和厨房的事。”

"A kitchen?" Rei's dangerous edge disappeared. She approached Shinji's bed and gently patted his left hand with both of hers. "I wish you a swift and complete recovery. It was good to see you, and… converse with you. May I come again tomorrow?"  
“厨房？”绫波的危险气息消失了。她走近真嗣的床边，温柔地用双手轻拍他的左手。“祝你早日康复。很高兴见到你，并且……与你交谈。明天我可以再来吗？”

"Of course, Rei," he replied, stifling a cough. "I'd be happy to talk to you every day."  
“当然，绫波，”他回答，强忍着咳嗽。“我很乐意每天和你聊天。”

"Would you, now?" Asuka interjected. She pushed herself off the door frame and walked over to them. "You spent the better part of a month basically mute, and now you can't wait to talk your heart out with Ayanami. What a coincidence."  
"哦，是吗？" 明日香插话道。她从门框上起身，走向他们。"你之前几乎一个月都没怎么说话，现在却迫不及待地想和绫波聊个不停。真是巧啊。"

"Hi," said Shinji. The blanket covering his legs suddenly turned fascinating. "I wasn't doing well back then."  
"嗨，" 真嗣说道。盖在腿上的毯子突然变得引人入胜。"那时候我状态不好。"

"And you do not enjoy the company of strangers, especially _loud_ ones," Rei said. "Good night, Shinji. I will see you tomorrow."  
"而且你不喜欢陌生人的陪伴，尤其是吵闹的那些，" 绫波说。"晚安，真嗣。明天见。"

Shinji gulped and suppressed a shudder. The temperature was chilly, and the clothes Ritsuko had provided offered little protection against the breeze. No sooner did the second tremor force a hiss out of him, did Asuka march to the nearest cabinet and produce her red jacket, a heavier blanket and another smaller garment he did not quite recognize. She stomped her way to his bed and extended the jacket, rolling her eyes after he failed to react.  
真嗣咽了口唾沫，强忍住颤抖。气温有些寒冷，而律子提供的衣物对抵御微风几乎无济于事。第二次震颤迫使他倒吸一口凉气，随即明日香大步走向最近的柜子，拿出她的红色夹克、一条更厚实的毯子，还有一件他不太认得的小衣物。她气势汹汹地走到他的床边，递出夹克，见他毫无反应，便翻了个白眼。

"Stretch out your arms." Asuka ground out. "That hole in your gut will make even putting this on torture. Believe that. Move it, you're making me look stupid."  
“伸出手臂。”明日香咬牙切齿地说道，“你腹部的伤口会让穿这件衣服都变成折磨。相信我。快点，你让我看起来很蠢。”

Nodding, Shinji did as he was told and tried not to flinch. The garment felt almost as comforting as Misato's embrace had been, and vanquished the cold in seconds. Asuka's face came dangerously close to his, so close that her breath tickled his neck. She stopped in her tracks, and the both of them froze, staring deeply into each other's eyes.  
真嗣点点头，照做了，尽量不露出痛苦的表情。这件衣物带来的安慰几乎和美里拥抱时一样，几秒钟内就驱散了寒冷。明日香的脸危险地靠近他的，近到她的呼吸拂过他的脖子。她停下脚步，两人都僵住了，深深地凝视着对方的眼睛。

"Uhm, hi," he repeated. "How did you… I thought this was ashes at best."  
"呃，嗨，"他又重复了一遍。"你怎么做到的……我以为这最多只能剩下灰烬。"

"Leave it to Four-eyes and her recruit to do 'impossible things'," Asuka elucidated, breaking out of whatever trance they had been in. "That lame dictionary of yours and most of her books made it, as well."  
"交给四眼和她的小跟班去做'不可能的事'吧，"明日香解释道，从他们刚才的恍惚状态中回过神来。"你那本破字典和她的书大部分都保存下来了。"

"Oh! Is Miss Mari okay?" Shinji asked. "I haven't seen her."  
"哦！玛丽小姐还好吗？"真嗣问道。"我还没见到她。"

"She's on sabbatical. Left for her homeland or whatever," Asuka said. "Say her name enough times and she'll land on the lawn before you can count your blessings, though."  
"她正在休假。回她的故乡去了，或者别的什么地方，" 明日香说。"只要多念几遍她的名字，她就会在你还没来得及感谢之前，降落在草坪上。"

They shared a small laugh, one that took Shinji by surprise.  
他们一起轻声笑了，这让真嗣感到意外。

_Did she just… was_ _t__hat a joke? And sincere laughter?_ _Now I know for a fact my father won._  
她刚刚是……在开玩笑吗？还是真心的笑声？现在我确信无疑，我父亲赢了。

"I'm really glad to see you," Shinji admitted after the silence stretched. "You look… very well rested."  
"见到你我真的很高兴，" 沉默拉长后，真嗣坦白道，"你看起来……非常精神。"

"Yeah, I've been sleeping a lot these past few days. Like a certain someone," she said, gaze narrowing. Shinji's eyes widened upon recognizing the cap in her hand. "A certain someone who was about to die from blood loss a few days ago without my permission to do so."  
"是啊，这几天我一直在睡觉。就像某个家伙一样，" 她目光一紧，说道。真嗣看到她手中的帽子，眼睛顿时睁大了。"某个家伙，几天前未经我允许就差点因为失血过多而死。"

Asuka stiffly placed the cap atop his head in the same fashion she had the day he collapsed in the village._That hug felt really nice,_ his mind whispered. _I'd like another one. Or two. Or two hundred._ "I thought it was torn to shreds," he said instead. "Was this also some impossible thing?"  
明日香僵硬地将帽子戴在他的头上，就像他那天在村子里倒下时她所做的那样。那个拥抱感觉真的很棒，他的内心低语着。我想要再来一个。或者两个。或者两百个。"我以为它已经被撕成碎片了，" 他改口道，"这也是某种不可能的事情吗？"

"Nah. I told you it wasn't a big deal. I have a few of those lying around," Asuka explained, pointing to his head. She sat where Rei had been before, arms crossed. "You don't want to grow up, huh. That's something a brat would say."  
"不，我告诉过你这没什么大不了的。我脑子里有几件这样的事，" 明日香解释道，指了指自己的头。她坐在之前绫波所在的位置，双臂交叉。"你不想长大，是吧。这是小孩子才会说的话。"

Shinji used the hat to somewhat hide his face. "Is it really so awful to be a brat?" he wondered. Asuka's smirk broadened. "I don't think I ever had the chance to be one. Well, aside from my 'vacations' from reality."  
真嗣用帽子稍微遮住了自己的脸。"做个小孩子真的那么糟糕吗？" 他疑惑道。明日香的笑容更甚。"我想我从未有机会当个孩子。嗯，除了我脱离现实的'假期'之外。"

"The proper term is shell-shocked." Asuka drew her chair a tad closer to the bed. "Now that you mention it, doing bratty stuff might not be so awful." Her gaze shifted to Shinji's midsection and leg. "So long as it doesn't involve getting impaled, or turning the world into a barren wasteland. Not bad, by the way."  
"正确的说法是创伤后应激障碍。" 明日香将椅子稍微挪近床边。"既然你提到了，做些孩子气的事也许没那么糟糕。" 她的目光转向真嗣的腹部和腿。"只要不涉及被刺穿，或者把世界变成荒芜之地就行。顺便说一句，这还不错。"

"Hmm?" Shinji's head perked up. "What's not bad?"  
“嗯？” 真嗣的头抬了起来。“什么不错？”

"Your dumb wish." Asuka pointed to the window behind her. "Fertile lands all over, even after fourteen years of no water or sunlight. Wild animals reconquering old forest areas. Migratory birds came back two days ago." She shrugged again. "Overall not the worst wish one could have made, considering you could have just erased and rewritten reality along with our memories. Lots of people everybody signed off as dead have returned. Food is scarce, but available. Not bad, idiot."  
“你的傻愿望。” 明日香指向她身后的窗户。“到处都是肥沃的土地，即使经过了十四年没有水或阳光的日子。野生动物重新占领了古老的森林区域。候鸟两天前回来了。” 她再次耸肩。“总的来说，考虑到你本可以抹去并重写现实以及我们的记忆，这愿望不算最糟。许多被认定死亡的人都回来了。食物稀缺，但还能找到。不算坏，傻瓜。”

_A compliment?_ Shini's heartbeat increased. _She likes this world?_  
这是在夸我吗？真嗣的心跳加速了。她喜欢这个世界吗？

"Thank you," he said, fighting against any hesitation or stammering. "You… no longer have to protect this place. Would you like to, uhm..." Noticing Asuka's gaze becoming increasingly annoyed, Shinji took a deep, painful breath and settled the chaos in his mind. "I'd like to live here. I'd like to help rebuild. Cook, clean, cut wood, plant trees, harvest crops, whatever the village might need of me. There's still so much I have to atone for, but… I wouldn't mind the hard work if you're, uhm, here."  
"“谢谢你，”他努力克制着犹豫和结巴，说道，“你……不再需要保护这个地方了。你愿意，呃……”注意到明日香的眼神越来越不耐烦，真嗣深吸了一口气，强忍痛苦，平复内心的混乱。“我想住在这里。我想帮忙重建。做饭、打扫、砍柴、种树、收割庄稼，无论村子需要我做什么。我还有很多需要赎罪的地方，但……如果你在这里，我不介意辛苦工作。”

"Not the place I live in, but the place I protect," Asuka murmured. Her hand prodded around the healed eye. "See, that last thing you said wasn't bratty at all. It's not like I have anywhere else to go," she carried on, feigning nonchalance. "Living under Ken-Ken's roof is getting annoying, though. I hate owing favors."  
"“不是我居住的地方，而是我守护的地方。”明日香喃喃自语，手指轻触着已愈合的眼眶。“看，你最后那句话一点也不孩子气。我也没有其他地方可去，”她继续说道，假装满不在乎，“住在剑剑的屋檐下越来越烦人了。我不喜欢欠人情。”

_I'll build you a house. Pick the spot and I'll learn to raise it up with my bare hands. Somewhere you can be bored and glare at the food, somewhere you can call home, and sleep for days if you wish.  
"“我会为你建一座房子。选个地方，我会学会用双手把它建起来。一个你可以无聊发呆、挑剔食物的地方，一个你可以称之为家、想睡多久就睡多久的地方。”_

"Hey." Asuka's voice cut through his dream of a terrace that overlooked both the hills and the ocean. "The hell are you thinking about? You had this goofy little smile just now."  
“嘿。”明日香的声音划破了他梦中的露台，那露台俯瞰着山丘与海洋。“你在想什么呢？刚才你脸上挂着那种傻乎乎的微笑。”

"Boring stuff." “无聊的事。”

The words came naturally, as though whispered by a smiling Viko. Asuka was slightly taken aback, but recovered in seconds and playfully tugged down his hat. There was something different about her, as though the eye-patch had not been simply blocking her eye, but most of her emotions as well. Speaking with her was easy, it occurred naturally instead of being forced like before. The silence between them no longer felt constrained by guilt, resentment or uncertainty.  
这些话自然而然地流出，仿佛是微笑的维克在耳边低语。明日香稍感意外，但几秒内便恢复过来，俏皮地拉低了他的帽子。她似乎有些不同，仿佛那眼罩不仅遮住了她的眼睛，还遮住了她大部分的情感。与她交谈变得轻松，自然而然地发生，不再像以前那样勉强。他们之间的沉默不再被愧疚、怨恨或不确定所束缚。

"Speaking of boring, you'll be glad to hear your Idiot Tree only lost four leaves throughout the entire 'battle for humanity's survival'." Asuka said after a few moments. "The Katsuragi spawn insists it'll make a full recovery in no time, like its name-sake." She nodded at him. "Heard you saying you want to go back to work soon? Not happening. You'll do as the jock says until that blonde harpy gives the green light. Then, and only then, will you be allowed to move without supervision. Are we clear?"  
"说到无聊，你听了会高兴的——你的那棵笨树在整个‘人类生存之战’中只掉了四片叶子。" 过了一会儿，明日香说道，"葛城家的那个小鬼坚持说它很快就会完全恢复，就像它的名字一样。" 她向他点了点头，"听说你最近想回去工作？不可能。你得听那个运动员的话，直到那个金发泼妇给你开绿灯。只有到那时，你才能在没有监督的情况下自由行动。明白了吗？"

"Clear as the creek, Major," Shinji responded. He chuckled after Asuka tugged on his cap once more. "Sorry about the whole 'close to death' thing. I might have misunderstood a bit of our… last conversation."  
"清澈如溪流，少校，" 真嗣回答道。在明日香再次拽了拽他的帽子后，他轻声笑了起来，"关于那次'差点丧命'的事，我很抱歉。我可能误解了我们……最后一次谈话的一些内容。"

Asuka raised a skeptical eyebrow. "Oh, _really_?" she hissed. "Misunderstood, you say? What part of 'bring it back' could you have possibly _misunderstood_, you idiot?"  
明日香挑起了一边眉毛，带着怀疑的神情。"哦，真的吗？" 她低声说道，"你说你误解了？'带它回来'这句话，你到底能误解什么，你这个笨蛋？"

"But I did bring it back! I thought that was the point!" Shinji tried to raise his voice as well, only for his abdomen and leg to reprimand him worse than Asuka's glare. "It was in my hand. That's the last thing I remember."  
"但我确实把它带回来了！我以为这才是重点！" 真嗣试图提高声音，却换来腹部和腿部的剧痛，比明日香的瞪视还要严厉。"它在我手里。那是我最后的记忆。"

"The point was to return in one piece and give the stupid roundel back to me, Idiot!" Asuka's voice thundered through the room. She had risen to her feet; however, the anger faded from her eyes as soon as it had arrived. "Which is exactly what you did, I suppose."  
"重点是完好无损地回来，然后把那个愚蠢的圆徽还给我，笨蛋！" 明日香的声音响彻房间。她站了起来；然而，怒火在她眼中一闪即逝。"我想，这正是你所做的。"

_Technically I didn't lose any limbs,_ Shinji thought._Toji and Ritsuko said my leg'__s gonna be okay. My side hurts, but I can hobble well enough to and from the bathroom._ _Wait, so that wasn't a dream? Red hair. I saw it._  
从技术上讲，我没有失去任何肢体，真嗣心想。 冬二和律子说我的腿会没事的。我的侧腹疼痛，但足以一瘸一拐地进出洗手间。等等，那不是梦吗？红色的头发。我看到了。

"I did?" he asked without realizing. He looked at his palm, recalling the nigh-imperceptible weight of the roundel. "I saw... something before I passed out, but I thought it was a dream, or some hallucination."  
“我做了？”他未曾察觉地问道。他看着自己的手掌，回想起那圆盘几乎难以察觉的重量。“我昏过去之前看到了……一些东西，但我以为那是个梦，或者是某种幻觉。”

"No dream, idiot." Asuka's expression grew troubled. "I was the first to reach the crash site. You were still half-conscious, but way beyond feeling anything below the neck, or making any sense." Shinji's mind went blank when she held up the pirate insignia between her thumb and forefinger. "At first, you wouldn't let go of it, but then you half-recognized me and," she turned away. "You had the stupidest smile I've ever seen."  
“不是梦，傻瓜。”明日香的表情变得忧虑。“我是第一个到达坠机现场的。你那时还半清醒，但下半身已经毫无知觉，说话也语无伦次。”当她用拇指和食指夹起那个海盗徽章时，真嗣的思绪一片空白。“起初，你紧紧抓着它不放，但后来你半认出了我，然后，”她转过身去。“你露出了我见过的最愚蠢的笑容。”

"Sorr-uhm. I didn't mean for you to see me in that state." He spoke carefully, not wishing to ignite more of Asuka's ire. "If I could have done anything to prevent it, I would have."  
“对不——呃，我不是有意让你看到我那副样子的。”他小心翼翼地说，不想再激起明日香的怒火。“如果我能做些什么来避免这种情况，我一定会做的。”

"Ayanami says you were out like a light after the sync with Unit 01 was cut off," Asuka offered. Her eyes inspected the roundel's insignia with ferocious scrutiny. "Whatever power was in Unit 01 escorted you both to the village. It's not your fault some vengeful little bastards tried to blast you out of the skies."  
“绫波说，你和 01 号机断开同步后就像灯灭了一样昏过去了，”明日香说道。她的目光带着凶猛的审视，仔细打量着圆形徽章上的标志。“无论 01 号机里有什么力量，它都护送你们到了村子。那些心怀怨恨的小混蛋试图把你从空中击落，这不是你的错。”

_Oh, so that's what happened._ Shinji's shoulder dropped as pain unrelated to the wounds spread through his chest._They did say no matter what I did, they wouldn't forgive me. That's okay._  
哦，原来是这样。真嗣的肩膀因与伤口无关的疼痛而下垂，疼痛蔓延至他的胸口。他们确实说过，无论我做什么，他们都不会原谅我。没关系。

"Please don't hurt them," he said. "Maybe they did some… bad things, but they had every reason to hate me. It's my fault t-"  
“请不要伤害他们，”他说。“也许他们做了一些……坏事，但他们有充分的理由恨我。这都是我的错——”

"Ugh," Asuka interjected. "Stop it with the 'it's my fault' crap. Look out your window, look at the moon!" she ordered. Shinji straightened up and did as instructed. "It's not ridden with bloody crosses, is it? The hills are green, the air doesn't smell like blood. The ocean water isn't red, or toxic for all life forms. They can stick their grudges straight up-" She halted, then sighed derisively. "The spawn told us you'd be completely against any sort of bodily punishment, so they're on plant duty for the foreseeable future."  
"呃，" 明日香插话道，"别再扯什么'都是我的错'这种废话了。看看窗外，看看月亮！"她命令道。真嗣挺直身子，照做了。"月亮上没有布满血腥的十字架，对吧？山峦依旧青翠，空气中没有血腥味。海水不是红色的，也没有毒害所有生物。他们那些怨恨就让他们自己留着吧——"她顿了顿，然后轻蔑地叹了口气，"那小鬼告诉我们，你绝对反对任何形式的体罚，所以他们接下来一段时间都得负责种植物了。"

Shinji realized Ryoji had not yet visited. "How are the brat trees doing?" he started. "Have you seen Ryoji lately? Is he alright?"  
真嗣意识到六道还没来过。"那些小树苗怎么样了？"他开口问道，"你最近见过六道吗？他没事吧？"

"Brats are fine. Couple of broken twigs, but they'll survive." Asuka replied. "Katsuragi is doing as well as you can expect. He keeps a good enough façade around the villagers and crew. I notice, though, so that means everybody else does. He's trying to do everything Viko used to do, plus his own duties to he doesn't think about… you know, his brother not being here, anymore."  
"小树苗挺好的。有几根断枝，但它们会挺过去的。"明日香回答，"葛城表现得和你预期的一样好。他在村民和船员面前保持着良好的形象。不过我注意到了，这意味着其他人也注意到了。他试图做维科以前做的所有事，再加上他自己的职责，这样他就不会去想……你知道的，他的兄弟不再在这里了。"

Viko grinned in his memory, and pushed a bottle of fresh lemonade forward. As far as everybody knew, the blonde had been one of the few casualties the battle had left behind. No amount of core energy had sufficed to retrieve his soul; his sacrifice had brought upon the spear of Gaius. The villagers were waiting for Shinji to recover in order to hold a wake and burial ceremony.  
Viko 在他的记忆中咧嘴笑了，推过来一瓶新鲜的柠檬水。据大家所知，这位金发男子是战斗中留下的少数伤亡之一。无论多少核心能量都无法召回他的灵魂；他的牺牲带来了 Gaius 之矛。村民们正等待 Shinji 康复，以便举行追悼和葬礼仪式。

"Everyone feels his absence, I bet," Shinji uttered. Despite the grief, he could not help but smile upon recalling the extravagant man. "He did so much for so many people, and never asked much in return. Only plant duty."  
“我敢说，每个人都感受到了他的缺席，”Shinji 说道。尽管悲伤，他还是忍不住微笑，回想起那位豪放不羁的人。“他为那么多人做了那么多事，却从不求回报。只要求照料植物。”

"That, or to sit and hear him drone on about botany, or the meaning of dreams, or how little steps add up in the end," Asuka added. Her smirk returned. "Heh, goofball. He wasn't that terrible a singer, either."  
“或者坐下来听他喋喋不休地谈论植物学、梦境的意义，或是小步骤最终如何累积成大成就，”Asuka 补充道。她的坏笑又回来了。“嘿，傻瓜。他的歌声也没那么糟糕。”

"Good guitar player, as well. It always felt like he was teaching you something whenever he told a story. He was a great listener, too."  
"吉他弹得也很好。每次他讲故事的时候，总感觉他在教你什么。他也是个很好的倾听者。"

"Yeah." Asuka stretched her legs and placed them on his mattress. Her feet touched his ankle. "Who ever thought I'd miss his dumb ramblings, or serenades in the middle of the night?"  
"是啊。" 明日香伸直双腿，放在他的床垫上。她的脚碰到了他的脚踝。"谁会想到我会想念他那些愚蠢的唠叨，或是深夜里的即兴演奏呢？"

Again, they laughed, so hard this time that Shinji's wound flared and he grunted. Asuka was beside him instantly. "I-I'm fine," he managed. "Just a little jolt. Nothing serious."  
他们再次大笑，这次笑得如此厉害，以至于真嗣的伤口发作，他哼了一声。明日香立刻在他身边。"我-我没事，"他勉强说道。"只是有点震动。没什么大不了的。"

"Uh huh." Asuka pointed to the gown, ignoring Shinji's words altogether. "No bleeding. Good. Now." She rummaged through the jacket pocket and produced two protein bars. "Eat."  
“嗯哼。”明日香指着长袍，完全无视了真嗣的话。“没有流血。很好。现在。”她翻找着夹克口袋，掏出两根蛋白棒。“吃吧。”

A simple word, a command she had instilled in him from that moment in the cell now felt akin to a greeting. Shinji eagerly devoured his ration, and was excited to see Asuka nibble on hers with the shadow of hunger in her eyes. The blue of her irises glistened in the moonlight, making her look all the more beautiful to him.  
一个简单的词，一个从那时在牢房里就深深烙印在他心中的命令，如今感觉就像一句问候。真嗣急切地吞咽着配给的食物，看到明日香也咬着她的那份，眼中隐约闪现着饥饿的影子，他感到兴奋。月光下，她蓝色的虹膜闪烁着光芒，使她在他眼中显得更加美丽。

_Take the leap,_ Viko whispered in his ear. _Your feet carried you here, step by step. Time to jump, Shinji._  
跳吧，维科在他耳边低语。你的脚步一步步带你来到这里。是时候跳跃了，真嗣。

"I did as you told me," Shinji said. Asuka's gaze fixed on him, so he took a measured breath to steel himself and extended his hand in her direction. "Can I have my roundel now? I really like it. If there's something else I need to do to earn it, tell me what it is and I'll do it."  
“我按照你说的做了，”真嗣说道。明日香的目光紧紧锁定在他身上，于是他深吸一口气，鼓起勇气，向她伸出手。“我现在可以拿回我的圆形徽章了吗？我真的很喜欢它。如果还有什么需要我做的才能得到它，告诉我是什么，我会去做的。”

Surprised, Asuka stared at him for a long time before shaking her head in faux annoyance. "You and your little medals. Fine. Just don't lose it."  
明日香惊讶地盯着他看了很久，然后假装不耐烦地摇了摇头。“你和你那些小勋章。好吧。只是别弄丢了。”

The cold metal was a stark contrast to Asuka's warm skin as it grazed his palm. "I won't. Promise." His fingers intertwined with hers when Asuka withdrew her hand. "Could you… stay a little longer? It's still kind of hard to believe all this, and it's been a bit difficult to fall asleep."  
冰冷的金属与明日香温暖的肌肤形成鲜明对比，当它擦过他的手掌时。“我不会的。我保证。”在明日香收回手时，他的手指与她的交缠在一起。“你能……再多待一会儿吗？这一切还是有点难以置信，而且最近有点难以入睡。”

"I'm on guard duty, anyway," she quietly replied. Instead of retrieving her hand and berating him, Asuka came closer and placed her head next to his arm. "Give me one of those pillows. I'm not sleeping on this chair again. Last time my back was killing me all day long."  
"反正我也在站岗。"她轻声回答。没有抽回手或责备他，明日香反而靠近了些，将头靠在他的手臂旁。"给我一个枕头。我再也不想睡在这椅子上了。上次我的背疼了一整天。"

"Yeah, it definitely didn't look comfortable." Viko spat out his lemonade in Shinji's mind. _No, no, no no! Backpedal! Wait!_ "But you were so at ease, even sitting like that. So pretty," he said dreamily, not noticing the temperature of the room drop, or Asuka's gaze shine with something other than moonlight. "I wanted to get you a pillow or something, but at the same time, I didn't want to… bother….y-uhm. Did I say something wrong?"  
"是啊，看起来肯定不舒服。"在真嗣的脑海中，Viko 把柠檬水喷了出来。不，不，不不！赶紧圆回来！等等！"但你那样坐着却显得很自在，甚至很美，"他梦幻般地说道，没注意到房间温度的下降，或是明日香眼中闪烁的不仅仅是月光。"我想给你拿个枕头什么的，但同时又不想……打扰……呃。我说错什么了吗？"

"So, you were just watching me sleep?" Asuka growled, so close that he could feel her breathing. "Gross. Don't be a peeping Tom or I'll take that roundel back."  
"所以，你一直在看我睡觉？"明日香低吼道，近到他能感受到她的呼吸。"真恶心。别当偷窥狂，否则我会把那个圆盘要回来。"

"I wasn't!" Shinji argued weakly. His cheeks burned. "I just happened to wake up in the middle of the night and you were here!"  
"我没有！" 真嗣无力地辩解道。他的脸颊发烫。"我只是碰巧半夜醒来，而你就在这里！"

"Isn't watching someone sleep kind of," Asuka snickered, "boring?"  
"看别人睡觉，是不是有点，" 明日香窃笑道，"无聊？"

"When it's someone you care very much about, then yeah," Shinji answered. "Extremely boring."  
"如果是你非常关心的人，那就没错，" 真嗣回答。"极其无聊。"

"Get to it, then," she demanded with a slightly teasing voice, and gently pushed his upper body back to the mattress. "Just because you're injured doesn't mean you're the only one who gets to do boring stuff." Once the pillow had been secured, she half-sat and half-layed on the mattress. "Sweet dreams, Idiot-Shinji."  
"那就开始吧，"她用略带戏谑的语气命令道，并轻轻将他的上半身推回到床垫上。"就算你受伤了，也不代表只有你能做无聊的事。"枕头固定好后，她半坐半躺地靠在床垫上。"做个好梦，笨蛋真嗣。"

And they were indeed sweet. The steady breathing next to him and the warmth radiating through his hand lulled Shinji to unconsciousness with ease, far quicker than any tune from the SDAT had ever managed. The pain of his wounds dissipated under bright sunlight, rose petals dancing in the wind, and red locks caressing his face.  
那一夜的确甜美。他身旁平稳的呼吸声和透过手掌传来的温暖轻易地让真嗣陷入了无意识状态，比 SDAT 播放的任何旋律都要迅速。在明媚的阳光下，伤口的疼痛逐渐消散，玫瑰花瓣在风中起舞，红色的发丝轻抚着他的脸庞。

"I took the leap," he mumbled without realizing. "Hey, Viko…. How did I do?"  
"我跳了下去，"他无意识地喃喃自语。"嘿，Viko…. 我做得怎么样？"

---

"_Terrible."_  "糟糕透顶。"

_Asuka rolled her eye, exhaling in annoyance as the blonde approached. As always, the first thing she noticed was his voice, not his footfalls. "__What's terrible?" she growled. "The fact that_ _I have to stay here and watch over this slobbering brat? I'd have to agree."_  
明日香翻了个白眼，不耐烦地叹了口气，看着金发男子走近。一如既往，她首先注意到的是他的声音，而非脚步声。“什么糟糕？”她咆哮道，“是因为我得留在这里看管这个流口水的白痴吗？我得承认，确实糟糕。”

"_That sounds unpleasant, at best," Viko replied. He sat a few feet_ _a__way from her. "I was talking about what they did to him. Gendo Ikari, SEELE, hell, even the crew, the p__e__ople he's supposed to be fighting for." He shook his head. "How terrible."_  
“听起来顶多算是不愉快，”维克多回答道。他坐在离她几英尺远的地方。“我指的是他们对他的所作所为。碇源堂，SEELE，见鬼，甚至包括船员，那些他本应为之战斗的人们。”他摇了摇头，“真是糟糕透顶。”

"_Boo hoo, poor baby," she snapped back. The black pit of anger and hatred in her belly stirred. "Never mind the fact that he destroyed everything twice and did nothing but help his father and SEELE fulfill whatever selfish crap they intend to accomplish. Poor him, because all he does is mess it up! Poor him, poor Shinji who's the key to the end of humanity! Good freaking riddance. All I do is fight for this… ungrateful, poisoned and corrupt species that created me in a tube, and raised me like an attack dog. Maybe it's_ _f__or the best that they wipe_ _all the Lilin_ _out."_  
"呜呜，可怜的小宝贝，"她厉声回击。腹中那股愤怒与憎恨的黑暗深渊开始翻腾。"别提他两次毁掉一切，除了帮他的父亲和 SEELE 实现他们那些自私的鬼计划外什么都没做。可怜的他，只会把事情搞砸！可怜的他，可怜的 Shinji，人类的末日之钥！见鬼去吧。我所做的一切只是为了这个……不知感恩、中毒且腐败的物种，他们把我像条斗犬一样在试管里创造出来，养大。也许他们把所有人类都消灭掉才是最好的。"

_By the end of her rant, Asuka was panting and on her feet, both hands curled into fists._ _Viko's eyes turned deadly, cold and piercing unlike anything she had seen from the man before. "Do you honestly_ _believe it would be better if all humans stopped existing?"_  
她发泄完时，Asuka 已经气喘吁吁地站了起来，双手紧握成拳。Viko 的眼神变得冷酷无情，锐利如冰，与她之前见过的任何样子都不同。"你真的认为如果所有人类都不存在会更好吗？"

"_I know about your brother and I was there when they found you, so don'__t_ _even bother with this crap, V.K." she retorted_ _between gritted teeth__. "You're gonna sit there and tell me this species isn't cruel?_ _**You**__?"_  
"我知道你哥哥的事，我也在场当他们找到你，所以别再跟我扯这些废话了，V.K。"她咬牙切齿地反驳。"你会坐在那里告诉我这个物种不残忍吗？你？"

"_No." Viko shrugged,_ _ca__t__ching Asuka off guard__. His eyes lost the youthful joy that characterized him. "I've been cruel. It's a cruel world._ _Maybe we_ _are_ _all truly corrupt and deserve to die, but maybe… we could be better, too. If we all end up mixed into one single, gigantic amniotic soup, you might end human cruelty, yes. But… you end human kindness too. No more jokes. No more gifts." He threw a bottle of lemonade to her, which she easily caught. "No more surprises."_ _Viko pointed towards Kensuke's house._ _"No more… impossible things."_  
"不。" Viko 耸了耸肩，让 Asuka 措手不及。他的眼中失去了那份标志性的年轻快乐。"我曾残忍。这是个残酷的世界。也许我们真的都已腐化，该死，但也许……我们也能变得更好。如果我们最终都混成一锅巨大的羊水汤，你或许能终结人类的残忍，是的。但……你也终结了人类的善良。不再有笑话。不再有礼物。" 他扔给她一瓶柠檬水，她轻松接住。"不再有惊喜。" Viko 指向 Kensuke 的家。"不再有……不可能的事。"

"_Impossible? Like that brat growing up and making sense?" she bit out. "Like me being able to actually sleep, and exist outside of piloting Unit 02? Sounds more plausible in this soup world of yours."_  
"不可能？像那小子长大后变得懂事？" 她咬牙切齿地说，"像我真能睡个好觉，不再只是驾驶二号机存在？在你那汤世界里听起来更靠谱。"

"_Then why do you keep following Shinji around? And don't give me that 'it's my duty' crap, Major. It's hope, isn't it?"_  
"那你为何一直跟着真嗣？别跟我说什么'这是我的职责'，少校。是希望，对吧？"

Asuka leaned back on the chair and stared at the ceiling. The tune ended, so she rewound and pressed play as though she had been using the tape player for decades. Beside her, Shinji snoozed with the roundel still held in his hand. She took out the blue one and stared at it. Mari had always told her the small things made the largest differences in the end. What had started out as a lazy effort in positive reinforcement had ended up shaping the fate of humanity.  
明日香靠在椅背上，凝视着天花板。曲子结束了，她便倒带重播，仿佛已使用这磁带播放器数十年。在她身旁，真嗣手里还握着圆章，打着盹。她取出那枚蓝色的，凝视着它。玛丽总是告诉她，微小的细节最终会带来巨大的差异。起初只是懒散的正面强化尝试，最终却塑造了人类的命运。

"I'm not saying 'you were right', if that's what you're expecting," Asuka said to nobody. "But yeah, maybe even I was bratty and foolish enough to hope. What do you think, idiot? Where do we go from here?"  
“我并不是说‘你是对的’，如果你期待的是这个，”明日香对着空气说道，“但没错，或许我也有过幼稚和愚蠢到抱有希望的时候。你觉得呢，笨蛋？我们接下来该去哪儿？”

Shinji offered no reaction other than slightly adjusting his weight so as to hold her hand tighter. It was remarkable how he could keep such a grip while unconscious. Uninvited and unrelenting, the image manifested again. He was bleeding out on the Entry Plug's seat, coughing up blood and smiling as his skin grew paler, yet his hand clutched the roundel like a lifeline.  
真嗣没有任何反应，只是稍微调整了姿势，以便更紧地握住她的手。令人惊讶的是，他在无意识状态下竟能保持如此紧握。那幅未请自来、毫不留情的画面再次浮现。他正坐在插入栓的座位上，血流不止，咳着血，微笑着，皮肤越发苍白，但他的手紧握着圆章，仿佛那是生命线。

"Great. Now on top of dreams, I'll have nightmares," Asuka whispered. She tried and failed to glare at Shinji's sleeping form. "Where do I go from here?" she wondered again. "Is this what being human means, Four-eyes? What am I even doing?"  
“太好了。现在除了梦境，我还要做噩梦。”明日香低声抱怨。她试图瞪向真嗣的睡颜，却未能成功。“我该何去何从？”她再次自问。“这就是所谓的人性吗，四眼仔？我到底在做什么？”

_What have I been doing so far, except to slog through my own pitiable existence? What do I have to show for after this war, after so many years? How come playing that stupid video game is annoying nowadays? Why do I feel this unbearable calmness in my chest whenever the Idiot Tree sprouts another stupid leaf?  
迄今为止，除了艰难地熬过自己可悲的生活，我还做了什么？这场战争结束后，这么多年过去了，我有什么可展示的？为什么现在玩那个愚蠢的电子游戏会让我感到烦躁？每当那棵笨树又长出一片愚蠢的叶子时，为什么我会感到胸中难以忍受的平静？_

The makeshift kitchen flashed through her mind. Shinji's avian friends stood guard around it on most days, as though awaiting his return and protecting his property. _Their_ property.  
她脑海中闪过那个临时厨房的画面。大多数日子里，真嗣的鸟类朋友们围着它站岗，仿佛在等待他的归来并保护他的财产。他们的财产。

"You'll be glad to know all of those freaky birds survived. Don't ask me how," she told him. "Your little pet project got a bit damaged, but nothing that can't be rebuilt. You can go back to playing pots and pans with your newly acquired sibling after those wounds heal. She donated most of the blood Suzuhara needed to keep you alive. More than a liter, so you're technically related, now. Not that you weren't before, with the whole Yui Ikari clone thing. Ugh. It's boring if you just lay there."  
"你会很高兴知道那些怪鸟都活下来了。别问我怎么做到的，"她告诉他。"你的小宠物项目有点损坏，但没什么不能重建的。等你伤口愈合了，就可以回去和你新来的妹妹玩锅碗瓢盆了。她为救你捐了大部分须佐原需要的血，超过一升，所以你们现在算是血亲了。虽然之前因为你是碇唯克隆体的事，你们已经算是有关系了。唉，你要是一直躺着不动就太无聊了。"

Shinji seemed content. Despite not being able to sleep in his preferred position, the small smile had never truly faded from his features. Every few hours he'd stir, and drag her closer to the bed. _Good thing I brought water and a blanket this time. I'd almost forgotten what being thirsty felt like._ Her eyes traveled to their joined hands. _What am I doing?_  
真嗣似乎很满足。尽管无法以他喜欢的姿势入睡，但那抹微笑从未真正从他脸上消失。每隔几个小时他就会动一下，把她拉得更靠近床边。幸好这次我带了水和毯子。我差点忘了口渴是什么感觉。她的目光落在他们紧握的手上。我在做什么？

"_It's hope, isn't it?"_ "是希望，对吧？"

"Lately I've had some time to think. You'd be surprised to hear I've even been talking to other villagers. Well." She chuckled. "Mostly to trees, and _some_ villagers. You and I aren't really that different. Neither of us likes crowds, or strangers, or people in general. I wanted to believe this entire mess was your fault once, long ago. But… you never had any actual agency in those events, did you? You were manipulated, like I was. Used as a tool by those truly responsible for these Impacts."  
"最近我有些时间思考。你可能会惊讶地发现，我甚至和村里的其他人聊过天。嗯。"她轻笑了一声。"主要是和树，还有些村民。你和我其实没那么不同。我们都不喜欢人群，不喜欢陌生人，也不喜欢人多。很久以前，我曾一度想相信这一切混乱都是你的错。但……你从未在这些事件中真正掌握主动，对吧？你和我一样，都被操纵了，被那些真正该为这些冲击负责的人利用了。"

_And yet, you turned their plan on its head._ _I want to know what happened, I want you to tell me how that conversation with your father went. I … want to_ _go_ _fish__ing__. Read a boring novel, sleep at midday,_ _make sure the stupid brat trees don't die off._ _And I want you to be there._ _An impossible thing, huh?_  
然而，你却颠覆了他们的计划。我想知道发生了什么，我想让你告诉我你和你父亲的对话是怎么进行的。我……想钓鱼，读一本无聊的小说，中午睡个觉，确保那些笨蛋树不会死掉。我还希望你在那里。不可能的事，对吧？

"Something boring," Asuka murmured. "It's your fault." She pouted, strangely glad Shinji could not see it. "I never used to thinkabout the future, you know. I never thought I had one." Gendo Ikari crossed her mind. Her pout morphed into a frown. "That's how they get us, Shinji. They convince us that there _is_ no future, only the eternal now, and all we can do is survive until the next day and do it all over again. Exist, fight, suffer, alone in this sea of strangers. How is that any way to live?"  
"真是无聊透顶，" 明日香低声抱怨，"都是你的错。" 她噘起嘴，奇怪地庆幸真嗣看不见这一幕。"你知道吗，我以前从不考虑未来。我从未觉得自己有未来。" 碇源堂的身影在她脑海中闪过。她的噘嘴变成了皱眉。"他们就是这样控制我们的，真嗣。他们让我们相信没有未来，只有永恒的当下，我们能做的就是熬到第二天，然后周而复始。生存，战斗，忍受，在这片陌生人的海洋中孤独地挣扎。这样活着有什么意义呢？

The grip on her hand tightened. What had Shinji done for so long if not suffer, struggle and exist? He had been all but invisible for years, according to the brief stories of his past. She thirsted for more details on his life, more idle talks as they sat side by side. She wanted to find more similarities, more differences. More of everything.  
他握住她的手更紧了。真嗣这些年除了受苦、挣扎和生存，还做了些什么呢？根据他过去那些简短的故事，他几乎已经隐形多年了。她渴望了解更多关于他生活的细节，渴望更多闲暇时的交谈，就像他们并肩而坐时那样。她想要发现更多的相似之处，更多的不同之处。更多的所有。

"It came as a shock; realizing I was interested in _living_," she admitted. "I'm interested in building a way to live, and I think I'll start here." Asuka lay her head on the mattress and closed her eyes. "With you."  
"意识到我对生活产生了兴趣，这让我震惊，" 她坦白道，"我对构建一种生活方式感兴趣，我想就从这里开始。" 明日香把头靠在床垫上，闭上了眼睛。"和你一起。

"I was better off alone."  
"我一个人更好。"

Grunting, Misato raised the ax and brought it down with vehemence, almost cutting the root in half. She panted, legs shaking with exertion, and wiped the sweat off her forehead with a soaked handkerchief. The sun was merciless; it had already burnt the exposed skin of her arms to a crisp. The hat made her scalp itch, and blisters exploded in her hands after every strike.  
米萨托哼了一声，举起斧头猛地砍下，几乎将树根劈成两半。她喘着粗气，双腿因用力而颤抖，用一块湿透的手帕擦去额头上的汗水。太阳无情地炙烤着，她裸露的手臂皮肤已被晒得通红。帽子让她的头皮发痒，每次挥斧后手上的水泡都会破裂。

"Clean the field of weeds and roots, he said. It'll be easy, he said," she rasped, emptying her water bottle in four long gulps. "I'm burning off my brain cells while Ritsuko sits in her comfortable chair, with a freaking sun-" she slashed the root again, and again. "Powered-" the root broke in two at last. "Fan! Yeah, take that!"  
"清理田里的杂草和树根，他说。这很容易，他说，""她沙哑地说着，一口气喝完了水壶里的水。""我在烧掉脑细胞，而律子却坐在她那舒适的椅子上，享受着该死的太阳——""她再次挥斧砍向树根，一次又一次。""驱动的——""树根终于断成了两截。""风扇！没错，就是这样！""

After a well deserved scream of victory to the heavens, she tore the dried, crooked roots from the ground with savagery akin to an Evangelion in Berserk mode. Some of the nearby prisoners gave her odd looks before the guards screamed their usual 'back to work'. She noticed yet another, larger one next to her foot, so Misato rolled her eyes and swung.  
在一阵向天宣泄胜利的怒吼之后，她以堪比暴走模式下《新世纪福音战士》的狂暴，将那些干枯扭曲的根茎从地里连根拔起。附近的囚犯们投来奇怪的目光，直到狱警们一如既往地吼着“回去干活”。她注意到脚边还有一个更大的，于是美里翻了个白眼，挥手一拔。

Three weeks in the village felt like three years in the WUNDER. Living a sailor's life in a losing battle against the gods had its perks. Time was mostly inconsequential so long as Ikari was not actively doing something. Random skirmishes and battles had mingled together during those fourteen years. Endless tales and stories shared over a bottle of whatever alcohol they procured had made the months fade away.  
在村子里待了三周，感觉就像在《WUNDER》上度过了三年。与神明抗争的败局中，过着水手的生活也有其独特的好处。只要碇不主动做什么，时间大多无关紧要。那十四年间，无数的小冲突和战斗交织在一起。无论他们弄到什么酒，一瓶接一瓶地分享着无尽的故事和传说，让岁月悄然流逝。

Every day, the sound of birds outside woke her right before sunrise. No sooner than light peeked inside her room, Ryoji was on his feet and making breakfast. His hurried footsteps reverberated on the wooden floor and straight into her brain. She tried many times to get out of bed earlier and iniciate conversations, but her son was always busy. There was always a tree to trim, fruit to gather, vegetables to water, creeks to build, or as of late, livestock to feed.  
每天清晨，鸟儿在外面的叫声总是在日出前将她唤醒。天光刚透进她的房间，亮司就已经起身准备早餐了。他急促的脚步声在木地板上回响，直击她的脑海。她多次试图早起并开始交谈，但她的儿子总是忙个不停。总有树要修剪，水果要采摘，蔬菜要浇水，小溪要建造，最近还有家畜要喂养。

"At least up there I could just pretend he didn't hate me," she grunted to the soil. More blisters burst into a bloodied mess as the ax came down. "Can't blame him. I was never here, and the man who raised him gave his life to bring me back alive. All for what? I can't even say good morning. I don't know what he eats, or when. I don't know what he likes, or what he dislikes. We're as good as complete strangers."

_Pathetic. Right, Kaji? I can't find the right moment to tell our son we love him. Tell him about you, about his stupid, heroic father. I can't even hold him. What do I do?_ The root was too sturdy; it refuse to split under her onslaught. _What do I do, Viko? Is that even your name? Couldn't you leave me something? A manual, some instructions, a flashcard with bullet points. Something. Anything, anything at all._  
可悲。对吧，加持？我找不到合适的机会告诉我们的儿子我们爱他。告诉他关于你的事，关于他那愚蠢而英勇的父亲。我甚至无法拥抱他。我该怎么办？那根太坚固了；它在她猛烈的攻击下拒绝分裂。我该怎么办，Viko？那真的是你的名字吗？你就不能给我留下点什么吗？一本手册，一些指示，一张带要点的小卡片。什么都行，任何东西都好。

"Hey!" Ryoji's voice rang out. "Stop that, that's a healthy root from the pear tree! Hey! _Katsuragi_!"  
“嘿！” 谅的声音响起。“别那样，那是梨树上健康的根！嘿！葛城！”

Misato flinched mid-strike, almost dropping the ax on her feet. She was about to reprimand Ryoji for being so familiar when he rushed past her and knelt beside the root. "Oh, I was trying to clear the field. You said to clear the field."  
美里在挥斧的瞬间一缩，差点把斧头掉在脚上。她正要责备谅太随便时，他却从她身边冲过，跪在根旁。“哦，我正想清理场地。你说过要清理场地的。”

"I also asked you to be careful and make sure you dig out _dead_ roots, not live ones," Ryoji snapped back. He poured a generous helping of salve in the cuts and smeared it all over the wood. "This isn't the rain forest. Roots need to be underground, not sticking out like a vein."  
"我也告诉过你要小心，确保挖掉的是死根，不是活根，" 谅司厉声回道。他在伤口上倒了一大把药膏，涂抹在木头上。"这里不是雨林。根需要埋在地下，而不是像静脉一样突出来。"

_Weird, it's almost like he's rehearsing a line he read in a book._ Misato's hand traced the strange symbols engraved in the wooden handle. _Was it something he taught you, that guy? Is there anything left I can teach you, or something you can teach me? I love you, Ryoji. I do, with all my heart I lov-_  
奇怪，他简直像是在背诵书里读到的一句台词。美里手抚着木柄上雕刻的奇异符号。这是他教你的吗？还有什么是我能教你的，或者你能教我的吗？我爱你，谅司。我真的爱你，全心全意地爱——

"What are you doing?" her son hissed, eyes widening once he glanced at the ax. "You're getting the handle all bloody! Ah, man, it's gonna stain! Give it here." He almost ripped the tool from her gnarled fingers. "This was his favorite one, and you're just staining it like th- let me see your hands."  
"你在干什么？" 她的儿子低声说道，目光一瞥到斧头，眼睛就瞪大了。"你把柄都弄得血淋淋的！啊，天哪，会留下污渍的！给我。" 他几乎是从她扭曲的手指中夺过了工具。"这是他最喜欢的，你却把它弄得像——让我看看你的手。"

Feeling embarrassed, angry, and about to collapse from a heat stroke, Misato crossed her arms. "I'm fine. Sorry about staining your precious ax. Do you have a shovel or something else I can use? You said to clear the field."  
感到尴尬、愤怒，且快要中暑晕倒的 Misato 交叉双臂。“我没事。抱歉弄脏了你珍贵的斧头。你有铲子或其他我可以用的工具吗？你说过要清理田地的。”

"I know what I said," Ryoji replied. Rage flashed through his eyes for a moment, only to disappear just as quickly. He grabbed onto her shirt and tugged her towards a nearby creek. "You've made decent progress today. The rest can be cleared tomorrow. You can't expect to plant a field in a day. It takes small steps, little by little."  
“我知道我说过什么，”Ryoji 回答道。愤怒在他眼中闪过一瞬，随即又迅速消失。他抓住她的衬衫，拽着她朝附近的小溪走去。“你今天已经做得不错了。剩下的明天再清理。你不能指望一天之内就能种好田。这需要一步步来，一点一点地。”

Misato's jaw clenched in frustration. "If you say so," she gritted out. "You seem to know a lot about agriculture. And literature, and electronics. Do you speak a second language?"  
Misato 因挫败而咬紧牙关。“随你怎么说，”她咬牙切齿地说。“你似乎对农业很了解。还有文学，电子学。你会说第二语言吗？”

"Yeah, my brother was fluent in five. Least I can do is butcher two, right?" Ryoji offered her a strained smile, one that broke through her bad mood. "He always insisted I had to get a good education, and all the stuff about plants and trees is necessary if you want to survive."  
"是啊，我哥哥精通五种语言。我至少能糟蹋两种，对吧？" 凌司向她露出一个勉强的微笑，这笑容打破了她的坏心情。"他总是坚持我必须接受良好的教育，如果你想生存下去，了解植物和树木的知识是必要的。"

There were books aplenty in the house. From coloring to calligraphy, novels or entire botany encyclopedias, they decorated nigh every available surface. Paintings were also stuck to the walls, many her son had most likely drawn as a child. The tiny rocks in the yard were finely organized and colored, making everything about the house feel alive.  
家里到处都是书。从涂色本到书法，小说或整套植物百科全书，几乎每个可用的表面都装饰着它们。墙上还贴着画，许多可能是她儿子小时候画的。院子里的小石头被精心排列和着色，让整个房子都充满了生机。

Once they reached the creek, Misato unwound her arms and allowed Ryoji to inspect the blisters closer. "Guess I overdid it a little, huh," she said sheepishly. "It's nothing but tiny scratches."  
一到小溪边，美里就松开了手臂，让凌司更仔细地检查她的水泡。"我想我有点过头了，"她不好意思地说。"只是些小擦伤而已。"

"No field work for you tomorrow," Ryoji countered, pouring fresh water on her palms. Each wound was treated with care, she realized. There was no animosity in his demeanor. He looked sad and tired, but not furious. After the silence stretched between them and turned stifling, Misato saw him roll his eyes and sigh.  
"明天你不用去现场了，" 绫人反驳道，往她的手掌上倒上新鲜的水。她意识到，每一处伤口都得到了细心的处理。他的举止中没有敌意。他看起来悲伤而疲惫，但并不愤怒。沉默在他们之间蔓延，变得令人窒息，美里看到他翻了个白眼，叹了口气。

"Look, uh… mom," he started awkwardly. "I'm not like Shinji or Asuka, okay? I'm not emotionally stunted, nor do I hold a grudge against you for using me as a living weapon for more than a decade. The blonde lady with the short temper explained why you had to leave me here, so I don't hate you. Stop thinking I do. My brother raised me better than that; he insisted that I had to give you a chance."  
"听着，呃……妈妈，" 他尴尬地开口。"我和真嗣或明日香不一样，好吗？我不是情感上受阻，也没有因为你把我当作活体武器超过十年而怀恨在心。那个脾气暴躁的金发女士解释了你为什么不得不把我留在这里，所以我并不恨你。别再以为我恨你了。我哥哥把我教得更好；他坚持要我给你一个机会。"

_Why can't you be angrier? How are you so similar to your father without having ever met him?_ Forcing back tears, Misato nodded. "Your brother sounds like a good man."  
为什么你不能更生气呢？你从未见过你父亲，怎么能如此相似？强忍着泪水，美里点了点头。"你哥哥听起来是个好人。"

"Yeah," he nodded, smiling. "He was."  
“嗯，”他点头微笑，“他是。”

_Your father was also a good man. One day, I'll tell you all about him.  
你父亲也是个好人。有一天，我会把他的故事都告诉你。_

"How did you grow up to be so amazing?" she wondered out loud.  
“你是怎么成长得如此了不起的？”她不禁大声问道。

"I don't know, I don't think I'm amazing or anything," Ryoji mumbled. His cheeks brightened. "Everyone in the village raised me. I've always loved them and they've always loved me back. That's… about it, I suppose."  
"我不知道，我不觉得自己有什么了不起的，" 莲二嘟囔着。他的脸颊微微泛红。"村里的每个人都把我养大。我一直爱着他们，他们也一直爱着我。我想……大概就是这样吧。"

"Can you tell me more?" Misato cautiously asked. Her hands were now covered in small bandages and medical tape. "About your brother, I mean. I'd like to know a little more about the person who saved my life."  
"你能多告诉我一些吗？" 美里小心翼翼地问。她的手上现在满是小小的绷带和医用胶带。"我是说关于你哥哥的事。我想多了解一些救了我命的人。"

"Heh. That's so lame; he always found something extravagant to do, mostly to make me laugh." Ryoji motioned towards a large fallen log. They sat down next to each other for the first time since Misato's escape pod had landed in the village. "Well, for starters, he didn't like cursing for some reason. Ritsuko would have given him a headache."  
"呵呵。那真是太逊了；他总是找些夸张的事情来做，大多是为了逗我笑。" 莲二指向一根倒下的大树干。他们自美里的逃生舱降落在村子里以来，第一次并肩坐下。"嗯，首先，他不知为何不喜欢说脏话。如果是律子的话，肯定会让他头疼的。"

"Would you believe me if I told you she didn't use to be like that?" Misato asked, giggling. Some of the years faded away. She felt young. "Nicotine withdrawal must be horrible. Anyway, back to your brother. What would he do if he heard you curse?"  
"如果我告诉你她以前不是这样的，你会相信吗？" 美里笑着问道。一些岁月似乎消逝了，她感觉自己年轻了许多。"戒烟一定很痛苦。不过，还是回到你哥哥的话题上吧。如果他听到你骂人，会怎么做？"

"Look severely disappointed, mostly. Extra plant duty, cleaning the forge, helping the elders, you name it," Ryoji explained. His laughter was like music, calming and joyful. "Sometimes he'd take me on these long hikes. Days of walking through the rubble, whole weekends out in the forest caring for the trees. Finally I'd admit that I was wrong, and he'd say 'Oh, wrong about what?' So I'd have to go over what I did, and then he'd smile and say 'I had forgotten all about it! Here, have some lemonade'. And on that note," Ryoji handed her a bottle. "Have some lemonade. It's good for you."  
"多半会显得非常失望吧。额外的植物养护工作，打扫锻造厂，帮助长辈们，诸如此类的事情，" 凌二解释道。他的笑声如同音乐，既平静又愉悦。"有时候他会带我去远足。在废墟中行走数日，整个周末都在森林里照顾树木。最后我会承认自己错了，他会问'哦，错在哪里？' 于是我得重述我所做的事，然后他会微笑着说'我都忘了这事了！来，喝点柠檬水'。说到这里，" 凌二递给她一瓶柠檬水。"喝点柠檬水吧，对你有好处。"

"Do you know the truest sign of having brought some goodness into this world?" Misato asked offhandedly. Ryoji shook his head, slightly perplexed. She smiled, and placed a hand on his shoulder. He did not shy away. "When everyone smiles as they remember you."  
"你知道在这个世界上留下善意的最真实标志是什么吗？" 美里不经意地问道。凌二微微摇头，有些困惑。她微笑着，把手放在他的肩膀上。他没有避开。"当人们回忆起你时，都会面带微笑。"

Rei frowned. 丽皱起了眉头。

The harvest was to begin in two days. Regardless of how friendly or kind the farmers were, she felt it. It was in the women's gazes whenever they looked at her. Sadness, melancholy, regret, and longing. They cherished a person who had worn her face, but not her soul. Many asked which name she was most comfortable with, and it was getting exhausting to repeat _she_ was Rei Ayanami, and not one of her siblings.  
收获将在两天后开始。无论农夫们多么友好和善良，她都能感受到。每当她们看着她时，眼神中流露出的悲伤、忧郁、遗憾和渴望。她们珍视一个曾拥有她面容却非她灵魂的人。许多人问她最习惯用哪个名字，重复自己是绫波丽而非她的兄弟姐妹之一，这让她感到疲惫。

Before her, a finely crafted tomb overlooked both the rice fields and mountains, with a breathtaking view of practically the whole village and its all-encompassing greenery. Construction could be heard from afar; the efforts to house every 'returnee' were constant and efficient. Shinji was healing quickly, as well. He was able to walk with crutches, which the Second Child prevented at every given chance. She had procured a wheelchair, which allowed Shinji to greet the villagers and sailors.  
在她面前，一座精心打造的坟墓俯瞰着稻田和群山，几乎能一览整个村庄及其郁郁葱葱的全貌。远处传来建筑的声音；为每位“归乡者”提供住所的努力持续而高效。真嗣也在迅速康复中，他已经能借助拐杖行走，但二号少女每次都阻止他这样做。她弄来了一辆轮椅，这让真嗣得以与村民和船员们见面。

Still, discomfort nestled in her stomach and grew each time she saw them interact. The competition had begun many years before, and had resumed without her being able to partake at all. Perhaps she was completely human now, down to the marrow of her bones. Perhaps the 'inefficient emotions' were true and honest instead of something Gendo Ikari had injected into her being. Defeat had come without her being able to fight back.  
尽管如此，每当她看到他们互动时，不适感便在她胃里滋生并愈发强烈。这场竞争多年前便已开始，而她却始终无法参与其中。或许她现在已彻底变成了人类，深入骨髓。或许那些‘低效的情感’是真实且诚挚的，而非碇源堂强加于她的。她未曾反抗，便已败下阵来。

'_Rei'_ '绫波'

"It is strange to see one's name on a grave," she told the woodpecker that sat on a nearby tree. "I am alive, and yet everyone relates me to someone who is not. How can I fill the role of someone who is not I, but looked exactly like I do?"  
“看到自己的名字刻在墓碑上，真是奇怪，”她对栖息在附近树上的啄木鸟说道，“我还活着，但每个人都把我与一个已逝之人联系在一起。我该如何扮演一个并非我本人，却与我长得一模一样的人呢？”

"Nobody expects you to be anything other than yourself."  
"没有人期望你成为别的样子，除了你自己。"

Hikari's voice rang out from behind, making Rei turn back in surprise. "Miss Horaki, good morning," she said with a bow. "It was not my intention to disrupt this place."  
光的声音从背后传来，让丽惊讶地转过身。“宝生小姐，早上好，”她鞠了一躬说，“我无意打扰这个地方。”

"Disrupt? You sound just like Shinji, sometimes." Hikari placed a beautiful bouquet of flowers next to the tomb, knelt and patted the spot behind her. "Care to join me in a little morning prayer, Rei? On nice days like this one, it's always good to show gratitude."  
“打扰？你有时候说话真像真嗣。”光将一束美丽的鲜花放在墓旁，跪下并拍了拍身后的位置。“愿意和我一起做个清晨的祈祷吗，丽？像今天这样美好的日子，表达感激总是好的。”

_Prayer._ Rei did as instructed and mimicked Hikari's hand motion. After her eyes closed, she was at a loss of how to proceed. _A solemn request for help or expression of thanks addressed to God or an object of worship._ Her mind went back to the dictionary Shinji had gifted her. _An earnest hope or wish._ _What do I wish for? My wish is to be closer to him. A sibling's bond is acceptable if I can stay at his side and protect him._ _Then, my wish has been granted. Am I to be grateful to the seeds of Life for this opportunity? If so, thank you._  
祈祷。丽按照指示模仿了光的动作。闭上眼睛后，她不知该如何继续。向神或崇拜对象发出的庄严求助或表达感谢。她的思绪回到了真嗣送给她的那本词典。真诚的希望或愿望。我想要什么？我的愿望是更接近他。如果能留在他身边并保护他，兄妹之情也是可以接受的。那么，我的愿望已经实现了。我是否应该感谢生命之种给予的这次机会？如果是这样，谢谢你。

After Hikari gently clasped her hands, she motioned for Rei to follow her. They reached the small clearing of the Horaki household.  
光温柔地合掌后，示意丽跟随她。她们来到了葛城家的那片小空地。

"Your sister was very dear to us all, that's why many of the villagers seem sad when they see you. It'll take a bit of time, grieving is a long process, but..." Hikari paused, then giggled. "Even Tsubame knows you're two completely different people, so don't worry. All of us would like for you to be you, and to maybe find a happy place here, with us." Rei's former classmate, now a mature and wise woman, patted her shoulder with affection. "And if you ever feel like you want to expand your horizons, now you can. Travel, have an adventure. Like Shinji says, find your treasure."  
"你姐姐对我们大家都很重要，这就是为什么许多村民看到你时会显得悲伤。哀悼是一个漫长的过程，需要一些时间，但……"光里顿了顿，然后轻声笑了起来。"即使燕也知道你们是完全不同的两个人，所以别担心。我们都希望你能做你自己，也许能在这里找到一个快乐的地方，和我们在一起。"丽的前同学，现在是一个成熟而睿智的女人，亲切地拍了拍她的肩膀。"如果你有一天觉得想拓展视野，现在你可以了。去旅行，去冒险。就像真嗣说的，找到你的宝藏。"

"My sister." Rei mulled over the words. A sister she had never known, a world she knew very little of. "An adventure would be acceptable in some time," she decided, nodding. "For now, I would like to watch over Shinji, and be useful to the village in whichever way I can be."  
"我的姐姐。"丽反复思考着这个词。一个她从未了解过的姐姐，一个她知之甚少的世界。"一段时间后，冒险是可以接受的，"她决定，点头道。"现在，我想照顾真嗣，并以任何我能做到的方式对村庄有用。"

"You also want to learn to cook, hmm?" Hikari added with a sly smile. "I can teach you a few recipes that will make Asuka boil with jealousy. How's that for an adventure in the short term?"  
"你还想学做饭，嗯？"光里带着狡黠的微笑补充道。"我可以教你几个会让明日香嫉妒得发狂的食谱。这对你来说算不算短期内的冒险呢？"

_I doubt the taste or quality of a meal will make any difference in Shinji's mind, but the Second's reaction certainly would be entertaining._ Rei smiled as well, nodding. "This also sounds acceptable."  
我怀疑一顿饭的味道或质量在真嗣心中能有多大影响，但二号机的反应肯定会很有趣。绫波也笑了，点头道：“这听起来也不错。”

"Great! We start with the lessons right after the rice harvest is done, how's that?" After Rei nodded, Hikari leaned in. "There's an old saying; the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. A little bird told me your eyes are glued to a certain young man whenever he comes by to help, or deliver firewood. Tall, snowy hair, ruby-colored irises. Hmm?"  
“太好了！我们就在稻米收割结束后开始上课，怎么样？”绫波点头后，光子凑近了些。“有句老话说，要抓住男人的心，先抓住他的胃。有只小鸟告诉我，每次某个年轻人来帮忙或送柴火时，你的眼睛就离不开他。高高的，雪白的头发，红宝石般的眼睛。嗯？”

Ruby was indeed the color that bristled on Rei's cheeks. Kaworu had warranted her attention from the first moment she had seen him. He was helpful, curious, charming and attractive, all words she had highlighted and studied in her new dictionary. The young man was also a former hybrid, grown in a lab through meticulous genetic research, and raised as a weapon to be deployed at the appropriate time.  
绫波的脸颊确实染上了红宝石般的色彩。从第一次见到他起，渚薰就引起了她的注意。他乐于助人，好奇心强，魅力四射且颇具吸引力，这些词她都在新买的字典里特别标注并仔细研究过。这位年轻人还是个前混合体，通过精密的基因研究在实验室中培育长大，被培养成在适当时机部署的武器。

"We have… insightful… conversations," she revealed in a whisper. Her face was scalding. "I would very much like to learn how to prepare the rice cakes he complimented yesterday."  
"我们有过……深入的……对话，"她低声透露，脸上热得发烫。"我非常想学会如何制作他昨天称赞的米糕。"

Hikari's grin widened. The woman's disposition was contagious, so much that Rei forgot all about the stares for a few precious hours. Despite having agreed upon starting her cooking lessons after the harvest, Hikari admitted there was some old rice they could use that very afternoon. Rei recalled the excitement of cooking for the Commander and Shinji, so many years before. A similar sensation ran through her body as she prepared treats for herself, Shinji, Kaworu, and even one for Shikinami.  
光的脸上的笑容更甚。她的情绪极具感染力，以至于丽在宝贵的几个小时内完全忘记了周围的目光。尽管她们约定在收获后才开始烹饪课程，光承认那天下午他们可以用一些旧米。丽回想起多年前为司令和真嗣做饭时的兴奋感。当她为自己、真嗣、薰，甚至为式波准备点心时，一种类似的感觉涌遍全身。

_Adventure. Noun, ad-ven-ture._ A smile blossomed on her features without realizing. _An unusual and exciting, typically hazardous, experience or activity. Something daring and intriguing that calls for enterprise and enthusiasm._  
冒险。名词，冒-险。她的脸上不自觉地绽放出笑容。一种不寻常且通常充满危险的体验或活动。需要勇气和热情的大胆而引人入胜的事物。

"No." "不行。"

The flat tone Asuka used almost made him flinch, and solidified his strenuous fate. She was not impressed by his pleading look or the pout, but barked half a chuckle when he pretended to be a petulant child and crossed his arms.  
明日香使用的平淡语气几乎让他退缩，这坚定了他艰难的命运。她对他的恳求眼神和噘嘴并不为所动，但当他假装成一个任性的孩子并交叉双臂时，她半笑了一声。

"It's just a little repairing," Shinji mumbled. "Don't see why I can't at least try to fix the grill, or remake the fireplace. I can walk just fine."  
“只是修修补补而已，”真嗣咕哝着。“我不明白为什么我至少不能尝试修理烤架，或者重建壁炉。我走路没问题。”

"No, you can hobble," Asuka countered with ease. "Fixing this means mixing up clay with water, which entails engaging your abdominal and leg muscles, which means you're not doing any of that today. Am I understood?"  
“不，你只能一瘸一拐，”明日香轻松地反驳道。“修理这个意味着要用水和泥，这需要用到你的腹部和腿部肌肉，这意味着你今天不能做这些。明白了吗？”

"Spoilsport," Shinji teased, and earned another tug at the hat for his trouble. "Thanks for bringing me here, though. I missed this place." His eyes were drawn to the penguin leader. It stood a few feet from them, and would occasionally glance at them and ruffle its feathers. "I'm really happy our crew is okay. We wouldn't have had half as good a fishing day without them."  
"扫兴鬼," 真嗣打趣道，结果又因此被拽了一下帽子。"不过还是谢谢你带我来这儿。我挺想念这个地方的。" 他的目光被企鹅首领吸引。它站在离他们几英尺远的地方，时不时地瞥他们一眼，抖抖羽毛。"我真的很高兴我们的团队平安无事。没有他们，我们今天捕鱼也不会这么顺利。"

"Pretty sure the fish are reproducing at alarming rates now, but whatever," Asuka said. She retrieved her line and threw it back in the water. "Suppose your avian friends had a tiny fraction of influence in our success today." The leader squeaked in her direction, annoyed. "Don't complain at me, you fuzzy little bird. Your beloved human already gave you and yours lots of plunder."  
"我敢肯定鱼现在繁殖得快得吓人，但管它呢，" 明日香说。她收起钓线，再次抛入水中。"估计你那些鸟朋友今天也起了点小作用。" 首领朝她发出一声不满的叫声。"别冲我抱怨，你这毛茸茸的小鸟。你那心爱的主人已经给了你和你的同伴不少好处了。"

"He likes you more than he does me," Shinji said. The leader seemed to nod. _Or maybe he's just itchy. Heh. "_He sits on your side every time we come here."  
"他更喜欢你而不是我，" 真嗣说。首领似乎点了点头。或许它只是痒了。呵呵。"每次我们来这儿，他都坐在你那边。"

"Yeah, because my pile is bigger. Just wants to snack on my success, that one," Asuka replied. "He better not make a habit out of making my pants dirty."  
“是啊，因为我的那堆更大。他就想蹭我的成功，这家伙，”明日香回答道，“他最好别养成弄脏我裤子的习惯。”

"It's almost like I didn't see you pet him yesterday," he offered with a sly smile. "You don't have to pretend when it's just you and me, you know."  
“简直就像我昨天没看到你抚摸他一样，”他带着狡黠的微笑说，“只有我们俩的时候，你不必假装，你知道的。”

Asuka's shoulders loosened. She shook her head, smirking. "Heh. Think I liked you better as a mute, idiot," she said with a teasing voice he was barely getting to know. "Who said I was pretending? I just assumed that if I scratched the bird's head, it'd eventually go away. Now I'm stuck with it, like a sea dog or something."  
明日香的肩膀放松了。她摇摇头，轻笑着说：“哼，我觉得我更喜欢你当个哑巴，傻瓜，”她用一种他刚刚开始熟悉的戏谑语气说道，“谁说我是在假装？我只是以为如果我挠了那只鸟的头，它最终会离开。现在我却被它缠上了，像个海狗什么的。”

"There are worse things than being a penguin's favorite human," Shinji mentioned. "Like being stuck in a chair. For weeks. Or having two rods impale you, that's unpleasant."  
"成为企鹅最喜欢的那个人的确不算最糟糕的事，" 真嗣说道。"总比被困在椅子上好，几周都动弹不得。或者被两根杆子刺穿，那才叫难受。"

"Not like you were conscious for most of it, idiot," Asuka retaliated swiftly. "You hit your head really hard. Maybe that's why you're more talkative now; the impact fixed whatever wasn't working so well before." She pretended to ponder on something, then gazed at him with the shadow of a grin. "Or maybe you're just heavily concussed, and the effects haven't worn off."  
"不像你大部分时间都是昏迷的，白痴，" 明日香迅速反驳道。"你撞到头了，可能就是因为这个你现在话多了；撞击修复了之前不太灵光的部分。" 她假装思考了一下，然后带着一丝笑意看着他。"或者你只是严重脑震荡，效果还没消退。"

"B-But I thought you told me you wanted me to talk!" Shinji jokingly stuttered, making Asuka giggle. His heart swelled. "Mute brat Shinji wasn't half as fun to be around as not-so-quiet idiot Shinji, wouldn't you agree? Granted, mute Shinji was allowed to cook, and play with clay."  
"可你不是说希望我多说话吗！" 真嗣开玩笑地结巴道，逗得明日香咯咯笑。他的心感到温暖。"沉默寡言的真嗣可没现在这个不那么安静的傻瓜真嗣有趣，你不觉得吗？当然，沉默的真嗣可以做饭，还可以玩黏土。"

"Pfft, idiot," she giggled again, a sound more entrancing than any song. "Give it another two months and you can go back to chopping wood and working yourself to unconsciousness. I bet you're itching to run along with the construction team. Isn't it nice to just rest and be driven around and pampered by the entire village? Hell, Koga and the others made that ramp and everything, and all you can think of is a time where you won't use it. Perhaps the idiot should heed his own advice and be grateful."  
"噗，傻瓜，"她又咯咯笑了起来，那声音比任何歌曲都要迷人。"再过两个月，你就可以回去砍柴，把自己累到不省人事了。我打赌你一定迫不及待想加入建筑队。难道不好好休息，被全村人照顾和宠着不好吗？见鬼，阿刚他们还做了那个斜坡，而你满脑子想的却是用不到它的日子。或许这个傻瓜应该听从自己的建议，学会感恩。"

Breathing in the sight of a colorful sunset and the smell of ocean breeze, Shinji leaned back and pointed to the roundel shining on his cap. "I am. I just wish I could be out there helping, like you or Ryoji or Rei. And I miss cooking."  
呼吸着绚烂夕阳的景象和海风的气息，真嗣向后靠去，指了指帽子上闪耀的徽章。"我会的。我只是希望能像你、亮司或绫那样出去帮忙。还有，我想念做饭。"

"So you're saying my food tastes bad?"  
"所以你是说我做的饭不好吃？"

"No! And it doesn't." "不！而且并没有。"

"Then, does Ayanami's food taste bad?"  
"那么，绫波做的食物不好吃吗？"

"What, no? Of course not!"  
"什么，不？当然不是！"

"Damn it." "该死。"

Shinji blinked. "Hmm? What was that?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼。 "嗯？那是什么？"

"What are you talking about? Anyway, time to pack up. It'll get dark soon." Asuka stored the fish and placed the container on his lap. "Be a good shopping cart and don't drop this."  
"你在说什么啊？不管怎样，该收拾东西了。天快黑了。" 明日香把鱼收好，把容器放在他腿上。 "乖乖当个购物车，别把这弄掉了。"

"Do you _want_ Rei's cooking to taste bad?" Shinji inquired with a raised eyebrow. His hat was tugged yet again. "Do I get extra idiot points if I say I like yours better?"  
"你想让丽做的饭变得难吃吗？" 真嗣挑着眉毛问道。他的帽子又被拉了一下。"如果我说更喜欢你的，会不会多得几分傻瓜分？"

"You just might," she said. "See ya, feathers."  
"你还真有可能，" 她说。"再见，羽毛们。"

"See you guys tomorrow." Shinji waved at the waddle of penguins, some of which waved back and squawked their farewells. "Kinda eerie that they learned to do that so quickly, don't you think?"  
"明天见，各位。" 真嗣向那群企鹅挥手，其中几只也挥手回礼，嘎嘎叫着告别。"它们这么快就学会这样做，你不觉得有点诡异吗？"

"I told you, they're creepy birds. Our creepy birds, but creepy all the same." Asuka put away her fishing gear and started pushing the wheelchair towards Kensuke's house. "How's the pain? You were turning red and blue trying to reel in that fish."  
"我告诉过你，那些是诡异的鸟。虽然是我们这里的，但还是很诡异。" 明日香收起钓鱼装备，开始推着轮椅朝健介家走去。"疼痛怎么样？你刚才为了拉那条鱼，脸都红一阵蓝一阵的。"

Shinji glanced at his midsection, prodding around the healing gash. "Just a little rusty, I guess. It doesn't hurt that much, anymore. The leg bothers me more than my side."  
真嗣瞥了一眼自己的腹部，轻轻按了按正在愈合的伤口。"大概只是有点生锈了吧。现在没那么疼了。腿上的伤反而更让我难受。"

"That's because the rod protruding from it was rusted and cracked. It's a miracle it didn't just gouge out your nerves, or slice an artery." Her voice turned stern, a shadow of the tone she had used before. "That'll teach you to land on debris despite having a perfectly good field right next to it."  
"那是因为插在里面的钓竿生锈又裂开了。真是奇迹，它居然没伤到你的神经，或者割破动脉。" 她的语气变得严厉，带着之前那种语气的影子。"这就是你不顾旁边明明有块好地，偏要落在碎片上的教训。"

"Were you worried about me?"  
"你担心我了吗？"

"Duh. What do you think, idiot?" Asuka's knuckles glided off his scalp. "Was that not made clear to you throughout the whole month I watched over you?"  
"废话。你以为呢，傻瓜？" 明日香的指节从他的头顶滑过。"难道我整个月照顾你这一点还不够明显吗？"

"Going on two months, actually," Shinji clarified. He looked up at her beautiful face and smiled sheepishly. "Thank you."  
"实际上快两个月了，" 真嗣纠正道。他抬头望着她美丽的脸庞，羞涩地笑了笑。"谢谢你。"

They fell into a comfortable silence. After paying their respects to Viko's grave and picking a few limes from the ground, they reached an empty house illuminated by a few candles. Asuka heated up leftovers from the day before in their newly acquired microwave while Shinji wheeled himself around the dining area and inspected some of Mari's books. Dinner was swift and tasty, with plenty of burnt rice for Shinji to snack on.  
他们陷入了一种舒适的沉默。在向 Viko 的墓地致敬并从地上捡了几颗青柠后，他们来到了一间被几支蜡烛照亮的空房子。明日香用他们新买的微波炉加热了前一天剩下的食物，而真嗣则坐着轮椅在餐厅周围转悠，检查着一些真希的书。晚餐迅速而美味，真嗣还有许多烧焦的米饭可以当零食吃。

Once the pair reached the bed, Asuka crouched so that he could wrap his arms around her. "One, two, three," she whispered, and they both stood in one fluid motion. "You can let go of me now."  
当两人到达床边时，明日香蹲下身，让他可以抱住她。“一，二，三，”她低声说道，他们一起流畅地站了起来。“你现在可以放开我了。”

"Don't want to," Shinji muttered into the fabric of her jacket. _Take the leap._ "I've never been hugged before, so it's kind of your fault for introducing me to the practice in the first place."  
“不想放开，”真嗣咕哝着，把脸埋在她的夹克布料里。勇敢一跃。“我以前从未被拥抱过，所以这都怪你，是你先让我接触到这种行为的。”

"So long as you don't start bleeding all over me, I suppose I can tolerate it," Asuka replied. Her arms gradually held him tighter, to the point that her nails were nearly piercing his shirt. "Do you want your music box back?"  
"只要你别在我身上流血，我想我可以忍受。" 明日香回答道。她的手臂逐渐将他抱得更紧，以至于她的指甲几乎要刺穿他的衬衫。"你想拿回你的音乐盒吗？"

"No, thank you." Shinji said just as quietly. "I don't need it anymore."  
"不了，谢谢。" 真嗣同样轻声说道。"我已经不需要它了。"

"Good to know. I've grown rather fond of it." Asuka helped him lie on his uninjured side, then changed into her sleeping clothes, collapsed next to him and offered a headphone. "When the stupid tape doesn't jam, that is. Crazy how Four-eyes had a few cassettes that fit this box of yours, huh."  
"知道了也好。我倒是挺喜欢它的。" 明日香帮他侧躺到未受伤的一侧，然后换上睡衣，躺在他旁边，递给他一只耳机。"当那愚蠢的磁带不卡带的时候，还是挺不错的。四眼仔居然有几盘磁带能放进你的音乐盒，真是奇怪，对吧。"

_It's yours._ Shinji nodded, stifling a yawn. The first chords began to play. "Remind me to thank her for the great music."  
这是你的。真嗣点点头，强忍住一个哈欠。第一个和弦开始响起。“提醒我感谢她提供了这么好的音乐。”

"I'm not your secretary," Asuka mumbled back. "But I'll make an exception for certain bratty idiots."  
“我又不是你的秘书，”明日香咕哝着回道。“但为了某些讨厌的傻瓜，我会破例一次。”

"You're too kind." Shinji outstretched his hand. "Sorry for being such a burden these past few weeks."  
“你真是太好了。”真嗣伸出手。“抱歉，过去这几周给你添了这么多麻烦。”

Asuka's pinky finger intertwined with his. Her eyes closed. "It's not like I'd let anyone else take care of you. No more hunger strikes, though. And no more apologies, things you enjoy doing are not burdens." She groaned. "You made me sound like that oddball again. Happy?"  
明日香的小指与他的交缠在一起。她闭上了眼睛。“我可不是会让别人来照顾你的那种人。不过，别再绝食了。还有，别再道歉了，你喜欢做的事不是负担。”她抱怨道。“你又让我听起来像个怪人。满意了？”

"Yeah," Shinji nodded, struggling to keep his eyelids open. "I am."  
“嗯，”真嗣点头，努力不让眼皮合上。“我很高兴。”

"Figures, you have that dumb little smile on your face," Her voice mingled with the gentle tunes. "Idiot."  
“不出所料，你脸上挂着那傻乎乎的微笑，”她的声音与柔和的旋律交织。“笨蛋。”

"You're smiling, too," he mumbled, and fell into a peaceful slumber. "So… pretty…"  
"你也在微笑，"他喃喃道，随即陷入宁静的梦乡。"如此……美丽……"

Shinji's breathing deepened. He dreamed of the house, of goats and cows near their garden and trees brimming with fruit. Rei was there, and so were Ryoji and Misato. He dreamed of shade under a tree, and of Asuka's hand caressing his hair.  
真嗣的呼吸变得深沉。他梦见了那座房子，梦见了花园旁的山羊和奶牛，梦见了果实累累的树木。丽在那里，良治和美里也在。他梦见了树荫下的凉爽，梦见了明日香的手轻抚他的头发。

"Fine, you get extra idiot points today. It's not entirely unpleasant when you're honest," Asuka conceded after a few minutes. "I'll be honest, as well." Her gaze softened with fondness. "I'm really glad I met you, Shinji."  
"好吧，今天你额外获得了傻瓜积分。诚实起来倒也不算太糟，"明日香几分钟后让步道。"我也会诚实一点。"她的目光因柔情而柔和。"我真的很高兴遇见你，真嗣。"

_Happy. Happy. Happy. Everyone's happy.  
快乐。快乐。快乐。每个人都很快乐。_

The pebble bounced off one of the wagons after he kicked it. The impact left a sizable dent in the surface, but he simply shrugged and pushed his fists deep into his jacket pockets. Barely anybody was awake so early in the morning, so there was no need to be extra cheerful or force a smile. In a way, he understood why Kensuke roused before dawn every day.  
他踢起的小石子弹到了一辆马车上，撞击在表面留下了一个不小的凹痕，但他只是耸了耸肩，将双手深深插进夹克口袋。清晨时分几乎没人醒来，所以没必要格外欢快或强装笑容。某种程度上，他理解为什么健介每天黎明前就起床。

"It's a bit like therapy, I suppose," Ryoji told the swallows flying above. "I can't be the rain on their parade, can I? I have a role to fulfill. A path to forge, a purpose to pursue, all the crap you told me for years." He frowned at the clouds. "Don't think I'll just forgive you for bailing on me. I know, I know, you had to keep your word, yada yada, but did you ever stop to think that maybe _you_ were more important to me? Huh? Did you?"  
"“我想这有点像治疗吧，”莲司对头顶飞过的燕子说，“我不能成为他们游行中的雨，对吧？我有我的角色要扮演。一条路要开辟，一个目标要追求，所有那些你多年来告诉我的废话。”他对着云朵皱眉，“别以为我会轻易原谅你抛弃我。我知道，我知道，你得守信，等等等等，但你有没有停下来想过，也许你对我更重要？嗯？你有没有？”

_Stupid freaking tears!_ _Stop it already!_ After furiously rubbing his eyes, Ryoji's stride doubled. His mother had been trying her best to connect with him as of late. Thrice already she had woken before him and prepared breakfast, and despite the toast being burnt to charcoal and the eggs being overcooked, the meals had somewhat warmed his chest.  
该死的泪水！快停下！愤愤地揉了揉眼睛后，莲司加快了步伐。最近，他的母亲一直在尽力与他沟通。她已经三次比他早起准备早餐，尽管吐司烤成了炭，鸡蛋也煮过了头，但这些早餐多少温暖了他的心房。

"Give her a chance, I know," he growled. His shoulders loosened a bit after entering the forest. "I'm doing the best I can. I thought caring for the crops would take more time, and I'd just be able to work through the grief. I don't like having time off. I don't like telling her about my life, because it makes me think of you, and I get sad."  
“给她一个机会，我知道，”他低吼道。进入森林后，他的肩膀稍微放松了一些。“我已经在尽力了。我以为照顾庄稼会花更多时间，我就能在悲伤中工作。我不喜欢闲着。我不喜欢向她讲述我的生活，因为这让我想起你，我会感到难过。”

Viko's grave was located in his favorite spot, as the man would have wanted. There was no body, but plenty of flowers and colorful plants all over the orthodox cross. His name was engraved on a slab of smooth granite, located strategically so both sunrise and sunset illuminated it at some point of the day. There was a crude assortment of wild plants next to a bundle of forget-me-nots on the base, which meant Asuka and Shinji had visited the night before.  
维科的墓地位于他最喜欢的地方，正如他所愿。虽然里面没有遗体，但墓碑上覆盖着许多鲜花和彩色植物。他的名字刻在一块光滑的花岗岩板上，位置经过精心挑选，以便在一天中的某些时刻，日出和日落都能照亮它。墓碑旁有一束野花和一束勿忘我，这意味着明日香和真嗣昨晚来过。

Ryoji placed a small sunflower at the center, then knelt and forced his hands together. "The pears and limes are ripe," he said. "Rice harvest began a few days ago. Plenty of good grain, and the extra hands really made a difference. We got some much-needed food supplies from… heh, well, you guess which country sent it." His eyes opened, and the joyful mask slipped from his face altogether. "I don't know how you managed all this. All the responsibilities, all the help to the villagers, and being legitimately optimistic about it all every single moment. It's hard. I'll get the hang of it, eventually. You raised me, after all. Still… it's hard."  
莲司将一朵小小的向日葵放在中央，随后跪下，双手合十。“梨和青柠都熟了，”他说道，“稻米收割几天前就开始了。粮食充足，多亏了那些帮手，真是帮了大忙。我们还从……嘿，你猜是哪个国家送来的急需食品。”他睁开眼，脸上的喜悦面具彻底滑落。“我不知道你是怎么做到这一切的。所有的责任，对村民的帮助，以及每时每刻都真正乐观地面对这一切。这很难。我最终会适应的。毕竟，是你把我养大的。尽管如此……这真的很难。”

He took out one of the many notebooks Viko had left him. There were seven of them, one for each year, each prepared by his brother with notes, advice, jokes, drawings, and unfiltered rants about botany. Ryoji felt a tiny bit of relief upon seeing Viko's handwriting.  
他拿出维科留给他的众多笔记本中的一本。总共有七本，每本代表一年，每本都由他的哥哥精心准备，里面有笔记、建议、笑话、图画，以及关于植物学的未经修饰的抱怨。看到维科的字迹，莲司感到一丝慰藉。

'_Don't be discouraged when you feel sad, or lost. It's perfectly normal. I'm so sorry I won't be there to help you glide through this challenge, but I have faith that everyone else in the village will be. Don't be too hard on your mom, please? Do it for me, will ya? Come on, for lil old lame Viko. Cry whenever you need to cry, let it out. If you feel like you need to scream at your mom, let her have it. Just no cursing, try to be precise in your speech. Remember, the strongest men carry the heaviest burden while wearing a smile, a genuine one. Struggle breeds meaning and character. Remember always; you are loved.'_  
“当你感到悲伤或迷失时，不要气馁。这是完全正常的。很抱歉我不能在那里帮助你度过这个难关，但我相信村里的其他人会帮助你的。请不要对你的妈妈太苛刻，好吗？为了我，好吗？来吧，为了小小的、跛脚的 Viko。想哭的时候就哭吧，释放出来。如果你觉得需要对妈妈大喊大叫，那就让她听到。只是不要骂人，尽量精确地表达你的想法。记住，最坚强的人在微笑时背负着最沉重的负担，一个真诚的微笑。挣扎孕育意义和品格。永远记住；你是被爱的。”

Sobs wracked his body soon after. The notebook's cover was stained with his tears, and still Ryoji tried to bite down on his lip and push the emotions back to the pit of his stomach. It felt like someone had taken a piece of his soul and killed it, never to be recovered. A wound so deep no salve or medicine could take away the pain.  
不久后，他全身都在抽泣。笔记本的封面被他的泪水浸湿，而 Ryoji 仍然试图咬紧嘴唇，将情绪压回心底。感觉就像有人夺走了他的一部分灵魂并将其杀死，再也无法找回。如此深的伤口，没有任何药膏或药物能消除疼痛。

Ryoji almost jumped in surprise when a hand clasped around his shoulder.  
当一只手搭在他的肩膀上时，Ryoji 几乎吓了一跳。

"I miss him, too," Shinji said. "Do you want to talk about it?"  
"我也想他，" 真嗣说。"你想谈谈吗？"

Shaking his head, Ryoji tried to get up and walk away, but Asuka's hand came down on his other shoulder like a vice. "Not happening. If you want to be a brat about this, then have your mother deal with you. It's what he'd want, anyway." She nodded towards the forest. "That's your cue. What, do I have to lift a neon sign? Get over here, Captain Katsuragi."  
摇头拒绝，凌二试图起身离开，但明日香的手像钳子一样按在他的另一个肩膀上。"没门。如果你想耍小孩子脾气，那就让你妈妈来处理你。反正这也是他希望的。"她朝森林点了点头。"该你出场了。怎么，难道我得举个霓虹灯牌吗？过来，葛城队长。"

_Huh? Why is she here?_ Ryoji's mood darkened further. Agony and heartache overshadowed every other emotion, however, and he was stuck there, unable to run home or hide away in the bushes. Without a chore or errand to run, there was no escaping the tidal wave of misery which reduced him to a slobbering mess.  
嗯？她怎么在这儿？凌二的心情更加阴沉。痛苦和心碎掩盖了所有其他情绪，然而，他被困在那里，无法跑回家或躲在灌木丛中。没有任务或差事可做，他无法逃避这股将他变成一团糟的痛苦浪潮。

Misato walked over. Concern was written on her face as she draped him in a strange blanket he'd never seen before. She spoke no words of comfort, and instead held him whilst sobs rocked his entire body. Shinji offered a final friendly pat before excusing himself and being wheeled away by Asuka. Ryoji's pride and stubbornness held for another good minute, then his body betrayed him. His arms desperately wrapped around Misato's body.  
美里走了过来。她脸上写满了关切，用一条他从未见过的奇怪毯子裹住他。她没有说任何安慰的话，只是抱着他，任由他的哭泣震撼着全身。真嗣最后友好地拍了拍他，然后借口离开，被明日香推走了。碇的骄傲和倔强又坚持了一会儿，但他的身体最终背叛了他。他的双臂急切地抱住了美里的身体。

"Shh, it's okay, baby. Let it all out. I'm here for you," she murmured. "Starting right now, I will _always_ be here for you. Come on, let's go home. I made all the arrangements, talked to Ritz, Koga and Shinji. You can take as many days off as you need."  
“嘘，没事的，宝贝。尽情发泄吧。我在这里陪着你，”她低声说道，“从现在开始，我会一直在这里。来吧，我们回家。我已经安排好了一切，和丽兹、Koga 还有真嗣谈过了。你需要多少天假都可以。”

Barely able to keep from hyperventilating, Ryoji allowed himself to be taken back to the house. His mother fed him soup that did not taste of instant curry for once. She cleaned his face and combed his hair with her fingers. He cried for half a day, stopping only to use the bathroom or drink water, and the afternoon and sunset he spent sprawled on his mother's lap, hearing stories about his father, alcoholic penguins, the world before Third Impact, and she being a careless, klutzy drunk in her youth.  
碇几乎无法控制自己的呼吸，任由自己被带回家。他的母亲给他端来了一碗汤，这次没有速食咖喱的味道。她帮他擦脸，用手指梳理他的头发。他哭了半天，只是为了上厕所或喝水才停下来，下午和日落时分，他躺在母亲的腿上，听着关于他父亲、酗酒的企鹅、第三次冲击前的世界，以及她年轻时如何粗心大意、笨手笨脚又酗酒的故事。

"So," he said at night, while they sat on the porch and listened to one of his old cassettes. "What's your stance on lemonade, Mom?"  
"那么，" 他在夜晚说道，当他们坐在门廊上，听着他的一盘旧磁带。"你对柠檬水有什么看法，妈妈？"

"I think it's really good for you," she replied. For once, she looked like a mother in his eyes. "Drinking a glass of lemonade every day is not only healthy, but also a refreshing… substitute for beer."  
"我认为它对你真的很好，" 她回答道。这一次，在她眼中，她看起来像一个真正的母亲。"每天喝一杯柠檬水不仅健康，而且是一种清爽的……啤酒的替代品。"

Ryoji's lips quirked upwards. "Figures," he said. "That's a lame answer, you know."  
莲二的嘴角微微上扬。"果然，" 他说。"你知道，这是个很逊的答案。

---

"Yeah, I'm aware. It's lame."  
“是啊，我知道。挺无聊的。”

Shinji stared at her quizzically, as though expecting the punchline of a joke he had not quite understood. He hobbled over to the tree she had pointed at. Even when it was clearly painful, he refused any assistance while sitting near the roots.  
真嗣困惑地盯着她，仿佛在期待一个他没完全理解的笑话的笑点。他一瘸一拐地走到她指的那棵树旁。即使明显感到疼痛，他还是拒绝任何帮助，坐在树根附近。

"It sounds like a fun time to me," he said. "Why wouldn't I want to go? It'll be the first actual festival in fifteen years, too. I bet everybody's gonna have a great time. Wait." His gaze narrowed at her, smiling deviously. "Do you not want to go, and are waiting for me to say that being around so many people would make me uncomfortable?"  
“听起来挺有意思的，”他说，“我为什么不想去呢？这可是十五年来第一个真正的节日。我敢打赌大家都会玩得很开心。等等。”他眯起眼睛看着她，狡黠地笑着，“你是不是不想去，等着我说在那么多人周围会让我感到不舒服？”

_Damn it!  该死！_

"That way you can say something like 'Ugh, fine. We don't have to go if it makes His Grace the brat so uneasy'." Shinji carried on, earning an annoyed grunt in response. "Because if that's the case, we don't have to go at all. I can finally stand long enough to cook, now! I'll just fix up a nice dinner and we can watch the fireworks from the yard."  
“这样你就可以说，‘呃，好吧。如果这让那位大人如此不安，我们不去也罢’。”真嗣继续说道，换来一声不悦的咕哝。“因为如果是那样的话，我们根本不用去。我现在终于能站久一点做饭了！我会准备一顿美味的晚餐，我们可以在院子里看烟花。”

_Clever fox. You're a quick learner, aren't you?_ Asuka grunted half a laugh and sat down. The book she had brought that day was boring enough to let her mind wander for at least two or three hours, so Shinji had prepared a few snacks and lemonade. _Picnic. Can't get more boring than this, Four-eyes. Bet you'd be proud._  
"狡猾的狐狸。你学得真快，不是吗？明日香半笑半哼地坐下。那天她带来的书无聊到足以让她神游至少两三个小时，所以真嗣准备了一些零食和柠檬水。野餐。没有比这更无聊的了，四眼仔。我打赌你会为此感到骄傲。”

"Fine. I don't want to go to the festival, not this year," she admitted at last. "People are just going to make a big fuss about 'the great heroes'. You should go if you want, though. Ayanami would be happy to be the idiot's plus one, I bet."  
“好吧。我今年不想去参加节日庆典，”她终于承认道，“人们只会大肆宣扬‘伟大的英雄们’。不过如果你想的话，你应该去。我敢打赌，绫波会很乐意当那个傻瓜的伴儿。”

_I'll just find a nice place to watch from a safe distance. Hell, I can even take the music box with me.  
“我找个安全距离的好地方远远地看就行了。见鬼，我甚至可以带上音乐盒。”_

"This will probably sound super lame, but," Shinji tentatively placed his hand on hers, "it won't be half as fun if you're not there. Maybe we can drop by for a few minutes, and then I can pretend my side hurts and we can go back. We get to see everybody for two seconds, _and_ we get a nice dinner, fireworks and we try out a new disc from Miss Mari's collection."  
“这听起来可能超级逊，但是，”真嗣试探性地把手放在她的手上，“如果你不在，那就一点儿也不好玩了。也许我们可以去一会儿，然后我可以假装我这边疼，我们就回去。我们能看到大家两秒钟，还能享用一顿美餐，看烟花，再试试玛丽小姐新收藏的唱片。”

"Bargaining, are we?" Asuka asked snidely. Her grip around his fingers tightened. "Thirty minutes, with a possible extension of an hour if there's good food. Then you fake an injury and we get the hell out before the masses go crazy."  
"讨价还价，是吗？" 明日香尖刻地问道。她握住他手指的力道加重了。"三十分钟，如果食物不错，可能会延长一小时。然后你假装受伤，我们在人群疯狂之前赶紧离开。"

"Deal." Shinji raised their joined hands. "Miso soup, sweet and sour chicken curry, omura rice and grilled sausages. I can try something with the pears as dessert."  
"成交。" 真嗣举起他们紧握的手。"味噌汤，甜酸鸡肉咖喱，大米饭和烤香肠。我可以试着用梨子做甜点。"

"Never was a big fan of pears, so good luck with that." Asuka tugged at his arm. Blinking, Shinji blushed and carefully placed his head on her lap. "Nice view you picked today. And not too far away, either. You can only walk so far with those stupid crutches, and yet you keep pushing the boundaries like an idiot."  
"我从来不太喜欢梨，所以祝你好运。" 明日香拉了拉他的手臂。眨眼间，真嗣脸红了，小心翼翼地将头靠在她的腿上。"你今天选的这地方视野不错。而且也不算太远。用那副愚蠢的拐杖你只能走这么远，可你还是像个傻瓜一样不断挑战极限。"

"But not like a brat?"  
"但不是像个小鬼那样吧？"

"Heh." Asuka's free hand briefly threaded through his hair, then picked up the book. Mari had left one of the flowers near the ending of the novel. "'Jayne Eyre'. Sounds boring."  
"呵呵。" 明日香空着的手短暂地梳理了一下他的头发，然后拿起书。真希波在小说结尾附近留下了一朵花。"《简·爱》。听起来很无聊。"

"Incredibly boring," Shinji added. "Do you want me to read today?"  
"极其无聊，" 真嗣补充道。"你想让我今天读吗？"

"Nah, you did enough today cooking for those ungrateful bastar- for the 'rehabilitation crew'. Plus, you handled the last book. It's my turn." She smiled, knowing it would delight him. "Sit back, relax, and enjoy your treasure for once, will you?"  
"不，你今天已经做得够多了，为那些不知感恩的家伙——为那些'康复团队'做饭。而且，你刚处理完最后一本书。轮到我了。" 她微笑着，知道这会让他高兴。"坐下，放松，享受你的宝贝吧，好吗？"

"Aye aye, Captain Shikinami."  
"遵命，式波船长。"

_Heh. That's the name the villagers picked for that cooking station they're building for you._ The roundel gleamed under the sunlight, secured around the collar of Shinji's shirt. Clear skies stretched across as far as the eye could see. There was no timer reaching zero anymore. _Asuka's enough, huh._  
呵呵。那是村民们为你建的那个烹饪站起的名字。圆徽在阳光下闪闪发光，固定在真嗣的衬衫领口。晴空万里，一望无际。再也没有倒计时归零的时刻了。有明日香在就够了，是吧。

She opened the book, smirking at the first sentence. It was bound to be a boring one indeed. She took out the SDAT and handed Shinji a headphone.  
她翻开书，对着第一句话轻蔑一笑。果然不出所料，这开头定是无聊至极。她拿出 SDAT，递给真嗣一只耳机。

"'There was no possibility to take a walk that day.' Hear that, idiot? No possibility, and yet you defied the odds."  
“'那天根本不可能去散步。'听到了吗，傻瓜？毫无可能，而你却逆天改命。

"Impossible things, little steps, lemonade, Asuka. You look pretty today."  
“不可能的事，小小的步伐，柠檬水，明日香。你今天看起来真美。

"Uh huh. Anyway, 'We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner, the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so somber, and rain so penetrating-' Hmm. We could use some rain. Brat trees are growing fast lately."  
"嗯哼。话说回来，‘我们确实在早晨在无叶的灌木丛中徘徊了一个小时；但自从晚餐后，寒冷的冬风带来了如此阴沉的云层，和如此刺骨的雨水——’嗯。我们确实需要些雨水。小鬼树最近长得很快。"

"The Idiot tree, too," Shinji said. "Maybe in a couple of years we can do this, but under its shade."  
"那棵傻树也是，" 真嗣说。"也许再过几年，我们就可以在它的树荫下做这件事了。"

"And get hit in the head by a peach? Idiot."  
"然后在头上被桃子砸中？傻瓜。"

"But not a brat, I hope. Maybe… a brat that redeemed himself into an idiot?"  
"但愿不是个捣蛋鬼。或许……是个改过自新成傻瓜的捣蛋鬼？"

Asuka laughed, eyes sparking with serenity. "Maybe."  
明日香笑了，眼中闪烁着宁静的光芒。 "或许吧。"

**FINIS. 完。**

_AN: Stop. Rewind. Play. You know the song. Play it!  
作者注：停下。倒带。播放。你懂这首歌。放起来！_

_First of all, thank you to my dearest wife for being amazing, and allowing me to enjoy wonderful vacation time at home in which I could write a few hours every day. Love you, baby. My eternal gratitude to my brothers **MisterHalt**, **Pilot_Fair**, **Su_Exodus**, **Bwanagator**, **Richitzer**, **WingZeroAlchemist**, **BornToWalken**, and **xhanthee** for helping me revise and improve the chapters in this fic!

_Alright! And so ends the one fic I actually put some elbow grease in. Figuratively. Factually? Who knows. I know, you know. Anyhow, I hope this lil story of mine wasn't so bad! Hopefully it was some form of improvement to what we got in the Rebuilds. I also tried to like not overstay my welcome or however actual writers do.  
好了！这篇我确实下了些功夫的同人文就此结束。打个比方。实际上呢？谁知道。我知道，你也知道。总之，希望我这个小故事不算太糟！希望它能为《新剧场版》带来一些改进。我也尽量不让自己显得多余，或者像真正的作家那样。_

_This came out as a little pet project that Mister Teeth revived, and ended up being something very dear to my heart. My way of coping with the canon material, I suppose. Of course, a very fluffy epilogue will make an appearance once I get a little more time off, that will cover among other things:  
这是由 Mister Teeth 重新启动的一个小宠物项目，最终成为了我心中非常珍贵的东西。我想，这是我应对正统材料的一种方式。当然，一旦我有更多空闲时间，就会有一个非常甜蜜的尾声出现，其中会涵盖以下内容：_

_More Ritsuko, because fuck yeah.  
更多律子，因为太棒了。_

_Are Asuka and Shinji aging normally, or at an accelerated pace until they reach the age of 28? Which means that yes, in this chapter they are fifteen.  
明日香和真嗣是正常衰老，还是加速成长直到他们达到 28 岁？这意味着是的，在这个《一千零一夜》中，他们十五岁。_

_Rei-Kaworu interaction that is actually not boring as fuck.  
真-渚薰互动，实际上并不他妈的无聊。_

_What happened to Mari? And Viko, where the fuck is he at?  
真希怎么了？还有维克，他他妈的在哪儿？_

_Misato-Ryoji bonding, and mother-son stuff.  
美里-绫人之间的情感联系，以及母子间的温情。_

_More Asushin, because fuck yeah.  
再来点 Asushin，因为太棒了。_

_With this, I say my farewells for the time being. Work calls! I'm truly grateful to each and every one of you that took the time to read this. Thank you!_ DB-chan bows. _I hope this was a worthy finale to my baby! If I could bother you with a review on your way out, that'd be awesome!_  
至此，我暂时告别。工作在召唤！我真心感谢每一位花时间阅读此文的朋友。谢谢你们！DB-chan 鞠躬。希望这对我的宝贝来说是个圆满的结局！如果你们离开前能留下评论，那就太好了！

_Remember always to stay healthy, do your cardio, eat your veggies, hug your parents, take adventures and find joy in this life! Much love, everyone!
