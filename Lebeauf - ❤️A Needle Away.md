A needle too far, a needle too close. The distance hedgehogs have to find. NGE, post magma diver. Fully revised.  
针尖过远，针尖过近。刺猬们需寻觅的距离。NGE 世界线，岩浆潜水员之后。全面修订版。

### Chapter 1 Prologue

"Alright. Oh, no problem. Haven't dropped it off yet, luckily."  
"好的。哦，没问题。幸好还没送过去。"

Ryoji Kaji wiped off the wound on the back of his hand and adjusted the shoulder holding his phone to his ear. It wasn't bleeding anymore, so he squeezed the slightly blood-soaked gauze to the sink and turned on the faucet. Rivulets of red, clearly visible even in the dark, were washed away in a second.  
加持良治擦去手背上的伤口，调整了一下夹着手机的肩膀。血已经不流了，他把稍微沾血的纱布挤向水槽，打开水龙头。即使在昏暗中也能清晰看见的红色细流，瞬间被冲走。

"I guess. Yeah. Ah, it's fine. The cargo was cooperative. Thanks for asking."  
"我想也是。嗯。啊，没事。货物很配合。谢谢关心。"

Cooperative was one way of putting it. Kaji eyed the wound on the back of his hand ruefully. Said cargo had put up quite a fight, but in the end, Kaji was able to overpower him handily. He grabbed some tissues and began to wipe the sink. Not like he could actually hide the traces of his presence from a dedicated investigator like this. It was more of a silly habit he had. A byproduct of his particular occupation. He had to shrug again to adjust the phone, because his motion almost made it slip off.  
合作，算是委婉的说法吧。卡吉瞥了一眼手背上的伤口，无奈地笑了笑。那货物可是拼死抵抗了一番，但最终，卡吉还是轻松制服了他。他抓起几张纸巾开始擦拭洗手池。这种小把戏哪能瞒得过像他这样专业的调查员。这不过是他职业习惯的一部分，一种愚蠢的习惯罢了。他不得不再次耸肩调整手机，因为刚才的动作差点让它滑落。

"It's nothing serious, right?" The voice on the phone sounded half-angry, half-dumbfounded. "I mean, not _serious_ serious. Yeah. Figured."  
“没什么大碍吧？”电话那头的声音半是恼怒，半是困惑。“我是说，不是那种严重的大事。嗯，明白了。”

Kaji put the used tissue in the toilet and flushed. By the time everything disappeared, the voice had also stopped. He nodded to the mirror, though there was no one to see the gesture.  
卡吉将用过的纸巾扔进马桶，按下冲水键。待一切消失后，电话那头的声音也停了。他对着镜子点了点头，尽管无人看见这一动作。

"That's good to hear. Yeah. Later, then. Kaji out."  
"听到这个消息真好。嗯。那回头见。加持，挂了。"

He slipped his phone into the pocket and clicked his tongue. It would be a lie if he didn't feel slightly annoyed to know that he went to this trouble for nothing. He didn't place much significance on the reason why. There wouldn't be any lasting effects in the long run, or so he thought.  
他将手机塞进口袋，咂了咂舌。如果说不感到一丝恼火，那肯定是骗人的，毕竟他白费了这么多功夫。他并不太在意原因。他认为长远来看，这不会有什么持久的影响。

He opened the folding door. The afternoon sun was heating up the place, the air turning stale and stuffy behind windows closed and locked by the departed residents. From the spotless sink that was a testament to the character of its manager came a harsh yet sweet scent of detergent, amplified by the hot air. And other smells came with it too, smells that even that of the detergent couldn't completely overpower. The smells of the inhabitants of this house, fused into the dark corners of the walls and the ceiling and the sliding door papers. The smell of life going on.  
他推开折叠门。午后的阳光让这个地方变得闷热，空气在离去的居民紧闭的窗户后变得陈旧而闷热。从干净得足以证明管理者性格的水槽中，飘来一股刺鼻却甜美的洗涤剂气味，在热空气的放大下更加浓烈。还有其他气味也随之而来，那些连洗涤剂也无法完全掩盖的气味。这栋房子居民的气味，融合在墙壁和天花板的暗角以及滑动门纸上。生活的气息，依旧在继续。

There was nothing special about it, but somehow it engulfed Kaji in feelings he could not explain. A mish-mash lump of conflicting emotions that felt like longing and disgust, that simultaneously attracted and repulsed him. He stood still at the threshold between the bathroom and the kitchen pondering this for a while, then shook his head and moved his feet again. He suddenly wanted to smoke, but he'd have to wait for that. He didn't want to leave his mark in this place. Or contribute his own scent to the mix. Half crossing the kitchen to the icebox between the table and the refrigerator, he knelt and undid the plastic lock. Before he could proceed the whole box shook from side to side and the lid exploded off. The would-be kidnap victim jumped up from inside, raised his head, and was mortified after finding his would-be abductor. Kaji flashed his easygoing smirk to the distrustful beady eyes.  
这并没有什么特别的，但不知为何，它让加持陷入了无法解释的情感之中。一种混杂着矛盾情绪的纠结，既有渴望又有厌恶，既吸引他又让他反感。他站在浴室和厨房之间的门槛上，沉思了一会儿，然后摇摇头，再次移动脚步。他突然想抽烟，但他得等一等。他不想在这个地方留下自己的痕迹。或者将自己的气味混入其中。他半跨进厨房，走向桌子与冰箱之间的冰盒，跪下并解开了塑料锁。在他继续之前，整个盒子左右摇晃，盖子突然炸开。本应是被绑架的受害者从里面跳了出来，抬起头，发现他的潜在绑架者后惊慌失措。加持对着那双不信任的小眼睛露出了他一贯的轻松微笑。

"I'm afraid the onsen trip is canceled, little friend."  
“恐怕温泉之旅要取消了，小家伙。”

"Wark!" “哇克！”

The creature's beady black eyes were so animated and full of emotions, more than Kaji often saw in many people's eyes in his business. He couldn't resist a bitter smile at that thought. What an interesting choice of pet Katsuragi made. "I was told one of your roommates was seriously injured during today's operation."  
那生物的小黑眼珠异常生动，充满了情感，比加治在生意场上见过的许多人的眼神都要丰富。想到这里，他不禁苦笑了一下。葛城选择这样的宠物真是别出心裁。“听说你们中的一位室友在今天的行动中受了重伤。”

The penguin tilted his head. Whether he understood what was spoken to him or not, the spy wasn't sure. For a moment, Kaji thought about patting his head as people often did to dogs and cats, but recalled what happened earlier and stopped. Instead he shook his head and stood up.  
企鹅歪了歪头。间谍不确定它是否理解了刚才的话。有那么一刻，加治想像人们常对猫狗做的那样拍拍它的头，但想起了之前发生的事，便停住了。他摇了摇头，站起身来。

"Bye, then. Have a good day. Say hello to Katsuragi, if you will."  
“那么，再见。祝你今天愉快。如果可以的话，向葛城问好。”

### Chapter 2 A long girl

Captain Misato Katsuragi, Operations Director of NERV, stopped typing on her keyboard and picked up her office phone, which was ringing again barely a minute after being hung up. She was already quite familiar with the cover-your-ass culture of bureaucrats, but it was hard not to be annoyed in a situation like this.  
NERV 作战部长葛城美里上尉停下了敲击键盘的手，拿起办公桌上再次响起的电话，距离上次挂断还不到一分钟。她对官僚们那种推卸责任的文化早已习以为常，但面对这样的情况，实在难以不感到恼火。 翻译文本：NERV 作战部长葛城美里上尉停下了敲击键盘的手，拿起办公桌上再次响起的电话，距离上次挂断还不到一分钟。她对官僚们那种推卸责任的文化早已习以为常，但面对这样的情况，实在难以不感到恼火。

"I keep telling you, Director, this is not an attempt to shift blame to your organization. All I want you to do is just fax-"  
"我一直跟您说，局长，这绝不是想把责任推到您的组织上。我只希望您能做的是——只需传真——"

"Eh, Captain Katsuragi?" The voice on the phone sounded confused and a little frightened. "This is Lieutenant Hyuga speaking."  
"呃，葛城队长？" 电话那头的声音听起来有些困惑和一丝惊慌。"我是副官伊吹蓝。"

Misato had to suppress a sigh. "Oh. Sorry. I thought you were someone else. What is it?"  
美里不得不忍住叹息。"哦，抱歉。我以为你是别人。有什么事吗？"

"Dr. Akagi called from the main ward. Shinji's LCL-reinforced treatment was successful, and now he's been moved to a general ward, she says."  
"赤木博士从主病房打来电话。她说真嗣的 LCL 强化治疗成功了，现在已经转到普通病房。"

So she handily fixed the multiple-organ failure caused by late treatment of severe heatstroke. But then again, the same treatment had worked wonders after the disaster that was the first sortie against the Fifth Angel. Feeling a heavy weight disappear from her chest, Misato sighed. The relief dissipated as she realized that something was off. "Good, but why did she call the command center, not me?"  
她轻松解决了因严重中暑晚期治疗导致的多个器官衰竭。不过话说回来，同样的治疗在第一次对抗第五使徒的灾难后也创造了奇迹。感到胸口的沉重消失，美里叹了口气。但随即意识到有些不对劲，她的轻松感消失了。"好，但她为什么不打给我，而是打到了指挥中心？"

"She did, but your cell phone was turned off and your office number was busy, so she called here instead. That's what she told me, anyway."  
"她打了，但你的手机关机了，办公室电话又占线，所以她才打到这里的。至少她是这么跟我说的。"

Misato put her hand in her pocket and fished out her cell phone. The battery was dead. She looked around for the charger, then realized that both it and the extra battery were in a suitcase stuck in the trunk of her car. Irritation flared up again.  
美里把手伸进口袋，掏出手机。电池已经没电了。她四处寻找充电器，随即意识到充电器和备用电池都塞在车后备箱的行李箱里。烦躁感再次涌上心头。

"Ah. Yeah, sorry, my battery died. Whoops." She considered asking about Shinji's condition, but decided to just call Ritsuko herself instead. Hyuga began to say something in answer, but she hung up without bothering to hear him out.  
“啊，是的，抱歉，我手机没电了。哎呀。”她本想询问真嗣的情况，但决定还是自己打电话给律子。日向正要回答什么，但她没耐心听完就挂断了电话。

Asuka Langley Soryu checked the small mirror attached to the locker wall. Clenched teeth and a red-hot face greeted her. Asuka wondered if Hikari would come back looking like this after her nice trip to Okinawa. She slammed the locker door with a rough clang, the anger that had been simmering for some time almost spilling over again. The sound echoed through NERV headquarters' pilot changing room, which she was using alone. It did little to improve her mood, but at least she didn't need to see her beet-red face anymore. It wasn't red purely out of anger.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷检查了挂在储物柜壁上的小镜子。紧咬的牙齿和涨红的脸映入眼帘。明日香心想，光在冲绳玩得那么开心，回来时会不会也这副模样。她用力甩上储物柜门，发出一声刺耳的撞击声，积压已久的怒火几乎又要爆发。这声音在 NERV 总部的驾驶员更衣室里回荡，此刻只有她一人使用。这并未改善她的心情，但至少不必再看到自己那张涨红的脸了。脸红并非全因愤怒。

She turned her head and looked at the red plugsuit sprawled limply on the bench. It looked like a person who had suddenly dropped dead, a shed skin with its deflated limbs all akimbo. A pool of LCL surrounded it, dripping steadily down to the floor with quiet _plinks_. It was heat-resistant, they said, specifically engineered to work under the most extreme conditions. Like diving into magma. What a joke. What was the use of a protective suit when her whole head was exposed? She raised her hand and touched her cheek. It felt hot. Maybe she shouldn't have thrown the ice pack on the shower room floor. She snorted, dismissing the thought. Regret was below her.  
她转过头，望向那件瘫软在长凳上的红色插头服。它宛如一个骤然倒毙的人，蜕下的皮囊四肢摊开，软绵无力。周围是一滩 LCL 溶液，静静地滴落至地板，发出细微的滴答声。据说这衣服耐高温，专为极端环境设计，仿佛能潜入岩浆一般。真是笑话。当头部完全暴露在外时，一件防护服又有何用？她抬起手，轻触脸颊，感觉滚烫。或许她不该把冰袋扔在淋浴间地板上。她嗤之以鼻，挥散了这念头。后悔不在她的选项之内。

The medic said there wouldn't be any scars or permanent nerve damage. Dr. Akagi's follow-up explanation was that the ridiculous protective suit worn by Unit-02 and the coolant that still remained even after the circulation cable was cut had worked to minimize the heat. But despite all that, by the time the emergency repairs on the crane had finished, Asuka had felt like she was getting boiled alive. After waddling out of the entry plug into the ridiculously cool midsummer air, she'd gagged for some time. It must have been a mild heat stroke symptom.  
医疗人员说不会留下任何疤痕或永久性神经损伤。赤木博士后续解释道，二号机所穿的荒谬防护服和即便循环电缆被切断后仍残留的冷却剂，共同作用以最大限度地减少热量。但尽管如此，当吊车的紧急维修完成后，明日香感觉自己仿佛被活活煮沸。她蹒跚地从插入栓中走出，迎面而来的是异常凉爽的仲夏空气，她一时间干呕不止。这想必是轻微中暑的症状。

And to think that Shinji had suffered through the same thing without any kind of protection…  
而想想真嗣在没有保护措施的情况下经历了同样的事情……

Asuka shuddered and headed to the locker room door.  
明日香打了个寒颤，朝更衣室门走去。

"You took your sweet time."  
"你可真是慢条斯理啊。"

It was the first thing Asuka heard after the automatic door whooshed closed behind her. She flinched, then the irritation came a beat later. She swallowed the angry words that crawled up her throat. "Oh, yeah, I needed to cool down with a cold shower. It was a bit hot today, right?" She turned her body halfway with a cheery air, a smirk on her lips and her chin drawn up. "What are you doing down here, Misato? I thought you were busy."  
自动门在她身后呼啸关闭后，这是明日香听到的第一句话。她一惊，随后怒气稍迟一步涌上心头。她咽下了涌到喉咙的愤怒话语。“哦，是啊，我需要用冷水澡冷静一下。今天有点热，对吧？”她半转身，带着欢快的神情，嘴角挂着一丝讥笑，下巴微微抬起。“你在这里做什么，美里？我以为你很忙。”

Dark eyebrows, almost purple under the bright light, knitted together. "I'm busy, yes. They're pretty upset up there. They're demanding a thorough after-action report by noon tomorrow."  
在明亮的灯光下，几乎呈紫色的浓眉紧锁。“我确实很忙。上面的人相当不满。他们要求明天中午前提交一份详尽的行动后报告。”

_Yeah, and I already asked why a busy person like you came all the way down here,_ Asuka almost shot back. Her Japanese housemates were really frustrating at times, but not everyone could be a genius like the great Asuka Langley Soryu, so she'd have to excuse them, she supposed. Especially on a tiring day like today. Some redundant and inefficient conversations were to be expected.  
是啊，我之前还问过你，像你这么忙的人怎么会特意跑来这里，明日香几乎要反唇相讥。她的日本室友们有时候真是让人头疼，但不是每个人都能像伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷那样天才，所以她想自己得原谅他们。尤其是在像今天这样疲惫的日子里。有些多余且低效的对话是难免的。

"So what is it? You need my help or something?"  
“那到底是什么事？你需要我帮忙还是怎么的？”

"I need to debrief you to complete part of the report, but you're not willing to cooperate, are you?"  
“我需要向你汇报以完成报告的一部分，但你不愿意配合，对吧？”

Asuka smiled happily. "Just make something up, like you did on my psych reports back in Germany."  
明日香开心地笑了。“随便编点什么吧，就像你在德国时给我的心理报告那样。”

Misato's eyes widened and she was at a loss for words for a moment. She scratched the back of her head with an awkward smile. "You knew about that?"  
美里瞪大了眼睛，一时语塞。她尴尬地挠了挠后脑勺，笑着说：“你知道那件事？”

_You're more transparent than you think you are.I can see through all your bullshit,_ Asuka didn't say. Instead she just smiled her sweetest smile, the same one that melted so many clueless boys' hearts at school.  
你比你想象的要透明得多。我一眼就能看穿你那些胡扯，明日香没说出口。相反，她只是露出了最甜美的微笑，那笑容曾在学校里让无数懵懂少男心融化。

"Anything else? Did you come to take me home? What about the idiot?" Asuka nodded slightly to herself, thinking the question was subtle enough. Misato just looked at her with a strange expression, not answering.  
"还有别的吗？你是来带我回家的吗？那傻瓜呢？" 明日香微微点头自问，觉得这个问题够隐晦了。美里只是带着奇怪的表情看着她，没有回答。

Asuka didn't like it. 明日香不喜欢这样。

After about three slow breaths of silence Asuka's throat dried up, and the smile on her face was about to crack. Only then did Misato smile softly. "He's still unconscious, but he's largely stable from what I've heard. They already transferred him to a general ward. You should come with me."  
大约在三下缓慢的呼吸沉默之后，明日香的喉咙干涸了，她脸上的笑容几乎要裂开。直到那时，美里才温柔地笑了笑。"他还未苏醒，但据我所知，他的情况基本稳定。他们已经把他转到了普通病房。你应该跟我来。"

Asuka didn't like this either.  
明日香对此也不喜欢。

First, she didn't like this 'should come' nonsense, implying that she had some kind of an obligation to visit him. Second, she didn't like the face that Misato was making; it was entirely too smug. And the third and biggest reason: she didn't like the fact that she cared this much about the whole stupid matter.  
首先，她不喜欢这种‘应该来’的胡言乱语，暗示她有某种义务去探望他。其次，她不喜欢美里那副得意洋洋的表情；那表情太过自满了。而第三点，也是最重要的一点：她不喜欢自己对这件愚蠢的事情如此在意。

Asuka shrugged, erasing the smile from her face before it collapsed on its own.  
明日香耸了耸肩，在笑容自行崩塌之前先将其抹去。

_"I'm_ the someone who should go? Shouldn't that be you, Misato? You know, the one who commanded an unprotected Eva to jump into a volcano and didn't even provide proper support afterwards? Not that I'm not grateful, mind you, I might just visit him and say hello later. I just don't think I have any obligation to drag my half-boiled body to him right now and collapse on his sleeping knees or something."  
“我才是该去的那个人吗？不应该是你吗，美里？你可是指挥了一台毫无保护的 EVA 跳进火山，事后连适当支援都没提供的那位啊？别误会，我可不是不感激，晚点我可能会去拜访他并打个招呼。只是我觉得现在没义务拖着半熟的身体去他那儿，然后瘫倒在他的睡膝上之类的。”

Skipping the visit was actually the opposite of what she really wanted, but she wasn't about to admit it and give Misato the satisfaction after that smug, know-it-all look she gave her. Asuka knew her logic was flimsy, but at this point it was too late to back down. Misato was probably going to argue that if she was responsible for the whole thing, then Asuka should be grateful to her at the very least and do her this one stupid favor. Or she might say that the responsibility had nothing to do with visiting a wounded fellow pilot but was rather that of visiting a friend. Or _maybe_ she'd just smirk again and say that Asuka didn't look _too_ uncomfortable, surely you're not that tired already! Asuka quickly prepared rebuttals for all of them, aiming to at least save her dignity by the end of this. But Misato's reply was something completely outside of Asuka's expectations.  
跳过这次探访实际上与她真正想要的背道而驰，但她绝不会承认这一点，尤其是在美里那副自鸣得意、无所不知的表情之后。明日香知道自己的逻辑站不住脚，但事到如今已经无法退缩。美里大概会争辩说，既然她对整件事负责，那么明日香至少应该感激她，为她做这件愚蠢的事。或者她可能会说，责任与探望受伤的同僚无关，而是探望一个朋友。又或许她会再次露出那种得意的笑容，说你看起来并不太难受，总不会这么快就累了吧！明日香迅速为每种可能准备了反驳，试图至少在这件事结束时保住自己的尊严。但美里的回答完全出乎明日香的意料。

The older woman smiled bitterly. "So you didn't know."  
年长的女人苦涩地笑了笑。"这么说你不知道。"

Asuka tilted her head slightly, face guarded. "I didn't know what?"  
明日香微微侧头，表情戒备。"我不知道什么？"

"He didn't jump in there on my orders. I didn't have time to order him to do _anything._ It all happened too quickly."  
"他不是听我的命令跳进去的。我根本没时间命令他做任何事。一切都发生得太快了。"

Asuka frowned, opened her mouth to speak, closed it, and opened it again. "Well, whatever. I'm going home. I want some rest."  
明日香皱了皱眉，张嘴想说些什么，又闭上了，再次张开。“算了，不管了。我要回家。我需要休息。”

Misato crossed her arms. Asuka raised her chin ever so slightly and looked away. After a few seconds of Asuka stubbornly avoiding looking at Misato, Misato sighed and un-crossed her arms.  
美里交叉双臂。明日香微微扬起下巴，转过头去。几秒钟后，明日香倔强地避开美里的目光，美里叹了口气，放下了双臂。

"Sure. I'm working overnight today. You'll have to buy takeout or something for dinner. Want some cash?"  
“当然，我今晚要通宵工作。你得自己买外卖或者别的什么当晚餐。需要现金吗？”

Common sense would have her take the money, but Asuka shook her head, not wanting to accept Misato's charity. "No. So what, you're not giving me a ride?"  
按常理她应该收下钱，但明日香摇了摇头，不想接受美里这种施舍。“不用了。那什么，你不送我一程吗？”

"I'm sorry, I'm too busy. I'd rather not hit the road during rush hour."  
“抱歉，我太忙了。我可不想在高峰时段开车。”

Snorting, Asuka tossed her hair over her shoulder with one hand. It was damp and heavy. "Alright, whatever. See you tomorrow."  
哼了一声，明日香单手将湿漉漉的头发甩到肩后。“好吧，随你。明天见。”

"Yeah, be safe. By the way, great job today, Asuka."  
“嗯，注意安全。顺便说一句，今天干得漂亮，明日香。”

Asuka took two steps in the direction of the elevator without answering, then stopped and turned back toward Misato. Come to think of it, there was something weird about this exchange.  
明日香朝电梯方向走了两步，没有回应，随即停下脚步，转身面向美里。话说回来，这次对话有点奇怪。

"You could've just called me if you weren't going to give me a ride."  
"你本可以给我打电话的，如果你不打算载我一程的话。"

"My cell phone ran out of battery. Oh, right. How about yours? Do you have a charger at home? Want me to get one from the car?"  
"我的手机没电了。哦，对了。你的呢？家里有充电器吗？要不要我从车里拿一个过来？"

"It's alright. I have a spare in my room. Unlike _some people_ I'm well prepared for emergencies."  
"没事。我房间里有个备用的。不像某些人，我可是为紧急情况做好了准备的。"

After parting ways with Misato, Asuka took the elevator around the corner and narrowed her eyes, thinking about the conversation. Even if the cell phone was out, she could still have used her office phone or one of the many phones dotting HQ. Just pick one up and tell Asuka where Shinji is, offering to meet up with her somewhere or something. The fact that she came down here probably meant that Misato couldn't remember Asuka's number and didn't write it down anywhere either. It was the same when they were in Germany. She used to listen to Asuka's occasional small talk with a bright smile, making enthusiastic noises in all the right places, but the next day she would ask the same questions, plainly not having listened to anything Asuka told her. That was the kind of person Misato was.  
与美里分别后，明日香绕过转角走进电梯，眯起眼睛回想着刚才的对话。即便手机不在身边，她本也可以使用办公室的电话或总部随处可见的任意一部电话。只需拿起一个，告诉明日香真嗣在哪里，提议在某处见面或做些什么。她特意下楼来找自己，大概意味着美里不记得明日香的号码，也没在任何地方记下来。在德国时也是如此。她曾带着灿烂的笑容倾听明日香偶尔的闲聊，在恰当的时刻发出热情的回应声，但第二天又会问同样的问题，显然根本没把明日香的话听进去。美里就是这样的人。

Numbers ticked by as the elevator rose to the Geofront, and Asuka's old disdain rose with it. What exactly Mr. Kaji saw in that shallow woman, she would never know. But then again, that must be why he broke up with her in the first place.  
随着电梯向地底都市上升，数字逐一跳动，明日香心中对美里的旧日轻蔑也随之升起。究竟加治先生看上了那个肤浅女人哪一点，她永远无从得知。但话说回来，这或许正是他当初与她分手的原因。

That gave Asuka an idea. She pulled her cell phone out as soon as the elevator stopped and she exited. There were several messages from Hikari, but she didn't check them. They weren't important now.  
这给了明日香一个主意。电梯一停，她便匆匆走出，随即掏出手机。屏幕上显示着光的几条信息，但她没有查看。现在这些都不重要了。

_Mr. Kaji! Are you available by any chance? -Your Asuka 3  
加持先生！您现在有空吗？-您的明日香 3_

Just before pressing the send button, she considered writing everything out immediately. Maybe he could give her a ride home, and if he wasn't too busy, maybe get dinner with her. But she soon scrapped the idea. The more messages exchanged with Mr. Kaji, the better, even if it was a little inefficient. She looked at the message again. Maybe the heart was a bit much, considering how her last major advance ended, but she hurriedly pushed that thought to the dark corner of her mind and hit send.  
就在按下发送键之前，她考虑过立刻把所有事情写出来。或许他能载她回家，如果他不太忙的话，或许还能一起吃个晚饭。但她很快打消了这个念头。与加持先生多交流总是好的，哪怕这种方式有些低效。她再次审视那条信息。或许那个心形符号有点过了，考虑到她上一次的大胆举动的结果，但她急忙将这个念头抛到脑海的角落，然后发送了出去。

Even after Asuka arrived at the surface-bound station crowded with NERV employees, even after she didn't board the first train that arrived as she entered the platform, Mr. Kaji didn't answer. She sat down on a bench, waiting for his message. Two more trains came and went. By the time the fourth one came she gave up and took it, her mood foul.  
即使明日香到达了挤满 NERV 员工的地面车站，即使她没有登上进入月台后第一辆到站的列车，加持先生也没有回复。她坐在长椅上，等待着他的消息。又有两辆列车来了又走。等到第四辆来时，她放弃了，心情恶劣地上了车。

The passengers busily boarding and disembarking, the vast expanse of the Geofront, the glittering city above it, the bustling suburb that greeted her after she got off the station near Misato's apartment building - all of it filled her with a strange feeling that she couldn't quite find the words to describe. The war for humanity's existence was raging in this city, and one of their guardians - no, _two_ of their guardians almost died a gruesome death today, but Tokyo-3 and its inhabitants didn't look any different from yesterday. Even if Asuka had ended up dying a few hours ago, all of these people would be doing the exact same thing they're doing now, like nothing ever happened.  
乘客们忙碌地上车下车，广阔的 Geofront，上方闪耀的城市，以及她从米萨托公寓附近的地铁站出来后迎接她的繁华郊区——这一切都让她感到一种难以言喻的奇异感觉。人类生存之战正在这座城市中激烈进行，而他们的守护者之一——不，两位守护者今天几乎惨死，但东京-3 及其居民看起来与昨天并无二致。即使明日香在几小时前死去，所有这些人也会做着现在正在做的同样的事情，仿佛什么都没发生过。

Asuka took a step forward, pushing those thoughts down to a dark corner of her mind.  
明日香向前迈出一步，将这些思绪压入心底的黑暗角落。

She walked a few blocks without a specific destination in mind in the suffocating late afternoon heat. She was not completely familiar with the surrounding area yet, but she knew that she was walking away from home. But there weren't any restaurants to speak of near the apartment, so it didn't matter.  
她在闷热的傍晚时分漫无目的地走了几个街区。她对周围的环境并不完全熟悉，但她知道自己正在远离家。不过，公寓附近并没有什么餐馆，所以这并不重要。

Walking aimlessly, she started to feel people's eyes on her, like she usually did. Sometimes blatant, sometimes a passing glance, sometimes looking away hastily as if ashamed. Dark-haired dark-eyed people whose interest was briefly piqued by the novelty of her red hair and foreign features.  
漫无目的地走着，她开始感觉到人们的目光，就像她通常所感受到的那样。有时是直白的，有时是匆匆一瞥，有时则是迅速移开视线，仿佛感到羞愧。那些黑发黑眼的人们，因她那红发和异国特征的新奇而短暂地引起了兴趣。

Only after Asuka ordered from a gyudon take-out shop, attracted by the smell rather than the sign, which she couldn't read anyway, did Mr. Kaji's reply come.  
直到明日香在一家牛丼外卖店点餐，是被香味吸引而非招牌，毕竟她根本看不懂招牌上的字，加持先生的回复才姗姗来迟。

_I'm out of town today, work-related. What's up?  
我今天出差，工作原因。有什么事吗？_

She tried to write down the answer but the counter called her waiting number. She left the store with her dinner clutched in one hand and tapping at her phone with the other.  
她试图记下答案，但柜台叫到了她的号码。她一手紧握着晚餐，另一手在手机上敲打着，离开了商店。

_That's too bad. I was wondering if we could have dinner today, just the two of us, and then some car date after  
那太遗憾了。我在想我们今天能不能一起吃个晚饭，就我们俩，然后再来个车里约会。_

Asuka realized that she didn't double-check her kanji conversions only after sending the text, making her tremble at the thought of possible mistakes, but Mr. Kaji replied before she could worry too much about it. Maybe he was dinner-texting, considering the time.  
明日香意识到自己发送前没有再次检查汉字转换，这让她想到可能的错误时颤抖不已，但加治先生在她过多担忧之前就回复了。或许他是边吃晚餐边发短信，考虑到时间。

_Well, that's a shame. Still, I'm glad our little lady seems fine. Heard it was rough today.  
哎，真遗憾。不过，很高兴我们的小姑娘看起来没事。听说今天挺艰难的。_

This was a little disappointing. Asuka wasn't a 'little lady', and she definitely wasn't fine. Biting her lips slightly, she slipped her arm through the loops in the plastic take-out bag and started texting furiously with both hands. The heavy gyudon bag swung sideways.  
这有点令人失望。明日香可不是什么'小姑娘'，她绝对不好。她轻轻咬着嘴唇，将手臂穿过塑料外卖袋的环扣，双手疯狂地打字。沉甸甸的牛肉盖饭袋子左右摇晃。

_Oh, but it's not a proper achievement at all if there isn't any challenge, especially for my historic first solo kill. But it's not like it was actually dangerous or something. Ah~ if you took me out today you could've heard all the details in person! Your loss, Mr. Kaji.  
哦，如果没有挑战，那就根本算不上真正的成就，尤其是对我历史性的首次单杀来说。不过，这并不意味着真的有什么危险。啊~ 如果你今天在场，就能亲耳听到所有细节了！可惜了，加治先生。_

It wasn't until she sent the message that she realized she hadn't mentioned the person who went through the same 'danger' and definitely wasn't fine now. That felt like it was a little too cold even to her. What would Mr. Kaji think? She made herself look like a crass brat. _If he asks about him in the next text, I'll tell him,_ she thought, stopping in front of the crosswalk.  
直到她发出消息后，她才意识到自己并未提及那个同样经历了所谓“危险”、现在肯定安然无恙的人。这让她感觉自己未免太过冷漠。加治先生会怎么想呢？她觉得自己像个粗鲁的小孩。如果他在下一条消息中问起他，我会告诉他的，她想着，在人行横道前停下脚步。

But there was no mention of Shinji in his next message.  
但在他的下一条消息中，并没有提到真嗣。

_Is he not interested?_ But that wasn't very convincing. Mr. Kaji was a considerate gentleman, the only respectable man Asuka had ever met in her life. He must've already heard everything from Misato or something. Asuka's attention shifted to the other part of his text.  
他难道不感兴趣吗？但这听起来不太有说服力。加治先生是个体贴的绅士，是明日香一生中遇到过的唯一一位值得尊敬的人。他肯定已经从美里那里听说了所有的事情。明日香的注意力转向了他信息中的另一部分。

_Next time? When? Will you buy me beer like last time? I'm always available!_ Asuka happily texted.  
下次？什么时候？你会像上次那样请我喝啤酒吗？我随时都有空！明日香开心地回复道。

The answer seemed to be a little delayed again, but she still entered the empty apartment feeling better than before.  
回复似乎又有点延迟，但她走进空荡荡的公寓时，感觉比之前好多了。

---

The air in the house felt stale when Asuka opened the door with her key card. Leaving her dinner on the table, she walked around the house to open all the windows, ignoring the annoying penguin following at her heels. The wind blowing in wasn't particularly cool, but it was fresh at the very least. She sighed and headed back to the table, looking out at the orange-colored sky.  
当明日香用她的钥匙卡打开门时，屋内的空气感觉沉闷。她把晚餐留在桌上，绕着屋子打开所有窗户，无视那只烦人的企鹅跟在她脚后。吹进来的风并不特别凉爽，但至少是新鲜的。她叹了口气，回到桌前，望向橙色的天空。

The penguin started nipping at her feet. This was the last straw. She whirled on him, incensed.  
那只企鹅开始咬她的脚。这真是忍无可忍。她猛地转身，怒火中烧。

"What the hell is wrong with you!"  
“你到底有什么毛病！”

The beast lifted his wing to point his bowl in one corner. Asuka groaned and half-heartedly searched through the cupboards and the refrigerator, but the cans of fish Shinji usually fed to the bird were nowhere to be seen. She admittedly didn't look very hard, but in her opinion it was enough. "Wait. I want to eat mine first."  
那只兽抬起翅膀指向角落里的碗。明日香叹了口气，半心半意地在橱柜和冰箱里翻找，但通常真嗣喂给鸟的鱼罐头却不见踪影。她承认自己没怎么认真找，但在她看来已经足够了。“等等。我想先吃我的。”

Asuka started her own dinner. Pen-pen watched her, unimpressed. She opened her cell phone and checked, but Mr. Kaji still hadn't answered her last text. So Asuka opened the texts from Hikari that she'd ignored earlier. Some boring talks about the Okinawan beach and Okinawan food, timestamped every few hours. There was nothing interesting, except for the last one.  
明日香开始准备自己的晚餐。Pen-pen 看着她，一脸不以为然。她打开手机查看，但加持先生仍未回复她最后一条短信。于是明日香打开了之前忽略的光发来的短信。一些关于冲绳海滩和冲绳食物的无聊话题，每隔几小时就有一个时间戳。没什么有趣的，除了最后一条。

_Asuka, are you busy? I think I should buy some souvenirs for Ikari and Ayanami too. I think it wouldn't be appropriate for me, as a class representative, to just buy something for you only, when all three of you had to stay behind for the same reason. But what should I buy for Ikari? What does he like?  
明日香，你忙吗？我觉得我也应该给真嗣和绫波买点纪念品。作为班长，只给你一个人买东西似乎不太合适，毕竟你们三个都是因为同样的原因留了下来。但我该给真嗣买什么呢？他喜欢什么？_

"How should I know?" Asuka muttered.  
“我怎么知道？”明日香嘟囔道。

Did Hikari think that she and Shinji were close because they were forced to live under the same roof? It wasn't like Asuka had known him for very long.  
难道光认为她和真嗣关系亲近是因为被迫住在同一个屋檐下？又不是说她和真嗣认识很久了。

_Besides,_ Asuka thought in disgust. _Why would you buy a gift for Stupid Shinji?_ Her fingers started moving over the phone again.  
再说了，明日香厌恶地想。为什么要给笨蛋真嗣买礼物？她的手指又开始在手机上滑动。

_Wow, I want to try that Champuru thing too! I heard Okinawan food is very different from mainland Japan's, very exotic. You're making me jealous! Oh and the gift, I think it would be better if you didn't buy him anything at all. He's more Japanese than even you, you know. He'll feel stressed and pressured to pay you back somehow and all that nonsense. You know what I mean, right?  
哇，我也想试试那个 Champuru！听说冲绳料理和日本本土的很不一样，非常异域风情。你让我嫉妒了！哦，还有礼物，我觉得你最好不要给他买任何东西。他比你还要日本化，你知道的。他会感到有压力，觉得必须以某种方式回报你，那些乱七八糟的事。你懂我的意思吧？_

It was a pretty well thought out answer. Asuka put her phone down, proud of her ability to navigate these situations with ease.  
这是一个相当周全的回答。明日香放下手机，对自己能轻松应对这些情况感到自豪。

Her phone rang again when she was putting the takeout container in the trash can after finishing the meal. She excitedly checked it, only to be a little disappointed to see that it was Hikari, not Mr. Kaji.  
她吃完饭后把外卖盒扔进垃圾桶时，手机又响了。她兴奋地查看，却发现是光，而不是加治先生，有点失望。

_That sounds right, haha. You're close to Ikari, I'll trust your judgment. But what about Ayanami? It would be too weird if I just buy something for her and not Ikari, right?  
听起来没错，哈哈。你和碇很亲近，我相信你的判断。但绫波怎么办？如果我只给她买东西而不给碇买，会不会太奇怪了？_

Sighing, Asuka snapped her phone shut. _Stop worrying so much, Hikari._  
叹了口气，明日香啪的一声合上了手机。别担心那么多，光。

Soon, the late summer sun finally sank beneath the horizon, leaving the house dim. Asuka changed into comfortable clothes, finally found Pen-pen's canned fish and fed it to him, and then sat herself in front of the living room TV. There was some kind of Japanese reality show on, everyone chattering loudly and happily. Captions, faces, and bright flashing lights filled every corner of the screen. Total information overload.  
不久，夏末的太阳终于沉入地平线，屋内变得昏暗。明日香换上舒适的衣物，终于找到了 Pen-pen 的罐头鱼并喂给了它，然后坐在客厅的电视机前。屏幕上播放着某种日本真人秀节目，人们大声而愉快地交谈着。字幕、面孔和闪烁的亮光填满了屏幕的每个角落。信息量完全超载。

_Why are they doing that,_ Asuka wondered. It was probably because they weren't confident in the contents of the program itself, so they needed to put faces and captions to meticulously indicate what emotions the viewers should be feeling at any given time. The kind of people who watched these things probably didn't even have control of themselves. They needed to be told what they should feel.  
为什么他们要这么做，明日香感到疑惑。大概是因为他们对节目内容本身缺乏信心，所以需要用面孔和字幕来细致地指示观众在任何时刻应该感受到的情绪。那些看这类节目的人可能连自我控制都没有，他们需要被告知应该有什么样的感受。

Feeling utterly disgusted, Asuka turned off the TV.  
感到极度厌恶，明日香关掉了电视。

The sound of cicadas filled the void left by the exaggerated fake laughter and too-cheery rambling from the TV. Asuka flopped down on the living room floor and closed her eyes. No one contacted her after the dinner, not Hikari, nor Mr. Kaji, nor Misato, nor anyone else. Not that there was anyone else. Pen-pen was in his refrigerator. The house was empty.  
蝉鸣声填满了电视中夸张的假笑和过于欢快的闲聊留下的空白。明日香倒在客厅地板上，闭上了眼睛。晚餐后没有人联系她，无论是光、加持先生、美里，还是其他任何人。其实也没有其他人了。Pen-pen 在他的冰箱里。房子空荡荡的。

This was normal to her not too long ago. A few hours in the evening before bedtime, spent utterly alone in her NERV Berlin headquarters with no one to talk to. Sometimes Mr. Kaji would call her, if she was lucky.  
这在不久前对她来说还是常态。睡前几个小时的傍晚，独自一人待在 NERV 柏林总部，无人可交谈。有时，如果幸运的话，加吉先生会给她打电话。

Suddenly, she realized she hated this.  
突然，她意识到她讨厌这样。

And she hated the fact that she hated it.  
而她更讨厌自己讨厌这一点的事实。

Asuka's face began to heat up little by little. The phantom pain from the volcano, flaring up again. Phantom pain was, like loneliness, a familiar companion from childhood. Human brains were not designed to synchronize with giant robots, so residual neural feedback was only natural, or so they said.  
明日香的脸颊一点点热了起来。那来自火山的幻痛，再次燃起。幻痛，如同孤独，是自童年便熟悉的伴侣。人类的大脑本就不是为与巨型机器人同步而设计的，因此残留的神经反馈不过是自然而然的事，他们如是说。

Asuka sat up. What should she do now? The trainers at the Berlin branch taught her how to cope with the sensations of being cut or stabbed or bruised, but the feeling of being slowly boiled alive was something they had neglected to mention. They probably weren't imaginative enough to realize she'd ever be getting burnt in the first place.  
明日香坐起身来。现在她该怎么办？柏林分部的训练师们教过她如何应对切割、刺伤或瘀伤的感觉，但那种慢慢被活活煮沸的感觉，却是他们未曾提及的。他们大概想象力不够，没想到她会首先遭遇烧伤。

But Asuka Langley Soryu was a genius, and was soon able to come up with a plan. She jogged to her room and opened the vanity drawer, only to realize that the box of sheet masks was in the trunk of Misato's car, packed in her suitcase for the aborted onsen trip. Clicking her tongue, Asuka headed to Misato's room. Even in the room that was chaos incarnate, she was able to find Misato's sheet masks approximately near her vanity. She put it in the refrigerator and washed her face with warm water, brushed her teeth, and sat in front of her mirror a few minutes later.  
但惣流·明日香·兰格雷是个天才，很快就想出了一个计划。她小跑回自己的房间，打开梳妆台抽屉，却发现那盒面膜在美里车的后备箱里，原本为了那次未成行的温泉之旅而打包在行李箱中。明日香咂了咂舌，朝美里的房间走去。即便在那个混乱至极的房间里，她还是在梳妆台附近找到了美里的面膜。她把面膜放进冰箱，用温水洗脸，刷了牙，几分钟后坐在镜子前。

It worked. Quite well. She checked the edges of the mask in the mirror, sighing in relief. Then she opened her cell phone again. Nothing, as expected. She turned to the mirror again. The face in the mirror was cold. Unyielding. Alien. Abruptly, disgust curdled in her stomach. She ripped off the mask and threw it into the trash can.  
效果不错。相当好。她在镜中检查面膜的边缘，松了口气。然后她再次打开手机。如预期般，什么也没有。她又转向镜子。镜中的脸冷漠。坚定。异样。突然间，一阵厌恶在胃里翻腾。她撕下面膜，扔进了垃圾桶。

Then she turned off the lights and lay down in her bed, but sleep didn't come that easily.  
接着她关掉灯，躺在床上，但睡眠并未轻易降临。

The thought of masturbating hit her suddenly. It was a rare chance: she had the whole house to herself for once. A golden opportunity. She halfheartedly slipped her hand down her pants, conjuring up an image of Mr. Kaji, shirtless and smiling, but her heart wasn't really in it. With a sigh, she rolled over, yanking her underwear back into place.  
自慰的念头突然袭来。这是个难得的机会：她终于独自一人占据了整个房子。黄金时刻。她半心半意地把手滑进裤子里，想象着赤裸上身、微笑着的加持先生，但她的心思并不在此。叹了口气，她翻身躺下，拉回了内裤。

The heat began to return to the face, now that the sheet mask was gone. She began to feel the pressure, too, smothering her body from every direction. At some point the constant sound of cicadas began to turn into a low-pitched, dull roar that made her ears ring as if she were diving into a swimming pool. A swimming pool as big as a cavern, filled with magma instead of water. Asuka winced and hugged herself. She blinked. In the brief moment her eyes were shut, she'd been transported back into the entry plug.  
随着面膜的消失，热度开始回到脸上。她也感到了压力，从四面八方压迫着她的身体。不知何时，蝉鸣声逐渐变成了低沉的轰鸣，让她的耳朵嗡嗡作响，仿佛潜入了游泳池。一个像洞穴一样大的游泳池，里面充满了岩浆而非水。明日香皱眉抱紧自己。她眨了眨眼。在闭眼的短暂瞬间，她仿佛回到了插入栓中。

The awful swooping sensation in her gut at the feeling of falling. The reality of death, freezing her heart for a moment.  
那种令人作呕的下坠感在胃里翻腾。死亡的现实，让她的心脏瞬间冻结。

Then a sudden stop. Muttering.  
然后突然停下。低声抱怨。

_Idiot, you got a death wish?  
白痴，你想找死吗？_

The heat, already overwhelming by then.  
那时，炎热已经让人难以忍受。

The feeling of her shoulder almost ripping out as she was dragged up by Unit-01's hand.  
被初号机之手拽起时，肩膀几乎要撕裂的感觉。

Shinji, crackling to life in the video feed, brows furrowed: _geez, Asuka, you're way too heavy._ Joking like that was a complete surprise from the usually dull idiot. She'd hidden her delight behind angry words, and then he'd ruined it by stammering and apologizing like he always did.  
视频画面中，真嗣的声音噼啪作响，眉头紧皱：天哪，明日香，你太重了。像这样开玩笑完全出乎意料，毕竟他平时是个无趣的傻瓜。她把喜悦藏在愤怒的话语背后，而他却像往常一样结巴道歉，破坏了气氛。

(Maybe it wasn't a joke, come to think of it. Maybe he was just being serious and got intimidated by her reaction. Asuka grimaced.)  
（也许那不是玩笑，仔细想想。或许他只是认真地说，却被她的反应吓到了。明日香皱起了眉头。）

The beat of confusion when they stopped moving. The radio chattered something about a voltage problem on the 's voice was gradually losing confidence, Shinji's answers were getting shorter and simpler as time went on…  
他们停止移动时，混乱的节奏。电台里传来关于电压问题的嘈杂声，声音逐渐失去信心，随着时间的推移，真嗣的回答变得越来越简短和简单……

Asuka blinked. In the communication window, Shinji's head drooped. At that point she had long forgotten the boiling temperature of her own entry plug. "Shinji!" she'd called out, not caring about the way fear blatantly filled her voice. "_Shinji!"_  
明日香眨了眨眼。在通讯窗口中，真嗣的头低垂着。那时她早已忘记了自身插入栓内沸腾的温度。“真嗣！”她喊道，毫不掩饰声音中的恐惧。“真嗣！”

"Unit-01 pilot unconscious!" someone was shouting over the radio.  
“初号机驾驶员失去意识！”电台里有人大喊。

Then she felt something that made her blood run cold. The fingers of Unit-01 had gone limp, the pressure of them vanished from around her hand, letting her go. The next moment she was falling, falling, falling into the abyss…  
随后她感到一种令她血液凝固的触感。初号机的手指变得无力，环绕她手的压力消失了，任由她挣脱。下一刻，她正坠落，坠落，坠入深渊……

Asuka gasped, waking up on a sheet soaked with sweat. A notification was flashing from her cell phone, placed carelessly on the nightstand. With a trembling hand she reached out and opened it. Mr. Kaji's name did little to relieve her.  
明日香喘息着醒来，身下的床单已被汗水浸透。手机上有一条闪烁的通知，随意地放在床头柜上。她颤抖着手伸过去打开。看到加持先生的名字，她的心情并未因此缓解。

_Asuka, I forgot to say this earlier. You're doing a commendable thing. Be proud of yourself. Good night.  
明日香，我之前忘了说。你做得很好，为自己感到骄傲吧。晚安。_

Asuka read the text with blank eyes for a moment, then ground her teeth and threw away the phone.  
明日香空洞地盯着短信看了一会儿，随即咬紧牙关，将手机扔了出去。

_You're just saying that to make yourself feel better. You're nowhere to be found when I need you. Not during the 6th Angel. Not today.  
你这么说只是为了让自己好受些。我需要你的时候你总是不在。第六使徒来袭时不在，今天也不在。_

Asuka turned her body to the less wet part of the sheet and closed her eyes again. It was then that she realized.  
明日香转身面向床单上较为干燥的一侧，再次闭上了眼睛。就在这时，她意识到了。

Her flashback wasn't real. In the end, Shinji didn't let her go until she was safe.  
她的闪回并非真实。最终，真嗣直到她安全无虞才放手。

### Chapter 3 A lost boy

A/N: Glass of the Wine Rebuilt by Toasterman is one of the inspirations of this fic, yes. Some ideas it used were too charming to not utilize, although I'm still aiming for something (hopefully) original enough.  
作者注：《酒之重生》（Glass of the Wine Rebuilt）由 Toasterman 所著，确实是本文的灵感来源之一。其中一些构思太过迷人，难以割舍，尽管我仍力求创作出（希望）足够原创的内容。

Another unfamiliar ceiling.  
又是一片陌生的天花板。

Shinji Ikari almost wanted to laugh at himself, thinking this waking-up-under-an-unfamiliar-ceiling thing had reached an absurd level, but soon he had to close his eyes again and lay his neck on the pillow as an onslaught of vertigo swallowed him. It was a slightly different feeling than the torpor one usually felt right before a good night's sleep. His head felt like it was swimming in a cloud, but there was nothing cozy about it. He clenched his jaw weakly and grunted as his head throbbed and the tips of his limbs all tingled unpleasantly. Slowly, like puzzle pieces putting themselves together on their own, he remembered how he ended up here.  
碇真嗣几乎想嘲笑自己，觉得这种醒来在陌生天花板下的情况已经到了荒谬的地步，但很快他又不得不闭上眼睛，将脖子靠在枕头上，因为一阵眩晕如潮水般吞没了他。这种感觉与通常在进入甜美梦乡前的那种困倦感略有不同。他的头仿佛在云端游荡，却毫无舒适可言。他无力地咬紧牙关，发出低沉的呻吟，随着头痛和四肢末端不愉快的刺痛感，他慢慢地，像拼图碎片自行组合一般，回忆起了自己如何来到这里。

The heat, slowly tightening around his body, leaving him nowhere to escape.  
那股热浪，缓缓地缠绕在他身上，无处可逃。

The reality of death, right in front of his face.  
死亡的现实，就摆在他眼前。

As he shuddered in a fear that he doubted he could ever get used to, he heard a rustling sound next to his bed.  
当他因恐惧而颤抖，怀疑自己是否能习惯这种感觉时，他听到床边传来一阵窸窣声。

"You're awake. How are you feeling?" A sweet voice, almost motherly. It sounded familiar, but the tone was one he wasn't used to. He struggled to turn his head. Ayanami sat in a folding chair, looking down at him with her usual indifferent expression. There was no school today, but she was still clad in her uniform. Her pale face was lit up by harsh sunlight pouring through the window directly across from her. It made her seem otherworldly, almost inhuman. Shinji blinked at the sight. He was sure it was…  
“你醒了。感觉怎么样？”一个甜美的声音，几乎带着母性的关怀。听起来很熟悉，但语气却是他不习惯的。他费力地转过头。绫波坐在一把折叠椅上，一如既往地带着冷漠的表情俯视着他。今天没有上学，但她仍然穿着校服。她苍白的脸被从对面窗户直射进来的强烈阳光照亮。这让她显得超凡脱俗，几乎不像人类。真嗣对着这一幕眨了眨眼。他确信这是……

As he blinked a few times, his blurred vision cleared a little, and he realized that the vaguely red blob behind Ayanami was actually Misato in her jacket.  
他眨了几下眼，模糊的视线稍稍清晰了一些，这才意识到绫波身后那个隐约的红色影子其实是穿着夹克的美里。

_What about Asuka?_ he tried to ask, but only a dry groan came out of his mouth. He was very thirsty, something he didn't realize until now. Misato closed the cell phone in her hand with a snap, walked to the bedside, picked up the water bottle on the side table, and poured it into the cup that was sitting next to it. Under Ayanami's indifferent supervision, Shinji moistened his lips as Misato tilted the cup for him. The stiff patient gown he was wearing rustled against his chest. After gulping down the whole cup, he cleared his throat and opened his mouth again.  
那明日香呢？他想问，但嘴里只发出了一声干涩的呻吟。他非常口渴，直到此刻才意识到。美里啪的一声合上手中的手机，走到床边，拿起旁边小桌上的水瓶，倒进了旁边的杯子里。在绫波冷漠的注视下，真嗣在美里倾斜杯子时润了润嘴唇。他身上僵硬的病号服摩擦着胸口。喝完整杯水后，他清了清嗓子，再次开口。

"What about Asuka?" “明日香呢？”

The corners of Misato's lips curved upwards in a gentle smile, but she didn't answer. Shinji looked at her beseechingly. That smile didn't do much to assuage the anxiety beginning to build in his chest.  
Misato 的嘴角微微上扬，露出一抹温柔的微笑，但她并未作答。Shinji 恳切地望着她。那笑容并未能缓解他胸中逐渐升起的焦虑。

"The Second was here a moment ago," said Ayanami, answering in Misato's stead. "Just before you woke up, she left, saying she was thirsty."  
“二号机刚才在这里，”Ayanami 代替 Misato 回答道，“就在你醒来之前，她说口渴就离开了。”

_But there's water right here,_ he almost replied. But then again, the rows of beer cans in the fridge back home had been forced to concede ground to an increasing number of bright red Coke cans ever since Asuka moved in. Sometimes he wondered how she stayed so skinny while drinking so much soda. He knew that she didn't have a gram of excess fat on her body, thanks to her plugsuit…  
但他几乎想反驳说，这里明明有水。不过转念一想，自从 Asuka 搬进来后，家里冰箱里那一排排啤酒罐不得不让位于越来越多的鲜红色可乐罐。有时他不禁好奇，她喝这么多汽水是怎么保持如此苗条的身材的。他知道她的身体没有一丝多余的脂肪，这多亏了她的插入栓服……

He forcibly cut off that train of thought, lowering his head slightly in shame. He really was just a shallow pervert. "So you're saying she's fine, Ayanami?"  
"他强行切断了那串思绪，略带羞愧地低下头。他真是个肤浅的变态。“所以你是说她没事，绫波？””

Without a word, Ayanami tilted her head an infinitesimal amount. Shinji started to feel anxious again at the sight, and her subsequent words intensified it. "I don't understand."  
"绫波一言不发，微微歪了歪头。看到这一幕，真嗣又开始感到焦虑，而她接下来的话更是加剧了这种情绪。“我不明白。””

"Uh, you don't understand?" He had no idea what was hard to understand about what he'd just asked. He admittedly wasn't in the best state of mind. Maybe he'd forgotten a word or something.  
“呃，你不明白？”他完全不知道自己刚才的问题有什么难以理解的。他承认自己当时心神不宁。也许是他忘了某个词之类的。

"In this case the definition of _fine_ leaves more to be desired. The Second Child I saw today was -"  
"在这种情况下，‘还好’的定义更让人难以满意。我今天见到的二号孩子——"

Misato interrupted, smiling awkwardly. "Oh, she's fine. She's still on edge because of what happened yesterday, that's all."  
美里打断道，尴尬地笑了笑。"哦，她没事。只是因为昨天的事情还有些紧张，仅此而已。"

"Oh," said Shinji, body sagging in relief. His head felt like it was melting into the pillow. Misato reaching out and doing something vaguely between ruffling his hair and pressing his head down didn't help.  
"哦，"真嗣松了口气，身体放松下来。他的头感觉像是要融化进枕头里。美里伸出手，既像是在揉乱他的头发，又像是在把他的头往下压，这让他感觉更糟了。

"That's the first thing you ask? How Asuka's doing? Not about your body? Oh, you sweet boy."  
"那是你第一个问题吗？问明日香怎么样？而不是关于你自己的身体？哦，你这个可爱的孩子。"

Shinji's heart swelled at that for a moment. He smiled shyly, but it soon froze on his face.  
那一刻，真嗣的心膨胀了起来。他羞涩地笑了，但很快笑容就凝固在他的脸上。

He was not a 'sweet boy' like she thought he was. All he ever did was search other people's faces both for the opportunity to be praised and for ways to avoid being hated. He was a coward and an opportunist, even now using this situation to get approval from Misato. He stopped smiling and closed his eyes, turning his head away. "No, Miss Misato, it's nothing like that."  
他并不是像她认为的那样是个“可爱的孩子”。他所做的只是寻找别人的脸，既为了得到表扬的机会，也为了避免被讨厌。他是个懦夫和机会主义者，甚至现在还利用这种情况从美里那里获得认可。他停止了微笑，闭上眼睛，转过头去。“不，美里小姐，不是那样的。”

Misato snorted. "And humble, heh."  
美里哼了一声。“还谦虚呢，哼。”

It was becoming almost painful. Shinji wanted to change the subject. He opened his eyes, only to be blinded by the sunlight shining directly into his face from the window. "How long have I been like this? What time is it now? What exactly happened to my body? Why isn't a doctor or nurse here yet?"  
这变得越来越痛苦了。真嗣想换个话题。他睁开眼睛，却被窗外直射进来的阳光刺得睁不开眼。“我这样多久了？现在几点了？我的身体到底怎么了？为什么医生或护士还没来？”

"It'll be nine o'clock soon, so it hasn't been a full day since the incident. A doctor has already come and gone, don't you remember?"  
“马上就九点了，所以从事故发生到现在还没满一天。医生已经来过又走了，你不记得了吗？”

"Really?" Shinji struggled to turn his head toward Ayanami, but she didn't say anything, so he looked back at his guardian. She took a small note out of her jacket pocket and opened it.  
"真的吗？" 真嗣努力将头转向绫波，但她没有说话，于是他又看向他的监护人。她从夹克口袋里拿出一张小纸条并打开。

"You woke up a total of four times between 5:45 and 7:00 this morning. The last time you woke up, a doctor was there. He did a brief examination, even talked with you, he said. You really don't remember anything?"  
"今天早上 5:45 到 7:00 之间，你总共醒来了四次。最后一次醒来时，有一位医生在场。他进行了简短的检查，甚至还和你交谈了，他说。你真的什么都不记得了吗？"

Shinji shook his head. 真嗣摇了摇头。

"Well, that's what they told me. Alright. Um… your organ functions have been restored, though they're still not completely back to their normal functionality. You know about LCL-reinforced treatment, right? Like what you received during the fight with the Fifth Angel? It was possible to fix you completely this time like they did back then, but they're afraid of possible side effects, so… How am I supposed to read this? Eh… Alanine… whatever, they want to test your blood and see how it goes. Until then, you'll be hospitalized here, on a liquid diet for the time being. You're expected to avoid strenuous physical activities even after discharge. Also no alcohol… eh, not like you're old enough to drink anyway…"  
"嗯，他们就是这么告诉我的。好吧。呃…你的器官功能已经恢复，但还没有完全回到正常状态。你知道 LCL 强化治疗吧？就像你在与第五使徒战斗时接受的那种？这次本可以像那时一样完全修复你，但他们担心可能的副作用，所以…我该怎么解读这个？呃…丙氨酸…管它呢，他们想检测你的血液看看情况。在那之前，你将在这里住院，暂时只能吃流食。出院后也要避免剧烈运动。还有，不能喝酒…呃，反正你也没到法定饮酒年龄…"

That was a bit of a ramble. She probably didn't sleep last night. The thought made Shinji's head almost hurt. Sharp ringing from Misato's phone didn't help either. The cell phone soon popped out of her pocket. Misato looked into the screen and frowned. "I have to go. I'll come back later today. If Asuka comes, please don't fight again, okay?"  
那番话有些语无伦次。她昨晚大概没睡。这个念头让真嗣的头几乎疼起来。美里手机尖锐的铃声也没起到什么帮助。手机很快从她口袋里弹了出来。美里盯着屏幕皱起了眉。“我得走了。今天晚些时候我会回来。如果明日香来了，请不要再吵架了，好吗？”

Something on Shinji's face must have seemed very funny, because Misato chuckled. "Just kidding. I'm pretty sure you don't have to worry about her."  
真嗣脸上的某种表情一定显得非常滑稽，因为美里轻声笑了起来。“开玩笑的。我相当确定你不必担心她。”

Shinji sighed softly. "Who can ever be sure about Asuka?"  
真嗣轻轻叹了口气。“谁能对明日香有把握呢？”

Misato shrugged her shoulders, putting her cell phone in her pocket. "She's easy to understand if you know where to look. She's more transparent than you think."  
美里耸了耸肩，把手机放进口袋。“如果你知道怎么看，她其实很容易懂。她比你想象的要直率得多。”

Shinji narrowed his eyes, turning his gaze to his feet. Asuka Langley Soryu, the Second Child. Shinji's newfound colleague, after Ayanami. The absurdly - no, _unimaginably_ wild and brazen girl who defied all of the expectations that Shinji had built over the course of his entire life. To this day, his face warmed whenever he thought about what happened in the debriefing session after their disastrous first sortie against 7th Angel. It was the first time in his life that he raised his voice in front of adults. He was annoyed beyond reason back then, and thought he could never fight alongside such an unpleasant girl, pretty face be damned. If Misato had said the same thing then, he would have wholeheartedly agreed, that she was so transparently awful and he couldn't stand her.  
真嗣眯起眼睛，目光转向脚尖。惣流·明日香·兰格雷，第二适格者。在绫波之后，真嗣新结识的同事。那个荒唐至极——不，难以想象的狂野而大胆的女孩，颠覆了真嗣一生中建立的所有预期。时至今日，每当他回想起与第七使徒那场灾难性的初次出击后的汇报会上发生的事，他的脸颊仍会发热。那是他一生中第一次在成年人面前提高嗓门。那时他气愤至极，认为永远无法与这样一个讨厌的女孩并肩作战，再漂亮也无济于事。如果当时美里说了同样的话，他会由衷地赞同，认为她糟糕得如此透明，自己无法忍受她。

But now… 但如今……

He thought about the face he had looked up at from the side, illuminated by the sunset. He thought about the smell of her shampoo, and the sight of faint wrinkles on her lips, and a tear, visible even in darkness, and the slender neckline that stretched down and down to…  
他回想起那张在夕阳余晖中仰望的脸庞，思绪飘向她洗发水的香气，唇边隐约的皱纹，即使在黑暗中也能看见的那滴泪，以及那纤细的颈线，一路向下延伸至……

"Is it really hard to believe?" Misato was giving him an almost disapproving look. "After what happened yesterday?"  
“真的那么难以置信吗？”美里几乎带着责备的眼神看着他，“经历了昨天的事之后？”

Shinji looked sideways at her, realizing with mortification that he'd gotten so distracted by thoughts of Asuka that he'd missed whatever it was she'd said before. "What?"  
真嗣侧目看向她，意识到自己因沉溺于对明日香的思绪而错过了她之前说的话，感到一阵尴尬。“什么？”

"She really is worried about you. Very much. Even if she pretends otherwise." Misato straightened her collar and headed to the door. "Well, I really have to go now. You did a great job yesterday, Shinji. Things would've gotten really ugly if it wasn't for you. Later in…"  
"她真的很担心你。非常担心。即使她假装不在乎。" 美里整理了一下衣领，朝门口走去。"好了，我现在真的得走了。你昨天做得很好，真嗣。如果不是你，情况会变得很糟糕。回头见……"

Before Misato's words were finished, the door opened with a swooshing sound to reveal Asuka. She was wearing a school uniform blouse and denim shorts, with a red can of Coke in one hand. She smiled brightly. "Leaving already?"  
美里的话还没说完，门就伴随着一阵呼啸声打开了，露出了明日香。她穿着校服衬衫和牛仔短裤，一手拿着一罐红色的可乐。她笑得灿烂。"要走了吗？"

"Well, I'm still busy. I don't think I can come back for lunch, either." Then Misato tilted her head slightly. From this angle Shinji couldn't see her face, but he was sure there was a smile on it. Her voice, full of mirth, confirmed Shinji's guess. "Took a long damn time to get one can of soda, eh? I thought you were emptying the whole vending machine or something. Did you really buy only one?"  
"嗯，我还有很多事要忙。我想我中午也回不来。" 然后美里微微侧头。从这个角度真嗣看不到她的脸，但他确信她脸上带着微笑。她充满欢乐的声音证实了真嗣的猜测。"买一罐饮料花了这么长时间，嗯？我还以为你要把整个自动贩卖机都清空了呢。你真的只买了一罐？"

Asuka frowned. "Why would I not?"  
明日香皱了皱眉。“我为什么不会？”

"So you didn't get one for me?"  
“所以你没给我带一份？”

"Why would I?" “我为什么要带？”

"Because you like me?" "因为你喜欢我？"

"Ha!" Asuka lifted her nose and turned her head to the side. Shinji knew they were (mostly) joking, but that didn't mean it wasn't a little uncomfortable whenever he had to watch this kind of thing from the side. He glanced at Ayanami. Her face was utterly expressionless. Misato, probably unaware of Shinji's discomfort, put her hands on her waist and straightened up. "Well, if that's the case, maybe as a rent, then?"  
"哈！" 明日香抬起鼻子，把头转向一边。真嗣知道他们多半是在开玩笑，但这并不意味着当他不得不在一旁观看这种情景时不会感到有点不自在。他瞥了一眼绫波。她的脸上毫无表情。美里可能没有察觉到真嗣的不适，双手叉腰站直了身子。"那么，如果是这样的话，或许可以当作房租？"

Asuka snorted. "What rent? You're forcing me to live with you. Am I supposed to pay you for that? Do you even know what a conscience is?"  
明日香哼了一声。"什么房租？你强迫我和你住在一起。我还要为此付钱给你吗？你知道良心是什么吗？"

"Oh, you silly girl, not that rent." Misato took a step and leaned toward Asuka, made a sniffing sound near her neck, and whispered something in her ear. Shinji couldn't hear what she was saying, but he could still see Asuka's face turn red.  
"哦，你这傻丫头，不是那个租金。" 美里向前一步，靠近明日香，在她脖颈旁嗅了嗅，然后在她耳边低语了几句。真嗣听不清她说什么，但他仍能看到明日香的脸颊泛红。

"Just. Shut up." "闭嘴就好。"

Misato giggled like a little girl, then put a hand on Asuka's shoulder as she passed by. Asuka twisted her shoulder out of Misato's grip, clearly annoyed. Misato, seemingly not caring about her reaction, passed the threshold and turned back, waving to Shinji with a smile on her face. Shinji bowed his head as a goodbye. Ayanami didn't utter a word as Misato vanished from sight and Asuka entered the room. Now only the three Children were left.  
美里咯咯笑得像个小女孩，然后经过明日香时，手搭在她肩上。明日香扭肩摆脱美里的手，显然有些恼火。美里似乎并不在意她的反应，跨过门槛，转身向真嗣微笑着挥手。真嗣低头致意告别。绫波零在美里消失不见、明日香进入房间后，一言未发。现在只剩下三位少年了。

Asuka stood at the entrance, frowned for a moment, then strode to the other side of Shinji's bed, across from Ayanami. She took a folding chair that was leaning against the window-side wall, snapped it open and sat with a thump. Bright blue eyes went back and forth between Shinji and Ayanami, narrowed, and turned toward the door.  
明日香站在入口处，皱了皱眉，然后大步走到真嗣床的另一边，与绫波相对。她从靠窗的墙边拿起一把折叠椅，啪地一声打开，重重坐下。明亮的蓝眼睛在真嗣和绫波之间来回扫视，眯起眼，转向门口。

Shinji recently realized that Asuka didn't like Ayanami, to say the least. He couldn't figure out why, but the animosity was undeniably there. After all, it was the part of human interactions that he was most sensitive to: hatred and resentment. He smiled awkwardly in an attempt to defuse the tension. "Hi, Asuka."  
真嗣最近意识到，至少可以说，明日香不喜欢绫波。他搞不清楚原因，但敌意确实存在。毕竟，这是他对人际关系中最敏感的部分：仇恨和怨恨。他尴尬地笑了笑，试图缓解紧张气氛。"嗨，明日香。"

Asuka didn't even look at Shinji. "What is _she_ doing here?"  
明日香甚至没有看真嗣一眼。"她在这里干什么？"

"Hello, Second." "你好，二号。"

There was a moment of silence. Shinji turned his heavy head to Ayanami. Something had passed through her calm eyes, something that would have been considered embarrassment in an ordinary person. She must have realized her answer was a bit off the mark. It was a subtle thing Shinji would never have noticed before. And it was something he had never seen from her. The mundane ridiculousness of it made Shinji laugh a little, his shoulders trembling. But he quickly stopped, feeling like his chest was pricked by a dozen needles.  
沉默片刻后，真嗣缓缓转过头看向绫波。她的平静眼眸中掠过一丝异样，若在常人身上或许会被视为尴尬。她想必是意识到自己的回答有些偏颇。这种细微的变化是真嗣从前未曾留意的，也是他从未在她身上见过的。这份平凡而荒谬的情感让真嗣不禁轻笑，肩膀微微颤抖。但他很快止住了笑声，感觉胸口仿佛被无数细针刺痛。

"What's so funny?" Asuka's voice was hard.  
"有什么好笑的？" 明日香的声音冷硬如冰。

Shinji cleared his throat and lay down on his back again. "Nothing."  
真嗣清了清喉咙，再次仰面躺下。“没什么。”

"What do you mean by -"  
“你说的-”

Ayanami's quiet yet firm voice cut through Asuka's words. "I came here because I heard from Captain Katsuragi that Ikari was wounded in the previous day's action and hospitalized, but regained consciousness this morning. Is that answer appropriate?"  
绫波平静而坚定的声音打断了明日香的话。“我来这里是因为听葛城司令说，真嗣在前一天的行动中受伤并住院，但今早已经恢复意识。这个回答合适吗？”

As soon as Shinji heard it he knew it was another mistake. Ayanami's question was genuine, but Asuka would surely take it as a provocation. He opened his mouth, trying to stop a possible fight - it was so weird that _he_ of all people was apparently the most perceptive one in the room - but Asuka reacted faster.  
一听到这话，真嗣立刻意识到这又是一个错误。绫波的问题是真诚的，但明日香肯定会将其视为挑衅。他张开嘴，试图阻止一场可能的争吵——最奇怪的是，他居然是房间里最敏锐的人——但明日香反应更快。

"Oh, really? So you didn't come here to jeer at me? You're not going to be all, _ooh, look at you, you volunteered so eagerly for this mission and then almost killed everyone involved! What a stupid girl! Why didn't you just shut up and let_ me _do it, because I would have done soooo much better!"_  
“哦，真的吗？所以你来这里不是为了嘲笑我？你不会说，哦，看看你，这么急切地自愿参加这次任务，结果差点害死所有人！真是个愚蠢的女孩！你为什么不闭嘴让我来做，因为我本可以做得好得多！”

Asuka's voice was much too loud and high-pitched. Shinji could feel a headache brewing and wished she would just stop. He almost wanted to ask why was she making this about herself when _he_ was the one in the hospital.  
明日香的声音太大且尖锐。真嗣感到一阵头痛正在酝酿，希望她能停下来。他几乎想问，为什么她要把这件事归咎于自己，而自己才是躺在医院的那个人。

Ayanami's brief reply was utterly toneless. "Is that true?"  
绫波的简短回答毫无声调。“真的吗？”

"What?" Asuka stretched her arm out to the side and put the unopened can on the window frame with a sharp clacking sound. "What are you talking about?"  
“什么？”明日香伸出手臂，将未开封的罐子猛地放在窗框上，发出清脆的咔嗒声。“你在说什么？”

"Is Ikari's injury your fault?"  
“碇的伤是你造成的吗？”

_Of course not,_ Shinji almost said, but he swallowed the words back at the sight of Asuka's brow furrowing. After a brief silence, Asuka opened her mouth.  
当然不是，真嗣几乎脱口而出，但看到明日香皱起的眉头，他又把话咽了回去。短暂的沉默后，明日香张开了嘴。

"That's ridiculous. It was all Misato and the engineering corp's fault."  
“那太荒谬了。这都是美里和工程部队的错。”

Shinji looked back and forth at both of them. Ayanami's lips parted very slightly and closed, and then opened again. "If that is true, I have no reason to fault you."  
真嗣来回看着他们两人。绫波的嘴唇微微张开又合上，然后再次张开。“如果那是真的，我没有理由责怪你。”

Asuka's eyes narrowed. It was clear that she was trying to determine if there was any hidden mockery in Ayanami's words. Shinji was under the impression that she was still harboring a grudge over that overpass. Although maybe he was just projecting. He had always been sensitive to the praise or condemnation hidden in the seemingly meaningless words of others, so he understood Asuka's reactions to Ayanami. What was really frustrating was the fact that he knew Ayanami never played such games, being in fact a very straightforward person. This was something Asuka either refused to acknowledge or was unaware of. But, as always, he didn't have the courage to step up in such a heated moment, so he just watched in silence. He didn't want Asuka, or Ayanami, or worse, both of them resenting him, something that would definitely happen if he dared to step in, considering his poor social skills.  
明日香的眼神变得锐利。显然，她在试图判断绫波的话中是否藏有嘲讽。真嗣觉得她还在为那次天桥上的事耿耿于怀。或许这只是他自己的投射。他一直对他人看似无意义的话语中隐藏的赞扬或指责异常敏感，因此他能理解明日香对绫波的反应。真正令人沮丧的是，他知道绫波从不玩这种把戏，她其实是个非常直率的人。这一点明日香要么拒绝承认，要么根本不知道。但一如既往，他没有勇气在这种紧张时刻站出来，只能默默旁观。他不想让明日香或绫波，甚至更糟，两人都怨恨他，考虑到他糟糕的社交技巧，如果他敢介入，这几乎是必然的结果。

Fortunately for him, Asuka didn't say anything, dropping the matter. Ayanami picked up a book that was lying on her lap (something Shinji hadn't noticed until now) and started to read it. On its cover were characters Shinji couldn't read properly. Asuka crossed her arms and gave the door an annoyed look.  
幸运的是，明日香什么也没说，就此作罢。绫波拿起放在膝上的一本书（真嗣直到现在才注意到）开始阅读。封面上的文字他看不太懂。明日香交叉双臂，不悦地瞪着门。

In the ensuing uncomfortable silence, he almost started to resent Misato. She definitely should have predicted this and not thrown him into such a situation. Thrown him to Asuka. He couldn't even begin to understand what was wrong with her. She opened fire again.  
在随之而来的尴尬沉默中，他几乎开始怨恨美里。她肯定应该预见到这种情况，而不是把他推入这样的境地。把他推向明日香。他甚至无法开始理解她哪里出了问题。她再次开火了。

"Why don't you go now, Wondergirl?"  
“你现在怎么不去，奇迹少女？”

While Shinji was taken aback by this unexpected development, Ayanami looked up from her book, her eyes cool. "Why?"  
尽管真嗣对这突如其来的发展感到意外，绫波却从她的书上抬起头，眼神冷静。“为什么？”

"When you visit a patient, you just check in and say hello and leave. You don't stick around for a long time. That's rather imposing, very impolite."  
“探望病人时，简单打个招呼就走，不宜久留。那样太打扰了，很不礼貌。”

Ayanami's eyes turned toward Shinji. He shook his head as best as he could for someone whose head was buried sideways in a fluffy pillow. "It's alright! You can stay as long as you want, Ayanami."  
绫波的目光转向了真嗣。尽管他的头深陷在柔软的枕头里，侧向一边，他还是尽力摇了摇头。“没关系！你可以待多久都行，绫波。”

She looked at Asuka again. Shinji's head also turned to that side. Asuka was grinning. "Oh, so shy and timid! He can't even express it when something's bugging him. But even you know what he's like, right? This is Shinji, you can't take his words at face value."  
她再次看向明日香。真嗣的头也转向了那边。明日香正咧嘴笑着。“哦，真是害羞又胆小！有事困扰他也说不出口。但即便如此，你也了解他的为人，对吧？这就是真嗣，不能只看表面理解他的话。”

"Asuka, please!" "明日香，求你了！"

Shinji heard the sharp clap of a book snapping shut. He tried to turn his head quickly. Too quickly - he felt dizzy and everything blurred again. He clenched his teeth and closed his eyes. When his vision came back, Ayanami was already standing at the door and looking back over her shoulder, her red eyes fixed on Asuka.  
真嗣听到书本啪的一声合上。他试图迅速转头，但转得太快了——他感到头晕目眩，一切再次变得模糊。他咬紧牙关，闭上了眼睛。当他的视线恢复时，绫波已经站在门口，回头望向明日香，红色的眼睛紧盯着她。

"I do not know about Ikari, but since I am sure you feel that way, I will leave for you. Goodbye, Ikari."  
"我不了解碇，但既然我确信你有这种感觉，我会为你离开。再见，碇。"

Only after the door closed behind her back did Shinji realize that the last word was directed at him. If his arms didn't feel like liquid, he would have torn his hair out with both hands. Ayanami might resent not only Asuka but him, too, for this.  
直到门在她身后关闭，真嗣才意识到那最后一句话是冲着他来的。如果不是他的手臂感觉像液体一样无力，他早就用双手扯着自己的头发了。绫波可能会因此不仅怨恨明日香，也怨恨他。

"What a little creep," Asuka muttered sourly.  
“真是个小怪胎，”明日香酸溜溜地嘀咕道。

Shinji was almost impressed by the brazenness of the remark. "Asuka, just, why did you do that?"  
真嗣几乎被这番厚颜无耻的话给震住了。“明日香，你为什么要这么做？”

"For this, obviously." "显然是为了这个。"

"Huh?" “啊？”

Asuka rose from her chair and pulled a new can of Coke out of her pocket. With such short and tight shorts, he wondered how she even fit the thing in her pocket at all.  
明日香从椅子上站起来，从口袋里掏出一罐新的可乐。她的短裤如此紧身，他不禁好奇她是怎么把这东西塞进口袋的。

He slowly raised his hand and took the offered can. It was slightly lukewarm to the touch, small droplets of condensation all over its surface. As he set it on his legs, not sure what to do with it since he couldn't exactly sit up right now, Asuka smiled slightly. "Oh, right."  
他缓缓举起手，接过递来的罐子。罐身微温，表面布满细小的水珠。他将它放在腿上，不确定该如何处理，因为他现在无法坐直，明日香微微一笑。“哦，对了。”

Asuka came to the bedside, squatted down, fiddled with something, then jumped back to her feet again. Shinji looked up at her with blank eyes. "What are you doing?"  
明日香走到床边，蹲下身，摆弄着什么，随即又跳了起来。真嗣抬头看着她，眼神茫然。“你在做什么？”

"It must be on the other side."  
“一定是在另一边。”

_What is on the other side,_ he almost asked, before she threw herself over Shinji's lap.  
他几乎要问，在另一边的是什么，她却已经扑到了真嗣的腿上。

It was as if his soul had left his body and he was looking down at the scene, utterly removed. Maybe his exhaustion finally got the better of him and he was hallucinating the whole thing. If he was, it was very vivid, a borderline assault on his senses. Asuka's torso, a finger's length above his thigh, moving back and forth and brushing against him. Pale skin cupped by bright red lace, visible through the gap left by the unbuttoned collar of her blouse. This close, he realized that he could see the entire undergarment through her white school shirt, red straps arcing over her shoulders and across her back. The bed creaked as the top half was levered into an upright position. And by the time she was done turning the crank, his torso wasn't the only thing that was fully erect. Shinji wanted to die on the spot. There was no way Asuka didn't know, since her body brushed against it every time she cranked the lever.  
仿佛他的灵魂已离体，正俯视着这一幕，完全置身事外。或许是疲惫终于战胜了他，让他产生了幻觉。如果真是如此，那幻觉也太过逼真，几乎是对感官的挑衅。明日香的上半身，仅一指之距悬于他大腿之上，来回移动并轻触着他。透过她衬衫未扣的领口，可见白皙肌肤被鲜红蕾丝包裹，而如此近距离下，他发现竟能透过她的白色校服衬衫，看到那红色肩带自肩头延伸至背部。随着床的上半部分被抬起，床板吱嘎作响。待她转动完手柄，挺立的不仅仅是他的上半身。真嗣恨不得当场消失。明日香不可能没察觉，毕竟每次她转动把手，身体都会触碰到那处。

He suspected Asuka was trying to embarrass him. That wasn't strange coming from her; she already did it once by shoving her bikini-clad chest in his face as she explained the concept of "thermal expansion". And by the clothes (or lack thereof - her shirts, while loose, didn't leave a lot to the imagination) she shamelessly wore around the house. She seemed to enjoy poking fun at him this way. Even now, when she was practically lying in his lap, she didn't pull away, but rather tucked her hair behind her ear with her right hand and looked sideways at Shinji with a small smile.  
他怀疑明日香是想让他难堪。这种事出自她并不奇怪；她之前就曾通过将穿着比基尼的上身凑到他面前，解释“热膨胀”的概念来捉弄他。还有她在家中毫不掩饰地穿着那些衣服（或者说缺乏衣物——她的衬衫虽然宽松，但并未给人太多遐想空间）。她似乎很喜欢这样逗弄他。即便此刻，她几乎躺在他腿上，也没有退开，而是用右手将头发撩到耳后，侧头对真嗣露出浅笑。

Even with his diminished senses, this close to her, he could smell something sweet. Perfume. Lavender, probably. It reminded Shinji that his whole body had been soaked in LCL twice (once during the operation, once during treatment) and hadn't been washed since. He probably smelled utterly disgusting. The thought made him flush and look away. At that, Asuka narrowed her eyes and sat back up.  
尽管感官减弱，如此靠近她，他仍能闻到一股甜香。香水，大概是薰衣草味。这让真嗣想起自己的全身已被 LCL 浸泡过两次（一次在操作中，一次在治疗时），且自那以后还未曾清洗过。他可能闻起来极其糟糕。这个念头让他脸红并移开视线。见状，明日香眯起眼睛，坐直了身子。

Silence reigned for a moment, then Asuka made a surprised noise.  
沉默笼罩片刻，随后明日香发出一声惊讶的声响。

"I almost forgot," she said. She pulled the narrow plastic tray table towards him and grabbed Shinji's hand that was holding the Coke can. She placed it on top of the table and opened the can. He trembled at the soft, fleeting pressure of her fingers on his. For a moment he thought this was the first time in his life that a girl had held his hand, then realized it had actually happened before with this very same girl, back there in Unit-02. It wasn't something totally insignificant, so it felt strange that he almost forgot the fact.  
"我差点忘了，"她说道。她将狭窄的塑料托盘桌拉向他，并抓住了真嗣手中拿着的可乐罐。她将它放在桌子上并打开了罐子。她的手指在他手上轻轻一触即离，让他不由得颤抖。有那么一刻，他以为这是他生命中第一次有女孩握住他的手，随即意识到这其实已经发生过，就在二号机里，和这个女孩。这并非微不足道的小事，所以几乎忘记这一事实让他感到奇怪。

"What are you doing? You're not going to drink it?" Asuka's voice cut through his reverie. She was still standing right next to him, too close for comfort, so he turned his eyes to the can. He could hear the sizzling sound peculiar to freshly opened soda. Could he even drink it, in this state, with nothing in his stomach? Suspicion flashed through his mind. This was the first time that Asuka was _this_ nice to him. Raising the bed for him, giving him a soda, giving him a…  
"你在干什么？不打算喝吗？"明日香的声音打断了他的沉思。她仍然站在他旁边，近得让人不安，于是他转头看向罐子。他能听到刚打开的汽水特有的嘶嘶声。在这种空腹状态下，他真的能喝吗？疑虑在他心中闪过。这是明日香第一次对他这么好。为他抬起床，给他可乐，给他……

Shinji gritted his teeth. Even if she was up to something, refusal was unthinkable. So he turned his head away from her, so that she couldn't smell his breath. "Thank you," he murmured.  
真嗣咬紧牙关。即使她别有用心，拒绝也是不可想象的。于是他转过头去，不让她闻到他的呼吸。"谢谢，"他低声说道。

He turned his head to the window-side again when he heard rustling. Asuka was sitting down in her chair, her can in hand. She opened it and took a sip. She continued to stare at Shinji. He carefully lifted his can with both hands and wet his lips first. It stung a little.  
他又转向窗边，听到一阵窸窣声。明日香坐在椅子上，手里拿着一罐饮料。她打开它，抿了一口。她继续盯着真嗣。他小心翼翼地用双手举起罐子，先润了润嘴唇。有点刺痛。

"Are you that angry because I kicked the First out?"  
“你这么生气是因为我把初号机踢出去了吗？”

Shinji's hands froze. "What?"  
真嗣的手僵住了。“什么？”

Asuka's eyes narrowed. "You heard me, so answer me. If you think what I'm saying is strange or wrong, just say so, don't do that _what?_ thing. You're not actually asking me anything. You're just saying you have a problem with my statement without giving a reason. That's called a rhetorical question. And I hate it."  
明日香的眼神变得锐利。“你听到了，那就回答我。如果你觉得我说的奇怪或不对，直接说出来，别搞那种什么？把戏。你其实没在问我问题。你只是说你对我的话有意见，却不给理由。那叫反问句。我讨厌这种。”

"I, I'm sorry." It almost made Shinji angry. She didn't need to be so aggressive over this small thing. Not like he did something too out of the norm. But he feared arguing with her, figuring it would be just better to apologize and avoid a confrontation.  
“我，我很抱歉。”这让真嗣几乎感到愤怒。她没必要为这点小事如此咄咄逼人。他也没做什么出格的事。但他害怕与她争论，觉得还是道歉避免冲突更好。

Asuka crossed her arms, clearly not satisfied with his apology, then shook her head after a while. "So, are you?"  
明日香交叉双臂，显然对他的道歉并不满意，过了一会儿摇了摇头。“那么，你是吗？”

To buy some time, Shinji brought the can to his mouth. He had no desire to be involved in their - no, in _Asuka's_ unilateral loathing of Ayanami. He didn't want to either support or oppose it. He had no interest in participating. That aside, for some reason he didn't feel like blaming Asuka for the earlier confrontation anyway.  
为了争取时间，真嗣将罐子举到嘴边。他并不想卷入他们——不，是明日香对绫波单方面的厌恶之中。他既不想支持也不想反对。他对此毫无兴趣。除此之外，不知为何，他也不觉得自己有必要为之前的冲突责怪明日香。

Was that the right thing to do? He was engulfed by sudden doubt. Asuka was clearly in the wrong. Why was he feeling this way?  
这样做对吗？他突然被疑虑吞没。明日香显然是错的。为什么他会这样想？

Shinji shook his head, pushing his guilt away. "No, I'm not."  
真嗣摇了摇头，把内疚感抛开。"不，我不是。"

Asuka snorted. "Of course."  
明日香哼了一声。“当然。”

_What the hell do you mean by '_of course?' he didn't ask, electing to just look ahead and sip his Coke. The clock near the door read nine o'clock. If it was a school day, the class rep would…  
他没问“当然”是什么意思，只是向前看，啜了一口可乐。门边的时钟显示九点。如果是上学日，班长会……

"I wouldn't have kicked her out if it weren't for Hikari, you know."  
“如果不是因为光，我不会把她赶出去的，你知道的。”

Shinji looked back at Asuka and blinked in surprise. It was like she read his mind. Then suspicion arose over what exactly her words even meant. What did kicking Ayanami out have to do with the Class Rep? If she really meant what he thought she meant, then it was probably some of the biggest nonsense he'd heard in recent memory. "Why?"  
真嗣回头看向明日香，惊讶地眨了眨眼。她仿佛读懂了他的心思。随后，疑虑涌上心头，她的那些话究竟是什么意思？把绫波赶出去和班长有什么关系？如果她真的如他所想的那样，那这可能是他近期听过的最荒谬的话了。“为什么？”

Asuka shrugged. "Hikari told me that buying something for someone in front of everyone else while not buying them anything is impolite. No matter how close you are to someone, you shouldn't make the rest feel left out, she said. You Japanese and your Japanese rules, ugh."  
明日香耸了耸肩。“光告诉我，在大家面前给某人买东西而其他人什么都没有，这是不礼貌的。无论你和某人关系多好，都不应该让其他人感到被冷落，她是这么说的。你们日本人，还有这些日本规矩，真是的。”

He doubted such gift-giving etiquette was limited only to Japan, but he nodded anyway and brought the can to his mouth. Not like he had any experience with foreign countries and cultures; he had no chance of winning that argument against Asuka. But even considering that, Asuka didn't sound too logical. Kicking out Ayanami like that was infinitely ruder than just giving him a drink and ignoring her. He knew Asuka was smart, but sometimes she was so unreasonable to the point of utter incomprehensibility. He couldn't even begin to follow her thought process. _Dealing with her is really hard,_ he thought, tilting the can to his mouth.  
他怀疑这种送礼的礼节并不只限于日本，但还是点了点头，将罐子举到嘴边。毕竟他对国外的国家和文化毫无经验，与明日香争论无疑是自讨苦吃。但即便如此，明日香的说法也并不十分合乎逻辑。像那样把绫波赶走，远比直接给他喝饮料然后无视她要粗鲁得多。他知道明日香聪明，但有时她的无理取闹到了令人费解的地步。他甚至无法理解她的思维逻辑。应付她真是太难了，他想，将罐子倾斜到嘴边。

"Oh, yeah, that reminded me. Did you know Hikari was going to buy you a present?"  
“哦，对了，这让我想起来了。你知道光子打算给你买礼物吗？”

Shinji's hands froze again, stopping the can. At this rate, it was going to go flat before he finished it. "What present?"  
真嗣的手再次僵住，罐子停在了半空。照这样下去，罐子里的饮料在他喝完之前就会变得没气了。“什么礼物？”

"I don't know. Just some Okinawan souvenirs they sell. It's not fair for her to buy stuff only for me, so she was considering buying something for all the pilots. I told her not to. I told her it'd just make you feel pressured and stressed. I was right, hmm?"  
"我不知道。就是他们卖的冲绳纪念品。她只给我买东西不公平，所以她在考虑给所有飞行员买些东西。我告诉她不要这么做。我说那只会让你感到压力和紧张。我说对了吧，嗯？"

Shinji sighed, nodding. The idea of getting something from a girl was too much, he thought, sipping the Coke again.  
真嗣叹了口气，点点头。他认为从一个女孩那里得到东西的想法太过沉重，于是又喝了一口可乐。

"I don't know Horaki very well. It'd only be a burden to receive such a thing from her."  
"我对洞木不太了解。从她那里收到这样的东西只会成为负担。"

Asuka leaned against the back of the chair and smiled wryly. "It's really hard to understand, you know."  
明日香靠在椅背上，苦笑道：“真的很难理解，你知道的。”

"I don't think I have the ability to get along with everyone so quickly like you, Asuka."  
“我觉得我没有能力像你那样迅速和大家打成一片，明日香。”

"Oh sure, but I wasn't talking about that."  
“哦，当然，但我说的不是那个。”

"Then?" "然后呢？"

"Horaki, you just called her. And Miss Misato, Ayanami, and so on and on. This _san,_ this _kun,_ last names, do you people have a law against using first names or something? You've known each other for months now."  
"洞木，你刚刚叫她姓。还有美里小姐，绫波，等等等等。这个 san，这个 kun，全是姓氏，你们是不是有什么规定不准用名字啊？你们都认识几个月了。"

With a wry smile, Shinji shook his head. "It's a big deal here in Japan. Using the first name is a sign of closeness, and it could become really weird if you're not a hundred percent sure about where you stand with someone else. It has to be mutual and concrete."  
带着一丝苦笑，真嗣摇了摇头。"在日本，这可是件大事。用名字表示关系亲近，如果你不确定和对方的关系，用名字会显得很奇怪。这必须是双方都明确且一致的。"

"Ah, Japan, the maze of hypocrisy and pretense. I'm already sick of it." 
"啊，日本，这虚伪与矫饰的迷宫。我已经厌倦了。"

The words were harsh, but she wore a gentle smile. It was completely different from the sharp, confident, sometimes even contemptuous smile he usually saw on her, and Shinji was completely mesmerized by the sight. There was something warm in her expression, like the morning sun currently pouring from the window, and he could not take his eyes off it. It was that warmth in her voice that brought Shinji to his senses, breaking the spell.
话语虽尖锐，但她却带着温柔的微笑。这与他通常在她脸上看到的锐利、自信，有时甚至轻蔑的笑容截然不同，真嗣完全被这一幕迷住了。她的表情中透着一种温暖，如同此刻从窗户倾泻而入的晨光，让他无法移开视线。正是她声音中的那份温暖，让真嗣回过神来，打破了魔咒。

"What are you looking at?"
"你在看什么？"

Only then did Shinji realize that he was staring at her. He turned his reddened face away and quickly lifted the can. He swallowed too much too fast, and lukewarm sugar water surged down the wrong pipe. Brown droplets splattered all over the front of his white patient gown and the thin sheet as he spluttered and coughed. Shinji put the can down on the table, closed his eyes tightly and held his chest. He heard the rasping sound of tissues pulled out from their box, too many for his liking, a testament to Asuka's wastefulness. When he opened his eyes with a sigh, Asuka was holding out a large wad of tissues. Shinji took them, put all but one on the table, and wiped his mouth with it.
直到那时，真嗣才意识到自己一直在盯着她。他转过脸去，脸颊泛红，迅速举起罐子。他喝得太急太多，温热的糖水猛地冲进了气管。棕色的水滴溅满了他的白色病人服和薄薄的床单，他一边咳嗽一边喷了出来。真嗣把罐子放在桌上，紧闭双眼，捂住胸口。他听到纸巾从盒子里抽出的沙沙声，太多了，他不喜欢，这证明了明日香的大手大脚。当他叹了口气睁开眼时，明日香正拿着一大叠纸巾递给他。真嗣接过纸巾，留下一张在桌上，用它擦了擦嘴。

"Sometimes I think you do it on purpose. To make me call you an idiot."
“有时候我觉得你是故意的。为了让我叫你白痴。”

There wasn't a thorn in her voice, though. Without replying, Shinji kept wiping his mouth and his clothes.
不过，她的语气里并没有刺。真嗣没有回答，继续擦着嘴和衣服。

After that a silence fell. Asuka sat in her chair, legs crossed, looking at her cell phone. Shinji sat awkwardly, sipping the flat Coke. Maybe he should ask Misato to bring some entertainment from home if he were to stay here longer. Or at least bring his things from the locker, including the SDAT he put there before the sortie. Come to think of it, the latter was much more attractive. If he asked for something else, like books, Misato would remember his exam score, he was sure.
随后是一阵沉默。明日香坐在椅子上，双腿交叉，盯着她的手机。真嗣尴尬地坐着，啜饮着已经没气的可乐。如果他要在这里待得更久，也许应该请美里从家里带些娱乐用品来。或者至少把他储物柜里的东西带来，包括出击前放在那里的 SDAT。想想看，后者更有吸引力。如果他要求其他东西，比如书，美里肯定会想起他的考试成绩，他确信。

Asuka opened her mouth the moment Shinji turned his eyes to her, wondering what she was doing with her cell phone. Her eyes, shadowed by the sunlight coming through the window behind her, remained on the screen.
真嗣刚把目光转向她，想知道她在用手机做什么，明日香就张开了嘴。她的眼睛被身后窗户透进的阳光遮住，仍然盯着屏幕。

"Hey, I have something to ask you, Shinji."
“嘿，真嗣，我有件事要问你。”

He felt uneasy at her unusually subdued voice. She might be up to something, but it was equally possible that he was overreacting. He had never been good at reading the subtext behind others' gestures and words.
听到她异常低沉的声音，他感到不安。她可能又在打什么主意，但也可能是他反应过度了。他向来不擅长解读他人言行背后的隐含意义。

"What you did yesterday."
“你昨天做的事。”

Shinji swallowed nervously. The slight vibration from the air conditioner, which he had not heard until this moment, tickled his ears. "Uh, yeah?"
真嗣紧张地咽了咽口水。空调那细微的震动，直到此刻才引起他的注意，轻轻搔弄着他的耳朵。“呃，是吗？”

"Would you do it again? Even if you knew the same thing would happen?"
"你还会再做一次吗？即使你知道同样的事情会发生？"

Shinji blinked, unable to understand the question. "What do you mean?"
真嗣眨了眨眼，无法理解这个问题。“你是什么意思？”

Asuka continued calmly, still staring at the screen of her phone. "I mean, if you went back to that moment, by time travel or something like that, would you do the same thing again, knowing you would suffer and end up hospitalized here?"
明日香继续平静地说，仍然盯着她的手机屏幕。“我是说，如果你回到那个时刻，通过时间旅行或其他类似的方式，明知你会受苦并最终住进医院，你还会做同样的事情吗？”

"Oh." It was simpler than he thought. Why was she even asking this question? With something close to confidence, he opened his mouth. "Of course, Asuka."
"哦。" 这比他想象的要简单。她为什么要问这个问题呢？带着近乎自信的心情，他张开了嘴。"当然，明日香。"

Asuka's eyes darted up from the phone to his face and then returned to the screen. "Well, what if things changed? What if something worse happened to you because you jumped in there? Would you still do it?"
明日香的目光从手机上移开，迅速扫过他的脸，然后又回到了屏幕上。"那么，如果情况变了怎么办？如果你因为跳进去而遭遇更糟糕的事情，你还会这么做吗？"

Shinji looked down at the can in his hands, then looked at all the brown spots on the sheet, one by one. He was afraid of death. Honestly, he didn't have the confidence to say that he would do it again if he knew for sure that he would die. Admitting it would paint him as a coward in her eyes. But he had already done it once, hurling himself over the edge with the exact same expectations. So he nodded, convinced that he wasn't lying for his pride. "Yeah."
真嗣低头看着手中的罐子，然后逐一注视着床单上的所有棕色斑点。他害怕死亡。老实说，他没有信心说自己如果确信会死还会再次这么做。承认这一点会让她觉得自己是个懦夫。但他已经做过一次了，带着完全相同的预期跳下边缘。所以他点了点头，确信自己不是为了自尊而撒谎。"嗯。"

"Well, what if it wasn't me down there? What if it was the First or Misato?"
"那么，如果下面的人不是我呢？如果是初号机或者美里小姐呢？"

Shinji's lips parted slightly without him realizing. Asuka was watching him intently, her phone forgotten. She was sizing him up, calculating and analyzing his every move. The distant sound of the PA filtered in from the corridor. Mr. Hideki from Internal Medicine, please report to the reception department immediately. Mr. Hideki from Internal Medicine, please report to the reception department immediately. He couldn't understand why she was so serious about such a meaningless question.
真嗣的嘴唇微微张开，自己却未曾察觉。明日香正目不转睛地盯着他，手机已被遗忘。她在仔细打量他，计算并分析着他的一举一动。走廊里传来远处广播的声音。内科的秀树先生，请立即前往接待处。内科的秀树先生，请立即前往接待处。他不明白她为何对这样一个无意义的问题如此认真。

Shinji nodded. "Yeah, I'd do it again. For you, or for anyone else down there."
真嗣点头。“嗯，我会再做一次。为了你，或者为了下面任何一个人。”

There was a brief silence. Then Asuka's lips curled up slightly to form a smile. Shinji smiled back, the weird weight that had been pressing on his chest lifting away. Asuka's smile grew bigger in response, which made his own bigger, too. Shinji scratched the back of his head, feeling quite good.
短暂的沉默后，明日香的嘴角微微上扬，露出了微笑。真嗣回以微笑，那股压在胸口的怪异沉重感随之消散。明日香的笑容愈发灿烂，真嗣的笑容也跟着扩大。他挠了挠后脑勺，感觉相当不错。

Asuka folded her cell phone with a snap and stood up, picking up her empty can from the window frame. "I'm leaving."
明日香啪的一声合上手机，站起身来，从窗框上拿起空罐子。“我要走了。”

Shinji's usually quiet sixth sense suddenly screamed at him as she strode toward the door without waiting for his answer. He felt anxiety tighten urgently around his chest.
平日里沉默寡言的真嗣突然感到第六感尖锐地向他示警，她大步走向门口，没有等他的回应。他感到焦虑急切地紧缩在胸口。

"Asuka," he blurted. "明日香," 他脱口而出。

Asuka stopped at the door, turning her head back towards him. Shinji forced saliva down his drying throat and opened his mouth. "Thank you. For coming today."
明日香在门口停下，回头望向他。真嗣强咽下干涩的喉咙，张开了嘴。"谢谢你。今天能来。"

Asuka grinned. "Yeah." 明日香咧嘴一笑。"嗯。"

Less than an hour after she left, a doctor and a nurse with a clipboard visited his room. The doctor was not amused by the half-empty Coke can. Don't touch soft drinks until further notice, he sternly warned.
她离开不到一小时，一位医生和一位拿着夹板的护士就来到了他的病房。医生对那半空的可乐罐并不感到好笑。他严厉警告道：‘在进一步通知之前，不要碰软饮料。’

It was only after the doctor inquired as to how he was feeling that Shinji realized Asuka had never asked him if he was okay, or if he was feeling sick.
直到医生询问他的感觉如何，真嗣才意识到明日香从未问过他是否还好，或者是否感到不适。

Even after he finished the hospital lunch, even after a totally exhausted Misato dropped off the contents of his locker that afternoon, even after he finally plugged his ears with the SDAT, the thought that she didn't ask about him still lingered.
即使他吃完了医院的午餐，即使那天下午筋疲力尽的美里送来了他储物柜里的东西，即使他最终用 SDAT 塞住了耳朵，她没有询问他的念头依然挥之不去。

### Chapter 4 Substitutes

"This is the impenetrable wall of Jericho!"  
“这就是那坚不可摧的耶利哥之墙！”

The boy nodded with that stupid look of his. His gaze lingered for a moment on a certain place and then quickly dropped as if nothing had happened. But she saw it all, feeling a certain sense of pride. _Of course you can't help but gawk at them._  
男孩点了点头，带着他那愚蠢的表情。他的目光在某处停留了一会儿，然后迅速移开，仿佛什么都没发生。但她全看在眼里，感到一种自豪。当然，你忍不住会盯着他们看。

"Breaching this wall would result in the death penalty! Go to sleep like the child you are!"  
“越过这道墙将处以死刑！像个孩子一样去睡觉吧！”

After that, Asuka waited. In the dark, gazing intently at the sliding door that wasn't opening.  
之后，明日香等待着。在黑暗中，凝视着那扇不会打开的滑动门。

Not like she was expecting too much. She'd already given him a green light. It might have been too subtle, she was aware of that, but for her it was the most she could do. She was even somewhat proud of her word choice, especially because it was impromptu, a spur of the moment thing. _A high and mighty wall, but maybe you should have a little faith and try to breach it. Who knows, maybe you'll be rewarded with a miracle._  
并非她期待过高。她已经给了他绿灯。可能太过隐晦，她心里有数，但对她来说，这已是极限。她甚至对自己的措辞有些自豪，尤其是那是在一时冲动下脱口而出的。一座高高在上的墙，但或许你该有点信心，试着去突破它。谁知道呢，也许你会因此得到一个奇迹。

And it wasn't even too important if that idiot understood her reference or not. If they got horny enough, men turned into beasts that would pull down their pants and hump a woman like a dog while their daughters were visiting their hospitalized wives in the next room. Even Mr. Kaji wasn't totally free from such degeneracy, or he wouldn't have fallen for a woman like Misato. A little bit disappointing, but that was life. And that meant the boy would be completely unable to restrain himself even if he wanted to, now that Misato wasn't home and they were alone in the house. He definitely would try something.  
而且，那傻瓜是否理解她的暗示并不重要。如果他们欲望足够强烈，男人会变成野兽，在女儿探望隔壁病房妻子时，像狗一样对女人脱裤猛扑。即便是加治先生也未能完全摆脱这种堕落，否则他不会被美里这样的女人吸引。虽有些失望，但这就是生活。这意味着，即使他想克制，现在美里不在家，他们独处一室，他也完全无法自控。他肯定会试图做些什么。

Unless, of course, he wasn't interested in her.  
当然，除非他对她没兴趣。

After an incomprehensible amount of time passed, Asuka sat on the floor. She wondered if he was really, truly uninterested in her. Her excited heart cooled down quickly, but then caught fire again. What did she expect in the first place? Why did she care anyway? That pathetic little boy, nowhere near a worthy substitute for Mr. Kaji…  
经过一段难以理解的时间后，明日香坐在地板上。她想知道他是否真的、真的对她不感兴趣。她激动的心迅速冷却，但随即又重新燃起。她最初期望的是什么？无论如何，她为什么要在意呢？那个可怜的小男孩，远不及加持先生的一半……

Asuka froze at the sound of footsteps coming from the other side of the door.  
听到门外传来的脚步声，明日香僵住了。

She probably made too much noise in her rush to her futon, but she didn't have a choice. Anything was better than getting caught waiting at the door. And she almost wasn't fast enough. As soon as she covered herself with the blanket, the door opened with a creak. Asuka, suppressing her racing heart, raised her upper body and made a show of surprise. She frowned at the dark shadow standing at the door. Her elbows throbbed, having hit the futon too quickly.  
她可能在匆忙跑向被褥时弄出了太多噪音，但她别无选择。任何事情都比在门口被抓到要好。而且她几乎不够快。她一用毯子盖住自己，门就吱嘎一声开了。明日香压抑着狂跳的心，抬起上半身，装出一副惊讶的样子。她皱着眉头看着站在门口的黑暗身影。她的肘部因撞击被褥过快而隐隐作痛。

"What the hell? You really want to-"  
"搞什么鬼？你真的想——"

The boy approached with a blank face, not even waiting for her to finish. As she looked up with her lips slightly parted, paralyzed half by shock and half by excitement, his mouth came down and roughly shut hers. She tried to put up at least a token resistance, but he grasped both of her wrists with one hand and lifted them above her head to pin them against the futon. His grip was stronger than she expected - she wasn't able to break it, and that only furthered her excitement. _Be gentle, what should I tell Misato if they get bruised,_ she thought. A moan shamefully escaped from her lips, and the boy didn't miss the chance, thrusting his tongue in. Asuka's body wriggled for a moment like a freshly caught fish, and then relaxed into the futon. She closed her eyes, melting beneath the relentless pressure of his mouth and his body on top of hers.  
男孩面无表情地走近，甚至不等她说完。当她抬头，嘴唇微张，一半震惊一半兴奋地僵住时，他的嘴猛地压了下来，粗暴地封住了她的唇。她试图至少象征性地抵抗一下，但他用一只手抓住她的两只手腕，将它们举过头顶，按在床垫上。他的握力比她预想的要强——她无法挣脱，这反而加剧了她的兴奋。温柔点，要是弄伤了怎么跟美里交代，她想着。一声羞耻的呻吟不由自主地从她唇间逸出，男孩没有错过机会，舌头猛地探入。明日香的身体像刚捕获的鱼一样扭动了一会儿，然后放松地躺在了床垫上。她闭上眼睛，在他的唇和身体的无情压迫下融化。

_How is he so good?_ It was all Asuka could think. A hand was snaking under her yellow t-shirt - Misato's yellow t-shirt - but she didn't even think about stopping it. _Does he have any experience?_ That was impossible. As soon as the thought crossed her mind, his mouth left hers with a wet noise. He also let go of her wrists. Panting heavily, Asuka brought her cramped hands down to her chest and opened her eyes. Her heart stopped at the sight above her.  
他怎么这么厉害？这是明日香唯一能想到的。一只手正悄悄探入她的黄色 T 恤——美里小姐的黄色 T 恤——但她丝毫没有阻止的念头。他有过经验吗？这不可能。这个念头刚闪过，他的嘴唇就离开了她的，发出一声湿润的声响。他也放开了她的手腕。明日香喘着粗气，将僵硬的手放回胸前，睁开了眼睛。看到上方的景象，她的心跳几乎停止了。

"Of course I'm good, Asuka. I'm an adult, unlike Shinji. I've done this countless times with Misato."  
“当然我厉害了，明日香。我是个成年人，不像真嗣。我和美里已经做过无数次了。”

Mr. Kaji was looking down at her with his roguish smile. All of the warmth left Asuka's body. Her underwear was suddenly clammy, her enthusiasm evaporating. She lay there, stiff and motionless, as he leaned down again, the strong smell of his cologne assaulting her senses. "Misato also did some nice tricks with her tongue."  
加持先生正低头看着她，带着他那不羁的笑容。所有的温暖从明日香的身体中消失。她的内裤突然变得潮湿，热情也随之消散。她僵硬地躺在那里，一动不动，而他再次俯身下来，浓烈的古龙水味刺激着她的感官。“美里还会用舌头玩些花样呢。”

Anger flashed through her at being compared to that old hag. Asuka closed her eyes and turned her head away.  
被比作那个老巫婆，她心中怒火中烧。明日香闭上眼睛，转过头去。

Stubble pricked her chin. "No, don't," she gasped.  
胡茬刺痛了她的下巴。“不，不要，”她喘息道。

"That's strange. Isn't this what you wanted?"  
“真奇怪。这不是你想要的吗？”

With a gasp, Asuka opened her eyes again. Yeah, she heard it right. Where Mr. Kaji was a moment ago, Shinji Ikari was now, his face inches from hers, looking down at her with resentment stark in his puppy dog eyes.  
伴随着一声惊呼，明日香再次睁开了眼睛。没错，她听得清清楚楚。就在刚才加持先生所在的地方，现在变成了碇真嗣，他的脸离她只有几英寸，低头看着她，那双狗狗眼里的怨恨清晰可见。

"You didn't really want me. You were fine with anyone."  
“你其实并不想要我。你对任何人都可以。”

"If you're going to dream anyway, why not dream higher? Have something that you originally wanted?"  
“既然无论如何都要做梦，为什么不梦得更远大些？拥有你最初想要的东西？”

Once again, that deep voice. Doubt overwhelmed Asuka, paralyzing her. Unable to move, she closed her eyes tightly. Once again, something sharp pricked her chin.  
那深沉的声音再次响起。疑虑如潮水般淹没了明日香，使她动弹不得。无法移动，她紧紧闭上了眼睛。又一次，有什么尖锐的东西刺痛了她的下巴。

"Wark!" “Wark！”

Asuka opened her eyes, horrified. The fishy smell hit her first, followed by a penguin head that filled her world. The beast looked down at her with a tilted head for a moment, then pecked her chin once again. The last dregs of sleep drained away at the sharp sting. Asuka sat up and roughly pushed away the bird, annoyed.  
明日香惊恐地睁开眼睛。首先袭来的是一股鱼腥味，紧接着一只企鹅的头占据了她的视野。那野兽歪着头看了她一会儿，然后再次啄了啄她的下巴。尖锐的刺痛感让最后一丝睡意消散无踪。明日香坐起身，粗鲁地推开那只鸟，感到一阵恼火。

The house was still bright. She turned her head to check the clock. It was 3:30 in the afternoon. It seemed her little nap in the living room after an instant ramen lunch lasted a bit longer than she planned. Her whole body was wet, including her panties. With an annoyed scoff, she picked up the cell phone that was lying next to her and headed to her room. The penguin stalked at her heels, but she didn't pay any mind to it.  
屋内依旧明亮。她转头查看时钟。已经是下午 3 点 30 分了。看来她在速食拉面午餐后在客厅的小憩比计划的要长一些。她的全身都湿透了，包括内裤。她不悦地哼了一声，捡起旁边躺着的手机，朝自己的房间走去。那只企鹅紧随其后，但她并未在意。

She checked her phone while pushing open her door. There were several text messages.  
她一边推开房门，一边查看手机。收到了好几条短信。

_How's it going Asuka? We just arrived in Japan. It was so fun but now that I'm back in town I'm too tired. I was wondering if we could meet tomorrow, but turns out it's impossible on my end! See you at school on Monday! Say hello to Ikari for me too!  
明日香，最近怎么样？我们刚到日本。旅途很有趣，但现在回到城里我累坏了。我在想我们明天能不能见面，结果发现我这边实在抽不出时间！周一学校见！也替我向碇问好！_

_Oh, yeah, today is Saturday,_ she thought, not particularly interested. Next message.  
哦，对了，今天是周六，她心想，并没有特别在意。下一条信息。

_Of course I remember. My schedule this evening is a little flexible for now, nothing's concrete yet. I'll text you later, hopefully not too late.  
当然记得。今晚我的日程目前还有些弹性，还没完全定下来。我稍后给你发消息，希望不会太晚。_

A possibility of dinner with Mr. Kaji. That should lift her heart up, but this time it didn't for some reason. Probably because of the dream. Well, what kind of dream was that anyway?  
与加治先生共进晚餐的可能性。这本应让她心情好转，但这次不知为何没有。大概是因为那个梦吧。话说回来，那到底是个什么样的梦呢？

Asuka opened the drawer, frowning. She pushed away the clingy penguin (she had no idea what the hell was wrong with that animal) with her foot while holding the cell phone with one hand and rummaging through the drawer with the other. Then she realized her favorite bra was still heaped in the corner of the room after being roughly thrown there two days ago. Asuka walked towards it, picked it up, and sniffed. It didn't smell that bad. Not like she wore it for more than a few hours anyway. The subtle scent of lavender still clung to it, reminding her of a humiliating memory.  
明日香打开抽屉，皱起眉头。她用脚把那只黏人的企鹅（她完全不知道那动物到底出了什么问题）推开，一手拿着手机，另一手在抽屉里翻找。然后她意识到她最喜欢的胸罩两天前被粗暴地扔在房间角落，还堆在那里。明日香走过去，捡起来，闻了闻。味道没那么糟糕。毕竟她也没穿超过几个小时。淡淡的薰衣草香依然附着其上，让她想起了一段羞辱的记忆。

"I must have been crazy," Asuka muttered sourly, putting down the bra. That thing was useless anyway. She found the results to prove it. Twice.  
“我一定是疯了。”明日香酸溜溜地嘀咕着，放下胸罩。那东西反正也没用。她找到的结果已经证明了这一点。两次。

She got up again, picked up the first things her hand found in the drawer, and checked the next text.  
她再次起身，随手从抽屉里抓起第一件物品，然后查看下一条信息。

_Asuka, I don't know what happened between you two, but can't you please reconsider? He's been having bouts of pain since the day before yesterday. This morning, I was there for under an hour and saw it three times. Like a seizure, it comes and goes. They got nothing from tests, say it's most likely a phantom pain. They give him painkillers, but they're so strong, he sleeps throughout the day now. I don't think it's right. You're a veteran pilot, so I know all this probably sounds so silly and beneath you, you're free of all these things I know, but please remember Shinji is new to this. Can you  
明日香，我不知道你们俩之间发生了什么，但你能再考虑一下吗？从前天开始，他就一直在疼痛发作。今天早上，我在那里不到一个小时就看到三次。像癫痫一样，来去匆匆。检查什么都没发现，说是很可能是幻痛。他们给他止痛药，但药效太强，他现在整天都在睡觉。我觉得这样不对。你是资深驾驶员，我知道这些对你来说可能听起来很愚蠢，微不足道，我明白你已经超越了这些，但请记住，真嗣是新手。你能..._

One more message followed, probably because Misato hit the character limit. So very eager. Asuka's mouth twitched. _come and help him? I'll buy you dinner. How about that? Something good. To make up for the canceled trip._  
又一条消息紧随其后，大概是因为美里触发了字数限制。真是急切。明日香的嘴角微微抽动。来帮忙照顾他？我请你吃饭。怎么样？吃点好的。算是弥补取消的旅行。

Unlike the two previous messages, this one genuinely annoyed her. _Just because I don't whine and cry like a kid doesn't mean I'm totally fine,_ she thought. She herself had an episode once at dinner last night. She'd had to sit still for almost a minute, not touching her dish. Misato was busy staring at her phone throughout it and didn't seem to notice.  
与前两条消息不同，这一条确实让她感到恼火。仅仅因为我没有像孩子一样抱怨和哭泣，并不意味着我完全没事，她想。昨晚晚餐时她自己也有过一次情绪波动。她不得不静坐近一分钟，没有碰她的盘子。美里整个过程中都在忙着盯着手机，似乎没有注意到。

_I'm busy. Studying. Someone's been pestering me about grades. If you need an unpaid caregiver or something why don't you ask the First? I heard she's a professional at getting her bones broken and things like that. I'm sure she could help him.  
我很忙。在学习。有人一直在烦我关于成绩的事。如果你需要一个免费的看护人或其他什么，为什么不问问第一适格者？我听说她在骨折之类的事情上很专业。我相信她能帮上忙。_

Asuka stomped her way to the bathroom. Penpen, quite persistent this afternoon, tried to follow her in, so she pushed him out with her foot. After closing the accordion door she took off her damp and clingy panties and threw them roughly into the laundry basket. She used a hair tie left on the sink by Misato, moved halfway to the door to the bathroom proper, then came back to the laundry basket to shove her panties under Misato's shirt. The sight of them reminded her of the dream again, making her tremble.  
明日香气冲冲地走向浴室。今天下午，Penpen 异常执着地试图跟着她进去，于是她用脚把他推了出去。关上折叠门后，她脱下湿漉漉、紧贴身体的内裤，粗鲁地扔进洗衣篮。她用了美里留在洗手台上的发圈，走到浴室门口一半时，又折返回去，将内裤塞到美里的衬衫下面。看到这一幕，她再次想起了那个梦，不由得颤抖起来。

After a short and rough shower, she sat in front of the vanity table. The thoughts she suppressed with hot water returned with force. There were too many unpleasant elements to just brush it off as a simple, silly product of her recent frustration.  
匆匆洗了个粗暴的澡后，她坐在梳妆台前。那些用热水压抑的思绪再次汹涌而来。有太多不愉快的因素，无法简单地将其归咎于近期烦恼的愚蠢产物。

Why on earth did she dream about the boy?  
她究竟为什么会梦到那个男孩？

Mr. Kaji, unlike that child, wasn't a first-time appearance (quite far from it, to be honest), but why did he have to mention Misato? That was the first time he did that in her dream.  
加治先生与那孩子不同，并非首次登场（老实说，远非如此），但他为何要提及美里呢？这是他第一次在她的梦中提到她。

And the rest of it…  
而剩下的部分……

She picked up the hair straightener with a frown. Something pricked her hand. The handle was broken, revealing the inner parts and wires. It looked like something you definitely didn't want to turn on while it's in your hand. It must have broken when she threw it on the floor the day before yesterday, after returning from the hospital. _Should I use Misato's?_ she thought, but so soon after her dream, the mere thought of it disgusted her.  
她皱着眉头拿起直发器。手上有种刺痛感。手柄已损坏，露出了内部零件和电线。这东西在你手里时绝对不想打开。想必是前天从医院回来后，她把它扔到地上时摔坏的。我该用美里的吗？她想，但梦醒不久，光是想到这个就让她感到厌恶。

Snorting contemptuously, Asuka picked up the cell phone. She wanted to direct her attention somewhere else, because if she didn't, thoughts of the dream would come back. Misato's reply had come while she was in the shower.  
轻蔑地哼了一声，明日香拿起手机。她想把注意力转移到别处，因为如果不这样做，梦的记忆就会再次浮现。在她洗澡的时候，美里已经回复了。

_Rei has been busy since yesterday, testing something with Ritsuko. Please, Asuka. Just stop by, stay with him for an hour and I'll buy you a nice dinner.  
从昨天开始，丽就和律子忙着测试什么。拜托了，明日香。你就过去看看他，陪他一个小时，我会请你吃一顿大餐。_

The latter part was barely recognized because the first sentence and its implication grabbed Asuka's attention.  
后半句几乎没被注意到，因为第一句话及其含义抓住了明日香的注意力。

_So you asked her first and only came to me because she was unavailable.  
所以你先问了她，只有在找不到她时才来找我。_

A small voice whispered in her mind that it could be the other way around, that since she was being hard on Misato for two days, she turned to the First as an alternative. But Asuka ignored the voice as she almost always did.  
一个微弱的声音在她脑海中低语，事情可能恰恰相反，因为她对美里严厉了两天，所以转而向初寻求替代。但明日香像往常一样忽略了那个声音。

Instead, she turned her eyes to the mirror.  
相反，她将目光转向了镜子。

The girl in the mirror was very pretty. Asuka was vaguely aware of how it looked to judge herself like that, but still, it was an objective fact.  
镜中的女孩非常漂亮。明日香隐约意识到这样评判自己有些自恋，但无论如何，这是个客观事实。

Then how was this possible? How was she not someone's top priority? Maybe it was somewhat understandable in Mr. Kaji's case, but was she not even on that pathetic little boy's radar?  
那么这怎么可能呢？她怎么不是某人的首要关注？或许在加持先生的情况中还能理解，但她难道连那个可怜小男孩的视线都吸引不了吗？

And why was she feeling guilty all of a sudden? And why was she wondering what she should wear today?  
为什么她突然感到内疚？为什么她还在想今天该穿什么？

---

By the time her phone rang, Misato was skimming through the reports she got from Hyuga earlier. Going back and forth to Geofront hospital every morning and afternoon affected her workflow quite a lot, and she was a busy woman even under the best of circumstances. But she also had several contacts that she was expecting a call from, so she took her phone out in a hurry, moving the fat clipboard under her arm. It was Asuka.  
当她的手机响起时，美里正在浏览从日向那里收到的报告。每天早晚往返于 Geofront 医院大大影响了她的工作流程，即便在最好的情况下，她也是个忙碌的女人。但她还有几个联系人正等着她的回电，所以她急忙掏出手机，将厚厚的文件夹夹在腋下。来电的是明日香。

_Just until dinner. I'm not returning anywhere but home after that, so don't even think of begging otherwise. I don't want to hear how visitors could actually stay until 9 pm or something.  
只到晚餐时间。之后我哪儿也不去，直接回家，所以别想着求我改变主意。我不想听什么访客可以待到晚上 9 点之类的借口。_

As soon as she grabbed the phone with both hands, excited, papers fell free from the clipboard to scatter all over the elevator floor. Her movement pressed the clip, most likely.  
她双手一抓起手机，兴奋之余，文件便从文件夹中散落，撒满了电梯地板。她的动作可能压到了夹子。

"Oh shitshitshitshit…" "哦天哪天哪天哪天哪……"

To make matters worse, the elevator stopped and the door opened while she was squatting to pick up papers. The opening door revealed shoes with brown soil around the soles. They hesitated for a moment, then moved in just before the door closed. Misato was too busy to look up. The smell of cologne mixed with a faint odor of sweat stung her nose. It was an oddly familiar feeling, stopping her motions. A large hand came down and picked up a paper that had flown near the door. Misato smiled brightly and reached out. "Thank you!"  
更糟糕的是，电梯停了下来，门在她蹲下捡文件时打开了。门后露出鞋底沾着褐色泥土的鞋子。它们犹豫了一下，然后在门关闭前移了进来。美里忙得顾不上抬头。古龙水的香味混杂着淡淡的汗味刺痛了她的鼻子。这种感觉出奇地熟悉，让她停下了动作。一只大手伸下来，捡起了飘到门边的一张纸。美里灿烂地笑了，伸出手。"谢谢你！"

"Hey, Katsuragi, I was afraid you'd forgotten that smile for good."  
"嘿，葛城，我还以为你已经彻底忘了怎么笑了呢。"

Misato stood up in a hurry, hissing through her teeth. What a ridiculous situation this whole thing was.  
美里急忙站起身，咬牙切齿地低声抱怨。这整件事真是荒唐至极。

Kaji smiled and fluttered the paper. "I don't mind keeping it, but that would mean a leak from your department."  
加持笑着抖了抖那张纸。“我倒不介意留着它，但这意味着你们部门会泄露消息。”

He watched with a smile as she snatched the paper out of his fingers, put it on the clip, and held the clipboard in front of her like a shield. "No worries. I didn't come here for that today."  
他微笑着看她从他指间夺过那张纸，夹在夹子上，然后像举盾牌一样把夹纸板挡在身前。“别担心。我今天来这里不是为了这个。”

Misato turned her head with a snort. "I'll slap you."  
美里哼了一声，转过头来。“我会扇你一巴掌。”

The corner of Kaji's mouth went up. "I doubt that."  
加持的嘴角微微上扬。“我可不信。”

"You smell terrible. Don't you dare come near me."  
“你臭死了。别靠近我。”

She almost smiled as he sniffed his armpit, the smirk on his face instantly gone. It was a bit of an exaggeration, but whatever. "You wash your clothes, right?"  
她差点笑出声来，他嗅了嗅自己的腋下，脸上的得意瞬间消失。这有点夸张，但无所谓。“你洗衣服的，对吧？”

A smile returned to his face. "I wasn't the one who was lazy with that."  
他的脸上重新露出了笑容。“我可不是那个懒惰的人。”

That strangely bittersweet tone in his voice made her heart ache. Then she chastised herself for her stupidity. She shouldn't lower her guard for that blatant trick.  
"他那奇怪而苦涩的语气让她心痛。随后她责备自己的愚蠢。她不应该对那个明显的伎俩放松警惕。”

"Then what, did the air conditioner break in your office or something like that? Or did you hit the gym during work hours? I don't think they're even open right now."  
"那么，是办公室的空调坏了吗？还是你在工作时间去健身房了？我觉得现在健身房应该都没开门吧。"

Kaji shrugged. "A man's secret."  
加持耸了耸肩。"男人的秘密。"

"Great conspiracy, eh?" "大阴谋，是吧？"

"You might say that." "你可能会这么说。"

So like her father. Kind and cool on the surface. And a line drawn at some arbitrary point, the things beyond it never to be shared with her. Misato narrowed her eyes, recalling Ritsuko's 'hints'. She sighed. "You must be very busy."  
就像她父亲一样。表面上和善而冷静。而在某个随意划定的界限之外，那些事情永远不会与她分享。美里眯起眼睛，回想起律子那些'暗示'。她叹了口气。"你一定很忙吧。"

"Oh, that reminds me." He raised his eyebrows. "Are you available this evening? I found a good place I want to go with you."  
"哦，这倒提醒我了。"他扬起眉毛。"你今晚有空吗？我发现了一个不错的地方，想和你一起去。"

_So that was the plan from the beginning,_ she almost said, but instead she stuck out her tongue. "Nope, have to go to Shinji."  
原来从一开始这就是计划，她差点脱口而出，但最终只是吐了吐舌头。“不，得去找真嗣。”

"Don't you think you've done enough? You know, visiting him twice a day."  
“你不觉得你做得够多了吗？你知道的，一天去看他两次。”

Misato looked blankly at his face for a moment, then opened her mouth.  
美里茫然地盯着他的脸看了一会儿，然后张开了嘴。

"Have you bugged me? How did you know?"  
"你监视我了吗？你怎么知道的？"

That smirk again. "That's how they do it in the movies. I'm not saying it's not done in real life, but you'd be surprised to know how far you could go with just the right amount of OSINT."  
又是那种得意的笑。"电影里都是这么演的。我不是说现实生活中不会这么做，但你可能会惊讶于仅凭恰到好处的开源情报能走多远。"

Misato's heart dropped, a cold sensation all over her chest. He wasn't even trying to hide that he was a spy. He was actually expecting her to know. _What the hell are you doing?!_ The question bubbled up her throat, but Misato didn't say it. "So I guess it's my turn to ask what that acronym stands for and get impressed, huh?"  
美里心中一沉，胸口涌起一股寒意。他甚至不打算掩饰自己是个间谍的事实。他居然还期待她能知道。你到底在干什么？！这个问题在她喉咙里翻腾，但美里没有说出口。"所以我想该轮到我问那个缩写代表什么，然后大吃一惊了，对吧？"

Kaji burst out laughing. "Well, I've found there's an upper age limit on that trick."  
加持爆发出一阵大笑。“好吧，我发现这个把戏有个年龄上限。”

Misato snorted. The elevator stopped with a ding on the floor where Misato's office was located, so she walked out. Kaji followed her, as she expected. She smiled at him sideways. "Since I'm an old hag who's too old to be impressed, it wouldn't be too strange for me to refuse your invitation, right?"  
美里哼了一声。电梯在到达美里办公室所在的楼层时发出叮的一声停了下来，于是她走了出去。加持跟在她后面，正如她所料。她侧过头对他微笑。“既然我是个老太婆，年纪大到不会被你打动，拒绝你的邀请也不算太奇怪，对吧？”

Kaji raised both hands in a hurry. Quite a familiar gesture, all the exaggeration included. Misato turned away with a sinking feeling. He knew what she found cute, and what she loved. It was a trap, intended or not. Once she stepped in it, there was no going back, even though she knew the consequences from the start.  
加持急忙举起双手。这个动作相当熟悉，所有的夸张都包含在内。美里转过身去，心中感到一阵沉重。他知道她觉得什么可爱，她爱什么。这是一个陷阱，有意或无意。一旦她踏入其中，就无法回头，尽管她从一开始就知道后果。

"That's not what I meant."  
"那不是我的意思。"

Misato walked in the direction of the office. "And that doesn't matter. I told you I can't, because of Shinji."  
美里朝着办公室的方向走去。“而且那无关紧要。我告诉过你我不能，因为真嗣。”

"And I told you that you don't have to do that."  
“我也告诉过你，你不必那样做。”

Misato stopped, turned around and crossed her arms. "What do you mean?"  
美里停下脚步，转过身来交叉双臂。“你什么意思？”

Kaji's face was guarded, but there was no hesitation in his words. "There's ultimately one thing he's waiting and wishing for, and it's not you, Katsuragi. It's the Commander. The guy who never visits his hospitalized son. That void in Shinji's heart is not something you could fill."  
加持的脸色谨慎，但他的话语中没有丝毫犹豫。“他最终等待和期盼的只有一件事，不是你，葛城。是司令。那个从不探望住院儿子的男人。真嗣心中的空洞，不是你能填补的。”

Seeing Misato's souring face, he hastily added. "I'm not saying what you're doing is bad or meaningless. No, quite the opposite. I'm sure you're doing a wonderful job for him. A really good thing. But you don't need to kill yourself for something impossible. You shouldn't tie yourself to a lost cause. You can still commit yourself to things you could realistically do, but anything more than that would hurt both parties in the end. There's this thing we call a healthy distance, right?"  
看到美里脸色变差，他急忙补充道。“我不是说你做的是坏事或毫无意义。不，恰恰相反。我相信你为他做得很好。真的是件好事。但你不需要为了不可能的事而牺牲自己。你不应该把自己绑在一个注定失败的事业上。你仍然可以投身于你能实际做到的事情，但超过这一点最终只会伤害双方。我们称之为健康的距离，对吧？”

_So smart,_ Misato thought, fiddling with her phone. _A healthy distance, huh? Something that others can't fill._ "I'm not irrationally tying myself to anything."  
真聪明，美里心想，摆弄着手机。保持健康距离，是吧？那种别人无法填补的距离。“我并没有不理智地把自己绑在任何东西上。”

Kaji grinned. There was a time she felt full just by looking at that smile.  
加持笑了。曾经有一段时间，光是看到那个笑容就能让她感到满足。

"So you mean you could spare a night for nice sushi, right? The place I found is one of the only proper places in this, eh, nouveau-riche city, or so everyone says. You can imagine how hard it was to make reservations on Saturday night, right? What do you think?"  
“所以你是说，你可以抽出一晚来享受美味的寿司，对吧？我发现的那家店是这座暴发户城市里为数不多的正宗地方之一，大家都这么说。你能想象周六晚上订位有多难吗？你觉得怎么样？”

Misato toyed with the idea for a moment. There were so many reasons to refuse, not just limited to something related to Shinji. _Don't do this, don't walk this road, you know what lies down there,_ her intuition screamed at her.  
美里把这念头在脑中转了一会儿。拒绝的理由太多了，不仅仅是因为涉及真嗣。别这么做，别走这条路，你知道那下面有什么，她的直觉在她耳边尖叫。

"… I'll consider it." “……我会考虑的。”

---

Asuka had no problem getting to the hospital from home. Simpler still was the reception desk and the visitor's card. After arriving at the door to Shinji's ward, Asuka started to feel conflicted. The sense of anger and humiliation that she kept pushing away had returned.  
从家里到医院，对明日香来说并不困难。更简单的是接待台和访客卡的办理。到达真嗣病房门口后，明日香开始感到矛盾。那种她一直试图压抑的愤怒和屈辱感又回来了。

The more she thought about it, the more ridiculous the whole situation became. Why did she have to accept this humiliating rejection?  
她越想越觉得整个情况荒谬至极。为什么她非得接受这屈辱的拒绝呢？

The door in front of her felt more like a wall. The thought made Asuka clench her teeth and pressed the open button.  
眼前的门感觉更像是一堵墙。这个念头让明日香咬紧牙关，按下了开门按钮。

Asuka strode into the room. She spotted a wheeled stand and an IV bag hanging from it, both of which were absent during her last visit two days ago. Below the drooping line, the boy slept in the same drooping manner. That thing must be a painkiller, she concluded. It's not like he had a limb amputated or an actual surgery or something. The pain couldn't possibly be severe enough for a drip feed of painkillers directly into his veins.  
明日香大步走进房间。她注意到一个带轮子的架子和挂在上面的输液袋，这两样东西在她两天前的上次探访时并不存在。输液管下垂着，男孩也以同样的姿态睡着。那东西肯定是止痛药，她断定。他又没有截肢或动什么大手术，疼痛程度怎么可能严重到需要直接静脉注射止痛药。

_They really don't know anything._ Chewing on her old contempt for plebs, Asuka headed toward the chair by the bedside, opposite the window. Only after sitting down did she realize that Shinji's back was to her. That was weirdly infuriating, so Asuka picked up the chair and headed for the other side of the bed. She wasn't quiet about it, but Shinji didn't wake up.  
他们真的什么都不知道。Asuka 一边咀嚼着对平民的旧有轻蔑，一边走向窗边床旁的椅子。坐下后，她才发现 Shinji 背对着她。这奇怪地让她恼火，于是 Asuka 拿起椅子，走向床的另一边。她动静不小，但 Shinji 并未醒来。

Asuka rested her chin on her hand and looked into his peaceful sleeping face. Time passed. Or not. Soon she felt disengaged from the concept of the flow of time itself. Her head was filled with so many conflicting feelings.  
Asuka 用手托着下巴，凝视着他平静的睡颜。时间流逝。或者没有。很快，她感觉自己与时间的流动概念脱节了。她的脑海中充满了许多矛盾的情感。

Things from the past reared their heads pulled from distant memories by her current surroundings. The stench of a sick person, subtle under the much stronger smell of medicine. Revulsion. Helplessness. Regret.  
过去的种种在当前环境的牵引下，从遥远的记忆中浮现。病人体味的臭气，在更浓烈的药味下隐约可闻。厌恶。无助。悔恨。

She realized that she was at least partially responsible for what she was seeing now. She wanted to reject the realization. Disgust. At herself. At Shinji.  
她意识到自己至少对眼前所见负有部分责任。她想要拒绝这个认识。厌恶。对自己。对真嗣。

And the dream she had today. The frustration, constantly built up. Disappointment. Hate. At Mr. Kaji. At Misato. At Shinji. At Shinji.  
还有今天的梦。那不断累积的挫败感。失望。恨意。对加持先生。对美里。对真嗣。对真嗣。

Her emotions were a raging storm, and the boy in front of her was the epicenter. That someone like him could do that to her was unimaginable. But the truth of her feelings for him was already surfacing in some parts of her heart.  
她的情绪如狂风暴雨，而眼前的男孩正是风暴的中心。像他这样的人能对她产生如此影响，简直难以想象。但对他情感的真相，已在她的内心某些角落浮现。

The corners of her mouth curled up helplessly, making an expression that she could never show anyone. The one responsible for it was still asleep, his own face calm.  
她的嘴角不由自主地翘起，露出了一个她绝不会向任何人展示的表情。造成这一切的那个人仍在熟睡，自己的脸庞平静无波。

And yes, he was responsible for it. Asuka, at this point, was aware that denying the fact out of pride was meaningless and would just make things worse. Continuing to pick on Shinji while at the same time denying her feelings for him would lead somewhere awful. It would make her worse than that gold digging stepmother of hers. At least the woman bagged the man, after all. At this point, Asuka figured she should stop asking 'really?' and instead ask 'why' or 'how'.  
没错，他确实要为此负责。此时此刻，明日香明白，出于骄傲而否认这一事实毫无意义，只会让事情变得更糟。一边继续挑衅真嗣，一边又否认自己对他的感情，这只会走向糟糕的境地。这让她比她那位贪财的继母还要恶劣。至少那个女人最终还是得到了那个男人。到了这个地步，明日香觉得她应该停止问‘真的吗？’，而是问‘为什么’或‘怎样’。

Seriously. Why? Asuka searched the sleeping face for an answer.  
说真的，为什么？明日香在熟睡的脸庞上寻找着答案。

His delicate jawline was one that most girls would envy. It was smooth and completely hairless, nary a whisker to be seen. It connected to a long, slender neck, which swooped beneath the neckline of his hospital gown to connect to a sharp, prominent collarbone. So skinny. How could a boy be that skinny? Narrow-shouldered, too. His Adam's apple was only a vague suggestion; his voice hadn't even really dropped much yet. And he was short, shorter even than Asuka. It was as if someone intentionally built the antithesis of Mr. Kaji in the form of a fourteen-year-old boy. So, then, _why?_  
他那精致的颌线，是多数女孩都会羡慕的。光滑无瑕，一根胡须也看不见。连接着修长纤细的脖颈，顺着医院病号服的领口向下延伸至尖锐突出的锁骨。如此瘦削。一个男孩怎能瘦成这样？肩膀也窄。他的喉结只是隐约可见；声音也未曾真正变粗。而且他个子矮，甚至比明日香还要矮。仿佛有人刻意以一个十四岁少年的形态，塑造了加治先生的对立面。那么，为何？

His lips twitched, murmuring gibberish. The sight filled Asuka with a strange impulse.  
他的嘴唇微微抽动，喃喃自语着无意义的音节。这一幕让明日香涌起一种莫名的冲动。

What would happen if she kissed him? It could be a revenge for what happened before. Maybe that oaf really needed such extreme measures to wake up. Like Sleeping Beauty, except Shinji was no beauty and she wasn't a prince. Maybe he'd wake up and kiss her back and all her frustrating ambiguities and doubts would be solved. She'll still have to make up an excuse, no matter how ridiculous it was. But it would wake him up, both literally and figuratively.  
如果她吻了他会怎样？这或许是对之前发生之事的一种报复。也许那个笨蛋真的需要如此极端的手段才能醒来。就像睡美人，只不过真嗣并非美人，而她也不是王子。或许他会醒来并回吻她，她那些令人烦躁的模糊与疑虑都将迎刃而解。无论如何，她都得编个借口，哪怕再荒谬。但这会让他醒来，无论是字面意义还是象征意义。

She found herself leaning forward. Slowly, carefully. Then she remembered his boldness in her dream. That made her angry, so she leaned down quickly. He stank, like he did two days ago, but Asuka didn't mind both now and then.  
她发现自己不由自主地前倾。慢慢地，小心翼翼地。随后她想起了他在梦中的大胆举动。这让她生气，于是她迅速俯下身去。他身上依旧散发着两天前的臭味，但明日香现在并不介意偶尔这样。

Shinji frowned. Forgetting all of her previous resolve, Asuka froze in fear. _What should I say when he wakes up? Do I have to say there was something on his face?_  
真嗣皱起了眉头。忘记了之前的所有决心，明日香因恐惧而僵住了。他醒来时我该说什么？我是不是得说他脸上有东西？

Shinji solved the problem for her. His face contorted in pain. Asuka watched, spellbound, as tears began leaking from beneath his lashes and flooded down his slightly gaunt cheeks.  
真嗣替她解决了问题。他的脸因痛苦而扭曲。明日香看得入神，只见泪水开始从他的睫毛下渗出，顺着他略显消瘦的脸颊流淌下来。

"Father…I want to see Mother…don't leave me."  
"父亲……我想见母亲……别丢下我。"

Asuka sat up. Her hand went out reflexively then stopped mid-air. She didn't even know why it did that. Her heart throbbed for a second and then cooled down. She watched his chest heave and his breathing hitch, her lips slightly parted. Then her whole face twisted with disgust.  
明日香坐起身来。她的手本能地伸出去，却在半空中停住了。她甚至不明白自己为何会这样做。她的心跳加速了一瞬，随即又平静下来。她注视着他的胸膛起伏，呼吸急促，嘴唇微微张开。接着，她的整张脸因厌恶而扭曲。

_Why are you being such a child? You're a boy. And it's not like you have it any harder than I do.  
为什么表现得像个孩子？你是男孩。况且你的处境并不比我更艰难。_

She clenched her teeth. Yeah, that was right. This spoiled child didn't witness his mother die right in front of his eyes. She didn't know where his mother was or anything about her, but whatever. It didn't matter. It was probably a divorce or something boring like that. And what about his father? What the hell was wrong with this boy? She knew they didn't get along well, but surely the Commander cared about his son. Why would he bestow the greatest honor possible upon him if he didn't? The kid didn't do anything to deserve the privilege of piloting Eva, but it was handed to him because of his father's favor. Nepotism at its finest. So disgusting. And he's _still_ complaining!  
她咬紧牙关。没错，就是这样。这个被宠坏的孩子并未亲眼目睹母亲在他眼前死去。她不知道他母亲在哪里，也不了解任何关于她的事情，但无所谓了。这无关紧要。可能只是离婚之类无聊的事吧。那他的父亲呢？这小子到底有什么问题？她知道他们关系不好，但指挥官肯定关心自己的儿子。如果不在乎，又怎会赐予他这份无上的荣耀？这孩子并未做出任何值得驾驶 Eva 的功绩，只因父亲的偏爱便得到了这份特权。真是赤裸裸的裙带关系。太令人作呕了。而他还在抱怨！

Her outstretched hand shook in anger. Maybe she should hate him, come to think of it. Maybe she should slap him with this hand. Strangle him, even. She probably had more reasons to do it than reasons to not. No, not _probably._ She _definitely_ had reasons: valid, concrete reasons. The humiliation she felt the day before yesterday came to her mind again. The feeling of betrayal she felt at his rejection, a hatred growing as big as her former hope.  
她伸出的手因愤怒而颤抖。或许，她应该恨他，仔细想想。或许她应该用这只手扇他一巴掌。甚至掐死他。她可能有更多理由这么做，而不是不这么做。不，不是可能。她确实有理由：正当、具体的理由。前天感受到的屈辱再次涌上心头。被他拒绝时的背叛感，以及随之膨胀的恨意，如同她曾经的希望一般巨大。

With a swollen throat, Asuka reached out and wiped Shinji's wet cheeks.  
喉咙肿痛的明日香伸出手，拭去了真嗣湿漉漉的脸颊上的泪水。

The pain melted away from his face.  
他脸上的痛苦渐渐消融。

"You're just a child," whispered Asuka, sighing.  
“你只是个孩子，”明日香轻声叹息道。

The cell phone rang at that very moment, making Asuka jump a bit. She quickly withdrew her hand, leaned back against the back of the chair and pulled out the phone. It was Misato's text.  
就在这时，手机铃声响起，吓得明日香一跳。她迅速抽回手，向后靠在椅背上，掏出手机。是美里发来的短信。

_Asuka, I'm really sorry. I got a last minute appointment. I think I can go back before the visit time ends if I try, but I guess it's too much to ask you to stay there until then, right? Maybe dinner should wait until Shinji's discharge. Again, I'm very sorry.  
明日香，真的很抱歉。我临时有个会面。我想如果抓紧时间，应该能在探视时间结束前赶回去，但要求你一直等到那时候，似乎太过分了，对吧？或许晚餐还是等到真嗣出院再说吧。再次，我非常抱歉。_

Feeling a cold weight settle in her stomach, Asuka wrote a simple reply that she understood and sent it.  
明日香感到一股寒意沉入胃中，她简单回复了一句理解，并发送了出去。

After a moment of consideration she began to write a new text.  
经过片刻的考虑，她开始撰写一条新的信息。

_Mr. Kaji, about dinner,_ Asuka's fingers stopped there. What about dinner? Would it be better to ignore this foreboding in her mind and try something that definitely wouldn't work Or would it just be better to give up early and avoid embarrassment? Asuka frowned and continued the text. _I don't think I can go, too busy with school stuff! Maybe we should find a better day next week or something._  
加治先生，关于晚餐，明日香的手指停在了那里。晚餐怎么办？是应该无视心中的不祥预感，尝试一些肯定行不通的方法，还是干脆早点放弃，避免尴尬？明日香皱了皱眉，继续写道：我觉得我去不了，学校的事情太忙了！或许我们应该找下周更合适的日子。

Asuka had not even turned off the screen when the message came back.  
明日香甚至还没来得及关闭屏幕，回复就来了。

_I see. I got a notification I couldn't refuse just a moment ago and was wondering what to tell you, actually. I guess it's all fine then, what a relief. You should eat well, Asuka. Even if there's no Shinji to cook for you.  
我明白了。刚才收到一条无法拒绝的通知，还在想该怎么告诉你呢。看来一切都好，真是松了口气。你要好好吃饭，明日香。即使没有真嗣给你做饭。_

A bitter smirk twisted Asuka's mouth. To think that she, just a few minutes ago, thought she could choose between two dinner appointments today.  
明日香嘴角勾起一抹苦笑。就在几分钟前，她还以为自己今天可以选择两个晚餐邀约中的一个。

She saw something stirring in her periphery. She probably woke the boy up with the constant text chimes. Asuka folded her phone and raised her eyes. He was still lying as he did before, staring at her with blank eyes that were still rather wet.  
她察觉到视线边缘有什么在动。可能是连续不断的短信提示声把男孩吵醒了。明日香合上手机，抬起眼。他依旧躺在那里，眼神空洞，眼角还带着湿润。

"Asuka? Is that you?" “明日香？是你吗？”

Asuka raised her chin. "Did they inject you with idiot medicine or what? Of course it's me."  
明日香扬起下巴。“他们给你注射了傻瓜药还是怎么的？当然是我。”

Shinji blinked. Asuka crossed both her legs and arms. "Misato begged me so much that I had to cancel a dinner appointment and come here. Got anything to say?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼。明日香交叉双臂和双腿。“美里求了我好久，我不得不取消晚餐约会赶来这里。你有什么要说的吗？”

Shinji blinked, faster than a moment ago. A stray tear slipped out, unnoticed. His mouth opened and closed again.  
真嗣眨眼的速度比刚才更快了。一滴不经意间滑落的泪水悄然无声。他的嘴巴张开又闭上。

"I, I'm sorry." “我，我很抱歉。”

_Is he really sorry? He's probably so doped up on pain meds that he'd have a panic attack if I ask what he's even sorry about,_ she thought. Asuka sighed. "Just shut up."  
他真的感到抱歉吗？他可能被止痛药弄得晕头转向，我要是问他在为什么道歉，他估计会恐慌发作，她心想。明日香叹了口气。“闭嘴就好。”

### Chapter 5 You can't

Sunday night. 星期天晚上。

The air in Shinji's room was hot and stuffy, especially after spending so many days in the air-conditioned hospital. And it was dark. The room, formerly a storage closet before Asuka ousted him, didn't even have a window. Now that he turned off the lamp, the only source of light was a thin sliver of moonlight seeping through the space between the floor and the door. It was so dark that he could barely make out his own hand in front of him, although he still could see the dim outline of the wall farthest from his bed, where he was lying now. Anyone with even mild claustrophobia would not survive in this room. That made him wonder if it was any better than the hospital room he spent the last few days in, in terms of quality of life. Some aspects of it were definitely worse. However, the deafening silence soon reminded him of the one clear advantage this place had.  
真嗣房间里的空气闷热而压抑，尤其是在医院空调房里待了那么多天后。而且这里很暗。这个房间，原本是个储藏室，直到明日香把他赶了出去，连一扇窗户都没有。现在他关掉了台灯，唯一的光源是透过地板和门之间缝隙渗入的一线月光。如此昏暗，他几乎看不清自己眼前的手，尽管他仍能隐约看到离床最远的墙壁轮廓，他现在正躺在那里。即使是轻微的幽闭恐惧症患者也无法在这个房间里生存。这让他不禁思考，就生活质量而言，这里是否比他最近几天住的医院病房更好。某些方面显然更糟。然而，震耳欲聋的寂静很快提醒他这个地方的一个明显优势。

Privacy. The first he'd enjoyed after a few days of the complete absence of it. He almost forgot the taste of such a thing.  
隐私。这是他在完全失去隐私的几天后首次享受到的东西。他几乎忘记了这种感觉。

Well, he didn't really forget about it. He was actually waiting for this very moment. Five days in the hospital. That alone was already long enough, without Asuka doing her best to…  
好吧，他并没有真的忘记。他实际上一直在等待这一刻。在医院里待了五天。仅此一点就已经够长了，更不用说还有明日香竭尽全力……

Shinji sat up and looked at the door. The whole apartment was silent as the grave. Ms. Misato and Asuka must have fallen asleep. His eyes went to the tissue box on his desk, and then to the palm of his right hand. He turned it to look at the back of it, an amorphous shape in the dark, then turned it over again. He clenched it into a fist and opened it, over and over.  
真嗣坐起身，望向门口。整个公寓静得像座坟墓。美里小姐和明日香肯定已经睡着了。他的目光移到桌上的纸巾盒，然后又看向右手掌心。他在黑暗中翻转手掌，看着那模糊的形状，接着又翻转回来。他握紧拳头，又松开，一遍又一遍。

He wasn't sure if the thing he was about to do was indeed wise. Earlier today he'd gotten a doctor's note that stated he couldn't participate in PE class. Of course, this particular action wasn't as strenuous as regular exercise, but he wasn't sure if his schoolwork tomorrow would be totally unaffected by it.  
他不确定即将要做的事情是否明智。今天早些时候，他拿到了一张医生开的证明，说他不能参加体育课。当然，这个特定动作不像常规锻炼那样剧烈，但他不确定明天的学业是否会完全不受影响。

But still… 但尽管如此……

The next moment found Shinji lying on his back, pants down, a single tissue in his hand. Ever since he moved into this house, and especially after Asuka moved into this house, he never needed a magazine or a picture or a video or anything at all for that matter. It was so shameless, but he just couldn't help it. His mind's eye had already conjured up Asuka, naked and on top of him. It had to be that way. It was almost impossible for him to imagine her in any other position. And picturing her body, at least, was not difficult. It didn't require much imagination at all. Some of it was due to the problematic design of their plugsuits, and another part stemmed from the unavoidable consequences of sharing a house with someone. There were things you couldn't help but notice. But it was also partially Asuka's own doing, the result of intentionally flaunting herself to Shinji (and he was quite certain it was intentional). As a result, there were fewer places on Asuka's body that Shinji _couldn't_ imagine than he could.  
下一刻，真嗣发现自己仰面躺着，裤子褪下，手里捏着一张纸巾。自从搬进这栋房子，尤其是明日香也搬进来后，他再也不需要杂志、图片、视频或任何其他东西来助兴。这实在无耻，但他就是控制不住。他的脑海中已经浮现出明日香赤裸着压在他身上的画面。必须是这样的场景。他几乎无法想象她处于其他任何姿势。而想象她的身体，至少，并不困难。这根本不需要多少想象力。一部分原因是他们的插入栓服设计有问题，另一部分则源于与某人同住一个屋檐下不可避免的后果。有些事情你无法不注意到。但这也有一部分是明日香自己的原因，是她有意向真嗣炫耀的结果（他相当确定这是故意的）。因此，在明日香身上，真嗣想象不到的地方比他能想象到的要少。

What really gave Shinji some trouble were other things. Like the expression on Asuka's face as she moved. Hungry. Wanting him. Or the sweet words that she leaned over and whispered in his ears. That she had always wanted him, that she wanted him to come into her room that night, that she didn't really mind his attempted kiss. That she was grateful he jumped into a volcano to save her, that she wanted to repay him in her own way, if only he didn't mind. Ridiculous fantasies. Too gratuitous and masturbatory to even Shinji himself. He wanted to laugh at himself, but his hand didn't slow down, instead speeding up as if it had a mind of its own, and what escaped from his lips was not laughter, but something else.  
真正让真嗣感到困扰的是其他事情。比如明日香移动时脸上的表情。饥渴。渴望他。或者是她俯身在他耳边低语的甜言蜜语。她一直想要他，她希望他那晚能进入她的房间，她并不介意他试图亲吻她。她感激他跳进火山救她，她想用自己的方式回报他，只要他不介意。荒谬的幻想。太过放纵和自慰，甚至连真嗣自己都觉得过分。他想嘲笑自己，但他的手并没有放慢，反而加速，仿佛有自己的意志，从他唇间流露出的不是笑声，而是别的什么。

"Asuka, Asuka…" “明日香，明日香……”

It was a dangerous thing he did. The paper doors in this apartment weren't soundproof at all. Sometimes you could hear someone tossing and turning in their futon in the dead quiet of the night. Shinji occasionally heard such noises coming from the room across from his. But he couldn't stop himself now. Because the Asuka in his mind was looking down at him with a wistful smile on her flushed face, breasts heaving, whispering _oh, yes, you liked me too, didn't you, all along…_  
他这么做很危险。这套公寓的纸门根本不隔音。有时在夜深人静时，你能听到有人在被褥里辗转反侧。真嗣偶尔会听到对面房间传来这样的声响。但他现在无法自控。因为脑海中的明日香正垂眸望着他，双颊绯红，带着一丝惆怅的微笑，胸脯起伏，低声呢喃着，哦，是的，你一直也喜欢我，对吧……

Shinji came so hard it made him gasp.  
真嗣高潮得喘不过气来。

_But you_ never _liked me,_ Shinji thought while cleaning himself up. He wondered how Asuka would react if she knew that he used her this way. The mere thought of it mortified him. On its heels came anger, oddly intense. What the hell did she expect, anyway? Putting her body tantalizingly close to his all the time, teasing him with something that she would never in a million years give to him.  
但你从未喜欢过我，真嗣在清理自己时想道。他不知道明日香如果知道他这样利用她会有何反应。光是想到这一点就让他感到羞愧。紧接着是愤怒，出奇地强烈。她到底期望什么呢？总是把身体诱人地贴近他，用她永远不可能给他的东西来挑逗他。

Abruptly, anger gave way to self-hatred. He felt disgusted with himself for being angry at Asuka. Acting this pathetic was probably the source of all his woes in the first place. Shinji buried his head in the pillow and sighed. Fatigue engulfed him. It was not as satisfying a night as he hoped. Would it have been better to put it off for a day or two? But to do so meant…  
突然间，愤怒转变成了自我厌恶。他对自己对明日香发火感到恶心。表现得如此可怜，或许正是他所有烦恼的根源。真嗣把头埋进枕头里，叹了口气。疲惫感吞没了他。这个夜晚并不如他所希望的那样令人满足。推迟一两天会不会更好呢？但这样做意味着……

Shinji lifted his right hand, staring at it. He had to do it today. Because he feared he might forget the warmth of the touch he tasted yesterday and today.  
真嗣举起右手，凝视着它。他今天必须这么做。因为他担心自己可能会忘记昨天和今天所感受到的触摸的温暖。

---

"How long are you supposed to eat that?"  
“你打算吃那东西多久？”

It was Asuka's first question after barging into his hospital room. More precisely, it was the first question she'd asked that was remotely related to Shinji's well-being. Shinji was used to her chattering about nothing, so the question didn't register at first. He just nodded without answering. Only after he took a spoonful of congee into his mouth did he realize what she asked. He put down his spoon and turned his head to Asuka's window-side chair, where she was staring at her cell phone while nibbling at some bread she bought from the cafeteria earlier.  
这是明日香闯进他病房后的第一个问题。更确切地说，这是她问的第一个与真嗣的安危稍微相关的问题。真嗣已经习惯了她喋喋不休地说些无关紧要的事，所以一开始这个问题并没有引起他的注意。他只是点了点头，没有回答。直到他舀了一勺粥放进嘴里，才意识到她问了什么。他放下勺子，转头看向明日香坐在窗边的椅子上，她正盯着手机，同时啃着早些时候从食堂买来的面包。

"For a week. At least that's what the doctor said."  
“一周吧。至少医生是这么说的。”

"Hmmm," she said. "Then you're not going to be able to cook for Misato and me, are you?"  
“嗯，”她说，“那你岂不是不能给我们做饭了？”

He suppressed a bitter smile. _Of course that's your primary concern._ "You don't have to worry about that, Asuka. Congee is so easy to make, all I have to do is just keep an extra pot boiling. And I'll probably only need to cook a single large batch every day, nothing else."  
他压下了一丝苦笑。当然，那是你最关心的事。“你不必担心这个，明日香。粥做起来很简单，我只需要多煮一锅就行了。而且我可能每天只需要煮一大锅，别的什么都不用。”

Asuka's eyes darted up and went back to the phone again. "What about lunch? Are you going to keep making bento for me?"  
明日香的目光迅速上移，又回到了手机上。“那午餐呢？你还会继续给我做便当吗？”

"Yes, yes, of course I will."  
“是的，是的，当然会的。”

He was smiling as he put another spoonful of congee in his mouth. Then he felt a strange atmosphere coming from Asuka, so he turned his eyes to her. His smile washed away immediately. Asuka was glaring at him, cell phone put away. "What's with that tone?"  
"他一边微笑着将另一勺粥送入口中，一边察觉到来自明日香的不寻常气氛，于是将目光转向她。笑容立刻消失了。明日香正瞪着他，手机已经收起。“你那是什么语气？””

Shinji's heart raced. The fact that he felt lonely and bored yesterday without her felt ridiculous. Was it really good for his mental and physical health to be constantly worried about every single little action of his, for fear it would elicit an even worse reaction from her? More than half of the time whatever set her off seemed to be completely random, too.  
"真嗣的心跳加速了。昨天没有她在身边感到孤独和无聊，这事实在荒谬。总是担心自己的每一个小动作，生怕会引起她更糟糕的反应，这对他的身心健康真的好吗？大多数时候，似乎无论什么事情都能激怒她，而且往往毫无征兆。”

"Oh, nothing. I mean, literally. I'll do it."  
"“哦，没什么。我是说，真的没什么。我会做的。””

He hurriedly averted his eyes back to the plate in front of him. Asuka kept her glare for a while, then she too returned to her cell phone and bread.  
他急忙将目光移回到面前的盘子上。明日香继续瞪了一会儿，随后她也回到了自己的手机和面包上。

"If you're that tired, just say so. Not like I can't deal with my own lunch."  
“如果你那么累，就直接说。又不是我不能自己解决午餐。”

The words made Shinji's heart strangely heavy. Engulfed by feelings he couldn't explain, he put down the spoon and turned to Asuka again. She shrugged at him, nonchalantly. "Who said you're supposed to feed me? Or that I'm supposed to be fed by you? You don't need to act like you're obligated to or something."  
这些话让真嗣的心感到莫名的沉重。被无法解释的情感包围，他放下勺子再次转向明日香。她对他耸了耸肩，满不在乎地说：“谁说你得喂我？或者我得让你喂？你不必表现得好像有义务似的。”

Shinji kept his mouth shut, unsure of what to make of the strange feelings he felt now. Asuka took another bite of her bread, expression unchanged, checked her phone while chewing, then raised her eyebrows as if surprised by Shinji's gaze.  
真嗣紧闭着嘴，对现在这种奇怪的感觉不知所措。明日香又咬了一口面包，表情毫无变化，边嚼边查看手机，然后挑了挑眉，似乎对真嗣的目光感到意外。

"What? Is there a reason I don't know about? Or do you want to cook for me that badly?"  
“怎么了？有什么我不知道的原因吗？还是你那么想给我做饭？”

Shinji swallowed. He couldn't say that he disliked the sight of her clean bento box, bereft of even a single grain of rice, whenever he opened it for dishwashing. Cooking was one of the only skills that he possessed and was proud of, and it felt so good to be recognized for it.  
真嗣咽了咽口水。他不能说自己不喜欢每次洗碗时打开她的便当盒，看到里面干净得连一粒米都不剩的景象。做饭是他为数不多掌握并引以为傲的技能之一，能因此得到认可让他感觉很好。

Maybe the "recognition" was just his delusion. Shinji shook his head bitterly. "Not really, but… I'll have to make mine anyway. It'd probably be more efficient to just do it all at once. And there's no reason to stop doing something that I've been doing all the time anyway."  
或许那所谓的“认可”只是他的一厢情愿。真嗣苦涩地摇了摇头。“并不完全是，但……我还是得做我的事。一次性完成可能会更有效率。而且，也没有理由停止我一直都在做的事情。”

After a few moments, Asuka nodded. "Whatever. Such a boring reason."  
片刻后，明日香点了点头。“随你怎么说。真是个无聊的理由。”

A long silence ensued after that. After Shinji finished eating and tried to stand up to return the tray to the designated panel in the corridor outside, Asuka snatched it away from him. He muttered his thanks in a crawling voice, but she ignored him. The uncomfortable silence was broken only after he finished brushing his teeth and returned to the room. Asuka was already back in her chair by then, her gaze fixed on the phone.  
之后是一阵漫长的沉默。真嗣吃完饭后试图站起来，将托盘归还到走廊外的指定面板，但明日香抢先一步拿走了。他低声道谢，声音几乎听不清，但她置若罔闻。直到他刷完牙回到房间，那令人不适的沉默才被打破。那时明日香已经回到了她的椅子上，目光紧盯着手机。

"You're sick, aren't you? Misato said so."  
"你生病了，对吧？美里这么说的。"

_Of course I'm sick, that's why I'm stuck here,_ Shinji thought, then realized she was speaking of something else. _Maybe I really am an idiot like she says._  
当然我生病了，不然我怎么会困在这里，真嗣心想，随即意识到她在说别的事情。也许我真的像她说的那样是个傻瓜。

"Oh, yeah, sometimes. Sometimes I feel like I'm back in the volcano. Can't breathe well, and the pressure, the heat…" He trailed off as Asuka nodded indifferently, her eyes still on the phone. He didn't want another silent moment, so he opened his mouth again. "How about you, Asuka? Was it weird for you too? After the volcano, I mean."  
"哦，是的，有时候。有时候我感觉自己又回到了火山里。呼吸困难，还有那压力，那热度……" 他话没说完，因为明日香漠不关心地点了点头，眼睛依旧盯着手机。他不想再陷入沉默，于是又开口道："你呢，明日香？对你来说也很奇怪吗？我是说火山之后。"

Asuka still didn't raise her head from the cell phone. "Of course not. That's such an entry-level problem. Your head is still not accustomed to synchronizing with Eva. It still can't tell the difference between what's real and what's not. It's not your first time either, right?"  
明日香依旧没有从手机上抬起头来。“当然不会。这种问题太初级了。你的大脑还没习惯与 Eva 同步。它还分不清现实和虚幻。这也不是你第一次经历，对吧？”

He nodded, staring down at his own hand. He still remembered the day after his first sortie like it was yesterday. How he woke up in this very same hospital. "Yeah, but it's never been this bad. Just some throbbing in my wrist, or tingling in my chest, lasting just a single day or so. It's the first time I actually feel everything all over again, and many times a day too, even after a few days have passed."  
他点点头，盯着自己的手。他仍然记得第一次出击后的第二天，仿佛就在昨天。他在这家医院醒来。“是的，但从未这么严重过。只是手腕有些刺痛，或者胸口发麻，持续一两天而已。这次是第一次真正感受到全身的反应，而且一天多次，甚至几天后依然如此。”

Asuka snorted. _What now?_ Shinji thought, turning his head towards her, but she wasn't even looking at him and her face was blank. He was wondering what she was doing with her phone when she opened her mouth.  
明日香哼了一声。怎么了？真嗣心想，转头看向她，但她并没有看他，脸上毫无表情。他正疑惑她在手机上做什么，她却开口了。

"The higher your synchro rate goes, the greater and the more real the pain. There's nothing you can do about it. Just get used to it."  
"同步率越高，痛苦就越强烈、越真实。你对此无能为力，只能习惯它。"

"How am I supposed to get used to this?" Shinji shut his mouth as Asuka glared at him. Those blue eyes were full of contempt, and he knew what she would say even before she spoke.  
"我怎么可能习惯这种事？" 真嗣闭上了嘴，因为明日香瞪着他。那双蓝眼睛里充满了轻蔑，他甚至在她开口前就知道她要说什么。

"You're a boy. Man up. Stop whining like a child."  
"你是男孩子。坚强点。别像个孩子一样抱怨。"

Shinji expected every single word verbatim, but it still stung. He felt a fire roaring from his stomach. _You're an elite pilot, trained since childhood. I didn't even know what Eva was until recently, until my father literally threw me into one. You wouldn't have been any better than me if you were in my position._ He wanted to say all those things, but he swallowed them all. He had a hunch that verbalizing even a single one would end their uneasy relationship. Whatever that relationship was.  
真嗣本以为每个字都听得清清楚楚，但仍感到一阵刺痛。他觉得肚子里燃起了一团火。你是精英驾驶员，从小接受训练。我直到最近才知道什么是 EVA，直到我父亲直接把我扔进一台里。如果你处在我的位置，未必会比我做得更好。他想把这些话全说出来，但还是咽了回去。他有种预感，哪怕只说出一个字，都会结束他们这段不稳定的友谊。无论这段关系是什么。

"I'm sorry…" "我很抱歉…"

Asuka's face hardened and she put her phone down, as if she still had things to say. No, as if his last response gave her more things to say. Shinji was overwhelmed and annoyed at the same time by the sight. _I apologized, so why aren't you letting me get away with it? Everyone does. Everyone lets me off the hook after receiving an apology. That's what polite people do. Why do you hound me like a dog on the scent of blood, as if you have to make a killing blow?_  
明日香的脸色变得严肃，放下手机，仿佛还有话要说。不，仿佛他最后的回复给了她更多话要说。真嗣看到这一幕，既感到压力山大又觉得恼火。我道歉了，为什么你不放过我？大家都会的。大家收到道歉后都会放过我。这是有礼貌的人的做法。为什么你像闻到血腥味的狗一样追着我不放，仿佛非要给我致命一击？

Fortunately for him, Asuka changed the subject this time. "Do you feel anything before it happens? Like a sign, preceding the bigger one? Like, how people who often get sleep paralysis could actually predict it?"  
幸运的是，明日香这次换了话题。“在事情发生前，你有什么感觉吗？比如先兆，预示着更大的事件？就像经常经历睡眠瘫痪的人其实能预知它一样？”

Shinji nodded enthusiastically, thinking she indeed was a professional of sorts about these matters.  
真嗣热情地点头，心想她在这方面确实是个行家。

"I think I understand what you mean. There really is something."  
“我想我明白你的意思。确实有些什么。”

"What kind of something? Specifically."  
“具体是什么样的？详细说说。”

"It usually starts from my ears," Shinji frowned. "It gets muffled, like I'm in a long tunnel or on a bullet train. And I hear things, noises in the background, you know, like stuff you hear when you're underwater. After that, I start to feel pressure all over my body."  
"通常是从耳朵开始的，" 真嗣皱眉道，"声音变得沉闷，就像身处长长的隧道或是在高速列车上。然后我能听到背景里的杂音，你知道的，就像你在水下听到的那种。之后，我全身就开始感到压力。"

It suddenly became harder to breathe. The edges of his vision suddenly brightened, then blurred, while his ears started ringing. He closed his eyes, and when he opened them, he was sitting inside the entry plug while sitting on his hospital room bed at the same time. Whenever he took a deep breath, he felt the rough texture of his hospital gown and the rubbery pressure of the plugsuit. The air around him was cold and sterile and also boiling and unbreathable. And he was tightly holding the hand that wasn't Asuka's with the hand that wasn't his, while at the same time clutching the papery sheet of the hospital blanket.  
呼吸突然变得困难。视野边缘突然亮了起来，接着变得模糊，而他的耳朵开始嗡嗡作响。他闭上眼睛，再睁开时，发现自己同时坐在插入栓内和医院的病床上。每次深呼吸，他都能感受到病号服粗糙的质地和插入栓服橡胶般的压迫感。周围的空气既冷冽又带有消毒水的味道，同时又热得让人窒息。他紧紧握着那只不属于明日香的手，同时用那只不属于他的手紧抓着医院的薄被单。

And then, on his hand, he felt an alien warmth. It hesitated for a moment on the back of his hand, then penetrated his clenched fist, loosening it forcefully and seeping through the cracks between his fingers. Shinji clung to that warmth like a drowning man. After a while, the ringing in his ears stopped, and the stabbing pain around his eyes washed away too. He blinked a few times. Asuka was leaning toward him. Her face was about a hand's span away from his, its expression well guarded.  
然后，在他的手上，他感受到了一种异样的温暖。它在他手背上犹豫了一瞬，随即穿透了他紧握的拳头，强行松开了他的手指，渗入指缝之间。真嗣紧紧抓住那份温暖，如同溺水者抓住救命稻草。过了一会儿，他耳中的轰鸣停止了，眼周的刺痛也消退了。他眨了几次眼。明日香正向他倾身。她的脸距离他大约一手之隔，表情被严密地守护着。

"I told you to explain it, not recreate it. Are you an idiot?"  
“我让你解释，不是让你重现。你是傻瓜吗？”

"I'm sorry." "我很抱歉。"

Shinji sighed, lowering his head. What he saw made him freeze. He was holding Asuka's hand, fingers woven tightly together. He looked up, red-faced. Asuka was still expressionless. "If you have a problem with your senses, try covering them up with a similar sensation. That tends to help. Sometimes it doesn't, but still. In this case, I tried to replicate what your Unit did to Unit-02 back there."  
真嗣叹了口气，低下头。他看到的东西让他僵住了。他正握着明日香的手，手指紧紧交缠在一起。他涨红了脸抬头看去。明日香依旧面无表情。“如果你感官有问题，试着用相似的感觉覆盖它们。这通常会有帮助。有时也不尽然，但至少。在这种情况下，我试图模仿你的初号机对零二号机所做的。”

"Oh, okay." “哦，好的。”

"It's me who has to take the brunt of the damage if you can't do your part. Stop being pathetic and get a hold of yourself. This is the last time I'll ever take the trouble to babysit your ass."  
"如果你不能尽到你的责任，承受后果的可是我。别再自怨自艾了，振作起来。这是我最后一次费心照顾你这个麻烦。"

Feelings of disappointment and frustration suddenly came over Shinji. He nodded with a drying throat.  
失望和沮丧的情绪突然涌上真嗣的心头。他喉咙干涩地点了点头。

"Let me go now," Asuka said.  
"让我走吧，"明日香说道。"

Shinji realized that he'd been squeezing her hand for all this time. Shinji relaxed his grip. Her fingers slipped gently from his.  
真嗣意识到自己一直紧握着她的手。真嗣放松了握力。她的手指轻轻地从他的手中滑落。

It could've been simple inertia. The instinct to not let go of something that he was holding on to as if his life depended on it just moments ago. Or perhaps he just liked the warmth of it. Whatever the reason was, his hand shot out impulsively, unconsciously, and grabbed Asuka's receding one. He felt his heart sink the moment he realized what he had done. He cursed his hand for moving without asking his brain first. Asuka seemed equally shocked, so much so she didn't even get angry. She just stared at Shinji with a slightly opened mouth. His eyes were drawn to the little wrinkles on her pink lips, and only then did he realize that the distance between them was still uncomfortably close.  
这可能只是简单的惯性。刚才他紧握着某样东西，仿佛生命依赖于此，不愿放手的本能。或者也许他只是喜欢那种温暖。无论原因是什么，他的手不自觉地、冲动地伸出去，抓住了渐行渐远的明日香的手。他意识到自己做了什么的那一刻，心沉了下去。他咒骂自己的手未经大脑允许就擅自行动。明日香似乎同样震惊，以至于她甚至没有生气。她只是微微张着嘴盯着真嗣。他的目光被她粉红色嘴唇上的小皱纹吸引，直到那时他才意识到他们之间的距离仍然近得令人不安。

Shinji looked into Asuka's eyes and Asuka looked into his and the blue of them was all Shinji could see, bright and wide and endless. Something _strange,_ something icy but at the same time electric, flowed between the two of them. What was this feeling? Was this what it was like to actually connect with another person? He could see his reflection in her eyes, swimming up from their pelagic depths. It struck him then that perhaps to her there was no connection. That this strange thing between them was nothing but a vain, one-sided illusion his desperate mind had conjured up, and Asuka wasn't pulling away because she was just so shocked that Idiot Shinji had the audacity to snatch her hand back after she told him to let go of it mere moments before. But neither of them moved, and the moment stretched and stretched until the hiss of the door opening shattered it.  
真嗣凝视着明日香的眼睛，明日香也回望着他，那双湛蓝的眼眸占据了真嗣的全部视野，明亮、深邃且无边无际。一种奇异的感觉，既冰冷又充满电流般的力量，在他们之间流淌。这是什么感觉？难道这就是与他人真正产生联系的感觉吗？他能在她的眼中看到自己的倒影，从那深海般的深处浮现。那一刻，他突然意识到，或许对她来说，这根本不是什么联系。这种在他们之间产生的奇异感觉，可能只是他绝望心灵所编织出的虚幻一厢情愿，而明日香没有挣脱，仅仅是因为她太过震惊，这个笨蛋真嗣竟敢在她刚刚命令放手后，又大胆地握住她的手。但两人都没有动，这一刻被无限拉长，直到门开启的嘶嘶声将其打破。

Two heads turned towards the entrance at the same time with breakneck speed. Ms. Misato, in her usual red jacket, took a step inside with a bright smile, a smile that would freeze at the sight of the two pilots in front of her. Asuka quickly pulled her hand from Shinji's and straightened up, but it was too late. Ms. Misato opened her mouth to say…  
两个脑袋以惊人的速度同时转向入口。美里小姐一如既往地穿着她的红色夹克，带着灿烂的笑容迈步进来，然而这笑容在看到面前的两位驾驶员时定格了。明日香迅速从真嗣手中抽回自己的手，挺直了身子，但为时已晚。美里小姐张开嘴，正要说……

"Hey, Shin-man! Wake up! Recess! Lunchtime!"  
“嘿，真嗣！醒醒！休息时间！午饭时间到了！”

"Ah…"

Shinji opened his eyes. The smell of the classroom rushed into his nostrils. His hands rose reflexively and rubbed the sticky saliva around his mouth away. Toji was standing in front of his desk, the classroom bustling in the background. Some passing boys gave him indifferent eyes while moving to their respective lunch spots. Toji folded his arms.  
真嗣睁开了眼睛。教室的气味猛地涌入他的鼻腔。他的双手本能地抬起，擦去了嘴边黏糊的口水。剑介站在他的课桌前，教室里一片喧闹。几个路过的男生漠然地瞥了他一眼，然后各自走向午餐地点。剑介抱起双臂。

"You really are sick, huh? Sleeping through all four of our morning classes, heh?"  
“你真是病得不轻啊，嗯？连睡了我们上午的四节课，呵？”

Shinji nodded without a word. He couldn't reveal too many details of the operation (Ms. Misato warned him yesterday), so he just told them he had been sick when he reached his desk in the morning. And that was his last memory. Everything after that was dark. He might as well have time traveled from morning to noon. He groaned and stretched, looking around. Ayanami was staring at him from her window seat. Did he say hello to her today? It was the first time he saw her after Asuka kicked her out of his room last week. He nodded to her. Ayanami stared at him for about five seconds past what would normally be considered polite before turning her head away again, Shinji's greeting left unanswered. It was strangely funny, so Shinji chuckled a bit while turning his gaze away. He instantly found Asuka's eyes, looking sideways at him from her current position in the Class Rep's seat at the front of the room. Unlike Ayanami, Asuka immediately turned her eyes away casually and resumed her chat with the Class Rep.  
碇真嗣默默地点了点头。他不能透露太多行动细节（昨天美里小姐警告过他），所以他只是告诉他们，早上到课桌前时自己生病了，那是他最后的记忆。之后的一切都是一片黑暗。他仿佛从早晨穿越到了中午。他呻吟着伸展身体，环顾四周。绫波零正从她的窗边座位上盯着他看。今天他向她打招呼了吗？这是自上周明日香把他赶出房间后他第一次见到她。他向她点了点头。绫波零盯着他看了大约五秒钟，这已经超出了通常认为的礼貌时间，然后再次转过头去，真嗣的问候没有得到回应。这有点奇怪地好笑，所以真嗣轻声笑了一下，同时移开了视线。他立刻发现了明日香的目光，从教室前排的班长座位上斜视着他。与绫波零不同，明日香立刻随意地移开了目光，继续与班长聊天。

She had been grumpy again since last night. He had no clue why. And he had no time to think about it either, because Toji tapped him on the shoulder. "You looking for Kensuke? He ran off soon as the bell rang, a business trip to Class D or something. Oh, hey, how about this? I need to buy some shit anyway, so you go and get him while I go down to the snack bar. The seats on the left side of the playground, as always. Cool?"  
她从昨晚开始又变得脾气暴躁了。他完全不知道原因。而且他也没时间去琢磨这个，因为东治拍了拍他的肩膀。“你在找真嗣吗？铃声一响他就跑出去了，好像是去 D 班办什么事。哦，对了，这样如何？我正好需要买点东西，你去找他，我去小卖部。老地方，操场左边的那排座位。行吗？”

_Eh, no, I'd rather stay indoors for lunch today, and how am I supposed to know where Class D is, and also how am I supposed to drag this body around?_ Shinji had tons of things to say, but Toji jogged away without giving him a chance to say any of them. Shinji sighed and stood up. Along his path leading to the front door was Horaki's seat, where Asuka was eating with her. She had her back turned towards him and didn't give him a glance, while Horaki smiled and nodded slightly to him. He glanced at the lunch box on the desk and saw that Asuka had already eaten more than half of the karaage he'd packed for her. He exited the classroom, feeling suddenly lighter.

He passed the blackboard on his way out, the kanji from last session still unerased. The sight reminded him of yesterday's business, his mind returning to it while his feet carried him in the direction of class D.  
他出门时经过黑板，上一节课的汉字还未来得及擦去。这一幕让他想起了昨天的事，思绪随之飘回，而脚步则带着他走向 D 班。

Shinji almost lost sleep on Saturday night, thinking Asuka would never want to see him again after that stunt he pulled. Her angry and almost violent departure that evening made him so worried. Turns out he worried for nothing, because the next morning she barged into his hospital room when he'd barely finished eating his Sunday breakfast and shoved a textbook in his face, saying she needed some help with those pesky kanjis. That's how they'd spent the last day of his hospital stay. Strangely enough, Ms. Misato only showed up in the evening to pick Shinji up, not peeking in once throughout the day. He asked Asuka where she was, if something happened at home, and Asuka had become instantly grumpy, just saying she was busy. That shut down all the other questions from him after that.  
周六晚上，真嗣几乎失眠，担心明日香再也不会想见他了，毕竟他那番举动实在过分。她当晚愤怒而近乎暴力的离去让他忧心忡忡。结果证明他的担忧纯属多余，因为第二天早上，他刚吃完周日早餐，明日香就闯进了他的病房，把一本教科书塞到他面前，说她需要帮忙解决那些棘手的汉字。就这样，他们在医院度过了最后一天。奇怪的是，美里小姐直到傍晚才出现来接真嗣，一整天都没露面。他问明日香她在哪里，家里是不是发生了什么事，明日香立刻变得不悦，只说她很忙。这让他之后的问题都咽了回去。

Of course, they didn't spend the whole day just studying. They spent time chatting about this and would steal some of his food, saying she was curious how it tasted. And throughout all that, Shinji behaved perfectly. His will was iron. Because the moment Asuka came to him again, he vowed he would not make the same mistake. He kept his eyes in respectful places, never allowing himself to slip, even when Asuka teasingly leaned into his shoulder, pretending to read something from the book in front of them. Or when he caught a glimpse of her pale flesh under her loose clothes again. When he had a phantom pain episode, Asuka held his hand again. That was probably the hardest moment, his fantasies running wild and arousal surging as he looked at their joined hands, mind hazy as the pain subsided,, but in the end he managed to control himself. He even pulled his hand out first, politely and with a calm 'thank you.'  
当然，他们并没有整天都在学习。他们会花时间闲聊，她还会偷吃他的食物，美其名曰好奇味道如何。而在这整个过程中，真嗣表现得无可挑剔。他的意志坚如钢铁。因为自从明日香再次靠近他那一刻起，他就发誓绝不再重蹈覆辙。他始终保持目光得体，绝不让自己有丝毫松懈，即便明日香调皮地靠在他肩上，假装从面前的书里读些什么，或是他再次瞥见她宽松衣物下苍白的肌肤。当他又一次感到幻痛发作时，明日香再次握住了他的手。那或许是最艰难的时刻，他的幻想肆意奔涌，欲望如潮水般涌来，他凝视着两人紧握的手，随着疼痛逐渐消退，思绪变得朦胧，但最终他还是成功地控制住了自己。他甚至先抽回了手，礼貌地道了声“谢谢”，神情平静。

And it wasn't as impossibly difficult as he initially thought. He had already made a decision about what he would do that night before going to sleep by the time Asuka showed up. All the side effects of Asuka's harmless teasing and her weird notions of personal space could be dealt with later, by himself in a closed room. That was the only right way to deal with such fantasies.  
事情并没有他最初想象的那么难以克服。在明日香出现之前，他就已经决定好了那晚睡觉前要做什么。明日香那些无伤大雅的戏弄和她对个人空间的奇怪观念所带来的副作用，都可以留待以后，在封闭的房间里独自处理。这才是应对这些幻想的唯一正确方式。

Armed with such relaxed certainty, he was sure that he avoided making any critical mistakes. He probably slipped up on small things constantly, things he wasn't even aware of, because Asuka's mood had gotten progressively worse as time went by. She didn't even look at him while receiving her bento from him this morning. But he still did his best and was proud of it. Anything else was just…  
带着这种轻松的确定感，他确信自己避免了任何关键性的错误。他可能一直在小事上出纰漏，那些他甚至没有意识到的事情，因为明日香的情绪随着时间的推移变得越来越糟。今天早上她从他那里接过便当时甚至都没有看他一眼。但他仍然尽力而为，并为此感到自豪。其他的一切都只是……

Shinji, deep in his reverie, didn't realize someone was coming up from the other side while turning around the corner. Both Shinji and the other person yelped as they collided. There was a metallic clank and the sound of papers falling. Shinji ended up falling on his rear and groaned. In front of him sprawled Kensuke Aida.  
真嗣沉浸在自己的沉思中，没有意识到有人在拐角处从另一边走来。两人相撞时都惊叫了一声。金属的碰撞声和纸张落地的声音响起。真嗣最终跌坐在地上，呻吟了一声。在他面前躺着的是相田剑介。

"Oh, hello, Kensuke." “哦，你好， Kensuke。”

Kensuke stiffened and absolute terror flashed through his eyes. While Shinji, bewildered by the reaction, blinked, Kensuke relaxed his shoulders and sighed. "Oh, it's you, Shinji. You scared me. Can you help me with this? Please?"  
Kensuke 身体一僵，眼中闪过绝对的恐惧。Shinji 被这反应弄得一头雾水，眨了眨眼，Kensuke 放松了肩膀，叹了口气。“哦，是你啊，Shinji。你吓到我了。你能帮我一下吗？拜托了？”

Shinji looked around the floor. In front of Kensuke, there was a small silvery metal case (probably something military, or at least marketed as such, he figured), with its lid opened. Some twenty or thirty small photographs were scattered everywhere around both boys. Kensuke was already kneeling on the floor and busily picking them up. Soon Shinji joined him, squatting awkwardly. It was pictures of women sunbathing in swimsuits, on some white sandy beach he'd never been to. Pictures you could easily find in any boring magazine.  
Shinji 环顾了一下地面。在 Kensuke 面前，有一个小巧的银色金属箱（他猜可能是军用的，或者至少是作为军用品销售的），箱盖是打开的。大约二三十张小照片散落在两个男孩周围。Kensuke 已经跪在地上，忙着把它们捡起来。很快，Shinji 也加入了，笨拙地蹲下。这些照片是女人们在白色沙滩上穿着泳衣晒太阳的场景，他从未去过那里。这些照片在任何无聊的杂志上都很容易找到。

… Could you? Shinji felt something was off by the sixth piece, so he took a closer look at the one he picked up. The woman didn't look like a swimsuit model or a porn star. And the quality of the image and angle it was taken at were too 'ordinary', far from professional quality. And more than anything…  
……你能吗？真嗣在看到第六张照片时感觉有些不对劲，于是他更仔细地端详起自己捡起的那一张。照片中的女子既不像泳装模特，也不像色情明星。而且图片的质量和拍摄角度都太过‘普通’，远非专业水准。更关键的是……

"Kensuke…these are kids." Shinji swallowed and lifted another photo from the floor. A girl, in a standard sukumizu, napping under a parasol. The focus was between her legs, so he couldn't make out the face well, but he was sure this was a girl from his class. What was her name, Yuko? "These are kids from our school."  
“健介……这些都是孩子。”真嗣咽了咽口水，从地上又拿起一张照片。一个穿着标准水手服的女孩，在遮阳伞下小憩。焦点在她双腿之间，所以他看不清脸，但他确信这是他班上的一个女生。她叫什么来着，优子？“这些都是我们学校的孩子。”

"Of course they're from our school." Kensuke muttered, like it was nothing. He took the photos from Shinji, gathering them neatly in one hand and picking up the ones on the floor with the other. Shinji reached out and picked up another photo. His face flushed instantly, his mouth falling open. This one was much worse.  
“当然是我们学校的。”健介嘟囔着，仿佛这无关紧要。他从真嗣手中接过照片，一手整齐地收拢，另一手捡起地上的那些。真嗣伸手又拿起一张照片。他的脸瞬间涨红，嘴巴张开。这张照片更加糟糕。

"Is this a shower booth? How did you even take this?"  
“这是淋浴间吗？你怎么拍到的？”

Kensuke pushed up his glasses with his thumb, the noon sun flashing on them. His grinning teeth below were no less flashy. "Trade secret. Those are part of the separate set for VIP customers only. It's expensive to be a military otaku, you know. Have to make money from somewhere."  
“商业机密。那是专供 VIP 客户的独立套系。你知道的，当个军事宅很烧钱，总得从别处赚点回来。”

Shinji hesitated in the middle of reflexively placing the picture in Kensuke's outstretched hand. _Isn't this wrong?_ No, he was sure this was wrong. But…  
“碇真嗣在条件反射般地将照片放入伸出的手中途犹豫了。这样做不对吧？不，他确信这是错的。但是……”

With a small sigh, Shinji handed over the photo. He had to look away, for the eyes of an unnamed girl washing her naked body seemed to stare at him resentfully. Not like it was his business. He had no reason to say anything, especially to one of the few people he could call a friend. And that thought disgusted him. Shinji shook his head to rid himself of the rising guilt.  
伴随着一声轻叹，真嗣递出了那张照片。他不得不移开视线，因为照片中那个不知名的女孩正在清洗自己赤裸的身体，她的眼神似乎带着怨恨地盯着他。这本不关他的事。他没有理由说什么，尤其是对那些为数不多的、他能称之为朋友的人。而这种想法让他感到恶心。真嗣摇了摇头，试图摆脱那不断涌起的内疚感。

"Do guys actually pay for this? Do you sell a lot of them?"  
“男生真的会为此付钱吗？你卖得多吗？”

Kensuke collected the last few pictures that were left on the floor, giggling. "Not as many as I'd like. Actually, this delivery was for the fourth customer who bought this set. I think my potential buyers are all still satisfied with the last one. It was a real bestseller! Maybe I should be more strategic next time. I should put a longer gap between new releases."  
“没有我想象中那么多。实际上，这次送货是为第四个购买这套照片的顾客准备的。我觉得我的潜在买家们对上一套还挺满意的。那可是个真正的畅销品！也许下次我该更有策略些。我应该在新品发布之间留出更长的间隔。”

Shinji shook his head and tried to get up, but Kensuke snatched his wrist and sat him down. Everything went black for a moment, and Shinji had to put both hands on the floor to steady himself against a sudden onslaught of dizziness.  
真嗣摇了摇头，试图站起来，但健介一把抓住他的手腕，让他坐了回去。一切突然变得漆黑一片，真嗣不得不双手撑地，稳住自己，以抵御突如其来的眩晕感。

"Oh, I'm sorry. Really sorry. You're still sick, right? Father said something went wrong with the last operation. I should've remembered." Kensuke leaned in and whispered in Shinji's ear. "But we're short on time, so let me get straight to the point. Will you become my business partner?"  
“哦，对不起。真的很抱歉。你还在生病，对吧？父亲说上次手术出了点问题。我应该记得的。”健介凑近，在真嗣耳边低语，“但我们时间紧迫，所以我就直说了。你愿意成为我的商业伙伴吗？”

Shinji had no idea what this meant, maybe because his brain wasn't functioning normally yet. "What business? This? Taking creepshots?"  
真嗣完全不明白这是什么意思，也许是因为他的大脑还没有恢复正常运作。“什么生意？这个？偷拍吗？”

Kensuke happily nodded. "Yeah, there's something only you can do for me."  
健介开心地点头。“嗯，有件事只有你能帮我。”

Shinji sat on his hips. It was hard to keep squatting anymore.  
真嗣坐在他的臀部上。再蹲下去已经很难保持平衡了。

"I'm not interested." “我没兴趣。”

Kensuke followed him on his knees. "Oh, come on. I have a brilliant idea, an item that would totally replace the last bestseller, but your help is crucial for that."  
健介跟着他跪了下来。“哦，拜托。我有个绝妙的主意，一个能完全取代上一本畅销书的东西，但你的帮助至关重要。”

Shinji tried to use his head. Kensuke's whole attitude was clearly hinting at one certain question, and the boy was not in the mood to give up unless Shinji accommodated him to some degree. So Shinji sighed, exasperated.  
真嗣试图动脑筋。健介的整个态度明显在暗示某个特定问题，而男孩显然不打算放弃，除非真嗣在某种程度上满足他。于是真嗣叹了口气，感到无奈。

"All right, what's that last bestseller you keep talking about? Is it somehow related to me?"  
“好吧，你一直在说的那本畅销书是什么？它和我有什么关系吗？”

The corner of Kensuke's mouth went up. It was the kind of face he made when Shinji or Toji gave up and finally asked him what the length of a certain type of gun meant in terms of its combat capacity. So Shinji prepared for another long-winded, endless explanation that branched out into a stupid amount of tangents. But instead, Kensuke shut his mouth and pulled something out of his pocket.  
Kensuke 的嘴角微微上扬。每当 Shinji 或 Toji 放弃挣扎，最终问他某种枪的长度在战斗能力上意味着什么时，他就会露出这种表情。于是 Shinji 准备好迎接另一番冗长、无休止的解释，这些解释会分支成大量愚蠢的离题内容。但出乎意料的是，Kensuke 闭上了嘴，从口袋里掏出了什么东西。

It was a metal container that looked exactly the same as the one that was lying quietly, lid closed, on the floor. There was no mark or writing on it either, so Shinji wondered how Kensuke distinguished between the two. He instantly forgot such banal questions the moment Kensuke opened its lid.  
这是一个金属容器，看起来和静静躺在地板上、盖子紧闭的那个一模一样。上面也没有任何标记或文字，所以 Shinji 好奇 Kensuke 是如何区分两者的。但当 Kensuke 打开盖子的那一刻，他立刻忘记了这些无关紧要的问题。

"Behold, the Asuka Langley Soryu Collection. Browse it at your pleasure."  
“看好了，这是 Asuka Langley Soryu 的收藏。尽情欣赏吧。”

Shinji licked his quickly drying lips, turning over the pictures in the container. The ones on the top didn't seem particularly problematic. A profile shot of her walking on the school playground, or drinking water from a water fountain. Smiling, with her friends. It still felt strangely unpleasant, but the real dread he felt was the prospect of…  
真嗣舔了舔迅速干涸的嘴唇，翻看着容器里的照片。最上面的那些似乎并不特别成问题。她在学校操场上行走的侧面照，或是从饮水机喝水时的照片。微笑着，和朋友们在一起。尽管这感觉仍然奇怪地令人不快，但他真正感到恐惧的是……

Shinji swallowed, but nothing went down his dry throat. His index finger trembled slightly as he passed the midpoint inf the photo stack. Asuka's tight bloomers, so zoomed in that they filled the whole frame. Girls, changing for PE class, and Asuka in the middle of them, in her panties and bra.  
真嗣咽了咽口水，但什么也没能咽下他干涩的喉咙。他的食指微微颤抖，翻过了照片堆的中点。明日香紧绷的运动短裤，被放大到占据了整个画面。女生们换上体育课服装，而明日香在她们中间，只穿着内裤和胸罩。

Kensuke shook the container slightly. "Everyone's darling, in a literal sense. I think at least 200 boys have fapped to this set at this point."  
健介轻轻摇了摇容器。"大家的心头好，字面意义上的。我想到目前为止至少有 200 个男生对着这组照片打过飞机了。"

"Two hundred…?" "两百…？"

Kensuke let out a theatrical sigh. "Of course, I sold less than that. If I sold that many I would've bought mil-spec night vision lenses already. They share, you know. Unauthorized reproduction and redistribution at its finest. Not respecting my copyrights, heh. It doesn't even show boobs but was over ten times more popular than my oh-so-ambitious new product, Okinawa Beach Shower Booth Special, where you can see literally everything. Power of the model, I guess. Remember that ice cream I bought you, the one you almost refused because it was too expensive? The real vanilla stuff, not the synthesized crap they make after Second Impact? I was generous that evening because I'd never sold so many. I'll bet at least a dozen kids came on her face that night. So, think about it. How much would those horny bastards pay for Asuka Langley Soryu Shower Supreme? Or Asuka Langley Soryu's Used Underwear Set? You told me you do all the laundry at home, right? Then you could, you know, sneak one or two every month, so we wouldn't have any problem on the supply side. Think of it as payment for putting up with that nasty personality. You always complain, maybe this is the chance to -"  
健介夸张地叹了口气。“当然，我卖得没那么多。要是能卖那么多，我早就买军规夜视镜头了。他们共享，你知道的。非法复制和再分配的典范。不尊重我的版权，呵呵。内容甚至没有露点，却比我的新作《冲绳海滩淋浴间特辑》受欢迎十倍以上，那里可是能看到一切的。大概是模特的魅力吧。记得我给你买的那支冰淇淋吗，你差点拒绝因为太贵了？真正的香草味，不是第二次冲击后他们合成的劣质货。那晚我很大方，因为我从未卖得那么多。我敢打赌那晚至少有十几个孩子对着她的脸射了。所以，想想看。那些色鬼会为明日香·兰格雷的淋浴至尊版付多少钱？或是明日香·兰格雷的二手内衣套装？你说过你在家负责洗衣服，对吧？那你就可以，你知道的，每个月偷偷拿一两件，这样我们在供应方面就不会有问题。就当是忍受她那糟糕性格的补偿。你总是抱怨，也许这是个机会——”

Objectively speaking, Kensuke wasn't that tactless. It was usually the opposite. That day, he was acting on the basis of several wrong assumptions, assumptions that he couldn't be entirely blamed for having. And he also thought Shinji's blank gaze was a sign of Shinji's fatigue, not something else. So he didn't realize what was going on at first when Shinji lunged at him, pushing him down and climbing on top of him. When Shinji's clenched fist contacted his cheekbone in a manner closer to that of an ape than that of a man, it was too late.  
客观来讲，健介并不算那么不识趣。通常情况下，他反而是个机灵的人。那天，他是基于几个错误的假设行事，而这些假设他也不能完全被责怪。他还以为真嗣那空洞的眼神是疲惫的表现，而非其他。所以当真嗣猛扑向他，将他推倒并骑在他身上时，他起初并未意识到发生了什么。直到真嗣紧握的拳头以近乎猿猴而非人类的方式击中他的颧骨，一切为时已晚。

Shinji breathed heavily. It was like waking up from a nightmare. He hung suspended in the moment, unable to remember what came before or since. His heartbeat was thudding in his eardrums as if it wanted to tear them apart. Above it all a girl's loud, shrill scream rang out, piercing the haze in his mind. Shinji looked down, feeling something wriggle between his legs. It was Kensuke, his nose bent at a strange angle and blood bubbling from his mouth. Terror seized Shinji, and then realization and memory came. Anger burned away his fear and he raised his fist again. A droplet of blood flew from his hand, drawing a crimson arc in the air. Doubt stayed his hand. It appeared he briefly lost his mind in his anger and hurt Kensuke. It was bad, but at least it wasn't his choice. But this realization meant that from now on, every action he took would be his choice. A conscious choice. And didn't he do enough? With a rapidly chilling heart, Shinji looked at Kensuke's face again. Kensuke was blubbering gibberish, his eyes unfocused and full of tears, not seeing Shinji. Someone was shouting for a teacher. He tried to turn his head, but even that simple action made his head feel like someone was splitting it open with an axe. His sight blacked out for a moment, to return seconds later, dimmer than before. His ears were ringing, and he was having trouble breathing, too. He looked down again at Kensuke with a groan. He probably did every single thing the doctor warned him not to do and then some. He should stop, for his own sake if nothing else.  
真嗣喘着粗气，仿佛从噩梦中惊醒。他悬停在那一刻，记不清之前或之后发生了什么。心跳如鼓，震得耳膜似要破裂。在这之上，一个女孩尖锐刺耳的尖叫声响起，穿透了他脑海中的迷雾。真嗣低头一看，感觉有什么东西在双腿间蠕动。是剑介，他的鼻子扭曲变形，嘴里冒出血泡。恐惧攫住了真嗣，随后是恍然大悟与记忆的回归。怒火驱散了他的恐惧，他再次举起拳头。一滴血从他手中飞出，在空中划出一道猩红的弧线。疑虑止住了他的动作。看来他在愤怒中短暂地失去了理智，误伤了剑介。这很糟糕，但至少不是他有意为之。然而，这一认识意味着从今往后，他所做的每一个动作都将是他的选择，一个有意识的选择。他做得还不够吗？真嗣的心迅速冷却，再次看向剑介的脸。剑介语无伦次地抽泣着，眼神涣散，满含泪水，并未看见真嗣。有人在呼喊老师。 他试图转过头，但即便这样简单的动作也让他感觉像是有人正用斧头劈开他的脑袋。视线一度黑了下去，几秒钟后才恢复，却比之前暗淡。他的耳朵嗡嗡作响，呼吸也变得困难。他再次低头看向健介，发出一声呻吟。他大概做了医生警告他不要做的每一件事，甚至更多。为了自己，他应该停下来。

He aimed for the glasses that were miraculously not broken until now, and punched them with all his might, a grin on his lips.  
他瞄准了那副奇迹般至今未碎的眼镜，用尽全力一拳打去，嘴角挂着一丝笑意。

### Chapter 6 I don't

He was staring at Wondergirl again.  
他又盯着神奇女孩看了。

In fact, what made her really angry was that little smile that he gave her right after their eyes met. So comfortable and natural. A pleasant laugh, so different from the nervous or even bitter ones he directed at Asuka all too often. She wondered what kind of secret things passed between them, the kinds of jokes that didn't even require words. Actually, she didn't even want to know, because knowing would do nothing but enrage her further. No need to pour oil on that fire when it was already burning hot. She just didn't want to pay attention to it anymore.  
事实上，真正让她恼火的是，两人目光交汇后他那抹小小的微笑。如此舒适自然，一声愉悦的轻笑，与他经常对明日香流露出的紧张甚至苦涩的笑容截然不同。她不禁揣测，他们之间流转着怎样的秘密，那些无需言语的笑话。其实，她连知道都不想，因为知晓只会让她更加愤怒。既然火势已旺，何必再添油加醋。她只是不想再理会这些了。

_I'm fighting a losing battle,_ she thought suddenly. She was giving too much compared to what she'd been given. And more infuriatingly, the other party wasn't even aware of that. The vague thought that had been tickling her mind since last evening surfaced again. The idea that she should get out of this mess before losing more. She didn't even want to think about precisely what kind of currency she was losing, but there definitely was a deficit. It wasn't becoming of a genius like her to cling to a lost cause. That was simply stupid. But giving up so meekly felt wrong, too. And when she thought about all those confusing signals she received over the past few days…  
我正在打一场注定失败的仗，她突然想到。她付出的远比得到的要多。更令人恼火的是，对方甚至没有意识到这一点。昨晚以来一直撩拨她心弦的那个模糊念头再次浮现。她应该在失去更多之前摆脱这个困境。她甚至不想去想自己到底在失去什么，但肯定是有亏空的。像她这样的天才，执着于一个败局是不合适的。那简直是愚蠢。但就这样轻易放弃也感觉不对。而且当她回想起过去几天收到的那些令人困惑的信号……

She must have been staring for too long. The boy turned his head towards her, perhaps because he felt her gaze. He slightly raised his eyebrows when he met Asuka's eyes, as if in surprise. Asuka narrowed her eyes and turned her head, lifting a forkful of rice to her mouth. _Give me a proper reason,_ she thought while chewing. _Any reason to hate you for sure. Or not hate you. What I really can't stand is the ambiguity._  
她一定是盯着他看了太久。男孩转过头来，也许是因为感受到了她的目光。当他与明日香对视时，微微挑了挑眉，似乎有些惊讶。明日香眯起眼睛，转过头去，举起一叉米饭送到嘴边。给我一个正当的理由，她边嚼边想。任何理由让我确定恨你。或者不恨你。我真正无法忍受的是这种模糊不清。

Only after putting a small piece of chicken in her mouth did Asuka realize Hikari had been quiet for a while. Asuka looked up to find her looking at her with a weird expression. Asuka calmly chewed and swallowed the chicken and raised her chin slightly. "What?"  
直到将一小块鸡肉放入口中，明日香才意识到光已经安静了好一阵子。她抬头一看，发现光正用一种奇怪的表情看着她。明日香平静地咀嚼并咽下鸡肉，微微抬起下巴。"怎么了？"

Hikari, very unlike her usual self, answered the question with a question. "Ikari made that today, didn't he?"  
光非常不像她平时的自己，用一个问题回答了问题。"碇今天做的，对吧？"

Asuka nodded, after a moment of dumbstruck silence. "Of course."  
明日香在片刻的哑然沉默后点了点头。"当然。"

"Didn't you just say he was hospitalized throughout the whole school trip week? The HR teacher said he was exempt from PE class and cleaning duties, too."  
"你刚才不是说他整个学校旅行周都在住院吗？人事老师还说他的体育课和清洁任务都免了。"

Asuka used her fork to lift some rice to her mouth and swallowed it, barely chewing it. "Not like he's dying, is he? And he says it's actually comfortable for him to do what he'd been doing. Inertia or something, I guess."  
明日香用叉子挑起一些米饭送到嘴里，几乎没怎么咀嚼就咽了下去。“又不是快死了，对吧？而且他说他做那些事其实挺舒服的。大概是什么惯性之类的吧。”

Hikari looked at Asuka with that weird face again for a moment, then raised her gaze slightly and nodded with a smile. Asuka tried to look around to see what was up, then noticed a familiar figure in her peripheral view. As soon as he passed by, Hikari leaned over slightly. Her chopsticks darted in and out of Asuka's lunchbox before she could stop them.  
光再次用那种奇怪的表情看了明日香一会儿，然后微微抬眼，微笑着点了点头。明日香试图环顾四周，看看发生了什么，然后注意到视野边缘有一个熟悉的身影。他一经过，光就微微倾身。她的筷子在明日香反应过来之前迅速伸进她的午餐盒里。

"Hey!" Asuka protested. Hikari popped the piece of stolen chicken in her mouth and chewed thoughtfully before swallowing it.  
"嘿！" 明日香抗议道。光子将偷来的那块鸡肉塞进嘴里，若有所思地咀嚼后咽了下去。

"Mmmm, frozen karaage," she said. "Not too fancy. But it doesn't taste like the microwaved kind. Doesn't feel like it went to a fridge after being fried, am I right?"  
"嗯，冷冻的唐揚げ，" 她说道，"不算太精致。但不像微波炉加热的那种。感觉不像炸完又进了冰箱，对吧？

"… I guess?" Asuka was usually greeted in the mornings by the smell of his cooking. It was like a routine in her new home at this point. Today was no exception. She didn't even check today because she couldn't bear to look at him, but she was pretty sure this chicken was fried this morning, not yesterday.  
"……大概吧？" 明日香通常在早晨会被他做饭的香味迎接。这已成为她在新家的日常。今天也不例外。她甚至没去确认，因为不忍直视他，但她很确定这鸡肉是今早炸的，不是昨天。

Hikari was wearing that face again. Asuka briefly wondered why that expression looked so familiar, and frowned when she realized it was the exact same one she saw from Misato last weekend. "Why are you looking at me like that?"  
光又露出了那种表情。明日香短暂地疑惑为什么这个表情看起来如此熟悉，当她意识到这正是上周末在美里脸上看到的那副表情时，她皱起了眉头。“你为什么那样看着我？”

At least Hikari had the decency to blush, unlike Misato. Still, it did nothing to lessen Asuka's irritation. She was aware that maybe she felt that way because she was projecting her frustration against Misato on the innocent Hikari, but that still did not put her at ease.  
至少光还有点羞耻心，会脸红，不像美里。然而，这丝毫没有减轻明日香的烦躁。她知道或许自己是因为把对美里的不满投射到了无辜的光身上，但即便如此，她依然无法平静下来。

"Nothing. I'm just, well, it's pretty obvious that you've never cooked before."  
“没什么。我只是，呃，很明显你以前从没下过厨。”

Asuka put her fork down on the lunch box. A dull sound rang as the iron met plastic. "What are you talking about?"  
明日香将叉子放在便当盒上。铁器与塑料碰撞，发出沉闷的声响。“你在说什么呢？”

Hikari avoided Asuka's eyes, picking up something from her own lunch box. "Just, you know, maybe Ikari is much much more diligent than me, but… I wouldn't cook something that requires that much oil in the morning solely out of pure inertia."  
光回避了明日香的目光，从自己的便当盒里捡起一样东西。“就是，你知道的，也许碇同学比我勤奋得多，但是……我可不会仅仅因为惯性就在早上做需要那么多油的菜。”

Asuka took the fork and for a moment thought about the things Hikari's words implied. It was true that this was a new, previously never considered angle, but fundamentally it was no different from the vain hopes and expectations that led Asuka to be disappointed time and time again since the last operation. Asuka shook her head with a sullen face. She didn't want to repeat the same mistake in such a short span of time. "Dunno."  
明日香拿起叉子，一时间思考着光的话语所暗示的事情。确实，这是一个之前从未考虑过的新角度，但本质上与那些徒劳的希望和期待并无不同，这些期待曾一次次让明日香在最后一次行动后失望。明日香阴沉着脸摇了摇头。她不想在这么短的时间内重蹈覆辙。“不知道。”

Hikari looked around and leaned her body forward. Even before her carefully lowered voice came out, Asuka knew what she was about to say, but still she couldn't completely stop herself from blushing. "Asuka, does Ikari… does he…"  
光环顾四周，身体微微前倾。即便她那小心翼翼压低的声音还未出口，明日香已经猜到她要说什么，但仍无法完全抑制住脸红。“明日香，碇……他……”

"No!" She gritted her teeth and lowered her voice, feeling curious eyes. "You say that because you don't know him, Hikari. He's just an idiot, so stupid," Asuka bit her lip, realizing her reaction was a bit overboard. "It's not a wonder he does things like that."  
“不！”她咬紧牙关，压低声音，感受到好奇的目光。“你这么说是因为你不了解他，光。他只是个白痴，蠢得要命，”明日香咬着嘴唇，意识到自己的反应有些过激。“他会做出那种事也不奇怪。”

Fortunately for Asuka, Hikari didn't prod more. She still had that unpleasant smile, the smile that was saying _I-know-everything_, but at least she was still more respectful than Asuka's so-called guardian.  
幸运的是，光没有再追问下去。她依旧挂着那令人不快的笑容，仿佛一切尽在掌握，但至少她比明日香所谓的监护人要更懂得尊重。

After that a brief silence fell, followed by some small talk. Neither of them spoke a word about a certain pilot. Not like he was a regular subject between the two anyway. And both Hikari and Asuka didn't pay much mind when a ruckus was raised in the hallway, loud enough to mask the noise from the playground. Asuka wasn't much interested even when the front door of the classroom opened and a girl from some other class came in straight to Hikari, whispering to her with a deadly serious face. _Must be some administrative work from the teacher's office,_ Asuka thought. It only became a bit weird when she realized the girl was constantly glancing at her.  
随后是一阵短暂的沉默，接着是一些闲聊。他们俩都没有提及某个飞行员。毕竟，这也不是他们之间的常规话题。当走廊里响起足以掩盖操场噪音的喧闹声时，无论是光还是明日香都没有太在意。即使教室前门被打开，另一个班级的女生直接走到光面前，一脸严肃地对她耳语，明日香也并不怎么感兴趣。她以为这不过是老师办公室的行政事务。直到她注意到那个女生不停地瞟向她，事情才显得有些奇怪。

"What's the hurry? It's still recess, you know." Asuka asked absently, after the girl left and Hikari started to quickly close her lunch box.  
“急什么？还没下课呢。”明日香心不在焉地问道，那女生离开后，光迅速合上了她的午餐盒。

"I don't know, the homeroom teacher is calling from the office. Must be very urgent. I'll be right back."  
“不知道，班主任从办公室打来的电话。一定很紧急。我马上回来。”

It was only after seeing an ambulance and a police car pulling right up to the school campus that Asuka realized that something big happened, and it was probably related to the call Hikari received. Soon the bell rang, announcing the end of lunchtime, and Hikari came back to the classroom. She beckoned to Asuka without a word, heading to Shinji's seat, and only then did Asuka realize that Shinji was nowhere to be seen.  
直到看见一辆救护车和一辆警车直接开进学校校园，明日香才意识到发生了大事，很可能与光希接到的那个电话有关。不久，铃声响起，宣告午休结束，光希回到了教室。她一言不发地向明日香招手，走向真嗣的座位，这时明日香才意识到真嗣不见了。

---

"Let the school handle it as much as possible. It's not a good look to intervene too much in civil matters. Go in only if they try to involve the police or any other civilian organizations. If you guys showed up the moment it happened it'd be one thing, but it's too late now."  
“尽量让学校处理这件事。过多介入民事事务并不好看。只有在他们试图牵扯警方或其他民间组织时才介入。如果你们当时就出现，那还另当别论，但现在为时已晚。”

The voice on the phone was calm, with an undercurrent of frustration. Misato didn't like the answer it gave her. Well, she didn't like the whole situation from the start. Barging into Ritsuko's office because of this mess was definitely not part of her lunch plans.  
电话那头的声音平静，却暗含着一丝不悦。美里对这个回答并不满意。其实，她从一开始就不喜欢整个局面。因为这团乱麻而闯进律子的办公室，绝对不在她的午餐计划之内。

"I'm not blaming you for the fight itself, am I? Yeah, the minimum-contact policy was my idea from the start. So what? I'm not saying you should've been there to stop the punch or something. Are you trying to imply something? No? Good. I'm just saying your teams were too late to react after the deed. No, just shut up. I'm not accepting excuses. Call me only if there's any change."  
"我并没有怪你挑起争端，对吧？是的，最小接触政策从一开始就是我的主意。那又怎样？我并不是说你应该在场阻止那一拳什么的。你是想暗示什么吗？没有？很好。我只是说你的团队在事情发生后反应太迟了。不，闭嘴。我不接受借口。有任何变化再给我打电话。"

Misato pressed the call end button. If it was a landline, not a cell phone, she would've slammed the receiver down. "Incompetent good-for-nothing loudmouths, all of them."  
美里按下了结束通话键。如果是座机而不是手机，她可能会把听筒摔下去。“一群无能的废物，吵吵嚷嚷的。”

"I heard the whole department is brimming with discontent. They think they're being given an impossible task, protecting the assets while still forced to let them roam free among the general public."  
"我听说整个部门都充满了不满。他们认为被赋予了一项不可能完成的任务，既要保护资产，又被迫让他们在公众中自由活动。"

Ritsuko said all of that without taking her eyes off the monitor. Misato couldn't see what was on the screen from this angle, but she knew it was something about Unit-03 that was being built in the United States, some kind of advisory letter. Misato, sitting across from Ritsuko, looked at the cat figurines on the desk, and finally turned her eyes to the coffee mug in front of her. "I gotta come up with some disciplinary measures."  
律子说完这一切，眼睛始终没有离开过显示器。美里从这个角度看不到屏幕上的内容，但她知道那是关于在美国建造的 03 号机的一些咨询文件。美里坐在律子对面，目光扫过桌上的猫咪摆件，最后转向自己面前的咖啡杯。“我得想些纪律措施。”

Ritsuko started tapping on the keyboard. "Are you planning to start an interdepartmental war against Section 2?"  
律子开始敲击键盘。“你打算对第二部门发动跨部门战争吗？”

"No, I'm talking about Shinji."  
“不，我说的是真嗣。”

The tapping sound stopped for a while, and continued again. "And I thought you were overprotective of him. You were all over him last week."  
那敲击声停了一会儿，又继续响起。“我还以为你对他过度保护了呢。上周你可是寸步不离地守着他。”

"This situation is different."  
“这种情况不一样。”

Ritsuko's gaze turned to her for the first time in minutes and then returned to the monitor. She kept her mouth closed, but for some reason Misato felt the urge to keep talking.  
几分钟来，赤木律子第一次将目光转向她，随后又回到了显示器上。她紧闭着嘴，但不知为何，美里感到一股继续说话的冲动。

"Getting hospitalized because of an injury sustained in an operation is totally different from picking a fight against a civilian. The former deserves all the kindness and care. The latter is an unacceptable character flaw."  
因执行任务受伤而住院与与平民斗殴截然不同。前者理应得到所有的善意与关怀。后者则是一种不可接受的品行缺陷。

One corner of Ritsuko's lips went up slightly. "Maybe he's still wounded. Psychological trauma, you know. Maybe you should take as much care of him now as you did last week."  
赤木律子嘴角微微上扬。"或许他仍有创伤。心理上的，你知道的。或许你现在应该像上周那样悉心照顾他。"

Misato snorted. "Now you sound like one of those charlatans."  
美里哼了一声。"现在你听起来像个江湖骗子。"

Ritsuko raised her eyebrows as if she was interested. "A charlatan?"  
律子挑了挑眉，似乎对此颇感兴趣。“江湖骗子？”

"Yeah, a charlatan. Those scammers who tell you to draw something on paper and make up nice stories about them just to give you some pills that do nothing but make you sleepy."  
“是啊，江湖骗子。那些骗子让你在纸上画些东西，然后编造些动听的故事，目的只是为了给你一些除了让你犯困外毫无用处的药丸。”

"Psychological trauma is a legitimate form of trauma, too. And I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that Shinji has accumulated such trauma, considering all the erratic behaviors he's displayed so far."  
“心理创伤也是一种合法的创伤形式。考虑到真嗣至今表现出的种种异常行为，我认为假设他积累了这样的创伤并不为过。”

Misato crossed her legs. Both women knew what Ritsuko was intentionally omitting, but it was a big mistake if she thought she was winning because of what she was loudly implying. "I'm not saying there's no such thing as psychological trauma. I'm saying that it's unrealistic to think that you're absolved of responsibility for your own actions because of it, or that it's the responsibility of others to do something about it."  
美里交叉着双腿。两位女士都明白律子有意省略的内容，但如果她以为自己因为大声暗示的东西而占了上风，那可就大错特错了。“我不是说心理创伤不存在。我是说，认为因为心理创伤就可以免除对自己行为的责任，或者认为这是他人应负责解决的问题，这种想法是不现实的。”

Ritsuko's hands stopped, then tapped the keyboard again. This time, the pause was a little longer than the last time. Her eyes remained fixed on the monitor.  
律子的手停了下来，然后再次敲击键盘。这一次，停顿的时间比上次稍长。她的目光依旧固定在显示器上。

"You're denying the hard-won achievements of both the academic part of the field of psychiatry and society's perception of it in recent years."  
“你是在否定精神病学领域学术部分以及近年来社会对其认知所取得的来之不易的成就。”

Misato laughed again and looked away. The Geofront meadow out the window looked quite pretty. It was something she couldn't see from her underground office. "It's a collaboration of weak-minded pushovers and scammers who get rich off them. You remember Second Impact. The Tokyo Incident. And all the misery after that. Did we have counselors and therapists back then?"  
律子笑了笑，转过头去。窗外地底前庭的草地看起来相当美丽。这是她从地下办公室无法看到的景象。“这是一群意志薄弱的软弱者和骗子的合作，他们靠这些人发财。你还记得第二次冲击吗？东京事件。以及那之后的所有苦难。那时候我们有辅导员和治疗师吗？”

Ritsuko smiled. "No, we didn't."  
律子微笑道：“没有，我们没有。”

"Precisely. But civilization has been restored, and society is functioning."  
“正是如此。但文明已经恢复，社会也在正常运作。”

"Is it?" "是吗？"

Misato frowned. "And, objectively, I don't think Shinji's situation is so serious to the point that I have to turn a blind eye to his actions. I can't allow this from him, nor should I tolerate it. What we're asking of him isn't light, I know that, and I'm always sorry for that, but he isn't meeting the standard when it comes to mental fortitude. As his commanding officer, I think I can demand more from him than this. He should be more like Asuka, I think. She's much better about this kind of thing. I really hope some parts of her rub off on him."  
美里皱起眉头。“而且，客观来说，我认为真嗣的情况还没严重到我必须对他的行为视而不见的地步。我不能允许他这样，也不应该容忍。我们对他要求不轻，我知道，对此我总是感到抱歉，但他在心理坚韧方面确实没有达到标准。作为他的指挥官，我认为我可以对他有更高的期望。我觉得他应该更像明日香，她在这方面做得好多了。我真的希望她的一些优点能影响到他。”

Ritsuko didn't respond, so the conversation ended there. The heavy silence ended shortly afterward with Ritsuko tapping the keyboard a single time, cheerfully. "Done. Let's eat before the cafeteria closes."  
律子没有回应，于是对话就此结束。不久后，律子愉快地敲了一下键盘，打破了沉重的沉默。“好了，完成。我们快去吃饭吧，不然食堂要关门了。”

---

The bags in her hand felt heavy. The weight of them became a little overwhelming ever since she decided to hold her and Shinji's bags in one hand. But Asuka was unable to open the door of the nurse's office in front of her with the other.  
她手中的袋子感觉沉重。自从她决定用一只手同时提着她和真嗣的袋子后，这份重量就变得有些难以承受。但明日香无法用另一只手打开面前的护士办公室门。

As soon as Hikari entered the classroom, she beckoned to Asuka and immediately headed to Shinji's seat. The teacher was calmly conducting class as if he couldn't see Hikari and Asuka, while the whole class was looking at them, whispering. Hikari packed Shinji's bag without a word and left the classroom. For some reason she could not explain to herself, Asuka hurriedly packed her bag before following Hikari.  
光一进教室，就向明日香招手，随即直奔真嗣的座位。老师平静地继续上课，仿佛看不见光和明日香，而全班同学都在看着她们，窃窃私语。光一言不发地收拾好真嗣的书包，离开了教室。不知为何，明日香无法向自己解释，急忙收拾好自己的书包，跟着光离开。

It was only halfway to the nurse's office that Asuka heard the whole story, or at least the part that Hikari knew.  
直到走到护士办公室半路，明日香才听完了整个故事，或者说至少是光所知道的部分。

Then Hikari had to go back, leaving Asuka stranded in front of the nurse's office.  
然后光子不得不回去，留下明日香孤零零地站在护士办公室前。

She already forgot where and how seriously that worm (she could never remember his name) was injured. The only thing she remembered was that he was taken to the ER. None of the reasons for that violence save one felt that important, at least for now. . To be honest, she wasn't even very interested in the fact that Shinji collapsed due to hyperventilation. Not like he was dying anyway.  
她已经记不清那个虫子（她总是记不住他的名字）在哪里受了多重的伤。她唯一记得的是他被送进了急诊室。除了一个原因外，其他所有导致这场暴力的理由现在看来都不那么重要。老实说，她对真嗣因过度换气而昏倒的事实也没多大兴趣。反正他又不会死。

What filled Asuka's mind now was a realization that could easily be a delusion, and an intense debate on what to do after entering the room in each possible scenario her brain presented her.  
此刻充斥在明日香脑海中的，是一个可能轻易成为错觉的领悟，以及对进入房间后在每一种可能情景下该如何行动的激烈辩论。

And she was well aware that her mind was already leaning toward one certain scenario, which meant that the only thing stopping her hand from opening the door was the fear that she was going to repeat the same mistake she'd been making for the past few days, blinded by empty hope yet again.  
她很清楚自己的心思已经倾向于某个特定的情境，这意味着唯一阻止她推开门的原因，是她害怕自己会再次重蹈覆辙，被空洞的希望蒙蔽双眼，就像过去几天一直在犯的错误那样。

The realization that it was fear that was stopping her finally moved her hand. Fear was shameful and thus unacceptable.  
意识到是恐惧在阻止她，她的手终于动了。恐惧是可耻的，因此是不可接受的。

Asuka roughly opened the door of the nurse's office to find three heads turning to her at the same time. Asuka looked them over swiftly. Nearest to the door was the school nurse with a fed-up look on her face. Two rows of curtained beds, and a straight-faced middle-aged police officer standing at the far end of them. Next to him was an occupied bed, the boy sitting on it, his back resting on the headboard. A paper bag was thrown on his knees. He averted his gaze the moment he realized it was Asuka who barged into the place.  
明日香粗鲁地推开医务室的门，发现三个人同时转向她。明日香迅速扫视了一圈。离门最近的是一脸不耐烦的校医。两排挂着帘子的床，以及站在它们尽头的面无表情的警官。他旁边是一张有人躺着的床，男孩坐在上面，背靠在床头板上。一个纸袋扔在他的膝盖上。他一意识到是明日香闯进来，就立刻移开了目光。

First to speak was the police.  
首先开口的是警察。

"Authorized persons on…" He blurred the words, narrowing his eyes. Asuka's general attitude and her foreign look must have raised suspicions.  
"授权人员在……" 他含糊其辞，眯起了眼睛。明日香的一般态度和她外国人的外貌肯定引起了怀疑。

Asuka pointed at the door with her chin. "Leave us. NERV business."  
明日香用下巴指了指门。"离开我们。NERV 事务。"

The nurse bustled out immediately, as if she had been waiting for those exact words. The policeman wasn't so cooperative, folding his arms and not moving a step. "I can't leave the suspect. I don't care about this 'NERV business' either. You can do it right in front of me or do it another time."  
护士立刻匆匆离去，仿佛一直在等待这些话。警察则不那么配合，双臂交叉，一步也不动。“我不能离开嫌疑人。我也不在乎这个‘NERV 事务’。你可以在我面前做，或者换个时间。”

Asuka felt both contempt and anger at the petty little defiance of this petty little man, but did not let it show on her face. There were ways to deal with peasants without losing one's dignity.  
对于这个卑微小人那点微不足道的反抗，明日香既感到鄙视又感到愤怒，但她没有让这些情绪显露在脸上。对付乡巴佬，有的是不失尊严的方法。

"Really? Then you'll hear some sensitive information, including the Evangelion pilots' routes and everything, which, honestly, I don't care if you hear or not. But my security guards will! To them those things are classified secrets. I don't care if you know where I'm going or what I'm doing all day, but I'm not the one who'll be forced to sign five or six NDAs before the end of the day and then be the reason every single person in my extended family has to get a background check done by the end of this month. They probably wouldn't be too happy with you about that!"  
“真的吗？那你将会听到一些敏感信息，包括福音战士驾驶员的路线等等，说实话，我不在乎你是否听到。但我的保安们会在意！对他们来说，那些都是机密。我不在乎你是否知道我要去哪儿或整天在做什么，但我不是那个要在今天结束前被迫签署五六份保密协议，然后成为让我的所有远亲在本月底前都要接受背景调查的人。他们可能不会对你太满意！”

He must have been more reasonable than he looked, because he left the room without a single additional word. Asuka didn't even spare a glance his way.  
他一定比外表看起来更理智，因为他一句话也没多说就离开了房间。明日香甚至没有瞥他一眼。

Her eyes were fixed on the bed. Its occupant didn't return her gaze, and that, more than the policeman's little stunt, made her angry, almost unreasonably so. Suspicions she had forced down returned to gnaw at her mind. She suddenly wanted to throw his bag at him, tell him that the school decided to send him home today, and just leave. But that would be too unnatural, if anything. There had to be a question, at the very least, regardless of its actual form.  
她的目光紧盯着床。床上的人没有回应她的凝视，这比警察的小把戏更让她生气，几乎到了无理取闹的地步。她强行压下的疑虑再次啃噬着她的心。她突然想把他的包扔给他，告诉他学校决定今天送他回家，然后就这么离开。但那样做太不自然了，至少得有个问题，不管它实际上是什么形式。

_No rush, Asuka,_ she thought to herself. _If he messes up again, it's his fault, not mine. But there's no reason for me to scare him._  
别急，明日香，她暗自想道。如果他再搞砸，那是他的错，不是我的。但我没有理由吓唬他。

"Who do you think you are?" she snapped out loud. "You think you're my guardian or something? Protecting my honor, huh? You think I need you for that?"  
"你以为你是谁？" 她大声呵斥道，"你以为你是我的守护者还是什么？保护我的名誉，嗯？你以为我需要你来做这些？"

Shinji's eyes, which had been fixed on the paper bag on his lap, turned to Asuka for the first time. Asuka trembled a little as she saw the burning resentment in them. It occurred to her that her mistake might have led her to unexpected success. A small voice from within whispered that she was deluding herself, that it was only natural to be angry after being treated like that and there was no other secret, hoped-for motivation or sentiment behind it, but Asuka simply ignored it.  
一直盯着腿上纸袋的 Shinji 终于第一次将目光转向 Asuka。Asuka 看到他眼中燃烧的怨恨，不禁微微颤抖。她突然意识到，自己的错误可能意外地带来了成功。内心有个小小的声音低语，她在自欺欺人，被那样对待后生气是理所当然的，背后并没有其他隐秘的、希望的动机或情感，但 Asuka 只是置之不理。

"It's, it's nothing like that."  
"根本不是那样的。"

Asuka wasn't too disappointed when the fire quickly disappeared from Shinji's eyes and that crawling voice came out from his lips. Rather, she expected it. That glimpse of fire she'd caught, that tiny piece of evidence of perhaps something more, excited her. She wanted to prod him for more, but she had to do it quickly. She struggled to appear nonchalant.  
当火焰迅速从真嗣眼中消失，取而代之的是那低沉的声音从他唇间爬出时，明日香并没有太过失望。相反，她早有预料。她捕捉到的那一抹火焰，那微小的、或许是更多的证据，让她感到兴奋。她想进一步挑逗他，但必须迅速行动。她努力装作若无其事。

"Then why? Why did you do that?"  
“那为什么？你为什么要那样做？”

_Why are you angry? Do you feel betrayed by me? Why?_ Those questions were left unspoken, mingling with the dust floating in the air beneath the noonday light coming through the windows.  
你为何生气？是否觉得被我背叛了？为什么？这些问题未曾说出口，与正午阳光透过窗户洒下的尘埃混杂在一起。

Shinji turned his face away sullenly. The motion failed to hide the faint flush on his face from Asuka's hyper-focused eyes. Asuka found herself standing right next to his bed, her feet already moving without her realizing it. Shinji's irregular breathing and her own heartbeat filled her ears, but she could still hear the gears turning busily behind Shinji's eyes.  
真嗣阴沉着脸转过头去。这个动作没能掩盖住他脸上因明日香那专注目光而泛起的淡淡红晕。明日香发现自己已经站在他的床边，双脚不由自主地移动着。真嗣不规律的呼吸和她自己的心跳声充斥着她的耳朵，但她仍能听到真嗣眼中忙碌转动的思绪。

Shinji's eyes narrowed, and Asuka's eyes followed suit. She was, despite herself, waiting on tenterhooks for his answer. _I'm not expecting too much. I'm not expecting something as dramatic as 'because I like you'. Anything, anything but some cowardly evasion like 'I don't know,'. Anything between those two extremes, I'm willing to accept. And if you manage that, I don't know, maybe I'll kiss you on the cheek. I'll say I never asked for your help but that I'm still obliged to reward you accordingly. Even that would penetrate that thick skull of yours, and this is a concession that I could tolerate as…_  
真嗣的眼睛眯了起来，明日香的眼睛也随之紧缩。尽管她不愿承认，但她确实紧张地等待着他的回答。我并没有期待过高。我并没有期待像‘因为我喜欢你’这样戏剧性的答案。任何答案，只要不是像‘我不知道’这样懦弱的逃避，我都能接受。在这两个极端之间的任何答案，我都愿意接受。如果你能做到这一点，我不知道，也许我会亲吻你的脸颊。我会说我从未要求你的帮助，但我仍然有义务相应地奖励你。即使那样，也能穿透你那厚厚的头骨，这是我能够容忍的让步……

"Sorry. I don't know. I really don't know why I did that."  
“对不起。我不知道。我真的不知道我为什么要那么做。”

Asuka was already beginning to lean towards him when he said those dreaded words in that crawling voice. Shinji blinked quickly at Asuka's too-near face. The warmth and fantasies that had filled Asuka's heart were swept away at once, and hatred filled the gaps they left. All she could think of was slapping him in the face, and she would have done it if her hand wasn't already grasping his school bag. Asuka opted instead to throw it at his face.  
当他说出那些令人畏惧的话语，声音低沉得令人不安时，明日香已经开始向他倾斜。真嗣迅速眨眼，面对着明日香过于靠近的脸庞。那些曾填满明日香心间的温暖与幻想瞬间被一扫而空，取而代之的是仇恨，填满了留下的空隙。她满脑子只想扇他一巴掌，要不是她的手已经抓住了他的书包，她早就这么做了。明日香选择了将书包扔向他。

Shinji yelped. "What the hell are you doing!"  
真嗣惊叫起来。“你到底在干什么！”

There was real anger in his voice, but Asuka had already turned around and marched halfway to the door at that point.  
他的声音中确实带着怒气，但那时明日香已经转身，大步走向门口，走了一半。

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

Asuka opened the door, ignoring the call. Two Section 2 agents, not quite able to hide their surprise behind their sunglasses, were standing right in front of her. One of them had his hand extended awkwardly, probably meaning to open the door right before she did it for him. The agents soon regained their composure and straightened up.  
明日香推开门，无视了那声呼唤。两名第二分部的特工，尽管努力在墨镜后掩饰，仍难掩惊讶之色，就站在她面前。其中一人尴尬地伸出手，大概是打算在她之前开门。特工们很快恢复了镇定，挺直了身子。

"Miss Soryu, by the order of Operation Manager Katsuragi -"  
“碇小姐，根据葛城作战部长的命令——”

Asuka shoved past him and headed for the corridor that led to the main gate. No one tried to stop her.  
明日香推开他，朝通往正门的长廊走去。没有人试图阻止她。

### Chapter 7 Parallel

Shinji's teeth chattered. The small meeting room in HQ where the Section 2 agents had left him was too cold. Way too cold. The place was probably set to standard room temperature, but even that felt unbearable to Shinji's exhausted body.  
真嗣的牙齿不住打颤。总部里第二课特工们留他待着的小会议室冷得刺骨。实在太冷了。这里大概调的是标准室温，但对精疲力尽的真嗣来说，连这都难以忍受。

So he trembled for half an hour by himself in the dark room, clutching his goosebumped arms. It felt more like three hours. He shuddered at the cold, but also at the betrayal.  
于是他独自一人在黑暗的房间里颤抖了半个小时，紧抱着自己起了鸡皮疙瘩的双臂。感觉更像是三个小时。他因寒冷而颤抖，也因背叛而战栗。

_By who?_ That was an easy question to answer. Asuka, Kensuke, and, as time went by, Misato. But most of it was Asuka, the other two names merely an afterthought.  
被谁？这个问题很容易回答。明日香、真嗣，还有随着时间流逝，美里。但大部分是明日香，另外两个名字不过是附带的。

_Why?_ That one wasn't that difficult either. Asuka shouldn't have done that to Shinji. He had no doubt that in this case, he had every right to be mad at her.  
为什么？这个问题也不难。明日香不应该那样对待真嗣。他毫不怀疑，在这种情况下，他完全有理由对她生气。

_What was she supposed to do?_ That question was the one that ended up short-circuiting his brain.  
她应该怎么做？这个问题最终让他大脑短路。

Objectively speaking, the question was not that difficult, just like the previous ones. An easily acceptable answer came to his mind instantly. That she shouldn't have acted that angrily towards Shinji for seemingly no reason, that she should've at least not thrown that bag at him. But he knew that there was more to it than that. He knew that he'd had a certain set of expectations, a certain hope, from the moment that Asuka burst through the door of the nurse's office and came to him. Or even before that. And that fact pushed him into a whirlpool of shame and self-hatred.  
客观来说，这个问题并不难，就像之前的那些一样。一个容易被接受的答案立刻浮现在他脑海中。她不应该无缘无故对真嗣发那么大的火，至少不应该把包扔向他。但他知道事情远不止如此。他知道从那一刻起，从明日香冲进医务室来到他身边的那一刻，甚至更早之前，他就抱有某种期待，某种希望。而这个事实将他卷入了一股羞愧与自我厌恶的漩涡。

Misato found Shinji in such a state, lost in misery and anger, when the automatic door whooshed open.  
当自动门呼啸打开时，美里发现真嗣正处于这种状态，沉浸在痛苦和愤怒之中。

She didn't enter the room, instead stopping just inside the doorway. From there she simply watched him. Shinji turned to her and then back to the desk, because he couldn't bear to look at her expressionless face anymore. An old resentment towards her, something he thought long forgotten and buried, flared up again, and it filled Shinji with disgust. He hated disappointing Misato. And he hated Misato for hanging unsolicited expectations on him and getting disappointed in him when he didn't meet them. And most of all, he hated himself for being such a spiteful little ingrate. The audacity of him. Shinji's actions today deserved some scolding, and he was already resenting her even before she opened her mouth. He had no right to do so.  
她没有走进房间，只是停在门口。从那里，她静静地注视着他。真嗣转向她，随即又转回桌前，因为他再也忍受不了她那毫无表情的脸。一股对她的旧怨，他以为早已遗忘并埋葬的情感，再次燃起，令真嗣感到厌恶。他讨厌让美里失望。他也讨厌美里不请自来地对他抱有期望，并在他未能达到时感到失望。而最让他痛恨的，是自己竟如此怨恨且不知感恩。他真是大胆。真嗣今天的所作所为理应受到责备，甚至在美里开口之前，他就已经对她心怀怨恨。他没有权利这样做。

After a brief but suffocating silence, Misato finally stepped into the room, the door closing behind her. She then reached out to the side and flicked on the light switch. A bright light pierced Shinji's eyes, assaulting his already exhausted senses. He closed his eyes and frowned. Misato's brisk footsteps echoed coldly as she crossed the room and sat down across the table from him. When Shinji opened his eyes again, the expression on her face was impossible to read. Shinji averted his gaze. Misato sighed at that.  
经过一段短暂而令人窒息的沉默后，美里终于走进了房间，门在她身后关上。她随即伸手向旁边一挥，打开了电灯开关。刺眼的灯光穿透了真嗣的眼睛，攻击着他本已疲惫不堪的感官。他闭上眼睛，皱起了眉头。美里急促的脚步声冷冷地回荡着，她穿过房间，坐在了桌子对面。当真嗣再次睁开眼睛时，她的表情难以捉摸。真嗣移开了视线。美里对此叹了口气。

"How are you feeling?" “你感觉怎么样？”

_Cold. Dizzy. Tired, but not sleepy. My entire body hurts. And I was really scared earlier. I thought God was punishing me because I couldn't breathe out of nowhere, even though no one was choking me._ Shinji swallowed those words, all of them. He didn't think he was in any position to complain, so he just shook his head helplessly.  
寒冷。晕眩。疲惫，但并不困倦。全身都在疼痛。而且刚才我真的吓坏了。我以为上帝在惩罚我，因为我突然无法呼吸，尽管没有人掐住我。真嗣咽下了这些话，全部。他觉得自己没有资格抱怨，于是只是无奈地摇了摇头。

Misato folded her arms and stretched out an index finger to tap her upper arm. Shinji was both intimidated and angered by the gesture. The quick tapping sound her finger made was annoying. It didn't occur to him that maybe Misato was just as frustrated as he was instead of angry or annoyed. His mind refused to interpret it that way.  
美里交叉双臂，伸出食指轻敲着自己的上臂。真嗣既感到害怕又感到愤怒。她手指快速敲击的声音令人烦躁。他没想到也许美里和他一样感到沮丧，而不是生气或烦恼。他的思维拒绝这样解读。

"Shinji Ikari." 碇真嗣。

Shinji shivered at the coldness in her voice.  
真嗣因她声音中的冷意而颤抖。

"As long as you're fighting for the fate of mankind as an Evangelion pilot, your body is not entirely your own. I am obligated to be aware at all times of the physical conditions of my pilots, as it directly relates to their level of combat readiness. It is your solemn duty to cooperate to the best of your ability. So answer me. How are you feeling? Did you have any phantom pain episodes today? Did you get hurt?"  
“只要你作为一名 EVA 驾驶员为人类的命运而战，你的身体就不完全属于你自己。我有义务时刻关注我的驾驶员的身体状况，这直接关系到他们的战斗准备水平。你有责任尽你所能地配合。所以回答我。你感觉如何？今天有没有出现幻痛？你受伤了吗？”

_And I thought you were worried about me._ Shinji bit his lip for a moment, then opened his mouth. "I'm dizzy. I have no strength in my hands and feet. But at least I haven't had any phantom pain episodes since this morning."  
“我还以为你在担心我呢。”真嗣咬了咬嘴唇，然后开口道，“我头晕。手脚无力。但至少从早上开始就没有幻痛发作。”

A short sigh from Misato again. Shinji kept his eyes on the desk in front of him.  
Misato 再次轻叹一声。真嗣的目光始终停留在面前的桌子上。

"Guess you're in much better shape than that kid."  
“看来你比那孩子状态好多了。”

Shinji needed a moment to understand what she meant. When he did, his head shot up to check Misato's face. Her expression was blank, giving nothing away.  
真嗣需要片刻来理解她的意思。当他明白过来时，猛地抬头查看美里脸上的表情。她的表情毫无波澜，什么也看不出来。

"Cheekbone fractures and ocular injury, that's what I heard. He's undergoing surgery right now. His left eye is a mess. They're afraid there's going to be long-term damage to his vision from that side."  
颧骨骨折和眼部损伤，我听说是这样。他现在正在接受手术。他的左眼一团糟。他们担心那边的视力会有长期损伤。

Shinji opened his mouth but nothing came out. His throat felt swollen. It was hard to breathe, let alone talk. Misato shook her head quietly. "Don't worry too much. I asked them myself. He's not going to go completely blind. They said it could have been really dangerous if the glasses had broken, but they didn't. It was the nose support scratching everywhere after its pad fell off that did the most damage."  
真嗣张开嘴，却什么也没说出来。他的喉咙感觉肿胀。呼吸都困难，更别提说话了。美里轻轻地摇了摇头。“别太担心。我亲自问过他们了。他不会完全失明的。他们说如果眼镜碎了可能会很危险，但并没有。是鼻托的垫片脱落，四处刮擦造成了最大的伤害。”

Glasses. Shinji felt guilt beginning to squeeze his chest, but then clenched his teeth. He had no reason to feel sorry for him. Yeah, there was nothing to be sorry about.  
眼镜。真嗣感到内疚开始挤压他的胸口，但随即咬紧了牙关。他没有理由为他感到抱歉。是的，没什么好抱歉的。

Was there? 在吗？

_Who do you think you are?_ He heard that shrill voice again. Misato's words continued while Shinji dropped his eyes again.  
你以为你是谁？他又听到了那尖锐的声音。美里的话语继续着，而真嗣再次垂下了眼眸。

"Shinji, as I already said, you bear a heavy responsibility. It's not a small thing for even an ordinary boy to hurt someone as badly as you did today. _You_ doing that is a huge deal, probably a hundred times bigger than you can imagine." Misato paused then, obviously expecting an answer, but Shinji kept his mouth shut and head down. Misato continued after some time. "This isn't the first time you acted violently. Remember the Fourth Angel? When you suddenly… did that? Hey, are you listening? I'm actually more worried about you potentially losing control and behaving erratically while in combat than some school kid losing his eye. Do you understand what I mean?"  
“真嗣，正如我之前所说，你肩负着重大的责任。即使是普通男孩，像你今天这样严重伤害他人也不是小事。你这么做，影响之大，可能是你无法想象的百倍。”美里顿了顿，显然在等待回答，但真嗣紧闭双唇，低头不语。过了一会儿，美里继续说道：“这不是你第一次采取暴力行为。还记得第四使徒吗？你突然……那样做了？嘿，你在听吗？我其实更担心你在战斗中失控，行为失常，而不是某个学生失去眼睛。你明白我的意思吗？”

Her tone lifted at the end, and Shinji's head went up reflexively at that. Misato's narrowed eyes had a strange light in them, but Shinji did not want to try and guess what it meant. The mental fatigue was too much. So he just nodded thoughtlessly.  
她的语气在句尾上扬，这让真嗣的头不由自主地抬了起来。美里眯起的眼睛里闪烁着一种奇异的光芒，但真嗣并不想试图猜测那意味着什么。精神上的疲惫太过沉重。所以他只是无意识地点了点头。

Misato glared at him silently. Shinji lowered his eyes and stared at her folded arms. A few seconds passed, and Misato's shoulders relaxed a bit as her arms unfolded.  
美里默默地瞪着他。真嗣垂下眼帘，盯着她交叉的双臂。几秒钟过去了，美里的肩膀稍微放松了一些，双臂也随之展开。

"I just got out of a meeting. About what disciplinary measures will be taken against you. Since what happened today wasn't something we could just look away from."  
“我刚开完一个会。关于将对你采取什么纪律处分。毕竟今天发生的事情不是我们可以视而不见的。”

Silence fell. Misato probably wanted him to fill it, but Shinji didn't say a word. Thankfully, she gave up quickly this time. "Ritsuko recommended therapy. I thought she wasn't serious at first, but she formally insisted on it even after the meeting started."  
"沉默降临。美里大概希望他来打破它，但真嗣一言不发。幸好，这次她很快放弃了。“律子推荐了心理治疗。起初我以为她不是认真的，但会议开始后她正式坚持这一点。””

The direction her words were flowing naturally led Shinji to one certain topic he wanted to avoid. He spoke up with a dry throat. "What about Father? Does he know?"  
"她的话语自然地引导真嗣触及一个他想回避的话题。他干涩地开口：“父亲呢？他知道吗？””

Misato's mouth closed, then reopened. "Of course he knows. He was present at the meeting. Or, well, he participated in the meeting, through video calling. The final decision was delegated to me."  
"美里的嘴闭上，又张开。“他当然知道。他参加了会议。呃，是通过视频通话参与的。最终决定权交给了我。””

_You mean he wasn't too interested._ Shinji chewed his lips silently. He didn't even know what else he was expecting. Not like Father being angry would've done any good; it would have been equally unbearable. He verbalized the second question that came to his mind, to avoid thinking too much about Father. "Then what are you going to do?"  
"你是说他不太感兴趣。真嗣默默地咬着嘴唇。他甚至不知道自己还期待什么。父亲生气也不会有什么好处；那同样难以忍受。他提出了脑海中浮现的第二个问题，以避免过多思考关于父亲的事情。“那你打算怎么办？””

"I thought about sending you to the brig. I would've consulted with the doctors first to see if you were in any condition to go through it. If you weren't, I'd have checked again next week, and the week after that."  
“我考虑过把你送到禁闭室。我会先咨询医生，看看你是否有条件接受。如果不行，我会下周再检查，再下周也一样。”

Shinji clenched his fist. Even though it felt like his head was spinning, he was able to process that her words were in the past tense. "Then why didn't you?"  
真嗣握紧了拳头。尽管感觉头昏脑涨，他还是能理解她的话是过去时态。“那你为什么没这么做？”

Misato said nothing for a moment, then sighed. "Shinji, before we get into this…what you did today was very wrong. I'm not in any way condoning it. Understand?"  
美里沉默了一会儿，然后叹了口气。“真嗣，在我们深入讨论之前……你今天做的事非常不对。我绝不是在纵容你。明白吗？”

Shinji nodded. Misato scratched her chin.  
真嗣点点头。美里挠了挠下巴。

"While I was considering the brig, I was given a second report. This one had more details, like what exactly our people confiscated from school."  
“虽然我在考虑关禁闭的事，但我收到了第二份报告。这份报告有更多细节，比如我们的人从学校没收了什么。”

Feeling his face stiffening, Shinji looked up. Misato shook her head. "I always got a weird vibe from that Aida kid, but I never expected him to go that far. To be honest? I don't even blame you that much for hitting him like you did."  
感觉到脸颊僵硬，真嗣抬起头来。美里摇了摇头。“我一直觉得那个相田小子有点怪，但没想到他会做到那种地步。说实话？我甚至不怎么怪你当时揍他。”

_Should I feel at ease now? Can I smile?_ Shinji still felt like there was a thorn stuck in the center of his chest. "Do I get therapy then? Counseling?"  
我现在应该感到安心吗？我能笑出来吗？真嗣仍然觉得胸口中央像扎了一根刺。“那我需要接受治疗吗？心理咨询？”

Misato's lips curled up to form a bitter smile. "What do you think? Do you think you need it?"  
美里的嘴角勾起一抹苦笑。“你怎么看？你觉得自己需要吗？”

Shinji bit his lip. _Do I? Would it help me?_  
真嗣咬了咬嘴唇。我该吗？这会对我有帮助吗？

It was Misato who answered instead. "No, you don't. You're not crazy, Shinji. You just made a mistake while you were sick and thoroughly exhausted. You were agitated, and not in the right frame of mind. And your motivation wasn't even too out there. It would be ridiculous to treat you like a psycho or something. Therapy? Psych meds? What the hell."  
反倒是美里回答了。"不，你不用。你没疯，真嗣。你只是生病又极度疲惫时犯了个错误。你当时情绪激动，心态也不对。而且你的动机并不算离谱。把你当成精神病什么的，简直荒谬。心理治疗？精神药物？搞什么鬼。

Misato shook her head when Shinji didn't answer. "Ritsuko suspects post-traumatic stress disorder. What do you think about that?"  
美里摇了摇头，见真嗣没有回答。"律子怀疑是创伤后应激障碍。你怎么看？

He had nothing to say, this time because he didn't understand a word of what she said. "Post what?"  
他这次无言以对，因为她说的每一个字他都听不懂。“发什么？”

"Oh, yeah, of course you don't understand." Misato licked her lower lip. "Have you heard of Impact Disease? It's the same thing. Well, not really, but close enough."  
“哦，对了，你当然不懂。”美里舔了舔下唇。“你听说过冲击病吗？差不多就是那个意思。嗯，也不完全是，但足够接近了。”

Shinji's body stiffened. Yeah, he knew about that one. He heard about it quite often. In the news, in the newspapers, from adults talking. It described people who acted impulsively and were prone to crime because their brains were permanently broken by Second Impact. Shinji felt immense distress upon realizing that he was now being compared to those kinds of people.  
真嗣的身体僵硬了。是的，他听说过那个。他经常在新闻、报纸和成年人的谈话中听到。它描述那些因为第二次冲击导致大脑永久受损，从而行为冲动、容易犯罪的人。真嗣意识到自己现在被拿来与这类人相比，感到极度痛苦。

"Yes, I've heard of it."  
"是的，我听说过。"

"You don't think that describes you, do you? Ritsuko is your typical book-smart girl, not really taking the nuances of reality into account. Siccing doctors on you and medicating you into oblivion because you were defending your friend? And she's not even considering the effects, I think."  
"你不觉得这描述的就是你吗？律子是个典型的书呆子，不太考虑现实的复杂性。因为你是在保护朋友，就叫医生来对付你，还给你用药到不省人事？而且她甚至没考虑过后果，我觉得。"

"The effects? Would something happen to me?"  
"后果？我会出什么事吗？"

"The fact that you were on those kinds of medications would be on your medical record permanently."  
"你服用过那些药物的事实会永久记录在你的医疗档案中。"

"Oh."

"We're asking you to sacrifice your childhood. We can't possibly destroy your future, can we? Even as we speak, our people are working on it. I ordered it myself. Confiscating evidence, silencing people, and destroying records. I can't wipe away rumors and memories, but anyway, today's incident didn't happen, at least officially. There isn't any record of the assault or treatment. And there's only one thing I want in return. Get your act together and never make this kind of mistake again. Will you promise me?"  
"我们要求你牺牲你的童年。我们不能毁掉你的未来，对吧？即便此刻，我们的人正在为此努力。我亲自下的命令。没收证据，封口他人，销毁记录。我无法抹去谣言和记忆，但无论如何，今天的事件没有发生过，至少官方记录中没有。没有关于袭击或治疗的记录。而我只要求你一件事作为回报。振作起来，不要再犯这种错误。你能答应我吗？"

Misato's voice had a certain level of confidence in it that Shinji was sure was completely misplaced. He didn't agree with her opinion of him. He didn't feel confident enough in himself to make such a promise, even if "getting his act together" was all he needed to do. Even if it was the right thing to do. Even if doing so would be helpful to Shinji himself.  
美里的话语中带着一种自信，但真嗣确信这种自信完全放错了地方。他并不认同她对他的看法。他觉得自己没有足够的自信去做出这样的承诺，即便“振作起来”是他需要做的全部。即便这是正确的事。即便这样做对真嗣自己也有帮助。

_Erasing the record,_ she said. What he really wanted to erase was the guilt, anger, and confusion in his heart, and if therapy was what it took, he was willing to try it. But the soft expression on her face and the sound of her voice, which had at some point lost all of its coldness, aroused a new kind of guilt in his heart. She was doing him a huge favor, even though he was clearly at fault. He couldn't possibly reject what she was offering and disappoint her even more.  
她提议抹去记录，而他真正想抹去的是内心的愧疚、愤怒和困惑。如果治疗是必要的，他愿意尝试。但她脸上柔和的表情和她声音中不知何时消失的冷漠，在他心中激起了一种新的愧疚感。她在帮他一个大忙，尽管显然是他的错。他不可能拒绝她的好意，让她更加失望。

So Shinji nodded helplessly. Misato reached out and ruffled his hair, chuckling. Her smile grew even bigger as Shinji forced one of his own while blushing.  
于是真嗣无奈地点了点头。美里伸出手揉乱了他的头发，轻声笑了起来。当真嗣勉强挤出一个微笑并脸红时，她的笑容变得更加灿烂。

"It's alright. Don't be so miserable. You're a boy. Boys fight. I mean, I'm not saying it's a good thing, but that sort of thing just happens sometimes. It's normal. You're normal. You're not crazy. Or bad."  
“没关系。别这么难过。你是男孩。男孩们会打架。我是说，我并不是说这是好事，但有时候这种事就是会发生。这是正常的。你是正常的。你不是疯了。也不是坏孩子。”

Shinji clenched his teeth. She didn't know anything. He had a problem. He deliberately injured Kensuke some more, even after beating him to a pulp in a blind rage. He was vile. Even now, he was already starting to forget his guilt, starting to feel good, just because Misato was acting somewhat supportive of him. The objective truth about his deeds hadn't changed and never would, but it was changing in his mind because of what other people thought about the situation. She was completely unaware of what Shinji really was.  
真嗣咬紧牙关。她一无所知。他有问题。他在盲目狂怒中将剑介打得体无完肤后，还故意加重了他的伤势。他卑鄙无耻。即便如此，现在他已经开始忘记自己的罪恶感，开始感到好受，仅仅因为美里在某种程度上支持他。他行为的客观事实并未改变，也永远不会改变，但在他心中，这一切正在因他人对情况的看法而改变。她完全不了解真嗣的真实面目。

Misato must not have known what he was thinking, because her smile was as bright as it was before. "Don't get too cocky because you won some points with Asuka or something. Look for other ways next time, okay? I'll still punish you somehow, beware of that too."  
美里肯定不知道他在想什么，因为她的笑容和之前一样灿烂。“别因为赢得了明日香的一些好感就得意忘形。下次找其他方法，好吗？我还会以某种方式惩罚你，也要小心这一点。”

Forgetting all of his complicated feelings, forgetting even the latter half of Misato's words, Shinji blushed. That part was the most shameful and regrettable part of this whole ordeal. "It's not like that! It's…"  
真嗣忘记了所有复杂的情感，甚至忘记了美里后半段的话，他的脸红了。那部分是整个事件中最羞愧和最令人后悔的部分。“不是那样的！而是……”

Misato snorted, almost contemptuously. That enraged Shinji, but his reddening face must have sent the wrong message to her.  
美里嗤之以鼻，几乎带着轻蔑。这让真嗣感到愤怒，但他涨红的脸可能向她传递了错误的信息。

"Is that why Asuka was there with you even before Section 2? What did you two do? Were you holding hands like I caught you doing last time? That was so cute, by the way."  
“这就是为什么在第二课之前，明日香就和你在一起了？你们俩做了什么？是不是像我上次撞见的那样牵着手？顺便说一句，那真是太可爱了。”

_You're making it sound like Asuka rushed to me first thing, when in reality the agents weren't even that fast._ Shinji swallowed the words. It wasn't important anyway. "Asuka came because she was mad at me. She told me that she didn't want my help and that she really didn't appreciate it."  
你这话说得好像明日香第一时间就冲到我这儿来了，实际上那些特工都没那么快。真嗣咽下了这些话。反正也不重要。“明日香来是因为她对我生气。她告诉我她不需要我的帮助，并且她真的不感激。”

Misato sighed. As Shinji sulked and said nothing, Misato shook her head and leaned against the back of her chair. "Oh, you stupid brats."  
美里叹了口气。看着真嗣闷闷不乐一言不发，美里摇了摇头，靠在椅背上。“哦，你们这些傻孩子。”

"Ms. Misato…" “美里小姐…”

"Never mind, it's you kids' business to settle, not mine. Did you eat something? You have to eat congee, right?"  
“算了，这是你们小孩子之间的事，我不管了。你吃了什么吗？得吃点粥，对吧？”

"There's a lunch box in my bag. Haven't opened it yet."  
"包里有便当盒，还没打开。"

"Okay, eat and rest here. I'll pick you up later when the work's done."  
"好，在这儿吃吧，休息一下。工作结束后我来接你。"

---

The problem of dinner was easily solved. Misato strongly insisted on (and Asuka meekly conceded to) getting pizza delivered. And Shinji warmed up a bowl of congee that he'd made and put in the refrigerator that morning. He must have calculated the portion wrong, because even after dinner there was a sizable amount remaining in the pot. He figured he could eat that for breakfast and lunch tomorrow. While his housemates holed up in their rooms, Shinji put on an apron, SDAT earbuds in his ears, and washed the dishes beneath the orange glow of the setting summer sun.  
晚餐的问题轻松解决了。美里坚决要求（而明日香顺从地同意）叫披萨外卖。真嗣则热了一碗早上做好的粥，放进冰箱里。他一定是算错了分量，因为晚餐后锅里还剩下不少。他想着可以留着明天早餐和午餐吃。当室友们各自躲在房间里时，真嗣穿上围裙，戴上 SDAT 耳塞，在夏日夕阳的橙色余晖中洗着碗碟。

Because of the sound of water and music, Shinji didn't hear the doorbell ring. It was the sound of Misato's voice that made him pluck out an earbud.  
因为水声和音乐的干扰，真嗣没有听到门铃声。直到美里小姐的声音传来，他才摘下了一只耳塞。

"Hey Shinji!" she shouted. "Can you get the door, please? It must be a delivery or something!"  
“嘿，真嗣！”她喊道，“能去开下门吗？应该是快递什么的！”

Shinji groaned, put down the SDAT, and headed for the hallway.  
真嗣叹了口气，放下 SDAT，走向走廊。

When Shinji opened the door, it wasn't a delivery man standing on the other side, but Hikari Horaki, a shy smile on her face. She was holding a transparent folder full of white papers in one hand and a small paper bag in the other.  
当真嗣打开门时，站在门外的人并非快递员，而是脸上带着羞涩微笑的班长洞木光。她一手拿着装满白纸的透明文件夹，另一手提着一个小纸袋。

"Good evening, Ikari. How are you feeling? Is everything alright?"  
“晚上好，碇同学。你感觉怎么样？一切都还好吗？”

"Oh, hello, Class Rep. I'm alright. Much better. Thank you. What's up? Want to come in?"  
“哦，班长你好。我还好，好多了。谢谢关心。有什么事吗？要进来坐坐吗？”

Horaki shook her head, put the bag on the floor, and pulled a piece of paper from the file. "It's okay, I'm not here for tea or anything. Here's an announcement for students' future career counseling for parents. It was supposed to be delivered tomorrow, but…"  
碇司令摇了摇头，将包放在地上，从文件夹中抽出一张纸。“没关系，我不是来喝茶的。这是给家长的学生未来职业规划通知。原本明天才要送出的，但……”

Shinji frowned and accepted the paper while Horaki pulled out another one from the file. _Career counseling? Am I supposed to tell Father about this?_ The mere thought made his throat dry.  
真嗣皱起眉头接过纸张，而碇司令又从文件夹中拿出另一张。职业规划？我该告诉父亲这件事吗？光是想到这点就让他喉咙发干。

"And this, a letter of suspension. Think of it as a two-week break."  
“还有这个，停职信。就当是两周的假期吧。”

Somehow Shinji felt nothing as he accepted the second paper. He expected it, on a distant, unconscious level. The only thing he could think about was whether Misato would be able to erase this from the record too. It was not until he was halfway through the cold and professional phrases of the letter that Shinji realized that Horaki seemed as unfazed as he did.  
不知为何，真嗣接过第二张纸时内心毫无波澜。在某个遥远而无意识的地方，他早已预料到了。他唯一能想到的是，美里是否也能将这一记录抹去。直到他读到信中那些冷漠而专业的措辞时，才意识到洞木似乎和他一样镇定。

"You're not going to scold me or anything?"  
“你不会骂我什么的吧？”

Horaki smiled weakly. "Maybe I should. Violence is not right! I'm really disappointed in you, Ikari!" She sighed. "But, to be honest, I don't think I can. I've come to see both of you in a new light, you know."  
洞木虚弱地笑了笑。“也许我应该骂你。暴力是不对的！我对你真的很失望，真嗣！”她叹了口气。“但说实话，我觉得我做不到。我已经重新审视了你们俩，你知道的。”

Shinji swallowed, feeling his face stiffening. He felt like saying something, but couldn't come up with anything. It was Horaki that saved the moment and prevented it from becoming completely awkward.  
真嗣咽了咽口水，感觉自己的脸僵硬了。他本想说些什么，却什么也想不出来。是洞木救了场，避免了气氛彻底陷入尴尬。

"Well, I suppose you must be curious. Nothing has been decided about Aida for now. I don't think we'll see him ever again, though."  
“嗯，我想你一定很好奇。关于相田的事，目前还没有定论。不过，我想我们可能再也见不到他了。”

Shinji nodded with a cooling heart. A total and irreversible end of the friendship. That was probably for the best, he figured. He wondered if he should tell Horaki what Misato told him about Kensuke's condition, but decided against it. He had no reason to do so, and it would just give Horaki an even worse impression anyway.  
真嗣心凉地点了点头。这段友谊彻底且不可逆转地结束了。他觉得这样或许最好。他不知道是否应该告诉洞木美里关于健介的情况，但最终决定不这么做。他没有理由这样做，而且这只会让洞木对健介的印象更差。

Horaki tilted her head to peek over Shinji's shoulder. "How's Asuka? You guys talked about what happened, right?"  
Horaki 歪着头，从真嗣的肩膀上方偷看。“明日香怎么样了？你们谈过发生的事了吧？”

_More like she got angry at me for no reason and then threw a bag at me,_ Shinji didn't say. He just shook his head. "Not really."  
倒不如说她无缘无故对我发火，然后还扔了个包过来，真嗣没这么说。他只是摇了摇头。“没怎么谈。”

Horaki smiled shyly. Shinji didn't understand the reaction.  
Horaki 腼腆地笑了笑。真嗣不太明白她的反应。

"Are you sure, Ikari? Nothing? Didn't you two leave school together? Asuka disappeared on her own. It gave me a bit of trouble with her attendance record, you know."  
"碇，你确定吗？什么都没有？你们俩不是一起离校的吗？明日香是自己消失的。她的出勤记录给我添了不少麻烦，你知道的。"

Only then did Shinji realize what Horaki was implying. Bitterness and anger filled his heart.  
直到那时，真嗣才意识到洞木在暗示什么。苦涩和愤怒充满了他的心。

"No, we didn't. Nothing happened. Asuka just… she was a little bit angry, that's all."  
"不，我们没有。什么都没发生。明日香只是……她有点生气，仅此而已。"

Horaki shook her head as Shinji slouched. "You're too hard on yourself, Ikari. Don't be. I understand you."  
Horaki 摇了摇头，看着 Shinji 垂头丧气的样子。“你对自己太苛刻了，Ikari。别这样。我理解你。”

Shinji's stomach flattened at that. He secretly hoped for Asuka to like what he did, maybe _'reward'_ him, even. It was so beyond pathetic that he almost wanted to kill himself. How could she possibly understand such a feeling? Then he realized Horaki probably wasn't talking about that.  
听到这话，Shinji 的胃都紧缩了。他暗自希望 Asuka 会喜欢他所做的事，甚至可能会‘奖励’他。这实在是太可悲了，他几乎想自杀。她怎么可能理解这种感觉呢？然后他意识到 Horaki 可能说的不是这个。

"What Aida did…" Horaki sighed, her eyes flashing. "I understand why you did that to him. I won't ever compliment you on it, but I understand."  
“Aida 那件事……”Horaki 叹了口气，眼中闪过一丝光芒。“我理解你为什么那样对他。我不会因此称赞你，但我理解。”

"Do you?" _I don't, so why does everyone else act like they do?_ Shinji thought it was absurd. Was beating the hell out of Kensuke really not a big deal? Was he the only person fussing about it?  
"你呢？" 我不这么认为，那为什么其他人表现得好像是这样？真嗣觉得这很荒谬。难道把 Kensuke 打得半死不活真的没什么大不了的吗？难道只有他在为此烦恼吗？

Horaki nodded, smiling. "It's a boy's job to protect his girl, you know."  
Horaki 点头微笑。"你知道，保护自己的女孩是男孩的责任。"

Shinji was at a loss for words. Two heartbeats later, he felt his face heating up. "No! That's not it! We're not…she's not…"  
真嗣无言以对。两拍心跳之后，他感到自己的脸在发热。"不！不是那样的！我们不是……她不是……"

Horaki stared at Shinji without a word, her smile persisting. Shinji's face turned beet red.  
Horaki 一言不发地盯着 Shinji，笑容依旧。Shinji 的脸涨得通红。

"Besides, Asuka…she doesn't need anyone's protection."  
“再说了，Asuka…她不需要任何人的保护。”

"Her words, I guess?" “大概是她的话吧？”

"Yeah." "嗯。"

Horaki shook her head. "Well, she's very proud, so I'm not surprised. But I'm sure she's still grateful."  
Horaki 摇了摇头。“嗯，她非常骄傲，所以我并不惊讶。但我确信她仍然心存感激。”

Shinji just shrugged, losing the will to argue further. Horaki smiled at that. "Don't look so down, Ikari, Good deeds are rewarded in the end. Otherwise there's no reason for anyone to live, is there?"  
Shinji 只是耸了耸肩，失去了继续争论的意愿。Horaki 见状笑了。“别这么沮丧，Ikari，善行终将得到回报。否则，人们活着还有什么意义呢？”

"What are you two talking about, standing there for so long?"  
“你们俩站在那儿聊什么呢，这么久？”

Shinji almost screamed in surprise at the shrill voice coming from behind him. He looked back to find Asuka standing on the border between the entrance corridor and the kitchen, arms folded.  
真嗣差点被身后尖锐的声音吓得尖叫起来。他回头一看，发现明日香正站在入口走廊和厨房的交界处，双臂交叉。

"Hey, Asuka!" Horaki waved and picked up the bag that had been at her feet this whole time. "I've actually got something for you, too. I saw a bench down there, can we go sit and talk a little?"  
“嘿，明日香！”洞木挥了挥手，捡起了脚边一直放着的袋子。“其实我也有东西要给你。我在下面看到一条长椅，我们可以去那里坐下聊聊吗？”

Asuka snorted and stomped her way to the door. Both Shinji and Asuka didn't even spare a glance at each other as Asuka passed him and put on slippers. Horaki nodded goodbye to Shinji with a small smile on her lips. Then the two girls headed toward the elevator together. Shinji closed the door with a heavy heart.  
明日香哼了一声，大步走向门口。真嗣和明日香彼此都没有看对方一眼，明日香从他身边走过，穿上拖鞋。洞木向真嗣点头告别，嘴角带着淡淡的微笑。随后，两个女孩一起向电梯走去。真嗣心情沉重地关上了门。

As he entered the living room, Misato called out from her room. "Was it a courier?"  
当他走进客厅时，美里从她的房间里喊道：“是快递吗？”

Shinji opened his mouth, closed it again, and headed to his room without another word.  
真嗣张了张嘴，又闭上了，一言不发地朝自己的房间走去。

It was not until he threw the papers on the desk and his body on the bed that he remembered that he left the SDAT in the kitchen. But he didn't even have the energy to stand up and get it.  
直到他把文件扔在桌上，身体倒在床上，他才想起他把 SDAT 落在了厨房。但他连站起身去拿的力气都没有了。

After a few minutes spent gathering his strength and will, Shinji forced himself up with a grunt and left the room, only to run right into Asuka. She was entering the kitchen, Horaki's bag in her hand. He wondered what was in it, but soon remembered that he was still angry at her. He turned to the table where the SDAT sat. Asuka flinched, as if wanting to say something, then clenched her fist and headed to her room. Shinji watched her back, feeling a sense of liberation.  
经过几分钟的聚力与决心，真嗣闷哼一声强迫自己起身，离开了房间，却迎面撞上了明日香。她正拿着洞木的包走进厨房。他好奇里面装了什么，但很快记起自己还在生她的气。他转向放着 SDAT 的桌子。明日香微微一颤，似乎想说些什么，随即握紧拳头走向自己的房间。真嗣注视着她的背影，感到一种解脱。

Nothing happened that night until he fell asleep.  
那一夜直到他入睡，什么也没发生。

---

He was walking in a field of reeds. The fog was so dense that he felt his nostrils moistening up, and nothing could be seen beyond the reach of his hands. A red dot swayed dimly ahead. He walked towards it for no other reason than the ungrounded but unquestionable conviction of the dreamer.  
他漫步在一片芦苇丛中。雾气浓重到让他的鼻孔都感到湿润，伸手不见五指。前方隐约摇曳着一个红点。他无因地向其走去，仅凭梦境中无根却不容置疑的信念。

Halfway to his destination, Shinji realized that the red dot he was pursuing was Kensuke's campfire. It was the very same place where he met Kensuke when he first ran away from Misato's house. Fear might have ordinarily brought him to a halt, but the next moment he was standing right in front of the campfire. Beyond the fire sat Kensuke, wearing the same field vest and holding his plastic gun. Just like before. A single playful brown eye looked up at Shinji over two tins hung over the fire.  
在前往目的地的半途中，真嗣意识到他所追逐的红点是健司的篝火。正是这个地方，他在第一次逃离美里家时遇到了健司。恐惧本可能让他停下脚步，但下一刻，他已站在篝火前。火堆的另一边坐着健司，穿着同样的野外背心，手持塑料枪，一如往昔。一只调皮的棕色眼睛从火上悬挂的两个罐子上方望向真嗣。

Next to that eye was a blackened hole where the other used to be. A single vein of dark blood trickled out of it. Shinji's throat tightened.  
那只眼睛旁边是一个焦黑的洞，原本的另一只眼睛所在之处。一条暗红的血丝从中缓缓流出。真嗣的喉咙紧绷起来。

"Hey, Shinji! You're here again! I've been waiting for you, you know. Camping is pretty fun when you're busy setting up a tent and struggling with a flint, but when it's all done and you're sitting alone, it gets boring really fast! I was glad to see you back then for precisely that reason."  
“嘿，真嗣！你又来了！我一直在等你，你知道的。搭帐篷和用打火石生火时挺有趣的，但一切完成后，独自坐着，很快就无聊了！那时见到你，我真的很高兴，就是因为这个原因。”

Kensuke tapped the empty field chair next to him. Perhaps it had been there the whole time, or it had just been created by his dream. "Back then, I thought we got pretty close after that night. Do you think we'll be friends again if we spend the night together? Like the last time?"  
健介轻敲着身旁空无一人的野营椅。或许它一直就在那里，又或许只是梦境创造出来的。“那时候，我以为那晚之后我们变得很亲近了。你觉得如果我们再共度一夜，还能像上次那样成为朋友吗？”

As he moved to the chair, Shinji braced himself. It was just a dream brought on by his guilt. In reality, Kensuke's wound wasn't that bad. And even if it was, he shouldn't really feel sorry for that little shit. He didn't do anything wrong. Right? Right?  
当他走向那把椅子时，真嗣做好了心理准备。这不过是由他的愧疚引发的梦境。实际上，健介的伤并没有那么严重。即便如此，他也不该为那个小混蛋感到难过。他并没有做错什么。对吧？对吧？

But as soon as he sat next to Kensuke, immersed in the pouring heat of the campfire, and looked upon that freckled face, his resolve collapsed. Shinji buried his face in his lap, breaking down in tears.  
但当他一坐到健介旁边，沉浸在篝火的热浪中，凝视着那张布满雀斑的脸庞时，他的决心瞬间瓦解。真嗣将脸埋在膝间，崩溃地哭泣起来。

"I'm sorry, Kensuke, I, I…I'm still angry at you, but I didn't mean to go that far."  
"对不起，健介，我，我……我还是生你的气，但我没想做到那个地步。"

That was a lie. At that moment, when he was on top of the boy, Shinji made a choice, and he hurt him more because he wanted to. He didn't want to face that ugly truth even in his dream, though, so he chose another strategy. One he was very used to.  
那是个谎言。那一刻，当他压在男孩身上时，真嗣做出了选择，他伤害他更多是因为他想这么做。尽管在梦中，他也不愿面对这个丑陋的真相，所以他选择了另一种策略。一种他非常习惯的策略。

"I'm sorry," Shinji sobbed. "Forgive me…"  
"对不起，" 真嗣啜泣着。"原谅我……"

The trickle of blood from Kensuke's eye had made its way down his cheek to his chin, dripping off it slowly. Kensuke hummed thoughtfully and rubbed his chin, smearing the blood everywhere. He didn't seem to care. "What should I do?" the other boy mused.  
从 Kensuke 眼中流出的血丝沿着他的脸颊滑至下巴，缓缓滴落。Kensuke 若有所思地哼了一声，揉了揉下巴，将血迹抹得到处都是。他似乎并不在意。“我该怎么办？”另一个男孩沉思道。

As Shinji shook, Kensuke's hand suddenly popped out in front of his head. Shinji paused for a moment and looked up. A bright smile hung on Kensuke's face. "Ah, screw it. I forgive you! Not like I want to have Toji as my only friend, heh."  
当 Shinji 颤抖时，Kensuke 的手突然出现在他头前。Shinji 停顿了一下，抬头望去。Kensuke 的脸上挂着灿烂的笑容。“啊，管他呢。我原谅你了！总比只有 Toji 这一个朋友强，嘿。”

Shinji sobbed like a little child. Even now, the cold part of his heart was shouting that this was only a dream, that it was a pathetic attempt to soothe his guilt in any way possible. It would only hurt more when he inevitably woke up, but nonetheless, Shinji felt truly relieved at that moment. It seemed that the boulder that was pressing on his heart so firmly had finally been removed. Pleadingly, Shinji took Kensuke's extended hand with both of his.  
Shinji 像个孩子一样抽泣。即便此刻，他内心冰冷的一面仍在呐喊，这一切只是个梦，是试图以任何可能的方式安抚他罪恶感的可悲尝试。当他不可避免地醒来时，只会更加痛苦，但尽管如此，Shinji 在那一刻感到真正的释然。仿佛那块紧紧压在他心上的巨石终于被移开了。恳切地，Shinji 用双手握住了 Kensuke 伸出的手。

Kensuke stood up, chuckling, and loosened Shinji's grip. Then he passed the rifle to Shinji. Shinji looked up at Kensuke with blank eyes.  
健介站起身，轻声笑着，松开了真嗣的手。随后他将步枪递给了真嗣。真嗣抬头看向健介，眼神空洞。

"Will you put that back in the case, please? It's behind you. Now that the Three Stooges are restored properly, we should have a commemorative party! Oh, if only Toji was here too."  
“请你把它放回箱子里好吗？就在你身后。既然三傻大闹宝莱坞的戏码已经圆满落幕，我们该开个庆祝派对！哦，要是户次也在就好了。”

Shinji smiled shyly and stood up with a gun. At first, he thought it was just a plastic model gun, but it felt very heavy and cold in his hands now. While looking around for the case Kensuke mentioned, Shinji saw water bubbling out of the two tins placed on the fire. "Hey, Kensuke, that's…"  
真嗣腼腆地笑了笑，站起身来拿着枪。起初，他以为那只是一把塑料模型枪，但此刻它在他手中显得异常沉重而冰冷。在寻找健介提到的箱子时，真嗣看到火上的两个罐子里冒出了沸腾的水。“嘿，健介，那是……”

Kensuke hurriedly picked up the skewer that the tins were hung on and put it down, far away from the campfire. "Phew, almost burnt the rice. Nice catch, Shinji. We wouldn't get to have dessert today if it wasn't for you."  
Kensuke 急忙捡起挂着罐头的烤串，远远地放到远离篝火的地方。“呼，差点烧了米饭。好样的，真嗣。要不是你，我们今天可就没甜点吃了。”

Shinji smiled and nodded, then felt something weird. "Dessert?"  
真嗣微笑着点点头，随即感到有些奇怪。“甜点？”

Kensuke nodded enthusiastically. Droplets of blood from his eye flew everywhere at the gesture. "Yeah, dessert, the sweet stuff you eat after the main course. I told you we're going to have a party!"  
Kensuke 兴奋地点头，动作间眼角的血滴四溅。“对啊，甜点，主菜之后吃的甜甜的东西。我告诉过你我们要开派对的！”

_But those tins were already there when I came. Weren't they?_ Shinji thought so, but it was natural that dreams did not make sense. "What's the main course then?" he asked.  
但那些罐头在我来之前就已经在了，不是吗？真嗣这么想着，但梦境本就没有逻辑可言。“那么主菜是什么？”他问道。

With a sly smile, Kensuke pointed to the tent. It was a simple thing, just an army green canvas flung over some poles and staked to the earth. Through the slightly open flaps he saw only darkness. As he followed Kensuke to the tent, Shinji felt an inexplicable fear grip him for some reason. The gun, which he'd forgotten to put down, became as heavy as a lump of lead. His arms trembled. Then his whole body followed suit. He didn't know why he felt that way.  
健介狡黠一笑，指向帐篷。那不过是个简单的物件，几根杆子撑起军绿色的帆布，牢牢固定在地面上。透过微微敞开的帘子，他只看到一片黑暗。跟随健介走向帐篷时，真嗣不知为何感到一种莫名的恐惧。那把忘记放下的枪，此刻重如铅块，他的手臂颤抖，随后整个身体也跟着颤抖起来。他不知道自己为何会有这种感觉。

Kensuke opened the tent flap with a theatrical flourish and beckoned Shinji to come in. At that point Shinji felt as stressed as he did when he saw Angels through his Eva's eyes.  
健介以戏剧性的动作拉开帐篷帘子，示意真嗣进来。那一刻，真嗣感到的压力如同他透过 EVA 的眼睛看到使徒时一样巨大。

A funky smell welcomed him when he entered the dark tent. He blinked several times as his eyes slowly adapted to the darkness. Then Asuka appeared in front of him. She was lying limp and naked on a blanket on the floor, her arms and legs bound with ropes and a gag in her mouth. The only sign of life was her eyes, dark under the dim light, the look in them horribly blank.  
一股怪异的气味在他踏入黑暗的帐篷时迎面扑来。他眨了几次眼，眼睛慢慢适应了黑暗。随后，明日香出现在他面前。她瘫软地赤裸着躺在地板的毯子上，四肢被绳索捆绑，嘴里塞着口球。唯一显露生命迹象的是她的眼睛，在昏暗的光线下显得深邃，眼神却异常空洞。

Kensuke tapped Shinji's frozen shoulder. "You wouldn't believe how successful this business is. At this rate, I'll make enough money to arm a whole squad of JSSDF paratroopers! Oh, but don't worry too much. She looks a little out of it right now, but she's still willful, which means she's delicious enough when she's under you. I check the quality myself every day before I open, so you can trust me on that."  
“你绝对想不到这生意有多成功。照这样下去，我赚的钱足够装备一整队 JSSDF 伞兵！哦，不过别太担心。她现在看起来有点恍惚，但她还是那么倔强，这意味着当你压在她身上时，她足够美味。我每天开门前都会亲自检查质量，所以你可以相信我。”

As Shinji stood still with his mouth slightly open, Kensuke burst into laughter. "Are you surprised? Why? I thought you were fully aware of what I did when you came to beg for forgiveness. Not like I apologized for touching your precious Asuka!"  
“你惊讶吗？为什么？我以为你完全知道我来求原谅时做了什么。又不是我为碰了你珍贵的明日香而道歉！”

Shinji cringed reflexively as an ear-splitting noise ripped through the tent. An acrid, almost overwhelming smell permeated the air. Shinji looked around with his eyes wide open. Kensuke was lying on the ground. His missing eye was completely blown away, only a red ruin remaining. Half his brains and head and whatever else spilled from the wound in gruesome detail. Shinji looked down at his hands, bending over, feeling nauseous. The gun he had been carrying was directed at Kensuke's body, and white smoke was coming out of its barrel.  
一阵震耳欲聋的噪音撕裂了帐篷，真嗣本能地缩了缩身子。空气中弥漫着一股刺鼻、几乎令人窒息的气味。真嗣瞪大了眼睛环顾四周。剑介躺在地上，他缺失的那只眼睛完全被炸飞了，只剩下一片血肉模糊。半边大脑和头颅以及其他的什么东西从伤口中溢出，血腥而详细。真嗣低头看着自己的双手，弯下腰，感到一阵恶心。他手中的枪正对着剑介的身体，枪口冒出白烟。

_I shot him. I killed him._ Even as he thought this, he realized that he didn't feel much of anything about it. More than anything else, that scared and disgusted him. _This is a dream, I'm being weird because it's just a dream,_ he kept telling himself. He tried to throw the gun out of his hands, but it was like it was glued to them.  
我开枪打了他。我杀了他。尽管他这么想着，却发现自己对此并没有太多感觉。最让他害怕和厌恶的是这一点。这只是个梦，我之所以这么奇怪是因为这只是个梦，他不断地告诉自己。他试图把枪从手中甩掉，但它就像粘在了手上一样。

After several futile attempts, Shinji realized that he had forgotten the most important thing.  
经过几次徒劳的尝试后，真嗣意识到自己忘记了最重要的事情。

Shinji turned to the inside of the tent. Asuka was looking up at him. Shinji knelt beside her and looked around. Amidst the mess of used tissues and condoms, he found a multipurpose knife, just the kind of thing Kensuke would carry. As he reached for it, the rifle finally clattered to the floor. Shinji drew the knife and cut off the ropes, careful not to hurt her. Asuka took a deep breath when he removed the gag.  
真嗣转向帐篷内侧。明日香正抬头望着他。真嗣跪在她身边，环顾四周。在用过的纸巾和避孕套的混乱中，他找到了一把多功能刀，正是那种剑介会携带的类型。当他伸手去拿时，步枪终于哐啷一声掉到了地上。真嗣拔出刀，小心翼翼地割断了绳子，生怕伤到她。明日香在他取下口塞时深吸了一口气。

Impulsively, or daringly, because he knew this was a dream, Shinji embraced Asuka tightly. "Asuka, it's safe now. I killed him. I killed him. I won't let anyone touch you, Asuka."  
出于冲动，或者说大胆，因为他知道这是梦境，真嗣紧紧地拥抱着明日香。“明日香，现在安全了。我杀了他。我杀了他。我不会让任何人碰你，明日香。”

In his arms, he felt the strength escaping from Asuka's body. She sighed.  
在他怀里，他感觉到明日香的身体力量在流失。她叹了口气。

"Idiot Shinji. You've done _something_ today, I suppose." Her hand gently came up and caressed Shinji's cheek. "Not like I asked you to do this, but I guess I owe you. Maybe I should reward you accordingly, right? How about a kiss on the cheek?"  
"笨蛋真嗣。你今天做了些什么吧，我想。" 她的手轻轻抬起，抚摸着真嗣的脸颊。"虽然我没要求你这么做，但我猜我欠你一个人情。或许我应该相应地奖励你，对吧？来个脸颊上的吻怎么样？"

Tears filled Shinji's eyes. Did she even know how much her words and actions meant to him? He sobbed disgustingly, overwhelmed by pent-up emotion.  
泪水充满了真嗣的眼眶。她是否知道她的言语和行为对他意味着多少？他恶心地抽泣着，被压抑的情感所淹没。

"No, Asuka, you don't need to do that."  
"不，明日香，你不需要这么做。"

Asuka smirked. _"Liar._ That's exactly what you were hoping for."  
明日香微微一笑。“骗子。你明明就是那么希望的。”

"Asuka?" Shinji felt as if something cold and sharp pierced his chest.  
“明日香？”真嗣感觉仿佛有什么冰冷而尖锐的东西刺穿了他的胸膛。

"Idiot. When will you admit it? When will you admit you're so pathetic? When will you admit that you're selfish trash that only pretends to be nice because all you want is to be praised by others? Because you want to be praised by _me?_ That everything you do is centered on how to get it? Like in that volcano, or at school?"  
“笨蛋。你什么时候才会承认？什么时候才会承认自己如此可悲？什么时候才会承认你是个自私的垃圾，只是假装善良，因为你想要的只是得到别人的赞扬？因为你想要得到我的赞扬？你做的每一件事都是围绕着如何得到它？就像在那座火山里，或者在学校里那样？”

Shinji couldn't say anything. Asuka's fingers traced Shinji's jawline, then disappeared.  
真嗣什么也说不出来。明日香的指尖沿着真嗣的下巴划过，随后消失了。

"To me, you're not any different from that worm." She pointed to Kensuke's body, which was twitching in a pool of his own blood. "The two of you are exactly the same. Despicable, perverted, and unattractive. Mr. Kaji is the only man in the world I respect and want to give myself to. And you'll never get on his level no matter how hard you try. Because there are things in this world that are set from the moment you're born."  
“对我来说，你和那条虫没什么两样。”她指向健介的尸体，那尸体在血泊中抽搐着。“你们俩完全一样。卑鄙、变态、毫无吸引力。加持先生是我唯一尊敬并愿意献身于他的男人。而你永远也达不到他的高度，无论你怎么努力。因为有些事情从你出生的那一刻起就已经注定了。”

Asuka pushed him away roughly. Shinji fell on his bottom. Without paying any attention to the groaning Shinji, Asuka stood and walked to the middle of the tent. "I hope that worm didn't sell my clothes. They should be around here somewhere…"  
明日香粗暴地将他推开。真嗣跌坐在地上。明日香没有理会呻吟的真嗣，站起身走到帐篷中央。“希望那条虫没卖掉我的衣服。它们应该就在这附近……”

Shinji swallowed, dazed. There was no saliva to moisten his swollen throat. His ears were buzzing. Before he knew it his teeth started to chatter against each other. He looked down to find the rifle in his arms again. His hands lifted as if they had a will of their own and pointed it at Asuka's back. Shinji didn't understand. Wasn't it Kensuke, not Asuka, who he hated so much to the point of wanting to murder?  
真嗣咽了口唾沫，茫然失措。喉咙肿胀，没有唾液能润湿。耳朵里嗡嗡作响。不知不觉间，他的牙齿开始打颤。他低头一看，发现自己怀里又抱住了那把步枪。双手仿佛有了自己的意志，举起来对准了明日香的背影。真嗣不明白。他恨之入骨到想要杀死的，不是健司，而是明日香吗？

But as he repeated what Asuka told him in his mind, everything seemed suddenly clear. It seemed natural, even, for him to pull the trigger. Such a decision seemed completely reasonable. With a shaking hand, Shinji…  
但当他反复在心中回响明日香的话时，一切似乎突然变得清晰起来。扣动扳机似乎变得自然而然，甚至完全合情合理。真嗣颤抖着手……

---

Shinji gasped. It took him a long time to realize that he was not in the tent but in his own room. The loud noise outside his door was something clattering to the ground, not a gunshot. He didn't pull the trigger.  
真嗣倒吸了一口气。过了好一会儿，他才意识到自己不在帐篷里，而是在自己的房间里。门外传来的巨响是东西倒地的声音，而不是枪声。他没有扣动扳机。

Right? Shinji recalled the quickly fading dream. He wasn't sure what he had done to Asuka at the last moment. And it scared him. The thought that he really did have a serious problem clenched his heart like a pincer. It was only natural that no one loved him. Who in the world would like such a mean, selfish, nasty boy? Some people were kind enough to him, but only because they misjudged him. Like Misato, or the Class Rep. They were too kind and naive to see through Shinji's pretense. Deceived without a doubt. It was only a matter of time before Shinji betrayed and hurt them, and in doing so hurt himself too.  
对吧？真嗣回想起那迅速消逝的梦境。他不确定自己在最后一刻对明日香做了什么。这让他感到害怕。意识到自己确实有一个严重的问题，他的心被钳子般紧紧夹住。没有人爱他是理所当然的。世界上有谁会喜欢这样一个刻薄、自私、讨厌的男孩呢？有些人对他很友善，但那只是因为他们误判了他。比如美里，或是班长。他们太过善良和天真，无法看穿真嗣的伪装。毫无疑问地被欺骗了。真嗣背叛并伤害他们是迟早的事，而这样做的同时也会伤害到他自己。

And if you thought about it further, there was no way that a smart girl like Asuka could not see through him. That's probably why she despised him. Of course, everything that happened in that tent was only a dream, but it wasn't too hard to imagine the real Asuka having the same feelings and thoughts about him. And not just Asuka. Father probably knew from early on, too, and that must have been the reason he left him.  
再深入想想，像明日香这样聪明的女孩不可能看不穿他。这大概就是她鄙视他的原因。当然，帐篷里发生的一切都只是梦，但要想象现实中的明日香对他有同样的感受和想法并不难。不只是明日香。父亲可能从一开始就知道，那一定也是他离开他的原因。

Another clatter brought his thoughts to a halt. Shinji lifted himself up, groaning. His eyes turned to the clock on the wall out of habit. 7A.M. Did Misato wake up earlier than usual and start making coffee or something? If that was the case, he had no time to spend lying in bed and thinking nonsense. He needed to prepare breakfast and Asuka's lunch, too.  
又一声响动打断了他的思绪。真嗣撑起身，呻吟着。他的目光习惯性地转向墙上的时钟。早上 7 点。是美里比平时起得更早，开始煮咖啡什么的吗？如果是这样，他可没时间躺在床上胡思乱想了。他得准备早餐，还有明日香的午餐。

_So she can belittle you again?_ a small voice whispered in his heart. He thought about Horaki's words, that all good deeds are rewarded eventually. _She must have been doted on by her mother and father growing up,_ Shinji thought bitterly. No one could be that naive otherwise. There were many things in this world that were never rewarded.  
所以她又能贬低你了？一个细小的声音在他心中低语。他想起了洞木的话，说所有的好事最终都会得到回报。她一定是从小被父母宠坏了，真嗣苦涩地想。否则，没人会那么天真。这世上有很多事情是永远不会得到回报的。

_Ah, as always, you're doing something nice just to be acknowledged for doing it, a_nother voice whispered. He remembered Asuka's words from his dream.  
啊，一如既往，你做这些好事只是为了得到认可，另一个声音低语道。他想起了梦中明日香的话。

He clenched his fists and left the bed. Once he washed his face and started in on the mundane chores that made up his morning routine, he would forget these haunting thoughts. At least for a moment. Or until something bad happened again.  
他紧握双拳，离开了床铺。一旦他洗完脸，开始处理那些构成他早晨例行公事的琐事，他就会暂时忘却这些萦绕心头的思绪。至少在那一刻。或者直到再次发生什么糟糕的事情。

At least he had no shortage of things to do today. Report to Misato's office at headquarters by nine o'clock. She still hadn't told him what kind of punishment she had in mind, but anything would be better than staying at home by himself and brooding over his troubles. The suspension felt like a saving grace at this point, because he wasn't sure he could bear seeing anyone from school or spending most of his time with Asuka right now.  
至少他今天不缺事情做。九点前到总部向美里报告。她还没告诉他打算怎么惩罚他，但任何惩罚都比独自待在家里沉溺于烦恼要好。眼下，停职仿佛是一种救赎，因为他不确定自己能否承受在学校见到任何人，或者大部分时间与明日香相处。

_What about Asuka? Is it possible for her to go to school as if nothing happened? If I were her, would I be able to stomach seeing the boys' faces again?  
明日香呢？她有可能像什么都没发生一样去上学吗？如果我是她，我还能忍受再次看到那些男孩的脸吗？_

_And who are you to worry about her? Worry about yourself, worry about having to stomach the sight of her face,_ Shinji murmured to himself.  
你又是谁，凭什么担心她？担心你自己吧，担心不得不忍受看到她的脸，真嗣喃喃自语。

By the time he got up and opened the door, he was seriously considering packing a lunch box for Asuka before she came out and leaving the house early so he wouldn't have to see her again. It wouldn't be easy, but if he could either skip breakfast or cut corners on either cooking or showering, it didn't sound too impossible. He was considering his options, until he set foot in the kitchen, rubbing his eyes.  
当他起床并打开门时，他认真考虑在明日香出来之前为她准备一个便当盒，然后早点离开家，这样就不用再见到她了。这并不容易，但如果他能跳过早饭或简化做饭或洗澡的步骤，听起来也不是太不可能。他正在权衡选择，直到他走进厨房，揉了揉眼睛。

He rubbed his eyes once again, sure that what he'd just seen was some kind of crazy hallucination or something. But he wasn't mistaken.  
他再次揉了揉眼睛，确信自己刚才看到的肯定是某种疯狂的幻觉之类的东西。但他没有看错。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

The girl's shoulders froze, and she put down the pot she was holding in both hands with a loud clunk. Distantly, Shinji concluded that this was the source of all that clattering he heard earlier. He took in the scene, utterly bewildered. More than half of the cupboards were opened. The cutting board was on the counter, one of his sharper knives lying beside it. On the board there was a carrot, whole save for a huge, jagged chunk missing near the head. There was also a small onion that had lost one or two layers more than necessary. In front of all of it was Asuka, a red apron thrown over the loose T-shirt and shorts she usually wore to sleep in. Shinji looked for his own apron, which hung on one side of the wall. Asuka turned on the gas stove without looking at him. She was turning that one certain knob that always gave Shinji trouble. After the third attempt, Asuka was oozing irritation.  
女孩的肩膀僵住了，她双手捧着的锅重重地放下，发出一声巨响。遥远地，真嗣得出结论，这就是他之前听到的所有叮当声的来源。他环顾四周，完全摸不着头脑。超过一半的橱柜都敞开着。砧板放在台面上，旁边是他的一把锋利刀具。砧板上有一根胡萝卜，除了头部附近缺失了一大块参差不齐的部分外，完好无损。还有一个小洋葱，失去了本不必剥去的一两层皮。这一切面前站着的是明日香，她常穿的宽松 T 恤和短裤外披着一件红色围裙。真嗣寻找着自己的围裙，它挂在墙的一侧。明日香没有看他，就打开了煤气灶。她正在转动那个总是让真嗣头疼的特定旋钮。第三次尝试后，明日香显得越来越不耐烦。

"Asuka… you can just use the next burner. Or maybe press a little harder while turning that -"  
“明日香…你可以用下一个炉头。或者转动时稍微用力一点——”

"Quiet. Don't say anything. Just shut up."  
“闭嘴。什么也别说。就安静点。”

Irritation filled Shinji's heart. The guilt and reservations stemming from last night's dream evaporated all at once and resentment rose to take their place.  
恼怒充斥着真嗣的心。昨晚梦境带来的愧疚和疑虑瞬间蒸发，取而代之的是怨恨。

"Why are you so angry? I'm just trying to help you. You didn't have to react like that!"  
“你为什么这么生气？我只是想帮你。你没必要那样反应！”

Shinji belatedly realized that he had raised his voice. It was an extremely rare occurrence, and usually happened only in Asuka-related cases. She seemed to have a natural talent for drawing Shinji's ire.  
真嗣后知后觉地意识到自己提高了嗓门。这种情况极为罕见，通常只发生在与明日香相关的情况下。她似乎天生就有激怒真嗣的本领。

Asuka viciously twisted her wrist, and the stove finally lit up. At the same time, her head turned towards him with the same speed and ferocity. She bared her teeth while picking up a spoon from the counter and started to stir the pot. A sharp scratching sound followed, making Shinji really worry about the bottom of the pot. Asuka, on the other hand, didn't seem to care at all about it.  
明日香狠狠地扭动手腕，炉火终于点燃。与此同时，她的头以同样的迅猛转向他。她一边龇牙咧嘴，一边从台面上抓起一把勺子开始搅拌锅中的食物。随之而来的是一阵刺耳的刮擦声，让真嗣着实担心起锅底来。而明日香对此似乎毫不在意。

"It's a shame that I owe you this much. Hikari insisted, to the point she forced me to take that bag with those cookbooks and stuff! So. Even though I still think it's a load of crap, I don't like the mere _possibility_ of anyone thinking I owe you _anything,_ so I decided I'd cook my own lunch today - which, by the way, is something YOU'RE supposed to be doing. And then, since I'm already cooking anyway, I thought I'd warm up your stuff too. Here I am, doing all of this work, and look at you. You should be thanking me. But _nooo,_ the moment you clap your dumb eyes on me you _have_ to act all high and mighty and try to teach me how it's done. Be honest! You've always looked down on me, haven't you? Like, _look at this girl, she can't even cook! She's just like Misato!_ There's no other possible reason I can think of for you to be so diligent about preparing my lunch every day. Oh yeah, cooking is totally how you rub your superiority complex all up in my face. Like _ooh look at me I'm so good at this shit, take my mighty bento box and be thankful, peasant._ That's the kind of mindset behind it, right?  
真遗憾我欠你这么多。光坚持要我拿那个装着食谱和东西的袋子，甚至逼我带上！所以，尽管我还是觉得这堆东西纯属胡扯，但我可不想让人以为我欠你什么，于是决定今天自己动手做午饭——顺便说一句，这本该是你做的事。既然我已经在做饭了，我想顺便也帮你热一下。瞧瞧我，忙得不可开交，而你呢，应该感谢我才对。可你倒好，一看到我就摆出一副高高在上的样子，还想教我怎么做。老实说！你一直看不起我，对吧？就像，看看这女孩，连做饭都不会！她跟美里一样！除了这个，我想不出你为什么每天都要这么勤快地给我准备午饭。哦，对了，做饭就是你炫耀优越感的手段吧。就像，哦，看我多厉害，拿着我的强大便当盒，感恩吧，平民。就是这种心态，对吧？

She said all of this very fast. For several long moments, the only sound was the hiss of water from the bathroom and the bubbling of the pots on the stove as Shinji tried to forcibly wrap his spinning head around Asuka's rant. Most of it made no sense whatsoever. What little he did manage to understand was so wrong in so many ways it was almost funny. So Horaki gave her that apron…and some cookbooks? And that stuff in the pot…oh…that must be his leftover congee from yesterday.  
她语速飞快地说完这一切。在漫长的几秒钟里，唯一的声音是浴室里水流的嘶嘶声和炉子上锅中的咕嘟声，真嗣努力试图让自己的思绪跟上明日香的长篇大论。大部分内容他完全摸不着头脑。即便他勉强理解的那一小部分，也错得离谱到近乎滑稽。所以，洞木给了她那条围裙……还有几本烹饪书？而锅里的东西……哦……那肯定是他昨天剩下的粥。

"Honestly," Asuka continued, "I don't even know why I'm doing this. So much for Misato being an adult! That woman can't stop making stuff up every time she opens her mouth. And Hikari, she should never tell me what to do or not to do when she doesn't have a single idea how this place runs. And you, you keep…you're…" Asuka gritted her teeth and picked up the knife. Her eyes remained fixed on him. "Do you have to eat plain congee? Nothing else added? Is carrot off the menu? Even if I chop them up really small?"  
"“说真的，”明日香继续道，“我甚至不知道自己为什么要这么做。米莎自称是大人，真是笑话！那女人每次开口都胡说八道。还有洞木，她根本不懂这里是怎么运作的，就别对我指手画脚了。至于你，你总是……你……”明日香咬紧牙关，拿起刀，目光依旧紧盯着他。“你就非得吃白粥吗？什么都不加？胡萝卜也不行吗？哪怕我切得非常细碎？”

Shinji nodded, because she was looking at him like she wanted a response and _yes_ was always a good one and what the hell was she talking about, again? His brain still hadn't managed to catch up with her words. A moment later, he shook his head as he realized what she was asking.  
真嗣点点头，因为她正盯着他，似乎在等待回应，而“是”总是一个不错的选择，她到底在说什么，又来了？他的大脑还没能跟上她的话语。片刻后，当他意识到她在问什么时，他摇了摇头。

"Ah wait, no. It's alright. I can eat them. Carrots, I mean."  
“啊，等等，不。没关系。我可以吃它们。我是说胡萝卜。”

Asuka frowned, as if there was something dissatisfactory about his answer, and turned her attention to the carrot. She started cutting it into large chunks. What she was doing was more like pressing vertically to brutally sever the thing than actually cutting it. _You don't want to do that,_ he almost said, but considering her reaction to his first attempt at giving advice, he decided to swallow them down. She must have seen something of it on his face, though, because she frowned again and glared at him. "What are you staring at? Don't you have something better to do?"  
明日香皱起眉头，似乎对他的回答有些不满，然后将注意力转向胡萝卜。她开始将它切成大块。她所做的更像是在垂直按压，以一种粗暴的方式将它切断，而不是真正地切它。你不想那样做，他几乎要说出口，但考虑到她对他第一次尝试给出建议的反应，他决定咽下这些话。不过，她一定从他的脸上看出了什么，因为她再次皱眉，瞪了他一眼。“你在看什么？你难道没有更好的事情做吗？”

Shinji swallowed with a dry throat. Something better to do? He kept hearing sounds coming from the bathroom; Misato must be taking a shower. Asuka was filling his usual position in the kitchen. Maybe he should take Asuka's usual seat? Then he realized that he actually did not know what Asuka usually did in the mornings while he was cooking. Did she come out of her room at the last moment? Or did she watch him cook while sitting at the table? He wasn't sure. This was the first time he'd ever really thought about her daily life.  
真嗣干咽了一下。有什么更好的事情可做吗？他一直听到浴室传来的声音；美里一定是在洗澡。明日香正在厨房里占据他平时的位置。也许他应该坐明日香常坐的座位？然后他意识到，他其实并不知道明日香早上在他做饭时通常会做什么。她是最后一刻才从房间出来吗？还是坐在桌边看他做饭？他不确信。这是他第一次真正思考她的日常生活。

Maybe it implied something about him and their relationship, but he had no time to dwell on it because Asuka's sharp voice interrupted him. She was pulling up her apron shoulder strap.  
也许这暗示了他和她之间的关系，但他没有时间深思，因为明日香尖锐的声音打断了他。她正在拉起围裙的肩带。

"I guess that's what men do. Gawk. All of them, except Mr. Kaji. I know I'm pretty! So I get that you beasts can't take your eyes off me, but really, can't you at least be more discreet about it? Or should I be grateful because you're _oh-so-graciously_ just staring and not doing anything worse?" Asuka turned her eyes to Shinji while lifting the knife. "I'm sure those animals we call classmates are very jealous of you. All they have are those pathetic little photos, but you, you get to live with me. Seeing everything. A privilege, yes, a privilege. You must have been so very proud. You probably secretly looked down on those boys. Thinking, _hey, I'm seeing and enjoying things you plebs could only dream about."_  
"我想这就是男人会做的事吧。盯着看。除了加持先生以外，所有人都是这样。我知道我很漂亮！所以我知道你们这些野兽无法把目光从我身上移开，但拜托，你们就不能稍微含蓄一点吗？还是说我应该感激，因为你们如此慷慨地只是盯着看，而不是做出更过分的事？" 明日香一边说着，一边举起刀看向真嗣。"我敢肯定，那些我们称之为同学的动物们一定非常嫉妒你。他们只有那些可怜的小照片，而你，却能和我住在一起。看到一切。这是一种特权，没错，是一种特权。你一定感到非常自豪。你大概在心里偷偷瞧不起那些男生吧。想着，嘿，我看到的和享受的东西，你们这些平民只能做梦罢了。"

_Why is she choosing_ this _topic out of a hundred possible fights,_ Shinji angrily wondered. Did she forget why he got suspended?  
为什么她偏偏选择这个话题，而不是其他一百种可能的争吵，真嗣愤怒地想。她忘了他为什么被停学吗？

"I never did." "我从没忘记。"

Asuka's eyebrows gathered together. "Liar. I know what you think of me."  
明日香的双眉紧锁。“骗子。我知道你是怎么看我的。”

Heat rose in Shinji's face. He couldn't understand why the hell was she choosing to start their day like this. "I've never done that!"  
真嗣的脸颊泛起红晕。他无法理解她为何要选择以这种方式开始新的一天。“我从没那么想过！”

While his answer was delivered in a half-shout, Shinji felt immense shame as he recalled what he usually did during quiet nights in his room or in his dreams. Worse, there was no way out if Asuka decided to bring up that attempted kiss. The mere thought of it suffocated him. Asuka was vindictive enough to weaponize it, he knew that for a fact. What should he do if she did?  
尽管他的回答近乎喊叫，但真嗣回想起自己在寂静的夜晚通常在房间里或梦中做的事情时，感到无比羞愧。更糟糕的是，如果明日香决定提起那个未遂的吻，他无路可逃。光是想到这一点就让他窒息。他知道，明日香足够记仇，足以将其作为武器。如果她真的那么做了，他该怎么办？

Asuka hit the carrot to cut off yet another big, misshapen chunk and showed her teeth. All the while, her eyes were fixed on Shinji, and the fact that she was using the knife without even watching it gave him a secondhand panic attack. Fortunately, she didn't have the chance to bring up the kissing attempt, because as soon as she opened her mouth, the bathroom door opened with a dull crunch.  
明日香将胡萝卜敲向一边，又切下一大块形状不规则的部分，露出了牙齿。她的目光始终锁定在真嗣身上，而她不看刀子就使用的事实让他感到了间接的恐慌。幸运的是，她没有机会提起那个亲吻的尝试，因为她的嘴刚一张开，浴室的门就发出了一声沉闷的嘎吱声，打开了。

"Is that the first thing you kids do in the morning? Fight?"  
“你们这些孩子早上第一件事就是打架吗？”

Shinji stiffened. Just how much did she hear? "Mi, Misato."  
真嗣僵住了。她到底听到了多少？“美，美里小姐。”

"Good morning," Misato said, wiping off the water from her hair, clad only in a towel. Shinji quickly turned away from the sight, face burning. He saw, at the edge of his field of view, Asuka tilting her head sideways.  
"早上好，" 美里一边说着，一边用毛巾擦干头发，身上只裹着一条浴巾。真嗣迅速转过身去，脸颊发烫。他眼角余光瞥见明日香歪着头。

"Are you heading to HQ on your own?" Misato asked. "Or do you want to come with me? In that case, you should hurry up. I have to report earlier today than usual, so I'm going to skip breakfast and leave as soon as I'm done putting on makeup and getting dressed. You don't have much time."  
"你是自己去总部吗？" 美里问道。"还是想跟我一起去？那样的话，你得快点。我今天要比平时早些报到，所以我会跳过早饭，一化完妆穿好衣服就走。你没多少时间了。"

"Okay, I'll speed up." _Means I have about 30 minutes,_ Shinji thought.  
"好的，我会加快速度。" 真嗣心想，这意味着我还有大约 30 分钟。

Misato seemed to not have anything to say to Asuka. She just headed to her room and closed the door. Asuka snorted. She lifted the knife again, her eyes still on Shinji. "Ha, what a perfect -"  
美里似乎对明日香无话可说。她只是走向自己的房间并关上了门。明日香哼了一声。她再次举起刀，目光依旧锁定在真嗣身上。“哈，真是完美——”

"Asuka!" Shinji, gripped by fear again, stepped towards her. _"Please,_ look where you're cutting! You're making ME nervous!"  
“明日香！”真嗣再次被恐惧攫住，向她走去。“拜托，看看你在切什么！你让我也紧张起来了！”

"Don't tell me what to do! Who do you think you are? You're just Idiot Shinji!"  
“别命令我！你以为你是谁？你不过是笨蛋真嗣！”

Shinji realized that he made a mistake. Until a moment ago Asuka was doing dangerous things unthinkingly, as an honest mistake. Now she was going to do the exact same thing consciously, out of spite, because Shinji told her not to. Asuka lifted the knife again, almost slowly, probably as a way to goad him. He wondered what the hell was fundamentally wrong with this girl, chest boiling with frustration.  
真嗣意识到自己犯了个错误。就在刚才，明日香还在无意中做出危险的事情，那是一个诚实的错误。现在，她却要故意去做同样的事情，出于怨恨，因为真嗣告诉她不要这么做。明日香再次举起刀，几乎是慢慢地，可能是一种挑衅的方式。他不知道这个女孩到底哪里出了问题，胸中的挫败感沸腾起来。

"Asuka, ple-" "明日香，请-"

"You're so smug, thinking you know everything because you cooked some lunches for a year or two at best. You know what? Things like this always boil down to natural reflexes. In the end, it's whether or not you can accurately sense and anticipate where your tool is going while it's in your hand. I've seen you enough in PE and in Eva. Your coordination sucks! You have no right to order me around here."  
"你真是自以为是，以为自己什么都懂，不过是因为你做了几年午饭而已。你知道吗？这种事情最终都归结为自然的本能反应。归根结底，就是在你手里的时候，你能否准确地感知和预判工具的去向。我在体育课和 Eva 里已经看够了你。你的协调性太差了！你没有权利在这里命令我。"

Shinji was at the point where he _wanted_ her to cut herself badly so she could learn a lesson. That would be incredibly vindicating. But as the knife began to descend at a dangerous angle again, Shinji surged forward reflexively, grabbing Asuka's left hand and pulling it hard. The knife struck the empty cutting board with a thump.  
真嗣已经到了希望她能狠狠割伤自己，好让她吸取教训的地步。那将会是非常解气的。但当刀子再次以危险的角度下落时，真嗣本能地冲上前去，抓住明日香的左手用力一拉。刀子砰的一声砍在了空无一物的砧板上。

"What are you doing?" Asuka hissed.  
“你在干什么？”明日香低声怒斥。

Shinji took Asuka's fingers and folded them. "Raise them vertically like this, and keep the blade under the knuckle line. That way you won't get cut even if you try. If you're going to chop vegetables without looking, at least keep your fingers like this. Please, please."  
真嗣握住明日香的手指，将它们折叠起来。“像这样竖直举起，让刀刃保持在关节线以下。这样即使你尝试也不会被割伤。如果你打算闭着眼睛切菜，至少要保持手指这样。求你了，求你了。”

He was worried about what he should do if she kept being stubborn. But she remained silent, her mouth closed. A moment later Shinji realized what she was doing: staring at their hands, which were overlapping. His face reddened. He tried to pull his away, but Asuka's quickly came up and snatched it. Now the position was reversed, her hand on top of his. Shinji's palm was awkwardly sandwiched between the cold carrot and Asuka's hot grip.  
他担心如果她继续固执己见，自己该怎么办。但她保持沉默，嘴巴紧闭。片刻后，真嗣意识到她在做什么：盯着他们重叠的手。他的脸红了。他试图抽回手，但明日香迅速伸手抓住了他的手。现在位置颠倒了，她的手压在他的手上。真嗣的手掌尴尬地夹在冰冷的胡萝卜和明日香炽热的握力之间。

Overwhelmed by this totally incomprehensible development, Shinji uttered the first and only thing that came to his mind. "Asuka, if, if Mi, Misato sees this…"  
面对这完全无法理解的发展，真嗣脱口而出脑海中唯一浮现的话。"明日香，如果，如果美里小姐看到这一幕……"

He quickly checked the door of Misato's room as he said that. The loud sound of the hair dryer was coming out from the inside. Asuka, on the other hand, glared at Shinji and Shinji only.  
他说着迅速检查了美里房间的门。里面传来吹风机的轰鸣声。而明日香则瞪着真嗣，只瞪着真嗣。

"If Misato sees this? Then what?"  
"要是美里看到这个怎么办？那又如何？"

Shinji felt himself shrinking inwardly. Asuka was too close. He could smell her sweat from this distance, mixed with her usual fragrant shampoo. It was completely different from the perfume or soap he usually smelled whenever he got this close to her, and he was dumbstruck by the sheer alienness of it. It was so different. Everything was different.  
真嗣感到内心在退缩。明日香靠得太近了。他从这个距离就能闻到她的汗水，混合着她常用的香氛洗发水。这与他通常在她靠近时闻到的香水或肥皂味截然不同，他被这种纯粹的异样感震惊了。一切都不同了。一切都变了。

"She might think we are, we are…"  
"她可能会以为我们在，我们在……"

Asuka's neck trembled slightly. "We are…?"  
明日香的脖子微微颤抖。“我们是……？”

_She might think we are in a relationship or something,_ he couldn't say. "We are…"  
她可能以为我们在交往什么的，他无法说出口。“我们是……”

Asuka turned her gaze to the cutting board. She stared at it as if it was the most interesting thing in the world. Shinji tried to pull his hand out again, but Asuka wouldn't let him go. A very strained silence fell. It was Asuka who broke it first.  
明日香将目光转向砧板。她盯着它，仿佛那是世界上最有趣的东西。真嗣再次试图抽出手，但明日香不让他走。一阵非常紧张的沉默降临。最终是明日香率先打破了沉默。

"Do you want to?" "你想去吗？"

"What?" "什么？"

Shinji looked at Asuka in surprise, and she returned his gaze with narrowed eyes. She was taller than him by only a few centimeters at best, but at this moment he felt like he was looking up at Father. It was impossible to bear her silent gaze for too long, so he gulped and turned to the sink. All the strange things that had happened last week and what Horaki said to him passed through his mind, but Shinji pushed all of it to a dark corner. Pointless, stupid, one-sided hopes born of his imagination running wild, that if pursued would inevitably result in disappointment for him and pain for everyone else.  
真嗣惊讶地看着明日香，她也眯起眼睛回望着他。她只比他高几厘米，但此刻他感觉自己像是在仰视父亲。她的沉默凝视让人难以承受太久，于是他咽了口唾沫，转向水槽。上周发生的所有奇怪事情以及班长对他说的话在他脑海中闪过，但真嗣把这些都推到了一个黑暗的角落。这些无意义的、愚蠢的、单方面的希望，都是他狂野想象中的产物，如果追求下去，只会导致他自己的失望和给其他人带来痛苦。

"Oh, no!" Shinji blurted. "Of course not! How…I mean…"  
"哦，不！"真嗣脱口而出。"当然不想！怎么……我是说……"

Asuka's hand squeezed his in a sudden surge of strength. Shinji realized he wasn't tactful enough. "I mean, um, I don't know…"  
明日香的手突然用力握紧他的手，一股力量涌来。真嗣意识到自己不够圆滑。“我是说，呃，我不知道……”

"You mean you don't like me, is that it?"  
“你是说你不喜欢我，是吗？”

Shinji despaired. _This is all Kensuke's fault,_ he thought. Asuka must have gotten so mad because of Kensuke and decided to take it all out on him because he was closest. That was the only possible explanation. Her recent actions were too irrational and nonsensical even by her usual standards for it to be otherwise. This was literally a trap she was hounding him into.  
真嗣感到绝望。这一切都是健介的错，他想。明日香一定是被健介气疯了，决定把气都撒在他身上，因为他离得最近。这是唯一的解释。她最近的行为太不合逻辑，甚至超出了她平时的标准，不可能有其他原因。这简直就是她设下的陷阱，逼他跳进去。

"Well, not exactly…" “呃，不完全是……”

The sound of the hair dryer stopped, making Shinji's anxiety skyrocket. Asuka's hand stiffened too, making Shinji's finger almost dig into the carrot.  
吹风机的声音停止了，这让真嗣的焦虑直线上升。明日香的手也僵硬了，使得真嗣的手指几乎要插进胡萝卜里。

"Shinji." "真嗣。"

Her voice was low. Shinji swallowed nervously, fearing what would follow. Asuka lowered her head slightly.  
她的声音很低。真嗣紧张地咽了咽口水，害怕接下来会发生什么。明日香微微低下头。

"This is the only time I'm telling you this, so listen carefully."  
“这是我唯一一次告诉你这件事，所以仔细听好。”

Shinji nodded weakly. Asuka glanced sideways at him and returned her gaze to the cutting board. "I hate vague or confusing things. I really hate them. And I think I already passed the limit of my patience a long time ago. Honestly, I'm being way too generous. So I'll just say it once: if you want to pretend to be close to me, I'm willing to go along. If you're not, just tell me. I'm fine either way. I don't care. The deadline is today."  
真嗣无力地点了点头。明日香斜眼瞥了他一下，又将目光转回砧板。“我讨厌含糊不清或令人困惑的事情。真的很讨厌。而且我觉得自己很久以前就已经忍耐到了极限。老实说，我太过宽容了。所以我就说一次：如果你想假装亲近我，我愿意配合。如果你不想，就直接告诉我。我无所谓。我不在乎。截止日期是今天。”

_What the hell are you talking about?_ Shinji wanted to ask her. The ridiculous, shameless desires that dominated his fantasies bloomed in the forefront of his reality. _She's asking you to be her boyfriend!_ they shouted. _You can't let this chance escape!_  
“你到底在说什么？”真嗣想问她。那些荒谬无耻的欲望主宰着他的幻想，在他的现实中盛开。“她在问你愿不愿意做她男朋友！”它们喊道。“你不能让这个机会溜走！”

_That's crazy!_ his rational mind yelled back. _You must've already picked out our grandchildrens' names, how about sharing them so she can have a good laugh?! Or slap us silly!_  
这太疯狂了！他的理智在内心反驳。你肯定连我们孙子的名字都挑好了吧，不如分享出来让她好好笑一场？或者干脆把我们打傻！

Overwhelmed, all Shinji could do was nod his head, not even fully realizing what he was agreeing to.  
被压得喘不过气来，真嗣只能点头，甚至没完全意识到自己同意了什么。

By the time Misato came out of her room, Shinji was sitting at the kitchen table, already washed and clothed in his school uniform, with a lunch box ready on the table in front of him. He stared at it blankly. Asuka, at that point, had already returned to her room, nowhere to be seen.  
当美里走出房间时，真嗣已经坐在厨房的餐桌旁，洗漱完毕并换上了校服，桌上还准备好了便当盒。他茫然地盯着它。那时，明日香已经回到了自己的房间，不见踪影。

A/N: Okay, I got some things to unpack because of a variety of reasons.  
作者注：好吧，有些事情我得解释一下，原因有很多。

1) After some conversations with certain people I feel like I should clarify this a bit. What Shinji thinks of himself is not a totally accurate reality of Shinji, just like Asuka's image of herself is not totally accurate. I do think some selfish and almost dangerous streak of his mind is a real thing, though. Some fics tend to make him a total doormat or an innocent angel or something and I do not agree with such interpretations.  
1) 在与一些人交谈后，我觉得有必要澄清一下。真嗣对自己的看法并不完全准确，就像明日香对自己的看法也不完全准确一样。不过，我认为他内心确实存在一些自私甚至危险的倾向。有些同人文倾向于把他描绘成一个完全的受气包或无辜的天使之类，我并不认同这种解读。

2) I know I'm veering dangerously close to edgefest with Kensuke stuff, please think of it as Shinji's hormone-riddled, possessive mind projecting itself in the ugliest form  
2) 我知道我在肯斯克的事情上有点接近边缘，请把它看作是真嗣充满荷尔蒙、占有欲极强的内心以最丑陋的形式投射出来的结果。

3) With many things including a family trip planned by the end of the year I'm not sure I could update as frequently as I did for several recent chapters. I'll try my best.  
3) 年底前计划了许多事情，包括家庭旅行，我不确定能否像最近几章那样频繁更新。我会尽力的。

4) The last bit of this chapter was one of the few scenes that were there from the earliest draft. Because...  
4) 本章的最后一部分是早期草稿中保留至今的少数场景之一。因为...

5) Story time. 100% real story, trust me. Back when I was 17, there was this girl in our class, very pretty, not the top-of-the-grade kind of pretty but definitely on top 5. Very loud and obnoxious, though, and she had mean names for everyone. And the meanest of them was mine, '고자(Go-ja)', which means, in English, a sexually impotent, neutered, castrated, eunuch. I wasn't even angry, more like extremely dumbfounded by this uncalled-for nickname, as you could easily imagine. I still don't even know why she picked that word. I tried my damnest best to avoid her, because a mere encounter with her meant a small-scale scandal(imagine a high-pitched girl's voice ringing in the busy corridor shouting that specific profanity) or even potential trouble with teachers. Aaaaand few months passed like that and there was this one time, in early summer, when she found me in a quiet backside corridor, alone. She was so uncharacteristically serious and quiet that moment, saying 'hey, impotent, I'm willing to go along if you want to pretend we're friends.' I was like, 'oh, okay.' Name-calling, and just her calling me in general, stopped from that day.  
5) 故事时间。百分百真实故事，相信我。在我 17 岁那年，班上有个女孩，非常漂亮，不是那种年级顶尖的美，但绝对能排进前五。不过她非常吵闹且讨人厌，对每个人都起恶毒的绰号。其中最恶毒的就是给我的，'고자(Go-ja)'，在英语中意为性无能、阉割、去势的太监。我并没有生气，更多的是对这个突如其来的绰号感到极度无语，你很容易想象得到。我至今也不明白她为何选了这个词。我尽全力避开她，因为仅仅遇到她一次就意味着会引发小规模丑闻（想象一下在繁忙的走廊里，一个尖锐的女孩声音大喊那个脏话），甚至可能招致老师的麻烦。就这样过了几个月，有一次初夏时节，她在一条安静的后廊找到了独自一人的我。她那次异常严肃安静，说：“嘿，性无能的，如果你想假装我们是朋友，我愿意配合。”我当时心想，“哦，好吧。”从那天起，她不再给我起绰号，也不再叫我。

### Chapter 8 We will

He was sure now. The Angel was close. Misato's rough estimation that it would pass near this point turned out to be correct.  
他现在确信无疑。天使就在附近。美里粗略估计它会经过这一带，结果证明是正确的。

He hardly felt the vibration of the entry plug at first. Maybe because the source was still too far away. Or maybe because the LCL was working as a stabilizer and neutralizing the external shock. Or maybe because his body, which was still not in the best condition, didn't register the sensation well enough. Whatever the reason was, Shinji realized something was off only after it became very clear.  
起初，他几乎感觉不到插入栓的震动。或许是因为源头还太远。又或许是因为 LCL 起到了稳定器的作用，中和了外界的冲击。再或许是因为他的身体状况尚未完全恢复，未能充分感知到这种震动。无论原因是什么，直到情况变得非常明显，真嗣才意识到有些不对劲。

Before this realization, while waiting at the end of the side maintenance tunnel of the vertical ventilation shaft, Shinji was engulfed in the familiar things he felt every time he piloted Evangelion. Those weird and contradictory feelings.  
在这之前，当真嗣在垂直通风井的侧维护隧道尽头等待时，他沉浸在每次驾驶 EVA 时都会感受到的熟悉感觉中。那些奇怪而矛盾的情绪。

He felt comfortable, almost like he might feel in his own home, while at the same time sensing a cold hostility he couldn't really describe with words. He felt a warmth akin to that of soaking in a hot bath, while also feeling a deadly cold that seeped through his gums. All five senses, sharpening at once, only to be dulled the next moment, repeatedly. Feeling both the vastness of his body and the smallness of it. A strange presence constantly in the back of his consciousness, sometimes nearby, sometimes far away.  
他感到舒适，几乎就像在自己家里可能感受到的那样，同时又感觉到一种难以用言语形容的冰冷敌意。他感受到泡在热水澡中的温暖，同时也感受到一种致命的寒冷渗透进牙龈。五感同时变得敏锐，下一刻又变得迟钝，反复无常。既感受到身体的广阔，又感受到它的渺小。一种奇怪的存在始终在意识背后，时而近在咫尺，时而远在天边。

And loneliness. Loneliness.  
还有孤独。孤独。

In all his previous sorties, between all the hectic radio chatter, flickering HUDs (which he was still not quite sure how to read), urgent instructions from the command center, and the enemy's movements, he still felt that certain loneliness that permeated the entry plug like background noise. Now, there was only silence. Only darkness. Misato's voice didn't erupt from the comm. There was no target in sight. His Eva crouched, alone, in conservation mode, and Shinji waited in the entry plug with only the low electronic buzzing of his Eva for company. It was then that the loneliness rose to the forefront and gripped Shinji's mind like a vise.  
在他之前的所有出击中，尽管充斥着繁忙的无线电通讯、闪烁的 HUD（他仍然不太确定如何解读）、指挥中心的紧急指令以及敌人的动向，他依然能感受到那种如同背景噪音般渗透进插入栓的孤独感。如今，只剩下寂静。只有黑暗。美里小姐的声音没有从通讯器中爆发出来。视野中没有目标。他的 EVA 蹲伏着，处于节能模式，而真嗣在插入栓中等待，只有 EVA 低沉的电子嗡鸣声作伴。就在这时，孤独感升至心头，紧紧抓住了真嗣的思绪，如同一把钳子。

Shinji's thoughts, naturally, went to the whereabouts of Ayanami and Asuka. He would have felt more at ease if they were around.  
自然而然，真嗣的思绪转向了绫波和明日香的行踪。如果她们在身边，他会感到更加安心。

But the notion weirded him out after further consideration. Misato, Ayanami, and Asuka. Shinji had no reason to feel at ease with them. He had known each of them for less than a year and never had a heartfelt exchange or anything like one with any of them. The entirety of his relationship with each was superficial. He was sure they would forget about him after a month or two at best if he were to suddenly disappear. It was just that he'd become so used to Misato's kindness, Ayanami's calmness, and Asuka's overwhelming presence that he started to unilaterally hope for their help whenever it suited him. They were not close to him, nor was he to them.  
但仔细一想，这个念头让他感到怪异。美里、绫波和明日香。真嗣没有理由对他们感到自在。他认识他们每个人还不到一年，从未与他们中的任何一个有过真心交流，甚至类似的情况也没有。他与每个人的关系都浮于表面。他确信，如果他突然消失，他们最多一两个月就会忘记他。只是他已经习惯了美里的善良、绫波的冷静和明日香压倒性的存在感，以至于每当适合的时候，他就开始单方面地希望得到他们的帮助。他们与他并不亲近，他也不与他们亲近。

He had no one he could call that he was close to.  
他没有一个人可以称之为亲近的朋友。

_If you want to pretend to be close to me, I'm willing to go along._ Shinji recalled Asuka's weird words once again. One word in particular grabbed Shinji and didn't let go for most of the time he spent at the headquarters today. Especially after the disastrous encounter with Father. And the more he thought about that word, the more frustrated he became. It wasn't because he didn't understand what it meant. By the time he arrived at headquarters in Misato's car, Shinji had managed to come to a sort of conclusion as to what Asuka meant by 'pretending'. What he couldn't get a grip on, and what was driving him crazy, was the true intent behind Asuka's deceptively simple words, and what he should do about it.  
如果你想假装亲近我，我愿意配合。真嗣再次回想起明日香那些奇怪的话。其中有一个词特别抓住了真嗣，让他今天在总部的大部分时间里都无法释怀。尤其是在与父亲那场灾难性的遭遇之后。他越是思考这个词，就越感到沮丧。这并不是因为他不明白它的意思。当他在美里小姐的车上抵达总部时，真嗣已经设法对明日香所说的“假装”有了某种结论。他无法把握，并且让他发疯的是，明日香那些看似简单的话语背后的真正意图，以及他应该如何应对。

Or if any hidden intent existed at all.  
或者是否存在任何隐藏的意图。

Shinji shook his head and focused on the vibration of the command suite. He had a more urgent duty now and could not afford to be distracted by such silly things. Every single one of his sorties was a huge crisis on its own, but this time the situation was more dire than usual. Today was as bad as his first sortie, that disastrous battle where he didn't even know how to make Eva walk. The entire base had lost power, making it impossible to receive any communications, arms support, or power supply. With all the external batteries attached to the shoulders, Unit-01 had 8 minutes and 24 seconds of power left. Deploying his AT field and moving fast would burn power more quickly, so he had to take that into account, too. And he didn't know where Asuka and Ayanami were by now, or whether they had made it to headquarters in the first place. It was clear he couldn't just sit and wait.  
真嗣摇了摇头，将注意力集中在指挥舱的震动上。眼下他有更紧迫的任务，无暇被这些琐事分心。每一次出击对他而言都是一场巨大的危机，但这次的情况比往常更为严峻。今日之险境堪比他初次出击的那场灾难性战斗，那时他甚至不知如何让 Eva 行走。整个基地已断电，导致无法接收任何通讯、武器支援或电力补给。肩负所有外接电池的 01 号机仅剩 8 分 24 秒的电量。展开 AT 力场并高速移动会更快耗电，他也必须考虑在内。至于明日香和绫波丽如今身在何处，是否已抵达总部，他一无所知。显然，他不能坐以待毙。

The shaking grew bigger and bigger. The Angel was close now. But when he checked the HUD, there was no change in the augmented reality projected on the LCL in front of him. He looked down at the buttons on his command yoke. Active sonar was included in all the non-critical functions he'd suspended according to instructions given by a loudspeaker-holding Ibuki right before the launch. They'd told him how to turn some of them back on in the case of engagement, but now that he was sitting here alone he couldn't remember what buttons he had to push to do so. He didn't feel like pressing random buttons. And even if he did somehow manage to turn it on, he wasn't sure if sonar would be useful in the narrow tunnel he was in.  
震动越来越剧烈。使徒已经近在咫尺。然而当他查看 HUD 时，眼前 LCL 中投射的增强现实并未有任何变化。他低头看向操纵杆上的按钮。根据发射前手持扩音器的伊吹给出的指示，他已暂停了包括主动声纳在内的所有非关键功能。他们曾告诉他如何在遭遇战时重新启用其中一些功能，但此刻独自坐在这里，他却记不清该按哪些按钮了。他不想随意乱按。即便他侥幸开启了声纳，也不确定在如此狭窄的隧道中它是否能派上用场。

_If Asuka was here, she would have already figured out the Angel's position and come up with a way to deal with it,_ Shinji thought.  
如果明日香在这里，她肯定已经找出了使徒的位置并想出了应对之策，真嗣心想。

Shinji clenched his teeth. Sticky LCL ran through his molars. He was thinking about Asuka again. The redhead seemed to dominate Shinji's headspace to an absurd degree, especially considering that he hadn't known her for very long. For a while there, he thought he was adjusting somewhat to his new life as an Eva pilot, but then she showed up and completely rearranged the parameters. Everything had changed. She quite literally turned his room - her room now - upside down. She was so loud and eye-catching and even in her absence she was able to keep his attention through the crazy, confusing things she said.  
真嗣紧咬着牙关。黏稠的 LCL 液体从他的臼齿间流过。他又在想明日香了。这位红发少女似乎以一种荒谬的程度占据了真嗣的思绪，尤其是考虑到他认识她并不久。有一段时间，他以为自己多少适应了作为 EVA 驾驶员的新生活，但随后她出现了，彻底改变了局面。一切都变了。她简直把他的房间——现在成了她的房间——翻了个底朝天。她如此吵闹、引人注目，即便不在场，也能通过她那些疯狂而令人困惑的话语吸引他的注意。

Most of his problems were all her fault, but somehow he couldn't make himself blame Asuka too much. So Shinji whispered the next name that came to his mind. Misato. Yes, this was Misato's fault for forcing two unrelated teenagers of the opposite sex to live together under the same roof. However, as with Asuka, he couldn't blame Misato very much either. It wasn't Misato's fault that Shinji failed to get along with his partner and had to go through special training to attempt to remedy it. To this day, he didn't understand why Asuka stayed in his house even after the training.  
他的大多数问题都是她的错，但不知为何，他就是无法让自己过多地责怪明日香。于是真嗣低声念出了脑海中浮现的下一个名字。美里。是的，这都是美里的错，她强迫两个性别不同、毫无关系的青少年同住一个屋檐下。然而，与明日香一样，他也无法过多地责怪美里。并不是美里的错，真嗣没能与搭档相处融洽，不得不接受特殊训练来试图改善这一点。时至今日，他仍不明白为何明日香在训练结束后还留在他家。

His house. Now that was a strange way to put it. Because it wasn't his house. Only then did Shinji realize the root of all these problems. The fundamental reason why Shinji was living in a stranger's house with people he had never met before.  
他的房子。这么说真是奇怪。因为那并不是他的房子。直到这时，真嗣才意识到所有这些问题的根源。根本原因在于，真嗣正与一群素未谋面的人住在陌生人的房子里。

Father. 父亲。

Shinji recalled the two encounters with his father he had today. Getting humiliated in front of his office. Getting completely and totally ignored in the hangar.  
真嗣回想起今天与父亲的两段遭遇。在办公室前被羞辱。在机库中被彻底无视。

Shinji's heart pounded. He hated his father. So much.  
真嗣的心怦怦直跳。他恨他的父亲。非常恨。

But now, as he held the noticeably vibrating command yoke and calmed his breathing, something pathetic and contemptible was undeniably growing in the corner of his heart. And because of that very part, Shinji clenched his teeth hard and willed his Eva to crawl forward.  
但现在，当他握着明显在震动的操纵杆并平复呼吸时，一种可怜又可鄙的情绪无疑在他心的一角悄然滋生。正因为那一部分，真嗣紧咬牙关，命令他的 Eva 向前爬行。

---

_7 hours before the Tokyo-3 blackout - morning.  
东京-3 大停电前 7 小时 - 早晨。_

"Ms. Misato, where do I put this?"  
“美里小姐，这个放哪儿？”

"Cabinet by the door," Misato replied, typing on the keyboard without taking her eyes off the monitor. She didn't even seem to be curious about what Shinji was putting away. Without a word, Shinji walked toward the door of Misato's office, carrying four black files in his arms. They were not all that heavy despite their bulk (each one of them was over two times thicker than Shinji's fist). Shinji, with his rather small frame, was having a hard time controlling them. When he opened the cabinet door with one hand, they slipped out of his arms and spilled on the floor.  
“门口的柜子，”美里回答道，手指在键盘上飞舞，眼睛始终没有离开显示器。她似乎对真嗣要放的东西毫不关心。真嗣一言不发，抱着四本黑色文件夹走向美里办公室的门口。尽管体积庞大（每本都比真嗣的拳头厚两倍多），它们并不算太重。身材瘦小的真嗣费力地控制着它们。当他用一只手打开柜门时，文件夹从他怀里滑落，散落一地。

"Be more careful, would you?"  
“小心点，好吗？”

Misato's glance came and went. Shinji started to pick up the files, all of them wide open. When he bent and squatted down, he felt dizzy for a moment. While clenching his fists and trying to keep his balance, he noticed the words on the file spread out in front of him. It was a cover for some kind of report, large black letters on a white background.  
美里瞥了一眼便移开了目光。真嗣开始捡起散落一地的文件，每一份都摊开着。当他弯腰蹲下时，感到一阵眩晕。他紧握双拳，努力保持平衡，这时注意到了摊开在他面前的文件上的文字。这是一份报告的封面，白色背景上印着醒目的大黑字。

**AFTER-ACTION REVIEW 战后评估报告**

**UNIT-01 PILOT SHINJI IKARI  
初号机驾驶员 碇真嗣**

**SIXTH ANGEL 第六使徒**

**OPERATIONS DIRECTOR M. KATSURAGI  
作战部长 摩·葛城**

This must be Misato's evaluation. Probably read by Father. No, certainly read by Father. Now that he thought about it, it was only natural that such a thing existed, but it was so jarring to see it with his own eyes.  
这一定是美里小姐的评估报告。大概是被父亲读过了。不，肯定被父亲读过了。现在想来，这样的东西存在是理所当然的，但亲眼看到还是让人感到震惊。

Shinji turned his head slightly to check on Misato, who was still sitting at the desk. After arriving at the office and spending the first few minutes directing the cleaning effort Shinji was conscripted into, she was now busy with her computer, not paying much attention to him anymore. Shinji swallowed and looked down again at the file before him.  
真嗣微微侧头，查看了一下美里，她依旧坐在桌前。抵达办公室并花了最初几分钟指导真嗣被征召参与的清洁工作后，她现在正忙于电脑，不再过多关注他。真嗣咽了口唾沫，再次低头看向面前的文件。

What would be in there? What did Misato have to say about him in a place where he couldn't hear or read? Shinji became curious. All he had to do was reach out and turn the page over.  
那里会有什么？美里在他无法听到或阅读的地方会如何评价他？真嗣的好奇心被勾起。他只需伸手翻过那一页。

Then he realized that he didn't want to. He was still curious, but he didn't want to check. He didn't want to know. He gathered the files and stood up with them in his arms. He heard a loud click from Misato's desk.  
随即他意识到自己并不想这么做。他依然好奇，但他不想去查看。他不想知道。他整理好文件，抱着它们站起身来。他听到美里桌上传来一声清脆的点击声。

"Is that shelf full? Then put them here."  
“那个架子满了？那就放这儿吧。”

Shinji flinched and turned to Misato. Misato remained fixated on the monitor, typing with one hand, and opening the drawer under her desk with the other. Shinji cleared his throat. There was a single empty can of beer rolling forlornly around inside and nothing else. He took it out and put the black files in their place. When he straightened up, Misato closed the drawer with a clink.  
真嗣缩了缩身子，转向美里。美里依旧盯着屏幕，一只手打字，另一只手拉开桌下的抽屉。真嗣清了清嗓子。抽屉里只有一罐孤零零滚来滚去的空啤酒罐，别无他物。他取出空罐，将黑色文件放了进去。当他站直身子时，美里“咔嗒”一声关上了抽屉。

Shinji put the can in a garbage bag leaning against one wall, thought for a moment, and tied the bag. It wasn't quite full yet, but he had a hunch that if he didn't throw it away now it would take weeks for Misato to deal with it. He'd already thrown out one garbage bag, which had been, predictably, overflowing a ghastly amount. He wrinkled his nose at the remembered stink of it.  
真嗣把罐子放进靠在墙边的垃圾袋里，想了一会儿，然后系紧了袋子。虽然还没装满，但他有种预感，如果现在不扔掉，美里可能要等上几周才会处理。他已经扔掉了一袋垃圾，那袋子满得吓人，臭气熏天，让他至今记忆犹新，不禁皱了皱鼻子。

"I think I'm done. I'll go ahead and throw the bag away."  
“我想我已经弄完了。我这就去把袋子扔掉。”

Misato stopped typing, checked the clock on the opposite wall, and looked around the office. "That was quick. Good work, Shinji."  
美里停下打字，看了看对面墙上的时钟，又环顾了一下办公室。“这么快就搞定了。干得好，真嗣。”

Shinji picked up the garbage bag, then put it down again to walk to Misato's desk. He almost forgot one thing.  
真嗣拿起垃圾袋，随即又放下，走向美里的办公桌。他差点忘了件事。

"I'll go wash this, too."  
"我也去洗洗这个。"

Shinji pulled the coffee pot out of the maker. It was so stained with dark residue that the glass was rendered opaque. Shinji grimaced. Misato raised her eyebrows.  
真嗣从咖啡机里拿出咖啡壶。壶上沾满了深色的残渣，玻璃都变得不透明了。真嗣皱了皱眉。美里挑起了眉毛。

"Why?" “为什么？”

Shinji had to suppress a groan. "What do you mean, why?"  
真嗣不得不压下呻吟。“什么意思，为什么？”

"I never saw anyone wash coffee pots."  
"我从没见过有人洗咖啡壶。"

"I wash the one back at home every day."  
"我家里那个每天都会洗。"

"Really? I didn't know that. Huh."  
"真的吗？我之前不知道。嗯。"

"Yeah, really. When was the last time you washed this?"  
“是啊，真的。你上次洗这个是什么时候？”

Misato shrugged and made a noncommittal noise. "Don't remember. What's the big deal? It's just coffee."  
美里耸了耸肩，发出一个模棱两可的声音。“不记得了。有什么大不了的？只是咖啡而已。”

There were a few issues in this world on which Shinji Ikari would brook no compromise, and this was one of them. He fixed his guardian with a flat look.  
在这个世界上，有几个问题是碇真嗣绝不让步的，这就是其中之一。他用平静的目光盯着他的监护人。

"Ms. Misato, maybe you don't realize since it's not in the name, but coffee is basically water that's pressed through crushed beans. Would you drink out of something that had bean juice residue on the bottom of it for months?"  
“美里小姐，也许您没意识到，因为名字里没体现出来，但咖啡基本上就是通过碾碎的豆子压榨出来的水。您会愿意喝那些底部残留着几个月豆汁的杯子吗？”

Misato flinched, then laughed a moment later. "You're right. You surprised me, Shinji. Heh."  
美里微微一缩，随即笑了起来。“你说得对。真没想到，真嗣，呵呵。”

_What does that even mean?_ "What?"  
那到底是什么意思？“什么？”

Misato turned back to the monitor without a word with a rather pleased look on face, waving her hand. Shinji turned around with a snort and picked up the garbage bag on his way out.  
美里一言不发地转回监视器前，脸上带着颇为得意的表情，挥了挥手。真嗣哼了一声，转身离开时顺手拿起了垃圾袋。

By the time Shinji returned, having shoved the bag into a trash can on the other side of the hall and scrubbed the pot in the bathroom sink with some paper towels and his fingernails, Misato was standing in front of the mirror, dressed in her red coat, checking her beret.  
当真嗣回来时，他已经把垃圾袋塞进了大厅另一头的垃圾桶，并用纸巾和指甲在浴室水槽里刷洗了锅子，美里正站在镜子前，穿着她的红色外套，检查着贝雷帽。

"Are you going somewhere?"  
“你要去哪儿？”

Misato turned her eyes to Shinji in the mirror and nodded. "Yeah, I have to go see the Commander. Face-to-face report."  
美里透过镜子看向真嗣，点了点头。“嗯，我得去见司令。当面汇报。”

"Oh."

Stepping lightly, Misato turned to Shinji.  
美里轻快地转身面对真嗣。

"It won't take long. Wait here. I'll come up with the next disciplinary measure before I come back. If anyone visits in the meantime, be sure to kick them out, okay?"  
“不会太久的。你在这里等我。我回来之前会想好下一个惩戒措施。如果期间有人来访，一定要把他们赶走，好吗？”

Before Shinji could answer, Misato brushed past him. He hurriedly put the coffee pot down on the desk and followed her. The automatic door, which was about to close, stopped in the middle and opened again.  
在真嗣能回答之前，美里擦身而过。他急忙将咖啡壶放在桌上，紧随其后。那扇即将关闭的自动门在半途停下，又重新打开了。

Misato looked back, tilting her head. "What?"  
美里回头，歪着头问：“怎么了？”

"I, I want to see Father, too. I, well, I have, uh, business, with him."  
“我，我也想见父亲。我，呃，我有些，嗯，事情要和他谈。”

At first it was an impulsive decision. But by the time he finished stuttering, his will became stronger than ever. Now that he was at headquarters for the first time since the last operation, he was attracted to the idea of talking to his father like moths were attracted to light.  
起初这只是个冲动的决定。但当他结结巴巴地说完后，他的意志变得比以往任何时候都要坚定。自从上次行动以来，他第一次来到总部，他发现自己被与父亲交谈的想法所吸引，就像飞蛾被灯光吸引一样。

Misato's eyes widened slightly. "Really? Would it take long?"  
美里微微睁大了眼睛。"真的吗？会很长时间吗？"

"Eh, no, I don't think so."  
“呃，不，我觉得不会。”

Misato began to study his face, making him blush and lower his head. After a moment, Misato nodded. "Alright. Let's go to his office together."  
美里开始仔细打量他的脸，让他脸红并低下头。过了一会儿，美里点点头。“好吧。我们一起去他的办公室。”

They turned a few corners and arrived at the elevator platform, and remained silent until the elevator arrived and the door opened. Shinji didn't want to say anything, and Misato didn't seem to either. Only after the floor marker started to click in the heavy silence did she open her mouth again.  
他们转了几个弯，来到了电梯平台，一路上保持沉默，直到电梯到达并开门。真嗣不想说什么，美里似乎也没有开口的意思。只有在沉重的寂静中，楼层指示灯开始咔嗒作响时，她才再次开口。

"So, what did you and Asuka talk about this morning?" Her voice was light and curiously pleasant. "She's the one who cooked the lunch you brought today, right? Will you show it to me later?"  
“那么，你和明日香今天早上聊了些什么？”她的声音轻快而充满好奇。“今天的午餐是她做的，对吧？待会儿能给我看看吗？”

Shinji shrugged his shoulders. He'd been struggling hard to push all Asuka-related thoughts out of his mind, but now Misato's questions dragged them back. He was a little annoyed at her for doing this.  
真嗣耸了耸肩。他一直在努力将所有与明日香相关的念头赶出脑海，但如今美里的问题又将它们拉了回来。他对此感到有些恼火。

"Nothing. No, I mean…" Shinji thought for a moment, but Asuka's ultimatum was not the kind of thing he could confide to Misato. He himself was still not sure how to deal with it anyway. "We talked, yes, but not about anything much. My lunch is just leftovers from yesterday. All she did was put some extra ingredients in and boil it. And, yeah, I'll show you later."  
“没什么。不，我是说……”真嗣想了一会儿，但明日香的最后通牒可不是那种能向美里倾诉的事情。他自己也还没弄清楚该如何应对。“我们聊了聊，不过没谈什么重要的事。我的午饭只是昨天的剩菜。她只是加了些额外的食材然后煮了一下。对了，我晚点会给你看的。”

Shinji turned his head forward, blushing. He kept his eyes on the floor marker, but he could still see Misato smiling in his peripheral vision. He started to fear what kind of mean words she would use to tease him.  
真嗣转过头，脸颊泛红。他盯着地板上的标记，但仍能从眼角余光中看到美里在微笑。他开始担心她会用什么刻薄的话来取笑他。

Fortunately for him, what Misato said when she opened her mouth was simpler than he expected.  
幸运的是，当美里开口时，她所说的话比他预想的要简单。

"Don't do anything you'll regret later. That's the only advice I can give to you kids."  
“别做任何你以后会后悔的事。这是我唯一能给你们的忠告。”

He almost wanted to laugh. That was the kind of 'wisdom' that anyone could say and feel smart afterwards. Of course, her words themselves weren't particularly funny. The opposite, actually. She meant well. But what she didn't know was the fact that he was doing his damndest every single day to avoid doing something that he would later regret. It had become a familiar part of his routine - almost like second nature at this point. Just like not reading an after-action report about his fight, even though it was right there in front of him  
他几乎想笑出声来。那种‘智慧’谁都能说出口，事后还觉得自己挺聪明。当然，她的话本身并不特别有趣。实际上，恰恰相反。她是出于好意。但她不知道的是，他每天都在竭尽全力避免做出日后会后悔的事。这已经成为他日常生活的一部分——几乎到了习以为常的地步。就像他不会去读关于自己战斗的战后报告，即使那份报告就摆在他面前一样。

Asuka's most recent request contained the likelihood of causing him catastrophic levels of regret, which Shinji wanted to avoid at all costs. _Don't worry, Misato. I'm trying my best to not do anything stupid._ He knew he couldn't say that out loud, though.  
明日香最近的请求让他极有可能陷入无法挽回的悔恨之中，这是真嗣不惜一切代价想要避免的。别担心，美里。我正在尽力不做任何蠢事。不过，他知道这些话不能大声说出来。

So he replied meekly, as he always did whenever he was offered such clueless kindness. "Yes."  
因此，他像往常一样怯懦地回答，每当面对这种无知的善意时，他总是如此。“是的。”

Maybe his voice was too blatantly unenthusiastic, or maybe Misato felt like digging deeper today. In any case, she seemed to have no intention of accepting such a non-response.  
或许是他的声音过于明显地缺乏热情，又或许是美里今天想要深入探究。无论如何，她似乎没有接受这种敷衍了事的意图。

"Shinji, I'm serious. You shouldn't run away."  
"真嗣，我是认真的。你不应该逃跑。"

This time Shinji just nodded without answering. Misato clicked her tongue. "Sulking again."  
这次真嗣只是点了点头，没有回答。美里咂了咂舌。"又在闹别扭了。"

He felt heat rising on his face. Frowning, he turned his face in Misato's direction.  
他感到脸上热气上升。皱着眉头，他转向美里的方向。

"I'm trying not to. I'm on my way to see my father, aren't I?"  
"我正努力不这样。我不是正要去见我父亲吗？"

And he wasn't being stubborn out of pride or anything. He meant it. He was becoming more and more afraid that he would regret this, doubt already boiling in his mind.  
而他并非出于骄傲或其他什么而固执。他是认真的。他越来越害怕自己会为此后悔，心中已开始翻腾着怀疑。

Misato turned her head forward and sighed softly. "Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry."  
美里转头向前，轻轻叹了口气。“是啊，你说得对。对不起。”

Just before the air between them became too uncomfortable, the elevator stopped with a cheerful ring.  
就在两人间的空气即将变得过于尴尬之前，电梯发出一声欢快的铃响停了下来。

The door opened to reveal a dim corridor. There were no windows or intersections on either side, just a single, unadorned door standing silently at the end, about twenty meters from the elevator. While Shinji hesitated, Misato started to move, making him hurry after her. Misato slowed down and looked back at Shinji with a grin.  
门打开后，一条昏暗的走廊映入眼帘。两侧没有窗户或岔道，只有一扇朴素的门静静地立在尽头，距离电梯约二十米。尽管真嗣犹豫不决，美里已经开始移动，迫使他匆忙跟上。美里放慢脚步，回头对真嗣咧嘴一笑。

"It's your first time coming up here, right?"  
“你第一次来这里，对吧？”

"Yes." "是的。"

"Remember the way back? To my office, I mean."  
"记得回去的路吗？我是说，回我办公室。"

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"I don't think it'll end up like that, but there's a chance my report could take a long time. So finish your business first, whatever it is, and then go back to my office. Either that or you'll have to stand out here the whole time. This whole floor is the commander's office, and he doesn't have a waiting room or anything. I think it's intentional. Kinda crazy, right?"  
"我觉得不会那样，但我的报告可能要花很长时间。所以你先处理你的事，不管是什么，然后再回我办公室。不然你就得一直站在这儿。这一整层都是指挥官的办公室，他连个等候室都没有。我觉得是故意的。有点疯狂，对吧？"

Shinji smiled awkwardly. "Yeah, I guess."  
真嗣尴尬地笑了笑。 "是啊，我想也是。"

When they arrived at the door, Misato pressed a small button on the wall next to it. There was no sound or anything, so for a moment he wondered if something was wrong or if the total silence was by design. The answer to his question was provided quickly, by a hidden speaker somewhere in the nearby wall. An artificial voice rang through the gloomy corridor.  
当他们到达门口时，美里按下了旁边墙上的一个小按钮。没有任何声音，所以他一时怀疑是不是出了什么问题，或者这种完全的寂静是有意设计的。他的疑问很快得到了解答，附近墙壁里的一个隐藏扬声器传出了一个合成声音，回荡在这阴暗的走廊中。

"The commander is absent at the moment. Please come again."  
“指挥官目前不在。请稍后再来。”

Shinji looked at Misato in confusion. Misato snorted.  
真嗣困惑地看着美里。美里哼了一声。

"Huh, so that asshole thinks he's the only one who's busy, is it? Does he think I keep my appointment because I've got nothing better to do or what?" As she said that, the door burst open, making her freeze on the spot. Shinji's heart sank.  
"哼，那个混蛋以为就他一个人忙吗？他以为我守约是因为我闲得没事干还是怎么的？" 她正说着，门突然被撞开，让她当场愣住。真嗣的心沉了下去。

"Oh, Captain Katsuragi. Asama Research Center, right?"  
"哦，葛城司令。这里是浅间研究中心，对吧？"

The voice was soft and kind. Not Father's. Shinji felt somewhat relieved. It seemed almost incongruent with the tall, imposing figure from which it came, a figure that almost filled the doorway.  
那声音柔和而亲切。不是父亲的。真嗣感到些许宽慰。这声音与门口那高大威严的身影似乎有些不协调，那身影几乎占据了整个门框。

Misato raised her hand in a stiff salute. "Good morning, Vice Commander."  
美里僵硬地举手敬礼。“早上好，副司令。”

Vice Commander Kozo Fuyutsuki casually waved away Misato's salute, and turned to Shinji instead. The light from the inside of the office cast a deep shadow on his face, but still, Shinji could see the kind expression in the wrinkles around the old man's eyes and mouth. "What brought our young man here, I wonder?"  
副司令富士津树随意地挥手示意美里放下敬礼，转而面向真嗣。办公室内的灯光在他脸上投下深深的阴影，但即便如此，真嗣仍能从老人眼角和嘴边的皱纹中看出那份和蔼的表情。“我们的小伙子来这里，是有什么事吗？”

Shinji swallowed. Now that he thought about it, he never had a direct conversation with the Vice Commander before, even though he'd seen the man's face quite a few times by this point. "Oh, hello, sir. I, I'm here to, to see, I mean, to talk, with Fa - Commander Ikari."  
真嗣咽了咽口水。仔细一想，尽管他已经多次见过副司令的面孔，却从未直接与他交谈过。“哦，您好，长官。我，我是来，来见，我的意思是，来和，和碇司令谈话的。”

The Vice Commander nodded slowly, turning to Misato. "Seems the city council business is delaying him. But it's about time he's back. I don't think we'll have to wait more than a few minutes." Then he turned back to Shinji. "You will have to stand a little longer. Can you do that? You've barely gotten out of the hospital, if I recall correctly. You can go in and sit in Ikari's chair, if it's too hard for you. It's the only chair on this floor, ridiculous as it is."  
副司令缓缓点头，转向美里。“看来市议会的公务耽搁了他。不过他应该快回来了。我想我们不用等多久。”随后他又转向真嗣。“你还得再站一会儿。能做到吗？我记得你刚出院不久。如果太辛苦，你可以进去坐在碇的椅子上。这层楼只有那一把椅子，虽然听起来很荒唐。”

_Hell no._ "It's all right. I'll stand here."  
当然不。“没关系。我站这儿就好。”

The moment the Vice Commander turned to Misato and tried to say something, Shinji heard a clanking sound from behind. It was the sound of the elevator door opening. The sound of footsteps echoed in the corridor.  
副司令刚转身想对美里说些什么，真嗣就听到身后传来一阵叮当作响的声音。那是电梯门打开的声音。走廊里回荡着脚步声。

As the Vice Commander nodded a greeting, Misato turned on her heel and saluted. "Good morning, Commander."  
副司令点头致意，美里转身敬礼。“早上好，司令。”

Father stopped a few steps away from Shinji, saying nothing for a moment. Shinji shivered unconsciously as his blank and emotionless eyes, blurred behind his dark glasses, turned toward him.  
父亲在离真嗣几步远的地方停下，沉默片刻。真嗣无意识地颤抖着，他那空洞无情的眼睛，在深色眼镜后模糊地转向他。

"Why are you here?" “你为什么在这里？”

At that single question, Shinji lost all heart, cursing his foolish self for deciding to come here. He also cursed the Class Rep for helping him rationalize the decision in the first place. When he opened his mouth slightly his teeth chattered. Shinji averted his gaze, shut his mouth, swallowed, and raised his head again to look up at Father towering over him.  
听到那一个问题，真嗣顿时心如死灰，暗骂自己愚蠢，竟决定来这里。他也咒骂班长，当初就是她帮他合理化了这个决定。当他微微张开嘴时，牙齿不由自主地打颤。真嗣移开视线，闭上嘴，咽了口唾沫，然后再次抬起头，仰望着站在他面前的父亲。

"I, no, they, I mean the school, they have, career counseling and, and they said I, I have to… inform… parents…"  
“我，不，是他们，我是说学校，他们有，职业辅导和，他们说我，我必须……通知……家长……”

Father turned to Misato without a reply, and for Shinji, it was the most painful response out of all the ones his father could have ever given him.  
父亲转向美里，没有回答，对真嗣来说，这是他父亲可能给出的所有回应中最令他痛苦的一种。

"Have I not delegated such matters to you, Captain?"  
"我不是已经将这些事务委托给你了吗，舰长？"

"I'm sorry, sir. It won't happen again." A professionally dispassionate voice answered the equally emotionless question. Shinji's throat started to swell, and his stomach was boiling. When Father's gaze moved to him again, he felt his whole body shrink.  
"对不起，先生。不会再有下次了。" 一个职业而冷漠的声音回答了同样毫无感情的问题。真嗣的喉咙开始肿胀，胃里翻江倒海。当父亲的目光再次转向他时，他感觉自己的整个身体都在收缩。

"Is that all?" "就这样吗？"

_Won't you ask about my body, if I recovered from my injuries?_ Shinji couldn't ask. A drop of sweat from his forehead rolled down to sting his eyes, making him tear up. Shinji fought the lump in his throat.  
你难道不问问我身体如何，伤势是否痊愈了吗？真嗣问不出口。一滴汗从他的额头滑落，刺痛了他的眼睛，让他泪眼朦胧。真嗣强忍着喉咙里的哽咽。

"I, I've been, suspended from school. I mean, you probably knew that already. I'm, I'm sorry, Father. I won't let you down again."  
“我，我被，被学校停学了。我是说，你可能已经知道了。我，我很抱歉，父亲。我不会再让你失望了。”

Without any particular urgency, Gendo Ikari strode lazily past his son. He didn't even look at him. Shinji lowered his head, a black flame raging in his chest. His hands trembled, and his eyes were burning. The whole world was red.  
没有丝毫紧迫感，碇源堂懒洋洋地从儿子身边走过。他甚至没有看他一眼。真嗣低下头，胸中燃起一股黑色的火焰。他的双手颤抖，眼中燃烧着怒火。整个世界都变成了红色。

The other two people were giving him the look that his father denied him. But Shinji couldn't bear to look up into Vice Commander's and Misato's eyes. For he did not know what he would do if he saw pity there.  
另外两人正用他父亲从未给予他的眼神看着他。但真嗣无法抬头直视副司令和美里小姐的眼睛。因为他不知道，如果从中看到了怜悯，自己会做出什么。

---

The bell finally announced lunch break. With it the last morning class, the longest one she ever had, ended too. Asuka snorted softly, putting her textbook under the desk and glancing around herself. She'd been doing this ever since she arrived at school today, but she couldn't stop herself. And as if to fuel her paranoia, a boy in the corner of the classroom hurriedly dropped his gaze as her eyes settled on him. Something twisted in her stomach.  
终于，铃声宣告了午休的开始。随之结束的还有她经历过的最漫长的上午最后一节课。明日香轻哼一声，将课本塞到桌下，环顾四周。自从今天到校以来，她一直这样，却无法自控。仿佛是为了加剧她的多疑，当她的目光落在教室角落的一个男孩身上时，他急忙垂下了视线。她的胃里一阵翻腾。

_They were always like that,_ Asuka tried to tell herself. Looking at her and practically drooling. That's what they were like ever since she transferred here. It was nothing new or related to…  
他们一直都是那样，明日香试图告诉自己。盯着她，几乎要流口水。自从她转学到这里以来，他们就是这样。这没什么新鲜的，也与……无关。

But then again, those photos must have been circulating from the beginning. It was impossible to guess just how many of those eyes she always felt on her were not heavy with simple thirst, but actually churning with things more insidious and perverted than she thought.  
但话说回来，那些照片想必从一开始就在流传。她无法猜测那些始终感觉在她身上的目光中，有多少不是仅仅带着简单的欲望，而是实际上翻涌着比她所想的更为阴险和变态的东西。

But are those really two fundamentally different things? She shoved her hand in her bag, groping around for her lunchbox. In terms of perviness, there was one certain boy who had tried to kiss her while she was asleep and vulnerable. That was probably worse than whatever things these plebs at school had ever tried on her, but somehow she could not muster any disgust at the thought. However, it almost nauseated her to imagine any other boy in his place, trying to cover her lips with his own.  
但这两者真的有本质上的不同吗？她把手伸进包里，摸索着找她的午餐盒。在变态程度上，有一个特定的男孩曾在她睡着且脆弱时试图亲吻她。这可能比学校里这些庸人曾经对她尝试的任何事情都要糟糕，但不知为何，她对这个想法却无法产生任何厌恶。然而，想象任何其他男孩在他位置上试图用他的嘴唇覆盖她的，几乎让她感到恶心。

_I probably feel that way because I'm an idiot._ Asuka took out her lunch box.  
我大概这么想是因为我是个傻瓜。明日香拿出她的午餐盒。

Asuka squinted at the blue plastic container on her desk. This, too, was the product of her idiotic impulse, something she was starting to regret already. Just like the ultimatum she issued today. What would she do if she didn't get the right answer by the deadline? She felt like she had reduced the scope of her possible actions for no good reason. She wondered if she could take it all back, maybe through a text or something.  
明日香眯起眼睛盯着桌上的蓝色塑料容器。这也是她愚蠢冲动的产物，已经开始后悔了。就像她今天发出的最后通牒一样。如果截止日期前没有得到正确答案，她该怎么办？她觉得自己毫无理由地缩小了可能行动的范围。她想知道是否能收回这一切，也许通过一条短信什么的。

She didn't have much time to think much more about it, because Hikari, with a bright smile and her own lunch box, joined Asuka at her desk. Judging from the atmosphere, it was clear that she would continue to pretend she didn't know anything about a certain unpleasant incident, like she'd done all morning. Yeah, that would be convenient for everyone involved.  
她没有太多时间再深入思考，因为光子带着灿烂的笑容和自己的午餐盒加入了明日香的桌子。从气氛来看，很明显她会继续假装不知道某件不愉快的事情，就像她整个早上所做的那样。是的，这对所有相关人员都很方便。

"Hey, Asuka, did you cook this?"  
“嘿，明日香，这是你做的吗？”

Asuka snorted. Hikari, who clearly didn't expect any other response, grabbed a nearby chair and sat. They opened their lunchboxes. Or rather, Hikari opened hers and Asuka's got stuck. The lid of her lunchbox didn't want to come off.  
明日香哼了一声。光显然没料到其他反应，抓起旁边的一把椅子坐下。她们打开了便当盒。或者更确切地说，光打开了她的，而明日香的却卡住了。她的便当盒盖子就是不肯打开。

"Oh, for Christ's sake." She clenched her teeth, jamming a fingernail in the gap between the lid and the box, but it didn't budge.  
“哦，真是够了。”她咬紧牙关，用指甲抠进盖子和盒子之间的缝隙，但就是纹丝不动。

Hikari's eyebrows went up. "What's wrong?"  
光的眉毛一挑。“怎么了？”

Heat rose in Asuka's face. Not like she was expecting the most pleasant lunch ever. She was expecting the food to be worse than Shinji's (and that was the reason she chose chahan from the book Hikari gave her, because Shinji never made it for her before and that meant she wouldn't have to compare it directly to his cooking) but the lid not cooperating was something she totally did not expect. This never happened when Shinji prepared the box.  
热气在明日香的脸上升腾。她并没有期待这会是一顿多么愉快的午餐。她预料到食物会比真嗣做的还要糟糕（这也是她从光给她的书里选了炒饭的原因，因为真嗣从未为她做过这个，这意味着她不必直接与他的厨艺比较），但饭盒盖子不配合却是她完全没有预料到的。这种情况在真嗣准备饭盒时从未发生过。

Hikari tilted her head. "You didn't close it while the food was hot, did you?"  
光歪了歪头。“你没在食物还热的时候关上它，对吧？”

Asuka's mouth opened slightly without her realizing it. "What? Is that a thing?"  
明日香的嘴微微张开，自己都没意识到。“什么？还有这种讲究？”

Hikari just smiled. Asuka was so irritated by the whole situation that she yanked the lid almost violently with her fingers, only to stop in a hurry when she heard an ominous squeak from one of her nails. It was a good thing that she kept her nails relatively short because of the plugsuit; otherwise, she might have broken a nail or two just then. She still felt some pain, so she left the unruly bento alone for a moment and checked her right index finger. The tip of her nail was chipped quite noticeably.  
光只是微微一笑。明日香对整个情况感到如此恼火，以至于她用手指猛地扯开盖子，几乎带着暴力，却在听到指甲发出不祥的吱吱声时急忙停下。幸好她因为驾驶服而保持了相对较短的指甲，否则她当时可能会断掉一两根指甲。她仍然感到一些疼痛，于是暂时放下了那个不听话的便当，检查了她的右食指。指甲尖明显碎裂了。

Hikari leaned over, but Asuka didn't even look at her. Instead, she stared at her hand with a strangely calming heart. Slowly, she brushed the chipped nail with her middle finger, feeling the rough surface. After she dealt with the lid, she should take some time to file that. She, like every other self-respecting girl, kept a nail file in her bag.  
光凑近了些，但明日香甚至没有看她一眼。相反，她凝视着自己的手，心中却奇怪地平静下来。她慢慢地用中指轻拂碎裂的指甲，感受着粗糙的表面。处理完盖子后，她应该花点时间打磨一下。像其他所有自重的女孩一样，她在包里放了一个指甲锉。

_Or not._ Asuka narrowed her eyes. Maybe he would notice it the next time they held hands, if she just left it like this. She wondered if it would make him worry, like the way he made a fuss about the knife in the morning.  
或者不。明日香眯起眼睛。也许下次他们牵手时，他会注意到这个，如果她就这样放着不管。她想知道这是否会让他担心，就像他早上对那把刀小题大做的样子。

And that thought should have disgusted her in so many different ways. To be so bothered by the thoughts of such a… lowly brat. To actually plan to hold hands _again_ with such a person. But the strangest and most disturbing fact was that she did not actually feel disgusted by the thought. It was the same with his attempted kiss. It was objectively disgusting, and if she imagined any other face in Shinji's place she did feel thoroughly disgusted, but…she couldn't bring out the same reaction from her heart when it was Shinji doing those things to her.  
这个念头本应在许多方面令她感到厌恶。对这样一个……卑微的小子产生如此多的困扰。甚至计划再次与他牵手。但最奇怪和最令人不安的事实是，她并没有真正感到厌恶。就像他试图的吻一样。从客观上讲是令人作呕的，如果她想象任何其他人在真嗣的位置上，她确实会感到彻底的厌恶，但是……当真嗣对她做这些事时，她无法从内心产生同样的反应。

Asuka had a vague idea as to the reason she felt the way she did. It was unthinkable, however, to actually name that uppity idea and by doing so acknowledge it. Its presence was nonetheless clearly felt. She was not an idiot like a certain somebody, after all. Faced with that rogue emotion, she vacillated between helpless capitulation and the violent urge to squash it and rid herself of it for good. What she did in the morning might have been the work of the latter, not the former, now that she thought about it. The part of her that wanted a clear justification to hate and push him away.  
明日香对为什么会有这种感觉有一个模糊的想法。然而，要真正说出那个自命不凡的想法并承认它，是不可想象的。尽管如此，它的存在却清晰地被感受到。她毕竟不是像某人那样的傻瓜。面对那种不受控制的情绪，她在无助的屈服和强烈的想要压制并彻底摆脱它的冲动之间摇摆不定。现在回想起来，她早上所做的可能是后者，而不是前者。她内心那部分想要一个明确的理由去恨他并推开他。

_Yeah, come midnight, this frustrating situation will be over for good, for better or worse. We'll get a reason to hate him.  
是啊，到了午夜，这个令人烦躁的局面将彻底结束，无论结果好坏。我们会有理由去恨他。_

But what if things didn't go the way she wanted? What if her expectations were defied entirely?  
但如果事情没有按照她的意愿发展呢？如果她的期望完全被颠覆了呢？

Asuka realized that she was afraid of that possibility, and it made her angry again. _Fear. Why am I, the great Asuka Langley Soryu, feeling afraid of that boy?_  
明日香意识到她害怕这种可能性，这让她再次感到愤怒。恐惧。为什么我，伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷，会害怕那个男孩？

"What, Suzuhara?" Hikari's voice caught Asuka's attention. She blinked and looked up. The monkey she first met on the _Over The Rainbow_ stood across from her, hesitation written all over his body language. He was wearing his usual tracksuit. The stink of sweat that always seemed to follow him, even on the days they didn't have PE class, made her wrinkle her nose. Did he have business with Hikari? She hoped he would leave soon.  
"什么事，铃原？" 美里的声音吸引了明日香的注意。她眨了眨眼，抬头望去。站在她对面的是她第一次在彩虹之上遇到的猴子，他全身都流露出犹豫不决的姿态。他穿着他那套平常的运动服。那股似乎总是伴随着他的汗臭味，即使在他们没有体育课的日子里，也让她皱起了鼻子。他找美里有什么事吗？她希望他能快点离开。

Hikari must have felt similar to Asuka. "Lost your handout again? Which subject? Math class, right? Ah, no, not now, come back later."  
美里对铃原的感觉可能和明日香相似。"你又把手册弄丢了吗？哪一科的？数学课，对吧？啊，不，现在不行，晚点再来吧。"

"No, it's not that." Suzuhara scratched his head, averting his gaze. "I've got something to say to Soryu, actually."  
"不，不是那个。" 铃原挠了挠头，避开了目光。"其实，我有话要对惣流说。"

"Huh?" Asuka belatedly realized how stupid she sounded. She cleared her throat, raised her chin, and mustered up a tone of venomous contempt. "What is it? Hurry up, I have to eat." She still hadn't figured out a way to open the damn box, but whatever.  
"啊？" 明日香后知后觉地意识到自己听起来有多蠢。她清了清嗓子，抬起下巴，竭力装出一副刻薄轻蔑的语气。"什么事？快点说，我还要吃饭呢。" 她还是没弄明白怎么打开那个该死的盒子，但管它呢。

"Well, I, uh…" Suzuhara blushed, making Asuka doubt her eyesight. Then he looked from side to side, and turned to push away the empty desk behind him, seemingly to make some space around where he stood.  
"呃，我，嗯……" 铃原脸红了，这让明日香怀疑自己的眼睛。随后他左右张望，转身推开身后的空桌子，似乎是为了在他站立的地方腾出一些空间。

Asuka came to her senses at the noise. She opened her mouth to ask the obvious. "What are you doing?"  
明日香被这声音惊醒。她张嘴准备问个显而易见的问题。"你在干什么？"

Then she became speechless again as Toji Suzuhara prostrated himself before her, putting his forehead on the floor. He filled the void created by the shock his sudden action caused with a shout. "I have committed a grave sin against you, Soryu! I did it because I'm stupid and didn't know better! It wasn't anything serious, though! I was just a clerk, taking money and giving back the change! I wasn't interested in your panties or anything!" Then he looked up and flushed, realizing his mistake. After a long pause, he spoke again. "I…I'm not saying I find you ugly or anything! I just, I mean, I have a type and you're just, eh…"  
随后她再次哑口无言，因为铃原东治在她面前俯首贴地，额头紧贴着地板。他大声喊叫，填补了因他突如其来的举动所造成的震惊空白。“我对你犯下了严重的罪行，惣流！我这么做是因为我愚蠢，不知好歹！虽然那不是什么大事！我只是个店员，收钱找零！我对你的内裤什么的根本不感兴趣！”然后他抬起头，脸红了起来，意识到自己的错误。经过长时间的停顿，他又开口了。“我……我不是说你丑或者什么！我只是，我的意思是，我有自己的喜好，而你只是，呃……”

Some of the boys skipped meals in favor of running around on the playground, and not all of the girls ate in the classroom, so the room was half-filled at best. And even that was too large an audience for Asuka. She heard gasps, excited whispers, and murmuring from all directions. Asuka sat frozen at her seat, overwhelmed by all the sudden and unwelcome attention, face flushed. Hikari, on the other hand, bolted up, her chair skidding away. She bent over and grabbed Suzuhara by the back of his collar, and, to Asuka's utter surprise, lifted the boy up.  
有些男孩为了在操场上奔跑而放弃了用餐，并非所有女孩都在教室里吃饭，所以教室最多也就半满。即便如此，对明日香来说，观众还是太多了。她听到四面八方的惊呼、兴奋的低语和窃窃私语。明日香僵坐在座位上，被这突如其来且不受欢迎的关注压得喘不过气来，脸颊通红。另一方面，光子则猛地站起身，椅子滑开。她弯下腰，抓住铃原的衣领，令明日香大为惊讶的是，竟然把男孩提了起来。

"Su. Zu. Ha. Ra. What. The. _Hell._ Are. You. Doing!?"  
"苏. 祖. 哈. 拉. 你. 到. 底. 在. 干. 什. 么！？"

He looked at Hikari like a cat that was caught drinking toilet water. "What do you think?! Apologizing to Soryu! Let me go!"  
他看着光就像一只被抓到喝马桶水的猫。“你觉得呢？！在向索留道歉！放开我！”

"Oh, you little…" Hikari released her grip on his collar in favor of grabbing his ear, and then started dragging him toward the back door. Suzuhara screamed and protested, but Hikari did not even pretend to hear him. "Asuka! Come!"  
“哦，你这个小……”光松开他的衣领，改为抓住他的耳朵，然后开始把他拖向后门。铃原尖叫抗议，但光连假装听都不听。“明日香！过来！”

Only vaguely realizing that Hikari had actually given her an order, Asuka hurriedly stood up and followed her. She sent a single searing look back at the onlookers before she stepped out of the classroom, the intensity of it causing their heads to abruptly turn back to their lunches.  
只是隐约意识到光子实际上给了她一个命令，明日香急忙站起来跟了上去。她回头向旁观者投去一个灼热的目光，然后走出教室，那目光的强烈程度让他们的头猛地转回自己的午餐上。

Suzuhara gibbered and cursed helplessly as the three of them marched down the halls, his voice ringing in their wake. Hikari didn't stop until they reached a quiet corner in one of the halls. It was quiet save for the faint sounds of the boys' soccer match on the distant playground.  
铃原一边走一边无助地喃喃自语和咒骂，他的声音在他们身后回荡。光子直到他们到达走廊的一个安静角落才停下来。除了远处操场上男生足球赛的微弱声响外，这里一片寂静。

"Stop making a scene in front of everyone! Speak properly here!" Hikari squeezed Suzuhara's ear one last time before letting him go. In spite of everything, Asuka was rather impressed and wondered if she could learn the technique so she could try it on the Idiot one day. Suzuhara rubbed his ear, glaring at Hikari. Then he turned to Asuka with a sulky look.  
“别在大家面前闹笑话！在这里好好说话！”光子最后又捏了一下铃原的耳朵才放开他。尽管如此，明日香还是相当佩服，并想知道她是否能学会这一招，以便有一天能用在那个白痴身上。铃原揉着耳朵，瞪着光子。然后他转向明日香，带着一副闷闷不乐的表情。

"I told you everything already. I worked as a clerk of sorts while Kensuke sold his stuff. Took the money, gave back the change, just that. But I swear, I've never filmed anything myself. Think about it, would you want to give your expensive camera to a guy like me? Or want me in charge of fiddling around with a hidden camera? No way. Oh, yeah, that reminded me. I didn't even know about the Okinawa stuff. I'm serious."  
"我已经把一切都告诉你了。我在那里当个类似店员的角色，帮健介卖东西。收钱，找零，就这些。但我发誓，我自己从没拍过任何东西。你想想，你会把昂贵的相机交给像我这样的人吗？或者让我负责摆弄隐藏摄像头？绝不可能。哦，对了，这让我想起来了。我甚至不知道冲绳的事。我是认真的。"

Hikari folded her arms. "First Aida, and now you? I'm really disappointed, Suzuhara. And here I thought -"  
光子交叉双臂。“先是相田，现在又是你？我真的对铃原很失望。我本以为——”

Asuka cleared her throat, stopping Hikari. This was already a stressful day without this monkey flinging more shit on the pile. She didn't want Hikari to make this a bigger deal than it already was, either. While Hikari closed her mouth and Suzuhara looked back and forth between the two girls, Asuka pondered for a moment.  
明日香清了清嗓子，打断了光子。今天已经够烦了，她不想让这只猴子再往这堆麻烦上添乱。她也不希望光子把这件事搞得比现在更严重。光子闭上了嘴，铃原在两个女孩之间来回看着，明日香沉思了一会儿。

Well, it didn't take too long for her to see through his motives. It wasn't that he suddenly grew a conscience or felt sorry for her. He was just doing this because he was afraid to lose Shinji. He was afraid that his relationship with Shinji would be ruined completely. Because he was surprised by what happened to that perv with a camera. Maybe even a little scared. She looked at him contemptuously. She considered telling him exactly what she thought about his apology, but decided to hold back. Not because she was feeling particularly benevolent or anything. At this point, she was just too tired and didn't want to care about the whole stupid situation anymore.  
好吧，她没花太久就看穿了他的动机。并非他突然良心发现或对她感到抱歉。他这么做只是因为害怕失去真嗣。他担心与真嗣的关系会彻底破裂。因为他对那个变态摄影师的遭遇感到震惊，甚至有点害怕。她轻蔑地看着他。她本想告诉他自己的真实想法，但决定忍住。并非她此刻特别仁慈，只是她太累了，不想再理会这整个愚蠢的局面。

Would she regret it later, changing her mind? Possibly. But now, merely looking at him made her exhausted. So Asuka sighed, and waved her hand as if she was shooing a mosquito. "Whatever. I get it. Go away now."  
事后她会后悔改变主意吗？或许会。但现在，光是看着他就让她感到疲惫。于是明日香叹了口气，挥了挥手，仿佛在赶走一只蚊子。"随便你。我明白了。现在走开吧。"

Suzuhara blinked. But it was Hikari who spoke up first. "Asuka, really?"  
铃原眨了眨眼。但首先开口的是光。"明日香，真的吗？"

Before Asuka could say anything, Suzuhara took a step forward, stretched out his shoulders and tapped his chest with a fist. The sight reminded Asuka of an ape.  
在明日香能说出任何话之前，铃原向前迈了一步，伸展了一下肩膀，用拳头敲了敲自己的胸膛。这一幕让明日香想起了猿猴。

"I can't tolerate that! I'd say at least slap me like you did that time I saw your panties! Two times even! If one's not enough!"  
“我可受不了这个！我宁愿你像那次看到你内裤时那样扇我一巴掌！两次！如果一次不够的话！”

Hikari gasped, turning to Suzuhara with her mouth wide open, a blush on her freckled cheeks. Asuka wanted to tear her hair out, head throbbing with a fresh headache. It was the best decision on Hikari's part to drag this boy out of the classroom, she thought.  
光希倒吸一口气，转向铃原，嘴巴张得大大的，雀斑脸上泛起红晕。明日香真想扯自己的头发，头痛欲裂。她觉得光希最好的决定就是把这男孩拖出教室。

Suzuhara must have interpreted Asuka's silence in the wrong way, because he closed his eyes, and grabbed the hem of his pants with both hands. "Yeah! You're right! It's wrong of me to get away with this with only a slap on the face! I admit it! An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, then panties for -"  
铃原一定是误解了明日香沉默的含义，因为他闭上了眼睛，双手紧紧抓住裤脚。“是啊！你说得对！我只挨一巴掌就逃脱是不对的！我承认！以眼还眼，以牙还牙，那内裤就——”

Asuka hissed through her clenched teeth. That must have sounded threatening enough, because Suzuhara froze, eyes wide open. Ignoring Hikari's shaky gaze for the time being, Asuka raised a finger to the boy. "Do it, and you'll wish I only slapped you. Trust me. Don't try my patience anymore. Just get lost."  
明日香咬紧牙关发出嘶嘶声。这听起来一定足够威胁，因为铃原僵住了，眼睛瞪得大大的。暂时无视光子颤抖的目光，明日香向男孩竖起一根手指。“敢做，你会希望我只扇了你一巴掌。相信我。别再试探我的耐心了。滚开。”

He blinked a few times, mouth opening and closing repeatedly. Then Suzuhara made his first right decision of the day: turning around and running away. Only after turning the corner once and disappearing from the girls' view did he shout "Sorry!" again.  
他眨了几下眼，嘴巴张开又闭上。然后铃原做出了他今天第一个正确的决定：转身逃跑。直到转过拐角，从女孩们的视线中消失后，他才再次大喊“对不起！”

Asuka sighed. She started to consider leaving early, citing a regular synchronization test in the Geofront, scheduled for this afternoon. Those tests were scheduled so as to not hinder school classes, but no one would dare verify it if she simply lied, she figured.  
明日香叹了口气。她开始考虑提前离开，借口是下午在 Geofront 安排的常规同步测试。这些测试安排在不干扰学校课程的时间，但她认为，如果她撒个谎，也没人敢去核实。

"Hikari, let's go. I'm hungry."  
“光，我们走吧。我饿了。”

Asuka took a step toward the classroom, then stopped and looked back. Hikari hadn't moved, head lowered, biting her own lips.  
明日香朝教室迈了一步，随即停下回头看去。光没有动，头低垂着，咬着自己的嘴唇。

"What's wrong?" "怎么了？"

Hikari looked up, a strange expression on her face. She gazed at Asuka. "Asuka, you don't seem to be angry. I expected much worse, honestly."  
光抬起头，脸上带着一种奇怪的表情。她凝视着明日香。“明日香，你看起来并不生气。老实说，我本以为会更糟糕。”

Asuka snorted. 明日香哼了一声。

"Of course I'm angry. Why wouldn't I be? I mean, not to the degree I'm angry with that glasses perv, sure." Hikari opened her mouth, and closed it again, seeing Asuka continue. "I don't expect boys to be decent and smart, that's why I'm not too angry with them. I mean, I get mad at them, but I'll stress myself to death if I beat them one by one every time they do something stupid."  
“我当然生气。为什么不呢？我是说，当然没有对那个戴眼镜的变态那么生气，肯定的。”光张开嘴，又闭上了，看到明日香继续说道。“我不指望男生们能体面又聪明，这就是为什么我对他们不太生气的原因。我是说，我会对他们发火，但如果每次他们做蠢事我都一个个去揍他们，我会把自己累死的。”

Hikari smiled bitterly. "You're very mature, aren't you? I don't think I could stand it if I were you."  
光苦笑着说：“你真的很成熟，不是吗？如果我是你，我想我承受不了。”

_It's nothing like that,_ Asuka couldn't say. She couldn't say that there were too many things in this world she hated, to the point she couldn't possibly stay mad at any one thing for too long. She couldn't say that out of all those things, what she hated the most was…  
阿斯卡无法说出那不是那样的。她无法说出这个世界上有太多她讨厌的事情，以至于她不可能对任何一件事长时间生气。她无法说出在所有这些事情中，她最讨厌的是……

Asuka bit her lips and stopped the train of thought. No, Asuka Langley Soryu was the best. The most elite. The one to be looked up to, desired, and envied. Not hated. It was such a firm fact that no one should deny it. No one at all.  
阿斯卡咬了咬嘴唇，停止了思绪。不，明日香·兰格雷是最优秀的。最精英的。是值得仰望、渴望和嫉妒的人。不是被讨厌的。这是一个如此坚定的事实，没有人应该否认它。绝对没有。

Not even herself. 甚至不是她自己。

"Uhm, Asuka…" “呃，明日香……”

Asuka cleared her throat. "What?"  
明日香清了清喉咙。“什么？”

"Is it true?" Hikari looked almost depressed, avoiding eye contact with Asuka. Asuka frowned.  
"真的吗？" 光看起来几乎有些沮丧，避开了与明日香的目光接触。明日香皱起了眉头。

"What?" "什么？"

"Well," Hikari lowered her head, clasped her hands together, and began wriggling her fingers. Asuka became annoyed, now wanting nothing other than to go back to the classroom and finally eat her lunch, before Hikari spoke again. "I mean, did Suzuhara.. see…"  
"嗯，" 光低下了头，双手紧握，开始扭动手指。明日香变得烦躁，现在只想回到教室，终于吃她的午餐，但光又开口了。"我是说，铃原他...看到了…"

A snort, to Asuka, was something she consciously and tactically applied to show her contempt for a person or topic, but this time it was more of a reflex. She shook her head to reinforce the point. "It's not important. Let's hurry up and eat. I'm hungry."  
对明日香来说，嗤之以鼻是她有意识且策略性地用来表达对某人或某事的不屑，但这次更多的是一种本能反应。她摇了摇头以加强这一点。"这不重要。我们快点吃吧。我饿了。"

"Oh. Okay." "哦，好吧。"

Asuka wondered why Hikari was so gloomy all of a sudden, but decided not to ask. By the time they returned to the classroom, the other girl was back to her usual cheery mood.  
明日香不明白为什么光突然变得这么忧郁，但她决定不问。当她们回到教室时，光已经恢复了往常的愉快心情。

---

Only after going all the way down to the cafeteria and finding hot water was Asuka able to pry the pesky lid off the lunch box and eat. The taste was passable, but she concluded that should never use sweetcorn again if she were to use the same recipe. Corn in fried rice was suspicious enough on paper, and in this case there was no such thing as a pleasant surprise.  
直到一路下到食堂找到热水，明日香才终于打开了那个烦人的饭盒盖子开始吃饭。味道还算过得去，但她得出结论，如果再用同样的食谱，绝对不能再放甜玉米了。炒饭里放玉米在纸上看起来就够可疑的了，而这次也确实没有什么惊喜可言。

All the while she felt eyes following her everywhere she went, and every time she had to calm herself down, muttering to herself that nothing had actually changed since the moment she transferred here, that it was always like that. She just didn't know about it before.  
她始终感觉有目光如影随形，无论走到哪里都紧随其后。每次她都得安抚自己，喃喃自语说自从转学到这里，一切其实并未改变，一直都是这样。只是她之前未曾察觉罢了。

Soon class resumed, boring as always. Then the break time came, and Hikari and a few other girls would come and chit-chat about this and that before going back to their seats. After two such cycles repeated themselves, school finally ended. Only after the bell rang and she slowly started packing her school bag did Asuka realize how much pressure she felt the whole time. How relieved she was now.  
不久，课程一如既往地乏味重启。接着是课间休息，光和几个女生会过来闲聊几句，然后各自回到座位。如此循环两次后，学校终于放学了。直到铃声响起，她才开始慢慢收拾书包，这时明日香才意识到自己一整天承受了多大的压力。此刻的她，感到多么的释然。

Asuka pulled her bag off the hook and slung it over her shoulder, frowning. Throughout the whole day not a single person, including the teachers, mentioned the recent incident, not even in passing. The only exception was Suzuhara's stupid stunt. The suspension of Shinji and the disappearance of that glasses perv (Asuka guessed that he was in a hospital somewhere), were being treated as if they never happened. Back then, Hikari had told Asuka that she wasn't the only victim. Today, everyone, including Hikari, insisted on avoiding the topic altogether.  
明日香从挂钩上取下书包，甩到肩上，皱起了眉头。一整天下来，没有一个人，包括老师们，提及最近的事件，甚至不经意间也没有。唯一的例外是铃原的愚蠢行为。真嗣的停学和那个戴眼镜的变态的消失（明日香猜测他可能在某个医院里），都被当作从未发生过。那时，光曾告诉明日香她不是唯一的受害者。今天，包括光在内的所有人，都坚持完全避开这个话题。

If not for Suzuhara, Asuka would've started to question if she was delusional and had dreamt the whole thing.  
如果不是铃原，明日香可能会开始怀疑自己是不是产生了幻觉，梦见了整件事。

Asuka smiled and waved to the approaching Hikari, telling her "NERV test. Bye.", and turned her eyes to Shinji's empty seat.  
明日香微笑着向走近的光挥手，告诉她“NERV 测试。再见。”，然后将目光转向真嗣空荡荡的座位。

It wasn't just school, she realized suddenly. The whole city ran on the same rule, and this recent incident was just one trivial example out of many.  
她突然意识到，不仅仅是学校，整个城市都遵循着同样的规则，而最近的事件不过是众多微不足道例子中的一个。

What about the war against Angels, for example? This city was essentially the front line of the battle against those eldritch horrors, but the place didn't seem too affected by the fact. The normal rhythm of daily life resumed almost as soon as the threat had passed, as if the whole thing was only a nightmare that would vanish under the morning sun. Asuka recalled the day after she and Shinji defeated the 7th Angel right in the core part of the city. Except for a few sections that were under repair, guarded against public eyes by screens, the city was almost jarringly peaceful afterwards. She heard it was the same with all the previous battles Shinji fought before she came.  
比如对抗使徒的战争呢？这座城市本质上是对抗那些恐怖存在的最前线，但这个地方似乎并未因此受到太大影响。日常生活的节奏几乎在威胁过去后立即恢复，仿佛这一切只是一个会在晨光中消散的噩梦。明日香回想起她和真嗣在城市核心区域击败第 7 使徒后的那天。除了几处正在修复、被屏幕遮挡不让公众看到的部分外，城市之后几乎异常平静。她听说在她来之前，真嗣参与的所有战斗后情况都是如此。

_Turning their eyes from the things they didn't want to see. Treating them as if they didn't exist at all. That's what these people do,_ Asuka thought. She knew she wasn't supposed to expect much from plebs, but this particular quality they displayed was contemptible.  
对不想看到的事物视而不见，仿佛它们根本不存在。这就是这些人所做的，明日香想。她知道不该对普通人抱有太多期待，但他们展现出的这种特质实在令人鄙夷。

Something tugged at her mind at the thought, but she ignored it, instead staring at Shinji's empty chair. To some people, ignoring the whole Angel business must not be that hard, she figured.  
这个念头在她心中轻轻牵动，但她置之不理，只是凝视着真嗣空荡荡的椅子。她想，对某些人来说，忽视整个使徒的事务或许并不那么困难。

It was not the case for others, though. Some people's job was to face the thing that the world was trying its best to ignore. Those people belonged to another world. They pretended to blend into the world of reason and peace when they were at school, at subway stations, and at convenience stores, but had to regularly step away from those places to dive into a world of horrors. They were blessed and cursed at the same time.  
然而，对其他人来说并非如此。有些人的职责是面对这个世界竭力忽视的东西。这些人属于另一个世界。他们在学校、地铁站和便利店假装融入理性与和平的世界，却不得不定期离开这些地方，潜入恐怖的深渊。他们同时被祝福与诅咒。

It was a lonely way of being. For a while there, she thought she had gotten used to it, but something recently reminded her of the bitter taste of loneliness. Maybe, with someone who shares her world, she wouldn't…  
这是一种孤独的存在方式。有一段时间，她以为自己已经习惯了，但最近有些事让她再次尝到了孤独的苦涩。或许，如果有个人能与她共享这个世界，她就不会……

Asuka frowned. She turned her eyes away from Shinji's chair. She caught a boy staring blankly at her, absent-mindedly rubbing the blackboard with the eraser even though the board was clean already. She didn't even feel like glaring at him so she just ignored it. She was already angry enough as it was. At herself.  
明日香皱了皱眉。她将目光从真嗣的椅子上移开。她注意到一个男孩正茫然地盯着她，心不在焉地用黑板擦擦拭着已经干净的板面。她连瞪他的心情都没有，只是置之不理。她已经够生气了，对自己。

_He's making me weak._ Asuka gritted her teeth, thinking. _I'm letting him into my world without even realizing it. That idiot._  
他让我变得软弱。明日香咬紧牙关，心想。我不知不觉间让他进入了我的世界。那个白痴。

The next moment, she almost laughed out loud. For there was one more person besides Shinji that Asuka did not want but who was part of her world nonetheless. That person appeared in front of her seemingly out of nowhere. Asuka didn't even hear her footsteps. Very ghost-like, indeed, as always. She even wore her trademark blank face.  
下一刻，她差点笑出声来。因为除了真嗣之外，还有一个人是明日香不希望却无法避免地存在于她的世界中的。那个人仿佛凭空出现在她面前。明日香甚至没听到她的脚步声。确实一如既往地像幽灵一样。她甚至保持着那副标志性的面无表情。

"Second. Regular test. Headquarters."  
"第二。常规测试。总部。"

"Yeah, First. Regular test. Headquarters," Asuka replied in a mimicry of Ayanami's deadpan tone.  
"是啊，第一。常规测试。总部，" 明日香模仿着绫波的平淡语气回答道。

Ayanami stared back at Asuka with silent, emotionless red eyes. Asuka returned her gaze with a smirk. She hoped that it managed to fully convey the contempt she harbored for this 'fellow pilot' and in doing so hurt her.  
绫波用沉默无情的红色眼睛回望着明日香。明日香则带着一丝冷笑回视她。她希望这笑容能充分传达出她对这个'同僚驾驶员'的蔑视，并借此伤害到她。

_What the hell is wrong with you, Asuka?_ a small voice whispered from inside. _What did she even do to you to deserve such treatment?_  
你到底怎么了，明日香？一个微小的声音从内心深处传来。她究竟做了什么，要受到这样的对待？

It almost mellowed her heart for a moment, but then she recalled the humiliation she suffered at the pedestrian overpass. In front of everyone, when she magnanimously reached out first and was then swatted away like an annoying fly for no particular reason.  
那一刻，她的心几乎软化了，但随即她想起了在人行天桥上遭受的羞辱。当她慷慨地首先伸出援手，却无缘无故像只烦人的苍蝇一样被拍开，当着所有人的面。

Ayanami held her gaze for a while, then turned around and headed for the hallway. Asuka glared at her back for a moment and followed her.  
绫波凝视了她一会儿，然后转身走向走廊。明日香瞪着她的背影片刻，随后跟了上去。

---

The two girls left the school gate without a word. Ayanami took the lead, Asuka following about two steps behind her. The sidewalks, once crowded with students leaving school, became noticeably empty and quiet as they walked further and further in the opposite direction to the train station, where most of the students were headed.  
两个女孩一言不发地离开了校门。绫波走在前面，明日香则跟在她身后大约两步之遥。随着她们越走越远，与大多数学生前往的车站方向相反，原本挤满离校学生的街道变得明显空旷而寂静。

Shortly after leaving the gate, Asuka realized she didn't like the fact that Ayanami was ahead of her, but she didn't speed up to catch or pass her. She might have done so in a more normal situation, but today she was already too tired and confused, and on top of that the day was simply too hot.  
离开校门不久，明日香意识到她不喜欢绫波走在她前面，但她并没有加快脚步去追赶或超过她。在更正常的情况下，她可能会这么做，但今天她已经太过疲惫和困惑，再加上天气异常炎热。

There was little to no noise around, and the two didn't talk throughout the whole walk, so only the loud whirring of cicadas filled the silence. Asuka realized this was the first time the two of them spent an extended time alone together. Most of the time Shinji was there with them, stuck in the middle. No. Most of the time Shinji was with Asuka while the First quietly followed.  
周围几乎没有声音，两人一路无言，只有蝉鸣的响亮声响填满了沉默。明日香意识到这是她们俩第一次长时间单独相处。大多数时候，真嗣都在她们中间，夹在两人之间。不，大多数时候真嗣是和明日香在一起，而绫波则静静地跟在后面。

First. Asuka frowned as she chewed on the word, her old repulsion to it bubbling up again. As her eyebrows furrowed, a drop of sweat that was on them rolled down to her eye, stinging it. Asuka wiped it away with her free hand.  
第一。明日香皱着眉咀嚼着这个词，旧时的反感再次涌上心头。随着她的眉头紧锁，一滴汗珠从眉间滚落，刺痛了她的眼睛。明日香用空着的手将其抹去。

The First Child. The first to be chosen, even earlier than Asuka. These days, the latecomer, Shinji, was attracting Asuka's attention, but for the longest time it was the thought of the First that burned in her mind, making her uncomfortable and setting a competitive fire alight inside her. Asuka had long wondered what it was about the First that made her so much better than Asuka, since she was chosen before her. In the following years, thoughts like that had settled down somewhat. She had heard, while eavesdropping on careless NERV Berlin personnel, that her synchro rate was vastly better than the First's in Japan. But the bitter taste itself remained, its presence never far from her mind.  
第一适格者。比明日香更早被选中的第一人。这些日子，后来者真嗣吸引了明日香的注意，但长久以来，她心中燃烧的却是对第一适格者的思绪，这让她感到不安，并在内心点燃了竞争的火焰。明日香一直想知道，究竟是什么让第一适格者比她更优秀，以至于被选在她的前面。随后的几年里，这样的想法有所平息。她曾无意中听到柏林 NERV 的粗心员工提及，她的同步率远超日本的第一适格者。但那份苦涩的滋味依旧挥之不去，始终萦绕在她的心头。

Then, when she finally came to Japan and saw her old rival with her own eyes for the first time, a different kind of disgust started to form in her mind, something Asuka couldn't fully explain to herself.  
然而，当她终于来到日本，第一次亲眼见到昔日的对手时，一种不同以往的厌恶感开始在她的心中滋生，这是明日香无法完全向自己解释的情感。

Maybe that was why Asuka, right now, restarted her offense in an oh-so-innocent voice.  
或许这就是为什么，此刻的明日香会用一种极其无辜的语气重新发起攻势。

"I heard they're done repairing Unit-0. Is that right?"  
“我听说零号机已经修好了，对吧？”

Ayanami replied quietly, without slowing down or looking back. "You are right. Why?"  
绫波平静地回答，没有放慢脚步或回头。“你说得没错。怎么了？”

_Passive aggressive, aren't you?_ Asuka almost smiled at such a timid counteroffensive. It provoked her fighting instinct. Of course, that didn't matter. She would have carried out her prearranged attack regardless.  
被动攻击，是吧？明日香几乎要笑了，这种胆怯的反击激起了她的战斗本能。当然，这并不重要。无论如何，她都会执行预先安排好的攻击。

"I just thought you'd be a little busier from now on."  
“我只是觉得从现在开始你会更忙一些。”

Ayanami didn't answer this time. Asuka waited for a response, then spoke again when none came. "Your record is disappointing, don't you think? You were awful when it was just you and Shinji. With me in the field, you'll have to try much harder. This competition just got real. Honestly, I'd be worried if I were you. But you don't seem very bothered. Overconfident much?"  
绫波这次没有回答。明日香等待着回应，然后在没有得到回应时再次开口。“你的记录令人失望，你不觉得吗？只有你和真嗣的时候，你表现得很糟糕。有我在场上，你得更加努力才行。这场竞争现在变得真实了。老实说，如果我是你，我会很担心。但你似乎并不怎么在意。过于自信了吗？”

Ayanami kept her silence again, walking several steps before stopping at the crosswalk. The red traffic light buzzed and flickered. Ayanami looked sideways at Asuka when she reached her side. "Competition?"  
绫波再次保持沉默，走了几步后在人行横道前停下。红灯嗡嗡作响，闪烁不定。绫波走到她身边时斜眼看了看明日香。"竞争？"

Asuka nodded, smiling ferociously. "Yeah, competition. To see who's the best pilot. To establish a proper hierarchy. That's how the world works, after all. There's always someone who's better than the rest, and someone who's inferior. We need to figure out who belongs where and treat them accordingly."  
明日香点头，露出凶猛的笑容。"没错，竞争。看看谁是最优秀的驾驶员。确立一个正确的等级制度。毕竟，世界就是这样运转的。总有人比其他人更出色，也有人处于劣势。我们需要弄清楚谁该处于什么位置，并相应对待他们。"

Ayanami's eyes narrowed ever so slightly. It was the biggest reaction Asuka had ever drawn from this robot of a girl, and it made her feel so good.  
绫波的眼神微微眯起。这是明日香从这位机器人般的女孩身上引出的最大反应，这让她感觉非常好。

"Is that why you pilot Eva?"  
"这就是你驾驶 EVA 的原因吗？"

"Why else? I do it to prove my abilities and show everyone what a brilliant genius I am. Why would anyone go through all this trouble if not for that? Why do you pilot Eva?"  
"不然呢？我这么做是为了证明我的能力，向所有人展示我是个多么出色的天才。如果不是为了这个，谁会愿意经历这一切麻烦？你又是为什么驾驶 EVA 呢？"

The traffic light went out with a buzzing sound. Asuka turned her eyes to it. The red light was gone, but the green light was off too. Asuka frowned.  
交通灯发出嗡嗡声熄灭了。明日香将目光转向它。红灯已经消失，但绿灯也熄灭了。明日香皱起了眉头。

Ayanami opened her mouth. "I pilot Eva because -"  
绫波打开了她的嘴。“我驾驶 Eva 是因为——”

A loud horn interrupted her. Two black sedans were rushing down the hill behind them. Asuka couldn't see the inside of them through their thick window tints. The cars had NERV's own special plates in place of civilian ones. They were her bodyguards, Asuka realized. Section 2 or something.  
一声响亮的喇叭打断了她。两辆黑色轿车正从他们身后的山坡上疾驰而下。厚重的车窗贴膜让明日香无法透过车窗看到车内的情况。这些车挂着 NERV 专属的特殊车牌，而非民用牌照。明日香意识到，这是她的保镖，第二课之类的。

As she expected, the cars stopped with a screech just in front of Asuka and Ayanami. The back door that was facing the sidewalk opened, and at the same time the driver's side window went down to reveal a man dressed in a black suit and black sunglasses.  
正如她所料，车子伴随着刺耳的刹车声停在了明日香和绫波面前。面对人行道的后车门打开，同时司机侧的车窗降下，露出一个身穿黑色西装、戴着黑色墨镜的男人。

He looked like a perfect stereotype of a government agent. Asuka almost found it hilarious. He nodded to the girls. "Miss Soryu, Miss Ayanami, please, get in."  
他看起来活脱脱就是一个政府特工的典型形象。明日香几乎觉得这很滑稽。他对女孩们点头示意。“碇小姐，绫波小姐，请上车。”

Asuka's eyebrows went up. Maybe it was a good thing. She was sweating pretty badly now. But they'd never been picked up by NERV for a simple synchronization test. She wondered what the reason was behind this unusual offer. "Why?"  
明日香的眉毛挑了起来。或许这是件好事。她现在汗流浃背。但她们从未因为简单的同步测试而被 NERV 接走过。她想知道这个不寻常提议背后的原因。“为什么？”

The driver turned to his partner in the passenger seat. The partner nodded slightly, and from their faces, Asuka read a tension that couldn't be completely covered by sunglasses and training. It made her shudder.  
司机转向副驾驶座的同伴。同伴微微点头，从他们的脸上，明日香读出了墨镜和训练也无法完全掩盖的紧张。这让她不寒而栗。

"We have reasons to believe something unusual is happening at headquarters and by extension, the city. We can't provide more details at the moment. So please, get in."  
"我们有理由相信总部，乃至整个城市，正在发生一些不寻常的事情。目前无法提供更多细节。所以请尽快进来。"

---

"Well, that was anticlimactic, compared to all the noise in the beginning. Right?" Misato muttered, pressing the enter key. One paragraph done, too many more to go.  
"好吧，比起开头那阵喧闹，这真是虎头蛇尾，对吧？" 美里喃喃自语，按下回车键。一段完成，还有太多待写。

Dr. Ritsuko Akagi, sitting across the desk, stopped tapping on her laptop keyboard and fixed her glasses with one hand. The light of the common lounge, significantly dimmer than usual because only one-third of the lights were on, flashed on her lenses.  
坐在桌子对面的赤木律子博士，停下了敲击笔记本键盘的手，用一只手扶了扶眼镜。公共休息室的光线比平时暗了许多，因为只有三分之一的灯亮着，灯光在她镜片上闪烁。

"Are you serious?" Ritsuko asked. "Of the seven battles we've fought so far, the damage the facility attained today is simply unrivaled. Why do you think we're working overtime right now? The entire city, including HQ, was without electricity for six full hours. We have no clue what caused it, or if it's related to the Angel's attack at all. Just thinking about how much the electronic infrastructure has been damaged terrifies me, you know. Even a personal computer isn't supposed to be unplugged suddenly while you're using it. Have you thought about what kind of damage all the delicate machinery took from the voltage drop? It's a good thing we kept the Magi mainframe going till the end, at least."  
"“你是认真的吗？”律子问道，“迄今为止我们经历了七场战斗，今天的设施受损程度简直是前所未有的。你以为我们为什么现在还在加班？整个城市，包括总部，都断电了整整六个小时。我们完全不知道原因，也不知道是否与使徒的攻击有关。一想到电子基础设施遭受了多大的破坏，我就感到害怕，你知道的。即使是个人电脑也不应该在使用时突然断电。你有没有想过电压骤降对所有精密机械造成了什么样的损害？幸好我们一直坚持到最后一刻才关闭 MAGI 主机的运行。”

Misato raised her eyebrows. "You're not supposed to unplug a computer?"  
"美里挑了挑眉，“电脑不能突然断电吗？”

"What?" "什么？"

Misato shrugged. "Well, that's all because of the blackout, and working overtime is the norm after an operation. If you look at things purely from a fighting perspective, it was a very boring engagement."  
"美里耸了耸肩，“嗯，这都是因为停电，而且行动后加班是常态。如果单纯从战斗的角度来看，这是一场非常无聊的交锋。”

Ritsuko sighed, half in exasperation and half in awe at the simplicity of her perspective. Misato picked up a coffee mug from the table and took a sip. The PA crackled to life, calling for someone from the technical department. One person in a group of workers who'd fled to the far corner tables after seeing Misato and Ritsuko entering the place stood up in a hurry and rushed out of the lounge.  
律子叹了口气，一半是无奈，一半是对她这种简单视角的惊叹。美里从桌上拿起一个咖啡杯，抿了一口。PA 系统突然响起，呼叫技术部门的人员。一群工人中，有个人在看到美里和律子进入这个地方后，便躲到了远处的角落桌，此刻他急忙起身，匆匆离开了休息室。

Ritsuko opened her mouth, resting her chin on her hand. "Was it, though? Was the combat really that uneventful?"  
律子张开嘴，手托着下巴。“不过，真的吗？战斗真的那么平淡无奇吗？”

Misato snorted, turning her gaze to the recorder she had thrown down by her laptop. As always, everything the pilots reported during the post-battle debriefing was recorded there and would be heard again and again later tonight as she wrote the preliminary report. Since the videos saved by the internal recorder in the Evangelion units were not accessible, that tape was the only thing she had. For now, at least. Fortunately, she didn't need it to answer Ritsuko's question now.  
美里哼了一声，目光转向她扔在笔记本电脑旁的录音机。一如既往，飞行员们在战后汇报中所说的一切都被记录在那里，今晚她将一遍又一遍地听这些录音，撰写初步报告。由于无法访问 EVA 单位内部记录器保存的视频，那盘磁带是她目前唯一的资料。至少现在是。幸运的是，她现在不需要它来回答律子的问题。

"Shinji was too quick, almost reckless. Things could have gone very wrong, I think. But he had no way to know that Asuka and Rei were a minute away from him by the time he acted. Comms were down throughout the whole operation, after all. I don't think we could blame him."  
"真嗣太快了，几乎有些鲁莽。事情本可能变得非常糟糕，我想。但他无法知道那时绫波和明日香离他只有一分钟的路程。毕竟，整个行动中的通讯都中断了。我觉得我们不能怪他。"

"But it was Unit-02 that got more damaged."  
"但受损更严重的是二号机。"

"Because it was Asuka who approached the Angel and neutralized its AT field. While she took the brunt of Angel's attack, Shinji shot it down."  
"因为正是明日香接近了使徒并中和了它的 AT 力场。在她承受了使徒攻击的同时，真嗣将其击落。"

Ritsuko casually resumed typing. "She's great, I guess. Quite an addition to our arsenal. What did Rei do?"  
律子随意地继续打字。“她很棒，我想。对我们来说是个不错的补充。丽做了什么？”

Misato shrugged. "Rearguard, or whatever Asuka called it. She basically ordered Rei to stay behind, I heard."  
美里耸了耸肩。“后卫，或者说是明日香所谓的。我听说她基本上命令丽留在后面。”

With a loud click, the lounge brightened. Ritsuko looked around, then folded her laptop and got up. "They must have stabilized the power supply. I'm heading back to my lab. Call me if you need anything."  
随着一声响亮的咔嗒声，休息室亮了起来。律子环顾四周，然后合上笔记本电脑站起身来。“他们一定已经稳定了电源供应。我要回实验室了。有事打电话给我。”

Misato lifted the mug in salute. Ritsuko nodded and left, the metallic clacking of her heels on the linoleum fading into the distance  
美里举起杯子致意。律子点头后离开，她的高跟鞋在油毡地板上发出的金属般敲击声逐渐消失在远处。

Misato finished the remaining coffee in a single swig and started to pack her things too. Not only was she uncomfortable in this common space, but there were some things to do that could only be handled on her office desktop. She had no reason to stay here anymore either if the power was back.  
美里一口喝完剩下的咖啡，也开始收拾自己的东西。她不仅在这个公共空间感到不自在，而且有些事情只能在她的办公室电脑上处理。既然电力已经恢复，她也没有理由继续留在这里了。

As she was getting up from the table, she made eye contact with one of the low-level employees who huddled around the corner table munching on late-night snacks. He looked so young in the tan NERV uniform. The kid was probably barely out of college. Misato winked at him. "You can use this table now."  
当她从桌边起身时，她与角落桌旁围坐在一起吃夜宵的一名低级员工对上了视线。他穿着土黄色的 NERV 制服，看起来非常年轻。这孩子可能刚大学毕业不久。美里朝他眨了眨眼。“你现在可以用这张桌子了。”

As the red-faced boy hurriedly stood up and saluted, all eight of the men and women sitting at the same table with him looked Misato's way. "Yes, Ma'am!" they chorused.  
当那个脸红的男孩匆忙站起并敬礼时，与他同桌的八位男女都转向了美里。“是，少校！”他们齐声回答。

It didn't take long to get back to her office. Hot, stuffy air welcomed her the moment she opened the door. She put her laptop bag and beret on her desk first before turning to the light switch. That was the moment she smelled something incredibly suspicious.  
回到她的办公室并不需要很长时间。她一开门，闷热潮湿的空气就迎面扑来。她先把笔记本包和贝雷帽放在桌上，然后转身去开灯。就在这时，她闻到了一股极其可疑的气味。

The scent of cologne mingled with sweat. She was familiar with both the brand choice and that specific body odor. So Misato was not surprised when muscular arms came out of nowhere to hug her from behind.  
古龙水的香味混杂着汗味。她对这品牌的选择和那特有的体味都很熟悉。所以当强壮的手臂不知从哪儿冒出来从背后抱住她时，美里并不感到惊讶。

"Hey, I was afraid you might have had an accident, Katsuragi."  
"嘿，我还担心你是不是出了什么事故呢，克图拉吉。"

Misato sighed, loosened his arms, and stepped away from him. Kaji let her go without much resistance. She folded her arms and turned around to face him. He was never the neat and clean type, but today he almost looked disgusting. But then again, 12 hours had passed since they'd come to work, and roughly half of those were spent in a poorly ventilated underground bunker. It was almost natural to look greasy. In fact, Misato wasn't too sure if she was any better looking than him.  
美里叹了口气，松开他的手臂，向后退了一步。加持没有太多反抗就让她离开了。她交叉双臂，转过身面对着他。他从来就不是那种整洁干净的人，但今天他几乎看起来令人作呕。不过话说回来，自从他们开始工作已经过去了 12 个小时，其中大约一半时间是在通风不良的地下掩体中度过的。看起来油腻腻的几乎是自然而然的事。事实上，美里也不太确定自己看起来是否比他好多少。

"You stink. And you were nowhere to be seen in the command center or the hangar. Where the hell were you?"  
"你臭死了。指挥中心和机库也找不到你的人影。你到底跑哪儿去了？"

Kaji sniffed his armpit. "I was stuck in the elevator. It got a little hot in there after a few hours, you know."  
加治嗅了嗅自己的腋下。“我被困在电梯里了。在里面待了几个小时后，有点热起来了，你知道的。”

"Then maybe you should go home, wash up and sleep instead of crawling around in here."  
“那也许你应该回家，洗个澡，然后睡觉，而不是在这里爬来爬去。”

"Well, I wanted to see if you were all right."  
“嗯，我想看看你是不是还好。”

Misato snorted and flipped the switch. In a flash, the office brightened up. Kaji closed his eyes and opened them again theatrically. While he was doing that, Misato went to her desk and fell into her chair. Her hair indeed felt a little greasy when she ran her fingers through it. She was starting to feel tired already.  
美里哼了一声，扳动开关。一瞬间，办公室亮堂起来。加持闭上眼睛，又戏剧性地睁开。在他这么做的时候，美里走到自己的桌前，一屁股坐进椅子里。她的手指穿过头发，确实感觉有点油腻。她已经开始感到疲倦了。

She frowned as Kaji sat on the opposite chair. "Who told you to sit?"  
她皱眉看着加持坐在对面的椅子上。"谁让你坐下的？"

"You want me to stand?"  
"你想让我站着？"

"How about leaving?" “不如离开吧？”

Kaji grinned, looking around. He reached out and turned the coffee pot slightly. "Much cleaner than I thought it'd be, Katsuragi. I'm impressed. Maybe people do change."  
加持咧嘴一笑，环顾四周。他伸出手，轻轻转动咖啡壶。“比我想象的要干净多了，葛城。我印象深刻。或许人真的会变。”

Misato could see a certain amount of longing and bitterness beneath that disgustingly confident smirk. She suppressed a sigh and stared at his face without a word. In silence, two adult children exchanged unspoken words. Or not.  
美里能从那令人厌恶的自信微笑下看到一丝渴望和苦涩。她压下叹息，一言不发地盯着他的脸。沉默中，两个成年孩子交换着未说出口的话语。或者说，并非如此。

Misato broke the silence first, with a sad smile on her lips. "It was Shinji. He cleans and cooks, you know."  
美里率先打破了沉默，嘴角带着一丝哀伤的微笑。“是真嗣。他会打扫和做饭，你知道的。”

One corner of Kaji's mouth crept up. "Huh, now I feel pathetic. So this is what they call 'signs of a new boyfriend', eh?"  
加持的嘴角微微上扬。“哼，现在我觉得自己挺可怜的。这就是他们所说的‘新男友的迹象’吗？”

Misato giggled, despite everything. "I don't think I'd go that far. Asuka would never forgive me, for one thing."  
尽管如此，美里还是轻声笑了出来。“我觉得还没到那一步。光是明日香就不会原谅我，这是其一。”

Kaji said nothing, a strange smile on his face. Misato sighed quietly, wondering what that expression meant, wondering if she'd told him about the weird atmosphere between Shinji and Asuka. Then she figured she was too tired for any of it.  
加持什么也没说，脸上挂着一种奇怪的微笑。美里轻轻叹了口气，不知道他那表情是什么意思，也不知道自己是否告诉过他真嗣和明日香之间那诡异的气氛。随后她觉得，自己太累了，不想再理会这些。

"I'm busy. So is Ritsuko. Why don't you go home, Inspector?"  
“我很忙。律子也是。你为什么不回家呢，警探？”

Kaji nodded with a weird spark in his eyes. "Yeah, you must be very busy. It was a crazy day."  
加持点点头，眼中闪过一丝异样的光芒。“是啊，你们肯定很忙。今天真是疯狂的一天。”

Misato felt something stick in her throat.  
美里感觉有什么东西卡在了喉咙里。

"Hey, about today's blackout…you don't happen to know anything about it, do you?"  
“嘿，关于今天的停电……你该不会知道些什么吧？”

"I told you, I was stuck in the elevator the whole time. You want me to produce a witness or something?"  
“我说过了，我整晚都被困在电梯里。你是想让我找个目击者还是怎么的？”

Misato narrowed her eyes. "I asked you if you knew anything, not if you did it. What kind of answer is that?"  
美里眯起了眼睛。“我问你是否知道些什么，不是问你是否做了。你这算什么回答？”

Kaji stood up, smiling. "Quite good at leading questions, aren't you? I'm afraid I've got to run now."  
加持站起身，微笑着。“很擅长引导问题嘛，你？恐怕我现在得走了。”

Misato glared at him. He stopped at the door and looked back.  
美里瞪着他。他在门口停下，回头望了一眼。

"Oh, one more thing. Maybe it's none of my business, but is it really all right, Katsuragi? Just leaving those kids by themselves at home?"  
“哦，还有件事。或许这不关我的事，但真的没关系吗，葛城？就这样让那些孩子独自在家？”

Misato shrugged. "What are you even implying? It's all right. After all, Shinji is a coward to the bone. He won't try anything. His father did one hell of a number on him. No need to worry."  
美里耸了耸肩。“你到底想暗示什么？没事的。毕竟，真嗣是个彻头彻尾的胆小鬼。他不会做什么出格的事。他父亲把他吓得够呛。不用担心。”

Kaji's eyes narrowed. He seemed to have something more to say. But after standing there for a few moments, he left without a word, just nodding to Misato on his way out.  
加持的眼睛眯了起来。他似乎还有话要说。但站在那里片刻后，他一言不发地离开了，只是在出门时向美里点了点头。

---

Shinji swallowed. Nothing went down his throat. It just felt numb after dozens of repeated attempts over the past few minutes. He turned from the door of Asuka's room toward the hallway and checked the clock in the living room. It was pointing at 11:55.  
真嗣咽了咽口水。什么也没咽下去，只是喉咙在过去的几分钟内尝试了数十次后变得麻木。他转身从明日香的房间门口走向走廊，查看客厅的时钟。指针指向 11:55。

Five minutes to the deadline.  
距离最后期限还有五分钟。

He didn't exactly spend the past few hours doing nothing. He just didn't have a proper chance. Not when Asuka appeared in that vent where he was stuck under the Angel, nor when they struggled out of the entry plugs after the battle, nor when they finished the debriefing, still covered in LCL. Nor when they were sent home in a Section 2 vehicle. Nor when they rescued Penpen, who was trapped in his refrigerator. Nor after they took turns showering once the water came back on. Every time Asuka was within reasonable reach of him, he really wanted to tell her his answer. That he, regardless if it was real or an act, wanted to be close to her. But every time there was something to stop him from doing so. The Angel, Ayanami, Misato, Section 2 agents, Penpen.  
他并非真的在过去几小时里无所事事。只是没有合适的机会。不是在天使袭击时明日香出现在通风口，也不是战斗结束后他们挣扎着从插入栓里出来，更不是在简报会上仍浑身沾满 LCL 的时候。也不是被第二分部的人送回家时，或是他们救出被困在冰箱里的 Penpen 时。甚至在水恢复供应后轮流洗澡时也没有。每当明日香离他足够近时，他真的很想告诉她他的答案。无论这是真实的还是一场表演，他都想靠近她。但每次总有事情阻止他这么做。天使、绫波、美里、第二分部的特工、Penpen。

In the meantime, Asuka did not speak to him any more than was totally necessary. A few barked orders during the battle were pretty much the only things she said to him. A few minutes ago, after a strangely long shower, she came out of the bathroom and threw a glare at Shinji, who was sitting at the kitchen table minding his own business. Even then nothing was said by either party, and she silently went to her room.  
与此同时，明日香与他交谈的次数仅限于绝对必要之时。战斗中几声简短的命令几乎是她对他说的全部。几分钟前，在一场异常漫长的淋浴后，她走出浴室，对坐在厨房桌旁自顾自的碇真嗣投以一瞥。即便如此，双方都未发一言，她默默地回到了自己的房间。

_What should I do? Should I just open the door and go in? Why didn't she just wait in the living room or something, where it's more accessible?_ Shinji lifted his shaking hand and grasped the door handle. A whimper escaped from between his lips, making him feel all the more pathetic.  
我该怎么办？我应该直接开门进去吗？她为什么不就在客厅之类更容易接触的地方等呢？真嗣颤抖的手握住了门把手。一声呜咽从他唇间逸出，让他感觉更加可怜。

He blamed his father for it. Whatever courage for attempting any kind of human relationship he'd gathered in the past few months had all evaporated this morning. But if he didn't…  
他将这一切归咎于他的父亲。过去几个月里积累的任何尝试建立人际关系的勇气，都在今早消失殆尽。但如果他不……

Shinji heard a whimper again, this time through the door. It was neither his imagination nor his own. He froze for a moment, then opened the door slightly, just so he could peek inside.  
真嗣再次听到了一声呜咽，这次是从门后传来的。这既不是他的幻觉，也不是他自己的声音。他愣了一会儿，然后轻轻地打开门，只是为了能偷看里面。

Unlike the storeroom where he was sleeping these days, Asuka's was a proper room with a window, so moonlight seeping through the curtain illuminated the scene. Asuka crouched on her bed with her back toward the door, her body covered in a blanket. Her hair was loose, her A-10 connectors absent.  
与这些天他睡的储藏室不同，明日香的房间是个有窗户的正规房间，所以月光透过窗帘照亮了这一幕。明日香背对着门蹲在床上，身上盖着一条毯子。她的头发散落着，A-10 连接器不见了。

While Shinji held his breath, Asuka moaned softly and pulled the blanket hard. After a few moments, a hand emerged from beneath the blanket to press on her back.  
当真嗣屏住呼吸时，明日香轻轻地呻吟着，用力拉紧了毯子。过了一会儿，一只手从毯子下伸出来，按在她的背上。

Shinji, bewitched by the scene, realized what he was looking at after a long pause.  
真嗣被眼前的景象所迷惑，经过长时间的停顿后才意识到自己在看什么。

Back. Pain. Pressure. 背部。疼痛。压迫感。

But Asuka said she never had that problem, that phantom pain was something only inexperienced fresh blood like him had to deal with. Shinji was confused, but even the confusion didn't change what he was seeing with his own eyes. It wasn't even important right now.  
但明日香说她从未遇到过那种问题，那种幻痛只是像他这样缺乏经验的新手才会经历的。真嗣感到困惑，但即便如此，他亲眼所见的事实并未改变。眼下这甚至都不重要了。

The important thing was how to deal with this.  
关键在于如何处理这件事。

The first solution that came to him was to just close the door and forget he saw anything. Nothing could have been easier and more comfortable than that. But, but…Shinji needed to confront Asuka right now, and above all, he owed her for helping him with the very same thing when he was in the hospital.  
他首先想到的解决办法是直接关门，假装什么都没看见。没有什么比这更简单、更舒适的了。但是，但是……真嗣现在需要面对明日香，最重要的是，他欠她一个人情，因为在他住院时她也曾帮助过他。

But…what was he supposed to do?  
但是……他应该怎么做呢？

Shinji already knew the answer. He just didn't have the courage to act.  
真嗣其实早已知道答案。他只是缺乏采取行动的勇气。

The next moment, however, Asuka sobbed a little louder than before. Shinji unthinkingly opened the door and walked inside, his fear forgotten in that fleeting instant. What filled his mind instead was the memory of how terrible his own phantom pain episodes were, and how much of a difference Asuka's help made in the few cases when she was there for him. When he wasn't alone.  
然而下一刻，明日香比之前哭得更大声了。真嗣不假思索地推开门走了进去，那一瞬间他忘记了恐惧。取而代之占据他脑海的是自己经历过的那些可怕的幻痛发作，以及明日香在场时对他产生的巨大帮助。当他不是独自一人时。

Perhaps it was not a perfect, selfless sense of care and understanding for Asuka's pain in and of itself, but rather an extension of his own self-care, as he was basing his assumptions on his own experiences, not hers. Empathy borne of shared experience. And that made him feel terrible, but at least he was sincere, and there was no hesitation.  
或许这并非出于对明日香痛苦的完美无私的关怀与理解，而更多是基于自身经历的自我关怀的延伸。这种共鸣源自共同的经历。这让他感到糟糕，但至少他是真诚的，没有丝毫犹豫。

Just as in the volcano, he didn't hesitate to stretch out his hand and press Asuka's back. Asuka shuddered as if she had been administered an electric shock.  
正如在火山中一样，他毫不犹豫地伸出手，按在明日香的后背上。明日香颤抖了一下，仿佛被电击了一般。

"What are you doing?" she hissed after a few tense moments. She neither turned around nor looked at him.  
“你在干什么？”几秒钟紧张的对峙后，她低声质问。她既没有转身，也没有看他。

Shinji's courage, in a way, was closer to paralysis brought on by fear than true courage. Asuka's hostile reaction, however small and relatively meek, triggered that fear, and the desire to just turn back and run from the room started to fill his head again. Reminding himself that he shouldn't run away, he opened his mouth after a brief struggle. "P, pressure, as, as you said before…"  
某种程度上，真嗣的勇气更接近于因恐惧而导致的瘫痪，而非真正的勇气。尽管明日香的敌意反应微小且相对温和，却再次触发了他的恐惧，想要转身逃离房间的念头又开始充斥他的脑海。在短暂的挣扎后，他提醒自己不应逃避，于是开口说道：“压，压力，就，就像你之前说的那样……”

Asuka didn't reply to that. Shinji, taking it as permission, raised his other hand and placed it on Asuka's back beside the other. He could feel her body heat through the thin blanket. His position was a bit awkward, so Shinji carefully climbed onto Asuka's bed and knelt down behind her. Asuka didn't react to that either.  
明日香没有回应。真嗣将其视为允许，举起另一只手，放在明日香背上另一侧。他能透过薄薄的毯子感受到她的体温。他的姿势有些别扭，于是真嗣小心翼翼地爬上明日香的床，跪在她身后。明日香对此也没有任何反应。

As he sat behind her, he now saw a dull red glow on the blankets in front of her. Shinji tilted his head slightly to look over her shoulder. A rectangular digital clock, the kind that's usually placed on a bedside table, was at Asuka's feet on the bed. It read 11:57.  
当他坐在她身后时，他现在看到她面前的毯子上有一抹暗淡的红光。真嗣微微侧头，从她的肩膀上看过去。一个长方形的数字时钟，通常放在床头柜上的那种，就在明日香脚边的床上。它显示着 11:57。

The first thing that came to his mind was the realization that Asuka was counting down the minutes. And the second, which hit his head like a hammer was…  
他首先意识到的是明日香在倒数时间。而第二个念头，像锤子一样击中他的脑袋的是……

It was the fact that he had only three minutes left. Three minutes before Asuka would truly hate him forever.  
事实是他只剩下三分钟了。三分钟后，明日香将永远真正地恨他。

Shinji's chest tightened. First he had to calm Asuka down, and then calm himself down, and finally strike up a conversation.  
真嗣的胸口一紧。首先他得让明日香冷静下来，然后让自己冷静下来，最后再开始交谈。

"… not enough." “……不够。”

Shinji blinked. "What?" 真嗣眨了眨眼。"什么？"

Asuka lowered her head. The motion revealed the back of her neck over the blanket, and Shinji was instantly distracted. The skin there was smooth and pale, with wispy little auburn hairs extending over it from her hairline.  
明日香低下头。这个动作让她颈后的肌肤从毯子上方露了出来，这让真嗣立刻分了心。那里的皮肤光滑而苍白，几缕淡红色的细发从她的发际线延伸覆盖其上。

"The pressure, I mean," she murmured, jolting him back to the present. "It's not enough."  
“我是说，压力，”她低声呢喃，将他拉回现实。“还不够。”

Shinji licked his lips. "Should I press harder?"  
真嗣舔了舔嘴唇。“我应该按得更重些吗？”

Asuka shook her head. "It melted my whole back, all the way down to the waist. Hands aren't enough, and the blanket feels too rough. It's grating on my skin."  
明日香摇了摇头。“它把我整个背部都融化了，一直烧到腰际。手不够用，而且毯子摸起来太粗糙了。摩擦得我皮肤生疼。”

_What am I supposed to do?_ Shinji wanted to ask, but hesitated instead. Asuka answered his unspoken question with action. The blanket fell from her shoulders, revealing bare skin. She was completely naked, at least on her upper body. Shinji was so shocked he forgot to breathe.  
我该怎么办？真嗣想问，却犹豫了。明日香用行动回答了他未说出口的问题。毯子从她肩上滑落，露出光洁的皮肤。她上半身一丝不挂。真嗣震惊得忘记了呼吸。

"If you're not going to do it, then don't. If you are, then commit yourself properly. I don't want any half measures."  
“如果你不打算做，那就别做。如果你要做，那就认真点。我不接受半吊子。”

He gasped audibly. The clock, which he could still see over her shoulder, was now at 58 minutes. That was weird, because he felt like three hours had passed since he entered her room.  
他明显地倒抽了一口气。他还能从她肩头看到的时钟，现在显示着 58 分钟。这很奇怪，因为他感觉自从他进入她的房间已经过去了三个小时。

The rustling sound of Asuka gathering up the blanket brought Shinji to his senses. "Make it quick," she said. "If you don't like what you see, then get out. And don't come back ever again."  
明日香整理毯子的沙沙声让真嗣回过神来。“快点，”她说，“如果你不喜欢你所看到的，那就出去。而且永远不要再回来。”

Shinji leaned forward, feeling like he was climbing into a trap. He almost always felt this way whenever he interacted with Asuka.  
真嗣向前倾身，感觉自己像是在踏入一个陷阱。每当他与明日香互动时，他几乎总是有这种感觉。

_This is what she wanted. She's demanding it. It's to relieve her pain and help her, and there's no other ulterior motive,_ he kept telling himself.  
这就是她想要的。她在要求这个。这是为了缓解她的痛苦并帮助她，并没有其他不可告人的动机，他不断这样告诉自己。

As if mocking his thoughts, Shinji's groin stiffened like never before. The moment before their bodies made contact, Shinji recalled that Asuka said that her blanket was too rough for her skin. He didn't think his nightshirt was much softer, but removing it was unthinkable, so he just kept going, forgetting the whole idea. As soon as her back and his chest met, Asuka moaned softly. Her shoulders, as stiff as Shinji's until moments ago, melted against his torso. He took back his waist as much as he could while still maintaining contact between them. Asuka elbowed him in the ribs, not too hard, but enough to make him gasp with surprise.  
仿佛在嘲笑他的想法，真嗣的下体前所未有地硬挺起来。在他们身体接触的前一刻，真嗣回想起明日香说过她的毯子对她的皮肤来说太粗糙了。他不认为自己的睡衣会柔软多少，但脱掉它是不可能的，所以他继续前进，忘记了整个想法。当她的背和他的胸膛接触时，明日香轻轻地呻吟了一声。她的肩膀，直到刚才还和真嗣的一样僵硬，现在却在他胸前融化了。他尽可能地收回腰部，同时仍然保持他们之间的接触。明日香用肘部轻轻撞了他的肋骨，力度不大，但足以让他惊讶地喘息。

"Did you forget what I said?"  
“你忘了我说过的话吗？”

_No half measures,_ he recalled. Sweat ran down his forehead. As if hypnotized, Shinji put his hands on her shoulders and canted his hips so that her back was fully pressed against his front. Now that he'd almost given up, he somehow felt braver than before. If Asuka had ever once laughed at him or sent a negative signal, he would have collapsed and run away, but she did none of those things, fortunately for both of them. Instead, Asuka leaned back into his arms.  
没有半途而废，他回想起。汗水顺着他的额头流下。仿佛被催眠一般，真嗣将双手放在她的肩上，倾斜着臀部，使她的背部完全紧贴在他的前身。现在他几乎放弃了，却不知为何比之前更加勇敢。如果明日香曾经嘲笑过他或发出过负面信号，他可能早已崩溃并逃走，但幸运的是，她没有做这些事情。相反，明日香向后靠进了他的怀抱。

They were hugging, there was no other way to put it. And that terrified Shinji. He told himself that it was not at all different from what they did back in Unit-02, that they had as much physical contact then as now. That this situation was fundamentally the same, two people mutually tolerating each other to achieve a greater goal. The other explanation for this situation, that he was embracing her and that she was _letting_ him, was too frightening and obscene for him to handle.  
他们在拥抱，没有其他方式可以形容。这使真嗣感到恐惧。他告诉自己，这与他们在二号机中的行为并无不同，那时他们的身体接触与现在一样多。这种情况本质上是一样的，两个人相互容忍以达到更大的目标。另一种解释，即他在拥抱她而她允许他这样做，对他来说太过可怕和淫秽，无法承受。

Then, just like the last time they were in Unit-02, Asuka moved her hands to hold his. The hands that were awkwardly gripping her shoulders. Asuka snorted as Shinji's body stiffened again.  
然后，就像上次他们在二号机中一样，明日香移动她的手去握住他的手。那双笨拙地抓着她肩膀的手。明日香哼了一声，真嗣的身体再次僵硬起来。

"I'm keeping them tied up so they don't do anything naughty."  
"我得把它们绑起来，免得它们做坏事。"

"Uh, okay." "呃，好吧。"

But, after some confused fumbling, Shinji's hands ended up folded around Asuka's, not the other way around. She didn't seem bothered by that at all. Shinji focused all of his attention on his hands to distract himself from everything else. Asuka's warmth, the feeling of her body pressed against him, the smell of her shampoo and that raging erection of his that refused to go away. He felt something rough beneath his fingertip. It was Asuka's fingernail. Her right index finger, maybe.  
但在一阵混乱的摸索后，真嗣的手最终环绕在明日香的手上，而非相反。她似乎对此毫不在意。真嗣全神贯注于自己的双手，以此分散自己对其他一切的注意力。明日香身体的温暖，她紧贴着他的感觉，她洗发水的香味，以及他那不肯消退的勃起。他感觉到指尖下有些粗糙的东西。那是明日香的指甲。或许是她的右食指。

"Did you break your nail, Asuka? Did you get hurt in the battle?"  
"你指甲断了，惣流？战斗中受伤了吗？"

Asuka's body trembled slightly. It took Shinji a moment to realize it was because she was laughing. "No. It's…never mind. It's nothing."  
惣流的身体微微颤抖。真嗣一时没反应过来，原来她是在笑。“没有。只是……算了，没什么。”

And then it was Shinji's turn to tremble. Not to laugh, but because a few strands of Asuka's hair ended up in his nostrils and tickled him. He felt like sneezing, so he tried to use his hands to brush them away. Asuka didn't let him, her fingers twining through his.  
接着轮到真嗣颤抖了。不是因为笑，而是因为几缕惣流的头发钻进了他的鼻孔，痒得他想打喷嚏。他试图用手把头发拨开，但惣流不让，她的手指缠绕在他的手上。

"What are you doing?" “你在做什么？”

"Your, ha, hair…" "你，哈，头发…"

Asuka lowered and shook her head. All the strands left Shinji's nose but as a result, her hair slapped Shinji's cheek.  
明日香低下头并摇了摇。所有的发丝离开了真嗣的鼻子，但作为结果，她的头发拍在了真嗣的脸颊上。

"It's rough, isn't it?" she asked. "Dry, too?"  
"很粗糙，对吧？"她问道。"也很干？"

Asuka's voice was low. Shinji nodded, and then, realizing it was impossible for her to see him, hurriedly opened his mouth. "Well, a little."  
明日香的声音很低。真嗣点点头，随即意识到她不可能看到他，急忙张嘴回答：“嗯，有一点。”

It surprised him. Asuka's hair shone so beautifully from a distance, like melted copper, but up close, the strands were much thinner, weaker, and more brittle than he ever would've expected.  
这让他感到惊讶。从远处看，明日香的头发闪耀着美丽的光芒，宛如熔化的铜，但近距离观察时，那些发丝却比他预想的要细得多，脆弱得多，也更加易碎。

"It's because I pilot Eva."  
“这都是因为我驾驶 EVA。”

He was mesmerized by her almost dreamy voice. The clock was showing 59 minutes, and he knew he had no more time to spend on idle chit chat, but Shinji could not stop her. Not now.  
他被她那近乎梦幻的声音深深吸引。时钟显示着 59 分钟，他知道不能再浪费时间闲聊了，但真嗣无法阻止她。现在不行。

"LCL doesn't wash off easily, so sometimes I use shampoo more than three times a day. And I lived like that for years. No matter what I do, nutrition creams, whatever, the LCL goes deeper than all of it. I bet I'll lose half of my hair by the time I turn 20 or something."  
“LCL 不容易洗掉，所以我有时一天要用三次以上的洗发水。多年来我一直这样生活。无论我做什么，用营养霜什么的，LCL 都比这些更深入。我敢打赌，到我 20 岁时，头发会掉一半。”

Shinji had nothing to say to that, and Asuka didn't seem to expect an answer anyway, so he kept quiet. Until a sense of urgency compelled him to speak.  
真嗣对此无言以对，而明日香似乎也并不期待他的回答，所以他保持沉默。直到一种紧迫感驱使他开口。

"Asuka…" "明日香…"

Asuka tilted her head. "Hmm?"  
明日香歪了歪头。"嗯？"

"What you said in the morning…"  
“你早上说的那些话……”

Shinji swallowed and checked the clock again. It was still 59 minutes, which means he still had a chance, but that door was closing, and fast.  
真嗣咽了口唾沫，再次看了看时钟。还是 59 分钟，这意味着他还有机会，但那扇门正在迅速关闭。

"I…I…" "我…我…"

He felt Asuka's body straining. Shinji forced his knotted stomach to calm down and opened his mouth again.  
他感觉到明日香的身躯紧绷。真嗣强压下纠结的胃部，再次张开了嘴。

"I…"

Asuka sighed. "Just shut up. Your mouth is your own worst enemy, you know."  
明日香叹了口气。“闭嘴吧。你的嘴巴是你自己最大的敌人，知道吗？”

The whole world shook, or at least Shinji felt like it did. And he thought that everything was going so well. Too well. Almost like a dream. Reality was never this kind to him, but he forgot about that for a moment. His erection, so ardent before, quickly disappeared. As he watched, the clock finally marked midnight. Tears welled up in Shinji's eyes. It was so unfair, to get cut off and mocked like that in the middle of his speech. _She never wanted to give me a chance,_ he realized. _It was a lie from the start._  
整个世界仿佛都在颤抖，至少真嗣感觉如此。他原以为一切都在顺利进行，太顺利了，几乎像是一场梦。现实从未对他如此仁慈，但他一时忘记了这一点。他之前那般强烈的欲望迅速消退。当他注视着时钟终于指向午夜，泪水涌上了真嗣的眼眶。这太不公平了，在演讲中途被打断并嘲笑。他意识到，她从未想给我机会，从一开始就是个谎言。

As if to rub salt in the wound, his torturer sighed almost contentedly and leaned back into him even more. Shinji quietly clenched his teeth. He'd never experienced time passing so slowly and painfully in his life. After three minutes which felt like thirty hours, Asuka finally spoke.  
仿佛要在伤口上撒盐，他的折磨者几乎满意地叹了口气，更加向后靠在他身上。真嗣默默地咬紧牙关。他从未经历过如此缓慢而痛苦的时间流逝。在感觉像是三十个小时的三分钟后，明日香终于开口了。

"That's enough. You can go now."  
“够了。你可以走了。”

_I've served my purpose, you mean,_ Shinji thought bitterly. He got up without a word and headed briskly for the door. When Asuka wished him _good night_ in a whisper, he pretended not to hear her, not even sparing her a glance.  
你是说我已经没用了吧，真嗣苦涩地想。他一言不发地站起来，快步向门口走去。当明日香低声向他道晚安时，他假装没听见，连看都没看她一眼。

When he got back to his room, Shinji buried his face in a pillow and sobbed himself to sleep.  
回到自己的房间后，真嗣把脸埋在枕头里，哭着哭着就睡着了。

The next morning, Shinji gathered himself up and treated his two roommates as professionally as possible. That's what Asuka wanted, wasn't it? Breakfast, lunch, and everything else were taken care of as usual, with no unnecessary words exchanged, not even a simple greeting. Asuka also kept her distance from Shinji, almost shy in the way she refused to look at him. Poor Penpen was noticeably depressed, sensing the tense atmosphere but not having a clue why it was like that.  
次日清晨，真嗣振作精神，尽可能专业地对待他的两位室友。这不正是明日香想要的吗？早餐、午餐以及一切照常打理，没有多余的言语交流，甚至连简单的问候都省略了。明日香也与真嗣保持距离，她拒绝直视他的方式近乎羞涩。可怜的 Penpen 明显感到沮丧，它察觉到紧张的气氛，却不知其所以然。

The tight silence was broken when Asuka finished preparing for school. She, out of nowhere, demanded that Shinji see her to the crosswalk in front of the apartment. The ridiculous demand took him off guard, but he conceded, not wanting to argue. After he changed into outdoor clothes, Asuka's gaze began to harbor a sting, first from the doorway. By the time they got to the elevator, it had evolved into a glare. After an elevator ride that felt like it cut years off of his life expectancy, Shinji stepped through the open door, but Asuka stomped ahead and cut him off, her fists clenched and shoulders stiff.  
当明日香准备好去学校时，这紧绷的沉默被打破了。她突然要求真嗣送她到公寓前的斑马线。这个无理的要求让他措手不及，但他还是妥协了，不想争执。换上外出服后，明日香的目光开始带有刺意，从门口开始。等他们到达电梯时，这目光已演变成瞪视。一段感觉缩短了他几年寿命的电梯之旅后，真嗣踏出电梯门，但明日香抢先一步，拳头紧握，肩膀僵硬。

"What the hell is wrong with you now?"  
“你他妈现在又怎么了？”

Shinji was surprised by her aggressive attitude. "But now we're supposed to, you know. The time limit. You hate me, don't you?"  
真嗣被她咄咄逼人的态度吓了一跳。“但现在我们得，你知道的。时间限制。你讨厌我，对吧？”

Asuka's eyebrows gathered to form almost a single line. Shinji's heart sank. This reaction was completely incomprehensible. _Now what?!_  
明日香的眉毛几乎拧成了一条线。真嗣的心沉了下去。这种反应完全无法理解。现在怎么办？！

Asuka closed her eyes tightly and shook her head.  
明日香紧紧闭上眼睛，摇了摇头。

And grabbed Shinji's hand and started dragging him along with her.  
然后抓住了真嗣的手，开始拉着他一起走。

"Asuka?" Shinji almost tripped because she was walking so fast.  
“明日香？”真嗣差点绊倒，因为她走得太快了。

"You have a lot of free time now that you're suspended. Make yourself useful for a change and come up with a plan for this weekend."  
“你被停职后现在有很多空闲时间。这次就让自己变得有用一点，想个周末的计划吧。”

"What?" "什么？"

Asuka looked back at Shinji with a ferocious smile, tugging him hard.  
明日香回头看着真嗣，露出凶猛的笑容，用力拽着他。

"Are you an idiot? You accepted my offer when you hugged me last night. That means we'll have to pretend to date!"  
“你是白痴吗？你昨晚抱住我的时候就接受了我的提议。这意味着我们得假装在交往！”

Shinji froze, making Asuka abruptly stop. His mouth was agape.  
真嗣僵住了，让明日香突然停下。他张大了嘴巴。

"Oh."

### Chapter 9 Same, but not the same

Kyoto, back when Japan had winter.  
京都，在那个日本还有冬天的年代。

He was much more cautious today than usual since the road was frozen and there was snow everywhere. He had gotten his driver's license many years ago but he had only bought his first car(a used Honda Life that smelled faintly of cigarettes) after he started dating her, which meant that this was his first time driving on an icy road.  
今天他比平时更加谨慎，因为路面结冰，到处都是雪。他多年前就拿到了驾照，但直到和她开始交往后才买了自己的第一辆车（一辆二手的本田 Life，车内隐约有一股烟味），这意味着这是他第一次在冰面上开车。

The girl in the passenger seat was silent as he slowly navigated the quiet streets. It was unusual for her to be this quiet, but she'd had a long day after all, going straight from class to a date with him. He'd dismissed her silence as simple exhaustion until he couldn't anymore. The thing that lived in the shadowy parts of his mind started to gnaw at him, wondering if maybe it was somehow his fault. He hated that feeling, so he opened his mouth, breaking the silence.  
副驾驶座上的女孩在他缓缓驶过寂静的街道时一直沉默不语。她平时很少这么安静，但毕竟她今天从课堂直接赶来和他约会，想必是累坏了。他起初以为她的沉默只是因为疲惫，但后来这种想法再也站不住脚。他内心深处那个阴影中的存在开始啃噬他的思绪，怀疑是不是自己哪里做错了。他讨厌这种感觉，于是开口打破了沉默。

"You tired?" “你累了吗？”

Her thick winter coat rustled as she shook her head with a faint smile. "No."  
她厚重的冬衣随着她轻轻摇头而沙沙作响，嘴角带着一丝微笑。“不。”

"I thought-" “我以为——”

"Shall we go to your place tonight?"  
“今晚我们去你那儿好吗？”

He put his right-turn signal on and turned the wheel slowly, frowning.  
他打开了右转信号灯，缓缓转动方向盘，皱起了眉头。

"Well, it's too late for that today."  
“好吧，今天已经太晚了。”

A thoughtful noise from her. "Are you hiding something in your house? It seems you're doing your absolute best not to take me there."  
她发出了一声深思的声音。“你家里是不是藏了什么东西？看起来你尽全力不想带我去那里。”

There was nothing special about his little studio apartment, and that was exactly the reason he didn't want to show it to her. Everything about her screamed old money, and he was not about to confirm whatever she suspected about him already. Of course, he couldn't say that, so he just smiled.  
他的小工作室公寓并无特别之处，而这正是他不想让她看到的原因。她的一切都透露着老钱气息，他可不想证实她对他已有的一切猜疑。当然，他不能这么说，所以他只是笑了笑。

"Not really. It's because we're already close to your mansion." He pointed to the road sign that just popped up in their view ahead. "It would be too much trouble to turn back now. The professor's heart would break if his beloved pupil dozed off during his lecture. We wouldn't want that, now would we?"  
“并不是。只是因为我们已经离你的豪宅很近了。”他指向刚刚出现在他们视野中的路标。“现在折返太麻烦了。教授的心会碎的，如果他心爱的学生在他的课上打瞌睡。我们可不想那样，对吧？”

She snorted. It promised that she would get what she wanted one day and that he could not stop her forever. He changed the subject, knowing that doing so was in his best interest.  
她哼了一声，暗示总有一天她会得到她想要的，而他无法永远阻止她。他改变了话题，知道这样做最符合他的利益。

"So, what were you thinking about all this time?"  
"那么，这段时间你一直在想什么呢？"

"Nothing serious. About the movie."  
"没什么严肃的。关于那部电影。"

Her answer was fast, considering she went out of her way to avoid this topic just a moment ago. Maybe the whole thing about his house was a trick to buy some time to think up an answer and seeing his place didn't even matter much to her. Or it _did_ matter and she just wanted to weasel in another way while also buying some time. He was not a slow person by any measure, but he was not used to mind games like this, especially against a woman who liked him, so he often felt an unpleasant confusion in these kinds of situations.  
她的回答很快，考虑到她刚才还特意避开这个话题。也许关于他家的整件事只是为了争取时间想出一个答案，而看他的地方对她来说并不重要。或者确实重要，她只是想用另一种方式巧妙地进入话题，同时也争取一些时间。他绝不是一个迟钝的人，但他不习惯这种心理游戏，尤其是面对一个喜欢他的女人，所以他经常在这些情况下感到一种不愉快的困惑。

He shook his head. 他摇了摇头。

"Really? It was a nice action flick, not the kind that requires much thinking."  
"真的吗？那是一部不错的动作片，不需要太多思考的那种。"

"It just made me wonder. What kind of love that was.. And it always happens to men, you know. Whether it's a movie or a book."  
"它只是让我思考。那是怎样的一种爱……而且这种事总是发生在男人身上，你知道的。无论是电影还是书籍。"

He snorted. "He must have been very lonely living his whole life as a priest. A single taste of warmth was enough to drive him mad. So when he lost that warmth his mind went with it. An obsession that transcended even life and death."  
他哼了一声。"他一定很孤独，一辈子都过着神父的生活。一丝温暖就足以让他疯狂。所以当他失去那份温暖时，他的心也随之而去。一种超越生死的执念。"

"Hmm, an immortal love, then?"  
"嗯，一段永恒的爱情，是吗？"

Carefully turning on the slippery road, he clicked his tongue. "More like an eternal madness. And pretty unrealistic. It's romanticized like that only because it's a movie. In reality, a person's mind doesn't work like that."  
他小心翼翼地行驶在湿滑的道路上，咂了咂嘴。"更像是一场永恒的疯狂。而且相当不切实际。只有在电影里才会被浪漫化。现实中，人的心智并非如此运作。"

A short laugh. "That's cold, eh?"  
一声短促的笑声。"真冷酷，是吧？"

He reached for the center fascia. "Want me to turn the heater up?"  
他伸手去摸中央控制面板。“需要我把暖气调高吗？”

She laughed again. "No wonder you've never had a girlfriend before."  
她又笑了。“难怪你以前没交过女朋友。”

He smiled, but it wasn't a completely comfortable one. Because hers was the kind of joke that brought back old questions that had started plaguing him since they met.  
他笑了笑，但那笑容并不完全自在。因为她的玩笑勾起了那些自他们相遇以来就一直困扰着他的旧问题。

_What is it that you see in me? What do you see that I can't when I look in a mirror? What did you catch in my face that all the people for over 30 years haven't?_ These were terrifying questions, ones he wished he could get answers for but didn't dare ask. So, instead, he did what he was good at. Smirking and winging it.  
你在我身上看到了什么？你看到了什么是我自己照镜子时看不到的？你从我脸上捕捉到了什么，是过去三十年里所有人都没有发现的？这些问题令人恐惧，他希望能得到答案，却又不敢问出口。因此，他选择了自己擅长的方式。轻蔑一笑，随机应变。

"If I had to pick, that was the most unbelievable part of the movie. Such a thing cannot happen in the real world."  
如果非要选一个，那电影中最不可思议的部分就是那个。这种事在现实世界中是不可能发生的。

She rustled slightly as she shook her head. "Mummies are running amok and shooting magic spells and you're fine, but eternal love is where you draw the line?"  
她轻轻摇了摇头，发出细微的摩擦声。“木乃伊四处乱窜，施展魔法，你都无所谓，但永恒的爱情却让你无法接受？”

He craned his head slightly to check the left lane, smiling.  
他微微伸长脖子查看左车道，微笑着。

"What's wrong with mummies? You're majoring in metaphysical biology, you of all people shouldn't talk shit about mummies."  
“木乃伊有什么问题？你主修超自然生物学，你最不该对木乃伊说三道四。”

She giggled and reached out, messing up his hair. "Mr. Rokubungi, what a mouth you have. It would be so nice if that big mouth of yours was half as good at other things."  
她咯咯笑着，伸出手弄乱他的头发。“六部木先生，你的嘴巴可真厉害。要是你那张大嘴在其他事情上也有一半的能耐就好了。”

Gendo Rokubungi was not someone to easily shrug off an insult. And Yui's voice, as was often the case, had a slight sharp edge of mockery, even if it was a joke. But her insults had never managed to anger him yet. Either she had some special talent, or he was deeply in love. Or both.  
源堂·六分仪并非轻易能被侮辱所动摇之人。而正如常有的情况，唯的声音带着一丝尖锐的嘲讽，即便那只是个玩笑。但她的侮辱从未能激怒他。要么她有着某种特殊才能，要么他深陷爱河。或者两者皆是。

And he already knew the answer.  
而他早已知晓答案。

### Chapter 10 A progress

Wordlessly, they walked hand in hand, Asuka leading and Shinji following. What was supposed to be a short walk to the crosswalk in front of the apartment complex stretched to the next crosswalk in front of a convenience store, and then across an overpass with no signs of stopping. Not like they verbally agreed to take this detour; Shinji just didn't want to be the one to stop them, and Asuka didn't look like she wanted to either, so they just kept walking, the silence getting more awkward with every step. In this fashion, they reached the hill overlooking the train station.  
他们默默地手牵手走着，明日香在前领路，真嗣紧随其后。原本只是去公寓楼前的斑马线，却不知不觉延长到了便利店前的下一个斑马线，再穿过一座天桥，丝毫没有停下的迹象。并非他们口头约定绕道而行；只是真嗣不想成为那个叫停的人，而明日香似乎也没有这个意思，于是他们就这样继续前行，每一步都让沉默变得更加尴尬。就这样，他们来到了俯瞰火车站的小山丘。

When Asuka let go of his hand as they descended down the slope, Shinji felt as if a huge weight had been lifted from his chest. Only then did he realize that he had been barely breathing the whole time.  
当明日香放开他的手，两人一起滑下斜坡时，真嗣感觉仿佛胸口卸下了一块巨石。直到那时，他才意识到自己几乎一直屏息着。

"Well," Asuka said, "see you later."  
“好吧，”明日香说，“回头见。”

Her head was only half-turned towards Shinji. Asuka's voice was surprisingly flat, almost intimidatingly so. _How are you so calm and nonchalant, like everything is going according to plan, when I don't even know what to say and my heart is racing like crazy?_ he wanted to ask, but then he realized that this was indeed all according to her plan and that she was in charge. Of course she must be feeling differently. All he could do was follow her, barely, but to her this whole thing was the result of careful planning.  
她的头只转向真嗣一半。明日香的声音出奇地平淡，几乎让人感到威胁。你怎么能如此冷静和漫不经心，仿佛一切都在按计划进行，而我连该说什么都不知道，心跳得像疯了一样？他想问，但随即意识到这一切确实都在她的计划之中，她才是掌控者。她当然会有不同的感受。他所能做的只是勉强跟随她，而对她来说，这一切都是精心策划的结果。

It wasn't until he saw Asuka tilting her head slightly that he realized he hadn't answered. He nodded, blushing. "Uh, yeah. Later."  
直到看到明日香微微侧头，他才意识到自己还没回答。他点点头，脸红了。“呃，是的。待会儿见。”

Cars whizzed by them, and the station down the hill was bustling with noise, but on the slope where they stood there was only awkward silence. Shinji stared at the nape of Asuka's neck for a moment and then looked away, realizing it was probably inappropriate to look for too long. The soles of Asuka's shoes scraped loudly against the ground. Asuka had turned to face Shinji.  
车辆在他们身边疾驰而过，山下的车站熙熙攘攘，但在他们所站的斜坡上，只有尴尬的沉默。真嗣盯着明日香的后颈看了一会儿，然后移开视线，意识到盯着看太久可能不太合适。明日香的鞋底在地面上摩擦，发出响亮的声音。明日香转过身来面对真嗣。

"Shinji." “真嗣。”

"Huh?" "啊？"

A strange gleam flashed through Asuka's eyes at Shinji's startled response. He couldn't quite figure out what that could possibly mean, which further complicated his thoughts. Shinji swallowed hard, feeling a tinge of self-doubt creep into his stomach at the thought that maybe she didn't like what she saw, that he was not acting manly enough. Heat rose in his face. It was getting harder and harder to look into her eyes.  
在真嗣惊讶的回应中，明日香眼中闪过一丝奇异的光芒。他无法完全弄清楚这可能意味着什么，这进一步复杂了他的思绪。真嗣艰难地咽了口唾沫，想到也许她不喜欢她所看到的，他表现得不够男子气概，一丝自我怀疑悄然涌上心头。他的脸越来越热，越来越难以直视她的眼睛。

The corner of Asuka's mouth lifted. "Don't forget what I said earlier."  
明日香嘴角微微上扬。“别忘了我之前说的话。”

Shinji's heart skipped a beat. "Yeah."  
真嗣的心跳漏了一拍。“嗯。”

A trace of a smile crossed Asuka's face briefly before she turned. Shinji stood and watched as she walked away, never looking back. Her hair stuck out like a sore thumb amongst the crowd, so he didn't lose sight of her, at least.  
明日香脸上掠过一丝微笑，随即转身离去。真嗣站在原地，目送她渐行渐远，始终未曾回头。她的头发在人群中格外显眼，至少他没跟丢她。

Only after Asuka boarded the train did Shinji turn and head home.  
直到明日香上了火车，真嗣才转身回家。

It was not a long way, objectively speaking, but by the time he got back to the apartment Shinji's heart was pounding and his legs were shaking. He had to take a moment in the elevator to catch his breath, leaning against the wall. His body hadn't fully recovered, and his mind was swirling with a storm of events that he couldn't quite keep up with. It was all too much. Shinji walked through the door and kicked off his shoes. He was halfway across the hallway when Penpen poked his head out of the kitchen door. There was suspicion in his beady eyes, probably because he had never seen his housemate return right after leaving the house in the morning. Shinji chuckled to himself and reached out to stroke the beast's head.  
客观来说，路并不长，但当他回到公寓时，真嗣的心跳加速，双腿颤抖。他不得不在电梯里靠墙休息片刻，喘口气。他的身体尚未完全恢复，脑海中风暴般的事件让他应接不暇。这一切太过沉重。真嗣进门踢掉鞋子，走到一半时，企鹅 Penpen 从厨房门探出头来。它那小眼睛里满是怀疑，大概是因为从未见过室友早上刚出门就回来的情景。真嗣自嘲地笑了笑，伸手抚摸着这只小兽的头。

"Hey, want a treat?" “嘿，想吃点零食吗？”

The penguin shook his head slowly. That was a totally unexpected reaction, but Shinji didn't care, leaning down and hugging Penpen tightly. After a few moments he let go of the utterly confused penguin and returned to his room.  
企鹅缓缓地摇了摇头。这个反应完全出乎意料，但真嗣并不在意，俯身紧紧抱住了 Penpen。片刻后，他松开了这只完全摸不着头脑的企鹅，回到了自己的房间。

Shinji stooped down to pick up and change back into the night clothes he'd taken off earlier, then changed his mind, tossing them on the bed instead. But after grabbing a fresh set of clothes he realized he should shower first before putting them on. Then he decided he just couldn't be bothered with any of them, so he collapsed onto the bed. A giggle burst out of him uncontrollably.  
真嗣弯腰去捡起并换回之前脱下的睡衣，随即又改变了主意，将它们扔在了床上。但在抓起一套干净的衣服后，他意识到应该先洗个澡再穿上。然后他又决定自己实在懒得管这些，于是倒在了床上。一阵笑声不由自主地从他口中爆发出来。

As he stretched out his arms and legs, sighing deeply, he found the now-semi-familiar ceiling looming over him. The sight of it usually left him feeling somewhat claustrophobic, but this time it didn't. Instead, what was swelling like a balloon in his chest was a searing sense of exhilaration that made him wonder if he'd ever felt anything like it in his whole life.  
当他伸展开四肢，深叹一口气时，发现那半熟悉的天花板正笼罩着他。通常看到它会让他感到有些幽闭恐惧，但这次没有。相反，在他胸中膨胀的，是一种炽热的兴奋感，让他怀疑自己一生中是否曾有过这样的感觉。

A girl liked him. Wanted to date him. That alone was unbelievable, but it wasn't just any girl. It was Asuka.  
一个女孩喜欢他，想和他约会。光是这一点就令人难以置信，但这女孩并非寻常之辈，她是明日香。

Sure, there were strange conditions attached to the whole thing, even though he was fairly sure it was a ruse. And he was given a task that he couldn't have dreamed up before this morning, but even those didn't affect Shinji's mood right now. Perhaps at some point they would return to the forefront of his mind. No, not perhaps - they most likely would, and it would plunge him into anxiety and worry again. But not now.  
当然，这一切附带着一些奇怪的条件，尽管他相当确定这可能是个骗局。而且他还被赋予了一项任务，这是他今早之前做梦也想不到的，但即便如此，这些都没有影响到真嗣此刻的心情。也许在某个时刻，这些问题会再次浮现在他的脑海中。不，不是也许——它们很可能会，届时又会让他陷入焦虑和担忧之中。但不是现在。

He wondered how much of what he'd assumed to be endless, contradictory rudeness from Asuka was actually just a misinterpretation on his part. All those strange, incomprehensible behaviors. In Misato's apartment, dancing and sleeping together. In that pool. In Shinji's hospital room. In the school nurse's office. In the kitchen. And in her room, last night.  
他不禁思考，自己之前认为明日香那无尽的、矛盾的粗鲁行为，有多少其实只是自己的误解。那些奇怪、难以理解的行为。在美里小姐的公寓里，一起跳舞和睡觉。在那泳池中。在真嗣的病房里。在学校护士的办公室。在厨房。还有昨晚，在她的房间里。

Shinji swallowed hard. The weight of what happened came crashing down on him like an avalanche. Asuka's bare skin, glistening in the moonlight. The warmth of her soft body, radiating through the thin fabric.  
真嗣艰难地咽了口唾沫。发生的一切如雪崩般压在他心头。明日香赤裸的肌肤，在月光下闪着光泽。她柔软身体的温暖，透过薄薄的布料传递过来。

And another realization came, albeit a bit late.  
另一个念头随之而来，虽然稍显迟缓。

Asuka _wanted_ it to happen. Wanted _him,_ in her bed, pressed against her. She could have easily kicked him out at any point, but she didn't. Instead, she pulled him closer.  
明日香希望这一切发生。希望他躺在她的床上，紧贴着她。她本可以轻易地将他赶出去，但她没有。相反，她将他拉得更近。

Shinji's pants bulged. The house was quiet and the only sound was the faint chirping of cicadas in the distance. As he lay there, another question occurred to him. He wondered if Asuka had any idea what her actions were provoking in him. It was almost ridiculous to think she didn't know, at least partially. She felt it herself last night, after all. But how much did she actually know?  
真嗣的裤子鼓了起来。屋内静悄悄的，唯一的声音是远处微弱的蝉鸣。他躺在那里，心中又冒出了一个问题。他不知道明日香是否意识到她的行为在他身上引发了什么。几乎荒谬地认为她至少部分不知情。毕竟，昨晚她自己也感受到了。但她究竟知道多少呢？

He wondered if she knew what he did when he thought about her this way, by himself in a quiet room.  
他不知道她是否知道，当他独自一人在安静的房间里这样想着她时，他会做些什么。

Would she like it? Or, maybe, just maybe, would she do the same thing? Thinking about him?  
她会喜欢吗？或者，也许，只是也许，她也会做同样的事情？想着他？

The idea was so exciting it instantly sent a shiver down his spine, but at the same time, it was one of the most ridiculous things that had crossed his mind in his entire life. Girls didn't have sex drives; it was a known fact. Basic biology. Common sense.  
这个想法如此激动人心，立刻让他脊背发凉，但与此同时，这也是他一生中想到的最荒谬的事情之一。众所周知，女孩没有性欲；这是基本的生物学常识。

But there was a voice inside his head, whispering softly. That Asuka was a foreigner, that her idea of common sense would be fundamentally different from his. Their numerous encounters had already proved it.  
但他的脑海中有一个声音，轻声细语。说 Asuka 是个外国人，她的常识观念与他根本不同。他们多次的相遇已经证明了这一点。

Then another voice shouted angrily. _Shinji Ikari, the moment something goes in your favor you assume and do stupid things, that's why nothing ever ends up good for you!_  
然后另一个声音愤怒地大喊。碇真嗣，一旦事情对你有利，你就自以为是，做出愚蠢的事情，这就是为什么你从未有过好结果！

Completely preoccupied with the voices in his mind, Shinji almost missed the real one coming from the kitchen.  
完全沉浸在脑海中的声音里，真嗣差点没注意到厨房传来的真实声音。

"Good. Do you know where Shinji is? Thought he was at home."  
“好。你知道真嗣在哪儿吗？还以为他在家呢。”

"Wark!" “Wark！”

Shinji jumped to his feet. "I-I'm here, Misato!"  
真嗣猛地站起身来。“我、我在这儿，美里！”

Only after he tripped over his own feet in his haste to leave his room, almost falling over on the way to the kitchen to face Misato and Penpen's startled eyes, did he realize that he overreacted. He could have just walked out slowly, but this just screamed getting caught in some act. He blushed and turned his gaze to Misato's red jacket hanging on the back of one of the chairs.  
直到他因为急匆匆离开房间而绊倒了自己的脚，差点在去厨房的路上摔倒，面对着 Misato 和 Penpen 惊愕的目光时，他才意识到自己反应过度了。他本可以慢慢走出去的，但这样子简直像是被抓了个现行。他脸红了，目光转向 Misato 挂在椅背上的红色夹克。

Misato lifted the hand that was stroking Penpen's head and started scratching her own instead. The beast took the opportunity to stick his snout into the bowl that was full of canned tuna.  
Misato 抬起正在抚摸 Penpen 头的手，开始挠自己的头。这只动物趁机把鼻子伸进了装满罐头金枪鱼的碗里。

"Hey, what's up? Is something wrong?" she asked.  
“嘿，怎么了？有什么不对劲吗？”她问道。

_I was about to decide whether or not to masturbate to Asuka,_ he couldn't say. "Oh, nothing..."  
我正要决定是否对着明日香自慰，他不能说。“哦，没什么……”

"Did Asuka go to school on time? She must be tired, now that I think of it. A whole lot of business happened recently."  
“明日香按时上学了吗？想想她一定很累。最近发生了好多事。”

_You're more right than you could ever imagine,_ Shinji muttered to himself. "Yeah, she's good. I saw her off to the station, actually."  
“你说得对得超乎想象，”真嗣自言自语道，“是啊，她很好。实际上，我还送她去了车站。”

Misato tilted her head slightly. Shinji blushed, feeling he disclosed too much. Thankfully she didn't probe further.  
美里微微侧头。真嗣脸红了，觉得自己透露得太多。幸好她没有继续追问。

"Okay. If it's three o'clock and I'm not up and ready for work, could you wake me up? I've set my alarm, but still."  
“好吧。如果三点了我还没起床准备上班，你能叫醒我吗？我已经设了闹钟，但还是。”

Shinji gave a curt nod, and watched Misato trudge to her room with a can of beer in her hand. He had no idea when she'd taken it out. Then he went back to his room.  
真嗣简短地点了点头，看着美里手里拿着一罐啤酒，拖着脚步走向她的房间。他完全不知道她是什么时候拿出来的。然后他回到自己的房间。

He sighed as he lay in the bed, staring at the ceiling like he did earlier. His thoughts returned to Asuka again, and with that he realized that he hadn't thought of much else these days, that it had been a while since the girl _hadn't_ been at the center of the whirlwind in his head. School, Eva, even his father had taken a back seat. A girl must be such a magical thing to a boy, he supposed. Everything else, everything that had ever seemed important, had been pushed to the periphery now, and in the midst of all those lost and confused feelings, one girl had swooped in and made her presence felt.  
他躺在床上，叹了口气，像之前那样盯着天花板。他的思绪再次回到了明日香身上，随之他意识到，这些天来他几乎没怎么想过其他事情，那个女孩已经很久没有离开过他脑海的中心了。学校、Eva，甚至他的父亲都退居次要。他猜想，对一个男孩来说，一个女孩必定是如此神奇的存在。其他一切，曾经看似重要的一切，现在都被推到了边缘，而在所有这些迷失和困惑的情感中，一个女孩闯了进来，让她的存在感变得强烈。

And that thought led to more questions.  
这个念头引发了一连串的问题。

Was she thinking about him too? Right now, at school? And if she was, did she think of him as often as he thought of her? Did she feel as confused as he did?  
她也在想他吗？此刻在学校？如果她也在想他，她是否像他想她那样频繁？她是否也感到和他一样的困惑？

The image of her, back when they first met, flashed before his eyes. Standing tall, looking down at him with a smile that was bordering on contemptuous.  
他们初次相遇时的她的模样，在他眼前一闪而过。她高高地站着，带着近乎轻蔑的微笑俯视着他。

Shinji narrowed his eyes, frustration filling his chest. Asuka, while being a naughty brat, was still much more mature than Shinji. Body and mind. There were times when she showed weakness, like when she'd come and laid next to him that night before fighting the Angel, but in general, she was stable and adjusted enough to make up for her rare slips. She always thought a few steps ahead, and her body was mature enough too. She was, really, a distant figure for a boy like Shinji. Out of his league, one might even say.  
真嗣眯起眼睛，心中充满了挫败感。尽管明日香是个调皮的小鬼，但在心智上，她远比真嗣成熟。无论是身体还是心灵。有时她会表现出脆弱，比如在对抗使徒的前一晚，她来到他身边躺下，但总的来说，她足够稳定和适应，能够弥补那些罕见的失误。她总是提前几步思考，她的身体也足够成熟。对于真嗣这样的男孩来说，她确实是一个遥不可及的存在。甚至可以说，她超出了他的能力范围。

There was no way she was confused. About anything.  
她不可能对任何事情感到困惑。

Shinji sighed again and closed his eyes. The day barely started and he was tired already.  
真嗣再次叹了口气，闭上了眼睛。这一天才刚开始，他就已经感到疲惫不堪了。

"So, Asuka, what do you think? What's the verdict?"  
“那么，明日香，你怎么看？结论是什么？”

She almost missed the question, distracted as she was by thoughts of a certain boy. She managed a shake of her head, as much a response as it was an attempt to clear her mind. Staring into the expectant eyes of the girl sitting in front of her, Asuka replied nonchalantly without even knowing what the topic was.  
她几乎错过了这个问题，满脑子都是某个男孩的身影。她勉强摇了摇头，这既是回答，也是试图清空思绪。凝视着坐在她面前女孩那期待的目光，明日香漫不经心地回答，甚至不知道话题是什么。

"I don't know. You'll have to tell me more."  
"我不知道。你得告诉我更多。"

As Asuka smiled proudly at her skillful dodge, the girl standing next to her - Kaori, or something along those lines - raised her hands in exasperation. "See, Maki. Asuka isn't interested in the trash like Taro, she's in a whole different league. She's basically saying he's not even worth commenting on. I bet she doesn't even know his face."  
当明日香得意地笑着，展示她巧妙的回避技巧时，站在她旁边的女孩——大概是叫香织之类的名字——无奈地举起双手。“看吧，真希。明日香对像太郎那样的废物没兴趣，她完全是另一个层次的。她基本上是在说他连被评论的资格都没有。我打赌她连他的脸都不认识。”

"I'm sure she saw him at least once, after that whole mess at Shuri Castle... oh, right, Asuka didn't go to Okinawa...I forgot." Maki, the girl who had asked Asuka the first question, scratched her head.  
"我敢说明日香至少见过他一次，在那次首里城的大混乱之后……哦，对了，明日香没去冲绳……我忘了。”最初向明日香提问的真希挠了挠头。

_Are you fucking with me or something?_ Asuka smirked."Yeah, I was a little busy that week."  
你他妈在逗我吗？明日香微微一笑。“是啊，那周我有点忙。”

Kaori clapped her hands. "Yeah, you guys fought an Angel while we were in Okinawa. Heard Ikari had a lot of trouble after that."  
香织拍了拍手。“没错，你们在冲绳的时候跟使徒打了一架。听说碇君那之后麻烦不少。”

_That was my first solo kill and he's the first one you mention._ Asuka felt offended, but didn't let it show. It was true that Shinji had been injured, and as a civilian without access to classified information it was natural that was all she could see. As Asuka calmed herself down with such thoughts, Maki leaned back on her chair and muttered.  
那是我第一次单独击杀使徒，而他却是你第一个提到的。明日香感到有些不快，但没有表现出来。确实，真嗣受了伤，作为一个没有接触机密信息的平民，她只能看到这些。明日香用这些想法平复自己的情绪时，真希靠在椅背上喃喃自语。

"Oh, right. I almost forgot too. I was sooo traumatized by yesterday's stuff I forgot everything that happened before that. Jeez, I wasn't even halfway through that ice cream pack I bought last week, had to throw the whole thing away."  
"哦，对了。我也差点忘了。昨天的事让我太受打击，之前的事都忘得一干二净了。天哪，我上周买的冰淇淋还没吃到一半呢，结果全扔了。"

Kaori covered her mouth, giggling. "A forced diet. Good for you."  
香织捂着嘴，咯咯笑道：“被迫节食。对你有好处。”

Maki snorted. "You say that like I'm the only one that gained a few kilos in Okinawa."  
真纪哼了一声。“说得好像只有我在冲绳胖了几斤似的。”

"Can't help it though, can we? Not like we're born with blessed genes like Asuka. Folks like her get to eat whatever they want and still stay slim. Normal people like us get fat if we eat too much."  
"可我们也没办法，不是吗？又不是像明日香那样天生带着被祝福的基因。像她那样的人，想吃什么就吃什么，身材照样苗条。我们这种普通人，吃多了就会发胖。"

Asuka, who had been listening silently, wrinkled her nose slightly. That was far from the truth. If anything, Asuka was blessed with a healthy, well-functioning body, which meant that what she ate was efficiently digested and absorbed. And those absorbed calories didn't go anywhere, they were either stored in her body or burned in activity. That was just the cold law of science. In fact, since she had left the strict control of the Berlin branch and started living here, she had gained a very worrying amount of weight, a bit over a kilogram on an empty stomach.

Naturally, Asuka's thoughts drifted once more to the culprit behind that weight gain. She wondered if the "blessed genes" Kaori mentioned were actually Shinji's, not hers. He didn't look like he was exercising regularly, and he ate almost the same things as Asuka. But somehow he was still so skinny. So unmanly.  
一直默默听着的明日香微微皱了皱鼻子。这离真相太远了。如果说有什么祝福的话，那就是明日香拥有一个健康且功能良好的身体，这意味着她吃下的食物能被高效地消化和吸收。而这些被吸收的卡路里并没有消失，它们要么储存在体内，要么在活动中被消耗掉。这只是科学的冷酷法则。事实上，自从她离开柏林分部的严格管控，开始在这里生活后，她的体重增加到了一个令人担忧的程度，空腹时超过了整整一公斤。

Maki shrugged and continued. "Anyway, what I was about to say is that barely anyone felt the presence of the Angel before the last one. Such a nonentity."  
Maki 耸了耸肩，继续说道：“总之，我要说的是，几乎没人能在最后一个天使出现前察觉到它的存在。真是毫无存在感。”

"Like Ikari?" whispered Kaori, lowering her voice.  
“像碇那样？”Kaori 低声细语，声音压得更低了。

As Asuka blinked at the unexpected turn, Kaori stifled a laugh, her shoulders heaving as if she had just thrown the funniest punchline in the history of humanity. Maki chuckled in amusement.  
当 Asuka 对这突如其来的转折眨眼时，Kaori 忍俊不禁，肩膀颤动，仿佛刚刚抛出了人类历史上最滑稽的笑点。Maki 也乐得笑了起来。

"He's a little creepy. You know, at first, since he looked good enough, and being a pilot, everyone couldn't shut up about him. Then look how it turned out. There's a reason he doesn't have any friends other than weirdos. Must be so tiring for Asuka, forced to get along with him."  
“他有点吓人。你知道的，一开始因为他长得不错，还是个飞行员，大家都对他赞不绝口。结果看看现在，他身边除了怪人就没别的朋友了。真不知道明日香是怎么忍受他的，肯定很累。”

It was only after the two girls' laughter had awkwardly died down that Asuka realized she hadn't been breathing. Maki blinked, perplexed, and said nothing. Kaori tried to catch Asuka's attention with an awkward smile. "He's still better than that Taro boy, right?"  
直到两个女孩的笑声尴尬地平息后，明日香才意识到自己一直没在呼吸。真希眨了眨眼，困惑地什么也没说。香织试图用一个尴尬的微笑吸引明日香的注意。“他总比那个太郎好吧？”

Maki nodded quickly. "Uh, yeah. I don't know what Yuko is thinking, going out with someone like that."  
真希迅速点头。“呃，对啊。我不知道由子是怎么想的，居然和那种人交往。”

Maki's eyes were on Asuka as she said that, so Asuka looked away and shrugged. She then snorted, wondering if this was the kind of gossip they'd been talking about earlier. "Well, yeah."  
真希的目光紧随着明日香，当她说出那句话时，明日香移开了视线，耸了耸肩。随后她轻哼一声，心想这会不会就是她们之前谈论的那种八卦。“嗯，是啊。”

Kaori chimed in again. "Yeah, that third grader I told you about is much better."  
佳织再次插话道：“是啊，我跟你提过的那个三年级生可强多了。”

Maki chuckled. "That again?"  
真希轻笑一声：“又提这个？”

"He's handsome, he's tall. Plenty of reasons to like him. Not sure why anyone wouldn't."  
"他英俊，他高大。喜欢他的理由多得很。真不明白怎么会有人不喜欢他。"

Asuka propped her elbow on the desk and set her chin on her hand. _Is it supposed to work like that?_ she thought. _Do you need a reason to like someone?_  
明日香将手肘撑在桌上，托着下巴。喜欢一个人需要理由吗？她暗自思忖。难道这事儿还有公式可循？

Did Shinji have a reason? Other than because she was pretty and available.  
真嗣喜欢她有理由吗？除了因为她漂亮又单身之外。

As Asuka frowned slightly, Maki looked back toward Kaori and shook her head in disbelief. "Nooo. He's a whore, big no no."  
明日香微微皱眉，真希回头看向香织，难以置信地摇了摇头。“不不不。他是个花花公子，绝对不行。”

Kaori giggled uneasily. "Watch your mouth. I don't want to get in trouble with Hikari because of you."  
香织不安地轻笑。“注意言辞。我可不想因为你就惹上光的问题。”

That made Asuka realize something she forgot the whole time, so distracted was she by the thoughts of one boy.  
这让明日香意识到自己一直忽略了某件事，满脑子都是那个男孩的身影。

"Oh, that's right, where's Hikari? The class is about to start and she's nowhere to be seen."  
"哦，对了，光在哪里？马上就要上课了，她却不见踪影。"

Kaori smiled shyly and covered her mouth with her hands. Asuka raised an eyebrow at the unexpected reaction. Maki smirked and leaned over.  
香织羞涩地笑了笑，用手遮住嘴巴。明日香对这突如其来的反应挑了挑眉。真希则咧嘴一笑，凑了过来。

"Asuka, did she say anything to you lately?"  
"明日香，她最近有没有对你说什么？"

_Say what?_ Before she could ask, the front door slid open, catching the three girls' attention. Hikari walked into the classroom, followed by Toji Suzuhara carrying a large cardboard box. Hikari blushed slightly as she made eye contact with Asuka, averting her gaze, and then pointed to a corner of the classroom.  
什么？她还没来得及问，前门就滑开了，吸引了三个女孩的注意。光走进教室，身后跟着铃原东治，手里提着一个大纸箱。光与明日香对视时微微脸红，移开目光，然后指向教室的一角。

"Go, pack them all." “去，把它们都打包。”

Suzuhara shuffled along, muttering something under his breath. Kaori giggled, making way for him. Asuka glanced in Hikari's direction, but she ignored her, her brow furrowed and eyes fixed on Suzuhara. Asuka followed Hikari's gaze to where Suzuhara was working, and realized that the desk Suzuhara was emptying into the box belonged to Kensuke Aida.  
铃原东治一边嘀咕着什么，一边蹒跚前行。香织轻笑出声，为他让路。明日香瞥向光的方向，但她没理会，眉头紧锁，目光紧盯着铃原。明日香顺着光的视线看去，发现铃原正在收拾的桌子属于真希波·真理·伊吹。

Before she had a chance to think about what that meant, the bell rang for the first period. Hikari urged Suzuhara to hurry up in a sharp voice, and Kaori and Maki quickly returned to their seats.  
还没等她细想这意味着什么，第一节课的铃声就响了。光以尖锐的语气催促铃原快点，而香织和真希也迅速回到了自己的座位。

When Misato entered the office, Ritsuko Akagi was tapping her keyboard, eyes fixed on the monitor. She didn't even look up, as if she didn't care that Misato just barged in without even asking permission. "What is it? You didn't call."  
当美里走进办公室时，赤城丽子正敲打着键盘，眼睛紧盯着显示器。她甚至没有抬头，仿佛并不在意美里未经允许就闯了进来。“什么事？你没叫我。”

Wrinkling her nose slightly at the strong odor of cigarettes that seemed to permeate the room, Misato walked up to the desk and plopped down in the chair across from Ritsuko. She glared as the doctor stopped typing and finally raised her gaze. This was not something Misato wanted to do right after dragging herself to HQ, but it wasn't like she had any other choice.  
对房间里弥漫的浓重烟味微微皱了皱鼻子，美里走到桌前，一屁股坐在丽子对面的椅子上。她瞪着医生停下打字，终于抬起了目光。这不是美里刚拖着疲惫的身体来到总部就想做的事，但她似乎别无选择。

"I called Shinji's school."  
“我给真嗣的学校打了电话。”

Ritsuko raised her eyebrow. "To ask if Dr. Ritsuko Akagi is available for visitors?"  
律子挑了挑眉。“询问赤木律子博士是否方便接待访客？”

Misato wasn't in the mood for jokes, so she didn't acknowledge Ritsuko's words. "Why are you overruling other people's decisions, and by what right?"  
美里没心情开玩笑，所以她没有回应律子的话。“你凭什么越俎代庖，又有什么权利这么做？”

As if she had anticipated this whole situation, Ritsuko's reply was fast. "Technically, neither of us has the authority to make disciplinary decisions for students. That's the job of the Tokyo-3 Municipal Education Committee. You haven't made any decisions, so I haven't overruled any, naturally."  
"仿佛早已预料到这一切，律子的回复迅速而明确。“严格来说，我们俩都没有对学生进行纪律处分的权力。那是东京-3 市教育委员会的职责。你并未做出任何决定，我自然也没有否决任何事情。”

Misato snorted. "Then let me be more precise: why did you take my 'advice' on pilot security and change it without consulting me?"  
"美里哼了一声。“那让我说得更准确些：你为何未经我同意就擅自更改了我关于驾驶员安全的‘建议’？”

How embarrassing that phone call was. "But, Captain, Aida's expulsion was reversed at Nerv's request," the headmaster had replied, confusion palpable even over the receiver. Bad enough that outsiders were meddling in their affairs, but the messages they received weren't even consistent.  
"那通电话真是令人尴尬。“但是，上校，在 NERV 的要求下，相田的开除决定被撤销了，”校长在电话那头回答，困惑之情即便隔着听筒也清晰可感。外人插手他们的事务已经够糟糕了，连收到的指示都前后不一。

Ritsuko's gaze returned to the monitor. "Because it wasn't necessary anymore."  
律子的目光回到了显示器上。“因为已经没有必要了。”

"Pilot security-" “驾驶员安全——”

It was Ritsuko who snorted this time. "I'm well aware that security concerns weren't necessarily the only reason you wanted to punish that boy so severely." Then a hand came up to stop Misato from retorting. "And you don't have to worry about that anyway. The boy in question will be completely removed."  
这次是律子哼了一声。“我很清楚，安全问题未必是你想那么严厉惩罚那男孩的唯一原因。”随后一只手抬起阻止了美里反驳。“总之你不用担心那个。那男孩将会被彻底排除。”

Misato narrowed her eyes. "What do you mean by that?"  
美里眯起了眼睛。“你这话是什么意思？”

"He's going to America soon. Would be hard to take pictures of Asuka while living in Nevada, right?"  
“他很快就要去美国了。住在内华达州的话，要拍明日香的照片可不容易吧？”

"What?" "什么？"

Keyboard sounds. "We're planning to transfer Mr. Hiroshi Aida from Section 3 to the Nevada branch. His resignation was turned down, but only on the condition that he would take that troublemaker with him. The clean solution, I'd say. No more trouble, no more headaches."  
键盘敲击声。“我们计划将第三部门的相田洋介先生调往内华达分部。他的辞职被拒绝了，但条件是他必须带上那个麻烦制造者。我认为这是个干净的解决方案。不再有麻烦，不再有头疼。”

Oh, she almost forgot. His father was an employee here. Still, Misato felt like something wasn't adding up in her head. "Why? You're being awfully more considerate than usual."  
哦，她差点忘了。他父亲是这里的员工。尽管如此，美里觉得脑海中有些事情不太对劲。“为什么？你今天格外体贴啊。”

"Why not?" Ritsuko shrugged nonchalantly. "I don't see any reason for you to care about this anymore. Aren't you busy enough without this?"  
“为什么不呢？”律子漫不经心地耸了耸肩。“我看不出你还有什么理由关心这件事。你不是已经够忙了吗？”

As soon as she heard that, Misato realized there was something more to this, that there was some other reason Ritsuko wasn't telling her. Regardless, she had to admit that she was busy enough. There were so many other things on her mind right now. From the simple matter of the still unfinished clean-up of the last battle, to the picture on her desk of Shinji and Asuka snapped by their security details this morning, the two pilots holding hands for the whole world to see. And of course, to the far more serious matter of Kaji. She couldn't afford to waste time on small matters.  
一听到这话，美里立刻意识到这其中另有隐情，律子还有些事情没告诉她。不过，她不得不承认自己确实很忙。现在她脑子里有太多事情要处理。从上次战斗后尚未完成的清理工作，到今早安全人员拍到的照片——真嗣和明日香手牵手，仿佛要让全世界都看见。当然，还有更严重的事情，关于加持。她没有时间浪费在小事上。

So, Misato just sighed and scratched her head. "Maybe."  
于是，美里只是叹了口气，挠了挠头。“也许吧。”

Ritsuko hummed. "Is there something else you need to ask me? Or something to say?"  
律子哼了一声。“你还有什么需要问我的吗？或者有什么要说的？”

There were quite a few somethings, actually.  
实际上，确实有不少事情。

The report on the infrastructure damage she asked for had been sent through email. She didn't understand half of it. Or perhaps the matter of the two pilots that lived together under her supervision. How those kids, faces still plump with baby fat, seemed to have started a relationship. Coupled with their not-so-optimal mental stability and the whole situation was a recipe for disaster. She'd known about it from the start and let it happen. She even thought it was funny when they were stealing her perfume and spending a weekend in the hospital together. But that picture of them together made her doubt the whole thing. The downcast look on Shinji's face and the fierce expression on Asuka's did not bode then again, Misato wasn't sure if it was the right topic to bring up here. It wasn't Ritsuko's business, at least not officially, and it didn't seem like something she would be personally interested in either. Or maybe she already knew everything and chose to not mention it.  
她索要的基础设施损坏报告已经通过电子邮件发送了。她对其中一半内容都摸不着头脑。又或许是那两位在她监管下同居的驾驶员的事情。那些孩子，脸颊上还带着婴儿肥，似乎已经开始了一段恋情。再加上他们并不十分稳定的心理状态，整个情况简直就是灾难的配方。她从一开始就知道这一切，并任其发展。甚至当他们偷用她的香水，一起在医院度过周末时，她还觉得挺有趣。但那张他们在一起的照片让她对整件事产生了怀疑。真嗣脸上沮丧的表情和明日香凶狠的神情，再次让美里不确定是否该在这里提起这个话题。这毕竟不是律子的职责范围，至少不是官方的，而且看起来也不像是她个人会感兴趣的事情。或者她已经知道了一切，只是选择不提及。

And another one, Kaji. The suspicion of Ritsuko knowing about it already and being silent applied here as well. She wasn't sure how to deal with him anyway, or even what was going on specifically. She didn't even know how to bring it up.  
还有另一个，加治。怀疑律子早已知情却保持沉默的情况也适用于此。她甚至不确定该如何面对他，更别提具体发生了什么。她连如何提起这件事都不知道。

One thought spawned another, and another, and another, and Misato frowned. Something ominous tickled the back of her mind. But she had no words to explain that feeling.  
一个念头引发另一个，再一个，又一个，美里皱起了眉头。某种不祥的预感在她的脑海中若隐若现。但她找不到任何词语来解释这种感觉。

Misato shook her head. "No. Nothing."  
美里摇了摇头。“不，没什么。”

---

Her cell phone vibrated. Asuka reflexively reached into her skirt pocket and pulled out the phone, stopping just short of flipping it open. The name "Third Child" was showing on the external screen.  
她的手机震动起来。明日香本能地伸手到裙袋里掏出手机，差点就要翻开盖子。外屏上显示着“第三适格者”的名字。

_Of course it's him._ Asuka groaned. The sunlight, which had turned orange at some point, heated up the bench she was sitting on. It had been a long time since she'd sent Hikari off, and long past the time she should have been home. It was only natural that he would try to contact her.  
当然是他。明日香叹了口气。不知何时已变成橙色的阳光，加热了她所坐的长椅。她送走光已经很久了，也早该回家了。他会试图联系她，这再自然不过了。

_Is he worried? Probably._ The thought made Asuka uncomfortable. Just a little. But she needed time. Time to clear her head a little and organize her thoughts.  
他在担心吗？大概吧。这个念头让明日香有些不自在。只是有点。但她需要时间。需要一点时间来理清思绪，整理心情。

And it worked, she did get some things sorted out.  
结果证明这招有效，她确实理清了一些事情。

First was the matter of Aida. It hadn't taken her that long to decide. The fact that the bastard's expulsion had been canceled, but he wasn't coming back to school, wasn't really a big deal to Asuka, and to be honest, she didn't want to think about him one way or the other ever again. Shinji might want to know about this, she supposed, but if that's the case he would have to find out on his own.  
首先是关于 Aida 的事。她没花多长时间就做出了决定。那个混蛋的退学被取消了，但他不会回学校，这对明日香来说并不算什么大事，老实说，她再也不想以任何方式考虑他了。她想，真嗣可能会想知道这件事，但如果真是这样，他得自己去发现。

And secondly, Asuka was now certain that Hikari had something on Suzuhara. The girls who had sniffed it out before she did had been gossiping about it nonstop both in front of and behind Hikari's back all morning, and it had gotten to the point where Asuka couldn't help but be interested. Hikari did try to deny the accusation at every opportunity, but so far it had only backfired, and when Asuka asked her about it on the walk home, when there was no one else but the two of them, she had practically admitted it. Asuka decided she would break the news to Shinji when she got home.  
其次，明日香现在确信光对铃原有所隐瞒。之前那些比她先嗅到风声的女生们一整天都在光面前和背后不停地八卦，以至于明日香忍不住产生了兴趣。光虽然每次都试图否认，但结果却适得其反，当明日香在放学回家的路上单独问她时，她几乎已经默认了。明日香决定回家后把这件事告诉真嗣。

So why wasn't she doing it now? Why was she sitting on a bench near the apartment, basking in the hot afternoon sun? It was, at this point, that her thoughts became disorganized and stuck.  
那么，她为何现在没有行动？为何她坐在公寓附近的长椅上，沐浴在炎热的午后阳光中？就在此时，她的思绪变得杂乱无章，停滞不前。

It was clear that seeing Hikari and listening to the girls' gossip had somehow affected her. But how specifically?  
显然，看到光以及听那些女孩的闲言碎语不知怎地影响到了她。但具体是怎样呢？

Was it the flood of gossip, attention, and presumptuous judgments that shook her? Well, with the class as loud and focused as it was today over Hikari approaching Suzuhara, Asuka could easily imagine what their reaction would be if word got out that the two Evangelion pilots were dating. Was she overwhelmed by the prospect?  
是因为那些如潮水般的八卦、关注和自以为是的评判让她动摇了吗？嗯，今天班上因为光接近铃原而如此喧闹和专注，明日香不难想象如果传出两位福音战士驾驶员在交往的消息，他们的反应会有多激烈。她是否被这种前景压得喘不过气来？

_Probably not,_ she thought. Being the center of attention was something sweet and addictive to Asuka. She was so used to it, it was almost mundane and normal at this point, but that didn't stop it from feeling fantastic, something that never got old. No way was she going to be bothered by attention and gossip.  
大概不会吧，她想。成为焦点对明日香来说是甜蜜且令人上瘾的。她早已习惯，几乎觉得这是平凡而正常的，但这并不妨碍它感觉美妙，永不厌倦。她绝不会因为关注和流言而烦恼。

Maybe it'd be different for Shinji. Maybe he would be genuinely terrified of such a prospect. Maybe that kind of attention would stress him out a lot. A small voice whispered that maybe she should be more considerate, but she silenced it without much trouble. _He'll get used to it,_ she thought. _No, he will_ have _to get used to it. If he wants to keep the honor of being an Evangelion pilot, he definitely should get used to being the center of attention._  
对真嗣来说可能不同。也许他会真的害怕这种前景。也许那种关注会让他压力山大。有个小小的声音提醒她应该更体贴些，但她轻易地压制了它。他会习惯的，她想。不，他必须习惯。如果他想保持作为 EVA 驾驶员的荣誉，他肯定应该习惯成为焦点。

Thinking about Shinji seemed to shake something loose in her mind. Asuka realized what was keeping her from returning home: something that was residing in the back of her mind, refusing to be confronted so far.  
想到真嗣似乎触动了她脑海中的某个开关。明日香意识到是什么阻止她回家：某种潜藏在心底的东西，一直拒绝面对。

Hikari was definitely the one to make the first move. All day long, Hikari was the only one fueling the raging gossip around her. Her blushes and stutters said everything her words did not. Suzuhara's reaction to everything, on the other hand, seemed more ambiguous. Whether he liked Hikari or not or even recognized her feelings for what they were was unclear. The passive and generally dumbfounded reaction that he had towards Hikari and the entire situation irritated Asuka.  
光无疑是主动出击的那一个。一整天下来，光是唯一一个在周围激起八卦热潮的人。她的脸红和结巴已经说明了一切，尽管她没有明说。另一方面，铃原对这一切的反应似乎更加模糊。他是否喜欢光，甚至是否意识到光对他的感情，都不得而知。他对光和整个情况的被动和通常是茫然的反应让明日香感到恼火。

Did he actually like Hikari? Or was he just going along with it because she was being proactive? And if he did like her, was it just because she was paying attention to him? Was there a real reason on his part, beyond just being attracted to breasts and ass?  
他真的喜欢光吗？还是只是因为她主动而随波逐流？如果他真的喜欢她，是不是仅仅因为她关注他？他那边是否有真正的理由，而不仅仅是因为被胸部和屁股吸引？

Those questions inevitably led to more uncomfortable and personal thoughts. Or maybe it was the presence of those uncomfortable thoughts that caused her to ask those questions in the first place. The exact order wasn't important anyway.  
这些问题不可避免地引发更多不舒服和个人化的思考。或者也许是那些不舒服的想法的存在促使她首先提出这些问题。无论如何，确切的顺序并不重要。

Asuka's life lately has been far more eventful than she ever expected. Even as a lifelong pilot, the terror of death and the excitement of combat were totally new to her. And on top of that, she got thrown into an unfamiliar culture, a barely-familiar language, and an unfamiliar place. To any normal person, this situation would be utterly overwhelming. But to the great Asuka Langley Soryu, this was nothing. Well, maybe not entirely nothing. Maybe she was feeling a little overwhelmed. A little unbalanced. And perhaps, in this excitable state of mind, she might have given in to her impulses without fully thinking things through. She might have acted recklessly, without really calculating what she was getting in return. Maybe she did expose her weakness in a brief,sweet moment of madness. Maybe she did prioritize her own wishes in the face of neutral evidence that could be interpreted either way. Maybe last night she was just exhausted, both in mind and body, and made the mistake of letting her guard down and her repressed longing get the best of her.  
最近，明日香的生活远比她预想的要精彩得多。即便作为一名终身飞行员，死亡的恐惧和战斗的刺激对她来说都是全新的体验。更别提，她还突然被抛入了一个陌生的文化、一种勉强熟悉的语言和一个陌生的地方。对普通人来说，这种情况绝对会让人感到彻底的压倒性。但对伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷来说，这根本不算什么。好吧，也许不完全是不算什么。也许她确实感到有些不知所措。有些失衡。而且，在这种兴奋的状态下，她可能没有完全深思熟虑就屈服于自己的冲动。她可能鲁莽行事，没有真正计算自己能得到什么回报。也许她确实在短暂的、甜蜜的疯狂时刻暴露了自己的弱点。也许她确实在面对可以两面解读的中性证据时，优先考虑了自己的愿望。也许昨晚她只是身心俱疲，犯了个错误，让她的警惕放松，压抑的渴望占了上风。

She remembered the feeling of his body pressed against hers. How warm he was. His hands, just that much bigger than hers, covering them.  
她记得他的身体紧贴着她的感觉。他是多么温暖。他的手，只比她的稍大一些，覆盖在她的手上。

Clicking her tongue, Asuka flipped open her phone. The text from 'Third Child' popped up on the screen. It was short, readable at a glance.  
阿斯卡咂了咂舌，翻开手机。屏幕上弹出了来自‘第三适格者’的短信。内容简短，一目了然。

_Asuka, you're a little late. Did something happen?  
明日香，你有点晚了。发生什么事了吗？_

Asuka frowned. She went back to the inbox and pressed the down button several times. And there it was. Before today, Shinji had never texted her. This one was the first since they'd exchanged numbers the day Asuka had transferred to the school.  
明日香皱起眉头。她回到收件箱，连续按了几下向下键。然后，她找到了。在今天之前，真嗣从未给她发过短信。这是自从明日香转学那天他们交换号码以来的第一条。

And in this short, seemingly unremarkable text, Asuka could sense vivid anxiety, which made her want to laugh. She could almost see and hear the stuttering, crawling voice and barely maintained gaze. He must be worried that it was his fault that she was later than usual.  
在这段简短而看似平凡的文字中，明日香能感受到明显的焦虑，这让她几乎要笑出声来。她几乎能看到那结巴、缓慢的声音和勉强维持的目光。他一定担心是她迟到是他的错。

And for once, he wouldn't be so wrong. Asuka snorted and folded her phone with a snap. Fidgeting around the questions was over. Now it was time to actually ask them. Maybe she wouldn't like the answers, but it was better than wallowing in self-doubt.  
而这一次，他倒也不算完全错。明日香哼了一声，啪地合上手机。绕着问题打转的日子结束了。现在是时候真正去问个清楚了。也许她不会喜欢那些答案，但总比沉溺于自我怀疑要好。

Shinji ended up masturbating. Of course, the deed was done after Misato left to work with a groan and the house was empty again, except for one penguin.  
真嗣最终还是自慰了。当然，这事是在美里叹着气出门工作，家里再次空无一人——除了那只企鹅——之后才做的。

Honestly, looking back at his record ever since he started doing it, he was doing it a lot less than he used to. The first few months here he was too tired and drained, both mentally and physically, to do anything of the sort. Additionally, he was usually hurt for at least a few days after every battle. His physical condition aside, the opportunity itself had become surprisingly rare. So he rationalized that it wasn't a bad idea to do it now, since neither Asuka nor Misato were around. But the usual guilt and self-loathing that came with the fact that he was using Asuka a lot these days, almost all the time to be honest, was hard to quell.  
说实在的，回顾他开始这么做以来的记录，他现在的频率远不如从前。初来乍到的几个月里，他身心俱疲，根本无力涉及此类事务。此外，每次战斗后他总要受伤几天。抛开身体状况不谈，连做这件事的机会本身也变得出奇地稀少。因此他合理化地认为，既然明日香和美里都不在，现在做并非坏主意。但近来他几乎无时无刻不在利用明日香，这种事实带来的惯常愧疚与自我厌恶感却难以平息。

After lying in bed for a while, battling self-doubt, Shinji got up, opened his textbook on the kitchen table, and tried to do some studying. He wasn't following the class that well even before the suspension, and with the recent turn of events the next test would probably be a nightmare if he didn't study now. But the attempt ended up being futile, just like it was when he tried the same thing this morning. The words just didn't register in his brain. In the languid afternoon air, Shinji sighed and closed the book, leaning back in the chair and staring up at the ceiling.  
在床上躺了一会儿，与自我怀疑斗争后，真嗣起身，打开厨房桌上的课本，试图学习一会儿。即便在停课之前，他也跟不上课程进度，而最近发生的事情让下一次考试可能会成为噩梦，如果他现在不学习的话。但这次尝试最终还是徒劳无功，就像他今早尝试的那样。那些文字就是无法进入他的大脑。在慵懒的午后空气中，真嗣叹了口气，合上书本，靠在椅背上，抬头凝视着天花板。

Right now, Shinji had more important homework to do. An assignment in a totally unfamiliar subject that he had no clue how to navigate.  
现在，真嗣有更重要的作业要做。一个完全陌生的科目，他完全不知道该如何着手。

It wasn't like he _hadn't_ made any progress, but he wasn't sure if the plan he'd come up with would appeal to Asuka. Dinner and a movie. Even to him that sounded so uninspired, so unoriginal. For all he knew she had done that a dozen times, if not more.  
并非他没有取得任何进展，但他不确定自己想出的计划能否吸引明日香。晚餐加电影。即使对他来说，这也听起来毫无新意，太过平凡。据他所知，她可能已经这样做过十几次，甚至更多。

The last thought was something that only just occurred to him, but it felt somehow natural, like he'd always known it. Asuka had probably been on many such dates. She was pretty, she was outgoing, and she was from the West, where things about dating were much more liberal than in Japan. She definitely had had boyfriends before.  
最后一个念头刚刚浮现，却感觉异常自然，仿佛他一直都知道。明日香很可能经历过许多这样的约会。她漂亮、外向，而且来自西方，那里的约会观念比日本开放得多。她肯定有过男朋友。

The thought made his stomach twist. Anger would be an odd way to describe it, but something definitely gripped him. He roughly snatched the SDAT off the table, plugged the earphones, hit play, and closed his eyes.  
这个想法让他的胃一阵翻腾。用愤怒来形容或许有些奇怪，但确实有什么东西紧紧抓住了他。他粗鲁地从桌上抓起 SDAT，插上耳机，按下播放键，然后闭上了眼睛。

The minutes ticked by, accompanied by the familiar tune of pop songs. When the clock struck four o'clock, track 26 ended. Shinji rose from his seat, now feeling a little calmer. It was almost time for Asuka to arrive.  
时间一分一秒地过去，伴随着熟悉的流行歌曲旋律。当钟声敲响四点，第 26 首曲子结束时，真嗣从座位上站了起来，现在感觉平静了一些。明日香差不多该到了。

Which she didn't. 她并没有。

At first he didn't think anything of it. A missed train or two, or a cleaning duty, was all it would take to be late like this.  
起初，他并未多想。错过一两班火车，或是打扫任务，都足以导致这样的迟到。

But when the clock hit 4:30, it became a little different. He checked the clock more and more frequently. Growing anxiety began to gnaw at Shinji's mind.  
但当时间指向 4:30 时，情况变得有些不同了。他越来越频繁地查看时钟。日益增长的焦虑开始啃噬真嗣的内心。

The events of last night and this morning now almost forgotten, Shinji's imagination began to run wild. He frowned. Maybe he should try actually contacting her instead of sitting here and making things up in his mind. Feeling like a fool, he picked up his cell phone from where it lay on the table.  
昨晚和今早的事件如今几乎被遗忘，真嗣的想象力开始肆意驰骋。他皱起眉头。也许他应该尝试真正联系她，而不是坐在这里凭空想象。感觉自己像个傻瓜，他从桌上拿起手机。

Looking down at his short inbox list, Shinji quickly realized that there was no previous text from Asuka for him to reply to; apparently they had never texted each other before. With a small groan he hit the back button a few times and opened the phonebook. The list wasn't that long, and the unusually long name immediately caught his eyes. It wasn't even fully displayed on the screen, leaving out the last part. _Asuka Langley So..._  
低头看着自己简短的收件箱列表，真嗣很快意识到没有来自明日香的短信让他回复；显然他们之前从未互发过短信。他小声咕哝着，按了几下返回键，打开了通讯录。列表并不长，那个异常长的名字立刻吸引了他的目光。屏幕上甚至没有完全显示出来，省略了最后一部分。明日香·兰格雷·索...

He froze again when he reached the message screen. What would be the least pathetic thing to write, he wondered. What could he say without giving away that this short wait was making him miserable?  
当他进入短信界面时，他又僵住了。他想知道，写什么才不会显得太可怜。他能说什么，而不让对方察觉到这短暂的等待让他如此痛苦？

The first excuse that came to mind was dinner preparation.  
脑海中浮现的第一个借口是准备晚餐。

_Asuka, I was thinking of frying tonkatsu for dinner, so I'm about to melt some. Is that okay? Or are you going to eat outside?  
明日香，我在考虑晚餐做炸猪排，所以正准备融化一些。这样可以吗？还是你打算在外面吃？_

Shinji was about to hit send when a last-minute suspicion struck him. Shinji had never asked for Asuka's opinion on this subject before, now that he thought about it. She was surprisingly generous when it came to food, never complaining or asking for something in particular, so Shinji had never felt the need to discuss this matter with her. It seemed odd to send a text like that now. Asuka was smart enough to see through it.  
真嗣正要按下发送键，最后一刻的疑虑突然袭来。仔细一想，他从未就此事征求过明日香的意见。她在食物方面出奇地大方，从不抱怨或特别要求什么，因此真嗣从未觉得有必要与她讨论这个问题。现在发这样的短信似乎有些奇怪。明日香聪明到足以看穿这一点。

Feeling so pathetic and annoyed by the situation, Shinji gritted his teeth, erased all of the text, and decided to shoot straight.  
感到如此可悲和恼火，真嗣咬紧牙关，删除了所有文字，决定直截了当地说。

_Asuka, you're a little late. Did something happen?  
明日香，你有点晚了。发生什么事了吗？_

He waited a moment, but no reply came. Shinji sat fidgeting nervously with his phone for a while, then decided he'd rather do something productive. Whatever that was.  
他等了一会儿，但没有回复。真嗣紧张地摆弄了一会儿手机，然后决定做点有建设性的事情。尽管他也不确定那是什么。

Cleaning was something that had to be done regularly, regardless of whether or not the inhabitants were being tidy. Even if everyone followed the basic principles, like returning things to their proper places after use, there would still be traces of life stacking up. However, that didn't mean that the tidiness of one's habits had no effect on the difficulty or the frequency required for cleaning. For Shinji it was a proven fact, complete with a control group.  
打扫是必须定期进行的事，无论居住者是否保持整洁。即便每个人都遵循基本原则，比如使用后将物品归位，生活中仍会留下痕迹。然而，这并不意味着个人习惯的整洁对清洁的难易程度或频率没有影响。对真嗣来说，这是一个经过对照组验证的事实。

For example, when he was living with his teacher, Shinji had never had to pick up hair by the handful from the sink and drain like he did now. And for the love of God, hair was everywhere. No matter how much he cleaned it up, it reappeared the next day. It wasn't this bad when it was just Misato, but since the red clumps started creeping in among the usual black mass, he started to seriously worry about them clogging up the drain if he forgot to fish them out once or twice. Now that he had returned to regular household duties after a period of sickness, Shinji had scraped a fistful of red hair off the floor and the bathtub drain. He smiled wearily, wondering how Asuka wasn't bald already, but the smile was quickly wiped away as he remembered what she said last night. With a sigh, he stepped out into the washroom area and tossed the lump of hair into a garbage bag, then removed the rubber gloves and hung them on a hanger in the corner. It wasn't much work, but his back still felt a little sore, so he put his hands on the small of his back and stretched.  
比如，当他与导师同住时，真嗣从未像现在这样，需要从水槽和下水道中一把一把地捡起头发。而且，天哪，头发无处不在。无论他清理多少次，第二天它们总会重新出现。之前只有美里在时还没这么糟糕，但自从那些红色发团开始混入寻常的黑色发堆中，他便开始认真担心，若有一两次忘记捞起它们，会不会堵塞下水道。如今病愈后回归日常家务，真嗣从地板和浴缸下水道刮下了一撮红色长发。他疲倦地笑了笑，好奇明日香怎么还没秃，但笑容随即因想起她昨晚的话而消失。叹了口气，他走进洗漱区，将那团头发扔进垃圾袋，然后摘下橡胶手套，挂在角落的挂钩上。工作量并不大，但他的背仍感到些许酸痛，于是他将手放在后腰，伸展了一下身体。

Anyway, the point was, when Shinji was living with his teacher he didn't have these struggles. His life was quiet back then, empty of the turbulence that was so frequent now. Simple and consistently predictable routines.  
无论如何，关键是，当真嗣与他的老师同住时，他没有这些挣扎。那时的日子很平静，没有如今这般频繁的动荡。简单且始终如一的日常。

Did he want to go back to that time? Maybe he did. He'd be lying if he said he wasn't somewhat drawn to the idea. A time without all the things that complicated his life now. A time when things were simple and easy. A time when his father was just a vague and distant memory. A time when he had never even heard of things like Evangelions or Angels. When he thought about it, he realized that _not_ wanting to go back to that time actually sounded insane.  
他是否想回到那个时光？或许是的。如果他说自己对此毫无向往，那是在撒谎。一个没有现在这些复杂事物的时代。一个简单轻松的时期。一个父亲只是模糊遥远记忆的时光。一个他从未听说过什么使徒或天使的时代。当他思考这一点时，他意识到不想回到那个时期听起来确实有些疯狂。

But that would not be the only thing that would be missing if he went back to his old life. If he hadn't come here, he wouldn't have made friends like Kensuke and Toji, for example.  
但如果他回到过去的生活，缺失的将不仅仅是这些。如果他没有来到这里，他就不会结交像真希波和东治这样的朋友。

And the thought made Shinji's heart sink. One of those two names was no longer a friend. A traitor. A name that should be forgotten, erased from memory. Frowning, Shinji forced his thoughts to other names, other faces.  
这个念头让真嗣的心沉了下去。那两个名字中，有一个已不再是朋友。一个叛徒。一个应该被遗忘，从记忆中抹去的名字。真嗣皱着眉，强迫自己想其他名字，其他面孔。

Ayanami. Looking cold, but in truth just as awkward with people as Shinji. He would be sad if he never saw her again.  
绫波。看起来冷漠，但实际上和真嗣一样不擅长与人相处。如果再也见不到她，他会感到难过。

Misato. Sometimes she genuinely frustrated him, making him wonder if things were really fine this way, but nonetheless she was the first adult who actually cared about Shinji. It had only recently occurred to him that maybe his teacher's nonchalant attitude wasn't actually normal behavior for a guardian.  
美里。有时她真的让他感到沮丧，让他怀疑事情是否真的这样就好，但她仍然是第一个真正关心真嗣的成年人。直到最近他才意识到，也许他老师的漫不经心并不是监护人的正常行为。

And of course, one certain redhead. A girl who burst into Shinji's life like a bomb, just when he thought he'd gotten used to the bizarre routine of monsters and robots, turning everything upside down. Aggressive, unruly, and loud, she shattered the tranquility of the house and painted it with her own colors. It was both ironic and symbolic that she literally took over Shinji's room as soon as she arrived here. In a way it wouldn't be so wrong to call her an intruder.  
当然，还有那个特定的红发女孩。就在真嗣以为自己已经习惯了怪物和机器人的奇异日常时，她像炸弹一样闯入了他的生活，将一切都颠覆了。她充满攻击性、不守规矩且大声喧哗，打破了房子的宁静，用自己的色彩重新粉刷了它。讽刺而又象征性的是，她一到这儿就占据了真嗣的房间。某种程度上，称她为入侵者并不为过。

But somehow, now that said intruder was nowhere to be seen, it was hard for Shinji to shake the feeling that something was missing. Even in the blistering heat of summer, he felt cold inside. Before her arrival, this had been routine and familiar, and now it was not. He wished she would come back soon to invade and shake up this uneasy peace.  
但不知为何，现在那个入侵者不见踪影，真嗣却难以摆脱一种缺失感。即使在炎炎夏日，他内心也感到寒冷。在她到来之前，这一切都是例行公事且熟悉的，现在却不再是了。他希望她能尽快回来，再次入侵并打破这不稳定的平静。

_And that's what she wants to do, too. No, she even wants to invade further into me,_ Shinji thought to himself, unbelievable as it was. He turned to the mirror. Freshly wiped and shiny, it reflected his face, paler and leaner than usual.  
她确实想这么做，不，她甚至想更深入地侵入我的内心，真嗣心想，尽管这听起来难以置信。他转向镜子。刚刚擦得干净发亮，镜子映出了他的脸，比平时更加苍白和消瘦。

_She likes me._ The thought was ridiculous, blasphemous almost.  
她喜欢我。这个想法荒谬至极，近乎亵渎。

_What does she even see in me?  
她到底看上我哪一点了？_

The sight of himself in the mirror was not a particularly inspiring one. He wasn't fat or anything, at least, but he wasn't exactly fit either. It wouldn't be a stretch to say he was scrawny, to be honest. He made a face and raised his fist, flexing his arm. A bicep did bulge out from beneath his shirt sleeve, but it was less of a bicep and more of a lack of fat. It wasn't developed like Toji's.  
镜中的自己并不特别令人鼓舞。他既不胖，也不算瘦，说实话，说他瘦弱也不为过。他做了个鬼脸，举起拳头，弯曲手臂。二头肌确实从衬衫袖子下鼓了出来，但与其说是二头肌，不如说是脂肪的缺失。它不像东二的那样发达。

_I must be taking after my mother,_ Shinji thought to himself, shoulders slumping. He had no memory of what she looked like, but he was almost sure of it. Father was tall and broad-shouldered, and if Shinji took after him he wouldn't be such a skinny, unimposing person.  
我一定是遗传了我母亲，真嗣暗自想着，肩膀耷拉下来。他对母亲的样貌毫无记忆，但几乎可以肯定这一点。父亲高大魁梧，如果真嗣像他，就不会如此瘦弱、不起眼了。

_So you want to look like Father._ He groaned. Yeah, maybe that was not the best idea.  
所以你想看起来像父亲。他叹息道。是啊，也许那不是个好主意。

As he was standing in front of the mirror like that, he heard the familiar sound of the wind blowing through the front door. His head snapped back to the half-open accordion door as a cheerful voice called out from the hallway. "I'm home."  
当他那样站在镜子前时，他听到了前门被风吹动的熟悉声响。他的头猛地转向半开的手风琴门，走廊里传来一个欢快的声音喊道：“我回来了。”

Shinji swallowed and left the bathroom, consciously slowing his steps down so as not to be in too much of a hurry. Asuka walked into the kitchen, her schoolbag slung over her shoulder, and stopped when she saw Shinji. He smiled, praying that it would look natural.  
真嗣咽了咽口水，离开了浴室，有意识地放慢脚步，以免显得过于匆忙。明日香背着书包走进厨房，看到真嗣时停了下来。他微笑着，祈祷这笑容看起来自然。

"You're late, Asuka. I texted you."  
“你迟到了，明日香。我给你发了短信。”

Asuka's eyes widened. "Really?" Her cell phone slipped out of her pocket and flipped open. She hummed thoughtfully. "I didn't know. I had some girl talk with Hikari after school."  
明日香的眼睛睁大了。“真的吗？”她的手机从口袋里滑落，翻开了。她若有所思地哼了一声。“我不知道。放学后我和光聊了会儿女生的话题。”

So that was it. As simple as that. Shinji almost deflated, feeling pathetic. Asuka just shrugged and started to move toward her room. Watching Asuka walk past him, not even looking in his direction once, Shinji wondered intensely if he should say anything now to continue the conversation or not. It would be weird if he asked what she and Hikari had been talking about. Maybe he could talk about dinner. His head was spinning, making him dizzy. He was annoyed at himself for dithering over such a simple matter. Meanwhile, Asuka had already entered her room. Like a moth to a lamp, he took a step toward the door of her room without thinking. As soon as he stopped in front of it, he heard Asuka's voice from inside. "Come in, don't just stand there like an idiot."  
原来如此。就这么简单。真嗣几乎要泄气了，觉得自己真没用。明日香只是耸了耸肩，开始朝她的房间走去。看着明日香从他身边走过，一眼都没看他，真嗣强烈地怀疑自己是否应该说些什么来继续对话。如果他问她和光在谈什么，会显得很奇怪。也许他可以聊聊晚餐。他的思绪乱作一团，让他感到头晕。他对自己在这种小事上犹豫不决感到恼火。与此同时，明日香已经进了房间。像飞蛾扑火一般，他不假思索地向她的房门迈了一步。刚站在门前，就听到明日香从里面传来的声音：“进来吧，别像个傻子一样站在那儿。”

Shinji's heart sank. He wondered if she'd heard footsteps, but that sounded unlikely. Asuka and Misato were the ones who left a thumping sound whenever they moved in the house, not Shinji. He was a polite, model Japanese who had learned to move without making a sound. It was unlikely she heard his footsteps - more like she had predicted his move from the start. Shinji opened the door, then stopped dead in his tracks before he even crossed the threshold.  
真嗣的心沉了下去。他猜想她是否听到了脚步声，但那听起来不太可能。明日香和美里才是那种在屋子里走动时会发出砰砰声的人，而不是真嗣。他是个礼貌、模范的日本人，学会了悄无声息地移动。她不太可能听到他的脚步声——更像是她从一开始就预料到了他的行动。真嗣打开门，却在跨过门槛之前僵住了。

Asuka was in the middle of changing clothes, her skirt and blouse puddled on the floor around her feet.  
明日香正在换衣服，她的裙子和衬衫堆在她脚边的地板上。

Of course, it wasn't like she was naked or anything; she was already wearing shorts, and she was just tucking her arms into a T-shirt. In fact, all he could see was the bottom half of her bra and her stomach underneath, which, in retrospect, wasn't much more than what he'd seen in the pool before, or even last night. Still, it was enough to paralyze him.  
当然，她并没有一丝不挂；她已经穿上了短裤，只是正在把胳膊伸进 T 恤里。实际上，他只能看到她胸罩的下半部分和下面的肚子，回想起来，这并不比之前在泳池里看到的，甚至是昨晚看到的更多。尽管如此，这已经足以让他动弹不得。

So alluring. So mature, almost adult. He couldn't believe she was the same age as the kid he'd seen in the mirror earlier.  
如此诱人。如此成熟，几乎像个成年人。他无法相信她和他在镜子中看到的那个孩子同龄。

And now that was his. Shinji felt his stomach churn at the thought. At first, with soaring excitement, then guilt. He felt disgusted at himself for thinking of Asuka as an object. And then helplessness, as if the strength was draining out of his legs. He had no right to have her; he knew it better than anyone, and when the inevitable moment came when Asuka realized it too, the suffering would be unbearable for him.  
而现在，她是他的了。这个念头让真嗣感到胃里一阵翻腾。起初是兴奋得飘飘然，随后是内疚。他对自己将明日香视为物品的想法感到厌恶。接着是无助，仿佛双腿的力量正在流失。他没有权利拥有她；他比任何人都清楚这一点，而当明日香不可避免地意识到这一点时，他将无法承受那份痛苦。

"Ogling much?" “看得很入迷嘛？”

Asuka's soft voice, tinged with mockery, brought him out of his thoughts. Asuka was now turned to him, looking him right in his eyes, and slipped her hands into the neck hole of her shirt, pulling out a hair that was trapped inside of it. Beneath the fluttering strands of red hair he saw her armpits, adding heat to his face. Shinji reflexively started to look away, but stopped halfway. One of the thoughts he'd had this morning, while listening to Misato's snoring echo through the house, came back to him.  
明日香那带着几分嘲弄的柔和声音将他从思绪中拉回。明日香此刻正转向他，直视着他的眼睛，双手伸进衬衫领口，拽出了一根缠在里面的头发。在飘动的红发下，他瞥见了她的腋下，这让他的脸颊愈发滚烫。真嗣本能地想要移开视线，却在半途停住了。今早听着美里鼾声在屋内回荡时，他曾有过的一个念头再次浮现。

Over the past few weeks Asuka had tried to get Shinji's attention in exactly the same way she was doing now, and each time, he had shied away. And each time, she had been disappointed in him. At the time, he hadn't understood Asuka's foul reactions and just thought her to be a very difficult person, but after this morning, the puzzle had come together. If you thought about it, there was nothing wrong with being attracted to someone you liked and expressing it through actions, and if they were going to be in a relationship now, it was only right that Shinji stared more shamelessly at her at times like this. It would be what Asuka expected from him.  
过去几周里，明日香一直试图以同样的方式吸引真嗣的注意，就像现在这样，而每一次，他都避开了。每一次，她都对他感到失望。那时，他并不理解明日香恶劣的反应，只觉得她是个很难相处的人，但今早之后，一切谜团都解开了。仔细想想，对喜欢的人产生吸引并透过行动表达，并没有什么不对，如果他们现在要开始一段关系，真嗣在这样的时候更无耻地盯着她看，也是理所当然的。这正是明日香所期待的。

So Shinji swallowed hard, steeled himself, and decided to show Asuka his first change as a boyfriend. He opened his mouth, feeling almost compelled by the way her eyes were intently watching him, demanding an answer. "I can't help it. I like what I'm seeing."  
于是真嗣硬着头皮，鼓起勇气，决定向明日香展示他作为男友的第一个改变。他张开嘴，几乎是被她专注凝视的眼神所驱使，要求一个回答。“我控制不住。我喜欢我所看到的。”

Shinji had never been one for optimism, never expecting the best from anything. But Asuka's reaction to his best attempt fell far short of even his abysmal expectations. She turned her head slightly away, narrowing her eyes. Shinji's heart froze at the sight.  
真嗣从未是个乐观主义者，从不期待任何事物最好的结果。但明日香对他最努力尝试的反应，甚至远低于他那糟糕透顶的预期。她微微侧过头，眯起眼睛。看到这一幕，真嗣的心都凉了。

_You were disappointed when I averted my eyes when you talked about thermal expansion and your breasts. You hated it when you came to visit me in the hospital and I ignored all those small touches and glances you gave me. So why, this time, did you purposely call me over to show me your skin and not like it when I can't take my eyes off you? Why has the equation been reversed, and for what reason? How am I supposed to keep up with this?_ Questions swirled in Shinji's head, frustration bordering on anger.  
当我谈到热膨胀和你的胸部时，我避开了视线，你感到失望。你讨厌来医院看我时，我忽视了你那些小小的触碰和眼神。那么这次，你为什么故意叫我来展示你的肌肤，却不希望我无法移开视线呢？为什么方程式被颠倒了，出于什么原因？我该如何跟上这一切？问题在真嗣的脑海中盘旋，沮丧近乎愤怒。

Shinji started to apologize, as he always did when faced with something he couldn't handle, but at that moment, the air around Asuka changed again, abruptly. The momentary distress vanished like a lie, and a smile appeared on her face. She ran a light hand through her hair as Shinji rubbed his eyes, wondering if he was losing his mind. "Shinji, did you know that Hikari likes Suzuhara?"  
面对无法应对的情况，真嗣总是习惯性地开始道歉，但就在那一刻，围绕着明日香周围的空气再次突变。那一瞬间的困扰如同谎言般消失，她的脸上绽放出笑容。她轻轻地拨弄着头发，而真嗣揉着眼睛，怀疑自己是否快要疯了。“真嗣，你知道光喜欢铃原吗？”

Maybe I did lose my mind, Shinji thought. "Uh, what?"  
也许我真的疯了，真嗣心想。“呃，什么？”

Asuka slouched a little bit and giggled. It was so innocent and sweet that Shinji also reflexively smiled, blushing slightly. He didn't even know the context; for all he knew he might have been the butt of the joke. But at this moment it didn't matter. Her laughter made him smile. This girl had such power over his emotions.  
明日香稍微放松了些，咯咯地笑了起来。那份纯真和甜美让真嗣也不由自主地微笑，脸上微微泛红。他甚至不知道背景是什么；他可能完全就是个笑话的对象。但此刻这都不重要了。她的笑声让他也笑了。这个女孩对他的情绪有着如此强大的影响力。

"She's been trying to talk to him all day today, using every excuse she could think of. Well, some of them were plausible, I'll give her that. There was a group activity in Japanese class - groups of two, precisely. And Hikari just walked up to him and grabbed him. Saying since he had no one to pair up with, it was Class Rep's duty to care for the leftovers or something. Anyone would have been fooled if she hadn't blushed so brightly."  
"她今天一整天都在找机会和他说话，用尽了她能想到的各种借口。好吧，有些确实说得过去，这点我得承认。日语课上有小组活动——正好两人一组。而光就那么径直走到他面前，一把拉住了他。说什么既然他没人搭档，作为班长的职责就是照顾落单的人之类的。如果不是她脸红得那么明显，谁都会被她骗过去的。"

Regardless of the absurdity, Shinji could vividly picture it, right down to Toji's bemused reactions. He lifted a hand to scratch the back of his head. "Whoa."  
尽管这番举动有些荒唐，真嗣却能清晰地想象出那场景，甚至连东治那困惑的反应都历历在目。他抬起手挠了挠后脑勺，感叹道："哇哦。"

"You're close with Suzuhara. What do you think? Does he have feelings for Hikari too?"  
"你和铃原关系不错。你怎么看？他是不是也对光有意思？"

It made him speechless. The smile that lingered on Asuka's lips didn't reach her eyes. She was serious again. Shinji was perceptive enough to recognize that. In fact, reading the moods of the people he was dealing with was one of the things he was really good at. He just sucked at deducing the reasons behind those moods. In this case, though, it occurred to him that Asuka might dislike Toji very, very much, and that she might feel bad about her friend getting involved with him. Maybe that's why she was in such a bad mood. Shinji had to resist the urge to sigh. "Well, I don't know. I guess there's no reason not to, though..."  
这让他无言以对。明日香嘴角挂着的微笑并未触及她的眼底。她又变得严肃起来。真嗣足够敏锐，能察觉到这一点。事实上，读懂与他打交道的人的情绪是他擅长的领域之一。只是他不擅长推断这些情绪背后的原因。不过，这次他意识到明日香可能非常、非常不喜欢冬二，而且她可能对她的朋友卷入与他的关系感到不快。也许这就是她心情不好的原因。真嗣不得不忍住叹息的冲动。“嗯，我不知道。我想没有理由不这么做，虽然……”

Asuka snorted. "Right. You boys are thirsty. Whoever comes to them first is enough, I guess."  
明日香哼了一声。“没错。你们这些男生就是饥渴。谁先找上门来就够了，我想。”

Shinji realized he'd stepped into a minefield, and while he still didn't know why or where this was going, the threat itself was palpable. The next moment Asuka confirmed his doubt as she stopped and looked at him.  
真嗣意识到自己踏入了雷区，尽管他仍不明白原因或这会走向何方，但威胁本身是显而易见的。下一刻，明日香停下脚步，看着他，证实了他的疑虑。

"Shinji." “真嗣。”

Shuddering before those piercing blue eyes, Shinji resisted the urge to swallow. "Uh, yeah."  
在那些锐利的蓝眼睛前颤抖，真嗣忍住了吞咽的冲动。“呃，是的。”

"I need to ask you a question, and I need you to be honest."  
“我需要问你一个问题，而且我需要你诚实回答。”

Overwhelmed, Shinji didn't even dare to respond, just nodded. Asuka's eyes narrowed and her lashes fluttered. The realization that even her eyelashes were red crossed his mind, and Shinji wanted to slap himself silly for thinking about such things in such a serious situation. There was a moment of silence, and the distant cicadas were drowned out by the pounding of his heart against his eardrums. The air became tense,then relaxed again. As did the expression on Asuka's face. For a fleeting moment, she looked almost sad, but even that faded without a trace. Shinji was relieved by the de-escalation, but soon felt irritated; he didn't even know what he'd done wrong to deserve to be squeezed like a mouse in front of a cat by this girl. He wondered if this was something he had to put up with forever if they were to date.  
被压倒性的气氛笼罩，真嗣甚至不敢回应，只是点了点头。明日香的眼睛眯了起来，她的睫毛轻轻颤动。他意识到连她的睫毛都是红色的，真嗣想扇自己一巴掌，居然在这种严肃时刻想这些。一阵沉默，远处的蝉鸣被他耳膜上心跳的轰鸣淹没。空气变得紧张，然后又放松了。明日香的表情也是如此。有那么一瞬，她看起来几乎有些悲伤，但那表情也转瞬即逝。真嗣因紧张的缓解而松了口气，但很快又感到烦躁；他甚至不知道自己做了什么错事，要在这个女孩面前像老鼠面对猫一样被挤压。他不知道如果他们要交往，这是否是他必须永远忍受的事情。

Asuka spoke up flatly, probably not knowing what he was thinking. "Date plan. You got anything in mind?"  
"明日香平淡地开口，大概并不知道他在想什么。“约会计划。你有什么想法吗？””

"Ah." It was an unexpected question, and Shinji felt really stupid for it, because he should have seen it coming. But he was at least prepared for it. "Uh, yeah. Asuka, are you free this Saturday evening?"  
"“啊。”这是个出乎意料的问题，真嗣觉得自己为此显得很蠢，因为他本该预见到这一点。但至少他对此有所准备。“呃，是的。明日香，你这周六晚上有空吗？””

The corner of Asuka's mouth lifted. "Maybe? Maybe not."  
"明日香嘴角微微上扬。“也许？也许不。””

Shinji didn't like her answer, but he didn't show it. Trying to reassure himself that she was just joking, that she would make herself available for him that day, he managed a smile "So, uh, how about dinner and a movie? Does that sound good?"  
真嗣并不喜欢她的回答，但他没有表现出来。他试图安慰自己，她只是在开玩笑，那天她会为他腾出时间，他勉强笑了笑：“那么，呃，晚餐和电影怎么样？听起来不错吧？”

"What movie? Is there a recent release? Where are we going to eat? Are we going to eat first or watch the movie first? What are you going to tell Misato?"  
“什么电影？最近有新片上映吗？我们去哪儿吃？是先吃饭还是先看电影？你要怎么跟美里说？”

The pressure Shinji was feeling was of course nothing compared to being pinned down in battle, but it was steadily approaching that level. "Well, I'll need more time to figure those things out..."  
真嗣感受到的压力当然无法与战斗中被压制相比，但这种压力正在稳步接近那个水平。“嗯，我需要更多时间来弄清楚这些事情……”

Asuka sighed and shook her head, and that sight made Shinji lose every shred of self-esteem he had left. She picked up her schoolbag from the floor, and tossed it roughly on her desk, then turned back to Shinji who was still standing in the doorway. "Can you even eat anything? Aren't you supposed to only eat congee?"  
明日香叹了口气，摇了摇头，这一幕让真嗣失去了仅存的一丝自尊。她从地上捡起书包，粗鲁地扔到桌上，然后转身面对仍站在门口的真嗣。“你能吃东西吗？不是应该只喝粥吗？”

Shinji scratched the back of his head. "I think I'll be fine by then. I mean, I definitely feel better than last week. I was going to try a normal diet tonight, actually."  
真嗣挠了挠后脑勺。“我想那时候应该没问题了。我是说，我肯定感觉比上周好多了。其实今晚我打算尝试正常饮食。”

Asuka threw up her hands. "Good. I'm starving. Make something quickly."  
明日香双手一摊。“好。我饿死了。快做点什么。”

So this is the end. With a bitter feeling, Shinji nodded. He turned toward the kitchen and saw Penpen standing at the end of the hallway, staring at him. The penguin opened his beak slightly as he made eye contact with Shinji. He wondered what that meant. Shinji wondered if he understood the conversation between himself and Asuka. Then he heard Asuka clearing her throat. He frowned slightly and turned back to her room again. Asuka was facing the window, her back to him. Her hair blurred into the glow of the setting sun, and Shinji stared at it for a moment, mesmerized.  
原来这就是结局。带着苦涩的心情，真嗣点了点头。他转向厨房，看到 Penpen 站在走廊尽头，盯着他。企鹅微微张开嘴，与他目光相接。他不知道这代表着什么。真嗣想知道 Penpen 是否理解了自己和明日香之间的对话。随后，他听到明日香清了清嗓子。他微微皱眉，再次转向她的房间。明日香背对着窗户，背对着他。她的头发在夕阳的余晖中模糊不清，真嗣凝视了一会儿，为之着迷。

"Shinji." “真嗣。”

She sounded strangely serious. Shinji opened his mouth, slightly nervous. "Huh?"  
她的语气异常严肃。真嗣微微张开嘴，有些紧张。"嗯？"

"I feel that again. Do something."  
“我又感觉到了。做点什么。”

Feel what? He almost asked back but swallowed the question at the last second. Yesterday's events came back to him. Then, what he had to do was...  
感觉什么？他几乎脱口反问，却在最后一刻咽下了这个问题。昨天的事件再次浮现脑海。那么，他必须做的事情是……

Stifling a pounding heart, Shinji took a heavy step toward Asuka, then carefully opened his arms and wrapped them around her shoulders, careful to not touch her in the wrong places. At the last moment, Asuka leaned in, making it a full embrace. The warmth of their bodies mingled, and he smelled the scent of afternoon sweat from her, almost masked by the fragrance of new clothes and the overwhelming strawberry of shampoo. His lower stomach tightened and his heart pounded in his chest.  
压抑着狂跳的心，真嗣沉重地向明日香迈出一步，然后小心翼翼地张开双臂，环绕在她的肩上，小心避免触碰到不妥之处。在最后一刻，明日香倾身向前，使这变成了一个完整的拥抱。两人的体温交融，他闻到了她身上午后汗水的气息，几乎被新衣的香气和浓烈的草莓洗发水所掩盖。他的下腹紧绷，心脏在胸腔中剧烈跳动。

She was probably lying about her phantom pain, at least this time. Shinji might be gullible, but he wasn't gullible enough to be fooled by this. But he didn't want to complain. He wanted to do more than just hug her. He wanted to kiss the nape of her neck, just a finger's length away from his lips. He wanted to grab her shoulders and turn her around to do...many things. He wanted to whisper in her ear that he was really doing his best, that he wanted her to trust him a little, that he wanted her to give him a chance for once.  
她这次很可能是在撒谎，至少关于她的幻痛是如此。真嗣或许容易相信人，但他还没天真到会被这种谎言所欺骗。但他并不想抱怨。他想要的不仅仅是拥抱她。他想亲吻她的后颈，那距离他的唇仅一指之遥。他想抓住她的肩膀，让她转身，去做……许多事情。他想在她耳边低语，告诉她他真的在尽力，希望她能稍微信任他，希望她能给他一次机会。

But he couldn't bring himself to do it. Today, Asuka's reaction to his one-time bravery had crushed his desire to challenge himself in any form. It would take time for him to recover.  
但他无法让自己这么做。今天，明日香对他一时勇气的反应，彻底粉碎了他任何形式自我挑战的欲望。他需要时间来恢复。

_It would be nice if you were honest with me about what you want,_ Shinji thought, the fact that he himself wasn't being honest with her completely forgotten like a vague whisper in the back of his mind.  
如果你能对我坦白你想要什么就好了，真嗣心想，完全忘记了其实他自己也没有对她坦诚，这个念头就像脑海深处模糊的低语一样被遗忘了。

Asuka's shoulders stiffened slightly. So when she spoke, Shinji wasn't surprised. "Shinji."  
明日香的肩膀微微僵硬。所以当她开口时，真嗣并不感到意外。"真嗣。"

"Yeah?" “嗯？”

Shinji's breath tickled Asuka's neck, making her shudder slightly.  
真嗣的呼吸轻拂过明日香的脖颈，让她微微颤抖。

"I'll look forward to it. Saturday."  
“我很期待，周六见。”

Shinji didn't dare answer, just giving her a little squeeze with the arm around her. Soon, the stiffness was gone from her shoulders.  
真嗣不敢回答，只是用环绕在她腰间的手臂轻轻搂紧了她。很快，她肩膀的僵硬感便消失了。

As the silent embrace lengthened, all of Shinji's anxieties, frustrations, and fears were soothed. They weren't gone, but they were toned down to a point where he could relax, if only for a moment. Calmed.  
随着沉默的拥抱延长，真嗣的所有焦虑、挫折和恐惧都得到了抚慰。它们并未消失，但已被调和至一个他能暂时放松的程度。平静了。

_Maybe this should be good enough,_ Shinji thought. Even if he couldn't say everything to her, this was nice enough. He only hoped Asuka felt the same.  
也许这就足够了，真嗣心想。即使他无法向她倾诉一切，这样的时光也足够美好。他只希望明日香也有同样的感觉。

### Chapter 11 Branding

The next few days flew by.  
接下来的几天飞逝而过。

Asuka's routine itself had not fundamentally changed. Wake up, eat, go to school, classes, come home, eat, sleep, repeat. Shinji wasn't back at school yet, but it wasn't like she interacted much with him there to begin with. The only change she felt was the walk to and from school becoming a little lonelier. Of course, she would never admit that out loud.  
明日香的生活规律本身并没有根本性的改变。醒来，吃饭，上学，上课，回家，吃饭，睡觉，重复。真嗣还没回学校，但她在学校里本来就和他没什么互动。她唯一感觉到的是上学和放学的路上变得有点孤单。当然，她永远不会大声承认这一点。

The phantom pain never came back. Once, she used it as an excuse for Shinji to hug her again, but only once. Asuka had refrained from further abusing it, fearing he would eventually see through her lies. Shinji had visibly recovered too, much to Asuka's relief. Things were getting back to normal.  
那虚幻的疼痛再也没有回来。有一次，她用它作为借口让真嗣再次拥抱她，但只有一次。明日香克制自己不再滥用这个借口，担心他最终会识破她的谎言。真嗣也明显恢复了，这让明日香松了一口气。一切都在恢复正常。

As usual, Shinji packed her lunch. Asuka, from time to time, thought about thanking him, or even helping him out again, but she couldn't bring herself to say those things, at least without good excuses.  
像往常一样，真嗣为她准备了午餐。有时，明日香会想着感谢他，甚至再次帮他一把，但她就是说不出口，至少在没有好借口的情况下做不到。

School didn't change much either. Not a single thing about Kensuke Aida, or even Shinji, was ever mentioned again. Whenever the memory of the incident surfaced from the depths of her mind, Asuka felt disgusted and wondered how something like that with so many victims could be so easily buried. From the way everyone acted, it was as if nothing had ever happened and she was just crazy. Funnily enough, it was Shinji's absence that served as the starkest reminder that she didn't dream the whole thing up.  
学校也没什么变化。关于铃原 Kensuke 或真嗣的任何事情，再也没有人提起过。每当那次事件的记忆从她脑海深处浮现时，明日香感到厌恶，不明白为什么那么多受害者的事情能被如此轻易地掩盖。从大家的反应来看，仿佛什么都没发生过，她只是疯了。讽刺的是，真嗣的缺席成了最明显的提醒，让她知道这一切并非梦境。

Of course, that didn't mean nothing had changed. Quite the opposite, actually.  
当然，这并不意味着什么都没变。实际上，变化相当大。

At school, the entire class, including Asuka, watched Hikari and Suzuhara's every move with great interest. Asuka was almost awed by the way Hikari managed to get closer to achieving her goal every time, even beneath the pressure of everyone's gaze and with a blush on her cheeks. And all of Hikari's daily accomplishments were relayed to Shinji that same evening.  
在学校，全班同学，包括明日香，都饶有兴致地观察着光和铃原的每一个动作。明日香几乎被光每次都能在众人目光和脸颊绯红的压力下更接近目标的方式所折服。而光每天的这些成就，当晚都会传到真嗣那里。

They talked in the evenings now. It was Asuka's decision, consciously executed.  
他们现在晚上会聊天。这是明日香有意做出的决定。

"That lazy good-for-nothing is eating Hikari's food for lunch now! Unbelievable, I say!"  
那个懒惰无用的家伙现在居然在吃光的午餐！真是难以置信！

"Woah," said Shinji over the bowl of ochazuke, that night's dinner.  
“哇哦，”当晚晚餐时，真嗣对着那碗茶泡饭说道。

"_'Can you deal with the leftovers, Suzuhara?'_ What an excuse. Who would possibly believe that? She makes him food because she likes him, you gotta be inhumanly stupid to not see that."  
“‘你能处理剩菜吗，铃原？’这借口真烂。谁会信啊？她给他做饭是因为喜欢他，你得蠢到没人性才看不出来。”

"Sure." "当然。"

With that, Shinji smiled awkwardly and resumed eating. Asuka didn't like his simple, short reaction, but let it slide. Their conversations almost always went like this. Asuka would tell him about her day, and sometimes ask about his, while he returned the shortest and simplest answers possible.  
说完，真嗣尴尬地笑了笑，继续吃饭。明日香不喜欢他简单又简短的反应，但还是放过了他。他们的对话几乎总是这样。明日香会告诉他她的一天，有时也会问他的，而他则尽可能地用最短最简单的回答回应。

It was also Asuka's job to check if Shinji had researched the location of their date. Downtown, about a half-hour ride away by train. Just some ordinary family restaurant. A theater Shinji had been to once.  
这也是明日香的工作，检查碇真嗣是否研究过他们约会的地点。在市中心，乘火车大约半小时的路程。只是一家普通的家庭餐厅。一个碇真嗣曾去过一次的电影院。

"You've been there before?" she asked, and Shinji nodded enthusiastically.  
“你去过那里吗？”她问道，碇真嗣热情地点头。

"With who? Misato?" Asuka asked. Or maybe it was with another girl, the First or something. When Shinji froze and averted his gaze, anger flashed through her, its intensity surprising even Asuka herself.  
“和谁？美里吗？”明日香问。或者是和其他女孩，第一使徒之类的。当碇真嗣僵住并移开视线时，愤怒在她心中闪过，其强烈程度甚至让明日香自己都感到惊讶。

"I asked you a question!"  
"我刚才问了你一个问题！"

"I, just, I went alone..."  
"我，只是，我一个人去了……"

Then she felt contrite at the sight of him, cowering before her anger. It dissipated as quickly as it appeared.  
随后，看到他在她的怒火前畏缩，她感到一阵懊悔。这怒气来得快，去得也快。

"You went to the movies alone? You must be a movie geek or something. I didn't know that."  
"你一个人去看电影？你肯定是个电影迷之类的吧。我还真不知道。"

"Not really," he said with a forced smile. He didn't ask her if _she_ liked movies, either, so that ended the discussion of that particular topic.  
"也不算吧，" 他勉强笑了笑说。他也没问她是否喜欢电影，于是这个话题就此打住了。

It was frustrating. Shinji rarely asked Asuka anything, only giving her a polite smile and the occasional nod. Sometimes Asuka even got the impression that she was the only one willing to carry on a conversation. Of course, that didn't mean Shinji had never asked her a single question. Once, he asked her how Ayanami was doing. The nerve of him. One fiery glare had shut him up, and he'd even apologized to her, but the damage was done. Asuka didn't speak to him for about an hour after that.  
这让人很沮丧。真嗣很少问明日香什么问题，只是礼貌地对她微笑，偶尔点点头。有时候明日香甚至觉得她是唯一一个愿意继续对话的人。当然，这并不意味着真嗣从未问过她任何问题。有一次，他问她绫波怎么样了。真是大胆。一个火辣的眼神让他闭上了嘴，他甚至还向她道歉了，但伤害已经造成。那之后，明日香大约有一个小时没和他说话。

_Maybe he doesn't like this,_ Asuka sometimes wondered. _Maybe that's why he's so unenthusiastic. He's just going along with it. Only tolerating me._  
也许他并不喜欢这样，明日香有时会想。或许这就是他为何如此不热情。他只是在随波逐流。仅仅是在忍受我。

Now that she thought about it, Shinji was _always_ shy, quiet, and not at all talkative. It wouldn't be strange then, if he found what Asuka had been doing for the past few days to be very annoying. But Asuka couldn't understand that. It being humiliating aside, it also didn't make sense; they were dating now (the 'pretending' excuse had been long since forgotten at this point). That meant they should be able to spend time sitting and talking together at the end of the day. Although it wasn't like she had had a boyfriend before, so there was a possibility that she was wrong, but still. The thought that she was putting in a disproportionate amount of effort compared to Shinji often crossed her mind these days.  
现在想来，真嗣总是害羞、安静，一点也不健谈。那么，如果他觉得明日香过去几天所做的事情非常烦人，也就不足为奇了。但明日香无法理解这一点。撇开羞辱不谈，这也不合逻辑；他们现在在交往（“假装”的借口早已被抛诸脑后）。这意味着他们应该能在一天结束时坐在一起聊天。虽然她以前没有男朋友，所以有可能她错了，但尽管如此。最近她常常想到，自己付出的努力与真嗣相比，似乎不成比例。

As the days went by, Asuka rarely saw Misato. The woman would either come home long after Shinji and Asuka had finished eating dinner and were preparing to sleep, or work the night shift and come back home in the morning, take a nap, and then go straight back to work while Asuka was at school. Asuka could only guess that the day after a night shift would include some time at home alone with Shinji, but, unsurprisingly, despite her prodding, Shinji hadn't yet informed Misato of their relationship. Maybe she should take care of that too, Asuka thought, but to do that she needed to actually see the woman first, and that was not happening. Informing her through text or phone just sounded awkward.  
随着日子一天天过去，明日香很少见到美里。这位女性要么在真嗣和明日香吃完晚餐并准备睡觉后很久才回家，要么就是值夜班，早上才回来，小睡一会儿，然后直接回去工作，而那时明日香已经上学去了。明日香只能猜测，夜班后的第二天可能会有些时间在家单独和真嗣相处，但不出所料，尽管她一再催促，真嗣还没有向美里透露他们的关系。也许她也应该处理这件事，明日香想，但要做到这一点，她首先得见到美里，而这根本没发生。通过短信或电话通知她听起来就很尴尬。

And today, which was Friday, Misato was once more nowhere to be seen when Asuka and the First did a regular synchronization test at the headquarters. Even Akagi wasn't there. _Everyone was still busy,_ said the young lieutenant in charge of today's test. Asuka still hadn't memorized her name, but she didn't particularly care to. And of course, Asuka easily beat the First's score. It was nothing special at this point, but Asuka still felt a thrill of triumph.  
而今天，星期五，当明日香和第一适格者在总部进行常规同步测试时，美里再次不见踪影。甚至连赤木律子也不在。负责今天测试的年轻中尉说，大家都很忙。明日香还没记住她的名字，但她并不特别在意。当然，明日香轻松击败了第一适格者的分数。这在现阶段并不特别，但明日香仍然感到一阵胜利的兴奋。

It was when she came home, still high on her victory, that Shinji surprised her.  
就在她带着胜利的喜悦回到家时，真嗣给了她一个惊喜。

"A bath? Really?" “泡澡？真的吗？”

Dressed in an apron and armed with a ladle in one hand, Shinji smiled shyly. "Or do you want to have dinner first? You'd have to wait for that, though. It's not done yet."  
真嗣系着围裙，一手拿着勺子，腼腆地笑着。“还是你想先吃饭？不过得等一会儿，还没做好呢。”

"I showered at HQ! What do you take me for?!"  
"我在总部洗过澡了！你把我当成什么了？！"

"But LCL doesn't come off easily. And nothing beats dipping your body in hot water, right?  
"但 LCL 不容易洗掉。而且没有什么比泡在热水里更舒服的了，对吧？"

"Ha!"

She had no retort to that, so she went to her room and grabbed clothes and underwear to change into. As she crossed the kitchen her eyes met Shinji's. He smiled softly. Not wanting to blush in front of him, she quickly averted her eyes and stomped her feet as if annoyed, almost running for the bathroom.  
她对此无言以对，于是回到房间抓起衣服和内衣准备换上。穿过厨房时，她的目光与真嗣相遇。他温柔地笑了笑。不想在他面前脸红，她迅速移开视线，跺着脚装作生气，几乎是跑向了浴室。

"Must be thinking we're married or something. Acting all housewife-y," she muttered, standing in front of the bathtub. Her voice was grouchy, but her lips were curved upwards in a smile.  
“肯定以为我们结婚了什么的，表现得像个家庭主妇一样。”她站在浴缸前咕哝着，语气虽带抱怨，嘴角却微微上扬，露出一丝笑意。

She remembered a phrase she'd read somewhere. How did it go? _Dinner, bath, or me?_ The stupid thing, straight out of a boys' porn manga, awakened something in Asuka.  
她记得在某处读到过一句话，是怎么说的来着？晚餐、洗澡，还是我？这句直白得如同少年色情漫画中的蠢话，却在明日香心中激起了某种涟漪。

The next moment found her bent over the tub, shooting water between her legs, searching for that sweet spot. She didn't like the spray pattern of this house's showerhead, but she soon bit back a moan as pleasure bloomed between her legs despite the less than optimal water pattern. Then she closed her eyes and imagined Shinji hugging her from behind, his _thing_ pressed against her bottom, rock-hard as always. The undeniable, clear evidence of his affection. The heat of his skin, so much warmer than her own. The smell of him, soap and shampoo and something distinctly masculine, wreathing around her.  
下一刻，她弯腰在浴缸里，让水流穿过双腿间，寻找那令人陶醉的点。她不喜欢这房子花洒的水流模式，但很快，尽管水流不尽如人意，她还是忍不住发出一声低吟，快感在双腿间绽放。随后她闭上眼睛，想象着真嗣从背后拥抱她，他的坚挺抵在她臀部，一如既往地坚硬。他爱意的明确、清晰的证明。他的肌肤，比她自己的温暖得多。他的气息，肥皂和洗发水的香味，还有那独特的男性气息，环绕着她。

Asuka sighed deeply. Thinking of those things was usually enough to make her wet, but this time she needed something more. Something stronger. Now the Shinji in her imagination was stroking, tickling, and grabbing her all over. He also whispered all sorts of things in her ear, things he would never say normally. Things that quickly and continuously switched between gentle confessions and lewd suggestions and almost violent demands. Asuka bit her lips hard. A little moan escaped despite herself. She hoped that the sound of the water covered it up. It was a dangerous thing to do, but the risk only added to the excitement. What if he heard her? What if he opened the door, thinking she was in trouble, and saw her like this? Would he shut the door and run away? Or would he come to her and yank the showerhead out of her hands and push her down to the ground and…  
明日香深深地叹了口气。想到那些事情通常足以让她湿润，但这次她需要更多。更强烈的东西。现在她想象中的真嗣正抚摸、轻挠并抓遍她的全身。他还在她耳边低语各种话语，那些他平时绝不会说出口的话。这些话语迅速且不断地在温柔的告白、淫秽的建议和近乎暴力的要求之间切换。明日香紧咬着嘴唇。尽管如此，还是忍不住发出了一声轻吟。她希望水声能掩盖住这个声音。这样做很危险，但风险反而增添了刺激感。万一他听到了怎么办？万一他以为她遇到了麻烦，推门而入，看到她这副模样怎么办？他会关上门跑开吗？还是会走向她，夺走她手中的花洒，将她推倒在地，然后……

Her legs wobbled. She came not long after that.  
她的双腿颤抖着。不久后，她达到了高潮。

Asuka rinsed off, washed her hair, and soaked her tired body in the hot, steamy water. It had been a good day. A really good day. And there were still good things to come; she had a date tomorrow. She lay there, smiling. It occurred to her, then, that it was only her and Shinji in the house. She thought about what she'd just done. There was nothing and no one to stop her from getting up and leading Shinji in here by the hand and bringing her fantasies to life.  
明日香冲洗干净，洗了头发，疲惫的身体沉浸在热气腾腾的水中。今天真是美好的一天。非常美好的一天。而且还有更多好事即将到来；她明天有个约会。她躺在那里，微笑着。这时，她意识到家里只有她和真嗣两个人。她回想起刚才的所作所为。没有任何人和事能阻止她起身，牵着真嗣的手带他进来，将她的幻想变为现实。

She bit her lip. Misato was rarely around, leaving two teenagers of the opposite sex completely unsupervised. _Seriously, what is she even thinking?_ Asuka wondered. _There really is no one to stop us._  
她咬了咬嘴唇。美里很少在家，留下两个异性青少年完全无人监管。她到底在想什么？明日香疑惑着。确实没有人能阻止我们。

Asuka gritted her teeth slightly at the thought. No, there was someone _else_ stopping them. Someone who would blush and stutter and most likely pussy out.  
想到这里，明日香微微咬紧了牙关。不，还有一个人在阻止他们。那个人会脸红、结巴，很可能临阵退缩。

_Would he?_ Asuka considered Shinji's recent behavior. _I can't help it. I like what I'm seeing,_ he said. Maybe now, she realized, there was a chance he would go along with whatever she suggested. After all, he was the one who tried to steal a kiss when they barely knew each other.  
他会吗？明日香思索着真嗣最近的行为。我控制不住。我喜欢我所看到的，他说。也许现在，她意识到，他有可能接受她提出的任何建议。毕竟，是他们刚认识不久时，他试图偷吻她的那个人。

This kind of development should have made her feel better. It didn't make her feel _bad,_ but it did bring up something that had been nagging at her lately. Every time she thought of it, she felt so helpless, and then disgusted with herself for feeling that way.  
这种发展本应让她感觉更好。这并没有让她感觉不好，但它确实勾起了最近一直困扰她的事情。每次想到这一点，她都感到如此无助，然后对自己感到厌恶。

The question she couldn't ask him that day. _Why do you like me? Besides for my face and my body, obviously._  
那天她无法问他的问题。你为什么喜欢我？除了我的脸和身体，显然。

It occurred to her that heating things up too quickly now would answer that question in a most unpleasant way.  
她突然意识到，现在如果加热得太快，会以一种极其不愉快的方式回答那个问题。

Then, didn't that mean it was Asuka herself, not Misato or Shinji, who was the one stopping them from doing anything naughty?  
那么，这不就意味着阻止他们做任何出格事情的，其实是明日香自己，而不是美里或真嗣吗？

Asuka was aware of the irony. For all this time, she was the one who made the first move, and the means she utilized were mostly physical. She had always wanted to be an adult and to do adult things. But now that the opportunity had presented itself in a very real way, her enthusiasm was diminished. It had been the same way with her period. She'd longed for it because it meant that her body was finally catching up with her brain, but once she'd gotten it, the fantasy vanished and the reality stuck. She knew it was an inextricable part of growing up, but the pain and discomfort it brought made her want to avoid it.  
明日香意识到了其中的讽刺。一直以来，她都是主动出击的那个人，所用的手段大多也是身体上的。她一直渴望长大，去做成年人的事情。但如今，这个机会以一种非常真实的方式摆在她面前，她的热情却减退了。就像她的月经初潮一样。她曾渴望它的到来，因为这意味着她的身体终于跟上了她的思维，但一旦它真的来了，幻想破灭，现实却让人难以忍受。她知道这是成长不可避免的一部分，但伴随而来的疼痛和不适让她想要逃避。

Asuka narrowed her eyes. _And what part of having sex makes me uncomfortable? And why?_  
明日香眯起了眼睛。性爱中的哪一部分让我感到不适？又为何如此？

The answer came up immediately in the form of her stepmother's face. The sound of moans that drifted from the office next door every time Asuka visited Mama. The wedding, less than half a year after they put Mama in the cold ground. Her red face at Oktoberfest, with a beer mug in one hand and the other around Papa's neck, kissing him, to cheers from the crowd.  
答案立刻浮现，以她继母的面容呈现。每次明日香探望妈妈时，从隔壁办公室传来的呻吟声。妈妈下葬不到半年就举行的婚礼。她在十月节上通红的脸庞，一手拿着啤酒杯，另一手环抱爸爸的脖子，亲吻他，人群中响起欢呼声。

Asuka closed her eyes and submerged herself up to her chin. The hot mist filled her nose, tickling it.  
明日香闭上眼睛，将身体浸至下巴。热气充满了她的鼻腔，轻轻地搔痒着。

_No reason to think about those things. Today is a nice day, don't ruin it,_ Asuka told herself, clearing her mind.  
没有理由去想那些事情。今天是个好日子，别毁了它，明日香告诉自己，清空思绪。

When Asuka emerged from the bathroom after some time, refreshed both in body and mind, Shinji was sitting at the fully set dinner table, waiting for her. Unable to look at his face right after masturbating to him, Asuka avoided eye contact and barely spoke. She asked if he had told Misato about their date tomorrow, and while Shinji stammered and apologized that he _hadn't,_ she sighed. That was the extent of their conversation during the meal.  
当明日香从浴室出来，身心焕然一新时，真嗣已经坐在摆满晚餐的桌前等她。刚对着他自慰完，明日香无法直视他的脸，她避开目光，几乎没说话。她问真嗣是否告诉了美里他们明天的约会，真嗣结巴着道歉说没有，她叹了口气。这就是他们晚餐时的全部对话。

After the awkwardness at dinner, Asuka retreated to her room and lay down. There were still a few things she needed to take care of before bed, but for now, she just wanted to rest for a while. Soon, she heard Misato arrive, exchange greetings with Shinji, and start eating a late dinner, but Asuka ignored it. It wasn't until some time later, when the house was quiet and she heard Shinji go into his room, that Asuka got up from her bed and marched to Misato's door.  
晚餐的尴尬过后，明日香回到自己的房间躺下。睡前还有几件事要处理，但此刻她只想休息一会儿。很快，她听到美里回来，和真嗣打招呼，开始吃迟来的晚餐，但明日香没理会。直到一段时间后，屋子安静下来，她听到真嗣进了自己的房间，明日香才从床上起身，走向美里的房门。

The sound of the hair dryer rang through the whole apartment. Asuka briefly considered knocking, then decided it wouldn't be heard anyway, so she flung the door open. Even that didn't catch Misato's attention, so Asuka had to call her name several times until she turned the dryer off and turned her head towards her. Misato smiled brightly, strands of damp black hair clinging to her cheeks.  
吹风机的声音响彻整个公寓。明日香短暂地考虑了一下是否要敲门，随即决定反正也听不见，便猛地推开了门。即便如此，也没能引起美里注意，明日香不得不多次呼唤她的名字，直到她关掉吹风机，转过头来。美里灿烂地笑着，几缕湿漉漉的黑发贴在脸颊上。

"Hey there, stranger, haven't seen you in a while. I was a little disappointed that even when I got home a bit early you were already asleep. You were sleeping, right?"  
“嘿，好久不见，陌生人。我有点失望，即使我早些回家，你已经睡着了。你当时在睡觉，对吧？”

"I woke up." “我醒了。”

"Because of me? Sorry." "因为我？抱歉。"

Asuka wanted to snort as the older woman smiled cutely and stuck her tongue out a bit. _Will you please act like an actual adult?_ "Doesn't matter. I had to tell you something. About tomorrow."  
明日香本想嗤之以鼻，但那位年长的女性却可爱地笑了笑，还稍稍吐了吐舌头。你能表现得像个真正的成年人吗？“没关系。我有些事情必须告诉你。关于明天。”

"Oh, right, tomorrow. I should have asked Shinji, too." Misato set the dryer down on the vanity and turned fully around. "Asuka, remember the dinner I promised before? How about tomorrow? I'm free for the first time in a while. And Shinji's in better shape, too. Let's go out, all three of us. How about that?"  
"哦，对了，明天。我也应该问问真嗣。" 美里把吹风机放在梳妆台上，完全转过身来。"明日香，还记得我之前承诺的晚餐吗？明天怎么样？我终于有空了。而且真嗣的状态也好多了。我们三个人一起出去吧。你觉得如何？"

_Oh, that._ Asuka wrinkled her nose. _I almost forgot_. Well, it didn't matter anyway. The matter would be solved one way or the other by the time Asuka was done with hers. Asuka calmed her beating heart, and meticulously repeated the line she had prepared all along.  
哦，那个啊。明日香皱了皱鼻子。我差点忘了。反正也没什么大不了的。等明日香处理完她的，事情总会以某种方式解决的。明日香平复了跳动的心，小心翼翼地重复着她早已准备好的台词。

"No. I'm going to hang out with Shinji tomorrow. Dinner. And a movie too."  
“不，我明天要和真嗣出去。吃饭，还有看电影。”

Asuka didn't miss how Misato's expression stiffened just the smallest bit. In response Asuka squared her shoulders and lifted her chin slightly, eyes glittering defiantly.  
明日香没有错过美里表情中那一丝微妙的僵硬。作为回应，明日香挺直了肩膀，微微抬起下巴，眼中闪烁着挑衅的光芒。

What did Misato expect, anyway? After teasing her about that stupid perfume, after practically begging her to visit Shinji in the hospital, after giving her that nasty, all-knowing smile when Asuka told her to not bother them for a day so they could study kanji in peace, Misato had no right to act surprised. Asuka had rehearsed in her head all sorts of scenarios for how Misato would react and her arguments against every single one, so she was quite confident that she wouldn't need to hesitate even for a moment once Misato shut her mouth.  
话说回来，美里到底期待什么呢？先是拿那瓶愚蠢的香水调侃她，然后几乎是恳求她去医院看望真嗣，再在她告诉美里别打扰他们一天以便安静学习汉字时，露出那种讨厌的、一切尽在掌握的笑容，美里根本没资格表现得这么惊讶。明日香在脑海中预演了各种美里可能的反应以及如何反驳每一种，所以她相当自信，一旦美里闭嘴，她绝不会犹豫哪怕一瞬间。

It's just that Misato didn't react the way she expected.  
只是，美里并没有按她预想的那样反应。

The woman smiled weakly, looked down at Asuka's feet for a moment, and then gave her a slight nod. "Sure. Have fun."  
女人虚弱地笑了笑，低头看了一眼明日香的脚，然后轻轻点了点头。“当然。玩得开心。”

Asuka was expecting some sort of pushback, so she was momentarily stumped in the face of Misato's acquiescence. She couldn't even fathom the older woman's motives at the moment, but then she realized that they didn't matter right this second. So Asuka just snorted and turned away.  
明日香本以为会遭到某种程度的反对，所以面对美里顺从的态度，她一时语塞。她此刻完全无法揣测这位年长女性的动机，但随即意识到，眼下这些并不重要。于是明日香只是哼了一声，转身离开。

One problem taken care of. Asuka returned to her room and decided to deal with the second, arguably more important one: what to wear tomorrow.  
一个问题解决了。明日香回到自己的房间，决定着手处理第二个，可以说是更为重要的一个问题：明天该穿什么。

It wasn't until arguably half of her closet was strewn across the floor that Asuka remembered something she had forgotten. Tossing away the yellow dress she had worn to impress him before she even knew his name, Asuka headed for Shinji's room. By the time she stood in his doorway, she realized she was only in a bra and shorts. A part of her shifted, disquieted for reasons she didn't want to analyze at the moment. She pushed it down and narrowed her eyes. What would his reaction be to her appearing to him like this? She lifted her chin and pushed open the door.  
直到她几乎把半个衣柜的衣服都摊在了地上，明日香才想起自己忘了件事。她扔掉了那件曾为了给他留下印象而穿的黄色连衣裙，那时她甚至还不认识他。明日香朝真嗣的房间走去。当她站在他的房门口时，她意识到自己只穿着胸罩和短裤。一部分的她感到不安，原因她此刻不愿深究。她压下这种感觉，眯起眼睛。他会对她这样出现在他面前有何反应？她抬起下巴，推开了门。

Shinji was lying on his bed with earbuds in his ears. The light was on, but the way he lay with his eyes closed made him look like he was sleeping. Asuka wondered what the hell he was listening to all the time. She added it to her list of things to figure out someday.  
真嗣躺在床上，耳朵里塞着耳机。灯光亮着，但他闭着眼睛的样子看起来就像在睡觉。明日香好奇他到底一直在听什么。她把这个加到了她某天要弄清楚的事情清单上。

Asuka stomped over to the bed and shook Shinji's shoulder. "Idiot. Wake up."  
明日香大步走到床边，摇晃着真嗣的肩膀。"白痴。醒醒。"

Asuka watched with satisfaction as Shinji blushed furiously as soon as he opened his eyes. He scrambled to his feet, pulling out the earbuds out of his ears. All the while his eyes darted between her belly and chest. "Wha, what is it?"  
明日香满意地看着真嗣一睁开眼睛就满脸通红。他慌忙起身，拔出耳朵里的耳机。与此同时，他的目光在她的小腹和胸部之间来回游移。"什，什么事？"

"Hey, do you have anything to wear tomorrow?"  
"嘿，你明天有什么可穿的吗？"

She could have waited until tomorrow, hoping for him to surprise her, but she knew better than that. Sure enough, Shinji's reaction said everything she expected. She clicked her tongue at his widening eyes. Shinji dropped his gaze to Asuka's feet and scratched his head.  
她本可以等到明天，期待他给她一个惊喜，但她比那更了解情况。果然，真嗣的反应完全符合她的预期。她咂了咂舌，看着他瞪大的眼睛。真嗣的目光落在明日香的脚上，挠了挠头。

"I guess I couldn't wear my usual uniform. Maybe I should go out in the morning and-"  
"我想我不能穿平时的制服了。也许我应该早上出去买——"

"I'll be at school by then. Are you saying you're going to go shopping by yourself?"  
"那时我会在学校。你是说你要自己一个人去购物？"

"Why not?" "为什么不行？"

Asuka shuddered. Shinji undoubtedly neither knew nor cared what actually looked good and would probably buy some tasteless trash that would make her feel ashamed to be seen in public with him.  
明日香打了个寒颤。真嗣无疑既不知道也不在乎什么才是真正好看的东西，他很可能会买一些毫无品味、让她觉得和他一起出门都感到丢脸的垃圾。

"How about this. Let's eat lunch at home and then go out, starting the whole date earlier."  
"这样如何。我们在家吃午饭，然后早点出门，把整个约会提前开始。"

Shinji smiled and looked up, then blushed again. Asuka gave a slight nod and left, closing the door behind her.  
真嗣微笑着抬头，随即又脸红了。明日香微微点头，转身离开，顺手关上了门。

As soon as she left Shinji's room, she saw Misato standing at the end of the hallway, on the edge of the kitchen, looking this way. _I thought she was sleeping. Did she hear the whole thing?_ Asuka crossed her arms and returned her gaze.  
她一离开真嗣的房间，就看到美里站在走廊尽头，靠近厨房的地方，朝这边看。我以为她在睡觉。她听到了全部吗？明日香交叉双臂，回以目光。

Misato looked down at the can of beer she held in one hand with an odd smile. Then she looked up again. "Do you guys have enough money?"  
美里低头看着手中握着的啤酒罐，脸上带着奇怪的微笑。然后她再次抬头。"你们俩钱够用吗？"

Asuka shrugged. "_Someone's_ not being generous with allowance, but I can afford some fun once in a while. Not like I'm the one drinking all night."  
明日香耸了耸肩。“某人给的零花钱可真抠门，不过我偶尔也能享受点乐趣。又不是我整晚都在喝酒。”

"Okay. Good night." With that, Misato headed back to her room. She didn't even comment on Asuka's clothes. Asuka watched her retreating back, then she too returned to her room.  
“好吧，晚安。”说完，美里便回自己房间去了。她甚至没对明日香的衣着发表意见。明日香看着她离去的背影，随后也回到了自己的房间。

_All in all, it was a pretty good day,_ Asuka thought as she lay in bed. There were some things that almost disappointed her, but it all ended up working out. She couldn't wait to see how good tomorrow would turn out, and with that thought in mind, she happily drifted off to sleep.  
总的来说，今天算是相当不错的一天，明日香躺在床上想。虽然有些事情差点让她失望，但最终都顺利解决了。她迫不及待想知道明天会有多精彩，带着这样的期待，她心满意足地进入了梦乡。

---

"Maybe we can do a double date soon."  
"或许我们不久可以来个双重约会。"

Misato almost lost the piece of meat she was picking up off the grill. Wagyu was a little too fatty for her taste, so she bathed it thoroughly in sauce with a sigh.  
美里差点没夹住从烤架上挑起的那块肉。和牛肉对她来说脂肪略多，她叹了口气，将肉浸透在酱汁中。

"Don't even joke about that."  
"别开这种玩笑。"

Kaji rested his chin on one hand, smirking, while using the other to place a few more chunks of meat on the grill. The sizzle that followed briefly overpowered the surrounding noise.  
加治用一只手托着下巴，嘴角挂着一丝微笑，另一只手则往烤架上又放了几块肉。随之而来的嘶嘶声短暂地盖过了周围的喧闹。

"Well, I guess that solves one mystery."  
“好吧，我想这解开了一个谜团。”

"What mystery?" Misato asked while chewing. It was rude, but they'd both seen worse from each other anyway.  
“什么谜团？”美里边嚼边问。虽然这有些失礼，但他们彼此都见过对方更糟糕的一面。

"I haven't heard from Asuka for days. No texts, no calls…total radio silence, actually. It's been a week as of today. A new record. I'm almost starting to miss all those messages. Not really, but you know what I mean."  
"我已经好几天没收到明日香的消息了。没有短信，没有电话……完全是音讯全无。今天已经整整一周了。创了新纪录。我几乎开始怀念那些信息了。也不完全是，但你知道我的意思。"

_I wish she could hear you now,_ Misato thought, and then shook her head slightly. She knew who would have to deal with the aftermath.  
真希望她现在能听到你说的，美里想，然后轻轻摇了摇头。她知道谁将不得不处理后续。

Kaji continued, turning the meat chunks over.  
加持继续翻动着肉块。

"Well, I guess if Asuka shifts her attention, it'd be-"  
"嗯，我想如果明日香转移注意力的话，那会是——"

"I don't know." "我不知道。"

"Huh?" “啊？”

Misato waved her chopsticks slightly. "I don't think Asuka is consciously doing it. I don't think she's even thought about contacting you. She's head over heels lately. I mean, both of them are."  
美里轻轻挥动着筷子。“我觉得明日香并不是有意识地这么做。她甚至可能没想过要联系你。她最近完全沉浸在自己的世界里。我是说，他们俩都是。”

Kaji shrugged. "Well, it doesn't change the point, anyway. It'd be better for everyone if she keeps doing what she's doing."  
加持耸了耸肩。“好吧，无论如何，这并不改变重点。如果她继续做她正在做的事，对大家都会更好。”

And that was what had been bothering Misato for the past few days: whether it was really for the best. She felt partially responsible - she had, after all, encouraged it.  
这就是让美里过去几天心烦意乱的原因：这真的是最好的选择吗？她觉得自己也有一部分责任——毕竟，是她鼓励了这件事。

So Misato voiced that suspicion. Maybe this was exactly why she had called Kaji today.  
于是美里表达了这个疑虑。也许这就是她今天给加持打电话的原因。

"I'm honestly not sure I agree."  
“老实说，我不确定我是否同意。”

Kaji's hand stopped. After a while Misato smiled bitterly and pointed her chopsticks at the grill. "They're burning."  
加持的手停了下来。过了一会儿，美里苦笑着用筷子指向烤架。“它们要糊了。”

"Sorry." "对不起。"

Silence fell for a moment as Kaji shuffled through the pieces, cutting away the worst of the burns with scissors. The only sound was the murmur of conversation in the next room behind the paper partition. It was Misato who broke the silence after feeling Kaji's eyes on her the entire time, eyes that could have been asking questions or simply observing, already knowing and understanding everything.  
沉默笼罩了一会儿，加持用剪刀剪去最焦的部分，整理着碎片。唯一的声音是纸隔板另一侧房间里的低语交谈。是美里打破了沉默，她一直感觉到加持的目光停留在她身上，那目光可能是在提问，也可能只是在观察，已经知晓并理解一切。

"I'm not sure if it's okay for those two to get that close. They're definitely going to get hurt later."  
“我不确定那两个人靠得那么近是否合适。他们以后肯定会受伤的。”

_Like me. Like us_, Misato didn't add.  
像我一样。像我们一样，Misato 没说出口。

After placing the slightly overcooked pieces on Misato's plate, Kaji beat the plate with the tongs. Misato flinched, startled from her reverie by the noise, and then glared at Kaji.  
在将稍微煮过头的肉片放在 Misato 的盘子上后，Kaji 用夹子敲了敲盘子。Misato 吓了一跳，被这声音从沉思中惊醒，然后瞪了 Kaji 一眼。

He responded with an odd smile. "Everyone goes through that phase at that age. It's a normal part of growing up. It's just our generation that missed out on all that stuff."  
他以一种奇怪的微笑回应。“每个人在那个年纪都会经历那样的阶段。这是成长的一部分。只是我们这一代错过了所有那些东西。”

"You know there's nothing normal about them. Especially Asuka."  
"你知道他们都不正常，尤其是明日香。"

Kaji moved the few pieces of meat that remained on the grill to his plate. "Well, nevertheless, they still need to go through it at some point, unless you're saying they should spend the rest of their lives not loving anyone. Whatever happens, they'll learn, and they'll grow."  
加持将烤架上仅剩的几片肉移到自己的盘子里。“无论如何，他们总有一天要经历这些，除非你说他们应该一辈子不去爱任何人。无论发生什么，他们都会学到东西，都会成长。”

Misato picked up the meat and stared at it for a moment, then snickered.  
美里拿起肉，盯着它看了一会儿，然后轻声笑了起来。

"We don't know that." _If I had learned anything from the last time I was with you, I wouldn't be here._ "Besides, there's a time and a place for everything. I don't want the relationship between my two subordinates to become too volatile at this delicate time. This isn't just about two kids. The stakes are too high."  
"我们并不确定。" 如果上次和你在一起时我学到了什么，我就不会在这里了。"再说了，凡事都有其时机和场合。我不希望我的两个下属在这敏感时刻关系变得过于紧张。这不仅仅是两个孩子的问题。风险太高了。"

As soon as the words were out of her mouth, Misato felt immensely disgusted with herself. Unable to look Kaji in the face, Misato dipped the meat in the sauce and brought it to her mouth. It wasn't that Misato didn't care about those kids, both as soldiers and on a personal level. Maybe emphasizing the public and official aspects of her and the children's relationship was just a defense mechanism. A way to alleviate her embarrassment at showing a level of empathy for her subordinates that was unprofessional for NERV's Operations Director. And no matter what her motives were, she thought that any decisions she made were with the best interests of the children in mind.  
话一出口，美里就对自己感到极度厌恶。她无法直视加持的脸，只好将肉蘸上酱汁送入口中。并非美里不在乎那些孩子，无论是作为士兵还是个人层面。或许强调她与孩子们之间公事公办的关系，只是一种防御机制。一种缓解她作为 NERV 作战部长对下属表现出不合职业规范的同情心时的尴尬的方式。无论她的动机如何，她认为自己的任何决定都是出于孩子们的最佳利益。

At least, that's what she wanted to believe.  
至少，这是她想要相信的。

Misato sighed. "I thought about splitting them up."  
美里叹了口气。“我考虑过把他们分开。”

Kaji lifted his cup, moistened his lips with beer, and set it back down. "Why didn't you?"  
加持举起杯子，用啤酒润了润嘴唇，然后放回原处。“那你为什么没这么做？”

"Because it wouldn't work anyway. It's not like we can completely cut them off from each other, and there's nothing we could do about the feelings that have already formed."  
“因为无论如何这都行不通。我们不可能完全切断他们之间的联系，而且那些已经形成的感情我们也无能为力。”

Kaji's lips curled up. "I agree."  
加持的嘴角上扬。“我同意。”

"Really?" "真的吗？"

"You're convinced that things are going to end badly between the two, Katsuragi. I'm not going to comment on how true it is. Surely you know better than I do. So, if the outcome is going to be the same no matter what, why be the cause? There's no point in butting in and making them hold a grudge against you. It's best to let things take their natural course."  
“你确信他们俩的关系会以糟糕收场，葛城。我无意评论这有多真实。你肯定比我更清楚。既然结果无论如何都一样，为何要成为原因呢？插手进去让他们对你怀恨在心毫无意义。最好还是让事情顺其自然发展。”

The words did not comfort Misato at all. She watched as Kaji placed more meat on the grill, at a loss for words. _You're so... like yourself, Kaji. But am I that different?_  
这些话丝毫没有安慰到美里。她看着加持又在烤架上放了更多的肉，无言以对。你真是...一如既往，加持。但我真的有那么不同吗？

"So, Katsuragi. They'll be a little late today, right?"  
“那么，葛城。他们今天会晚一点到，对吧？”

Misato snorted. "Well, no. They're probably watching a movie right now, but they shouldn't be that late. I gave them a firm warning to come back before ten o'clock."  
美里哼了一声。“嗯，不会。他们现在可能正在看电影，但应该不会那么晚。我严厉警告过他们十点前必须回来。”

Kaji let out an exaggerated sigh. "I was hoping we could use your place as the second spot."  
加持发出夸张的叹息。“我还以为我们可以用你家作为第二个地点呢。”

_Of course you only want that._ Misato stuck her tongue out. "Too bad."  
当然你只想要那个。美里伸出舌头。“太糟糕了。”

Kaji leaned across the table.  
加持俯身越过桌子。

"Still, it's rude to invite someone out and then run off so quickly. I know a nice bar nearby. How about a drink?"  
“不过，邀请别人出来又这么快跑掉，未免太失礼了。我知道附近有家不错的酒吧。喝一杯如何？”

Misato shook her head. "I can't. I'm busy tomorrow."  
美里摇了摇头。“我不行，明天很忙。”

"But tomorrow is Sunday."  
“但明天是星期天啊。”

"I'm not making up excuses. I've been invited to lunch tomorrow. An event hosted by some committee under the city council. I'm supposed to represent NERV at the luncheon."  
“我不是在找借口。我明天被邀请去吃午饭。是市议会下属某个委员会举办的活动。我得代表 NERV 出席午餐会。”

"You can still have just one drink, can't you?"  
"你还是可以只喝一杯的，对吧？"

_If it actually ends up like that._ Misato frowned slightly. "I'll finish my meat first and think about it."  
如果真的变成那样的话。美里微微皱眉。“我先把肉吃完，再考虑喝酒的事。”

---

Shinji woke up that morning with something akin to dread. He'd overstepped yesterday and ruined Asuka's mood, he was sure of it. Preparing a bath? Forcing her into it? Ugh, it was definitely too much. On top of all that he'd let her down right before bed by not even having anything decent to wear. He wasn't sure if he could be good company on a date. He wasn't sure if he could meet Asuka's standards. But he never thought he'd mess the date up before the damn thing even started.  
那天早上，真嗣醒来时心中充满了类似恐惧的感觉。他确信自己昨天越界了，破坏了明日香的心情。准备洗澡水？强迫她洗澡？唉，这肯定太过分了。更糟糕的是，他在睡前让她失望了，因为他连一件像样的衣服都没有。他不确定自己是否能在约会中表现得体。他不确定自己是否能达到明日香的标准。但他从未想过会在约会开始之前就把事情搞砸。

But contrary to Shinji's fears, Asuka seemed to be in a good mood today. She was breathing down his neck as soon as she got home from school, practically vibrating from excitement. Once they finished eating lunch, she washed up and changed into the yellow dress she'd been wearing the day they met. It stunned him just as much now as it did then.  
但出乎真嗣的担忧，明日香今天似乎心情很好。她一放学回家就紧跟在他身后，兴奋得几乎要跳起来。吃完午饭后，她洗漱完毕，换上了他们初次见面时穿的那条黄色连衣裙。这一幕如今依旧让他为之震撼，正如当时一样。

Her mood only seemed to get better as they made their way to the city center. Once they disembarked from the station, Asuka began dragging him from place to place. This perky and energetic side of her was new and invigorating, and it warmed Shinji's heart to know that he was at least partially the cause of its emergence.  
随着他们前往市中心，她的情绪似乎愈发高涨。一出车站，明日香就开始拉着他四处逛。她这种活泼好动的样子是新奇且令人振奋的，真嗣心中感到温暖，至少在一定程度上，他觉得自己是这份变化的催化剂。

As far as Shinji was concerned, he didn't mind changing into different outfits over and over again like a doll. He wasn't the one doing the hard work of picking out pieces of clothing and somehow coordinating them into cohesive outfits. And even then, Asuka wasn't always satisfied. Each time he stepped out of the dressing room, Asuka would make a face and nod or shake her head. It was kind of cute, honestly, and Shinji found himself smiling fondly every time he disappeared back into the dressing room. Shinji even had the occasional opportunity to offer his input, although all of his opinions were discarded by Asuka with a shake of her head. Afterwards, she even paid for the clothes. She was the one picking them out, so it was her responsibility to pay for them, plus they weren't that expensive anyway, she said. Shinji didn't anticipate either of her choices (a white short-sleeved polo shirt and jeans, which were very plain, in Shinji's opinion, especially after spending over an hour in the shop) or her insistence on paying.  
就真嗣而言，他并不介意像玩偶一样一遍遍更换不同的服装。挑选衣物并设法将它们搭配成协调的整体这种费力的工作并不是他来做。即便如此，明日香也并非总是满意。每当他走出试衣间，明日香总会做出表情，点头或摇头。老实说，这挺可爱的，真嗣发现自己每次他再回到试衣间时都会露出温柔的微笑。真嗣偶尔也有机会提出自己的意见，尽管他的所有建议都被明日香摇头否决了。之后，她甚至支付了衣服的费用。是她挑选的，所以由她来付款是她的责任，何况这些衣服本身也不贵，她解释道。真嗣对她的选择（一件白色短袖马球衫和牛仔裤，在真嗣看来非常朴素，尤其是在店里花了超过一个小时之后）和她坚持付款的做法都感到意外。

What was really hard for Shinji to bear was the endless shopping that followed. It was like an intensely boring safari, a dizzying array of shoppers taking the place of exotic animals. Asuka led the charge into what felt like every single luxury store, squinting at unfathomable, overpriced knick-knacks coated in rhinestones and fake crocodile skin and humming thoughtfully to herself. She also tried every perfume sample in sight, to the point that Shinji was starting to feel dizzy. As Asuka asked what he thought of yet another too-sweet scent undercut by the distinct heady sharpness of alcohol, he wondered distantly if this was what it felt like to be drunk. He was immensely relieved when Asuka declared that it was time to leave the department store and led him to the train station.  
对真嗣来说，真正难以忍受的是随后无休止的购物之旅。这就像一场极度无聊的狩猎旅行，各式各样的购物者取代了异域动物，令人眼花缭乱。明日香带头冲进仿佛每一家奢侈品店，眯着眼睛审视那些价格高昂、难以理解的装饰品，它们镶嵌着水钻，包裹着仿鳄鱼皮，她一边哼着小曲，一边若有所思。她还尝试了所有能看到的香水样品，以至于真嗣开始感到头晕目眩。当明日香询问他对又一款过于甜腻、夹杂着明显酒精浓香的香水有何看法时，他恍惚间觉得这或许就是醉酒的感觉。当明日香宣布是时候离开百货公司，并带他前往火车站时，他感到无比宽慰。

The train took them a fair distance, to an outlet mall situated rather forlornly on the edge of a suburb. Shinji suppressed a sigh. It was even bigger than the shopping center they had just left. Only after covering about half of that mind-numbing expanse did Shinji suggest that maybe they should return to the city proper, trying his level best to keep the desperation out of his tone. It was getting close to dinnertime, after all, and if they stayed here much longer, they might not make it to the movie in time or would be forced to skip dinner entirely. Asuka mercifully agreed, putting an end to the march of madness. Shinji almost cried out of sheer relief.  
火车载着他们驶出了相当一段距离，来到了一个位于郊区边缘、显得颇为孤寂的直销购物中心。真嗣压抑住一声叹息。这里甚至比他们刚刚离开的购物中心还要大。在覆盖了大约一半令人头晕目眩的区域后，真嗣才提议或许他们应该返回市区，竭尽全力不让绝望的语气流露出来。毕竟，晚餐时间已经临近，如果他们在这里逗留太久，可能会赶不上电影，或者被迫完全放弃晚餐。明日香仁慈地同意了，结束了这场疯狂的行军。真嗣几乎因纯粹的解脱而哭了出来。

The worst part was that she didn't even buy anything! The shopping bag in his hand contained nothing but his neatly folded school uniform, which he'd changed out of once Asuka paid for his new outfit. It would have been easier to justify his suffering if by the end they at least had something to show for it.  
最糟糕的是，她甚至什么都没买！他手中的购物袋里只装着他那件叠得整整齐齐的校服，这是他在明日香为他买下新衣服后换下来的。如果到最后他们至少能有所收获，他的痛苦或许更容易被理解。

And also the stares. Shinji knew, on an abstract, intellectual level, how much attention Asuka drew, but traveling with her and experiencing it first-hand was a different story. Some of it even bounced off onto him, which was something he was honestly not prepared for. On the train, on the street, boys his own age or slightly older stared at Asuka and pointed fingers at Shinji, muttering amongst themselves. Groups of girls would look over and giggle; Shinji wasn't in on the joke. Adults weren't as obnoxious about it, but nonchalant glances from them were still all too common. At every store they entered, the clerks, especially the men, gave Shinji a knowing smile (or maybe he was imagining them - he was not sure at this point). Asuka didn't seem the least bit bothered by it, as if she was already used to it. Shinji thought her poise was genuinely admirable.  
还有那些目光。在抽象的理智层面，真嗣明白明日香吸引了多少注意力，但与她同行并亲身体验这一切，则是另一回事。有些目光甚至反射到他身上，这是他始料未及的。在火车上，在街道上，与他同龄或稍长的男孩们盯着明日香，同时用手指着真嗣，窃窃私语。一群群女孩会望过来，咯咯地笑；真嗣却不知笑点何在。成年人对此不那么露骨，但漫不经心的打量依然屡见不鲜。每进一家店，店员们，尤其是男性，都会对真嗣露出意味深长的微笑（或许只是他臆想——他此时已不太确定）。明日香对此似乎毫不在意，仿佛早已习以为常。真嗣觉得她的从容实在令人钦佩。

He was feeling utterly exhausted by the end of it. He alternated between breaking into a cold sweat and feeling short of breath, making him wonder with no small degree of nervousness if his phantom pain was on the verge of returning. When they finally arrived at the family restaurant near the theater, Shinji almost breathed a sigh of relief. He pretended to not notice Asuka's obvious desire to sit by the window and instead walked straight to a table in a blessedly secluded corner.  
到最后，他感到筋疲力尽。他时而冒冷汗，时而喘不过气，这让他不禁紧张地怀疑，自己的幻痛是否即将复发。当他们终于抵达剧院附近的家庭餐厅时，真嗣几乎松了一口气。他佯装未察觉明日香明显想坐在窗边的愿望，径直走向一个幸运的僻静角落。

Surprisingly, Asuka didn't show any signs of exhaustion even by then. As they ordered two plates of hamburger steak, waited, and ate after the food came out, Asuka chattered nonstop. Shinji had thought he'd heard all the gossip there was to hear over the past few days, but apparently he'd been deeply, deeply wrong. Asuka spouted a seemingly infinite stream of rumors of dubious quality, tales of ruinous grudges and clandestine affairs and petty crimes, her opinions on this or that schoolmate, how everything was both exactly the same and completely different from her school back in Germany. She must be telling him the things she couldn't say in front of the other girls, Shinji thought as he listened with a sort of detached fascination. He was a total outsider to class politics, unaffiliated with any of the larger or smaller cliques, and didn't have anyone to blab to anyway. Toji had no patience for this sort of thing, and Ayanami probably wouldn't be able to wrap her head around it in the first place. He couldn't really wrap his head around it either. The things kids his age got up to these days!  
出乎意料的是，直到那时，明日香都没有显露出一丝疲态。他们点了两份汉堡肉排，等待并享用着上桌的美食，明日香喋喋不休地说个不停。真嗣本以为过去几天已经听遍了所有八卦，显然他大错特错了。明日香滔滔不绝地讲述着质量存疑的传闻，毁灭性的怨恨、秘密恋情和琐碎罪行，她对这位或那位同学的看法，以及这里的一切如何既与她在德国的学校如出一辙又截然不同。真嗣一边听，一边觉得她可能在告诉他那些不能在其他女孩面前说的话。他对班级政治一无所知，不属于任何大大小小的圈子，也没有人可以倾诉。剑介对此类事情毫无耐心，而绫波可能根本无法理解。真嗣自己也难以完全理解。同龄人如今都在忙些什么啊！

But it wasn't the content of Asuka's chatter that really fascinated Shinji. He didn't feel the need to interrupt her. Rather, he found himself dreamily watching Asuka herself. How quickly her pink lips moved. Her lip gloss glistened hypnotically under the fluorescent lights. The shape of her eyes, foreign and strange, the way they drooped down ever so slightly at the corners. How blue they were, how full of life. They were the same eyes he looked into every day, but something was different about them now. Something gentle and soft lurked in them as they looked into his.  
但真正让真嗣着迷的，并非明日香话语的内容。他并不觉得有必要打断她，反而发现自己梦幻般地注视着明日香本人。她粉嫩的双唇动得多么迅速，唇彩在荧光灯下闪耀着迷人的光泽。她眼型的异国情调，微微下垂的眼角，以及那双充满生机的湛蓝眼眸。这些他每天都会对视的眼睛，此刻却有些不同。在那双眼睛里，潜藏着某种温柔和柔软，当它们凝视着他时。

Shinji felt his heart skip a beat. She was being so open with him right now in a way she'd never really been before. The realization of the nature of the situation struck a chord in him.  
真嗣感到心跳漏了一拍。她现在以一种前所未有的方式对他敞开心扉。意识到这一情境的本质，在他心中激起了共鸣。

Just like he had every time he and Asuka had sat together this week, Shinji felt satisfied and full just watching her talk. Even after the afternoon's march, Shinji had completely forgotten how hungry he was, mesmerized by the girl in front of him. It wasn't until Asuka suddenly gave him a strange look and pointed to his plate that he realized he'd eaten less than a third of the food he'd ordered. Asuka was already close to finishing hers. There wasn't much time left until the movie started. Even eating as fast as he could, he was forced to leave a sizable portion. It stung. Especially because he paid for it.  
就像这周他和明日香每次坐在一起时一样，真嗣只是看着她说话就感到心满意足。尽管下午的游行后，真嗣完全忘记了饥饿的感觉，被眼前的女孩深深吸引。直到明日香突然给了他一个奇怪的眼神，指了指他的盘子，他才意识到自己只吃掉了点单食物的不到三分之一。明日香已经快要吃完她的那份了。离电影开始没多少时间了。即使他尽可能快地吃，也不得不留下相当一部分。这让他感到心疼。尤其是因为他为此付了钱。

After they'd paid, they hurried to the movie theater. He'd spent the night there once before, when he ran away from Misato's house. The long summer day was finally over, but in this part of town things were only just getting started. After a short walk through the bars and more questionable businesses that were opening up, they arrived at the theater, slightly closer to the main road and in a 'cleaner' part of the city.  
付完账后，他们匆匆赶往电影院。他曾有一次在那里过夜，那时他从美里家跑了出来。漫长的夏日终于结束，但在这片街区，一切才刚刚开始。穿过那些正开张的酒吧和更可疑的店铺，他们走了一段短途，来到了电影院，这里离主干道更近，位于城市中相对“干净”的区域。

The movie was just a standard romcom that he chose because there wasn't anything else showing at this time today. Honestly, he didn't even know anything about it. Even after buying the tickets, he didn't know what to expect. Shinji was only vaguely aware of the name of one of the main actors.  
这部电影只是一部普通的浪漫喜剧，他选择它只是因为今天这个时间段没有其他电影在上映。老实说，他对这部电影一无所知。甚至在买了票之后，他也不知道会看到什么。真嗣只是隐约知道其中一位主演的名字。

The first time anything of note happened was at the concession stand. Shinji decided that since he hadn't had a proper dinner, he should get some popcorn and a drink to wash it down. That meant a drink for Asuka too. So he asked her what she wanted to drink, and placed his order with the clerk, who then decided to put him on the spot.  
第一次值得一提的事情发生在小吃摊前。真嗣决定，既然他没有好好吃晚饭，他应该买些爆米花和饮料来搭配。这意味着也要给明日香买一杯饮料。于是他问她想要喝什么，然后向售货员下单，结果售货员决定让他难堪。

"You can have the same thing for cheaper if you order a couple's set. Want to change the order?"  
“如果你点情侣套餐的话，同样的饮料会更便宜。要改成套餐吗？”

Shinji felt his stomach tightening. "What?"  
真嗣感到胃部一阵紧缩。“什么？”

The clerk pointed to the menu. And there it was, in bold letters on one panel. _Couple's Set. Two medium sized drinks of your choice. One medium sized popcorn._  
店员指向菜单。就在那里，用粗体字印在一个板块上。情侣套餐。两杯中号自选饮料。一份中号爆米花。

_Why hadn't I seen that before?_ Feeling a little dizzy, Shinji had to clench his teeth and take a deep breath. _What's wrong with saving money? And what's wrong with getting a couple's set? I've already hugged her several times. One time she was even naked. No need to get so worked up over a stupid popcorn._  
为什么我之前没注意到这个？感到有些晕眩，真嗣不得不咬紧牙关，深吸一口气。省钱有什么错？买个情侣套餐又有什么错？我已经抱过她好几次了。有一次她甚至没穿衣服。没必要为了一桶愚蠢的爆米花这么紧张。

Shinji glanced back at Asuka, hoping she would offer some kind of help, or command he could follow, or something, anything, to make his decision easier. But she was staring intently at the movie pamphlet in her hand, as if she wasn't listening to the conversation going on right next to her. She must have felt his gaze too, but she ignored it.  
真嗣回头瞥了一眼明日香，希望她能提供一些帮助，或者下达一个他能遵循的命令，或者任何事情，任何能让他的决定更容易的事情。但她正专注地盯着手中电影的小册子，仿佛没有在听旁边正在进行的对话。她肯定也感觉到了他的目光，但她选择了无视。

Forcing back a groan, Shinji cleared his throat a few times and opened his mouth.  
真嗣强忍住呻吟，清了清喉咙几次，然后张开了嘴。

"Cou, couple's set, then."  
“那，那就情侣套餐吧。”

A few moments later, when the order was brought out, Asuka folded the pamphlet, grabbed the popcorn bucket and her own cup, and headed for the theater, which had just opened. Shinji quickly picked up his cup and followed. Asuka didn't even turn her head in Shinji's direction, just continued at a brisk pace. Every time she took a step a kernel or two escaped from the bucket, but she didn't seem to care. Shinji's throat dried up as he realized that he had finally made a mistake and ruined their date. Even more frustrating was the fact he couldn't fathom the reason it was even a mistake in the first place. Was she angry because he bought a couple's set without her permission, or was she angry because he hesitated to buy it?  
片刻后，当订单送来时，明日香折起宣传册，抓起爆米花桶和自己的杯子，朝刚刚开放的影院走去。真嗣迅速拿起自己的杯子跟了上去。明日香甚至没有回头看真嗣一眼，只是继续快步前行。每走一步，就有一两颗爆米花从桶里掉出来，但她似乎并不在意。真嗣意识到自己终于犯了个错误，毁了他们的约会，喉咙不禁发干。更让他沮丧的是，他无法理解为什么这会是个错误。是因为他未经允许就买了情侣套餐，还是因为他犹豫不决才惹她生气？

Shinji caught up with her at the entrance. His mouth was dry as sand by then. "Asuka, what's wrong?"  
真嗣在入口处追上了她。那时他的嘴巴干得像沙子一样。“明日香，怎么了？”

Asuka didn't even turn her head towards him. "What was all the fuss about?" she mumbled. It was a vague statement that could be interpreted any number of ways. The only things that Shinji could see from his angle were her slightly flushed cheeks.  
明日香甚至没有转头看他。“有什么好大惊小怪的？”她咕哝道。这句话含糊其辞，可以有多种解释。真嗣从他的角度只能看到她微微泛红的脸颊。

Shinji followed Asuka as she wordlessly made her way to their seats, his heart freezing in his chest. She had to be angry. Angry enough to make her face red. And he couldn't quite figure out why. It felt like he got thrown back to last week.  
真嗣跟着明日香，她一言不发地走向他们的座位，他的心在胸口冻结。她一定很生气。气到脸都红了。而他却不太明白为什么。感觉像是回到了上周。

As the seats around them filled up one by one and the previews started playing, neither Asuka nor Shinji said anything. The only sound was Asuka picking up popcorn from the bucket on her lap and chewing quietly. Then the lights dimmed and the movie started, rendering it impossible to talk even if they wanted to. Regret gripped Shinji. He wished he had apologized when he still had the chance.  
随着周围座位一个接一个被填满，预告片开始播放，明日香和真嗣都没有说话。唯一的声音是明日香从她腿上的爆米花桶里捡起爆米花，安静地咀嚼。然后灯光暗了下来，电影开始了，即使他们想说话也不可能了。真嗣感到后悔。他希望自己能在还有机会的时候道歉。

Asuka didn't seem to care about things like theater etiquette, though. "You're not going to eat?" she asked.  
不过，明日香似乎并不在乎什么剧院礼仪。"你不打算吃吗？"她问道。

Shinji's shoulders jerked in surprise. He glanced in Asuka's direction.  
真嗣的肩膀因惊讶而猛地一颤。他瞥向明日香的方向。

"What?" he whispered. “什么？”他低声问道。

"I asked you why you're not eating any popcorn. You almost skipped dinner too." Asuka barely lowered her voice. A cough came from the seats behind them, and Shinji was almost certain it wasn't an accident. Shinji wasn't in the mood to reach for Asuka right now, but he figured he might as well acquiesce if that was what it took to shut her up. So he grabbed a handful of popcorn and popped it into his mouth.  
“我问你为什么不吃爆米花。你差点连晚饭都跳过了。”明日香几乎压低了声音。他们座位后面传来一声咳嗽，真嗣几乎可以肯定那不是偶然。真嗣现在没心情去迎合明日香，但他觉得如果这样能让她闭嘴，那也不妨顺从。于是他抓起一把爆米花塞进嘴里。

Minutes passed like that. Shinji realized that he was quite hungry after all, so he continued to munch on popcorn and concentrate on the movie.  
时间就这样一分一秒地过去。真嗣意识到自己其实相当饿，于是继续嚼着爆米花，专心看电影。

It was around the time the male and female protagonists first met when Asuka made a scene again. Shinji's hand was buried in the popcorn bucket, which was still in Asuka's lap. He wasn't paying much attention to it. Quick as a snake, Asuka's hand dove in and grabbed his.  
大约在男女主角初次相遇的时候，明日香又闹了起来。真嗣的手埋在爆米花桶里，那桶还在明日香的腿上。他并没有太在意。明日香的手如蛇般迅速伸入，一把抓住了他的手。

"Asuka, what are you doing?" Shinji asked angrily, voice raised to the uppermost limit of what could still be considered a whisper.  
“明日香，你在干什么？”真嗣生气地问道，声音提高到了勉强还能算是耳语的极限。

Asuka loosened her grip on Shinji's fingers amidst the popcorn, but didn't remove her hand entirely. Her face was expressionless as she stared at the screen like she was completely innocent. Shinji snorted slightly, grabbed a few kernels of popcorn and brought them to his mouth.  
在爆米花中，明日香松开了紧握着真嗣手指的手，但没有完全移开。她面无表情地盯着屏幕，仿佛完全无辜。真嗣轻声哼了一下，抓起几颗爆米花送进嘴里。

Next time, Shinji was ready. He quickly dodged Asuka's hand when it stabbed in the direction of his, pretending to pick up her own popcorn. There was a loud clatter as the fleeing and pursuing hands furiously plowed through the bucket, knocking an absurd amount of popcorn onto the floor. There was a cough from the row behind them once again. Shinji quickly grabbed as much popcorn as he could between his index finger and thumb and yanked his hand out. Glancing in Asuka's direction, he saw that her eyes were still glued to the screen, but the corner of her mouth had stretched a good distance towards her earlobe.  
下一次，真嗣准备好了。当明日香的手朝他的方向猛刺过来时，他迅速躲开，假装在捡自己的爆米花。追逐和逃跑的手在桶里激烈地翻腾，发出巨大的声响，大量爆米花被撞得散落一地。后排再次传来一声咳嗽。真嗣迅速用食指和拇指尽可能多地抓起爆米花，猛地抽出手。他瞥向明日香，发现她的目光仍紧锁屏幕，但嘴角已明显上扬至耳边。

He could have just given up on the popcorn and not humored Asuka anymore, but he wasn't about to do that. Hunger was one thing, but this was personal now. His pride was on the line. Shinji's hand lifted slightly, poised to strike, and tension crackled between them as Asuka glanced sideways in Shinji's direction.  
他本可以放弃爆米花，不再逗弄明日香，但他绝不会这么做。饥饿是一回事，但现在这关乎个人尊严。他的自尊心岌岌可危。真嗣的手微微抬起，准备出击，紧张的气氛在他们之间一触即发，明日香斜眼瞥向真嗣的方向。

With a swift, decisive jab only comparable to one he would do to an Angel's core, Shinji struck. It was so fast that Asuka didn't even have time to react before Shinji's hand was out of the bucket, clutching a whole fistful of popcorn. Shinji wanted to throw his head back and let out a triumphant roar. There was no one on this planet who could stop him from eating this goddamn popcorn. Heh. Which pilot had the better coordination _now?_  
真嗣以迅雷不及掩耳之势，果断一击，动作之快堪比对付使徒核心时的精准。明日香甚至来不及反应，真嗣的手已经从桶里抽出，紧紧抓满了一把爆米花。真嗣真想仰头长啸，发出胜利的咆哮。这世上没人能阻止他享用这该死的爆米花。呵呵。现在谁才是协调性更好的驾驶员？

And then Asuka slapped Shinji's wrist as it passed over the armrest between them. With a loud snap, his hand opened and all the popcorn in his hand spilled out onto the floor. Shinji yelped, shocked. Asuka giggled hysterically.  
就在这时，明日香一巴掌拍在真嗣越过扶手的手腕上。随着一声脆响，他的手张开，手中的爆米花全部洒落在地板上。真嗣惊叫一声，震惊不已。明日香则歇斯底里地咯咯笑了起来。

"Can you lovebirds shut up for just _one_ hour, please?!"  
"你们这对小情侣能不能安静一个小时，拜托了？！"

Shinji gritted his teeth and glared at Asuka. Asuka ignored him entirely, her shoulders shaking. She clamped her hand over her mouth, but that did little to muffle her giggles. At the sight, Shinji's anger instantly evaporated and he couldn't help smiling back, even though his skin was still crawling with embarrassment.  
真嗣咬紧牙关，瞪着明日香。明日香完全无视他，肩膀颤抖着。她用手捂住嘴，但这几乎没能抑制住她的笑声。看到这一幕，真嗣的怒气瞬间消散，尽管脸上还残留着尴尬的红晕，他也不禁笑了起来。

Shinji twisted his body towards the row behind him. "I'm sorry," he mumbled, hoping his apology was loud enough to be heard above the movie.  
真嗣扭身转向后排。“对不起，”他咕哝道，希望自己的道歉声能盖过电影的音量。

Shinji's heart pounded. He couldn't concentrate. All his life, Shinji had hated couples who made a scene in public. The fact that he had just become half of one of them made him shudder. However, in the back of his mind, in a teensy corner he refused to acknowledge out of stubborn pride, he thought that he now understood why those stupid couples he had seen had acted that way in the first place.  
真嗣的心怦怦直跳。他无法集中注意力。他一生中都讨厌那些在公共场合大秀恩爱的情侣。而自己刚刚成为其中一员的事实让他不寒而栗。然而，在他内心深处，一个他出于顽固的自尊而拒绝承认的小角落里，他开始理解那些他曾见过的愚蠢情侣为何会那样行事。

Peace returned for a while, as Shinji gave up on the popcorn and Asuka didn't pull any other pranks. Thinking that he could now concentrate on the movie, he quickly realized that he didn't understand anything happening on the screen. He had missed the entire introduction. All because of Asuka.  
和平暂时回归，真嗣放弃了爆米花，而明日香也没有再搞恶作剧。他以为自己现在可以专心看电影了，却很快意识到自己根本看不懂屏幕上发生的事情。他错过了整个开场。全都是因为明日香。

And Asuka still had no intention of leaving Shinji alone, it seemed. It must have been about ten minutes before he heard a creaking sound. She was lifting up the armrest between them. Before Shinji could say anything she scooted closer and leaned up against him. The faint vanilla scent that had been coming from her all day invaded Shinji's nostrils. "Aren't you hungry?" This time she kept her voice low, just a little.  
而明日香似乎仍无意让真嗣独处。大约十分钟后，他听到了一阵吱吱声。她正在抬起他们之间的扶手。真嗣还没来得及说什么，她就挪近了一些，靠在他身上。她一整天散发出的淡淡香草味侵入了真嗣的鼻腔。“你不饿吗？”这次她压低了声音，只是轻轻地问。

Shinji let out a small groan at the sheer brazenness of it. "Yeah, but _someone_ won't let me eat in peace."  
真嗣对此露骨的厚脸皮发出了一声小小的呻吟。“是啊，但有人不让我安静地吃饭。”

Asuka let out a small snort and returned to her seat. Shinji heard rustling from the popcorn bucket. The next moment, Asuka's hand was thrust into his face. On her outstretched palm lay a handful of popcorn.  
明日香轻哼一声，回到自己的座位上。真嗣听到爆米花桶里传来窸窸窣窣的声音。下一刻，明日香的手就伸到了他面前。她摊开的手掌上放着一把爆米花。

Shinji was baffled at first, unable to make sense of it, and then doubly baffled when he realized her intention. _Really?_  
真嗣起初感到困惑，无法理解她的举动，随后意识到她的意图时更加困惑了。真的吗？

Shinji clenched his teeth. "Asuka... I'm not a dog."  
真嗣咬紧牙关。“明日香...我又不是狗。”

Asuka waved her hand slightly and whispered. "Yeah, you're my boyfriend. What's so bad about letting your girlfriend feed you something?"  
明日香轻轻挥了挥手，低声说道。“是啊，你是我的男朋友。让女朋友喂你吃点东西有什么不好的？”

That was below the belt. Shinji found himself contending with a curious combination of butterflies in his stomach at being called her _boyfriend_ and the overwhelming urge to rip his hair out.  
这话太伤人了。真嗣发现自己内心既因被称作她的男朋友而感到一阵莫名的悸动，又有着一股难以抑制的抓狂冲动。

"Well, um, nothing really..."  
“嗯，呃，没什么特别的……”

"Or, what, do you think my hands are that dirty? Is that why you never tried to hold one all day?"  
“还是说，你觉得我的手很脏吗？所以你一整天都没想过要握一下？”

Shinji's head was spinning. He was so caught up in the veracity of that specific detail (which was shocking if true) that it hadn't occurred to him that Asuka's logic was fundamentally flawed. With a small sigh, Shinji began to mentally justify to himself the humiliation he was about to suffer. _I'm doing this only because I'm hungry._  
真嗣的脑袋一片混乱。他被那个具体细节的真实性（如果属实的话，确实令人震惊）完全吸引住了，以至于没有意识到明日香的逻辑从根本上是有缺陷的。轻轻叹了口气，真嗣开始在心里为自己即将遭受的羞辱找借口。我只是因为饿了才这么做的。

Eating something that was on top of someone's palm without touching any part of it with your mouth was incredibly difficult. Especially if it was a small thing, like popcorn. After a ridiculously long time, Shinji finally finished the offered popcorn, and Asuka's hand quickly went back. Just as Shinji was about to let out a sigh of relief, there was a rustling sound, and a fistful of popcorn reappeared in front of his mouth.  
从某人手掌上吃东西而不触碰到任何部分，这极其困难。尤其是像爆米花这样的小东西。经过一段荒谬的长时间后，真嗣终于吃完了递来的爆米花，明日香的手迅速收回。就在真嗣正要松一口气时，一阵沙沙声响起，又一撮爆米花重新出现在他嘴前。

Unable to refuse, Shinji ate them all, and was promptly served some more. It was a nerve-wrecking and exhausting process, and Shinji could barely watch the movie. He briefly entertained the idea of slobbering all over her hand as revenge, but decided not to, in fear of getting slapped with a withering combination of grease, salt, and his own spit. Despite his best efforts, Shinji was sure he had smeared some saliva on Asuka's hand at some point. He couldn't be sure, though, because Asuka didn't show any reaction.  
无法拒绝，真嗣把它们全吃了，随即又被递来更多。这是一个令人神经紧绷且疲惫的过程，真嗣几乎无法专心看电影。他短暂地想过用口水涂满她的手作为报复，但最终决定不这么做，害怕被一记狠辣的耳光，混合着油脂、盐分和他自己的唾液。尽管他尽力了，真嗣确信自己在某个时刻弄了些口水在明日香手上。不过，他无法确定，因为明日香没有任何反应。

When the popcorn finally ran out, the movie was also over. Eating popcorn had never been so difficult. Shinji felt almost sick. Trying to ignore the angry stares from the other theatergoers, Shinji followed Asuka out the door. They both went to the restroom, but Asuka took almost ten minutes longer than he did. Only after Shinji started to worry that something went wrong did Asuka show up, and they left the theater together.  
当爆米花终于吃完时，电影也结束了。吃爆米花从未如此艰难。真嗣几乎感到恶心。他试图无视其他观众愤怒的目光，跟着明日香走出影院。两人都去了洗手间，但明日香比他多花了近十分钟。直到真嗣开始担心出了什么问题，明日香才出现，他们一起离开了影院。

Now that they were about to go home, Asuka seemed to be in a pretty good mood. Whatever was bothering her at the box office must have gotten resolved by her antics during the movie. Shinji felt a huge sense of relief.  
现在他们即将回家，明日香似乎心情很好。在售票处困扰她的事情，一定是在电影期间她的举动中得到了解决。真嗣感到巨大的宽慰。

As soon as they stepped out of the theater, the bus arrived serendipitously, before they had a chance to have a talk or anything. They hopped on.  
他们一走出影院，公交车就恰巧在他们有机会交谈或做其他事情之前到达了。他们跳上了车。

The neighborhood they were living in was one of those residential areas for which the demand was totally miscalculated. Built during the early development boom of Tokyo-3, there weren't many people living there now after the population exodus that happened after the start of the War. For example, Misato, Asuka, and Shinji were the only residents in their apartment building. So there were very few passengers heading in that direction, and by the time the bus was halfway across the city, Shinji and Asuka were the only ones left on board.  
他们居住的街区是那种需求被严重误判的住宅区。在东京-3 早期开发热潮中建成，战争爆发后人口外流，如今居住的人并不多。比如，美里、明日香和真嗣是公寓楼里仅有的居民。因此，前往那个方向的乘客非常少，当公交车穿越城市半程时，真嗣和明日香成了车上仅剩的乘客。

As they sat side by side like that, Asuka remained silent. She sat quietly with her eyes open, as if lost in thought about something.  
他们那样并肩坐着，明日香保持沉默。她静静地睁着眼睛，仿佛陷入了沉思。

Shinji felt a chill. 真嗣感到一阵寒意。

Adults called Shinji's generation the "eternal summer kids", the ones who had never known real cold. He didn't think that was totally fair. The nights were cooler than the days, and he very much felt the cold when he was sitting in an air conditioned room for too long in short sleeves. Just like he was now. And if he could feel the chill in his short-sleeved t-shirt, he wondered how Asuka was feeling in a dress that bared her shoulders and arms.  
大人们称真嗣这一代为“永恒夏日的孩子”，那些从未真正经历过严寒的人。他觉得这并不完全公平。夜晚比白天凉爽，当他长时间穿着短袖坐在空调房里时，他确实能感受到寒冷。就像现在这样。如果他能感觉到短袖 T 恤的寒意，他不禁好奇穿着露肩露臂连衣裙的明日香会有何感受。

Shinji wondered if he was supposed to do something here, if there was something that was expected of him. It's not like he had a coat to take off and wrap around her shoulders. In the movie they watched today, the hero did that for the heroine, but the movie was set during the winter, in a world where Second Impact didn't happen.  
真嗣不知道自己是否应该在这里做些什么，是否有什么事情是他应该做的。他并没有外套可以脱下来披在她肩上。今天看的电影中，男主角为女主角做了这件事，但电影设定在冬季，一个第二次冲击未曾发生的世界。

_Maybe I could put my arm around her shoulder._ Shinji's arm twitched. But that was it. He couldn't bring himself to do it. He couldn't turn his thoughts into actions. Not yet.  
也许我可以把手臂搭在她的肩膀上。真嗣的手臂微微抽动。但仅此而已。他无法让自己付诸行动。他无法将想法转化为行动。至少现在还不能。

And then Shinji began to be aware of his own smell. The sour smell that was typical of new clothes, with the sweat of the day subtly mixed in. He found himself comparing it to Asuka's soft vanilla scent, and wondered if he should have sprayed something on himself, even if he couldn't do anything about the smell of his clothes.  
随后，真嗣开始意识到自己的气味。那种新衣服特有的酸味，夹杂着一天的汗水，微妙地混合在一起。他发现自己不由得将其与明日香柔和的香草气息相比较，心想自己是否应该喷点什么，尽管他无法改变衣服的气味。

But that would be too much like copying Mr. Kaji. Shinji thought of the handsome man he'd seen occasionally in NERV. He had something with Ms. Misato, and Asuka also chased after him like crazy. He swallowed, suddenly feeling sick to his stomach.  
但那样做未免太像在模仿加持先生了。真嗣想起了偶尔在 NERV 见到的那个英俊男人。他和美里小姐有些瓜葛，明日香也疯狂地追求着他。他咽了咽口水，突然感到一阵恶心。

Shinji shook his head slightly, trying to refocus his attention back to the present. Asuka was still sitting quietly, looking straight ahead with a neutral expression on her face. It was unusual for her to be this quiet, but she'd had a long day after all, going straight from class to a date with him. That's how Shinji had interpreted it, though it was getting harder and harder to continue to do so. The thing that lived in the shadowy parts of his mind started to gnaw at him, wondering if maybe it was somehow his fault. He hated that feeling. He racked his brains combing through the events of the past day, trying to figure out where he went wrong. The theater? Or maybe even back at -  
真嗣轻轻摇了摇头，试图将注意力重新集中到当下。明日香依旧静静地坐着，面无表情地直视前方。她这样安静实属罕见，但毕竟她今天从课堂直接赶来与他约会，确实经历了一整天。尽管如此，真嗣越来越难以继续这样理解。他内心深处的阴影开始啃噬着他，怀疑是否这一切都是他的错。他痛恨这种感觉。他绞尽脑汁回顾过去一天的事件，试图找出自己哪里做错了。是在电影院吗？还是更早之前——

"What are you looking at?"  
"你在看什么？"

At the sound of Asuka's voice, Shinji blinked. Asuka had turned her head to look at him. Something like a smile hung on her lips.  
听到明日香的声音，真嗣眨了眨眼。明日香转过头来看着他，唇边挂着一丝似笑非笑的表情。

Shinji forced one in return. "I was just wondering if you were tired."  
真嗣勉强回以一笑。"我只是在想你是不是累了。"

"Not really." Asuka shook her head slightly and looked forward again.  
“并不算。”明日香轻轻摇了摇头，再次望向前方。

Silence fell again. The bus passed by a stop. There was no one waiting there, and no one to get off. For a while, the only sound was the vibration of the engine.  
沉默再次降临。公交车经过一个站点，那里没有人等候，也没有人下车。一时间，唯一的声音只有引擎的震动。

Once again, it was Asuka who broke the silence. "I was just thinking about the movie."  
又是明日香打破了沉默。“我刚才在想那部电影。”

_I can't remember a single thing about it, yet you managed to remember it even while doing all that._ Shinji felt something like pure awe, though he didn't say it out loud.  
我一点儿也记不得了，而你却在做那些事的同时还能记得。真嗣感到一种纯粹的敬畏，尽管他没有大声说出来。

"What were you thinking?" he asked instead.  
“你在想什么？”他改问道。

"I didn't like the main characters."  
“我不喜欢主角们。”

Shinji had to take a moment to recall what he did know of the movie. Both the male and female protagonists were such overused romantic comedy clichés that there was nothing unusual about them. There wasn't much to like or dislike about them.  
真嗣不得不花点时间回想他对这部电影的了解。男女主角都是那种被过度使用的浪漫喜剧陈词滥调，他们身上没有任何特别之处。对他们的喜欢或不喜欢都无从谈起。

"Why not?" "为什么不行？"

Asuka's mouth curled up. "You have a lot of questions today."  
明日香的嘴角上扬。"你今天问题真多。"

_What does that even mean?_ He had no answer for that, so he kept his mouth shut. Luckily, Asuka didn't seem to expect one and continued on her own.  
那到底是什么意思？他对此毫无头绪，所以选择了保持沉默。幸运的是，明日香似乎并不期待他的回答，而是继续自顾自地说下去。

"It happens so often in movies, novels, and mangas. I feel like I'm weird for saying it. Apparently girls all like it. I don't understand why male leads who act like that are romanticized so much. In real life, they'd be considered stalkers. Obsessive, controlling. It's not cute at all when you think about it, but the heroines are totally okay with it."  
"这在电影、小说和漫画中太常见了。我说出来感觉自己很奇怪。显然所有女孩都喜欢这样。我不明白为什么那样行为的男主角会被浪漫化。在现实生活中，他们会被认为是跟踪狂。偏执、控制欲强。仔细想想一点也不可爱，但女主角们却完全没问题。"

_It's just a romance genre archetype_. Shinji thought. _No need to think that deeply about it_. Being smart seemed to have its downsides, too.  
这只是浪漫类型的一个原型罢了。真嗣想。没必要想得那么深。聪明似乎也有它的缺点。

Silence descended again as Shinji struggled to find an appropriate response, and it was, again, Asuka who filled the void. "I guess everyone's just lonely. Heroines. Heroes. The people who watch them. Everyone."  
沉默再次降临，真嗣努力寻找合适的回应，又是明日香填补了空白。“我想大家只是孤独。女主角们。英雄们。观看他们的人。每个人都是。”

As he pondered her words, something heavy pressed down on Shinji's shoulder. Wincing, he turned around to find Asuka's head pushed against it.  
在他沉思她的话语时，某种沉重的东西压在了真嗣的肩上。他皱着眉转过身，发现明日香的头靠在了上面。

"Asuka...?" “明日香……？”

"What I said earlier. About not being tired." Asuka muttered softly. "I take it back. I'm tired. I'm going to sleep. Wake me up when we get home."  
“我之前说的。关于不累的话。”明日香轻声嘟囔着。“我收回。我累了。我要睡了。到家时叫醒我。”

"O-Okay." "好-好吧。"

Asuka closed her eyes without answering. Shinji cleared his throat, trying to relax his stiffened body.  
明日香没有回答，闭上了眼睛。真嗣清了清喉咙，试图放松自己僵硬的身体。

The hectic day was coming to an end, and as he sat on the quiet bus with nothing but the warmth on his shoulder as his companion, Shinji finally felt the weight of the day's events. He had indeed gone on a date with a girl. It had ended without major incident, and now they were going home, and his girlfriend was sleeping on his shoulder. And this girlfriend was not just a normal girl, it was Asuka. He couldn't have imagined this happening a few days ago. He was almost starting to hate her. Shinji wondered if Asuka felt the same things he was feeling now. And if so, how could she act so casually?  
忙碌的一天即将结束，当他坐在安静的公交车上，只有肩上的温暖陪伴着他时，真嗣终于感受到了这一天事件的重压。他的确和一个女孩约会了。没有发生什么大事故，现在他们正回家，他的女朋友正靠在他的肩上睡着了。而这个女朋友不是普通的女孩，她是明日香。几天前，他几乎无法想象这样的事情会发生。他甚至开始讨厌她了。真嗣想知道明日香是否也感受到了他现在的感受。如果是的话，她怎么能表现得如此随意呢？

The bus shook slightly as it went over a speed bump. It wasn't huge, but it was enough to shake Shinji out of his thoughts, and Asuka out of her light sleep.  
公交车在经过一个减速带时轻微摇晃。虽然幅度不大，但足以让真嗣从沉思中惊醒，也让明日香从浅睡中醒来。

"What are you doing, idiot?"  
“你在干什么，白痴？”

The thought crossed Shinji's mind that this girl was a genius at making him dumbfounded. "Uh...sitting? It's not like I'm driving..."  
真嗣心中闪过一个念头，这个女孩真是让他哑口无言的天才。“呃……坐着？我又不是在开车……”

"You should stabilize me."  
“你应该稳定我。”

_Stabilize_. That was so like a pilot, he thought for a moment. His next thought was, how? What the hell was she asking for?  
稳定。这想法太像飞行员了，他一时这么想。紧接着，他疑惑起来，怎么稳定？她到底在要求什么？

It wasn't until Asuka shifted her shoulder on the opposite side that Shinji realized her intention. Almost feeling dazed, Shinji straightened up. Telling himself that he had already done something more physical than this, that it wasn't a big deal, he slowly put his arm around Asuka's shoulder.  
直到明日香换了个肩膀靠向另一边，真嗣才明白她的意图。他几乎有些晕乎乎地挺直了身子。告诉自己这比之前做的那些体力活轻松多了，没什么大不了的，他缓缓地将手臂搭在明日香的肩上。

Asuka's bare shoulder was cold against his hand. Her skin was very soft. She let out a small humming sound and pressed herself against him. They shifted slightly, adjusting their positions, until they found a comfortable angle.  
明日香裸露的肩膀在他手中感到冰凉。她的肌肤非常柔软。她发出一声轻轻的哼鸣，紧贴着他。他们微微挪动，调整着姿势，直到找到一个舒适的夹角。

Or, the most comfortable angle possible. Compared to what Shinji had fantasized about this specific act, it was rather uncomfortable. His arm was already starting to cramp.  
或者说，这是最舒适的姿势了。与真嗣对这个特定行为的幻想相比，这其实相当不舒服。他的手臂已经开始抽筋了。

_Maybe it's my size that's the problem_. Shinji thought with a growing sense of self-loathing. The girl sleeping on his shoulder right now was a little bit taller than him, after all.  
也许问题出在我的身高上。真嗣带着越来越强烈的自我厌恶想道。毕竟，此刻靠在他肩上睡觉的女孩比他还要稍高一些。

It didn't seem to matter to Asuka. Soon her breathing became slow. It was barely audible, drowned out by the noise of the engine, but this close to her, Shinji could feel her chest rising and falling. She must have fallen asleep quickly.  
这对明日香似乎无关紧要。很快，她的呼吸变得缓慢。那声音几乎听不见，被引擎的噪音淹没，但如此靠近她的身体，真嗣能感觉到她的胸膛起伏。她一定很快就睡着了。

Tokyo-3 was not a huge place, and Misato's apartment and the movie theater weren't exactly located at the far end of the city, which meant that by the time Asuka leaned into Shinji, they were already pretty close to their destination. It hadn't been long after Asuka had fallen asleep that Shinji had begun to worry about how to wake her up gently. He couldn't think of a good way to do it.  
第三新东京市并不大，美里小姐的公寓和电影院也并非位于城市的尽头，这意味着当明日香靠向真嗣时，他们已经离目的地相当近了。在明日香入睡后不久，真嗣就开始担心如何温柔地唤醒她。他想不出一个好办法。

Luckily, Asuka solved the problem herself. When the announcement rang from the speaker that their apartment was two stops away, Asuka sat up and straightened her dress and hair.  
幸运的是，明日香自己解决了这个问题。当广播从扬声器中响起，告知他们的公寓还有两站时，明日香坐起身来，整理了她的裙子和头发。

"Let's get off, Shinji." "我们下车吧，真嗣。"

"But we're still two stops-"  
"但我们还有两站才到——"

"I want to take a walk."  
"我想散散步。"

As was almost always the case, her tone brooked no argument. Shinji picked up the shopping bag and stood up.  
几乎总是如此，她的语气不容反驳。真嗣拿起购物袋，站了起来。

As soon as she stepped off the bus, Asuka took a quick look around and started walking at a brisk pace. Shinji hurried after her. Asuka didn't look back at him, and Shinji began to worry that she was angry again. Because if she was, he really couldn't imagine why.  
一下公交车，明日香迅速环顾四周，便快步走开。真嗣紧随其后。明日香没有回头看他，真嗣开始担心她是不是又生气了。因为如果她真的生气了，他实在想不出原因。

Only after Asuka turned and smiled slightly as they stopped in front of a small convenience store did Shinji feel relieved.  
直到明日香停在一间小便利店前，转过身微微一笑，真嗣才松了口气。

"Wait here. It won't take long." With that, Asuka walked inside without even acknowledging Shinji's nod.  
"在这里等着。不会太久的。" 说完，明日香径直走了进去，甚至没有回应真嗣的点头。

Standing alone in the quiet suburbs of Tokyo-3, with no cars or people, Asuka's words about him not holding hands with her came back to him. He realized he forgot to hold Asuka's hand after getting off the bus.  
独自站在东京-3 郊区的静谧中，四周没有车辆也没有行人，明日香关于他不牵手的那些话再次浮现在他脑海。他意识到自己下了公交车后忘记了牵明日香的手。

Shinji was honestly not sure about this. As far as he knew, people in relationships didn't hold hands everywhere all the time. But he did know that going out on a date and not holding hands once was probably not good either. He didn't avoid doing so on purpose, he just wasn't used to this kind of situation yet. He hoped he didn't hurt Asuka's feelings.  
真嗣对此确实不太确定。据他所知，恋爱中的人并不会随时随地都牵手。但他也明白，约会时不牵手一次可能也不太好。他并非有意回避，只是还不习惯这种情境。他希望自己没有伤害到明日香的感情。

Shinji squinted. Asuka emerged from the convenience store with something in her hand and held it out to him. It was shining silver under the dim streetlight. It took a moment to realize that it was gum wrapped in a foil wrapper. Asuka was already chewing her own. Her lips glittered too.  
真嗣眯起了眼睛。明日香从便利店出来，手里拿着什么东西递给他。在昏暗的路灯下，那东西闪着银光。过了一会儿他才意识到那是用锡箔纸包着的口香糖。明日香已经在嚼自己的那份了。她的嘴唇也闪着光。

Shinji hated gum; he didn't even like to chew it. He had long been of the opinion that it was a source of nasty public litter and needed to be completely eliminated from society.  
真嗣讨厌口香糖；他甚至不喜欢嚼它。他一直认为口香糖是造成公共场所垃圾的罪魁祸首，应该从社会中彻底消除。

"I don't like gum." “我不喜欢口香糖。”

Asuka shook the gum slightly. "So? I want you to chew it anyway."  
明日香轻轻摇了摇口香糖。“所以呢？我就是要你嚼它。”

With a small groan, Shinji accepted the gum and popped it into his mouth.  
带着一丝无奈的呻吟，真嗣接过口香糖，塞进了嘴里。

The taste of mint exploded in his mouth. It was much too strong. Shinji grimaced. Asuka smirked and jerked her head to one side of the road, then frowned and looked back the other way. Shinji cleared his throat and pointed in the direction Asuka had first turned.  
薄荷的味道在他口中爆发，过于强烈。真嗣皱了皱眉。明日香得意地笑了笑，向路的一侧甩了甩头，随即又皱起眉头看向另一边。真嗣清了清嗓子，指向明日香最初转头的方向。

"Home is that way." “家在那边。”

Shinji's attitude must not have sat well with Asuka, for she frowned for a moment, but she eventually shrugged and started walking in the direction he'd pointed. Shinji quickly moved to her side and walked alongside her, this time reaching out and taking her hand.  
真嗣的态度似乎让明日香不太高兴，她皱了皱眉，但最终还是耸了耸肩，朝着他指的方向走去。真嗣迅速走到她身边，与她并肩而行，这次伸出手握住了她的手。

Asuka didn't say a word, just squeezed his hand. It was a little too hard, making his hand throb, but it only softened Shinji's heart.  
明日香一言不发，只是紧紧握住他的手。力道稍大，让他的手有些疼痛，但这反而让真嗣的心软了下来。

They walked together beneath the glow of the streetlights. It was quiet save for the sound of grasshoppers. The slightly humid, cool night air tickled their noses. As they walked past closed shops and empty residential neighborhoods, they didn't encounter anyone. There was only Shinji, Asuka, and the warmth of their clasped hands.  
他们在路灯的柔和光芒下并肩而行。四周静悄悄的，只有蚱蜢的鸣叫声。微湿而凉爽的夜风轻拂着他们的鼻尖。穿过关闭的店铺和空无一人的住宅区，他们没有遇到任何人。只有真嗣、明日香，以及他们紧握的手中的温暖。

He realized that this was much better than the crowded places they walked around during the day. There were no stares. No noise. Shinji felt something uncoil in his chest. He wondered what Asuka was doing, so he turned to look in her direction. She was already looking at him sideways. She had a soft smile on her face, one that he had seen more and more often lately.  
他意识到这比白天他们逛过的拥挤地方要好得多。没有注视，没有喧嚣。真嗣感到胸中有什么东西在舒展。他好奇明日香在做什么，于是转头看向她。她已经斜眼看着他了。她的脸上带着温柔的微笑，这是他最近越来越常见的表情。

"You seem to be in a good mood, Idiot Shinji."  
“你看起来心情不错，笨蛋真嗣。”

Shinji blushed. _Am I that obvious?_  
真嗣脸红了。我有那么明显吗？

"Yeah. I…" He paused for a moment. He felt like what he was about to say was unnecessary. Then Shinji decided to be honest.  
"是啊。我…" 他顿了一下。他觉得接下来要说的话似乎是多余的。然后真嗣决定坦诚相待。

"I feel good. This was my first date ever and it was nice. I'm sure you're used to all this but I'm-"  
"我感觉很好。这是我第一次约会，感觉很棒。我肯定你已经习惯了这些，但我——"

Shinji was smiling shyly while lifting the hand holding the shopping bag to scratch the back of his head when Asuka's steps had come to a screeching halt. Regret instantly washed over him. He wished he hadn't said anything. Asuka's face was hard. Shinji wondered if he should apologize right now. In the past, he would have reflexively apologized to dispel the tension, but that strategy had backfired enough times with Asuka to the point that he couldn't bring himself to do it. Shinji had no intention of ruining Asuka's mood any further.  
真嗣微笑着有些害羞地举起拿着购物袋的手挠了挠后脑勺，这时明日香的脚步突然猛地停了下来。后悔立刻涌上他的心头。他真希望自己什么都没说。明日香的脸色冷硬。真嗣不知道自己是否应该立刻道歉。以前，他会本能地道歉以缓解紧张气氛，但这种策略在明日香身上失败了太多次，以至于他无法再这样做。真嗣无意进一步破坏明日香的心情。

"Asuka...?" “明日香……？”

"It's my first time too," she said in a calm voice, looking straight ahead. While Shinji wondered what to make of this, Asuka continued.  
“这也是我第一次。”她平静地说道，目光直视前方。真嗣还在琢磨这话的意思，明日香继续说道。

"I've actually done this kind of thing a lot with Mr. Kaji. We never did it all in one day, but still. Shopping together. Walking around in the afternoon. Going to dinner. Even a movie once. I called it a date, and he never bothered to correct me, but I've never…"  
"我其实和加持先生做过很多类似的事情。我们从未在一天之内全部完成，但依然。一起购物。下午闲逛。去吃晚餐。甚至有一次还看了电影。我称之为约会，而他从未纠正过我，但我从未……"

Shinji's heart sank as he watched Asuka's face contort. He couldn't even guess why Asuka was so upset, which only added to his frustration. Maybe it was because she was realizing that he was nowhere near as good a date as Mr. Kaji. Her hand slipped from Shinji's, and he felt as if his soul was slipping out of his body at the same time. Turning her head to the roadside flowerbed, Asuka spat out the gum she had been chewing like it was a venomous toxin and began to walk briskly onward.  
看着明日香的脸扭曲，真嗣的心沉了下去。他甚至猜不出明日香为何如此沮丧，这让他更加沮丧。也许是因为她意识到他远不如加持先生那样适合约会。她的手从真嗣的手中滑落，他感觉自己的灵魂仿佛也在同时从身体中溜走。明日香转头看向路边的花坛，吐出了她一直在嚼的口香糖，仿佛那是一种有毒的毒素，然后开始快步向前走去。

Panicking, Shinji forgot what was in his mouth and swallowed the gum in an attempt to swallow his spit. He grabbed his throat and gagged, and by the time he stood straight Asuka was already far away.  
惊慌失措的真嗣忘记了嘴里的东西，试图吞下口香糖来吞咽口水。他抓住喉咙干呕，等到他站直时，明日香已经走得很远了。

"Asu, ka!" he managed to choke out.  
“明日香，怎么了！”他勉强挤出话来。

Asuka didn't even pretend to hear him, instead picking up her pace. Shinji rushed forward and tried to grab her hand, but she turned away, avoiding him entirely. Shinji stopped again, momentarily confused.  
明日香连假装听见的意思都没有，反而加快了脚步。真嗣急忙上前试图抓住她的手，但她转身避开，完全不让他接近。真嗣再次停下，一时之间感到困惑。

_Did I see that right? Is Asuka... crying?  
我刚才看错了吗？明日香是在...哭吗？_

Shinji was stunned by this unexpected turn of events. Frustration quickly gave way to anger, and anger with no outlet turned, as it always did, inward.  
真嗣被这突如其来的变故惊呆了。挫败感迅速转化为愤怒，而无处发泄的愤怒一如既往地转向内心。

_I said something stupid and ruined everything. I made Asuka cry.  
我说了些蠢话，毁了一切。我让明日香哭了。_

_I was wrong to think that something so good could ever happen to me.  
我错了，以为这么好的事会发生在自己身上。_

The rest of the way home, Shinji kept his distance from Asuka. She led the way, never looking back, and Shinji followed about ten paces behind. Only when they reached the entrance to the apartment complex did Asuka stop walking and wait for him. Shinji cautiously moved to her side, keeping his head down, not daring to look at her face. He felt her gaze on him, but he continued to stare at his feet. After a few moments, Asuka let out a deep sigh.  
回家的路上，真嗣一直与明日香保持着距离。她走在前面，从不回头，而真嗣则跟在后面约十步之遥。直到他们到达公寓楼的入口，明日香才停下脚步，等待着他。真嗣小心翼翼地走到她身边，低着头，不敢直视她的脸。他感觉到她的目光落在自己身上，但他依旧盯着脚尖。片刻后，明日香深深地叹了口气。

Shinji cautiously lifted his head and studied Asuka's face. It was placid, but he could still see a redness about her eyes. Overwhelmed with a sense of helplessness, Shinji could only give her a hesitant nod.  
真嗣小心翼翼地抬起头，仔细观察明日香的脸。她的表情平静，但他仍能看出她眼周的红晕。被一种无助感淹没，真嗣只能向她投去一个犹豫的点头。

They didn't speak as they entered the house. They didn't hold hands or make eye contact.  
他们进屋时没有交谈。没有牵手，也没有眼神交流。

Misato wasn't home. Penpen was asleep in his refrigerator, with his bowl Shinji packed full hours ago half-empty now. Shinji wrapped it in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge, and when he came out of the bathroom after washing his face, Asuka was already in her room. Only the moonlight shone forlornly in the unlit hallway.  
美里不在家。Penpen 在他的冰箱里睡着了，几个小时前真嗣装满的碗现在半空着。真嗣用保鲜膜包好它，放进冰箱，当他洗完脸从浴室出来时，明日香已经在她的房间里了。只有月光孤零零地照在没有灯光的走廊上。

---

The next morning, Shinji woke up with a heavy heart, not unlike yesterday. Leaving his room, he stood in front of Asuka's door for a moment, then sighed and headed for the kitchen. The kitchen and living room were littered with signs of Ms. Misato's return, so he made her some toast and began grinding coffee. He was secretly hoping that all the noises and smells would wake Asuka up, but the only ones who crawled out to the kitchen were the penguin and Misato.  
第二天早上，真嗣带着沉重的心情醒来，和昨天没什么两样。离开房间后，他在明日香的门前站了一会儿，然后叹了口气，走向厨房。厨房和客厅里到处都是美里小姐回来的痕迹，于是他为她做了些吐司，开始磨咖啡。他暗自希望所有的噪音和气味能唤醒明日香，但唯一爬到厨房的只有企鹅和美里。

Heavy bags under Misato's eyes showed she was tired, but as soon as she saw Shinji's face, she brightened.  
美里眼下的黑眼圈很重，显示出她的疲惫，但一看到真嗣的脸，她就精神了起来。

"Morning. How was yesterday? Did you come back in time? Is Asuka still asleep?"  
早上好。昨天怎么样？你及时回来了吗？明日香还在睡吗？

Shinji smiled weakly and turned his attention to the coffee pot. He could feel Misato giving him a questioning look, but he said nothing.  
真嗣虚弱地笑了笑，将注意力转向咖啡壶。他能感觉到美里投来询问的目光，但他什么也没说。

At the table, Misato gave him a weird look, but soon enough she turned the conversation to Shinji's physical condition and her own lunch schedule. Those were questions Shinji had no problem answering. Breakfast went by like that, and soon Misato was getting ready to go out for her aforementioned lunch.  
在餐桌旁，美里奇怪地看了他一眼，但很快她就把话题转向了真嗣的身体状况和自己的午餐安排。这些问题真嗣回答起来毫无压力。早餐就这样过去了，不久美里准备出门去吃她之前提到的午餐。

Since he didn't feel like doing it now, Shinji put off doing the dishes for a while and went back to his room, throwing himself into bed. Nothing happened for a while and the house was quiet, except for Misato's shout of "I'm leaving! I'll probably be back before dinner!" from the kitchen, which he was forced to answer in a cheerful voice.  
既然现在不想做，真嗣便暂时搁置了洗碗的任务，回到自己的房间，一头栽倒在床上。一时间什么也没发生，屋内静悄悄的，除了美里从厨房传来的喊声：“我要出门了！晚饭前应该能回来！”他不得不以欢快的声音回应。

Little by little, resentment towards Asuka was boiling in Shinji's chest.  
对明日香的不满在真嗣胸中一点点沸腾。

As much as he wanted to stay in bed all day, when the clock struck 11, Shinji forced himself to sit up. He remembered the dishes he'd left out. Leaving them until lunch was unacceptable.  
尽管他很想整天赖在床上，但当钟声敲响 11 点时，真嗣还是强迫自己坐了起来。他想起了那些被他搁置的碗碟。留到午饭时间再处理是不可接受的。

That was when Asuka finally broke their silence and left her room.  
就在那时，明日香终于打破了沉默，离开了她的房间。

He didn't hear or see her. The water from the faucet was loud, and Shinji was busy scrubbing and wondering what exactly he'd done wrong yesterday. Rather, he _felt_ Asuka. She wrapped her arms around his chest from behind, embracing him.  
他没有听到或看到她。水龙头的水声很大，真嗣正忙着擦洗，同时思索着昨天究竟做错了什么。然而，他感觉到了明日香。她从背后伸出双臂环抱住他的胸膛，拥抱着他。

Shinji put down the dishes and turned off the water. He didn't miss the fact that this was the first time Asuka had hugged him, not the other way around, but his heart somehow didn't feel much joy. Shinji forced his mouth open. "I'm sorry, Asuka."  
真嗣放下碗碟，关掉了水。他并未忽略这是明日香第一次主动拥抱他，而非相反，但他的心中却并未感到多少喜悦。真嗣勉强张开了嘴。“对不起，明日香。”

He felt her arms tighten slightly.  
他感觉到她的手臂微微收紧。

"Sorry for what?" “为什麽道歉？”

It was the kind of question Shinji absolutely abhorred, but Asuka's voice wasn't accusatory. It was more like pure curiosity, and Shinji didn't feel too much pressure from such a tone.  
这种问题正是真嗣最讨厌的，但明日香的声音并不带指责。更多的是纯粹的好奇，真嗣并没有因此感到太大的压力。

"Yesterday. Ruining the date by saying stupid things. Not treating you as well as Mr. Kaji did."  
昨天。说了些蠢话，毁了约会。没有像加持先生那样好好对待你。

Honestly speaking, Shinji was still not sure what exactly he said yesterday that was so offensive. It probably had something to do with Mr. Kaji, since Asuka had mentioned him.  
老实说，真嗣仍然不确定昨天自己到底说了什么那么冒犯人。可能和加持先生有关，因为明日香提到了他。

"But... it wasn't your fault," Asuka whispered in Shinji's ear, her breath tickling his earlobe and sending chills down his skin.  
“但……这不是你的错，”明日香在真嗣耳边低语，她的气息轻拂过他的耳垂，让他感到一阵寒意。

Shinji smiled bitterly and tried not to flinch too much. It was the kind of answer he was hoping for, but it didn't make him feel better, because there was no admission of fault in those words. This was probably the extent of the apology he would get from this girl.  
真嗣苦笑了一下，尽量不让自己显得太过退缩。这是他所期待的回答，但并没有让他感觉好些，因为那些话里没有承认错误。这大概就是他能从这个女孩那里得到的道歉的极限了。

But he couldn't bring himself to say it, so he took the safer route. "Are you feeling better?"  
但他无法说出那句话，于是选择了更安全的说法。“你感觉好些了吗？”

"Yeah." "嗯。"

_Would you like breakfast now or would you rather wait for lunch?_ He didn't get a chance to ask her, because at that very moment, the doorbell rang. Asuka's arms loosened and the warmth vanished.  
你是想现在吃早餐，还是等午饭一起？他没来得及问她，因为就在那一刻，门铃响了。明日香的手臂松开了，那份温暖也随之消失。

"I'll check the door." "我去检查一下门。"

Shinji nodded, unsure if Asuka had seen it.  
真嗣点点头，不确定明日香是否看到了。

He realized something was off when he was done washing the two plates and a cup, leaving only the coffee pot and one last cup on the sink. Asuka still hadn't returned. Shinji turned off the water, took off his rubber gloves, hung them up, and then walked to the doorway.  
当他洗完两个盘子和一个杯子，水槽里只剩下咖啡壶和最后一个杯子时，他意识到有些不对劲。明日香还没有回来。真嗣关掉水龙头，摘下手套，挂好，然后走向门口。

Asuka was standing still in front of the door, her eye pressed against the peephole.  
明日香站在门前一动不动，眼睛紧贴着窥视孔。

_Was she doing that this whole time?_ Shinji wondered. _Why?_  
她一直这样吗？真嗣疑惑地想。为什么？

"Asuka? What is it?" “明日香？怎么了？”

Asuka's flinched, then she straightened her back and turned to face him.  
明日香微微一颤，随即挺直了背，转身面对他。

"Nothing." "没什么。"

Her body language as she walked toward him, her oddly flat tone, was incredibly suspicious. He started moving to the front door.  
她走向他的步伐，以及那异常平淡的语调，都显得极为可疑。他开始向门口移动。

Halfway down the hall, Asuka grabbed Shinji's shoulder. A hint of irritation was creeping into her face. "I told you, it's nothing!"  
走到走廊一半时，明日香抓住了真嗣的肩膀。一丝不悦正悄然爬上她的脸庞。“我说了，没事！”

Shinji twisted his shoulders and slipped out of her grasp. Now he had to see for himself, no matter what. Begging him to go and take a look would have been less effective than whatever Asuka was doing now. There was now anger in Asuka's body language as she turned and followed Shinji again, but Shinji didn't care. The priority was to find out what was causing this reaction.  
真嗣扭动肩膀，从她的手中挣脱。无论怎样，他现在必须亲自去看个究竟。求他去看看，效果还不如明日香现在所做的任何事。明日香转身再次跟上真嗣，她的肢体语言中已无愤怒，但真嗣并不在意。首要任务是查明是什么引发了这种反应。

Or so he thought, until he pressed his own eye against the peephole. At that point he regretted his decision and realized he should have just listened to her.  
他本以为如此，直到他将自己的眼睛贴在窥视孔上。那一刻，他后悔了自己的决定，意识到自己本该听她的话。

Because it was Kensuke Aida that was standing there, half of his face bandaged, shoulders slumped, looking down at the floor.  
因为站在那里的，是脸上缠着半边绷带、肩膀下垂、低头看着地板的铃原 Kensuke。

Shinji's mouth dried up. He turned around to see Asuka standing a few paces away, arms crossed, glaring at him. He turned his head again and brought his eye to the lens.  
真嗣的嘴巴干涩起来。他转过身，看到明日香站在几步之外，双臂交叉，瞪着他。他再次转过头，将眼睛凑到镜头前。

His old friend looked terrible. He was already as skinny as Shinji even before all this. Now he looked positively haggard. The bandage wrapped around one side of his face reminded Shinji of what Misato told him before. Cheekbone fractures. Ocular injury. Guilt washed over Shinji. He wanted to look away, but doing so was impossible.  
他的老朋友看起来糟透了。他原本就瘦得和真嗣差不多，现在更是憔悴不堪。缠绕在他脸颊一侧的绷带让真嗣想起了美里之前告诉他的话。颧骨骨折。眼部受伤。愧疚感涌上心头。他想移开视线，但那是不可能的。

_Why the hell is he here?_ The first word that came to mind was 'revenge', but that was ridiculous. Kensuke looked like he could be blown away by the slightest breeze, and the way he stood and the air around him were not at all aggressive.  
他到底为什么会在这里？脑海中首先浮现的词是“复仇”，但那太荒谬了。健介看起来弱不禁风，他站立的姿态和周围的气氛一点也不具攻击性。

Why indeed. He could've just disappeared from Shinji's life and not make him feel this... _whatever_ that currently filled his heart at the sight of him.  
为何如此。他本可以就这样从真嗣的生活中消失，不让他感受到这种...无论此刻看到他时心中涌动的是什么情感。

The thought made Shinji feel disgusted with himself, and then he felt ridiculous for feeling that way. Shinji had no reason to feel sorry for Kensuke. But if that was true, Shinji couldn't understand why his heart was pounding so hard.  
这个念头让真嗣对自己感到厌恶，随即又觉得这种感觉荒谬可笑。真嗣没有理由为健介感到难过。但如果这是真的，真嗣无法理解为何自己的心跳得如此剧烈。

_Should I open the door? And if I do, what should I say?  
我该开门吗？如果开了，我该说什么？_

Shinji didn't have much time to struggle anyway, because Kensuke was the first to turn and walk away. For reasons he couldn't quite fathom, Shinji almost cried out. The thought of being heard from outside, and the glare he was definitely feeling on the back of his head, made him shut up at the last moment.  
无论如何，真嗣没有太多时间挣扎，因为剑介是第一个转身离开的。出于某种他无法完全理解的原因，真嗣几乎要哭喊出来。想到会被外面的人听到，以及他肯定感受到的来自背后的目光，让他最后一刻闭上了嘴。

As if hearing his thoughts, Kensuke suddenly stopped, turned back and strode over with a determined air. Shinji's heart sank. As Shinji watched, Kensuke pulled something from his pants pocket, set it down carefully on the doorstep, and turned around. This time, he didn't look back.  
仿佛听到了他的心声，剑介突然停下，转过身来，带着坚定的神情大步走回。真嗣的心沉了下去。当真嗣看着剑介从裤袋里掏出某样东西，小心翼翼地放在门阶上，然后转身离开。这一次，他没有回头。

Shinji froze for a moment, then, with his teeth clenched, reached out and pushed the button once Kensuke was out of sight. The door swung open with a woosh. From behind came Asuka's voice, dripping with wrath.  
真嗣愣了一会儿，然后，咬紧牙关，在剑介消失在视线之外后伸出手按下了按钮。门呼地一声打开了。身后传来明日香的声音，充满了愤怒。

"What are you doing?!" "你在干什么？！"

Shinji ignored her, bending down to pick up the item on the doorstep. It was as he expected. An envelope. A letter in it, probably. _To Shinji_ was written on the top.  
真嗣没有理会她，弯腰捡起门口的东西。正如他所料，是一个信封。里面大概是一封信。信封上写着“给真嗣”。

Clutching the letter in his hand, Shinji turned around to be greeted by Asuka's searing eyes. "Give it to me," she hissed.  
真嗣紧握着手中的信，转过身来，迎上了明日香灼热的目光。“把它给我，”她低声说道。

Shinji shook his head. 真嗣摇了摇头。

"This is for me, Asuka."  
“这是给你的，明日香。”

Asuka lifted her chin. Her throat was quivering slightly. "I said _give it to me."_  
明日香抬起下巴，喉咙微微颤抖。“我说了，给我。”

Shinji looked away from Asuka and took a step forward. She moved to block his path, but Shinji had anticipated that and managed to sidestep her just in time. Asuka always complained at how small Japanese houses apparently were, but the hallway was still big enough for her and there was just enough room for Shinji to squeeze past.  
真嗣避开明日香的目光，向前迈了一步。她试图挡住他的去路，但真嗣预料到了这一点，及时侧身避开了她。明日香总是抱怨日本房子有多小，但走廊仍然足够宽敞，让她能站稳，而真嗣刚好能挤过去。

Asuka followed, stomping her feet. Shinji thought about closing the door as he entered his room, but before he could, Asuka followed him in. Shinji wanted to sigh.  
明日香紧随其后，重重地跺着脚。真嗣走进自己的房间时，本想关门，但还没来得及，明日香就跟了进来。真嗣想叹气。

"Asuka, what the hell is wrong with you?"  
“明日香，你到底怎么了？”

Asuka crossed her arms and snorted. It reminded Shinji of her behavior from her first weeks here. "That's the question I wanted to ask."  
明日香交叉双臂，哼了一声。这让真嗣想起了她刚来这里时的行为。“这正是我想问的。”

Shinji didn't say anything.  
真嗣什么也没说。

"So that pervy four-eyes has something to say to you, is that it? And you want to know what it is? He clearly has no intention of apologizing to me, but still has something to say to you, it seems."  
“所以那个色眯眯的四眼仔有话要对你说，是吗？你想知道是什么？他显然没打算向我道歉，但似乎还是有话要对你说。”

_Not like you apologized to me for yesterday either._ The thought flashed through Shinji's mind for a second, and it made him feel terrible. He was being unfair to Asuka. Those two incidents were hardly comparable, after all. But was she being fair to Shinji?  
“你昨天也没向我道歉。”这个念头在真嗣脑海中闪过一瞬，让他感到很难受。他对明日香不公平。毕竟，这两件事几乎无法相提并论。但她对真嗣公平吗？

_Absolutely not._ Hanging his resentment against her to that last thought, Shinji clenched his teeth.  
绝对不行。他将怨恨挂在心头，紧咬牙关。

"You won't know what it says until you see it. I'll see it for myself, and then decide what to do with it, and then I'll show it to you. No. You know what, maybe we can read it together, if that's what you want."  
“你不看到它就不会知道内容。我会亲自查看，然后决定如何处理，再给你看。不。你知道吗，也许我们可以一起读，如果你愿意的话。”

Shinji thought that was a pretty reasonable compromise, but Asuka didn't seem to agree. "No, give it to me."  
真嗣认为这是个相当合理的妥协，但明日香似乎并不认同。“不，把它给我。”

"What will you do with it if I give it to you?"  
"如果我给你，你会拿它做什么？"

"Put it where it belongs. In the trash can."  
"把它放回它该去的地方。垃圾桶里。"

Shinji shook his head. Asuka's eyes narrowed.  
真嗣摇了摇头。明日香的眼睛眯了起来。

"You leave me no choice, Shinji."  
"你让我别无选择，真嗣。"

Before he could ask what exactly he made her choose, Asuka lunged at him. Shinji quickly jerked the hand with the letter back, out of Asuka's reach. The next moment, her shoulder slammed into Shinji's stomach, and they fell on top of his bed together. Air escaped his lungs and tears stung his eyes, but Shinji didn't give in, pushing Asuka away with one hand and clutching the letter tightly in the other. With gasps and groans and bitten-off curses, they wrestled, rolling this way and that as their limbs flailed and scrabbled. It was unclear who, but someone kicked the pillow away, flinging it out of his room, and the blanket ended up crumpled on the floor instead of the bed.  
在他还没来得及问她究竟选择了什么之前，明日香已经向他扑来。真嗣迅速将握着信的手抽回，避开明日香的触碰。下一刻，她的肩膀猛地撞上他的腹部，两人一起跌落在他的床上。空气从他的肺中逃逸，泪水刺痛了他的眼睛，但真嗣没有屈服，用一只手推开明日香，另一只手紧紧抓住信件。伴随着喘息、呻吟和咬牙切齿的咒骂，他们扭打在一起，翻滚着，四肢乱舞。不知是谁踢开了枕头，将其甩出房间，而毯子则皱成一团，落在了地板上，而非床上。

Soon, they reached a stalemate. Both were exhausted, unable to subdue each other in the end. They glared venomously at each other, lying on their sides with their legs tangled together, breathing heavily.  
不久，他们陷入了僵局。双方都筋疲力尽，最终无法制服对方。他们恶狠狠地瞪着彼此，侧身躺着，双腿交缠，呼吸沉重。

As they lay there, face to face, breath and body heat mingling, Shinji was reminded that neither he nor Asuka had showered or brushed their teeth since yesterday. Normally, this would have disgusted him, but in this case all it did was remind him of exactly how he felt about this girl.  
他们就这样面对面躺着，呼吸与体温交织在一起，这让真嗣想起他和明日香从昨天起就没有洗澡或刷牙。通常这会让他感到厌恶，但此刻这仅仅让他更加清晰地感受到自己对这个女孩的感情。

Whatever she was thinking, Asuka's face also showed no sign of the anger that had filled it a moment ago. She merely stared at Shinji with a strange expression on her face.  
无论她在想什么，明日香的脸上也没有显露出片刻之前的愤怒。她只是带着一种奇怪的表情凝视着真嗣。

The skin of Asuka's bare legs was impossibly soft against his own. The heat of them, the scent of her, how very close their faces were - all of it was causing Shinji's groin to stiffen. Their legs were still tangled, so it pushed hard against Asuka's thighs. Heat rose to Shinji's face. The only thing between his erection and her bare skin was two thin layers of fabric. It was almost unbearable, but Shinji couldn't have pulled away even if he wanted to. Instead, impulsively, Shinji reached out and stroked Asuka's hair. The part of it just behind her ear. Asuka shuddered beneath his touch. Shinji's blush deepened as he felt her motion against him.  
明日香裸露的双腿肌肤触感异常柔软，与他的紧贴着。她的体温、她的气息，以及他们如此近距离的脸庞——这一切都让真嗣的下体变得坚硬。他们的腿依然缠绕在一起，这使得他的坚挺紧紧抵在明日香的大腿上。真嗣的脸颊发热，他的勃起与她裸露的肌肤之间仅隔着两层薄薄的布料。这几乎让他难以忍受，但即使他想，真嗣也无法抽身离开。相反，他冲动地伸出手，轻抚明日香的头发，就在她耳后的部分。明日香在他的触摸下颤抖。真嗣的脸颊更红了，他感受到她的动作紧贴着自己。

"You want to forgive him, Shinji. Is that it?"  
"你想原谅他，真嗣。是这样吗？"

Shinji managed to comprehend enough of the question to shake his head reflexively, but upon further reflection he honestly wasn't sure.  
真嗣勉强理解了问题的意思，本能地摇了摇头，但仔细一想，他其实并不确定。

_Do I?_ But it didn't seem right. He could never forgive Kensuke for humiliating his Asuka like that. But…  
我真的想吗？但这似乎不对。他永远无法原谅健介那样羞辱他的明日香。但是……

Asuka smiled sadly and lifted her hand to wrap it around Shinji's. The weight of it pushed Shinji's hand down to cup her cheek. "You're a good person, Shinji. You can't hate others for long. That also makes you naive."  
明日香苦涩地笑了笑，抬起手环绕住真嗣的手。这份重量让真嗣的手向下移动，轻抚她的脸颊。“你是个好人，真嗣。你无法长久地恨别人。这也让你显得天真。”

"Asuka..." "明日香……"

Asuka shook her head, interrupting him. "Shinji."  
明日香摇了摇头，打断了他。“真嗣。”

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"You're my boyfriend now, aren't you?"  
“你现在是我男朋友了，对吧？”

Asuka's voice was shaky, her eyes wide and beginning to water just the smallest bit. Shinji's heart fluttered. Both the question and the answer were things he'd never imagined, and now there was nothing else more important to him.  
明日香的声音颤抖着，双眼睁得大大的，眼角微微泛起了泪光。真嗣的心跳加速了。这个问题和答案都是他从未设想过的，此刻对他来说，再没有比这更重要的事了。

Shinji swallowed hard and nodded. "Yes."  
真嗣艰难地咽了口唾沫，点了点头。“是的。”

The corners of Asuka's mouth curled up. If she had told him then and there to give her the letter, Shinji would have obliged, even if he thought it was a bit unfair. In fact, he had expected her to do so from the moment he heard the question, and he already resigned himself to the fact that he was in a trap with no way out. But Asuka betrayed Shinji's prediction.  
明日香嘴角微微上扬。如果她当时就让他把信交给她，真嗣会照做的，即使他觉得这有点不公平。事实上，从他听到那个问题的那一刻起，他就预料到她会这么做，并且已经接受了自己陷入一个无法逃脱的陷阱的事实。但明日香却出乎真嗣的预料。

"Well, since you're my boyfriend, I'll tell you a secret I have never told anyone else. A secret that can help you in this situation."  
“好吧，既然你是我的男朋友，我就告诉你一个我从没告诉过别人的秘密。一个能帮你解决这个情况的秘密。”

"Asuka...?" "明日香...？"

"That bastard hurt you, and you were angry, right?"  
"那个混蛋伤害了你，你很生气，对吧？"

Shinji bit his lip slightly. Without waiting for an answer, Asuka continued.  
真嗣微微咬了咬嘴唇。没等回答，明日香继续说道。

"So you hated him, you got angry, you hit him, and you stopped being his friend. And then, after a while, you started to let it go, because you got tired of being angry and hateful all the time. You just wanted to forget about it, to put it behind you, because it's hard. It's really hard to keep that anger burning inside you. You want to stop. I do that sometimes, too, especially when it's not clear who I should be angry at.  
“所以你恨他，你生气了，你打了他，然后你不再是他的朋友。过了一段时间，你开始放下这一切，因为你厌倦了总是愤怒和怨恨。你只想忘记它，把它抛在脑后，因为这很难。真的很难一直保持内心的怒火。你想停下来。我有时也会这样，特别是当我不清楚应该对谁生气的时候。”

"Still, even when you do know exactly who you're supposed to be mad at, and even when you're rightfully angry, it's still difficult sometimes. Because they start reaching out to you. They want to give you gifts. They try to guilt trip you, or rationalize whatever happened in a way that makes you want to forgive them. They say that you should stop fighting, that everybody should stop fighting, that they're sorry, that you're stuck seeing each other all the time anyway so why not just make amends. They try to deceive you by acting all nice so you lower your guard, so they can hurt you even more."  
“尽管如此，即使你知道你应该对谁生气，即使你的愤怒是正当的，有时仍然很困难。因为他们开始向你伸出援手。他们想送你礼物。他们试图让你感到内疚，或者合理化发生的事情，让你想要原谅他们。他们说你应该停止争斗，每个人都应该停止争斗，他们很抱歉，反正你们总是会见面，为什么不和解呢。他们试图通过表现得非常友好来欺骗你，让你放松警惕，这样他们就能更深地伤害你。”

Shinji blinked. Asuka's soft eyes were looking somewhere far away, not at Shinji, and he fell into that blue sea as if under a spell.  
真嗣眨了眨眼。明日香温柔的眼睛望向远方，没有看真嗣，他仿佛被施了魔法一般沉入了那片蓝色的海洋。

_Who hurt you so much, Asuka?_ Shinji wanted to ask. The thought broke his heart. He felt a lump rising in his throat. He wanted to grab her shoulders and pull her into a crushing embrace, but she started talking again before he could.  
是谁让你受了这么多伤，明日香？真嗣想问。这个念头让他心碎。他感到喉咙哽咽。他想抓住她的肩膀，将她紧紧拥入怀中，但她又开始说话了，他还没来得及行动。

"Shinji." "真嗣。"

Shinji was startled, as if he'd just been woken up. Asuka dropped the hand that was holding his and pressed it to her chest.  
真嗣吓了一跳，仿佛刚从梦中惊醒。明日香松开了握着他的手，按在自己的胸口上。

"I have a book in here. A book with the names of all the people who hurt me, and everything they did to me. Whenever my heart softens, whenever I think of letting them back in, I open that book. So I can hate them again, just like I hated them in that first moment."  
“我这里有一本书。一本记录了所有伤害我的人，以及他们对我所做的一切的书。每当我的心软下来，每当我想让他们再次进入我的生活时，我就会打开那本书。这样我就可以再次憎恨他们，就像我最初那一刻憎恨他们一样。”

Shinji's lips parted slightly, but no words came out, because Asuka's eyes were hardening.  
真嗣的嘴唇微微张开，却未吐一言，因为明日香的眼神正变得冷硬。

"Shinji, do as I say. Think back to the moment he made you angry. Relive the emotions you felt then. And think about how he-" Asuka's mouth clamped shut, then opened again. "Think about how he humiliated me. Then think again about whether you really want to make peace. Whether you really want to read the words he wrote in his selfish letter. He's just doing it because he wants to make himself feel better."  
“真嗣，照我说的做。回想他让你愤怒的那一刻。重温你当时感受到的情绪。然后想想他是如何——”明日香的嘴突然紧闭，随即又张开。“想想他是如何羞辱我的。然后再想想你是否真的想要和解。是否真的想读他那封自私的信里写的话。他这么做只是为了让自己感觉好受些。”

Shinji did as Asuka said. He thought about the anger he'd felt that fateful day, and then he thought about his dream. Maybe the latter was unfair. It wasn't like Kensuke had actually done the things in the dream, but there was no denying the reality of the feelings that gave rise to it in the first place. The feelings of rage that he had almost forgotten while spending time with Asuka were rekindled.  
真嗣照明日香说的做了。他想起了那个决定性日子里的愤怒，然后又想到了自己的梦。或许后者并不公平。毕竟健介并没有真的做出梦中的那些事，但不可否认的是，那些最初引发梦境的情感是真实存在的。与明日香共度的时光几乎让他忘记了这些愤怒，如今却又重新燃起。

Asuka was right. There was no more hesitation in him as he handed the letter over to her. It was easy now.  
明日香说得没错。他递过信时已不再犹豫。现在一切都变得简单了。

But Asuka didn't take it.  
但明日香没有接过信。

Asuka shook her head at Shinji, who was looking at her with questioning eyes. Her red hair rustled against the bedsheets.  
明日香对真嗣摇了摇头，后者正用询问的眼神看着她。她的红发在床单上轻轻摩擦，发出沙沙声。

"No, no. You can't just give it away."  
"不，不行。你不能就这么送人。"

Shinji didn't understand. This was exactly what she was asking for just a moment ago. "Then?"  
真嗣不明白。这正是她刚才所要求的。“那然后呢？”

"Tear it up. With your hands."  
"撕掉它。用手。"

Shinji doubted his ears for a moment. Confusion replaced the doubt, then anger replaced the confusion. All the warm things he had been feeling for this girl just moments ago vanished. She was clearly crossing a line.  
真嗣一时怀疑自己的耳朵。困惑取代了疑虑，随即愤怒又取代了困惑。就在片刻之前，他对这个女孩的所有温情都消失殆尽。她显然越界了。

"Asuka, that's not-" “明日香，那不是——”

Asuka's hands shot up. Shinji flinched, expecting something bad, but they gently cupped his face instead. For a moment Shinji was taken aback by the sheer warmth of her hands, then shivered as he realized the fire in her eyes burned even hotter.  
明日香的手迅速抬起。真嗣一缩，以为会有不好的事发生，但她的手却温柔地捧住了他的脸。有那么一刻，真嗣被她双手的温暖所震撼，随即又因意识到她眼中的火焰燃烧得更炽热而颤抖。

"Shinji, do as I say, and I'll give you a reward. Something I wanted to give you last night. Something you earned. If you don't, I'll, I'll…"  
"真嗣，照我说的做，我会给你一个奖励。昨晚我想给你的东西。你应得的。如果你不做，我，我就会……"

Shinji's heart sank at the implication. _Will you write my name in your book?_  
真嗣的心沉了下去，意识到她的意图。你会把我的名字写在你的书上吗？

Feeling his throat burn, Shinji looked down at the letter in his hand. It was crumpled from the previous struggle, but the envelope still held its shape. A letter from Kensuke. What it said, Shinji didn't know. If Asuka had her way, he never would.  
真嗣感到喉咙一阵灼热，低头看着手中的信。信已经被之前的挣扎弄得皱巴巴的，但信封依然保持着形状。这是来自健介的信。信里说了什么，真嗣不知道。如果明日香得逞，他永远也不会知道。

And he was fine with that up to that point. He was going to hand it over to Asuka, after all. And he meant it. But this...asking him to tear it himself was too much. It crossed a line. It was humiliating, it was demanding Shinji to…to…it was hard for him to put into words. It felt like submission. An action that overrode his own sense of decency. And she was knowingly inflicting this humiliation upon him.  
在那之前，他对此并无异议。毕竟，他原本就打算把它交给明日香。他是认真的。但这种...要求他自己撕毁，太过分了。这越界了。这是羞辱，要求真嗣...去...他难以用言语表达。感觉像是屈服。一个践踏了他自身良知的行为。而她明知故犯，将这份羞辱强加于他。

But as Shinji raised his eyes to Asuka, his eyes full of resentment, he realized that Asuka's eyes were wavering. Only then did he realize that it was actually hurting her.  
但当真嗣抬起眼，满含怨恨地看向明日香时，他发现明日香的目光在动摇。直到那时，他才意识到这其实也在伤害她。

_Why am I doing this?_ The question suddenly made him feel stupid. It was ridiculous that he was fighting her over a letter from a creep who had taken inappropriate pictures of the girl he liked. He should have torn it up himself before Asuka even said a word, but he didn't, and now he was making Asuka the villain in this situation. With that, Shinji took the letter in both hands.  
我为什么要这么做？这个问题突然让他觉得自己很愚蠢。为一个变态偷拍的信件与她争执，实在荒谬。他本应在明日香开口之前就自己撕掉它，但他没有，现在却让明日香成了这场争执中的恶人。想到这里，真嗣双手接过了信。

What he was about to do suddenly seemed like the obviously correct choice. What she was asking was completely reasonable once he thought about it from her perspective, and the ridiculous choice in this situation was to keep denying her. Shinji kept telling himself that.  
他即将要做的事情突然显得如此显而易见且正确。一旦他从她的角度考虑，她所要求的完全合情合理，而在这种情况下，荒谬的选择反而是继续拒绝她。真嗣不断地这样告诉自己。

But if that was the case, why did it feel like his heart was ripping right along with the paper?  
但如果真是这样，为什么他的心会像那张纸一样被撕裂呢？

Why did the sight of the torn-up pieces of Kensuke's letter in his hand make his throat burn? Why was he feeling resentment rising once again?  
为什么手中肯斯克信件的碎片让他喉咙发烫？为什么他再次感到怨恨在心头升起？

Asuka let out a small sigh. Shinji raised his eyes and glared at Asuka.  
明日香轻轻叹了口气。真嗣抬起眼，瞪向明日香。

_Are you satisfied now, now that you made me submit to you?  
你现在满意了吗，让我屈服于你之后？_

But Shinji couldn't keep up the glare for long. Because Asuka was smiling, and it lit up her whole face, making it shine like the sun and melt his frozen heart. For a moment, Shinji thought that all of his life, all his worries and triumphs and suffering, had been for this one singular sight, and that this alone, her smile, was enough of a reward.  
但真嗣的瞪视没能持续多久。因为明日香在微笑，那笑容照亮了她的整张脸，宛如阳光般灿烂，融化了他的冰封之心。有那么一刻，真嗣觉得他的一生，所有的忧虑、胜利与苦难，都是为了这一刻的景象，而她的微笑，本身就是足够的回报。

But Shinji was wrong. This was not the reward Asuka had in mind.  
但真嗣错了。这并非明日香所想的那种奖励。

"Well done, Shinji," she whispered.  
“干得好，真嗣，”她低声说道。

Asuka leaned into him. Reflexively Shinji tried to pull his head away, but Asuka's hands held him in place gently yet firmly. Just as he realized what was happening, Asuka kissed him. Shinji closed his eyes.  
明日香靠向他。真嗣本能地想把头移开，但明日香的手温柔而坚定地固定住了他。就在他意识到发生了什么时，明日香吻了他。真嗣闭上了眼睛。

Her lips burned themselves straight through his and down to his soul like a branding iron, claiming him for all eternity. It was terrible pain and exhilarating pleasure rolled into one. It was the soaring realization that there was one person on the planet who loved him. Who wanted him. He had craved this all his life without even knowing what exactly it was he wanted. It was as if his heart had been cracked wide open and radiant sunlight now shone down into the tenebrous woeful depths of it, throwing all its yawning pits and jagged cracks and brooding empty plains into sharp relief and making him see the world in a whole new light. It was excruciating. It was transcendent. Shinji knew that he would never be the same.  
她的唇如烙铁般直透他的灵魂，永恒地标记了他。那是痛苦与快感交织的体验。他意识到，在这个世界上有一个人爱着他，渴望着他。他一生都在无意识地渴望着这份情感。仿佛他的心被彻底剖开，灿烂的阳光照进了那阴暗悲惨的深处，将所有深邃的裂缝、尖锐的断层和沉寂的荒原清晰地映照出来，让他以全新的视角看待世界。这既痛苦又超凡。真嗣明白，他再也不会是原来的自己了。

He didn't blame Asuka anymore. He didn't condemn her; everything she did she did because she wanted him so badly. Therefore on what grounds could he complain? He wanted to apologize for his foolishness and beg her, on his knees, to please forgive him. A letter from a stupid pervert wasn't worth what he was getting from her right now, and he should never have hurt her over it. Shinji wanted to cry.  
他不再责怪明日香。他不谴责她；她所做的一切都是因为她如此渴望他。那么，他还有什么理由抱怨呢？他想为自己的愚蠢道歉，跪下来恳求她原谅。一封来自愚蠢变态者的信，远不及他此刻从她那里得到的珍贵，他本不该因那封信而伤害她。真嗣想要哭泣。

When her lips disappeared with a wet noise, Shinji opened his eyes. He saw through his own tears that Asuka's whole face was on fire and her eyes were full of tears too. Shinji wanted to ask if she felt the same way as he did now, if she felt as full as he did now, if she liked him as much as he liked her, if she even knew how much he liked her.  
当她的唇伴随着湿润的声音消失时，真嗣睁开了眼睛。透过自己的泪水，他看到明日香的整张脸都像着了火一样，她的眼睛也充满了泪水。真嗣想问她是否也感受到了他此刻的心情，是否也感到如此充实，是否也像他喜欢她一样喜欢他，是否知道他有多么喜欢她。

But when Shinji opened his mouth, what came out of it wasn't anything so articulate, but instead an animalistic noise that vaguely resembled _Asuka_ as he lunged forward and crushed his mouth to hers.  
但当真嗣张开嘴时，从他口中发出的并不是任何如此清晰的话语，而是一种类似动物的噪音，他在模糊中仿佛看到了明日香，然后猛地向前扑去，将他的嘴唇紧紧贴在她的唇上。

Even now, there was fear in Shinji's heart. Fear of rejection. Fear of being told to back off, that he was given a reward already and should not demand more. That he had crossed the line. But what escaped Asuka's mouth was not a cold rebuke but a happy squeal of surprise. It was a sound he had never heard her make before, and the fact that he alone was the cause of it solidified both his resolve and his erection.  
即使现在，真嗣心中仍有恐惧。害怕被拒绝。害怕被要求退后，他已经得到了奖励，不应该再要求更多。他越界了。但明日香口中发出的不是冷漠的斥责，而是一声惊喜的欢叫。这是他从未听她发出过的声音，而他是唯一引起这个声音的原因，这不仅坚定了他的决心，也让他更加兴奋。

His body surged forward, trapping her between himself and the wall. He kissed her deeply, open-mouthed, and her lips parted beneath his in response. He dared to slip his tongue between them and _she let him._ She let him. Their tongues scraped against each other and Shinji moaned involuntarily at the sensation. _This should be gross,_ a part of Shinji's mind noted distantly. But the sensation was the exact opposite. It completely blew all his fantasies out of the water and into oblivion because here, kissing him back, was the real thing. Asuka shuddered and her hands tangled themselves in the hair at the back of his head, gripping his neck, pulling him closer, closer, closer. His hips were bucking uncontrollably, grinding himself against her warmth through their clothes, and she flung one leg over his waist, giving him easier access, her back arching to press as much of herself as she could against him.  
他的身体猛地前倾，将她困在自己与墙壁之间。他深吻着她，双唇张开，她的唇瓣在他的吻下微微分开。他大胆地将舌头探入，她没有拒绝。她允许了他。两人的舌头相互摩擦，真嗣不由自主地发出呻吟。这本应是令人厌恶的，真嗣的内心某处遥远地提醒着。但这种感觉却恰恰相反。它彻底击溃了他所有的幻想，将其抛入虚无，因为此刻，回吻着他，是真实的存在。明日香颤抖着，双手缠绕在他脑后的发丝中，紧抓着他的脖颈，将他拉得更近，更近，更近。他的臀部不由自主地摆动，隔着衣物在她温暖的身躯上摩擦，她将一条腿搭在他的腰间，为他提供更方便的接触，她的背部弯曲，尽可能地将身体紧贴着他。

When he ran his tongue across the roof of her mouth, Asuka made a high breathy mewling noise that sent a bolt of desire arcing through him that made him throb dangerously. With a gasp, he disengaged, rolling away from her onto his back. He stared at the ceiling, dazed and panting.  
当他用舌头轻扫过她口腔的上颚时，明日香发出了一声高亢而喘息的呻吟，这声音如同一道欲望的闪电贯穿了他，让他感到危险的悸动。他倒抽一口气，挣脱开来，翻身仰躺在床上。他凝视着天花板，眼神迷离，喘息不止。

Asuka wiped her mouth with the back of her hand and looked down at him. Her face was bright red. The expression on it was petulant, uncertain. Heartbreakingly vulnerable. "Why'd you stop?" she asked plaintively.  
明日香用手背擦了擦嘴，低头看着他。她的脸颊通红。脸上的表情带着些许恼怒，又有些不确定。令人心碎的脆弱。“你为什么停下？”她哀怨地问道。

"I, ah. I." He shut his eyes, suddenly embarrassed. It was hard to concentrate past the haze in his mind. Just looking at her made him want to yank her down on top of him again and…and…and he'd better not finish that thought. He gestured vaguely at the tent in his shorts. "Was gonna, um. Make a mess."  
“我，呃。我。”他闭上眼睛，突然感到尴尬。脑海中的迷雾让他难以集中注意力。只是看着她，就让他想再次把她拉到自己身上，然后……然后……他最好别再想下去了。他含糊地指了指短裤下的帐篷。“要，呃。弄脏了。”

"Oh. _Oh."_ “哦。哦。”

The bed creaked as Asuka shifted position. When Shinji opened his eyes, she was straddling his torso on hands and knees. Her long red hair fell on either side of her head, tickling Shinji's cheeks. She was smirking at him, but her eyes were warm.  
床随着明日香变换姿势而吱吱作响。当真嗣睁开眼睛时，她正双手双膝跨坐在他的躯干上。她那长长的红发从两侧垂下，轻拂着真嗣的脸颊。她对他露出微笑，但眼中却充满了温情。

"You're so greedy. I said a reward, not rewards."  
“你真是贪心。我说的是一个奖励，不是多个奖励。”

"Sorry." "对不起。"

Asuka laughed. "Don't apologize for wanting me. Are you an idiot?"  
明日香笑了起来。“别为想要我而道歉。你是傻瓜吗？”

Shinji felt tears well up in his eyes at the words. He couldn't think of a reply, so he just nodded.  
听到这些话，真嗣感到泪水涌上了眼眶。他想不出回应的话，只能点点头。

Asuka curled up on her side beside him. They lied together side by side in momentary silence, catching their breath. Asuka stared at Shinji with the face of a satisfied cat, while Shinji wiggled his legs, trying to adjust his shorts because they were _still_ way too tight. His efforts didn't go unnoticed. Asuka's gaze dropped down and she grinned as if it was funny. Shinji wanted to find a hole to hide in, heat rising in his face.  
明日香蜷缩在他身边，两人并排躺着，暂时沉默地喘息。明日香像一只满足的猫一样盯着真嗣，而真嗣则扭动着双腿，试图调整短裤，因为它们还是太紧了。他的努力没有被忽视。明日香的目光落了下来，她咧嘴一笑，好像觉得很有趣。真嗣想找个地洞钻进去，脸上热辣辣的。

Luckily for Shinji, Asuka didn't say anything about it. Probably because she was in a good mood right now and didn't want to tease him.  
幸运的是，明日香对此什么也没说。可能是因为她现在心情很好，不想逗他。

"I'm hungry. Make me something."  
"我饿了。给我弄点吃的。"

Shinji nodded and awkwardly stood up. Asuka picked up the pieces of the letter, which had been forgotten during the kiss and were rolling around on the bed. Shinji said nothing and headed for the kitchen.  
真嗣点点头，尴尬地站起身。明日香捡起了那封在亲吻时被遗忘、散落在床上的信件碎片。真嗣一言不发，走向厨房。

Shinji was humming and preparing lunch when Asuka joined him, in different shorts for some reason. Asuka glanced over Shinji's shoulder to check what he was cooking, then walked over to the trash can and tossed the pieces of Kensuke's letter into it. Shinji felt oddly hollow as he watched. But a moment later, when Asuka walked over to him with a huge smile on her face and asked, "Want me to help?" the strange feeling vanished, leaving only a warm glow.  
真嗣哼着小曲准备午餐时，明日香不知为何换了条短裤，走进了厨房。她从真嗣的肩膀上瞥了一眼他在做什么，然后走到垃圾桶旁，将 Kensuke 的信件碎片扔了进去。真嗣看着这一幕，感到一种莫名的空虚。但片刻之后，当明日香带着灿烂的笑容走到他身边，问道：“要我帮忙吗？”那种奇怪的感觉便消失了，只留下了一股暖意。

### Chapter 12 Dissonance

John Langley, retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel and KMW lobbyist, took a moment to reflect on his previous life and the choices that had led him to this point. Bemused by the fact that he was feeling more pressure now than he'd felt even in Panama or Kuwait, he let out a small sigh and knocked on the door.  
约翰·兰利，退役的美国陆军中校兼 KMW 游说者，花了一会儿时间回顾自己过去的生活和那些将他引至此处的选择。他对现在感受到的压力甚至超过在巴拿马或科威特时的这一事实感到困惑，轻轻叹了口气，然后敲了敲门。

"I said no!" "我说了不行！"

An irritated yell stabbed his ears from the room beyond, but he didn't flinch. Despite doing her best to intimidate him, Asuka's voice still had that shrillness typical of an angry ten-year-old girl. He stopped himself before a bark of laughter escaped him. Even that supposed "next-generation soldier program" within that oh-so-secret paramilitary organization wasn't enough to remove the childishness from her voice.  
从房间另一头传来的恼怒喊声刺痛了他的耳朵，但他没有退缩。尽管明日香竭力想吓唬他，她的声音依然带着那种典型的、愤怒的十岁小女孩的尖锐。他及时忍住，才没让一声笑声脱口而出。即便那个所谓的“下一代战士计划”隐藏在那个神秘的准军事组织中，也没能从她的声音中抹去那份稚气。

Truly, he would've laughed, if his daughter hadn't spoken in Japanese.  
说真的，如果不是女儿用日语说话，他早就笑了。

It wasn't because he didn't understand the language. Quite the opposite; he had served in the USFJ and had been married to a half-Japanese woman at one point. His Japanese was a bit rusty as of late, but that didn't mean he couldn't understand a simple sentence like the one his daughter just shouted.  
这并非因为他不懂这门语言。恰恰相反，他曾在驻日美军服役，并且一度与一位日美混血女性结婚。他的日语近来有些生疏，但这并不意味着他连女儿刚刚喊出的简单句子都听不懂。

What offended him was the fact that his daughter, under his roof, had broken the rule that he had laid down. He saw it as a direct challenge to his authority as the head of this household, and it wasn't something he could tolerate, especially when that rule was the reason that he was here on the doorstep of his daughter's room. He had left work early for this. He never left work early.  
真正让他感到不快的是，女儿在他家中违反了他定下的规矩。他认为这是对他作为一家之主权威的直接挑战，这种行为是他无法容忍的，尤其是当这条规矩正是他此刻站在女儿房门口的原因时。他为此提前离开了工作岗位。他从不提前离开工作岗位。

He cleared his throat once. "Asuka Langley," he said, in a tone only slightly milder than one he'd take with a disobedient subordinate. "Open this door. _Now._"  
他清了清嗓子，用一种仅比对待不服从命令的下属稍温和的语气说道：“明日香·兰格雷，开门。现在。”

The harsh German words left a tense silence in their wake. It wasn't until he took a breath to clear his throat once again that he heard small footsteps.  
那严厉的德语词汇在他们身后留下了一片紧张的沉默。直到他再次清了清喉咙，才听到轻微的脚步声。

As soon as the door opened, and before he could say anything, Asuka turned and stomped her way to her bed. He shook his head slightly at the girl's petty defiance, stroking his mustache, then followed her inside.  
门一开，还没等他说什么，明日香就转身跺着脚走向她的床。他对女孩这种幼稚的反抗微微摇头，捋了捋胡子，然后跟着她进了房间。

His daughter was dressed in her tan NERV uniform, tailored to fit her little body. She must not have changed her clothes since returning from her afternoon training session, nor after her fight with Emma.  
他的女儿穿着她那件量身定做的棕褐色 NERV 制服，紧贴着她的小身体。她一定是从下午的训练回来后就没换过衣服，和她与艾玛的争吵之后也一样。

Every time he saw her in that uniform, ambivalent, conflicting feelings rose up and overwhelmed him.  
每次看到她穿着那身制服，他心中便涌起复杂的情感，交织着矛盾与冲突。

On the one hand, he felt an odd sense of pride, as the crisp uniform and her youthful face reminded him of his own JROTC years. It also reminded him of the fact that his family's proud legacy of military service, which could be traced all the way back to the Civil War, was being carried on, albeit a bit differently than usual. He would have preferred a son in that uniform, to be honest, but a daughter wearing it didn't hurt his pride. He couldn't change the fact that Asuka was a girl, and neither he nor Emma were young enough to have a new child, so he had long since accepted that reality.  
一方面，他感到一种莫名的自豪，那笔挺的制服和她年轻的脸庞让他回想起自己参加 JROTC 的岁月。这也提醒他，家族引以为傲的军旅传承，可以追溯到南北战争时期，正以一种不同寻常的方式延续着。老实说，他更希望有个儿子穿上这身制服，但女儿穿上它同样不损他的骄傲。他无法改变明日香是女孩的事实，他和艾玛也不再年轻到能再要一个孩子，所以他早已接受了这一现实。

But on the other hand, he couldn't help but feel uneasy at the sight of her. She was still too young, younger than standard JROTC cadets even now. The age at which they started training her was, in his opinion, frankly ridiculous. And not just that. His only child had never been easy, but she was becoming increasingly temperamental these days. She was quite noticeably losing faith, too, throwing tantrums every time he and Emma dragged her to church and refusing to say grace at the table or her prayers before bed. He always suspected the secret, unverified training program of that shadowy paramilitary organization was the culprit. A bad influence.  
但另一方面，看到她时他总忍不住感到不安。她依然太年轻，甚至比标准的 JROTC 学员还要小。他认为，他们开始训练她的年龄简直荒谬至极。不仅如此，他唯一的女儿从来就不省心，最近更是变得越来越情绪化。她明显地失去了信仰，每次他和艾玛带她去教堂时都会发脾气，拒绝在餐桌上祈祷或睡前祷告。他一直怀疑那个神秘的准军事组织的秘密、未经证实的训练计划是罪魁祸首。一个不良影响。

And he was certain that this 'NERV' was not to be trusted. Ironically, the payment they were offering him in exchange for his daughter was proof of that. It wasn't the money and the other, less tangible benefits that they offered that made him agree to the deal, but the readiness with which those things were given. A large cash stipend with no strings attached. A dizzying array of connections that were suddenly available to him, the sort that average lobbyists could only dream of.  
而他确信这个‘NERV’不可信任。讽刺的是，他们为了交换他的女儿所提供的报酬恰恰证明了这一点。让他同意交易的并非是金钱和其他无形的好处，而是这些东西被给予的毫不犹豫。一笔无附加条件的大额现金补贴。突然间向他敞开的一系列联系，那种普通说客只能梦寐以求的资源。

With the kind of career he had, he knew well enough that turning down such an offer from those who could mobilize those kinds of resources was a dangerous thing in itself. He also knew that he already had ties to these people from the beginning whether he liked it or not, thanks to his late wife. He had yet to receive a satisfactory explanation for the cause of her accident.  
以他的职业生涯，他深知拒绝那些能调动如此资源的人的提议本身就是一件危险的事。他也明白，无论自己是否愿意，从一开始就因已故妻子而与这些人有了牵连。关于她事故的原因，他至今未得到一个令人满意的解释。

Langley cleared his throat. Now was not the time to think about that. He gestured to the bed.  
兰利清了清嗓子。现在不是想这些的时候。他示意了一下床。

"Mind if I sit down?"  
“介意我坐下吗？”

Asuka stubbornly refused to make eye contact with him, only nodding. He sat down on the bed and gestured for her to do the same. She obeyed, still not looking at him.  
明日香固执地拒绝与他眼神接触，只是点了点头。他坐在床上，示意她也坐下。她顺从了，依旧没有看他。

"Asuka, did you forget the No-Japanese-at-home rule?"  
“明日香，你忘了家里不讲日语的规矩吗？”

Asuka didn't give any sign that she heard him. He gritted his teeth. His patience was wearing thin. Just as he wondered if he should order her to look at him, Asuka finally lifted her head and looked straight at him, a murderous fire flashing in those blue eyes that so resembled his own. It startled him. By his standards, this was an unacceptable kind of face for a daughter to make toward her father, but Asuka opened her mouth before he could scold her.  
明日香没有任何迹象表明她听到了他的话。他咬紧牙关，耐心正在逐渐耗尽。正当他考虑是否应该命令她看着他时，明日香终于抬起头，直视着他，那双与他如此相似的蓝眼睛中闪过一丝杀意。这让他吃了一惊。按照他的标准，女儿对父亲做出这样的表情是不可接受的，但明日香在他责备之前就开口了。

"Why can't I use a language I'm comfortable with? Why are you telling me I can't use the language Mama used? Why are you trying to erase Mama like that?" All of this was said in rapid Japanese. Her eyes didn't leave his once.  
"为什么我不能用我熟悉的语言？为什么你要告诉我不能用妈妈用的语言？为什么你要这样抹去妈妈的存在？" 她一口气用日语说出了这些话，目光始终没有离开他。

All thoughts of reprimanding her vanished from his mind at her words. An old guilt, long buried, flared up abruptly, and he didn't know what to do about it. Maybe this was the real reason behind Asuka's stubbornness, he realized. Whatever led to the fight between her and Emma was likely superficial and meaningless. He sighed, feeling stupid for not getting it earlier.  
听到她的话，他心中原本想要责备她的念头瞬间消失。一种久已埋藏的愧疚突然涌上心头，让他不知所措。也许这才是明日香固执的真正原因，他意识到。无论她和艾玛之间的争执因何而起，很可能都是表面且无意义的。他叹了口气，觉得自己之前没能理解真是愚蠢。

"Asuka, it's not like that."  
"明日香，不是那样的。"

"Then-" "那么——"

He raised his hand to silence her. Asuka's face contorted even further, but he didn't feel the least bit sorry for her. It was an adult's duty to stop children before they, with their juvenile emotions, said something that everyone would regret later, and that 'everyone' included the children themselves. So this was all for her sake, after all.  
他举手示意她安静。明日香的脸扭曲得更厉害了，但他对她没有丝毫歉意。阻止孩子们在幼稚的情绪驱使下说出日后大家都会后悔的话，是成年人的责任，而那个'大家'也包括孩子们自己。所以，毕竟这一切都是为了她好。

"I…" he began, and then cleared his throat and gathered his thoughts once more. The idea of having to defend his decisions to his own daughter was foreign to him, and he wasn't particularly prepared for it. "I've been speaking English longer than you've been alive, Asuka. It's also the language my late mother spoke, and I miss her too, the same way you miss yours. But have you ever heard me speak English at home?"  
"我……"他开口道，然后清了清嗓子，重新整理思绪。要向自己的女儿解释自己的决定，对他来说是件陌生的事，他并没有特别准备好。"我讲英语的时间比你活的时间还长，明日香。那也是我已故母亲说的语言，我也像你思念你母亲一样思念她。但你可曾听过我在家里说英语？"

Asuka's eyes narrowed. "Why don't you? Just speak it."  
明日香的眼神变得锐利。“为什么不呢？直接说出来。”

He laughed softly and shook his head. Her response was so predictable, down to her choice of words.  
他轻声笑了笑，摇了摇头。她的回答如此可预测，连用词都如出一辙。

"I don't, Asuka, because I don't want anyone in my family to feel left out in their own home. It was the same when your mother was around, and it's the same now. Wouldn't you feel confused if I suddenly started saying words you and Emma didn't understand?" Langley took a deep breath. "Like so," he said in English, letting the heavy Texan drawl of his youth color his words. "Trust me, Asuka, whatever version of English they're teachin' you in school pry ain't near the same as mine."  
“我不说，明日香，因为我不想让家里的任何人感到在自己家中被排除在外。你母亲在的时候是这样，现在也是这样。如果我突然开始说你和艾玛不懂的话，你不会感到困惑吗？”兰利深吸了一口气。“就像这样，”他用英语说道，让年轻时的浓重德州口音为他的话语增色。“相信我，明日香，学校教你的英语版本恐怕跟我说的差远了。”

Asuka frowned at him, clearly not quite managing to wrap her head around what he just said. His next words were back in German. "Or worse, what if I said something only Emma and I could understand and you had to sit there and listen to it, wondering what was going on?"  
"明日香皱着眉头看他，显然还没完全理解他刚才说的话。他的下一句话又换成了德语。“或者更糟，如果我说了只有艾玛和我能懂的话，你只能坐在那里听着，不知道发生了什么，怎么办？””

Asuka looked down at the floor, pouting. "I wouldn't care unless you're talking to me directly. It's none of my business. I don't like it when people stick their noses into other people's business."  
"明日香低头看着地板，噘着嘴。“除非你直接跟我说话，否则我才不在乎。这不关我的事。我不喜欢别人多管闲事。””

Langley smiled helplessly. This, too, was something he'd been able to deduce from his call with Emma.  
兰格无奈地笑了。这一点，他也是从和艾玛的通话中推断出来的。

"Is that really what you did, minding your own business?"  
"你真的只是在忙自己的事吗？"

Asuka's head snapped up. "I was on the phone with Misato! Do I really need to be interrupted every time I speak Japanese with a Japanese person?"  
明日香猛地抬起头。“我刚才在和美里通电话！难道每次我和日本人讲日语都得被打断吗？”

It was the first time she spoke German since Langley entered the room. It was likely just the more familiar language popping up out of anger rather than Asuka respecting the rules, but nonetheless, it was an improvement, he supposed. He had other questions to ask now anyway.  
这是自兰格利进入房间以来，她第一次说德语。或许只是因为愤怒而脱口而出更熟悉的语言，而不是明日香遵守规则，但无论如何，他认为这是个进步。反正他现在还有其他问题要问。

"Who is this Misato? A school friend?" He had never heard of any Japanese students or staff at Asuka's school. Well, come to think of it, he didn't know much about her school at all, but he was reasonably certain that it wasn't a place for Asians. How fortunate that his daughter was completely white-passing, at least on the surface.  
"这位美里是谁？是学校的同学吗？" 他从未听说过明日香学校里有日本学生或教职工。嗯，仔细想想，他对她的学校了解甚少，但他相当确定那不是一个亚洲人聚集的地方。幸运的是，他的女儿在外表上完全是个白人。

"My handler. NERV. Promoted to lieutenant recently."  
"我的联络人。NERV。最近刚晋升为中尉。"

"So, what did you and the Lieutenant talk about in Japanese?"  
"那么，你和这位中尉用日语聊了些什么？"

"Just NERV business and stuff. About her promotion. I congratulated her."  
“只是 NERV 的事务和一些琐事。关于她的晋升。我向她表示了祝贺。”

He didn't miss the slight flicker in Asuka's eyes. "And?"  
他没错过明日香眼中那一闪而过的微妙变化。“然后呢？”

Fortunately, his daughter didn't lie. If she had, it would have become embarrassing for both of them. Instead, Asuka closed her mouth and looked away again. Langley gave her a stern look.  
幸运的是，他的女儿没有撒谎。如果她撒了谎，那将会让他们两人都感到尴尬。相反，明日香闭上了嘴，再次将目光移开。兰格雷严肃地看了她一眼。

"I heard you talked about Emma. Can you tell me what you said?"  
"我听说你谈到了艾玛。能告诉我你说了什么吗？"

"If you heard it all, why are you asking?"  
"如果你都听到了，为什么还要问？"

"I want to hear your side of the story."  
"我想听听你的说法。"

"I don't." Asuka snorted. "She doesn't even speak Japanese but somehow catches swearing when it's about her, I guess."  
"我不懂。" 明日香哼了一声。"她连日语都不会说，但不知怎么的，一提到她，脏话她就能听懂了。"

"Asuka-" "明日香——"

"If she doesn't like me calling her names, then why doesn't she say so? Why does she just bring up stupid rules and stuff and then call her husband crying when things don't go her way?" Asuka snorted contemptuously. "She's such a _child."_  
"如果她不喜欢我叫她名字，那为什么不直接说出来？为什么她总是搬出那些愚蠢的规则，然后事情不如她意时就哭着给她丈夫打电话？" 明日香轻蔑地哼了一声。"她真是个孩子。"

Langley was at a loss for words. Such things coming out of the mouth of a ten-year-old were shockingly incongruent with her appearance. His daughter was clearly precocious, he always knew that, but the cold confirmation of the fact was like a bucket of ice water to the face. He resisted the urge to shake his head.  
兰格利无言以对。一个十岁孩子嘴里说出这样的话，与她的外表极不相称，令人震惊。他一直知道自己的女儿早熟，但这个冷酷的事实确认就像一盆冰水浇在脸上。他强忍住摇头的冲动。

"Emma's trying", he said, after a pause that stretched for far too long. "She understood what you were saying on the phone because she's been studying Japanese for you. She was just too embarrassed by what you said. That's why she pretended to not understand and tried to resolve the matter in a different way."  
"艾玛在努力", 他停顿了许久后说道。"她之所以能听懂你在电话里说的话，是因为她一直在为你学习日语。她只是对你说的话感到太尴尬了。这就是为什么她假装听不懂，并试图用另一种方式解决问题。"

"For me? She's doing it so she can eavesdrop on what I'm saying! She did that today! What a schwein!"  
"为了我？她这么做是为了偷听我在说什么！她今天就这么干了！真是个混蛋！"

Langley raised hands to grip Asuka's shoulders tightly, turning her in his direction. He felt heat rising in his face.  
兰利举起双手紧紧抓住明日香的肩膀，将她转向自己。他感到脸上热气腾腾。

"Asuka, Emma is my wife and your stepmother. Whether you like it or not, that fact isn't changing. There's a level of respect that must be maintained in such a relationship. Why are you letting me down like this?"  
"明日香，艾玛是我的妻子，也是你的继母。无论你是否喜欢，这个事实都不会改变。在这种关系中，必须保持一定的尊重。你为什么要这样让我失望？"

A brief flicker of fear passed through Asuka's eyes. A healthy fear of her father, something she seemed to have forgotten lately, had returned. But it was short-lived, and those eyes burned with defiance once again.  
明日香眼中闪过一丝恐惧。对父亲的敬畏，最近似乎被她遗忘了，此刻又回来了。但这种感觉转瞬即逝，她的眼神再次燃起了反抗的火焰。

"Respect, you say. Then why doesn't she respect me? She's not my mother. Is she supposed to yell at me?"  
"你说尊重。那她为什么不尊重我？她不是我的母亲。她难道应该对我大吼大叫吗？"

Langley heard it all from Emma, too. She was an honest woman and he appreciated it. He sighed.  
兰利也从艾玛那里听说了这一切。她是个诚实的人，他对此心存感激。他叹了口气。

"It's true that she lost her temper. She shouldn't have said those things to you. I'm not defending that. She's an adult and should have known better. All I'm asking, Asuka, is for everyone to just stop fighting and get along a little bit. You two live together and see each other every day, and that situation is not changing anytime soon, so why not make peace? Wouldn't that be easier for you too?"  
“她的确发了脾气，不该对你说那些话。我并非为她辩解，她是个成年人，理应更懂得分寸。我只是在请求，明日香，大家能否停止争斗，稍微和睦相处。你们俩同住一个屋檐下，每天都会见面，这种情况短期内不会改变，何不和解呢？对你来说，这样不也更轻松吗？”

Asuka didn't answer. As Langley stared at those stubbornly closed lips and those blazing eyes, fatigue overwhelmed him.  
明日香没有回答。兰利凝视着她那固执紧闭的双唇和炽热的眼神，感到一阵疲惫袭来。

He was so, so tired. Perhaps because of that fatigue, he lost control for a moment and gave voice to the terrible fear that had always plagued his mind.  
他疲惫至极。或许正是这份疲倦，让他一时失控，将那始终萦绕心头的可怕恐惧宣之于口。

"It must be all my fault, Asuka. It's all my fault."  
“一定都是我的错，明日香。都是我的错。”

"...Papa?" “……爸爸？”

He pressed both hands to his temples. "After what happened to your mother, I was the only one you had. So who else can we blame for the way you turned out? It's all my fault. For making you like this. For putting you in this situation. For everything."  
他双手按住太阳穴。“在你母亲出事后，我是你唯一的依靠。那么我们还能怪谁让你变成这样呢？都是我的错。是我让你变成这样。是我让你陷入这种境地。一切都是我的错。”

Asuka's eyes widened. Her tiny mouth was slightly agape. Before he could say another word, her shoulders trembled and she lowered her head. She whimpered. The sound was loud in the quiet room.  
明日香瞪大了眼睛，她的小嘴微微张开。还没等他再说什么，她的肩膀开始颤抖，头也低了下来。她发出了一声呜咽，在这寂静的房间里显得格外响亮。

"Papa..." “爸爸……”

Her voice was so pitiful that Langley had to ask himself if he'd made a mistake. He pulled Asuka into a hug, feeling a lump in his throat.  
她的声音如此可怜，以至于兰利不得不问自己是否犯了错。他紧紧抱住明日香，喉咙里哽咽着。

The body trembling in his arms was so tiny, so fragile. It reminded him of how young his daughter was. They were planning to send her off to university next year.  
在他怀中颤抖的身体是如此娇小，如此脆弱。这让他想起了女儿是多么年轻。他们计划明年送她去上大学。

"Papa... I'll do better. I can do better."  
“爸爸...我会做得更好。我能做得更好。”

If it weren't for certain social norms that had been drilled into his head relentlessly, he would have broken down and cried right then. It was at moments like these that he was overcome with doubt. Doubt in himself. In his faith in God. They said that those who were to become an instrument of the Lord were first given trials that normal people could not endure, but even if he accepted that logic, he doubted there was really a mission in the world that would justify the pain his girl has gone through. He wanted to cry and tell her that it really wasn't her fault, that all the blame could be placed on this weak sinner's shoulders. But he couldn't. He was the rock of this house, the one who was supposed to stand firm, the one others relied on.  
如果不是某些社会规范无休止地灌输进他的脑海，他当时就会崩溃哭泣。正是在这样的时刻，他充满了怀疑。对自己，对上帝的信仰。他们说，那些将成为上帝工具的人首先要经历常人无法忍受的考验，但即便他接受了这种逻辑，他也怀疑世界上是否真的有某种使命能证明他女儿所受的痛苦是合理的。他想哭着告诉她，这真的不是她的错，所有的责备都可以归咎于这个软弱的罪人身上。但他不能。他是这个家的支柱，是应该坚定不移的人，是别人依赖的人。

So, as he quietly stroked his daughter's hair, he prayed for her, silently.  
因此，当他静静地抚摸着女儿的头发时，他在心中默默为她祈祷。

And he would do the same tonight, and all the nights to come.  
今晚，以及未来的每一个夜晚，他都会这样做。

### Chapter 13 Angel of the sky

As soon as the elevator doors closed behind her, Asuka pulled out her compact mirror and scrutinized her reflection. She'd already done so several times today, but something could have fallen out of place during her walk home. She smoothed her hair, eyes narrowed.  
电梯门刚在她身后合上，明日香便掏出小镜子，仔细端详起自己的倒影。今天她已经这样检查过好几次了，但回家的路上或许有什么地方走样了。她抚平头发，眯起眼睛。

The girl in the mirror looked perfect. Pretty. As always.  
镜中的女孩看起来完美无瑕。漂亮。一如既往。

"Damn, girl. I think you've gotten even prettier lately. How's that even possible? Jeez." One of the girls at school - Maki, probably - had said this while they were all sitting together and eating bentos. Asuka's was the product of her and Shinji's joint effort. They'd been cooking together more and more often lately. He stayed back home, the suspension still not over, but promised to eat Asuka's food for lunch.  
“该死，女孩。我觉得你最近变得更漂亮了。这怎么可能？天哪。”学校里的一个女孩——大概是 Maki——在他们一起吃便当时这样说道。明日香的便当是她与真嗣共同努力的成果。最近他们一起做饭的次数越来越多。真嗣仍被停学在家，但承诺会吃明日香做的午餐。

That particular exchange had happened on Wednesday. When the burn of their first kiss was still fresh on her lips. The heat of it was prolonged by many more kisses that followed. Asuka was already used to the other girls' incessant flattery, but that particular comment flustered her.  
那次特别的对话发生在周三。当他们第一次亲吻的余温还残留在她的唇上时。随之而来的更多吻延长了那份热度。明日香已经习惯了其他女孩不断的赞美，但那次特别的评论让她有些慌乱。

"What are you talking about? I'm always pretty." Asuka replied, masking her discomfort by fumbling at the lid of her bento. Everyone laughed.  
"你在说什么呢？我一直都很漂亮。" 明日香回答道，通过摆弄便当盒的盖子来掩饰她的不适。大家都笑了。

But Maki didn't want to let the topic go. When the laughter died down, she leaned toward Asuka. "But, Asuka, I'm serious. You're practically glowing these days. Something's changed."  
但真希不想就此打住。当笑声平息后，她向明日香倾身过去。"但，明日香，我是认真的。你最近简直容光焕发。一定有什么变化。"

Asuka sat still with her lips slightly parted, unable to come up with a reply. Then Keiko came to her rescue. "Skincare? Diet change?"  
明日香静静地坐着，双唇微张，无法想出回答。这时，惠子来帮她解围了。"护肤？饮食改变？"

"It's probably diet," said another girl whose name Asuka couldn't remember. "You see, I quit eating pizza last semester and it did wonders for my skin."  
"可能是节食吧，"另一个女孩说道，她的名字明日香记不得了。"你看，我上学期就不吃披萨了，对我的皮肤大有好处。"

Maki giggled at that. "I wish I had someone to cook for me and pack me a lunch. Maybe that would make me glow like Asuka! What is Ikari feeding you these days?"  
真希听到这话笑了起来。"要是我也有人给我做饭、给我准备午餐就好了。那样我也能像明日香一样光彩照人了！最近碇在给你吃什么呢？"

_His spit_. Turning her face to her bento to hide her blush, Asuka had mumbled something indistinct. She was lucky Hikari wasn't there to notice. The Class Rep was eating with Suzuhara these days, their relationship all but official.  
他的口水。明日香把脸转向便当，试图掩饰自己的脸红，含糊地嘟囔了些什么。幸好班长没在，不然她肯定会注意到。最近班长和铃原一起吃饭，他们的关系几乎已经公开了。

The memory brought heat to Asuka's face again and put butterflies in her stomach. Asuka cupped her cheek with the hand that had been running through her hair. It felt cool against her face.  
回忆再次让明日香的脸颊发热，心中涌起一阵悸动。明日香用抚过发丝的手轻捧脸颊，感觉凉意在脸上蔓延。

They kissed whenever they had the slightest chance. Shyly, hesitantly at first, then a little bolder as time went by. Each time was as exciting as the last. Asuka could feel her heart fluttering in anticipation. Surprisingly (or perhaps not so), it was Shinji who took the lead more often than not. Just like he was the first to use tongue. Honestly, Asuka wasn't one hundred percent sure what to make of this change in his behavior.  
他们一有机会就亲吻，起初羞涩而犹豫，随着时间的推移逐渐大胆起来。每一次都如上次般令人兴奋。明日香能感受到心跳加速的期待。出乎意料（或许也不那么意外），多半是真嗣主动引领。就像他第一次伸出舌头那样。说实话，明日香对他在行为上的这种转变并不完全确定该如何看待。

Of course, that didn't mean Shinji was overbearing. He was still Shinji. He hadn't tried to get too physical with her since that first time, much to her chagrin. Instead, Asuka, sensing a chance, would look at Shinji, and he'd look back at her, and then they'd slip off to some quiet corner of the apartment.  
当然，这并不意味着真嗣变得霸道。他依旧是真嗣。自那次之后，他并未再试图与她过于亲密，这让她有些失望。相反，明日香察觉到机会时，会看向真嗣，他也会回望她，然后两人便悄悄溜到公寓的某个安静角落。

This was a side of Shinji that she'd never seen before, a side she never would have guessed he possessed. The looks he gave her pierced her body like a javelin with their scalding intensity, a sharp and jarring contrast to their usual soft shyness. It made him seem older, somehow, and that put Asuka off-balance. Whenever he looked at her with those heavy eyes, it sent a bolt of electricity arcing through her, stronger than anything she'd ever felt. It made the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end and her limbs feel almost numb. The raw, naked desire with which he kissed her afterwards made her wonder if she should put up a token resistance, but then Shinji's hands would grip her roughly and her knees turned to jelly. He was stronger than he looked.  
这是她从未见过的真嗣的一面，一个她从未料想他会拥有的侧面。他投向她的目光如标枪般炽热而锐利，与平日里羞涩柔和的眼神形成鲜明对比，令他显得莫名成熟，让明日香感到措手不及。每当他用那双沉重的眼睛凝视她时，都会有一股电流贯穿全身，比她以往任何感受都要强烈，令她后颈的毛发竖立，四肢近乎麻木。随后，他那赤裸裸、不加掩饰的渴望之吻让她怀疑是否该象征性地抵抗一下，但紧接着真嗣粗暴地握住她的手，她的膝盖便软如凝胶。他比外表看起来要强壮得多。

It was almost surreal. There she was, moaning and whimpering like a damsel in distress, not just in anyone's arms, but Idiot Shinji's, trembling beneath his ministrations. In a way, it was disgusting, both figuratively and literally. They called it _kissing,_ but it was more them mashing their open mouths together, tongues tangling and licking whatever they could reach, breath and spit mingling to the point she couldn't tell whose was whose.  
这一切几乎如梦似幻。她就在那里，像一位陷入困境的少女般呻吟啜泣，不是在任何人的怀抱中，而是在那个笨蛋真嗣的臂弯里，因他的抚慰而颤抖。从某种角度来说，这既令人作呕，也确实恶心。他们称之为接吻，但实际上更像是将张开的嘴紧紧贴合，舌头交缠，舔舐着所能触及的一切，呼吸与唾液交织到她已无法分辨彼此。

What she couldn't understand was that all those things didn't _feel_ disgusting at all in the moment. Quite the opposite, actually. When Shinji's body pressed hers against the wall, when drool escaped their joined mouths, Asuka didn't feel repulsed. Rather, she just wanted it to go on forever. It was only later, when she was alone, or when she was lying nude on her bed basking in the afterglow of masturbation, that she became fully aware of the absurdity of her actions. And how seriously disgusting they objectively were. The fact that she didn't find them disgusting disgusted her even more. She grimaced. There were _layers_ to this. It was like a great big lasagna of disgust that for some incomprehensible reason was the most appetizing thing in the world.  
她无法理解的是，那些行为在当下丝毫没有让她感到恶心。实际上，恰恰相反。当真嗣的身体将她压在墙上，当口水从他们紧贴的唇间溢出时，明日香并没有感到厌恶。相反，她只希望这一刻能永远持续下去。只有在后来，当她独自一人，或是赤裸地躺在床上享受自慰后的余韵时，她才完全意识到自己行为的荒谬。以及它们在客观上有多么令人作呕。她不觉得这些行为恶心，这一点反而让她更加厌恶。她皱起了眉头。这其中有着层层叠叠的复杂情感。就像是一大块难以理解的令人作呕的千层面，不知为何却成了世界上最诱人的东西。

And yet, despite everything, she found herself constantly fantasizing about Shinji when they were apart. Eagerly wondering how far he'd go this time, where he would touch her next, only to be disappointed that the boy's boldness had apparently peaked with their first kiss.  
尽管如此，尽管一切，她发现自己总是在他们分开时不断幻想真嗣。热切地想知道这次他会做到什么程度，下一次他会触碰她哪里，结果却失望地发现，那个男孩的大胆似乎在他们的初吻时就达到了顶峰。

Even now, Asuka was wondering what exactly would push Shinji to be that bold again. Maybe she had to be the one to push him. Her lips quirked upward into a smirk. She wanted to feel the undeniable proof of his desire for her grinding against her again. When he'd done it the first time, all she could think of was how much she'd wanted _more._ How much she'd wanted to make the layers of fabric separating them disappear, how much she'd wanted to go all the way. It didn't matter that they'd only been on a single date. They'd been living together for _months._ She had known him for even less time when she'd proclaimed Misato's flimsy paper door to be the Wall of Jericho. If he'd understood her hint then and torn down the barrier and pinned her down, she would have wrapped her legs around his waist and…  
即便此刻，明日香仍在思索究竟是什么能让真嗣再次如此大胆。或许她得亲自推他一把。她的唇角微微上扬，露出一丝狡黠的笑意。她渴望再次感受到他那不容置疑的欲望紧贴着自己的身体。当他第一次这样做时，她满脑子想的都是她多么渴望更多。她多么希望他们之间那层层的布料消失，多么希望彻底拥有他。尽管他们只约会过一次，但这无关紧要。他们已经同居数月。当她宣称美里那扇薄薄的纸门为耶利哥之墙时，她认识他的时间更短。如果当时他理解了她的暗示，摧毁了那道屏障并将她按倒，她会紧紧缠住他的腰……

Asuka forcibly cut off her wild train of thought. Her legs were already trembling involuntarily, thighs rubbing each other. A sigh escaped her mouth.  
明日香强行截断了这狂野的思绪。她的双腿已不由自主地颤抖，大腿相互摩擦。她叹了口气。

"What the hell happened to me?"  
“我到底是怎么了？”

Muttering to herself, Asuka pulled her cell phone out. There was a text message, under the name _Third Child_. A reply to the text Asuka had sent earlier.  
自言自语着，明日香掏出了手机。屏幕上显示着一条来自“第三适格者”的短信。这是对明日香之前发送的短信的回复。

_Yeah, come right away. Lunch is ready and waiting. Ms. Misato has a dinner appointment again, by the way.  
嗯，快来吧。午饭已经准备好了，在等你。顺便说一句，美里小姐今晚又有晚餐约会了。_

The short text was oozing with anticipation and it gave Asuka another tingle. Her thighs clenched together again. The idiot was _really_ not helping.  
这条简短的短信充满了期待，让明日香又感到一阵颤栗。她的大腿不由自主地紧绷起来。这个笨蛋真是让人没办法。

Gritting her teeth slightly, she turned to the mirror again. She found a face that was both familiar and unfamiliar. It was definitely her face, features unchanged from the last month, but something about it was different. Asuka realized that Maki wasn't wrong. She obsessively studied her reflection, but she couldn't pinpoint exactly what had changed. Flushed cheeks. Soft, smiling eyes. Slightly curled up lips. Nothing unusual. It's not like she never smiled. But somehow the overall impression had changed.  
她微微咬紧牙关，再次转向镜子。她看到了一张既熟悉又陌生的脸。那无疑是她的脸，与上个月相比特征未变，但某些地方却有所不同。明日香意识到真希并没有错。她痴迷地审视着自己的倒影，却无法准确指出究竟是哪里变了。泛红的脸颊。柔和、含笑的眼睛。微微上扬的唇角。并无异常。她并非从不微笑。但不知为何，整体感觉已然改变。

_It's because I'm happy_, she thought suddenly. But it was strange. Wrong, even. Yes, she liked the boy, but it was almost humiliating that he was able to affect her feelings this much. Anger, until recently. Happiness, now. Both directly caused by him. Was it right for the mind of the great Asuka Langley Soryu to be this obsessed with one silly boy? It wasn't like she was completely unhappy and miserable until she started dating Shinji.  
因为她感到快乐，她突然想到。但这很奇怪，甚至不对劲。是的，她喜欢那个男孩，但他能如此强烈地影响她的情绪，几乎让她感到羞愧。愤怒，直到不久前。现在则是快乐。两者都直接由他引发。伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷的内心，真的应该如此沉迷于一个愚蠢的男孩吗？在她开始和真嗣交往之前，她并非完全不快乐和悲惨。

Just as her thoughts reached that point, the elevator stopped. Asuka cleared her throat and checked herself in the mirror one last time. Despite what was going on inside her head, the girl in the mirror was smiling softly, so innocently happy to return to the home where someone was waiting for her.  
就在她的思绪到达这一点时，电梯停了下来。明日香清了清嗓子，最后一次在镜中审视自己。尽管内心波涛汹涌，镜中的女孩却温柔地微笑着，如此天真无邪地期待回到那个有人在等她的家。

The smile turned bitter as she snapped the mirror shut.  
当她啪的一声合上镜子时，笑容变得苦涩。

_You're just overcomplicating things again, Asuka,_ she muttered silently. _He's yours. Nothing's going to change that now. The boy's yours. You can do whatever you want, at your own pace. You were the one who thought there was no point in rushing things, remember?_  
你又在把事情复杂化，明日香，她默默地自言自语。他是你的。现在什么都不会改变这一点。那男孩是你的。你可以按照自己的节奏做任何你想做的事。是你自己认为没必要急于求成，记得吗？

Walking down the hallway that led to home, Asuka untied the ribbon of her blouse and opened the top two buttons. Her slightly reddened face was full of mischief by the time she reached the door.  
走在通往家的走廊上，明日香解开了衬衫的丝带，并解开了最上面的两颗扣子。当她走到门口时，她那微微泛红的脸颊上满是调皮的神情。

---

It went exactly as she expected. His hand went straight to her breasts. She would have laughed if her lips weren't fully swallowed by his hot, hungry mouth. One of her hands tried to push him away, and was rewarded by a vise-like grip on her wrist, something she also expected to happen. The whole thing was like an old familiar dance, both of them knowing exactly what to expect and yet still finding the thing irresistible. Even now, the rational part of her mind was warning her that she should stop, but the tongue that was scraping the inside of her mouth was like anesthetic, putting her into a dazed state she couldn't quite escape. Truthfully, she didn't really want to.  
一切正如她所料。他的手直接伸向了她的胸部。如果她的嘴唇没有被他那炽热而饥渴的嘴完全吞没，她本会笑出声来。她的一只手试图推开他，却换来了手腕上如铁钳般的紧握，这也是她预料之中的。整个过程就像一支熟悉的旧舞曲，两人都清楚对方会如何反应，却依然无法抗拒这诱惑。即便此刻，她理智的那部分在警告她应该停下来，但那在她口中游走的舌头却如同麻醉剂，让她陷入了一种难以逃脱的恍惚状态。说实话，她并不真的想逃脱。

A loud buzz from her cell phone made Misato finally come to her senses. She pushed Kaji away. He quickly returned to the driver's seat, settling back into the chair. Misato ran a hand through her messy hair while using the other to pull out the phone. Coldness sluiced through her veins at the sight of the short, simple message on the screen.  
一阵刺耳的手机铃声终于让美里回过神来。她推开了加持。他迅速回到驾驶座，重新坐定。美里一边用手梳理着凌乱的头发，一边用另一只手掏出手机。屏幕上简短而直接的信息让她感到一股寒意直透脊髓。

"It's an emergency call. Need to report to H.Q ASAP."  
“紧急召集。需立即前往总部报到。”

She coughed and cleared her throat, because her voice was surprisingly raspy. Kaji made a thoughtful noise.  
她咳嗽了几声，清了清嗓子，因为她的声音出奇地沙哑。加持发出了一声沉思的低吟。

"At ten o'clock? Did they tell you the reason?"  
"十点钟？他们告诉你原因了吗？"

Misato narrowed her eyes and looked at Kaji sideways. He was staring out the front windshield nonchalantly, as if his question was purely innocent and the answer wasn't going to be passed on to some godforsaken contact later. Misato briefly considered lying, but that would be as meaningful as refusing a kiss after agreeing to a car date by the lakeshore after dinner. A sigh escaped her mouth.  
美里眯起眼睛，斜睨着加持。他若无其事地盯着前挡风玻璃，仿佛他的问题纯粹出于好奇，而答案并不会在稍后传给某个倒霉的联系人。美里短暂地考虑了一下撒谎，但那就像是在同意湖边晚餐后的车载约会后，又拒绝一个吻一样毫无意义。她叹了口气。

"No. Just demanding to appear at once."  
"没有。只是要求立刻出现。"

"Which could only mean..."  
"那只能意味着..."

Misato snorted, slipping the phone into her pocket again.  
美里哼了一声，再次将手机塞进口袋。

"They're not about to let anyone overindulge, I guess. Have to throw something at us semi-periodically."  
"他们大概不会让任何人过度放纵吧。得时不时给我们来点小刺激。"

Kaji let out a small laugh. "I don't even think we enjoyed ourselves that much."  
加治轻声笑了出来。“我甚至不觉得我们当时玩得那么尽兴。”

Misato smiled grimly at that. What she just said wasn't entirely about her and Kaji. She thought of the two kids back at her house who were attached at the mouth whenever Misato looked the other way.  
美里对此苦笑了一下。她刚才的话并不完全是指自己和加治。她想起了家里那两个孩子，每当美里不注意时，他们总是黏在一起亲吻。

It had been an awkward week. Misato was well aware of what those kids were doing, even if they thought they were being sneaky. Section 2 had been reporting their every move with an almost malicious meticulousness, and thanks to that, as of last Monday Misato knew the minute by minute route of Asuka and Shinji's first date. On Tuesday and Thursday, grocery shopping, hands clasped together. Now with Shinji's suspension ending, their outdoor activities would likely become more overt and frequent.  
这一周过得颇为尴尬。美里很清楚那两个孩子在做什么，即使他们自以为行事隐秘。第二支部几乎以一种近乎恶意的细致报告了他们的每一个动作，因此，从上周一开始，美里就详细掌握了明日香和真嗣第一次约会的每分每秒的路线。周二和周四，他们手牵手去购物。现在随着真嗣的停职结束，他们的户外活动可能会变得更加公开和频繁。

In truth, Misato didn't even need a series of photos with timestamps and notes to know what was up with the kids. Asuka had made the announcement in the first place, and neither of them had made much of an effort to hide that they were cooked side by side in the kitchen, and at night Misato heard them talking in soft voices in Asuka's room.  
实际上，美里根本不需要一系列带有时间戳和笔记的照片来了解孩子们的情况。是明日香首先宣布的，而且他们俩都没有太努力去隐藏他们在厨房里并肩烹饪的事实，晚上美里还能听到他们在明日香的房间里轻声交谈。

Misato just shrugged it all off, pretending to not notice anything. One time, she had gone to bed early after several consecutive night shifts. She'd woken up thirsty at eleven PM, but the kitchen lights were still on. When she peered around the doorframe, she was greeted by the sight of Asuka and Shinji hugging each other tightly and attempting to devour each other's faces. She grimaced and silently went back to her room.  
美里只是耸耸肩，假装什么都没注意到。有一次，她连续几个夜班后早早去睡觉了。晚上十一点，她醒来口渴，但厨房的灯还亮着。当她从门框边窥视时，看到明日香和真嗣紧紧拥抱在一起，试图吞噬对方的脸。她皱了皱眉，默默地回到自己的房间。

This subject was almost untouchable with Asuka, and Shinji kept deflecting Misato's few attempts to talk about their budding relationship. Admittedly, she wasn't trying very hard. She wasn't sure what to tell them. Advice? A warning? She felt that nothing she could say would make a difference in the end.  
这个话题对明日香来说几乎是碰不得的，而真嗣也一直回避美里试图谈论他们萌芽关系的几次尝试。说实在的，她并没有太努力。她不确定该对他们说什么。建议？警告？她觉得无论她说什么，最终都不会有什么影响。

_Who am I to tell someone else what to do on that subjec_t_?_ Perhaps because of that, the Katsuragi household had come to an unspoken agreement this past week. Misato knew everything that went on between them, and they both knew that Misato knew. They would hopefully not cross the line, and in return, Misato would not say anything, and stay away from home as much as possible to prevent awkward situations.  
我有什么资格对别人在这件事上指手画脚呢？或许正因为如此，上周开始，葛城家已经达成了某种不言而喻的共识。美里对他们的所有事情了如指掌，而他们也心知肚明美里知道一切。他们希望不会越界，作为交换，美里不会多言，并尽可能减少在家的时间，以避免尴尬的局面。

Maybe the last part was all just an excuse. An excuse to abandon her responsibilities and indulge herself. The uneasy peace she'd gotten from doing so. Fleeting pleasure that she knew from the start would end abruptly.  
也许最后那部分只是借口。一个逃避责任、放纵自己的借口。她从中获得的短暂安宁。从一开始就知道会突然结束的短暂欢愉。

Misato tried to suppress her rising dread. This was not the end of the world. Just her nasty old habit of doubting the possibility of happiness. It was only an Angel. It was a ridiculous statement to some degree, but it was true. They had three fully functioning and armed Evangelions plus an almost fully functioning defense grid. At this point, NERV and Misato could not have asked for a more complete defense against an Angel's attack even if they tried.  
美里试图压制不断升起的恐惧。这并不是世界末日。只是她那令人厌恶的老毛病，怀疑幸福的可能性。这不过是一个使徒。在某种程度上，这是一个荒谬的说法，但却是事实。他们有三台完全运作并装备齐全的 EVA，加上几乎完全运作的防御网。此时此刻，NERV 和美里无法再要求更完善的防御来对抗使徒的攻击了，哪怕他们尽力去争取。

She felt Kaji's eyes on her. She must have shown too much open anxiety. Misato shook her head and started to rise. "I'll go."  
她感觉到加持在注视着她。她一定表现得太过明显了。美里摇了摇头，开始起身。“我去。”

Misato was halfway out the door when Kaji's hand reached out and grabbed her wrist. She gave him a questioning glance. The orange light that came on when the door opened cast a deep shadow across Kaji's brow. His other hand was clasped around the steering wheel, a cell phone in it. A different model than the one she had seen earlier today. A chill ran down her spine as she realized what it implied.  
美里刚走到门口一半，加持的手伸出来抓住了她的手腕。她疑惑地看了他一眼。门打开时亮起的橙色灯光在加持的眉间投下深深的阴影。他的另一只手紧握着方向盘，手里拿着一部手机。与今天早些时候她见过的那部不同型号。她意识到这背后的含义，脊背一阵发凉。

"Let's go together," he said.  
“我们一起去吧，”他说。

Misato swallowed hard, her spit still thick after the kiss, and pointed to Kaji's phone. "I don't think you got an invitation."  
美里艰难地咽了咽，亲吻后的唾液依旧浓稠，她指向加持的手机。“我觉得你没收到邀请。”

"I'm a UN inspector. I can invite myself anywhere."  
“我是联合国调查员。我可以随时邀请自己。”

"I doubt that." “我对此表示怀疑。”

"I doubt your doubt." "我怀疑你的怀疑。"

Misato shook her head. She wasn't about to engage in pointless bickering. "You can tell that to the Commander. Besides, I don't want to be seen walking in with you. Ride to the base on your own. I'll take a cab to the station."  
美里摇了摇头。她不打算陷入无谓的争吵。“你可以跟司令说去。再说了，我不想被人看到和你一起走进去。你自己骑车去基地吧。我会打车去车站。”

The corners of Kaji's mouth curled up slightly into his trademark roguish smile. It was the kind of smile that said _I know something you don't and it's the most hilarious thing in the world._ That look on Kaji's face usually sent shivers down her spine and made her tingle everywhere, but at times like this, she couldn't think of anything she hated more.  
加持的嘴角微微上扬，露出了他那标志性的狡黠笑容。那种笑容仿佛在说，我知道一些你不知道的事，而且这简直是世界上最滑稽的事。加持脸上那种表情通常会让她浑身发麻，全身酥软，但像现在这样的时刻，她想不出还有什么比这更让她讨厌的了。

"Katsuragi. If you think they don't know about us, about the children, about everything, then you're in for a rude awakening."  
“葛城。如果你以为他们对我们、对孩子们、对这一切一无所知，那你可就大错特错了。”

Misato narrowed her eyes. Something almost resembling mischief was flashing in Kaji's deep-set eyes. _What's so funny?_ Misato wanted to ask, but she twisted her wrist out of his grip and slammed the door shut. Beyond the blurry window, in the slowly dying light, Kaji was bowing his head like a tuxedo-wearing gentleman in a baroque banquet hall, his right hand over his heart. Misato shook her head in disgust and turned away, feeling an odd tightness in her chest.  
美里眯起了眼睛。在加持那深陷的眼眸中，闪过一丝近乎恶作剧的神情。有什么好笑的？美里想问，但她扭动手腕挣脱了他的握持，砰地一声关上了门。在模糊的窗外，在渐渐消逝的光线中，加持像穿着燕尾服的绅士在巴洛克风格的宴会厅里一样，低头鞠躬，右手放在心口。美里厌恶地摇了摇头，转身离开，感到胸口一阵莫名的紧绷。

### Chapter 14 Angel of the sky (2)

Shinji had almost forgotten how annoying a plugsuit could be. He fumbled putting the fingers of his right hand inside the glove and sighed, annoyed at both it and himself.  
真嗣几乎忘记了紧身衣有多么烦人。他笨拙地将右手的手指伸进手套，叹了口气，既恼火于它也恼火于自己。

Since arriving in Tokyo-3, Shinji had to come to headquarters at least once a week, even when there wasn't a battle. To train, to go through routine testing, or for some other fine tuning they didn't bother to explain. After all that, he thought he'd gotten used to the annoying, clingy rubber suit and the cold locker room that stank of disinfectant. Apparently, he hadn't. A two week hiatus left him struggling with the plugsuit like he did during his first month.  
自从抵达第三新东京市以来，真嗣每周至少得去总部报到一次，即便没有战斗也是如此。训练、接受常规检测，或是为了某些他们懒得解释的微调。尽管如此，他本以为自己已经习惯了那件令人厌烦、紧贴的橡胶服和弥漫着消毒水气味的冰冷更衣室。显然，他并没有。两周的间歇期让他再次像初来乍到时那样，与插入栓服苦苦挣扎。

He finally managed to slip his thumb in the glove. He clenched and unclenched his fist once and narrowed his eyes. Come to think of it, the real problem might not be that he'd been gone for so long. It was probably more psychological than anything, because for the past few days, Shinji had almost completely forgotten about the whole Evangelion business. About NERV. Angels. School. Friends. Ayanami. Father. Even Misato, his guardian who he still constantly saw at home, felt more like a mere shadow to him these days. This week, with no school and no calls from NERV, his interactions with Asuka became the demarcations between his days. Instead of Tuesday and Wednesday and such, it was Grocery Shopping Date Day, or The Day They Kissed On The Balcony For The First Time, or The Day She Tried To…  
他终于成功地将拇指塞进了手套。他握紧又松开拳头一次，眯起了眼睛。仔细想想，真正的问题或许并不在于他离开太久。这多半是心理因素，因为过去几天里，真嗣几乎完全忘记了关于 EVA 的一切。关于 NERV、使徒、学校、朋友、绫波、父亲。甚至连他仍在家中经常见到的监护人美里，这些天在他看来也不过是个模糊的影子。这一周，没有学校，也没有来自 NERV 的电话，他与明日香的互动成了划分他日子的标志。不再是星期二、星期三之类的，而是“采购日”，或是“他们在阳台上第一次接吻的那天”，又或是“她试图……”

His left arm got caught at the elbow, forcing him to pull it out completely and try again. While doing so, Shinji forcefully pushed thoughts of Asuka out of his head. The same way he pushed her away when she tried to kiss him earlier this evening, wearing just a camisole. Now that he had his arms successfully tucked in, he would soon have to pressurize the suit, and that required cooperation from a certain part of his body.  
他的左臂在肘部被卡住，迫使他完全抽出并重新尝试。在此过程中，真嗣强行将明日香的身影从脑海中赶走。就像今晚早些时候她试图只穿着吊带背心吻他时，他推开她一样。现在他的手臂已经成功塞进去了，很快他就得给这套装甲增压，而这需要身体某个部位的配合。

But, as was always the case when it came to that girl, Shinji couldn't shake her off so easily. He stiffened as he remembered when she came home with her school blouse nearly halfway off, the ribbon undone and pieces of her bra flashing at him whenever she moved. A kaleidoscope of ideas swirled in his brain as he stared shamelessly at the exposed skin of her chest, but he hadn't acted on any of them.  
但每当涉及到那个女孩时，真嗣总是无法轻易摆脱她的影响。他僵住了，回想起她放学回家时，校服衬衫几乎半敞，领带松开，每当她移动时，胸罩的碎片就会在他眼前闪现。他无耻地盯着她裸露的胸膛，脑海中涌现出各种想法，但他一个也没有付诸行动。

Why not? He wasn't even sure. He didn't have a logical, neat explanation. It was more of a half-hearted decision that came out of anxiety and a vague fear that was hard to define. If he thought about it, he had already acted on a similar impulse during their first kiss, and, as one part of Shinji's mind relentlessly reminded him, it hadn't turned out that bad.  
为什么不呢？他自己也不确定。他没有一个逻辑清晰、条理分明的解释。这更像是一个出于焦虑和难以名状的模糊恐惧而做出的半心半意的决定。如果他仔细想想，他在他们的初吻时就已经受到了类似冲动的驱使，而且，正如真嗣内心的一部分无情地提醒他，结果并没有那么糟糕。

"Don't apologize for wanting me," Asuka told him then.  
“不要为想要我而道歉，”明日香当时对他说。

_You were just lucky_. _It could've gone very, very wrong,_ another part of his mind argued back.  
“你只是运气好。事情本可能变得非常、非常糟糕，”他脑海的另一部分反驳道。

Asuka did a very good job of acting like she enjoyed getting physical with him, but Shinji suspected it had less to do with the acts themselves and more to do with the power it gave her over him. She clearly enjoyed that he wanted her, a smug gleam in her eye and a smirk on her lips in the lead-up to and during their make-out sessions. But if anything, she probably preferred the purely emotional aspects of their relationship, absent of Shinji's filthy, base desires. Because for some unfathomable reason, she seemed to genuinely enjoy his company outside of kissing. She looked so _happy_ while chit chatting with him about nothing in particular, and while cooking with him, and while watching TV with him, and even while just sitting quietly together doing not much of anything at all.  
明日香在和他进行身体接触时表现得非常享受，但真嗣怀疑这更多是因为这种行为赋予了她对他的控制力，而非行为本身。她显然很享受他想要她，每次亲热前和过程中，她眼中闪烁着得意的光芒，嘴角挂着得意的微笑。但如果说有什么不同的话，她可能更喜欢他们关系中纯粹的情感部分，不掺杂真嗣那些肮脏、原始的欲望。因为出于某种难以理解的原因，她似乎真的喜欢和他在一起，不仅仅是在亲吻之外。她和他闲聊无关紧要的事情时，一起做饭时，一起看电视时，甚至只是安静地坐在一起无所事事时，都显得那么开心。

He was grateful that she was putting up with his desire. But he didn't want to test Asuka's limits too much too soon. He was blessed with her favor already. He couldn't bear the thought of getting too greedy and losing what he already had. Even though Asuka still fully expected him to act the pervert. His lack of action this past evening probably surprised her. Maybe she was even worried that something was wrong, and that was why she got so angry.  
他感激她能容忍他的渴望。但他不想过早地过度考验明日香的极限。他已经得到了她的青睐，这已是莫大的福分。他无法承受因过于贪婪而失去现有的一切的想法。尽管明日香仍完全期待他会表现得像个变态。他昨晚的克制可能让她感到惊讶。也许她甚至担心出了什么问题，这就是为什么她会如此生气。

But she'd looked genuinely insulted when he'd pushed her away. As if she was being denied something that she desperately wanted and couldn't understand why. Or perhaps, horror of horrors, she took it as a sign that his interest in her was waning. But Shinji had done it for the future of their relationship, and he would have told her so, if not for the urgent knock on the door. The sensation of Asuka's seething glare burning into his back was drowned in cool relief when he answered and was greeted by Section 2 agents on the other side.  
但当他推开她时，她的确显得受到了真正的侮辱。仿佛她被拒绝了她迫切想要且无法理解为何得不到的东西。或者，更糟糕的是，她可能认为这是他对她兴趣减退的迹象。但真嗣这样做是为了他们关系的未来，如果不是因为那急促的敲门声，他会告诉她的。当他开门看到对面站着第二课的特工时，明日香愤怒的目光在他背上燃烧的感觉被一阵凉爽的解脱感淹没了。

Shinji shivered as he fastened the collar around his neck. His thoughts drifted back to their fight over Kensuke's letter. While what came afterwards was the sweetest thing he'd ever tasted in his life, the fight itself was the last thing in the world he wanted to repeat. He'd rather fight an Angel than argue again. And it was not an exaggeration. The rapidity from which she'd gone from flirtatious to shocked to angry after he'd refused her today was honestly frightening. If things had been allowed to escalate, the result would have likely been the emotional equivalent of an N2 mine directly on Shinji's heart.  
真嗣颤抖着将项圈系在脖子上。他的思绪飘回到他们为健介的信而争吵的时刻。尽管之后发生的事情是他一生中尝过的最甜蜜的，但争吵本身却是他最不想重蹈覆辙的事情。他宁愿与使徒战斗也不愿再争论一次。这并非夸张。她从挑逗到震惊再到愤怒的转变速度，今天在他拒绝她之后，实在是令人害怕。如果事情继续升级，结果很可能是直接在真嗣的心上引爆一颗 N2 地雷般的情感冲击。

Shinji frowned as he clenched and unclenched his fist, checking the fit one last time. _Why does she always have to make things so complicated,_ he wondered. He would happily settle for just holding hands, hugging, kissing, cooking together, and going out on dates. Why didn't she understand that? Shinji could handle the rest alone in a dark room, which he was already doing very well.  
真嗣皱着眉头，握紧又松开拳头，最后一次检查贴合度。他心想，为什么她总是要把事情弄得这么复杂。他很乐意满足于牵手、拥抱、亲吻、一起做饭和出去约会。她为什么就是不明白呢？真嗣可以在一个黑暗的房间里独自处理剩下的部分，他已经做得很好了。

She was right across the screen that served as a border between the boys' and girls' sections. Would she have finished changing by now? Could he turn around? The screen was not fully translucent, making the silhouette on the other side clearly visible, so Shinji had deliberately turned his back to it. Now that he thought about it, it was very quiet over there…  
她就隔着那块作为男生区和女生区分界线的屏幕。她现在应该换好衣服了吧？他能转身了吗？屏幕并非完全透明，另一边的轮廓清晰可见，因此真嗣特意背对着它。现在想来，那边异常安静……

"What's taking so long? It's not like it's your first time or something."  
“怎么这么慢？又不是第一次了。”

The shrill voice made Shinji gasp in surprise. He spun around to find a fully suited Asuka leaning against a locker directly in front of the screen, arms crossed. Shinji's face flushed.  
尖锐的声音让真嗣吓了一跳。他转过身，发现穿着全套装备的明日香正双臂交叉，倚靠在屏幕正前方的储物柜上。真嗣的脸一下子红了。

"Asuka! I'm not done yet! Just how long have you been there..."  
"明日香！我还没说完呢！你到底在那里站了多久..."

Asuka pushed away from the locker, straightening herself. She uncrossed her arms to slide her hands down to her hips in her favorite position. "What's all the fuss about? How long are you going to keep it all prim and proper? Am I not allowed to see you?"  
明日香从储物柜旁推开，挺直了身子。她解开交叉的双臂，将手滑到腰间，摆出她最喜欢的姿势。"怎么了，这么大惊小怪的？你要保持这副端庄的样子到什么时候？难道我就不能看你吗？"

_And what the hell does that mean?_ Shinji's head spun. Did that mean he could look at her when she was getting dressed, or when she got out of the shower?  
这到底是什么意思？真嗣的脑袋一片混乱。这是说他可以看她换衣服，还是她从浴室出来的时候？

Shinji hunched over again as his barely soothed body part tensed up once more. Asuka snorted at that, and Shinji wondered if she knew.  
真嗣再次弯下腰，他那刚刚平复的身体部位又一次紧绷起来。明日香对此嗤之以鼻，真嗣不禁疑惑她是否知情。

"Don't worry. You were already struggling with the arms when I came over. And you were standing with your back to me. I've probably seen more when you were wearing that stupid tank top, you know, the one with _piss of mind_ on it."  
“别担心。我来的时候你已经在和手臂较劲了。而且你背对着我站着。我可能在你穿那件愚蠢的坦克背心时看到的更多，你知道的，就是那件印着‘精神错乱’的。”

"Peace of mind." “心平气和。”

"What?" "什么？"

"The kanji on that shirt. It means _peace of mind."_  
那件衬衫上的汉字。它意味着心灵的平静。

Asuka just rolled her eyes, crossing her arms again.  
明日香只是翻了个白眼，再次交叉双臂。

Peace of mind. That was exactly what Shinji needed right now. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes. He always found it difficult to look at Asuka in her plugsuit and stay calm, and it was even worse now that he'd held that body several times. Looking at her in that skin tight outfit made him remember yanking her roughly into his arms, all his doubts and hesitations subsumed by burning desire. He could clearly recall the sensation of her hard bones and soft flesh, vivid on his skin. He loved those feelings so much that he wondered if he had become addicted to them. Shinji took a deep breath. Those were the last things he needed to be reminded of right now. As a last resort, he recalled the heat and pressure of the volcano, and the tentacles of Angel that had pierced his stomach, wiggling inside him, and the feelings of his broken yet unbroken arm.  
心灵的平静。这正是真嗣此刻所需要的。他深吸一口气，闭上了眼睛。他总是觉得看着穿着插入栓服的明日香很难保持冷静，而现在他多次拥抱过她的身体，情况更糟了。看着她那紧身装束，让他回想起粗暴地将她拉入怀中的情景，所有的疑虑和犹豫都被炽热的欲望所吞没。他能清晰地回忆起她坚硬的骨骼和柔软的肌肤，这些感觉在他皮肤上生动地重现。他如此深爱这些感觉，以至于他怀疑自己是否已经对它们上瘾。真嗣深吸一口气。这些是他现在最不需要被提醒的事情。最后，他想起了火山的热度和压力，以及刺穿他腹部的使徒触手，在他体内蠕动，还有他那破碎却未断裂的手臂的感觉。

Such gory images did wonders to kill his erection. Shinji took that opportunity to straighten up, then pressed the button on his left wrist. The compressor squeezed the air out of the suit in a single heartbeat. The rubbery material hugged his body tightly.  
这些血腥的画面真是让他瞬间没了兴致。真嗣趁机挺直身子，按下了左手腕上的按钮。压缩器在瞬间将空气从紧身衣中挤出，橡胶材质紧紧贴合着他的身体。

While Shinji shrugged and turned his shoulders to make sure it had compressed right, Asuka turned and headed for the door without a word. Shinji hurried after her. He caught her just before the automatic door closed. Asuka didn't look back or say anything as she led them down the half-lit hallway. They were heading to the pilot's lounge as they'd been ordered.  
真嗣耸了耸肩，转动肩膀确保紧身衣压缩得合适，而明日香则一言不发地转身向门口走去。真嗣急忙跟上，在自动门关闭前一刻追上了她。明日香没有回头，也没有说话，只是带着他们穿过半明半暗的走廊，按照命令前往飞行员休息室。

Resisting the urge to grab her arm and stop her right there, Shinji spoke up.  
真嗣强忍住抓住她手臂阻止她的冲动，开口说道。

"Asuka, are you still angry?"  
“明日香，你还在生气吗？”

Asuka stopped in her tracks. She turned back to Shinji, glaring. It was an expression Shinji was familiar with from their first month of living together. For a moment Shinji was afraid she would start a fight right there, but the sound of rapidly approaching footsteps made both their heads turn.  
明日香停下脚步，转身面向真嗣，目光凌厉。这是真嗣在他们同居第一个月里就熟悉的表情。有那么一瞬间，真嗣担心她会当场爆发，但急促接近的脚步声让两人同时转头。

A short woman in a NERV uniform stepped hurriedly around the corner in front of them. A clipboard and a PDA so densely coated with wires it looked like it'd grown hair were clutched to her chest. She paused for a moment in surprise as she came face to face with the Children, but then she smiled.  
一个身穿 NERV 制服的矮个女子匆忙绕过拐角出现在他们面前。她胸前紧抱着一个夹板和一个 PDA，上面密密麻麻缠满了线缆，看起来像是长出了毛发。她惊讶地停顿了一下，与孩子们面对面相遇，随即露出了微笑。

"Hello, you two! You're a little late. I was starting to wonder if everything was okay. How are you feeling, Shinji? I've been worried about you."  
"你们好，两位！有点晚了哦。我开始担心是不是一切都好。你感觉怎么样，真嗣？我一直很担心你。"

Shinji smiled shyly, momentarily forgetting the anxiety that had been simmering inside him for some time. Asuka, the sudden call, and the prospect of battle had been slowly eating his mind away. Lieutenant Maya Ibuiki had always been kind and considerate towards him, making her one of the few NERV personnel Shinji didn't feel uncomfortable around, even if he couldn't quite call her a friend.  
真嗣腼腆地笑了笑，暂时忘记了内心深处积压已久的焦虑。明日香突如其来的电话和即将到来的战斗，一直在慢慢侵蚀他的心智。伊吹摩耶中尉对他总是既友善又体贴，这让她成为少数几个真嗣在 NERV 中不感到不自在的人员之一，尽管他无法完全称她为朋友。

"It's okay, Lieutenant. I'm feeling much better now. Almost normal."  
"没事的，中尉。我现在感觉好多了。几乎恢复正常了。"

"Good, good. Well, I'm here to do a quick medical exam. Mind sitting over there for a minute?"  
"好，好。那么，我来做个快速体检。介意在那边坐一会儿吗？"

Lieutenant Ibuki gestured toward a bench in the hallway with her chin. Shinji nodded. The lieutenant sat down next to him and connected her PDA to the backplate of his suit. After a moment, he felt pressure on his upper right arm. Lieutenant Ibuki lifted the arm slightly and stretched it out in front of him. "Relax. It won't take long."  
伊吹中尉用下巴示意走廊里的一条长凳。真嗣点点头。中尉在他旁边坐下，将她的 PDA 连接到他套装的背板上。过了一会儿，他感到右上臂有压力。伊吹中尉轻轻抬起他的手臂，向前伸展。“放松。不会花很长时间的。”

Shinji nodded, blushing slightly. The lieutenant's hand on his elbow was gentle and warm, and Shinji couldn't help but be conscious of it. Then Shinji felt Asuka's burning glare, and realized she didn't like his reaction to the lieutenant's touch one bit. He didn't dare look at her.  
真嗣点点头，脸上微微泛红。中尉放在他肘部的手既温柔又温暖，真嗣不禁注意到这一点。接着，真嗣感受到明日香灼热的目光，意识到她一点也不喜欢他对中尉触碰的反应。他不敢看她。

Fortunately for him, the test only took about a minute. As soon as the PDA beeped, Shinji jumped to his feet, glancing nervously at Asuka. Refusing eye contact with him, Asuka turned her head away, ignoring Shinji.  
幸运的是，测试只持续了大约一分钟。PDA 一发出哔哔声，真嗣立刻跳了起来，紧张地瞥了明日香一眼。明日香拒绝与他对视，转过头去，无视了真嗣。

Lieutenant Ibuki hastily stood up. "Wait, you're still connected."  
伊吹摩耶少尉急忙站起身。"等等，你还没断开连接。"

Unplugging the wires with one hand, the lieutenant peered at the PDA screen. "All normal. Blood pressure is a bit high, but it's within a tolerable range. You must be stronger than you look, Shinji. A boy after all, I guess."  
少尉用一只手拔掉电线，盯着 PDA 屏幕。"一切正常。血压有点高，但在可接受范围内。你比看起来要强壮，真嗣。毕竟还是个男孩，我想。"

Asuka snorted. "If only."  
明日香哼了一声。“要是那样就好了。”

Shinji felt like he'd just gotten stabbed. Over the last week, a magical week, Asuka had teased him several times, but never in the tone she'd used just now, the one reserved for real insults. He hadn't thought much of it before, but now that they were dating, there was something particularly painful and insulting when she dismissed him like that. Shinji looked down at the floor, frowning.  
真嗣感觉自己像是被刺了一刀。过去的一周，神奇的一周，明日香曾几次戏弄他，但从没有用刚才那种语气，那种专门用来真正侮辱人的语气。他之前没太在意，但现在他们正在交往，她那样轻蔑地对待他，让他感到特别痛苦和受辱。真嗣低头看着地板，皱起了眉头。

Sensing that something was amiss, Lieutenant Ibuki glanced questioningly at both Asuka and Shinji, but neither pilot was in the mood to give her an explanation. Eventually, she coughed awkwardly, then tapped at the seat where Shinji had been sitting just moments ago.  
察觉到气氛不对，伊吹摩耶中尉疑惑地看了看明日香和真嗣，但两位驾驶员都没有心情向她解释。最终，她尴尬地咳嗽了一声，然后敲了敲真嗣刚刚坐过的座位。

"Your turn, Asuka." "该你了，明日香。"

Asuka crossed her arms, refusing to move. "Why bother? I'm not the one who's been sick for weeks."  
明日香交叉双臂，拒绝行动。“何必呢？我又不是那个病了好几周的人。”

_If you stopped being childish and did what you were told, you would have been halfway done already._ Shinji swallowed those words back. He knew he shouldn't say such a thing, but it was tempting. So tempting.  
如果你不再耍小孩子脾气，乖乖听话，早就完成一半了。真嗣咽下了这些话。他知道不该这么说，但实在太诱人了。如此诱人。

Unlike Shinji, Lieutenant Ibuki smiled calmly.  
与真嗣不同，一尉伊吹摩耶平静地微笑着。

"We have to observe procedures, miss. Now come along."  
“我们必须遵守程序，小姐。现在请跟我来。”

Asuka snorted, flicking her hair. "You Japanese and your obsession with silly rules."  
明日香哼了一声，甩了甩头发。“你们日本人就是对那些愚蠢的规则念念不忘。”

Shinji saw the lieutenant's eyes harden for a moment. Asuka's nose was raised and pointed haughtily away, so she probably didn't realize it, but it was hard to miss from Shinji's perspective. And Shinji didn't blame the lieutenant.  
真嗣注意到中尉的眼神瞬间变得冷硬。明日香的鼻子高高扬起，傲慢地转向一旁，她可能并未察觉，但真嗣的角度却难以忽视。真嗣并不怪罪中尉。

_I kiss that girl and I think she's hard to deal with sometimes. Of course it's hard for you.  
我亲吻那个女孩，有时觉得她难以相处。你当然会觉得困难。_

Silence fell as Lieutenant Ibuki hooked up the PDA to Asuka's suit and fiddled with it. Asuka soon filled it.  
沉默降临，伊吹中尉将 PDA 连接到明日香的战斗服上，开始摆弄。很快，明日香打破了沉默。

"You don't seem too urgent. Neither does HQ. Or the city. Haven't heard an evacuation siren, either. Are you sure an Angel is actually coming?"  
"你看起来并不急迫。总部也是。城市也一样。连疏散警报都没听到。你确定使徒真的要来了吗？"

Shinji blinked and looked at the lieutenant. It was true. After hearing the dreaded word 'emergency' from the Section 2 agents, he'd dressed hurriedly and leapt into their cars, but on the drive to the Geofront, Shinji hadn't noticed anything out of the ordinary. Businesses were still open. People were walking leisurely to and fro, not running to shelter. The skyscrapers hadn't even been retracted. At headquarters, they saw some staff walking around, but there was no sense of urgency that one would expect if there was a battle happening in the near future.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，看着中尉。确实如此。在听到特务机关第二课那令人心惊的‘紧急’二字后，他匆忙穿戴好，跳上了他们的车，但在前往地底都市的途中，真嗣并未察觉到任何异常。商店依旧营业。人们悠闲地来回走动，没有奔向避难所。摩天大楼甚至都未曾收回。在总部，他们看到一些工作人员走动，但若即将发生战斗，那种应有的紧迫感却丝毫未见。

"Because we haven't raised a first level alert yet."  
"因为我们还未提升至一级警戒状态。"

"Why?" Shinji and Asuka asked at the same time. Shinji walked over to where Asuka was sitting and squatted down in front of her.  
"为什么？" 真嗣和明日香同时问道。真嗣走到明日香坐的地方，蹲在她面前。

"Eh, well…" Ibuki smiled awkwardly, scratching her head. "It's Captain Katsuragi's job to brief the pilots, but…oh, whatever. Just don't tell anyone I told you guys. Not that I know much right now anyway."  
"呃，这个嘛……" 伊吹苦笑着挠了挠头。"向驾驶员简报是葛城司令的工作，但是……哎，算了。只是别告诉任何人是我告诉你们的。反正我现在知道的也不多。"

Shinji and Asuka nodded at the same time. The lieutenant raised a hand to cover her mouth and giggled. "Do you have any idea how cute you look when you do that?"  
真嗣和明日香同时点了点头。少尉举起手捂住嘴，轻声笑了起来。"你们知道你们这样子有多可爱吗？"

While Shinji blushed and stammered, Asuka clicked her tongue, annoyed. "Just answer the question."  
尽管真嗣脸红结巴，明日香不耐烦地咂了咂嘴。“直接回答问题。”

The lieutenant started scribbling something on the clipboard.  
中尉开始在剪贴板上潦草地写着什么。

"Long story short," she said, "the target has been spotted, but it's too far away. It's not moving this way yet, and there's nothing we can do about it right now either. We're all here just in case, since we have no idea what it's capable of."  
“长话短说，”她说，“目标已被发现，但距离太远。它目前还没有朝这边移动，我们现在也做不了什么。我们都在这儿以防万一，因为我们完全不知道它有什么能力。”

Asuka tilted her head. "Too far away? What do you mean? Where is it?"  
明日香歪了歪头。“太远了？什么意思？在哪里？”

Lieutenant Ibuiki raised her pen. Only after a moment did Shinji realize she was pointing at the ceiling.  
伊吹副官举起了她的笔。过了片刻，真嗣才意识到她指的是天花板。

"It was spotted forty minutes ago in low Earth orbit over the Indian Ocean. Roughly the size of six standard Tokyo-3 core city blocks. Nothing to analyze yet in terms of behavioral patterns. It's just been hovering."  
“四十分钟前在印度洋上空的低地球轨道发现了它。大约有六个标准东京-3 核心城区那么大。目前还没有行为模式可供分析。它只是一直在悬停。”

Shinji's mouth went dry. The lieutenant sounded so nonchalant, but the size of it alone made it a force to be reckoned with in Shinji's mind. It was hard to even imagine. Asuka was right in front of him, so Shinji didn't say anything, but his heart fluttered as fear-induced adrenaline surged through him. Asuka didn't say anything either. Shinji had no way to tell what was going through her mind now. The lieutenant was also silent, still scribbling furiously on her clipboard.  
真嗣的嘴发干。这位中尉听起来如此漫不经心，但光是它的规模就足以在真嗣心中构成一股不可小觑的力量。他几乎难以想象。明日香就站在他面前，所以真嗣什么也没说，但他的心跳加速，恐惧引发的肾上腺素在他体内涌动。明日香也没有说话。真嗣无法得知她此刻在想什么。中尉也保持沉默，仍在她的记事板上奋笔疾书。

Not much time had passed before the PDA beeped again. Lieutenant Ibuki checked the screen, nodding.  
没过多久，PDA 再次发出哔哔声。伊吹中尉查看屏幕，点了点头。

"Good. All three of you are clear for combat duty. Stay in the lounge until further notice. I have to go now."  
“很好。你们三人都已获准执行战斗任务。在接到进一步通知前，请留在休息室。我现在得走了。”

Shinji's ears perked up. "Three of us, Lieutenant?"  
真嗣的耳朵竖了起来。“三个人，伊吹副队长？”

Lieutenant Ibuki nodded as she tucked the clipboard into her side and tidied the wires with both hands. "Yeah, three. Rei's waiting in the lounge."  
伊吹副队长一边将夹板塞到身侧，一边用双手整理着电线，点了点头。“是的，三个人。绫波在休息室等着。”

He felt like an idiot. Of course Ayanami would be here. It would be very weird if she wasn't.  
他觉得自己像个傻瓜。当然绫波会在这里。如果她不在，那才奇怪呢。

Shinji's heart soared. He hadn't seen or heard from Ayanami since he'd been suspended. She was probably doing just fine, but Shinji still wanted to see her and make sure she was okay. He felt bad that he had almost completely forgotten about her for so long. Shinji nodded farewell to Lieutenant Ibuki and then stood up and headed for the lounge.  
真嗣的心飞扬起来。自从他被停职以来，他就没有见过或听到过绫波的消息。她大概过得很好，但真嗣还是想见见她，确认她没事。他为自己这么久几乎完全忘记了她而感到内疚。真嗣向伊吹副官点头告别，然后站起身来，朝休息室走去。

Sure enough, as soon as he opened the door, he saw Ayanami sitting on a couch directly across from the entrance. Her face was expressionless, but Shinji could see something akin to a smile in her serene red eyes as they met his. Shinji smiled without thinking about it. Unlike with Asuka, he didn't have to try and decipher the hidden meaning behind her words and gestures. Ayanami always said exactly what she meant.  
果然，他一打开门，就看到绫波坐在入口正对面的沙发上。她的脸上没有表情，但真嗣能在她平静的红色眼睛里看到一丝类似微笑的神情，当她的目光与他相遇时。真嗣不由自主地笑了。与明日香不同，他不必费力去解读她话语和动作背后的隐含意义。绫波总是直截了当地表达她的意思。

Ayanami stood up from her seat. There was not a single hint of urgency in her demeanor, but despite that, the implication was clear. It was reflected in the strange, almost lilting tone with which she said his name.  
绫波从座位上站了起来。她的举止中没有一丝急迫的迹象，但尽管如此，其含义却很明确。这反映在她用那种奇怪的、几乎抑扬顿挫的语调叫他的名字上。

Shinji felt something warm in his chest. His hands impulsively shot out and grasped Ayanami's. It wasn't until she raised her eyebrows ever so slightly and looked down at their joined hands that Shinji realized what he had done. Heat rose to his face. It occurred to him that he must have gotten so used to physical contact with Asuka he unconsciously did something similar to Ayanami, something he would never have dared to do in the past.  
真嗣感到胸口涌起一股暖流。他的双手不由自主地伸出，紧紧握住了绫波的手。直到她微微挑起眉毛，低头看向他们紧握的双手，真嗣才意识到自己做了什么。他的脸颊热了起来。他意识到，自己一定是习惯了与明日香的身体接触，以至于不自觉地对绫波做了类似的事情，这在过去他是绝不敢做的。

But just as Shinji was about to let go of Ayanami's hands, sudden doubt engulfed him. She was his fellow pilot, a comrade, someone he fought together with and who he could potentially die beside. What was the big deal about holding hands, especially when you hadn't seen each other in a while? Shinji couldn't come up with a counterargument. Sticking his tongue in the mouth of the girl he liked had given him a boost of courage, it seemed.  
但就在真嗣准备放开绫波的手时，突然的疑虑笼罩了他。她是他的战友，一个并肩作战的伙伴，一个可能与他同生共死的人。握手有什么大不了的，尤其是当你们已经有一段时间没见面了？真嗣找不到反驳的理由。似乎是亲吻了他喜欢的女孩，给了他勇气。

So Shinji, while still holding Ayanami's hands, walked around the table that was set in the middle of the room, and sat down on the sofa where Ayanami had been sitting. Ayanami wobbled back to her previous seat, almost dragged by Shinji's hands. Shinji's face broke into an easy smile. "It's been a while, Ayanami. How are you?"  
于是，真嗣一边仍握着绫波的手，一边绕过房间中央的桌子，坐在了绫波之前坐的沙发上。绫波踉跄着回到原来的座位，几乎是被真嗣的手拖着。真嗣的脸上露出了轻松的笑容。“好久不见了，绫波。你还好吗？”

Only after hearing his own voice did Shinji realize that this wasn't something he'd usually say at all. Just like the way he held her hands. He blushed a little. Something had changed inside him since the day he'd given up Kensuke's letter to Asuka and received a kiss in return, and he wasn't sure what to make of it. Ayanami seemed to feel the same way, because her mouth opened slightly but no words came out.  
直到听到自己的声音，真嗣才意识到这根本不是他会说的话。就像他握住她的手的方式一样。他的脸微微泛红。自从那天他把 Kensuke 的信交给明日香并得到了一个吻作为回报后，他内心发生了某种变化，而他不确定该如何理解这种变化。绫波似乎也有同样的感觉，因为她的嘴微微张开，却没有说出话来。

An awkward silence descended, but Asuka broke it with lightning speed. She was leaning against the wall just next to the door, her arms crossed. Shinji's heart froze at the look on her face, and he cautiously let go of Ayanami's hands.  
一阵尴尬的沉默降临，但明日香以闪电般的速度打破了它。她靠在门旁的墙上，双臂交叉。真嗣看到她的表情，心跳都停了一拍，他小心翼翼地放开了绫波的手。

"Hello, First." "你好，一等兵。"

Asuka's voice was unnaturally pleasant. Shinji's stomach dropped. Asuka tilted her head with a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. Ayanami closed her mouth with a click and stared levelly back at Asuka. None of the warmth with which she'd looked at Shinji was present in her eyes. Shinji could feel the temperature dropping.  
明日香的语气异常愉快。真嗣的胃部一沉。明日香侧头微笑，但眼中并未流露笑意。绫波闭上嘴，发出一声轻响，平静地回视明日香。她看向真嗣时的温暖目光已不复存在。真嗣能感觉到气温在下降。

"Second." "二等兵。"

Ayanami's voice was a cold monotone. Asuka's entire body stiffened, including her expression. After a few terrifying seconds, only the corner of her mouth continued to turn up as other parts of her remained completely still. Shinji was beginning to think she looked a little demented. He glanced nervously at Ayanami. She remained unmoved.  
绫波的声音冷淡而单调。明日香整个人都僵硬了，包括她的表情。在几秒钟的恐怖沉默后，只有她的嘴角继续上扬，其他部分完全静止。真嗣开始觉得她看起来有点疯狂。他紧张地瞥了一眼绫波。她依旧无动于衷。

"Now that you _said hello,"_ Asuka said through her wooden smile, "why don't you excuse us for a moment?"  
“既然你已经打过招呼了，”明日香带着僵硬的笑容说，“不如你先让我们单独待一会儿？”

Shinji opened his mouth, thinking he should put a stop to this for once, but Ayanami beat him to it.  
真嗣张开嘴，心想这次应该阻止这一切，但绫波抢先了一步。

"Why?" “为什么？”

Instead of answering, Asuka slowly, theatrically, turned her head to Shinji, and it was at that moment that Shinji realized he was as much the intended audience as Ayanami. When their eyes met, Asuka smiled a smile that was not a smile, and kept her gaze fixed on Shinji as she spoke.  
阿斯卡没有回答，而是缓慢而戏剧性地转头看向真嗣，就在那一刻，真嗣意识到自己与绫波同样是她所针对的对象。当他们的目光相遇时，阿斯卡露出了一个并非笑容的微笑，并始终凝视着真嗣，继续说道。

"Why are you so clueless, Wondergirl? I'm asking you to leave so I can talk to _my. Boyfriend."_  
“为什么你这么迟钝，奇迹少女？我让你离开，是为了和我的男朋友谈谈。”

Shinji was speechless with shock, and that made Asuka's eyes narrow. Ayanami sat wordlessly for a moment, then slowly looked around. Her eyes darted over Asuka's shoulder, to the door.  
真嗣震惊得说不出话来，这让阿斯卡的眼睛眯了起来。绫波沉默了一会儿，然后缓缓环顾四周。她的目光掠过阿斯卡的肩膀，投向门口。

Shinji would have laughed if this was happening to someone other than himself. But Asuka, apparently, had a very different interpretation of Ayanami's actions than he did. Her face flushed bright red, noticeable even under the dim light. There was barely suppressed anger in her voice when she spoke through clenched teeth.  
如果这事发生在别人身上，真嗣可能会笑出声来。但显然，明日香对绫波行为的解读与他截然不同。她的脸颊在昏暗的光线下也泛起了鲜红，几乎能察觉到她紧咬牙关时声音中压抑的怒火。

"Yeah, I know it's hard to believe. I agree. But that's how it is. So leave. _Now."_  
“是啊，我知道这很难相信。我同意。但事实就是如此。所以离开吧。现在。”

Ayanami blinked once, her face still expressionless. Then she shook her head slightly. "I cannot. I have been ordered to wait in this lounge until further notice."  
绫波眨了一下眼，脸上依旧毫无表情。然后她轻轻摇了摇头。“我不能。我被命令在此休息室等待进一步通知。”

_We'll leave_, Shinji was about to say, but Asuka reacted like she'd been expecting Ayanami's words verbatim.  
我们离开吧，真嗣正要说，但明日香反应过来，仿佛早就预料到绫波的话一字不差。

"Oh, but we've received the exact same orders. One person disobeying is definitely better than two, don't you think?"  
“哦，但我们接到了完全相同的命令。一个人违抗总比两个人都违抗要好，你不觉得吗？”

Ayanami shook her head. "We were ordered to be on standby together. There is no other option."  
绫波摇了摇头。“我们被命令一起待命。没有其他选择。”

Asuka strode over and stood directly in front of Shinji and Ayanami. For a moment, Shinji feared that she was about to strike the other girl. Asuka didn't move her hands from her hips, luckily. At least not yet.  
明日香大步走过来，直接站在真嗣和绫波面前。有那么一会儿，真嗣担心她会动手打绫波。幸运的是，明日香的手依然叉在腰上，至少目前还没有动手的迹象。

"Oh, so it's a matter of principle? But if that's the case, why are you not respecting the _principle_ of leaving when a couple wants privacy?"  
“哦，原来是个原则问题？但既然如此，你为什么不尊重情侣需要隐私的原则呢？”

That was unreasonable even for Asuka. He hated that she was using their relationship as a tool to bully Ayanami. He squirmed in his seat. He had to intervene now, not only for Ayanami's sake, but also to save Asuka from certain humiliation. He started to rise.  
这种话连明日香自己都觉得无理。他讨厌她利用他们的关系来欺负绫波。他在座位上不安地扭动，必须现在介入，不仅是为了绫波，也是为了拯救明日香免受必然的羞辱。他开始起身。

"Asuka, if you have something to say to me, we can go outside and -"  
"明日香，如果你有话要对我说，我们可以出去说——"

Asuka shoved Shinji's shoulder, knocking him back to the couch. The suddenness of the action stunned him into silence. He looked up at her, wide-eyed. Asuka raised her index finger and pointed it at Shinji's face, almost poking his eye. "_You_ better think really carefully about who you're supposed to side with before you open your stupid mouth."  
明日香猛地推了真嗣的肩膀，将他推回到沙发上。这一突如其来的动作让他愣住了，无言以对。他抬头看着她，眼睛睁得大大的。明日香竖起食指，指向真嗣的脸，几乎要戳到他的眼睛。"你最好在张开你那愚蠢的嘴巴之前，仔细想想你应该站在谁那边。"

_I'm doing this for you_. Shinji felt an odd sensation in his chest, half cold and half burning hot, mixed together but not mingling. He grit his teeth.  
我这么做是为了你。真嗣感到胸口涌起一种奇怪的感觉，一半冰冷一半炽热，交织在一起却又不相融合。他咬紧了牙关。

When Shinji showed no sign of speaking up, Asuka immediately turned her attention back to Ayanami. Ayanami looked at Shinji for a moment, then turned her head to meet Asuka's gaze.  
当真嗣没有表现出要说话的迹象时，明日香立刻将注意力转回到绫波身上。绫波看了真嗣一会儿，然后转过头来迎上明日香的目光。

"What is this principle? I have not heard of such a thing."  
“这是什么原则？我从没听说过这种事。”

"Okay, then let me make it easier for you. How about _basic social skills?_ Ever heard of those?"  
“好吧，那我给你解释得更简单些。基本的社交技巧呢？你听说过吗？”

Ayanami did not blink. "And what do these 'basic social skills' entail?"  
绫波没有眨眼。“那么，这些‘基本社交技能’具体包括什么？”

"Oh, you know. Things that normal humans do. Like saying good morning. Or answering when someone's talking to you. Or realizing when they're not wanted."  
“哦，你知道的。正常人类会做的事情。比如道早安。或者在别人跟你说话时回应。又或者意识到自己不受欢迎的时候。”

Ayanami tilted her head slightly in thought.  
绫波微微侧头，陷入思考。

"Like when you are visiting a sick person, you are supposed to keep it short?"  
"就像探望病人时，应该简短一些那样？"

Asuka snorted. 明日香哼了一声。

"Exactly. You were always smart, Wondergirl, you're picking them up already. You know, you're basically forcing yourself on Shinji right now, and that's very rude."  
"没错。你一直都很聪明，奇迹少女，你已经领悟了。你知道吗，你现在基本上是在强迫自己接近真嗣，这非常无礼。"

_Why is she using me again?_ Shinji felt the resentment he felt back in that hospital room rise up again. No, it was worse than before, because at that time he'd simply thought Asuka was acting strangely. But this time he could see something more malicious in her actions. It was as if Asuka was deliberately trying to drive a wedge between Shinji and Ayanami, tearing them apart.  
为什么她又利用我？真嗣再次感受到在那个病房里产生的怨恨。不，这次比之前更糟糕，因为那时他只觉得明日香行为古怪。但这次他能从她的行动中看出更恶毒的东西。仿佛明日香故意要在真嗣和绫波之间制造隔阂，将他们拆散。

But what could he do? If he offended Asuka even in the slightest, she would lose her temper like she almost did back at the apartment, and it would be Ayanami that would suffer the most. Maybe it would be for the best if Ayanami just did as Asuka said. The thought of the inevitable explosion afterwards made Shinji's hands go cold and clammy inside the plugsuit, but at least Ayanami would avoid getting blown to bits. In that moment, he almost envied her.  
但他能做什么呢？哪怕稍稍惹恼了明日香，她就会像在公寓时那样几乎爆发，而最遭殃的将是绫波。或许让绫波按明日香说的做才是最好的。想到随后不可避免的爆炸，真嗣的手在插入栓服里变得冰冷而潮湿，但至少绫波能避免被炸成碎片。那一刻，他几乎有些羡慕她。

Shinji looked back at Ayanami in despair. She was already looking at him. Maybe it was just his imagination, but she didn't look particularly convinced by Asuka's words. He gestured helplessly back at her, wincing a little. Ayanami slowly picked up the old book on the table and stood up. Shinji did the same. He took a deep breath.  
真嗣绝望地回头看向绫波。她已经在看着他了。或许是他的错觉，但她似乎并不完全相信明日香的话。他无奈地向她示意，微微皱眉。绫波缓缓拿起桌上的旧书，站了起来。真嗣也跟着站起身。他深吸了一口气。

"It's alright, Ayanami. You can rest here, we'll..."  
“没关系，绫波。你可以在这里休息，我们……”

Shinji couldn't finish the sentence. At this point, he realized, things had already been decided, and by standing, Ayanami had conceded to Asuka's wishes. His protest was nothing but a farce, an empty nicety to soothe his own guilt rather than genuine concern for his friend. If anything, it probably just pissed Asuka off more and made things worse. _I'm sorry! But there's nothing else I can do!_  
真嗣没能把话说完。此时他意识到，一切已成定局，绫波站起身来，已然接受了明日香的心愿。他的抗议不过是场闹剧，一种空洞的客套，用以抚慰自己的愧疚而非真正关心朋友。若说有什么影响，那大概只会让明日香更加恼火，使情况变得更糟。对不起！但我已无能为力！

Shinji dropped his outstretched hand and shut his mouth, unable to look at Ayanami any longer. He was utterly disgusted with himself.  
真嗣垂下了伸出的手，闭上了嘴，再也无法直视绫波。他对自己感到极度厌恶。

Ayanami pulled the book close to her chest.  
绫波将书紧紧抱在胸前。

"I am fine, Ikari. This was not the Commander's direct order anyway."  
"我没事，碇。反正这也不是司令的直接命令。"

_What does that even mean?_ Before Shinji could ask, Ayanami headed for the door. On her way out, she passed Asuka, but did not look at her. Asuka ignored Ayanami and glared at Shinji. Shinji ignored Asuka and sat back down on the couch. He clenched his fists to keep them from tearing his hair out. Doing so would probably make Asuka even angrier than she already was.  
这到底是什么意思？还没等真嗣问出口，绫波已经朝门口走去。出门时，她与明日香擦肩而过，却没有看她一眼。明日香无视了绫波，瞪着真嗣。真嗣无视了明日香，重新坐回沙发上。他紧握双拳，以免自己抓狂扯头发，那样只会让明日香更加生气。

As soon as Ayanami left and the automatic door closed behind her, Asuka stepped closer to Shinji. He looked up, feeling a level of irritation he'd forgotten after kissing her for the first time. At the look on her face, he lost his patience.  
绫波一离开，自动门在她身后关闭，明日香立刻向真嗣靠近。他抬头望去，感受到一种久违的烦躁，自从第一次吻她之后就再未体验过。看到她的表情，他失去了耐心。

"Asuka, why are you so mean to her?"  
“明日香，你为什么对她这么刻薄？”

Asuka's body stiffened for a moment, and then her eyes flashed dangerously. Shinji didn't flinch. He was, suddenly, tired of backing down. So what if it escalated things? Shinji had always imagined life with a girlfriend to be one of transcendent bliss - the bleak cold emptiness of his previous existence suddenly suffused with radiant warmth and the magical sensation of being truly cared for. But reality once again eviscerated his fantasies with brutal efficiency. He managed to get a girlfriend, but instead of being able to bask in the comfortable sunlight of her affections, he got a typhoon of a girl with whom he had to walk on eggshells lest she unleash the howling winds of her anger. It wasn't magical or transcendental at all, really, and in many ways it was simply his old life but with the added burden of having to decipher and manage the emotions of someone who seemed to relish in being as ambiguous and unpredictable as possible.  
明日香的身躯僵硬了一瞬，随即眼中闪过危险的光芒。真嗣没有退缩。他突然间厌倦了退让。就算事情升级又如何？真嗣一直想象着与女友共度的日子会是超凡脱俗的幸福——他以往那阴冷空虚的生活突然间充满了温暖的光辉和被人真正关怀的奇妙感觉。但现实再次以残酷的效率撕裂了他的幻想。他确实交到了女朋友，但没能沐浴在她爱意的舒适阳光下，反而遇到了一个暴风般的女孩，他必须如履薄冰，以免她释放出愤怒的狂风。这根本不是什么神奇或超脱的体验，实际上，在很多方面，这只是他旧生活的延续，只是多了要解读和管理一个似乎乐此不疲地保持模糊和不可预测的人的情绪的负担。

Asuka slapped her palm against her chest with a wet, rubbery sound, jolting him back to the present. "It's because you're being mean to me."  
明日香用湿漉漉、黏糊糊的声音拍打着胸口，将他拉回现实。“因为你对我刻薄。”

That confirmed his suspicion. Shinji clenched his teeth.  
这证实了他的猜疑。真嗣咬紧了牙关。

"I've never been mean to you, Asuka."  
“我从没对你刻薄过，明日香。”

As soon as he finished, Shinji was struck with the suspicion that he might have made a tactical mistake. What mattered right now was Asuka's bullying of Ayanami, but in turning things back around on Shinji, she was trying to derail this back to their earlier argument. By countering like that, he opened the door for her to argue about his actions, which was the last thing he wanted nor was the initial point.  
话音刚落，真嗣就怀疑自己可能犯了一个战术错误。眼下重要的是明日香对绫波的欺凌，但她试图将话题转回之前的争论，以此来转移焦点。通过这样反驳，他给了她机会来争论他的行为，而这正是他最不想要的，也不是最初的重点。

"Oh, but you have." "哦，但你确实有。"

It was exactly what Shinji expected. He suppressed the urge to roll his eyes. He knew this was a trap, but he couldn't resist.  
这正是真嗣所预料的。他强忍住翻白眼的冲动。他知道这是个陷阱，但他无法抗拒。

"What are you talking about? We…" _were good_, Shinji didn't say. He wondered if refusing a kiss just one time and being friendly with Ayanami was enough to negate whatever favor he earned by handing over Kensuke's letter. Or maybe there was something deeper behind all this. Shinji couldn't quite tell. He sighed heavily and shook his head.  
"你在说什么？我们……" 真嗣没说出口的是，他们曾经很好。他不知道仅仅一次拒绝亲吻和与绫波友好相处是否足以抵消他通过交出健介的信所赢得的好感。或许这一切背后还有更深层次的原因。真嗣无法完全弄清楚。他重重地叹了口气，摇了摇头。

"What is wrong with you, Asuka…"  
"你到底怎么了，明日香…"

"What's wrong with _you?_" "你怎么了？"

Shinji suddenly felt very, very tired. Instead of arguing back, he opted to keep his mouth shut and turn away from Asuka. He frowned. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Asuka crossing her arms, a definite warning sign, but he kept his gaze on the table. Ignoring her was probably dangerous. Arguing back was probably dangerous. Trying to segue into another topic was probably dangerous.  
真嗣突然感到非常、非常疲惫。他没有回嘴，而是选择闭上嘴巴，转过身去不理明日香。他皱起眉头。眼角的余光中，他能看到明日香交叉双臂，这无疑是个警告信号，但他仍将目光停留在桌子上。无视她可能很危险。回嘴也可能很危险。试图转移话题也可能很危险。

He wished he'd brought his SDAT player.  
他真希望自己带了 SDAT 播放器。

After a few moments, Asuka sighed and plopped down next to Shinji, in the spot where Ayanami had been sitting just moments ago.  
过了一会儿，明日香叹了口气，在真嗣旁边坐下，就在刚才绫波坐过的地方。

Shinji finally relented and turned to look at her, bracing himself for the inevitable. But the look in her eyes was not the one he was expecting. He had seen it many times this week. It was the look she gave him just before they kissed, or right afterward. It was strangely inviting, even though it lacked the usual sharpness or laughter and wasn't particularly soft either. Just like every other time he'd seen those eyes, a thrill went through his body. The irritation that was simmering dangerously just moments ago was instantly forgotten, and he wanted to grab her and kiss her right then and there. He wanted to apologize for upsetting her and promise that he would never do it again. The realization that this situation was utterly ridiculous and that he hadn't done anything wrong nor did he have anything to be sorry for stopped him from acting on his sudden urge. Instead he looked back at Asuka in silence.  
真嗣最终还是妥协了，转头看向她，准备迎接不可避免的事。但她眼中的神情并非他所预料。这一周他已多次见到这种眼神。那是她亲吻前或亲吻后给他的眼神。虽然少了平时的锐利或笑意，也不特别温柔，却异常诱人。每次看到这样的眼神，他都会感到一阵兴奋。刚才还在危险地酝酿的烦躁瞬间烟消云散，他想要抓住她，立刻吻她。他想为惹她生气而道歉，并承诺再也不会了。意识到这情况荒谬至极，自己既没做错什么，也没什么可道歉的，他才抑制住了这突如其来的冲动。于是他只是默默地回望着明日香。

Asuka sighed again. 明日香再次叹了口气。

"You really don't know." “你真的不知道。”

"So tell me." “那就告诉我吧。”

There was a moment of silence. Asuka avoided Shinji's eyes. She took several deep breaths, opening her mouth like she was about to say something, only to close it again. Her right hand fidgeted nervously with the plugsuit control at her wrist. At last, she shut her eyes and scrunched up her face, like she was about to jump off a diving board.  
沉默片刻后，明日香避开了真嗣的目光。她深吸了几口气，张开嘴似乎要说些什么，却又闭上了。她的右手紧张地摆弄着腕部的插入栓服控制器。最终，她闭上眼睛，皱起脸，仿佛即将从跳水板上跃下。

"I don't think you're committed enough to me," she said to the table. Her voice was curiously small.  
“我觉得你对我的投入还不够，”她对着桌子说道，声音出奇地小。

Shinji blinked, and then fought the urge to bury his head in his hands. He only partially succeeded; they managed to cover his mouth. Frustration overwhelmed him. He wanted to know how exactly Asuka had come to that conclusion. He couldn't figure out how he should react to her words.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，然后强忍住把头埋进双手的冲动。他只成功了一半；手最终遮住了他的嘴。挫败感淹没了他。他想知道明日香究竟是如何得出这个结论的。他无法确定该如何回应她的话。

His commitment was blindingly obvious, wasn't it? Handing over the damn letter was, in his opinion, a blaring neon sign proclaiming exactly how _committed_ he was to Asuka Langley Soryu. It should have been enough. He felt everything was set in stone by that. Should he say so? That everything was decided for him at that point? Or should he say something else? Or should he reach out and put his arms around her waist and hug her?  
他的决心显而易见，不是吗？在他看来，递出那封该死的信就像是一个刺眼的霓虹灯招牌，明明白白地宣告了他对惣流·明日香·兰格雷的执着。这本应足够了。他觉得一切就此定局。他该这么说吗？一切在那刻已成定局？还是该说点别的？或者他应该伸出手臂，环抱住她的腰，紧紧拥抱她？

Whenever he'd been brave with physical contact, things had gone well with her. That was something worth pondering, but he didn't have time for that now, so he acted on it, reaching out to Asuka. It couldn't be worse than any of the other options at the moment. She hesitated, and didn't respond as Shinji's arm wrapped around her waist, but only moments later she relaxed, pressing herself against him. Their suits squeaked as they made contact.  
每当他在身体接触上表现出勇气时，事情总能与她相处得很好。这值得深思，但他现在没有时间去细想，于是他依此行动，向明日香伸出手。这总不会比其他选择更糟。她犹豫了一下，没有立即回应，但不久后她放松下来，紧贴着他。他们的战斗服在接触时发出了摩擦声。

The fact that this had become so natural and familiar for both of them aroused Shinji, more so than the act itself. So much had changed between them in such a short time, and it frightened him at times like this. He tried to angle his hips away from her in a futile attempt to hide the obvious. Asuka was hurting, and here he was thinking filthy thoughts. If she saw it she'd be disgusted. She'd push him away, and be even more hurt than she already was, and -  
这一行为对他们来说变得如此自然和熟悉，这让真嗣感到兴奋，甚至超过了行为本身。在如此短的时间内，他们之间发生了太多变化，有时这让他感到害怕。他试图调整臀部远离她，徒劳地试图隐藏显而易见的事实。明日香正受伤，而他却在想着肮脏的事情。如果她看到了，她会感到厌恶。她会推开他，受到比现在更深的伤害，而且——

And Asuka lifted her leg and climbed onto Shinji's lap.  
明日香抬起腿，跨坐在真嗣的腿上。

Shinji froze. He didn't dare to so much as breathe. Their plugsuited thighs squeaked and creaked against each other as Asuka adjusted herself. Her knees bracketed his hips. Her ass rested heavily on top of his thighs. Her weight crushed his body into the couch. Her proximity crushed his soul into oblivion. They had been closer than this when they kissed. But she had never sat in his lap before. Not like this, with her legs spread open on top of him. Shinji tried to swallow, but his mouth was dry. Wearing a plugsuit had never been more painful in his life. All he had to do was tilt his hips a little, and…  
真嗣僵住了。他连呼吸都不敢。他们的插入栓服大腿相互摩擦，发出吱吱嘎嘎的声音，明日香调整着自己的姿势。她的膝盖夹在他的臀部两侧。她的臀部沉重地压在他的大腿上。她的体重将他的身体压进沙发里。她的接近将他的灵魂压入虚无。他们接吻时比这更亲密。但她从未像这样坐在他的腿上，双腿张开在他上方。真嗣试图吞咽，但他的嘴巴干涩。穿着插入栓服从未像此刻这样痛苦。他只需稍微倾斜一下臀部，然后……

Asuka put her hands on Shinji's shoulders and looked down at him. Shinji felt from his arm that her stomach was tightening. She narrowed her eyes. When she spoke her voice was small and full of hesitation.  
明日香将双手搭在真嗣的肩上，低头看着他。真嗣从她的手臂感觉到她的腹部在收紧。她眯起了眼睛。当她开口时，声音小而充满犹豫。

"Why aren't you touching me?"  
“为什么你不碰我？”

And just like that, she managed to baffle him once again. He tightened his grip on the small of Asuka's back, reflexively blurting out the first thing that came to his mind.  
就这样，她又一次让他感到困惑。他本能地收紧了放在明日香腰间的手，脱口而出脑海中浮现的第一句话。

"I'm touching you right now."  
"我现在就在触碰你。"

And then he recalled the events of today at home, and understood what Asuka meant. Her words confirmed Shinji's thoughts.  
然后他回想起今天在家中的种种，明白了明日香的意思。她的言语证实了真嗣的想法。

"I'm not talking about _there,_ idiot."  
"我不是说那里，笨蛋。"

He felt himself twitch at those words. Thinking he had earned it this time, Shinji gritted his teeth and groaned. Asuka tilted her head slightly at him, then slowly leaned into him. Her chest was dangerously close to his face. The angle gave him a complete view of the orange plastic cups and the flesh they gripped. Shinji pulled back. It was all too much. Would she be angry if he decompressed his suit? he wondered wildly. But if he did then it'd be even more obvious. And what if it tipped forward and…  
听到这些话，他不由自主地抽搐了一下。想着这次总算有所收获，真嗣咬紧牙关，低声呻吟。明日香微微侧头看向他，然后缓缓向他靠近。她的胸部危险地贴近他的脸。这个角度让他完全看到了那些橙色的塑料杯以及它们所紧握的肌肤。真嗣后退了一步。这一切太过分了。如果他解压自己的装甲服，她会生气吗？他疯狂地想着。但如果他这么做，那就更加明显了。万一它向前倾倒，然后……

Asuka's forehead wrinkled and her eyebrows drew together.  
明日香的额头皱起，眉毛紧锁。

"So you really hate them, is that it?"  
“所以你真的讨厌它们，是吗？”

Then, as if to find an answer to her question, Asuka looked down to check out Shinji's lower body. Shinji blushed and tried to pull his hips back, but such a thing was impossible with Asuka's body right on top of his thighs. Trapped, Shinji turned his head to the table and fumbled for words, praying they came out in a semi-coherent order.  
随后，仿佛要寻找问题的答案，明日香低头查看真嗣的下身。真嗣脸红了起来，试图将臀部往后缩，但在明日香的身体紧压在他大腿上的情况下，这根本不可能。被困住的他转向桌子，结结巴巴地寻找合适的词句，祈祷它们能以半连贯的顺序说出来。

"Asuka, I, I appreciate, really, all of this, but I, I mean, I really appreciate you doing this for me, but -"  
“明日香，我，我很感激，真的，这一切，但我的意思是，我真的非常感谢你为我做这些，但是——”

Asuka's hand shot up and grabbed Shinji's chin, yanking him to face her. Shinji briefly stared at her breasts, then quickly looked up at her face. She was staring at him expressionlessly. That was far more frightening than the scowl he saw earlier.  
明日香的手迅速抬起，抓住真嗣的下巴，将他拉向自己。真嗣短暂地盯着她的胸部，然后迅速抬头看向她的脸。她面无表情地盯着他。这比之前看到的皱眉更令人害怕。

"What do you mean by that?"  
"你那话是什么意思？"

Shinji tried to swallow and failed. The lounge was reasonably cool with the air conditioning on, but stuck together like this, the heat was overwhelming. Shinji desperately tried to look anywhere but at her, feeling he would get sucked into Asuka's eyes if he didn't. They glowed deep blue like twin sinkholes under the dim light.  
真嗣试图吞咽口水，却失败了。休息室里空调开着，还算凉爽，但这样紧贴在一起，热度却难以承受。真嗣拼命地试图看向别处，生怕一不小心就会被明日香的双眼吸进去。在昏暗的灯光下，她的眼睛深邃如蓝宝石，仿佛一对深不见底的漩涡。

"Literally. I mean, that's what I mean, ah, literally that. I appreciate that you're willing to let me, um, touch you but you don't have to put yourself through that. I understand it feels good to confirm that I like you in that way, but you really don't have to. I won't be mad. You don't have to put up with something you don't like for me either. I'll," Shinji swallowed again. "I'll do better. I'll do better, Asuka."  
"字面意思。我是说，我指的是字面上的那个意思。我感激你愿意让我，呃，触碰你，但你不必为此勉强自己。我知道确认我喜欢你这一点感觉很好，但你真的不必这么做。我不会生气的。你也不必为了我忍受不喜欢的事情。我会，""真嗣再次吞咽了一下。""我会做得更好。我会做得更好，明日香。"

Asuka's shoulders slumped, and her hands on Shinji's shoulders slipped away.  
明日香的肩膀垂了下来，她搭在真嗣肩上的双手也滑落了。

"So you really don't have a clue."  
“所以你真的毫无头绪。”

Asuka's voice was almost sad. Shinji couldn't understand her reaction, which was a consistent occurrence for some time. "Asuka?"  
明日香的声音几乎带着悲伤。真嗣无法理解她的反应，这种情况已经持续了一段时间。“明日香？”

Asuka shook her head. "What makes you think I wouldn't like it?"  
明日香摇了摇头。“你怎么会觉得我不喜欢呢？”

_Why would you like it? Me getting blinded with lust and groping you might feel good to me, but why would you feel the same?_ Shinji wanted to ask, but doing so would serve as a verbal confirmation of his base desires for Asuka.  
你为什么会喜欢？我被欲望蒙蔽双眼，对你上下其手，对我来说或许感觉不错，但你为何会有同样的感觉？真嗣想问，但那样做无异于口头确认了他对明日香的基本欲望。

So Shinji kept his silence, making Asuka frown.  
于是真嗣保持沉默，这让明日香皱起了眉头。

"Where did that boy who humped me during our first kiss go? I miss him. You're a really shitty substitute. Are you a man or not?"  
"那个在我们第一次接吻时扑倒我的男孩去哪儿了？我想他了。你真是个糟糕的替代品。你到底是不是男人？"

That cut him deep. Heat rose to Shinji's face and his entire body stiffened. Asuka stiffened too, seeing his face. He must have failed to hide his anger. But the next moment a corner of her mouth curled up in amusement.  
这话深深刺痛了他。真嗣的脸颊热辣辣的，全身僵硬。看到他的表情，明日香也僵住了。他一定没能掩饰住自己的愤怒。但下一刻，她嘴角一挑，露出了戏谑的笑容。

"Yeah, whatever you want to do, just do it, like you did back then. Don't hesitate, okay? I gave you permanent consent that day. I expect you to take full advantage of it. If you have any doubts, just push them away and do whatever you want. Even if I say no once or twice, ignore it. That's part of the fun. I'll forgive you for anything. Why do I even have to tell you this?" Asuka smirked. "Are you seriously that clueless?"  
"是啊，不管你想做什么，就去做吧，就像那时候一样。别犹豫，好吗？那天我给了你永久的许可。我希望你能充分利用它。如果有任何疑虑，就把它们推开，做你想做的。即使我一两次说不，也别理会。那是乐趣的一部分。我会原谅你的一切。我为什么要告诉你这些？""明日香轻蔑地笑了笑。""你真的那么无知吗？"

That was weird. Very weird. Shinji couldn't quite put his finger on it, or explain it well, but he definitely felt that something was wrong with Asuka's words. And he still hadn't received an explanation for why Asuka would want it, or like it, or why it was 'mean' for Shinji to refuse it. But to another part of him, those things felt trivial at this point. Asuka had just opened a door that Shinji had been killing himself trying to keep closed, and his mind was wondering what exactly waited for him beyond the threshold. He knew he wanted it, even though he didn't have a clear image of what exactly 'it' entailed.  
这很奇怪，非常奇怪。真嗣无法确切指出问题所在，也无法很好地解释，但他确实感觉到明日香的话有些不对劲。而且他仍然没有得到明日香为何想要它、喜欢它，或者为什么真嗣拒绝它是‘刻薄’的解释。但在他内心的一部分看来，这些事情在这个时候显得微不足道。明日香刚刚打开了一扇真嗣拼命试图保持关闭的门，他的思绪在想门外究竟等待着他什么。他知道自己想要它，尽管他并不清楚‘它’具体包含什么。

Asuka's hand slapped Shinji's shoulder, cutting off his train of thought. He found her looking down at him, her face full of expectation. Her bottom lip was caught in her teeth. The sight made his head spin.  
明日香的手拍在真嗣的肩膀上，打断了他的思绪。他发现她正低头看着他，脸上满是期待。她的下唇被牙齿咬住。这一幕让他头晕目眩。

"So?"

Shinji hadn't completely lost his mind, though. "Not now. Not here."  
不过，真嗣并没有完全失去理智。“现在不行，这里也不行。”

"Making up excuses aga-" "编造借口又-"

Shinji shook his head, interrupting Asuka. "I'm not making up anything. What if someone walks in?"  
真嗣摇了摇头，打断了明日香。“我没有编造什么。万一有人走进来怎么办？”

"Why would anyone walk in here?"  
“怎么会有人走进这里？”

"Did you forget we're on standby because of the Angel? What if there's an emergency? Ms. Maya or Ms. Misato could be here any minute."  
“你忘了我们因为使徒而处于待命状态吗？万一有紧急情况怎么办？玛雅小姐或美里小姐随时可能到这里来。”

"Are you an idiot? If there's an emergency they'll broadcast it, or call us, not send someone running all the way down here. That's stupid." Asuka pointed to the speaker in the ceiling and then the phone on the table at the far corner of the lounge.  
“你是傻瓜吗？如果有紧急情况，他们会广播或者打电话给我们，而不是派人一路跑下来。那样太蠢了。”明日香指了指天花板上的扬声器，然后又指向休息室远角桌子上的电话。

Her argument was incredibly convincing. Shinji desperately searched for something, anything he could prop up as another line of defense. Maybe he really was making up excuses. He blurted out the first thing that popped into his head.  
她的论点极具说服力。真嗣拼命寻找任何可以作为另一道防线的理由。也许他真的只是在找借口。他脱口而出脑海中浮现的第一个念头。

"Ayanami will be back soon."  
“绫波很快就会回来。”

With their bodies so close, he could feel her body stiffen hard against his. He swallowed back the apology that shot to the top of his throat, knowing he didn't do anything wrong. Still, he felt he had to make amends somehow.  
他们的身体如此贴近，他能感觉到她的身体在他身上变得僵硬。他咽下了冲到喉咙的道歉，知道他并没有做错什么。然而，他仍觉得必须以某种方式弥补。

But how? As Shinji pondered, Asuka pulled away from him and plopped down on the couch. The heavy pressure on his legs disappeared, and the heat receded too. A chilly gust from the air conditioner wafted across his body, making him shiver.  
但该怎么做呢？正当真嗣思索时，明日香从他身边抽离，一屁股坐在沙发上。压在他腿上的沉重感消失了，热度也随之退去。空调吹来一阵寒风，拂过他的身体，让他打了个寒颤。

"Yeah, I almost forgot. The First." Asuka scrunched her face. "I hate that bitch."  
“是啊，我差点忘了。那个‘第一’。”明日香皱起脸。“我讨厌那个婊子。”

It was Shinji's turn to be mortified. He had a hunch that the Ayanami issue would one day explode, but he didn't know it would happen this quickly. He had no idea how to handle it.  
轮到真嗣感到尴尬了。他早有预感绫波的问题总有一天会爆发，但没想到会这么快。他完全不知道该如何应对。

"Asuka... why do you hate Ayanami so much?"  
“明日香……你为什么这么讨厌绫波？”

Asuka didn't even pretend to hear Shinji's question. "You like her, don't you?"  
明日香连假装听到了真嗣的问题都懒得做。“你喜欢她，对吧？”

_You hate it when I answer your questions with a question._ He was irritated, but it wasn't something he could do anything about.  
你讨厌我总是用问题来回答你的问题。他感到烦躁，但这不是他能改变的事情。

"Of course, Ayanami is my…" Shinji's toes wiggled hard, making a sharp _squeak_ with the sole of the plugsuit. "No, I mean, not like that, we're not a thing. I mean, we _are_ something, but..."  
“当然，绫波是我的……”真嗣的脚趾用力蜷缩，插座服的鞋底发出尖锐的吱吱声。“不，我是说，不是那样的，我们不是那种关系。我是说，我们是有些什么，但是……”

Asuka turned her head toward the door, avoiding Shinji's eye. "She's your friend you mean, right?"  
明日香转向门口，避开了真嗣的目光。“她是你朋友，你是这个意思吧？”

_Friend_ wasn't enough. Rei Ayanami was more than that to him. But now was not the time to explain it. Nor was he sure if there would ever be a right time. He knew he was not that eloquent. So he just smiled helplessly and nodded.  
朋友这个词远远不够。绫波零对他来说远不止如此。但此刻并非解释的时机。他也不确定是否会有合适的时机。他知道自己并不擅长言辞。所以他只是无奈地笑了笑，点了点头。

"Yeah, Ayanami is a friend. Someone I've been fighting with since before you came here." Shinji belatedly realized the last part wasn't necessary and fumbled for something else to say. "You're the one I'm kissing, aren't you?"  
“是啊，绫波是个朋友。从你来这里之前，我们就一直在并肩作战。”真嗣后知后觉地意识到最后那部分并不必要，急忙寻找其他话题。“你才是我要亲吻的人，对吧？”

_It was Ayanami you groped, while refusing to do the same to Asuka,_ he realized suddenly. At the same time, Asuka turned sharply to face him, which made him almost panic, thinking she had somehow read his mind or that he'd accidentally blurted that out. Shinji hastily put up an awkward smile, and tried to pull her towards him with the hand that had still been resting awkwardly on her side. Asuka resisted for a moment, snorting, but there was a hint of a smile on her lips. He felt like his heart was melting at the sight. The awkward laugh became real as the game of tug and pull intensified. After a few tries, Asuka gave in and climbed back onto Shinji's lap, and they were within kissing distance again.  
他突然意识到，自己摸的是绫波，而对明日香却避之不及。与此同时，明日香猛地转过身来面对他，这让他几乎慌了神，以为她读懂了他的心思，或是他不小心说了出来。真嗣急忙挤出一个尴尬的笑容，试图用那只还尴尬地搭在她腰间的手将她拉向自己。明日香一时抗拒，哼了一声，但嘴角却露出一丝笑意。他觉得自己的心都要融化了。随着拉扯游戏的加剧，尴尬的笑声变得真实起来。经过几次尝试，明日香终于屈服，重新坐回真嗣的腿上，两人再次近到可以接吻的距离。

"Honestly, I don't know what's wrong with you, Asuka. About the Ayanami thing, I mean."  
“老实说，我不知道你到底怎么了，明日香。我是说绫波那件事。”

Asuka pursed her lips. _Maybe that was too bold,_ he thought, cringing inwardly.  
明日香抿了抿嘴唇。也许那话说得太直白了，他想，内心一阵懊恼。

"I could tell you why I do that... but then you'd hate me," Asuka said. "Or you'd probably think badly of me."  
"我可以告诉你我为什么这么做...但那样你会恨我的，" 明日香说。"或者你可能会对我有不好的看法。"

There was something about Asuka's low voice that felt strangely familiar. After a moment's thought, he realized it was the same voice she used when she was being honest, in the moments when they truly connected and progressed. Realizing this was serious, Shinji hurried to seize the chance.  
明日香低沉的声音中有种奇怪的熟悉感。经过片刻思考，他意识到这是她在诚实表达时使用的声音，在那些他们真正连接并取得进展的时刻。意识到这是认真的，真嗣急忙抓住这个机会。

"Tell me, Asuka. It's okay."  
"告诉我，明日香。没关系的。"

Asuka's eyes were full of doubt. He cursed his lack of eloquence. If he was more confident and had a way with words, he would have told her that he had handed himself over to her the moment he handed over that damn letter, and that she could be more honest with him. That there was nothing to be afraid of. He wished he could say those things without sounding corny or clingy. But he couldn't, so all those things just stayed locked inside of him, for better or worse.  
明日香的眼中充满了疑惑。他咒骂自己口拙。如果他更自信、能言善辩，他本可以告诉她，自从交出那封该死的信的那一刻起，他就将自己交给了她，她可以对他更坦诚。没有什么好害怕的。他希望自己能说出这些话而不显得俗气或黏人。但他做不到，所以这些话只能被锁在他心里，无论好坏。

Maybe he should speak with actions if he couldn't with words. Kiss her, maybe. Or touch her breasts like she practically demanded him to earlier. Shinji was considering it very seriously when she finally sighed.  
也许如果他不能用言语表达，就应该用行动来说话。亲吻她，也许。或者像她之前几乎要求的那样触摸她的胸部。真嗣正在认真考虑这一点，这时她终于叹了口气。

"You don't look at me like you look at her."  
“你看着我的眼神不像看着她那样。”

_What?_ He didn't remember making a particularly different expression just for Ayanami. Asuka continued.  
什么？他并不记得自己曾为绫波特意做出过什么特别的表情。明日香继续说道。

"You have a certain look on your face when you're with her, and a voice you only use with her. You don't look at me like that. You don't talk to me like that. I can't stand it." Asuka shook her head and lifted one hand to stroke Shinji's hair, but to Shinji, the touch felt as if someone other than him was receiving it. It was barely perceived.  
“你和她在一起时脸上会有特定的表情，用一种只对她用的声音。你从不用那种眼神看我。你从不用那种语气对我说话。我受不了。”明日香摇了摇头，抬起一只手轻抚真嗣的头发，但对真嗣来说，这触感仿佛是别人在承受。几乎难以察觉。

"Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying there isn't something special between us. There's this look you get when you kiss me, and I love it, but... I hate the fact that there's one thing I don't get from you. I hate that there's something you're not giving me. It feels like a part of you is being taken away from me, and I hate that."  
“别误会。我不是说我们之间没有特别的东西。你亲吻我时的那种眼神，我很喜欢，但是……我讨厌你身上有我得不到的东西。我讨厌你有东西不给我。感觉像是你的一部分被夺走了，我讨厌这样。”

Asuka stopped her hand and closed her eyes tightly. "And I know it's not the First's fault, but... if I don't get mad at her, the only other alternative is to get mad at you, and I don't want to do that, so... I pick fights with her, I want to hurt her. Even when I know she doesn't deserve it. Well, okay, you're not the _only_ reason that I hate her, but still.  
"明日香停下手，紧紧闭上了眼睛。“我知道这不是初号机的错，但是……如果我不对她发火，唯一的选择就是对你发火，而我不想那样做，所以……我找她麻烦，我想伤害她。即使我知道她不该受这些。好吧，你不是我恨她的唯一原因，但仍然是原因之一。”

"Now tell me. Tell me how I'm toxic. That I'm full of crap and don't deserve…" Asuka swallowed once. "Anything."  
"“现在告诉我。告诉我我有多毒。说我满口胡言，不配……”明日香咽了一下。“得到任何东西。”

The intensity of the blue flame burning in Asuka's eyes made Shinji speechless. The usual beauty of them had been twisted, almost deformed. She was looking somewhere just beyond him, but a roiling mass of resentment and hatred and other, less definable things were clearly visible at this distance.  
明日香眼中燃烧的蓝色火焰之强烈，让真嗣哑口无言。她那平时的美丽已被扭曲，几乎变形。她的目光似乎穿透了他，直视着远方，但那股翻腾的怨恨、憎恶和其他难以名状的情绪，在这个距离下清晰可见。

Before, he would have been repulsed by it, and honestly he still was to some extent. But these days he saw a glimpse of something beyond that prickly veil, something only visible in the small sweet moments when they confirmed their feelings to one another. That's why Shinji was able to shake his head slowly, ignoring all the instincts inside him shouting that he should push this girl away, that he should keep a safe distance from this dangerous, unstable ball of problems.  
曾经，他会对此感到厌恶，坦白说，现在他仍然在某种程度上感到不适。但如今，他透过那层尖锐的屏障，瞥见了背后的一些东西，那是在他们彼此确认心意时短暂而甜蜜的瞬间才能看到的。正因为如此，真嗣才能缓缓摇头，无视内心所有呼喊着让他推开这个女孩、让他与这个充满危险和问题的不稳定球体保持安全距离的本能。

"No, I won't." “不，我不会。”

Asuka shook Shinji's head. "It's okay. It's true. I can't help it if you feel that way."  
明日香摇了摇真嗣的头。“没关系。这是真的。如果你那样感觉，我也无能为力。”

"No, Asuka. I'm not going to say that, I'm..." Shinji caught his voice as it started to dip into a whine, and gathered his courage. "I'm going to kiss you until you change your mind and beg me to stop."  
“不，明日香。我不会那么说的，我……” 真嗣及时止住了自己即将变成哀求的语气，鼓起勇气。“我要吻到你改变主意，求我停下来为止。”

_I actually said that._ Shinji was shocked by his own audacity. But then again, this whole situation was insane anyway. Giant monsters. Robots. A beautiful girl who wanted to kiss him. What was truly hard to believe was the particular emotion that Asuka's words implied. It was one he knew very well, and one he never in his wildest dreams would have expected Asuka to experience too. He stared up at her, marveling.  
我真的那么说了。真嗣被自己的大胆震惊了。但话说回来，整个情况本来就很疯狂。巨型怪兽。机器人。一个想吻他的美丽女孩。真正难以置信的是明日香的话所暗示的特定情感。他对此非常熟悉，而且他做梦也没想到明日香也会经历这种情感。他抬头凝视着她，惊叹不已。

Insecurity? _Seriously?_ 不安全感？真的吗？

Asuka's hand let go of Shinji's hair, and the fire dissipated in her eyes at the same time. Her lips twitched, as if wanting to say something but couldn't, just opening and closing several times. Asuka averted her gaze for a moment, and when she spoke again, her voice was slightly hoarse.  
明日香松开了握着真嗣头发的手，眼中的火焰也随之消散。她的唇角微微抽动，似乎想说些什么却又说不出口，只是张合了几次。明日香移开视线片刻，再次开口时，声音略显沙哑。

"But you said you wouldn't do it. Kissing."  
“但你说过你不会那么做的。接吻。”

Shinji couldn't help but laugh. The idea of Asuka wanting him this badly was still entirely foreign to him, but it felt so good. It tickled his heart and put a smile on his mouth.  
真嗣忍不住笑了起来。明日香如此渴望他的想法对他来说依然十分陌生，但这种感觉却如此美好。它撩拨着他的心弦，让他的嘴角不由自主地上扬。

"I said I wasn't going to kiss you _now."_  
"我说过现在不会吻你。"

"When, then?" "那什么时候？"

"When we get home." "回家的时候。"

"When is that?" “什么时候？”

"When the battle's over...?"  
“战斗结束之后……？”

As always, Misato would be busy for several days, even weeks, dealing with the aftermath, and Shinji and Asuka would have the house to themselves. That realization, coupled with Asuka's new 'proposal', made Shinji's face hot and his suit tighten once again.  
一如既往，美里会忙碌好几天，甚至几周，处理战后的种种事宜，而真嗣和明日香将独自待在家里。这一认识，加上明日香的新“提议”，让真嗣的脸颊发烫，西装再次感到紧绷。

Apparently Asuka was thinking similarly. She leaned toward him, smiling mischievously. Her hot breath tickled his cheek, paralyzing him.  
显然，明日香也在想类似的事情。她向他倾身，狡黠地笑着。她炽热的呼吸轻拂过他的脸颊，让他动弹不得。

"Say, when we're done with this and we're home alone, what are you going to do?"  
“喂，等我们完成这个任务，家里只有我们两个人的时候，你打算做什么？”

Shinji swallowed audibly. He didn't have a plan when he blurted that out. But then he remembered the last time they were home alone. Her undone blouse. Her exposed skin. The limitless possibilities.  
真嗣明显地咽了咽口水。他脱口而出时并没有计划。但随后他想起了上次他们单独在家时的情景。她未扣好的衬衫。她裸露的肌肤。无限的可能性。

He took a deep breath. "Well, we can think about that later..."  
他深吸了一口气。“好吧，我们可以晚点再考虑那个……”

"Oh, come on." Asuka sighed, squeezing Shinji's ear. "We could be dead in a few hours. Or worse, only one of us could die. Just…indulge a girl, would you?"  
“哦，拜托。”明日香叹了口气，捏了捏真嗣的耳朵。“我们可能几个小时后就会死，或者更糟，只有我们中的一个会死。就……满足一下我，好吗？”

Shinji almost smiled, but in the next moment the weight of the truth crushed him. He remembered being trapped in a narrow tunnel, unable to escape from that spider Angel's acid attack. The abject terror he'd felt before Asuka and Ayanami arrived. Or the crushing pressure of the volcano, something he thought he'd forgotten by now.  
真嗣几乎要笑了，但下一刻现实的沉重压垮了他。他想起了被困在狭窄隧道中，无法逃脱那蜘蛛使徒的酸液攻击。在明日香和绫波到来之前的极度恐惧。还有火山那令人窒息的压力，他以为自己已经忘记了。

Shinji had no idea what frightening abilities this new Angel from the sky might possess, or if Asuka, Shinji and Ayanami could all come out of this alive and whole. Maybe he really did owe something to Asuka. Shinji opened his mouth, the simple movement so laborious.  
真嗣对这位从天而降的新使徒拥有何种骇人能力一无所知，也不确定明日香、真嗣和绫波是否都能安然无恙地度过此劫。或许，他真的欠明日香一些东西。真嗣张开嘴，这个简单的动作竟如此费力。

"I'll do whatever you tell me to do."  
“我会照你说的去做。”

"Be more specific." “说得更具体些。”

More specific. At the thought of those specifics, his suit tightened painfully once more and he couldn't help the groan that escaped. They couldn't have been here for more than half an hour and he'd been varying degrees of hard for most of it, all while wearing a plugsuit. It made thinking difficult.  
更具体些。一想到那些细节，他的紧身衣再次痛苦地收紧，他忍不住发出了一声呻吟。他们在这里停留不超过半小时，而他大部分时间都处于不同程度的兴奋状态，全程穿着紧身衣。这使得思考变得困难。

"I, I'll do like you said. I'll touch you while we kiss."  
“我，我会按照你说的做。我们接吻时我会触摸你。”

Asuka closed her eyes, smiling. "Touch me where?"  
明日香闭上眼睛，微笑着。“触摸我哪里？”

Shinji swallowed hard and looked down at Asuka's body, which was barely a hand's length away.  
真嗣艰难地咽了口唾沫，低头看向离他仅一手之遥的明日香的身体。

"Your…your breasts." “你……你的胸部。”

Asuka made a noise that sounded suspiciously like a moan. Shinji took a deep breath and tried to calm himself, but it wasn't easy when the reason for his arousal was wriggling around on his lap. She grinned suggestively. It made Shinji want to faint.  
明日香发出了一声听起来像是呻吟的声音。真嗣深吸了一口气，试图让自己平静下来，但当让他兴奋的原因就在他的大腿上扭动时，这并不容易。她挑逗地笑了笑。这让真嗣几乎要晕过去。

"Is that so? How are you going to touch them, I wonder? It'd be a little difficult front to front like usual. Or maybe it'd be better like this, since there's plenty of wiggle room," she said, and shifted her hips on top of him. "Tell me how you want me, Shinji."  
"是吗？我倒想知道你怎么碰它们？像平时那样面对面可能有点困难。或许这样更好，因为有很多活动空间，" 她说着，在他上方扭动臀部。"告诉我你想要我怎样，真嗣。"

_On your back. On the bed, pinned beneath me. I'll make you stop teasing me. I'll kiss you so hard you won't be able to think straight._ He thought of the buttons on her blouse. And the buttons on her skirt. _And then I'll…_  
躺在床上，背对着我，被我压在身下。我会让你停止戏弄我。我会吻得你无法正常思考。他想着她衬衫上的扣子。还有她裙子上的扣子。然后我会……

It was all too much. Shinji's next breath was shaky. He bit his lip, afraid of what his body would do if he gave voice to his thoughts.  
这一切太过分了。真嗣的下一口气颤抖着。他咬住嘴唇，害怕如果将他的想法说出口，身体会做出什么反应。

To his chagrin, Asuka seemed to have no intention of letting the subject drop. She pressed her hands firmly on his shoulders, urging him on.  
令他懊恼的是，明日香似乎没有打算就此罢休。她双手紧紧按在他的肩膀上，催促着他继续。

"Come on, tell me." “来吧，告诉我。”

This was quickly becoming dangerous. Shinji shook his head and pulled back from her. "No, stop, Asuka."  
这情况很快变得危险起来。真嗣摇了摇头，从她身边退开。“不，停下来，明日香。”

"Why, it's not like I'm asking you to do it now. Is it that hard to just say what you're thinking?"  
"哎呀，我又没让你现在就做。表达一下你的想法有那么难吗？"

_Yes! I'm going to soil myself. Or rip the suit. Or the suit will break me!_ He took a deep, shuddering breath. Ayanami would be back soon. But he knew it was probably better to not mention her name right now. As he struggled to find something to say, Asuka giggled.  
是的！我会弄脏自己。或者撕破这身衣服。或者这衣服会把我弄坏！他深吸了一口气，身体微微颤抖。绫波很快就会回来了。但他知道现在最好不要提她的名字。在他努力寻找话题时，明日香轻声笑了起来。

"You should just tell me and end this, or I'm going to be on your lap until the First arrives."  
"你干脆告诉我，结束这一切，不然我就一直坐在你腿上，直到第一适格者回来。"

_And I was purposefully avoiding her name for you,_ he thought, almost smiling.  
我故意没提她的名字，他心想，几乎要笑出来。

Then Asuka's body suddenly stiffened and the smile left her face. "Shinji, you're not ashamed of being with me, are you?" she asked. "You made me feel like you were when we were with the First earlier."  
随后，明日香的身体突然僵硬起来，笑容也从她脸上消失了。“真嗣，你和我在一起不觉得羞耻吗？”她问道，“刚才和初号机在一起时，你让我感觉到了这一点。”

_What does that even mean?!_ Shinji wanted to ask, but didn't. He had a hunch that the question was a trap, a bomb rigged to explode at the slightest misstep. There was no trace of humor in her eyes anymore. Shinji couldn't keep up with how quickly her moods changed. At this rate, he was going to have to go back to the hospital due to a bad case of whiplash.  
这到底是什么意思？！真嗣想问，但没有开口。他有种预感，这个问题是个陷阱，一颗随时可能引爆的炸弹。她的眼中已没有一丝幽默。真嗣跟不上她情绪变化的节奏。照这样下去，他恐怕要因为严重的颈部扭伤而再次住院了。

Shinji was feeling very, very tired.  
真嗣感到非常非常疲惫。

"Eh... I don't think so."  
“呃...我不这么认为。”

Asuka's eyebrows drew together. "Why are you being so vague?"  
明日香的眉毛皱了起来。“你为什么这么含糊其辞？”

Shinji frowned, wondering if he wanted Ayanami, or anyone else for that matter, to see them like this, Asuka on his lap, her forehead nearly touching his, her hands resting on his shoulders, his hands on her waist.  
真嗣皱起眉头，疑惑自己是否希望绫波，或是其他人看到他们这副模样，明日香坐在他的腿上，额头几乎触碰到他的，双手搭在他的肩上，他的手则放在她的腰间。

"I don't want anyone else to see this," he murmured. "Not Ayanami. Not anyone."  
“我不想让任何人看到这一幕，”他低声说道，“不是绫波，也不是任何人。”

An uncomfortable silence fell. Shinji realized he had phrased it rather poorly, but he didn't know if he should correct it. After all, feeling ashamed of being in a relationship was entirely different from being ashamed of displaying too much affection in public. Asuka probably understood that.  
一阵尴尬的沉默降临。真嗣意识到自己的措辞相当不妥，但他不确定是否应该纠正。毕竟，对处于一段关系感到羞愧与在公共场合过度亲昵感到羞愧是完全不同的。明日香大概能理解这一点。

Then it occurred to him that she was making a big deal out of nothing all over again, and that tonight's drama was overstaying its welcome. Shinji felt he had reached a mental limit on this kind of thing. His erection, which up to now refused to subside, had died at some point during the past few minutes.  
然后他意识到她又在无事生非，今晚的闹剧已经过犹不及。真嗣觉得他对这种事情的心理承受已经到了极限。他那一直不肯消退的勃起，在过去的几分钟里不知何时已经消失了。

_Why can't we just hug and kiss and hold hands? Why does she have to make things so dramatic?  
为什么我们不能只是拥抱、亲吻和牵手呢？为什么她非要把事情搞得这么戏剧化？_

"If you're like this now, what are you going to do at school next week?"  
“如果你现在这样，下周在学校你打算怎么办？”

Shinji blinked, her words registering a little bit late. "Huh?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼，她的字句稍稍迟了些才传入脑海。“啊？”

"Your suspension's over now. You're supposed to go to school next week. Don't tell me we have to hide our relationship from the kids."  
“你的停学处分已经结束了。下周你得去上学。别告诉我我们得在孩子面前隐藏关系。”

Now Shinji was a little annoyed.  
这下真嗣有点恼了。

"That's not what I meant."  
"那不是我的意思。"

Asuka seemed to sense Shinji's anger. She subsided, but not without a few parting words.  
明日香似乎察觉到了真嗣的怒气。她安静了下来，但临走前还是说了几句。

"I'm not embarrassed," she proclaimed, and scooted a little closer to him on his lap. "Of you. Or of doing these things with you. I'll sit on your lap like this in front of anyone. You should let me, you know."  
“我并不觉得尴尬，”她宣称，并往他腿上挪近了一些。“对你，或是和你做这些事。我愿意在任何人面前这样坐在你腿上。你应该让我这么做，你知道的。”

Shinji sighed, and with it went the irritation that had been building in him. Asuka had a very cute look on her face, equal parts proud and smug. She was smiling at him. He couldn't stay mad at that. He smiled back at her. Her eyes were soft and very blue. The room was dim. Asuka was warm on top of him. _It would be nice to kiss her,_ he thought. _Just for a little while._  
真嗣叹了口气，随之消散的是在他心中积聚的不快。明日香脸上带着既骄傲又得意的可爱表情，正对着他微笑。他无法对她生气。他回以微笑。她的眼睛柔和而湛蓝。房间里光线昏暗。明日香在他身上温暖如斯。他想，亲吻她一会儿会是很美好的事。

As if reading each other's thoughts, Asuka and Shinji leaned towards each other, their eyes sliding shut.  
仿佛读懂了彼此的心思，明日香和真嗣向对方倾斜，双眼缓缓闭合。

Their noses collided instead of their lips. Asuka chuckled, her breath warm against his face.  
他们的鼻子先于嘴唇相撞。明日香轻笑出声，气息温暖地拂过他的脸庞。

"All traffic keep right. How many times do I have to tell you, idiot?"  
“所有车辆靠右行驶。我得告诉你多少遍，白痴？”

"But we're in Japan." "但我们现在在日本。"

"Just shut up and do as I say."  
"闭嘴，照我说的做。"

Shinji acquiesced, tilting his head to the right. Their mouths met.  
真嗣顺从地向右偏了偏头，两人的唇瓣相触。

They kissed gently, almost languidly. Shinji allowed himself to relax. He considered everything that had happened since he'd entered the lounge. He still needed time to digest all the things that were said. A lot of it gave him a feeling of unease in the pit of his stomach. He didn't agree with Asuka on everything, but he didn't want to argue anymore. There would be time for that later, if everything went well. Her mouth was soft and very warm. Then she nipped his lip, the unexpected pain of it making him gasp sharply. His mind flashed back to what she said earlier, and he wondered if he should try something more with his hands. But he already promised to do that later, so maybe he didn't need to do anything right now. Instead, Shinji focused his every sense on Asuka: the warm weight of her on top of him, her hands on his shoulders, the minute creaking sounds her plugsuit made as she moved, her sweet-smelling hair tickling the sides of his face, her hot breath, her mouth, opening beneath his like a flower, her tongue twining with his and her hand coming up to cup his cheek…  
他们轻柔地亲吻，几乎带着些慵懒。真嗣让自己放松下来。他回想起自从进入休息室以来发生的所有事情。他仍需要时间来消化那些被提及的一切。其中许多内容让他感到胃里一阵不安。他并非完全同意明日香的观点，但他不想再争论了。如果一切顺利，以后还有时间讨论。她的嘴唇柔软而温暖。随后她轻咬了他的唇，突如其来的疼痛让他猛地吸了口气。他的思绪闪回到她之前说的话，他不知道是否应该用手尝试更多。但他已经答应过稍后再做，所以也许现在不需要做任何事。相反，真嗣将所有的感官集中在明日香身上：她压在他身上的温暖重量，她的手搭在他的肩膀上，她的插入栓服在她移动时发出的细微吱吱声，她散发着甜香的发丝轻拂着他的脸颊两侧，她炽热的呼吸，她的唇，在他的唇下如花朵般绽放，她的舌头与他交缠，她的手抬起轻抚他的脸颊……

He heard the characteristic whoosh of an automatic door opening. Ayanami must have returned.  
他听到了自动门开启的特有呼啸声。绫波一定回来了。

Both Shinji and Asuka opened their eyes, frozen. Asuka was glancing sideways toward the door, an expression of acute distress on her face. Shinji almost reflexively turned his eyes in that direction too, but then remembered what Asuka said. She didn't care about being intimate like this in front of others, and she didn't want him to care either. So he wouldn't, at least for now, regardless of his own feelings on the matter. He was absolutely determined to prove himself to her, to reassure her. In an almost violent motion, Shinji brought his hand up, wrapped it around the back of Asuka's head, and pulled her down to him. Asuka's teeth slammed into Shinji's upper lip, breaking the skin, but that didn't stop Shinji from sucking on her lower lip.  
碇真嗣和明日香同时睁开了眼睛，僵住了。明日香斜眼瞥向门口，脸上流露出明显的痛苦表情。真嗣几乎本能地也朝那个方向看去，但随即想起了明日香的话。她不在乎在别人面前这样亲密，也不希望他介意。所以他不介意，至少现在不介意，不管他自己对此有何感受。他决心向她证明自己，让她安心。真嗣几乎是以一种粗暴的动作抬起手，绕过明日香的后脑勺，将她拉向自己。明日香的牙齿撞上了真嗣的上唇，划破了皮，但这并没有阻止真嗣吮吸她的下唇。

Asuka did not engage. Shinji felt an icy needle stabbing into his heart. He turned to the doorway.  
明日香没有回应。真嗣感到一阵冰冷的针刺入心脏。他转向门口。

A man was leaning awkwardly against the doorframe. He scratched the back of his head as he stepped into the lounge.  
一个男人尴尬地靠在门框上。他挠了挠后脑勺，走进了休息室。

"Well, looks like I've interrupted something."  
"嗯，看来我打扰了什么。"

Asuka shook her head quickly. "It's okay."  
明日香迅速摇了摇头。"没关系。"

The icy needle in Shinji's heart melted in a sudden, burning heat. His eye twitched involuntarily.  
冰针般刺痛真嗣心脏的感觉突然被一股炽热融化，他的眼角不由自主地抽搐了一下。

Ryoji Kaji glanced back and forth between them, then settled on Asuka, smirking. The awkwardness had already dissipated.  
加持良治来回打量着他们，最后目光落在明日香身上，嘴角勾起一抹笑意。那份尴尬已然消散。

"Long time no see, both of you. How are you feeling, Shinji? Heard a lot from Katsuragi."  
好久不见，你们俩。你感觉怎么样，真嗣？从葛城那里听到了不少你的消息。

Shinji swallowed, then nodded stiffly. "I'm fine, Mr. Kaji."  
真嗣咽了咽口水，然后僵硬地点了点头。"我很好，加持先生。"

"And you, Asuka. Haven't heard from you lately. Understandable, I know you're busy these days, but it's been two weeks."  
"还有你，明日香。最近都没听到你的消息。我理解你最近很忙，但已经两周了。"

Asuka gasped. Shinji didn't like that reaction at all. He didn't like the way she was nervously twisting her hair with her fingers nor the way she was blushing.  
明日香倒吸了一口气。真嗣一点也不喜欢她这种反应。他不喜欢她紧张地用手指绕着头发的样子，也不喜欢她脸红的样子。

"Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Kaji! I didn't do it on purpose. I just, I just…"  
"哦，对不起，加持先生！我不是故意的。我只是，我只是……"

_Why are you trailing off_, Shinji wanted to ask. _What is there to hide?_ But his mouth wouldn't open.  
为什么你欲言又止，真嗣想问。有什么好隐瞒的？但他的嘴就是张不开。

"Katsuragi asked me to get you kids some snacks," said Kaji. "Turns out there aren't any vending machines nearby. We'll have to go to the staff break room. I could've bought them myself but wasn't sure what you liked. Can you two spare a minute?"  
“葛城让我给你们这些孩子带些零食，”加持说，“结果发现附近没有自动贩卖机。我们得去员工休息室。我自己本来可以买的，但不清楚你们喜欢什么。你们俩能抽出一分钟吗？”

Asuka climbed off his lap and stood slowly. Shinji's limbs felt like wood. He didn't move. Asuka's face was still flushed. She looked almost embarrassed. Ashamed. Disgust filled his chest and hardened his face. Asuka shot him a questioning glance, but Shinji didn't return it. Kaji's shrug was a blur at the edge of his vision.  
明日香从他腿上爬下来，慢慢站起身。真嗣的四肢僵硬如木。他没有动。明日香的脸颊依旧泛红。她看起来几乎有些尴尬。羞愧。厌恶感充斥他的胸膛，让他的脸变得僵硬。明日香投来一个询问的眼神，但真嗣没有回应。加持的耸肩在他视野边缘模糊成一片。

"Suit yourself, Shinji. I have catching up to do with Asuka anyway."  
"随你吧，真嗣。反正我也得和明日香补上一些时间。"

Shinji gave him a small nod. "Thank you, Mr. Kaji."  
真嗣向他微微点头。"谢谢你，加持先生。"

Asuka glanced toward Kaji and then back to Shinji, but Shinji kept his gaze fixed on the table. Just before she crossed the threshold, Asuka glanced back at Shinji again. He didn't look at her.  
明日香瞥了加持一眼，然后又看向真嗣，但真嗣始终盯着桌子。就在她即将跨过门槛之前，明日香再次回头看向真嗣。他没有看她。

---

Asuka had walked and talked with Mr. Kaji countless times, but never once had she felt this awkward. Her cheeks warmed as she realized how thoroughly she'd forgotten about him. Her whole face flamed as she considered her past behavior towards him. Now that she'd gotten a taste of what a relationship with a boy could be like, it mortified her how brazenly she'd thrown herself at the man beside her, demanding things of him that she had no experience in and didn't really understand. Just like a child.  
明日香曾无数次与加持先生并肩而行、谈笑风生，但从未有一次像现在这般尴尬。当她意识到自己竟彻底忘记了他的存在时，双颊不禁发热。回想起过去对待他的种种行为，整张脸都涨得通红。如今尝到了与男孩交往的滋味，她为自己当初那般大胆地向身旁的男人索求无经验且不甚理解的事物而感到羞愧难当，简直像个不懂事的孩子。

Why did Mr. Kaji have to be the one who walked in on them?!  
为什么偏偏是加持先生撞见了他们？！

It was beyond embarrassing that she had reacted the way she did right after lecturing Shinji about not being ashamed of their actions. That was probably why Shinji got all sulky. He must have been angry at her. Disappointed, even.  
她刚刚才训斥过真嗣不要对自己的行为感到羞耻，结果自己却那样反应，实在是尴尬至极。这大概也是真嗣变得闷闷不乐的原因吧。他肯定是对她生气了，甚至可能感到失望。

She couldn't stop thinking about his cold, hard face. And she couldn't come up with a way to fix it.  
她无法停止思考他那冷酷坚硬的面容。而她想不出任何修复的方法。

Lost in worry, Asuka almost continued down the hall past Mr. Kaji, not noticing that he'd stopped. He looked at her quizzically, standing in front of the break room door. He pushed a button, opening it. There was a strange smile on his lips.  
沉浸在忧虑中的明日香几乎继续沿着走廊走过加持先生，没有注意到他已经停下。他站在休息室门前，好奇地看着她。他按下一个按钮，门打开了。他的嘴角挂着一丝奇怪的微笑。

"Did something happen between you two?" he asked. "I mean, aside from what I've seen?"  
“你们之间发生了什么事吗？”他问道，“我是说，除了我所看到的之外？”

As Asuka stood there, red-faced and sputtering like Shinji, Kaji gestured and stepped through the open door. Asuka quickly followed, chewing her lips.  
当明日香站在那里，脸红得像真嗣一样结巴时，加持示意了一下，便穿过敞开的门。明日香迅速跟上，咬着嘴唇。

The break room was empty, chilly, and dark. The only light came from the vending machines lining the opposite wall, their innards casting an eerie blue glow throughout the room. Mr. Kaji was standing contemplatively in front of one of the vending machines. Asuka came up beside him, frustration simmering inside her.  
休息室空无一人，冷清而昏暗。唯一的光源来自对面墙上的自动售货机，它们内部发出的幽蓝光芒笼罩着整个房间。加持先生正若有所思地站在一台自动售货机前。明日香走到他身边，内心的挫败感逐渐升腾。

Mr. Kaji pulled a card from his pocket and swiped it on one of the vending machines. With a beep, it lit up.  
加持先生从口袋里掏出一张卡片，在自动售货机上刷了一下。随着一声“哔”，机器亮了起来。

"So many different flavors for potato chips. Never understood why. Which do you want, Asuka?"  
薯片有这么多种口味，真搞不懂。你想要哪种，明日香？

Asuka scanned the brightly lit vending machine display with a frown. Sure enough, as he said, nearly half of the twenty something snacks on display were potato chips of the same brand. Asuka shook her head, not really in the mood to make a decision. "I don't care. Anything's fine."  
明日香皱着眉头扫视着灯火通明的自动售货机显示屏。果然，正如他所说，显示屏上二十多种零食中几乎有一半是同品牌的薯片。明日香摇了摇头，实在没心情做决定。“我无所谓，随便什么都行。”

Mr. Kaji chuckled. "Asuka, now that you're dating someone, let me give you a crucial tip. Most girls don't realize that boys really, really hate that word. _Anything_."  
加持先生轻笑道：“明日香，既然你现在在谈恋爱，那我给你一个关键提示。大多数女孩都没意识到，男孩们真的很讨厌这个词——随便。”

"Mr. Kaji, how..." "加治先生，怎么……"

Asuka trailed off abruptly, feeling like an idiot. He just saw her on top of Shinji Ikari. He saw everything there was to see. And Misato had probably told him all about the two of them. There wasn't a flicker of _anything_ on his face when he'd appeared in the doorway - not embarrassment, nor awkwardness, nor even dismay. And why would there be? Asuka thought about Shinji, the way he looked at her, the way he touched her, and realized that Mr. Kaji had never once paid her any kind of attention that even remotely resembled that. In fact, she thought, looking at him, at the angular planes of his face lit up by the harsh glow of the vending machine, at the stubble on his jaw and the distance in his eyes, he was probably relieved. The stupid little girl had finally gotten the hint and stopped pestering him and gone for someone her own age.  
明日香突然停了下来，觉得自己像个傻瓜。他刚刚看到她和碇真嗣在一起。他看到了所有该看的。而且美里可能已经把他们俩的事都告诉他了。当他出现在门口时，他的脸上没有一丝表情——没有尴尬，没有局促，甚至没有失望。为什么会有呢？明日香想起了真嗣，他看她的方式，他触碰她的方式，意识到加治先生从未对她有过任何类似的关注。事实上，她看着他，看着他那被自动贩卖机刺眼光芒照亮的棱角分明的脸庞，下巴上的胡茬和眼中的距离感，她想，他可能松了一口气。那个愚蠢的小女孩终于明白了暗示，不再纠缠他，而是选择了同龄人。

The thought was strangely piercing. A lump appeared in her throat. Why? What kind of person did that make her? Shinji was hers now. It shouldn't matter. It shouldn't.  
这个想法奇怪地刺痛了她。她的喉咙里出现了一个硬块。为什么？她是什么样的人？真嗣现在是她的了。这不应该重要。不应该。

Mr. Kaji smiled at her. She looked away. "Well. Then let's start with Shinji's. What flavor would he like?"  
加治先生朝她微笑。她移开了视线。“好吧。那我们先从真嗣的开始。他喜欢什么口味的？”

Asuka frowned, brought up short. What kind of snacks did Shinji like? She didn't know, and for some reason it overwhelmed her. Asuka stared at the display, then glanced at the vending machines lined up next to it. She saw soda machines. What kind of drinks did Shinji like?  
明日香皱起眉头，突然停住了。真嗣喜欢什么样的零食？她不知道，不知为何这让她感到不知所措。明日香盯着展示柜，然后瞥了一眼旁边的自动售货机。她看到了饮料机。真嗣喜欢喝什么饮料？

What were his hobbies? What things did he like? What did he dislike? What songs did he listen to on that damn cassette player all the time? She hadn't seen him wearing his earbuds as often lately, but they used to be in his ears almost constantly.  
他的爱好是什么？他喜欢什么？不喜欢什么？他总是在那该死的随身听里听什么歌？她最近不怎么见他戴耳机了，但以前他的耳朵几乎总是塞着耳机。

It was disconcerting to realize that she didn't know the answer to any of those questions. She forcefully pressed the button for salt-flavored chips, twice. One for Shinji, one for herself.  
意识到自己对这些问题一无所知，她感到不安。她用力按下盐味薯片的按钮，两次。一次给真嗣，一次给自己。

"His taste is so _booring._ He like things basic and plain." She made it up on the spot, but it sounded true enough. At least she thought so.  
“他的口味真无聊。他喜欢简单朴素的东西。”她即兴编造，但听起来足够真实。至少她自己是这么认为的。

Mr. Kaji burst out laughing. "Really? That's hard to believe. Wouldn't have guessed, given who he picked for a girlfriend."  
加持先生爆发出一阵大笑。“真的吗？这真让人难以置信。考虑到他选的女朋友，我可没想到会是这样。”

"Hey!" Even as she pouted and hit him in the arm, Asuka smiled, despite everything. Until a certain doubt she had buried deep inside her mind resurfaced. She didn't know what Shinji liked. She didn't know what made Shinji like _her._ It wiped the smile from her face as quickly as it appeared.  
"嘿！" 尽管她噘着嘴，捶打他的手臂，但明日香还是笑了，尽管一切都不如意。直到她内心深处埋藏的一个疑问重新浮现。她不知道真嗣喜欢什么。她不知道是什么让真嗣喜欢她。这个疑问迅速抹去了她脸上的笑容。

Mr. Kaji, intentionally or not, didn't give Asuka any time to get lost in thought.  
加持先生，有意无意地，没有给明日香任何陷入沉思的时间。

"Good. Now that we've dealt with these two...what do we buy for Rei?"  
"好。既然我们已经处理了这两个...我们该给绫波买什么呢？"

Asuka snorted. 明日香哼了一声。

"Does it matter? Just give her anything and say it's an order. Tell her that maintaining combat readiness is her most important duty as a pilot, blah blah blah, and she'll lap it up without question."  
"这有什么关系？随便给她点什么，就说这是命令。告诉她保持战斗准备是作为飞行员最重要的职责，blah blah blah，她会毫不怀疑地接受。"

Asuka pushed a random button without even looking at what she was pressing. What came out was smoked bacon flavored chips.  
明日香随意按了一个按钮，看都没看自己按的是什么。结果出来的是烟熏培根味的薯片。

Mr. Kaji shrugged and pulled a plastic bag out of his pocket, putting the three bags of chips in there. Then he bought three energy bars, along with a few Japanese snacks Asuka had never tried before. He didn't ask Asuka's opinion on those, and she was content to let him have his pick. When he finished bagging the snacks, he moved on to the soda machines, looking back at her.  
加持先生耸了耸肩，从口袋里掏出一个塑料袋，把那三包薯片放了进去。然后他又买了三根能量棒，还有一些明日香从未尝试过的日本零食。他没有征求明日香的意见，而她也很乐意让他自己挑选。当他把零食装好后，他又走向了汽水机，回头看了看她。

"I'll buy you a coffee, but don't drink it right away. You might have to stand by for a while, and there's a chance nothing will happen for the rest of the night. Might be better to just take a nap."  
"我给你买杯咖啡，但别急着喝。你可能得等上一阵子，今晚说不定什么都不会发生。不如先打个盹儿。"

Asuka frowned. "So we really don't know anything about this Angel?"  
明日香皱起眉头。"所以我们对这只使徒还是一无所知？"

"You might say that. All we know is that it's deployed its AT field and it's floating in orbit. And to top everything off, the Commander and Vice Commander are out of town, and we can't contact them because the Angel's AT field has messed up satellite communications."  
"可以这么说。我们只知道它展开了 AT 力场，正漂浮在轨道上。更糟糕的是，司令和副司令都出差了，我们联系不上他们，因为使徒的 AT 力场干扰了卫星通讯。"

He smiled wearily. "I'm glad Katsuragi was with me when they sounded the alarm, not with you kids at home. I doubt she could make her way here on her own without GPS."  
他疲倦地笑了笑。“幸好响警报时葛城在身边，而不是和你们这些孩子在家。我怀疑没有 GPS 她自己都找不到来这儿的路。”

Asuka's stomach tightened. She vaguely suspected - no, she _knew_ that Misato's frequent absences in the evenings these past weeks weren't always because of work, but having her suspicion actually confirmed felt like a bit of a slap in the face.  
明日香的胃一阵紧缩。她隐约怀疑——不，她知道美里最近几周晚上频繁不在家并非全是因为工作，但这种怀疑被证实的感觉就像被人扇了一巴掌。

Asuka grimaced. _Hypocrite,_ a voice whispered. Today, while Mr. Kaji and Misato were out there fooling around, she was doing her fair share of fooling around with Shinji. Nothing was unfair. It was for the best, even.  
明日香皱了皱眉。伪君子，一个声音低语道。今天，在加持先生和美里在外面鬼混的时候，她和真嗣也在做同样的事。没有什么不公平的。甚至可以说，这是最好的选择。

Asuka shook her head, dismissing the intrusive thoughts. She had never felt this uncomfortable spending time with Mr. Kaji before, and the change was neither expected nor welcomed.  
明日香摇了摇头，驱散了那些侵扰的思绪。她从未像现在这样与加治先生相处感到不适，这种变化既出乎意料也不受欢迎。

While Asuka was lost in thought, Mr. Kaji bagged several cans of coffee. "I hope that's enough?"  
当明日香陷入沉思时，加治先生装了几罐咖啡。“希望这够了吧？”

Asuka looked at the bulging plastic bag in the man's hand and nodded. He tilted his head a little.  
明日香看着男人手中鼓鼓的塑料袋，点了点头。他微微侧了侧头。

"Did you guys have a fight?"  
"你们吵架了吗？"

And just like that, the conversation was back at the beginning. She wondered if everything about the chips and the Angel had been an attempt on his part to give her some time to think about the issue before repeating the question. She sighed and shook her head.  
就这样，对话又回到了原点。她猜想，关于薯片和天使的一切，是否都是他有意为之，为了让她在重复这个问题之前有时间思考。她叹了口气，摇了摇头。

"What makes you say that? Didn't you literally catch us kissing?"  
"你为什么会这么想？你不是亲眼看到我们在接吻吗？"

That made him snort. 这让他嗤之以鼻。

"What does that have to do with anything? Who says you can't kiss your lover just because you had a fight? I mean, those kinds of things tend to be better after an argument. It's what Katsuragi and I -" He snapped his mouth shut in dismay. "Well."  
"这跟什么有关？谁说吵架了就不能亲吻爱人？我是说，那种事往往在争吵后会更好。就像我和桂木——" 他懊恼地闭上了嘴。"好吧。"

"Why? Stop treating me like a child. It's just kissing."  
"为什么？别把我当小孩对待。只是亲吻而已。"

Only after blurting that out did Asuka realize he probably didn't mean _just kissing._ Heat rose to her face, and at the same time she felt a rush of directionless anger. She hated that she really was still a child, flustered at the mere implication of something more than a kiss. She hated the image surfacing in her head, of Mr. Kaji and Misato embracing, naked and entangled, and she was disgusted with herself for hating it, because it made her feel sorry for Shinji. Asuka gritted her teeth.  
直到脱口而出那句话后，明日香才意识到他可能不仅仅是指接吻。热气涌上她的脸颊，同时她感到一阵无名的愤怒。她讨厌自己真的还是个孩子，仅仅因为暗示有更进一步的事情就慌了神。她讨厌脑海中浮现的画面，加岛先生和美里赤裸相拥、缠绵悱恻，她对自己因此产生的厌恶感到恶心，因为这让她为真嗣感到难过。明日香咬紧了牙关。

"I'm a grown woman now. I do things with Shinji, you know."  
“我现在是个成熟的女人了。我和真嗣做了些事，你知道的。”

Mr. Kaji had a strange look on his face. "If you say so."  
加岛先生脸上露出奇怪的表情。“如果你这么说的话。”

Asuka blinked. She had expected him to frown disapprovingly, maybe even admonish her, or at the very least advise her against it. _You shouldn't do adult things like that, Asuka. You're still a child._ He always treated her like a child, so it was hard to understand why he was giving in so easily now.  
明日香眨了眨眼。她本以为他会皱眉表示不赞同，甚至可能会训斥她，或者至少劝她不要这么做。‘你不应该做那种成年人的事，明日香。你还是个孩子。’他总是把她当孩子看待，所以很难理解为什么他现在这么轻易就答应了。

"You're not going to scold me or tell me off?"  
“你不会骂我或者训斥我吗？”

Mr. Kaji tucked the card into his pocket and picked up the plastic bag.  
加治先生把卡片塞进口袋，拿起塑料袋。

"I'm not sure if I'm qualified to give advice on teenage relationships."  
"我不确定自己是否有资格给青少年恋爱提建议。"

She frowned. Did he mean he'd never been in a relationship as a teenager? Asuka had a hard time believing that. She already knew how he would respond if she voiced such a question, probably something about Second Impact, just like the school trip. But that wasn't really convincing. Not getting to go on a school trip was totally different from not getting a girlfriend. Surely there were girls around him even after the Impact.  
她皱起眉头。他是指自己青少年时期从未谈过恋爱吗？明日香很难相信这一点。她已经知道如果她提出这样的问题，他会如何回答，大概会提到第二次冲击，就像那次学校旅行一样。但这并不太有说服力。没能参加学校旅行和没有女朋友完全是两码事。第二次冲击后，他身边肯定还是有女孩子的。

Mr. Kaji gestured at her and started toward the doorway.  
加持先生向她示意，然后朝门口走去。

He said nothing as he walked ahead of Asuka, a strange aura emanating from his back. It made Asuka keep her mouth tightly shut. It wasn't until they were in the elevator and the doors had closed behind them that he spoke again. There was nothing out of the ordinary about his voice when he talked, making Asuka wonder if she had misread things.  
他一言不发地走在明日香前面，背后散发出一种奇异的气场。这让明日香紧紧闭上了嘴。直到他们进入电梯，门在他们身后关闭，他才再次开口。他说话的声音并无异样，这让明日香怀疑自己是否误解了什么。

"Some might disagree, but I don't think it's all that bad."  
“有些人可能不同意，但我觉得这也没那么糟糕。”

"What's all that bad?" “什么没那么糟糕？”

"Using your body to reconcile with your lover."  
"用身体和解，与爱人和好。"

_Did you really have to say it like that?_ Asuka almost asked, feeling the heat rising in her face. She caught herself at the last moment. She couldn't, not right after claiming to be a grown woman. Mr. Kaji continued, perhaps taking Asuka's silence as disapproval or something. Or maybe he wanted to explain himself more.  
你非得说得这么直白吗？明日香几乎要问出口，只觉脸上热气腾腾。她在最后一刻忍住了。她不能，尤其是在刚刚宣称自己是个成熟女性之后。加持先生继续说道，或许把明日香的沉默当作了不赞同或其他什么。也可能他想进一步解释自己。

"Men and women are inherently incomprehensible to one another. That's the sad truth for us. Try as we might, we can only convey so much. Our sincerity, our thoughts, our affections, all of them can get lost or warped. But desire is honest. You can't truly hide or dismiss your desire in the end, nor is there any other way to interpret it. It's the most direct and effective way to show someone that you want them, that they occupy a place in the deepest part of your heart. It doesn't have to always be some big, crazy thing either, you know. Just sitting next to each other, holding hands. Hugging. Resting your head on their shoulder. Those things could be more than enough."  
"男女之间，本就难以相互理解。这是我们悲哀的真相。无论我们如何努力，能传达的终究有限。我们的真诚、思想、情感，都可能迷失或扭曲。但欲望是诚实的。最终，你无法真正隐藏或忽视你的欲望，也没有其他方式来解读它。这是向某人展示你想要他们、他们在你内心深处占据一席之地的最直接有效的方式。这并不一定非得是什么惊天动地的大事，你知道的。仅仅是坐在一起，牵手。拥抱。把头靠在他们的肩上。这些就足够了。"

Asuka considered his words, her eyes narrowed. At first, she thought he was being ridiculous, but the more she thought about it, the more she realized there was something strangely convincing in what he was saying.  
明日香思索着他的话，眼神变得锐利。起初，她觉得他简直荒谬，但越想越觉得他说的有些奇怪的说服力。

She recalled all the things that had happened between Shinji and herself. Come to think of it, physical contact was the deciding factor at almost every watershed moment between them so far. Holding hands in the hospital room, in the kitchen, hugging in her room, kissing in his room. _Maybe today's crisis could be solved that way,_ she thought.  
她回想起自己和真嗣之间发生的种种。仔细想想，几乎每一次关键时刻，身体接触都是决定性因素。在医院病房牵手，在厨房牵手，在她房间拥抱，在他房间接吻。也许今天的危机也能用这种方式解决，她想。

A small smile tugged at Aska's lips. _It doesn't have to always be big and crazy, you say? I don't think I agree with that, Mr. Kaji._  
明日香嘴角勾起一丝微笑。你说，不必总是大张旗鼓、疯狂至极？我不太同意，加持先生。

The elevator stopped. Once again, Mr. Kaji led the way. When they arrived in front of the pilot's lounge, he handed the bag to Asuka.  
电梯停了下来。又一次，加持先生领路前行。当他们来到飞行员休息室前，他将包递给了明日香。

"What are you going to do now, Mr. Kaji?"  
“你现在打算做什么，加持先生？”

"Report to Katsuragi, find some snug spot to sleep. You should get some rest, too, I think. Don't quote me on this, but it doesn't look like the battle is going to start anytime soon."  
“向葛城报告，找个舒服的地方睡觉。你也应该休息一下，我觉得。别引用我的话，但看起来战斗不会很快开始。”

As Asuka nodded and took the bag, Mr. Kaji winked and lowered his voice. "Make up with Shinji."  
当明日香点头接过袋子时，加持先生眨了眨眼，压低声音说：“和真嗣和好吧。”

Asuka smiled sheepishly. The man waved and strode away, and Asuka watched him until he disappeared around the corner. Then she turned to the door. She made a mistake, but nothing that couldn't be easily fixed. She pressed the button.  
明日香尴尬地笑了笑。他挥手告别，大步离去，明日香一直目送他消失在拐角处。然后她转向门口。她犯了个错误，但没什么不能轻易弥补的。她按下了按钮。

But the scene inside the lounge undermined her newfound resolve a bit.  
但休息室内的景象稍稍动摇了她刚找回的决心。

The First had returned, apparently, and was sitting in the exact same spot where she had been earlier, reading a book. She didn't even glance in Asuka's direction. On the next couch across from the entrance lay Shinji. He was lying sideways, facing the backrest of the couch, his face hidden from Asuka.  
第一适才归来，显然，正坐在她早先所在的确切位置，读着一本书。她甚至没有朝明日香的方向瞥一眼。入口对面的沙发上躺着真嗣。他侧身躺着，面向沙发的靠背，脸庞隐藏在明日香的视线之外。

Asuka walked to the table. Shinji didn't move, and the First hadn't looked up at her either. Asuka wondered if she could read at all in the half-lit dimness of the room, and if that was bad for her eyesight, but then realized she had no reason to care about any of that. She turned to Shinji.  
明日香走向桌子。真嗣没有动，第一也没有抬头看她。明日香想知道她在房间昏暗的光线下是否真的能阅读，这样是否对她的视力有害，但随即意识到自己没有理由关心这些。她转向真嗣。

"Hey, Shinji, are you sleeping?"  
“嘿，真嗣，你睡着了吗？”

Asuka didn't like how her voice sounded almost timid, but it wasn't exactly like she was proud of herself right now. She walked over to Shinji's couch. Shinji was still unresponsive, only his shoulders rising and falling silently as he breathed.  
明日香不喜欢自己的声音听起来几乎有些胆怯，但她现在也确实没什么值得骄傲的。她走向真嗣的沙发。真嗣依旧毫无反应，只有肩膀随着呼吸无声地起伏。

"Are you tired?" “你累了吗？”

This was definitely weird. He couldn't have fallen asleep already. Asuka set the plastic bag down on the table with a growing sense of unease. It was the last thing she wanted to do, but it looked like she had no choice but to activate Plan B.  
这绝对很奇怪。他不可能这么早就睡着了。明日香将塑料袋放在桌上，不安感逐渐加剧。虽然这是她最不想做的事，但看来她别无选择，只能启动 B 计划了。

"Hey, First. How long has he been like that? Is he sleeping?"  
“嘿，一助。他那样多久了？是在睡觉吗？”

First lifted her gaze from the book for the first time. "He had been like that since we heard your voice in the hallway. I was asked to say he was sleeping. If he is sleeping now or not, I do not know."  
一助首次从书本上抬起目光。“自从我们在走廊听到你的声音后，他就一直是那样。我被要求说他正在睡觉。至于他现在是否真的在睡，我不清楚。”

A small groan came from Shinji. Asuka frowned, having her worst fear confirmed. _Protesting, are you?_  
真嗣发出了一声轻微的呻吟。明日香皱起眉头，最坏的猜测得到了证实。你在抗议，是吗？

Realizing that confronting him now would only irritate him further and make things worse, Asuka plopped down on the couch across from him and noisily opened the bag of snacks. She wondered if offering him one would be enough to lure him out to talk. _Couldn't hurt to try,_ she thought, so she grabbed the first thing she touched. It was the bag of bacon-flavored potato chips. Asuka sighed in annoyance.  
意识到现在和他对峙只会让他更加恼火，使情况变得更糟，明日香一屁股坐在他对面的沙发上，大声地打开了一袋零食。她想知道，递给他一包零食是否足以引诱他出来谈谈。试试也无妨，她想，于是她随手抓起一样东西。那是袋培根味的薯片。明日香不耐烦地叹了口气。

"Hey, take this, First. It's yours."  
“嘿，拿着这个，第一。这是你的。”

The First peered over her book. Only after making Asuka almost explode with irritation did she put the damn thing down and accept the bag of potato chips from Asuka. Those creepy red eyes narrowed slightly as she read the package.  
第一从书本上抬起头来。直到让明日香几乎要爆发出怒火，她才终于放下那该死的书，从明日香手中接过那袋薯片。她那双诡异的红色眼睛微微眯起，看着包装袋。

"No. I will not eat this."  
“不，我不会吃这个。”

Asuka couldn't believe her ears. "What?!"  
明日香简直不敢相信自己的耳朵。“什么？！”

The First put down the chips on the table. "I don't like meat. I can't stand it."  
第一使徒放下桌上的薯片。“我不喜欢肉。我受不了它。”

_I'm here to talk with Shinji, not to deal with you, bitch_, Asuka thought with growing irritation. First the overpass and now this. The other girl had a way of getting under Asuka's skin like no one else she'd ever met. The only thing that stopped her from screaming profanity was Shinji's presence. The fact that she was restraining herself for the sake of someone else, even if that someone else was Shinji, started to piss her off even more. She would get this back from him with hefty interest, she promised herself, and then turned her thoughts to the best way to shut Wondergirl down.  
我来这里是和真嗣谈话的，不是来应付你这个婊子的，明日香心中愈发烦躁地想着。先是天桥，现在又是这样。那个女孩总有办法像没人能比似的触碰到明日香的底线。唯一阻止她破口大骂的是真嗣在场。为了别人，哪怕是真嗣，她克制自己的事实开始让她更加恼火。她暗自发誓，一定要从他那里连本带利讨回来，然后转念思考如何最好地让那个“奇迹女孩”闭嘴。

"Oh, would you look at that, the robot actually has an opinion! At the worst possible time! Wondergirl, we're on standby because of an Angel. It's your duty as a pilot to maintain your ability to fight and that includes eating stuff so you're not hungry. Don't play the picky eater, just take what you're given!"  
“哦，你看看，机器人居然还有意见！在最糟糕的时候！奇迹女孩，我们因为使徒而待命。作为驾驶员，保持战斗能力是你的职责，这包括吃东西以免饿肚子。别挑食了，给你什么就吃什么！”

The First's eyes narrowed ever so slightly. "Is that an order?"  
第一适格者的眼睛微微眯起。“这是命令吗？”

"Yeah! And your duty!" “是啊！还有你的职责！”

"Asuka, stop." “明日香，住手。”

There was something chilling about Shinji's voice that made Asuka's body freeze at once. Rubber creaked as he sat up and began fiddling with the plastic bag on the table. He did not look at her. It took Asuka a few moments to realize that what she'd just heard in his voice was a mixture of fatigue and frustration and…disgust? Asuka swallowed. She wasn't sure which was worse: that he'd talked to her in that tone of voice, or that she was frightened by it.  
真嗣的声音中有种令人毛骨悚然的东西，让明日香的身体立刻僵住了。当他坐起身来，开始摆弄桌上的塑料袋时，橡胶发出吱吱声。他没有看她。明日香花了片刻才意识到，她刚才从他的声音中听出的是疲惫、沮丧和……厌恶？明日香咽了咽口水。她不确定哪个更糟糕：是他用那种语气对她说话，还是她被那种语气吓到了。

While Asuka sat frozen in her own swirling thoughts, Shinji rummaged through the bag and soon took out his own potato chips, placing them on the table, right in front of the First.  
当明日香沉浸在自己纷乱的思绪中僵坐时，真嗣在包里翻找了一会儿，随即拿出了自己的薯片，放在桌上，正好摆在第一位的面前。

"Eat these, Ayanami." “吃这些吧，绫波。”

"I am not hungry right now."  
“我现在不饿。”

"Then you can eat them later."  
“那你可以晚点再吃。”

With that, Shinji resumed his previous position on the couch, his back turned towards her. He still did not look at her.  
说完，真嗣重新回到沙发上的原位，背对着她。他依然没有看她一眼。

Slowly, Asuka's irritation grew, almost to the point of matching her remorse. She started to wonder what she'd done was really that bad to warrant this mistreatment, and that made her feel even guiltier. Asuka impulsively launched herself to her feet and walked around the table, stopping right in front of Shinji. She didn't want her foul mood to consume her even more than it already had.  
渐渐地，明日香的不满情绪愈发强烈，几乎与她的悔恨不相上下。她开始怀疑自己所做的事是否真的那么糟糕，以至于遭受这样的对待，这让她感到更加内疚。明日香冲动地站起身，绕过桌子，停在真嗣面前。她不想让自己的坏心情再继续恶化下去。

"Hey, are you really that tired? I brought coffee. I also brought you some snacks, so let's eat them together. Or if you don't want coffee I brought you a soda. You should hurry, it's not getting any colder."  
"嘿，你真的那么累吗？我带了咖啡。还给你带了些零食，一起吃吧。或者如果你不想喝咖啡，我给你带了汽水。你得快点，它不会变得更凉的。"

He ignored her again. Asuka bit her lips and took the plunge.  
他又无视了她。明日香咬了咬嘴唇，决定豁出去。

"We need to talk." "我们需要谈谈。"

Talking wasn't _exactly_ what she planned to do, but she needed to get him sitting up with his eyes on her somehow. And it seemed to work. Shinji's shoulders twitched a little.  
说话并非她原本的打算，但她需要设法让他坐起来，目光集中在她身上。似乎奏效了。真嗣的肩膀微微颤动。

"About what?" "关于什么？"

Asuka swallowed hard. "Well, um. I actually want to pick up where we left off."  
明日香艰难地咽了咽口水。"嗯，呃。我其实是想从我们停下的地方继续。"

As she said that, Asuka placed her hand on Shinji's shoulder, running her thumb gently over it. She was sure that this gesture would remove all possible ambiguity in those words. She might as well have told him that she wanted to embrace him and kiss him, regardless of if the First was watching or not, and that she wanted to reconcile through her fingers in his hair and the feeling of his tongue on hers. Shinji would definitely respond to this, Asuka thought. No matter how angry he was, there was no way Shinji would turn down such an offer.  
说着，明日香将手放在真嗣的肩膀上，用拇指轻轻摩挲。她确信这个动作能消除那些话语中所有的可能歧义。她几乎是在告诉他，她想拥抱他，亲吻他，无论第一使徒是否在旁观看，她都希望通过指尖穿过他的发丝，以及他的舌尖触碰她的感觉来和解。明日香认为，真嗣一定会对此做出回应。无论他有多生气，真嗣绝不可能拒绝这样的提议。

That's why Shinji's reaction caught her off guard.  
这就是为什么真嗣的反应让她措手不及。

"Why, because Mr. Kaji's gone now?" he asked coldly, and pushed her away.  
“为什么，因为加持先生现在不在了？”他冷冷地问道，并推开了她。

He did not look at her.  
他没有看她。

Something hot rose in Asuka's throat. As she faced Shinji's back, as bleak and unyielding as a mountain's flank, something started to swirl in her chest. Asuka felt dizzy and lightheaded.  
一股热流在明日香喉间升起。面对着真嗣那如山脊般冷峻而坚定的背影，她的胸中开始翻涌起某种情绪。明日香感到一阵眩晕，头脑发轻。

_Look at me. Don't turn your back on me. Look at me. I offered you myself. You can't not look at me.  
看着我。别背对着我。看着我。我向你敞开了自己。你不能不看我。_

If the First didn't speak, Asuka wasn't sure what exactly she would have done. Something terrible. Something she would have regretted very much. She didn't have time to think about it. She didn't want to.  
如果初号机没有出声，明日香不确定自己究竟会做出什么。可能是些可怕的事。可能是些她会非常后悔的事。她没有时间去细想，也不愿去想。

"...What?" Asuka managed.  
"...什么？" 明日香勉强应道。

She turned her reddened face towards the First. She had heard the other girl's voice clearly, but she couldn't remember a single word of what she'd said. Her mind was a mess. The First had placed the book she was reading in her lap and was gazing at Asuka. There was a strange look on her face that Asuka couldn't describe.  
她将泛红的脸转向一旁的一号机驾驶员。虽然清楚地听到了对方的声音，但她却记不起任何一个字。她的思绪一片混乱。一号机驾驶员把正在阅读的书放在她的膝上，正凝视着明日香。她的脸上带着一种明日香无法形容的奇怪表情。

"I asked you if I made you angry, Second. Is that why you are fighting with Ikari?"  
"我问你，我是不是惹你生气了，二号机驾驶员。这就是你和碇吵架的原因吗？"

The world turned red. The next thing she knew she was in front of the First, her fists clenched. The First looked up at her calmly. The pale neck that stretched out of the collar of her white plugsuit caught Asuka's eye. She wondered what it would be like to squeeze it and watch the light fade from those creepy red eyes.  
世界变得一片猩红。下一刻，她发现自己站在第一使徒面前，双拳紧握。第一使徒平静地抬头看向她。那从白色紧身衣领口伸出的苍白脖颈吸引了明日香的目光。她不禁想象着掐住它，看着那双诡异的红眼失去光芒的情景。

"I'm sorry. But I really can't eat meat. If your intention was to eat the same thing as Ikari, I'll pass on the chips."  
“对不起。我真的不能吃肉。如果你是想和碇一起吃同样的东西，那我就不吃薯片了。”

Asuka was at a loss for words. She wanted to laugh, but nothing came out of her throat.  
明日香哑口无言。她想笑，但喉咙里却发不出任何声音。

Something moved out of the corner of her eye. She turned to find Shinji, somewhere between sitting up and lying down, watching her intently.  
她的眼角余光瞥见有什么东西在动。她转头一看，发现真嗣正介于坐起和躺下之间，专注地盯着她。

_Quick to come to her rescue, huh?_ Asuka gritted her teeth. But she couldn't really say he was overreacting.  
这么快就来救场了，嗯？明日香咬紧牙关。但她也不能说他反应过度。

In the end, she had succeeded in waking him up and making him look at her, but this time it was her turn to look away. The vicious satisfaction at having finally obtained his attention was tempered by withering shame. Not wanting to show him teary eyes, Asuka sat back in her seat and covered her face with both hands.  
最终，她成功地唤醒了他，让他看向自己，但这次轮到她移开视线了。终于获得他注意的恶毒满足感被凋零的羞耻所调和。不想让他看到泪眼，明日香坐回座位，双手掩面。

Even now, a shamefully large part of Asuka was hoping for Shinji to sigh and say her name, to come to her and soothe her with kind words and gentle caresses. All she could hear was a sad little squeaking noise as he lay down again.  
即便此刻，羞愧地讲，明日香心中仍有一大部分在期待着真嗣叹息着呼唤她的名字，来到她身边，用温柔的话语和轻柔的抚摸安抚她。然而，她所能听到的，只是他再次躺下时那微弱而悲伤的吱吱声。

This was going to be a long night.  
这将是一个漫长的夜晚。

---

Shinji opened his eyes, groaning. He could see the green ceiling tiles, which had espoused a cold metallic glow in the dim light.  
真嗣睁开眼睛，呻吟了一声。他能看到绿色的天花板瓷砖，在昏暗的灯光下泛着冰冷的金属光泽。

He must have fallen asleep for real while he was pretending. His whole body was throbbing. This was the first time he had slept in a plugsuit, and he never wanted to do it again. Every muscle and joint of his body felt stiff, and even though the room was cool thanks to the air conditioning, he felt sticky and disgusting all over.  
他肯定是在假装时真的睡着了。全身都在隐隐作痛。这是他第一次穿着插入栓服睡觉，再也不想有第二次了。每一块肌肉和关节都感到僵硬，尽管房间因空调而凉爽，他却觉得浑身黏腻恶心。

He lifted his creaky arm and flipped on the suit's built-in wristwatch, which read 04:37. He smiled wearily. Apparently, nothing had happened throughout the night, after all that fuss.  
他抬起嘎吱作响的手臂，按亮了内置在衣服里的腕表，显示时间为 04:37。他疲倦地笑了笑。显然，经过昨晚那番折腾，什么也没发生。

Shinji sat up, ignoring the protests from his back and legs. He rubbed his eyes, using the back of his hand, only to feel tears smearing all over his face. While angrily using both hands and even an arm to wipe away the annoying tears, something caught Shinji's eye.  
真嗣坐起身，无视背部和腿部的抗议。他用手背揉了揉眼睛，却感到泪水糊了满脸。在恼怒地用双手甚至一只手臂擦拭烦人的泪水时，有什么东西吸引了真嗣的注意。

Bags of snacks, an unopened canned coffee, and a can of Coke lay neatly on the table in front of him. Beyond those, on Asuka and Ayanami's sides, torn packages and empty cans were everywhere. Shinji had fallen asleep early, but his fellow pilots must have spent quite a bit of time trying to stay awake.  
几袋零食、一瓶未开封的罐装咖啡和一罐可乐整齐地摆在他面前的桌上。而在明日香和绫波那边，则是撕开的包装袋和空罐子散落一地。真嗣早早地睡着了，但他的两位同伴想必是花了很长时间试图保持清醒。

He checked the snacks again. The red, red can of Coke reminded him of a certain memory, making him smile.  
他又检查了一遍零食。那鲜红的可乐罐让他想起了某个记忆，不禁微笑起来。

Shinji looked up, wondering if they were both asleep now, and his heart sank. Ayanami was staring at him.  
真嗣抬头望去，想知道她们是否都已入睡，心中一沉。绫波正盯着他看。

Shinji squinted. Actually, Ayanami wasn't staring at him, she was sleeping while sitting, her face turned towards him. Her eyes were gently closed, and her normally cold and guarded face was more relaxed than he'd ever seen it. Her lips were slightly parted. A thin line of drool crept from one corner of her mouth and disappeared down her chin.  
真嗣眯起了眼睛。实际上，绫波并不是在盯着他，而是坐着睡着了，脸朝向他。她的眼睛轻轻闭合，平时冷漠而戒备的面容比他见过的任何时候都要放松。她的嘴唇微微张开，一丝口水从嘴角缓缓流出，顺着下巴滑落。

This was the first time he'd seen her asleep, and he couldn't help but smile at the look on her face. It somehow reminded him of the time she'd smiled at him in the melted plug. He wished he could see Ayanami like that more often, and he wished he could be the cause of it.  
这是他第一次看到她睡着的样子，他忍不住对着她的脸微笑。这让他想起了她在融化的插入栓中对他微笑的那一刻。他希望自己能更经常看到绫波这样，也希望自己能成为让她如此的原因。

At that last thought, he quickly shifted his attention to a certain girl who would cause massive havoc if she knew what he was thinking. Even if she couldn't read his mind, just looking at Ayanami while smiling was enough to get him into trouble. Shinji, even though he knew Asuka would probably be asleep, felt some amount of fear as he slowly shifted his gaze to the opposite couch, where he could see the red outline of her body.  
想到最后这一点，他迅速将注意力转移到某个女孩身上，如果她知道他在想什么，肯定会引起大麻烦。即使她无法读心，仅仅是看着绫波微笑就足以让他陷入困境。真嗣，尽管他知道明日香可能还在睡觉，但当他慢慢将目光移到对面的沙发上，看到她身体的红色轮廓时，还是感到了一丝恐惧。

Then Shinji's blood ran cold.  
随后，真嗣的血液仿佛凝固了。

The crimson thing on Asuka's couch was not anything resembling her slender body. It was...a red puddle. For a moment, Shinji doubted his eyes. Maybe this was a nightmare. Maybe the Angel somehow managed to attack while he was asleep, and it melted Asuka into the couch or something. Heart in his throat, Shinji scrambled to his feet and hobbled over to Asuka's couch.  
阿斯卡沙发上的那片猩红，绝非她纤细身躯的模样。那是一滩...红色的水洼。有那么一刻，真嗣怀疑自己的眼睛。或许这只是个噩梦。或许是某种天使在他熟睡时发动了攻击，将阿斯卡融化在沙发上之类的。心提到了嗓子眼，真嗣挣扎着站起身，一瘸一拐地走向阿斯卡的沙发。

Shinji must have made a noise, because Asuka groaned softly and rolled over onto her side. It was only then that Shinji realized that she had unpressurized her suit, let it sag around her, and then fallen asleep in it.  
真嗣一定是发出了声响，因为阿斯卡轻轻地呻吟了一声，翻了个身侧躺着。直到这时，真嗣才意识到她已经解除了战斗服的压力，让它松松垮垮地裹在身上，然后就这样睡着了。

Shinji sighed in relief. The two girls must be taking turns to surprise him like this, Shinji thought with mirth. Or he was just freaking out over nothing. Maybe he was still groggy after sleeping in an uncomfortable place and wearing uncomfortable clothes and thinking uncomfortable thoughts.  
真嗣松了口气。这两个女孩肯定是在轮流给他惊喜，真嗣带着一丝戏谑地想。或者他只是在无端恐慌。也许他还在因为睡在不舒适的地方、穿着不舒服的衣服、想着令人不安的想法而昏昏沉沉。

Shinji looked down at Asuka. Her face was obscured by her coppery hair, which was, like her suit, disheveled and fanned out around her. Shinji gently lifted the edge of Asuka's suit to make room for himself to sit, careful not to wake her up.  
真嗣低头看着明日香。她的脸被她那铜色的头发遮住了，头发和她身上的衣服一样凌乱，散开在她周围。真嗣轻轻地掀起明日香衣服的一角，为自己腾出坐下的空间，小心翼翼地不吵醒她。

He couldn't stop the couch from rocking slightly, though, which made Asuka moan. Shinji waited until he was sure she was still sleeping before carefully brushing Asuka's hair away from her face. Her mouth was slightly agape, and strands of hair stretched across her nostrils and mouth, quivering slightly from the force of her breath. Shinji wondered how the hell Asuka could even sleep like that. Wouldn't her hair make her sneeze?  
尽管如此，他还是无法阻止沙发轻微摇晃，这让明日香发出了呻吟。真嗣等到确定她还在睡后，才小心翼翼地将明日香的头发从她脸上拂开。她的嘴微微张开，几缕头发横跨在她的鼻孔和嘴巴上，随着她的呼吸微微颤动。真嗣不禁好奇明日香怎么能这样睡觉。她的头发不会让她打喷嚏吗？

But Asuka looked comfortable enough. Come to think of it, she had probably been in many situations where she had to stay in a plugsuit for an extended period of time, and as a result knew how to make herself as comfortable as possible under such conditions. Shinji, on the other hand, slept cluelessly in the tight, vacuum-sealed suit and got cramps all over his body. This must be one of the differences between an elite, trained veteran and a rookie.  
但明日香看起来倒是挺自在的。仔细想想，她可能经历过许多需要长时间穿着插入栓服的情况，因此知道如何在那种条件下尽可能让自己舒服。而真嗣则不同，他在那紧绷的真空密封服中无知地睡着，全身都抽筋了。这一定是精英训练有素的老手和新手之间的区别之一。

Shinji began to run his thumb and forefinger through her hair. Asuka's face was so tranquil, betraying nothing of the storm within her. She really was beautiful, Shinji found himself thinking. Her lips were full and pink. Her nose was straight and slightly upturned. The lines of her face were delicate and finely wrought. She looked like a refined lady from a painting, or a sculpture from days long past, remote and ultimately unattainable. And to top it all off, she was an elite pilot who had graduated from college at the age of fourteen. It made sense that she was so egotistical. It would be weird if she wasn't. Most of his ways of relating to her were founded on the bedrock of her ego.  
真嗣开始用拇指和食指梳理她的头发。明日香的脸庞如此宁静，丝毫没有透露出内心的风暴。她真的很美，真嗣不禁这样想。她的唇瓣丰满粉嫩，鼻梁挺直且微微上翘，面部的线条精致细腻。她宛如一幅画中的优雅女士，或是久远年代的雕塑，遥远而最终无法触及。更不用说，她还是一位十四岁就从大学毕业的精英驾驶员。她如此自负也就不难理解了。如果她不自负反而奇怪。他大多数与她相处的方式都是建立在她自负的基础之上。

Shinji remembered how he'd felt just before falling asleep. The seething anger and humiliation. Maybe he should just put such feelings aside and be grateful for the fact that a girl like Asuka liked him and allowed him to do…_things_ to her. Maybe, in exchange, he should just put up with the double standards, hypocrisies, and unfair demands. Their entire relationship wouldn't have started if Asuka hadn't reached out to him first. If she decided to leave him, it would probably hurt him more than it would hurt her. She had everything already. If she got bored or disgusted with him, she'd have no problem finding someone else, someone better. Shinji couldn't say the same.  
真嗣记得自己入睡前的感受，那股翻腾的愤怒与屈辱。或许他应该把这些情绪抛诸脑后，感激像明日香这样的女孩喜欢他，允许他做些……事情。或许，作为交换，他应该忍受那些双重标准、虚伪和不公平的要求。如果不是明日香先向他伸出手，他们的关系根本不会开始。如果她决定离开他，那对他造成的伤害可能比对她更大。她已经拥有了一切。如果她对他感到厌倦或厌恶，她可以毫不费力地找到其他人，更好的人。真嗣无法这么说。

But yesterday, Shinji couldn't accept Asuka's attempts at reconciliation. He knew he was being immature, but he couldn't help it.  
但昨天，真嗣无法接受明日香的和解尝试。他知道自己很幼稚，但他控制不住。

He couldn't stand how Asuka looked at Kaji. The tone of voice in which she talked to him. She didn't look at him like that. She didn't talk to him like that. It was unacceptable. He grimaced as he remembered Asuka's words to him several hours earlier about Ayanami. She'd said the same thing. It was wrong on so many levels, Shinji realized. He couldn't quite put his finger on the how, but it resonated instinctively with him.  
他无法忍受明日香看加持的眼神，以及她对他说话的语气。她从未那样看过他，从未那样对他说过话。这让他无法接受。他皱起眉头，回想起几个小时前明日香对绫波零的评价，她用的也是同样的言辞。在很多层面上，这都是错误的，真嗣意识到了。他虽然无法确切指出原因，但这种感觉本能地在他心中回响。

But didn't thinking so make him a hypocrite? No better than Asuka getting irrationally angry at Ayanami? The thought plunged him into self-loathing. His hand stopped running through her hair.  
但这样想不就让他成了伪君子吗？不比明日香无理取闹地对绫波零发火好到哪儿去？这个念头让他陷入了自我厌恶。他的手停止了在她头发中的抚摸。

Then again, he wasn't the one openly chasing after someone else with hearts in his eyes.  
话说回来，他也不是那个公开用满眼爱意追逐别人的人。

At the end of the day, though, he had no intention of arguing with her about it. Asuka wanted him. Nothing else mattered. They would find a way to solve any problems that came up, together.  
尽管如此，到了最后，他并不打算和她争论这件事。明日香想要他。其他什么都不重要。他们会一起找到解决任何问题的方法。

_But if you're going to ask something like that of me, you should at least return the favor. I gave you that stupid letter. I have every right to ask the same of you.  
但如果你要我做这样的事，至少你也应该回报我。我给了你那封愚蠢的信。我有权向你提出同样的要求。_

It had been easy to shrug off when he'd thought that he and Asuka were nothing, that he had no chance, that she was out of his league. That was no longer possible. The fact that Asuka, _his_ Asuka, had reacted like that to another man had ripped a hole in his thoughts. The part of him that had been desperately trying to defend her could no longer do so.  
当他以为自己和明日香毫无关系，以为自己毫无机会，以为她遥不可及时，这一切都很容易被他抛诸脑后。但现在这已不可能。明日香，他的明日香，对另一个男人有那样的反应，这在他的思绪中撕开了一个裂口。那个曾经拼命试图保护她的他，再也无法这样做了。

But what should he do about it? He didn't know. As with most things that involved Asuka. Especially on things like this. He couldn't look to Asuka for clues; it was entirely his problem. At least now he knew that nothing would be solved if he acted like he did yesterday.  
但他应该怎么做呢？他不知道。就像大多数涉及明日香的事情一样。尤其是在这种情况下。他不能指望明日香提供线索；这完全是他的问题。至少现在他明白，如果他像昨天那样行事，问题是不会得到解决的。

So then, how? 那么，该怎么办？

Shinji remembered what Asuka had said before Kaji came. An offer he had at first refused, then conceded to postpone. Looking at the outline of her body beneath her puffy suit, her breasts rising and falling, he realized what he wanted to do right now. What he wanted to do yesterday, what he wanted to do the day before, what he wanted to do the night she lay down next to him, what he wanted to do the moment he set his eyes upon the girl on the _Over The Rainbow_. He was just not sure if that was the right thing to want, or if he could ever be honest about such a desire.  
真嗣想起了明日香在加持到来之前说的话。他起初拒绝了一个提议，后来同意推迟。看着她蓬松的套装下身体的轮廓，她的胸部起伏着，他意识到他现在想做什么。昨天他想做什么，前一天他想做什么，她躺在他身边的那晚他想做什么，他在彩虹之上看到那个女孩的那一刻他想做什么。他只是不确定这是否是他应该想要的，或者他是否能对这样的欲望坦诚相待。

Before he knew it, Shinji's hand was cupping Asuka's cheek. Her eyes fluttered slightly, then opened.  
不知不觉间，真嗣的手已经抚上了明日香的脸颊。她的眼睑微微颤动，随即睁开了眼睛。

"Shinji...?" “真嗣……？”

Asuka's lips parted slightly, then her eyes widened. She propped her elbows on the couch and began to push herself up. "Angel's here?"  
明日香的双唇微微张开，接着她的眼睛瞪大了。她用肘部撑着沙发，开始起身。“天使来了？”

_Is that the first thing you think after waking up?_ But then again, that was the most natural reaction for an Evangelion pilot who was preparing for battle. It was him that was wrong, as always. His mind was more occupied with Asuka than anything else.  
醒来后的第一反应就是这个吗？但话说回来，对于一个准备战斗的福音战士驾驶员来说，这是最自然的反应。错的是他，一如既往。他的心思更多地放在了明日香身上，而非其他任何事。

His girlfriend. Impossibly beautiful. An elite pilot. The best at everything.  
他的女朋友。美得不可思议。精英驾驶员。样样精通。

Shinji ran his thumb under Asuka's eye. He felt her body tremble slightly.  
真嗣用拇指轻轻划过明日香的眼角。他感觉到她的身体微微颤抖。

How much space did he occupy in her mind, he wondered. And how could he make that space larger, so she would never blush again for that old man who stank of cigarettes?  
他在她心中占据了多少空间，他不禁思索。又该如何扩大那片空间，让她再也不会为那个满身烟臭的老头脸红呢？

He thought he knew how.  
他想他知道该怎么做。

Asuka glanced sideways, in Ayanami's direction. "The First is there."  
明日香侧目望向绫波的方向。"一号机在那里。"

The fact that Asuka, with just one look at him, had instantly recognized his intentions, the same intentions Shinji himself had just solidified, was more arousing than anything else and strengthened Shinji's resolve. He leaned in, squeezing her cheek to hold her there, and kissed her. He didn't close his eyes, so he had a full view of Asuka's pupils dilating in surprise. For a moment, Asuka stared at Shinji without moving. Shinji didn't pull away and returned her gaze, shifting his body so that he was completely on top of her. Asuka pulled her head back, gasping.  
事实是，仅凭一眼，明日香就立刻识破了他的意图，这与他刚刚坚定的心意如出一辙，比任何事物都更令人兴奋，也坚定了真嗣的决心。他倾身向前，捏住她的脸颊让她无法动弹，然后吻了她。他没有闭上眼睛，因此清楚地看到明日香因惊讶而瞳孔放大。有那么一刻，明日香凝视着真嗣，一动不动。真嗣没有退缩，回望着她，调整身体让自己完全压在她身上。明日香向后仰头，喘息着。

"What if the Angel comes?"  
“万一使徒来了怎么办？”

"You were the one who said it didn't matter. That Ayanami didn't matter. That if there was an alarm they would call us."  
“是你说的，那不重要。绫波不重要。如果有警报，他们会叫我们的。”

Asuka groaned, turning her head to the side. "Can I brush my teeth then? And -"  
明日香呻吟着，将头转向一边。“那我可以刷牙吗？还有——”

Seeing no reason to listen any longer, Shinji closed her mouth with his once again. He caught her mid sentence, and slipped his tongue between her parted lips. Her eyes slid shut in the face of his onslaught, and a small, stifled moan escaped her. Her hands came up and tried to push him away. In response, Shinji pushed Asuka's right arm down with his knee, and he grabbed her left hand by the wrist and pinned it over her head.  
觉得没有再听下去的必要，真嗣再次用嘴堵住了她的唇。他打断了她的话，舌头滑入她微张的唇间。面对他的猛攻，她的眼睛闭上了，一声压抑的呻吟从她喉间逸出。她的双手试图推开他。作为回应，真嗣用膝盖压住她的右臂，同时抓住她的左手腕，将其按在她的头顶上。

Amidst the struggle, Shinji's finger pressed a button on her wrist, activating the compression mechanism of her suit. A sharp hissing sound filled the room. Hot air mixed with a heady, pungent smell surrounded them, and it took Shinji a moment to realize that it was Asuka's scent that came right out of her suit. Her body stiffened and her tongue, which was moving rather enthusiastically until a moment ago, had gone still. Perhaps she was mortified, but Shinji didn't care. Not a bit.  
在挣扎中，真嗣按下了她手腕上的一个按钮，激活了她的战斗服压缩机制。房间里充满了尖锐的嘶嘶声。热气混合着一种浓烈而刺鼻的气味包围了他们，真嗣过了一会儿才意识到那是从明日香的战斗服中散发出的她的体香。她的身体僵硬了，原本活跃的舌头也静止了下来。也许她感到羞愧，但真嗣毫不在意。一点儿也不。

_I'm the only one who gets to be this close to you. Who gets to smell this from you.  
我是唯一一个能这么靠近你的人。唯一能闻到你这种味道的人。_

The thought excited him so much to the point he instantly felt lightheaded. And maybe the smell itself wasn't bad after all. No, the scent only seemed to add to his excitement. This was the single most disgusting and hilarious thing that had ever happened between them, but it didn't feel that way to Shinji at all. He was no longer able to control himself. He pushed Asuka further down into the couch and tilted his head, shoving his tongue into her mouth, licking the roof of it, her tongue, her teeth.  
这个念头让他兴奋到几乎感到头晕目眩。或许那气味本身并不糟糕。不，这香味似乎只增加了他的兴奋感。这是他们之间发生过的最恶心又最滑稽的事情，但对真嗣来说，完全不是那样。他再也无法控制自己。他将明日香更深地压进沙发，倾斜头部，将舌头伸进她的嘴里，舔舐着她的上颚、舌头和牙齿。

"Ah," Asuka gasped, when he pulled away to draw breath. She squirmed in his grip, pushing herself up. She brought her left hand to her chest and rubbed her wrist, frowning a bit. "It hurts."  
“啊，”明日香在他抽身呼吸时喘息道。她在他的掌控下扭动，试图起身。她将左手放在胸前，揉着手腕，微微皱眉。“好痛。”

Shinji ignored Asuka's words again and pushed down her shoulders, forcing her to lie down again. She acquiesced without resistance this time, her eyes sliding shut, but Shinji didn't move, just stared down at her. Then he turned his body halfway to look at her feet.  
真嗣再次无视了明日香的话，按下她的肩膀，强迫她再次躺下。这次她没有反抗，顺从地闭上了眼睛，但真嗣没有动，只是低头凝视着她。然后他半转身子，看向她的脚。

_Yes. From head to toe. To be precise, toe to head._ With a strangely sinking, almost grim feeling, Shinji resolved to do just that. He reached for Asuka's feet.  
是的，从头到脚。准确地说，是从脚到头。带着一种奇怪的沉重，几乎是阴郁的感觉，真嗣下定决心要这么做。他伸手去触碰明日香的脚。

"What are you doing?" Asuka whispered. Shinji ignored her questioning gaze and turned his head fully to Asuka's feet.  
“你在做什么？”明日香低声问道。真嗣无视她询问的目光，完全转向了明日香的脚。

_I'm going to reclaim you. I'll take all of you._ He couldn't bring himself to say those words. Just the mere thought of them made him feel terrible, disgusting. But it was too late to turn back.  
我要重新拥有你。我要拥有你的全部。他无法将这些话说出口。仅仅是想到这些话，就让他感到无比糟糕，令人作呕。但现在已经无法回头了。

When Shinji squeezed Asuka's foot, she let out a small giggle. "What are you doing? I asked you."  
当真嗣捏住明日香的脚时，她发出了一声轻笑。“你在干什么？我问你呢。”

Well, it was perplexing for Shinji, too. His idea was to touch her everywhere, but once he started with her foot in his hand he wasn't sure what to do with it. It was different from grabbing her arm or pulling her by the waist in the middle of a kiss. Those were thoughtless, heat-of-the-moment things, while this was more deliberate.  
嗯，这对真嗣来说也很困惑。他的想法是触碰她的每一处，但一旦他开始握住她的脚，就不确定该如何继续了。这与抓住她的手臂或在亲吻中搂住她的腰不同。那些是无意识的、激情时刻的行为，而这次则更为刻意。

Feeling the stiff, hardened plastic of the plugsuit sole in his hand, Shinji turned his head to check Asuka's face. Bewilderment and anticipation looked back at him. He turned away and ran his thumb along the top of her foot. It wasn't too different from what he'd done to Asuka's face or back a few times.  
手中感受着插入栓服鞋底那僵硬而坚硬的塑料质感，真嗣转头查看明日香的脸。困惑与期待交织的神情映入眼帘。他转过身，用拇指沿着她的脚背轻轻滑过。这与他对明日香的脸或背部所做的几次并无太大差别。

Would it feel good to her? Shinji wondered. He was, at most, tickling her foot through the plugsuit. Perhaps it was more of an emotional thing than anything else, like Shinji himself was feeling. With that in mind, Shinji slowly moved his hand toward her ankle. The bone jutted out, blocking his fingers like a speed bump. Shinji swept his hand up over it, almost squeezing Asuka's ankle. It was so slender that it almost fit within his grasp.  
这对她来说会感觉好吗？真嗣暗自思忖。他最多只是在插入栓服外轻挠她的脚。或许这更多的是一种情感上的体验，就像真嗣自己所感受到的那样。想到这里，真嗣缓缓将手移向她的脚踝。那突出的骨头像减速带一样阻挡着他的手指。真嗣的手轻轻掠过，几乎是在轻捏明日香的脚踝。它是如此纤细，几乎完全被他的手掌握住。

Shinji's hand lingered on her ankle for a moment, then moved up to the calf. He felt every inch of lean muscle beneath the tight rubber of the plugsuit. It was a strange feeling, different from hugging in the middle of a kiss. Shinji was used to losing track of time in the hot madness of excitement. This was exciting, too, but everything was slower and more focused, clear and intentional. Under the quiet crackle of the fluorescent lights, Asuka's unsteady breathing, and the drum of his own heartbeat, Shinji slowly ran his hands higher and higher up her body. He traced the contours of her calf. The tiny bones and tendons in the soft indentation on the backside of her knee. His fingers curved to their tips, pressing and sliding as if they were moving over cello strings. It was an unconscious thing, muscle memory coming out.  
碇真嗣的手在她脚踝上停留了片刻，随后缓缓上移至小腿。他感受着紧身驾驶服下每一寸紧致的肌肉。这种感觉颇为奇异，与亲吻中拥抱的激情截然不同。真嗣习惯了在狂热的激情中忘却时间，而此刻虽同样令人兴奋，却一切都慢了下来，更加专注，清晰而有意。在荧光灯微弱的噼啪声中，明日香不稳的呼吸声与他自己心跳的鼓动交织，真嗣缓缓将手向上游走，抚过她的小腿轮廓，轻触她膝盖后方柔软的骨节与肌腱。他的指尖弯曲，按压滑动，仿佛在拨弄着大提琴的弦，这一切动作几乎是无意识的，肌肉记忆自然而然地流露。

Shinji's thumb grazed just above Asuka's knee, and Asuka let out a small sigh. At that, Shinji momentarily lost his confidence and wondered if he was doing something wrong, if this whole thing was ridiculous and Asuka was in fact bored to tears. When he turned around, Asuka's eyes were closed, giving him no clues to help him decide. Then Shinji frowned. This was not about her. Not now. He was going to leave his mark on her, whether she liked it or not.  
真嗣的拇指轻轻拂过明日香膝盖上方，明日香发出一声微弱的叹息。这一声让真嗣瞬间失去了自信，怀疑自己是否做错了什么，整个事情是否荒谬至极，而明日香其实已经无聊到极点。当他转过头时，明日香的双眼紧闭，没有给他任何线索来帮助他做出决定。随后，真嗣皱起了眉头。这不是关于她的事。至少现在不是。他打算在她身上留下自己的印记，无论她是否喜欢。

Such a thought sent a pang of guilt through his heart, though. He reached out with his left hand that had been sitting limply at his side and found hers. Asuka intertwined her fingers with his. She didn't open her eyes.  
这样的想法让他的心中涌起一阵愧疚。他用一直无力地垂在身侧的左手伸出去，找到了她的手。明日香将手指与他的交缠在一起。她没有睁开眼睛。

Taking that as permission, Shinji swallowed hard and resumed his progress. When he finally reached her thigh, hesitation once again gripped his hand, but Shinji pushed through it, his mind strangely calm. He stroked along the diagonal black lines on top of her thigh with his thumb.  
真嗣将此视为许可，艰难地咽了口唾沫，继续他的动作。当他最终触及她的大腿时，犹豫再次攫住了他的手，但真嗣克服了它，内心出奇地平静。他用拇指沿着她大腿上斜向的黑线轻轻抚摸。

Asuka's body shuddered slightly and a small whimper escaped her mouth as Shinji ran his fingers up her inner thighs.  
明日香的身躯微微颤抖，一声细小的呜咽从她口中逸出，当真嗣的手指沿着她的大腿内侧向上滑动时。

_It really is like a cello_, Shinji thought. Except that instead of low, even tones, this instrument was making high, stifled squeaks and twitching beneath his touch. Shinji took a deep breath. He thought about leaning down and tracing her leg with his mouth. His suit had never felt so tight.  
这真的像一把大提琴，真嗣心想。只不过，代替低沉均匀的音调，这件乐器发出了高亢、压抑的吱吱声，并在他的触摸下抽搐。真嗣深吸了一口气。他想俯下身，用嘴唇沿着她的腿描绘。他的西装从未感觉如此紧绷。

Of course, even with all the bold thoughts, Shinji dared not move his hand between Asuka's legs. He stopped at the very tops of her thighs, in the crease between them and the rest of her torso, a dangerous enough place. Asuka's grip on Shinji's hand tightened. She was looking up at Shinji, her eyes opened now. Her face was flushed.  
当然，尽管脑海中充满了大胆的想法，真嗣却不敢将手移到明日香的双腿之间。他停在她大腿的最顶端，那条褶皱处，介于大腿与躯干之间，一个足够危险的位置。明日香握紧了真嗣的手。她抬头看着真嗣，眼睛已经睁开。她的脸颊泛红。

_What do you want?_ Shinji wanted to ask. _What are you getting out of this? Does this really feel good to you? If so, why? How? Do you have something else you want me to do?_  
你想要什么？真嗣想问。你从中得到了什么？这真的让你感觉好吗？如果是的话，为什么？怎样做到的？你还有其他想让我做的事吗？

For Shinji, he liked this for some reason. The sensation of claiming Asuka touch by touch, piece by piece, was so unbearably good that he felt like he was going to burst down there. The thought that there was something very wrong about that had been quashed to almost nothing, overwhelmed by excitement.  
对真嗣来说，不知为何他喜欢这样。一点一滴、一寸一寸地占有明日香的感觉，好得让他觉得那里快要爆发了。虽然他觉得这有些不对劲，但这种想法几乎被兴奋感淹没，变得微不足道。

Then he recalled what Asuka said. That he should do what he wanted. That she gave him permanent consent.  
然后他想起了明日香说过的话。他应该做他想做的事。她给了他永久的同意。

Looking straight into her eyes, Shinji ran his fingers up across her hip bones. Asuka closed her eyes. A moan, tightly suppressed, managed to escape her mouth. Shinji's fingers slid up Asuka's side, which made her stomach sink in and her back arch at the same time.  
直视着她的眼睛，真嗣用手指沿着她的髋骨向上滑去。明日香闭上了眼睛。一声压抑的呻吟，勉强从她口中逸出。真嗣的手指滑过明日香的侧身，这让她的小腹不由自主地收紧，同时背部也弓了起来。

Soon Shinji's thumb reached her ribs, protruding under the thin suit. He grazed them, passing over each one like he was climbing a hill, and she flinched and gasped every time as if she'd been electrocuted.  
很快，真嗣的拇指触到了她突出的肋骨，那薄薄的紧身衣下清晰可见。他轻轻掠过每一根肋骨，仿佛在攀登山峰，而她每次都像被电击一般颤抖着喘息。

When Shinji's nails scraped against the hard orange cup, Asuka opened her eyes again. With an uncharacteristic anxiety in her eyes, she opened her mouth.  
当真嗣的指甲刮过坚硬的橙色护杯时，明日香再次睁开了眼睛。她的眼中流露出不寻常的焦虑，她张开了嘴。

"Let's do the rest later."  
“剩下的待会儿再做吧。”

_What do you mean by later?_ Shinji almost asked. _This whole thing started because of you._  
“后来是什么意思？” 真嗣几乎要问出口。这一切都是因她而起的。

But maybe, maybe she was testing him again. That sounded like her.  
但或许，或许她又在考验他了。听起来很像她的风格。

Then another thought followed. No, more of a realization. That it all didn't matter. That none of it mattered. Shinji wanted it and that was the end of it.  
随即，另一个念头接踵而至。不，更确切地说是一种领悟。一切都不重要了。没有任何一件事是重要的。真嗣想要，那就是结局

Asuka's eyes widened. Shinji let go of her hand and then ran his hand over her wrist, her elbow, her armpit, her shoulder, and then her ear in quick succession. While trying to grab her hair, his fingers poked her head, hard, but his mind failed to even recognize it. Her hair was warm and sticky with sweat. He stroked it, then ran his hand down to her brow, his thumb brushing her eyebrow, the bridge of her nose, her eyelid, before finally coming to rest firmly on her cheek.  
明日香的眼睛睁大了。真嗣松开了她的手，然后迅速地用手抚过她的手腕、肘部、腋下、肩膀，最后是她的耳朵。在试图抓住她的头发时，他的手指重重地戳到了她的头，但他的意识甚至没有察觉到这一点。她的头发因汗水而温暖且黏腻。他轻抚着，然后手滑至她的眉间，拇指掠过她的眉毛、鼻梁、眼睑，最终稳稳地停留在她的脸颊上。

All the while Asuka was silent, her eyes fixed on his. His right hand was frozen at the cusp of her breast, still hesitating. Then he finally mustered up enough courage to cross the last line. His hand settled heavily over her breast and then squeezed, hard. The plastic cup squeaked. Asuka gasped.  
与此同时，明日香一直沉默着，目光紧锁在他身上。他的右手停留在她胸部的边缘，依然犹豫不决。最终，他鼓起勇气跨越了最后的界限。他的手重重地覆盖在她的胸部上，然后用力一握。塑料杯发出了吱吱声。明日香倒吸了一口气。

It was different from Ayanami's. What was in Shinji's hand now was not soft flesh, but a hard orange cup and the synthetic rubber attached to it. He still could feel that there was something inside, but nonetheless it was rather more disappointing than he had imagined.  
这与绫波的不同。真嗣手中现在握着的并非柔软的肌肤，而是一个坚硬的橙色杯子及其附着的合成橡胶。他仍能感觉到里面有东西，但无论如何，这比他想象的要令人失望得多。

Asuka started to prop up her body. "I said, let's do it later."  
明日香开始支撑起自己的身体。“我说了，晚点再做。”

Her words didn't register with him. What caught his attention now was a half-dried line of drool on one side of Asuka's lips. Shinji leaned down, suddenly obsessed with it. Their bodies pressed together, and the angle made his hand naturally cup Asuka's breast. She moaned, looking up at him with liquid eyes, and then cringed and recoiled when Shinji stuck out his tongue and ran it up her jawline to her mouth, licking up the drool there. Asuka tried to pull back, this time quite seriously, but Shinji's hands and knees pinned her down. It was a futile effort. She was cornered, her back pressed against the armrest of the sofa. There was no escape.  
她的话他没听进去。此刻吸引他注意力的是明日香唇边半干的口水痕迹。真嗣俯下身，突然对此着迷。他们的身体紧贴在一起，这个角度使他的手自然地握住了明日香的乳房。她呻吟着，用湿润的眼睛抬头看他，随后在真嗣伸出舌头，沿着她的下颌线舔到嘴边，舔去那里的口水时，她皱眉并退缩了。明日香试图后退，这次是认真的，但真嗣的手和膝盖将她牢牢按住。她的努力徒劳无功。她被逼到了绝境，背部紧贴着沙发的扶手，无处可逃。

Readjusting himself, Shinji cupped her breast again and pressed his entire body against hers. He was careful to lift his waist slightly and leave some room in the hip area. Shinji had always remembered the lesson of their first kiss.  
调整了一下姿势，真嗣再次用手掌托住她的乳房，并将整个身体紧贴在她身上。他小心翼翼地微微抬起腰，在臀部留出一些空间。真嗣始终记得他们第一次接吻时的教训。

Asuka watched him with an odd look on her face as he pressed himself against her. There was no more resistance. She frowned slightly, then spread her legs and wrapped them around Shinji's hips. This time, Shinji allowed her. Their crotches brushed lightly against one another. Shinji took a deep breath.  
明日香看着他紧贴着自己，脸上带着一种奇怪的表情。她不再抗拒。明日香微微皱眉，然后张开双腿，环绕在真嗣的臀部。这一次，真嗣没有拒绝。他们的下体轻轻地摩擦着彼此。真嗣深吸了一口气。

Asuka gave a small snort and closed her eyes. "Whatever you do, don't stop."  
明日香轻哼一声，闭上了眼睛。"无论你做什么，都不要停下来。"

_Do what?_ Shinji wanted to ask, because he wasn't sure anymore. He had already accomplished what he set out to do, and while it felt good, he was at a loss for what to do next. But before he could ask, Asuka wrapped a hand around his neck and pulled him closer, while putting the other on his back. Glaring at him, Asuka sucked in Shinji's upper lip. He didn't pull away. Instead, he returned her gaze and kissed her back. Neither looked away. Their spit smelled sour. The kiss was wet.  
做什么？真嗣想问，因为他不再确定了。他已经完成了他打算做的事情，虽然感觉很好，但他不知道接下来该做什么。但还没等他问出口，明日香一手环住他的脖子，将他拉近，另一只手放在他的背上。她瞪着他，吸住了真嗣的上唇。他没有退缩。相反，他回望着她，吻了回去。两人都没有移开视线。他们的唾液带着酸味。这个吻很湿润。

Shinji realized that even though most of her breast was covered by the cup, there was quite a bit that he could stroke if he stretched his thumb upward enough. He shivered at the softness of the flesh he felt beneath his finger. He was teasing her mouth with his tongue, almost entering it but not quite, when her lower body jerked suddenly. It shocked him so much that he pulled away reflexively, but Asuka's hand on his neck pulled him back roughly before he could go too far.  
真嗣意识到，尽管大部分胸部被胸罩覆盖，但如果他足够向上伸展拇指，还是有很多地方可以抚摸的。他因指尖下感受到的柔软肌肤而颤抖。他用舌头逗弄着她的嘴唇，几乎要进入却又未完全进入，这时她的下半身突然一抖。这让他如此震惊，以至于他本能地退缩，但明日香放在他脖子上的手粗暴地将他拉了回来，不让他退得太远。

"What did I tell you?"  
“我告诉过你什么？”

"To not stop," he breathed, and leaned in again. Asuka, perhaps in revenge, bit Shinji's bottom lip with her front teeth and pulled her head back hard. Shinji was dragged down with a yelp. In retaliation, Shinji dug his fingers into the edge of the cup where the plastic and the rubber met and pulled it down hard. Normally, a properly worn plugsuit would never move under that kind of force, but hers was not properly compressed. As a result, Shinji felt a slight movement in his hand. Something hard scraped against his knuckles. Asuka let out a low moan and opened her mouth. Shinji descended swiftly, adjusting his position before covering it with his own. Now there was a foul, coppery scent of blood mixed with that of their saliva. He tasted iron.  
"不停止，"他低语着，再次倾身靠近。明日香或许是出于报复，用门牙轻咬住真嗣的下唇，猛地向后一扯。真嗣痛呼一声，被拽了下来。作为回击，真嗣手指扣住插座边缘，那里塑料与橡胶相接之处，用力向下拉扯。通常情况下，穿戴得当的插入栓服绝不会在这种力道下移动，但她的并未被完全压缩。因此，真嗣感到手中传来一丝微动，有什么坚硬的东西擦过他的指节。明日香发出一声低吟，张开了嘴。真嗣迅速俯身，调整姿势后覆盖上去。此刻，一股腥臭的铜锈味混杂着两人的唾液气息弥漫开来。他尝到了铁的味道。

Asuka's back arched, her lower body rubbing against Shinji's thigh, and only then did Shinji realize that she was doing this on purpose. To what end, he had no idea, but he couldn't afford to care about that now. Asuka was everywhere: on his lips, on his fingers, all over his body. His world boiled down to her scent, the heat of her body against his, her rapid breathing and high breathy moans that tickled his ears. He felt like he was going to orgasm at any moment now. It was all he could do to keep Asuka from slamming her groin against his. Even the haphazard, accidental points of contact sent shuddering lightning bolts of pleasure arcing through him. Shinji curled his toes and squeezed his eyes shut.  
明日香的背部弓起，她的下半身摩擦着真嗣的大腿，直到这时真嗣才意识到她是故意的。出于什么目的，他毫无头绪，但此刻他无暇顾及这些。明日香无处不在：在他的唇上，在他的指尖，遍布他的全身。他的世界浓缩成她的香气，她身体的热度，她急促的呼吸和高亢的呻吟撩拨着他的耳膜。他感觉自己随时都可能达到高潮。他竭尽全力阻止明日香猛烈地撞击他的胯部。即便是那些随意、意外的接触，也如电击般带来阵阵快感。真嗣蜷缩着脚趾，紧闭双眼。

Her movements down there became faster and more spasmodic. _What the hell is she doing?_ he wondered. Then Asuka removed her mouth from his, gasped sharply, and pulled him hard to her. Their crotches made contact. He sucked in a sharp breath and his head swam at the sudden warmth.  
她那里的动作变得更加快速和痉挛。她到底在做什么？他疑惑着。随后明日香从他嘴边移开，猛地吸了口气，将他紧紧拉向自己。他们的胯部相触。他倒吸一口凉气，突如其来的温暖让他头晕目眩。

"Shinji-Shinji!" Asuka gasped. Shinji bit his lip so hard it bled again.  
“真嗣-真嗣！”明日香喘息着。真嗣用力咬住嘴唇，以至于再次流血。

Asuka's hot breath tickled his ear, paralyzing him. Her body bounced a few times against his, as Shinji remained frozen both by the incomprehensible situation and the fact that he almost ruined his suit.  
明日香炽热的呼吸轻拂过他的耳畔，令他动弹不得。她的身体在他身上弹跳了几下，而真嗣依旧僵硬地呆立着，既因这难以理解的情境，也因他差点毁了自己的西装。

"Asuka...?" “明日香...？”

Shinji let go of Asuka. She sagged, resting her head on the armrest of the couch and covering her face with her hands. Her chest rose and fell as she breathed heavily. It belatedly occurred to Shinji that his weight on top of her couldn't possibly make her breathing easier, so he quickly slid off her and squatted on the floor next to the couch. Asuka lay still, her face covered, unmoving.  
真嗣放开了明日香。她瘫软下来，将头靠在沙发扶手上，双手掩面。她的胸膛随着沉重的呼吸起伏。真嗣这才后知后觉地意识到，自己压在她身上不可能让她呼吸顺畅，于是他迅速滑下，蹲在沙发旁的地板上。明日香静静地躺着，脸被遮住，一动不动。

Shinji didn't know what had happened, or what he had done to Asuka. The burning madness of his desire had been replaced by a hollow emptiness in his chest. He wondered if he truly had gone mad. Driven mad with jealousy and lust. But... what in the hell happened to her? Did he hurt her? Did he…break her, somehow?  
真嗣不知道发生了什么，也不知道自己对明日香做了什么。他心中燃烧的疯狂欲望已被空虚所取代。他怀疑自己是否真的疯了。被嫉妒和欲望驱使而疯狂。但是……她到底怎么了？他伤害了她吗？他……以某种方式打破了她吗？

Asuka started to whimper, causing Shinji's heart to pound like crazy. He had to find a way to fix this somehow…  
明日香开始呜咽，这让真嗣的心脏狂跳不已。他必须设法以某种方式解决这个问题……

"Oh, we did it," Asuka gasped. "We actually did it. I mean, technically not, not really, but sorta. I can't believe it. What am I supposed to do now? Pervert."  
“哦，我们做到了，”明日香喘息着说，“我们真的做到了。我是说，技术上不算，不是真的，但有点儿。我简直不敢相信。我现在该怎么办？变态。”

It took Shinji a few moments to decipher what she said. Her voice shook. At first, Shinji thought she was sobbing, and his blood ran cold. But then Asuka wriggled her whole body, and Shinji realized that she was…laughing.  
真嗣花了片刻才理解她的话。她的声音颤抖着。起初，真嗣以为她在哭泣，他的血液都凝固了。但随后明日香扭动全身，真嗣意识到她在……笑。

"Asuka?" Shinji whispered, leaning over to her. "Did I...what did I do to you, Asuka?"  
“明日香？” 真嗣低声唤道，俯身向她。“我……我对你做了什么，明日香？”

Asuka's sigh whistled through her hands like wind through a cave. Then Asuka giggled and took her hands off her face. "Oh my God, it stinks. I told you we needed to brush our teeth first."  
明日香的叹息如风穿洞穴般从双手间呼啸而过。随即，明日香咯咯笑了起来，将手从脸上移开。“哦，天哪，真臭。我早说过我们得先刷牙。”

Shinji swallowed through his dry mouth and waited for Asuka's answer. Instead of answering his question, she lay sideways, propping an elbow on the armrest and resting her chin on one hand, looking at him. A smile lit up her crimson face, then disappeared, replaced by a blank expression.  
真嗣咽了咽干涩的喉咙，等待着明日香的回答。她没有直接回应他的问题，而是侧身躺下，用一只胳膊肘撑在扶手上，下巴抵在掌心，凝视着他。她的脸颊因羞涩而泛红，笑容一闪而过，随即被一片空白所取代。

"Uh, Shinji." "呃，真嗣。"

Shinji's heart, which had somewhat calmed down, began to race again. "Yeah?"  
真嗣的心，原本已经稍微平静下来，又开始加速跳动。“嗯？”

"Where's the First?" “初号机在哪儿？”

Shinji turned around quickly. Ayanami, who had been sleeping on one of the couches, was nowhere to be seen, and the implications of that made his heart freeze. Shinji let out a pitiful groan.  
真嗣迅速转身。绫波原本躺在其中一张沙发上睡觉，此刻却不见踪影，这背后的含义让他的心瞬间冻结。真嗣发出了一声可怜的呻吟。

Asuka sighed, and Shinji looked back at her. Shinji had never been more confused in his life.  
明日香叹了口气，真嗣回头看向她。真嗣这辈子从未如此困惑过。

"Asuka, you haven't answered my question yet."  
“明日香，你还没回答我的问题呢。”

"What question?" "什么问题？"

"What did I do to you? What happened to you?"  
"我对你做了什么？你发生了什么事？"

Asuka giggled in disbelief. "Now you're pushing your luck. You really think you could make me say that? I'm in a good mood, yeah, but don't you dare."  
明日香难以置信地咯咯笑了起来。“现在你真是得寸进尺了。你真以为你能让我说出那种话？我心情是不错，但别太过分了。”

Shinji felt like his chest was going to burst with frustration. Asuka, probably unaware of this, gave him a mischievous grin.  
真嗣感到胸口因沮丧快要炸裂。明日香大概对此浑然不觉，朝他露出了一个调皮的笑容。

"You're not done yet, are you?"  
“你还没完事呢，对吧？”

"Done with what?" Shinji asked reflexively, then followed Asuka's gaze with his own. Shinji blushed and shrank back. "Oh, that, no..."  
“完什么事？”真嗣下意识地问道，随后顺着明日香的目光看去。真嗣脸红了，往后缩了缩。“哦，那个啊，没有……”

The look she was giving was strange. It wasn't until Shinji began to feel like hiding that Asuka spoke again, her voice full of wistfulness.  
她投来的目光颇为怪异。直到真嗣开始觉得想躲起来时，明日香才再次开口，声音中满是惆怅。

"Where did he go?" “他去哪儿了？”

Shinji blinked. "What?" 真嗣眨了眨眼。"什么？"

"He was here, but he's gone now. Where did he go, Shinji?"  
“他刚才还在这里，现在却不见了。他去哪儿了，真嗣？”

He didn't have an answer for that. There was no way he could answer a question he didn't even understand. After a while, Asuka sighed, retracting her hand. "I'm babbling. I'm not making any sense, am I."  
他对此无言以对。一个他连理解都做不到的问题，又怎能回答呢？过了一会儿，明日香叹了口气，收回了手。“我在胡言乱语。我说的根本没道理，对吧。”

Shinji nodded. "No, you're not."  
真嗣点点头。“不，你没在胡说。”

Her strange mood was gone just as quickly as it came, a rueful smile returning to her face. "So, how am I supposed to repay you? Do I have to touch you through the suit? I honestly don't know how boys do it."  
她那奇怪的情绪来得快去得也快，脸上又浮现出一丝苦笑。“那么，我该怎么报答你呢？要我隔着衣服碰你吗？老实说，我真不知道男孩子是怎么做的。”

"What?" "什么？"

Instead of answering, Asuka banged her head against the armrest before covering her face with both hands again.  
阿斯卡没有回答，而是将头重重地撞在扶手上，随后再次用双手捂住了脸。

"I must be out of my mind. I'll probably regret all of this. You'd better get everything you can from me before I change my mind."  
“我一定是疯了。我可能会后悔这一切。你最好在我改变主意之前，尽可能从我这里得到你想要的一切。”

"Asuka...what am I supposed to be paid for?"  
“阿斯卡……我应该得到什么报酬呢？”

Asuka's middle and index fingers parted to reveal a single eye. "What?"  
明日香的中指和食指分开，露出一颗眼睛。“什么？”

Instead of answering or repeating the question, Shinji just chewed his lips, eyeing her uncertainly. Silence descended for a moment.  
真嗣没有回答或重复问题，只是咬着嘴唇，不确定地看着她。沉默笼罩了一会儿。

"You're not seriously asking that, are you?"  
“你不会是认真的吧？”

Shinji was at a loss for words. Actually, he had a few things to say, but none of them were even remotely intelligent. There were a few theories floating around in his mind about what Asuka's words meant, but Shinji couldn't bring himself to say them.  
真嗣无言以对。实际上，他有些话想说，但没有一个听起来是明智的。他脑海中浮现出几个关于明日香话语含义的理论，但真嗣无法让自己说出口。

Asuka groaned in frustration as Shinji remained silent. "I'm asking you how I can make you, ugggh, c-c-_cum._ I want to pay you back."  
明日香因真嗣的沉默而懊恼地呻吟。"我是在问你，我怎样才能让你，啊，达，达，高潮。我想回报你。"

A shiver ran down Shinji's spine. He couldn't believe what he was hearing, but here they were. But then again, everything that had happened between him and Asuka lately had been a very consistent series of things he couldn't believe he was hearing.  
真嗣的脊背一阵发凉。他不敢相信自己所听到的，但事实就是如此。不过话说回来，最近他和明日香之间发生的一切，都是一系列他难以置信的事情。

Asuka pushed herself up, making a disgruntled sound. "Well, you don't have to tell me. I'll figure it out myself. Can't be that hard. Come here."  
明日香撑起身来，发出不满的声音。“好吧，你不用告诉我。我自己会弄明白的。不会太难。过来。”

Shinji yelped and slammed his back against the table. A sharp pain ran down his spine and knocked the air out of his lungs. Looking up at Asuka, who had sat up, Shinji shook his head.  
真嗣惊叫一声，猛地背靠桌子。一阵剧痛沿着脊椎传来，让他喘不过气来。抬头看着坐起来的明日香，真嗣摇了摇头。

"Ayanami will be back soon," he blurted out.  
“绫波很快就会回来，”他脱口而出。

Asuka snorted. "Don't you think she's seen enough already?"  
明日香哼了一声。“你不觉得她已经看得够多了吗？”

"W-what if we get a call from the Command Center? What if the Angel attacks?"  
“万……万一司令部打电话来怎么办？万一使徒来袭呢？”

"This is the third time we've had this conversation."  
“这是我们第三次进行这种对话了。”

Shinji gritted his teeth. He actually had no idea why he was refusing Asuka's offer at this point, and even now, a part of him was screaming at him to just give in and do as he was told, but it just didn't seem right, not here, not now.  
真嗣咬紧牙关。他其实并不清楚为何此时要拒绝明日香的帮助，甚至此刻内心有一部分在尖叫着让他屈服，照吩咐行事，但就是感觉不对，不是在这里，不是在现在。

"It's, it's going to get really dirty, it's going to be a total mess," he stammered.  
“这，这会弄得很脏，会一团糟的，”他结结巴巴地说。

Asuka shrugged. "What makes you think I'm not a total mess right now?" Then Asuka started to pull her hair out with both hands. "I'll probably regret saying that too..." She shook her head, as if to clear it. "Speaking of which, I'm going to go take a shower. Change into a fresh suit, too. If they set off any alarms in the meantime, it's all your fault."  
明日香耸了耸肩。“你怎么会觉得我现在不是一团糟呢？”接着明日香开始用双手扯自己的头发。“我可能也会后悔说这话……”她摇了摇头，仿佛想清醒些。“话说回来，我要去洗个澡。换套干净的衣服。如果他们在这期间触发任何警报，都是你的错。”

Asuka shook her head. Asuka 摇了摇头。

Asuka's legs buckled as she stood up. Shinji quickly got to his feet and supported her, one hand on her side and the other in her armpit, which somehow turned into a hug. Asuka leaned into Shinji and brought her mouth to his ear. "I'm not letting you off the hook," she whispered. Her breath on his ear sent tingles radiating down his entire body. "You'll see me when we're back at home."  
明日香站起来时双腿一软。真嗣迅速起身扶住她，一手搭在她腰侧，另一手托在她腋下，不知怎的变成了一个拥抱。明日香靠向真嗣，将嘴凑到他耳边。“我不会轻易放过你的，”她低语道。她的气息拂过他的耳畔，让他全身一阵酥麻。“等回家后，你等着瞧吧。”

Without waiting for an answer, Asuka slipped out of his arms and staggered to the door. Shinji could see that her plugsuit was heavily wrinkled from not being properly compressed in the back.  
不等他回应，明日香便从他怀中滑出，踉跄着走向门口。真嗣注意到她的插入栓服因背部未被妥善压缩而皱巴巴的。

"And call Misato and ask what we are supposed to do for breakfast! Ask if there's a cafeteria open or something!" was the last thing Asuka said, half-turning her head over her shoulder, before opening the door. Shinji nodded hastily.  
“还有，打电话给美里，问问我们早餐该做什么！问问有没有开着的食堂什么的！”明日香在开门前半转过头，抛下这句话。真嗣连忙点头。

He felt dizzy. He couldn't even think about the implications of Asuka's words; he felt like he would lose his mind if he did. He regretted what he had just done. The events of the past few hours had been so overwhelming that he'd rather fight an Angel right here and now than deal with this anymore. He took a deep breath and sat down on the couch.  
他感到头晕目眩。甚至无法思考明日香的话意味着什么；他觉得自己如果去想，就会失去理智。他后悔刚刚所做的事。过去几个小时的事件太过压倒性，他宁愿立刻与使徒战斗，也不愿再面对这一切。他深吸一口气，坐在了沙发上。

He thought about the state Asuka had left the room in. The motions she made with her hips. _What makes you think I'm not a total mess right now?_  
他回想起明日香离开房间时的状态。她扭动腰肢的动作。你凭什么认为我现在不是一团糟？

Then something occurred to Shinji that made his breathing stop.  
然后，某个念头闪过真嗣的脑海，让他屏住了呼吸。

_Did that mean that girls could…?  
那是不是意味着女生们可以……？_

### Chapter 15 Angel of the sky (3)

Shinji quietly left the lounge to find Ayanami, leaving a sleeping Asuka behind.  
真嗣悄悄离开了休息室去寻找绫波，留下熟睡的明日香在身后。

Ayanami still hadn't returned by the time Asuka had finished showering and changing. The two of them proceeded to eat an early breakfast of leftover snacks from last night, making small talk all the while. Neither of them said a word about the Angel looming over them and the impending battle. Nor did they broach the topic of the _payback_ Asuka had promised for tonight.  
当明日香洗完澡并换好衣服时，绫波仍未回来。两人开始吃起了昨晚剩下的零食作为早饭，边吃边闲聊。他们都没有提及悬在他们头顶的天使和即将到来的战斗，也没有谈到明日香承诺今晚要进行的报复。

After a while, Asuka laid down on the couch, saying she was tired from lack of sleep and their recent exertions. She nagged the reluctant Shinji to join her, but after several attempts, it turned out the couch wasn't large enough for them to sleep side by side, so Shinji decided to squat on the floor in front of her instead. He watched her face, utterly entranced. She'd been in such a good mood, acting almost…_sweet_ to him. Her features slowly slackened as sleep took her, but the soft smile she'd given him as she closed her eyes never quite disappeared from her lips. Shinji could spend forever looking at that smile.  
过了一会儿，明日香躺在沙发上，说她因为缺乏睡眠和最近的劳累而感到疲惫。她催促犹豫不决的真嗣也躺下，但尝试了几次后发现沙发不够大，两人无法并排躺下，于是真嗣决定蹲在她面前的地板上。他凝视着她的脸，完全被吸引住了。她心情很好，对他几乎表现得……很温柔。她的面部表情随着入睡而逐渐放松，但她闭上眼睛时给他的那个温柔微笑，始终没有从她的唇边消失。真嗣可以永远看着那个微笑。

He very nearly did, until the weight of the silence in the lounge settled heavily on his shoulders and he abruptly realized that Ayanami was still missing. Thoughts of the upcoming battle followed swiftly after, descending on him like an avalanche. Shinji grimaced, feeling conflicted.  
他几乎就要这么做了，直到休息室里沉重的寂静压在他的肩上，他突然意识到绫波仍然不见踪影。紧接着，对即将到来的战斗的思绪如雪崩般袭来。真嗣皱起眉头，感到内心矛盾重重。

He was worried about Ayanami and felt that he had to find her somehow, but was afraid of being AWOL at the moment the command center announced an emergency. He was also afraid of how Asuka would react if she woke up and saw that he wasn't there and found out it was because of Ayanami. Of the two, the fear of the latter was greater. Shinji feared disrupting Asuka's good mood even more than he feared disappointing Misato and sabotaging her battle plan. What did that say about him? He shook his head, steeled his resolve, and stood up.  
他担心绫波，觉得必须设法找到她，但又害怕在指挥中心宣布紧急情况时擅自离岗。他也害怕如果明日香醒来发现他不在，得知是因为绫波的话，她会有何反应。相比之下，后者更让他恐惧。真嗣更害怕破坏明日香的好心情，甚至超过了害怕让美里失望并破坏她的作战计划。这反映了他怎样的心态？他摇了摇头，坚定了决心，站起身来。

As soon as he did that, Asuka mumbled something unintelligible, making Shinji freeze on the spot. Only after it became clear she was still asleep did Shinji smile weakly, tuck a stray hair away from her mouth, and head for the door.  
他刚一站起来，明日香就咕哝了一句听不清的话，让真嗣僵在原地。直到确认她还在熟睡，真嗣才虚弱地笑了笑，将一缕散乱的头发从她嘴边拨开，然后向门口走去。

The first place Shinji checked was the locker room. It was a logical hiding place: not too far away, no risk of intruders, and a bunch of benches where you could sleep. But there was no sign of Ayanami inside. The only other occupant was Asuka's discarded plugsuit, its limbs strewn about like a corpse's. The shower room, connected to the locker room by a single large door, was dark and empty.  
真嗣首先检查的是更衣室。这是个合乎逻辑的藏身之处：不太远，没有入侵者的风险，还有许多长凳可以睡觉。但里面并没有绫波的踪影。唯一的其他存在是明日香丢弃的插入栓服，它的四肢散落一地，宛如一具尸体。与更衣室相连的淋浴间，通过一扇大门，此刻也是漆黑而空荡。

After that, Shinji wandered the empty halls of headquarters with no clear direction in mind. As he walked, his unease grew. The usual background noise of PA announcements and NERV personnel was absent, leaving in its place a strange, eerie quiet. The sound of his footsteps scuffing forlornly against the cold metal floor felt too loud. He had yet to encounter a single other person. At first, Shinji chalked it up to the early hour. But then he realized it was still too quiet, considering the fact that an Angel had appeared. By all rights, this place should be swarming like an anthill.  
之后，真嗣在没有明确方向的情况下，漫无目的地在总部的空旷走廊里徘徊。他走着，不安感逐渐增强。平日里背景中播放的 PA 公告和 NERV 人员的嘈杂声消失了，取而代之的是一种诡异的寂静。他的脚步声在冰冷的金属地板上拖沓作响，显得格外刺耳。他至今还未遇到任何其他人。起初，真嗣将其归咎于清晨时分。但随后他意识到，考虑到使徒的出现，这里本应像蚁穴般繁忙，此刻却过于安静了。

Perhaps subconsciously guided there by his growing anxiety, he found himself at the main entrance of the HQ pyramid. Usually a bustling place of people and armed guards, it was instead eerily empty and totally silent. The sound of his own breathing echoed in his ears. He watched dust motes drift through the beams of pale morning light filtering through the windows and frowned.  
或许是潜意识中被日益增长的焦虑所牵引，他发现自己来到了总部金字塔的主入口。平日里人声鼎沸、武装警卫穿梭的地方，此刻却异常空旷，寂静无声。他自己的呼吸声在耳边回响。他看着尘埃在透过窗户的苍白晨光中飘荡，皱起了眉头。

Something was off. He was sure of it by then. Something must have happened while he was sleeping, or while he was fooling around with Asuka.  
有些不对劲。他那时确信无疑。一定是在他睡觉时，或是和明日香嬉闹时发生了什么。

He considered finding a phone to call Ms. Misato, but then hesitated. He'd called her earlier while Asuka was showering, but Ms. Misato had told him curtly that she was very busy and couldn't talk right now, and then hung up without waiting for his reply. There was even a hint of annoyance in her voice.  
他考虑找部电话打给美里小姐，但又犹豫了。之前明日香在洗澡时他曾打过一次，但美里小姐简短地告诉他现在很忙，无法交谈，没等他回应就挂断了电话。她的语气中甚至带着一丝不耐烦。

And what would he tell her? That he was freaking out because he disobeyed orders and left the lounge only to find HQ deserted? Or that Ayanami had also disobeyed orders and disappeared because he may or may not have made Asuka…_cum_ right in front of her?  
那他该告诉她什么呢？是因为他违抗命令离开休息室，却发现总部空无一人而感到恐慌？还是说绫波也违抗了命令，消失不见，可能是因为他让明日香……在她面前达到了高潮？

Shinji felt heat rise in his cheeks. He couldn't say _any_ of that, obviously.  
真嗣感到脸颊发热。显然，这些他一个字也说不出口。

He swallowed hard and headed for the nearest pedestrian exit.  
他艰难地咽了口唾沫，朝最近的行人出口走去。

Humid air heavy with the smell of grass filled his nostrils as soon as the automatic doors opened. He groaned and lifted a hand to shade his eyes, momentarily dazzled by the bright morning light pouring in from high above. Only once his eyes adjusted could Shinji fully appreciate the glorious sight of dawn within the Geofront. Asphalt roads stretched out into open grasslands, and, further from the pyramid, lush patches of coniferous forest extended to the faraway edges of the subterranean cavern. In the distance, a huge lake, glittering under the light, spewed out a mist that had covered the whole Geofront.  
自动门一开，湿润的空气中夹杂着青草的气息立刻涌入他的鼻腔。他呻吟一声，举手遮挡眼睛，被高处倾泻而下的明媚晨光晃得一时眼花。直到视线适应，真嗣才能完全欣赏到地底都市中黎明的壮丽景象。柏油路延伸至开阔的草地，远离金字塔的地方，茂密的针叶林一直延伸到地下洞穴的遥远边缘。远处，一个巨大的湖泊在阳光下闪闪发光，喷出的雾气覆盖了整个地底都市。

Shinji was no stranger to this place. He'd come here so many times that he thought he had gotten used to it by now. The awe he'd felt on his first descent into the complex had grown dull. But most of his experience of the place had been from the subway tracks descending from the city center high above. While the view from such a vantage point was impressive indeed, it was a totally different feeling to actually stand in the middle of this place as he was doing now. It made him realize the true vastness and beauty of the Geofront in a way he hadn't managed previously.  
真嗣对这里并不陌生。他来过这里太多次，以至于他认为自己现在已经习惯了。第一次深入这个复杂建筑时的敬畏感已经变得迟钝。但他大部分时间都是从城市中心高处下降的地铁轨道上观察这里。尽管从那样的有利位置看去确实令人印象深刻，但像现在这样真正站在这个地方的中央，却是一种完全不同的感受。这让他以一种之前未曾做到的方式，意识到地底都市的真正广阔与美丽。

Inhaling the cool, humid air deeply, Shinji looked around. Like headquarters, the Geofront was devoid of any human presence. There wasn't a single car in sight on any of the roads. The pedestrian walkways were in an identical state. The beams of light that usually slanted up and down the walls of the great cavern were nowhere to be seen, which meant that the trains must have stopped too. He squinted, looking closer, but there was not so much as a flash of light to be seen.  
深吸一口清凉湿润的空气，真嗣环顾四周。与总部一样，地底都市也空无一人。道路上不见一辆车影，人行道亦是同样空荡。平日里在巨大洞窟壁上上下斜照的光束也消失无踪，这意味着列车想必也已停运。他眯起眼睛仔细观察，却连一丝光亮都未曾捕捉到。

_What the hell is going on?_ he wondered nervously. Had the angel perhaps already attacked, somehow making everyone except him and Asuka disappear? But there would have at least been a call, an alarm, _something,_ if that had happened. Just then, a smear of motion out of the corner of his eye interrupted his thoughts. A flock of birds soared out of the woods, their calls audible even from this distance. The uneasiness that had filled his chest was forgotten as he watched their trajectory across the surface of the lake. The wedge formation soon crossed the water and disappeared behind the pyramid. Shinji blinked, and noticed a small path on the ground just beneath where the birds had disappeared. It was very narrow, barely wide enough for one adult, and unpaved, branching off from the main pedestrian avenue and disappearing into a small patch of trees a little ways away from the base of the pyramid. He stared at it. It looked like exactly the kind of hidden spot someone would disappear down to be alone. He began walking towards it.  
这到底是怎么回事？他紧张地思索着。难道天使已经发动了攻击，不知怎地让除了他和明日香之外的所有人消失了？但如果是那样，至少会有警报声，或是某种警示。就在这时，眼角捕捉到的一抹动静打断了他的思绪。一群鸟从树林中振翅高飞，即使相隔甚远，它们的鸣叫声依然清晰可闻。他凝视着它们在湖面上划过的轨迹，胸中的不安感暂时被遗忘。鸟群的楔形编队很快掠过水面，消失在金字塔后方。真嗣眨了眨眼，注意到鸟群消失处下方地面上有一条小径。这条小径非常狭窄，仅够一人通行，未经铺设，从主要人行道分岔出来，消失在距离金字塔底部不远处的一小片树林中。他凝视着它，看起来就像是一个人为了独处而消失其中的隐秘之地。他开始朝它走去。

The hard plastic soles of his plugsuit offered little in the way of cushion for the soles of his feet. They tingled uncomfortably as he walked over stones and twigs and uneven dirt.  
他那插头服的硬塑料鞋底对脚掌的缓冲作用微乎其微。走在石头、树枝和凹凸不平的泥土上，脚底传来阵阵不适的刺痛。

He soon entered a small wooded area, with trees blocking his view in all directions. He could still make out the giant pyramid rising above the trees to his right, but even so, he began to wonder if he had gone too far. The path continued ahead of him with no end in sight. Maybe Ayanami didn't come this way after all. Just as he became nervous enough to decide it was time to turn around and head back to headquarters, the trees abruptly gave way and Shinji found himself standing in unfiltered sunlight. He gasped in surprise.  
他很快进入了一片小树林，四周的树木遮挡了视线。他仍能辨认出右侧树梢上方耸立的巨大金字塔，但即便如此，他开始怀疑自己是否走得太远了。小径在他前方延伸，不见尽头。或许绫波并没有走这条路。正当他紧张到决定是时候转身返回总部时，树木突然消失，真嗣发现自己站在了无遮挡的阳光下。他惊讶得倒吸了一口气。

In front of him there was a garden, or what used to be one. The place looked like it hadn't been maintained in some time. On one side, he could see the lake glittering under the sun, and on the other, plains stretching into the distance. Weathered-looking marble columns and crumbling arches, covered with vines and discolored by exposure, dotted the clearing in front of him. They were rather reminiscent of the ruins of ancient Greece or Rome. Stone benches in a similar state of disrepair poked up through the tangled undergrowth between them. Shinji slowly walked over to the nearest one and plopped down. The stone surface was glistening with morning dew, but it didn't matter. Plugsuits were perfectly waterproof, after all.  
在他面前曾是一片花园，如今却已面目全非。这个地方似乎已经很久无人打理。一侧，他能看到湖面在阳光下闪烁，另一侧则是绵延至远方的平原。风化的石柱和崩塌的拱门，被藤蔓覆盖并因暴露而褪色，点缀在他面前的空地上。这些景象让人不禁联想到古希腊或罗马的废墟。同样破败的石凳在它们之间的杂草丛中若隐若现。真嗣缓缓走向最近的一个石凳，坐了下来。石面因晨露而闪闪发光，但这无关紧要。毕竟，驾驶服是完全防水的。

A breeze blew in from the lake, filling Shinji's nostrils with the wet, cool smell of grass. A lonely pillar reared up beside him, disconnected from any ceiling or arch. It was covered in thick, trailing vines that dripped down to tickle his forehead, fluttering in the breeze. Shinji let out a pleasant sigh.  
一阵微风从湖面吹来，充满了青草湿润凉爽的气息，涌入真嗣的鼻腔。一根孤零零的柱子在他身旁耸立，与任何屋顶或拱门都失去了联系。它被厚厚的藤蔓覆盖，藤蔓滴落下来轻拂他的额头，随风轻轻摇曳。真嗣发出了一声惬意的叹息。

Being outside after being stuck in the stuffy air underground was quite literally a breath of fresh air. The cool breeze, the panoramic view, and the warm sunlight were exactly what Shinji needed right now. He gazed out over the plains. They disappeared into a blue wall that at first glance could be mistaken for a real sky, a real horizon. It was hard to believe that he was still underground, inside something that was technically a cave.  
从地下那闷热的空气中解脱出来，呼吸到外面的空气，简直就像是一股清新的气息。凉爽的微风、广阔的视野和温暖的阳光正是真嗣现在所需要的。他凝视着平原，它们消失在一堵蓝色墙壁中，乍一看可能会被误认为是真实的天空，真实的地平线。很难相信他仍然在地下，在一个从技术上讲是洞穴的地方。

It was perfect. Well. Not quite. He shook his head slightly. There was one thing that was missing.  
这太完美了。嗯，也不完全是。他轻轻摇了摇头。还缺一样东西。

Asuka. Shinji's fellow pilot. His housemate. His sassy girlfriend.  
明日香。真嗣的同僚驾驶员。他的室友。他那爱挖苦人的女朋友。

He wished she was sitting here with him, enjoying the cool morning air. Watching the peaceful view in silence for a while, listening to the birds chirping.  
他希望她能陪他坐在这里，享受清晨的凉爽空气。静静地观赏这宁静的景色，聆听鸟儿的鸣叫。

_Maybe I should take her here for our next date_.  
或许下次约会我应该带她来这里。

He wondered how long it would take to walk around the lake. Was there even a path around it, or would they have to go through the woods? If the walk was too long or the path was too rough, they could maybe have a picnic at a different, equally secluded spot.  
他好奇绕湖走一圈需要多长时间。湖边是否有小径，还是他们得穿过树林？如果步行太远或路径太崎岖，他们或许可以在另一个同样隐蔽的地方野餐。

But then again, would Asuka like it? Shinji's impression was that Asuka liked crowded, busy places in urban centers, like department stores, and would find the idea of strolling through nature utterly boring.  
但话说回来，明日香会喜欢吗？真嗣的印象中，明日香喜欢城市中心热闹拥挤的地方，比如百货商店，她会觉得在自然中漫步无聊透顶。

Or not. Maybe she would like the idea of a tranquil lakeside picnic, sitting together under the shade of a tree. She would be able to fool around with him as much as she wanted to with no one else around to notice.  
或者也不一定。也许她会喜欢宁静的湖畔野餐，两人一起坐在树荫下。她可以随心所欲地和他嬉闹，周围没有其他人会注意到。

Or maybe Shinji was projecting his own mindset onto Asuka. Come to think of it, Asuka told him yesterday that she planned to be unabashedly touchy with him at school. The advantage of not having to worry about what others might see and think would be purely for Shinji's benefit. Asuka probably wouldn't care either way.  
或许真嗣是在将自己的心态投射到明日香身上。想想看，昨日明日香告诉他，她打算在学校里毫不掩饰地与他亲密接触。不必担心别人看到和怎么想，这对真嗣来说纯粹是种优势。明日香大概也不会在意这些。

Shinji let out a small sigh. It was yet another reminder of how little he actually knew about his girlfriend.  
真嗣轻轻叹了口气。这又是一个提醒，让他意识到自己对女友的了解是多么的少。

_I'll ask her later,_ Shinji thought, then felt his chest tighten.  
我稍后再问她吧，真嗣心想，随即感到胸口一阵紧缩。

The battle. The Angel. He should be worrying about whether he'd survive at all, not about something as inconsequential as a date plan. Even if he didn't die, he might get injured, like Asuka did after the last battle, or how he did in the volcano.  
战斗。使徒。他应该担心的是自己能否活下来，而不是像约会计划这样无关紧要的事情。即便他不会死，也可能会受伤，就像上次战斗后明日香那样，或是像他在火山中那样。

Then, something strange ballooned up in Shinji's chest. He swallowed, the inexplicable sensation making his eyes twitch. There was a lump in his throat.  
然后，一种奇怪的感觉在真嗣的胸中膨胀起来。他咽了咽口水，这种难以名状的感觉让他的眼睛不由自主地抽动。他的喉咙里像是卡了块东西。

Shinji didn't want to die. He didn't want to get hurt. Not that he'd ever wanted such things before, but now something sharper and more desperate had crept into the mix, something almost akin to anger.  
真嗣不想死。他不想受伤。虽然他以前从未有过这样的想法，但现在一种更尖锐、更绝望的情绪悄然混入其中，几乎接近愤怒。

He didn't want to lose the opportunity to be with Asuka.  
他不想失去与明日香在一起的机会。

Clearing his burning throat, Shinji looked up. A blue not-quite-sky filled his vision.  
清了清灼热的喉咙，真嗣抬头望去。一片不甚真实的蓝色天空填满了他的视野。

He was vaguely aware that what he was feeling wasn't just anger and desperation. Excitement swirled through the mix as well as a strange, warm, fluttering feeling. Just like what he felt for Asuka.  
他隐约意识到，自己感受到的不仅仅是愤怒和绝望。兴奋感也在其中交织，伴随着一种奇异的、温暖的、悸动的感觉。就像他对明日香的感觉一样。

Shinji raised his hand. The blue rubber glistened in the sunlight. He turned it over to look at the palm. The suit creaked as he clenched his fist. Shinji smiled to himself.  
真嗣举起手。蓝色的橡胶在阳光下闪闪发亮。他翻过手掌，看着掌心。当他握紧拳头时，紧身衣发出了吱吱声。真嗣暗自微笑。

He made Asuka...happy. Shinji remembered the heat of her beneath him, the feeling of her body pressed against him, her ragged breathing, her flushed face. It was something he could never give up or give away, and it was also a kind of proof. That he...could do it, whatever that was. Proof that it was possible for him.  
他让明日香...感到快乐。真嗣记得她在他身下的热度，她身体紧贴着他的感觉，她急促的呼吸，她泛红的脸颊。这是他永远无法放弃或给予他人的，也是一种证明。证明他...能做到，无论那是什么。证明这对他来说是可能的。

A smile appeared on his lips, but his eyes filled with tears at the same time. Yeah, Angel or whatever, he would…  
他的唇边浮现出一丝微笑，但眼中同时盈满了泪水。是啊，天使也好，其他什么也罢，他会…

"Weren't you told to wait in the pilot's lounge? Do I need to dress down Maya for this?"  
“不是让你在驾驶员休息室等吗？我需要为此训斥玛雅吗？”

A familiar high-pitched voice cut through Shinji's thoughts. He flinched for a moment, then quickly turned towards it. Beyond the crumbling archway, in the shade of a tree that Shinji hadn't paid much attention to before, sat Ms. Misato, staring at him. Beside her was a bottle of instant coffee, 250ml sized, with its lid off. There was an odd smile on her face, and, while her usual playful tone was still there, somehow Shinji felt an uncomfortable vibe coming from her. He bit his lower lip.  
一个熟悉的高亢声音打断了真嗣的思绪。他微微一颤，随即迅速转向声音来源。在破败的拱门之外，一棵真嗣之前未曾留意的树荫下，坐着美里小姐，正盯着他看。她旁边是一瓶即溶咖啡，250 毫升大小，瓶盖已打开。她脸上带着一种奇怪的微笑，尽管她平时的俏皮语气依旧，但真嗣不知为何感到一股不自在的氛围。他咬了咬下唇。

"It's not Ms. Maya's fault, I got the message just fine, I just…"  
“这不是真希小姐的错，我确实收到了消息，只是……”

Shinji couldn't say that he'd gone out looking for Ayanami and ended up here, because then he would have to explain why Ayanami of all people disobeyed the order. Shinji swallowed hard. "I thought it was a little stuffy inside. I needed some air."  
真嗣无法说出他本想去找绫波却来到这里，因为那样他就得解释为什么偏偏是绫波违抗了命令。真嗣艰难地咽了咽口水。“我觉得里面有点闷，需要出来透透气。”

Misato gave a small nod and turned her gaze away, to the lake. She didn't look too interested in scolding him.  
美里轻轻点了点头，将目光移向湖面。她似乎并不太想责备他。

As Shinji concluded he was safe now, Misato's lips turned up again. "You're not apologizing."  
当真嗣以为自己已经安全时，美里的嘴角再次上扬。“你还没道歉呢。”

_What?_ he almost asked back, but the question died in his throat. Smiling awkwardly, Shinji scratched his head.  
什么？他差点反问回去，但问题卡在了喉咙里。真嗣尴尬地笑了笑，挠了挠头。

"I, I'm sorry. I know I was supposed to stay put..."  
"我，我很抱歉。我知道我应该待在原地..."

With a snort, Misato picked up her coffee and stood up. Her black hair swayed slightly with the movement. As Shinji watched blankly, she strode over and stood directly in front of him, her gaze still fixed on the lake. She lifted her coffee to her mouth and took a sip.  
美里哼了一声，拿起咖啡站了起来。她的黑发随着动作微微摇曳。真嗣茫然地看着她大步走过来，直接站在他面前，目光依旧凝视着湖面。她将咖啡举到嘴边，喝了一口。

"You had a lot going on in your head, so you wanted to find someplace to calm down and collect your thoughts, right?"  
"你脑子里有很多事情，所以你想找个地方冷静下来，整理思绪，对吧？"

Shinji blinked. Was he that obvious? If she guessed this right then maybe she also knew _why._ Maybe she somehow already knew what Shinji and Asuka had just done.  
真嗣眨了眨眼。他有这么明显吗？如果她猜对了，那么也许她也知道为什么。也许她不知怎么地已经知道真嗣和明日香刚刚做了什么。

At the last thought, Shinji's stomach tightened and heat rose to his face. Ms. Misato looked over at him and chuckled. She plopped down next to him.  
想到这里，真嗣的胃紧缩起来，脸上也热了起来。美里小姐朝他看了一眼，轻声笑了起来。她一屁股坐在他旁边。

"Well, I don't know about you, but that's why I came out here."  
“好吧，我不知道你怎么样，但我出来这里就是为了这个。”

Shinji swallowed hard and nodded. He wanted to ask her what was bothering her so much, but he swallowed that back too. It would be weirder if he encountered someone here who _wasn't_ worried. The Angel was coming, after all. Just like when he woke Asuka earlier, he realized that something was indeed wrong with him as a pilot. His priorities were still in the wrong place.  
真嗣艰难地咽了口唾沫，点了点头。他想问她到底是什么事情让她如此困扰，但他也把这个问题咽了回去。如果在这里遇到一个不担心的人，那才奇怪呢。毕竟使徒就要来了。就像他之前叫醒明日香时一样，他意识到自己作为驾驶员确实有问题。他的优先事项仍然放错了位置。

Ms. Misato put one hand on the bench and leaned back.  
美里小姐一只手搭在长椅上，向后靠去。

"Did you kids have breakfast?"  
“你们吃早饭了吗？”

Her tone was the complete opposite of the one she'd used when he called her earlier about this very thing. Of course, he hadn't had a chance to really ask her about it.  
她的语气与之前他打电话给她讨论这件事时的截然相反。当然，他还没机会真正问她。

Shinji nodded. "Yeah, we ate leftovers from last night. Snacks Mr. Kaji bought us, I mean."  
真嗣点点头。“嗯，我们吃了昨晚的剩菜。我是说，加治先生给我们买的零食。”

Only then did Shinji realize that it was applicable only to him and Asuka, and that he had no idea where Ayanami was or if she had even eaten anything. But he couldn't bring himself to mention it.  
直到那时，真嗣才意识到这仅适用于他和明日香，而他完全不知道绫波在哪里，或者她是否吃过任何东西。但他无法让自己提及这一点。

"Good. Not like I had anywhere to take you."  
"好。反正我也没地方带你去。"

"They don't serve breakfast at headquarters? Does that mean shift workers eat nothing in the morning?" Shinji wondered if he should start packing Ms. Misato a breakfast bento for her frequent night shifts. It was something he never thought of until now.  
""总部不提供早餐吗？那是不是意味着轮班人员早上都不吃东西？"" 真嗣在想，他是否应该开始为美里小姐频繁的夜班准备早餐便当。这是他以前从未考虑过的事情。

Misato let out a small sigh. "There are designated cafeterias, open 24 hours a day. I had them evacuated along with all the non-essential personnel and the entire city above our heads. Didn't you hear the broadcast earlier? You slept through it, right?"  
美里轻轻叹了口气。""有指定的 24 小时开放的食堂。我把它们和所有非必要人员以及我们头顶上的整个城市一起疏散了。你之前没听到广播吗？你当时睡过去了，对吧？""

Shinji flinched for a moment but then remembered that he hadn't been told to stay up all night, and it wasn't wrong for him to take a nap in between. He also realized what he saw and felt inside headquarters was not his imagination. The place was truly deserted. The full implications of Misato's words hit him all at once, sending a chill down his spine.  
真嗣微微一颤，随即想起并没有人要求他彻夜不眠，中途小憩并无不妥。他也意识到，自己在总部内所见所感并非幻觉。这个地方确实空无一人。美里的话的全部含义突然击中了他，令他脊背发凉。

"...Evacuated, you say?" “……你是说，疏散了？”

Misato tilted her head and smiled wryly. "A compromise of sorts between the MAGI's suggestion and my own plan. The MAGI urged us not to attempt a defense and abandon the city. I wanted to fight."  
美里歪了歪头，苦笑道：“算是 MAGI 的建议和我的计划之间的一种妥协吧。MAGI 敦促我们不要尝试防御，放弃城市。而我想要战斗。”

Her tone was almost amused, but Shinji felt there was something just a little off about her voice. Even her smile, visible as she sipped her coffee, was stiff and frozen.  
她的语气几乎带着笑意，但真嗣觉得她的声音里有些许不对劲。就连她喝咖啡时露出的微笑，也显得僵硬而凝固。

"While you were sleeping, the Angel launched an attack, detaching parts of its body and dropping them to the ground, like a bombing or something."  
“你睡觉的时候，使徒发动了攻击，它分离出部分身体，像投弹一样扔到地面上。”

Misato glanced at Shinji's direction, then let out a laugh.  
美里瞥了一眼真嗣的方向，然后笑出声来。

"Don't worry. It completely missed us and we knew it would from the start. That's why we didn't wake up you kids. There wasn't a threat to this side of the world... yet." She took a sip. "There's a lot of trouble in the Indian Ocean right now, though. The Seychelles, Mauritius…have you heard those names?"  
"别担心。它完全错过了我们，我们从一开始就知道。这就是为什么我们没有叫醒你们这些孩子。这个世界这一边没有受到威胁……还不到时候。" 她抿了一口。"不过，印度洋现在有很多麻烦。塞舌尔、毛里求斯……你听说过这些名字吗？"

Shinji tried hard but nothing came to mind. "Are those countries that got wiped out by the Second Impact?"  
真嗣努力回想，但脑海中一片空白。"那些是第二次冲击中被毁灭的国家吗？"

"No. Technically not. But this Angel might have finished the job. Its AT field is so strong it's interfering with our communications, so we don't have the full picture right now, but the mass that it dropped in the ocean was so large, it caused a tsunami. We haven't heard from any of the countries near enough to the impact yet. It must have been disastrous."  
"不，严格来说不是。但这个天使可能已经完成了这项工作。它的 AT 力场非常强大，干扰了我们的通讯，所以我们现在没有完整的情况，但它掉入海洋的质量如此之大，引发了海啸。我们还没有收到任何靠近冲击点的国家的消息。那一定是灾难性的。"

Misato smirked when she saw the look on Shinji's face. "You make the same face as Ritsuko."  
看到真嗣脸上的表情，美里微微一笑。“你这表情和律子一模一样。”

Once again, there was nothing for Shinji to add, so he kept silent. Misato didn't seem to expect any kind of reply from him. Shinji started to feel that maybe she just needed someone to vent to, not exactly to talk with.  
真嗣又一次无话可说，于是保持沉默。美里似乎并不期待他的任何回应。真嗣开始觉得，也许她只是需要一个倾诉的对象，并非真正要与他交谈。

"Do you think I'm too reckless, that I care more about my personal grudges than the success of the operation?" Misato asked suddenly, rounding on him.  
“你觉得我太鲁莽了吗？我是不是更在意个人恩怨，而不是行动的成功？”美里突然转身问他。

Shinji blinked. It was so out of context. Well, maybe not the bit about recklessness. He took a deep breath.  
真嗣眨了眨眼。这太不合时宜了。嗯，也许关于鲁莽的部分除外。他深吸了一口气。

"I don't understand, Ms. Misato."  
“我不明白，美里小姐。”

Instead of answering, Ms. Misato sipped her coffee again and looked away. After a few moments of silence, when she spoke again, it wasn't an answer to Shinji's question.  
美里小姐没有回答，而是再次啜饮她的咖啡，并移开了视线。在几秒钟的沉默之后，她再次开口，却并非回答真嗣的问题。

"Shinji. Why are you doing this? I mean, piloting the Evangelion. I never asked you, even though I ordered you around as if it was the most natural thing in the world. But why? Don't bother with heroic crap like 'I have to protect the world' or 'because there's no one else'. I want the real reason."  
"真嗣。你为什么要这么做？我是说，驾驶 EVA。我从没问过你，尽管我总是命令你，好像这是世界上最自然的事。但为什么？别扯什么英雄主义的废话，比如'我必须保护世界'或'因为没有其他人'。我要的是真正的理由。"

Maybe it was a woman thing to answer questions with more questions, Shinji thought. Asuka did it to him all the time, and now Ms. Misato was doing it too.  
也许用更多问题来回答问题是女人的天性，真嗣想。明日香总是这样对他，现在美里小姐也这样。

What crossed his mind next was his father's face. The face he'd seen when he'd first come here, staring down at him coldly from the observation deck high above the hangar.  
接下来浮现在他脑海中的是他父亲的脸。那是他刚到这里时看到的脸，从高高的观察甲板冷冷地俯视着他。

The reason to pilot Eva. Shinji frowned and looked away. "I don't know."  
驾驶 Eva 的理由。真嗣皱了皱眉，目光移开。“我不知道。”

Misato snorted. "You really don't know, or do you just not want to tell me?"  
美里哼了一声。“你是真的不知道，还是不想告诉我？”

Shinji kept his mouth shut. A moment later, there was a small clank as Misato set the coffee down on the bench.  
真嗣闭口不言。片刻后，随着美里将咖啡放在长椅上，传来了一声轻微的叮当声。

"It's alright, you don't have to. It's not like I don't have any guesses."  
"没事的，你不必说。我也不是没有猜测。"

_Do you?_ The words rose to the top of his throat. As uncomfortable as the topic was, Shinji was even more uncomfortable with Misato's general demeanor and the implications of her words. Not wanting to dwell on the subject for long, he tried to shift the focus back to Misato.  
你有吗？这些话涌到了他的喉咙口。尽管这个话题令人不适，但真嗣对美里的一般态度和她话语中的含义更加感到不安。不想长时间纠结于此，他试图将焦点转回美里身上。

"Do you have a reason, Ms. Misato? A personal reason to fight against the Angels? Is that why Ms. Ritsuko said such a thing?"  
"美里小姐，你有理由吗？一个个人理由去对抗使徒？这就是为什么律子小姐会说那样的话吗？"

The corner of her mouth lifted slightly as she stared blankly into the distance, but other than that, she gave no sign of acknowledgement. As the silence stretched longer and longer, Shinji assumed she wasn't going to answer.  
她嘴角微微上扬，目光空洞地凝视着远方，除此之外，没有任何表示知晓的迹象。随着沉默越来越长，真嗣以为她不会回答了。

He was wrong. When she opened her mouth, Ms. Misato's voice was strangely dreamy, almost a whisper. "Yeah. You wanna hear about it?"  
他错了。当她开口时，美里小姐的声音异常梦幻，近乎耳语。"嗯，你想听听吗？"

Puzzled, Shinji nodded. Misato smiled faintly and shook her head slightly to clear the bangs that had been poking her eyes. She lifted her head to look up at the sky and began to speak. Of opportunities that could have been taken but weren't, eroded to nothingness by time. Of hatred and resentment that had nowhere to go.  
真嗣困惑地点点头。美里淡淡一笑，轻轻摇头拂开遮住眼睛的刘海。她抬起头望向天空，开始讲述。那些本可以抓住却未曾把握的机会，随着时间流逝化为乌有。那些无处宣泄的仇恨与怨愤。

---

For the fifth or sixth time in the past minute, Asuka checked the clock in the upper right corner of her HUD. 11:36:21. Eighty-two seconds until launch.  
过去一分钟内，这是第五次还是第六次了，明日香再次检查了 HUD 右上角的时间。11:36:21。还有八十二秒就要发射了。

Frowning, Asuka checked the auxiliary comm windows below that. In one, the First, her eyes closed, her face serene. In the next, the command center. All that was visible was an empty chair, half turned, and flickers of motion from people bustling to and fro in the background.  
明日香皱着眉头，又查看了下方的辅助通讯窗口。一个窗口中，是绫波零，双眼闭合，面容宁静。下一个窗口，是指挥中心。只能看到一把半转的空椅子，以及背景中人们匆匆忙忙的闪动身影。

And finally, Shinji, in his Unit-01. He was looking off to the side, smiling faintly. Asuka realized that maybe he was looking at her, watching her through the comm window just as she was watching him. Asuka blushed slightly and turned her attention back to the front. She tried to compose herself as she looked around at the augmented-reality view of the Tokyo-3 landscape, which displayed the scope of her assigned area, key terrain features, supply points, defensive facilities, and the locations of her fellow pilots.  
最后是真嗣，在他的初号机里。他正侧目而视，微微一笑。明日香意识到，也许他正看着她，就像她通过通讯窗口看着他一样。明日香微微脸红，将注意力转回前方。她试图整理自己的情绪，环视着增强现实视角下的第三新东京市景观，显示着她被指派的区域范围、关键地形特征、补给点、防御设施以及同伴驾驶员的位置。

But try as she might, Asuka couldn't do anything about the discomfort that was filling her head and chest. It's not like anything was different about the situation. She sat in the entry plug and gulped LCL, same as always. But she couldn't shake the heaviness in her heart. It made her vaguely uneasy.  
但无论她如何努力，明日香都无法摆脱那充斥着她头部和胸腔的不适感。情况并没有什么不同。她一如既往地坐在插入栓里，吞咽着 LCL。但她就是无法摆脱心中的沉重感。这让她隐隐感到不安。

_Why? Why am I feeling like this? This place is supposed to be my home.  
为什么？为什么我会这样感觉？这个地方本该是我的家。_

Was she regretting the promise she made to Shinji this morning? Was she seriously more nervous about _that_ than her upcoming battle with a gigantic alien? She took a deep breath, letting her eyes flick back to his face in the comm window. Her heart fluttered as she remembered how _good_ it felt with him, a warm, soaring pleasure that she'd never felt before in her life, that she'd never managed to attain on her own. They'd jumped over a hurdle together, and Asuka was anticipating something even better later.  
她是在后悔今早对真嗣许下的承诺吗？她真的对这件事比即将与巨大外星生物的战斗还要紧张吗？她深吸了一口气，目光再次扫过通讯窗口中他的脸庞。想到与他在一起时的美好感觉，她的心跳加速了，那是一种温暖而令人愉悦的飞翔感，是她一生中从未体验过的，也是她独自一人从未达到过的。他们一起跨越了一个障碍，明日香期待着之后会有更好的事情发生。

So no, it wasn't about her promise. She wasn't exactly calm about what was going to happen tonight, but it wasn't the root cause of her current discomfort.  
所以不，这并非关乎她的承诺。她对今晚即将发生的事情并不完全平静，但这并非她当前不适的根本原因。

Was she worried about the First, who had disappeared at dawn, only to reappear in the briefing room later? Was Asuka worried about how much she had witnessed, and what she was thinking?  
她是否担心那位在黎明时分消失，随后又出现在简报室的首席？明日香是否担心她目睹了多少，以及她在想些什么？

Asuka gritted her teeth. Never. No way she cared about what that ghostly girl thought of anything, least of all herself and Shinji.  
明日香咬紧牙关。绝不可能。她才不在乎那个幽灵般的女孩对任何事情的看法，尤其是关于她自己和真嗣的。

Was she feeling overwhelmed by the absurd strength of the Angel?  
她是否被使徒那荒谬的力量压得喘不过气来？

The bastard was impressive, to be honest. It had already wreaked havoc in the Indian Ocean, South China, and Okinawa in three attacks, and, according to Misato, the next one would be right on target. It was no wonder that HQ, the city proper, and the surrounding area had been evacuated, leaving everything eerily empty and deserted. There was no point in risking the lives of peasants who wouldn't even be useful in the actual battle anyway.  
说实话，那混蛋确实令人印象深刻。它已经在印度洋、中国南部和冲绳进行了三次袭击，造成了巨大破坏，而且据美里所说，下一次攻击将直指目标。难怪总部、市区及周边地区都已疏散，留下一片诡异的空旷和荒凉。让那些在实际战斗中毫无用处的农民冒生命危险，实在没有意义。

And Misato's so-called "battle plan" was quite impressive on its own, with its brazen, shameless optimism. _When it starts to fall,_ Misato told them, _run to the projected impact site and intercept it with your own hands._ And all that nonsense about women's intuition. And she thought the promise of a steak dinner was adequate compensation. The nerve of her.  
而美里所谓的“作战计划”也颇具特色，充满了大胆无耻的乐观主义。她告诉他们，当使徒开始坠落时，要跑到预计的撞击地点，用手拦截。还有那关于女性直觉的胡言乱语。她竟然认为一顿牛排晚餐就能作为足够的补偿。真是厚颜无耻。

But even that didn't make her feel that uneasy. She knew that no matter how strong the Angel was, victory would be hers in the end. This day would end with her proving herself as a savior of humanity once again. She already knew that. The Angel's absurd strength would only add to Asuka's glory in defeating it.  
但即便如此，她并未感到不安。她深知，无论使徒多么强大，最终胜利必将属于她。这一天将以她再次证明自己是人类的救世主而告终。她早已心知肚明。使徒那荒谬的力量只会增添明日香击败它时的荣耀。

If anything, she should be eager for the fight. So far, Asuka only had one solo kill, in the volcano, and she would have died there if it wasn't for Shinji. Today was an opportunity to truly prove her worth.  
如果说有什么不同，她应该渴望这场战斗。迄今为止，明日香仅有一次独自击杀，在那座火山中，若非真嗣，她早已丧命。今天，是真正证明她价值的机会。

Her superiority. 她的优越感。

Asuka couldn't avoid it anymore. She had to face it.  
明日香再也无法逃避了。她必须面对现实。

_About ten minutes ago. In the main hangar.  
大约十分钟前。在主机库。_

_"Harmonics all green. All numerics within the tolerable range."  
谐波全部正常。所有数值均在可接受范围内。_

_"No. 3 auxiliary hydraulic system output locked at 86%..."  
“3 号辅助液压系统输出锁定在 86%...”_

_Asuka closed her eyes and tapped her index finger on the control panel, ignoring the technical babbling in the background. Each movement of her fingers was met with resistance from the sticky LCL, as if she was swimming in a bowl of thick cream. The bruise on her wrist throbbed. The bruise that Shinji had made just that morning.  
明日香闭上眼睛，用食指轻敲控制面板，无视背景中的技术杂音。每一次手指的移动都受到 LCL 粘稠的阻力，仿佛在厚厚的奶油中游泳。她手腕上的瘀伤隐隐作痛，那是早上真嗣留下的痕迹。_

I hope he's gentler at night. _Asuka blushed at her own thoughts. It didn't matter either way. She would be the one on the attack tonight._  
希望他晚上能温柔些。明日香为自己的想法脸红。无论如何，今晚她将是主动出击的那一方。

_But then again, there was no telling whether or not Shinji would just passively sit back and take it. Come to think of it, it would be utterly boring if he did. Instead she found herself hoping that he would touch every inch of her body, even more than he did this morning. And this time, there would be no annoying plugsuit in their way...  
但话说回来，谁也说不准真嗣会不会只是被动地坐视不管。仔细想想，如果他真的那样，那该多无聊啊。相反，她发现自己希望他能触碰她身体的每一寸，甚至比今早还要多。而这一次，不会再有碍事的插入栓服挡在中间……_

_The sharpness of Akagi's voice over the radio made Asuka flinch hard. Driven by sudden panic that her daydream was reflected in some sort of externally observable metric - heart rate or body temperature or something equally stupid - she quickly pressed the speak button in the corner of the command yoke.  
律子在无线电中尖锐的声音让明日香猛地一缩。出于突如其来的恐慌，担心她的白日梦会以某种可观测的指标反映出来——心率或体温或其他同样愚蠢的东西——她迅速按下了控制杆角落里的通话按钮。_

_"I didn't do anything!" “我什么都没做！”_

_Akagi's gaze shifted sharply from one corner to the opposite. "What? I wasn't talking to you, Asuka." Then she frowned. "Is there something wrong? Any reasons why your sync rate is out of the norm?"  
赤木的目光从一角猛地转向对面。“什么？我刚才不是在跟你说话，明日香。”随后她皱起眉头。“有什么问题吗？为什么你的同步率异常？”_

Does orgasming-by-rubbing-against-a-boy's-thigh-for-the-first-time-in-my-life count? _Asuka stifled the rogue thought. "Not really."_  
第一次靠摩擦男孩的大腿达到高潮算吗？明日香压下了这个不合时宜的想法。“没什么。”

_"Shinji, Rei, how about you?"  
“真嗣，丽，你们呢？”_

_"Nothing, ma'am."  "没什么，女士。"_

_"Me neither." "我也没有。"_

_Akagi crossed her arms and shifted her gaze to one side. "What are the odds of it being an error on our end?"  
赤城交叉双臂，将目光移向一旁。“我们这边出错的几率有多大？”_

_"I don't think so." A man's voice replied, faint and almost unrecognizable.  
"我不这么认为。" 一个男人的声音回答道，微弱且几乎难以辨认。_

_"What do you mean you don't think so? What kind of an answer is that?"  
"你说的不这么认为是什么意思？这算什么回答？"_

_"I can't say more than that, Doctor. While it's true that there have been many instances of electronics malfunctioning since the blackout, and it's also true we are still discovering undetected failures in largely non-essential areas, it's quite unlikely that there was an undetected problem in a critical part like the launch program of the Evangelion. But I can't give you more than that at this stage."  
"我只能说这么多，医生。虽然自停电以来确实有许多电子设备故障的案例，而且我们也确实在非关键区域发现了许多未被检测到的故障，但在像 EVA 发射程序这样关键的部分出现未检测到的问题，可能性相当小。但在现阶段，我无法提供更多信息。"_

_The man's answer came rather quickly, without even a moment's delay, and his voice was so nonchalant that Asuka felt something akin to respect for the unknown tech. Unlike Misato, Akagi had always been a difficult woman to deal with to Asuka. To not cower in the face of such a woman's questioning was something Asuka found quite respectable. If only Shinji was a bit more like that.  
男人的回答来得相当迅速，几乎没有片刻迟疑，他的声音如此漫不经心，以至于明日香对这位不知名的技术人员产生了一种类似敬意的感觉。与美里不同，赤木律子一直是个让明日香难以应付的女人。面对这样一个女人的质问而不退缩，明日香觉得颇为可敬。要是真嗣能稍微像那样就好了。_

_"Can we reboot the system?"  
“我们能重启系统吗？”_

_"You mean the whole operating system? That'd be too tight. We have an ETA of..."  
“你是说整个操作系统？那太紧张了。我们预计到达时间是...”_

_"What's going on here?" Misato walked into the window and peered at the monitor Akagi was watching. "We need Evas up there. We're running out of time. What's the problem?"  
"这里发生了什么？" 美里走到窗边，盯着赤木律子正在看的监视器。"我们需要 EVA 上去。时间不多了。问题出在哪里？"_

_"The system doesn't seem to be working properly."  
"系统似乎运行不正常。"_

_"Why? What exactly is the problem?"  
"为什么？具体是什么问题？"_

_"Look at this. No, lower than that. You expect me to believe those numbers?"  
"看看这个。不，比那再低点。你指望我相信这些数字？"_

_Misto's eyes narrowed. Asuka could no longer sit still. "Misato, what's all the fuss about?"  
密斯特的眼睛眯了起来。明日香再也坐不住了。“美里，这到底是怎么回事？”_

_"Ms. Misato?" Shinji chimed in too.  
"美里小姐？" 真嗣也插话道。_

_Misato shook her head. "It's no big deal. You and Asuka's sync rates are much higher than usual. Must be a new record for both of you."  
美里摇了摇头。“没什么大不了的。你和明日香的同步率比平时高得多。对你们俩来说肯定是新纪录了。”_

_"New record my ass. It must be a fluke from an observation device failure. We'll have to check the system out as soon as the battle is -"  
“新纪录？见鬼去吧。这肯定是观测设备故障导致的意外。战斗一结束我们就得检查系统——”_

_Asuka quickly pressed the speak button, cutting Akagi off. "How high? Tell me!"  
明日香迅速按下通话按钮，打断了赤木。“有多高？告诉我！”_

_Misato squinted. "Let's see...yours is holding at seventy-four percent."  
美里眯起眼睛。“让我看看...你的同步率保持在七十四百分比。”_

_That was truly impressive. Asuka had been a pilot for most of her life and had done countless synchronization tests, but she'd never gotten anywhere near that number before. Her heart swelled in her chest, and then…  
这真是令人印象深刻。明日香几乎一生都在驾驶 EVA，进行了无数次同步测试，但她从未接近过这个数字。她的心在胸中膨胀，然后…_

_"And Shinji is... seventy-six percent? That's great! It's the first time you've ever passed Asuka, right? Congratulations!"  
“而真嗣是...七十六百分比？太棒了！这是你第一次超过明日香，对吧？恭喜你！”_

…_froze._ …僵住了。

After that, Misato had overridden Akagi's advice for system reconfiguration, sending all three Evangelions to the surface. Between positioning her Eva and also consciously avoiding thinking about the subject, Asuka still hadn't come to a conclusion about what to make of the incident. Shinji had tried to talk to her over the comm a few times, but she'd ignored him, pretending to not hear him.  
在那之后，美里无视了律子的系统重构建议，派遣所有三台 EVA 前往地面。在调整 EVA 位置的同时，阿斯卡也刻意避免去思考这个问题，关于那次事件的结论她仍未得出。真嗣几次试图通过通讯设备与她交谈，但她都置之不理，假装没听见。

She couldn't do what Akagi had done and simply dismiss it as a system failure. Unlike Akagi, Asuka knew better than anyone that both she and Shinji had something going on between them that might have affected their ability to pilot. She was fairly certain it was not a malfunction. The sensory feedback confirmed it. Everything was much clearer and more immediate than usual.  
她无法像律子那样简单地将之归咎于系统故障。与律子不同，阿斯卡比任何人都清楚，她和真嗣之间存在着某种可能影响他们驾驶能力的问题。她相当确信这不是故障。感官反馈证实了这一点。一切比平时更加清晰和直接。

Asuka bit her lip. Should she celebrate the growth and accomplishment of a boyfriend who, despite some frustrations here and there, had been making her genuinely happy lately? It sounded natural, but she found herself very reluctant to actually do so.  
明日香咬了咬嘴唇。她是否应该庆祝一个男友的成长和成就，尽管他偶尔会让她感到些许挫败，但最近确实让她感到由衷的快乐？这听起来很自然，但她发现自己非常不愿意这样做。

And what kind of accomplishment was that anyway? It was a meaningless number that had little to do with actual combat. And it was still within the margin of error.  
再说，那算什么成就呢？那只是一个与实际战斗无关的无意义数字。而且，它还在误差范围内。

_Oh, but he's got a better record in actual combat, too.  
哦，不过他在实际战斗中的记录也更好。_

The thought pierced Asuka's heart like a cold needle. Whether in a solo fight or a joint effort, Shinji almost always took the most important role, and Asuka was…  
这个念头如同一根冰冷的针，刺痛了明日香的心。无论是单打独斗还是联手作战，真嗣几乎总是担任最关键的角色，而明日香则……

"Asuka! What the hell are you doing?! Go!"  
“明日香！你到底在干什么？！快去！”

Misato's screeching brought Asuka to her senses. The outline of her HUD was flashing red. Launch time +5 seconds. She turned to look toward the city proper. The tags marking the target's estimated drop zone and the positions of the other two Evas were all moving dizzily across the skyline. Asuka gritted her teeth and pressed the power plug ejection button.  
美里尖锐的喊声让明日香回过神来。她的 HUD 轮廓正闪烁着红色。发射时间 +5 秒。她转头望向市区。标记着目标预计坠落区域和其他两台 EVA 位置的标签，在天际线上疯狂移动。明日香咬紧牙关，按下了电源插头弹射按钮。

A weight disappeared from her back with a roar. Asuka sprinted forward. Before the detached plug could even hit the ground, Unit-02 had already stretched its long legs to leap over the elevated section of Tokyo-3's outer circuit road.  
随着一声轰鸣，她背上的重担消失了。明日香疾驰向前。在脱落的插头还未触地之前，二号机已经伸展其修长的双腿，跃过了第三新东京市外环路的隆起部分。

Following the recommended route overlaid on the HUD over the four-lane roads ahead, Asuka ran. Her joints were more responsive, the feel of asphalt and concrete crunching beneath her feet clearer, the sensation of wind on her face sharper than ever.  
沿着 HUD 上显示的推荐路线，明日香在四车道的道路上奔跑。她的关节反应更加灵敏，脚下沥青和混凝土的碎裂声更加清晰，迎面而来的风也从未如此锐利。

"Asuka might be late!" Akagi's annoyed voice boomed over the speaker.  
“明日香可能要迟到了！”赤城那恼怒的声音在扬声器中轰然响起。

"It's fine, at least for now. The drop zone was farther away from her than the other two anyway. Unit-01 would've still been there first even if she started right on time."  
"没事，至少目前是这样。空投区本来就比其他两个离她更远。即使她准时出发，零一机也还是会先到那儿。"

Asuka felt her face heat up at Misato's words, and when she looked, sure enough, the circle marking the estimated drop zone was rapidly shrinking, centered on a forlorn hill slightly to the north of Tokyo-3, and the tag labeled EVA-UNIT01 was approaching on a collision course with the tag labeled TARGET, the latter still unable to be seen through the clouds. She couldn't see both Unit-01 and Unit-00 other than their HUD tags from this angle, but judging by the distance marker, even Unit-00 would arrive at the target faster than Asuka.  
听到美里的话，明日香感到脸颊发烫，她一看，果然，标记着预计空投区的圆圈正迅速缩小，以东京-3 北部一座孤零零的小山为中心，而标记为 EVA-UNIT01 的标签正朝着标记为 TARGET 的标签直线逼近，后者仍被云层遮挡无法看见。从这个角度，她除了 HUD 标签外看不到零一机和零零机，但根据距离标记判断，即使是零零机也会比明日香更快到达目标。

Asuka snarled. It came out as more of a moaning growl. She stopped in her tracks and used the inertia of her run to pivot her body halfway. The pathfinder flickered and disappeared, and a warning sign popped up on the center of her HUD. Ignoring it, Asuka leaped over the two-story wooden houses that lined the side of the road. She didn't jump high enough, and her foot snapped the electric wires that hung loose between the poles and crushed the entire second floor of the house she passed as if it was a sandcastle.  
明日香咆哮了一声，听起来更像是一声呻吟般的低吼。她猛地停下脚步，利用奔跑的惯性半转身子。导航光标闪烁后消失，她的 HUD 中央弹出一个警告标志。明日香无视警告，跃过沿路排列的两层木屋。她跳得不够高，一脚踢断了悬挂在电线杆间的电线，并如同摧毁沙堡一般碾碎了她经过的房屋的整个二楼。

Landing with deep footprints in the backyard of the unlucky house, Asuka resumed her sprint, kicking away several cars parked on the street. For a moment, Asuka wondered what would become of the owners; no sane insurance company would offer coverage for this city. But then her attention was drawn back to the suggestion line that had now been redrawn to match her altered path. It was now telling her to go around a city block to reach the now-miniscule estimated drop zone circle.  
在不幸的房屋后院留下深深的脚印后，明日香继续疾跑，踢飞了街上停放的几辆车。有那么一刻，明日香想知道这些车主的命运；没有哪家理智的保险公司会为这座城市提供保险。但随后她的注意力被重新绘制的建议路线吸引，现在它指示她绕过一个街区以到达现已缩小的预计降落区圆圈。

"Asuka, we've set up a springboard at the D6 intersection, use it to go over to block C and-"  
"“明日香，我们在 D6 路口设置了弹跳板，用它跳到 C 街区，然后——”

Glancing at the navigator, Asuka launched herself into a low-rise store building before Misato could finish her sentence. Despite the slight stiffness in her arms, the Evangelion crashed straight through the five-story building without too much trouble and emerged onto the other side in a cloud of thick concrete dust. Broken steel bars and debris rained down in all directions, smashing parked cars, utility poles, and the windows of the neighboring buildings.  
瞥了一眼导航员，明日香在美里话音未落之际便冲向了一栋低矮的商店建筑。尽管手臂略显僵硬，但这位福音战士毫不费力地穿透了五层楼高的建筑，从另一侧破尘而出，扬起浓重的混凝土尘埃。断裂的钢筋和碎片如雨般四散，砸毁了停着的车辆、电线杆以及邻近建筑的窗户。

The new path, once again calculated by the built-in computer, was relatively straight. Asuka snorted, creating bubbles of air that floated in the LCL, and resumed her sprint.  
内置计算机重新计算的路径相对笔直。明日香哼了一声，在 LCL 中制造出漂浮的气泡，随即继续疾跑。

"Asuka! You keep disobeying-"  
"“明日香！你总是违抗命令——”

"TARGET INBOUND!" "目标接近！"

Someone's urgent shout interrupted Misato, raising the alarm. But it was an unnecessary announcement for Asuka. She didn't need to hear the report from the command center to know the Angel had arrived, nor did she need to see the autofocus on her HUD blink as it locked onto a spot in the clouds overhead. Before all of that, she _felt_ it.  
某人急促的呼喊打断了美里，拉响了警报。但对明日香来说，这通报并不必要。她无需从指挥中心得知使徒的到来，也不需要看到 HUD 上的自动对焦在头顶的云层中锁定目标时闪烁。在此之前，她已经感受到了。

The pressure. The pressure that felt like the whole sky was falling down on her and crushing her. It made it hard to breathe, let alone move. An alien, bizarre cacophony echoed in her head and resonated through her entire body. In the midst of the mind-numbing confusion and overwhelming sense of despair, Asuka gritted her teeth and fought not to lose consciousness.  
那股压迫感。仿佛整个天空都在向她压下，要将她碾碎。这让她难以呼吸，更不用说移动了。一种异样的、怪异的嘈杂声在她脑海中回响，传遍全身。在令人麻木的混乱和绝望感中，明日香咬紧牙关，努力不让自己失去意识。

As she continued to run forward on pure inertia, her sight began to darken. For a moment Asuka wondered if her vision was really failing her, and how powerful an AT-field would have to be to achieve that. Red flashing from the HUD caught her eyes. Overhead, high above.  
她继续凭借着纯粹的惯性向前奔跑，视线开始变得昏暗。有那么一刻，明日香怀疑自己的视力是否真的在衰退，以及需要多么强大的 AT 力场才能达到这种效果。HUD 上红色的闪烁吸引了她的目光。头顶上方，高高的天空。

Asuka had no words to describe the form that broke through the clouds. The most she could come up with was that it was like a flower from an alien planet that had been tugged from side to side, stretching it to its limits. Its body was a kaleidoscopic rainbow of fluorescent hues that flickered and changed at random, like an insane chameleon on a rampage.  
明日香找不到任何词语来形容那突破云层的形态。她最多能想到的是，它像是一朵来自外星的奇异花朵，被从两侧拉扯，拉伸到了极限。它的身体是一道五彩斑斓的霓虹色，闪烁变化无常，就像一只疯狂的变色龙在肆虐。

And it was huge. Asuka had battled the creatures called Angels several times already, but this entity was overwhelming, even for her. Its glowing bulk filled the sky. It wasn't that Asuka's sight was failing, but rather that the creature's body had blocked the sun and cast a shadow over the entirety of Tokyo-3.  
而且它巨大无比。明日香已经多次与被称为使徒的生物战斗，但这个实体对她来说仍然压倒性强。它发光的庞大身躯占据了整个天空。并非明日香的视力在衰退，而是这个生物的身体遮挡了太阳，为整个第三新东京市投下了阴影。

For the first time since she started to pilot the Evangelion, Asuka felt small. The Evangelion, the pinnacle of modern human science, a so-called multipurpose humanoid decisive weapon, was nothing more than an ant in the presence of the Angel of the sky. Vermin. Inconsequential. So small as to not even be worthy of contempt. Her Eva was no different from the houses and cars, roads and utility poles that Asuka had smashed without much effort or even any particular malice.  
自从她开始驾驶 EVA 以来，这是第一次，明日香感到自己如此渺小。EVA，现代人类科技的巅峰之作，所谓的多功能人形决战兵器，在天之使徒面前不过是一只蚂蚁。微不足道的存在。渺小到连被轻视的资格都没有。她的 EVA 与那些她轻易摧毁的房屋、汽车、道路和电线杆并无二致，既无多少努力，也无特别恶意。

And they were supposed to stop it with their bare hands. What a joke. Forgetting that the fight hadn't even begun yet, forgetting that she still had a duty to fulfill, Asuka looked up at the sky in a kind of daze that bordered on awe.  
而他们竟要用双手去阻止它。多么荒谬的笑话。忘记了战斗尚未开始，忘记了她还有职责未尽，明日香带着近乎敬畏的恍惚仰望天空。

"Unit-01, deploying AT-field!"  
“初号机，展开 AT 力场！”

A boy's stern shout over the comm jolted her out of it, giving her direction and reawakening her resolve. Asuka reflexively closed her eyes and 'stretched' her consciousness.  
一个男孩通过通讯的严厉呼喊将她从恍惚中惊醒，给予了她方向并重新点燃了她的决心。明日香本能地闭上眼睛，‘伸展’她的意识。

The AT-field, cranked up to its maximum limit, blew cars, utility poles, storefronts, windows, and everything else in the surrounding area in all directions except for the firmly rooted buildings themselves. The acrid stench ozone overwhelmed Asuka's nostrils. At the same time, the pressure on her body and the cacophony in her head were neatly swept away, never to be felt again. Once again, Unit-02's entry plug became Asuka's little safe zone.  
AT 力场被调至极限，将周围的汽车、电线杆、店面、窗户以及所有其他物体向四面八方吹飞，除了那些坚固的建筑物本身。臭氧的刺鼻气味充斥着明日香的鼻腔。与此同时，她身体上的压力和脑海中的喧嚣被彻底扫除，再也不会感受到。又一次，二号机的插入栓成为了明日香小小的安全区。

Now that her head was clear, she looked to the drop zone. Sure enough, there was an Evangelion alone atop the hill in front of her. The target was falling directly on top of it. Asuka thought it wasn't moving very fast, but the HUD's distance marker was testifying in real time that the remaining distance between the target and Unit-01 was shrinking at a dizzying speed. Cursing herself for wasting precious time, Asuka launched into a furious sprint.  
现在头脑清醒了，她望向降落区。果然，在她面前的小山上孤零零地站着一台 EVA。目标正直接坠向它。明日香觉得它下落得并不快，但 HUD 上的距离标记实时证明，目标与初号机之间的剩余距离正在以令人眩晕的速度缩短。明日香咒骂自己浪费了宝贵的时间，随即发起了疯狂的冲刺。

Unit-01 raised its arms. Her fellow pilot, her companion, her boy, perhaps her man, if things went that way tonight, stood alone and strong against the falling sky as if declaring he could hold the entirety of heaven on his shoulders, like Atlas of old.  
初号机举起双臂。她的同伴驾驶员，她的伙伴，她的男孩，或许今晚将成为她的男人，独自一人，坚强地面对着坠落的天空，仿佛在宣告他能够像古老的阿特拉斯那样，肩负起整个天堂。

Her _man._ Yes. Asuka planned to allow that today. The fact that she hadn't outright said it was a purely nominal compromise for the benefit of the part of her that was still hesitating, that was still feeling disgusted, that was still too proud. But she had no illusions about how things would go tonight when it was just the two of them alone in their apartment, away from prying eyes. It was just like when she told him she would pretend to date him. A flimsy excuse, used as a launching point and made to be forgotten once it had served its purpose. For a moment, Asuka wondered why she had to have it that way.  
她的男人。是的。明日香计划今天允许这一点。她没有直接说出口，纯粹是为了照顾内心仍在犹豫、感到厌恶、过于骄傲的那部分自己而做出的名义上的妥协。但她对今晚当他们俩独自在公寓里，远离窥探的目光时事情会如何发展没有幻想。这就像她告诉他她会假装和他约会一样。一个脆弱的借口，被用作起点，一旦达到目的就会被遗忘。有那么一刻，明日香想知道为什么她必须以这种方式行事。

The next thing that crossed her mind was self-loathing. Disgust at the fact that she was thinking about such things even now, in the heat of the battle. So stupid. She had a duty to perform, a life-or-death situation to maneuver through, and her mind was preoccupied with a boy. Shamelessly thinking of giving him her body and her heart. A cold voice in the back of Asuka's mind scolded her mercilessly.  
紧接着涌上心头的是自我厌恶。即使在战斗的紧要关头，她还在想着这些事情，这让她感到恶心。太愚蠢了。她有职责要履行，有生死攸关的局面要应对，而她的心思却全在一个男孩身上。无耻地想着把自己的身体和心都交给他。在明日香内心深处，一个冷酷的声音无情地斥责着她。

Even these feelings were ones Asuka was used to by now. They had ingrained themselves into her modus operandi these days. First she would tell herself to slow things down, and then, inevitably, she would find herself almost desperately trying to figure out how to drag Shinji into doing something neither of them had done before. And then she would become terrified that the only thing he really wanted from her was her body, and finally she'd become angry if he didn't seem enthusiastic enough, and let that anger drive her to try to push the boundaries ever further. It was a manic cycle that she herself couldn't keep track of.  
即使这些情感，明日香如今也已习以为常。它们已经深深植入了她的日常行为模式。起初她会告诉自己要放慢节奏，然后，不可避免地，她会发现自己几乎绝望地试图想办法让真嗣去做一些他们从未做过的事情。接着她会害怕他真正想要的只是她的身体，最后如果他表现得不够热情，她会变得愤怒，并让这种愤怒驱使她不断尝试突破界限。这是一个她自己都无法掌控的狂乱循环。

_But,_ whispered another voice, _you like it when he does things to you._ And she did. She liked the things he did so much that she said stuff to Shinji that she never imagined saying to any boy. She genuinely wanted him to keep doing things to her, and badly at that. But that argument felt weaker somehow, weaker than it did when she was looking up into Shinji's hard face this morning, pinned and helpless beneath him.  
但，另一个声音低语道，你喜欢他对你做的事。她的确如此。她喜欢他做的那些事，以至于对真嗣说出了她从未想象过会对任何男孩说的话。她真心希望他继续对她做那些事，而且非常迫切。但不知为何，这个论点显得有些无力，比不上今早她仰望着真嗣坚毅的面庞，被他牢牢压制、无助时的那种感觉。

Why? Because she was not facing Shinji now? Sitting alone behind the walls of the entry plug and the AT-field? Because the fever of the morning had finally worn off and the cold reality had set in? But what kind of reality was that?  
为什么？是因为她现在没有面对真嗣吗？独自坐在插入栓和 AT 力场的壁垒之后？是因为早晨的热度终于消退，冰冷的现实已经降临？但那又是什么样的现实呢？

An ear-splitting blast of sound interrupted Asuka's thoughts. Even with the plug's built-in volume control and the distortion of the LCL, the shockwave threatened to burst Asuka's eardrums and her balance. It shattered the surrounding windows as if to prove its power. Asuka instinctively raised her hands to cover her face. The falling debris and shards peppered Unit-02's armor plates. She had passed through showers of debris many times before, but never had her senses been sharp enough to feel every tiny shard on her arms and shoulders. Asuka once again realized that her synchro rate was much higher than usual.  
一声震耳欲聋的巨响打断了明日香的思绪。即便有插入栓内置的音量控制和 LCL 的扭曲，冲击波仍似要震破明日香的耳膜，扰乱她的平衡。它击碎了周围的窗户，仿佛在证明自己的威力。明日香本能地举起双手护住脸庞。坠落的碎片和玻璃渣纷纷落在二号机的装甲板上。她曾多次穿越碎片雨，但从未像现在这样，感官敏锐到能感受到每一小块碎片落在手臂和肩上。明日香再次意识到，她的同步率远超平常。

Asuka looked up to find the source of the impact. It was Unit-01, pushing back the falling Angel with its AT-field, literally catching the falling sky with its own hands. Everything went dark, and on the hilltop where the two fields were in conflict, vegetation, houses, and pretty much everything else other than the Angel and Evangelion Unit-01 were burned to ash. Asuka's HUD picked up Unit-00's arrival from the opposite slope, invisible from this angle.  
明日香抬头寻找冲击的来源。是初号机，用 AT 力场顶住了坠落的天使，用双手实实在在地托住了天空。一切陷入黑暗，在两股力场冲突的山顶，除了天使和初号机，植被、房屋以及几乎所有其他东西都化为了灰烬。明日香的 HUD 显示零号机从对面山坡抵达，从这个角度看不见。

As she witnessed the sight, Asuka instinctively realized what was happening in front of her was also the answer to the question she had just asked herself. The cold reality that she wasn't on that hilltop. That someone else was standing there instead. Standing taller than her. Doing something mightier than what she was doing. Something more important. Something heroic.  
当她目睹这一幕时，明日香本能地意识到眼前发生的一切，也正是她刚刚自问的答案。那冷酷的现实告诉她，她并未站在那山顶。而是有另一个人站在那里。比她站得更高。做着比她更伟大的事情。更为重要。更为英勇。

"Friendly AT-fields collapsing! We're getting overwhelmed!"  
友军的 AT 力场正在崩溃！我们快要撑不住了！

"Sensory feedback to Unit-01 has crossed the danger threshold! We should put a force cap on synchro _now_ or-"  
零一机的感官反馈已超过危险阈值！我们应该立即限制同步率，否则——

"Pointless. Unit-01 itself would be destroyed before anything serious happens to the pilot. We should -"  
"毫无意义。在驾驶员受到严重伤害之前，初号机本身就会被摧毁。我们应该——"

_"Asuka!"_ Shinji called out - no, _screamed,_ cutting through Akagi's cold voice. He was looking for her. He _needed_ her.  
"明日香！" 真嗣喊道——不，是尖叫，打断了律子的冷漠声音。他在寻找她。他需要她。

"Second! Quick!" "第二！快！"

There was a sense of urgency even in the First's voice.  
就连初号机的声音中也透着一股紧迫感。

"I'm almost there, stop nagging me!"  
“我快到了，别再催我了！”

Pulling a knife from her shoulder pylon, Asuka sprinted up the hill. The frustration that had been building in her chest, compounded by the ever-increasing pressure as she neared the Angel, became unbearable. A guttural scream erupted from her mouth as she charged towards the gap in the AT-field that Unit-00 managed to make through desperate neutralization.  
从肩部装甲中抽出一把刀，明日香飞奔上山。随着她越来越接近使徒，胸中积压的挫败感与不断增加的压力变得难以忍受。她发出一声低沉的嘶吼，冲向零号机拼尽全力中和出的 AT 力场缺口。

---

Shinji wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand and instantly shuddered in pain. He really, really shouldn't have done that. Especially considering why he was sweating in the first place.  
真嗣用手背擦去额头的汗水，立刻痛得打了个寒颤。他真的，真的不该这么做。尤其是考虑到他为什么会出汗的缘故。

"Doctor Akagi won't like this," he muttered, looking down at the bandages on his desk.  
“赤木博士不会喜欢这样的，”他喃喃自语，低头看着桌上的绷带。

In the immediate aftermath of the battle, Shinji had almost been afraid to look at his arms. They throbbed and ached like they had been shattered in a thousand places. But when he'd used them to keep his balance on the way out of the entry plug, they appeared just as they always had, all the bones right where they should be. When she saw him wincing in pain, Dr. Akagi applied compression bandages down their lengths and sent him on his merry way.  
战斗刚结束时，真嗣几乎不敢看自己的手臂。它们像是在千百处碎裂般抽痛。但当他用它们保持从插入栓出来的平衡时，手臂看起来和往常一样，所有的骨头都完好无损。当赤木博士看到他痛苦地皱眉时，便沿着手臂长度缠上了压迫绷带，然后让他离开了。

The first thing he did when he got home was feed Penpen with his throbbing hand, then shove him inside his little refrigerator and lock him inside. Then he prepared to take a shower and got reminded of the bandages on his arms. It had been easy enough to keep up with Dr. Akagi's instructions while sitting in the infirmary, but between the pain and exhaustion and numerous other thoughts that had been swirling through his brain, he'd forgotten what she'd said about reapplying them. He sighed. He'd tried several times already with no luck. He probably wouldn't be able to get them back on until his checkup at HQ tomorrow.  
一回到家，他首先用那只疼痛的手给 Penpen 喂食，然后将它塞进小冰箱里并锁上。接着，他准备洗个澡，却想起了手臂上的绷带。在医务室里，按照赤城医生的指示行事还算容易，但疼痛、疲惫以及脑海中纷乱的思绪让他忘记了她关于重新包扎的叮嘱。他叹了口气，已经尝试过几次都没成功，大概要等到明天总部复查时才能重新包扎了。

But he had no choice. He had to wash himself. He showered back at the headquarters after the battle, but that had been about ten hours ago now, and he'd been through the whole tiring process of first aid, waiting, debriefing, waiting yet again, then finally a dinner trip to Gotemba and a car ride home. He couldn't say he was perfectly clean now. So, despite the fact that his hands and arms were screaming and tears were welling up in his eyes, Shinji brushed his teeth and washed his entire body with hot water, taking special care of his nethers, pulling all the way down and scrubbing until the sensitive flesh underneath was tingling. He even rubbed his finger there and sniffed at it after drying himself to make sure he was clean. Not washing was unthinkable given what was about to happen tonight.  
但他别无选择，必须清洗自己。战斗结束后，他在总部洗过澡，但那已是十小时前的事了，之后他经历了急救、等待、汇报、再次等待，最终去御殿场吃了晚饭并乘车回家。他不能说自己现在完全干净了。因此，尽管双手和手臂疼痛难忍，泪水在眼眶中打转，真嗣还是刷了牙，用热水彻底清洗了全身，特别注意清洁私处，一直拉到底并用力搓洗，直到敏感的肌肤感到刺痛。他甚至用手指揉搓那里，擦干后闻了闻，确保干净。考虑到今晚即将发生的事情，不洗澡是不可想象的。

Judging by the faint sound of water coming from the bathroom, Asuka must have been thinking the same.  
从浴室传来的微弱水声判断，明日香想必也在想着同样的事情。

Though Asuka never explicitly told him to wash or anything. It was just him assuming things. Because, after the battle, Shinji had consciously avoided her.  
虽然明日香从未明确告诉他要洗澡或其他什么。这只是他自己的猜测。因为，战斗结束后，真嗣有意避开了她。

And that was a natural thing. It would be awkward to look her in the face after being given such a wicked promise. He'd had no problem with that in the morning, sure, but he was half-insane back then. Now that the battle was over and the excitement had subsided, the reality of what was to follow was beginning to sink in. Every time he looked at Asuka's face, his own burned and he couldn't calm down as his mind replayed what he had done to her that morning and what was about to happen that night.  
而这一切都是自然而然的。在得到如此邪恶的承诺后，直视她的脸会显得尴尬。早上他对此毫无问题，确实，但那时他几乎疯了。现在战斗结束了，兴奋感消退，即将发生的事情的现实开始逐渐渗透。每次他看着明日香的脸，自己的脸就发烫，无法平静下来，脑海中不断回放早上对她所做的事以及即将在今晚发生的事情。

She said she would pay him back. In what way, though? With her hand? Or...in other ways? Like... her mouth? And in what position? And would she be wearing clothes? And how many times?  
她说她会偿还他。但以什么方式呢？用手吗？还是...其他方式？比如...用嘴？而且是什么姿势？她会穿衣服吗？还要多少次？

Various images he had seen in pornographic magazines flashed through his mind, but instead of the models, he imagined himself and Asuka in those positions. Lying side by side, or Shinji on top of her, or Asuka on top of him, or her kneeling in front of him.  
他曾在色情杂志上看到的各种画面在脑海中闪现，但这次他想象的是自己和明日香处于那些姿势中。并排躺着，或者真嗣在她上面，或者明日香在他上面，或者她跪在他面前。

The towel wrapped around his lower body bulged. The fact that he hadn't put on fresh clothes was another testament to the kind of expectations Shinji had for tonight.  
围在他下身的毛巾鼓了起来。他没有换上干净衣服，这再次证明了真嗣对今晚的期待有多么不同寻常。

_Is she imagining the same things I am right now? How far is she willing to go?  
她是否也在想象我现在所想的事情？她愿意走多远？_

He had no chance to ask about that, either. They avoided each other, but there was also the matter of listening ears all around them. At headquarters, in the hangar, in the infirmary, in the briefing room, in the car, and during the dinner itself. Shinji barely had a chance to speak to Asuka at the restaurant Misato took them to even if he could have thought of anything to say, because Ms. Misato was glued to his side, cutting his steak for him since he was injured.  
他也没有机会问这个问题。他们彼此回避，但周围还有许多耳朵在听。在总部，在机库，在医务室，在简报室，在车上，甚至在晚餐时。真嗣几乎没有机会在美里带他们去的餐厅里与明日香说话，即使他能想到要说什么，因为美里小姐一直粘在他身边，帮他切牛排，因为他受伤了。

It was such a hectic day that Shinji even forgot to inform Misato of his newly acquired information that Ayanami hated meat. Ayanami almost didn't follow them to dinner because of that. Misato had to practically beg her, saying every steak place has pasta on their menu so there would be something she could eat.  
那天忙得不可开交，真嗣甚至忘了告诉美里他新得知的消息——绫波讨厌吃肉。就因为这个，绫波差点没跟他们一起去吃晚饭。美里几乎是在恳求她，说每家牛排店菜单上都有意面，总会有她能吃的。

Asuka must have been just as preoccupied and embarrassed as Shinji was. Even when Shinji spoke to her in an attempt to cheer her up just before their Evas launched, she acted as if she hadn't heard him. In the locker room after the battle, when Shinji shyly thanked her for coming in time to save the day, she merely nodded with a wry smile. At dinner, Asuka let Misato sit next to Shinji, choosing to sit across from him, and when Misato puffed out her chest excitedly and formally praised the pilots one by one right before the food was served, Asuka simply nodded and didn't respond when it was her turn.  
明日香肯定也和真嗣一样心烦意乱又尴尬。即使真嗣在他们的 EVA 启动前试图和她说话来让她振作，她也表现得好像没听见。战斗结束后在更衣室里，当真嗣腼腆地感谢她及时赶到拯救了局面时，她只是苦笑着点了点头。晚餐时，明日香让美里坐在真嗣旁边，自己则选择坐在他对面。当美里兴奋地挺起胸膛，在食物上桌前正式地逐一表扬驾驶员时，轮到明日香时，她只是点了点头，没有回应。

After the meal, Misato had to go straight back to HQ, so the pilots returned to their home by Section-2 vehicles, and Shinji and Asuka were split up into separate cars, as convoy policy dictated that no more than one pilot could be in a single vehicle. That drive ended up taking several hours because the road back home was still clogged with people coming back now that the battle was done. He arrived home first.  
饭后，美里必须直接返回总部，于是驾驶员们乘坐第二支部提供的车辆回家，真嗣和明日香被分到了不同的车上，因为护送政策规定每辆车不得超过一名驾驶员。这段路程花了好几个小时，因为战斗结束后，返家的人群仍然堵塞着道路。他先到家。

If that was the end of it, Shinji would have been paralyzed with anxiety by now, but he wasn't. Earlier, when Shinji had just gotten out of the shower, Asuka had arrived and was entering the kitchen hallway. When she saw him naked save for the towel wrapped around his waist, she blushed slightly.  
如果事情就此结束，真嗣此刻恐怕早已焦虑得动弹不得，但他并没有。早些时候，真嗣刚洗完澡，明日香就到了，正走进厨房过道。看到他只围着一条浴巾，她微微脸红。

"I should wash too, right?" she muttered, and went straight into the bathroom. That was the last time they talked.  
“我也该洗个澡，对吧？”她低声自语，径直走进了浴室。那是他们最后一次交谈。

Asuka had no intention of backing down. Shinji was sure of it.  
明日香丝毫没有退让的意思。真嗣对此确信无疑。

Then, Shinji realized that he couldn't hear the sound of water anymore. When did it end? Did that mean she was done with her shower? He had no way to tell, and it didn't matter anyway. He hurriedly stood up, his chair flying back, and slammed his erect penis against the bottom side of the desk, making a heavy thud. Shinji couldn't even scream as he writhed in unspeakable pain and collapsed onto the desk. The towel tied around his waist came undone and pooled around his feet.  
接着，真嗣意识到他再也听不到水声了。什么时候停的？这是否意味着她已经洗完澡了？他无从得知，反正也无所谓。他急忙站起身，椅子向后飞去，坚挺的阴茎猛地撞在桌底，发出沉重的声响。真嗣痛得无法出声，只能在难以言喻的痛苦中扭动，瘫倒在桌上。围在腰间的毛巾松脱开来，堆积在他的脚边。

Fearing that Asuka might hear him and come looking, Shinji forced his numb legs to move and scurried to his feet, grabbing the towel and wrapping it around his waist again. He couldn't let her see this pathetic show. He feared he might have made a bruise down there. He prayed for a more merciful ending for his little friend when all was said and done today.  
担心明日香可能听到动静过来查看，真嗣强迫自己麻木的双腿动起来，匆忙站起，抓起毛巾重新围在腰间。他不能让她看到这副可怜相。他担心那里可能已经淤青了。他祈祷今天一切结束后，他的小伙伴能得到一个更仁慈的结局。

The hallway outside was a little cooler than his room. The door to Asuka's room was closed and there was no sign of her. Looking toward the living room, where all the lights were out and darkness had fallen, Shinji steeled his resolve. His heart felt like it was going to burst. Feeling more nervous than he did when he was alone on that hilltop with the Angel's terror descending on him, Shinji began to walk. Slowly. Carefully.  
走廊外的温度比他的房间稍低一些。明日香的房门紧闭，不见她的踪影。望向客厅，那里灯火全熄，一片漆黑，真嗣鼓起勇气。他的心脏仿佛要跳出来。比起独自一人在山顶面对天使的恐怖降临，此刻的他更加紧张，真嗣开始缓缓前行。小心翼翼。

As he expected, Asuka was in the kitchen. Standing with her back to him, facing the sink, a cup in her hand. Her hair, clipped up as usual, was spilling over a towel that barely reached her shoulder blades.  
正如他所料，明日香在厨房里。背对着他，面朝水槽，手中握着一只杯子。她的头发一如既往地用发夹束起，披散在勉强触及肩胛骨的毛巾上。

And that was the only thing she wore. It barely reached her thighs. The droplets of water on her bare shoulders and slender legs glistened blue in the moonlight streaming in from the living room. Shinji's crotch twitched. He swallowed with a dry throat.  
而那便是她身上唯一的衣物。长度仅及大腿。月光从客厅洒入，她裸露的肩膀和纤细双腿上的水珠在月光下泛着蓝光。真嗣的下体微微一动。他干咽了一口。

Asuka bowed her head slightly, then dropped the cup into the sink. She slowly turned back to Shinji. She must have sensed his presence.  
明日香微微低头，随即将杯子丢进水槽。她缓缓转回身面对真嗣。她一定是察觉到了他的存在。

As Shinji stood still, at a loss for words, Asuka tilted her head slightly and said nothing. An awkward silence fell briefly, then was broken by Asuka.  
真嗣呆立原地，无言以对，明日香稍稍侧头，一言不发。一阵尴尬的沉默短暂降临，随即被明日香打破。

"Where's the penguin? I don't see him."  
“企鹅呢？我没看见它。”

"I locked him in his fridge. He kept bugging me, so I thought he might bug us when we started to, to, to do it."  
“我把他在冰箱里锁住了。他一直烦我，所以我想他可能会在我们开始，开始，开始做那事的时候来烦我们。”

Asuka chewed her lip. Then her lips formed something resembling a smile. "Quite a planner, huh?"  
明日香咬了咬嘴唇。然后她的嘴角露出一丝近似微笑的表情。“真是个计划周详的家伙，嗯？”

Shinji nodded curtly and took a step toward Asuka. Her eyes, glowing black in the moonlight, fluttered. Her gaze darted quickly between Shinji's lower body and his eyes. Shinji's eyes also kept falling on Asuka's cleavage, visible through the towel, so he forced himself to shift his gaze to the other side, to the A-10 neural clips above her head.  
真嗣简短地点了点头，向明日香迈了一步。她的眼睛在月光下闪烁着黑色的光芒，微微颤动。她的目光迅速地在真嗣的下半身和他的眼睛之间游移。真嗣的目光也不由自主地落在明日香透过毛巾显露的乳沟上，于是他强迫自己将视线移开，转向她头顶上的 A-10 神经夹。

"You didn't wash your hair, Asuka."  
"你没洗头发，明日香。"

"I washed it once at the headquarters. I'd usually wash it again at home, but…" Asuka's voice was barely above a whisper. She slowly ran a hand through her hair. "It takes forever to dry. So you'd have to wait. You don't want that, do you?"  
"我在总部洗过一次了。通常回家还会再洗一次，但是……" 明日香的声音几乎细不可闻。她缓缓地用手梳理着头发。"要干透得花很长时间。所以你得等。你不想那样，对吧？"

There was a trace of that low, husky seductive tone in Asuka's voice that Shinji had grown accustomed to by now. It was very small, barely more than a whisper compared to the usual, but it was enough to push Shinji to the limit of his patience. Shaking his head, he took another step toward her, and now they were within hugging distance.  
明日香的声音里带着一丝低沉而诱人的音调，这是真嗣如今已经习惯的。虽然很微弱，比起平时几乎只是耳语，但足以让真嗣的耐心到达极限。他摇了摇头，又向她迈进一步，现在他们已经近到可以拥抱的距离了。

Asuka reached out first, cautiously, to grasp Shinji's shoulders. Her touch was stingingly hot against his bare skin, making him flinch and gasp shakily. In the next moment, he'd crushed Asuka to himself and they were kissing. Her mouth fluttered open under his. It tasted of water and toothpaste. The burning pain in his arms, the feeling of her breasts against his bare chest, the throbbing of his crotch squeezed between them - none of it was as important as the wetness of Asuka's lips, the softness of her swirling tongue, the searing heat rising from deep in her throat.  
明日香首先伸出手，小心翼翼地抓住真嗣的肩膀。她的触碰在他赤裸的皮肤上灼热得刺痛，让他不由得颤抖着倒吸一口气。下一刻，他已将明日香紧紧拥入怀中，两人开始亲吻。她的嘴唇在他的触碰下微微张开，尝起来有水的清新和牙膏的薄荷味。手臂上的灼痛感，她胸部紧贴着他赤裸胸膛的感觉，以及被夹在他们之间的下体悸动——这一切都不及明日香唇瓣的湿润，她旋转的舌尖的柔软，以及从她喉咙深处升腾起的炽热。

Asuka broke the kiss first and inhaled sharply. When she opened her mouth her voice was breathy and high-pitched. The sound of it made Shinji's head dizzy and his lower body unbearably stiff. "Have you been waiting for me? Did you wait for me all along?"  
明日香率先结束了亲吻，深吸了一口气。当她开口时，声音轻柔而高亢。这声音让真嗣感到头晕目眩，下体也变得难以忍受地僵硬。“你一直在等我吗？你一直都在等我吗？”

_You have no idea,_ Shinji wanted to say. He wanted to tell her that he'd been waiting for this moment more desperately than he waited for her on that hill today. No, he had been waiting for this moment since he'd met her on that sunny day on the aircraft carrier. No, he'd been waiting for this his whole life.  
你无法想象，真嗣想这么说。他想告诉她，他等待这一刻的渴望比今天在山坡上等她时还要迫切。不，自从在那艘航空母舰上阳光明媚的日子里遇见她以来，他就在等待这一刻。不，他一生都在等待这一刻。

But as always, eloquence was not Shinji's strong suit. He couldn't even get those words out of his mouth, let alone say them without stuttering or sounding stupid. Instead, he did what he had imagined countless times in his head today. Holding onto Asuka's waist as tightly as his throbbing, weak hands allowed, Shinji tilted his head and leaned toward her. Asuka closed her eyes and tilted her head too, probably anticipating a kiss, but Shinji passed her lips and kissed her neck instead.  
但一如既往，口才是真嗣的弱项。他连这些话都说不出口，更别提不结巴或不显得愚蠢了。相反，他做了今天在脑海中想象过无数次的事情。他紧紧抓住明日香的腰，尽他那颤抖无力的双手所能，真嗣侧过头，向她靠近。明日香闭上眼睛，也侧过头，大概是期待一个吻，但真嗣却越过了她的唇，转而在她的脖颈上落下一吻。

He moved slowly. Asuka gasped in surprise as he gently sucked the sharp line of her jawbone. Then he drew his tongue down the long slender length of her neck, savoring the soap-clean taste of it, the sound of her whimpers, the way her breathing hitched and became faster. When he nibbled her nape with his lips, Asuka moaned, her fingers tangling in his hair and digging into the back of his neck, pulling him closer, closer.  
他动作缓慢。当真嗣轻轻吮吸她尖锐的下颌线时，明日香惊讶地倒吸一口气。然后他沿着她修长纤细的脖颈，用舌头缓缓滑下，品味着那沐浴露般清新的味道，她的呜咽声，以及她呼吸变得急促、断断续续的方式。当他用唇轻咬她的后颈时，明日香呻吟着，手指缠绕在他的发间，深深陷入他的后颈，将他拉得更近，更近。

Shinji lifted his head to check on her. She was looking down at him, her lips slightly parted. Her face was bright red, noticeable even in the dim moonlight. And it wasn't just her face; her whole body was flushed. The heat radiating from the both of them made him feel like he was standing naked under the sun at noon. He looked down at her cleavage. It glistened. Shinji wasn't sure if it was leftover from the shower or fresh sweat.  
真嗣抬起头来查看她的状况。她正低头看着他，双唇微张。她的脸颊在昏暗的月光下依然红润夺目。不仅仅是脸颊；她的全身都泛着红晕。两人散发的热量让他感觉仿佛正赤身裸体地站在正午的阳光下。他低头看向她的胸口。那里闪着光泽。真嗣不确定那是沐浴后的残留还是新出的汗水。

But there was something else that caught his eye. Something dark pink and hard sticking out from just above the towel.  
但还有别的东西吸引了他的目光。从毛巾上方露出的，是深粉色的坚硬物体。

The moment he finally realized what he was seeing, Asuka noticed where he was looking and stiffly raised her hands to cover her chest. Shinji's hands came up reflexively and clasped around hers.  
当他终于意识到自己看到了什么时，明日香注意到了他的视线，僵硬地抬起手来遮住胸口。真嗣的手本能地抬起，紧紧握住了她的手。

They exchanged a wordless glance as their hands remained interlocked. Her gaze was shaky.  
他们交换了一个无声的眼神，双手依旧紧紧相扣。她的目光有些动摇。

Asuka eventually gave a small nod. Shinji slowly let go of Asuka's hands and carefully hooked his fingers between her breasts and the towel, pulling it down. It slid down to her waist without much resistance. There was still a knot that kept it from coming fully undone, but he wasn't noticing it now.  
明日香最终轻轻点了点头。真嗣缓缓松开明日香的手，小心翼翼地将手指钩在她胸前的毛巾和胸部之间，轻轻拉下。毛巾顺势滑落到她的腰间，几乎没有遇到什么阻力。尽管还有一个结让它没有完全散开，但他此刻并未注意到。

It was a little embarrassing to admit, but women's breasts weren't totally uncharted territory for Shinji; they were all over the TV after ten o'clock at night, and he had glimpsed enough of them in porno magazines. He'd even touched Ayanami's before, albeit accidentally.  
虽然有点不好意思承认，但女性的胸部对真嗣来说并非完全陌生；深夜十点后的电视上随处可见，他也在色情杂志中瞥见过不少。他甚至曾经不小心触碰过绫波的胸部。

But what lay before him now was unlike anything Shinji had ever seen. Asuka's breasts were better than he could have imagined. They were beautiful, small yet round and finely shaped, crowned with little pink nipples. He swallowed. He wanted to know what kind of noise she'd make if he put his mouth on them. They were perfect. Her whole body was perfect, really, gleaming under the moonlight, looking for all the world like an ancient marble statue of a goddess. Her torso was slim. Her waist pinched sharply. Long and slender legs. Slightly muscled arms. Flat belly. But most of all, what was truly, unbearably wonderful was the fact that its owner wanted to show it to Shinji. Was willingly giving it to him.  
但眼前的一切却是真嗣前所未见的。明日香的胸部比他想象的还要美好。它们美丽、小巧却圆润，精致的顶端点缀着粉嫩的乳头。他咽了咽口水。他想知道如果他用嘴触碰它们，她会发出什么样的声音。它们完美无瑕。她的整个身体也是如此，在月光下闪耀着光芒，宛如一尊古老的大理石女神雕像。她的躯干纤细。腰肢紧致。修长而苗条的双腿。略带肌肉的手臂。平坦的小腹。但最重要的是，真正令人难以忍受的美好之处在于，它的主人愿意向真嗣展示这一切。她心甘情愿地给予了他。

Shinji tried to reach out, but Asuka took a step back, grabbed his chin with one hand and lifted his face up, forcing him to look into her eyes.  
真嗣试图伸出手，但明日香后退了一步，用一只手抓住他的下巴，抬起他的脸，强迫他直视她的眼睛。

"Show me yours, too. It's only fair."  
“也让我看看你的。这才公平。”

"O-okay." "好-好吧。"

With uncooperative fingers, Shinji untied his towel and slowly lowered it. Asuka's gaze was blatantly fixed on his organ. Shinji fidgeted, fighting the instinctive urge to cover himself. It was so hard to keep standing straight and…  
手指笨拙地不听使唤，真嗣解开了毛巾，缓缓地将其放下。明日香的目光直勾勾地盯着他的下体。真嗣局促不安，强忍着本能想要遮掩自己的冲动。要保持站直真是太难了……

Asuka burst out laughing, abruptly, and loudly. It wasn't a giggle or a chuckle, but full-blown, thigh-beating laughter.  
明日香突然爆发出大笑，突如其来且响亮。这不是轻笑或浅笑，而是彻底的、拍打着大腿的大笑。

Shinji froze at the unexpected reaction. Was it really that funny? Or... small? Shinji's face burned with shame and tears started to fill his eyes. He fought a sudden, visceral urge to turn around and run back to his room.  
真嗣被这突如其来的反应吓得僵住了。真的有那么好笑吗？还是说...太小了？真嗣的脸颊因羞愧而发烫，泪水开始在眼眶中打转。他强忍着一股突如其来的本能冲动，想要转身跑回自己的房间。

"Asuka, why are you laughing..."  
“明日香，你为什么笑...”

Asuka hastily raised a hand to cover her mouth. Her shoulders were hunched, but even as she giggled her gaze was still fixed on the place it had been earlier. Her eyes were brimming with tears.  
明日香急忙抬起手捂住嘴。她的肩膀耸起，尽管在咯咯笑，目光却依旧停留在之前的位置。她的眼眶中盈满了泪水。

"Idiot Shinji! I'm not in the mood, so stop it! I'm warning you! Oh my god, I'm going to lose my mind..."  
"笨蛋真嗣！我没心情，别闹了！我警告你！天啊，我要疯了..."

"Asuka, _you_ stop that! I'm not doing anything!"  
"明日香，你住手！我什么都没做！"

Asuka pointed at Shinji's crotch. "You're wiggling it! Stop...please..."  
明日香指着真嗣的胯部。 "你在抖它！停下来...求你了..."

"What?" Shinji looked down. "Th-that's not what I'm doing! It has a mind of its own, it moves on its own! That's just the way it is..."  
"什么？" 真嗣低头看去。"不，不是我故意的！它有自己的意识，自己会动！事情就是这样..."

Asuka finally stopped laughing after a few deep breaths. She wiped the hand that had been covering her mouth on the towel still tied around her waist. She gazed at him for a few seconds.  
明日香终于在几次深呼吸后停止了笑声。她用原本捂着嘴的手在仍系在腰间的毛巾上擦了擦。她盯着他看了几秒钟。

"It's so ugly." "真是丑死了。"

Shinji groaned. A mischievous look appeared on Asuka's face.  
真嗣呻吟了一声。惣流脸上露出了调皮的表情。

"Probably the only ugly part of your body."  
“大概是你身上唯一丑的部分吧。”

Shinji blinked, utterly dumbfounded.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，完全愣住了。

"...I'll take that as a compliment."  
"...我会把这当作一种赞美。"

Humming thoughtfully, Asuka took a step closer, her tongue lightly licking her upper lip, a hand squeezing her breast, her eyes narrowed. It was a calculated gesture, designed to evoke a certain reaction from him, and Shinji knew it, but he couldn't help but feel a rush of excitement that threatened to drive him insane.  
沉思地哼着曲子，明日香向前迈了一步，她的舌头轻轻舔过上唇，一只手紧握着她的胸部，眼睛眯了起来。这是一个精心设计的动作，旨在引发他的某种反应，而真嗣知道这一点，但他还是忍不住感到一阵兴奋，几乎要让他疯狂。

"Now it's my turn, I guess? What do you say, handsome?"  
"现在轮到我了，对吧？你怎么说，帅哥？"

Despite the overly confident words, there was a noticeable tremor in her voice. There was also a subtle gleam in her eyes as she stared intently into Shinji's. It was clear this was a line she had rehearsed hundreds of times. As clueless as he was, Shinji still could see through it. He realized that just as he had rehearsed this situation in his mind over and over again, so had Asuka, and how important and nerve-wracking this was for her. That fact, more than anything else, made Shinji feel grateful and excited.  
尽管言辞过于自信，她的声音中却明显带着颤抖。她凝视着真嗣的眼睛，目光中闪烁着微妙的光芒。显然，这句话她已经排练了无数次。尽管真嗣对此一无所知，他依然能看穿这一切。他意识到，正如自己一遍遍在心中预演这个场景一样，明日香也是如此，这对她来说是多么重要且紧张。这个事实，比其他任何事都更让真嗣感到感激和兴奋。

Asuka bit her lip. "Come on. What position do you want me - "  
明日香咬了咬嘴唇。“来吧。你想让我做什么——”

Later, Shinji wouldn't be able to recall what exactly happened next, so overwhelmed was he with lust. He remembered pulling her roughly to himself and kissing her, but that was it. Amidst all the moans and body heat and tangled limbs and tongues and grunts he found himself on top of her, Asuka lying on the floor and him untying the towel from around her waist.  
后来，真嗣无法确切回忆起接下来发生了什么，他被欲望彻底淹没。他只记得粗暴地将她拉向自己并亲吻她，仅此而已。在所有的呻吟、体温、纠缠的四肢、舌头和喘息声中，他发现自己压在她身上，明日香躺在地板上，而他正在解开她腰间的毛巾。

Shinji leaned over now completely naked Asuka, cupping her breast with one hand. Softness filled his hand, something totally different from what he'd felt over the plugsuit this morning, and he felt her hard nipple poking between his fingers. His dick throbbed. Only a great effort of will prevented him from cumming right then and there.  
真嗣俯身在完全赤裸的明日香身上，一只手托着她的乳房。手中的柔软与今早在插入栓服上感受到的截然不同，他能感觉到她坚硬的乳头在他指间突起。他的下体悸动着。只有极大的意志力才阻止了他当场射精。

Asuka pushed his shoulders away, raising her upper body. "Wait."  
明日香推开他的肩膀，上半身抬起。"等等。"

"Huh?" Shinji's voice was so hoarse it surprised him.  
"啊？" 真嗣的声音沙哑得连他自己都吃了一惊。

"We promised I'd do it. This is different."  
“我们承诺过我会做的。这不一样。”

It took Shinji a moment to realize what she was saying. And she was right. Whatever Shinji was about to do before Asuka stopped him, it was a far cry from the promise they'd made this morning.  
真嗣花了片刻才明白她在说什么。而她的确是对的。无论真嗣之前打算做什么，被明日香阻止之前，那都与他们今早的承诺相去甚远。

But what exactly was he trying to do?  
但他究竟试图做什么呢？

He realized the answer the moment he asked himself the question. And it terrified him. He questioned his reasoning. He questioned if he was being too greedy and pushy. Maybe he should back off for now and restrain himself once again.  
他意识到答案的那一刻，自己也被吓到了。他质疑自己的推理，怀疑自己是否过于贪婪和咄咄逼人。或许他现在应该退一步，再次克制自己。

But then again, when dealing with Asuka, the answer to such thoughts was always no.  
但话说回来，面对明日香时，这样的想法总是被否定的。

So Shinji grabbed Asuka's knees and opened his mouth.  
于是，真嗣抓住了明日香的膝盖，张开了嘴。

"Asuka... you don't want to do it?"  
“明日香...你不想做吗？”

Asuka's eyes fluttered. A silence fell. Shinji stroked his thumbs gently across her knees to calm his nerves, wondering if this was the one time he'd crossed a line he shouldn't have.  
明日香的眼帘微微颤动。一阵沉默降临。真嗣用拇指轻轻抚摸着她的膝盖，试图平复自己的紧张情绪，不知道这是否是他不该逾越的那一次。

She slowly spread her legs. Shinji was utterly frozen by the sight before him. For a long time he forgot to breathe.  
她缓缓地分开双腿。真嗣被眼前的景象彻底定住了。有好一会儿，他忘记了呼吸。

Wispy strands of hair that were the same shade of copper as the ones on her head. Asuka's lips, which didn't resemble anything Shinji had imagined, glistened slightly in the moonlight. Something watery was coating them, pooling slightly at the base and dripping over. Utterly obsessed with the thought of what would happen if he licked it all up, and what she would do if he did so, and what she would taste like, Shinji flinched at the sudden sound of her voice.  
几缕发丝轻飘飘地垂落，与她头顶的铜红色如出一辙。明日香的双唇，与真嗣所想象的截然不同，在月光下微微闪耀。某种湿润的东西覆盖其上，稍稍汇聚于唇缘，缓缓滴落。真嗣完全沉浸在若他舔去这一切会发生什么的幻想中，她会有何反应，以及她会是什么味道，直到她的声音突然响起，他才猛地一惊。

"Stop teasing me and do it if you're really going to do it."  
“别再逗我了，要真打算做就做吧。”

Asuka's voice was noticeably shaking now. Shinji swallowed hard. Instinctively, his hand reached down and grabbed his cock. Asuka grabbed his shoulder with one hand and wrapped her legs around his waist. There was no misinterpreting that gesture. He leaned in and squeezed Asuka's breast again with his free hand, pinching her nipple between his fingers. A moan escaped her mouth.  
明日香的声音明显在颤抖。真嗣艰难地咽了口唾沫。本能驱使下，他的手向下探去，握住了自己的阴茎。明日香一手抓住他的肩膀，双腿缠绕在他的腰间。这一举动再明显不过。他倾身向前，空着的那只手再次捏住明日香的乳房，用手指夹住她的乳头。她发出了一声呻吟。

_Center the target, pull the switch,_ he thought, and shook his head to dismiss it. The motion seemed to dislodge something that had been stuck inside his head, and he realized that there was something he wanted to say, something he felt like he should say now or lose the chance forever.  
瞄准目标，拉动开关，他想着，然后摇了摇头试图驱散这个念头。这个动作似乎摇落了脑海中某个卡住的东西，他意识到有些话想说，有些感觉像是现在不说就会永远失去机会。

"Asuka... there's something I want to tell you."  
“明日香...我有件事想告诉你。”

Asuka's whole attention was fixated on their groins, so close to touching, so she reacted to his words belatedly. Uneasy, wide eyes looked up into Shinji's.  
明日香全神贯注地盯着他们几乎要碰触到的胯部，所以她对他说的话反应迟缓。不安的、睁大的眼睛望向了真嗣。

"...Yeah?" "...嗯？"

Slowly. Carefully. Shinji had no illusions about his eloquence, so he took utter caution and checked the words that were in his head thrice before moving them to his mouth.  
慢慢地。小心翼翼地。真嗣对自己的口才没有幻想，所以他极其谨慎，将脑海中的话语反复检查了三遍，才将它们说出口。

"Asuka. Today, before the battle. There was a moment when I and Ms. Misato were alone. She asked me then, why do I pilot Eva, why do I do this whole NERV thing, why do I fight."  
"明日香。今天，战斗前。我和美里小姐独处的片刻，她问我，为什么我要驾驶 EVA，为什么要参与 NERV 的一切，为什么要战斗。"

Asuka's lips parted slightly, but no words came out of them. Shinji's gaze was drawn to those moist, glistening pink lips, and he felt the urge to kiss them again, but he resisted it, knowing he still had more to say.  
明日香的双唇微微张开，却未吐露一言。真嗣的目光不由自主地被那湿润闪亮的粉唇吸引，他感到再次亲吻它们的冲动，但他忍住了，知道还有更多话要说。

"I realized that I couldn't answer any of those questions. Maybe I was just doing this because the adults around me told me to, without even knowing why."  
“我意识到我无法回答那些问题。也许我只是因为周围的大人告诉我这么做，却连为什么都不知道。”

Asuka smiled wryly. "Are you an idiot?"  
明日香苦笑道：“你是个傻瓜吗？”

With that, Asuka reached up and brushed Shinji's bangs out of his face. Shinji leaned into her soft palm and smiled.  
说完，明日香伸手将真嗣的刘海拂开。真嗣轻轻靠在她柔软的掌心，微笑着。

"For a while, I think I piloted Eva because I wanted my dad's approval. Even if I didn't want to admit it to myself or to anyone. But...  
有一段时间，我想我驾驶 Eva 是因为我想要得到父亲的认可。即使我不愿向自己或任何人承认这一点。但是...

"I realized today that I don't care about any of those things anymore. That I don't feel strong emotions at Father's words either way."  
今天我意识到，我不再在乎那些事情了。无论是父亲的话，我都不再有强烈的情感波动。

"Then...what are you fighting for, if not for your dad's praise anymore?"  
"那么...如果不是为了得到父亲的赞许，你又在为什么而战斗呢？"

Shinji took a deep breath. Now was the most important part. The reason he'd stopped at the precipice of becoming a man. The truth he wanted to tell. The confession.  
真嗣深吸了一口气。现在是至关重要的部分。他之所以在成为一个男人的边缘停下脚步的原因。他想说出的真相。他的告白。

"You. Asuka. Your face, your eyes, your heart, as I see them now."  
"你。明日香。你的脸庞，你的眼睛，你的心灵，正如我现在所见。"

Asuka blinked, speechless. The fingers that had been stroking Shinji's cheeks stopped moving, too. Then they moved to the back of his head, pulling him closer. Shinji followed her lead and leaned in to kiss her. It was a breathy, gentle kiss, one mouth pulling the other back in the moment it veered even a little too far away. After a time, they finally broke apart. A sticky thread of spit ran between them, then broke off to fall down on Asuka's chin. Her eyes were full of tears as she let out a chuckle. "Idiot."  
明日香眨了眨眼，无言以对。原本轻抚着真嗣脸颊的手指也停了下来，随后移至他的脑后，将他拉近。真嗣跟随她的引导，倾身吻了她。这是一个轻柔而急促的吻，当一方的唇稍稍偏离，另一方便将其拉回。片刻后，他们终于分开。一条黏腻的唾液丝在他们之间延伸，随即断开，落在明日香的下巴上。她的眼中盈满泪水，轻笑出声：“笨蛋。”

"But it's the truth, Asuka. Do you remember when he called after the battle and complimented me? I don't remember ever hearing words like that from him before. It would have made me so happy, but right then all I could think of was you, Asuka. Even while he was rambling over the phone about how well I did today, I was thinking about you and our promise. It was the same at dinner. Ms. Misato called me the hero of this operation. It didn't make me feel bad, but it didn't matter to me in the slightest either. I was looking at your face, Asuka, because none of that matters to me. Sync rate, my father, being a hero, whatever. None of it."  
“但那是真的，明日香。你记得战斗结束后他打电话来夸奖我吗？我以前从没听他说过那样的话。那本会让我非常开心，但那时我满脑子都是你，明日香。即使他在电话那头喋喋不休地谈论我今天表现得有多好，我心里想的却是你和我们之间的承诺。晚餐时也一样。美里小姐称我为这次行动的英雄。这并没有让我感到不快，但对我来说也毫无意义。我一直在看着你的脸，明日香，因为那些对我来说都不重要。同步率，我的父亲，成为英雄，无论什么。这些我都不在乎。”

The atmosphere immediately cooled down several degrees. Shinji clamped his mouth shut, an icy hand seizing his heart. Asuka's legs around his waist, her hand on his shoulder, her face looking at him, they were not the same. She was tense beneath him. Rigid. Unyielding.  
气氛立刻下降了几度。真嗣紧闭双唇，一颗冰冷的手攥住了他的心脏。明日香的双腿环绕在他的腰间，她的手搭在他的肩膀上，她的脸看着他，这一切都不一样了。她在他身下紧绷着。僵硬。毫不屈服。

"...Asuka?" "...明日香？"

Asuka turned away from Shinji's gaze, her expression suddenly cold and remote. "But it's true."  
明日香避开了真嗣的目光，她的表情突然变得冷漠而疏远。"但那是真的。"

"What? What's true?" “什么？什么是真的？”

"That you're the hero, Shinji."  
"你是英雄，真嗣。"

Shinji remained silent, unable to comprehend what Asuka meant by that. Asuka turned her watery eyes back to Shinji. Those eyes that had been so full of warmth just moments ago now held pain and something far more poisonous.  
真嗣沉默不语，无法理解明日香此言何意。明日香转过泪眼，再次望向真嗣。那双片刻前还充满温情的眼眸，此刻却满是痛苦与某种更为致命的东西。

"You say you don't need those things, that they're meaningless, but you don't realize that even your denial is meaningless too. Because even if I was gone from your life, those things would still be true. They're undeniable. You'd be the hero no matter _what._"  
"你说你不需要那些东西，它们毫无意义，但你没意识到，你的否认同样毫无意义。因为即便我离开了你的生活，那些事实依然存在。它们无可否认。无论怎样，你都会是英雄。"

At the sudden coldness in her voice, Shinji felt his entire body freeze. He couldn't understand what was happening.  
她声音中突如其来的冷意让真嗣全身僵硬。他不明白发生了什么。

"Asuka, I don't understand..."  
“明日香，我不明白……”

Asuka sighed, pushing Shinji's hand away from her chest, unwrapping her legs from his waist, and beginning to rise. "Of course you don't understand."  
明日香叹了口气，推开真嗣放在她胸前的手，松开缠在他腰间的双腿，开始起身。“你当然不明白。”

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

Without answering, Asuka headed for the bedroom hallway. She didn't even spare him a backward glance. He soon heard the sliding door open and shut with a muted rasp. Shinji was left alone in the kitchen, hunched over awkwardly among a mess of towels. His body suddenly felt cold. His cock, which had gone limp in his hand, oozed thick liquid from the tip, as if crying.  
未作回答，明日香径直走向卧室走廊，连回头看他一眼都未曾。他随即听到滑动门轻柔地开启又合上。真嗣独自留在厨房，尴尬地蜷缩在一堆凌乱的毛巾中。他的身体忽然感到一阵寒意。手中的阴茎已然疲软，顶端却渗出浓稠液体，仿佛在哭泣。

### Chapter 16 You first

It was well after Shinji had fallen asleep when Asuka came to him. He was completely exhausted from tossing and turning for hours, his mind roiling, so he barely noticed it when Asuka gently shook his shoulder. When he didn't react, Asuka called his name.  
夜已深沉，真嗣早已陷入梦乡，而明日香才悄然来到他身边。他因数小时的辗转反侧而筋疲力尽，思绪翻涌，以至于明日香轻摇他肩膀时，他几乎未曾察觉。见他毫无反应，明日香轻声呼唤他的名字。

"Shinji. Are you sleeping?"  
"真嗣，你睡着了吗？"

Shinji groaned briefly, still in a daze, then hurriedly sat up, making Asuka flinch. She took a step back.  
真嗣含糊地咕哝了一声，仍处于半梦半醒之间，随即急忙坐起身来，让明日香不禁退缩了一下。她向后退了一步。

Then it was Shinji's turn to flinch. Asuka's body, gleaming under the moonlight, was as bare as the last time he'd seen it in the kitchen. He gasped, his pants bulging instantly.  
接着轮到真嗣退缩了。明日香的身体在月光下闪闪发光，就像上次在厨房里看到的那样一丝不挂。他倒吸一口气，裤裆立刻鼓了起来。

"Asuka...?" “明日香...？”

Asuka frowned slightly and looked down at him, clearly annoyed.  
明日香微微皱眉，低头看着他，显然有些不悦。

"What are you all dressed up for?"  
“你们这是穿得这么正式干嘛？”

"I, I don't sleep naked..."  
“我，我不裸睡的……”

"Me neither." “我也是。”

_What's she getting at?_ Shinji tried not to let the frown appear on his face. Was she trying to tell him that he shouldn't have been sleeping? That he should have just been lying there, naked and waiting for her?  
她在暗示什么？真嗣努力不让眉头皱起。难道她在告诉他，他不该睡着？他应该只是光着身子躺在那里，等着她？

He swallowed hard. There was usually only one reason why a girl would enter a boy's room buck naked in the middle of the night. The primitive part of his brain momentarily forgot the frustration and resentment that had been boiling all night as he imagined Asuka slipping into bed with him, her warm body pressing against his, the feeling of her breasts -  
他艰难地咽了口唾沫。通常情况下，女孩半夜一丝不挂地进入男孩的房间只有一个原因。他原始的大脑暂时忘记了整晚沸腾的挫败感和怨恨，想象着明日香滑进他的被窝，她温暖的身躯紧贴着他，感受着她的胸部——

Shinji forced his eyes up away from Asuka's chest and tried to study her face instead. Asuka frowned and leaned back slightly, wrapping her arm around her chest. The angle of it pushed her breasts together, creating a deep line of cleavage that he found utterly mesmerizing. It was amazing how much power a girl could have over a boy with just one simple gesture, Shinji mused. It was like magic or something.  
真嗣强迫自己将目光从明日香的胸前移开，试图专心观察她的脸。明日香皱起眉头，微微后仰，用一只手臂环抱住胸部。这个角度使得她的双峰更加突出，形成了一道深深的乳沟，让他完全着迷。真嗣暗自思忖，一个女孩仅凭一个简单的动作就能对男孩产生如此大的影响力，真是不可思议。这简直就像是魔法一样。

The thought made something twist bitterly inside him. Maybe that was the point. Maybe she wanted him to look. Maybe she wanted the satisfaction of seeing him want her, even after all she'd done. Shinji shut his eyes and took a deep breath.  
这个念头在他心中激起了一阵苦涩的扭曲感。或许这就是关键所在。也许她就是想让他看。也许她想要看到他在她所做的一切之后仍然渴望她，以此获得满足感。真嗣闭上眼睛，深吸了一口气。

"Asuka, why are you here...?"  
“明日香，你为什么在这里...？”

Despite everything, there was still a hint of anticipation in his voice. Shame brought heat to his cheeks.  
尽管如此，他的声音中仍带着一丝期待。羞愧让他的脸颊发烫。

Asuka averted her gaze, her face visibly flushed. Shinji's wild suspicion solidified into a certainty. Neither of them said anything for a few moments.  
明日香移开了视线，她的脸明显泛红。真嗣的疯狂猜疑凝固成确信。他们俩一时无言。

"...Asuka?" “……明日香？”

Asuka closed her eyes tightly and sighed. She took a step toward Shinji, then bent at the waist, placing both hands on each of his knees. Their faces were close, close enough for a kiss. Shinji reflexively pulled away. Asuka chewed her bottom lip for a moment before finally opening her mouth.  
明日香紧紧闭上眼睛，叹了口气。她向真嗣迈出一步，然后弯下腰，双手分别放在他的两个膝盖上。他们的脸靠得很近，近到足以接吻。真嗣本能地向后缩了缩。明日香咬了咬下唇，片刻后终于开口。

"Our promise." “我们的约定。”

Her words, grudging though they sounded, were exactly what he had been hoping for. While he was left speechless, his excitement surging, Asuka continued, as if she were explaining herself further, as if she needed to convince herself.  
尽管她的语气听起来有些不情愿，但这些话正是他所期待的。他激动得说不出话来，而明日香继续说着，仿佛在进一步解释自己，仿佛她需要说服自己。

"No matter what, I hate being owed something. I want to make sure this thing between us is settled before the sun comes up. Or..."  
"无论如何，我讨厌欠人东西。我想在天亮之前确保我们之间的事有个了结。或者……"

"Or...?" "或者……？"

"Or...we might need to talk."  
"或者……我们可能需要谈谈。"

This was a rare instance in which he knew exactly what she meant. But his mind was full of doubts. He wasn't sure what to make of what happened in the kitchen. Or what to say to Asuka.  
这是一个罕见的时刻，他完全明白她的意思。但他的心中充满了疑虑。他不确定该如何理解厨房里发生的事情，也不知道该对明日香说些什么。

_Liar,_ a small voice muttered in Shinji's mind. _You have a literal mountain of things you want to say to her._  
骗子，一个微小的声音在真嗣的脑海中低语。你有一大堆话想对她说。

And that was closer to the truth. He wanted to ask her if she was punishing him because he surpassed her for once. If she hated the fact that his sync rate was higher than hers, even if it wasn't by much. If she hated the fact Ms. Misato praised him to the point that she was able to so callously discard the confession that had weighed so heavily on the point she had to ruin what was supposed to be the most special day between them.  
这更接近真相。他想问她是否因为自己这次超越了她而惩罚他。是否她讨厌他的同步率比她高，哪怕只是略高一点。是否她讨厌美里小姐对他的夸赞到了让她能如此冷酷地抛弃那个沉重告白的程度，以至于她不得不毁掉本应是他们之间最特别的一天。

Anger aside, Shinji knew he shouldn't say those things. No, just thinking about them made him feel guilty. Asuka must have had her reasons for acting the way she did. It was her right to decide what to do with her body, and she had the right to refuse to do anything she didn't want to. Her attitude was a little inconsiderate, but in the end, Shinji shouldn't be angry about her refusal.  
抛开愤怒不谈，真嗣知道他不该说出那些话。不，光是想到这些就让他感到内疚。明日香那样做一定有她的理由。她有权决定如何处置自己的身体，也有权拒绝任何她不愿意做的事。她的态度或许有些不顾他人感受，但归根结底，真嗣不该因为她拒绝而生气。

He shouldn't be angry, but he was. He couldn't explain it. Or maybe he didn't want to. Maybe he didn't want to face what that anger meant.  
他不该生气，但他确实生气了。他无法解释这种情绪，或许他根本就不想解释。也许他不想面对这愤怒背后意味着什么。

Why was he feeling guilty, anyway? If Shinji had done a similar thing to Asuka, would she have been timid and hesitant the way he was now? Wouldn't she be angry instead?  
话说回来，他为何感到内疚呢？如果真嗣对明日香做了类似的事，她会像他现在这样胆怯犹豫吗？她会不会反而感到愤怒呢？

_But she came to you._ Another voice in Shinji's mind spoke up in her defense. _Maybe this is her olive branch._  
但她来找你了。真嗣心中另一个声音为她辩护道。也许这是她的橄榄枝。

As Shinji was lost in thought, Asuka gently prodded Shinji. "...Shinji? What are you going to do now?"  
当真嗣陷入沉思时，明日香轻轻地戳了戳真嗣。“……真嗣？你现在打算怎么办？”

_Why are you asking me that?_ _You're the one who made this mess. You're the one who should be taking the lead now. Why is it always my fault?_  
你为什么要问我这个？是你把事情搞砸的。现在该由你来带头解决问题。为什么总是我的错？

And that made him realize that it might not be a good idea to talk with her right now. He'd probably say something he'd regret, and he would probably damage their relationship even more than it already had been.  
这让他意识到，现在和她交谈可能不是个好主意。他很可能会说出让自己后悔的话，而且可能会让他们的关系比现在更加恶化。

_Then what?_ Shinji looked into Asuka's eyes. She was staring at him a little uneasily. Her eyes were so beautiful, yet at the same time so cold. Remote. Mercurial. Incomprehensible.  
那又怎样？真嗣凝视着明日香的眼睛。她有些不安地盯着他。她的眼睛如此美丽，却又如此冷漠。遥远。多变。难以捉摸。

What should they do now?  
他们现在该怎么办？

Only after seeing her eyes flutter did Shinji realize he had reached out and placed his hands on her shoulders. The next moment, he was slowly but firmly pressing them down.  
直到看见她的眼睑微微颤动，真嗣才意识到自己已经伸出手，放在了她的肩上。下一刻，他缓缓而坚定地将它们压下。

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

_What am I doing? What do I want?_ As if answering those questions, Shinji's hands pushed the unresisting Asuka down, making her kneel between his legs.  
我在做什么？我想要什么？仿佛在回答这些问题，真嗣的双手将毫不反抗的明日香推倒，让她跪在自己的双腿之间。

Something sharp and hot flashed through Asuka's eyes as she looked up at Shinji, only to be replaced by shame and resignation.  
当明日香抬头看向真嗣时，她的眼中闪过一丝尖锐而炽热的光芒，随即被羞愧和屈服所取代。

"Yeah, honestly, I expected this."  
“是啊，老实说，我预料到了。”

An alarm went off in Shinji's head. Shinji wanted to tell her that she didn't have to do that, that he would never force her to do something uncomfortable for her. That he'd rather they do something uncomfortable for him, like talking. But the words wouldn't come out of his mouth. It was like his body wasn't cooperating with his head. Instead, when Asuka's fingers gripped the waistband of both his shorts and underwear and pulled them down together at once, Shinji lifted his ass slightly to help her.  
真嗣的脑海中警铃大作。他想告诉她，她不必这么做，他绝不会强迫她做任何让她感到不适的事。他宁愿他们做一些让他感到不适的事，比如交谈。但这些话就是说不出口。仿佛他的身体与他的头脑并不协调。相反，当明日香的指尖抓住他短裤和内裤的松紧带，同时将它们一起拉下时，真嗣微微抬起了臀部，帮助她完成动作。

His thing sprang stiffly to attention. A faint odor came out along with it. It was to be expected, given that it had been a few hours since he washed. It wasn't overpowering, or even especially strong, but it wasn't something he wanted Asuka to smell.  
他的那东西硬挺挺地立了起来。随之而来的是一丝淡淡的气味。这是可以预料的，毕竟他已经几个小时没有洗澡了。这气味并不浓烈，甚至不算特别强烈，但他并不希望明日香闻到。

Asuka wrinkled her nose. That finally woke him up, but it was too late to stop her now. Without any warning or foreshadowing or anything one might call a preliminary motion, Asuka took him in her mouth. It wasn't a quick lick or sucking at the tip, but all the way in, all the way to the root. Shinji shuddered, unable to say anything as the heat enveloped his member. It was hotter than anything he'd ever felt. And when Asuka's tongue, sharp and molten like a blade on fire, slid under his foreskin, he...  
明日香皱了皱鼻子。这一下终于让他醒了过来，但阻止她已经太迟了。没有任何预警或预示，也没有任何可以称之为预备动作的行为，明日香将他含入口中。这不是快速舔舐或仅吸吮顶端，而是深入到底，直达根部。真嗣颤抖着，无法言语，只感到一股前所未有的热度包裹着他的下体。这热度比他以往所感受到的任何事物都要强烈。而当明日香那如火焰般炽热且锋利的舌头滑过他的包皮时，他……

...woke up with a sharp gasp.  
……猛地惊醒，倒抽一口凉气。

The ache in his chest was overwhelming. Shinji lay still like a dead man for a while. He just wanted to curl up and go back to sleep again, but the rapidly cooling dampness of his underwear was becoming unbearable. An eternity later, he sat up. The liquid that his clothes failed to absorb began to drip downward. He limped to his desk, pulled out some tissues, and shoved his hand down there to do some quick cleanup. The sheer volume of spillage quickly made everything a sticky mess.  
胸口的疼痛难以忍受。真嗣像死人一样静静躺了一会儿。他只想蜷缩起来，再次入睡，但内裤迅速冷却的潮湿感变得难以忍受。仿佛过了一个世纪，他坐起身来。衣物未能吸收的液体开始向下滴落。他一瘸一拐地走到书桌前，抽出一些纸巾，伸手进去迅速清理。泄出的液体量之大，很快让一切都变得黏糊糊的。

As if on autopilot, his body absentmindedly moved to the closet and pulled out a new pair of underwear and pants with his clean hand. After all, this wasn't his first rodeo.  
仿佛自动驾驶一般，他的身体心不在焉地移向衣柜，用干净的那只手取出了一条新内裤和裤子。毕竟，这已经不是他第一次经历这种事了。

It was, however, his first wet dream after he started to masturbate. And it was also the most shameful and horrible dream his mind had ever conjured up.  
然而，这是他开始自慰后的第一次春梦。也是他脑海中构想过的最羞耻、最可怕的梦。

He should never have tossed aside the vigilance that had guided him throughout his entire life. Drunk on excitement, he had taken Asuka's words at face value and ignored his own misgivings. That so-called "permanent consent", that blanket permission for him to do whatever he wanted to her, was a lie.  
他本不该抛开那一生中指引他的警觉。沉醉于兴奋之中，他轻信了明日香的话，忽视了自己的疑虑。那所谓的“永久同意”，那张允许他随心所欲对待她的空头支票，不过是个谎言。

Shinji left the room, all the while trying to ignore the storm of self-loathing and shame in his chest. His feet stopped in front of the door to Asuka's room.  
真嗣离开了房间，努力忽视胸中翻涌的自厌与羞愧。他的脚步停在明日香房间的门前。

Should he go in and talk to her? The question froze him in place. He had a hunch that it wouldn't be a good idea to go back to sleep and let the night pass, heavy with all the things left unsaid between them. But then he remembered that he wasn't wearing pants. He was still clutching his soiled clothing in one hand.  
他应该进去和她谈谈吗？这个问题让他僵在原地。他有种预感，回去睡觉让这个充满未尽之言的夜晚过去，并不是个好主意。但随即他想起来自己没穿裤子。他仍用一只手紧抓着脏衣服。

He doubted Asuka would be as receptive to his nudity in real life as he was to hers in his dream.  
他怀疑明日香在现实中对他的裸体不会像他在梦中对她那样接受。

And that wasn't his only problem. Even once he cleaned up, what could he possibly do?  
而这并非他唯一的困扰。即便他整理好自己，他又能做些什么呢？

Conversation? Would he complain about his pain? That he resented her for throwing away his confession like that?  
交谈吗？他会抱怨自己的痛苦吗？怨恨她那样随意丢弃他的告白？

And if he somehow managed to resist the urge to complain, then what? Would he ask her why she left him there in the kitchen?  
如果他设法克制住抱怨的冲动，那又如何？他会问她为何将他留在厨房里吗？

Shinji knew he wouldn't get a straight answer out of her. He'd be lucky if she didn't completely explode. But he didn't even need to ask her, not really. He already knew. He'd come so close to going off on her about it in his dream.  
真嗣知道从她那里得不到直截了当的回答。如果她没有彻底爆发，他就算走运了。但其实他根本不需要问她，他心里早已有数。在梦里，他差点就因此对她大发雷霆。

It was their sync rate. Because the numbers had been slightly off before the battle. That miniscule, insignificant difference was still enough to upset her that much.  
是同步率的问题。因为在战斗前，那些数字稍稍偏离了正常值。那微不足道、无足轻重的差异，却足以让她如此心烦意乱。

It was ridiculous, if Shinji was being honest. To him, sync rates had no bearing on one's abilities as a pilot. In his opinion, he had never actually surpassed Asuka, not even once.  
如果真嗣坦诚地说，这很荒谬。对他而言，同步率与驾驶员的能力毫无关系。在他看来，他从未真正超越过明日香，一次也没有。

He still remembered the first time he sortied with her. How she'd flown between the battleships so effortlessly, as if she were dancing. He'd been so dizzy and disoriented after the second or third jump that he'd barely been able to think straight, let alone pay attention to the surrounding environment or the Angel, and all the while she was darting from ship to ship with such speed and precision. Even the slightest error would have sent them plummeting into the depths. Shinji would never be able to do that with his Unit-01. Hell, he wouldn't be able to do it with his own body. If they set up a swimming pool or something with floating stepping platforms and ordered him to jump between them, he would probably fall in. And Asuka managed to do it through the filter of Eva, with her senses and motor coordination dulled by the sync ratio.  
他依然记得自己第一次与她一同出击的情景。她如何在战舰间轻盈穿梭，仿佛在舞蹈一般。他在第二次或第三次跳跃后便已头晕目眩，几乎无法清晰思考，更别提留意周围环境或使徒了，而她却以惊人的速度和精准度在各舰间穿梭。哪怕最细微的失误都可能让他们坠入深渊。真嗣知道自己无论如何也无法用初号机做到这一点。哪怕是凭借自己的身体，他也做不到。如果他们设置一个泳池，上面漂浮着踏板，命令他在其间跳跃，他大概会掉进去。而明日香却能通过 EVA 的过滤，在感知与运动协调因同步率而迟钝的情况下做到这一切。

And then there was what he saw in their next fight. In their first sortie against the 7th Angel, Asuka had moved so swiftly, swinging her glaive and cutting the Angel in half. Her initial attack, misguided as it was, had managed to impress him nonetheless. He didn't think he could ever move as nimbly as Asuka did, or use such a cumbersome weapon half so well. When Shinji asked her how she did it, Asuka shrugged and explained that she had been trained in martial arts since she was very small.  
然后是他目睹的他们下一场战斗。在首次迎战第七使徒时，明日香动作迅捷，挥舞着她的长柄刀将使徒一分为二。尽管她的初次攻击方向有误，却依然让他印象深刻。他自认无法像明日香那样灵活移动，也无法如此娴熟地使用这样笨重的武器。当真嗣问她是怎么做到的，明日香耸耸肩，解释说她从小就开始接受武术训练。

How underwhelming and pathetic he was compared to her! He thought he could shoot reasonably well with the help of the built-in computer, and he used the knife for simple lunges and thrusting, but more complex weapons left him stumped. He had no prior experience with things like that, no training, no knowledge of martial arts. There were times when he still struggled with the basics. One example that immediately came to mind was his fight against the 9th Angel, where he had to operate completely blind because he forgot how to activate the radar module of Unit-01. With all of this taken into account, Shinji had never for a moment entertained the notion that he was a better pilot than Asuka.  
与她相比，他是多么的逊色和可悲！他以为在内置电脑的帮助下，自己射击还算过得去，用刀也只是简单的突刺和直刺，但更复杂的武器就让他束手无策了。他之前没有接触过这些，没有训练，不懂武术。有时他连基本功都还挣扎。立刻浮现在脑海中的例子就是他与第九使徒的战斗，因为忘记了如何激活零一机体的雷达模块，他只能完全盲目地操作。考虑到这一切，真嗣从未有一刻认为自己比明日香更优秀的飞行员。

And those things aside, was it really so bad? That Shinji surpassed Asuka just this once? Surely she couldn't be _that_ insecure.  
除了这些，真的有那么糟糕吗？真嗣这次超越了明日香，难道她真的如此缺乏安全感？

Suddenly, an angry thought flashed through his mind. _Do I have to stay under her forever? Remain the second-rate pilot to avoid making her angry? Is that the price I have to pay to keep her?_  
突然，一个愤怒的念头闪过他的脑海。难道我必须永远屈居她之下？为了不惹她生气，就只能做个二流驾驶员吗？这就是我为了留住她必须付出的代价吗？

_What am I to Asuka?  
我对明日香来说算什么？_

Shinji froze. Even in the suffocating heat of the summer night, he felt cold. A trickle of sweat ran down his back.  
真嗣僵住了。即便是在这闷热的夏夜，他仍感到一阵寒意。汗水顺着他的背脊滑落。

Shinji shook his head and headed for the bathroom. Asuka's door stayed closed.  
真嗣摇了摇头，走向浴室。明日香的房门依旧紧闭。

With arms that felt fine one minute and on fire the next, Shinji washed his underwear and shorts and rinsed himself off. By the end of the chore he managed to calm down a bit. Simple, repetitive tasks always had that effect on him.  
手臂时而感觉良好，时而如火烧般疼痛，真嗣洗好了内裤和短裤，并冲洗了身体。完成这些琐事后，他稍微平静了一些。简单重复的任务总能让他感到安心。

By the time he squeezed his clothes as tightly as his limp hands allowed, and hung them on a hangar that was as out of sight as he could manage, Shinji had come to a conclusion of sorts. That it was a good thing he hadn't gone to Asuka's room and he shouldn't go to her after this. That he should go straight to sleep.  
当他尽可能用力地挤干衣服，并用一个尽可能隐蔽的衣架挂起来时，真嗣得出了一个结论。幸好他没有去明日香的房间，而且之后也不应该去找她。他应该直接去睡觉。

Only pain waited behind that door.  
那扇门后只有痛苦在等待。

When he left the bathroom, he didn't go straight to his room, though. Instead, he headed for the kitchen, since his throat was dry as a desert. The sight of the towels on the floor made his heart sink again, but he was glad he'd found them now. What would Ms. Misato have thought if she'd come back early in the morning and seen them?  
离开浴室后，他并没有直接回自己的房间。相反，他走向了厨房，因为他的喉咙干得像沙漠一样。看到地板上的毛巾，他的心情再次沉重起来，但他很高兴现在找到了它们。如果美里小姐一大早回来看到这些，她会怎么想？

As he squatted down to pick up the towels, a thumping noise caught his attention. Realizing the source a moment later, Shinji hurried over to Penpen's fridge and pressed the lock button. The small door swung open, and the penguin jumped out from it. The sight of him flapping his wings and wobbling made Shinji chuckle.  
当他蹲下捡起毛巾时，一阵沉重的敲击声吸引了他的注意。片刻后意识到来源，真嗣急忙赶到 Penpen 的冰箱前，按下锁钮。小门应声而开，企鹅从中跳了出来。看到它扑腾着翅膀、摇摇晃晃的样子，真嗣忍不住笑了起来。

"Sorry. I completely forgot about you."  
“对不起，我完全把你忘了。”

The penguin stopped in his tracks and looked up at Shinji, his beady black eyes full of mistrust. It was somehow cute, so Shinji reached out and stroked his crest. "Are you angry?"  
企鹅停下脚步，抬头看着真嗣，那双黑色的小眼睛里满是怀疑。这副模样莫名地可爱，真嗣伸出手抚摸它的冠羽。“你在生气吗？”

Penpen lifted his head and bit down Shinji's finger with lightning speed. Shinji yelped and jerked his hand away. A drop of blood was forming on the second knuckle of his index finger. Anger bubbled up hotly in him.  
企鹅 Penpen 猛地抬起头，以迅雷不及掩耳之势咬住了真嗣的手指。真嗣痛得叫出声，急忙把手抽回。一滴血正从他食指的第二指节处渗出。怒火在他心中炽热地升腾。

"You little-" “你这个小——”

It wasn't until he saw Penpen was looking somewhere near his head that Shinji realized he'd raised his hand high. It shook.  
直到他注意到 Penpen 正盯着他头顶的某个地方，真嗣才意识到自己已经高举起手。那只手在颤抖。

There was no trace of fear in the beast's defiant eyes, as if goading him to try something. It was Shinji who was afraid. He couldn't understand how he had gotten to this point, and that scared him. He dropped his hand.  
野兽挑衅的眼睛里没有一丝恐惧，仿佛在挑逗他尝试些什么。害怕的是真嗣。他不明白自己是怎么走到这一步的，这让他感到恐惧。他放下了手。

"Sorry." "对不起。"

The penguin made something akin to a snorting sound and quickly disappeared in the direction of the bathroom, leaving Shinji alone on the kitchen floor just like Asuka did some hours ago. Not even looking back once, just like Asuka did. The thought made Shinji feel like laughing.  
企鹅发出类似哼声的声音，迅速朝浴室方向消失，留下真嗣独自在厨房地板上，就像几个小时前明日香所做的那样。甚至一次也没有回头，就像明日香那样。这个念头让真嗣觉得想笑。

Instead of laughter, it was a sigh that escaped his mouth, as he cupped his face in his hands.  
从他嘴里逃出来的不是笑声，而是一声叹息，他用手捧住了脸。

---

The day was only half over, but Asuka was already fed up with everything. This might be the worst day of her life.  
这一天才过了一半，但明日香已经对一切都感到厌烦了。这可能是她一生中最糟糕的一天。

Of course, that was an exaggeration. There were several days in her life that were exponentially worse than this. But still, this day was shaping up to make the list.  
当然，这是夸张的说法。她生命中有好几天比这糟糕得多。但即便如此，这一天也足以列入糟糕的日子之列。

Asuka rummaged impatiently through her bento. The look of the greasy, slightly cooled fried rice wasn't exactly appetizing.  
明日香不耐烦地翻找着她的便当。那油腻、略微冷却的炒饭看起来实在不怎么诱人。

Or maybe it was just her mood and the food was in fact fine.  
或许这只是她的心情作祟，食物实际上并没有问题。

For some stupid reason, she couldn't stop thinking about the night she was coldly rejected by Mr. Kaji on the way to Japan. She remembered the stinging humiliation afterwards, alone in her cabin.  
出于某种愚蠢的原因，她无法停止回想那晚在前往日本的路上被加持先生冷漠拒绝的情景。她记得之后独自在船舱里感受到的刺痛般的羞辱。

And that was very, very ridiculous. Because back then, Asuka was the one getting pushed away. But now she had done the pushing. It made something in her chest squirm uncomfortably.  
这真是非常非常荒谬。因为那时，是明日香被推开。但现在，她成了推开别人的那一方。这让她的内心感到一种不适的扭曲。

_Yeah, you stabbed him in the chest after he opened up to you. Just like Mr. Kaji.  
是啊，他在向你敞开心扉后，你却捅了他一刀。就像加治先生那样。_

_It's different_, a little voice in her head protested. It wasn't particularly convincing.  
她的脑海中有个小小的声音抗议道，这不一样。但这并不特别有说服力。

As was always the case when Asuka was backed into a corner, a part of her mind started to fight back. The part that couldn't bear the humiliation of being on the defensive, that always preferred to attack. The part that shifted blame to anyone but her.  
每当明日香陷入困境时，她的一部分心智总会开始反击。那个无法忍受处于防守地位的屈辱，总是倾向于主动出击的部分。那个总是将责任推给他人而非自己的部分。

_He should've followed me into the room, asked me what was wrong. He should've begged me to forgive him.  
他本该跟着我进房间，问我怎么了。他本该恳求我原谅他。_

_So you could reject him again?_ another voice shot back.  
这样你就能再次拒绝他吗？另一个声音反驳道。

Asuka frowned. Maybe she would have. No, she probably would have. If Shinji forced his way in, she might have given in eventually, or maybe she wouldn't have. She honestly didn't know, but she would have castigated him regardless. That was the conclusion she had reached yesterday when the sound of footsteps stopped in front of her door. She'd been waiting for Shinji to open it.  
明日香皱眉。或许她会的。不，她很可能会。如果真嗣强行闯入，她或许最终会妥协，又或许不会。她真的不知道，但她无论如何都会责备他。这是她昨天得出的结论，当时脚步声在她门前停下。她一直在等真嗣开门。

_Would I feel better now if he came to me, even if I kicked him out again?  
如果他现在来找我，即使我再次把他赶走，我会感觉好些吗？_

Probably. And Asuka was aware how disgustingly selfish that was.  
大概会。而明日香也清楚这有多么令人作呕的自私。

Of course, things didn't go that way. Shinji hadn't said a word to her all day. In the morning, when he stood still in front of the stove, clutching his arms, Asuka felt a little sorry and told him she would take care of breakfast and lunch today. Shinji merely nodded, not even looking at her. That was the last time they spoke.  
当然，事情并没有这样发展。真嗣一整天都没对她说一句话。早上，当他站在炉子前，紧抱着双臂时，明日香感到一丝歉意，告诉他今天她会负责早餐和午餐。真嗣只是点点头，甚至没有看她一眼。那是他们最后一次交谈。

But even if Shinji had acted boldly and came into her room and thrown himself at her feet like Asuka fantasized, it wouldn't have solved anything. There was a problem that existed independently of such issues, and she had no idea how to solve it.  
但即便真嗣果敢地闯入她的房间，像明日香幻想中那样扑倒在她脚下，也解决不了任何问题。有一个独立于此类问题之外的难题存在，而她对此毫无头绪。

The spoon that was plowing the bento had stopped moving at some point. Come to think of it, this bento itself was yet another symbol, a proof, a repetition of the problem that had plagued Asuka since yesterday.  
不知何时，那把在便当盒里翻搅的勺子已经停了下来。话说回来，这个便当本身又是一个象征，一个证明，是昨日以来困扰着明日香的问题的重复。

Asuka's own achievement. Underwhelming.  
明日香自己的成就。不尽人意。

Worse than Shinji's. 比真嗣的还糟糕。

She put her spoon down with a sigh. Her only consolation was that there was no one to see her like this. For the first time since her transfer, Asuka was eating lunch alone. There was no one sitting around her.  
她叹了口气，放下勺子。唯一让她感到安慰的是，没有人看到她这副模样。自从转学以来，这是明日香第一次独自吃午饭。周围没有一个人坐下。

The girls, who would have gathered around her in a normal situation, were all surrounding Hikari Horaki today. Her shy confession that she and Suzuhara had become official yesterday had caught the attention of the entire class.  
在正常情况下，那些本会围在她身边的女孩们，今天全都围在了洞木光身边。她昨天羞涩地坦白自己与铃原成为了正式情侣，这件事吸引了全班人的注意。

Asuka glanced briefly in the direction of Hikari. She was barely visible with all the girls surrounding her and gesturing wildly. The boys were similarly clustered in the opposite corner of the classroom, in their case centered around Suzuhara. The boy was scratching the back of his head, his cheeks slightly flushed.  
明日香朝光的方向瞥了一眼。她被一群女孩围得几乎看不见，她们激动地比划着。男生们则聚集在教室的另一角，以铃原为中心。那男孩正挠着后脑勺，脸颊微微泛红。

_So that monkey is able to blush_, she thought.  
原来那只猴子也会脸红，她心想。

It was Shinji, sitting close to Suzuhara, who caught Asuka's attention. He looked dazed, barely reacting to the incessant, excited chatter that was happening around him. The sight made her heart ache, but at the same time she was strangely irritated. She couldn't tell if it was directed at him, or herself, or someone or something other than both.  
是真嗣，坐在铃原旁边，吸引了明日香的注意。他看起来有些恍惚，对周围持续不断的兴奋交谈几乎毫无反应。这一幕让她心痛，但同时又莫名地感到恼火。她说不清这情绪是针对他，还是自己，或是其他什么人或事。

All she knew was that she couldn't take her eyes off of Shinji.  
她只知道，她的目光无法从真嗣身上移开。

He must have felt her gaze, because he turned toward her. Their eyes met.  
他一定是感受到了她的注视，因为他转向了她。他们的目光相遇了。

_Say something. Give me a reaction. Anything. Something I could see and judge and base my thoughts on.  
说点什么。给我一个反应。什么都行。一些我能看到、判断并据此思考的东西。_

Shinji frowned slightly and looked away.  
真嗣微微皱眉，移开了视线。

Well, that was something, at least. Asuka wanted to smile bitterly, but the tightness in her throat and the heat in her chest made it impossible.  
好吧，至少有点什么。明日香想苦笑一下，但喉咙的紧绷和胸口的灼热让她无法做到。

It felt like losing, to keep looking at Shinji while he wasn't looking at her, so she snorted and looked away too.  
继续看着真嗣而他却不看自己，这种感觉就像在认输，于是她也哼了一声，转过头去。

Asuka wanted to stop thinking about Shinji, so she tried to distract herself. It wasn't too difficult, as an outburst of giggles from the girls gathered around Hikari caught her attention. It was a kind of squeaking sound that Asuka had never heard in Germany, a noise only Japanese girls made when they were either distressed or surprised or saw something exceptionally cute.  
明日香想要停止思考关于真嗣的事情，于是她试图分散自己的注意力。这并不太难，因为光子周围聚集的女孩们爆发出的笑声吸引了她的注意。这是一种明日香在德国从未听过的声音，只有日本女孩在感到困扰、惊讶或看到特别可爱的事物时才会发出的那种尖细声。

"So? What did you guys do?"  
“然后呢？你们做了什么？”

At Maki's urging, Hikari continued, her face on fire. "He didn't let go of my hand. _You already lost Nozomi because the shelter is too crowded, what's the point if we get separated while looking for her, just stay right next to me,_ that's what he said."  
在真希的催促下，光子继续说道，她的脸红得像火一样。“他没有放开我的手。你说我们已经因为避难所太拥挤而失去了望，如果我们找她的时候再分开，那还有什么意义呢，就紧紧跟在我身边，他就是这么说的。”

"Ugh, acting all manly manly macho, huh? And Hikari fell right for it."  
"哼，装什么男子汉气概，是吧？结果光还就吃这一套。"

Everyone laughed, including Hikari, who primly covered her mouth with one hand.  
大家都笑了，包括光，她优雅地用一只手遮住嘴。

"And? What happened next?" asked Maki impatiently. Asuka almost wanted to ask why she was so eager.  
"然后呢？接下来发生了什么？" 真希不耐烦地问道。明日香几乎想问她为何如此急切。

"Um, well, we found her soon enough, but he wouldn't let me go even after that. Said I should let Kodama deal with her, that there's a place just outside the shelter where the view of the city was great, that I should definitely check it out."  
"嗯，我们很快就找到了她，但他还是不让我走。他说我应该让儿玉处理她，说避难所外有个地方可以看到城市的绝佳景色，我一定要去看看。"

Gasps erupted around Hikari. Asuka had to resist the urge to snort.  
光环周围爆发出惊呼声。明日香不得不忍住嗤之以鼻的冲动。

"So? Did you go there?"  
"那然后呢？你去那儿了吗？"

"So, I went out with him. It wasn't 'just outside', it was a bit of a hike up a mountain, but it was so worth it. You can see the whole basin there, the wind was cool, and it was quiet, too, since everyone was in the shelter."  
"所以，我和他出去了。不是'就在外面'，而是爬了一段山路，但绝对值得。在那里可以看到整个盆地，风很凉爽，也很安静，因为大家都躲在避难所里。"

"Wait, so you saw it? The Angel? Was it really _that_ enormous?"  
"等等，你真的看到了吗？那个天使？它真的有那么巨大吗？"

Someone asked, and before Hikari could answer the question, another girl interrupted.  
有人问道，还没等光回答，另一个女孩就插话了。

"Oh yeah, I heard it was big, like, really big. Heard Ikari was the one who killed it. But I've yet to meet someone who actually saw it. My family was evacuated over a mountain so we couldn't see anything"  
"哦，是啊，我听说那东西很大，真的非常大。听说碇是干掉它的那个人。但我还没遇到过真正见过它的人。我们家是被疏散到山那边的，所以我们什么也没看到。"

Asuka gritted her teeth and picked up her spoon. She wasn't the only one who didn't want the story to derail, though, and once again, Maki swooped in to clear the traffic.  
明日香咬紧牙关，拿起她的勺子。她不是唯一一个不希望故事跑偏的人，不过，真希再次及时介入，清理了障碍。

"Oh please shut up! That's not important right now! So, Hikari, what happened after that? What did you two do there...?"  
"哦，拜托闭嘴！现在这不重要！那么，光，之后发生了什么？你们俩在那里做了什么...？"

Hikari blushed, lowering her head. Everyone waited, not even breathing. Even Asuka put down the rice she just picked up and eyed Hikari, as some genuine interest bloomed inside her.  
光子脸红了，低下头。所有人都屏息以待。就连明日香也放下了刚拿起的饭团，目光转向光子，心中涌起了一丝真切的兴趣。

Hikari twisted a lock of her hair around her pinky once, twice, thrice, and blushed until her freckles were bright, bright red. Then she finally, timidly spoke up.  
光子将一缕头发绕在无名指上，一次，两次，三次，脸红得连雀斑都变得鲜红。然后她终于怯生生地开口了。

"We confessed. I don't know how the conversation got there, but... somehow it ended up like that."  
“我们坦白了。我不知道话题是怎么转到那里的，但……不知怎么的，就那样了。”

Asuka sighed at the lame conclusion, so tame compared to the almost grandiose introduction.  
明日香对着这平淡无奇的结局叹了口气，与那几乎宏大的开场相比，实在是太平淡了。

_So much for all the fuss. You'd think they kissed or something. What a child.  
闹了半天就这？还以为他们亲上了呢。真是个孩子。_

Shaking her head, Asuka lifted a spoonful of rice, then stopped in her tracks. Something was strange in the air. She looked up to find the entire group of girls staring at her wordlessly, including Hikari. Asuka felt her throat tighten.  
明日香摇了摇头，舀起一勺米饭，却突然停住了。空气中弥漫着一种奇怪的气氛。她抬头一看，发现整个女孩团体都无声地盯着她，包括光。明日香感到喉咙一紧。

_Shit, did I actually blurt that out? Or are they angry over just a sigh?  
该死，我真的大声说出来了？还是他们只是因为一声叹息而生气？_

As everyone watched in stunned silence, Hikari smiled awkwardly, as if to confirm Asuka's thoughts. "Yeah, maybe it's nothing to you, Asuka. We're all a bit childish compared to you, we can't really help that. You're a pilot and a university graduate and all."  
在众人震惊的沉默中，光尴尬地笑了笑，仿佛在确认明日香的想法。“是啊，也许对你来说没什么，明日香。和我们相比，我们都有些幼稚，这也没办法。你是驾驶员，又是大学毕业生，各方面都很优秀。”

Asuka suddenly wished that the ground would swallow her up. It was a novel feeling. _Of course,_ she thought, trying to banish the embarrassment, but the words fell flat even in her head. Maybe she should walk with Hikari when school let out to make it up to her. Not like Shinji would care.  
明日香突然希望地面能将她吞没。这是一种新奇的感觉。当然，她试图驱散这种尴尬，但这些话在她脑海中听起来也显得无力。也许放学后她应该和光一起走，以此来弥补。反正真嗣也不会在意。

_Why would she leave her boyfriend alone and walk with you? Who do you think you are? Think about a way to make up with your own boyfriend, you silly girl.  
她为什么要丢下男朋友，和你一起走？你以为你是谁？想想怎么和自己的男朋友和好吧，你这个傻姑娘。_

If it had been just Hikari and her, she might have been able to handle this with ease, without too much trouble. Maybe just a simple gesture or even an apology. But the whole class, or at least the female half of it, was watching her now, and she couldn't quickly think of a way to save face.  
如果只是她和光在一起，她或许能轻松应对，不会太麻烦。也许只是一个简单的举动，甚至是一句道歉。但现在全班，至少是女生们，都在看着她，她一时想不出挽回面子的办法。

But staying silent for too long was also a sign of weakness, so Asuka cleared her throat once and spoke up.  
但沉默太久也是软弱的表现，所以明日香清了清嗓子，开口了。

"Well, we-" "嗯，我们——"

"Hey, Hikari. I think a little differently."  
"嘿，光。我有些不同的想法。"

Someone sucked in a sharp breath in surprise, but everyone else shut their mouths and watched in silence as befit a classroom that smelled drama. At the periphery of her vision, Asuka saw that even some of the boys were starting to glance her way, sensing something was amiss.  
有人因惊讶而猛吸了一口气，但其他人则闭上了嘴，静静地注视着，正如一间弥漫着戏剧气息的教室应有的氛围。在她的视线边缘，明日香注意到甚至有些男生也开始向她这边投来目光，察觉到有些不对劲。

Asuka looked to the source of the voice. It was the girl standing nearest to Hikari, gripping the back of a chair with both hands. A well-maintained, glossy hime cut caught Asuka's eyes. Yuko. Recently started to date a third grader named Taro after chasing him around for some time.  
明日香循声望去，声音来自站在光身边紧握椅背的女孩。她那打理得光鲜亮丽的公主切发型吸引了明日香的目光。优子，最近开始与一个名叫太郎的三年级学生交往，之前追了他好一阵子。

By the time Asuka remembered that info, Yuko was still talking.  
等到明日香想起这些信息时，优子还在继续说着。

"I always noticed that when we talked about boys and dating, Asuka would always just nod and agree and whatever, but she'd never tell us anything. And she _always_ dodges when we try and ask her about it! Can't help but wonder, you know, if she's just pretending to know things to cover up the fact that she actually doesn't have any experience at all."  
“我注意到每次我们谈论男生和约会时，明日香总是点头附和，却从不分享自己的事。而且每当我们试图问她这方面的事，她总是回避！不禁让人好奇，她是不是为了掩饰自己其实毫无经验而假装懂行。”

Then Yuko paused and flicked her hair with an exaggerated, theatrical gesture. It was kind of cute. She must be thinking she already won. And how long had she been waiting for this moment? Dreaming of usurping her?  
随后优子停顿了一下，夸张地戏剧性地甩了甩头发。有点可爱。她一定以为自己已经赢了。她等这一刻等了多久？梦想着篡位吗？

"Well, it's understandable that you're inexperienced," Yuko continued, a smirk beginning to appear on her lips. "Having high standards is natural. Surely very few boys would satisfy _you._ I really understand that. But don't you think it's a little presumptuous, then? To look down on other girls' dating lives when you've never had a boyfriend yourself? I'm sure you wouldn't like it if we started to act all high and mighty about Evangelion fights. So what gives you the right to talk down to Hikari so easily?"  
“嗯，你缺乏经验是可以理解的，”优子继续说道，嘴角开始浮现出一丝讥笑。“高标准是自然的。当然很少有男孩能满足你。我真的理解。但你不觉得这有点自以为是吗？当你自己从未有过男朋友时，对其他女孩的恋爱生活指手画脚？我敢肯定，如果我们开始对《新世纪福音战士》的战斗指指点点，你也不会喜欢。那么你有什么权利这么轻易地对光指手画脚呢？”

With that, Yuko paused with a smug grin, as if daring Asuka to shoot back. At the sight, Asuka felt a cruel delight that was almost close to bliss. Only then did Asuka realize that this was exactly the kind of thing she needed right now. A shiver ran down her spine.  
说完，优子带着得意的笑容停了下来，仿佛在挑衅明日香回击。看到这一幕，明日香感到一种近乎幸福的残酷快感。直到那时，明日香才意识到这正是她现在所需要的。她的脊背一阵发凉。

If Hikari complained to her, Asuka would have found neither the justification nor the will to react venomously. What was instead happening was a despicable attempt to push Asuka further down the pecking order while pretending to stand up for Hikari, and at minimum half of the class was witnessing it in suspense.  
如果光向她抱怨，明日香既找不到理由也没有意愿去恶毒回应。实际上发生的是一场卑鄙的尝试，企图在假装为光撑腰的同时将明日香进一步推下等级秩序的底层，而至少有一半的班级同学正紧张地目睹这一切。

It was also the first serious challenge against Asuka since her transfer.  
这也是自明日香转学以来，对她发起的第一次严肃挑战。

Asuka had secured her position at the top of the food chain within the first week of her arrival in Japan. All the girls had instantly recognized her looks, intelligence, and her status as a pilot. And, after several skirmishes that she quashed with ease, everyone submitted to her unyielding, indomitable personality. Most just prostrated themselves to her after that without a fight, acknowledging her as someone higher in the totem pole of class politics. Some girls with their own established positions showed an appropriate reverence and kept a respectful distance, creating a relationship that was built on mutual respect that also noted one party's superior position.  
明日香在日本抵达后的第一周内就稳固了自己在食物链顶端的位置。所有女生立刻意识到她的外貌、智慧以及作为驾驶员的身份。并且，在几次轻松平息的小冲突后，所有人都臣服于她那不屈不挠、不可战胜的性格。此后，大多数人直接向她屈服，不再反抗，承认她在班级政治中的地位更高。一些拥有自己稳固地位的女生则表现出适当的敬意，保持一定距离，建立起基于相互尊重但又明确一方处于优势地位的关系。

This was just another little rebellion. She knew how to deal with this. There was no reason to show mercy. What was left to do was hang, draw, and quarter.  
这不过是又一次小小的反叛。她知道如何应对这种情况。没有理由展现仁慈。剩下的就是绞刑、剥皮和分尸。

Asuka smiled softly as she organized the relevant information in her head for offense and defense. Indeed, there was more than enough ammunition.  
明日香微微一笑，将相关的攻防信息在脑海中整理妥当。确实，弹药充足。

Asuka doubted that Yuko had any idea of the frequency of her appearances in class gossip. She was the second most frequently talked about person in the class, just behind the Hikari-Suzuhara saga. That she was chosen as this quarter's plaything for that handsome fuckboy Taro was a huge scandal on its own. Even Shinji was aware of that, having been told so by Asuka one evening.  
明日香怀疑优子是否意识到自己在班级八卦中出现的频率。她是班上第二常被谈论的人，仅次于光-铃原的传奇。被那个英俊的花花公子太郎选为本季的玩物，本身就是个大丑闻。就连真嗣也知道这件事，某天晚上明日香告诉他的。

And the gall of her, daring to talk about _experience._ Asuka had to steady herself a bit as she felt like bursting out laughing. Losing her temper would be bad, but laughing uncontrollably would hamper her line delivery, too.  
她竟然敢大谈经验，真是厚颜无耻。明日香不得不稳住自己，因为她感觉快要笑出声来。发脾气不好，但无法控制的大笑也会影响她的台词表现。

_If you tried this just a few weeks earlier, I would have had no defense. Fortune isn't on your side, stupid girl.  
如果这是几周前的事，我根本无法应对。幸运女神没有站在你这边，愚蠢的女孩。_

Asuka shook her head in exasperation, then tilted it slightly.  
明日香无奈地摇了摇头，然后微微侧了侧头。

"I hear what you're saying, _Yuki._ I agree with some of it. Like, that I have high standards. Or that I'd feel bad if you pretended to know about Evangelion stuff. Or that someone shouldn't talk about things they have never experienced."  
“我明白你的意思，由纪。我同意其中一些观点。比如，我确实有很高的标准。或者，如果你假装了解《新世纪福音战士》的东西，我会感到难过。还有，一个人不应该谈论他们从未经历过的事情。”

Yuko opened her mouth with a slightly flushed face, but Asuka continued without the slightest pause. "But I want to set one thing straight: what makes you think _you_ of all people have any right to belittle me for my experience? Or apparent lack thereof, according to you?"  
优子微微涨红了脸，张开嘴想要说话，但明日香毫不间断地继续说道：“但我想澄清一点：你凭什么认为你就有资格因为我的经历——或者按照你的说法，缺乏经历——而贬低我？”

Asuka hoped that Yuko would take the bait. Attacking Yuko's own dating life and bringing it to the forefront would deflect the argument from Hikari's own experiences to Yuko's. That way Hikari wouldn't be caught in the crossfire and humiliated as a result, and Asuka could enjoy her victory guilt-free.  
明日香希望优子会上钩。攻击优子自己的恋爱生活并将其置于争论的焦点，可以将话题从光自己的经历转移到优子身上。这样一来，光就不会卷入交火中，也不会因此受到羞辱，而明日香则可以毫无愧疚地享受她的胜利。

So, when Yuko reacted exactly as Asuka had expected, a triumphant smile crept up on her lips.  
所以，当优子如明日香所料般做出反应时，她嘴角不由得浮现出一丝得意的微笑。

"Well, I'm sure I have more right to talk about this matter than you, Asuka."  
“好吧，我肯定比你更有资格谈论这件事，明日香。”

Asuka raised her eyebrows, making a blatantly fake surprised face.  
明日香挑起眉毛，摆出一副明显是装出来的惊讶表情。

"Really? I never thought that way. I mean, no way a manwhore like Takurou would still be dating you if he fucked you already! He'd have moved on to new prey long ago. He's famous for that, after all, collecting virgins. You're what, his third girl this year? Honestly, I thought you were smart for not spreading your legs for him right away, Yuki. I was thinking maybe you would be the one to fix that boy. I'm a little disappointed, really. I was rooting for you. And, you know, don't you think it's a little early for that? You're just a kid."  
真的吗？我从没这么想过。我是说，像拓郎那样的花花公子，如果已经和你上过床了，怎么可能还和你约会！他早就该去猎取新目标了。毕竟他可是以收集处女闻名的，不是吗？你今年是他的第三个女孩了吧？说真的，我以为你很聪明，没有立刻就和他上床，由纪。我还在想，或许你能改变那小子呢。现在有点失望，真的。我可是一直支持你的。而且，你不觉得现在就那样有点太早了吗？你还只是个孩子啊。

Someone gasped, perhaps because Asuka's rhetoric was much more vulgar than anyone could have expected. Asuka smiled warmly at the sight of Yuko's reddened face. The other girl was backed into a corner and they both knew it. Firing back on Asuka calling them the wrong names meant acknowledging Asuka's implication that they were not even worthy of her memory. If she protested against actually sleeping with Taro, she'd be admitting that she was still indeed a child. It wasn't even worth attempting to defend her boyfriend's past history. Not replying, or even hesitating to reply, was admitting defeat. The only possible way out was countering Asuka's attack on her age. Asuka sat back, waiting.  
有人倒吸了一口气，或许是因为明日香的说辞比任何人预想的都要粗俗。明日香看到由子的脸涨红，温暖地笑了。另一个女孩被逼到了墙角，她们都心知肚明。回击明日香叫错名字意味着承认明日香暗示她们连被她记住的资格都没有。如果她抗议与太郎实际发生关系，那就等于承认自己仍然是个孩子。试图为男友的过去辩解根本不值一提。不回应，甚至犹豫回应，都是承认失败。唯一的出路是反驳明日香对她年龄的攻击。明日香坐回原位，等待着。

"We're still... Taro's been..." Yuko rambled for a moment, but she managed to compose herself and snorted. She wasn't that much of a weakling, although Asuka was still playing her like a fiddle. "Have you forgotten that you and I are the same age?"  
“我们还是……太郎他……”由子支吾了一会儿，但她设法镇定下来，哼了一声。她没那么软弱，尽管明日香依然像操纵提线木偶一样玩弄她。“你忘了你和我同岁吗？”

"Oh, have you forgotten that you and I..." Asuka smirked and shook her head slightly. "...are not living the same life?"  
“哦，你忘了你和我……”明日香微微一笑，轻轻摇了摇头。“……过的不是同一种生活吗？”

One would have to be even less perceptive than Shinji to recognize Asuka's hidden words. _You and I are not of the same class._ The thought of Shinji made Asuka wonder what he was doing, so she briefly glanced around. The small groups of girls that stubbornly didn't join Hikari, and the boys around Suzuhara were all looking this way, intently watching the unfolding drama. Suzuhara, who was the center of a large group like Hikari, was looking back and forth between Asuka and Yuko with a blank expression on his tanned face. There was only one person who didn't show any interest in Asuka. It was the First, sitting in her seat and looking out the window. Even Shinji, who had consciously avoided Asuka so far, was now watching her with a guarded look on his face. After exchanging a glance with him for a moment, Asuka turned her eyes back to Yuko. Asuka wasn't sure what to make of Shinji's look, but she couldn't waste any more time now. With a haughty smile, Asuka continued her attack.  
要察觉到明日香隐晦的言外之意，恐怕得比真嗣还要迟钝才行。你我并非同路人。想到真嗣，明日香不禁好奇他在做什么，于是她匆匆环视四周。那些执意不加入光的小团体女生，以及围绕在铃原身边的男生们，都目不转睛地盯着这场正在上演的戏码。铃原，如同光一样被大群人簇拥的中心，正来回打量着明日香和优子，他那被晒黑的脸上露出茫然的表情。唯独一人对明日香毫无兴趣，那就是坐在座位上望向窗外的第一适格者。就连一直有意避开明日香的真嗣，此刻也正警惕地注视着她。与他对视片刻后，明日香将目光转回优子身上。她对真嗣的眼神感到困惑，但眼下已无暇多想。明日香带着傲然的微笑，继续发起攻势。

"You know, the human brain is a funny thing. Once it tastes death, it instinctively demands confirmation that it's actually alive. And there's nothing that makes you feel more alive than, you know, _that._ I need that. I hope you don't. Not yet, anyway. I do this whole piloting thing precisely so you don't have to experience a life-or-death crisis. We're on totally different levels. You could never understand what it's like."  
"你知道吗，人类的大脑是个有趣的东西。一旦它尝到了死亡的滋味，就会本能地要求确认自己是否真的还活着。而没有什么比，你知道的，那个更能让你感到自己活着了。我需要那个。我希望你不需要。至少现在还不需要。我做这一切驾驶的事情正是为了让你不必经历生死攸关的危机。我们完全不在一个层面上。你永远无法理解那种感觉。"

Of course, she made this whole thing up. Asuka had never really thought much about it, and there was even a part of her that wondered if she was being too theatrical, dramatic, and a little too pretentious. But at the same time, a part of her felt it actually rang true, that it was plausible. She wasn't sure if it was a voice from a part of her that didn't want to feel like a liar, trying to believe her own lies, or if this kind of thing was always in her heart, just not recognized until now. She didn't know. But then again, Asuka's mind was always full of such vague and self-contradicting ideas.  
当然，这一切都是她编造的。明日香其实从未真正深思过这些，甚至有一部分她怀疑自己是否过于戏剧化、夸张和有点做作。但与此同时，她又觉得这番话确实有几分真实，是可信的。她不确定这是否是她内心不愿觉得自己在撒谎的那部分，试图相信自己的谎言，还是这种想法一直深藏在她心中，只是至今未被察觉。她不知道。但话说回来，明日香的心思总是充满了这种模糊且自相矛盾的想法。

Asuka turned her gaze to Shinji once more. He was looking down at the desk in front of him. It felt almost disconcerting to see him looking away, when every single other face she could see was turned towards her, nervously watching.  
明日香再次将目光转向真嗣。他正低头看着面前的桌子。看到他避开视线，而她能看到的每一张脸都紧张地转向她，这种感觉几乎令人不安。

_We would have announced ourselves one way or another anyway. This is becoming weird, yes, but we're still on schedule, Shinji.  
我们无论如何都会以某种方式宣布自己的。这确实变得奇怪了，是的，但我们仍在计划中，真嗣。_

Even as she thought that, Asuka couldn't help but feel something tugging at her heart.  
尽管如此，明日香还是忍不住感到心中有什么在牵动着。

But none of that was important right now. She would have time to think about it later. Her own truth. Shinji's reaction to her actions. Their recent crisis. Their sync rates. The broken promise. All of it.  
但眼下这些都不重要。她稍后会有时间去思考这一切。她自己的真相。真嗣对她行为的反应。他们最近的危机。他们的同步率。那个破碎的承诺。所有的一切。

What mattered now was whether Yuko would fall into Asuka's carefully constructed trap and open herself up for the final blow that would slaughter her for good.  
现在关键在于，优子是否会落入明日香精心布置的陷阱，敞开心扉迎接那致命一击，彻底击垮她。

"Yuko, Asuka, it's not a big deal, alright? Now you..." Hikari, realizing that the situation was completely out of control, stood up awkwardly and placed a hand on Yuko's shoulder, but there was no way she could salvage things at this point. Yuko leaned to the other side and shrugged away from Hikari's hand, then crossed her arms.  
“优子，明日香，这没什么大不了的，好吗？现在你们……”光子意识到局面已完全失控，尴尬地站起身，将手放在优子的肩上，但此刻她已无力回天。优子向另一侧倾斜，甩开了光子的手，然后交叉双臂。

And just like that, Yuko stepped into the final phase of Asuka's game.  
就这样，优子踏入了明日香游戏的最终阶段。

"Wow, that was an amazing speech, Asuka. I guess Evangelion pilots really do live a life that a normal kid like me can't even imagine. I admit it. But Asuka, may I ask who he is, then? You made me really curious. You admitted it yourself that you have high standards. Who could possibly comfort the great Asuka Langley Soryu, then? Who is this equally great boy, I wonder?"  
“哇，那真是一场精彩的演讲，明日香。看来 EVA 驾驶员的生活，像我这样的普通孩子真是无法想象。我承认这一点。不过，明日香，我能问一下他是谁吗？你让我真的很好奇。你自己也承认标准很高。那么，谁能安慰伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷呢？我想知道，这位同样伟大的男孩是谁？”

A corner of Yuko's mouth twitched upward in a mocking arc. "Don't you dare say he goes to a different school or something. Or that you left him behind in Germany, or that we wouldn't know him."  
优子嘴角微微上扬，露出一丝嘲讽的弧度。“你可别说他是在别的学校什么的。或者你把他留在德国了，或者我们不认识他。”

With fingers that trembled slightly because they were already excited by the smell of blood in the air, Asuka untied the watch from her left wrist. In the place where the strap had come undone, the bruise Shinji had made yesterday morning revealed itself, the blue smudge stark against her pale skin. A susurrus of whispers picked up as people began to notice it. Asuka raised her left hand in a slow, theatrical pose. It was so funny and fulfilling to see everyone's heads turning at the same time, like puppies watching their master lift a rubber ball.  
手指微微颤抖，因为空气中血的气味已令她兴奋不已，明日香解开了左腕上的手表。表带松开的地方，昨天早晨真嗣留下的淤青显露出来，那片蓝色在她苍白的肌肤上格外刺眼。一阵窃窃私语声随之而起，人们开始注意到它。明日香缓缓地、戏剧性地举起左手。看到所有人同时转头，就像小狗盯着主人举起橡胶球一样，既滑稽又令人满足。

The tension in the classroom was tauter than the last thread of rope holding a climber above the abyss. Everyone waited for Asuka to speak. Then the sound of a chair scraping across the floor ripped through the quiet like an explosion. Everyone whipped their heads around in shock. It was Shinji, walking away. Leaving. Leaving Asuka and her drama behind.  
教室里的紧张气氛比悬在深渊之上的最后一根绳索还要紧绷。所有人都等待着明日香开口。接着，椅子在地板上刮擦的声音如同爆炸般撕裂了寂静。众人惊愕地转头。是真嗣，他正走开。离去。留下明日香和她的一场戏。

_What are you doing? You are the key witness. You can't leave the courtroom yet. No, you're not just a witness, you are the main character, along with me.  
你在做什么？你是关键证人。你还不能离开法庭。不，你不只是证人，你和我一样，是主角。_

Before Shinji could take two steps, Asuka spoke up. "Shinji, where are you going? Before you go, would you mind explaining to Yuki here what you did to my wrist yesterday?"  
还没等真嗣迈出两步，明日香就开口了。“真嗣，你要去哪儿？走之前，能不能跟这里的由纪解释一下你昨天对我手腕做了什么？”

Whispers grew. Shinji looked back at Asuka, wide-eyed and pale, but didn't say anything. But Asuka wasn't expecting an answer from him anyway. If Shinji had answered it could throw her off-balance, depending on what he said. So, with everything under control and in her expectation, Asuka didn't let up her momentum and continued.  
窃窃私语声渐起。真嗣回头看向明日香，眼睛睁得大大的，脸色苍白，却什么也没说。但明日香本来也没指望他回答。如果真嗣真的回答了，可能会让她失去平衡，这取决于他说什么。所以，一切都在掌控之中，符合她的预期，明日香没有放松攻势，继续说道。

"I didn't even say no. I just told you to cool it until we got home, but you couldn't even wait that long, could you? So rough. Pinning me down and doing whatever you wanted to me. You hurt me, you know. You really should be more careful next time. You don't realize how strong you actually are."  
“我甚至没说不同意。我只是让你等到回家再说，但你连那点时间都等不了，对吧？那么粗暴。把我按住，对我为所欲为。你弄疼我了，你知道吗。下次真的应该更小心些。你不知道自己实际上有多强。”

Though her words were addressing Shinji, Asuka was keeping her eyes on Yuko the entire time. The barely concealed panic on Yuko's face amused her. The rumbling that spread like wildfire sounded to Asuka's ears like the prelude to a symphony that sang of her triumph.  
尽管她的话语是针对真嗣，但明日香始终将目光锁定在优子身上。优子脸上那几乎掩饰不住的恐慌让她感到有趣。那如同野火般蔓延的轰鸣声，在明日香听来，就像是预示着她胜利的交响乐前奏。

"What the hell was that?" Suzuhara muttered.  
“那到底是什么鬼东西？”铃原低声嘀咕道。

The others fell silent again, intently watching Shinji's mouth, waiting for his confirmation or denial.  
其他人再次陷入沉默，全神贯注地盯着真嗣的嘴，等待他的确认或否认。

"Asuka..." Shinji muttered. It came out strained, almost like a whimper.  
"明日香..." 真嗣喃喃道。声音听起来很勉强，几乎像是在呜咽。

It wasn't a very satisfying response, but it was within the expected range, and it was enough to accomplish Asuka's goal anyway. Indeed, everyone apparently got the message, falling into shocked silence. It took several seconds until someone spoke up.  
这个回答并不令人满意，但仍在预期范围内，无论如何，这足以达到明日香的目的。确实，所有人都明显收到了信息，陷入了震惊的沉默。过了好几秒才有人开口。

"Oh my God, he's not denying."  
"哦，我的天，他没有否认。"

Suzuhara jumped out of his seat. "Woah, this shit's-"  
铃原从座位上跳了起来。“哇，这玩意儿——”

"Wait." A cold voice interrupted Suzuhara. At the same time, porcelain-white fingers appeared from behind his shoulder and pressed him down, forcing him back into his seat.  
“等等。”一个冷冰冰的声音打断了铃原。与此同时，一双瓷白色的手指从他肩后伸出，按住他，迫使他重新坐下。

As Suzuhara spun around and shouted, Rei Ayanami moved through the gap Suzuhara was blocking a moment ago like a floating ghost. All eyes, including those of Hikari, Yuko, Shinji, and Asuka, turned to her.  
铃原转过身大喊时，绫波零像幽灵般穿过他刚才挡住的空隙。包括光、优子、真嗣和明日香在内的所有人，目光都转向了她。

This was unexpected even for Asuka. The sight of the First's pale lips parting tensed Asuka up.  
即便是对明日香来说，这也是意料之外的。一瞥见绫波零苍白的嘴唇微微张开，明日香便紧张起来。

"Second. You're either lying or unintentionally misrepresenting what transpired between you and Ikari. I was there. I saw it."  
“二号机。你不是在撒谎，就是无意中歪曲了你和碇之间发生的事。我当时在场，我亲眼所见。”

Asuka's heart froze. 明日香的心瞬间凝固了。

_What the hell is wrong with this bitch...?  
这个婊子到底怎么回事...？_

"Did I hear it right? Is she saying it's a lie?"  
我听对了吗？她是在说那是谎言吗？

"Pilot civil war! Pilot civil war!"  
“飞行员内战！飞行员内战！”

Girls started to whisper.  
女孩们开始窃窃私语。

In contrast to Asuka's rapidly draining face, color returned to Yuko's. She was about to open her mouth to speak, almost gleefully, but when Rei Ayanami showed signs of continuing, she quickly returned to a very respectful listening position. Asuka's insides burned.  
与明日香脸色迅速变白形成鲜明对比，优子的脸上恢复了血色。她正要张嘴说话，几乎带着一丝得意，但当绫波零有继续发言的迹象时，她迅速恢复到非常恭敬的倾听姿态。明日香内心燃起了怒火。

"The intercourse between you and Ikari was a mutually consensual endeavor. It is true you rejected him several times, but those were clearly rhetorical and inconsistent with your other actions and words, and Ikari was, ultimately, acting under both your implicit and explicit consent. Your disputes with your fellow students are none of my business, but spreading misinformation about Ikari's character and actions is unacceptable. And…"  
“你与碇之间的性行为是双方自愿的行为。确实，你多次拒绝了他，但那些显然是修辞性的，与你其他的行为和言辞不一致，而碇最终是在你明示和暗示的同意下行事的。你与同学们的争执与我无关，但散布关于碇性格和行为的错误信息是不可接受的。而且……”

Something flashed in the First Child's red eyes. "I am not as ignorant of context as you think. If you think you can distort events that I have directly witnessed, you are making a grave mistake."  
第一适格者的红眸中闪过一丝光芒。“我并非如你所想那般对背景一无所知。如果你以为可以歪曲我亲眼目睹的事件，那你犯了个严重的错误。”

The monotone voice ended, and a deathly silence descended on the classroom. Asuka thought she could hear the faint rasp of everyone's eyelids opening and closing. The silence went on, and on, and on, and on, and on, before finally being broken by a slapping sound as Shinji's hands covered his face.  
单调的声音落下，教室内陷入一片死寂。明日香觉得自己能听到每个人眼皮开合的细微摩擦声。寂静持续着，持续着，持续着，持续着，持续着，直到最终被一声拍击声打破，那是真嗣双手捂住脸的声音。

What followed was a roar that resembled an overturned beehive, if the bees were the size of schoolchildren and a loudspeaker was held up to the hive. Asuka burst out laughing. The most she could make out in the cacophony was someone screaming at the top of her lungs, "I knew it! I told you they were a thing!" Many girls, like Kaori and others, ran over to Asuka, circling her and grabbing her hands and chattering excitedly, but Asuka couldn't even remember what she'd said to them. She must have given some response, but that was it. She only remembered that she laughed until her stomach ached.  
随之而来的是一阵轰鸣，宛如翻倒的蜂巢，如果那些蜜蜂有学童大小，并且有人将扩音器对准了蜂巢。明日香爆发出大笑。在这片嘈杂中，她最多能分辨出有人声嘶力竭地尖叫：“我就知道！我告诉过你们他们有情况！”许多女孩，像香织和其他人，跑向明日香，围着她，抓住她的手，兴奋地叽叽喳喳，但明日香甚至记不清自己对她们说了什么。她一定给出了某种回应，但仅此而已。她只记得自己笑到肚子疼。

All the while her eyes were searching for Shinji. He wasn't where he was standing a moment ago, making it hard to find him among the chaos. It took a moment for Asuka to realize why the boy was so hard to find; Suzuhara, grinning like an idiot, had Shinji in a headlock and was screaming something in his ear. Pinned between Suzuhara's arm and armpit, limp and unmoving, Shinji was at an angle where Asuka couldn't see his face.  
她的目光一直在寻找真嗣。他不在刚才站立的地方，在这片混乱中很难找到他。过了一会儿，明日香才意识到为什么那个男孩这么难找；铃原像傻瓜一样咧嘴笑着，把真嗣夹在腋下，对着他的耳朵大喊大叫。被铃原的胳膊和腋窝夹在中间，软绵绵地一动不动，真嗣的角度让明日香看不到他的脸。

_I had to make sure, after all.  
毕竟，我得确认一下。_

Just as Asuka was thinking that, Hikari entered her sight. Most of the girls who had gathered around her until a moment ago had split off into smaller groups of two or three or flocked to Asuka now, all of them chattering frantically, and Hikari was left sitting alone. When their eyes met, Hikari smiled awkwardly, then looked away and stared into an empty space. At that moment, Asuka realized that there was an element to this situation that she hadn't considered.  
就在明日香这么想的时候，光进入了她的视线。大多数女孩直到刚才还围在她身边，现在都分散成了两三人一组，或者聚到了明日香身边，全都急切地聊着天，而光则独自坐着。当她们的目光相遇时，光尴尬地笑了笑，然后移开视线，盯着空荡荡的地方。就在那一刻，明日香意识到这个情况中有一个她未曾考虑到的因素。

_Did I steal your spotlight, Hikari? Did I make today my day when it should have been yours?  
我是不是抢了你的风头，光？我是不是把今天变成了我的日子，而本该是你的？_

The thought made Asuka's heart heavy for a moment, but the next moment she found Yuko, standing alone, her face red, and that sight made all the heavy feelings disappear, forgotten.  
这个念头让明日香的心沉了一下，但下一刻她看到了优子，独自站着，脸颊通红，那一幕让所有沉重的感觉都消失了，被遗忘。

Asuka won. 明日香赢了。

She crushed the challenge and kept her rightful spot.  
她碾碎了挑战，保住了自己的正当位置。

Nothing was more important than that.  
没有什么比这更重要的了。

---

Stepping into the observation booth, Misato grabbed the front of her blouse and shook it a few times. Her entire body felt sticky and disgusting, and she was nearing the end of her rope. She couldn't wait to get off work and go home to sleep.  
走进观察室，美里抓住衬衫前襟，抖了几下。她全身都觉得黏腻恶心，已经快到极限了。她迫不及待地想下班回家睡觉。

Against the backdrop of reinforced windows overlooking a test hangar, Ritsuko stood among rows and rows of computer terminals, all of them turned off for now. There were no other personnel in the room, just the two of them. Ritsuko was holding printouts in her hand, reading them, when she noticed Misato.  
在俯瞰着测试机库的加固窗户背景下，赤木律子站在一排排计算机终端之间，目前所有设备都处于关闭状态。房间里没有其他人员，只有她们两人。赤木律子手里拿着打印件，正在阅读，这时她注意到了美里。

"Quite busy, huh?" “挺忙的，是吧？”

"Yeah. Something happened at the recovery site. Had to go up to the surface."  
“嗯。回收现场出了点事。不得不上到地面去。”

There was an attempt by the civilian government to readjust part of the cordon, citing traffic congestion, even though the remains of the Angel were still a long way from being disposed of. It was such a blatant overstepping of the authority there wasn't even room for negotiation. Normally, a simple phone call and a short threat would have been enough to settle the matter, and Misato had actually thought she had done so after such a phone call several hours ago. But the City Council itself had contacted her after that, complicating things. They half-protested and half-begged her to at least see the state of the traffic with her own eyes before quoting rules and whatnot. Misato had decided that she should at least show up before rejecting them, figuring that would be diplomatically wise.  
民间政府曾试图调整部分封锁线，以缓解交通拥堵为由，尽管天使的遗骸远未处理完毕。这种公然越权的行为甚至没有谈判的余地。通常情况下，一个简单的电话和简短的威胁就足以解决问题，而美里在几小时前的那通电话后，本以为事情已经解决。但随后市议会直接联系了她，使情况变得复杂。他们半是抗议半是恳求，希望她在引用规章制度之前，至少亲自看看交通状况。美里决定，在拒绝之前应该露面，认为这样在策略上更为明智。

Well, the condition of the sectors neighboring the cordoned area really was an astronomical mess. This was not the first time that fighting had taken place in the city center, but the size of the Angel was exceptional, and the location of its demise overlapped with an intersection of several major roads. Historically, it was one of the busiest ones in the city. Even Misato's usual commute route was seeing a choking traffic jam, making her briefly consider some sort of concession of cordon perimeter. There was always a margin she could shave off, after all.  
唉，被封锁区域周边的状况真是乱得一塌糊涂。这已经不是市中心第一次发生战斗了，但这次使徒的规模非同寻常，其毁灭地点又恰好位于几条主要道路的交汇处，历史上这里曾是城市中最繁忙的交通枢纽之一。就连美里平日通勤的路线也遭遇了严重的交通堵塞，让她不禁考虑是否要稍微缩小封锁范围。毕竟，总有一些余地可以削减。

Of course, she instantly rejected it and came back to the Geofront. She'd have to take the outer ring road to get home, assuming she would be able to go home today at all.  
当然，她立刻否决了这个念头，回到了地底都市。她只能选择绕行外环路回家，前提是今天她还能回家的话。

Ritsuko thrust the papers in her hand at Misato. "Not like we need you for the testing process anyway. All you have to do is read the results."  
律子将手中的文件塞给美里。“反正测试过程也不需要你。你只需要读一下结果就行了。”

Misato walked over to her and accepted the papers. She felt a momentary confusion at the dizzying array of graphs and numbers, but these kinds of reports usually followed a certain structured format to help people like Misato, so she was able to find the numbers she was supposed to check soon enough.  
美里走到她身边，接过文件。面对令人眼花缭乱的图表和数字，她一时感到困惑，但这类报告通常遵循某种结构化格式，以帮助像美里这样的人，所以她很快就能找到需要核对的数字。

"Let's see... Asuka's at 42. Shinji's at 35, Rei's at 31. So they're back to their old numbers."  
“让我看看... 明日香是 42，真嗣是 35，绫波是 31。所以他们回到了原来的数值。”

"No. In Shinji and Asuka's cases, they're slightly lower than average for the three weeks prior to the battle, with Shinji's drop being particularly noticeable."  
“不。在真嗣和明日香的情况下，他们的数值略低于战斗前三周的平均值，真嗣的下降尤为明显。”

Misato shrugged and handed the report back to Ritsuko.  
美里耸了耸肩，将报告递还给律子。

"He's the one who was injured the most. That must have affected him."  
“他受伤最重，这肯定影响了他。”

Then Misato frowned. "Or maybe there was no real decrease in the synchronization rate. Maybe you were right and the readings from the last battle were actually an error, and this one is just normal numbers."  
随后美里皱起眉头。“或者也许同步率并没有真正下降。可能你是对的，上次战斗的读数实际上是个错误，这次只是正常数值。”

Misato was barely finished when Ritsuko shook her head.  
美里刚说完，律子就摇了摇头。

"Wrong." "错了。"

"About what?" "关于什么？"

"First, the Evangelion synchronization is not affected by physical factors, at least not as significantly as this. There must be other factors at play in Shinji and Asuka's rates declining. Probably psychological. And second, you were right."  
“首先，EVA 的同步率不受生理因素影响，至少不像这次这么明显。真嗣和明日香的同步率下降肯定有其他因素在起作用。很可能是心理因素。其次，你刚才说得对。”

_But you just said I was wrong,_ Misato almost complained, when Ritsuko scratched her head. Her confusion must have preceded her words.  
“但你刚才说我错了。”美里几乎要抱怨了，这时律子挠了挠头。她的困惑显然先于她的话语。

"I'm sorry, I haven't slept. I'm saying nonsense. What I meant is, you were right then, and wrong now. The inspection showed no device failure or program error, so the synchronization rate observed during the last battle was likely real, not an observational error. So the result today means the largest drop we've seen in just one day."  
"对不起，我还没睡。我说的都是胡话。我的意思是，你那时是对的，现在错了。检查显示没有设备故障或程序错误，所以上次战斗中观察到的同步率很可能是真实的，并非观测误差。因此，今天的结果意味着我们在一天之内看到了最大的下降。"

"Huh." "嗯。"

Ritsuko picked up a clipboard that was lying on a nearby monitor and began to clip the reports in. She tilted her head slightly in Misato's direction, her gaze emotionless.  
律子拿起放在附近显示器上的一个剪贴板，开始整理报告。她微微向美里那边侧了侧头，目光毫无情感。

"Operations Director Katsuragi. You may want to seriously reconsider your management policy regarding the two pilots."  
作战部长葛城。您可能需要认真重新考虑一下对两位驾驶员的管理政策。

A cold wind blew through Misato's chest. "I don't understand what you're talking about."  
一阵寒风穿透了美里胸膛。“我不明白你在说什么。”

Ritsuko didn't even bother to respond to that, just snapping the clip shut with a click and turning to walk away. As she passed by, she whispered in a low voice.  
律子连回应都懒得回应，只是咔哒一声合上夹子，转身离开。经过时，她低声耳语道。

"He knows." "他知道了。"

Left alone in the cold observation booth, Misato thought for a long time about what Ritsuko's words meant, about the numbers she'd seen and what they meant, about what was happening in her house, about what she should have done and what she should not have done.  
独自一人留在冰冷的观察室里，美里长时间地思考着律子的话意味着什么，她看到的数字及其含义，她家中正在发生的事情，以及她本该做和不该做的事情。

She didn't have any answers about any of them. Misato shook her head and shifted her feet as the hangar's lights went out one by one with a loud crackle and the light that had been streaming through the reinforced windows vanished, plunging the room into total darkness.  
对于这些，她没有任何答案。美里摇了摇头，挪动着双脚，随着机库的灯光一个接一个地发出响亮的噼啪声熄灭，透过加固窗户照射进来的光线也消失了，房间陷入了完全的黑暗。

Despite thinking she might have been late, Misato moved toward the pilots' locker room. It was probably her last chance to talk to them in person today, after all. She had no idea what to tell them, to be honest, but she knew she wanted to see their faces now.  
尽管觉得自己可能已经迟了，美里还是朝着驾驶员更衣室走去。毕竟，这可能是她今天最后一次亲自和他们说话的机会了。老实说，她不知道该对他们说些什么，但她知道自己现在想看看他们的脸。

Some staff greeted her in the hallways and elevator, and some of them spoke to her as if they had some business, but Misato tuned them out. After some time she found herself standing in front of the door.  
走廊和电梯里有些工作人员向她打招呼，有些人似乎有事要谈，但美里都没理会。过了一会儿，她发现自己站在了门前。

Misato was about to enter when she realized she didn't know if they had finished changing, and that she didn't need to go in since the kids would come out as soon as they were done. But as she stood there waiting, she also realized that they might have already left headquarters and the locker room could be empty, making a fool of her, standing in front of an empty room.  
美里正要进去，却意识到她不知道他们是否已经换好衣服，而且她也不必进去，因为孩子们一换好就会出来。但当她站在那里等待时，她也意识到他们可能已经离开了总部，更衣室可能空无一人，让她像个傻瓜一样站在空房间前。

_You could just ask if anyone is inside, stupid.  
你完全可以直接问里面有没有人，笨蛋。_

Misato realized that she really was sleep deprived. Clearing her throat, she opened her mouth, but a sharp, shrill voice from inside shut her up.  
美里意识到自己真的是睡眠不足。她清了清喉咙，正要开口，但屋内传来一阵尖锐刺耳的声音，让她闭上了嘴。

"So what's the problem if you're not ashamed?!"  
“既然你不觉得羞耻，那有什么问题？！”

It was Asuka's voice, followed by Shinji's, which sounded a little too muffled to be heard from beyond the door.  
那是明日香的声音，紧接着是真嗣的，听起来有些过于沉闷，似乎是从门外传来的。

"... not ... you ...ly misled them!"  
"... 不是 ... 你 ...误导了他们！"

"Ah, so that's the problem? Lying?"  
"啊，所以问题出在这儿？撒谎？"

Misato was sure Shinji had replied, but she couldn't hear a word of it this time. She was torn between two options; go in now and dive into the fight, or step back because it wasn't right to eavesdrop. But she couldn't move forward or backward, as if her feet were nailed to the spot. Then Asuka's voice burst out again.  
美里确信真嗣回答了，但这次她一个字也没听到。她陷入了两难境地：是现在进去投入战斗，还是退后一步，因为偷听是不对的。但她既无法前进也无法后退，仿佛双脚被钉在了原地。随后，明日香的声音再次爆发出来。

"... could always make it not a lie, then!"  
“……总能把它变成不是谎言的！”

What are they even talking about? Why are they fighting? Misato thought for a moment, and then realized that this time she couldn't hear Shinji's voice, muffled or not. Or Asuka's voice either, for that matter. Either their voices had dropped down to a level she couldn't hear, or a silence had fallen. She had no way of knowing. She tilted her head toward the door a little and strained her ears to hear. Nothing.  
他们在说什么？为什么争吵？美里思索片刻，然后意识到这次她听不到真嗣的声音，无论是模糊的还是清晰的。明日香的声音也一样。要么是他们压低了声音，她听不见，要么是陷入了沉默。她无从得知。她微微侧头向门靠近，竖起耳朵倾听。什么也没有。

Because of the prolonged silence, Misato was startled when Shinji's voice ripped it to shreds. She almost yelped in surprise but restrained herself at the last moment.  
由于长时间的沉默，当真嗣的声音突然打破寂静时，美里吓了一跳。她几乎要惊叫出声，但在最后一刻克制住了自己。

"What am I to you, Asuka?"  
“我对你来说算什么，明日香？”

Asuka's reply was quick, sharp, and her tone was odd. "What?"  
明日香的回答迅速而尖锐，语气有些古怪。“什么？”

Shinji didn't say anything after that, or if he did, it was too low for Misato to hear. Probably the former, Misato thought, since Asuka didn't respond either.  
自那之后，真嗣没有再说什么，或者他确实说了，只是声音太低，美里听不见。多半是前者，美里想，因为明日香也没有回应。

Only when silence fell again was Misato able to take a cautious step backward, as if a spell had been lifted from her feet.  
直到再次陷入沉默，美里才小心翼翼地后退了一步，仿佛她脚上的咒语被解除了。

After leaning against the wall opposite the door for a moment, waiting for the kids, Misato shook her head and silently walked toward the nearest elevator.  
在门口对面的墙边靠了一会儿，等待着孩子们，美里摇了摇头，默默地走向最近的电梯。

### Chapter 17 Hard thing

Sorry for the longer than usual gap. Blame Larian  
抱歉，间隔比平时长了一些。都怪拉里安。

Lazily, Dr. Ritsuko Akagi picked up the report paper, only to panic for a moment when she realized she couldn't make out a single word of the text. She moved her hand closer to the laptop monitor, thinking it might be the lighting that was the problem, but the document remained illegible. It took her a moment to realize that she wasn't wearing her glasses. Sighing, she reached over to the bedside table. She felt the soft texture of the glasses case after rummaging through the clutter.  
懒洋洋地，赤木律子博士拿起报告纸，却在意识到自己一个字也看不清时慌了一瞬。她将手移近笔记本电脑的屏幕，心想可能是光线问题，但文件依旧难以辨认。片刻后，她才意识到自己没戴眼镜。叹了口气，她伸手去床头柜摸索。在杂物中翻找后，她感受到了眼镜盒柔软的质感。

_What a way to remind you you're old_, she thought as she put on her glasses. She increased the resolution of all of her work computers a long time ago so she didn't have problems reading anything on them, but she couldn't do the same with standard-format printouts.  
真是提醒你老了的绝佳方式，她戴上眼镜时心想。她很久以前就把所有工作电脑的分辨率调高了，以免阅读困难，但她无法对标准格式的打印件做同样处理。

_How old was I when my mother was the age I am now?  
我现在的年龄，母亲当时是几岁呢？_

As she thought so, she heard a groan from behind. The sheets rustled. A hand, rough and warm, came to rest lightly on her back dimple. Ritsuko shifted her hips slightly forward to get away from it, smiling. The laptop on her lap wobbled a bit.  
正当她这么想着，背后传来一声呻吟。床单窸窣作响。一只粗糙而温暖的手轻轻搭在她背部的酒窝上。律子微微向前挪动臀部，试图避开，脸上露出微笑。放在腿上的笔记本电脑微微晃动。

"Woke up? It's a little early."  
“醒了？还早呢。”

A snort. "Someone's making a lot of noise. With a computer on, even."  
一声轻哼。“有人在制造噪音。还开着电脑。”

"Someone gave me quite a tight deadline." Ritsuko glanced at the part of the report she meant to check, then shifted her eyes to the monitor.  
“有人给了我一个相当紧迫的截止日期。” 律子瞥了一眼她本打算检查的报告部分，然后将目光移到显示器上。

At the periphery of her vision, she saw Gendo Ikari pick up a bowl of water from the nightstand next to the bed and pour it into a glass. The sound of running water, then the sound of a gulp. It was quite ravenous and loud. It was understandable. He sweated quite a bit, after all.  
在她视野的边缘，她看到碇源堂从床头柜上拿起一碗水，倒进一个玻璃杯中。水流声，接着是吞咽声。那声音相当急切且响亮。这可以理解。毕竟他出了不少汗。

Gendo cleared his throat. "I remember someone not liking it when I brought work to this place."  
碇源堂清了清喉咙。“我记得有人不喜欢我把工作带到这个地方来。”

It was Ritsuko's turn to snort. "Who was it who threw me a completely unexpected and extremely urgent task?"  
轮到律子嗤之以鼻了。“是谁突然给我扔了个完全意料之外且极其紧急的任务？”

The futon rustled, then his beard brushed against Ritsuko's bare skin as he tilted his head over her shoulder.  
被褥窸窣作响，随后他的胡须轻拂过律子裸露的肌肤，他侧过头，下巴搭在她的肩上。

"So this is the second letter."  
“原来这是第二封信。”

Ritsuko gave a small nod. "Yes. Technical advice. As you ordered."  
律子微微点头。“是的，技术建议。正如您所命令的。”

The kind that would not blow up the entire base, or cause another disaster on a similar scale. The differences between it and all the faulty advice letters that were sent before, and the ones that were written and prepared to send even now, were so minuscule and subtle that very few people would even notice them. Ritsuko would have plenty of wiggle room even if things went awry. It was a level of deception that required a total and perfect mastery of the subject, quite impossible to even attempt for anyone but the highest living authority of Project E herself. Ritsuko was quite proud of the whole thing, honestly.  
这种建议不会导致整个基地爆炸，也不会引发类似规模的灾难。它与之前所有错误建议信之间的差异极其微小且微妙，以至于几乎没有人会注意到。即使事情出了差错，律子也有足够的回旋余地。这种程度的欺骗需要对主题有完全且完美的掌握，除了 E 计划的最高权威本人外，几乎不可能有人能尝试。老实说，律子对此颇为自豪。

A warm breath tickled Ritsuko's ear as Gendo opened his mouth.  
随着源堂张开嘴，一股温暖的气息轻拂过律子的耳畔。

"The entire Nevada branch. Three thousand five hundred people. An Evangelion and a pilot. How does it feel to have the power to decide their lives and deaths?"  
"整个内华达分部。三千五百人。一台 EVA 和一名驾驶员。拥有决定他们生死的力量，感觉如何？"

Without a conscious effort to do so, her throat let out a 'hah' sound. "I'm not the one who decides which of the two letters we send."  
她不自觉地喉咙发出一声‘哈’。“决定发送哪封信的并不是我。”

"But your input has weight. Quite a lot, I'd even say."  
“但你的意见举足轻重。甚至可以说，相当重要。”

_I doubt that_, she didn't say, not giving voice to the thought that immediately popped into her head. She didn't really want to open that can of…whatever foul things.  
我怀疑这一点，她没有说出口，没有将脑海中立刻冒出的念头说出来。她并不真的想打开那罐……无论是什么恶心的东西。

"I'm not sure this is wise."  
“我不确定这是明智的。”

The answer came back sooner than she expected, in a nonchalant tone. "I agree. That's why I ordered you to have both options ready, so we can choose one when we're sure."  
回答比她预料的来得更快，语气漫不经心。“我同意。所以我命令你准备好两个选项，这样当我们确定时就可以选择一个。”

"I'm questioning the need for the second option."  
"我在质疑第二个选项的必要性。"

They had already argued about this before, and she had a feeling that this would be a repeat of that pointless discussion, contrary to his words about the weight of her advice. But Ritsuko couldn't help herself.  
他们之前已经为此争论过，她有种预感，这将是那场无谓讨论的重演，尽管他曾提到她的建议的重要性。但律子忍不住。

"As I told you before, the emergence of two production models with the Super Solenoid Engine would add too much uncertainty to the situation. That was the whole point of the sabotage in the first place, wasn't it? The sabotage _you_ ordered."  
"正如我之前所说，两个配备超级螺线管引擎的生产型号的出现，会给局势带来太多不确定性。这正是最初破坏行动的目的，不是吗？你下令的破坏行动。"

Theoretically, both Unit-03 and Unit-04 were to be delivered to Tokyo-3 NERV headquarters as soon as they were built in the United States. Just as the Berlin branch sent Unit-02 as soon as it was pronounced ready for combat. However, NERV's two North American branches and everything that was happening there were strongly influenced by the U.S. government, and no one, including Gendo and Ritsuko, believed the U.S. government would meekly follow through with the prior agreements without raising some kind of ruckus. The construction of those Units on U.S. soil itself was the result of the American government's strong insistence after their late entrance to the project.  
理论上，Unit-03 和 Unit-04 在美国的建造完成后应立即运往东京-3 的 NERV 总部。正如柏林分部在 Unit-02 宣布战斗准备就绪后立即发送一样。然而，NERV 的两个北美分部及其在那里的所有活动都受到美国政府的强烈影响，包括碇源堂和赤木律子在内，没有人相信美国政府会温顺地遵守先前的协议而不制造一些麻烦。这些在美国本土建造的 Unit 本身就是美国政府在项目后期加入后强烈坚持的结果。

To be fair, NERV's budget wasn't exactly transparent. The titanic amount of funding it required to operate, which was almost solely dependent on taxes collected from UN member countries, would be cause for complaint anywhere. In addition, the top-secret nature of the organization meant that the public couldn't even witness a return on their investment. These factors, combined with the poor economic conditions in the United States, meant that a political storm was brewing that even SEELE wouldn't be able to fully rein in.  
公平地说，NERV 的预算并不完全透明。其运营所需的巨额资金几乎完全依赖于联合国成员国征收的税款，这在任何地方都可能引起抱怨。此外，该组织的绝密性质意味着公众甚至无法看到他们的投资回报。这些因素，再加上美国糟糕的经济状况，意味着一场政治风暴正在酝酿，即使是 SEELE 也无法完全控制。

Both Congress and the executive branch have been raising inflammatory rhetoric against NERV for months now. The previous administration had held a much more favorable attitude towards NERV in comparison to its successor. It was probably why the two Eva units had been built in the first place, and why things were so troublesome now.  
国会和行政分支几个月来一直在对 NERV 发表煽动性言论。与继任者相比，前一届政府对 NERV 的态度要友好得多。这大概就是为什么最初会建造两台 EVA 单位，以及为什么现在事情变得如此棘手。

Gendo gave a small snort. "That doesn't mean we shouldn't prepare for the best-case scenario."  
碇源堂轻哼一声。“这并不意味着我们不应该为最佳情况做准备。”

Ritsuko looked back at Gendo, frowning. She was met with calm, indifferent eyes. She chewed her lip slightly.  
赤木律子回头看向碇源堂，皱起眉头。她面对的是一双平静而冷漠的眼睛。她微微咬了咬嘴唇。

"That scenario never existed. Even if it did, any possibility disappeared the moment they passed the resolution."  
"那个情景从未存在过。即便存在，当他们通过决议的那一刻，任何可能性都消失了。"

"We already dealt with that."  
"我们已经处理过那件事了。"

"Oh sure we did. Instead of two US pilots, it's one US pilot and one from us. Quite a compromise."  
"哦，当然处理了。不是两个美国飞行员，而是一个美国飞行员和一个我们的飞行员。真是个大妥协。"

"Both of them went through the Marduk Institute screening. The nationality of the pilot is totally meaningless anyway. We picked a German one to appease the German government back then. Is she in any way under her country's influence?"  
"他们俩都通过了马杜克研究所的筛选。驾驶员的国籍根本无关紧要。我们当初选择了一个德国人，只是为了安抚德国政府。她会受到她国家的任何影响吗？"

The fact that he was spouting that Marduk bullshit, even though they were alone, almost dumbfounded Ritsuko.  
尽管他们独处一室，他还在大谈特谈马杜克的那套鬼话，这让律子几乎哑口无言。

"You mean we disappeared an American employee and made up all those pretty letters and stamped them and sent them to ourselves. And yes, it doesn't matter what nationality the pilot is. Like you said, we already have a German one and it doesn't matter in the slightest. What matters is the fact that the American government is blatantly demonstrating its intent to intervene in the operation and ownership of the Evangelions, and that the Committee, which supposedly has complete control of the core bureaucracy and mass media, was unable to nip the attempt in the bud and has instead been forced to make a compromise. Or -"  
"你是说我们消失了一个美国雇员，然后编造了那些漂亮的信件，盖上章，寄给自己。没错，驾驶员的国籍确实无关紧要。就像你说的，我们已经有了一位德国驾驶员，这根本无关痛痒。重要的是，美国政府公然展示其干预福音战士运作和所有权的意图，而本应完全掌控核心官僚机构和大众传媒的委员会，却未能及时阻止这一企图，反而被迫做出妥协。或者——"

"Or," Gendo quietly interrupted. "The old men of the Committee weren't forced at all, and it was their choice to either push or allow such pressure to build in the American political zeitgeist. If so, then the compromise, while ostensibly a political compromise between the U.S. government and the UN Human Instrumentality Committee, would be a warning from SEELE to me."  
"或者，" 碇源堂平静地打断道，"委员会的老人们并非被迫，而是他们选择推动或允许这种压力在美国政治氛围中积累。如果是这样，那么这个妥协，虽然表面上看起来是美国政府与联合国人类补完委员会之间的政治妥协，实际上是对我发出的 SEELE 的警告。

Ritsuko studied his face wordlessly. Gendo slowly backed away from her and leaned against the backrest of the bed. "I'm not unaware of such factors, doctor. And I know what you're thinking. We think in a similar way. After all, we're kindred souls."  
律子默默地审视着他的脸。碇源堂缓缓地从她身边退开，靠在床背上。"我并非不了解这些因素，博士。我也知道你在想什么。我们的思维方式很相似。毕竟，我们是同道中人。

A sneer. As if saying he thought he had her wrapped around his finger.  
一丝嘲讽。仿佛在说他以为自己已经把她牢牢掌控在手心。

Or the smile of a co-conspirator. As if saying you and I alone share a secret that would make the world tremble.  
或是共谋者的微笑。仿佛在说，你我之间独享的秘密，足以让世界为之颤抖。

Feeling something weird in her stomach, Ritsuko tilted her head slightly. Whenever she saw that specific face from him she wanted to ask which it was. She wanted to kiss those lips and have her answer. And she wanted to slap herself for being foolish.  
丽苏诺感到胃里一阵异样，微微歪了歪头。每当她看到他那特定的表情，她就想问个究竟。她想亲吻那些唇，得到答案。同时又想扇自己一巴掌，觉得自己太傻。

"Is that so? Then I suppose you're looking for the possibility of additional resources for the exact reason I'm thinking of right now. Am I right, Commander?"  
“是吗？那么我想你正在寻找额外资源的可能性，正是我现在所考虑的原因。我说得对吗，指挥官？”

Gendo's smile froze. It was a subtle change, neither visible to the untrained eye nor lingering, but Ritsuko saw it all. And she found it rather amusing. Did he really think he could hide something so obvious?  
源堂的微笑凝固了。这一变化细微至极，未经训练的眼睛难以察觉，也未曾停留，但律子尽收眼底。她觉得颇为有趣。他真的以为能隐藏如此明显的事情吗？

Then the moment passed, and his face relaxed. Gendo raised a hand and stroked his beard slowly.  
随后那一刻过去了，他的表情放松下来。源堂举起一只手，缓缓地抚摸着胡须。

"You can never have too much cannon fodder."  
“炮灰永远不嫌多。”

Ritsuko shrugged. 律子耸了耸肩。

"Especially if you have reason to doubt the performance of the cannon fodder you already have."  
“特别是当你有理由怀疑你现有的那些炮灰的表现时。”

As always with this specific topic, Gendo's face showed that he didn't want to discuss it any further, but as always with this specific topic, Ritsuko felt a weird urge to continue.  
一如既往地，在这个特定的话题上，源堂的脸色表明他不想再继续讨论下去，但同样地，在这个特定的话题上，律子却感到一种奇怪的冲动想要继续说下去。

"I implied some things to Captain Katsuragi. She's been taking some action ever since. With a little help from our side, we might be able to make what she's doing a permanent measure. Maybe that could save us from this whole American trouble."  
“我向葛城队长暗示了一些事情。她从那时起就开始采取行动了。如果我们稍加协助，或许能让她的举措成为长久之计。也许这样能让我们摆脱这场美国风波。”

"Ah, the captain. I forgot to promote her for her performance in the last battle. She earned it, I think. Might as well do it tomorrow."  
“啊，那位队长。我忘了因为她上次战斗的表现而提拔她。我认为她当之无愧。不如明天就办吧。”

Changing the subject was so uncharacteristic of him. Ritsuko frowned slightly when he turned his eyes to the water glass and spoke again.  
改变话题对他来说很不寻常。当他再次转向水杯并开口时，赤木律子微微皱起了眉头。

"There is no such thing as a permanent measure. It's not possible to do something more than what the captain is already doing. Or are you suggesting we should retire one of them? Surely that's not possible. We still need every pilot. And when they become obsolete with the Dummy Plug completed, nothing will matter. We could keep them together. Or separate them. Or send one of them away. Or send both of them away."  
"没有什么措施是永久不变的。队长已经在做的事情，我们不可能做得更多。还是说，你建议我们应该让他们中的一个退休？这显然不可能。我们仍然需要每一位驾驶员。等到 Dummy Plug 完成，他们变得过时了，一切都不再重要。我们可以让他们在一起，或者分开，或者送走其中一个，或者两个都送走。"

Silence fell. Gendo didn't say anything else, and Ritsuko didn't have anything to add either. She went back to her document. For a moment, only the sound of the keyboard clacking echoed in the room. Then Gendo lay down again, rustling the futon.  
沉默降临。Gendo 没有再说什么，Ritsuko 也没有什么要补充的。她回到她的文件上。一时间，房间里只有键盘敲击声回荡。随后，Gendo 再次躺下，窸窣地整理着被褥。

It had only been drizzling when Shinji left school. He'd had to stay late for cleaning duty, and had been anxiously glancing through the window at the darkening clouds the whole time. By the time he'd gotten two blocks away, the droplets had thickened into a full-scale downpour. He'd ducked into a convenience store, completely drenched. The signs were there - cloudy all day, umbrellas everywhere in school. His prayers for the rain to hold off were in vain.  
当真嗣离开学校时，只是细雨蒙蒙。他因为打扫值日而耽搁了，整个过程中都焦虑地透过窗户望着越来越暗的云层。等他走了两个街区远，雨滴已经变成了倾盆大雨。他躲进一家便利店，浑身湿透。迹象早已显现——整天阴云密布，学校里到处都是雨伞。他祈求雨停的愿望落空了。

He wanted to blame the weather forecast, but Tokyo-3's was renowned for its accuracy, being calculated by the MAGI. Honestly he wasn't sure if he checked it this morning. He probably didn't. With all the things occupying his mind the past few days, he didn't have the mental capacity for such frivolities.  
他想把责任推给天气预报，但东京-3 的预报以其准确性著称，是由 MAGI 系统计算的。说实话，他不确定自己今早是否查看了天气预报。他大概没有。过去几天里，他的脑海中充斥着太多事情，没有心思去关注这些琐事。

_Did she get inside in time, or is she as wet and miserable as I am?  
她及时进屋了吗，还是像我一样湿透了，感到难受？_

Shinji thought about it for a moment, then snorted, pulling the SDAT earbuds out of his ears. He didn't need to worry about Asuka. She'd probably gone straight to headquarters as soon as classes were over. Just like she did for the past few days.  
真嗣想了一会儿，然后哼了一声，从耳朵里取出 SDAT 耳机。他不需要担心明日香。她很可能一下课就直奔总部了。就像她过去几天一直做的那样。

It was 'probably' because Shinji didn't have any idea what she was doing. It had been like that since Monday. After the frustrating and messy fight in the locker room, they didn't talk. At all. They ignored each other at home and at school. They went to school separately. Asuka would disappear, and then come home late at night with Ms. Misato. She at least ate the bentos he left for her on the kitchen counter, but that was the extent of their communication.  
这'大概'是因为真嗣根本不知道她在做什么。从周一就开始这样了。在更衣室那场令人沮丧又混乱的打斗之后，他们就没再说过话。一点都没有。在家和学校都互相无视。他们各自上学。明日香会消失不见，然后深夜和美里小姐一起回家。她至少会吃掉他留在厨房台面上的便当，但这就是他们交流的全部了。

It was so awkward when they were in the same room, or even so much as made eye contact. And as the days went by and those occasions piled up, Shinji's resentment did too.  
当他们在同一个房间里，甚至只是眼神接触时，都显得异常尴尬。随着日子一天天过去，这些场合不断累积，真嗣的怨气也越积越深。

Shinji had never been in a situation like this before, so he had no idea what to do. The Shinji of old would cut ties with people over much smaller disputes than this. A turning of his back. Immediate no contact. Shinji and the other person would go their separate ways. He would cease to acknowledge the other person, as if they never existed.  
真嗣以前从未遇到过这种情况，所以他不知道该怎么办。过去的真嗣会因为比这小得多的争执就与人断绝关系。转身离去。立即断绝联系。真嗣和那个人会各走各的路。他会停止承认对方的存在，仿佛他们从未存在过。

Shinji lost several 'friends' like that through kindergarten and elementary school. Dramatic and cathartic reconciliations like he had with Misato and Toji were exceptions, not the norm. In fact, such a thing never happened before in his life. No matter the size, or whose fault it was, or the severity of the conflict, he would cut contact at the slightest sign of discord. Better to avoid the pain. Better to not risk it by addressing things. And he never regretted it. Sometimes on a sleepless night, the thought of a missed chance would creep into his mind, but that was it.  
在幼儿园和小学期间，碇真嗣就这样失去了好几个‘朋友’。像他与美里和阿薰那样戏剧性且具有治愈性的和解是例外，而非常态。事实上，在他的人生中，这样的事情从未发生过。无论冲突的大小、责任在谁、严重程度如何，只要有一丝不和的迹象，他就会切断联系。避免痛苦总比冒险去解决问题要好。而且他从未后悔过。有时在失眠的夜晚，错过机会的想法会悄悄潜入他的脑海，但也就仅此而已。

This time was different. Shinji wanted to make this work. He didn't want to be uncomfortable around Asuka.  
但这次不同。真嗣希望这次能成功。他不想在明日香身边感到不自在。

But how? 但该怎么做呢？

He had all but given up on initiating conversation. This whole mess was her doing, and she wasn't trying to talk to him either. It was as if she was expecting him to be the one to come up with something and appease her.  
他几乎已经放弃了开启对话的念头。这一切混乱都是她引起的，而她也没有试图和他交谈。仿佛她在期待他能主动想出些什么来安抚她。

It was not like he didn't give her anything, though. Shinji had provided Asuka with a question.  
不过，他并非什么都没给她。真嗣已经向明日香提出了一个问题。

_What was he to her?  
他对她而言算什么？_

To be honest, he didn't know what kind of answer he hoped for. It was something that he just blurted out in the heat of the moment. Maybe he shouldn't expect a proper answer, then. It wasn't fair to demand an answer to a question he hadn't even really meant to ask in the first place.  
老实说，他并不知道自己期待什么样的回答。那只是他在一时冲动之下脱口而出的话。或许那时他不该期待一个恰当的答案。要求回答一个他原本就没打算真正提出的问题，这并不公平。

But then again, even if he didn't know what exactly he was expecting, he might have had a vague idea, maybe a hope of a sort. The fact that he didn't want a simple answer like 'my boyfriend' was something they both knew. Asuka's non-answer was, in a way, an answer all on its own.  
但话说回来，即便他不清楚自己究竟在期待什么，也许心中还是有些模糊的想法，某种希望吧。他们都知道，他并不想要一个简单的答案，比如“我的男朋友”。绫波的未作回答，在某种程度上，本身就是一种回答。

Shinji sighed, feeling his chest tighten, as was always the case whenever he'd thought about this topic. He didn't expect something he had thought so strong and absolute would be so easily shaken. He wondered why he had ever thought that way in the first place. It's not like they'd known each other for very long at all.  
真嗣叹了口气，每当想到这个话题，他的胸口总会感到紧绷，这已成为常态。他没想到自己曾认为如此坚定和绝对的事情会如此轻易动摇。他不禁疑惑，自己当初为何会那样想。毕竟，他们相识的时间并不长。

A date. Kisses. And what they almost did that night in the kitchen. The warmth of a hug. Tender feelings. A naked body under the pale moonlight. It all felt like a fever dream now.  
一次约会。亲吻。还有那晚在厨房差点发生的事。一个温暖的拥抱。温柔的情感。一具赤裸的身体在苍白的月光下。这一切现在都像是一场高烧中的梦。

To distract himself from his increasingly uncomfortable thoughts, Shinji turned his attention to the shelf in front of him. Plastic umbrellas, things he could use maybe three times at best before breaking, were so ridiculously expensive. They were probably trying to rip off people like him who had no other options. _How many salmon filets could I buy with that money,_ he wondered.  
为了转移自己越来越不舒服的思绪，真嗣把注意力转向面前的架子。塑料雨伞，他最多可能用三次就会坏掉的东西，价格却贵得离谱。他们大概是在敲诈像他这样别无选择的人。他想知道，这些钱能买多少份三文鱼片。

As he picked up the cheapest and the flimsiest-looking transparent umbrella, he heard a familiar voice from behind.  
当他拿起最便宜、看起来最脆弱的透明雨伞时，他听到身后传来一个熟悉的声音。

"Shinman! Thought you went home. What are you doing here?"  
"真嗣！还以为你回家了呢。在这儿干嘛呢？"

Shinji flinched. Then he turned around, forcing a smile. He didn't want to be seen looking crestfallen by anyone, much less Toji Suzuhara.  
真嗣微微一颤。随后他转过身，强挤出一个笑容。他不想被任何人，尤其是铃原东治看到自己垂头丧气的样子。

Toji was standing in the narrow aisle between the shelves. He was wearing a school uniform instead of his usual tracksuit, something that was happening more and more often lately, to everyone's surprise. In one hand he held a plastic bag full of something Shinji couldn't see, and in the other, an umbrella. Shinji scratched the back of his head and was about to open his mouth when a girl with pigtails popped out from around the corner. Shinji stifled the groan that almost escaped.  
东治站在书架间的狭窄过道上。他穿着校服，而不是平时常穿的田径服，这种变化最近越来越频繁，让大家都感到惊讶。他一只手提着一个塑料袋，里面装着真嗣看不清的东西，另一只手则拿着一把伞。真嗣挠了挠后脑勺，正要开口时，一个扎着双马尾的女孩从拐角处冒了出来。真嗣差点没忍住发出一声叹息。

_Of course she's with him. She's half of the reason why I have no one to talk to these days.  
她当然和他在一起。她是我这些天没人可聊的半个原因。_

"Hello, Toji. Class Rep."  
“你好，东治。班长。”

"Hey, Ikari. Cleaning duty, right?"  
“嘿，碇。值日打扫，对吧？”

Shinji nodded awkwardly, as Toji looked around. "Where's Soryu? Can't see her."  
真嗣尴尬地点了点头，而东治环顾四周。“惣流呢？看不到她。”

Shinji felt his throat tightening, making him unable to say anything. The smile on his face seemed to freeze in place. It was the Class Rep who saved him. She grabbed her umbrella by the middle and tapped Toji's head with the handle.  
真嗣感到喉咙发紧，让他无法说出任何话。他脸上的笑容似乎凝固了。是班长救了他。她抓住伞的中段，用伞柄轻轻敲了敲东治的头。

"No one lives here, I see. I just said Ikari was on cleaning duty today."  
“看来这里没人住。我只是说今天碇是值日生。”

"Don't do that!" Toji pushed the umbrella away, irritated. "So what? She could have waited, you know. She's his girlfriend, isn't she?"  
"别那样！" 冬二推开伞，显得有些恼火。"那又怎样？她本可以等的，你知道的。她不是他的女朋友吗？"

"Maybe she had a reason not to! How do you know?!"  
"也许她有她的理由！你怎么知道？！"

"Well, I would've still waited if it was me."  
"嗯，如果是我的话，我依然会等。"

"Easier said than done." "说起来容易做起来难。"

"What?! Did you forget I waited _ages_ for you to get out of that class rep meeting or whatever today?  
"什么？！你忘了我今天为了等你开完那个班长会议之类的东西等了多久吗？"

"Oh, great, you're getting loud again. You're so embarrassing to be with, you know that?!"  
"哦，又来了，你又开始大声嚷嚷了。跟你在一起真是丢脸，你知道吗？！"

That was smooth, derailing the argument the moment it went against her, Shinji thought. But it really was a bit loud, too. Shinji cleared his throat. He never liked loud, obnoxious couples.  
真是一招妙棋，一察觉到辩论对她不利就立刻转移话题，真嗣暗想。不过，这声音也确实有点大。真嗣清了清嗓子。他向来不喜欢吵闹又令人讨厌的情侣。

"Asuka's been busy lately. She's got a lot of work to do at NERV headquarters."  
“最近明日香挺忙的。她在 NERV 总部有很多工作要做。”

He wasn't sure if that was a good thing or not. Maybe if they were forced to see each other more they might be forced to reconcile. Or they'd have even more serious fights. He wasn't sure which.  
他不确定这是好事还是坏事。也许如果他们被迫更多地见面，可能会被迫和解。或者他们会爆发更严重的争吵。他无法确定会是哪一种。

And on top of that, Ms. Misato had suddenly started taking Asuka away. It was obvious that she knew something was wrong between them and was intervening. The problem of Asuka was already overwhelming enough to him, so he tried his best to consciously avoid this subject, but neither of them would tell him anything about what they did so late at night. Not that he'd even bothered asking in the first place. Had Asuka told Ms. Misato anything? About herself? About _them?_ Wondering too hard about what Ms. Misato knew and what she didn't always made him want to rip his hair out and scream.  
不仅如此，美里小姐还突然开始把明日香带走。很明显，她察觉到他们之间出了问题并介入了。明日香的问题已经让他应接不暇，所以他尽量有意识地避开这个话题，但他们俩谁也不肯告诉他深夜里做了什么。他一开始也没打算问。明日香有没有告诉美里小姐什么？关于她自己？关于他们？过分纠结美里小姐知道什么、不知道什么，总让他想扯头发尖叫。

"Huh, I thought something happened between you and Soryu recently. In class, you guys don't-"  
“嗯，我以为你和惣流最近发生了什么事。在班上，你们俩不——”

"What are you doing here, Ikari? Buying an umbrella, I guess?"  
“碇，你在这里做什么？买伞吗？”

Shinji nodded, feeling something akin to relief at the class rep's obvious intervention. But at the same time, it raised another suspicion. How much did _she_ know? She must have sensed something too, to stop Toji from embarrassing Shinji with uncomfortable inquiries. Did Asuka talk to her about their fight? Or even more? He hoped not.  
真嗣点点头，对班长明显的干预感到一种类似解脱的情绪。但与此同时，这又引发了他另一层疑虑。她究竟知道多少？她必定也察觉到了什么，才会阻止东治让真嗣难堪的尴尬盘问。是明日香和她谈过他们的争吵吗？还是更严重的事？他希望不是。

"Uh, yeah. I forgot to bring one."  
“呃，是的。我忘了带。”

The class rep shook her head. "It's a waste of money. It's what, 300 yen? I bet you could buy three pieces of Norwegian salmon filet if they're on sale. Four, if you're lucky. That's a whole breakfast for three people."  
班长摇了摇头。“这是浪费钱。要 300 日元吧？我敢打赌，如果打折的话，你可以买到三份挪威三文鱼片。运气好的话，四份。足够三个人吃一顿早餐了。”

"Nah, that's not enough for breakfast," Toji said, shrugging, before Shinji could respond.  
"不，这可不够当早餐，" 真嗣还没来得及回应，东治就耸了耸肩说道。

"You eat breakfast?" "你吃早餐？"

There was pure awe in the class rep's voice, making Shinji almost laugh out loud. Toji was incensed, though.  
班长的话里充满了纯粹的敬畏，让真嗣差点笑出声来。但东治却气得不行。

"Of course I do! Why wouldn't I?" Then his whole body shrank about a degree. "Well, that was before my sister got hospitalized. We got no one to cook at home these days..."  
“当然有！怎么会没有呢？”接着他整个人似乎缩了一点点。“不过，那是在我妹妹住院之前。现在家里没人做饭了……”

Shinji felt a lump in his throat. Toji's sister. He almost forgot.  
真嗣感到喉咙哽住了。是啊，东治的妹妹。他差点忘了。

The class rep didn't even respond to that, looking almost disgusted. She turned back to Shinji. "Take this."  
班长甚至没有回应，看起来几乎有些厌恶。她转回对真嗣说：“拿着这个。”

Shinji reflexively accepted the thing that was thrust at him. An orange umbrella, wrapped up, slightly damp. Compact enough to fit in a schoolbag.  
真嗣本能地接过了递给他的东西。一个橙色的雨伞，包裹着，略带湿气。小巧到可以放进书包。

Toji spoke first, because Shinji was standing bewildered.  
托吉先开口了，因为真嗣正站在那里发愣。

"What are you going to do? If you give him yours?"  
“你打算怎么办？如果你把你的给他？”

"Someone will have to walk me home, I guess."  
"我想得有人送我回家了。"

"But your house is on the opposite side of the train route."  
"但你家在铁路线的另一边。"

Horaki pointed at the plastic bag that was in Toji's hand, then left the store. Toji blinked. Shinji followed almost reflexively.  
Horaki 指了指 Toji 手中的塑料袋，然后离开了商店。Toji 眨了眨眼。Shinji 几乎是下意识地跟了上去。

The air was damp and cool. It was raining harder than before. The storefront awning was still up, right in front of the convenience store's entrance, giving them some protection from the elements, but a strong wind sent the raindrops flying nearly sideways to splash them. Shinji hurriedly opened the umbrella he was given and placed it over Class Rep's head.  
空气潮湿而凉爽。雨势比之前更大了。便利商店门前的遮阳篷依旧撑着，正好挡在入口前，为他们提供了些许庇护，但一阵强风将雨滴几乎横吹过来，溅在他们身上。真嗣急忙打开收到的伞，撑在班长头顶。

They stood side by side in the damp gray air, with the sound of rain in the background. It was awkward. Horaki was close to Asuka, and apparently had known Toji for some years, too, but she didn't have anything one might call a connection with Shinji. To Shinji, standing together with such a person, shoulders almost touching, was something unthinkable.  
他们并肩站在潮湿的灰蒙蒙空气中，雨声在背景中回响。气氛尴尬。洞木与明日香关系亲近，显然也认识东治多年，但她与真嗣之间似乎并无任何称得上联系的东西。对真嗣而言，与这样一个几乎肩并肩的人站在一起，简直难以想象。

_Now that she's close with Toji, does that mean I'll have to deal with her more than before?  
既然她和东治走得近了，那是不是意味着我得比以前更多地应付她？_

That was a weird notion. This whole situation was weird and unbelievable, to be honest. Himself and Asuka. The class rep and Toji. All of it. He clenched and unclenched the hand that was holding the umbrella.  
这想法真是奇怪。老实说，整个情况都很奇怪且难以置信。他和明日香。班长和真嗣。所有的一切。他紧握又松开那只握着伞的手。

Then his thoughts went to Toji's sister. He wondered how she was. He realized that maybe he should have visited her at least once, after befriending Toji. He wondered if Toji and his sister cared. If Toji secretly thought less of him for ignoring his sister.  
然后他想到了真嗣的妹妹。他不知道她现在怎么样了。他意识到也许自己至少应该在和真嗣成为朋友后去探望她一次。他不知道真嗣和他妹妹是否在意。真嗣是否在心里暗暗看轻他，因为他忽视了他的妹妹。

Shinji's shoulder, which the umbrella didn't cover well, quickly got wet. He couldn't do anything about it. The umbrella wasn't that large. Shinji tilted it slightly in the direction of Horaki so she wouldn't get wet.  
真嗣的肩膀很快就被雨水打湿了，伞没能很好地遮住那里。他对此无能为力。这把伞并不大。真嗣稍微倾斜伞，让班长不会被淋湿。

It was the class rep who broke the awkward silence. "How are you feeling, Ikari? You've gone through so much in so little time recently, haven't you? Maybe I should have let you off the cleaning duty roster. Along with Asuka, I guess."  
是班长打破了这尴尬的沉默。“碇，你最近经历了那么多，感觉怎么样？或许我应该让你免去清洁任务，还有明日香也是。”

Toji's sister completely forgotten for a moment, Shinji stopped his lips from forming a bitter smile. Now that he thought about it, so much _had_ happened lately. Shinji glanced in Horaki's direction, then back to the front again, embarrassed by her gentle smile.  
一瞬间，东治的妹妹被完全遗忘了，真嗣止住了嘴角苦笑的冲动。现在想来，最近发生了太多事。真嗣瞥了一眼班长，然后又尴尬地看向前方，她的温柔微笑让他有些窘迫。

"Yeah. No, I mean, it's okay. The cleaning duty. I can do that."  
“嗯，不，我是说，没关系。清洁任务我可以做的。”

Shinji had stopped wearing the compression bandages as of yesterday. Whenever his arms throbbed again, he felt cold sweat breaking out all over his body, but that was rare now.  
从昨天起，真嗣就不再缠着压迫绷带了。每当手臂再次抽痛时，他感到浑身冷汗直冒，但这种情况现在已十分罕见。

He could see Horaki giving a small nod in the periphery of his vision. And with that, silence descended once again. Shinji glanced in the direction of the store. A middle-aged man was standing at the counter, shouting and pointing at the clerk. The glass wall made it impossible to make out his words. Toji was standing behind the man, arms crossed. When their eyes met, Toji shook his head.  
他瞥见班长在视野边缘微微点头。随之，寂静再次降临。真嗣朝店铺方向望去，一位中年男子正站在柜台前，大声嚷嚷并指着店员。玻璃墙使得他的话语难以辨清。托吉站在男子身后，双臂交叉。当他们的目光相遇时，托吉摇了摇头。

The class rep spoke again.  
班长再次开口。

"Ikari, if you don't mind me asking... How long have you and Asuka... been like that?"  
"碇君，如果可以的话...我想问一下，你和明日香...已经那样多久了？"

_Like_ what? Shinji almost replied, but stopped himself at the last moment. It had been four days now since Asuka, in her stupid quest to win some stupid argument, had exposed their relationship without consulting him, and not only that, she'd told the whole class a lie about their intimate life. Aside from the fact that he had a hard time forgiving Asuka for that, he also was at the end of his patience. He was tired of being the subject of knowing stares and whispers. It was not the first time he had been the subject of unwanted attention at this school, but this time was not the same.  
那样是哪样？真嗣差点脱口而出，但最后一刻还是忍住了。自从明日香为了赢得那场愚蠢的争论，未经他同意就公开了他们的关系，已经过去四天了。不仅如此，她还向全班撒谎，编造了关于他们亲密生活的谎言。除了难以原谅明日香这一点外，他也已经忍无可忍了。他厌倦了那些意味深长的目光和窃窃私语。在这所学校，他不是第一次成为不受欢迎关注的对象，但这次情况不同。

And Horaki's question was vague enough that it could go either way: how long had they been dating or how long had they been sleeping together. Swallowing past the lump in his throat, he reminded himself that he was talking to Hikari Horaki, the class representative. She might ask Asuka, secretly and timidly, about such a thing, but there was no way she would throw that kind of question at Shinji.  
而洞木的问题足够模糊，既可以指他们交往了多久，也可以指他们同居了多久。他咽下喉咙里的硬块，提醒自己正在和班长洞木光交谈。她可能会偷偷地、胆怯地问明日香这样的问题，但绝不可能直接向真嗣提出这种问题。

"It hasn't been that long."  
"其实也没过去多久。"

"Well, it's not like she's been here that long, either. It's really hard to wrap my head around it sometimes. Whenever I see her transfer entry in the class log I'm genuinely surprised."  
"嗯，她在这里的时间也不长。有时候真的很难理解。每次看到她在班级日志里的转学记录，我都感到非常惊讶。"

Shinji nodded, his eyes still looking forward. She was right. Perhaps even more than she realized. One moment Shinji felt like he'd known Asuka for years, and the next she was a complete stranger to him.  
真嗣点点头，目光依旧直视前方。她说得没错，或许比她意识到的还要多。这一刻真嗣感觉自己好像已经认识明日香好几年了，下一刻她又成了一个完全陌生的人。

"Hey, Ikari." "嘿，碇。"

Horaki's voice was so quiet it was almost a whisper, and Shinji, who was going through everything that had happened between him and Asuka in his head, almost didn't hear her.  
堀崎的声音轻得几乎像是耳语，而正在脑海中回放他与明日香之间发生的种种的 Shinji，差点就没听到她的话。

"...Yeah?" "...嗯？"

"I looked through school rules, and..."  
"我查了学校的规章，然后……"

Shinji glanced back at Class Rep, feeling something was off in her tone. The oddness of the topic, coupled with the way she was blushing and averting her gaze, made Shinji very uneasy. His stomach started to churn. "Rules?"  
"真嗣瞥了一眼班长，感觉她的语气有些不对劲。这个奇怪的话题，加上她脸红和避开目光的样子，让真嗣感到非常不安。他的胃开始翻腾。“规则？””

Horaki nodded quickly. 班长迅速点头。

"Yeah. The ban on dating was repealed long before we got in, so the only sign of it being a thing is the punishment records, all of them several years old."  
“是的。禁止恋爱的规定在我们入学前很久就被废除了，所以现在唯一能证明它存在过的痕迹就是那些惩罚记录，全都是几年前的了。”

Shinji couldn't stop the small groan from escaping. The class rep began to talk faster. "But, there's still the, uh, public indecency rule, and the wording of it is very vague... I guess that's the intention but... anyway, the rule is so open to interpretation, and what I'm worrying about isn't even contestable when caught, I think, so, eh..."  
真嗣忍不住发出了一声轻微的呻吟。班长开始加快语速。“但是，还有那个，呃，公共场所猥亵的规定，它的措辞非常模糊……我想这就是故意的……总之，这条规定解释空间很大，而我担心的事情一旦被抓到，恐怕连争议的余地都没有，我觉得，呃……”

Shinji forced his mouth open. Honestly, he couldn't believe he was having this conversation with Hikari Horaki of all people. Maybe her prior question was about...he didn't want to think about it. "What exactly are you worrying about? Can you be specific, please?"  
真嗣强迫自己张开嘴。老实说，他简直不敢相信自己居然在和班长洞木光讨论这种话题。也许她之前的问题是关于……他不想去想。“你到底在担心什么？能具体点吗？”

The class rep's face flushed. Even the freckles on her cheeks become bright, bright red. "You two... won't do it at school... would you? Please."  
班长的脸涨得通红。连她脸颊上的雀斑都变得异常鲜红。“你们俩……不会在学校里做那种事吧……会吗？请不要。”

Shinji got the impression that she didn't mean holding hands or kissing or anything like that.  
真嗣有种感觉，她说的不是牵手或接吻之类的事情。

_We might not even do that ever again at this rate, in private or in public.  
照这样下去，我们可能再也不会那样做了，无论是在私下还是公开场合。_

Shinji chewed on his lip at the sudden thought. "You don't need to worry about that."  
真嗣突然想到这一点，咬了咬嘴唇。“你不必担心那个。”

His voice sounded way lower than he intended. He could see Horaki's shoulders stiffening. Shinji forced a smile, trying to diffuse the situation before it became even more awkward than it already was.  
他的声音听起来比他预期的要低沉得多。他能看到长崎的肩膀僵硬起来。真嗣强挤出一个笑容，试图在情况变得更加尴尬之前缓和气氛。

"It's not like there's a place we could do it, even if we wanted to."  
“又不是说我们想做就能找到地方。”

At that, Horaki covered her mouth, giggling. "Oh, there are. More than you think. Reading through the punishment record was a blast, you know. They once caught a couple doing it in a cleaning tools locker during recess!"  
听到这话，长崎捂住嘴，咯咯笑了起来。“哦，有的。比你想象的要多。翻看惩罚记录真是太有趣了，你知道吗。他们曾经在课间休息时抓到一对情侣在清洁工具柜里做那事！”

Shinji remembered the steel lockers that dotted the hallways of the school. Brooms and cleaning supplies and stuff in them. Was there even room to move around inside? Just how?  
真嗣记得学校走廊上散布着那些钢制储物柜。里面放着扫帚、清洁用品之类的东西。里面真的有空间移动吗？到底是怎么做到的？

And of course, the thought naturally led him to imagine himself and Asuka inside one such locker. Shinji gritted his teeth, shaking his head. "That's crazy."  
当然，这个念头自然而然地让他想象起自己和明日香在其中一个储物柜里的情景。真嗣咬紧牙关，摇了摇头。“这太疯狂了。”

Just as the class rep opened her mouth, smiling, the convenience store's door opened. Both of them turned towards it.  
就在班长张嘴微笑时，便利店的门打开了。两人都转向了那边。

"Sorry! Made you wait a while, heh. Some crazy old motherfucker tried to get a refund for some shit he already ate and wouldn't let the clerk do his job!"  
"抱歉！让你久等了，嘿。有个疯疯癫癫的老家伙非要退他已经吃掉的东西，还不让店员好好工作！"

Horaki crossed her arms. "I told you to watch your language, Suzuhara! That's not how you talk about your elders!"  
Horaki 交叉双臂。"我告诉过你注意言辞，铃原！不能这样谈论长辈！"

"Why? Not like he could hear me from there!"  
"为什么？他又听不到我在这儿说的话！"

She shook her head, turning to Shinji.  
她摇了摇头，转向真嗣。

"You're going home, right? To the station?"  
“你要回家了，对吧？去车站？”

Shinji nodded. 真嗣点了点头。

"We're going to hang out around here for a bit. Guess we should part ways here. Don't forget to return the umbrella tomorrow, okay?"  
“我们打算在这附近逛逛。看来我们该在这里分开了。别忘了明天把伞还回来，好吗？”

"Thank you, Class Rep." "谢谢你，班长。"

As Toji unfolded his umbrella, Horaki leaned slightly toward Shinji and whispered.  
当冬二打开他的伞时，班长微微向真嗣倾斜并低声说道。

"Give her some time, Ikari."  
"给她点时间，碇。"

The unexpectedness of it stunned him. He had no answer for that.  
这突如其来的情况让他愣住了。他对此无言以对。

Toji waved his hand. "Let's go! See you tomorrow, Shinji!"  
真治挥了挥手。“走吧！明天见，真嗣！”

Shinji couldn't help but smile awkwardly and nod. Without looking back, Horaki slipped under Toji's umbrella and the two of them began walking away, side by side..  
真嗣不禁尴尬地笑了笑，点了点头。没有回头，洞木悄悄钻进了真治的伞下，两人并肩开始离去。

And then they started to argue about something when they went barely ten steps away from Shinji, waving their hands wildly. Shinji felt his mouth curving upward at the sight, only to freeze at the next moment as something cold filled his heart.  
然后他们刚离开真嗣不到十步远，就开始为某事争论起来，手舞足蹈。真嗣看到这一幕，嘴角不由得上扬，但下一刻，一股寒意填满了他的心，让他僵住了。

Horaki, like the last time she visited his home, was interfering without knowing anything. He hadn't even asked for help, and frankly, he felt it was presumptuous. She was close to Asuka, yes, but she barely knew Shinji. She might have been right last time, now that he thought about it, but it was probably by pure chance. She didn't really know that much about what happened between him and Asuka back then, and he doubted Asuka would have confided in her about what happened between them recently. Horaki was making a lot of assumptions. She was perceptive enough, but the only real clue she had was the mess Asuka made at school on Monday. She didn't know what happened at their home. It made her arrogant. Obnoxious. Trying to offer cheap, feel-good advice without knowing the full story. She was meddlesome. It was unpleasant. He didn't like it.  
就像上次她来他家时一样，洞木在没有了解任何情况的情况下就插手干预。他甚至没有寻求帮助，坦白说，他觉得这很自以为是。她确实和明日香关系密切，但她对真嗣几乎一无所知。现在回想起来，她上次可能是碰巧说对了，但她其实并不了解当时他和明日香之间发生了什么，他怀疑明日香也不会向她透露最近他们之间发生的事情。洞木做了很多假设。她足够敏锐，但她唯一的真正线索是周一明日香在学校制造的混乱。她不知道他们家里发生了什么。这让她变得傲慢。令人讨厌。试图在不了解全部情况的情况下提供廉价、让人感觉良好的建议。她爱管闲事。这让人不快。他不喜欢这样。

But Shinji realized that there was something else on his mind. After a moment, he realized that he was jealous of Toji and the class rep. Of how happy they seemed. While he, for reasons he didn't know or understand, couldn't even talk to his girlfriend.  
但真嗣意识到他心里还有别的事情。过了一会儿，他意识到自己嫉妒了，嫉妒东治和班长，嫉妒他们看起来多么幸福。而他，出于某种自己不知道也不理解的原因，甚至无法和女朋友交谈。

He knew how petty and bitter that was. One of them was the only friend left to him, and the other was a kind classmate who helped him whenever she could, even when he didn't ask, even when she didn't have any obligation to do so. And their happiness hadn't come from taking something away from Shinji and Asuka.  
他知道自己这样既小气又苦涩。其中一个是他仅剩的朋友，另一个是善良的同学，总是在他能帮忙的时候伸出援手，即使他没有请求，即使她没有义务这样做。而他们的幸福并非来自从真嗣和明日香那里夺走什么。

_I'm such a spiteful piece of trash.  
我真是个心怀怨恨的废物。_

Shinji sighed, shaking his head. Raindrops plopped in a small puddle near his feet.  
真嗣叹了口气，摇了摇头。雨滴在他脚边的小水坑里扑通作响。

There was a test scheduled at HQ this evening. It was going to be the first test since the last time they fought.  
今晚总部安排了一次测试。这是自上次战斗以来的首次测试。

_If I lose to Asuka again, and have a lower synchronization rate than her for the second time in a row, would she talk to me again? Like the way she tried to talk to me in the locker room last time, as if nothing had happened? And if that happens, should I just go along with it?  
如果我再次输给明日香，连续第二次同步率低于她，她还会像上次在更衣室那样跟我说话吗？就像什么都没发生过一样？如果真是那样，我应该顺其自然吗？_

It didn't feel right. Asuka acting as if nothing had happened as soon as the test results came back in her favor only managed to make him angry. Maybe almost as much as he'd been over what had happened at school. No, now that he thought of it, he was definitely more angry over her actions after the test.  
这感觉不对劲。测试结果一出来对明日香有利，她就表现得好像什么都没发生过，这让他更加愤怒。也许几乎和学校发生的事情一样让他生气。不，现在想来，他对她测试后的行为肯定更加愤怒。

But what if the consequence of expressing that anger was another fight? A repeat of the last few days, or worse, an even more severe strain on their relationship?  
但如果表达这种愤怒的后果是另一场争吵呢？重复过去几天的情景，或者更糟，他们的关系更加紧张？

Conversely, what would be the reward of just letting her have her way?  
相反，如果只是让她随心所欲，会有什么回报呢？

Only then did he realize that he had faced a similar choice with Asuka already.  
直到那时，他才意识到自己已经面临过与明日香类似的选择了。

Kensuke's letter. 健介的信。

A choice between keeping his dignity or bending to Asuka's demands.  
是在尊严和屈服于明日香的要求之间做出选择。

The possible outcomes he faced then were also similar to those he faced now.  
那时他面临的可能结果与现在所面临的也颇为相似。

On the one hand, a crisis. Painful. Unjust. On the other, unimaginable pleasure. The kind that would melt his body and mind.  
一方面是危机，痛苦且不公。另一方面则是难以想象的愉悦，那种能让他身心俱融的感觉。

And Shinji wanted the pleasure. He wasn't sure if he could refuse it when the time came. If Asuka tried to do something half-hearted and stupid, like trying to strike up an awkward conversation in the locker room or something, he would be able to push her away, like he did before. But if she came to his room at night, as she had in his dream, he would definitely crumble.  
而真嗣渴望那份愉悦。他不确定当那一刻来临时自己能否拒绝。如果明日香试图做一些半吊子又愚蠢的事，比如在更衣室里硬着头皮展开尴尬的对话之类的，他还能像以前那样推开她。但如果她像梦里那样在夜里来到他的房间，他肯定会彻底崩溃。

Shinji remembered what he had seen, what he had almost tasted, on that fateful night. The heat and softness hugging his body.  
真嗣记得那个决定性的夜晚他所见到的，几乎尝到的。那股温暖和柔软包裹着他的身体。

He imagined himself lying with Asuka in his bed. Asuka moaning and clinging to him, just like she did in the HQ lounge. With her eyes full of desire. Wanting him.  
他想象着自己与明日香躺在他的床上。明日香呻吟着，紧紧依偎着他，就像她在总部休息室里那样。眼中充满渴望。想要他。

It felt infinitely better than this cold war they were doing, the price be damned.  
这感觉比他们正在进行的这场冷战要好得多，代价什么的都无所谓了。

_And that's all I can think of, even now. Her body.  
即便到了现在，我满脑子也只有这个。她的身体。_

Shinji squeezed his eyes shut. The patter of rain mingled with the sound of the argument from inside the store, filling his darkened world.  
真嗣紧闭双眼。雨点的滴答声与店内争吵的声响交织在一起，填满了他的黑暗世界。

---

"Aren't they supposed to have artificial rain or something here?"  
“这里不是应该有人工降雨之类的吗？”

Asuka wiped her brow with the back of the hand that wasn't holding the watering can. The cotton gloves she was wearing were damp from doing the exact same thing so many times. And the motion of raising her arm sent a bead of sweat tracking down the length of it until it reached her side The sensation made her shudder. It wasn't just her face. Her armpits were clammy, sweat was constantly trickling down her back, and her whole body felt gross and disgusting.  
明日香用没拿喷壶的那只手擦了擦额头。她戴的棉手套因为同样动作重复太多次已经湿透了。而抬手的动作让一滴汗珠顺着胳膊滑到身侧，这感觉让她打了个寒颤。不光是脸，她的腋下也湿漉漉的，汗水不停地顺着背脊流下，整个身体都感觉黏糊糊的，令人恶心。

Rain was pouring on the surface above, and the Geofront, relying on skylight windows for lighting, was gray and gloomy too. Not a single raindrop from above was touching this underground cavern, but somehow the whole place was as hot and humid as a sauna.  
地表上大雨倾盆，依靠天窗采光的 Geofront 也显得灰暗阴沉。上方没有一滴雨水能触及这个地下洞穴，但不知为何，整个地方却热得像桑拿房一样潮湿。

The impracticality of her uniform pissed her off. It had been summer for fifteen years. She would have thought they'd have perfected the design by now. The flowy skirt and short sleeves were great, she could give them that, but the shoulder straps on the skirts were unnecessarily cumbersome and acted as an extra layer on her upper body, and both the blouse and skirt were made of polyester, which was _bad_ when you sweated. Really bad.  
她对制服的不实用感到恼火。夏天已经持续了十五年，她本以为设计早就该完善了。飘逸的裙摆和短袖还不错，这点她承认，但裙子的肩带过于累赘，成了上身额外的负担，而且无论是衬衫还是裙子都是涤纶材质，出汗时特别糟糕。真的非常糟糕。

It suddenly occurred to her that maybe, maybe her hairstyle was making the heat worse. Long, flowing hair couldn't be good in this weather, could it? It was something she felt the moment she set foot in this country. But of course, Asuka wasn't willing to compromise even a tiny bit on her precious hair, so the consideration ended right then and there.  
她突然想到，或许，她的发型让炎热更加难耐。在这种天气里，长长的飘逸秀发肯定不合适，对吧？她一踏入这个国家就有这种感觉。但当然，明日香不愿在她的宝贝头发上做任何妥协，所以这个念头也就此打住。

And not like her hair, or her uniform, or even the weather itself was the main culprit behind her gross state. It was the fault of a certain captain who had been summoning her to NERV headquarters as soon as school was over for the past few days.  
而让她如此狼狈的，并非她的发型，或是制服，甚至天气本身。罪魁祸首是某位上校，过去几天一放学就召她去 NERV 总部。

_No, she's a major now.  
不，她现在是少校了。_

Asuka snorted. Yeah,Misato's promotion was one of the reasons she was this sweaty. Asuka tossed the empty watering can to the furrow she'd just finished watering and squatted down on top of the nearest watermelon. It wobbled for a moment but regained its balance soon enough and became a quite nice stool. Mr. Kaji had his back to her, humming some old song she didn't know, and was watering the watermelons. Very slowly. He was barely halfway down his furrow by the time Asuka was done with her own, which was exactly the same length as his. Asuka sighed and wiped the sweat from her brow again.  
明日香哼了一声。没错，美里晋升是让她如此汗流浃背的原因之一。明日香将空水壶扔到刚浇完水的垄沟上，蹲在最近的一颗西瓜上。西瓜摇晃了一会儿，但很快恢复平衡，变成了一张相当不错的凳子。加持先生背对着她，哼着一首她不熟悉的旧歌，正在给西瓜浇水。非常缓慢。当明日香完成自己的垄沟时，他才刚刚浇到一半，而他们的垄沟长度完全相同。明日香叹了口气，再次擦去额头的汗水。

For the past four days, from the day after she fought with Shinji after the sync test, Asuka had been called to headquarters after school, ostensibly to "assist the Operations Director". It was highly suspicious from the get-go. Well, if she was to give it a logical explanation, it wouldn't be impossible that Misato wanted the perspective of a veteran pilot in order to make things easier for them. But somehow Asuka felt Misato wasn't calling her for such things.  
过去的四天里，从她与真嗣在同步测试后争吵的第二天起，明日香放学后就被叫到总部，名义上是“协助作战部长”。从一开始就非常可疑。好吧，如果给她一个合理解释，美里可能是想借助一位资深驾驶员的视角来让事情变得更容易。但不知为何，明日香觉得美里叫她来并非为此。

And it didn't take long for her hunch to be proven right. Misato made no attempt to hide the fact that "assistance" or whatever was just an excuse. Asuka was ordered to clean the office, file some papers, and make coffee. And when there was literally nothing else for her to do, she just sat and chit-chatted with Misato about nothing in particular. And today, Misato was having a party for her special promotion with her staff, so Asuka was dumped on Mr. Kaji like a troublesome child on a babysitter. It was him who brought her to this goddamn watermelon field.  
而她的直觉很快就被证实了。美里丝毫没有掩饰所谓的“帮忙”或任何事情只是个借口。明日香被命令打扫办公室、整理文件、泡咖啡。当实在无事可做时，她就坐在那里和美里闲聊些无关紧要的事。而今天，美里为了庆祝她的特别晋升，要和同事们开派对，于是明日香就像个麻烦的孩子被丢给了加持先生，就像托付给临时保姆一样。正是他带她来到了这片该死的西瓜地。

Normally, Asuka would have scoffed and rejected this whole farce, but for once, she was doing everything she was told with minimal complaints. The moment Asuka pointed out that she knew Misato wasn't calling her because she actually needed help, they would have to discuss the real reason. And Asuka wasn't ready or willing to have such a conversation.  
通常情况下，明日香会嗤之以鼻并拒绝这场闹剧，但这一次，她几乎毫无怨言地照做了。一旦明日香指出她知道美里叫她来并非真的需要帮助，她们就不得不讨论真正的原因。而明日香既没有准备好，也不愿意进行这样的对话。

And it also made Asuka afraid. Because it raised a serious question. Almost frightening. Being Misato's little errand girl was infinitely better than thinking about that dreaded question.  
这也让明日香感到害怕。因为它引出了一个严肃的问题。几乎令人恐惧。做美里的小跑腿总比去思考那个可怕的问题要好得多。

How much did Misato know? What pushed her to resort to this? Was it really just to keep Asuka away from Shinji?  
Misato 究竟知道多少？是什么迫使她采取这种手段？真的只是为了让 Asuka 远离 Shinji 吗？

There was no doubt this was about Shinji. About the tension between him and her, so thick and obvious that Misato couldn't possibly miss it. But how much did she actually know about the reasons behind it?  
毫无疑问，这一切都与 Shinji 有关。他和她之间的紧张关系如此明显，Misato 不可能察觉不到。但她究竟了解多少背后的原因呢？

Asuka understood from the start that she couldn't hide much from Misato. It was something she was fairly aware of. Or at least she thought so. She knew that she didn't really have privacy, with bodyguards always on her tail, and with Misato and Shinji in that small and definitely not sound-proof house. Hiding her relationship with Shinji was such an unrealistic idea, an idea that might only work in some dumb romantic comedy movie or something. So Asuka certainly did not expect Misato to be completely ignorant of their recent conflict.  
Asuka 从一开始就明白，她无法对 Misato 隐瞒太多。这一点她相当清楚，或者说至少她自认为如此。她知道自己在保镖的严密监视下，几乎没有隐私可言，更何况与 Misato 和 Shinji 同住在一个绝对不隔音的小房子里。试图隐瞒与 Shinji 的关系，简直是一个不切实际的想法，或许只有在某些愚蠢的浪漫喜剧电影中才可能实现。因此，Asuka 当然不指望 Misato 对他们的近期冲突一无所知。

But something must have served as a major trigger for Misato to act like this immediately, and in such a disruptful way. Asuka doubted the things she and Shinji showed to Misato - crestfallen faces, extremely reduced talking - were enough to warrant such an extreme reaction.  
但一定有什么重大诱因促使美里立刻以如此颠覆性的方式行动。明日香怀疑她和真嗣向美里展示的——沮丧的面孔、极度减少的交谈——是否足以引发如此极端的反应。

_It's because of our sync rate. Because mine and the Idiot's were all over the place. I shouldn't be surprised. We're the only two good pilots and our values suddenly fluctuated. Of course they're freaking out.  
这都是因为我们同步率的问题。我和那个白痴的同步率一直不稳定。我本不该感到惊讶。我们是仅有的两位优秀驾驶员，而我们的数值突然波动。他们当然会慌乱。_

But what if that wasn't everything?  
但如果那还不是全部呢？

What if Misato knew about what happened that night, and decided that they were crossing the line and needed to be stopped?  
如果美里知道那个晚上发生的事，并决定他们越界了，需要被阻止，那会怎样？

Asuka felt lightheaded whenever she considered that specific possibility. Come to think of it, it wasn't really that impossible that Misato heard about what Asuka had said at school. Maybe she had gotten the wrong impression of what Asuka and Shinji were doing.  
每当想到这种可能性，明日香就感到头晕目眩。仔细想想，美里听到明日香在学校说的话，并非完全不可能。也许她对明日香和真嗣的行为产生了误解。

What was more frustrating was that Asuka couldn't decide what to think about such a scenario. After all, it was completely her choice to do what she did at school. To regret it was to regret her own behavior. To regret it also meant she should regret it if she... did it with Shinji. That didn't sound right. Not at all.  
更令人沮丧的是，明日香无法决定如何看待这样的情景。毕竟，在学校做那些事完全是她自己的选择。后悔就等于后悔自己的行为。后悔也意味着如果她和真嗣...做了那件事，她也应该后悔。这听起来不对，一点也不对。

But what if the consequences of her actions were catastrophic?  
但若她的行为后果是灾难性的呢？

And it was almost disturbing to think that all these topics that were causing her a headache were strictly limited to Misato. The thought of what to do with Shinji, something she also should deal with, made her want to scream out of frustration.  
更令人不安的是，所有这些让她头疼的话题竟然仅限于美里。至于如何处理真嗣，这也是她应该考虑的事情，一想到这个就让她感到无比沮丧，甚至想尖叫。

_What the hell is wrong with him anyway?  
他到底是怎么回事？_

Biting her lip, Asuka turned her gaze to the blue fake horizon in the distance. Through the humid air, she saw the blurry line of a train snaking up the wall of the cavern. Mr. Kaji had almost reached the end of his furrow, a good distance from where he'd been standing earlier, but it looked frustratingly slow in her eyes.  
咬着嘴唇，明日香将目光转向远处那片蓝色的假地平线。透过潮湿的空气，她看到一列模糊的火车蜿蜒爬上洞穴的墙壁。加持先生几乎已经走到了犁沟的尽头，距离他早先站立的地方有一段距离，但在她看来，这进展慢得令人沮丧。

Asuka shook her head and thought of Shinji again. Really. What the hell was wrong with him? There was no way he was still angry over what happened at school. Strictly speaking, she hadn't consulted with him, sure, and it was also true she exaggerated some things a little for a better reaction. But it wasn't as big a deal as it sounded.  
明日香摇了摇头，再次想起了真嗣。真的。他到底怎么了？他不可能还在为学校发生的事情生气。严格来说，她确实没有和他商量过，而且她也确实夸大了一些事情以获得更好的反应。但这并没有听起来那么严重。

With Shinji's suspension over, their relationship was bound to become known anyway. And they actually discussed it the night before they defeated the last Angel. That Asuka had no intention of hiding him. Or being ashamed of their relationship. A lot of things happened that night and the morning that followed, but she definitely told him, sitting on his lap in the cool, dark lounge.  
随着真嗣的停学结束，他们的关系迟早会为人所知。实际上，他们在击败最后一个使徒的前一晚已经讨论过这件事。明日香并没有打算隐藏他，也没有因为他们的关系而感到羞耻。那一晚和第二天早上发生了很多事，但她确实告诉了他，坐在他腿上，在凉爽昏暗的休息室里。

The implication she threw to kids was, well, whatever. Wouldn't it be weird if a girl and a boy who lived in the same house and were dating each other _didn't_ do it? It was a natural thing in Asuka's eyes, nothing to be ashamed of. Well, they failed to actually do it so far, with things unfortunately getting out of hand, but in her eyes it was still only a matter of time.  
她对孩子们的暗示，嗯，无所谓了。如果一个住在同一屋檐下、正在交往的男孩和女孩没有发生关系，难道不奇怪吗？在明日香看来，这是再自然不过的事，没什么好羞愧的。不过，他们至今未能真正做到这一点，事情不幸地失控了，但在她眼里，这不过是时间问题。

_Then why is he angry, then? Is he ashamed of me? Was he hoping to hide that he's dating me?  
那他为什么生气呢？他是不是觉得我丢脸？他是不是希望隐瞒正在和我约会的事实？_

Asuka found herself returning to this question. It was not the first time. Shinji had denied it in the past, but every time Asuka started to believe it for good, she found a reason to doubt it, and this time was no different. And it was a different issue than whether or not Shinji liked her. She was past that point now, at least.  
明日香发现自己又回到了这个问题上。这不是第一次了。真嗣过去否认过，但每次明日香开始彻底相信时，她总能找到怀疑的理由，这次也不例外。而且这与真嗣是否喜欢她不是同一个问题。她现在已经超越了那个阶段，至少是。

Asuka was well aware that she didn't fit the image of desirable girlfriend material most Japanese people held. It was the way she looked, the way she spoke, and the way she acted. She knew she stood out like a sore thumb wherever she went. And she also knew the attention she drew wasn't always positive. Even on her first date, she was stared at by men, women, and children alike. It was understandable, then, for an introverted boy like Shinji to not like it. Maybe that explained why he was angry over last Monday's conversation. Even though he ostensibly denied that he was embarrassed.  
明日香很清楚，自己并不符合大多数日本人心中理想女友的形象。无论是她的外貌、言谈还是举止，都让她显得格格不入。她知道自己无论走到哪里都像是个异类，引人注目，但这种关注并非总是正面的。甚至在第一次约会时，她就感受到了来自男女老少的目光。对于像真嗣这样内向的男孩来说，不喜欢这种关注是可以理解的。或许这也解释了为什么他对上周一的对话感到生气，尽管他表面上否认自己感到尴尬。

And the thought made her angry. Asuka wasn't ashamed of Shinji. There was a time when she thought of him as a nepo kid, not worthy to be her comrade, a second-rate pilot, but not now. He was hers now, and Asuka Langley Soryu never kept mediocre things on her person. She must have made mistakes when she first met him, that was all. And to think of him being ashamed of her when she was like this. The audacity of it.  
这个想法让她感到愤怒。明日香并不为真嗣感到羞愧。曾经有一段时间，她认为他是个靠关系上位的孩子，不配成为她的战友，一个二流驾驶员，但现在不同了。他是她的了，而惣流·明日香·兰格雷从不允许自己身边有平庸之物。她初次见到他时一定犯过错误，仅此而已。而想到他竟然会为她感到羞愧，真是大胆至极。

Second-rate pilot. 二流驾驶员。

Asuka didn't know why her mind suddenly got fixated on that phrase. Maybe it was her subconscious at work; her deep-seated fear that _she_ might be the second-rate one.  
明日香不知道为什么她的思绪突然被那个词所困扰。或许是她的潜意识在作祟；她内心深处对可能成为次等者的恐惧。

_That's ridiculous. 这太荒谬了。_

Asuka shook her head, pushing the absurd thought away. Their sync rates returned to normal. There was the matter of performance issues, but really, it wasn't Asuka's fault that Shinji had more luck than her. Battle was like that by nature; it was complex and full of unexpected variables. It wasn't like it was her fault that, for example, the Angel didn't fall to her assigned station in the last battle. A pilot's true skill, then, should be judged by objective numbers.  
明日香摇了摇头，将这荒唐的想法抛诸脑后。他们的同步率恢复了正常。虽然存在表现问题，但说真的，这并不是明日香的错，因为真嗣比她更走运。战斗本身就是如此复杂且充满不可预见的变数。并不是她的错，比如说，在上一场战斗中天使没有坠落到她指定的位置。因此，一个驾驶员的真正技能，应该由客观数据来评判。

And now that that objective number, the synchronization rate, was back to normal, shouldn't their relationship be back to normal as well? Actually, it took a lot of concession on Asuka's part to try to move on from this issue this easily. As much as she hated to admit it, losing to Shinji in the last battle, coupled with all the random variables that had worked out against her, had really stung her pride deep down. The last attempt at conversation, the one that Shinji escalated into an argument, was Asuka's way of saying that she was willing to let it go. Because she likes him. Because she wants him.  
既然那个目标数值，同步率，已经恢复正常，他们的关系不也应该回归正轨吗？实际上，要让阿斯卡如此轻易地放下这件事，她做出了许多让步。尽管她不愿承认，但在最后一场战斗中输给真嗣，再加上所有对她不利的随机因素，确实深深刺痛了她的自尊。上一次试图进行的对话，真嗣将其升级为争吵，是阿斯卡表达她愿意放下这一切的方式。因为她喜欢他。因为她想要他。

What the hell was wrong with him, then, that he couldn't even accept it. Making a mountain out of a molehill. Picking fights over nothing. Refusing to talk to Asuka for days on end.  
那么，他到底出了什么问题，连这一点都无法接受。小题大做。无事生非。连续几天拒绝与阿斯卡交谈。

Truly, this was too much for her to handle. She had fought and hated many people in her life. Asuka's book was filled with names and their sins. Her stepmother. Teachers from elementary school. Those stupid sorority girls back in university. Asuka had been in all sorts of disputes, sometimes petty, sometimes major, and she was used to hating and being hated. But she was not used to reconciling with someone who was angry with her. She was good at breaking things, but had almost no experience trying to repair them. Trying to do something so foreign to her was more than frustrating.  
说真的，这让她难以承受。她一生中与许多人斗争过，也憎恨过许多人。明日香的书里写满了名字和他们的罪行。她的继母。小学时的老师。大学里那些愚蠢的姐妹会女孩。明日香经历过各种争执，有时是小事，有时是大事，她习惯了憎恨与被憎恨。但她不习惯与对她生气的人和解。她擅长破坏事物，却几乎没有尝试修复它们。去做一件如此陌生的事情，让她倍感沮丧。

Asuka let out a small sigh. When she started dating Shinji, she never imagined herself in a situation like this. What she imagined was the thrill of doing things that were forbidden to her before. Becoming an adult. Having someone who cherished and pleased her. What she got instead was a moody boy prone to unpredictable fits of sulking. A coming-of-age she sabotaged herself. A so-called guardian who couldn't just tell her her true intentions. Mr. Kaji, who probably knew at least as much as Misato, just focusing on his stupid melons instead of helping. And the stupid girl who couldn't say no to those stupid adults and got all sweaty and-  
明日香轻轻叹了口气。当她开始和真嗣交往时，从未想过自己会陷入这样的境地。她原本想象的是那些之前被禁止的刺激事情。成为一个成年人。拥有一个珍爱并取悦她的人。然而，她得到的却是一个情绪多变、动不动就生闷气的男孩。一个她自己搞砸的成年礼。一个所谓的监护人，连真实的意图都不肯告诉她。加持先生，可能至少和美里知道得一样多，却只顾着关注他那些愚蠢的瓜果，而不是帮忙。还有那个愚蠢的女孩，无法拒绝那些愚蠢的大人，弄得满身是汗——

"Wow, are you done already? Did you really water them all?"  
“哇，你已经浇完了吗？真的全都浇了吗？”

Asuka looked up, startled. Mr. Kaji was looking back towards her from the end of his furrow. He was wiping his brow with a towel around his neck while holding the watering can. Asuka nudged her own with the tip of her foot. The blue plastic can, which was large and quite heavier than it looked when full, rattled without a hint of its previous weight.  
明日香抬起头，吃了一惊。加持先生正从他的垄沟尽头回头看向她。他正用脖子上的毛巾擦着额头，手里拿着浇水壶。明日香用脚尖轻轻碰了碰自己的浇水壶。那个蓝色的塑料壶，虽然很大而且装满时比看起来重得多，现在却空空如也，没有一丝之前的重量。

"Of course. I think I did it twice as fast as you, Mr. Kaji."  
“当然。我想我做得比你快两倍，加持先生。”

Mr. Kaji shrugged, walking over to her. "Of course you watered them all. But did you _really_ water them?"  
加持先生耸了耸肩，向她走去。“你当然浇了所有的花。但你真的浇了吗？”

Asuka furrowed her brow, unable to understand. He had a habit of making such cryptic remarks, as if he were an ascetic monk who lived on top of a pillar or something. There were times when she thought it was pretty cool, but not so much now, with her patience running so low.  
明日香皱起眉头，无法理解。他有个习惯，总是说些隐晦的话，好像他是个住在柱子顶上的苦行僧之类的。有时候她觉得这挺酷的，但现在耐心已经所剩无几，就没那么觉得了。

As if he didn't expect an answer, Mr. Kaji didn't even turn to her, walking slowly along the furrow Asuka had watered, occasionally bending at the waist to lift and check the vines..  
仿佛并不期待回答，加治先生甚至没有回头看她，只是沿着明日香浇过水的垄沟缓缓前行，不时弯腰提起藤蔓检查一番。

"You did a pretty good job on the weeding, but the watering…not so much. I even see dry soil here and there."  
“除草做得不错，但浇水……就不怎么样了。我还能看到这里那里的干土。”

Asuka kicked the watering can. It rolled for a moment before hitting a ridge of dirt and stopping. But Asuka didn't get a chance to see it, because the watermelon she was sitting on swayed dangerously from the motion. For a moment she almost fell to the ground, but she was nimble, and she managed to stand up. She had to stagger a few ugly steps forward from inertia, but that was it. Mr. Kaji hurried to her. Asuka shook her head.  
明日香踢了一脚浇水壶，它滚了一会儿撞到土埂才停下。但明日香没机会看到这一幕，因为她坐着的西瓜因这一动作而危险地摇晃起来。有那么一会儿她差点摔到地上，但她身手敏捷，成功站了起来。她不得不踉跄着向前迈了几步，样子颇为狼狈，不过也就到此为止了。加治先生急忙赶向她。明日香摇了摇头。

"It's okay. I'm alright. Not like I-"  
"没事的。我没事。又不是我——"

He walked past her and bent over the watermelon she'd been sitting on just moments ago. There was a sign of genuine distress in his voice.  
他走过她身边，弯腰查看她刚才坐过的西瓜。他的声音中流露出一丝真切的焦虑。

"Have you been sitting on this?"  
"你刚才坐在这上面吗？"

Asuka felt a heat rising on her face. "I'm not that heavy! And I told you, I watered them all. Properly."  
明日香感到脸上热气腾腾。“我才没那么重！而且我跟你说了，我都浇过水了。很仔细的。”

Mr. Kaji rolled the watermelon Asuka was sitting on a bit, shaking his head.  
加治先生轻轻滚动了一下明日香坐着的西瓜，摇了摇头。

"_I think I did it…it looked fine to me…_such things are, well, I'm not saying they're completely meaningless, but they're not the most important part. The most important part is whether the melon is actually watered or not."  
“我觉得我做完了……在我看来一切正常……这种事情嘛，呃，我并不是说它们毫无意义，但它们不是最重要的部分。最关键的是，西瓜到底有没有被浇过水。”

Asuka narrowed her eyes, wondering if he was talking in wise man mode again, or if she was just overreacting to a benign statement. And if it was the latter, why was she feeling that way in the first place?  
明日香眯起眼睛，琢磨着他是不是又在用智者模式说话，还是她对一句无害的话反应过度了。如果是后者，她最初为什么会那样感觉呢？

Trying to push the uncomfortable thoughts away, Asuka asked the question that she blurted out earlier.  
试图驱散那些令人不安的想法，明日香问出了她之前脱口而出的问题。

"Don't they have artificial rain or something in here?"  
“这里难道没有人工降雨之类的吗？”

Mr. Kaji's eyebrows rose. "Artificial rain? Why?"  
加治先生的眉毛一挑。“人工降雨？为什么？”

"Why do we have to bother watering these fruits one by one? If they had the technology to build this underground base, they could make it rain here, I bet. No, come to think of it, it's really weird if they didn't. These melons are just your little hobby, nothing official, sure, but what keeps the forest and the lake alive? Surely they need water from _somewhere_?"  
“为什么我们得一个个给这些水果浇水呢？如果他们有技术建造这个地下基地，我敢打赌他们能让这里下雨。不，仔细想想，如果他们没有这么做，那才奇怪呢。这些瓜果只是你的小爱好，不是正式的，但森林和湖泊是怎么维持生命的？肯定需要从某个地方获取水吧？”

Mr. Kaji chuckled. 加治先生轻声笑了起来。

"Yeah, that's weird, I agree. Never thought about it that way."  
“是啊，这确实奇怪，我同意。从没这么想过。”

Then he said nothing, his eyes fixed on nowhere in particular, an odd smile tugging his mouth. In the air so humid she thought she could swim in it, Asuka licked her lips. They tasted salty. She wished for him to say something, like he did in the hallway to the lounge the other day. Just a little advice. Anything that might help her.  
然后他一言不发，目光凝视着虚无，嘴角勾起一抹奇异的微笑。空气中如此潮湿，她觉得自己仿佛能在其中游泳，明日香舔了舔嘴唇。它们尝起来咸咸的。她希望他能说些什么，就像那天在去休息室的走廊上那样。哪怕是一点点建议。任何可能帮到她的东西。

Mr. Kaji shook his head and pulled his cell phone out of his pocket. "You said there was a test at headquarters this evening, right?"  
加持先生摇了摇头，从口袋里掏出手机。“你说过今晚总部有个测试，对吧？”

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"I think you'll be right on time if you leave now. Can you go alone? I still have some work to finish here."  
"我觉得你现在出发正好能准时到。你能一个人去吗？我这里还有一些工作要完成。"

Asuka swallowed once, then nodded.  
明日香咽了一下，然后点了点头。

### Chapter 18 Hard thing (2)

**Friday, 20:37. NERV HQ Command Center  
星期五，20:37。NERV 总部指挥中心**

"...Therefore my proposal is that we destroy the MAGI system."  
"...因此，我的提议是我们摧毁 MAGI 系统。"

She had half expected it, but she still felt a freezing chill in her stomach at Misato's words. Ritsuko's voice was strained heavily with irritation as she answered.  
她对此已有半分预料，但听到美里的话时，心中仍感到一阵冰冷的寒意。律子回答时，声音因极度烦躁而显得格外紧张。

"Impossible. Destroying the MAGI is tantamount to abandoning HQ."  
"不可能。摧毁 MAGI 无异于放弃总部。"

Misato turned to Ritsuko, the motion carrying a subtle whiff of alcohol with it. She had come straight from the Operations Department party that was commemorating her recent promotion, and it showed. "Then as the head of the Operations Department, I officially request it."  
美里转向律子，动作间隐约带着一丝酒气。她刚从庆祝自己最近晋升的作战部派对赶来，这一点显而易见。“那么作为作战部的负责人，我正式提出请求。”

_And what difference would it make?_ Ritsuko wanted to ask. That was the kind of thing people said in the military or similar bureaucratic apparatuses, where one party would declare, 'I warned you, and I will not go down with you fools if this thing goes south'. Usually, that rhetoric might work as a shock tactic and manage to save the speaker's ass. But not here. They didn't have anyone to inspect the logs and find someone to blame. Postmortem exams weren't a thing here. Within NERV, heads would roll, because failure meant the death of the whole of humanity, a fate much worse than suited-up men from inspection bodies running amok.  
这有什么区别呢？律子想问。这种话通常出现在军队或类似官僚机构中，一方会宣称，‘我警告过你们，如果事情搞砸了，我不会和你们这些傻瓜一起倒霉’。通常，这种说辞可能作为一种震慑手段，设法保全说话者的利益。但在这里不行。他们没有谁会来检查记录，寻找替罪羊。事后审查在这里并不存在。在 NERV，一旦失败，就意味着全人类的灭亡，这种命运远比穿着制服的检查人员失控要糟糕得多。

Ritsuko wasted no time in rebuking her.  
律子毫不犹豫地反驳了她。

"I reject it. This problem is the Tech Department's to solve."  
"我拒绝。这个问题是技术部门需要解决的。"

"Why are you being so stubborn?!"  
"你为什么这么固执？！"

Misato's reaction was completely out of place for an emergency meeting that involved both the Commander and the Vice Commander, but Ritsuko wasn't the least bit surprised. After all, this was not a proper bureaucracy or military. Especially more so for Ritsuko, who had been around to experience the twilight of the GEHIRN days. The newer members, like Maya for example, who made up the overwhelming majority of NERV, might feel differently, but still.  
在这种涉及指挥官和副指挥官的紧急会议上，美里反应完全不合时宜，但律子一点也不惊讶。毕竟，这里不是一个正规的官僚机构或军队。尤其是对律子来说，她经历过 GEHIRN 时代的黄昏。像真嗣这样的新成员，占据了 NERV 的绝大多数，可能会有不同的感受，但依然如此。

"Because it's my mistake. I should be the one who fixes it."  
"因为这是我的错误。我应该负责解决它。"

Misato narrowed her eyes. A silence fell. Neither Gendo nor Fuyutsuki nor any of the others gathered nearby spoke, their eyes all fixed on the bright briefing table. Only Maya, clutching her clipboard like a shield, was acknowledging the situation, openly nervous.  
美里眯起了眼睛。一阵沉默降临。无论是源堂、冬月还是其他聚集在附近的人，他们的目光都紧盯着明亮的简报桌。只有真希波，像拿着盾牌一样紧握着她的文件夹，公开地表现出紧张。

_Am I sounding unreasonable?  
我听起来很无理取闹吗？_

She probably was. It did sound like a line from a period piece made in the Showa era. Ritsuko couldn't imagine herself accepting such logic if it came from someone else in a similar situation.  
她大概是对的。这话听起来确实像是昭和时代历史剧里的台词。如果换作别人在类似情况下说出这种逻辑，赤木律子自己也无法想象会接受。

It didn't matter anyway. Ritsuko had other reasons for being stubborn, and the only person she needed to convince here would take her side anyway, though his reasoning would be different from hers.  
反正这也不重要。赤木律子固执己见有其他原因，而她在这里唯一需要说服的人无论如何都会站在她这边，尽管他的理由与她不同。

And she did have a way to destroy this 'digital' Angel while saving the physical MAGI system itself.  
而且她的确有办法摧毁这个‘数字’使徒，同时保全实体的 MAGI 系统本身。

---

**Same day, 19:11. Building B, NERV HQ  
同日，19:11。NERV 总部，B 栋**

"What? What the hell is this 'autopilot system' that I have to get naked?!"  
“什么？这该死的‘自动驾驶系统’是什么鬼，我还得脱光？！”

Asuka's voice was shrill with anger. The LED light under the CCTV camera glowed red, indicating that the speaker was on. The next moment Akagi's toneless voice rang through the room.  
明日香的声音因愤怒而尖锐。监控摄像头下的 LED 灯发出红光，表明扬声器已开启。下一刻，赤木律子毫无感情色彩的声音在房间内响起。

"The purpose of this test is to attempt harmonics without the aid of the plugsuit and neural connectors. Our technology is advancing even as we speak, and we need to gather all the information we can."  
“本次测试旨在尝试不借助插座服和神经连接器进行谐波操作。我们的技术正在不断进步，我们需要尽可能多地收集信息。”

_And what the hell does entering an entry plug butt naked have to do with this 'autopilot' thing_? Asuka might have asked, but she didn't. She was completely exhausted, both physically and mentally. She quite literally didn't have the stamina to go on a long rant against an adult who wasn't going to listen to her anyway. That's why she ripped off her freshly changed bra, giving up the debate.  
“而且，赤裸裸地进入插入栓和这个所谓的‘自动驾驶’有什么关系？”明日香可能会问，但她没有。她已经筋疲力尽，无论是身体上还是精神上。她实在没有力气去对一个根本不会听她说话的成年人进行长篇大论的抱怨。这就是为什么她撕掉了刚换上的胸罩，放弃了争论。

An air shower awaited her as soon as she exited the locker room, as if to test Asuka's already thin patience. It was when she pushed through all of it and stepped out into the opposite hallway that she saw Shinji.  
她一走出更衣室，就迎来了一个空气淋浴，仿佛在考验明日香本已稀薄的耐心。当她穿过这一切，走进对面的走廊时，她看到了真嗣。

Asuka had already returned to the HQ pyramid and was briefed about today's test by the time Shinji arrived at the Geofront. Even before seeing his face, Asuka was led to a part of HQ she'd never been to before, the B building. The locker rooms and showers that dotted the maze of narrow, long corridors reminded her of the semiconductor factory she'd toured once back in university. And all the dizzying cleaning procedures she had to go through were done alone, without contact with anyone except the voice of Akagi or that certain female operator whose name Asuka still couldn't quite remember, coming from the speakers scattered throughout. She wasn't even aware if Shinji or the First or anyone else was in the same facility, and she didn't bother asking.  
当真嗣抵达地底都市时，明日香已经回到了总部金字塔，并被告知了今天的测试内容。甚至在见到他的脸之前，明日香就被带到了总部的一个她从未去过的地方——B 栋。遍布迷宫般狭窄长廊的更衣室和淋浴间让她想起了大学时参观过的半导体工厂。所有令人头晕目眩的清洁程序她都必须独自完成，除了从遍布各处的扬声器中传来的赤木律子或某个女操作员的声音（明日香仍然记不清她的名字），她没有与任何人接触。她甚至不知道真嗣、第一适格者或其他任何人是否也在同一设施内，她也懒得去问。

And there he was now, across a purely ceremonial partition that barely reached their chests, just as naked as Asuka. He looked to already be in a sulky mood, and when their eyes eventually met, he averted his almost instantly. It made Asuka angry. A lot, the intensity of it surprising even herself.  
而现在，他就站在那里，隔着一道仅及胸口的纯仪式性隔板，和明日香一样赤裸。他看起来已经是一副闷闷不乐的样子，当他们的目光最终相遇时，他几乎立刻就避开了。这让明日香感到愤怒，非常愤怒，连她自己都惊讶于这种情绪的强烈程度。

_He's mad because I refused to fuck him once. He's mad even after he won, beating my sync ratio like that. What a sore winner. He's mad, because I told those peasants at school that he's mine and no one's supposed to touch him.  
他生气是因为我拒绝了一次和他上床。即使他赢了，像那样击败我的同步率，他还是生气。真是个输不起的赢家。他生气，是因为我在学校告诉那些平民，他是我的，谁也不许碰他。_

It sounded too much even to her, but as she stood looking at Shinji's face, stubbornly turned away from her, it started to feel a little more appealing. The events of that fateful night, things she had been pushing out of her mind because they made her feel guilty, began to resurface.  
这话连她自己都觉得太过分了，但当她站在那里，看着真嗣倔强地转过脸去，这开始显得有些吸引力了。那个决定性的夜晚的事件，那些她一直试图从脑海中抹去、因为它们让她感到内疚的事情，开始重新浮现。

_You feel like I pushed you away? Like I trashed your heartfelt confession? What about the time_ you _pushed me away? I confessed in front of the whole class that I like you, so much so that I'll let you do whatever you want with my body, and you're mad at me for it. Torturing me with the silent treatment._  
你觉得我把你推开了吗？像我践踏了你的真心告白一样？那次你把我推开又是怎么回事？我在全班面前坦白我喜欢你，喜欢到可以让你对我为所欲为，你却因此生我的气。用沉默折磨我。

The more she thought about it, the more it seemed to make sense. Yes, Asuka was, in fact, the victim. Even if she had done something wrong, which she didn't, it didn't matter now since Shinji's wrongdoing was worse than hers. There was no reason for her to feel sorry for Shinji, or to feel guilty.  
她越想越觉得有道理。没错，明日香实际上是受害者。即便她做了什么错事——尽管她并没有——现在也不重要了，因为真嗣的过错比她的更严重。她没有理由为真嗣感到抱歉，或是感到内疚。

There was a voice protesting in her head, asking what the hell was wrong with her and was she really out of her mind, but it was getting smaller and weaker by the second. It didn't help that Shinji's eyes, turned away from Asuka, were staring right in the direction of the First.  
她的脑海中有个声音在抗议，问她到底怎么了，是不是真的疯了，但这声音越来越小，越来越弱。更糟糕的是，真嗣避开明日香的目光，正直直地盯着一旁的绫波。

Asuka gritted her teeth, walking up to the barrier gate in front.  
明日香咬紧牙关，走向前面的屏障门。

The rational part of her mind knew that it was highly unlikely that he was staring at the First's ass with Asuka right behind him. That it was probably just his trademark thousand-yard blank stare. From where he was standing, it was natural that his eyes would look that way if he turned away from Asuka. But as usual, there was no comfort for her in cold rationality.  
她理智的那部分明白，他不太可能当着明日香的面盯着绫波的屁股看。那大概只是他标志性的千码空洞凝视。从他站立的位置来看，如果他转头不看明日香，视线自然会朝那个方向。但一如既往，冰冷的理性并未给她带来任何安慰。

Asuka's attention was drawn to the First, since her eyes followed Shinji's. The First was standing quite relaxed, with her typical nonchalant face, looking straight ahead. She didn't seem to notice Asuka's appearance or Shinji's discomfort.  
明日香的注意力被绫波吸引，因为她的目光随着真嗣的视线移动。绫波站得相当放松，带着她一贯的漫不经心的表情，直视前方。她似乎没有注意到明日香的出现或真嗣的不自在。

And Asuka found that so, so, despicable. Before, she would have thought that the First was just a stupid inanimate object, floating around like a duckweed. But after the scene at school, it became worse. That doll wasn't ignoring her surroundings; she was just pretending to. That was still stupid, and the girl herself was still stupid, but that stupidity had gained an extra layer of depth: deceptiveness. Asuka couldn't suppress the disgust that was boiling up in her chest.  
明日香觉得这简直太、太、太可恶了。以前，她可能会认为绫波只是个愚蠢的无生命物体，像浮萍一样飘来飘去。但在学校发生的那一幕后，情况变得更糟。那个玩偶并非无视周围环境，她只是在假装。这依然愚蠢，她本人也依然愚蠢，但这种愚蠢多了一层深度：狡猾。明日香无法抑制胸中翻腾的厌恶感。

And something else caught Asuka's eyes now.  
而此时，另一物吸引了明日香的目光。

_Were they always that large...?  
它们一直这么大吗...？_

The fact that the First's breasts were slightly larger than her own was something Asuka noticed since the first day they'd shared a locker room, but seeing them again in this pale incandescent light reminded Asuka of the fact in a somewhat uncomfortable way. And how flawlessly porcelain her skin was, so pale that her areolas were barely visible under the harsh light like this.  
第一适格者的胸部比自己的稍大，这一点自她们第一天共用更衣室起，明日香就注意到了。但在这种苍白冷光的照射下再次看到，却以一种略显不适的方式提醒了她这一事实。还有她那完美无瑕的瓷白肌肤，如此苍白，以至于在这样刺眼的光线下，乳晕几乎难以辨认。

_She's shorter than me, though. And with her tits already ballooned out, she won't grow in the future that much either. White dwarf. Yeah, that's how she'll end up being.  
她比我矮。而且她的胸部已经膨胀得这么厉害，将来也不会再长多少了。白矮星。没错，她最终就会变成那样。_

Clicking her tongue, Asuka crossed her arms and turned her eyes to check Shinji again. He was still ignoring her. All she could see was the side of his face, the sharp jawline, and the thin neck that ran down from it, connecting to the prominent collarbone and…  
明日香咂了咂舌，交叉双臂，再次将目光投向真嗣。他依然无视她。她只能看到他的侧脸，锐利的下颌线，以及从那里延伸下来的细长脖子，连接着突出的锁骨和……

Asuka's face heated up. She knew she should look away, but for some reason she couldn't. Seriously, why did they even bother with the barriers at all? Why, they could've ordered the Children to stand side by side holding hands and things wouldn't be that much different. She could see everything with just a slight turn of her head, and Shinji, while pretending not to, could definitely see her too. It explained the state of his nether region.  
明日香的脸颊发烫。她知道应该移开视线，但不知为何就是做不到。说真的，他们干嘛还要费心设置屏障呢？干脆让孩子们手拉手站在一起，情况也不会有多大不同。她只需稍微转头就能看到一切，而真嗣虽然假装不在意，肯定也能看到她。这解释了他下半身的状态。

Once, Asuka thought she was beginning to get used to it, as she could always feel its presence whenever they hugged or kissed. That was, of course, until she saw the real thing in the kitchen that night.  
曾经，明日香以为自己开始习惯了，因为她总能在他们拥抱或亲吻时感受到它的存在。当然，直到那天晚上在厨房里亲眼见到实物之前，她都是这么认为的。

She always had a good idea of its size, but that was the only thing she got right. Looking at it, both back then and now, almost repulsed her. It was so grotesquely dark compared to his usual pale complexion. What was worse was the shape. It was so different from the ones Asuka had seen in those American magazines she got her hands on in the University dorm that it was hard to believe they were actually the same body part. Even considering the possible individual differences.  
她一直对它的大小有个大致的了解，但这却是她唯一猜对的地方。看着它，无论是当时还是现在，几乎都让她感到厌恶。与他的平常苍白肤色相比，它是如此畸形地黑暗。更糟糕的是它的形状。与明日香在大学宿舍里弄到的那些美国杂志上看到的截然不同，以至于很难相信它们实际上是同一个身体部位。即便考虑到可能的个体差异。

What caused such a huge discrepancy, Asuka wondered, almost with fascination. Was it because of his race? Size? Age? The first two were congenital traits, but if it was the last, would his thing end up looking like a mushroom, wider on the tip, after a few years? Like the way flowers took some time to blossom? Asuka's imagination ran wild, her growing irritation against Shinji momentarily forgotten.  
是什么导致了如此巨大的差异，明日香几乎带着好奇心想。是因为他的种族吗？大小？年龄？前两者是先天特征，但如果是因为年龄，几年后他的那东西会不会变得像蘑菇一样，顶端更宽？就像花朵需要一些时间才能绽放一样？明日香的想象力肆意奔腾，对真嗣的日益不满暂时被抛诸脑后。

What would it feel like? To have that thing inside her? Whether it be in her mouth or down _there._ Would it wiggle and twitch like she saw in the kitchen? If so, what would that feel like?  
那会是什么感觉？那东西在她体内？无论是嘴里还是下面。它会像她在厨房看到的那样扭动和抽搐吗？如果是的话，那会是什么感觉？

Her body began to respond to her imagination. Thank goodness a girl's body was less obvious when it came to things like this, Asuka thought, as she squeezed her thighs together. How awkward and embarrassing it must be to be standing like Shinji was right now. She couldn't even begin to imagine.  
她的身体开始对她的想象做出反应。幸好女孩的身体在这种事情上不那么明显，明日香想，她紧夹着双腿。像真嗣现在这样站着一定很尴尬和尴尬。她甚至无法想象。

Then Asuka remembered how good it was in the lounge back then. Shinji's hand running all over her body, tickling her at first, making her wonder what the hell was he doing, then driving her absolutely crazy by the end of it. What about that night, in the kitchen? When he licked her neck, she almost fainted. She had to clench her fists hard to avoid melting into a puddle right then and there. When he squeezed her breast it felt like the breath in both lungs was also squeezed out of her, along with all the strength in her body.  
然后明日香想起了那时在休息室的美好感觉。真嗣的手在她全身游走，起初是逗弄她，让她想知道他到底在做什么，最后却让她彻底疯狂。那晚在厨房呢？当他舔她的脖子时，她几乎晕倒。她不得不紧紧握拳，以免当场融化成一滩。当他捏她的乳房时，感觉就像两肺中的呼吸也被挤了出来，连同她全身的力气一起。

And things like that were merely appetizers, not even the main dish. If they felt that good, how much better would the real thing be? And it was her and only her, no one else, that had kicked away that opportunity.  
而这类事情不过是开胃小菜，甚至连主菜都算不上。如果它们已经如此美妙，真正的体验又会好到何种程度？而且，是她，只有她，亲手放弃了那个机会。

The scenario she fantasized about during that fateful night and the morning after resurfaced in her mind. The scenario where Shinji came to her room and begged for her forgiveness, for her love. Back then she had imagined herself rejecting him, crushing his hopes, humiliating him. Even then she thought that maybe she would relent and let him do her if he persisted enough, but it hadn't been her main concern.  
那个决定性的夜晚及次日清晨她幻想的情景再次浮现脑海。在那个场景中，真嗣来到她的房间，恳求她的原谅，渴望她的爱。那时她想象自己拒绝了他，粉碎了他的希望，羞辱了他。即便在那时，她也想过或许自己会心软，如果他坚持不懈，就让他得逞，但这并非她的主要关注点。

But now Asuka felt her focus changing in real-time. If Shinji came to her room at night, as Asuka had imagined he would…  
但现在，明日香感到自己的关注点正在实时改变。如果真嗣像她曾经想象的那样，在夜晚来到她的房间……

If Shinji, like he did in the locker room back on Monday, tried to guilt-trip her with weird, cryptic questions, she'd easily ignore him. But what if he just straight-up jumped on her, skipping words? Like he did in the lounge? With those scary eyes and hard hands? He would even have justification this time, sort of, _pay your debt_ or something like that.  
如果真嗣像周一在更衣室那样，试图用奇怪、隐晦的问题来让她感到内疚，她很容易就能无视他。但如果他直接扑上来，跳过言语呢？就像他在休息室里那样？用那双吓人的眼睛和有力的双手？这次他甚至还有点理由，算是吧，还债之类的。

If such a thing happened, Asuka would, of course, say no and scream and fight against him for a while, but in the end she'd give in. She'd let him do whatever he wanted to her. And when it was all over, she would grab him and let him sleep in her bed before he could run away - Asuka was almost sure that he would run away once the deed was done - and the next morning she would kiss him, as if nothing had happened between them last night and last week. She would talk to him casually. They'd eat breakfast together. Go to school together, hand in hand. Things would be back to normal.  
如果这种事发生了，明日香当然会说“不”，尖叫并反抗他一会儿，但最终她会屈服。她会让他对她为所欲为。而当一切结束后，她会抓住他，让他睡在自己的床上，不让他逃跑——明日香几乎可以肯定，一旦事情完成，他就会逃跑——第二天早上，她会亲吻他，仿佛昨晚和上周他们之间什么都没发生过。她会和他随意交谈。他们会一起吃早餐。手牵手一起去学校。一切都会恢复正常。

It didn't feel right, but at least it would feel better than the war of egos they were doing right now.  
这感觉不对，但至少比他们现在这种自我斗争要好。

But how? Shinji was completely unwilling to take action, it seemed. With the humiliation she suffered after reaching out last time, Asuka had no desire to bend over either. Even dropping hints was almost impossible when they weren't even looking at each other. She couldn't think of any plausible excuse. So how...  
但该怎么做呢？真嗣似乎完全不愿意采取行动。经历了上次伸出手后的羞辱，明日香也不愿再屈尊。连暗示都几乎不可能，因为他们甚至没有看向对方。她想不出任何合理的借口。那么该如何...

Akagi's voice, from a hidden speaker, somewhere in the hallway, broke Asuka's reverie.  
从走廊某处隐藏的扬声器中，赤木律子的声音打断了明日香的沉思。

"Okay. The doors on the opposite side lead to test plugs. Sit in the cockpit and wait for further instruction."  
“好的。对面那些门通往测试驾驶舱。坐进驾驶舱等待进一步指示。”

While Asuka stood still, her mouth open in disbelief, Shinji made a panicked noise from her right. "Ms. Ritsuko...! Are we supposed to walk like this?"  
当明日香呆立原地，嘴巴因难以置信而张开时，真嗣从她右侧发出了慌乱的声音。“律子小姐……！我们得这样走过去吗？”

"Don't worry, the camera will stay off."  
“别担心，摄像头会保持关闭状态。”

Asuka wanted to argue, but she kept her mouth shut as she had before. She really, really was tired of everything.  
明日香本想反驳，但还是像之前一样闭上了嘴。她真的，真的已经厌倦了一切。

---

The test itself was tedious as hell. The usual sync rate tests didn't require much from the pilots either, but they at least produced a result that was directly related to the pilot's performance. For that reason, Asuka had always kept her mind sharply focused, to improve her score. This time was different. Back in the main building, when she was still clothed, she'd been told that today's test wasn't a sync test, that the purpose of it was to gather data for a new technology they were researching. The knowledge killed her desire to focus on this test, knowing that she would not be pitted against Shinji, at least for today. So she was mentally checked out of this whole thing. And it wasn't like they were asking her to do anything anyway.  
这场测试本身无聊至极。通常的同步率测试对驾驶员的要求也不高，但至少能直接反映出驾驶员的表现。因此，明日香总是保持头脑高度集中，以提高她的分数。但这次不同。在主楼时，她穿着衣服就被告知今天的测试不是同步测试，而是为了收集新研发技术的数据。得知今天不会与真嗣较量，她的注意力就消散了。她对这一切都心不在焉，毕竟也没人要求她做什么。

She was connected to a dummy body. She had no idea what kind of metric they were testing her for, but the numbness in her body and the fact that she could only feel her right arm was telling her that this was, indeed, not like the usual Evangelion sync tests. The observation booth was mainly asking the First some questions and ordering her to do this and that, and Asuka, being left out from all of it, felt like drifting off to sleep.  
她被连接到一个假体上。她不知道他们在测试什么指标，但身体的麻木感以及只能感觉到右臂的事实告诉她，这确实不同于常规的 EVA 同步测试。观察室主要是在向第一适格者提问并下达指令，而明日香被排除在外，感觉快要睡着了。

She really would have fallen asleep, if not for the creeping anxiety that started to grip her.  
如果不是那逐渐袭来的焦虑开始攫住她的心，她真的可能会睡着。

_Autopilot. 自动驾驶。_

_What does that even mean?  
那到底是什么意思？_

With Shinji out of her (physical) sight and the issue of sync rate suspended for the moment, the question of the nature of this test started to rise to the forefront of her thoughts.  
随着真嗣离开了她的（物理）视线，同步率问题暂时搁置，这次测试的本质开始浮现在她的思绪前沿。

Autopilot. Did that mean they were trying to automate the piloting?  
自动驾驶。这是否意味着他们试图实现驾驶的自动化？

In fact, many aspects of Evangelion piloting were already automated even now. HUD autofocus. Damage control. Threat assessment. Fire control systems. Real-time battlefield information sharing systems. Life support systems. Asuka had memorized all their specifics since childhood. But they were all designed to support the pilot, and she had never heard them referred to as _autopilot_ or anything like that.  
事实上，如今许多福音战士的驾驶方面已经实现了自动化。HUD 自动对焦、损伤控制、威胁评估、火力控制系统、实时战场信息共享系统、生命维持系统。明日香从小就记住了它们的所有细节。但它们都是为了支持驾驶员而设计的，她从未听说过它们被称为自动驾驶或类似的东西。

There must be a reason when they were using such a term for this supposed new technology.  
他们用这样一个术语来称呼这项所谓的新技术，必定有其原因。

_What are they up to? What are they hiding from us?  
他们到底在搞什么鬼？又在对我们隐瞒什么？_

An answer occurred to her, an answer so disgusting and unbelievable that she automatically turned from it and tried in vain to find an alternative. But as time passed, she began to realize that her intuition might have been right.  
一个答案浮现在她脑海中，这个答案如此恶心且难以置信，她本能地回避并试图寻找其他解释。但随着时间的推移，她开始意识到自己的直觉可能是正确的。

_Are they researching an AI that can replace pilots or something like that? Why now all of a sudden?  
他们是在研究一种能替代飞行员的 AI 之类的东西吗？为什么现在突然这么急？_

And then, at that moment, everything seemed to click in her head.  
然后，就在那一刻，一切似乎在她脑海中豁然开朗。

Asuka thought of all the little mistakes and close calls she'd had in battles so far. A not-insignificant proportion of them were her fault, although it was hard to admit.  
明日香回想起迄今为止在战斗中犯下的所有小错误和险些失手的情况。其中不少确实是她的责任，尽管承认这一点很难。

And on top of that, Asuka was a properly trained pilot. A real one. Unlike, say, the First, who Asuka had no idea what the hell she was doing or why she was even here, or Shinji, who was a last-minute fill-in they had to bring in. It was natural then, that before Asuka joined the fray, they had to rely on luck more than anything else. Their situation was supposed to improve once Asuka and her Unit-02 came, but her contributions since she arrived were disappointing, even to herself. She couldn't, then, imagine what the higher-ups were thinking about her performances.  
不仅如此，明日香还是一位经过正规训练的驾驶员，真正的飞行员。不像，比如说，第一适格者，明日香完全不知道她在做什么或者为什么在这里，或者是真嗣，那个他们不得不临时拉来的替补。因此，在明日香加入战斗之前，他们更多地是依赖运气。原本明日香和她的二号机到来后，情况应该会有所改善，但她自到达以来的表现令人失望，甚至让她自己都感到沮丧。她无法想象高层对她这些表现有何看法。

In light of all that, it wasn't surprising that they reached the conclusion that the human pilots couldn't be relied upon and should be replaced by machines.  
鉴于这一切，他们得出结论，人类驾驶员不可靠，应该被机器取代，这并不令人意外。

Asuka felt a chill run down her spine. What were those machines, then? Something repulsive, impersonating a human while not being an actual human. Just pretending. A doll.  
明日香感到脊背发凉。那些机器到底是什么？令人厌恶的东西，模仿人类却并非真正的人类，只是在假装，一个玩偶。

_They're trying to replace me with a...  
他们试图用一个……来取代我。_

A high-pitched scream pierced her ears. For a moment, Asuka couldn't even tell if she'd actually heard the scream or if she'd just imagined it. The question was answered when panicked voices broke out from the observational booth line. And she felt odd, something like a dull weight on her arm.  
一声尖锐的尖叫刺穿了她的耳朵。一时间，明日香甚至无法确定自己是否真的听到了那声尖叫，还是仅仅是她的想象。当观察室里传来慌乱的声音时，这个问题得到了解答。而且她感觉很奇怪，手臂上仿佛压着一种沉重的钝感。

It took her a moment to realize what it was. The dummy body was wriggling and moving on its own.  
她花了一会儿才意识到那是什么。那个假人偶正在自己蠕动和移动。

Asuka hastily tapped the controls to turn on the comms, then hesitated at the last second. The scream had clearly come from the First, but Asuka had no desire to speak to her. She pressed the button once, highlighting the next in the queue, Shinji's window.  
明日香急忙敲击控制台开启通讯，却在最后一刻犹豫了。那尖叫声显然来自绫波，但明日香并不想与她交谈。她按下按钮一次，选择了队列中的下一个，真嗣的窗口。

_Ask him what the hell he did this time, maybe.  
也许该问问他这次又干了什么。_

Maybe this would be a good excuse to talk to Shinji, she thought. But Asuka quickly pushed such vain thoughts aside. She wasn't one hundred percent sure, of course, but this probably wasn't Shinji's fault. And with the sensation in her arm getting weirder and stronger by the second, she didn't have any time to try something on Shinji either. Asuka opened a line to the observational booth.  
或许这是个和真嗣交谈的好借口，她想。但明日香很快将这些虚荣的想法抛诸脑后。当然，她并非百分百确定，但这大概不是真嗣的错。而且随着手臂上的感觉越来越怪异且强烈，她也没有时间去试探真嗣了。明日香打开了观测室的通讯线路。

"What the hell is this?! What the hell is going on?!"  
"这到底是什么鬼？！到底发生了什么？！"

The line crackled, then a female operator's voice followed, over the public line. Ibuki, probably. Asuka could almost remember that name now.  
线路中传来噼啪声，随后是女接线员的声音，通过公共线路。大概是伊吹吧。明日香现在几乎能记起那个名字了。

"We got an unexpected situation at the facility. We're going to eject your plugs just in case. Right above us is the Geofront lake, so when the movement stops, don't open the plug, just stay inside. We'll send someone. Got it?"  
"我们这里出现了意外情况。为了以防万一，我们将弹射你们的插入栓。你们上方是 Geofront 湖，所以当震动停止时，不要打开插入栓，待在里面。我们会派人过去的。明白了吗？"

_Oh, for Christ's sake. 哦，看在上帝的份上。_

As soon as Ibuki's words finished, Asuka tensed her legs and lower abdomen and breathed in as much as she could to increase the pressure in her chest cavity. Launching an Evangelion applied considerable Gs on the pilot's body, and, although she'd never done it herself, the emergency ejection had no reason to be any different. Asuka's pilot common sense was telling her that, enduring such a thing buck naked like this, without the aid of a plugsuit to help her blood circulation and chest pressure, would not be a pleasant experience at all.  
伊吹话音刚落，明日香便绷紧双腿和下腹，尽可能深吸一口气，以增加胸腔内的压力。启动 EVA 会给驾驶员的身体带来相当大的 G 力，尽管她自己从未亲身经历过，但紧急弹射应该也不会有什么不同。明日香的常识告诉她，像这样赤裸裸地承受这一切，没有插入服帮助血液循环和胸压，绝对不会是什么愉快的体验。

_Should I warn him? 我应该警告他吗？_

Asuka thought about it for a moment, but her mouth wouldn't open. Maybe she was, just like a moment ago, looking for an excuse to talk to Shinji.  
明日香思索片刻，但嘴巴却怎么也张不开。或许她就像刚才那样，正寻找着与真嗣搭话的借口。

_I'm sure the best pilot would do a good job without my help. I should mind my own business.  
我相信最优秀的驾驶员即使没有我的帮助也能做得很好。我应该管好自己的事。_

But, despite Asuka's preparation, nothing happened. Instead, Akagi's irritated voice blasted from the speakers.  
然而，尽管明日香做好了准备，什么也没有发生。取而代之的是，赤木律子从扬声器中传出的恼怒声音。

"Why are they not ejecting?!"  
"为什么他们不弹射出去？！"

There was a slight sense of physical distance and echo in the doctor's voice, indicating she walked away from the mic. A time long enough for a couple of blinks passed before a smaller voice was heard.  
医生的声音中带着一丝物理上的距离感和回声，表明她已经离开了麦克风。眨了几下眼的时间过去后，一个更小的声音被听到。

"The catapults are not working!"  
"弹射装置失灵了！"

"Ms. Ritsuko...! Ayanami's...!"  
"瑞穗小姐...！绫波她...！"

Shinji's window, labeled SOUND ONLY, flashed, but Asuka ignored his voice and didn't even glance in the window's direction.  
真嗣的窗口，标记着仅限通话，闪烁着，但明日香无视了他的声音，甚至没有朝窗口的方向瞥一眼。

With a rattle, Akagi's voice became closer. "What's the problem?"  
随着一阵响动，赤木的声音变得更近了。“出什么事了？”

"Voltage problem, ma'am. The output is simply not enough to eject all three plugs at once!"  
电压问题，女士。输出功率不足以同时弹出所有三个插头！

With a typing sound, a man's voice came from the distance, almost close to muttering. "It's either because they shaved 60 days off the deadline for this building. Or this line was fried during the last great outage and went unnoticed because it wasn't used frequently, only to be found out now..."  
随着一阵打字声，一个男人的声音从远处传来，近乎自言自语。“要么是因为他们把这座建筑的工期缩短了 60 天。要么就是上次大停电时这条线路被烧坏了，因为不常用所以没被注意到，直到现在才发现……”

Contrary to the man's almost leisurely voice, the other voices in the background were getting louder and more panicked. The strange sensations in Asuka's arm were very intense now, twitching quite frequently, and the plug she was sitting in had started to shake at some point too.  
与男人近乎悠闲的语调相反，背景中的其他声音变得越来越响亮和慌乱。此刻，明日香手臂上的奇怪感觉异常强烈，频繁地抽搐着，她所坐的插头不知何时也开始摇晃起来。

_What the hell is going on? Berserking? I heard the First had so many berserk incidents with her stupid unit that it almost killed her. Is that kind of thing happening now too?  
这到底是怎么回事？狂暴化？我听说第一部队因为她那愚蠢的单位发生了多次狂暴事件，差点要了她的命。现在这种事也在发生吗？_

"What if we disable the E-block's functions and divert this line's output to here, and here, and here?" Akagi asked, her voice almost nervous.  
“如果我们禁用 E 区的功能，并将这条线路的输出转移到这儿、这儿和这儿呢？”赤城问道，声音几乎有些紧张。

Typing sounds. "We still don't have enough to fire off all three of them at once, but we can eject them one at a time, 15 seconds apart!"  
键盘敲击声。“我们仍然没有足够的能量同时发射所有三个，但我们可以每隔 15 秒依次弹射它们！”

"Then do it!" “那就去做！”

It took a moment for Asuka to realize what Akagi meant. Asuka exhaled all the LCL she'd breathed in and pressed the speak button on her console. White bubbles formed around her mouth.  
过了一会儿，明日香才明白美里指的是什么。她将吸入的 LCL 全部呼出，按下了控制台上的通话按钮。她的嘴边形成了白色的泡沫。

"Let Shinji," go first and send me off last, Asuka tried to say. All the resentment and anger that had been building up didn't matter in the slightest at this moment. All that mattered was that something was wrong here, and they couldn't escape all at once. Asuka had no intention of putting herself before Shinji in such a situation. It was a reflexive decision, not a calculated action. The realization of it warmed her heart. Yes, she would rather die than risk Shinji. She would have said so, if not for Akagi's words that followed.  
“让真嗣先走，我最后再走。”明日香试图说出口。积压已久的怨恨和愤怒在这一刻都变得无关紧要。重要的是这里出了问题，他们不能同时逃脱。明日香在这种情况下绝不会让自己先于真嗣。这是一个本能的决定，而非经过深思熟虑的行动。意识到这一点，她的心感到了温暖。是的，她宁愿死也不愿让真嗣冒险。如果不是美里接下来的话，她本会这么说的。

"Shinji's plug first, then Rei, then Asuka. Now!"  
“先弹出真嗣的插入栓，然后是绫波，再是明日香。现在！”

Asuka's plug began to shake, and she heard a loud crack. Shinji's comm window disappeared. Then the First's followed. Asuka puffed out her chest, bracing for impact.  
明日香的插入栓开始摇晃，她听到一声巨响。真嗣的通讯窗口消失了。接着是绫波的。明日香挺起胸膛，准备迎接冲击。

---

Five minutes had passed after the emergency ejection. Or fifty minutes. Or three hours. Asuka had lost track of time.  
紧急弹射后已经过去了五分钟。或者是五十分钟。或者是三个小时。明日香已经失去了时间感。

Under the dim light of the preservation mode, the only company she had was the white noise of the quietly running HVAC and the sound of her own heartbeat.  
在保存模式的昏暗灯光下，她唯一的伴侣是静静运行的 HVAC 发出的白噪音，以及自己心跳的声音。

Ah, and of course, the downwardly spiraling, toxic vortex of venomous thoughts was here too, but could she really call it company?  
啊，当然，还有那不断下坠、充满毒性的思想漩涡，但她真的能称之为伴侣吗？

Asuka couldn't shake them off. She didn't try very hard, either. Because her intuition was telling her, in a cold voice, that they were right.  
明日香无法摆脱它们。她也没有太努力去尝试。因为她的直觉正用冰冷的声音告诉她，它们是对的。

It was pointless to deny it. It was all Shinji's fault.  
否认这一点毫无意义。这一切都是真嗣的错。

_But you literally wanted it. What are you complaining about? Blaming him again?  
但你确实想要它。你在抱怨什么？又怪他吗？_

Asuka shook her head, brushing away the voice like it was a particularly bothersome fly. This time, it wasn't the usual case of irrational emotions overpowering rationality. This time, it was one of those rare occasions where the angry, emotional Asuka was also entirely right, and the timid, pacifist Asuka who was trying to calm herself down was on the defensive.  
明日香摇了摇头，像赶走一只特别烦人的苍蝇一样甩开那个声音。这一次，并非往常那种非理性的情绪压倒理性。这一次，是那种难得的时刻，愤怒而情绪化的明日香完全正确，而试图让自己冷静下来的胆怯、和平主义的明日香则处于守势。

_That's different. You taking the risk on your own is different from the higher-ups putting you in harm's way. The result might be the same, but the reasons are different. The former is a sacrifice you're making for someone you love. The latter is simply Akagi deciding that your value is lower than Shinji's, lower than even the First's. It means they see you as expendable, the first to be sacrificed in an emergency.  
这不一样。你独自承担风险与高层将你置于险境是两回事。结果或许相同，但原因不同。前者是你为所爱之人做出的牺牲。后者则是赤木决定你的价值低于真嗣，甚至低于第一位的。这意味着他们视你为可牺牲的，紧急情况下首先被牺牲的对象。_

Asuka really, desperately wanted to find something, some sort of logic to argue against that, but she couldn't and it was driving her crazy.  
明日香真的、极度渴望找到某种逻辑来反驳这一点，但她找不到，这让她快要疯了。

_It's all his fault that I'm being treated this way. It's his fault I've fallen to this point.  
我被这样对待都是他的错。我落到这个地步也是他的错。_

And it was true. Asuka could think of no reason to prioritize her over Shinji from Akagi's perspective. Poor combat performance. Lower sync rate. Why would she choose to preserve Asuka when they had the ace pilot with so many proven kill counts?  
事实确实如此。从赤木的角度来看，明日香想不出任何理由要优先于真嗣。战斗表现不佳。同步率较低。既然他们已经有了这位战绩累累的王牌驾驶员，为何还要选择保留明日香呢？

And in that moment, the thought that was interrupted by the First's scream earlier flashed through her mind again.  
就在那一刻，之前被初号机尖叫声打断的念头再次闪过她的脑海。

_And not just Shinji. They're trying to replace me with a doll.  
不仅仅是真嗣。他们试图用一个玩偶来取代我。_

Asuka felt her heart freeze. She wanted to simultaneously scream and curl up in a ball. Things she didn't want to think about kept coming to mind, so she forced herself to turn her attention elsewhere. To things that were relatively manageable and easier to deflect her anger towards.  
明日香感到心脏仿佛凝固。她既想尖叫又想蜷缩成一团。那些她不愿思考的事情不断涌入脑海，于是她强迫自己转移注意力，转向那些相对容易处理、更能让她发泄愤怒的事物。

_This is his fault, too. If not for him, I would never be in this situation.  
这也是他的错。如果不是因为他，我绝不会陷入这种境地。_

_That was a bit much_, a cautious voice timidly spoke up in the back of her mind. It's not like Shinji had punched down her sync rate or something, and anyway, the research on autopilot couldn't have started just after Asuka's sync rate started to go haywire. That was too recent to be the case. It had probably been in development for a long time, maybe years even, and was only now ready to be tested at the pilot level. Blaming Shinji for that was too much. Maybe she was treating him unfairly.  
这有点过分了，一个谨慎的声音在她脑海中怯生生地响起。并不是说真嗣降低了她的同步率，而且无论如何，自动驾驶的研究不可能在她的同步率开始失控后才开始。那太近了，不可能是这样。这项研究可能已经进行了很长时间，甚至可能是几年，只是现在才准备好进行飞行员级别的测试。把这归咎于真嗣太过分了。也许她对他不公平。

_Then how am I supposed to treat him?  
那我该怎么对待他呢？_

Asuka's gaze shifted to the image projected on the LCL, left of the seat. Almost immediately after the plug stopped moving and she recovered from the near-blackout situation, a comm request came from Shinji's plug, and Asuka had been ignoring it until now.  
明日香的目光转向了 LCL 中左侧座位上的投影图像。几乎在插入栓停止移动且她从近乎昏迷的状态中恢复过来后，来自真嗣插入栓的通讯请求就传来了，而明日香一直无视到现在。

_How indeed. 确实如此。_

Asuka stared at the slowly flashing window like a hypnotized person.  
明日香盯着那缓慢闪烁的窗口，仿佛被催眠了一般。

Shinji was trying to talk to her, the first time he'd tried to in days. Asuka realized that not long ago, she would have wholeheartedly welcomed it. Only because, ironically, she wasn't feeling the same now.  
真嗣正试图和她说话，这是几天来他第一次尝试。明日香意识到，不久前，她还会全心全意地欢迎这种交流。只是讽刺的是，现在她已经没有了同样的感觉。

_Why?_ When she asked herself that, the answer came immediately, as if she had known it all along.  
为什么？当她问自己这个问题时，答案立刻浮现，仿佛她一直都知道。

Because she was afraid of the reason. Why would he talk to her now all of a sudden?  
因为她害怕那个原因。为什么他会突然开始和她说话？

_And why am I afraid?_ She didn't want to think about it. Asuka was so angry at herself for even feeling that way. It made her impulsively reach out for the control yoke.  
而我为何会害怕？她不愿去想。明日香对自己有这种感觉感到非常愤怒。这让她冲动地伸手去抓操纵杆。

The next moment found Asuka horrified for several reasons.  
下一刻，明日香因多种原因感到惊恐。

First, her idiot of a boyfriend had called her on regular communication, not sound only, which meant they were, essentially, video-calling.  
首先，她那笨蛋男友居然用常规通讯联系她，而不是仅限语音，这意味着他们实际上是在视频通话。

Asuka couldn't even get angry because she knew he did it out of incompetence, not malice. He was still not good at all the little miscellaneous features of Evangelion piloting. _So pathetic,_ she thought, crossing her legs and covering her chest with one arm in panic.  
明日香甚至无法生气，因为她知道他这么做是因为无能，而非恶意。他对《福音战士》驾驶中的那些琐碎功能仍然一窍不通。真是可悲，她心想，交叉双腿并用一只手臂慌乱地遮住胸部。

And then Asuka blinked in surprise. Because…  
然后明日香惊讶地眨了眨眼。因为……

Shinji's plug in the comm window was empty. Completely void of any human presence. The boy who was supposed to be sitting on the seat was nowhere to be seen.  
真嗣的插入栓在通讯窗口内空无一人。完全没有任何人类的踪迹。本应坐在座位上的男孩不知所踪。

_What the hell. 搞什么鬼。_

Asuka leaned over to the comm window. It didn't make the screen zoom in or the camera spin, it was more of a reflexive reaction to something she couldn't understand. There was nothing but the empty control suite in the dim orange screen.  
明日香俯身靠近通讯窗口。这并非屏幕放大或摄像头旋转的操作，更像是对某种无法理解的情况的本能反应。昏暗的橙色屏幕中，只有空荡荡的控制舱。

Asuka sat stunned, completely dumbfounded.  
明日香坐在那里，完全惊呆了。

And then the last thing struck her, in the form of a sudden, loud thumping noise overhead. Asuka almost peed herself.  
然后最后一件事以一种突然的、响亮的敲击声形式击中了她。明日香差点吓尿了。

She looked up, her eardrums feeling like they were about to rip out, her heart pounding hard. Just as she wondered whether or not she'd really heard something, she heard another thud. Someone or something was pounding on the entry plug from outside.  
她抬头望去，耳膜感觉快要撕裂，心跳剧烈。就在她怀疑自己是否真的听到了什么时，又一声闷响传来。有人或有什么东西正在从外部敲打着插入栓。

_Did they send the retrieval team this fast? Is that why Shinji's seat was empty? Did they pick him up already and it's my turn?  
他们这么快就派出回收小组了吗？所以真嗣的座位是空的？他们已经接走他了，现在轮到我了？_

Then she heard an unexpected voice.  
然后她听到了一个意想不到的声音。

"Asuka! Asuka?! Are you in there?"  
“明日香！明日香？！你在里面吗？”

Asuka blinked. "Shinji?" 明日香眨了眨眼。“真嗣？”

Before she knew it, Asuka had swum to the side hatch. She was already turning the handle. Her hands stopped as she realized what she was doing. It was as if something stickier than the LCL was resisting against her fingers.  
在她意识到之前，明日香已经游到了侧面的舱门。她已经开始转动把手。当她意识到自己在做什么时，手停了下来。仿佛有什么比 LCL 更粘稠的东西在抗拒着她的手指。

_Stop being silly. 别犯傻了。_

Muttering words that could be interpreted either way, Asuka turned the handle. A few turns later the hatch opened.  
嘟囔着模棱两可的话，明日香转动把手。几圈之后，舱门打开了。

Almost right after the dark 'sky' filled her vision, Asuka's lungs started to act up, as they always did after smelling fresh air. She gripped the edge of the doorway with both hands and leaned out, vomiting the LCL that had been deep in her lungs. It was not her first rodeo, but that didn't mean she got used to the tearing sensation in her throat and the unpleasant weight in her chest.  
几乎就在黑暗的‘天空’填满她的视野之后，明日香的肺部开始发作，每次呼吸到新鲜空气后总是如此。她双手紧抓着门口边缘，探出身子，将深藏肺中的 LCL 呕吐出来。这已经不是她第一次经历，但并不意味着她能习惯喉咙撕裂的感觉和胸中的不适感。

Two small feet appeared in front of her eyes with the light, echoey sound of bare skin kicking metal. Water dripped and pooled around them. The owner of the feet hesitated for a moment, then squatted down in front of Asuka. The soles made a squeaky sound as they slid uneasily on the sloped surface of the entry plug. Asuka cursed herself for being utterly distracted by the way his thing swung with the motion of sitting down.  
随着光亮和回响的赤脚踢金属声，两双小脚出现在她眼前。水滴汇聚在他们周围。脚的主人犹豫了一下，然后蹲在明日香面前。脚掌在插入栓的斜面上不安地滑动，发出吱吱声。明日香暗骂自己完全被他坐下时那东西的摆动分了心。

Irritated, Asuka roughly pushed away Shinji's hand, which was trying to pat her back.  
恼怒之下，明日香粗暴地推开了试图轻拍她背部的真嗣的手。

"Don't," she said, and then coughed shortly. "That's what everyone does instinctively, but it doesn't really help. The liquid -"  
“别这样，”她说着，随即短促地咳了一声。“这是每个人本能的反应，但实际上没什么用。那些液体——”

Another cough, this time longer and more violent. Asuka wiped the LCL that spurted out of her nostrils with the back of her hand. "The liquid that was coming up could go down again by the impact. Didn't they train you for this?"  
又是一阵咳嗽，这次更长也更剧烈。明日香用手背擦去从鼻孔喷出的 LCL。“那些涌上来的液体可以通过冲击力再咽回去。他们没训练过你这个吗？”

Shinji didn't respond aside from a grunt.  
真嗣除了哼了一声外没有回应。

She still felt sticky LCL all over her insides, but she still pulled herself up and out of the plug, judging that her lungs were emptied enough. Shinji scrambled to his feet and held out a hand. Asuka ignored it. The sticky LCL pooled around her feet and made her unsteady for a moment, but Asuka was nimble and athletic unlike, say, Shinji, so she regained her balance soon enough.  
她仍感觉体内黏糊糊的 LCL，但还是挣扎着从插入栓里爬了出来，判断自己的肺已经排空得差不多了。真嗣慌忙站起身，伸出手来。明日香无视了它。黏稠的 LCL 在她脚下积聚，让她一时站立不稳，但明日香敏捷且运动能力强，不像真嗣那样，所以她很快恢复了平衡。

The entry plug swung in the gentle waves under their feet. Asuka looked around to find two plugs, half submerged in the dark water, just like Asuka's. One had its hatch wide open. The exterior lights from the HQ pyramid spilled over here, as if as a pseudo-moonlight, reflecting blue on the water's surface.  
插入栓在他们脚下轻轻摇晃。明日香环顾四周，发现两个插入栓半浸在黑暗的水中，就像明日香的那个一样。其中一个的舱盖大开着。总部金字塔的外部灯光洒落在这里，仿佛是伪月光，水面反射出蓝色的光芒。

Asuka clicked her tongue once and looked back at Shinji. Shinji, as naked as Asuka, blushed brightly, visible even in the dim, distant lights that reached them through the night, and covered his groin with both hands. He turned his face half way, as if he wanted to look away from her, but his eyes flickered back and forth between her breasts and her face.  
明日香咂了一下舌，回头看向真嗣。真嗣和明日香一样赤裸着身体，即使在夜晚微弱的光线下，他的脸也红得明显，双手捂住下体。他转过头去，似乎想避开她，但他的目光却在她的胸部和脸之间来回游移。

Her body quickly chilled, standing dripping wet and naked against the night breeze off the lake. It was nothing like what happened at a swimming pool or beach; unlike the cold water of those places, the LCL in the entry plug was kept fairly warm to minimize body heat loss. So when Asuka wrapped her arms around herself, shivering, it was from the cold, not because of Shinji's lusty gaze.  
她站在湖边，浑身湿透，赤裸着面对夜风，身体很快感到寒冷。这与游泳池或海滩上的感觉截然不同；那些地方的水通常较冷，而插入栓内的 LCL 则保持相当温暖以减少体温流失。因此，当明日香抱紧自己，颤抖时，是因为寒冷，而不是因为真嗣那充满欲望的目光。

Or maybe it contributed a bit, too. Otherwise, she had no way to explain why she was intently focusing on his eyes. As those eyes widened, Asuka felt a surge of pleasure. She slowly, and theatrically pulled her arms up and stooped her shoulders, as if wincing. It grabbed his attention like a charm. He stopped his sad attempts to look at her eyes, now blatantly staring in one place.  
或许也有一点关系吧。否则，她无法解释自己为何如此专注地盯着他的眼睛。当那双眼睛睁大时，明日香感到一阵快感。她缓缓地、戏剧性地抬起双臂，耸起肩膀，仿佛在畏缩。这一举动立刻吸引了他的注意。他停止了试图看她眼睛的可怜尝试，现在明显地盯着一个地方。

_Of course you do,_ Asuka smiled faintly and shrugged once for a better view. Asuka wasn't oversized like a certain captain - no, major now, who looked slutty and unfashionable, so sweaty and smelly by the end of the afternoon. But she wasn't that small either when she bunched them up like this. She had used this little trick back at the swimming pool, too.  
当然，明日香微微一笑，耸了耸肩以便更好地展示。明日香不像某位队长——不，现在是少校了，看起来既放荡又不时髦，到了下午末尾时还一身汗臭。但她这样聚拢起来也不算小。她在游泳池也用过这个小技巧。

But the satisfaction was short-lived. The situation was forcing them to have a talk, a serious talk, and Asuka didn't know what to say to him at this point. Her mind started to return to her thoughts back at the plug.  
但满足感转瞬即逝。局势迫使他们必须进行一次谈话，一次严肃的谈话，而明日香此时不知该如何对他说。她的思绪开始回到插入栓里的那些想法。

_To me, he's a- 对我来说，他是个——_

Afraid of the words her mind was conjuring up, Asuka quickly opened her mouth before it was too late. Anything. Just to bury the silence. "You swam all the way here?"  
害怕脑海中浮现的那些话语，明日香迅速张开嘴，以免为时已晚。任何话都行。只为打破这沉默。“你是游过来的吗？”

Shinji flinched like he was released from a trance. His mouth opened and closed once. Asuka felt a tinge of self-hatred at how uncharacteristically stupid she sounded.  
真嗣像是被从恍惚中唤醒般一颤。他的嘴巴张开又合上一次。明日香感到一丝自我厌恶，她听起来是多么不合时宜的愚蠢。

_Of course he did. Or what, you think he flew?_ A small voice mocked her from inside. Asuka shook her head.  
他当然是游过来的。不然呢，你以为他是飞过来的？内心一个小小的声音嘲讽着她。明日香摇了摇头。

"Why are you here?" “你为什么在这里？”

It was a very obvious and natural question, but after spitting it out, Asuka realized she might have made a mistake. She was making mistake after mistake. So unlike her.  
这是一个非常明显且自然的问题，但话一出口，明日香意识到自己可能犯了个错误。她一错再错，这完全不像她。

Asuka gritted her teeth and glared at Shinji. Shinji, who had no idea why Asuka was upset, visibly shrank.  
明日香咬紧牙关，瞪着真嗣。真嗣完全不明白明日香为何生气，明显地退缩了。

It might have been better if she just ignored him and not come out. This was a very delicate situation she walked into.  
如果她当时不理他，不出去就好了。她走进了一个非常微妙的局面。

If Shinji said something like 'because I was worried about you,' it would be fine. Asuka would call him an idiot, vent her frustrations of the past few days, and then sweep everything under the rug, as if nothing had been wrong at all. Maybe she could even kiss him by the time they got home.  
如果真嗣说出类似‘因为我担心你’的话，那就好了。明日香会骂他笨蛋，发泄这几天的怨气，然后像什么事都没发生过一样把一切都掩盖过去。或许到家时她还能亲他一下。

But the moment Shinji blurted out something else, Asuka would have to face it too. And there were so many possible candidates for that 'something else' position, none of which she wanted to face right now. Or ever.  
但一旦真嗣脱口而出其他的话，明日香也不得不面对。而那个‘其他的话’有太多可能，每一种她现在都不想面对，甚至永远都不想。

Shinji looked away with his trademark blank stare. Asuka continued glaring without speaking. Only after an uncomfortable amount of time passed did Shinji turn his attention back to her. He swallowed. The sound of it echoed loudly all over the quiet lake.  
真嗣移开视线，露出他标志性的茫然表情。明日香继续瞪着他，一言不发。直到一段令人不适的时间过去，真嗣才重新将注意力转回她身上。他咽了咽口水，那声音在寂静的湖面上回响得格外响亮。

"Asuka. Ms. Ritsuko is-" "明日香。赤木博士她——"

Asuka hissed. Shinji closed his mouth. It was so hard for her to speak when her stomach churned like a stormy sea. "...Shut up. Just shut your mouth."  
明日香低声咆哮。真嗣闭上了嘴。对她来说，当胃里翻江倒海如同暴风雨般时，说话是如此艰难。"...闭嘴。别再说了。"

Shinji bit his lip and lowered his head. For a moment he remained still like that, but this time he wasn't looking at Asuka's breasts or stomach or groin. A ripple gently rocked the plug. With that, Shinji looked up, a slightly more determined look on his face this time, and approached her. He reached out to her with one hand. Asuka instinctively stepped back.  
真嗣咬了咬嘴唇，低下头。有那么一会儿，他就这样静静地站着，但这次他没有盯着明日香的胸部、腹部或胯部。插头轻轻摇晃了一下。随即，真嗣抬起头，脸上带着比之前更加坚定的表情，向她走近。他伸出一只手，明日香本能地后退了一步。

The plug didn't float flatly. The part where the heavier machinery like the main motor and such were placed was submerged slightly deeper, making the floating part a bit sloped. And Asuka was backtracking uphill, while Shinji chased her. A dizzying jumble of wet footsteps echoed, ending with Shinji stopping first. Asuka stretched out a hand and held up an index finger. "Don't."  
插头并没有平稳地浮在水面上。那些较重的机械部分，如主电机等，沉得更深一些，使得浮动部分略显倾斜。而明日香正逆坡而上，真嗣紧随其后。一串湿漉漉的脚步声杂乱无章地回响着，最终以真嗣率先停下告终。明日香伸出手，竖起食指。“别过来。”

Growing hesitation permeated Shinji's body language. His gaze shifted to Asuka's feet. Asuka's eyes followed it reflexively. That was when she realized she had almost reached the end of the plug and was only a few steps away from the tip.  
真嗣的动作中透出越来越多的犹豫。他的目光转向明日香的脚。明日香的眼光不由自主地随之移动。就在那时，她意识到自己几乎已经走到了插头的尽头，离尖端仅几步之遥。

_Why is he checking it? The distance?  
他为什么要检查这个？距离吗？_

No sooner did she think of such a question than Shinji moved again. Asuka's heart began to beat frantically. Because there was that look on his face, the look she'd seen several times before.  
她刚想到这个问题，真嗣就再次动了起来。明日香的心开始狂跳不已。因为他脸上出现了那种表情，那种她之前见过几次的表情。

She thought she should back off, but the soles of her feet were glued to the plug and wouldn't budge. It was a bizarre sensation, as if her legs were frozen hard but at the same time felt like jelly.  
她觉得自己应该退后，但脚底却像粘在了插入栓上，一动不动。这是一种奇怪的感觉，仿佛她的双腿被冻得僵硬，同时又软得像果冻。

_Just let him do what he wants._ A small voice in her mind whispered. _You're tired of all this, honestly. Just pretend to lose. Maybe put up some kind of token resistance if your pride demands it. Whenever you did that after seeing that face on him, he made you happy. Let him hug you like you always let him. Kiss him, as if you're forced and have no other option. Hell, let him take you, right here and now. It'd be hard to lie down here but there would be ways to do it while standing._  
就让他做他想做的事吧。她脑海中有个小小的声音低语道。你已经厌倦这一切了，真的。假装输掉吧。如果自尊心要求的话，或许可以象征性地抵抗一下。每次看到他那副表情后，你这样做都会让他开心。让他像往常一样拥抱你。亲吻他，仿佛是被迫的，别无选择。甚至，就在这里，让他占有你。躺下可能会有些困难，但站着也有办法做到。

Her breath was shaky as it escaped through her lips. The thought that it might not be a bad idea to listen to her inner voice was so sincere and overwhelming that she was unable to move from her spot until Shinji closed in at arm's length and reached out to her. Now that hand would snatch her up and she would melt in his arms helplessly.  
她的呼吸颤抖着从唇间逸出。听从内心声音的想法如此真挚且势不可挡，以至于她无法从原地挪动，直到真嗣靠近到伸手可及的距离并向她伸出手。此刻那只手即将将她紧紧拥入怀中，她将无力地在他臂弯中融化。

But at the last moment, just before Shinji's harder-than-it-looked hand gripped her shoulder, Asuka finally remembered how she felt when she was sitting on the plug, alone. With a skilled and familiar procedure, she re-lived the moment of humiliation and anger so vividly. Using the emotions those memories evoked as fuel, Asuka's feet finally moved.  
但在最后一刻，就在真嗣看似强硬的手即将抓住她的肩膀之前，明日香终于记起了独自坐在插入栓中的感受。她熟练而熟悉地重温了那一刻的屈辱与愤怒，如此生动。利用这些记忆激发的情绪作为动力，明日香的脚终于动了。

Shinji's hand, almost on the verge of grabbing Asuka, swept through the empty air. As she expected there was a lot of force in the move, which acted against him now, tilting his body off balance. His feet slipped on the damp and sloped metal surface, making a screeching sound.  
真嗣的手，几乎就要抓住明日香，却扫过了空荡荡的空气。正如她所料，这一动作蕴含着巨大的力量，现在却反作用于他，使他的身体失去平衡。他的脚在潮湿且倾斜的金属表面上打滑，发出刺耳的声音。

Before Asuka realized what was happening, Shinji fell forward with a yelp. An ominously loud thud broke out as his head hit the metal, followed by the sound of his limp, naked body sliding down the curved slope of the plug and into the lake. There wasn't even a proper splash, as he entered the water feet first without flailing his arms or anything. Only a rather cute 'pong' sound rang out and that was it. Under any other circumstances, Asuka would have chuckled.  
在明日香意识到发生了什么之前，真嗣惊叫一声向前倒去。他的头撞在金属上，发出一声不祥的巨响，随后是他赤裸无力的身体顺着插入栓的弧形斜坡滑入湖中的声音。他双脚先入水，没有挥动手臂或任何动作，连个像样的水花都没有溅起，只发出了一声颇为可爱的‘扑通’声，就这样了。在其他任何情况下，明日香都会忍不住笑出声来。

What gripped her now instead was shock, and another strange feeling she couldn't quite explain.  
此刻紧紧抓住她的却是震惊，以及一种她无法完全解释的奇怪感觉。

_If he's gone, I'll- 如果他走了，我会——_

A moment later Asuka inhaled sharply and shuddered as if waking up from a nightmare. A belated scream echoed across the lake.  
片刻后，明日香深吸一口气，猛地颤抖起来，仿佛从噩梦中惊醒。一声迟来的尖叫在湖面上回荡。

"Shinji!" "真嗣！"

---

It was a pure miracle that Asuka found Shinji in the pitch-black water and dragged him to shore.  
明日香在漆黑的水中找到真嗣并将他拖上岸，这简直是个奇迹。

Asuka had no way of explaining what or how she had accomplished such a feat. Because her memory was largely blank in the middle. She remembered jumping into the water, but the next thing she knew, she was kneeling next to Shinji's limp body, pushing his chest down hard.  
明日香无法解释自己究竟是如何完成这一壮举的，因为她的记忆在那段时间里大部分是空白的。她只记得自己跳入了水中，但下一刻，她就已经跪在真嗣瘫软的身体旁，用力按压他的胸膛。

Even in the midst of all the madness, Asuka could precisely recall the points they had drilled into her bones. Halfway between the nipples. Arms straight all the way from the shoulder to the hands, never bent at the elbows. Pushing with all of your weight. Two compressions per second. 30 compressions followed by 2 breaths. Lift the chin and tilt the head, clear the airway. Visually checking the chest to see if it rises.  
即使在这一切疯狂之中，明日香仍能精确回忆起那些刻入骨髓的要点。乳头之间的一半位置。从肩膀到手，双臂始终保持笔直，肘部绝不弯曲。全身重量压上。每秒两次按压。30 次按压后接 2 次呼吸。抬起下巴，头部倾斜，清理气道。目视检查胸部是否起伏。

But even after executing the procedure five cycles by the book, Shinji still showed no signs of waking up, and she began to feel the strength seeping out from her arms.  
但即便严格按照流程进行了五个循环，真嗣依旧没有苏醒的迹象，她开始感到手臂的力量在逐渐流失。

Once again, Asuka recalled her training. Never stop the chest compressions until help arrives. If you feel you've reached the limit of your stamina, don't hesitate to pick a specific person around you to take over.  
明日香再次回想起她的训练。除非救援到来，否则绝不停下胸外按压。如果感到体力已达极限，毫不犹豫地选择周围某个人接替你。

But here, there was no help on the way, and no one to replace her. She was all alone. HQ wouldn't know anything, and it wasn't like she had any way of contacting them. And speaking of someone that might do CPR with her…  
但在这里，没有任何援助即将到来，也没有人能替代她。她孤身一人。总部不会知道任何事情，而且她也没有任何方式与他们联系。说到可能与她一起进行心肺复苏的人……

_Is that First bitch deaf or something? Didn't she hear me screaming and everything?  
那个首席婊子是聋了还是怎么的？难道她没听到我尖叫和所有声音吗？_

Twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty. Asuka stopped the compressions and leaned down. In an almost automated, unconscious motion, her index and middle fingers pushed up the tip of Shinji's chin, while her other hand pressed his forehead and held his nose with the index finger and thumb. She inhaled deeply, and closed his mouth with hers.  
二十七，二十八，二十九，三十。明日香停止了按压，俯下身去。几乎是一种自动的、无意识的动作，她的食指和中指推起了真嗣的下巴，而另一只手按住他的额头并用食指和拇指捏住他的鼻子。她深吸一口气，然后用嘴唇封住了他的嘴。

_No, you can't count on her. There's only one person you can trust and that's you.  
不，你不能指望她。唯一能信任的人只有你自己。_

Shinji's chest visibly rose as she exhaled deeply into his mouth, emptying her lungs. With a wet noise, Asuka removed her mouth from his and inhaled once more. At the same time, perhaps because she was focusing on the task at hand, all sorts of uncontrolled thoughts ran amok in her head unchecked.  
真嗣的胸膛明显地起伏，她深吸一口气，将肺中的空气全部吐入他的口中。随着一声湿润的声响，明日香从他嘴边移开，再次吸气。与此同时，或许是因为她专注于眼前的任务，各种失控的思绪在她脑海中肆意横行，未受约束。

_Yeah, you're alone, just like then. He's going to die in front of you, just like she did. You studied CPR and everything since you were a kid, thinking maybe there was something you could have done, but it wouldn't matter this time either. Just like your Evangelion training didn't matter.  
是啊，你孤身一人，就像那时一样。他会在你面前死去，就像她那样。你从小学习心肺复苏术，想着也许当时能做些什么，但这次也一样无济于事。就像你的 EVA 训练毫无用处一样。_

Asuka closed Shinji's mouth again. _Just shut up. Shut the fuck up._  
明日香再次合上了真嗣的嘴。闭嘴。他妈的闭嘴。

She emptied half of her lungs, but Shinji's chest didn't rise. She was losing concentration. Asuka tried to calm herself, breathing in through her nose, and moved her lips slightly over Shinji's mouth to seal it properly. She breathed out. This time it worked.  
她吐出了半口气，但真嗣的胸膛并未起伏。她的注意力正在涣散。明日香试图让自己冷静下来，用鼻子吸气，然后将嘴唇轻轻贴在真嗣的嘴上以确保密封。她呼出气。这次奏效了。

She didn't even have a single second to waste, so she scrambled to her knees and resumed the compressions. But there was noticeably less force in her hands than before. Her back, her arms, and her shoulders felt like they were on fire. A sound that was in the middle of a moan and a sob escaped her mouth, her frustration, sadness, and anger all mixed in.  
她连一秒钟都浪费不起，于是迅速跪起，继续做心肺复苏。但这次手上的力度明显减弱了。她的背部、手臂和肩膀仿佛在燃烧。一声介于呻吟和啜泣之间的声音从她口中逸出，混合着她的沮丧、悲伤和愤怒。

_I should have exercised more. I slacked off on training since I moved to Japan. I've become fat, soft, useless.  
我本该多锻炼的。自从搬到日本后，我就懈怠了训练。我现在变得肥胖、软弱、无用。_

Eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen.  
十一，十二，十三，十四。

_No, it's not my fault. It's Mr. Kaji's fault for forcing me to do that useless farmwork and draining stamina I could've used later. It's Misato's fault too, for putting me into such a stupid situation.  
不，这不是我的错。都是加治先生的错，他逼我做那些无用的农活，消耗了我本可以留到以后用的体力。这也是美里小姐的错，她把我置于如此愚蠢的境地。_

Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen. The up-and-down motion was getting slower and weaker while Asuka desperately searched for the person responsible for this mess. The first ideas that came to mind (Mr. Kaji, Misato) were frankly unconvincing even to herself, so she needed to find someone else.  
十五、十六、十七。上下起伏的动作越来越慢，越来越无力，而明日香拼命寻找着造成这一切混乱的罪魁祸首。最初浮现的念头（加持先生、美里）连她自己都觉得牵强，因此她需要找到其他人。

_Akagi. Yeah, why didn't I think of that bitch. This is all her fault.  
赤木律子。对啊，我怎么没想到那个婊子。这一切都是她的错。_

Eighteen, nineteen. Fueled by newfound rage and hatred, Asuka picked up the pace. A boiling roar escaped her throat.  
十八、十九。在新生的愤怒和憎恨驱使下，明日香加快了速度。喉咙里爆发出沸腾的咆哮。

_If anything happens to Shinji, I'm going to kill her. I'm going to kill her in any way I can. Won't be too hard. Sync test or something. I'll swat her like a fly with Unit-02 and that would be it.  
如果真嗣出了什么事，我一定会杀了她。我会用尽一切手段杀了她。不会太难的。同步测试之类的。我会像拍苍蝇一样用二号机把她解决掉，就这样。_

Twenty. Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four. In the middle of the compression, Asuka looked down at Shinji's face, breathing raggedly. She looked for anything; a twitch of the eyebrows, a twist of the lips, any sign of life, but there was no movement in that pale face. His eyes were closed, his mouth hung slack and open. Asuka felt like crying, tears clouding her world.  
二十。二十一，二十二，二十三，二十四。在压缩过程中，明日香低头看着真嗣的脸，呼吸急促。她寻找着任何迹象；眉毛的颤动，嘴角的扭曲，任何生命的迹象，但那张苍白的脸上毫无动静。他的眼睛闭着，嘴巴松弛地张开。明日香感到想哭，泪水模糊了她的视线。

_Now that I think of it, that's not enough. I'm going to give her a horrible, horrible death. Slowly. Painfully. I'm going to tear her limbs out one by one. I'll keep her alive for at least as long as I need to do it. I'll make her scream and piss herself and beg for me to kill her, and when she does I'll play with her some more. By the end they won't have anything to put in her coffin.  
现在想来，那还不够。我要让她经历一场可怕至极的死亡。慢慢地。痛苦地。我要一个接一个地撕下她的四肢。我会让她至少活到我完成这一切所需的时间。我会让她尖叫、失禁，乞求我杀了她，而当她这么做时，我会再玩弄她一会儿。到最后，他们连放进棺材的东西都不会有。_

Twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight. Her whole body was hot and sweaty. Asuka squeezed the last of her strength.  
二十五、二十六、二十七、二十八。她全身热汗淋漓。明日香挤出了最后一丝力气。

_Oh, that's cool, Asuka. I guess she deserves it. But tell me, what are we supposed to do with you, Asuka? What's the verdict for you?  
哦，那挺酷的，明日香。我想她应得的。但告诉我，我们该怎么处置你，明日香？你的判决是什么？_

Asuka sucked in a sharp breath, having nothing with which to counter the mocking voice. Twenty-nine. Thirty.  
明日香猛吸一口气，却无言以对那嘲弄的声音。二十九。三十。

Her lungs were on fire. Her breath, coming out of her mouth and nostrils, was on fire too. Like a puppet that lost its strings, Asuka collapsed on Shinji's chest. Her head was screaming at her to get up at once and start breathing for him, but her body wouldn't listen.  
她的肺如同着火一般。她的呼吸，从口鼻中喷薄而出，也如同燃烧。像断了线的木偶，明日香瘫倒在真嗣的胸膛上。她的头脑尖叫着让她立刻起身，开始为他呼吸，但她的身体却不听使唤。

At first, Asuka thought it was her ragged breathing that she was hearing. By the time she realized what was happening to her, with her eyes burning and her nose running free, she was already sobbing uncontrollably.  
起初，明日香以为那是自己急促的呼吸声。当她意识到自己身上发生了什么时，双眼灼热，鼻涕横流，她已无法控制地抽泣起来。

_But I promised myself to never cry again.  
但我曾发誓再也不流泪。_

Asuka hated herself so much. She couldn't put her finger on why. For crying like a child. For doing this to Shinji. Her own mind for pitying herself even in this situation.  
明日香痛恨自己到了极点。她说不清为什么。为了像孩子一样哭泣。为了对真嗣做出这种事。即使在这种情况下的自己，也还在可怜自己。

_You're thinking about your pride in front of your boyfriend's dead body because you cried. Even now you're thinking of such things. You're not normal. You're insane. You're broken. That's why Shinji paid this kind of price. For loving a crazy bitch like you.  
你在男友的尸体前想着自己的自尊，只因为你哭了。即便现在你还在想这些。你不正常。你疯了。你破碎了。这就是为什么真嗣要付出这样的代价。为了爱一个像你这样的疯女人。_

Asuka forced her head up and looked into Shinji's face. Glassy eyes looked up at her. Those eyes and a mouth that was leaking water on one corner were peaceful, almost smiling. Forgiving her even in death. And that sight almost broke Asuka. Until…  
明日香强迫自己抬起头，凝视着真嗣的脸。那双无神的眼睛向上望着她。那双眼睛和一角漏水的嘴角显得平静，几乎在微笑。即使在死亡中也在宽恕她。而这一幕几乎让明日香崩溃。直到……

_Wait._

Asuka blinked a few times and wiped the tears from her eyes with the back of her hand. Something was off. He was surely…  
明日香眨了几次眼，用手背擦去眼角的泪水。有些不对劲。他肯定……

One corner of Shinji's mouth lifted slightly. The voice that came out of it was painfully hoarse.  
真嗣的嘴角微微上扬。从他口中发出的声音沙哑得令人心痛。

"Asuka..." “明日香……”

Asuka's mouth moved in autopilot.  
明日香的下巴机械地动了动。

"...You find this funny? Is this funny to you?"  
"...你觉得这很有趣吗？对你来说这很好笑吗？"

"...Because I always," Shinji frowned for a moment, clearing his throat. Phlegm boiled in his neck. "I always, imagined you, on top of me, hot, sweaty, sometimes crying. But not like this."  
"...因为，我总是，" 真嗣皱了皱眉，清了清喉咙。痰在他的喉咙里沸腾。"我总是，想象你，在我上面，热，汗流浃背，有时哭泣。但不是这样。"

"You imagined what?" "你想象了什么？"

Only then did she realize the situation fully, everything finally coming to hit her. Half sobbing, half shouting, Asuka rushed to Shinji. His cold, earthy mouth opened beneath hers. Shinji reciprocated on his own, gently pulling the back of her head with one hand and wrapping his cold, stiff tongue around hers. For a moment, they reveled in the feel and taste of their long-lost mate.  
直到那时，她才完全意识到情况的严重性，一切终于击中了她。一边抽泣，一边大喊，明日香冲向真嗣。他的冰冷、泥土味的嘴唇在她下面张开。真嗣自发地回应，一只手轻轻拉住她的后脑勺，冰冷僵硬的舌头环绕着她的。有那么一刻，他们沉浸在久违的伴侣的感觉和味道中。

That is, until Shinji's violent coughing fit left Asuka's face plastered in spit and snot.  
也就是说，直到真嗣剧烈的咳嗽让明日香的脸上沾满了口水和鼻涕。

Asuka backed off in horror. But before she could protest, Shinji rolled over onto one side and coughed so hard it sounded like he was about to vomit out his own lungs. It suddenly occurred to Asuka that maybe it wasn't the wisest thing to stick her tongue down the throat of a boy who had had a hard time breathing until a moment ago.  
明日香惊恐地退后。但还没等她抗议，真嗣就侧身一滚，咳得如此剧烈，听起来他好像要把自己的肺都咳出来。明日香突然意识到，也许把舌头伸进一个直到刚才还在艰难呼吸的男孩喉咙里并不是最明智的事情。

Wiping away tears, spit, and snot with the back of her hand, Asuka dragged her knees to Shinji's side. Dirt and grass caked around her knees but she didn't mind in the slightest. For a moment, she thought about patting him on the back. He was whimpering in pain. But then she remembered what she'd said earlier on the plug and withdrew her hand at the last second.  
用袖子抹去泪水、唾沫和鼻涕，明日香拖着膝盖挪到真嗣身边。她的膝盖上沾满了泥土和草屑，但她毫不在意。有那么一会儿，她想拍拍他的背。他正痛苦地呜咽着。但随即她记起了在插入栓里说过的话，于是在最后一刻缩回了手。

After spitting out some water and gasping for air, making a sound like a bellows, Shinji finally rolled over onto his back. His breathing was steadier than before, but his chest was still rising and falling noticeably. Asuka reflexively lay down next to him, resting her head on his shoulder and her hand on his chest. It was cold to the touch. She was full of anguish and stress until a moment ago, but the kiss and the gross end of it made it hard to wallow in such emotions.  
吐出一些水后，真嗣喘着粗气，声音像风箱一样，终于翻过身来仰面躺着。他的呼吸比之前平稳了些，但胸膛仍明显地起伏着。明日香本能地躺在他旁边，头枕在他的肩上，手放在他的胸口。触感冰凉。她之前满是痛苦和压力，但那个吻和随之而来的狼狈，让她难以沉溺于这些情绪之中。

Shinji flinched at Asuka's touch. Maybe because her body was too hot -it really was, to be fair, especially compared to his cold body-, or he was being shy again. In case it was the latter, Asuka prepared the line, 'it's to prevent hypothermia, idiot,' and even rehearsed it in her head for a few times in that brief moment, but she never had a chance to use it. Because Shinji just lay still, saying nothing.  
真嗣在明日香触碰他时缩了一下。也许是因为她的身体太热了——确实如此，公平地说，尤其是与他的冰冷身体相比——或者他又害羞了。如果是后者，明日香准备好了台词，‘这是为了防止体温过低，笨蛋’，甚至在那一刻反复在脑海中排练了几遍，但她从未有机会说出口。因为真嗣只是静静地躺着，一言不发。

Maybe they had reached the place in a relationship where they don't need an excuse to lie side by side naked. Or maybe Shinji was just too tired to say anything. Hoping it was the former, Asuka scooted closer to Shinji, rubbing her cheek against his bony shoulder.  
也许他们已经到了那种关系，不需要借口就可以赤裸裸地并肩躺着。或者也许真嗣只是太累了，什么也说不出来。希望是前者，明日香向真嗣靠得更近，用脸颊蹭着他瘦削的肩膀。

A cool breeze blew in, stirring the branches and tall grass and cooling Asuka's body. There was no moonlight or stars, but the bright blue spotlights bouncing off the HQ pyramid, the distant lights of the trains snaking up the cavern wall, and the flashing red air traffic lights, high above on the skyscrapers that had been retracted for the night created an eerie yet beautiful scene on the lake's surface.  
一阵凉风吹来，摇动着树枝和高高的草丛，冷却了明日香的身体。没有月光或星星，但总部金字塔上反射的明亮蓝色聚光灯，蜿蜒在洞穴壁上的火车远光灯，以及夜晚缩回的高楼上闪烁的红色空中交通灯，在湖面上创造了一个既诡异又美丽的景象。

_It's quite fine,_ _actually_. Asuka thought. And the moment she did, Shinji's shoulder tensed slightly. Because of that, Asuka wasn't surprised when he opened his mouth.  
实际上，这挺好的。明日香心想。就在她这么想的一瞬间，真嗣的肩膀微微绷紧了。因此，当真嗣张开嘴时，明日香并不感到意外。

"Asuka." “明日香。”

"Yeah?" “嗯？”

Asuka turned her head to see Shinji's face, but he didn't move, just stared off into space like he did before. A strange feeling of unease began to grip Asuka again. She couldn't quite tell him to just shut up and not ruin the mood, so she kept her mouth shut and waited. It made her stomach burn.  
明日香转头去看真嗣的脸，但他没有动，只是像之前那样凝视着虚空。一种莫名的不安感再次抓住了明日香。她无法直接让他闭嘴，别破坏气氛，所以她保持沉默，等待着。这让她感到胃里一阵灼热。

However, Shinji's words, coming after a long pause, were not what Asuka had expected.  
然而，真嗣在长时间的停顿后说出的话，并非明日香所预料的那样。

"I'm not sure if I'm even alive. I feel so dazed. So weak."  
"我不确定自己是否还活着。我感觉如此恍惚。如此虚弱。"

Asuka didn't know what to say to that, or if he was even expecting an answer, so she just leaned against Shinji's shoulder and waited for him to continue. Shinji cleared his throat once again.  
明日香不知道该说什么，或者他是否在期待一个回答，所以她只是靠在真嗣的肩膀上，等待他继续。真嗣再次清了清喉咙。

"The only thing I can feel clearly, the only thing that makes me realize I'm alive, is the pain."  
"唯一能让我清晰感受到的，唯一让我意识到自己还活着的，就是疼痛。"

Then Shinji closed his eyes. A single tear escaped and trickled down around his ear. Asuka watched, speechless for a moment, but Shinji closed his mouth. He didn't say anything. He didn't do anything.  
随后，真嗣闭上了眼睛。一滴泪珠滑落，绕过他的耳畔。明日香注视着，一时无言，但真嗣紧闭双唇。他没有说任何话。也没有做任何事。

Asuka licked her lips once, swallowed, clenched and unclenched the hand that had been resting on his chest, then reached out with it to brush his bangs.  
明日香舔了舔嘴唇，咽了口唾沫，紧握又松开了原本搭在他胸口的手，然后伸出手去轻拂他的刘海。

"What about this? Can you feel it?"  
“这样呢？你能感觉到吗？”

To make sure, Asuka pressed herself against Shinji. A tingle ran down her upper body as her nipples, slightly hardened by the cool air, poked Shinji's arm.  
为了确认，明日香紧贴着真嗣。一阵酥麻感沿着她的上半身蔓延，她的乳头因凉风而微微挺立，触碰到了真嗣的手臂。

Shinji opened his eyes and looked back at Asuka. But that was all. With a strangely sad look in his eyes, Shinji was silent.  
真嗣睁开眼睛，回头看向明日香。但仅此而已。他的眼神中带着一种莫名的悲伤，真嗣沉默不语。

_I am part of the pain_. The thought cut sharp in Asuka's mind. _To Shinji, I am part of the pain, too. One of its sources._  
我是痛苦的一部分。这个念头在明日香心中划过，尖锐而清晰。对真嗣来说，我也是痛苦的一部分，是痛苦的来源之一。

_Idiot. He's saying that because he literally smashed his head into the plug hard enough to knock him out, and then he almost drowned. He's dazed and sore and feels weak. That's what he's talking about. This is real life, not some novel you were forced to read in school. Stop with that overanalyzing, interpretation nonsense. Your guilt is making things up, that's all. Not like you did anything that bad to him anyway.  
白痴。他这么说是因为他真的用力撞到了插头，撞得自己晕了过去，然后差点淹死。他现在头晕、疼痛，感觉虚弱。他就是这个意思。这是现实生活，不是你在学校被迫读的小说。别再过度分析，胡乱解读了。你的内疚让你在胡思乱想，仅此而已。反正你也没对他做过什么过分的事。_

Asuka shook her head to stifle the voices. Shinji still hadn't said anything, so Asuka filled in the blanks, feeling almost compelled to do so.  
明日香摇摇头，试图压制那些声音。真嗣还是一言不发，于是明日香几乎不由自主地填补了空白。

"I can give you something other than pain."  
“我可以给你除了痛苦之外的东西。”

Shinji's pupils widened slightly. "...Asuka?"  
真嗣的瞳孔微微放大。“……明日香？”

Asuka raised her upper body. Naturally, Shinji's gaze flicked downward once, then quickly shot up to her eyes. Asuka smiled, feeling again the satisfaction and excitement that usually warmed her lower belly whenever this kind of thing happened.  
明日香抬起上半身。自然地，真嗣的目光向下扫了一眼，随即迅速回到她的眼睛上。明日香微笑着，再次感受到每当这种事情发生时通常会在她小腹中燃起的满足和兴奋。

It was extremely clear to her what she was supposed to do now. What _they_ were supposed to do. It would sweep away the events that had piled up like so much pointless garbage. Even what Shinji just said eerily resonated with what she made up at school back on Monday. The thing that would make him feel alive. There really wasn't a more perfect answer. It was going to end both his current pain and their recent dissonance. The consummation that was long overdue.  
她非常清楚现在应该做什么，他们应该做什么。这将扫清那些堆积如无用垃圾的事件。甚至真嗣刚刚说的话也诡异地与她周一在学校编造的内容相呼应。那件能让他感到活着的事情。确实没有比这更完美的答案了。这将结束他当前的痛苦和他们最近的失调。这是久违的圆满。

Asuka put a hand in the dirt, but Shinji's hand came up and grabbed her shoulder. Asuka sent Shinji a questioning glance. He couldn't possibly reject her now, could he?  
明日香将手伸入泥土中，但真嗣的手却抬起抓住了她的肩膀。明日香投去询问的目光。他现在不可能拒绝她，对吧？

Her prediction was wrong again. Shinji shook his head. "It's okay. You don't have to do that for me, Asuka."  
她的预感再次错了。真嗣摇了摇头。“没关系。你不必为我这么做，明日香。”

Asuka let out a small groan. It was almost disappointing that he was still thinking this way. Why does he think it's only for him? Why couldn't he see that she wanted it too? Asuka almost said so, but at the last moment, a sudden sinking feeling in her stomach killed her confidence.  
明日香发出一声轻微的呻吟。他仍然这样想，几乎令人失望。为什么他认为这只是为了他？为什么他看不到她也想要呢？明日香几乎要说出口，但在最后一刻，她胃里突然下沉的感觉扼杀了她的信心。

Instead, Asuka shifted her gaze to Shinji's lower body. "I think he's got a different idea. Maybe you should give up. It's two to one."  
相反，明日香将目光转向了真嗣的下半身。“我觉得他有别的想法。或许你该放弃了。二对一。”

A groan came from her left. "I don't think we should hear his opinion on anything. His vote shouldn't count."  
她的左侧传来一声呻吟。“我觉得我们不该听他的意见。他的投票不该算数。”

She was almost irritated at this point. Why was he doing this even now? They came all this way. But, instead of showing annoyance, Asuka picked a better card, the line she thought about over the past few days.  
她几乎有些恼火了。为什么他到现在还要这样？他们已经走了这么远。但，明日香没有表现出不悦，而是选择了一张更好的牌，那句她过去几天一直在琢磨的话。

"Our promise," Asuka said through gritted teeth. "No matter what, I hate being owed something. I want to make sure this thing between us is settled before the end of the week."  
“我们的约定，”明日香咬牙切齿地说。“无论如何，我讨厌欠别人什么。我想确保我们之间的事情在这个周末前解决。”

With a flushing face, Asuka studied Shinji's reaction. His eyes were fluttering. His pale lips opened once, then closed again. Seeing that, she thought she won this now, and twisted her shoulder. Shinji's hand slipped away from her.  
明日香脸颊泛红，仔细观察着真嗣的反应。他的眼睛微微颤动，苍白的嘴唇张开了一次，然后又合上了。看到这一幕，她觉得自己现在赢了，扭动肩膀，真嗣的手从她身上滑落。

But that wasn't the last challenge, apparently. Leaning in toward Shinji's lower body, Asuka was rudely reminded that she had no idea how to handle this. At all.  
但显然，这还不是最后的挑战。明日香向真嗣的下身靠近，却突然意识到自己完全不知道该如何处理这种情况。一点头绪都没有。

The look of it alone was already disconcerting: a dark-colored, meaty rod with no curves or highlights except for a rough vein running up the middle. It made her cringe in disgust, honestly. Shinji's appearance was otherwise flawless except for this one thing. She wondered if something was wrong.  
光是这模样就够让人不安了：一根深色的、肉质的棒子，没有曲线或光泽，只有一条粗糙的脉络贯穿中间。她真心感到恶心，皱起了眉头。除了这一点，真嗣的外表其他方面都无可挑剔。她不禁怀疑是不是哪里出了问题。

The tip of it caught Asuka's eyes. It looked as if someone had tried to wrap an elongated object, but the wrapper wasn't long enough, leaving the contents slightly exposed at the very tip. She squinted. There was a hint of pink, an 'eye' staring at her from the center of it.  
顶端吸引了明日香的目光。看起来像是有人试图包裹一个细长的物体，但包装纸不够长，导致内容物在顶端略微暴露。她眯起眼睛，隐约看到一抹粉红色，仿佛一只“眼睛”从中心凝视着她。

If she peeled back that skin somehow, would it reveal a form she recognized from magazines? But surely she didn't have to do that. Surely it was there for a reason. If it needed to come off, wouldn't it do so when needed without her having to jerk it this way and that? Not like it was a gun slider where you have to pull before use.  
如果她设法剥开那层皮，会不会露出她在杂志上见过的那种形状？但她肯定不必这么做。那东西存在必有其道理。如果需要脱落，难道不是在必要时自行脱落，而不需要她这样来回折腾吗？又不是枪的滑套，使用前还得先拉一下。

She tried to remember what Shinji had done the last time he tried to put that thing inside her, but nothing came to mind. Asuka had been so excited back then that the moment was a blur now. Asuka snorted in defiance.  
她试图回忆上次真嗣试图将那东西放入她体内时做了什么，但脑海中一片空白。那时明日香太过兴奋，如今那瞬间已模糊不清。明日香不屑地哼了一声。

_It can't be that hard. Just put it in my mouth, then suck it up like a straw. Or maybe I really should pull that thing back first like a pistol.  
应该不会太难。只要把它放进我嘴里，然后像吸管一样吸上来。或者我确实应该先像拉动手枪一样把它拉回来。_

Asuka made up her mind and leaned down, her hands almost in position, when Shinji reached out again and touched her shoulder.  
明日香下定决心，俯下身去，双手几乎就位，这时真嗣再次伸出手，触碰了她的肩膀。

"Asuka. Stop. It hurts. A lot."  
"明日香。停下。很疼。非常疼。"

Asuka blinked for a moment, Shinji's words totally unintelligible. At first she wondered what the hell was he talking about, if he was freaking out again and looking for an excuse to stop, but his stuttering words and squeaky voice really did sound like he was hurting somewhere.  
明日香愣了一下，真嗣的话完全让她摸不着头脑。起初她以为他又在发神经，找借口停下来，但他的结巴和尖细的声音听起来真的像是哪里疼。

"But, but I didn't do anything..."  
"但是，但是我什么都没做啊……"

Shinji let out a groan and pointed to his chest.  
真嗣发出一声呻吟，指着自己的胸口。

"Not there. Here. Looking at you. Made me breathe faster. Then it started to hurt. A lot. Like a stab. In the chest."  
“不是那里。是这里。看着你。让我呼吸加快。然后就开始疼。很疼。像被刺了一样。在胸口。”

"Ah." Asuka immediately thought of a certain possibility. She hastily dragged her legs to the side of Shinji's chest, dirt and grass already paved by her knees due to her CPR position.  
“啊。”明日香立刻想到了某种可能性。她急忙将双腿拖到真嗣胸旁，由于心肺复苏的姿势，膝盖下已是泥土和草地。

_You gotta be kidding me._ "I think I broke your ribs. I didn't feel it. I didn't hear it. But maybe I just didn't notice."  
你一定是在开玩笑吧。“我觉得我可能弄断了你的肋骨。我没感觉到，也没听到。但也许我只是没注意到。”

Shinji's body visibly shrank, and the eyes looking up at her shook so pitifully, that Asuka felt almost compelled to keep talking.  
真嗣的身体明显地缩了一下，他抬头看她的眼神如此可怜，以至于明日香几乎不由自主地继续说了下去。

"Don't freak out! It happens all the time with CPR, or so they say! If it pierced your lung or a heart or something it could be serious, but if that happened we would've known from the start."  
“别慌！这种情况在心肺复苏时经常发生，至少他们是这么说的！如果刺穿了肺或心脏什么的，那可能会很严重，但如果那样的话我们一开始就会知道了。”

For a moment, Asuka thought about pressing down his chest and side to see where exactly he was hurt, but realized that would be pointless.  
有那么一刻，明日香考虑过按压他的胸口和侧边，看看他究竟伤在哪里，但随即意识到这样做毫无意义。

Asuka sighed. There was nothing they could do now, she supposed. She lifted Shinji's arm, slipped under it, and rested her head on his shoulder. She was careful not to press against his chest or side.  
明日香叹了口气。她想，现在他们什么也做不了。她抬起真嗣的手臂，钻到下面，将头靠在他的肩上。她小心翼翼地避免压到他的胸口或侧边。

Shinji seemed to be thinking the same thing Asuka considered for a moment. "Asuka, is it okay? To do nothing?"  
真嗣似乎也在思考明日香刚才考虑的事情。“明日香，这样什么都不做，可以吗？”

Asuka resisted the urge to snort. Not everyone can be a well-trained elite pilot.  
明日香忍住了嗤之以鼻的冲动。不是每个人都能成为训练有素的精英驾驶员。

"Yeah, it's okay. I'm sure even Akagi wouldn't be able to do anything for you. It's not like you could cast your ribs or anything. And they're easily healed naturally. You'll just need to rest and wait."  
“嗯，没事的。我相信即使是赤木律子也帮不了你什么。又不是你能自己接骨什么的。而且它们自然愈合起来很容易。你只需要休息和等待。”

"Ah."

With a sigh, Asuka pressed herself against Shinji's lean frame. He was still cold. She wanted to wrap her arms around him and hug him tightly, to warm him up, but she couldn't press his chest like that. She could only hope that being glued to his side like this would help.  
叹了口气，明日香紧贴着真嗣瘦削的身体。他依然冰冷。她想张开双臂紧紧拥抱他，给他温暖，但她不能那样压着他的胸口。她只能寄希望于这样紧贴在他身边能有所帮助。

Shinji's body shook slightly, then he winced with a groan. Only after a moment Asuka realized Shinji had laughed.  
真嗣的身体微微颤抖，随后他呻吟着皱起了眉。直到片刻后，明日香才意识到真嗣笑了。

"What's wrong?" "怎么了？"

Shinji cleared his throat, then gave Asuka's shoulder a slight squeeze. "Here. I planned a date with you. This place."  
真嗣清了清嗓子，然后轻轻捏了捏明日香的肩膀。“这里。我计划和你约会的地方。”

"You wanted to bring me here?"  
“你想带我来这里？”

Shinji gave a small nod. Asuka turned her head and looked around. As she thought some minutes ago, the view wasn't half bad. And it would be silent even in the daytime, reasonably far from the center of human activities. Which meant they could do whatever they wanted with no one to disturb them.  
真嗣轻轻点了点头。明日香转过头，环顾四周。正如她几分钟前所想，这景色并不算差。而且即使在白天也很安静，离人类活动中心相当远。这意味着他们可以随心所欲，无人打扰。

A small sigh. "Walking together. Holding hands. A picnic. Maybe lying down. Watching the lake. I never imagined it would happen like this, though."  
轻轻叹了口气。“一起散步。手牵手。野餐。也许躺下来。看湖。虽然我从没想过会这样发生。”

"You had all those things planned out?" Asuka didn't like the watery sound of her voice. She thought it was ridiculous that she was so moved by this simple thing, but she couldn't help it.  
“你把所有这些都计划好了？”明日香不喜欢自己声音中那含糊不清的感觉。她觉得为这种简单的事情如此感动很可笑，但她控制不住自己。

"Well," Shinji opened his mouth, then swallowed. There was a strange glint in his eyes in the place of the warmth that had filled them just moments ago. Just as Asuka was wondering what she was seeing, or if she was really seeing anything at all, it all washed away and the warmth returned.  
"嗯，" 真嗣张开嘴，又咽了回去。他的眼中闪过一丝奇异的光芒，取代了片刻前还充盈其中的温暖。就在明日香疑惑自己看到了什么，或者是否真的看到了什么时，一切又都消散了，温暖重新回归。

"Asuka, will you come here with me next time?"  
"明日香，下次你能和我一起来吗？"

_Whenever you want,_ the words rose to Asuka's mouth and stopped at the last moment. The more she rolled it around in her head, the more she realized she meant it, but it sounded stupid. So she hesitated, then kissed Shinji's shoulder once. "If you'll let me come on you. No buts. No strings attached."  
无论何时，这句话涌到明日香嘴边，却在最后一刻停住了。她越想越觉得这是真心话，但听起来很傻。于是她犹豫了一下，然后轻轻吻了真嗣的肩膀一下。"如果你愿意让我加入，我就会来。不许反悔，不带任何条件。"

Shinji's body jerked once. A groan escaped his mouth, teeth clenched.  
真嗣的身体猛地一颤。他紧咬牙关，发出一声呻吟。

"...Asuka. Don't make me laugh. Please."  
“……明日香，别逗我笑了。求你了。”

"Then can I do something else?"  
“那我可以做点别的吗？”

Asuka smiled, and so did Shinji. Their eyes met. Asuka knew what he wanted, and so did Shinji.  
明日香微笑着，真嗣也笑了。他们的目光相遇。明日香知道他想要什么，真嗣也知道。

They tilted their heads and kissed.  
他们倾斜着头，轻轻地吻在一起。

Unlike the last kiss that had begun so abruptly and ended even more abruptly, this one was slow and languid, as if they were both trying to take in every last bit of what they hadn't tasted in the past few days. And Asuka didn't want it to become too intense, afraid Shinji would hurt again.  
与上一次突如其来又戛然而止的吻不同，这一次缓慢而慵懒，仿佛他们都在试图汲取过去几天里未曾尝到的每一丝滋味。而明日香不想让它变得过于激烈，担心真嗣会再次受伤。

And then, as if in direct objection to Asuka's thoughts, Shinji's hand came up and cupped her breast hard. A stab of pleasure bloomed through her upper body as his cold palm rubbed her hardened nipple. Asuka moaned hotly into Shinji's throat and entwined her legs around his. Shinji's tautly erect cock poked at her thigh. Shinji let out a groan and released his grip on her breast. Asuka pulled her hips back slightly, slowing her offensive.  
随后，仿佛直接反驳明日香的想法一般，真嗣的手抬起，用力握住了她的乳房。他的冷手掌摩擦着她硬挺的乳头，一股快感在她上半身蔓延开来。明日香热切地呻吟着，紧贴着真嗣的喉咙，双腿缠绕在他身上。真嗣紧绷挺立的阴茎抵在她的腿上。真嗣发出一声呻吟，松开了对她的抓握。明日香微微后退臀部，放缓了攻势。

The smoldering bowl of pleasure was passed back and forth between them, slow and easy. But then Asuka's jaw began to ache and Shinji's breathing became ragged again. So they stopped and lay there, holding each other tightly. Both had reached the limit of their strength anyway.  
那充满快感的碗在他们之间来回传递，缓慢而轻松。但随后明日香的下巴开始酸痛，真嗣的呼吸也再次变得急促。于是他们停了下来，紧紧相拥。无论如何，两人都已经达到了体力的极限。

As the effects of the adrenaline rush finally subsided, Asuka felt a fatigue that she never experienced before. Her arms and back started to ache, and her whole body felt mellow. Unable to move, Asuka buried her face in Shinji's shoulder and stayed still. Beneath the smells of earth and grass and the faint LCL that lingered even now, Asuka also smelled Shinji's own scent, and it felt like a sleeping pill to her right now. She wondered if he could smell her too, and what he thought of it.  
随着肾上腺素激增的效果终于消退，明日香感受到了前所未有的疲惫。她的手臂和背部开始酸痛，整个身体都变得软绵绵的。无法动弹的明日香将脸埋在真嗣的肩膀上，静静地待着。在泥土和草地的气息以及至今仍萦绕不去的 LCL 气味之下，明日香还闻到了真嗣独有的气息，这感觉就像是对她此刻的安眠药。她想知道他是否也能闻到她的气味，以及他会怎么想。

Come to think of it, maybe they couldn't afford to waste their time together like this. Of all the problems that happened between them, none of them had been resolved. Maybe they should start having the hard talk, facing the hard truth, instead of napping like this. But Asuka wanted to leave it at that for now, to enjoy each other's warmth without thinking or talking.  
转念一想，也许他们没有时间这样浪费在一起。他们之间发生的所有问题，一个都没有解决。也许他们应该开始进行艰难的对话，面对残酷的现实，而不是像这样打盹。但明日香现在只想这样，享受彼此的温暖，不思考也不交谈。

That way, she wouldn't have to tell Shinji that he was an existential threat to her. That when he fell to the lake earlier, she, even if it was for a moment, really thought that she could become the best pilot again if Shinji was gone for good. That way, she wouldn't need to face those truths.  
那样的话，她就不必告诉真嗣，他是她的存在性威胁。当他在湖中坠落时，即使只是一瞬间，她真的以为如果真嗣永远消失，她就能再次成为最优秀的驾驶员。那样的话，她就不需要面对这些真相。

**Saturday, 01:22. Terminal Dogma  
星期六，01:22。最终教条区**

There was no other lighting in the room besides that from the tank. It coated everything in an ominous orange hue. A man was silhouetted in front of it, stark against the light. Just as Ritsuko had expected, he was standing in front of the tank's control panel. Ristuko, for a moment, forgot what had brought her down here in such a hurry, and was seized by a familiar feeling of hatred.  
房间内除了水槽的光别无其他照明，一切都被笼罩在阴森的橙色光晕中。一个男人在水槽前的剪影鲜明地映衬着灯光。正如律子所料，他正站在水槽控制面板前。律子一时忘了自己为何如此匆忙地来到这里，被一股熟悉的憎恨感所攫住。

_Your precious dolls are managed by their own system, completely separate from the MAGI mainframe, so they were never threatened even when 96% of the entire system fell to the Angel, so cut the crap.  
你那些珍贵的玩偶由独立系统管理，完全与 MAGI 主框架分离，所以即便整个系统 96%被使徒攻陷，它们也从未受到威胁，别再胡扯了。_

Ritsuko wanted to say all those things, but she didn't. Because she didn't want to show him how much these dolls could affect her feelings, how much she was conscious of them.  
律子本想说那些话，但她没有。因为她不想让他看到这些玩偶能多大程度影响她的情绪，她有多在意它们。

Instead, Ritsuko decided to add a bit of a tangent before going into her main business.  
相反，律子决定在进入正题前先绕个小弯。

"Did you know that your son was at death's door and barely managed to come back?"  
“你知道你儿子曾命悬一线，好不容易才挺过来吗？”

Gendo didn't even pretend to listen, just leisurely pushed a few buttons on the panel. Ritsuko paused before continuing. "Asuka - I mean, the pilot of Unit-02 -gave him quite a rough ride, it seems. Sternum fracture. Concussion. Well, nothing too serious, but still."  
源堂连装作听的样子都没有，只是悠闲地在控制面板上按了几下。律子顿了顿，继续说道：“明日香——我是说，二号机的驾驶员——似乎让他吃了不少苦头。胸骨骨折。脑震荡。嗯，虽然不算太严重，但还是……”

Gendo's hand stopped. Not because of the information Ritsuko had just shared, but probably because he finished the command he meant to enter into the panel. He looked back at Ritsuko with a small snort.  
源堂的手停了下来。并非因为律子刚刚分享的信息，大概只是因为他已经完成了打算输入面板的指令。他回头看向律子，轻轻哼了一声。

"Would you believe it if I told you that Soryu was a little strange even before she was hospitalized? I guess the apple didn't fall far from the tree."  
“如果我告诉你，索伦在住院之前就有点古怪，你会相信吗？看来这苹果并没有掉得太远。”

Ritsuko walked over to stand beside him and shrugged. Dr. Soryu of the Berlin branch was a figure from a time before Ritsuko joined GEHIRN, so she didn't have much of a personal impression of her.  
律子走过去站在他旁边，耸了耸肩。柏林分部的碇唯博士是律子加入 GEHIRN 之前的人物，所以她对她的个人印象并不多。

Gendo cut in, not giving Ritsuko any more chance to go on about non-essential matters. "How did the recovery go? Is it possible?"  
源渡打断了她，不给律子更多机会谈论无关紧要的事情。"恢复情况如何？有可能吗？"

Ritsuko chewed her lip. The losses suffered by NERV in today's 'battle' were beyond human comprehension, though only three people would ever know it.  
律子咬着嘴唇。NERV 在今天的'战斗'中所遭受的损失超出了人类的理解范围，尽管只有三个人会知道这一切。

"No. Just like every data from the Angel-controlled sector, it was tainted at the logic stage. We had no choice but to destroy it."  
"不，就像天使控制区域的所有数据一样，它在逻辑阶段就被污染了。我们别无选择，只能销毁它。"

"How long would it take to rebuild it to a similar level?"  
"重建到相似水平需要多长时间？"

"We can avoid most of the errors we went through in the initial development. My expectation is we could compress it down to a third of the time it took before."  
"我们可以避免在初始开发中遇到的大多数错误。我预计我们可以将时间压缩到之前的三分之一。"

Gendo was silent for a moment. It was his way of processing the shocking news. A third of the previous time, on the surface, sounded like a fairly optimistic figure. But in this case, it meant that the timeline laid out in the Dead Sea Scrolls would be impossible to meet. By the time it would be rebuilt, there would be no one left to use it, or need it, for that matter. The dummy system was as good as dead.  
源渡沉默了一会儿。这是他在处理令人震惊的消息时的方式。表面上，三分之一的时间听起来像是一个相当乐观的数字。但在这种情况下，这意味着《死海古卷》中规划的时间线将无法实现。等到重建完成时，将没有人能够使用它，或者说，没有人需要它。这个虚拟系统已经形同虚设。

Of course, even now, all the key points of the system were still fresh in Ritsuko's mind and working notes. But those were no substitute for the dizzying levels of computing power required to simulate the human soul as a function, and the enormous amount of data that was generated as a result.  
当然，即便现在，系统所有关键点仍然清晰地留在律子的脑海中和工作笔记里。但这些都无法替代模拟人类灵魂作为功能所需的令人眩晕的计算能力水平，以及由此产生的大量数据。

Ritsuko managed to save the physical MAGI system itself, but the crucial data that Gendo wanted to save was gone. For good.  
律子设法保存了 MAGI 系统的实体本身，但源渡想要保存的关键数据已经永远消失了。

It was common sense to have double and triple safety measures for a project that was this important. Physical copies and backups. But in this case, those weren't an option, so Ritsuko didn't even mention it. The HQ MAGI's backup was stored in the Matsushiro base, and there was no way they could send something as sensitive as the Dummy System development files there. The leak of the system itself wasn't even the problem; if it fell into the hands of someone who knew where to look and what to find, the Ayanami Project, the theoretical basis for the Dummy System, could also be exposed. That was not an outcome they wanted to risk. As for physical copies, making an independent storage unit that was separate from the MAGI mainframe was a problem, and such a thing would be too vulnerable to infiltration. Any situation resulting in the MAGI mainframe falling into the enemy's hands was unthinkable from the start.  
对于如此重要的项目，采取双重甚至三重安全措施是常识。实体副本和备份。但在这种情况下，这些都不是选项，所以律子甚至没有提及。总部 MAGI 的备份存储在松代基地，他们不可能将像 Dummy 系统开发文件这样敏感的东西发送到那里。系统本身的泄露还不是问题；如果落入知道在哪里查找和找到什么的人手中，绫波计划，Dummy 系统的理论基础，也可能被曝光。这不是他们想要冒险的结果。至于实体副本，制作一个独立于 MAGI 主机的存储单元是一个问题，这样的东西太容易受到渗透。任何导致 MAGI 主机落入敌人手中的情况从一开始就是不可想象的。

Revisiting those points, Ritsuko waited for Gendo's reaction. A doll passed in front of them, serene and lifeless. The sound of the motor echoed quietly. Gendo looked up, his clothes rustling.  
回顾这些要点，律子等待着源度的反应。一个玩偶从他们面前经过，宁静而无生气。马达的声音轻轻回响。源度抬起头，衣服沙沙作响。

"We should send the letter to the Nevada branch."  
“我们应该把信发送到内华达分部。”

### Chapter 19 Unimportant things

Shinji was always a shallow sleeper.  
真嗣总是浅眠。

It was not uncommon for him to wake up at the slightest sound or stimulus, even in the middle of a deep sleep. And it was a rare thing for him to be unaware of someone entering his sleeping space while he slept. He never knew why. Maybe he was just naturally sensitive, or maybe his body was so accustomed to the dead quiet of his teacher's house that it overreacted to anything louder than that. Or maybe the quality of his sleep was chronically poor, and he wasn't really sleeping deeply ever. Anyway, since it was a regular thing that happened all the time, Shinji was not really surprised after waking up in the darkness and silence of his room. Instead, he reflexively looked around for the culprit.  
他常常在轻微的声响或刺激下醒来，即便是在深度睡眠中也不例外。而他在熟睡时对有人进入他的睡眠空间毫无察觉，这种情况实属罕见。他从未明白其中缘由。或许他天生敏感，又或许他的身体早已习惯了导师家中死寂般的安静，以至于对任何比这更响的声音都过度反应。再或者，他的睡眠质量长期不佳，实际上从未真正深睡过。无论如何，既然这是时常发生的事，真嗣在黑暗与寂静中醒来时并不感到惊讶。相反，他本能地环顾四周，寻找罪魁祸首。

The 'search' took only a fraction of a second. Because the alien presence that shouldn't have been in this room was now lying in his bed, asserting itself with its smell, weight, and heat.  
这个'搜索'仅用了一瞬间。因为那个本不该出现在这个房间的外来存在，此刻正躺在他的床上，以其气味、重量和体温宣示着自己的存在。

Shinji didn't mind the first two, but the last one was a bit too much. His room, with no air conditioning or even a window, sometimes got uncomfortable for him to sleep in all on his own. Another warm body just made things worse. So Shinji gingerly pushed himself up. Asuka mumbled something unintelligible, her arms sliding gently away from him. He found it kind of cute, so he smiled and stroked her hair a little, careful not to wake her up.  
真嗣对前两点并不介意，但最后一点就有点过头了。他的房间没有空调，甚至连窗户都没有，有时独自一人睡在里面会感到不舒服。多一个温暖的躯体只会让情况更糟。于是真嗣小心翼翼地坐起身来。明日香咕哝着什么听不清的话，双臂轻轻地从他身上滑落。他觉得这挺可爱的，便笑了笑，轻轻抚摸她的头发，生怕吵醒她。

The room must have been hot for Asuka too. She must have sweated a bit, since her scent wafted faintly in the warm, damp air between them. It wasn't unpleasant or particularly overpowering. He didn't mind it much yesterday night either, when it was much stronger than it was now. Asuka's scent, like its owner's heart, was an almost imperceptible undertone, masked by the sweet, artificial smells of shampoo and body wash. Something you could easily miss if you weren't paying attention.  
房间对明日香来说一定也很热。她肯定也出了点汗，因为她的气息在温暖潮湿的空气中隐约飘散在他们之间。这并不难闻，也没有特别强烈。昨晚当它比现在强烈得多时，他也不太介意。明日香的气息，就像她内心的写照，是一种几乎难以察觉的底色，被洗发水和沐浴露的甜美人工香味所掩盖。如果你不注意，很容易就会忽略掉。

Smiling helplessly at his own thoughts, Shinji looked down at Asuka. His pain. His joy. The same tranquil face he'd seen in the lounge that morning, so peaceful and guileless that it was hard to find any trace of savage storms. She was lying next to him now as if the past few days had not happened at all. Suddenly, sharply, Shinji wished that all the nonsense like school, Evangelion, and Angels would fade away, so that this languid, painkiller-ridden, hazy dawn would go on forever, and he would never have to give up the warmth and smell of the girl next to him.  
无奈地对着自己的思绪微笑，真嗣低头看着明日香。他的痛苦。他的喜悦。那天早晨在休息室里看到的同样宁静无邪的面庞，难以找到任何狂暴风暴的痕迹。她现在躺在他身边，仿佛过去几天从未发生过。突然间，真嗣强烈地希望学校、福音战士和使徒这些纷扰都消失，让这个充满止痛药气息、朦胧的黎明永远持续下去，他永远不必放弃身边女孩的温暖和气息。

But he knew such a thing was impossible. Morning would come and sweep it away under a tide of alarms and breakfasts and calls to hurry up. And…  
但他知道这是不可能的。早晨会到来，将这一切在闹钟、早餐和催促声的浪潮下扫除。而且……

_How long could this peace last?_ As soon as he asked himself the question, the answer came to him immediately. _Until the next sync test?_  
这份宁静能持续多久？他一问自己这个问题，答案立刻浮现。直到下一次同步测试？

All the pleasant feelings washed away in an instant, replaced by a suffocating sensation he had almost forgotten. The thought that had flashed through his mind last night as he dozed off between the cool lake breeze and Asuka's fiery body resurfaced. Nothing had been resolved between her and him. It was just forgotten in last night's whirlwind of unanticipated chaos. The bomb's detonator was still intact, still threatening them and their relationship. Catastrophe, suspended for a moment.  
所有愉悦的感受瞬间被冲刷殆尽，取而代之的是一种几乎被遗忘的窒息感。昨晚在清凉的湖风与明日香炽热的身躯间半梦半醒时闪过的念头再次浮现。他们之间的问题并未得到解决。只是昨晚突如其来的混乱风暴暂时掩盖了这一切。那颗炸弹的引信依旧完好，依旧威胁着他们及他们的关系。灾难，只是暂时悬停。

And Shinji didn't know what to do when that bomb finally went off once more.  
而真嗣不知道当那颗炸弹再次引爆时，他该如何应对。

_I don't want to fight again. I don't want to do that whole thing again.  
我不想再战斗了。我不想再经历那一切了。_

He was never comfortable at the height of their cold war, but now that he was surrounded by her warmth again, the idea of losing it and going back to the way things were felt like the last thing he wanted to do. He didn't want to go back to avoiding each other's eyes and never talking when _this_ was the alternative. It was only a few days, objectively, but the stress and pressure Shinji felt from that period made it feel like almost a month.  
在那场冷战的高峰期，他从未感到自在，但如今再次被她的温暖环绕，失去这一切并回到从前状态的想法，成了他最不愿面对的事。他不想再回到那种避开彼此目光、无言以对的境地，尤其是当现在有了这样的替代选择。从客观上讲，那只是几天时间，但那段时期施加在真嗣身上的压力和紧张感，却让它仿佛近似一个月般漫长。

But how? 但该怎么做呢？

Should he ask Ms. Ritsuko and Ms. Misato to put Asuka first in all situations from now on, and not to offend her unnecessarily like what happened yesterday? To be honest, yesterday was a surprise for Shinji, too. He didn't expect Ms. Ritsuko of all people to throw fuel on the fire that was his and Asuka's recent fight. Shinji did _not_ appreciate that, and honestly hoped that such a thing would never happen again. But it was stupid, to say the least, for him to request something like that of them. And it didn't seem like something Asuka would appreciate either.  
他是否应该请求律子小姐和美里小姐从今往后在所有情况下都将明日香放在首位，并避免像昨天那样不必要的冒犯她？说实话，昨天对真嗣来说也是个意外。他没想到，偏偏是律子小姐会在他和明日香最近的争执上火上浇油。真嗣对此并不感激，老实说，他希望这样的事情再也不要发生。但至少可以说，他向她们提出这样的请求是愚蠢的。而且，这似乎也不是明日香会欣赏的做法。

Then what, would he have to lose to Asuka every time there was a synchronization test? He didn't even know why his sync rate took off in the first place. It wasn't like a school test where you could deliberately pick the wrong answers. He couldn't lower his sync rate even if he wanted to.  
那么，每次同步测试他都得输给明日香吗？他甚至不知道自己的同步率为何会突然飙升。这不像学校考试，你可以故意选错答案。即使他想降低同步率也做不到。

And, feasibility aside, was it right? Was it something he wanted to do?  
而且，抛开可行性不谈，这样做对吗？这是他想要的吗？

His intuition and emotions were giving him a very immediate and strong _no._ It wasn't right. It didn't make sense to him to consciously give in and give up to Asuka in something like this. He was not her subordinate or anything like that.  
他的直觉和情感强烈地告诉他不行。这样做不对。在类似的事情上故意屈服和放弃给明日香，对他来说毫无道理。他不是她的下属，也不是那种关系。

It was the voice of reason in his mind that made Shinji hesitate.  
正是他脑海中理性的声音让真嗣犹豫了。

_It's not like Eva's that important to you. You were scared and only started doing this because your father forced you. Why obsess over being good at something you don't even like? What's the point? Why does it even matter to you?  
这不像是对你那么重要的 Eva。你害怕，只是因为父亲强迫你才开始做这件事。为什么要执着于擅长自己不喜欢的东西呢？有什么意义？为什么对你来说这还重要？_

Those words sounded right. Their logic was flawless. But they felt terribly wrong. He grimaced.  
这些话听起来没错，逻辑无懈可击。但感觉却非常不对劲。他皱起了眉头。

_Piloting Eva, fighting Angels, all of it, you told her you're doing all that just for her. You made such a big deal about it. Was that a lie, too? Do you think it makes sense to make her suffer for things you're supposedly doing for her?  
驾驶 Eva，对抗使徒，这一切，你告诉她你做这些全是为了她。你把这看得如此重要。那也是谎言吗？你认为让她为这些你所谓的为她做的事受苦，有意义吗？_

The thought stung. Shinji squeezed his eyes shut.  
这个念头刺痛了他。真嗣紧闭双眼。

No matter how he tried to spin it, it wasn't his fault. The specifics of Asuka's feelings did not matter. She had no reason to feel that way, and she had no reason to act the way she'd been either. This whole thing was Asuka being unreasonable, and Shinji couldn't understand it.  
无论他如何试图解释，这都不是他的错。明日香的感情细节并不重要。她没有理由那样感觉，也没有理由像她一直那样行动。这一切都是明日香在无理取闹，而真嗣无法理解。

_Did you try to understand her, though?  
但你有没有试着去理解她呢？_

Shinji's eyes snapped open. The sight of Asuka's peaceful face as she slept, breathing softly through her slightly open mouth, was almost enough to make him feel a little better. Almost. A resentment he had nearly forgotten in the heat of passion threatened to boil over again.  
真嗣的眼睛猛地睁开。看到明日香熟睡时平静的面容，她微微张着嘴轻柔地呼吸，这几乎让他感觉好了一点。几乎。在激情中几乎被遗忘的怨恨再次威胁要爆发。

_Why is it always me? Why do I have to be the one to understand and make concessions every time? Why does everything have to go the way Asuka wants? Why does she never do the same for me?  
为什么总是我？为什么每次都得我去理解和让步？为什么一切都得按明日香的意思来？为什么她从不为我做同样的事？_

Shinji's mind came up with the answer much faster than he thought possible. It was as if it had been waiting for this very question.  
真嗣的脑海中迅速得出了答案，速度之快超乎他的想象。仿佛这个问题一直在等待着被提出。

_No, she's already giving you enough. The hugs, the kisses, lying next to you like this, the whole relationship, it's all a big concession on her part. You enjoy all of these things only because she's willing to give them to you. You should really be grateful. You should know who's at a disadvantage in this relationship.  
不，她已经给了你很多。拥抱、亲吻，像这样躺在你身边，整个关系，这一切都是她做出的巨大让步。你享受这一切只是因为她愿意给予你。你真的应该心存感激。你应该明白在这段关系中谁处于劣势。_

Feelings of inferiority and defeat were something familiar to Shinji, but having a girl he liked at the center of them was something he'd never experienced before. It made things substantially worse than usual.  
自卑和挫败感对真嗣来说并不陌生，但有一个他喜欢的女孩处于这一切的中心，却是他从未经历过的。这让情况比平时糟糕得多。

_Does she not like me as much as I like her? Am I being desperate? Does she do what she does because she didn't put her heart into this relationship the way I did?  
难道她不像我喜欢她那样喜欢我吗？我是不是太迫切了？她之所以那样做，是不是因为她没有像我这样全心全意地投入这段关系？_

But that didn't seem right. Not just in Shinji's wistful thoughts but also from an objective point of view. Shinji thought of the face he'd seen yesterday. A side of her he'd never seen or imagined. Her face contorted in pain, in tears. All of it because she thought she'd lost him. It was something that couldn't happen if Shinji was not dear to her.  
但这似乎不对。不仅在真嗣的忧郁思绪中，而且从客观角度来看也是如此。真嗣想起了昨天看到的那张脸。一个他从未见过或想象过的侧面。她的脸因痛苦而扭曲，泪流满面。这一切都是因为她以为失去了他。如果真嗣对她不重要，这种事是不会发生的。

_Yeah, maybe you're right, but that's the extent of it. You're still not important enough for her to compromise for. She probably likes you, but there's limits to it.  
是啊，也许你是对的，但也就到此为止了。你对她来说还不够重要，不足以让她妥协。她可能喜欢你，但也有个限度。_

That seemed to freeze Shinji's tentatively-warming heart. Everything was brought back to square one.  
这似乎让真嗣刚刚回暖的心再次冻结。一切又回到了原点。

_So, what would happen if I jumped on her like I did back then?  
那么，如果我像那时一样跳到她身上，会发生什么呢？_

Fascinated by the sudden thought, Shinji glanced over at Asuka. The girl had burst into his room last night when Shinji, freshly washed and thoroughly tired, was about to fall asleep. Her hair was loose, without the neural clips that usually adorned it. She was wearing a baggy t-shirt that stopped almost halfway down her thighs. Shinji had seen much more of her lately, but that didn't make the sight any less arousing.  
被这个突如其来的念头所吸引，真嗣瞥了一眼明日香。昨晚，当真嗣刚洗完澡、疲惫不堪，正要入睡时，女孩突然闯进了他的房间。她的头发散开，没有平时戴的神经夹。她穿着一件宽松的 T 恤，长度几乎到大腿中部。最近真嗣已经见过她更多的一面，但这并没有让眼前的景象减少半分诱惑力。

But the feeling behind the impulse was not simple carnal desire. Well, not completely.  
但这种冲动背后的情感并非单纯的肉欲。嗯，并不完全是。

What Shinji really desired was the end of the torturous uncertainty and frustration that had been plaguing them. He wanted all of it to go away. And when he thought about it, when they were engulfed in the heat and feelings of each other's bodies, groping and tasting, there were no doubts, no insecurities. All of those unpleasant things were burned away in the scalding flames of raw, honest desire.  
碇真嗣真正渴望的是结束那折磨人的不确定性和挫败感。他希望这一切都消失。当他思考这一点时，当他们被彼此身体的热度和情感所包围，摸索和品尝时，没有疑虑，没有不安全感。所有那些不愉快的东西都在炽热的、真诚的欲望之火中被烧毁了。

Shinji now understood why Asuka kept pushing this issue non-stop.  
真嗣现在明白了为什么明日香一直不停地推动这个问题。

Asuka was smart. Smart enough to realize that, from the start, there would be communication issues between them. She probably wanted to make sure that everything was in place before they inevitably faced those hard issues. And if Shinji had gone along with what Asuka wanted, there might have been a simpler solution to the problems that had been bogging them down recently. Shinji was beginning to regret his past decisions.  
明日香很聪明。聪明到从一开始就意识到他们之间会存在沟通问题。她大概想确保一切就绪，以便在不可避免地面对那些棘手问题之前做好准备。如果真嗣能顺着明日香的意思去做，或许近期困扰他们的那些问题会有更简单的解决办法。真嗣开始后悔自己过去的决定。

But such a conclusion was short-lived. Doubt engulfed Shinji once again.  
但这样的结论转瞬即逝。疑虑再次吞噬了真嗣。

_Is it really right? That we can't have the conversations we need to have and just touch each other instead? If Asuka and I did... that, and then another fight broke out afterwards, what would we do? What am I supposed to do with her then?  
这样真的对吗？我们不能进行必要的对话，只能通过肢体接触来解决问题？如果明日香和我那样做了，之后又爆发了争吵，我们该怎么办？那时我该如何面对她？_

Shinji reached out and stroked Asuka's hair. Asuka did not respond. She was deeply asleep.  
真嗣伸出手，轻抚着明日香的头发。明日香没有反应。她正沉沉地睡着。

What was right and what was wrong? What was normal, and what was not? What should lovers compromise on, and what should they not? Were there an easy way out, or a simple guide, or something, _anything,_ for all of these issues?  
何为对，何为错？何为正常，何为不正常？恋人之间应该在哪些方面妥协，哪些方面又不能？是否存在简单的解决之道，或是简易指南，抑或是任何能解答这些问题的东西？

No one in Shinji's life had ever warned him about anything like this. There was no one to teach him. No one to even tell him problems like this existed. And it wasn't like he had any example to follow, or anyone to ask for guidance.  
在真嗣的生命中，从未有人警告过他这类事情。没有人教过他。甚至没有人告诉他这些问题是存在的。而且，他也没有任何榜样可以效仿，或是任何人可以寻求指引。

_I wonder if this happened to Father. Between him and Mother.  
我在想，父亲和母亲之间是否也发生过类似的事情。_

The thought, popping up suddenly, made him strangely uncomfortable. More than it probably should. It was a little unpleasant, even, so he pushed it out of his mind and looked down at Asuka again.  
这个突然冒出的念头让他感到莫名的不安，甚至比他预想的还要强烈。这让他有些不快，于是他努力将这个想法抛诸脑后，再次低头看向明日香。

Shinji leaned in, deciding that he could at least kiss her forehead even if he couldn't decide on anything more than that, when a familiar voice came from the doorway.  
真嗣俯下身，决定至少可以亲吻她的额头，尽管他无法决定除此之外的任何事情，这时一个熟悉的声音从门口传来。

"Shinji." "真嗣。"

Shinji froze at the sound of Ms. Misato's quiet voice. He thought he hadn't sensed anything, but on second thought it might have been her eyes, peeking through the slightly open doorway right now, that woke him up in the first place. A hand was raised right beneath her calm face, gesturing slightly. It took a few seconds for Shinji to realize what it meant and slid out of bed, cautiously so as to not wake Asuka up.  
听到美里小姐轻柔的声音，真嗣僵住了。他原以为自己什么也没察觉，但转念一想，或许正是她透过半掩的门缝窥视的目光，才将他唤醒。她平静的面容下，一只手微微抬起，示意着什么。真嗣花了好几秒才明白她的意思，小心翼翼地从床上滑下来，生怕吵醒明日香。

Ms. Misato turned and headed for the living room without another word. Shinji had to suppress his racing heart as he followed her through the hallway. Everything was gray, sunrise still a bit away.  
美里小姐一言不发地转身走向客厅。真嗣跟在她身后穿过走廊，努力压抑着狂跳的心。四周一片灰暗，日出尚早。

Shinji and Asuka hadn't done anything wild yet, but they were the only ones who knew that. What Ms. Misato, who just found them in bed together, might think was a totally different story. Not to mention what kind of report the rescue team would have made yesterday after finding them by the lake, naked and cuddling together.  
真嗣和明日香尚未做出什么出格之事，但这只有他们自己知道。至于美里小姐，刚刚发现他们同床共枕时会怎么想，那完全是另一回事。更不用说昨天救援队在湖边发现他们赤身裸体、相拥而眠后会做出什么样的报告了。

_First school and now this. Would've been better if I had at least done the deed. Then my reputation would be deserved.  
先是学校，现在又是这样。如果我至少完成了那件事，或许我的名声还算实至名归。_

Shinji almost smiled at the thought, but at that moment Ms. Misato, arriving right in the middle of the living room, turned toward him. The half-formed smile was immediately wiped away from his lips. It was Ms. Misato, looking into Shinji's eyes, who smiled.  
真嗣几乎要笑出来，但就在这时，美里小姐正好走进客厅，转向他。那半成形的笑容立刻从他唇边消失了。是美里小姐，凝视着真嗣的眼睛，她笑了。

"Morning, Shinji. How are you feeling? Are you okay?"  
“早上好，真嗣。你感觉怎么样？还好吗？”

"I'm fine. I can't move too much too quickly, though. Have to be careful. I'm on pain pills, too."  
"我没事。不过不能动得太快太多，得小心点。我还在吃止痛药。"

"How about school? Think you could do it?" Misato asked, then lifted her hand to check her wristwatch. "Or you want me to call the school later?"  
"那学校呢？你觉得能去吗？" 美里问道，然后抬起手看了看手表。"还是你想让我晚点再给学校打电话？"

Shinji kept his silence for a moment, just blinking. Skipping school and staying home. It was something he hadn't really thought about but that suddenly sounded pretty appealing. He had quite a legitimate excuse, too. But it would mean being away from Asuka, and Shinji was not willing to do that so soon after reconciling with her. Even if it was only for a few hours in the morning.  
真嗣沉默了一会儿，只是眨了眨眼。逃学待在家里。这是他之前没怎么考虑过的事，但突然间听起来颇具吸引力。他也有相当正当的理由。但这意味着要离开明日香，而真嗣并不愿意在和好之后这么快就与她分开。即使只是早上几个小时。

"I have a lot of subjects I haven't caught up on yet since the suspension. I think I should attend school if possible."  
“因为停课，我还有很多科目没补上。我觉得如果可能的话，应该去上学。”

It was not a real reason, but it wasn't a lie, either, so it came out confident and calm, things usually absent when he lied. Even before the suspension, Shinji was far from an exemplary student. Now his report card was basically a pending disaster.  
这并非真正的理由，但也并非谎言，因此他说得自信而平静，这些通常在他撒谎时是缺席的。即使在停课之前，真嗣也远非模范学生。现在他的成绩单基本上是一场即将到来的灾难。

Misato gave a small nod, probably having no objections. Silence descended on the damp gray kitchen. Shinji wondered if that was all she really wanted to say right now, or if it was just a prelude to more uncomfortable topics. As far as Shinji was concerned, finding two kids in the same bed was definitely something that warranted a long, hard talk.  
美里微微点头，大概没有异议。潮湿灰暗的厨房里陷入了沉默。真嗣不知道这是她现在真正想说的全部，还是只是更多令人不适话题的前奏。就真嗣而言，发现两个孩子在同一张床上，绝对是一件需要长时间严肃谈话的事情。

Or maybe she didn't know how to deal with this situation either. Her next words seem to confirm Shinji's suspicion.  
或许她也不知道该如何应对这种情况。她接下来的话似乎证实了真嗣的猜疑。

"Come to think of it, it feels like that's all we talk about these days, huh. 'Are you hurt,' 'how are you feeling' and all that. I'm sorry every time."  
“仔细想想，最近我们好像总是在谈论这些，是吧。‘你受伤了吗’，‘你感觉怎么样’之类的。每次都道歉。”

_Not really_, Shinji thought. He heard about her father not too long ago, after all. But too many things had happened in the interval between then and now to give him a chance to reflect on the topic. He still wasn't sure how he should feel about it.  
真嗣心想，其实也不尽然。毕竟不久前他才得知她父亲的事。但在这期间发生了太多事情，让他无暇深思这个话题。他仍然不确定自己对此应该有何感受。

But it was also true that he had been getting injured a lot lately. It hadn't been this bad when he first started piloting Eva. So Shinji gave a small nod and smiled.  
但最近他确实受伤频繁，这在刚开始驾驶 EVA 时还没这么严重。于是，真嗣轻轻点头，微笑了一下。

"Yeah, I guess." “嗯，我想也是。”

Then Shinji wondered if he said something odd. Ms. Misato had ended her words with an apology, and it was probably strange to respond to that with agreement. For a moment he considered adding something like 'you don't have anything to be sorry about'. But Misato's next question caught him off-guard.  
随后，真嗣疑惑自己是否说了什么奇怪的话。美里小姐以道歉结束对话，用同意来回应可能显得不妥。他本想补充一句“你没什么需要道歉的”，但美里的下一个问题让他措手不及。

"What happened with Asuka? Can you tell me?"  
"明日香怎么了？你能告诉我吗？"

It required a great amount of willpower not to blush or stutter. Shinji forced himself to swallow through a sudden lump in his throat.  
不脸红也不结巴需要极大的意志力。真嗣强迫自己咽下喉咙里突然出现的硬块。

"Nothing! We didn't do anything! We just slept together, that's all! She just barged into my room when I was trying to sleep, and just..."  
"没什么！我们什么都没做！只是睡在一起，仅此而已！她在我试图睡觉的时候闯进我的房间，然后就……"

Ms. Misato was silent, just looking at Shinji with a guarded face. "You can wake her up and ask her," Shinji added, squirming a little under the weight of her gaze.  
美里小姐沉默不语，只是带着戒备的神情看着真嗣。“你可以叫醒她问问看，”真嗣补充道，在她的注视下略显局促。

He realized that was an odd thing to say, too. Maybe he was still groggy from the sleep and the painkillers, or something. If Ms. Misato did not believe him, why would she believe Asuka? But then again, Asuka, out of pride, wasn't going to lie about an issue like this, and both he and Misato knew it.  
他意识到这话也挺奇怪的。也许他还在睡意和止痛药的作用下有些迷糊，或者别的什么原因。如果美里小姐不相信他，又怎么会相信明日香呢？但话说回来，明日香出于自尊，是不会在这种事情上撒谎的，他和美里都心知肚明。

Instead of doing as he said, Ms. Misato stood still and kept looking at Shinji. As Shinji's face began to heat up, the corners of her mouth turned up in a wry smile.  
美里小姐没有照他说的做，而是站在原地继续盯着真嗣。随着真嗣的脸颊开始发热，她嘴角微微上扬，露出一丝苦笑。

"Of course you didn't. You're still kids. I wasn't asking about that."  
“当然没有，你们还是孩子。我并不是问这个。”

For a moment, Shinji felt a pang of guilt. This felt like deceiving her, although technically it wasn't.  
有那么一刻，真嗣感到一阵内疚。这感觉像是在欺骗她，尽管严格来说并非如此。

And then he was forced to swallow the question that had risen to the top of his throat: _then what were you asking about?_  
然后他不得不咽下已经涌到喉咙口的问题：那你到底在问什么？

Wildly fluctuating synchronization rates. The cold war that had been raging between the two of them for most of the last week. Yesterday. Misato had been pretty busy recently, but there was no way she hadn't noticed something was amiss. That was probably why she kept taking Asuka to HQ these past few days, wasn't it? But Shinji knew what she was asking for, and he didn't want to answer. He didn't even know how he would answer. He didn't understand half of what was going on between him and Asuka, and what he _did_ understand were things he didn't dare tell Misato.  
同步率剧烈波动。过去一周大部分时间里，两人之间持续的冷战。昨天。美里最近一直很忙，但她不可能没察觉到有什么不对劲。这大概就是为什么她最近几天一直带明日香去总部的原因吧？但真嗣知道她在问什么，而他不想回答。他甚至不知道该如何回答。他和明日香之间发生的事情，他有一半都不明白，而那些他明白的部分，是他不敢告诉美里的。

"Nothing. Everything's fine now."  
“没什么。现在一切都好了。”

Ms. Misato's eyes narrowed ever so subtly. It was a small change, almost imperceptible if you weren't nervously looking out for it. Shinji was very, very worried about what she might be thinking right now. Because he knew he was an obvious liar.  
美里小姐的眼神微微眯起。这个变化很小，如果你不是紧张地留意着，几乎察觉不到。真嗣非常、非常担心她现在可能在想什么。因为他知道自己明显在撒谎。

Misato crossed her arms. 美里交叉双臂。

"Nothing. Is that why you two haven't even looked each other in the eye for days?"  
“没什么。这就是为什么你们俩这几天连看都没看对方一眼吗？”

Shinji felt heat rise in his throat. Being questioned by Misato about what happened with Asuka was a new situation, but what he was feeling was strangely familiar. And for some reason, it was making him angry. Shinji turned his head and looked away from Misato.  
真嗣感到喉咙发热。被美里问及与明日香之间发生了什么，这是一种新的情境，但他所感受到的却出奇地熟悉。出于某种原因，这让他感到愤怒。真嗣转过头，避开了美里的目光。

"We fought. But it's alright now. We've made up."  
“我们吵了一架。但现在没事了，我们已经和好了。”

They hadn't truly reconciled, to be honest. More like swept the whole thing under the rug.  
说实话，他们并没有真正和解。更像是把整件事都掩盖起来了。

Ms. Misato lowered her gaze slightly. Her hands fiddled with the elbows of her red jacket, and it was then that Shinji realized that she must have just gotten home from work and hadn't even changed yet.  
美里小姐微微垂下目光。她的手摆弄着红色夹克的肘部，这时真嗣才意识到她一定是刚下班回家，连衣服都还没换。

For a moment Shinji felt sorry for her, wondering if he should cook her something, an early morning snack or something like that, but it was only for a moment. Because then she lifted her gaze again, and Shinji didn't like the look on her face one bit.  
有那么一刻，真嗣对她感到抱歉，想着是否应该为她做点什么，比如早点弄个早饭之类的，但那只是一瞬间的想法。因为随后她再次抬起目光，而真嗣一点也不喜欢她脸上的表情。

"Look, Shinji, I know it's a weird question but...does she...give you a hard time?"  
“听着，真嗣，我知道这个问题很奇怪，但是……她……是不是让你很为难？”

"What?" “什么？”

Misato was almost fidgeting, and the sight made Shinji uncomfortable. As if the unease was contagious. Shinji couldn't believe what he was seeing, or what he had just heard. He'd expected uncomfortable questions, of course, but this...?  
美里几乎在坐立不安，这一幕让真嗣感到不安。仿佛不安情绪会传染似的。真嗣无法相信他所看到的，或是刚刚听到的。他当然预料到了会有令人不适的问题，但这个...？

"Shinji, don't take this the wrong way. I don't mean to be intrusive, and..."  
“真嗣，别误会。我不是有意冒犯，而且...”

Misato licked her lips once with her tongue. Shinji's throat went dry at the sight.  
美里用舌头舔了一下嘴唇。真嗣看到这一幕，喉咙不禁发干。

"I care about you both so much, and I mean it. You and Asuka. You've probably heard this from Asuka by now, but I spent some time as her handler before you came along, so I've known her for quite a while, but even so - no, rather, because of that, I..."  
"我非常关心你们两个，真的。你和明日香。你可能已经从明日香那里听说了，但我在你来之前曾担任过她的指挥官，所以我和她认识很久了，即便如此——不，正因为如此，我……"

The silence between her words weighed heavily on Shinji. He had a hunch that whatever Misato was about to say was going to be extremely uncomfortable. Maybe it was better for him to interrupt her, or to run away back to his room. But Shinji didn't dare do that to an adult, to someone who was both his guardian and boss, so there was nothing he could do but stay frozen in place until she spoke again.  
她话语间的沉默让真嗣感到沉重。他有种预感，米萨托即将说出口的话会让他非常不舒服。也许打断她，或者跑回自己的房间会更好。但真嗣不敢对一个既是他的监护人又是上司的成年人这么做，所以他只能僵在原地，直到她再次开口。

"I know how…difficult Asuka can be. And it was okay with me because I'm an adult and it was, well, my job to handle her after all. But you..."  
"我知道明日香有多……难相处。对我来说这没什么，毕竟我是成年人，而且，呃，处理她本来就是我的工作。但对你……"

At that point, she paused again. Misato studied Shinji's face, as if waiting for some sort of response. A nod. An awkward smile. Anything that might be interpreted as positive.  
就在那时，她再次停顿。美里仔细观察着真嗣的脸，仿佛在等待某种回应。一个点头。一个尴尬的微笑。任何可能被解读为积极的反应。

Shinji merely opened and closed his uncooperative mouth a few times. Misato let out a small sigh and resumed speaking.  
真嗣只是几次张合着他那不听使唤的嘴。美里轻轻叹了口气，继续说道。

"So, if she gets too overbearing, then..."  
“所以，如果她变得过于强势，那么……”

"No, Ms. Misato." “不，美里小姐。”

Shinji found himself cutting her off, surprising them both. A stuffy silence descended.  
真嗣发现自己打断了她的话，两人都感到意外。一阵沉闷的沉默笼罩下来。

Shinji realized with a sinking feeling in his stomach what Misato's words meant. He had reacted so reflexively to them, too.  
真嗣心中一沉，意识到美里的话意味着什么。他对这些话的反应也太过本能了。

She wasn't even wrong, to be fair. There really were times when Asuka was overbearing. Or acting unreasonably. He was fresh out of such an incident, after all. But for some reason, Shinji found it hard to agree with Misato.  
平心而论，她并没有错。确实有些时候，明日香会显得过于霸道，或是行为无理。毕竟，他刚刚才经历了这样的一件事。但不知为何，真嗣发现自己很难赞同美里的话。

It was true that Asuka was causing him pain, but she was also giving him a happiness he'd never imagined was possible for him. He would need to tell Misato all of that if he were to agree with her words, and for some reason, he didn't feel like it. Maybe because he wasn't confident in his eloquence, thinking he would just make both him and Asuka sound pathetic. Or maybe he hated the possibility that it might sound like a lame excuse.  
诚然，明日香给他带来了痛苦，但她同时也赋予了他未曾想象过的幸福。如果要同意美里的话，他需要把这些都告诉她，但不知为何，他并不想这么做。或许是因为他对自己的口才没有信心，担心会让两人听起来都很可怜。又或许，他讨厌这听起来像是一个蹩脚的借口。

So Shinji shook his head. The motion was akin to that of shaking something off.  
于是，真嗣摇了摇头。这个动作就像是在甩掉什么东西一样。

"It's alright. I'm fine. Really. You don't have to worry about me. Or Asuka. About either of us."  
"没事的。我很好。真的。你不必担心我。或是明日香。我们俩都不用担心。"

"Shinji, it's okay. You can talk to me. Maybe it's not the right thing to say, but...you know I'm on your side, right?"  
"真嗣，没关系的。你可以跟我谈谈。也许这话不太恰当，但是...你知道我站在你这边，对吧？"

Misato slightly tilted her head, smiling awkwardly. It was the smile of a conspirator. A conspiracy that Shinji wanted no part in. Shinji's face hardened.  
美里微微侧头，尴尬地笑了笑。那是共谋者的笑容。一个真嗣不想参与的阴谋。真嗣的脸色变得严肃起来。

"I don't know what you're talking about, Ms. Misato. I'm on Asuka's side."  
"我不知道你在说什么，美里小姐。我是站在明日香这边的。"

Shinji couldn't bear to look at Misato, so he averted his gaze. Even then he could clearly see her blinking, not knowing what to do. She even stuttered in the next moment.  
真嗣不忍直视美里，于是移开了目光。即便如此，他仍能清楚地看到她眨眼，不知所措。下一刻，她甚至结巴了起来。

"Oh, yeah. Right. Me too. I'm on her side, too. I think I worded it poorly."  
"哦，对。没错。我也是。我也站在她这边。我想我表达得不太好。"

_Then how would you rephrase that?_ Shinji almost wanted to ask, but held back. She was visibly flustered, and he felt guilty for making someone who just offered help to him feel like that. He just wanted to end this conversation right then and there, to go back to his bed where Asuka was sleeping and get another hour or two of sleep before school. But Ms. Misato continued.  
那你会怎么改述呢？真嗣几乎想问出口，但还是忍住了。她明显慌乱了，他为自己让一个刚刚伸出援手的人感到如此不安而内疚。他只想立刻结束这段对话，回到床上，在上学前再睡上一两个小时，而明日香还在那里熟睡。但美里小姐继续说道。

"What I meant to say was..."  
“我想说的是……”

"I don't want to talk about this anymore, Ms. Misato. I want to stop. Please."  
“我不想再谈这件事了，美里小姐。我想停止。请。”

Looking up, Shinji saw Misato's eyes widening, and he realized that he had been a little harsh in his wording. Maybe it was hard for him to keep his composure when it came to Asuka. Maybe he was angry with Misato. Maybe, like the coward he was, Shinji considered Misato to be someone he could be rude to, since she had already proven herself to be kind and supportive of him. He didn't know. He started to feel bad for treating her this way. She was just trying to help him, to support him, even if she might have gone about it the wrong way.  
抬头望去，真嗣看到美里眼睛睁大，意识到自己的措辞有些严厉。或许在涉及到明日香时，他很难保持冷静。或许他对美里感到愤怒。或许，像他这个懦夫一样，真嗣认为可以对美里无礼，因为她已经证明了自己对他的善意和支持。他不知道。他开始为自己这样对待她感到内疚。她只是想帮助他，支持他，即使她的方式可能不对。

But something simmering in Shinji's chest stifled his urge to apologize to Misato. With a complicated feeling in his heart, a feeling that he couldn't really explain or understand, Shinji shook his head again. The voice that came out the next moment was not as strong as before.  
但胸中某种情绪抑制了真嗣向美里道歉的冲动。怀着一种复杂的心情，一种他无法真正解释或理解的感觉，真嗣再次摇了摇头。下一刻发出的声音没有之前那么坚定。

"I... I'm very tired. I took the painkiller Ms. Ritsuko gave me last night. I think I'm still all drowsy because of that. Not like it's been that long."  
“我……我很累。昨晚我吃了律子小姐给的止痛药。我想我还因为那个昏昏沉沉的。没过多久。”

Misato nodded stiffly. "Yes, you must be tired. Oh my, look at me. Waking up a sick kid at this time of the morning and preaching and all. I'm sorry."  
美里僵硬地点了点头。“是的，你一定很累。哎呀，看看我。一大早就把生病的孩子们叫醒，还唠叨个不停。对不起。”

Shinji smiled helplessly, nodding. Misato took a step forward and reached her hand out toward Shinji's face, hesitated for a moment, and then placed her palm on his forehead, as if she was checking for a fever. Shinji shivered slightly. Her hand was very cold. It wasn't like he was sick or anything, but Misato didn't move. Shinji remained still, unable to look at her face. After a moment, her hand slipped away.  
真嗣无奈地笑了笑，点点头。美里向前迈了一步，伸手向真嗣的脸，犹豫了一下，然后将手掌贴在他的额头上，仿佛在检查是否发烧。真嗣微微颤抖了一下。她的手非常冷。他并没有生病，但美里没有移开手。真嗣保持静止，不敢看她的脸。过了一会儿，她的手才滑落。

"Are you sure about school?"  
“你确定要去学校吗？”

Shinji nodded. "Yeah, I'm sure. Are you off work now? Do you want me to make something for breakfast?"  
真嗣点点头。“嗯，我确定。你现在下班了吗？要不要我做点早餐？”

"No, the work isn't officially done yet. I just came here in the middle of a break. To check on you kids. I'll have to go back now. I think I'll be back before dinner, though."  
“不，工作还没正式结束。我只是趁着休息时间过来看看你们。现在得回去了。不过我想晚饭前应该能回来。”

With that, Ms. Misato straightened the collar of her jacket, as if to leave right then and there. It was a slow and deliberate motion, as if she was waiting for Shinji's reaction, so Shinji nodded. She answered with a small smile.  
说完，美里小姐整理了一下夹克的领子，似乎准备立刻离开。这个动作缓慢而刻意，仿佛在等待真嗣的反应，于是真嗣点点头。她回以一个浅浅的微笑。

"See you, then." "那再见啦。"

"Take care, Ms. Misato." "保重，美里小姐。"

Shinji followed her through the kitchen to see her off. As Shinji stood one step out into the hall, waving to her, Misato waved back from the doorway, and left.  
真嗣跟着她穿过厨房，送她离开。当真嗣站在门外一步的地方向她挥手时，美里在门口回挥手，然后离开了。

As soon as he returned to the kitchen, Penpen's refrigerator door swung open with a woosh. Penpen poked his head out of the fridge, his eyes barely opened as if he'd just woken up. The penguin sent Shinji a questioning look.  
他一回到厨房，Penpen 的冰箱门便呼地一声打开了。Penpen 从冰箱里探出头来，眼睛几乎还没睁开，仿佛刚从梦中醒来。这只企鹅向真嗣投去了一个询问的目光。

"It's too late. She's gone now. Go back to sleep."  
“太晚了。她已经走了。回去睡觉吧。”

The penguin's beak opened slightly, then closed, and its entire head went back into the refrigerator.  
企鹅的喙微微张开，随即又合上，整个脑袋缩回了冰箱里。

Shinji turned his head and checked the clock. It was four forty. It occurred to him that he might as well apply that advice to himself, so he trudged weakly toward his room. The nagging sensation that he had wronged Misato somehow weighed heavily on both his mind and body. Maybe he should've at least made her a cup of coffee before sending her off.  
真嗣转过头看了看时钟。已经是四点四十分了。他突然想到，自己或许也可以采纳那条建议，于是他虚弱地拖着步子走向自己的房间。那种觉得自己对美里有所亏欠的感觉，沉重地压在他的心上和身体上。也许他至少应该在她离开前为她泡一杯咖啡。

But the guilt was short-lived, as the sight of Asuka asleep in his bed, half-buried in the futon just as he'd left her, washed all of the bad feelings out of his head. What filled him instead was the same thing that was filling the room now: a warmth laden with Asuka's scent.  
但这种愧疚感转瞬即逝，因为看到明日香在他床上熟睡的样子，半埋在被褥中，就像他离开时那样，所有不好的情绪都从他脑海中消失了。取而代之的是充盈整个房间的温暖，以及明日香特有的气息。

The sight before him, this whole situation, was magical to him. Asuka was sleeping in his bed, looking for all the world like she belonged there. Smiling, Shinji carefully slipped under the covers.  
眼前的景象，整个情况，对他来说如同魔法一般。明日香在他的床上熟睡，看起来就像她本就属于那里。真嗣微笑着，小心翼翼地钻进了被窝。

He was about to decide if he should hug her or not, because he didn't want to wake her, when Asuka's eyes fluttered open, startling him.  
他正犹豫是否该抱抱她，又怕吵醒她，这时明日香的眼睛微微颤动，睁开了，吓了他一跳。

"Where have you been?" “你去哪儿了？”

Her voice was hoarse and soft as butterfly wings in the early-morning quiet. It was the first time Shinji had heard that particular voice from her, and the way it was not beautiful was the most beautiful thing in the world to him.  
她的声音沙哑而轻柔，如同清晨宁静中的蝴蝶翅膀。这是真嗣第一次听到她这样的声音，那种不完美，对他来说却是世界上最美的东西。

And then, in the very next moment, Shinji almost lied to Asuka. Almost casually. That he'd just gone to the bathroom. That she didn't need to worry about anything. Shaking his head slightly, Shinji opened his mouth.  
紧接着，下一刻，真嗣几乎要对明日香撒谎了。几乎是漫不经心地。说他只是去了洗手间。说她不需要担心任何事。他轻轻摇了摇头，张开了嘴。

"Ms. Misato came and went. I guess she just wanted to check on us for a minute before she went back to work."  
“美里小姐来了一下又走了。我想她只是想在我们这里看一眼，然后回去工作。”

Asuka's eyes, dark and dull in the dim light, searched Shinji's face wordlessly. As if to ask if that was all. It occurred to him, then, that maybe Asuka had heard everything. This house was not soundproof, after all. But he didn't want to consider that possibility. He wasn't sure how Asuka would react to Misato's words, and how he should deal with such a delicate situation. Almost reflexively, Shinji started to apologize. Then he remembered that he hadn't actually done anything he needed to apologize for and stopped. Their gazes locked in a warm but heavy silence.  
明日香在昏暗光线下的眼睛，深邃而黯淡，无声地搜索着真嗣的脸庞。仿佛在问，就这样吗？这时，他突然想到，也许明日香听到了一切。毕竟，这房子并不隔音。但他不想考虑这种可能性。他不确定明日香对美里的话会有什么反应，以及他该如何处理这种微妙的局面。几乎是本能地，真嗣开始道歉。随后他记起自己并没有做什么需要道歉的事，便停了下来。他们的目光在温暖而沉重的沉默中交汇。

_I think I hurt Misato. But I couldn't help it. She was trying to drive a wedge, no matter how small, between us, and create distance. To gossip about you and force me to pick a side. So I hurt her. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Would you praise me for it? Would you love me for hurting her for your sake? Would that make you forgive me in the future, if my sync rate ever surpasses yours?  
我觉得我伤害了美里。但我控制不住。她试图在我们之间制造哪怕最微小的隔阂，拉开距离。散布关于你的流言，逼我选择立场。所以我伤害了她。你会为此高兴的，不是吗？你会因此表扬我吗？你会因为我为了你伤害她而爱我吗？如果将来我的同步率超过你，这会让你原谅我吗？_

Shinji shuddered at himself for thinking that way. But he also knew that there was a part of him that was welcoming the idea. He didn't dare give voice to any of his thoughts, though, so he kept his mouth shut and looked at Asuka, almost pleadingly. Tears began to form in his eyes.  
真嗣为自己有这样的想法而颤抖。但他也知道，自己内心有一部分是欢迎这个想法的。尽管如此，他不敢说出任何想法，只是闭上嘴，近乎恳求地看着明日香。泪水开始在他的眼眶中打转。

Asuka snorted, then leaned down to bury her head in his arms. At the same time, her hands slowly dug into Shinji's sides. Shinji lifted himself up a little, mindful of his injured ribs, so her hand could pass between his body and the bed, and returned her embrace. He could feel the warmth and curves of her body through the thin fabric of her t-shirt. Asuka could definitely feel his reaction to that, but neither of them said anything.  
明日香哼了一声，然后俯身将头埋在他的臂弯里。与此同时，她的手慢慢探入真嗣的两侧。真嗣微微起身，小心避开受伤的肋骨，让她的手能穿过他的身体和床之间，回抱住她。他能透过她薄薄的 T 恤感受到她身体的温暖和曲线。明日香肯定能感觉到他的反应，但两人都没有说什么。

The heat radiating from Asuka's body was a little overwhelming in the warmth of the summer morning. Her arm, tucked between the mattress and Shinji's body, moved with care and consideration, but it still wasn't completely comfortable. But if that was the price he had to pay for holding her, then he was willing to go through it.  
夏日的早晨，从明日香身上散发的热量有些让人难以招架。她的手臂小心翼翼地夹在床垫和真嗣的身体之间，尽管动作谨慎体贴，却仍未完全舒适。但如果这是拥抱她所必须付出的代价，那么他愿意承受。

Asuka flinched slightly. Puzzled, Shinji lowered his head to glance at her, but the girl in his arms didn't look up, burying her face in his chest stubbornly.  
明日香微微一颤。真嗣困惑地低下头瞥了她一眼，但怀中的女孩并未抬头，倔强地将脸埋在他的胸前。

"Hey, does it hurt?" With that, Asuka raised her index finger and lightly touched Shinji's side.  
“嘿，疼吗？”说着，明日香抬起食指，轻轻触碰真嗣的侧身。

"No." That was only half a lie.  
"不。" 这只是一个半真半假的谎言。

"If I ever hurt you, tell me. Don't be an idiot and keep it to yourself."  
"如果我伤害了你，告诉我。别像个傻瓜一样把事情藏在心里。"

"Yeah." "嗯。"

_If only I could do that,_ Shinji mused as he buried his nose in Asuka's hair. That was the thought that kept him awake as Asuka fell back to sleep in his arms, as his shirt grew cold with Asuka's drool, as the morning light peeked through the crack in the door, and as his alarm clock finally went off.  
真嗣一边把鼻子埋进明日香的发丝里，一边暗自思忖，要是能做到这一点就好了。这个念头让他彻夜难眠，明日香在他怀里再次入睡，他的衬衫被明日香的口水弄得冰凉，晨光透过门缝悄悄溜进来，直到他的闹钟终于响起。

---

Today was the first proper day of school the two of them were to attend since Asuka had announced their relationship. The first day where they could act like a proper couple. The first chance for them to hang out together, openly, at school. Asuka had spent the whole morning trying to figure out how to act today. She was aware that she walked a fine line here: between what she wanted to do and what Shinji would bear with. She didn't like this feeling of pressure and self-censorship, even if it was because of Shinji, but honestly, she was willing to do many things if it meant avoiding a repeat of their recent troubles.  
今天是两人自宣布恋情后正式上学的第一天。是他们可以像一对正常情侣那样行动的第一天。也是他们第一次有机会在学校里公开地一起闲逛。明日香整个早上都在琢磨今天该怎么表现。她清楚自己在这里走的是一条细线：介于她想做的事情和真嗣能忍受的事情之间。她不喜欢这种压力和自我审查的感觉，即使是因为真嗣，但老实说，如果这意味着避免重蹈最近的麻烦，她愿意做很多事情。

But what was the limit of his tolerance? Some things were irreversible, she figured, but what could and couldn't she do?  
但他的忍耐极限在哪里？有些事情是不可逆转的，她想，但她能做和不能做的又是什么呢？

The conversation between them during breakfast was unnaturally dry and superficial. Now that the intensity of last night had subsided and they woke up in the same bed, a kind of awkwardness seemed to have developed between them. Even though they hadn't done anything of substance.  
他们早餐时的对话异常干涩和表面。昨晚的激情已经消退，醒来时他们躺在同一张床上，一种尴尬似乎在他们之间悄然滋生。尽管他们并没有实质性的行为。

To Asuka's surprise, it was Shinji who solved her worries. Upon arriving at the school gate, he grabbed her hand without giving her a chance to react. The only thing she could do was make a surprised 'ah!' sound before getting pulled along by Shinji.  
令明日香惊讶的是，解决她烦恼的竟是真嗣。一到校门口，他便不由分说地抓住她的手，让她连反应的时间都没有，只能发出一声惊讶的‘啊！’，随即被真嗣拉着走。

Shinji didn't even look back in her direction, just kept walking forward. All Asuka could see as she hurriedly followed was his reddened earlobe. And all the heads turning their way, of course.  
真嗣没有回头看她，只是一直向前走。明日香匆忙跟上时，只能看到他泛红的耳垂，当然还有那些转向他们的目光。

Then Asuka came up beside Shinji, grinning. Their shoulders and elbows tangled and bumped against each other. When they passed through the classroom door, still walking side by side and barely passing through the narrow door because of that, she heard all the girls gasp. Asuka basked in the blatant stares and halfheartedly-muffled whispers until she sat down. Hikari, who was standing near the teacher's table and chatting with a few girls, made eye contact with Asuka. Her eyes widened slightly at the sight of them, then she nodded and smiled. Asuka didn't respond.  
接着明日香走到真嗣身边，咧嘴一笑。他们的肩膀和肘部不时相碰。当他们并肩穿过教室门时，由于太过靠近，几乎卡在了狭窄的门框里，她听到所有女生倒吸一口气的声音。明日香享受着那些直白的目光和半遮半掩的窃窃私语，直到坐下。站在讲台旁与几个女生聊天的光，看到他们后，眼睛微微睁大，然后点头微笑。明日香没有回应。

That wasn't the end of it. Shinji came to Asuka's seat at every recess. The girls who normally flocked to Asuka did not dare to approach her today, scared off by Asuka's warning looks. Ignoring their sneaking glances and whispers, Shinji and Asuka made small talk until the bell rang and the class started again.  
事情并未就此结束。每逢课间休息，真嗣都会来到明日香的座位旁。平日里围绕在明日香身边的女生们今天都不敢靠近，被明日香警告的眼神吓退。无视她们偷偷的目光和窃窃私语，真嗣和明日香闲聊着，直到铃声响起，再次开始上课。

It was clear to Asuka that Shinji was trying very, very hard. Even so, their conversation was punctuated by awkward silences, and his eyes would flick uneasily about the room, never lingering for too long on any given knot of people. It was apparent that being the center of his peers' attention was no easy feat for him. He was much more natural at home. But the awkwardness was easily manageable with Asuka's help. She commanded attention at the right moments, changed topics when needed, and sent stern warning glares when the girls' gawking became too blatant. She even drove the girl in front of her off at recesses so Shinji could have a place to sit whenever he came along.  
对明日香来说，真嗣显然在非常努力地尝试。即便如此，他们的对话中仍不时出现尴尬的沉默，他的目光不安地在教室里游移，从不长时间停留在任何一群人身上。显然，成为同龄人关注的焦点对他来说并不轻松。他在家里自然得多。但在明日香的帮助下，这种尴尬很容易被化解。她恰到好处地吸引注意力，适时转换话题，并在女生们过分直白的注视时投以严厉的警告眼神。她甚至在课间休息时把座位前的女生赶走，以便真嗣来时有个地方坐。

By the time the last class of the day arrived, Asuka felt something akin to a shame. If only school on Saturdays lasted long enough for a lunch break. She wanted to do something more with Shinji. Something involving food, maybe. Like climbing onto his lap and feeding him herself. It was something they could do at home (she was honestly not sure why she hadn't thought of it before), but it would be infinitely better with an audience. She wondered what kind of face Hikari would make if she saw such a thing.  
当最后一节课到来时，明日香感到一种近似羞愧的情绪。如果周六的学校能持续到午餐时间该多好。她想和真嗣做些更有趣的事，或许涉及食物。比如爬到他腿上亲自喂他。这是他们在家可以做的事（她真不明白自己之前怎么没想到），但有观众在场会好得多。她好奇如果光看到这一幕会是什么表情。

Of course, that didn't mean Asuka had given up on the chance to make the most of her last moments at school today. She always had a plan for different scenarios, after all.  
当然，这并不意味着明日香放弃了充分利用今天在校最后时光的机会。毕竟，她总是为不同情况制定计划。

On weekdays, only the designated group remained behind after school to clean up, but on Saturdays, the entire class did the clean up before the end of the school. Why they didn't just hire a professional janitor was beyond Asuka's comprehension, but apparently students doing the cleaning was the rule in Japanese schools. So, with the last class finished, Asuka was supposed to check which group she was assigned to and where she had to clean, but she walked toward Shinji's seat instead.  
平日里，只有指定的团队放学后留下来打扫，但周六全班都要在放学前完成清洁。明日香无法理解为什么他们不直接雇个专业清洁工，但显然学生打扫是日本学校的规矩。因此，最后一节课结束后，明日香本应查看自己被分配到哪个小组以及需要打扫的地方，但她却走向了真嗣的座位。

Shinji was sitting in his seat, his chin resting on his hand. His gaze was somewhere far away, seemingly oblivious to all the commotion around him. Asuka's heart sank for a moment, and she looked in the direction of his gaze. It wasn't until she realized that there was no sign of the First anywhere in the vicinity - no, come to think of it, she hadn't been at school at all today - that she relaxed. Then she felt a bit silly. She was still suspicious of Shinji. Even after everything.  
真嗣坐在座位上，下巴支在手上。他的目光飘向远方，似乎对周围的喧嚣浑然不觉。明日香的心沉了一下，她顺着他的目光看去。直到她意识到附近并没有一丁点一式的踪影——不，仔细想想，她今天根本就没来学校——她才放松下来。随即她感到有些傻气。她对真嗣的怀疑依旧未减。即便经历了那么多。

Only after realizing that there was nothing amiss, Asuka fully took in Shinji's face, something she rarely did. And how much she liked it. Contemplative. Delicate. Soft. Warm. Loyal. Asuka's.  
只有在确认一切无恙后，明日香才完全看清了真嗣的脸，这种机会她很少有。而她又是多么喜欢这张脸。沉思的。精致的。柔和的。温暖的。忠诚的。属于明日香的。

_I wonder what he's thinking right now. Is he thinking about me? He better be. His head should be full of me and me only.  
不知道他现在在想什么。他会不会在想我？他最好是在想我。他的脑海里应该只有我和我一个人。_

Asuka strode briskly toward his seat, smiling. Shinji, now aware of Asuka's presence, raised an eyebrow and gave her a questioning glance as she stood right next to his desk.  
明日香快步走向自己的座位，面带微笑。真嗣此时已察觉到明日香的存在，扬起眉毛，当她站在他的课桌旁时，投去一个询问的目光。

"Asuka? Are you here to clean up this line? Do you want me to move?"  
“明日香？你是来清理这条线的吗？需要我挪开吗？”

Instead of answering, Asuka kicked off her uwabakis and climbed lightly onto Shinji's desk. Shinji leaned back in his chair, eyes widening. As if in pursuit, Asuka pivoted, using her hips as the axis. She sat facing Shinji and placed her feet on his thighs. Shinji didn't protest. He didn't say anything at all, but Asuka noted with satisfaction the way his lower belly retracted and his crotch rose. She bent over, putting her elbows on her knees and resting her chin on her hand in imitation of the pose Shinji had been affecting moments earlier. She smirked a little as she watched color flood Shinji's cheeks, barely an arm's length away.  
明日香没有回答，而是踢掉了她的室内鞋，轻盈地爬上了真嗣的课桌。真嗣靠在椅背上，眼睛睁大。仿佛在追逐，明日香以臀部为轴心转身，面对着真嗣坐下，将双脚放在他的大腿上。真嗣没有抗议，他什么也没说，但明日香满意地注意到他的下腹部收缩，胯部微微抬起。她弯下腰，将肘部放在膝盖上，下巴支在手上，模仿着真嗣刚才的姿势。她微微一笑，看着真嗣的脸颊染上红晕，两人相距不过一臂之遥。

Ignoring the stares that were already beginning to pour in, Asuka tilted her head at Shinji. "What are you thinking about?"  
无视那些已经开始投来的目光，明日香歪着头看向真嗣。“你在想什么呢？”

Shinji's flush deepened, but he didn't look away from her. Asuka quite liked that development.  
真嗣的脸更红了，但他并没有移开视线。明日香对此颇为喜欢。

"Nothing. I just, this and that, nothing in particular."  
“没什么。就是，这个那个，没什么特别的。”

_This and that?_ Normally Asuka did not like that kind of lame answer, but she took it nonetheless. She was in a good mood today.  
这个和那个？通常情况下，明日香不喜欢这种含糊其辞的回答，但她今天还是接受了。她今天心情不错。

"So what's the plan for lunch?"  
“那午餐有什么计划吗？”

"Uh...nothing concrete yet?"  
“呃……还没具体打算呢？”

"Then let's eat out on the way home!"  
"那我们回家路上去外面吃吧！"

Shinji flinched and then slowly shook his head. Asuka frowned. "Why, do you have a different idea?"  
真嗣缩了缩身子，然后缓缓摇头。明日香皱眉道：“为什么，你有别的想法吗？”

"No, not really, but why spend money when we could just eat at home..."  
"不，倒也不是，但为什么非要花钱在外面吃呢，我们在家吃不也一样..."

"Oh, come on, you sound like someone out of the Second Impact Generation, what the hell is that? Are you Misato or something?"  
"哦，拜托，你听起来像是第二次冲击世代的人，那是什么鬼？你是美里吗？"

Shinji chuckled, scratching the back of his head. "Let's do as you say, then. Consider it a date, I guess..."  
真嗣轻笑一声，挠了挠后脑勺。"那就按你说的做吧。就当是约会吧，大概..."

Asuka tried to smile at that, but didn't quite manage, because Shinji's face hardened at that moment. She was about to ask what was wrong when she realized he was looking at her knees.  
明日香试图对此微笑，但没能完全做到，因为此时真嗣的脸色变得严肃起来。她正要问怎么了，却发现他在盯着她的膝盖看。

_Took you long enough to notice._ "Oh, this -"  
你注意到这花了这么长时间。“哦，这个——”

"Asuka! Only Ikari is exempt from cleaning duty, not you! Now..."  
“明日香！只有碇可以免除清洁任务，不是你！现在……”

Shinji and Asuka's heads snapped around at the sound of Hikari's voice. Hikari, broom in hand, was staring at where Shinji had been staring just a moment ago. Asuka's knees.  
听到光的声音，真嗣和明日香的头猛地转了过去。光手里拿着扫帚，正盯着真嗣刚才盯着的地方。明日香的膝盖。

"Uh, Asuka, are you hurt too? Is that why you're resting?"  
"呃，明日香，你也受伤了吗？所以才在休息吗？"

"Ehm, no, not really, but..."  
"嗯，不，其实没有，但是..."

Asuka considered saying yes, but she didn't. She didn't want to sound whiny over a few simple scratches. And she didn't want to make up some lame excuses to get out of cleaning duty. If she didn't want to, she wouldn't, end of story.  
明日香考虑过说是，但她没有。她不想因为几处简单的擦伤就抱怨个不停。而且她也不想编造一些蹩脚的借口来逃避清洁工作。如果她不想做，她就不会做，故事到此结束。

But for some reason she found herself lifting one foot slightly, pulling the sock on that side down to her ankle. A girl, somewhere in the distance, made a sharp sucking sound through her teeth.  
但不知为何，她发现自己轻轻抬起了一只脚，将那边的袜子拉到了脚踝处。远处某个地方，一个女孩通过牙齿发出了一声尖锐的吸气声。

She always wore knee socks to school, so her legs below the knees and the scratches she got yesterday were almost completely covered by them. Now they were exposed for all to see. Red lines, long and short, thick and thin, sliced through the creamy white skin of her legs. Some parts were already crusted with black and brown scabs around the edges. All of them from yesterday's frantic knee-dragging on the lake shore. Asuka hadn't considered them particularly spectacular, but now that she saw them again in the bright noon light, they really were a bit gaudy.  
她总是穿着及膝袜去学校，所以她膝盖以下的腿部和她昨天得到的抓痕几乎完全被遮住了。现在它们暴露无遗。红色线条，长短不一，粗细各异，划破了她的腿部那奶油般白皙的皮肤。有些部分已经围绕边缘结了黑色和棕色的痂。所有这些都是昨天在湖岸边疯狂拖着膝盖造成的。明日香并没有觉得它们特别引人注目，但现在在正午明亮的阳光下再次看到它们，它们确实有点过于显眼了。

_I hope they don't leave scars.  
希望它们不会留下疤痕。_

"Asuka! What happened yesterday? Ikari said he broke a bone, and now you have cuts like that all over your leg, but apparently there wasn't a battle or anything? At least that's what Ikari said, and there really wasn't an evacuation alert or anything like that, but..."  
“明日香！昨天发生了什么？碇说他骨折了，现在你腿上又满是那样的伤口，但显然并没有战斗或者什么吧？至少碇是这么说的，而且确实没有疏散警报之类的东西，但是……”

"Oh, that." Asuka thought for a moment. All she knew was that an Angel had tried to infiltrate the database at headquarters yesterday and had subsequently been repelled. At last night's debriefing, Misato had instructed them to keep it a secret. Asuka didn't understand the reason behind it, and Nerv didn't trouble themselves to explain.  
“哦，那个啊。”明日香想了一会儿。她只知道昨天有一个使徒试图侵入总部数据库，随后被击退了。在昨晚的简报会上，美里指示他们保密。明日香不明白其中的原因，NERV 也没有费心解释。

Guess she would have to make something up, then. She didn't have to try too hard. All she needed to do was omit some details, after all.  
看来她得编点什么了。不过她不必太费力。毕竟，只需要省略一些细节就行了。

"It's got nothing to do with an Angel. We just went to the lake yesterday night, just the two of us, after the test at headquarters, and the ground there was a bit uneven and harder than I thought, I guess? I didn't even notice it at that moment but when we got home..."  
"这跟天使无关。我们昨晚只是去了湖边，就我们俩，在总部测试之后，那里的地面有点不平，比我预想的要硬，我想？我当时都没注意到，但当我们回到家..."

Asuka belatedly realized Hikari's face flushed so brightly that even her freckles glowed red. Only then did she realize that she just completely misled Hikari and everyone who was listening. Sure enough, she could hear the sound of chattering in the distance.  
明日香后知后觉地意识到光的脸红得如此鲜艳，连她的雀斑都泛着红光。直到那时她才意识到自己完全误导了光和所有在听的人。果然，她能听到远处传来的窃窃私语声。

"I guess she really has no shame whatsoever."  
"我想她真是毫无羞耻之心。"

"She's from the West. That's why she's like that."  
"她来自西方。所以她才那样。"

"Did you hear that? She broke his ribs. How is that even possible? How hard did she…"  
"你听说了吗？她打断了他的肋骨。这怎么可能？她到底有多大力气……"

Asuka's stomach clenched. Unlike Monday's incident, this was a genuine gaffe. The idea that she had repeated the same mistake, and that she'd have to go through the same trouble made her feel almost sick. There was a part of her that didn't like the fact she was this conscious of Shinji's reaction, but that part of her didn't even dare raise its voice right now.  
明日香的胃紧缩了一下。与周一的事件不同，这次是个真正的失误。她重复了同样的错误，并且将不得不经历同样的麻烦，这让她几乎感到恶心。她内心有一部分不喜欢自己如此在意真嗣的反应，但那部分现在甚至不敢大声说话。

Asuka squinted at Shinji, but his face betrayed nothing. She wondered if he didn't understand why Asuka's words were a mistake, but that didn't seem likely. So anxious was Asuka to study Shinji's face that she nearly jumped out of her skin when she heard Hikari's voice.  
明日香眯起眼睛盯着真嗣，但他脸上毫无破绽。她想知道他是否不明白明日香的话为何是个错误，但这似乎不太可能。明日香急于观察真嗣的表情，以至于听到光的声音时差点吓得跳起来。

"Is, is that it? Uhm, maybe bring a yoga mat next time…?"  
“就，就这样吗？呃，下次也许带个瑜伽垫来……？”

Before Asuka could ask what the hell that meant, Hikari covered her face with both hands and ran away. Asuka's eyes followed her and found the girls staring in her direction. As soon as they realized Asuka was watching, all of them quickly resumed their cleaning.  
在明日香能问出那是什么意思之前，光双手捂住脸跑开了。明日香的目光追随着她，发现女孩们都朝她的方向看。一意识到明日香在看她们，所有人立刻继续打扫起来。

_At least that got rid of Hikari,_ she thought, trying to ignore the shame still prickling in her chest. Suddenly, a soft hand wrapped around Asuka's calf. Asuka flinched and turned to find Shinji looking up at her, a faint smile on his flushed cheeks.  
至少这摆脱了光，她想，试图忽视胸中仍刺痛的羞愧。突然，一只柔软的手环绕在明日香的小腿上。明日香一惊，转身发现真嗣正抬头看着她，涨红的脸颊上挂着淡淡的微笑。

"It's a deal. I mean, lunch."  
“成交。我是说，午餐。”

Asuka's mouth opened slightly, then closed. The corners of her mouth lifted, forming a smile.  
明日香的嘴微微张开，随即又合上。嘴角上扬，形成了一个微笑。

"Yeah." "嗯。"

---

"How much did you drink last night before the alarm?"  
“昨晚警报响起前你喝了多少？”

Misato flinched, then looked up. Ritsuko hadn't said much for the past few minutes. Maybe she'd finally figured out something to say. Or maybe she was finally done with her work.  
美里一惊，然后抬起头来。律子这几分钟都没怎么说话。也许她终于想到了要说什么，或者她终于完成了工作。

Misato shook her head without lifting it from its position atop her arms, which were folded on Ritsuko's desk.  
美里没有从双臂上抬起头，她的手臂正叠放在律子的桌子上，只是摇了摇头。

"Not much. We've only been drinking for a few minutes when you folks raised the alarm."  
"没什么特别的。我们才喝了没几分钟，你们就拉响了警报。"

"Then why are you so down?"  
"那你为什么这么沮丧？"

"Isn't it natural? It's already noon and I didn't sleep at all last night. All I want to do is go home and crash."  
"这不是很正常吗？已经中午了，我昨晚一夜没睡。我现在只想回家躺平。"

Ritsuko lifted her mug with a huff and took a sip. The smell of strong coffee wafted in. Misato buried her face in her arms, still folded on top of the desk. Ritsuko set the mug down and spoke again.  
律子哼了一声，举起杯子抿了一口。浓郁的咖啡香气飘散开来。美里将脸埋在双臂中，依旧趴在桌子上。律子放下杯子，再次开口。

"Hmm, that reminds me. How's home?"  
嗯，这让我想起来了。家里怎么样？

_Yeah, it's about time you asked.  
是啊，你终于问到这个了。_

Misato didn't say anything for a moment. Honestly, this whole thing was exhausting, tightening her chest. Especially after what had happened earlier today. For some reason, she couldn't stop thinking about Kaji, but thinking of him just reminded her of the past, which tightened the feelings in her chest even more. Misato sighed and deflected.  
美里一时没有说话。老实说，这一切让她感到筋疲力尽，胸口发紧。尤其是今天早些时候发生的事情。不知为何，她无法停止想念加持，但想到他只会让她回忆起过去，这让她胸中的情感更加紧绷。美里叹了口气，转移了话题。

"You look very calm, Rits."  
“你看起来很平静，律子。”

Ritsuko's eyes, nailed to the monitor until now, turned to Misato. "Me? Is there any reason I shouldn't be?"  
律子的目光从一直盯着的显示器上移开，转向美里。“我吗？有什么理由我不该平静吗？”

"You defeated an Angel. Glorious solo kill. If we don't count joint records, you are tied with Asuka and Rei. That's pretty impressive, don't you think? You're not even a pilot, after all."  
"你击败了一只使徒。辉煌的单杀战绩。如果不算联合记录，你和明日香、绫波并列。这相当了不起，你不觉得吗？毕竟你甚至不是一名驾驶员。"

Ritsuko pursed her lips in a show of open contempt. Her gaze turned back to the monitor, too, as if to say Misato wasn't even worthy of her attention anymore. Soon the keyboard began to clack.  
律子双唇紧抿，显露出明显的轻蔑。她的目光也转回了显示器，仿佛在说美里已不值得她再关注。很快，键盘声便响了起来。

"Is that how you'd feel? That it's your kill, or some similar nonsense?"  
"你会这样想吗？认为这是你的击杀，或是类似的胡言乱语？"

Misato shook her head. "No."  
美里摇了摇头。"不。"

"Of course not. We're not Asuka."  
"当然不是。我们不是明日香。"

Misato couldn't suppress a wry smile. "You be careful with that."  
美里忍不住露出一丝苦笑。"你可要小心点。"

Ritsuko's gaze came back to Misato. Her hands were still tapping away at the keyboard. The questioning look in her eyes made Misato sigh. She had tried to avoid this topic, but here she was bringing it back up again.  
律子的目光回到了美里身上。她的双手仍在键盘上敲击着。她眼中那询问的神情让美里叹了口气。她本想避开这个话题，但此刻却又不得不提起。

"I think Shinji hates me for saying something like that earlier today. I didn't mean to badmouth Asuka, but it must have come across that way. Or, I don't know, maybe I _was_ actually badmouthing her a bit. I was just trying to say that I was on his side. I don't know how to deal with this anymore."  
“我想真嗣可能因为我今天早些时候说的话而讨厌我。我并不是想诋毁明日香，但那番话肯定听起来像是那样。或者，我不知道，也许我确实是在诋毁她一点。我只是想表达我站在他那边。我已经不知道该怎么处理这种情况了。”

"Well…" Ritsuko turned her attention back to the monitor. She seemed awfully busy. "I've never raised a child, and since I'm an only child, I've never had to deal with favoritism from parents, either, so I honestly can't offer you any advice on this matter."  
“嗯……”律子又将注意力转回到显示器上。她看起来非常忙碌。“我从未养育过孩子，而且作为独生女，我也从未经历过父母偏心的情况，所以老实说，在这件事上我无法给你任何建议。”

"I wasn't asking for it anyway."  
"反正我也没在问这个。"

With that, their conversation ended and silence descended again. With only the sound of the keyboard filling the room, Misato thought about Ritsuko's words.  
说完这些，他们的对话就此结束，房间再次陷入寂静。只有键盘的敲击声回荡在室内，美里思索着律子的话语。

_Favoritism, huh? 偏爱，是吗？_

She wanted to dismiss it as nonsense, but the words cut deeper than she initially thought.  
她本想一笑置之，但那些话却比她最初以为的要刺得更深。

_I'm not playing favorites. I was just trying to help someone who might be getting the short end of the stick.  
我没有偏心。我只是想帮助那些可能处于不利地位的人。_

Misato snorted. The space between her arm and jacket heated up. The noises of typing stopped. Ritsuko cleared her throat.  
律子哼了一声。她手臂和夹克之间的空间开始发热。打字的声音停了下来。律子清了清嗓子。

"A loyal boyfriend, huh? That means their little fight is over now, too? Not because of your contribution, I guess."  
"忠实的男朋友，是吗？那意味着他们的小争吵也结束了，对吧？我想不是因为你的功劳。"

Misato looked up, furrowing her brow. "How do you know that? Does Section 2 report to you about pilot affairs as well?"  
美里抬头，皱起眉头。“你怎么知道的？第二课也向你报告驾驶员的事务吗？”

"I don't need them to. The report from the recovery team yesterday, their faces while I examined Shinji, their general demeanor when I let them go…Asuka and Shinji might as well be carrying around neon signs that say "we're back in love mode!"  
“我不需要他们报告。昨天回收小组的报告，他们在我检查真嗣时的表情，我放他们走时的整体态度……明日香和真嗣简直就像举着霓虹灯牌，上面写着‘我们又恋爱了！’”

"Well, it was a stupid drama to begin with, and honestly, there's no guarantee it won't happen again. I really don't know what to do."  
"嗯，一开始就是场愚蠢的闹剧，老实说，不能保证它不会再发生。我真的不知道该怎么办。"

"I'm actually more surprised that you were so helpless in this situation than by the drama itself. Where's all your experience with Kaji gone? Don't you have any advice for inexperienced lovers?"  
"我其实更惊讶于你在这种情况下如此无助，而不是闹剧本身。你和加持的所有经验都去哪儿了？难道你没有给缺乏经验的恋人任何建议吗？"

It was probably a joke. The light tone of her voice and the slightly upturned corner of her mouth testified to that. But Misato couldn't really smile at Ritsuko's words. Turning her head toward the window, Misato opened her drying lips. "Well, I don't know. Kaji and I never fought. We squabbled. A lot. But it was never anything serious, you know?"  
这可能是个玩笑。她声音中的轻快语调和微微上扬的嘴角证明了这一点。但美里无法对律子的这些话真正笑出来。她转向窗户，干裂的嘴唇微微张开。“嗯，我不知道。我和加持从未真正争吵过。我们只是小打小闹。很多次。但从来都不是什么严重的事，你知道吗？”

_Everything was perfect, until the fear in my heart grew and exploded.  
一切都是那么完美，直到心中的恐惧逐渐膨胀并爆发。_

Ritsuko looked at Misato. She didn't return it. After a moment, Ritsuko shrugged and went back to her work.  
律子看着美里，但美里没有回应。过了一会儿，律子耸了耸肩，继续她的工作。

An odd silence settled over the room, before Misato spoke up again. "Want to get some lunch now? I'm starving."  
房间里弥漫着一种奇怪的沉默，随后美里再次开口：“现在想不想去吃点午饭？我快饿死了。”

"Hmm, I don't think I can do that, you'll have to eat alone today. Or find someone else. I'm waiting on an important email and I can't leave my desktop right now."  
"嗯，我觉得我做不到，你今天得自己吃了。或者找别人吧。我在等一封重要的邮件，现在不能离开我的电脑。"

"Is it really that important? Worth skipping a meal over? Does it have something to do with that Rei business you talked about yesterday?"  
"真的有那么重要吗？值得为此错过一顿饭？是不是和昨天你提到的那个 Rei 的事情有关？"

"Rei? Oh, no, she's fine, no worries about her. And no, they're not skipping lunch."  
"Rei？哦，不，她没事，不用担心她。而且，他们并没有错过午餐。"

"Then?" "然后呢？"

"Have you ever heard the joke? That foreigners are weird, they always play soccer at dawn?"  
"你听过那个笑话吗？说外国人很奇怪，他们总在黎明时分踢足球。"

"Ah, so it's the European branches, right? Trouble with Berlin again?"  
"啊，那是指欧洲分部吧？柏林那边又出问题了？"

"No, not Europe this time. It's the U.S. They're working overtime on something pretty important, and I'm assisting them. It'll be over soon enough."  
"不，这次不是欧洲。是美国那边。他们在加班处理一件相当重要的事情，我正在协助他们。很快就会结束了。"

"Is this something I should know about?"  
"这是我有必要知道的吗？"

"In due time." "到时候自然会告诉你。"

"Huh." "嗯。"

With that, Ritsuko closed her mouth. Misato didn't feel the slightest inclination to probe any further, as her hunger was beginning to feel quite serious. She stood up from her seat. Ritsuko didn't even look at her.  
说完，律子闭上了嘴。美里丝毫没有继续追问的念头，因为她已经开始感到饥饿难耐。她从座位上站起身来。律子连看都没看她一眼。

"See ya." “再见。”

With her eyes still fixed on the monitor, Ritsuko raised her coffee cup as if in salute.  
律子的目光依旧停留在显示器上，她举起咖啡杯，仿佛在致意。

---

The lunch date was uneventful. No accidents, no major missteps.  
午餐约会平淡无奇。没有意外，也没有重大失误。

At first, Asuka thought about taking the train into the city center, getting a decent meal and then just wandering around. But then she remembered Shinji's physical problems and what he'd said about finances. It wasn't as if Asuka was short on pocket money or living paycheck to paycheck, but this date had been a spur-of-the-moment idea that Asuka had come up with at school, and she didn't want to take the chance of going to a random restaurant she hadn't checked out in advance and paying a lot of money for a potentially disappointing meal. She hated the possibility of disappointment, and she didn't want to take that risk if she could help it.  
起初，明日香考虑乘火车去市中心，吃顿像样的饭，然后随便逛逛。但她随即想起了真嗣的身体状况和他提到的财务问题。并非明日香手头拮据或过着月光族的生活，只是这次约会是在学校临时起意的想法，她不想冒险去一家事先未考察过的餐厅，花一大笔钱却可能吃到令人失望的饭菜。她讨厌失望的可能性，如果可以避免，她不想冒这个险。

Eventually, they entered the first cheap gyudon chain they found after walking around aimlessly, their hunger almost unbearable at that point. It was a small, crowded place, and the few tables that were there were full, forcing them to sit at the bar. Shinji visibly shrank as soon as he entered the establishment and asked Asuka if she wanted to go somewhere else, but Asuka, her hunger now dangerously close to transmuting into anger, refused. Shinji seemed to feel something akin to guilt at the thought of bringing her to such a place.  
最终，他们在漫无目的地游荡后，走进了找到的第一家廉价的牛丼连锁店，那时他们的饥饿感几乎到了难以忍受的地步。那是一个狭小拥挤的地方，仅有的几张桌子都坐满了人，迫使他们只能坐在吧台上。一进店，真嗣就明显地缩了缩身子，问明日香是否想换个地方，但明日香此刻的饥饿感已濒临转化为愤怒，她拒绝了。真嗣似乎对带她来这种地方感到一丝愧疚。

Asuka genuinely didn't care, though. It was Shinji being overly concerned. Half of Japanese food seemed to be fish-related, and they didn't seem to care about the smell either, so rice with sweet stir-fried beef was a welcome change. And she didn't mind sitting next to Shinji, even though it would have been uncomfortable in any other case. It was a different kind of intimacy than sitting across the table from each other like they usually did.  
但明日香其实并不介意。是真嗣过于担心了。日本食物的一半似乎都与鱼有关，而且他们似乎也不在乎那股味道，所以甜炒牛肉盖饭成了受欢迎的改变。而且她并不介意坐在真嗣旁边，尽管在其他情况下这可能会让人感到不适。这种亲密感与平时面对面坐着的感觉截然不同。

After that they hopped on the train and headed out of town. This time on Shinji's insistence. He knew a place with a good view, he said. Asuka followed him, although she would have rather gone home.  
之后他们搭乘火车离开了市区。这次是真嗣坚持的。他说他知道一个风景不错的地方。明日香跟着他，尽管她更愿意回家。

It turned out to be the kind of place that was hard to access without a car, so they had to walk up a hill for quite a while after getting off the train. Asuka wasn't even sure if they were still inside the administrative boundary of Tokyo-3. By the time they finally arrived at their destination, Asuka was sweating and the arm carrying her backpack had started to ache.  
结果那地方没有车很难到达，所以他们下了火车后不得不步行爬上一段相当长的山坡。明日香甚至不确定他们是否还在第三新东京市的行政边界内。当他们终于到达目的地时，明日香已经汗流浃背，背着背包的那只手臂也开始酸痛。

It turned out to be an observation deck of sorts, overlooking the caldera that housed the city. It wasn't very high up, but it still had a nice, unobstructed view of the surrounding area. There was even a paid telescope set up on a small fenced-in cliff face nearby, something you often saw in touristy places. There weren't any tourists around, though, just Shinji and Asuka. And neither of them had enough coins to operate the telescope.  
原来这里是一个观景台，俯瞰着容纳城市的环形山。虽然不算很高，但视野开阔，周围景色一览无余。附近还有一个收费的望远镜，安装在一个小围栏悬崖面上，这种设施在旅游景点很常见。不过，周围并没有游客，只有真嗣和明日香。而且他们俩都没有足够的硬币来操作望远镜。

Asuka walked up to the fence and set her bag down, then leaned back against it and looked at Shinji. A breeze from the lowlands ruffled her skirt and hair. "You wanted to show me this?"  
明日香走到围栏前放下背包，然后背靠着它看向真嗣。来自低地的微风拂动她的裙摆和发丝。“你带我来这里看什么？”

"Yeah. It's a nice view, right? I got to see the buildings come out of the ground the first time I came here. They're just standing today. Maybe it's more boring that way."  
“是啊。风景不错，对吧？我第一次来这里时，亲眼看着这些建筑从地面冒出来。今天它们只是静静地矗立着。也许这样更无聊些。”

Asuka tilted her head back to look down at the city. It wasn't a bad sight, but nothing special either. A large city, but not large enough to be called a proper metropolis. Moderately tall skyscrapers clustered in the core blocks. Square grids stretched out in all directions, ending up in relatively sparse suburbs. On the opposite side of the city, she could glimpse Lake Ashi between the buildings. If, as Shinji said, the armored sections were going up and down, or if they came at night and saw all the lights glittering beneath them, she might have felt differently, but under the bright sunlight of a Saturday afternoon, the city didn't look all that unusual. She had seen worse. And she had seen better.  
明日香仰头俯瞰着这座城市。景色不算差，但也并无特别之处。一座大城市，却又不至于大到被称为真正的大都会。中等高度的摩天大楼聚集在核心区域。方正的网格向四面八方延伸，最终融入相对稀疏的郊区。在城市的另一侧，她能透过建筑间的缝隙瞥见芦之湖。如果正如真嗣所说，那些装甲部分正在上下移动，或是他们在夜晚前来，看到下方灯火闪烁，她的感受或许会不同，但在周六下午的明媚阳光下，这座城市看起来并不那么特别。她见过更糟的，也见过更好的。

But to say so would disappoint Shinji. He had brought her this far, after all. So Asuka paused for a moment, wondering how else to put it. Shinji smiled, clueless as to Asuka's thoughts.  
但这样说会让真嗣失望的。毕竟是他带她来到这里的。于是明日香停顿了一下，思考着如何换种说法。真嗣微笑着，对明日香的心思一无所知。

"When I first came here, I mean, to the city, Ms. Misato brought me to this place. I think she did it to encourage me, to show me the place I've saved. She must have thought seeing Tokyo-3 like this would impress me."  
当我第一次来到这里，我是说，来到这座城市，Misato 小姐带我来了这个地方。我想她是想鼓励我，让我看看我拯救过的地方。她一定是觉得看到这样的第三新东京市会让我印象深刻。

The unexpected mention of Misato's name made something in Asuka harden. There was a strange, almost _longing_ quality to Shinji's voice that she didn't like one bit. He wasn't looking directly at her, his eyes on some faraway point in the city over her shoulder. She narrowed her own and then craned her neck. She could see cars, as small as ants. Even smaller people. Barely moving. Barely noticeable. Tiny, tiny little unimportant things.  
Misato 名字的意外提及让 Asuka 心中一紧。Shinji 的声音里有一种奇怪的、近乎渴望的特质，她一点也不喜欢。他没有直接看她，目光越过她的肩膀，投向城市中某个遥远的点。她眯起自己的眼睛，然后扭头望去。她能看到汽车，小得像蚂蚁一样。更小的人。几乎不动。几乎不引人注意。微不足道的小东西。

Asuka saw Shinji coming toward her in the periphery of her vision. She turned to look at him. Shinji was no longer watching the city. His eyes were on her now. Finally. Asuka smirked.  
Asuka 在视野边缘看到 Shinji 朝她走来。她转过身去看他。Shinji 不再注视城市。他的目光现在落在她身上。终于。Asuka 微微一笑。

"What do you see now?"  
"你现在看到了什么？"

Shinji stopped in his tracks. His eyebrows rose slightly. He was blushing, lips twitching a few times as if he wanted to say something but couldn't. Asuka waited in growing anticipation. This time, he met her expectations.  
真嗣停下了脚步，微微挑起眉毛。他的脸颊泛红，嘴唇几次抽动，似乎想说些什么却又说不出口。明日香满怀期待地等待着。这一次，他没有让她失望。

"You. Asuka. Only you." "你。明日香。只有你。"

A happy noise escaped her throat. Asuka lifted her hands from the fence and cupped Shinji's cheeks, looking deeply into his eyes. Blue eyes. A little darker than hers, but a similar color anyway.  
她喉咙里发出一声欢快的声音。明日香从栅栏上抬起双手，捧住真嗣的脸颊，深深地凝视着他的眼睛。蓝色的眼睛。比她的稍深一些，但颜色相似。

It would have been natural for them to kiss right then and there, but for some reason, Asuka didn't bridge the gap. Shinji didn't either. Instead, she kept looking into his eyes, and he looked into hers. A warm breeze rustled the dry grass around the overlook. Distant sounds of the city filtered up to them: horns honking, a motor roaring. Asuka couldn't stop the small smile from appearing on her satisfaction his response to her question had engendered in her was warm like the sunlight beating down on them. The amount of it felt almost disproportionate to the situation. Asuka decided that she didn't care.  
按理说，他们那时那地接吻再自然不过，但不知为何，明日香没有缩短距离。真嗣也没有。相反，她继续凝视着他的眼睛，而他回望着她的。一阵温暖的微风吹过瞭望台周围的干草。远处城市的喧嚣声传到他们耳中：喇叭声、引擎轰鸣声。明日香无法抑制住那因他的回答而引发的满足感所带来的一丝微笑，这感觉温暖如洒在他们身上的阳光。这种感觉似乎与情境不成比例。明日香决定她不在乎。

It occurred to her, then, that never before had anything or anyone been so surely Asuka's than Shinji was now. She wondered if the boy even realized how special he was to her, and if she was as special to him.  
就在那时，她意识到，从未有任何事物或人像现在的真嗣一样，如此确凿无疑地属于明日香。她不知道男孩是否意识到自己对她有多特别，也不知道自己对他是否同样特别。

The thought made Asuka's heart sink. She wrapped her arms around Shinji. It was only when he groaned and winced that Asuka realized her mistake. Shinji spent the next few minutes squatting on the ground, clenching his teeth, before he was able to move again.  
这个念头让明日香的心沉了下去。她紧紧抱住真嗣。直到他呻吟着皱眉，明日香才意识到自己的错误。接下来的几分钟里，真嗣蹲在地上，紧咬牙关，直到他又能动弹。

When they got home after that, it was a bit later than usual. It was closer to dinner than lunch, but Asuka didn't mind. It was time well spent, after all.  
那天回家后，时间比平时晚了一些。已经接近晚餐而非午餐时分，但明日香并不介意。毕竟，这段时间是值得的。

Leaving Shinji behind to deal with the apparently very angry penguin, Asuka went straight to the bathroom and took a shower. She didn't even bring new clothes from her room, but it didn't matter. By the time Asuka emerged from the bathroom again, dripping wet and wearing only a towel, the penguin was already gone and Shinji was washing the beast's bowl in the sink. Asuka walked leisurely toward him and smiled with satisfaction when she saw Shinji's face flush as he turned around.  
留下真嗣独自面对那只显然非常生气的企鹅，明日香径直走向浴室并洗了个澡。她甚至没从房间里带新衣服过来，但这无关紧要。当明日香再次从浴室出来时，浑身湿漉漉的，只裹着一条毛巾，那只企鹅已经不见了，而真嗣正在水槽里清洗那只野兽的碗。明日香悠闲地走向他，看到真嗣转过身来时脸颊泛红，她满意地笑了。

"Aren't you going to wash? It was hot today."  
“你不打算洗吗？今天挺热的。”

Shinji pointed to the sink. "After this. And I have to prepare for dinner, too. Have to thaw some meat."  
真嗣指了指水槽。“洗完这个再说。而且我还得准备晚饭，得解冻一些肉。”

_Such a housewife_, Asuka thought. She nodded and headed for her room when Shinji called her. "Oh, and..."  
"真是个家庭主妇样，明日香心想。她点头朝自己房间走去，这时真嗣叫住了她。“哦，还有……””

"What?" "什么？"

"Ms. Misato will be here soon, so, uhm..."  
"“美里小姐很快就会来了，所以，呃……””

_Ah, yeah, Misato. It's about time. What vile trick she would try to pull us apart this time, I wonder.  
啊，对，美里。是时候了。这次她又会耍什么卑鄙手段来拆散我们呢，我在想。_

Asuka barely managed to stop the frown from appearing on her face. Today had been a very good day. She didn't want to spoil it, so she shrugged her shoulders and said the first thing that came to mind.  
明日香勉强忍住了皱眉的冲动。今天是个非常美好的日子。她不想破坏它，于是耸了耸肩，随口说了句想到的话。

"So what? You want me to help you in the kitchen while wearing only an apron and nothing else? You're a pervert, you like that kind of thing, don't you? I bet you've imagined something like that a lot. You said so yesterday."  
“那又怎样？你想让我只穿个围裙、什么都不穿地在厨房帮你？你真是个变态，就喜欢这种事，对吧？我敢打赌你昨天就这么想了。”

His cheeks had been a cute pink hue before, but at her words his whole face lit up red like a stoplight. Asuka smiled in satisfaction at the sight, all the while adding an entry to her 'to do' list. Seriously, there were endless possibilities between them that they hadn't even tried yet, like feeding him from his lap, and then what she'd just said, and other, still more intriguing things. Just the mere thought of it was so exciting it sent a shiver down her spine.  
他的脸颊原本是可爱的粉红色，但听了她的话后，整张脸红得像交通灯一样。明日香满意地笑了，同时在她‘待办事项’清单上又加了一项。说真的，他们之间还有无数的可能性未曾尝试，比如从他腿上喂他吃东西，还有她刚才说的那些，以及其他更令人兴奋的事情。光是想想就让她激动得脊背发凉。

"Asuka…!" "明日香…！"

Leaving Shinji to mutter behind her back, Asuka made a teasing motion with her hips as she walked toward her room. She could feel his eyes on her barely covered ass along with a cool breeze, and it was intentional.  
无视身后真嗣的低语，明日香扭动着臀部，挑逗地走向自己的房间。她能感觉到他的目光盯着自己几乎遮不住的臀部，还有那阵凉风，这都是她有意为之的。

Once in her room, Asuka took her hair out of the towel it had been wrapped in. It had dried enough, so she combed some heat protectant through it with her fingers before pinning it up in sections on her head. Then she began to blow dry a section of hair, carefully running the instrument up and down the length of it until it was dried to her satisfaction before moving on to the next one. She repeated this process several times, and hummed throughout all of it. It was a bit silly, she found herself thinking as she swapped the blow dryer for the flat iron, but she also couldn't bring herself to stop.  
一进房间，明日香便解开了裹在头发上的毛巾。头发已经干得差不多了，她用手指梳理了一些热保护剂，然后将头发分段固定在头顶。接着，她开始吹干一部分头发，小心翼翼地用吹风机上下移动，直到满意为止，再换到下一部分。她重复了这个过程几次，全程都在哼着小曲。她觉得这有点傻，当她把吹风机换成平板夹时，心里想着，但她就是停不下来。

After finishing her hair routine, Asuka took the towel off her body, draped it over the bed, then sat on it and began to apply lotion to her body. The soft, pleasant scent of it spread through the room. The smell was all too familiar to Asuka, as she'd been using the same brand almost since she'd started shaving. It was an almost homey smell, although it started as a desperate measure to get rid of the stink of LCL that stubbornly clung to her no matter how many times she'd shower.  
完成头发护理后，明日香解下身上的毛巾，将其铺在床上，然后坐下开始涂抹身体乳。那柔和宜人的香气在房间里弥漫开来。这味道对明日香来说再熟悉不过了，自从她开始剃毛以来，几乎一直在使用同一个品牌。它几乎有种家的味道，尽管最初是为了摆脱那股顽固的 LCL 臭味而采取的绝望措施，无论她洗多少次澡都挥之不去。

Well, it wasn't even her idea, come to think of it. It was a solution offered by her handler at the time, Misato in response to Asuka's complaints. Come to think of it, this was the same brand that Misato had recommended back then.  
说起来，这甚至不是她的主意。回想起来，这是当时她的负责人美里针对明日香的抱怨提出的解决方案。再想想，这正是美里那时推荐的品牌。

Asuka looked down at the jar of cream beside her, narrowing her eyes. Body cream was something you used a lot, and the most recent jar she'd opened was already nearly half empty. The spares she'd brought from Germany were almost gone, too. She'd have to buy a batch soon.  
明日香低头看着身边的乳霜罐，眯起了眼睛。身体乳是日常大量使用的东西，最近打开的那罐已经快用掉一半了。从德国带来的备用装也所剩无几。她很快就得再买一批了。

_I should try a new brand_, Asuka thought. It wasn't necessarily because the previous one was Misato's suggestion; she'd been using the same one for years and maybe it was time for a change, and besides, importing things was expensive. Japan was supposed to have high quality beauty products, too, so there was no reason to not try something local.  
或许我该试试新品牌，明日香心想。这并非因为之前的品牌是美里推荐的；她已经用了多年，也许是时候换换了，而且进口商品价格不菲。日本本就以高品质的美容产品著称，所以尝试本土产品并无不妥。

But somehow, Asuka couldn't shake the feeling of unease. Probably because she had thought about Misato. So Asuka concentrated on the motion of applying the cream, starting with her left shoulder and working her way down her arm, all the while trying to think of something else.  
但不知为何，明日香总感到一丝不安。大概是因为她想到了美里。于是明日香专注于涂抹乳霜的动作，从左肩开始，顺着胳膊往下，同时努力想着其他事情。

_Should I take Shinji with me? When I buy a new cream? And ask him what kind of scents he likes?  
我该带真嗣一起去吗？买新乳霜的时候？顺便问问他喜欢什么香味？_

The thought brought a smile back to Asuka's lips. Yeah, that didn't sound like a bad idea. And she needed to think of pleasant things more, not crappy things she didn't need to be reminded of. Today was a good day. There were still concerns regarding Shinji, but nonetheless, they were largely lovely again.  
这个念头让明日香嘴角再次上扬。是啊，这听起来并不坏。她需要多想些愉快的事情，而不是那些不需被提醒的糟糕回忆。今天是个好日子。虽然对真嗣还有些担忧，但总体上，他们又变得相当美好了。

She felt a little silly for letting her thoughts wander to Shinji again, but so what? The boy was there right now, just one door away, by her side, seeing only her. Why should she feel ashamed to think of him when he was probably thinking of her, too?  
她觉得自己又想到真嗣有点傻，但那又怎样？那男孩此刻就在门外，近在咫尺，眼里只有她。当他也可能在想着她时，她为何要为想到他而感到羞愧呢？

Asuka recalled her time in the Berlin branch. She remembered the times she got out of the shower and went through her routine, just like she did now. The room back then was so quiet. A time when she had nothing to do, nothing to look forward to other than the war, checking her phone every few minutes to see if Mr. Kaji sent any messages. A time when she didn't have a housemate to feed her and cherish her and blush at the sight of her.  
明日香回想起在柏林分部的那段时光。她记得自己洗完澡后例行公事的样子，就像现在这样。那时的房间异常安静。那是一个无所事事、除了战争别无期待的时刻，每隔几分钟就查看手机，看加持先生是否发了消息。那时她没有室友来喂养她、珍惜她，也没有人因看到她而脸红。

At the time, she took it as something normal. Not now. Honestly, Asuka didn't think she could go back to that time. It felt unbearable just to think of the possibility.  
那时，她只觉得这是寻常之事。如今却不然。老实说，明日香不认为自己能回到那个时刻。光是想到这种可能性，就让她觉得难以忍受。

_It means you've become weak, Asuka. It's not something you could boast about. At all.  
这意味着你变弱了，明日香。这可不是什么值得炫耀的事。一点儿也不。_

Asuka furrowed her brow at the sudden thought. She snorted and tried to ignore it, but it didn't work as well as she thought.  
明日香因这突如其来的念头皱起了眉头。她哼了一声，试图忽视它，但效果并不如她所想的那样好。

Her hands paused their work. Asuka sat still for a moment. Her chest and stomach were all done, so next were her legs. The red scratches came into view. She grimaced.  
她的双手停下了动作。明日香静坐片刻。胸前和腹部已经处理完毕，接下来是双腿。红色的抓痕映入眼帘。她皱起了眉头。

_I'm all scratched up! I can't put cream on these. Ugh. I couldn't even shave, really._ She ran a finger over a patch of unblemished skin between the cuts. It was unpleasantly prickly.  
我浑身都是划痕！这些地方涂不了药膏。唉。连刮毛都做不到。她用手指抚过一处未受伤的皮肤，感觉刺刺的不舒服。

As she contemplated, there was a knock on the door.  
正当她沉思时，门外传来了一阵敲门声。

"Asuka, can I come in?"  
"明日香，我可以进来吗？"

"Come in." "进来吧。"

She answered absentmindedly, her head crowded with different thoughts. She forgot she was sitting cross-legged on the bed, completely naked, with one leg lifted. She realized it only after Shinji froze in place as he stepped half a foot into the room, staring at her.  
她心不在焉地回答，脑海中充斥着各种思绪。她忘了自己正盘腿坐在床上，一丝不挂，一条腿还抬着。直到真嗣半只脚踏进房间，愣在原地盯着她看时，她才意识到这一点。

"Ah, well…" Asuka paused in confusion, pulling up the towel she'd been sitting on with one hand. Come to think of it, he'd seen more of her many times already, and most of those occasions were through Asuka's initiative. Sometimes playfully. Sometimes pushily, almost angrily. Sometimes in a whirlwind of desire. It was a bit odd to act all shy now. But she already reacted awkwardly, so how could she make it look natural from here?  
“啊，这个……”明日香困惑地停顿了一下，用一只手拉起她坐着的毛巾。话说回来，他早已多次见过她的更多部分，而且大多数时候都是明日香主动的。有时是调皮的。有时是强硬的，几乎带着怒气。有时是在欲望的旋风中。现在装作害羞有点奇怪。但她已经反应得有些尴尬了，接下来怎么才能显得自然呢？

Before Asuka could think of a plan, Shinji surprised her. He strode into the room, closing the door behind him, and came straight to Asuka. The blush on his face was even redder than the one she'd seen in the kitchen earlier, almost on the verge of thermonuclear explosion, but he never took his eyes off her and didn't stop. Asuka froze, unable to move or react.  
在明日香还没想出计划之前，真嗣出乎意料地让她吃了一惊。他大步走进房间，关上门，径直走向明日香。他脸上的红晕比之前在厨房里看到的还要红，几乎快要达到热核爆炸的程度，但他始终没有移开视线，也没有停下来。明日香僵住了，无法移动或做出反应。

_Is he trying to jump on me?  
他这是想扑上来吗？_

Maybe she teased him too much today and pushed his patience past its limits, although this time it was unintentional. Maybe Asuka had crossed a line that made Shinji forget about his physical condition.  
或许今天她逗弄他过头了，无意间将他的耐心推至极限。也许明日香越界了，让真嗣忘记了自身的身体状况。

And that was supposed to be the very thing she wanted. She's been consistently goading him towards it. But now that the possibility of it had materialized in front of her, she was frozen like a deer caught in the headlights. Even when Shinji walked to the front of the bed, knelt down, and gently grabbed her foot, Asuka couldn't move. Instead she closed her eyes tightly.  
而这本是她一直渴望的。她一直在不断刺激他朝这个方向前进。但如今这一可能性真实呈现在她面前时，她却像被车灯照住的鹿一样僵住了。即使真嗣走到床前，跪下，温柔地握住她的脚，明日香也无法动弹。相反，她紧紧闭上了眼睛。

_Why my foot though_? she thought inanely. _If you put it in your mouth or something I'll never kiss you again. Maybe that's too much, actually, but I still won't kiss you for at least a week._  
为什么是我的脚呢？她无意义地想着。如果放进嘴里什么的，我绝对不会再吻你了。也许那太过分了，实际上，但至少一周内我都不会吻你。

Just like that, she was expecting a tongue, or lips, so she flinched and opened her eyes in surprise when something cold touched her shin. Shinji was holding a small tube in one hand. It looked like an ointment or something similar. Shinji actually seemed a little surprised by Asuka's reaction. She felt like an idiot.  
就这样，她以为会有一条舌头或嘴唇靠近，所以当某个冰凉的东西触碰到她的小腿时，她吓了一跳，惊讶地睁开了眼睛。真嗣手里拿着一个小管子。看起来像是药膏之类的东西。真嗣对明日香的反应似乎也有点惊讶。她觉得自己像个傻瓜。

"Um, Asuka, does that hurt _that_ much?"  
“呃，明日香，那很疼吗？”

Asuka cleared her throat. Her panic had worn off now, and her normal nonchalance was returning. "Of course not. I'm not a child, I can totally take this. It was just a bit too cold and it freaked me out. You know what spinal reflex is, right?"  
明日香清了清嗓子。她的恐慌已经消退，正常的漫不经心又回来了。“当然不疼。我又不是小孩子，完全能承受。只是有点太冷了，吓了我一跳。你知道脊髓反射是什么吧？”

Now that her surprise had subsided, a slight embarrassment took its place. If Shinji somehow found out what she'd been thinking, she just might die. Asuka studied Shinji's face, wondering if he'd gotten any hint. Shinji, to Asuka's relief, averted his gaze from her prying eyes. His eyes stopped somewhere between the floor and her foot. He started with hesitation.  
惊喜感消退后，一丝尴尬取而代之。如果真嗣不知怎么知道了她的心思，她可能会羞愧至死。明日香仔细观察着真嗣的脸，想知道他是否察觉到了什么。令她松一口气的是，真嗣避开了她探究的目光，眼神停留在地板和她脚之间的某个位置。他犹豫着开口。

"Asuka, would you mind covering, you know... there? It's not that I hate it or something, but it's distracting me..."  
“明日香，你介意遮一下，呃...那里吗？我不是讨厌什么的，但它让我分心了...”

If things had been any different, Asuka would have teased Shinji to no end, saying things like, 'What exactly bothers you?' 'Was there something you wanted to do?' and other such playful jabs, but right now she was so flustered that she wasn't quite able to muster up the inspiration. Instead, Asuka meekly pulled the towel up to cover herself. With a small sigh, Shinji squeezed the medicine out of the tube and applied it to the scratches on Asuka's leg, spreading it with his fingers. A cold sensation ran up her body once again.  
"如果情况不同，明日香可能会无休止地逗弄真嗣，说些诸如“到底是什么让你困扰？”“你是不是想做点什么？”之类的俏皮话，但此刻她太过慌乱，无法想出这些点子。于是，明日香温顺地拉起毛巾遮住自己。真嗣轻叹一声，挤出药膏涂抹在明日香腿上的擦伤处，用手指轻轻抹开。一股凉意再次传遍她的身体。

The squatting position must have been uncomfortable, as Shinji sat down soon. When his butt met the floor Shinji groaned, clenching his teeth. There must have been a shock when he sat down. And it was only then that Asuka realized she was imagining absurd things. Shinji was sick, he needed to rest, and ravishing her was probably the last thing on his mind right now. She also realized she should have just come home as soon as school was over instead of dragging him around for hours on some stupid date. She wondered if he was hurting while they were walking around earlier and had just not said anything.  
蹲着的姿势肯定不舒服，不久后真嗣便坐了下来。当他的臀部触地时，真嗣呻吟了一声，紧咬牙关。他坐下时一定受到了冲击。直到这时，明日香才意识到自己在想象一些荒谬的事情。真嗣生病了，他需要休息，而现在他脑子里可能根本就没有想着要侵犯她。她也意识到自己本应在放学后立刻回家，而不是拖着他到处逛了几个小时的愚蠢约会。她不知道他们在之前散步时他是否感到疼痛，只是没有说出来。

_Why am I like this.  
我为什么会这样。_

Even as Asuka thought that, she couldn't find a soft word to say to Shinji, and she hated herself for it. And she hated herself for hating herself. And at this rate, she would eventually hate sharing a space with Shinji, because he kept making her feel sorry. If he was gone, she wouldn't be this uncomfortable. But she found herself hating that idea, too. Because that would also mean the hand gently squeezing her foot and stroking her leg would be gone as well.  
尽管明日香这么想着，她却找不到一句温柔的话对真嗣说，这让她痛恨自己。她痛恨自己的这种自我厌恶。照这样下去，她最终会讨厌与真嗣共处一室，因为他让她感到内疚。如果他不在了，她就不会这么不舒服。但她发现自己也讨厌这个想法。因为那也意味着那只温柔地握着她的脚、轻抚她腿的手也将消失。

Shinji broke the silence Asuka had made.  
真嗣打破了明日香营造的沉默。

"I'm sorry, Asuka." “对不起，明日香。”

Asuka tilted her head. "You're sorry? For what?"  
明日香歪了歪头。“你道歉？为了什么？”

Shinji's fingers once again spread the ointment on Asuka's leg.  
真嗣的手指再次将药膏涂抹在明日香的小腿上。

"These scratches are so obvious, but I didn't realize it until the Class Rep pointed it out. I was too busy in the morning, I guess. Maybe I wasn't a perceptive enough boyfriend. I'm still not used to this whole thing..."  
“这些擦伤这么明显，但直到班长指出来我才注意到。早上太忙了吧，或许我这个男朋友还不够细心。对这一切我还是不太习惯……”

Asuka let out a small groan. She hadn't really cared that much about the scratches to begin with, and Shinji noticing it late was, well…she didn't care about it that much either, especially after the date had made her feel so good. It was Shinji's apology that made her feel somewhat bad. Like she was a bad person, or something. It was a sort of a burden, although it also warmed her heart.  
明日香发出一声轻微的呻吟。她原本并没有太在意这些擦伤，真嗣注意到得晚，嗯……她也没太放在心上，尤其是在约会让她感觉如此美好之后。是真嗣的道歉让她觉得有些内疚。好像她是个坏人似的。这是一种负担，尽管也温暖了她的心。

Perhaps encouraged by such warmth, Asuka did something she wouldn't normally do.  
或许是受到了这种温暖的鼓舞，明日香做了一件她通常不会做的事。

"If you weren't feeling well earlier, I'm sorry. Maybe we should have just come home right after school."  
“如果你之前感觉不舒服，我很抱歉。也许我们应该放学后就直接回家。”

Shinji looked up at Asuka and blinked. His mouth opened and closed once or twice. Asuka realized that this might have been the first time she'd ever apologized to the boy. It was a weird notion, but no matter how hard she tried, Asuka couldn't think of any instances where she'd done so in the past.  
真嗣抬头看着明日香，眨了眨眼。他的嘴巴张开又闭上了一两次。明日香意识到，这可能是她第一次向这个男孩道歉。这个念头很奇怪，但无论她怎么努力，明日香都想不起过去有任何这样的例子。

Shinji's hand on her leg jolted Asuka out of her reverie. He was applying ointment again. This time on the side closer to her knee where the scratches were wider and worse. Shinji frowned at them for a moment.  
真嗣的手触碰到她的腿，让明日香从沉思中惊醒。他又在涂抹药膏了。这次是在靠近膝盖的一侧，那里的擦伤更宽更严重。真嗣对着那些伤口皱了皱眉。

"I'm fine. Except for the time you hugged me too hard, I had no problem. It's not like I broke my leg or anything. I'm more mobile than I thought I'd be yesterday. And eating out was nice, too."  
“我没事。除了你抱得太紧的那次，我一点问题都没有。又不是腿断了什么的。我比昨天预想的要灵活多了。而且出去吃饭也挺好的。”

Asuka winced a little. Her knee stung.  
明日香微微皱眉。她的膝盖刺痛着。

"I thought you liked eating at home?"  
"我以为你喜欢在家吃饭？"

Shinji's hand paused for a moment, then resumed its movement.  
真嗣的手停顿了一下，随即又继续动了起来。

"Yeah, I guess, but..." "嗯，我想是吧，但是..."

"But?" “但是？”

Shinji shook his head with a faint smile. "It's hard to explain."  
真嗣微微一笑，摇了摇头。“很难解释。”

"Tell me anyway." “无论如何告诉我吧。”

But Shinji stubbornly kept his mouth shut, just squeezing more medicine out of the tube. Asuka hadn't cared much about the issue until a moment ago, but now that he was behaving like this, she had to have an answer.  
但真嗣固执地闭口不言，只是从管子里挤出更多的药膏。明日香之前对此并不太在意，但此刻他这般表现，她非得要个答案不可。

Asuka leaned down. The towel she haphazardly wrapped around her body slipped along, but Asuka let it. The slip itself was unintentional, but perhaps it would help distract Shinji.  
明日香俯下身来。她随意裹在身上的毛巾顺势滑落，但明日香并未在意。这滑落虽是无意之举，或许却能分散真嗣的注意力。

"Tell me. And look at me when I'm talking to you. You're being rude."  
“告诉我。还有，我说话时看着我。你这样很没礼貌。”

Shinji looked up, and his eyes instantly widened. Asuka could even hear the sound of saliva sliding down his throat. It was so funny to see him react this way. It was as if he was a machine that reacted exactly as it was supposed to at the push of a button. Even after seeing her several times, even after having touched her nearly as often.  
真嗣抬起头，目光立刻瞪大了。明日香甚至能听到他喉咙里唾液滑动的声音。看他这样反应真是太有趣了。仿佛他是一台机器，按下按钮就精确地做出应有的反应。即便已经多次见过她，即便几乎同样频繁地触碰过她。

Shinji licked his lips nervously. "Literally. It's complicated. I don't even know how to explain it myself."  
真嗣紧张地舔了舔嘴唇。“字面意思。这很复杂。我自己都不知道怎么解释。”

"I bet you're just lying. You don't want to tell me, is that it? What's so important about it?"  
“我敢打赌你只是在撒谎。你不想告诉我，是吗？这有什么重要的？”

Asuka belatedly realized there was a hint of irritation in her voice. It wasn't intentional; she was still in a pretty good mood. Though if Shinji continued to be this stubborn, there was no telling what might happen.  
明日香后知后觉地意识到自己的声音中带着一丝恼怒。这并非有意为之；她的心情其实还不错。但如果真嗣继续这么固执，谁知道会发生什么。

Shinji turned his head to look away from Asuka. His hand stopped moving, too. Asuka couldn't tell if he was lost in thought or just sulking. Maybe both. Asuka, feeling a little impatient after some moments of waiting, was about to ask what the hell was wrong with him when Shinji spoke again.  
真嗣转过头，不再看明日香。他的手也停了下来。明日香分不清他是在沉思还是只是在闹别扭。或许两者都有。等待片刻后，明日香感到有些不耐烦，正要问他到底怎么了，这时真嗣又开口了。

"I guess I do like eating at home, but it became a little weird the more I thought about it. It's not something I started to do myself because I genuinely preferred it, I just did it because I had to and no one ever told me to stop. Like the cello. I'm not sure if I actually like doing it. Maybe it's the compliments I get from cooking, and not the act itself. And that made me wonder if I even really like anything. Everything in my life was like that."  
“我想我确实喜欢在家吃饭，但越想越觉得有点奇怪。这不是我自己开始做的，因为我真的喜欢，我只是不得不这样做，而且从来没有人告诉我要停下来。就像大提琴一样。我不确定我是否真的喜欢做这件事。也许是因为我从烹饪中得到的赞美，而不是行为本身。这让我怀疑我是否真的喜欢任何东西。我生活中的每件事都是这样的。

Asuka blinked. The realization that struck her at the moment was a bit disconcerting. This was the first time she'd heard anything about Shinji's personal life and thoughts and habits. The only thing that was even a bit similar to this was that time in the kitchen when he was on top of her, but even that was, ultimately, a matter that directly concerned Asuka, not something completely Shinji's.  
明日香眨了眨眼。那一刻她意识到的真相有些令人不安。这是她第一次听到关于真嗣个人生活、思想和习惯的事情。唯一与此有些相似的是那次在厨房里，他在她上面，但即便那样，最终也是直接关系到明日香的事情，而不是完全属于真嗣的。

It was a weirdly overwhelming notion. And there were so many fundamentally strange thoughts and ideas mixed in there, so Asuka picked out the one thing that stood out the most and was the easiest to touch. "Cello? What was that thing about a cello?"  
"这想法出奇地让人难以承受。其中混杂着太多根本性的奇怪念头和想法，于是明日香挑出了最突出、最容易触及的那一点。“大提琴？那东西和大提琴有什么关系？””

Shinji looked up. Apparently, he hadn't expected the question, or had forgotten that he mentioned it at all. Asuka smiled slightly, finding his confused face endearing.  
真嗣抬起头来。显然，他没料到会被问到这个问题，或者已经完全忘记自己提到过它。明日香微微一笑，觉得他困惑的表情很可爱。

"You know how to play the cello?"  
“你会拉大提琴吗？”

Shinji nodded. 真嗣点了点头。

"Why didn't you ever show me?"  
“你为什么不曾展示给我看？”

Shinji's eyes darted to and fro. "Uhm, because I never had a chance to...?"  
真嗣的目光四处游移。“呃，因为我一直没有机会……？”

"What chance? Are you telling me I should have given it to you? That I should've asked you for it? How can I ask for something I don't even know about?"  
"什么机会？你是说我应该把它给你？我应该向你要吗？我怎么可能要一个我根本不知道的东西？"

Shinji let out a small groan. Maybe she was being a little too accusatory. She lifted the foot that Shinji wasn't grabbing and gave him a swat on the arm.  
真嗣发出一声轻微的呻吟。也许她有点过于指责了。她抬起那只没有被真嗣抓住的脚，轻轻地在他手臂上拍了一下。

"You're going to show me soon, right?" _I would have been pretty genuinely impressed._  
"你很快就会展示给我看的，对吧？" 我本来会真的感到很佩服的。

Shinji nodded, and a silence descended with it. But it wasn't anything long or particularly uncomfortable. Shinji began to squeeze the tube again. Asuka broke the silence first, since unlike Shinji, she had nothing else to do.  
真嗣点点头，随之而来的是一阵沉默。但这沉默并不漫长，也不特别令人不适。真嗣又开始挤压管子。由于不像真嗣有事可做，明日香率先打破了沉默。

"So, you like it, right?"  
“所以，你喜欢它，对吧？”

Shinji glanced at her, a question in his eyes.  
真嗣瞥了她一眼，眼中带着疑问。

_Say you do_. With a strange impatience, Asuka studied Shinji's face. She didn't know why she felt that way, but she did.  
说你愿意。带着一种莫名的急切，明日香仔细观察着真嗣的脸。她不知道自己为何会有这种感觉，但她确实如此。

Then a small smile tugged at Shinji's mouth, and Asuka's heart seemed to melt at the sight of it. "Yeah. I guess so."  
然后，真嗣嘴角勾起一丝微笑，明日香看到这一幕，心似乎都融化了。“嗯，我想是的。”

"Yeah, who cares why or how it started. As long as you like it, that's enough."  
“是啊，谁在乎它为何或如何开始的呢。只要你喜欢，那就足够了。”

"You're right." "你说得对。"

The corners of his mouth turned up a bit more as he said that. His touch as he applied ointment to her leg lightened, too. Right after finishing the large scratches that were right below her knee, he even flicked her knee with his still-sticky finger.  
他说这话时，嘴角微微上扬。当他为她腿上涂抹药膏时，手上的动作也变得轻柔了些。刚处理完她膝盖下方的大片擦伤，他甚至用还沾着药膏的手指轻轻弹了一下她的膝盖。

"And now the other side..."  
"现在换另一边..."

Asuka lifted the opposite foot, but instead of giving it to Shinji, she pointed it straight at his face. Shinji froze, evidently thrown off-balance. Asuka belatedly saw where his eyes were looking and realized this was not a good angle, but she didn't care. It didn't matter.  
明日香抬起另一只脚，却没有递给真嗣，而是直直地指向他的脸。真嗣僵住了，显然被打乱了平衡。明日香后知后觉地注意到他的视线所在，意识到这个角度不太妙，但她并不在意。这无关紧要。

"See, it's good to talk. Don't clam up all the time like you're a mussel or something."  
“看吧，交流是有益的。别总是像只蛤蜊一样闭口不言。”

With that, Asuka curled her toes and cupped Shinji's cheek with them, and pulled his face up. Shinji opened his mouth to protest, but with one corner of his mouth being forcibly pulled up all the way to his ear, all he could manage was a stupid grunt.  
说完，明日香蜷起脚趾，用它们轻触真嗣的脸颊，将他的脸抬起。真嗣张嘴想要抗议，但一边嘴角被强行拉扯到耳边，他只能发出一声愚蠢的咕哝。

"Feeling good, huh? I see you're smiling like an idiot. I mean, you are an idiot. It fits."  
"感觉不错，是吧？看你笑得像个傻子。我是说，你本来就是个傻子。挺合适的。"

It was Asuka who burst out laughing, though. Shinji finally came to his senses and tilted his head back hard, untangling himself from Asuka's foot.  
是明日香先爆发出笑声的。真嗣终于回过神来，用力向后仰头，从明日香的脚边挣脱出来。

"Stop, Asuka. Don't. I mean it."  
"住手，明日香。别这样。我是认真的。"

But even as he spoke, the corner of his mouth didn't come down even a bit from where Asuka's foot had just placed it. Asuka didn't even give Shinji a chance to finish his feeble protest before resuming her attack. Shinji groaned and tried to pull back, but he was kneeling in front of her and there were only so many angles he could maneuver from such a position. Asuka didn't allow him the slightest bit of leeway, either, because as soon as he started moving she sent the foot that was previously in Shinji's hand to behind Shinji's shoulder and pulled him in. All the while Asuka tried to grab Shinji's cheek with her other foot. Shinji quickly jerked his head back to avoid it. The small room filled with the sounds of their laughter and struggle.  
但即便他开口说话，嘴角仍未从明日香脚掌刚落之处挪动分毫。明日香连让真嗣完成那微弱抗议的机会都不给，便再度发起攻势。真嗣呻吟着试图后退，奈何他跪在她面前，能调整的角度实在有限。明日香也不给他丝毫喘息之机，他刚一动弹，她便将原先在他手中的脚移至他肩后，顺势拉近。与此同时，明日香另一脚试图抓向真嗣的脸颊。真嗣迅速后仰躲闪。狭小的房间内，两人的笑声与挣扎声交织回荡。

If it had been her hand, Shinji would have just knocked it away without much trouble. But Shinji couldn't do the same with Asuka's feet. He couldn't touch her legs, either, because her shins were full of red and brown cuts and he didn't dare touch them with any strength, let alone grab them. Taking advantage of such hesitation from his side, Asuka grabbed his ear with her right toes and shook his head, almost viciously. The look in his face was so funny Asuka bent over and giggled, but in doing so, her toes slipped off and she lost her grip on him.  
如果是她的手，真嗣可能轻易就能将其拍开。但面对明日香的双脚，真嗣却无法如法炮制。他也不敢触碰她的双腿，因为她的胫骨上满是红褐色的伤痕，他不敢用力触碰，更别提抓住它们了。趁他犹豫之际，明日香用右脚趾夹住他的耳朵，猛烈地摇晃他的头，几乎带着几分狠劲。他脸上的表情如此滑稽，让明日香忍不住弯腰咯咯笑了起来，但这样一来，她的脚趾滑脱，失去了对他的控制。

Shinji did not miss his chance. His hands shot up and caught both of Asuka's calves. Sensing danger, Asuka sucked in a breath and tried to pull herself up, but there was no way out of his grip. Unlike her shins, her calves were unharmed, so Shinji had no qualms with strengthening his grip. He didn't grasp her very hard, but it was more than enough to unbalance Asuka.  
真嗣没有错过这个机会。他的双手迅速上扬，抓住了明日香的两条小腿。察觉到危险，明日香深吸一口气，试图挣脱，但他的掌握牢不可破。与她的胫骨不同，她的小腿完好无损，因此真嗣毫不犹豫地加强了握力。他并没有抓得很紧，但足以让明日香失去平衡。

Under other circumstances, she still might have gotten away, but it was impossible now. Asuka didn't dare kick him because his face was too near, and she couldn't even struggle too hard because she could accidentally hit his chest or side at this angle. She was frozen in place, not knowing what to do.  
在其他情况下，她或许还能逃脱，但此刻已无可能。明日香不敢踢他，因为他的脸靠得太近，她也不敢太用力挣扎，因为这样可能会不小心打到他的胸口或侧边。她僵在原地，不知所措。

Then Shinji yanked her legs with all his might.  
随后，真嗣用尽全力猛拉她的双腿。

In a whirlwind of bronze hair and flapping towels and screams and yelps and delighted grunts, Asuka landed ass-first on Shinji's lap. It was a pretty rough landing, but she barely felt any pain because the whole thing was too funny and she was laughing hysterically. Somehow, the next moment, they found themselves all tangled up together, her hands on his shoulders and his hands on her thighs. The pressure from below made Asuka smile wryly.  
在一阵铜色发丝飞扬、毛巾翻飞、尖叫与欢呼声中，明日香屁股着地摔在了真嗣的腿上。虽然着陆相当粗暴，但她几乎没感到疼痛，因为整个过程太滑稽了，她笑得前仰后合。转眼间，他们发现自己纠缠在一起，她的手搭在他的肩上，他的手放在她的大腿上。下方的压力让明日香苦笑了一下。

"I didn't break anything this time, did I?"  
"这次我没弄坏什么吧，是不是？"

Shinji chuckled. "No. You didn't."  
真嗣轻声笑了。"没有。你没弄坏。"

Asuka leaned down and rested her head on Shinji's shoulder. His hands came up and tried to pull up the towel that had been dislodged in the mess. Asuka opened her mouth to tell him to just leave it alone, but opted to sigh instead. He gave up after several failed attempts.  
明日香俯身将头靠在真嗣的肩上。他的手抬起，试图拉起在混乱中滑落的毛巾。明日香张嘴想让他别管了，但最终只是叹了口气。几次尝试失败后，他放弃了。

His smell reminded her that he hadn't taken a shower after coming home yet, but she didn't mind that either. Asuka rubbed her forehead against his shoulder.  
他的气味提醒她，他回家后还没洗过澡，但她对此也不介意。明日香将额头抵在他的肩上。

As she did, Asuka realized once again how much she liked this. How good it felt to laugh and hold each other like this. To be open like this. How much she didn't want to lose this. But then again, it was Shinji who was opening up to her, not the other way around. She didn't really open up to him the way he did to her today. She didn't know if it was her consciously avoiding it, or if it was just how the conversation had gone.  
就在这时，明日香再次意识到她有多喜欢这样。像这样一起笑、互相拥抱的感觉有多好。像这样敞开心扉的感觉。她有多么不想失去这一切。但话说回来，是真嗣在向她敞开心扉，而不是反过来。她并没有像他今天对她那样对他敞开心扉。她不知道这是否是她有意回避，还是对话自然而然地发展成这样。

And Asuka was vaguely aware that this couldn't continue. They needed to talk. They needed to understand why the other was acting the way they did before they got into another fight again. And Asuka knew that her contribution to the recent tribulations had been greater than Shinji's, and that it was her turn to open up.  
而明日香隐约意识到这不能继续下去。他们需要谈谈。他们需要理解对方为何会有这样的行为，以免再次陷入争吵。明日香知道，最近这些风波中她的责任比真嗣更大，现在是她该敞开心扉的时候了。

But how? The voices in her mind that would normally be protesting loudly were silent now, but even without such distractions, Asuka was at a loss. How was she supposed to explain to Shinji what piloting the Evangelion meant to her? Why the synchronization rate was so important?  
但该怎么做呢？她脑海中通常会大声抗议的声音此刻却沉默了，但即便没有这些干扰，明日香也感到茫然。她该如何向真嗣解释驾驶 EVA 对她意味着什么？为什么同步率如此重要？

As her thoughts reached that point, Asuka realized something else; that Shinji had already given her a hint on this matter, a road sign she could follow.  
当她的思绪到达这一点时，明日香意识到另一件事；真嗣已经在这件事上给了她一个暗示，一个她可以跟随的路标。

Asuka lifted her head. The sudden movement brought a questioning glance from Shinji. Looking into those soft blue eyes, Asuka steeled her resolve. She tried to start from where Shinji had left things off the last time.  
明日香抬起头。这个突然的动作引来了真嗣疑惑的目光。凝视着那双柔和的蓝眼睛，明日香坚定了决心。她试图从上次真嗣停下的地方开始。

"Shinji. You told me back then. That you're piloting the Evangelion and staying in this city all because of me. That you're only doing it for me."  
“真嗣。你那时告诉我。你驾驶 EVA 并留在这个城市，全都是因为我。你这么做只是为了我。”

Shinji didn't react for about two or three breaths. Asuka had to stifle a bitter smile as something akin to wariness surfaced in his eyes.  
真嗣大约有两三息的时间没有任何反应。明日香不得不忍住一个苦笑，因为他眼中浮现出类似戒备的神情。

_I gave him some good reasons to feel like that, I guess.  
我想，我给了他一些充分的理由去那样感觉。_

Asuka forced the softest smile she could muster, and opened her uncooperative mouth.  
明日香竭尽全力挤出了一个最温柔的微笑，然后张开了她那不听使唤的嘴。

"I..." “我……”

_I what?_ Asuka's throat quivered. Once again, hesitation gripped her whole body and wouldn't let go. What was she supposed to say? What could she tell him? Would he even understand if she did? Wouldn't he try to argue or something? Wouldn't this just end up being a gigantic mistake, which would lead to them having another stupid fight?  
我什么？明日香的喉咙颤抖着。又一次，犹豫紧紧抓住了她的全身，不肯放手。她该说什么？她能告诉他什么？即使她说了，他会理解吗？他不会试图争辩或什么的吗？这不又会变成一个巨大的错误，导致他们再次陷入愚蠢的争吵吗？

Or rather, did she even want to hear the reason with her own voice?  
倒不如说，她真的想用自己的耳朵去听那个理由吗？

That she's doing this because her mother-  
她这么做是因为她的母亲——

Asuka chewed her lip. She saw Shinji's eyes fluttering. As if pushed by the sight, Asuka cautiously opened her mouth.  
明日香咬着嘴唇。她看到真嗣的眼皮微微颤动。仿佛被这一幕所驱使，明日香小心翼翼地张开了嘴。

"I like you, Shinji. A lot. Really."  
"我喜欢你，真嗣。非常喜欢。真的。"

The quickly blossoming guilt, the guilt that she hadn't said what she meant to say, that she said the wrong thing, even though it was truth on its own, and that this could be a deception of a sort, was instantly washed away by the sight of Shinji's beaming face. Tears rapidly pooled in his eyes. His hands, lingering near Asuka's waist, came up and took hold of her, and he fell into her arms. Asuka buried her fingers in his hair and gently pulled him closer. His whole body trembled in her arms.  
那迅速滋生的内疚，她没有说出本想说的话，说了不该说的话，尽管那也是事实，但这可能是一种欺骗，这一切在她看到真嗣灿烂的笑脸时瞬间消散。泪水迅速在他的眼眶中汇聚。他的手，停留在明日香腰间，抬起并紧紧抓住她，他倒进她的怀抱。明日香将手指埋入他的发间，温柔地拉近他。他的整个身体在她怀中颤抖。

She made him happy. That should be enough.  
她让他感到快乐。这应该足够了。

At least, that's what Asuka wanted to think.  
至少，这是明日香想要相信的。

Getting to the base in the morning was no easy task, especially when he wasn't being given a ride.  
早上到达基地绝非易事，尤其是当他没有搭车的时候。

It wouldn't have been that hard if he rode with his father, but Kensuke gave up that solution from the get-go. Their relationship, which had always been distant, had been all but destroyed by the chain of events that brought them to the United States. These days they didn't talk much. Even the big news of Kensuke's designation as a pilot did not cause much reaction from the old man. It was impossible for him to walk up to his father and say, 'I've heard rumors of an important experiment today, so I'd like to skip school and go to the base. Please give me a ride?'  
如果他能和父亲一起乘车，事情就不会那么困难，但健介从一开始就放弃了那个方案。他们之间本就疏远的关系，在将他们带到美国的这一连串事件中几乎被摧毁殆尽。如今他们很少交谈。即便是健介被指定为驾驶员这样的重大消息，也未能引起老头的多大反应。他怎么可能走到父亲面前说：‘我听说今天有个重要的实验，所以我想逃学去基地。请给我搭个车吧？’

NERV headquarters in Tokyo-3 was connected to the city proper by a designated train line. The small town in central Nevada where Kensuke found himself had no such infrastructure. It was extremely difficult to get to the nearest supermarket without a car, let alone all the way to the NERV base located in the nearby desert. It wasn't like a school where they provided a bus, either, so Kensuke ended up calling a cab with his broken English.  
东京-3 的 NERV 总部与市区通过一条专用铁路线相连。而身处内华达州中部小镇的 Kensuke 却无此便利。没有汽车，要到达最近的超市都极为困难，更不用说前往位于附近沙漠中的 NERV 基地了。这里也不像学校那样有校车接送，因此 Kensuke 只好用他那蹩脚的英语叫了一辆出租车。

Arriving at the base wasn't the end of the ordeal; it was easy enough to get through the various manned and unmanned checkpoints with the NERV ID he was given (he still felt almost euphoric whenever he had the chance to use it), but the real challenge was actually navigating the place. The underground facility here was needlessly huge and complex in Kensuke's opinion. So many empty corridors and horizontal escalators that led to nowhere. He'd only ever been here with an escort, which was somehow able to navigate this maze with flawless precision every time. He always wondered if this was a reflection of American sensibilities; to him, this country had more land than sense, which led to lots of wasted space when it came to city planning and building design. He figured the Japanese headquarters in Tokyo-3 were more rationally and efficiently planned, like a proper Japanese establishment. Then again, he'd never set foot in there.  
抵达基地并非磨难的终点；凭借 NERV 发放的身份识别卡（每次有机会使用时，他几乎都感到一种莫名的兴奋），穿越那些有人值守和无人值守的检查站并不困难，真正的挑战在于如何在这地方找到方向。在健介看来，这座地下设施大得毫无必要，结构又异常复杂。无数空荡荡的走廊和通往不知何处的水平电梯。他之前每次来这里都有人陪同，那些陪同者总能在这迷宫中精准无误地导航。他常想这是否反映了美国人的思维方式；对他而言，这个国家土地辽阔却缺乏合理规划，导致城市规划和建筑设计中存在大量空间浪费。他猜想日本的总部——东京-3 的布局应该更为合理高效，更像一个典型的日本机构。不过话说回来，他从未踏足过那里。

Anyway, Kensuke had at last managed to find the pilot lounge, where he now sat, alone, intently watching the TV that was connected to the test hangar. The video feed came courtesy of Lieutenant Yoshida. He would have preferred to be in the testing room, but since he wasn't allowed in there, a video feed was good enough.  
无论如何，健介终于找到了飞行员休息室，此刻他独自坐在那里，全神贯注地盯着连接到测试机库的电视。视频信号来自吉田中尉。他本想亲自进入测试室，但既然不被允许，视频直播也足够了。

He was in the middle of trying to parse the technobabble being fired off in rapid English when the door whooshed open. He glanced back, startled. Fletcher was the only other person in his unit, and he was the one who got to be in the testing room. Kensuke wasn't expecting company.  
他正努力理解着快速喷涌而出的技术术语时，门突然呼啸着打开了。他惊讶地回头，弗莱彻是他的单位里唯一另一个人，而他正是那个能进入测试室的人。健介没想到会有访客。

But soon he realized he was wrong. There had been a transfer, recently, though he hadn't had a chance to talk with her yet.  
但很快他意识到自己错了。最近确实有人员调动，尽管他还没机会和她交谈。

The newcomer probably didn't expect Kensuke to be here either, because she paused at the doorway for a moment. Brown haired and blue eyed, she looked to be in that awkward in-between stage of being a little too young to be called a woman, but a little too old to be called a girl. Maybe it was just Kensuke being bad at judging white people's ages, but she definitely looked older than him. Older than a certain white girl he'd met back in Japan, and older than the kids he saw at his new school.  
这位新来者大概也没料到会在这里见到健介，因为她站在门口停顿了一会儿。棕色头发，蓝色眼睛，她似乎正处于那种尴尬的过渡期，既不太年轻被称为女人，也不太年长被称为女孩。或许是健介不擅长判断白人的年龄，但她看起来确实比他大。比他在日本遇到的那位白人女孩大，也比他在新学校见到的孩子们大。

And judging age wasn't the only thing Kensuke was bad at. He couldn't figure out what to say in this situation. He had never been comfortable around girls, much less when he had to speak to them in a foreign language. He was the only student in his school's ESL program, and he wasn't sure if he had learned anything from it. It was the girl-woman who broke the awkward moment with a short, casual 'hey'.  
而判断年龄并不是健介唯一不擅长的。他不知道在这种情况下该说什么。他从未在女孩面前感到自在，更不用说用外语与她们交谈了。他是学校 ESL 项目中唯一的学生，不确定自己是否从中学到了什么。正是这位女孩打破了尴尬的沉默，随意地说了声“嘿”。

With that, she stepped into the room and plopped down on the couch across from him.  
说完，她走进房间，一屁股坐在他对面的沙发上。

For a moment, Kensuke wondered if that was a greeting of some sort. It was just a single syllable. Then he remembered there was actually a similar expression in Japanese, too. Kensuke forced a smile. "Hey."  
有那么一刻，健介怀疑这是某种问候语。它只是一个单音节词。随即他想起来，日语中其实也有类似的表达。健介勉强挤出一个微笑。“嘿。”

His fellow pilot turned to the TV with an odd look on her face. When she opened her mouth again, Kensuke was utterly shocked. "Here to watch the experiment?" she asked.  
他的同伴飞行员带着奇怪的表情转向电视。当她再次开口时，健介完全震惊了。“来看实验的吗？”她问道。

Both the accent and intonation were strange, to say the least, but it was definitely Japanese. After the initial shock wore off, Kensuke was almost pleased, the beginnings of a smile making their appearance. Other than Lieutenant Yoshida, he had no one to talk to in Japanese these days, and that meant he barely talked at all.  
至少可以说，口音和语调都很奇怪，但那绝对是日语。最初的震惊过去后，健介几乎感到高兴，一丝微笑开始浮现。除了吉田中尉，他这些天没有其他人可以讲日语，这意味着他几乎不怎么说话。

"Oh, yeah, I heard there's some major renovation work on Unit-04 today. I wasn't called in, so it's none of my concern, I guess. Maybe it's a security clearance thing? Although I don't understand why they didn't tell me anything about this; I am a pilot after all... anyway, Lieutenant Yoshida set this up for me after I arrived at the hangar so I could watch it from here."  
"哦，是的，我听说今天 04 号单元有大型的翻新工作。我没被叫去，所以应该不关我的事吧。可能是安全许可的问题？虽然我不明白为什么他们没告诉我任何信息；毕竟我是个驾驶员...不管怎样，我到达机库后，吉田中尉为我安排了这里的位置，这样我就可以从这里观看了。"

Kensuke realized the girl was looking at him with an amused expression. Heat rose to his face. Maybe he was just too excited to meet someone who could speak Japanese after so long.  
健介意识到女孩正带着有趣的表情看着他。他的脸颊开始发热。也许他只是太兴奋了，终于遇到了一个能说日语的人，已经很久没有过了。

"I'm sorry." "对不起。"

The girl was still silent. Kensuke couldn't stand the awkwardness so he spoke again. "Um, Ms. Hunt, right? I'm Kensuke. Aida Kensuke. No, I mean, Kensuke Aida. Kensuke is the given name and Aida is the surname. We have it the other way around, you see."  
女孩依旧沉默。健介受不了这尴尬的气氛，于是再次开口：“呃，亨特小姐，对吧？我是健介。相田健介。不，我是说，相田健介。健介是名字，相田是姓氏。我们的顺序反了，你懂的。”

She snorted. "RM. Call me RM. No honorifics. There's too many of them and it's annoying to keep track. And slow down."  
她哼了一声。“RM。叫我 RM 就行。不用敬语。太多了，记不住，还烦人。还有，慢点说。”

Kensuke chuckled, thinking it was a strange name. Come to think of it, he couldn't remember her first name at all. Maybe RM was an abbreviation, but it didn't matter. If she wanted to be called that, then whatever. He slowed his speech a little more consciously this time, pausing between each word.  
健介轻笑，觉得这名字挺奇怪的。话说回来，他完全不记得她的全名了。也许 RM 是缩写，但无所谓。如果她想这么被称呼，那就随她吧。这次他更加自觉地放慢了语速，每个字之间都稍作停顿。

"Okay. Uhm, still, your Japanese is good. I'm a little surprised. You're the first one I've met who speaks it, besides Lieutenant Yoshida."  
"好吧。呃，不过，你的日语真不错。我有点惊讶。除了吉田中尉，你是第一个我遇到的会说日语的人。"

"Yoshida. Tech department. Short hair?"  
"吉田。技术部门的。短发？"

Kensuke nodded. "Yeah. He's Japanese-American. I'm a pain in his butt, I guess."  
健介点点头。“是的。他是日裔美国人。我想我给他添了不少麻烦。”

"Pain?" "痛吗？"

"I mean, I'm getting a lot of help from him."  
"我是说，他给了我很多帮助。"

"Ah."

"But you, how do you speak Japanese so well, are you mixed race too?"  
"但你，你怎么日语说得这么好，你也是混血儿吗？"

RM let out a short laugh. It sounded cheerful, but there was a harsh undertone to it that sent chills down Kensuke's spine. But maybe he was imagining things. She shook her head.  
RM 轻笑一声。听起来很愉快，但其中隐含的尖锐却让健介背脊发凉。或许只是他多心了。她摇了摇头。

"What the hell. No. When I was selected, I trained at the London HQ. They taught me Japanese there. Most of the active-duty pilot corp is Japanese, right? Including that ace? I'm surprised they're not teaching them English over there, or us Japanese over here. How about Fletcher? Does he speak Japanese? How are all of us supposed to communicate if he can't?"  
“搞什么鬼。不。我被选中后，在伦敦总部接受训练。他们在那里教我日语。大部分现役飞行员不都是日本人吗？包括那位王牌？我倒惊讶他们没在那边教英语，或者我们这边没学日语。弗莱彻呢？他会说日语吗？如果他不会，我们怎么沟通？”

"Ah, well…" “啊，这个嘛……”

Kensuke felt a lump in his throat. He had a feeling he knew who she was referring to when she said the Japanese ace. Kensuke hoped that the conversation wouldn't go in that direction. He'd rather talk about his other fellow pilot, Fletcher, although he knew next to nothing about him either.  
健介感到喉咙哽咽。他有种预感，当她提到那位日本王牌时，她指的是谁。健介希望对话不要朝那个方向发展。他宁愿谈谈他的另一位飞行员同伴弗莱彻，尽管他对弗莱彻也几乎一无所知。

"I hear you're from the Japanese headquarters. How are the pilots there? Did you know them well?"  
“听说你来自日本总部。那里的飞行员怎么样？你和他们很熟吗？”

Kensuke narrowed his eyes.  
健介眯起了眼睛。

Ayanami. Soryu. Girls he didn't know very well from the beginning.  
绫波。惣流。那些从一开始就不甚了解的女孩们。

Shinji. A boy he thought he knew, but actually didn't.  
真嗣。一个他以为自己了解，实则不然的男孩。

All of them were special. The chosen ones. Shining. The ones who had it so good, who had unimaginable privileges, who didn't even seem to realize it.  
他们全都与众不同。被选中的那些人。闪耀着光芒。拥有难以想象的特权，却似乎对此浑然不觉。

Kensuke shook his head. "Not really. We weren't that close."  
健介摇了摇头。“不算太熟。我们没那么亲近。”

He looked away from those blue eyes, clear and almost colorless, like the flat blank gray of the sky on a cold winter's day. There was something sharp and almost predatory in those eyes that pinned him in place and made some deep, primal part of him shift uneasily. It was only when her attention shifted back to the TV that Kensuke realized that he had been holding his breath. The next question, however, didn't quell the feeling of unease.  
他避开那双清澈近乎无色的蓝眼睛，它们如同寒冷冬日里灰蒙蒙的天空般平淡无奇。那双眼睛里有着某种锐利且近乎掠食性的光芒，将他牢牢钉在原地，令他内心深处原始的部分不安地躁动。直到她的注意力重新回到电视上，健介才意识到自己一直屏着呼吸。然而，下一个问题并未减轻这种不安感。

"Who did that to your face? Those eye scars. The nose. Don't tell me it was from a fall. I know the marks of a fight when I see them."  
“谁把你打成这样的？那些眼角的伤痕，还有鼻子。别告诉我这是摔的。我一看就知道是打架留下的痕迹。”

The bridge of his nose throbbed, just like whenever he recalled the event. Kensuke laughed awkwardly and swiped at his face with one hand. "It's just…"  
他的鼻梁隐隐作痛，每当回想起那件事时总是如此。健介尴尬地笑了笑，用一只手抹了抹脸。“只是……”

He hesitated for a moment. Words were not coming easily to him. How was he supposed to explain this?  
他犹豫了一会儿。言语对他来说并不容易。他该如何解释这一切呢？

All the bitterness. The injustice. The anger.  
所有的苦涩。不公。愤怒。

He turned his gaze to the TV. The screen remained unchanged from earlier. Unit-04 was standing in the hangar, still in its restraints. Fletcher must be in there right now.  
他转向电视。屏幕与之前无异，四号机仍被固定在机库中。弗莱彻此刻必定就在里面。

Kensuke shook his head curtly.  
健介简短地摇了摇头。

"It's nothing serious. I was stupid, that's all."  
“没什么大不了的，只是我犯傻了。”

RM didn't answer, and Kensuke could feel her gaze return to him, but he forced himself to ignore it and kept his eyes on the TV. Aside from the occasional flickering of the lights and the constant stream of busy conversations that were too fast for Kensuke to understand, the screen seemed almost like a still image.  
RM 没有回答，Kensuke 能感觉到她的目光再次回到他身上，但他强迫自己忽略这一点，继续盯着电视。除了偶尔的灯光闪烁和 Kensuke 无法理解的一连串快速对话外，屏幕看起来几乎像是一幅静止的画面。

"So, how did you pay them back? Did you kill them?"  
“那么，你是怎么报复他们的？杀了他们吗？”

For a moment Kensuke thought he'd heard wrong, or that she'd just used the wrong Japanese word. But when he turned to look at RM's face, it was deadly serious. He smiled awkwardly.  
有那么一刻，Kensuke 以为自己听错了，或者她只是用了错误的日语词汇。但当他转头看向 RM 的脸时，她的表情异常严肃。他尴尬地笑了笑。

"Oh, no. Like I said, it was just me being stupid-"  
“哦，不。就像我说的，只是我犯傻了——”

RM hummed thoughtfully and then began to unzip her sweatshirt. As Kensuke watched, bewildered, she exposed her bare shoulder. The first thing that caught Kensuke's eye was a bra strap. He thought he'd become quite used to such a thing already, but it was different when the girl was so close and there was no camera to hide behind.  
RM 若有所思地哼了一声，然后开始拉开她的运动衫拉链。当健介困惑地看着时，她露出了裸露的肩膀。首先吸引健介目光的是一条胸罩带。他本以为自己已经对这种事情习以为常了，但当女孩如此靠近，而且没有摄像机遮挡时，感觉完全不同。

And then RM pointed somewhere. It was a spot between her shoulder and armpit. There was an ugly scar there, as if the flesh had been grabbed with hot tongs and twisted this way and that.  
接着，RM 指向某个地方。那是她肩膀和腋下之间的一个位置。那里有一道丑陋的疤痕，仿佛是用滚烫的钳子抓住肉，来回扭动留下的痕迹。

"Look. Here. I was stupid, too. How am I supposed to say this in Japanese? Whatever. A provo shot me. Was hiding. Went clean through."  
“看，这里。我也曾愚蠢过。我该怎么用日语说这个？无所谓了。一个恐怖分子开枪打中了我。我在躲藏。子弹穿透了身体。”

Kensuke gasped. "Are you telling me you were shot? By a real gun?!"  
健助倒吸一口凉气。“你是说你中枪了？被真枪打中的？！”

RM nodded. RM 点了点头。

"We found him the next week. At his house. Along with his family."  
"我们是在下一周找到他的。在他家里。和他的家人一起。"

Kensuke let out a noise of surprise. "Wow, you fought in a war or something? That's amazing! Where did you fight? What was the gauge of the gun that shot you? Did you keep the bullet? I'd definitely do that if I ever got shot! Wait, you're from England, right? What branch did you serve in?"  
健介发出一声惊呼。“哇，你参加过战争之类的吗？太厉害了！你在哪里作战？射中你的枪口径是多少？你保留了那颗子弹吗？如果我被射中，我肯定会保留的！等等，你是英国人，对吧？你在哪个部队服役？”

Only after shooting off all those questions did Kensuke remember that his fellow pilot was only a few years older than him at best. Whatever had happened, he doubted that she had fought as a regular soldier. It was probably one of the many small conflicts that had erupted in the aftermath of Second Impact, and his mental nerd encyclopedia of war and gunneries quickly suggested several possible scenarios. And none of it sounded particularly pleasant. He cringed a bit, realizing that he probably offended her greatly. He was considering an apology when RM shrugged and zipped up her sweatshirt again.  
在抛出所有这些问题之后，健介才想起他的同伴飞行员最多只比他大几岁。无论发生了什么，他怀疑她并没有作为正规士兵参战。这很可能是第二次冲击后爆发的众多小冲突之一，而他脑海中的战争和枪械百科全书迅速提出了几种可能的情景。而这些听起来都不太愉快。他有些畏缩，意识到自己可能大大冒犯了对方。正当他考虑道歉时，RM 耸了耸肩，再次拉上了她的运动衫拉链。

"It was nothing official."  
"这并非正式的事情。"

Kensuke didn't know what to say, so he turned his attention back to the TV. Nothing had changed on the screen. He felt RM's gaze on him again.  
健介不知道该说什么，于是又将注意力转回到电视上。屏幕上的内容丝毫未变。他再次感觉到 RM 的目光落在他身上。

"How about your Unit?" "你的单位怎么样？"

This was a topic he could welcome. Kensuke had to suppress the urge to smirk. It was the first time he'd had a real chance to brag about this. It wasn't like he could with Fletcher, since that guy had been a pilot longer than he had.  
这个话题他倒是乐于接受。健介不得不压下嘴角的笑意。这还是他第一次有机会真正炫耀一番。毕竟没法跟弗莱彻比，那家伙当飞行员的时间比他还长。

"Unit-05 isn't finished yet. I haven't even gone inside it once, to be honest. It's not a minor issue like paint color or anything either, though that's important to me too. They have to ship some crucial part from Japan and that hasn't arrived yet, they say. And even with that done, they'd have to renovate it the same way they renovated Fletcher's Unit-04, so I'll have to wait quite a while before my unit is operational. I've done a lot of simulation training in the meantime, but they say that since the material is mostly based on Unit-01's records, it won't be as effective a learning resource after the refurbishment is over. They never explained why, though..."  
五号机还没完工呢。老实说，我连一次都没进去过。这可不是什么小问题，比如涂装颜色之类的，虽然那对我也很重要。他们说，得从日本运来一个关键部件，但还没到。即便到了，还得像翻新弗莱彻的四号机那样翻新它，所以我得等上好一阵子才能让我的机体投入使用。这段时间我做了很多模拟训练，但他们说，由于资料大多基于初号机的记录，翻新结束后，这些资料作为学习资源的效果就没那么好了。不过，他们从没解释过为什么...

Kensuke wondered if he had said too much again. Such a suspicion was reinforced when he realized that RM's gaze had shifted away from him and was now on the TV. Slightly disheartened, he checked the TV screen to see if anything had happened. Nothing had changed on the screen itself, except that the voices coming out of the speakers were slightly faster and more excited than before. Kensuke scratched the back of his head.  
健介怀疑自己是不是又说得太多。当他注意到 RM 的目光从他身上移开，转向电视时，这种怀疑得到了加强。他略感沮丧，检查了一下电视屏幕，看看是否发生了什么。屏幕本身并没有变化，只是从扬声器传出的声音比之前更快、更兴奋。健介挠了挠后脑勺。

"Uhm, did something happen? Can you interpret what they're saying over the comm?"  
“呃，发生什么事了吗？你能解读他们在通讯里说什么吗？”

RM shrugged and stood up. Her words were thickly accented.  
RM 耸了耸肩，站起身来。她的口音很重。

"Evangelion Unit-04, Super Solenoid Engine operation successful."  
"福音战士 04 号机，超级螺线管引擎启动成功。"

### Chapter 20 Insufficiency

The footsteps were, as befitted their owner's occupation, light and quiet as always. Such careful walking was so ingrained in his actions that it was no longer done consciously. But it seemed the combination of rusted iron flooring and casual loafers made his habit irrelevant, and his steps echoed loudly and confidently through the abandoned factory. Anyone in the vicinity would be able to recognize his presence.  
脚步声一如既往地轻盈而悄无声息，这正符合他职业的特性。如此小心翼翼的行走已成为他行动中根深蒂固的一部分，以至于不再需要有意识地去执行。然而，生锈的铁质地板与随意穿着的休闲鞋似乎让他的习惯变得无关紧要，他的脚步声在废弃的工厂中回荡，响亮而自信。任何附近的人都能轻易察觉到他的存在。

But he didn't mind it much. He wouldn't have come here if he wasn't sure this was reasonably safe. As unlikely as it was to happen at this point, if some organization somewhere - and there were _many_ candidates- wanted to jump him, there were far better places than this. The abandoned industrial park on the outskirts of downtown Kyoto wasn't exactly a bustling area, but it wasn't the kind of place where murders happened in broad daylight either.  
但他对此并不太介意。如果不是确信这里相对安全，他也不会来这儿。尽管此时发生的可能性微乎其微，但如果某个组织——候选者众多——想要伏击他，有比这里更合适的地方。京都市中心边缘的废弃工业园区虽不热闹，但也绝非光天化日之下发生命案的场所。

Of course, it was completely possible for something like that to happen anyway, just as possible as it would be anywhere else. He wouldn't be able to do his job at all if he worried too much about such low-level risks. His chances of getting gunned down right this second were probably comparable to those of dying while merging onto the highway.  
当然，类似的事情完全有可能发生，就像在其他任何地方一样。如果他过分担心这些低级风险，就根本无法完成工作。此刻被枪击的概率，大概与高速公路上并线时发生意外死亡的几率相当。

So, if anything was holding him back now, it wasn't fear or anxiety. It was the strange sense of deja vu and the discomfort that accompanied it.  
因此，现在阻碍他的并非恐惧或焦虑，而是那种奇怪的既视感及其伴随的不适。

He stopped walking and looked around. Flecks of dust floated in the lazy afternoon sunlight that leaked in through the smudged windows and the holes in the slate-paneled walls. Looking down, he found the floor was dotted with marks where lathes and milling machines must have once stood. The stains, lighter in color than the surrounding floor, were the only evidence of what had once occupied the space. It felt like seeing an abandoned campsite that well-trained troops left in an orderly fashion. It felt like a dark mirror of Japan's much-vaunted _revival_, like a wound that had been cleared but not fully healed. Neat and tidy, yet somehow sad and lonely.  
他停下脚步，环顾四周。斑驳的尘埃在慵懒的午后阳光中飘浮，阳光透过沾满污迹的窗户和石板墙上的孔洞洒进来。低头一看，地板上布满了曾经放置车床和铣床的痕迹。这些污渍比周围的地板颜色更浅，是这片空间曾经被占据的唯一证据。这感觉就像看到一个被训练有素的部队井然有序地遗弃的露营地。它像是日本引以为傲的复兴的一个阴暗镜像，像一个已被清理但未完全愈合的伤口。整洁有序，却又莫名地悲伤和孤独。

But Ryoji Kaji could easily imagine what this place must have looked like before it was cleared and organized into the tidy ruin in which he now stood. If he focused enough, he might even smell it. The acrid smoke of haphazardly gathered fuels burning in a poorly ventilated area, with a base of rusted iron, mixed with the stench of cigarettes and unwashed bodies.  
但碇源堂可以轻易想象出这个地方在被清理和整理成如今这般井然有序的废墟之前的样子。如果他足够专注，甚至可能闻到那股味道。刺鼻的烟雾来自通风不良区域随意聚集的燃料燃烧，混合着生锈的铁味，夹杂着香烟和不洗澡的身体的臭味。

Well, he had no way of knowing if such things actually happened here specifically, but it wouldn't surprise him if they had. Abandoned industrial complexes like this had served as a refuge for those who had nowhere else to go back then. Groups of misplaced teenagers would wash up along with other flotsam and jetsam, casualties of wars and bombs slipping through the cracks of a nation struggling to pull itself back together.  
好吧，他无法确定这种事情是否真的在这里发生过，但如果确实如此，他也不会感到惊讶。像这样的废弃工业综合体，在当时曾是那些无处可去之人的避难所。一群群迷失的青少年与其他漂流物一起涌入，成为战争和炸弹的受害者，他们从挣扎着重新站起来的国家的裂缝中滑落。

He looked at the stains, and wondered what became of the machines that made them. Had they been carted off by their rightful owners? Or maybe they'd been removed another way.  
他看着那些污渍，想知道制造它们的机器后来怎样了。是被它们合法的主人运走了吗？或者它们以另一种方式被移除了。

In the chaos of the post-Impact years, most ordinary people struggled to keep their heads above water. But there were those who found opportunity, who became rich through questionable processes. The so-called Impact Riches. Who took full advantage of the absence of a coherent government to gain wealth and power through all kinds of methods, most of which were questionably legal at best. Real estate and inheritance were the most common, but selling stolen factory equipment was an option too, in Kaji's opinion.  
在撞击事件后的混乱年代，大多数普通人都在努力维持生计。但也有一些人发现了机会，通过可疑的过程变得富有。所谓的撞击富豪。他们充分利用了政府缺位的时机，通过各种手段获取财富和权力，这些手段大多在法律边缘徘徊。房地产和遗产是最常见的，但在加持看来，贩卖被盗工厂设备也是一个选项。

Of course, it was one thing to know that there were people out there willing to buy, but it was another thing entirely to actually find such people and contact them. These days, such a task would be more of a nuisance than an impossibility for him, but back then he was just another snot-nosed kid, freshly orphaned. A pitiful creature barely older than NERV's current crop of Eva pilots, lucky to have something to eat every other day and doing whatever the 'brothers' ordered him to do.  
当然，知道有人愿意购买是一回事，但真正找到这些人并联系他们则是另一回事。如今，这项任务对他来说更多的是麻烦而非不可能，但那时他不过是个刚成孤儿的鼻涕虫小孩。一个可怜的小家伙，年纪比 NERV 现在的 Eva 驾驶员们大不了多少，幸运的话每隔一天能吃上一顿饭，还得听命于那些“兄弟”的吩咐。

Well, little Kaji aside, it wasn't like those brothers, older kids who led the group, were any better. The benevolent tyrants who ruled with an iron fist, smoked cigarettes, monopolized the few girls, and were unafraid to use violence even against adults had been objects of fear and awe to little Kaji. In hindsight, it was painfully clear to him that they were just boys who didn't know any better. All they were good at was snatching, stealing, and occasionally beating the crap out of those they thought deserved it. They relied mostly on their numbers and ruthlessness, sometimes dragging unfortunate women off to the dark corners of the labyrinth that was the abandoned industrial complex while little boys like Ryoji looked out for them. No wonder they were annihilated so easily when they messed with a group full of more serious and desperate adults.  
好吧，小 Kaji 暂且不论，那些领头的哥哥们也没好到哪儿去。这些仁慈的暴君用铁腕统治，抽着烟，垄断了仅有的几个女孩，甚至对成年人也不惧使用暴力，一直是小 Kaji 心中既畏惧又敬畏的对象。现在回想起来，他痛苦地明白他们不过是些不懂事的男孩。他们擅长的无非是抢夺、偷窃，偶尔还会对自认为该受罚的人拳打脚踢。他们主要依靠人数和无情，有时会把不幸的女性拖到废弃工业区迷宫般的黑暗角落，而像亮司这样的小男孩则为他们望风。难怪他们招惹了一群更严肃、更绝望的成年人后，会如此轻易地被消灭。

Kaji let out a small sigh and started again, soon reaching the door opposite the one he had come in through. He could feel someone's presence through the crack in the door. He pulled the pistol from its holster on his shoulder and flipped the safety. The clicking sound echoed loudly in the quiet factory.  
Kaji 轻轻叹了口气，重新开始行动，不久便来到了与他进入时相对的另一扇门前。他能感觉到门缝中透出的某人气息。他从肩上的枪套中抽出手枪，打开了保险。咔嗒声在寂静的工厂中回响。

"It's me." “是我。”

Kaji snorted at the familiar tone, flipped the safety back, and holstered the gun. Soon a thin book appeared through the slightly opened doorway. He bent down, lifted and opened it. A piece of paper, folded in half, lay in the center of the book.  
加治对这熟悉的语调嗤之以鼻，重新打开保险，将枪插回枪套。很快，一本薄薄的书从微微开启的门缝中出现。他弯下腰，拿起并翻开书页。一张对折的纸片静静躺在书中央。

A low voice spoke over the sound of unfolding paper. "This is the 107th one. And it's, well, as you can see. Total shell."  
低沉的声音在展开纸张的沙沙声中响起。“这是第 107 个了。而且，嗯，如你所见，完全是个空壳。”

"Hmm." "嗯。"

Kaji almost laughed at the familiar names on the paper. Things would've been much more complicated if they troubled themselves enough to use fake identities from time to time for these shell companies. Considering their power and the administrational void that followed the Impact, laundering identities wouldn't have been difficult. One might even call this a sign of hubris. But then again, maybe their confidence wasn't unfounded. They controlled everything, after all.  
加治几乎要笑出声来，那些熟悉的名字赫然纸上。如果他们能时不时地费心使用假身份来经营这些空壳公司，事情可能会复杂得多。考虑到他们的权力以及冲击后留下的行政空白，洗白身份本不应是难事。这或许可以称之为傲慢的标志。但话说回来，也许他们的自信并非毫无根据。毕竟，他们掌控着一切。

As he folded the paper and put it back in its original place, he noticed the back pages of the book also had an awkwardly lifted feel to them. Flipping a few pages over, he found a note tucked into the folds, not unlike the first one. He pulled it out and began to read. It was something completely unexpected, but he couldn't stop the corner of his mouth from lifting up.  
当他将纸张折叠好放回原位时，注意到书的背面几页也有种不自然的凸起感。翻过几页，他发现一张纸条夹在折缝中，与第一张颇为相似。他抽出纸条开始阅读。内容完全出乎意料，但他无法抑制嘴角的上扬。

Even from the other side of the door, where they couldn't see his face, they must have read his mood. The voice exhaled a laugh.  
即便隔着门，他们看不见他的表情，也一定能感受到他的情绪。那声音带着笑意呼出。

"It's something I caught on to while digging around on this whole pilot selection business. Thought you might be interested."  
“这是我在调查这次飞行员选拔过程中无意间发现的。我想你可能会感兴趣。”

"Thanks, but this sounds like something I could have figured out on my own. And through the official way. I probably would've been notified of this soon enough."  
"谢谢，但这听起来像是靠我自己也能想明白的事。而且通过官方途径。我大概很快也会收到通知。"

"If the Irish were to try and publicize this through the UN, yes. But as things stand now, it's unlikely."  
"如果爱尔兰人试图通过联合国公开此事，是的。但就目前情况来看，不太可能。"

Kaji cleared his throat. "Maybe. No, you're probably right. I'm more surprised it's only now becoming an issue."  
加持清了清嗓子。 "也许吧。不，你大概是对的。我只是更惊讶这事现在才成为问题。"

"Pilot identity is confidential. The leak must have happened very recently with the transfer."  
"飞行员的身份保密。泄露肯定是在最近转移时发生的。"

Kaji glanced at the document in his hand one last time to memorize its contents, then folded it, slipped it back into the book, and held it out through the door again. A small hand appeared and took it.  
加治再次瞥了一眼手中的文件，最后一次记忆其内容，然后将其折叠起来，塞回书里，再次从门缝中递出。一只小手出现并接过了它。

"Bye, then. I'll contact you if I need anything else. Through the usual means, of course."  
"那么，再见。如果还需要什么，我会通过常规方式联系你。"

There wasn't an answer, but Kaji did not expect one either.  
没有回应，但加持也并未期待会有。

---

Shinji crossed the dark kitchen, rubbing his damp hair with a towel. He always loved the feeling of his bath-warmed body cooling down in the night air. However, the grim mood that permeated this house today was preventing him from fully enjoying it as much as he usually did.  
真嗣穿过昏暗的厨房，用毛巾擦拭着湿漉漉的头发。他总是喜欢沐浴后温暖的身体在夜风中逐渐冷却的感觉。然而，今天家中弥漫的沉重气氛让他无法像往常那样尽情享受。

As he walked toward his room, Shinji checked the house through his peripheral vision. Everything that should be turned off was off, and the veranda door and kitchen window were open just the right amount. As had been the case for the past few days, Ms. Misato had disappeared into her room without a word, doors closed. Shinji nodded to himself and headed down the hall.  
当他走向自己的房间时，真嗣用眼角余光扫视了整个房子。该关的灯都已熄灭，阳台门和厨房窗户也恰到好处地敞开着。如同过去几天一样，美里小姐一言不发地消失在自己的房间里，房门紧闭。真嗣暗自点头，沿着走廊走去。

Just as Ms. Misato did not even comment about the big change that was Shinji and Asuka's dating, instead largely glossing over it as if she hadn't noticed, the fact that Shinji and Asuka were sharing a room at night seemed to have become just as much of a given. Aside from her early morning conversation with Shinji a few days ago, Ms. Misato had not directly mentioned the matter since, nor gave any indication that she was even aware of it. Just like that, the new routine had settled into place.  
正如美里小姐对真嗣和明日香开始交往的大变化未置一词，反而大多时候都视而不见，仿佛她并未察觉一样，真嗣和明日香晚上共处一室的事实似乎也变得理所当然了。除了几天前清晨与真嗣的那番对话外，美里小姐自那以后便未再直接提及此事，也没有表现出她对此有所察觉的迹象。就这样，新的日常模式悄然形成。

In fact, Shinji traversing through the darkened house after his bath was yet another part of this new routine. Until then, as the only male in the house, Shinji had been the first to take his nightly bath, followed by Ms. Misato, and Asuka as the last one.  
事实上，真嗣洗完澡后穿过昏暗的屋子也是这新日常的一部分。在此之前，作为家中唯一的男性，真嗣总是第一个洗澡，接着是美里小姐，而明日香则是最后一个。

It wasn't too difficult to adjust the order. Shinji's explanation, that he was sluggish because of his injury and he didn't want to make people behind him wait longer than usual and thus cut their precious sleeping hours, was accepted by Ms. Misato without much hassle. It wasn't even a lie, exactly, but he didn't dare tell her the real reason.  
调整顺序并不难。真嗣解释说，由于受伤他行动迟缓，不想让后面的人等太久，从而缩短他们宝贵的睡眠时间，这个理由被美里小姐轻易接受了。这虽不完全是谎言，但他也不敢告诉她真正的原因。

As he entered the hallway, there was only one room with light leaking through a crack in the door. Shinji almost reflexively knocked, then stopped, realizing that it was a bit of an odd thing to do. He cautiously opened the door.  
当他走进走廊时，只有一间房门透出光线。真嗣几乎是下意识地敲了敲门，随即停下，意识到这有点奇怪。他小心翼翼地推开了门。

The light was harsh upon his eyes, adjusted as they were to the dimness of the rest of the apartment, but it was the smell that invaded his senses more intensely. A powdery smell that was characteristic of a woman's room. It felt almost unreal that the kind of thing he used to smell whenever he went into Ms. Misato and Asuka's room to clean it was now coming from his own room. Perhaps that was his new reality now.  
光线刺眼，他的眼睛已适应了公寓其他地方的昏暗，但更强烈的是那股气味。一种粉状的、带有女性房间特征的香味。他几乎不敢相信，这种他过去常在打扫美里小姐和明日香房间时闻到的味道，现在竟来自他自己的房间。或许这就是他新的现实。

The culprit of all this, who had all but abandoned her own room these nights in favor of his, who had also moved many of her belongings here and made the small room even more cluttered, was lying on her stomach on Shinji's bed, looking at her cell phone. Her fingers were moving busily, apparently texting someone. One shoulder of her loose T-shirt had slipped off, revealing an expanse of pale skin. Despite the preparation he did in the bathroom, Shinji felt something throb down there.  
这一切的始作俑者，这些天几乎放弃了她自己的房间而选择他的房间，还将许多个人物品搬来，使得这小房间更加杂乱，此刻正趴在真嗣的床上，盯着手机。她的手指忙碌地移动着，显然是在发短信。她宽松的 T 恤衫肩部滑落，露出一片白皙的肌肤。尽管在浴室里做了准备，真嗣还是感到某种悸动。

"What are you doing? Turn off the light and come in."  
"你在干什么？关灯进来吧。"

It was only after hearing Asuka's soft voice that Shinji realized he had been standing in the doorway for an unnaturally long time. Grabbing the towel draped over his head, he ruffled his hair one last time, then closed the door, turned off the light, hung the towel over the back of the chair, and headed for the bed. Asuka scooted to one side, holding the covers up for him to sneak in.  
直到听到明日香柔和的声音，真嗣才意识到自己已经在门口站了异常长的时间。他抓起搭在头上的毛巾，最后一次揉了揉头发，然后关上门，熄了灯，把毛巾挂在了椅背上，走向床铺。明日香挪到一边，掀起被子让他悄悄钻进来。

She was still holding her phone in one hand, the glow of the screen the only illumination in the darkened room. Shinji carefully lowered himself into the narrow space beside her. Asuka pulled the futon over him. As she lay back, her strangely impassive gaze swept over Shinji and fixed itself somewhere on the ceiling. The blue light from her phone gave her face a harsh cast.  
她一只手还拿着手机，屏幕的微光是黑暗房间里唯一的照明。真嗣小心翼翼地滑进她身旁的狭窄空间。明日香拉过被褥盖在他身上。她躺回原位，目光异常冷漠地扫过真嗣，最终定格在天花板的某处。手机发出的蓝光让她的脸显得格外冷峻。

It was the first time he'd seen Asuka like that in his bed since they'd started sharing it. Usually Asuka would start kissing him as soon as he settled in, and when they'd felt they'd done enough of that they would pull apart a little, talk for a bit, and then fall asleep. Asuka had called those bedtime kisses 'rent collection'. Shinji thought it was kinda cute, although he couldn't understand why he, as the owner of the room, was supposed to pay rent to her, though he couldn't bring himself to ask.  
自从他们开始共用这张床以来，这是他第一次看到明日香以这种方式躺在他的床上。通常明日香一躺下就会开始吻他，当他们觉得吻得够多了，就会稍稍分开，聊一会儿，然后入睡。明日香称这些睡前吻为‘收租’。真嗣觉得这挺可爱的，尽管他不明白为什么作为房间主人的他，要向她支付租金，虽然他也没勇气问出口。

Be that as it may, the last few days had been very happy days for Shinji. Maybe the happiest of his life, or at least that's what he felt. Whenever he watched Asuka sleeping with a soft smile on her face, in his bed. Whenever he woke up in the morning with her beside him and felt his heart melt in his chest. Whenever he found himself looking forward to bedtime, even before the sun was down yet, and found himself impatiently wishing for his ribs to just heal already. He always assumed that Asuka would accept him - _all_ of him - when that finally happened.  
尽管如此，最近几天对真嗣来说是非常快乐的日子。也许是他一生中最快乐的，或者至少他是这么感觉的。每当他看着明日香带着柔和的微笑睡在他的床上。每当他早上醒来，她就在他身边，感到心在胸中融化。每当他发现自己期待着睡前时光，甚至在太阳还没落山之前，就急切地希望自己的肋骨能快点愈合。他总是以为，当那一天终于到来时，明日香会接受他——全部的他。

That was until this evening.  
直到今晚之前。

Now Shinji was nervous. Nervous and anxious. Because what he was seeing was a continuation of something that had been going on since earlier in the evening: Asuka's silence. She seemed distracted. Lost in thought. Shinji hoped that maybe things would be different by the time he got out of the bath, that Asuka would have gotten over whatever it was that was bothering her and smile and kiss him as usual, but it was obvious that this was not the case. Shinji's anxiety, which had been building up inside him since he first noticed her strange mood, began to spiral.  
现在，真嗣感到紧张。既紧张又焦虑。因为他所看到的是自傍晚以来一直在持续的事情的延续：明日香的沉默。她似乎心不在焉，陷入了沉思。真嗣希望在他洗完澡后，明日香能克服困扰她的事情，像往常一样微笑并亲吻他，但显然情况并非如此。自从他第一次注意到她奇怪的情绪以来，真嗣内心的焦虑开始螺旋上升。

They say that it is human nature to be afraid of the unknown. In this case, though, Shinji figured he had a pretty good idea what the reason was behind her silence. The knowledge only made him more uneasy.  
人们常说，害怕未知是人类的本性。然而，在这种情况下，真嗣认为自己对她的沉默背后的原因有一个相当好的猜测。这种认知只让他更加不安。

He looked at Asuka. She still wasn't saying anything. Her eyes were still dull, still far away. His mind began to race, unsure exactly how to approach this. He swallowed. Maybe it was finally his turn to collect the damn rent. Maybe that would lighten the mood and make her feel better. It was worth trying. That kind of thing always worked between them, after all.  
他看着明日香。她仍然一言不发。她的眼神依旧呆滞，依旧遥远。他的思绪开始飞速运转，不确定该如何应对这种情况。他咽了咽口水。也许终于轮到他来收那该死的租金了。也许这会缓和气氛，让她感觉好些。值得一试。毕竟，这种事情在他们之间总是奏效的。

But his body wasn't moving the way his mind was. It wasn't because it hurt. It was true that his chest still tingled when he turned at the wrong angle or moved too fast, but it wasn't physical pain that was holding Shinji's limbs down now and refusing to let go. It was indecision. Maybe he was overthinking. Maybe he was totally wrong, actually, and his plan, constructed entirely around a hasty assumption, would result in the landlord kicking him out into the cold. Or maybe he was _right,_ but his reaction would still be wrong, and the result would be the same. So he just lay still, breathing, and so did Asuka, until the blue glow of Asuka's cell phone screen abruptly disappeared, plunging the room into total darkness.  
但他的身体并未如心意般行动。并非因为疼痛。确实，当他转身角度不对或动作过快时，胸口仍会隐隐作痛，但此刻束缚住真嗣四肢、不肯放手的并非肉体之痛。是犹豫不决。或许他想得太多。或许他完全错了，实际上，他那基于仓促假设构建的计划，只会导致房东将他赶出寒冷的门外。又或许他是对的，但他的反应仍会出错，结果依旧相同。于是他只是静静躺着，呼吸着，而明日香也是如此，直到明日香手机屏幕的蓝光骤然消失，房间陷入一片漆黑。

The bottom line was, he didn't know how Asuka would react, and there was only one way to find out, because he didn't have any other ideas. The darkness seemed to have released his temporary paralysis. So Shinji pushed himself up quickly, a little too hard for his injured ribs, desperate to not give her a single chance to say anything. The futon rustled. Shinji's descent was swift: he caught her surprised yelp in his open mouth.  
底线是，他不知道明日香会有何反应，而找出答案的唯一方法就是行动，因为他别无他法。黑暗似乎解除了他暂时的瘫痪。于是真嗣迅速起身，尽管受伤的肋骨让他有些吃力，但他急切地不想给她任何开口的机会。被褥发出窸窣声。真嗣的下降迅速而果断：他用自己的嘴堵住了她惊愕的呼声。

Asuka did not push him away, contrary to what Shinji feared. Instead, long, cold fingers curled around the back of his neck, sending a pleasant shudder down his spine. Their legs tangled together in a way that was rapidly becoming familiar. He thrust his tongue aggressively against hers, and Asuka responded in kind. Asuka's mouth was, unlike her fingers, hot, and tasted of toothpaste and hesitation. As Shinji's hands slid down and touched her through the thin material of her t-shirt, something between a moan and a sigh escaped from deep in her throat. Most of it couldn't escape their interlocked lips, so half of it was exhaled into Shinji's mouth and the other buffeted his face through her nostrils.  
与碇真嗣所担心的相反，明日香并未将他推开。相反，她那冰冷而修长的手指环绕在他颈后，带来一阵愉悦的颤栗传遍他的脊背。两人的腿交缠在一起，这种感觉正迅速变得熟悉起来。他猛烈地用舌头抵住她的，明日香也以同样的方式回应。明日香的唇舌，与她的手指不同，是炽热的，带着牙膏的清新与一丝迟疑。当真嗣的手滑下，隔着她薄薄的 T 恤触碰到她时，她喉咙深处发出了一声介于呻吟与叹息之间的声音。大部分声音被他们紧贴的唇封锁，一半呼入了真嗣的口中，另一半则通过她的鼻息拂过他的脸颊。

His thumb scraped across the hardened point of her nipple, separated from it only by a thin layer of fabric. Asuka's breath hitched and her back arched to press herself even tighter against him. Shinji moaned into the kiss. With that, his patience had reached its end. His ribs still hurt, sure, but it was background noise, a low simmering burn. He was ready, and Asuka could definitely feel it, and it wouldn't be difficult, really, just needed to shift things around a little bit. Overcome with the thought, his hips bucked involuntarily against her, and with that motion a stabbing pain shot through his chest, hot and searing as lightning.  
他的拇指摩挲着她乳尖硬挺的顶端，两者之间仅隔着一层薄薄的布料。明日香的呼吸一滞，背部不由自主地弓起，更加紧密地贴向他。真嗣在亲吻中发出呻吟。至此，他的耐心已到了极限。肋骨还在疼，当然，但那只是背景噪音，一种低沉的灼烧感。他已准备就绪，明日香肯定能感受到，而这并不难，真的，只需稍稍调整一下。被这个念头驱使，他的臀部不由自主地向她顶去，这一动作却让一阵剧痛如闪电般刺穿他的胸膛，炽热而灼人。

Spitting out a groan of frustration, Shinji rolled off of Asuka's body and directly into something hard that stabbed directly, agonizingly into his side. Shinji's mouth opened wide in a silent scream. A tear slipped out and ran down his cheek.  
真嗣吐出一声沮丧的呻吟，从明日香身上滚落，直接撞上了一个硬物，尖锐地刺入他的侧腹，痛彻心扉。真嗣的嘴张得大大的，却发不出声音，只有无声的尖叫。一滴泪滑落，顺着他的脸颊流下。

Asuka's face, looking in Shinji's direction, was flushed, noticeable even in the darkness. Even through the storm of his lust and pain, Shinji carefully watched her. Maybe she was feeling better. Maybe she was about to smile now.  
明日香的脸转向真嗣的方向，即使在黑暗中也能看出她满脸通红。尽管欲望与疼痛的风暴席卷着他，真嗣仍仔细地观察着她。也许她感觉好些了。也许她现在就要微笑了。

Instead, Asuka opened her mouth, then closed it again. She sat up. Shinji didn't have enough time to guess what the whole delay meant.  
然而，明日香张开了嘴，又再次闭上。她坐起身来。真嗣没有足够的时间去猜测这整个拖延意味着什么。

"What are you doing? Oh, right..." Asuka's hand slipped between Shinji's body and the mattress and yanked. The sensation was akin to getting a tooth pulled. Asuka glanced at her hand.  
“你在干什么？哦，对了……”明日香的手滑入真嗣的身体与床垫之间，猛地一拽。那种感觉就像是被拔掉了一颗牙。明日香瞥了一眼自己的手。

"My phone was there, huh."  
“我的手机在那儿，是吧。”

Shinji raised his hand and wiped his cheek. It was so embarrassing to cry in front of his girlfriend, but he couldn't help it. He couldn't quite keep the shame and frustration out of his voice.  
真嗣举起手擦了擦脸颊。在女朋友面前哭实在是太尴尬了，但他控制不住。他的声音里无法完全掩饰住羞愧和沮丧。

"What were you doing with your phone?"  
“你刚才在手机上做什么？”

Asuka closed the phone. "Texting my girl friends."  
明日香合上了手机。“在给闺蜜们发短信。”

Then her head snapped around, her hair rustling against the pillow. Shinji couldn't be sure in the dark, but he thought he could see her eyebrows rising.  
随后她的头猛地转了过来，头发在枕头上沙沙作响。真嗣在黑暗中无法确定，但他觉得他能看到她的眉毛微微上扬。

"Why? Are you jealous that I didn't pay attention to you right away when you walked in?"  
“为什么？你是不是嫉妒我一进门没有立刻注意到你？”

Shinji didn't react to that. He wasn't sure how to. He wasn't in the mood for banter right now, and he was pretty sure Asuka wasn't either. So what was the point? One wrong word and things would become even more awkward than they already were.  
真嗣对此没有反应。他不确定该如何回应。他现在没心情开玩笑，而且他很确定明日香也是。那么，这有什么意义呢？只要说错一个字，事情就会比现在更加尴尬。

"Geez, you look constipated. What's so hard about what I asked?"  
"天哪，你看起来便秘似的。我刚才问的问题有那么难吗？"

The natural, almost amused tone of her voice irritated Shinji. Maybe a little too much.  
她那自然而然、几乎带着笑意的语气让真嗣感到恼火。或许有点过头了。

_I was walking on eggshells this whole evening! Does she even know that?!  
我今晚一直在小心翼翼地行事！她知道吗？！_

Shinji wasn't in a position to protest now, though, so he swallowed the words that had risen to the top of his throat. There was a part of him that realized that being silent wasn't the best choice either, considering Asuka's character, but beyond that, he honestly did not know what else he could do. Nor did he want to, either, to be honest.  
虽然真嗣现在没有立场抗议，但他还是咽下了已经涌到喉咙口的话。他心里有一部分明白，考虑到明日香的性格，保持沉默并不是最佳选择，但除此之外，他真的不知道还能做些什么。老实说，他也不想这么做。

Asuka sighed. "Sulking again. You've been like that all evening."  
明日香叹了口气。"又在闹别扭了。你整个晚上都是这样。"

The word _when_ almost escaped Shinji's lips. What Asuka just said was so unexpected that he was caught off guard. Maybe Asuka wasn't the moody one after all. But the thought was quickly dismissed. He never _sulked._ It was always Asuka. And if he did, it was because Asuka was doing it already, which then made him nervous in turn.  
“什么时候”这几个字差点从真嗣的唇边溜走。明日香刚才的话出乎意料，让他措手不及。也许明日香并不是那个情绪化的人。但这个念头很快就被抛开了。他从不闹别扭。一直都是明日香。如果他真的闹别扭了，那也是因为明日香先这样做了，这让他反过来感到紧张。

Who was the one who fell silent the moment Ms. Misato told them that the sync test was scheduled for tomorrow? How could she act like this to Shinji, when he was the one running himself ragged trying to please her?  
是谁在美里小姐告诉他们同步测试定在明天时立刻沉默了？她怎么能这样对待真嗣，明明是他不顾一切地努力取悦她？

As he bit his lip and looked away, Asuka reached toward Shinji's face. He automatically leaned into her touch, momentarily forgetting his irritation.  
当他咬着嘴唇移开视线时，明日香伸手触碰真嗣的脸颊。他本能地靠近她的触碰，暂时忘记了心中的不快。

This was probably extremely pathetic. Shinji was aware of that. He was like a puppy, constantly checking its owner's face for signs of approval, and becoming angry and resentful when there were none. But the moment a scrap of affection was thrown at him, there he was, wagging his tail like nothing ever happened.  
这大概非常可悲。真嗣心里明白。他就像一只小狗，不断察看主人的脸色以寻求认可，一旦得不到便生气怨恨。但只要有一丝关爱抛向他，他就会摇着尾巴，仿佛什么都没发生过。

But at the same time, Shinji found it almost surreal that he felt annoyed by this girl, even if only for a moment. She told him she liked him. She was here with him. And even when she wasn't around, just the mere thought of her brought a smile to his face.  
但与此同时，真嗣觉得这种感觉几乎不真实，他竟然会因为这女孩而感到恼火，哪怕只是一瞬间。她告诉他她喜欢他。她和他在一起。即使她不在身边，只要想到她，他的脸上就会浮现出微笑。

_And she might start hating me tomorrow. This could be our last time lying together like this.  
也许她明天就会开始讨厌我。这可能是我们最后一次这样躺在一起了。_

The thought made Shinji's heart sink. He had been unconsciously avoiding the thought for the whole evening, refusing to even put it into words. But now it was rearing up in front of him, concrete and terribly real. A cold sweat began to form on his forehead. And then salvation came in the form of Asuka's voice.  
这个念头让真嗣的心沉了下去。整个晚上他都在无意识地回避这个想法，拒绝将其付诸言语。但现在它却突然出现在他面前，具体而可怕地真实。他的额头上开始冒出冷汗。就在这时，救赎以明日香的声音形式降临。

"Come here. You haven't paid rent yet."  
"过来。你还没交房租呢。"

Shinji obediently pushed himself up and moved toward Asuka, but she leaned in before he could get very far. After a short, tantalizing kiss, Asuka pulled away. The hot sighs that escaped both of their mouths mingled for a moment before Asuka gripped Shinji's head with both hands and looked into his eyes from a finger's-length away. Shinji's heart, already beating rapidly, sped up even more when he saw Asuka's dark eyes hardening.  
真嗣顺从地起身，朝明日香走去，但她在他还没走多远时就倾身向前。短暂而撩人的一吻后，明日香退开。两人呼出的热气交织片刻，明日香双手紧握真嗣的头，近在咫尺地凝视他的眼睛。看到明日香深邃的眼眸变得坚定，真嗣本已急促的心跳更加剧烈。

"Shinji." “真嗣。”

"Yeah?" “嗯？”

"You...can't do it yet, can you?"  
"你……还做不到，对吧？"

_Do what?_ he almost asked. A rhetorical question. One of the myriad things Asuka abhorred. Something he constantly had to watch out for.  
做什么？他差点问出口。一个反问句。这是无数让明日香深恶痛绝的事情之一。他必须时刻警惕。

It was a rhetorical question because Shinji knew exactly what Asuka was really asking. It was the same question he had asked himself many times in the past few days. It floated between them now, almost dreamlike. So he shook his head, as he did every time he thought about it.  
这是个反问句，因为真嗣清楚明日香真正在问什么。这也是他过去几天里反复问自己的问题。此刻，这个问题仿佛梦幻般飘荡在他们之间。于是他摇了摇头，就像每次想到这个问题时那样。

"I don't think I'm ready yet. It's hard to move at certain angles and, ah, speeds…"  
“我觉得我还没准备好。某些角度和速度下，移动起来很困难……”

It wasn't the only reason he was reluctant, but it was the most obvious one. As for the rest, trying to explain it would be mentally exhausting. Shinji didn't think he had the strength for it right now.  
这并非他犹豫的唯一原因，但无疑是最显而易见的。至于其他，试图解释只会让人心力交瘁。真嗣不认为自己现在有那份力气去阐述。

Asuka cocked her head slightly. "Even if you...even if you don't have to move? You could...you know...just lie on your back and..."  
明日香微微侧头，"即使你...即使你不必移动？你可以...你知道的...就那样平躺着..."

Like the question before it, this was something Shinji thought about several times a day. And like that question, it was something he had already come to his own conclusion about. What he did not expect was Asuka saying those... things. It made his head spin with dizzying new images.  
如同之前那个问题，这是真嗣每日都会反复思索的事情。与那个问题一样，他已得出了自己的结论。他未曾预料到的是，明日香会说出那些...话语。这让他脑海中涌现出令人眩晕的新画面。

"Well, it's not just the movement that's the problem. Breathing too fast..."  
"嗯，问题不仅仅在于动作。呼吸过快……"

Once again, that wasn't the only reason. Even if he was physically fine, Shinji would rather do it during the day, when they had the apartment to themselves. He didn't want to do it here in his room at night, especially when Ms. Misato was sleeping across the house. It felt like a betrayal of Ms. Misato's trust. She was turning a blind eye to them sleeping together because she trusted Shinji not to cross that line, he was sure of it.  
再次强调，这并非唯一原因。即便身体状况良好，真嗣更倾向于在白天进行，那时公寓里只有他们两人。他不想在晚上自己的房间里做这件事，尤其是在美里小姐在屋子另一头睡觉的时候。这感觉像是对美里小姐信任的背叛。他确信，美里小姐之所以对他们同床共枕视而不见，是因为她相信真嗣不会逾越那条界限。

And even that wasn't the end of it. If the right time came, Shinji wanted it to happen in a more peaceful, romantic setting. He didn't want to do it under the pressure he was feeling right now, the feeling of being chased by something, full of anxiety. He didn't think Asuka would understand his point even if he told her, which would only lead to an argument, an argument he was sure he wasn't going to win.  
即便如此，这还不是全部。如果时机合适，真嗣希望在一个更宁静、浪漫的环境中发生。他不想在当前这种被追逐、充满焦虑的压力下进行。他不认为即使告诉明日香，她会理解他的想法，这只会引发争吵，而他确信自己不会赢得这场争吵。

Luckily for Shinji, Asuka seemed to accept his explanations for now. Although it wasn't the end of her questions.  
幸运的是，对于真嗣来说，明日香似乎暂时接受了他的解释。尽管这并不意味着她的问题就此结束。

"Then can you…can you help me, at least?"  
“那么你能……至少能帮我一下吗？”

This one was truly indecipherable, so Shinji had to ask. "What? Help with what...?"  
这个请求实在难以理解，真嗣不得不问：“什么？帮什么……？”

Asuka's impatience was palpable. The slightly receding chin, the warmth of her forehead pressing against his, the outline of her body as she shivered slightly - all of her exuded frustration and desire.  
明日香的不耐烦显而易见。她微微后缩的下巴，额头紧贴着他的温暖，她颤抖着的身体轮廓——她的一切都流露出挫败与渴望。

"I asked you if you could help me. I've been holding out, but I can't anymore. I can't do this anymore. If you can't...you know..._do me,_ then I'll...deal with it alone."  
“我问过你能不能帮我。我一直忍耐，但现在不行了。我再也做不到了。如果你不能……你知道的……满足我，那我就……自己解决。”

The last part was uttered barely above a whisper. Shinji wondered if he heard her right. His mouth moved on its own.  
最后那句话几乎是耳语般低沉。真嗣不确定自己是否听对了。他的嘴不由自主地动了。

"What am I supposed to help with? What are you going to do alone?"  
“我应该帮什么忙？你打算一个人做什么？”

Asuka's eyebrows gathered. "Are you really going to make me say it?"  
绫波的眉毛皱了起来。“你真的要我明说吗？”

_Oh._ Shinji swallowed hard. He got it now. What Asuka implied was so lewd and arousing that even just thinking about it would've made him ejaculate right then and there if he hadn't already masturbated in the bathroom. Shinji shook his head slightly and mouthed the first question that came to mind. Only then would he be able to distract himself from the sight in his head.  
哦。真嗣艰难地咽了口唾沫。他现在明白了。绫波暗示的事情如此下流且令人兴奋，以至于他只要一想到就会当场射出来，如果不是他之前已经在浴室自慰过的话。真嗣轻轻摇了摇头，嘴里吐出第一个浮现的问题。只有这样，他才能从脑海中的画面中分心。

"How... how do I even help you with something like that..."  
“我……我该怎么帮你这种事……”

Shinji could hear Asuka swallowing. "It isn't hard. Use your brain. While I do...um, _that,_ just touch me. Kiss me. Do what you did to me the last time we tried. Or like that time in the lounge."  
真嗣能听到明日香咽口水的声音。“这不难。动动脑子。当我……呃，做那事的时候，就摸我。吻我。像上次我们尝试时那样，或者像在休息室那次。”

Shinji was not sure about this. At all. But he couldn't come up with a good reason to refuse her. And Asuka wasn't waiting for his answer anyway. She lowered her hands and bent down slightly. A slight rustle followed. Straightening back up, Asuka tossed something over their heads. Shinji's head followed its progress through the air - he realized about one second before they hit the ground with a soft _fwump_ that they were her _panties._ It struck him, then, what was about to happen - what was _happening,_ right here and now. Asuka's hand on his neck brought his attention back to the present. He felt a bit dizzy. She pecked him on the cheek, just once. The soft pressure of her lips on his skin sent a jolt through him. He realized that he had been frozen, and could now move again.  
真嗣对此并不确定，一点儿也不。但他想不出拒绝她的好理由。而且明日香也没在等他的回答。她放下双手，微微弯下腰。一阵轻微的窸窣声后，明日香直起身，将某样东西抛过他们头顶。真嗣的目光随着它在空中划过——他意识到，就在它们轻轻落地的一秒前，那是她的内裤。那一刻，他明白了即将发生的事——正在发生的事，就在此时此地。明日香放在他脖子上的手将他的注意力拉回现实。他感到有些晕眩。她轻轻在他脸颊上啄了一下。她柔软的唇触碰他的皮肤，让他浑身一震。他意识到自己一直僵立着，现在终于可以动了。

"Kiss my neck again," Asuka whispered. Her voice was high, and breathy, and uncharacteristically shy. "I liked it a lot."  
"再吻我的脖子，" 明日香低声说道。她的声音高亢、喘息，出奇地羞涩。"我非常喜欢。"

She wasn't entirely able to keep the tremor out of her voice. All of Shinji's hesitation melted away. She needed him. She liked what he did for her. How could he refuse her? Shinji instantly forgot everything that had been holding him back. He was willing to do anything for her at this point, so he cradled his heaving chest and leaned down to Asuka's neck.  
她无法完全抑制声音中的颤抖。所有真嗣的犹豫都消融了。她需要他。她喜欢他为她所做的一切。他怎能拒绝她？真嗣立刻忘记了所有束缚他的东西。此时此刻，他愿意为她做任何事，于是他抱紧自己剧烈起伏的胸膛，俯身向明日香的脖子。

Asuka's hand gently pushed Shinji's head away. "Wait."  
明日香的手轻轻推开真嗣的头。"等等。"

"Huh?" Shinji's voice was shaky too, but it didn't occur to him to be embarrassed about it.  
"啊？" 真嗣的声音也颤抖着，但他并没有想到为此感到尴尬。

"Two conditions. One. Never look down. Keep your eyes up here. Two. Don't stop until I tell you to stop."  
"两个条件。第一，永远不要低头。保持眼睛向上看。第二，不要停下，直到我让你停下。"

Shinji nodded obediently.  
真嗣顺从地点了点头。

There was a moment of silence as Asuka looked into Shinji's eyes. It broke when she quickly brought up the hand that had been between her legs until now. Before he could ask what she was doing, Asuka shoved her fingers through Shinji's lips. A salty taste invaded his tongue. Shinji yelped and reflexively leaned back, but the fingers were already gone by then. Under Shinji's questioning look, Asuka spread her moistened fingers as if for inspection. Shinji's saliva formed thick ropes between them. Then she made an almost solemn face, closed her eyes, and then moved her hand down again.  
在那一刻，沉默笼罩着他们，明日香凝视着真嗣的眼睛。直到她迅速抬起一直放在双腿间的手，这份静默才被打破。真嗣还没来得及问她在做什么，明日香就将手指塞进了他的唇间。一股咸味侵袭了他的舌头。真嗣惊叫一声，本能地向后仰，但那时手指已经抽离。在真嗣疑惑的目光下，明日香摊开她湿润的手指，仿佛在展示什么。真嗣的唾液在她的指间形成了粗粗的丝线。随后，她做出一副几乎肃穆的表情，闭上眼睛，再次将手移了下去。

Shinji heard a rustling sound, followed by the hard sensation of her knee touching his thigh. A crease appeared in her brow, and a small sigh escaped her tightly pressed lips. Shinji felt a strange chill run down his spine, even as he was completely mesmerized by the sight. It was a different feeling from the mad jealousy he'd felt in the lounge before, or the rush of lust in the kitchen back then.  
真嗣听到一阵窸窣声，紧接着是她的膝盖触碰到他大腿的坚硬感觉。她的眉头微微皱起，紧闭的唇间逸出一声轻叹。真嗣感到一股奇异的寒意沿着脊背而下，尽管他被眼前的景象完全迷住了。这与之前在休息室里感受到的疯狂嫉妒，或是那时厨房中涌动的欲望截然不同。

The whole thing felt unreal. It was all so sudden - bath to bed to straddling his girlfriend, who happened to be naked from the waist down, all in the space of five minutes and with little to no input required from him. Maybe this was what she felt that morning when he'd all but attacked her and forced himself on her, Shinji thought almost ruefully.  
这一切感觉如此不真实。一切都来得太突然——从洗澡到上床，再到跨坐在他的女友身上，而她恰好下半身一丝不挂，这一切在五分钟内发生，他几乎没怎么参与。也许这就是她那天早上感受到的，当他几乎攻击般地强迫她接受自己时，真嗣有些懊悔地想。

"What are you doing?" “你在做什么？”

He twitched, jolted out of his reverie. Asuka's eyes were still stubbornly closed. Right. She needed him right now. She'd said so herself. So Shinji leaned into Asuka and kissed her.  
他微微一颤，从沉思中惊醒。明日香的双眼依旧固执地闭着。对，她现在需要他。她自己说的。于是真嗣靠近明日香，吻了她。

What followed was a whirlwind - chaotic, fast, almost violent, impossible to keep up with. In that pulsing vortex the only thing Shinji could feel was Asuka, Asuka, Asuka. Her tongue intertwining with his. Her breasts, the softness of them, the way they fit perfectly into his hand. Her nipples, hard as pebbles under his touch. The little whimpers she'd make when he gently pinched them. The slightly salty taste of her skin, the way she gasped as he laved her neck with his tongue. He dared to nip her with his teeth, just beneath the corner of her jaw, and at that she twitched and a shuddering little noise escaped her and her knees knocked against the inside of his thighs. He felt himself throb and pressed himself closer against her. The narrow space between them was wonderfully, unbearably hot. He could smell her, overwhelmingly - shampoo and body wash and lotion and toothpaste and skin and something else, something purely, rawly _Asuka,_ that was at once foreign and familiar and that settled in some deep part of his brain and drove him to kiss her ever harder. Asuka's hot breath. Asuka's small, stifled moans, nearly inaudible over the rustling of the futon. And something else, a soft, wet noise, audible only in the spaces between their breaths.  
接下来的一切如旋风般——混乱、迅速，几乎带着暴烈，难以跟上节奏。在那悸动的漩涡中，真嗣唯一能感受到的只有明日香，明日香，明日香。她的舌头与他的交缠。她的乳房，柔软无比，恰到好处地落入他掌中。她的乳头，在他触碰下硬如小石子。每当他轻捏它们时，她发出的细小呜咽声。她肌肤上略带咸味的味道，当他用舌头舔舐她颈部时她倒抽一口气的样子。他大胆地用牙齿轻咬她下颌角下方，她随即一颤，发出颤抖的低吟，膝盖撞上了他的大腿内侧。他感到自己悸动不已，更紧地贴向她。两人之间狭窄的空间热得令人难以忍受。他能闻到她的气息，强烈到无法忽视——洗发水、沐浴露、乳液、牙膏、肌肤，还有某种纯粹、原始的明日香特质，既陌生又熟悉，深深烙印在他脑海深处，驱使他更热烈地吻她。明日香炽热的呼吸。明日香压抑的细小呻吟，几乎被榻榻米的沙沙声淹没。 还有别的声音，一种柔和、湿润的声响，只有在他们呼吸的间隙才能听见。

And Asuka's hand. One moment it pulled hungrily at the back of his head. The next it dug into his shoulder as if hanging on for dear life. And the next it flew down to his groin, as if checking things down there, only to come up as if dissatisfied, grabbing the back of his hand and moving it here, there, and there, as if giving him directions on where to touch and grab.  
还有明日香的手。一会儿它急切地拉扯着他的后脑勺，下一刻又紧紧抓住他的肩膀，仿佛在拼命坚持。接着它迅速滑向他的下体，似乎在检查那里的情况，随后又不满地抬起，抓住他的手，引导它这里、那里、还有那里，仿佛在指示他该触摸和抓握的地方。

Shinji honestly did not know what to make of this situation. He thought, almost absent-mindedly, that he liked it. He definitely felt dizzy. His groin throbbed dangerously, forcing him to curl all ten toes tightly. But every time Asuka feathered her hand up and down the length of him through his clothes his mind went white and he felt like he was going to faint. If he hadn't already released the worst of his lust down the bathtub sewer, he would have completely soaked his shorts. Even now, things felt dangerously damp.  
真嗣实在不知道该如何理解这一局面。他几乎心不在焉地想，他喜欢这样。他确实感到头晕目眩。他的下体危险地悸动着，迫使他紧紧蜷缩起所有的脚趾。但每当明日香隔着衣服轻抚他的身体时，他的思绪就会一片空白，感觉自己快要晕倒。如果他还没有在浴缸下水道释放掉最强烈的欲望，他肯定会完全浸湿自己的短裤。即便现在，情况也感觉相当潮湿危险。

But beyond all that, more than anything else really, Shinji was disoriented. He wasn't sure what was happening, nor was he aware of the passing of time, and not in a good way. He wasn't sure if what he was doing was leading to anything, or if it was really helping Asuka. A distinct sense of foreboding started to seep through his excitement. The root of his tongue was getting stiff, and he could no longer taste anything from Asuka's neck.  
但除此之外，真正让真嗣感到迷失的，是那种无法言说的困惑。他不确定正在发生什么，也不清楚时间的流逝，并非以一种好的方式。他不确定自己所做的一切是否能带来任何结果，或者是否真的对明日香有所帮助。一种不祥的预感开始渗透进他的兴奋之中。他的舌根变得僵硬，再也尝不到明日香颈间的味道。

And just as Shinji's doubt was growing, Asuka let out a long, breathy sigh from deep within her throat, and her body trembled. Shinji almost immediately realized what had happened, but his body continued what it was doing. Asuka's instruction was definitely part of it, but it wasn't the only reason; he had a feeling that he shouldn't stop. That if he did, something bad would happen. So Shinji licked the side of Asuka's neck with the wistfulness of a dog licking its wound. When Asuka's shoulders slumped and she said "stop," in a weak voice, Shinji felt like he was going to cry. He couldn't shake the feeling that he had done something wrong.  
就在真嗣的疑虑愈发加深时，明日香从喉咙深处发出了一声悠长而轻柔的叹息，身体也随之颤抖。真嗣几乎立刻意识到发生了什么，但他的身体依旧继续着之前的动作。明日香的指示无疑是原因之一，但这并非全部；他有种感觉，如果他停下来，会有不好的事情发生。因此，真嗣带着一种近乎哀伤的渴望，像舔舐伤口的狗一样舔舐着明日香的脖颈。当明日香的肩膀垂下，用微弱的声音说出“停下”时，真嗣感到自己快要哭了。他无法摆脱那种自己做错了事的感觉。

Asuka's face was expressionless and her eyes were glassy when Shinji looked up. He forced his mouth open. It was dry.  
当真嗣抬头时，明日香的面无表情，眼神空洞。他费力地张开嘴，口干舌燥。

"Asuka... did you like it?" _Was I helpful? Was I useful?_  
“明日香……你喜欢吗？我帮上忙了吗？我有用吗？”

When she nodded with a faint smile, Shinji felt something akin to bliss. He hugged her as tightly as his aching chest would allow, and Asuka wrapped her arms around him and buried her head in his arms. Hugging her like this made things feel uncomfortably hot, but he didn't want to let go. When she slipped out of his arms eventually, Shinji's heart almost stopped beating.  
当她微微一笑点头时，真嗣感到一种近乎幸福的情绪。他紧紧地抱住她，尽管胸口疼痛难忍，明日香也环抱住他，将头埋在他的臂弯里。这样抱着她让感觉异常闷热，但他不想放手。当她最终从他怀中滑出时，真嗣的心几乎停止了跳动。

"Asuka...?" “明日香...？”

Asuka slowly sat up. Shinji pulled his body up as well. Her head was turned at an almost unnatural angle, making it impossible to see her face. Shinji prayed that it was because there was something she needed to check on that side of the room, that she wasn't looking away from him. When Asuka opened her mouth the next moment, her voice was so small and helpless, as if to mock Shinji's hope.  
明日香缓缓坐起身来。真嗣也跟着撑起自己的身体。她的头以一种近乎不自然的姿势扭向一边，使得他无法看到她的脸。真嗣祈祷着，希望她是因为那边房间有什么需要检查的东西，而不是在回避他。当下一刻明日香张开嘴时，她的声音如此微弱无助，仿佛在嘲弄真嗣的希望。

"I need to wash." “我需要洗个澡。”

She didn't wait for Shinji's answer and stood up. She was naked below her T-shirt, but Shinji's eyes barely registered it. He almost called out to Asuka out of some inexplicable feeling, but at the last second, he closed his mouth again.  
她没有等真嗣的回答就站了起来。她只穿着 T 恤，下半身赤裸，但真嗣的目光几乎没注意到这一点。他几乎出于某种莫名的感觉想要叫住明日香，但在最后一刻，他又闭上了嘴。

Asuka glanced back at Shinji when she reached the door, as if she read his mind. For a brief moment Shinji desperately searched for an excuse to talk to her, to stop her. In a last, desperate attempt, he picked up the panties lying next to the pillows.  
当绫波走到门口时，她回头瞥了一眼真嗣，仿佛看穿了他的心思。在那一瞬间，真嗣拼命寻找着与她交谈、留住她的借口。在最后的绝望尝试中，他拿起了枕头旁的内裤。

"What if you run into Ms. Misato..."  
“万一你碰到美里小姐……”

Asuka's gaze drifted to the corner of the room.  
绫波的目光飘向房间的一角。

"I'll come back after a shower."  
"我洗完澡就回来。"

The scraping sound of the sliding door seemed to scrape Shinji's heartstrings.  
滑动门的刮擦声仿佛刮在了真嗣的心弦上。

Asuka did not come back.  
明日香没有回来。

---

_What a small world we are living in.  
我们生活的世界真是小啊。_

That was what Fuyutsuki thought to himself as he watched the two women leave Ikari's office after their regular morning face-to-face report.  
这是冬月在看到两位女士在例行早间面对面汇报后离开碇的办公室时，心中所想。

Katsuragi. Akagi. And, come to think of it, Ikari, too. It was almost ridiculous that the core of the organization was so closely knit by blood. Unintentional nepotism, almost.  
葛城。赤城。还有，想想看，碇也是。这个组织的中心竟然如此紧密地由血缘联系在一起，简直荒谬。近乎无意的裙带关系。

His newfound awareness of it was, ironically, due to the fact he usually didn't think about it. He normally had a hard time truly connecting and labeling those names to the two young women. Because, in his old mind, those names were still tied to different people.  
讽刺的是，他之所以突然意识到这一点，正是因为他通常不会去想它。他通常很难真正将这些名字与那两位年轻女性联系起来并加以标签化。因为在他的旧思维中，这些名字仍然与不同的人联系在一起。

The visionary, who was treated like a clown for most of his career but never gave up on his theory. His work and even life itself were taken from him just as he was about to see his lifelong endeavors bear fruit. Now all of that had been disappeared into oblivion.  
这位梦想家，在他的职业生涯中大部分时间被当作小丑对待，但他从未放弃自己的理论。他的工作和甚至生命本身，就在他即将看到毕生努力结出果实之际被夺走。如今，这一切都已消失在遗忘之中。

And the other, one of the greatest geniuses of her generation, whose work remained unparalleled even to this day. Had she been able to use even half of her brain for self-reflection, her tragic end might have been avoided. Or not. Maybe she would have had to be removed some other way. She was too close to the core of the project. Too dangerous.  
而另一位，则是她那一代人中最伟大的天才之一，她的成就至今无人能及。如果她能用哪怕一半的大脑进行自我反思，她的悲剧结局或许可以避免。或者不会。也许她必须以其他方式被移除。她离项目的核心太近了。太危险了。

Fuyutsuki sighed. What would the two daughters they had left behind think if they realized the truth of their respective parent's death? Or the truth of their legacies? Fuyutsuki wondered if they would then come to the conclusion that they were being robbed, that their inheritance was being appropriated.  
冬月叹了口气。如果他们留下的两个女儿意识到各自父母死亡的真相，或是他们遗产的真相，她们会怎么想？冬月想知道她们是否会得出结论，认为自己在被剥夺，继承权被侵占。

He didn't think, however, that that was a fair criticism of him and the nature of his work. If they were to talk about poor orphans, they had Rei, Ikari's son, and Soryu's daughter. For one, they were the actual children in this situation. And for another, both Katsuragi and Akagi were helping Fuyutsuki to exploit and deceive them.  
然而，他认为这并不是对他及其工作性质的公正批评。如果要谈论可怜的孤儿，他们有碇的儿子真嗣和惣流的女儿。一方面，他们是这种情况下的真正孩子。另一方面，葛城和赤木都在帮助冬月利用和欺骗他们。

And if they were to talk about Katsuragi and Akagi's legacies, who else but NERV could keep them intact? Who else could inherit their dreams and make them come true? Humanity's doom was sealed. The Dead Sea Scrolls had foretold it, and any possible divergence would be corrected by SEELE at all costs. There was no way to prevent the return of the Great Tribulation. Which left only one choice: either humanity would be buried in eternal darkness with SEELE's victory, or Yui's vision would triumph and humanity would continue to exist. Some of the things he and Ikari were doing were quite regrettable, but they were all for the sake of that tenuous hope.  
若要论及葛城与赤木的遗志，除了 NERV，还有谁能将其完整保留？还有谁能继承他们的梦想并使之成真？人类的命运已然注定。《死海文书》早已预言，任何可能的偏差都将被 SEELE 不惜一切代价修正。大劫难的回归无可避免。这留给他们的只有一个选择：要么人类在 SEELE 的胜利中陷入永恒的黑暗，要么唯的愿景胜出，人类得以延续。他和碇所做的一些事情确实令人遗憾，但这一切都是为了那一线希望。

One might call this indifference to collateral damages a learned cynicism. To be quite honest, Fuyutsuki didn't feel much for the victims of his actions. It wasn't that he didn't feel any guilt whatsoever, but it also never gripped his heart or affected his actions in any meaningful way. He wasn't even sure when he had become like that. Maybe he was never as good a person as he thought he was. Or maybe it had been too long since he made a deal with the devil, and his heart had grown hard.  
或许可以将这种对附带损害的漠视称为习得的犬儒主义。老实说，冬月对那些因他行为而受难的人并无太多感触。并非他毫无愧疚，只是这种感觉从未深入内心，也未曾对他的行为产生实质影响。他甚至不确定自己何时变得如此。或许他从未如自己所想的那般善良。又或许，与魔鬼的交易已久，他的心早已变得坚硬。

The thought naturally drew Fuyutsuki's attention to the devil sitting right next to him. He was leaning back against the chair's backrest, his eyes closed.  
这个念头自然而然地将冬月注意力引向了坐在他身旁的恶魔。他正靠在椅背上，双眼紧闭。

_What is he even thinking?_ It wasn't an unfamiliar question. Even after all these years, Fuyutsuki still found it hard to understand Ikari at times, and the lingering suspicion in the back of his mind was rearing its ugly head more and more often as of late.  
他到底在想什么？这个问题并不陌生。即便这么多年过去了，冬月有时仍觉得难以理解碇，而近来，他心中那挥之不去的疑虑愈发频繁地抬头。

Was it recklessness? Or confidence? Was everything up to this point an extraordinary coincidence? Or was Ikari's work in fact more airtight than it seemed, and that was why nothing had gone majorly wrong yet?  
是鲁莽？还是自信？迄今为止的一切都是非凡的巧合吗？还是说，碇的计划实际上比表面看起来更为严密，所以至今还没有出过什么大错？

His mind would be at peace if he could think it was the latter. Most external observers would be in that camp as well, he wagered. The fact that the council, with their increasingly open suspicions and dissatisfactions, still trusted Ikari to act as their henchman was proof of it. But that kind of blind trust did not come so easily to Fuyutsuki, standing by his side, watching and listening and helping with all the decisions being made. He was keenly aware of how close things got on so many occasions.  
如果他能认为这是后者，他的内心将会平静。他猜测，大多数外部观察者也会持同样看法。尽管委员会成员的怀疑和不满意越来越公开，但他们仍然信任碇来充当他们的打手，这足以证明这一点。但这种盲目的信任对站在他身边、观察、倾听并协助所有决策的冬月来说，并不那么容易获得。他深知在许多场合下，事情是多么接近临界点。

Fuyutsuki cleared his throat.  
冬月清了清喉咙。

"Chairman Kiel called me overnight. He was pretty upset."  
基尔议长昨晚深夜给我打电话。他非常生气。

Ikari's eyes opened. The corners of his mouth slowly turned up contemptuously. He didn't even attempt to hide it.  
碇的双眼睁开了。他的嘴角慢慢扬起，带着轻蔑的笑意。他甚至不打算掩饰这一点。

"Trying to go over my head? That's concerning. Should I prepare for a sudden cabinet reshuffle or some other such nonsense?"  
“试图越过我？这倒是个问题。我是不是该准备迎接内阁的突然重组，或是其他类似的荒唐事？”

"Ah, he did imply that too."  
“啊，他的确也暗示了这一点。”

"What's wrong with the old man this time? Everything is proceeding according to the Scenario."  
"这次老头子又怎么了？一切都在按照剧本进行啊。"

"Losing the dummy system was unexpected. I think they were interested in the logical structure of it, of which you're already aware."  
"失去模拟系统是意料之外的事。我想他们是对其逻辑结构感兴趣，这一点你已经知道了。"

Ikari rose from his seat and walked slowly to the window. The morning sunlight pouring in through the skylight from the Geofront ceiling scattered around his dark form.  
碇源堂从座位上站起身，缓缓走向窗户。从地底都市穹顶洒入的晨光，洒落在他阴暗的身影上。

"You mean he's upset because the thing he sent the spy to steal is gone now."  
"你是说他现在不高兴，因为派间谍去偷的东西不见了。"

"He was hinting that he suspected sabotage on your part. I tried to explain and he relented, but I don't know if he believes me or if he's just pretending to. He kept repeating how the Scenario could never be altered. That was hard to deal with, frankly."  
"他暗示怀疑是你搞的破坏。我尽力解释了，他虽然让步了，但我不确定他是真的相信我还是只是在装样子。他反复强调情景绝不能改变。说实话，这很难应付。"

"The Scenario. Nowhere in the Dead Sea Scrolls is the dummy system directly mentioned. It's no secret that even the Scenario, something the council is treating as if it's from heaven itself, was still doubted by more than half of the council members by the time Reagan became president. If we go all the way back to pre-World War ll..."  
"那个情景。死海古卷中根本没有直接提到假系统。众所周知，即使是那个被议会视为天启的情景，在里根成为总统时，也有超过一半的议员表示怀疑。如果我们追溯到二战前……"

Fuyutsuki snorted. "Kiel was the young maverick. Heretical, even. I know. No need to lecture me on history now, we're too old for that."  
冬月哼了一声。“凯尔是个年轻的叛逆者。甚至可以说是异端。我知道。现在没必要跟我讲历史课，我们都太老了。”

Ikari wasn't wrong; the Dead Sea Scrolls were, like the Delphic oracle, full of metaphors and ambiguous phrases that could be interpreted any number of ways. There were, of course, no specific instructions stating that they should electronically mimic a pilot's consciousness, or that such an artificial intelligence was crucial for achieving Instrumentality. Just a dizzying array of strange rhymes that could mean anything, really. Or nothing at all.  
碇司令说得没错；死海古卷就像德尔斐神谕一样，充满了隐喻和模棱两可的词句，可以有无数种解读方式。当然，并没有具体指示说他们应该电子化模拟驾驶员的意识，或者说这种人工智能对实现人类补完计划至关重要。只有一系列令人眼花缭乱的奇怪韵文，可能意味着任何事情，真的。或者什么都不是。

Fuyutsuki leaned back in his seat. "Why don't you lecture the old man next time? I think there's a good chance he's forgotten a lot of things. He's quite old, after all."  
冬月靠回椅背上。“下次为什么不跟那位老人家讲讲课呢？我觉得他很可能忘记了很多事情。毕竟，他年纪已经很大了。”

"You must want the commandership so badly. I can give it to you if you like, just don't try to get me killed by them."  
"你一定很渴望得到指挥权吧。如果你愿意，我可以给你，只是别试图让他们把我干掉。"

Fuyutsuki smiled bitterly. Ikari paused for a moment before continuing.  
冬月苦笑了一下。碇停顿片刻后继续说道。

"Anyway, they're whining too much lately. What are they even worrying about? The production models with the S2 engine will be fully operational soon."  
"话说回来，他们最近抱怨太多了。到底在担心什么呢？搭载 S2 引擎的生产型号很快就能全面投入使用了。"

Ikari's words reminded Fuyutsuki of what he was thinking moments ago. Poor orphans, to be deceived and used and discarded.  
碇的話語讓冬月想起了片刻之前的思緒。可憐的孤兒們，被欺騙、利用，最終被拋棄。

"Maybe they wanted to reduce our reliance on unethical and ineffective child soldiers. An unmanned weapon would be perfectly predictable and no one would get hurt. Quite a good idea, don't you think?"  
“或許他們想減少我們對不道德且無效的童兵的依賴。無人武器將是完全可預測的，不會有人受傷。這主意不錯，你覺得呢？”

"Well, they were still quick to fill the pilot roster."  
“不過，他們還是很快填補了駕駛員名單。”

"Ah, yeah, that reminds me. What are you going to do about Unit-03? We still haven't picked one for that while filling Unit-04, 05, and 06."  
"啊，对，这让我想起来了。你打算怎么处理三号机？我们在安排四号、五号和六号机的同时，还没为三号机选定驾驶员。"

Ikari's gaze slowly returned to Fuyutsuki.  
碇的目光缓缓回到了冬月身上。

"Of course we'll have to follow the Scenario. We've already irritated the old men enough; if this one goes off the rails too, they'd make us downright miserable."  
"当然，我们必须遵循剧本。我们已经让那些老头子够恼火了；如果这次再出差错，他们会让我们吃不了兜着走。"

Fuyutsuki shrugged. 冬月耸了耸肩。

"Well, of course." “嗯，当然。”

_A preordained betrayal. A despicable foe that would rise from the ranks of the faithful.  
一场预定的背叛。一个卑鄙的敌人，将从忠诚者的行列中崛起。_

Who could possibly know if that line from the Dead Sea Scrolls was in fact directly warning of the Angels that would attack two thousand years in the future? For all any of them knew, it could merely be an allegory for events that occurred in first-century Judea, which was also around the time period the Scrolls themselves were written. After all, there existed a theory that the Book of Revelation was merely a metaphor for the reign of the Roman emperor Nero. Therefore, anything was possible.  
谁能确定死海古卷中的那段话，是否真的直接预示了两千年后天使的袭击？在他们看来，那可能仅仅是公元一世纪犹太地区事件的寓言，而古卷本身也大致写于那个时期。毕竟，有一种理论认为《启示录》只是罗马皇帝尼禄统治的隐喻。因此，一切皆有可能。

But then again, even SEELE's seemingly crackpot interpretation had accurately predicted all the deadly details so far, like the Angels' return. Maybe everything was truly foretold down to the last detail, including the necessity of putting an unsuspecting child inside an Eva that would turn into an enemy the moment it was mobilized. Maybe Fuyutsuki was just an arrogant, overeducated fool who doubted the real prophecy, like the Pharisees of old.  
但话说回来，即便是 SEELE 看似荒谬的解读，迄今为止也准确预言了所有致命细节，比如天使的回归。也许一切真的被预言到了每一个细节，包括将一个无辜的孩子放入 Eva 中，一旦启动就会变成敌人的必要性。或许 Fuyutsuki 只是个傲慢、学识过高的傻瓜，像古代的法利赛人一样怀疑真正的预言。

And frankly, Fuyutsuki was tired of these thought experiments. He did not want to dwell too long on such matters. Doubt was a privilege reserved for the young. If he did it too much, his old mind would not last until the promised time.  
坦白说，Fuyutsuki 厌倦了这些思想实验。他不想在这些事情上过多纠结。怀疑是年轻人的特权。如果他太过频繁地这样做，他那老迈的头脑将无法坚持到约定的时刻。

That was the only thing that mattered to him now. He had come too far to fail, or to give up, or to turn back.  
现在，那唯一的事情对他至关重要。他已经走得太远，不能失败，不能放弃，也不能回头。

Misato didn't say a word as they walked down the hallway, waited for the elevator, and got in. Ritsuko, who had been by her side the entire time, remained silent as well, deep in thought. The only sound echoing in the silent elevator was the click of the floor marker.  
他们沿着走廊走下去，等待电梯，然后进入电梯，美里一句话也没说。一直陪在她身边的律子也保持沉默，深思熟虑。电梯里唯一回响的声音是楼层指示器的咔嗒声。

Misato sighed. Better now than later, she supposed. What an absurd situation she found herself forced into.  
美里叹了口气。她想，现在总比以后好。她被迫陷入的这局面真是荒谬至极。

"Hey, Rits." "嘿，律子。"

Ritsuko didn't move, but their gazes met nonetheless for a brief moment before Ritsuko's slid away again. Misato could see the beginnings of crow's feet forming at the corners of Ritsuko's fatigue-dulled eyes. The other woman looked hollowed out. Exhausted. She and the techs had been under an exceptional workload since the last Angel incursion, more so than what was usual after battles.  
律子没有动，但两人的目光还是短暂地交汇了一瞬，随即律子的视线又移开了。美里能看到律子疲惫的眼角开始出现鱼尾纹的迹象。她看起来像是被掏空了，筋疲力尽。自从上次使徒入侵以来，她和技术人员们一直承受着异常繁重的工作压力，比平时战斗后的情况更为严重。

"You know, the sync test that's scheduled for today..."  
"你知道，今天安排的同步测试……"

Ritsuko's gaze returned to the floor marker. "I can't rig the results or put fake numbers on the report, if that's what you're asking. Don't even think about it."  
律子的目光回到了地板标记上。“我不能篡改结果或是在报告中填上虚假数据，如果你是这么问的话。想都别想。”

A groan escaped Misato's lips. "No, I wasn't about to ask that kind of thing."  
美里发出了一声呻吟。“不，我并没有打算问那种事。”

"Then?" “那么？”

Maybe she should have just pushed Asuka harder this morning instead of buying her bullshit, Misato thought. It would have been much better than begging Ritsuko. The regret was pointless, though. Misato shook her head.  
或许今早她应该更用力地逼迫明日香，而不是买她的账，美里想。这总比求人强。然而，后悔也无济于事。美里摇了摇头。

"Asuka isn't feeling well today. She won't be able to participate in the test."  
“明日香今天身体不适。她无法参加测试。”

Ritsuko's eyes narrowed. Misato could already feel herself cowering at the sight.  
律子的眼神变得锐利。美里已经感觉到自己在那目光下畏缩了。

"Oh? This suddenly? I don't think she ever skipped a sync test before, including when she was in Germany. How sick is she? I'm not willing to accept a simple flu or her period as the reason."  
"哦？这么突然？我不记得她以前跳过同步测试，即使在德国的时候也没有。她病得有多严重？我不接受只是流感或生理期作为理由。"

"It's not a period. I don't know anything more than that. She just started feeling sick this morning. Couldn't even go to school, she said. I haven't checked yet, but I'm pretty sure she ended up skipping school today."  
"不是生理期。我也就知道这么多。她今早开始感觉不舒服。她说连学校都去不了。我还没核实，但我敢肯定她今天没去上学。"

"You didn't feed her curry for dinner or something, did you?"  
"你没给她吃咖喱当晚餐之类的吧？"

Ritsuko's voice was so deadpan it was hard to tell if she was joking or not. It took Misato a breath or two to even understand her words. Then she stomped her foot The elevator shook.  
律子的声音平淡得让人难以分辨她是否在开玩笑。美里花了片刻才理解她的话。随后她跺了跺脚，电梯随之晃动。

"It's not like it's going to kill you! I literally ate that stuff for years...besides, it's Shinji who cooks these days."  
“又不会要了你的命！我可是实实在在地吃了好几年...再说了，现在都是真嗣做饭。”

Misato couldn't see much of Ritsuko's face, but she had a funny feeling she knew what the other woman was thinking anyway. She could feel her face heating up just a little. It felt like she was being interrogated, and she hated that she felt that way. It was all very uncomfortable. This wasn't even her responsibility. Or maybe she was a bit responsible for this whole mess. Partially. At least.  
美里看不清律子的脸，但她有种奇怪的感觉，仿佛知道对方在想什么。她感到自己的脸颊微微发热。这种被审问的感觉让她很讨厌，这一切都让她感到很不舒服。这本不是她的责任。或许她对这团乱麻也有些许责任。至少是部分责任。

"Anyway, I don't think she should be tested today. Could you postpone her test until tomorrow?"  
"总之，我认为她今天不应该接受测试。你能把她的测试推迟到明天吗？"

"Misato, why are you doing this? You should know better. You know how things are done around here. You can't just show up the day of and cancel for what is essentially no reason. Is Asuka the only person that matters here? What about me? What about the Tech Department workflow? You know we already schedule these tests in the late afternoon and make our boys work overtime in order to avoid interfering too much with our pilots' education right? How many more concessions do you expect us to give them? Do you really think I have the ability to just reschedule things on a whim? Well, I don't! We're not even done backing up the data from Matsushiro, and I've got a lot on my plate dealing with the Americans recently. You know all that, right?"  
"美里，你为什么要这么做？你应该更清楚。你知道这里的规矩。你不能在当天突然出现并毫无理由地取消测试。难道这里只有明日香重要吗？那我呢？技术部门的流程怎么办？你知道我们已经在傍晚安排这些测试，并让我们的员工加班，以避免过多干扰飞行员的教育，对吧？你还期望我们给他们多少让步？你真的认为我有能力随意重新安排事情吗？我可没有！我们甚至还没完成松代数据的备份，而且我最近还要处理与美国人的事务。这些你都知道，对吧？"

_Do you even know that I'm going through all this because of you, Asuka?_ Misato forced a smile, swallowing her humiliation.  
你知不知道我为你经历了这一切，明日香？美里强颜欢笑，咽下了她的屈辱。

"Please?" “拜托了？”

Ritsuko paused for a moment and then shut her eyes tightly. "I'll reschedule this week's regular test to tomorrow. Six o'clock."  
律子顿了一下，然后紧紧闭上了眼睛。“我会把这周的常规测试改到明天。六点钟。”

Now Misato was starting to get a little annoyed. There was no possible way that Ritsuko did not know what exactly Misato was really asking for. But she was not in any position to get angry right now.  
现在美里开始有点恼火了。律子不可能不知道美里真正在请求什么。但她现在没有立场发火。

"Eh, you know, that's..."  
"呃，你知道，那是..."

Ritsuko turned her head to face Misato fully for the first time. Her emotionless eyes were suddenly positively brimming with emotion. Misato stuck her tongue out and clasped her hands together in a praying pose. Ritsuko sighed.  
律子第一次完全转向美里。她那原本毫无表情的眼睛突然间充满了情感。美里吐了吐舌头，双手合十做出祈祷的姿势。律子叹了口气。

"Just the two for today's original schedule, then. And Asuka tomorrow. I expect pizza for the poor Tech Department workers who have to do everything twice now for no reason at all."  
"那么，今天的原计划就只有我们两个了。明天是明日香。我希望那些可怜的技术部门员工能吃到披萨，他们现在因为毫无理由地要重复做所有事情而辛苦了。"

Misato breathed a sigh of relief. It felt like a huge stone had been lifted from her chest. There was the matter of the unplanned expense, but well, she'd just have to embezzle a little extra from the ops department's food budget.  
美里松了一口气。感觉像是一块巨石从胸口移开了。虽然还有那笔意外的开销，但没关系，她只需从作战部门的食物预算中稍微挪用一点就行了。

The elevator stopped. It was Ritsuko's floor to get off. Misato smiled sheepishly and waved. Ritsuko responded with a curt nod.  
电梯停了下来。这是律子要下车的楼层。美里尴尬地笑了笑，挥了挥手。律子则冷淡地点头回应。

"What a total princess," Ritsuko muttered lowly, just before exiting.  
“真是个十足的公主。”律子在走出电梯前低声嘀咕道。

Misato decided to pretend she hadn't heard anything.  
美里决定装作什么都没听见。

She also tried to ignore the fact that deep down, she agreed with Ritsuko.  
她同样试图忽视内心深处与律子意见一致的事实。

---

Noon was still an hour away, but the shade-less playground was sweltering. There was even a heat haze visible around the school gate. Not that anyone cared, however.  
正午还有一个小时才到，但无遮无挡的操场已经热得让人窒息。学校大门周围甚至能看到热浪蒸腾。然而，似乎并没有人在意这些。

The boys, running around the field, had no reason to care about anything other than their soccer game. And for Shinji, who was sitting alone in the corner of the bleachers at the opposite end from where the girls were sitting and chatting, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say his soul wasn't here at all. The summer heat barely registered. Right now, his entire world was compressed down into the screen of his phone.  
男孩们在球场上奔跑，除了足球比赛，他们无暇顾及其他。而对于坐在看台另一端角落里的真嗣，远离女孩们闲聊的地方，可以说他的灵魂根本不在这里。夏日的炎热几乎感觉不到。此刻，他的整个世界都浓缩在他手机的屏幕上。

_Asuka, how are you feeling? I've put your breakfast in the fridge. If you're hungry, you can just heat it up. And don't worry about school, I took care of the handouts and notes.  
明日香，你感觉怎么样？我已经把你的早餐放冰箱里了。饿了的话，热一下就可以吃。学校的事不用担心，我已经处理好了讲义和笔记。_

Only after hitting the send button did Shinji realize that he had already sent several texts saying essentially the same thing, the only addition on this occasion being about notes. He quickly hit the cancel button to no avail.  
直到按下发送键，真嗣才意识到自己已经发了好几条内容基本相同的短信，这次只是多提了笔记的事。他迅速按下取消键，却为时已晚。

Shinji sighed and looked at his inbox. Asuka hadn't responded to him yet. Just as she refused to talk to him this morning, refusing even to come out of her room, ignoring Shinji's almost desperate pleas. At least Ms. Misato was able to goad Asuka into saying she wasn't feeling well and that she couldn't eat or go to school or even take the afternoon test. But now that he was at school and there was no guardian to stand in Asuka's doorway and act as the middlewoman, communication between Shinji and Asuka was all but dead.  
真嗣叹了口气，看向自己的收件箱。明日香还没有回复他。就像今早她拒绝和他交谈一样，甚至不愿走出房间，无视真嗣近乎绝望的恳求。至少美里小姐能哄得明日香说她身体不适，不能吃饭、上学，甚至连下午的考试都无法参加。但现在他在学校，没有监护人站在明日香的门口充当调解者，真嗣和明日香之间的交流几乎完全中断了。

_Is this my fault, too?  
这也是我的错吗？_

He wanted to think otherwise, but it wasn't easy. Something must have gone wrong last night. He was already aware of it while they were still…going at it. It was all his fault. And even if it wasn't completely, he knew he definitely wasn't good enough. He must have let her down. He failed.  
他本想否认，但这并不容易。昨晚一定出了什么问题。在他们还在……进行的时候，他就已经意识到了。这都是他的错。即使不完全如此，他也知道自己肯定不够好。他一定让她失望了。他失败了。

_If I wasn't hurt, I could've given Asuka what she wanted. Then none of this would have happened, I bet.  
如果我没受伤，我本可以给明日香她想要的。那样的话，我敢打赌这一切都不会发生。_

The thought made something hot rise in his chest. It wasn't regret or guilt or even lust, but something else. A strangely unpleasant feeling. Shinji didn't want to think about it for too long; to define it clearly, to give it a name, would bring about something he didn't want. What Shinji was feeling now was…  
这个念头让他的胸口涌起一股热流。这不是后悔、内疚，甚至不是欲望，而是别的什么。一种奇怪的不愉快的感觉。真嗣不想长时间思考它；明确地定义它，给它命名，会带来他不想面对的东西。真嗣现在感受到的是……

"Yo, Shinman! Busy talking with Mrs. Ikari, eh?"  
哟，真嗣老大！忙着和碇太太聊天呢，是吧？

Shinji froze. Still, he was able to put up a fight when a hand inevitably reached over his shoulder and grabbed his phone. A brief struggle ensued, but the intruder wasn't that serious about it and soon gave up.  
真嗣僵住了。尽管如此，当一只手不可避免地从他肩膀上伸过来抢走手机时，他还是进行了反抗。短暂的争斗随之而来，但入侵者并不那么认真，很快就放弃了。

The smell of sweat hit Shinji hard as Toji plopped down next to him. Shinji wrinkled his nose, but otherwise said nothing. It wasn't like his friend usually smelled good anyway. Shinji was used to it.  
当托吉一屁股坐在他旁边时，汗水味猛地扑向真嗣。真嗣皱了皱鼻子，但除此之外什么也没说。反正他的朋友平时也不怎么好闻。真嗣已经习惯了。

"What about soccer?" “那足球呢？”

Toji snorted. "It's been over for a while, man."  
冬二哼了一声。“早就结束了，伙计。”

Shinji looked up. Sure enough, the field was almost empty now. Half the boys were gathered around the water fountains, gulping down water, and the other half were streaming into the school building. The girls were already gone, not a single sign of them other than the class rep looking over at them from the edge of the bleachers. Toji waved to her.  
真嗣抬头一看，果然，操场上几乎空无一人。一半的男生围在水龙头旁，大口喝水，另一半则涌进教学楼。女生们早已不见踪影，除了班长在看台边缘向他们这边张望，再无她们的身影。冬二向她挥了挥手。

"Don't worry! I got him!"  
“别担心！我搞定他了！”

The class rep stood still for a moment, then turned and headed toward the main building. Shinji slowly rose to his feet too, letting out a small groan, but Toji raised a hand to stop him.  
班长静静地站了一会儿，然后转身向主楼走去。真嗣慢慢地站起身，发出一声轻微的呻吟，但东治举起手阻止了他。

"What's the hurry? Let's sit for a while."  
“急什么？我们坐一会儿吧。”

With that, Toji leaned back against the upper stair of the bleachers. Shinji sat back down too, since there was nothing else to do now that neither Asuka nor Ayanami were at school.  
说完，东治靠在了看台的上层台阶上。真嗣也坐了回去，既然明日香和绫波都不在学校，现在也没别的事可做。

The grounds quickly became deserted as most of the students returned to the building. The only sounds were the ever-present cicadas and faint voices drifting through the open windows of the school building. Shinji sighed softly and looked up at the sky, then frowned as the sunlight pierced his eyes.  
随着大多数学生返回教学楼，校园很快变得空荡荡的。唯一的声音是始终存在的蝉鸣和从学校建筑敞开的窗户中飘来的微弱人声。真嗣轻轻叹了口气，抬头望向天空，随即因阳光刺眼而皱起了眉头。

It was Toji who broke the brief silence.  
是阿薰打破了短暂的沉默。

"Been a while since we've sat together like this, eh?"  
“我们好久没这样坐在一起了，是吧？”

That was a bit of an exaggeration. It was true that they hadn't seen much of each other lately, both of them busy with their own love affairs, but that didn't mean they literally did not see each other. Of course, it was also true that their after-school hangouts had all but stopped now. So Shinji nodded.  
那有点夸张了。确实，他们最近彼此见面的机会不多，两人都忙于各自的恋情，但这并不意味着他们真的没见过面。当然，他们的放学后聚会几乎已经停止了，这也是事实。所以真嗣点了点头。

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"You know, I was told to keep an eye on you. Didn't need to do that today but it's already become a habit, you see. That's why I came to you now."  
“你知道，有人让我盯着你。今天其实不需要这么做，但已经成了习惯，明白吧。所以我才来找你。”

_Told by who?_ Shinji almost asked, but realized it wasn't necessary. Instead, Shinji said the next thing that came to mind. It was probably an unnecessary question too, but he couldn't help himself.  
谁告诉你的？真嗣几乎要问出口，但又觉得没必要。于是，真嗣说了脑海中浮现的下一个问题。这可能也是个多余的问题，但他忍不住。

"...Why?" "...为什么？"

Toji turned his head toward Shinji and smirked. "Why, to keep an eye on you two so you can't sneak off. You and Soryu are so _interesting_ these days. Hikari probably can't sleep at night, worrying about what you guys might do the next day."  
冬二转向真嗣，嘴角勾起一抹笑。“为什么？当然是为了盯着你们俩，免得你们偷偷溜走。你和惣流最近可真有意思。光子大概晚上都睡不着，担心你们第二天会搞出什么名堂来。”

Shinji stifled a groan. 真嗣强忍住一声叹息。

"This can't be serious." “这不可能当真吧。”

"Who? Me? Hikari?" "谁？我？光？"

"Both!" "两个都是！"

"Hey man, I'm just passing on the word. Hikari's, well..."  
"嘿，伙计，我只是传个话。光嘛，嗯..."

Shinji felt his heart clench in his chest. He did have some idea of the depths to which his reputation had fallen after Asuka's two _slips,_ but it was still a shock to hear the results of them like this. That kind of suspicion was...just too much.  
真嗣感到心在胸口紧缩。他确实对自从明日香两次失误后自己的名声跌至何种地步有些概念，但亲耳听到这样的结果仍让他震惊。那种怀疑...实在是太过分了。

Toji smiled, seeing Shinji's expression.  
看到真嗣的表情，剑介笑了。

"Don't worry. I don't agree with her on that. It's just Hikari overreacting. Worrying is something she's a professional at, you see. You gotta excuse her."  
“别担心。我并不赞同她的看法。只是光子反应过度了。她可是个专业的忧虑者，你懂的。得原谅她。”

Shinji sighed. 真嗣叹了口气。

"You two are already taking turns breaking each other's ribs at home, so why would you even want to bring that crap to school? I wouldn't," said Toji hastily. "I would use school as a chance to take a break and refill my balls if I were you. Heh. Hikari almost slapped me when I said that to her."  
“你们俩在家已经轮流把对方的肋骨都打断了，干嘛还要把这种破事带到学校来？换我可不会，”东治急忙说道，“要是我，就会利用学校的机会休息一下，充充电。嘿。光听到我这么说差点就扇我了。”

Shinji squeezed his eyes shut. "I would've actually slapped you if not for my ribs."  
真嗣闭紧了双眼。“要不是我肋骨还疼，我真会扇你。”

Toji chuckled. Shinji snorted. Silence descended. A breeze cooled his sweaty forehead.  
冬二轻笑一声。真嗣哼了一声。四周陷入寂静。一阵微风拂过，他汗湿的额头感到一丝凉意。

The ensuing silence wasn't that uncomfortable. Until Shinji started to feel like it might be time to go back to the classroom now. But he was able to suppress the anxiety to a manageable level. Perhaps it was because he'd gotten used to interacting with Asuka. Dealing with Asuka was often an emotional rollercoaster and Shinji had been on quite a lot of those lately. The anxiety of being late for class was almost negligible in comparison.  
随后的沉默并不那么令人难受。直到真嗣开始觉得现在可能是时候回教室了。但他能够将这种焦虑压制到可控的程度。也许是因为他已经习惯了与明日香相处。与明日香打交道常常像坐过山车一样情绪起伏，而真嗣最近已经经历了不少这样的时刻。相比之下，上课迟到的焦虑几乎微不足道。

He found himself thinking about Asuka again. The meaning of the things that had happened since yesterday night. Whether or not they were his fault. Whether or not Asuka would think they was his fault or not. And if she did, what he should do about it.  
他发现自己又在想明日香。从昨晚开始发生的事情意味着什么。这些是否是他的错。明日香是否会认为是他的错。如果她这么认为，他又该怎么办。

His mind, which had calmed down a bit after Toji came, started to scatter again.  
在东治到来后稍稍平静下来的思绪，又开始散乱起来。

"So," said Toji. Shinji twitched. ""What's wrong with Mrs. Ikari? A cold? I can't imagine her being sick. Must be very serious if she can't even come to school. Or did you really break her good this time..."  
“所以，”东治说道。真嗣抽搐了一下。“碇太太怎么了？感冒吗？我无法想象她会生病。如果她连学校都来不了，那一定很严重。还是说，这次你真的把她气坏了……”

Shinji gritted his teeth.  
真嗣咬紧了牙关。

"No, she doesn't feel good, that's all."  
"不，她感觉不好，就这些。"

"How badly did you..." "你到底有多..."

"It's not like that!" "不是那样的！"

"You're not choking Mrs. Ikari or something, are you? That sounds pretty dangerous even for you guys. Maybe you should find different kinks."  
"你不是在掐绫波零或者别的什么吧？听起来对你们来说也挺危险的。或许你们应该找点别的癖好。"

"I'm going to choke you," Shinji grumbled, stretching out his hands. Toji barked a laugh and jerked backwards. With a sigh, Shinji sat back down.  
"我要掐你了，" 真嗣咕哝着，伸出手来。冬二大笑一声，猛地向后一缩。真嗣叹了口气，又坐了回去。"

"And what's with that, _Mrs. Ikari?_ Don't call her that."  
"还有，绫波零是怎么回事？别这么叫她。"

Toji chuckled. "Why, you want me to use her full name? Asuka Langley Soryu? Like you do?"  
冬二轻笑道：“怎么，你想让我用她的全名？明日香·兰格雷·惣流？就像你那样？”

That didn't make sense. To Shinji, _Langley_ was something he barely remembered about Asuka, and _Soryu_ was a name he hadn't used for a while. Come to think of it, Shinji had never called Asuka by her full name ever.  
这话让真嗣摸不着头脑。对他来说，兰格雷是关于明日香他几乎记不起来的部分，而惣流则是很久没用过的姓氏。仔细想想，真嗣从未完整地称呼过明日香的全名。

"What does that even mean?"  
“这到底是什么意思？”

Toji lifted a finger and pointed to Shinji's hand, where he was holding his cell phone.  
真嗣举起一根手指，指向了碇的手，他正拿着手机。

"You saved her name as such."  
“你把她的名字存成了这样。”

It took him a moment to understand what he was saying. Shinji realized he saved Asuka's name like that on his phone.  
他花了一会儿才明白他在说什么。真嗣意识到他把明日香的名字存成了那样在手机里。

"Well, because it was a long time ago."  
"嗯，因为那是好久以前的事了。"

It was Asuka's first week in Japan. At school, Asuka held out her cell phone to him, nose high in the air, demanding that they exchange numbers because she didn't think it made sense for pilots to not have each other's contacts in case of an emergency. Shinji saved her full name in his contacts then and hadn't bothered to change it since.  
那是明日香来日本的第一周。在学校，明日香把手机递给他，鼻子翘得老高，要求交换号码，因为她觉得作为驾驶员，万一有紧急情况却联系不上对方，这太不合理了。真嗣当时就把她的全名存进了通讯录，之后也一直没改过。

"That makes sense for then, but now? Shouldn't you change her contact to, like, _My Darling_ or something? What a boyfriend you are. Asuka Langley Soryu my ass."  
"当时那样说得通，但现在呢？你难道不应该把她的联系人名称改成，比如，亲爱的之类的吗？你这男朋友当得真不称职。明日香·兰格雷·索耶？我呸。"

Shinji snorted. "Did you save the class rep's contact as that? Darling?"  
"真嗣哼了一声。“你把班长的联系方式存成这样？亲爱的？””

Toji cleared his throat. "Uh-uh, that's private."  
"托吉清了清喉咙。“呃，这是私人的。””

Shinji chuckled and shrugged. An almost shy smile tugged at his lips, and all the worries that filled his mind were momentarily forgotten.  
真嗣轻笑一声，耸了耸肩。一丝近乎羞涩的微笑牵动着他的嘴角，心中满溢的忧虑在这一刻暂时被遗忘了。

"I didn't know things would become like this back then."  
"那时我真没想到事情会变成这样。"

"Yeah, you and me both. Hikari and Soryu. Who would have thought? It wasn't even that long ago, either. I don't know how things became like this."  
"是啊，你和我都没想到。光和剑。谁会想到呢？也没过多久，我也不知道事情怎么会变成这样。"

"Right." “好的。”

The sounds from the school building had quieted down. Shinji thought he heard the bell ring some time ago. Maybe they should go back now.  
教学楼的声响已经平息下来。真嗣想他之前听到了铃声。也许他们现在应该回去了。

"Hey, Toji..." "嘿，真嗣..."

"Oh yeah, I never told you this, did I?"  
"哦，对了，我好像从没跟你说过这个，是吧？"

"Tell me what?" Shinji looked at Toji from a half-risen position. Toji was staring at the sky with a smile that looked almost timid.  
"告诉我什么？" 真嗣半坐起身，看向东治。东治正微笑着凝视天空，那笑容显得有些腼腆。

"Sometimes I think...you and Soryu contributed a lot to me and Hikari's situation. I'm always grateful for that."  
"有时候我会想...你和 Soryu 对我和 Hikari 的处境贡献良多。我对此总是心怀感激。"

"Contributed how?" "怎么贡献的？"

Toji scratched his head. "You remember how Hikari was the first one to sniff out that something was going on between you two, right?"  
Toji 挠了挠头。“你还记得 Hikari 是第一个察觉到你们俩之间有情况的人吧？”

Shinji let out a small grunt. He'd almost forgotten, but it was true. Back when she visited him when he was suspended. He didn't know if Toji was aware of all the details. He hoped not, but he also knew it was possible. Shinji's impression was that girls didn't hold back amongst themselves, based on the things Asuka had said about herself and Shinji.  
真嗣发出了一声轻微的闷哼。他几乎忘记了，但这确实是真的。在她来看望他被停学的那些日子里。他不知道东治是否知道所有的细节。他希望他不知道，但他也知道这是有可能的。真嗣的印象是，女孩们在彼此之间不会有所保留，基于明日香对自己和真嗣的那些言论。

"Uh... yeah." “呃……是啊。”

"This is just my opinion, but I, I think Hikari started to, you know, take action, partly because of you guys..."  
“这只是我的看法，但我觉得，比方说，光她开始，你知道的，采取行动，部分原因是因为你们……”

"That's ridiculous." "那太荒谬了。"

"Hey, who would know Hikari better? You? Or me? And you know, oh, don't tell anyone but... I think Hikari's a little conscious of Soryu..."  
"嘿，谁更了解光？是你？还是我？而且你知道吗，哦，别告诉任何人，但...我觉得光对惣流有点在意..."

Shinji blinked, unsure of what to say. He couldn't decide if it did or did not make sense. While Shinji was mulling over this surprising revelation, Toji continued.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，不知道该说什么。他无法确定这是否有道理。在真嗣思考这个令人惊讶的发现时，东治继续说道。

"It was the time that something got very strange between you two when she suddenly brought up the lunchbox thing to me. And recently she's been, eh...no, I shouldn't say."  
"就在你们俩之间变得非常奇怪的时候，她突然向我提起了便当的事。而且最近她一直在，呃...不，我不该说。"

Shinji nodded reflexively, not knowing what exactly Toji meant by that. Not that he didn't have some idea, but Shinji didn't want to think about it at all. The idea that the class rep believed every single word of Asuka's bluffs and then, out of some secret rivalry or whatever, she…no, he really didn't want to think about that.  
真嗣下意识地点了点头，不明白东治到底是什么意思。并不是说他没有一些想法，但真嗣根本不想去想这件事。班长相信了明日香所有的虚张声势，然后出于某种秘密的竞争或其他原因，她……不，他真的不想去想这件事。

Shinji felt the need to change the subject. He also had a favor to ask Toji, too.  
真嗣觉得需要换个话题。他也有件事想请东治帮忙。

"Um, Toji?" "呃，东治？"

"Hm?"

"Can I borrow your science textbook? After school, I mean? I'm trying to catch up on the stuff I missed while I was suspended. I think I'm caught up on the other subjects, but science, I'm having trouble with science. I think I need to read more notes and memos..."  
"我能借你的科学课本吗？我是说放学后？我在努力补上被停课期间错过的内容。我觉得其他科目都跟上了，但科学，我在科学上遇到了麻烦。我想我需要多读一些笔记和备忘录..."

Touji snorted. "No problem, but really? You want to borrow mine?"  
东治哼了一声。"没问题，但真的吗？你想借我的？"

"I have no one else to ask... You did take notes, right?"  
"我没有人可以问了...你记笔记了吧？"

"How about asking Soryu?"  
"问问 Soryu 怎么样？"

"She doesn't care about classes."  
"她对课程不感兴趣。"

"But she graduated college, right? Just go to her, open up a book, and ask her to explain the parts you don't understand. Sit down next to each other, you know, shoulder to shoulder and if you get the right answer when she quizzes you, you get a kiss or... ehm."  
"但她不是大学毕业了吗？直接去找她，打开书本，让她解释你不明白的部分。你们可以并肩坐在一起，你知道的，肩并肩，如果她考你时你答对了，就可以得到一个吻或者...呃。"

_We can't do that right now._ "Asuka can't read kanji."  
我们现在不能这么做。""明日香不认识汉字。"

"You think I'm any better?"  
"你以为我又能好到哪儿去？"

Shinji remembered helping Asuka study kanji before. Now that he thought about it, studying wasn't her main concern that day, so maybe she wasn't really paying attention to it in the first place, but even considering that, what Shinji had witnessed that day was…  
真嗣记得曾帮明日香学习汉字。现在想来，那天她的主要目的并非学习，或许她一开始就没怎么认真听，但即便如此，那天他所目睹的情景是……

Shinji shook his head and grimaced. "Yes, actually."  
真嗣摇了摇头，皱起眉头。"是的，确实如此。"

Toji exhaled a surprised sort of laugh. "Geez, that bad, huh. Well, I really don't know, not my concern anyway. I think Hikari wrote most of the notes for me during the week you missed, so I bet that could help ya."  
剑介发出了一声惊讶的笑声。"哎呀，这么糟糕啊。不过，我确实不太清楚，反正也不关我的事。我想那周大部分笔记都是光写的，所以我觉得那些笔记应该能帮到你。"

"She did?" Adding that information to what he just heard, Shinji came to a funny conclusion. He found himself smiling. "She's tutoring you, am I right?"  
"她真的这么做了？" 结合刚刚听到的信息，真嗣得出了一个有趣的结论。他发现自己笑了起来。"她在辅导你，对吧？"

Toji coughed. His cheeks were flushed.  
剑介咳嗽了一声。他的脸颊泛起了红晕。

"What's wrong with that? You don't have to laugh."  
"这有什么不对的？你不必笑我。"

"I wasn't laughing at you."  
“我不是在笑你。”

Toji looked up at the sky with a shy look on his face. They sat like that for a while.  
真嗣带着羞涩的表情抬头望向天空。他们就这样坐了一会儿。

Some minutes passed, and Shinji was about to say that they should really go in now when Toji spoke up again.  
几分钟过去了，真嗣正要说他们现在真的该进去了，这时真嗣再次开口。

"If he was here, you could've just borrowed his. Makes you miss the little bastard, huh."  
"如果他在的话，你本可以借他的。让你想念那个小混蛋了，是吧？"

Shinji said nothing. He felt a slight pull in his throat. He found nothing to say, so he dropped his gaze. An ant was crawling across the cement floor. He couldn't tell if it was on some sort of mission or if it was just going home, if it had a destination at all. It was just a single ant, heading somewhere. For a moment Shinji focused all his attention on it. He didn't want to think of anything else.  
真嗣没有说话。他感到喉咙有些发紧。他找不到任何话可说，于是垂下了目光。一只蚂蚁正沿着水泥地面爬行。他无法分辨它是在执行某种任务，还是只是在回家，或者它是否有目的地。它只是一只蚂蚁，朝着某个方向前进。有那么一会儿，真嗣把全部注意力都集中在它身上。他不想去想其他任何事情。

"You never talked to him after that, have you? Did you get any letters?"  
"那之后你再也没有和他谈过，对吗？你收到过他的信吗？"

_A letter._ Shinji swallowed. _Asuka would never forgive me. And she's right about that._  
一封信。真嗣咽了咽口水。明日香永远不会原谅我了。她那么说没错。

Once again, Shinji felt a weird sensation in his chest. A strangely unpleasant, stuffy feeling. It was almost the same as the one he'd been feeling just moments before Toji came to him.  
又一次，真嗣感到胸口涌起一种奇怪的感觉。一种异常不快的、闷闷的感觉。几乎与他刚才在东治来找他之前所感受到的一模一样。

Shinji shook his head. 真嗣摇了摇头。

"No. Nothing. How about you?"  
“没有。没什么。你呢？”

"Just once. Almost right after he went. About how he was lonely. That he couldn't speak English. Being the only Asian and all that. After that, I didn't hear from him either. I wrote him to not take pictures there or he might get shot. Maybe he didn't like that, heh. Oh, I still have his address, though. You want me to..."  
"就一次。几乎是他刚走之后。关于他有多孤独。说他不会说英语。作为唯一的亚洲人，诸如此类的事。之后，我也没再收到他的消息。我写信告诉他不要在那里拍照，否则可能会被枪击。也许他不喜欢那样，呵呵。哦，不过我还有他的地址。你要我……"

Shinji stood up. The bottom of his sneaker scraped over where the ant was. Without realizing it, Shinji scraped his sole against the same place several times.  
真嗣站了起来。他的运动鞋底刮过了蚂蚁所在的地方。不知不觉中，真嗣的鞋底在同一个地方摩擦了几次。

"Let's go. Class must have started by now."  
"我们走吧。现在课应该已经开始了。"

The corner of Toji's mouth twitched slightly as he looked up at Shinji's face, seeing something there. An awkward smile followed.  
当 Toji 抬头看向 Shinji 的脸时，嘴角微微抽动，似乎在那张脸上看到了什么。随后露出了一个尴尬的微笑。

"Yeah." "嗯。"

---

It was around eight o'clock when Shinji came home. Or nine. Asuka could deduce from the sounds she heard that Shinji had arrived and that Misato had not accompanied him. She had no way of knowing the exact time. She couldn't see the clock in the darkness of the room, and her cell phone was nowhere to be seen.  
Shinji 回到家时大约是八点钟，也可能是九点。Asuka 从听到的声音推断出 Shinji 已经回来了，而 Misato 并没有陪同他。她无法确切知道时间，因为在房间的黑暗中她看不见时钟，手机也不知所踪。

Soon she heard rattling from the kitchen. He must have started to wash the dishes even before setting foot in his room. Dishes Asuka had stuck in the sink over the course of the whole day.  
很快，她听到厨房传来叮叮当当的声音。他甚至在踏进自己房间之前就开始洗碗了。那些是 Asuka 一整天下来堆积在水槽里的碗碟。

Asuka felt a little guilty. Back when she finished lunch, she figured she could just do them later. When she added the dishes from dinner to the pile, she figured she still had some time before Shinji and Misato came back.  
明日香感到有些内疚。午饭后，她本以为可以稍后再洗碗。当她把晚餐的碗碟也堆在一起时，她想着新二和美里回来之前还有些时间。

And now that Shinji was back and doing the dishes for her, Asuka realized in retrospect that a part of her had wished for exactly this.  
而现在，新二回来了，正在为她洗碗，明日香事后才意识到，她内心的一部分确实希望如此。

Asuka hated it and hated thinking about why she hated it even more. Fueled by anger, Asuka pushed herself out of bed. It was the first time she'd done so since she'd walked into her room and laid down immediately after dinner.  
明日香讨厌这样，更讨厌去思考自己为何如此厌恶。愤怒驱使她从床上起身。这是自晚餐后她走进房间立即躺下以来的第一次。

But then she paused with her hand on the door. Truthfully, the last thing she wanted to do right now was go out and face Shinji. She wanted to put that off for as long as she could. She knew she would eventually have to deal with him, probably today, but right now she didn't feel ready.  
但她的手放在门上时却停住了。说实话，她现在最不想做的事就是出去面对真嗣。她想尽可能地拖延这件事。她知道最终还是得处理和他的关系，很可能就是今天，但此刻她觉得自己还没准备好。

Ready. That reminded her. She lifted her arm and sniffed. Asuka hadn't washed since last night. It didn't smell too bad, but that was probably because she locked herself in a small room almost all day and she'd gotten used to her own smell. And she knew it'd be a horror show down there, to say the least.  
准备好。这让她想起来了。她抬起手臂嗅了嗅。明日香从昨晚起就没洗过澡。味道不算太糟，可能是因为她几乎一整天都把自己关在狭小的房间里，习惯了自身的气味。但她知道，楼下至少会是一片混乱。

Deciding to take a shower now and think about other things later, Asuka left the room. The sounds from the kitchen had stopped, making Asuka worried.  
决定先洗个澡，稍后再考虑其他事情，明日香离开了房间。厨房的声响已经停止，这让明日香感到担忧。

_Thought I could sneak past him. Is he already done?  
以为能偷偷溜过他身边。他已经做完了吗？_

Asuka poked her head toward the kitchen. The sight made her heart stop. Shinji, still in his school uniform, rubber gloves on both hands, stood at the sink with his head down, doing nothing.  
明日香探头望向厨房。眼前的景象让她心头一紧。真嗣还穿着校服，双手戴着橡胶手套，站在水槽前低着头，一动不动。

_So down. I made him like that.  
如此消沉。是我让他变成这样的。_

Then her face twisted. 然后她的脸扭曲了。

_What could possibly be so depressing to you, huh? You are the super-elite pilot, the one who reduced a veteran like me to nothing. I'm scared of even simple sync tests now, and it's all because of you!  
对你来说，有什么可能如此令人沮丧呢？你是超级精英驾驶员，那个让我这样的老手变得一无是处的人。我现在连简单的同步测试都害怕，这一切都是因为你！_

Asuka suppressed the mean voice in her head. She was being such an ungrateful bitch to the boyfriend who did everything she asked for. She liked him, she even confessed it to him. And yesterday they did... the closest thing to sex they'd ever done. Because she wanted to.  
明日香压抑住脑海中刻薄的声音。她对那个为她做了一切的男朋友如此忘恩负义。她喜欢他，甚至向他表白了。昨天他们还做了...他们迄今为止最接近性行为的事情。因为她想要。

_And then I felt so, so bad. I couldn't even look at Shinji's face after cumming, so I made him feel even worse by ignoring him all day.  
然后我感到非常非常糟糕。射精后我甚至不敢看真嗣的脸，所以我整天不理他，让他感觉更糟。_

It felt so ironic. That things became this awkward after what was supposed to be their happiest moment. To the point she couldn't even look at him.  
这感觉太讽刺了。本应是他们最幸福的时刻之后，事情变得如此尴尬，以至于她甚至无法直视他。

_I should've waited until he got better. If we could have done it right, none of this would've happened. Hell, we'd still be in bed right now, both of us skipping school. I heard that kind of thing happens with first time lovers. I screwed it all up.  
我应该等到他好些再说的。如果我们能做得对，这一切都不会发生。见鬼，我们现在还会躺在床上，两个人都逃课。我听说第一次恋爱的情侣会这样。我把一切都搞砸了。_

As if he heard her thoughts, Shinji slowly turned his head to look at her. Asuka's shoulders stiffened as she met his blank eyes. Shinji blinked, saying nothing, as if this was unexpected to him, too.  
仿佛听见了她的心声，真嗣缓缓转过头来看着她。明日香的双肩一僵，迎上了他空洞的眼神。真嗣眨了眨眼，一言不发，似乎这对他来说也是意料之外。

_I'm sorry I made you feel bad. You didn't do anything wrong. I like you. You make me happy. I don't want to be without you. I don't want to be hated by you. Yesterday, you gave me everything I demanded, and I took it but ignored your needs. If you want me to, I could…right now...  
对不起，让你感到难过。你没做错什么。我喜欢你。你让我开心。我不想失去你。我不想被你讨厌。昨天，你给了我所有我要求的，我接受了却忽视了你的需求。如果你愿意，我可以……现在就……_

_It's all your fault. I hate you. I wouldn't be like this if it weren't for you. You threaten me. And what makes it worse is that you're doing it without even realizing or trying. I can't count the number of times that I've wished you never existed, and that's just for today.  
都是你的错。我恨你。如果不是因为你，我不会变成这样。你威胁我。更糟糕的是，你这样做甚至没有意识到或尝试。我数不清有多少次希望你从未存在过，而这仅仅是今天。_

It was as if the two voices were fighting for control of her mouth. Asuka didn't dare say anything for fear of which might come out. As she tried to stand still, her lips twitching slightly, Shinji spoke up first, smiling awkwardly.  
仿佛两股声音在争夺她嘴巴的控制权。明日香不敢开口，生怕会说出什么不该说的。她试图保持镇定，嘴唇却微微抽搐，这时真嗣先开了口，尴尬地笑了笑。

"Hi."

_Hi_. The safest, most neutral way to start the conversation. It was obvious that Shinji was feeling as much pressure as Asuka. It made Asuka feel both apologetic and annoyed at the same time. She didn't know what Shinji could have done differently, though. Maybe it was an impossible task.  
嗨。这是开启对话最安全、最中性的方式。显然，真嗣感受到的压力不亚于明日香。这让明日香既感到抱歉又觉得恼火。她不知道真嗣还能怎么做，或许这本就是个不可能完成的任务。

"Hi."

Asuka couldn't think of anything better to say either. Shinji's smile was still awkward.  
明日香也想不出更好的话来回应。真嗣的笑容依旧尴尬。

"I thought you were sleeping. You didn't answer my texts either...have you seen the doctor? How are you feeling?"  
"我以为你在睡觉。你也没回我短信...你去看医生了吗？感觉怎么样？"

_I wasn't sick. I just made it up because I didn't want to do anything, because I didn't want to go to the test_. "It's okay. I'm fine now. I didn't have to go to the hospital or anything. Where's Misato?"  
我没生病。我只是编了个借口，因为我不想做任何事，不想去考试。“没事了。我现在很好。也没必要去医院什么的。美里呢？”

"She'll be late." “她会迟到的。”

"Huh." "嗯。"

She almost asked about his test, but didn't. What would she do with the knowledge anyway? And she didn't want to expose her interest in that to him.  
她差点问起他的考试，但终究没问出口。知道这些又能如何呢？况且她也不想让他察觉自己对此事的关注。

Shinji tried to say something, but Asuka spoke first. "I'm going to take a shower. I feel disgusting after lying around all day."  
真嗣本想开口说些什么，但明日香抢先了一步。“我要去洗个澡。躺了一整天，感觉浑身难受。”

Shinji looked thoughtful for a moment. Just as Asuka began to wonder what he was thinking, he nodded. Asuka felt a pang of frustration, as if there was something more she could have said but didn't. Shinji turned his gaze toward the table and stood still. Only the noise from the refrigerator fan filled the uneasy air, vibrating in Asuka's eardrums. With difficulty, Asuka at last tore her eyes away from her boyfriend and headed for the restroom.  
真嗣若有所思地沉默了一会儿。正当明日香开始好奇他在想什么时，他点了点头。明日香感到一阵懊恼，仿佛还有什么话没说出口。真嗣将目光转向桌子，静静地站在那里。只有冰箱风扇的嗡嗡声填满了不安的空气，震动着明日香的耳膜。费了好大劲，明日香终于移开了视线，朝洗手间走去。

When she got out of the shower, the light in the kitchen was off and the entire apartment was dark. The moonlight was weak tonight, apparently, so the only source of light was a faint yellow glow leaking through the closed door of Shinji's room. Asuka made her way back to her own room.  
当她洗完澡出来时，厨房的灯已经熄了，整个公寓一片漆黑。今晚的月光似乎很微弱，唯一的光源是从真嗣房间紧闭的门缝中透出的微弱黄光。明日香摸索着回到了自己的房间。

It wasn't until she untied her hair towel that Asuka realized something she'd forgotten: everything she needed for her post-shower routine was in Shinji's room. The blow dryer, heat protectant, lotion and everything. She'd moved them over one by one over the past few days.  
直到她解开头发的毛巾，明日香才意识到自己忘了件事：她洗完澡后需要的一切都在真嗣的房间里。吹风机、热保护喷雾、乳液等等。过去几天里，她一样样地把它们搬了过去。

_Maybe I should just sleep.  
也许我应该直接睡觉。_

But she did not like the sound of that. She didn't want to skip her routine, but she wasn't even sure if sleeping alone again was part of her plan in the first place. As with so many other things, she had procrastinated and pushed back on deciding what to do tonight.  
但她并不喜欢这个声音。她不想打破自己的日常，但她甚至不确定独自入睡是否原本就在她的计划之中。就像许多其他事情一样，她拖延着，推迟了决定今晚该做什么。

Sighing, Asuka turned her attention to her bed and realized that even her cell phone, which she usually threw on her bed, was in Shinji's room. With a small groan, Asuka turned and left.  
叹了口气，明日香将注意力转向她的床，意识到就连她通常会扔在床上的手机也在真嗣的房间里。明日香轻声呻吟了一下，转身离开了。

Maybe this was the best kind of excuse to go back to Shinji's room and face him again, even if she couldn't quite figure out what to do or even organize her thoughts and feelings.  
也许这是回到真嗣房间再次面对他的最好借口，即使她无法完全理清该做什么，甚至无法整理自己的思绪和情感。

Asuka's hand as she opened the door to Shinji's room was much rougher than she intended. The scraping noise of it made her flinch.  
明日香推开真嗣房间门的手比她预想的要粗暴得多。门板摩擦的刺耳声让她不禁一颤。

Shinji was sitting at his desk, a book and a notebook open in front of him. There was a brief flicker of surprise in his eyes when they flicked to hers, but then his trademark impassive expression returned. There was a time when Asuka thought of it as irrefutable evidence of a dull, boring personality. She knew better now. She knew it was a defense mechanism, and she felt both sick and angry that her presence was the thing triggering it. Still, she was aware that she had to be patient and cautious here, so she spoke in an almost casual tone.  
真嗣坐在书桌前，面前摊开着一本书和一个笔记本。当他的目光转向她时，眼中闪过一丝惊讶，但随即又恢复了那标志性的无动于衷的表情。曾经，明日香认为这是他性格沉闷无趣的铁证。如今她已明白，这不过是一种防御机制，而她的出现竟成了触发这一机制的诱因，这让她既感恶心又愤怒。尽管如此，她深知在此必须保持耐心和谨慎，于是她用近乎随意的语气说道。

"I'm going to dry my hair. It's going to be noisy. Is that okay?"  
“我去吹干头发，会有点吵。可以吗？”

Shinji blinked a few times before turning his eyes to Asuka's things, clustered in a corner of the room. Asuka closed the door and stepped into the room after he nodded.  
真嗣眨了几下眼睛，然后将目光转向房间角落里阿斯卡的东西。阿斯卡关上门，在他点头后走进了房间。

Her hair was not in the best shape despite all the care she put into it, so she carefully smoothed heat protectant all over her hair before blow drying it. That was a much more time-consuming process than what boys did with their hair.  
尽管她对头发呵护备至，但发质并不理想，所以她小心翼翼地在头发上涂抹热保护剂，然后才开始吹干。这个过程比男孩子们打理头发要耗时得多。

But in the long minutes that passed, Shinji never once looked her way. The way he kept flipping through the pages of the book despite her proximity reminded her of that time at the swimming pool.  
但在漫长的几分钟里，真嗣从未向她这边看一眼。尽管她就在附近，他却一直翻阅着书页，这让她想起了在游泳池的那次经历。

_Would he turn around if I got naked?  
如果我脱光了，他会回头吗？_

Asuka opened the lotion cap, deliberately making as much noise as possible. Shinji's shoulders twitched slightly in surprise, but he still didn't turn around. As she started to unwrap the bath towel, Asuka suddenly felt pathetic.. She'd clung to Shinji yesterday for comfort, only to feel empty and push him away, and then back to clinging to him. And she couldn't even do that right, satelliting around him like a shy girl, waiting for him to notice her.  
明日香打开防晒霜的盖子，故意发出尽可能大的声响。真嗣的肩膀微微一颤，显得有些惊讶，但他依然没有转身。当她开始解开浴巾时，明日香突然感到一阵悲哀。昨天她为了寻求安慰而紧贴着真嗣，却感到空虚并推开了他，然后又再次依偎过去。而她甚至无法正确地做到这一点，像个害羞的女孩一样在他周围徘徊，等待他注意到自己。

_Look at me! 看着我！_

Asuka bit her lip. 明日香咬了咬嘴唇。

_I'm not afraid of him. I haven't done anything wrong. I don't need his attention right now, but if I want it, I can just take it for myself. There's no reason to act like this.  
我不怕他。我什么坏事都没做。我现在不需要他的关注，但如果我想要，我自己就能得到。没必要这样表现。_

Asuka closed the lotion bottle and stood up. She only had to take a single step to get from Shinji's bed to Shinji's desk.  
明日香合上乳液瓶，站起身来。她只需跨出一步，就能从真嗣的床边走到真嗣的书桌旁。

"What are you reading?" “你在看什么？”

She kept her tone light and sweet, leaning down and sweeping a lock of hair behind her ear. That kind of trick always worked wonders with this boy, and sure enough, Shinji's gaze returned to her. But Asuka didn't have the chance to feel the thrill that usually came with it. Because something in the book he was reading caught her eyes.  
她保持着轻松甜美的语调，俯身将一缕发丝掠至耳后。这种小伎俩对这个男孩总是屡试不爽，果不其然，真嗣的目光重新回到了她身上。但明日香并未感受到往常随之而来的兴奋。因为他正在阅读的那本书吸引了她的目光。

"...What is this?" “……这是什么？”

Shinji's eyes, previously fixed on Asuka's collarbones, blinked rapidly before the light returned to them. "Science textbook. Why?"  
真嗣的目光原本停留在明日香的锁骨上，快速眨了几下眼后，眼神恢复了清明。“科学教科书。怎么了？”

_Are you being intentionally obtuse?_ "I'm aware of that. What I want to know is whose book is this."  
你是故意装糊涂吗？“我知道这个。我想知道的是这本书是谁的。”

Asuka pointed at the book. She didn't need to read the words to know that it was a science textbook. All the diagrams interspersed throughout the paragraphs were enough to deduce it. What caught Asuka's attention now were the notes scribbled in the margins between paragraphs and the underlining scattered throughout. They were oddly…  
明日香指着那本书。她不需要读文字就知道那是一本科学教科书。段落中穿插的所有图表足以推断出来。现在引起明日香注意的是段落之间空白处潦草的笔记和散布各处的下划线。这些笔记出奇地……

"Oh, it's Toji's. I borrowed his for the notes I missed."  
“哦，是真嗣的。我借了他的书来补上我错过的笔记。”

Something began to boil inside Asuka. "...Why are you lying to me? Just tell me whose it is."  
某种情绪在明日香内心沸腾。“……你为什么要对我撒谎？直接告诉我这是谁的。”

Confusion was palpable in Shinji's face. It looked so innocent that a small alarm began to ring in Asuka's mind, that he couldn't possibly be this good at lying, that she might be making a mistake. But it was short-lived. The things she could see in the open book in front of them: ink in four different colors, carefully-drawn, ruler-straight lines, neat handwriting that looked like it could have been printed, and cute punctuation marks - none of those could possibly have been the work of that Suzuhara monkey. It was the work of a girl, there was no doubt about that.  
真嗣脸上的困惑显而易见。那表情如此无辜，以至于明日香心中响起了一丝警报，他不可能如此擅长撒谎，她可能犯了个错误。但这种感觉转瞬即逝。她眼前摊开的书本上那些显而易见的事实：四种颜色的墨水，精心绘制的直尺线条，整洁得仿佛印刷出来的字迹，以及可爱的标点符号——这些都不可能是铃原那只猴子的手笔。这无疑是出自一个女孩之手，这一点毋庸置疑。

If Shinji had come up with any other name, Asuka might have been convinced. But Suzuhara? The brazen lie angered her and made her become suspicious of Shinji's intentions. He wouldn't lie to her for no reason, after all.  
如果真嗣说出其他任何名字，明日香或许会被说服。但铃原？这个明目张胆的谎言激怒了她，并让她对真嗣的意图产生了怀疑。毕竟，他不会无缘无故地对她撒谎。

_Whatever this was, it wasn't Shinji's idea._ Asuka gritted her teeth and tried to control her anger by thinking so. One of those bitches must have told him something about keeping it a secret or something, and Shinji was naive enough to buy it. It wasn't his fault, but he shouldn't have lied to her.  
无论这是什么，都不是真嗣的主意。明日香咬紧牙关，试图通过这样想来控制自己的愤怒。那些婊子中的一个肯定告诉了他什么关于保密的事情，而真嗣又天真到会相信。这不是他的错，但他不应该对她撒谎。

She leaned down closer to him. "It's okay," she gritted out through clenched teeth. "Just tell me while you still have a chance."  
她俯身更靠近他。“没关系，”她咬牙切齿地说，“趁还有机会，快告诉我。”

Asuka's shadow half covered Shinji's face. He looked up at Asuka with his mouth slightly open. A silent confrontation ensued. Shinji didn't back down or cower in the slightest, and that surprised Asuka a little. If anything, it was Asuka who cowered a bit when something sharp flashed in Shinji's eyes.  
明日香的影子半遮住了真嗣的脸。他微微张着嘴抬头看着明日香。一场无声的对峙开始了。真嗣丝毫没有退缩或畏缩，这让明日香有点惊讶。如果说有什么变化，反倒是明日香在真嗣眼中闪过一丝锐利时稍稍退缩了。

"What am I supposed to tell you, Asuka? This is Toji's. I borrowed it from him."  
"我该告诉你什么，明日香？这是真嗣的。我向他借的。"

The barely concealed irritation in his voice, coupled with the fact that she'd just flinched at the look in his eyes, fueled Asuka's defiance and anger, something that was second nature to her. Pointing at the book, Asuka shoved her face right into Shinji's, invading his personal space.  
他声音中隐约的恼怒，加上她刚才因他眼神而退缩的事实，点燃了明日香的反抗和怒火，这对她来说几乎是本能。明日香指着书，将脸猛地凑近真嗣，侵入了他的私人空间。

"Don't be ridiculous! Are you telling me Suzuhara wrote those? You think I'm stupid? Who's the girl?! The stupid whore bitch?! I bet it's not the First, so who is it? Who came to you and said, _Ikari~? I heard you're having trouble keeping up with the class~! You want to borrow my textbook~? Oh, don't tell Soryu about this~!_ Who was it?! And you, why did you even accept that?! I always knew you were an idiot, but are you seriously _that_ clueless?"  
"别荒唐了！你是说铃原写的那些？你以为我傻吗？那个女孩是谁？！那个愚蠢的婊子？！我打赌不是初号机，那是谁？是谁来找你，说，真嗣~？我听说你跟不上课程了~！你想借我的课本~？哦，别告诉惣流这件事~！是谁？！还有你，为什么要接受那个？！我一直知道你是个笨蛋，但你真的那么无知吗？"

Despite the awareness that she might regret this if she kept on, despite the feeling that her voice was becoming dangerously watery, Asuka couldn't stop herself, and ended up giving voice to the fears she wanted to hide.  
尽管她意识到如果继续下去可能会后悔，尽管她感觉到自己的声音变得危险地哽咽，但明日香无法控制自己，最终还是说出了她想要隐藏的恐惧。

"I take my eyes off you for a single day and you..." _Stop. Stop right now._ "Is it because of yesterday? Is it because I refused to talk to you today?"  
“我不过一天没看住你，你就……”停下。立刻停下。“是因为昨天吗？是因为我今天拒绝和你说话吗？”

Shinji's eyes narrowed. Several expressions, each more incomprehensible than the last, flickered across his face, making her uneasy. By the time Shinji opened his mouth, Asuka was already regretting this whole encounter.  
真嗣的眼睛眯了起来。他脸上闪过几种表情，一个比一个难以理解，让她感到不安。等到真嗣开口时，明日香已经开始后悔这次遭遇了。

"Asuka, what are you talking about? This is Toji's book. And the notes, well, most of them look like that because Class Rep wrote them for him..."  
"明日香，你在说什么呢？这是真嗣的书。那些笔记嘛，大部分看起来那样是因为班长帮他写的……"

_Ah_. Asuka's combat senses warned her that defeat was imminent. The unexpected introduction of a new and totally unforeseen element was disconcerting. But then again, why didn't this possibility occur to her? Why did she jump straight to the worst possible option? The dawning sense that she truly might have made a mistake made her heart race. She wondered if she should try to find a way to salvage this situation somehow, but her pride wouldn't allow her to back down after coming this far.  
啊。明日香的战斗直觉警告她，失败已迫在眉睫。这个突如其来的、完全出乎意料的新元素令人不安。但话说回来，为什么她没有想到这种可能性？为什么她直接跳到了最坏的可能选项？意识到自己可能真的犯了一个错误，她的心跳加速了。她想知道是否应该设法挽救这个局面，但她的骄傲不允许她在走到这一步后退缩。

"What a convoluted story. You should start writing novels."  
"多么曲折的故事。你应该开始写小说了。"

Shinji closed the book, so quickly and suddenly that the resulting clap seemed to echo in the room. Asuka unconsciously took half a step back. Shinji's finger pointed to the corner of the book cover.  
真嗣合上书本，动作快而突兀，以至于那声响仿佛在房间里回荡。明日香不由自主地后退了半步。真嗣的手指指向书封的一角。

"There's his name there. Are you going to tell me I made this up too?"  
“那里有他的名字。你是不是也要说我连这也编造了？”

Asuka frowned. She didn't have much trouble with katakana and hiragana now, the only exceptions being a few weirdly similar signs, but the name written there was in kanji.  
明日香皱起眉头。她现在对片假名和平假名已经没什么困难了，除了几个看起来异常相似的符号，但那上面写的名字却是用汉字。

_How do you read that? Does it really say Suzuhara? Or is he bluffing because he knows I can't read it anyway?  
你怎么读的？真的写着铃原吗？还是他在虚张声势，因为他知道我反正也看不懂？_

Asuka was dangerously close to tears now. She shuddered with humiliation as Shinji flicked the book with his fingers as if in triumph.  
明日香现在几乎要哭出来了。她因屈辱而颤抖，而真嗣用手指弹了弹书，仿佛在庆祝胜利。

"Are you done now, Asuka?"  
“你完了吗，明日香？”

With that, silence descended. Asuka stood still, staring at the desk, unable to think of anything to say. Shinji didn't say anything either.  
话音刚落，寂静便笼罩了四周。明日香静静地站着，凝视着桌子，想不出该说什么。真嗣也没有开口。

Asuka was aware that Shinji was not going to reach out to her, or do anything that would somehow neutralize the situation. After an unbearably miserable and humiliating second, Asuka looked up. Shinji's face remained impassive, and that made Asuka's temper flare.  
明日香知道真嗣不会向她伸出援手，也不会做任何能缓和局势的事。在一段难以忍受的痛苦和屈辱之后，明日香抬起头。真嗣的面容依旧冷漠，这让明日香的情绪更加激动。

"You're thinking I'm pathetic, right? Literally illiterate. An idiot that thirsts over you like a bitch in heat. Who gets jealous at nothing. Who picks stupid fights. Who trained her whole life only to still get beaten by a newbie. I bet you secretly despise me."  
“你一定觉得我很可悲吧？简直就是文盲。一个像发情母狗一样对你垂涎欲滴的白痴。无端嫉妒，挑起愚蠢的争斗。我一生都在训练，结果还是被新手打败。我猜你心里一定在偷偷鄙视我。”

_Tell me that's not true. Tell me again how you live only for me. Hug me. Kiss me.  
告诉我那不是真的。再次告诉我你只为而活。拥抱我。亲吻我。_

_No, I don't need that. I hate you. I can't believe I've become like this. It's all because of you. I'm sick of this whole situation.  
不，我不需要那个。我恨你。我无法相信自己变成了这样。这一切都是因为你。我受够了这种局面。_

Once again, Shinji didn't live up to Asuka's expectations.  
又一次，真嗣没有达到明日香期望。

Instead, he bit his lip tightly and looked away. His hand shot out and snatched the textbook. By the time Asuka realized what was happening, the poor book was already flying at the door, leaving only a blurry afterimage behind it. The door shook as if it were about to be thrown out of its frame. Then the book fell to the floor with a heavy thud.  
相反，他紧紧咬住嘴唇，别过头去。手猛地一伸，夺过课本。等到明日香意识到发生了什么时，那本可怜的书已经朝着门飞去，只留下一道模糊的残影。门板颤动，仿佛随时会被甩出框架。随后，书重重地摔在地上，发出沉闷的声响。

Asuka realized she was completely frozen. She didn't even dare to breathe. She also realized this was the first time Shinji had ever shown anything resembling violence in front of her.  
明日香意识到自己完全僵住了。她甚至不敢呼吸。她也意识到，这是真嗣第一次在她面前表现出类似暴力的行为。

They say that just before a tsunami hits, there is an ebb in the tide, and that was what Asuka was feeling right now, a black tide of rage crashing into the void where she had been feeling nothing but shock.  
据说海啸来袭前，潮水会先退去，而此刻明日香感受到的正是如此，一股黑色的愤怒浪潮涌入她原本只感到震惊的虚无之中。

_How dare you try to intimidate me?! You can't even stand up quickly, let alone satisfy your girlfriend who took off her panties for you in your bed. You're not even a man.  
你怎么敢试图恐吓我？！你连快速站起来都做不到，更别提满足那个在你床上为你脱下内裤的女朋友了。你根本算不上一个男人。_

Asuka's throat burned. Distantly, a voice was asking if that was really it, if she was blaming her sexual frustration on him now, but she paid it no heed.  
明日香的喉咙火辣辣的。隐约间，有个声音在问那是否真的就是全部，她是否现在把性压抑归咎于他，但她对此置若罔闻。

Before she could grab Shinji and do anything to him, he slumped in his seat and his hands came up to cover his face. A whisper escaped between his fingers.  
在她能抓住真嗣并对他做任何事之前，他瘫坐在座位上，双手捂住了脸。指缝间漏出一声低语。

"Asuka... today's test... I'm barely above the operational limit... lower than Ayanami. Worse than the first day I came here, they told me. Are you satisfied now...?"  
"明日香...今天的测试...我勉强超过了操作极限...比绫波还低。比我第一天来这里时他们告诉我的还要糟糕。你现在满意了吗...？"

Asuka's inside went cold, as quickly as they had heated up. She didn't know what to say, or how to act. She licked her lips. They were dry as sandpaper. Shinji's breathing, high and sharp, echoed in the room.  
明日香内心一凉，如同之前的热度迅速消退。她不知道该说什么，也不知道该如何行动。她舔了舔嘴唇，干得像砂纸一样。真嗣急促而尖锐的呼吸声在房间里回荡。

Asuka grabbed her cell phone off the bed and hurried out of Shinji's room.  
明日香从床上抓起手机，匆匆离开了真嗣的房间。

In her room, dark and stuffy, Asuka lay with her face buried in her pillow. It was the same position she'd spent most of today in. Shinji's return hadn't changed anything. No, everything had gotten worse. And with that, Asuka realized that she'd been hoping Shinji would make her mood better, the same expectation that wasn't met yesterday. She was such a fool.  
在她的房间里，昏暗而闷热，明日香把脸埋在枕头里躺着。她今天大部分时间都是这样度过的。真嗣的归来并没有改变什么。不，一切变得更糟了。想到这里，明日香意识到自己曾希望真嗣能让她的心情好转，就像昨天未曾实现的期待一样。她真是太傻了。

She pounded her bed in frustration and anger, but it didn't make her feel any better. Between clenched teeth, she let out a sound somewhere between a scream and a moan.  
她愤怒地捶打着床铺，但这并没有让她感觉好一点。她紧咬着牙关，发出一种介于尖叫和呻吟之间的声音。

Some time had passed when she heard the sound of the door outside. Misato was home, finally.  
过了一段时间，她听到了门外传来的声音。美里终于回家了。

"I'm home - is everyone asleep already?"  
"我回来了——大家都睡了吗？"

The cheerful voice sounded so fake to Asuka's ears. What could possibly be cheerful about this house and its inhabitants right now? Misato had done nothing but annoy her lately, so Asuka didn't want to see her face. As the footsteps stopped at the door to her room, Asuka buried her face completely in her pillow and pretended to be asleep. Soon there was a knock, just as Asuka had expected, and the door opened slightly.  
那欢快的声音在明日香听来如此虚假。此刻这房子和它的居住者有什么值得高兴的呢？美里最近除了惹她生气什么都没做，所以明日香不想见到她的脸。当脚步声停在她的房门口时，明日香将脸完全埋进枕头里，假装已经睡着。不久，正如明日香所预料的那样，传来了敲门声，门轻轻地开了。

"Asuka, are you asleep? How are you feeling?"  
"明日香，你睡着了吗？感觉怎么样？"

Asuka didn't move. She knew that she was still wrapped in a bath towel and lying face down above the futon, so Misato probably wouldn't buy it. But Asuka was in no mood to deal with her guardian right now, so she stubbornly kept pretending.  
明日香没有动。她知道自己还裹着浴巾，脸朝下躺在被褥上，所以美里大概不会相信。但明日香现在没心情应付她的监护人，所以她固执地继续假装。

Soon, with a dull thud, the door closed again.  
很快，随着一声沉闷的砰响，门再次关上了。

Two footsteps, then the same question, a knock, the sound of a door opening, and closing. Shinji must have fallen asleep. Or he was doing the same thing as Asuka.  
两声脚步，接着是同样的问题，敲门声，开门声，关门声。真嗣一定是睡着了。或者他和明日香在做同样的事情。

As Misato's footsteps drifted away, Asuka thought she heard her sighing. She found herself feeling a little sorry for Misato, but only a little.  
随着美里脚步声的远去，明日香觉得自己听到了她的叹息。她发现自己对美里感到一丝歉意，但仅仅是一丝。

There was a faint trickle of water from the bathroom, soon followed by the sound of the door to Misato's room opening and closing. Asuka still gave herself a reasonable amount of time to make sure Misato wouldn't hear her before letting out a deep sigh and sitting up.  
浴室里传来微弱的滴水声，紧接着是美里房间门开合的声音。明日香仍然给自己留了足够的时间，确保美里不会听到她的动静，然后才深深叹了口气，坐起身来。

Part of her wanted to just go to sleep now, but she'd slept so much during the day that it was simply impossible. Her eyes darted around for something to pass the time. Her cell phone caught her eye. She'd thrown it on the bed when she'd gotten back to her room.  
她的一部分想要现在就入睡，但她白天已经睡得太多，这根本不可能。她的目光四处搜寻，寻找打发时间的东西。她的手机吸引了她的注意。她回到房间时，随手将它扔在了床上。

Asuka picked it up without much thought, her mind strangely aloof. Come to think of it, she didn't touch her phone today not because she'd truly forgotten about it, but because she was afraid of what Shinji might have texted her. Why she was touching her phone now was beyond her.  
明日香没怎么多想就把它拿了起来，心思却出奇地飘忽。仔细想想，她今天没碰手机并非真的忘了，而是害怕真嗣可能给她发了什么信息。为什么现在又拿起手机，她自己也说不清。

And even that wasn't going as she wished. The phone, left unattended since yesterday evening, was dead. Asuka reached toward the wall for the charger cord.  
就连这一点也未能如她所愿。手机从昨晚就无人问津，已经没电了。明日香伸手去墙边找充电线。

As soon as the jack was inserted and the red light flashed about a minute later, Asuka pressed the power button. The screen lit up, then immediately went low-power mode, its brightness dimmed. While the phone booted up, Asuka sat cross-legged on her bed, and hugged her pillow like it was a shield.  
插头一插上，一分钟后红灯闪烁，明日香便按下了电源键。屏幕亮起，随即进入低电量模式，亮度变暗。手机启动时，明日香盘腿坐在床上，像抱着盾牌一样抱着枕头。

One missed call from Misato. Several unchecked text messages. All of them were from girls she usually texted, including Hikari. The opening lines in the preview didn't spark any interest, so Asuka hit the check button on all of them.  
来自美里的一次未接来电。好几条未读短信。全都是她常联系的女生发来的，包括光。预览中的开场白并未引起她的兴趣，于是明日香一键查看了所有消息。

Scrolling down, Asuka felt something was weird and scrolled back up. Sure enough, she saw it right. There hadn't been a single text from Shinji all day.  
往下翻阅时，明日香感觉有些不对劲，又往上翻了回去。果然，她看对了。一整天下来，竟然一条来自真嗣的短信都没有。

_No way.  不可能。_

Asuka pressed the button and scrolled up and down her inbox. She started to think that maybe she underestimated Shinji's resentment. Then she finally found her last text with Shinji in the middle of the inbox.  
明日香按下按钮，上下翻动着收件箱。她开始觉得，或许自己低估了真嗣的怨气。最终，她在收件箱中间找到了与真嗣的最后一条短信。

But did she? Asuka squinted and brought the screen closer to her face. Only then did she realize why it had taken her so long to find Shinji's name.  
但她真的找到了吗？明日香眯起眼睛，将屏幕凑近了脸。直到这时，她才明白为什么花了这么长时间才找到真嗣的名字。

She found his message because there was something familiar in the first few lines of the preview her inbox was showing her. The sender's name that was presented on the left side, where she paid most of her attention, was completely wrong.  
她之所以发现他的消息，是因为收件箱预览的前几行中有种熟悉感。而左侧显示的发件人名字，她平时主要关注的地方，却完全不对。

Asuka frowned. 明日香皱起了眉头。

_This can't be right. 这不可能对。_

But the word she was seeing was a solid reality. And a rather absurd one at that.  
但她眼前所见的字眼却是确凿无疑的现实。而且颇为荒谬。

In the place where _Third Child_, the name she saved, was supposed to be, there was instead something completely different written there: _my daring_. No capital letter, completely misspelled, and something she definitely did not remember writing herself.  
本该是三号孩子，她保存的名字所在之处，却赫然写着完全不同的东西：my daring。没有大写字母，完全拼写错误，而且她绝对不记得自己写过这个。

_Did he...? 他真的...？_

He did have plenty of time for that. It must have happened while Asuka was showering. He must have picked up her phone, gone through its contents, and changed his name in the contacts list. It had to have happened like that. It was hard to think of any other explanation.  
他确实有足够的时间做那件事。一定是在明日香洗澡的时候发生的。他肯定是拿起了她的手机，浏览了里面的内容，然后更改了联系人列表中的名字。事情一定是这样发生的。很难想到其他解释。

Something crossed her mind, so she opened the contacts list and pushed the down button several times. And sure enough, she found something she half-expected.  
她脑海中闪过一个念头，于是她打开联系人列表，多次按下向下按钮。果然，她发现了一些她半预料到的东西。

Mr. Kaji's name, which had previously been saved as Kaji my love, was now Ryoji Kaji. And she didn't do this either.  
之前被保存为‘加治我的爱’的加治先生的名字，现在变成了碇源堂。而她也没有这样做。

_This is creepy. 这太诡异了。_

She knew this to be true on a rational level. But for some reason, Asuka found it hard to feel that way. Instead, a small smile appeared on her lips. It felt like a manic cycle considering the state she was in just a moment ago, but even so, Asuka felt a strange sense of exaltation now.  
她理智上知道这是真的。但不知为何，明日香却难以产生这种感觉。相反，她的唇边浮现出一丝微笑。考虑到她刚才的状态，这感觉像是一种狂躁的循环，但即便如此，明日香现在却感到一种莫名的兴奋。

It wasn't that different from the time Shinji had tried to sneak a kiss on her. Imagining anyone else in his position, say, that glass-wearing pervert who had been caught taking pictures of her for example, made Asuka feel nauseous and gave her goosebumps. But Shinji doing the same thing made her feel the exact opposite.  
这与当初真嗣试图偷偷吻她的情景并无太大差别。想象一下，如果是其他人在他这个位置，比如说那个被抓到偷拍她的眼镜变态，会让明日香感到恶心并起鸡皮疙瘩。但真嗣做同样的事情，却让她产生了完全相反的感觉。

Asuka stood up from her seat. The pillow rolled onto the floor, but she didn't even glance in its direction. She wanted to go to Shinji's room right now, though she had no idea what she'd say to him, and she honestly still hadn't decided what to make of this blatant breach of her privacy either. But she wanted to see him. Now.  
明日香从座位上站起身来。枕头滚落到地板上，但她连看都没看一眼。她现在就想去真嗣的房间，尽管她不知道该对他说些什么，而且她确实还没决定如何看待这次明显的侵犯她隐私的行为。但她想见他。现在。

But when she reached the door, she froze again. The enthusiasm that had gotten her out of bed only a breath ago was gone now. Instead, chilly suspicion filled the empty void it left.  
但当她走到门口时，她再次僵住了。刚才让她下床的那股热情已经消失无踪，取而代之的是冰冷的怀疑，填满了留下的空虚。

_If I go back to him now, wouldn't it seem like I'm doing it only because his sync rate became lower than mine again? Wouldn't he feel that way? Can I even convince myself it really has nothing to do with this?  
如果我现在回到他身边，会不会显得我只是因为他同步率再次低于我？他会不会那样想？我甚至能说服自己这真的与此无关吗？_

That would be so nasty and vile. And now that she thought about it, she realized that what she had just felt was indeed silly and ridiculous. He literally went into her phone and changed her contact names because he got jealous of them.  
那会非常卑鄙和恶劣。现在她想起来，刚才的感觉确实愚蠢可笑。他竟然因为嫉妒而擅自进入她的手机，更改了联系人名称。

Asuka looked back down at her phone, which was still in her hand. The screen flashed a few times before turning off, its battery dead again.  
明日香再次低头看向手中的手机，屏幕闪烁了几下后熄灭，电池又耗尽了。

Asuka threw her phone onto the bed, then threw herself on it too. Her nails scratched her side as she roughly unwrapped the towel. She then rolled it into a ball and roughly tossed it against the desk. Then she shut her eyes tightly.  
明日香将手机扔到床上，随后自己也扑了上去。她粗暴地解开毛巾，指甲在侧边划过。接着她将毛巾卷成一团，猛地朝书桌扔去。然后她紧紧闭上了眼睛。

It took her a long time to fall asleep.  
她花了很长时间才入睡。

### Chapter 21 Gone

Gendo Ikari wiped the sweat from his forehead. It was unpleasantly greasy. Through the windshield, he could see that the crowd exiting the shrine was heading this way, toward the parking lot they were in. The parking lot was still relatively deserted, but that wouldn't last long.  
碇源堂擦去额头上的汗水，感觉油腻得令人不快。透过挡风玻璃，他看到从神社出来的人群正朝这边走来，目标正是他们所在的停车场。停车场目前还算空旷，但这种状况不会持续太久。

"Better hurry up, we might get stuck in here."  
“最好快点，我们可能会被困在这里。”

Before he could even finish his sentence, the backseat door slammed shut. Gendo lifted his eyes to check the rearview mirror. Shinji was fast asleep, fastened in his child seat.  
他话还没说完，后座车门就砰地关上了。源渡抬起眼睛查看后视镜。真嗣已经系着儿童座椅，沉沉睡去。

Yui slid into the passenger seat, closing the door. She began fanning herself with both hands. Her furrowed brow was glistening with sweat.  
唯滑进副驾驶座，关上门。她开始用双手扇风，眉头紧皱，额头上闪着汗珠。

"Why don't you try doing it yourself for once? I bet you don't even know how heavy your son has gotten lately."  
"为什么你不亲自试试看？我敢打赌，你甚至不知道你儿子最近长重了多少。"

"That's an exaggeration. Might even think I'd never held him before or something."  
"那有点夸张了。简直像是我以前从没抱过他似的。"

"Like you did today at the shrine?"  
"就像今天在神社那样？"

Gendo started the car, groaning slightly. A quiet bass vibration filled the steel box they were in, a far cry from the noise his old car made. It was one of the many things that had been bestowed on him after proving his loyalty and being allowed to marry Yui. No one would care if Gendo Rokubungi drove a weathered, rattling used car. But plenty of people cared if the son-in-law of House Ikari did.  
源堂启动了汽车，微微呻吟了一声。低沉的贝斯震动充斥着他们所在的钢铁盒子，与他的旧车发出的噪音相去甚远。这是在他证明忠诚并获准与唯结婚后，众多恩赐之一。没人会在乎源堂·六分仪是否开着一辆破旧、嘎吱作响的二手车。但许多人却很在意，作为碇家女婿的他是否体面。

He turned on the air conditioner. "He doesn't like it when I touch him, you know that."  
他打开了空调。“你知道的，他不喜欢我碰他。”

"Only because he's not used to it."  
“只是因为他还不习惯。”

"Nah, sons are supposed to prefer their moms to their dads. The opposite case is virtually unheard of."  
"不，儿子通常更喜欢妈妈而不是爸爸。反过来几乎闻所未闻。"

"Huh." "嗯。"

"What's that supposed to mean? It's the truth."  
"你这是什么意思？我说的是实话。"

"Are you sure about that?"  
"你确定吗？"

"Have you ever been a son?"  
"你曾经当过儿子吗？"

Yui shook her head silently, turning the air vent in her direction. It was a lukewarm breeze since the car started only a moment ago, but it was still better than the summer heat. She sighed and wiped her forehead. Gendo smirked at the sight.  
绫摇了摇头，默默地将空调出风口转向自己。由于车子刚启动不久，吹来的风还是温热的，但总比夏日的酷热要好。她叹了口气，擦了擦额头。看到这一幕，源堂嘴角勾起了一丝笑意。

"Hatsumode in the middle of the heat wave. Ridiculous, isn't it?"  
"在热浪中进行初诣。真是荒谬，不是吗？"

"It's the new reality of the so-called Post-Impact Japan."  
"这就是所谓的‘后冲击’日本的全新现实。"

"Ah, the Impact. Sometimes I wonder if this country's population shrunk at all. Think of what we've been through today. Crowds like this in the middle of nowhere, Hakone? Imagine what it would've been like in Tokyo-2."  
"啊，那次冲击。有时候我会想，这个国家的人口是否真的减少了。想想我们今天经历的这一切。在这荒郊野外，箱根都能挤成这样？想象一下在东京-2 会是什么情景。"

"For most of them this must have been their first visit since the Impact. It was impossible to care about things like this until recently."  
"对他们中的大多数人来说，这肯定是自冲击以来的首次造访。直到最近，人们才有可能开始关心这类事情。"

"Maybe." "或许吧。"

"Maybe? I'm always right."  
“或许吧？我总是对的。”

Gendo chuckled, starting the car. Then he slammed on the brakes. The car that tried to cut them off honked in response. Gendo glared in the car's direction. Several years ago this might have led to a fight, or a road rage chase, or at the very least a nasty exchange, but this time he didn't say anything, instead stepping on the gas again.  
碇源堂轻笑一声，启动了汽车。随后他猛踩刹车。试图插队的那辆车鸣笛回应。碇源堂朝那辆车瞪了一眼。几年前，这可能会引发一场斗殴，或是一场路怒追逐，甚至至少会有一次激烈的争吵，但这次他什么也没说，只是再次踩下油门。

On the periphery of his vision, he could see Yui tilting her head. "Be careful, won't you?"  
在他视野的边缘，他能看到唯侧着头。“小心点，好吗？”

"I had the right of way, not that jackass." Gendo snorted. "Now that I think of it, there must be a negative correlation between one's chance of surviving the Impact and their driving skills. And the quality of their character. So much trash on the road these days. Only the bad ones survived the Impact, I tell you."  
"我有先行权，那个混蛋没有。" 源渡哼了一声。"现在想想，一个人的生存几率和他们的驾驶技术之间肯定存在负相关。还有他们的性格品质。如今路上尽是些垃圾。我告诉你，只有那些坏家伙才在冲击中幸存下来。"

"Like us?" "像我们这样？"

Gendo glanced back at Yui. She was staring straight ahead with an odd look on her face.  
源渡回头看向唯。她正直视前方，脸上带着一种奇怪的表情。

Second Impact was not a topic that came up often between them, including the little joke he just made. It wasn't like he was consciously avoiding it, or at least he thought so. And he regretted referencing it already.  
第二次冲击并不是他们常谈的话题，包括他刚刚开的那个小玩笑。他并非有意回避，至少他是这么认为的。而他已经开始后悔提及此事了。

He didn't like the face she was making. It happened less than it used to, and with much less intensity, but Gendo still felt uneasy at times like this. He couldn't understand the look on her face. He thought he knew her so well, and yet he was still drawing a blank, still unable to parse the hidden meaning in the set of her mouth, the glitter of her eyes. It was unpleasant, uncomfortable. So he quickly found something to fill the silence that was about to descend.  
他不喜欢她此刻的表情。这种情况比以前少见，强度也减弱了许多，但像现在这样，碇源堂仍感到不安。他无法理解她脸上的神情。他以为自己很了解她，然而他依旧茫然，依旧无法解读她嘴角的弧度、眼中的闪光背后隐藏的含义。这让他感到不快，不舒服。于是他迅速找了个话题来填补即将降临的沉默。

"What did you pray for today? You took your time. The couple behind us was giving you dirty looks, you know."  
“你今天祈祷了什么？你花了那么长时间。我们后面的那对情侣都在瞪你了，知道吗？”

The corner of Yui's mouth lifted slightly. The procession through the toll booth started to move slowly, so Gendo had to tear his eyes off her face for a moment. When the car came to a stop again, Yui spoke up.  
悠的嘴角微微上扬。收费亭的队伍开始缓缓移动，这让源堂不得不暂时将目光从她的脸上移开。当车子再次停下时，悠开口了。

"It's bad luck to disclose what you prayed for."  
“透露祈祷的内容会带来厄运。”

Gendo snorted. "If you don't want to tell me, just say so."  
源堂哼了一声。“如果你不想告诉我，直说就是了。”

"You wouldn't believe me even if I did."  
"即使我说了，你也不会相信。"

"You don't know that." "你又怎么知道我不会信？"

Cicadas chirped. Worshippers chattered happily as they swarmed past their car. The air conditioner wheezed faintly. There was a high-pitched, tinny ringing in his ears. Truth. Or lie.  
蝉鸣阵阵。信徒们欢声笑语，蜂拥而过他们的车旁。空调微弱地喘息着。他的耳中回荡着尖锐而微弱的铃声。真相。或是谎言。

Yui cocked her head and glanced at Gendo. The soft smile Gendo had recognized from earlier was still on her face. "The permanent existence of humanity. So steadfast and concrete no prophecy or calamity could threaten it."  
Yui 歪着头瞥了瞥碇。她脸上那抹碇之前就熟悉的温柔微笑依旧未变。“人类永恒的存在。如此坚定而具体，没有任何预言或灾难能够威胁到它。”

Silence fell for a moment, to be broken by Yui's sudden laughter. It did not stop even after Gendo sighed and shook his head.  
沉默降临了一会儿，随即被 Yui 突如其来的笑声打破。即便碇叹了口气并摇了摇头，她的笑声也未曾停歇。

"Oh, Mr. Rokubungi, I wish you could see your face right now."  
“哦，六本木先生，真希望您能看到自己现在的表情。”

"Keep your secrets. Must be a big deal to you."  
"保守你的秘密。对你来说一定很重要。"

"Are _you_ going to tell me what you prayed for?"  
"你打算告诉我你祈祷了什么吗？"

A simple wish: for everything to stay the same. An eternal summer. "Well, on the principle of reciprocity, no."  
一个简单的愿望：希望一切保持不变。永恒的夏日。“好吧，基于互惠原则，不。”

Yui, without a word, rested her head on the chair's neckrest. Silence fell.  
优依一言不发，将头靠在椅子的头枕上。四周陷入了沉默。

Time passed. 时间流逝。

The line moved at a snail-like pace. Gendo let out an irritated snort.  
队伍以蜗牛般的速度前进。源度发出了一声不耐烦的哼声。

"It's bad enough already. Going to get much worse when construction of the fortress city starts in earnest. Maybe we should start skipping Hatsumode. Spend time on something better."  
“情况已经够糟了。等到要塞城市的建设真正开始时，会更糟糕。也许我们应该开始跳过初诣，把时间花在更有意义的事情上。”

"Maybe." "或许吧。"

Her voice was strangely dreamy. Something he didn't notice at the time. Back then, he had just nodded absently, not paying much mind to it. "Yeah, let's not bother with this anymore."  
她的声音异常梦幻，当时他并未注意到这一点。那时，他只是心不在焉地点了点头，没太在意。“是啊，我们别再为这事费心了。”

That was January 2004. 那是 2004 年 1 月。

At least one of his hopes was fulfilled, albeit in a strange way.  
至少有一个愿望以一种奇怪的方式实现了。

Because he never visited a shrine on New Year's again.  
因为他再也没有在新年时去参拜神社。
