Shinji and Asuka, being the last humans alive, must fend for themselves, and make a new life. (07/25/14) I have recently re-taken an interest in this story. A little editing (fixing grammar and spelling mistakes) and revising (changes to the story to fix plot problems or dead ends) is in order. Perhaps I will even write some new material once I remember where it was going.  
碇真嗣和惣流·明日香·兰格雷，作为最后存活的人类，必须自力更生，创造新生活。（2014 年 7 月 25 日）我最近重新对这篇故事产生了兴趣。需要进行一些编辑（修正语法和拼写错误）和修订（对故事进行改动以解决情节问题或死胡同）。或许等我记起故事的发展方向后，还会写一些新内容。

The previous revision of Life After Eva was started while I was deployed in Afghanistan in 2004. 10 years later, and my life has changed quite a bit. I received a favorite notification for this story in my email, and came to take a look at it (it has gotten kind of dusty in the writing room in my head). I enjoyed writing all of these stories (some are better than others, but such is the learning process) but I think this one was my favorite. I wrote it at a time when I felt cut off from the world I knew and I tried extending that to the story.  
《Eva 之后的生活》上一版是在 2004 年我驻扎阿富汗期间开始的。十年过去了，我的生活发生了很大变化。我在邮箱中收到了这篇故事的收藏通知，于是回来看看（它在脑海中的写作室里积了些灰尘）。我很享受写这些故事（有些比其他的更好，但这就是学习的过程），但我觉得这是我最喜欢的一篇。我在感觉与所知世界隔绝的时候写下了它，并试图将这种感觉延伸到故事中。

### Chapter 1 Day1

"I feel sick." “我感觉不舒服。”

Shinji let his hands slide off of the girl's neck, and leaned on them, letting sand creep through his fingers. Asuka just stared at him, waiting for him to finish. The boy cried as he slowly came to grips with the situation he was in. Alone, save for the only person who really knew him at all, and witness to the end of life, as it was known on Earth. The yellow waves washed up against the white sand and retreated back into the sea, the gentle suffing sound was the only noise.  
真嗣松开了女孩的脖子，双手撑着身体，任由沙子从指间滑落。明日香只是盯着他，等待他说完。男孩哭泣着，慢慢接受了自己所处的境地。孤独一人，除了唯一真正了解他的那个人，见证了地球上生命的终结。黄色的波浪拍打着白色的沙滩，又退回海中，那轻柔的沙沙声是唯一的噪音。

He rolled off of her, and lay with his back to her. She lay there watching the sky, wondering at the bewildering turn that things had taken. A day before she had battled and beaten nine Eva Mass Production Model combat units by herself. Triumphant exuberation, leading very quickly to fear, despair, agony, darkness. Today she was lying on the beach, her arm nearly split open, her left eye injured, and "saved" by Shinji once again.  
他从她身上滚落，背对着她躺下。她躺在那里仰望天空，对事情的突变感到困惑。就在一天前，她独自一人与九台 EVA 量产型战斗单元激战并取胜。胜利的喜悦迅速转为恐惧、绝望、痛苦、黑暗。而今天，她躺在沙滩上，手臂几乎被撕裂，左眼受伤，又一次被真嗣“救”了。

She hated him. 她恨他。

She had been ready for her death after she had fallen to those ugly-faced MP-Evas. She would have welcomed it. She had remembered being a part of hundreds, thousands, millions of others, knowing their thoughts, feeling what they felt. She unconsciously flexed her hands into fists, and fire ran up the inside of her left arm. Gasping at the pain, she let it hurt. Pain was at least a proof that you were still alive. And what did not kill you ... Did it really make you stronger? That had yet to be seen.  
在跌落到那些丑陋的量产型 EVA 手中后，她已准备好迎接死亡。她本会欣然接受。她记得自己曾是数百、数千、数百万人的一部分，知晓他们的思想，感受他们的感受。她无意识地握紧双拳，左臂内侧燃起火焰。因疼痛而喘息，她任由其痛。痛苦至少证明你还活着。那些未将你击垮的……真的会让你更强大吗？这还有待观察。

She closed her eyes, and listened to the waves. Surprisingly, her arm stopped hurting again in the next few minutes, and she drifted to sleep. In her dreams she relived the Third Impact again. It was in a way beautiful, as well as horrible, yet it was also peaceful at the same time. But she was still terrified. The savage reaping of human lives and screams (Where they screams? Or laughter? Or cheering?) as bodies lost cohesion and souls were drawn to the colossal figure that rose from the Earth. The veritable ocean of blood that sprayed from the neck of the person she had known as Rei.  
她闭上眼睛，聆听着海浪的声音。出乎意料地，她的手臂在接下来的几分钟内再次停止了疼痛，她渐渐进入了梦乡。在梦中，她再次经历了第三次冲击。那场景既美丽又恐怖，同时又带着一丝宁静。但她依然感到恐惧。人类生命的残酷收割与尖叫（那是尖叫吗？还是笑声？抑或是欢呼？），当身体失去凝聚力，灵魂被吸引向那从地球上崛起的巨型身影。她所认识的名为绫波的人，其颈部喷涌出的血海。

Later on, she awoke again. Shinji was gone from her side. In his place was a stack of wood. Night was falling, and it was starting to get chilly. Grunting she rolled onto her side, and used her good arm to unsteadily prop herself up. It was then that she saw Shinji making his way towards her, carrying a box, and wearing a heavy looking hiking backpack. As he drew closer she saw that he was looking pale, sweating, and breathing heavily. Setting his things down, he looked over at her, and furrowed his eyebrows.  
后来，她再次醒来。真嗣已不在她身边。取而代之的是一堆木柴。夜幕降临，气温开始变得寒冷。她咕哝着侧身翻滚，用她那只还能动的手臂不稳地支撑起自己。就在这时，她看到真嗣正朝她走来，手里提着一个箱子，背上背着看起来很沉重的登山背包。当他走近时，她注意到他脸色苍白，满头大汗，呼吸急促。放下物品后，他转头看向她，皱起了眉头。

"I didn't mean to leave you alone, Asuka. I just… went to get some things to help us make it through tonight." He turned away so that he would not have to look at her scowl at him. She still had not said anything to him but those three words. He busied himself with starting the fire ignoring his feelings of hurt and anguish, and set up two small tents. He also pulled out a couple of sleeping bags, some packages of what looked like food of some kind, some clean clothes for both he and Asuka, and some medical supplies.  
"“我不是故意让你一个人待着的，明日香。我只是……去拿些东西帮我们度过今晚。”他转过身去，以免不得不面对她的怒容。她仍然没有对他说过那三个字之外的话。他忙着生火，忽略了自己的伤心和痛苦，搭起了两个小帐篷。他还拿出了几个睡袋，一些看起来像是食物的包裹，一些干净的衣服，供他和明日香换洗，以及一些医疗用品。”

As darkness set in, the moon's pale light illuminated the area around them in a soft blue cast. The new red streak splashed tightly across the sky shown brightly in contrast to the normal sky's deep blue background, illuminating the light terrain around them. Surrounding the moon was also a small halo of red where blood had splashed with enough force to be ejected back off the surface. The light from the fire cast streaky shadows along the sand.  
夜幕降临，月亮苍白的光芒在柔和的蓝色调中照亮了他们周围的地方。新添的红色条纹紧贴着天空，在深蓝色背景的映衬下显得格外明亮，照亮了周围的地形。月亮周围也有一圈红色光晕，仿佛是血液溅出后又被弹回表面形成的。火光在沙地上投下斑驳的影子。

Shinji dug into the box with the food in it, and produced some store bought fish. Undoubtedly the power had gone off not too long ago and the freezers were still able to hold some of the heat out. He placed the fillets on a spit and directed them over the fire. He took some large potatoes and wrapped them in foil, and put them in the fire. He also produced a canteen cup and poured some water in it, and set it just inside the fire to boil.  
真嗣从装食物的箱子里翻出一些店里买的鱼，无疑是不久前停电了，冰箱还能暂时保持低温。他把鱼片放在烤架上，对着火烤。他又拿出几个大土豆，用锡纸包好，放进火里。还拿出了一个水壶杯，倒了些水进去，放在火边煮沸。

Asuka was amazed at this. She couldn't believe that Shinji knew anything about camping. Of course she supposed that when it really came down to it, it was simple common sense and improvising. Adapt, improvise and overcome. She sat and watched the fire, moving a little closer to collect some of the heat. While the food was cooking, he broke out some of the medical supplies and slowly moved closer to her. As he neared she drew away sharply.  
明日香对此感到惊讶。她不敢相信真嗣居然懂得露营知识。当然，她想，当真正需要时，这只是简单的常识和即兴发挥。适应、即兴和克服。她坐下来看着火，稍微挪近一些取暖。在烹饪食物的同时，他拿出一些医疗用品，慢慢向她靠近。当他接近时，她突然退缩了。

"I have to look at those, Asuka." Shinji said, pointing to Asuka's arm and the wounds on it. "We need to make sure they heal properly." He watched her frown, and she eyed him for a moment. He just looked at her, waiting for her to allow him to treat her.  
“我得看看那些伤，明日香。”真嗣指着明日香的手臂和上面的伤口说，“我们需要确保它们能正确愈合。”他看着她皱眉，她盯着他看了一会儿。他只是看着她，等待她允许他为她治疗。

"It better not hurt much, or I'm gonna clobber you." She glared at him unconvincingly. Secretly, even to herself, she was grateful for the help, for all that he had done so far, but she could never allow Shinji to know that.  
"最好别太疼，不然我可要揍你了。" 她不怎么有说服力地瞪着他。私下里，甚至对自己，她都感激他的帮助，感激他迄今为止所做的一切，但她绝不能让真嗣知道这一点。

Shinji carefully unwrapped her arm, and inspected the wound running down its length. A deep gash extended along the outside length of her arm. The bandages had been doing a good job of holding it together, but if it was going to heal properly, it would need some stitches. Until he could get some anesthetic, a needle and some sutures, the bandages would have to do. Taking a cloth, and pouring some clean water on it, he wiped away the caked blood and clot. Then with a bottle of hydrogen peroxide, he doused the entire length of the wound, and let it foam, wiping away the excess when it was done. Asuka tensed at this; the burning sensation was very sudden and intense. Next he put some antibiotic ointment on, and re-wrapped the wound with bandage after applying a thick gauze strip directly over the wound.

Next he treated the eye wound. Shinji hoped that it was not really bad. Especially something that would leave her without the use of that eye. He had always liked her eyes, not that he would ever tell her that. She definitely would clobber him for sure for saying it.  
接着，他处理了眼部伤口。真嗣希望情况并不严重，尤其是不要影响到她的视力。他一直很喜欢她的眼睛，不过他绝不会告诉她这一点。她肯定会因为这句话而狠狠揍他一顿。

Carefully removing the pad and tape, he saw that the wound was not directly to the eyeball, but more to the bottom of the eye socket. Directly under the eye the skin had been pierced. So long as the bone had not been broken, the lining of the eye socket torn or the optic nerve damaged it would be OK. It did not look too serious but he figured it would be best to leave the area covered for the time being, so he cleaned and dressed it again, then re-taped it. Asuka flinched several times and even lifted her arm to take a swing at Shinji, but she held off knowing he was just doing this to help her. So she bore the pain some more as he finished treating her.  
他小心翼翼地移除纱布和胶带，发现伤口并未直接伤及眼球，而是位于眼窝底部。眼下方的皮肤被刺穿了。只要骨头没有断裂，眼窝内衬未撕裂，视神经未受损，应该就没事。虽然看起来不算太严重，但他认为暂时还是覆盖住伤口为好，于是再次清洁并包扎，重新贴上胶带。明日香几次疼得缩了一下，甚至举起手臂想要揍真嗣，但她忍住了，知道他这么做是为了帮她。于是她又忍着痛，直到他处理完毕。

By this time the water was boiling, and the fish and potato was just about done. Carefully pulling the water off, Shinji produced a box of instant rice. He had wished that he could have found some of the good stuff, not the name brand rice, but it would do. Dumping it into the water, he turned his attention to the other food. He set the fish on a rock, and unwrapped the potatoes to let them cool off.  
此时水已经沸腾，鱼和土豆也差不多熟了。小心地将水倒掉，真嗣拿出了一盒即食米饭。他本希望能找到一些更好的，不是名牌的那种，但这也凑合。他将米饭倒入水中，转而关注其他食物。他把鱼放在一块石头上，解开土豆的包装，让它们冷却。

As the meat and potatoes cooled, and the former Third Child strained the rice out of the water. He put the food on two paper plates and handed Asuka hers. They ate in silence. Shinji was thankful for that. He needed time to think some things over. They both did. What would happen now? What was their purpose now?  
随着肉和土豆冷却，前第三适格者将米饭从水中滤出。他把食物放在两个纸盘上，递给明日香一个。他们默默地吃着。真嗣对此感到庆幸。他需要时间思考一些事情。他们都需要。现在会发生什么？他们现在的目的是什么？

Asuka finished first, and sat back against a large piece of driftwood that Shinji had hauled close to the fire. "Shinji?"  
明日香最先吃完，靠在真嗣拖到火堆旁的一大块浮木上。“真嗣？”

"Mmph?" His voice muffled through his food.  
"嗯？" 他的声音被食物闷住了。

"Why did you bring me back here?" She gave him a flat stare.  
"你为什么把我带回这里？" 她给了他一个冷漠的眼神。

"What do you mean Asuka? I didn't really..." She cut him off.  
"你什么意思，明日香？我并没有真的..." 她打断了他。

"You brought me back here!" She said accusingly. "You brought me back to this... this life, this world!" she said disgustedly. She paused, then sighed shaking her head. "I was ready to die Shinji, and you took it from me!" Tears welled in her eyes, and threatened to run down her cheeks, but she wiped them away with the back of her good hand, and looked angrily at Shinji.  
“你把我带回来了！”她指责道，“你把我带回了这个……这个生活，这个世界！”她厌恶地说。她顿了顿，然后叹了口气，摇摇头，“我准备好去死了，真嗣，你却剥夺了我的选择！”泪水在她眼眶中打转，眼看就要滑落脸颊，但她用那只好手背擦去，愤怒地瞪着真嗣。

"But, Asuka. I didn't do anything to bring you back. I was as surprised to see you as you were when I woke up. You were not supposed to be there. I just wanted a world where no one would hurt me. And I was willing to be alone if that was what it took."  
“但是，明日香。我并没有做什么让你回来。我看到你时和你醒来时看到我一样惊讶。你不应该在那里的。我只想要一个没有人会伤害我的世界。如果需要孤独，我也愿意接受。”

"Well how the hell do you explain the fact that I am here? Hmm?" Asuka was yelling now. "You can bet that I will hurt you sooner or later." She glared at him. "And don't you even say that it is because of my strength of will or something equally stupid! I am no more or less deserving than anyone else in the world. How do you explain it?" She let the question hang, waiting for an answer.  
“那你怎么解释我在这里的事实？嗯？”明日香现在大喊起来，“你可以打赌，我迟早会伤害你。”她瞪着他，“别跟我说是因为我的意志力或其他什么愚蠢的理由！我和世界上其他人一样，既不多也不少。你怎么解释？”她让问题悬而未决，等待着答案。

Shinji thought about it for a while, then remembered … 'mother'. He looked up intently and spoke. "Eva protected you."  
真嗣思索了一会儿，然后想起了……‘母亲’。他专注地抬起头，说道：“Eva 保护了你。”

That set her back. "Eva? Momma? Protected me even then?"  
这让她愣住了。“Eva？妈妈？那时候也在保护我吗？”

At the mention of her mother, Shinji perked up. There was a connection between her mother and Eva … just like him? He had only known pieces of her past. From what he knew her mother had worked on the Eva project in Germany. She had died somehow when Asuka was very young. Asuka did not talk about her much. He could understand how it was a sensitive subject.  
提到她的母亲，真嗣精神一振。她的母亲和 Eva 之间有联系……就像他一样吗？他只知道她过去的一些片段。据他所知，她的母亲曾在德国参与 Eva 项目。她在明日香很小的时候就去世了。明日香很少谈及她。他能理解这是一个敏感的话题。

Shinji drew his knees up and laid his head on them watching the waves. They were both quiet for half an hour, when Shinji broke the silence. Softly he spoke, haltingly at first, then gradually with more conviction. "My mother was in Eva. I think that is the only reason I survived. I know it's the only reason I survived. She killed several Angels for me. And I think… I think she even brought me back once. I remember almost feeling something… familiar… when I was in the entry plug."  
真嗣抱膝而坐，将头靠在膝盖上，凝视着海浪。两人沉默了半小时，直到真嗣打破了寂静。他轻声开口，起初有些迟疑，随后逐渐坚定起来。“我母亲曾驾驶过 EVA。我想，那是我能活下来的唯一原因。我知道，那是我活下来的唯一原因。她为我击退了好几只使徒。而且我想……我想她甚至救过我一次。我记得在插入栓里，几乎感受到了某种……熟悉的东西。”

Asuka could see only part of his face in the firelight, and she saw that he was crying quiet tears. Shinji was quiet again now, but she could see that he still had something he wanted to say.  
在火光的映照下，明日香只能看到他脸的一部分，她发现他在默默流泪。真嗣再次安静下来，但她看得出他还有话想说。

"I saw her die, Asuka. I remembered it a while back. I was in the control room above Unit 01's cage, and she was standing on the catwalk wearing a solid white plug suit. For a long time I had no real memories of her. I couldn't remember what she looked like, but I remember this. She was beautiful. She waved at me, and she was smiling." He took a shuddering breath. "They had an entry plug kind of like ours that she got into, then it was loaded into Unit 01. And then everything was red and there were sirens going off and people shouting and running everywhere. And she was gone. But she was smiling. And she was with me. With me the whole time. She was in Eva."  
"我亲眼看见她死去，明日香。不久前我记起来了。我当时在初号机笼子上的控制室里，她站在天桥上，穿着一身纯白的插入栓服。很长一段时间里，我根本记不起她的样子。我不记得她长什么样，但我记得这一幕。她很美。她向我挥手，她在微笑。" 他颤抖地吸了一口气。"他们有一个类似我们这种的插入栓，她钻了进去，然后被装进初号机。接着一切变得血红，警报响起，人们大喊大叫，四处奔逃。而她消失了。但她一直在微笑。她和我在一起。一直和我在一起。她在 EVA 里。"

Asuka eyed Shinji, absorbing this news. He had never really had the chance to come to grips with his past because he did not know it himself, nor how to deal with it.  
明日香打量着真嗣，消化着这个消息。他从未真正有机会面对自己的过去，因为他自己也不了解，更不知道如何处理。

Shinji sat back, and sighed, thinking things over. "You know when I was… gone for a month?" He sipped at his water. "Ritsuko debriefed me after that, and explained some of the background behind the A.T. Field.  
真嗣向后靠了靠，叹了口气，思考着。"你知道我那次……消失了一个月吗？"他喝了一口水。"之后赤木律子对我进行了简报，解释了一些关于 A.T.力场的背景。

"I had never really known what it stood for. I had never even bothered to ask. But according to her, A.T. stands for Absolute Terror. The term is taken from psychology, and it is a theory that certain traumatic events can cause someone to block out all or part of that event as they choose, because it is so terrible. It is as though it never existed. In the Evas case, it refers to an energy field that living beings give off. She only explained about humans, Angels, and Evas. So I don't know if it is something animals and plants and other living things have. Anyhow, she said that we produce these fields, and that basically it was like a force field for humans that separates our minds from others, and holds our body's cohesion together. For Angels and for Evas when they are piloted, it not only does that but it can be used as a protective shield and a weapon."  
"我从未真正了解过它的含义。我甚至从未费心去问过。但据她所说，A.T. 代表绝对恐怖。这一术语源自心理学，认为某些创伤性事件会让人选择性地遗忘全部或部分该事件，因为它们太过可怕，仿佛这些事件从未存在过。在 EVA 的案例中，它指的是生物散发出的能量场。她只解释了人类、使徒和 EVA 的情况。所以我不知道这是否是动物、植物和其他生物所具有的。无论如何，她说我们产生这些场，基本上它就像人类的力场，将我们的心灵与其他人隔离开来，并维持我们身体的凝聚力。对于使徒和由驾驶员操控的 EVA 来说，它不仅能做到这些，还可以作为保护盾和武器。"

Asuka listened, never having delved into the ideas behind it this way, though her University schooling was beginning to help her understand.  
明日香听着，尽管她的大学教育开始帮助她理解这些概念，但她从未以这种方式深入探讨过背后的理念。

"Evas are like an empty body that has no mind or soul, so the pilot has to share their mind with it, which means that when synching with the Eva, part of your own AT Field is borrowed by the Eva. That allows you to feel it's feelings, and you control it using your thought. Ritsuko's mother had notes about that stuff. They hinted that somehow my mothers AT Field had totally eroded, and so her body had dissolved allowing her mind to occupy the Eva's core. I don't know exactly what that means. She never took complete control over it. I mean she could have spoken through it or something, right? She could have moved it around or something. I didn't catch everything that Ritsuko explained to me. And I am sure she didn't tell me everything either." Shinji let it end with that. He had spoken to Asuka more tonight than he had in any one sitting before.  
"EVA 就像一个没有心智和灵魂的空壳，所以驾驶员必须与之共享心智，这意味着在同步 EVA 时，你的一部分 AT 力场会被 EVA 借用。这让你能感受到它的感受，并通过你的思维来控制它。律子的母亲对此有笔记。她们暗示，不知为何我母亲的 AT 力场完全消融了，她的身体随之溶解，使她的意识占据了 EVA 的核心。我不太明白那具体意味着什么。她从未完全掌控过 EVA。我是说她可能通过 EVA 发声或什么的，对吧？她可能移动过它之类的。律子跟我解释的很多细节我没完全听懂。而且我确信她也没告诉我全部。" 真嗣就这样结束了话题。他今晚和明日香说的话比以往任何一次都要多。

Asuka looked at him with an uncertain look on her face. "Well maybe that would account for my being here. But the next question is what do we do now? So here we are? But why, and for what purpose?"  
明日香看着他，脸上带着不确定的表情。"也许那能解释我为什么会在这里。但下一个问题是，我们现在该怎么办？就这样待在这里？但为什么，又是为了什么目的？

"I don't know. Right now I don't know what to think. I just want to rest and regroup what is left of me." He eyed the tent that he had decided was his.  
"我不知道。现在我不知该如何思考。我只想休息一下，整理一下剩下的自己。" 他看着自己决定作为栖身之所的帐篷。

She saw where he was looking. "Goodnight Shinji." She almost sounded nice. "Don't even think about coming over to my tent, you perv." In the blink of an eye her tone changed, and now she was the "Old Asuka" once more. Shinji inwardly smiled. He was glad to see her back, even for a few minutes.  
她看到他的目光所在。"晚安，真嗣。" 她的声音几乎变得温柔。"别想着来我的帐篷，你这个变态。" 转眼间，她的语气又变了，再次成为了"老明日香"。真嗣内心微笑。他很高兴看到她回来，哪怕只是几分钟。

With some difficulty she stood, and refusing Shinji's help, she walked to her tent, and climbed in, letting out a grunt of pain. After zipping up the door, Shinji heard some rustling, and realizing that she was taking the remnants of her plug suit off. He blushed imagining her there.  
她有些困难地站起身，拒绝了真嗣的帮助，走向自己的帐篷，爬了进去，发出一声痛苦的呻吟。拉上拉链后，真嗣听到里面传来一阵窸窣声，意识到她在脱下剩余的插入栓服。他想象着她在那里的样子，脸红了。

"Asuka? There is some soap in there, if you want to go bathe, there's a public bath still intact down that way, but it has cold water. I … I promise I won't peek or anything. It's just so you don't have to be caked in old LCL."  
“明日香？里面有些肥皂，如果你想洗澡的话，那边有个公共浴室还完好无损，不过只有冷水。我……我保证不会偷看的。只是不想让你浑身沾满旧的 LCL。”

There was no response so he picked up the leftovers. Dumped the rest of the boiled water out, and cleaned the place up as the fire died down. He scooped the embers all together, and put a couple of logs on it, then went to his tent as well. He lay awake for quite some time mulling over everything. The feeling of loss was overwhelming. In one day he had lost Misato, his father, the people he knew at NERV, and all of his friends, everyone he would never know, everyone except Asuka. But, while they were not actually with him, he knew that they were out there somewhere. Heaven he supposed. He guessed that was what the whole Eva thing was all about.  
没有回应，于是他收拾起剩菜。倒掉剩下的开水，清理了现场，随着火势减弱。他将余烬聚拢，添了几根木头，然后也回到了自己的帐篷。他躺了很久，思绪万千。那种失落感压倒了一切。仅仅一天之内，他失去了美里、父亲、NERV 的同事，以及所有的朋友，所有他再也见不到的人，除了明日香。然而，尽管他们实际上并不在他身边，他知道他们一定在某处。他猜想那可能是天堂。他觉得这一切都与 EVA 有关。

Outside he heard the zipper on Asuka's tent door, and for just a moment, he thought she would come over to his tent and tease him or make fun of him. When she never came, he relaxed, comfortable in the knowledge that she had taken the chance to bathe. As the blush crept back in, he smiled, yawned and rolled over to try and sleep. After a while, Asuka padded back past his tent, and entered hers, and after some more thought provoking rustling...  
外面他听到明日香帐篷拉链的声音，有那么一会儿，他以为她会过来找他，取笑他或是开他的玩笑。当她没有来时，他放松了，安心地知道她已经抓住机会去洗澡了。随着脸颊再次泛起红晕，他微笑着，打了个哈欠，翻身试图入睡。过了一会儿，明日香轻轻地走过他的帐篷，回到自己的帐篷，接着又是一阵引人深思的窸窣声……

"Shinji! How the hell did you know my bra size!?" He should have thought this was going to happen.  
“真嗣！你怎么会知道我的胸围尺寸！？”他本该想到这会发生的。

Shinji almost choked. "Asuka, I have been doing your laundry since you moved in to our apartment."  
真嗣差点噎住。“明日香，自从你搬进我们公寓以来，我就一直在帮你洗衣服。”

"Oh … Well you still are a perverted little boy." She sounded almost like she was smiling when she said it. With that he shook his head and finally fell asleep...  
"哦……好吧，你还是个变态的小男孩。" 她说这话时几乎像是在微笑。说完，他摇了摇头，终于睡着了……

### Chapter 2 Day4

Shinji slowly swam toward consciousness. The smells of morning and the sounds of the ocean came to him, pulling him inevitably to open his eyes. Well sort of open them. Or squinted. Let's face it he closed them again, and covered up, denying the world for a few more minutes.  
真嗣缓缓地向清醒游去。清晨的气息和海浪的声音向他袭来，不可避免地让他睁开了眼睛。好吧，算是睁开了一点。或者说眯着。说实话，他又闭上了眼睛，用被子蒙住头，再逃避世界几分钟。

After a terrible fight with reality, he finally lost, and was forced to wake up fully. A few minutes later, he was dressed and standing outside his tent surveying the beach. They had been there for nearly a week. The night before, they had decided it was time to go see to doing something about her arm. Asuka was still asleep, or at least that was what he figured. She usually slept later than he did. The fire was almost dead; it would still have a few glowing embers. Shinji decided that this morning it would be best if they did not eat. He didn't want either of them getting sick, and he had heard somewhere that anesthetics could make you sick if you had a full stomach. Shoveling some sand on it did the trick. He sat against the log, admiring the last of the sunrise.  
在与现实的激烈斗争后，他最终败下阵来，被迫完全醒来。几分钟后，他穿好衣服，站在帐篷外审视着海滩。他们已经在这里待了近一周。昨晚，他们决定是时候去处理她的手臂了。明日香还在睡觉，至少他是这么认为的。她通常比他睡得晚。火几乎要熄灭了；还剩下几颗微弱的余烬。真嗣决定今天早上最好不吃东西。他不希望他们中的任何一个生病，而且他听说麻醉剂可能会让你在吃饱后感到不适。用沙子盖住火堆解决了问题。他坐在木头上，欣赏着日出的最后一抹余晖。

After a few minutes, Asuka was up too, awakened by Shinji's movements. She looked bad. Her uncovered eye had dark baggy flesh under it, and she squinted against the light. She also lost her balance several times. She was still really tired as her injuries had not helped her rest.  
几分钟后，明日香也醒了，被真嗣的动作吵醒。她看起来状态很差。未被遮住的眼睛下有深色的眼袋，她眯着眼对抗光线。她还几次失去了平衡。她仍然非常疲惫，因为她的伤势并没有帮助她休息。

The car that he had liberated a few days ago was still there, waiting for them. It was a yellow little piece of crap that got 50 miles to the gallon, which was the only good thing about it. Shinji had a bit of difficulty driving it due to the fact that he had never been taught to drive a car with manual transmission. So, here he was, an Eva pilot. He could pilot a million pounds of Evangelion all over the city, and yet he could hardly get this car going to save his life. So with the possibility of adding whiplash to their ailments the two made their way to the closest local clinic or hospital.  
几天前他“解放”的那辆车还在那里，等待着他们。这是一辆黄色的小破车，每加仑能跑 50 英里，这是它唯一的好处。真嗣开这辆车有点困难，因为他从未学过开手动挡的汽车。所以，他现在是一名 Eva 驾驶员。他可以在城市里驾驶百万磅重的 Eva，却几乎无法让这辆车动起来以救自己的命。因此，两人带着可能增加颈部扭伤的风险，前往最近的当地诊所或医院。

When they finally got on their way it was easy sailing from there. He followed the hospital signs around until he finally came to what was left of one of the six Tokyo-3 hospitals. The parking lot was empty. It was not really that surprising. There most likely hadn't been anyone admitted to the hospital since Unit 00 detonated, almost totally destroying the city. Fortunately this was far enough from the city center to have survived both that, and the N2 bomb drop. Shinji parked the car, and jumped out. "Wait here for a second."  
"当他们终于上路后，一切变得顺风顺水。他顺着医院指示牌绕来绕去，最终找到了东京-3 六家医院之一仅存的遗迹。停车场空无一人，这并不令人意外。自零号机引爆以来，这座城市几乎被彻底摧毁，很可能再也没有人被送进医院。幸运的是，这里离市中心足够远，得以幸免于那次爆炸和 N2 炸弹的投放。真嗣停好车，跳了出来。“在这里等我一下。””

He disappeared into the hospital for a few moments, and came running back out with a wheelchair.  
他消失在医院里片刻，随即推着一辆轮椅跑了出来。

"Hey! I am not getting in that! I can walk. It's not like I am paralyzed or something." She opened the door, and stood up defiantly.  
“嘿！我才不要坐那个！我能走路。我又没瘫痪什么的。”她打开车门，倔强地站了起来。

"Uh-uh.. You are about to be operated on by me, I think you need to be pampered in your last moments." Shinji had a cross between a smile, and a smirk as Asuka gasped!  
"哎呀...你即将由我来动手术，我想你在这最后的时刻需要被宠一宠。" 真嗣脸上带着一种介于微笑和讥笑之间的表情，让明日香倒吸了一口气！

"That is not funny. I am already really nervous about this. I mean you don't even know what you are doing." She really did look worried now, but she and Shinji both knew that there was nothing that could be done about it. This had to be done or Asuka might not recover.  
"这一点都不好笑。我对此已经非常紧张了。我是说你甚至不知道自己在做什么。" 她现在看起来真的很担心，但她与真嗣都知道，这是无法避免的。这必须完成，否则明日香可能无法康复。

Trying to calm her, Shinji said to her, "Asuka there is not much to it, really. I have just got to get in there, and make sure that it is healing OK, and that it is clean and not infected, then all I'll do is sew it up. That's all. And you can't do that by yourself. Trust me. If I encounter something that I can't deal with, I will stop there, and seek your advice, OK?"  
为了安抚她，真嗣对她说："明日香，其实没那么复杂。我只是需要进去检查一下伤口愈合情况，确保它干净且没有感染，然后我会把它缝合起来。就这些。你自己是做不到的。相信我。如果遇到我处理不了的情况，我会停下来征求你的意见，好吗？"

Asuka sighed. "Yeah, whatever." She sat in the wheelchair, and triumphantly, Shinji wheeled her over to the door. "Hey, just make sure you use the right amount of anesthetic, OK?" Shinji nodded and wheeled her out.  
明日香叹了口气。“是是，随便吧。”她坐在轮椅上，得意地看着真嗣把她推到门口。“嘿，记得用适量的麻醉剂，好吗？”真嗣点点头，推着她出去了。

Since the electricity was off, they couldn't do this inside. So Shinji brought a gurney out, and a couple of medical books. He had come the day before, and gotten some things ready.  
由于停电，他们无法在室内进行。于是真嗣搬出一张担架床，还带了几本医学书籍。他前一天就来过，准备了一些东西。

He perused the anesthetists book, and ran back inside for a quick shopping trip to the hospital's pharmacy. He went to the walk in refrigerator, which was still pretty cold despite the prolonged power loss.  
他翻阅着麻醉师手册，然后跑回室内，迅速去医院的药房采购。他走到那个步入式冷藏柜前，尽管断电已久，里面依然相当冷。

When he returned, Asuka had laid on the gurney, and was breathing deeply. Shinji produced an IV bag, and a needle/catheter. While they had been in the "employ" of NERV, they had both been introduced to basic first aid and lifesaving procedures. He prepared her vein, and stuck her with ease. Fortunately Asuka had good veins that stayed close to the surface. He saw the flash, pushed the catheter in, and pulled the needle. Soon she was getting a good drip of Ringers. Producing the bottle of local, he injected several C.C.s of it into the bag, and slowed the flow down a little.  
当他回来时，明日香已经躺在担架床上，呼吸深沉。真嗣拿出一个静脉注射袋和一根针/导管。在为 NERV“效力”期间，他们俩都接受过基础急救和救生程序的培训。他准备好了她的静脉，轻松地扎了进去。幸运的是，明日香的静脉很好，贴近皮肤表面。他看到闪光，推进导管，拔出针头。很快，她就开始接受良好的林格氏液滴注。拿出局部麻醉药瓶，他向袋中注射了几毫升，并稍微减慢了流速。

"Ok, now give this stuff a minute to start working. You will be awake, but you won't feel anything. If you don't want to watch, turn the other way." Shinji put his hand against her forehead. She was being incredibly brave. He was totally unskilled for what he was doing, and yet she was putting at least her arm if not her life in his hands. He smiled inwardly at the boost in his confidence.  
“好了，现在让这些东西开始起作用。你会保持清醒，但不会感到任何疼痛。如果你不想看，可以转过身去。”真嗣把手放在她的额头上。她表现得非常勇敢。他所做的完全不熟练，而她却至少把她的手臂，甚至可能是生命交到了他的手中。他内心微笑，信心大增。

The work was messy. When the bandage wraps were off, he slowly pulled the wound open, and began separating the sides of the wound. There was a little bleeding. Asuka did not even wince, feeling nothing at all in her arm. Calmly she watched the operation proceed, almost like a third person watching someone else being operated on.  
这工作颇为凌乱。当绷带解开后，他缓缓将伤口拉开，开始分离伤口两侧。有少许出血。明日香连眉头都没皱一下，手臂毫无知觉。她平静地看着手术进行，几乎像是个旁观者，看着别人接受手术。

Using a couple of instruments that he did not know the names of, he pulled the skin apart, and started cleaning away some of the blood clots. There was a little evidence of infection, but nothing really serious. According to the text he could give her some of the listed penicillin derivatives and it would take care of most common infections. The other medical text described gangrenous infection and other life threatening infections, but no evidence of those were present, so after some more work, Shinji carefully started stitching the wound up. A hundred or so small stitches later, he tied off the suture, and cleaned up the area surrounding the wound. Asuka smiled up at him after he pulled off the gloves, and wiped his sweaty brow.  
他使用了几种不知其名的器械，将皮肤拉开，开始清理一些血块。有轻微感染迹象，但并不严重。根据资料，他可以给她一些青霉素衍生物，能应对大多数常见感染。另一本医学书描述了坏疽性感染和其他致命感染，但目前并无此类迹象，所以在进一步处理后，真嗣小心翼翼地开始缝合伤口。缝了上百针后，他系紧了缝线，并清理了伤口周围的区域。摘下手套，擦去额头的汗水后，明日香对他露出了微笑。

Now his hands started to shake as he put his supplies and bloodied instruments away.  
现在，当他收拾起用品和沾血的器械时，双手开始颤抖。

"That went better than I expected. According to this book, for how deep that is, it should be healed enough to be workable in about 3 weeks. Let me dress that again and I think that will be it."  
“情况比我想象的要好。根据这本书的说法，这么深的伤口，大约三周就能愈合到可以处理的程度。让我再给你包扎一次，应该就差不多了。”

He applied some antibiotic ointment, and then wrapped it snugly in gauze, and wrapped that with bandage. "It also says that the suture will dissolve in time, so there is no need to cut and pull it out. Now let's look at that eye."  
他涂了一些抗生素软膏，然后用纱布紧紧包裹，再用绷带缠好。“书上还说，缝线会随时间溶解，所以不需要剪掉和拔出来。现在让我们看看那只眼睛。”

After lifting the pad over the eye, Shinji found that the eye itself was starting to clear up the bruise that the sudden trauma just under it had caused. Also slightly infected, he daubed a little antibiotic on that as well, and put a new pad over it. Once done he carefully extracted the catheter and put a cotton swab over the little needle hole.  
揭开眼睛上的敷料后，真嗣发现眼睛周围的淤青已经开始消退，这是由于眼下的突然创伤造成的。那里也有些轻微感染，他同样涂了些抗生素，然后换上新的敷料。完成后，他小心地拔出导管，并在小针孔上放了一个棉签。

"All right Ms. Soryu, you are free to go. Please stop by the receptionists desk on the way out." While Shinji cleaned up the work area, Asuka grumbled about how he seemed to always have something funny to say recently. Maybe it was his sudden new lease on life. Whatever it was, it at least made him slightly more tolerable.  
"好了，绫波小姐，你可以走了。请在离开时顺便到前台登记一下。" 在真嗣清理工作区域时，明日香抱怨他最近似乎总有有趣的话要说。或许是他的生活突然焕发了新生。不管怎样，至少让他变得稍微能忍受一些了。

"OK, now I want something to eat. I don't know about you, but I am pretty hungry." Asuka stated loudly so that Shinji who was ferrying supplies back into the hospital would hear her. She didn't even know why he was bothering with putting the supplies away.  
"好了，我现在想吃点东西。我不知道你怎么样，但我可是饿坏了。" 明日香大声说道，以便正在将物资搬回医院的真嗣能听到。她甚至不明白他为何还要费心去整理那些物资。

"I was thinking about finding a permanent shelter, like an undamaged house somewhere, and kind of taking it over. The previous owners won't mind. We have to get out of those tents. It was OK for the first couple of days, but now we need to figure out what we want to do." Shinji blinked as he stepped back into the sun.  
"我在考虑找个永久的住处，比如某个未受损的房子，然后占为己有。原主人不会介意的。我们得离开那些帐篷。最初几天还好，但现在我们需要决定下一步该怎么做。" 真嗣眨了眨眼，重新回到阳光下。

"Well, I think we need to get away from this area. I can't stand to look out over the water, and see those white monsters or that hideous head over on the horizon. Of course I don't even know where I want to go."  
"嗯，我觉得我们需要离开这个地方。我无法忍受望向水面，看到那些白色怪物或是地平线上那可怕的头颅。当然，我甚至不知道自己想去哪里。"

"Well we can figure it out. There's a map in the back seat of the car, we can check it out. But first, I think you're right, we need food." As if to accentuate his point, his stomach chose that moment to growl menacingly. A light blush raced across his face.  
""我们可以慢慢想。车后座有张地图，我们可以查看一下。但首先，我觉得你说得对，我们需要食物。"" 仿佛为了强调他的观点，他的肚子恰好在那一刻发出了威胁性的咕噜声。一抹淡淡的红晕迅速掠过他的脸颊。

It was now late morning so breakfast would still be good. Unfortunately raw materials for food were in very short supply now. They would have to live on store bought instant stuff for a while.  
现在已是上午晚些时候，吃早餐应该还合适。不幸的是，食物原材料现在非常匮乏。他们将不得不暂时依赖商店购买的即食食品。

There were a few small convenience stores close by. They entered the first one, and were almost knocked down by the intense rotten stench issuing from the freezers in the back. Holding his nose, Shinji made his way further inside, and brought back some instant miso soup, and some large packages of ramen.  
附近有几家小便利店。他们走进了第一家，却被从后面冰柜里散发出的浓烈腐臭味几乎熏倒。捂着鼻子，真嗣继续深入店内，带回了一些即食味噌汤和几大包拉面。

"I am afraid this was all I could grab. I guess it will have to do." They made their way back to their campsite, and while Shinji rebuilt the fire, Asuka pored over the map.  
“恐怕我只能拿到这些了。我想这应该够了吧。”他们返回营地，真嗣重新生火，而明日香则仔细研究地图。

Soon they each had a steaming bowl of miso, and a hot serving of fish ramen. But they were no closer to figuring out where to go.  
很快，他们每人都有了一碗热腾腾的味噌汤和一份热乎乎的鱼味拉面。但他们仍未找到下一步该去哪里。

"We could go to Aomori or Hirosaki. I hear that it is beautiful in the "springtime". The cherry trees still bloom and they have some wonderful apples." Asuka offered.  
"我们可以去青森或弘前。我听说春天那里很美。樱花依然盛开，而且那里的苹果非常棒。" 明日香提议道。

"Never had Aomori apples before." He said.  
"我以前从没吃过青森的苹果。" 他说。

"Oh, man, Hikari brought one in her lunch one day. It was huge. And bursting with juice. So sweet, and delicious. Mmmmm." She guestured with her hands showing a shape about the size of a softball.  
"哦，天哪，光有一天午餐带了一个。那苹果超大。汁水四溢。超级甜，美味极了。嗯嗯。" 她用手比划着，形状大约有垒球那么大。

"I don't know. Somehow even being only a few hundred miles away, the climate is so much different there. It still snows in the winter time, too cold for my taste. We could visit there or something and get some apples if you like though." Shinji was just finishing his ramen. For being instant stuff it was alright.  
"我不知道。尽管只相隔几百英里，那里的气候却截然不同。冬天依然会下雪，对我来说太冷了。不过，我们可以去那儿逛逛，如果你喜欢的话，还可以带些苹果回来。" 真嗣刚吃完他的拉面。虽然是速食的，但味道还不错。

"Hmm. We could go to Okayama. I heard it's nice."  
"嗯。我们可以去冈山。我听说那里不错。"

"It is. I got to go there a few years ago. Mountains, cool pristine valleys, and close to the water. Want to go there?" It was as good a place as any climate wise, and there were a lot of nice homes and farmland around that area.  
"确实不错。几年前我曾去过那里。有山，有清凉纯净的山谷，靠近水域。想去那儿吗？" 从气候角度来说，那里是个好地方，而且周围有很多漂亮的住宅和农田。

"Yeah! Say, wasn't that show.. what was it called? Tenchi Muyo! Wasn't the shrine near there?"  
"耶！对了，那节目叫什么来着？《天地无用！》！神社是不是就在那附近？"

"Umm, close to there I think. I liked Tenchi."  
"嗯，应该离那不远。我挺喜欢《天地无用》的。"

"Well if the area is anything like the show, I think it will be a perfect place to live."  
"如果那地方跟剧里一样，我觉得会是个理想的居住地。"

They finished up their meals (what there was of it) while finalizing plans. They could take the highways most of the way there. Shinji carefully packed up all of the gear that they had amassed over the last couple of days, and dumped it in the back of the car. He was slowly getting the hang of driving the stick shift.  
他们匆匆吃完饭（虽然没多少），同时敲定计划。大部分路程可以走高速公路。真嗣小心翼翼地将过去几天收集的所有装备打包，扔进车后座。他渐渐习惯了开手动挡。

Asuka helped as well as she could, and soon they were done. With a backward glance, they left the beach, and it was only early afternoon. Unfortunately, on the way out of what was left of Tokyo-3 they realized that the going was not going to be as easy as they had first thought. When the occupants of the vehicles on the road during Third Impact were taken, their vehicles came to a crashing, violent stop, and they littered the road on both sides, nearly obstructing the whole road in some places.  
明日香也尽可能帮忙，很快他们就收拾完毕。回头望了一眼，他们离开了海滩，那时才刚过中午。不幸的是，在离开残存的第三新东京市的路上，他们意识到事情并不像最初想的那样简单。第三次冲击时，路上的车辆里的人被带走后，车辆猛烈地停下，散落在道路两侧，有些地方几乎完全阻塞了道路。

"You know, I think we may have to figure something else out. This car is not going to make it through all this wreckage, and if it gets any worse, we won't make it out of here. We need something smaller." Shinji stated as he swerved around another burnt out wreck.  
“你知道吗，我觉得我们可能得另想办法。这辆车没法穿过这么多废墟，如果情况再恶化，我们根本出不去。我们需要更小的交通工具。”真嗣一边说着，一边避开另一辆烧毁的残骸。

"Well, we can stop in Gotenba right up here, and figure something out. How about bicycles?" She offered.  
“好吧，我们可以在这儿的御殿场停一下，再想个办法。骑自行车怎么样？”她提议道。

"No, not if we want to get there this year. Besides we have to bring supplies, and I don't really feel like pedaling up all those hills."  
“不，如果我们要在今年到达那里的话，那可不行。再说我们还得带补给品，我也不太想蹬着自行车爬那些山坡。”

Then the redhead had an idea. "How about motorcycles?" Asuka brightened. She liked the sound of that. She had often wanted to ride one.  
接着，红发女孩灵机一动。“摩托车怎么样？”明日香眼前一亮。她喜欢这个主意。她一直想骑摩托车。

"I have never tried that before." He said, and catching the almost frustrated reaction from Asuka, he added, "But there is not time like the present to try!"  
"我以前从未尝试过这个。" 他说，捕捉到明日香几乎沮丧的反应，他又补充道，"但没有什么比现在更适合尝试的了！"

"Yeah, that's what I thought you were going to say. Shinji, are you sure about this?" A look of concern and excitement combined on her face.  
"是啊，我就知道你会这么说。真嗣，你确定要这么做吗？" 她的脸上混合着关切与兴奋。

"Well I think it is a good idea. It may also be the only way. We can't drive anything big, but we have to have something powerful, yet maneuverable. And besides, there is nothing wrong with knowing a little something about nearly everything. I had never really felt like doing something new before. But today, I get to." Asuka nodded, hoping that Shinji's positive outlook would hold up.  
"我觉得这是个好主意。这可能也是唯一的方法。我们开不了什么大车，但我们需要既强大又灵活的东西。而且，了解一点关于几乎所有事情的知识并没有什么坏处。我以前从未真正想尝试新事物。但今天，我有机会了。" 明日香点头，希望真嗣的积极态度能持续下去。

35 wrecks later they approached the outskirts of the city of Gotenba, and started looking for a place to pilfer some motorcycles. At first all they could find were real speed bikes. "Crotch-rockets" Asuka called them. That would not do. The needed something that could hold their gear, and that they could cruise around in. Not something built to pull the paint off of cars when it passed them.  
35 次事故后，他们接近了御殿场市的外围，开始寻找偷窃摩托车的地方。起初他们找到的只是真正的赛车。明日香称之为“裆火箭”。这可不行。他们需要能装载装备、适合巡航的车辆，而不是那种经过时能把汽车漆都刮掉的赛车。

After an hour of looking, they finally located some motorcycles that would suit their needs. The owner must have really liked the Indian motorcycle. After looking through the house and garage, they found 7 motorcycles of different types. 5 were whole, and two were partially taken apart. It looked almost as though he had been polishing a part when he had been taken.  
经过一个小时的搜寻，他们终于找到了符合需求的摩托车。车主一定非常喜欢印第安摩托车。在检查了房子和车库后，他们发现了 7 辆不同类型的摩托车。其中 5 辆完好无损，另外两辆则部分拆解。看起来他似乎是在打磨零件时被带走的。

Fortunately he was meticulous with his motorcycles; they were in perfect shape. He did not collect them just to look at them, either. They were gassed and ready to go. He also had all sorts of stuff with them. They found manuals, picture books of various Indian cycles, a helmet for each. Every bike also had saddlebags. Shinji and Asuka looked though them all trying to figure out which ones the might want to take. Shinji picked out one that the manual identified as a 1947 Indian Chief. It was old, but it was very well taken care of. It looked new. The one on the cover was blue, but this one was painted jet black, and had pin-striping flowing along its gentle curves. Everything about it looked brand new. Even the Indian head light on the front fender and the black leather saddlebags with zinc studs hanging on either side of the seat.  
幸运的是，他对摩托车非常细心；它们都处于完美状态。他不仅仅是为了观赏而收藏它们。它们都加满了油，随时可以出发。他还为它们准备了各种配件。他们找到了手册、各种印度摩托车的图册、每辆摩托车对应的头盔。每辆摩托车还配有马鞍包。真嗣和明日香仔细查看，试图决定要带走哪些。真嗣选了一辆手册上标明为 1947 年印度酋长的摩托车。虽然年代久远，但保养得非常好。看起来崭新。封面上的那辆是蓝色的，但这辆漆成了乌黑色，并配有沿着其柔和曲线流动的细条纹。一切都显得崭新无比。甚至连前挡泥板上的印度头形车灯和座位两侧挂着的带有锌钉的黑色皮革马鞍包也是如此。

"You sure you are going to be alright to handle one, Asuka? These look like powerful machines." Not taking his eyes off of the motorcycle.  
“你确定能驾驭得了这些，明日香？这些看起来都是强劲的机器。”他目光未离摩托车。

"You automatically think that you will be able to handle it, Shinji? Yeah I think I can manage. I can use my arm well enough, just nothing strenuous." She walked over to a newer cycle. It's accompanying manual was much newer and identified it as a 2000 Indian Chief Vintage. The deep red paintjob showed her reflection, and looking closely she could see tiny lines that upon even closer inspection she saw was painted wood grain. It was custom. "Wow."  
"你自然而然地认为你能应付得了，真嗣？嗯，我觉得我可以。我的手臂用起来还不错，只是不能做太费劲的事。" 她走向一辆较新的摩托车。它的配套手册更新，标明这是一辆 2000 年的印第安酋长复古款。深红色的漆面映出了她的倒影，仔细一看，她发现那些细小的线条在更近距离观察下竟是绘制的木纹。这是定制的。"哇。"

"I really don't want to mess up such a nice motorcycle trying to learn how to ride it. Want to start out on some of those others we saw on our way here? We can mess them up without feeling so guilty." Shinji nodded his head outside.  
"我真的不想在学骑车时弄坏这么漂亮的摩托车。想从我们来的路上看到的那些开始吗？我们可以随便折腾它们，不会感到那么内疚。" 真嗣点头向外面示意。"

"Yeah I agree. I have never really appreciated how beautiful one might be."  
"是啊，我同意。我从未真正欣赏过一辆摩托车能有多美。"

They exited the garage, and drove back along the road a ways and found a couple Kawasaki crotch-rockets and set about figuring them out.  
他们离开了车库，沿着道路行驶了一段距离，找到了几辆川崎小钢炮，并开始研究起来。

Since the motorcycle that Shinji had picked out did not have an electric ignition on it, he was sure that he would have to get used to kick starting it. The first time he tried it, he didn't keep his foot on the kick start in the follow through, and it sprang back and nearly broke his shin. The pain was excruciating, but it was a lesson well learned. Don't do that again. Plus, Asuka teased him enough for him not to forget.  
由于真嗣挑选的摩托车没有电启动装置，他确信自己得习惯用脚启动。第一次尝试时，他没有在后续动作中保持脚踩启动杆，结果启动杆弹回，差点踢断他的胫骨。疼痛难忍，但这是个深刻的教训。别再这么做了。此外，明日香也嘲笑了他一番，让他难以忘怀。

After a few more tries, the engine even turned over, and sputtered a bit, and one more hearty kick got it going for real. Retracting the kick stand, he focused on the transmission control. It was on the handlebars, not on a gear shift lever like on the bike he had picked out. Well he would have to figure that one out himself. The manual could help too.  
再试了几次后，引擎终于转动起来，发出一阵噼啪声，再用力一踢，它真的启动了。收回支架，他专注于变速器控制。它位于车把上，而不是像他挑选的那辆摩托车那样在换挡杆上。好吧，他得自己弄明白这一点。手册也能提供帮助。

Shifting from neutral to first, he slowly let off of the clutch, and gave it a little gas, and was surprised by the initial jump forward, but after that, the motorcycle crept away from it's parking spot, and he slowly gave it more gas, pulling his feet up to the stirrups. He let off of the gas, and hit the clutch and let the bike come back to a stop, allowing it to idle while he looked back to Asuka.  
他从空挡换到一挡，缓缓松开离合器，轻踩油门，起初的突然前冲让他有些惊讶，但随后摩托车便缓缓驶离停车位，他逐渐加大油门，双脚抬起放在踏板上。他松开油门，踩下离合器，让摩托车停下，让它怠速运转，同时回头看向明日香。

Hers was an electric ignition, so she hit the ignition button, and she was rewarded with a deep slow rumble. She mimicked Shinji's movements, and jerk- rode hers up to where he was waiting, then passed him, and began to speed up. So long as she did not flex her left arm too much it only had a dull ache.  
她的摩托车是电启动的，所以她按下启动按钮，随即听到一阵低沉缓慢的轰鸣。她模仿真嗣的动作，猛地骑车来到他等待的地方，然后超过他，开始加速。只要她不过度伸展左臂，就只有隐隐的酸痛。

The road was a nice straight one with no cars wrecked on it, so they could practice and grow used to the motorcycles in relative safety.  
这条路笔直且没有被撞毁的车辆，因此他们可以在相对安全的环境中练习并熟悉摩托车。

Shinji, opened his up, and sped up to catch up with Asuka who was reaching the high end of first gear by now. She hit the clutch, shifted right into second gear, released and put more gas on it. Shinji tried to do, ground some gears, then shifted into third a little better. He found riding was much easier than he had originally thought it would be. With a little more work, he could be relatively certain they would have no trouble with the collector's bikes.  
真嗣打开油门，加速追赶已经达到一档高速的明日香。她踩下离合器，迅速换入二档，松开离合并加大油门。真嗣尝试着操作，磨合了几下齿轮，然后稍好地换入三档。他发现骑车比他原先想象的要容易得多。再稍加练习，他就能相对确定他们不会在收藏家的摩托车上遇到麻烦。

Nearing the end of the road, they slowed down almost to a stop, and turned around, heading back the other way, testing the speed this time. Shinji was still amazed of the power in the little vehicle. Just a little gas went a long way.  
接近道路尽头时，他们几乎停了下来，然后掉头，朝相反方向返回，这次测试速度。真嗣仍然对这辆小车的动力感到惊讶。只需一点油门就能走很远。

They rode around the area for another half-hour or so, before coming back to the starting point. Shinji's side's hurt. The bouncing action on a nearby gravel road had really hurt his back. It felt like he had been kidney punched. Getting off the bike, the pain went away with a little walking around, and stretching. Asuka parked hers beside him, and got off of hers as well.  
他们在该地区又骑行了大约半小时，才回到起点。真嗣的侧腰疼得厉害。在附近碎石路上的颠簸让他的背部真的很痛，感觉像是被人打了一拳肾脏。下车后，稍微走动和伸展一下，疼痛就消失了。明日香把她的车停在他旁边，也下了车。

The darkening sky was threatening nightfall, so they decided to call it quits on the motorcycles, and found a place to camp. Neither really felt good about occupying someone's house. Especially not sleeping in their bed.  
天色渐暗，预示着夜晚即将来临，于是他们决定结束摩托车之旅，找了个地方露营。两人都不太愿意占用别人的房子，尤其是睡在他们的床上。

Shinji fixed dinner on a propane camp stove that he had liberated from someone's shed, and they watched the stars come out sporting full stomachs and heads full of thought. The day had been eventful. Shinji had enjoyed it. He supposed that he had never allowed his adventuring spirit out. This was an adventure. A Great Adventure. And despite the things that he had witnessed recently, he was enjoying himself thoroughly. Perhaps this was the freedom that he had wanted. Semi-freedom. Freedom from other peoples rules. Freedom from the problems of a hundred societies trying to get along. Freedom from those who wanted more power.  
真嗣从某人棚子里拿来的丙烷露营炉上做好了晚饭，他们吃饱了肚子，思绪万千地看着星星一颗颗亮起。这一天真是多事之秋。真嗣很享受。他觉得他从未让自己的探险精神释放出来。这是一场冒险。一场伟大的冒险。尽管最近目睹了许多事情，他还是玩得很尽兴。也许这就是他想要的自由。半自由。摆脱他人规则的自由。摆脱试图和睦相处的百种社会问题的自由。摆脱那些渴望更多权力的人的自由。

With no lights on to give off light pollution, they marveled at the millions upon billions of stars that presented themselves in the night's sky. On most nights they could see only a few stars due to the harsh lights in the city, but in the pitch-blackness, the sky was filled with them.  
没有灯光造成光污染，他们惊叹于夜空中呈现出的亿万颗星星。大多数夜晚，由于城市的强烈灯光，他们只能看到几颗星星，但在这种漆黑一片的环境中，天空布满了星星。

The days events, while exciting, had drained Shinji, so after a while stargazing, he decided to hit the sack. Asuka stayed up for a while, thinking through the last few days. She picked apart her feelings, and analyzed her thoughts.  
尽管今天的活动令人兴奋，但也让真嗣感到疲惫不堪，所以在观星一段时间后，他决定去睡觉。明日香则多待了一会儿，思考着过去几天的事情。她剖析自己的情感，分析自己的想法。

Sighing she looked up, and took in the stars one more time. Flexing her hand, feeling the sharp pain flow up and down her arm, she whispered "Thank you, Shinji. For everything." And then she went to her own bed.  
她叹了口气，再次抬头凝望星空。活动着手掌，感受着手臂上下传来的锐痛，她轻声说道：“谢谢你，真嗣。为了这一切。”随后，她回到了自己的床上。

Ringers- AKA Lactated Ringers Solution. Ringers is a type of intravenous drip. Consists of electrolyte solution, and is used to replenish fluid and electrolyte levels to maintain proper electrical conductance in blood system. Electrolytes are essential to the body. They are what allow water to conduct electricity. Totally pure water is electrically insular. Will not conduct electricity at all. I have known fellow Infantrymen who give these to themselves before long road marches. You will generally totally soak a full set of BDUs in sweat before you finish the march so it is important to hydrate... When you get done with a bag of IV, you feel like a million bucks though.  
林格氏液——即林格乳酸溶液。林格氏液是一种静脉滴注液，由电解质溶液组成，用于补充体液和电解质水平，以维持血液系统中的适当电导率。电解质对机体至关重要，它们是使水能够导电的关键。完全纯净的水是电绝缘的，根本不会导电。我认识一些步兵战友，他们在长途行军前会给自己注射这种液体。通常在行军结束前，你会完全汗湿一整套 BDU 作战服，因此补水非常重要……当你用完一袋静脉注射液后，你会感觉精力充沛。

AT Field theory- Those of you who are unfamiliar with AT Field theory should look for the Eva Mailing list homepage at . There are extensive posts on how the AT Fields work for humans, Evas and Angels, and the dynamics and ideas behind their use and function. For the most part, I have adopted some views and rejected others. AT Fields are described in the story as I think of them.

---
Due to the early bed time the night before, both teens were up bright and early the next morning, ready to tackle the new day, and their continuing adventure. Unfortunately there was a convenience store nearby, so they had some wholesome junk food for breakfast. They ate quickly, anxious to get back on the road. Shinji, had taken the pages they needed out of the map, and folded them up, then began unloading the items they wanted to keep from the car, and figuring out how to put them all on the bikes.  
由于前一晚早睡，两位少年次日清晨早早醒来，精神饱满地准备迎接新的一天和继续的冒险。不幸的是，附近有一家便利店，所以他们早餐吃了些健康的垃圾食品。他们迅速吃完，急切地想要重新上路。真嗣已经从地图上取出所需的页码并折叠好，然后开始从车上卸下他们想要保留的物品，并考虑如何将它们全部放在自行车上。

They divided up the supplies, deciding to put equal amounts on the bikes. But before they started actually putting things on them, Shinji suggested that they test out the bikes, and make sure that they are what they want.  
他们将补给品均分，决定在自行车上放置等量的物品。但在实际开始装载之前，真嗣建议他们先测试一下自行车，确保这是他们想要的。

So, releasing the brakes, and retracting the kickstand, they wheeled the motorcycles out of the garage they were in. These were very heavy. The manuals put them at about 650 to 700 lbs each dry. They would have to be very careful to keep them from falling. They would probably not get one back up if it fell over. Even with both of them lifting.  
于是，松开刹车，收起支架，他们将摩托车推出了车库。这些摩托车非常重，手册上标明每辆干重约 650 至 700 磅。他们必须非常小心，以免它们倒下。一旦倒下，他们可能无法再将其扶起，即使两人合力。

It was much the same as the test rides the day before. Except instead of leaning forward with your feet directly under or behind you, these were designed to allow the rider to sit upright, with feet in front of you. Shinji managed to kick start the motorcycle on the second try this time. And playing with the shifter, he put some gas on it while releasing the clutch, and rumbled off. Asuka was right behind him, pouring on the gas. They rode up and down the road several times, allowing themselves to become familiar with the gear shifting systems and braking on the motorcycles.  
这与前一天的试骑大致相同。只是这次不是脚直接位于身体下方或后方前倾，而是设计成让骑手直立坐着，双脚在前。这次真嗣在第二次尝试时成功地用脚启动了摩托车。他一边摆弄着换挡器，一边在松开离合器的同时加油，轰鸣着出发了。明日香紧随其后，猛踩油门。他们在路上来回骑行了几次，让自己熟悉摩托车的换挡系统和刹车。

When they both felt that they had grown accustomed to the controls, they pulled back into the garage, and turned the motorcycles off.  
当他们都觉得已经习惯了操控时，便将摩托车驶回车库，并熄了火。

They had laid everything out that they would be taking, and had even divided it up, but looking at it a little more, Shinji was afraid that there was just too much. 2 Tents, 2 sleeping bags, the cook stove, some waterproof bags with clothes, some food, and a first aid kit.  
他们已经把所有要带的东西都摆了出来，甚至还分好了类，但再仔细一看，真嗣担心东西实在太多了。两顶帐篷，两个睡袋，炉具，一些装着衣物的防水袋，食物，还有急救包。

"Hey Asuka? I don't think this is going to work." He said as she walked up next to him.  
“嘿，明日香？我觉得这行不通。”他说着，她走到了他身边。

"What do you mean?" "你这是什么意思？"

"I think we may have too much stuff. It won't all fit on the bikes."  
"我觉得我们的东西太多了。自行车上装不下。"

"Well what can we still get rid of.?"  
"那我们还能扔掉些什么呢？"

"Well we need the clothes, the food, the stove, and the first aid kit. I was also going to take that set of tools over there in case we have trouble. We need the sleeping bags. Now I know you won't like this, but we only need one tent. Those are big enough for two." He knew it was coming before he even completed the thought. Well, come as it may. There was no way around it without finding some other form of transportation.  
"衣服、食物、炉子、急救包这些是必需的。我还打算带上那边的工具套装，以防遇到麻烦。睡袋也得带上。我知道你不会喜欢这个，但我们只需要一个帐篷。那些帐篷足够两个人用了。" 他还没说完就预感到她的反应了。唉，该来的总会来。除非找到其他交通工具，否则这是绕不开的。

Asuka scowled deeply, crossing one arm slowly over the other. Shinji could tell that she was weighing the options. "You just want to do that so that you can take advantage of me. I know you, you pervert!"  
明日香皱着眉头，缓缓地将一只手臂交叉在另一只上。真嗣看得出她在权衡选择。“你只是想那样做，好占我便宜。我了解你，你这个变态！”

"Oh, give me a break, Asuka. You know what? If I wanted to take advantage of you, don't you think I would have done it by now? I could have put some general anesthetic in your bag yesterday, and you would have gone under in a few minutes. I could have done anything to you that I wanted, and there would have been nothing you could do to stop me. You would never know what hit you. So don't give me that crap."  
“哦，饶了我吧，明日香。你知道吗？如果我想占你便宜，你以为我不会早就这样做了吗？我昨天本可以在你的包里放些全身麻醉药，几分钟后你就会昏过去。我可以对你做任何我想做的事，而你根本无法阻止我。你永远不会知道发生了什么。所以别跟我来这套。”

Asuka blinked, and wondered at Shinji. He was getting angry, and she knew that he was good as his word. He looked at her a little perturbed, and after a moment she buckled. She waved her hand and rolled her eyes. "Fine, leave one behind. I believe you Shinji. Old habits are kind of hard to break, you know?" A small smile graced her lovely face.  
明日香眨了眨眼，对真嗣感到疑惑。他开始生气了，她知道他言出必行。他有些不安地看着她，过了一会儿她屈服了。她挥了挥手，翻了个白眼。“好吧，留下一个。我相信你，真嗣。你知道，旧习惯很难改掉，对吧？”她美丽的脸上露出一丝微笑。

Shinji lost his frown, and gave her a little smile. "I know, Asuka. I just wanted you to know that I am not a pervert. C'mon, let's get this stuff packed."  
真嗣收起了皱眉，向她微微一笑。“我知道，明日香。我只是想让你知道我不是个变态。来吧，我们把这些东西打包。”

Taking out some bungee cords that he had packed away, they fastened the tent and sleeping bags to the area just behind the seat, and packed the rest into the saddle bags. Shinji retrieved the tool kit and put that in his bag too.  
他拿出一些之前收好的弹力绳，将帐篷和睡袋固定在座椅后方的区域，并将其余物品装入马鞍包。真嗣还取出了工具包，也放进了自己的包里。

It was a little after 10:00 a.m. when they pulled out of the garage, leaving it for the last time. They turned onto Highway 25 South, and weaving in and out of various crashed and burned out vehicles, they made decent time. What with the road conditions, they averaged about 40 miles an hour due to having to slow down to avoid cars, and keeping things slow so that they could get used to the rides. Shinji was having the time of his life. He thought to himself. 'This is great'. You did not have to think about much while riding, just enjoy watching the countryside flowing past you. Asuka too was having fun. The wind felt good waving her hair out behind her like a long horizontal flame. They both learned quickly enough not to smile too widely while riding. The bugs, which were out in force, were not really that tasty.  
大约上午十点刚过，他们驶出了车库，最后一次离开。他们转向南方的 25 号高速公路，穿梭于各种撞毁和烧毁的车辆之间，行进得相当顺利。由于路况原因，他们平均时速约为 40 英里，需要减速避让车辆，并保持缓慢以便适应骑行。真嗣正享受着这段时光。他暗自想着：'这太棒了'。骑行时无需多想，只需欣赏窗外不断掠过的乡村风光。明日香也同样乐在其中。风吹动她的长发，宛如一道横向的火焰。两人很快就学会了骑行时不要笑得太开，因为那些成群结队的虫子实在不怎么美味。

So far they had only seen insects as the only other life around except themselves and the plants, but they saw all kinds of wildlife and domestic animals on their way.  
到目前为止，除了自己和植物，他们只见到昆虫是周围唯一的生命迹象，但在旅途中，他们看到了各种各样的野生动物和家畜。

By the time they decided to stop, they had traveled about 160 miles. A little less than halfway to their destination. They had stopped a ways back to fill the gas tanks. A few minutes hand pumping gas, a bite to eat, and they had gotten back on their way.  
当他们决定停下来时，已经行驶了大约 160 英里。还不到目的地的一半路程。他们之前停下来给油箱加满了油。几分钟手动泵油，吃点东西，然后就继续上路了。

It was not quite 4:00 p.m. when they decided to stop. Both of them had sore butts. Not a good idea to ride that far in one day on your first real ride. They also both had a bit of a sunburn on their exposed skin. Not bad, just singed.  
他们决定停下来时，时间还不到下午 4 点。两人的屁股都酸痛不已。第一天骑行就不该一天骑这么远。他们暴露在外的皮肤也都有点晒伤，不算严重，只是轻微晒红。

They made camp that night at a roadside stop that had bathrooms, a little convenience store, and vacated vendor stalls. The water was still running testifying that somewhere there was a water tank with a working water pump in it. The convenience store was all right. They did not have anything that would decay like meat so it was still clean and pleasant smelling. Shinji and Asuka took this chance to restock on some hygene items, and searched out some food. Candy was in abundance, but after the junk food breakfast they needed some real food. Unfortunately this was a conveniance store, not a grocery store.  
当晚，他们在路边的一个休息站扎营，那里有卫生间、一家小便利店和空置的摊位。自来水仍在流动，证明某个地方的水箱里有一台仍在工作的水泵。便利店还算不错，因为没有易腐烂的肉类，所以依然干净且气味宜人。真嗣和明日香趁机补充了一些卫生用品，并寻找了一些食物。糖果很丰富，但经过早上的垃圾食品早餐后，他们需要一些真正的食物。可惜这里只是便利店，不是杂货店。

They ate odds and ends that night. Then they talked about how different the world was now. The stars were just as nice as the night before, but they did not stay up long enough to look at them for long. Shinji set up the tent, and Asuka went into the restrooms and washed herself off as best she could. By the time she was finished, Shinji had the tent up, and the sleeping bags off of the motorcycles. She spread out the bags while Shinji took his turn in the restrooms.  
那晚他们吃了些零碎的食物，然后聊起了世界如今的变化。星空和前一晚一样美丽，但他们没有熬夜太久去长时间欣赏。真嗣搭起了帐篷，而明日香则去了洗手间尽可能地清洗自己。等她回来时，真嗣已经搭好了帐篷，并从摩托车上取下了睡袋。她铺开睡袋，而真嗣则去洗手间轮到他清洗。

It was a little cramped, but Asuka didn't complain. It was necessary, and there was nothing really wrong with it. It was not like they were going to... (A blush was building). And even if they did ... Asuka shook her head to clear it, then she laid down and tried to go to sleep.  
虽然有点挤，但明日香并没有抱怨。这是必要的，而且也没什么不好。并不像他们要……（她的脸颊泛起了红晕）。即使他们真的……明日香摇了摇头，试图清空思绪，然后躺下尝试入睡。

Shinji returned, and lay down also, turning over a once or twice to get comfortable. Asuka sighed next to him, and he spoke softly to her. "Asuka, you awake?" She nodded though facing away from him. "Well I just wanted to say, thanks for being with me. You know? I don't think that being alone would have been good for me. I don't think that I would have been able to hack it." Asuka knew exactly what he meant, though unspoken. "So, I'm glad you are here." And with that he rolled over and found sleep.  
真嗣回来了，也躺了下来，翻了几次身以寻求舒适。明日香在他旁边叹了口气，他轻声对她说：“明日香，你醒着吗？”她虽然背对着他，但还是点了点头。“我只是想说，谢谢你陪着我。你知道吗？我觉得如果我一个人，可能撑不下去。我不认为我能挺过去。”明日香完全明白他的意思，尽管没有说出口。“所以，我很高兴你在这里。”说完，他翻过身，很快进入了梦乡。

Asuka liked the sound of being appreciated. Especially just for her presence. It felt good to be wanted and needed by someone. Even if it did come from Shinji. She really was glad to be alive now. But it brought questions to mind for her. What were they here for? Why only two people left on Earth? Had she willed herself back? Had her mother? That was awkward, especially with the two being her and Shinji. It was like someone had a sick sense of humor. They put her back here and say "Asuka, you are now responsible for the fate of the whole human species. And your fate is… this guy." What do you say to that? What do you feel about that? The sense of responsibility was enough to drive her crazy.  
明日香喜欢被欣赏的感觉，尤其是仅仅因为她的存在。被人需要和渴望的感觉真好，即便这份感觉来自真嗣。她现在真的很庆幸自己还活着。但这同时也带来了一些疑问。他们在这里是为了什么？为什么地球上只剩下两个人？是她自己希望回来的吗？还是她的母亲？这很尴尬，尤其是当这两个人是她自己和真嗣时。这就像某人有着一种病态的幽默感。他们把她带回这里，然后说：“明日香，你现在要负责整个人类的命运。而你的命运是……这个人。”你对此有何感想？这种责任感足以让她发疯。

But, in the end, it meant one thing really. She looked over at Shinji. His back was to her, and he was asleep already anyway. What the hell was she supposed to do? She sighed, basically she really had no choice. If she didn't, she would feel ... She forced herself to stop thinking about it. Whatever happens … happens. Just as she was finally going to sleep, she wondered what the next day would bring.  
但最终，这意味着一件事。她看向真嗣，他的背对着她，而且他已经睡着了。她到底该怎么办？她叹了口气，基本上她真的别无选择。如果她不做，她会感到……她强迫自己停止思考。无论发生什么……都会发生。就在她终于要入睡时，她想知道明天会带来什么。

### Chapter 4 Day6

The morning's dawn was cold, and misty. Dew had formed in the night, and everything was at least a little wet from the condensation. Shinji awoke to a soft noise beside him. It was Asuka, and she was crying. He listened to her for a few minutes, not wanting to interrupt her. She breathed deeply several times and soon she got herself to calm down.  
清晨的曙光寒冷而朦胧。昨夜凝结的露水，使得万物都或多或少带着湿气。真嗣被身旁的一阵轻响唤醒。是明日香，她在哭泣。他静静地听了她几分钟，不想打断她。她深呼吸了几次，不久便自己平静了下来。

Earlier that morning, she woke up to find that she was curled up behind Shinji, hugging him for warmth. She was glad that he had not woken up first. It felt good like that, lying there behind him, soaking up and sharing body heat. But it did not feel right for her to do that. They had no relationship to really justify being that close, and she felt that if she was going to... to… cuddle, it would be with someone she loved. And then she realized it again. There was no one else. Everyone was gone. Something had been taken away nearly a week ago. It was opportunity. Infinite permutations of her life were taken from her nearly in an instant. Now all that existed were two. Two outcomes. Two people. Two realities. Two possible futures.  
那天清晨，她醒来时发现自己蜷缩在真嗣身后，抱着他取暖。她很庆幸他没有先醒来。那样躺在他身后，吸收并分享体温的感觉很好。但这样做对她来说并不合适。他们之间并没有什么关系能真正证明这种亲密是合理的，她觉得如果要...要...拥抱，那应该是和所爱的人。然后她再次意识到这一点。没有其他人了。所有人都消失了。大约一周前，有些东西被夺走了。那是机会。她生活中的无限可能几乎在一瞬间被夺走了。现在只剩下两种。两种结果。两个人。两种现实。两种可能的未来。

She sighed deeply, and wiped the tears from her face. She hated the puffy feeling of her face after she cried. To ensure that Shinji would not know of it, she got up and left the tent to go wash her face, and collect her thoughts. She wondered how they would get through all this.  
她深深地叹了口气，擦去脸上的泪水。她讨厌哭过之后脸上浮肿的感觉。为了确保真嗣不会察觉，她起身离开帐篷去洗脸，整理思绪。她不知道他们将如何度过这一切。

Shinji waited for a few minutes, and heard the sink running in the bathroom. Asuka walked around a little, and then came back out. She sniffed a few times, and sat down outside the tent. Maybe she needed to meditate.  
真嗣等了几分钟，听到浴室里水槽的水声。明日香四处走动了一会儿，然后又走了出来。她吸了吸鼻子，坐在帐篷外。或许她需要冥想一下。

Asuka was not meditating. In fact, she was getting hungry and annoyed. Surely Shinji would get up soon. Finally after about 15 minutes of waiting, she tore open the door of the tent, and threw a bottle of sunscreen at him bopping him in the head. "Hey! Wake up! You gonna sleep all day?" Shinji grumbled and got right up. Somewhere in the back of Asuka's mind she wondered if he had been up all along. Much later she knew the truth.  
明日香并没有在冥想。实际上，她感到饥饿和烦躁。真嗣肯定很快就会起床。终于，在等待了大约 15 分钟后，她猛地拉开帐篷的门，扔了一瓶防晒霜过去，正好砸在他的头上。“嘿！醒醒！你打算睡一整天吗？”真嗣咕哝着，立刻坐了起来。在明日香脑海的某个角落，她怀疑他是不是一直醒着。很久以后，她才知道真相。

"What has gotten into you this morning? Can't I even get some sleep around here." Shinji said with a tinge of anger.  
“你今天早上怎么了？我连一点觉都不能睡吗？”真嗣带着一丝怒气说道。

She stood up facing him, with her arms akimbo shaking her head as she spoke. "Well if all you want to do is sleep, why didn't you choose a world where you could sleep all the time?" Asuka snapped back.  
她站起身面对着他，双手叉腰，摇着头说道：“既然你只想睡觉，为什么不选择一个可以随时睡觉的世界呢？”明日香反唇相讥。

Shinji put his shoes on, and angrily stormed off to the bathroom. If she was going to be like this today, he definitely did not want to be around her. Shinji washed up, and left to stalk the isles of the convenience store in search of something that they could eat. The only breakfast related items were some cereals and toaster pastries. Things that people on the road could eat with their hands if they wanted. He got some orange juice out of one of the still working fridges, checked the carton, making sure it was super-pasteurized. Then he opened the top and smelled it. There was a good chance that it would be starting to ferment by now even if it was pasteurized, but it smelled OK and tasted even better. Taking a couple more out, as well as some bottled water and the pastries, he exited to rejoin grumpy Asuka.
真嗣穿上鞋，生气地冲向浴室。如果她今天要这样，他绝对不想和她在一起。信治洗漱完毕，在便利店的货架上寻找可以吃的东西。与早餐有关的东西只有一些麦片和烤面包。这些都是路上的人们可以用手抓着吃的东西。他从一个还能用的冰箱里拿出一些橙汁，检查了一下纸箱，确保是经过超级巴氏消毒的。然后，他打开瓶盖闻了闻。即使是经过巴氏杀菌的，现在也很有可能已经开始发酵了，但闻起来还不错，味道更好。他又拿了几个出来，还有一些瓶装水和糕点，就出去和脾气暴躁的明日香会合了。

They sat and ate in silence, not even looking at each other. Shinji was sorry that he had snapped at her, but she should have had some more patience. He was only giving her some room and some privacy to deal with her feelings. The thought did occur to him that this is how she deals with her feelings. Anytime she has something bothering her, she gets angry and mean. He sighed and allowed his anger to leave him.  
他们默默地坐着吃饭，甚至没有看对方一眼。真嗣对自己对她发火感到抱歉，但她本该再多些耐心。他只是想给她一些空间和隐私来处理她的情绪。他想到这可能是她处理情绪的方式。每当有什么事困扰她时，她就会变得愤怒和刻薄。他叹了口气，让怒气从自己身上消散。

They packed as soon as they were done eating, and cleaned up the area. When Shinji went to kick-start his bike, the kick-start swung around, and banged his shin again, eliciting a yelp of pain. Asuka just laughed. Shinji's face turned red, and for a moment he was thinking dark thoughts indeed about the smirking red head. He shot her a squinting angered look, and she piped down. Frowning he tried again, and was rewarded with a deep rumbling sound of horsepower. Not even waiting for Asuka, he let off the clutch and quickly drove away, gaining speed. He watched her in the mirror, mouth agape, amazed that he would just take off without her. He knew though that after her initial shock, she would recover and catch up to him.  
他们一吃完饭就开始打包，并清理了现场。当真嗣去踢启动他的摩托车时，启动杆转了一圈，又撞到了他的胫骨，疼得他大叫一声。明日香只是笑了笑。真嗣的脸涨得通红，有那么一会儿，他确实对那个得意洋洋的红发女孩产生了阴暗的想法。他眯起眼睛，愤怒地瞪了她一眼，她这才安静下来。他皱着眉头又试了一次，这次得到了引擎深沉的轰鸣声。他甚至没等明日香，就松开离合器，迅速驶离，加快速度。他从后视镜里看着她，嘴巴张得大大的，惊讶于他会就这样丢下她。但他知道，在她最初的震惊之后，她会恢复过来并追上他。

Within a minute, he heard her motorcycle coming up behind him, and when he hit a straight stretch of road, sure enough she popped around the corner behind him and was quickly catching up to him. Her helmet now obscured any facial clues as to her mood but he could imagine what it was. 'Well', he thought to him, 'If she didn't like it, then maybe she should stop dishing it out.'  
不出一分钟，他就听到她的摩托车从后面追了上来，当他驶入一段直路时，果然她从拐角处冒了出来，迅速逼近他。她的头盔遮住了表情，无法判断她的情绪，但他能想象到她的心情。'好吧'，他心想，'如果她不喜欢这样，那也许她应该停止挑衅。'

While the former Third Child was riding, as there were fewer cars on the road in this area, he had time to think about his companion in depth. He figured that if she was ever going to stop being mean to him, he would have to do something about it himself. She was never going to change on her own. Although inexplicably, he now realized that she was being much kinder to him recently. Maybe that is just because he was the only person around. He hoped that she was not going to try and ride the line. Be just nice enough to him for him to stay with her. That would infuriate him more than anything else, for someone to want to be with you, but not want to be nice to you. It was an odd paradox that he knew he would never figure out.  
当这位前第三适格者骑行时，由于这条路上车辆较少，他有时间深入思考他的同伴。他觉得如果她要停止对他刻薄，他必须自己采取行动。她自己永远不会改变。尽管莫名其妙地，他现在意识到她最近对他友善多了。也许只是因为他周围没有其他人。他希望她不会试图走钢丝，只是对他足够好以便他留在她身边。这种既要在一起又不愿对他好的矛盾，比任何事都更让他恼火。这是一个他知道自己永远无法解开的奇怪悖论。

As he was driving, he felt nature's call, so he put his turn signal on, and pulled off to the side of the road. Asuka stopped just ahead of his bike and shut hers off as well, but she stayed close, walking around and stretching. Entering the trees, he looked at his watch and was surprised to see that it was already noon. They had just ridden 4 hours and he didn't even realize it. He picked out a tree, and did his thing, then returned to the roadside.  
他正驾车行驶，忽然感到自然的召唤，于是打起转向灯，将车靠边停下。明日香停在他的摩托车前方，也熄了火，但她并未走远，而是在附近踱步伸展。他走进树林，看了看手表，惊讶地发现已是正午时分。他们刚刚骑行了四个小时，而他竟浑然不觉。他选了一棵树，解决了内急，随后返回路边。

Asuka was there crunching on some kind of trail mix she had gotten somewhere. She looked at him, and held the bag out silently. She followed his hand with her eyes as he pulled some out, but she never said a word. Shinji wondered if this was the silent treatment. If it was then it was fine with him. As he could stay quiet longer than she could.  
明日香正嚼着某种她在某处买来的什锦果仁。她看着他，默默地递出袋子。她目光随着他的手移动，看着他抓取一些，却始终一言不发。真嗣暗想，这是不是所谓的沉默对待。若是如此，他倒也无所谓。毕竟，他能比她更长时间地保持沉默。

The trail mix was OK. It consisted of peanuts, cashews, and pieces of chocolate and raisins. And odd mix, but it worked, salty and sweet, yet chewy and crunchy. It had it all. He pulled out a bottle of water, and threw it to Asuka, then got one for himself. He had started getting a bit of a headache a while back so he knew that he had to start drink more water. At least they would not have to worry much about water for a while. It did not go bad the same way juices and other things did. He supposed if you left it in the bottle long enough it would taste weird.  
那混合坚果还不错。里面有花生、腰果、巧克力和葡萄干。虽然搭配奇特，但效果却出奇地好，咸甜交织，既有嚼劲又脆口。应有尽有。他掏出一瓶水，扔给明日香，然后自己也拿了一瓶。他之前开始有点头疼，所以知道得多喝水。至少他们暂时不用担心水的问题。水不像果汁和其他东西那样会变质。他想，如果瓶子里的水放得太久，味道可能会变得怪怪的。

Asuka interrupted his thoughts as she cleared her throat, and remounting her motorcycle. He had to admit she really looked good on that bike. She looked good off of it too, but unless things changed, he would never tell her that. First she would probably "hentai" him to death, then agree with him and let it go to her head. He thought 'some things will never change'.  
明日香清了清嗓子，打断了他的思绪，重新跨上摩托车。他不得不承认，她骑在摩托车上真的很帅气。不骑车的时候也很迷人，但除非情况改变，否则他永远不会告诉她这一点。首先，她可能会把他当成变态对待，然后同意他的看法，让这成为她的骄傲资本。他想，'有些事情永远不会改变'。

With that last thought, Shinji got back on his bike too, donned his helmet and cranked it up. He was getting used to it by now. His butt still hurt, but he was a lot more comfortable with the bikes handling now that they had come so far. Pulling away, he looked back to Asuka as she started her own motorcycle, and followed.  
带着这最后的念头，真嗣也重新骑上了他的摩托车，戴上头盔并启动引擎。现在他已经逐渐习惯了。虽然屁股还是隐隐作痛，但经过这么长时间的骑行，他对摩托车的操控已经更加自如。他启动摩托车，回头看了一眼明日香，她也开始发动自己的摩托车，随后跟了上来。

A little ways down the road they rolled through the city of Sayo. After stopping for a minute at a gas station, Shinji pulled out the map, and consulted it. Another 25 miles away was the city of Tsuyama. From there they would turn south to Okayama, which lay perhaps another 30 miles beyond. His gas guage was getting close to 1/4 tank, so he pulled over, and turned the engine off, and prepared to hand pump some more gas. He filled both his and Asuka's tanks while she went in the restroom there to do her thing.  
沿着道路前行不久，他们穿过了佐用市。在加油站停了一会儿后，真嗣拿出地图查看。距离他们还有 25 英里的是津山市。从那里他们将转向南行至冈山市，大约还有 30 英里的路程。他的油表显示油量接近四分之一，于是他停下车，关闭引擎，准备用手泵加些油。他给两人的油箱都加满了油，而明日香则去那里的洗手间处理自己的事情。

The asphalt radiated the heat back up at him, and he was surprised at the sweltering hot day it had turned into. He had hoped that morning that they would have a mild day for once. He drank some more water, emptying the bottle this time, then broke open another. Soon with the gas pumped, Asuka relieved, they left heading for Tsuyama and Okayama beyond it. The highway was really straight here, and so allowed people to get up to some high speeds. Such must have been the case with a large car pileup they passed a few minutes later. It was spectacular. One car had flipped over, and rode about 300 feet on it roof. Two other cars had wrapped around each other, and the rest were all rolled on they're sides, roof's or were precariously balance on something all together in a pile.  
柏油路面将热气反射回他身上，他惊讶于这天竟变得如此酷热难耐。早上他还曾希望至少能有个温和的日子。他又喝了几口水，这次把瓶子喝空了，然后又打开一瓶。不久，加满油后，明日香松了口气，他们便启程前往津山，以及更远的冈山。这段高速公路异常笔直，使得车速能飙得相当高。几分钟后他们经过的一起大型连环车祸便是明证。那场面颇为壮观，一辆车翻了个底朝天，车顶滑行了约三百英尺；另有两辆车紧紧缠绕在一起；其余的则侧翻在地，或是车顶着地，又或是岌岌可危地堆叠在一起。

"Wow" Asuka said before realizing her mistake. Shinji looked over and smiled. Asuka gave him a mock "Hmmmph!" and smiled herself. He liked her this way, without that emotional wall of pride and arrogance. Their morning spat almost forgotten, he started thinking about her smile. While she smiled a lot more often now than she used to (at least to him), he enjoyed it every time she did it, like it was the very first time.  
“哇哦。”明日香脱口而出，随即意识到自己的失言。真嗣转头望来，微笑着。明日香佯装不悦地哼了一声，自己也笑了。他喜欢她这样，没有那堵骄傲与自负构成的情感高墙。早晨的小争执几乎被遗忘，他开始思考她的笑容。虽然她现在比以前笑得更多了（至少对他如此），但每次她笑，他都像第一次见到那样享受。

A few miles down the road they saw the sign to turn off on highway 53 South. Soon they were pulling into the outskirts of Okayama. It was not a small town, but neither was it a sprawling big city. Things were quiet … just like everything nowadays. The wind blew sadly through the town, and everything stood still except for some old newspaper and a fast food wrapper, and such.  
沿着公路行驶了几英里后，他们看到了转向 53 号南高速公路的标志。不久，他们驶入了冈山市的郊区。这不是一个小城镇，但也算不上是一个庞大的都市。一切都静悄悄的……就像如今的一切。风悲伤地穿过小镇，除了一些旧报纸和快餐包装袋在飘动，其他一切都静止不动。

Shinji realized that they had been so worried about getting here, now what were they going to do? "Hey Asuka. So now that we are here, what do you want to do? I don't think either of us want to stay in that tent anymore."  
真嗣意识到，他们一直担心如何到达这里，现在到了，又该做什么呢？“嘿，明日香。既然我们已经到了，你想做什么？我觉得我们俩都不想再住那个帐篷了。”

She seemed to think for a few seconds before answering. "I want a place to stay. I am tired of that apartment, I'm also tired of the tent. I wanna house. It's as good a place to start as any I think." She looked self assured and pleased with her self in a very Asuka-like fashion.  
她似乎思考了几秒钟才回答。“我想要一个住的地方。我已经厌倦了那个公寓，也厌倦了帐篷。我想要一栋房子。我觉得这是一个不错的开始。”她看起来自信满满，带着一种非常像明日香的风格，对自己感到满意。

That was true. If they were going to make it, they needed a more permanent place to stay. "OK. I think the first thing we might want to do is take a tour around the local area and find out what all there is. Why settle for second rate right?"  
这是真的。如果他们要安定下来，他们需要一个更永久的住所。“好吧。我想我们首先要做的可能是环顾一下当地，了解一下所有的情况。为什么要满足于次等的选择呢？”

Asuka smiled. "I like the way you think, Third Child. OK, lets go see if we can find a map of the area, or even a real estate office. They would have a pretty good guide to housing in the area right?"  
明日香笑了。“我喜欢你的想法，第三子。好吧，我们去看看能不能找到这个地区的地图，或者甚至是一家房地产办公室。他们应该对这个地区的住房有很好的了解，对吧？”

"Yup. I would imagine they would." They rode through the middle of town, and sure enough there were several all within sight of each other.. They entered Tsuruya Inc. and found several pamphlets illustrating houses in the area. In one there was a map showing different areas and explaining what could be found there in the way of houses and property.  
"没错，我想他们会的。" 他们穿过小镇中心，果然，几家店铺都近在咫尺。他们进入鹤屋株式会社，找到了几本介绍当地房屋的小册子。其中一本里有一张地图，展示了不同区域，并解释了各处可找到的房屋和地产情况。

The first area they went to had some nice houses and was back in the mountains. One house in particular caught their eye immediately. It sat partway up the slope, and had a large cathedral ceiling with picture windows along the sun facing side to let light in. There were three bedrooms and 2 1/2 baths.  
他们首先去的一个区域有一些不错的房子，位于山中。其中一栋房子特别吸引他们的目光。它坐落在山坡半腰，拥有高耸的教堂式天花板和面向阳光一侧的大幅落地窗，以便采光。这栋房子有三间卧室和 2.5 个浴室。

"Well that was easy. You picked out a nice house Shinji."  
"这倒挺简单的。你选了一栋好房子，真嗣。"

"Wha... you are just going to settle for the first thing we come to?" Shinji looked around. It was well furnished. The owners had good taste.  
"什...你就打算随便找个地方住下？" 真嗣环顾四周，这里家具齐全，主人品味不错。

"Why not? Why waste time looking for another one when this one is just fine? It is not like we can't afford it. Course I think we are going to have to do something about this chair. Yuck." Undoubtedly someone had been sitting in the chair when they dissolved. There was a large stain all over the seat and clothes were rumpled on the seat where they had sat.  
"为什么不呢？既然这里已经很好了，何必浪费时间找别的？我们又不是付不起。不过这椅子得处理一下，真恶心。" 显然，有人在这张椅子上溶解了，座位上有一大片污渍，衣服也皱巴巴地堆在上面。

"Well if this is really where you want to live, that is OK with me. I don't really care one way or the other. Now I think I ought to go find my place."  
"好吧，如果你真想住这儿，我没意见。我其实无所谓。现在我想我该去找我的住处了。"

"What?! What do you mean? You're not going to live here?" Asuka was alarmed to see Shinji leaving.  
"什么？！你这是什么意思？你不打算住在这里了？" 看到真嗣要离开，明日香感到惊慌。

"Well I didn't think that you wanted me hanging around all the time. We didn't get along that well when we were living with ... Misato." Shinji was sorry he had even thought of Misato. He missed her. He missed everyone. But of everyone who was gone, he missed his guardian the most, even with her quirks. She was kind to him, and seemed to genuinely care for him. He really missed her!  
"嗯，我以为你不想我一直在你身边晃悠。我们和...美里住在一起时相处得并不太好。" 真嗣后悔自己竟然想到了美里。他想念她，想念所有人。但在所有离开的人中，他最想念的是他的监护人，尽管她有些古怪。她对他很友善，似乎真的关心他。他真的很想念她！

Asuka closed the door so Shinji couldn't get out. "Shinji, I don't think I would do too well being alone most of the time. Without at least someone around I … get depressed, and you probably don't want to know what I might do or think about when I am depressed like that. I just want someone close by." She looked sternly at him, then smiled. "Even if it's only you." If he wouldn't stay after her asking she would get mad again. No begging from Asuka Langley Souryu.  
明日香关上门，不让真嗣出去。"真嗣，我不认为我大部分时间独自一人会过得很好。没有至少一个人在身边，我...会变得抑郁，你可能不想知道我在那种抑郁状态下会做什么或想什么。我只是希望有人在我附近。" 她严肃地看着他，然后笑了笑。"即使那个人只是你。" 如果他听了她的话还不留下，她会再次生气。明日香·兰格雷·惣流是不会乞求的。

Shinji looked down at his shoes and nodded his head. "OK, Asuka. I didn't know you felt that way." A small smile appeared on Shinji's face.  
真嗣低头看着自己的鞋子，点了点头。“好的，明日香。我不知道你这么想。”一丝微笑浮现在真嗣的脸上。

"Besides, who is going to change my bandages and clean up after me?" She smiled again.  
“再说了，谁来给我换绷带，照顾我呢？”她又笑了。

"Hey now! There are some things we may need to go over first." Shinji hoped that he knew what he was doing. Of course living with Asuka sounded like something that it was not. How things can change so quickly.  
“嘿，现在！有些事情我们可能需要先讨论一下。”真嗣希望自己知道自己在做什么。当然，和明日香一起生活听起来并不简单。事情变化得如此之快。

Later that evening, they watched the sun setting from the porch. It's golden surface looked almost amorphous as it dipped below the horizon, waving slightly from waves of heat distorting it. When the last rays were disappearing, they went back inside. Shinji went out back for a moment. They had located a small gas generator outside that had been run into the main house circuit. It started right up, and the lights inside immediately came to life.  
那天傍晚，他们坐在门廊上观赏日落。太阳的金色表面在沉入地平线时显得近乎无形，热浪的波动使其微微摇曳。当最后一缕阳光消失时，他们回到了屋内。真嗣出去了一会儿。他们在屋外找到了一个小型燃气发电机，已经接入主屋电路。发电机立刻启动，屋内的灯光随即亮起。

They had stored the motorcycles in the garage, and took the sleeping bags inside. Asuka had laid them out in two separate rooms. She valued her privacy, and she was glad to have it back at least for the night.  
他们将摩托车存放在车库里，并把睡袋搬进屋内。明日香将它们铺在两个不同的房间里。她珍视自己的隐私，很高兴至少今晚能重新拥有它。

There was some food in the kitchen, some of it good, some not so good. Shinji fixed some vegetable stir fry without the meat that night. There was also rice and dried fish. It was the first really good meal they had since leaving Tokyo-3. Hopefully once they got up and running they could have a garden or something. Maybe even raise animals for slaughter or catch fish. They talked while they ate, exploring some possibilities. The future looked bright. But it would take some work. Shinji hoped that Asuka would not revert to her old lazy self. Neither had ever thought of the possibility that they would have to get back to basics this way. Shinji a gardener? Asuka effectively a homemaker? Who would've thought it?  
厨房里有些食物，有的不错，有的不怎么样。那天晚上，真嗣做了些没有肉的蔬菜炒菜。还有米饭和干鱼。这是他们离开第三新东京市后真正好吃的一顿饭。希望一旦他们开始运作，就能有个花园什么的。甚至可能养些动物来宰杀或捕鱼。他们边吃边聊，探讨一些可能性。未来看起来很光明。但这需要一些努力。真嗣希望明日香不会回到她以前懒惰的状态。两人都从未想过他们会以这种方式回归基本生活。真嗣成为园丁？明日香实际上成了家庭主妇？谁会想到呢？

After eating so much, they both felt tired. Shinji picked up the plates, while Asuka cleaned the counters and put things away. Shinji went outside and turned off the generator. It would not do to run themselves out of fuel. Soon they said goodnight to each other, and went to their respective rooms. Shinji had just sat down and taken his shirt off when a soft knock came at his door.  
吃饱后，他们都感到疲倦。真嗣收拾了盘子，而明日香清理了台面并把东西收好。真嗣走到外面关掉了发电机。耗尽燃料可不行。不久，他们互道晚安，各自回房。真嗣刚坐下脱掉衬衫，就听到轻轻的敲门声。

"Come on in, Asuka." “进来吧，明日香。”

The door opened, and in the darkness he could make our her outline. "Shinji, I just wanted to tell you that it means a lot to me that you would stay with me. I ... I know that I'm not a very nice person to live with, and that you would want to be with me like this ..." She trailed off, and it was not until she sniffled that he realized she was crying.  
门开了，在黑暗中他能辨认出她的轮廓。“真嗣，我只是想告诉你，你愿意留下来陪我，这对我来说意义重大。我……我知道我不是个很好相处的人，而你愿意这样陪着我……”她话音渐弱，直到她抽泣起来，他才意识到她在哭泣。

"No, no… Asuka. Don't… don't cry. It's OK. You're not a bad person. We just don't understand each other sometimes. I don't even understand myself a lot of the time." He drew on Kaji's simple, but true, philosophy to help placate the girl. "Have you been worried that I thought you were a bad person, Asuka?" He then got up and guided her to sit on the bed and sat next to her.  
“不，不……明日香。别……别哭。没事的。你不是个坏人。我们只是有时候彼此不了解。很多时候我甚至不了解自己。”他借鉴了加持那简单却真实的哲学来安抚女孩。“你一直担心我认为你是个坏人吗，明日香？”随后他起身，引导她坐在床上，自己则坐在她旁边。

She nodded and leaned her head on his shoulder. Shinji hesitantly wrapped his arms around her shoulders, rocking slowly back and forth.  
她点点头，将头靠在他的肩膀上。真嗣犹豫地用双臂环抱住她的肩膀，轻轻地前后摇晃着。

Asuka had realized that her propensity for driving people away from her would be her undoing if she wasn't careful. If she drove Shinji away from her, she would be all alone, and there was no way that she could function even at the most basic levels with absolutely no one around. She rested on Shinji who was trying to figure out what to say to make things better.  
明日香意识到，如果她不谨慎，她那驱赶他人的倾向将会成为她的致命伤。如果她把真嗣也赶走了，她将孤身一人，而没有人在身边，她根本无法在最低程度上正常运作。她靠在真嗣身上，真嗣正努力思考该说些什么来改善局面。

"Shhhh." Shinji could not think of anything uplifting to say , so he just started talking about all of the things that they could do. There was no limit to the possibilities. He talked for a while, and Asuka was quiet for a long, long time. Looking down, he found that she had fallen asleep.  
“嘘……”真嗣想不出什么振奋人心的话，于是他开始谈论他们可以做的所有事情。可能性是无穷的。他讲了一会儿，明日香则沉默了很久很久。他低头一看，发现她已经睡着了。

Shinji almost laughed out loud. If she looked good riding a motorcycle, she was beautiful almost angelic when she was at peace and asleep. Laying her softly back on the sleeping bag, he stopped for a moment to watch her sleep, then picked up his shirt, and went to her designated room.  
真嗣差点笑出声来。如果她骑摩托车时看起来很酷，那么她在平静地睡着时，简直美丽得如同天使。他轻轻地将她放回睡袋里，停了一会儿，凝视着她入睡，然后拿起自己的衬衫，走向她指定的房间。

After he got in her sleeping bag, he realized that it smelled like her. He wondered why Asuka thought so little of herself in private but thought so much of herself to the public. Shinji was under the suspicion that he was one of the few people who knew that she felt this way. That made him feel good. It meant that she trusted him. And he had to make sure that that trust was well placed. He fell asleep soon with his nostrils filled with the smell of Auska's natural fragrance, and then she invaded his dreams too. Of course he had strange dreams. And they really didn't make much sense, but he was glad she was there.  
钻进她的睡袋后，他意识到那气味属于她。他不解为何明日香私下里如此轻视自己，却在公众面前自视甚高。真嗣怀疑自己是少数知道她这种感受的人之一。这让他感到欣慰，意味着她信任他。他必须确保这份信任是值得的。带着鼻尖萦绕的明日香的自然香气，他很快入睡，而她随后也闯入了他的梦境。当然，他的梦很奇怪，且没什么逻辑，但他很高兴她在那里。

Just some info for those non-Tenchi fans (Is there such a thing?) Okayama is where most of the action in the Tenchi series takes place. Not really in Okayama but nearby.  
对于非《天地无用》系列的粉丝来说（真有这样的存在吗？），冈山是该系列大部分剧情发生的地方。并非真的在冈山，而是在附近。

I know that I have not had Shinji changing out Asuka's bandages. I thought that it would get terribly repetitive to put down their every move. Unfortunately there are not too many literary works of post-apocalyptic Earth where infrastructure has survived as well. This is almost like someone detonated a huge neutron bomb. So don't be surprised if I come up with weird ideas. It is hard to imagine what you would do in situations like these, since there is no basis for comparison. No experience that I have ever had is anything like this, so this is a bit of an exploration for myself as well as my explorations of the characters. Which, by the way, is one of the big reasons why I write. It gives me a chance to delve into the psyche of the characters and try to figure them out. The best way I know how. Anyhow let me stop rambling and let you get on with your reading... Catch you in the next chapter.  
我知道自己尚未描写过真嗣为明日香更换绷带的情节，我担心那样会显得过于重复，记录他们的每一个动作。遗憾的是，关于后末日地球上基础设施保存完好的文学作品并不多。这里几乎像是有人引爆了一颗巨大的中子炸弹。所以，如果我提出一些奇怪的想法，请不要惊讶。很难想象在这样的情境下你会怎么做，因为没有可比的基础。我从未有过的经历与此相似，因此这也是对我自己的一种探索，同时也是对角色们的探索。顺便说一句，这也是我写作的一大原因。它让我有机会深入角色的内心，试图理解他们，这是我所知最好的方式。无论如何，让我停止唠叨，让你继续阅读吧……下一章见。

### Chapter 5 Day27

In the three weeks that they had enjoyed at the house, Shinji had mourned the loss of his friends, what family he had, and the countless other peoples of the Earth. In the beginning he had been kept busy figuring out how to live again, too busy to think much about it. But now, he had time to contemplate and digest the idea that no one was ever coming back.  
在他们在房子里度过的三周里，真嗣哀悼了他朋友的逝去，他所剩无几的家人，以及地球上无数其他的人们。起初，他忙于重新学会生活，无暇过多思考。但现在，他有时间去沉思和消化这个事实——再也不会有人回来了。

For several days he had broken down, unable to truly fathom the scope of it. Billions dead. None of them would ever breath again. They would never eat, love, sleep again. After realizing this he was forced to blame himself. He could have done something to bring them back. He could have found some way. Selfishly he had thought only of his own desires, and what he thought to be the way that things should be. He imagined that the spirits of those dead would want him to join them for their untimely demise. He came close to breaking down totally; he over analyzed things, and allowed the situation to get the better of him.  
有好几天，他崩溃了，无法真正理解这一切的规模。数十亿人死亡。他们再也不会呼吸，再也不会进食、相爱、睡眠。意识到这一点后，他被迫自责。他本可以做些什么来让他们复活。他本可以找到某种方法。自私地，他只考虑了自己的欲望，以及他认为事情应有的方式。他想象那些死者的灵魂会希望他加入他们，为这不合时宜的消逝。他几乎彻底崩溃；他过度分析一切，让情况控制了自己。

Asuka had somewhat of an easier time of it. She allowed herself to cry once while outside of Shinji's sight and earshot. But other than that, she stoically accepted the life that had been left for her. She did her best to comfort Shinji. She had never comforted anyone before, and did not know how best to proceed, so she had to play it by ear. She found that the things that worked best was soft reassurances like "It's gonna be OK" and "Calm down, everything is alright." Also exonerations like "It was not your fault" and "there was nothing you could have done" helped. But in the end, she was forced to be close to him. Giving him a shoulder to shed his tears on allowed him to be rid of some of the grief.  
对于明日香来说，情况稍微轻松一些。她允许自己在碇真嗣看不见也听不到的地方哭了一次。除此之外，她坚忍地接受了留给她的生活。她尽力安慰真嗣。她从未安慰过任何人，也不知道如何做得最好，所以只能随机应变。她发现最有效的是温柔的安慰，比如“一切都会好起来的”和“冷静下来，一切都好”。还有像“这不是你的错”和“你无能为力”这样的开脱也很有帮助。但最终，她不得不靠近他。给他一个肩膀哭泣，让他减轻一些悲伤。

Finally he accepted his circumstances, and allowed the healing process to begin. For Asuka it was hard to watch. Here was a boy who had a very low self-esteem to begin with, and he feels that he is responsible for the demise of nearly the entire human race that he had tried to protect on many occasions.  
最终，他接受了现实，并允许愈合过程开始。对明日香来说，这很难看下去。这是一个原本自尊心就很低的男孩，他觉得自己对几乎整个人类的灭亡负有责任，而他在许多场合都试图保护他们。

And then one day, he woke up, and actually believed it. The sun shone brighter, the woods were more beautiful, and life was worth living again. He had doubted that last fact many times over the last few days. He was still very hurt over Third Impact, but he knew that he was alive, and that he was there for some purpose. And with purpose comes meaning.  
然后有一天，他醒来，真的相信了这一切。阳光更加灿烂，森林更加美丽，生活再次值得去活。最近几天，他多次怀疑过这一点。尽管他对第三次冲击仍感到深深的伤痛，但他知道自己还活着，并且有某种存在的目的。而有了目的，就有了意义。

Meaning. What was the meaning? What was that weight? The one on his chest? He looked down, and saw a tangled mass of red. What was the meaning of **that**?! He moved very carefully out of the sleeping bag in which he was cocooned. Asuka's head stayed planted in the same spot. Slowly he reached back in and supporting her head with his hands and laid it on the ground, then slipped his legs fully out of the sleeping bag, and beat feet out of the room. He did not want to be there when she woke up. He had never been good with compromising positions, and for all intents and purposes, that was one.  
意义。那意义是什么？那压在胸口的重量又是什么？他低头一看，只见一团纠结的红色。那意义何在？！他小心翼翼地从裹着的睡袋中挪出。明日香的头部依旧固定在原位。他慢慢地伸手回去，用双手托住她的头，轻轻放在地上，然后完全抽出双腿，迅速离开房间。他不想在她醒来时还在那里。他向来不擅长处理妥协的境地，而那正是一个。

It was fairly early in the morning so he set about making breakfast while Asuka woke up. The smells issuing from the kitchen flowed down the hallway and seeping into the bedroom were just enough to start pulling Asuka's mind back to reality.  
清晨时分尚早，他便开始准备早餐，而明日香还在熟睡。厨房飘出的香气沿着走廊渗入卧室，恰好足以将明日香的意识拉回现实。

As the more sharp salty smells made their way to her nose, she opened her eyes, surprised but thankful to see that Shinji was not here. She would hate to explain to him what had happened, and she could now just pass it off like it had not happened.  
随着更为刺鼻的咸味传入鼻腔，她睁开了眼睛，惊讶但庆幸地发现真嗣不在这里。她可不想向他解释发生了什么，现在她可以轻松地当作什么都没发生过。

Rising, she made her way to the bathroom down the hall and checked herself in the mirror. Her hair was in bad shape, her face had creases in it where she had pressed against the material on the sleeping bag, and to top it all off, her face was starting to break out a little with acne. This last fact depressed her. She hated being a teenager. She wished that she could just skip to being an adult.  
她起身走向走廊尽头的浴室，对着镜子打量自己。头发一团糟，脸上因压在睡袋的布料上而留下了皱痕，更糟糕的是，她的脸开始冒出几颗青春痘。这最后一点让她感到沮丧。她讨厌青春期。她希望能直接跳过成为成年人。

She heard Shinji humming in the kitchen, and hoped that this marked an improvement to his overall mood. She hated watching him destroy himself. But then, when people have hit bottom, that is a good place to start building themselves again. Only…some people decide not to build. They decide to wallow in their depression, and not come back out. She realized that she was thinking of the way she had been only a couple of months before. Prone to thoughts of suicide.  
她听到真嗣在厨房里哼着歌，希望这标志着他情绪有所好转。她讨厌看到他自我毁灭。但话说回来，当人们跌到谷底时，正是重新开始建设自己的好时机。只是……有些人决定不再建设。他们选择沉溺于抑郁之中，不再走出来。她意识到自己只是在回想几个月前的状态，那时她常有自杀的念头。

At the time she had thought that no one knew her or wanted her enough to be able to help her, but now she knew that Shinji would have. He would have helped her through her time if she had let him in. Just as he had let her in. The last three weeks had lasted forever for her. Long days and endless nights of allowing the boy to weep for his apparent failures and trying to build him back up and show him that he was not faulted. She had been close to throwing up her hands at times. She had been close to hugging him some times too.  
那时她以为没有人了解她，也没有人足够想要她来帮助她，但现在她知道，如果她允许，真嗣会愿意的。如果她让他进入她的世界，他会陪她度过那段时光，就像他让她进入他的世界一样。过去的三个星期对她来说仿佛永恒，漫长的一天和无尽的夜晚，她听着男孩为他的明显失败而哭泣，努力重建他的信心，向他展示他并没有错。有时她几乎想放弃，有时她也几乎想拥抱他。

The smell of breakfast came even stronger from the kitchen, and she was compelled to investigate. Shinji stood at the counter cutting at some vegetables at the cutting board countertop. The quick sure repetitive "schnikt schnikt schnikt" sound was music to her ears, and she imagined what tasty meal he had been preparing.  
厨房里早餐的香味更加浓烈，她忍不住想要一探究竟。真嗣站在台面前，正在切菜板上切着蔬菜。那快速而确切的“咔嚓咔嚓咔嚓”声在她耳中宛如音乐，她想象着他正在准备的美味佳肴。

She did not really feel like facing him yet, so she went back and started cleaning the bedrooms, putting things away, and folding the futons they had procured up and putting them away. The house was a real find. It was totally customized to the person that had owned it. You would likely never see such a house again. They had been staying on the first floor, but there was a second floor that was a large loft. This opened up to look over the living and dining room of the first floor like a balcony and allowed for the cathedral ceiling. The house was designed to trap heat during the day and hold it throughout the night. But it breathed during the summer to allow the heat out more easily in the daytime.  
她其实并不太想面对他，于是转身开始打扫卧室，收拾东西，把他们弄来的被褥叠好收起。这房子真是个难得的发现，完全按照原主人的喜好定制，恐怕再难见到这样的居所。他们一直住在底楼，而二楼是个宽敞的阁楼，从那里可以俯瞰一楼的客厅和餐厅，仿佛一个阳台，还配有高耸的教堂式天花板。这房子设计得能在白天吸收热量，并在夜间保持温暖，但在夏天又能透气，让白天的热气更容易散出去。

There were two bedrooms on the first floor as well as one and a half bathrooms. On the second floor there was another bedroom in the loft as well as another bathroom, some storage and a workroom.  
底楼有两间卧室和一间半的浴室。二楼阁楼里还有一间卧室、另一间浴室、一些储物空间和一个工作间。

The kitchen was something out of Shinji's dreams. Nearly a quarter of the countertops were made from hardwood cutting board. There was an island in the middle with a large gas range-top and grill was well as cabinet space under it and a magnetic utensil hanging apparatus above. There were all manner of food processing machines, but they were left unused in an attempt to conserve power.  
厨房宛如出自真嗣的梦境。将近四分之一的台面由硬木砧板制成。中央有一个岛台，上面装有大型燃气灶和烤架，下方是橱柜空间，上方则是一个磁性悬挂餐具的装置。各式各样的食品加工机器一应俱全，但为了节约电力，它们都闲置未用。

Asuka had just finished up tidying up the second bedroom when Shinji appeared at the door, and blushing called her for breakfast. She was surprised to see him so red. He got so embarrassed from close contact with her. The only time he had not shown so much embarrassment was when he was so depressed. She thought that he had been grateful for it.  
明日香刚整理完第二间卧室，真嗣就出现在门口，脸红着叫她吃早餐。她惊讶地看到他如此红润。他一靠近她就如此害羞。唯一一次他没有表现出这么多尴尬，是在他极度沮丧的时候。她以为他会对此心存感激。

She threw the pillow on top of the futon, and followed Shinji down the hall to the kitchen. Arrayed on the table was a good-sized breakfast. Marinated fish and vegetables, steamed rice, semi-homemade miso soup, toast.  
她把枕头扔到被褥上，跟着真嗣穿过走廊来到厨房。桌上摆着丰盛的早餐。腌鱼和蔬菜、蒸米饭、半手工味噌汤、吐司。

"I couldn't find any jelly. I know you like jelly on your toast, but there wasn't any around. I'm sorry." Shinji apologized.  
"我找不到果酱了。我知道你喜欢吃吐司时涂果酱，但家里一点都没有了。对不起。" 真嗣道歉道。

"Shinji, I want you to do something for me OK?"  
"真嗣，我想让你帮我做件事，好吗？"

Shinji nodded slowly unsure of what this would entail. "Yeah?"  
真嗣缓缓点头，不清楚这会涉及什么。"嗯？"

"Never apologize to someone for giving them a huge breakfast like this. In fact, I want you to stop apologizing for things." She looked at him, making sure to make eye-to-eye contact.  
"永远不要因为给某人准备这样丰盛的早餐而向他们道歉。事实上，我希望你停止为这些事情道歉。" 她看着他，确保目光直视。

"I just knew that you liked-"  
"我只是知道你喜欢——"

"Ahhh! If you say you're sorry I am going to be forced to hurt you,." She mock threatened. "You need to understand that if I don't have jelly on my toast, I will still live. It isn't the end of the world and it won't ruin my day. It's all right. Especially in light of the abundance of other breakfast items." She gazed hungrily at the food."  
"啊！如果你再说对不起，我可就要被迫伤害你了。" 她开玩笑地威胁道。"你需要明白，如果我的吐司上没有果酱，我依然会活得好好的。这并不是世界末日，也不会毁了我的日子。没关系。尤其是考虑到还有这么多其他早餐食物的情况下。" 她饥肠辘辘地盯着食物。"

"OK. In that case, breakfast is served." Together they made quick work of the meal, and soon, there were only little bits of it left.  
“好的，那么，早餐准备好了。”他们迅速解决了这顿饭，很快，只剩下零星的残渣。

Asuka put the dishes in the sink, and ran some water over them. The water slowed after a few seconds, and she knew it was time to let the electric pump put more water in the tank up the hill. One of the great things about living out in the boondocks: You don't have to rely on big city infrastructure for daily needs and nearly everything can be done yourself. Out here you did not have to know anything about citywide water grid or power grid. You just turn the generator on, walk up the hill, let the water pump work it's magic for a few hours, and then shut it all off.  
明日香把盘子放进水槽，打开水龙头冲洗。几秒钟后，水流变缓，她知道是时候让山上的电动泵给水箱加水了。住在乡下的好处之一就是：你不必依赖大城市的基础设施来满足日常需求，几乎所有事情都可以自己动手。在这里，你不需要了解城市的水网或电网。只需启动发电机，走上山坡，让水泵运转几个小时，然后关闭一切。

But first, she was going to go for a bath. And there was the most perfect place nearby. Obviously someone had known of the spot. They had poured a couple of concrete steps just below the surface of the water so that you could sit on them and bathe. When they had found the house, initially they had not known of the bathing spot or the hotspring associated with it. Asuka had been walking near the edge of the lake one day when she had seen the water churning slightly with the heat currents rising through the colder water.  
但首先，她打算去洗个澡。附近有个绝佳的地方。显然有人知道这个地方。他们在水面下浇筑了几级混凝土台阶，这样你就可以坐在上面洗澡了。当他们最初找到这栋房子时，并不知道这个洗澡的地方和与之相关的热泉。有一天，明日香在湖边散步时，看到水因热流穿过冷水而微微翻腾。

Asuka went to her room and put her sponge, soap and other stuff in a backpack, and headed out of the house. Passing Shinji in the kitchen putting things away, she called back to him, "Shinji, I am going for a walk, I will be back in a while. OK?"  
明日香回到房间，把海绵、肥皂和其他东西放进背包，然后走出了房子。经过厨房里正在收拾东西的 Shinji，她回头喊道：“Shinji，我要去散步，一会儿就回来。好吗？”

"OK, Asuka. I'll be around."  
“好的，明日香。我会在附近。”

It was a little over a quarter mile to the spot. It was blinded from the house by a hill that rose up between the two. The walk was nice. The trees were waving their leaves in the wind, and the sounds were very pleasant. She left her clothes and the backpack on the shore and waded out to the hot spring perch. She had been here several times since they arrived, but had yet to tell Shinji about it. He bathed a ways away. She only knew this because she had watched him during the last few weeks, not due really to any interest, but out of concern for his safety. Yeah, that was it.  
距离那个地点大约四分之一英里。一座小山丘挡在房子和那里之间，使得视线受阻。步行很惬意，树木在风中摇曳着叶片，四周的声音悦耳动听。她把衣服和背包留在岸边，涉水走向温泉的栖息处。自从他们到达这里，她已经来过几次，但还没告诉过真嗣。他在稍远的地方洗澡。她之所以知道，是因为过去几周里她一直在观察他，并非出于真正的兴趣，而是出于对他安全的关心。没错，就是这样。

The warm water was soothing, and it enveloped her, allowing her muscles to relax. She shivered from the pleasant feelings, and sank further into the water, leaving just her head to stay above the surface.  
温暖的水让人感到舒缓，它包裹着她，让她的肌肉得以放松。她因这愉悦的感觉而微微颤抖，更深地沉入水中，只留下头部露出水面。

Shinji had finished cleaning the kitchen and had moved to the garage to look around in there. There were lots of boxes with odds and ends in them, but in one he found a large hammock. The threads were thick and when he spread it out, it was huge. You could probably fit 6 or 7 people in it; it was so wide. It was sturdily constructed with a large stainless steel ring at each end and heavy-duty synthetic rope to fasten it to trees or poles.  
真嗣已经打扫完厨房，移步到车库四处查看。那里有许多装着零碎物品的箱子，但在其中一个箱子里，他发现了一张巨大的吊床。吊床的线很粗，当他展开时，它非常宽大。大概能容纳 6 到 7 个人；宽度惊人。它结实耐用，两端各有一个大不锈钢环，并用耐用的合成绳索固定在树或杆子上。

He had never really relaxed in a hammock before, so he was anxious to try it out. The woods near the house provided many trees that he could tie to, but only a few would be of sufficient distance apart, and even fewer would have no other stuff around to afford him some space. He busied himself for the next 30 minutes finding such a pair of trees when he crested a hill and saw something.  
他以前从未真正在吊床上放松过，所以迫不及待想试试。房子附近的树林里有许多可以绑吊床的树，但只有少数几棵之间的距离足够，而且更少有周围没有其他东西能给他一些空间。接下来的 30 分钟里，他忙着寻找这样一对树，直到他登上一个小山丘，看到了什么。

It was Asuka. She was sitting halfway out of the water, soaping herself with a sponge, and rubbing all over… Shinji tried to avert his eyes. He succeeded for a moment or two, but inexorably he was drawn back to the sight of his housemate washing herself. After a minute or two more, he stood, and moved away, putting some distance between himself and the bathing beauty. Little did he know that standing up like that had drawn the beauty's attention to him.  
那是明日香。她半身坐在水外，用海绵给自己打上肥皂，全身揉搓着……真嗣试图移开视线。他成功了一会儿，但不可避免地，他又被吸引回看她洗澡的景象。再过了一两分钟，他站起身，走开了，与沐浴中的美人保持了些距离。他不知道，这样站起来已经引起了美人的注意。

It was another half hour before he saw her stalking up the lawn towards the house, carrying her backpack in her hand, a scowl marking her face. She walked into the house, and marched right up to Shinji.  
又过了半小时，他才看到她带着背包，面带怒容，沿着草坪向房子走来。她走进屋子，径直走到真嗣面前。

"Shinji! Did you go over there?" She pointed in the general direction of the hot spring.  
“真嗣！你是不是去那边了？”她指向温泉的大致方向。

"Y-yes. I was looking for a-" Shinji looked down at the floor.  
"是的。我在找一——" 真嗣低头看着地板。

"Did you see anything?" The scowl deepened, and her brow furrowed dangerously.  
"你看到什么了吗？" 她的眉头皱得更深，眉宇间流露出危险的气息。

"I didn't mean to. I mean, I was just- and then I saw you… And then"  
"我不是故意的。我是说，我只是——然后我看到了你……然后"

"And what, Shinji? You get your kicks watching girls bathe?"  
"那又怎样，真嗣？你是不是就喜欢看女孩子洗澡？"

"But I didn't know you were going to be there. I thought you were going out for a walk or something."  
"但我不知道你会在那里。我以为你会出去散步什么的。"

Asuka rolled her eyes. "Yeah? Well how much did you see? Hmm?"  
明日香翻了个白眼。"是吗？那你到底看到了多少？嗯？"

"Eh.. Well you know… I saw you sitting there, and" Shinji blushed a red that threatened to bleed onto the chair he was sitting on. "And you… soap and… You were beautiful Asuka. I am sorry."  
“呃...你知道的…我看到你坐在那里，然后” 真嗣的脸红得仿佛要滴到他坐的椅子上。“然后你…肥皂和…你很美，明日香。对不起。”

Asuka watched him for a moment. The bluster gone from her confrontation, she almost felt sorry for jumping at him like that. It must have taken some courage for him to say that. And of course he wouldn't lie to her. She had never known Shinji to lie about something. It killed her to think that he saw her as something so beautiful.  
明日香注视了他一会儿。她的咄咄逼人已经消失，她几乎为自己那样冲他发火感到抱歉。说出那番话对他来说一定需要勇气。当然，他不会对她撒谎。她从未见过真嗣在事情上撒谎。想到他把她看作如此美丽，她感到心痛。

She left him there without another word. Let him figure out what had happened. He would probably come and apologize in a few minutes. She threw her old clothes in the hamper and hung her towel out to dry, and sure enough Shinji appeared at her door a moment later. But standing there was not the sulking, sorry Shinji she had expected.  
她没再说一句话就离开了。让他自己去想明白发生了什么。他可能几分钟后会来道歉。她把旧衣服扔进篮子里，挂起毛巾晾干，果然，真嗣不久就出现在她门口。但站在那里的不是她预想中那个沮丧、抱歉的真嗣。

He stood straight, look her in the eye, and spoke evenly and with conviction. This was something that he had been meaning to say, he may even have rehearsed it some, and when he said it she had better listen.  
他站得笔直，目光直视她的眼睛，语气平稳而坚定。这番话他早已想好，或许还私下练习过，因此当他说出口时，她最好认真聆听。

"Asuka, you know what? You're a mystery to me. You're beautiful, in personality and physical body. But you have an ugly side to both. You demean me and ridicule me, and think of me as an inferior. And yet you show me a softer side sometimes. Allowing me to cry on you, showing me that things aren't so bad. You are very beautiful, but when you have set your mind to being mean, your face is scary and unpleasant. You should know that I am grateful for your company. But if you are going to continue this way, I am not going to want to continue with you. If there were other people left here, I would say that you will never find someone who will want to be with you if you do not start accepting people for what they are. You would be alone, even among others. That is all." And with that he turned and walked back outside, resolving to get to the wood line before stopping and breathing a relaxing sigh. He sat on the ground, and wondered why he felt so good to say something like that. It was callous, but maybe that is what it took to get the girl to change. He hated saying things like that, but he was tired of being the butt of her jokes and bearing the brunt of her anger.  
"明日香，你知道吗？你对我来说是个谜。你的内在和外表都很美，但这两方面又都有丑陋的一面。你贬低我、嘲笑我，把我视为低人一等。然而有时你又会展现出温柔的一面，让我能在你怀里哭泣，让我觉得事情并没有那么糟糕。你非常美丽，但当你决心刻薄时，你的面容变得可怕而不悦。你应该知道，我感激有你的陪伴。但如果继续这样下去，我不想再与你继续。如果有其他人在此，我会说，如果你不开始接纳人们的本真，你永远找不到愿意与你相伴的人。即使在人群中，你也会孤独。仅此而已。" 说完这些，他转身走回户外，决心走到树林边缘再停下，深呼吸放松。他坐在地上，疑惑为何说出那样的话会感到如此畅快。虽然冷酷，但或许这就是让女孩改变的必要之举。他讨厌说那样的话，但他厌倦了成为她笑话的靶子和承受她的怒火。

Asuka watched him leave the house, quietly accepting the things he had told her. It hurt, but she realized it was true. She showed herself in two different lights. In a way she was glad that this had happened. At least it had gotten Shinji to assert himself more. She had certainly not expected him to confront her about her actions. It was too bad that she had to instigate something to bring that out of him. She watched him sitting in the trees for a while. He was twisting the cords of the hammock in his hands back and forth, wringing them like he would a washcloth.  
明日香看着他离开房子，默默接受了他的话。虽然心痛，但她意识到这是真的。她以两种截然不同的方式展现自己。某种程度上，她很高兴发生了这一切。至少这让真嗣更加坚定了自己的立场。她确实没料到他会来质问她的行为。可惜的是，她不得不挑起事端才能激发出他的这一面。她注视着他坐在树丛中，手中来回扭动着吊床的绳索，就像拧干一条毛巾一样。

The thought occurred that she should apologize for blowing things out of proportion. He had not been there watching her with negative intentions. He had stumbled upon her, and was curious, but he walked away. To tell the truth that was chivalrous. He could have been perverted and stayed to watch, and she might never have known.  
她突然想到应该为夸大事态道歉。他并非带着恶意在一旁窥视她。他只是偶然撞见，出于好奇，但最终还是离开了。说实话，这算是绅士之举。他本可以变得猥琐，留下来偷看，而她可能永远不会察觉。

The house was quiet and clean so she went outside to try and talk to Shinji. He had lain back on the ground now, and was watching the clouds pass by. As she approached, he lifted his head, the look of contentment turning to caution. But he resumed watching the clouds when she lay down beside him, hands behind head.  
房子里静悄悄的，也很干净，于是她走到外面想和真嗣谈谈。他现在已经躺在了地上，正望着云朵飘过。当她走近时，他抬起头，脸上的满足变成了谨慎。但当她在他身边躺下，双手枕在头下时，他又继续看云了。

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

"Mmm?" “嗯？”

"I want to say that I'm sorry, OK? I thought that you had watched me, and that you were being perverted. I didn't think things through and I jumped to conclusions. I had no real right to be angry with you. I am trying to change. I want us to get along, but it isn't easy for me."  
“我想说对不起，好吗？我以为你偷看了我，觉得你很变态。我没有仔细考虑就妄下结论。我没有真正的理由对你生气。我正在努力改变。我希望我们能和睦相处，但这对我来说并不容易。”

Shinji looked over at her without raising his head. She took a deep breath, and let it out, eyes turned upwards. She looked over at him then, and he was surprised by the look of genuine regret in her eyes. Something that went beyond even just wishing that she could stay around him for companionship. She wanted to like him; she just had a hard time expressing that want.  
真嗣没有抬头，只是斜眼看了看她。她深吸了一口气，然后缓缓呼出，目光转向上方。随后她看向他，他惊讶于她眼中真切的悔意。那不仅仅是希望自己能留在他身边陪伴的愿望。她想要喜欢他；只是她很难表达出这种愿望。

"It's alright Asuka. I didn't mean to peek. I did watch you, just a little bit." As long as they were being honest with each other….  
“没事的，明日香。我不是故意偷看的。我只是看了你一小会儿。”只要他们彼此坦诚……

Asuka's anger swelled up again, but she doused it. The time had come and gone for that. In it's place a curiosity sprang up instead. What did he think about her?  
明日香的怒火再次涌起，但她压了下去。那个时刻已经过去。取而代之的是一种好奇心。他对她有什么看法呢？

"Am I… beautiful, Shinji?" She had always fostered the perception that she was happy with her looks, but sometimes she wondered if she was really considered beautiful.  
“我……美吗，真嗣？”她一直给人留下对自己外貌很满意的印象，但有时她会怀疑自己是否真的被认为美丽。

Shinji thought about that for a moment. Not too long. If he thought about it too long it could be misconstrued as thinking up a good answer. "I think you are beautiful Asuka." It could be a loaded question, so answer with a straightforward answer and see what happens.  
真嗣对此思考了一会儿，时间不长。如果他想得太久，可能会被误解为在构思一个好答案。“我觉得你很美，明日香。”这可能是个有深意的问题，所以直接回答，看看会发生什么。

Asuka nodded and watched an elephant balancing on a ball change into a rabbit taking a long leap. "I'm glad. I want you to know that I am glad you like me, Shinji. I'm sorry I hurt you." In an effort to change the subject she looked around, and noticed he was still holding the hammock. "Where did you find that?"  
明日香点点头，看着一只平衡在球上的大象变成了一只跳跃的长耳兔。“我很高兴。真嗣，我想让你知道，我很高兴你喜欢我。对不起，我伤害了你。”为了转移话题，她环顾四周，注意到他还在拿着吊床。“你从哪儿找到那个的？”

Shinji looked down at it. "It was in the garage packed in some boxes. I was looking for a place to put it when… when I saw you." He was turning red again.  
真嗣低头看着它。“它被放在车库里，装在一些箱子里。我正找地方放它时……就看到了你。”他的脸又红了。

"Can I help find a good place?" Doing something would help to relieve the tension between them.  
“我能帮忙找个合适的地方吗？”做点什么或许能缓解他们之间的紧张气氛。

"Y-yeah I guess. I had not found anywhere the particularly suited it. It is a very big one, and most of the trees are pretty close."  
“嗯……我想可以。我还没找到特别合适的地方。它非常大，而且大多数树都靠得很近。”

"You know, I think you were pretty close to a good area over there by the lake. The trees are spread out there." She got up, and grabbed his hand, hauling him up as well, and then pulled him along in the direction of the bathing spot.  
“你知道吗，我觉得你刚才在湖边那块地方挺不错的，树与树之间间隔得当。”她站起身，抓住他的手，把他一起拉起来，然后拽着他朝洗澡的地方走去。

Sure enough there were several spots that would suffice here. But one in particular gave a grand view of the lake. By the time they found the spot and strung the hammock up it was early afternoon, and the day was nearing its more intense heat, so they decided to rest in the hammock, which was situated in the shade of both trees.  
果然，这里有几个地方都挺合适。但其中一个特别的地方能一览湖景。当他们找到这个地方并挂好吊床时，已是午后时分，白昼的热度正逐渐加剧，于是他们决定在吊床上休息，吊床正好位于两棵树的树荫下。

It was even bigger than Shinji had thought it was. The cords were many different colors and when they stretched it out on both sides it made an immense rainbow like pattern several times all the way across.  
它比真嗣想象中的还要大。绳索是多种颜色交织的，当他们将其在两边展开时，形成了一道巨大的彩虹图案，横跨数次。

It was a bit of a chore to get both of them in it without spilling the other out, but after a few minutes of wobbling, they managed to settle it down, with Shinji draping his leg over one side to swing back and forth. The clouds were fast disappearing, and the heat continued, so with nothing much left to do but relax, they did exactly that.  
要把两人都塞进吊床而不让另一个掉出来，确实有点费劲，但经过几分钟的摇晃，他们终于稳住了，真嗣还把一条腿搭在一边，来回晃荡。云朵迅速消散，热度依旧，既然没什么别的事可做，他们便干脆放松下来。

Within 10 minutes both were asleep. It was a very comfortable hammock.  
不到十分钟，两人都睡着了。这吊床非常舒适。

---

Later in the afternoon, Asuka awoke. Shinji's face was stuffed between her upper arm and the cords of the hammock. For a while she just enjoyed the ability to relax. The sky was starting to turn from its normally blue state to orange. Shinji twitched a few times in his sleep.  
下午晚些时候，明日香醒了。真嗣的脸埋在她上臂和吊床绳索之间。她享受了一会儿放松的感觉。天空开始从平常的蓝色转为橙色。真嗣在睡梦中抽动了几下。

Asuka thought for a while about how good she had it. She didn't really have to worry about too much. No societal complications. No needless school related distraction. No more need to put her life on the line in a monstrous battle-form. And although she was stuck with only one person, she realized that he was a good person, and he would never consciously hurt her. His kind heart would be there for her even when she was mean to him.  
明日香沉思了一会儿，想着自己过得有多好。她其实不必担心太多。没有社会纷扰，没有无谓的学校干扰，不再需要在怪物般的战斗形态中拼命。尽管她只能和一个男人在一起，但她意识到他是个好人，绝不会故意伤害她。即使她对他刻薄，他那善良的心也会在她身边。

Shinji shifted around next to her, and she looked at him. Not really with adoration or any other emotion, she just wanted to see what he was doing. His face pressed even further into the hammock, and his mouth was open now.  
真嗣在她旁边挪动了一下，她看了看他。并非出于崇拜或其他情感，她只是想看看他在做什么。他的脸更深地埋进了吊床，嘴巴现在张开着。

"I am sorry Shinji. Thank you for sticking with me. I needed you and you were there for me. I'm glad you are here."  
“对不起，真嗣。谢谢你一直陪着我。我需要你的时候，你就在那里。我很高兴你在这里。”

Shinji closed his mouth, reached up and scratched his face. "Uh-huh. I love you too Asuka."  
真嗣闭上嘴，伸手挠了挠脸。“嗯哼，我也爱你，明日香。”

She frowned. It was no small surprise that if he was speaking his feelings for her, that they were indeed true. She pretty well knew that he had a thing for her. Of course it had never been her intention to test that theory. She had certainly not meant that she loved him. Or had she? Was she trying to tell him in uncertain terms exactly that? She sighed a heavy sigh. Why were feelings so hard to quantify? If you are the one having the feelings, why can't you just objectively analyze them and determine exactly how you feel. Frustrated she slowly exited he hammock so as not to disturb the sleeping Shinji next to her, and stretched.  
她皱起眉头。如果他真的在向她表达感情，那确实令人意外。她很清楚他对自己有好感。当然，她从未有意去验证这个理论。她当然没打算说自己爱他。或者她有吗？她是不是在用不确定的方式告诉他这一点？她重重地叹了口气。为什么感情这么难以量化？如果你是那个有感情的人，为什么不能客观地分析它们，准确地确定你的感受。她感到沮丧，慢慢地从吊床上下来，以免打扰睡在旁边的真嗣，然后伸展了一下身体。

Noting the time according to her watch, she realized that she was starting to get hungry. The breakfast from that morning was enough to carry them over with no lunch, but it was nearly 4:30 and it was time to fuel the fire again.  
看了看手表上的时间，她意识到自己开始饿了。早上的早餐足够让他们撑到没有午餐，但现在已经是下午 4:30，是时候再次补充能量了。

She was careful to shake Shinji only enough to wake him. Bleary eyed, and groggy from the afternoon nap, he raised his head, and had a hideous criss-cross pattern all over his face. "Hey sleepyhead, I think we may need to hook up something to eat. I am getting hungry."  
她小心翼翼地摇晃着真嗣，力度刚好能唤醒他。睡眼惺忪，午觉后的他脑袋昏沉，抬起头时，脸上布满了纵横交错的印痕。“嘿，小懒虫，我觉得我们可能需要弄点吃的了。我有点饿了。”

---

Back inside once again, Shinji set about finding something to eat. With no cooling capacity they could not keep a lot of things ready for dinner. Fortunately they had spotted some readymade meals at a local grocery store on a recent visit. With only water, and some heat, they had a steamy Italian dish in only 45 minutes.  
再次回到屋内，真嗣开始寻找食物。由于没有冷藏设备，他们无法储存太多晚餐食材。幸运的是，最近在一家当地杂货店发现了一些即食餐。只需水和一些加热，他们便在 45 分钟内享用到了热腾腾的意大利菜。

While they ate, they talked about trying to get some more necessities online to make things a little easier. Brainstorming between the two kept them from thinking about the days events. They had talked enough about it, and they were happy with the results, so it would not do to keep rehashing it.  
吃饭时，他们讨论着尝试在网上购买更多必需品，以使生活更轻松些。两人间的头脑风暴让他们暂时不去想当天发生的事情。关于这些已经谈得够多了，而且他们对结果感到满意，所以没必要再反复讨论。

First they needed to see about electrical supply. Neither of them had any idea about large-scale power supply. It had never been something that they felt the need to worry about or learn about.  
首先，他们需要解决电力供应问题。两人对大规模供电一无所知，这从来不是他们觉得有必要担心或学习的事情。

So they started at the top. Something that would generate enough power to run the house. Since fuel would become an issue sooner or later, the generator out back was pretty well out of the question. While the ocean was near, it had never been tapped for tidal power.  
于是他们从源头开始考虑。需要一种能足够驱动整个房子的发电方式。由于燃料迟早会成为问题，后院的柴油发电机基本不在考虑范围内。尽管靠近海洋，但从未利用过潮汐能。

But due to the winds coming off of the water, coupled with the fact that mountainous terrain was usually accompanied by higher than normal winds, there was some wind generators within a reasonable distance. The only thing was that they would supply power to the entire area, and even would attempt to spread it out over the entire power grid.  
但由于水面上吹来的风，加上山区地形通常伴随着比正常情况更强的风，附近有一些风力发电机。唯一的问题是，它们将为整个区域供电，甚至试图将电力分散到整个电网中。

They decided that a trip into town tomorrow would be needed to assess the feasibility of trying to redirect that power. For all they knew, they turbines were still providing power, but it was not reaching them because it was being used before it got that far.  
他们决定明天进城一趟，评估一下尝试重新引导那股电力的可行性。据他们所知，涡轮可能仍在发电，但电力未能到达他们这里，可能是因为在途中已被使用。

But what if they managed to get the power here, and the wind died down occasionally? The point hung in the air for a minute or two. They had eaten all of the food that was prepared, so Shinji started clearing off the table. Perhaps they should visit the library and research some other forms of power generation.  
但如果他们设法将电力引到这里，风却偶尔减弱怎么办？这个问题在空气中悬了一两分钟。他们已经吃完了准备的所有食物，于是真嗣开始收拾桌子。或许他们应该去图书馆研究一下其他形式的发电方式。

It was dark outside, and the artificial light that they enjoyed spilled out onto the porch. With no more ideas about the power generation, they turned the subject to each other. Shinji had already told Asuka quite a bit about his past, so he only took a few minutes and fill in a few gaps.  
外面天色已暗，他们享受的人工灯光洒在门廊上。关于发电的话题已无更多想法，他们转而聊起了彼此。真嗣已经向明日香透露了不少自己的过去，所以他只花了短短几分钟填补了一些空白。

Asuka started as far back as she could remember, and even allowed for things that people had told her from even further back than that. She told of her parent's devotion to their work, her mother's accident at the hands of Unit 02, and her suicide not long afterward. Asuka did her best to hold back her anguish but like a weakened dam, the walls holding it back finally buckled and the sad memories got the better of her.  
从她能记事起，甚至包括那些别人告诉她的更早以前的事情，Asuka 开始讲述。她谈到了父母对工作的执着，母亲在二号机手中的意外，以及不久后的自杀。Asuka 尽力压抑自己的痛苦，但就像一座脆弱的堤坝，阻挡它的墙壁最终崩塌，悲伤的记忆占据了上风。

What had started as a good evening, one might even say a pleasant one, had turned into an introspective and revealing experience for Asuka. Shinji was by her side, trying to soothe the sadness that had welled up in her. This was the first time he had seen her cry, and he took it as her showing him a great amount of trust that she had placed in him.  
原本是一个美好的夜晚，甚至可以说是愉快的，却变成了对 Asuka 来说一次内省和揭示的经历。Shinji 在她身边，试图抚慰她涌起的悲伤。这是他第一次看到她哭泣，他将其视为她对他展现出的极大信任。

After quite some time she continued, telling him about her stepmother, and pouring herself into her studies in school and college. How she had never really wanted to be close to anyone. She only maintained appearances to make things easier.  
经过相当长的时间，她继续讲述，谈到了她的继母，以及她在学校和大学中全身心投入学业的情况。她从未真正想要亲近任何人。她只是为了使事情变得更容易而维持表面关系。

This description of her life nearly mirrored his own. The similarities were amazing. If anything though, it was good that they were so alike. He understood her much better than he would have otherwise. She was so much like him that it was like looking at a version of himself.  
她生活的描述几乎与他如出一辙。这些相似之处令人惊叹。不过，他们如此相似也是件好事。他比其他任何情况下都更能理解她。她与他如此相像，仿佛在看另一个自己。

At length, she sighed a shaky sigh of relief. She had not told very many people about her past. And now Shinji was the only one on Earth who knew it. She calmed down slowly, breathing deeply. Then she noticed her proximity to Shinji. He was holding her from her right side, with his arms wrapped around her. She recognized this position. She had comforted him many times recently almost exactly like this.  
终于，她长长地叹了一口气，松了一口气。她并没有告诉很多人关于她的过去。现在，地球上只有真嗣一个人知道。她慢慢平静下来，深呼吸着。然后她注意到了自己与真嗣的距离。他从右边抱着她，双臂环绕着她。她认出了这个姿势。最近她多次这样安慰他，几乎一模一样。

The cool night air flowed in through the open windows and doors. Asuka shivered, and Shinji held her closer. For just this moment, no words were said. Quiet was the order of the day. To speak would be to ruin it, to degrade and erode it. To move or speak would break the spell that allowed such a moment. It lasted forever, but it ended too soon. Asuka got a cramp in her leg, and she ignored it for as long as she could, but finally she had to stretch her legs out, and relieve it.  
凉爽的夜风从敞开的门窗中吹进来。明日香打了个寒颤，真嗣将她抱得更紧。就在这一刻，没有言语。安静是今天的命令。说话会破坏这一切，贬低和侵蚀它。移动或说话会打破允许这样时刻的魔咒。它持续了很久，但又结束得太快。明日香的腿抽筋了，她尽可能地忍耐，但最终不得不伸展双腿，缓解疼痛。

And the moment was gone. The stillness of the house was overwhelming. It was a little much for the girl. She had never had to be consoled about anything in her life. No one ever held her. No one ever told her that it was going to be OK. And here this spineless little boy was keeping her afloat; in turn, she was keeping him afloat.  
那一刻就这样消逝了。屋内的寂静令人窒息。对女孩来说，这有些难以承受。她一生中从未需要过任何安慰。没有人拥抱过她。没有人告诉她一切都会好起来的。而此刻，这个懦弱的小男孩却在支撑着她；反过来，她也在支撑着他。

She stood up from the chair, allowing Shinji's arms to fall away from her. He looked up to see her walk away. Looking around the side of the chair, he could only wonder what had happened. It had felt so good to hold her like that. The chair felt empty. He heard her door close down the hall, and he heaved a sigh that would make one think he was the most tired person in the world.  
她从椅子上站起身，让真嗣的双手从她身上滑落。他抬头看着她走开。从椅子侧面望去，他只能疑惑发生了什么。那样抱着她感觉如此美好。椅子显得空荡荡的。他听到她关上了走廊尽头的门，发出一声叹息，仿佛他是世界上最疲惫的人。

He hoped that he had not hurt Asuka. He did his best never to do that. But it seemed like it happened anyway. He stood and stretched. It was time for bed, but first he went outside and turned off the generator.  
他希望自己没有伤害到明日香。他尽力避免那样做。但似乎总是事与愿违。他站起身来伸展了一下。该睡觉了，但首先他得出去关掉发电机。

The house was plunged into darkness, and so as not to upset his redheaded roommate, he stealthily moved through the shadows, easing his door open, and stepping in his room. Another sigh, and he removed his shirt and pants, and then slipped under the covers of his futon.  
房子陷入了一片黑暗，为了不惊扰他那红发的室友，他悄无声息地在阴影中移动，轻轻推开自己的房门，踏入房间。又是一声叹息，他脱下衬衫和裤子，然后滑进被褥下的蒲团。

He felt something against his skin, and felt for it. It was just the zipper along the side that let one take the stuffing out to clean. There was nothing and no one in the bed with him, so he went to sleep. But a little while later there was, when someone silently opened his door, and tried to fill the aching hole in her chest by holding him close.  
他感觉到皮肤上有东西触碰，伸手去摸。只是沿着侧面可以拆卸清洗的拉链。床上没有其他人，于是他便入睡了。但不久之后，当某人无声地推开他的房门，试图通过紧紧拥抱他来填补心中的空洞时，床上便有了人。

### Chapter 6 Day28

If you have been waiting for some relationship development, you will have to wait just a bit longer. I needed to get some things out or the way first, and set the stage a little more. I don't really expect outstanding reviews for this chapter since it is the character development and action chapters that seem to really set people off. Anyhow, I do hope that you enjoy this one.  
如果你一直在期待某些关系的发展，那么你还得再等一会儿。我需要先把一些事情处理好，再稍微铺垫一下。我并不指望这一章能获得多么出色的评价，因为似乎正是角色发展和行动章节最能引起人们的兴趣。不过，我还是希望你能喜欢这一章。

---
In his dreams, Shinji was usually alone. So he thought he was in this one too. But after a while, he became aware of another presence with him. He could not see her, but she was there. Her presence was bright and wild. He felt the slightest touch at his side. She did not speak, but then he did not need her to. She was with him. They explored this and that. Roamed all over seeing what life had to offer, and when they were done, they touched briefly and he swam up from the darkness to the waking world.  
在他的梦中，真嗣通常是独自一人。因此他认为这次也是如此。但过了一会儿，他意识到还有另一个存在与他同在。他看不见她，但她就在那里。她的存在明亮而狂野。他感觉到身旁轻微的触碰。她没有说话，但他也不需要她开口。她与他同在。他们探索着这里那里，四处游荡，体验生活所提供的一切，当他们结束时，他们短暂地触碰了一下，他从黑暗中浮起，回到了现实世界。

Sometime in the early morning Asuka awoke, and slid languidly away from Shinji, padding softly to the door, and after a brief pause and a thoughtful look back at him, she was gone, back to her bedroom to continue the night alone.  
某个清晨时分，明日香醒来，慵懒地从真嗣身边滑开，轻轻地走到门口，短暂停留并若有所思地回头看了他一眼，随后便消失，回到自己的卧室继续独自度过夜晚。

Outside the first rays of sunshine were starting to illuminate the sky. At first, it was too subtle for any human eye to pick up, but if you could perhaps see in the near IR spectrum it would be much brighter than the surrounding sky. As the sun made its endless journey through the sky, finally it broke over the horizon, and flooded the house with its might.  
外面，第一缕阳光开始照亮天空。起初，这变化细微到任何人类的眼睛都无法察觉，但如果你能看见近红外光谱，那将会比周围的天空明亮得多。随着太阳在天空中无尽的旅程，终于它跃出地平线，将房屋沐浴在它的光辉之中。

The wooden framing of the walls, and light tones throughout cast the entire house in a light golden tint. With the breaking of day, also came the resumption of the din of insect noises that accompanied the out of doors.  
木质的墙体框架和浅色调的室内装饰，让整个房子笼罩在一片金色的光晕中。随着白昼的破晓，户外也恢复了昆虫的喧嚣声。

Asuka tried valiantly to go back to sleep, but the light was insistent. So finally she got up and stayed up. She was alright. Not suffering from any lack of sleep. She wandered into the kitchen and started looking through the cabinets. Her eyes latched onto a pouch of coffee. She had never had coffee, and had smelled many different types. If they tasted at all like they smelled it would be delicious.  
明日香努力尝试再次入睡，但那光线却执拗不休。最终，她还是起床了，决定不再躺着。她感觉还好，并没有因为缺乏睡眠而感到不适。她漫步到厨房，开始翻找橱柜。目光锁定在一袋咖啡豆上。她从未喝过咖啡，却闻过许多种不同的咖啡香。如果它们的味道能与香气相符，那必定是美味的。

She walked outside and turned on the generator. Fortunately it was on the other side of the house than where Shinji was so he did not hear it. Back inside, she loaded the grounds into the coffee maker, and started fixing a breakfast as best she could. There was some instant dough mix, so she decided that they could have biscuits. It had been quite some time since she had had biscuits. And honey. Yumm. Honey was good on biscuits.  
她走到屋外，启动了发电机。幸好发电机在房子的另一侧，真嗣没有听到声音。回到屋内，她将咖啡粉倒入咖啡机，并尽可能地准备早餐。橱柜里有一些即食面团混合物，她决定可以做些饼干。已经很久没有吃过饼干了。还有蜂蜜。嗯，蜂蜜配饼干，美味极了。

All the mix required was water so she mixed it up, kneaded it, rolled it out, and began cutting small flat round bits of it out and arranging them on a cookie sheet. After a short stay in the oven, they were done, and she pulled them out to cool. There was some honey in a small honey pot complete with a honey spoon in the cupboard too.  
所有混合物只需加水，她便将其搅拌、揉捏、擀平，然后开始切出小而扁平的圆形面团，排列在烤盘上。经过烤箱短暂的烘烤，饼干完成了，她取出让其冷却。橱柜里还有一个小蜜罐，里面装有蜂蜜和配套的蜂蜜勺。

Setting this and the biscuits on the table, she went to wake Shinji up, and found him already awake and readying himself for the day. To be exact she found him naked, and dressing in clean clothes for the day. She had the discretion of only opening the door wide enough to peek, and not saying anything. Unfortunately she was too curious just to let it go, and ended up watching him for a couple of minutes. She moved back down the hall toward the kitchen, and yelled to him. "Shinji! I have breakfast ready. Rise and shine sleepy-butt!"  
她将这些和饼干放在桌上，便去叫醒真嗣，却发现他已经醒了，正准备起床。确切地说，她看到他一丝不挂，正在穿干净的衣服。她很有分寸地只把门开到足够偷看的宽度，没有出声。不幸的是，她太好奇了，无法就此罢休，结果偷偷观察了他几分钟。她回到走廊，朝厨房走去，大声喊道：“真嗣！早餐准备好了。起床啦，懒虫！”

"Yeah, yeah. I am coming, Asuka." He appeared from his door, and looked at her. The light shone through her hair. The red had never appeared so bright, so wild, so perfect for her as it had right then.  
“知道了，知道了。我来了，明日香。”他从房门走出，看着她。阳光透过她的头发。那红色从未如此耀眼，如此狂野，如此适合她，就在那一刻。

"What?" She asked looking around. "What is it?"  
“什么？”她环顾四周问道，“怎么了？”

He just smiled a little and shook his head. The smells wafting down the short hallway almost carried him to the kitchen without him taking a step. French Vanilla coffee was poured in cups, which were ready next to plates piled with a few biscuits, each of which were still steaming. His mouth watered, and he practically beamed at Asuka.  
他只是微微一笑，摇了摇头。短廊里飘来的香气几乎让他不由自主地走向厨房。法式香草咖啡已经倒进了杯子，旁边摆着堆满几块饼干的盘子，每块饼干还冒着热气。他垂涎欲滴，几乎对明日香露出了灿烂的笑容。

For someone who claimed to be a terrible cook, she made a damned fine breakfast of biscuits. Asuka noticed his look, and knew pretty well what it was. "I hope you like honey on them, that is about all there is."  
对于自称糟糕厨师的她来说，这顿早餐的饼干做得相当不错。明日香注意到他的表情，很清楚他在想什么。"我希望你喜欢在上面加蜂蜜，这是唯一有的东西。"

"Honey is fine, Asuka. Thank you very much. This looks wonderful." They both sat and dug in to their plates of biscuits.  
蜂蜜很好，明日香。非常感谢。这看起来很棒。" 他们俩都坐下来，开始享用盘中的饼干。

Asuka was the first to taste the coffee, and it was all she could do to keep from spitting it back out. "Oh my God. I must have made it wrong or the grounds were bad. Ughh."  
明日香第一个尝了咖啡，她费了好大劲才没把咖啡吐出来。“哦，天哪。我一定是做错了或者咖啡粉有问题。呃。”

Shinji took a quick sip. "Nope, that is about how it all tastes to me. Everyone I have talked to says 'It's an acquired taste.' Whatever that means."  
真嗣迅速抿了一口。“不，对我来说大概就是这个味道。我聊过的每个人都说是‘需要慢慢习惯的味道’。管它什么意思呢。”

"Well they can have it. That sucks." Asuka made another sour face, and Shinji agreed.  
“好吧，他们可以留着。这太糟糕了。”明日香又做了个苦脸，真嗣也表示同意。

The biscuits went fast, and soon all that was left was crumbs. They put the dishes in the sink, and got ready to leave. They packed a couple of lunches of cheese and crackers because there was no telling whether they would be able to get to some lunch during the day. They hurried because it would be best if they got out of the house early. It would take all day to visit the places they would need to go.  
饼干很快就没了，只剩下些碎屑。他们把盘子放进水槽，准备离开。因为不知道白天是否能找到午餐，他们打包了几份奶酪和饼干作为午餐。他们急忙出发，最好早点离开家。他们需要一整天的时间去拜访那些必须去的地方。

The ride into town was a fairly short one. They had negotiated the twisty roads outside of town often enough now that it was much faster than their first few times.  
进城的路上相当短。他们现在已经习惯了城外蜿蜒的道路，比最初几次快多了。

First order of business was to visit the library. It was a rather large one that even had audiovisual rooms and had allowed people to get on the Internet. Fortunately this one had held on to the card catalogue rather than bend to the popular perception that digital was always better. After about 20 minutes they both sat down with several books each and started reading. The light coming in through the large front windows was enough to easily read by.  
首要任务是去图书馆。这是一个相当大的图书馆，甚至有视听室，允许人们上网。幸运的是，这个图书馆保留了卡片目录，而不是屈服于数字总是更好的流行观念。大约 20 分钟后，他们各自拿着几本书坐下开始阅读。透过宽敞的前窗照射进来的光线足以轻松阅读。

Shinji flipped through his first and was started on his second when Asuka drew his attention to her book. "It says that UPS systems have bee used for years for short term power outages, mostly to keep delicate computer systems running. Some of the larger ones can power for quite some time." There was a picture on the facing page of a large scale one. It was basically a large brown box about 10 feet long and 3 or 4 feet wide that stood about 6 feet off the ground.  
当真嗣翻阅着他的第一本书并开始看第二本时，明日香吸引了他的注意力，向他展示她的书。“书上说，UPS 系统多年来一直被用于短期停电，主要是为了保持精密的计算机系统运行。一些大型的 UPS 系统可以供电相当长的时间。”对面页上有一张大型 UPS 系统的图片。它基本上是一个大约 10 英尺长、3 到 4 英尺宽的棕色大箱子，离地面约 6 英尺高。

"That is pretty big. I don't know how we would get that up there."  
“那东西挺大的。我不知道我们怎么把它弄上去。”

"Well assuming we wanted to put something like that at the house, I am sure we could commandeer a flat bed, and a crane or something."  
“嗯，假设我们想在家里放一个那样的东西，我肯定我们可以征用一辆平板车和一台起重机之类的。”

Shinji looked doubtful. He did not know anything about cranes or large electrical devices. Of course about a month ago, he did not know anything about motorcycles either. They looked through the books and a few more ideas came up but nothing really good other than solar panels. Biodeisel, too much chemistry. Power cells, too hard to obtain hydrogen. Banks of batteries, too much work to convert power back and forth, and it was dangerous to do that.  
真嗣看起来有些怀疑。他对起重机或大型电气设备一无所知。当然，一个月前，他对摩托车也一无所知。他们翻阅了书籍，又冒出了一些想法，但除了太阳能电池板之外，没有什么真正好的方案。生物柴油，化学成分太多。电池组，获取氢气太难。蓄电池组，转换电力太费事，而且这样做很危险。

After an hour and a half of looking they kept Asuka's book, and went to the prefecture land bureau. Inside where maps of the area and details about rights of way for the power lines and associated equipment for the power industry. There was a nuclear power plant in the nearby town of Takahashi. They decided that they had better go there first to see about schematic drawings of the power turbines and the switching yards that they would have to redirect power to the house through.  
经过一个半小时的查阅，他们保留了明日香的书，前往县土地局。里面有该地区的详细地图以及电力线路和相关设备的通行权信息。附近的高桥镇有一座核电站。他们决定最好先去那里，看看能否获取电力涡轮机和开关站的示意图，以便将电力重新引导至家中。

Takahashi was only about 20 miles away, and it took no time to get there. Since there was no telling what shape the facility was in due to a lack of maintenance they drove up cautiously checking out the containment domes to see that they were indeed intact. Seeing that they were, they entered the administration area, and started looking for their paperwork. The file room was past two guard stations, and in a somewhat secluded part of the building. There were no windows in the room that led outside so the door was kept open to provide light.  
高桥距离这里仅约 20 英里，抵达那里几乎不费时间。由于无法预知因缺乏维护设施的状况，他们谨慎地驱车前行，检查着那些 containment domes 是否完好无损。确认它们完好后，他们进入了行政区域，开始寻找他们的文件。档案室位于两道警卫站之后，是建筑中较为隐蔽的一部分。房间内没有通向外部的窗户，因此门保持敞开以提供光线。

Wiring diagrams abounded. Mostly of the large-scale power converters, transformers, safety subsystems internal to the plant. Finally the found diagrams of the grid showing substations, switching yards, and plans for each. Pulling these rolls out of their drawers, they laid them out in the hallway to try and make sense of them. It was a dizzying array of wires and intersections, and switches and such. But there were simpler diagrams showing instructions for shutting down parts of the power grid from the supply side.  
电路图随处可见。主要是大型电力转换器、变压器、工厂内部的安全子系统的图纸。最终，他们找到了展示变电站、开关场以及每个计划的电网图。他们从抽屉中取出这些卷轴，在走廊上铺开，试图理清头绪。这是一系列令人眼花缭乱的电线、交叉点和开关等。但也有更简单的图纸，显示了从电源侧关闭电网部分的操作说明。

While they figured out which switchyards they would have to visit, they munched on their meager lunch, and within a couple of hours they had their course of action figured out.  
在他们确定需要访问哪些调车场的同时，他们啃着简陋的午餐，不出几个小时，他们就制定出了行动方案。

There were 4 substations on the way to the house that would have to be checked out. Most likely they would have to just keep redirecting the power to only one sector at each until it flowed into the area they were in. From there they would likely have to find a way to hit the breakers on the transformers at each house in the area, thereby giving them access to every drop of power.  
前往房屋的路上有 4 个变电站需要检查。最有可能的是，他们必须不断将电力重定向到每个站的一个区域，直到电力流入他们所在的区域。从那里，他们可能需要找到方法在每个房屋区域的变压器上触发断路器，从而获得每一丝电力的使用权。

These substations were in a relatively straight line from the windmill farm to their area. If they drove along the power line's right of way, it would be much faster than going down the highway trying to find out how to get to them.  
这些变电站从风车农场到他们所在区域大致呈直线分布。如果他们沿着输电线路的通行权行驶，会比沿着高速公路寻找如何到达它们要快得多。

So with the cheese and crackers gone, they rolled the set of schematics up, and went outside to borrow one of the power company's trucks with a set of keys off of the key rack at one of the desks. The motorcycles were put in the lobby just in case there was a storm or high wind.  
于是，奶酪和饼干一扫而空后，他们将那套图纸卷起来，走出室外，从办公桌上的钥匙架上取下一串钥匙，借用了一辆电力公司的卡车。摩托车则被放置在大厅内，以防遭遇暴风雨或强风。

The small but powerful cab-over-engine trucks were packed with tools and spare parts of different kinds. There were several manuals in the console mostly phone numbers and authorization codes. One however was a checklist for different types of tasks. It ran step by step for resetting tripped breakers, performing preventative maintenance checks and most other routine functions of the field guys.  
这些小型但动力强劲的驾驶室上置引擎卡车装满了各种工具和备用零件。中控台内放着几本手册，主要是电话号码和授权码。但其中一本却是针对不同任务的检查清单，详细列出了重置跳闸断路器、执行预防性维护检查以及现场人员的大多数常规操作的步骤。

While Shinji made the drive out to the windmill farm, Asuka looked through the checklists. There was even one for switching power over to other circuits. On the system used by this power company the incoming line was run through a splitter that would then feed it to 5 or 6 other transformers to push the electricity out to the next box. All they had to do was shunt power from all of the circuits not concerning them at that splitter and they were good.  
当真嗣驾车前往风车农场时，明日香翻阅着这些检查清单，甚至有一份是关于切换电源到其他电路的操作指南。在这家电力公司的系统中，输入线路通过一个分流器，然后分配给 5 到 6 个其他变压器，将电力输送到下一个箱子。他们只需在那个分流器上将不相关的电路的电力转移走，一切就搞定了。

The best thing though was the simplicity of the instructions. In an effort to make painfully clear to the worker how not to be electrocuted, each step was explained in very minute detail. Shinji remembered Kensuke telling him about how most armies of the world had started printing instructions on their equipment that was on a 3rd grade reading level. Some even had pictures on them to help out. Anyone could operate it.  
最棒的是操作说明的简洁明了。为了确保工人清楚如何避免触电，每一步都以极其细致的方式解释。真嗣记得健介曾告诉他，世界上大多数军队已经开始在装备上印制三年级阅读水平的说明书，有些甚至还配有图片以辅助理解。任何人都能操作。

Asuka had read through the entire checklist a couple of times by the time they were pulling up to one of the wind turbines. The first switching station was situated across the road from it.  
当他们驶近其中一个风力涡轮机时，明日香已经把整个检查清单读了好几遍。第一个开关站就位于道路对面。

It was quite windy out. Nearly 40 miles an hour. Asuka found that she could lean into the wind without falling over, and they spent a few minutes having fun trying to see how far they could lean without falling.  
外面风很大，几乎达到了每小时 40 英里。明日香发现她可以迎风倾斜而不至于摔倒，于是他们花了几分钟时间玩起了看谁能倾斜得更远而不倒的游戏。

The turbine was very large. Neither had been so close to one before. The blades where whizzing by and from inside issued a sort of humming whirring sound, which was good. That meant that it was producing power. Wind turbines were not like windmills where you could allow the windmill to turn without pumping water. When turbines were shut down, the turbine locked down on the rotator shaft and the blades would not spin.  
涡轮机非常庞大。两人都未曾如此近距离接触过。叶片飞速旋转，从内部传来一种嗡嗡的呼啸声，这很好。这意味着它在发电。风力涡轮机不同于风车，风车可以任其转动而不必抽水。当涡轮机关闭时，涡轮会锁定在旋转轴上，叶片便不再旋转。

They unlocked the gate to the switchyard and managed to locate the main splitter with little difficulty. However the hard part was getting the access cover off. The nuts on the bolts holding it down were old and nearly rounded, but with much effort, they finally got all four off, and lifted the access cover to expose the most amazing set of wires and conduits either had seen. Well maybe not. A lot of the equipment associated with Eva was even worse than this, only it was much larger.  
他们解开开关场的门锁，没费多少劲就找到了主分接开关。然而，真正困难的是打开访问盖。固定它的螺栓上的螺母老旧且几乎磨圆了，但经过一番努力，他们终于拆下了所有四个螺母，并掀开访问盖，露出了两人见过的最令人惊叹的电线和管道系统。也许也没那么夸张。与 Eva 相关的许多设备比这更复杂，只是体积更大。

"OK it says insert the key into lock B and rotate to 'Change'." Asuka read aloud as Shinji performed the actions.  
“好的，上面说将钥匙插入锁 B 并旋转至‘更改’。”明日香大声读出，同时真嗣按照指示操作。

"OK. That was easy enough."  
“好的，这很简单。”

"Now set." Asuka studied the plans for this substation for a moment. "1, 3, 4, and 5 to 'Standby'."  
“现在设置好了。”明日香仔细研究了一下这个变电站的计划。“1、3、4 和 5 号设为‘待命’。”

"Alright." This was easier than he had thought it would be.  
“好吧。”这比他想象的要容易。

"Now while holding the red wire, on to the Main bus, cut the green and white wires simultaneously."  
“现在，拿着红线，接到主总线上，同时剪断绿线和白线。”

Shinji's face fell. "What?! Let me see that." He grabbed for the manual.  
真嗣的脸色一沉。“什么？！让我看看。”他伸手去抢手册。

Asuka grinned deviously and held on to the manual. "OK, OK. Push the yellow button, then when the red button pops up, push it."  
明日香狡黠地笑了笑，紧抓着手册不放。“好吧，好吧。先按黄色按钮，等红色按钮弹出来，再按它。”

Around them the steady hum of power diminished dramatically. Also, several unlabeled lights winked out as well.  
四周稳定的电力嗡鸣声骤然减弱。同时，几盏未标记的灯光也相继熄灭。

"It says turn key to 'engaged' and close cover."  
“上面写着将钥匙转到‘启动’并合上盖子。”

Shinji looked at her incredulously. "That's it? I would have thought that there would be more to it than that. You know, really high-powered technical stuff." He rotated the key, and closed the cover.  
真嗣难以置信地看着她。“就这样？我还以为会有更复杂的步骤，你知道的，那种真正高深的技术活。”他转动钥匙，合上了盖子。

"Apparently it used to be, but with advances in technology comes at least a certain level of automation for everything." There was that "I am a genius" tone again.  
"显然曾经是，但随着技术的进步，至少在一定程度上，一切都实现了自动化。" 他又带上了那种"我是天才"的语气。

"Well if that is all we have to look forward to, we won't have any problems at all. Except with these covers." He stated with a grunt. After tightening the last bolt down they closed the gate, and got back in the truck.  
"好吧，如果这就是我们期待的一切，那我们不会有任何问题。除了这些盖子。" 他咕哝着说。在拧紧最后一个螺栓后，他们关上了门，回到了卡车上。

So it went. The drove down the cleared right of way to get to the rest of the stations. It was pretty easy driving. The next two were almost if not exactly the same. It was nearing 4:30 as they pulled up to the final substation, and they noticed the clouds starting to move in. It looked like it might rain that night.  
就这样，他们沿着清理出的通道驶向其他站点。驾驶相当轻松。接下来的两个站点几乎完全相同。当他们接近最后一个变电站时，时间已近 4:30，他们注意到云层开始聚集。看起来那晚可能会下雨。

The gate was closed but unlocked and they went right in. Shinji performed the change over while Asuka read the plans. He was just closing the cover and screwing it down when Asuka turned to leave, and was confronted with several large and menacing dogs. As she backed away they advanced, a few of them baring their teeth.  
大门虽已关闭却未上锁，他们径直走了进去。真嗣进行着转换操作，而明日香则在阅读计划。他刚合上盖子并拧紧螺丝，明日香转身欲走，却迎面遭遇了几只庞大且凶猛的狗。她一步步后退，它们则步步紧逼，其中几只露出了獠牙。

Shinji paled and was unable to do anything as the lead canine tensed and lunged at Asuka, who still stood closer to them. He saw her raise her arm to try and deflect the flying dog, but it latched onto that arm, and bit down hard. Two of the others had moved just a split second after the first. One jumped at Shinji, the other attacked Asuka's leg.  
真嗣脸色苍白，面对领头的狗蓄势待发并扑向仍站在它们近旁的明日香，他无能为力。他看到她举起手臂试图挡开飞扑而来的狗，但它紧紧咬住了她的手臂，狠狠地咬了下去。另外两只狗在第一只行动后的瞬间也动了。一只扑向真嗣，另一只则攻击明日香的腿。

As the dog sprang at Shinji, he felt the adrenaline pump into his system. Unfortunately the dog made it to him before he could react well. It clamped onto his upper arm, and knocked him to the ground, shaking its head back and forth vigorously. Shinji felt the flesh tear a little in his arm, but it did not really hurt that much. Some dull pain did make it through the cloud of the adrenaline, though.  
当狗向真嗣扑来时，他感到肾上腺素涌入体内。不幸的是，狗比他能做出有效反应要快得多。它咬住了他的上臂，将他撞倒在地，猛烈地来回甩头。真嗣感觉到手臂上的肉被撕裂了一点，但并没有感到太痛。尽管如此，一些隐约的疼痛还是穿透了肾上腺素带来的迷雾。

It almost felt like he was taking his time, but in reality it all happened in a split second. He raised the wrench he held, and beat the animal across the bridge of its nose, which it displayed very prominently to him. They dog veritably flew off of his arm, the upper part of its muzzle broke and bleeding.  
这一切几乎像是他在故意拖延时间，但实际上却发生在转瞬之间。他举起手中的扳手，猛击那动物显眼地朝他展示的鼻梁。那狗几乎是从他的手臂上飞了出去，上颚断裂，鲜血直流。

He rose to his knees, and pulled back to hit the first dog over the head. The sickening crunch was terrible. The animal collapsed instantly dead from acute brain trauma. With the back swing of the wrench he caught another dog in the side, breaking a rib, and possibly puncturing a lung. Seeing that two were critically injured and one dead, the remaining dogs scattered, nearly lodging themselves in the gate trying to get out three at a time. It was all over in a few seconds.  
他跪起身来，向后一拉，猛击第一只狗的头部。那令人作呕的碎裂声极为可怕。那动物因急性脑损伤瞬间倒地毙命。他用扳手的回摆击中了另一只狗的侧身，打断了一根肋骨，可能还刺穿了肺部。看到两只狗重伤，一只死亡，剩下的狗四散奔逃，几乎卡在门里，三只同时试图逃出。这一切在几秒钟内就结束了。

Asuka lay bleeding, balled up around her arm, and wrapping her good leg around the wounded one. Shinji's own injured arm was nearly useless now that the power in liquid form was wearing off in his blood stream. He dropped the wrench, and huddled over Asuka, turning her over to inspect. The fire in his left upper arm was just starting to register. She had several deep punctures to her arm, some superficial bites to her leg, and a large bump at the back of her head where she had fallen when tripped up by the second attacker.  
明日香躺在地上，鲜血直流，蜷缩着身体护住受伤的手臂，用好腿紧紧缠绕着受伤的那条。真嗣自己的伤臂随着血液中液态能量的消退，几乎失去了作用。他丢下扳手，蜷缩在明日香身旁，将她翻过身来检查。左上臂的灼痛感刚刚开始显现。她的手臂上有几处深刺伤，腿上有一些浅表咬痕，后脑勺还有一个大肿块，是她在被第二个袭击者绊倒时撞到的。

It was very difficult to get her to the car. He could imagine how much pain she was in. As he was putting her in the passengers seat, she hung her head, and leaned in several directions, barely managing to stay upright. Shinji did have the presence of mind to retrieve the wiring diagrams and schematics from the ground.  
将她扶到车上非常困难。他能想象她承受着多大的痛苦。当他把她安置在副驾驶座上时，她垂着头，左右摇晃，勉强保持直立。真嗣还算清醒，从地上捡起了电路图和设计图。

As he drove, he pulled Asuka down to lie in the seat. She swam in and out of consciousness, sometimes groaning, sometimes silent. It was a very fast 15-minute drive home. Shinji nearly lost control of the truck as he skidded around corners.  
开车时，他让明日香躺下。她时而清醒，时而昏迷，有时呻吟，有时沉默。这 15 分钟的车程异常迅速。真嗣在转弯时几乎失控，卡车滑行着绕过弯道。

After they had moved into the house, at one point they had stocked up on medical supplies. It was inevitable that something would happen and they would need stuff. A medical book had given an outline for the ideal medical supply stock to have around the house. They had also supplemented it with things that they would likely need that they could not afford to take the time to go into town for.  
搬进房子后，他们曾一度备足了医疗用品。总会有事情发生，需要用到这些东西。一本医疗书籍提供了理想的家庭医疗储备概要。他们还额外补充了一些可能急需、无法抽时间进城购买的物品。

Hypodermics, some of the more high-powered drugs, antibiotics, and some vaccines. That included human rabies immunoglobulin and human diploid cell vaccine as well. Several years prior advances had been made in the development of many of these vaccines that allowed them to be stored at room temperature almost indefinitely. So they were still useable even after the power went out.  
注射器、一些高效药物、抗生素和几种疫苗。这包括人狂犬病免疫球蛋白和人二倍体细胞疫苗。几年前，许多疫苗的研发取得了进展，使得它们能在室温下几乎无限期保存。因此，即使在断电后，这些疫苗依然可用。

Shinji ground to a sudden halt in the driveway, and flung open the door of the truck. Pulling Asuka out, he carried/dragged her unconscious form inside, finding new strength in being home again.  
真嗣在车道上突然停下，猛地打开卡车车门。他拽出昏迷的明日香，抱着/拖着她的身体进屋，回到家的感觉让他重获力量。

Since the beginning of this new life they had been living, Shinji had become a fairly knowledgeable medic. He pulled Asuka's shirt and pants off, and did not even register the fact that he now had her like this. Inspecting the wound closer showed him that there were really only three punctures on the arm. Two on top and one on the other side. The leg however was not so superficial as he had originally thought. The dog had lost a tooth in the wound when Shinji had hit it in the side, and it was still sticking out.  
自从他们开始这种新生活以来，真嗣已经成为了一位相当有知识的医疗人员。他脱下明日香的衬衫和裤子，甚至没有意识到自己现在正这样对待她。仔细检查伤口后，他发现手臂上实际上只有三个刺孔。两个在上，一个在下。然而，腿部的情况并不像他最初认为的那样浅显。当真嗣击中那只狗的侧面时，狗的一颗牙齿脱落并卡在了伤口中，至今仍未取出。

Working quickly he gathered the supplies and went to work first ensuring that the bleeding had indeed stopped, extracted the tooth, then cleaned the wounds. Soap and water washed the blood away and helped to stop the possibility of rabies and other infections. He wrapped the arm tightly to keep the wound as immobile as possible. The leg was much the same way, but it would take a bit longer to heal. Afterwards, he gave her the immunoglobulin shot to her arm, and laid her in her bed in the bedroom with her head tilted to the side.  
他迅速收集了必需品，首先确保出血确实停止了，然后取出牙齿，清洁伤口。肥皂和水洗去了血液，有助于防止狂犬病和其他感染。他用绷带紧紧包裹手臂，尽可能保持伤口不动。腿部的情况也类似，但愈合时间会更长一些。之后，他在她的手臂上注射了免疫球蛋白，然后将她安置在卧室的床上，头偏向一侧。

Then it was time to work on himself. It was fairly quick work, not much to it, but he was starting to regret killing the one and wounding the other dogs. But there was nothing that could have been done. He had heard of the viciousness of wild dogs, and was certain that they would have killed he and Asuka both if he had not done something.  
随后，他开始着手处理自己的伤势。这并不复杂，但他开始后悔杀死了那只狗并重伤了另一只。然而，他知道别无选择。他曾听说过野狗的凶残，确信若不采取行动，自己和明日香都会丧命。

With his upper arm and shoulder fixed, he gave himself the shot, and started packing away the supplies. He was in a lot of pain so he took a couple of painkillers, but they hardly helped. He picked up the ruined clothes, deciding to throw them away. They were bloody and torn open.  
固定好上臂和肩膀后，他给自己注射了一针，并开始收拾医疗用品。剧痛难忍，他服了几片止痛药，但效果甚微。他拿起破烂的衣服，决定丢弃。它们沾满血迹，被撕裂开来。

While he was outside putting them in the garbage, he made a visit to the breaker box, and flipped the main circuit breakers to the house that were cutting off their outside power access, and the lights came on inside. He smiled weakly. It had worked. Now they would have to kill the power to the other houses around the area just to keep them from creating problems and wasting electricity.  
在外面将衣物扔进垃圾桶时，他顺便去了断路器箱，切换了切断外部电源的主断路器，屋内的灯光随即亮起。他虚弱地笑了笑。计划成功了。现在他们不得不切断周边房屋的电源，以防制造麻烦和浪费电力。

He returned inside to Asuka's room to keep an eye on her, but soon fell asleep. He was tired from the activity and excitement.  
他回到明日香的房间，打算看着她，但不久便睡着了。活动和兴奋让他感到疲惫。

Quite sometime later, Asuka awoke in her sleeping bag. The pattering of rain against the window was soothing, and it brought her comfortably back to reality, even if it was a painful reality. At first she had a hard time even figuring out where she was. Then with the pain came the memory. Shinji and she had been attacked by a pack of wild dogs. She turned her head groggily and saw him slumped against the wall, shirtless with a large bandage over his upper left arm. Then she realized she was nearly naked.  
过了许久，明日香在睡袋中醒来。雨点敲打窗户的声音令人安心，即便现实痛苦，也让她舒适地回到了其中。起初她难以分辨自己身处何地，随后疼痛带来了记忆。她和真嗣曾遭到一群野狗的袭击。她昏昏沉沉地转过头，看到他斜靠在墙上，赤裸上身，左上臂缠着一大块绷带。接着她意识到自己几乎一丝不挂。

She thought about getting up to put something on, but the sleeping bag was warm, and it felt soooo good. A few more minutes wouldn't hurt..  
她考虑起身穿上些衣物，但睡袋温暖舒适，感觉实在太好了。再多躺几分钟也无妨……

### Chapter 7 Day29

To keep characters straight when they are speaking to themselves in their dreams the character themselves will retain their name, the character in the minds of others with be noted with a prime. Ergo the Asuka in someone else's or perhaps another version in her own mind will be Asuka'.  
为了在角色梦中自言自语时保持清晰的角色区分，角色本人将保留其名字，而他人心中或另一个版本的她将以撇号标注。因此，在他人心中或她自己心中的另一个版本将被称为 Asuka'。

---
Asuka swam dazedly in and out of consciousness. Her head hurt and a dull throbbing pain was emanating from several places on her body. At one point she found herself in her pilot chair, confronted with the scowling visage of herself. The Asuka in front of her was perched over the control stem that rose from the floor in front of her.  
Asuka 恍惚间在清醒与昏迷之间游走。她的头很痛，身体多处传来隐隐的抽痛。有一次，她发现自己坐在驾驶椅上，面对着一脸怒容的自己。眼前的 Asuka 俯身在从地板升起的控制杆上。

"So, you had to have Shinji rescue you again." Asuka' stated flatly. "And I thought that you could do things for yourself. You should have seen how smug and satisfied he looked when he was taking care of you."  
"所以，你又得让真嗣来救你了。" 明日香平淡地说道。"我还以为你能自己处理事情呢。你没看到他照顾你时那副得意洋洋、心满意足的样子吗？"

"That is not true. Shinji would never be that way. Besides, I was just taken by surprise, I could have done it myself if I had been more ready." Asuka said trying to defend the boy.  
"那不是真的。真嗣绝不会那样。再说了，我只是猝不及防，如果我准备得更充分，我自己也能做到。" 明日香试图为男孩辩护道。"

"You don't sound very convinced. I think that you maybe wanted him to rescue you. The helpless little girl who can't protect herself. She is always injured, and tries to act so self-assured. But she can't be her own person." Her words tore deep into Asuka's ego. She could take care of herself. She did not need any rescuing. Shinji might care for her, but she could defend herself.  
"你听起来不太有说服力。我觉得你可能是想让他来救你。那个无法自保的无助小女孩。她总是受伤，还试图表现得那么自信。但她无法独立。" 她的话深深刺痛了明日香的自我。她能照顾好自己。她不需要任何救援。真嗣或许关心她，但她能自卫。"

But she couldn't push him away. She really did enjoy his company, and she didn't want to be alone any more. But the seeds had been planted. She worried that she might actually be weak.  
但她无法推开他。她确实喜欢他的陪伴，也不想再孤单一人。然而，种子已经种下。她担心自己可能真的软弱。

NO! She was strong, damnit, and she had shown that on many occasions. She did not need to punish Shinji for being noble enough to take care of her when she found herself off balance.  
不！她很坚强，该死的，她多次证明了这一点。她不需要因为真嗣足够高尚在她失衡时照顾她而惩罚他。

But she had not been off balance. She had been beaten. She had just let him do all the work, and had not stood up for herself.  
但她并没有失衡。她是被击败了。她只是让他做了所有的工作，而没有为自己挺身而出。

Asuka' watched as her words and accusations took their toll. She did not want to be left behind because of some stupid infatuation with this boy. Then Asuka found herself floating back to consciousness. Her head hurt again, the pain returning, but at least she was back in her room.  
明日香看着自己的话语和指责产生了效果。她不想因为对这个男孩的愚蠢迷恋而被抛下。随后，明日香发现自己飘回了意识中。她的头又痛了起来，疼痛再次袭来，但至少她回到了自己的房间。

Shinji was awake and looking at her when she opened her eyes. They took a moment to focus, and she turned her head to see him. Her eyebrows drew down to hood her eyes.  
当她睁开眼睛时，真嗣已经醒了，正看着她。她的视线花了片刻才聚焦，转头望向他。她的眉毛皱起，遮住了眼睛。

"Asuka? How do you feel? Does it hurt bad?" The worry showed plainly on his face, as he leaned over her.  
“明日香？你感觉怎么样？很疼吗？”他的担忧清楚地写在脸上，俯身靠近她。

"Well, well. The invincible Shinji. I had wondered where you had gone. Always saving the day against all odds. Don't even think that you did me a favor by fighting off those dogs. I could have and would have had you hadn't stepped in." The venom dripped from her voice, and Shinji backed away momentarily as he wondered about the Asuka in front of him. She was even more like the old Asuka than she used to be. Contemptuous and cold hearted.  
“哼，哼。无敌的 Shinji。我还在想你跑哪儿去了。总是在绝境中拯救一切。别以为你打跑了那些狗是帮了我的忙。就算你没插手，我也能搞定。”她的话语中带着毒液，Shinji 一时退缩，心中对眼前的 Asuka 感到疑惑。她比以往更像过去的 Asuka 了。蔑视一切，冷酷无情。

Shinji looked at Asuka in wonder, his mouth agape. He had not seen this coming. But as Asuka turned her nose up at him, he surprised her as well. He narrowed his eyes, finally angry. He usually did not get angry at her, but he had been so worried about her, and she wakes up and treats him like this.  
Shinji 惊讶地看着 Asuka，嘴巴微张。他没想到会这样。但当 Asuka 对他嗤之以鼻时，他也让她吃了一惊。他眯起眼睛，终于愤怒了。他通常不会对她发火，但他一直那么担心她，而她醒来后却这样对待他。

Shinji's face reddened and Asuka watched him ball a fist up, and for a moment she was afraid that he was angry enough to hit her. She knew full well that her words had hurt the boy, and that she had shown him no gratitude for his quick action, that had probably saved her life. The look that he gave her was frightening. It was not just angry but furious. That she would say something like that to him after the past month that they had been through had totally taken him by surprise. It was proof enough that you could never understand someone totally.  
真嗣的脸涨得通红，明日香看着他握紧了拳头，有那么一刻她担心他气得会打她。她很清楚自己的话伤到了这个男孩，而且她没有对他的迅速行动表示感激，那很可能救了她的命。他投来的目光令人害怕。不仅仅是生气，而是愤怒至极。在经历了过去一个月的风风雨雨后，她竟然还对他说出那样的话，这完全出乎他的意料。这足以证明，你永远无法完全理解一个人。

His voice was low, but Asuka heard it clearly, and almost shivered at its sound. "Asuka, I feel sorry for you. You will never know happiness, because you will never be happy with anyone. I like you Asuka, and I had thought that you might like me, or at least tolerate me. I guess I should have known better. If you don't need any help from me, I won't offer anymore." He closed his eyes for a moment, then stood and left the room.  
他的声音很低，但明日香听得清清楚楚，几乎因这声音而颤抖。“明日香，我为你感到难过。你永远不会知道幸福，因为你永远不会对任何人感到快乐。我喜欢你，明日香，我曾以为你也许会喜欢我，或者至少能容忍我。我想我应该更明白些。如果你不需要我的帮助，我不会再提供了。”他闭上眼睛片刻，然后站起身离开了房间。

Asuka felt many things about what had happened. She was amazed at her own actions as much at Shinji's. She had no right to act like that toward him. She regretted her impulse to scorn him, but she held onto the lingering traces of that emotion wondering about it. What was the overwhelming compulsion to treat him as inferior? Why did he have to dominate like that?  
明日香对所发生的一切感到百感交集。她对自己的行为和真嗣的反应同样感到惊讶。她没有权利那样对待他。她后悔自己冲动地蔑视他，但她仍紧抓着那种情绪的余韵，思索着。那种强烈的冲动，为何要视他为劣等？为何他必须那样主导一切？

She lay back listening to the pitter-patter of the rain on the window, and the sound of trees swaying back and forth in the wind. Even though she had been unconscious for most of the previous night, it had not been restful, and in only a few minutes, she was swallowed up by sleep, descending into the darkness as before.  
她躺下，听着雨点敲打窗户的滴答声，以及风吹动树木来回摇摆的声音。尽管前一晚大部分时间她都处于昏迷状态，但并未得到真正的休息，不一会儿，她便被睡意吞没，再次沉入黑暗之中。

Outside, Shinji stood in the rain. It was calming somehow. Maybe it was the cold of the water, or the randomness of the noises. He was still angry. It galled him that she could be so heartless. He had thought that she had left that behind, had become someone who could accept people's kindness for what it was. Instead she had tricked him. She was still the spoiled girl he had known, conceited in that she thought that she was too good for anyone.  
外面，真嗣站在雨中。不知为何，雨水带来了一丝平静。或许是水的冰冷，或是雨声的无序。他依然愤怒。她如此无情，让他感到恼火。他原以为她已经抛下了过去，变成了一个能接受他人善意的人。然而她却欺骗了他。她仍是那个他所认识的被宠坏的女孩，自负地认为她高人一等。

Frustrated, he banged his fist on the railing of the porch, splashing the pooled water off of it.  
他沮丧地用拳头猛击门廊的栏杆，将积聚在上面的水花溅开。

Asuka opened her eyes to find herself back at the apartment. She was sitting at the dining room table staring across at herself. Asuka' had a slight smirk that she flashed at herself across the table.  
明日香睁开眼睛，发现自己回到了公寓。她坐在餐桌旁，盯着对面的自己。对面的'明日香'嘴角微微上扬，向她投来一抹得意的微笑。

Asuka sat glowering at her alter-ego. "So who the hell are you, that you think that you can tell me how I should act?"  
明日香怒视着她的另一个人格。“你到底是谁，凭什么觉得自己可以告诉我该怎么行事？”

"I think you know me. I used to be you. Then you turned your back on me because you thought you found something better." Asuka' darkened a moment, and then resumed her smirk.  
"我想你了解我。我曾经就是你。然后你背弃了我，因为你以为找到了更好的。" 明日香的神情暗淡了一瞬，随即又恢复了她的冷笑。

"Well I don't need you anymore. I did find something better, and I like it this way. I am happier with Shinji than I ever was alone, even if he is still shy and kind of spineless. At least he is honest with me. I don't want to hurt him like this."  
"好吧，我不再需要你了。我的确找到了更好的，而且我喜欢这样。和真嗣在一起，我比独自一人时更快乐，即使他依然害羞且有些软弱。至少他对我是真诚的。我不想像这样伤害他。

"You didn't enjoy it? That familiar warmth; the knowledge that you are above him? You shouldn't have to let anyone do for you what you can do for yourself. You deserve better than him."  
"你不享受那种感觉吗？那种熟悉的温暖；那种凌驾于他之上的认知？你不应该让别人为你做你自己能做的事。你值得比他更好的人。

"I think that he and I are pretty good together. At least better than I would be alone. When I woke up on that beach, he was there to get me out of the weather and bandage my arm, and cook dinner."  
"我觉得我和他在一起挺好的。至少比一个人强。当我醒来时，在海滩上，是他帮我避风，包扎我的手臂，还做了晚饭。"

"Aww, the little married couple-" Asuka' was interrupted as her more emotionally centered counterpart abruptly stood and swung at her, connecting evenly with her jaw.  
"哎呀，小两口真甜蜜——" 阿斯卡的话被突然站起来的情绪更加稳定的同伴打断，对方一拳正中她的下巴。"

"I don't want you, I don't need you, and I never want you to interfere with me and my business again. What I do is for me to worry about."  
"我不需要你，我不依赖你，我再也不想让你插手我和我的事情。我的事我自己会处理。"

The girl on the floor found that she could not deny the power of the words. If her primary ego did not want her interference, she was no longer welcome. She melted into nothingness showing one last defiant look to Asuka as she went.  
地板上的女孩发现自己无法否认这些话语的力量。如果她的主要自我不希望她介入，那么她便不再受欢迎。她化作虚无，临走前向明日香投去最后一瞥挑衅的目光。

Asuka sat back down wondering how it was that things could be so definite with something so indefinite as feelings and emotions. How could she quash an unwanted past ego like she was a real person? Where these personas of her self what she had heard Shinji talking about? The Shinji in her mind and whatever? She was the Asuka in her own mind. And Asuka' was the remnants of the old Asuka?  
明日香坐回原位，思索着为何如此不确定的情感和情绪能带来如此明确的决定。她怎能像对待真人一样压制一个不想要的过去自我？这些自我形象是她从真嗣那里听到的吗？她心中的真嗣和那些是什么关系？她是自己心中的明日香。而 Asuka'是旧明日香的残余吗？

Had the transubstantiation of Third Impact done this to her. Allowed for the incorporation of waste ego? Regardless, she had dealt with it. When she woke up she would have to find some way of fixing what she had done.  
第三次冲击的质变是否对她造成了这样的影响。允许了废弃自我的融合？无论如何，她已经处理了这个问题。醒来后，她必须找到某种方法来修复她所做的事情。

Shinji sat motionlessly in the comfortable chair that was aimed out the window. The rain fell in sheets over the lake. This day was markedly colder than the previous ones. That not only due to the weather. Shinji had thought several times of leaving Asuka here to her righteous self. It would serve her right to find only loneliness at the end of her gloating attitude.  
真嗣一动不动地坐在那把面向窗外的舒适椅子上。雨水如幕般倾泻在湖面上。这一天明显比之前的要冷得多。这不仅仅是因为天气。真嗣曾多次想过把明日香留在这里，让她独自面对自己的命运。她那傲慢的态度最终只会换来孤独，这正是她应得的。

He heard Asuka's door creak open and softly close behind her. He was silent with his back turned to her as she walked up behind him. For a moment he was afraid that she was going to hurt him. To her thinking, his saving her was an insult. And she had only one way of dealing with things like that.  
他听到明日香的门吱呀一声打开，又轻轻地在她身后关上。他沉默着，背对着她，当她走到他身后时。有那么一刻，他担心她会伤害他。在她看来，他救了她是对她的侮辱。而她只有一种方式来处理这类事情。

Instead her hand rested on his shoulder. "Shinji?" It was almost a pleading request for attention. "I should not have been that way for you. You rescued me, and probably saved my life. You worried over me, and did your best to fix me, and then I threw it in your face. I never wanted to be mad at you. I just had some trouble figuring out what to think about it."  
相反，她的手搭在了他的肩膀上。“真嗣？”这几乎是一个恳求关注的请求。“我不应该那样对你。你救了我，很可能还救了我的命。你为我担心，尽你所能地修复我，而我却把这一切甩在你脸上。我从没想过要生你的气。我只是有些难以理解这一切。”

Shinji looked up and smiled at her relieved that she was behaving like her recently normal self. He liked her this way. She was understanding and articulate. She could talk to him as an equal. She circled around in front of him, and took his hand, pulling him up into an embrace.  
真嗣抬头看着她，露出笑容，庆幸她恢复了最近正常的模样。他喜欢她这样。她善解人意，口齿伶俐。她能以平等的身份与他交谈。她绕到他面前，拉起他的手，将他拉入怀中。

She could not let him think that this was an act. Asuka realized that for Shinji to leave her would be a devastating blow, and she was surprised to find that it was not just due to her own fear of loneliness, but she dreaded the thought of being without him too. And here she had put that in jeopardy. She hugged him tightly despite the pain in her arm and leg, breathing into his damp shirt at his shoulder. "Please say something, Shinji."  
她不能让他以为这是在演戏。明日香意识到，对真嗣来说，离开她将是一个沉重的打击，她惊讶地发现，这不仅仅是因为她害怕孤独，她也害怕没有他的生活。而此刻，她却将这一切置于危险之中。尽管手臂和腿上的疼痛，她还是紧紧抱住他，将脸埋在他湿润的衬衫肩头。“真嗣，说点什么吧。”

Shinji liked the way Asuka felt. It was warm, much as he had remembered his mother's similar embrace. He was acutely conscious of her arms circling around his sides, and resting in the small of his back. He put his own around her, and whispered into her ear. "You feel good Asuka." That was all he could really think about at the moment.  
真嗣喜欢明日香的感觉。温暖如初，正如他记忆中母亲类似的拥抱。他敏锐地意识到她的手臂环绕在他的腰间，停留在他的后腰。他也将自己的手臂环绕在她身上，对着她的耳朵轻声说：“明日香，你感觉真好。”那一刻，他只能想到这些。

She snickered a little, and replied. "You feel good too. I am so sorry that I acted the way I did. It won't happen again."  
她轻声笑了一下，回答道：“你也感觉很好。我很抱歉我那样做了。不会再发生了。”

The rain outside drowned out the rest of the whispered exchange that they shared.  
外面的雨声淹没了他们之间低语的其余部分。

A while later Shinji looked at his watch; it read 4:30. Bleary eyed, he looked outside. It had stopped raining, but had remained overcast. Asuka was still on top of him. He had lain down in the easy chair, propping the legs up and laying back so that Asuka could hug him. She was presently straddled across him, nuzzled into the base of his neck. However, looking down he found that he had a great view of... He looked away. She was not wearing a bra anymore.  
过了一会儿，真嗣看了看手表；显示 4:30。他睡眼惺忪地望向窗外。雨已经停了，但天空依旧阴沉。明日香仍然压在他身上。他躺在安乐椅上，把腿翘起来，向后躺下，让明日香可以拥抱他。她现在跨坐在他身上，脸埋在他的颈窝。然而，低头一看，他发现自己有一个绝佳的视角……他移开了视线。她已经没穿胸衣了。

Asuka was lost in Shinji's warmth. For a day that had started out with so much pain and anger, it had turned out alright. She knew that Shinji was looking at her almost exposed breasts, but that was of little importance. Let him look.  
明日香沉浸在真嗣的温暖中。这一天开始时充满了痛苦和愤怒，但最终还是平安度过了。她知道真嗣正盯着她几乎暴露的胸部，但这并不重要。让他看吧。

Shinji rubbed his hands up and down her back, patting her every now and then. From now on, they would have to be a little more careful when outside. It had not occurred to him that without people, animals that had been domesticated would turn wild. While there was no direct evidence that the dogs that attacked them had been owned by anyone before, he realized the possibility. They would need to get some kind of protection.  
真嗣用手上下抚摸着她的背，时不时轻拍几下。从今往后，他们在户外必须更加小心。他之前没想到，没有人类，被驯化的动物会变得野性。虽然没有直接证据表明袭击他们的狗之前有主人，但他意识到了这种可能性。他们需要某种保护措施。

The obvious answer was guns, but he didn't know the first thing about guns except firing really big ones like the pallet rifle and plasma sniper rifle in Unit 01. But where would they get guns anyhow?  
显而易见的答案是枪支，但他对枪支一无所知，除了像零号机上的炮弹步枪和等离子狙击步枪那样的大型武器。但无论如何，他们该去哪里弄到枪呢？

There might be a JSDF post nearby. They would surely have weapons. Maybe even a variety of stuff to choose from. At the moment the only thing that really mattered was the red headed German on his chest.  
附近可能有一个自卫队驻地。他们肯定有武器。或许还有多种选择。眼下唯一真正重要的是他胸前的红发德国女孩。

Asuka raised her head, and looked at Shinji. "What is it?"  
明日香抬起头，看着真嗣。“怎么了？”

"What do you mean?" "你这是什么意思？"

"You moved a little like you wanted to get up." She smiled a little.  
“你刚才动了一下，好像想起来。”她微微一笑。

"Oh. I was just thinking. We may want to think about getting some guns or something. I can't be carrying a wrench around everywhere I go, you know?" He smiled back. "I think you should smile more often. I like it."  
"哦，我只是在想。我们或许该考虑弄些枪支什么的。我总不能走到哪儿都带着一把扳手，你知道吧？" 他回以微笑。"我觉得你应该多笑笑。我喜欢看你笑。"

Asuka shrugged a little. "I have had more to be happy about recently than before." She backed off of him, standing up. The pain of her injured leg and the stiffness of her knees from kneeling straddled over Shinji was terrible, but it was worth it.  
明日香微微耸肩。"最近我比以前有更多值得高兴的事。" 她从他身上退开，站了起来。受伤的腿和因跪跨在真嗣身上而僵硬的膝盖带来的疼痛十分剧烈，但这一切都是值得的。

"It could have waited. You did not have to get up."  
"其实可以等一等的。你没必要非得起来。"

"Well if we want to do it today, we had better get going." She said looking outside.  
“如果今天想完成的话，我们最好现在就出发。”她边说边望向窗外。

Shinji hurried to his room to change clothes as did Asuka. All she had on was a shirt and sweatpants, and if she was going outside, she wanted something a little more rugged.  
真嗣急忙跑回房间换衣服，明日香也一样。她当时只穿着一件衬衫和运动裤，如果要出门，她希望穿得更结实些。

They were ready to go in about 20 minutes, and once Shinji identified the JGSDF post for their part of the prefecture, they drove off in the electric company truck to retrieve their motorcycles. If it had still been raining, Shinji would have just left the motorcycles at the power plant. The rain would have been too painful, as well as cold.  
大约 20 分钟后，他们准备妥当。真嗣确认了所在县区的自卫队驻地后，便开着电力公司的卡车去取回他们的摩托车。如果还在下雨，真嗣本打算让摩托车留在发电厂。雨水会带来剧痛，而且寒冷难耐。

Once they had the bikes back they made for the JGSDF camp. It was only a few miles outside of town. The Japanese Ground Self Defense force was nothing like its special ops counterparts. They had a few armored vehicles and less sophisticated equipment. But it was not for these things that they had come. It took a little searching, but finally they found the arms room. Unfortunately the door was locked with a large steel padlock with a huge casehardened steel sheath over the hasp, making it very difficult to cut.  
他们取回自行车后，便直奔日本陆上自卫队营地。营地离镇上不过几英里远。日本陆上自卫队的装备远不及特种部队的精良，只有几辆装甲车和一些较为简单的设备。但他们此行的目的并非这些。经过一番搜寻，他们终于找到了武器库。遗憾的是，门上挂着一把巨大的钢锁，锁身覆盖着厚实的硬化钢套，极难切割。

Within the admin area they found a key rack with a hundred or more keys, and set about looking for the one that would open it. None of them did. Then they found a safe next to the commander's desk labeled "Controlled Keys" in red. There was a key labeled the same, and within a few minutes they had the safe open, and a wad of keys that surely were meant for the arms room.  
在行政区，他们发现了一个挂有上百把钥匙的钥匙架，开始逐一寻找能打开那把锁的钥匙。但无一奏效。随后，他们在指挥官办公桌旁发现了一个标有红色“管制钥匙”字样的保险箱。里面有一把同样标记的钥匙，几分钟后他们便打开了保险箱，取出了一串显然是用来开武器库门的钥匙。

A long skinny key opened the huge lock on the door, and once inside they found stacks of gun racks each one lock secured. There were M4 carbines, Steyrs, M9 pistols, as well as a few M249 SAW light machine guns.  
一把细长的钥匙轻松打开了那把巨锁，进入库内，只见一排排枪架，每架都上了锁。架上陈列着 M4 卡宾枪、斯太尔步枪、M9 手枪，还有几挺 M249 轻机枪。

"Whoa." It was quite a selection of firepower. All in all they would likely be shooting most things at close range, so the M9 pistol made sense. But there was the possibility of going hunting in the future, so they would need a good high-powered rifle.  
"哇哦。" 这火力选择相当丰富。总的来说，他们可能会在近距离对付大多数目标，所以 M9 手枪是合理的。但未来可能会有打猎的机会，因此他们需要一支高性能的步枪。

"Do they have any bullets in here for these?" Shinji asked turning around. Asuka was already digging through a metal locker that was backed against a wall. Sure enough there was a metal ammo box with some bullets in it.  
"这些枪有子弹吗？" 真嗣转过身问道。明日香已经在翻找靠墙的一个金属柜子了。果然，里面有一个金属弹药箱，装着一些子弹。

"Rounds." She corrected when she found it.  
"是弹药。" 她找到时纠正道。

"Ok, rounds. How many in there?" He unlocked one of the racks, and swung the locking bars out of the way. "Want to fire one a few times before we take it? Try before you buy."  
“好的，弹药。这里有多少？”他解锁了一个枪架，将锁杆移开。“想在拿走之前先试射几发吗？试试再买。”

"Hmm there are about 120 rounds. Sure. Are there any magazines around?" There were a few in the desk to their right, and within a few minutes, they had 10 rounds loaded in 2 magazines.  
“嗯，大约有 120 发。当然。附近有弹匣吗？”右边桌上有几个，几分钟后，他们已经将 10 发子弹装进了两个弹匣。

Stepping outside, they took their respective M-4s and put the magazine in. Shinji fired first. Or rather he clicked. Turning the weapon over in his hands, he tried figuring out what had gone wrong.  
走到外面，他们各自拿起 M-4 步枪，装上弹匣。真嗣先开火。或者更确切地说，他只是按了下扳机。他翻转着手中的武器，试图弄清楚哪里出了问题。

"Hey. You have to pull back the charging handle. Like this." She pulled back a handle located just in front of the buttstock, and released it with a satisfying cluchunk sound. "You have to load the first round yourself."  
“嘿，你得拉回这个充电手柄。像这样。”她拉回了一个位于枪托前方的手柄，然后松开，发出了一声令人满意的咔嚓声。“你得自己装上第一发子弹。”

Shinji mimicked the action, and was rewarded with the same sound. "Where did you learn that?"  
真嗣模仿着这个动作，也听到了同样的声音。“你从哪儿学来的？”

Asuka blushed just a tiny little bit. "Well I tried dating one of the security guys there at NERV. He showed me some things about the weapons they had. All of these are basically the same."  
明日香微微脸红了一下。“嗯，我试着和 NERV 那边的保安人员约会过。他教了我一些他们武器的知识。这些基本上都差不多。”

That really didn't bother Shinji. He knew how she acted, and could not really fault her for it. Putting the weapon to his shoulder he - "And switch the safety lever." Asuka added. He looked on the side of the handle and sure enough there was a safety switch labeled SAFE/SEMI/BURST.  
这真的没有困扰真嗣。他知道她的行为方式，也无法真正责怪她。将武器扛在肩上，他——“然后切换保险杆。”明日香补充道。他看向握把侧面，果然有一个标有 SAFE/SEMI/BURST 的保险开关。

He rotated the selector from SAFE to SEMI, and tried again. The weapon fired, and bucked in his hands a little. He had expected a lot of kick. The weapons in the Eva were quite strong, and they had a disproportionate amount of recoil when fired. It was also very loud. His ears rang, and it was hard to hear a little.  
他将选择器从 SAFE 转到 SEMI，再次尝试。武器开火，手中的枪微微后坐。他本以为会有很大的后坐力。Eva 中的武器非常强劲，射击时会产生不成比例的后坐力。而且声音也非常大。他的耳朵嗡嗡作响，很难听清声音。

He fired off several more rounds, getting used to the feel of the gun. Then Asuka took her turn. When they returned to the arms room, they decided to take a couple of the pistols too. There was no telling when they might need them. Also they collected the remaining rounds in the ammo can, manuals for both weapons, several magazines, and some odds and ends for both the M-4s and the M-9s, and stowed them in the saddlebags on the motorcycles.  
他又发射了几发子弹，逐渐习惯了枪的感觉。接着明日香轮到她射击。当他们回到武器室时，他们决定也带上几把手枪。谁也不知道什么时候会需要它们。此外，他们还收集了弹药箱中剩余的子弹，两种武器的说明书，几个弹匣，以及 M-4 和 M-9 的一些零碎物品，并将它们装进了摩托车上的鞍袋里。

Just in case they ever needed to get back into the room, they left the rack keys inside, but closed and locked the door and kept the main door key with them. When they ran out of ammunition, they would have to find some more. As it was, they had better start home because it was getting dark.  
以防万一他们需要再次进入房间，他们把钥匙留在了架子上，但关上门并上了锁，随身携带了主门钥匙。当他们的弹药用完时，就得再找一些。眼看天色渐暗，他们最好开始回家。

Once they arrived back at the house, they parked in the garage and went inside. They had gone most of the day without food, and Shinji did not really feel like cooking. Fortunately they had found some snack items at the local grocery. Shinji read highlights from the weapon manuals detailing normal capabilities, function and maintenance while Asuka ate. They sat on the carpeted floor stuff strewn about.  
一回到房子，他们把车停在车库里，然后进屋。他们几乎一整天都没吃东西，真嗣其实不太想做饭。幸运的是，他们在当地杂货店找到了一些零食。真嗣一边吃，一边从武器手册中读出正常功能、操作和维护的要点，而明日香则坐在铺着地毯的地板上，周围散落着各种物品。

"Wow, it says here that cyclic rate of fire is 800 rounds per minute. That is a lot."  
“哇，这里写着射速是每分钟 800 发。这可真不少。”

"Not really. They have guns that can fire much, much faster. Of course 800 rounds a minute is more than enough for me. We aren't going to be in pitched battle or anything."  
“不太准确。他们有射速快得多的枪。当然，每分钟 800 发对我来说已经绰绰有余了。我们不会陷入激战什么的。”

Shinji shrugged and kept reading. They would need to go back the next day and get cleaning supplies. According to the manual it was not a good idea to fire a dirty weapon. They could go and pick that up in the morning, and be back with enough time to trip the circuit breakers on the houses around them. There was no need really to do anything to the transformers when you could cut power to the house at the breaker box.  
真嗣耸了耸肩，继续阅读。他们第二天需要回去拿清洁用品。根据手册，发射脏武器可不是个好主意。他们可以在早上就去取回清洁用品，然后有足够的时间去切断周围房屋的电路断路器。实际上，当你可以在断路器箱处切断电源时，根本没必要对变压器做任何事情。

They were both thankful that they had managed to get the power going again. Shinji was amazed that it had been as easy as it was. He realized also that he may have inadvertently helped Asuka to feel the way she had this morning. He had been taking charge for a while now, and it seemed to him that he was leaving her behind.  
两人都很庆幸他们设法恢复了电力。真嗣惊讶于这件事竟然如此简单。他也意识到，自己可能无意中帮助明日香找回了今早的感觉。他这段时间一直在主导一切，似乎让她有些跟不上节奏了。

"Asuka, you want to go back tomorrow? We need to get a few things. I had not known to pick up a cleaning kit."  
"明日香，你想明天回去吗？我们需要买些东西。我之前不知道要带清洁工具。"

Asuka produced a small olive drab bag with a large bulge in the middle. "One like this?" She smiled. Just before they had left, she had snagged it figuring they would need it.  
明日香拿出一个橄榄绿的小包，中间鼓鼓的。“像这样的吗？”她微笑着。在他们离开之前，她就预料到会需要它，于是顺手拿了一个。

"Yeah, one a lot like that. I didn't know you got one."  
"是啊，非常像那个。我不知道你也拿了。"

"Well there are some things you just don't know about me." Her nose wrinkled and she winked at him.  
"好吧，有些关于我的事情你根本不知道。" 她的鼻子皱了皱，朝他眨了眨眼。

"Oh yeah? Like what?" Shinji put the book down. Was this flirting? It was meaningless banter, but he was having fun.  
"哦，是吗？比如什么？" 真嗣放下书。这是在调情吗？虽然只是无关紧要的闲聊，但他玩得很开心。

"Well that would be telling, and that's no fun. Some things about a woman should never be told." She looked away, but watched him out of the corner of her eye.  
"嗯，那可不能说，说出来就没意思了。有些关于女人的事是永远不该说的。" 她转过头去，却用眼角余光观察着他。

"Well how about. if I. TICKLE it out of you!" He sprang at her, toppling her over, and sitting above her, fingers digging lightly into her sides. "How do you like that?"  
"那好，如果我. 用挠痒痒的方式逼你说出来怎么样！" 他猛地扑向她，将她推倒，然后坐在她身上，手指轻轻地在她腰间挠动。"你觉得这招如何？"

Asuka laughed until her sides hurt, and she finally managed to get Shinji to stop. He was smiling down at her from above. She breathed deeply trying to regain her breath.  
明日香笑得肚子都疼了，终于设法让真嗣停了下来。他微笑着俯视着她。她深呼吸试图恢复呼吸。

"Asuka. I. I want to tell you something, and I don't want you to be mad ok?" He looked at her plaintively now, his smile fading.  
"明日香，我. 我有件事想告诉你，希望你不要生气，好吗？" 他现在恳切地看着她，笑容逐渐消失。

"Ok. I promise. You can tell me." Her tone growing serious.  
"好的，我保证。你可以告诉我。" 她的语气变得严肃。

"I know that you probably don't feel this way, but I hope that you can understand. Ever since we woke up back there on the beach I have liked you. And that's not to say I never liked you before, but you are different now. I would like to think that you changed for me. I have tried to be the kind of person you want to be with. And. I guess what I am trying to say is." Asuka put her finger to his lips.  
"我知道你可能不这么想，但我希望你能理解。自从我们在海滩上醒来后，我就喜欢上你了。这并不是说我以前不喜欢你，但你现在不同了。我愿意相信你是为我而改变的。我努力成为你想与之在一起的那种人。而，我想说的是……" 明日香用手指轻触他的嘴唇。

"Shhh. It's OK. You don't have to." She knew what was coming, and it was exciting, but frightening at the same time. What do you say to something like that? How do you wrap your mind around something that big?  
"嘘，没关系。你不必说。" 她知道即将发生什么，既兴奋又害怕。面对这样的事情，你该说什么呢？如何让自己的思维去适应如此巨大的变化？

"No, it is something that I want to get off my chest, and I have to say it now." He paused for a moment collecting the will to tell her what he wanted her to know. "Asuka, I love you. I have for a long time, but before I would never have told you. I hope that you won't hate me for saying that, but that is the way it is." He ended resolutely as if that phrase affirmed all he had said.  
“不，这是我想要倾诉的心事，我必须现在说出来。”他停顿了一下，鼓起勇气告诉她他想让她知道的事情。“明日香，我爱你。已经很久了，但以前我绝不会告诉你。我希望你不会因为我这么说而恨我，但事实就是如此。”他坚定地结束了这句话，仿佛这句话肯定了他所说的一切。

Asuka swallowed hard. He had said the L word and there was not much that she could do about it. Did she love him? She knew that she liked him well enough, but for being 4 letters, love was an enormous concept. She had tried to comprehend it many times, and it had totally eluded her. That someone would like you so much that they would want to be with you forever? She had never really had a family, and she had toyed occasionally with the notion that Shinji could be her family.  
明日香艰难地咽了咽口水。他说出了那个 L 字，她对此无能为力。她爱他吗？她知道自己足够喜欢他，但爱这个四个字母组成的词，却是一个巨大的概念。她多次试图理解它，但它完全避开了她。有人会如此喜欢你，以至于他们想永远和你在一起？她从未真正拥有过一个家庭，偶尔她会幻想真嗣能成为她的家人。

But life is not picture perfect like that. It would be nice if she could just tell him that she loved him too, and they could be like a family. But what would that mean? She couldn't think. She was hot, and frustrated, and she did not know what to say.  
但生活并不像那样完美无缺。如果她能直接告诉他她也爱他，他们能像一家人一样，那该多好。但这意味着什么？她无法思考。她感到燥热、沮丧，不知道该说什么。

"Shinji. I don't know what I feel. I'm not good at this sort of thing. Being open I mean. You are going to have to give me some time to figure it out for myself. I guess. I can accept that you love me. But right now I don't know what to think." She sighed heavily, and hoped that what she had said did not hurt him. It would be her luck that she had just shattered the frail relationship they had been building.  
"真嗣。我不知道我是什么感觉。我不擅长这种事。我是说，敞开心扉。你得给我点时间，让我自己想清楚。我想。我可以接受你爱我。但现在我不知道该怎么想。" 她重重地叹了口气，希望她的话没有伤害到他。如果她刚刚毁掉了他们正在建立的脆弱关系，那真是她的运气。

Shinji was a little disappointed. But Asuka had not outright rebuked him. She was unsure and rather than tell him what he wanted to hear and then realize later that it was not true, she wanted to explore her feelings and tell him truthfully. He smiled at her, and nodded, and hugged her tightly. "I will wait for you. I am sorry that I had to say that." The irony did not escape him that they were in the same relative position as when they had awoken on the beach. Only now embracing, realizing a relationship.  
真嗣有点失望。但明日香并没有直接拒绝他。她不确定，与其现在告诉他他想听的话，然后又发现那不是真的，她宁愿探索自己的感情，然后诚实地告诉他。他朝她微笑，点点头，紧紧地拥抱了她。"我会等你。很抱歉我不得不这么说。" 他们现在的处境与在海滩上醒来时相似，只是现在他们拥抱在一起，意识到了这段关系，这其中的讽刺他没有忽视。

He smelled her hair, and loved the way it smelled. When Asuka realized this is what he was doing, she smiled a little. "OK Third Child. That is about enough of that."  
他闻着她的头发，喜欢它的味道。当明日香意识到他在做什么时，她微微一笑。"好了，第三少年。这就够了。"

"Could I ask you a favor?" Shinji said as he rose up. Asuka nodded. "Could you not call me Third Child anymore? I never really liked being a pilot, and I don't want to be reminded of that life anymore than I have to be."  
"能请你帮个忙吗？" 真嗣站起身来说道。明日香点了点头。"你能不能不要再叫我第三适格者了？我从来就不喜欢当驾驶员，不想再被提醒那段生活了。"

Asuka understood and nodded again. He had that right. She had seen some of the things that he had witnessed when her mind touched his during Third Impact. It had been frightening. He had released a lot of pent up anger and frustration during that time, and she still had not fully understood all that had happened. But the point was that he was no longer the Third Child.  
明日香理解地点了点头。他有这个权利。她曾在第三次冲击时通过心灵接触看到他所经历的一些事情，那非常可怕。那时他释放了大量积压的愤怒和挫败感，而她至今仍未完全理解所有发生的事情。但关键是，他不再是第三适格者了。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

"Hmm?" "嗯？"

Shinji paused for a moment. "Do you remember when you were in the hospital?"  
真嗣停顿了一下。"你还记得你在医院的时候吗？"

"I remember going there, but I don't remember being there really. Why?" She tilted her head, wondering where this was going.  
"我记得去过那里，但我不记得真正在那里过。为什么？" 她歪着头，想知道这话题会引向何方。

"I just wanted you to know something." He paused again, trying to figure out how he could tell her. She was going to be angry any way she looked at it. "It was after I had killed… the seventeenth angel, and I visited you in the hospital. I had hoped that you might wake up while I was there. That would make me fell better. I think I just wanted to talk to you. The way you were, you could listen, and you would not be angry at me for saying what I had to."  
"我只是想让你知道一些事。" 他再次停顿，试图找出如何告诉她。无论从哪个角度看，她都会生气。"那是在我杀死了……第十七个使徒之后，我去医院探望你。我曾希望你在我探望期间能醒来。那会让我感觉好些。我想我只是想和你谈谈。你当时那样，可以倾听，也不会因为我必须说的话而对我生气。"

"Shinji, will you get to the point? This can't be that hard to say."  
"真嗣，你能说到重点吗？这应该不难说出口。"

She had no idea. "Anyhow, I wanted you to wake up, and I don't know how it happened, but I saw you naked, and I just. and."  
她完全没想到。“总之，我想让你醒来，我不知道怎么发生的，但我看到了你的裸体，我就……然后……”

That had been a memory? Asuka had seen that, but she had thought he was relating that to something else that was going on. She had never even considered that he would do something like that.  
那是一段记忆？明日香曾看到过那一幕，但她以为他是在讲述其他正在发生的事情。她从未想过他会做出那种事。

The understanding part of her grappled with the idea, and to a degree it grossed her out. It had happened, and there was nothing that could be done about it now. Shinji was obviously sorry for it, but that did nothing to rectify the situation. She felt violated. And in a very un-Asuka-like move, she forgave him that. She had been depressed before, and had come very close to killing herself. This, when you think about it, is even more of a perversion. Not sexually perhaps, but nonetheless it was taking something that was beautiful, and making it terrible.  
她理智的一面在努力接受这个想法，某种程度上让她感到恶心。事情已经发生了，现在无计可施。真嗣显然对此感到抱歉，但这并不能改变现状。她感到被侵犯了。以一种非常不明日香的方式，她原谅了他。她之前也曾抑郁过，甚至差点自杀。这件事，仔细想想，更是一种扭曲。或许不是性方面的，但无论如何，它夺走了原本美好的东西，使之变得可怕。

"Shinji. I don't want you to think that you got away with that. But it is just not something that I want to think about right now. I have enough to figure out to last me a while. Right now, I think it is late, and I think I want to go to bed. I am sorry that I could not tell you what you wanted to hear earlier, but sometimes one person is ready to love before another."  
"真嗣，我不想让你觉得你逃过了这一劫。但这确实不是我现在想考虑的事情。我有太多需要理清的头绪，足够让我忙上一阵子。现在，我觉得很晚了，我想去睡觉。很抱歉我之前没能告诉你你想听的话，但有时候一个人准备好去爱另一个人之前，是需要时间的。"

Shinji took that as an indication that she wanted him to get up. Asuka climbed off of the floor, and hobbled to the bathroom. She wanted to take a shower before going to bed.  
真嗣从她的举动中察觉到她希望他起身。明日香从地板上爬起来，一瘸一拐地走向浴室。她想在睡觉前洗个澡。

"Good night Shinji. I like you, and I hope that you can live with that for now." When the door closed behind her, Shinji was grateful. He had worried for so long that he would never be able to tell her about that. He was ashamed that he had done it, and the only way he could feel any better about it would be to confess it to her.  
"晚安，真嗣。我喜欢你，希望你现在能接受这一点。" 当她身后的门关上时，真嗣感到一阵欣慰。他曾长时间担心自己永远无法向她坦白。他为自己所做的事感到羞愧，唯一能让他感觉好一点的办法就是向她坦白。

As he wandered to his room, he rolled her words over in his head. She might love him yet. She would be only the second person that had told him that they loved him. He was glad that it was her. She was exciting and vibrant, full of life nowadays. And he had a thing for that red hair too.  
当他漫步回房间时，她的那些话在他脑海中反复回响。她或许还爱着他。她是第二个对他说出“我爱你”的人。他很高兴是她。她如今充满活力，生机勃勃。而且，他对那头红发也有着特别的情愫。

The sound pouring out of the shower almost drowned out Asuka humming. She was singing some foreign tune to herself, and Shinji listened to the sound of her voice for a few moments. The splashing water stopped after a few minutes as Asuka stepped out of the shower.  
淋浴间传出的水声几乎盖过了明日香哼唱的声音。她在自顾自地哼着一首异国小调，真嗣聆听着她的歌声。几分钟后，水花声停歇，明日香从淋浴间走了出来。

Shinji hurried back to his room, and went to bed before she toweled off and came out. He had said a lot tonight. He wished that he could have been more romantic. He had been mulling over the idea of love for the past few days, and knew that he indeed loved her. He never wanted to leave her, and he hated seeing her in pain. He found himself wanting to touch her tenderly, but he was unable to bring himself to risk her reaction. He wanted to be with her, but he knew that sometimes he was best off giving her space. Love was something that he could not understand. What made you love one person, and not another? And why did he love Asuka of all people?  
真嗣急忙回到自己的房间，在她擦干身体出来之前就上床了。今晚他说了很多。他希望自己能更浪漫些。过去几天里，他一直在思考爱的概念，并确信自己确实爱她。他从未想过离开她，看到她痛苦让他心生厌恶。他发现自己渴望温柔地触碰她，但又不敢冒险去试探她的反应。他想和她在一起，但也知道有时最好给她一些空间。爱是他无法理解的东西。是什么让你爱上一个人而不是另一个人？而他为什么偏偏爱上了明日香？

Kaji had told him that love by its very nature is not a definite thing. It doesn't have rules. There are no pre-qualifications. And there was really no denying it. If it was going to happen, it would happen. And it could do it without warning.  
加持曾告诉他，爱本质上是不确定的东西。它没有规则。没有先决条件。而且真的无法否认。如果它要发生，就会发生。而且它可以在没有预警的情况下发生。

The bathroom door opened, and light spilled out into the now dark hallway, then it abruptly shut off.  
浴室门打开了，灯光洒进现在昏暗的走廊，然后突然熄灭了。

"I'm sorry I can't answer you Shinji. Sweet dreams."  
"对不起，真嗣，我无法回答你。愿你有个好梦。"

Shinji lay there and wondered what the next day would bring him.  
真嗣躺在那里，思索着明天会给他带来什么。

### Chapter 8 Day85

In the two months since the dogs attacked them, Shinji and Asuka had healed quickly. Their bandages had come off and Asuka's arm had even stopped hurting. Shinji had been afraid of the possibility of rabies so he had administered shots to Asuka and vice versa.  
自从两个月前被狗袭击以来，真嗣和明日香恢复得很快。他们的绷带已经拆掉，明日香的手臂也不再疼痛。真嗣担心狂犬病的可能性，因此他给明日香注射了疫苗，反之亦然。

He had also waited for her. And the waiting hurt. He worried that every day that went by, the more Asuka forgot about his pledge of love for her. Had he been too quick to do so? To profess his love to someone who did not, and would not love him in return? They got along well enough. The occasional fight did spice things up a bit. Asuka had not yet gotten used to doing her share of the cleaning, and Shinji was tired of doing nearly everything himself. She had gotten better about it though.  
他也一直在等待她。等待是痛苦的。他担心每一天过去，明日香会越来越忘记他对她的爱的承诺。他是不是太快了？向一个不爱他，也不会爱他的人表白？他们相处得还不错。偶尔的争吵确实增添了一些趣味。明日香还没有习惯做她那份清洁工作，而真嗣厌倦了几乎所有事情都自己做。不过她在这方面已经有所改善。

In the mean time, they both had noticed that it was getting colder. At first it was not so noticeable. Then one morning dawned and it was positively frigid outside. The day had worn on and turned into a regular hot day, but the next day dawned the same way. There was the possibility that as some point the Earth was coming back into its original alignment.  
与此同时，他们俩都注意到天气正在变冷。起初并不那么明显。然后有一天早晨，外面确实变得非常寒冷。那天渐渐过去，变成了一个平常的热天，但第二天又是同样的情况。有可能在某一刻，地球正在恢复到它原来的位置。

With the prospect of winter came the alarm of being caught unprepared. As it was, they had no backup fuel, no snow vehicles, no cold weather clothing, no food stores, and most importantly, no real cold weather experience. Germany had been left with at least an autumn each year, but no winter. It would get around 40 degrees, and then warm up again. But if they were faced with a winter, there was no telling what they would have to deal with.  
随着冬天的临近，他们开始担心准备不足。事实上，他们没有备用燃料，没有雪地车辆，没有御寒衣物，没有食物储备，最重要的是，没有真正的寒冷天气经验。德国每年至少会有一个秋天，但没有冬天。气温会降到大约 40 度，然后又回暖。但如果他们面临一个冬天，谁也不知道他们将不得不面对什么。

In the last couple of weeks Shinji had begun cutting and splitting firewood, culling the dead trees first. They had managed to find a hydraulic wood splitter in town. Asuka had started venturing into town to find things that would help them through the winter. She had stocked them up on canned vegetables and soups, canned meats, staples like rice, flour, sugar, and she had even managed to find an economy-sized bag of powdered milk. In one of the clothing stores, there was a section that was stocked with "cold weather gear" but it was mostly sweaters and such. She had improvised some large coats from a couple of windbreakers lined with several sweaters and down filling from pillows.  
在过去的几周里，真嗣开始砍伐并劈开木柴，首先清理枯死的树木。他们在镇上设法找到了一台液压木劈机。明日香也开始冒险进城寻找能帮助他们度过冬天的物品。她为他们囤积了罐装蔬菜和汤品、罐头肉、大米、面粉、糖等主食，甚至还找到了一大袋经济装的奶粉。在一家服装店里，有一部分货架堆满了“御寒装备”，但大多是毛衣之类的。她用几件防风夹克内衬多件毛衣和枕头的羽绒填充物，临时改制了几件大外套。

This particular morning was cooler than normal. The house had gotten down to about 60 degrees and the thermostat turned the heating on. Shinji had begun having problems sleeping recently, so when it came on, he got up and started cooking breakfast. They had killed a pig recently and once Asuka had finished killing and dressing it, he had gone about butchering it. It was amazing what you could learn from books at the library. They had also found some chickens. Since they had two sheds outside, and one was only half full of stuff, they had cleaned it out, and stored what they wanted to keep in the other one. Then converted the first into their chicken house. Eggs were a luxury that they were not going to pass up. This morning, Shinji was making bacon and eggs with homemade bread that he would toast.  
这天早晨比往常凉爽。屋内温度降到了大约 60 度，恒温器启动了暖气。最近真嗣睡眠一直不好，所以暖气一开，他就起床开始做早餐。他们最近宰了一头猪，阿斯卡处理完宰杀和剥皮后，他便着手分割。图书馆的书真是无所不教。他们还找到了一些鸡。由于外面有两个棚子，其中一个只装了一半东西，他们便清理出来，把想保留的物品搬到另一个棚里。随后将第一个棚改造成了鸡舍。鸡蛋可是他们不愿错过的奢侈品。今早，真嗣正在做培根煎蛋，搭配自制的面包，准备烤着吃。

They had both been very busy learning the skills that they needed now. He wondered why these things were never taught as a matter of course in school. There was never any telling when you would need something like this, and these skills would help insure your survival. Easy things like building a fire. Cooking and sewing. First aid.  
他们俩都忙着学习现在所需的技能。他不禁疑惑，为什么学校不把这些作为常规课程来教。你永远不知道何时会需要这些技能，而这些技能能助你生存。比如生火、烹饪和缝纫这些简单的事。还有急救。

While the bacon sizzled in the pan, Shinji was busy scrambling the eggs. The first time he had cooked eggs for Asuka, he had fried them, and she had nearly refused to eat them. She hated the way they oozed yolk out. The cooking pork smell had managed to drag her from her sleep, and soon she was exiting her own room to join Shinji.  
培根在平底锅中滋滋作响，真嗣正忙着打散鸡蛋。第一次为明日香煎蛋时，他选择了炒蛋，结果她差点拒绝吃。她讨厌蛋黄流出来的样子。烹饪的猪肉香味成功地将她从睡梦中唤醒，不久她便走出自己的房间，加入真嗣。

"Good morning, Shinji." She smiled at him as he turned to look at her. Then she winked.  
“早上好，真嗣。”她微笑着看向他，当他转头望向她时，她眨了眨眼。

"G-good morning Asuka. How did you sleep?" He wondered what was up with her today. Usually she got out of bed at least semi-cranky and gradually got better as the morning wore on.  
“早、早上好，明日香。你睡得怎么样？”他好奇她今天怎么了。通常她起床时至少会有些烦躁，随着早晨的推移情绪才会逐渐好转。

"Oh, you know. I woke up a couple of times earlier on, but otherwise I was OK. How about you?"  
"哦，你知道的。我之前醒了几次，但总的来说还好。你呢？"

"I only got about 5 hours." He looked it too. Maybe it was just a temporary thing.  
"我只睡了大约五个小时。" 他看起来也确实如此。或许这只是暂时的。

"You making scrambled eggs?" She tried to look around him.  
"你在做炒蛋吗？" 她试图从他身边看过去。

"Yup. You should know by now that I only make scrambled eggs for you."  
"是啊。你应该早就知道我只为你做炒蛋。"

Smiling, Asuka nodded and started washing plates from last night's dinner to put on the table. "Oh by the way, I checked on the LP last night. We need more."  
微笑着，明日香点点头，开始清洗昨晚晚餐的盘子准备摆上桌。“哦对了，我昨晚检查了液化石油气罐。我们快用完了。”

"Running low huh? OK I think I saw a LP truck around town a few days ago. I can drive it up here and give us a fill up. Probably should just keep it here too." Their heating, water heating, stove and range top all worked on liquid petroleum gas. If they ran out, they would be forced to resort to their wood-burning stove in the living room.  
“快用完了吗？好的，我记得前几天在镇上看到过一辆液化石油气罐车。我可以开过来给我们加满。或许应该直接留在这里。”他们的暖气、热水器、炉子和灶台都使用液化石油气。如果用完了，他们就只能依靠客厅里的柴火炉了。

The wood-burning stove was a soapstone freestanding stove with a catalytic converter. The catalyst would recycle the smoke and burn it too causing the stove to reach temperatures of 1200 and 1300 degrees or more. It also kept the chimney cleaner than normal. While they had not had to use it yet, they had made a trial run of it, and it had heated them out of the house.  
这款柴火炉是采用皂石材质的独立式炉具，配备有催化转换器。催化剂能循环利用烟雾并将其燃烧，使炉温达到 1200 至 1300 度甚至更高。同时，它也比普通炉具更能保持烟囱清洁。尽管他们尚未实际使用过，但已进行过试运行，结果炉子热得让他们不得不离开屋子。

Shinji turned the bacon over, and continued mixing the eggs, then added a little salt, some pepper, and a few squirts of Tabasco. Even though the McIlhenny farm had been wiped out by Second Impact, bottles of the red hot liquid could still be found in many stores since their actual sauce producing fields had been in South and Central America. The ones in the United States were used to produce quality seeds.  
真嗣翻了翻培根，继续搅拌鸡蛋，然后加入少许盐、一些胡椒粉和几滴塔巴斯科辣椒酱。尽管麦克汉尼农场在第二次冲击中被摧毁，但这种红色辣酱仍能在许多商店找到，因为其真正的酱料生产地位于南美和中美洲。美国境内的则是用于生产优质种子。

With the bacon done, Shinji put the bread in the toaster and then poured the egg mixture in and stirred the increasingly fluffy substance. Within a minute or two it was ready, and he put it on plates, grabbed the toast, and sat down with Asuka for breakfast.  
培根煎好后，真嗣将面包放入烤面包机，随后倒入蛋液并搅拌，使其逐渐变得蓬松。一两分钟后，蛋液便准备好了，他将之盛入盘中，拿起烤好的面包，与明日香一同坐下享用早餐。

"Mmm Shinji, you know I like your cooking. This reminds me of Germany."  
"嗯，真嗣，你知道我喜欢你做的菜。这让我想起了德国。"

"Glad you like it." Shinji said wolfing down the food. It was quite hot, but it was good. It was also over in only a few minutes. But they were full, and you could not ask for much more than that.  
"很高兴你喜欢。" 真嗣边说边狼吞虎咽地吃着。虽然很烫，但味道很好。不一会儿就吃完了。但他们已经饱了，这已经足够了。

After Asuka had put the dishes in the sink, she stepped outside, and found that it was much colder than they had thought. The thermometer said it was nearly 40 degrees!  
阿斯卡把碗碟放进水槽后，走到外面，发现比他们预想的要冷得多。温度计显示已经接近 40 度了！

She went back in after only a few seconds. "Shinji, we had better dress more warmly today. It is pretty cold out there, and with it overcast like this, it probably isn't gonna get much better."  
她只在外面待了几秒钟就回来了。“真嗣，今天我们最好穿得暖和些。外面相当冷，而且天阴沉沉的，估计不会有什么好转。”

Shinji agreed, and headed for his room to get the jacket that Asuka had made for him. It was warm and very comfortable. He also got some thick work boots that she had found for him. They had insulation in them that would help if he were out in the cold and wet for too long.  
真嗣同意了，便去房间拿阿斯卡为他做的夹克。那件夹克既暖和又舒适。他还拿了阿斯卡找到的厚工作靴，里面有隔热层，如果他在寒冷潮湿的环境中待得太久，这会很有帮助。

He joined her back in the living room, and they left together. This time out, they left the motorcycles, and took the truck that they had gotten. It was a four-wheel drive, just in case there was something they absolutely needed after the winter was in full force. Asuka drove it into town with Shinji in the passenger seat. She needed to get used to driving.  
他回到客厅与她会合，两人一起出门。这次他们没有骑摩托车，而是开上了他们得到的那辆卡车。这是一辆四驱车，以防冬天完全到来后他们急需什么东西。阿斯卡载着真嗣坐在副驾驶座上，开车进城。她需要习惯开车。

Even though they did not find the LP truck that Shinji had seen, they did manage to find the LP filling station that serviced Okayama and the outlying area. It had three 20,000-gallon tanks and after checking their fill gauges, they found that they were nearly full. There was also a tanker truck there, but it was empty. Shinji hooked the truck's filling hose up to the tanks, and began pumping it full of the gas. He was careful to make sure that the connections were secure and that no spark would ignite the fuel. It would likely take out a half-mile square if the holding tanks blew up.  
尽管他们并未找到真嗣所见的那辆 LP 卡车，但他们确实设法找到了为冈山及周边地区服务的 LP 加油站。这里有三个 20,000 加仑的储油罐，检查油量表后发现几乎已满。还有一辆油罐车，不过它是空的。真嗣将卡车的加油管连接到储油罐上，开始注入燃气。他小心翼翼地确保连接牢固，避免任何火花引燃燃料。如果储油罐爆炸，很可能会波及半径一英里的范围。

Once the truck was filled, he disconnected then waved to Asuka to signal that he was ready to go, then climbed in the cab of the truck and started it up, slowly following Asuka back into the mountains. The roads were good which made traveling easier. Since they had come here, they had taken the time to push the wrecked cars out of the way to make the roads more passable. It had only taken a day and a really big truck. Most of the burned out cars were just shoved to the side of the road.  
卡车加满油后，他断开连接，向明日香挥手示意准备出发，随后爬进卡车驾驶室启动引擎，缓缓跟随明日香驶回山区。道路状况良好，使得行程更加顺畅。自从他们来到这里，就花时间将损毁的车辆推到路边，以便道路更易通行。这仅用了一天时间和大卡车。大部分烧毁的车辆都被推到了路边。

It took about a half hour to get back to the house, then another half hour to fill up the tank and park the truck. Shinji threw a tarp over it so that when it did snow, the snow would not sit on the truck all winter. They had collected numerous tarps so that things would not be exposed during the snow, and they could be easily cleaned off.  
大约花了半小时才回到房子，然后又花了半小时给油箱加满油并停好卡车。真嗣用防水布盖住卡车，这样一旦下雪，雪就不会整个冬天都积在车上。他们收集了许多防水布，以便在雪天里保护物品不被暴露，并且可以轻松清理。

Once this was done, Shinji went inside to warm up his hands, and he retrieved a book on industrial electronics that he was using to wire up a huge uninterruptible power supply to the house. On the occasions the wind died down at the power turbines, they lost electricity. It did not last long, but it was getting increasingly annoying. S, they had spent some time searching for a UPS system that would be big enough to run the entire house, at least for a few hours. According to Asuka's figuring, this one would hold charge to run everything in the house for about 16 hours. They did not really use that much electricity, and the huge thing did hold one heck of a lot.  
完成这些后，真嗣进屋暖手，并取出一本关于工业电子的书，他正用这本书来为房子安装一个巨大的不间断电源。每当风力涡轮机的风力减弱时，他们就会断电。虽然时间不长，但越来越令人烦恼。因此，他们花了一些时间寻找一个足够大的 UPS 系统，至少能维持房子几个小时的供电。根据明日香的计算，这个系统可以储存足够的电量，让房子里的所有设备运行约 16 小时。他们实际上并没有使用那么多电，而这个巨大的设备确实能储存大量电能。

Unfortunately it was a special piece of equipment, and things like this generally don't come with instruction booklets. They are handled by professionals who know what they are doing. But the book he found helped him out a bit. Asuka was cutting insulation to line the water pipes with when he went outside.  
遗憾的是，这是一件特殊设备，通常这类东西不会附带说明书。它们由专业人士操作，这些人知道自己在做什么。不过他找到的那本书帮了他一点忙。当他走到外面时，明日香正在切割绝缘材料，准备包裹水管。

He cut power to the house at the transformer, and went to work, connecting the UPS to the main line in, and then feeding a line out to the breaker box in the house. It took nearly an hour, and when he was done, he called Asuka out, and together they flipped the breaker, and turned the UPS on. It took a moment before it started supplying power to the house. When it had charged enough, they would test it out. But that could wait until later.  
他在变压器处切断了房屋的电源，开始工作，将不间断电源（UPS）连接到主线上，然后从 UPS 引出一条线连接到屋内的断路器盒。这花了将近一个小时，完成后，他叫来明日香，两人一起合上断路器，启动了 UPS。过了一会儿，它开始向房屋供电。充电足够后，他们会进行测试。但那可以等到稍后再说。

It had taken a full day for them to get it up to the house. A full day, a big truck and a huge forklift to be exact. The UPS was a self contained light tan box about 15 feet long, 5 feet wide, and 6 feet tall. It now sat on a concrete shelf that barely managed completely support the system. It lacked just an inch from extending the full length under the unit. Fortunately the eaves of the house managed to cover a bit of it, and Shinji rigged a lean-to tarp over the rest of it extending out from the wall of the house. That would keep it out of the elements.  
他们花了整整一天时间才把它运到房子里。确切地说，是一整天、一辆大卡车和一台巨大的叉车。UPS 是一个自包含的浅棕色箱子，大约 15 英尺长，5 英尺宽，6 英尺高。现在它坐落在一块勉强能完全支撑系统的混凝土架子上，只差一英寸就能完全延伸到单元下方。幸运的是，屋檐能遮住一部分，而真嗣在房子外墙上搭了一个斜顶防水布，覆盖了其余部分。这样就能让它免受风雨侵袭。

While he was finishing this up, Asuka was heating some soup for lunch, and in a few moments he joined her for lunch. It had steadily been getting colder all day, and the clouds had darkened a bit too. It was only the beginning of October and it looked like it was threatening to unleash on them.  
当他完成这些工作时，明日香正在加热一些汤准备午餐，不久后他也加入了她。一整天天气都在逐渐变冷，云层也暗了一些。现在才十月初，看起来就要对他们发威了。

"I am kind of surprised how quickly it is starting. Only a few days ago it was hot. I hope that it doesn't get too bad." Asuka said as she slurped her soup.  
“我有点惊讶它开始得这么快。就在几天前还很热呢。希望不会太糟糕。”明日香一边喝着汤一边说道。

"Yeah. I think that the wood we have should be enough, plus we have the gas, the electricity, the clothes you have gotten together, and we have a lot of food. I think we will be alright. About the only thing we need to worry about now is cabin fever." Shinji munched on a cracker between spoonfuls of soup.  
“嗯，我觉得我们现有的木材应该足够了，再加上我们有煤气、电力、你收集的衣物，还有大量食物。我想我们会没事的。现在唯一需要担心的是幽居病。” 真嗣一边吃着饼干，一边喝着汤。

"I thought that was what we got the snow mobiles for. And if we can't get out on those there is always the sno-cat. I think we pretty much have everything covered. I only have a little more insulation to put on the pipes underneath, and that won't take but another hour." Asuka smiled at Shinji as he tried to lick a little splash of soup off of his cheek. It had been a lot of fun working with Shinji on this house. They accomplished a lot in only a short amount of time, but they had done it together, and with only a few complications between them. When she had told him earlier that she had slept well the night before she had not bee entirely truthful. She sat awake last night thinking about the boy.  
“我以为我们买雪地摩托就是为了这个。如果不能用它们出去，还有雪猫车呢。我觉得我们基本上都考虑到了。我只需要再给管道加一点隔热材料，这不会超过一个小时。” 明日香微笑着看向真嗣，他正试图舔掉脸颊上溅到的汤。和真嗣一起装修这房子很有趣。他们在短时间内完成了许多，而且是一起完成的，期间只遇到了几个小问题。她之前告诉他昨晚睡得很好，其实并不完全是真的。昨晚她醒着，想着这个男孩。

No. He was not a boy anymore. He had had a birthday a few months back and was now 15. But regardless of age, he was now the master of his own destiny. He was making his way in a hostile world, and he was responsible for his actions. He was a man. He was a good man, regardless of his deeds in the past. He still had spells of depression, but he was not nearly so bad as he was. He would just be more quiet than normal. She liked the man that he had become. He was smart, he was capable, and above all he was hers. She stopped at this thought. She had never reciprocated his profession of love. And yet she thought of him as hers. It struck a wrong cord in her. She really had no right to do that until she told him how she felt.  
不，他已不再是男孩。几个月前他刚过了生日，如今已满 15 岁。但不论年龄，他现在是自己命运的主宰。他正闯荡于一个充满敌意的世界，对自己的行为负责。他是个男人。无论过去的所作所为如何，他是个好人。他仍会经历抑郁的时刻，但已远不如从前那般严重。他只是比平时更沉默寡言。她喜欢他成长为的这个男人。他聪明、能干，最重要的是，他是她的。想到这里，她停了下来。她从未回应过他的爱意表白。然而，她却认为他是她的。这让她感到不妥。在她向他坦露心迹之前，她真的没有权利这样想。

She had come to the realization that she truly loved him only a few days ago, and she had really not meant to keep him waiting, but she had never found a way to broach the subject. He was surely agonizing over how long she was taking with this. Soon, soon she would tell him.  
直到几天前，她才意识到自己真的爱上了他，她并非有意让他等待，只是始终找不到合适的方式来提及这个话题。他肯定在为她的迟疑而痛苦。很快，很快她就会告诉他。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

She snapped back to reality, and realized that she had been staring with a spoonful of soup raised to her lips for more than a minute. Quickly she drank in the cold soup and resumed eating, blushing very slightly.  
她猛地回过神来，意识到自己已经举着一勺汤悬在唇边超过一分钟了。她迅速喝下那冷掉的汤，继续用餐，脸上微微泛起红晕。

"Asuka?" Shinji asked again.  
"明日香？" 真嗣再次问道。

"Um, yeah?" "呃，嗯？"

Shinji smiled because he knew she had not been paying attention. "I said I like your soup. It's good."  
真嗣笑了，因为他知道她刚才没在听。“我说我喜欢你的汤。很好喝。”

"It's nothing. All I did was heat it up."  
“没什么。我只是把它热了一下。”

"Well it is still good."  
“嗯，它依然很好喝。”

Asuka finished her soup without looking up again. When they were both done, Shinji put the dishes in the sink, and they went back to work. Asuka headed back down under the house to finish insulating the pipes while Shinji went back out to finish splitting and stacking the firewood. The work was good because it was easy, and it let him think. Sometimes he would split by hand. There was a double bladed axe in the toolshed that he used. It was soothing work. Mostly these days he thought about Asuka, but sometimes he thought about the people he had known.  
明日香没有再次抬头，默默地喝完了汤。两人都吃完后，真嗣把碗碟放进水槽，他们又回到了各自的工作中。明日香回到屋子下面继续给管道做保温，而真嗣则出去完成劈柴和堆放的工作。这份工作简单而美好，让他有时间思考。有时他会亲手劈柴，工具棚里有一把双刃斧，他用起来很顺手。这种劳作令人心安。这些日子里，他大多在想明日香，但偶尔也会想起那些他认识的人。

Rei. He missed her. Even if he had never had any more intimate interaction with her than speaking on an operational or philosophical level. There was a simple beauty in her that escaped him. It was unquantifiable. She had been the biggest enigma of his life. He assumed that if he had somehow been with Rei instead of Asuka, he could have fallen in love with her too. She was a stable pillar in the sea of chaotic tides that was the world.  
丽。他想念她。尽管他与她之间从未有过比操作或哲学层面更亲密的交流。她身上有一种简单的美，让他难以捉摸。这种美无法量化。丽是他生命中最大的谜团。他猜想，如果当初是和丽而不是明日香在一起，他也许也会爱上她。她就像那片混乱世界中的一根稳定支柱。

Misato. She was quite a woman. A slob and a role model at the same time. She had taken him into her house when he had been content to be alone, and even though he had been close to her all that time, she had never intentionally hurt him. She had her bad points, but all in all she was a beautiful person.  
美里。她真是个不简单的女人。既是个邋遢鬼，又是榜样。在他甘愿独处时，她收留了他；尽管与他亲近了那么久，她却从未有意伤害过他。她有缺点，但总的来说，她是个美好的人。

Gendo. Even though he had never been close to him, with the insight that was brought him by Third Impact, he at least understood him a little better. But his actions, while understandable could not be condoned. He did not hate his father, but he did pity him. He had allowed one bad event lead to countless others.  
源堂。尽管从未与他亲近，但第三次冲击带来的洞察力至少让他对他有了些许理解。然而，他的行为虽可理解却不能被宽恕。他不恨父亲，却怜悯他。他让一件坏事引发无数连锁反应。

Touji and Kensuke. He missed his friends dearly. They poked a little fun at him, but they both had hearts of gold, and would have stuck by him till the end. He had mourned their loss from the start. He had mourned all of them from the beginning. But the initial shock and denial, and the time for mourning were over. Now he had to get on with living, and salvage something out of his life. If he was with Asuka, he thought he could be happy. And indeed he had been.  
剑介和冬二。他深深怀念着这些朋友。他们偶尔会取笑他，但两人都有着金子般的心，会一直陪伴他到最后。从一开始，他就为他们的离去感到悲痛。他自始至终都在悼念他们。但最初的震惊与否认，以及哀悼的时间已经过去。现在他必须继续生活，从生命中挽回些什么。如果和明日香在一起，他想他会幸福。事实上，他也确实如此。

Asuka listened to the steady chunk sound of the wood being stacked outside. She resolved to tell him that night, but she was still at a loss for how she could do it. She was great at confrontations, why was this one so hard for her. She just wanted it to be meaningful for him. Something that would show him rather than tell him that she loved him.  
明日香听着外面木头堆叠的沉稳声响。她决心那晚告诉他，但仍不知如何开口。她向来擅长面对冲突，为何这次如此艰难。她只希望这件事对他来说意义深远。能让他感受到而非听到她对他的爱。

The long scar on her arm was still hard underneath but it had long ago stopped hurting. She remembered Shinji taking such care to do for her the best that he could in a difficult situation.  
她手臂上那道长长的疤痕虽已不再疼痛，但触感依旧坚硬。她记得真嗣在那艰难时刻尽其所能地细心照顾她。

She cursed herself for not wearing gloves. The fiberglass insulation was itching the hell out of her hands, and it was pissing her off! With the last pipe done, she crawled from under the house just as the first few flakes of snow were flitting down from above. Shinji was covering the wood having stacked the split pieces in a sizeable pile.  
她咒骂自己没戴手套。玻璃纤维绝缘材料让她的手痒得要命，这让她非常恼火！最后一根管子装好后，她从房子底下爬了出来，正好第一片雪花从上方飘落。真嗣正在覆盖木头，将劈好的木块堆成了一大堆。

He spied Asuka. "Not a moment too soon. Look at that." He said pointing.  
他瞥见了明日香。“来得正是时候。看那边。”他指着说道。

Asuka looking in the direction indicated, and she could not see the next mountain over. The snow was not coming, it was already here. They covered up the splitter, and walked inside where they watched the snow. Neither had seen snow up close before, and they found it kind of peaceful. Even more so than rain. Snow floated down, and softly touched down on the ground then a moment later it melted.  
明日香顺着所指的方向望去，却看不到远处的山峦。雪并非即将来临，而是已然降临。他们盖好分隔物，走进屋内，凝视着飘落的雪花。两人都未曾近距离见过雪，只觉得它比雨更宁静。雪花缓缓飘落，轻柔地触地，片刻后便融化了。

It was not long before the melting snow started to stick. By the time it began piling up it was getting dark. Here it was September and it was snowing like this. They both prayed that this was not an indication that it would last even longer next year. What would they do if the Earth turned to eternal winter?  
不久，融化的雪开始凝结。当积雪逐渐堆积时，天色也暗了下来。此时正值九月，却已如此大雪纷飞。两人祈祷这并非预示着明年会更漫长。若地球陷入永恒的寒冬，他们该如何是好？

Shinji spent some of the time cooking. They had liberated several pounds of butter that was sealed in its package, so they could bake and cook with it without fear of contamination. Shinji flipped through the cookbook, looking for a good idea for something to make. He stopped in the cookies.  
真嗣花了一些时间在烹饪上。他们已经取出了几磅密封包装的黄油，这样就可以放心地用来烘焙和烹饪，不用担心污染问题。真嗣翻阅着食谱，寻找一个好主意来制作些什么。他的目光停留在饼干那一页。

"Asuka, what do you think about Oatmeal cookies?" He looked up to see her turn to him smiling. God, he loved to see her smile.  
“明日香，你觉得燕麦饼干怎么样？”他抬头看到她转向他，脸上带着微笑。天啊，他喜欢看到她的笑容。

"That sounds good, can I help? I haven't ever made cookies before."  
“听起来不错，我能帮忙吗？我以前从来没做过饼干。”

"Sure! Come on over, and wash your hands." Shinji was busy getting ingredients out while she washed. Soon, Asuka was mixing things together while Shinji was checking the oven. They made the dough, and dropped it on the cookie sheets, and when they were safely inside the oven, he started the timer, and they shared a couple of cups of tea.  
"当然！过来吧，先洗洗手。" 真嗣忙着取出食材，而她则在洗手。不久，明日香开始搅拌材料，真嗣则检查烤箱。他们和好面团，将其放在烤盘上，待安全放入烤箱后，他启动了计时器，两人共享了几杯茶。

"You know that is kind of fun. The dough was a bit gooey, but otherwise it was cool." Asuka said taking a sip.  
"你知道这还挺有趣的。面团有点黏糊，但除此之外很酷。" 明日香说着，抿了一口茶。

"Yup. It is good to try something new, you might like it. I hope you like these cookies. I put in just a little more brown sugar than I normally do, they will be nice and sweet." Shinji yawned and looked out the window at the snow. It had snowed about 2 inches according to the pile on the porch.  
"是啊。尝试新事物挺好的，你可能会喜欢。希望你喜欢这些饼干。我比平时多放了一点红糖，它们会很香甜。" 真嗣打了个哈欠，望向窗外飘落的雪花。根据门廊上的积雪，大约下了两英寸。

Asuka nodded and looked outside too. It was very dark out, but she had grown used to this darkness. In the city there is always light around you, but out here, with no one else around, the darkness could be complete. They had found a pair of night vision goggles at an electronics and technology store. They were pretty new, and she had gazed up at the stars through them several times since. Through them you could see ten times the stars as even on the clearest night out here.  
明日香点点头，也向窗外望去。外面非常黑，但她已经习惯了这种黑暗。在城市里，总有灯光环绕着你，但在这里，四周无人，黑暗可以完全笼罩一切。他们在一家电子科技店里找到了一对夜视眼镜。它们相当新，自那以后她多次透过它们仰望星空。透过它们，你能看到的星星数量是在这里最晴朗的夜晚的十倍。

The timer dinged and they pulled the sheets out of the oven and let the cookies cool. They had made four dozen cookies, and when they were cool enough, taste tested a whole bunch of them just to make really sure they were fit to eat.  
计时器叮的一声响起，他们从烤箱中取出烤盘，让饼干冷却。他们一共做了四打饼干，等到足够凉了，就尝了好多块，确保它们适合食用。

With a couple of cookies each, they turned off all of the lights, and watched the snow together on the sofa. It was very quiet, and only the soft wind made any noise at all. The snowy world outside was muted and beautiful.  
每人吃了几块饼干后，他们关掉了所有的灯，一起坐在沙发上观赏雪景。四周非常安静，只有微风发出些许声响。外面的雪世界静谧而美丽。

Shinji was sitting very close to Asuka, and he found the circumstances on the whole very emotionally moving. He leaned on her, very slowly adding his weight. She knew what he was doing, but welcomed it. Was this what life was all about? Sharing beautiful moments like this with someone you love. Being able to recall things such as your first snow with your only love many years later? She hoped that this is what made life special because it felt special to her right now.  
真嗣紧挨着明日香坐着，他觉得整个情况都非常感人。他慢慢地靠在她身上，逐渐增加自己的重量。她知道他在做什么，但欣然接受。这就是生活的全部吗？与心爱的人共享这样美好的时刻。多年后，能否回忆起与唯一的爱人共度的初雪？她希望这就是让生活变得特别的原因，因为此刻对她来说确实很特别。

Shinji leaned closer and whispered in her ear. "I love you Asuka. It is getting late, so I am going to bed. I'll see you tomorrow." And then Asuka's chance was gone. It walked down the hallway and shut it's door behind it.  
真嗣靠得更近，在她耳边低语。“我爱你，明日香。天色已晚，我要去睡了。明天见。”随后，明日香的机会就这样溜走了。它沿着走廊走去，关上了身后的门。

She watched the snow alone for a half an hour. It continued to pile up on the porch. The hole in her heart ached so severely now. She had told herself that she would tell him, and yet she had let the opportunity pass her by, like so many before it. She longed to be with him, and then she had it.  
她独自看着雪下了半个小时。雪继续在门廊上堆积。她心中的空洞此刻痛得如此剧烈。她曾告诉自己要告诉他，然而她又一次让机会从身边溜走，就像之前的许多次一样。她渴望与他在一起，然后她意识到了这一点。

She stood and padded softly down the hallway, stopping in front of his door where she listened for a moment. The sound of his light snoring filled the room. The door squeaked a little as she opened it, so she did it quickly so that it would squeak as little as possible. She closed it the same way. She pulled off her socks and pants, and got in the sleeping bag with him. It was cooling off in the house, and she cuddled up to him, wrapping one arm around him.  
她站起身，轻轻地沿着走廊走去，停在门前倾听片刻。他的轻微鼾声充盈着房间。她迅速推开门，尽量减少吱嘎声。同样轻手轻脚地关上门。她脱下袜子和裤子，钻进睡袋与他同眠。屋内渐渐凉爽，她依偎过去，用一只手臂环抱住他。

She scooted up just a little to reach his ear, and whispered into his ear. "I love you too, Shinji. Sweet dreams." And then she went to sleep herself.  
她稍稍挪近，凑到他耳边，低语道：“我也爱你，真嗣。愿你有个好梦。”随后，她自己也进入了梦乡。

That night was most likely the best night of sleep either of them had ever had. They had each other, whether one of them knew it or not, and that was all that mattered.  
那一夜，很可能成为他们有生以来睡得最香甜的一晚。无论彼此是否意识到，他们拥有了对方，这便是全部的意义所在。

It snowed through the night but the occupants of the bedroom were oblivious. Shinji woke up an hour or two after midnight. He had originally woken up because he had to go to the bathroom, but he found that he couldn't move. A certain redheaded roommate was latched onto him from behind, and from the soft feel of the leg wrapped over his, she was missing a crucial article of clothing.  
雪整夜未停，但卧室里的居民们却浑然不觉。真嗣在午夜后一两个小时醒来。他原本是因为需要上厕所而醒来，却发现动弹不得。一位红发的室友从背后紧紧抱住他，从那条缠在他身上的腿的柔软触感来看，她少了一件关键的衣物。

One of her arms snaked under the pillow, and wrapped around his chest, the other wound over his other side, and her hand rested at the base of his stomach, dangerously close to a provocative area indeed.  
她的一条手臂从枕头下悄悄探出，环抱住他的胸膛，另一只手则绕过他的另一侧，轻轻搭在他腹部的根部，距离某个挑逗的区域仅一步之遥。

It was not hot in the room, in fact it was getting pretty cool, and Shinji was sweating. What had happened? He had gone to sleep alone. Asuka had come in sometime in the night and come to bed with him. Perhaps she had made her decision and figured this was the best way to say it. Maybe she had stayed up really late and had just gotten rooms mixed up. Maybe it was too cold to sleep alone.  
房间里并不热，实际上还挺凉快的，但真嗣却在出汗。发生了什么？他原本是独自入睡的。夜里不知何时，明日香走了进来，和他同床共枕。也许她已经做出了决定，认为这是表达的最佳方式。或许她熬夜到很晚，只是走错了房间。又或许，一个人睡实在太冷了。

Whatever the reason, she was in his bed, and she was pressed up against him, and it felt really good. He slowly turned, easing himself slowly out of the sleeping bag. He went to the bathroom and was back quickly. Slipping back into the bag, he snuggled up to her, facing her, and nuzzling his nose into her neck. She was warm and just the feel of her next to him made him feel better about everything around him. For the first time in the last two months, he fell back to sleep after waking up in only a matter of minutes instead of hours.  
无论原因如何，她现在就在他的床上，紧贴着他，那种感觉真的很美好。他缓缓转身，小心翼翼地从睡袋中抽身。他去了洗手间，很快就回来了。重新钻回睡袋，他依偎向她，面对着她，将鼻子埋进她的颈间。她的温暖，以及她紧贴着他的感觉，让他对周围的一切都感到更加安心。在过去的两个月里，他第一次在醒来几分钟后，而不是几小时，再次沉沉睡去。

The snow continued to fall until nearly 4:00 AM. It had piled up on the porch high enough to make exiting the house a little difficult to manage without letting snow spill into the house. The outside landscape took on a much more smooth appearance, distorted by the thick three foot covering of the white powder.  
雪一直下到将近凌晨四点。它堆积在门廊上，高得让出门变得有些困难，不注意就会让雪洒进屋里。外面的景色也因此变得更为平滑，被厚达三英尺的白色粉末所扭曲。

Asuka awoke first that morning. She watched her companion resting easily beside her. He was not smiling, but she could tell that he was happy in his sleep. After a while, his eyes slowly made their way open, and he looked into hers. He smiled at her then, and even without words so much was expressed between them.  
那天早上，明日香最先醒来。她看着身旁的同伴安然入睡。他没有微笑，但她能感觉到他在梦中是快乐的。过了一会儿，他的眼睛缓缓睁开，与她的目光相遇。他随即向她微笑，尽管没有言语，他们之间却表达了太多。

Shinji knew then that she indeed did love him. The wait had been worth it, and he was not disappointed. Here he was waking up for the first time next to the woman that he loved, embracing her in his sleep. They held each other for long time, changing around every now and then when limbs fell asleep.  
那一刻，真嗣知道她确实爱他。等待是值得的，他并未失望。他第一次在心爱的女人身边醒来，在睡梦中拥抱着她。他们长时间地相拥，偶尔变换姿势，以免肢体麻木。

Finally Asuka couldn't take it anymore, and she caught Shinji off guard, kissing him. It was not the fearsome kiss that they had shared some months before, but soft and inviting. Shinji found that the previous attempt at kissing had not really prepared him for that real thing. Asuka had a taste about her that he could not describe. And something as simple as her tongue sliding past his produced a sensation that felt so wonderful. He didn't know how long they kissed, but he did know that it was very arousing, and soon Asuka noticed too.  
终于，明日香再也忍不住了，她趁真嗣不备，吻了他。这并非几个月前那个令人畏惧的吻，而是温柔且诱人。真嗣发现，之前的尝试并未真正让他准备好迎接这一刻。明日香的味道，他难以言表。仅仅是她的舌头轻轻滑过他的，就带来了一种美妙的感觉。他不知道他们吻了多久，但他知道这非常令人兴奋，很快明日香也察觉到了。

Surprised she pulled away a little, and put her hand on his chest. "Hey now, what's going on down there." She could joke about it a little, but the prospect of sex still did not ring right with her. She was not sure if she was ready for something like that. "I don't really think it would be a good idea to get ahead of ourselves Shinji. Let's take it slow and be a little careful, huh?"  
她惊讶地稍稍退开，手放在他的胸口。“嘿，下面怎么回事。”她能开个小玩笑，但性这件事对她来说仍不合适。她不确定自己是否准备好面对这样的事。“我觉得我们还是别太急进，真嗣。慢慢来，小心点，好吗？”

Shinji visibly relaxed at this. He was worried that by going too quickly, pushing the relationship along, they would inadvertently cheapen the feelings involved. He liked it this way. He could enjoy it and savor it.  
听到这话，真嗣明显放松了。他担心如果进展太快，推动这段关系，会无意中贬低了其中的情感。他喜欢这样。他可以享受并细细品味。

"But just cause we aren't having sex, that doesn't mean we can't be fooling around!" Asuka grinned evilly at him, and kissed him again. "Oh, man, we had better get up. It is getting late. Besides I am pretty hungry, how about you?"  
"但就算我们不做爱，也不代表我们不能调情啊！" 明日香邪恶地对他笑着，再次吻了他。"哦，伙计，我们最好起床了。天色不早了。而且我真的很饿，你呢？"

Shinji's stomach growled in answer. He looked at her, memorizing her look and feel. She was beautiful like this. Unadorned and unrefined. She had a rumpled shirt, and semi-wild hair, but there was a smile on her face, and warmth in her heart.  
真嗣的肚子咕噜作响以作回应。他看着她，记住她的样子和感觉。她这样很美。不加修饰，自然质朴。她穿着皱巴巴的衬衫，头发半乱，但脸上挂着笑容，心中充满温暖。

They got up then, Shinji watching Asuka as she wandered to the bathroom. He dressed in clean clothes as she washed up. When he went into the living room, he was amazed to find the huge snowfall outside. They would have to rig something up so that future snowfalls did not pile up against the door.  
他们随后起床，真嗣看着明日香走进浴室。他穿上干净的衣服，而她在洗漱。当他走进客厅时，惊讶地发现外面下着大雪。他们得想个办法，以免未来的积雪堵住门口。

He heard the water run a few seconds in the bathroom, then Asuka went to her room to retrieve clothes of her own. He looked through the kitchen and decided to have oatmeal for breakfast that morning. It was easy, fast, there was lots of it, and it kept well. Plus it was filling. He put some water on to boil but did not turn on the stove and readied some bread in the toaster.  
他听到浴室里水流了几秒钟，随后明日香去她房间拿自己的衣服。他在厨房里转了一圈，决定那天早上吃燕麦片当早餐。这既简单又快捷，量也足，还容易保存。而且很顶饱。他放了些水准备烧开，但没有打开炉子，而是准备了一些面包放进烤面包机。

Asuka appeared, brushing her hair. She hit a few snags, but soon had it flowing in long red tresses again. "Wow. Looks like we aren't going to get much done outside today."  
明日香出现了，正在梳头。她遇到了几个打结的地方，但很快又让那头长长的红发顺滑地垂落下来。“哇，看来我们今天在外面干不了多少活了。”

"Yeah, I was thinking that myself, although I need to go out to the chicken house in a few minutes. It might be getting a little cool in there now, so I was going to put an electric heater in there."  
“是啊，我自己也是这么想的，不过我过会儿得去鸡舍一趟。现在那里可能有点冷了，所以我打算放个电暖器进去。”

"Better put something around it like some wire or something. Those stupid chickens will burn themselves to death on that thing. By the way, you want to try going down to the hot spring with me? It might start out cold, but I bet it will be worth it."  
"最好在上面缠些铁丝什么的。那些笨鸡会把自己活活烧死在那东西上的。对了，你想和我一起去温泉吗？一开始可能会有点冷，但我敢说绝对值得一试。"

Shinji thought about it for a second. He had seen Asuka venturing down to the hot spring several times a week. She would spend an hour or more down there, soaking up the warm water. "Sure. I would love to. Should I wear my bathing suit?" He was still a little unsure around her. Would she want him naked? Would she be naked herself?  
真嗣想了一会儿。他见过明日香每周几次去温泉。她会在那里泡上一个多小时，享受温暖的水。“当然，我很愿意去。我应该穿泳衣吗？”他还是有点不确定她的想法。她会希望他裸体吗？她自己会裸体吗？

"Well, if you really want to. I wasn't planning on you wearing it." She grinned at him again.  
"嗯，如果你真的想穿的话。我本来没打算让你穿。"她再次对他咧嘴一笑。

"But I thought we were going to hold off on... you know... sex." It was a difficult idea for him to get used to. He had never been close to anyone before so the idea of sex was foreign to him. At one point he had even been convinced that he would never meet the expectations of any girl, and he would be destined to be alone. He would have to visit a soapland or something if he wanted intimate contact. He felt the blush creeping into his face.  
“但我想我们不是要推迟……你知道的……性。”这对他来说是个难以适应的想法。他从未与任何人亲近过，所以性的概念对他来说是陌生的。曾经有一段时间，他甚至确信自己永远无法满足任何女孩的期望，注定要孤独一生。如果他想有亲密接触，可能得去泡泡浴之类的地方。他感到脸颊渐渐泛起红晕。

"Yeah so? Just cause were naked, doesn't mean we're having sex, Shinji." The grin turned devious.  
“是啊，那又怎样？只是因为我们赤裸着，并不意味着我们在做爱，真嗣。”她的笑容变得狡黠。

Shinji had to turn away to keep Asuka from seeing how red he was at that thought. She knew exactly how embarrassing that was, but she did not need to see. "I think I am going to go take care of those chickens."  
真嗣不得不转过身去，不让明日香看到他因为那个想法而涨红的脸。她完全知道那有多尴尬，但她不需要亲眼看到。“我想我要去照顾那些鸡了。”

Asuka turned him around, and planted another kiss on him, then let him go. "Can you cook the oatmeal while I am out? I will be right back." He spent a few minutes bundling up and getting gloves and tall boots on then went to the door. It was a five minute battle with the snow to get out. First the door wouldn't open, and then there was an ice crusted wall of snow that barred his way. He managed to step over it, and get outside before starting his assault on the pile. He cleared most of it away so that you could open and close the door well enough and step outside without too much trouble.  
明日香将他转过身，又在他唇上印下一吻，随后放开了他。“我去去就回，你能先煮点燕麦粥吗？”他花了些时间裹紧衣服，戴上手套和长靴，然后走向门口。门外积雪重重，他费了五分钟才艰难地打开门。先是门打不开，接着又有一堵冰封的雪墙挡住了去路。他好不容易跨过雪墙，踏出屋外，开始清理积雪。他清除了大部分雪，确保门可以顺畅开关，出门也不再那么困难。

From there he got under the house and located the space heater they had stored down there. It had been in the shed to begin with, but they took it out to make space. There was also some chicken wire. He took the stuff over to the shed and set it inside then went to the other for the wire cutters he would need.  
接着，他钻到房子下面，找到了他们存放在那里的空间加热器。这原本放在棚子里，但他们为了腾出空间将其移了出来。那里还有一些铁丝网。他把这些东西搬到棚子里放好，然后去另一个棚子找他需要的铁丝剪。

Back inside the chicken shed, he setup the electric heater and surrounded it with the wire, then cut a piece out and crimped it over the top so that they would not sit on top of the heater. He set it on a low setting, which should keep them warm enough then collected the eggs for the day.  
回到鸡舍内，他安装好电暖器，并用铁丝网将其围住，然后剪下一截铁丝，将其压紧在加热器顶部，以防它们直接坐在上面。他将加热器调至低温，这样应该足够保暖，然后开始收集当天的鸡蛋。  
He put the wire cutters back in their place then headed for the house, stomping his feet off before entering. Asuka was stirring the oatmeal just as he walked in. The smell was delicious.  
他把钢丝钳放回原位，然后朝房子走去，在进门之前跺了跺脚。阿斯卡正在搅拌燕麦粥，他一进门就闻到了诱人的香味。

"What all you got in there?" It was a nice medium brown.  
“你都放了些什么？”颜色是漂亮的棕褐色。

"Brown sugar, sugar and some butter. That is the way I always liked it made for me back home."  
“红糖、白糖和一些黄油。这是我以前在家时最喜欢的做法。”

The toast popped up, and they sat down with it all to eat. About halfway through the meal, Asuka was startled by a foot nudging her calf. Shinji was playing footsie. She looked over at him, and he wrinkled his nose and smiled.  
吐司弹了出来，他们坐下准备享用。吃到一半时，明日香被一只脚轻轻碰了碰小腿，是真嗣在玩脚尖游戏。她转头看向他，他皱了皱鼻子，笑了。

"Oh, I see what's going on here. " She reached under the table far enough to squeeze his knee. Shinji erupted in a fit of laughter as his leg jumped and his knee threatened to upset the table. Only a few more such exchanges later, they were done with breakfast washing the dishes.  
“哦，我明白了。”她伸手到桌子下，足够远地捏了捏他的膝盖。真嗣爆发出一阵大笑，他的腿跳了起来，膝盖差点掀翻桌子。又经过几次这样的互动，他们终于吃完了早餐，开始洗碗。

"It's a good thing you insulated the pipes, Asuka. Otherwise we would be out of luck for water I bet." Shinji dried oft the last of the dishes, while Asuka looked proud of herself.  
“幸好你给管道做了保温，明日香。不然我猜我们就要没水用了。”真嗣擦干了最后一个盘子，而明日香则自豪地看着自己的成果。

"Thanks, Shinji, I was kinda hoping it would work out. We might want to leave a faucet dripping a little to keep it flowing."  
"谢谢，真嗣，我有点希望它能奏效。我们可能需要让水龙头滴点水，保持流动。"

"OK." Shinji picked up a cookbook, and thumbed through the pages. After a couple of minutes, he turned to the deserts and started leafing through them instead of regular meals.  
"好的。" 真嗣拿起一本食谱，翻阅着页面。几分钟后，他转向甜点部分，开始浏览，而不是常规餐食。

"Hey, good looking. Whatcha got cookin?" Asuka looked over his shoulder as he flipped page after page.  
"嘿，帅哥。你在做什么好吃的？" 明日香从他肩后看过去，他一页页地翻着。

"Just looking to see what might be good. How about this?" He pointed to a page. It was Hungarian Coffee Cake.  
"只是想看看有什么好吃的。这个怎么样？" 他指向一页。那是匈牙利咖啡蛋糕。

"That looks good but kinda strange. What is it?"  
"看起来不错，但有点奇怪。这是什么？"

"Well it is sweet dough rolled into little balls. Then they are dipped in melted butter and covered in sugar, brown sugar, and pecans. I think that I saw a bag of store bought pecans in the pantry. Anyhow, the balls of dough are put in a Bundt pan and they bake together. When it is done, you pull them off to eat them."  
"嗯，这是甜面团做成的小球。然后它们被浸在融化的黄油里，裹上糖、红糖和山核桃。我想我在食品储藏室看到了一袋商店买的山核桃。总之，这些面团球放在一个长条形烤盘里一起烤。烤好后，你就可以把它们掰下来吃。"

"That sounds good, can you make that?" Asuka's mouth watered at the sight of the picture.  
"听起来不错，你能做出来吗？" 看到那张图片，明日香不禁垂涎欲滴。

"Yup I'm sure I can. I have never made one before, but I can cook pretty well I think."  
"当然，我相信我能行。虽然我以前没做过，但我觉得自己厨艺还不错。"

"Can I help?" She looked at him with hopeful eyes.  
"我能帮忙吗？" 她满怀希望地看着他。

"Sure! Let me get everything together before we start." Asuka stood back as Shinji went to work gathering ingredients. It was a sizeable list, but fortunately they had stocked up on staple items a few days before, if they hadn't they would be dangerously close to running out of a few things by making the cake.  
“当然！让我先把所有东西准备好，我们再开始。” 真嗣开始收集食材时，明日香退到一旁。清单上的东西不少，但幸运的是他们几天前刚补充了基本物品，否则做这个蛋糕可能会让他们陷入某些必需品告罄的危险境地。

He took a mixing bowl out and they started making the dough together. Shinji took the amorphous mass and covering the bowl with plastic wrap he placed it in the warmed oven to rise.  
他拿出一个搅拌碗，两人一起开始制作面团。真嗣接过那团不成形的面团，用保鲜膜覆盖碗口后，将其放入预热好的烤箱中发酵。

"OK, now if you would take this pan and melt the butter over there, it should make quite a bit. Do it slowly and don't let it boil. I am going to chop these pecans and mix the sugars." He handed her an aluminum pan and set to work chopping the nuts. Once he had about a half cup, then he mixed the sugars and added a little cinnamon. Asuka was pouring the melted butter into a bowl.  
“好，现在请你拿这个平底锅在那边慢慢融化黄油，应该会融化不少。注意不要让它沸腾。我要来切这些山核桃并混合糖。” 他递给她一个铝制平底锅，然后开始切坚果。大约切了半杯后，他将糖混合并加入了一点肉桂。明日香正将融化的黄油倒入一个碗中。

When all was ready Shinji greased a bunt pan. They waited a few more minutes, and then he checked on the dough. It had nearly doubled in size, so he took it out, punched it down, and brought it over to the table.  
一切准备就绪后，真嗣给一个烤盘涂上了油。他们又等了几分钟，然后他检查了面团。它几乎膨胀了一倍，于是他将其取出，压扁，并拿到桌子上。

"OK, ready to get your fingers dirty? You get the fun part."  
“好了，准备好弄脏你的手了吗？轮到你享受乐趣了。”

Asuka nodded with a broad smile on her face, and sat down at the table.  
明日香带着灿烂的笑容点点头，坐在了桌子旁。

"Alright. I am going to make this into little balls then dip them in the butter then drop them in the sugar. You roll it in the sugar and the nuts then put it in the Bundt pan. Best to try and make several rows of them before starting to stack them in there."  
“好的。我要把这些做成小球，然后蘸上黄油，再滚上糖。你把它们在糖和坚果里滚一滚，然后放进烤盘里。最好先试着做几排，然后再开始堆叠。”

They started the assembly line production of the balls of dough. It took only about 10 minutes to fill the Bundt pan. Shinji took the remaining butter, and drizzled it on top of the topmost layer of dough, then sprinkled the rest of the sugar and nuts over that. He set the pan back in the oven to let the dough rise again.  
他们开始流水线式地制作面团球。只用了大约 10 分钟就填满了烤盘。真嗣拿起剩下的黄油，淋在最上层的面团上，然后撒上剩下的糖和坚果。他把烤盘放回烤箱，让面团再次发酵。

After they washed their hands, he sat back down next to her and put his arm around her. He had still not heard the words he had longed to hear from her. "I love you, Asuka."  
洗完手后，他重新坐回她身边，搂住她。他仍然没有听到他渴望从她口中听到的那句话。“我爱你，明日香。”

She froze. Three little words were all it was, but they had so much meaning about them. For several days now she had known that she loved him too, but those words were still hard for her to say. She leaned close and whispered as though she did not want anyone else to hear. "I love you too, Shinji." And then she kissed him again.  
她僵住了。虽然只是短短的三个字，却蕴含着深意。这几天来，她早已明白自己也爱着他，但说出这些话依然艰难。她靠近他，低声细语，仿佛不想让任何人听见。“我也爱你，真嗣。”随后，她再次吻了他。

Shinji was starting to like this being intimate thing. Every time he kissed her it was like he was floating ten feet above. She was intoxicating to him, and it was a thrill he was sorry he had never known before. They made out at the kitchen table for a little while, even going so far as to let their hands wander, but not too far. The bell on the oven dinged, and Shinji pulled back for some air.  
真嗣开始喜欢上这种亲密的感觉。每次亲吻她，都像是飘在十英尺高的空中。她对他来说极具诱惑力，这种刺激是他之前未曾体验过的，让他感到遗憾。他们在厨房的桌子上亲热了一会儿，甚至让双手也游走起来，但并未太过分。烤箱的铃声响起，真嗣退开喘了口气。

"Got... to take the. dough out. Heat the oven, and let it bake."  
“得...把面团拿出来。预热烤箱，然后让它烤。”

"You just wait a second there, mister." She pinched his side, and gave him another kiss, slapping his butt as he walked away.  
"你就在那儿等着，先生。" 她掐了一下他的腰，又给了他一个吻，在他走开时还拍了一下他的屁股。

Shinji pulled the pan from the oven, then heated it to 450 degrees. He put the pan in and let it bake for 20 minutes and sat back down while giving Asuka an impromptu shoulder massage.  
真嗣从烤箱里拿出平底锅，然后加热到 450 度。他把锅放进去，让它烤 20 分钟，然后坐下来，顺便给明日香做了一个即兴的肩部按摩。

"You know, Shinji, I think I am going to put you on full time, even give you a raise. That feels so gooood." Shinji kneaded knots out of her muscles, and hit pressure points that hurt for an instant, then felt wonderful afterwards. All too soon, the bell dinged again, and he rushed over to pull the cake out of the oven.  
"你知道吗，真嗣，我想我会让你全职工作，甚至给你加薪。这感觉太棒了。" 真嗣揉开了她肌肉中的结，按到了一些瞬间疼痛后感觉美妙的压力点。铃声再次响起，他急忙过去把蛋糕从烤箱里拿出来。

It sizzled as it continued to cook while cooling down. The dark brown crusty texture of the outside belied the soft bready inside. Shinji let it cool for about 5 minutes, then put a small cutting board over the top of the pan, and turned them upside down, letting the cake sink onto the board. With the pan in the sink, he went around cleaning up what was left of the mess, while Asuka watched the cake cool.  
它在冷却的同时继续烹煮，发出嘶嘶声。外层的深棕色硬壳掩盖了内部的柔软面包质地。真嗣让它冷却了大约 5 分钟，然后将一个小切菜板放在平底锅上方，翻转过来，让蛋糕落在板上。他拿着锅去水槽清洗剩下的杂乱，而明日香则看着蛋糕冷却。

"It should be just about right now, take a piece, try it."  
“现在应该正好，拿一块，尝尝看。”

She pulled a piece off, and bit into it. It was ooey gooey heaven. And the outside was crusty and crunchy. "Oh, my god, that is soooo good. Shinji you got to try this."  
她撕下一块，咬了一口。那是黏糊糊的天堂。外层又脆又硬。“哦，我的天，太好吃了。真嗣，你得试试这个。”

Shinji tested a piece too and thought it was great too. They ate nearly a quarter of the cake before they knew what happened, and Shinji exercised great self control, covering the cake, and shielding it from further Asuka pickings.  
真嗣也尝了一块，同样觉得非常美味。他们不知不觉间几乎吃掉了四分之一的蛋糕，真嗣展现出了极大的自制力，将蛋糕盖好，并保护它免受明日香进一步的“掠夺”。

"Want to go down to the hotspring, now?" Shinji asked. It was still just a little daunting. So far as he knew she had never seen him naked. Unless she had peeked during their nude synch test.  
“现在想去泡温泉吗？”真嗣问道，这仍让他略感紧张。就他所知，她从未见过他裸体。除非她在他们的裸体同步测试时偷看过。

"Yeah! Lets take the snow mobile down there. That is a bit far to be trudging through that deep snow."  
“好啊！我们开雪地摩托去那儿吧。那么远的路，在那么深的雪里跋涉可不容易。”

They packed up a couple of towels and sponges and soap, put some clean clothes in there, and added a hot water bottle in the middle of them to keep them warm. Then they bundled up a bit, and headed outside.  
他们收拾了几条毛巾、海绵和肥皂，放了些干净衣服进去，还在中间塞了个热水袋保暖。然后他们稍微裹紧了些，便出门了。

The snowmobile was parked next to the garage, covered with a tarp. On their way there they picked up another tarp to put their clothes on and just have a fairly even ground without snow on it to change on when they got out of the water. It was likely to be really cold, but that was the price to pay for the heaven that was the hot spring.  
雪地摩托停在车库旁，盖着防水布。去那儿的路上，他们又捡了一块防水布，打算用来铺衣服，这样出水时就能有个没有雪的平坦地面换衣服。虽然可能会非常冷，但这是享受温泉天堂不得不付出的代价。

The ride down was uneventful. Shinji was a quick learner with vehicles these days, and it only took a few feet of driving the machine before he had it down pretty well. They parked not far from the shore, then walked over and set the tarp down. There was actually no snow for several feet leading up to the water. The water was warm enough to heat the ground and keep it from sticking.  
下山的路上一切顺利。最近，真嗣对驾驶交通工具学得很快，没开几英尺就基本掌握了。他们在离岸不远处停下，然后走过去铺好防水布。实际上，离水边几英尺内都没有雪。水温足够温暖，能加热地面，防止积雪。

Asuka began undressing right away. Shinji averted his eyes just before Asuka pulled her shirt off, but was relieved to find that she was wearing a swimsuit, albeit a skimpy bikini. She finished undressing before he was halfway through, and took the liquid soap and scrubber with her to the concrete seat. Shinji pulled off his clothes, in no real hurry other than to get out of the cold. He had a pair of swim trunks on that would cover at least a little of him. Asuka was sitting in the water with only the top half of her head above the surface.  
明日香立刻开始脱衣服。真嗣在她脱掉衬衫前迅速移开了视线，但松了一口气地发现她穿着泳衣，尽管是一件暴露的比基尼。她在他还没脱到一半时就换好了衣服，拿着沐浴露和搓澡巾走向水泥座位。真嗣脱下衣服，除了想摆脱寒冷并没有特别着急。他穿着一条泳裤，至少能遮住一部分身体。明日香坐在水里，只有上半个头露出水面。

Shinji gingerly lowered himself into the hot water. Asuka was being quiet, but at least she was smiling. He could live on that smile alone. No sleep, no food, no water. Just that smile. Come to think of it the smile was less a happy smile and more a devious smile.  
真嗣小心翼翼地将自己浸入热水中。明日香很安静，但至少她在微笑。他可以仅凭那个微笑活下去。不需要睡眠，不需要食物，不需要水。只要有那个微笑。仔细想想，那个微笑与其说是快乐的微笑，不如说是一种狡黠的微笑。

Asuka reached over and grabbed Shinji's hand, pulling it over to her. Where he expected to feel the fabric of her swimsuit, instead he found soft silky smooth skin, curving towards her body on all sides. Shocked, but curious, he let her guide his hand, stroking it down her body passing over her navel. As it continued further south, he tried pulling away, but her grip was surprisingly tight. Or was it that he was only pulling half-heartedly?  
明日香伸出手，抓住了真嗣的手，拉向自己。他本以为会触到她泳衣的布料，却意外地感受到了柔软光滑的肌肤，四周向她的身体曲线延伸。震惊之余，他带着好奇心任由她引导他的手，沿着她的身体轻抚，经过她的肚脐。当手继续向南移动时，他试图抽回，但她的握力出奇地紧。还是说，他只是半心半意地拉扯？

Either way at the hint of a few soft curled hairs, he managed to regain control of his hand. He pulled it back to him, rubbing his fingers against his palm. He could still almost feel the skin beneath his touch. He looked to Asuka who was looking at him, her smile gone.  
无论如何，在触及几缕柔软卷曲的毛发时，他设法重新控制了自己的手。他将手抽回，揉搓着掌心。他几乎还能感觉到那肌肤在他指尖下的触感。他看向明日香，她正注视着他，笑容已消失。

"I. I'm sorry Shinji, I just wanted to have a little fun, you know? No funny business, just some fiddling around."  
“我……对不起，真嗣，我只是想找点乐子，你知道吗？没有别的意思，只是随便玩玩。”

"Asuka, I just don't want something like that to lead to sex. I want my first time to be romantic and nice. Playing around is fine later, but I want to be serious for a while, OK?" Shinji knew that Asuka wanted to have sex. She was a normal teenage girl, and her hormones were raging just as well as his were.  
“明日香，我只是不想因为那样的事情导致发生关系。我希望我的第一次是浪漫而美好的。以后玩玩可以，但我想先认真一段时间，好吗？” 真嗣知道明日香想要发生性关系。她是个正常的青春期女孩，她的荷尔蒙和他一样在狂飙。

She scooted closer to him, and laid her head on his shoulder. "OK. I didn't mean to upset you. Can I still wash you, though?"  
她向他挪近了一些，把头靠在他的肩膀上。“好吧。我不是有意让你难过的。不过，我还能帮你洗澡吗？”

Shinji saw that one coming. But what was the harm in it right? He was on to her now, he could stop it if it went too far. "Yeah I guess. You really want to?"  
真嗣预料到了这一点。但这样做有什么害处呢？他现在对她有所提防了，如果事情发展得太远，他可以阻止。“嗯，我想可以。你真的想吗？”

"Sure why not? If I wash you, will you wash me?" She was smiling again.  
“当然可以，为什么不呢？如果我帮你洗，你会帮我洗吗？”她又露出了笑容。

Shinji thought about that one. It was one thing to allow her to wash him. But he would be touching her. Of course he had been only feeling like this for so long. Now he needed to start acting on them. To date he had never touched a girl intimately, even to wash her, with exception of a few seconds ago and that one morning in Rei's apartment. That was a distant memory.  
真嗣思考了一下。允许她帮他洗澡是一回事，但他会触碰到她。当然，他一直有这样的感觉。现在他需要开始付诸行动。迄今为止，他从未与女孩亲密接触过，即使是帮她洗澡，除了刚才那几秒钟和在丽公寓的那个早晨。那已经是很遥远的记忆了。

"OK."

Asuka frowned, but said nothing. Shinji was starting to be melancholy again. "Shinji I know that you may not really like this, but I want to be close to you and you are not making it easy for me." She paused for a moment looking at Shinji. He was just about to say something when "And don't say you are sorry. You can make it up to me by being enthusiastic about this whole thing."  
明日香皱了皱眉，但没有说话。真嗣又开始变得忧郁了。“真嗣，我知道你可能不太喜欢这样，但我想要靠近你，而你并没有让我容易做到。”她停顿了一下，看着真嗣。他正要开口说什么，她接着说：“而且别说对不起。你可以通过对此事热情一点来弥补我。”

Asuka stood on the platform, rising out of the water. The clouds had started thinning out and the sun came out a few minutes before so the light shone off of her wet body. Shinji thought she was beautiful. She sat down on the step, handing the soap and scrubber to him. "There you go."  
明日香站在平台上，从水中升起。云层开始散开，太阳几分钟前露出了脸，阳光洒在她湿润的身体上。真嗣觉得她美极了。她坐在台阶上，将肥皂和搓澡巾递给他。“给你。”

The scrubber was made out of lufa gourd that had been sewn onto a towel like rectangle of cloth. You could slip your hand into it to make it easier to wash. Shinji sat behind the girl and soaped up the scrub glove. He gazed at her skin. It was smooth and soft looking, and he could see the steam rising off of it in places. She hunched her shoulders forward, presenting him with more back to wash.  
搓澡巾是用丝瓜络缝在类似毛巾的布片上制成的。你可以把手伸进去，这样洗起来更方便。真嗣坐在女孩身后，给搓澡手套涂上肥皂。他凝视着她的肌肤，光滑柔软，有些地方还能看到蒸汽升腾。她微微耸肩，将更多的背部展示给他清洗。

He washed back and forth all down the back. Asuka obviously liked it either from the scratching or just the feeling of being touched like that. He took each arm and washed down the length of it, being careful not to irritate the long scar on her left arm.  
他沿着背部上下搓洗。明日香显然很喜欢这种感觉，无论是搓洗的摩擦还是仅仅因为被这样触碰。他拿起她的每只手臂，仔细地从上到下清洗，小心避开她左臂上的长疤痕。

His hands slid around her front, washing over her breasts. They were small and firm, and he chastised himself for enjoying it. Asuka turned her head and saw him out the corner of her eyes. She could tell that he was smiling, and she moved her head back to rub the side of her face against his. It felt good to have someone touch her that way. Someone that she could trust and love, and who would love her in return. She felt sorry for putting the boy in a position that would make him feel bad. She had manipulated this situation to her own gain, that of a little petting, and had made him more insecure about what was going on.  
他的双手滑到她的前方，轻抚过她的胸部。它们小巧而坚实，他责备自己竟享受其中。明日香转过头，用眼角余光瞥见了他。她能看出他在微笑，便将头转回，用脸颊轻轻蹭着他的侧脸。有人这样触碰她，感觉很好。一个她可以信任和爱的人，也会以爱回应她的人。她为自己让这男孩陷入令他感到不适的境地而感到抱歉。她利用了这个局面为自己谋取了些许抚慰，却让他对正在发生的事情更加不安。

She placed her hands over his, and stopped him from washing. She was covered in white soap suds, and while it had felt wonderful, she wanted Shinji to feel at ease. Maybe some soothing words. "Shinji. Mmmmm. That felt great."  
她将手放在他的手上，阻止了他继续清洗。她全身覆盖着白色的肥皂泡沫，虽然感觉很美妙，但她希望让真嗣感到自在。或许几句安抚的话语会有所帮助。“真嗣。嗯……那感觉真好。”

"I am glad you liked it Asuka. Are you sure you want to wash me? I mean."  
“我很高兴你喜欢，明日香。你确定要帮我洗吗？我是说……”

"If you don't want me to that is fine." She felt Shinji nod his head, and considered the matter settled. Shinji hugged her from behind, and listened to her breathing.  
“如果你不希望我这么做，那也没关系。”她感觉到真嗣点了点头，便认为这件事已经解决了。真嗣从背后抱住她，聆听着她的呼吸。

They stayed like this for several minutes, then Asuka moved forward, and sat back down in the water to let all of the soap rinse off. With the differing temperatures of water mixing right there, there was strong convection induced currents that allowed the soap to flow quickly away. Shinji sat beside her, tentatively stroking her soft skin, moving his fingers in circles. He was quickly growing used to the thought of touching her skin. He slowly, almost imperceptibly stroked his hand along the underside of one of her breasts.  
他们就这样待了几分钟，然后明日香向前移动，坐回水中让所有的肥皂冲洗干净。由于水温的差异混合在一起，产生了强烈的对流诱导水流，使得肥皂迅速流走。真嗣坐在她旁边，试探性地抚摸她柔软的皮肤，手指画着圈。他很快就习惯了触摸她肌肤的想法。他缓慢地，几乎难以察觉地用手沿着她一只乳房的下方抚摸。

"Hey now, if we are going to do that, we need to go back to the house, and get back in bed, I think." Shinji sheepishly withdrew from her breast. The warmth of the water was great for Shinji. It caused his muscles to relax. He had been wound up so tight for so long, that allowing a relaxing time was just what the doctor ordered.  
“嘿，现在，如果我们打算那样做，我们需要回到屋里，回到床上，我想。”真嗣尴尬地从她的乳房上收回手。水的温暖对真嗣来说很棒。它让他的肌肉放松。他已经紧绷了太久，放松一下正是医生所建议的。

After another 15 minutes or so of quiet contemplation in the water, Asuka reached over and touched his arm lightly. "Shinji? You ready to go."  
又过了大约 15 分钟的静谧沉思，绫波轻轻地伸出手，触碰了他的手臂。“真嗣？准备回去了吗？”

"Yeah. This was nice. I liked it." They stood and moved back to the shore. The tarp holding their things became their dressing area. Asuka was still mostly naked, and Shinji watched with great interest while she redressed. While it was a little embarrassing, she saw that he not only had a curious look in his eye, he also had a rather growing bulge in his pants. He noticed her looking, and his face got red, and he apologized a couple of times.  
“嗯。这里很舒服，我喜欢。”他们起身走向岸边，那块防水布成了他们的更衣区。绫波依然近乎赤裸，真嗣饶有兴致地看着她重新穿衣。虽然有些尴尬，但她注意到他眼中不仅充满了好奇，裤裆处也明显有了反应。他察觉到她的目光，脸颊泛红，连声道歉。

It was a short ride back up to the house, and then they stored the snow- mobile and covered it. The house had warmed up considerably from the sunshine now streaming in through the windows, and it was not long before they even cracked a window to let some of the heat out.  
他们骑着雪地摩托很快回到了房子，存放好并覆盖起来。阳光透过窗户洒进屋内，屋子已经暖和了许多，不久他们甚至打开了一扇窗，让部分热气散出去。

The day was waning and both of them were getting hungry. Another quarter of the Hungarian coffee cake was quickly devoured, then Shinji told Asuka that he was going to lie down for a while. She smiled as he went into his room. Maybe this was him saying that he wanted her to come in so they could fool around.  
天色渐晚，两人都感到饥饿。他们迅速吃掉了剩下的四分之一匈牙利咖啡蛋糕，随后真嗣告诉明日香他要躺一会儿。她看着他走进房间，脸上露出微笑。或许这是他在暗示希望她进来，好让他们嬉闹一番。

She eased the door open, and saw him laying there. He looked up not really betraying any emotion and saw her, lifting the covers for her to get in. She noticed he had only boxer shorts on as well.  
她轻轻推开门，看到他躺在那里。他抬头望向她，脸上没有太多表情，只是掀开被子示意她进来。她注意到他也只穿着平角短裤。

Asuka quickly undressed again, leaving only her panties on, and slid into the covers next to him. She noticed immediately that he was still semi hard, and her presence was having a profound effect on a certain body part. She straddled him, wrapping her arms under his, and leaned down to kiss him. They kissed like this for what seemed like a long time before Asuka rose up, and placed a hand on Shinji's chest. She slid it down, and felt for him, and wrapped her hand around him. Shinji reached up to her, and stroked her soft breasts, wondering at them. He wondered why he had not wanted to do this earlier. Of course he had not really had the chance to do it much earlier either. He stroked the nipples and licked at them while Asuka played with him. It was very arousing, and they soon decided to stop if they wanted to hold out any longer.  
明日香迅速再次脱去衣物，仅留下内裤，滑入他身旁的被窝。她立刻注意到他依旧半勃起，她的存在对某个部位产生了深远的影响。她跨坐在他身上，双臂环抱他的背部，俯身亲吻他。他们就这样亲吻了许久，直到明日香抬起身，将手放在真嗣的胸口，缓缓下滑，握住了他。真嗣伸手抚摸她柔软的乳房，心中疑惑为何之前未曾想这么做。当然，他之前也确实没有太多机会。他轻抚乳头，舔舐着，而明日香则逗弄着他。这极为撩人，他们很快决定若还想继续忍耐，就必须停下。

Both of them rested, Asuka lying on top of Shinji. She liked listening to his heartbeat. It had a soothing effect. The rhythm was slow and natural. They had both had fun exploring each other. Shinji had been fascinated by the fact that he could please Asuka, having never known anything about pleasing a woman before. Asuka too had enjoyed playing, more like tormenting, her lover beneath her. She was careful to only excite him but not really arouse him.  
两人都休息了，明日香躺在真嗣身上。她喜欢听他的心跳声，那有一种安抚人心的效果。节奏缓慢而自然。他们一起探索彼此，玩得很开心。真嗣对能取悦明日香感到着迷，他之前从未了解过如何取悦一个女人。明日香也享受着在上方逗弄她的爱人，更像是在折磨他。她小心翼翼地只让他兴奋，但并不真正挑起他的欲望。

No words were spoken, they kissed occasionally that being the only communication between the two, and it was enough.  
没有言语交流，他们偶尔亲吻，这是两人之间唯一的沟通方式，而这已经足够。

Much later both teens emerged from the room, and Shinji closed the window that had been opened. It was getting cooler in the house, so he decided that they could have a fire in the wood-burning stove. While he went out to get more wood, Asuka loaded the washing machine with their collective laundry.  
很久以后，两个少年从房间里出来，真嗣关上了之前打开的窗户。屋子里越来越凉，他决定可以在烧木头的炉子里生火。他出去取木柴时，明日香则把他们的衣物一起放进洗衣机里。

Shinji had learned how to build fires from Kensuke. He had learned many useful things from the boy while he had known him, and was thankful that he had learned them. Within minutes, the fire was roaring, and in half an hour it was going well enough to engage the catalytic converter. There was a thermometer on the top of the stove, and Shinji watched as it slowly climbed its way from 600 degrees to well over 1200 in just a few minutes. Occasionally soot buildup that had accumulated on the inside of the stovepipe would break loose and fall down into the stove where it would be burned again.  
真嗣从健介那里学会了如何生火。在他认识健介的这段时间里，他从他那里学到了许多有用的东西，并为此感到庆幸。不出几分钟，火势便熊熊燃烧起来，半小时后，火已经足够旺盛，可以启动催化转换器了。炉子顶部有一个温度计，真嗣看着它从 600 度缓慢攀升，仅用几分钟就超过了 1200 度。偶尔，积聚在烟囱内壁的煤灰会脱落，掉进炉子里再次燃烧。

Shinji sat and watched the fire for a minute or two, then Asuka turned off the lights and joined him. "Shinji, you think we could talk?"  
真嗣坐下，凝视着火焰一两分钟，随后明日香关掉了灯，加入了他。“真嗣，你觉得我们可以谈谈吗？”

"Sure, what did you have in mind to talk about?"  
“当然，你想谈些什么呢？”

Asuka sat on the floor next to him, and reclined against the foot of the easy chair, drawing her knees up. She looked over at him, and was quiet for a minute. "When did you start loving me, Shinji?"  
明日香坐在他旁边的地板上，背靠着休闲椅的脚，蜷起双腿。她转头看向他，沉默了一会儿。“你是什么时候开始爱上我的，真嗣？”

He took a few moments to contemplate it. "I don't know. I think that I have always loved you at least a little bit, but I just started loving you more since we have been here together."  
他沉思了片刻。“我不清楚。我想我一直对你至少有一点点爱意，但自从我们在一起后，我对你的爱就变得更深了。”

"Did you ever think about what our children might be like if we ever have any? I mean would we be good parents?"  
“你有没有想过如果我们有孩子，他们会是什么样？我是说，我们会是好父母吗？”

Shinji thought about this for a long time. He knew where she was coming from. They always said that you are just like your parents were, so what kind of parents would that make them. They would just have to make sure to be good ones. "I... I think you would be a great mother."  
真嗣对此思考了很久。他明白她的出发点。人们常说，你就像你的父母一样，那么他们会成为什么样的父母呢。他们只需确保成为好的父母。“我……我想你会是一个伟大的母亲。”

Asuka smiled at this. She had hoped that he would say something like that. It was only recently in her life that she had wondered about her future and her offspring. Would she ever have any? Who would they be? And what could she do to make them the best they could be? "Shinji, I love you." She had a very concerned look upon her face.  
明日香对此微笑了。她曾希望他会这么说。直到最近，她才开始思考自己的未来和后代。她会有孩子吗？他们会是谁？她又能做些什么让他们成为最好的自己？“真嗣，我爱你。”她的脸上带着非常关切的表情。

"Is there something wrong, Asuka? If there is, you can tell me, OK?"  
“有什么不对吗，明日香？如果有，你可以告诉我，好吗？”

"Nothing wrong. I have just been worrying, that is all."  
"没什么不对。我只是有些担心，仅此而已。"

"About what?" Shinji was worried. He did not like seeing Asuka unsure of herself. It was such an unnatural thing. She was normally very self-assured.  
"担心什么？" 真嗣感到担忧。他不喜欢看到明日香对自己不确定的样子。这太不自然了。她通常非常自信。

"I just got to thinking a little while ago about kids, and I want to have some. Not right now mind you, but sometime in the future. And I just didn't know what to expect or what is going to happen or anything. I think about things like that and I get worried. Did you ever get the feeling that we are here for some specific purpose?" She waited for his nod. "I just sometimes think that I am going to screw it up."  
"我刚才想了一会儿关于孩子的事，我想将来要几个。不是现在，我是说将来某个时候。我只是不知道会发生什么，或者该期待什么。我想到这些事情就会担心。你有没有过那种感觉，我们在这里是有某种特定目的的？" 她等待着他的点头。"我只是有时候觉得我会搞砸一切。"

Shinji drew her closer to him, putting his arms around her. "Hey, it's OK. It is alright. You're allowed to doubt yourself occasionally. I think we may have been left here for something, and maybe along the way we will figure it out. But regardless we can't just start second guessing ourselves and tormenting ourselves about messing up."  
真嗣将她拉近自己，双臂环绕着她。“嘿，没事的。一切都会好起来的。偶尔怀疑自己是可以的。我想我们被留在这里是有原因的，也许在过程中我们会弄明白。但无论如何，我们不能一开始就怀疑自己，折磨自己，担心搞砸了。”

Asuka's uncertainty about their future weighed heavily on her mind. Somewhere deep in the back of her mind, she had known that she would fall in love with him. Where did this love come from? Had she seen the qualities that she was attracted to in this boy? It was true that he had changed since they had reemerged into this world.  
明日香对未来的不确定感沉重地压在心头。在她内心深处，她早已知道她会爱上他。这份爱从何而来？她是否在这个男孩身上看到了吸引她的品质？确实，自从他们重新回到这个世界后，他变了。

But what next? A family? To what end? Practicality was her forte, and the idea of a family was not practical. The simple truth of it was that if they had children, who would they have children with? Each other? While the thought of incest was certainly not appealing, that was the only idea that she could come up with. And what of their children? Would they then be problematic? The risk of physical deformation and mental problems was too great to risk on something like that, right? But then, what of the fate of humanity? Would they die out like this? Afraid to propagate for fear of dooming future generations?  
但接下来呢？一个家庭？为了什么？实用性是她的强项，而家庭这个概念并不实用。简单的事实是，如果他们有孩子，会和谁生孩子？彼此吗？虽然乱伦的想法确实不吸引人，但这是她唯一能想到的方案。那么他们的孩子呢？他们会成为问题吗？身体畸形和精神问题的风险太大，不能冒这样的险，对吧？但话说回来，人类的命运又将如何？他们会这样灭绝吗？因为害怕给后代带来厄运而不敢繁衍？

Perhaps these questions would be answered in time. But she did not see what the answered could be.  
或许这些问题随着时间会得到解答。但她看不出答案会是什么。

And what of all of this technology that they had? They knew next to nothing about it. And assuming they were able to figure ways of getting past the family problems, how could they teach their children about all of this stuff enough to run it and maintain it when they themselves did not know about it. They needed a major repository of information the problem was that she did not know where something like that would be, nor how to get there.  
再说他们拥有的这些技术，他们几乎一无所知。假设他们能找到解决家庭问题的方法，他们又如何能教会孩子操作和维护这一切，当他们自己都不了解时。他们需要一个巨大的信息库，问题是她不知道这样的地方在哪里，也不知道如何到达那里。

Shinji was running his fingers through her hair. It had grown longer, and was reaching further and further down her back. This long mane of fiery hair. Red was a good color, and he liked its texture too. Asuka liked the feel of him combing it out with his fingers; it was like a gentle massage on her head.  
真嗣正用手指梳理着她的头发。它已经长长了，越来越垂到她的背部。这一头火红的秀发。红色是个好颜色，而且他也喜欢它的质感。明日香喜欢他用手指梳理的感觉；就像是在她头上进行轻柔的按摩。

The sun had gone down long ago, and even though they had not done really done anything that day, they were a little tired. It was probably _because_ they didn't do anything all day. Asuka wondered about this. Maybe they should make up for it by being active that night.  
太阳早已落下，尽管他们那天并没有真正做什么，却感到有些疲惫。大概是因为一整天什么都没做吧。明日香对此感到疑惑。也许他们应该在那个晚上补回来，变得活跃一些。

Shinji stretched and popped his neck. Well, maybe it was time for sleep instead. Shinji took a quick bath while Asuka sat on the side of the tub dipping her feet in.  
真嗣伸了个懒腰，扭了扭脖子。嗯，也许该是睡觉的时候了。真嗣快速洗了个澡，而明日香则坐在浴缸边上，把脚泡在水里。

"Shinji, do you think that I am just a little girl? Misato always said I was."  
"真嗣，你觉得我只是个小女孩吗？美里总是这么说。"

"Maybe you were, but I don't think you are now. It also depends on how you mean. Physically? I think we are both still children. I mean I am 15 and you are about to be 15 too. We both still have a long way to go before we're grown. But if you're talking about emotionally or even cognitively I think we are both adults. We are doing what adults do. Scratching out an existence, and we are responsible for our actions. That is what being an adult means to me."  
"或许你曾经是，但我不认为你现在还是。这也要看你怎么理解。从生理上讲？我觉得我们俩都还是孩子。我 15 岁，你也快 15 岁了。我们离真正长大还有很长的路要走。但如果从情感或认知上来说，我认为我们都已经算是成年人了。我们在做成年人做的事。努力生存，对自己的行为负责。对我来说，这就是成年的意义。"

"Maybe." Asuka swirled her finger around in the water, making little wakes flow out from it. "I am just... I can't make up my mind about something."  
"也许吧。" 明日香在水中旋转着手指，激起一圈圈涟漪。"我只是...有些事情我无法下定决心。"

"Well you know you can tell me about it, right? I have always wanted to hear what you think." Shinji relaxed into the tub. The cold tile contrasted sharply with the hot water.  
“你知道你可以告诉我这件事的，对吧？我一直想听听你的想法。” 真嗣放松地泡在浴缸里。冰冷的瓷砖与热水形成了鲜明对比。

"I know." Asuka stalled while she thought about what she would say. "Its about having sex." Can't get more blunt than that. "I want you really bad, but... I just don't want to turn something beautiful into something we might be sorry about. I mean what if I get pregnant? Or what if I rush you into it and it just doesn't hold the same meaning for you?"  
“我知道。” 明日香犹豫了一下，思考着该怎么说。“是关于做爱的事。” 这话已经够直白了。“我非常想要你，但是……我不想把美好的东西变成我们可能会后悔的事。我是说，万一我怀孕了怎么办？或者万一我催促你，而对你来说它失去了原本的意义怎么办？”

Shinji understood. He had thought a lot about this while he was hoping for her to love him. When it came to pregnancy, there was always something to be done about that. Man had been trying to circumvent the whole situation for time immemorial. Of course there was nothing in the house that would help with that. They would need to get to town for contraceptive supplies. And in the snow there was little chance of that except with the sno-cat.  
真嗣明白了。他曾多次思考过这个问题，希望她能爱上他。关于怀孕，总有一些办法可以应对。人类自古以来一直在尝试规避这种情况。当然，家里没有任何东西能帮上忙。他们需要进城购买避孕用品。而在雪地里，除了雪猫车，几乎没有其他可能。

As for her disappointing him, he was worried about disappointing her too. Of course he figured there was little that she could do to disappoint him. He could understand, if not immediately he would eventually.  
至于让她失望，他也担心自己会让她失望。当然，他认为她几乎没有什么能让他失望的。他可以理解，即使不是立刻，他最终也会明白。

"Well, lets hold off a little longer OK?"  
“好吧，我们再等一会儿，好吗？”

"But that is just the thing, Shinji!" She stopped abruptly realizing that she was getting loud. "I just. I am going to go crazy, I want you so bad."  
“但问题就在这里，真嗣！”她突然停下，意识到自己声音太大了。“我只是……我会疯掉的，我太想要你了。”

Shinji smiled at that. If someone had told him 6 months ago that he would hear those words from Asuka some day, he would likely have laughed. There was no way that it would happen. Yet here they were, in love, and unable to show it in the sublime form that couples normally did.  
真嗣对此微微一笑。如果半年前有人告诉他，有一天会从明日香口中听到这些话，他大概会笑出声来。这根本不可能发生。然而现在，他们相爱着，却无法像普通情侣那样以完美的形式表达出来。

Shinji stood and toweled off, trying to keep from showing too much of himself off to the girl. After he put some shorts on, he and Asuka went back to the living room and sat in front of the wood-burning stove.  
真嗣站起来，用毛巾擦干身体，尽量不让女孩看到太多。穿上短裤后，他和明日香回到客厅，坐在燃木炉前。

"We could always go to town, and raid the doctors office. I am sure they have some form of contraception there."  
“我们总可以去镇上，闯进医生的办公室。我敢肯定那里有某种避孕措施。”

"Yeah, but what if it does something weird to me? They have to prescribe that stuff; you can't just pull it off the shelf."  
"是啊，但如果它对我有什么奇怪的影响呢？他们必须开处方；你不能随便从架子上拿下来。"

"Well with all the stuff we have been through, we will check it out OK? They have to have some kind of system for prescribing it, and whatever it is, we can do it. Which would you prefer anyhow? They have that old pill, but they have started using the patch more nowadays."  
"好吧，经历了这么多，我们会检查清楚的，好吗？他们肯定有某种开处方的系统，不管是什么，我们都能搞定。你更倾向于哪种？他们有那种老药丸，但现在更多地开始使用贴片了。"

"Patch?" Asuka had heard of it, there were even girls in the grades above hers that had used it, and they swore by it.  
"贴片？" 明日香听说过，甚至有她年级以上的女生用过，她们对此赞不绝口。

"Yeah, Supposedly it lasts all week, and simpler to remember too. I hate taking pills, but a patch is a lot more comfortable."  
"是啊，据说这贴片能持续一整周，而且更容易记住。我讨厌吃药，但贴片舒服多了。"

"Well." Asuka was kind of antsy about taking medications. Even if they were just hormone suppressants. "We'll see. I'll behave myself OK? But you better do the same. If you get me in the sack, I'll have to hurt you!" Her grin was enough to tell Shinji that she was just playing, but that she was serious about being good. Not that he would try to get in her pants without her permission anyhow.  
"好吧。" 明日香对吃药有点不安，即使是激素抑制剂。"我们会看到的。我会乖乖的，好吗？但你最好也一样。如果你敢把我弄上床，我可要揍你了！" 她的笑容足以告诉真嗣她只是在开玩笑，但她确实认真地表示会乖。不过，他也不会未经她允许就试图对她做什么。

Asuka let loose a monstrous yawn, and that induced an identical yawn from Shinji. "Of course you know that we will still sleep together." Asuka put in with that sly look in her eyes. "And I still get to play around with you."  
明日香打了个大大的哈欠，这让真嗣也跟着打了个同样的哈欠。"当然，你知道我们还是会一起睡的。" 明日香眨着狡黠的眼睛补充道，"而且我还可以继续和你玩闹。"

Shinji grumbled for a second. "Well, then I still get to play with you too. And that does not just mean your breasts either. Hah!"  
真嗣咕哝了一声。“好吧，那我还是能和你一起玩。而且那不仅仅是指你的胸部。哈！”

"Fine!" Asuka jumped up and raced for the back of the house. Even with her slight lead, Shinji managed to over take her, and give her a good tickling for her trouble. Since the stove was closed down and would simmer where it was for several more hours heating the rest of the house, they decided to call it a night. After a quick teeth brushing, they were both in the sleeping bags. They had connected the two of them to afford more sleeping room. One of these days they would go get a bed or a large futon.  
“好啦！”明日香跳起来，冲向屋子的后面。尽管她稍稍领先，真嗣还是设法超过了她，并为了她的麻烦好好挠了她一顿。由于炉子已经关上，会在原地继续慢炖几个小时，为屋子的其他部分供暖，他们决定今晚就到此为止。快速刷完牙后，两人都钻进了睡袋。他们把两个睡袋连在一起，以便有更多的睡眠空间。总有一天他们会去买张床或一张大蒲团。

Even with the talk they had been having all day, it was hard to restrain themselves. A couple of times Asuka was ready to throw caution to the wind. But Shinji, ever aware of their situation, stopped her short. They did have fun though, and the breathing got heavy for a while, but when it got too warm in the sleeping bags, Asuka opened it up, and let in some cool air. She lay beside Shinji catching her breath and biting his arm a little.  
尽管他们一整天都在交谈，但很难克制自己。有好几次明日香准备不顾一切。但真嗣，始终意识到他们的处境，及时阻止了她。不过他们确实玩得很开心，呼吸也变得急促了一阵，但当睡袋里变得太热时，明日香打开了它，让一些凉爽的空气进来。她躺在真嗣旁边，喘着气，轻轻咬了他的手臂一下。

"I love you, Asuka. You know that?"  
"我爱你，明日香。你知道的吧？"

"Yup. I love you too Shinji." She bit his arm hard to prove it, and lay back looking at the ceiling.  
"嗯。我也爱你，真嗣。" 她用力咬了他的手臂一下以示证明，然后躺回床上望着天花板。"

"You know I think this has been the most pleasant day that I have ever had?"  
"你知道吗，我觉得这是我度过的最愉快的一天了？"

"I am glad that I could be a part of it with you, Shinji."  
"我很高兴能和你一起成为其中的一部分，真嗣。"

They talked about movies, and people they had known and funny things that they had seen or done. Despite their apparent sleepiness a while ago, they chatted away until after midnight, when finally they went to sleep. Asuka woke up a while later to find Shinji nuzzled in between her breasts. It was a little funny to her, and she wrapped her arms around him and fell back to sleep.  
他们谈论着电影，认识的人，以及看到或做过的有趣事情。尽管之前显得有些困倦，他们一直聊到午夜之后才终于入睡。不久后，明日香醒来发现真嗣蜷缩在她的胸前。这让她觉得有点好笑，于是她抱紧他，再次进入梦乡。

ADDENDUM Soaplands- Soap lands are basically like a brothel. But more than that, they are a place that cater to the customers wishes. The women are generally given room and board and well kept. Some of these have specific themes. Basically a guy goes to one, and if he knows of a girl that he likes, he can ask for her. The name Soapland comes from the kind of cover story that they are a private bathing place where the women bathe the customers, but everyone knows better. Sort of to help their image I guess. Anyhow it is legal prostitution. Not to be confused with love hotels.  
附录 泡泡浴- 泡泡浴基本上类似于妓院。但不仅如此，它们是迎合顾客愿望的地方。女性通常提供食宿，并得到良好的照顾。其中一些有特定的主题。基本上，一个男人去那里，如果他知道一个他喜欢的女孩，他可以要求她。泡泡浴这个名字来源于它们是一种私人沐浴场所的掩护故事，女性为顾客沐浴，但大家都知道事实并非如此。我想这大概是为了帮助他们的形象。无论如何，这是合法的卖淫。不要与爱情旅馆混淆。

### Chapter 10 Day146

Shinji slipped out of the house and crossed over the hard packed snow that covered the walkway from the house to the garage. The snow had melted and fallen several times since the beginning of the winter, and that had allowed them several trips into town for needed items. Another space heater, lighters and flashlights, batteries, more cooking utensils and things of that sort. On one such trip, Shinji had made a secret detour to get some other things that he needed. These were the most important of all.  
真嗣悄悄溜出房子，跨过覆盖在从房子到车库的小路上的硬实积雪。自冬天开始以来，雪已经融化并落下好几次了，这让他们得以进城几次购买必需品。又一台取暖器、打火机和手电筒、电池、更多的烹饪用具以及诸如此类的东西。在一次这样的旅行中，真嗣偷偷绕道去买了一些他需要的东西。这些是最重要的。

The garage had been partitioned and one half turned into a shop area. It had all manner of machines. Woodworking, metal lathes, cutting and welding torches. Shinji did not know much about any of that, but for his purposes he could manage with what was at hand.  
车库被隔开，一半改造成了工作区。里面有各种各样的机器。木工、金属车床、切割和焊接用的喷灯。真嗣对这些并不太了解，但为了他的目的，他可以用手头的工具应付。

The early dawn light was filtering in through the window, and he flipped the light switch on. The florescent bulbs hummed monotonously in the still shop. Everything was kept neat and tidy, no shavings on the floor, no tools out of place; the owner of this house had been a stickler for neatness. The tall metal wall locker in the corner had a fairly new padlock on it, one that Shinji had obtained to keep his live-in love from entering the metal case.  
晨曦初露，光线透过窗户洒入，他随即打开了电灯开关。荧光灯在静谧的店铺中单调地嗡嗡作响。一切都被打理得井井有条，地板上没有木屑，工具也各归其位；这间屋子的主人向来对整洁有着严格的要求。角落里高大的金属储物柜上挂着一把相当新的挂锁，那是真嗣为了防止同居的爱人擅自打开金属箱而特意准备的。

Unlocking it, he opened the doors with a little squeak, and began pulling out the items that were stacked neatly in a box. A book, a portable torch that was clamped in place on a stand with a base, and most importantly several gold rings that he had selected from one of the abandoned jewelry stores.  
他解锁后，柜门轻轻一响便打开了，开始从整齐堆放在盒子里的物品中一件件取出。一本书，一个固定在支架底座上的便携式手电筒，以及最重要的，从一家废弃珠宝店中挑选出的几枚金戒指。

It had been nearly a week ago that he had realized it was closing in on Asuka's birthday. He wanted to give her something special; something that would show his love for her, at least a little bit. He had fiddled around on the metal lathe for days trying to make the form for the ring. And even before that, he had kept himself awake one night to get a good measurement of Asuka's finger. He had once heard that it was best to measure things like that when you had just woken up since fingers and toes were swollen a bit, but it could not be helped. He would just have to fudge a little.  
大约一周前，他意识到明日香生日将近。他想送她一份特别的礼物；一份能表达他对她爱意的礼物，哪怕只是一点点。他在金属车床上捣鼓了好几天，试图制作出戒指的形状。甚至在更早之前，他熬了一整夜，只为准确测量明日香的指围。他曾听说，刚醒来时测量手指和脚趾最为合适，因为那时它们会有些肿胀，但这次情况特殊，他只能稍作调整。

The form was made out of a piece of stainless steel that he had lathed a small slender circle into, nearly an inch deep. Then he cut it neatly in half so that when he poured the molten metal into it, he could cool it then extract it. But before he would be doing any of that he wanted to refine the metal.  
戒指的模具是用一块不锈钢制成的，他在上面车削出一个细小的圆环，深度近一英寸。然后将其整齐地切成两半，这样在倒入熔融金属后，他可以冷却并取出成品。但在进行这些步骤之前，他想先提炼金属。

Most rings did have a fair amount of gold in them, but they also had a good amount of filler too. To remedy this, he was going to smelt the rings and get the purer gold to make the ring out of. A pure gold ring would be very soft, probably unwearable, but with a little bit of copper and zinc (a very little bit) it would be strong enough to accept wear. A large sturdy metal workbench sat opposite the metal cabinet, and with the powerful lamp that accompanied it, it made the ideal area to work in.  
大多数戒指确实含有相当数量的黄金，但同时也掺杂了不少填充物。为了解决这个问题，他打算熔炼这些戒指，提取更纯净的黄金来制作新戒指。纯金戒指会非常柔软，可能无法佩戴，但只要加入少量铜和锌（非常少量），它就能变得足够坚固以承受日常磨损。一张宽敞结实的金属工作台位于金属柜对面，加上那盏强力台灯，这里成了理想的作业区域。

Using some large "C" clamps Shinji fastened the base and torch assembly to the table, then flicked on the light and waited for it to pop and flicker to life.  
使用几个大型“C”形夹，真嗣将底座和焊枪组件固定在桌子上，然后打开灯光，等待它闪烁着亮起。

Shinji had taken the book from the library after reading several chapters of it, and going over the things that he would need to produce the gold that he wanted. According to the text before gold started being leached and electrolyzed, it was fluxed to get the impurities out. This entailed melting the gold alloy (or in the case of the text the gold ore) and adding flux to it to pull the impurities to the op while it cooled. Then the flux and base could be chipped off and the process could be done again.  
真嗣在图书馆借阅了这本书，在阅读了几个章节并仔细研究了所需制作黄金的方法后。根据书中的描述，在黄金开始被浸出和电解之前，会通过添加助熔剂来去除杂质。这包括熔化黄金合金（或书中提到的金矿石），并加入助熔剂以在冷却时吸附杂质浮至表面。随后，助熔剂和底层可以被敲除，整个过程可以重复进行。

He dipped into the box once more, and produced a small black bowl that had the consistency of cast iron. It had been very hard to find, but it was worth it. The black lead crucible was pretty heavy for its size. He had managed to find a metallurgical supply in town, and this was the smallest one they had.  
他再次探入箱中，取出一只小巧的黑碗，质地坚硬如铸铁。这东西极难寻觅，但终究是值得的。这只黑铅坩埚虽小，却异常沉重。他在镇上好不容易找到一家冶金材料店，而这已是店里最小的型号了。

The night before he had measured out some borax and niter that would be used as flux. They mixed easily enough, and he set it aside so that it would not be in the way. He wanted to be extra careful when smelting and casting the gold. One wrong move could result in disfigurement and even death.  
前一晚，他已量取了些硼砂和硝石作为助熔剂。它们混合得颇为顺利，他便将其搁置一旁，以免碍事。在熔炼和铸造黄金时，他希望格外小心。一旦操作失误，可能导致伤残甚至丧命。

Since gold had such a high melting point, it was necessary to cut the rings into small pieces and pile them into the crucible, then heat them that way. Otherwise they would shed heat too quickly to melt. Grabbing the sparking igniter, he turned up the gas on the torch and lit it, bringing a hissing flame into being.  
由于黄金熔点极高，必须将戒指切成小块，堆入坩埚，再以这种方式加热。否则它们会散热过快，难以熔化。他抓起电火花点火器，调高气焊枪的燃气阀，点燃火焰，一束嘶嘶作响的火舌随即腾起。

The mount that it was attached to allowed him to swivel it down so that that flame was directed into the middle of the crucible. Within minutes, the pieces of gold alloy were melting together into a growing pool of bright yellow.  
它所附着的支架让他能够将其旋转下来，使火焰对准坩埚中央。不出几分钟，金合金碎片便开始熔化，汇聚成一汪明亮的黄色液体。

He started applying the flux, and stirred it in with a stainless steel rod he had liberated from the store. The flux mixed easily burning a little as it mixed. It added a brown color to the pool then as it continued heating it turned a nice medium red, and swirled a little. Shinji turned off the torch, and let it cool. In a moment, the flux began floating to the top, now black instead of the white yellow it was when he put it in.  
他开始涂抹助熔剂，并用从店里拿来的不锈钢棒搅拌。助熔剂混合得很容易，燃烧时略带一点，给液体增添了一抹棕色，随着持续加热，它变成了漂亮的砖红色，并微微旋转。真嗣关掉喷灯，让其冷却。片刻后，助熔剂开始浮到表面，现在变成了黑色，不再是加入时的白黄色。

He took the tongs, also black lead, and picked up the crucible, tipping it into the mold he had made. There was a thin coat of oil on the inside of it to help the gold set in the cast. Otherwise it would bond with the cast and then both the gold and the cast would be useless. He quickly, but not hurriedly poured the molten mixture into the cast, and was rewarded with the burning oil smell. The surface of the poured gold turned black.  
他拿起同样涂有黑铅的钳子，夹起坩埚，倾斜倒入事先准备好的模具中。模具内壁涂有一层薄油，以帮助金子在铸模中凝固。否则金子会与铸模粘合，导致金子和铸模都报废。他迅速但并不匆忙地将熔融混合物倒入铸模，随即闻到了燃烧的油味。浇铸的金子表面变黑了。

After only a second, he released the clamps holding the cast firmly together, and managed to work the still hot, but not molten, gold out of it. The slag chipped off easily, falling away to reveal a bright shining yellow surface. He then dunked the cast gold into a bucket of pickle, which was just water and sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid was surprisingly easy to find. It was kept in varying concentrations in a chemical supply place just down the street from the metallurgical establishment.  
仅仅一秒钟后，他便松开了固定铸件的夹钳，设法将尚热但未熔化的黄金从中取出。炉渣轻易地剥落，掉落后露出明亮闪耀的黄色表面。接着，他将铸造的黄金浸入一桶酸洗液中，这不过是水和硫酸的混合物。硫酸出乎意料地容易找到，它在一家化学品供应店里以不同浓度存放，这家店就位于冶金机构所在街道的对面。

He let it sit for a second then dunked it into plain water. He was left with a half inch thick ring of gold. He turned it over in his hand imagining what he would do with it, what he would shape it into.  
他让它浸泡片刻，然后将其浸入清水中。最终，他得到了一枚半英寸厚的金环。他用手翻转着金环，想象着要用它做什么，要将它打造成什么形状。

The library book had gone into exacting detail about how to accomplish the smelting and fluxing process, but it went even further when it came to shaping and polishing. With the wide array of machinist's tools and metal working stuff that he had in the work area, he figured he could accomplish whatever he set out for himself.  
那本图书馆的书详细介绍了如何完成熔炼和助熔过程，但在成型和抛光方面更是深入。凭借工作区域内丰富的机械师工具和金属加工设备，他认为自己能够实现任何设定的目标。

But time intruded. His watch beeped. It was 8:00 and Asuka would be getting up soon. He had finished with the more worrisome part of the crafting, Shinji had half expected Asuka to interrupt him in the middle of it, probably asking him to come back to bed. He had spent nearly an hour already, but still had more to do. He would get to it later. Now it was time for breakfast.  
但时间不等人。他的手表发出哔哔声。已经是早上八点了，明日香应该快起床了。他完成了制作中较为棘手的部分，真嗣本以为明日香会在中途打断他，可能还会叫他回床上。他已经花了将近一个小时，但还有更多工作要做。他稍后再继续。现在该吃早餐了。

Most of the pieces he could pack back in the locker, but the still hot pieces he left out, tucked away so they could cool unnoticed. He locked the locker back up and walked back in the house.  
大部分零件他可以重新放回储物柜，但那些尚有余热的零件则被他留在外面，小心翼翼地藏好以便它们在不被察觉中冷却。他锁好储物柜，走回屋内。

This house had been good to he and Asuka. They enjoyed warmth in the winter and cool in the summer. Whoever had built it had been very good at what they did.  
这栋房子对他们俩一直很好。他们在冬天感到温暖，夏天感到凉爽。无论是谁建造了它，都做得非常出色。

Back inside, he started preparing his usual miso soup for himself and toast with homemade jelly for Asuka. He was just putting the jelly on the toast when his redheaded companion stepped out of the bedroom with a yawn.  
回到屋内，他开始为自己准备通常的味噌汤，以及给明日香做的吐司配自制果酱。他刚把果酱涂在吐司上，红发的同伴就打着哈欠从卧室走了出来。

"Hey, Shinji. Where did you go? I woke up and you weren't there."  
“嘿，真嗣。你去哪儿了？我醒来时你不在。”

Shinji felt bad for doing that. He did not like hiding his intentions from her, but if he wanted the ring to be a surprise it would be necessary for him to fib just a little bit. "Oh, I couldn't sleep so I went and messed around in the workshop."  
真嗣为此感到内疚。他不喜欢对她隐瞒自己的意图，但如果他想让戒指成为惊喜，那么稍微撒个小谎是必要的。“哦，我睡不着，所以去车间里捣鼓了一会儿。”

"Oh, did you make something for me?" She smiled at him brightly, hugging him from behind.  
"哦，你给我做了什么吗？" 她灿烂地笑着，从背后抱住他。

Shinji froze. Maybe she was just faking the fact that she just woke up. Maybe she knew all about the ring, or his intentions to make it for her. But if she knew about it, she would likely confront him directly about it, not try to pry it out of him deceptively. "Well, I just kind of messed around. Didn't really work on anything at all."  
真嗣僵住了。也许她只是在假装刚睡醒。也许她知道戒指的事，或者他打算为她做戒指的意图。但如果她知道，她很可能会直接质问他，而不是试图用欺骗的手段从他那里套出话来。"嗯，我只是随便玩玩。其实什么都没做。"

"Oh. OK. I see you found more strawberry jelly." She was eyeing the delicious looking toast. They had located stacks of jars of jelly and preserved fruits in a pantry of a house down the road where they had been switching off circuit breakers. Asuka had thought they had run out of the strawberry, but apparently they had not. It was her favorite.  
"哦。好吧。我看到你又找到了草莓果酱。" 她盯着看起来美味的吐司。他们在路边一所房子的食品储藏室里找到了成堆的果酱和腌制水果，他们一直在那里轮流更换断路器。明日香以为草莓果酱已经用完了，但显然并没有。那是她的最爱。

"Yeah, there are actually a couple of jars left. They were mixed in with other fruits. I think Mr. Takaeda really liked the strawberry too, he had quite a bit of it."  
“是啊，实际上还剩下几罐。它们和其他水果混在一起。我想高田先生真的很喜欢草莓，他吃了不少。”

They sat down and ate in near silence. Shinji nearly spat out his soup when Asuka reached under the table surreptitiously and squeezed his knee. He was slowly growing used to the spontaneous displays of affection that she would bestow on him. A few days ago she waited for him to take a shower and she silently snuck into the bathroom naked, and hugged him from behind while he was washing his hair.  
他们坐下来，几乎默默地吃着。当明日香偷偷在桌子下伸手捏了捏他的膝盖时，真嗣差点把汤喷了出来。他正慢慢习惯她突如其来的亲昵举动。几天前，她等他洗澡时悄悄地一丝不挂溜进浴室，从背后抱住正在洗头的他。

He missed regular baths. While he liked her affection, he did not really like being snuck up on, and it is much more difficult to sneak up on someone quietly sitting in the bath.  
他怀念常规的泡澡。虽然喜欢她的爱抚，但他并不喜欢被突然袭击，而且坐在浴缸里更难悄无声息地接近某人。

"Shinji, I just love the way you turn so red when I do things like that. It is so cute." She didn't know why, but the fact that he was embarrassed by that even if there was no possibility that anyone else would see was like bread and butter to her.  
"真嗣，我就是喜欢你那样脸红的样子。真是太可爱了。" 她不知道为什么，但即使没有其他人会看到，他因为这种事而害羞的事实对她来说就像面包和黄油一样不可或缺。

In an uncharacteristically bold move, Shinji squeezed Asuka's knee, but not in the affectionate manner Asuka had. He squeezed a few inches away, and Asuka erupted into a fit of laughter unable to help herself. Shinji had learned of her most ticklish spots, and exploited them when he had to. He really loved hearing her laugh. Especially when he was tickling her.  
真嗣做出了一反常态的大胆举动，他捏了捏明日香的膝盖，但并非像明日香那样充满爱意。他在几英寸远的地方捏了一下，明日香忍不住爆发出一阵大笑。真嗣已经掌握了她最怕痒的地方，并在必要时加以利用。他真的很喜欢听到她的笑声，尤其是当他挠她痒的时候。

They washed dishes together and Shinji told Asuka he was going to go organize some things in the workshop. He was back there a moment later, pulling the wide gold tube out of its hiding spot, and set up on a different table, this one with a view of the side door of the main house, so that he could watch and see if Asuka was coming to check on him.  
他们一起洗碗，真嗣告诉明日香他要去车间整理一些东西。他很快就回来了，从藏匿处拉出那根宽大的金色管子，放在另一张桌子上，这张桌子正对着主屋侧门的视野，这样他就可以观察并看到明日香是否来检查他。

Rather than cut the band down the rotational axis and produce two rings (presumably so that if he messed up he could have a spare), he decided to make one ring that was a bit wider than normal. He wanted it to be something that would be totally his.  
他没有选择沿着旋转轴将金属带切割成两个环（大概是怕万一失败了还有备用），而是决定制作一个比平常稍宽一些的单环。他希望这戒指能完全代表他。

But what to put on the surface? He thought about that for a while trying to describe Asuka in a word that would befit her. And then it struck him. He had been thinking about moving a heater into the room. Fire. Asuka was like fire. Nearly everything she did was a personification of it. She had a mighty temper, and she could flare up instantly. And yet she was warm and friendly when soothed. And let's not forget that hair.  
但表面该刻些什么呢？他思考了许久，试图用一个词来恰如其分地描述明日香。突然间，灵感来了。他原本在考虑把取暖器搬进房间。火。明日香就像火一样。她几乎所有行为都体现了这一点。她脾气火爆，能瞬间爆发。然而，一旦平静下来，她又温暖而友好。别忘了，还有那头红发。

He envisioned flames dancing around the band, licking at the edges, maybe even extending past the edges just a little bit or, standing out from it. It would be difficult, but he was committed to it. But first he wanted to look at some still pictures of fire before trying to put it on the ring. He was rummaging through a box when he found a fire log that had some illustrated fire on it, and it looked exactly like what he wanted to do.  
他想象着火焰在戒指上舞动，舔舐着边缘，甚至可能稍微超出边缘，或者从戒指上突显出来。这虽然困难，但他决心已定。但在动手之前，他想先看看一些火焰的静态图片。他在翻找箱子时，发现了一块带有火焰图案的木柴，那正是他想要的效果。

He put the fire log on the worktable, and looked up just in time to see Asuka closing the door on the house a few feet away from the door to the garage/workshop. He stashed the unworked ring and picked up some tools and started putting them away. When Asuka opened the door he looked over to her, surprised to see her.  
他把柴火放在工作台上，抬头正好看到明日香在几英尺外关上了房子的门。他迅速藏起未加工的戒指，拿起一些工具开始收拾。当明日香打开门时，他惊讶地看向她。

"Is there anything I can do in here Shinji?" She looked around inquisitively. She wanted to help, but she sensed that Shinji wanted to be alone for a while. He had been alone a lot lately.  
“真嗣，这里有什么我能帮忙的吗？”她好奇地环顾四周。她想帮忙，但感觉到真嗣想独自待一会儿。他最近经常一个人。

"Umm, no not really Asuka. I think I have everything under control." He really hated lying to her like this. But he wanted it to be a surprise for her and he could not risk her finding out about it before it was time to give it to her. He wanted her birthday to be perfect.  
“嗯，不，真的不用，明日香。我觉得一切都控制得很好。”他真的很讨厌这样对她撒谎。但他想给她一个惊喜，不能冒险让她在送给她之前发现。他希望她的生日能完美无缺。

"Oh, well, if you say so. I am going to go down and take a bath OK?"  
"哦，好吧，既然你这么说。我要下楼去洗个澡，好吗？"

"OK, I will be right here. Have a good bath Asuka."  
"好的，我会在这里等你。好好洗个澡，明日香。"

Asuka was a little disappointed. She had kind of hoped that he would join her. They had been really restraining themselves for the most part. Taking separate baths or showers. Keeping the making out from getting too hot and heavy. But it was not easy. "Well if you change your mind and want to come be with me, that is where I am. Or you can just come peek at me for a while too." She smiled and wrinkled her nose and shut the door as she left.  
明日香有点失望。她原本有点希望他会加入她。他们大部分时间都在克制自己。分开洗澡或淋浴。避免亲热过头。但这并不容易。“好吧，如果你改变主意想和我一起，我就在那里。或者你也可以来偷看我一会儿。”她笑着皱了皱鼻子，关上门离开了。

Shinji heard the snowmobile roar to life a few minutes later and speed away for the lakeside. He was safe to do as he pleased for a while. Taking the soon-to-be ring in hand, he began carefully etching a fire design into the surface of the gold. He messed up a few times, but the gold was pure enough that it was a little malleable and it was fixed with only a little effort.  
几分钟后，真嗣听到雪地摩托轰鸣着启动，疾驰向湖边。他暂时可以随心所欲地行动。拿起即将成为戒指的金子，他开始小心翼翼地在表面雕刻火焰图案。虽然几次失误，但纯金足够柔软，稍加努力就能修复。

Asuka sank slowly into the hot water. The M-4 carbine she brought with her her was sitting on a couple of chunks of wood that were atop the platform, keeping it out of the water. They had seen a bear roaming around not long ago, and even though she had heard that bears only attacked when provoked, there was no harm in being ready if something happened.  
明日香缓缓沉入热水中。她带来的 M-4 卡宾枪搁在平台上的几块木头上，避免浸水。不久前他们看到一只熊在附近徘徊，尽管听说熊只有在被激怒时才会攻击，但做好准备以防万一总是无害的。

She sat quietly wondering about Shinji's erratic behavior of late. He had been keeping to himself a lot recently and she could not help but think that it was her fault. Had she made him feel uncomfortable with her loud boisterous enthusiasm? He would rather be away from her. Maybe he did not love her anymore.  
她静静地坐着，思考着真嗣近来的反常行为。他最近总是独来独往，她不禁觉得这是自己的错。是不是她过于热情的喧闹让他感到不适？他宁愿远离她。或许他已经不再爱她了。

She sighed and rose out of the water, soaping her skin, and washing slowly deliberately. With the exception of meals and sleeping at night, for the past few days he had been staying away from her, and it had her worried. Maybe it was nothing, but maybe it was everything. Maybe he was trying to figure something out for himself, and if that was the case, it would be best to just give him space so that he could do his thinking.  
她叹了口气，从水中站起身来，慢慢地、刻意地用肥皂涂抹着肌肤。除了用餐和夜间睡觉，过去几天他一直避开她，这让她感到担忧。也许这没什么，但也可能意味着一切。或许他正在为自己想通某些事情，如果是这样，最好还是给他一些空间，让他能够思考。

She finished washing, and sat back down in the water, letting the soap float away from her in the water.  
她洗完澡，重新坐回水中，任由肥皂在水面上漂走。

Shinji finished tracing the lines of the flames into the gold. But the lines were not enough. He took out the set of chisels he had collected in town a few days previous and set to work making the lines of the flames come to life in relief. It was hard work, and he had to be extra careful to make it look just like what he had envisioned. With the exception of a couple of flames that just did not look right, he did well. He shaved the excess gold off of both sides and as an after thought made several flames on both sides curl around the edge of the ring. He looked at the wall clock. It had been nearly an hour.  
真嗣完成了将火焰的线条刻入金子中。但仅凭线条还不够。他拿出前几天在镇上收集的一套凿子，开始让火焰的线条以浮雕的形式生动起来。这是艰苦的工作，他必须格外小心，以确保它看起来就像他想象中的那样。除了几处火焰看起来不太对劲外，他做得很好。他将多余的黄金从两边削去，并灵机一动，在戒指的两边各刻了几道环绕边缘的火焰。他看了看墙上的时钟，已经过去将近一个小时了。

It was very nice looking like that, unique in design and especially meaningful because he had made it specifically for her. This was not the creation of some unknown craftsman. This was a ring made by a boy who wanted to show his Asuka what he felt for her. The edges and peaks of the flames were still sharp so he took some fine silicone carbide sanding paper and smoothed off the sharp edges a little, making the ring's design flow more like water. Liquid flames dancing in an endless circle around it.  
它看起来非常漂亮，设计独特，尤其意义非凡，因为他特意为她制作了这枚戒指。这不是某个无名工匠的作品。这是一位男孩亲手打造的戒指，他想向他的明日香表达自己的心意。火焰的边缘和尖峰依然锋利，于是他拿起细粒碳化硅砂纸，轻轻打磨掉那些尖锐的棱角，让戒指的设计更加流畅，宛如水波荡漾。流动的火焰在无尽的圆环中舞动。

As a final touch, he put the ring in a clamp with cloth between it and the clamp. He had meant to etch something into the inside of the ring, and he stopped to think about what he should put. It took only minutes to decide, and with a shaky hand he carefully etched five words into the semi soft metal.  
作为最后的点缀，他将戒指夹在带有布料的夹具中。他本打算在内侧刻上些什么，于是停下来思考该刻什么内容。只用了几分钟就决定了，他颤抖着手，小心翼翼地在半软的金属上刻下了五个字。

When he was done with it, he wrapped the ring in a small piece of cloth and put it in a little cardboard box that she would never suspect. Then he cleaned up his mess, raked up all of the gold flecks and put things back in their place.  
完成后，他用一小块布将戒指包裹起来，放入一个她绝不会怀疑的小纸盒中。接着，他清理了工作台，收集起所有的金屑，并将物品归回原位。

Asuka had still not come back yet, so he wrote a quick note and then went outside to the 4-wheel drive to make another quick trip into town.  
明日香还没有回来，于是他匆匆写下一张字条，然后走出屋外，坐上四驱车，再次快速驶向城镇。

---

Asuka heard the truck drive away, and sadly wondered if Shinji had finally left her. She didn't know why she had sunk into this semi-depression, leading every thought with a pessimistic view. He wasn't leaving her. He wouldn't do that to her. They needed each other right?  
明日香听到卡车驶离的声音，心中不禁悲伤地想，真嗣是否终于离开了她。她不明白自己为何陷入了这种半抑郁的状态，每一种想法都带着悲观的色彩。他不会离开她的。他不会那样对她。他们需要彼此，对吧？

She stood, and let herself drip for a minute in the frigid air. The sudden difference in temperature was always exhilarating, but today, it just brought to mind the coldness of the lonely feelings she had felt before she had her Shinji.  
她站起身，在寒冷的空气中让水滴落了一会儿。温差的突然变化总是令人振奋，但今天，这却让她想起了在拥有真嗣之前所感受到的孤独的寒冷。

She walked back and dried and dressed, quickly jumping into clean clothes, then racing the snowmobile back up to the house. After grabbing all of her stuff, and covering the vehicle, she went inside to find Shinji's note on the table.  
她走回来擦干身体并穿上衣服，迅速换上干净衣物，然后驾驶雪地摩托疾驰回屋。拿齐所有物品并遮好车辆后，她进屋发现桌上留着真嗣的字条。

_Asuka, 明日香，_

_I have run into town for a few minutes to get some things. I should be back in a little while. I hope you had a nice bath, and I did not come down to peek at you, although I would have liked to. Be back soon.  
我进城一会儿买点东西。应该很快回来。希望你泡了个舒服的澡，虽然我很想偷看，但没下来。很快回来。_

_I love you 我爱你_

_Shinji 真嗣_

She read the last part over again, savoring the final four words. He did still love her. Her stomach rumbled a little, and she cut several slices of cheese to tide her over till lunch. They had found the cheese at a shop in town. It was good cheese, coated in paraffin, not the imitation stuff. Asuka had been a little apprehensive about it at first, but it was good cheese.  
她再次读了一遍最后部分，细细品味着那最后的四个字。他确实依然爱着她。她的肚子咕噜作响，于是切了几片奶酪，以撑到午饭时间。他们在镇上的一家店里找到了这种奶酪。这是真正的奶酪，涂着石蜡，不是那种仿制品。起初，明日香对此有些疑虑，但最终证实这是好奶酪。

What had started out a sunny morning was starting to darken a little bit, as it grew overcast. In a while, the four-wheel drive truck rumbled back up the driveway, and parked in the garage. A few minutes later Shinji came through the door. Asuka had been expecting him to come in with some things in hand, but apparently he did not have anything.  
原本阳光明媚的早晨开始变得有些阴沉，天空逐渐布满云层。不久，四驱卡车轰鸣着驶回车道，停进了车库。几分钟后，真嗣推门而入。明日香本以为他会带些东西回来，但显然他什么也没拿。

"I thought you were going to pick some things up."  
“我以为你会去取些东西。”

"Um, yeah, I could not find what I needed."  
"呃，是的，我找不到我需要的东西。"

"What did you need?" She popped another piece of cheese in her mouth.  
"你需要什么？" 她又往嘴里塞了一块奶酪。"

"Well, you know. I wanted to get some books to read cause I am getting bored sometimes." Asuka saw that he was grasping at straws. He hadn't expected to be questioned when he got home. And why should be. He had the right to go wherever he pleased right? Of course, she pretty well knew what this was all about now. He must have gone and picked her up a present for her birthday tomorrow or something. She was dense sometimes, but she was not galactically stupid.  
"嗯，你知道的。我想找些书来读，因为我有时候会感到无聊。" 明日香看出他在找借口。他没想到回家会受到盘问。他难道不应该有权去任何他想去的地方吗？当然，她现在大致猜到了这是怎么回事。他一定是去给她挑了份明天的生日礼物之类的。她有时反应慢，但并不至于完全没脑子。"

"Oh. OK. You didn't bring anything back with you?" She asked looking him over.  
"哦。好吧。你没带什么东西回来吗？" 她打量着他问道。

"Fraid not. Are you getting hungry." Shinji quickly shifted gears to get off the subject.  
"恐怕没有。你饿了吗？" 真嗣迅速转移话题。

"I was, but I think I can wait a while now. I had some cheese."  
"本来有点饿，不过现在我觉得可以再等等。我吃了些奶酪。"

It was early afternoon, and Shinji set about making oatmeal cookies in the kitchen while Asuka busied herself with housework. She had been taking it easy the last couple of days, just so she could be lazy a little. But clothes had piled up and the place had gotten a little bit messy.  
时值午后，真嗣在厨房忙着做燕麦饼干，而明日香则忙于家务。她最近几天都放慢了节奏，只是为了能偷点懒。但衣物堆积如山，家里也变得有些凌乱。

The lights flickered a few times as the electricity shut off and the UPS took over. Then the power would come back. One time during the last two months, they had gone up to the wind turbines because the power had stayed off for more than 4 hours. If it did not come back on soon, the UPS might not support them much longer. It had turned out that they were having a difficult time dealing with the snow, but with the help of some colder weather oil they had managed to get the three they were using back up and running again. There were 27 of them spread out over the ridgelines in the area. If they only used three they would have many spares if they broke or were somehow unable to produce power.  
灯光闪烁了几下，电力中断后由不间断电源接管。随后电力又恢复了。过去两个月里，有一次停电超过 4 小时，他们不得不爬上风力涡轮机查看。如果电力不尽快恢复，不间断电源可能支撑不了多久。原来他们一直在与积雪作斗争，但在一些低温天气油的协助下，他们设法让正在使用的三台风力涡轮机重新运转起来。这些涡轮机共有 27 台，分布在山脊线上。如果只使用三台，即便其中某台损坏或无法发电，他们还有许多备用的。

Once Shinji was done with the cookies, he let them cool as he started an early dinner. Tonight they had pork stir fry with frozen vegetables that they had managed to pick from a farm not far away. The pungent smell of soy sauce and onions and peppers flowed throughout the house and stung her nose.  
当真嗣把饼干做完后，他让它们冷却，同时开始准备晚餐。今晚他们有猪肉炒菜搭配从附近农场挑选的冷冻蔬菜。浓郁的酱油、洋葱和辣椒的香味弥漫在整个屋子里，刺激着她的鼻子。

Shinji loaded the rice cooker and let the main course simmer for a few minutes while he came over, and draped his arms over Asuka shoulders from behind, and lightly kissed her on the neck. Asuka yelped as he lightly bit her earlobe, and turned around and playfully hit him. The brief distraction afforded him the chance to relax with her for a moment. He had been worrying over her birthday for a while now, and had almost forgotten what it was like.  
真嗣装好电饭煲，让主菜炖煮几分钟，然后走过来，从背后环抱住明日香的肩膀，轻轻吻了她的脖子。明日香被他轻咬耳垂时惊叫一声，转身笑着打了他一下。这短暂的打岔让他有机会和她一起放松片刻。他一直为她的生日操心，几乎忘记了那种感觉。

The bell on the rice cooker dinged and it switched from its cooking mode to its warming mode. Asuka got up and set the table, smacking Shinji rather hard on the butt on her way to the cabinets.  
电饭煲的铃声响起，从烹饪模式切换到保温模式。明日香起身摆桌子，路过时重重地拍了一下真嗣的屁股，走向橱柜。

When the rice was ready, Shinji spread in evenly on the plates, and spooned the pork stir fry on top of it. They talked a little about this and that, not really caring much about the topic, until Asuka asked Shinji what he did all day. He gave her several "umms" and stutters, but effectively evaded the question. Asuka smiled to herself. He must have picked her up something for her birthday all right. Regardless of what it was, she was touched that he was trying so hard to surprise her. She would have to act surprised when he gave it to her.  
米饭煮好后，真嗣均匀地铺在盘子上，然后用勺子将炒猪肉盖在上面。他们随意聊着一些无关紧要的话题，并不真正在意内容，直到明日香问真嗣他一整天都在做什么。他支支吾吾地回答，但巧妙地避开了问题。明日香暗自微笑。他一定为她准备了生日礼物。不管是什么，她都被他的努力所感动，想要给她一个惊喜。当真嗣送给她时，她得装出惊喜的样子。

After the table was cleaned off they settled back to watch a DVD that they had gotten for the TV/DVD combination that they had hooked up. It was an action movie, and it appealed to Asuka, but Shinji was interested more in the girl he had sitting next to him. She pretended to be interested in the movie, tormenting the boy, but she kept him interested in her easily enough. Show a little skin in certain places, and you can glue a boy in place for hours.  
收拾完桌子后，他们坐回来看他们连接好的电视/DVD 组合上的一张 DVD。这是一部动作片，很合明日香的胃口，但真嗣更关注坐在他旁边的女孩。她假装对电影感兴趣，逗弄着男孩，但她轻而易举地让他对她保持兴趣。在某些地方稍微露点肌肤，就能让一个男孩几个小时都动弹不得。

While the hero kicked and punched his way to freedom from the crime syndicates clutches, Asuka almost let her shirt fall open enough to see a whole breast, and she had Shinji's full undivided attention. It was hilarious to watch, but she almost felt bad for doing it. Shinji leaned closer, and whispered to her.  
当英雄踢打摆脱犯罪集团的魔爪时，明日香几乎让她的衬衫敞开到足以露出整个胸部，而她完全吸引了真嗣的全部注意力。这场景既滑稽又让她几乎感到有些内疚。真嗣凑近了些，低声对她说。

"Why do you do that to me."  
“你为什么要这样对我。”

Asuka gave her most sinister smile. "If it's so bad, then you are a glutton for punishment. I think you like it." He did like it, and so far as he was concerned, there was nothing wrong with it. He wondered when he starting liking things like that so much.  
明日香露出她最邪恶的微笑。“如果这让你觉得不好，那你就是自找苦吃。我觉得你喜欢这样。”他的确喜欢，而且在他看来，这没什么不对。他开始思考自己何时变得如此喜欢这类事情。

They cuddled together and tried to make sense out of the last 10 minutes of the movie where the final fight occurred and somehow beating the hell out of 50 people could be shown to contain moral value.  
他们依偎在一起，试图理解电影最后十分钟里发生的终极战斗，不知怎的，痛打 50 个人竟然能体现出道德价值。

With a lack of useful things that they could accomplish at night, they had started going to bed much earlier, of course both teens found that the extra sleep did wonders for how they felt all day.  
由于夜晚没有什么有用的事情可做，他们开始早早上床睡觉，当然，两个青少年都发现额外的睡眠对他们一整天的感觉大有裨益。

Asuka had taken to sleeping in Shinji's room well enough. It took all the restraint the two frustrated teens could muster to keep from having sex each night, but to help cope, they made up for it with what could be termed as heavy petting. Either way, this activity certainly made the nights more bearable than they had previously been for either one of them. Where their nights had once been lonely and cold, now they were exciting and wonderful.  
明日香已经习惯了睡在真嗣的房间里。两个备受煎熬的青少年每晚都竭尽全力克制自己不要发生性关系，但为了应对，他们用所谓的激烈爱抚来弥补。无论如何，这种活动确实让夜晚比以前更能忍受，对他们中的任何一个来说，曾经孤独而寒冷的夜晚，现在变得激动人心且美妙。

It was after one such episode of this action that Shinji waited for Asuka to fall asleep, then he slipped out from under the covers, and ventured to the garage to retrieve several items. It took a while to prepare them, and get everything ready for the next day.  
在一次这样的行动之后，真嗣等待着明日香入睡，随后他悄悄从被窝中溜出，冒险前往车库取回几样物品。他花了些时间准备它们，并为第二天做好一切准备。

### Chapter 11 Day147

Acknowledging Tex and Dennisud once again. You guys rock. Thanks for your help.  
再次感谢 Tex 和 Dennisud。你们太棒了。感谢你们的帮助。

---
Asuka opened her eyes to the bright light of day. The light streamed in through the windows illuminating the room with a few wispy snow flakes lazily floating by. The space next to her was empty of the Shinji that usually slept there. It was cold so he had been up for some time. She sat up, and that was when she saw it.  
明日香睁开双眼，迎接明媚的晨光。阳光透过窗户洒进房间，几片轻飘飘的雪花悠闲地飘过。她身旁的空位通常是真嗣的睡处，如今却空无一人，冰冷异常，显然他已经起床多时。她坐起身来，就在这时，她看到了它。

It hung on a cross shaped hanger, holding the sleeves out straight. The kimono was brightly colored with lots of warm tones of red and yellow. It was a flowery pattern with butterflies on it too. The sleeves were long, almost coming down past her knees, and the belt that accompanied it was a deep blue that added stark contrast to the ensemble.  
它挂在一个十字形的衣架上，袖子笔直展开。这件和服色彩鲜艳，充满了温暖的红色和黄色调。图案繁花似锦，还点缀着蝴蝶。袖子很长，几乎垂至她的膝盖，与之相配的腰带则是深蓝色，为整体增添了鲜明的对比。

Beneath the hanging garments was a small pamphlet that explained much about the traditional clothing of Japan. This particular style was called a furisode. The length of sleeves was indicative of her marital status, and the vibrant colors where more to show her age than anything else. The sash was called an obi. She examined it, and found that it was quite long, about 12 feet, and it was nearly a foot wide.  
悬挂的衣物下方是一本小册子，详细介绍了日本的传统服饰。这种特定款式被称为振袖。袖子的长度表明了她的婚姻状况，而鲜艳的色彩更多是为了展示她的年龄。腰带叫做带。她仔细观察，发现它相当长，约 12 英尺，宽度接近一英尺。

There was also a nagajuban, it explained, as well as a haori that would serve as underclothing. It illustrated how each piece was worn and gave step by step instructions on the placement of each layer and folded piece. Also there were instructions on how to tie the obi into different knots. Most of these were very elaborate, and Asuka could not even follow most of them. But there was an easy looking all purpose one that she figured she could manage.  
文中还提到了一件长衬衣和一件作为内衣的羽织褂。它详细展示了每一件的穿着方式，并逐步指导了每一层和折叠部分的摆放位置。此外，还有关于如何将腰带打成不同结扣的说明。其中大多数都非常复杂，连 Asuka 也难以掌握。但有一个看起来简单通用的结扣，她觉得自己应该能应付。

There was an empty hanger next to hers, that undoubtedly had held another kimono until a little while before. Shinji must have gotten up quite early to set all of this up for her. She had not expected him to get her clothes such as these. They were elegant and light, made out of top quality silk, and tailored to perfection. She disrobed, casting t-shirt and bra to the side, but she decided to at least wear underwear. The clothing covered everything else. The nagajuban was like a slip, covering her top half and hanging loose at the bottom. Over this she wore the haori, being careful to keep the left side over the right as per the instructions. A small sash kept it in place while she donned the furisode, arranging it similarly, then following the instructions on how to tie the simple yet not quite so simple knot about her waist. After several unsuccessful tries she got it right, and then turned the sash around so that the knot was at her back. She looked in the mirror and looked at her reflection.  
她的衣架旁空着一个挂钩，无疑不久前还挂着另一件和服。真嗣一定起得很早，为她精心准备了这一切。她没料到他会为她准备这样的衣物。它们优雅轻盈，由顶级丝绸制成，剪裁得恰到好处。她脱下 T 恤和胸罩，但决定至少穿上内衣。这些衣物遮盖了其余部分。长衬衣如同吊带裙，覆盖上半身，下摆宽松。她按照指示，将左襟搭在右襟上穿上外褂，并用一条小带子固定。接着她穿上振袖，同样仔细整理，然后按照说明系上那个看似简单实则不那么简单的腰结。尝试几次失败后，她终于成功了，随后将带子转了一圈，让结位于背后。她望向镜中的自己，凝视着那倒影。

She was surprised by it. She had expected to look out of place, even funny in the outfit, but it was well chosen for her. The blue brought out the color of her eyes. She turned around to see herself from different angles, and smiled at herself.  
她对此感到惊讶。她本以为自己穿上这身衣服会显得格格不入，甚至滑稽可笑，但事实证明这身装扮非常适合她。蓝色凸显了她的眼睛颜色。她转过身来，从不同角度打量自己，对着镜子中的自己微笑。

She leaped for the door to go see her Shinji. When she opened it, she found a pair of soft sandals waiting for her. After slipping her feet into them, she padded around to the kitchen to find Shinji. He was there cooking furiously. There was homemade sausage cooking as well as steamed onions, red cabbage, and baked potatoes in the oven. She caught the faint sugar smell that hung in the air too.  
她急忙冲向门口，想要去见她的新司。打开门时，她发现门口放着一双柔软的拖鞋。穿上拖鞋后，她轻手轻脚地走向厨房，寻找新司。他正在那里忙碌地烹饪。自制香肠、蒸洋葱、红甘蓝和烤土豆都在烤箱里。她还闻到了空气中淡淡的糖香。

Shinji was dressed in a dark blue kimono with a comparatively small tan sash wrapped around it tied in a simple knot. As she stepped into the room, Shinji turned around, a little surprised to see her. He had not expected her to be up for a while more.  
新司穿着一件深蓝色的和服，腰间系着一条相对较小的棕色腰带，打了个简单的结。当她走进房间时，新司转过身来，有些惊讶地看到她。他没想到她会这么快就起床。

Shinji smiled and looked at her for what seemed like an eternity, taking in her splendor. She was beautiful. He had judged well when he picked out her kimono. It was like it was made for her, and it fit very well. Her red hair hung down the back almost melding with the color of the fabric. Asuka turned around so that he could see all of her, the long hanging sleeves flowing loosely under her arms.  
真嗣微笑着，仿佛凝视了她一个世纪，沉醉于她的光彩。她美极了。他挑选和服时眼光独到，那件和服仿佛为她量身定做，非常合身。她那头红发垂至背后，几乎与布料的颜色融为一体。明日香转过身来，让他能一览无余，长长的袖子在她臂下随意飘动。

Asuka sniffed several times to break Shinji out of his inspection. "What are you cooking? That smells great."  
明日香几次轻嗅，试图打破真嗣的审视。“你在做什么菜？闻起来真香。”

"Well I figured that you were getting tired of Japanese food so I decided to make you something to remind you of home for your birthday." He lifted the lid of a pot to watch the red cabbage cooking.  
“我想你大概吃腻了日本料理，所以决定在你生日时做点让你想起家乡的东西。”他揭开锅盖，看着红甘蓝在烹饪中。

Asuka hugged him from behind. The silk of his own kimono was very smooth, and she ran her hands over his front and sides. "You doing all this for me?"  
明日香从背后抱住了他。他自己的和服丝绸非常光滑，她用手抚过他的前胸和两侧。“你为我做这一切吗？”

Shinji nodded. "By the way, this should be done in a little while, then I have a present for you. We can open that sometime later."  
真嗣点点头。“顺便说一下，这应该很快就好了，然后我有个礼物给你。我们可以晚些时候再打开。”

So the Kimonos where not the only thing he had gotten for her. She had not expected him to celebrate her birthday like this. Asuka seated herself at the table to watch the meal being prepared. She and Shinji talked a little, but she watched him with more attention than she was paying towards talking to him. He moved about the kitchen stirring this and cutting that, and tasting something else, smiling about it all the whole time.  
原来和服并不是他为她准备的唯一东西。她没想到他会这样庆祝她的生日。明日香坐在桌旁，看着真嗣准备饭菜。她和真嗣聊了几句，但她更多地是在注视着他，而不是在和他交谈。他在厨房里忙碌着，搅拌这个，切那个，尝尝别的，全程都面带微笑。

For one of the few times in his life, Shinji was happy, and he had been for several months now. Was this what contentment was? Being with someone you love, and only having to worry about your own welfare? To have everything you need and no worries about anything else. He had noticed that he liked watching the world recently. He would sit in the living room chair and watch the snow, just thinking about things. It was soothing. And there was a lot to think about.  
在一生中少有的几次里，真嗣感到幸福，而且这种感觉已经持续了好几个月。这就是满足感吗？与所爱的人在一起，只需担忧自己的福祉？拥有所需的一切，不再为其他任何事烦恼。他注意到自己最近喜欢观察世界。他会坐在客厅的椅子上，看着雪花，只是思考着各种事情。这很舒缓。而且有很多值得思考的东西。

Why were they here. Even though the fact that both of them were in Evas at the time, it was odd that there would be no one else around at all. Statistically speaking there should be people around. There are inevitably always people who will survive something right?  
为什么他们会在这里。尽管当时两人都在 EVA 里，但奇怪的是周围竟然没有其他人。从统计学上讲，应该会有人幸存下来。不是总会有幸存者吗？

So perhaps they were picked to stay behind. To do what? Repopulate? Begin again? And try to do so without nearly destroying the world again? But why start with only two? Was this some neo-biblical thing again? Adam and Eve? How could something so monumental be so cut and dried? He and Asuka were not like Adam and Eve. They both had memories of pre-Third impact life. Maybe they were to remind them of where humanity went wrong.  
所以也许他们是被选中的留下者。为了做什么？重新繁衍？重新开始？并试图避免再次几乎毁灭世界？但为什么只从两个人开始？这是某种新约圣经式的安排吗？亚当和夏娃？如此重大的事情怎么会如此简单明了？他和明日香不像亚当和夏娃。他们都有第三次冲击前生活的记忆。也许他们被留下来是为了提醒人类曾经走错了路。

Regardless, they were here and practicality stated that sooner or later they would run out of resources that they wanted or needed. Like gasoline for engines or other chemicals. Food would consume much of their time to grow and tend. And what about the technology that still littered the landscape? What would they do when things began breaking due to age and they could not repair it? They needed help of some kind.  
无论如何，他们已经在这里了，现实告诉他们迟早会耗尽他们想要或需要的资源。比如引擎用的汽油或其他化学品。种植和照料食物将占用他们大量时间。还有那些散布在景观中的技术呢？当东西因老化而开始损坏，而他们又无法修复时，他们该怎么办？他们需要某种帮助。

The timer on the stove dinged and Shinji shut off the heat. He had been so absorbed in his thoughts that he had lost track of time. Fortunately cooking came almost as second nature to him so he could think about things like that and cook at the same time.  
炉子上的计时器叮的一声响了，真嗣关掉了火。他沉浸在自己的思绪中，以至于忘记了时间。幸运的是，烹饪对他来说几乎是第二天性，所以他可以一边思考那些事情一边做饭。

Asuka had taken the initiative to put some dishes on the table, she was ready for some good German food. Shinji served it out in heaping helpings, and they both dug in. Shinji paused just long enough for a quick "Happy Birthday Asuka."  
明日香主动把一些餐具摆上了桌，她已经准备好享用一些美味的德国菜了。真嗣盛了满满几大勺，两人便开始大快朵颐。真嗣停顿了一下，快速说了句：“生日快乐，明日香。”

Shinji was not used to spicy or rich foods like this but it was good. Asuka was in heaven. It was cooked just like she had remembered it tasting, and it brought back memories of Hamburg and Berlin when she got the chance to eat out while in college. If she had not known better, she would swear that Shinji was a German cook. She complimented him on his cooking several times.  
真嗣并不习惯吃这种辛辣或油腻的食物，但味道确实不错。明日香则仿佛置身天堂。这菜做得和她记忆中的味道一模一样，让她回想起在汉堡和柏林上大学时外出就餐的时光。如果不是更了解情况，她几乎要以为真嗣是个德国厨师了。她多次称赞他的厨艺。

When they were finished the stuffed teens sat eyeing the empty plates, wondering how they managed to eat it all. Shinji rose, and cleared the table, then let them sit in water so that he could wash them later.  
饱餐一顿后，两个年轻人坐在那里，盯着空盘子，疑惑自己是怎么把它们一扫而光的。真嗣起身收拾桌子，然后让他们坐在水里，以便稍后清洗。

Asuka felt about ready to pop. "I don't think I am going to need anything else to eat for another 2 weeks." She half expected to see a huge round belly when she looked down, so much food had she put in there.  
明日香感觉自己快要撑爆了。“我想我接下来两周都不需要再吃任何东西了。”她低头一看，半期待着能看到一个巨大的圆滚滚的肚子，因为她吃了那么多食物。

"Well, after you let that settle for a while, I have a cake that we can have. I made it for just the two of us, so we don't have to worry about leftovers. Asuka groaned. It would be forever before she could eat that cake. Right now she was digesting the biggest meal of her life, and she was getting drowsy despite the night of sleep she had last night. She related that to Shinji, and they decided to sit and watch it snow.  
"好吧，让这些先消化一会儿，我有个蛋糕我们可以吃。我是特意为我们俩做的，所以不用担心剩菜。明日香叹了口气。她要很久才能吃那个蛋糕。现在她正在消化她这辈子最大的一顿饭，尽管昨晚睡了一整夜，她还是开始犯困了。她把这情况告诉了真嗣，他们决定坐下来欣赏雪景。"

"Asuka? You ever think about what were doing here?"  
"明日香？你有没有想过我们在这里做什么？"

"All the time. What's on your mind?"  
"经常想。你在想什么呢？"

"Do you... I mean, what do you think about... kids?" Shinji blushed a terrible red. It was very evident that such a subject was embarrassing to him.  
"你...我是说，你怎么看待...孩子？" 真嗣的脸红得厉害。很明显，这个话题让他感到尴尬。

"Well, I think bout that a lot, yeah. Do you think I would be ashamed of having children?"  
"嗯，我确实经常想这个问题，是的。你觉得我会因为生孩子而感到羞愧吗？"

"No." Shinji paused for a moment. "I just remember you commenting that you did not want children when we were pilots. And I just wanted to know what you thought about having kids with... someone like me."  
"不。" 真嗣停顿了一下。"我只是记得你当我们是驾驶员时说过不想要孩子。我只是想知道，你对于和我这样的人...生孩子有什么想法。"

Asuka knew how much it took him to say something like that so bluntly. It was a bit of a thrill that he would want to have a child with her. Thinking about that was sometimes something that she had no idea how to understand. That two people could make another person, and that person would be a part of each parent. The idea, when you just get right down to it was unfathomable. It would take experience to allow her to know what it was to be a mother. She smiled at her Shinji. "Shinji, I sure do love you. You may have a hard time of broaching difficult subjects, but you do care more than anyone I have known. I haven't even thought of having children with someone other than you.." She tried to drop her smile and look serious, but it did not work well. Instead she just had this silly grin on, and Shinji nodded and smiled back.  
"明日香知道，他能如此直白地说出这样的话，需要多大的勇气。他愿意和她一起拥有一个孩子，这让她感到一丝兴奋。有时候，她真的不知道该如何理解这个想法：两个人可以创造出另一个生命，而这个生命将属于他们双方。深入思考这个概念，实在是难以想象。她需要经历才能明白成为母亲意味着什么。她对着真嗣微笑。“真嗣，我真的很爱你。虽然你处理棘手话题时可能有些困难，但你比我所认识的任何人都更在乎。我从未想过和别人生孩子，除了你……”她试图收起笑容，装出严肃的样子，但并不成功。她只是露出了傻笑，而真嗣点头回应，也笑了。”

Perhaps teens such as they really could not grasp concepts such as these. To be responsible for another's life and well being as well as their future. Shinji and Asuka both were no strangers to being responsible for other people lives but it was altogether different when that person would be your child.  
或许像他们这样的青少年真的无法完全理解这些概念。对另一个人的生命、幸福以及未来负责。真嗣和明日香都曾对别人的生命负责，但当那个人是你的孩子时，一切就截然不同了。

As they talked the snow would quit falling only to resume a few minutes later. It was light but steadily it recovered much of the ground that had begun showing through the melted spots. The topic of conversation changed gradually from children to the future, to what they would do. Asuka proposed the idea that they could try going to Germany.  
他们交谈时，雪花时而停歇，几分钟后又继续飘落。虽然轻盈，但持续地覆盖了那些融化后显露出来的地面。话题逐渐从孩子转向未来，他们将要做些什么。明日香提议他们可以尝试去德国。

"Why did you want to go back there?"  
“你为什么想回到那里？”

"It's been a while since I have seen my home. I just wanted to see it. And besides they have one of the higher end MAGI there. We could use that to get all of the information that we have been wanting. Like how to work all of these things and how other stuff functions. I would be surprised if one of the branches did not have information like that in its database."  
“我已经很久没见过我的家了。我只是想看看它。而且那里有一台高端的 MAGI 系统。我们可以利用它获取我们一直想要的信息，比如如何操作这些设备，以及其他事物的运作原理。如果某个分支没有这类信息，我会感到惊讶的。”

"But that is a long way, how would we get there?" Even though the idea of another traveling adventure appealed to him, it was much further than from Tokyo-3 to Okayama had been.  
“但那地方很远，我们怎么去呢？”尽管再次踏上旅行冒险的想法吸引着他，但那比从第三新东京市到冈山远多了。

"I don't suppose you know how to fly?" Asuka said hopefully.  
“我想你不会飞吧？”明日香满怀希望地说。

Shinji shook his head. "Only what I've seen in movies. And I crash a lot in simulators." Asuka grimaced at that.  
真嗣摇了摇头。“我只从电影里看过。而且我在模拟器里总是坠机。”明日香听到这个皱了皱眉。

"Yeah, same here. That leaves going by boat."  
"是啊，我也是这么想的。那就只能乘船了。"

"Do you mean a sail boat or a powerboat?"  
"你是说帆船还是机动船？"

"Well originally I was thinking about a powerboat, but we would have to stop all the time to refuel, and it would take a while at each place to get the fuel. I have sailed a little before, nothing as big as an open water boat, and certainly not as far as we are talking."  
"嗯，原本我考虑的是机动船，但我们得频繁停下来加油，每次加油都要花不少时间。我以前稍微玩过帆船，不过都是小型的，远没有我们说的这种开阔水域的大船，更别提这么远的航程了。"

Shinji considered this. He had been sailing a little bit himself. When he had been in school they had gone on a field trip to the ocean and they went sailing there. "How did you plan on getting there?"  
真嗣思考了一下。他自己也稍微尝试过航海。在学校时，他们曾去海边进行了一次实地考察，并在那里体验了帆船。“你打算怎么去那里？”

"Well really at first I thought that we could just sail to China, then go overland the rest of the way, but that would take forever, plus we would get lost a lot cause we don't know anything about the area. But, if we sail to say, Italy, we could then go overland north through Europe, and be there in no time. Longest part would be sailing there."  
“其实一开始我想我们可以直接航行到中国，然后陆路走完剩下的路程，但那样会花很长时间，而且我们会迷路很多次，因为我们对这个地区一无所知。不过，如果我们航行到意大利，然后从那里陆路北上穿越欧洲，就能很快到达。最长的部分就是航行过去。”

"How long are we talking? I don't really know anything about sailing long distances."  
“我们说的是多长时间？我对长途航行不太了解。”

Asuka thought for a moment. It would not be really fast going. Certainly not a mater of days. "Maybe 2 months or more?"  
明日香思索片刻。这不会真的很快。当然不是几天的事。“也许两个月或更久？”

"On a ship?" Shinji sounded skeptical. Asuka nodded. "Alone?" Asuka nodded again. "Won't we get cabin fever or something? And what about food?"  
“坐船？”真嗣听起来有些怀疑。明日香点头。“就我们俩？”明日香再次点头。“我们不会得幽闭恐惧症之类的吗？还有食物怎么办？”

"No fresh vegetables for a while. We could fish. And we could bring cooking stuff with us."  
“一段时间没有新鲜蔬菜了。我们可以钓鱼。而且我们可以带上烹饪用具。”

"We could find a good-sized boat that would have a fridge and freezer."  
"我们可以找一艘大小适中的船，配有冰箱和冰柜。"

"Shinji do you really want to do it? I mean I would hate to drag you along if you didn't want to go."  
"真嗣，你真的想这么做吗？我是说，如果你不想去的话，我可不想勉强你。"

Shinji thought about it only for a second before responding. He wanted to see more of the world. There was so much that he had not seen and yet so much out there to see. "Lets do it." Being stuck in the house for the winter was bad enough to make him long to be out and about. He'd had quite a bit fun traveling even the relatively short distance to Okayama.  
真嗣只思考了一会儿就回答了。他想看看更大的世界。还有那么多他未曾见过的，以及外面等待探索的广阔天地。“我们走吧。”整个冬天被困在家里已经够糟糕了，让他渴望外出活动。即便是相对较短的到冈山的旅程，他也玩得很开心。

Asuka brightened and started talking about the route that she had been thinking about. They could sail west from Japan through the Indian Ocean, around Saudi Arabia and its satellites and through the Suez Canal after going through the Red Sea. Then just a short trip across the Mediterranean Sea, and they could land in Italy.  
明日香眼睛一亮，开始讲述她构思的航线。他们可以从日本向西航行，穿过印度洋，绕过沙特阿拉伯及其附属地区，穿过红海后通过苏伊士运河。然后只需横跨地中海，就能抵达意大利。

"Do you think we could have some of that cake? I have some room now." Asuka was curious as to what kind of cake it was.  
“你觉得我们可以吃点那种蛋糕吗？我现在有点胃口了。”明日香好奇那是什么样的蛋糕。

"OK, but don't expect to be too impressed. I did not spend too much time on it, and it only has a little icing on it."  
“好的，但别期待太高。我没花太多时间做它，上面也只有一点点糖霜。”

"Stop right there. By the time you finish telling me about it, it'll have become the worst cake in history. I am sure it is great. Just gimme some."  
“停，别说了。等你讲完，这蛋糕估计都成史上最差了。我确信它很棒，直接给我来点吧。”

Shinji took the cake out of the fridge and cut it in half. It was very small. Big enough to make only two medium sized pieces. It was a vanilla cake with yellow lemon icing on it. There were even tiny specks of vanilla bean in the cake.  
真嗣从冰箱里拿出蛋糕，切成两半。它非常小，只够切成两块中等大小的份量。这是一块香草蛋糕，上面涂着黄柠檬糖霜，甚至还能看到蛋糕里点缀的香草籽。

While Asuka sat down at the table, Shinji went outside and retrieved a small flat flap-lid box. He had found it at a jewelry store, and put the ring in it. When he returned inside Asuka was waiting for him, having not yet taken a bite of her cake.  
当明日香坐在桌旁时，真嗣走到外面取回了一个小扁平的翻盖盒子。这是他在一家珠宝店找到的，他把戒指放了进去。当他回到屋内时，明日香正等着他，还未尝一口她的蛋糕。

He set the box on the table, not saying anything about it, but instead cutting a piece of cake and putting it in his mouth. He smiled when Asuka eyed the box, and then looked back at him. He knew that she was curious about it, but he wanted to let it be for a few more minutes.  
他将盒子放在桌上，对此只字未提，而是切了一块蛋糕送入口中。当明日香盯着盒子看时，他笑了，然后又看向他。他知道她对此感到好奇，但他想再等几分钟。

When the cake was gone, Shinji picked up the box, and placed it on the table in front of Asuka. "I umm... " He cleared his throat. " I made this for you. I hope you like it. Happy Birthday Asuka." He watched raptly as she slowly reached for the box, and lifted its cover. When she saw the ring she stared at it for a moment smiling.  
蛋糕吃完后，真嗣拿起盒子，放在明日香面前的桌上。“我...嗯...”他清了清嗓子，“这是我为你做的。希望你喜欢。生日快乐，明日香。”他目不转睛地看着她慢慢伸手去拿盒子，掀开盖子。看到戒指时，她微笑着凝视了一会儿。

"You made that? For me? Oh Shinji, I never did anything for you for your birthday." Her smile faded, and she was suddenly sad that she had never shown Shinji the level of appreciation or devotion that she herself had enjoyed from him.  
“这是你做的？给我的？哦，真嗣，我从未为你庆祝过生日。”她的笑容消失了，突然感到难过，因为她从未向真嗣展示过她从他那里享受到的那种感激或奉献。

Shinji stood up and moved next to her, turning her towards him and he took the ring from the box. He looked at her eyes as he found her left hand and he lifted the middle finger to place the ring on it. "Shinji? Would you put it on my ring finger instead?"  
真嗣站起身，移步到她身边，将她转向自己，从盒子里取出戒指。他注视着她的眼睛，找到她的左手，抬起中指准备将戒指戴上。“真嗣？你能把它戴在我的无名指上吗？”

Shinji hesitated only an instant, but in that time he thought volumes worth. What did this mean? That he was putting the ring on her ring finger? He knew that among couples it had special significance. Were they a couple? They were in love and they were together. Was she asking him to marry her? Or was she asking him to ask her to marry him? Or was this just a boy giving a ring that he made to the girl that he loves?  
真嗣只犹豫了一瞬间，但就在那片刻间，他的思绪翻涌。这意味着什么？将戒指戴在她的无名指上？他知道在情侣之间，这有着特殊的含义。他们是一对吗？他们相爱并在一起。是她要求他向她求婚吗？还是她希望他向她求婚？或者这只是男孩将自己制作的戒指送给心爱的女孩？

He looked into her eyes, as he pushed the ring slowly up her finger. It caught for an instant on her knuckle on a small fold of skin, then it was in place. "I love you, Asuka. Happy birthday." On an impulse he kissed her, and he instantly knew that it was the right thing to do.  
他凝视着她的眼睛，缓缓地将戒指推上她的手指。戒指在她的指关节处的小褶皱上卡了一下，随即稳稳地戴好了。“我爱你，明日香。生日快乐。”一时冲动，他吻了她，立刻明白这是正确的事。

Asuka hugged him, and buried her face in his neck. She vowed to do something special for his birthday next time. She would make it his special day just like he had made this one hers. The kimonos, the cake, the ring, it had all been carefully planned. When they let go of each other, she looked at the ring again. The flames licked at the edges, curling around in some places. It shone with it's yellow brown luster, and caught the light well. "Shinji? Why flames? Just out of curiosity."  
明日香紧紧抱住他，将脸埋在他的脖颈间。她发誓下次要为他准备一个特别的生日。她要让这一天像他为她所做的那样，成为他的特别日子。和服、蛋糕、戒指，这一切都是精心策划的。当他们松开彼此，她再次看向戒指。火焰在边缘跳跃，有些地方蜷曲着。它闪耀着黄褐色的光泽，很好地捕捉了光线。“真嗣？为什么是火焰？只是出于好奇。”

"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Look inside it."  
“哦，我忘了告诉你。看看里面。”

Asuka slowly pulled the ring off of her finger, and examined the inside. She had to move into better light, and then she saw it. "The fire in my life." She looked up at Shinji.  
明日香缓缓将戒指从手指上取下，仔细检查内部。她需要移到更好的光线下，然后她看到了。“我生命中的火焰。”她抬头看向真嗣。

"Well, you know. I have just come to think of you as my motivation. I don't know what I would do if I didn't have you and... You are the reason I do anything anymore. Without you, I would be... Existing."  
"嗯，你知道的。我刚刚开始把你当作我的动力。如果没有你，我不知道我会做什么...你是我现在做任何事情的理由。没有你，我只会...苟延残喘。"

Asuka had for a long time only lived for the praise of others. But praise on such a base idea as this was something that she had never known. To be loved and to inspire someone to be better than they are. Asuka knew that what Shinji had told her was true. To him, she was his reason for living. While the idea was flattering, it carried with it a sense of responsibility.  
长期以来，明日香只为别人的赞扬而活。但像这样基于某种想法的赞扬，她从未体验过。被爱并激励某人变得比他们自己更好。明日香知道真嗣告诉她的是真的。对她来说，他是她活下去的理由。虽然这个想法令人陶醉，但也带来了一种责任感。

Asuka slid the ring back on her finger, and hugged her Shinji again. "I have never had a better birthday, Shinji. My last birthday, I didn't even celebrate. I love you, baby."  
明日香重新戴上戒指，再次拥抱了真嗣。“这是我度过的最好的生日，真嗣。我上一个生日甚至都没庆祝。我爱你，宝贝。”

For the rest of the day they puttered about the house in their kimonos. They poured over an atlas they had found discussing possible routes they could take to get to Germany, they cleaned up the mess from the cake and the meal. Shinji went outside for a moment to check on the chickens and make sure things were running right around the house.  
一整天，他们都穿着和服在家里闲逛。他们翻阅着找到的一本地图集，讨论着前往德国可能的路线，清理了蛋糕和餐食留下的残局。真嗣还出门片刻，检查了鸡舍，确保家中一切运转正常。

He carried the .38 special with him nearly everywhere now. It was snub-nosed, and could fit easily into a pocket if he needed to. They had heard the dogs several times in the last few months, and Asuka had even shot at them once. Fortunately Shinji did not have to use it today. The UPS showed in the green, the chickens were fed and watered, the pipes looked good, and the LP gas tank was only down to ¾ tank.  
现在他几乎走到哪儿都带着那把.38 口径的特殊手枪。枪身短小，必要时可以轻松放入口袋。过去几个月里，他们多次听到狗叫声，甚至有一次明日香还开枪吓唬过它们。幸运的是，真嗣今天没有用到它。UPS 显示一切正常，鸡喂了水也喂了食，管道状况良好，液化气罐也只消耗了四分之三。

Once their work was done, they relaxed and talked for a while, and then it was time for bed. During the winter, they had both noticed that since the days were so short, they had started going to bed earlier and waking up later. So it was not so uncommon for them to be going to bed at 8:00.  
工作完成后，他们放松下来聊了一会儿，随后就到了睡觉时间。冬天里，他们注意到由于白天很短，他们开始早睡晚起。所以晚上八点就寝对他们来说并不罕见。

Of course, going to bed is a loose term. More so, it was going to the bedroom. They had not had a fight in a few days and it was high time they had one. Shinji had found long ago that Asuka liked to wrestle and she was pretty darn good at it too. So he made sure that the "fight" turned into a wrestling match. It started just like it always did. Words exchanged, voices raised, then Shinji moved it up a notch when he started trying to get Asuka down on the ground. And from there it only got better.  
当然，“上床”这个词用得有些随意。更确切地说，是进卧室。他们已经好几天没吵架了，是时候来一场了。真嗣早就发现明日香喜欢摔跤，而且她还相当擅长。所以他确保这场“争吵”演变成了一场摔跤比赛。一切如常开始，言语交锋，声调升高，接着真嗣加大了力度，试图把明日香按倒在地。从那以后，事情只会变得更加精彩。

Asuka managed to get both of his wrists out to the sides, then let go of one in the hopes that she could get around him in time to bring the remaining one up behind his back. But Shinji had been in this position before, and so sacrificing personal comfort he quickly ducked his head under his arm, and came around with her arm coming across his chest. With her hand sliding around the circumference of his wrist, it stretched the skin a little and it burned fiercely. She was still behind him which left her in prime pull-over body-slamming posture. He always had trouble getting a hold of something other than hair, but this time he was lucky. She had taken off her kimono and put on a shirt and shorts. He reached up with his free hand and grabbed a wad of shirt, and yanked her over, but she rolled to the side at the last moment and tripped him up, causing him to fall face down on the futon. And now he was in trouble. No sooner did he try to get up, but he felt her applying weight to his back.  
明日香设法将他的双腕向两侧挣脱，随即松开一只，希望能及时绕到他身后，将剩下的那只手反扣在他背上。但真嗣曾身处此境，于是他牺牲个人舒适，迅速低头从臂下钻过，转身时她的手臂横扫过他的胸膛。她的手滑过他腕部的周长，皮肤被拉扯得生疼。她仍在他身后，这使她处于绝佳的过肩摔姿势。他总是难以抓住除了头发以外的东西，但这次他很幸运。她脱下了和服，换上了衬衫和短裤。他用空着的那只手抓住一团衬衫，猛地将她拽过，但她却在最后一刻侧身一滚，绊倒了他，使他脸朝下摔在榻榻米上。现在他陷入了困境。他刚想爬起来，就感到她压在了他的背上。

He had grown more muscular, but there was no way he was going to move Asuka off his back. Especially now that she was putting her knee into the small of it. It hurt, and he knew he was lost, but that was OK. This was her day, let her have it. Asuka leaned down to whisper something in his ear, but bit it instead, and the fight was on again.  
他变得更为健壮，但无论如何也不可能把明日香从背上甩下来。特别是现在她把膝盖顶在他的腰眼上。这很疼，他知道自己已经输了，但这没关系。今天是属于她的日子，让她尽情享受吧。明日香俯身似乎要对他耳语些什么，却突然咬住了他的耳朵，战斗再次爆发。

A while later, exhausted, both teens lay in bed, just listening to each other breathing. Asuka wished that she could show Shinji how much she loved him, but for now it had to wait. They could not risk the repercussions of a decision like that at this point. It would not do to be tied down with a child with so much left to do to prepare for a family, assuming they would ever have one.  
过了一会儿，筋疲力尽的两人躺在床上，只是静静地听着对方的呼吸声。明日香希望她能向真嗣展示自己有多爱他，但眼下只能等待。他们不能在这个时候冒险承担那样的决定所带来的后果。在为家庭做准备还有那么多事情要做的情况下，不能因为一个孩子而束缚住手脚，假设他们将来会有一个家庭的话。

It was with thoughts like this that Asuka fell asleep. It had been one of the happiest days of her life, and she looked forward to many more like it next to her man.  
带着这样的思绪，明日香进入了梦乡。这是她一生中最快乐的日子之一，她期待着未来能与她的男人共度更多这样的时光。

Addendum 附录

A word about Kimonos. I am sure that most people who have watched at least a miniscule amount of anime with kimonos in it can grasp the idea of the kimonos that I described in the above chapter. If you are one of the unfortunate ones who think that the kimono entails only the thin single layer silk robes that are sold in the west you might check out Wikipedia on the subject.  
关于和服的一点说明。我相信大多数看过至少一点点包含和服的动漫的人都能理解我在上述chapter中描述的和服概念。如果你是那些不幸认为和服只包括西方出售的单层薄丝绸长袍的人之一，你可能需要查阅一下维基百科上的相关内容。

### Chapter 12 Day XXX

Just a side note: DAY XXX is just that I don't know what day it is and X is as good a variable as any other. There is no lemony content here... Without further ado...  
只是顺便提一下：DAY XXX 只是表示我不知道具体是哪一天，X 和其他变量一样，是个不错的占位符。这里并没有柠檬味的内容……废话不多说……

Asuka opened her eyes and squinted against the painfully bright light streaming in through the window above her. The gentle rocking motion had already put her back to sleep several times and it was high time she finally got up. The absence of a certain boy who normally slept beside her piqued her curiosity. Where was Shinji?  
明日香睁开眼睛，眯着眼对抗从上方窗户倾泻进来的刺眼阳光。那轻柔的摇晃已经让她多次陷入沉睡，是时候该真正起床了。平时睡在她身旁的某个男孩不见了，这引起了她的好奇。真嗣去哪儿了？

She rolled out of the bed, and stumbled around for a moment or two trying to get her footing, and started getting dressed. The cold of the hard wood floor caused a shiver to run up her body. Once she finished dressing she went out to look for Shinji. After only a couple of minutes, though, she found him. He was sitting on the deck, with only shorts on and a fishing pole dipped into the water.  
她从床上滚下来，踉跄了一会儿才站稳脚跟，开始穿衣服。硬木地板的寒冷让她全身一颤。穿好衣服后，她出去找真嗣。不过只过了几分钟，她就找到了他。他正坐在甲板上，只穿着短裤，手里拿着钓竿浸在水里。

Asuka yawned loudly so as to announce her approach, and sat down next to Shinji. "Whatcha up to.?  
明日香大声打了个哈欠，以此宣告她的到来，并坐在真嗣旁边。"你在干嘛呢？

Shinji smiled at her. "You know I think the first thing you say to me every morning is a redundant question or statement."  
真嗣朝她微笑。“你知道吗，我觉得你每天早上跟我说的第一句话总是多余的问句或陈述。”

"Hey, what can I say? Catch anything yet?"  
“嘿，我能说什么呢？钓到什么了吗？”

Shinji smiled again. "Not yet." He sighed slowly. "I like this. It's relaxing." Asuka gave him a weird look. "Not that there is anything terribly stressful going on right now."  
真嗣再次微笑。“还没有。”他缓缓叹了口气。“我喜欢这样。很放松。”明日香给了他一个奇怪的眼神。“并不是说现在有什么特别紧张的事情发生。”

"Well, I hope we get something soon, I am starved." Shinji nodded. So was he. Abruptly Asuka stood. "I am going to go update the log."  
"嗯，希望我们很快能找到吃的，我饿坏了。" 真嗣点头。他也是。突然，明日香站了起来。"我去更新日志。"

"Alright. Don't forget to resync that GPS. For some reason it keeps falling behind on the time."  
"好的。别忘了重新同步那个 GPS。不知怎么的，它的时间总是落后。"

"K" Asuka padded back down the stairs and went below where she sat at the table and worked. Their log tracked their journey so far and kept detailed information about all aspects. Before she started writing she had the GPS tracker get the current time from the satellite that kept nearly atomic accurate time. Then she checked the series of gauges that showed barometric pressure, wind speed and direction.  
"知道了" 明日香踏着楼梯走下去，来到下面她坐在桌前开始工作。他们的日志记录了迄今为止的旅程，并详细记录了各个方面的信息。在开始书写之前，她让 GPS 追踪器从保持近乎原子钟精确时间的卫星获取当前时间。然后她检查了一系列显示气压、风速和风向的仪表。

Day 12: 9:45 AM. Partly cloudy, wind approx. 10 miles per hour from SSE. Pressure is 30.04 in. and steady. According to GPS since last log entry, we have traveled nearly 300 nautical miles. Expect to put in tomorrow at Colombo, Sri Lanka or Nagercoil, India.  
第 12 天：上午 9:45。局部多云，风速约每小时 10 英里，来自南南东。气压为 30.04 英寸，稳定。根据 GPS 自上次记录以来，我们已航行近 300 海里。预计明天抵达斯里兰卡的科伦坡或印度的纳格科伊尔。

Asuka wrote a little about how she felt and how she was enjoying the trip so far. Not long after, Shinji walked down the stairs carrying a large fish of some sort or other by the gills. He cleaned it on the counter top while she continued to write. It was good to have a chance to relax again. They had spent quite a bit of time getting ready for this trip, and they had left as soon as they deemed it ready.  
明日香写了一些关于她此刻的心情以及她如何享受这次旅行的内容。不久后，真嗣拿着一条大鱼从楼梯走下来，鱼被他拎着鳃部。他在料理台上清理鱼，而她继续写着。能再次有机会放松真是太好了。他们为这次旅行做了很多准备，一旦觉得准备妥当就立刻出发了。

It had taken several weeks for them to locate a ship that they liked. Most of the vessels that had been moored in Okayama were fishing vessels and cargo ships. Not many yachts or passenger ships of a size that they could handle. With the help of the library (how would they ever have survived so far without it?) they learned quite a bit about ships in general, and sailboats in particular. They had then set out to nearby coastal towns on motorcycle and scouted around for different ones that would suit them. In the end it came down to three, and they picked the one that looked the nicest.  
他们花了好几周时间才找到一艘心仪的船。停在冈山的大多数是渔船和货船，能驾驭的游艇或客船并不多。多亏了图书馆（没有它，他们怎么可能走到现在？），他们学到了不少关于船只的知识，尤其是帆船。随后，他们骑着摩托车前往附近的沿海城镇，四处寻找合适的船只。最终，他们从三艘中选出了外观最漂亮的那一艘。

They sailed it from Ako, a town about 30 miles up the coast. Even that had been a bit of an adventure. Trying to steer a sail boat, and especially one of this size was as much an inborn ability as it was a science. They lazily made their way out of the harbor that evening zigzagging back and forth even with the wind at their back. Shinji had nearly knocked himself out on one of the sail booms too. He turned a little too sharply and the wind caught the sail and turned it. He ducked just in time for it to pass harmlessly overhead. From then on, they both kept a watchful eye on the sails position.  
他们从离海岸约 30 英里的赤穗市起航。即便如此，这也是一次小小的冒险。驾驶帆船，尤其是这种大小的帆船，既需要天赋也需要科学知识。那天傍晚，他们懒洋洋地驶出港口，即便顺风而行，也还是曲折前进。真嗣差点被一根帆桁撞晕。他转弯太急，风把帆吹转了方向，他及时蹲下，帆才从头顶无害地掠过。从那以后，他们都时刻留意着帆的位置。

Asuka stared out of the window next to the table and watched the water pass by. Nothing out there but miles and miles water in every direction. This was liberating in a way, but it also made her a bit anxious. They never strayed too far from shore. Even now she could not see the land itself, but there were large cumulus clouds hanging off the starboard horizon that indicated it was there. She thought back again to their days before setting sail.  
明日香凝视着桌子旁窗外，看着水流缓缓经过。四周尽是无边无际的水域，这种自由感在某种程度上令人振奋，但也让她有些不安。他们从未远离海岸太远。即便此刻她看不见陆地，但右舷地平线上悬挂着的大片积云预示着它的存在。她再次回想起出海前的那些日子。

It had been quite the hectic time. For weeks now they had been scouring the town of Okayama for any needed items that they could pack the boat with. The ship was large enough to pack quite a bit into. It had several sleep quarters, so they had taken out the beds and furniture from the unused quarters and used them for storage. The motorcycles (carefully packed of course), dry food staples, books, clothes, tools, outdoor gear, personal effects.  
那段时间相当忙碌。几周以来，他们一直在冈山镇四处搜寻，尽可能多地为船只装载必需品。这艘船足够大，能装下不少东西。它有多个睡眠舱，他们便将未使用的舱室中的床铺和家具移除，改作储物之用。摩托车（当然是被仔细包装好的）、干粮、书籍、衣物、工具、户外装备、个人物品等等。

The motorcycles had been packed very well. Shinji have visited a parcel packing company and looked around in there. It turned out they could pack them in foam in a crate relatively easily. The day before they had set off they took the motorcycles in, drained their fluids, cleaned them, then put them each into a very large and thick plastic bag. This was then slid into the crate. Shinji had taken the top of the crate off too so that they could squirt the foam in from the top and they would not have to worry about damaging the cycles by laying them over. The foam set pretty fast, and they finished it off by topping off the last few inches of airspace and nailing the crate shut again. The motorcycles had served them well, and they were very good looking. There was no way they would be leaving them there.  
摩托车被包装得非常妥当。真嗣曾造访过一家包裹打包公司，并在那里四处查看。结果发现，他们可以相对容易地将摩托车用泡沫固定在板条箱中。出发前一天，他们将摩托车送入，排空了液体，清洁干净，然后将每辆摩托车放入一个非常大且厚实的塑料袋中。接着，塑料袋被滑入板条箱内。真嗣还拆下了板条箱的顶盖，以便从顶部喷入泡沫，这样就不必担心翻转时会损坏摩托车。泡沫凝固得相当快，他们最后填补了剩余的几英寸空气空间，并再次钉紧了板条箱。这些摩托车一直表现出色，外观也非常吸引人。他们绝不会将它们遗弃在那里。

Later that night had been a bit of a special moment. They had both had a lot of time to think about their leaving, and Shinji had almost gotten cold feet. He was leaving behind everything and what he considered the resting place of everyone he knew. He wept openly at the still fresh memories of his loss, and Asuka had tried to console him as best she could. It would take some getting used to, being away that is. Despite the strangeness of another culture, Japan had grown on her too. They had gone to bed early that night, with Asuka whispering to Shinji in the no longer lonely night. They had each other, and that would suffice.  
那晚是个特别的时刻。他们都有很多时间思考即将离开的事，而真嗣几乎临阵退缩。他正要离开所有的一切，以及他所认为的所有人安息之地。他对着那些仍新鲜的失去记忆痛哭流涕，明日香尽力安慰他。适应离开需要时间。尽管异国文化的陌生感，日本也让她产生了依恋。那晚他们早早入睡，明日香在不再孤单的夜晚轻声对真嗣耳语。他们有彼此，这就足够了。

According to the map they would be passing through the Sri Lanka Straights tomorrow. They could either go to the capital of Sri Lanka, Colombo, or they could go to the coastal Indian town of Nagercoil. "Hey Shinji? You have a preference on which city we land in?" Asuka pointed to the map.  
根据地图，他们明天将穿过斯里兰卡海峡。他们可以选择去斯里兰卡的首都科伦坡，或者去印度沿海城镇纳格科伊尔。“嘿，真嗣？你想在哪个城市降落？”明日香指着地图问道。

"Well, I think we might be best off going to the larger ones. They will likely have better facilities, and larger quantities of whatever we will want." Shinji studied the map for a moment.  
“嗯，我觉得我们最好去大城市。那里可能有更好的设施，以及更多我们想要的东西。”真嗣仔细研究了一会儿地图。

Asuka nodded in agreement. "What all do we need, anyhow?" They had only been out for about 2 weeks, so they had not really run out of anything.  
明日香点头表示同意。“我们到底需要些什么呢？”他们才出海大约两周，所以并没有真正用完什么东西。

"Well I would like to get more rope just in case something breaks while we are out here. I would hate to be caught without any. Also, I took a look at the motor, and I found out why it was missing a stroke. One of the spark plugs has a crack in it so it was grounded. No spark, so we need a new one. And we can get more gas. Plus there should be some places around where we can get some local spices and stuff. It would help liven up the meals some I think." Shinji ticked off his fingers while he said this.  
“嗯，我想多买些绳子，以防我们在外面时有什么东西坏了。我不想毫无准备。另外，我检查了发动机，发现了它缺火的原因。其中一个火花塞有裂纹，所以接地了。没有火花，所以我们需要一个新的。还有，我们可以多买点汽油。而且附近应该有些地方能买到当地的香料之类的东西。我觉得这会让饭菜更美味一些。”真嗣一边说一边用手指点着。

"OK. Sounds good to me. It'll be good to get my feet on solid ground again. It is weird to be moving all the time." Asuka jotted down their geo-coordinate position in the journal. "Looks like we are at about 11 degrees 35 minutes 49 seconds by 81 degrees 30 minutes and 05 seconds."  
“好的。听起来不错。再次踏上坚实的地面感觉会很好。一直移动有点奇怪。”明日香在日记本上记下了他们的地理坐标。“看起来我们在北纬 11 度 35 分 49 秒，西经 81 度 30 分 05 秒。”

"I still can't work those out in my head. I try to visualize it and I can't." For the last week they had been playing a sort of game. Visualize their position according to their previous position. If you can work out the geo coordinate in your head you can figure out almost exactly what direction you are traveling.  
"我还是没法在脑子里解开这些。我试着去想象，但做不到。" 过去一周，他们一直在玩一种游戏。根据之前的位置想象自己的位置。如果你能在脑海中计算出地理坐标，你几乎可以准确地判断出你正在朝哪个方向前进。

"Don't worry, it is not of much practical use anyhow." Asuka smiled at Shinji. "You going fishing again today?"  
"别担心，反正这也没什么实际用处。" 明日香对真嗣笑了笑。"你今天又要去钓鱼吗？"

"Yup. Wanna come? I am not much good at it. In fact I think you are better than I am. You have certainly caught more fish." He grabbed the poles out of the stand up closet on the way to the steps that went on deck.  
"是啊。想一起来吗？我不太擅长这个。事实上，我觉得你比我强。你确实钓到过更多的鱼。" 他在走向通往甲板的台阶时，从立式橱柜里拿出了钓竿。

Asuka jumped up and followed him out of the room, picking up her sunglasses on the way out. Outside the sun shone brightly on the water. They had been fortunate that whoever had owned the sailboat had left their sunglasses there. Shinji and Asuka both had soon discovered that they would have to let their eyes adjust to the glare of the sun reflecting off of the water.  
明日香跳起来，跟着他走出房间，顺手拿起她的太阳镜。外面阳光灿烂，照耀在水面上。他们很幸运，帆船的前主人留下了太阳镜。很快，真嗣和明日香都发现，他们必须让眼睛适应阳光在水面上的反光。

Sitting on the side of the boat with feet dangling off almost touching the water, they baited their hooks and cast their lines, and waited, talking idly back and forth. Recently much of their talk had turned to possibilities. You might even call it theorizing. Assuming that there were some higher power at work, there would have to be provisions made for perpetuating the human species right? Otherwise it would die out with this current generation, or subsequent generations would devolve through inbreeding. Looking at the situation pragmatically had allowed them to talk about the subject more freely that they otherwise would have.  
他们坐在船边，双脚几乎触碰到水面，装上鱼饵，抛出钓线，然后等待着，有一搭没一搭地聊着。最近，他们的谈话转向了各种可能性，甚至可以说是理论探讨。假设有一个更高力量在起作用，那么必然会有延续人类物种的安排，对吧？否则，这一代人之后，或者通过近亲繁殖退化的后代，人类将会灭绝。从实际角度看待这个问题，使他们能够更自由地讨论这个话题，否则他们可能不会这么坦率。

Anyhow, also assuming that those provisions had been made, what, then, where they? A get out of inbreeding free card so to speak? And even so, it would take many hundreds of years just to have a community of people again.  
无论如何，假设这些预防措施已经到位，那么，他们又在哪里呢？可以说是一张避免近亲繁殖的自由卡？即便如此，也需要数百年的时间才能再次形成一个人群。

As part of their reading material, Shinji had brought along a Holy Bible, and had consulted it thoroughly on the matter. According to the opening books, Adam and Eve (he still had trouble thinking about those two names without associating them with the First angel and Eva) must have had genetically perfect DNA. In theory then their offspring would have either no DNA degradation or so little of it that inbreeding would not matter. Only after so many successive generations would they have to worry about complications arising from matching pairs of hazardous DNA sequences. Of course they would not know any of this, but it would become apparent soon that intra family couplings would not work.  
作为阅读材料的一部分，真嗣带了一本圣经，并就此事仔细查阅了它。根据开篇书籍所述，亚当和夏娃（他仍然难以不将这两个名字与第一使徒和 Eva 联系起来）必定拥有基因上完美的 DNA。理论上，他们的后代要么没有 DNA 退化，要么退化极少，以至于近亲繁殖无关紧要。只有在经历了如此多的连续代数之后，他们才需要担心由危险 DNA 序列配对引起的并发症。当然，他们不会知道这一切，但很快就会显而易见，家族内部的结合是行不通的。

Also according to the text, people of that time lived much longer than is normal for their current time. Abraham and Sarah even bore children at the age of 100, and Methuselah lived to be about 1000 years old. SO with the unnaturally long lives they stood a much better chance of bearing more children thus populating much faster. With a larger population base coming so quickly, they could stop inbreeding in fewer generations that otherwise, thus cutting down on the difficulties resulting from it.  
根据文本记载，那个时代的人们寿命远超现今常态。亚伯拉罕和撒拉甚至在百岁高龄生育子女，而玛士撒拉更是活到了约一千岁。因此，他们拥有非自然的长寿，大大增加了生育更多后代的可能性，从而加速了人口增长。随着人口基数的迅速扩大，他们能在更少的代际内停止近亲繁殖，从而减少由此带来的困难。

While they were discussing this Shinji caught a couple of medium sized fish, and Asuka caught one small one. "What is your secret, Shinji?"  
在他们讨论这些的时候，真嗣捉到了几条中等大小的鱼，而明日香只捉到一条小鱼。“真嗣，你的秘诀是什么？”

"Ancient Japanese secret." He smiled at her, and showed his results off to her. "You just have to be lucky I guess."  
“古老的日本秘密。”他笑着对她说，并向她展示了自己的成果。“大概只是运气好吧。”

"Some Ancient Secret. Who's gonna clean it?"  
"某个古老的秘密。谁来清理它？"

"I was hoping that you could. I just don't have the stomach for doing that, even if it is to an animal." Shinji's seriousness was evidence enough to Asuka exactly how he felt. Shinji had always been a bit squeamish, but ever since Third Impact he had shied away from anything to do with blood or anatomy with the exception of medical related things.  
"我希望你能帮忙。我实在受不了做这种事，即使是动物也不行。" 真嗣的严肃态度足以让明日香明白他的感受。真嗣一直有点胆小，但自从第三次冲击后，除了与医疗相关的事情外，他一直回避任何与血液或解剖有关的东西。

Of course, Asuka thought, with the things that he had seen, it was no wonder. He had tried to describe the horrible image of Unit 02 torn apart, and the agony that he had felt knowing that she had suffered through all that pain.  
当然，明日香心想，经历了那些事情，难怪他会这样。他曾试图描述零二号机被撕裂的可怕景象，以及他得知她经历了那么多痛苦时的那种痛苦。

"OK, Shinji. I can clean them. But you have to cook em!" She smiled. It was so much easier to live with the boy like this. No more expectations of him than to live his life the way he wanted to with someone who loved him, and whom he loved in return. She regarded this previous though for a moment. She should stop calling him a boy. He was a man. Anyone who was responsible for their own actions could be considered an adult.  
"好的，真嗣。我可以清理它们。但你得负责烹饪！" 她微笑着。像这样和男孩生活在一起轻松多了。不再对他有过多的期待，只要他能按照自己的意愿生活，与一个爱他、他也爱的人在一起。她对这个想法沉思了一会儿。她应该停止称呼他为男孩。他是个男人。任何对自己的行为负责的人都可以被视为成年人。

"That's fine. I like to cook. Which way would you like them tonight?"  
"那很好。我喜欢烹饪。今晚你想怎么吃？"

"How about beer-battered? I liked that the last time you did it. Where did you find that recipe?"  
"来个啤酒炸的怎么样？上次你做的时候我很喜欢。你从哪儿找到那个食谱的？"

"A book in the library. I am going to miss that library. I suppose I will have to learn German when we get there. Otherwise I'll never be able to read anything. I will have to get you to translate." Shinji absently jammed his finger in his ear and wiggled it back and forth.  
"图书馆里的一本书。我会想念那个图书馆的。我想到了那里我得学德语，否则我什么也读不了。我得让你帮我翻译。" 真嗣心不在焉地用手指戳了戳耳朵，来回晃动着。

Asuka thumbed the gold ring that he had made for her. At first she had been afraid that it might be too soft to wear on her finger on a daily basis, but time had revealed that while it was fairly pure, it was also strong.  
明日香摩挲着他为她制作的金戒指。起初她担心它可能太软，不适合日常佩戴，但时间证明，虽然它相当纯净，但也十分坚固。

"Well I can teach you German. Once you have the alphabet down it is only a matter of learning the words. Reading it is much easier than reading Japanese. The Kanji is strictly memorization, but with the grouping of letters you have a pattern to go by. Stringing together letters that nearly always have specific sounds is a lot more simple than memorizing thousands of characters that look so much alike." They took the fish below and Shinji talked while Asuka cleaned the fish. He did not watch, just talked.  
"好吧，我可以教你德语。一旦你掌握了字母表，剩下的就是学习单词了。读德语比读日语容易多了。汉字纯粹靠记忆，但字母组合有规律可循。把几乎总是发特定音的字母串联起来，比记忆成千上万个看起来很相似的汉字要简单得多。" 他们把鱼拿到下面，真嗣边说边聊，而明日香则清洗着鱼。他没有看，只是说着话。

Much later, after dinner, they sat again on the deck of their boat, watching the sun go down. The purples and blues melted into a bright orange and red sky, which ended with a slowly sinking ball of fire, that when its last shining rays dipped below the water allowed the night to sink in more quickly. They had the generator on board and it would power all of the 12 volt electronics on board, but for now they were both content to sit in the growing darkness and enjoy each others company. For a couple of months now, this time had become their "get close" time.  
很久以后，晚餐过后，他们再次坐在船的甲板上，看着夕阳西下。紫色和蓝色渐渐融入明亮的橙红色天空，最终随着缓缓下沉的火球，当它最后一缕光芒沉入水面，夜幕便更快地降临了。船上装有发电机，可以为所有 12 伏电子设备供电，但此刻他们都很满足于坐在渐浓的黑暗中，享受彼此的陪伴。这几个月来，这段时间已成为他们的“亲密时光”。

No sex. Just love. And some necking. Among other things.  
没有性爱。只有爱。还有些亲昵举动。以及其他事情。

This night the stars came out like any other. The sky was almost totally clear, and the water reflected their light well. After the night had fully come, they sat whispering about the future, and it was not long before Asuka found that Shinji had been thinking about things along the same lines as she had.  
这一晚，星星如往常一样出现。天空几乎完全晴朗，水面很好地反射了星光。夜幕完全降临后，他们低声谈论着未来，不久阿斯卡发现真嗣也在思考着与她相似的事情。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

"Yeah?" "嗯？"

A long pause followed. From the way he had said her name, she knew he was working for the right words.  
一阵漫长的沉默随之而来。从他念她名字的方式，她知道他在寻找合适的词句。

"I love you, Asuka." Well at least he had grown comfortable saying that.  
“我爱你，明日香。”好吧，至少他现在说这句话已经很自然了。

"Shinji, is there something bothering you? Spit it out."  
“真嗣，你是不是有什么心事？有话直说。”

"I was just thinking about what we were talking about earlier."  
"我刚才在想我们之前聊的事情。"

Asuka decided to be playful. "About the beer-batter?"  
明日香决定开个玩笑。"关于啤酒面糊？"

"No." So much for that. "It was about... having children. I just... want you to know that I am not afraid of any outcome."  
"不是。" 这个话题算是结束了。"是关于...生孩子的事。我只是...想让你知道，我并不害怕任何结果。"

So there it was. Even though he did not get fully to the meaning of it, she knew what he meant. He loved her very much and he wanted to have a child someday. Somewhat mature thoughts for someone his age, but then considering the circumstances they were in, it was to be expected for some one to be forcibly matured. And it was not too surprising that he had come to this either. They had essentially been avoiding direct references to sex for a long time.  
事情就是这样。尽管他并未完全理解其含义，但她明白他的心意。他深爱着她，并希望有一天能拥有一个孩子。对于他这个年纪的人来说，这些想法显得颇为成熟，但考虑到他们所处的环境，这种被迫的成熟也是可以预见的。而他能有这样的想法，也并不令人意外。他们长期以来基本上都在避免直接提及性的话题。

"I understand, Shinji. But of course, now I want to know what your gonna do about it. Hmm?" Shinji turned a very bright red, and avoided the prod. "It's OK Shinji. You don't have to say or do anything until you are ready, OK? I was just joking around. You are too serious sometimes." Asuka nuzzled her head under his arm, and sat there leaning against him. "But one of these days you better make good on all this talk. Or I will just have to take matters into my own hands."  
“我明白，真嗣。但当然，现在我想知道你打算怎么处理这件事。嗯？”真嗣的脸变得通红，避开了她的挑逗。“没关系，真嗣。你不必急着说什么或做什么，直到你准备好为止，好吗？我只是在开玩笑。你有时候太严肃了。”明日香把头靠在他的臂弯里，依偎在他身旁。“但总有一天，你得兑现这些话。否则，我就只好自己动手了。”

Shinji sighed. He was trying to be serious, but Asuka was having some fun. That was OK, though. She had a right to. Shinji sat up straighter. "Asuka? Do you think that I am much different that I used to be. You know, before..."  
真嗣叹了口气。他试图保持严肃，但明日香却在享受乐趣。不过这没关系，她有这个权利。真嗣坐得更直了些。“明日香？你觉得我和以前相比有很大不同吗？你知道，在……之前。”

It was hard for Asuka to put into words exactly how much he was different. "You are almost like... a different person who occasionally tries to be like a person you once heard about. Shinji, you are not the person that you once were. Just like I am not the person that I once was. Why do you ask?"  
对于明日香来说，要准确描述他变得多么不同，实在难以言表。“你几乎就像……一个偶尔试图变得像你曾经听说过的人的另一个人。真嗣，你不再是曾经的你了。就像我也不再是曾经的我一样。你为什么要问呢？”

"I just wondered for a moment if we would ever have fallen in love the way we were. If we had been the same people we were then, what would have happened?"  
“我只是突然想知道，如果我们还是原来的样子，我们是否会以那种方式相爱。如果我们还是那时候的我们，会发生什么？”

"Shinji I have the feeling that all kinds of things changed on that day." Asuka barely finished this before she yawned a gaping stretching yawn. "Wanna talk about it in bed? I am about ready to go."  
“真嗣，我感觉那天发生了各种变化。”明日香几乎还没说完就打了个大大的哈欠。“想在床上聊吗？我差不多准备睡了。”

Shinji smiled. "You know, if you would have said something like that back then, I would have expected some fighting not long afterwards."  
真嗣笑了。“你知道吗，如果那时候你这么说，我会以为不久后就会有场打斗。”

"Which reminds me, you owe me a rematch. I will not be defeated so easily. Maybe not tonight, but you better get to it soon. No more Ms. Nice Asuka either." Her wicked grin shone in the soft light.  
“这倒提醒我了，你还欠我一场复赛。我可不会那么轻易被打败。也许不是今晚，但你最好尽快行动。别再是那位好心的明日香了。”她的邪恶笑容在柔和的光线中闪耀。

"Yeah yeah. I heard it all before." They went below, and Shinji hit the switch for the power generator. In a few seconds the running interior lights came on. They had found early on that you had to run the generator for a couple of hours each day to recharge the batteries. Running lights, the clocks the fridge, and other electronics worked off of five wet cell batteries, that were in turn hooked to the generator. They would sustain the boat for perhaps a little more than a day, but if they were not charged you would have to worry about resetting a lot of stuff. Not to mention the GPS worked on that circuit and they would want to know their position at all times.  
“是是，这些我以前都听过。”他们下到船舱，真嗣按下了发电机的开关。几秒钟后，室内的灯光亮了起来。他们很早就发现，每天需要运行发电机几个小时来给电池充电。灯光、时钟、冰箱和其他电子设备都由五块湿电池供电，而这些电池又连接到发电机上。这些电池能让船维持一天多一点的时间，但如果它们没有充电，你就得担心重置很多东西。更不用说 GPS 也在这个电路中，他们需要随时知道自己的位置。

"Are we still on course?" Shinji called to Asuka.  
"我们还在航线上吗？" 真嗣向明日香喊道。

"Yeah. We may want to take shifts tonight. According to our speed we should come across Sri Lanka in a few hours."  
"是的。今晚我们可能需要轮班。按照我们的速度，几个小时后我们应该会经过斯里兰卡。"

"OK I will take the first shift. Say five hours?"  
"好的，我先值班。五个小时怎么样？"

"Sounds good to me. You going to want anything to eat while you are up there?"  
"听起来不错。你上去的时候想吃点什么吗？"

"Naah. I think I will be alright. You get some good rest OK?" Shinji watched Asuka as she brushed her teeth. She mumbled something back to him through the toothpaste.  
""不用了。我觉得我会没事的。你好好休息，好吗？"" 真嗣看着明日香刷牙。她嘴里含着牙膏，含糊地回应了他一句。

Up on deck he hit the switch for the high candle-power lamp on the mizzen mast. It shone out into the darkness. Next to the wheel there was a small back-lit LCD screen. The boat was outfitted with a forward looking range finder, which currently reported that they were still at a good 300 meters of water.  
他走上甲板，按下了后桅杆上高烛光强度灯的开关。灯光穿透了黑暗。舵轮旁边有一个小型背光 LCD 屏幕。船上装备了一个前向测距仪，目前显示他们仍在 300 米深的水域。

Asuka poked her head our from the below decks hatch. "Goodnight, Shinji. Don't run us aground!" She giggled a little to herself and went below-decks again.  
明日香从甲板下的舱口探出头来。“晚安，真嗣。别让我们搁浅了！”她轻声笑了笑，又回到了甲板下。

Shinji stood for a while watching water that he could not quite see slip almost noiselessly past the boat. Life was good. And it had changed so much. Gone were the days that he had been Shinji the student, living life with no purpose. Also gone was Shinji the Pilot, living only because his father told him to. Now he was Shinji the sailor! Well not really. But he was living a life greater than he had imagined that he could have. The cost was high, but he was having the time of his life, and Asuka was there to share it with him.  
真嗣站了一会儿，凝视着几乎看不见的水流几乎无声地掠过船边。生活很美好。而且变化如此之大。曾经的学生真嗣，过着没有目标的日子，已经一去不复返了。同样消失的还有作为驾驶员的真嗣，仅仅因为父亲命令而活着。现在他是水手真嗣！好吧，并不完全是。但他正过着比想象中更美好的生活。代价虽高，但他正享受着一生中最美好的时光，而且有明日香与他共享这一切。

He wondered about a lot of things when he was alone. What would they find in Germany? What was going to happen in their future? Why in the world is it called a mizzen mast? And what is that stupid ringing in his ear?  
当他独自一人时，他会思考很多事情。他们在德国会发现什么？他们的未来会发生什么？为什么那东西叫后桅？还有他耳朵里那烦人的铃声是什么？

### Chapter 13 Landfall 

A note: It was recently brought to my attention that there is a rather large discrepancy in the timeline here. When I started this series, I was under the assumption that there was not an exact date of Third Impact. I looked all over the place, but I could not find it. So I made one up. Unfortunately there is one, and I have been told that the actual Third Impact occurred on or about 01JAN2016. This presents a problem since it is approx June or something (I am too tired to bother figuring it out) when they awaken on the shore. So... let us assume for a moment that they have been in a suspended animation like state since that time. Five to six months, which could be worked, but that would then present more problems. For one, there would be no more usable perishable food in the stores then. Also, fuel separation would have started setting in so they would have to either remix it (I don't even know if you can do this) or find some other way to work with it. I have supposed that they have learned through judicious use of the library how to remix the fuel, but then if it was already separated they would have to find the library first. Anyhow, just making you aware. Since I am god over the story, lets just say that everything worked out in the end, and some day I will go through and figure something out. *S* Until then I hope that you continue enjoying my story as much (if not more!) than I have enjoyed writing it.  
注：最近有人提醒我，这里的时序存在一个相当大的出入。当初开始这个系列时，我以为第三次冲击没有确切的日期。我四处查找，却未能找到。于是我自行设定了一个。不幸的是，确实存在一个官方日期，据告知实际的第三次冲击发生在大约 2016 年 1 月 1 日。这带来了一个问题，因为当他们在岸边苏醒时，大约是六月左右（我太累了，懒得细算）。所以……我们暂且假设他们自那时起一直处于某种休眠状态。五到六个月的时间，虽可解释，但会引发更多问题。首先，那时商店里将没有可食用的易腐食品。其次，燃料分离现象可能已经开始，他们要么需要重新混合燃料（我甚至不确定这是否可行），要么寻找其他方法应对。我设想他们通过图书馆的谨慎利用学会了如何重新混合燃料，但如果燃料已经分离，他们首先得找到图书馆。总之，特此提醒。 既然我是这个故事的主宰，那就让我们假设一切最终都圆满解决，总有一天我会深入其中，想出个所以然来。*微笑* 在那之前，希望你们能继续享受我的故事，甚至比我写作时还要投入。

---
It was about 3:00 in the morning when Asuka came below deck and woke the sleeping Shinji up. They were within 3 or 4 miles of shore and she wanted to anchor so that they could sail into the docks in daylight.  
大约凌晨三点，明日香来到下层甲板，唤醒了熟睡的真嗣。他们距离海岸只有三四英里，她想抛锚，以便能在白天驶入码头。

When she shook him a little, Shinji snorted and smiled. This only prompted the girl to play with him a little to get him to wake up. She tickled his ears and nose, blew in his ear, kissed him on the cheek, and tormented his unconscious form. It was not until she thumped his nose that he came around."Huh?" He blinked his eyes. "Time to get up?"  
当她轻轻摇晃他时，真嗣哼了一声，微笑起来。这反而促使女孩逗弄他，想让他完全醒来。她挠他的耳朵和鼻子，对着他的耳朵吹气，亲吻他的脸颊，捉弄他无意识的身体。直到她轻拍他的鼻子，他才醒过来。“嗯？”他眨了眨眼。“该起床了吗？”

"No, I just needed some help. I need you to give me a hand taking the sails down. We are not far offshore and I want to wait till daylight to dock."  
"不，我只是需要帮忙。我需要你帮我一起把帆降下来。我们离岸不远，我想等到天亮再靠岸。"

"Ugh.. What time is it?" Shinji looked out the window and saw that it was indeed still dark outside.  
"呃...现在几点了？" 真嗣望向窗外，确实外面还是一片漆黑。

"About 3 AM." Asuka sounded cheery. Of course she'd had a bit of sleep.  
"大约凌晨三点。" 明日香听起来很精神。当然，她已经睡了一会儿。

"Mmm." Shinji wrinkled his brow, and thinking with all of his might, he tried to decide on his next course of action. Then he had it; get dressed. It was so hard to think when just waking up.  
“嗯。” 真嗣皱起眉头，竭尽全力思考，试图决定下一步行动。随后他灵光一现：穿衣服。刚醒来时思维总是如此困难。

After doing so, he was led by Asuka on deck and they went about lowering the sails, and packing them away. This would allow them to remain anchored in their current position, and let the sun come up so they could dock.  
穿戴完毕后，他在明日香的带领下登上甲板，开始降帆并将其收起。这样他们就能保持在当前位置抛锚，等待日出以便靠岸。

The ringing had returned in Shinji's ears at some point during the night, and he had a sense of vertigo added to it now. It felt a bit like standing on the head of a pin. Every direction was down.  
夜间某个时刻，真嗣的耳边再次响起了铃声，现在还伴随着一种眩晕感。感觉就像站在针尖上，每个方向都是下方。

As he zipped up the waterproof bag over the sails, Asuka lowered the anchor and let the line play was heading back down when he clipped his trailing foot on a stair and down he went, rolling over two more, and laying sprawled on the floor below. Hearing the noise, Asuka ran to investigate, only to see Shinji trying to push himself up off of the floor.  
当他拉上防水袋的拉链盖住帆布时，明日香放下了锚，让绳索缓缓下降，就在他转身下楼时，不小心被拖着的脚绊到了台阶，整个人滚了下去，连续翻滚了两圈，最后四仰八叉地躺在了下面的地板上。听到声响，明日香跑去查看，只见真嗣正试图从地板上爬起来。

"Shinji!" She jumped down the steps being careful not to land on him, and picked him up. "My God! Are you alright? What happened?"  
“真嗣！”她小心翼翼地跳下台阶，避免踩到他，然后扶他起来。“天哪！你还好吗？发生了什么？”

"Ugh. I don't know, I just lost my balance. I got dizzy and it felt like I was standing up straight, but I must have been leaning forward." He lifted his hand to his right ear and wiggled it back and forth, and then a searing pain, like a hot pin being stuck in his ear cut through his head. Wincing he bent over, cupping his hand over the ear and cried out.  
“呃，我不知道，我只是失去了平衡。我感觉自己站得很直，但肯定是在向前倾。”他抬起手摸了摸右耳，左右晃动，突然一阵剧痛，就像一根滚烫的针刺入耳朵，穿透了他的头。他疼得弯下腰，用手捂住耳朵，痛呼出声。

Surprised, Asuka called his name, and guided him to the seat at the table. "Is it your ear, Shinji?"  
惊讶之下，明日香呼唤他的名字，并引导他坐到桌边的椅子上。“是你的耳朵吗，真嗣？”

"Mmm. Yeah." His brows furrowed as he tried to block out the pain. "Get the medical kit! It has an ear scope in it."  
“嗯，是的。”他皱起眉头，试图屏蔽疼痛。“去拿医药箱！里面有耳镜。”

Hurriedly Asuka retrieved the medical kit, and fumbled with the scope. She put one of the specula on it, flicked on the light, and after prying Shinji's hand from his ear, she looked inside. At first all she noticed was that Shinji did not clean his ears very well. She had never looked in ears so she didn't know what she was looking at. Then she saw a very red and swollen something at the back of the ear canal. It was probably the eardrum, and it did not look good."Shinji, you have got an ear infection. I don't know how bad it is, but it looks pretty painful. We can get some medicine in Colombo. I am sure there would be some there."  
明日香急忙取来医药箱，摸索着耳镜。她装上一个窥耳器，打开灯光，在掰开真嗣捂着耳朵的手后，朝里看去。起初她只注意到真嗣的耳朵清洁得不太好。她从未看过耳朵内部，所以并不清楚自己在看什么。随后她发现耳道深处有个异常红肿的部位。那很可能是鼓膜，看起来情况不妙。“真嗣，你得了中耳炎。我不知道有多严重，但看起来很痛。我们可以在科伦坡买点药。那里肯定有的。”

"OK. Is there some painkiller in there?"  
"好的，里面有止痛药吗？"

"It's all no-name stuff. Acetylsalicylic acid?"  
"都是些不知名的药。乙酰水杨酸？"

"Aspirin. Can you give me a couple?" Asuka ripped open the single serving packet and gave the contents to him, then poured him a cup of water.  
"阿司匹林。能给我几片吗？" 明日香撕开单次剂量包装，将药片递给他，然后为他倒了一杯水。

"Do you want to wait until sunrise to get underway again? We can go now if you want. There is still a few more miles to go."  
"你想等到日出再出发吗？如果你想的话，我们现在就可以走。还有几英里要走。"

"No, lets wait until it is light. We don't want to run aground. It'll be alright. We can go back to sleep and wait it out. Besides I am tired anyhow."  
"不，我们等到天亮吧。我们不想搁浅。没关系，我们可以回去睡觉，等着天亮。再说，我也很累了。"

"Well, I was going to have you get to bed anyhow. I can maneuver us in there just fine by myself." She smiled at her sick Shinji, and nuzzled his face. "Come on, lets get you into bed, and asleep."Asuka put the medical kit away and ushered Shinji into the sleeping compartment. It was still cool out so they had a couple of blankets on the bed. But that was fine, Asuka liked being snuggled up to Shinji. She wondered sometimes how she ever lived without him. Just before she slipped off to sleep, she though that it was a damned good thing that Shinji insisted that they bring that medical kit, because the otoscope had come in very handy.  
"嗯，我本来就打算让你去睡觉的。我自己一个人就能把我们弄进去。"" 她对着生病的真嗣微笑，并轻轻蹭了蹭他的脸。""来吧，我们让你上床睡觉。"" 明日香把医药箱收好，领着真嗣进了休息舱。外面依然凉爽，所以床上铺了几条毯子。但这没关系，明日香喜欢依偎在真嗣身边。她有时会想，没有他她是怎么活下来的。就在她快要睡着的时候，她想，真嗣坚持要带上那个医药箱真是太好了，因为耳镜确实派上了大用场。"

Asuka and Shinji drove the pickup truck through the slush on their way in to town. With only another day to spare before their departure from Japan they were going back for anything else they might want or need on their trip. They would stop by the little convenience store and stock up on batteries and whatnot, then head over to the library and fill up on reading material. You never know when you will be bored and in need of a good book.  
明日香和真嗣驾驶着皮卡车穿过泥泞，前往镇上。距离他们离开日本只剩一天时间，他们打算回去取一些旅行中可能需要的东西。他们会先去那家小便利店，囤些电池之类的物品，然后去图书馆，装满阅读材料。你永远不知道什么时候会感到无聊，需要一本好书。

Then they would head to the hospital on the north side of town for some additional medical kit that they had at the house was good, but it did not have surgical equipment in it. Metzenbaum scissors and clamps and scalpels were not the kind of things that were generally included in first aid kits, but then, first aid kits assumed that you would have the ability to get good medical assistance within a certain timeframe.  
接着，他们会前往镇北的医院，补充一些医疗用品。虽然家里的急救箱不错，但没有手术器械。梅岑鲍姆剪刀、夹子和手术刀这类东西通常不会包含在急救包里，但话说回来，急救包默认你在一定时间内能获得良好的医疗援助。

As he drove, Shinji added another destination to his list. The SDF compound or some other place that would have more ammunition. They had almost totally depleted both the 9mm rounds and the 5.56mm M4 rounds doing target practice. Shinji was a good shot but he found very fast that Asuka was a superb marksman. She hit the 25 meter target at 50 meters 48 out of 50 times with the M4, and the 25 meter target simulated a 300 meter silhouette. If she could kill with such accuracy at 600 meters, she was truly a force to be reckoned with.  
在驾车途中，真嗣在他的清单上又添加了一个目的地。SDF 基地或其他能提供更多弹药的地方。他们在射击训练中几乎耗尽了所有 9 毫米子弹和 5.56 毫米 M4 子弹。真嗣枪法不错，但他很快发现明日香是个出色的神枪手。她用 M4 在 50 米外击中 25 米靶 48 次，而那个 25 米靶模拟的是 300 米的人形轮廓。如果她能在 600 米外如此精准地击杀目标，那她绝对是一股不容小觑的力量。

It took something like two hours to shop around the first three locations on the list, but finding ammunition was a little difficult. The SDF compound didn't have any more that he could find, so he'd have to find a gun store. Guns were just not that easy to come by here. But there are always people who live, not necessarily outside the law, but they do skirt it a bit. Once they exhausted all of the Army surplus stores, they took to the pawn shops. It was with the in the third that they hit pay dirt. Bigtime.  
在前三个地点逛了大约两个小时，但找到弹药有点困难。SDF 基地里他找不到更多了，所以得找一家枪店。这里的枪支并不那么容易买到。但总有一些人，不一定完全违法，但他们确实有点游走在法律边缘。在所有军用物资店都一无所获后，他们转向了当铺。正是在第三家当铺，他们找到了宝藏，大丰收。

All of the stuff up front was pretty standard. Old video games, wedding rings, clothes, some small handguns, and other bric-a-brac. In the back however they found a veritable arsenal. The guy must have been either a fanatic or some kind of militia type or something like that. He had left behind loads of ammunition of all sorts. Most of which they did not have weapons for, and some of which they could not even think of a use for in their current situation. There were grenades, grenade launcher rounds, .50 caliber rounds, several bricks of Semtex, and other extraneous stuff that looked equally dangerous. But there was also several ammo cans of more conventional ammunition. 5.56 mm, 7.62 mm (which they did not need), and 9mm.  
前面陈列的物品都相当普通。老式电子游戏、结婚戒指、衣物、几把手枪，还有其他零碎杂物。然而在后面，他们发现了一个真正的军火库。这家伙要么是个狂热分子，要么是某种民兵类型的人物。他留下了大量各式各样的弹药，其中大部分他们没有相应的武器，有些甚至在当前情况下想不出用途。有手榴弹、榴弹发射器弹药、.50 口径子弹、几大块塞姆汀炸药，以及其他看似同样危险的东西。但也有几个弹药箱装着更常规的弹药：5.56 毫米、7.62 毫米（他们不需要）和 9 毫米子弹。

They decided to take several magazines as well since they only had two apiece for each gun. When they opened up the cans of ammo, they found that the rounds had been taken out of its packaging. The 5.56mm rounds where on stripper clips that could be used for speed loading the magazines, but the 9mm rounds where loose. Fortunately there was a speed loader for those as the heavy cans back out to the truck took only a minute or two, and after picking through the other stuff in the back of the store they were on their way.  
他们决定多拿几本杂志，因为每支枪只有两本。当他们打开弹药罐时，发现子弹已经从包装中取出。5.56 毫米子弹装在剥壳夹上，可用于快速装填弹匣，但 9 毫米子弹是散装的。幸运的是，有快速装弹器可以用于这些，将沉重的罐子搬回卡车上只花了一两分钟，之后他们在商店后部翻找其他物品，便继续前行。

It was kind of scary to think that there were people who collected things like that for who knows what purpose amongst a center of population such as Okayama."You want to expend some of this tonight?" Shinji broke the silence with the question.  
想到在像冈山这样的城市中心，有人收集这些东西，不知出于何种目的，真是有点吓人。“今晚你想用掉一些吗？”真嗣打破沉默问道。

"I guess so. I think I like shooting guns more myself that using my EVA to do it."  
“我想是的。我自己更喜欢用枪射击，而不是用 EVA 来完成。”

"Me too, but I think I just never liked doing anything in my EVA. It was comfortable in a way, but killing was not something that I wanted to do." Shinji heaved a sigh, and wound the truck through the twists and turns that lead to the house.  
"我也是，但我觉得我从来就不喜欢在 EVA 里做任何事。那种舒适感是有的，但杀人不是我想做的事。" 真嗣叹了口气，驾驶着卡车穿梭在通往房子的曲折道路上。

"I know, Shinji. But don't feel bad about it OK? It was something that had to be done." Asuka laid her hand on his shoulder, trying to comfort him.  
"我知道，真嗣。但别为此感到难过，好吗？那是必须做的事。" 明日香把手放在他的肩膀上，试图安慰他。

"Why? Why did it have to be done? It did not really accomplish much. It only prolonged the inevitable." He sighed again and shook his head.  
"为什么？为什么必须这样做？它并没有真正达成什么。只是拖延了不可避免的事。" 他再次叹息，摇了摇头。

"No, Shinji. I think that it would have been much different if we would have failed to kill any of the angels. Much different. I don't think that anything would have survived. Not even the fabled cockroaches that would survive nuclear holocaust."  
"不，真嗣。我想如果我们未能消灭任何一个使徒，情况会大不相同。非常不同。我认为没有任何东西能幸存下来，甚至连传说中能在核灾难中存活的蟑螂也不例外。"

"Well, while I don't like the means to this end, and I certainly don't like the entire situation, I do like one thing about it. I met someone I thought I knew, and I found out she was a lot different that I thought." He smiled to himself.  
"好吧，虽然我不喜欢达到这个结果的手段，也绝对不喜欢整个局面，但我确实喜欢其中一件事。我遇到了一个我以为我认识的人，结果发现她和我所想的截然不同。" 他自顾自地笑了。

She planted a kiss on his cheek which distracted him enough so that he nearly hit a tree."Hey! Don't distract the driver!" Smiling, he slowed and made the last turn on the driveway at their house.  
她在他的脸颊上亲了一下，这让他分心到差点撞上一棵树。"嘿！别分散司机的注意力！" 他笑着减速，在通往他们家的车道上做了最后一个转弯。

Later in the day, having packed the newest additions in the boat they set up one of their last targets on a line suspended between two trees. With three 30 round magazines apiece for the M4s they fired at the target, taking turns. Asuka hitting more often that she missed, and Shinji doing slightly better than half and half. Firing from the standing position was much harder than they made it seem in the movies. The muscles tire quickly enough that they start moving involuntarily and throwing your aim off. They don't feel tired, but they are tired enough to tremble a little.  
当天稍晚时分，他们将新添置的装备装上船，然后在两棵树之间拉起一根绳子，挂上最后一个靶子。两人各自携带三份 30 发的 M4 弹匣，轮流射击。明日香几乎弹无虚发，而真嗣则略胜于半数命中。站立射击远比电影中展现的要困难得多。肌肉很快就会疲劳，以至于不由自主地移动，导致瞄准偏差。他们并不觉得疲惫，但身体已足够疲倦，微微颤抖。

It only took a little while to finish out their ammunition, and Asuka was getting ready to go back inside when Shinji stopped her.  
没过多久，他们就打完了所有弹药，正当明日香准备回屋时，真嗣叫住了她。

"I thought we might clean them outside tonight. Maybe a campfire?" He let the suggestion hang in the air for a moment. Asuka smiled a little and nodded.  
“我想我们今晚可以在外面清理枪械，或许还可以生个篝火？”他让这个提议在空气中停留了一会儿。明日香微微一笑，点了点头。

"You want something to eat? I think we have some meat left in the freezer."  
"你想吃点什么吗？我觉得冰箱里还剩些肉。"

"Yeah, but we can get it in a while. I'm not too hungry right now. I am going to get some wood." Asuka followed Shinji back up to the house and together they loaded some of the split wood into the wheelbarrow that they took down close to the edge of the water.  
"嗯，不过我们可以待会儿再拿。我现在不太饿。我要去弄些木头。" 明日香跟着真嗣回到房子里，他们一起把一些劈好的木头装进手推车，推到水边附近。

They stacked the wood in a semi-pyramidal mound by putting sets of two logs 90 degrees to the previous set, one on top of the other. It was wide at the base and narrow at the top.  
他们将木头堆成一个半金字塔形，每一层的两根木头与上一层呈 90 度角交错叠放。底部宽阔，顶部则较窄。

"There we go. That will let it burn a long time and make a good bed of coals to keep building on if we want. Can you go get me the lighter fluid and a lighter from the shed? I am going to get some small stuff to help it catch fire."  
好了，这样可以让它燃烧很长时间，并且形成一个良好的炭床，如果我们需要的话可以继续添加燃料。你能去棚子里帮我拿点打火机油和打火机吗？我要找些小东西来帮助它点燃。

Once Asuka returned, Shinji stuffed a loose wad of leaves and grass into the middle of the pile, then squirted the lighter fluid on the outside and let it soak in for a minute or so. When he lit the leaves and grass it took a moment to catch well, but soon it flamed up and began to draw air in from the bottom of the pile. Once the flames licked over the sides of the logs the lighter fluid took over, and the fire began to really start roaring, pulling air in and fueling itself. The sun was starting to dip into the lake and soon it was gone leaving behind only the vestiges of daylight.  
当明日香回来后，真嗣将一团松散的树叶和草塞进柴堆中央，然后在外层喷上打火机油，让它渗透一会儿。当他点燃树叶和草时，起初需要一点时间才能充分燃烧，但很快火焰就升腾起来，开始从柴堆底部吸入空气。一旦火焰舔舐到木柴的边缘，打火机油便发挥了作用，火势开始真正地咆哮起来，吸入空气并自我助燃。太阳开始沉入湖中，不久便消失了，只留下残余的日光。

Asuka brought some small chairs from the house and they sat down and enjoyed the evening.  
明日香从屋里搬来几把小椅子，他们坐下来享受这个夜晚。

Shinji broke down his M4 and began cleaning the chamber first. Wiping away brass flakes and heavy carbon, he carefully moved the rag into each creavice. Asuka disassembled hers as well, and began working on the lower receiver and trigger assembly.  
真嗣拆开了他的 M4，首先开始清理枪膛。他擦去黄铜碎片和厚重的碳垢，小心翼翼地将抹布伸入每一个缝隙。明日香也拆解了她的枪，开始处理下机匣和扳机组。

"Hey, Asuka?" "嘿，明日香？"

"Yeah?" “嗯？”

"You ever wondered exactly what happened to everyone?"  
“你有没有想过，大家到底发生了什么？”

"What do you mean?" "你这是什么意思？"

"Well I mean, it is pretty evident that they turned into LCL. But why? When you die you don't turn into LCL."  
“嗯，我的意思是，很明显他们都变成了 LCL。但为什么呢？人死后并不会变成 LCL。”

"I've thought about it a bit. One of the last things I heard before I passed out was one of those guys in the command center talking about AT field. Maybe there was like an anti-AT field or whatever that negated a humans weak AT field. Without the AT field keeping their body together they turned into their component parts. I mean that is what LCL is right?"  
"我稍微想了想。在我昏过去之前，最后听到的是指挥中心里一个人提到 AT 力场。也许有什么反 AT 力场之类的东西，抵消了人类微弱的 AT 力场。没有了 AT 力场维持身体结构，他们就分解成了基本组成部分。我是说，这就是 LCL 的本质，对吧？"

"Yeah I guess. Although I'm not sure. I saw Adam, err Lillith or whatever it was under Central Dogma when I was fighting with... with Kaoru. There was a huge lake of what looked like LCL down there, and it was leaking from Lillith too." They sat silently for a few minutes.  
""嗯，我想也是。不过我不太确定。我在和……和薰战斗的时候，看到了亚当，呃，莉莉丝还是什么来着，在中央教条区下面。那里有一个巨大的 LCL 湖，而且莉莉丝也在渗出 LCL。"" 他们沉默地坐了几分钟。

"What makes you ask, Shinji?"  
"你为什么这么问，真嗣？"

"I don't know. I guess I just wonder what happened to the minds or the conciousness of the people. I felt them, I think. At some point I felt them all. It was uncomfortable."  
"我不知道。我想我只是想知道人们的思想或意识发生了什么。我感觉到了他们，我想。在某个时刻，我感受到了他们所有人。这让人很不舒服。"

"Where did they go? Or is where not really a concept when you are... incorporeal?" he asked at length. The questions would likely never be answered, and that was just as well. Maybe delving too far into a hole like that was what started the Eva project and Seele in the first place.  
"他们去了哪里？或者当你...无形的时候，'哪里'这个概念是否还存在？" 他终于问道。这些问题可能永远得不到答案，这样也好。也许正是对这样一个深渊的过度探究，才启动了 EVA 计划和 Seele 的初衷。"

After brushing, and wiping the interiors of the weapons well, they reassembled them, and watched the fire. They spoke a little, mostly about love and a little about the trip they would soon be taking. It frightened Shinji a little. There was a lot of unknown out there. At the same time, though, it was an exhilarating thought, to be setting off on an epic journey like this.  
在刷洗并仔细擦拭了武器内部后，他们重新组装起来，并注视着火焰。他们聊了一会儿，主要谈及爱情，也稍微提到了即将开始的旅行。这让真嗣有些害怕。外面有太多的未知。然而，与此同时，踏上这样一场史诗般的旅程，又是一个令人兴奋的想法。

A couple of hours later, the fire burned low, and they put it out, and went back inside. The house would sit dormant for months, maybe forever, after they had gone. It had been a good place to live, and they had wondered a few times, before starting to make plans for Germany, if they would live here for the rest of their lives.  
几个小时后，火势渐弱，他们将其扑灭，返回屋内。在他们离开后，这栋房子可能会沉寂数月，甚至永远。这里曾是宜居的好地方，他们在计划前往德国之前，也曾几度思索是否会在此度过余生。

It was very quiet and still. They lay together that night holding each other and exploring their bodies as they had a number of times before. A few words, a few other noises, and then silence once again as they fell to sleep next to one another.  
四周异常宁静。那一夜，他们相拥而卧，像以往多次那样探索彼此的身体。几句低语，几声呢喃，随后又归于沉寂，两人相依入眠。

Shinji awoke an hour after dawn. Asuka had gotten up earlier and fired up the quiet motor that propelled the ship into the harbor. She was slowing it down in preparation for mooring in a marina when he climbed the steps and came out on deck.  
清晨一小时后，真嗣醒来。早些时候，明日香已经起身启动了驱动船只进入港口的静音马达。当他登上阶梯来到甲板时，她正减速准备停靠在码头。

They day was starting overcast, and it looked like it might rain. There wasn't any fog, thankfully, and their progress coming ashore was not hampered.  
那天早晨天色阴沉，似乎要下雨。幸运的是，没有雾气，他们登陆的进程并未受阻。

They brought the ship alongside a dock, and Asuka secured it to mooring cleats. From here the city looked peaceful. They would spend the next few hours getting what they needed and get back to the boat. It would not do to dawdle for too long, here.  
他们将船靠在码头边，明日香将其系在系船柱上。从这里望去，城市显得宁静祥和。他们将在接下来的几个小时内采购所需物品，然后返回船上。在这里逗留太久可不妥。

### Chapter 14 Storms

Roads ran in every direction. From the intersection in which he now sat, cityscape extended as far as he could see. This city did not go as quietly as the ones they drove through in Japan. Probably what happened was when someone was released their car crashed and exploded or they dropped something that caught fire. Unchecked, the fire spread throughout the city, burning everything as it went. Buildings that were gutted of their floors collapsed now that there was not support between walls. It almost looked like some of the pictures that Asuka had seen of London in World War II. Rubble lay in the streets, and broken down buildings were now large piles of conglomerate concrete and steel.  
道路四通八达。从他此刻所坐的十字路口望去，城市景观绵延至视线尽头。这座城市并未如他们在日本穿行的那些般悄然沉寂。或许情况是，当有人被释放时，他们的车辆撞毁并爆炸，或是他们遗落了什么引发火灾的物品。火势未受遏制，蔓延全城，所到之处尽成灰烬。楼宇因楼层被掏空而失去支撑，纷纷坍塌。这景象几乎像明日香曾在二战伦敦照片中见过的废墟。街道上堆满瓦砾，破败的建筑化作巨型混凝土与钢筋的混合堆。

Shinji rested on a large piece of what was at one time decorative molding of a building that had fallen into the street. He clutched a 9mm pistol close. Asuka had left him here for the time being to scout for a hospital that had survived the blaze. On the next block over were buildings that had not been even marked by the flames of the fire that had consumed the city. It was reasonably likely that there might be a hospital of clinic in the area and that it still had medical supplies that they could use.  
碇真嗣靠在一截曾经是建筑物装饰线条的大块残骸上，这残骸如今已坍塌至街道。他紧握着一把 9 毫米手枪。明日香暂时留下他在这里，自己去探查一座在火灾中幸存的医院。隔着一条街的那些建筑，甚至连火舌都未曾触及。这里很可能还存有一家医院或诊所，并且仍有他们能利用的医疗物资。

Shinji returned to the thoughts he had been sharing with Asuka earlier on. They were very lucky that the human civilizations technology had survived. If you followed the thinking as though they could repopulate the human species, it would take many generations to gain any kind of headway towards being something like what they had been. Of course if Shinji had his way they would not return being the self-righteous greedy and ultimately suicidal species that they had become. This whole scenario had been thrust upon the two of them not through Shinji's choice alone. That was a combination of self preservation and love, and a final decision not to run away. But, had it not been for the meddling of men, that decision would never had to have been made.  
真嗣回到了之前与明日香分享的思绪中。人类文明的科技得以幸存，他们真是幸运至极。若按照他们能重新繁衍人类种族的设想，要取得任何进展都需要经过许多代人的努力。当然，如果真嗣能做主，他们不会回归成那个自以为是、贪婪且最终自我毁灭的物种。这一切突如其来地压在了他们两人身上，并非仅是真嗣一人的选择。这是出于自我保护与爱，以及最终决定不再逃避的结合。然而，若非人类的干预，这个决定本不必做出。

He realized that he was following another tangent again. They were lucky that technology had survived because the technology could sustain them for a long time provided they thought ahead and made the most use of everything they could find. It would do neither them nor any successive generations any good if they toiled their entire lives only trying grow food and provide shelter. There was more to life than that. Right? Shinji sometimes wondered. Sometimes he had it all figured out. Sometimes he was totally lost and he was just following the flow and dealing with the adversities that life dealt him one at a...  
他意识到自己又在追逐另一个分支了。他们很幸运，科技得以幸存，只要他们未雨绸缪，充分利用所能找到的一切，这项技术就能支撑他们很长时间。如果他们一生都在辛勤劳作，只为种植食物和提供庇护，这对他们或任何后代都没有好处。生活不仅仅是这些，对吧？真嗣有时会这样想。有时他觉得一切都已明了，有时他又完全迷失，只是随波逐流，应对生活抛给他的种种困境……

Movement out of the corner of his eye brought him from his thoughts and instantly put him on edge. He had only glimpsed it for a second but he was sure something had moved off to his left. He rolled off of the slab of concrete to the ground wincing at the spike of pain in his ear from the changing of balance. He could feel the blood pumping in his face. As silently as he could, but not as silently as he would have liked he peered over the concrete and watched as a male lion plodded its way out from behind a building catty-cornered across the intersection. It stopped in front of a department store and stood looking into the display window at the human like mannequin. It sniffed at the wall closest to it and then turned around and sprayed it.  
眼角余光中的动静将他从沉思中拉回，瞬间让他紧张起来。虽然只是匆匆一瞥，但他确信有什么东西在他左侧移动。他从混凝土板上滚落到地面，因平衡改变而引起的耳部剧痛让他皱眉。他能感觉到血液在脸上涌动。他尽可能悄无声息地，尽管不如自己期望的那样安静，探头越过混凝土块，观察到一只雄狮从交叉口对角的一栋建筑后缓缓走出。它停在一间百货商店前，站在橱窗前凝视着人形模特。它对着最近的墙壁嗅了嗅，然后转身喷了上去。

Shinji studied the animal raptly. It was well fed. He had expected any animals that they might find in the cities to be skinny and haggard but the lion had undoubtedly done well for itself. It might even have a pride living in the city. Although what they would catch was beyond him. Regardless, his heart stopped when the lion looked directly at him. It must have seen him. It had to have. It's large nostrils flared several times as it tasted the air wondering about the peculiar odor that it had not sensed in so long a time.  
真嗣专注地观察着这只动物。它被喂养得很好。他本以为在城市里能找到的动物都会瘦弱憔悴，但这头狮子显然过得不错。它甚至可能在城市里拥有一个狮群。尽管它们会捕猎什么他无从得知。无论如何，当狮子直视他时，他的心跳几乎停止了。它肯定看到了他。一定是这样。它那宽大的鼻孔张开了几次，似乎在品味空气中那股久违的奇特气味。

Then it looked away and down the street it had come from. Opening its great mouth, it roared with a deafening intensity that echoed off of the buildings and rubble canyons nearby amplifying it and distorting it into an alien sound. The roar lasted what seemed like minutes but was actually only a few seconds. Then when it was done claiming its territory, it stretched each hind leg and yawned a short yawn, then loped on it's way. After it had passed from his sight, Shinji felt tired and a little dizzy. If it had seen or noticed him in any way it could have gotten a lioness or two to hunt and kill him, or even taken care of it himself. They would have to be extra careful while they were here and get out quickly or become lion food.  
随后，它转过头，望向自己来时的街道。它张开巨口，发出震耳欲聋的咆哮，声音在四周的建筑与废墟峡谷间回荡，被放大并扭曲成一种异样的声响。这咆哮持续了仿佛数分钟之久，实则不过几秒。当它宣告完领地后，便伸展后腿，打了个短暂的哈欠，随即继续前行。待其身影消失在视线之外，真嗣感到一阵疲惫与轻微的晕眩。若它曾注意到他，或许会唤来一两头母狮猎杀他，甚至亲自出手。他们在此必须格外小心，迅速离开，否则便会沦为狮子的猎物。

A few minutes late after the dizzy spell had subsided, he crept back up to sit on the slab again, watching and hoping for Asuka to return soon. He did not like the idea of having to defend himself from things. She could do it easily, but he had always had a hard time killing anything even if it was trying to kill him. If he was attacked he would likely be forced to kill, and it did not sit well with him that he would be ending the life of another creature that was just doing what it was designed to do.  
晕眩感消退后，他迟了几分钟才悄悄爬回石板上坐下，一边观察一边期盼着明日香能尽快回来。他不喜欢不得不自卫的想法。她可以轻松应对，但他一直很难下手杀死任何东西，即便对方正试图杀他。如果受到攻击，他可能会被迫反击，但想到要结束另一个只是在做它天生该做的事的生物的生命，这让他心里很不舒服。

He sat in silence for another ten minutes when suddenly a spot of red bounced from behind a building three blocks down the road to his front. Several times Asuka stopped and sat still on her approach, but in a few minutes, she was hurrying across the intersection to him.  
他又静静坐了十分钟，突然间，一抹红色从前方三街区外的建筑物后跳了出来。明日香几次停下，静静地坐着接近，但几分钟后，她便急匆匆地穿过十字路口向他跑来。

"I found some Erythromycin and some Tetracycline. I don't know if either of them will work on that infection, but I think it is worth a shot." Asuka shook a couple of bottles. "By the way, did you see a bear?"  
“我找到了一些红霉素和四环素。我不知道它们对那种感染有没有效，但我觉得值得一试。”明日香摇了摇几个药瓶。“对了，你看到熊了吗？”

Shinji shook his head wonderingly. "No, but there was a lion that wandered through here and marked that building over there..."  
真嗣难以置信地摇了摇头。“不，但有一头狮子曾在这里游荡，还在那边的建筑上做了标记……”

"There must have been a zoo around here before Third Impact. It is a wonder that the animals got out before starving to death. Anyhow, there was a bear nosing around the hospital. It got pretty close without seeing me. I was glad that I did not have to shoot it." She patted the M4 carbine. "We ought to get back to the boat. I don't really feel like staying here much longer."  
“第三次冲击前这里一定有个动物园。真奇怪动物们是怎么在饿死前逃出来的。话说回来，有只熊在医院附近徘徊。它离我很近都没发现我。幸好我没必要开枪。”她拍了拍 M4 卡宾枪。“我们该回船上了。我实在不想在这里多待。”

Just then, the wind shifted so that it was coming down a different street, and a revolting smell hit them almost like being punched. It was beyond either of them to describe, and even though neither had had anything to eat all day, they both felt like throwing up.  
就在这时，风向变了，从另一条街吹来，一股令人作呕的气味扑面而来，几乎像被重击一般。这气味超出了他们的描述能力，尽管两人一整天都没吃东西，但他们都感到恶心想吐。

"What is that? Ughhh." Shinji looked in the direction the smell and wind was coming from and saw only burned buildings. Turning a little further he saw that he was next to a rather tall building that could look over many of the shorter buildings around it. "Lets go up a few floors and see."  
"那是什么？呃……" 真嗣顺着气味和风向望去，只见到烧毁的建筑物。他稍微转了个方向，发现自己旁边有一栋相当高的建筑，可以俯瞰周围许多较矮的楼房。"我们上几层楼看看吧。"

"I don't think I want to, Shinji. Lets go on back to the boat." Asuka looked plaintively at him.  
"我不想去，真嗣。我们还是回船上吧。" 明日香恳切地看着他。

"It will only take a couple of minutes... I just want to know what it is. And I don't want to go down there to find out." He gestured in the direction of the stench.  
"只需要几分钟……我只是想知道那是什么。而且我也不想下到那里去查明。" 他指向那股恶臭的方向。

"Well..." Asuka turned to follow him into the building. It was a good thing she came along too. Shinji was only on the 5th stair before he fell forward and would have fallen on his face if she had not caught him.  
“嗯……” 明日香转身跟着他走进大楼。还好她也一起来了。真嗣才踏上第五级台阶就向前扑倒，要不是她及时扶住，他差点就摔个狗吃屎。

"Still want to go up there?" Asuka propped him up against the wall.  
“还想上去吗？”明日香把他撑在墙边。

"Yeah. Soon as we take a look-see, then we can head back."  
“想。等我们上去看看，然后就可以回去了。”

They managed to climb several stories more then ducked out of the stairwell and into a business office. It was pretty nice. Carpeting on the floors and soft clothlike covering on the walls. A labyrinth of cubicles made a mish mash of the floor, with printer stations at evenly spaced intervals. Light poured through windows down the hallway.  
他们设法又爬了几层楼，然后从楼梯间溜进了一间商务办公室。这里相当不错，地板铺着地毯，墙壁覆盖着柔软的布料。一排排的隔间错综复杂地分布在地板上，每隔一定距离就设有打印站。光线透过走廊尽头的窗户倾泻而入。

As they neared them, the two looked out over the sprawling city. In the distance was a very large red and white object. It had crushed what looked like a quarter of the city, but because of the relative size of it, it was just barely touching the city. A huge glassy looking plate covered the top of it.  
当他们走近时，两人俯瞰着这座广袤的城市。远处有一个巨大的红白相间的物体。它似乎压垮了城市的四分之一，但由于其相对庞大的体积，它只是轻轻触碰到了城市边缘。顶部覆盖着一块巨大的、看起来像玻璃的板。

"It's... It's a finger. Oh my god." Shinji turned and dry heaved, holding onto a cubicle divider for support. Asuka just stared out the window and the gargantuan finger, with its translucent fingernail glinting in the sunlight. Shinji had described to her the sight of Rei/Lillith and her fall. Her finger was rotting even now, nearly a year later, and it still had far to go. How long would it take for the rest of the body to decay? Was most of it underwater?  
“这是……这是手指。我的天哪。”真嗣转身干呕，抓住隔板支撑自己。明日香只是凝视着窗外那根巨指，其半透明的指甲在阳光下闪闪发光。真嗣曾向她描述过丽/莉莉丝和她坠落的景象。她的手指至今仍在腐烂，将近一年过去了，腐烂的过程还远未结束。那整个身体要腐烂多久？大部分是否在水下？

"I think that I have seen enough, Shinji. Lets get out of this place. That... It gives me the creeps, and I think we need to get back underway." Shinji had finished trying to wretch and managed to nod his head. They would pick up the other items they needed.  
“我想我已经看够了，真嗣。我们离开这个地方吧。那……它让我毛骨悚然，我觉得我们需要继续前进。”真嗣终于停止了干呕，勉强点了点头。他们会捡起其他需要的物品。

They left the building the way they came in, and walked to the boat in silence. On the way they saw several other wild animals. A wolf sat sunning itself on top of a piece of corporate art; a water buffalo was pulling grass from the grounds of a park they passed.  
他们按照进来的路线离开了建筑物，沉默地走向船只。途中他们看到了几只其他野生动物。一只狼正趴在一件企业艺术品上晒太阳；一头水牛在他们经过的公园草地上拔草。

The boat was just as they had left it, and as they climbed on board Asuka spoke up. "Shinji, I want you to take one of these and get some sleep. The faster you get over that ear infection, they better off we'll be. I can pull us out of here and get back underway. I want to put some distance between us and that... body."  
船和他们离开时一样，当他们登上船时，明日香开口了。“真嗣，我希望你拿一个这个然后去睡一觉。你越快克服那个耳部感染，我们就越好。我可以带我们离开这里，继续前进。我想在我们和那……尸体之间拉开些距离。”

Still looking quite sick, Shinji agreed and allowed her to help him down below. Once he was safely in bed, and given a dose of antibiotic, Asuka headed above decks and set about casting off.  
尽管看起来依然病恹恹的，真嗣还是同意了，让她扶着他下到船舱。待他安全躺到床上，并服下抗生素后，明日香便回到甲板上，开始解缆起航。

It was not until she was well out to sea that she realized that she was very hungry and still had not eaten anything all day. While she sat at the helm, she wrote their location and disposition in the log. According to calculations, if they were to put in at Adan, Yemen, it would be about 20 days of sailing assuming they could keep up about 10 knots for half a day each day. Since they would not be sailing at night this would be a fair estimate. And with the tradewinds what they were this year, they could expect to do better than that. Perhaps even faster. They had enough stores to last that amount of time. Water was not a problem since they could purify water as they needed it. The real thing they would be short on is patience. It is bad enough to be cooped up in a car on a trip for 2 or 3 days, but a ship for nearly 20?  
直到她驶出远海，才意识到自己非常饥饿，一整天都没吃东西。她坐在舵轮旁，在航海日志中记录了他们的位置和状态。根据计算，如果他们要在也门的亚丁港停靠，假设每天能保持半天的 10 节航速，大约需要 20 天的航程。由于他们不会在夜间航行，这个估计是合理的。而且今年贸易风的情况良好，他们有望做得更好，甚至更快。他们的储备足够维持这段时间。水不是问题，因为他们可以根据需要净化海水。真正短缺的是耐心。在汽车里旅行两三天已经够糟糕了，但在船上将近 20 天呢？

It was doable. And it would shorten their trip. If they kept a heading of 282 degrees from Colombo, that would take them directly to an island off the coast of Yemen. Then it was a short leg from there to Adan. If they were really pressed, they could put in at Qadib or one of the other small towns on the island, otherwise they would make for the larger city.  
这是可行的。而且能缩短他们的旅程。如果他们从科伦坡保持 282 度的航向，就能直接抵达也门海岸外的一个岛屿。然后从那里到亚丁就是一段短途航程了。如果他们真的赶时间，可以在卡迪布或岛上的其他小镇停靠，否则他们会前往更大的城市。

Shinji appeared from below decks and shuffled his way toward her, while rubbing his head. His hair was sticking up in a couple of places and the sleepy look in his eyes was unmistakable.  
真嗣从甲板下出现，一边揉着头一边向她走来。他的头发在几个地方翘了起来，眼中那困倦的神情显而易见。

"You getting hungry, Asuka? I could eat a house. Or a horse. Or both." To accentuate his point, his stomach growled loudly.  
“你饿了吗，明日香？我简直能吃下一栋房子。或者一匹马。或者两者都吃。”为了强调他的观点，他的肚子大声咕噜起来。

"Yeah I am. Do we still have any of that instant ramen left? I know there is some frozen fish, I could fry it with some vegetables and put it in the soup. Maybe even use some of the eggs. Egg drop, fish and vegetable ramen sound good to you?" She smiled. She knew that it sounded very good to him. He had made that for her when she was recovering a while back, and had let on that it was his favorite.  
"是啊，我在。我们还有那种速食拉面吗？我知道还有一些冷冻鱼，我可以加点蔬菜一起煎，然后放进汤里。也许还可以用几个鸡蛋。蛋花鱼蔬拉面，你觉得怎么样？" 她微笑着。她知道这对他来说听起来非常美味。之前她恢复期间，他为她做过这道菜，并透露这是他的最爱。

"Mmm. Yeah. I think that would hit the spot. Want me to fix some?" He did his best to swallow a yawn but Asuka noticed anyhow.  
"嗯，是的。我觉得这正合我意。要我来做吗？" 他尽力忍住一个哈欠，但明日香还是注意到了。

"No way, Jose. You get back to bed, I'll fix it."  
"不行，何塞。你回床上躺着，我来弄。"

"Who is Jose?" “谁是何塞？”

"Get to bed you! And you better be asleep by the time I am done cooking!" The mock anger helped to bring a smile to Shinji's face, and he hurried as best he could to the stairs again.  
“快去睡觉！等我做完饭之前你最好已经睡着了！”那假装生气的语气让真嗣脸上露出了微笑，他尽可能快地再次向楼梯跑去。

"You want me to go to sleep just so you can wake me up again? Always do as the doctor orders."  
“你想让我睡觉只是为了再把我叫醒？总是听医生的话。”

Asuka finished out the log explaining their intended course of travel. Figuring their current food stores, they would easily last out the rest of the trip up to or maybe even after the Suez canal. Just to be sure she decided that it would be best to ration things a little bit. One never knows what problems they might encounter.  
明日香完成了记录，解释了他们计划的旅行路线。考虑到他们目前的粮食储备，他们可以轻松地支撑到苏伊士运河，甚至可能更久。为了确保万无一失，她决定最好稍微节约一点。谁也不知道会遇到什么问题。

Closing the book, she headed below as well and set about making their meal.  
合上书，她也下到了船舱，开始准备他们的餐食。

---

They say that experience is the best teacher. Neither Asuka not Shinji knew how true this was until they found themselves unprepared for true open ocean sailing. They had been making good time for the last week when what could only be a severe cyclonic storm found them. The day had dawned clear and bright, but close to noon, the sky began to get cluttered with clouds and in the distance there was a huge wall of clouds that curved away from them in both directions. At the time they had been heading straight for it, but as the day wore on, both realized that they would pass through the trailing edge of the immense storm. Asuka suggested veering north a little to try and miss it by a wider margin, but no sooner did they think they would be in the clear when it shifted its track and headed back their way. It was not until 5:00 PM that they really started feeling the winds off of it, and because of it's position relative to them the winds were helping.  
人们常说，经验是最好的老师。直到真正面对开阔海域的航行挑战时，明日香和真嗣才深刻体会到这句话的真谛。过去一周，他们的航程一直顺风顺水，直到一场猛烈的气旋风暴不期而至。清晨的天空还清澈明亮，临近正午时分，云层开始密集，远处一道巨大的云墙向两侧蜿蜒伸展。当时他们正直奔云墙而去，但随着时间推移，两人都意识到他们将穿过这场庞大风暴的尾端。明日香提议稍稍向北偏航，试图更大幅度地避开它，然而就在他们以为即将安然无恙时，风暴轨迹突变，再次朝他们逼近。直到下午五点，他们才真正感受到来自风暴的强风，由于风暴位置的相对关系，这些风反倒助了他们一臂之力。

Unfortunately the storm was getting closer despite their best efforts, and soon the wind was too much for the sails. A slow ripping sound pealed through the air, and Shinji, who had recovered from his infection enough to perform on deck again (according to Captain and Doctor Asuka's professional diagnosis), managed to get the sails down and started rolling and stowing them before more harm could be done.  
不幸的是，尽管他们尽了最大努力，风暴还是在逼近，很快风力就超出了船帆的承受范围。一阵缓慢的撕裂声划破空气，感染恢复到足以再次在甲板上工作的真嗣（根据船长和医生明日香的专业诊断）设法降下了船帆，并在造成更多损害之前开始卷起并存放它们。

"Do you think it will be alright? I mean we are about to go to a watery grave or what?" Shinji yelled to Asuka across the deck. Only 20 feet away and with the wind he could barely hear her reply.  
“你觉得我们会没事吗？我是说，我们是不是要葬身海底了？”真嗣在甲板上对着明日香大喊。尽管只有 20 英尺的距离，但风声让他几乎听不清她的回答。

"You got me, I think that in situations like this, they used to just batten down the hatches and take cover for the rest of the storm." Asuka looked worried, and that worried Shinji.  
“你问我，我也不知道，在这种时候，他们通常会紧闭舱口，躲起来等待风暴过去。”明日香看起来很担忧，这让真嗣也感到不安。

After a few more minutes of struggling work on deck, they went below, dripping wet, and both were quite cold. Having grown accustomed to each other as they had over the past few months, stripping out of the wet clothing together was no longer the nosebleed inducing act it used to be. It was still very exciting to Shinji, but he could handle it.  
在甲板上又挣扎了几分钟后，他们浑身湿透地下了船舱，两人都相当冷。经过过去几个月的相处，他们已经习惯了彼此，一起脱掉湿衣服不再像以前那样让人血脉贲张。对真嗣来说，这仍然非常刺激，但他能应付得来。

"Shinji? Can you get a blanket? I am going to make us some tea to warm up."  
“真嗣？你能拿条毯子吗？我要给我们泡点茶暖暖身子。”

Shinji hurried to do as she asked, and no sooner did she start pouring water into a pot than the ship rolled hard to starboard, then back to port, tossing them both about the cabin.  
真嗣赶紧按她说的去做，她刚把水倒进壶里，船就猛地向右舷倾斜，然后又向左舷回摆，把他们俩在船舱里甩来甩去。

"OK, no tea then.", she said disgustedly. Throwing the pot into the sink, she headed to the bed, where Shinji was busily spreading the blankets over the bed. They dried off with towels and climbed in, both of them taking comfort in the warmth and dryness of the bed. With the ship swaying, it was difficult to keep awake, so they started talking. Mostly they spoke of their route, what they might find when they get to NERV in Germany and other more trivial things. With the wind howling outside, the two spoke in whispers, for no other reason than that it felt more private.  
"好吧，那就不要茶了。" 她厌恶地说道。将茶壶扔进水槽，她走向床边，只见真嗣正忙着在床上铺开毯子。他们用毛巾擦干身体，爬上床，两人都因床上的温暖和干燥而感到舒适。随着船身摇晃，他们很难保持清醒，于是开始交谈。他们大多谈论着路线，到达德国 NERV 时可能会发现什么，以及其他更琐碎的事情。外面风声呼啸，两人低声细语，没有别的原因，只是这样感觉更私密。

"Shinji?" Asuka looked at him with her soft, almost sad eyes. Having grown accustomed to hard work and being outside, Shinji had filled out his previously skinny frail looking body. He had also grown taller. When she had met him, he was her height and probably weighed 55 kilograms, but now he was probably 8 centimeters taller and had gained 10 or more kilograms in muscle. He was also quite naked.  
"真嗣？" 明日香用她那柔和、几乎带着悲伤的眼神看着他。习惯了辛勤工作和户外生活，真嗣已经不再是之前那个瘦弱的样子，他的身体变得结实了。他也长高了。当她初次遇见他时，他跟她一样高，体重可能只有 55 公斤，但现在他大概高了 8 厘米，肌肉增加了 10 公斤以上。而且，他几乎是赤裸的。

"Mm hmm? What is it?"  
"嗯？什么事？"

"Do you love me? I mean.. I don't know what I mean..." She almost looked ashamed to him, tears welling in her eyes, waiting for the gentle nudge that would push them over the eyelashes and down onto her smooth silken cheeks.  
"你爱我吗？我是说...我不知道我到底想表达什么..." 她几乎在他面前显得有些羞愧，泪水在眼眶中打转，等待着那温柔的一触，让它们越过睫毛，滑落在她光滑如丝的面颊上。

"Hey. What is this? I love you. I love you very much. I have tried to show it, but I guess I am just not good at it. But I do love you, Asuka."  
"嘿。这是怎么了？我爱你。我非常爱你。我试图表达，但我想我做得不够好。但我确实爱你，明日香。"

She sniffed and was silent for a moment while she wiped the moisture in her eyes across the back of her hand. "I know. I just expected... wanted you to... Do you remember when we agreed not to have se... make love, Shinji? At the time I thought that it was all for valid reasons, but after the winter was over and the dangers were past, I wanted you to want me."  
她吸了吸鼻子，沉默了一会儿，用手背擦去眼角的湿润。"我知道。我只是期望...希望你能...你还记得我们约定不要发生...做爱，真嗣吗？当时我认为这都是出于合理的理由，但冬天过去，危险消退后，我希望你渴望我。"

Shinji changed position, laying on his side so that he could look squarely at her. Her lips were pursed while she thought and chose her words carefully. Her brow furrowed with the anxiety, tension and over-thinking that people do in such situations, mulling events over in their head like a mantra, until it becomes distorted.  
真嗣换了姿势，侧躺着以便能正视她。她抿着唇，思索并谨慎地挑选着词句。她的眉头因焦虑、紧张和过度思考而紧皱，在这种情境下，人们会将事件在脑海中反复琢磨，如同念诵咒语，直至变得扭曲。

Leaning forward he saw that she had also removed a particularly intriguing article of clothing. Her bare breasts were just visible under the hem of the covers. Then she lifted her head, and looked directly at him. It was the same Asuka, but it was a new look. She wanted him very badly, and he wanted her too.  
他倾身向前，发现她也脱下了一件特别引人注目的衣物。她的裸胸在被子边缘若隐若现。随后她抬起头，直视着他。依旧是那个明日香，但眼神却焕然一新。她渴望他，而他同样也渴望她。

The ship rocked violently to one side, and Shinji collided with Asuka, half on accident, half on purpose, and kissed her furiously. It had been extremely difficult for the two of them to contain themselves as they had for so long. You do not live with someone you love so much without sexual relations like that easily. He brushed his hands up and down her shoulders, causing her skin to break out in goose bumps, and leaned in for another kiss, this time wrapping his arms all the way around her.  
船猛地向一侧倾斜，真嗣与明日香撞在一起，半是无意，半是有意，他狂热地吻了她。对于他们两人来说，长时间压抑自己极其困难。与深爱的人同住却不发生那样的关系，实在不易。他双手在她肩上来回抚摸，引得她皮肤泛起鸡皮疙瘩，随后又贴近她，这次用双臂紧紧环抱住她，再次亲吻。

With the storm raging outside, the storm that was sexual frustration was raging inside the boat. They did not separate for a very long time, but neither were they active that whole time. Some things, like the first experience of the most sublime example of romantic love, should be taken slowly and savored... several times.  
外面风暴肆虐，船内则是性压抑的风暴。他们许久未曾分开，但那段时间里也并未有所行动。有些事情，比如初次体验那至高无上的浪漫爱情，应当慢慢来，细细品味……不止一次。

Afterwards they both slept, Asuka still draped halfway over Shinji, and it was not until the storm had subsided outside that the two of them awoke.  
事后，两人都睡着了，明日香仍半趴在真嗣身上，直到外面的风暴平息，他们才醒来。

Afterword- (April 2004) 后记-（2004 年 4 月）

I apologize for being so long in writing this. For the last couple of months I have been extremely busy. For the entire month of January I was at an Army school (PLDC- Primary Leadership Development Course) then for February, March, and so far through April, I was preparing to deploy to Afghanistan. Soon I will be gone, but I am certain I will have internet access over there, and so I might just be capable of continuing to write. With my increased responsibilities as an NCO (Non-Commissioned Officer) I have less free time than I used to. But, once I have trained my privates (soldiers not parts *S*) I think I will have a bit less of a workload. Thanks to all of those of you who put reviews on my stories, you are the ones that keep me coming back (albeit after long hiatus). And please, if you ask questions in your reviews, please leave an e-mail address that I can respond to. I can't answer very well otherwise.  
我为耽搁了这么久才写这封信而道歉。过去几个月我异常忙碌。整个一月份，我都在陆军学校（PLDC——初级领导力发展课程）度过，而二月、三月，乃至至今的四月，我一直在为派往阿富汗做准备。不久后我将离开，但我确信在那边能上网，因此或许还能继续写作。作为 NCO（非委任军官），我的职责加重，自由时间比以往少。不过，一旦训练好我的新兵（士兵，不是零件*笑*），我想工作量会减轻些。感谢所有在我故事下留言评论的朋友们，是你们让我不断回归（尽管间隔漫长）。若在评论中提问，请留下可回复的电子邮件地址，否则我难以妥善答复。

I seem to remember someone asking how I knew so much about things like power plants, guns, large scale UPS systems etc. I am in the US Army. I entered service on 17APR98 as an Infantryman. It was a good job, and I got exposed to a lot of neat stuff. There are things that you can learn in the Infantry that you cannot learn so easily in many other places.  
我似乎记得有人问过我，怎么会对电厂、枪械、大型不间断电源系统等事物了解如此之多。我隶属于美国陆军，于 1998 年 4 月 17 日作为步兵入伍。那是一份不错的工作，让我接触到了许多有趣的东西。在步兵部队，你能学到许多在其他地方难以轻易获得的知识。

I spent three years in the Infantry, and that nearly broke me. My body was not built for it. I could probably last another year or so before I would be physically unable to hack it. So I reclassified to Imagery Analysis in Intelligence. I look at satellite pictures. When learning about say power plants for example, they show you in a classroom what all of these different types of power plants look like on imagery and how they work, then you go tour one to see what all happens there. All of that information is good to know since it may come in useful hen looking at something like that on imagery.  
我在步兵部队服役了三年，那几乎让我崩溃。我的身体并不适合那样的生活。我可能还能再撑个一两年，但身体终将无法承受。因此，我转岗到了情报部门的影像分析岗位。我的工作是分析卫星图片。比如在学习电厂相关知识时，他们会在教室里教你各种电厂在影像上的外观及其运作原理，然后带你实地参观，了解整个流程。这些信息都很有用，因为在分析影像时可能会派上用场。

Anyhow, I will do my best to continue this while I am in country. I also plan to continue my education and maybe get in better shape. I am already in pretty good shape due to the PT I have to do, but it is not enough, and I don't have much time to do more in my free hours. I will catch you all on the other side. Those of you that pray, pray for me and the other guys overseas. With what current events are, we need luck and prayer power as much as we need beans and bullets.  
无论如何，我会在国内期间尽全力继续这项工作。我还计划继续深造，并可能提升自己的体能。由于必须进行的体能训练，我的状态已经相当不错，但这还不够，而且我在空闲时间也没有太多机会做更多锻炼。我们改日再会。那些祈祷的朋友们，请为我及海外的伙伴们祈祷。鉴于当前的形势，我们既需要运气和祈祷的力量，也需要弹药和补给。

### Chapter 15 The Road to Berlin

Having survived Third Impact, wild animals, a fairly harsh winter, everyday life, and the rigors of love, Shinji and Asuka were glad to put the storm behind them. Of course, they had only caught the beginning of it. After several days of calm waters and steady breeze, they made landfall in Adan, and picked up what supplies they could.  
经历了第三次冲击、野生动物、严冬、日常生活以及爱情的考验后，真嗣和明日香很高兴能将风暴抛在身后。当然，他们只是刚刚开始。在平静的海面和稳定的风势持续了几天后，他们在阿丹登陆，并尽可能地补充了补给。

Drinking water was running low since a heating element had burned out on the electric water reclamation system that had been installed on the boat. It was a remarkable device, but just that one simple part had left it dead weight. Unfortunately there were no replacements to be found in the town. They stayed in Adan for 2 days while they shopped around. It would be nearly another week up the Red Sea, then through the Suez Canal, then a few days to Italy. But first, some relaxation away from the water.  
由于船上的电动水回收系统的一个加热元件烧坏了，饮用水供应变得紧张。这个设备非常出色，但就是那个简单的部件让它成了无用之物。不幸的是，镇上找不到替换零件。他们在阿丹停留了两天四处寻找。接下来还要在红海上航行近一周，然后穿过苏伊士运河，再到意大利还需要几天时间。但首先，他们需要远离水域，放松一下。

Luckily there was plenty of local type food around. Undoubtedly the locals had packed everything with a lot of preservatives. Shelf stable flatbread and ready made dishes to serve with it abounded. And amazingly it tasted good. The preservatives used in this part of the world undoubtedly were better than those used in a lot of Japanese foods.  
幸运的是，周围有很多当地的食物。毫无疑问，当地人用了很多防腐剂来保存食物。货架稳定的扁平面包和与之搭配的即食菜肴随处可见。而且令人惊讶的是，这些食物味道很好。这个地区使用的防腐剂无疑比许多日本食品中使用的要好。

When they did get back underway, they made good time. The Red Sea was calm and did not offer much in the way of excitement. It was during these days of boredom that Shinji and Asuka filled their time with each other. While they knew each other quite well, they found that being intimate brought you closer to another person that you can ever be otherwise. It amazed them that people could be so frivolous with their affections. That lovemaking could be a momentary encounter for people rather than a lasting bond.  
当他们再次启程时，航行进展顺利。红海风平浪静，并未带来太多刺激。正是在这些无聊的日子里，真嗣和明日香彼此相伴度过了时光。虽然他们彼此了解颇深，但他们发现亲密无间能让人比其他任何方式都更接近对方。这让他们惊叹，人们竟能如此轻率地对待感情。他们认为，做爱本应是持久的关系，而非短暂的邂逅。

With the water so calm, they found it much easier than it had been during the storm. Of course it was much warmer so quite often they had to stop due to the heat.  
由于水面如此平静，他们发现这比暴风雨期间要容易得多。当然，天气也更加温暖，因此他们经常因为炎热而不得不停下来。

One morning Shinji woke up and found Asuka on the foredeck, looking at the approaching locks of the canal through binoculars. There was a lot hinging on the canal still being in working or salvageable order. If it was not, they would either have to scrap the trip for this year and hole up somewhere, or attempt to make it around Africa, thus adding a lot more time to the journey. It was roughly 11 thousand nautical miles, which traveling at the leisurely pace they had been going would cost them a little under 2 months. Needless to say it was pretty important that they make it through the canal.  
一天早晨，真嗣醒来，发现明日香在前甲板上，正用双筒望远镜观察着逐渐接近的运河闸门。运河是否还能正常工作或修复，关系重大。如果不能，他们要么得取消今年的行程，找个地方躲起来，要么就得尝试绕过非洲，这样会大大增加旅途时间。大约有 11000 海里，以他们悠闲的行进速度，将耗费近两个月。不言而喻，通过运河对他们来说至关重要。

As they approached, Shinji wiped the sleep out of his eyes. Asuka heard him yawn, and turned around and hugged him.  
当他们靠近时，真嗣揉了揉惺忪的睡眼。明日香听到他的哈欠声，转过身来拥抱了他。

"How are you feeling this morning?" she asked him. His face was still a little puffy and he had creases on his face where he laid on the sheets.  
“今天早上感觉怎么样？”她问他。他的脸还有些浮肿，脸上留着枕在床单上的压痕。

"Ugh… Sometimes I hate waking up. Sleeping feels so good." Shinji replied issuing another yawn. "That is not to say that other things don't feel good too." One had to be careful around Asuka sometimes.  
"呃…有时候我真讨厌醒来。睡觉的感觉太好了。" 真嗣回答道，又打了个哈欠。"这并不是说其他事情感觉不好。" 有时候在明日香身边得小心点。

"Well it is good that you woke up when you did. We are almost there. This looks like it will be a bit of an adventure. The outer lock is up, and I don't know anything about opening, closing and flooding locks."  
"还好你及时醒了。我们快到了。看来这将是一次小小的冒险。外舱门已经打开，我对如何开关和注水一无所知。"

"It'll be OK. When we get close, we can lower the sails and use the motor to edge us up to the pier out there. Did you see a control house or anything?" Shinji asked squinting against the bright sun to see what the lay of the canal was.  
"没事的。等我们靠近时，可以把帆降下来，用马达慢慢靠近那边的码头。你看到控制室或者什么设施了吗？" 真嗣眯着眼睛，迎着明亮的阳光观察运河的布局。

"There are a couple of buildings up a road from the pier. Other than that I don't know. One of them could be it."  
从码头沿路往上走，有几栋建筑。除此之外我不清楚。其中一栋可能就是。

It only took a few more minutes to close with the pier, and they had the sails down and move up and secured the boat to the pier. Every time they got off of the boat it felt weird for the first few minutes walking around. It almost felt like the ground was moving. They had gotten so used to the deck of the boat moving that they expected it.  
没过几分钟，他们就靠近了码头，降下帆，将船系好。每次下船，最初几分钟走路都感觉怪怪的，仿佛地面在移动。他们已经习惯了船甲板的摇晃，以至于对此有了预期。

The short trek up the hill to the buildings was pleasant. This part of the area was quite green compared to a lot of the land that they had passed along the Red Sea. This was watered by the Nile River delta, and stayed lush and green all the time. In the wood line to their left birds called out and small animals made various noises. The grass was high around the buildings and one of the walls had already fallen down.  
沿着小山坡走向那些建筑的短暂路程颇为愉快。这一带比他们穿越红海时经过的许多地方都要绿意盎然。这里得益于尼罗河三角洲的灌溉，始终保持着葱郁的绿色。左侧的林木中，鸟儿鸣叫，小动物发出各种声响。建筑周围的草丛茂密，其中一面墙已经倒塌。

It took a while looking around, but they found the control room for this lock and two others down the way. The bad news was that there was no power for the lock doors. The good news was that there was a mechanical way of opening and closing each one. Stairs leading down from the control rooms went to a series of pressure valves, that when released would open each set of doors. Once in the lock they could release another valve that would let water out of the lock, thus lowering the ship to the sea level of the Mediterranean.  
他们四处寻找了一番，终于找到了这个锁以及沿途另外两个锁的控制室。坏消息是这些锁门没有电力供应。好消息则是每个锁门都有机械方式可以开关。从控制室下来的楼梯通向一系列压力阀，释放这些阀门就能打开每组门。一旦进入锁内，他们可以再释放另一个阀门，让锁内的水排出，从而将船降到地中海的海平面。

"How about this, Shinji? I can go back and pull the boat into the lock, while you open it. Once I am in, you can pump the water, then get back on board, and we can sail to the far end of the canal, then you can open the doors there too."  
“这样如何，真嗣？我可以回去把船拉进锁里，你来开门。我进去后，你再抽水，然后回到船上，我们可以驶向运河的另一端，到时你也可以打开那里的门。”

"I thought you said you wanted to operate the controls." Shinji replied slyly.  
“我记得你说过你想操作控制台。”真嗣狡黠地回答道。

"I did, but I think that you would be able to do it much better than I. Besides, what do I know about valves and pumps and stuff?" she asked in mock confusion. She knew exactly what Shinji knew about it.  
"我确实知道，但我觉得你能做得比我好得多。再说了，我对阀门、泵这些东西了解多少呢？" 她故作困惑地问道。她其实很清楚真嗣对此的了解。

Smiling, he replied "Fine, get on back to Sloop John B."  
他微笑着回答：“好吧，回到《Sloop John B》去吧。”

"Sloop John B.? What do you mean?"  
“《Sloop John B.》？你是什么意思？”

"You never heard that Beach Boys song?"  
"你没听过那首海滩男孩的歌吗？"

Asuka looked at him semi-astounded. "No, and I am surprised that you would have. You don't listen to the Beach Boys."  
明日香半是惊讶地看着他。“没有，我倒是惊讶你居然会知道。你又不听海滩男孩的歌。”

"No, but I have heard that song. It's kind of funny. Took me a while to figure out what it is about, but it is funny." He kissed her and waved her away. Within 10 minutes the boat was underway and he released the valve. Pent up water pressure worked the mechanisms and hydraulic rams forcing the gates open. Water rushed into the lock, and Shinji realized that he would not have to pump anything after all. He went back up the stairs and out on to the side of the lock, and followed the boat as it traveled toward the gates.  
“不，但我确实听过那首歌。挺有意思的。我花了些时间才搞明白它讲的是什么，不过确实挺有趣。”他吻了她一下，挥手让她离开。不到十分钟，船就启航了，他打开了阀门。积聚的水压驱动着机械装置和液压活塞，迫使闸门打开。水流涌入闸室，真嗣意识到自己根本不需要抽水。他回到楼梯上，走到闸室的一侧，跟随船只向闸门驶去。

Asuka was standing at the helm, and watched the gates open. As she got closer they stopped, and they were not even halfway open. Judging from the width of the ship, it was going to be tight, if it even happened at all.  
明日香站在船舵旁，注视着闸门缓缓开启。当她靠近时，闸门停了下来，甚至还没开到一半。从船的宽度来看，即便能通过，也会非常勉强。

Shinji saw it coming, and ran over to where the gate attached to the side. There was a ratchet cable that could be used to pull the gate back a little. It was not designed to open it more than a few feet.  
真嗣预见到了这一幕，迅速跑到闸门连接船侧的地方。那里有一根棘轮缆绳，可以用来稍微拉回闸门。但它设计之初就只能再开几英尺。

"Slow the boat Asuka, I need to open it a little more!" But judging from its speed he knew she would not be able to stop it in time. She had already sprung the sail lines, and they were falling to the deck. But a ship that size does not exactly stop on a dime. He hurried to the cable, and started working the lever to pull the cable along, and in turn pulling the gate back his way. It was very heavy, and Shinji was sure that last year at this time he would not have been able to do it. The rubber grip on the lever had finger shaped divots on it to keep it from slipping from his fingers, but his hands started sweating immediately and he held on to it as well he could, hauling on it back and forth. From his end it did not look like it was doing much. He managed to move the door open another 10 feet by the time he boat came through however. It was still a tight fit, and he saw Asuka maneuvering to the concrete edge of the canal once she cleared the gate fully.  
"慢点开船，Asuka，我需要再打开一点！" 但从它的速度来看，他知道她无法及时停下。她已经解开了帆索，帆布正飘落到甲板上。但那样一艘大船不可能说停就停。他急忙赶到缆绳旁，开始操作杠杆拉动缆绳，进而将闸门向他这边拉回。它非常沉重，Shinji 确信如果是在去年这个时候，他肯定做不到。杠杆上的橡胶握把有指形凹槽，以防滑脱，但他的手立刻开始出汗，他尽可能紧紧握住，来回拉动。从他这边看，似乎没起多大作用。不过，当船通过时，他设法将门又打开了 10 英尺。尽管如此，这仍然是个紧贴的缝隙，他看到 Asuka 在完全通过闸门后，正操纵着船向运河的混凝土边缘靠拢。

"That was good work Shinji. I'm sorry; I should not have set all of the sails. I should have known that it was not going to be so easy."  
"干得不错，Shinji。对不起，我不该一下子把所有帆都升起来。我应该知道这不会那么简单。"

"It's OK. The big thing is that we are that much closer. Assuming that the far gates opened enough, we should be OK." He hugged Asuka. "That was good work on your part too. You make a good sailor. I might just put you on full time." He grinned at her, and she smiled back.  
"没事的。重要的是我们又近了一步。假设远方的门开得足够大，我们应该没问题。" 他拥抱了明日香。"你那边也干得不错。你是个好水手。我可能会让你全职上岗。" 他朝她咧嘴一笑，她也回以微笑。

"You think we're gonna make it through this alright?"  
"你觉得我们能顺利度过这次难关吗？"

"What do you mean? You don't?" Shinji looked at her confused.  
"你什么意思？你不这么认为吗？" 真嗣困惑地看着她。

"No, it's not that, I just… I would never have imagined doing anything like this. It is so different from anything that I have done, and it's like we are playing things by ear."  
"不，不是那样的，我只是……我从没想过会做这样的事。这和我以前做的任何事情都截然不同，感觉我们就像是在即兴发挥。"

"That is exactly what we are doing." Shinji hopped on board the Sloop John B. He would have to christen it properly soon. But then they would be abandoning it soon enough. Maybe he should just skip it. "And it works well enough I think"  
"这正是我们在做的。" 真嗣跳上了 Sloop John B 号。他本该尽快为它举行正式的命名仪式。但很快他们就要弃船而去。也许他应该跳过这一步。"我觉得效果还不错。"

"Yeah, but we're amazingly lucky. Have you ever thought that?" Asuka pushed off of the concrete seawall and set about raising the sails again.  
"是啊，但我们真是太幸运了。你有没有想过这一点？" 明日香从混凝土防波堤上推开，开始重新升起船帆。"

"Lucky? Some of it maybe, but I think we have made our way here by some hard work and using our brains too. And some initiative. We could have just as easily stayed on that beach and died of exposure or some animal or something. To tell you the truth, for a while there, I was impartial to that idea too."  
"幸运？或许有一点，但我认为我们能走到这里，靠的是辛勤努力和智慧。还有些主动性。我们本可以轻易地留在那片海滩上，死于暴露或某种动物之类的。说实话，有那么一阵子，我也对那个想法不置可否。"

Asuka looked at Shinji seriously and thought his words over carefully. "What made you act?"  
明日香认真地看着真嗣，仔细思考着他的话。"你为什么决定行动？"

"You did. I thought about things for a long time, and decided that I could not leave you alone. I didn't want you to end it, and I needed to be with someone."  
"因为你。我思考了很久，决定不能让你独自一人。我不希望你结束一切，我需要有人陪伴。"

Asuka experienced a flash of anger but suppressed it. Shinji had not felt the same way for her at that time, and she hadn't loved him either, so she should not be surprised at his admission. "I love you, Shinji."  
明日香心头一怒，却又强压下去。那时真嗣对她并无同样情感，而她亦未曾爱过他，故对他的坦白不应感到意外。“我爱你，真嗣。”

They sailed for some time watching the canal pass by. It emptied into a large lake that resumed the canal on the far side. In the exit end of the canal, they had no difficulty since it was already open, obviously left that way when the people controlling it had been taken. Navigating back into open water, they starting working on the last leg of their journey.  
他们航行了一段时间，观赏着运河两岸的风景。运河最终汇入一片宽阔的湖泊，又在彼岸重新接续。在运河的出口处，他们并未遇到困难，显然是当初控制这里的人被带走时未曾关闭。驶回开阔水域后，他们便着手进行最后一段旅程。

"Ok, turn to port heading 301 degrees. We have about 900 nautical miles, so open her all the way up. The wind is with us, so we should pass Cyprus late tomorrow, and be in Italy no later than 3 days from now." Asuka beamed. Traveling was so much fun for her, especially with Shinji. They spent a lot of time with each other, and little had she known that he could be so interesting, not to mention sweet if you could get to know him well enough. She almost wished that the journey would never end. They could continue on like this indefinitely, right? See the world, and go wherever they wanted. Of course, they had talked about children. And with that came the need to settle into one place and make life predictable.  
“好的，转向左舷，航向 301 度。我们大约有 900 海里，所以全速前进。顺风而行，我们应该能在明天深夜经过塞浦路斯，最迟三天内到达意大利。” 明日香笑得灿烂。旅行对她来说乐趣无穷，尤其是和真嗣一起。他们共度了许多时光，她几乎不知道他可以如此有趣，更不用说如果你足够了解他的话，他还有那么甜蜜的一面。她几乎希望这段旅程永远不会结束。他们可以这样无限期地继续下去，对吧？看看世界，去任何他们想去的地方。当然，他们也谈到了孩子。随之而来的是需要在一个地方安定下来，让生活变得可预测。

But then, life was predictable on board the ship, right? With a baby it would be tight quarters though. And with another mouth to feed they would be stopping more often. Plus the pregnancy would complicate things. Sigh  
但话说回来，在船上的生活本来就是可预测的，对吧？不过，有了宝宝，空间就会变得很紧张。而且多了一张嘴要喂，他们会更频繁地停靠。再加上怀孕会带来各种复杂情况。唉

That night they had ramen left over from Japan with some chicken and vegetables added. It had grown cooler in the afternoon after clouding up and turning overcast and the soup did well to warm them up. They talked animatedly about all sorts of things that they missed from their old life. Shinji could not think of that many things, but Asuka helped. When Shinji said that he was happier now, after Third Impact, than he was before, she sat next to him, and he held her close. A little soup was left in her bowl, and it got cold while she leaned against him.  
那晚，他们吃的是从日本带回来的拉面，加了一些鸡肉和蔬菜。下午云层密布，天气转凉，这碗热汤正好暖身。他们兴致勃勃地聊着过去生活中的点点滴滴。真嗣想不起太多，但明日香帮他回忆。当真嗣说他在第三次冲击后比以前更快乐时，明日香坐在他身边，他紧紧拥抱着她。她的碗里还剩了一点汤，在她靠在他身上时已经凉了。

For a long time neither moved, until Shinji turned his head, and breathed deeply of her hair. He smelled her neck to. God she smelled good. And she was warm too. He put his cold hands down at her sides, and quickly under her shirt, and she jumped with the shock of the frozen fingers on her waist.  
很长一段时间内，两人都没有动，直到真嗣转过头，深深地吸了一口她的发香。他还闻了闻她的脖子。天哪，她闻起来真香。而且她也很温暖。他把手放在她身侧，迅速伸进她的衬衫里，她因为冰冷的手指触碰到腰间而惊跳起来。

Twisting and squirming, she managed to get away from him, but as soon as she was, she twisted around instead of escaping, she lunged at him, kissing him, and bearing him down on the bench there in the dining room. The boat slowly rocked back and forth, and the dimming light made her eyes shine just a little bit as she looked down at him.  
她扭动着身体，设法挣脱了他，但刚一挣脱，她反而转身扑向他，亲吻着他，将他压在餐厅的长椅上。船缓缓地摇晃着，昏暗的光线让她的眼睛微微闪烁，她低头看着他。

She looked him over with a crooked smile. "You know, your hair is getting a little lighter," she said, running her fingers through his now collar length hair. "and I think I like it long like this. Much better than short the way it was. Are you going to let it keep growing?"  
她带着一丝歪斜的微笑打量着他。“你知道吗，你的头发变浅了些，”她说着，手指穿过他如今及领长度的发丝。“我觉得这样长挺好的。比之前短的时候好多了。你会让它继续长吗？”

"I think I will. I've never had long hair before, and I think I'll try it." He looked up at this woman who had captured him and smiled. "I think I like you on top like that."  
“我想我会试试。我以前从未留过长发，我觉得可以尝试一下。”他抬头看着这位俘获了他的心的女人，微笑着。“我觉得你那样在上面的样子挺好的。”

She leaned forward and kissed him briefly, then butted his head with her own. "You and me both." she said getting up. She sat on the other side of the bench at the table, studying him, and wondered about how she had fallen for him. Was it inevitable that a couple will fall in love if left long enough? Or was there something from the start? Or was it just blind luck? Or was this some kind of divine happening?  
她倾身轻轻吻了他一下，然后用额头轻碰他的头。“我们俩都这么想。”她起身说道。她坐在桌子另一边的长凳上，凝视着他，思索着自己是如何爱上他的。是不是只要时间足够长，一对情侣就注定会相爱？还是从一开始就有什么特别之处？抑或是纯粹的盲目的幸运？还是说这是某种神圣的安排？

For the next couple of hours they talked and played around. You would be amazed at how much there is to talk about when that is all you have to do.  
接下来的几个小时里，他们聊天、嬉戏。当你只能做这些时，你会发现有太多话题可聊，这会让你大吃一惊。

The moon had just crested the horizon, and started its inevitable voyage across the sky, when they decided to retire to the bedroom for sleep and other activities.  
月亮刚刚升起在地平线上，开始了它不可避免的横跨天空之旅，这时他们决定回卧室睡觉和进行其他活动。

The next two days were fairly uneventful. They passed within sight of Cyprus, and Shinji managed to land a fish that they did not know the name of. It was nearly 30 pounds and after cleaning yielded them enough meat for several meals.  
接下来的两天相当平静。他们经过了塞浦路斯，真嗣还钓到了一条他们不知其名的鱼。这条鱼重达近 30 磅，清理后为他们提供了好几顿饭的肉量。

It was a fine time for both of them. When there was nothing else to do, they could lie out on the deck and catch the sun, which took up a lot of the time, and plan the rest of their trip through Europe.  
对他们两人来说，这是个美好的时光。当无事可做时，他们可以躺在甲板上晒太阳，这占据了大部分时间，并计划着穿越欧洲的其余旅程。

On their current course, they could land in Taranto, Italy and offload, and take directly to the road. Then once they got out of the city, they could take the highways north, or go on the smaller roads and see the countryside.  
按照目前的航线，他们可以在意大利的塔兰托登陆卸货，然后直接上路。一旦离开城市，他们可以选择北上高速公路，或者走小路欣赏乡村风光。

The wind picked up on the second day out from Suez and they made better time than they had expected. Early morning on the third day the GPS alarm went off indicating that they were within 20 miles of their destination.  
从苏伊士出发的第二天，风力增强，他们的行进速度比预期要快。第三天清晨，GPS 警报响起，显示他们距离目的地仅剩 20 英里。

Shinji, always being a light sleeper awoke first, and turned off the alarm, then shook Asuka, who had been wedging her face between his neck and the pillow, until she awoke too. "Hey, we are almost there. Can you come up and help me on deck?"  
总是浅睡的 Shinji 最先醒来，关掉了闹钟，然后摇醒了把脸挤在他脖子和枕头之间的 Asuka。“嘿，我们快到了。你能上来帮我到甲板上吗？”

She grunted her assent, and squinting raised her head. "Ugh, what time is it?"  
她咕哝着表示同意，眯着眼睛抬起头。“呃，几点了？”

"Nearly 6:00." “快六点了。”

Asuka yawned and complained about the time, then got up and followed Shinji up the stairs. It was already getting light and in the distance they could see a darkening that could very well be their destination.  
明日香打了个哈欠，抱怨着时间，然后起身跟着真嗣上楼。天色已渐亮，远处他们能看到一片逐渐变暗的区域，很可能就是他们的目的地。

It still took another two hours to reach the port, and the day had dawned clear and warm. While Shinji brought the sails down and put them away, Asuka engaged the motor, and eased the boat into port. Berthing slips where easy enough to find, and with little difficulty, Asuka maneuvered them into one. Shinji was busily tying the mooring lines down to cleats when Asuka snuck up and jumped him from behind!  
尽管如此，他们还是花了两个小时才到达港口，而此时天已放晴，温暖宜人。真嗣忙着降帆并收好，明日香则启动了马达，缓缓将船驶入港口。停泊位并不难找，明日香轻松地将船停靠在一个泊位上。真嗣正忙着将系泊绳系在系船柱上，这时明日香悄悄靠近，从背后跳到他身上！

"Oooh! I am so excited. It feels like I have been gone for years! Finally back in Europe and just down the road from Germany too!"  
“哦！我太兴奋了。感觉好像离开了好几年！终于回到欧洲了，而且离德国也不远！”

Shinji, whose heart rate was starting to come down again grinned. "Just down the road? It is still more than a thousand miles away. But we will get there pretty quick I think. Do you want to take the highways there or go the scenic route?" Shinji finished off the last mooring and they went back below decks.  
心跳逐渐平复的绫波露出了微笑。“就在路的那头？那可还有一千多英里呢。不过我想我们能很快到达。你想走高速公路还是风景路线？”绫波解开最后一个系泊，两人回到了甲板下。

"Well I kind of want to take it easy, but if you want to get there quick that's fine. It is not that big a deal for me."  
“我其实想慢慢来，但如果你急着到那儿，那也没关系。对我来说不是什么大问题。”

"I think I want to go ahead and get there. We can see Europe all we want later on, right?" Asuka nodded, and they started looking through the stored supplies.  
“我想还是先到那儿吧。以后有的是时间看遍欧洲，对吧？”明日香点头同意，两人开始翻找储存的物资。

Everything had survived without too much mishap. A flashlight had been left on and of course the gas in the motorcycles would have to be treated. It took about an hour to get everything out and unpacked. Asuka stared at her cherry hardwood looking Indian motorcycle. It would feel good to get on the road again, even if it was only for a five or six days. Shinji was cinching down the gear to his own motorcycle.  
一切都在没有太多意外的情况下幸存了下来。一个手电筒被遗忘在开启状态，当然摩托车的汽油也需要处理。大约花了一个小时才把所有东西搬出来并拆包。明日香凝视着她那辆樱桃木纹的印度摩托车。再次上路的感觉一定很好，即使只是为期五到六天。真嗣正在给自己的摩托车系紧装备。

Asuka turned to the boat. "Well boat, I am going to miss you. You brought us a heck of a long way." A long way around the Earth, and a long way in their relationship too.  
明日香转向那艘船。“好吧，船，我会想念你的。你带我们走了很长一段路。”绕地球一圈的漫长旅程，也是他们关系中的漫长旅程。

"You know if you want, we can find someplace to hoist it out of the water or dry dock it or something. We may want to go somewhere else someday." Shinji said looking up from his work.  
“你知道，如果你想，我们可以找个地方把它从水里吊起来或者干坞它什么的。也许有一天我们想去别的地方。”真嗣一边工作一边抬头说道。

"No, I have the feeling that we are going to be here for good." She smiled down at him, and finished putting gear on her motorcycle as well. Within an hour they had searched the boat for anything else they wanted, then closed it up, said their goodbyes again, and headed out.  
“不，我有种感觉，我们将会永远留在这里。”她低头对他微笑，并继续为她的摩托车装上装备。不到一小时，他们已经搜遍了船上想要的东西，然后再次道别，启程离开。

According to the route they had plotted, once they got out of town they could take the A-14, which would turn in the A22 later on. From there the highway would lead them right up to Berlin. From there, Asuka could lead the way into the NERV facility.  
根据他们规划的路线，一旦离开城镇，他们可以走 A-14 公路，之后会转入 A22 公路。从那里，高速公路将直接引领他们前往柏林。到了那里，明日香可以带领他们进入 NERV 设施。

And so, leaving their unnamed boat behind, the two set out for their destination by land. It would be roughly 1200 miles, and who knows how the roads had fared. There was little indication of how the winter had been this past year. It was only mid April and already it was starting to get pretty hot.  
于是，两人舍弃了那艘无名之船，陆路向目的地进发。这段路程大约 1200 英里，谁知道路况如何。过去一年的冬天情况如何几乎没有迹象。现在才四月中旬，天气已经开始变得相当炎热。

The road to Berlin would be relatively short. They were both anxious to find out what awaited them there. Asuka would see her home again, and could saw what farewells she could to her family. Only time would tell what good or ill their journey might bring.  
通往柏林的路途相对短暂。两人都急切地想知道那里等待着他们的是什么。明日香将重返故土，并尽可能地与家人告别。唯有时间能揭示他们的旅程将带来何种吉凶。

### Chapter 16 Time Capsule

The first leg of the journey took them north along the eastern coast of Italy. The followed the coastal highway for nearly 600 km before leaving the coast and heading toward Austria, the Alps and the rest of Central Europe. It was on the second day of the ride that they started ascending. At the bottom it was just a little warm, but as they climbed higher into the mountains, it chilled. They stopped twice on their ascent to put on extra clothing. Riding in a car would have been different, but exposed to the air (and rushing air to boot) made for some chilly riding.  
旅程的第一段带他们沿着意大利东海岸向北行进。他们沿着海岸公路行驶了近 600 公里后，才离开海岸线，朝着奥地利、阿尔卑斯山脉及中欧其余地区进发。在骑行的第二天，他们开始攀登。山脚下只是略微温暖，但随着他们越爬越高，气温逐渐变冷。他们在攀登过程中停下来两次，穿上更多衣物。若是驾车行驶，感受定会不同，但暴露在空气中（尤其是疾风中）使得骑行变得颇为寒冷。

There was snow on the peaks, and occasional patches on the northern faces of the mountains. As they rode they saw all manner of wildlife. Deer, rabbit, wolf. Through Italy they passed many towns on their way through the mountains. Some were small, others were pretty large. Shinji was surprised at the sea of red roofs that greeted them each time they came to another town. While not every one was red tile, the vast majority were.  
山峰上覆盖着积雪，偶尔在山脉的北侧也能见到雪迹。他们骑行时，目睹了各种各样的野生动物。鹿、兔、狼。穿越意大利的途中，他们经过了许多山间小镇。有些很小，有些则相当大。每次抵达新的小镇，迎接他们的是一片片红色的屋顶，这让真嗣感到惊讶。虽然并非每个小镇都是红色瓦片，但绝大多数都是如此。

They had lunch on the side of the road in Bolzano. It was cool, and they ate a cold lunch. The valley spread out below them, and nestled in the middle was a small stream or river (Shinji could not be sure which) with a small community situated across it. Farms and fields checkerboarded the valley growing who knows what. Soft puffy which clouds were moving along at a good clip, sometimes engulfing a mountaintop. To say the least it was beautiful countryside.  
他们在博尔扎诺的路边吃了午餐。天气凉爽，他们享用了冷餐。山谷在他们脚下展开，中间蜿蜒着一条小溪或河流（真嗣无法确定是哪一种），溪流两岸坐落着一个小社区。农田和田野像棋盘一样分布在山谷中，种植着不知名的作物。柔软蓬松的云朵快速移动，时而吞没山顶。毫不夸张地说，这是一片美丽的乡村风光。

A few kilometers up the road, Asukas motorcycle started riding rough, so they stopped. The rear tire had a flat. They spent an hour riding through Bolzano looking for a motorcycle shop, located one and spent the rest of the afternoon replacing the rear tire. That night, they stayed in the office of the shop, then set out the next morning.  
几公里后，明日香摩托车开始颠簸，于是他们停了下来。后轮胎漏气了。他们在博尔扎诺骑行了一个小时寻找摩托车店，找到一家并花了一下午更换后轮胎。当晚，他们就住在店里，第二天一早又出发了。

They passed through Austria and into Germany that day. German roads were very well engineered. It must have been the middle of the night here when Third Impact took place. There was much less wreched traffic and they could open up the throttle a bit more making very good time. Asuka started pointing out places of interest when they passed, Munich, Ingolstadt, Nuremburg and the like. There were towns every where. Large towns with many smaller ones taking up the area between them. Forms and fields, forests, rivers. It was a beautiful country. During the day of their trek, they strayed off of the highway at the outskirts of Berlin, and circled south and east of the city. The Berlin branch of NERV was located to the east about 20 km. A large highway had been constructed leading directly into the facility, which like its Tokyo-3 cousin, was situated underground.  
那天，他们穿越奥地利进入德国。德国的道路工程非常完善。第三次冲击发生时，这里应该是深夜。交通拥堵少得多，他们可以稍微加大油门，速度相当快。当他们经过慕尼黑、因戈尔施塔特、纽伦堡等地时，明日香开始指出沿途的景点。到处都是城镇，大城镇周围分布着许多小城镇。形态各异的田野、森林、河流，这是一个美丽的国家。在旅途中的一天，他们在柏林郊区离开了高速公路，绕过城市的南面和东面。NERV 的柏林分部位于城市东侧约 20 公里处。一条宽阔的高速公路直接通往设施，与东京-3 的 NERV 一样，该设施也建在地下。

It was passing into night when they came upon the signs warning of the guard posts ahead. "What do they say?" Shinji asked. They had been quiet for a long time looking down the road in the growing dark.  
当他们看到前方警戒哨的警告标志时，夜幕正悄然降临。“上面说什么？”真嗣问道。他们已经沉默了很久，在渐浓的黑暗中凝视着前方的道路。

Asuka pointed to one, "Please have identification ready" then at another "Visitors center next right - Open 0900-1600". She dismounted from her motorcycle and doffed her helmet, holding it under her arm. "I think I want to stay out here tonight. I don't see any lights ahead, and don't feel like fumbling around in the dark right now."  
明日香指向一处，“请准备好身份证明”，然后又指向另一处，“访客中心在下一个右转处——开放时间 0900-1600”。她从摩托车上下来，摘下头盔，夹在腋下。“我想今晚就待在外面。前面看不到灯光，现在也不想在黑暗中摸索。”

"Agreed." "同意。"

---

The fire kept the cool night air at bay. Its long orange tongues licked at the sky, providing dancing shadows all over the ground around it. Asuka and Shinji ate and retired early that night, but there was none of their usual bed play. Asuka was a bit more somber over the last day, and Shinji felt that there was a weight on her chest that she was wrestling with.  
篝火驱散了凉爽的夜风。它那长长的橙色火舌舔舐着天空，在地上投下跳跃的影子。那晚，明日香和真嗣早早吃完饭就休息了，但没有了往常的床笫之欢。明日香在最近一天里显得有些沉闷，真嗣感觉到她胸中有一份沉重，正与之搏斗。

The next morning, after an abbreviated breakfast, Shinji and Asuka rode the motorcycles the final few hundred meters to the main gates. One of them was lifted a few feet from the pavement providing at least enough room for a person to enter. The bikes would have to stay outside for now. Shinji got their flashlights out and clicked each one on before they ducked under the gate door. Inside was inky blackness that seemed to go on forever. They walked cautiously down the paved tunnel making good speed. There were no vehicles at all, and the lanes were unobstructed.  
次日清晨，简短的早餐后，真嗣和明日香骑着摩托车，最后几百米驶向了主大门。其中一扇门被抬离地面几英尺，至少足够一个人进入。摩托车暂时只能留在外面。真嗣取出他们的手电筒，打开每个开关，然后他们弯腰钻过门。里面是漆黑一片，仿佛永无尽头。他们小心翼翼地沿着铺好的隧道快速前进。隧道内没有任何车辆，车道畅通无阻。

They had gone perhaps 200 meters when quite suddenly the whole tunnel was flooded with light as every fixture inside switched on with an audible _chunk_ sound. Shielding their eyes, Shinji and Asuka backed to the guardrailed sidewalk that lined the road, expecting some greeting party, possibly with guns drawn, but there was no one. They were alone.  
他们大约走了 200 米，突然间整个隧道被灯光淹没，所有灯具随着一声清晰的咔嗒声同时亮起。真嗣和明日香遮住眼睛，退到沿路的有护栏的人行道上，以为会有迎接队伍，可能还拿着枪，但空无一人。他们独自在此。

Deep beneath them, the power was indeed on. The low hum of cooling fans and air exchanges droned on in the darkness. The three massive computers had sat mostly dormant for the past months sipping power from the draining reserves. Earlier that day, sensors had picked up the two sleeping humans nearing the facility, and the long powerup sequence initiated. The MAGI computed it's survival rate at about 75% so long as the two did not take too long making their way to the control room.  
在他们脚下深处，电力确实已启动。冷却风扇和空气交换的低沉嗡鸣在黑暗中持续不断。这三台庞大的计算机在过去几个月里大部分时间都处于休眠状态，仅从逐渐枯竭的储备中汲取电力。就在那天早些时候，传感器检测到两名沉睡的人类正接近设施，于是漫长的启动序列被启动了。MAGI 计算出，只要这两个人不花太长时间到达控制室，其生存率约为 75%。

Power was not dangerously low right now, but by the time the startup sequence was complete, they would be at 10% of the reserve. There would not be enough power to start up again, and thus they could not risk powering down again.  
目前电力并不处于危险低值，但等到启动序列完成时，他们将只剩下 10%的储备。没有足够的电力再次启动，因此他们不能冒险再次断电。

"Was it motion activated?" Asuka said after a moment.  
“它是运动激活的吗？”过了一会儿，明日香说道。

"I don't see why anyone would build the tunnel like that. They usually light then 24 hours a day don't they?" Shinji looked around nervously, and stepped away from the guardrail. The tunnel curved downward and was lost on the far side of the curve, but it went for some considerable distance. It would take them a while to cover that much ground. "If the power is on, maybe we can open the doors and get the bikes. It will at least make it easier to get down into the facility."  
"我不明白为什么有人会把隧道建造成这样。它们通常是 24 小时照明的，不是吗？" 真嗣紧张地环顾四周，并远离了护栏。隧道向下弯曲，在远处的拐角处消失，但它延伸了相当长的距离。要走完这段路程需要一些时间。"如果电源开着，也许我们可以打开门取出自行车。至少这样下到设施里会容易些。"

Asuka agreed and after revisiting the guard post outside the gate, they found a control that did in fact have power now. They raised the gate with a loud screech of unlubricated metal, then remounted the bikes and ventured into the tunnel once again.  
明日香同意了，他们重新检查了大门外的岗亭，果然找到了一个现在有电的控制器。他们用刺耳的未润滑金属声升起了大门，然后重新骑上自行车，再次进入隧道。

They passed a number of turn-offs and side tunnels complete with intersections and street lights, but these were all dark, the side tunnels un-illuminated. They passed a particularly large side tunnel and for the first time felt wind blowing from one side to the other. Something was pushing that air, so it was not just lights on down here.  
他们经过了许多岔道和侧隧道，这些隧道都配有交叉口和路灯，但这些都处于黑暗中，侧隧道未被照亮。他们经过一个特别大的侧隧道时，第一次感受到了从一边吹向另一边的风。有什么东西在推动这些空气，所以这里不仅仅是灯光的问题。

"Environmental controls must be working still." Asuka said as they slowed down for one of the occasional security checkpoints. "Or maybe they are working again. Maybe they started up again or something."  
“环境控制系统应该还在运作。”明日香说道，他们为了通过偶尔的安全检查站而减速。“或者可能又恢复工作了。也许它们重新启动了之类的。”

Not far beyond the checkpoint was a large vehicle parking structure. Cars and other vehicles would arrive on a platform, the occupants would exit, then it would then be whisked away and inserted into a slot in the structure. Instead of doing this, they drove their bikes over to an area that had been marked off with diagonal yellow lines and parked.  
不远处过了检查站，有一座大型车辆停车楼。汽车和其他车辆会到达一个平台，乘客下车后，车辆便会被迅速移走并插入停车楼的某个位置。他们没有这样做，而是骑着自行车来到一个用斜黄线标记的区域，停了下来。

Nearby there were three levels of doors that entered the facility, one below, on on their level, and one above. The lights were on in the bottom level, but the top two were dark.  
附近有三层门通往设施，一层在下方，一层在他们所在的高度，还有一层在上方。最底层亮着灯，但上面两层都是暗的。

"We need to go down." Asuka stated. "Most of the command element and offices are down there, and if we want to see what's what, that is where it will be. The middle level goes to the engineering and science labs, and I think the upper level goes to storage and medical and other stuff." She took Shinji's hand and they walked down the glass stairs that led to the lowest level of entrances. "Stay close, Shinji. This place is not laid out like Headquarters in Tokyo-3 was. It is huge and it is easy to get lost."  
"“我们需要下去。”明日香说道，“大部分指挥部门和办公室都在下面，要想了解情况，那里是关键。中间层通往工程和科学实验室，我想上层则是储存和医疗等其他设施。”她牵起真嗣的手，两人沿着通往最低层入口的玻璃楼梯走去。“跟紧我，真嗣。这里不像东京-3 的总部那样布局，地方很大，很容易迷路。”

A young computer scientist named Richter had implemented this failsafe some months before the Impact event in Tokyo-3. Figuring that the events looming on the horizon would wipe humanity out completely, it was a last bid to pass on the legacy of humanity to any intelligence that came after. During the powered down state, the MAGI computers housed at each of the NERV installations around the world could lay dormant for centuries. But once the automated sensory equipment picked up intelligent life, there was an unfortunately short window where the main power had to be restarted or the reserve batteries powering the computers would empty, and they would die.  
一位名叫里希特的年轻计算机科学家在第三次冲击事件前几个月设置了这一安全措施。考虑到即将到来的灾难可能会彻底毁灭人类，这是将人类遗产传递给后世智慧生命的最后努力。在断电状态下，分布在全球各地 NERV 设施中的 MAGI 计算机可以休眠数百年。但一旦自动感应设备检测到智能生命，就有一个不幸的短暂窗口期，必须重启主电源，否则为计算机供电的备用电池耗尽，它们就会失效。

The computer contemplated possible actions to lead the two to the control room more quickly. In its current state it could not lock doors, but it could turn on lights. Perhaps by only illuminating a route to the control room it could steer them here. The self preservation in the computer made the arrival of the two humans of paramount importance. It quickly calculated the shortest and easiest route from the above-ground main entrance to the primary control center. The two humans were slowly walking down Tunnel 3 in the dark.  
计算机思索着引导两人更快抵达控制室的可能行动。在当前状态下，它无法锁门，但能开启灯光。或许仅照亮通往控制室的路径，便能引导他们前来。计算机中的自我保护机制使得这两个人类的到来变得至关重要。它迅速计算出从地面主入口到主控中心的最短且最便捷的路径。那两人正缓慢地在黑暗中的三号隧道下行走。

When the lights were activated, the two humans left and came back with their vehicles. They followed the tunnel directly to the main entrance array, and stepped inside. If the computer had been capable of sighing in relief it would have. Instead it powered down the lights in the tunnel except the ones just outside the entrance to save battery power. It has illuminated the route all the way here, but for some reason they pair were going somewhere else. For a few milliseconds the computer contemplated what it would have been capable of if the R&D department had finished its work on the teleport technology. Then it spent a few more chiding itself for wasting time on something that did not come anywhere close to fruition.  
当灯光被激活时，两个人类离开了，然后带着他们的车辆回来。他们直接沿着隧道前往主入口阵列，并走了进去。如果计算机有能力松一口气的话，它会的。相反，它关闭了隧道中除入口附近以外的所有灯光以节省电池电量。它一直照亮着通往这里的路线，但出于某种原因，这对搭档要去别的地方。在几毫秒的时间里，计算机思考着如果研发部门完成了传送技术的研发，它能做些什么。然后，它又花了一些时间责备自己浪费时间在一件远未实现的事情上。

Shinji and Asuka were heading down into the darkness. "Where are we going?"  
真嗣和明日香正朝着黑暗深处走去。“我们要去哪儿？”

"I am pretty sure my father had an office down here. It is the first place I wanted to go when we got here." Her face was a mask of grim determination. "I havent actually spoken to him in a long time, and I would be interested to see what he had to say about me. Surely he knew about Seele attacking Tokyo-3, so he must have known that I would be in harms way."  
“我很确定我父亲在这里有个办公室。这是我们到达这里后我第一个想去的地方。”她的脸上带着坚定的决心。“我已经很久没有和他说过话了，我很想知道他会怎么评价我。他肯定知道 Seele 攻击了东京-3，所以他一定知道我会处于危险之中。”

Shinji mentally prepared himself for disaster. He did not expect this to end well. It seemed like people involved with NERV had parental issues. Unless her father decided that she was important after all before the end, she may not find anything about her there.  
真嗣在心里为即将到来的灾难做好了准备。他并不指望这件事会有好结果。似乎与 NERV 有关的人都有亲子问题。除非她的父亲在一切结束前终于意识到她的重要性，否则她在那里可能找不到任何关于自己的东西。

They neared a crossing hallway that lit up as they came to it. Asuka stopped abruptly, and looked down the length of the lit hallway. She stepped forward as if to continue, but just as her foot hit the floor there was a loud buzzing sound played over the keypads of the nearby doors almost like she has answered a question incorrectly.  
他们走近一个交叉的走廊，随着他们的到来，走廊亮了起来。明日香突然停下，沿着被照亮的走廊望去。她向前迈步似乎要继续前行，但就在她的脚触地的那一刻，附近门上的键盘突然响起了一阵刺耳的蜂鸣声，仿佛她答错了问题。

Warily she stepped in the direction of the lit hallway and no buzzing sound effect followed. Then she stepped to the darkened hallway and once again the buzz only this time it was louder.  
她小心翼翼地朝着亮起的走廊走去，没有蜂鸣声跟随。然后她走向黑暗的走廊，蜂鸣声再次响起，只是这次更响了。

"Do you think someone is here?" Shinji asked. His heart was beating heavily in his chest, and he could hear the rush of blood in his ears. The thought that they were being watched (or guided) was unnerving.  
"你觉得有人在这里吗？" 真嗣问道。他的心脏在胸腔中剧烈跳动，耳边能听到血液奔涌的声音。想到他们可能正被人监视（或引导），这让他感到不安。

"I think someone is here, and I think they want us to go somewhere." she replied. Then a little louder, "And why they cant seem to communicate to us directly is beyond me." This last was met with silence. Surely anyone watching would also be able to hit the intercom button right? "Lets go this way and see what's what." She indicated the lit hallway.  
"我觉得有人在这里，而且他们想让我们去某个地方。" 她回答道。然后稍微提高声音，"他们为什么不能直接与我们沟通，这让我无法理解。" 这番话之后是一片沉默。任何监视者应该也能按下对讲按钮吧？"我们走这边看看情况。" 她指向那条亮着灯的走廊。

They walked for a few minutes turning corners and turning onto other lit hallways when the lighting turned instead of continuing on. This was surreal. Some force was at work, and it did not want to communicate with them until they got where they were going. Shinji felt sure that this was the case.  
他们走了几分钟，转弯进入其他亮着灯的走廊，每当灯光变换时，他们就随之改变方向。这一切显得如此超现实。某种力量在起作用，它不打算在他们到达目的地之前与他们沟通。真嗣确信这一点。

"I think he or she is leading us to the command center. I walked this way a hundred times from my fathers office. We are almost there." Sure enough, up ahead a pressure door opened onto an expansive room, not unlike Central Dogma. This was not a battle command post though. It looked more like a newsroom or an operations crisis room. There were monitors everywhere, desks and workstation littered with paperwork and more than a few dark spots on the metal floor that marked the position of a person at the time of Third Impact. Shinji wondered briefly if Asuka's father had been here.  
“我想他或她在带我们去指挥中心。我从父亲的办公室走过这条路不下百次。我们快到了。”果然，前方一扇压力门打开，通向一个宽敞的房间，与中央 dogma 颇为相似。但这并非战斗指挥所，看起来更像新闻编辑室或危机操作室。到处都是显示器，桌子和工作站上散落着文件，金属地板上有不少深色斑点，标记着第三次冲击发生时人们所在的位置。真嗣不禁好奇，明日香的爸爸是否也曾在这里。

A display caught their attention on the forward monitor. It was a power readout. It had fallen to 8.75% and was dropping a hundredth of a percent ever few seconds. A diagram of a battery had the 5% mark labeled in blue. "What does that say?" Shinji pointed to the label next to the 5% mark.  
前方显示器上的一个图表吸引了他们的注意。这是一个能量读数，已降至 8.75%，并且每几秒下降 0.01%。电池图示上，5% 的标记用蓝色标出。“那是什么意思？”真嗣指向 5% 标记旁的标签。

"It says 'Magdeburg Hydroelectric Reservoir Penstock Minimum Power'." Asuka furrowed her eyebrows. Two lines of text appeared on the screen, one in German, the other in Japanese. "Minimum power to open Penstock valves at Magdeburg Hydroelectric Reservoir. Battery power will fall below minimum in 12 minutes, 47 seconds." Then a diagram showing a switch and a stick figure moving it from Standby to Active.  
"上面写着‘马格德堡水电站闸门最低功率’。" 明日香皱起眉头。屏幕上出现了两行文字，一行是德语，另一行是日语。"马格德堡水电站闸门开启最低功率。电池电量将在 12 分钟 47 秒后低于最低值。" 接着是一个显示开关和一个小人将其从待机状态切换到活动状态的图示。

Shinji looked around and saw the switch. I was a large flat orange metal tab that fit into a slot of the same shape. Above and below it were instructions which Asuka read aloud, "Activate only in the event of an emergency loss of power. 5% of Battery Array power is required to open Penstocks. Allow 3 minutes for Generators to spin up to full operating speed."  
真嗣环顾四周，看到了那个开关。它是一个扁平的橙色金属片，形状与插槽相匹配。开关上下都有指示，明日香大声读了出来："仅在紧急断电情况下激活。开启闸门需要电池组 5%的电量。发电机需 3 分钟才能加速至全速运转。"

"So, the computer, I guess the MAGI, are running on batteries and are unable to power up the hydro-electric system themselves." Asuka reached out and pulled on the lever but it did not move. She pulled harder and found that there was a little give, but it still did not move from the slot it was in. Shinji got his fingers behind it and added is weight. Slowly together, they worked it out of the slot, then bracing against the wall, managed to flip it down into a matching slot on the bottom. The clock on the monitor still counted down, but now the 5% mark was green.  
“所以，电脑，我猜是 MAGI 系统，现在靠电池运行，无法自行启动水力发电系统。”明日香伸出手去拉操纵杆，但它纹丝不动。她用力拉了拉，发现有些松动，但仍卡在槽中。真嗣用手指顶住，加上自己的体重，两人慢慢合力将其从槽中拉出，然后抵着墙壁，设法将其翻转到下方的匹配槽中。监视器上的时钟仍在倒计时，但现在 5%的标记变成了绿色。

A whirring sound of motors filled the room and the stale somewhat warm air was replaced by cooler freshly filtered air. After a moment the main monitor changed to a display of the status of the three MAGI supercomputers and the battery display shrank and began refilling. A stream of text scrolled by much faster than either of them could read it. Maps of the area, satellite images, schematics of the base all flashed on the screen as the MAGI were getting their bearings. Finally the monitor blanked and then a man was there talking.  
电机运转的嗡嗡声充斥着房间，陈旧而略带温热的空气被更凉爽、经过新鲜过滤的空气所取代。片刻后，主监视器切换到显示三个 MAGI 超级计算机的状态，电池显示缩小并开始重新充电。一行行文字以他们无法阅读的速度滚动而过。区域地图、卫星图像、基地图纸，所有这些都在屏幕上闪现，MAGI 系统正在定位自身。最终，监视器空白了一瞬，随后出现了一个正在说话的男人。

December 12th, 2014, it is 1637 Zulu. My name is Johann Richter, I am a junior member of the computer science research staff at NERV-Berlin. If someone is watching this then my work has paid off at least to this point, and the worst has come to pass for the rest of us. Over the last few months I have become privy to some very disturbing information about the organization for which I work.  
2014 年 12 月 12 日，1637 时，世界协调时间。我叫约翰·里希特，是 NERV 柏林分部计算机科学研究团队的一名初级成员。如果有人能看到这段视频，那么我的努力至少在此刻得到了回报，而我们其他人则可能已经遭遇了最坏的情况。过去几个月里，我接触到了一些关于我所在组织的极其令人不安的信息。

It is my belief and understanding that the unstated purpose of this organization is to change the nature of consciousness for the human race and thus shedding us of our physical bodies. While this may sound good to some people, it is not for anyone else to decide that for anyone else. I have made plans with an operative who is working in the Tokyo base to try and thwart this plan, but in the event that we fail, I felt that it would be best to to have a backup.  
据我了解和相信，这个组织未公开的目的是改变人类意识的本质，从而使我们摆脱肉体束缚。尽管这对某些人来说可能是件好事，但任何人都不应该替他人做出这样的决定。我与东京基地的一名特工制定了计划，试图阻止这一计划，但如果我们失败了，我认为最好有一个备份方案。

I don't know who you are, or even if you can understand me. I have to assume that you are not human as the plan calls for the entirety of the human race on Earth to be part of this...process.  
我不知道你是谁，甚至不知道你是否能理解我。我必须假设你不是人类，因为该计划要求地球上整个人类种族都参与这个...过程。

You will find in the computers before you as much of the sum of human knowledge as could be collected in the time I have had left. I am working under the assumption that you have encountered this place after some time has passed. There are books, music, stories, works of art, and most importantly historical records of our race.  
你将在面前的电脑中找到尽可能多的人类知识总和，这些是在我剩余时间内所能收集的。我假设你们是在一段时间后才来到这个地方。这里有书籍、音乐、故事、艺术作品，最重要的是我们种族的历史记录。

Lastly, I have taken the liberty of preserving 35 adult humans in the medical wing cryogenic lab. They consist of 16 males, 19 females from nearly every ethnic group we could get on short notice. They are volunteers, although in the interest of secrecy for the general public we could not let them in on the whole of the situation.  
最后，我自作主张在医疗翼的低温实验室中保存了 35 名成年人类。他们包括 16 名男性和 19 名女性，几乎涵盖了我们能在短时间内找到的每一个种族。他们是志愿者，尽管为了公众的保密，我们不能让他们完全了解整个情况。

You now hold in your hand the future of our species. We have evolved from more rudimentary lifeforms to our present species over a period of hundreds of millions of years. The preservation of our species is one of the strongest driving forces that we have. Please allow us the opportunity to do that. Allow us to preserve at least a portion of who we are.  
你现在手中握着我们物种的未来。我们从更原始的生命形式进化到现在的物种，经历了数亿年的时间。保护我们的物种是我们最强大的驱动力之一。请给我们这个机会，让我们至少保存一部分我们的身份。

The transmission ended, and Shinji and Asuka sat dumbfounded. It was a lot to process. Someone had foreseen the end, and in secrecy had prepared a time capsule of sorts that they hoped would be found and opened to allow the human race to continue? The silence, save for the airflow and fans, settled for a minute or more.  
传输结束，真嗣和明日香呆若木鸡。这信息量太大了。有人预见到了末日，并在秘密中准备了一个类似时间胶囊的东西，希望它能被发现并打开，以便人类得以延续？除了气流和风扇的声音，沉默持续了一分钟甚至更久。

"What are we going to do?" Shinji looked at Asuka as he said this. "What are we going to do about this?"  
“我们该怎么办？”真嗣看着明日香说道，“我们该怎么处理这件事？”

"We have to let them out, of course." Asuka looked incredulously back at him.  
“当然得把他们放出来。”明日香难以置信地回望着他。

Shinji worried that this might be the catalyst that returned them to the divided, conniving, and ultimately self destructive people they had been. On the other hand, there was little hope for the continuance for the race as it was. He had come to terms with the idea of having children, and had in fact vowed to himself that he would absolutely never treat any child of his like his father had. Any child that they had would be doomed to be the last of the human race or be forced to inbreed to save it for what, one generation, two?  
真嗣担心这可能成为催化剂，让他们重新变回分裂、狡诈、最终自我毁灭的族群。另一方面，种族以目前的状态延续下去的希望渺茫。他已接受生育后代的想法，并暗自发誓绝不会像他父亲那样对待自己的孩子。他们若有孩子，注定要么成为人类种族的末裔，要么被迫近亲繁殖以挽救种族，但又能维持几代呢？

"I guess so. Asuka, just so you know, I am not completely OK with that. How can we instill in these people the long lasting impression that we can't return to the old ways, or we will end up in this same situation again?"  
“我想是的。明日香，只是让你知道，我对此并不完全接受。我们如何才能让这些人深刻铭记，我们不能重蹈覆辙，否则将再次陷入同样的境地？”

Asuka thought about that for a moment. "I think, after they see their loved ones as little pools of dried liquid, and the world devoid of other human life, the point will be driven home quite well, don't you?"  
明日香沉思片刻。“我想，当他们看到所爱之人化作一滩干涸的液体，世界空无他人时，这个教训会深深烙印在他们心中，你不觉得吗？”

---

They actually took their time going to the cryo lab. The power coming from the hydro electric dam in Magdeburg would power the base indefinitely (assuming it was kept up). The MAGI reported that the more or less automated procedure for thawing the specimens would require at least two weeks to complete, and there was not a definite need to start the process right now.  
他们实际上是慢悠悠地前往低温实验室的。来自马格德堡水电站的电力将无限期地为基地供电（假设维护得当）。MAGI 报告称，解冻样本的近乎自动化的程序至少需要两周时间才能完成，目前并没有迫切需要立即启动这一过程。

Interestingly the MAGI computer recognized them as employees of NERV with some of the highest clearance, despite the fact that they should have been listed as enemies or something due to their connection with the Tokyo-3 branch. Regardless they made their way back to the corridor where they had been redirected earlier. Not far from where they left off was a door marked for a Dr. Langley.  
有趣的是，MAGI 计算机将他们识别为 NERV 的高级权限员工，尽管由于他们与第三新东京支部的关联，理应被列为敌对分子之类。尽管如此，他们还是回到了之前被指引的走廊。不远处，他们离开的地方有一扇门上标着“兰格利博士”。

"Are you sure you want to go in there? Does it matter what he thought? You've told me on a few occasions that he was always distant and absorbed in his work." Shinji put his hands on Asuka's shoulders, turning her to face him. "If he thought of you in the end and regretted the way he acted toward you, it is going to make you feel guilty for hating him."  
“你确定要进去吗？他的想法真的重要吗？你曾几次告诉我，他总是疏远且沉浸于工作。”真嗣将双手放在明日香的肩上，让她面对自己。“如果他在最后时刻想到了你，并后悔自己对你的态度，那会让你因为恨他而感到内疚。”

"I don't-" Shinji put his finger to her lips and continued.  
"我不——" 真嗣将手指放在她的唇上，继续说道。

"If he was still focused on his work, and did not feel anything toward you or the danger you might be in, it will only make you more angry." He pursed his lips and regarded her for a few seconds. "Why not just let him be as you remember and not re-open wounds that are finally starting to heal, hmm?"  
"如果他仍然专注于工作，对你或你可能面临的危险毫无感觉，只会让你更加愤怒。" 他抿了抿嘴唇，注视了她几秒钟。"为什么不让他保持你记忆中的样子，不再揭开那些终于开始愈合的伤口呢，嗯？"

Asuka leaned back on the wall opposite the door, and stared at it for a moment. She had wanted to come here to see her home (which was actually back in Berlin), that was true, but she had also wanted to see her father. She wanted to see how he had turned out in the end. Reluctantly, she looked back to Shinji. "I guess so. I've been angry at him for so long that I just want to either be finally vindicated or proven wrong, one of the two. I am sure it is not the best way to deal with something like that, but I suppose you're right, Shinji. Let him be. He's gone and regardless of how he ended up, he is not coming back and he won't be changed."  
明日香靠在门对面的墙上，凝视了一会儿。她确实想回到这里看看她的家（实际上是在柏林），但她也想见见她的父亲。她想看看他最终变成了什么样子。不情愿地，她回头看向真嗣。"我想是的。我对他生气了这么久，我只是想最终得到证实或证明我是错的，两者之一。我知道这不是处理这种事情的最佳方式，但我想你是对的，真嗣。让他去吧。他已经走了，无论他最终如何，他都不会回来，也不会改变。"

She took a deep breath, exhaled, then took another. She wouldn't visit her father. He would remain the unseen, and mostly unknown figure who did not raise her, and replaced her mother.  
她深吸一口气，缓缓呼出，接着又吸了一口。她不会去见她的父亲。他将始终是一个未曾露面、多半不为人知的角色，未曾抚养她，也取代了她的母亲。

---

The cryogenic lab was a pristine area of glass and stainless steel and white plastic. Shinji and Asuka had actually expected the "specimens" to be in glass tubes or something. In fact, they were not. A balcony looked over a large slab of some black solid. Hydraulic arms attached to the top indicated that it could be raised. The computer covered the basics of the cryo array with another message from Richter.  
低温实验室是一片由玻璃、不锈钢和白色塑料构成的洁净区域。真嗣和明日香原本以为“样本”会被存放在玻璃管之类的东西里。实际上，并非如此。一个阳台俯瞰着一大块黑色的固体。连接在上方的液压臂表明它可以被升起。电脑屏幕上，里希特的信息简要介绍了低温阵列的基本情况。

"This cryogenic facility was initially intended to contain key members of the upper echelon in the even that their plans would require more time than they had. Once the technology had been fully developed and tested, the facility was mothballed until needed. I have repurposed it.  
这座低温设施最初设计用于在计划所需时间超出预期时，保存高层核心成员。一旦技术完全开发并经过测试，该设施便被封存，直至需要时启用。我已将其重新利用。

"The volunteer members are each frozen in a special slow solidifying gel. They are placed into standing recipticles in the array to your left, the gel is pumped in, the lid is closed and the process begins. Both the freezing and thawing processes actually take quite a bit of time because the body has a difficult time adjusting to the changes we are putting it through. A number of drugs are also administered to keep crystal formation to an absolute minimum and to keep the various systems of the body from going into arrest as the temperature drops.  
志愿者成员们各自被固定在一种特殊的缓慢固化凝胶中。他们被安置在左侧阵列的站立式容器内，凝胶被注入，盖子关闭，流程随即开始。无论是冷冻还是解冻过程，实际上都需要相当长的时间，因为身体很难适应我们所施加的变化。还会施用多种药物，以将晶体形成降至最低，并防止身体各系统在温度下降时发生衰竭。

"Detailed instructions are provided for that last stages of the process including removal and post-thaw treatment of the volunteers."  
详细的操作指南涵盖了流程的最后阶段，包括志愿者的移除和解冻后的处理。

They left the facility late in the afternoon. After watching the video from Dr Richter a couple of times, they once again mulled over the problem of releasing these people. It was a tough decision even when you had convinced yourself that it was the right one because it was something that could not be undone once started. Doing so would kill them. In the end, they did it together. A series of commands on the computer overlooking the slab was all it took.  
他们在傍晚时分离开了设施。在多次观看里希特博士的视频后，他们再次深思如何释放这些人。即便你已说服自己这是正确的决定，这也是一个艰难的选择，因为一旦开始就无法逆转。这样做会夺走他们的生命。最终，他们共同做出了决定。只需在监控台的电脑上输入一系列指令，一切便开始了。

They also visited the storage rooms on their way out. There was some food left there, mostly dry stuff. Most everything in the freezer had gone over, and nothing in refrigerated storage was good anymore. They did find a wealth of other things though. Electric vehicles in the motor pool, electronics and computer equipment, cold and hot weather equipment in uniform storage, weapons and ammunition. These latter may need to be blocked off or something. They did not know the people they were releasing and further didn't know how they would react to the revelation that the human race on Earth now consisted of 17 men, and 20 women.  
他们离开时还参观了储藏室。那里还剩下一些食物，大多是干货。冷冻室里的东西大多已经变质，冷藏储存的物品也不再新鲜。不过，他们确实找到了许多其他东西。机动车库里的电动车，电子和计算机设备，制服储存室里的冷热装备，武器和弹药。这些可能需要封锁或采取其他措施。他们不知道自己释放的人是谁，更不知道这些人得知地球上现存人类只有 17 名男性和 20 名女性时会有何反应。

Dinner was eaten unenthusiastically, and they went to bed soon after. Fortunately, they had found a way to comfort each other and that helped to put the anxiety of the day behind them. Shinji lay awake next to Asuka, the sweat drying in the cool night air. What would the new world they were creating here be. Would they be a race of humans hell bent on conquering one another, or conversely could they unite in some fashion and be better than their forebears? Asuka rolled over to face him and wrapped one leg over his and they fell asleep that way.  
晚餐吃得并不热情，不久后他们就上床睡觉了。幸运的是，他们找到了彼此安慰的方法，这有助于将一天的焦虑抛诸脑后。真嗣躺在明日香旁边，汗水在凉爽的夜风中逐渐干涸。他们正在创造的新世界会是什么样子？人类会是一心征服彼此的种族，还是能够以某种方式团结起来，超越他们的祖先？明日香翻身面对他，一条腿搭在他身上，他们就这样睡着了。

### Chapter 17 I'm Sorry

After two days of hanging around the NERV complex, and essentially being told that there was nothing to be done by the computers, Shinji and Asuka decided it was time to go see the area. Asuka intended to stop by her former home later, but first, she wanted to check out the lay of the land and look around.  
在 NERV 总部徘徊了两天，基本上被告知电脑系统无计可施后，真嗣和明日香决定是时候去探索一下周边地区了。明日香打算稍后顺道拜访她曾经的家，但首先，她想熟悉一下地形并四处看看。

The day was bright and the sky was dotted with clouds. Shinji swore that the air was clear enough to see 200 miles if the land permitted. Without the damaging effects of the humans, the quality of the environment was rapidly improving. They had both spoken at length that they hoped the future would be cleaner than the past. They certainly had the chance to make it come to pass. Also, it likely would be many generations before there were people in numbers enough to pose a threat to the global environment.  
那天阳光明媚，天空点缀着朵朵白云。真嗣发誓，空气清澈到若非地形限制，能望见两百英里之外。没有了人类的破坏，环境质量正迅速改善。他们曾多次谈到，希望未来比过去更清洁。他们确实有机会实现这一愿景。而且，可能要经过许多代人，才会有足够数量的人口对全球环境构成威胁。

They rode their motor cycles along the empty city streets. There was almost no traffic, and no apparent damage to the city by fire or other catastrophe. The silence would have been deafening had they not gotten used to the lack of people. A few parks had run-to-riot fields, and lawns were unkempt and over grown. A couple of trees on one thoroughfare had fallen, possibly due to high wind at one point or another, and one had crushed the roof of a car parked nearby.  
他们骑着摩托车穿梭在空无一人的城市街道上。几乎没有车辆，城市也未见火灾或其他灾难造成的明显破坏。若非习惯了人迹罕至，这寂静几乎震耳欲聋。几处公园的草地野蛮生长，草坪杂乱无章，茂盛异常。一条大街上有几棵树倒下了，或许是某次强风所致，其中一棵压扁了附近停放的一辆车的车顶。

They climbed the stairs of a tall building, perhaps 40 floors, so that they might get a bird's eye view of the city. Shinji marveled at how flat everything was. "Where is Magdeburg? Seems like it would be close right? How did they build a dam there if it is so flat in this area?"  
他们爬上了一座高楼的楼梯，大约有四十层，只为了一览城市的全貌。真嗣惊叹于一切的平坦。“马格德堡在哪里？看起来应该很近吧？如果这一带这么平坦，他们是怎么在那里建起水坝的呢？”

"It's an amazing bit of engineering, really. It isn't really a dam but a canal bridge. See, they built a canal that would allow faster travel to specific places where the river Elbe didn't go. They had to build a bridge over the river since it turned upstream."  
“这真是一项了不起的工程，实际上。那并不是真正的大坝，而是一座运河桥。你看，他们建造了一条运河，以便更快地通往易北河未曾流经的特定地点。由于河流转向上游，他们不得不在河上建了一座桥。”

"And then they use the water in the canal to generate power?" Shinji asked almost incredulously.  
“然后他们利用运河中的水来发电？”真嗣几乎难以置信地问道。

"Well, that's a relatively recent thing. It only supplements the power generation of the region. It is not a large power source, and the canal isn't used much anymore or it wasn't when I was here. There was some kind of recession or something local to Magdeburg a while back and shipping there dried up. So they closed the canal to traffic and repurposed it for power generation."  
“嗯，这是相对较近的事情。它只是补充了该地区的电力生产。并不是一个大型电源，而且运河也不怎么使用了，至少我在这里的时候是这样。马格德堡那边曾经有过某种经济衰退，当地的航运业就枯竭了。所以他们关闭了运河的交通，将其改造成了发电用途。”

They looked out over the city again. Shinji now noticed that there were at least two small areas destroyed by fires. Berlin had not gone untouched by the event. After 15 minutes they'd had enough, and quietly left the building the way they had come. Outside at ground level birds were singing and the wind was blowing. There was no car exhaust, no horns, no construction sound. If you closed your eyes, you might even think you were in the country.  
他们再次眺望城市。真嗣现在注意到至少有两处小区域被火灾摧毁。柏林并未在这场事件中幸免。15 分钟后，他们已经看够了，便悄无声息地按照原路离开了大楼。在地面上，鸟儿在歌唱，风在吹拂。没有汽车尾气，没有喇叭声，没有建筑噪音。如果你闭上眼睛，你甚至可能以为自己身处乡村。

"You ready to go see my house? Wanna come back to my place? Hmm?" Asuka smiled at Shnji. He laughed shortly and made an affirmative gesture. They turned their bikes around and Asuka led the way out of the city. Her home had been in a fairly affluent neighborhood. The homes could not rightly be called mansions, but they were by far larger than any homes Shinji had seen in Japan.  
"准备好去看看我家了吗？想回我家吗？嗯？" 明日香对真嗣微笑着。他短促地笑了笑，并做出了肯定的手势。他们调转自行车方向，明日香领路驶离城市。她的家位于一个相当富裕的社区。这些房子虽不能称之为豪宅，但比起真嗣在日本见过的任何住宅都要大得多。

This house had been built to resemble a farm cottage, only much larger than any farmer would have built their house. The lower level was mostly stone with ivy and moss growing on it, while the upper two floors had been constructed in timber frame and plaster style.  
这座房子设计得像一座农舍，只是比任何农夫建的房子都要大得多。底层主要是石头砌成，上面爬满了常春藤和苔藓，而上两层则是采用木框架和灰泥建造的风格。

They got off the bikes and stood looking at the house for a few moments. Asuka grabbed his hand and drug him around to the back of the house. This was far enough out that the lots were large. This home had a large back yard that had probably once had been manicured and beautiful. It could probably be made so again without a whole lot of work. The yard was shaded by several tall trees. There was no evidence of any play equipment or other children's items. Presumably Asuka had lived here for some time, but it appeared that there was very little play that went on back here.  
他们下了自行车，站在那里凝视着房子片刻。明日香抓住他的手，拉着他绕到房子后面。这里已经远离市区，每块地都相当宽敞。这栋房子拥有一个宽阔的后院，或许曾经经过精心打理，美丽非凡。或许只需稍加努力，便能重现昔日风采。院子被几棵高大的树木遮蔽着。没有任何游乐设施或其他儿童用品的痕迹。明日香显然在这里生活了一段时间，但看起来后院很少有玩耍的痕迹。

Turning from the yard, he saw her move a potted plant that was next to the door. Underneath was a key that she quickly used to disengage the deadbolt. She motioned for him to follow, and they went inside, finding the kitchen, then moving on to other parts of the house. She was smiling, and Shinji guessed that despite the lack of play, and possibly a lack of good memories from an abbreviated childhood, this was her home and there would be a sense of belonging and welcome familiarity with this place. There would be places where she would hide to be alone, there would be remnants of play with fantasy friends, and maybe even real ones. There would be little odds and ends of collected mem-  
他转身离开庭院，看到她挪动门旁的一盆植物。下面藏着一把钥匙，她迅速用它打开了门闩。她示意他跟上，两人便进了屋，先是找到了厨房，随后又探索了房子的其他部分。她面带微笑，真嗣猜测，尽管这里可能缺少游戏时光，或许也缺少美好的童年记忆，但这里是她的家，会有一种归属感和熟悉的温馨。她会有独自躲藏的角落，会有与幻想中的朋友玩耍的痕迹，甚至可能还有真实朋友的身影。这里会有她收集的各种小物件，记录着点滴回忆——

"SHINJI!" Asuka's scream for him pulled him from his thoughts. She had continued on to a room further into the house. He ducked into one room, then another looking for her, then he heard her crying and that lead him to her.  
“真嗣！”明日香呼唤他的声音将他从思绪中拉回。她已经继续深入屋内。他先钻进一个房间，又探入另一个，寻找她的身影，直到听见她的哭声，这才找到了她。

The room was an office. It was decorated in some dark wood. Wooden floor, wooden paneled walls, exposed wood beam ceiling. There were bookcases that lined two walls and large windows that dominated the two exterior walls of the room. A very heavy looking desk with rolling chair stood in the middle of the room, a couple of plush receiving chairs were situated in front of it, slightly turned toward the middle.  
房间是一间办公室，以深色木质装饰。木地板，木板墙，裸露的木梁天花板。两面墙被书架覆盖，而另外两面外墙则被大窗户占据。一张看起来非常沉重的办公桌与可滚动的椅子立于房间中央，几把豪华的接待椅摆放在桌前，略微朝向中间。

At the foot of the desk, two bodies, an older man and a woman were sprawled on the floor, badly decomposed. The smell should have been terrible, but Shinji supposed that after all this time there wasn't much left to smell. As it was, it smelled like old paper. He noted that there was a single small hole in each person's head, as well as a small semi-automatic pistol in the man's hand.  
在办公桌脚边，一男一女两具尸体横陈在地，严重腐烂。气味本应极其难闻，但真嗣猜想经过这么长时间，也没剩下多少可闻的了。实际上，它闻起来像旧报纸。他注意到每个人头上都有一个细小的弹孔，以及男子手中握着的一把小型半自动手枪。

He pulled Asuka back out of the doorway that she was leaning on, and pushed her head into the pocket of his shoulder. She was squeezing his arm tightly, but that mattered little to him. He could still look into the office, and he saw now that written in small letters over the walls and floor and desk were "I'M SORRY I'M SORRY I'M SORRY ASUKA I'M SORRY I'M SORRY I'M SORRY I'M SORRY I'M SORRY". Shinji felt goose-bumps spring up on his arms, and the hackles on his neck try to rise.  
他将靠在门上的明日香拉了回来，把她的头按进自己肩膀的口袋里。她紧紧地抓着他的手臂，但这对他来说无关紧要。他仍然可以望向办公室，现在他看到墙上、地板上和桌子上都用小字写着“对不起对不起对不起明日香对不起对不起对不起对不起对不起”。真嗣感到手臂上起了鸡皮疙瘩，脖子上的毛发也试图竖起来。

Dr. Langley lay next to his wife with the gun still in his hand. Shinji didn't know if he killed her first, or if he wrote his insane apology to Asuka, first. Either was horrific. The fact that there were bodies made him think that they had been dead for more than just minutes or hours before Third Impact.  
兰利博士躺在妻子旁边，枪还在他手中。真嗣不知道是他先杀了她，还是先写下了对明日香那疯狂的道歉。无论哪种情况都令人毛骨悚然。有尸体的事实让他认为，他们在第三次冲击之前已经死了不止几分钟或几小时。

He could almost see it in his mind. Langley, a brilliant scientist, finds out through one fashion or another than the organization that he, and his daughter, work for is launching a full scale assault on one of its own branches with the intention of eliminating it, his daughter included. The much more real likelihood that she would die in this case, and the fact that he had devoted so much of his time and resources to the organization that would do this helps push his already overworked mind into madness. He goes home, grief stricken, calls his wife down into his study. Maybe he tells her what he has learned. Maybe he shoots her out of hand. Maybe he takes the time to write 'I'M SORRY' a few hundred times before he calls her. It all ends the same, regardless. They lie dead on the floor in a growing pool of blood. NERV doesn't even send anyone to investigate why he doesn't show up at work, presuming this was days before the event.  
他几乎能在脑海中清晰地描绘出这一幕。兰利，一位才华横溢的科学家，通过某种方式得知，他与女儿所效力的组织正对自身的一个分支发起全面攻击，意图彻底铲除，连他的女儿也在清除之列。更现实的可能性是，她将在这场行动中丧生，而他多年来为这个组织倾注了大量时间和资源，这一事实无疑加剧了他本已不堪重负的心灵走向疯狂。他带着悲痛回到家中，将妻子唤至书房。或许他向她透露了所知的一切，或许他直接开枪射杀了她，又或许他在唤她之前，反复书写了数百遍“对不起”。无论如何，结局都是一样的。他们双双倒在血泊中，鲜血不断蔓延。NERV 甚至没有派人调查他为何未出现在工作岗位上，假设这一切发生在事件发生前的几天。

Asuka beats her fists against Shinji's arms and back. This was not how she wanted to remember them, damnit. This was not the way they should have ended up! They had been distant from her, but they were her family. However they might have treated her growing up, her family was still some part of her. And it had been destroyed by a group of old men trying to control things they had no business in. In that moment she could have strangled each of the old farts heading SEELE and NERV. Gendou, Keel, Ritsuko, Fallah, Pearl, others. They were dark thoughts about dark people. It didn't make her feel better.  
明日香用拳头捶打着真嗣的胳膊和后背。该死，她不想这样记住他们。这不应该是他们的结局！他们虽然与她疏远，但毕竟是她的家人。无论他们成长过程中如何对待她，家人仍然是她的一部分。然而，这一切却被一群试图控制他们无权干涉之事的老头子摧毁了。那一刻，她真想掐死 SEELE 和 NERV 的那些老顽固。源堂、基尔、律子、法拉、珀尔，还有其他人。这些都是关于阴暗之人的阴暗念头。这并没有让她感觉好些。

A half hour later, the two teens sat on the curb outside the house, Asuka leaning against Shinji. She had cried several times in the intervening minutes and was doing so now. At one time, Asuka had vowed that she would not cry for anyone. Unfortunately age (15) and experience had a way of dictating how well you can keep a promise to yourself like that. As someone who had contemplated motherhood recently, and someone who had hoped to reconcile her feelings for her father while she was here, the pain of seeing them like that been overwhelming.  
半小时后，两个少年坐在屋外的路边，明日香靠在真嗣身上。在这段时间里，她已经哭了好几次，现在还在哭。曾经，明日香发誓她不会为任何人哭泣。不幸的是，年龄（15 岁）和经历总有办法决定你能多么坚定地遵守这样的自我承诺。作为一个最近思考过母性的人，以及一个希望在此期间与父亲和解的人，看到他们那样的痛苦是难以承受的。

As someone who had considered suicide some time back, the identification of the hopelessness and despair that her father must have felt hurt a lot too. It was that despair that really did it she thought. To be reminded of the importance of someone in your life through betrayal. At the same time, wasn't that what was happening to her? She had dismissed, perhaps not easily, her father as a man who did not really think of her as a daughter. And now she found that there was importance in him as family because of his agony at the betrayal he experienced.  
作为一个曾经考虑过自杀的人，她深切体会到父亲当时必定感受到的绝望与无助，这种感觉同样令她心痛。正是这种绝望，她想，才是真正的关键。通过背叛来提醒你生命中某个人的重要性。与此同时，她自己不也正经历着类似的事情吗？她曾轻视，或许并不轻易，将父亲视为一个并不真正把她当作女儿的人。而现在，她发现他在家庭中的重要性，正是因为他在背叛中所经历的痛苦。

After a few more minutes, she calmed again. Shinji had his arms around her, and was slowly rubbing one hand up and down her back. Time had changed her. The old Asuka would not have cried. The old Asuka would have been angry at being consoled. The old Asuka would likely be dead through suicide had not fate stepped in and given her a new lease on life. She took a deep breath and let it out.  
又过了几分钟，她再次平静下来。真嗣拥抱着她，缓缓地用手在她背上上下抚摸。时间改变了她。过去的明日香不会哭泣。过去的明日香会对安慰感到愤怒。若非命运介入，给了她新生的机会，过去的明日香可能早已因自杀而逝去。她深吸一口气，然后缓缓呼出。

"I wanted to see my room, but I don't want to go back in there. Let's leave this place, Shinji. It's bad, it's spoiled, and I don't think anything will ever make it right again." She pulled her head away so that she could look at him. The corners of her mouth pursed and drew down as she held back another episode of grief. "When those people are done thawing or whatever, let's leave Germany."  
“我想看看我的房间，但我不想再回去了。我们离开这里吧，真嗣。这里已经坏了，被毁了，我觉得再也不会有什么能让它恢复原样了。”她把头移开，以便能看着他。她的嘴角紧抿，努力抑制住又一波的悲伤。“等那些人解冻或者别的什么处理完之后，我们离开德国吧。”

Shinji nodded, and kissed her on the forehead and then the mouth. They would go somewhere else. The Germany that Asuka had known would never return, and it would never be home again.  
真嗣点点头，吻了吻她的额头，然后是嘴唇。他们将去往别处。明日香所熟悉的德国永远不会回来了，也再也不会是家了。

The food stores at NERV were, on subsequent inspection, larger than they had originally though. Someone there had taken the initiative to stockpile emergency rations by the pallet. These were marked with property statements of a number of world militaries and companies. Some of them were dehydrated, others were super-pasteurized, still others where stabilized raw ingredients.  
经过后续检查，NERV 的食品储备比他们最初想象的要大得多。那里有人主动囤积了成托盘的应急口粮。这些口粮上标有多个世界军事组织和公司的财产声明。其中一些是脱水的，另一些是超高温灭菌的，还有一些是稳定处理的原材料。

In an effort to stay busy and divert their thought for the next week, they took to finding trucks and loading stored items that they thought might be useful onto them. At first this was hazardous as it had been some time since either had driven a car, and the trucks they were obtaining were larger than anything they previously had handled. On the first day, Asuka and Shinji both had run a Mercedes flatbed truck into a wall backwards due to clutch and shifting problems. Now, 8 days later, there were seven trucks staged at the exit to the facility. The front two had an amalgam of items, food, clothing, survival and camping gear that was much better that what they had brought with them.  
为了保持忙碌并转移下周的注意力，他们开始寻找卡车并将认为可能有用的储存物品装载上去。起初这很危险，因为他们已经很久没有开过车了，而且他们获取的卡车比之前处理过的任何车辆都要大。第一天，明日香和真嗣因为离合器和换挡问题，将一辆奔驰平板卡车倒着撞到了墙上。现在，8 天过去了，已经有七辆卡车在设施出口处待命。最前面的两辆车上装满了各种物品，包括食物、衣物、生存和露营装备，这些都比他们带来的要好得多。

On the back of each were the motorcycles they had claimed so many months ago in Japan. Whoever had owned those motorcycles, and the others that were in his garage, he surely never thought they would travel so far. From their factory in the United States (and in Shinji's motocycle's case wherever else it had gone in the intervening years) to Japan to Central Europe, and now to points unknown.  
每辆卡车的后面是他们几个月前在日本夺取的摩托车。无论是谁拥有那些摩托车，以及他车库里的其他摩托车，他肯定从未想过它们会走这么远。从美国的工厂（以及真嗣摩托车的案例中，在这些年里它去过的其他地方）到日本，再到中欧，现在又到了未知的地方。

The thawing process was nearing its completion. The computer reported that there were abnormalities in two of the specimens that were detected during the animation. One, a male, would not recover. He was currently at 29 degrees Celsius, and repeated attempts to start his heart had failed. He was dead.  
解冻过程已接近尾声。计算机报告称，在复苏过程中检测到两具标本存在异常。其中一名男性无法恢复，目前体温为 29 摄氏度，多次尝试启动其心脏均告失败，他已死亡。

The other, a female, had two heartbeats. The computer concluded that she was at least 2 months pregnant and that barring any unforeseen events, both would survive the procedure. Asuka was thank for that last news. With the events the previous week, she didn't want any more bad things to happen to children or parents.  
另一名女性则有两个心跳。计算机推断她至少怀孕两个月，且除非发生意外，母子均能挺过这一过程。对此，明日香感到欣慰。经历了上周的事件后，她不希望再有任何不幸降临到孩子或父母身上。

They started taking shifts in the cryo lab on the last day of the procedure. There were 50 recovery beds in two adjoining rooms. Asuka and Shinji had made up 34 of these and prepared a sheet and wool blanket for the unfortunate man who died without waking up. Each of the beds had an electric warming blanket as well as a bag of fluid, a needle or two and some swabs.  
在程序的最后一天，他们开始轮流在低温实验室值班。两个相连的房间内共有 50 张恢复床。明日香和真嗣占据了其中的 34 张，并为那位未曾醒来便离世的不幸男子准备了一张床单和羊毛毯。每张床上都配备了一条电热毯、一袋液体、一两根针和一些棉签。

After reading through several technical documents regarding the process, Asuka filled Shinji in on what they could expect as far as how to treat the people coming out. Most of them would likely be unconscious for a day or two. A final series of drugs were necessary to be administered to ease their recuperation. Unfortunately it didn't say anything about what to do if the patient was awake.  
在浏览了几份关于该过程的技术文件后，Asuka 向 Shinji 详细说明了他们可以预料到的对待苏醒者的方式。大多数人可能会昏迷一两天。最后一系列药物是必要的，以促进他们的恢复。不幸的是，文件中并没有提到如果患者醒着该怎么办。

---

The two exhausted teens sat propped against the wall in the main lab room. Shinji tried unsuccessfully to stifle a yawn, and Asuka followed suit with a yawn of her own half a minute later. It had been a trying two days. The patients, volunteers, specimens, people, whatever you wanted to call them were sleeping off the last of the effects of the cryogenic process that had been their existence for many months.  
两个疲惫不堪的少年背靠在主实验室的墙上。Shinji 试图抑制住一个哈欠，但没有成功，而 Asuka 则在半分钟后也跟着打了个哈欠。这已经是艰难的两天了。那些患者，志愿者，样本，人，无论你想怎么称呼他们，都在沉睡中度过着冷冻过程带来的最后影响，这个过程已经持续了数月。

Asuka and Shinji had helped each one out of the human shaped form they were stood in as it rose out of the large contraption. Each person was covered in a viscous blue gel which oozed off of them and got all over the place. It smelled sickly-sweet and the color was not appetizing at all. The patients were initially clothed in a white one-piece body suit which needed to be removed and thrown away. They would then quickly be washed, dried and placed in one of the made beds, and the heating pad would be placed on them.  
明日香和真嗣帮助每个人从那个大型装置中升起的人形形态中解脱出来。每个人都被一种黏稠的蓝色凝胶覆盖，这些凝胶从他们身上渗出，弄得到处都是。气味甜腻得令人作呕，颜色也完全不诱人。患者最初穿着一件白色的一体式紧身衣，需要脱下并丢弃。随后，他们会被迅速清洗、擦干并安置在一张准备好的床上，然后加热垫会被放置在他们身上。

Shinji hadn't really given much thought to how much work that was, but now that it was over, he realized how naïve he'd been. The one exception was a young woman, not the pregnant woman, who had come out gibbering about flying, and missiles, and board games, and chocolate, and cats, and several topics that Shinji couldn't quite keep track of. She was animated, she was confused, she nearly slipped and busted her fool head open. She thought she had to pee, but tried to and couldn't. At this point, Asuka threw up her hands, wrangled the lady into the shower, washed her off none too delicately, then speed dried her and put her in bed where she promptly fell asleep.  
真嗣之前并没有真正考虑过这项工作的繁重程度，但现在一切都结束了，他意识到自己有多么天真。唯一的例外是一个年轻女子，不是那位孕妇，她出来时语无伦次地谈论着飞行、导弹、棋盘游戏、巧克力、猫以及真嗣无法完全跟上的几个话题。她情绪激动，困惑不已，差点滑倒摔破脑袋。她以为自己需要小便，但尝试后却无法做到。此时，明日香双手一摊，将这位女士拽进淋浴间，不太温柔地给她洗了个澡，然后迅速擦干并安置在床上，她立刻就睡着了。

They spent the next few hours taking temperatures, heart rates, and gave each a bag of saline to keep their fluids up. With that done they came out here to rest and wait.  
接下来的几个小时里，他们测量体温、心率，并给每人挂了一袋生理盐水以维持体液。完成这些后，他们便出来休息并等待。

Shinji swam back to consciousness with a dull murmuring echoing out of the darkness. It was someone speaking German, and he felt something on his shoulder. He lolled his head to the side and slapped at his shoulder half-heartedly. Struggling, he opened his eyes, and looked blearily around. In front of him a woman in a bedsheet and a man with a paper hospital gown on were leaning over them.  
真嗣在一片昏暗中被低沉的喃喃声唤醒，那是有人在说德语，他感觉肩膀上有东西。他无力地侧过头，半心半意地拍打着肩膀。挣扎着，他睁开眼睛，模糊地环顾四周。在他面前，一个裹着床单的女人和一个穿着纸质医院袍的男人正俯身看着他们。

He blinked a few times and jerked his head back, hitting it on the smooth steel side of the cabinet he was propped against. There was a brief dull pain in his head that helped clear him up enough to realize that these people were waking up finally. Furrowing his brow he concentrated on standing up. Asuka was speaking to the man, but he couldn't understand what was being said.  
他眨了几下眼，猛地向后仰头，撞到了支撑他的光滑钢制橱柜侧面。头部传来一阵短暂的钝痛，这让他清醒了一些，意识到这些人终于醒来了。他皱起眉头，集中精神试图站起来。明日香正在和那个男人说话，但他听不懂他们在说什么。

Then the man replied in English. "Well how long were we out? I don't understand. What is going on?"  
随后那人用英语回答道：“我们到底昏迷了多久？我不明白。这是怎么回事？”

Asuka looked to Shinji. They had spoken at length about how they would explain the situation. Metaphysical theory aside, everyone was gone, everyone except the two teens, and the 34 adults (they decided to leave out the 35th and the baby).  
明日香看向真嗣。他们曾详细讨论过如何解释这一情况。撇开形而上学理论不谈，所有人都消失了，除了这两个少年和 34 名成年人（他们决定不提第 35 个人和那个婴儿）。

"I think you need to come sit down in the other room. I'll try to explain everything, but you need to remain calm, OK?" Shinji, who was now fully awake and alert, started herding to two adults back into the male area, when they sat down on the bed that until recently had been occupied by the man.  
“我想你需要到另一个房间坐下来。我会尽力解释一切，但你必须保持冷静，好吗？”真嗣现在已经完全清醒并警觉起来，开始引导两位成年人回到男性区域，他们坐到了不久前还躺着那人的床上。

In the back, someone yawned loudly. "Before I tell you the specifics, I am going to come out and give you the bottom line." They both nodded. Ah, how unready were they for this? "Everyone is dead. Everyone besides who you see here and the other room, they are all gone."  
后方，有人大声打了个哈欠。“在我告诉你们具体细节之前，我先直截了当地告诉你们底线。”他们俩都点了点头。啊，他们对此是多么准备不足啊？“所有人都死了。除了你们在这里看到的和另一个房间的人，其他人都已经不在了。”

He let that sink in for a few seconds.  
他让这话沉淀了几秒钟。

"That can't be. That can't be true. How could everyone have died? Was it a sickness, how come you two didn't get it?" the woman blurted. The look on her face displayed the disbelief that the man likely felt as well, so Shinji started in on the short version.  
“这不可能。这不可能是真的。怎么可能所有人都死了？是疾病吗，为什么你们俩没事？”女人脱口而出。她脸上的表情显示出她与那男人同样的不信，于是真嗣开始简述事情的经过。

"We are living in a Post-Third-Impact world. It happened, but instead of a meteorite, it was an event that was orchestrated by the people running NERV. They found a way to" here he searched for a word for a few seconds, "dis-incorporate everyone's bodies, and drew their conciousn… Never mind that. Suffice to say that they are gone, and I don't think they are coming back." He hung his head. He had gotten wrapped up in the how of the event, when he didn't even really know what the event was. How crazy did it sound?  
"我们生活在一个后第三次冲击的世界。它发生了，但不是陨石，而是一场由 NERV 高层策划的事件。他们找到了一种方法，将每个人的身体'解体'，并抽取了他们的意识……算了，别管这些细节。总之，他们消失了，我觉得他们不会再回来了。" 他低下头。他陷入了事件的细节之中，甚至不太清楚事件本身是什么。这听起来有多疯狂？

The two adults were giving them the unbelieving look that adults reserve for things that don't fit with their version of reality. "You know what?" Asuka said frustrated. "Let the computer tell them what happened. It won't hold anything back. They can get all of the details in nice cold facts and figures."  
两位成年人用那种成年人特有的、对不符合他们现实认知的事物表示怀疑的眼神看着他们。"你知道吗？"明日香沮丧地说，"让电脑告诉他们发生了什么。它不会隐瞒任何事情。他们可以得到所有冷冰冰的事实和数据。

Asuka queried for reports generated from data related to Tokyo-3, the dates immediately surrounding the Third Impact, and sensor readings for anything the MAGI had connectivity to in the aftermath of the event. What greeted them was a lifeless clinical description of the event.  
明日香查询了与第三新东京市相关的报告，即第三次冲击前后日期的数据，以及事件后 MAGI 系统连接到的任何传感器的读数。他们所面对的是一份毫无生气的、临床式的对事件的描述。

"31 DECEMBER 2015 AT 2045 LOCAL (UTC+9) NERV FORCES ALONG WITH ELEMENTS OF THE JAPAN SPECIAL SELF DEFENSE FORCE INITIATED COMBAT OPERATIONS ON THE NERV FACILITY AT TOKYO-3, JAPAN IN AN ATTEMPT TO 1). PREVENT THE USE OF EVANGELION ASSETS AT THAT LOCATION FROM INTERFERING WITH SEELE INTERESTS, 2). USE THE EVANGELION ASSETS TO FURTHER THOSE INTERESTS, 3).

REPORT ENDS" 报告结束

---

In the end, the computer's report was the proof and description that most of them needed. The remaining adults as they awoke and sought explanation were directed to the computer and then filled in by the others. Dr Richter, it turned out, was not completely truthful about the source of the volunteers. At least twelve of the women and 10 of the men remembered going to sleep then waking up in the beds at the cryo facility. However, true to his word, no one had been told anything about SEELE or NERV.  
最终，计算机的报告成为了他们大多数人所需的证据和描述。当剩余的成年人醒来并寻求解释时，他们被引导至计算机，随后由其他人进行补充说明。事实证明，里希特博士关于志愿者来源的说法并不完全真实。至少有十二名女性和十名男性记得自己入睡后，醒来时却躺在冷冻设施的床上。然而，正如他承诺的那样，没有人被告知关于 SEELE 或 NERV 的任何信息。

They consisted of 15 men, between the ages of 27 and 38 composed of 13 nationalities, and 19 women between 26 and 36 of 19 nationalities. Some careful thought had been put into the selection of these individuals. Each was from a different ethnic, economic and professional background. Over the course of the next day and a half their stories exchanged and everyone was introduced. Asuka and Shinji had provided leftover uniforms take from storage. These were jumpsuits in several colors and an array of sizes. Asuka took the pregnant woman, an Australian named Linda off to the side and let her in on the secret if she was not already aware. She wasn't and when she returned to the group she was blushing profusely and was understandably distracted.  
他们共有 15 名男性，年龄介于 27 至 38 岁之间，来自 13 个不同的国家；以及 19 名女性，年龄在 26 至 36 岁之间，来自 19 个不同的国家。这些人的选择经过了深思熟虑，每位成员都来自不同的种族、经济和职业背景。在接下来的一天半里，他们的故事相互交流，每个人都做了自我介绍。明日香和真嗣提供了从仓库中取出的剩余制服，这些制服有多种颜色和尺码。明日香带着一位名叫琳达的澳大利亚孕妇走到一旁，向她透露了秘密，如果她之前还不知情的话。她确实不知情，当她回到人群中时，满脸通红，显然心不在焉。

"So we're the only ones left, I get that. We need to figure out what happens next, I think." Klaus asked loudly. He had been an automotive engineer at Mercedes previously.  
“所以我们是仅存的人了，我明白这一点。我们需要弄清楚接下来该怎么办，我想。”克劳斯大声说道。他之前是梅赛德斯奔驰的汽车工程师。

"Asuka and I've already decided to leave this base and go somewhere else." Shinji stated flatly. Then with some sadness "There's too much here that reminds us of the people who did this."  
“明日香和我已经决定离开这个基地，去别的地方。”真嗣平静地说道。然后带着一丝悲伤，“这里太多东西让我们想起那些做下这一切的人。”

"Where do you plan to go that is better than here? We have power, we have food, and there are supplies that would last us for years here as well as all the technology you could want. Out there is only work and sweat and difficulty." Emmanuelle countered waving her hand toward the outside. Emmanuelle had been sous chef at a fine French restaurant.  
"你打算去哪里会比这里更好？我们有电力，有食物，还有足够维持我们数年的物资，以及你想要的所有科技。外面只有辛劳、汗水和困难。" 伊曼纽尔反驳道，挥手向着外面。伊曼纽尔曾在一家高级法国餐厅担任副主厨。

"That's as may be, but we aren't staying here. I can't stay here." Asuka's almost somber tone suddenly changed when she saw a number of the people were siding with Emmanuelle to stay in Berlin. "You can stay here if you want! I absolutely refuse. I have been out there and I have worked hard to live, and I have to say that I would prefer it to having it all at my fingertips but reliant on the people who caused this whole mess. If you want to stay here, that's fine. If you want to come with us, that's great. If you want to go somewhere else, by all means." She looked to Shinji.  
"或许如此，但我们不会留在这里。我不能留在这里。" 明日香几乎忧郁的语气突然改变，当她看到许多人支持伊曼纽尔留在柏林时。"你想留在这里就留吧！我绝对拒绝。我曾在外面生活过，努力工作以求生存，我得说，我宁愿选择那种生活，也不愿依赖那些造成这一切混乱的人。如果你想留在这里，没关系。如果你想跟我们走，那很好。如果你想另寻他处，请便。" 她看向真嗣。

He nodded slowly. "It's been nearly two days since you came out, and we plan to leave in another two days. We would love to have you with us, but we also intend to live the way we see fit, so don't come with us if you want to lead the group or be in charge. There isn't anyone in charge. People in charge killed this planet."  
他缓缓点头。“你出来已经快两天了，我们计划再过两天就离开。我们很希望你能加入我们，但我们打算按照自己的方式生活，所以如果你想要领导这个团队或掌管一切，就不要跟我们走。这里没有谁是负责人。那些掌权者已经毁了这个星球。”

There were grumblings over why a 15 or 16 year old boy had any say in the matter, others responded that it looked like he had done some living in the last couple of years. Asuka pulled Shinji out of the room, and they spoke in lowered tones for a few minutes.  
有人嘀咕为什么一个 15、16 岁的男孩在这件事上有发言权，其他人则回应说，看起来他在过去几年里经历了不少。明日香把真嗣拉出房间，他们低声交谈了几分钟。

When they came back, Asuka cleared her throat and stated with no equivocation, "We're leaving Berlin the day after tomorrow at 0900. We have 7 trucks staged at the entrance to the tunnel, you may have seen them when we went to the surface earlier. Before you came out, we loaded them with supplies. Each one is loaded with the same items, except two which have our motor cycles on them. Anyone staying, you have run of the facility and thus all of the remaining stores, which are considerable. We're taking two trucks with us. Any groups that are leaving will have to divide the other 5 trucks among you.  
"他们回来后，明日香清了清嗓子，毫不含糊地说：“我们后天早上 9 点离开柏林。我们在隧道入口处准备了 7 辆卡车，你们可能在我们之前到地面上时见过。在你出来之前，我们已经装载了物资。每辆车都装载了相同的物品，除了两辆装有我们的摩托车。任何留下的人，你们可以自由使用设施内剩余的大量物资。我们将带走两辆卡车。任何离开的团队必须分配剩下的 5 辆卡车。”

"We plan to return to Italy, maybe re-boarding the boat we sailed here on, maybe finding a different one. If anyone decides later to join us, that is where we'll be at least for a few days. I can highlight our route on a map, I guess, so that you will be able to find us." She surveyed the group. "I don't mean to be so short with you. I haven't had the best experience here, and frankly I don't intend to stay any longer than I have to. Shinji and I have lived for some time with no real problems. We're… as married as two people can be nowadays." She sighed and folded her hands. "I am sure that you look at us and see two highschoolers, and by narrow definition, that is who we are. We have also battled aliens in giant, for lack of a better term, robots. Shinji is the sole reason any of us are here now. I am a college graduate. We have both sailed over nearly a third of the world and have lived in that post apocalypse for the better part of a year. I intend to have children someday and I want to help ensure that this…" she gestured at everything "NEVER happens again. So far as I am concerned, this place is cursed with the bad deeds of bad people."  
"我们计划返回意大利，或许重新登上我们乘来此地的船，或许另寻一艘。若有人日后决定加入我们，那至少在接下来的几天里，我们会在那里。我想我可以在地图上标出我们的路线，这样你们就能找到我们了。" 她环视了众人。"我并非有意对你们如此简短。在这里的经历并不愉快，坦白说，我无意久留。真嗣和我已经共同生活了一段时间，没有遇到什么大问题。我们……在当今时代，可以说是如夫妻般的关系。" 她叹了口气，双手交叠。"我确信，在你们眼中，我们只是两个高中生，从狭义上讲，确实如此。但我们也曾驾驶着巨型，姑且称之为机器人，与外星人战斗。真嗣是我们如今能在此的唯一原因。我已大学毕业。我们俩航行了近乎世界三分之一的海域，并在那场末日后生活了近一年。我希望能有一天拥有孩子，并希望尽我所能确保这一切……" 她挥手指向四周，"永远不会再次发生。就我所见，这个地方被恶人的恶行所诅咒。"

Without another word, she spun on her heel and left the room.  
她没有再多说一句话，转身便离开了房间。

The next night, while Shinji was cleaning up the plates that they had just eaten on, James, an English fellow who had been an electrical engineer, came walking up the tunnel road and out through the roll-up doors. Asuka and Shinji had re-occupied their tents outside the facility the previous night. James called out to them to announce his presence long before he strode into the lantern light.  
第二天晚上，当真嗣正在收拾他们刚用过的盘子时，詹姆斯，一个曾是电气工程师的英国人，沿着隧道公路走来，穿过卷帘门。前一晚，明日香和真嗣重新占据了设施外的帐篷。詹姆斯在走进灯笼光之前就大声呼喊，以宣告他的到来。

"Asuka, I want to let you and Shinji know that we, that is a group of us, intend to come with you tomorrow. It's myself and 7 other blokes, and 12 of the ladies." He wrung his hands for a few seconds before continuing, "I'm afraid I have some bad news at the same time. Just a little while ago one of the ladies Harah, and a gentleman I never learned his name… they found the armory and… I guess they just couldn't reconcile their situation."  
“明日香，我想告诉你们，我和其他一些人打算明天和你们一起走。包括我自己和另外七个男人，还有十二位女士。”他双手紧握了几秒钟，然后继续说道，“同时，我恐怕也有一些坏消息。就在不久前，一位名叫哈拉的女士和一位我从未得知其姓名的先生……他们找到了军械库，而且……我想他们无法接受自己的处境。”

Asuka's eyes were downcast, and she wiped at one, but Shinji could not see if she was in fact crying. She nodded but kept her head down. "Thanks, James."  
明日香的眼眸低垂，她擦拭着其中一只眼睛，但真嗣看不清她是否真的在哭泣。她点点头，但始终低着头。“谢谢你，詹姆斯。”

"Just to be sure, you plan to leave tomorrow at 0900 right?"  
“只是确认一下，你打算明天早上九点出发对吧？”

Shinji smiled and nodded although he was not happy given the news about the suicides. "That's right. We welcome you to come with us. Are there any other groups leaving or is everyone else presumably staying here?"  
真嗣微笑着点头，尽管得知自杀的消息让他并不开心。“没错。我们欢迎你和我们一起走。还有其他团体要离开吗，还是其他人预计都会留在这里？”

"Ah, about that. One man, I think his name is Macha, and a woman, have decided to strike out on their own. I don't know what ethnicity Macha is, but he said he lived in Poland before, and the woman is from Minsk in Belarus. They were looking through the storage area for backpacks earlier, I am not sure if they found anything serviceable though. And another bloke is intent on traveling to South Africa. I don't think he quite believes it yet."  
"啊，关于那个。有个男人，我想他叫马查，还有个女人，决定自己出去闯一闯。我不清楚马查是哪国人，但他之前住在波兰，而那女人来自白俄罗斯的明斯克。他们之前在储藏区找背包，我不确定他们是否找到了能用的。还有个人执意要去南非。我觉得他还没完全相信这事儿。"

"That isn't going to leave many people here, is it? Four men, five women, is that it?"  
"那这里剩下的人就不多了，对吧？四个男的，五个女的，就这些了吗？"

James appeared to mentally count and then nodded. "Fraid so. But, if the power holds out, and I imagine that it will cause I looked up the generators at that canal bridge, and they are Brommer tens, they should be alright for a while."  
詹姆斯似乎在心里默默数了一遍，然后点头道：“恐怕是的。不过，如果电力能维持住，我想应该没问题，因为我查过那座运河桥上的发电机，是布罗默牌的，应该能撑一段时间。”

"Alright. Who all is coming with us? Who can we count on?"  
"好吧。谁会跟我们一起？我们可以依靠谁？"

"Well, besides myself, there's Hugo, he's a software guy I think, there's Klaus, he was a mechanic, sorry, and Automotive Engineer, let's see, we got Wei, he said he did dive maintenance for the Three Gorges Dam.  
"嗯，除了我之外，还有雨果，我想他是搞软件的，还有克劳斯，他以前是机械师，抱歉，是汽车工程师，让我想想，还有魏，他说他在三峡大坝负责潜水维护。"

"Next we got…" James held up his hands for a second as if to say 'Please bear with me', "John Dancing Raven, he says he is Lakota and a blacksmith and a farrier. There's Mikhail, he's a Russian accountant, and there's Sameer, he was a construction foreman in Yemen I think, and Abdou is a dock worker from Senegal. To tell you the truth, I am not even sure where Senegal is."  
"接下来我们有……"" 詹姆斯举起双手，仿佛在说“请耐心听我说”，""约翰·丹辛·雷文，他说他是拉科塔人，既是铁匠也是蹄铁匠。还有米哈伊尔，他是俄罗斯的会计，还有萨米尔，我想他以前是也门的建筑工头，阿布杜是塞内加尔的码头工人。说实话，我甚至不太确定塞内加尔在哪里。"

Shinji was having a hard time keeping this strait, and he was sure there would be problems keeping all of these people correct in his head.  
真嗣觉得保持这一切井井有条很困难，他确信自己会遇到问题，无法将所有这些人的信息都记清楚。

"I'm not too sure about the ladies. I have spoken to a couple of them, but really I don't talk to women much; never been too good at it, y'know? So there's Linda, she Aussie, pretty sure she said she was an attorney at some point, there's Fenna she's from Holland, but I don't know what she did, she did give me a wink though, so there is that. And I know a woman named Maddie, maybe Madeleine? She is French, but I also don't know what she does. As for the rest, I haven't spoken to them really. They just came over, and either asked if they could come with, or they asked if we were going with you two, and _then_ they asked if they could come with." James finally stopped speaking. Asuka saw right away that he was a talkative one. While there was nothing wrong with it, it did tend to get bothersome to listen to after a while.  
"我对女士们不太确定。我跟其中几位聊过，但其实我不太擅长与女性交谈，你知道的，一直都不太行。比如琳达，她是澳大利亚人，我记得她提到过自己是律师；还有芬娜，她来自荷兰，但我不知道她的职业，不过她确实对我眨了眨眼，这点倒是挺有趣的。我还认识一个叫麦迪或玛德琳的女人，她是法国人，但我也不清楚她的工作。至于其他人，我其实没怎么跟她们交谈过。她们只是过来，要么问能不能跟我们一起，要么问我们是不是要跟你们俩一起，然后她们就问能不能加入。" 詹姆斯终于停止了说话。明日香立刻看出他是个健谈的人。虽然这没什么不好，但听久了确实会有些烦人。

"Alright, James, thanks for the info, both good and bad. Tell the others that we welcome them with us, and thanks for trusting us enough to come with us, could you?" Shinji stood and shook James' hand.  
"好的，詹姆斯，谢谢你的信息，不管是好是坏。告诉其他人，我们欢迎他们加入我们，也感谢他们信任我们，愿意跟我们一起，可以吗？" 真嗣站起来，与詹姆斯握了握手。

"No worries, Shinji. I will do that. Asuka, I really am sorry that I was the bearer of such bad news."  
“别担心，真嗣。我会处理的。明日香，我真的很抱歉带来了这样的坏消息。”

She sighed heavily. "It's OK, James. Better to know so that you can say good-bye, whether we knew them well or not, I suppose we can give them at least that."  
她重重地叹了口气。“没关系，詹姆斯。早点知道也好，这样我们至少能好好道别，无论我们与他们是否熟悉，我想至少能给他们这个。”

With that, James ambled back inside. He would pass along the sorrowful sentiments to the others and the welcomes to the party that was forming for tomorrow.  
说完，詹姆斯慢悠悠地走回屋内。他会将这些悲伤的情感传达给其他人，以及明天聚会的热情欢迎。

---

Late that night, Shinji awoke to the sound of an engine starting up. He poked his head out just in time to see a small 2 door car passing out of sight with Asuka at the wheel. He scrambled into his clothes, found a car they had been using to get around in a few days earlier nearby, and followed her as best he could. He knew where she was going though.  
深夜时分，真嗣被引擎启动的声音惊醒。他探头望去，正好看到一辆两门小轿车在明日香驾驶下消失在视线中。他匆忙穿上衣服，找到几天前他们用来代步的一辆车，尽可能地紧随其后。不过，他知道她要去哪里。

A few wrong turns and a long trip around a crazy interchange later, he pulled up to Asuka's former home for the second time. The front door was open, and he could see faint light reflecting off of a window on the right side of the house.  
几次错误的转弯和绕过一个复杂的立交桥后，他第二次来到了明日香曾经的家。前门敞开着，他能看到微弱的灯光从房子右侧的窗户反射出来。

He walked up to the front door and cleared his throat to let her know that he was there, then stepped inside and carefully made his way through the dark (very dark) house. Sure enough, she was in the study. The chairs in front of the desk had been moved behind it, and Asuka sat on the floor with her parents wrapped in white sheets.  
他走到前门，清了清嗓子让她知道他来了，然后踏进屋内，小心翼翼地在黑暗（非常黑暗）中穿行。果然，她在书房里。书桌前的椅子被移到了书桌后，明日香坐在地板上，父母被白布包裹着。

"Shinji, could you help me bury them? I didn't know what I would do when I drove here, but that is what I want, and I don't think I have do it alone." She sniffed softly, and nodded to herself.  
“真嗣，你能帮我埋葬它们吗？我开车来的时候不知道自己会做什么，但现在我想这么做，而且我觉得我不应该独自完成。”她轻轻吸了吸鼻子，然后对自己点了点头。

"Yeah, I can do that, Asuka. You hold on here for a while."  
“嗯，我可以帮忙，明日香。你在这里稍等一会儿。”

Outside in the garden shed he found a couple of shovels and a tarp. He lay the tarp out on the long grass as well as he could then started shoveling out small bits of the grassy earth onto the tarp. It was hard going for a while as the grass made it difficult. Asuka came out and joined him in digging. They dug a somewhat shallow grave of four feet. There were some bags of concrete in the shed that they decided to lay in the grave above the deceased. In the absence of rocks, it would suffice to keep anything from digging down too far.  
他在外面的花园棚子里找到了几把铲子和一块防水布。他尽可能好地将防水布铺在长草地上，然后开始将小块的草地土铲到防水布上。起初很费劲，因为草地很碍事。明日香出来加入了他的挖掘工作。他们挖了一个大约四英尺深的浅坑。棚子里有一些水泥袋，他们决定将这些水泥袋放在坑里死者的上方。在没有石头的情况下，这足以防止任何东西挖得太深。

They lay the bodies side by side in the hole, and Asuka stared at them for some time. She regretted the way she had treated her step mother who had only ever wanted to help her. She forgave her father for his inattentiveness. He had paid a price for it in mental anguish that she would not have wished on him. She managed to choke out a good-bye for them. She had never believed in Heaven, but she hoped that there was somewhere they would go.  
他们将尸体并排放在坑中，明日香凝视了许久。她后悔曾经那样对待一心只想帮助她的继母。她原谅了父亲的不关心，他为此付出了精神上的痛苦，这是她不愿他承受的。她勉强挤出了一句再见。她从不相信天堂，但她希望他们能去往某个地方。

Quietly she started scooping dirt into the grave, and a moment later Shinji did the same. After a foot or two of dirt had been replaced, they carefully laid three sacks of concrete in, then pulled the tarp across the hole filling it. They packed the mound of dirt down with the shovels then discarded them and the tarp. Asuka went back inside wiping the sweat from her forehead with a sleeve. "Are you going to be alright, Asuka?"  
她静静地开始往墓穴里填土，片刻后真嗣也加入了。当填上了一两英尺的土后，他们小心翼翼地放进了三袋混凝土，然后拉过防水布覆盖在坑上。他们用铲子将土堆压实，随后丢弃了铲子和防水布。明日香回到屋内，用袖子擦去额头的汗水。“你还好吗，明日香？”

She waved back at him. "Yeah. I want to get something and then I will be out in a few minutes.  
"她向他挥了挥手。“嗯，我想拿点东西，然后几分钟就出来。”

Nodding to himself solemnly, Shinji circled around the house to the front and sat on the brick porch in front of the door. The moon had come out within the last hour and illuminated the street a little. From inside there was some creaking, and other soft sounds. Then he heard Asuka coming down the steps and out the front door. In her hands she held a small book with a tiny lock on it. He guessed correctly that this was a diary. She said nothing, but just got into the passenger seat of the car that he arrived in.  
慎司郑重其事地点了点头，绕到房子前面，坐在门前的砖砌门廊上。月亮在过去的一个小时内已经升起，照亮了街道。屋内传来一些吱吱嘎嘎的声音和其他细微的声响。随后，他听到明日香从楼梯上走下来，出了前门。她手里拿着一本带小锁的小书。他猜对了，这是一本日记。她什么也没说，只是坐进了他来时乘坐的汽车副驾驶座。

The trip back to their tent was silent. Shinji decided not to ask about the diary. Asuka would share with him when and if she was ready, and he would be there to comfort her in dealing with the pain that she had to get out.  
返回帐篷的途中一片寂静。慎司决定不问关于日记的事。明日香会在她准备好的时候与他分享，而他会在那里安慰她，帮助她处理必须释放的痛苦。

After they arrived, and were getting ready to sleep, he looked at his watch. Just after 0400. If they got up in three hours, they would have enough time to take a quick shower inside (they were both really sweaty) and make any final preparations to depart. It would be rough tomorrow, though.  
到达后，他们准备睡觉时，他看了看手表。刚过凌晨四点。如果他们三小时后起床，就有足够的时间快速洗个澡（两人都汗流浃背），并做好出发前的最后准备。不过，明天会很艰难。

---

Shinji and Asuka, James, Fenna, and the others in the party as well as the remaining members of the cryo group were gathered at the exit of the tunnel. The trucks were staged there in the far right outbound lane, ready to take them to wherever. Some discussion had been made about this, but nobody could decide on a destination right now.  
真嗣、明日香、詹姆斯、芬娜以及派对上的其他人，还有剩余的冷冻小组成员，都聚集在隧道的出口处。卡车已经停在了最右侧的出站车道上，准备随时带他们前往任何地方。关于这一点已经进行了一些讨论，但目前没有人能决定目的地。

Those staying or leaving later stood back, separate from the leaving party. Shinji cleared his throat, and stepped forward with a bottle of wine, to give it to Franc. "I know this doesn't mean as much as it would had I bought it, but I want you to know that we don't want to leave on bad terms. We are all in this, and if ever you need anything, we will be ready to help, but we will be far away. Once we get to where we are going, I am sure we can find some way to communicate, radio or something."  
那些留下或稍后离开的人站在一旁，与即将离开的队伍分开。真嗣清了清嗓子，拿着一瓶葡萄酒走上前，递给弗朗克。“我知道这瓶酒如果是我买的，意义会更大，但我希望你知道，我们不想带着不愉快离开。我们都在一起，如果将来你需要什么帮助，我们会随时准备伸出援手，尽管我们将会相隔甚远。一旦我们到达目的地，我相信我们能找到某种方式保持联系，比如无线电之类的。”

Shinji stepped back and nudged Asuka, who spoke up. "Take care of one another, and good luck. I'm sorry that we couldn't all stay together."  
真嗣退后一步，轻轻推了推明日香，她随即开口说道：“请大家互相照顾，祝你们好运。很抱歉我们不能一起留下来。”

James shook hands with Franc and several of the others in the staying group. He figured they would likely never meet again. While there was every possibility that they could in fact get a VLF radio going to talk to the others, he doubted that there would ever be much actual communication between them.  
詹姆斯与弗朗克及留下来小组中的几个人握手告别。他觉得他们可能再也不会见面了。尽管有各种可能通过甚低频无线电与外界联系，但他怀疑他们之间会有多少真正的交流。

They climbed aboard the trucks, 3 or 4 per truck and started the engines. As they pulled out, Asuka in the lead, Shinji stayed back in the rear. He looked in the mirror and saw two men and three women waving good-bye. That gave him hope but made him sad all the same. "I'm sorry."  
他们爬上卡车，每辆车坐三四个人，然后启动引擎。当他们出发时，明日香领头，真嗣留在最后。他通过后视镜看到两个男人和三个女人挥手告别。这给了他希望，但也同样让他感到悲伤。“对不起。”

### Chapter 18 Voyage

For those that have read this far, I would like to say thank you for your readership. I took about 10 years off writing this story, and I don't really have much in the way of reasons, only excuses.  
对于一路阅读至此的各位，我想表达衷心的感谢。我暂停创作这部作品大约有十年之久，至于原因，实在乏善可陈，唯有诸多借口罢了。

Things have changed a lot for me since I started this story, and now that I am getting back to it, I find that it still has the power to let me exorcise those inner demons. I plan to finish this, but more than that I want to start a story that is completely mine. To do that, I really need some good criticism. I need you to tell me what I am doing wrong. "Dialog is too wordy" "Too much explanation, not enough action", "Characters are unbelievable", "Too much assumed knowledge". If you feel that there is something wrong with the writing STYLE, please tell me. I need to know so that I can make it better. This story has, up to the point where Shinji and Asuka arrived in Italy on their way to Germany, been written without any plan or unified direction. I did not want to undo the previous work, but to fashion an "ending" I have to have some sort of ending conditions, which in turn requires an arc. The last chapters are an attempt to shoehorn an meaningful arc in and provide for some resolution (even though there was little in the way of conflict throughout the story).  
自从我开始这个故事以来，我的生活发生了很大变化，现在我重新投入其中，发现它依然有力量让我驱散内心的恶魔。我计划完成它，但更重要的是，我想开始一个完全属于我自己的故事。为此，我真的很需要一些好的批评。我需要你们告诉我哪里做错了。“对话过于冗长”，“解释太多，行动不足”，“角色不可信”，“假设的知识太多”。如果你们觉得写作风格有问题，请告诉我。我需要知道，以便改进。这个故事，直到真嗣和明日香抵达意大利前往德国为止，都是没有计划或统一方向的情况下写成的。我不想否定之前的工作，但要打造一个“结局”，我必须设定一些结束条件，这反过来又需要一个情节弧线。最后几章试图强行插入一个有意义的情节弧线，并提供一些解决（尽管整个故事中冲突不多）。

Once I am done with this, and after a good outlining, I will start on a wholly original story.  
完成这个故事并经过充分构思后，我将开始一个全新的原创故事。

I am including at the top of this chapter a Dramatis Personae. The explanation that James gave during the last chapter about everyone who would be joining the leaving party was pretty wordy and largely unnecessary, and I may go back and edit it down later. You may notice that Asuka is listed as American. It may be worth mentioning that her father was American, and her mother was German and Japanese.  
我在本章开头附上了一份角色表。上一章中詹姆斯关于即将加入告别派对的每个人的解释相当冗长且大多不必要，我可能会回头去编辑简化。你可能会注意到，Asuka 被列为美国人。值得一提的是，她的父亲是美国人，母亲则是德国和日本人。

The group had been at sea for two days when they saw Port Said breaking the horizon. Another two or three hours and they would be turning into the Suez Canal. Shinji looked off the stern of "Sloop John B" to the other ships in their naval convoy. Coming up directly astern was "Manticora" and just after "Let's Get Naughty-cal" both 40 meter solar yachts. Last in line was "Petit" which was a bit of a laugh because it was a 37 meter two-masted yacht.  
这群人出海已有两天，当他们看到塞得港在地平线上浮现时，再过两三个小时，他们就要驶入苏伊士运河了。真嗣从“约翰 B 号纵帆船”的船尾望向海军护航编队中的其他船只。紧随其后的是“曼提科拉号”，紧接着是“让我们放纵航海号”，这两艘都是 40 米长的太阳能游艇。最后是“小巧号”，这名字有点搞笑，因为它是一艘 37 米长的双桅游艇。

They had searched through the marina at Taranto upon arriving from Berlin, and had settled on these ships because they could hold all of the cargo, carry all of the passengers between them, and did not require fuel, with the exception of the small outboard motors on the two sailboats which were really only useful in port.  
他们从柏林抵达后，在塔兰托的码头仔细搜寻，最终选定了这些船只，因为它们能装载所有货物，承载所有乘客，而且除了两艘帆船上的小型舷外发动机（实际上只在港口有用）外，不需要燃料。

The biggest difficulty they had while in Taranto was finding radios that worked. Many had been left semi exposed to rain that got in through torn canvas covers or holes in roofs. Others had batteries that had corroded and made the battery connectors unserviceable.  
他们在塔兰托遇到的最大困难是找到能用的无线电。许多无线电因被半暴露在雨中，雨水通过破损的帆布罩或屋顶漏洞渗入而受损。其他无线电的电池则因腐蚀导致电池连接器无法使用。

On their last night in port, they had consumed a huge meal of pasta and homemade bread. The "Naughty-cal" had a large oven and Cassie and Shinji had baked a dozen loaves total to divide up among the ships. They had just finished loading and packing all of the ships, manifesting them, and checking communications that day, and now they were ready to leave, so why not celebrate a little?  
在港口的最后一晚，他们享用了一顿丰盛的意大利面和自制面包大餐。"Naughty-cal"号拥有一个大型烤箱，卡西和真嗣总共烤了十二条面包，准备分给各艘船。那天，他们刚刚完成了所有船只的装载、打包、显现和通讯检查工作，现在一切就绪，即将启航，何不小小庆祝一番？

Megumi, a Hirosaki native, had found a wine cellar in one of the homes nearby. Many of the bottles where sixty and seventy years old. Most of the adults had a glass or even two. Shinji and Asuka both had a few sips, but that was enough. Shinji had never been much for alcohol, Asuka too for that matter, and it did not take much to do them in.  
来自弘前市的惠美在附近的一栋房子里发现了一个酒窖。许多酒瓶都有六七十年的历史。大多数成年人都喝了一两杯。真嗣和明日香都只尝了几口，但那已经足够。真嗣向来不怎么喜欢酒精，明日香也是如此，他们很容易就会受到影响。

What happened later, in the privacy of their cabin, not entirely the product of the alcohol, had been welcome. Shinji and Asuka had not been intimate since arriving in Germany, and that night she had finally been feeling well enough mentally to want to make love. Shinji hoped still that the waves and the music from the next boat over had masked their activities, but he was unsure. James gave him a funny look the next day as if to ask "Feeling alright, hoss?"  
后来，在他们私密的船舱里发生的事情，并非完全是因为酒精的作用，而是他们所期待的。自从抵达德国后，真嗣和明日香就没有亲密过，而那晚她终于在精神上感觉良好，渴望做爱。真嗣仍希望海浪和邻船传来的音乐掩盖了他们的活动，但他也不确定。第二天，詹姆斯给了他一个奇怪的眼神，仿佛在问：“还好吗，伙计？”

"Yup, feeling pretty good, actually."  
"嗯，确实感觉挺好的。"

"Say again?" Asuka responded absently.  
"再说一遍？" 明日香心不在焉地回应道。

"Oh, uh, just thinking to myself that I am feeling particularly good." He pinched what he could of her nearest cheek clad in a pair of green shorts. It was warm out here on the water in the southern Mediterranean Sea.  
"哦，呃，只是在自言自语说我感觉特别好。" 他捏了捏她穿着绿色短裤的最近的脸颊。在这地中海的南部水域上，天气很暖和。

Asuka smiled without looking up. "Looks like we need to turn another 4 degrees to port so that we can make the turn into the canal. Can you relay that to the others, for me, Pinchie?"  
明日香没有抬头就笑了。“看来我们需要再向左转 4 度，以便进入运河。你能帮我转告其他人吗，Pinchie？”

Pinchie, that's a good one. He chuckled and ducked under the door frame that lead below decks, picking up the microphone as he did so. "All stations, this net, this is "John B", be advised we are turning 0-4 degrees port in preparation for follow-on turn into Suez Canal, how copy, over?" He loved sounding official over the radio. It took a little getting used to, and you had to stop and think about what you wanted to say and translate it into radio jargon. It helped to mitigate his accent though.  
Pinchie，这名字不错。他轻笑一声，低头穿过通往甲板下的门框，拿起麦克风说道：“各站注意，这里是‘约翰 B’，请注意我们将向左转 0-4 度，为进入苏伊士运河做准备，收到请回复，完毕。”他喜欢在无线电里显得正式。这需要一点时间适应，而且你必须停下来思考你想说的话，并将其转换成无线电术语。尽管如此，这有助于减少他的口音。

"John B, Manticora, here. Good copy, over."  
“约翰 B，这里是曼提科拉，收到，完毕。”

"Let's Get Naughty-cal, here, we got a good copy, over."  
"让我们开始调皮一点，这里，信号良好，完毕。"

"Petit, good copy, John B, are we going to have any problems getting through the canal, over?"  
"小巧，信号良好，约翰 B，通过运河会有什么问题吗，完毕？"

"Only one tough spot, Petit, but we can stop and moor to take care of it, break." Shinji keyed off the mike, then resumed, "A single gate is stuck partially open, we'll have to open it a bit further, over."  
"只有一个难关，小巧，但我们可以停船并系泊来解决，中断。" 真嗣松开麦克风，然后继续说，"有一扇门卡住了，半开着，我们得把它再打开一些，完毕。"

"John B, Petit, copy over."  
"约翰·B，小皮，复制完毕。"

Shinji turned the wheel ever so slightly, pulling the bow of the ship to port, then settled it back to center. They would be about a half mile out when they made their turn into the canal. Once the cleared the canal inlet, it would be slow going. The wind was west to east, and the banks of the canal tended to act as a wind break. Fortunately, they were not in any hurry.  
真嗣轻轻转动方向盘，将船首向左舷拉去，随后又稳稳地回到中心。当他们转向运河时，大约会离岸半英里。一旦穿过运河入口，行进速度就会慢下来。风从西向东吹，而运河两岸往往会起到风障的作用。幸运的是，他们并不着急。

"Alright, well, we have a couple hours to kill before the next excitement. Anyone got any ideas?" Asuka asked, her boredom evident.  
"好吧，我们还有几个小时才能迎来下一次刺激。谁有什么主意吗？" 明日香问道，她的无聊显而易见。

"Why don't you two head below? Have a little time to yourself." Fenna offered, giving Asuka the flashing eyebrows, to which Asuka responded with frantic waves and head shakes.  
“你们俩为什么不下去呢？享受一下自己的时间。”芬娜提议道，向明日香眨了眨眼，明日香则慌忙地摆手摇头回应。

Shinji blushed beet red and turned to look at the water effecting deafness.  
真嗣的脸红得像甜菜根一样，转头望向水面，假装听不见。

A little over two hours later, Shinji radioed the other boats to prepare to turn into the canal inlet. Without waiting for acknowledgement, James, who had taken the helm, started tuning them starboard to 180 and with only the water lapping at the hull for accompaniment, they glided into the canal.  
两个多小时后，真嗣用无线电通知其他船只准备进入运河入口。不等回应，掌舵的詹姆斯便开始将船转向右舷 180 度，伴随着船体旁轻轻拍打的浪花，他们滑入了运河。

The sides of the canal were sloped sand with occasional mooring points. They passed under several bridges, but these were easily high enough for the four ships to pass under with no alarm. Ahead, Shinji spotted the troublesome gate. It was still partially open, but appeared to have closed a little more than how they had left it. With more people power this time, they were sure to be able to open it fully.  
运河两侧是倾斜的沙岸，偶尔设有系船点。他们穿过了几座桥，但这些桥都足够高，四艘船轻松通过，未引起任何惊慌。前方，真嗣发现了那扇麻烦的闸门。它仍部分开启，但似乎比他们离开时又关上了一些。这次有了更多的人力，他们确信能够完全打开它。

Shinji radioed back and let the other ships know that they were stopping for the time being. About a quarter mile from the gate, the dropped sails, and James ran a mooring line over to a tie-off on the shore, then caught the other line that Shinji threw to him and tied that one as well.  
真嗣用无线电通知其他船只，他们暂时停下。距离闸门约四分之一英里处，他们降下帆，詹姆斯将系船索抛向岸边的系缆桩，然后接住真嗣扔来的另一根绳索并将其系好。

About a half hour later, everyone was back on land, trekking to the machine house that adjoined the stalled gate. The ratchet that Shinji had used just weeks ago to open the gate had broken and was now lying useless in the shadow of the building.  
大约半小时后，所有人都回到了陆地上，向连接着停滞闸门的机械房进发。真嗣几周前用来开启闸门的棘轮已经损坏，如今无用地躺在建筑的阴影中。

James, John and Klaus went inside to take a look at the mechanism that drove the doors. It was an electric motor that would turn a large gear that turned several others to transfer power to both doors. With no electricity, they could not make the motor run, but with all of the people, they would have enough torque to pull the gear around and open the doors. John, Inez and Shahla went back to the Petit and retrieved a power drill, a portable generator, a welding rig and some rebar. While they were out, Klaus set to work removing the drive mechanism from the motor and releasing the gate from it.  
詹姆斯、约翰和克劳斯走进去查看驱动门的机械装置。那是一个电动马达，通过转动一个大齿轮带动其他几个齿轮，将动力传递给两扇门。由于没有电力，他们无法让马达运转，但凭借众人的力量，他们足以转动齿轮打开门。约翰、伊内兹和沙赫拉回到小屋，取回了一个电钻、一个便携式发电机、一套焊接设备和一些钢筋。在他们外出期间，克劳斯开始拆卸马达的驱动装置，并释放了门闸。

In about an hour, John and Inez, who had been learning everything he knew about metal working (a not insubstantial amount of knowledge either), and fashioned a ten foot long handle to the gear with a reinforcing bar on the front side.  
大约一个小时后，约翰和伊内兹（他们一直在学习他所知道的关于金属加工的一切，这方面的知识相当丰富）用一根加固钢筋制作了一个十英尺长的手柄，固定在齿轮上。

"Alright, let's get five people on each side. Front side pulls, back side pushes. Don't push or pull as hard as you can to start either. Start slow, and apply pressure gradually. If you feel the rebar bending, let go." Klaus went over to the gear and shot some light oil at it from an oil can, and did the same down the hinges on the near side. The far side would have to go without.  
“好，每边五个人。前面的人拉，后面的人推。开始时不要用全力，慢慢来，逐渐加力。如果感觉到钢筋弯曲，就放手。”克劳斯走到设备旁，用油壶向上面喷了一些轻油，又在近侧的铰链上做了同样处理。远侧的只能将就了。

With Shinji, John, Mikhail, Sameer and Abdou on the backside pushing, and Shahla, Phuong, Cassandra, Fenna and Bianca on the front side, they began. At first, nothing happened. The men pushed, the women pulled, then a loud creaking shudder issued from the doors and they began to very slowly move apart. Then, very suddenly, a loud bang and something gave way, and the bar leaped forward, causing a tumbling cursing mess. Shinji was afraid that they had broken the bar off of the gear where it had been welded, but then he saw James and Klaus pushing on it one-handed, and the doors were opening easily.  
申吉、约翰、米哈伊尔、萨米尔和阿布杜在后面推，沙拉、芙翁、卡桑德拉、芬娜和比安卡在前面拉，他们开始了。起初，什么也没发生。男人们推，女人们拉，接着门发出一声刺耳的嘎吱声，开始缓缓分开。然后，突然间，一声巨响，有什么东西松动了，钢筋猛地向前一跳，引起一阵混乱和咒骂。申吉担心他们把焊接在齿轮上的钢筋弄断了，但随后他看到詹姆斯和克劳斯单手推着它，门轻松地打开了。

Inez laughed at the amount of sand that John had in his hair. Phuong helped Cassie up and brushed her off, Bianca and Fenna were pushing each other down, and then James bumped the push bar with his butt and another wailing groan issued from the gate and they were all laughing,  
伊内兹看到约翰头发里的沙子，忍不住笑出声来。芙翁帮卡西站起来，拍掉她身上的沙粒，比安卡和芬娜互相推搡着倒下，接着詹姆斯用屁股撞了一下推杆，大门再次发出哀嚎，所有人都笑了起来，

Another hour later, they had gotten the equipment, and reclaimed rebar, back on board and were underway again. Shinji estimated that they would have another 4 hours of daylight. With some luck they would be able to make it to the Great Bitter Lake before sundown. They could anchor, lash the boats, and have a bite to eat and rest, then start the last leg of the canal tomorrow morning.  
又过了一个小时，他们把设备和回收的钢筋重新装上船，再次启航。真嗣估计他们还有四个小时的日光时间。如果运气好的话，他们能在日落前抵达大苦湖。他们可以抛锚，绑好船只，吃点东西休息一下，然后明天早上开始运河的最后一段旅程。

Since the kitchen on "Naughty-cal" was so much better appointed than the others, they would cook and eat dinner on that ship, then return to their own ships after they wound down for the night.  
由于“顽皮号”上的厨房比其他船只配备得更好，他们决定在那艘船上做饭并享用晚餐，然后在夜晚放松后返回各自的船上。

Before leaving Italy, they had come across some cattle that had been grazing in a pasture not far from the road. Megumi, no stranger to farm animals, had tried to convince them to stop. They had actually been on the outskirts of Taranto but were still without a way to preserve anything she would get from the cows. Once they had secured the two solar yachts however, she had returned to the field along with a couple of the other ladies. They had come back with several large stainless steel milk cans filled with fresh milk as well as some eggs collected from some back-yard chickens. They were also covered in blood, and had a butchered cow wrapped in some paper they had found. Shinji had been astounded upon seeing these ladies up to their elbows in blood. But their activities that day had made this evening meal of homemade beef and cheese ravioli.  
离开意大利之前，他们在离公路不远的一片牧场上遇到了一些正在吃草的牛。对于农场动物并不陌生的惠美试图说服他们停下来。他们实际上已经到了塔兰托的郊区，但仍然没有找到保存她能从牛身上获取的东西的方法。然而，一旦他们确保了两艘太阳能游艇的安全，惠美就和几位女士一起回到了那片牧场。她们带回了几个装满新鲜牛奶的大不锈钢奶罐，还有从后院鸡舍收集的鸡蛋。她们浑身是血，还用找到的纸包着一头宰杀好的牛。真嗣看到这些女士们满手是血的样子感到非常惊讶。但她们那天的工作让今晚的晚餐有了一顿自制的牛肉芝士馅饺子。

With separated milk, they could make cheese (ricotta in this case) and butter and with the beef, they had 250 kilograms of beef sitting in a large walk-in cooler. That would go a long way, even with 22 people. The eggs wouldn't last so long unless they were used in things like pasta and breads, but that was alright. Between the other stuff and the rations they had packed, they had more than enough to eat.  
分离出的牛奶可以用来制作奶酪（比如里科塔奶酪）和黄油，而牛肉则有 250 公斤，存放在一个大型的步入式冷藏室里。即便有 22 个人，这些牛肉也足够吃上一段时间。鸡蛋虽然不能保存太久，除非用于制作面食和面包，但这也没关系。除了其他物资和携带的口粮，他们的食物绰绰有余。

After dinner, everyone was stuffed and content. The wind picked up a little bit and it started getting a little cooler. Mikhail pulled out his guitar, recently liberated from a music store in Taranto, and started plucking a few songs he knew. They had all heard him play, and he was not so good he didn't make mistakes, but this was live personal music. He would play some Metallica, then some Willie Nelson, then switch gears and play something more obscure like Puppet Factory, and then he would be back on Led Zeppelin. A few people knew words to some of his songs. He took a few requests, some of which he knew, some of which he improvised.  
晚餐后，大家都吃得饱饱的，心满意足。风稍微大了些，气温也开始下降。米哈伊尔拿出他从塔兰托一家乐器店解救出来的吉他，开始弹奏他熟悉的曲子。他们都已经听过他演奏，虽然他并非完美无瑕，但这种现场的个人音乐却别有一番风味。他会弹一些 Metallica 的曲子，然后是 Willie Nelson 的，接着切换风格，弹一些像 Puppet Factory 这样较为冷门的曲目，随后又回到 Led Zeppelin。有几个人知道他弹奏的一些歌曲的歌词。他接受了一些点歌请求，有些他会弹，有些则即兴发挥。

They sat there for 2 hours singing in the dark Great Bitter Lake, their voices rising into the night. The last few songs were sad ones, Man of Constant Sorrow, a traditional Russian song that he wouldn't talk about, and finally Unchained Melody. Hearing the way he played the last song, Asuka was certain there was someone that Mikhail had left behind when he had been volunteered. She was glad that he was here, but sorry that he was here incomplete.  
他们在黑暗的大苦湖畔坐了两个小时，歌声在夜空中飘扬。最后几首歌颇为哀伤，有《永恒的忧伤人》，一首他不愿提及的传统俄罗斯歌曲，最后是《人鬼情未了》。听着他演奏最后一首歌的方式，明日香确信米哈伊尔在自愿加入之前一定留下了某个人。她很高兴他在这里，但又为他不完整的存在感到遗憾。

On that somber note, they headed back to their own ships. Shinji stayed for a few minutes, and gave Mikhail a pat on the back and talked to him in private. Asuka watched as Mikhail nodded a few times, smiled and shook Shinji's hand. Shinji the comforter. If there were someone who needed comforting, Shinji seemed like he would be in, but he had become stalwart and conscious of other's needs.  
在这种忧郁的氛围中，他们返回各自的船上。真嗣多留了几分钟，拍了拍米哈伊尔的背，私下与他交谈。明日香看着米哈伊尔几次点头，微笑着与真嗣握手。真嗣这位安慰者。如果有谁需要安慰，真嗣似乎总能适时出现，但他已变得坚定且关注他人的需求。

When he came aboard, they sat out and watched the stars talking for a while. It was nice out here with no electronics to distract them, or obligations to get in their way. They held hands, fingers interlaced loosely.  
当他上船后，他们坐下仰望星空，聊了一会儿。在这里，没有电子设备分散注意力，也没有义务妨碍他们，感觉很美好。他们手牵手，手指轻轻交缠。

Shinji ran a finger of his free hand over the ring he had given her. It seemed a long time ago, and he loved that she wore it always. In that way it was a lot like a wedding ring, and they both thought of themselves as married, although when that change in status had happened for either of them, they did not know. Nor did they care. It bore no relevance on them or their circumstances.  
真嗣用空着的那只手的手指轻轻摩挲着她戴着的戒指，那枚他送给她的戒指。仿佛已是许久以前的事了，他喜欢她总是戴着它。这样看来，它很像一枚婚戒，他们俩都觉得自己已经结婚了，尽管谁也不知道这种身份的转变何时发生。他们也不在乎。这和他们的情况无关。

Shinji pulled her hand up and kissed the ring, then leaned close and kissed her. When the kiss broke, she nuzzled him with her nose. That was the sign that it was time to go below. This would be the last night they would have where the boats would be fully quiet and dark. After they exited the canal tomorrow, they would start keeping shifts to continue sailing through the night. While it was a bit dangerous to sail out here with no light at night, the canal being such close quarters, the same could not be said for the open ocean. If they sailed without stopping they would likely take a little less than a month to reach Okayama. With occasional stops to crossload food or supplies or just be with other people, they could look at it being 30 to 34 days.  
真嗣拉起她的手，亲吻了戒指，然后靠近她，亲吻了她。当这个吻结束时，她用鼻子蹭了蹭他。这是该下船的信号。这将是他们最后一次在船只完全安静和黑暗的情况下度过的夜晚。明天离开运河后，他们将开始轮班，继续夜间航行。虽然在这里夜间无光航行有些危险，运河空间狭小，但开阔的海洋则不然。如果他们不停歇地航行，到达冈山可能需要不到一个月的时间。偶尔停靠以转运食物或补给，或只是与其他人相处，他们可以预计大约 30 到 34 天。

Shinji based this on a nominal average speed of 13 knots throughout the voyage. That is about what they made on the way over. They might actually make a little better speed if they could pick up the currents flowing past the tip of India and past Malaysia. That night they slept deeply and restfully, but only after playing around.  
真嗣根据整个航程中名义上的平均速度 13 节来计算。这大约是他们来时的速度。如果他们能利用流经印度尖端和马来西亚附近的海流，实际速度可能会更快一些。那晚他们深沉而安稳地睡去，但只是在玩耍之后。

10 days later, as the ships were passing within 100 miles of the southern tip of India, Danysa, who was on watch on "Manticora" radioed that she had just seen a whale breaching off to port. Without answering her message, Asuka on "Sloop John B", Mikhail on "Petit" and Amelie on "Let's Get Naughty-cal" called the crews on their ships to watch.  
10 天后，当船只距离印度南端 100 英里时，丹妮莎在“曼提科拉”号上值班，通过无线电报告说她刚刚看到左舷外有一头鲸鱼跃出水面。没有回复她的消息，“约翰 B 号”上的明日香、“小巧号”上的米哈伊尔和“让我们放纵号”上的阿梅莉亚分别召集各自船员观看。

In the next hour, the ships had moved further from land, and closer to the whales to watch them. Wei, who was learning English at an astounding rate, identified them as humpback whales. Every few moments, one would shoot out of the water nose first, then turn in the air with their tail still in the water and come crashing down on their backs. Sometimes two or three wales would breach at nearly the same time offering a fantastic display of power.  
接下来的一个小时里，船只远离了陆地，更接近了鲸鱼以便观赏。正在以惊人速度学习英语的魏，辨认出它们是座头鲸。每隔一会儿，就会有一头鲸鱼先从水中冲出鼻尖，然后在空中转身，尾巴仍留在水中，重重地摔在背上。有时两三头鲸鱼几乎同时跃出水面，展现出惊人的力量。

Asuka gasped as a large whale surfaced not 50 meters from the "John B", blowing a spray of water high into the air. It was easily keeping pace with the boat and it would occasionally break the surface and she could see that it was looking at them. She wondered if it was trying to figure out why it hadn't seen many ships lately. Maybe it was relieved that it was no longer hunted. Maybe it was just inquisitive.  
明日香倒吸一口凉气，一头巨大的鲸鱼在距离“约翰·B”号不到 50 米的地方浮出水面，喷出一股高高的水柱。它轻松地与船并驾齐驱，不时破浪而出，她能看到它在注视着他们。她想知道它是否在试图弄清楚为什么最近没见到多少船只。也许它对不再被猎杀感到欣慰。也许它只是好奇。

She wondered briefly how much intelligence would have been necessary to have made someone susceptible to the Anti A.T. Field that swept the globe releasing souls en masse. Where any of the other high order mammals gone? The question bothered her, and she hoped that humans had been the only ones caught up in the effect. That they would do this to themselves was bad enough, but to have roped in animals that had no dealings in their existence and likely would rather just be left along? That was a crime against Nature.  
她短暂地思考了一下，需要多少智慧才能让人容易受到全球范围内释放灵魂的大规模反 A.T.力场的影响。其他高等哺乳动物都消失了吗？这个问题困扰着她，她希望只有人类受到了这种影响。人类自己造成的灾难已经够糟糕了，如果还牵连到那些与他们的存在无关、可能只是希望被放过的动物，那简直就是对大自然的犯罪。

The whales hung around for another half hour before veering off to stay in their feeding ground. By this point the ships were closing on Sri Lanka and would have to navigate around it. Maybe the krill was especially good back behind them.  
鲸鱼又逗留了半小时，然后转向它们的觅食区。此时，船只正逼近斯里兰卡，必须绕行。也许它们身后的磷虾特别美味。

The brief interlude gave them a new topic of conversation both in person, and over the radio. It was good that animals had been largely unaffected by Third Impact. Not long after awaking on the beach, she had wondered if there were any animal left. If so, how many? Few? Most? All? Animals shut in houses and cages, they were victims also weren't they? A new flash of anger at the old men of Seele, and to Shinji's father as well. He was just as much to blame.  
短暂的间歇为他们提供了新的话题，无论是面对面还是通过无线电交流。幸运的是，动物在第三次冲击中大多未受影响。醒来不久在海滩上，她曾疑惑是否还有动物存活。如果有，又有多少？少数？多数？全部？那些被关在房屋和笼子里的动物，它们也是受害者，不是吗？她对 Seele 的老人们以及真嗣的父亲再次感到愤怒。他同样难辞其咎。

By catching good winds and staying in currents moving their direction they made good time for the rest of the trip, although there were no other whale sightings or other incidents to break up the time. Some of the group members were getting restless, and there were a couple of shouting confrontations that were broken up on "Naughty-cal" and "Manticora". These were brought under control without incident, and the parties involved were quick to apologize after they were given time to cool down.  
借助有利的风向并保持在向他们方向流动的海流中，他们剩余的航程进展顺利，尽管没有其他鲸鱼目击事件或其他事件来打破这段时光。一些团队成员开始感到不安，发生了几次在“Naughty-cal”和“Manticora”上的争吵，但都被及时制止，没有发生意外。涉事双方在冷静下来后也迅速道歉。

They passed Kuala Lumpur about 5 days after the whales. Shinji had been on watch, then and alerted the other ships to the city. They were far enough away that they could not see the city proper, however.  
他们在见到鲸鱼后的第五天经过了吉隆坡。当时是真嗣在值守，他向其他船只报告了这座城市的位置。但由于距离较远，他们无法看清城市的全貌。

After leaving the Singapore Strait at the southern end of the Malaysian Peninsula, and passing the Palua islands just to the east of there, they turned for Japan. It would be nearly 3000 miles going on that same heading, and so shifts were changed to 4 hour shifts to keep people fresh. The larger boats had it a little easier as they had more people to draw from, but the smaller ones made do well enough. At about 4:00 PM local Japan time, on their 31st day at sea, they passed Tanegashima, and everyone, save for Shinji, Asuka and Megumi, got their first look at Japan. There were bright beaches and dark forests, and behind them, farms, mountains.  
离开马来西亚半岛南端的新加坡海峡后，途经东侧的帕卢亚群岛，他们转向前往日本。沿着这条航线，行程将近 3000 英里，因此轮班时间调整为 4 小时一班，以保持人员精力充沛。较大的船只因人手较多而稍显轻松，但较小的船只也应对得当。当地时间下午 4 点左右，海上第 31 天，他们驶过种子岛，除了真嗣、明日香和惠美外，所有人都首次目睹了日本的景象。那里有明亮的沙滩、深邃的森林，背后则是农田与山峦。

No one spoke for a while. They knew now that they were in the last leg of the journey. Soon, they could start the business of living. They could put down roots, establish a small community and try to regain society. Interestingly, while everyone had thought about what this meant, no one had spoken of it. Even now, at the end of the world, sexual taboos were still self-enforced. They knew that if any of them were to do their part in ensuring the continuance of mankind for the next generation, they would need to have children. Not only that, but they would only have to pool of the opposite sex represented here to choose from, and love may very well not have much play in it. While men may want to portray the image that they will have sex with anything that is willing, and some do, most really only want someone to love, and the same goes for women.  
一时间无人开口。他们明白，旅程已至尾声。不久，他们将开始生活的经营。可以扎根，建立小社群，尝试重建社会。有趣的是，尽管每个人都思考过这意味着什么，却无人提及。即便在世界尽头，性禁忌依旧自我约束。他们清楚，若要确保人类为下一代延续，他们需繁衍后代。不仅如此，可供选择的异性仅限于此地，而爱情在其中或许无足轻重。尽管男性可能想展现自己愿意与任何愿意者发生关系，有些人确实如此，但多数人其实只渴望被爱，女性亦然。

It had not gone unnoticed that there were more women than men, either. It might be required that some taboos either be thrown to the wind, or circumvented in the interest of the species. If polyamorous relationships continued to be viewed the way they had in the past, perhaps in vitro fertilization would be an option, assuming they could accomplish it. Whatever the case, the well though, but seldom spoken fact was, that there would need to be new batches of children over the horizon for as many of them as could be mustered.  
同样显而易见的是，女性人数多于男性。或许某些禁忌要么被抛诸脑后，要么为了种族利益而绕道而行。如果多角恋关系仍如过去那般被看待，或许体外受精会成为一种选择，前提是他们能实现这一技术。无论如何，一个被深思熟虑却鲜少提及的事实是，为了尽可能多的人，未来需要不断有新一批的孩子诞生。

About 20 hours later, the four ships were in sight of Okayama harbor. The "John B" and "Petit" both struck their sales and started their engines, while "Manticora" and "Let's Get Naughty-cal" cut power and drifted. It was noon, and the harbor had not been ready for the arrival of the three other sizeable ships, so after a short celebration after making land-fall, they got to work, moving boats from the nearest usable slips that would accommodate the larger vessels. With the ships safely moored, they decided to take a rest, regroup and figure out what would be done next.  
大约 20 小时后，四艘船只出现在冈山港的视野中。“约翰 B”号和“小巧”号都收起了帆并启动了引擎，而“曼提科拉”号和“让我们放纵号”则关闭了动力，随波漂流。正值正午，港口并未准备好迎接另外三艘大型船只的到来，因此在短暂庆祝登陆后，他们开始忙碌起来，将附近可用泊位上的船只移开，以便容纳更大的船只。待船只安全停泊后，他们决定稍作休息，重新集结并商讨接下来的行动。

Shinji took several people including Klaus in a small truck to look for more vehicles. They would need them. With a total of 12 vehicles in operable condition (every one of them needed their fuel tanks partially drained to remove the water and saturated ethanol) they had enough to get everyone around in relative comfort.  
真嗣带着包括克劳斯在内的几个人乘坐一辆小卡车去寻找更多车辆。他们需要这些。总共有 12 辆车处于可操作状态（每辆车都需要部分排空油箱以去除水分和饱和乙醇），这足以让每个人相对舒适地出行。

They took their last meal as the travelling group in the street outside the marina. Arguments that had arisen on the ships (that had not turned to shouts) were forgiven, and the music that Mikhail and his increasingly talented protégé Nazli, who had been learning the guitar with him since the Suez Canal, played for them was uplifting and fun. Several couples formed for dancing, but only three were romantically involved. Shinji and Asuka danced as best they could, neither having really danced before, especially with someone. James and Fenna were also together as well as John and Linda, and these groups were more graceful and accomplished at least in the art of dancing.  
他们在码头外的街道上吃了最后一顿作为旅行团的饭。船上发生的争执（未演变成争吵）被原谅了，米哈伊尔和他越来越有才华的徒弟纳兹莉为他们演奏的音乐令人振奋且有趣。纳兹莉自从苏伊士运河以来就一直和他学习吉他。几对舞伴形成了，但只有三对是浪漫关系。真嗣和明日香尽可能地跳舞，两人都没有真正跳过舞，尤其是和别人一起。詹姆斯和芬娜，约翰和琳达也在其中，这些组合至少在跳舞艺术上更为优雅和熟练。

One last night on the boats. Shinji and Asuka were both grateful to be home, and really, that is what it was wasn't it? This is where they had established themselves, it is where they had fallen in love, they had wept together and loved together, and found peace from their pasts together here. Late that night, or maybe even early the next morning, Asuka quietly woke Shinji up and gave him the shush, then she waited. There it was again. Someone out there was having sex, and it sounded like both were enjoying it mightily.  
在船上的最后一夜。真嗣和明日香都庆幸能回到家中，这确实是他们的家，不是吗？这里见证了他们的安顿，他们的相爱，他们共同哭泣与欢笑，在这里找到了从过去解脱的宁静。深夜，或许是凌晨时分，明日香轻轻唤醒了真嗣，示意他安静，然后等待着。又来了，外面有人在亲热，听起来双方都乐在其中。

Shinji smiled and shook his head, but before he could turn over and go back to sleep, Asuka took his face in her hands, and kissed him firmly, allowing her tongue to quietly tell him what she was about. His arms snaked around her back and holding her buttocks, he rolled fully onto his back, and moved her on top of him in the same move. They both tried to keep their sounds to a minimum, and thought they had largely succeeded, but other parties heard, and as if answering a call, began their own lovemaking in response.  
真嗣微笑着摇了摇头，但还没等他翻身继续入睡，明日香双手捧住他的脸颊，坚定地吻了他，用舌尖悄悄传达她的意图。他的手臂环抱住她的背部，同时托住她的臀部，翻身仰躺，顺势将她移到自己上方。两人都尽量压低声音，自以为做得不错，但其他人还是听到了，仿佛回应召唤，也开始了自己的爱意表达。

### Chapter 19 Community

This chapter has a long meeting that is broken up into two parts. The problem with explanation and planning in stories such as these is if you have too much all in one spot, it becomes boring, and frankly it reads kind of like Deus Ex Machina, like the hand of the writer is coming down to move pieces conveniently into position to create the least amount of difficulty. I might be doing that, I don't know. But to make it a little less boring, I broke it up and put some people doing something in between.  
这个chapter会议冗长，分为两部分。这类故事中解释和规划的问题在于，如果一次性堆砌过多，会变得乏味，坦白说，读起来有点像机械降神，仿佛作者之手在方便地移动棋子，以制造最少的困难。我可能正在这样做，我不确定。但为了不那么枯燥，我将其拆分，并在其间穿插了一些人物的活动。

I have actually given a lot of thought to managing a post apocalyptic scenario given differing levels of societal and infrastructure breakdown. As a thought experiment it is fun and challenging to figure out how much you can get out of the situation without overexerting yourself or missing things that you might need later for your survival. Anyhow, on with the story, eh?  
我确实花了很多心思去设想在社会和基础设施不同程度崩溃后的末日情景下如何管理。作为一个思维实验，它既有趣又具挑战性，要弄清楚在不过度劳累或遗漏可能日后生存所需之物的情况下，你能从这种境况中获得多少。无论如何，继续讲故事吧，嗯？

---

Many people have theorized that given a relatively intact civilized infrastructure, a small number of survivors could live fairly easily on the leavings of the old civilization for quite a long time, during which, they could begin making strides to regain their previous autonomy. Stores of non-perishable goods, fabric and clothing, raw materials and even recyclables would be about in abundance, and without need to purchase these items, the survivors might appropriate them. Maintaining these things would be the difficulty.  
许多人推测，在相对完好的文明基础设施下，一小群幸存者可以相当长时间内依靠旧文明的遗留物相对轻松地生活，在此期间，他们可以开始努力恢复以前的自主权。非易腐货物、布料和衣物、原材料甚至可回收物品都会大量存在，而且由于无需购买这些物品，幸存者可能会直接取用。维护这些东西将是难点所在。

One would need both the knowledge and the facilities to produce the repair parts or fuel. Then one would need the knowledge and facilities to repair the facilities. If enough industry was leftover from the fallen civilization, and one had the knowledge either at hand or available to learn, then they could conceivably sustain themselves indefinitely. If one were to take proactive steps to gather and produce the precursors in abundance, they could do more than sustain, they could flourish.  
要生产修理零件或燃料，既需要知识也需要设施。接着，还需要知识和设施来修复这些设施。如果衰落文明留下的工业基础足够，且手头有现成的知识或可学到的知识，那么他们理论上可以无限期地维持下去。如果采取积极措施大量收集和生产前驱物质，他们不仅能维持生存，还能繁荣发展。

Shinji knew that a lot of hard work lay ahead of them. He figured that it would take everyone working at their hardest for the first few years to reach a state of sustainability. Despite this, the newly founded community rested for a couple of weeks after the initial push to occupy the area. Homes needed to be inspected, roads needed to be cleared, a lot of growth needed to be cut and removed. The stored goods on the boats were loaded into steel intermodal containers which were moved via picker to the outskirts of town nearer to the homes.  
真嗣知道他们面前有很多艰苦的工作。他估计，最初几年需要大家全力以赴才能达到可持续状态。尽管如此，在最初占领区域的努力之后，新建立的社区还是休息了几周。需要检查房屋，清理道路，大量植被需要砍伐和移除。船上储存的货物被装入钢制集装箱，通过拣选机运送到靠近住宅区的城镇边缘。

All told the 22 new residents took up ten homes. Three couples were living together, and the rest were content to live in gender groups of two or three. This ended up being all to the good; Shinji had heard anecdotal evidence from several people that larger groups and mixed gendered groups that were not in a relationship always spawned drama.  
总共 22 位新居民占据了十栋房屋。三对情侣选择同住，其余的则满足于按性别分成两到三人的小组。这最终证明是件好事；真嗣从几个人那里听说过一些轶事，表明更大的群体和非恋爱关系的混合性别群体总会引发戏剧性事件。

**Meeting – Part 1 (04 August 01 NE)  
会议 – 第一部分（01 NE 年 8 月 4 日）**

After letting people settle for a couple of days, they all met at the Ikari house, as it had become known, to discuss courses of action for the way ahead. Over the next few hours, and through two meals, they came to a consensus over immediate, secondary and follow-on needs and courses of action that could be carried out.  
在让人们安顿了几天后，他们全体在被称为“碇家”的房子里集合，讨论未来的行动方针。在接下来的几个小时里，经过两顿饭的时间，他们就立即、次要和后续的需求及可采取的行动达成了一致。

First and foremost, they needed to consolidate resources. Teams would be created to scour the area in a widening net to find and return with anything on a short list of useful items and technology: seeds, fertilizers, soil treatments, agricultural implements, vehicles, metal working machinery and gear, tools, lumber, non-perishable food items, raw materials.  
首要任务是整合资源。将组建团队，以扩大的网状方式搜索该区域，寻找并带回一份简短的有用物品和技术清单上的任何东西：种子、肥料、土壤处理剂、农业工具、车辆、金属加工机械和齿轮、工具、木材、不易腐烂的食品和原材料。

These items would need to be stored safely, so while teams were locating and bringing these items back, another team would be busy preparing a site and bringing in more of the steel containers from the dock. For the time being, Abdou advocated the use of at least two dozen such containers. They were large, but would fill up fast. While the procurement operation continued, Sameer and the site storage team would start construction on a large warehouse and workshop. Shinji was certain he had seen a construction company in town that advertised steel buildings. All of this construction would need a bit of prepping. Concrete mixing, gravel for the site, vehicles for the procuring teams and the like.  
这些物品需要安全储存，因此当团队在定位并带回这些物品时，另一团队将忙于准备场地并从码头运来更多钢制集装箱。目前，Abdou 主张至少使用两打这样的集装箱。它们虽然体积庞大，但很快就会装满。在采购行动继续进行的同时，Sameer 和场地储存团队将开始建造一个大仓库和车间。Shinji 确信他在镇上看到过一家宣传钢结构建筑的建筑公司。所有这些建设都需要一些前期准备。混凝土搅拌、场地所需的碎石、采购团队的交通工具等等。

The meeting took place on August 4th of what was quickly becoming known as year 02 of the new era and what would have been known as 2017 otherwise. They spent another week getting their homes in order. It was decided that to keep people fed during procurement time, they would eat as a group for breakfast and dinner which would take place before and after dark respectively. Daylight would be reserved for work since it was now waning, and soon they would have short days.  
会议于新纪元 02 年 8 月 4 日举行，若非如此，本应是 2017 年。他们又花了一周时间整理家园。为了在采购期间确保人们有饭吃，他们决定集体用餐，早餐和晚餐分别在日落前和日落后进行。由于白昼渐短，日间将专门用于工作，不久他们将迎来短暂的冬日。

---

John, Sameer, Shahla and Inez stood at the site that had been chosen as the central collection point. Five of the ten homes that they now occupied plus the Ikari house were within a mile of this spot, and the road was paved. The balding hill needed 14 trees felled as well as some leveling work and ground brush clearing. The work would be warm, but it would not take long with the four of them and the equipment that they had brought with them.  
约翰、萨米尔、莎赫拉和伊内斯站在选定的中央收集点。他们现在居住的十栋房屋中有五栋以及碇家都在一英里范围内，道路是铺好的。这座光秃的小山需要砍伐 14 棵树，并进行一些平整工作和地面灌木清理。工作虽会让人感到温暖，但凭借他们四人和带来的设备，不会耗时太久。

During the rest of that first day, Inez felled the trees which were then stacked to the side for use later on. The stumps were pulled with the grader, which went on to scrape all of the greenery off of the hilltop. The dump truck full of gravel that had been driven up there the previous day deposited its load, and the grader went back to work leveling and spreading the gravel. This area, which lay to the right of the entrance to the clearing, would have the containers sitting in it by the end of the next day.  
在第一天剩下的时间里，伊内兹砍倒了树木，随后这些树被堆放在一旁以备后用。树桩用推土机拔除，接着推土机继续刮除山顶上的所有绿色植被。前一天开上来的满载碎石的卡车卸下了货物，推土机再次开始工作，平整并铺开碎石。这片位于空地入口右侧的区域，将在第二天结束时放置好集装箱。

The late afternoon light cast a golden glow about the green forest, and the sound of vehicles coming up the road let the four-person construction detail know that their work was at an end. The vehicles that the procurement teams where driving today would be left at the site, and fresh vehicles would be taken out tomorrow. With the containers in place, the loaded vehicles could be unloaded and readied for the teams use the next day.  
傍晚的阳光为绿林披上一层金辉，车辆驶上道路的声响让这四人施工小组知道他们的工作已告一段落。今天采购团队驾驶的车辆将留在现场，而明天将换上新车。随着集装箱就位，装载的车辆可以卸货并准备供团队次日使用。

Dinner that night was a gigantic helping of chicken Okinawa-soba. The large soba noodles, chunks of chicken, and fresh vegetables found through Shinji's foraging did wonders to revitalize the work crews. Asuka commented on the fact that so many people were in such high spirits, and put it down to performing demanding, but rewarding work, work that would ensure your survival, work that you could be proud of.  
那晚的晚餐是丰盛的冲绳鸡肉荞麦面。宽大的荞麦面条、鸡肉块和真嗣采集的新鲜蔬菜，为工作队带来了极大的活力。明日香评论说，这么多人如此精神饱满，她将其归因于从事既艰苦又有回报的工作，这些工作能确保你的生存，也是你值得骄傲的。

---

The next day, the collection site team had the first dozen containers placed and coupled on the fresh gravel bed. The team next turned to unloading the previous day's trucks. The amount of material stored within was just short of astounding. There were hundreds of bags of concrete, lime, soil, clay breaker, fertilizer, and whole displays of seeds, stacks of pots and sprout trays, stacks of fiberglass and sheet iron, lathes, toolboxes, sanders, grinders, welders, and other items beyond telling.  
第二天，收集点团队在新鲜的碎石床上放置并连接了第一批十几个集装箱。随后，团队开始卸载前一天的卡车。储存的物资数量令人惊叹。有数百袋混凝土、石灰、土壤、粘土破碎剂、肥料，以及各种种子、成堆的盆和发芽托盘、成堆的玻璃纤维和铁皮、车床、工具箱、砂光机、研磨机、焊机等，种类繁多，不胜枚举。

It was evident that they would need someone to help organize the procured items each day, otherwise, the building and other improvements to the site would never get done. They needed to run electricity to the site, pour the slab for the steel building, bring water in from the waterline sitting on the far side of the road; too much to do in addition to storing, sorting and inventorying the material. They unloaded the trucks, but left everything fairly haphazardly in the dozen containers. There were five teams of four people each out there. Each one was tasked with several primary categories of items. Once they brought the vehicles from today's haul in, they would need to reorganize to lose one or two members.  
显然，他们每天都需要有人来帮忙整理采购的物品，否则，建筑和其他场地的改进工作将永远无法完成。他们需要将电力引至现场，为钢结构建筑浇筑地基，从马路对面的水管处引水进来；除了储存、分类和盘点材料外，还有太多事情要做。他们卸下了卡车上的货物，但将所有东西都相当随意地堆放在十几个集装箱里。现场有五个四人小组，每个小组负责几类主要物品。一旦他们将今天的收获车辆运进来，就需要重新组织，减少一两个成员。

"Man, I could get used to working like this." John remarked as they finished up unloading the trucks. Soon they would be on the road back to town to get the cement mixer filled, by hand, and prepped for laying some concrete. The wooden forms for the slab were coming along, and would be ready to accept concrete soon. Sameer had really lived up to his construction background.  
“伙计，我可以习惯这样的工作。”约翰在卸完卡车后说道。很快他们就要返回镇上，手动装满水泥搅拌机，准备浇筑混凝土。木制地模正在制作中，很快就能接受混凝土浇筑。萨米尔确实发挥了他在建筑方面的背景。

"Oh? Why do you say that?" Shahla's English was getting better, and she smiled in knowing this. She had not had to slowly sound out one word in that last sentence.  
"哦？你为何这么说？" Shahla 的英语越来越好了，她对此心知肚明，微笑着。刚才那句话，她没有费力地一个字一个字慢慢读出来。

"I mean that I have worked on construction projects before. Too much bureaucracy. This is the first time where people have been able to finish one thing, and move directly on to the next. No waiting for inspections, forms, signatures, waiting for the boss to come see that everything is progressing, but not too fast." He rolled a large tool chest into the back of a container next to three sets of welding equipment, two MIG welders and an electric welder.  
"我的意思是，我以前参与过建筑项目。太多官僚主义了。这是第一次，人们能够完成一件事，然后直接进入下一件。无需等待检查、表格、签名，也不用等老板来视察进度，既不能太快也不能太慢。" 他将一个大工具箱滚到集装箱后面，旁边是三套焊接设备，包括两台 MIG 焊机和一台电焊机。

With the last of the equipment unloaded, he and Shahla headed over to Sameer and Inez who needed another ten minutes to square up the corners of the new slab form. This would be a pretty large building and would require several truckloads of concrete. It would be a lot of work getting them all loaded and mixed.  
卸下最后一批设备后，他和 Shahla 走向 Sameer 和 Inez，他们还需要十分钟来调整新混凝土板模型的角落。这将是一座相当大的建筑，需要好几卡车的混凝土。装载和搅拌这些混凝土将是一项繁重的工作。

---

At dinner that night John voiced his concerns that they were getting too much too fast, and that the building team would not have time to build. The concrete that was poured that day would be a week in curing, but in the meantime, they would have other things to do, namely running electricity to the site, improving the road, fixing up some drainage, digging septic system and getting water to the site from the main. With all of that going on, they would have their hands full.  
当晚晚餐时，约翰表达了他的担忧，认为他们进展得太快，建筑团队可能没有足够的时间来建造。当天浇筑的混凝土需要一周时间固化，但在此期间，他们还有其他事情要做，比如向工地通电、改善道路、修复排水系统、挖掘化粪池以及从主水源引水到工地。所有这些工作加起来，他们将忙得不可开交。

It was decided that one team would be brought in for organizing and inventory. This would slow down the influx of goods, and at the same time allow a more thoughtful storage process.  
决定引入一个团队负责组织和库存管理。这将减缓物资的涌入速度，同时允许更周到的存储过程。

The medical team also reported that they had located a large amount of laboratory chemicals. They had no way to transport them, and it would be dangerous to store them all together so they were leaving them in place. Perhaps power could be routed there later on so that a makeshift pharmaceutical industry could be started.  
医疗团队还报告说，他们发现了一大批实验室化学品。他们无法运输这些化学品，而且将它们集中存放也很危险，所以暂时留在原地。或许以后可以向那里供电，以便启动一个临时制药产业。

---

A water tanker had been parked next to the large concrete slab that was curing in the warm sunlight. It was slowly trickling water out onto the surface of the concrete, keeping a thin layer of water on it. This moist curing process would ensure a touch hard concrete base, and when it was sealed after a week of curing, it would be ready for building.  
一辆水罐车停放在那块正在温暖阳光下养护的大型混凝土板旁边。它正缓慢地将水滴洒在混凝土表面，保持一层薄薄的水膜。这种湿润养护过程将确保混凝土基底达到一定的硬度，待一周养护密封后，便可用于建筑。

Over the next few days the build team pulled power to the site and were able to stop using generators, they put up a UPS, dug the septic system, laid a tank and field line in. They even got water brought in from the main line by the road through the use of a saddle tap, no water waste needed. The evening before starting to construct the steel building, they staged the crane, members, sheet metal, and other tools and materials for ease of access the following day. They had prepared the concrete for the building, sealing it and smoothing the floor so that it would not absorb any staining substances. Sameer estimated that the construction would likely take two days with the four of them, maybe three at the most.  
接下来的几天里，施工团队将电力引入现场，不再依赖发电机，他们安装了不间断电源，挖掘了化粪池系统，铺设了储罐和田间管道。他们甚至通过道路主管道上的鞍形接头引入了水源，无需浪费水资源。在开始建造钢结构建筑的前一晚，他们安排好了起重机、构件、金属板及其他工具和材料，以便次日轻松取用。他们已经为建筑准备好了混凝土，进行了密封和地面抛光，以防吸收任何染色物质。萨米尔估计，他们四人施工可能需要两天时间，最多不超过三天。

The team that had been brought back for organizing and inventory was hard at work cross-loading inventorying and packing everything that was found. The containers provided a lot of space but were not very well laid out for getting to things easily without sacrificing a lot of that space for walk way. On the second day of the job, Linda had brought a laptop that she had found and began keeping a spreadsheet inventory. After four days of this, Hugo had offered to create a database to hold all of the information about the items, their condition, location in the containers, and other data.  
负责组织和清点的团队被召回后，正忙于交叉清点和打包所有找到的物品。这些集装箱提供了大量空间，但布局并不利于在不牺牲太多空间作为通道的情况下轻松取物。工作第二天，琳达带来了一台她找到的笔记本电脑，开始制作电子表格进行库存管理。四天后，雨果提出创建一个数据库，以存储所有物品的信息，包括它们的状况、在集装箱中的位置及其他数据。

With this computerized system in hand they were able to quantify their intake. On the third day of the buildings construction, they ran had run out of room in several of the first set of containers. John and Inez brought more in.  
有了这个计算机化系统，他们能够量化物资的接收情况。在建筑施工的第三天，他们发现第一批几个集装箱已经没有空间了。约翰和伊内兹又运来了更多集装箱。

**Meeting Part 2 (04 August 01 NE)  
会议第二部分（04 年 8 月 1 日 NE）**

After an hour of discussion and plan making for phase I, the meeting had broken down into several groups telling stories about their experiences that had some tangential relevance to the discussion. Shinji decided to call a break and let everyone stretch, finish their stories, grab a bite to eat, maybe head to the bathroom, and come back fresh in 20 minutes.  
经过一个小时的讨论和制定第一阶段的计划，会议已经分成了几个小组，各自讲述着与讨论有些间接相关经历的故事。真嗣决定叫个暂停，让大家伸展一下，讲完故事，吃点东西，或者去趟洗手间，20 分钟后以崭新的状态回来。

He heard Hugo talking about automation software and how he had made boring and tedious jobs require no human interaction, he listened to John talk about setting up a blacksmith and metal working shop, and all of the things that could be done there, and then just a few feet away, he heard James talking about disassembling unused wind turbines and packing them away instead of leaving them out in the elements. That was a pretty good idea, he'd have to remember that.  
他听到雨果在谈论自动化软件，以及他是如何让那些枯燥乏味的工作不再需要人工干预；他听着约翰讲述建立铁匠铺和金属加工车间的经历，以及在那里可以完成的各种事情；然后就在几英尺外，他听到詹姆斯在谈论拆解未使用的风力涡轮机并将其打包存放，而不是让它们暴露在自然环境中。这主意不错，他得记下来。

After the break, they came back together to discuss immediate developments. Talk moved from agricultural necessities to industrial ones, then to medical ones. How could 24 people provide all of the resources that were needed? And then, how would they provide it after having children? Raising children was demanding work and could not effectively happen while the parents were occupied with other responsibilities. What about teaching?  
休息过后，他们重新聚在一起讨论即刻的发展。话题从农业需求转向工业，再到医疗。24 个人如何能提供所有必需的资源？而有了孩子之后，又该如何继续提供？养育孩子是一项艰巨的工作，父母在忙于其他职责时难以有效兼顾。教育问题又该如何解决？

Shinji reached back to Hugo talking about automation. They had a lot of technology at their disposal. They had most of the means of using and adapting that technology in this room right now. The agricultural question was obviously the most pressing and the easiest to deal with through automation. Hadn't many, perhaps even most, of the farms in industrialized nations turned to automation to cut down on the human workload?  
真嗣回想起雨果提到的自动化。他们手头拥有大量技术资源。利用和适应这些技术的手段，大部分就在这间屋子里。农业问题显然最为紧迫，也是最容易通过自动化解决的。工业化国家的许多农场，甚至可能是大多数，不都转向了自动化以减少人力负担吗？

Then there was the problem of wear and tear on much of the material that was lying unused. Conservation of these items would mean that they could be used later to replace failing and used materials. The deconstruction of un-used homes in a certain radius, the deconstruction of the extra wind turbines from James conversation earlier. These were a few of the things that could be done to prolong the technological advantage that their generation could provide to the future. Eventually, much of the knowledge that was necessary to produce these things might be lost and would have to be rediscovered.  
然后，大量闲置材料的磨损问题亟待解决。对这些物品的保存意味着它们可以在将来替换损坏和老化的材料。拆除一定半径内未使用的房屋，拆除詹姆斯早先谈话中提到的多余风力涡轮机。这些措施可以延长他们这一代技术对未来的优势。最终，制造这些物品所需的大部分知识可能会丢失，必须重新发现。

For the time being, phase II would consist of preparations through the winter for an aggressive automated agriculture campaign to commence in the spring, as well as an ongoing effort to deconstruct for conservation any items that could be without an inordinate amount of work required. This led directly to the last phase that would begin in the spring of next year.  
目前，第二阶段将包括为冬季过后春季开展的积极自动化农业活动做准备，以及持续努力拆除并保存任何不需要过多工作的物品。这将直接引向明年春季开始的最后一个阶段。

Phase III would have to see agricultural returns with only a few people, and likely more come harvest time, and the setting up and operation of small industrial and service oriented endeavors to benefit the community. Amelie and Danysa had already spoken of pharmaceutical production; antibiotics and many other common drugs had a shelf life and required climate control, and thus were no longer good. Likewise, mechanical and electronic repair would be in high demand, so James and Klaus would have lots to do. Clothing and textiles, construction and unforeseeable industries would need to be populated.  
第三阶段必须实现农业回报，只需少数人参与，收获时节可能会有更多人加入，同时建立并运营小型工业和服务导向型事业以造福社区。阿梅莉和达尼萨已经谈及制药生产；抗生素及许多其他常用药物都有保质期，需要温控，因此已不再有效。同样，机械和电子维修需求量很大，所以詹姆斯和克劳斯将有很多工作要做。服装和纺织、建筑以及不可预见的行业也需要有人投身其中。

Unfortunately because of the unknown nature of the problems they would encounter, this would remain a fuzzier plan. Being ready for it was the purpose of the previous phases, however.  
遗憾的是，由于他们将面临的问题性质未知，这一计划仍将较为模糊。前几个阶段的准备正是为了应对这一挑战。

Shinji crawled into bed where Asuka was already laying. Being early October, it was still pretty warm out during the day time, but at night it was getting down to 15 degrees C, and tonight would be no exception. He scooted behind her, and his cool skin touched her much warmer skin, sending goose bumps over both of their bodies.  
真嗣爬上床，阿斯卡已经在那里躺着了。虽然十月初白天依然相当温暖，但夜晚气温已降至 15 摄氏度，今晚也不例外。他挪到她身后，他凉爽的皮肤触碰到她温暖得多的肌肤，两人身上都起了鸡皮疙瘩。

"Hey, you still awake?" Shinji asked in a soft whisper.  
"嘿，你还没睡吗？" 真嗣轻声问道。

"If I had been asleep, your cold legs would have woken me up," she replied giving him a half-hearted elbow.  
"如果我睡着了，你那冰冷的双腿也会把我冻醒的，" 她回答道，半心半意地用胳膊肘顶了他一下。

In reply, Shinji put his equally cold arm around her midsection, snaking it under her arm, and bringing it to rest under her breasts, to which she snorted a short laugh. "Sorry I was out so late tonight. John has gotten his metal shop up and running at the Point, and says he is going to start fielding orders from Klaus in the next few days, but first he has to make some things for Megumi."  
作为回应，真嗣也将他同样冰冷的手臂环绕在她的腰间，从她腋下穿过，最后停在她胸口下方，她对此短促地笑了一声。"抱歉今晚回来这么晚。约翰已经在 Point 那边把他的金属加工店开起来了，他说接下来几天要开始接克劳斯的订单了，不过在此之前得先给惠美做些东西。"

"Really? What does she need?"  
“真的吗？她需要什么？”

"She has the first pivot farming machine up and running, but she needs some things replaced on it. It was patterned on the old center pivot irrigators, but uses interchangeable attachments to disk, plant and cover, and irrigate the fields. She wants to have three more like it up and running" he paused to yawn, "before the first snow, and said that there shouldn't be a problem with planting several different crops on one field."  
“她的第一台中心旋转耕作机已经投入运行，但需要更换一些部件。它是根据旧式中心旋转灌溉机设计的，但采用了可互换的附件来进行犁地、种植、覆盖和灌溉。她希望在第一场雪之前再有三台类似的机器投入运行，并表示在同一块田地上种植几种不同的作物应该没有问题。”他停下来打了个哈欠，“她说在同一块田地上种植几种不同的作物应该没有问题。”

"Speaking of crops, I went to Danysa today for a checkup. She said that everything looked good, but nothing else to report," she said dejectedly. She and Shinji had been, maybe trying was too strong a word, hoping for a baby for a while, but were still not having much luck. "She said that some people just have a hard time for a couple of years and then it happens, so 'Don't give up'. Do you think there might be something wrong with me Shinji?" A tinge of worry was evident in her voice now.  
“说到作物，我今天去丹妮莎那里做了检查。她说一切都看起来不错，但没有其他报告，”她沮丧地说。她和真嗣已经，也许“尝试”这个词太强烈了，希望有个孩子已经有一段时间了，但仍然没有太多运气。“她说有些人只是会困难几年，然后就成功了，所以‘不要放弃’。你觉得我是不是有什么问题，真嗣？”她的声音中明显流露出一丝担忧。

He didn't think there was anything wrong with her and he told her so. "The only thing wrong is that you're worrying about it, I think. We'll see what happens, OK? Don't worry." She accepted this well enough, but allowed herself to worry a little bit.  
他不觉得她有什么问题，并且也这么告诉了她。“唯一的问题是你太担心了，我觉得。我们看看会发生什么，好吗？别担心。”她对此表示接受，但还是忍不住有点担忧。

She thought for a little while about what they might do as the community got established. They didn't really have any skills that the others needed. Shinji had already established himself as a jack-of-all-trades, and they could learn much of what they needed in a short amount of time, really, but what was needed of them? "Shinji, are you going back to the Point tomorrow to learn more metal-working from John?"  
她思考了一会儿，随着社区的建立，他们能做些什么。他们并没有什么其他人需要的技能。真嗣已经证明了自己是个多面手，他们也能在短时间内学到很多所需的东西，但实际上，他们需要做些什么呢？“真嗣，你明天会回点去跟约翰学习更多的金属加工吗？”

There was no answer from behind her. Shinji had fallen asleep in the last couple of minutes and was with her in his dreams. Smiling to herself, she hurried into sleep to meet him there.  
她身后没有回应。真嗣在过去的几分钟里已经睡着了，梦里与她同在。她微微一笑，急忙进入梦乡去与他相会。

Over the last couple of months since the end of Phase I, most of the members of the community had taken the weekends off to pursue their own interests at home. Some did home improvements, other read, others still took time to perform other private activities. The three relationships who had found one another on the voyage, had ballooned to 6 couples. The originals, James and Fenna, John and Linda, and Mikhail and Cassandra had now been joined by Hugo and Megumi, Klaus and Renee, and an interesting relationship between Wei, Phuong, and Shahla. Conventional, read previous, society had disapproved by and large couplings such as these.  
自第一阶段结束后的这几个月里，社区的大多数成员都选择在周末休息，追求各自的兴趣爱好。有些人忙于家居改善，有些人阅读，还有些人则抽时间进行其他私人活动。原本在航行中结成的三对情侣，如今已发展成六对。最初的詹姆斯和芬娜、约翰和琳达、米哈伊尔和卡桑德拉，现在又加入了雨果和梅古米、克劳斯和蕾妮，以及魏、璞琼和莎赫拉之间的一段有趣关系。传统意义上的社会，即之前的观念，大多对这类结合持反对态度。

While many of the people of the community had come from societies that held views like this, they did their best not to pass judgment, because for one thing, there were disparate numbers between the genders. There was no getting around that. It would seem unfair that one or more of the women be denied a relationship with their preferred mate based on an outdated and frankly irrelevant concept. Had the situation been reversed, some supposed that the men would feel glad that they could at least be with someone rather than being on the outside.  
尽管社区中许多人来自持有此类观点的社会，但他们尽力避免评判他人，因为首先，性别比例差异明显，这是无法回避的事实。基于过时且无关紧要的观念，让一位或多位女性因其偏爱的伴侣而无法建立关系，似乎有失公允。如果情况颠倒过来，有人推测男性可能会庆幸至少能与某人相伴，而非被排除在外。

Today, Shinji was taking some time to build a cover over a brick patio that he had constructed, with the help of a few others, a few weeks ago. They had found a large cache of bricks on pallets in town, and he had the idea that he wanted a brick sitting area with a firepit. It had gone smoothly enough. The finished product was about 20 feet square with corners cut diagonally to produce a hexagon. The bricks were in a herringbone pattern, and the cutting of the outside bricks and placing them, had taken the longest.  
今天，真嗣抽空在几周前与几位帮手一起建造的砖砌露台上搭建遮盖。他们在镇上发现了一大堆装在托盘上的砖块，他便萌生了想要一个带火坑的砖砌休息区的想法。整个过程还算顺利。成品大约 20 英尺见方，角落被斜切形成六边形。砖块采用了人字形图案，而切割外砖并放置它们花费了最长时间。

Sameer would be over soon to help as he had the most experience working with wood. Shinji had helped him last weekend with replacing a window on his house that was leaking cold air in, making it difficult to keep heated. He had indicated that he wanted to discuss something of importance with Shinji today also, so the work would give them the chance.  
萨米尔很快就会过来帮忙，因为他有最丰富的木材加工经验。上周末，真嗣协助他更换了家中漏风的一扇窗户，那使得保持室内温暖变得困难。萨米尔还表示今天想与真嗣讨论一件重要的事情，因此这项工作正好给了他们机会。

There were brackets set into the bricks that were placed there to accept the 4x6 posts. Shinji had measured and cut the upright members and was preparing to start on the beams when he saw Sameer getting out of his car. The electric vehicles that many of them had found and James had repaired were very quiet. He hadn't even heard it drive up.  
砖块中嵌入了用于固定 4x6 柱子的支架。真嗣已经测量并切割好了立柱，正准备开始处理横梁时，他看到萨米尔从他的车里出来。他们许多人找到并由詹姆斯修复的电动汽车非常安静。他甚至没听到车开过来的声音。

"Shinji, my friend!" Sameer announced in his familiar Arabic infused accent. "I hope that we can get this done today. It is looking like snow Abdou says, but I wonder if I can trust him. He is from Senegal and they do not see much snow!" Sameer always had some funny things to say.  
“真嗣，我的朋友！”萨米尔用他那熟悉的阿拉伯口音宣布道，“希望我们今天能完成这项工作。阿布杜说可能会下雪，但我怀疑我能否相信他。他是塞内加尔人，那里可不怎么下雪！”萨米尔总是有些有趣的话要说。

"With luck, I think we can do it. Asuka said she would join us in a while. The chickens are giving her a hard time after escaping earlier today," Shinji indicated the posts which were laying to the side of the brick patio. "Shall we?"  
“运气好的话，我想我们能做到。明日香说她一会儿会加入我们。今天鸡群逃脱后给她添了不少麻烦，”真嗣指着砖砌露台旁放置的柱子说，“我们开始吧？”

In response, Sameer picked up one end of the nearest post, and together then began construction. While they worked, Sameer broached the subject that had been vexing him. "Shinji, my friend, how did you and Asuka meet?"  
作为回应，萨梅尔拿起最近一根柱子的一端，然后他们一起开始搭建。在工作中，萨梅尔提起了困扰他的话题。“真嗣，我的朋友，你和明日香是怎么认识的？”

That was a question alright. "Well to tell you the truth, our first encounter was not really all that positive. I have told you about our piloting experience, yes?" Sameer nodded and twirled his hand as if to say, go on, go on. "Well she and her… robot, were on their way to Japan on an aircraft carrier. My friends and I went out to meet with her and escort her into Tokyo. We really didn't get off on the right foot, though, and I think we were both partially to blame." This last was what Shinji considered a concession that made a marriage work.  
这确实是个问题。“好吧，说实话，我们的初次相遇并不怎么愉快。我跟你说过我们的驾驶经历，对吧？”萨梅尔点点头，手势旋转着，仿佛在说，继续，继续。“嗯，她和她的……机器人，正乘着航空母舰前往日本。我和朋友们出去迎接她，护送她进入东京。但我们一开始就没走对路，我想我们双方都有责任。”这最后一点是真嗣认为能让婚姻维系下去的让步。

"How did you woo her, tell me."  
“你是怎么追求她的，告诉我。”

"Well, to tell you the truth, Sameer, we both had a hand in that. Asuka had some problems in her mind that she had to deal with, and did not want to be alone in the world after Third Impact. I told her that I would stay with her, and eventually she came to see me as a person she wanted to be with." Shinji blushed a bit at this. He sometimes found himself disbelieving his fortune in finding someone to love. His life before Third Impact has been a string of bad experiences punctuated by brief instances of pleasure and belonging. In his life after Third Impact he had grown close to someone and could really share his experiences with her.  
"嗯，说实话，Sameer，这事我们俩都有份。Asuka 心里有些问题需要处理，而且在第三次冲击后她不想独自一人面对这个世界。我告诉她我会陪着她，最终她开始把我看作一个她愿意与之共度的人。" Shinji 说到这里脸颊微微泛红。他有时觉得自己的好运难以置信，竟然找到了一个可以爱的人。第三次冲击前的生活对他来说是一连串糟糕的经历，偶尔穿插着短暂的快乐和归属感。而冲击后的生活里，他与人亲近，真正能够分享彼此的经历。

"Shinji, I must ask, I must. Do you know if Nazli is interested in anyone?"  
"Shinji，我必须问，我必须。你知道 Nazli 对谁有意思吗？"

Ah, so there it was. Sameer had been trying to figure out how he could break the ice with Nazli. "I have never seen her with anyone, really. She has been helping out Danysa and Amelie at the lab for a while. Why don't you stop by there?"  
啊，原来如此。Sameer 一直在琢磨怎么和 Nazli 搭上话。"我从来没见她和谁在一起过，真的。她一直在实验室帮 Danysa 和 Amelie 的忙。你为什么不去那儿看看呢？"

"Ah! What would I say? Why would I be there?"  
"啊！我该说什么？我为什么会在这里？"

"Say you… have a pain in your knees and you want something to relieve the pain. Then chat her up for a while after you get it." Shinji saw Asuka coming outside to lend him a hand. He hoped she could give him a hand with the conversation more.  
"比如说你……膝盖疼，想要点缓解疼痛的东西。然后拿到之后再跟她聊一会儿。" 真嗣看到明日香走出来想帮他一把。他希望她能在对话上再帮帮他。

"But I have good knees. I do not want to lie to her, Shinji. That is not a good foundation for a relationship to be built on."  
"但我膝盖不疼啊。我不想对她撒谎，真嗣。这不是建立关系的良好基础。"

"What are you guys talking about?" Asuka interjected as she walked up.  
“你们在聊什么呢？”明日香走过来插话道。

Sameer stammered, and Shinji outright told her, partly as a way of showing how truthful he could be in his relationship. "Sameer wants to get with Nazli."  
Sameer 结巴了，而真嗣直接告诉她，部分是为了展示他在关系中能有多真诚。“Sameer 想和 Nazli 在一起。”

This caused Sameer to stammer and protest even harder. When he realized that Shinji was just messing around with him, he quieted.  
这让 Sameer 更加结巴和抗议。当他意识到真嗣只是在逗他玩时，他安静了下来。

"Why don't you just go to the lab, and when they ask if there is anything they can do for you, just say that you would like to talk to Nazli. Take her aside, and tell her that you would like to have dinner or that you are interested in doing something with her."  
"你为什么不直接去实验室，当他们问你有什么需要帮忙的时候，就说你想和 Nazli 谈谈。把她带到一边，告诉她你想和她共进晚餐，或者你对和她一起做点什么感兴趣。"

"What?! This would never work. This would not work for me, Asuka. Nazli is much more intelligent than I am, and she would not want to hear what an uneducated builder has to say." Sameer had occasionally been self-deprecating regarding his intellect, but Shinji and Asuka had both seen the speed with which he could construct something that was needed. One did not become a construction foreman without a formal degree by sheer luck. You had to be capable and smart.  
"什么？！这根本行不通。这对我不适用，Asuka。Nazli 比我聪明得多，她不会想听一个没受过教育的建筑工人说什么。" Sameer 偶尔会自我贬低他的智力，但 Shinji 和 Asuka 都见过他快速建造所需物品的速度。一个没有正式学位就能成为建筑工头的人，绝非仅凭运气。你必须有能力且聪明。

"Listen, Sameer, my friend," Asuka started. She had found those two works helped open him up to suggestions very well. "I know Nazli. She is smart and educated, this is true. But she is also lonely. She has looked at you before. Go and ask her to have some dinner with you, and I promise, she will accept."  
"听着，Sameer，我的朋友，" Asuka 开口道。她发现这两个词很能让他接受建议。"我了解 Nazli。她聪明且受过教育，这是真的。但她也很孤独。她之前有注意到你。去邀请她共进晚餐，我保证，她会接受的。"

"You can be sure of this?" Sameer asked squinting his eyes.  
"你确定吗？" 萨米尔眯起眼睛问道。

"I guarantee it, my friend. You just have to ask." She looked to Shinji and gave him a wink.  
"我保证，我的朋友。你只需开口。" 她看向真嗣，眨了眨眼。

Through all of this discussion, the beams and rafters for the simple roof had been placed and secured. Shinji was using ¼ inch steel brackets and bolts to secure everything together. It would be strong, indeed. They finished the day putting on the sheet metal roofing. Shinji would have liked something like wooden shingle, but this would do. Soon they would have a nice place to sit and watch the snow during the long months of winter.  
在整个讨论过程中，简易屋顶的梁和椽已经放置并固定好了。真嗣使用¼英寸的钢制支架和螺栓来固定所有部件。这确实会很坚固。他们结束这一天的工作，安装了金属屋顶板。真嗣本想要木瓦屋顶，但这个也行。很快，他们将有一个舒适的地方，在漫长的冬季里坐着观赏雪景。

True to Asuka's word, Nazli accepted Sameers invitation, at least as much of it as she could hear as he was mumbling it very softly, and several nights later they had dinner. She told him what it was like growing up in Turkey, and going to school to learn psychology, and he told her all about growing up the 7th child in his family and rising in the construction company to project foreman. He tried to tell her several times that he thought that she was beautiful, and that her voice was lovely, that her hair was like black silk, but his words were always inadequate, and he felt like he was only making an ass of himself.  
正如明日香所言，纳兹莉接受了萨米尔的邀请，至少她能听到的那部分，因为他咕哝得非常轻。几晚后，他们共进晚餐。她向他讲述了在土耳其长大的经历，以及去学校学习心理学的日子；而他则向她倾诉自己是家中第七个孩子，如何在建筑公司一步步晋升为项目工头的往事。他多次试图告诉她，他认为她很美，她的声音悦耳动听，她的头发如黑丝般柔滑，但他的言辞总是显得苍白无力，他觉得自己只是在自取其辱。

He drove her home along the dark road in his silent electric car. The lights were on in her house, and her two roommates were still up. The porch light came on as they drove up, and he expected her to jump out and head right in when he stopped, but she did not. Instead, she sat in the passenger seat, hands folded in her lap looking at him. When he didn't move, she leaned across the center console and kissed him on the forehead, and each cheek, then planted a soft slow kiss on his mouth.  
他开着他那辆无声的电动车，沿着漆黑的道路送她回家。她家的灯还亮着，两个室友还没睡。当他们驶近时，门廊的灯亮了起来，他以为她会跳下车直接进去，但她没有。相反，她坐在副驾驶座上，双手叠放在膝上，凝视着他。见他没有动静，她便越过中控台，在他额头上轻轻一吻，又分别亲了亲他的双颊，最后在他唇上温柔而缓慢地印下一吻。

Without hesitation now, she did open the door and get out. She passed in front of his headlights and waved to him as she went up the four steps to the door, and then quickly disappeared inside.  
她毫不犹豫地打开了车门，走了出去。她从他的车前灯前经过，上台阶时向他挥了挥手，随后迅速消失在门内。

It was snowing outside. Shinji had secretly been waiting for this. He had found a lot of solace and good mind last year when he had experienced his first snow with Asuka. Now they were together completely, and it was snowing again. This morning, he thought it was the 28th of November, they had both awoken to a good 6 inches of snow on the ground. He had collected the eggs, they had about two dozen now, and were having a hard time keeping up with the chickens, and had made her an egg sandwich and some hot chocolate. They sat for a while on the stone patio after Shinji had built up a fire, and watched the snow fall. It was quiet except for the occasional wind in the trees and the distant sound of the stream where the hot spring was. They planned to head down there later. Shinji had noticed since yesterday that Asuka was excited about something, but every time he asked her about it, she would change the subject. He exercised his patience and felt certain that she would tell him when the proper time presented itself. He hoped it would be soon. Her birthday was only a few days away, and he wanted her to let him take care of her that day with no distractions.  
外面正飘着雪花。真嗣暗自期待着这一刻。去年他与明日香一同经历初雪时，找到了许多慰藉与心灵的宁静。如今他们已完全在一起，又迎来了雪天。今早，他以为日期是 11 月 28 日，两人醒来时，地上已积了约六英寸的雪。他去收了鸡蛋，现在大约有两打，几乎跟不上母鸡的产蛋速度，还为她做了鸡蛋三明治和热巧克力。真嗣生起火后，他们坐在石制露台上，静静观赏着雪花飘落。四周静谧，只有偶尔的林间风声和远处温泉溪流的潺潺声。他们计划稍后去那里。自昨天起，真嗣就注意到明日香似乎对某事异常兴奋，但每当他问起，她总是转移话题。他耐心等待，确信她会在恰当的时机告诉他。他希望那一天尽快到来。她的生日就在几天后，他渴望在那一天全心全意地照顾她，不受任何打扰。

They had been talking in hushed tones all morning, not out of fear of being heard, but perhaps feeling that to speak to loudly might upset the calm that flowed around them this morning. "Sameer called me last night and told me that he and Nazli are going on their 4th date."  
"他们整个上午都在低声交谈，并非出于害怕被听见，而是或许觉得说话声太大可能会打破今晨环绕他们的宁静。“萨梅尔昨晚给我打电话，说他和纳兹莉要去进行他们的第四次约会。””

"Their 4th? Is he doing dinner again or what? What do they do on their dates?"  
“第四次？他又打算请吃饭吗？他们约会都做些什么？”

"Not really sure. I think he took her to the library once and asked her to pick out a book for him. He wanted to please her by listening to a recommendation of hers." Shinji explained. Asuka pursed her mouth in a considering look, then shrugged. "It looks like they may be an item, so it looks like your meddling worked out."  
“不太确定。我想他曾带她去过图书馆一次，让她帮他挑本书。他想通过听从她的推荐来取悦她。”真嗣解释道。明日香抿着嘴，若有所思地看了看，然后耸了耸肩。“看来他们可能要成一对了，看来你的撮合奏效了。”

"For the record, I don't meddle. I steer."  
"作为记录，我不干涉，我引导。"

Later on, the bath that they took in the stream was quite warm, and the lovemaking afterward was too. When it is cold outside, sometimes you have to do whatever you need to do to stay warm. Shinji was certain Asuka was about to tell him something, but she stayed her tongue and the look went away in a moment.  
尽管梅格希望在初雪前准备好枢轴装置，但她自豪地在初雪后两天完成了它们。12 月 3 日，真嗣、克劳斯、明日香和梅格一起出去检查这些装置。虽然梅格和克劳斯是真正了解它们的人，但其他人也对它们感兴趣。不难看出它们是如何工作的，但由于有许多活动部件，仍有一些神秘感存在。

Despite her hopes to get the pivot devices ready by first snow, Megumi was proud that she had them done by two days after the first snow. Shinji, Klaus, Asuka, and Megumi went out to inspect the devices on the 3rd of December. While Megumi and Klaus were the ones who really knew what they were looking at, the others were interested in them. It was not hard to see how they worked, but with so many moving parts some mystery still remained.

Megumi estimated that they would have this many tons of cabbage and that many tones of carrots and so many tons of corn, but Shinji had not yet wrapped his head around how much all of that really was. It sounded like it would feed them for years if it could be preserved, but then, that was the trick wasn't it? They would really have to start looking to cooking seasonal meals.  
惠美估计他们会有这么多吨的卷心菜和那么多吨的胡萝卜以及这么多吨的玉米，但真嗣还没完全理解这些到底有多少。听起来足够他们吃上好几年，如果能够保存的话，但问题是，这真的能做到吗？他们真的得开始考虑烹饪季节性餐食了。

With the finishing of the agricultural phase II, they had to wait out the winter and then apply their hard work to the field and the areas of expertise of the others who were working in their own disciplines. Despite occasional hiccups which they had so far had no difficulty overcoming, they had made incredible progress in only the last three and a half months. Who knew what the next months would bring?  
随着农业二期工程的完成，他们得熬过冬天，然后将辛勤的劳动成果应用到田地和其他各自专业领域的工作中。尽管偶尔会遇到一些小问题，但他们迄今为止都能轻松克服，仅在过去三个半月里就取得了惊人的进展。谁知道接下来的几个月会带来什么呢？

Asuka opened her eyes to the bright light of day. The light streamed in through the windows illuminating the room with a few wispy snowflakes lazily floating by. The space next to her was empty of the Shinji that usually slept there. It was cold so he had been up for some time. She sat up, and that was when she saw it.  
明日香睁开眼睛，迎接明媚的晨光。阳光透过窗户洒进房间，几片轻飘飘的雪花悠闲地飘过。她身旁的空位通常是真嗣睡觉的地方，现在却空无一人。因为冷，他早已起床。她坐起身，这时她看到了。

It hung on a cross shaped hanger, holding the sleeves out straight. The kimono was brightly colored with lots of warm tones of red and yellow. It was a flowery pattern with butterflies on it too. The sleeves were long, almost coming down past her knees, and the belt that accompanied it was a deep blue that added stark contrast to the ensemble.  
它挂在一个十字形的衣架上，袖子笔直展开。这件和服色彩鲜艳，充满了温暖的红色和黄色调。图案繁花似锦，还点缀着蝴蝶。袖子很长，几乎垂至她的膝盖，与之相配的腰带则是深蓝色，为整体增添了鲜明的对比。

This was her kimono from the previous year. Shinji had gotten up earlier and put it out for her. She could hear him moving around in the kitchen, and wondered if he was making her favorites again. She stood and looked at herself in the mirror, pressing her hands to her flat tummy. She wished she could keep the secret longer, but it was going to explode out of her if she didn't do it soon. Smiling to herself, she turned and started donning the kimono just as she had previously. It still fit her quite well. She was a little taller now than she had been, perhaps even t bit leaner with all of the work that they had been doing lately.  
这是她去年的和服。真嗣比平时起得更早，为她准备好了。她能听到他在厨房里忙碌的声音，不知道他是不是又在为她做最爱吃的菜。她站起来，对着镜子打量自己，双手轻按在平坦的小腹上。她希望这个秘密能再藏久一点，但如果不尽快说出来，它就要爆发了。她对自己微微一笑，转身开始像以前那样穿上和服。它依然很合身。她现在比那时高了一些，也许因为最近忙于工作，身材也略显瘦削了些。

She stepped out of the room 10 minutes later, and padded down the hallway toward the kitchen and dining room. Shinji was spooning a heavy cream sauce into a gravy boat and he looked up to see her when she entered the room.  
十分钟后，她走出房间，沿着走廊向厨房和餐厅走去。真嗣正用勺子将浓稠的奶油酱舀进酱汁船里，当她走进房间时，他抬头看向她。

There was less food than the year before, but that was to be expected. There was not a lot that could be made from the rations that helped draw out the real food. Today's fare was caramelized pork loins with mashed potatoes and gravy, sauerkraut, some sliced chilled fruit with whipped cream on it. There were tiny dots of fresh vanilla bean in the whipped cream.  
食物比去年少了，但这在意料之中。从配给中能做出的花样并不多，真正的美食更是难得。今天的菜肴是焦糖烤猪里脊配土豆泥和肉汁，还有酸菜，以及一些切片冷藏水果，上面铺着打发的奶油。奶油中点缀着新鲜香草豆的小点。

They ate heartily, Asuka savoring every bite. She was hungry, and the food was filling. Shinji was glad to see that she liked it. He had never made pork like this, but it had turned out really well. As they finished, he felt there was an admission to be made. "Asuka, I'm afraid the meal and the robe are the only things I have for your birthday. I didn't have time to make you anything this time, and I feel pretty bad about it."  
他们吃得津津有味，明日香细细品味每一口。她饿了，而这顿饭让她感到满足。真嗣很高兴看到她喜欢这顿饭。他以前从未这样做过猪肉，但结果非常成功。吃完后，他觉得有些话不得不说。“明日香，恐怕这顿饭和这件长袍是我为你生日准备的全部了。这次我没时间给你做别的，我感到很抱歉。”

"Shinji…" Asuka smiled at him and shook her head. This man would bend over backward for her, and then apologize because he thought it wasn't enough. "You have given me the most wonderful thing. I actually got it a little while back, but it took me a while to find out.' She was smiling so hard that her cheeks hurt and she felt a tear roll down each one. "Shinji, I'm pregnant."  
“真嗣……”明日香对他微笑着摇了摇头。这个男人会为她竭尽全力，然后因为觉得自己做得不够而道歉。“你已经给了我最好的礼物。其实我不久前就收到了，但花了些时间才弄明白。”她笑得脸颊都疼了，两行泪水顺着脸颊滑落。“真嗣，我怀孕了。”

Understandably, Shinji was at a loss for words, but he was smiling.  
可以理解的是，真嗣一时语塞，但他露出了微笑。

### Chapter 20 Of Sowing and Harvest

It was a testament to the distance that Shinji had come from his former self. He beamed at Asuka. While the thought of being responsible for the life of another was not new to him, he had been partially responsible for Asuka and the others to one extent or another for a while now, the idea of being completely responsible for the health, welfare and life of another person was an amazing, and a little terrifying feeling.  
这证明了真嗣已从过去的自己走出多远。他对着明日香露出灿烂的笑容。尽管对另一个生命负责的想法对他来说并不陌生，他一直以来或多或少都对明日香和其他人负有部分责任，但完全承担起另一个人的健康、福祉乃至生命的念头，是一种既令人惊叹又略带恐惧的感觉。

They had hugged, and kissed, laughed and kissed, then finished cleaning up their meal. Shinji wanted to go tell everyone he could find, but decided that this was still Asuka's day, and they still had a leisurely bath to take in a while. Maybe they would go out later. Asuka secretly hoped that it would start snowing that day, but it was pretty clear outside with no clouds in sight, so it seemed unlikely.  
他们拥抱、亲吻、欢笑，然后一起收拾了晚餐。真嗣本想跑去告诉每一个他能找到的人，但又觉得这依然是明日香的日子，他们稍后还有个悠闲的泡澡时光。或许晚些时候他们会出去走走。明日香暗自希望那天会下雪，但外面晴空万里，不见一丝云彩，看来不太可能。

They walked down to the stream where the rising hot water mingled with the much colder water causing a rippling swirling on the surface, and a cloudiness beneath. Unfortunately the warm water was a few feet from the rock ledge that jutted into the water. The worst part was getting in and out. One had to brave the bracing cold water to get to the hot center, and again on the way back to the bank.  
他们沿着小溪走下去，那里涌出的热水与更冷的水混合，水面泛起涟漪，水下则变得浑浊。不幸的是，温暖的水域离那块伸入水中的岩石边缘有几英尺远。最糟糕的是进出水域的过程。必须勇敢面对刺骨的冷水才能到达热水的中心，然后再回到岸边。

Often, before they had left for Germany, they would come here in the late afternoon. At this time of year, the sun would set between the trees, reflecting off of the rippling current, lighting the stream up like flowing pool of fire that would empty into a lake a few miles downstream. This time, the sun was high, but that did not detract from the mood. It was crisp and cool outside, the leaves had fallen, and the world waited for snow clouds to descend upon their valley.  
常常，在他们前往德国之前，他们会在这个傍晚时分来到这里。每年这个时候，太阳会在树林间落下，阳光反射在波光粼粼的水面上，照亮了溪流，宛如一条流动的火河，几英里下游汇入湖泊。这次，太阳高悬，但这并未影响氛围。外面清新凉爽，树叶已落，世界等待着雪云降临他们的山谷。

Shinji had brought some sake that he had heated before they left, and they sat against a couple of water smoothed rocks and drank some of it. Asuka had never quite gotten the taste for sake, and she imagined Shinji hadn't either. It burned a little going down, and for the most part you didn't feel many of the effects of it until you tried standing up. They only had a couple of sips though, so it was unlikely they would have a hard time getting out.  
真嗣带了一些出发前加热过的清酒，他们背靠几块被水磨平的岩石坐下，喝了几口。明日香从未完全习惯清酒的味道，她猜真嗣也是。清酒下肚时有点烧灼感，大部分情况下，你不会立刻感受到它的效果，直到你试图站起来。不过他们只喝了几口，所以不太可能会有起身困难的问题。

They spoke of names, and trimesters, education, and medical concerns. They wondered if there was a boy or a girl, and wondered if it really mattered. They held hands under the water almost like they were hiding their little display of affection from a public that did not tolerate it. Mostly they sat in silence and absorbed the day. Shinji silently told himself that they needed to mandate a weekly relaxation day. This was a great way to keep the fast paced, almost break-neck, events from overwhelming you.  
他们谈论着名字、孕期、教育以及医疗问题。他们猜测着是男孩还是女孩，又或者这真的重要吗。他们在水下牵着手，仿佛在躲避那些不宽容的公众，不让他们看到这小小的亲昵举动。大多数时候，他们静静地坐着，沉浸在这一天中。真嗣默默地告诉自己，他们需要规定一个每周的放松日。这是保持快节奏、几乎让人喘不过气来的事件不至于压垮自己的好方法。

Asuka leaned against him, laying her head on his chest and closed her eyes. He smelled her hair, felt the bumpy dry skin on her elbows, watched the pulsing of her heartbeat in her neck, and wondered about the life that was growing in her now. She was far from the person he had been with on the beach. Further even from the person he had met on the aircraft carrier. That had been a lifetime ago hadn't it? Thinking back it had only been about two and a half years.  
明日香靠在他身上，将头枕在他的胸口，闭上了眼睛。他闻着她的发香，感受着她手肘上粗糙不平的皮肤，注视着她脖颈上脉搏的跳动，思索着此刻在她体内孕育的新生命。她已远非那个在海滩上与他相伴的人。甚至比他们在航母上相遇时还要遥远。那已经是前世的事了吧？回想起来，其实不过才两年半左右。

He rarely thought about the person Asuka had been in the last weeks of the old era. He had noticed her slipping into and out of the house. She had been skipping school the whole time. Hikari had told him that Asuka had stayed at her place for a few days, but then Asuka had disappeared and she didn't know to where. He shuddered to think of her living on the street, and the things she might have seen there. She never talked about it; likely it was the kind of dark place that one doesn't like to revisit.  
他很少去想旧时代最后几周里阿斯卡的样子。他注意到她进进出出房子，那段时间她一直在逃学。光告诉他，阿斯卡在她家住过几天，但后来就消失了，她也不知道她去了哪里。他一想到她可能在街头流浪，以及她可能看到的那些景象，就不寒而栗。她从未谈及这些；可能那是那种人们不愿再回忆的黑暗之地。

He vowed to do his best to always be there for his children. They could always count on him to help them out, because that is what parents are for damnit. He would never allow what had happened to he and Asuka to continue on to the next generation.  
他发誓要尽全力一直陪伴在孩子身边。他们可以永远依靠他来帮助他们，因为这就是父母该死的职责。他绝不允许自己和阿斯卡所经历的痛苦延续到下一代。

---

A little while later, Shinji and Asuka, having dressed in a couple of layers of clothing to ward off the cold, drove to James and Fennas house which was not far away. Shinji let Asuka tell them since she had become close to Fenna over the last few months and the squealing and crying volleyed back and forth between them like a tennis ball. James, who had been living with Fenna since they had arrived, had never seen her this excited and wondered what she would be like if she got pregnant, then did his best to put the nuclear excitement detonation out of his mind.  
不久之后，真嗣和明日香为了抵御寒冷，穿上了几层衣服，驱车前往詹姆斯和芬娜的家，距离并不远。真嗣让明日香来告诉他们，因为这几个月她与芬娜变得亲近，两人之间的尖叫和哭泣像网球一样来回飞舞。詹姆斯自从他们到来后一直与芬娜同住，从未见过她如此兴奋，不禁好奇如果她怀孕了会是什么样子，然后尽力将这核爆般的兴奋从脑海中抹去。

"Well, Shinji, ready to step into your fathers shoes?" James asked, then immediately felt bad about it knowing what he had learned about Shinji's father.  
“那么，真嗣，准备好踏入你父亲的鞋子里了吗？”詹姆斯问道，随即感到有些内疚，因为他知道真嗣的父亲的事情。

"He took his shoes off. I'm not going to do that," Shinji's face displayed the cold seriousness of the statement. There was little of his father in him, if anything. He didn't hate the man, but he certainly no longer felt any sympathy or sought any love from him or his memory.  
“他把鞋子脱了。我不会那么做，”真嗣的脸上显露出冷酷的严肃。他身上几乎没有他父亲的影子，如果有的话。他并不恨那个人，但他肯定不再对他或他的记忆感到任何同情或寻求任何爱。

The ladies calmed down with Fenna fanning herself and Asuka taking a deep breath or two. "Oh my god, have you told anyone else?"  
女士们渐渐平静下来，Fenna 扇着自己，而 Asuka 深呼吸了一两次。“我的天，你告诉过其他人吗？”

"No, you're the first." “没有，你是第一个。”

"Well we need to tell everyone!" Fenna exclaimed. Shinji and Asuka had not taken off their coats, and Fenna was getting hers and James'. James looked to Shinji with a "Well, I guess it is decided" look and shrugged.  
“那我们得告诉大家！”Fenna 喊道。Shinji 和 Asuka 还没脱下外套，而 Fenna 正拿起她和 James 的外套。James 看向 Shinji，带着一种“好吧，看来已经决定了”的表情，耸了耸肩。

The party had grown to encompass the whole community in less than an hour. They had descended on the collection site with bowls and plates of food for an impromptu potluck. There was some drinking, but no one overdid it. Someone had hooked up a stereo and was playing a wide selection of music. There was general laughter and merriment, a lot of back slapping for Shinji and a ton of gushing and general excitement for Asuka.  
不到一小时，派对已经扩展到整个社区。他们带着装满食物的碗盘，蜂拥至集合点，举行了一场即兴的聚餐。虽然有人喝酒，但没有人过量。有人接通了音响，播放着各式各样的音乐。笑声和欢乐弥漫四周，许多人拍着真嗣的背表示祝贺，对明日香则是满满的赞美和兴奋之情。

Asuka didn't know how many times she had been asked to tell about how she had met Shinji or how they'd fallen in love. She didn't get tired of telling it though. She thought that many of the ladies wanted romance like that, although Sameer and Nazli seemed to be off to a good start. Speaking of which, she didn't see them anywhere.  
明日香不知道自己被问了多少次关于她和真嗣相遇以及如何坠入爱河的故事。尽管如此，她并不厌倦讲述。她觉得许多女士都渴望那样的浪漫，尽管萨米尔和纳兹莉似乎已经有了个不错的开始。说到他们，她四处张望却没见到他们的身影。

At one point Danysa and Amelie stopped to talk to Asuka. She knew what they were going to say, but politely let them speak all the same.  
有一次，丹妮莎和阿梅莉停下来和明日香交谈。她知道她们要说什么，但还是礼貌地让她们说完。

"You know, we have set up quite the little hospital in that clinic in town. When it comes time, you'll have the best care there is. I've already told Linda the same thing, and I want you to know that I have performed quite a few births in the few years that I was practicing in Rwanda, and there I didn't have nearly the facilities that I have here."  
"你知道吗，我们在镇上的诊所里建立了一个相当不错的小医院。到了时候，你会得到最好的护理。我已经跟琳达说了同样的话，我想让你知道，我在卢旺达行医的那几年里，接生过不少孩子，尽管那里没有我现在这里的设施齐全。"

"And by the time you are due, I should have some anesthetic to help out." Amelie put in.  
"等到你临产时，我应该能准备一些麻醉剂来帮忙。" 阿梅丽补充道。

"You know, I was thinking that I might try to do it without anesthetic." Asuka replied to their knowing smiles. Those smiles were the 'we'll-see-about-that-when-the-time-comes' looks she had expected. She knew a little something about pain. Maybe they would have need of the drugs, maybe not. We'll see indeed.  
"你知道，我在想我可能会尝试不用麻醉剂。" 明日香回应着他们心照不宣的微笑。那些微笑正是她预料中的'到时候再看'的表情。她对疼痛略知一二。也许他们会需要那些药物，也许不需要。到时候确实见分晓。

The party went on for another two hours. Linda, who was pretty far along as far as they could figure, bowed out first. She did not have much energy these days. John left with her. After that, every five or ten minutes, another couple or trio would pick up the remains of their food and apologize and head home. Pretty soon, it was the original four left.  
派对又持续了两个小时。琳达，据他们估计已经相当晚了，第一个退出。她最近没什么精力。约翰和她一起离开了。之后，每隔五到十分钟，就会有一对或三个人拿起剩下的食物，道歉后回家。不久，就只剩下原来的四个人了。

James swirled some sake in a clear straight table glass. "So, mate. Am I to understand that you are not going to find out what it will be on the ultra-sound when it is time?"  
詹姆斯在透明的直边桌玻璃杯中旋转着一些清酒。“那么，伙计。我是不是可以理解为，到时候你不会去查超声波检查的结果？”

"We decided not to. People made do without knowledge for thousands of years before the ultrasound came along. And the clothes only last a couple of months before they're too small. There really isn't any need I think."  
“我们决定不查。超声波出现之前，人们几千年来没有这些知识也过得去。而且衣服只穿几个月就会太小。我认为真的没有这个必要。”

James lifted his eyebrows and nodded frowning his mouth in that considering look he sometimes took up. "We're going to have a burgeoning population here before long, Shinji. Gonna have to put up a school and figure out some kind of daycare system."  
詹姆斯扬起眉毛，皱着眉头点了点头，露出了他有时会摆出的那种深思熟虑的表情。“我们这里很快就会人口激增，真嗣。得建所学校，还得想出某种托儿系统。”

"I had actually been thinking about that a bit lately," Asuka said. "A crèche or some kind of child care service that parents could use so that they could do their work. But at the same time, it would not just be a place to keep the kids, we would need some education too."  
“我最近其实也在考虑这个问题，”明日香说，“一个托儿所或者某种父母可以使用的儿童保育服务，这样他们就能工作了。但同时，这不仅仅是一个看孩子的地方，我们还需要提供一些教育。”

The other three agreed, but also agreed that it was a bit too early to plan anything concrete. Linda would be the first to give birth, and it would be a few months before she could really be expected at work. She had been filling in at the library some recently. Quite often they needed information, and she had become an indispensable resource for information finding. Maybe if they approached her about it, she might like the idea of taking care of the children.  
其他三人都表示同意，但也认为现在规划具体事项还为时过早。琳达将是第一个分娩的人，她需要几个月的时间才能真正重返工作岗位。最近她一直在图书馆帮忙。他们经常需要信息，而她在信息查找方面已成为不可或缺的资源。也许如果他们向她提出这个想法，她可能会喜欢照顾孩子的主意。

Linda had actually come to Asuka two months earlier asking about what she could do to pull her weight. She had been a paralegal before all this had happened, and there was just not a lot of need for a person of her experience in their work. But recordkeeping, inventory, document management, and now the library had provided her with things to do. With her filing system in place (and much of the software automation that Hugo had written) taking care of a lot of the work, she was left with less and less to do now.  
两个月前，琳达其实就来到明日香这里，询问她能做些什么来尽自己的一份力。在这之前，她是一名律师助理，但在他们的工作中，像她这样经验的人手并不太需要。不过，记录管理、库存盘点、文件整理，以及现在的图书馆工作，都为她提供了事情做。有了她建立的档案系统（以及雨果编写的大部分软件自动化）处理了许多工作，她现在手头的事情越来越少。

Twenty minutes later, they said their good byes and closed up the Collection Point. Shinji figured that it should be capitalized now. They had ended up amassing 38 forty-foot shipping containers worth of supplies. Seeds and farming gear to last them for years even if whole crops died, spare parts for nearly every working machine they had, woodworking and metal working machines in such variation that you could build literally anything with them. It was a staggering amount of materiel they that collected in such a short time, and it was now waiting for spring to come so that it could be put to use. Spring would come soon enough, but in the meantime, there was quite a bit still to do.  
二十分钟后，他们道别并关闭了物资收集点。真嗣认为现在应该将其大写。他们最终积累了相当于 38 个四十英尺集装箱的物资。即便整个农作物死亡，种子和农具也足够他们使用多年；几乎所有现有机器的备用零件，以及种类繁多的木工和金属加工机器，几乎可以用它们建造任何东西。在如此短的时间内收集到如此庞大的物资，实在令人震惊，而这些物资现在正等待着春天的到来，以便投入使用。春天很快就会到来，但在此之前，还有很多事情要做。

---

The snow that winter was heavier than the previous winter. During one particularly nasty storm, there was just under two and a half meters deposited on the mountains. All landmarks were obliterated under a sound damping blanket of powder. No amount of preparation can really make you ready for such an event. A snow plow roster was made so that people could rotate the plowing of the roads between homes, the Collection Point and the clinic that they had taken to calling the hospital.  
那个冬天的雪比前一个冬天更重。在一次特别恶劣的风暴中，山上有近两米半的积雪。所有地标都被一层隔音的粉雪覆盖，消失无踪。无论做多少准备，都无法真正让你为这样的事件做好准备。他们制定了一个扫雪轮值表，以便人们可以轮流清扫连接住宅、物资收集点和被称为医院的诊所之间的道路。

One person would plow, then drive to the next individual's house and spend a few hours there. When it was time to plow again, they would get a ride back to their own house. This kept the roads moderately clear, and only one tree got clipped by the snow plow, thanks to Hugo.  
一个人先犁地，然后开车到下一个人的家，在那里待上几个小时。等到再次需要犁地时，他们就搭车回到自己家。这样既保持了道路适度畅通，又多亏了 Hugo，只有一棵树被雪犁刮到。

A few times the community members got together in an attempt to relieve the cabin fever. Shinji's covered firepit was a favorite gathering place. Later in the winter, toward the middle of February, Shinji and Asuka invited James and Fenna to their natural hotspring.  
有几次，社区成员们聚在一起，试图缓解小屋热。真嗣的带顶火坑是个受欢迎的聚集地。到了冬季后期，大约二月中旬，真嗣和明日香邀请了詹姆斯和芬娜去他们的天然温泉。

The four of them had become good friends over the last few months with Shinji learning as much as he could from James' engineering (and other) experience. Fenna had come to value Asuka as a little sister, ensuring she kept prenatal appointments and asking her all about her time as a pilot, which Asuka was always glad to tell.  
这四个人在过去几个月里成为了好朋友，真嗣从詹姆斯的工程（及其他）经验中学到了很多。芬娜把明日香视为妹妹，确保她按时进行产检，并总是乐于听她讲述作为驾驶员的经历，明日香也总是很高兴分享。

There was something cathartic about relating those experiences, especially the dark ones. Once upon a time, she had been an ass-kicking, name-taking, cast iron bitch, and beneath it had been a frightened and lonely girl who just wanted people to like her. Fenna laughed about the Aircraft Carrier story and the story about the Musical Dancing Fight as she had come to call it. She had cried as Asuka relayed her time wandering the crumbling broken husks of the buildings of Tokyo-3, and imagined in fascination as Asuka described her epic fight with the JSSDF and the Mass Production models. Through all of this, Asuka felt like a weight had been lifted from her, a weight she had never even realized she had been carrying.  
讲述那些经历，尤其是那些阴暗的部分，有种净化心灵的感觉。曾经，她是个狠角色，敢作敢当，铁石心肠，而内心深处却是个渴望被人喜欢的孤独害怕的小女孩。芬娜笑着听她讲航空母舰的故事和那个她称之为“音乐舞蹈大战”的故事。当明日香讲述她在崩塌的东京-3 废墟中徘徊的经历时，她哭了，并着迷地想象着明日香与日本自卫队和量产机型那场史诗般的战斗。这一切过后，明日香感觉仿佛卸下了重担，一个她甚至未曾意识到自己一直背负的重担。

That evening, as they sat in the hot spring sipping tea, she felt that truly all was right with the world. She scoffed now at the appropriation of that verse. At the time, there had actually been very little that was right with the world. Now she felt that finally it was. They were happy, they were productive, both in the field and in the crop of children that were being sewn, and they had become a close knit group of people building a society that aspired to be better than the old. She ran her hand over her slightly bulging stomach.  
那个傍晚，当他们坐在温泉中品茶时，她感到世界确实无比美好。她现在对那句诗的挪用嗤之以鼻。当时，世界上其实很少有事情是正确的。如今她觉得终于一切都对了。他们幸福，他们富有成效，无论是在田野里还是在孕育的孩子们中，他们已经成为一个紧密团结的群体，建立着一个渴望超越旧时代的社会。她轻轻抚摸着自己微微隆起的腹部。

Danysa figured that she was at about 18 weeks of pregnancy at this point. Her previously flat stomach had pushed out into a noticeable convex. She was anxiously awaiting the first kicks, which should start happening soon. She had never felt a baby kick in another woman until Linda had come along. It was magical, and she did not use that word normally for anything, but in this case the heady feeling of knowing that a brand new life was inside and was moving was just that. She and Shinji had both heard the heartbeat overlaid with her own for the first time a few weeks previously. And while it was true that she got sick sometimes, always in the early afternoon rather than the morning, that was not so unpleasant as to discolor the other things that were happening.  
丹妮莎估摸着自己现在大约怀孕 18 周了。她原本平坦的小腹已经明显凸起。她焦急地等待着胎动的初体验，那应该很快就会开始。在琳达出现之前，她从未在其他女性身上感受过胎儿的踢动。那种感觉神奇至极，她平时很少用“神奇”这个词来形容任何事物，但此刻，意识到一个崭新的生命就在体内活动，那种令人陶醉的感觉确实如此。她和真嗣几周前第一次听到了胎儿的心跳，与她自己的心跳交织在一起。虽然她有时确实会感到不适，总是在午后而非早晨，但这并不足以掩盖其他正在发生的喜悦。

She made a mental note to go see Linda soon. She had given birth to a little boy that she had named Jason and he had the little wisps of blonde hair that had all the ladies cooing over him.  
她在心里记下要尽快去看望琳达。琳达生了个小男孩，取名杰森，他那几缕金色的细发让所有女士都为之倾倒。

They sat in the warm water, watching small bits of ice that had broken off upstream drift by. Asuka was telling about her days in college before the pilot program had taken over her life. She had been alone there. Completely alone. Obviously there were other students, but she was vastly younger than them. She was intimidated by them, and they quietly despised her. She breezed through her classes, while they toiled and struggled. None of them ever did anything to her or even said much at all for fear that they would look bad for picking on such a little girl. In her solitude, she had hated them. Occasionally a student here or there might overcome their disdain and seek help, but those were few and far between, and it never turned into a friendship. She had graduated near the top of the class, without really breaking a sweat. As she relayed this, she saw that Shinji was looking off to the setting sun, his cheeks red. With a glimmer of intuition, she realized that he was embarrassed, that he felt that he was nowhere near an equal to her. He had not even finished high school, she had volumes of knowledge that he did not (most of which was not of much practical use now). She surreptitiously reached under the water and pulled his hand to rest on her stomach, then smiled at him when he looked around.  
他们坐在温暖的水中，望着上游断裂的小块浮冰缓缓漂过。明日香正讲述着自己在成为驾驶员前的大学生涯。她在那里孤身一人，彻底的孤独。虽然周围有其他学生，但她比他们年轻许多。她被他们所震慑，而他们则暗自轻视她。她轻松应对课程，而他们却苦苦挣扎。出于担心欺负小女孩会显得自己不堪，他们从未对她做过什么，甚至很少与她交谈。在孤独中，她憎恨他们。偶尔会有学生克服轻蔑寻求帮助，但这样的人寥寥无几，且从未发展成友谊。她几乎不费吹灰之力就以优异成绩毕业。讲述这些时，她注意到真嗣正凝视着落日，双颊泛红。凭着一丝直觉，她意识到他在尴尬，感觉自己远不及她。他甚至还没完成高中学业，而她拥有他未曾涉猎的知识（其中大部分如今并无实际用途）。 她偷偷在水下伸手，将他的手拉到自己的肚子上，然后在他环顾四周时对他微笑。

They baby did not choose that moment to kick. It would have been perfect, but that was not the way it worked. She let the story fade away and they all sat in silence for a while taking in the crispness of the air and the darkening sky. It would be cold, freezing didn't even describe it, getting out of the water, but it was worth it to relax in the warmth with friends and loved ones.  
宝宝并没有选择那一刻踢动。那本该是完美的，但事情往往不尽如人意。她让那个故事渐渐淡去，他们一起静静地坐了一会儿，感受着空气的清新和天空的渐暗。从水中出来会非常冷，甚至用“冰冻”都不足以形容，但与朋友和爱人一起在温暖中放松是值得的。

A few feet away, Fenna and James sat in the hot water. Asuka noted that their hands were moving around under there a little and pretended not to notice. She kissed Shinji, and he kissed her back. Yes indeed, they would have to get out in a while, but for now, all was right with the world.  
几英尺外，Fenna 和 James 坐在热水里。Asuka 注意到他们的手在水下有些动作，便假装没看见。她亲吻了 Shinji，他也回吻了她。没错，他们一会儿就得出去，但此刻，世界一切都好。

---

The first day of planting came on the first day of April. While the winter had been very cold, it had also ended as though a switch had been thrown. After the last snow on the twelfth of March, it had quickly warmed during the daytime to 13 degrees and at night was getting down to about 8 degrees. Megumi, who had been reading through the almanacs for the last decade of the 20th century from the library, decided that this would be about time to start getting the cooler weather crops out there.  
四月的第一天迎来了播种的日子。尽管冬天异常寒冷，却仿佛开关一拨就结束了。三月十二日最后一场雪后，白天气温迅速回升至 13 度，夜间则降至约 8 度。惠美在图书馆翻阅了近十年 20 世纪的历书后，决定现在是时候开始种植耐寒作物了。

Asuka, Linda, and now Nazli were exempted from the planting. They stayed together at Lindas house each helping take care of Jason and keeping Linda company. Asuka had begun getting tired in the early afternoon recently, and had found that the need to use the restroom every 10 minutes, maybe 5 minutes, was quickly growing wearisome.  
明日香、琳达和纳兹莉被免除了种植任务。她们一起待在琳达家，各自帮忙照顾杰森并陪伴琳达。最近，明日香在下午早些时候就开始感到疲倦，而且每隔十分钟，甚至五分钟就需要去一次洗手间，这让她很快感到厌烦。

Out in the fields, Megumi and Klaus spent most of the first day getting the pivot arm up and working. This device, properly maintained, could till, plant, irrigate and harvest a field with any number of crops. A makeshift greenhouse set up in the Collection Point warehouse had produced thousands of cabbage, carrot, lettuce, onion, potato, radish, and spinach sprouts. The remaining men and women were bringing trays of these by the hundreds.  
在田野里，惠和克劳斯大部分时间都在第一天忙着搭建和调试旋转臂。这个设备，只要维护得当，就能耕作、播种、灌溉和收获多种作物的田地。在收集点的仓库里搭建了一个临时温室，已经培育出了成千上万颗卷心菜、胡萝卜、生菜、洋葱、土豆、萝卜和菠菜的幼苗。剩下的男女们正成百上千地运送着这些托盘。

Tonight would be a long night watching the pivot device work, Megumi still did not trust it completely, but if all went well, they would have planted the first 40 acre field in the next 24 hours, and in a few weeks or months depending on the crop, they would have all the fresh vegetables they could eat. In a couple of weeks, when it was nearly certain that the last of the frost we behind them, other crops would be planted also.  
今晚将是一个漫长的夜晚，观察旋转设备的工作，惠仍然不完全信任它，但如果一切顺利，他们将在接下来的 24 小时内种植第一块 40 英亩的田地，几周或几个月后，根据作物的不同，他们将拥有吃不完的新鲜蔬菜。再过几周，当几乎可以确定最后的霜冻已经过去时，其他作物也将开始种植。

The pivot arm device was a marvel of engineering. It had evolved from the simple irrigation devices used for decades to a more modern and capable machine in the last ten years. A leading plowshare could dig a furrow, a hopper and several arms along a chute could guide the sprouting plant down into the hole right side up, and a couple of disks would be along a few seconds later to fill in the hole just neat as you please. Drive wheels sat at increasingly narrow intervals as one approached the outside end of the arm. These electrically powered drives would push the whole arm, about 650 feet, along the circular path.  
枢轴臂装置堪称工程奇迹。它从几十年前简单的灌溉设备演变为近十年来更为现代、功能更强大的机器。前端的犁头能挖出沟槽，料斗和几条滑槽上的臂杆引导萌芽的植株正立地落入坑中，随后几片圆盘会在几秒钟后将坑填得整整齐齐。驱动轮随着向臂端外侧靠近，间隔逐渐变窄。这些电力驱动的轮子推动整个约 650 英尺长的臂杆沿圆形轨迹移动。

While it saved a huge amount of time in labor in the field, it was not without fault. Being mechanical, it could break down, it had failure rate of maybe 3% leaving those plants squashed, buried, cut apart or lying on top of the dirt useless, and finally it required manual retooling. Once the planting was done, the planting apparatus had to be disconnected, stored and replaced with the fertilizing and irrigation attachments. This was by far much less work, however. Where the group of them could probably plant the 40 acre field in a week or two, this could accomplish it (probably with a similar error rate) in a day. And come harvest time, a similar time frame would be saved by the arm.  
尽管它在田间劳作中节省了大量时间，但并非没有缺陷。作为机械装置，它可能会出现故障，故障率可能达到 3%，导致那些植物被压扁、掩埋、切割或无用地躺在泥土上，最后还需要手动重新调整。种植完成后，种植装置必须被拆卸、储存，并替换为施肥和灌溉附件。不过，这相对来说工作量要小得多。他们一群人可能需要一周或两周才能种完这 40 英亩的田地，而这个装置一天内就能完成（可能错误率相似）。到了收获季节，同样的装置也能节省大量时间。

It was during the last load of the day that Shinji finally managed to ride with Sameer. He had been unable to talk with Sameer alone since the announcement of Nazlis pregnancy.  
就在这天最后一趟时，真嗣终于有机会和萨米尔一起骑行。自从纳兹莉怀孕的消息宣布后，他一直没能和萨米尔单独交谈。

"Congratulations, Sameer, I was happy to hear about your baby!" Shinji gave Sameer a good slap on the back.  
“恭喜你，萨米尔，听说你要当爸爸了，我真为你高兴！”真嗣用力拍了拍萨米尔的背。

"Yes! I am amazed, my friend. I have never felt blessed before, but now I am. My head is in the clouds!" Sameer's smile, which had not disappeared for more than a moment since he had told everyone was radiant now, beaming back at Shinji. "You and Asuka are going to have yours soon too! They can all grow up together! It will be good to have others the same age."  
“太好了！我真是惊喜万分，朋友。我从未觉得自己如此幸运，但现在我感受到了。我仿佛飘在云端！”自从告诉了大家这个消息，萨梅尔的笑容就未曾消失过，此刻更是灿烂地照耀着真嗣。“你和明日香也很快会有自己的孩子的！他们可以一起长大！同龄人相伴成长，真是太好了。”

Shinji was fascinated at how Sameer was looking ahead like this. Shinji had scarcely considered that the children would have many potential playmates or even that they would play together. This realization struck him hard. Was he ready to be a father? He had no idea what he was getting himself into. He was just making this stuff up as he went along! Was he ready to dedicate a significant portion of his life (more even than he had already lived) to preparing and teaching and raising another person?  
真嗣对萨梅尔这样展望未来感到着迷。他几乎没考虑过孩子们会有许多潜在的玩伴，甚至他们会一起玩耍。这个认识让他深受触动。他准备好成为一个父亲了吗？他完全不知道自己即将面对什么。他只是在边走边摸索！他准备好将生命中的一大段时间（甚至超过他已经度过的岁月）投入到准备、教导和抚养另一个生命中吗？

He had not been afraid for a long time now. He had left most of his fears with his former life, and he had stepped into his role as a companion for Asuka, and a leader of this community with a sureness that an earlier Shinji would never have recognized, but now he wondered, fretted, and feared. It was not the icy tendrils of horrified fear, or even the overwhelming fear that blots out thought and keeps you frozen in your tracks, watching a truck bear down on you. This was a fear of trepidation. You know something difficult, and dangerous, is coming, but you have to wait, and the waiting fear gnaws at you, stealing a bit of you each day.  
他已经很久没有感到害怕了。他把大部分的恐惧留在了过去的生活中，带着一种早年的真嗣绝不会认出的坚定，踏入了作为明日香伴侣和这个社区领导者的角色。但现在，他感到担忧、焦虑和恐惧。这不是那种冰冷的、令人毛骨悚然的恐惧，也不是那种压倒性的、让你思维停滞、僵在原地，眼睁睁看着卡车向你冲来的恐惧。这是一种忐忑不安的恐惧。你知道即将面临困难和危险，但你只能等待，而等待中的恐惧不断啃噬着你，每天都在偷走你的一部分。

"…alright?" Shinji snapped back to reality. Sameer was looking at him with interest, that gaze that wondered "Did you hear me? Are you thinking?"  
“……没事吧？”真嗣猛地回过神来。萨米尔正饶有兴趣地看着他，那种眼神仿佛在问：“你听到了吗？你在想什么？”

"Sorry, Sameer, I was just thinking. What did you say, again?"  
“抱歉，萨米尔，我刚才在想事情。你刚才说什么了？”

"I just asked if you are alright. You are pale like you saw a ghost." Sameer was still driving, but they were almost back to the fields with the last of the equipment and seedlings and sprouts.  
"我只是问你是不是还好。你脸色苍白得像见了鬼似的。" Sameer 还在开车，但他们已经快回到田里了，那里有最后一批设备、秧苗和幼芽。

"Sameer, have you ever been afraid of something, maybe something you had never done before?"  
"Sameer，你有没有害怕过什么，或许是一些你从未做过的事情？"

"I have been, afraid! Yes! My father died when I was 13. He and I had been getting by for a while after my mother died in Second Impact. When he died, I had nowhere to go. I had no money, I had nothing that I could do. For a while, I scraped by, but I was always afraid. Where would I get food? Where could I get clean water? What if I got sick?  
"我有过，害怕！是的！我父亲在我 13 岁时去世了。母亲在第二次冲击中去世后，我和他相依为命了一段时间。他去世后，我无处可去。我没有钱，我什么都不会做。有一阵子，我勉强维持生计，但我总是害怕。我该去哪里找食物？哪里能找到干净的水？万一我生病了怎么办？

"I lived on the street for a few months trying to figure out what to do and one day I walked by a construction site and there was a man calling for people to help. I said I would work and they paid me cash to carry tools and materials to people building a tall building. Now I had some money, but I was scared each morning when I started my job. I walked on ten centimeter steel all day, and I nearly fell a few times. I was scared a lot then."  
"我在街上流浪了几个月，试图弄清楚该做什么。有一天，我路过一个建筑工地，看到一个男子在招呼人帮忙。我说我愿意工作，他们付我现金，让我搬运工具和材料给那些建造高楼的人。现在我有了一些钱，但每天早上开始工作时，我都感到害怕。我整天走在十厘米宽的钢梁上，有好几次差点摔下来。那段时间我真的很害怕。"

"But I found out that I could do it. I could find food, I could find water, I could find shelter, and I could make do when working. I was still scared a little, but it was not so bad. What are you scared of, Shinji?" These last few sentences threatened to turn into run-ons as sometimes happened when Sameer started really talking.  
"但我发现我能做到。我能找到食物，能找到水，能找到住处，工作时也能应付自如。我还是有点害怕，但没那么糟糕了。你害怕什么呢，真嗣？" 这几句话差点变成了长篇大论，每当萨米尔真正开始说话时，这种情况时有发生。"

"Being a parent, I guess. I can't be responsible for someone like that. I'm not ready for that kind of thing."  
"我想，是成为父母吧。我无法承担那样的责任。我还没准备好面对那种事情。"

The incredulous look that was directed at him was almost comical. Sameer had a habit of wearing his emotions right out in the open, and so Shinji knew that he really couldn't believe what he was hearing. "Shinji, you are the most responsible person I know. You piloted huge robots and fought whatever they were. You survived for a year on your own and sailed halfway around the world twice. I think you can do anything."  
那难以置信的眼神投向他，几乎带着喜剧色彩。Sameer 有个习惯，总是毫不掩饰地表露自己的情绪，因此 Shinji 知道他真的无法相信自己所听到的话。“Shinji，你是我认识的最有责任感的人。你驾驶着巨大的机器人，与那些未知的存在战斗。你独自生存了一年，两次横渡半个世界。我想你无所不能。”

The compliments made him smile and went a long way toward calming his fears. They were well subdued by the time they had finally arrived at field number one. He thought about voicing his fears to Asuka later, but at the same time he didn't want to worry her.  
这些赞美让他微笑，大大缓解了他的恐惧。当他们终于到达一号场地时，这些恐惧已被很好地压制住了。他考虑过后向 Asuka 表达自己的担忧，但同时又不希望让她担心。

They unpacked the last of the trays of sprouting vegetables, and then the whole group watched and waited as the machine finally started operation. The squealing and complaining metal components soon quieted as the lubrication worked its way into joints. After a few minutes, the rambling, rolling machine was quietly and methodically plowing, planting, covering, without a sound of protest. The soft whir of the electric motors driving the 650 ft arm was the only sound that broke the otherwise silent day. The group walked up and down the arm, watching the process go.  
他们拆开了最后一盘发芽蔬菜，随后整个团队便注视着，等待着机器最终启动运行。随着润滑油渗入关节，那些吱吱作响、抱怨连连的金属部件很快安静下来。几分钟后，这台庞大而复杂的机器便悄无声息、有条不紊地进行着犁地、播种、覆土的工作，未发出一丝抗议之声。唯有驱动着 650 英尺长臂的电动马达发出轻柔的嗡鸣，打破了这寂静的日间氛围。团队成员沿着长臂来回走动，观察着整个过程的进行。

The far end of the arm was rapidly planting its hopper of sprouts, so new trays were brought up. Pretty soon they had worked out a system where they could resupply the hoppers without letting them run out, and at the same time without running themselves ragged. Shinji and most of the others went home for a few hours; they would be back later to relieve the crew who were staying now, and still others would be back after that to relieve them. Planting of this first field would take hours even at the rate at which it was going, so best to keep up their strength. Megumi and a couple of others would sleep in their cars that night and keep an eye on things.  
机械臂的远端正迅速播种着幼苗，于是新的托盘被不断送上。不久，他们便摸索出一套系统，既能及时补充播种仓，又不至于让自己筋疲力尽。真嗣和其他大多数人回家休息了几个小时；他们稍后会回来接替现在留守的人员，而其他人之后也会回来轮换。即便以目前的速度，这片田地的种植工作仍需数小时才能完成，因此保持体力至关重要。惠美和另外几个人将在当晚睡在车里，并时刻留意情况。

---

A few days later ended up being the last frost of the winter. The planting had gone pretty well with an estimated efficiency somewhere around 90%. Megumi was kind of angry about that but accepted the compliments of everyone who offered them. Shinji had told her that the amount of vegetables that they were going to harvest would likely be several times more than they would be able to eat. The 10% loss would probably never be felt or noticed.  
几天后，冬天的最后一波霜冻终于结束。种植进展相当顺利，估计效率达到了约 90%。惠美对此有些恼火，但还是接受了大家的好评。真嗣告诉她，他们即将收获的蔬菜数量可能是他们能吃掉的几倍。那 10%的损失或许永远不会被察觉或感受到。

Along with the gardens, Megumi was also raising animals to keep some meat, milk and eggs in their diet. It had not been long after she had started rounding up chickens that they found the egg production was far outpacing their ability to eat the eggs. Milk was proving a bit more difficult to come by at the moment, but with a new batch of calves about to be born, they would have a lot in a few months. Shinji wondered if he would have any time for cooking. They would, hopefully, have food in abundance, they would have supplies to help stave off nearly any foreseeable mishaps or disasters, they would have a community that would step up to any challenge. At the same time, they would have children. They would be vulnerable. They had huge amounts of work ahead of them.  
除了花园，惠美还在饲养动物，以确保他们的饮食中有肉类、牛奶和鸡蛋。自从她开始围捕鸡群后不久，他们就发现鸡蛋的产量远远超过了他们的食用能力。牛奶目前获取起来有些困难，但随着新一批小牛即将出生，几个月后他们将拥有大量牛奶。真嗣不知道自己是否还有时间烹饪。希望他们能有充足的食物，有足够的物资来抵御几乎任何可预见的意外或灾难，有一个能应对任何挑战的社区。与此同时，他们还将有孩子。他们将是脆弱的。他们面前有大量的工作。

He supposed there was little in the way of free time for a while, but that was alright. Looking out over the first planted field, he felt proud. The homes, the Collection Point, the fields, the hospital. They had created this. They had toiled and now here it was starting to come to fruition.  
他猜想暂时没有什么空闲时间，但这没关系。望着第一片播种的田野，他感到自豪。那些家园、收集点、田地、医院。他们创造了这一切。他们辛勤劳作，如今这一切正逐渐成为现实。

---

That night Shinji dreamed. He'd had a number of very realistic dreams since he woke up on the beach; some of them were scary, some of them were not. This time he found himself in the hazy vignette of the future. He saw Asuka giving birth to their daughter. They named her Itsuki because she was born in the late spring, a little early. She had her mother's red hair and reached and flailed and slept.  
那一夜，真嗣做梦了。自从他在海滩上醒来后，他经历了许多非常真实的梦境；有些令人恐惧，有些则不然。这一次，他发现自己置身于一个模糊的未来片段中。他看到明日香生下了他们的女儿。他们给她取名 Itsuki，因为她出生在晚春时节，稍微早了一些。她继承了母亲的红色头发，伸手、挥舞、然后睡着了。

Then they were harvesting. The crop was bountiful. They had eggs and milk, meat, vegetables, and even some fruit. They repaired and returned to service another wind generator. Itsuki reached for things and grabbed her own feet and rolled over.  
接着他们在收割。收成非常丰富。他们有鸡蛋、牛奶、肉类、蔬菜，甚至还有一些水果。他们修复并重新启用了另一台风力发电机。Itsuki 伸手去抓东西，抓住自己的脚，然后翻了个身。

Further into the future he went, now it was Sameer and Nazli who were having their son. They named him Nashwan, and he had a full head of black hair. In another room, someone was sick, it looked like Renee. She lay her head to the side and stared out the window with drooping eyes. Her chapped lips had a scrim of vomit which she tried to wipe away. Danysa was beside her taking her pulse and worrying over her.  
他继续深入未来，现在是 Sameer 和 Nazli 有了他们的儿子。他们给他取名 Nashwan，他有一头浓密的黑发。在另一个房间里，有人生病了，看起来像是 Renee。她把头侧向一边，眼睛下垂地望着窗外。她干裂的嘴唇上有一层呕吐物的痕迹，她试图擦掉。Danysa 在她旁边，为她把脉，担忧地照顾着她。

Further on he flew, the future spreading out below him like a valley from the top of a mountain. The fields of everyday happenings being broken by the fences and houses of life changing events. Itsuki started walking, and soon after started talking. She was feeding herself, then she was dressing herself. She hunched over a book and traced her finger over the writing doing her best to read her first story all by herself. Soon she was writing and playing dolls, she was helping him repair a pump and she was helping her mother with the sets for the school play.  
他继续飞翔，未来在他脚下铺展开来，宛如山巅俯瞰的谷地。日常琐事的田野被生命转折的事件栅栏和房屋所打破。Itsuki 开始行走，不久便开始说话。她自己进食，自己穿衣。她弓身对着一本书，用手指沿着文字描摹，竭尽全力独自阅读她的第一个故事。很快，她开始写字、玩偶，帮助他修理水泵，协助母亲为学校戏剧准备布景。

While all of this happened at the same time he saw the lives of the others of the community speeding ahead of him. Jason and Nashwan in matching head to toe flour. Nashwan yelling at James and Fennas daughter Natalie for stealing his favorite toy car after he set it down and walked away from it. The excited first radio contact with the people they had left behind in Germany after the completion of the VLF antenna array. The dits and dahs of morse code sounding out the trials and achievements of both camps, and the renewed promise that they were worried for the other and that if there was a way they could be of help, they would, although there was an unspoken agreement that they would not join with the other.  
与此同时，他目睹了社区中其他人生活在他面前飞速展开。杰森和纳什万全身沾满面粉，如出一辙。纳什万对着詹姆斯和芬纳斯的女儿娜塔莉大喊大叫，指责他们偷走了他放下并走开后心爱的玩具车。在 VLF 天线阵列完工后，他们首次与留在德国的人们进行了激动人心的无线电联络。摩尔斯电码的嘀嗒声传递着双方经历的考验与成就，以及他们为对方担忧并承诺若有办法提供帮助，定会伸出援手，尽管双方心照不宣地同意不会合流。

Asuka taught a history class in school, and did her best to impress on the children that the world had been rife with mistakes, and that they had a chance to keep from perpetuating those mistakes. Itsuki wanted badly to play football (soccer) and baseball, and was angry at both of her parents that she lived in a world with so few people. Itsuke ran away from home for a few days and made a few realizations about the world that she lived in, and the people in it. When she returned home, they all picked up like nothing had happened, and she was grateful for that.  
明日香在学校教授历史课，她竭尽全力让孩子们明白，这个世界充满了错误，而他们有机会避免重蹈覆辙。Itsuki 非常渴望踢足球和打棒球，她对父母感到愤怒，因为她生活在一个人口稀少的世界。Itsuke 离家出走了几天，对所生活的世界和其中的人们有了一些领悟。当她回家时，一切仿佛从未发生过，她对此心存感激。

Further and faster he was involuntarily flung, speeding along, but at the same time understanding the full depth of every moment and the story that was flowing around him. He knew the names and the circumstances behind every person and every event. Finally he came to a sunny grassy lawn with tables arrayed in rows. There was a small multitude of people there nearly a hundred. He knew that James and Fenna were long gone, as were most of the original members of this community. Their children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren were calling him up on a platform to speak. Everyone was having dinner. They were eating food that they had raised, on benches and tables they had built, using knowledge they had taught each other.  
他不由自主地被抛得更远、更快，疾驰而行，同时却深刻理解着每一刻的全部内涵以及围绕他展开的故事。他熟知每个人的名字和每件事背后的情境。最终，他来到了一片阳光明媚的草坪，那里整齐排列着一排排桌子。近百人聚集于此。他知道，詹姆斯和芬娜早已离去，大部分原始社区成员亦是如此。他们的子孙后代，甚至曾孙辈，正邀请他登上讲台发言。众人正在用餐，享用着他们亲手种植的食物，坐在他们亲手打造的板凳和桌子上，运用着彼此传授的知识。

He watched himself squeeze Asukas hand as he push on the cane that he now went everywhere with. Slowly he stood, tall and thin, he had mottled skin that held years of wrinkles, but his back was straight. He held out his hand and took Asukas to help her up, and together they made their way up the short ramp to the platform where Itsuki stood, old herself, with tears in her eyes and a smile, beaming to them the gratitude that she would soon tell everyone else about. It had been 84 years since they had awoken on a beach, had found love, had found other people, and hand founded a community.  
他看着自己紧握着明日香的手，拄着那根如今走到哪儿都离不开的手杖。他缓缓站起身，瘦削而高挑，皮肤斑驳，皱纹满布，但背脊挺直。他伸出手，牵起明日香的手助她起身，两人一同缓缓走上通往平台的短坡，那里站着已经老去的 Itsuki，眼中含泪，笑容灿烂，向他们传递着即将向众人表达的感激之情。自他们在海滩上醒来，找到爱情，找到其他人，并亲手建立了一个社区，已经过去了 84 年。

Seeing himself and Asuka making their slow way in front of everyone for their 100th year (they had split the difference between birthdays) he knew deep inside that all would be well and all would be well and all manner of things would be well. Their children would grow and prosper, their hard work would pay off, and they would slowly bring the human race back from the brink and they might even lay the foundation for the future society that he hoped they would become.  
看着自己和明日香在众人面前缓缓前行，庆祝他们的百岁生日（他们将两个生日取了平均），他内心深处明白，一切都会好起来，一切都会好起来，一切都会好起来。他们的孩子将成长繁荣，他们的辛勤工作将得到回报，他们将慢慢将人类从濒临灭绝的边缘带回，甚至可能为未来社会奠定基础，这是他所希望他们能成为的样子。

**Epilogue 尾声**

Itsuki was 4 years old when she started playing with her first imaginary friend. He was a bit shorter than she was and didn't talk much, but that was fine with her. They would explore the forest behind their house, he would go with her, when she peeked at her parents when they went to the river sometimes at night. He was with her the day she nearly fell out of the tree where she was trying to build her tree fort with some wood she had gathered.  
Itsuki 四岁时开始与她的第一个想象中的朋友玩耍。他比她矮一点，话不多，但这对她来说无所谓。他们会一起探索房子后面的森林，当她晚上偷偷看父母去河边时，他也会陪着她。那天她差点从树上掉下来，当时她正试图用收集来的木头在树上搭建树屋。

More than anything else, though he was with her when she got tired, and when she got in trouble, and when she was frustrated. He was the one she could confide in, and tell secrets to, and be mischievous with.  
最重要的是，无论她何时感到疲惫、遇到麻烦或感到沮丧，他都在她身边。她是她可以倾诉、分享秘密和一起调皮捣蛋的人。

Sometimes if she was crying or if she needed a hug and she couldn't get to mommy or daddy, she would turn to him, and nestle her face into his tiny feathers and hug him tightly and tell him, "I love you, Pen-Pen." And that would make everything right.  
有时如果她哭了，或者需要一个拥抱却无法找到爸爸妈妈时，她会转向他，将脸埋进他那小小的羽毛里，紧紧拥抱他，并告诉他：“我爱你，Pen-Pen。”这让她感到一切都会好起来。

Authors note: 作者的话：

Now, I know some of you will be pissed off by what seems like an abrupt ending. I had actually toyed with the idea of having Shinji grow fearful of the potential failure of what he was trying to do only to be reassured through a dream of the future at the end. I had thought about it for a long time. And really, why not?  
现在，我知道你们中的一些人会对这种看似突兀的结局感到不满。我其实考虑过让真嗣对可能的失败感到恐惧，最后通过一个关于未来的梦来得到安慰。我对此思考了很久。真的，为什么不呢？

How many of us, when we are vulnerable or unsure, would like to have someone, something tell us that it will all turn out alright? Is the dream what really happens? Could be. The optimist in me says that it is. They worked hard damnit, and Americans are belabored by the idea that hard work will win out, that your sweat and toil will end in your being in a better situation than you were when you started. We get discouraged sometimes when that doesn't happen or when you look ahead and see just how much work is involved.  
我们中有多少人，在脆弱或不确定时，希望能有人或某种东西告诉我们一切都会好起来？那个梦真的会发生吗？可能是的。我内心的乐观主义者说会的。他们努力了，该死的，美国人深受努力工作终将胜出的观念影响，认为你的汗水和辛劳会让你处于比开始时更好的境地。有时，当这种情况没有发生，或者当你展望未来，看到还有多少工作要做时，我们会感到沮丧。

This ending has been a long time coming, and while it might seem rushed, I think it was just about right. The story started with in depth detail of single days spread out sometimes by weeks and months, culminating in a series of chapters that all took place within about three weeks, then spread out again to allow the community to grow beyond the things they had rescued from decay (the homes and buildings and machinery and such) into a group of people who were making for themselves a bright and hopefully plentiful future.  
这个结局酝酿已久，尽管可能显得仓促，但我认为恰到好处。故事从对单日的深入细节描写开始，有时跨越数周或数月，最终汇聚成一系列章节，这些章节都发生在约三周内，然后再次展开，让社区从他们从衰败中拯救出来的事物（房屋、建筑、机械等）中成长，成为一个为自己创造光明且充满希望的未来的群体。

I am one of those people who sees the value in dark stories, but doesn't really like them. I enjoy having stories where the characters overcome the obstacles that are put before them and prevail against the forces of darkness. So naturally I wrote a story where there were a few obstacles, the characters overcame them, found some love, made some life and became better people.  
我是那种欣赏黑暗故事价值，但并不真正喜欢它们的人。我喜欢那些角色克服摆在面前的障碍，战胜黑暗力量的故事。因此，我自然写了一个故事，其中有几个障碍，角色们克服了它们，找到了一些爱，创造了生活，并成为了更好的人。

Eventually, I would like to move on to my next project: a fiction that is wholly mine. I have some ideas that are kicking around up there, and are itching to make their way to the page. We'll see if I ever get the time to do it. In the mean-time, stay well, be the person your 12 year old self wanted you to be, and don't give up on the things that keep you pushing ahead.  
最终，我希望能着手下一个项目：一部完全属于我的小说。我脑海中有些想法一直在打转，迫切想要跃然纸上。看看我是否能抽出时间来实现它吧。在此期间，愿你安好，成为 12 岁时的自己所期望的那个人，并且不要放弃那些让你不断前进的事物。

Be Excellent to Each Other, and you know the rest.  
彼此善待，剩下的你懂的。
