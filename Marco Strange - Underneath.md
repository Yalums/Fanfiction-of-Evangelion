### Chapter 1
Shinji was currently trying to get some sleep. Tomorrow, he and Asuka would get another chance at defeating the Angel. All they had to do was work together for once, but that was easier said than done. He had his eyes close as he laid on his side.  
真嗣此刻正试图入睡。明天，他和明日香将再次有机会击败使徒。他们只需要这一次合作，但说起来容易做起来难。他闭上眼睛，侧身躺着。

"Once this angel is defeated, we can stop being stuck together." Shinji sighed. "What even are the Walls of Jericho that she talked about?"  
"一旦打败这个天使，我们就能不再被束缚在一起了。" 真嗣叹了口气。"她说的耶利哥之墙到底是什么？"

Even after trying for so long, Shinji was unable to fall asleep. He didn't know if he was nervous or if it was one of the many nights he had trouble sleeping, but it annoyed him either way. His focus changed, though, when he heard someone lay down next to him.  
即使尝试了这么久，真嗣还是无法入睡。他不知道自己是紧张还是这只是又一个难以入眠的夜晚，但无论如何都让他感到烦躁。然而，当听到有人躺在他旁边时，他的注意力转移了。

"What the..." He slowly opened his eyes and jumped backward. In front of him was a sleeping Asuka. He sweated as he kept staring at her. "_What in the world is she doing next to me!? I thought she didn't want to be asleep next to me tonight!_"  
"什么鬼..." 他缓缓睁开眼睛，向后一跳。眼前是熟睡的明日香。他一边盯着她，一边冒汗。"她到底在我旁边做什么！？我以为她今晚不想和我一起睡！"

As he was looking at her, he couldn't help but look down at her loose t-shirt. He blushed as he realized Asuka would kill him if she knew he was doing that. He lifted his eyes back to her face, hearing her talking. Luckily, it looked like she was still asleep. He couldn't help but move closer as he thought about kissing her. He couldn't explain why, but he wanted to kiss her while she was in front of him. He slowly leaned in forward as he kept thinking about...  
当他看着她时，目光不由自主地落在了她宽松的 T 恤上。意识到如果明日香知道他在这么做，肯定会杀了他，他的脸颊泛起了红晕。他抬起眼睛回到她的脸上，听着她说话。幸运的是，看起来她还在熟睡。他忍不住向她靠近，心中想着要吻她。他无法解释为什么，但当她就在眼前时，他渴望吻她。他一边想着，一边慢慢地向前倾身...

"M..." Asuka mumbled, making Shinji stop in his tracks. "Mo...Momma..."  
“妈...”明日香喃喃自语，让真嗣停下了动作。“妈...妈妈...”

"Momma?" Shinji raised an eyebrow as he kept looking at her. He jumped as he saw her starting to cry. Before he could react, Asuka rolled to her side.  
“妈妈？”真嗣挑起眉毛，继续看着她。看到她开始哭泣，他吓了一跳。还没等他反应过来，明日香已经翻身侧躺了。

"Momma..." Asuka wept as she faced the other direction. "Why did you leave me, Momma? I need you. I don't have anyone else, momma."  
"妈妈..." 明日香转向另一边哭泣着。"为什么你要离开我，妈妈？我需要你。我没有其他人了，妈妈。"

Shinji gulped as he watched Asuka in her current state. He knew her as overconfident and not afraid of anything. Now he was watching her cry for her mother like a toddler. He couldn't explain why, but he put his arm over her and curled up to her.  
真嗣咽了口唾沫，看着此刻的明日香。他认识的她总是自信满满，无所畏惧。现在他却看到她像个幼儿一样为母亲哭泣。他说不出为什么，但还是伸出手臂搂住她，蜷缩在她身边。

"It's okay." He whispered as he leaned into her ear. "You're not alone."  
"没事的。" 他贴近她的耳朵轻声说。"你并不孤单。"

Asuka started to calm down after Shinji put his arm around her. Shinji could still hear her silently weeping, but he sighed as he saw her sleeping like normal. Without realizing he, Shinji was finally drifting off to sleep.  
在真嗣搂住她之后，明日香开始平静下来。真嗣仍能听到她在默默哭泣，但看到她像往常一样睡着了，他叹了口气。不知不觉中，真嗣也终于渐渐进入了梦乡。

The next day, Shinji rubbed his eyes as he started to wake up.  
第二天，真嗣揉着眼睛开始醒来。

"Man, that was some dream." Shinji slowly opened his eyes and jumped back. He saw Asuka still in front of him. Just like the night before. "So that wasn't a dream then."  
“天啊，那真是个梦。”真嗣缓缓睁开眼睛，猛地向后一跳。他看到明日香仍在他面前。就像昨晚一样。“这么说那不是梦。”

As Shinji looked down at Asuka. A million things were going through his head. He didn't know how to explain to Asuka why she was there, let alone why he was curled up to her like that. Thankfully she was still asleep, but she'd probably be wondering how she went from one room to another. He then looked at the clock and realized it was earlier than they were supposed to get up.  
当真嗣低头看着明日香时，他的脑海中闪过无数念头。他不知道该如何向明日香解释她为何在那里，更别说他为何会那样蜷缩在她身边。幸好她还在熟睡，但她大概会疑惑自己是怎么从一间房到了另一间的。他随后看了看时钟，意识到时间比他们应该起床的时间还要早。

"What in the world am I supposed to do?" He sighed as he knew it would be over an hour before they'd be picked up. He looked back over at Asuka and saw she was still asleep. Right now, his stomach was growling, and figured that he wouldn't be able to go back to sleep. He went to the kitchen and started making himself something to eat. Since he just wanted anything, he had a bowl of cereal. As he ate, he couldn't get what he saw last night out of his head. "Was that the real Asuka I saw last night?"  
“我到底该怎么办？”他叹了口气，知道还要过上一个多小时才会有人来接他们。他回头看向明日香，见她仍在熟睡。此刻，他的肚子咕咕叫，心想自己大概是睡不着了。他走进厨房，开始给自己弄点吃的。既然只想随便吃点什么，他便盛了一碗麦片。吃着吃着，昨晚看到的情景始终挥之不去。“昨晚我看到的是真正的明日香吗？”

Shinji was still thinking about what he should do about what he saw. If he tried talking to Asuka, chances are she'd kill him or just deny it. If he tried telling Misato, Asuka would do the same thing. Part of him started to feel bad thinking that Asuka is like him and feels alone. He finished his cereal and looked back at the clock.  
真嗣还在思考该如何处理他所看到的事情。如果他试图和明日香谈谈，她很可能会杀了他或者干脆否认。如果他告诉美里，明日香也会做出同样的事情。他的一部分开始感到难过，认为明日香和他一样，感到孤独。他吃完麦片，回头看了看时钟。

"Well, I have a lot of time to kill anyway." He stood up and walked to a cupboard.  
“好吧，反正我有很多时间可以消磨。”他站起来，走向一个橱柜。

After some time, Asuka was awoken by the smell of something good. She sat up and rubbed her eyes. She jumped up as she saw where she was.  
过了一会儿，明日香被某种好闻的味道唤醒。她坐起来揉了揉眼睛。当她看到自己在哪里时，她跳了起来。

"Why the hell am I in here!?" Asuka stomped as she went looking for Shinji. "You baka! You better have a good explanation for..."  
"我到底为什么会在这里！？" 明日香一边跺脚一边寻找真嗣。"你这个笨蛋！最好有个像样的解释……"

"Good morning, Asuka." Shinji smiled as he sat a plate down at the table. I woke up early and thought I'd make you breakfast."  
"早上好，明日香。" 真嗣微笑着将一盘食物放在桌上。"我早起了一会儿，想着给你做早餐。"

"You..." Asuka froze as she looked at him and the plate. "You made me that for breakfast?"  
"你……" 明日香看着他和那盘食物，愣住了。"你为我做了这个当早餐？"

"I heard from Kaji awhile ago that you loved waffles. It's my first attempt at trying them, but I thought you'd love some for our fight today."  
"我之前听阿基说你喜欢吃华夫饼。这是我第一次尝试做，但我想你今天会喜欢在战斗中吃点。"

Asuka approached closer and saw what he made for her. There were two homemade waffles, topped with strawberry syrup and fresh-cut strawberries.  
明日香走近一看，发现他为她做了什么。那是两块自制的华夫饼，上面淋着草莓糖浆，还点缀着新鲜切片的草莓。

"You did all this for me?" Asuka stared at the plate. "Even though you're supposed to be focused on the battle?"  
"你为我做了这一切？" 明日香盯着盘子。"即使你应该专注于战斗？"

"Well, I wanted you to be 100 percent and wanted to show I'm happy that we're fighting together."  
"嗯，我希望你能全力以赴，也想表达我很高兴我们能并肩作战。"

"How did you even have a waffle maker to make these?"  
"你哪来的华夫饼机做这些？"

"Misato had it laying around." Shinji giggled. "I just thought it was time to break it out."  
"美里把它放在一边了。" 真嗣咯咯笑道。"我只是觉得是时候拿出来用了。"

Asuka stood there, unsure what to say. She could indeed get whatever she wanted, but no one ever treated her the same way Shinji was. They've spent the last few days usually fighting, and now he's making breakfast and telling her he wants her by his side.  
明日香站在那里，不知该说什么。她的确可以得到任何想要的东西，但没有人像真嗣这样对待她。过去几天他们通常在争吵，而现在他却在做早餐，告诉她希望她在他身边。

"Well, that's great that you did that!" Asuka grinned as she crossed her arms. "Of course, an ace pilot like myself wouldn't need this, but I appreciate the thought that went into it!"  
"嗯，你这么做真是太好了！" 明日香咧嘴一笑，双臂交叉。"当然，像我这样的王牌飞行员不需要这个，但我很感激你的用心！"

"I'm happy to hear that." Shinji continued to smile, making Asuka shocked. He expected him to roll his eyes at her like usual.  
"听到这个我很高兴。" 真嗣继续微笑，这让明日香感到震惊。他本以为他会像往常一样对她翻白眼。

"Well, I still need to brush my teeth either way." Asuka turned away and walked to the bathroom. "Don't you dare think about eating my waffles either, baka!"  
"反正我还是得刷牙。" 明日香转身走向浴室。"你敢打我华夫饼的主意试试，笨蛋！"

"I won't." Asuka took one last look and saw he was still smiling. She just kept walking to the bathroom and quickly closed the door. She then started brushing her teeth.  
"我不会的。" 明日香最后看了一眼，发现他还在微笑。她继续走向浴室，迅速关上门，然后开始刷牙。

"_What in the world is going on with him?_" Asuka looked at herself in the mirror. "_Why did he put all this effort into making me happy? I thought he hated me and was annoyed with our situation._"  
“他到底是怎么回事？”明日香对着镜子中的自己问道，“为什么他费尽心思让我开心？我以为他讨厌我，对我们这种情况感到厌烦。”

Once Asuka brushed her teeth, she rinsed out her mouth and took one last look in the mirror.  
当明日香刷完牙后，她漱了漱口，最后一次对着镜子看了看自己。

"Whatever it is, I'm not going to pass up a tasty breakfast." She smiled as she turned and walked back to the kitchen. "_Hopefully, that baka listened and didn't eat any of my waffles._"  
“不管是什么，我都不会错过美味的早餐。”她笑着转身走回厨房。“希望那个笨蛋听话，没有吃掉我的华夫饼。”

As Asuka walked back in, she saw the waffles were still there, and Shinji was now in the living room. Asuka decided to ask him about it later and eat her breakfast. She sat down and began cutting off a piece of a waffle. She put it in her mouth and almost screamed in joy from how good it tasted. She continued to eat it until it was completely gone.  
当明日香走回来时，她看到华夫饼还在那里，而真嗣现在在客厅。明日香决定稍后再问他，先享用早餐。她坐下来，开始切下一块华夫饼。她把它放进嘴里，差点因为它的美味而欢呼出声。她继续吃，直到完全吃完。

### Chapter 2
"_Come on, kids._" Misato watched on and smiled. "_I don't know why, but those two are working together perfectly._"  
"快点，孩子们。" 美里看着他们，微笑着。"我不知道为什么，但那两个人配合得天衣无缝。"

During the fight, Shinji and Asuka were perfectly in synch. If Misato didn't know better, she would believe they'd been practicing this for years. Now they were on the final attack, and then the angel would be finished. Shinji and Asuka yelled as they both delivered a kick at the same time. They both pushed the angel back several miles as they kept the kick going. Eventually, it stopped as a huge cloud of smoke covered the Evas.  
战斗中，真嗣和明日香配合得天衣无缝。如果美里不了解情况，她会以为他们已经练习了多年。现在他们正在进行最后的攻击，然后使徒就会被消灭。真嗣和明日香同时大喊着踢出一脚。他们一起将使徒击退了好几英里，持续着这一踢击。最终，随着巨大的烟雾笼罩了 EVA，使徒停了下来。

"We're not detecting the Angel anymore!" Aoba shouted.  
"我们检测不到使徒的信号了！" 青叶喊道。

"Visual should be back in a few minutes!" Maya added. Everyone waited to see what happened. When the smoke cleared, they breathed a sigh of relief.  
"视觉应该几分钟后就恢复！" 玛雅补充道。大家都等待着看会发生什么。当烟雾散去，他们松了一口气。

Both the Evas were now standing where the Angel stopped. Everyone was now cheering as they saw the plan worked perfectly.  
两台 EVA 现在站在天使停下的地方。看到计划完美执行，所有人都欢呼起来。

"Congrats, you two!" Misato smiled as she spoke into a mic. "I knew the both of you could do it if you put your mind to it!"  
"恭喜你们俩！" 美里笑着对着麦克风说，"我知道只要你们用心，一定能做到！"

"Well, of course, I could do it." Asuka grinned. "Are you forgetting who you're talking to?"  
"当然，我可以做到。" 明日香咧嘴一笑。"你忘了你在跟谁说话吗？"

"Asuka, that's not fair." Misato shot back. "You and Shinji both did this together, and you need to..."  
"明日香，这不公平。" 美里反驳道。"你和真嗣一起做的这件事，你们需要……"

"Actually, Asuka does deserve most of the credit." Shinji interrupted them.  
"实际上，明日香确实应该得到大部分的功劳。" 真嗣打断了她们。

"See? Even Third agrees that..." Asuka's eyes shot open. "Wait, what did you say?"  
"看吧？就连三号也同意..." 明日香眼睛猛地睁大。"等等，你刚才说什么？"

"You helped me get focused during our training together, and I'm not sure I could have done this with anyone else."  
"你在我俩一起训练时帮我集中注意力，我不确定换了别人我能不能做到。"

"Oh." Asuka was frozen for a few moments. She quickly regained her composure and smiled. "As long as I'm here, we'll be able to defeat any Angel that comes our way! So remember that!"  
"哦。" 明日香愣了几秒。她迅速恢复镇定，微笑道："只要有我在，我们就能打败任何来袭的使徒！记住这一点！"

"I will." "我会的。"

"_What is with him today?_" Misato thought as she looked at the Evas. "_This isn't the Shinji I'm used to seeing._"  
"他今天怎么了？" 美里看着 EVA 们心想，"这不是我熟悉的真嗣。"

After bringing the Evas back to Central Dogma, Shinji and Asuka went to change. When they saw Ritsuko, she told them how impressed she was and that they could take the rest of the day off. After, changing they waited for Misato to come to get them.  
将 EVA 带回中央教条区后，真嗣和明日香去换了衣服。见到律子时，她告诉他们她有多么印象深刻，并让他们可以休息一整天。换好衣服后，他们等着美里来接他们。

"There you are, Third." Asuka saw Shinji walking towards her. "I was wondering what took you so long."  
"你在这儿啊，三号。" 明日香看到真嗣向她走来。"我还在想你怎么这么慢。"

"Sorry, I didn't realize I was taking so long." He smiled and scratched the back of his head.  
"抱歉，我没意识到我花了这么长时间。" 他笑了笑，挠了挠后脑勺。"

"Again, with all the apologies." Asuka rolled her eyes. "I meant to tell you how annoying that's getting. It's like it's a reaction whenever I say something."  
"又是道歉。" 明日香翻了个白眼。"我是想说你这样很烦人。每次我说什么你都这样反应。"

"Oh, s..." Shinji stopped himself as Asuka raised an eyebrow. "I mean, I'll try to stop that."  
"哦，呃..." 真嗣话到一半停了下来，因为明日香挑起了眉毛。"我是说，我会尽量克制。"

"Okay, I've had enough of this." Asuka sighed as she stared at him. "What's the deal with you today? Ever since this morning, you've been different. What happened to the Shinji that thought I was annoying?"  
"好了，我受够了。" 明日香叹了口气，盯着他。"你今天怎么了？从早上开始你就变了。那个觉得我烦人的真嗣去哪儿了？"

"Well, I..." Shinji tried to think of a response as he starred back at Asuka.  
"嗯，我..." 真嗣试图想出一个回答，同时回望着明日香。

"There you two are." A voice came from down a hall. As they both turned, they saw it was their guardian Misato. "Are you both ready to go?"  
"你们俩在这儿啊。" 一个声音从走廊传来。两人转身一看，原来是他们的监护人美里。"你们都准备好了吗？"

"Well, actually," Shinji tried to say as he walked towards Misato.  
"嗯，其实，" 真嗣试图开口，同时走向美里。

"Don't even try it!" Asuka jumped in front of him. "You're not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on with you!"  
"别想蒙混过关！" 明日香跳到他面前。"你不把事情说清楚，哪儿也别想去！"

"Asuka, what are you talking about?" Misato held out her hand as she got closer. "Maybe he just wanted to praise the good work you did."  
"明日香，你在说什么呢？" 美里一边靠近一边伸出手。"也许他只是想表扬你做得好。"

"It's not just that!" Asuka turned to face her. "Shinji's been acting weird since I woke up! He made me waffles after hearing from Kaji that it was my favorite! Then he says it was to show how happy he was fighting with me!"  
"不仅仅是那样！" 明日香转向她。"我从醒来后，真嗣的行为就很奇怪！他听卡兹说我喜欢吃华夫饼，就做了给我！然后他说这是为了表达和我并肩作战的喜悦！"

"That's..." Misato stood there, unsure what to say. She knew Shinji's reactions seemed off, but hearing all of that made her more shocked. She got closer to them and looked at Shinji. "Is everything okay, Shinji? You know if something is going on, you can tell me."  
"那真是..." 美里站在那里，不知该说什么。她知道真嗣的反应有些不对劲，但听到这一切让她更加震惊。她走近他们，看着真嗣。"真嗣，一切都好吗？你知道如果有事，可以告诉我。"

"It's just..." Shinji started to say as he looked at both of them. He figured he wasn't getting out of this but still wasn't sure how to tell either of them why he was acting so different. He was close to spitting it out until.  
"只是..." 真嗣开口说道，目光在两人之间游移。他明白自己躲不过这一关，但仍不确定该如何向他们解释自己为何表现得如此不同。他几乎要脱口而出，直到...

"Shinji-kun, there you are."  
"真嗣君，你在这里啊。"

All three of them turned and saw Kaji walking towards them.  
他们三人都转过身，看到加持正朝他们走来。

"Hope I'm not interrupting, but I need Shinji to come with me for a moment." Kaji walked up and placed his hand on Shinji's shoulder.  
"希望我没有打扰，但我需要真嗣跟我走一趟。" 加持走上前，把手放在真嗣的肩膀上。

"What do you need Shinji for?" Misato raised an eyebrow.  
"你需要真嗣做什么？" 美里挑了挑眉。

"It's something to do with the commander. That's all I know." Kaji smiled.  
"与司令有关的事情。我就知道这么多。" 加持微笑道。

"My father?" Shinji turned to look at him as Kaji started dragging him down a hall. "Hey, wait!"  
"我的父亲？" 真嗣转头看向他，而加持开始拉着他走过一条走廊。"嘿，等等！"

"Later, Katsuragi!" Kaji waved as he walked away with Shinji. "I'll bring Shinji back to your apartment myself!"  
"待会儿见，葛城！" 加持挥手告别，带着真嗣离开。"我会亲自把真嗣送回你的公寓！"

"Ehh! Why can't I get an answer!?" Asuka stomped her foot. "Right when we had him cornered, my sweet Kaji-san dragged him away!"  
"哎！为什么我得不到答案！？" 明日香跺了跺脚。"就在我们把他逼到绝境的时候，我的甜心加持先生把他带走了！"

"Let's just head home and wait to get an answer." Misato sighed as she started walking.  
"我们还是回家等着答复吧。" 美里叹了口气，开始向前走。

"You think he's acting weird too, right Misato?" Asuka walked beside her.  
"你也觉得他行为怪异，对吧，美里？" 明日香走在她旁边。

"About that, can you tell me more about what he did this morning?"  
关于那件事，你能告诉我他今天早上做了些什么吗？

As Misato and Asuka were talking, Kaji had stopped after dragging Shinji away from them.  
当美里和明日香交谈时，加持已经拖着真嗣离开了她们。

"Okay, I think we're safe now." Kaji let go of Shinji and leaned against a wall.  
“好了，我想我们现在安全了。” 加持松开真嗣，靠在墙上。

"What are you talking about?" Shinji looked at him. "I thought you said my father wanted me for something."  
“你在说什么呢？” 真嗣看着他。“我以为你说我父亲有事找我。”

"Sorry, I had to lie to make sure Katsuragi wouldn't follow us." Kaji smiled as he lit a cigarette.  
“抱歉，我不得不撒谎，以确保桂同学不会跟着我们。”加持点燃了一支烟，微笑着说道。

"Wait, so you wanted to talk to me alone? Why?"  
“等等，你是想单独和我谈谈吗？为什么？”

"Like them, I noticed you were acting weird." Kaji was now starring at Shinji and no longer smiling.  
"像他们一样，我也注意到你行为怪异。" 加持现在盯着真嗣，不再微笑。

"Oh, that." Shinji scratched the back of his head as he looked up. "I just thought maybe if I was nicer to Asuka, she'd be nicer."  
"哦，那个啊。" 真嗣挠了挠后脑勺，抬头说道。"我只是想，如果我对明日香好一点，她也许会对我好一些。"

"Shinji, don't try lying to me." Kaji walked up and looked into his face. "My job requires knowing a lot of things, one of which is when someone is lying. No offense, but you're horrible at it."  
“真嗣，别想对我撒谎。”加持走上前，直视着他的脸。“我的工作要求我了解很多事情，其中之一就是识破谎言。无意冒犯，但你在这方面糟糕透顶。”

Shinji just looked down and frowned. He hadn't known Kaji that long, but he started to look up to Kaji like a father. He sighed as he looked back up at him.  
真嗣只是低下头，皱起了眉。他和加持相处的时间并不长，但他开始像对待父亲一样仰望加持。他叹了口气，再次抬头看向他。

"If I tell you, you promise you won't tell Asuka or Misato?"  
“如果我告诉你，你保证不会告诉明日香或美里吗？”

"Let me put it this way. If it's not a serious issue we should worry about, it will be between us." Kaji smiled and backed off. "Fair enough?"  
“这么说吧，如果不是什么需要我们操心的严重问题，那就只在我们之间解决。”加持笑了笑，退后一步。“这样公平吧？”

"I guess." Shinji sighed as he took a seat on a nearby bench. "I'm acting weird because of something that happened last night."  
“我想是吧。” 真嗣叹了口气，在附近的长椅上坐下。“我行为怪异是因为昨晚发生了一些事。”
