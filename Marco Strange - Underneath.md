### Chapter 1
Shinji was currently trying to get some sleep. Tomorrow, he and Asuka would get another chance at defeating the Angel. All they had to do was work together for once, but that was easier said than done. He had his eyes close as he laid on his side.  
真嗣目前正试图睡一觉。明天，他和明日香将再次有机会击败天使。他们所要做的就是一起工作一次，但这说起来容易做起来难。他侧躺着，闭上了眼睛。

"Once this angel is defeated, we can stop being stuck together." Shinji sighed. "What even are the Walls of Jericho that she talked about?"  
“一旦这个天使被打败，我们就可以不再被困在一起了。”真嗣叹了口气。“她所说的耶利哥城墙到底是什么？”

Even after trying for so long, Shinji was unable to fall asleep. He didn't know if he was nervous or if it was one of the many nights he had trouble sleeping, but it annoyed him either way. His focus changed, though, when he heard someone lay down next to him.  
即使尝试了这么久，真嗣也无法入睡。他不知道自己是紧张还是这是他难以入睡的许多夜晚之一，但无论如何，这让他很恼火。然而，当他听到有人躺在他旁边时，他的注意力发生了变化。

"What the..." He slowly opened his eyes and jumped backward. In front of him was a sleeping Asuka. He sweated as he kept staring at her. "_What in the world is she doing next to me!? I thought she didn't want to be asleep next to me tonight!_"  
“什么......”他缓缓睁开眼睛，向后跳去。在他面前的是熟睡的明日香。他一直盯着她看，汗流浃背。“她在我旁边干什么！？我以为她今晚不想在我旁边睡着！

As he was looking at her, he couldn't help but look down at her loose t-shirt. He blushed as he realized Asuka would kill him if she knew he was doing that. He lifted his eyes back to her face, hearing her talking. Luckily, it looked like she was still asleep. He couldn't help but move closer as he thought about kissing her. He couldn't explain why, but he wanted to kiss her while she was in front of him. He slowly leaned in forward as he kept thinking about...  
当他看着她时，他忍不住低头看了看她宽松的T恤。他脸红了，因为他意识到如果明日香知道他这样做，她会杀了他。他抬起眼睛看向她的脸，听见她说话。幸运的是，她看起来还在睡着。当他想亲吻她时，他忍不住靠近了。他无法解释为什么，但他想在她面前亲吻她。他慢慢地向前倾身，不停地想着......

"M..." Asuka mumbled, making Shinji stop in his tracks. "Mo...Momma..."  
“嗯......”明日香嘟囔着，让真嗣停下了脚步。“莫......妈妈......”

"Momma?" Shinji raised an eyebrow as he kept looking at her. He jumped as he saw her starting to cry. Before he could react, Asuka rolled to her side.  
“妈妈？”真嗣挑了挑眉毛，一直看着她。当他看到她开始哭泣时，他跳了起来。还没等他反应过来，明日香就滚到了她的身边。

"Momma..." Asuka wept as she faced the other direction. "Why did you leave me, Momma? I need you. I don't have anyone else, momma."  
“妈妈......”明日香面对着另一个方向哭泣。“妈妈，你为什么离开我？我需要你。我没有其他人了，妈妈。

Shinji gulped as he watched Asuka in her current state. He knew her as overconfident and not afraid of anything. Now he was watching her cry for her mother like a toddler. He couldn't explain why, but he put his arm over her and curled up to her.  
真嗣看着明日香现在的状态咽了口唾沫。他知道她过于自信，什么都不怕。现在他看着她像个蹒跚学步的孩子一样为她的母亲哭泣。他无法解释为什么，但他把胳膊搂在她身上，蜷缩在她身边。

"It's okay." He whispered as he leaned into her ear. "You're not alone."  
“没关系。”他凑到她耳边低声说。“你并不孤单。”

Asuka started to calm down after Shinji put his arm around her. Shinji could still hear her silently weeping, but he sighed as he saw her sleeping like normal. Without realizing he, Shinji was finally drifting off to sleep.  
明日香在真嗣搂着她后开始冷静下来。真嗣仍然能听到她默默地哭泣，但当他看到她像往常一样睡觉时，他叹了口气。不知不觉中，真嗣终于睡着了。

The next day, Shinji rubbed his eyes as he started to wake up.  
第二天，真嗣揉了揉眼睛，开始醒来。

"Man, that was some dream." Shinji slowly opened his eyes and jumped back. He saw Asuka still in front of him. Just like the night before. "So that wasn't a dream then."  
“伙计，那是个梦。”真嗣缓缓睁开眼睛，向后跳了回去。他看到明日香还在他面前。就像前一天晚上一样。“所以那不是梦。”

As Shinji looked down at Asuka. A million things were going through his head. He didn't know how to explain to Asuka why she was there, let alone why he was curled up to her like that. Thankfully she was still asleep, but she'd probably be wondering how she went from one room to another. He then looked at the clock and realized it was earlier than they were supposed to get up.  
真嗣低头看着明日香。他脑子里闪过一百万件事情。他不知道如何向明日香解释她为什么在那里，更不用说为什么他这样蜷缩在她面前了。谢天谢地，她还在睡着，但她可能想知道她是如何从一个房间走到另一个房间的。然后他看了看时钟，发现它比他们应该起床的时间要早。

"What in the world am I supposed to do?" He sighed as he knew it would be over an hour before they'd be picked up. He looked back over at Asuka and saw she was still asleep. Right now, his stomach was growling, and figured that he wouldn't be able to go back to sleep. He went to the kitchen and started making himself something to eat. Since he just wanted anything, he had a bowl of cereal. As he ate, he couldn't get what he saw last night out of his head. "Was that the real Asuka I saw last night?"  
“我到底该怎么办？”他叹了口气，因为他知道他们要过一个多小时才能被接走。他回头看了看明日香，发现她还在睡着。此刻，他的肚子在咕咕叫，他觉得自己再也睡不着了。他去了厨房，开始给自己做点吃的。因为他什么都想要，所以他有一碗麦片。当他吃饭时，他无法将昨晚看到的东西从脑海中抹去。“那是我昨晚看到的真正的明日香吗？”

Shinji was still thinking about what he should do about what he saw. If he tried talking to Asuka, chances are she'd kill him or just deny it. If he tried telling Misato, Asuka would do the same thing. Part of him started to feel bad thinking that Asuka is like him and feels alone. He finished his cereal and looked back at the clock.  
真嗣还在想他应该对他所看到的做些什么。如果他试图与明日香交谈，她很可能会杀了他或否认。如果他试图告诉美里，明日香也会做同样的事情。他的一部分开始感到难过，认为明日香和他一样，感到孤独。他吃完麦片，回头看了看时钟。

"Well, I have a lot of time to kill anyway." He stood up and walked to a cupboard.  
“嗯，反正我有很多时间可以杀人。”他站起身来，走到一个柜子前。

After some time, Asuka was awoken by the smell of something good. She sat up and rubbed her eyes. She jumped up as she saw where she was.  
过了一会儿，明日香被好东西的气味吵醒了。她坐了起来，揉了揉眼睛。当她看到自己在哪里时，她跳了起来。

"Why the hell am I in here!?" Asuka stomped as she went looking for Shinji. "You baka! You better have a good explanation for..."  
“我到底为什么在这里！？”明日香跺了跺脚，去找真嗣。“你巴卡！你最好有一个很好的解释......”

"Good morning, Asuka." Shinji smiled as he sat a plate down at the table. I woke up early and thought I'd make you breakfast."  
“早上好，明日香。”真嗣笑着在桌边坐下。我起得很早，以为我会给你做早餐。

"You..." Asuka froze as she looked at him and the plate. "You made me that for breakfast?"  
“你......”明日香看着他和盘子，愣住了。“早餐是你给我做的？”

"I heard from Kaji awhile ago that you loved waffles. It's my first attempt at trying them, but I thought you'd love some for our fight today."  
“我前段时间从Kaji那里听说你喜欢华夫饼。这是我第一次尝试它们，但我认为你会喜欢我们今天的战斗。

Asuka approached closer and saw what he made for her. There were two homemade waffles, topped with strawberry syrup and fresh-cut strawberries.  
明日香走近了，看到了他为她所做的一切。有两个自制的华夫饼，上面放着草莓糖浆和鲜切草莓。

"You did all this for me?" Asuka stared at the plate. "Even though you're supposed to be focused on the battle?"  
“这一切是你为我做的？”明日香盯着盘子。“就算你应该专注于战斗？”

"Well, I wanted you to be 100 percent and wanted to show I'm happy that we're fighting together."  
“好吧，我希望你是100%的，并想表明我很高兴我们一起战斗。

"How did you even have a waffle maker to make these?"  
“你是怎么有华夫饼机来做这些的？”

"Misato had it laying around." Shinji giggled. "I just thought it was time to break it out."  
“美里把它放在身边。”真嗣咯咯地笑了起来。“我只是觉得是时候打破它了。”

Asuka stood there, unsure what to say. She could indeed get whatever she wanted, but no one ever treated her the same way Shinji was. They've spent the last few days usually fighting, and now he's making breakfast and telling her he wants her by his side.  
明日香站在那里，不知道该说什么。她确实可以得到她想要的任何东西，但从来没有人像真嗣那样对待她。在过去的几天里，他们经常吵架，现在他正在做早餐，告诉她他想让她陪在他身边。

"Well, that's great that you did that!" Asuka grinned as she crossed her arms. "Of course, an ace pilot like myself wouldn't need this, but I appreciate the thought that went into it!"  
“嗯，你这样做真是太好了！”明日香咧嘴一笑，双臂交叉。“当然，像我这样的王牌飞行员不需要这个，但我很欣赏你的想法！”

"I'm happy to hear that." Shinji continued to smile, making Asuka shocked. He expected him to roll his eyes at her like usual.  
“我很高兴听到这个消息。”真嗣继续微笑，让明日香震惊不已。他以为他会像往常一样对她翻白眼。

"Well, I still need to brush my teeth either way." Asuka turned away and walked to the bathroom. "Don't you dare think about eating my waffles either, baka!"  
“嗯，不管怎样，我还是需要刷牙的。”明日香转身走向洗手间。“你也不敢想吃我的华夫饼吗，巴卡！”

"I won't." Asuka took one last look and saw he was still smiling. She just kept walking to the bathroom and quickly closed the door. She then started brushing her teeth.  
“我不会。”明日香最后看了一眼，发现他仍然在微笑。她只是不停地走到洗手间，然后迅速关上了门。然后她开始刷牙。

"_What in the world is going on with him?_" Asuka looked at herself in the mirror. "_Why did he put all this effort into making me happy? I thought he hated me and was annoyed with our situation._"  
“他到底是怎么回事？”明日香看着镜子里的自己。“他为什么要付出这么多努力来让我开心？我以为他讨厌我，对我们的处境感到恼火。

Once Asuka brushed her teeth, she rinsed out her mouth and took one last look in the mirror.  
明日香刷完牙后，漱口，最后照了照镜子。

"Whatever it is, I'm not going to pass up a tasty breakfast." She smiled as she turned and walked back to the kitchen. "_Hopefully, that baka listened and didn't eat any of my waffles._"  
“不管是什么，我都不会错过一顿美味的早餐。”她微笑着转身走回厨房。“希望那个巴卡听了，没有吃我的任何华夫饼。”

As Asuka walked back in, she saw the waffles were still there, and Shinji was now in the living room. Asuka decided to ask him about it later and eat her breakfast. She sat down and began cutting off a piece of a waffle. She put it in her mouth and almost screamed in joy from how good it tasted. She continued to eat it until it was completely gone.  
当明日香走回去时，她看到华夫饼还在那里，真嗣现在在客厅里。明日香决定稍后再问他这件事，然后吃她的早餐。她坐下来，开始切一块华夫饼。她把它放进嘴里，几乎高兴地尖叫起来，因为它的味道有多好。她继续吃它，直到它完全消失。
