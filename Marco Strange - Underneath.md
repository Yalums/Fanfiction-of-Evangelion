### Chapter 1
Shinji was currently trying to get some sleep. Tomorrow, he and Asuka would get another chance at defeating the Angel. All they had to do was work together for once, but that was easier said than done. He had his eyes close as he laid on his side.  
真嗣此刻正试图入睡。明天，他和明日香将再次有机会击败使徒。他们只需要这一次合作，但说起来容易做起来难。他闭上眼睛，侧身躺着。

"Once this angel is defeated, we can stop being stuck together." Shinji sighed. "What even are the Walls of Jericho that she talked about?"  
"一旦打败这个天使，我们就能不再被束缚在一起了。" 真嗣叹了口气。"她说的耶利哥之墙到底是什么？"

Even after trying for so long, Shinji was unable to fall asleep. He didn't know if he was nervous or if it was one of the many nights he had trouble sleeping, but it annoyed him either way. His focus changed, though, when he heard someone lay down next to him.  
即使尝试了这么久，真嗣还是无法入睡。他不知道自己是紧张还是这只是又一个难以入眠的夜晚，但无论如何都让他感到烦躁。然而，当听到有人躺在他旁边时，他的注意力转移了。

"What the..." He slowly opened his eyes and jumped backward. In front of him was a sleeping Asuka. He sweated as he kept staring at her. "_What in the world is she doing next to me!? I thought she didn't want to be asleep next to me tonight!_"  
"什么鬼..." 他缓缓睁开眼睛，向后一跳。眼前是熟睡的明日香。他一边盯着她，一边冒汗。"她到底在我旁边做什么！？我以为她今晚不想和我一起睡！"

As he was looking at her, he couldn't help but look down at her loose t-shirt. He blushed as he realized Asuka would kill him if she knew he was doing that. He lifted his eyes back to her face, hearing her talking. Luckily, it looked like she was still asleep. He couldn't help but move closer as he thought about kissing her. He couldn't explain why, but he wanted to kiss her while she was in front of him. He slowly leaned in forward as he kept thinking about...  
当他看着她时，目光不由自主地落在了她宽松的 T 恤上。意识到如果明日香知道他在这么做，肯定会杀了他，他的脸颊泛起了红晕。他抬起眼睛回到她的脸上，听着她说话。幸运的是，看起来她还在熟睡。他忍不住向她靠近，心中想着要吻她。他无法解释为什么，但当她就在眼前时，他渴望吻她。他一边想着，一边慢慢地向前倾身...

"M..." Asuka mumbled, making Shinji stop in his tracks. "Mo...Momma..."  
“妈...”明日香喃喃自语，让真嗣停下了动作。“妈...妈妈...”

"Momma?" Shinji raised an eyebrow as he kept looking at her. He jumped as he saw her starting to cry. Before he could react, Asuka rolled to her side.  
“妈妈？”真嗣挑起眉毛，继续看着她。看到她开始哭泣，他吓了一跳。还没等他反应过来，明日香已经翻身侧躺了。

"Momma..." Asuka wept as she faced the other direction. "Why did you leave me, Momma? I need you. I don't have anyone else, momma."  
"妈妈..." 明日香转向另一边哭泣着。"为什么你要离开我，妈妈？我需要你。我没有其他人了，妈妈。"

Shinji gulped as he watched Asuka in her current state. He knew her as overconfident and not afraid of anything. Now he was watching her cry for her mother like a toddler. He couldn't explain why, but he put his arm over her and curled up to her.  
真嗣咽了口唾沫，看着此刻的明日香。他认识的她总是自信满满，无所畏惧。现在他却看到她像个幼儿一样为母亲哭泣。他说不出为什么，但还是伸出手臂搂住她，蜷缩在她身边。

"It's okay." He whispered as he leaned into her ear. "You're not alone."  
"没事的。" 他贴近她的耳朵轻声说。"你并不孤单。"

Asuka started to calm down after Shinji put his arm around her. Shinji could still hear her silently weeping, but he sighed as he saw her sleeping like normal. Without realizing he, Shinji was finally drifting off to sleep.  
在真嗣搂住她之后，明日香开始平静下来。真嗣仍能听到她在默默哭泣，但看到她像往常一样睡着了，他叹了口气。不知不觉中，真嗣也终于渐渐进入了梦乡。

The next day, Shinji rubbed his eyes as he started to wake up.  
第二天，真嗣揉着眼睛开始醒来。

"Man, that was some dream." Shinji slowly opened his eyes and jumped back. He saw Asuka still in front of him. Just like the night before. "So that wasn't a dream then."  
“天啊，那真是个梦。”真嗣缓缓睁开眼睛，猛地向后一跳。他看到明日香仍在他面前。就像昨晚一样。“这么说那不是梦。”

As Shinji looked down at Asuka. A million things were going through his head. He didn't know how to explain to Asuka why she was there, let alone why he was curled up to her like that. Thankfully she was still asleep, but she'd probably be wondering how she went from one room to another. He then looked at the clock and realized it was earlier than they were supposed to get up.  
当真嗣低头看着明日香时，他的脑海中闪过无数念头。他不知道该如何向明日香解释她为何在那里，更别说他为何会那样蜷缩在她身边。幸好她还在熟睡，但她大概会疑惑自己是怎么从一间房到了另一间的。他随后看了看时钟，意识到时间比他们应该起床的时间还要早。

"What in the world am I supposed to do?" He sighed as he knew it would be over an hour before they'd be picked up. He looked back over at Asuka and saw she was still asleep. Right now, his stomach was growling, and figured that he wouldn't be able to go back to sleep. He went to the kitchen and started making himself something to eat. Since he just wanted anything, he had a bowl of cereal. As he ate, he couldn't get what he saw last night out of his head. "Was that the real Asuka I saw last night?"  
“我到底该怎么办？”他叹了口气，知道还要过上一个多小时才会有人来接他们。他回头看向明日香，见她仍在熟睡。此刻，他的肚子咕咕叫，心想自己大概是睡不着了。他走进厨房，开始给自己弄点吃的。既然只想随便吃点什么，他便盛了一碗麦片。吃着吃着，昨晚看到的情景始终挥之不去。“昨晚我看到的是真正的明日香吗？”

Shinji was still thinking about what he should do about what he saw. If he tried talking to Asuka, chances are she'd kill him or just deny it. If he tried telling Misato, Asuka would do the same thing. Part of him started to feel bad thinking that Asuka is like him and feels alone. He finished his cereal and looked back at the clock.  
真嗣还在思考该如何处理他所看到的事情。如果他试图和明日香谈谈，她很可能会杀了他或者干脆否认。如果他告诉美里，明日香也会做出同样的事情。他的一部分开始感到难过，认为明日香和他一样，感到孤独。他吃完麦片，回头看了看时钟。

"Well, I have a lot of time to kill anyway." He stood up and walked to a cupboard.  
“好吧，反正我有很多时间可以消磨。”他站起来，走向一个橱柜。

After some time, Asuka was awoken by the smell of something good. She sat up and rubbed her eyes. She jumped up as she saw where she was.  
过了一会儿，明日香被某种好闻的味道唤醒。她坐起来揉了揉眼睛。当她看到自己在哪里时，她跳了起来。

"Why the hell am I in here!?" Asuka stomped as she went looking for Shinji. "You baka! You better have a good explanation for..."  
"我到底为什么会在这里！？" 明日香一边跺脚一边寻找真嗣。"你这个笨蛋！最好有个像样的解释……"

"Good morning, Asuka." Shinji smiled as he sat a plate down at the table. I woke up early and thought I'd make you breakfast."  
"早上好，明日香。" 真嗣微笑着将一盘食物放在桌上。"我早起了一会儿，想着给你做早餐。"

"You..." Asuka froze as she looked at him and the plate. "You made me that for breakfast?"  
"你……" 明日香看着他和那盘食物，愣住了。"你为我做了这个当早餐？"

"I heard from Kaji awhile ago that you loved waffles. It's my first attempt at trying them, but I thought you'd love some for our fight today."  
"我之前听阿基说你喜欢吃华夫饼。这是我第一次尝试做，但我想你今天会喜欢在战斗中吃点。"

Asuka approached closer and saw what he made for her. There were two homemade waffles, topped with strawberry syrup and fresh-cut strawberries.  
明日香走近一看，发现他为她做了什么。那是两块自制的华夫饼，上面淋着草莓糖浆，还点缀着新鲜切片的草莓。

"You did all this for me?" Asuka stared at the plate. "Even though you're supposed to be focused on the battle?"  
"你为我做了这一切？" 明日香盯着盘子。"即使你应该专注于战斗？"

"Well, I wanted you to be 100 percent and wanted to show I'm happy that we're fighting together."  
"嗯，我希望你能全力以赴，也想表达我很高兴我们能并肩作战。"

"How did you even have a waffle maker to make these?"  
"你哪来的华夫饼机做这些？"

"Misato had it laying around." Shinji giggled. "I just thought it was time to break it out."  
"美里把它放在一边了。" 真嗣咯咯笑道。"我只是觉得是时候拿出来用了。"

Asuka stood there, unsure what to say. She could indeed get whatever she wanted, but no one ever treated her the same way Shinji was. They've spent the last few days usually fighting, and now he's making breakfast and telling her he wants her by his side.  
明日香站在那里，不知该说什么。她的确可以得到任何想要的东西，但没有人像真嗣这样对待她。过去几天他们通常在争吵，而现在他却在做早餐，告诉她希望她在他身边。

"Well, that's great that you did that!" Asuka grinned as she crossed her arms. "Of course, an ace pilot like myself wouldn't need this, but I appreciate the thought that went into it!"  
"嗯，你这么做真是太好了！" 明日香咧嘴一笑，双臂交叉。"当然，像我这样的王牌飞行员不需要这个，但我很感激你的用心！"

"I'm happy to hear that." Shinji continued to smile, making Asuka shocked. He expected him to roll his eyes at her like usual.  
"听到这个我很高兴。" 真嗣继续微笑，这让明日香感到震惊。他本以为他会像往常一样对她翻白眼。

"Well, I still need to brush my teeth either way." Asuka turned away and walked to the bathroom. "Don't you dare think about eating my waffles either, baka!"  
"反正我还是得刷牙。" 明日香转身走向浴室。"你敢打我华夫饼的主意试试，笨蛋！"

"I won't." Asuka took one last look and saw he was still smiling. She just kept walking to the bathroom and quickly closed the door. She then started brushing her teeth.  
"我不会的。" 明日香最后看了一眼，发现他还在微笑。她继续走向浴室，迅速关上门，然后开始刷牙。

"_What in the world is going on with him?_" Asuka looked at herself in the mirror. "_Why did he put all this effort into making me happy? I thought he hated me and was annoyed with our situation._"  
“他到底是怎么回事？”明日香对着镜子中的自己问道，“为什么他费尽心思让我开心？我以为他讨厌我，对我们这种情况感到厌烦。”

Once Asuka brushed her teeth, she rinsed out her mouth and took one last look in the mirror.  
当明日香刷完牙后，她漱了漱口，最后一次对着镜子看了看自己。

"Whatever it is, I'm not going to pass up a tasty breakfast." She smiled as she turned and walked back to the kitchen. "_Hopefully, that baka listened and didn't eat any of my waffles._"  
“不管是什么，我都不会错过美味的早餐。”她笑着转身走回厨房。“希望那个笨蛋听话，没有吃掉我的华夫饼。”

As Asuka walked back in, she saw the waffles were still there, and Shinji was now in the living room. Asuka decided to ask him about it later and eat her breakfast. She sat down and began cutting off a piece of a waffle. She put it in her mouth and almost screamed in joy from how good it tasted. She continued to eat it until it was completely gone.  
当明日香走回来时，她看到华夫饼还在那里，而真嗣现在在客厅。明日香决定稍后再问他，先享用早餐。她坐下来，开始切下一块华夫饼。她把它放进嘴里，差点因为它的美味而欢呼出声。她继续吃，直到完全吃完。

### Chapter 2
"_Come on, kids._" Misato watched on and smiled. "_I don't know why, but those two are working together perfectly._"  
"快点，孩子们。" 美里看着他们，微笑着。"我不知道为什么，但那两个人配合得天衣无缝。"

During the fight, Shinji and Asuka were perfectly in synch. If Misato didn't know better, she would believe they'd been practicing this for years. Now they were on the final attack, and then the angel would be finished. Shinji and Asuka yelled as they both delivered a kick at the same time. They both pushed the angel back several miles as they kept the kick going. Eventually, it stopped as a huge cloud of smoke covered the Evas.  
战斗中，真嗣和明日香配合得天衣无缝。如果美里不了解情况，她会以为他们已经练习了多年。现在他们正在进行最后的攻击，然后使徒就会被消灭。真嗣和明日香同时大喊着踢出一脚。他们一起将使徒击退了好几英里，持续着这一踢击。最终，随着巨大的烟雾笼罩了 EVA，使徒停了下来。

"We're not detecting the Angel anymore!" Aoba shouted.  
"我们检测不到使徒的信号了！" 青叶喊道。

"Visual should be back in a few minutes!" Maya added. Everyone waited to see what happened. When the smoke cleared, they breathed a sigh of relief.  
"视觉应该几分钟后就恢复！" 玛雅补充道。大家都等待着看会发生什么。当烟雾散去，他们松了一口气。

Both the Evas were now standing where the Angel stopped. Everyone was now cheering as they saw the plan worked perfectly.  
两台 EVA 现在站在天使停下的地方。看到计划完美执行，所有人都欢呼起来。

"Congrats, you two!" Misato smiled as she spoke into a mic. "I knew the both of you could do it if you put your mind to it!"  
"恭喜你们俩！" 美里笑着对着麦克风说，"我知道只要你们用心，一定能做到！"

"Well, of course, I could do it." Asuka grinned. "Are you forgetting who you're talking to?"  
"当然，我可以做到。" 明日香咧嘴一笑。"你忘了你在跟谁说话吗？"

"Asuka, that's not fair." Misato shot back. "You and Shinji both did this together, and you need to..."  
"明日香，这不公平。" 美里反驳道。"你和真嗣一起做的这件事，你们需要……"

"Actually, Asuka does deserve most of the credit." Shinji interrupted them.  
"实际上，明日香确实应该得到大部分的功劳。" 真嗣打断了她们。

"See? Even Third agrees that..." Asuka's eyes shot open. "Wait, what did you say?"  
"看吧？就连三号也同意..." 明日香眼睛猛地睁大。"等等，你刚才说什么？"

"You helped me get focused during our training together, and I'm not sure I could have done this with anyone else."  
"你在我俩一起训练时帮我集中注意力，我不确定换了别人我能不能做到。"

"Oh." Asuka was frozen for a few moments. She quickly regained her composure and smiled. "As long as I'm here, we'll be able to defeat any Angel that comes our way! So remember that!"  
"哦。" 明日香愣了几秒。她迅速恢复镇定，微笑道："只要有我在，我们就能打败任何来袭的使徒！记住这一点！"

"I will." "我会的。"

"_What is with him today?_" Misato thought as she looked at the Evas. "_This isn't the Shinji I'm used to seeing._"  
"他今天怎么了？" 美里看着 EVA 们心想，"这不是我熟悉的真嗣。"

After bringing the Evas back to Central Dogma, Shinji and Asuka went to change. When they saw Ritsuko, she told them how impressed she was and that they could take the rest of the day off. After, changing they waited for Misato to come to get them.  
将 EVA 带回中央教条区后，真嗣和明日香去换了衣服。见到律子时，她告诉他们她有多么印象深刻，并让他们可以休息一整天。换好衣服后，他们等着美里来接他们。

"There you are, Third." Asuka saw Shinji walking towards her. "I was wondering what took you so long."  
"你在这儿啊，三号。" 明日香看到真嗣向她走来。"我还在想你怎么这么慢。"

"Sorry, I didn't realize I was taking so long." He smiled and scratched the back of his head.  
"抱歉，我没意识到我花了这么长时间。" 他笑了笑，挠了挠后脑勺。"

"Again, with all the apologies." Asuka rolled her eyes. "I meant to tell you how annoying that's getting. It's like it's a reaction whenever I say something."  
"又是道歉。" 明日香翻了个白眼。"我是想说你这样很烦人。每次我说什么你都这样反应。"

"Oh, s..." Shinji stopped himself as Asuka raised an eyebrow. "I mean, I'll try to stop that."  
"哦，呃..." 真嗣话到一半停了下来，因为明日香挑起了眉毛。"我是说，我会尽量克制。"

"Okay, I've had enough of this." Asuka sighed as she stared at him. "What's the deal with you today? Ever since this morning, you've been different. What happened to the Shinji that thought I was annoying?"  
"好了，我受够了。" 明日香叹了口气，盯着他。"你今天怎么了？从早上开始你就变了。那个觉得我烦人的真嗣去哪儿了？"

"Well, I..." Shinji tried to think of a response as he starred back at Asuka.  
"嗯，我..." 真嗣试图想出一个回答，同时回望着明日香。

"There you two are." A voice came from down a hall. As they both turned, they saw it was their guardian Misato. "Are you both ready to go?"  
"你们俩在这儿啊。" 一个声音从走廊传来。两人转身一看，原来是他们的监护人美里。"你们都准备好了吗？"

"Well, actually," Shinji tried to say as he walked towards Misato.  
"嗯，其实，" 真嗣试图开口，同时走向美里。

"Don't even try it!" Asuka jumped in front of him. "You're not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on with you!"  
"别想蒙混过关！" 明日香跳到他面前。"你不把事情说清楚，哪儿也别想去！"

"Asuka, what are you talking about?" Misato held out her hand as she got closer. "Maybe he just wanted to praise the good work you did."  
"明日香，你在说什么呢？" 美里一边靠近一边伸出手。"也许他只是想表扬你做得好。"

"It's not just that!" Asuka turned to face her. "Shinji's been acting weird since I woke up! He made me waffles after hearing from Kaji that it was my favorite! Then he says it was to show how happy he was fighting with me!"  
"不仅仅是那样！" 明日香转向她。"我从醒来后，真嗣的行为就很奇怪！他听卡兹说我喜欢吃华夫饼，就做了给我！然后他说这是为了表达和我并肩作战的喜悦！"

"That's..." Misato stood there, unsure what to say. She knew Shinji's reactions seemed off, but hearing all of that made her more shocked. She got closer to them and looked at Shinji. "Is everything okay, Shinji? You know if something is going on, you can tell me."  
"那真是..." 美里站在那里，不知该说什么。她知道真嗣的反应有些不对劲，但听到这一切让她更加震惊。她走近他们，看着真嗣。"真嗣，一切都好吗？你知道如果有事，可以告诉我。"

"It's just..." Shinji started to say as he looked at both of them. He figured he wasn't getting out of this but still wasn't sure how to tell either of them why he was acting so different. He was close to spitting it out until.  
"只是..." 真嗣开口说道，目光在两人之间游移。他明白自己躲不过这一关，但仍不确定该如何向他们解释自己为何表现得如此不同。他几乎要脱口而出，直到...

"Shinji-kun, there you are."  
"真嗣君，你在这里啊。"

All three of them turned and saw Kaji walking towards them.  
他们三人都转过身，看到加持正朝他们走来。

"Hope I'm not interrupting, but I need Shinji to come with me for a moment." Kaji walked up and placed his hand on Shinji's shoulder.  
"希望我没有打扰，但我需要真嗣跟我走一趟。" 加持走上前，把手放在真嗣的肩膀上。

"What do you need Shinji for?" Misato raised an eyebrow.  
"你需要真嗣做什么？" 美里挑了挑眉。

"It's something to do with the commander. That's all I know." Kaji smiled.  
"与司令有关的事情。我就知道这么多。" 加持微笑道。

"My father?" Shinji turned to look at him as Kaji started dragging him down a hall. "Hey, wait!"  
"我的父亲？" 真嗣转头看向他，而加持开始拉着他走过一条走廊。"嘿，等等！"

"Later, Katsuragi!" Kaji waved as he walked away with Shinji. "I'll bring Shinji back to your apartment myself!"  
"待会儿见，葛城！" 加持挥手告别，带着真嗣离开。"我会亲自把真嗣送回你的公寓！"

"Ehh! Why can't I get an answer!?" Asuka stomped her foot. "Right when we had him cornered, my sweet Kaji-san dragged him away!"  
"哎！为什么我得不到答案！？" 明日香跺了跺脚。"就在我们把他逼到绝境的时候，我的甜心加持先生把他带走了！"

"Let's just head home and wait to get an answer." Misato sighed as she started walking.  
"我们还是回家等着答复吧。" 美里叹了口气，开始向前走。

"You think he's acting weird too, right Misato?" Asuka walked beside her.  
"你也觉得他行为怪异，对吧，美里？" 明日香走在她旁边。

"About that, can you tell me more about what he did this morning?"  
关于那件事，你能告诉我他今天早上做了些什么吗？

As Misato and Asuka were talking, Kaji had stopped after dragging Shinji away from them.  
当美里和明日香交谈时，加持已经拖着真嗣离开了她们。

"Okay, I think we're safe now." Kaji let go of Shinji and leaned against a wall.  
“好了，我想我们现在安全了。” 加持松开真嗣，靠在墙上。

"What are you talking about?" Shinji looked at him. "I thought you said my father wanted me for something."  
“你在说什么呢？” 真嗣看着他。“我以为你说我父亲有事找我。”

"Sorry, I had to lie to make sure Katsuragi wouldn't follow us." Kaji smiled as he lit a cigarette.  
“抱歉，我不得不撒谎，以确保桂同学不会跟着我们。”加持点燃了一支烟，微笑着说道。

"Wait, so you wanted to talk to me alone? Why?"  
“等等，你是想单独和我谈谈吗？为什么？”

"Like them, I noticed you were acting weird." Kaji was now starring at Shinji and no longer smiling.  
"像他们一样，我也注意到你行为怪异。" 加持现在盯着真嗣，不再微笑。

"Oh, that." Shinji scratched the back of his head as he looked up. "I just thought maybe if I was nicer to Asuka, she'd be nicer."  
"哦，那个啊。" 真嗣挠了挠后脑勺，抬头说道。"我只是想，如果我对明日香好一点，她也许会对我好一些。"

"Shinji, don't try lying to me." Kaji walked up and looked into his face. "My job requires knowing a lot of things, one of which is when someone is lying. No offense, but you're horrible at it."  
“真嗣，别想对我撒谎。”加持走上前，直视着他的脸。“我的工作要求我了解很多事情，其中之一就是识破谎言。无意冒犯，但你在这方面糟糕透顶。”

Shinji just looked down and frowned. He hadn't known Kaji that long, but he started to look up to Kaji like a father. He sighed as he looked back up at him.  
真嗣只是低下头，皱起了眉。他和加持相处的时间并不长，但他开始像对待父亲一样仰望加持。他叹了口气，再次抬头看向他。

"If I tell you, you promise you won't tell Asuka or Misato?"  
“如果我告诉你，你保证不会告诉明日香或美里吗？”

"Let me put it this way. If it's not a serious issue we should worry about, it will be between us." Kaji smiled and backed off. "Fair enough?"  
“这么说吧，如果不是什么需要我们操心的严重问题，那就只在我们之间解决。”加持笑了笑，退后一步。“这样公平吧？”

"I guess." Shinji sighed as he took a seat on a nearby bench. "I'm acting weird because of something that happened last night."  
“我想是吧。” 真嗣叹了口气，在附近的长椅上坐下。“我行为怪异是因为昨晚发生了一些事。”

### Chapter 3
"Last night?" Kaji raised an eyebrow. "What happened?"  
"昨晚？" 加持挑了挑眉。"发生了什么？"

"Well, it started when Asuka decided to sleep in another room from me and said it was like the Walls of Jericho." Shinji was looking down on the ground. "After that, I tried going to sleep."  
"嗯，事情起因是明日香决定不和我睡同一个房间，还说这就像耶利哥的城墙。" 真嗣低头看着地面。"之后，我就尝试入睡。"

"Of course." Kaji facepalmed as he started to mumble. "Why in the world did Asuka think he'd get that reference?"  
"当然。" 加持捂脸，开始喃喃自语。"明日香怎么会以为他能理解那个典故？"

"Did you say something?" Shinji now looked up at him.  
"你刚才说什么了吗？" 真嗣现在抬头看着他。

"It's nothing. Just continue." Kaji waved his hand.  
"没什么。继续吧。" 加持挥了挥手。

"Well, as I said, I tried to go to sleep and had trouble doing that. Then all of a sudden, Asuka was right in front of me."  
"嗯，就像我说的，我试着去睡觉，但很难入睡。然后突然间，明日香就出现在我面前。"

"Wait, she came back out after saying she wanted to be alone?" Kaji took a seat next to him.  
"等等，她说想一个人待着，结果又出来了？" 加持在他旁边坐下。

"No, she was still asleep." Shinji paused for a few moments and took a deep breath. "Then, while she was laying in front of me, she started calling for her mom."  
"不，她还在睡。" 真嗣停顿了一会儿，深吸了一口气。"然后，她躺在我面前，开始喊妈妈。"

"I see." Kaji kept looking at him. "Did anything else happen?"  
"原来如此。" 加持继续看着他。"还有其他事发生吗？"

"She..." Shinji looked back at the ground. "She started crying and saying she didn't want to be alone."  
"她..." 真嗣回头看向地面。"她开始哭泣，说她不想一个人。"

"And what did you do after this?" Shinji was now facing Kaji again, a little shocked at his question.  
"那你之后做了什么？" 真嗣再次面对加持，对他的问题感到有些惊讶。"

"I don't know why, but I put my arm around her and whispered that she wasn't alone."  
"我不知道为什么，但我搂住了她，轻声告诉她并不孤单。"

"I see." Kaji smiled as he put his arm around Shinji. "I know you don't realize it, but you did the right thing for Asuka that night. You're also doing the right thing telling me all of this."  
"我明白了。" 加持笑着将手臂搭在真嗣肩上。"我知道你没意识到，但那晚你为明日香做了正确的事。现在你把这些都告诉我，也是在做正确的事。"

"Really?" Shinji stared at him.  
"真的吗？" 真嗣盯着他。

"Asuka has done this multiple times in the past." Kaji sighed as he crossed his arms. "She doesn't realize it, but the reason I'm close to her is that I would do the same thing you did for her."  
"明日香过去也多次这样。" 加持叹了口气，双臂交叉。"她没意识到，我之所以与她亲近，正是因为我会像你那样为她挺身而出。"

"So Asuka has always had this problem?"  
"这么说，明日香一直有这个问题？"

"Yes, but she doesn't know about it." Kaji frowned. "It's not exactly something she'd remember since it's only in her sleep. It also doesn't happen that often."  
"是的，但她自己并不知情。" 加持皱眉道，"这不是她会记得的事情，因为它只发生在她睡觉时。而且这种情况也不常发生。"

"Does Misato know?" "美里知道吗？"

"Not sure on that one." Kaji blew smoke from his cigarette. "You let me worry about telling Katsuragi."  
"对那个不太确定。" 加持从香烟中吹出一缕烟雾。"你让我来担心怎么告诉葛城。"

"So, what do I do then?" Shinji raised an eyebrow. "They're going to keep asking me when you take me home, and I don't know what to say to them. Even if you tell Misato, Asuka would still want an answer."  
"那么，我该怎么办呢？" 真嗣挑了挑眉。"你带我回家后，他们还会继续问我，我不知道该怎么回答他们。就算你告诉美里，明日香还是会想要一个答案。"

"I have an idea for that." Kaji smiled. While Kaji was talking to Shinji about everything, Asuka and Misato were back at the apartment. At first, Misato thought Asuka was joking around, but seeing the waffle iron out made her think there was some truth to this.  
"我有个主意。" 加持微笑道。当加持和真嗣谈论这一切时，明日香和美里回到了公寓。起初，美里以为明日香在开玩笑，但看到华夫饼机摆出来，她开始觉得这事儿有点真实了。

"I mean, Shinji has always been helpful with the apartment, but he never goes this far." Misato sat at the dining room table with her arms crossed. "Did anything happen last night?"  
"我的意思是，真嗣一直都很帮忙打理公寓，但他从没这么过分。" 美里双臂交叉坐在餐桌旁。"昨晚发生了什么事吗？"

"Nothing I can think of." Asuka crossed her arms and closed her eyes. "Unless that pervert did something in my sleep and feels guilty about it."  
"我想不出有什么。" 明日香也交叉双臂，闭上了眼睛。"除非那个变态趁我睡着做了什么，然后感到内疚。"

"I doubt that's the reason." Misato sighed. "Shinji knows better than to try something like that."  
"我怀疑不是因为这个。" 美里叹了口气。"真嗣知道不该那样做的。"

"Well, whatever the reason is, I want answers." Asuka paced back and forth. "Ehh! Why did he need to be taken away, right when he was about to tell us!?"  
"好吧，不管是什么原因，我需要答案。" 明日香来回踱步。"诶！为什么他非得在我们即将知道真相的时候被带走！？"

"That does seem strangely convenient..." Misato frowned as she held her chin. "_If this was a trick by Kaji, I'm going to kill him._"  
"这确实显得有些蹊跷..." 美里皱着眉头，托着下巴。"如果这是加持的把戏，我非杀了他不可。"

Just as Misato was thinking about that, the door opened to her apartment. Both Asuka and Misato looked to see who it was.  
就在美里这么想的时候，她公寓的门打开了。明日香和美里都转头看向门口，想知道是谁来了。

"Kaji-san!" Asuka smiled as she put her hands together. "You came over to see me!"  
"加持先生！"明日香笑着双手合十，"你来看我了！"

"There you are!" Misato started stomping towards him. "You better have a good explanation for why you thought you could..."  
"你在这儿啊！" 美里开始朝他大步走来。"你最好有个好理由，解释为什么你以为你可以……"

"Hey, Misato." Shinji appeared beside Kaji.  
"嘿，美里。" 真嗣出现在加持旁边。

"There you are!" Asuka mimicked Misato. "Don't think you'll get out of this! I want answers now!"  
"你在这儿啊！" 明日香模仿着美里。"别以为你能逃掉！我现在就要答案！"

"Actually, it's me that needs to explain." Kaji raised his hand and smiled. "Shinji-kun has been acting weird because of something I told him."  
"实际上，需要解释的是我。" 加持举起手，微笑着说。"真嗣君行为古怪是因为我告诉了他一些事情。"

"What do you mean, Kaji?" Misato stopped and crossed her arms.  
"你什么意思，加持？" 美里停下脚步，交叉双臂。

"Oh, I told Shinji I was worried about Asuka not adapting to life in Japan, and he's been worried if that was the case." Kaji smiled as he scratched the back of his head. "That's why he's been trying to be nicer to Asuka and going out of his way to make her happy."  
"哦，我跟真嗣说我对明日香适应日本生活感到担忧，他就开始担心这是否属实。" 加持笑着挠了挠后脑勺。"这就是为什么他一直在努力对明日香更好，并尽力让她开心。"

"Oh, Kaji-san!" Asuka ran up and hugged him. He instantly hugged her back. "You were really worried about how I was feeling while living here!?"  
"哦，加持先生！" 明日香跑上前去拥抱他。他立刻回抱了她。"你真的很担心我在这里的生活感受吗！？"

"_Of course, she bought that._" Misato stared at him and then looked at Shinji. "_I'll just let it go for now until I can get a real answer._"  
"当然，她信以为真了。" 美里盯着他，然后看向真嗣。"我现在先不追究，等能得到真正答案再说。"

"Well, I should be going now." Kaji broke the hug. "Long day tomorrow, so I want to get some rest early."  
"嗯，我该走了。" 加持松开了拥抱。"明天又是漫长的一天，我想早点休息。"

"Do you really have to go so soon?" Asuka frowned.  
"你真的非得这么快就走吗？" 明日香皱起了眉头。"

"I'm afraid so, but you should thank Shinji for going out of his way for you." Kaji pointed at Shinji, causing Asuka to look at him. "He's the one that asked if there was something he could make for you to make you happy."  
恐怕是的，但你得感谢真嗣特意为你费心。”加持指着真嗣，让明日香看向他。“是他问有没有什么能为你做的，好让你开心。”

"Wait, you asked Kaji-san that so you could do that for me?" Asuka raised her eyebrows. Shinji nodded as he stayed quiet. Asuka sighed. "Well, thank you thi... I mean, Shinji."  
“等等，你问加持先生那些是为了帮我做这个？”明日香挑起眉毛。真嗣点点头，保持沉默。明日香叹了口气。“好吧，谢谢你... 我是说，真嗣。”

Shinji's eyes shot open, surprised. Normally, Asuka would only call him by his designation, but she used his name this time.  
真嗣的眼睛猛地睁开，感到惊讶。通常情况下，明日香只会用他的代号称呼他，但这次她用了他的名字。

"You're welcome." Shinji smiled.  
“不客气。”真嗣微笑着。

"Don't think this will mean I'll start falling for you or anything." Asuka grinned with her eyes closed. "I appreciate the effort. However, my heart belongs to Kaji-san."  
“别以为这会让我开始对你动心什么的。”明日香闭着眼睛咧嘴笑道，“我很感激你的努力。不过，我的心属于加持先生。”

"Later." Kaji turned around and started walking off. "See you tomorrow, Katsuragi."  
"待会儿见。" 加持转过身，开始走开。"明天见，葛城。"

"Yeah, yeah." Misato watched him walking away. She didn't know what he was hiding but figured he'd tell her tomorrow. She sighed and looked at Asuka and Shinji. She smiled as she saw both looked happier than usual. "How bout I take you both out for pizza tonight to celebrate?"  
“是啊，是啊。”美里看着他走开。她不知道他在隐瞒什么，但猜想他明天会告诉她。她叹了口气，看向明日香和真嗣。看到两人看起来比平时更开心，她微笑着提议：“今晚我带你们俩出去吃披萨庆祝一下怎么样？”

"I'd love that." Asuka smiled as she walked to Misato's car. "I get to pick the place, though."  
“我很乐意。”明日香微笑着走向美里小姐的车。“不过，选地方得听我的。”

"Don't I get a say?" Shinji followed her. "You haven't been here that long to know which ones are the best."  
“难道我没有发言权吗？” 真嗣跟着她。“你在这儿待的时间不长，还不知道哪些是最好的。”

"Ehh, Fine! Just pick someplace good or else!"  
“哎，好吧！选个好地方，不然有你好看！”

"Good to see things are still the same as usual." Misato smiled as she walked behind them.  
“看到一切如常，真好。”Misato 微笑着跟在他们身后。

### Chapter 4
It had been a week since defeating the Angel, and Shinji and Asuka were back at school. For the most part, everything was the same as usual. Currently, it was lunchtime, and everyone was getting ready to eat.  
自从击败使徒已经过去了一周，真嗣和明日香回到了学校。大部分时间里，一切如常。现在是午餐时间，大家都准备用餐。

"You made a lunch for me, right?" Asuka walked up next to Shinji's desk.  
“你给我做了便当，对吧？”明日香走到真嗣的桌旁。

"Of course." Shinji pulled out a bento for her.  
“当然。”真嗣拿出一个便当盒递给她。

"What did you pack this time?" Asuka took it from him and looked at it.  
"这次你带了什么？" 明日香从他手中接过，看了看。

"Well, I tried a couple of new things I thought you'd like." Shinji smiled.  
"嗯，我尝试了几样新东西，觉得你会喜欢。" 真嗣微笑道。

"Like what?" Asuka began to open the bento. As Shinji was talking to Asuka, Touji and Kensuke were looking at them.  
"比如什么？" 明日香开始打开便当。与此同时，真嗣在与明日香交谈时，东治和健介正看着他们。

"Is it just me, or is Shinji acting off?" Toji watched him with his arms crossed.  
"是我多心了吗，还是真嗣的行为有点不对劲？" 阿薰双臂交叉，注视着他。

"Maybe Shinji really has a crush on her." Kensuke shrugged. "I can't say I blame him."  
"也许真嗣真的对她有意思。" 健介耸了耸肩。"我倒不觉得奇怪。"

"I swear, there's something wrong with the both of you if that is the case." Toji facepalmed. "I don't know what you and Shinji see in that she-devil."  
"我发誓，如果真是那样，你们俩肯定都有问题。" 阿薰捂脸。"我不知道你们和真嗣在那女魔头身上看到了什么。"

"Hey, be nice." Hikari sat next to them. "Asuka is a friend, and she's actually nice when you get to know her."  
"嘿，友好点。" 光坐在他们旁边。"明日香是朋友，其实你了解她后会发现她很友善。"

"That's what I don't get, though. Look at them." Toji pointed at Shinji and Asuka, and the others turned towards them.  
"可我就是不明白，看他们。" 冬二指着真嗣和明日香，其他人也转向他们。"

"How did you forget to pack me a chocolate bar!?" Asuka stomped her foot and grabbed Shinji's shirt. "I told you I love a snack with my meal, and you forgot it!"  
"你怎么忘了给我带巧克力棒！？" 明日香跺着脚抓住真嗣的衬衫。"我告诉过你我喜欢在餐点时吃点零食，你却忘了！"

"I'm sorry. I thought we had some at home." Shinji looked down as Asuka kept starring at him. "I promise I'll buy some after school today."  
"对不起，我以为家里还有。" 真嗣低头看着明日香，她一直盯着他。"我保证放学后会去买一些。"

"Well, at least you're not just saying sorry as a reflex." Asuka sighed as she sat down and started eating. "You're lucky you're such a good cook."  
"好吧，至少你不是条件反射地说对不起。" 明日香叹了口气，坐下来开始吃饭。"你真幸运，厨艺这么好。"

"Thank you." Shinji smiled as he sat down and started eating.  
"谢谢。" 真嗣微笑着坐下，开始吃饭。

"Okay, I see Toji's point now." Kensuke adjusted his glasses. "When Asuka first came to our school, they would argue. Now he seems to take it whenever she's like that."  
“好吧，我现在明白 Toji 的观点了。” Kensuke 调整了一下眼镜。“当 Asuka 刚来我们学校时，他们会争吵。现在他似乎每次都能忍受她那样。”

"Maybe I should talk to her." Hikari looked at her friend. "I hope she's not taking advantage of Shinji being kind to her."  
“也许我应该和她谈谈。” Hikari 看着她的朋友。“我希望她没有利用 Shinji 对她的善意。”

"I'm going to talk to Shinji too." Toji crossed his arms. "Something's going on, and I want to know what it is."  
“我也打算和 Shinji 谈谈。” Toji 交叉双臂。“有些事情正在发生，我想知道是什么。”

School had ended for the day, and everyone was getting ready to head home. It was another sunny day in Tokyo-3, and everyone was getting ready for whatever they had planned for the rest of the day.  
学校的一天结束了，大家都准备回家。东京-3 又是一个阳光明媚的日子，每个人都准备好了他们计划好的余下活动。

"This time, I'll make sure you don't forget." Asuka was putting her shoes on. "It's not a complete meal unless you have a snack."  
“这次，我会确保你不会忘记。”明日香正在穿鞋。“没有点心，就不算一顿完整的饭。”

"I know." Shinji got his shoes on and was ready to head out. As both exited the school, they heard a familiar voice.  
“我知道。”真嗣穿好鞋，准备出发。两人走出学校时，听到了一个熟悉的声音。

"Hey, Asuka." Hikari walked up as Asuka turned to face her. "Want to hang out? I have a lot of free time today and thought we could do something."  
"嘿，明日香。" 光莉走过来，明日香转身面对她。"想一起玩吗？我今天有很多空闲时间，想着我们可以做点什么。"

"Oh, sure, Hikari." Asuka walked to her and then turned to face Shinji one last time. "As I said, don't forget to buy some chocolate on your way home."  
"哦，当然，光莉。" 明日香走向她，然后最后一次转身面对真嗣。"就像我说的，别忘了回家路上买些巧克力。"

"I'll remember." Shinji smiled as he waved. Asuka just turned away and walked with Hikari. Shinji made his way to the store while Toji was following behind him.  
"我会记住的。" 真嗣微笑着挥手。明日香只是转过身，和光莉一起走开。真嗣朝商店走去，而东治跟在他后面。

"So, how are things with you, Asuka?" Hikari turned to look at her as they walked side by side. "I take it, piloting the Eva is going well."  
"那么，最近怎么样，明日香？" 光转身看着她，两人并肩走着。"我想，驾驶 Eva 一定很顺利吧。"

"Of course it is." Asuka smiled. "With an ace pilot like me, no one has to worry about the Angels."  
"当然顺利。" 明日香微笑道。"有我这样的王牌飞行员在，没人需要担心使徒。"

"That's good." Hikari giggled. "It's nice having another protector and friend."  
"那就好。" 光咯咯笑道。"有另一个守护者和朋友在身边，感觉真好。"

Asuka smiled back at her comment as both of them walked into a clothing store. Both of them were looking through different outfits to try on. Both took a few different ones and walked to the changing room area. Both got into stalls that were side by side.  
明日香对她的话报以微笑，两人一同走进一家服装店。她们各自浏览着不同的服装准备试穿。各自挑选了几件后，走向更衣区。两人分别进入了相邻的试衣间。

"Hey, Asuka, can I ask you something?" Hikari held up a dress she had picked out. It was a light blue sundress.  
"嘿，明日香，我能问你件事吗？" 光手里拿着一件她挑选的裙子，那是一条淡蓝色的太阳裙。

"Sure, what's on your mind?" Asuka started taking off her uniform.  
"当然，你有什么心事吗？" 明日香开始脱下她的制服。

"Ikari has been acting a little different around you. Is everything okay?" Hikari was looking herself over in the dress.  
"碇君在你身边表现得有点不同。一切都还好吗？" 光子在镜子前打量着自己。

"Shinji says he wanted to be nicer because he heard from my sweet Kaji-san that he was worried about me fitting in here." Asuka put on a pair of denim shorts she found. She was also looking herself over in the mirror.  
"真嗣说他想对我好一点，因为他从我亲爱的加持先生那里听说，他担心我在这里适应得怎么样。" 明日香穿上了一条她找到的牛仔短裤。她还在镜子前打量着自己。

"That's why Ikari has been nicer to you?" Hikari raised an eyebrow and looked at the wall where Asuka was changing.  
"这就是为什么碇君对你更好了吗？" 光抬起眉毛，看着明日香正在换衣服的那面墙。

"Yeah, and he's so much better now too." Asuka smiled as she put on a red tank top to go with the denim shorts. "He doesn't just say sorry as an automatic response and is going out of his way to make me happy."  
"是啊，他现在也好多了。" 明日香微笑着穿上一件红色的背心，搭配牛仔短裤。"他不再只是机械地道歉，而是努力让我开心。"

"Like what?" Hikari lifted a dark green dress to try on next.  
"像什么？" 光拿起一件深绿色的裙子，准备试穿。

"Like the first day he started this, he woke up early and made me waffles for breakfast." Asuka smiled as she was trying to pick her next outfit. "Then, the next day, he made us that cake to celebrate me coming here."  
"就像他第一天开始这样做时，他早早起床给我做了华夫饼当早餐。" 明日香微笑着挑选下一套衣服，"然后，第二天，他为我们做了那个蛋糕来庆祝我来到这里。"

"He made that cake?" Hikari raised an eyebrow as she looked at herself in the new dress. "I'll have to ask for his recipe. That cake was delicious."  
"他做的那块蛋糕？" 光看着自己身上的新裙子，挑了挑眉。"我得找他要食谱。那蛋糕真是美味极了。"

"I know, and he also fixed my favorite yellow dress when I ripped it trying to unpack my things." Asuka smiled as she went to look in the mirror with her next outfit. "I didn't even have to ask. He heard me complain and fixed it the next day. It's like he..."  
"我知道，而且我最喜欢的那条黄色裙子被我撕破了，他帮我修好了。" 明日香笑着换上下一套衣服，走到镜子前。"我甚至都没开口。他听到我抱怨，第二天就修好了。就好像他..."

"Like he what?" Hikari turned to look back at the wall. "Asuka? Are you okay?"  
“像他什么？”光转身看向墙壁。“明日香？你还好吗？”

Unknown to Hikari, Asuka froze as she saw herself blushing in the mirror. Asuka felt her face with her hand and felt how warm her cheek felt. Asuka couldn't remember a time talking about someone made her blush. Not even talking about Kaji caused her to be like this.  
光并不知情，当明日香从镜中看到自己脸红的样子时，她愣住了。明日香用手摸了摸脸颊，感受到了那股温热。她记不起有哪次谈论某人会让自己脸红，就连提到加持时也不曾如此。

"Asuka!?" Hikari knocked on the wall. "Please talk to me!"  
"明日香！？" 光敲了敲墙壁。"请跟我谈谈吧！"

"I'm sorry." Asuka shook her head as she put the clothes down. "Hey, let me finish trying these things on, and we'll go get ice cream."  
“对不起。”明日香摇了摇头，放下衣服。“嘿，让我把这些试完，然后我们去吃冰淇淋吧。”

"Okay." Hikari backed away from the wall. "I'm almost done, so I'll only be a minute."  
“好的。”光从墙边退开。“我快完成了，所以只需要一分钟。”

"Got it." Asuka starting changing into a red dress she picked out. She stayed turned away from the mirror as she felt that her face was still warm.  
“明白了。”明日香开始换上她挑选的红色连衣裙。她背对着镜子，感觉自己的脸颊依旧发烫。
