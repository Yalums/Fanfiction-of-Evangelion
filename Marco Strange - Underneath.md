### Chapter 1
Shinji was currently trying to get some sleep. Tomorrow, he and Asuka would get another chance at defeating the Angel. All they had to do was work together for once, but that was easier said than done. He had his eyes close as he laid on his side.  
真嗣此刻正试图入睡。明天，他和明日香将再次有机会击败使徒。他们只需要这一次合作，但说起来容易做起来难。他闭上眼睛，侧身躺着。

"Once this angel is defeated, we can stop being stuck together." Shinji sighed. "What even are the Walls of Jericho that she talked about?"  
"一旦打败这个天使，我们就能不再被束缚在一起了。" 真嗣叹了口气。"她说的耶利哥之墙到底是什么？"

Even after trying for so long, Shinji was unable to fall asleep. He didn't know if he was nervous or if it was one of the many nights he had trouble sleeping, but it annoyed him either way. His focus changed, though, when he heard someone lay down next to him.  
即使尝试了这么久，真嗣还是无法入睡。他不知道自己是紧张还是这只是又一个难以入眠的夜晚，但无论如何都让他感到烦躁。然而，当听到有人躺在他旁边时，他的注意力转移了。

"What the..." He slowly opened his eyes and jumped backward. In front of him was a sleeping Asuka. He sweated as he kept staring at her. "_What in the world is she doing next to me!? I thought she didn't want to be asleep next to me tonight!_"  
"什么鬼..." 他缓缓睁开眼睛，向后一跳。眼前是熟睡的明日香。他一边盯着她，一边冒汗。"她到底在我旁边做什么！？我以为她今晚不想和我一起睡！"

As he was looking at her, he couldn't help but look down at her loose t-shirt. He blushed as he realized Asuka would kill him if she knew he was doing that. He lifted his eyes back to her face, hearing her talking. Luckily, it looked like she was still asleep. He couldn't help but move closer as he thought about kissing her. He couldn't explain why, but he wanted to kiss her while she was in front of him. He slowly leaned in forward as he kept thinking about...  
当他看着她时，目光不由自主地落在了她宽松的 T 恤上。意识到如果明日香知道他在这么做，肯定会杀了他，他的脸颊泛起了红晕。他抬起眼睛回到她的脸上，听着她说话。幸运的是，看起来她还在熟睡。他忍不住向她靠近，心中想着要吻她。他无法解释为什么，但当她就在眼前时，他渴望吻她。他一边想着，一边慢慢地向前倾身...

"M..." Asuka mumbled, making Shinji stop in his tracks. "Mo...Momma..."  
“妈...”明日香喃喃自语，让真嗣停下了动作。“妈...妈妈...”

"Momma?" Shinji raised an eyebrow as he kept looking at her. He jumped as he saw her starting to cry. Before he could react, Asuka rolled to her side.  
“妈妈？”真嗣挑起眉毛，继续看着她。看到她开始哭泣，他吓了一跳。还没等他反应过来，明日香已经翻身侧躺了。

"Momma..." Asuka wept as she faced the other direction. "Why did you leave me, Momma? I need you. I don't have anyone else, momma."  
"妈妈..." 明日香转向另一边哭泣着。"为什么你要离开我，妈妈？我需要你。我没有其他人了，妈妈。"

Shinji gulped as he watched Asuka in her current state. He knew her as overconfident and not afraid of anything. Now he was watching her cry for her mother like a toddler. He couldn't explain why, but he put his arm over her and curled up to her.  
真嗣咽了口唾沫，看着此刻的明日香。他认识的她总是自信满满，无所畏惧。现在他却看到她像个幼儿一样为母亲哭泣。他说不出为什么，但还是伸出手臂搂住她，蜷缩在她身边。

"It's okay." He whispered as he leaned into her ear. "You're not alone."  
"没事的。" 他贴近她的耳朵轻声说。"你并不孤单。"

Asuka started to calm down after Shinji put his arm around her. Shinji could still hear her silently weeping, but he sighed as he saw her sleeping like normal. Without realizing he, Shinji was finally drifting off to sleep.  
在真嗣搂住她之后，明日香开始平静下来。真嗣仍能听到她在默默哭泣，但看到她像往常一样睡着了，他叹了口气。不知不觉中，真嗣也终于渐渐进入了梦乡。

The next day, Shinji rubbed his eyes as he started to wake up.  
第二天，真嗣揉着眼睛开始醒来。

"Man, that was some dream." Shinji slowly opened his eyes and jumped back. He saw Asuka still in front of him. Just like the night before. "So that wasn't a dream then."  
“天啊，那真是个梦。”真嗣缓缓睁开眼睛，猛地向后一跳。他看到明日香仍在他面前。就像昨晚一样。“这么说那不是梦。”

As Shinji looked down at Asuka. A million things were going through his head. He didn't know how to explain to Asuka why she was there, let alone why he was curled up to her like that. Thankfully she was still asleep, but she'd probably be wondering how she went from one room to another. He then looked at the clock and realized it was earlier than they were supposed to get up.  
当真嗣低头看着明日香时，他的脑海中闪过无数念头。他不知道该如何向明日香解释她为何在那里，更别说他为何会那样蜷缩在她身边。幸好她还在熟睡，但她大概会疑惑自己是怎么从一间房到了另一间的。他随后看了看时钟，意识到时间比他们应该起床的时间还要早。

"What in the world am I supposed to do?" He sighed as he knew it would be over an hour before they'd be picked up. He looked back over at Asuka and saw she was still asleep. Right now, his stomach was growling, and figured that he wouldn't be able to go back to sleep. He went to the kitchen and started making himself something to eat. Since he just wanted anything, he had a bowl of cereal. As he ate, he couldn't get what he saw last night out of his head. "Was that the real Asuka I saw last night?"  
“我到底该怎么办？”他叹了口气，知道还要过上一个多小时才会有人来接他们。他回头看向明日香，见她仍在熟睡。此刻，他的肚子咕咕叫，心想自己大概是睡不着了。他走进厨房，开始给自己弄点吃的。既然只想随便吃点什么，他便盛了一碗麦片。吃着吃着，昨晚看到的情景始终挥之不去。“昨晚我看到的是真正的明日香吗？”

Shinji was still thinking about what he should do about what he saw. If he tried talking to Asuka, chances are she'd kill him or just deny it. If he tried telling Misato, Asuka would do the same thing. Part of him started to feel bad thinking that Asuka is like him and feels alone. He finished his cereal and looked back at the clock.  
真嗣还在思考该如何处理他所看到的事情。如果他试图和明日香谈谈，她很可能会杀了他或者干脆否认。如果他告诉美里，明日香也会做出同样的事情。他的一部分开始感到难过，认为明日香和他一样，感到孤独。他吃完麦片，回头看了看时钟。

"Well, I have a lot of time to kill anyway." He stood up and walked to a cupboard.  
“好吧，反正我有很多时间可以消磨。”他站起来，走向一个橱柜。

After some time, Asuka was awoken by the smell of something good. She sat up and rubbed her eyes. She jumped up as she saw where she was.  
过了一会儿，明日香被某种好闻的味道唤醒。她坐起来揉了揉眼睛。当她看到自己在哪里时，她跳了起来。

"Why the hell am I in here!?" Asuka stomped as she went looking for Shinji. "You baka! You better have a good explanation for..."  
"我到底为什么会在这里！？" 明日香一边跺脚一边寻找真嗣。"你这个笨蛋！最好有个像样的解释……"

"Good morning, Asuka." Shinji smiled as he sat a plate down at the table. I woke up early and thought I'd make you breakfast."  
"早上好，明日香。" 真嗣微笑着将一盘食物放在桌上。"我早起了一会儿，想着给你做早餐。"

"You..." Asuka froze as she looked at him and the plate. "You made me that for breakfast?"  
"你……" 明日香看着他和那盘食物，愣住了。"你为我做了这个当早餐？"

"I heard from Kaji awhile ago that you loved waffles. It's my first attempt at trying them, but I thought you'd love some for our fight today."  
"我之前听阿基说你喜欢吃华夫饼。这是我第一次尝试做，但我想你今天会喜欢在战斗中吃点。"

Asuka approached closer and saw what he made for her. There were two homemade waffles, topped with strawberry syrup and fresh-cut strawberries.  
明日香走近一看，发现他为她做了什么。那是两块自制的华夫饼，上面淋着草莓糖浆，还点缀着新鲜切片的草莓。

"You did all this for me?" Asuka stared at the plate. "Even though you're supposed to be focused on the battle?"  
"你为我做了这一切？" 明日香盯着盘子。"即使你应该专注于战斗？"

"Well, I wanted you to be 100 percent and wanted to show I'm happy that we're fighting together."  
"嗯，我希望你能全力以赴，也想表达我很高兴我们能并肩作战。"

"How did you even have a waffle maker to make these?"  
"你哪来的华夫饼机做这些？"

"Misato had it laying around." Shinji giggled. "I just thought it was time to break it out."  
"美里把它放在一边了。" 真嗣咯咯笑道。"我只是觉得是时候拿出来用了。"

Asuka stood there, unsure what to say. She could indeed get whatever she wanted, but no one ever treated her the same way Shinji was. They've spent the last few days usually fighting, and now he's making breakfast and telling her he wants her by his side.  
明日香站在那里，不知该说什么。她的确可以得到任何想要的东西，但没有人像真嗣这样对待她。过去几天他们通常在争吵，而现在他却在做早餐，告诉她希望她在他身边。

"Well, that's great that you did that!" Asuka grinned as she crossed her arms. "Of course, an ace pilot like myself wouldn't need this, but I appreciate the thought that went into it!"  
"嗯，你这么做真是太好了！" 明日香咧嘴一笑，双臂交叉。"当然，像我这样的王牌飞行员不需要这个，但我很感激你的用心！"

"I'm happy to hear that." Shinji continued to smile, making Asuka shocked. He expected him to roll his eyes at her like usual.  
"听到这个我很高兴。" 真嗣继续微笑，这让明日香感到震惊。他本以为他会像往常一样对她翻白眼。

"Well, I still need to brush my teeth either way." Asuka turned away and walked to the bathroom. "Don't you dare think about eating my waffles either, baka!"  
"反正我还是得刷牙。" 明日香转身走向浴室。"你敢打我华夫饼的主意试试，笨蛋！"

"I won't." Asuka took one last look and saw he was still smiling. She just kept walking to the bathroom and quickly closed the door. She then started brushing her teeth.  
"我不会的。" 明日香最后看了一眼，发现他还在微笑。她继续走向浴室，迅速关上门，然后开始刷牙。

"_What in the world is going on with him?_" Asuka looked at herself in the mirror. "_Why did he put all this effort into making me happy? I thought he hated me and was annoyed with our situation._"  
“他到底是怎么回事？”明日香对着镜子中的自己问道，“为什么他费尽心思让我开心？我以为他讨厌我，对我们这种情况感到厌烦。”

Once Asuka brushed her teeth, she rinsed out her mouth and took one last look in the mirror.  
当明日香刷完牙后，她漱了漱口，最后一次对着镜子看了看自己。

"Whatever it is, I'm not going to pass up a tasty breakfast." She smiled as she turned and walked back to the kitchen. "_Hopefully, that baka listened and didn't eat any of my waffles._"  
“不管是什么，我都不会错过美味的早餐。”她笑着转身走回厨房。“希望那个笨蛋听话，没有吃掉我的华夫饼。”

As Asuka walked back in, she saw the waffles were still there, and Shinji was now in the living room. Asuka decided to ask him about it later and eat her breakfast. She sat down and began cutting off a piece of a waffle. She put it in her mouth and almost screamed in joy from how good it tasted. She continued to eat it until it was completely gone.  
当明日香走回来时，她看到华夫饼还在那里，而真嗣现在在客厅。明日香决定稍后再问他，先享用早餐。她坐下来，开始切下一块华夫饼。她把它放进嘴里，差点因为它的美味而欢呼出声。她继续吃，直到完全吃完。
