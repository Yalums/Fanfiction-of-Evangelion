[The Silent One1](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/213531/The-Silent-One1)
"NO, NO DON'T LOOK INTO MY MIIIIIIINNNNNNNNDDDDDD!"
不，不，别窥探我的心灵！

Shinji gripped the handles inside Eva Unit 01's entry plug until he felt sure that his knuckels were white from the force he exerted.
真嗣紧握着初号机插入栓内的把手，直到他确信自己的指关节因用力而变得苍白。

"FATHER! LET ME GO UP AND FIGHT!" He pleded with the remorseless man who sired him.
“父亲！让我上去战斗吧！”他向那个冷酷无情的生父恳求道。

"No, apparently this angel has the ability to contaminate a pilots mind. We cannot risk exposing Unit 01."
“不行，显然这个使徒有能力污染驾驶员的心智。我们不能冒险让初号机暴露。”

"And what about Asuka?" Misato Katsuragi asked from lower down on the command bridge.
"那明日香怎么办？" 葛城美里在指挥桥较低的位置问道。

"Send Rei to retrieve the Lance."
"派绫波去取回朗基努斯之枪。"

"A spear? What the hell is a spear going to do to help Asuka." Shinjis thoughts echoed wildly in his mind, he had to protect Asuka, because even though he never showed it to anyone, even her; he cared and dare say loved the firey girl more than anything else in the world. He dropped his head and repeated his litany once more in his mind. He needed it now more than ever to help gather his meager amount of courage and strength.
"一把矛？一把矛能对帮助明日香有什么用？" 真嗣的思绪在脑海中狂乱回响，他必须保护明日香，因为尽管他从未向任何人，甚至是她表露过，但他对这位火热的女孩的关心和爱，可以说超过了世界上任何其他事物。他低下头，再次在心中重复他的祷告。他现在比以往任何时候都更需要它来帮助聚集他那微薄的勇气和力量。

"I musn't run away. I musn't run away. I MUSN'T RUN AWAY!!......................................................I won't...I will not run away when Asuka needs me the most." Shinji opened his eyes and stared at his guardian and friend for the past four months of his life. Out of all the people gathered on that bridge, she was the one who deserved to hear him once more before he left.
"我不能逃跑。我不能逃跑。我绝对不能逃跑！！......................................................我不会...当明日香最需要我的时候，我不会逃跑。" 真嗣睁开眼睛，凝视着过去四个月里他的监护人和朋友。在桥上聚集的所有人中，她是唯一一个在他离开前应该再次听到他声音的人。

"Misato."

The sudden calmness of Shinji's voice caused everyone on the bustling command bridge to stop their frantic efforts and stare at the steely eyed boy who carried the weight of humanity on his shoulders more than once.
真嗣声音中突如其来的平静让繁忙的指挥桥上的每个人都停止了他们疯狂的努力，转而注视着那个多次肩负人类重担、目光坚定的男孩。

"Y...yes, Shinji?"

"Goodbye, my friend. I will miss you. Tell Asuka...tell her that I love her." With that, the signel cut off and Eva Unit 01 activated within its steel prison.
"再见，我的朋友。我会想念你的。告诉明日香...告诉她我爱她。" 说完，信号切断了，Eva 初号机在其钢铁牢笼中激活了。

Asuka curled herself up within the entry plug, she had tried to block the intrusive probes into her past and memories; but she couldn't stop the attack. She felt violated, filthy, unclean and soiled.
明日香蜷缩在插入栓内，她试图阻挡那些侵入她过去和记忆的探针；但无法阻止攻击。她感到被侵犯，肮脏，不洁且污秽。

"...help me...please, Kaji help me..." Silent tears rolled off her cheek and landed in her lap, slowly diluted by the LCL that filled her lungs and the entry plug. She didn't know what was left for her to do...except wait for death. But death did not come; Eva 01, however, did. With a crash and the feeling of having a dagger pulled out of her temple, Asuka looked up to find herself out of the horrible beam of light and in the soft rain coming from the gray clouds above. She cryed harder when she saw the figure that now occupied her place in that light, the light of a vengeful God...Shinji stood there, bathed in that soft light within the cold outer shell of Evangelion Unit 01.
"...救救我...求你了，加持先生救救我..." 无声的泪水从她的脸颊滑落，落在她的膝上，慢慢被充满肺部和插入栓的 LCL 稀释。她不知道自己还能做什么...除了等待死亡。但死亡并未降临；取而代之的是初号机。随着一声巨响和仿佛从太阳穴拔出匕首的感觉，明日香抬头发现自己已脱离那可怕的光束，置身于灰色云层上飘落的细雨中。当她看到那光束中占据她位置的身影时，她哭得更厉害了——那是复仇之神的光芒中的真嗣...他站在那里，沐浴在那柔和的光线中，身处冰冷的初号机外壳之内。

"Sh--Shinji...you came...came to s-save me." Several more tears rolled from her eyes as she stared at the motionless from of the one she silently loved. Then without warning, the light dissapeared from the sky, leaving Unit 01 dark and menacing in the rain that poured down on it from above. Her systems flared to life, and Misato's face and voice appeared in one of her communication lines.
"Sh--Shinji...你来了...来救我了。" 她凝视着她默默爱着的那个人静止的身影，几滴泪水再次从她的眼中滚落。突然间，天空中的光芒消失了，留下零号机在倾盆大雨中显得黑暗而凶险。她的系统突然启动，美里和她的声音出现在其中一个通讯线路中。

"...Asuka!...Asuka! You're alive, thank God! Are you alright?"
"...明日香!...明日香! 你还活着，感谢上帝！你还好吗？"

"I-I'm fine...What about Shinji? What happened to him and the angel?" She asked, a faint glimmer of regret and concern appearing in her eyes. Much to Misatos regret, she saw these glimmers and was forced to cast her eyes and head down.
"我...我没事...那真嗣呢？他和使徒怎么了？" 她问道，眼中闪过一丝悔恨和担忧。令美里遗憾的是，她看到了这些闪光，不得不垂下眼睛和头。

"Misato! What...happened to him?"
"碇司令！他...他怎么了？"

"He's gone. Everything, him...and even his plugsuit. Ritsuko says that the analisis of the LCL reads negative...I'm so sorry Asuka."
"他消失了。所有的一切，包括他和他的插入栓服。律子说 LCL 的分析结果是阴性...真对不起，明日香。"

Fresh tears of sadness and regret flowed down her cheeks, and she made no attempt to hide them as she sobbed aloud in the entry plug.
悲伤与悔恨的新泪顺着她的脸颊流下，她在插入栓内放声哭泣，毫不掩饰。

"Asuka..." Misato waited until the sobs abided and those ice blue eyes of the German girl raised up enough for her to see them. "He told me something before he left...he said...Tell Asuka that I-I love her..."
"明日香..." 直到那德国女孩的啜泣声渐息，冰蓝色的眼眸抬起足以让她看见时，葛城才开口。"他离开前告诉我一些话...他说...告诉明日香，我-我爱她..."

"..."

"Retreval crew are coming for you Asuka...I'm sorry."
"回收小组正在前往你那里，明日香...对不起。"

The plug went dark as the entry plug shut down in preperation to be ejected. And all Asuka could think about was all the times she had scorned him, rejected him, insulted him...she started once more to cry in the plug.
随着插入栓准备弹射，驾驶舱陷入黑暗。而明日香满脑子都是自己曾经如何轻视他、拒绝他、侮辱他的场景...她再次在插入栓内哭泣起来。

"Where am I?" Shinji Ikari said aloud in the solid white room he lay in. No answer came. Wondering how he got there, he stood on the plane of nothingness that he found himself laying on and slowly looked around at his surroundings. Vast emptyness surrounded him, stretching for endless amounts of infinity in every direction man could percive.
"我在哪儿？" 碇真嗣在这片纯白的房间中大声问道，无人回应。他疑惑自己如何来到这里，便站起身来，在这片虚无的平面上缓缓环顾四周。无垠的空旷环绕着他，向着人类所能感知的每一个方向无限延伸。

"How did I get here?" He asked the air softly.
"我是怎么来到这里的？" 他轻声向空气发问。

"You died."

Shinji jumped at the sudden voice behind him, and spun around in the void to face the speaker.
身后突如其来的声音让真嗣吓了一跳，他在虚空中迅速转身，面向说话者。

"Who are you?!" He demanded of the speaker.
"你是谁?!" 他向说话者质问道。

"I am an angel." "我是一个天使。"

"What?"

Shinji stepped back and looked at the small boy that looked to be around his age. The boy had gray hair and red eyes, with a slight build of musculature on his thin frame. He also had a pair of black feathered wings that streached a good twenty feet across the void.
真嗣后退一步，打量着眼前这个看起来和他年纪相仿的小男孩。男孩有着灰色的头发和红色的眼睛，瘦弱的身躯上略显肌肉线条。他还有一对黑色的羽毛翅膀，在虚空中展开足有二十英尺宽。

"Well, a fallen messenger to be more precise. My name is Abraham, although you lilim call me the third angel."
"嗯，确切地说，是一个堕落的使者。我名叫亚伯拉罕，尽管你们这些莉莉姆称我为第三天使。"

"The third?..but, I killed...you?"
"第三？...但是，我杀死了...你？"

"Yes, and I died. This, however, is not heaven so don't think for one second that it is."
"是的，我确实死了。然而，这里并非天堂，所以别以为这是天堂。"

"Then, is it hell?" "那么，这里是地狱吗？"

"NO! No, its not...This is a pocket void. A place of storage and of solitude for those who seek it."
"不！不，这不是……这是一个口袋虚空。一个为寻求它的人提供存储和独处的空间。"

"Why am I here?" Shinji gestured with his hands.
"我为什么会在这里？" 真嗣用手势示意道。

"You are here to prepare yourself Shinji Ikari. You are here to finish your fight with the last angel, Jacob."
"你来这里是为了准备自己，碇真嗣。你来这里是为了与最后一个天使雅各布完成你的战斗。"

"More fighting?" Shinji's legs buckled underneath him and he slumped down into a sitting position. "I'm tired of fighting...it got me nothing and...and, oh what could you know about my troubles?"
"还要战斗吗？" 真嗣的双腿一软，他瘫坐下来。"我已经厌倦了战斗...它什么也没给我，还有...还有，你又怎能理解我的烦恼呢？"

"I know that you left a loved one behind, and so does God. That is why you were given a second chance to return and fight." Abraham folded in his wings to the sides and helped Shinji to his feet. "And that's why I'm here to help you."
"我知道你留下了一个所爱之人，上帝也知道。这就是为什么你被给予第二次机会回来战斗。" 亚伯拉罕收起翅膀，扶真嗣站起来。"这也是我在这里帮助你的原因。"

"Asuka...its been nearly two months...please, talk to me?" Misato Katsuragi stood outside the door of what used to be Shinji's room. Ever since the last angel dissapeared along with Shinji, Asuka had taken up sleeping in his room, moving nothing and touching very little. Sometimes Misato could hear her crying in the deep hours of night, it hurt a lot for her to listen. Not that she hadn't had her own problems too. A week after he had left, she became so drunk that she was poisoned by the alcohal. Only Asuka's quick thinking and fast driving had saved her from an untimely death. Misato had been sober for a month and a half now.
"明日香...已经快两个月了...求你，跟我说说话吧？" 葛城美里站在曾经是真嗣房间的门外。自从最后一个使徒与真嗣一同消失后，明日香就搬进了他的房间，里面的一切都保持原样，几乎未曾触碰。有时美里在深夜能听到她的哭声，这让她非常心痛。当然，她自己也有不少烦恼。真嗣离开一周后，她因酗酒过度而酒精中毒。多亏了明日香的机智和迅速驾驶，才让她免于过早离世。美里已经戒酒一个半月了。

"Asuka, I'm coming in...alright?"
明日香，我要进来了...可以吗？

The door slid back to reveal Asuka sitting on the side of Shinji's bed, looking at a small picture in a silver frame. A small glint of light fell from her face to land quietly on the glass cover of the picture.
门缓缓滑开，露出坐在真嗣床边的明日香，她正凝视着一个小小的银色相框里的照片。一丝微光从她的脸颊滑落，静静地落在照片的玻璃盖上。

"She's crying again." Misato thought with pity.
"她又在哭了。" 惋惜地想着。

"Why?"

"Asuka, why what?" "明日香，为什么什么？"

"Why didn't he tell me sooner...why didn't he TELL ME?!" Asuka shouted the last two words and looked at her friend and guardian. Misato grimaced slightly as she saw the dark rings under her 15 year old ward's eyes. Soon those eyes teared over again, and she collapsed inward shaking with sobs. Misato quickly rushed over to her side and wrapped her in a warm embrace, the pair stayed that way for nearly two hours; slowly rocking back and forward.
"为什么他不早点告诉我...为什么他不告诉我？！" 明日香喊出最后两个字，看着她的朋友和监护人。看到她 15 岁养女眼下的黑眼圈，惣流微微皱眉。很快，那些眼睛再次泛起泪光，她崩溃地抽泣起来。惣流迅速冲到她身边，用温暖的怀抱将她紧紧抱住，两人就这样持续了近两个小时，缓缓地前后摇晃。

"Shinji Ikari, this place will be the center of your world until you are ready to return and fight Jacob, if that takes you a year, two, or even a thousand; you will have to return to the world of the living and fight him."
"碇真嗣，这个地方将成为你世界的中心，直到你准备好回去与雅各布战斗，无论这需要你一年、两年，甚至一千年；你都必须回到现实世界并与之战斗。"

"With what? The Eva? A lot of good the Eva did for me and Asuka when we fought him the last time!"
"用什么？用 Eva？上次我们和他战斗时，Eva 对我自己和明日香的帮助微乎其微！"

"No, no the Evangelions will no longer be needed to fight the last three angels."
"不，不，对抗最后三个使徒，Eva 将不再需要。"

"You sound sure of yourself." Shinji muttered sarcasticly as he once again sank to his knees and tried to remember Asuka.
"你听起来很自信嘛。" 真嗣讽刺地嘟囔着，再次跪倒在地，试图回忆起明日香。

"And God decreed that the last three mesengers of fate would take the forms of men, and they would be fought by a man of truth and valor if one could be found and brought forth. And this man would carry tools of his own make, and use them to fight the three, until he died...or until they failed. Do you know where that comes from Shinji?"
"上帝规定，命运的最后三位使者将以男性的形态出现，而他们将由一位真理与勇气并存的人来对抗，如果这样的人能够被找到并被召唤出来。这个人将携带自己制造的工具，用它们与这三位使者战斗，直到他死去……或者直到他们失败。你知道这是出自哪里吗，真嗣？"

"No, but you're going to answer that aren't you?"
"不知道，但你不是要告诉我答案吗？"

"Yes...it comes from the Dead Sea Scrolls...the same scrolls that made your father search for Adam, the same scrolls that made a three thousand year old society fund a small paramilitary organization and armed them with the false Adams: the Evangelions."
"是的...它来自死海古卷...正是这些古卷促使你的父亲寻找亚当，也是这些古卷让一个拥有三千年历史的社团资助了一个小型准军事组织，并为他们配备了虚假的亚当：即福音战士。"

"So all of my actions were planned out on a piece of three thousand year old paper...then why am I dead?"
"所以，我的一切行动都是按照一张三千年前的纸张预先规划好的...那我为何会死去？"

"The scrolls never said the man was alive."
"古卷从未提及那个人是活着的。"

Both Shinji and Abraham stared at each other for what seemed like an eternity, soon though, Shinji rose to his feet and asked the fallen messenger a question.
新二和亚伯拉罕相互凝视了仿佛永恒般的一刻，不久，新二站起身来，向那位堕落的天使提出了一个问题。

"If I go back, will I be able to stay until my natural death?"
“如果我回去，我能活到自然死亡吗？”

"Your life will be restored to you, and your ressurection will return you to what your natural body would look like if it had never dissapeared." Abraham assured Shinji. Shinji looked at his sneakered feet for a moment and then back up at Abraham.
“你的生命将被恢复，你的复活将使你回到如果身体从未消失时的自然模样。”亚伯拉罕向新二保证道。新二低头看了看自己穿着运动鞋的双脚，然后又抬头望向亚伯拉罕。

"I'll do it." He held out his hand and was met by a firm, warm grasp from the angel. "But...how will I fight him? I have no tools or weapons on me?"
"我来吧。" 他伸出手，立刻被天使坚定而温暖的手掌握住。"但是...我怎么和他战斗？我身上没有任何工具或武器啊？"

"That is because you must make them first." Abraham gestured behind Shinji, who upon turning around found himself looking into an anchient blacksmiths shop from the thirteenth century. "You'll need to make yourself a decent set of armor...not to mention a strong sword."
"那是因为你得先制造它们。" 亚伯拉罕指向新二身后，新二转身一看，发现自己正面对着一个十三世纪的古老铁匠铺。"你需要为自己打造一套像样的盔甲...还有一把坚固的剑。"

It had been two and a half years since the boy known as Shinji Ikari had dissapeared in the human creation Evangelion. Asuka regretted every hour of that time because of what she and he had failed to do. Now, standing on the roof of the building next to which both she and he had been attacked by the fifthteenth angel, Asuka Langely Sohryu silently looked at the empty space where Unit 01 had stood before.
自从名为碇真嗣的少年在人类创造的福音战士中消失，已经过去了两年半。明日香因为她和他在那段时间未能做到的事情，每时每刻都感到后悔。此刻，她站在那栋大楼的屋顶上，旁边就是她和真嗣被第十五使徒袭击的地方，明日香·兰格雷·索拉尔静静地凝视着零号机曾经站立的空地。

"Shinji," She called out softly. "I'm sorry that I treated you the way I did. I'm sorry that I didn't pay closer attention to you. And I'm sorry that we never talked to each other when we both knew that we loved each other. I still love you Shinji, you'll always be my one and only Baka...I just wish that I could see you again..." She stopped talking at this point and started to cry her silent, remorseful tears of anguish.
"真嗣，" 她轻声呼唤，"对不起，我那样对待你。对不起，我没有更细心地关注你。还有，对不起，我们明明都知道彼此相爱，却从未交谈过。我依然爱你，真嗣，你永远是我唯一的大笨蛋...我只希望还能再见你一面..." 说到这里，她停止了话语，开始无声地流下悔恨与痛苦的泪水。

Shinji ducked and pivoted on the balls of his feet, quickly swinging around to face his imaginary opponent in the vast void of the pocket dimension. Moving quickly and with the speed drilled into his taller and heavily muscled frame of nearly three years, he thrust and spun his finely forged sword through the white null of his existance. He flipped easily into the air and landed as gracefully and as silently as a cat back on his feet, facing the opposite direction and raising his sword to block an imaginary downcut of his false opponents blade. He crouched when he completed the movement and brought his swords blade down in a arcing sweep to his foes midsection. Sweat dripped from his nose as he stood still in the final stage of the movement, his muscles not moving the tip a millimeter. A sudden clapping brought him back to the situation at present.
真嗣脚尖点地，迅速转身，面对着口袋维度中广阔虚空里的假想敌。他以近三年来锤炼出的高大健硕身躯所具备的速度，快速移动，挥舞着精工锻造的剑，穿透了存在的苍白虚无。他轻盈地翻跃至空中，如猫儿般无声无息地落回地面，转向相反方向，举剑格挡假想敌劈下的虚幻一击。完成动作后，他蹲伏下来，剑刃划出一道弧线，横扫向对手的腰腹。静止于动作的最后一刻，汗水从鼻尖滴落，肌肉紧绷，剑尖纹丝不动。突然响起的掌声将他拉回到现实情境之中。

"Bravo, bravo Shinji. That was most excellent, does the armor slow you down at all?" Abraham asked as he approached from the side of infinite space. As the lad of 17 shook his head from side to side, Abraham could only note how much more the boy had matured while he was trapped in the void. Shinji had grown quite a deal in the three years since his death, and his 5' 10" frame was now covered by a swarth of muscle from the daily workouts he had endured for nearly a year. His hair had grown out a length too, nearly reaching the middle of his shoulderblades and bound up by a piece of leather to put it in a controlled ponytail. Another stark contrast to the 14 year old who died what seemed like so long ago was the shined and gleaming armor that covered his shoulders, chest, stomach, and back.
"好样的，真嗣，干得漂亮。这身盔甲会让你行动迟缓吗？" 亚伯拉罕从无尽空间的边缘走来，问道。17 岁的少年摇了摇头，亚伯拉罕只能感慨，自从被困在虚空之中，这孩子成熟了许多。真嗣自三年前去世以来，成长了不少，他那 5 英尺 10 英寸的身躯如今覆盖着一层肌肉，这是他近一年来每天锻炼的结果。他的头发也长长了，几乎垂到肩胛骨中部，用一根皮带束成一个整齐的马尾。与那个似乎很久以前死去的 14 岁少年形成鲜明对比的，还有他肩上、胸前、腹部和背上闪闪发光的盔甲。

"He looks a lot like Ryoji Kaji with that stubble too." Abraham noted silently as he watched Shinji run his hands over the four days worth that had collected on his face. "Well, I do belive that now is the time for you to decide what to do next."
"他留着胡茬的样子，和加持良治很像。" 亚伯拉罕默默地观察着，只见真嗣用手抚摸着脸上四天未剃的胡须。"嗯，我相信现在是你决定接下来做什么的时候了。"

"What do you mean Abraham?" Shinji said in a neutral, controlled voice.
"你指的是什么，亚伯拉罕？" 真嗣用一种中立、克制的声音说道。

"If you are ready, you can return at any time. But you must decide when."
"如果你准备好了，随时都可以回去。但你必须决定何时回去。"

"You mean, I can return? Now?"
"你是说，我可以回去？现在？"

"Yes...I hate to see you go, but prophecy can't wait forever."
"是的...我不愿你离开，但预言不能永远等待。"

"I thought you said that I could stay here a thousand years and still return to fight the remaining three." Shinji said as he sheathed the sword, narrowing his eyes at his friend and compatriot of three years.
"我以为你说过，我可以在这里待上一千年，然后还能回去对付剩下的三个。" 真嗣边说边收剑入鞘，眯起眼睛看着与他并肩作战三年的朋友和战友。

"Oh, did I say that?"
"哦，我说过这话吗？"

"Yes...but it doesn't matter. I AM, ready to go home...to Misato, to Rei, to Toji and Kensuke, and to...to Asuka."
"是的...不过没关系。我确实，准备回家了...回到美里那里，回到绫波那里，回到东治和健介那里，还有...回到明日香那里。"

Abraham crossed over to Shinji and placed his hands on the boys shoulders.
亚伯拉罕走到真嗣身边，将双手放在男孩的肩膀上。

"My boy...no, you're no longer a boy...all that you have been through, all that you have sacrificed has made you a man. A true warrior poet you are Shinji Ikari...and before you go, I have one last parting gift for you."
我的孩子……不，你已不再是孩子……你所经历的一切，你所牺牲的一切，使你成为了一个真正的男人。真嗣·碇，你是一位真正的战士诗人……在你离开之前，我还有最后一份临别赠礼给你。

"What is it?" 那是什么？

"This will hurt a bit..." Abraham quickly chanted a few words and both Shinji and he were suddenly encased in a glow of blue-white light. A scream resonated throughout the void as Shinji felt his skin alongside his shoulderblades tearing open and the bone underneath spreading and reshaping into something new. A grind of metal followed by a what could only be described as a sword cutting trough a sheet of silk soon followed after the scream.
"这会有些痛..." 亚伯拉罕迅速念了几句咒语，随即他和真嗣被一团蓝白色的光芒笼罩。随着真嗣感觉到自己的皮肤连同肩胛骨撕裂开来，下方的骨头开始扩散并重塑成新的形态，一声尖叫在虚空中回荡。紧接着是一阵金属摩擦声，随后是一种只能形容为剑划过丝绸的声音。

"I am sorry Shinji, but all things come with some, if even small, amounts of pain." Abraham said steping away and admiaring his handywork, with Gods blessing of course. Shinji said nothing at all, but instead reached out and grabbed one of the many floating white feathers that eminated from the pair of wings that sprouted from his back.
"对不起，真嗣，但所有事情都伴随着一些，哪怕是微小的痛苦。" 亚伯拉罕说着，退后一步欣赏自己的杰作，当然，这是在神的祝福下。真嗣一言不发，只是伸出手抓住了从他背后长出的那对翅膀上飘落的众多白色羽毛中的一片。

"I...I have wings like an angel. Why?"
"我...我有了像天使一样的翅膀。为什么？"

"God has blessed you. And with blessings of great power upon the dead, he has made you an angel. Not a messenger, but a true angel."
"上帝已赐福于你。他以强大的力量祝福亡者，使你成为天使。并非信使，而是真正的天使。"

Slowly, understanding and peace spread across Shinji's face, and with a small grimace of pain the wings retracted through the slots in his armor and reshaped themselves into his skin.
渐渐地，理解和宁静在真嗣的脸上蔓延开来，伴随着一丝痛苦的扭曲，翅膀从他盔甲的缝隙中缩回，重新融入他的皮肤。

"Shinji...I wish you luck. Although I grieve that we became enemies out of necessity, I will remember our time here, and hope that you succede. Goodbye Shinji." The two beings clasped each others hands in a firm grip and hugged for a short amount of time before they both were overcome by another flash of light. Then they were gone.
"真嗣...祝你好运。尽管我因必要而悲伤地与你成为敌人，但我将铭记我们在此的时光，并希望你成功。再见，真嗣。"两位生灵紧紧握住对方的手，短暂拥抱后，他们再次被一道光芒笼罩，随即消失无踪。

"OH MY GOD!" Aoba Shigeru lept out of his seat in the once bustling command bridge and quickly rechecked all of the Magi's sensory readings. It was exactly three years since the last angel had dissapeared along with Shinji Ikari, and now if what he was reading was correct, there were two blue patterns showing up in the heart of Tokyo-3. He activated the citywide PA system and hit a large red button off to the side.
"哦，我的天哪！" 青葉茂从曾经繁忙的指挥桥上一跃而起，迅速重新检查了所有 MAGI 的传感读数。自从最后一个使徒与碇真嗣一同消失以来，已经整整三年了，而现在，如果他读取的数据无误，东京-3 的心脏地带出现了两个蓝色信号。他激活了全市公共广播系统，并按下了旁边的一个大红色按钮。

"Attention all civilian personell. Report to your underground shelters immediatly. I repeat, report to the shelters immediatly. TWO, REPEAT, TWO ANGELS HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED WITHIN TOKYO-3! ALL NERV PERSONELL RETURN TO BASE. THIS IS NO DRILL!"
"所有平民人员请注意。立即前往地下避难所。重复，立即前往避难所。确认东京-3 内出现两个使徒！重复，两个使徒！所有 NERV 人员返回基地。这不是演习！"

Asuka Langley Sohryu, now aged seventeen and looking even more beatuiful and ravashing as ever stood on the building nearby which Unit 01 had stood three years earlier. She had heard the announcement and noticed all of the people leaving the area quickly and efficiently, but she did not leave. For across the strech of road and on buildings eaqually as tall as hers stood two beings wearing armor and carring heavy swords. One of the beings had wings of coal black feathers, and the other looked for all purposes as a man who came from the past.
Asuka Langley Sohryu，如今已十七岁，比以往任何时候都更加美丽动人，她站在那座建筑旁，三年前，Unit 01 曾屹立于此。她听到了公告，注意到所有人都在迅速而有序地离开该区域，但她没有离开。因为在马路对面，与她所在建筑同样高耸的楼顶上，站着两个身着盔甲、手持重剑的生物。其中一个生物拥有乌黑羽毛的翅膀，而另一个则看起来像是从过去穿越而来的男子。

Shinji stood on the building with his shining armor heating slowly in the warm afternoon sun. Underneath his shoulder greaves he had chosen to wear a ankel long, sleevless brown robe of a rough cotton. He slowly looked around to see if he still remembered everything about the world he had left from unwillingly, and in his glances he noticed one curious onlooker on a nearby skyscraper. The wind picked up then and whipped his shoulder long hair and his loose robe around to the left as it also carried over the voice of the messenger of God.
Shinji 站在楼顶，他那闪亮的盔甲在温暖的午后阳光下渐渐发热。在他的肩甲下，他选择穿了一件及踝的、无袖的粗糙棉质棕色长袍。他缓缓环顾四周，试图确认自己是否还记得那个他曾不情愿离开的世界的一切，而在他的扫视中，他注意到附近一座摩天大楼上有一位好奇的旁观者。此时，风突然加大，将他齐肩的头发和宽松的长袍向左吹去，同时也带来了神的使者的声音。

"So redeemed one. Do you care to fight for the fate of man again?" Called the black winged angel across the chasm of buildings. Turning his eyes away from the innocent person to the angel of the mind, he called back his reply challenge.
"那么，被救赎者啊，你可愿再次为人类的命运而战？" 黑翼天使在建筑间的深渊对面呼唤。他移开目光，不再注视那无辜之人，转向心灵的天使，回应挑战。

"Yes Jacob. I am ready to face you today. And today we finish the fight from three years before!"
"是的，雅各布。我今天已准备好与你对决。今天，我们要了结三年前的战斗！"

Without another word Shinji ran from the center of the roof he was on and lept headfirst into the air.
没有多言，真嗣从屋顶中央疾奔而出，头朝下跃入空中。

Asuka shouted out in suprise as the armored man jumped into the air, and then tried to shout a warning to him about the winged being flying down and following him. What happened next suprised her enough to force her to her knees as she watched.
明日香惊呼一声，只见那身披铠甲的男子一跃而起，她急忙想要向他发出警告，提醒他注意那正俯冲而来的带翼生物。接下来发生的一幕让她震惊至极，不由自主地跪倒在地，目睹着一切。

Shinji fell ten stories before he heard a scream echo from off of the concrete buildings beside him.
真嗣从十层楼高处坠落，耳边突然传来一声尖叫，回荡在旁边的混凝土建筑之间。

"That sounded like...like Asuka."
那声音听起来像是……像是明日香。

Immediatly he brought up the image of himself with the newly acquired wings to his foremind and was rewarded by a small twinge of pain followed by a rip of cloth as they shredded through the cotton robe. Spreading them wide he slowed his descent and rotated upwards just in time to catch the descending sword that had been aimed at his back. Sparks flew from the enjoined blades and the pair of angels, one fallen and one redeemed, fell rapidly to the ground.
他立刻在脑海中唤起自己新获翅膀的影像，随即感到一阵轻微的痛楚，紧接着是布料撕裂的声音，翅膀穿透了棉质长袍。他展开双翼，减缓了下落速度，并及时旋转身体，接住了原本瞄准他背部的下落之剑。两剑相交，火花四溅，两位天使——一位堕落，一位被救赎——急速坠向地面。

"Fight me pure one. Fight for the lifes you failed to protect before!" Jacob taunted and goaded Shinji as they fell. Anger flared in Shinji's eyes, and something happened that startled the fallen angel immensly. The eyes of Shinji Ikari glazed over and became filled by a blue white flame that seeped out of the corners only to disperse a few centimeters away from their sources. Shinji spun his sword through the air and forced the two blades apart before coming back down across the armored breastplate of Jacob. The angel gave a shrill cry of pain as the edge cut cleanly and sharply across his left breast and then trailed down to his right ribcage. Blood the color of LCL flowed out of the wound as Shinji completed the downstroke and furiously flapped his angelic wings in order to slow his descent. Jacob, through the haze of pain, copied Shinji but both slammed hard enough into the ground to cause impressions of their boots to show in the asphalt.
"跟我战斗吧，纯洁之人。为了你之前未能保护的生命而战！" 雅各布嘲讽并挑衅着真嗣，两人一同坠落。真嗣的眼中怒火中烧，发生了令堕落天使极为震惊的一幕。真嗣·伊卡里的双眼变得模糊，被一种蓝白色的火焰充满，火焰从眼角渗出，仅在几厘米外消散。真嗣在空中旋转他的剑，迫使两把剑分开，然后猛地向下劈向雅各布的装甲胸甲。天使发出尖锐的痛苦叫声，剑锋干净利落地划过他的左胸，然后向下延伸至右肋骨。伤口中流出 LCL 颜色的血液，真嗣完成下劈动作后，愤怒地拍打他的天使翅膀以减缓下落速度。雅各布在痛苦中模仿真嗣，但两人都重重地撞在地面上，以至于在柏油路上留下了他们靴子的印记。

"Not bad..." Jacob said sounding slightly strained as he licked his angelic blood coated fingers. "Not bad at all redeemed. But to kill me you must do better than that."
"不错..." 雅各布说着，声音略显吃力，他舔了舔沾满天使血液的手指。"确实不错，被救赎者。但要想杀我，你得做得更好才行。"

With the fire still curling slightly around the sides of his face, Shinji mearly nodded and raised up his sword into a defensive position. Then the two began to dance. Jacob led off with a sweeping cut down aimed at cleaving Shinji in two pieces, which was deftly blocked and diverted to the side were it only tore the robe that swirled around Shinji's feet. Shinji counterattacked by sweeping down at the exposed right shoulder and smiled grimly as it landed a decent, if glancing, blow that drew out more blood. The angel flapped his wings and was sent flying backwards down the deserted street, a trail of LCL following him.
火焰仍在他的脸颊旁微微卷曲，真嗣只是微微点头，将剑举至防御姿态。随后，两人开始了一场战斗之舞。雅各布率先发起攻势，一记横扫试图将真嗣劈成两半，却被巧妙地挡开并偏移，仅撕裂了真嗣脚边飘动的长袍。真嗣随即反击，剑锋直指对方暴露的右肩，当剑尖划出一道虽浅却足以见血的伤口时，他露出了冷酷的微笑。天使振翅高飞，向后倒飞在空无一人的街道上，身后留下一串 LCL 的痕迹。

"Come back HERE!" “给我回来！”

Shinji unfurled his wings and sped quickly to rejoin the fight. With a skirl and clash of steel on steel, the two holy combatants met again and then broke apart. They floated silently five meters off of the ground for a good minute before they both broke in opposite directions flying as fast as they could. After a few seconds, both angels banked sharply and skimmed across the facade fronts of the skyscrapers surrounding them speeding for each other once again. With flashes of glinting metal too fast to be seen normally, the two swords met, sought an opening, and struck. Shinji and Jacob fell to the ground clutching their new wounds. For Shinji it was a long gash cutting alongside the length of his arm. For Jacob it was a painful pierce in his side that managed to go through his armor. His blood flowed freely and openly down his side and onto the ground below him. He knew instantly that he had been wounded mortally, and so forknowing his death he turned and faced his slayer.
真嗣展开翅膀，迅速飞回战场。随着一阵钢铁碰撞的铿锵声，两位神圣的战士再次交锋，随即又分开。他们静静地悬浮在离地面五米的高度，持续了整整一分钟，然后突然向相反方向疾飞而去。几秒钟后，两位天使猛地转向，掠过周围摩天大楼的立面，再次加速冲向对方。剑光闪烁，快得肉眼难辨，两把剑交击，寻找破绽，随即出击。真嗣和雅各布跌落地面，紧捂着新添的伤口。对真嗣而言，是一条沿着手臂长度的深深划痕；对雅各布来说，则是穿透盔甲、刺入侧腹的剧痛。他的血液自由地流淌，顺着身侧滴落到地面。他立刻意识到自己受了致命伤，于是预见到死亡的他转过身，直面杀戮者。

"Rede-...Shinji." “救赎...真嗣。”

The sudden change in his enemys voice caused the teenager to turn and look at the fallen angel. The coal feathers wilted even as Shinji looked at him, and then started falling off rapidly.
敌人声音的突然变化让这位少年转头看向倒下的天使。就在真嗣注视下，那些煤炭般的羽毛开始枯萎，随后迅速脱落。

"You fight well Shinji...You sacrifice yourself for others, but two are still to come...As my brothers before, I now pass away and say this. In a different time...we could have...been...f-frie..n..ds."
"你战斗得很出色，真嗣...你为他人牺牲自己，但还有两个即将到来...就像我的兄弟们之前那样，我现在即将逝去，并说出这句话。在不同的时代...我们本可以...成为...朋...友。"

Jacob collapsed to the ground with a metallic crash and a clatter from his sword. Shinji rushed to the angels side and rolled him over, the fires in his eyes curling back in on themselves and going out. But it was too late for more words...Jacob, the fifthteenth fallen messenger from God, was dead
随着一声金属撞击和剑的叮当声，雅各布倒在了地上。真嗣冲到天使的身边，将他翻转过来，他眼中的火焰蜷缩回自身并熄灭了。但已经来不及再说更多的话了...雅各布，这位来自上帝的第十五位堕落使者，已经死去

"Go in peace brother. God forgive his sins."
"愿你安息，兄弟。愿上帝宽恕他的罪过。"

Sheathing his sword and spreading his wings, Shinji lifted off of the ground and headed up to the place where he saw the curious onlooker. He reached the height of the building but saw no one there.
收剑入鞘，展开双翼，真嗣腾空而起，朝着他看到那位好奇旁观者的地方飞去。他到达了建筑的高度，但那里空无一人。

"Probably left to take shelter..." Shinji's line of thought was interrupted by the sudden shreek of rubber on pavement. Glancing down he saw the blue car Misato drove three years earlier pulled to a stop beside the dead messenger. Misato stepped out of the car with a few security men and moved over to the fallen body. From the same building Shinji stood on ran out a woman with red...hair.
“可能已经离开去避难了……”真嗣的思绪被突如其来的橡胶与路面摩擦声打断。他低头一看，发现三年前由美里驾驶的蓝色汽车停在了那具死去的信使旁边。美里带着几名保安从车里出来，走向倒地的尸体。从真嗣所站的同一栋建筑里，跑出来一个红发女子……

"Asuka...no, no I can't let them see me as this. Not yet, not now."
“明日香……不，不，我不能让他们看到我这样。还不是时候，现在不行。”

He ran to the opposite side of the skyscraper and dropped off into the air below, speeding off to find some solitude in the mountians around Tokyo-3.
他奔向摩天大楼的另一侧，纵身跃入下方的空中，疾驰而去，在东京-3 周围的群山中寻找一片宁静。

Nine days later...

"ASUKAAA! Your dates here and waiting for you!"
“ASUKAAA！你的约会对象已经到了，正在等你！”

"'Kay! I'll be out in a minute." She replied cheerfully, even though tears ran down her face.
“好的！我马上就出来。”她欢快地回答，尽管泪水正顺着她的脸颊滑落。

Asuka quickly wiped away the traces of her sadness and washed her face quickly with water. After making sure she looked normal after applying her makeup she stepped outside the bathroom and entered the livingroom. The young man by the name of Hyuka Rishtimayo stood and found himself unable to speak as he looked over his date, his eyes roaming over her furiously. Asuka gently smiled and struck a slight pose that within her nearly skintight dress showed off even more of her body. By now Hyuka was drooling.
明日香迅速擦去悲伤的痕迹，用水快速洗了把脸。确认化妆后看起来正常，她走出浴室，进入客厅。名叫日向理斯蒂马约的年轻男子站起身来，发现自己看着他的约会对象时说不出话来，目光在她身上游移不定。明日香温柔地微笑着，摆出一个略微的姿势，在她几乎紧贴身体的裙装中，更多地展示了自己的身材。此时，日向已经看得目瞪口呆。

"Pervert...but he almost looks like Shinji..."
变态...但他看起来几乎像真嗣...

"R-ready to go, Asuka?" Hyuka asked shifting nervously on his feet. She nodded affirmative and the pair started towards the door of the miraculously clean apartment when Misatos sing-song voice held them up.
“准备好了吗，明日香？”日向紧张地挪动着脚步问道。她肯定地点了点头，两人正要朝奇迹般干净的公寓门口走去，这时美里那唱歌般的声音让他们停下了脚步。

"Auska. Can I see you for only a minute?"
"明日香，我能见你一分钟吗？"

"Sure Misato."

Leaving Hyuka at the door she stepped back into the kitchen where Misato was drinking a cup of tea. Slowly she stood up and held out her arms to the redheaded pilot, who quickly stepped into them and returned a hug.
将绫波留在门口，她退回厨房，那里美里正在喝着一杯茶。她缓缓站起身，向红发驾驶员伸出双臂，后者迅速迎上前去，回以一个拥抱。

"Now remember, no drinking...and-"
"现在记住，不许喝酒……还有——"

"Be back before one, Misato I know already."
"一点前回来，Misato 我已经知道了。"

"Good...one more thing. Take this." Misato reached into a cabinet nearby and removed a deadly looking pistol. Asuka shook her head and almost took a step back. Realizing what she was thinking Misato tried to controll her laughter.
"好...还有一件事。拿着这个。" Misato 伸手从旁边的柜子里拿出一把看起来致命的手枪。Asuka 摇了摇头，几乎后退了一步。意识到 Asuka 的想法，Misato 试图控制自己的笑声。

"N-no silly...look, there's another angel loose somewhere and we can't find it. You may just run into him and he may have his field down."
"不，不，傻瓜...看，又有一个使徒不知在哪里游荡，我们找不到它。你可能会遇到他，而他可能没有开启他的领域。"

"Misato?"

"Yeah?"

"Thats the stupidist thing I've heard in nearly a year."
"那是我近一年来听过的最蠢的话。"

Misato just laughed at that but still handed Asuka the weapon. She quickly placed it into her purse and left the apartment with her date, heading for the Senior Prom Dance at the school
葛城只是对此笑了笑，但还是把武器递给了明日香。她迅速将其放入手提包，与约会对象一起离开了公寓，前往学校举行的毕业舞会。

Shinji walked slowly in the cool afternoon sunlight, occasional gusts of wind stiring up his unfettered hair and his slashed and tattered robes as the scabbard that held his sword bounced along his back as he walked aimlessly near the outskirts of Tokyo-3. As he walk his hand ran across the bloodstained bandage of his robe that he had applied to himself a few days ago. It hurt still but the pain could be ignored. As he walked he kept his eyes on the glinting skyline of Tokyo-3, still amazed that even after three years it was still as beautiful as he remembered.
真嗣在凉爽的午后阳光下缓缓行走，偶尔一阵风吹起他未束的头发和破烂的袍子，剑鞘随着他的步伐在他背上轻轻跳动，他漫无目的地走在第三新东京市的郊外。行走间，他的手抚过几天前自己包扎的染血绷带，疼痛依旧，但可以忽略。他边走边凝视着闪闪发光的第三新东京市天际线，仍然惊叹，即使过了三年，它依然如记忆中那般美丽。

"But its still not as beautiful as Asuka." Shinji said aloud, dropping his hands to the side and sighing deeply. He stopped walking and remained there long enough for the sun to sink behind the hills and for the stars to show. When he looked up again it was beacuse of the unnerving sensation that he was being watched. He drew out his sword with lightning speed and whirled around slashing it through the air behind him. He met and saw nothing, but the feeling remained with him. Seeing lights off in the distance to the right, Shinji decided that now would be a good time to see what rumors were going around about his fight. Even as he ran though, the feeling stuck to him.
"但仍不及明日香美丽。" 真嗣大声说道，双手垂落，深叹一口气。他止步不前，直至夕阳沉入山后，星辰显现。再次抬头，是因那被人窥视的不安感。他以迅雷不及掩耳之势拔剑转身，在身后空气中猛烈挥砍。然而所见空无一物，那感觉却挥之不去。望见远处右侧有灯光闪烁，真嗣决定此刻正是探听关于自己战斗传闻的好时机。即便奔跑中，那感觉依旧如影随形。

The dance was not going well for Asuka. Twice the boy she was with tried to go further down her side than she wanted, and he also tried to kiss her on the dance floor. Needless to say she was feeling very pissed off and violated when she collapsed into a seat next to her longtime friend Hikari Horaki and her own boyfriend Toji Susahara. Over the years Toji and Asuka finally came to accept the fact that neither would back down or leave the city or die, despite all the wishes they made to that effect. And so, came to a mutual agreement to ignore each other for as much as possible. But today she was feeling testy.
阿苏卡的舞跳得并不顺利。两次与她共舞的男孩试图比她愿意的更深入她的身侧，还在舞池中试图吻她。不用说，她感到非常愤怒和被侵犯，当她瘫坐在她的老朋友光博拉基和她男友图吉·苏萨哈拉旁边的座位上时。多年来，图吉和阿苏卡终于接受了这样一个事实：尽管他们都有过这样的愿望，但谁也不会退缩、离开城市或死去。因此，他们达成了一个共识，尽可能地忽视对方。但今天，她感到烦躁不安。

"Asuka whats wrong?" Hikari asked looking concerned for her friend.
“阿苏卡，怎么了？”光博关切地看着她的朋友问道。

"Was it that attack last week?" Toji asked perceptivly, cutting to the root of her problems. Also over the years Toji had matured greatly, and managed to develop a keen sense of a persons thoughts and moods. Another thing Asuka hated about him being around her when she felt bad.
“是因为上周的袭击吗？”图吉敏锐地问道，直击她问题的核心。同样，多年来图吉已经成熟了许多，并且成功地培养了对人的思想和情绪的敏锐感知。这也是阿苏卡讨厌他在她感到不好时在她身边的原因之一。

"Is it?" He pressed. "是吗？" 他追问道。

"YES! Yes...it is." Asuka shouted over the music at him. Several dancers nearby turned to look at the source of the shout, then turned away again as they saw who had shouted. Hyuka winced when he saw her shout and felt that it would be in his best intrest to leave before she noticed him again. He turned around and kept to the shadows as he slowly made his way over to the double doors leading out of the gym that the dance was being held in. Reaching the doors he blew a sigh of relief and glanced around.
"是的！是的...就是这样。" 明日香在音乐声中对他喊道。附近的几名舞者转头看向喊声的来源，然后又转开视线，因为他们看到了是谁在喊叫。冬树看到她大喊时皱了皱眉，觉得最好在她再次注意到他之前离开。他转身，尽量避开灯光，慢慢向体育馆双开门走去，舞会就在那里举行。到达门口时，他松了一口气，环顾四周。

"Excuse me."

The light musical voice made Hyuka jump a foot into the air and whirl around in a loose defense stance as he faced the speaker. He found his attacker to be nothing more than a young man with light gray hair and red eyes, strange colors yes but when you had classes with Rei Ayanami you became used to such strange colors on a person. He could even see a slight resembalance between the two.
那轻快的音乐般的声音让冬树吓得跳了起来，转身摆出一个松散的防御姿势面对说话者。他发现对方不过是一个有着浅灰色头发和红色眼睛的年轻人，颜色确实奇怪，但当你和绫波丽同班时，你就会习惯人们身上的这些奇怪颜色。他甚至能在这两人之间看到一丝相似之处。

"Y-yes?" Hyuka answered hesitantly, dropping his stance and adjusting the tuxedo he wore. That was another thing, the boy facing him wore no formal suit for the dance.
"是、是的？" 日华迟疑地应道，放下防御姿态，调整了一下身上的燕尾服。还有一点，站在他对面的男孩并没有为舞会穿上正式的西装。

"I was just wondering if this was the school that all of the Evangelion pilots went to?"
"我只是好奇，这是不是所有 EVA 驾驶员都就读的学校？"

"Yes. It is." He said exasperatedly, grinding his teeth as he looked away remebering his embaressment when Asuka had slapped him in the middle of the dance floor.
"是的。就是这里。" 他有些恼火地说，咬紧牙关，目光移开，回想起在舞池中央被明日香扇耳光的尴尬时刻。

"Oh. Thank You." "哦，谢谢你。"

Hyuka turned to respond to the polite comment but found himself flying backwards through the air and the double doors of the gym, a sharp pain eminating from the center of his sternum. He was dead before the first screams could leave the mouths of several dancers. The boy that killed him stepped calmly into the panicked crowd and smiled a dark evil smile. Asuka could only stare in horror as the boy with gray hair paled and became a luminescent white form resembaling a human. She dimly heard Hikari scream as the boy unfolded his pair of ink black wings and pulled out from his body a piece of light that reformed into a flaming sword of blue fire.
风花本想回应那礼貌的评论，却发现自己向后飞去，穿过了体育馆的双层门，胸骨中央传来一阵剧痛。在几位舞者的第一声尖叫还未出口之前，他就已经死了。杀死他的男孩平静地走进惊慌失措的人群，露出了一个阴暗邪恶的微笑。明日香只能惊恐地看着那个灰发男孩脸色苍白，变成了一个类似人类的荧光白色形态。她隐约听到光尖叫的声音，只见那男孩展开了一对墨黑色的翅膀，从体内抽出一束光芒，化作一把燃烧着蓝色火焰的烈焰剑。

"Fear Lillim, for the angel of forms has come. NOW IS THE TIME FOR RECKONING! ALL SHALL BE SERVED BEFORE ME!!"
"恐惧莉莉姆吧，形态之天使已经降临。现在正是清算之时！所有的一切都将在我面前得到裁决！"

"I don't think so." Came a calm, reassuring voice from the shattered doors behind the angel.
"我不这么认为。"一个平静而令人安心的声音从天使身后破碎的门中传来。

"WHAATT?! Who DARES to defy my words?!" The sixteenth angel, Judas screamed as he whipped around to face the door. Standing there with the soft streetlights outlining and defining his form and cloths perfectly, stood Shinji Ikari. Only a few could see his face, but the angel had no trouble making out his opponents features.
"什么？！谁敢违抗我的话?!"第十六位天使，犹大咆哮着转身面对门口。站在那里，柔和的路灯完美地勾勒出他的身形和衣着，正是碇真嗣。只有少数人能看到他的脸，但天使毫不费力地辨认出了对手的特征。

"YOU!"

"Me." Shinji responded, willing for his eyes to let loose their fire. Several people fainted when the eyes of the armored man with the tattered robes eyes became filled with blue-white fire of their own. But Asuka did not. If anything she was fascinated by the fact and somehow felt that she knew the man at the doorway. With curls of fire nipping at his eyebrows, Shinji drew his sword and dropped into a ready stance. The angels sword dissapeared back into its body and in the instant that Shinji was stunned by this change of tactics he was railroaded from behind. Another glowing being with ink black wings like the first angel wrapped his arms firmly around Shinji's arms and locked its hands behind his head. Shinji knew a moment of fear and despair as the other angel rushed forward at a blinding speed to land a punch into his stomach armor. Steel cracked and bent underneath the hard first punch from the angel, and Shinji lost all of the breath inside of his lungs causing his head to spin and his hand to drop his sword. The angel punched twice more into his stomach, and on the third blow: blood came flying up into Shinji's mouth.
"我。" 真嗣回应道，渴望自己的双眼释放出火焰。当那位身披破烂长袍的铠甲男子眼中燃起蓝白火焰时，几人因之昏厥。然而明日香并未如此，她反倒对此现象着迷，甚至莫名感觉自己认识门口的那个人。火焰在真嗣的眉间跳跃，他拔剑出鞘，摆出战斗姿态。天使的剑随即融入其体内，就在真嗣因这突变战术而愣神之际，他被从后方猛烈撞击。另一个拥有如初天使般墨黑羽翼的发光体紧紧束缚住真嗣的双臂，双手扣于他脑后。真嗣瞬间感到恐惧与绝望，另一名天使以迅雷不及掩耳之势冲来，一拳重重击中他的腹部铠甲。钢铁在天使的强力一击下破裂弯曲，真嗣气息全无，头晕目眩，手中剑滑落。天使再击两拳，第三拳落下时，鲜血喷涌至真嗣口中。

"And now Redeemed...you DIE!" The sneering face before Shinji proclaimed as its hand formed into a knife edge as it drew back alongside the ribcage of its wielder. Shinji's head drooped from the pain he was experiancing, but a strange sound brought it flying back up. Asuka had finally regained enough of her senses to draw her pistol and shoot at one of the black winged angels holding onto the unidentified man between them. She was not suprised too much when the bullet was stopped by an AT Field.
"而现在，赎罪者...你该死了！" 眼前那张带着嘲讽的脸对真嗣宣告着，它的手化作刀刃形状，随着持有者的肋骨侧边向后拉扯。真嗣因痛苦而垂下了头，但一个奇怪的声音让他猛地抬起头来。明日香终于恢复了足够的意识，拔出手枪向抓住中间那个不明身份男子的黑色羽翼天使之一开火。子弹被 AT 力场挡下，她对此并不感到太惊讶。

"I knew it wouldn't work. Sorry Misato, this may be my last fight." She thought wildly to herself.
"我知道这没用。对不起，美里，这可能就是我的最后一战了。" 她疯狂地自言自语。

The angel however, was furious that a Lilim would interrupt his glorious victory against the one who had killed so many of his kin.
然而，那位天使却因一个莉莉姆打断了他对那个杀害众多同胞之人的辉煌胜利而勃然大怒。

"FOOLISH MORTAL!" It screamed as the opposite arm flew out and streached to immpossibly long lengths to strike Asuka squarely in the face. She flew back several feet and rolled along the floor, clutching at the painful spot alongside her jaw. Shinji saw the flash of red in the girls hair, and rationallized quickly that only Asuka or Rei would even think about carrying a weapon to the school dance. And that made him angry.
"愚蠢的凡人！" 它尖叫着，另一只手臂猛地伸出，不可思议地伸长，狠狠地击中了明日香的面部。她倒飞出去几英尺，滚落在地，捂着下巴旁疼痛的地方。真嗣瞥见了女孩头发中的那一抹红色，迅速推断出，只有明日香或绫波才会想到在学校舞会上携带武器。这让他感到愤怒。

"You...BAASSSTTTAAAAARRRRRD!"
"你...这个混蛋！"

And with an eruption of blue white fire, Shinji released his wings to their full length of ten feet and grabbed the angel that had struck Asuka. Becasue of his sudden wing release, the second angel was sent flying backwards into the wall behind the trio; the outer wall behind the area where the angel struck started to crack violently when he hit. But the first angel would not get off so luckly. Grabbing the undersides of its arms he flapped his wings forcefully against the air and propelled them heavenward. The angel screamed and thrashed violently as the blue aura of flames that now surrounded Shinji was pressed tight against his skin. Smoke the color of blood curled away from the points of contact and the angel punched Shinji desperatly in its attempt to free itself. Soon its wish was granted, but not in the way it wanted. When the pair had reached the ceiling of the building Shinji deftly released his prisoner and flipped nimbly in the air, catching hold of the two black wings instead. With a cry of agony that shattered several windows along the top of the gym, the two symbols of a fallen angel were parted with their owner and consumed by a burst of flames emintaing from Shinji before they died out. The dessicated angel fell helplessly to the hard floor below him, and landed with a sicking crunch of bone and another cry of pain. Shinji dropped down next to his sword and quickly made his way over to the angel, intent on ending its existance before another could be hurt. He dropped into a run and closed the distance between himself and the angel, and was almost within the absolute kill range of his weapon when his quarrys body intensified into a beam of light that shot out to the impression in the cement wall. The light connected with the unconsious angel laying their and engulfed it totally. When it dimmed enough for Shinji to see, the angel was standing up slowly and flexing its hands.
随着一阵蓝白火焰的爆发，真嗣展开了他那长达十英尺的翅膀，抓住了袭击明日香的使徒。由于他突然展开翅膀，第二使徒被猛地抛向三人后方的墙壁；当使徒撞击到外墙时，撞击点周围的墙面开始剧烈开裂。但第一使徒就没那么幸运了。真嗣抓住其双臂下方，用力拍打翅膀对抗空气，将他们推向高空。使徒尖叫着剧烈挣扎，蓝色火焰光环紧紧压迫着它的皮肤。血色烟雾从接触点升腾，使徒绝望地挥拳试图挣脱。不久，它的愿望得以实现，但并非如它所愿。当两人抵达建筑顶部时，真嗣灵巧地释放了俘虏，并在空中翻转，转而抓住了那对黑色翅膀。 随着一声撕心裂肺的惨叫，震碎了体育馆顶部的几扇窗户，那两个堕天使的象征与其主人分离，被真嗣身上爆发出的火焰吞噬，随后熄灭。干枯的天使无助地坠向坚硬的地板，伴随着骨头碎裂的令人作呕的声响和另一声痛苦的哀嚎。真嗣落在他的剑旁，迅速冲向天使，决心在更多人受伤之前结束它的存在。他疾跑缩短了与天使之间的距离，几乎进入了他武器的绝对击杀范围时，猎物的身体突然强化成一道光束，射向水泥墙上的凹陷处。光线与躺在那里的昏迷天使相连，将其完全吞没。当光线减弱到足以让真嗣看清时，天使正缓缓站起，活动着它的双手。

"Well, well...almost had me there. But I will not die so EASILY!" Both arms lanced up and out towards Shinji, their hands becoming shapeless forms of light that split off into dozens of strands that raced for him.
“哼，哼……差点就栽在你手里了。但我可不会这么轻易死去！”两条手臂向上向外伸向真嗣，双手化作无定形的光芒，分裂成数十条光线，疾速向他袭来。

"SHIIITTTT!"

Shinji flapped furiously in an attempt to evade most of the strands, and used the sword to deflect others that came too close. But one strand was heading for the unmoving form of Asuka nearby.
真嗣拼命地挥动着，试图躲避大部分的触须，并用剑挡开那些逼近的。但有一根触须正朝着附近一动不动的明日香袭去。

"ASUKAAAA!"

With no way to deflect the strand he chose his only other option. Asuka slowly reganed a semblance of a working mind when she heard a sicking crunch closeby to her.
无法挡开那根触须，他选择了唯一的其他选项。明日香在听到附近传来一阵令人作呕的碎裂声时，渐渐恢复了一些思考能力。

Shinji felt pain that was to say unbelivable to experiance. Nothing in his life, not in Eva, not before, not after, had he ever felt anything remotly like this. The stream of the angel had cleanly shot through his armor and entered his lower right ribs. The pain numbed his hands and his legs, which buckled beneath him letting him sink to the floor with a grind of metal. His sword fell once more to the floor from his numbed fingers and landed amongst the small pool of blood that was running from his wounds.
真嗣感受到的痛苦简直难以置信。他一生中，无论是在 EVA 里，还是之前或之后，都从未体验过如此剧烈的痛楚。天使的触须干净利落地穿透了他的装甲，射入了他的右下肋骨。疼痛使他的双手和双腿麻木，支撑不住，让他跪倒在地，金属摩擦声随之响起。他的剑再次从麻木的手指间滑落，掉进了从伤口流出的血泊中。

"I've...I've failed once again..."
"我又...我又失败了..."

"YES! DIE REDEEMED ONE! YOU HAVE FOUGHT FOR NOTHING! ALL OF MANKIND WILL BE JUDGED AND NO ONE CAN STOP THE APOCALYPSE!" The angel cried maniacly as he retracted his sliver of essence from Shinji's broken form. As Shinji fell forward he was caught by a pair of strong arms that wrapped around him. The arms pulled him against the body they were attached to, and then laid him down across the persons lap. Through the haze of pain he could make out a pair of blue eyes and a long length of soft, silky, red hair that gently brushed and tickled his nose. He also felt a drop of liquid on his face and felt that he himself was also crying.
"太好了！去死吧，被救赎者！你白白战斗了！全人类都将受到审判，没有人能阻止末日的到来！"天使疯狂地喊叫着，从真嗣破碎的身体中收回了他的一丝本质。当真嗣向前倒下时，他被一双强壮的手臂接住，这双手臂紧紧地环绕着他。手臂将他拉向与之相连的身体，然后将他平放在那人的腿上。在痛苦的迷雾中，他能看到一双蓝色的眼睛和一束柔软、丝滑、红色的长发，轻轻地拂过并轻触他的鼻子。他还感觉到一滴液体落在他的脸上，意识到自己也在哭泣。

"Asuka..." Shinji reached up with a hand and tried to touch his loves face. He found his strength flagging only halfway their though and wondered if he would never be able to touch her when she suddnely took his hand in hers and pulled up alongside her cheek, letting him carress the smooth and soft flesh gently as she carefully held him close against her body.
"明日香..." 真嗣伸出一只手，试图触摸他爱人的脸庞。他发现自己的力气只够到一半，不禁怀疑自己是否永远无法触碰到她，然而她突然握住他的手，拉到她的脸颊旁，让他轻轻抚摸那光滑柔软的肌肤，同时小心翼翼地将他紧紧抱在怀里。

"Sh-Shinji...I...I lov-" Asuka was gently silenced by his fingers coming across her lips. The angel nearby made gagging gestures as he turned away and headed off to complete his mission of contacting Adam. His forehead came into close contact with the barrel of Asuka's pistol and he could only look at the weilder, Toji Susahara, with confusion and fear evident on his face.
"Sh-Shinji...我...我喜-" 话未说完，Asuka 被 Shinji 的手指轻轻按住了嘴唇。旁边的天使做出作呕的手势，转身离开去执行与 Adam 联络的任务。突然，他的额头紧贴上了 Asuka 的手枪枪口，只能带着困惑和恐惧的眼神望向持枪者——Toji Suzahara。

"Block this!" Toji shouted as he pulled back on the trigger, sending a 9mm slug boring directly into the skull and then out again. The angel collapsed on the floor, his face still registering shock at his sudden end.
"挡住这个！" Toji 大喊着扣动扳机，一颗 9 毫米子弹直接穿透了天使的头颅又飞出。天使倒在地上，脸上还带着对突如其来的终结的震惊。

To be continued...

Phionex of the Fallen notes: Man, this was an interesting fic to write. This is actually the first one that I will have finished and sent out to the community for reviews. I do have several other fics (including some non Eva ones) in varying degrees of completeion written up and I may decide to release those at any time. After this one I will probably put out my big project: Wishfull Thinking. And I must say that the writing style differs slightly from this one so I urge you to look for that and read it as well. All of my fics are inspired by Evangelion: Made by those blessed people who work and own Ganaix. Damn, now how the hell much was it to buy the thing? I also think that Ganaix should sell out a liscence to collaborations of fanfic writers to come up with alternate book storylines (okay what the hell time in the morning was it that I came up with this shit?). Next episode: Asuka and Shinji, Shinji and Shinji's Inner Voice, Toji and Hikari, Kensuke and...REI? As well as the final angel.
堕落凤凰的笔记：天啊，这篇同人创作真是别具一格。这实际上是我完成并提交给社区接受评阅的第一篇作品。我还有几篇其他同人（包括非 EVA 题材）处于不同程度的完稿阶段，随时可能发布。在此之后，我可能会推出我的大作：《一厢情愿》。必须指出，其写作风格与这篇略有不同，因此我恳请大家留意并阅读。我的所有同人作品灵感均源自《新世纪福音战士》：由那些受祝福的、在 Ganaix 工作的创作者们所打造。该死，当初买下这部作品版权究竟花了多少钱？我还认为 Ganaix 应该授权给同人作者们合作，共同构思新的故事线（好吧，我到底是凌晨几点想出这玩意儿的？）。下一章节：明日香与真嗣，真嗣与内心的自我对话，东治与光，健介与……绫波？以及最终使徒。


Shinji felt cold. It was a strange feeling for him because for three years of his life he had felt nothing but warm sensations while he trained himself to return to Earth to finish the fight against the angels.
真嗣感到寒冷。对他来说，这是一种奇怪的感觉，因为在过去三年的生活中，他只感受到温暖的感觉，那时他训练自己返回地球，以完成与使徒的战斗。

A slight whoosh of air.
轻微的空气呼啸声。

The air smelled clean, sterile, devoid of any scents or flavorings to its bland composure at all. A tickling sensation slowly made itself aware in the cavernous recesses of his mind.
空气闻起来干净、无菌，没有任何气味或调味品来为其平淡的构成增添风味。一种微痒的感觉慢慢在他的脑海深处变得清晰起来。

Another whoosh of air, then a low electronic beeping.
又是一阵风声，随后是低沉的电子蜂鸣声。

"Where am I?" Shinji wondered aloud in his mind.
“我在哪里？” 碇真嗣在心中大声自问。

"Here." Came an answer. “在这里。” 一个声音回答道。

"Where is here?" He asked in return, having long become familiar with the aspect of his mind that coversed with him in extreme circumstances.
"这里是哪里？" 他反问道，早已习惯了在极端情况下与自己对话的那部分心智。

"Where would you like it to be?"
"你希望这里是哪里呢？"

"What kind of question is that?..Fine, I want to be at my home, with Asuka and Misato and Pen Pen!" Shinji's voiced echoed in the empty spaces of his neural synapses.
"这是什么问题？...好吧，我希望在家，和明日香、美里还有企鹅佩佩在一起！" 真嗣的声音在他的神经突触间的空旷中回响。

"Then you are there." "然后你就在那里。"

Shinji closed his eyes and slowly he felt the cold surrounding his body seep away. He no longer felt the tickle of air that bothered him or the low beep and near silent humming from indescriminate electronics. What replaced them was warmth and silence. Slowly he opened his eyes.
真嗣闭上眼睛，渐渐地，他感觉到包围身体的寒冷逐渐消退。他不再感受到困扰他的空气轻拂，或是来自不明电子设备的低沉哔哔声和几乎无声的嗡鸣。取而代之的是温暖与宁静。他缓缓睁开眼睛。

In a small room deep underground in the slightly dilapitated pyrimid that was NERV Headquarters sat Gendo Ikari at his massive and impressive desk surrounded by an eaqually massive and impressive room. Etched into the ceiling and illuminated by lighting in the floor sat a representation of the Tree of Life. It was at this etching Ikari was staring at quietly as Kozou Fuyutski entered the room with Rei Ayanami trailing behind him.
在 NERV 总部那座略显破败的地下深处的小房间里，源堂坐在他那巨大而气派的办公桌前，周围是一个同样宏大而气派的房间。天花板上刻着生命之树的图案，由地板上的灯光照亮。源堂正静静地凝视着这个图案，此时，冬月耕造带着绫波丽走进了房间。

"Ikari..."

"He's back. This is...unexpected...."
"他回来了。这真是...出乎意料...."

Rei walked forward with Fuyutski until they stood before that massive and bare desk. Ikari continued to stare at the ceiling, taking no note of either of the two but somehow knowing exactly what they were doing at the same time.
丽和冬月一起向前走，直到他们站在那张巨大而空旷的办公桌前。碇继续凝视着天花板，对两人视而不见，却又仿佛同时清楚地知道他们的一举一动。

"Yes...and I have some other unusual news. It's about Seele."
"是的...我还有些其他不寻常的消息。是关于 Seele 的。"

Ikari slowly lowered his head to look at Fuyutski and then turned his eyes to face Rei as he steepled his hands on his desk. Rei knew then that she was supposed to elaborate on the statement.
碇源堂缓缓低下头，看向冬月，随后将目光转向绫波，双手交叠在桌上。绫波知道，这时她应该详细说明刚才的陈述。

"Two days ago Kensuke Aida sliced his way into heavily encrypted files at an unknown point. He had found a database storage facility for an unregistered corparation that gave a listing of a transport of one Karou Nagisa to a registered NERV collection site." Rei said in her usual soft monotone.
"两天前，相田剑介不知何时侵入了高度加密的文件。他发现了一个未注册公司的数据库存储设施，其中列出了将一位名叫渚薰的少年运送至已注册的 NERV 收集点的记录。" 绫波以她一贯柔和的单调声音说道。

"Karou Nagisa...Fuyutski?"

Fuyutski reached into his hip pocket and pulled out a data disc and insterted it into a small slot near a collection of buttons and diodes near the rear of the massive desk. He pressed a single flashing diode nearby the slot and stepped back as the holoscreen containing Nagisa's data to appear.
"冬月从裤袋中掏出一张数据碟，插入巨大桌子后方一组按钮和二极管附近的小槽中。他按下靠近插槽的一个闪烁的二极管，随即后退，全息屏幕上随即显现出渚薰的资料。

"A new pilot...from Seele..."
"来自 Seele 的新飞行员..."

Shinji opened his eyes and gazed up to a bare and uninviting ceiling. But he knew the ceiling, it was HIS ceiling. Shinji sprang out of his bed and ran out of his room, heading for the living room. As he entered he tripped over a collection of beer cans and stumbled his way over to the sofa. Sitting in the sofa, listening to music coming from a familiar SDAT player sat his one desire of the mortal world to which he had returned: Asuka.
真嗣睁开眼睛，望向一个光秃秃且不友好的天花板。但他认得这个天花板，这是他的天花板。真嗣从床上跳起来，跑出房间，直奔客厅。进门时，他被一堆啤酒罐绊倒，踉跄着走到沙发旁。沙发上坐着一个人，正听着熟悉的 SDAT 播放器传来的音乐，那是他重返尘世最渴望见到的人：明日香。

"...Asuka..."

Suddenly the redhead turned off the music and spun around, her eyes widening when she saw Shinji. At first shock flowed across her face, then anger and then joy. Impossibly quick she lept across the sofa, the SDAT earplugs falling out of her ears as she did so, and onto the very suprized Shinji sending both of them to the ground.
突然，红发女孩关掉音乐，转过身来，当她看到真嗣时，眼睛瞪大了。起初，震惊掠过她的脸庞，随后是愤怒，接着是喜悦。她以难以置信的速度跳过沙发，SDAT 耳塞随着她的动作从耳中掉落，扑向惊讶不已的真嗣，两人一起倒在地上。

"SHINJI! You're here, you're awake, you're ALIVE! MISATO!!" She shouted as she simultaneously hugged and cryed on the boy who held her attention for more than four years of her life. Shinji uneasily accepted the hugs but smiled all the same as Misato and Pen Pen came into the livingroom with beers in hand to find the two of them on the ground.
“真嗣！你在这里，你醒了，你还活着！美里！”她一边喊着，一边紧紧拥抱着这个占据了她四年多生活的男孩，泪水夺眶而出。真嗣虽然有些不自在地接受了拥抱，但脸上依旧挂着微笑，因为美里和企鹅彭彭手里拿着啤酒走进客厅，发现他们俩正坐在地上。

"SHINJI!" Misato cried out as she dropped her beer to the ground and ran over to help pick him up and hug him as well.
“真嗣！”美里喊着，手中的啤酒掉落在地，她跑过去帮忙扶起他，并紧紧拥抱。

"Warrk?"

"This is also unexpected...it could mean a delay in the final project." Gendo closed the holofile and restepled his hands.
“这也很出乎意料……可能意味着最终项目的延迟。”源渡关闭了全息文件，重新交叉双手。

"Seele will also be interested in this Aida, they apparently know he decrypted these files."
"Seele 也会对这个 Aida 感兴趣，他们显然知道他破解了这些文件。"

"There are agents?" Gendo asked his onetime professor cooly.
"有特工吗？" 源渡冷静地问他的昔日教授。

"Two."

Gendo fell silent for a moment as he weighed out situations and balanced them with his own plans and needs. He unfolded his hands and reached for a drawer down near the floor. He opened it and pulled out a black leather sholder holster and slid it across the expanse of desk towords Rei. The metal pistol and gleaming blalance clips let off a cold sheen as they waited on the desk.
源渡沉默了一会儿，权衡各种情况，并将其与自己的计划和需求相平衡。他展开双手，伸手去够地板附近的一个抽屉。打开后，他拿出一个黑色皮革肩挂枪套，将其滑过宽阔的桌面推向绫波。金属手枪和闪亮的平衡夹在桌上等待时，散发出冷冽的光泽。

"Rei will handle the situation."
"零会处理这个情况的。"

"I will attempt to locate these agents at-"
"我将尝试定位这些特工——"

"No...you will 'handle' the situation. Understood."
"不...你将'处理'这个情况。明白了吗？"

Rei blinked, once, and then slowly nodded to the commander once before reaching for the holster and leaving. Once the door had closed Fuyutski turned and glared at his superior.
绫波眨了眨眼，然后缓缓向指挥官点头一次，伸手去拿枪套并离开。门一关上，冬月就转过身来，怒视着他的上级。

"That wasn't wise Ikari. She could be hurt if the others attack at the same time. And killing a kid..."
那不是明智之举，碇。如果其他人同时攻击，她可能会受伤。而且杀一个孩子……

Gendo camly resteepled his hands and stared hard at the sub-commander until he fell silent and still. They remained that way for several minutes before Fuyutski turned and walked out of the office.
碇冷静地将双手重新交叉，目光锐利地盯着副指挥官，直到他沉默并静止。他们就这样僵持了几分钟，随后冬月转身走出了办公室。

It was several hours later and Shinji was feeling, pampered. He had never been treated like this before in his life, and Misato teasing him about the way he squirmed when Asuka suddenly gave him a deep kiss hadn't helped the situation. Soon came dinner, and Misato stood up to go and search for food in the refridgerator, and turned up empty.
几个小时后，真嗣感到前所未有的宠爱。他这辈子从未被如此对待过，而明日香突然给他一个深吻时，他扭捏的样子被美里取笑，更是让情况雪上加霜。不久晚餐时间到了，美里起身去冰箱找食物，却一无所获。

"Oh, don't worry. I can go get us some." Asuka voluntereed.
“哦，别担心。我可以去买点回来。”明日香自告奋勇地说。

"I'll go with you Asuka." Shinji said with a large smile as they stood together.
“我和你一起去，明日香。”真嗣带着大大的笑容，与她并肩站在一起说道。

"OKAY THEN! Yay, just like old times...but Shinji, don't try to do anything with Asuka, okay? I would like to eat sometime this week."
"好吧！耶，就像以前一样...但是真嗣，不要试图对明日香做什么，好吗？我希望这周能吃上饭。"

Both Shinji and Asuka blushed furiously at the comment before shouting loudly at their guardian to be quiet and mind her own affairs and storming out.
听到这话，真嗣和明日香都满脸通红，大声向他们的监护人喊着让她安静，管好自己的事，然后气冲冲地走了出去。

Kensuke Aida spent most of his seventeen years of life either reading extensive fantasy books, or working furiously on his computers. That latter statement was more often than true as of late in his life. Ever since he had confirmed Shinji actually alive and back in Tokyo-3 he had been slicing into every encrypted file he could find on the vast web of information on the net. He had found several interseting tidbits of information, including a recent addend to the Evangelion Pilots, Karou Nagisa. But nothing about Shinji or where he had been for three years of his life.
相田剑介在他十七年的人生中，大部分时间要么沉浸在浩瀚的奇幻书籍中，要么疯狂地操作他的电脑。最近，后者的情况更是频繁。自从他确认真嗣还活着并回到了第三新东京市后，他就开始深入网络的信息海洋，破解他能找到的每一个加密文件。他发现了一些有趣的信息片段，包括最近加入的 EVA 驾驶员，渚薰。但关于真嗣或他过去三年生活的地方，却一无所获。

"Its as if he dissapeared.." Kensuke mused idley as he rocked back and forward in his computer chair, desperatly thinking of somewhere he hadn't already scoured for information about Shinji. He was still like that as three seperate bullets slammed into him from three different angles, one from his left, one from the right, and one from directly behind. All piercing his fragile cranium and then shooting out again. Kensuke slumped down quickly onto his keyboard, the gaps between the keys rapidly filling with his dark red blood and gray-yellow brain matter.
“他仿佛就这样消失了……”健介若有所思地坐在电脑椅上来回摇晃，拼命思索着还有哪里没有搜寻过有关真嗣的信息。就在这时，三颗子弹从三个不同的角度同时击中了他，一颗来自左侧，一颗来自右侧，还有一颗直接从背后射入。它们穿透了他脆弱的头颅后又飞溅而出。健介的身体迅速瘫倒在键盘上，按键间的缝隙很快被深红色的血液和灰黄色的脑组织填满。

Shinji and Asuka returned from the store and found Misato passed out on the sofa, a new pile of Yebisu cans centered around a like-wise inebriated penguin. They both laughed at the sight and went into the kitchen to prepare dinner for the two of them. After Shinji finished putting away the extra food he washed quickly and dished the quick ramen and curry mix onto plates before setting them out on the table. They both picked at their food as they filled the other in on what had been happening during their three year seperation. Finishing the cold food nearly an hour later they both felt weary and yet at the same time invigorated by seeing each other. Tossing a blanket over Misato and moving Pen Pen gently into his refridgerator they both went to their bedrooms and took a moment to hug each other. Shinji decided to be bold and gave Asuka a kiss before he slipped away into the dark recess of his room. Asuka remained outside a moment longer before touching her lips and smiling at the door before heading off on her own. Shinji smiled broadly as he dropped down on his bed and looked up at the ceiling. He fell asleep soon after but tossed and turned all through the night. His dreams disrupted by a slight tickle on his face and his ears filled with a soft hum and beep from somewhere out in the city.
真嗣和明日香从商店回来，发现美里醉倒在沙发上，一堆新的惠比寿啤酒罐围绕着同样醉醺醺的企鹅。两人见状都笑了，随后走进厨房为彼此准备晚餐。真嗣收拾完多余的食物后迅速清洗，将速食拉面和咖喱混合物盛在盘子里，摆放在桌上。他们边吃边聊，互相更新着三年分离期间发生的事情。将近一个小时后，他们吃完了冷食，虽然感到疲惫，但重逢的喜悦让他们精神焕发。他们给美里盖上毯子，轻手轻脚地将企鹅移至冰箱，然后各自回到卧室，拥抱片刻。真嗣鼓起勇气，在进入黑暗的房间前给了明日香一个吻。明日香在门外停留了一会儿，轻触嘴唇，对着门微笑后才离开。真嗣躺在床上，望着天花板，笑容满面。他很快入睡，但整夜辗转反侧。 他的梦境被脸上轻微的痒感打断，耳边充斥着城市某处传来的柔和嗡鸣与哔哔声。

"The mission is complete." Rei camly said as she placed the pistol and holster onto the desk of Gendo Ikari without a sound.
“任务已完成。”绫波丽平静地说道，将手枪和枪套无声地放在了源堂的桌上。

"Good. The Fifth Child is arriving today, I wish for you to meet him. He will arrive by route B at 1345 hours."
“很好。第五适格者今天到达，我希望你去见他。他将在 1345 时通过 B 路线抵达。”

"Yes sir."

Two hours later, the cold and enigmatic Rei waited at the top of an escelator as a gray haired boy of 17 slowly ascended. At the top he smoothly stepped away from the stairs and walked up to the lithe girl.
两小时后，冷峻而神秘的绫波丽在电梯顶部等候，一名 17 岁的灰发少年缓缓上升。到达顶部后，他从容地离开阶梯，走向那位纤细的女孩。

"You are Rei Ayanami, correct?" He asked in a musical tone.
“你是绫波丽，对吧？”他用悦耳的语调问道。

A nod was all he was given in return.
他得到的回应仅是一个点头。

"I sense that we have a lot in common with each other. Much more than either of us suspects I imagine." He said as he offered his arm to her. She pointedly refused his attempt by turning away and walking forward.
"我感觉我们之间有很多共同点。我想，比我们任何一方想象的都要多。" 他说着，向她伸出手臂。她故意拒绝了他的尝试，转身向前走去。

"This way," Her voice floated back to the new pilot. "We need to perform a synchronization test with the Eva for you."
"这边走，" 她的声音飘回到新飞行员那里。"我们需要为你和 Eva 进行同步测试。"

She led the new and engimatic boy through a seeming labyrinth of tunnels and walkways before she arrived at the pilots ready-room.
她带领着这位新来的、神秘的男孩穿过看似迷宫般的隧道和走道，最终到达了驾驶员准备室。

"The plug suit is in there. Do you need assistance in putting it on?" She asked still emotionless. Karou gave her a small and warm smile.
"驾驶服在里面。你需要帮忙穿上吗？" 她依旧面无表情地问道。真嗣给了她一个温和的微笑。

"No I belive I can handle myself." He answered as she opened the door for him.
"不，我相信我自己能行。" 他回答道，而她为他打开了门。

Later, Rei stood impassivly nearby a console manned by the shy and timid Maya Ibuki and the stalwart Ritsuko Akagi as they ran the tests over the new boy. He first attempted to synch with Eva Unit 01, but he was almost immediatly rejected from the unit. Next he tried Unit 00 and recived similar results.
稍后，丽站在一旁，面无表情地看着由害羞胆小的伊吹摩耶和坚毅的赤木律子操作的控制台，他们正在对新来的男孩进行测试。他首先尝试与初号机同步，但几乎立刻就被机体排斥。接着他尝试了零号机，结果也差不多。

"Try again, this time in Unit 02," Ritsuko said tiredly to the soft-spoken boy. He slowly climbed out and moved over to the next Eva in line as Ritsuko turned off the mike and analysed the data from the first two attempts. "Asuka won't be happy with this..."
"再试一次，这次用二号机，" 律子疲惫地对那个说话轻声细语的男孩说道。他缓缓爬出来，移步到下一台 Eva 前，而律子则关闭了麦克风，分析前两次尝试的数据。"明日香对此不会高兴的……"

"Well, why should we need another pilot for anyway? We have two operational Evas and we haven't even used them against the last two angels that attacked."
"话说回来，我们为什么还需要另一个驾驶员呢？我们已经有两台可操作的 Eva，而且对最近两次袭击的天使我们甚至都没动用它们。"

"Don't question the orders from above Maya...that's rule number one of the military life." Ritsuko sighed.
"不要质疑上面的命令，真夜……这是军人生涯的第一条规则。" 律子叹了口气。

Karou climbed into the plug and activated it. The sudden scroll of data that flowed into the screens caused Ritsuko and Maya to gasp a bit and lean forward. To Rei's bemusement they began to talk in hushed tone and rapidly typed in commands or requests of the Magi. Soon they shut down the test protocals and told Karou he could leave for his quarters. They continued to talk rapidly as Rei left to meet up with Nagisa and escort him to his room.
卡洛爬进插头并激活了它。屏幕上突然涌入的数据流让律子和玛雅不禁倒吸一口凉气，身体前倾。令绫波感到困惑的是，她们开始低声交谈，并迅速输入命令或向 MAGI 提出请求。不久，她们关闭了测试协议，告诉卡洛可以回自己的房间了。当绫波离开去与渚会合并护送他回房间时，她们仍在快速交谈。

Shinji rolled over on his bed and winced at the feeling of cold sheets that assulted his senses. Slowly he opened his eyes and blinked. In his ears he heard a beeping and hissing sound that intermittantly sounded out quietly but loudly enough for him to hear. He sat up and rubbed his sleep ridden eyes in an attempt to regain his senses and when he finally lowered his hands he screamed and scrambled backwards on his hands and feet. He sat in a black void, strangly similar to the pocket space he had trained in before returning to Earth, and before him stood a small...Shinji, staring at the last vestages of bedsheets slowly melting into the floor and fading out of existance. Then the small Shinji looked up at the cowering one and smiled. That smile made Shinji feel as though his soul was being frozen by liquid nitrogen as it was ripped from his body.
真嗣在床上翻了个身，冷冰冰的床单刺激着他的感官，让他不禁皱眉。他缓缓睁开眼睛，眨了眨。耳边传来断断续续的哔哔声和嘶嘶声，虽不响亮，却足以让他听见。他坐起身，揉了揉睡意朦胧的双眼，试图恢复清醒。当他终于放下双手时，他尖叫一声，手脚并用向后退缩。他坐在一片漆黑的虚空中，与之前在返回地球前训练的口袋空间惊人地相似。在他面前，站着一个矮小的...真嗣，正盯着最后几缕床单缓缓融入地板，逐渐消失。然后，小真嗣抬头看向那个蜷缩着的自己，露出了微笑。那个微笑让真嗣感觉自己的灵魂仿佛被液氮冻结，正被从身体中撕扯出来。

"Still unaccepting the truth...still running away. You fear pain?" The apparition asked slowly and coldly for Shinji.
“仍然无法接受真相...还在逃避。你害怕痛苦吗？”幻影缓缓而冷冷地向真嗣问道。

"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU?" He shouted as he stood and backed away a few more steps.
“你到底是什么鬼东西？”他大喊着站起身，又向后退了几步。

"Don't you know yet? Haven't you recived a message telling your simple mind what and who I am?"
"难道你还不知道吗？你那简单的头脑还没有收到关于我是谁、我是什么的消息吗？"

"STOP SPEAKING IN RIDDLES! ANSWER ME! WHERE DID MY ROOM GO? WHERE DID MISATO GO? WHERE DID ASUKA GO!!!!!"
"别再打哑谜了！回答我！我的房间去哪儿了？美里去哪儿了？明日香去哪儿了！！！"

The small apparation of Shinji smiled even wider and pointed to the left. Shinji turned and gasped at the sight he saw.
小小的幻影真嗣笑得更开了，他指向左边。真嗣转身，看到眼前的景象，不禁倒吸一口凉气。

Asuka sat in a chair and gazed sadly at the unmoving form of the love of her life. Shinji Ikari slept soundly in the emergancy box that was barely keeping him in the realm of the living. The tanks of purified oxygen hissed occasionally to keep the box filled with fresh air and the moniters hooked up to the various plugs and outlets beeped intermitantly as they continued to moniter the boys fragile condition. Hikari sat nearby Asuka, sleeping soundly in a plush chair as her friend waited for something to happen. Suddenly both girls were startled out of their respective reveries as the automatic door slid open and a red-eyed Toji Susahara stepped in.
明日香坐在椅子上，悲伤地凝视着她生命中的挚爱，一动不动。碇真嗣在紧急救生舱中安然沉睡，这个救生舱勉强维持着他的生命。净化氧气罐不时发出嘶嘶声，以保持舱内空气新鲜，连接在各种插头和接口上的监视器间歇性地发出哔哔声，持续监测着男孩脆弱的状况。光坐在明日香附近，在一张柔软的椅子上熟睡，她的朋友则在等待着事情的发生。突然，自动门滑动打开，红着眼的铃原东治走了进来，两个女孩都被惊醒了。

"Toji what's wrong?" Hikari asked slightly unsteadily as she sat up and blinked her eyes awake.
“东治，怎么了？”光有些不稳地坐起来，眨着眼睛问道。

"...Its....Kensuke...h-he's..." Toji sobbed quietly as he lowered his head and collapsed into a nearby chair. Both females in the room took a brief glance at each other before Hikari stood and went over to his side. She comforted him as much as she could while he stumbled over his words.
“……是……是洞木……他……”东治低声抽泣着，低下头，瘫坐在旁边的椅子上。房间里的两位女性短暂地对视了一眼，然后光站起来走到他身边。她尽可能地安慰他，而他则结结巴巴地吐露着话语。

"I k-knew something like h-his...harebrained activities w-would result in t- his..." He now openly cried into his palms.
"我知道像他这种...鲁莽的行为...迟早会...” 他现在毫不掩饰地双手掩面哭泣起来。

"Toji...something has happened to Kensuke?" Hikari gently probed.
"东治...真嗣出了什么事吗？" 明日香轻声探问。

"...HE'S DEAD! H-He was shot three times in the head....dammit all..." Toji tore his hands away from his face and punched the aluminum folding chair nearby. His right hook left a sizable imprint in the seat and caused him to cry even more. Hikari gave Asuka a sympathetic glance before gently helping Toji to his feet and leading him out. Asuka shed a single tear before she regained controll of herself and turned back to Shinji, still sleeping in his coffin-like state.
"...他死了！他被爆头三次...该死..." 东治猛地从脸上扯开双手，一拳砸向旁边的铝制折叠椅。他的右勾拳在椅面上留下了一个明显的凹痕，这让他哭得更厉害了。明日香向明日香投去同情的目光，然后温柔地扶起东治，带他离开。明日香流下一滴泪，随即控制住自己的情绪，转头看向仍在棺材般状态中沉睡的真嗣。

"Shinji, please come back to me...we all need you."
"真嗣，请回到我身边...我们都需要你。"

Back in the black void Shinji slumped soundlessly to his knees as he witnessed the scene play before him.
在一片漆黑中，真嗣无声地跪倒在地，目睹着眼前的一幕上演。

"No...no, this...this isn't true....this can't be HAPPENING!" He shouted, closing his eyes and clenching his hands in anger.
"不...不，这...这不是真的....这不可能发生！" 他大声喊道，闭上眼睛，愤怒地握紧拳头。

"But it is. So what are you going to do about it?" Came the mocking tones of the smaller apparition.
"但事实就是如此。那你打算怎么办？" 传来的是那个较小幽灵嘲讽的语调。

"...kill you...I'm gonna KILL YOU!" Shinji shouted as he released his wings from underneath his skin, the bones and matter easily forming and propelling him forward to the smiling phantom. He wrapped his fingers around the little boys throat and squeased hard. A satisfying crunch announced the snapping of the spinal cord and the little boy slouched bonelessly in Shinji's grasp. Then it dissapeared.
"...杀了你...我要杀了你！" 真嗣大喊着，从皮肤下释放出翅膀，骨骼和组织迅速形成并推动他向前冲向那个微笑的幻影。他用手指紧紧掐住小男孩的喉咙，用力挤压。一声令人满意的碎裂声宣告了脊椎的断裂，小男孩在真嗣的掌握中无力地瘫软下来，随后便消失了。

"Do you really? Can you even?" Came the same cold voice from behind Shinji. Slow and steady footsteps echoed across the inky darkness and a new Shinji, this one nearly 15 stepped around to face the elder. "Or do you just want to languish in the subconsious of your mind while others wait for your return?"
"你真的能吗？你甚至能做到吗？" 那个冷酷的声音再次从真嗣身后传来。缓慢而稳定的脚步声在漆黑的黑暗中回响，一个新的真嗣，这个几乎 15 岁的他，绕过来面对年长的自己。"还是说，你只想在你的潜意识中徘徊，而其他人则在等待你的归来？"

"Then tell me how I can return."
"那么告诉我，我该如何回去。"

"But you already know how..." The apparition smiled once more before he faded from view, taking the images of Shinji's hospital room with him.
"但你已经知道方法了……"幽灵再次微笑，随后逐渐消失在视野中，连同真嗣病房中的景象一同消散。

Karou Nagisa, dressed in what many described as typical Shinji-wear: a button up shirt and pressed slacks; stood before the motionless Evangelion Unit 02. He stared at it for what seemed an eternity, then he smiled and turned for the door.
身穿许多人形容为典型的真嗣装扮——纽扣衬衫和熨烫平整的西裤的七濑薰，站在静止不动的 EVA 初号机前。他凝视着它，仿佛过了永恒那么久，然后他微笑着转身向门口走去。

"These Lillim need their false Adams to fight for their survival. But I will not be demeaned and soiled by using such a disgusting and unholy piece of Lillim technology."
"这些莉莉姆需要她们虚假的亚当来为生存而战。但我绝不会自贬身价，被这种令人作呕且不洁的莉莉姆技术玷污。"

Karou continued to quietly talk to himself as he walked down the corridors and towords the hospital. Heading to destroy the greatist threat to his mission as soon as possible. To destroy Shinji Ikari.
卡鲁继续默默地自言自语，沿着走廊走向医院。他正前往尽快摧毁对他任务最大的威胁——摧毁碇真嗣。

Shinji sat in the void for a long time, contemplating what he should do to be released from this hellish menangerie that he was trapped in. Thats when he heard more footsteps echoing through the darkness. He slowly raised his head and let his shoulders slump in preperation for another verbal bashing from another him. He was suprised when Kensuke Aida came into the light of his vision.
真嗣在虚空中坐了很久，思考着如何才能从这个地狱般的牢笼中解脱出来。就在这时，他听到了更多脚步声在黑暗中回响。他缓缓抬起头，肩膀放松，准备迎接另一个自己的言语攻击。然而，当他看到出现在视线中的竟是相田剑介时，他感到非常惊讶。

"S-Shinji?"

"Kensuke...are you...real? Or am I just imagining things again."
"Kensuke...你...是真的吗？还是我又在胡思乱想了。

"Well, I could ask the same about you...where are we?" Kensuke asked, pushing his glasses up along the brige of his nose. Shinji watched this and decided to test him out. He quickly stood and moved over to Kensuke, who drew back slightly at his approach. Of course, having a friend with ten foot wings sticking out of his back would scare anyone, some more than others. Kensuke closed his eyes as he noticed Shinji draw back his hand, and then snapped them wide open when he felt a finger poke him in the stomach.
"嗯，我也可以问你同样的问题...我们在哪儿？" Kensuke 问道，推了推鼻梁上的眼镜。Shinji 看着这一幕，决定试探他一下。他迅速站起来，向 Kensuke 走去，后者在他靠近时略微后退。当然，有一个背后长着十英尺翅膀的朋友，任谁都会感到害怕，有些人比其他人更甚。Kensuke 注意到 Shinji 收回手时闭上了眼睛，然后当他感觉到一根手指戳到他的肚子时，猛地睁大了眼睛。

"Getting a little flabby there eh?" Shinji remarked half-teasingly as he withdrew the probing digit.
"有点发福了啊，嗯？" Shinji 半开玩笑地说着，收回了探查的手指。

"You...you poked me? But I thought..."
"你...你戳了我？但我以为..."

"That you were dead...I think you are...and now I can find my way out of here. I think..." Shinji started to glance around at the darkness and noticed it starting to fade to a pallid gray color.
"我以为你死了...我想你是...现在我应该能找到出去的路了。我想..." 碇真嗣开始环顾四周的黑暗，注意到它开始褪成一种苍白的灰色。

"Where is here?" Kensuke asked, gulping as Shinji turned his head back to look at him.
"这里是哪里？" 洞木光问道，咽了口口水，而碇真嗣则转过头来看着他。

"Purgatory. You're in Purgatory Kensuke."
"炼狱。你身处炼狱，健介。"

"That's a bad thing. I guess now I have to make a choice don't I?" Kensuke said aloud as he tried to remember anything useful written by Dante.
"看来这不是什么好事。我想我现在必须做出选择了，对吧？" 健介自言自语，试图回忆但丁所写的任何有用内容。

"Yes, you do. And now I have to go. I hope you can make it out of here Kensuke, I wish you the best of luck." Shinji opened his wings and propelled himself up, leaving Kensuke behind in the gray null.
"是的，你必须做出选择。而现在我得走了。希望你能从这里逃出去，健介，祝你好运。" 真嗣展开翅膀，向上飞去，留下健介独自在灰色的虚无中。

"I hope to see you again my friend. Take care and good luck." Kensuke called to the fading Shinji. He gave a short sigh and then sat down and closed his eyes, trying to decide whether it would be worth it to fall into his temptations or struggle through an eternity of torment to make it to heaven.
"希望再次见到你，我的朋友。保重，祝你好运。" Kensuke 对着渐渐消失的 Shinji 喊道。他轻叹一声，坐下来闭上眼睛，试图决定是否值得屈服于诱惑，还是挣扎着度过永恒的折磨，以期到达天堂。

Shinji shot past the layers of Purgatory and rose further up until he reached a wall of scillincating colors. Spreading his arms wide he floated to the wall and then gently propelled himself up, entering the colors. Pain shot through him as he felt his soul being ripped away and purified, and then a sense of peace and well being as it was gently reabsorbed into his body. As his eyes cleared themselves of the colored spots swimming before his irises he found himself standing on a pathway of gold blocks. Standing nearby was Abraham, his wings tucked in and his arms crossed.
Shinji 穿过一层层炼狱，继续上升，直到抵达一道闪烁着绚丽色彩的墙壁。他张开双臂，漂浮向墙壁，然后轻轻推动自己向上，进入色彩之中。一阵剧痛袭来，他感到自己的灵魂被撕裂并净化，随后是一种平静和安康的感觉，灵魂被温柔地重新吸收回体内。当他的眼睛清除掉眼前游动的彩色斑点时，他发现自己站在一条由金块铺成的道路上。不远处，Abraham 站在那里，翅膀收拢，双臂交叉。

"Well, certianly took you long enough."
"嗯，你确实花了很长时间。"

Karou walked camly past the sobbing Toji and Hikari and continued on until he reached the door marked with the kanji for: Ikari, Shinji.
卡鲁缓缓走过哭泣的东治和光，继续前行，直到他来到一扇标有‘碇，真嗣’字样的门前。

"Hun, all to easy." He said camly as the door swung open and he stepped through. He noticed Asuka start standing at his arrival and knew she would interfere with his plans. So he delt with her in the most expediant way possible. Brow furrowed, eyes blazing with an intense fury, he summoned that which all Lillim were gifted with but ignored. He summoned a powerful AT Field to form into a wave of power and slam Asuka into the wall behind her. Asuka stared dumbly as she noticed a wave of small dust particles start moving for her near Pilot Nagisa's feet. When the chairs and equiptment between them started to move as well she immediatly put her arms infront of her chest and lowered her head behind them in an effort to shield her body from the blow which she felt shure would come. It did, and she was bodily thrown into the wall, her left shoulder popping out of its joint as she hit. Asuka cried out loudly in pain.
“哼，太容易了。”他平静地说着，门随之打开，他迈步进入。他注意到明日香因他的到来而站起身，知道她会干扰他的计划。于是他用最迅速的方式处理了她。眉头紧锁，眼中燃烧着炽烈的怒火，他召唤出了所有莉莉姆天生拥有却常被忽视的力量。他召唤出一个强大的 AT 力场，形成一股能量波，将明日香猛击到她身后的墙上。明日香目瞪口呆地看着，注意到靠近驾驶员渚薰脚边的小尘埃开始向她移动。当他们之间的椅子和设备也开始移动时，她立刻将手臂交叉在胸前，低头躲在手臂后面，试图保护自己免受她确信会来的打击。打击确实来了，她整个人被抛向墙壁，左肩关节因撞击而脱臼，痛苦地大声尖叫。

"What do you mean by that?" Shinji leaned forward and stared at Abraham nearly nosetip to nosetip.
“你这话什么意思？”真嗣身体前倾，紧盯着亚伯拉罕，几乎鼻尖对鼻尖。

"Nothing...Look I-, oh...ahh...." Abraham clenched his eyes shut and grabbed the sides of his head as white pain flashed through his delicate synapses. "Shinji, you need to hurry. Get back to your body quickly! GO!"
"没什么...看我-,哦...啊..." 亚伯拉罕紧闭双眼，双手抓住头部两侧，剧烈的疼痛在他的敏感神经元中闪过。"真嗣，你得快点。赶紧回到你的身体里去！快走！"

Shinji stood staring for a moment longer and then found himself being pushed by Abraham and told again to leave. He turned away and ran.
真嗣又站了一会儿，然后被亚伯拉罕推了一把，再次被告知离开。他转身跑开了。

Karou looked around at his handywork, admiring the way the Lillim could resist so much pain and still remain fighting. Several others besides Asuka were now pinned to the wall, and all of them still held a defiant look about their faces.
卡鲁环顾四周，欣赏着自己的杰作，惊叹于莉莉姆们能承受如此多的痛苦却依然坚持战斗。除了明日香之外，还有几个人现在也被钉在墙上，他们脸上都带着一种不屈的表情。

"You foolish creations. You do not understand my works, my missions, my holy quests. You are to be judged, so we must judge you. But first...to buisness."
"你们这些愚蠢的造物。你们不懂我的作品，我的使命，我的神圣征途。你们将受到审判，所以我们必须审判你们。但首先...谈正事。"

With a wave of his hand and a direction of an AT Field the box covering Shinji Ikari's body was uncovered and the top thrown easily to the side. Shinji still slept, not moving a centimeter as he was lifted up out of the box and stood straight in the air.
他挥了挥手，用 AT 场指向覆盖着碇真嗣身体的箱子，箱子被轻易揭开，顶盖被轻松抛到一边。真嗣仍在沉睡，身体一动不动地被从箱子中抬起，直立在空中。

"So innocent, yet so repuslive. As well as weak." He commented, cocking his head slightly as he examined the boy.
"如此纯真，却又如此令人厌恶。还有，如此脆弱。" 他评论道，微微侧头审视着这个男孩。

"H-he..is not....weak" Asuka managed to say from her corner of the wall. Tabris, the final angel of judgment simply smiled at her.
"他...他...并不...弱小" 明日香勉强从墙角挤出这句话。作为审判的最终使徒，塔布里斯只是对她微笑。

"You cannot even begin to comprehend what true power is Lillim. You are all simply trash...trash that lives hedonistic lives of unholy filth in denial of God! You all deserve to die slowly in the pits of Hell. It is a pity that God looks on you with such understanding, a pity that you even had a chance to enter the sacred halls of heaven." Tabris said before he increased the AT Field holding her down in place. Another cry of pain came from her lips as she grimaced and bit her lip.
"你根本无法理解什么是真正的力量，莉莉姆。你们不过是垃圾...一群沉溺于不洁享乐、否认上帝的垃圾！你们都该在地狱的深渊中慢慢死去。可惜上帝对你们如此宽容，可惜你们还有机会踏入神圣的天堂之门。" 塔布里斯说完，便加强了压制她的 AT 力场。她痛苦地皱眉咬唇，又是一声惨叫。

"Always picking on the weak, you angels are always like that."
"总是欺负弱小，你们这些天使总是这样。"

"WHAT?!" Tabris snapped his head around to Shinji's floating body, only to be rammed by a strong AT Field and sent flying through the door. As he left all of the myriad persons pressed painfully into the walls slumped to the floor. Asuka managed to stay standing long enough to see Shinji open his eyes, now filled with flames of blue-white that boiled out of the corners, gently ease himself down to the floor and walk out the door.
"什么?!" 塔布里斯猛地转头看向悬浮的真嗣，却被一股强大的 AT 力场撞击，整个人飞出门外。随着他的离去，被痛苦地压在墙上的众人纷纷瘫倒在地。明日香勉强站稳，目睹真嗣睁开双眼，眼角涌出蓝白色的火焰，他缓缓降落到地面，然后走出了门。

In the command center of NERV, the gathered crew and techs gasped collectivly as they saw Shinji walk camly out of the infirmiry and over to a cabinet that held his clothes, sword, and battered armor. Misato blushed slightly as she saw him stride out unclothed as he did but quickly banished any thoughts she had and turned towords Ritsuko.
在 NERV 的指挥中心，聚集的工作人员和技术人员集体倒吸一口凉气，他们看到真嗣平静地从医务室走出，走向存放他衣物、剑和破损盔甲的柜子。看到他赤身裸体地走出来，美里不禁脸红，但很快驱散了心中的杂念，转向了律子。

"Whats happening?"

"Shinji was determined to be part angel a few days ago Misato. He simply generated an AT Field to give the Seventeenth a push out the door."
"几天前就确定真嗣有天使成分了，美里。他只是生成了一个 AT 力场，把第十七使徒推出了门。"

"HE WHAT?!"

"Alert Rei Major. Tell her to head for Terminal Dogma to retrieve the lance."
"紧急通知绫波少校。让她前往最终教条区取回长枪。"

"Alerting now ma'am. Apparently she was waiting in her Eva." Maya said with an uncertian voice.
"正在通知，女士。看来她已经在她的 Eva 里待命了。" 玛雅用一种不确定的语气说道。

"Rei? Did you somehow learn of this before we did?" Misato thought rapidly before leaning forward over Huuga's shoulder. "Prepare the explosive devices in Terminal Dogma."
"绫波？你难道比我们还早知道这件事？" 美里迅速思考后，俯身靠在虎贺的肩上。"在最终教条区准备爆炸装置。"

"Yes ma'am. Ma'am? Its nice knowing I died serving with you." Huuga whispered softly to her, her eyes widened slightly and then narrowed down.
"是的，女士。女士？很高兴知道我是与你并肩作战而死的。"胡加轻声对她说道，她的眼睛微微睁大，随后又眯了起来。

"Same here Huuga. Same here..." Misato continued to lean close by him as she watched both Karou and Shinji start running, Shinji with his sword in hand and still unclothed, out of the hospital and for an Eva shaft. On another screen Unit 00 was dropped down the last hundred meters to land in the bizzare wasteland surrounding Terminal Dogma. The Eva took a moment to straighten itself before it moved slowly for the doors to Heavens Gate, to Adam.
"我也是，胡加。我也是..." 美里继续靠近他，同时看着真嗣和卡洛开始奔跑，真嗣手持剑，仍然赤裸着，冲出医院，向一个 Eva 发射井奔去。在另一个屏幕上，零号机被投放到距离终端教条周围怪异荒地最后百米的位置。Eva 停顿了一下，调整姿态后，缓缓向天堂之门，向亚当走去。

Shinji reached the open entrance to a steep and long Evangelion shaft and never hesitated to leap into the abyss. The last foe was only ten meteres below him and heading for his goal. Shinji narrowed his blazing eyes in concentration, he was determined to not let that happen. Letting his wings reveal themselves and unfold he quickly slowed his descent enough to come even with the last angel. And was shocked to find him floating down without any visable wings himself.
真嗣到达了一个陡峭且深长的 Eva 发射井的开放入口，毫不犹豫地跳入了深渊。最后一个敌人就在他下方十米处，正朝着目标前进。真嗣凝视着炽热的双眼，集中精神，决心不让这种情况发生。他展开翅膀，减缓了下降速度，很快就与最后一个天使并肩。令他震惊的是，他发现对方也在漂浮下降，却没有明显的翅膀。

"So Shinji Ikari...we meet at last." The angel said in a pleasnt tone, as if they weren't plummeting down at a rate fast enough to kill an ordinary man. As if Shinji was fully clothed and unarmed. Shinji wasted no words and sped across the short gap between them to swing his sword down in a blurred diagonal arc that should have cleaved the angel from shoulder to hip. The sword was stopped cold by an AT Field close by the neck of the angel, the ring of steel quite loud in the cavernous shaft. Shinji's expression curled up to one of disgust and revulsion as he drew back and swung forward again, this time expanding his own AT Field at the same time. His gray haired, red- eyed advisary easily ducked under the blade.
"那么，碇真嗣……我们终于见面了。" 天使以一种愉悦的语气说道，仿佛他们并非以足以杀死普通人的速度急速下坠。仿佛真嗣衣着整齐、手无寸铁。真嗣没有浪费任何言语，迅速穿越他们之间短暂的空间，挥剑以模糊的斜线轨迹斩下，本应将天使从肩膀到臀部一分为二。然而，剑被天使颈边的一道 AT 力场冷冷挡住，钢铁碰撞的回声在空旷的竖井中格外响亮。真嗣的表情扭曲成厌恶与憎恶，他收回剑再次挥出，这次同时扩展了自己的 AT 力场。他那灰发红眼的对手轻松地低头躲过了剑锋。

"Is this all the mighty Ikari can do to me? I might have had better luck challenging Asuka or Toji to such a fight." Tabris taunted Shinji as he pulled back from the immobile angel.
"难道这就是伟大的碇真嗣能对我做的全部吗？我或许挑战明日香或东治这样的对手还更有胜算。" 塔布里斯嘲讽着真嗣，同时从静止不动的天使身边撤回。

"You have the courage to try and slay me as I sleep, and to kill my friends with your vaunted AT Field but not to face me!?"
"你有勇气趁我沉睡时试图杀我，用你那自负的 AT 力场杀害我的朋友，却不敢面对我！？"

"Oh...your friends? Yes well, Lillim will always be weaker than me and my breathern. And to you, you met that one poor boy didn't you...what was his name? Aida?" A sudden flash of silver and a clang of steel gave Tabris his answer. "Do you know who killed him?"
"哦...你的朋友？是的，莉莉姆永远比不上我和我的同胞。至于你，你遇到了那个可怜的男孩，对吧...他叫什么名字来着？艾达？" 一道银光闪过，紧接着是钢铁碰撞的声音，塔布里斯得到了答案。"你知道是谁杀了他吗？"

"Shut up! For all I know it was-YOU!" Shinji grunted as he swung again at the angel, and again failing. "Why can't I get through?" He wondered.
"闭嘴！据我所知，就是你！" 真嗣咆哮着再次向天使挥剑，却又一次失败。"为什么我打不中？" 他疑惑道。

"No, no I don't have time to kill little creatures. But I know who does...your father, Gendo Ikari."
"不，不，我没空杀小生物。但我知道是谁干的...你的父亲，源堂。

Shinji brought his sword close by his side and stared open mouthed at the angel, both of them continuing to descend.
真嗣将剑紧贴身侧，目瞪口呆地盯着使徒，两者继续一同下落。

"Oh, yes...quite the loving father there. Ordered the death of your friend Aida...cold blooded murder too, and the best part....second best part is, he didn't even need to order the execution! Two others from Seele, Gendo's masters, had already ordered it! But he just didn't contribute, he actually twisted the knife! Although you would never learn who he sent to do the dirty work...but I did learn."
哦，没错……真是个慈爱的父亲。下令处死了你的朋友绫波……还是冷血谋杀，最精彩的部分……第二精彩的部分是，他甚至不需要亲自下令执行！SEELE 的另外两人，碇源堂的主子们，已经下达了命令！但他不仅没有阻止，反而还火上浇油！虽然你永远不会知道是谁执行了这肮脏的勾当……但我却查到了。

"SHUT UP!!" Shinji shouted loudly, glancing down to see the end of the shaft close at hand.
“闭嘴！！”真嗣大声吼道，低头一看，发现井底已近在咫尺。

"He sent one of your 'other' friends to do it...he sent one of your first and one of your best friends to kill him," Tabris leaned in closer and smiled evily at Shinji. "He sent Rei."
"他派了你'另一位'朋友去执行这个任务...他派了你最早也是最好的朋友之一去杀他," 塔布里斯凑近身来，对着真嗣邪恶地笑了笑。"他派了绫波。"

"..No, no, she would-" "...不，不，她不会——"

"She did. Why not ask her yourself?" Tabris pointed down to the growing Evangelion nearing the exit shaft, carrining a giant, two-pronged spear in her left hand. "Why serve these infidels when you already are something so much more? Join with me Shinji, and clense this world of the evil it has spawned. Clense it of your father's evil!"
"她确实这么做了。为什么不亲自问问她呢？" 塔布里斯指向正逐渐接近出口井的日益增大的福音战士，她左手握着一把巨大的双叉矛。"为何要侍奉这些异教徒，而你本已是更为崇高的存在？与我联手吧，真嗣，净化这个孕育了邪恶的世界。清除你父亲带来的邪恶！"

At those last words, Shinji: who had been clenching one of his hands to his face while the other gripped tightly to his sword, opened his eyes and raised the sword until the bladetip was leveled horizontally at the angel's face.
听到最后那句话，真嗣：他一只手紧握着脸，另一只手紧紧抓着剑，睁开眼睛，将剑举起，直到剑尖水平对准了使徒的脸。

"If I'm so great and powerful, why should I have to join with you to kill my father?"
如果我如此伟大和强大，为什么我还要和你联手去杀我的父亲？

Tabris closed his mouth as they floated down the last few meters and landed gently on the ground. Eva Unit 00 edged in closer to the two but stopped nearly fifty meters away.
塔布里斯闭上嘴，随着他们缓缓下降最后几米，轻轻地落在地上。零号机向两者靠近，但停在约五十米外。

"Too bad. Now I must finish my job. If you will excuse me for a moment..." Tabris closed his eyes and let his own wings sprout from his back. The wings, unlike the other three angels Shinji had already encountered, were not coal black. These instead were a downy light gray, and far smaller than even his own. As he stood pondering these changes Tabris smiled and turned to face the Eva.
"太遗憾了。现在我必须完成我的任务。如果你能稍等片刻的话……" 塔布里斯闭上眼睛，让他的翅膀从背后伸展出来。这些翅膀与真嗣之前遇到的三位天使不同，并非漆黑一片。它们是柔软的浅灰色，甚至比真嗣自己的还要小。当真嗣站在那里思考这些变化时，塔布里斯微笑着转向了 EVA。

"Filth, Unholy garbage. DIIIIIEEEEEEE!!"

With a sudden burst of speed that kicked up flurries of what appeared to be snow the angel sped forward fast enough to leave a trail of afterimages behind him for a long second or two, his small wings somehow propelling him faster than Shinji could even comprehend...straight for Rei.
随着一阵突如其来的加速，激起了看似雪花的飞舞，天使以快到能在身后留下一连串残影的速度冲向前方，持续了一两秒。他那对小翅膀不知怎的竟能推动他以真嗣难以理解的速度直奔向绫波。

"REI! EVASIVE-" Was all that came in over the comm lines from Misato before Rei felt an impact on her left arm. Glancing down with her optical lense she saw a winged Karou with his arm up to the elbow shoved deep into the armor casing. Klaxons blared around her as diagnostic screens reported contamination spreading through the arm and heading for the central brain cavity. Suddenly the arm flexed and the Lance of Longinus reformed into a massive sword of titanic proportinons. The contamination was now spreading to her chest and legs and head as shooting pain raced through the nerual feeds and into her body. Her back arced as the pain narrowed her vision and spasmed her body against the hard surfaces of the entry plug seat. Over the lines she dimly heard Misato shouting something about ejecting from the Eva, and for a moment she considered that. Then the Eva started walking forward, towords Shinji with the lance-sword leading.
"REI! 规避——" 这是通讯线路中传来的全部信息，紧接着绫波感受到了左臂上的冲击。她用光学镜头瞥了一眼，看到一个带翼的卡洛正将手臂深深插入装甲外壳中。警报在她周围响起，诊断屏幕报告污染正通过手臂扩散，并向中央脑室蔓延。突然，手臂一紧，朗基努斯之枪重塑成一把巨大的剑，其尺寸惊人。污染现在正向她的胸部、腿部和头部蔓延，剧烈的疼痛通过神经连接传遍全身。她的背部因疼痛而弓起，视野变窄，身体在插入栓座椅的坚硬表面上抽搐。在通讯中，她隐约听到美里在喊着要她从 EVA 中弹射出去，有那么一刻，她考虑了这个选项。然后，EVA 开始向前走，朝着真嗣的方向，以枪剑为先导。

"Ikari...it will kill Ikari...I cannot a-llow that." She turned in her seat and activated a red-marked panel, exposing the self-destruct lever hidden away there.
"碇...它会杀死碇...我不能允许那样的事情发生。" 她在座位上转身，激活了一个红色标记的面板，露出了隐藏在那里的自毁拉杆。

High above, Gendo noted Rei activating the hidden panel and his eyes widened in suprise at her bold move. He was tempted to override the attempt but found that Fuyutski was slightly shaking his head and gesturing to a readout of data flowing from failed attempts to force eject Rei. All the links were cut off, even the mighty leader of NERV could not interfere.
高处，源堂注意到绫波启动了隐藏的面板，她大胆的举动让他惊讶地睁大了眼睛。他本想干预，但发现冬月轻微地摇头，并指向显示从尝试强制弹出绫波失败的数据流。所有的连接都被切断了，即便是 NERV 的强大领导者也无法介入。

"There can always be another..." He mused quietly.
“总会有下一个……”他若有所思地低声自语。

Shinji backed away from the Eva as it advanced for him, Karou withdrawing his arm from it as it advanced.
真嗣从逼近的 EVA 面前退开，而卡尔则从前进的 EVA 中抽回了自己的手臂。

"Yes my pet, destroy this one, and then yourself afterwards. I hate to use such a filty device but I do have a mission to do. Goodbye Ikari! I hope to see you next time I condemn souls to Hell."
是的，我的宠物，摧毁这个，然后你自己也跟着去吧。我实在不愿使用如此肮脏的手段，但我确实有任务在身。再见了，碇！希望下次我宣判灵魂下地狱时还能见到你。

Before Shinji could reply something unusual happened. The Eva stopped its advance and started to exude light. Then the light coalesced around the Eva and flared. Shinji rapidly raised his AT Field around the explosion and directed it up. He held it that way for a few meager seconds and then as he tired relaxed it around himself, shielding him from the devestating self- destructing Eva. Even with the field in place Shinji was knocked several dozen meters away from where he landed, ending up rolling and tumbling through the false snow and ending up against a sprire of rock that jutted several meters into the air before it sheared off at the tip. In the command bridge it was complete chaos as the destructive energy raced up through the headquarters and then out it, completely coring the entire facility and exposing its innards from top to bottom. Asuka, Toji, and Hikari managed to stumble onto the bridge as the explosion waned and the crew returned to watching the holoscreens. Asuka leaned up on a console near Misato and asked her a question. "Shinji, is he?"
就在真嗣准备回答时，异变突生。EVA 停止了前进，开始散发出光芒。随后，光芒在 EVA 周围凝聚并爆发。真嗣迅速在自己周围展开 AT 力场，将爆炸冲击引导向上。他勉强支撑了几秒钟，随着疲惫感袭来，他放松了力场，将其环绕自身，以抵御 EVA 自毁的毁灭性冲击。即便有 AT 力场保护，真嗣仍被震飞数十米，落在人造雪地上翻滚，最终撞上一根突兀耸立的岩石柱，石柱顶部随即断裂。指挥室内一片混乱，破坏性能量沿着总部向上奔涌，彻底贯穿整个设施，将其内部结构暴露无遗。爆炸平息后，明日香、东治和光跌跌撞撞地来到指挥室，工作人员重新关注起全息屏幕。明日香靠在米萨托旁边的控制台上，焦急地询问：“真嗣，他还好吗？”

"Can't tell...Maya?"

"I'm getting two AT Fields being generated down there, but there both very weak..."
“下面检测到两个 AT 力场正在生成，但都非常微弱……”

Misato grimly smiled and turned back to Asuka. "I'll take that as my yes."
碇真嗣眨了眨眼，正要起身时，注意到一个灰色的模糊身影朝他冲来。出于本能，他向右翻滚，因此只是被塔布里斯击中了侧面。尽管如此，冲击力还是将他们两人抛向了那座破败的岩石尖塔，随后又撞进了下一座，碎石在他们身后崩塌。碇真嗣皱起鼻子，露出厌恶的表情，因为他看到对手烧焦的皮肤和烧毁的头发，整个左侧身体都被爆炸的力量波及。

Asuka moved up next to her and gave Misato a hug, praying and hoping for the best.
明日香走到她身边，给了葛城一个拥抱，祈祷并期待最好的结果。

Shinji blinked his eyes and started to stand when he noticed a gray blur heading for him. Reacting instinctivly he rolled to the right and so was only hit in the side by Tabris. The force of the impact still sent the two of them flying through the wrecked spire of rock and slamming into the next one as it crumble behind them. Shinji crinkled his nose with disgust as he saw his opponents charred skin and burnt hair, the entire left of his body having been caught in the explosions force.
葛城苦笑了一下，转回身面对明日香。“我就当你是同意了。”

"Still...alive...Ikari..." Tabris panted out, having nearly been exhausted in keeping himself alive within the explosion. "Now...your turn..." Tabris reached out behind him and panted heavily as he used his diminished AT Field to lift the snow supporting the Lance of Longinus on the ground. Slowly the whole collabaration drew near and dropped down to within his reach.
"还...活着...碇..." 塔布里斯喘息着说道，在爆炸中几乎耗尽了维持自己生命的力量。"现在...轮到你了..." 塔布里斯向后伸手，沉重地喘息着，用他那已经减弱的 AT 力场抬起地面上的雪，支撑着朗基努斯之枪。慢慢地，整个协作接近并下降到他伸手可及的范围内。

"Now...with the instrument...of an angels...destruction....I will kill....you!" He screamed in Shinji's face, his eyes wide and maniacle with rage. The lance shifted and grew smaller and narrower, reforming itself into a smaller version of the sword Unit 00 had carried. Shinji tried to push the angel off of him but couldn't, his own breath raspy and wet, and a sudden pain shooting through his chest near his lungs. The sword was lifted high above Shinji's breast, the point leading down and the blade gleaming sharply in the cold light of Terminal Dogma.
"现在...用这天使...毁灭的工具...我要杀了...你！" 他对着真嗣的脸尖叫，眼睛睁得大大的，充满了狂怒。长枪变形，变得更小更细，重塑成零号机曾携带的剑的小型版本。真嗣试图推开天使，但做不到，他自己的呼吸急促而湿润，胸腔附近突然传来一阵剧痛。剑被高高举起，剑尖指向真嗣的胸膛，刀刃在终端教条的冷光下闪闪发亮。

"You...should have....joined....me....now DIIIIEEEEEE!!!" Tabris screamed out, echoing off of the ceiling as he drove the point forward into the center of Shinji's heart. Shinji jerked once, twice, and then fell still; the fires in his eyes dying out and leaving him with his normal deep-blue irises.
"你...本应该...加入...我...现在去死吧！！！" 塔布里斯尖叫着，声音在屋顶回荡，他猛地将尖端刺入真嗣的心脏中央。真嗣抽搐了一下，两下，然后静止不动；眼中的火焰熄灭，留下他那双深蓝色的瞳孔。

"....Weak..." Tabris said as he stood and started walking away from the dead shell. Heading for Adam and the completion of his destiny.
"...弱小..." 塔布里斯说着站起身，开始离开那具尸体。他朝着亚当走去，完成他的宿命。

High above the battle, several stared silently as their best hope for survival died in a single stroke. Asuka crumpled to the ground in shock and stared numbly at the floor before her. Misato just cried. Toji wrapped his arm around his girlfriend and said a quick prayer that he would see her and Kensuke in heaven after he died.
在战场的高空，几人默默地注视着，他们生存的最大希望在一击之下消逝。明日香震惊地瘫坐在地上，呆滞地盯着面前的地面。美里只是哭泣。东治搂住他的女友，快速祈祷死后能在天堂见到她和健介。

Third Impact occured. 第三次冲击发生了。

A long strech of beach nearby the ruins of a great city. The city once known as Tokyo-3, the vanguard against the angels attacking the Earth in an attempt to destroy humanity. They had succeeded. Shinji woke to the sound of surf crashing on beach and quickly sat up and glanced around. What he found was a sleeping Asuka Langley Sohryu nearby him, as beautiful as the day he saw her on the aircraft carrier bringing her into his life. He knew what had happened, and he had an inkling in his mind as to what they would be and find in this clensed world. But he didn't mind, because he had someone to share it with. For once in thirteen years he felt as if he was no longer truly lonely anymore. Asuka started to stir next to him.
一片长长的海滩，毗邻着一座伟大城市的废墟。这座城市曾被称为第三新东京市，是抵御试图毁灭人类的天使攻击的前哨。他们成功了。真嗣在海浪拍击沙滩的声音中醒来，迅速坐起身来环顾四周。他发现附近躺着沉睡的明日香·兰格雷，美丽如初见她时，在将她带入他生活的航空母舰上。他知道发生了什么，心中也隐约明白在这个被净化了的世界中他们将成为什么，会找到什么。但他并不介意，因为他有人相伴。十三年来，他第一次感觉自己不再真正孤单。明日香在他身边开始动弹。

End.

Phionex of the Fallen notes: I have finished this fic and I hope all who read it enjoy it as much as I have in writing it. Now I know that its strange in having the Third Impact actually occur by an angels hand, as it doesn't happen in the series. But this is a fanfic: in other words, CREATIVE LICENSE PEOPLE!!! Every story out there ends up either with the characters stopping the impact somehow, or commiting seppukku in creative ways. Depressing you may call my fic, but there is probably worse. Also, in some of the earlier reviews you have complaints about me not using the original names from the series. Well, I just wanted them to have different names, after all: unless you have the DVD's, or unless I was sleeping through parts of the series (I wasn't), they never mention the names of the angels!! Sorry if I offended you by the name change but I can't please everybody all at once and still write in my own style. If you enjoyed this fic I also encourage you to check out my other current postings: Wishfull thinking and its sequel: War of Ascention! Please check them out! Arigato!
《堕落凤凰》笔记：此文已完结，愿每位读者都能如我在创作时那般享受其中。我知让第三次冲击由使徒之手触发颇为异想天开，原作中并未如此发展。然则此乃同人创作，即意味着——创意自由，各位！市面上的故事结局无非角色设法阻止冲击，或以别出心裁之法自裁。或许有人称我的作品为压抑，但料想还有更甚者。此外，早期评论中有人不满我未沿用原作角色名。实则我意欲赋予他们新名，毕竟，除非持有 DVD，或我曾在剧集中打盹（并未如此），原作从未提及使徒之名！若因改名触怒了您，深表歉意，但我无法同时取悦所有人，仍需保持个人写作风格。若您喜欢此文，亦请关注我的其他作品：《一厢情愿》及其续篇《升天之战》！敬请一览，谢谢！
