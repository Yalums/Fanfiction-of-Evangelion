"Please, take this and run far away / Far away from me  
“请，拿着这个远走高飞 / 远离我

I am tainted / The two of us were never meant to be  
我被玷污 / 我们俩从未注定要在一起

All these pieces and promises and left-behinds / If only I could see  
所有这些碎片、承诺和留下的东西 / 只要我能看到就好

In my nothing, you were everything / Everything to me"  
在我的虚无中，你是一切 / 对我来说是一切

### Chapter 1 Similarity/Hidden Fears  

_This place, this place I'm stuck in—it's exactly the same as before. I hate it.  
这个地方，我被困在这里的地方——和以前完全一样。我讨厌它。_

For a world after an apocalypse it appeared remarkably peaceful, remarkably alive; but for Shinji the chaos still roared inside him while the outside appeared just as soft and peaceful as ever. As if he had become this place. On the surface it was just another Japanese urban center, clean and well-organized. Yet what lurked below it was far more sinister. Another NERV command center, hidden underneath the life of this place. And somewhere even deeper than that, lay the sleeping horrors, waiting for a new set of lives to ruin: the Evangelions. Or so he assumed.  
对于一场启示录之后的世界来说，它看起来异常宁静，异常充满生机；但对于真嗣来说，混乱仍在他心中咆哮，而外表看起来像往常一样柔和宁静。仿佛他已经成为了这个地方。表面上，这只是另一个日本城市中心，干净而井然有序。然而，潜藏在其下的却是更加邪恶的东西。另一个 NERV 指挥中心，隐藏在这个地方的生活之下。而更深处，等待着毁灭新生命的恐怖沉睡着：使徒。至少他是这样认为的。

It was dark out now, the kind of darkness only present in the early hours after midnight. Most of the city's electric lighting was out—not all, but for a city the size of Tokyo-2 "most" could make a difference. Only the street lamps illuminated the eerily quiet boulevards and parks dotting between steel and glass monoliths—skyscrapers that faintly reminded of the city he had once destroyed not so long ago. Misato's apartment was sufficiently far away that, to Shinji, it looked as though he might be able to just reach out and pick one of the towers up with his bare hand. And if he'd been in Unit 01 he could have. He shuddered at the idea.  
现在外面漆黑一片，只有午夜过后的凌晨时分才会有的那种黑暗。东京-2 这样规模的城市大部分的电灯都熄灭了——虽然不是全部，但对于一个像东京-2 这样的城市来说，“大部分”可能会有所不同。只有街灯照亮着那些宛如钢铁和玻璃巨塔之间点缀着的宁静幽静的林荫大道和公园——那些摩天大楼微弱地让他想起不久前他曾经摧毁过的城市。美里的公寓离得足够远，以至于在新吉眼里，他似乎可以伸手就能抓住其中一座塔。如果他在零号机里的话，他或许真的可以。一想到这个想法，他不禁打了个寒颤。

It was another one of those nights. Those nights where he couldn't sleep; the nights where he would just go out onto the balcony, look at the city, and think. He would think about NERV. He would think about Evangelion. He would think about Third Impact. And he would wonder, semi-cynically, if anything about the world really was different at all.  
又是那种夜晚。那种他无法入睡的夜晚；他只能走到阳台上，看着城市，思考。他会想起 NERV。他会想起使徒。他会想起第三次冲击。他会半带讽刺地想，世界上到底有什么真正不同吗。

Sure, it was a lot smaller than before; some people still hadn't returned from Third Impact—more than half were still "somewhere" out in that immense lake of LCL and DNA, unable or unwilling to return. Shinji would think about that lake and think about all the people in his life on nights like this one. And he would think to himself, _nothing's changed. I'm still just alone as I ever was._  
当然，这个世界比以前小多了；一些人仍然没有从第三次冲击中回来 — 超过一半的人仍然“某处”漂浮在那一片无边的 LCL 和 DNA 之湖中，无法或不愿回来。在像今晚这样的夜晚，新吉会想起那片湖，想起他生命中的所有人。他会自言自语，没有什么改变。我还是像以往一样孤独。

_Tomorrow__is the one-year-anniversary of Third Impact. One year since the biggest mistake I ever made._  
明天是第三次冲击的一周年纪念日。距离我犯下的最大错误已经过去一年了。

Shinji had always blamed himself for what had happened—a notion most of NERV did not share. Even Asuka had forgiven at one particularly unusual moment, drawn away from her typical self in the closest thing he could recall as being sympathy from her. It didn't get rid of the guilt though; he guarded it and clutched at it as if it was the only thing keeping him alive anymore.  
新吉一直责怪自己发生的事情 — 大多数 NERV 的人并不认同这种观念。即使是明日香在一个特别不同寻常的时刻也原谅了他，远离了她典型的自我，这是他能记得的最接近同情的事情。但这并没有消除内疚；他像抓住最后一根稻草一样保护着它，紧紧抓住它，仿佛这是唯一让他继续活着的东西。

He was fifteen now, almost sixteen. High school was still a struggle. Normality wasn't completely in place but it was returning, filling in the darker spaces of the world all the time. His dealings with NERV were almost minimal. He hadn't worn a plug suit in what seemed like an eternity. He could still remember what LCL smelled like though—that tinge of blood over mechanically clean nothing.  
他现在十五岁，快十六岁了。高中依然是一场挣扎。正常生活还没有完全恢复，但它正在回归，填补世界中那些更黑暗的角落。他与 NERV 的接触几乎微乎其微。他已经有很久没有穿插件服了。尽管如此，他仍然记得 LCL 的气味——那种血腥的味道掩盖在机械清洁的虚无之上。

But life after Eva wasn't any easier—it wasn't as he had imagined. His disconnection with Misato had only grown after the immensely happy moments of her return to the world of the living. Even though they'd held each other with tears in their eyes the day she'd come walking out of that lake. Even though she'd shushed away his strangled voice that he had "left her to die" as he cowered, crying in that elevator nearly one year ago.  
但是，EVA 之后的生活并不更容易——并不像他想象的那样。他与美里的疏远在她重返世界的那些极其幸福的时刻之后只是加剧了。尽管他们在她从湖中走出来的那一天相拥而泣。尽管她在那电梯里，他哭泣着低声说他“让她去死”，她却安抚着他。那已经是将近一年前的事了。

_How could you, how could you, how could you...  
你怎么能，你怎么能，你怎么能…_

Only six months ago he thought he'd finally give back that white cross of hers. The one he'd been wearing with such a heavy heart. The one he would hold onto so tightly when he felt like crying for the only person in his life he felt had ever genuinely cared about him. But that day Misato would not take it back, and the cross stayed with him. As did the weight of it, the guilt never seeming to leave from its dangling position over his chest.  
只有六个月前，他以为他终于会把她的那枚白色十字架还给她。他一直佩戴着它，心情沉重。每当他觉得想为他生命中唯一真正关心过他的人哭泣时，他都会紧紧抓住它。但那天，美里并没有把它拿回去，十字架留在了他身边。它的重量也留在了他身上，那种愧疚似乎永远挥之不去，悬挂在他的胸前。

Slowly, he drifted back into social isolation. Asuka, though he rarely tried, refused to let him in past those carefully crafted walls of anger, pushing him away with every attempt. Touji was still his good friend. He and Kensuke were friends. Hikari too, maybe. But Rei was gone. _Father is gone..._  
慢慢地，他又陷入了社交孤立之中。明日香，虽然他很少尝试，却拒绝让他突破那些被愤怒构筑起来的墙壁，每次都用力推开他。刀司仍然是他的好朋友。他和健介是朋友。还有光也许也是。但是，惠理已经离开了。父亲也走了……

A life without Gendou and Evangelion: it was what Shinji had always imagined he wanted. And now that he had it he found himself still depressed, still disconnected from those he wanted to be close with, and still just as lonely as ever.  
没有了玄冬和使徒：这正是新吉一直想象中想要的生活。现在他拥有了，却发现自己依然沮丧，依然与那些他想亲近的人疏远，依然孤独如初。

They had warned him, in the hazy memories immersed in Instrumentality that returning the world to the way it was would simply put back all of the barriers between people—AT Fields. This cruel juxtaposition that made human beings so unique but also an ultimately isolated creature. And now Shinji seemed to have become the epitome of this painful conclusion. His further alienation from those around him only strengthened these darker feelings hiding beneath the memories of his piloting days.  
他们曾经警告过他，在浸润在仪表化中的朦胧记忆中，让世界回到原样只会重新建立人与人之间的所有障碍——AT 场。这种残酷的并置使人类如此独特，但也是一种最终孤立的生物。而现在，新吉似乎已经成为这个痛苦结论的典范。他与周围人的进一步疏远只加强了这些隐藏在他驾驶机体日子记忆下的更黑暗的感受。

He looked over the railing of the balcony now; it was four stories to the sidewalk and asphalt below. _Probably enough to kill me._ He didn't really believe he was suicidal; maybe he wanted to die but he was far too afraid to take his own life. But the dark thoughts were a grim reminder of the way he felt about his life. _Worthless. Just like father must have thought, as he left me that day._  
他现在俯视着阳台的栏杆；距离人行道和下面的沥青有四层楼高。可能足以致命。他并不真的相信自己有自杀倾向；也许他想死，但他太害怕自己动手。但那些黑暗的想法是对他对生活感受的残酷提醒。毫无价值。就像父亲那天离开我的时候一样。

Misato was concerned though she'd never admit it. She could see the signs—signs that Shinji was regressing back to the way he had been before he'd ever arrived in Tokyo-3. He was on the same sort of collision course she'd seen only once before: with Asuka. And she knew that sooner or later something was going to break.  
美里虽然很担心，但她从不承认。她看到了迹象——新吉正在倒退回到他来到第三新东京之前的状态。他正朝着一种她只见过一次的冲突轨迹前进：与明日香。她知道，迟早会有什么事情发生。

What was it that distressed him so greatly? What had pushed him back into the perpetual silences and shyness that had plagued him so much before? Was it the very thing he had thought he wanted?  
是什么让他如此痛苦？是什么让他重新陷入之前一直困扰他的沉默和羞怯？难道这就是他曾经认为自己想要的东西吗？

The disappearance of his father.  
他父亲的消失。

Though he may have wanted to escape from Gendou, having him removed suddenly and permanently had just created a wound. It was a gaping hole where all of the anger he had gathered for the man he hated so much just sat and pooled. And waited. For something bad enough or someone foolish enough to open up that scar and peer inside.  
虽然他或许曾想逃离葛栋，但突然而永久地将他移除只是制造了一个伤口。那是一个巨大的洞，聚集了他对这个讨厌的男人所积蓄的所有愤怒。等待着。等待着足够糟糕的事情或者愚蠢到足以打开那道伤疤并窥视其中的人。

Lurking somewhere beneath that placid calm of a healthy if somewhat shy teenager was the same sort of rage that came roaring to life during the few instances of Unit-01's reactivation—the berserker rage. This terrifying thing that had always been hiding in Shinji's subconscious, only ever fully revealed inside an Eva.  
在那位健康但有些害羞的少年表面平静的下面，隐藏着一种与第一号单位重新启动时爆发的愤怒相同的愤怒——狂暴的愤怒。这种可怕的东西一直隐藏在真嗣的潜意识中，只有在 Eva 内部完全显露出来。

Now, with no Evangelion to pilot, no father to hate, the rage gathered. And brooded.  
现在，没有 Eva 可驾驶，也没有可憎恨的父亲，愤怒在积聚。在沉思。

_Maybe I should just run away.  
也许我应该就跑了。_

The wind answered, twirling his dark bangs so that they danced above his head. He sighed, pulled open the door to the balcony, and disappeared back inside the apartment. Back into his room where he undressed and lay down on the covers of his futon. He would not sleep tonight.  
风回答道，旋转着他深色的刘海，使它们在他头顶上舞动。他叹了口气，拉开阳台的门，然后消失在公寓里。回到他的房间，脱下衣服躺在床垫上。今晚他不会入睡。

-

"Baka, get up!" “笨蛋，起床！”

There was no answer. Asuka just watched the door, not so different from Shinji's front door in their first apartment. _Back when we were fighting Angels_.  
没有回应。明日香只是看着门，与新居的第一扇门并无二致。那时我们在对抗使徒。

She thought, ear pressed firmly against the door, that she could just hear him breathing faintly on the other side. Though the layout was different, they had purchased most of the amenities contained within their original home in Tokyo-3 to give the apartment a similar feel. Slightly bigger and slightly more modern maybe, but when she would look out the windows, it still looked like Tokyo-3 outside so it still felt like their old apartment inside. _But it's Tokyo-2 now... things are different. We're different._  
她觉得，耳朵紧贴在门上，仿佛能听到对面他微弱的呼吸声。虽然布局不同，他们在东京-3 的原居所里购置了大部分设施，让公寓有了类似的感觉。或许稍微更大，稍微更现代一些，但当她望向窗外，外面依然是东京-3，所以里面仍然感觉像他们的旧公寓。但现在是东京-2... 事情不同了。我们也不同了。

She craned her neck, desperate to hear any reaction, something she could justify as a sign of waking. Nothing answered. Now upon closer inspection it didn't even sound as if there was anyone in there at all. If there had been any breathing it had ceased. Momentary worry coursed through the back of her mind as if Shinji could have been possibly stupid enough to have choked on his own pillow at that very instant.  
她伸长脖子，渴望听到任何反应，希望能找到一些理由证明他醒着。没有回应。仔细听时，甚至听不到里面有人的声音。如果有呼吸声，现在也停止了。一瞬间的担忧涌入她的脑海，仿佛新居竟然可能发生了什么让新吉在那一瞬间被自己的枕头闷住的愚蠢事情。

"BAKAAAA!" she roared. “笨蛋！”她咆哮道。

She yanked the door open, deciding that even if he was naked or worse she could always avert her eyes. But there was no Shinji doing perverted things to himself or even snoring peacefully asleep—there was no Shinji at all, just some ruffled covers on a futon and tatami. Her expression of anger, her eyebrows which had been scrunched so deeply, her grimace which had been so exquisitely crafted into utter and total disgust; it all fell to nothing as she said "Oh" and lost all grip on her well-honed anger.  
她猛地拉开门，决定即使他赤裸或更糟，她也可以避开视线。但是门后并没有正在对自己做下流事情或安然打呼的真嗣——根本没有真嗣，只有榻榻米上凌乱的被子。她满脸愤怒的表情，那深深皱起的眉头，那被精心塑造成彻底厌恶的鬼脸；当她说出“哦”并完全失去对自己磨练已久的愤怒的控制时，这一切都化为乌有。

_Should have known. 早该知道的。_

She sighed. It was quite typical Shinji behavior actually. Whenever there was any decent reason to be mad at him (although it had only been his late waking this morning) he would be absent, if not physically then at least mentally. She had used to be able to get to him but, not any more—not since Third Impact.  
她叹了口气。其实，真嗣的行为相当典型。每当有任何理由生他的气时（尽管只是因为他今天早上起得晚），他总是缺席，至少在精神上是这样。她曾经能够影响他，但现在不行了——自第三次冲击以来。

All of the mean things she could think of saying to him, even the nastiest ones, garnered little to no reaction nowadays. Physical violence was no better; she had tried on a handful of occasions but Shinji was strange, unresponsive. Like a broken little doll he would just sit there and get kicked or slapped, not doing anything to stop it. It got a few tears out of him most of the time but never any real crying—mostly pathetic weakness, no real pain.  
她能想到的所有刻薄话，甚至最恶毒的话，如今都几乎没有引起任何反应。身体上的暴力也不行；她尝试过几次，但真嗣很奇怪，毫无反应。就像一个破损的小玩偶，他只会坐在那里被踢或打，不做任何反抗。这样做大多数时候会让他流泪，但从来没有真正的哭泣——大多是可怜的软弱，没有真正的痛苦。

_Nothing like what I went through... this spoiled little punk; he has no idea what real pain is.  
根本不像我经历过的那样... 这个被宠坏的小混球；他根本不知道什么是真正的痛苦。_

It was the unresponsiveness that bothered Asuka the most about Shinji now. Every day he seemed to become more and more like Rei: quiet, withdrawn, almost emotionless. It terrified her, though she would never admit it. And Misato had always gotten in the way before she could inflict any real damage. Or give him any idea of why she felt the need to do these things to him. Before she could really give him a piece of her mind.  
现在最让明日香困扰的是新吉的冷漠。每天他似乎变得越来越像零：安静、内向，几乎没有情感。这让她感到恐惧，尽管她永远不会承认。而且在她能造成真正伤害之前，美里总是挡在中间。或者在她能让他明白为什么她觉得有必要对他做这些事之前。在她真正发泄怒火之前。

But Asuka was truly happy today—she had finally concocted a scheme that she was sure would elicit some sort of real response from the boy she was nearly obsessed with. She would finally hurt him this time—get him where she'd never gotten him before.  
但今天明日香真的很开心——她终于想出了一个计划，她确信这次会引起那个她几乎痴迷的男孩做出某种真实的反应。这一次她终于会伤害他——让他受伤的地方，她以前从未触及过。

He had few weak spot when it came to verbal abuse and Third Impact was one—she had already tried mentioning the events of it a number of times to him; it could hurt him she had seen but it was not the sort of pain she enjoyed inflicting on him. It was quiet, contained pain. _Not fun at all._ No, what she wanted was response, action on his part. Something to convince her that he was another doll—_not that goddamned doll Rei!_  
在进行口头辱骂时，他有一些弱点，第三次冲击就是其中之一——她已经试过多次向他提及这些事件；她看到这会伤害到他，但这不是她享受施加在他身上的那种痛苦。那是安静、内敛的痛苦。一点也不有趣。不，她想要的是回应，他的行动。一些能让她确信他只是另一个娃娃的东西——而不是那该死的零！

She slowed her breathing back down, calming herself. He had run away. One had to expect these kinds of things when dealing with Shinji Ikari. Today was the anniversary after all; the high school was even taking some class time to hold a special meeting in the auditorium in honor of the three pilots who had "saved the world."  
她放慢呼吸，让自己平静下来。他逃走了。当与碇真嗣打交道时，必须预料到这种情况。毕竟今天是周年纪念日；高中甚至抽出一些课时在礼堂举行特别会议，以纪念那三名“拯救世界”的飞行员。

That was most likely why he had run away—Shinji, she knew, was uncomfortable with any praise. And he still felt guilty about Third Impact, felt guilty for all of the people who had left the planet for that pool of LCL and never returned.  
这很可能就是他逃走的原因——她知道，真嗣对任何赞美都感到不舒服。他仍然为第三次冲击感到内疚，为那些离开地球、永远不再回来的人们感到内疚。

_No, no, Shinji, don't be happy that what you did saved Misato's life! Go ahead and be sad that Fuyutsuki and some people you don't even know are gone. Idiot. Be upset because you gave Touji his arm and leg back! Be sad that the father that treated you like shit isn't here to spit on you anymore. You pathetic shit.  
不，不，真嗣，不要因为你的所作所为拯救了美里的生命而感到高兴！继续为藤槻和一些你甚至不认识的人离去而感到悲伤。白痴。为了给刀二恢复手臂和腿而感到沮丧！为了那个对你如粪土般对待的父亲不在这里再吐你而感到悲伤。你这个可悲的家伙。_

"Misatoooo," she growled, poking her head around the corner to aim at the kitchen.  
她怒气冲冲地喊道：“米莎托，”伸头探出角落，瞄准厨房。

"Whaaaat?" she heard faintly from Misato's airy voice mixed in with the sounds of various kitchenwares at work. _Misato making breakfast?_ Well some things really had changed, she supposed.  
她听到米莎托轻快的声音中夹杂着各种厨房用具的声音，她有些吃惊地想，米莎托在做早餐？她想，有些事情确实发生了变化。

"I think we have a bit of a problem. I think Shinji ran away... like always."  
“我觉得我们有点问题。我觉得真嗣又跑了……像往常一样。”

"What was that, Asuka?" Misato called back to her charge, her voice calm with the soothing stroke of her morning beer.  
“明日香，你说什么？”美里望向她的扶养者，声音平静，带着清晨啤酒的抚慰之意。

"I said," Asuka began, inhaling. "SHINJI RAN AWAY!"  
“我说，”明日香开始，吸了口气。“碇真司逃走了！”

Asuka heard the shattering sound of a plate falling out of Misato's grip and onto something hard. She walked into the kitchen, arms crossed, staring at her guardian who was looking into the sink. Misato was still just as beautiful as she had ever been pre-Impact. Her purple tangles of long hair lay over her shoulders, thrown semi-carelessly. Her brow was contracted, putting wrinkles on her normally flawless face. That impeccable smile was curved downwards now, hidden beneath those immense lips, in a tiny frown.  
明日香听到一声盘子摔落的声音，从美里手中滑落到坚硬的东西上。她走进厨房，双臂交叉，盯着她的监护人，后者正凝视着水槽。美里依旧像冲击前一样美丽。她那一头紫色的长发随意地披在肩上。她的眉头紧锁，在原本无瑕的脸上刻上了皱纹。那完美的微笑此刻变成了微小的皱眉，隐藏在那宽厚的嘴唇下。

"Shit," Misato said. “该死，”美里说。

There was an awkward silence as the two of them stared at each other. Misato returned her gaze to whatever was left of their meal in the sink.  
两人尴尬地对视着彼此，沉默了下来。美里把目光转向水槽里剩下的饭菜。

"Shit," she said again. 她又说：“该死。”

"Exactly. And the school is expecting him today! This is supposed to be a real big honor and he's really going to look like a jerk if he doesn't even bother to show up."  
“没错。学校今天等着他呢！这可是个很大的荣誉，如果他连露个面都懒得的话，他看起来会很白痴。”

"I know, I know!" Misato said, waving a hand in the air as if being accused. She tried to salvage whatever she had been cooking for breakfast. Asuka remarked as she watched her motions that for once it didn't look like her guardian had drunk her usual morning beer or two after all.  
"“我知道，我知道！”美里说着，挥舞着手好像被指责了一样。她试图挽救她正在做的早餐。明日香看着她的动作，这一次似乎她的监护人并没有像往常一样早上喝上一两杯啤酒。”

"Not to mention Rei. That's showing her a lot of respect…" Asuka continued, trying to find some way to really push Misato's buttons this morning, mostly because she didn't have Shinji to pick on at the moment.  
"“更不用说惠了。这样对她表示尊重…”明日香继续说着，今早试图找到一些方法来刺激美里的神经，主要是因为她此刻没有新助来取笑。”

"Asuka, stop it!" Misato said, staring her down. She looked deadly serious now. "You know Shinji appreciates Rei's... sacrifice just as much as anyone else. He just doesn't know how to show it; he doesn't know what to do with any of his feelings these days. It's the kind of person he is. You, of all people Asuka, should know that by now."  
“明日香，住手！”美里严肃地说道，目光坚定。她现在看起来非常认真。“你知道，新吉对丽的……牺牲和任何人一样感激。他只是不知道如何表达；他不知道如何处理他这些天的任何感情。这就是他的性格。你，明日香，作为所有人中的你，现在应该知道这一点。”

And Asuka did know that. Maybe even more so than Misato. But it didn't stop her from being mad at him. Mad at all of the things he had screwed up for her. _Why does she always side with you!_  
而明日香确实知道这一点。甚至可能比美里更了解。但这并不能阻止她对他生气。对他为她搞砸的所有事情感到愤怒。为什么她总是站在你这边！

"Try telling that to the principal then..." Asuka replied after a moment, easily growing sarcastic. "'Oh, Shinji? Well he's not coming to your big honorary ceremony for him today as a sign of his respect.' Riiiiiight."  
“试着告诉校长吧……”明日香沉默片刻后回答，轻松地变得讽刺起来。“‘哦，新吉？嗯，他不会来参加你今天的大型表彰仪式，以示他的尊重。’ 没错。”

Misato made an ugly face at Asuka and stuck out her tongue.  
美里对明日香做了个丑脸，伸出舌头。

"Well I'm still trying to figure that bit out. You're really trouble today... what's got you in such a good mood?" Misato asked, one eyebrow cocked.  
“嗯，我还在努力弄清楚这一点。你今天真是麻烦…是什么让你心情这么好？”美里问道，一只眉毛挑起。

"Nothing..." Asuka said, grinning.  
“没什么…”明日香咧嘴笑着说。

Misato did not pry any further and Asuka was happy to continue her breakfast in silence, plotting every nuance and detail of her revenge on Shinji Ikari today.  
美里没有再多问，明日香也乐意保持沉默，继续享用早餐，心里盘算着今天对碇真嗣的报复的每一个细微之处。

-

A bird was chirping somewhere. The early morning air was surprisingly brisk, cool to his skin. He shivered and walked faster, cupping his hands around each one of the short sleeves on his white shirt.  
某处传来一只鸟的鸣叫声。清晨的空气出奇地凉爽，触及他的皮肤时感到一阵寒意。他打了个寒战，加快脚步，双手捧住他白衬衫的短袖。

The sun was floating lazily up, its orange glow gleaming at him from in between the towering steel fingers of the skyscrapers in the distance. Some of those sky-scrapers hadn't even been there six months ago. But six months ago Misato popped out of nowhere and NERV suddenly had a real commander instead of the delegated Maya Ibuki. And six months ago Misato had turned herself into a self-made contractor with the help of government loans.  
太阳慢慢升起，橙色的光芒从远处高耸的钢铁巨塔间闪耀着。其中一些摩天大楼六个月前甚至还不存在。但六个月前，美里突然冒出来，NERV 突然有了一位真正的指挥官，而不再是被委派的伊吹玛丽亚。六个月前，美里借助政府贷款，将自己变成了一个自给自足的承包商。

To the unobservant citizen he would look just like any other high school student, up a bit early perhaps, but not unusual. There were five major high schools in Tokyo-2, each with enough students to make the uniforms rather commonplace. But if one looked close enough, beyond the brown bangs and into the dark eyes aimed at the pavement, maybe, just maybe, they would recognize the face of what was easily the most famous high school student in the entire world now. The soft, shy features of a hero.  
对于那些不太注意的市民来说，他看起来就像是任何一个高中学生，也许起得有点早，但并不奇怪。东京-2 有五所主要的高中，每所学校的学生人数都足够多，使得校服变得相当普通。但如果有人仔细观察，超越那棕色的刘海，看进那盯着地面的深邃眼眸，也许，只是也许，他们会认出这张脸，这张现在很可能是全世界最著名的高中生的脸。一个英雄般柔和、害羞的面容。

NERV, under the careful direction of Misato, had released some heavily edited footage of the battles with the Angels to the public as well as some footage of the pilots. He and Asuka, as if they hadn't been under enough scrutiny, were now frequently assailed by crazed fans. This was the only reason that Shinji actually appreciated Section Two constantly trailing him and Asuka around the city. Even Touji had a team of guards. Misato had always chalked it up to paranoia on the part of the Japanese government. These children were their claim to fame (and Germany's claim in Asuka's case).  
NERV，在冒着风险的米莎托的精心指导下，向公众发布了一些与使徒战斗有关的经过大幅剪辑的录像，以及一些有关驾驶员的录像。他和明日香，仿佛他们还没有受到足够多的审查一样，现在经常受到疯狂粉丝的袭击。这是新世纪福音战士中的真希望，真希望真正感激第二部门不断跟踪他和明日香在城市周围的原因。甚至铁次也有一队保镖。米莎托总是把这归咎于日本政府的偏执狂。这些孩子是他们的名声之所在（对于明日香来说，也是德国的名声之所在）。

Rei was, officially at least, dead. All of the bizarre truths surrounding her and the Dummy Plug project were concealed from the public eye—it was a secret he shared now only with Asuka, Misato, and Ritsuko and possibly a few other NERV staff; Asuka only knew the entirety of it from seeing the towering white face before the AT field holding it together decayed in those first hopeless days on that beach.  
Rei 在官方文件中已经死亡。围绕她和 Dummy Plug 项目的所有离奇真相都被隐瞒在公众视线之外——现在只有他与明日香、美里、莉茜科以及可能还有一些 NERV 员工分享这个秘密；明日香只是从在那个海滩上无望的最初几天看到那个高耸的白色面孔，以及它所支撑的 AT 力场崩溃的全过程才了解了全部情况。

The face that had been his first sight in the newly reconstructed world; now it didn't even exist. The spot where it had been was supposedly like a rain forest now, one of its edges close to the lake that was Tokyo-3. He'd never been there. He didn't ever intend to go.  
这张脸曾是他在新重建的世界中看到的第一景象；现在它甚至都不存在了。它曾经所在的地方现在据说像一个雨林，其中一边靠近东京-3 的湖泊。他从未去过那里。他也不打算去。

He looked up and down the quiet, tree-lined streets of his neighborhood. He was close to the train station now, maybe another block or two at the most. There was some traffic but most of it was moving so quickly that no one would really have time to look at him or even recognize him.  
他抬头看了看他所在社区安静、绿树成荫的街道。他离火车站很近了，也许最多还有一两个街区。有一些交通，但大多数车辆都行驶得如此迅速，以至于没有人真的有时间看他，甚至认出他。

Shinji sensed movement behind his shoulder. _Section Two,_ he thought. If he was really going to get away this time, he reasoned, he was going to have to get away from them. He quickly jogged through the street, not even crossing at a crosswalk. He put himself in a position that would force the agent to compromise himself and the shadow around the corner fell back, leaving room for another agent to hone in on him instead.  
新吉感觉到肩膀后面有动静。第二部门，他想。如果他真的要这次逃脱，他推理道，他必须摆脱他们。他迅速穿过街道，甚至不在人行横道处过马路。他让自己处于一个位置，迫使特工暴露自己，拐角处的阴影退后，为另一名特工取而代之。

Shinji used this against the security team's efforts and, guessing where next agent would come from, turned down a difficult to see back alley. It was a particular shortcut he had never used to get to the station, one he had been saving for a day like today. A "vacation" day.  
新吉利用这一点对抗安保团队的努力，猜测下一个特工会从哪里出现，转向一个难以察觉的小巷。这是一个他从未用过的特别捷径，他一直在为今天这样的日子保留着。一个“休假”日子。

It worked. Shinji was at the station two minutes later and he could see no one, not even a shadow of a person nearby. Satisfied, he boarded the train, not even bothering to check where it was headed.  
奏效了。两分钟后，新吉就到了车站，他看不到任何人，甚至附近也看不到一个人的影子。满意地上了火车，甚至都没费心查看它的目的地。

He spotted one of the Section Two suits again as the train pulled out of the station. The man had two fingers pressed to his earpiece, clearly speaking to someone through his collar-mic; Shinji could not see his face: the man's back was turned to him and the escaping train.  
当火车驶出车站时，新吉再次看到了二课的一名特工。这个人用两根手指按着耳机，显然是通过领口麦克风与某人交谈；新吉看不到他的脸：那人背对着他，火车正在远去。

-

Misato had been running around the apartment like a madwoman. She was speaking, or rather screaming, into her NERV cellular phone, not her regular personal phone. Asuka knew what that meant: Section Two was getting its ass pounded right now.  
美里像个疯女人一样在公寓里到处乱跑。她正在用 NERV 的手机说话，或者更确切地说是在尖叫。明日香知道这意味着什么：二课现在正在受到严厉打击。

From what Asuka had bothered to listen to, Misato was trying to get in contact with Section Two and find him before he got too far away. And Section Two, being Section Two, happened to have lost him this morning.  
根据明日香听到的内容，美里正试图与二课取得联系，并在他离得太远之前找到他。而二课，作为二课，今天早上竟然把他给弄丢了。

Asuka was certain from the tone of Misato's voice that quite a few people had been fired today as a result of what Shinji had done this morning. _Nice job costing them their incomes, Shinji. You're being a real jerk today and I bet you don't even know it or care. Like always._  
明日香从美里的语气中可以确定，由于今早新吉的所作所为，今天肯定有不少人被解雇了。干得好，新吉，你让他们失去了收入。今天你真是个混蛋，而且我打赌你自己都不知道或者不在乎。一如既往。

Misato finally re-entered the kitchen looking thoroughly more worn out than she had looked fifteen minutes ago.  
美里最终重新走进厨房，看起来比十五分钟前疲惫多了。

"I'm taking you to school," she announced to the redhead.  
“我送你去学校，”她对红发女孩宣布道。

Asuka just stared at her with a "you going tell me more?" look. Misato caved as she always did to this expression. Asuka was too much like a little sister to her now to resist.  
明日香只是盯着她，带着一种“你要告诉我更多吗？”的表情。美里总是在这种表情面前屈服。现在，明日香对她来说太像一个妹妹，让她无法抗拒。

"Those idiots couldn't keep track of him, of course. They think he caught a train at that station a few blocks from here but they aren't sure and they don't even know what direction he's going if he's even on that line. Idiots."  
“那些白痴当然跟丢了他。他们认为他在离这里几个街区远的那个车站赶上了火车，但他们不确定，甚至不知道他要去哪个方向，如果他真的在那条线上的话。白痴。”

Asuka agreed with her guardian for once. She still feigned being mad, deciding it was best to keep up appearances.  
明日香这次竟然同意了她的监护人。她仍然假装生气，决定最好保持表面。

"So Shinji gets to skip school and I have to go, eh? Nice and fair, don't you think?" she said, false-venom lacing her words so easily.  
“所以新吉可以逃课，而我却要去，是吧？公平又美妙，你不觉得吗？”她说，话语中带着虚伪的毒液，轻而易举地流露出来。

"Oh stop it, Asuka. Besides, if we can't find Shinji in time, we need at least two of you to be there for this thing," Misato said, slipping into her room to get dressed.  
“哦，别闹了，明日香。再说，如果我们找不到新吉，我们至少需要你们两个人在那里参加这件事情，”美里说着，溜进她的房间去换衣服。

Asuka grunted but didn't protest any further. She actually, despite her attitude, wanted to go to school today. It was school after all, where she could make her revenge come to fruition. But then she had a worrying thought. _What if Shinji doesn't show up in time?_ She reasoned that she could always try again, once he was back in the apartment and going to school. _But it won't be the same—not like today_. _Because today's the anniversary._  
明日香咕哝了一声，但没有进一步抗议。尽管态度强硬，她实际上是想今天去上学的。毕竟学校是个地方，她可以让她的复仇计划实现。但她突然担心起来。如果新吉没能及时出现怎么办？她推断她总能再试一次，一旦他回到公寓并去上学。但那不会一样——不像今天。因为今天是周年纪念日。

Maybe, some other day, even her great plan would have no effect on the boy who seemed to only grow colder. But today, she was sure, today he would notice. And it would hurt! She grinned to herself.  
也许，在另一天，即使她的伟大计划对这个似乎只变得更冷漠的男孩没有影响。但是今天，她确信，今天他会注意到。而且会受伤！她对自己咧嘴一笑。

"Misato, you better find him. I don't want to be the only idiot up on that stage when they do this stupid ceremony," she whined at her guardian's bedroom door.  
“美里，你最好找到他。当他们进行这愚蠢的仪式时，我可不想是唯一一个傻瓜站在那个舞台上，”她在监护人的卧室门口抱怨道。

"I know, I know," Misato replied, cracking open the door as she made the sounds of someone struggling with a uniform.  
“我知道，我知道，”美里回答道，一边打开门，一边发出一个像是在挣扎着穿制服的声音。

Suddenly the door popped open and Misato looked (miraculously) ready for work.  
门突然打开，美里（奇迹般地）已经准备好上班了。

"Now get in the car before you're late for school," she said, making crazy hand motions towards the door.  
“现在快上车，别迟到上学了，”她说着，向门口做出疯狂的手势。

Asuka grabbed her briefcase, grumbling to herself all the while. After a moment's pause, she turned and went back around the corner, back into Shinji's room and retrieved his briefcase as well. She grumbled a little louder now as she walked to the elevator, one case in each hand.  
明日香抓起自己的公文包，一边嘟囔着。停顿片刻后，她转身回到拐角处，又走回到真嗣的房间，拿起他的公文包。她一手拿一个公文包，嘟囔声更大了些，走向电梯。

Misato, noticing the gesture as she locked the door, smiled at her charge. Perhaps she suspected that this crazy girl really did have feelings for him. She would have never guessed the strange malevolence Asuka harbored for him, the sort of hatred that could even appear as love sometimes; she could not guess what Asuka had planned.  
在锁上门时注意到这个手势的美里冲她的扶养者微笑。也许她怀疑这个疯狂的女孩真的对他有感情。她永远不会猜到明日香对他怀有的奇怪恶意，那种有时甚至会表现为爱的仇恨；她无法猜到明日香打算做什么。

-

Shinji glanced out the window again, his new SDAT's headphones firmly secured over his ears and blaring.  
新的 SDAT 耳机牢牢地戴在耳朵上，声音洪亮。

He had been listening to the radio for a change and one of the lyrics had just been "What the hell, you've got nothing else to lose." He didn't recognize the song but the lyric fit his mood and he smiled, or at least did as best he could; it felt like he hadn't smiled in a long, long time. It felt almost strange to be making that expression on his face.  
他换了换收音机，一首歌的歌词刚好是“见鬼，你已经没有别的东西可以失去了。”他不认识这首歌，但歌词却契合了他的心情，他微笑了，或者至少尽力而为；感觉好像很久很久没有笑过了。在他脸上做出这种表情几乎感觉很奇怪。

He looked out the window again, watching the greenery flicker by at speed. He had noticed over the duration of the trip that he was slowly getting further and further away from the center of Tokyo-2. _Good_, he thought. _The further the better._  
他再次望向窗外，看着绿色的景观在窗外飞速掠过。他注意到在整个旅程中，他慢慢地离开了东京-2 的中心。很好，他想。离得越远越好。

He had never been on this direction coming from that particular station; he was just happy to know he was leaving the city. The closer to downtown he got, the more frequent the cameras from NERV.  
他从那个特定的车站出发，从未朝这个方向前行过；他只是高兴地知道自己正在离开这座城市。他越靠近市中心，NERV 的摄像头就越频繁。

If he went into the city and then tried to get off the train, Section Two would probably pick him up. And Misato would inevitably come driving up. She'd probably talk to him. She'd probably be nice to him. But Shinji wanted freedom today, not a pep-talk. "_Go be a hero for once, Shinji"... yeah right._  
如果他进城然后试图下火车，第二部门可能会接他。而且美里肯定会开车过来。她可能会和他说话。她可能会对他很好。但是新吉今天想要的是自由，而不是一场鼓励谈话。“新吉，去当一次英雄吧”……搞笑。

Honestly he just didn't want to think about what happened one year ago today; he had no desire to remember any of the dark days leading up to it either. But he was finally getting away. _No need to worry. Don't think about it. It's not your fault. You didn't let them die. You didn't do it._  
说实话，他只是不想想起一年前发生的事情；他也不想记起任何导致那一切的黑暗日子。但他终于要离开了。不用担心。别想那些事。这不是你的错。你没有让他们死去。你没有做那件事。

He grew anxious listening to the song and quickly turned off the SDAT, tucking it back into his pocket. The car was empty except for him. No one really had any reason to be going out of the city, not this far out at least, and not at this time of day.  
他听着那首歌变得焦虑，赶紧关掉了 SDAT，把它塞回口袋里。车里除了他之外空无一人。没有人真的有理由离开城市，至少不会走这么远，也不会在这个时候出门。

When the train pulled into the next stop, he decided to get off and he made his way out of the tiny, empty station. If there was anyone else on the train, they didn't exit. There was only one street running next to the station, and the only building he could see from the train platform was a tiny convenience store down to his right. To his left, the road continued on and up into the hilly forests that were the outskirts of the city.  
当火车驶入下一站时，他决定下车，走出了那个狭小空无一人的车站。如果火车上还有其他人，他们没有下车。车站旁边只有一条街，他能从火车站台上看到的唯一建筑是右边的一个小便利店。在他的左边，道路继续向上延伸进入那座城市郊区的多山森林。

Shinji began strolling down the street headed towards the left of the station and out into the wilderness. After a few curves in the road he came upon a giant sign, painted blue on the left shoulder of the road. In huge white letters it read:  
新吉开始沿着街道往车站左侧走去，走出城市进入荒野。在路上转了几个弯后，他看到了一个巨大的标志，路边左侧涂成蓝色。用巨大的白色字母写着：

Ayanami National Forest 绫波国家森林

Next Exit 下一个出口

_Rei._

Shinji stopped dead. At least some of the thoughts he had been busy forgetting today came flying back at him. Memories of Rei's design. He was halted by a name he had not expected to ever see again. Halted by the memory of a person he never fully understood.  
新吉停了下来。他一直在忙于忘记的一些想法又回到了他的脑海中。对 Rei 的设计的记忆。他被一个他从未想过会再次见到的名字所阻止。被一个他从未完全理解的人的记忆所阻止。

He regained his footing, now determined now to see what exactly "Ayanami National Forest" was—he'd never heard of it before. He walked a measured distance away from the road at all times although at no point during his journey did a car ever go past. He was surprised there was even a station out here. Wherever "here" was.  
他重新站稳脚跟，现在决心要看看“绫波国家森林”究竟是什么——他以前从未听说过。他始终保持一定距离离开道路，尽管在整个旅程中从未有车辆经过。他很惊讶这里竟然有一个车站。无论“这里”是哪里。

After another fifteen minutes of walking, a good deal of it uphill, and Shinji saw the sign on his right along with a tiny tollbooth marking the entrance to the park. He looked around. The shocking stark green of Japanese forest in summer peak assaulted his eyes everywhere that he looked. Shinji approached the booth carefully, wary that this place might have some connection to NERV. Surprisingly enough no one was in the booth despite the gate across the road being lowered. He walked around the gate, pausing for a moment, and then continued down the road. Huge forest rose up on either side, towering green complexities that just eroded away the perspective in a cluster of trunks, leaves, and branches.  
再走了十五分钟，其中大部分都是上坡路，新吉看到右边的标志，以及一个小型收费亭标志着公园的入口。他四处张望。夏季日本森林的鲜绿色让他眼前一亮。新吉小心翼翼地走近亭子，担心这个地方可能与 NERV 有关。令人惊讶的是，尽管道路对面的大门被放下，但亭子里却没有人。他绕过大门，停顿了一会，然后继续沿着道路前行。两侧是高大的森林，翠绿的复杂枝叶在一簇树干、叶子和树枝中消失了视角。

When Shinji had reached the parking lot for what was apparently the park he noticed that there were no cars in the lot. No one appeared to be even remotely close to here it seemed. He moved through the empty parking lot up to another sign at the start of a trail into the woods.  
当新吉到达停车场时，发现停车场里没有车辆。似乎没有人靠近这里。他穿过空荡荡的停车场，走到通往树林的小径入口处的另一个标志。

The sign welcomed him to the park and informed him that he was witness to "Japan's newest national treasure." It was typical, he thought, of the government to go and do something like this and then not even tell anyone.  
标牌欢迎他来到公园，并告诉他他是目睹“日本最新的国家宝藏”的见证者。他觉得这很典型，政府做了这样的事情，然后甚至不告诉任何人。

At the bottom of the sign he noticed the line: "This park is dedicated to Rei Ayanami, Evangelion Pilot and hero. Her sacrifice made this world possible."  
在标牌底部，他注意到一行字：“这个公园是为了绫波零，EVA 驾驶员和英雄而建立的。她的牺牲使这个世界成为可能。”

_She had no choice! NO CHOICE!  
她别无选择！没有选择！_

Shinji lurched and bent over at the head of the trail, almost falling to his knees. Bile rushed at the back of his throat and he wretched though nothing came. This was exactly the sort of thing he'd been seeking to escape when he had run away this morning; praise for piloting Evangelion. Praise that he, most of all, did not deserve.  
新吉在小径的尽头踉跄着弯下腰，几乎跪倒在地上。恶心感袭上喉咙，他干呕着，但什么也没有吐出来。这正是他今早逃跑时想要摆脱的事情；对驾驶使徒的赞美。他最不应得到的赞美。

To him, at least, many of the things he'd done in Evangelion were inexcusable acts cowardice and worse. Names like Touji and Kaworu tended to walk into his head at times like these. And while the former was now free from the injuries endured during his piloting experience, the latter was very much gone—just as Rei was.  
至少对他来说，在使徒中做过的许多事情都是不可饶恕的懦弱行为，甚至更糟。像藤冢和渚这样的名字常常在这种时候闯入他的脑海。虽然前者现在已经摆脱了在驾驶过程中遭受的伤害，但后者早已离去——就像丽一样。

"I'm sorry, Rei," he murmured softly, righting himself and staring at the sign again.  
“对不起，丽。”他轻声喃喃，重新站直身体，再次凝视着那块标志牌。

He began to walk down the path into the forest.  
他开始沿着小路走进森林。

_Her forest. 她的森林。_

-

Asuka watched as Misato drove away, pulling around the corner. The school was more or less the same as the first school she'd been to in Tokyo-3, before the Impact. There were new students and new teachers, but her class was still the same class roughly.  
明日香看着美里开车离开，转过了拐角。学校和她在第三新东京的第一所学校基本上一样，冲击之前。有新的学生和新的老师，但她的班级基本上还是同一个班级。

She walked into the building and up the steps to the second floor where her classroom was. _Still A-2_, she thought, glancing at the big black letters as she walked over the precipice of the doorway. She carried two briefcases—hers and Shinji's. She wasn't entirely sure herself just why she'd brought his briefcase; she'd done it more on impulse than anything else.  
她走进大楼，走上楼梯来到她的教室所在的二楼。她仍然在 A-2 班，她想着，走过门口的悬崖时瞥了一眼那些大大的黑色字母。她提着两个公文包——一个是她的，一个是真司的。她自己也不太确定为什么会带真司的公文包；她这样做更多是出于冲动而非其他原因。

_Maybe,_ she reasoned, _when he arrives at school he'll notice I'm being nice to him._  
也许，她推理道，当他到学校时会注意到我对他很好。

Asuka grinned evilly, tossing Shinji's briefcase carelessly onto his empty desk.  
明日香邪恶地笑了笑，随意地把真司的公文包扔在他空着的桌子上。

Hikari trotted over, quickly recognizing Shinji's absence. Being the class leader that she was, she said, "Asuka, good morning. Is Shinji here today?"  
光快步走过去，迅速意识到真嗣不在。作为班长，她说：“明日香，早上好。真嗣今天在这里吗？”

She indicated at his empty seat as Asuka took hers next to Hikari.  
她指着他空着的座位，明日香坐在光旁边。

"Yeah, about that. The thing is, he ran away some time last night," she said idly, as if it wasn't of any real interest to her.  
“是的，关于那件事。事情是，他昨晚某个时候跑掉了，”她漫不经心地说道，好像对她来说并不是什么真正感兴趣的事情。

"What?" Hikari said, gasping and now staring wide-eyed at her friend.  
“什么？”光惊讶地说道，现在睁大眼睛看着她的朋友。

Touji and Kensuke, who'd been previously conspiring on some no-doubt stoogish thing, also turned their attention to her. They gathered next to Hikari, and Asuka grudgingly continued to explain.  
投次和健介，之前正在密谋某些毫无疑问是傻事的事情，也转而关注她。他们聚集在光旁边，明显不情愿地继续解释。

"Yeah. Misato has Section Two looking for him but, knowing those idiots, he could be gone for a while. Maybe even a few days... baka."  
“是的。美里让二部去找他，但是知道那些白痴，他可能会消失一段时间。甚至可能几天... 馬鹿。”

"Gee," Hikari intoned. "Do you think it's cause of the ceremony today?"  
“天啊，”光轻声说道。“你觉得是因为今天的仪式吗？”

"Probably," Asuka muttered into the collar of her shirt.  
“可能吧，”明日香嘟囔着说到，声音传入她衬衫的领口里。

Touji and Kensuke just stared at the pair of females, equally bewildered. Touji, being the less intelligent of the two, opened his mouth first.  
刀二和健介只是呆呆地盯着这对女性，同样感到困惑。两人中较笨的刀二率先开口。

"He ran away _because_ of the ceremony? I don't get it. They are going to be applauding us today, I thought."  
"他因为仪式而逃跑？我不明白。今天他们会为我们鼓掌，我以为。"

"You would completely miss the point, stooge," Asuka replied, eyes narrowing. "You're a stooge; you don't understand things like this." The way she said it sounded as if she was explaining to a child. "Shinji doesn't like talking about—even thinking about piloting Evangelion. That's just how he is. You remember what he was like meeting you again for the first time since... you piloted."  
"你完全不懂重点，白痴，"明日香回答道，眼睛眯起。"你是个白痴；你不懂这种事。"她说话的语气听起来像是在给一个孩子解释。"新吉不喜欢谈论——甚至想到驾驶使徒。他就是这样。你还记得他第一次见到你时的样子，自从...你驾驶过。"

Touji nodded hesitantly, briefly lost in the memories of that awkward but happy reunion. Kensuke just sort of turned his gaze to each one of them, seeming to be the only one still out the loop.  
藤吉犹豫地点了点头，短暂地陷入那次尴尬但快乐的重逢的回忆中。健介只是把目光转向他们每一个人，似乎是唯一一个还不知情的人。

"Wait, what? Shinji isn't coming today?" Kensuke said, finally.  
“等等，什么？今天不来真司吗？”肯助最终说道。

"Gah! Idiots! I can't stand talking to these chumps; I don't know how Shinji puts up with them," Asuka said, suddenly pretending as if only Hikari existed again.  
“该死！这些白痴！我受不了和这些笨蛋说话；我不知道真司是怎么忍受他们的，”明日香突然说道，假装只有日下部存在。

A tiny gesture passed between Hikari and Touji; not much more than a look. The boys, realizing they were being excluded again, slowly retreated to their seats. Each one looked thoroughly more confused than before they had joined the conversation.  
日下部和刀二之间传递了一个微小的手势；不过是一瞥而已。男孩们意识到他们再次被排除在外，慢慢地退回到他们的座位。每个人看起来比加入对话之前更加困惑。

Hikari, in the meantime, had been assimilating all of this information about Shinji.  
而在此期间，光一直在吸收有关真嗣的所有信息。

"So he really did run away because of the ceremony. Oh, I hope he's alright Asuka..." she said, sounding far more worried than Asuka appeared to be.  
“所以他真的是因为仪式才逃跑的。哦，希望明日香没事…” 她说道，听起来比明日香看起来更担心。

"Nonsense. I'm sure he'll be fine. He's just running away, Hikari—he's done it plenty of times before."  
“胡说八道。我相信他会没事的。他只是在逃避，光，他以前做过很多次了。”

"I know, Asuka. But still, Shinji hasn't been... well, you know, he hasn't been himself I guess. I worry about him now. Have you talked to him lately? I mean, he seems really... depressed."  
“我知道，明日香。但是，真的，新吉最近一直都不太对劲……你知道的，他好像变了个人似的。我现在有点担心他。你最近和他说过话吗？我是说，他看起来真的……很沮丧。”

Asuka shook her head growing quiet.  
明日香摇了摇头，变得安静起来。

_Everyone I know... they're all turning into dolls. That's what she's saying. She sees it too. Is he becoming just another doll like Rei? Is that what all Eva Pilots become?  
“我认识的每个人……他们都在变成娃娃。她就是这么说的。她也看到了。他会像零号一样变成另一个娃娃吗？难道所有的 EVA 驾驶员都会变成这样吗？”_

_Is that what I'm becoming?  
我正在变成那样吗？_

The last thought was almost too much, too frightening. Asuka trembled under her friends gaze lost in the horrifying sense of it. Hikari put her hand to Asuka's shoulder, knocking her out of her trance.  
最后的想法几乎太多了，太可怕了。明日香在朋友的凝视下颤抖着，陷入了可怕的感觉中。日香把手放在明日香的肩膀上，把她从恍惚中唤醒。

"You okay?" she said, staring into Asuka's twin blues which held something unusual in their expression now.  
“你没事吧？”她说着，凝视着明日香的双蓝眼睛，眼中现在有些不同寻常的表情。

"Yeah," Asuka said after a moment.  
“是的，”明日香过了一会儿说。

She tried to concentrate now, pushing the thoughts away. She remembered her mission for the day.  
她试图集中注意力，把思绪赶走。她记得自己今天的任务。

_Maybe, though... maybe if I can get revenge on Shinji I can break him. Robots don't cry—they certainly can't be jealous.  
也许，不过...也许如果我能报复真司的话，我就能击垮他。机器人不会哭泣——它们肯定不会嫉妒。_

She focused her gaze on Takeshi Fukai, a transfer student, from where she couldn't remember. She didn't know much about him except that all the girls in the school had fawned over him ever since his arrival. His "handsome" features won him more attention than even she or Shinji were treated, something that had prompted her to despise his presence.  
她把目光集中在福井武士身上，一个她记不起来从哪里转学来的学生。她对他了解不多，只知道自从他来到学校以后，所有女生都对他倾慕不已。他“英俊”的外表赢得了比她和真嗣还要多的关注，这让她开始厌恶他的存在。

He was also second on the basket ball team only to Touji Suzuhara; those two had an uneasy friendship made uncomfortable by the basketball rivalry and Fukai's contempt for Shinji. Fukai, apparently had lost someone in Third Impact. An Unreturned, as they were called now.  
他也是篮球队里排名第二的，仅次于铃原刀二；这两人之间有一种不舒服的友谊，由篮球比赛的竞争和福井对真嗣的蔑视使之更加尴尬。福井显然在第三次冲击中失去了某人。现在他们被称为“未归者”。

From what Asuka had seen, during the few social encounters between the two boys, things were tense to put it nicely.  
从阿斯卡所见，在两个男孩之间的少数社交接触中，情况可以说是紧张的。

She took a few confident strides across the room to his desk, leaving Hikari for the moment to contemplate Shinji's running away.  
她在房间里自信地走了几步到他的桌子前，暂时把光留给了思考真嗣逃跑的时刻。

She paused by his desk, waiting for him to finish speaking to two girls who were flirting with him in a manner that could best be described as "hopelessly obvious."  
她在他的桌子旁停下来，等着他结束与两个女孩的谈话，她们正以一种“毫无希望地明显”的方式与他调情。

"Hello, Takeshi," she said sweetly, eyeing him.  
“你好，武士，”她甜甜地说着，眼睛盯着他。

She realized now why so many girls flocked to him. He had a pretty, confident face and a strong, tall frame. He was easily an inch or two taller than her which was saying something given her German ancestry.  
她现在明白为什么那么多女孩会涌向他。他有一张漂亮、自信的脸庞和强壮、高大的身材。他比她高了一两英寸，考虑到她的德国血统，这可不是一件小事。

He blinked slowly, flashing his dark eyelashes in a gesture that could be described as something faintly reptilian.  
他慢慢眨眼，闪烁着他那深邃的睫毛，这个动作可以被描述为略带爬行动物的特征。

"Hello... Asuka," he said, after a moment's pause. She was almost surprised that he knew her name by the tone he used. Then again, she and Shinji were probably the only two high school students known just about everywhere they went in Tokyo-2. Or anywhere else in the world for that matter.  
“你好...明日香，”他说道，停顿片刻后。她几乎惊讶于他用的语气竟然知道她的名字。不过，她和真嗣可能是东京-2 几乎所有地方都知道的两个高中生。或者说，在世界上任何地方都是如此。

"So," she said, not wasting time. "Have you heard about how I'm going to be in the ceremony today? Pretty cool, huh? Yeah, I'm the only available Eva Pilot in the school. Well, other than Shinji I guess."  
“那么，”她说，毫不拖泥带水。“你听说我今天要参加典礼了吗？挺酷的，对吧？是啊，我是学校唯一可用的 Eva 驾驶员。嗯，除了真司以外吧。”

"Ikari..." He said the name like a poison.  
“碇……”他说这个名字就像在说毒药。

"Yeah?" she said. “是吗？”她说。

"Where is he today?" he asked, looking around the classroom as if he hadn't spotted him yet. "Doesn't he usually come in with you?"  
“他今天在哪里？”他问道，环顾教室，仿佛还没有看到他一样。“他通常不是跟你一起进来的吗？”

"Yeah," she said, rolling her eyes. "He's uhh, sick... yeah, I think he's getting taken to the doctor right now actually."  
“是的，”她说着，翻着白眼。“他，呃，生病了… 是的，我想他现在应该被带去看医生了。”

He laughed, flashing flawless teeth. His grin turned into an ugly sneer. "So he really _is_ a wimp, like they say?"  
他笑了，露出完美的牙齿。他的笑容变成了一个丑陋的冷笑。“所以他真的像他们说的那样是个懦夫？”

_Only I get to say that about Ikari!  
只有我才能这样说碇！_

She resisted the urge to smack him—an urge she also found faintly disturbing—and faked a surprisingly convincing grin, pretending to smile at his joke.  
她忍住了想要打他的冲动——她发现这种冲动有点让人不安——假装露出了一个出奇地令人信服的笑容，假装对他的笑话微笑。

"Say, you're pretty cute," he said, his gaze lowering itself down her body. She watched him eye her hungrily, half-disgusted and half-delighted at how easily he had been attracted to her. _Stupid boys... hahaha._  
“你知道吗，你挺可爱的，”他说着，目光往下移动到她的身体。她看着他贪婪地盯着自己，一半感到恶心，一半感到高兴，他对她如此容易产生吸引力。愚蠢的男孩们...哈哈哈。

"Why don't we talk more often?" he said quietly.  
“我们为什么不经常聊天呢？”他轻声说道。

"I don't know," she giggled. "Maybe you should come ask me some time. Oh look at that—there's our professor. Maybe I'll see you after class..."  
“我不知道，”她咯咯笑道。“也许你应该过来问问我。哦，看那边—我们的教授来了。也许下课后我会见到你…”

She gave him one last smile and returned to her seat, plopping down. Her demeanor could be described as almost giddy. But then Asuka and giddy didn't usually tend to mix very well. The teacher began to write up something on the board after the "stand, bow, sit" routine. Asuka just smiled to herself, clasping her hands over her desk.  
她最后微笑一下，回到座位上，扑通一声坐下。她的态度可以说是近乎兴奋。但是明日香和兴奋通常不太搭配。老师在“站立、鞠躬、坐下”的程序后开始在黑板上写些东西。明日香只是对着自己微笑，双手交叉放在桌子上。

_Everything is going according to plan.  
一切都按计划进行。_

The forest loomed up on either side of him, engulfing his view in every direction. Pines towered, oaks flowered, and underbrush seemed thriving as well. Shinji thought that he had spotted at least three kinds of plant he hadn't ever seen in Japan before; plants he had never seen at all.  
森林在他两侧高耸，四面八方都被吞没在其中。松树耸立，橡树开花，灌木丛也茂盛着。新司觉得他至少看到了三种他以前从未在日本见过的植物；甚至是他从未见过的植物。

Birds called out to one another, their cries all collecting into a massive symphonic chatter; it was beautiful and unending. Shinji had never recalled visiting such a naturally beautiful place ever before. It made him smile then, the second time he'd done so today, walking down the winding path further and further into the forest.  
鸟儿互相呼唤，它们的叫声汇集成一场庞大的交响音乐会；美丽而无尽。新司从未记得曾经去过如此自然美丽的地方。这让他微笑，这是他今天第二次微笑，一步步走进森林的蜿蜒小径。

_At least she has a beautiful place named after her. I think Rei would have liked it here. Yeah, maybe.  
至少她有一个以她命名的美丽地方。我想 Rei 会喜欢这里的。是的，也许。_

As he continued into the forest all of the traces of Tokyo-2's pinnacle markers, the skyscrapers, were slowly edged out by a canopy of leaves and pines reaching ever higher. Shinji continued trotting down the brown earth path, his head arched up so he could take in every piece of scenery. He felt pleased at his discovery and now earnestly wanted to spend the rest of the day out in this park.  
当他继续走进森林时，东京-2 的标志性建筑，摩天大楼的痕迹逐渐被树叶和松树不断升高的树冠所取代。新吉继续沿着褐色土路小跑，仰起头来，以便欣赏每一处风景。他对自己的发现感到满意，现在真诚地希望能在这个公园里度过余下的一天。

But just as he was really beginning to enjoy the unending twists and turns of the canopy of leaves the trees stopped, making a clearing. It looked to be no bigger than fifty meters wide, but it was easily big enough to conceal something in the tall green grass that flourished at the center of it. Sure enough, as Shinji edged his way into the center, he noticed something forming in between the edges of the tall grass. Something dark. _Water?_  
但就在他真正开始享受树冠无尽的曲折时，树木停止了，露出了一个空地。这个空地看起来不超过五十米宽，但足够大，可以隐藏在中心蓬勃生长的高绿草之间的某物。果然，当新吉缓缓走向中心时，他注意到在高草的边缘之间形成了某物。一些黑暗的东西。水？

It was a huge pool, perfectly circular and perfectly blue, almost a reflection of the cloudless sky above. Shinji just stared at it a moment, trying to make sense out of it. There was something, he could see it faintly; something that didn't look right with it. Something about the way that the surface was moving that made him shiver—made his skin crawl.  
这是一个巨大的泳池，完美地圆形和完美地蓝色，几乎是对上方晴空的一种反射。新吉只是盯着它看了一会儿，试图弄清楚其中的意义。有些东西，他隐约能看到；有些东西看起来不对劲。水面的运动方式让他感到不舒服，让他的皮肤发麻。

_That doesn't look... right.  
看起来... 不对劲。_

He approached it hesitantly and carefully pushed his way through the grass up to his waist. Once he was through the ring of grass he could clearly see the entire pool, easily half the size of the clearing itself. The first thing he noticed was that none of the tall grass around the opposite edge of the pool was being reflected on the surface of the water. The effect was subtle but bizarre. Furthermore, he could see nothing beneath the surface itself. No sign of a bottom at all. The surface kept moving, bulging, shifting around in ways liquid wasn't supposed to move. Something about the liquid suddenly didn't seem quite so real, as if he had just stumbled into a dream.  
他犹豫地走近，小心翼翼地穿过草地，直到水没过他的腰。一旦他穿过草地环，他可以清楚地看到整个泳池，几乎有清场本身一半那么大。他首先注意到的是，水池对面边缘周围的高草没有在水面上反射出来。这种效果微妙但古怪。此外，他在水面下看不到任何东西。根本看不到底部的迹象。水面不断移动，鼓起，以液体不应该移动的方式变化。突然间，液体的某些地方似乎不那么真实，仿佛他刚刚闯入了一个梦境。

He bent down, looking into the pool. After a moment's pause he tried reaching into it, letting his curiosity get the best of him. It was as if his hand was running into invisible ice just before the water began; ice that had no temperature, no sensation of texture whatsoever. Ice that had no friction. He realized the "feelingless" sensation then.  
他弯下腰，凝视着水池。停顿片刻后，他试图伸手进去，让好奇心占了上风。就好像他的手在水开始之前碰到了无形的冰块；一种没有温度、没有质地感觉的冰块。一种没有摩擦力的冰块。他意识到了那种“无感觉”的感觉。

_AT Field—ANGEL! A.T.场—使徒！_

He recoiled, pulling his hand away and staring at the shifting blue hues of the pool now in terror. He vaguely realized that the constant chatter of the bird calls, their beautiful song that had cried out since he had entered the woods, had ended—the entire forest had grown deathly silent. Then it seemed he couldn't remember anything else.  
他退缩了，把手缩了回来，恐惧地盯着水池中变幻的蓝色。他隐约意识到，自从他进入树林以来，一直响彻着的鸟鸣声，它们美妙的歌声已经停止了——整个森林变得死一般的寂静。然后，他似乎什么都记不起来了。

A/N: The lyrics at the beginning are from the Nine Inch Nails song "And All That Could Have Been." All three parts have been written for this story (although it could be admittedly much, much longer) and I am currently only revising them. This was just a quick little idea I wrote up before I even started working on "A Thousand Years of Secrecy." I'm sure it's derivative. I'm sure it's been done a million times before. But I don't care. It's mine and I love it.  
作者注：开头的歌词出自 Nine Inch Nails 的歌曲“And All That Could Have Been”。这个故事的所有三部分都是为这个故事写的（尽管可以承认它可能会长得多得多），我目前只是在修改它们。这只是我在甚至开始着手“千年的秘密”之前写的一个快速小想法。我确定这是衍生的。我确定这已经被做过无数次了。但我不在乎。这是我的，我爱它。

### Chapter 2 Easy Mistakes/How to Fall Down

_"I will find a center in you / I will chew it up and leave  
我会在你身上找到一个中心 / 我会将其咀嚼并离开_

_I will work to elevate you / Just enough to bring you down"  
我会努力提升你 / 只够让你失望_

---
Asuka sighed when she saw him come walking in, half-relieved and half-annoyed. It was the middle of their third subject for the day, just one away from lunch. And then, right in the middle of the lecture, in comes one slumping Shinji Ikari accompanied by a flustered Misato—of course. The teacher paused to speak with her in hushed tones while the class just stared as the ever-awkward Shinji took his seat.  
明日香看到他走进来时叹了口气，一半是松了口气，一半是恼火。这是他们今天第三节课的中间，离午餐只有一节课了。然后，在讲课的中途，一个低头的碇真嗣和一个慌乱的美里走了进来——当然。老师停下来和她低声交谈，而全班同学则盯着这个总是尴尬的真嗣坐下。

After their guardian had finished speaking to the professor she turned, looking to Shinji and then to Asuka before disappearing out the door and probably back to NERV to really start kicking the asses of Section Two.  
监护人和教授交谈结束后，她转身看了看真嗣，然后看了看明日香，然后消失在门外，可能回 NERV 去真正开始踢第二部门的屁股。

Asuka looked over at Shinji while pretending to distract herself with something outside the classroom windows; just the way she would always do when watching him in class. He was his usual blank self, a little tired perhaps, but seeming almost the same. She felt disgusted with him suddenly, sneering at his attitude.  
明日香看着真嗣，假装在教室窗外分散注意力；她总是这样在课堂上看着他。他还是那个一贯的木讷自己，或许有点疲倦，但看起来几乎没变。她突然感到厌恶，对他的态度嗤之以鼻。

_Why'd you even run away if you were going to let yourself get caught so easily? Unless you really need the pity that bad... Pathetic.  
你要是这么容易就被抓到，为什么要逃跑呢？除非你真的那么需要怜悯… 可悲。_

"Feh," she released under her breath, blowing off the anger for the time being.  
“呸，"她低声嘀咕着，暂时压下了愤怒。

If Shinji noticed her irritation with him he did nothing to show it. In fact he didn't even return Touji's whispers to him or Kensuke's inquiries into Section Two methods of subject-recovery; instead he just sat, eyes forward, staring out into nothing; he seemed to be oblivious to everything going on in class.  
如果真崎注意到她对他的恼怒，他没有表现出来。事实上，他甚至没有回应藤二对他的耳语，或者肯助对第二部门主体恢复方法的询问；相反，他只是坐在那里，眼睛朝前，凝视着虚空；他似乎对课堂上发生的一切都视而不见。

His disconnection only irritated her further. This was Shinji's problem nowadays, she thought—he was too cut off from everyone else, even his supposed friends. Whether it was self-inflicted or not, Asuka was determined to break his increasingly Rei-like attitude one way or another. Today, she reasoned, she had finally found that "another."  
"他的疏远只让她更加恼火。她想，这是新吉现在的问题——他与其他人的联系太少了，甚至是他所谓的朋友。明知是自作自受还是别有原因，明日香决心要以某种方式打破他越来越像零的态度。她理智地认为，今天她终于找到了那个“某种方式”。”

She continued to analyze him, trying to read his still body. She could tell he had noticed by now his briefcase was at his desk. She wondered if he would remember to thank her for bringing it. A part of her was angry just at the possibility he might not but, knowing Shinji as she thought she did, she was sure he would find a way to thank her if only for the opportunity to speak to her.  
她继续分析他，试图读懂他静止的身体。她可以看出他现在已经注意到了他的公文包在他的桌子上。她想知道他是否会记得感谢她带来它。她内心的一部分对他可能不会记得感到愤怒，但她认为她了解新吉，她确信他会找到一种方式来感谢她，即使只是为了有机会和她说话。

He had always been so easy to predict before anyways, she pondered, watching him now out of the corner of her eye.  
她想，他以前总是那么容易预测，现在也是，她斜眼看着他。

He stood up, nearly jolting her out of her seat as she looked away, and when the teacher ahemed at him he said, "I'm going bathroom."  
他站起来，几乎把她从座位上惊得不知所措，当老师对他咳嗽时，他说：“我去洗手间。”

He didn't even ask. He just said it and then walked out. Hikari had practically jumped out of her seat to stop him but a friend near by (a friend Asuka quietly cursed now) reminded the class leader that Shinji was "probably sick today" and Hikari's boiling fury was ended prematurely. The teacher just stared out after the boy's exit, slightly put-off but far too surprised to do anything. No one in the class, teacher included, had ever seen Shinji be rude like that before—even Asuka was a bit surprised. After a moment the lecture continued as though nothing was amiss.  
他甚至没有问，只是说完就走了。光井几乎跳起来要阻止他，但旁边的一个朋友（明日香悄悄诅咒的朋友）提醒班长说真嗣“可能今天生病了”，光井的愤怒被提前结束了。老师只是盯着男孩离开的方向，有点不悦，但太惊讶了，什么也没做。班里没人，包括老师在内，以前见过真嗣如此无礼的样子—甚至明日香也有点吃惊。片刻之后，讲课继续，仿佛一切都没有问题。

She thought she could faintly hear Fukai's throaty chuckle from behind her right shoulder.  
她觉得自己能听到福井在她右肩后面发出的低沉笑声。

-

Shinji hovered over the toilet bowl, paused, and then threw up again. There wasn't any breakfast in his stomach to be purged so clear, foul-smelling bile came out instead. He shook off the nausea, or maybe it shook him, he couldn't tell. The world seemed startlingly... unfamiliar. He tried to remember waking up today.  
新吉弯腰在马桶上，停顿了一下，然后又呕吐了。他的胃里并没有任何早餐需要排出，所以排出的是清澈、恶臭的胆汁。他摆脱了恶心，或者说是恶心摆脱了他，他分不清楚。世界似乎变得令人震惊地陌生。他试图回忆起今天早上醒来的情景。

He had been running away. He had gotten on the train and then... he was in Misato's back seat. And what had she been telling him? Relax? Relaxing seemed absurdly impossible. He was nervous, hands practically shaking off the edge of the sink. One moment it was the sharp edges on the soap dispenser, the next it was tidal waves. Nothing seemed to be in order in his head. The dizziness didn't disappear even after the contents of his stomach seemed to stop rebelling.  
他一直在逃避。他上了火车，然后...他坐在美里的后座上。她告诉过他什么？放松？放松似乎荒谬地不可能。他紧张，手几乎颤抖到了洗手池的边缘。一会儿是肥皂液体分配器的锋利边缘，下一秒是海啸。他脑海中似乎一团糟。即使胃里的内容似乎停止了反抗，头晕的感觉仍未消失。

He turned and looked at himself in the mirror. He stared at his reflection gaping in incomprehension; everything except him seemed to be moving on the reflection, swimming around him in a mess of swirls. The stalls in the bathroom, the lights in the ceiling and the tiles on the floor. It was all dancing into each other, rearranging itself at random, dividing and recombining like some giant kaleidoscope, constantly in motion, and all the while he remained frozen in the middle of it: the only thing still and complete.  
他转过身，看着镜子里的自己。他凝视着自己的倒影，茫然不解；除了他自己，似乎一切都在倒影中移动，围绕着他在一团漩涡中游动。浴室里的隔间，天花板上的灯光和地板上的瓷砖。一切都在彼此舞动，随机重新排列，分裂和重组，就像一个巨大的万花筒，不断运动，而他却一直凝固在其中央：唯一静止而完整的事物。

He couldn't look at it any longer. He looked back into the sink, and turned on the water. He splashed it over his face again and again. _This is real_, he said. _This is real._  
他无法再看下去。他转回头看向水槽，打开水龙头。他一遍又一遍地往脸上泼水。这是真实的，他说。这是真实的。

Or did he think it? He wasn't sure. Something about the water going into the drain in the sink, twirling into nothing; it looked so familiar—then abruptly terrifying to look at anymore and he screamed genuinely, turning away. He collapsed into a stall and put his head into his hands, shaking uncontrollably, as tears he did not understand came spilling out.  
或者他只是这么想？他不确定。水流进水槽，旋转消失的样子，看起来如此熟悉——然后突然间变得令人恐惧，不敢再看，他真实地尖叫着，转身离开。他倒在一个隔间里，抱着头，不受控制地颤抖，眼泪涌出却不明所以。

_Something's wrong with me_, he kept thinking over and over.  
他一遍又一遍地想着，我出了什么问题。

-

Lunch went by almost as quickly as the first four classes had, despite the introduction of Ikari into the picture. Asuka had eaten a quick, bland bento made for her by Misato on short notice that morning; she was sitting in her usual spot, by herself other than Hikari. Touji and Kensuke eventually joined them in mid-meal as was the irritating habit of her new boyfriend but, Shinji was nowhere to be found. When Asuka inquired to Touji about his absence both boys only shrugged at each other.  
尽管伊卡里的出现，午餐的时间几乎和前四节课一样快速地过去了。明早米莎托匆忙为明日制作了一份简单乏味的便当给明日吃；她照常坐在她的位置上，除了光辉。东寺和健介最终在用餐中段加入了她们，这是她新男友令人讨厌的习惯，但是，新吉却不见了。当明日询问东寺关于新吉的缺席时，两个男孩只是相互耸了耸肩。

"Shinji said he wasn't eating today," they replied in unison.  
“新吉说他今天不吃饭，”他们异口同声地回答。

Asuka put down her chopsticks slowly, carefully; she had lost her appetite. Enough is enough. She was tired of the act Shinji was putting on today. First running away, now acting strange in school—he was just asking for trouble from her. She hated whenever Shinji was in one of his "oh, the world is against me, boo hoo" moods and today that side of him had been on display in full.  
明日香慢慢地放下筷子，她已经没胃口了。已经够了。她受够了今天真嗣的表演。先是逃跑，现在在学校里表现得古怪——他简直是在招惹她惹麻烦。她讨厌真嗣陷入那种“哦，世界都对不起我，呜呜”情绪的时候，而今天他展现出了他的这一面。

_It's probably all an act_, she thought angrily. _Just to try and get my attention._  
她愤怒地想，这可能都是一场表演。只是为了引起我的注意。

Well, she concluded, now he did have her attention only this time she was not going to let his attitude get to her. This time he was going to get what he deserved, a heavy dose of reality. Asuka could not be manipulated. She would prove that to him. She would make Shinji envious of her. She would make him jealous. If felt good after all, she reasoned. Yes, it could feel nice to be wanted by someone.  
她得出结论说，现在他确实引起了她的注意，但这一次她不会让他的态度影响自己。这一次他将得到他应得的，一剂沉重的现实。明日香不会被操纵。她会向他证明这一点。她会让真嗣羡慕她。她会让他嫉妒。毕竟，她理智地认为，被某人渴望是一种美好的感觉。

_Today, I'll make him want me again.  
今天，我要让他再次想要我。_

As soon as lunch period had ended the principal came onto the PA informing all of the students that they were to enter the auditorium for the ceremony today.  
午餐时间一结束，校长就通过广播通知所有学生，今天他们要进入礼堂参加仪式。

Students filed out of the cafeteria, laughing and talking to one another and eager to take the time they were getting out of class to socialize. School tended to be pretty time-consuming if one actually paid attention in class, something she considered as beneath her with a college degree already completed.  
学生们走出餐厅，互相笑谈，渴望利用课间时间社交。如果一个人在课堂上认真听讲，学校会占用相当多的时间，而她认为这是低人一等的事情，毕竟她已经完成了大学学位。

Her schooling had been accelerated so far in Germany that by the time she had arrived in Japan the only struggle in any given subject was figuring out all of the Kanji on the page (a struggle that had earned her some particularly low marks when she had first arrived). This had helped foster her slacker attitude. Shinji, on the other hand, was always the studious one if not the brightest bulb on the Christmas tree. Used to be studious, she reminded herself—ever since Third Impact that side of him had disappeared. She had heard only snippets of his teacher-parent conferences this year from Misato: apparently Shinji hadn't turned in a single assignment yet. All his tests had been returned to the teacher blank.  
她在德国的学业进展迅速，以至于当她抵达日本时，在任何学科中唯一的挑战就是弄清楚页面上的所有汉字（这一挑战在她刚到达时曾让她得到一些特别低的分数）。这帮助培养了她的懒散态度。另一方面，新吉一直是用功的一个，即使不是最聪明的那盏圣诞树上的灯泡。她提醒自己，他曾经是用功的——自第三次冲击以来，他的这一面就消失了。她今年只从美里听到了他的一些家长会议的片段：显然，新吉还没有交过一份作业。他所有的考试都是空白地退回给老师的。

Asuka forced herself to stop thinking about him and trudged into the auditorium, Hikari quietly in tow the entire time. They separated with a few parting words as they entered and Asuka went to sit at the front of the auditorium, right next to Touji as she had been instructed previously. No one else but he occupied the front row. Beside her a chair with a piece of paper marked "Ikari" remained conspicuously empty. She looked around but he did not appear to be anywhere, particularly near here.  
明日香强迫自己不再想着他，跋涉进礼堂，希香默默地跟在她身后。他们在进入时分别说了几句话，明日香按照之前的指示坐在礼堂前排，就在投次旁边。前排只有他一个人。她旁边有一把椅子上面放着一个写着“碇”的纸条，显眼地空着。她四处看了看，但他似乎不在附近，尤其是在这里。

_Shit. Is he really going to make me and Touji do this by ourselves? Even after he got brought here by Misato like that? He wouldn't... would he?  
该死。他真的要让我和投次自己做这件事吗？即使他像那样被美里带到这里？他不会吧..._

She didn't entirely know what "this" was as she thought about it now, looking over at the equally-bewildered Touji. All her teacher had instructed them to do after class had ended yesterday was to sit in the front row and stand up when called upon.  
她现在并不完全知道“这件事”是什么，她看着同样困惑的投次。昨天下课后，她的老师只是告诉他们坐在前排，等被叫到时站起来。

More and more students continued to pour in, filling up the seats behind her higher and higher into the room. Even many of the faculty was attending, squeezed into seats on the end of the row or standing off to the side in the aisles next to either wall of the room.  
越来越多的学生继续涌入，把座位填满，高高地堆到房间里。甚至许多教职员工也在场，挤在排的末端座位上，或站在房间两侧的过道旁。

The principal, who was standing in front of the entire room just beneath the stage, stared at Asuka now. The students had finished coming in. The presentation was due to start. A quiet hush began to grow over the room. The hard-looking man, slightly bald, stared down at Asuka over the rims of his glasses and gestured vaguely at the empty seat next to her.  
校长站在舞台下整个房间前，此刻盯着明日香。学生们已经进来了。演讲即将开始。房间里开始逐渐安静下来。这位看起来严厉的、略显秃头的男人透过眼镜边缘凝视着明日香，模糊地指向她旁边的空座位。

Asuka just shrugged in response, feeling the blood rush to her cheeks.  
明日香只是耸了耸肩，感觉脸颊泛起红潮。

_Now you've got the principal mad at you too, dummkopf.  
现在校长也生你的气了，蠢货。_

Reluctantly after a few minutes wait, the principal sighed and nodded to the eager projectionist who Asuka now realized was none other than Kensuke Aida. Asuka looked between him and the principal then did a double-take. She had no idea her classmate was "in on it." Kensuke just grinned maniacally in response and gave her a thumbs-up.  
经过几分钟的犹豫，校长叹了口气，向急切的放映员点了点头，让明日香意识到他竟然是肯助相。明日香看着他和校长之间来回看了两次。她完全不知道她的同学也参与其中。肯助只是狞笑着回应，并向她竖起了大拇指。

Then the lights in the auditorium dimmed, and onto the screen projected the huge image of Unit 01 and 02 rising up out of a mountainside at sunset, a shot from the beginning of one of their missions against one of the Angels, she knew. The crowd of students made sounds of excitement and awe, watching the towering machines of war began to stomp out into the countryside with their thunderous footsteps shaking the speakers of the entire room.  
然后礼堂里的灯光变暗了，屏幕上投影出 01 号和 02 号单位在日落时分从山腰上升起的巨大画面，她知道这是她们对抗天使之一的任务开始时的镜头。学生们发出兴奋和敬畏的声音，看着这些战争机器巨大的身影开始踏出乡间，他们的震耳欲聋的脚步声震动着整个房间的扬声器。

The Evangelions, she remarked, from this perspective looked awesomely powerful. It was almost hard to believe, she thought as the footage slowly intensified, that she had once powered one of those; it seemed like another world to her now. Some sort of classical music was tinkling in the background behind the raw noise their machines could make by simply moving.  
她评论说，从这个角度看，使徒们看起来令人敬畏地强大。她觉得几乎难以置信，当录像慢慢加强时，她曾经驾驶过其中一个；现在对她来说，这似乎是另一个世界。背景中响起了某种古典音乐，掩盖了他们的机器只要移动就能发出的原始噪音。

She noticed then, out of the corner of her eye, one Shinji Ikari ducking his way towards the front. He took his seat beside her without even making eye contact, silently fitting into place like he always had. She would have berated him if the principal hadn't been right there. But then she realized that she should try to be nice to him, if only for a little bit longer. No need to ruin the surprise. The video continued as though nothing had happened though she noticed the principal breathe a tiny sigh of relief.  
她注意到，角落里有一个名叫碇真司的人朝前走去。他坐在她旁边，甚至没有眼神接触，默默地像往常一样找到了自己的位置。如果校长不在场，她本来会训斥他的。但后来她意识到，她应该试着对他好一点，哪怕只是稍微。没必要提前泄露惊喜。视频继续播放，好像什么都没发生过，尽管她注意到校长轻轻地松了口气。

The footage of the Evas began to be interspersed with footage of all of the incredible ground-level work being done by all of the NERV crews just in preparation for each battle. Hordes of equipment trucks, security vehicles, and communications teams moving into place and setting up. The violins came in mournful and melodic and, the music began to take a darker edge.  
EVA 的录影开始与 NERV 所有工作人员为每次战斗做的令人难以置信的地面工作的录影交替出现。大量的设备卡车、安保车辆和通讯团队陆续抵达并展开工作。小提琴哀伤而旋律优美，音乐开始变得更加阴暗。

The previously noisy crowd of the room began to quiet down; they watched intensely as images of the damage from battles were projected onto the screen with the darker minor tone of the melody. Entire blocks of Tokyo-3 wiped out; mountainsides demolished; lakes appearing in places that they hadn't been before.  
原本喧闹的房间里的人群开始安静下来；他们专注地观看着战斗造成的破坏影像在屏幕上投影出来，伴随着更加阴暗的旋律。整个东京-3 的街区被夷为平地；山坡被摧毁；湖泊出现在之前从未有过的地方。

One by one a handful of Angels was projected onto the screen as the music grew darker and darker. The crowd made murmurs of agitation and some even went so far as to boo at the alien looking creatures. That got a grin from Touji in the corner of her eye.  
一只只天使被投影到屏幕上，音乐变得越来越阴暗。人群开始发出不满的低语，甚至有些人对着那些外表奇异的生物发出嘘声。这让角地的投次眼角含笑。

Suddenly, brilliantly, as the trumpets came in again, the Evangelions crashed back onto the screen, entering into combat with the various Angels.  
突然，当号角再次响起时，使徒们辉煌地再次出现在屏幕上，与各种天使展开战斗。

Asuka remarked silently that, despite her previous cynicism, it was a well put together presentation. When the music began to drain away images of the Evangelions re-entering the Geofront flashed across the screen and finally the music ended and the lights turned back on again.  
明日香默默地评论说，尽管她先前持怀疑态度，但这是一个精心策划的展示。当音乐开始消失时，使徒重新进入地下指挥中枢的画面在屏幕上闪现，最终音乐结束，灯光重新亮起。

The crowd made thunderous applause, from which Kensuke seemed to particularly swell in pride. His smile was practically lighting up the entire auditorium as the students cheered. She then had the sneaking suspicion that he had been involved in the creation of the presentation as well.  
人群发出雷鸣般的掌声，其中肯助似乎特别自豪。他的微笑几乎照亮了整个礼堂，学生们欢呼雀跃。她突然怀疑他也参与了展示的制作。

The principal walked onto the stage and up to the podium and the applause ended after a few more moments and his call for attention.  
校长走上舞台，走向讲台，掌声在几个瞬间后结束，他呼吁大家静下来。

"I would just like to congratulate our three attending pilots again for their bravery one year ago that made this world possible. Shinji, Asuka, Touji, please stand. Let's all give them another round of applause!"  
“我想再次祝贺我们去年那三位勇敢的飞行员，正是他们的勇气让这个世界成为可能。Shinji，Asuka，Touji，请站起来。让我们再次为他们鼓掌！”

Slowly, they rose together. It was almost camaraderie. For a few moments as they began to stand, it almost appeared as if the pilots might have been close to one another because of their experience in Evangelion. No one knew how Shinji had crippled Touji. No one knew how close they'd all come to dying. No one knew about her mental break down. _No one really knows what a fucking coward he is._ How confusing appearances could be.  
他们慢慢站起来。几乎有点像同僚关系。当他们开始站起来的时候，几个瞬间，几乎让人觉得飞行员们可能因为在《新世纪福音战士》中的经历而彼此靠近。没有人知道 Shinji 是如何让 Touji 残废的。没有人知道他们几乎死于非命。没有人知道她的精神崩溃。没有人真正了解他是多么的懦弱。外表是多么令人困惑。

Applause thundered again and Asuka turned from the vigorously applauding principal, beaming a flawless smile back at the hooting crowd. Shinji could only blush and shrink back beneath the attention. Touji reveled in the applause, considering himself lucky to even be called a pilot.  
掌声再次响起，明日香转身离开热情鼓掌的校长，向欢呼的人群展现出完美的微笑。新吉只能脸红退缩，不敢接受这样的关注。刀二则沉浸在掌声中，觉得自己很幸运能被称为一名驾驶员。

But the moment died a little when she saw him there in the crowd of students. Asuka didn't take her eyes off of the one face she recognized in the crowd. It was Fukai and he was looking at the oblivious Shinji. He had the strangest smile on his face; Asuka remarked that for all his handsome features, this particular smile did not make him look very pleasant.  
但当她看到他站在学生群中时，气氛有些变冷。明日香没有移开目光，只盯着人群中那张熟悉的脸。那是深海，他正看着毫不知情的新吉。他脸上挂着一抹奇怪的微笑；明日香注意到，尽管他有着英俊的外表，但这个微笑并没有让他看起来很愉快。

-

Back to class. 回到教室。

He did not want to go back to class. Students jostled him, everyone pouring out of the auditorium almost faster than they had entered. Many were still talking about the movie, occasionally directing their glances his way. But he did not even glean happiness from this envy; to him, it looked as if their stares were casting him out rather than admiring him. And maybe some of them really were.  
他不想回教室。学生们推搡着他，每个人都几乎比他们进入的速度更快地涌出礼堂。许多人仍在谈论电影，偶尔朝他这边瞥一眼。但他甚至没有从这种嫉妒中感到快乐；在他看来，他们的凝视似乎是在排斥他，而不是在欣赏他。也许其中一些人确实是。

He made his way back to the classroom on the second floor, and then stopped, pausing at the bathroom again. He went back in and got a handful of water out of the sink. Splashed it on his face. Trying to just _feel_ normal. Gulped some down. The cool sensation of the water gliding down his throat. _You can do this. Everything's fine. You didn't. You didn't. Hurt. Them._ After a sigh he resigned himself to attending class and made his way back to A-2. _Chin up, Shinji. Chin up._  
他沿着楼梯上了二楼的教室，然后停下来，再次在洗手间停顿了一下。他走回去，从水池里舀了一把水。把脸泼了一下。试图让自己感觉正常。大口喝了一些。水顺着喉咙滑下的凉爽感觉。你可以做到的。一切都好。你没有。你没有。伤害。他们。叹了口气后，他只好接受上课的安排，然后回到 A-2 教室。抬起头，真治。抬起头。

But then, just beyond the girl's bathroom he spotted Fukai and Asuka talking to each other. Fukai had one hand on the wall Asuka had her back against. Shinji didn't alter his stride; he pretended he hadn't even seen them. Maintained his slow amble to class. Asuka tossed her red hair around, whipping it into his periphery vision while looking deeply into Fukai's stare. She was smiling, animated.  
但是，就在女生厕所的旁边，他看到深和明日香在交谈。深的一只手靠在墙上，明日香背靠着墙。新吉没有改变步伐；他假装没有看到他们。保持缓慢地走向教室。明日香摇动她的红发，将它抽到他的视野之中，同时深情地凝视着深。她笑着，生动活泼。

Asuka's talking with him. Maybe she likes him?  
明日香在和他说话。也许她喜欢他？

What happened next he did not quite expect. Suddenly the two embraced, lips together in what he could see to be only a "kiss." A real kiss, not like the time she'd grabbed his nose. A lips-to-lips, full on kiss. He tried not to look, keeping his head down and directing his gaze firmly at the floor. _Pretend. It's not. There._  
接下来发生的事情让他有些意外。突然间，两人拥抱在一起，嘴唇相互贴在一起，他看到的只能是一个“吻”。一个真正的吻，不像她抓住他的鼻子那次。唇对唇，真正的吻。他努力不去看，低着头，目光坚定地朝地板看去。假装。那不是。在那里。

_Asuka kissed him. They kissed?  
明日香吻了他。他们接吻了？_

Fukai turned away from her though as Shinji was about to pass them and glared. Daring Shinji, just daring him to react so he'd have the excuse. _To what? Beat me up?_ Shinji didn't return the menacing stare or its confident grin. Until the hand jerked out and grabbed him by the shoulder.  
深井正要经过他们时，深井转身背对着她，怒视着。挑衅深井，就是在挑衅他，这样他就有借口了。借口做什么？打我？深井没有回敬那威胁的眼神或自信的笑容。直到那只手突然伸出，抓住了他的肩膀。

"Hey! Shit-for-brains! You got a problem or something?"  
“喂！脑袋里装屎的家伙！你有问题吗？”

Shinji returned the glare with no enthusiasm.  
新垣深冬毫不热情地回视着。

"You have no idea..." he muttered, looking away.  
“你根本不知道……”他喃喃自语，扭过头去。

That was when the punch came. And he hit the floor.  
就在这时，一拳击中了他，他倒在地板上。

-

_Tell me that did not just happen. Please tell me he did not just... oh shit, Fukai. You fucking prick. You've ruined it! Shit! Shit!  
告诉我那不是真的。请告诉我他没有刚刚... 哦该死，深井。你这个混蛋。你毁了一切！该死！该死！_

Asuka was staring at her classmate as he knelt onto Shinji's chest to begin pummeling him. Frantically she glanced around the hall to see if any teacher was making their way towards the scuffle. There was not a soul to be seen. Everyone was already back in class, being lectured and totally unaware.  
明日香盯着她的同学，看着他跪在新吉的胸口上开始殴打他。她焦急地环顾大厅，看看有没有老师朝着混战走来。没有一个人影。每个人都已经回到教室里，正在听课，完全不知情。

_What the hell do I do now?  
我现在该怎么办？_

Shinji looked up at her pleadingly from behind the cover of his brown bangs, tears bursting free as another hook nailed him in the side of the head.  
新吉从褐色刘海后哀求地抬起头，眼泪如泉涌出，又一根钩子钉在他脑袋旁边。

_Fight you moron! Fight! Do something! If you aren't even going to fight for me... at least, at least do it for yourself.  
打吧，你这白痴！打吧！做点什么！如果你甚至都不为我而战...至少，至少为了你自己也该这样做。_

He did not. Would not.  
他没有。也不会。

Fukai reared back for another hit, still streaming curses. Shinji did not raise to block. He just watched Asuka from those streaming eyes, staring and waiting helplessly.  
福井退后准备再次出手，嘴里不停地骂着。新吉没有抬手阻挡，只是用那双眼睛盯着明日香，无助地凝视着等待。

_Relying on me to get you out of this mess. You really are. Worthless.  
指望我来帮你摆脱困境。你真是。一无是处。_

Asuka grabbed the boy's arm before he could hit and, he turned at her grip, looking as if he might just go and hit her too for good measure.  
明日香在男孩打击之前抓住了他的胳膊，他因她的控制而转身，看起来好像他也可能会打她以示警告。

"Leave him," she tried, "he's not worth it."  
“别管他，”她试图说，“他不值得。”

The rage boiled away. Fukai stood. Spat on the crumple of Shinji beneath the two of them.  
愤怒消退了。深井站了起来。在他们两人上方的新司身下吐了口水。

They walked away. 他们走开了。

-

He was trying to get the blood to stop coming out of his nose, for the third time. His eye was starting to swell. He looked into the mirror, disgusted with himself. Disgusted with the hands that kept splashing water onto his face. Disgusted with the eyes that refused to stop tearing. Disgusted with the pain in his jaw. Disgusted with everything he'd ever done.  
他试图让鼻子里的血停止流出，这已经是第三次了。他的眼睛开始肿了。他看着镜子，对自己感到恶心。对那只不停往脸上泼水的手感到恶心。对那些拒绝停止流泪的眼睛感到恶心。对下巴的疼痛感到恶心。对他所做的一切感到恶心。

_"He's not worth it," she said. I'm not worth anything, am I? Even Asuka wouldn't help me. I should just... quit all this.  
"“他不值得的，”她说。我一无是处，对吧？即使明日香也不会帮助我。我应该只是…放弃这一切。”_

He walked back out of the bathroom for the second time. Numb. Each stride to the classroom he did not feel. Each breath. The raw aching in his mouth. The sting in his nostril. They didn't mean anything to him any more.  
他第二次走出浴室。麻木。他走向教室的每一步都没有感觉。每一次呼吸。嘴里的生疼。鼻孔的刺痛。对他来说，这一切都不再有任何意义。

_Instrumentality. I did that. I took Takeshi's mother away from him—just the way Eva took mine. He has the right to hate me, doesn't he? I took her away from Fukai. And now he's taking Asuka away from me. That's fair, right? Right? Yeah... fair. Fair is fair.  
仪式。我做到了。我把武的母亲从他身边带走了——就像 EVA 带走了我的一样。他有权恨我，对吧？我把她从深井身边带走了。现在他正在把明日香从我身边带走。这很公平，对吧？对吧？是的...公平。公平就是公平。_

He was in class. Sat down. He could feel sweat beading on his brow. The numbness faded. Into something worse. Those memories. So very much worse. He did not want to see her like that. Could not bear it again.  
他在教室里。坐下来。他感觉到汗珠在额头上凝结。麻木感消失了。变成了更糟的感觉。那些记忆。如此糟糕。他不想再看到她那样。无法再忍受。

_How could you, how could you, how could you...  
你怎么能，你怎么能，你怎么能…_

Murmurs exploded across the classroom at his entry. The teacher stared at Shinji, as the lesson came to a full halt.  
他走进教室时，整个教室里爆发出一阵窃窃私语。老师盯着新吉，课堂完全停顿了下来。

"Mr. Ikari, just where have you been all this... is that blood on your shirt?"  
“碇先生，你到底去了哪里……你衬衫上是血吗？”

Shinji looked down at the white uniform that had betrayed him.  
新吉低头看着出卖了他的白色制服。

"I—I had a nosebleed. Had to, wait until it stopped." He didn't return the older man's gaze. Kept his head aimed at the desk before him.  
“我——我流鼻血了。必须等它停下来。”他没有回老人的目光。一直保持着头朝着他面前的桌子。

"I suppose that's where the bruising on your eye came from too then? Mr. Ikari, have you been in a fight with another student?"  
“我猜你眼睛上的淤青也是从那里来的？伊卡利先生，你和另一个学生打架了吗？”

More murmurs, louder and faster. He ignored them. Ignored the question.  
更多的低语声，声音更大更快。他置之不理。忽略了这个问题。

_Don't listen to these people.  
不要听这些人的话。_

"If you don't answer me, Ikari, I'll have no choice but to send you to the principal's office. I'll ask one more time: who were you fighting?"  
“碇，如果你不回答我，我只能把你送到校长办公室去了。我再问一次：你和谁打架了？”

Was he shaking. No couldn't be. Couldn't be.  
他在发抖吗。不可能。不可能。

_But they'll forget Rei's name. Just like everyone else. Just like the presentation today. I'm sorry, Rei.  
但他们会忘记 Rei 的名字。就像其他人一样。就像今天的演讲一样。对不起，Rei。_

_How could you, how could you, how could you...  
你怎么能，你怎么能，你怎么能…_

He almost shouted as a flashback of Rei II's self-destruction whipped through him. He clenched his teeth and struggled to keep the brimming tears in, gripping his desk with white knuckles; his world just kept spinning.  
他几乎大声喊道，Rei II 自我毁灭的闪回在他脑海中挥之不去。他咬紧牙关，努力忍住眼泪，白着手指抓住桌子；他的世界依然在旋转。

"I deserved it, okay?" he said, struggling to keep his voice even. "It's not a. Big deal."  
“我应该的，好吗？”他说着，努力保持声音平稳。“这没什么大不了的。”

"Teach, Shinji would never get in a fight with anyone. He's a—"  
“老师，新吉永不会和任何人打架。他是一个——”

"Mr. Suzuhara, you are not part of this conversation," snapped the sensei. "Shinji, are you not going to answer?"  
“铃原先生，你不是这次谈话的一部分，”老师厉声说道。“真司，你不打算回答吗？”

_Asuka. Falling apart. White. Vultures. How could you? How could you, Shinji?  
明日香。支离破碎。白色。秃鹫。你怎么能？你怎么能，真司？_

Could he scream? He wanted to. So very badly he wanted to. Whispered instead.  
他能尖叫吗？他想要。他非常渴望。却只是轻声细语。

"It only happened because I'm. Worthless."  
"这只是因为我是无用的。"

"Mr. Ikari, you are going to the principal's office right now and we are going to find out what happened one way—"  
"伊卡利先生，你现在就去校长办公室，我们会弄清楚到底发生了什么一种方式——"

_"Why did you send for me? Why now?" "Because I have a use for you."  
"你为什么找我？为什么现在找我？"" "因为我需要你。"_

"Fuck your 'principal,'" he said under his breath.  
“去你的‘校长’，”他低声说道。

Ka-boom. He'd never heard the class that silent. The old man looked like he might just have a heart attack. Shaking with rage.  
咔嚓。他从未听过班级如此寂静。那位老人看起来可能会心脏病发作。愤怒地颤抖着。

"You—what did you say? What the principal?"  
“你——你说什么？校长是什么？”

_"We won't be living together anymore. You're being sent your Uncle's. I have work to attend to." He walked off without another word. Not even a "goodbye."  
"“我们不会再住在一起了。你要去你叔叔那里。我有工作要处理。” 他走开，没有再多说一句话。甚至没有一个“再见”。”_

_All you have to do is run away. Run away from them.  
你所要做的就是逃跑。逃离他们。_

Shinji stood up and began to leave.  
真治站起来开始离开。

The man caught him be the arm.  
那个男人抓住了他的胳膊。

"Stop right there." “站住！”

"Don't touch me!" The scream found him. He trembled with its force. "Don't you fucking touch me! _Ever_!"  
“别碰我！”尖叫声传到他耳中。他在尖叫声的冲击下颤抖着。“别他妈碰我！永远别碰我！”

The offending hand and its stunned partner released him and he stepped out of the class.  
冒犯的手和它惊讶的伙伴放开了他，他走出了教室。

-

Asuka stood outside the entrance to the school, biting fingernails with an intensity that suggested more than just a bad habit.  
明日香站在学校入口外，咬着指甲，表现出超乎普通坏习惯的强烈紧张。

"Asuka, what—what happened today?" Hikari's tiny voice crept into her musing.  
“明日香，今天发生了什么事？”希望的微弱声音渗入了她的沉思中。

"I have no idea." Lying was far easier than any other answer.  
“我不知道。” 说谎比其他任何答案都容易。

_What did I do? Oh shit, Asuka. What the fuck did I think I was doing?  
我做了什么？哦该死，明日香。我他妈以为自己在干什么？_

"Do you have any idea who might have hit him?"  
“你知道是谁打他的吗？”

"No." Definitely stick with the lying.  
“不。”一定要坚持撒谎。

"You don't think it was..." She stopped, waiting for Asuka to finish the thought.  
“你不觉得是……”她停下来，等着明日香把话说完。

Touji had brawled with Fukai in class once he spotted the bloody knuckles just a few moments after Shinji's departure. They were now being lectured in the principal's office. Where Shinji most definitely was not. She'd already checked.  
当冬二看到福井的血手指关于在课堂上与他打架的事情时，他立刻意识到离开的几分钟后。他们现在正在校长办公室接受训斥。而明日香绝对不在那里。她已经检查过了。

"I don't know. Fukai has a mean streak for Shinji, right? Maybe they... got into an argument or something." _Liar._  
“我不知道。深井对真司有点刻薄，对吧？也许他们……发生了争执什么的。” 说谎者。

"Jeeze but Shinji was acting so... I mean, have you ever seen him do that before?" _A couple time's in an Evangelion yeah. Never in real life._  
“天啊，但是真司的表现太……我的意思是，你以前见过他那样吗？” 在《新世纪福音战士》里有几次。现实生活中从未见过。

"No."

"Do you suppose he's okay?"  
“你觉得他还好吗？”

"I very much doubt that could be possible anymore." Asuka sighed.  
“我非常怀疑这还可能发生。”明日香叹了口气。

"Was it the ceremony?" “是因为仪式吗？”

"No. Something else, maybe the fight, maybe..."  
“不是。可能是其他事情，也许是战斗，也许是……”

_"He isn't worth your time." "It's only because I'm. Worthless." Maybe that, huh?  
“他不值得你的时间。”“只是因为我是无价之宝。”也许是这样，是吗？_

"Maybe what?" Hikari continued for her.  
“也许什么？”光继续问道。

"I don't know. I don't know, Hikari, really I don't. I'm just as surprised as you are. And everyone else for that matter."  
“我不知道。真的不知道，光，我和你一样吃惊。实际上，所有其他人也是。”

Hikari paused, face turned up to the afternoon sky with a thinking expression concealed behind the freckles.  
光停顿了一下，脸庞仰望着午后的天空，脸上覆盖着雀斑背后隐藏的思考表情。

"Even if he was sad, he was always nice, wasn't he?"  
“即使他伤心，他总是很友善，对吧？”

"Yeah. Nice." _But where did that go? Right down the drain is where, thanks to your stupid plan._  
“是的。友善。”但那又怎样？都被你愚蠢的计划毁了。”

"Asuka, can you just promise me when you go home you'll talk to him? He could probably really use a friend right now."  
"明日香，你能不能答应我，回家后跟他谈谈？他现在可能真的需要一个朋友。"

"Yeah. A friend." She tried to keep from zoning out into the confusing mix of feelings she held for that particular "friend." But she hadn't really been much of a friend today, had she?  
""是的。一个朋友。"" 她努力不要陷入对那个特别的“朋友”所怀有的复杂感情中。但她今天并没有真正做一个好朋友，是吧？

"I gotta go talk to Touji and the principal. See ya later, Asuka."  
"我得去找刀二和校长谈谈。待会见，明日香。"

"Bye." “再见。”

She stood still on the steps and alone, looking so lost now. And feeling helpless for the first time she could remember since one year ago.  
她独自站在台阶上，看起来如此迷茫。这是她记忆中自一年前以来第一次感到无助。

Just like this morning, she had two identical briefcases under her arms.  
就像今天早上一样，她双臂下夹着两个一模一样的公文包。

-

He smiled a genuine smile as his head smashed against the side of the bathtub. He'd done it finally. _Go to sleep. It's over_, he thought as he closed his eyes. He was already beginning to feel tired. Something was happening to the door. Someone was banging on it maybe? He thought he could just faintly hear Asuka shouting at him from somewhere. _She sounds so far away. Too far away. Just like I was for her. When I let her die. Bastard. HOW COULD YOU? You spineless fucking bastard. You deserved this._  
他微笑着，真诚的笑容随着头部撞击浴缸边缘而浮现。他终于做到了。去睡吧。结束了，他闭上眼睛想。他已经开始感到疲倦。门上发生了什么事。也许有人在敲门？他觉得他可以隐约听到明日香从某个地方对他喊叫。她听起来好远。太远了。就像我对她而言一样。当我让她死去。混蛋。你怎么能？你这个没脊梁的混蛋。你活该。

The door blurred into darkness. When he could see it again it had burst inwards. He thought he could just make out someone running towards him. And then someone's arms were around him, holding him and shaking him. Why wouldn't they just let him sleep? He thought he could feel tears streaming down his face but he wasn't sure if they were his. Then he couldn't really feel anything anymore. Just. Dark.  
门模糊成黑暗。当他再次看到它时，门已经被撞开了。他觉得他可以看到有人朝他跑来。然后有人的手臂环绕着他，握着他，摇晃着他。他们为什么不让他睡觉呢？他觉得自己的脸上有泪水流下来，但他不确定是不是他的。然后他再也感觉不到任何东西了。只有。黑暗。

-

Asuka opened the door to their apartment and entered silently. She spotted his shoes on the floor near the entrance and sighed. _So he is home. Damn._  
明日香打开了公寓的门，悄无声息地走了进去。她看到他的鞋子在入口附近的地板上，叹了口气。他果然在家。该死。

She trudged into the kitchen to find Misato opening a beer with some paperwork in her hand. She looked up when Asuka entered and faked a smile. Asuka could read the distress in her eyes.  
她跋涉进厨房，发现美里正在开着一瓶啤酒，手里拿着一些文件。当明日香进来时，她抬起头，假装微笑。明日香能从她的眼中读出烦恼。

"Oh, hey, you're back," she said, taking a break from chewing on the end of a helpless pen.  
“哦，嘿，你回来了，”她说着，放下手中无辜笔尖的咬。

"Yeah. I'm back." “是的。我回来了。”

She sat down at the table putting the two briefcases down beside her.  
她坐在桌子旁边，把两个公文包放在身边。

"So. How was school today? Oh yeah! How was the ceremony?" Misato said. It sounded as if she'd genuinely forgotten about it.  
“那么。今天学校怎么样？哦对了！典礼怎么样？” 美里说。她听起来好像真的忘了这件事。

"Didn't they call already?" she ventured.  
“他们不是已经打电话来了吗？”她猜测道。

"Yeah." Misato frowned at the beer. "Shinji got in a fight or something. I haven't been able to talk to him about it actually..."  
“是的。” 美里皱着眉头看着啤酒。“新吉好像打架了。我还没能和他谈论这件事呢…”

Asuka could almost feel the concern pouring off her guardian.  
明日香几乎能感受到她的监护人散发出的关切。

"Asuka, did Shinji seem alright? I mean, when he first came in to school today? He was okay, right?" Asuka eyed her guardian suspiciously.  
“明日香，新吉看起来还好吗？我是说，他今天上学时是不是没事？他没事，对吧？”明日香怀疑地盯着她的监护人。

"Yeah, I'd say he seemed about the same to me. Maybe a little quiet but, about what I would have expected given the ceremony and all." She wanted to tell Misato what happened. She really did but.  
“是的，我觉得他对我来说差不多。也许有点安静，但考虑到仪式等等，这正是我所预料的。”她想告诉美里发生了什么。她真的想，但是。

"Good. Good to hear. Poor guy. He's been through a lot today," she said, sighing into her beer can. Relief flooded into her reply.  
“好。好听到。可怜的家伙。他今天经历了很多，”她说着，叹息着啤酒罐里。宽慰涌入她的回答。

"What do you mean?" Asuka said, cocking her head to the side.  
“你是什么意思？”明日香说着，歪着头。

"You know. Running away and, uh... stuff. Um, just forget I said that actually. I can't talk about it anyways."  
“你知道的。逃跑和，嗯...之类的事情。嗯，其实还是算了吧。反正我也不能说。”

Misato smiled nervously behind the can of Yebisu.  
美里笑着在一罐“Yebisu”啤酒后面紧张地笑了笑。

"What the heck does that mean?"  
“这是什么意思？”

"It's a NERV secret, okay? Classified. Sorry."  
“这是 NERV 的秘密，好吗？机密。抱歉。”

"You guys are still keeping secrets from us? Come on! What gives? I wanna know too!" Asuka was back into the whiny/angry mode she was most comfortable in when speaking to Misato. But it did not work this time.  
“你们还在瞒着我们保密？得了吧！怎么回事？我也想知道！”明日香又开始用她最擅长的抱怨/愤怒模式和美里交谈。但这次没有起作用。

"Nope. I'm sorry, Asuka. I can't tell you this one. I mean, if I did... Ritsuko would never let me hear the end of it, that's for sure. Besides it's probably nothing at all. Forget I even said it." But the way she spoke, Asuka immediately knew that this could not be the case. Something was wrong with Shinji before he even got to school. Before the whole Fukai mess.  
“不行。对不起，明日香。这个我不能告诉你。我是说，如果我说了的话...莉茜子肯定会没完没了地责备我，那是肯定的。而且这可能根本就不是什么大不了的事。就当我什么都没说吧。”但她说话的语气让明日香立刻意识到情况并非如此。在新司甚至到校之前，就有什么不对劲了。在整个深井事件之前。

Misato took another swig from her beer can innocently, trying to brush the whole thing off. Asuka gripped, unwilling. Not yet.  
美里无辜地又喝了一口啤酒，试图淡化整件事。明日香抓住，不愿。还不是时候。

"Fine. Just tell me one thing: does Shinji know this one? This secret?" Asuka asked, growing serious.  
“好吧。告诉我一件事：新吉知道这个秘密吗？”明日香问道，变得严肃起来。

Misato looked at her hard with something uncomfortable filling her gaze. Asuka felt nervous when Misato looked at her like that. She hadn't seen that face in a long, long time. _Not since..._  
美里用一种令人不安的目光看着她。明日香感到紧张，当美里用那种眼神看着她时。她很久很久没见过那张脸了。自从……

"I don't think he knows. No, probably not," she said very quietly after a few moments pause.  
“我觉得他不知道。不，可能不知道，”她安静地说了一会儿后。

"There probably is no secret," Asuka growled, desperately wishing it was true and at the same time knowing it wasn't from the way her guardian looked at her.  
“可能根本没有秘密，”明日香咆哮着，拼命希望这是真的，同时又从她监护人看着她的方式知道这不可能。

"Maybe," Misato teased. But it was forced. Something had happened today to Shinji. She was sure of it now.  
“也许吧，”美里调侃道。但是这是勉强的。今天肯定发生了什么事情让新吉不同寻常。她现在确定了。

Asuka reluctantly dropped the subject and walked out of the kitchen after some more small talk with the woman. She held Shinji's briefcase firmly as she knocked on his door. There was no reply. Cautious now, she slid the door halfway open.  
明日香勉强放弃了话题，与那位女士闲聊了一会儿后走出了厨房。她紧握着真司的公文包，在敲了敲他的门后。没有回应。她变得谨慎起来，将门推开了一半。

"Go away," said a tiny voice from the boy curled up in his bed. His back was turned to her.  
“走开，”床上蜷缩着的男孩发出微弱的声音。他背对着她。

"I just wanted to give you your briefcase. Sorry," she whispered. She could not remember ever apologizing to him. She felt strangely satisfied, yet terribly guilty in the same moment.  
“我只是想把你的公文包还给你。对不起，”她轻声说道。她想不起曾经向他道过歉。她感到奇怪的满足，但同时又感到极度的内疚。

Asuka put the briefcase just inside the room then stood at the door, just watching his still form. If Shinji could have seen her face at this moment he would have seen an Asuka unlike any other. Her blue eyes were filled up with something no one else could have recognized: sadness—the kind she smothered away in anger most of her life; the sort of sadness she wouldn't let anyone else see. Not since the days after her mother's suicide. But he did not turn. He did not know. Could not.  
明日香把公文包放在房间里，然后站在门口，静静地看着他静止的身影。如果真知能看到她此刻的表情，他会看到一个与众不同的明日香。她的蓝眼睛里充满了一种别人无法认出的东西：悲伤——她一生中大部分时间都用愤怒掩盖的那种悲伤；那种她不愿让别人看到的悲伤。自从母亲自杀后的那些日子以来，她从未展现过。但他没有转身。他不知道。也无法知晓。

"Just, go away. Please," he pleaded in the same, almost non-existent voice.  
“请，离开。拜托，”他用同样微弱几乎听不见的声音恳求道。

Asuka slid the door shut and stopped, just staring at the handle. _I guess I'll just wait. Until dinner. Yeah. Maybe I will tell him after dinner._  
明日香推上门，停下来，盯着门把手。我想我会等等。等到晚饭。是的。也许晚饭后我会告诉他。

Dinner came and went with no sign of Shinji Ikari. She'd heard the same sad boy when Misato had tried to coax him out of his room with everything from threats to innuendo. He just begged her to "leave him alone" and nothing more and eventually Misato gave up. So it was only she and Asuka for dinner.  
晚饭结束了，却没有见到碇真嗣的踪影。她听到了当美里尝试用威胁和暗示来诱使他出房间时，他只是乞求她“别打扰他”，什么也没说，最终美里放弃了。所以晚饭只有她和明日香。

Neither ate much. Misato seemed far too worried about Shinji to do anything more than sip at her beer and glance at his door occasionally. As if desperately trying to figure out what the hell she was going to do with him.  
两人都吃得很少。美里似乎对碇真嗣担心得太多，只能啜饮着啤酒，偶尔瞥一眼他的房门。仿佛拼命地想弄清楚她究竟要怎么处理他。

Asuka, on the other hand, seemed to have lost her appetite altogether. She kept looking at the spot where Shinji would sit at the table. She realized now that she missed having him there. She'd been realizing a lot of things about him today.  
另一方面，明日香似乎完全失去了胃口。她一直盯着真嗣在餐桌上坐的位置。她现在意识到她想念他在那里的时刻。她今天对他的认识有了很多新的发现。

Dinner finished and after Asuka had done her share of the dishes (it was Shinji's turn but neither girl seemed inclined to bother him) she moved into the living room and sat down to watch some TV. The couch was "coincidentally" just a few feet away from the entrance to Shinji's room.  
晚饭结束后，明日香洗完了她份的碗（轮到真嗣了，但两个女孩似乎都不想打扰他），她走进客厅坐下来看电视。沙发“巧合地”就在离真嗣房间入口几英尺的地方。

Shows droned on. The News at nine-o'clock came on. And turned off too. Finally, at ten thirty, the brown-haired boy appeared.  
节目一个接一个。九点的新闻开始了。然后也结束了。最后，在十点半的时候，那个棕发男孩出现了。

Before Asuka could even look his way he had started off towards the bathroom, ignoring her entirely.  
明日香甚至还没来得及看向他，他就朝着浴室走去，完全不理睬她。

_Goddamn it! He's avoiding me! But, I have to talk to him. I have to explain the whole Fukai thing. Tell him that I didn't mean for him to get hurt, that I didn't want to kiss that asshole. Then maybe... well, maybe he will understand how I feel. Sort of.  
该死！他在躲避我！但是，我必须和他谈一下。我必须解释整个深井的事情。告诉他我并不是故意让他受伤，我也不想亲那个混蛋。也许...也许他会明白我的感受。或多或少。_

Asuka waited on the couch for another thirty seconds, then, working up the courage, she approached the bathroom door and knocked once. No reply again.  
明日香在沙发上等了又等，又过了三十秒，鼓起勇气，她走向浴室门，敲了一下。再次没有回应。

"Shinji, are you in there?" she said loud enough so that he would hear her.  
“真嗣，你在里面吗？”她大声说，让他能听见。

There was no reply. 没有回应。

"Shinji, can you hear me?" she said, louder now.  
“真司，你能听到我说话吗？”她声音更大了。

"Shinji, if you can hear me just say something…" she tried.  
“真司，如果你能听到我，就说点什么吧…”她试着说道。

She put her hand on the handle of the door and found it firmly locked. He was certainly in there, she thought. _Probably hanging on my every word too. Fuck. Fuck it._  
她把手放在门把手上，发现门被牢牢锁住了。她想，他肯定在里面。可能还在认真听着我的每个字。该死。该死。

"Fine. I just wanted to say..." she paused, sighing. "I just wanted to say I am sorry about today. That thing with Fukai... was a stupid mistake. It wasn't what it looked like. And. What I did was wrong. I should have helped you, Shinji. I know I don't always act like it but, I want to be your... friend. I hope I still am. And. I didn't—I didn't mean to hurt your feelings if I did. So. I'm sorry. Okay? Shinji?"  
“好吧。我只是想说……”她停顿了一下，叹了口气。“我只是想说今天对不起。那件事和福开……是一个愚蠢的错误。不是看起来的样子。而且。我做错了。我应该帮助你，真司。我知道我并不总是表现出来，但是，我想成为你的……朋友。我希望我还是。而且。如果我伤害了你的感情，我并不是故意的。所以。对不起。好吗？真司？”

Still there was silence. Something twitched in her. A feeling she'd forgotten since the Angels: fear. Tiny. Cold. Fear.  
依然是寂静。她心中有些不安。自从天使来袭以来，她已经忘记了的感觉又涌上心头：恐惧。微弱。冰冷。恐惧。

"Shinji, are you okay?" “真嗣，你没事吧？”

More silence. 更多的沉默。

"Shinji, if you don't say you're okay, I'm coming in there!" she threatened.  
“真嗣，如果你不说你没事，我就要进去了！”她威胁道。

Nothing. 什么都没有。

"I mean it! I don't care if you're naked or... Whatever! I'll do it, Shinji! Shinji?"  
“我是认真的！我不在乎你是赤裸的还是……什么！我会做的，真司！真司？”

She thought she heard the sound of something being knocked over. Loudly clattering onto the floor. Then nothing. What the hell was that noise?  
她觉得自己听到了一样东西被撞倒的声音。大声地哗啦一声掉在地板上。然后什么声音也没有了。那是什么声音？

Twitching. In her. What if he passed out? What if this was what Misato wouldn't tell her? He might be hurt. Was she going to let him get hurt again?  
抽搐。在她身上。如果他晕倒了怎么办？如果这就是美里不告诉她的事情？他可能受伤了。她会再让他受伤吗？

"SHINJI? Don't make me kick this door down! Are you okay?" She was shouting now.  
“真嗣？别逼我踢开这扇门！你没事吧？”她现在在大声喊叫。

Nothing seemed to answer. If Shinji was in there he was being very quiet.  
似乎没有任何回应。如果真嗣在里面，他现在非常安静。

"Shinji! You're scaring me…" she pleaded.  
“真妮！你在吓我…”她恳求道。

Nothing. Fear. Raw. Simple. Fear.  
无。恐惧。原始。简单。恐惧。

"I'm counting to three then I'm kicking the door down, for real! You hear that?"  
“我数到三，然后我就真的要踢开这扇门了！你听到了吗？”

This wasn't right. Even for Shinji.  
这不对。即使对于真嗣来说。

"I'm serious, Shinji! Don't make me do it!"  
“我是认真的，真嗣！不要逼我这么做！”

Horrible, empty, nothing.  
可怕，空虚，一无所有。

"One! Two! Three!" “一！二！三！”

Nothing still. 仍然没有任何动静。

Asuka, now too frightened to stop, kicked the door once hard. It didn't really move. She roared at it and kicked the door several more times. It dented but held. She put all the power she could muster into one blow aimed at the handle. The tiny lock exploded and gave so that it swung violently inwards.  
明日香现在太害怕停下来了，她用力踢了一下门。门并没有真正移动。她对着门咆哮，连续踢了几次。门凹陷了但还是挺住了。她将所有力量集中在一个目标为门把手的一击中。小小的锁爆裂开来，门猛烈地向内摆动。

Nothing could prepare her for what she saw next. He lay crumpled besides the bathtub in a pool of his own blood. Red. Everywhere. All over him and soaking into most of his white shirt. It kept pouring out of his arms faster and faster. It would not slow down, would not stop.  
接下来她看到的让她措手不及。他瘫倒在浴缸旁，身下是一滩自己的鲜血。红色。无处不在。覆盖了他的身体，浸透了他的白衬衫大部分。血液不断地从他的手臂中涌出，越来越快。它不会减缓，也不会停止。

And she screamed running to him. She screamed and screamed as she picked him up, cradling him against her—holding him in her arms and just praying that this boy hadn't left her for good already. Her screams turned into one long stretched out wail as the tears rushed, useless. Sobbing, still holding him, face pressed into that beautiful soft brown hair. Just like she'd always dreamed they'd be one day. Only completely and horribly wrong. A dream turned nightmare.  
她尖叫着跑向他。她尖叫着，尖叫着，把他抱起来，将他搂在怀里，只是祈祷这个男孩还没有永远地离开她。她的尖叫变成了一声拉长的哀鸣，眼泪涌出，毫无用处。抽泣着，仍然抱着他，脸埋在那柔软的棕色头发中。就像她一直梦想的那样，他们有一天会成为的样子。只是完全错了。一个梦变成了噩梦。

Misato appeared in the doorway seconds later, and before she could finish asking just "what the hell" Asuka was screaming about her jaw dropped open and she froze. Then yelling into her wrist. Asuka couldn't hear it. All she could pay attention to was the face of this boy in her arms, his eyes closed as her tears spattered across his soft, slackening cheeks. The facial expression of someone dead or dying written all over his delicate features.  
几秒钟后，美里出现在门口，还没来得及问“到底发生了什么”，明日香尖叫的声音传入她的耳中，她的下巴掉了下来，呆住了。然后她对着手腕大声说话。明日香听不见。她唯一能关注的就是怀中这个男孩的脸，他闭着眼睛，她的眼泪洒在他柔软、慢慢松弛的脸颊上。死去或垂死的表情写在他那精致的面容上。

Section Two thugs came charging into the bathroom from out of nowhere or so it seemed. They wasted no time, instantly grabbing the boy out of her arms and, she cried out, weakly reaching for him even as they carried him out of the bathroom and then out of the apartment entirely.  
第二部分，两个暴徒突然冲进浴室，就像从无处而来一样。他们毫不犹豫，立刻从她的怀里抢走了男孩，她大声呼喊着，虚弱地伸手想要抓住他，即使他们把他从浴室带出，然后彻底带出公寓。

Misato embraced her, stopping her as she tried to follow him out. She ignored the blood all over her charge's shirt and arms, pressing the girl against her, cupping her head on her shoulder. Asuka could just barely see them through the open doorway putting him onto some sort of stretcher. Misato pressed her face into that red hair and wept softly, squeezing Asuka even tighter. She could hear a helicopter somewhere. Then Shinji was lifting up and out of the open-air courtyard. Gone.  
美里拥抱住她，阻止她试图跟着他走。她无视男孩衬衫和手臂上的血迹，将女孩压在她怀里，把头搁在她的肩膀上。明日香勉强能透过敞开的门看到他们把他放在某种担架上。美里把脸埋在那头红发中，轻声哭泣，更紧紧地搂住明日香。她能听到直升机的声音。然后，真治被抬起，消失在开放的庭院之外。

What had one of the thugs said when they took him from her? Something about his heart being stopped.  
当暴徒从她身边把他带走时，其中一个暴徒说了什么？关于他的心脏停止了什么。

_Dead. Clinically dead. 死了。临床死亡。_

Asuka cried harder now, a first since her childhood. Shinji was really gone this time, maybe gone for good now. She had thought he was a cold, little doll who didn't care about her anymore. But she had been wrong, totally wrong. Maybe he had even cared about her enough to take his own life. And maybe, she wondered, maybe she had destroyed him for it.  
明日香现在哭得更厉害了，这是自童年以来的第一次。真希这次真的走了，也许永远地离开了。她曾以为他是一个冷漠的小玩偶，不再在乎她。但她错了，完全错了。也许他甚至在乎她到足以结束自己的生命。也许，她想，也许是她毁了他。

"My fault," she kept moaning into Misato's shoulder over and over again. The tears refused to stop as the two clutched each other, desperately. The noise of the helicopter was gone.  
“都是我的错，”她一遍又一遍地抱怨在美里的肩膀上。两人绝望地紧紧拥抱着，眼泪止不住。直升机的噪音消失了。

_Fin Two_

**A/N**:
Yeah that's an M-rating right there. Don't hate me too much for the ending. There's still one more part left. The lyrics from the beginning are from the song "Sober" by Tool. I personally found myself preferring to listen to "The Outsider" by A Perfect Circle while writing this though. Ironic I know. Final chap after chapter seven of Secrecy is out.  
是的，那确实是一个 M 级评级。不要因结局而太过讨厌我。还有最后一部分。开头的歌词来自 Tool 乐队的歌曲“Sober”。不过在写这篇时，我个人更喜欢听 A Perfect Circle 乐队的“The Outsider”。讽刺吧，我知道。《保密》第七章之后的最终篇已发布。

Love to my reviewers. Don't give up on them just yet!  
感谢我的评论者们。不要轻易放弃他们！

"The hell do you mean 'some stress?' This kid was having an intense mental breakdown."  
“你说的‘有点压力’是什么意思？这孩子正在经历一场剧烈的精神崩溃。”

Ritsuko took a slurp of cold coffee and briefly considered smashing the mug on the far wall. Briefly.  
莉茨子啜了一口冰冷的咖啡，短暂地考虑了把杯子砸向远处的墙壁。短暂地。

"Well it's a little hard to keep the language clean when you're pumping blood into him just to start his heart beating again in the chopper over."  
"当你在直升机上为他输血以重新启动他的心脏跳动时，要保持用语干净有点困难。"

She sighed. 她叹了口气。

"Yes. No. It's not that. No, no, I understand. She's taking it pretty hard then? Yeah, I'd say we all are too. For an anti-socialite he's got quite a grip on our heart-strings."  
"是的。不是。不是这个问题。不，不，我明白。她是不是很难过？是的，我会说我们所有人都很难过。对于一个不合群的人，他对我们的心弦有相当大的影响。"

Weak laughter from the receiver.  
接收器里传来了虚弱的笑声。

"Okay? Well, no, he's not okay yet. I wouldn't go that far. But is he going to live? Once his vitals stabilize, yes, I would think so. Twelve hours, maybe six, depends on what cocktail the ER pumped into him on arrival."  
“好吗？嗯，不，他还不好。我不会那么说。但他会活下来吗？一旦他的生命体征稳定下来，我想是的。十二个小时，也许六个，取决于急诊室在他到达时注入了什么药物。”

Ritsuko gnawed on her pen, staring into the screen before her.  
莉茨子咬着笔，盯着她面前的屏幕。

"And you just remember to thank me some time for suggesting that emergency chopper on the roof and the security detachment next door. Yeah. I know. Yeah, I'd say a 'life-saver' would be a pretty appropriate term at the moment."  
“你别忘了要感谢我，当时建议在屋顶上安排紧急直升机和隔壁的安保人员。是的。我知道。是的，我想说‘救命恩人’这个词现在非常贴切。”

She fumbled with something on her clipboard, scanning the read-outs over again just to make sure she wasn't missing something.  
她在剪贴板上摸索着什么东西，再次浏览读数，只是为了确保自己没有漏掉什么。

"Well, I'm not going to sugar-coat anything for you—this was a life and death situation, Misato. Physical damage is at a minimum. There's definitely going to be some scarring, nothing too unbearable but they weren't small wounds by any means. Truthfully, I think what you've really got to worry about is what's happening mentally. You and I both know Shinji's been through a lot."  
“好吧，我不会为你添油加醋——这是一场生死攸关的情况，美里。身体损伤最小。肯定会有一些疤痕，不会太难受，但这些伤口可不小。说实话，我觉得你真正需要担心的是精神上发生了什么。你我都知道，真治经历了很多。”

Ritsuko lifted a half-done cigarette from the ash-tray and took a drag. She let the smoke spill out into the dimly lit lab as she exhaled. Misato spoke through all of it.  
莉茨子从烟灰缸中拿起一支未完的香烟，抽了一口。她让烟雾在昏暗的实验室中弥漫，随着呼出。美里在其中不停地说话。

"I know. I know that. I'm just saying there's a whole lot of, well, baggage to account for. I mean, could this be a relapse from his piloting days? Obviously the date could be a significant factor also, one-year-anniversary and all. I'm not even sure what we are supposed to make of the blue pattern flicker and the amnesia you reported but let's handle the obvious for starters."  
“我知道。我知道这一点。我只是在说，有很多，嗯，要考虑的包袱。我的意思是，这可能是他驾驶机体时的复发吗？显然，日期也可能是一个重要因素，一周年纪念日之类的。我甚至不确定我们应该如何解释你报告的蓝色图案闪烁和失忆，但让我们先处理显而易见的事情。”

Puff, puff. More chatter from the receiver.  
噗噗。接收器传来更多的闲聊。

"Shit, Misato, I understand that. And I'm not claiming to be a psychologist, M.D. or not. All I'm trying to point out is that there is more at stake here than just what's happened in the last twenty-four hours and, until we can get a shrink in there when he's conscious, we can't be definitive about anything."  
“该死，美里，我明白。我并不是在声称自己是心理学家，医生也不是。我只是想指出的是，这里面牵涉到的不仅仅是过去二十四小时发生的事情，直到我们能在他清醒时找到一位心理医生，我们无法对任何事情下定论。”

She paused over one particular part of the read-out, a quizzical expression forming on her brow. She adjusted her glasses slightly.  
她在读数器上停顿了一下，额头上浮现出疑惑的表情。她微微调整了眼镜。

"No, I agree. This is not very typical of Shinji. And I think you're right. A cry for help would usually be more common in these cases and, with his personality in mind, certainly the more obvious choice. To go from relatively normal to suicidal so quickly, it doesn't really seem, psychologically at least, very, uhh, well progressive, I guess is what I'm trying to say."  
“不，我同意。这不太像是真嗣的典型行为。我认为你是对的。在这种情况下，通常会是求救的呼声更为常见，考虑到他的个性，这显然是更明显的选择。从相对正常到自杀如此迅速，至少在心理上，这似乎并不是很，嗯，很正常，我想我想说的是这个。”

Underlining another mystery with her pen.  
用笔勾勒出另一个谜团。

"To be honest, I have no idea. It could be very good for his recovery or it could have no effect at all. If you want, I can transfer you to the psych on call who's going to be looking him over; Nakamura or something—she seemed very nice and competent to me."  
“说实话，我也不清楚。这可能对他的康复非常有帮助，也可能根本没有任何效果。如果你愿意，我可以把你转到值班的心理医生那里，她会负责检查他；名字好像是中村之类的——她给我的印象非常友善和称职。”

Another sip of coffee. 再喝一口咖啡。

"Fine, fine. I won't. Besides, you're probably a better judge of these things than me. I mean, you've been living with them all this time now. What do you think?"  
好吧，好吧。我不会了。而且，你可能比我更适合评判这些事情。我是说，你已经和它们生活在一起这么长时间了。你觉得呢？

After another hard look she put the clipboard down again and rubbed her head, feeling the onset of another stress-related migraine. Either that or caffeine-deprivation. She really was becoming a coffee-holic.  
再次仔细看了一眼，她把记录板放了下来，揉了揉头，感觉又要发作压力引起的偏头痛了。要么是因为缺咖啡了。她真的正在变成咖啡控。

"For her? Well yeah, it probably would do some good. He's asleep but... sure, I'll have someone escort you to his room. Five minutes? Yeah, no problem."  
“为她？嗯，可能会有些好处。他在睡觉，但...好吧，我会让人陪你去他的房间。五分钟？好的，没问题。”

Click. She set the phone down on its base. She looked back at the problem on her clipboard. It didn't seem to be going anywhere.  
咔嚓一声。她把电话放在底座上。她回头看着手里夹着的问题。看起来进展不大。

---

Asuka clung to Misato's shifting arm the entire ride to the hospital. Her crying had turned quiet with sniffles, though her eyes held red-rimmed and gleaming with more tears to be spent. Some part of the hitching sobs Misato had never seen before had slunk away once she'd told her charge that Shinji was in fact alive and breathing again.

A part of her felt guiltily pleased that the girl really did care about him; another part told her she should be worried about the both of them, and certainly not happy. At least, Misato reasoned, she'd finally stopped wailing that all this was her fault somehow after several careful reassurances that it was "no such thing."  
她心里有一部分感到内疚地高兴，那个女孩确实关心他；另一部分告诉她，她应该担心他们两个，而不是高兴。至少，美里理智地想，她终于在经过几次仔细的安抚后停止哭泣，坚称这一切都不是她的错。

They glided into the parking space at the hospital but as Misato turned to get out of the car and help Asuka to stand, the girl's hand landed on her sleeve and stopped her in the silence of the Renault's purring engine.  
他们滑入医院的停车位，但当美里转身准备下车帮助明日香站起来时，女孩的手落在她的袖子上，让她停下来，雷诺引擎轻轻地嗡嗡作响。

"Misato..." Asuka looked down into the seat. Disturbed, Misato resumed sitting and leaned over to speak to the whispering girl.  
“美里……”明日香低头看着座位。不安的美里重新坐下，俯身对那个低声说话的女孩说话。

"What is it, honey?" “怎么了，亲爱的？”

Asuka inhaled, still looking down. _I better make sure she gets this off her chest before she sees him so we don't create any more of a scene._  
明日香吸了口气，依然低着头。在她见到他之前，最好确保她把心里话说出来，这样我们就不会制造更多场面。

"It's okay, Asuka. Whatever you need to say, you can tell me. Whatever you're feeling, it's okay to feel that way."  
“没关系，明日香。无论你想说什么，你都可以告诉我。无论你感觉如何，都可以有这样的感受。”

The redhead cleared her throat.  
那位红发女孩清了清嗓子。

"You know before when I was saying it was my fault, and... all that stuff," she began.  
“你知道之前我说是我的错，还有…所有那些事情，”她开始说道。

Misato nodded at her, putting a reassuring hand on the girl's shoulder.  
美里向她点了点头，在女孩的肩膀上安抚地拍了拍。

"Well, I wasn't being hysterical or anything," she sighed, face shifting between disappointed and pained. Her pretty, foreign features looked bafflingly elegant, even in such a frown.  
“嗯，我并没有变得歇斯底里什么的，”她叹了口气，脸上的表情在失望和痛苦之间变化。她那漂亮的外国面孔，即使是皱着眉头，看起来也令人困惑地优雅。

"You see, the truth is today. Well, today I did something really bad. Something really mean to try and hurt Shinji's feelings. And I..."  
“你看，事实是今天。嗯，今天我做了一件很糟糕的事。一件真的很刻薄的事，试图伤害真嗣的感情。而我…”

Misato nodded, urging her to continue.  
美里点了点头，催促她继续说下去。

"I think I made him... do _that..._" She cringed, eyes squinting shut. "To himself. You know? Because of what I did," she finished, her voice almost completely gone, buried underneath an ugly quiet that didn't befit her. Those blue eyes had never looked so full of despair that Misato could recall, except perhaps when his life had been in question. Asuka, she had noticed, could be frighteningly expressive when she let herself go for a moment.  
"“我觉得是我让他……那样做的……”她皱着眉头，双眼紧闭。“自己。你知道吗？因为我做过的事情。”她说完，声音几乎完全消失了，在一种不适合她的难看的寂静中被掩埋。美里记不起那双蓝眼睛曾经看起来如此绝望，除非也许是在他的生命岌岌可危时。她注意到，明日香在某一刻放开自己时，表情可以令人恐惧地丰富表达。”

She leaned over without a word and hugged the girl, just holding her there for a moment and trying to figure out what she was supposed to say to the confession.  
她默默地俯身拥抱着女孩，只是抱着她片刻，试图弄清楚她应该对这个坦白说些什么。

"That's not true," she whispered into Asuka's ear. "That's not true at all. Now you just tell me what it is you think you did so you can stop feeling guilty because this is _not_ your fault, okay?"  
“这不是真的，”她轻声对着明日香耳语。“一点也不是真的。现在告诉我你认为自己做了什么，这样你就不用再感到内疚了，好吗？”

"Well. Okay." “嗯。好的。”

Asuka sighed, returning Misato's embrace, their heads side by side on one another's shoulder.  
明日香叹了口气，回应着美里的拥抱，他们的头靠在彼此的肩膀上。

"At school. There was this guy. Takeshi Fukai. And you see. I wanted—I wanted Shinji to notice me, see. Because, well, I know he likes me. Or. I think he does. Or might. And so I kissed this other guy today, right when Shinji was walking by. You know? Just to—I don't know—just to get his attention I guess. Because I sort of like Shinji too, I guess."  
在学校。有个男生。深井武士。你知道的。我想—我想让真司注意我，明白吗。因为，嗯，我知道他喜欢我。或者。我觉得他喜欢我。或可能。所以今天我吻了另一个男生，就在真司经过的时候。你懂吗？只是为了—我不知道—可能只是为了引起他的注意吧。因为我也有点喜欢真司，我想。

She could not see the woman's shocked face and it was with good cause Misato looked as such. Asuka had never even admitted her feelings for her roommate before. Perhaps if Shinji hadn't cut himself so badly tonight she probably never would have swallowed her pride enough to do so. The girl continued on, oblivious.  
她看不到那名女性震惊的表情，而美里看起来确实震惊。明日香以前甚至从未承认过对她室友的感情。也许如果真司今晚没有割伤自己，她可能永远不会吞下足够的骄傲来这样做。女孩继续说着，毫不知情。

"I don't know. I didn't really know how to tell him how I feel. So I figured if I kissed this other boy and he got jealous, then I would know if he liked me or not right? Because... well, there was a time, back when it was really just me and him. Back when everyone else was still somewhere in that lake. And we talked a lot, you know? Talked about everything we had done together. All that stuff. And I think we were close for a while. But that whole time we were alone together he never told me how he felt about me. I guess I never told him either. Once people started showing up, that sort of... disappeared. He. He changed."  
“我不知道。我真的不知道该怎么告诉他我的感受。所以我想，如果我吻了另一个男孩，他会吃醋，那我就知道他是否喜欢我了，对吧？因为...嗯，曾经有一段时间，那时真的只有我和他。那时其他人还都在湖里。我们聊了很多，你知道吗？谈论我们一起做过的一切。所有那些事情。我觉得我们有一段时间很亲近。但在我们独处的整段时间里，他从未告诉过我他对我的感受。我想我也从未告诉过他。一旦其他人开始出现，那种...就消失了。他。他变了。”

Misato nodded to herself. Shinji had been wallowing in something nasty for some time. She'd seen it in him when they'd first moved in together and she'd watched it only get worse. Somehow Asuka, in true justice to her vanity, had gotten the idea that Shinji had tried taking his life over this incident in school. Whatever the real reason, it was probably best to let her finish so she could let this go.  
美里自言自语地点了点头。新吉一直陷入了某种糟糕的情绪中。当他们搬到一起时，她就看出了他的状态，而且只看到他变得更糟。不知何故，真正反映她虚荣的明日香认为新吉曾因学校里的那件事而试图结束自己的生命。无论真正的原因是什么，最好还是让她说完，这样她就能释怀了。

"So anyways, today I figured he would notice if I did this and he would get jealous. And if he did then I would at least know he cared about me and maybe. I don't know. Maybe I could find a way to tell him how I feel."  
“总之，今天我想他会注意到我这样做，然后会吃醋。如果他真的吃醋了，那我至少知道他在乎我，也许。我不知道。也许我可以找到一个方法告诉他我的感受。”

A sigh. 叹了口气。

"But at the time he didn't do anything, you know? He just—acted as if it hadn't happen. So then I thought maybe he really didn't care about me at all. But when he left school—I knew, I just knew I'd upset him. And then when I got home he wouldn't even look at me. So I was really worried about him. I stayed up to apologize to him but then he went to the bathroom. I thought he was trying to hide from me. So I knocked on the door and..."  
“但当时他什么都没做，你知道吗？他就像什么都没发生一样。所以我以为也许他根本不在乎我。但当他离开学校的时候，我知道，我就知道我让他生气了。然后当我回到家，他甚至不看我一眼。所以我真的很担心他。我熬夜想向他道歉，但他却去了洗手间。我以为他在躲避我。所以我敲了敲门…”

The rest of it came out as mumbles and tumbling sobs into Misato's jacket. She tried hold the confused girl tightly as she could while the teenager cried helplessly for Shinji, sometimes in rage. "How could you do this?" Sometimes begging. "I just want to be close to you again."  
其余的话都变成了喃喃自语和哭泣声，倾泻到美里的夹克里。她尽力紧紧抱住这个困惑的女孩，当这位十几岁的少女为真司哭泣时，有时是愤怒地说：“你怎么能这样做？”有时是乞求：“我只是想再靠近你一点。”

Misato did her best to comfort, starkly aware that'd she'd never felt more close to the person in her arms.  
美里尽力安慰，清楚地意识到她从未感觉过比此刻更亲近怀中的这个人。

"Shh, shh. You don't have to tell me anything else. I understand, Asuka. It's okay. But I want you to remember something. Something very, very important."  
“嘘，嘘。你不必告诉我其他任何事情。我明白，明白了，明日香。没关系。但我希望你记住一件事。一件非常、非常重要的事。”

Her crying slowed a little. Misato pulled away and took the gentle curving face in her hands, lifting Asuka's gaze so that they were eye to eye. The tears kept coming, though the blues twinkled back at her softly, intent and listening.  
她的哭声稍微停了下来。美里扶开，用手轻轻托起阿斯卡的脸，让她们的目光对视。尽管眼泪不停地流，但蓝色的眼睛却柔和地闪烁着回望着她，专注而倾听。

"And this is very important, okay? Pay close attention."  
“这非常重要，知道吗？仔细听着。”

Asuka nodded, choking away another sob.  
阿斯卡点了点头，强忍着又一阵抽泣。

"Asuka, who was the one to check on Shinji to make sure he was okay tonight? You did. And who kicked in the locked door when he wouldn't open it? You did. Who got my attention? You did. Who _saved_ Shinji today? You did. You understand that? You _saved_ him and I don't care what happened in school, none of this is your fault. You saved his life today."  
"明日香，今晚是谁去查看碇真嗣确保他没事的？是你。谁踢开了锁着的门，因为他不肯开门？是你。谁吸引了我的注意力？是你。谁救了真嗣？是你。你明白吗？你救了他，我不在乎学校发生了什么，这一切都不是你的错。今天你救了他的命。"

"But—" "可是——"

She was shaking her head, red pigtails flying. Misato caught her firmly, interrupting.  
她摇着头，红色的双马尾在飞舞。美里托紧紧地抓住她，打断了她的话。

"No 'but's! You saved him! You know you did. Now say it back to me. Say: 'I saved Shinji's life today.'"  
"不要有任何借口！你救了他！你知道你救了他。现在对我说。说：'我今天救了真司的命。'"

She nodded weakly, brushing away the hot tears with her forearm with a grunt.  
她虚弱地点了点头，用手臂擦去热泪，发出一声咕哝。

"I... I saved Shinji's life today." Something like strength was returning to her expression.  
""我...我今天救了真司的命。"" 她的表情中逐渐回归了一些力量。

"That's right. I'm sure he's dreaming of you right now," Misato continued, squeezing her.  
“没错。我敢肯定他现在正在梦见你。”美里继续说着，紧紧地握着她的手。

"Yeah. Maybe," she replied, an odd, awkward smile flittering across her face like a rainbow after the storm.  
“是的。也许吧。”她回答道，一抹奇怪而尴尬的微笑在她脸上闪过，就像暴风雨后的彩虹一样。

"Now let's go see him, shall we?"  
“现在让我们去看他，好吗？”

"Yeah." “是的。”

"And you save those tears for when he wakes up, okay?"  
“把眼泪留着等他醒来的时候，好吗？”

Asuka really smiled then, for the first time that night since coming home. It was strained but, it was genuine too.  
明日香真的微笑了，这是她回家后那个晚上第一次。虽然有点勉强，但也是真心的。

"Yeah, I guess that would be... nice."  
“是的，我想那会很... 不错。”

_If she stays like this, it really may be the best thing for Shinji to wake up to. I hope she does. For the both of them.  
如果她保持这样，对真嗣醒来来说可能是最好的事情。我希望她能。为了他们俩。_

_Ikariiiiiiiiii 碇——_

There had been a time once, when he had sunken into a darkness so deep and so profoundly empty that the only thing left in all of it was himself. In the belly of an Angel from an era so far gone to him now that even the memories seemed to be nothing more than an odd dream. It was as he sat and waited in the cold oblivion of the Entry Plug and the hours of his life support ticked away and stretched into infinities. Alone and trembling in that darkness Shinji began to confront the harsh realities of the hatred he bore for his father, things he had sealed away in his fragile self for so long.  
曾经有一段时间，他沉入了一种深邃而空虚的黑暗之中，那里只剩下他自己。在一个对他来说早已逝去的时代的天使腹中，即使是记忆似乎也不过是一个奇怪的梦境。当他坐在进入塞的寒冷混沌中等待，他生命支持系统的时间一分一秒地流逝，延伸至无尽。在那黑暗中独自颤抖，新吉开始直面他对父亲的仇恨，这些东西他长久以来封存在自己脆弱的内心深处。

The conflicting memories of his mother's disappearance. His subsequent abandonment. A train wreck of a childhood that spiraled out of control once Yui had left him. Her face, he had assumed forgotten, lay hidden with all these other awful things, like a glowing light in the midst of so much darkness. It all came crashing down on him in those hopeless moments as he waited for death to take him away. Confined. Alone. And embroiled in a battle essentially between himself and himself. A war he could not win.  
母亲消失的冲突记忆。随后的被遗弃。一段在伊吕离开后失控的童年。他曾以为已经遗忘的她的面孔，与所有这些其他可怕的事情一样隐藏其中，如同黑暗中的一束光芒。在那些绝望的时刻，当他等待死神带走他时，一切都向他坍塌。被困。孤独。卷入了一场实质上是他与自己之间的战斗。一场他无法赢得的战争。

_Ikariiiiiiiiii 碇——_

Now he was in this place again. Another unfamiliar ceiling in a life full of unfamiliar ceilings. Or was it that subway car? With this other self looking back at him. Whispering terrible things. Things he so desperately wished were not true.  
现在他又来到了这个地方。在充满陌生天花板的生活中又是一个陌生的天花板。或者是那辆地铁车吗？另一个自己正在看着他。低声说着可怕的事情。他如此渴望这些事情不是真的。

"Shinji, everything that happened that day. I understand it wasn't you doing that. An autopilot, right? You don't have to feel bad or anything. You couldn't stop it from happening. I said it after the accident. And I'd say it again today, even if I was still disabled."  
“真司，那天发生的一切。我知道那不是你的意愿。是自动驾驶，对吧？你不必感到难过或其他什么。你无法阻止那发生。事故发生后我就这么说了。即使我现在还残疾，今天我也会再次这么说。”

"I should have. Done something, though."  
“我本应该。做些什么的。”

_"Friends" are the things you find easiest to hurt  
“朋友”是你最容易伤害的东西_

Those cold blue eyes see only hate.  
那双冰冷的蓝眼睛只看到仇恨。

_It's your atonement for what you did to her  
这是你对她所做的赎罪。_

"Misato, I..." “美里，我……”

"You don't have to say anything, Shinji. You did the right thing that day. You saved my life."  
“不用说了，真司。那天你做了正确的事。你救了我的命。”

"I let you die too..."  
“我也让你死了……”

_So selfish, so weak 如此自私，如此软弱_

He kept the cross anyways. She wanted him to have it. She didn't say why. She just closed his hand around it and closed her arms around him.  
他还是留下了那枚十字架。她希望他留着它。她没有说原因。她只是把它放在他的手中，然后抱住了他。

_You never could do the right thing, could you  
你从来就做不对的事情，是吧_

"Shinji, Rei gave herself up for you. Not because she had to. Because she _wanted_ to. You're going to have to stop beating yourself up about it at some point."  
真嗣，丽为了你而牺牲。不是因为她不得不这样做。而是因为她愿意。你总有一天得停止自责。

"I know... I just—can't!"  
我知道…我只是—做不到！

_What a waste 真是个浪费_

The hand brushed over his cheek and the trance was over. Images of Unit 03's neck snapped in his hands came floating back over the haze. Only he was doing it now, not Unit 01. He was doing it to her.  
手掌划过他的脸颊，催醒了他。Unit 03 的脖子在他手中扭曲的画面重新浮现在脑海中。只不过这次是他在做，而不是 Unit 01。是他在对她做这一切。

_Killlllllllllllllllllllllll herrrrrr  
杀掉她_

"We know how hard it was, Shinji. You should be proud. You gave us all—here at NERV and everywhere else in the world—you gave us all another chance. Thanks to you."  
“我们知道这有多困难，真司。你应该感到自豪。你给了我们所有人——在 NERV 和世界各地的人——你给了我们所有人另一个机会。多亏了你。”

"I still feel bad. For all the people who won't take that chance."  
"我还是感到内疚。为了所有不敢冒险的人们。"

"That's because you're a good soul."  
"那是因为你是个善良的灵魂。"

_Can't you do anything right  
你什么事都做不对_

"You left me to die... While they ate me. _Ate_ Me! How could you do that to me, Shinji? How could you just sit there and... let me die?"  
"你让我去死……他们却吃掉了我。吃掉了我！你怎么能这样对我，真司？你怎么能坐在那里……看着我死？"

"Oh God, Asuka. I'm sorry... I'm so sorry. Please just. Forgive. Me."  
"天啊，明日香。对不起……我很抱歉。请原谅我。"

_How could you, how could you, how could you, how could you  
你怎么能，你怎么能，你怎么能，你怎么能_

_let me die die die die die die die die die  
让我死死死死死死死死死死_

"That's not true! I didn't let you die! I loved you!"  
"这不是真的！我没有让你死！我爱过你！"

_Who are you talking to, Ikariiiii  
你在跟谁说话，碇 iii_

"Asuka. Me. You. Whoever this is. I'm sick of you."  
"明日香。我。你。不管这是谁。我受够了。"

_Why did you do those things  
你为什么要做那些事_

"You don't exist! You do _not_ exist!"  
"你不存在！你根本不存在！"

_I don't? 我不？_

"—exist!" “—存在！”

_Then neither do you 那么你也不存在_

"That's not true." “那不是真的。”

_What's the point, this is inseparable from you  
有什么意义，这与你密不可分_

"Stop! Why can't you just stop?"  
“停下！为什么你就不能停下？”

_Guilt, Shinji, never ends  
内疚，真司，永无止境_

"Please..." “请……”

_This is yours 这是你的_

"No, I can't. I can't live like this. Anymore. I won't."  
"不，我不能。我不能再这样生活。再也不行。"

-Then stop.- -那就停下来吧。-

_What_

"Ayanami?" "绫波？"

-This isn't necessary, Shinji.-  
-这不是必要的，真嗣。-

_He cannot escape it 他无法逃避_

-Yes you can. It's just a trick.-  
-是的，你可以。这只是一个技巧。-

"Ayanami? Is that you?" “绫波？是你吗？”

_No, don't listen to her  
不，不要听她的话_

"It is you! Rei..." “是你啊！Rei…”

-Are you ready to let go?-  
-你准备好放手了吗？-

_It's a trick, don't listen to her  
这是个把戏，不要听她的_

"Is it scary?" “这是吓人的吗？”

-Yes. But it is better... than this.-  
-是的。但这样会更好...胜过这个.-

_No, you don't want to leave this  
不，你不想离开这里_

"What is this?" "这是什么？"

-This is you. This is you running away from pain.-  
-这是你。这是你逃避痛苦的样子。-

_This is easier 这更容易_

"If I stop it, will it be hard?"  
“如果我停下来，会很难吗？”

-Yes. But this will end as well. You want that, correct?-  
-是的。但这也会结束。你想要这样，对吧？-

_You can't do it 你做不到_

"I just. Don't want to be alone."  
"我只是。不想一个人。"

-You don't have to be.-  
- 你不必这样。-

_Liar! She's lying 骗子！她在撒谎_

"How?" “怎么了？”

-Just change your mind.- -只要改变你的想法。-

"Okay." "好的。"

_You cannooooo  你不可以_

"—I don't want... to be alone, anymore."  
“我不想…再一个人了。”

"Shinji?" “真嗣？”

"That's not Ayanami. Misato? No. Asuka?"  
“那不是绫波。美里？不对。明日香？”

"You can call me Nakamura, commander," the young woman introduced herself to her superior and the disheveled looking girl clasped safely under the woman's arm.

She'd never met either the commander or any of the pilots for that matter, having transferred into NERV post-impact. Her first impressions were not entirely what she had expected either. The commander hardly looked any older than herself, which was saying quite a bit given that she'd just turned twenty-six last month.  
她从未见过指挥官，也没有见过任何飞行员，因为她是在冲击之后调入 NERV 的。她的第一印象并不完全符合她的预期。指挥官看起来几乎和她一样年轻，这可不得了，考虑到她上个月刚刚满 26 岁。

The lavender hair was thrown over her black leather jacket in a manner that made her appearance look all the more "fresh out of college." She was a beautiful woman, just as she had heard from many of her co-workers, tall and well-proportioned. Perhaps if Nakamura hadn't respected this woman so much, if they had been in different circumstance—passing each other on the street—she might have been envious of the full lips and large breasts that she seemed quite willing to show off given her outfit. But now they just made her all the more in awe of this incredible woman, Operations Director against the rise of the Angels. It was hard to believe a woman maybe no more than four years her senior had already accomplished so much.  
淡紫色的头发披在她的黑色皮夹克上，使她看起来更像是“刚刚大学毕业”。她是一位美丽的女人，正如她从许多同事那里听到的那样，高挑而匀称。也许如果中村没有如此尊敬这位女士，如果情况不同——在街上擦肩而过——她可能会嫉妒那满嘴丰唇和丰满胸部，鉴于她的着装，她似乎很愿意展示这些。但现在，这些特质只让她更加敬畏这位不可思议的女人，作为对抗使徒崛起的运营总监。很难相信一个也许只比她大四岁的女人已经取得了如此多的成就。

The second child, on the other hand, looked like a shadow of the fiery, red-headed foreigner she'd heard stories about. Her posture was barely upright so that her glowing bangs concealed most of the detail of her face behind a swirl of silky red. While her body easily could have been that of a ballerina's, her slender legs slunk so that she drooped like a waning candle by the commander's side. Her arms hung limp by her sides, while she kept her gaze aimed firmly at the floor and stood beside (or under) the imposing commander.  
另一方面，二女儿看起来像是她听说过的那位火红头发的外国人的影子。她的姿势几乎挺直，让她那闪亮的刘海遮住了大部分脸部细节，只露出一抹丝绸般红色。虽然她的身体很容易被认为是芭蕾舞者的，但她纤细的双腿垂下，让她像指挥官身边一个燃烧殆尽的蜡烛。她的双臂垂在身体两侧，目光始终牢牢地朝着地板，站在（或者说是躲在）那位威严的指挥官身旁。

"Ritsuko informed me you will be taking us to Shinji's room, Dr. Nakamura. She spoke very highly of you," Katsuragi responded.  
“中村博士，瑛莲子告诉我你会带我们去真嗣的房间。她对你评价很高，”葛城回答道。

The younger woman blushed furiously underneath brunette bangs, aiming her gaze squarely at Misato's feet and the linoleum of the NERV hospital main entrance.  
年轻女子脸庞在深褐色刘海下涨红，目光直视着美里的脚和 NERV 医院主入口的油毡。

"Oh, um, well that was very kind of her. I hope my abilities will live up to expectations," she said, feeling her face flush even deeper.  
“哦，嗯，那真是她的好意。我希望我的能力能达到期望，”她说着，感到自己的脸更加发烫。

She caught Misato's soft features watching her with mild satisfaction from the corner of her eye as she returned upright from another customary bow.  
她感觉到美里软软的面容从眼角处微微满意地看着她，当她从另一个惯例的鞠躬中站直起来时。

"I'm sure they will." “我相信它们会的。”

Nakamura stared at them, deer in the headlights.  
中村盯着他们，像是被车灯照到的鹿一样。

"Oh dear, here I am congratulating myself instead of taking you to see him. Please excuse my rudeness," she said, turning. "This way, please."  
“哦，亲爱的，我竟然在自我祝贺而不是带你去见他。请原谅我的失礼，”她说着转身。“这边请。”

She led them to the elevators. When they began to descend the slumping pilot finally released the unbreakable silence she'd kept. Her voice was resilient yet remarkably thin and tired sounding.
她带着他们走向电梯。当他们开始下降时，那位疲惫的飞行员终于打破了她一直保持的沉默。她的声音坚定而又异常疲惫。

"Is he okay?" she blurted out. Asuka would not look up nor shift from her place by Misato's side.  
“他还好吗？”她脱口而出。明日香不愿抬头，也不愿离开身旁的美里。

"Physically speaking, he's very safe, Miss Souryu," Nakamura began, hesitant to use a first name. She bent over to catch a glimpse of the girl's face only to be startled as she suddenly looked up at her, and thrust from underneath that red storm of hair leapt two bright blue-eyes that gleamed—gleamed with the sort of desperation she'd seen in mothers and fathers asking of their sick children.  
“从生理上来说，他非常安全，想要使用名字的话，碰碰瓜先生，” 中村开始说，犹豫是否该用名字。她弯下腰，想看一眼女孩的脸，却被她突然抬起头来吓了一跳，从那一头红发的风暴下跃出两只闪亮的蓝眼睛—那眼神闪烁着一种绝望，她曾在问及他们生病孩子情况的父母眼中见过的绝望。

It was an astonishingly intense face for a girl her age. What Ritsuko had said certainly seemed to ring true. The two had grown close in some ways from their time spent piloting together.  
对于一个她这个年龄的女孩来说，她的表情异常强烈。莉茨子所说的似乎确实如她所言。两人在一起驾驶机体的时间里，在某些方面变得更加亲近。

"I'm not a medical doctor, I have my PhD in psychology actually, but what the doctors have told me is that he should be back to normal health in a little under twenty-four hours."  
"我不是医生，实际上我有心理学博士学位，但医生告诉我的是他应该在不到二十四小时内恢复正常健康。"

"Really?" the girl responded, relief flooding into the shocking eyes as a deep sigh escaping her parched, cracked lips and she looked away; Misato squeezed her a little tighter beside her.  
"真的吗？"那女孩回答道，松了口气，震惊的眼睛里充满了安慰，干裂的嘴唇发出深深的叹息，她把目光移开；身旁的美里紧紧地搂着她。"

"Other than a scar or two, yes, really."  
"除了一两处疤痕，是真的。"

The elevator dinged pleasantly as they reached his floor. The three of them stepped out together into to the utterly empty floor, reserved on short notice for the former pilot. Asuka spoke again slowly as they started their march down the white-washed hallway. The fluorescent bulbs overhead highlighted more clearly tear-streaked cheeks and a pale complexion.  
电梯发出愉快的叮当声，当他们到达他的楼层时。三人一起走出电梯，来到这个完全空无一人的楼层，临时为这位前飞行员保留。随着他们开始沿着白色走廊前行，明亮的荧光灯突显出更清晰的泪痕和苍白的面色。

"What about him, personally I mean. If you're a psychologist, do you think he'll be... the same?"  
“那他呢，我是指他个人。如果你是心理学家，你觉得他会……还是以前的那个人吗？”

Nakamura concealed a tiny frown behind a small nodding of her head, quickly glancing at the clip board of notes she'd had firmly pressed against her chest until now. It was a summarization of his personal file from NERV compiled by Dr. Akagi. And it was two pages full of more trauma than she'd seen in most of her career.  
中村在微微点头的同时掩饰了一丝不悦，迅速地瞥了一眼她一直紧贴在胸前的笔记板。这是 NERV 由赤木博士编制的他的个人档案摘要。里面充满了比她职业生涯中见过的大部分创伤还要多的内容，整整两页。

"Well, if you mean psychologically..." Asuka nodded emphatically. "Psychologically speaking, unfortunately we have no way of knowing until he wakes up and speaks to me at least a little bit. What I can tell you is that, from what I understand, this behavior seems atypical of Shinji. While he was quite possibly depressed, one doesn't just decide to take their life one day without some serious circumstance or change in the person beforehand."  
“嗯，如果你是指心理方面的话……”明日香斩钉截铁地点头。“从心理学角度来看，不幸的是，除非他醒来和我说几句话，否则我们无法知道。我能告诉你的是，据我了解，这种行为似乎不太像是真希。虽然他很可能有抑郁症，但一个人不会在没有严重情况或在之前发生人格上的变化的情况下，突然决定结束自己的生命。”

Asuka nodded again, darkening and disappearing back into the red haze of her bangs; Nakamura watched as Misato rubbed the girl's shoulder in an almost motherly fashion, the woman's dark eyes focused forwards and grim features marring her attractive face. Realizing that now was not the time to be in any way negative, Nakamura continued and tread as lightly as she could.  
明日香再次点头，阴沉地消失在她红色刘海的阴影中；中村看着美里以一种近乎母性的方式揉着女孩的肩膀，她那双深邃的眼睛专注地望着前方，严肃的表情破坏了她那张吸引人的脸庞。意识到现在不是任何消极情绪的时候，中村继续尽量小心翼翼地说话。

"That said, suicide is a particularly unique syndrome, even amongst those who are depressed. It is often a response to a chemical imbalance in the brain rather than the result of a single event or problem. Neither you nor Misato should hold yourselves accountable for his actions in any way."  
“话虽如此，自杀是一种特别独特的综合症，即使在那些抑郁的人中也是如此。它往往是大脑化学物质失衡的反应，而不是单一事件或问题的结果。你和美里都不应该以任何方式为他的行为感到内疚。”

Misato sighed ever so slightly, and Nakamura cringed. She was being too technical. This was going terribly awry. At this rate, she'd be looking for jobs again by tomorrow.  
美里微微叹了口气，中村感到不安。她太过于技术化了。事情正在变得非常糟糕。按照这个速度，明天她就得重新找工作了。

"Can you. Make him better?" Asuka asked, soft but vivid pain entering the muted tones of her voice.  
“你能让他好起来吗？”明日香问道，声音柔和但充满了生动的痛苦。

Nakamura almost gulped at the question. She was really in trouble now if she couldn't say something good here. Misato watched Nakamura from the corner of her stern gaze aimed down the hall.  
中村几乎被这个问题吓到了。如果她不能说出什么好话来，那她真的麻烦了。美里从她那严厉的目光的角落里注视着中村，目光直指走廊的尽头。

"Asuka, I won't lie to you. Shinji may be a different person when he wakes up. Nothing I or any of the doctors can do now will change that."  
"明日香，我不会对你撒谎。当真妮醒来时，她可能会是另一个人。我或任何医生现在都无法改变这一点。"

Tears filled the edges of those striking blue eyes, and Nakamura found herself almost succumbing to the pain she knew the words meant for that girl as she spoke them. She forced herself to be honest.  
眼泪充满了那双惊人的蓝眼睛的边缘，中村几乎忍不住了解到她说这些话对那个女孩意味着什么痛苦。她强迫自己诚实地说。

"But what we do have, Asuka—what we do have is the chance to help him get better. I have that chance thanks to the doctors and paramedics. And, according to them, he has that chance thanks to you."  
"但是，明日香，我们拥有的是帮助他康复的机会。我有这个机会要感谢医生和护理人员。而根据他们的说法，他有这个机会要感谢你。"

"I... Thank you..." Asuka said, in what sounded like her real voice for the first time since she'd arrived. She leaned her head against Misato's side and the woman responded by clutching the girl even tighter.  
“我...谢谢你...” 阿斯卡说道，声音听起来像是她自从到达以来第一次用真实的声音说话。她把头靠在美里的身上，美里回应着更紧地抱住了女孩。

Misato nodded to Nakamura slightly after this exchange, a tiny light of relief filling her troubled features as if someone was letting the air out of a tire that had been too full for too long. No doubt the night was taking its toll on the commander too; she was his legal guardian after all. And judging by the file, perhaps much more than that.  
在这番交流之后，美里微微向中村点了点头，一丝宽慰之光填满了她忧虑的面容，就像有人在放掉一个装气太满的轮胎的气一样。毫无疑问，这个夜晚也对指挥官造成了影响；毕竟她是他的法定监护人。而根据档案来看，也许她对他的影响远不止于此。

"Here we are," the shrink stated, stopping in front of the door.  
“我们到了，”心理医生说着，停在门前。

Asuka bolted from Misato's grip, nearly plowing into the nurse inside before leaping onto the bed and wrapping herself around Shinji in one fluid motion. The door had not even swung back shut before she began whispering into the sleeping boy's ear, clutching him tightly from beneath the sheets. The bewildered nurse seemed on the verge of a reprimand but left quietly with a nod from Misato. She smiled, or did her best despite the circumstance, watching the door close again from besides Nakamura.  
明日香从美里的手中挣脱出来，差点撞到里面的护士，然后一下子跳上床，用一种流畅的动作紧紧地搂住了真司。门还没关上，她就开始对睡着的男孩耳语，从被子下面紧紧地抱住他。那位困惑的护士似乎快要责备她，但在美里点头示意后静静地离开了。她微笑了，或者尽管情况不妙，她尽力微笑着，看着门再次被中村关上。

"Perhaps the only good thing to come of this," the commander began. "Is that it's finally let Asuka come to terms with her feelings for him." She sighed in a way that sounded satisfied rather than tired.  
“也许唯一的好事是，”指挥官开始说。“是它终于让明日香接受了她对他的感情。”她叹了口气，听起来满意而不是疲倦。

"Ritsuko had indicated some sort of possible relationship between them—"  
“莉茨子曾暗示过他们之间可能存在某种关系——”

"Oh they've been after each other since the first day they met, they just didn't really ever know it," Misato interrupted, making the same awkward smile at the doctor. "By the way, I really appreciate what you said to Asuka. I think she needed to hear it from someone other than me. She's had this big guilt complex about all of this just because she kissed this other boy today to try and make Shinji jealous or something like that. I think she was under the impression this was all because of her."  
“哦，他们从第一天见面开始就互相追逐，只是他们从来没有真正意识到，” 美里打断道，对医生露出同样尴尬的微笑。“顺便说一句，我真的很感激你对明日香说的话。我觉得她需要从别人那里听到。她一直因为今天她吻了另一个男孩试图让真司吃醋之类的事情而感到内疚。我觉得她误以为这一切都是因为她。”

Nakamura's brow rose fractionally.  
中村微微挑起眉毛。

"Ah, I see. Thank you, commander. But everything I said to Asuka was in earnest. She really did save his life today."  
“啊，我明白了。谢谢，指挥官。但我对明日香说的一切都是真心的。她今天确实救了他的命。”

"I know it was. That's what I appreciate about you good shrinks. You don't bullshit anyone after hearing other people's bullshit for so long," she replied, nudging the doctor good-naturedly with her elbow.  
“我知道的。这就是我欣赏你这些优秀心理医生的地方。在听了别人的废话之后，你们不会再对任何人说废话。”她笑着用手肘友好地戳了一下医生。

"Oh, uh, I guess I'll take that as a compliment," Nakamura said after a moment, smiling at the other woman.  
“哦，嗯，我想我会把这当作是一种赞美，”中村在片刻后说道，微笑着看着另一个女人。

"Damn right you will, seeing as I'm your commander," Misato cautioned.  
“当然，你会的，因为我是你的指挥官，”美里警告道。

Nakamura turned pallid in an instant.  
仅仅一瞬间，中村脸色苍白了。

"Just kidding!" Misato exclaimed, winking at the other woman.  
“开玩笑的！”美里喊道，对着另一个女人眨眼。

Nakamura did her best to laugh along, somewhat uneasily.  
中村尽力跟着笑，有些不安地笑了笑。

"Oh my, Ritsuko must have been telling you some awfully scary things about me, I suppose," Misato pondered, placing her finger upon her chin as she gazed thoughtfully into one of the fluorescent bulbs.  
“哎呀，律子一定跟你说了一些关于我的可怕事情，我想。” 美里思考着，手指搁在下巴上，凝视着一个荧光灯管。

"Eh, er, oh... oh dear," was all she could manage, her face returning to a fraction of its paleness from before. Dr. Akagi and Commander Katsuragi were both technically her boss, and she knew she would offend either one of them with any sort of answer to that statement.  
“诶，呃，哦... 天啊，” 她只能这么说，脸色重新苍白了一些。赤木博士和葛城指挥官都算是她的上司，她知道无论怎么回答那个问题都会得罪其中一个。

Misato chuckled again, stretching her arms out above her head in the air.  
美里再次笑了起来，伸展双臂，高高举过头顶。

"I like you. Let's get a drink together, I could really use to be a little less sober at the moment," she said suddenly.  
“我喜欢你。我们一起喝一杯吧，我现在真的需要放松一下，少那么清醒，”她突然说道。

"Well..." Nakamura contemplated the dangers of getting trashed with the most powerful woman in Japan.  
“嗯…” 中村考虑着与日本最强大的女人一起喝醉的危险性。

"Come onnn, I need this!" she said, grabbing the doctor by the wrist.  
“拜托啦，我需要这个！”她说着，抓住医生的手腕。

"Well she did mention this about you," Nakamura said uneasily, as Misato lead her by the hand back down the hall, laughing at the remark.  
“她确实提到了你这件事，”中村不安地说道，当美里牵着她的手回到走廊时，笑着对这番话感到好笑。

Misato grinned as they strode towards the tiny lounge of the floor, suddenly so much brighter than she'd been before.  
当她们朝着这层楼的小休息室走去时，美里露出了笑容，突然间比之前更加明亮起来。

"Ritsu knew me in my college years so she's probably seen the worst of me. I was a real hellion back then," she said, momentarily lost in her revelry. "How about yourself? I bet you drove the boys wild, eh?"  
“律子在我大学时代认识我，所以她可能见过我最糟糕的一面。那时的我真是个恶魔，”她说着，一时陶醉其中。“你呢？我敢打赌你当年一定让男孩们疯狂，对吧？”

Nakamura found herself blushing for the second time in front of her commander.  
中村发现自己第二次在指挥官面前脸红了。

"Eh, no, not really... I think I scared them all away."  
“嗯，不是的…我觉得我把他们都吓跑了。”

"Why's that?" Misato prodded, still in high spirits.  
“为什么？” 美里问道，依然情绪高涨。

"I understood them too well. The ones who just wanted my body. Well they didn't stand a chance obviously. And the one's that wanted a real relationship were always freaked out by how I could tell when they were lying to me."  
"我太了解他们了。那些只想要我的身体的人。显然他们没有机会。而那些想要真正关系的人总是被我能察觉到他们对我的谎言感到恐慌。"

"Man I wish I'd had you around when I was in college," Misato continued, almost sounding serious.  
""我真希望我在大学时有你在身边，"" 美里继续说道，几乎听起来很认真。

Nakamura laughed at this comment somewhat genuinely.  
中村对这个评论有些真诚地笑了起来。

"I take it you had lots of suitors in your college years?" she asked her superior tentatively.  
“我猜你大学时代应该有很多追求者吧？”她小心翼翼地问她的上司。

"Eh... no, not really, just one particularly troublesome one," the commander replied, an air of something wistful sneaking its way into her tone. She smiled to herself at some memory coming back into focus at the moment.  
“嗯... 其实不是的，只有一个特别让人头疼的人而已，”指挥官回答道，一丝怀旧的情绪悄然蔓延在她的语调中。她对着某个记忆微微一笑。

"What happened?" Nakamura continued, suddenly intrigued by this new side of the woman she did not seem to know at all.  
“发生了什么事？”中村继续问道，突然被这位她似乎完全不了解的女人展现出来的新一面所吸引。

"He... disappeared," she said and the smile faded in the instant, drawing on some darker place.  
“他...消失了，”她说道，微笑瞬间褪去，似乎触及了某个更黑暗的地方。

"Oh... I'm sorry to hear that. Oh gosh, here I am, turning my boss into another one of my patients! Sorry, I ask a lot of questions. Sort of a habit of my profession I suppose."  
“哦...听到这个消息我感到很抱歉。天啊，我怎么又把我的老板变成了我的另一个病人！抱歉，我问了很多问题。我想这可能是我这个职业的习惯吧。”

"Not at all," Misato waved her away as they entered the white (as if it would be any other color) upholstery of the hospital lounge.  
“一点也不，”美里托挥手示意她离开，当他们走进医院休息室的白色（仿佛还会是其他颜色一样）软垫时。

But NERV hospital, even if it was just a hospital, could be classy when it wanted to, maybe even luxurious. For all of the money spent of the state of the art equipment of the facility, since it was housed underneath the city, there was also an effort to give the place a "comfy feel." This particular spot, for instance, had the name of "The Pearl" as if to imply its white décor was some choice of the designer—perhaps it even was, though it bore and odd resemblance to the shade of the hallway and just about everything else in the place.  
NERV 医院，即使只是一家医院，也可以在需要时变得高档，甚至豪华。尽管在这家设施的最先进设备上花费了大量资金，因为它位于城市地下，但也有努力让这个地方有一种“舒适感”。比如，这个特定的地点，例如，被命名为“珍珠”，好像在暗示它的白色装饰是设计师的选择之一——也许甚至是，尽管它与走廊和这个地方的几乎一切东西都有一种奇怪的相似之处。

A few couples and off-work colleagues conversed in hushed tones to one another at various spots in the place over the cool rhythms and melodies of some modern jazz ensemble. The laidback atmosphere almost evaporated as the staffers' eyes bulged when they caught site of Misato and her sitting down together; their supreme commander was sitting down, a few seats away from them, at the place they supposed to be were relaxing in. Even a few of the patients seemed to recognize her, excited grins sneaking into their expressions. The waiter was practically beside himself as he approached the table.  
几对情侣和下班同事们在这个地方的各个角落低声交谈，而现代爵士乐团的凉爽节奏和旋律在背景中响起。当工作人员看到美里和她坐在一起时，这种悠闲的氛围几乎消失了；他们的最高指挥官坐在他们准备放松的地方的几个座位之外。甚至一些患者似乎认出了她，兴奋的笑容悄悄地出现在他们的表情中。服务员几乎要抓狂地走向这张桌子。

"Mi—Mi—Miss, I mean, uh, Co—Commander Katsuragi, uh, oh, what a pleasant surprise for you to, ah, stop by," he stuttered, practically sloshing their glasses of water over the two of them as he set them down at the table.  
“小—小—小姐，我是说，啊，卡—卡图拉吉指挥官，啊，你来，嗯，真是个惊喜。”他结结巴巴地说着，几乎把他们的水杯溅到了两人身上，然后把杯子放在桌子上。

"At ease solider," Misato said, making a mock-salute and wink. Her face turned deadly serious then. "Two Gin and Tonics. On the rocks. No straw for me. And don't give us any of that shit Gin. Something nice. Something imported. Oh, and a round for everyone else of whatever they want." The heightened whispers and tense air dissipated in a snap, like the whole room had taken a collective sigh. This wasn't a surprise inspection or worse, she was, for the time being, just looking to get smashed like they were.  
“放松，士兵。”美里说着，做了一个模拟敬礼并眨眼。她的脸色突然变得严肃起来。“两杯金汤力。加冰。我不要吸管。不要给我们那些烂东西的金酒。来点好的。进口的。哦，其他人想要什么就给他们来一轮。”紧张的低语和紧张的气氛瞬间消散，就像整个房间都在共同叹息。这不是一次突击检查，更糟糕的是，她只是想像他们一样喝个痛快。

"Is it like this everywhere you go?" Nakamura asked quietly, sipping at her water as the anxious stares dissipated.  
“你走到哪里都是这样吗？”中村安静地问道，一边小口喝着水，焦虑的目光渐渐消散。

"Eh, more or less yeah. I tend to blend away more in the city, but any NERV facility is like... well, I'd be less obvious in my unmentionables," she replied.  
“嗯，多多少少吧。我在城市里更容易融入，但任何 NERV 设施就像……嗯，我穿着内衣可能更不起眼，”她回答道。

Nakamura smiled at the joke, briefly considering her commander's breast size. The thought made her both uneasy and at the same time happy that Misato was, more or less, practically still a college grad like herself.  
中村对这个笑话微笑，短暂地考虑了一下她指挥官的胸围。这个想法让她感到不安，但同时也让她开心，因为美里基本上还像她自己一样是个大学毕业生。

"Is it hard? Being so... idolized by everyone?"  
“被所有人如此……崇拜，是不是很难受？”

"Not really now-a-days. I'm sure Gendou had it a lot worse than I ever did. But then he probably got off on that kind of thing..." Misato trailed off, impatiently looking around for their cocktails.  
“现在不是这样了。我敢肯定根豆比我遭遇的要糟糕得多。不过他可能对那种事情感到兴奋……” 美里说着，不耐烦地四处寻找他们的鸡尾酒。

"Commander Ikari. Shinji's father, yes?"  
“碇指挥官。是新吉的父亲，对吧？”

Misato nodded. 美里点了点头。

"The one and only I'm afraid."  
唯一的一个，我害怕。

Nakamura found herself treading lightly again.  
中村发现自己又开始小心翼翼地行动起来。

"The files I was given by Ritsu—I mean, Dr. Akagi, said they had a rather... tense relationship," Nakamura spoke, catching herself from almost informally referring to her boss.  
“我从律—我是说，阿凯基博士那里得到的文件显示他们之间关系相当紧张，”中村说道，差点忘了不应该非正式地提到她的老板。

"More like dysfunctional," Misato sighed.  
“更像是功能失调的，”美里叹了口气。

"That is a word we use very carefully in my profession. What do you mean, dysfunctional, commander?" Nakamura asked.  
“这是我在我的职业中非常谨慎使用的词汇。你说的，功能失调，指挥官是什么意思？”中村问道。

"Well I'm sure your report has the cut and dry on him, but if you're going to be evaluating him you might as well get the full story. I met Shinji, for the first time really, when the third Angel came stomping out of the Pacific..."  
“嗯，我相信你的报告对他有详细的描述，但如果你要评估他，最好了解全貌。我第一次真正见到新吉，是当第三使徒从太平洋中踏步而出的时候…”

She could not stop whispering to him. She had to confess it all. All of the feelings. All of the things she had found herself wanting to say over the course of this year. Maybe since even before then. All of it came out like a sinner's whisper to a priest, complete with the complimentary guilt. She apologized for the mean things she'd said. All the times she'd teased him. All of the times she had hurt him physically or otherwise. And a whole host of them about Fukai.

And in between the "sorry"s there were the "I like you"s, the "I care about you"s, and even an "I love you" somewhere in there. She told him her true intentions that day. She explained why she had tried to hurt his feelings so many times, why she had done and said all the nasty things she did. And most of all, why he had to live. To give her a second chance.  
在“对不起”的措辞之间，夹杂着“我喜欢你”、“我在乎你”，甚至还有一句“我爱你”藏在其中。那天她告诉他她的真实意图。她解释了为什么她曾试图伤害他的感情那么多次，为什么她说了做了那些讨厌的事情。最重要的是，为什么他必须活下去。给她一个第二次机会。

All of these things she whispered into the early morning hours in the as she lay under the sheets with him, more intimate than she could ever remember being. And when she had run out of things to say she simply held him, and felt his chest push against her arm with every breath, cherishing the sensation.  
所有这些她在清晨的时光里对着他耳语，当她躺在被窝里时，比她记忆中任何时候都更亲密。当她无话可说时，她只是简单地拥抱着他，感受着他每一次呼吸时胸膛对她手臂的压迫，珍惜着这种感觉。

As the warmth of their bodies pressed together connected them and the minutes passed she found herself drifting away into sleep along side him. That's when the murmurs started. Soft, unintelligible at first. Then painful. Desperate.  
随着他们身体的温暖相互贴近，随着时间的流逝，她发现自己在他身边渐渐入睡。那时 murmurs 开始了。一开始是轻柔的、难以理解的。然后变得痛苦。绝望。

"It's okay," she cooed to him. "It's just a nightmare."  
“没关系，”她对他轻声说道。“只是个噩梦而已。”

But he wouldn't stop. 但他就是停不下来。

They kept coming, every minute or so. Another mumbled something. Sometimes fear. Mostly sad. And then.  
它们不停地出现，每隔一会儿。另一个喃喃自语着什么。有时是恐惧，大多是悲伤。然后。

"Oh God, Asuka." “天啊，明日香。”

She sat up at the name, eyes wide. She stared at him now. Had he heard her sweet nothings? Had he really been awake this whole time? Tricking her?  
一听到这个名字，她坐了起来，瞪大了眼睛。她现在盯着他看。他听到了她的甜言蜜语吗？他真的一直醒着吗？骗她？

"I'm sorry... I'm so sorry."  
“对不起…我很抱歉…我真的很抱歉。”

No. He twitched under her, still asleep. And tears spilled out of his closed, oblivious eyes onto the pillow.  
不。他在她身下抽搐，依然沉睡着。眼泪从他闭着的、毫不知情的眼睛中流出，滴在枕头上。

"Please just. Forgive. Me."  
“请。原谅。我。”

She found herself almost crying with him.  
她发现自己几乎和他一起哭了起来。

"No," she whispered. "It's not your fault. Whatever it is. I forgive you."  
“不是的，”她轻声说道。“无论发生了什么。我原谅你。”

She clutched him tighter now, careful not to disturb him, yet firm in her affection. She wanted him to know. She had to make him know. When he woke up, she wanted to be so close that no matter how her head might try and stop her—no matter how embarrassed—she'd be right there with him. Unavoidably. Holding him. Waiting for him.  
她现在更紧紧地抱着他，小心翼翼地不想打扰他，但又坚定地表达她的爱。她想让他知道。她必须让他知道。当他醒来时，她希望能够如此亲近，无论她的头脑如何试图阻止她——无论多么尴尬——她都会在他身边。无法避免地。抱着他。等着他。

But before she could even lay back down, she watched as his eyes fluttered. Opening. Awake.  
但在她甚至能躺下之前，她看着他的眼睛眨动。睁开。清醒。

"Shinji..." “真嗣……”

"I—Asuka?" “我——明日香？”

"Shinji." She had told herself over and over again that she wouldn't cry. She had promised herself. But. "I'm sorry. Please, don't... don't ever leave me again. Not like this. Just not like this..."  
“真嗣。”她一遍又一遍告诉自己不会哭。她答应过自己。但是。“对不起。请，不要……不要再这样离开我。不要再这样……”

"Asuka..." “明日香……”

He returned the weeping girl's embrace semi-numbly, almost unwilling to believe he had woken up. He had to be dreaming again, he reasoned. Only the Asuka in his dreams would hold him like this. Only she would say those things. Only she would dare cry in front of him or actually apologize for anything. It couldn't be real. But he let it continue on, content—it was the happiest dream he'd ever had.  
他半麻木地回应着那个哭泣的女孩的拥抱，几乎不愿相信自己已经醒来。他必须又在做梦了，他这样推理着。只有他梦中的明日香才会这样拥抱他。只有她才会说那些话。只有她才敢在他面前哭泣，或者真正为任何事道歉。这不可能是真的。但他让这一切继续下去，心满意足——这是他做过的最幸福的梦。

He found himself in disbelief as the seconds became minutes. Total disbelief as they drifted off to sleep, together, finally together after so long. The worst/greatest day of his life.  
随着秒针变成分钟，他发现自己难以置信。当他们一起入睡时，完全难以置信，终于在这么长时间后再次在一起。这是他生命中最糟糕/最伟大的一天。

A/N: There it is. I think I left enough clues and enough mysteries to resolve well. Hopefully most of the angst seemed at least a little justitified/natural. The opening lyrics are from "The Beginning" by Nine Inch Nails which totally fit when taken out of context and which completely don't work when taken with the rest of the song. I was mostly listening to Radiohead when I edited this and Tool/NIN when I wrote it.

I'm really sorry for the delay. I could have had this out last week but I've been working my ass off for school recently. With my dad coming to visit me in Tokyo, the school year finishing up, and summer plans to be made I'm more busy than I expected.  
非常抱歉耽搁了。我本可以在上周完成这个的，但最近为了学校拼命工作。我爸爸要来东京看我了，学年即将结束，还有夏季计划要制定，我比预期更忙。

I hope you guys liked this story. I originally started it as the beginning of something much, much bigger. I'm not sure if I plan on adding to it any further and I've got another love right now called "A Thousand Years of Secrecy" that I simply cannot stop working on. Since I try and keep myself working on only one long piece at a time this is done for now, but who knows, we may see some more chapters out of this as yet. For now I'm not going to mark it complete just in case but I think you will agree that this is a nice place to end.  
希望你们喜欢这个故事。我最初打算将其作为更大更长篇的开头。我不确定是否打算进一步添加内容，我现在有另一个作品叫《千年秘闻》，我简直停不下来。因为我尽量一次只专注于一部长篇作品，所以这部现在告一段落了，但谁知道呢，也许我们会看到更多章节。目前我不会标记为完成，以防万一，但我想你会同意这是一个不错的结局。

Much love to all of the incredible reviews and criticisms. Look out for more short stuff when I have the ideas/time/motivation.  
非常感谢所有出色的评论和批评。等我有了新的想法/时间/动力时，敬请期待更多短篇作品。

Thanks for reading. 谢谢阅读。

### Comment
No offense man but this just isnt a good story... Everything happens out of nowhere, character motivations arent properly established, and everyone seems oddly out of character. The dialogue is stilted and the writing is confused and jumbled in some parts. I want to give you kudos for capturing some of the emotion well, but because the emotion didnt get a proper buildup, it felt poorly utilized. Its not a terrible story per se, just mediocre I guess.  
不冒犯，但这故事真的不怎么样……一切都突如其来，人物动机没有得到恰当的建立，每个人似乎都表现得很奇怪。对话生硬，写作在某些部分混乱而杂乱。我想表扬你成功捕捉到一些情感，但由于情感没有得到适当的铺垫，感觉利用不当。它并不是一篇糟糕的故事，只是一般般吧。

[jayseaaa](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/16271404/jayseaaa): Pretty hard, but good read. I really enjoyed seeing Shinji's reception toward's being in the limelight as his role as an evangelion pilot, especially one that has been whitewashed and sterilised. Shinji would not take that lightly at all, and I really enjoy seeing Shinji finally open his own emotions he hides from others, he can only let others tread on his passiveness and kindness for only so long until the bottle explodes. It hurts me to see Asuka this way, I can understand the frustrations of the only boy who could truly understand her and had mutual feelings for becoming a comatose doll for over a year and feel upset seeing others grossly misinterpret her character in the series labelling her as none other than a 'mean bitch'. But actively going out of her way to physically and verbally abuse him, specifically to inflict any kind of pain on him intentionally and making out with the man who absolutely despised Shinji and beat him sensless into a bloody mess made her a complete abusive asshole, even far more than NTE Asuka, who acts even more of a prick then NGE Asuka. This story reminds me of Scar-Tissue even though it was made much earlier. Until chapter 3 I could not think of her being anything more than a complete sadistic bitch in this story, lol.
相当沉重，但读起来很棒。我真的很喜欢看到真嗣作为福音战士驾驶员，尤其是被美化和平淡化的角色，在聚光灯下的反应。真嗣绝不会对此轻描淡写，我也很高兴看到他终于向他人敞开了自己隐藏的情感，他只能让别人的被动和善良践踏他，直到瓶子爆炸。看到明日香这样我很难过，我能理解唯一真正理解她并互有好感的男孩变成了一年多的植物人，看到别人严重误解她在剧中的角色，称她不过是个“刻薄婊子”，这让我感到沮丧。但主动去身体和言语上虐待他，特别是故意给他带来痛苦，并与那个绝对憎恨真嗣并把他打得血肉模糊的男人亲热，使她成了一个完全的虐待狂混蛋，甚至比NTE中的明日香还要糟糕，她的行为比NGE中的明日香还要恶劣。这个故事让我想起了《伤痕累累》，尽管它制作得更早。直到第三章，我都没法把她想成这个故事里除了一个完全的施虐婊子之外的任何角色，哈哈。
  
Now here's to hoping that Shinji eventually learned his lesson from EOE, composed himself and realising his own worth to himself and to others, honestly communicating and opening himself up to those most important to him, and when he finally accepts living in a world that has pain, he shows that pain directly to Fukai's pretty face with an EVA-01 Brandished baseball bat merchandise.  
希望真治最终从《新世纪福音战士》中吸取教训，冷静下来，意识到自己对自己和他人的价值，真诚地与那些对他最重要的人沟通并敞开心扉，当他最终接受生活中的痛苦时，用 EVA-01 品牌棒球棒商品直接向深井的俊俏脸庞展示那痛苦。  
  
- P.S - - 附言 -  
  
I do understand what everyone else is saying here, that post-EOE this would be very OOC for Shinji and Asuka, seeing as the entire point of the movie, and what the series had been leading up to was both of them finding a way to love themselves, and find a world to connect with one another despite the pain it may bring.  
我确实明白大家在这里说的话，即在《新世纪福音战士》完结后，这对真嗣和明日香来说会很不像他们，因为电影的整个重点，以及整个系列一直在引导的是他们找到一种爱自己的方式，找到一个世界让彼此联系，尽管这可能带来痛苦。  
  
Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut-  
不过——  
  
This is a fan-fiction! The whole point is to do whatever! exercise your pen, if you don't like the fic, then explain why you didn't like it rather than stating its 'OOC'.  
这是一部同人小说！整个重点就是做任何事情！发挥你的想象力，如果你不喜欢这篇小说，那就解释一下为什么不喜欢，而不是说它'不像原作'。

[Dragonjek](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1788632/Dragonjek) : Very well done. I think you caught the personalities of the characters very well, and I like how you set everything up so that it looks like things will end up all right (relatively speaking) without you having to write it all out.  
做得非常好。我认为你很好地抓住了角色的个性，我喜欢你如何安排一切，让一切看起来都会变得好起来（相对而言），而不必把所有事情都写出来。  
  
I also appreciate how the trauma was needed for Asuka to realize how she felt about Shinji, and I found the angsting rather appropriate throughout the entire thing. You had the typical Evangelion completely-misunderstanding-one-another-in-horrible-life-ruining-ways part nailed down.  
我也欣赏阿斯卡需要经历创伤才意识到自己对真嗣的感情，整个过程中的痛苦感觉相当恰当。你完全掌握了《新世纪福音战士》中彼此彻底误解、以毁灭性方式相处的部分。  
  
Like the story very much-and I like that, despite the pain and despair, there was still hope at the end.  
我很喜欢这个故事，尽管充满了痛苦和绝望，但最终仍然有希望。  
  
Which is as it should be.  
这就是应该的。

[GrizzlyBiscuit](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1084530/GrizzlyBiscuit): in all honesty, I don't think anything else needs to be added to this piece of literature. Yes, Shinji is still a broken person on the inside, and no one really knows what exactly happened out there at the forest where assumedly the blue reading came from at exactly the same time that Shinji touched the liquid, but who can be catagorized as being a whole and sane person?  
老实说，我认为这部文学作品不需要再添加任何内容了。是的，真嗣内心仍然是一个破碎的人，没有人真正知道在森林里发生了什么，据推测那里出现了蓝色读数，而真嗣正好接触到了那种液体，但谁能被归类为一个完整且理智的人呢？
People have to learn to move on with what they can do and what they can't do. Shinji has been stuck in his place of mourning that he couldn't move beyond the grief, which was detailed excellently. The recurrence of Asuka walking in on another person she cared for trying to or already having taken their life gave her the chance to realize what was in front of her and force her to accept that she also had to make a move.  
人们必须学会接受他们能做什么和不能做什么。真嗣一直沉浸在他的哀悼之地，他无法超越悲伤，这一点被详细地描绘得非常出色。明日香再次目睹她关心的人试图或已经结束了自己的生命，这让她有机会意识到眼前的事实，并迫使她接受自己也必须采取行动。
It would be interesting to see how Shinji would try to recover and become a person beyond who he is now, but in all honesty, anything associated with his past after his recovery would most likely cause a recurrence of this suicidal act and may drive him into a more desperate violent ending. In all probability, it would be one that even Section 2 could not stop him if he, say for instance, inexplicably threw himself into the path of an oncoming car just as it was passing him?  
看到真嗣如何尝试恢复并成为一个超越现在的自己的人会很有趣，但老实说，与他康复后相关的任何过去都可能导致这种自杀行为的复发，并可能将他推向一个更绝望的暴力结局。很可能，即使第二部门也无法阻止他，比如说，如果他在一辆车经过他时莫名其妙地跳到车前？
Living is rough, any person who has lived beyond their time knows this all too well. Not trying to live is beyond sad, and now Shinji can have the chance to begin to live again. Any person is their own angel or demon in the literal sense, hell is but a step away if we could but toss aside humanity and devour insanity.
生活是艰难的，任何活过自己时间的人都非常清楚这一点。不尝试生活是极其悲伤的，而现在真嗣有机会重新开始生活。任何人在字面意义上都是自己的天使或恶魔，如果我们能抛弃人性并吞噬疯狂，地狱不过是一步之遥。

[AlaskaSlim](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1005277/AlaskaSlim) : You, my friend, have done it! You’ve captured Shinji’s character almost perfectly! That’s quite a feat, let me tell you, I have much in common with him as a character, but even I can’t understand nor fully capture his thoughts in my writing. His thoughts of self-worth, his perception of Asuka’s feelings, the images of Misato and Rei streaming through his consciousness, everything! You got all, right on the dot! Even his attempted suicide doesn’t seem so farfetched if put into perspective, awesome work is all I can say.  
我的朋友，你做到了！你几乎完美地捕捉到了真嗣的性格！让我告诉你，我和真嗣这个角色有很多共同之处，但即使是我，也无法在我的笔下理解或完全捕捉到他的思想。他对自我价值的思考，他对明日香情感的感知，他意识中流淌的美里和玲的形象，一切的一切！你都写得很到位！我只能说，你写得太棒了！即使是他试图自杀，如果从这个角度来看，也不显得那么牵强了。  
  
Still though, while Shinji is himself, I can’t quite say the same with Asuka, she expresses her “feelings” a little too well, so much that I can’t imagine her saying some of the things she says in the final chapter (and I constantly listen to episodes 9-15 so I can properly imagine her, or rather, Tiffany Grant’s voice, along with the voices of the other characters). She also seemed to lack her normal malice in that same final chapter, in-fact, I noticed she never even once said “idiot, dummkopf, or stupid” in regards to Shinji. I realized it’s been a year since the “Angel Battles”, and that people can change a lot during that amount of time, but insulting Shinji is still something I would expect Asuka to do, if only out of habit instead of trying to salvage what is left of her “pride”.  
不过，虽然真嗣是他自己，但我对明日香却不敢恭维，她的 "感情 "表达得有点过了，以至于我无法想象她会说出最后一章中的某些话（我一直在听第 9-15 集，所以我能正确地想象她的声音，或者说，蒂芙尼-格兰特的声音，以及其他角色的声音）。在最后一章中，她似乎也没有了往常的恶意，事实上，我注意到她甚至从来没有对真嗣说过一次 "白痴、笨蛋或蠢货"。我意识到 "天使之战 "已经过去一年了，在这段时间里人可能会改变很多，但侮辱慎二仍然是我期待明日香会做的事情，如果只是出于习惯，而不是试图挽回她仅存的 "自尊 "的话。  
  
Misato is pretty well captured as well in this chapter, the emotional support, the pep talk, her comments towards the nurse, and even wanting to be a “…little less sober at the moment”, is her, without a doubt. However, at the same time, you seemed to have “personalized” her character a bit, first with the “What is it honey?” question (which I swear, I stared at for 3 minuets to make sure I wasn’t seeing things), and secondly with her drink request, “gin and tonic”, which seems just a little odd considering she is Japanese. Then again, we never know what kind of drinks she gets in bars, and Misato herself is more then just a little odd, so I wouldn’t put preferring foreign liquor past her, and way she asks for it is CERTAINTLY like her, still, the whole “honey” thing I think was going a bit too far.  
在这一章中，美里也被描写得很好，情感支持、鼓舞人心的谈话、她对护士的评论，甚至想要"......此刻不那么清醒"，毫无疑问都是她。然而，与此同时，你似乎有点 "个性化 "了她的性格，首先是 "亲爱的，这是什么？"这个问题（我发誓，我盯着这个问题看了三分钟，以确保我没有眼花），其次是她的饮料要求，"杜松子酒和奎宁水"，考虑到她是日本人，这似乎有点奇怪。话又说回来，我们从来不知道她在酒吧里会喝到什么样的酒，而美里本身也是个有点古怪的人，所以我不会把她喜欢喝外国酒的事放在心上，而她要酒的方式也确实很像她，不过，我还是觉得整个 "蜂蜜 "这件事有点太过分了。  
  
Anyway, that aside, awesome story all-around, capturing Shinji’s essence like that alone gives it 11 out of 10 in my book, can’t way to see your other work!  
总之，抛开这些不谈，你的故事非常棒，单单是抓住了真嗣的本质这一点，我就打了 11 分，我迫不及待地想看看你的其他作品！

[Fresh C](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/798429/Fresh-C): Great story. I must admit that at first i had planned on protesting your decision to leave this chapter as the end. There are a lot of unanswered questions, like did Asuka's actions really cause the suicide and did Shinji ever really get better? I have several unwriten scenes in my mind of Shinji talking to Nakamura about various unresolved problems and how awkwardly things would progress between Shinji and Asuka.  
很棒的故事。我必须承认，起初我打算抗议你将这一章作为结尾的决定。这一章有很多未解之谜，比如明日香的行为真的会导致自杀吗？我脑海中有几个未写完的场景，真嗣与中村谈论各种未解决的问题，以及真嗣与明日香之间的尴尬进展。  
  
But then I realized it's still good without those scenes. The story doesn't need them. Sure I'd like them (I'd like them a lot) but they are not necessary.  
但后来我意识到，没有这些场景，它依然很好看。故事并不需要它们。我当然会喜欢它们（我非常喜欢），但它们不是必需的。  
  
Overall you wrote an interesting story with an intruiging plot and good character descriptions. You could feel the plight of each character and understand everything going through their heads. My only minor complaint would be that of Asuka's complete 180 turn around in her feelings with total abandon of her usual disbelief. However, I understand that such an occurence is quite possible and my slight doubts of that particular turn out are really just a matter of preference.  
总的来说，你写了一个有趣的故事，情节引人入胜，人物描写也很到位。你能感受到每个人物的困境，理解他们脑子里所想的一切。我唯一有点不满的是，明日香的感情来了个180度大转弯，完全放弃了她一贯的不信任感。不过，我知道这种情况是很有可能发生的，我对这一结果的轻微怀疑其实只是个人喜好的问题。  
  
So once agian I must say good job and keep on writing. I'd like to read more of this story, but really it's not necessary to write more. I look forward to seeing more of "A Thousand Years of Secrecy" because that story rocks as well.  
所以，我必须再说一次，干得好，继续写下去。我想读更多这个故事，但真的没有必要写更多。我期待看到更多的 "千年秘密"，因为那个故事也很精彩。  
  
May your days be long upon the Earth and the fruit of your toils be bountiful.  
愿你们在地上的日子长久，愿你们的辛劳结出丰硕的果实。

[Verbl Kint 187](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/262867/Verbl-Kint-187): Well, I finally got around to reading your other work…this one. Not bad. Not bad and not good at the same time. Your writing isn’t at fault, but rather your choice of subject for the fic. Now that’s not entirely accurate…no, it’s not the subject matter directly, but rather your execution of the story. Preface to the review aside, I’m going to get started.  
我终于读到了你的其他作品......这本。还不错。不错，同时也不好。你的写作没有错，错的是你选择的小说主题。这样说不完全准确......不，不是直接的主题问题，而是你对故事的执行。抛开评论的前言，我要开始了。  
  
Point 1, Characterization: Insert my usual speech here about creative liberties and character templates, you’ve heard it before. I’ll save both of us some time and get right into the meat. Your characterization seems very in synch for the end of the series, especially for Shinji. Misato is good, no comment there. Asuka is where you kind of fall short. You focus a lot on her and really don’t give the reader a lot to work with. All we have are vague descriptions of what she may be plotting in the first chapter and then her follow through with the deed. And then after Shinji’s crisis, she starts bawling about how it’s all her fault. I’m gonna split this up into two parts. Part 1, you say a whole lot of nothing in the first chapter about Asuka’s plan. She’s planning something, but we don’t know what. Not until the end of the chapter anyway. I understand the point of trying to add to the suspense by giving the reader a “What could she be doing?” thing, but it is actually quite vague as to why she is doing it. It doesn’t become clear until the second chapter. Now, Part 2, is your consistency with the portrayal of Asuka’s character. The first part wouldn’t be that big of a deal if Asuka didn’t have her little guilt fest at the end. Up until she started feeling guilty, more specifically the scene where she went to apologize, she was a complete…wretched cunt? Yeah, that’s a good way to describe it. It was emphasized by your focus on her character and her character thoughts. The way she makes reference to Shinji isn’t exactly flattering, to put it lightly. And the tone that you set makes her actions seem more malevolent then good natured. I understand that perhaps you are trying to show how fucked in the head she is, but what you create is a little situation where I’m unsure as to what she really wants out of her little plan. In essence, what I’m getting at is there is no real warmth which is portrayed to warrant me believing that she actually feels the way she does about Shinji.  
第一点，人物塑造：在此插入我通常所说的创作自由和角色模板，你们已经听过了。我还是省点时间，直接进入正题吧。你的角色塑造似乎与系列结尾非常吻合，尤其是真嗣。美里很好，无可奉告。明日香是你的不足之处。你把很多精力都放在了她身上，却没有给读者提供很多素材。在第一章中，我们只是模糊地描述了她可能在密谋什么，然后她就开始行动了。然后在真嗣的危机之后，她开始嚎啕大哭，说这都是她的错。我要把这分成两部分。第一部分，你在第一章对明日香的计划说了一大堆废话。她在计划什么，但我们不知道是什么。总之，在这一章结束之前，我们都不知道。我明白你想通过给读者一个 "她会做什么？"来增加悬念，但对于她为什么要这么做，你其实说得很含糊。直到第二章才变得清晰起来。现在，第二部分是你对明日香这一角色的刻画是否前后一致。如果明日香在结尾没有内疚的话，第一部分就不会有那么大的问题。在她开始感到内疚之前，更确切地说，在她去道歉的那场戏中，她完全是个......可恶的荡妇？是的，这是个很好的描述方式。你对她的性格和思想的关注更加突出了这一点。轻描淡写地说，她提到真嗣的方式并不讨人喜欢。你所设定的基调让她的行为看起来更邪恶，而不是善良。 我明白，也许你是想表现出她的脑子有多混乱，但你所制造的小局面让我不确定她的小计划到底想要什么。从本质上讲，我想说的是，没有真正的温情来让我相信她对真嗣的感情。  
  
Point 2, Plot: Another point of contention. Perhaps I’m the only one who feels this, maybe because I’ve been around the community for such a long time (yeah, I’m a loser), but this plot has been done to death from just about 2001. It’s not new. But as I said, it’s probably only because I’ve been around so long. So take this with a grain of salt.  
第 2 点，情节：另一个争议点。也许只有我有这种感觉，也许是因为我在这个圈子混了这么久（是的，我是个失败者），但这个情节从 2001 年开始就已经被做烂了。这并不新鲜。但正如我所说，这可能只是因为我在这里呆的时间太长了。所以，请慎重考虑。  
  
Point 3, Theme: Your themes are solid and consistent. But my angst-o-meter went through the damn roof. Whoosh man, you could put emo kids to shame if you really tried. The theme is good though. Just be a little careful with it in the future, it can come off a little strong so that people might confuse Shinji with the Melancholy Dane.  
第 3 点，主题：你的主题扎实而连贯。但我的焦虑指数却高得吓人。如果你真的努力的话，你可以让情绪化的孩子们感到羞愧。不过主题还是不错的。只是以后要注意一点，可能会有点强烈，让人把真嗣和忧郁的丹麦人搞混。  
  
Point 4, Writing Style: Good writing. Solid writing. You got most of what you wanted accomplished. Really minor point, couple of careless slips with your POVs. It only happened twice if I recall correctly and they were really minor points. Point is, you can write. You have talent, which is rare in fanfiction in general. But it’s not polished yet, keep working at it.  
第 4 点，写作风格：写得不错。文笔扎实。你完成了大部分你想要的内容。有两处不经意的笔误，我没记错的话，只出现过两次。如果我没记错的话，只出现过两次，而且都是小问题。重点是，你能写。你有才华，这在一般的同人小说中是很少见的。但还不够完美，继续努力。  
  
Overall, decent stuff. There are a few small kinks and few big kinks that need working out, but nothing unmanageable. Keep it up.  
总的来说，还不错。有几个小问题和几个大问题需要解决，但没有什么不可收拾的。继续努力

[Adam Kadmon](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/819499/Adam-Kadmon): I'm getting some really dark vibes from this Asuka. I mean, really dark. Part of me hopes I'm wrong. The other part, namely, my creative side, can't wait to see the pain and destruction.  
这个明日香给我的感觉真的很黑暗。我是说，真的很黑暗。我的一部分希望我是错的。另一部分，也就是我的创造力，迫不及待地想看到痛苦和毁灭。  
  
A very interesting idea: post Impact, nearly everyone's back, things are returning to "normal" and Shinji's... still horribly depressed. Maybe it's the fact that I hate seeing him happy, but I like the basic set up of this fic. This facade of normalcy and happiness everyone wears, even after such an atrocious incident, is intriguing.  
一个非常有趣的想法："冲击 "之后，几乎所有人都回来了，一切都恢复了 "正常"，而真嗣......仍然非常沮丧。也许是因为我不喜欢看到他开心的样子，但我喜欢这篇小说的基本设定。即使在经历了如此残暴的事件之后，每个人表面上的正常和快乐还是很耐人寻味。  
  
Here's hoping Asuka's really crazier than she lets on.  
希望明日香真的比她自己说的还要疯狂。
