　　1
　　纷飞的思绪代替了彼时的宁静，不知已经过去了多久，我终于睁开了双眼。
　　*我最后记得的是什么呢？* 啊，我的思绪四处飘散，失去了现实的焦点，我想再闭上眼睛冥想一会，但我听到了美里和真嗣正在交谈——
　　在聊和我相关的话题。
　　我本想立刻从床上跳起来，尝试了，不过头部的失血太多，失力的身体又跌回了地面，伴随眼和耳的剧烈抽痛。
　　在痛苦与不安中，我还是想办法爬到了房门，躺在那里静听。现在，他们说的是……我的妈妈？
　　我僵住了。
　　真嗣也愣了一会。
　　在一段长时间的沉默后，美里讲完了关于我的故事，而真嗣一言不发。
　　哦，天啊，真嗣还是知道了？我那绝不愿透露一词的……
　　"我几乎是希望我从没有问过。" 他这样开口道。
　　"但是现在你知道了。" 美里的回应更像是一个问句。
　　"我...我想是吧，也许这是值得的。" 他停顿了一下。"我睡觉前得去看看她。"
　　我慌了神。我猛地想从地上爬起，差点被毯子给绊倒——在没意识到自己已经把它拖到了门口的情况下——跌跌撞撞地缩回床边，一头栽倒，假装睡着了。时机把握得恰到好处，我紧接着就听到了轻轻的敲门声，随后门被缓缓推开。我努力让脸部肌肉放松下来，确保营造出的是一种沉睡中的安详假象。
　　*哈，“让自己脸部肌肉放松”，真怪。*
　　我试图在他面前隐藏自己。不，不是这样的。但在记忆里，这从未有过。
　　我听见了他轻柔的脚步声，以及不小心踢到地板上的课本时的低声自责。我背对着墙，面向着他，微微睁开眼皮要去偷看。但我迅速又闭上了眼睛，猝不及防，他突然跪在我身边，带来一阵微风。我感受到了他的脸，现在离我很近很近——我可以清楚地在黑暗中感受到他的呼吸声。
　　这个变态想要做什么？！
　　但他只是松了一口气，伴随着有一根手指触碰了我的脸颊。我开始不住颤抖，在他的轻抚下，我察觉到了我的脸颊伴有湿润。
　　唉，这是我的…淚？
　　我因为某些原因而有过哭泣，搞明白的这一瞬间，有个更柔软的东西拂过脸颊，我感受到夜色温柔在轻挠着耳朵。他的一声低语：“我...明日香...真希望你快些回来。”他或许是离开了，我能感受到他的离去。
　　听到门被关上的声音，我缓缓坐起身来，触摸着他…刚才吻过的脸颊。
> 根据推断这应该是鸟天使对战发生后的第一个晚上，我没有看过 NGE 所以也不太清楚 Asuka 当时的状态，不过既然作者这样写了，那就继续看下去吧。
　　我不明白刚才发生的一切是因为什么，唯泪水不住泣下。
　　
　　2
　　很久以前，我对我的驾驶员同僚做过一些调查，偶然发现了一份真嗣在第一次战斗后的心理评估报告，其中提到了他最初是如何一片空白，随后才逐渐回忆起发生的事情。可以肯定地说，我是完全能理解那样的感受……
　　回忆常常从某种感官输入的唤醒开始，它和你在空白期中经历的事件相同或者类似。在真嗣在报告中提到，火车在轨道上行驶的隆隆声与使徒用能量尖刺猛击 EVA 头部时的声音非常相似。唤起我记忆的也是声音，是我自己的啜泣的声音。
　　我害怕自己的流泪。
　　
　　强烈而刺痛的激光笼罩着我，一只手从里面探出，扎进了我的EVA、心脏还有灵魂。一只眼睛，凝视着我。冰冷、无情、扫荡与掠夺，它揭开了我坚强面具下的真相！我想要躲开，却只能被禁锢在那里接受精神上的强暴。我看到了它所看到的，我看到了我不愿再看到的。无处可逃，无处可去，无人庇护。
　　*妈妈！你离开了我！你为什么要离开我？*
> 此为记忆里小明日香糟糕的过往
　　我听见了绫波丽被告知去拿某样东西来击败使徒。不，不可以，为什么要被那个玩偶解救？！宁溘死以流亡兮，我宁愿从未有人会来救我。
　　没有人...没有人...没有人*没有人没有人没有人没有人？*
　　不，有人在这里，有个人在紧紧地抱住我，就在此时，用着最有力的双臂。
　　“真...？”我听见自己开口惊讶地问道。
　　“不，明日香，是我，我一直都在这，”回答我的是一个成熟的女声，“你刚才做噩梦了，一切都没事了，shh, shh……”现在一只像是温柔的手抚摸着我的头发。
　　我想我几乎感受到了彻底的失望，不过伪装成任何人类的接触也可以作为急需的慰藉。
　　“妈…妈妈……？”虽然我立刻就知道那绝不是真正的妈妈，然后发现自己转身去拥抱的变成了美里，过往的温暖记忆又回到了我身边。
　　还有某个人…他，*我和他*…我，然后移动着——从光束中走出，走向那个玩偶…她拿起那东西，转身，扔出去——完成了。
　　不，还没结束……坐在外面……有人来了，真的是他……他在说话……他紧紧地抱住了我，我在哭……我厌恶自己在落泪，但现在也许……没有那么讨厌了。我哭得很厉害，想要说些什么……他……也在哭吗？他似乎在说着什么，我闭上了眼睛……一切都过去了。
　　我想自己又沉入了梦乡，沉浸在妈……美里温暖的怀抱中，在那之前，我听到了一串脚步声还有一个特别的声音。“发生什么了？！”那声音问着，一个年轻的声音，一个男孩的声音。
　　我怎么了…我什么也不知道……
　　
　　3
　　再一次，我睁开了双眼，这次的意识清晰多了。没有突如其来的压抑、没有可怕的记忆会把我击溃，但那些记忆早已存在，回忆已经过去，我仍不住颤抖。
　　尽管我很想继续这样，但我知道我不能永远都躺在床上。我那咕咕叫的肚子提醒着我，我缓缓起身，擦去眼角的干垢。
　　哦，这眼垢可真多。
　　顺着窗帘后透出的暗淡光线，我看了一眼时钟。这才刚过 6 点，昨天我到底睡了几个小时？我试图理清这个问题，同时从床上坐起身来。
　　沉浸在思索之中，我的脚差点就踩在了真嗣脸上——再往左偏个两厘米，就会碰到他的鼻子——他在我脚趾上的柔和气息让我留意到他一直陪在我身旁。
　　这突如其来的惊吓让我又跌回了床上，我慌忙眨了眨眼想要平复内心。
　　他到底在做什么……好吧，这似乎不是个问题。一瞬间，我的心底涌起了一丝愤怒，但它和另一种情绪彼此交织，我很快就平静了下来。我小心翼翼地起身，跪在他的旁边，像是两个人在玩着什么奇怪的游戏。
　　他躺在自己的睡袋里，上面盖着毯子，用右臂来当着枕头。我脑中某个角落的同理心漫不经心地游荡到了他的手臂，靠着那种的姿势，他的手只会因为血液流通不畅而完全麻木。我摇摇头，将这些杂念抛开，继续在昏暗的光线中仔细地观察他。
　　此刻，他的脸上完全是一片空白，看不出任何表情。不知为何，我本以为会看到些什么——或许是微笑，皱眉，甚至是眼泪，我也说不清这是为什么。
　　我无法理解他。如果我的记忆无误，我不明白他为何会如此在意我。要说他还会这样关心我，我打心底无法相信。不过是个普通的青春期中的男孩，他对我身上发生的事情又能真正懂些什么呢。
　　他不过是个孩子，如是回荡在我心中一隅的话语。
　　脑海中又涌上一阵低语，我不也还是个孩子吗？哪怕已经拿到了大学的学位，加持还是把我当个孩子来看……我又到底多知道了些什么呢？
> 原文没有出现加持，这里是我做的一点小小改编来符合中文语境，在鸟天使的精神攻击下，明日香先是看到的加持，然后才是真嗣，我认为这样的改写不会对后续的发展造成影响。
　　
　　睡梦中的他动了动，更加侧向那略微扭曲的手臂。我触碰了他的手，一片冰冷，和我想的一样。我再去抚摸他的脸颊，就像他过去几天中他可能会对我做的那样，带去了一点温暖，和我想要的一样。
> 这里原文中确实是“几天”，也许是作者在编排时遗漏了一些时间线上的细节

　　他甚至没有动一下，除了眉头上的微微一蹙。
　　我迅速打消了捉弄他的念头。我没有那种心情，真的没有。
　　为了确保我依然保持这种“没有心情”的状态，我悄悄离开了房间，朝着厨房走去。的确有一阵子没吃过东西了……
　　有趣的是，当我将面包放入烤面包机时，我意识到除了醒来时的那些短暂刺痛外，我几乎什么感觉也没有。我非常平静，非常冷静，非常克制。如果我还能感觉到不安的话，那我的这种状态足够让人不安的了。
　　我不能确定自己感受到的是什么，我似乎什么感觉都没有，这让人很烦躁。
　　*啊，至少我还有烦躁的感受，* 熟悉的感觉又回来了。我叹了口气，这也许并非我希望中的那样，我从房间里出来想要的是能够理性的思考，但我又总陷入到自己的无边思绪。
　　一阵细微的脚步声引起了我的注意，是 Penpen，我想是我寻找早餐的声音把他给吵醒了，虽然我确信自己并没有发出多大的声音。唉，没什么，但我很想把他就这样抱起来，紧紧地搂在怀里。
　　我抑制住了想要和他说话的冲动，尽管这看上去和那些愚蠢家伙的行为完全不同，唉，我这到底是怎么了？我叹了口气不再去管这种“一点也不明日香”的想法，用一口气吹了吹他头上红艳的羽毛，*我想我又开始会感到害怕了。*
　　我没法肯定地描述自己所处的状态，对于这点我没法否定。
　　“明日香？”
　　突然被叫到名字让我摔倒了，企鹅 Penpen 也被我给绊倒了。但在一瞬间中我就意识到那不是真嗣，而是美里。
　　“你好些了吗？”她来到了我身边，将扶我了起来。
　　“啊，没事。嗯，谢、谢谢……”
　　> 原案中美里和明日香很不对付，这个设定被部分沿用到了本作，因此这番“友善的交谈”确能反映出明日香的很不寻常
　　
　　我回过神来时自己已经在默默地吃着吐司了。令我意外的是，坐在对面的美里手中捧着的居然是一杯茶。她透过明显疲惫但是格外专注的眼神在仔细地观察我，这还是让感到很不舒服，于是我决定先来打破沉默。
　　“真嗣……你让他睡在我的房间里了？”
　　“是的。在你昨晚经历了...噩梦之后，他坚持要留下来陪你然后守夜，”她的声音带有和往日一样的戏谑，"我想他有会些失望，因为先和你说话的人是我。"
　　“我知道了。”
　　“我想你明白的，他是真的很在意你。”
　　我不打算回答那个问题，相反，我问了一个我必须要问的问题。
　　“你为什么要告诉真嗣关于我母亲的事？”我说，声音低沉得几乎不像是我会发出的那种。
　　美里也许是早有准备，但她的目光确实先落在了茶杯上，然后才回答。
　　“是真嗣提出的他想要知道，昨天的事情让他……我认为他有这个权利。”她抬起头，微笑着，“你不会生气吧？我知道这不是你愿意随便和其他人分享的事情。”
　　是的，那肯定。不过，在经历了那…那件事后，他肯定想知道些什么。我不能怪他，但总感觉这样的想法哪里不太对劲。
　　“我，我想我并不生气。只是...嗯，我不知道。你明白吗？”我停了下来，吃完了剩下的吐司。美里没有再想从我这里打听些什么，我想我应该感谢这点。
　　我站起身，把盘子放进水槽。
　　“美里…”我的舌头沉重而迟钝，但我还是强迫它动起来。“也谢谢你昨晚的帮助。”
　　“哦，当然，没什么。”她的声音透露出温暖和关切。我看着她，眼中和笑容里都传达出了同样的温暖。
　　我可以叫她“妈妈”？不，那不可能……
　　我点点头，然后去洗澡了。
　　
　　4
　　我知道自己最近比平时要沉默得多。我想是因为我真的不知道该说些什么，对于真嗣，还有美里……要是他还在世，甚至在加持面前也会如此。
　　听到那个消息时我没有哭。我很难受，他算是我的为数不多的好朋友，但我也不会落泪。
　　那时的我感到很疲惫……
　　我以为我会很爱他。我真这样认为，但我知道，有些人会说这只是那种少女时的迷恋……也许现在的我也会这么说，但在当时，这种情感对我来说意义重大。我很想直接伸出手去，但为什么是他呢？我关注他，他却是我永远也无法触及的人，我们不会有什么别的关系，就像大家都知道的那样，而且……我不需要别人，我可以只是一个人，这样的想法也超越了那种伸出手去的冲动。即使在那时，这种一厢情愿也不会真的让我做出什么行动。也是，每当他在律子、玛雅或是 NERV 中的其他任何女性面前表现出最轻微的兴趣时，美里都会流露出最直接的嫉妒，而她从未对我与加持所谓的“约会”有过丝毫反应……事实上，他——
　　已经够了。他不在这里了，就像……
　　不，她也走了。都过去那么久了，不要再提她了。
　　那些没有离开的人呢，他们怎么办？
　　我一直把所有人都推开，这一点很明显，不是吗？然后呢，要是有人推不开，我就会逃跑。或者也许我就是一直都在躲避，我总在把自己面前的人都给推开。但是，*该死的，当那个人不放手时，我就很难从那个人身边逃开。* 
　　我不明白，除了他……也除了美里，还有谁呢？我对他们做了所有那些事，但他们都不在乎吗？他们为什么不断地要想靠近我？为什么他们这么想要扰乱我的生活？这样……这样很舒服。我喜欢舒适，如果没什么别的。
> 这一段的原文是，不太知道该怎么翻译，我原本理解的是除了真嗣和明日香外没有人真正关心明日香的内心，他们只想从她那里谋得什么身份地位或者优越感，不过后面的“扰乱我的生活”以及“一个人也能很舒适”不知道有什么内涵

　　嗯，或许，我应该停止逃避。或许，有什么人或什么东西会告诉我该停下来了。是吗，或许吧。啊，但说起来容易，要想真正停下来，那可就是另一回事了。
　　但我还有的选吗？
> 在明日香的视角下，真嗣对于绫波丽投射的关注要远胜过自己，因此他认为像这样“没有男子气概”的少年只乐意有一个便于操纵的人偶可以携手，而明日香绝不会接受

　　我已经彻底无力了。
　　
　　5
　　我走出了浴室，调整着身上的浴巾，感觉好多了…算是吧。经过厨房时，我发现葛城小姐果然本性难移，此刻已经睡着了。她把头枕在手臂上，趴在餐桌边，茶杯也打翻了。我勉强挤出一丝微笑，继续走向我的房间，准备换衣服迎接新的一天。
　　我走进房间，挪步到衣柜前，解开毛巾，正要放下时，突然听到身后传来的一声喷嚏，接着又是哈欠声，随后还有些许窸窣声。
　　然后，又传来一阵像是哽住的声音。
　　“我…我…我现在就出去，这样你就可以…就可以…”接着是一阵迅速朝门口走去的脚步声。门滑开了，然后轻轻地咔哒一声关上了。
　　我得开始记得这些细节，比如这个房间里还有别人。
　　当我从僵硬、满脸通红的状态中恢复过来后，我穿好衣服，小心翼翼地走了出去。和我想的一样，是真嗣，他正坐在外面，揉着胳膊。
　　他抬头望向我，我低头看向他。
　　时间流逝。
　　最终，他站了起来，但我们只是继续彼此对视，目光相接。
　　嗯，算是吧。走廊有点暗，但还算可以，我想应该是这样。
　　然后，似乎是某种默契的信号，也许是我们的同步训练留下的痕迹，我们同时移开视线，转身走向客厅。我们并排坐在沙发上，盯着叠放的双手。当他终于开口时，我几乎松了一口气。
　　“你，你还好吗？”
　　“嗯。”
　　哦，明日香你真行。给个单字回答，这不是明摆着让人继续沉默吗。
　　“抱歉，关于——”
　　“没关系，是我忘了你在里面。”
　　我突然发现一只手握住了我的手。我僵硬了一会，但还是克制住了立刻抽手回去的冲动。相反，我慢慢地从他温柔的握持中抽出了手。
　　“不要再这样了。”
　　“明日香？”
　　“别碰我。就是别再碰我了。”*我为什么会这么说？*
　　我能看出他很困惑，也许还是和我一样困惑。我不是刚说过我没事吗？
　　“你……你确定你没事吗？”
　　看吧？
　　“不，我想不是，”我厉声说着，而我内心的一部分现在相当震惊，我似乎又在失去控制力了，“我只是经历了一场……你知道吗？如果你还没注意到的话。”
　　“是的，我知道。我当时在场。”他的声音中透露着坚定和力量，这让我也眨了眨眼。“而且我说过我会支持你。”
　　“哦，你当时确实这么做了，是吗？”
　　"我说过我会保护你的。"
　　这让我不禁挑了挑眉。
　　“我不会把单纯的文字当真的。”
　　“不——那不只是言语的承诺！”他听上去竟然有些……愤慨？不完全是，但很相似。
　　我缓缓转过头去看着他，一句反驳像是自然而然地涌到嘴边，却在喉咙里卡住了。
　　是那双眼睛，他的眼睛。我凝视着它们，也是深蓝色的。以往在他身边那么久，我竟未曾察觉。我一直以为它们是深棕色，近乎黑色，就像大多数日本人那样，但现在我必须得看清楚，它们正被心中的赤诚所点亮。那里有果断，有谋略，更有生命力。那里充满力量，正如他刚才的声音那般。这个弱小的男孩，在过去几天里，已经在悄然改变。
> 之前贴吧有个分析贴认为绫波丽的红色眼瞳代表着真实，而碇真嗣和明日香的蓝宝石是虚幻的象征，真不知道该如何评价。同样有影评博主分享23年意大利票房冠军《还有明天》中镜子代表着“古老文化”，但在那期视频中好歹是给观众呈现了大段的原片例证，而贴吧那篇在第一部分的收尾处硬加上这个对比真的就挺突兀的

　　它们或许只是言语，但言语拥有力量，尤其是当你能看出某人是真心实意时。
　　而我感到害怕。
　　我脸上的皱眉，几乎像是一种冷笑，又逐渐缓和了下去。我现在小心翼翼地让表情保持着空白。
　　“真嗣，你知道那东西对我做了什么吗？”
　　“什么？你是说……它窥探了你的思想？”
　　“是的，它窥探了我的思想。但远不止这些，它不仅窥探，还让我也跟着观看。它强行闯入我内心，它从我这里取走了记忆。那东西没有权利让它这么做，但它还是这样做了。我不想让它那样，你知道的吧？我不想让它窥探那里，它让我感觉自己很肮脏。”
　　这些话语脱口而出，快得几乎连成一片——但我必须说出来，并且要快，否则可能就说不出口了……*你知道它对我做了什么吗？它侵犯了我，它玷污了我，而你现在也了解我了。你知道我是怎样的人，我是个糟糕的人，我对你，对所有人，都做了相同的事。我不配拥有任何东西，你知道了就该离我远点，所以别再碰我了。*
　　我隐约意识到自己眼中并无泪水，它们清澈无比，但真嗣，那个可怜的家伙，却是在哭泣。
　　*别说那样的话！你不是那个人，我知道你不是……你不可能是，因为，因为我，我，我——*
> 在最黑暗的那段人生，是我自己把自己拉出深渊，如果没有那个人，我就去做那个人。——中岛美嘉

　　“难道你会爱我吗？”
　　哦，他脸上的表情真是无价之宝。如果那一刻我有丝毫想要幽默的倾向，我肯定会笑出声来，但我并没有笑。
　　“我……我，我，我怎么了？”
　　“你爱我吗？你想说的就是这个吗？”
　　他低下头，脸涨得通红，双手紧握成拳。
　　“我…我吗？我不知道…我不…我不认为我知道那是什么。关于爱，我是说…我想…我想我还太年轻，真的不能懂该怎样去做……”
　　该死。这也正是我无法真正回应的答案，真的做不到。
　　“哦。”我停顿了一下，把目光短暂地移开，然后说道，“我想我也是。毕竟，我也这么小，嗯，我是这么想的。”
　　“但是明日香，我确实会很在意你，我明白这一点。我承诺过我会一直在你身边，我是认真的。”他再次抬头看我，平静下来，眼神清澈。
　　我无法回答，只能摇头。
　　我真是个彻头彻尾的傻瓜。
　　不，并不是这样。白痴指的是智商 25 或者更低的人，我想是这样。而我，智商远超 150，这是天才的标志。我在 14 岁时就大学毕业了，我是个超级天才。
　　但我就是个彻头彻尾的傻瓜，白痴说的就是我。
　　对不起，真嗣。
　　我离开了房间，没给他回答的机会。也好——
　　反正我也不太确定自己为何会道歉。
　　
　　6
　　我这样的人怎么会通不过 EVA 同步测试呢？
　　同步测试不是‘失败’，而是得到一个分数，一个百分比。就像智商测试一样，你不会‘失败’智商测试，飞行员也不会‘失败’同步测试，或许这根本就不是它的设定方式。但那句——
　　“同步测试失败。”
　　荒谬！只有那些无法与 EVA 同步的人才会“失败”这项测试，那些不是由“马尔杜克”选中的，或者无论谁选中的非驾驶员。
　　“同步测试失败。”
　　飞行员会得到一个百分比，即心智与 EVA 之间链接成功率的评分，以及连接的完整程度。
　　同步测试失败。
　　律子的话在我脑海中回响，舌尖上尝起来像灰烬。连接就是无法建立——接口毫无反应。然后他们用零号机测试了零二号机，与绫波进行，奇怪的是，现在回想起来，我并没有反对让奇迹少女进入我的专属机体。
　　她同步得很好。
　　我再次尝试。
　　又一次。
　　真嗣进来了。他在进入舱门之前，用一种奇怪的眼神看了我一眼。
　　他与机体的同步很顺利。
　　我再次尝试。
　　又来了，该死！
　　又是这样！
　　而现在，我躺在了更衣室附近休息室的沙发上。LCL 从我的头发滴落，我懒得去洗澡——我根本不想动，而这沙发大概也被我弄坏了。
　　我看到碇司令在放弃之前对葛城低语了几句，她皱了皱眉，然后看向我，我看到……
　　*我有没有告诉过你，我也很害怕？*
　　我的目的，我的角色，正如副司令冬月所说，不是驾驶 EVA，而是击败使徒。但如果我不能驾驶 EVA，那么我就无法击败使徒，我将毫无用途。我猜那就是司令对葛城低语的内容.…
　　我听到了脚步声，那当然还是他的。我抬起头，“别说了，真嗣。无论是什么，都别说。”
　　他什么也没说，但他确实向我看了一眼。
　　我移开视线，看向灯光，看向房间里的植物，看向其他任何东西。我的目光最终落在时钟上，这才刚过下午三点，漫长的一天还在后面。
　　我眨了眨眼，仅仅一瞬间，在那一刻。
　　三点半？什么？
　　这时我才意识到律子在摇晃我，她什么时候进来的？还有为什么真嗣……唉，又哭了，我真是没用呢。
　　我迅速摆脱了那种感觉，坐起身来。“发生了什么事？”
　　真嗣努力让自己镇定下来，深呼吸了几下。“我……我让你一个人待了大概十五分钟，然后我走过去，试图叫醒你。你一动不动，连眼睛都不眨一下，只剩下呼吸了。天啊，明日香，你真的吓坏我了！”他伸出手来抓住我的肩膀，手指微微颤抖。
　　我并没有直接甩开他……但也没有明显地回应他的触碰，我的大脑被其他事情塞得满满当当。
　　“什么？但我只是在……到底发生了什么？”
　　律子看了看真嗣，然后又看向我。“我想我们会弄清楚的。来吧，跟我们去医务室。”
　　害怕都不足以形容这种感觉……
　　她领我走出房间时，我发现自己竟本能地在寻找真嗣，渴望得到他的关心……但我只瞥见一抹深邃的暗蓝，就被带出了门，经过拐角。然而，那一瞥在那一刻对的我意义重大，就在那时，我就明白自己是彻底地输了。
　　
　　7
　　我坐在床上，努力让这件滑稽的、点缀着蓝色斑点的病号服裹紧自己。我在等待——
　　敲敲门。
　　“明日香？”
　　我知道他会来的。
　　“嗯。”
　　门小心翼翼地吱呀一声开了。他变得又熟悉又陌生，令人烦躁：总是小心翼翼，随时准备道歉，退缩着，到处蹑手蹑脚……然而，他有时又会挺身而出，展现出自己的一丝锋芒。我再也猜不透他了——完全猜不透。
　　"嗯，我可不可以——"
　　"可以，你进来吧，"我有些不耐烦地说。
　　此刻他正以无骨的形态出现，我忍不住想要窃笑。门开得更大了，他走了进来，看向我身上紧紧裹着的床单，他又迅速移开了目光。"他们还没确定什么…"
　　我抢先一步回答，“但这是……”
　　“这事和‘那个’有关。”我眨了眨眼，对他声音中的激烈感到惊讶。
　　“嗯。”
　　“真该死，”他咆哮着，紧握拳头，猛地抬头直视我，“我不在乎我父亲会说些什么，但我一定要让初号机解除冻结！"
　　这一次，我捕捉到他保持着坚定的目光，毫不退缩。我必须要这么做，在之前已经让步太多了，而我不能再逃避，但他也没有丝毫动摇。
　　如果指挥官拒绝释放初号机，愿上帝帮助他。
　　“你为什么这么说？”我轻声问道，“为什么你要让初号机出来？”
　　他那凶狠的表情突然转为困惑，“什么？”
　　“你想主动挑战使徒？为什么？”
　　他几乎变得有些尴尬，我想，他的脸颊突然泛起一丝红晕，我原以为他会退缩成懦弱的样子。
　　我早该明白的。我不是刚说过，我已经无法预料他的行为了吗？
　　他放松了面部表情，也松开了拳头，开口说道：“因为，如果我之前在那里，我就能保护你。就像我承诺的那样，我想确保我能继续这样做，为了保护你。”
　　“即使现在看起来我不能再驾驶了？”
　　“那这和现在有什么关系？”他走近了一步，既不犹豫，也不能说是坚定。
　　"如果我不能驾驶，那为什么——"
　　"我不在乎那个！" 他的爆发让我在床上向后一仰。尽管我意识到他在改变，但我没想到会这样，我所能做的只是睁大眼睛回望着他。他继续用更柔和的声音说道，但并未减弱他话语中的决绝程度。
　　“我不是告诉过你吗？我不是告诉过你吗？！你对我很重要，我很在意你！”他每说一个字就向我逼近一步，每个字都充满了愤怒的信念，每个字都响亮而清晰。
　　"我不知道这一切究竟意味着什么，是爱还是其他，但我绝不允许任何事情发生，绝不会让你受到伤害。" 他低声说完，那声音比我所听过的任何尖叫都要响亮。
　　我突然意识到，他的脸离我不到四分之一米；他现在正俯身在床边，双手撑在床垫上——但我真正能看到的只有他的眼睛。如果不小心，我可能会迷失在其中。
　　小心，关心。那是什么？
　　话语。
　　它们仅仅是话语吗？它们难道不只是话语吗？
　　它们无疑是话语，且拥有力量，蕴含意义，确实如此。
　　我伸出手，轻触他的脸颊，感受着他脸上略显粗糙的线条。瞬间，如同以往，他脸上的紧张感消散了。
　　“明日香？”
　　“我想我还是不太明白，但是……谢谢你。”
　　“明日香…”
　　我终于移开视线，感到筋疲力尽…却又出奇地平静。“真嗣，”我终于开口道。
　　“怎么了？”
　　*我……也会被人在意吗。*“握住我的手。”
　　有那么一瞬间——仅是一瞬间的迟疑，他缓缓地将手滑过我的手，放在床上。我抬起手，将手指缠绕在他的手指间，轻轻地握了握。他伸出左手，抬起我的下巴，以便能凝视我的眼睛，而我没有丝毫想要移开目光的冲动。
　　或许我现在还不理解，不理解碇真嗣，尤其是不理解他。但是……我想要去理解。
　　就这样，他缓缓地拉近我——不，是我们彼此拉近，在温柔的拥抱中相遇。他拥抱着我，我拥抱着他。我感受到，并不只是听到，他那释然而满足的叹息。我闭上眼睛，将头靠在他的肩上。
　　这还真是……舒适。
　　真好，在第三次冲击后的日本，春祺夏安就是这样。
As always, spoiler warnings: this is an altered continuity, after  
episode 22.Here is the sequel to "I Mustn't Run Away". (I'd advise that it have  
been recently read before reading this; find it atSorry it's so long. ^_^) This one is from Asuka's perspective. I reallyhope I got it right. I also hope that this, along with the previousstory, will show for sure that I do really like Asuka. Yes, really.(That is perhaps my biggest regret with NGEjd.)This story (and "I Mustn't Run Away", retroactively) is for MichaelBorgwardt, in particular. Have fun.***********************************************An Oddzilla Productions fanfic, by Andrew Huang.In Other WordsBased on Neon Genesis Evangelion, c. Gainax Studios and ADVision.  
I opened my eyes. Strange, I didn't remember closing them.Actually, what did I remember last? Ahh, my mind was too fuzzy. Iclosed my eyes again. That was when I heard Misato and Shinji talking.About me, it seemed.  
I would have sprung out of bed then-and I tried, but the blood lossto my head only let me fall limply to the floor instead, my eyes andears throbbing without mercy. I managed to crawl to the door, where Ilay for a few moments, listening. They were talking about...My mother?  
I froze.  
Apparently, so had they, because there was now a long pause. It seemedthat Misato had finished her story about me. Shinji wasn't sayinganything.  
Oh, God, Shinji knew? About...about...  
"I almost wish I hadn't asked," he finally said.  
"But now you understand," answered Misato. Almost a question.  
"I...I think so. Maybe." He paused. "I'm going to check on her beforeI go to bed."  
I panicked. I lurched to my feet, almost tripping on my blanket-Ihadn't realized that I had dragged it with me to my door-shuffled to mybed, flopped down, and feigned sleep. It was not a moment too soon,because I heard a soft knock an instant later, then the door slidingopen. I forced my face to relax, so as to make sure of the illusion ofblissful unconsciousness on my part.  
Hah, "forced my face to relax". Howodd.  
I've never tried to hide like this. No, not like this. Not that I canever remember.  
I heard his soft footsteps and him cursing quietly when he kicked oneof the textbooks on the floor by accident. I was facing away from thewall, towards him, and I cracked my eyelids a tiny bit open to look. Iquickly closed them again as I saw him kneel down next to me, feeling arush of air from the sudden movement. Apparently, his face was veryclose to mine, now-I could hear his breathing clearly. What was hedoing?  
He sighed, and I felt a finger brush my cheek, making me quiverinvoluntarily. But it was only because of his touch that I realized thatmy cheek was wet.  
Wet?  
As my addled brain wriggled out the conclusion that I had been cryingfor some reason, I felt something else, something softer, touch mycheek, while some moving air tickled my ear. There was a whisper next:"I...Asuka... Get better." Then, he seemed to vanish. I could feel himleave.  
I slowly sat up at the sound the closing door, and I touched my cheekwhere he had...kissed me.  
I'm not sure why, but I started to cry again.-  
Earlier, a long time earlier, I was doing some research on my fellowpilots, and I came upon Shinji's psych evaluation after his firstbattle, about how he had blanked out at first, then recalled what hadhappened much later. I am able to say that I know exactly what that hadbeen like...  
Recall usually starts with some sort of sensory input in the here-and-now that is the same or similar to something that happened when youfirst blanked out. Shinji had said in the report that a train rattlingover some tracks sounded very similar to the Angel pounding the EVA'shead with its energy spike. Mine was a sound, too. My own sobbing.  
I hate crying.  
Yellow light, gripping me. A hand from that light reaching into mymind, heart, soul. An eye, looking at me. Cold, ruthless, searching.Dirty, I felt dirty! I tried to hide, but there was nowhere to go. I sawwhat it saw, I saw what I didn't want to see. No escape. No exit.Mother! You left me! Why did you leave me?Someone telling Rei to get something and defeat the Angel. No, notthat, that, that doll. To be saved by her? I'd rather die. I'd ratherhave no one save me.No one...no one...no one no onenoonenoonesomeone?Yes, someone. Holding me, tight, with strong arms. Here and now."Shin...?" I heard myself ask."No, Asuka, but I'm right here," answered a mature female voice. "Youwere having a nightmare. It's okay. Shh, shh..." A gentle hand strokedmy hair.I think I almost felt disappointed, but any human contact now wassorely needed comfort. "Ma...ma..." though I knew immediately it wasn'tMama. I found myself shifting around to hug Misato, as the rest flewback to me.Yes, someone. Him. _Him_. Me. Me, moving. Me, moving out of the light,towards the doll. Taking that thing, turning around, throwing. It wasdone.No, it wasn't done. Sitting outside. Someone coming. Him, again. Him,talking. Him, grabbing me. Me, crying. I hate crying, but maybe not somuch now. Me, crying more, talking. Him...crying, too? Him, talking. Me,closing my eyes. Closing my eyes.I felt myself dropping off to sleep again, sinking into the warmth ofM...Misato's embrace, but not before hearing a set of footsteps and avoice. "What's wrong?" said the voice, a younger voice, a boyish voice.Everything. And nothing.-Again, I opened my eyes, though I was much more coherent this time.There was no sudden rush of repressed, terrible memories to throw meoff, because the memories were already there. I shivered, though it waswarm.As much as I wanted to, I knew I couldn't stay in bed forever. Mygrowling stomach reminded me of that, and I slowly rose, wiping thecrust out of my eyes.Ow. That was a lot of crust.I noted the dull glow from behind the shades, and looked at the clock.Barely 6 am. How long had I slept, yesterday? I tried to puzzle that outas I swung myself off the bed.Being so preoccupied, my foot almost landed on Shinji's face. Twocentimeters to the left, and I would have hit his nose. It was hisbreath on my toes that told me he was there.The surprise sent me falling back on my mattress, blinking. What washe doing...well, I suppose that would be a stupid question to ask. A bitof anger warred with...something else within me, for just an instant,but I calmed down. With care, I got out, and knelt down next to him. Twocan play at this game.He was lying on a sleeping bag, with his blanket on top, and using hisright arm as a pillow. Some part of me idly noted that the way his armwas positioned, it was probably completely numb from loss of blood flowto it. I shook the stray thought from my head, and studied him closelyin the dim light.His face was, at the moment, expressionless. For some reason, Iexpected something there-perhaps a smile, a frown...maybe tears, even.I don't know why.I didn't understand him. I couldn't see why he cared that much aboutme, if my memory served me correctly. He said he did, but I couldn'treally believe it. He was just a boy, he didn't know about things likethat.  
A whisper in my head. Just a child, he was.  
Another whisper in my head. But I was, too. So what would I know aboutthings like that?  
He shifted in his sleep, rolling even more onto his slightly twistedarm. I touched his hand. Cold, like I thought it would be. Then Itouched his cheek, like he had done to me a few times in the past days.Warm, like I thought it would be.  
He didn't even stir, except a little twitch in his brow.  
I quickly shut out visions of playing some prank on him. I wasn't inthe mood for that. Not really.  
To ensure that I would stay "not in the mood", I silently exited myroom, and headed for the kitchen. It really had been a while since Iate...  
Funny. As I put some bread in the toaster, I realized that except forthose momentary twinges when I had woken up, I wasn't feeling much ofanything at all. I was very calm, very cool, very controlled. It wasenough to be unnerving, were I capable of becoming unnerved at themoment.  
I wasn't sure what I was feeling, because it seemed like I wasn'tfeeling anything at all. This was annoying.  
Ah, at least I _was_ annoyed. That was something more familiar. Isighed. This wasn't helping much. I had come out here to think, too, butI kept on getting caught up in my own head.  
A soft scratching drew my attention. Pen-pen. My early breakfast wokehim, though I was sure I hadn't made much noise. Ah well. I scooped himup and held him tightly.  
I repressed the urge to talk to him, as intelligent as he seemed... Aquestion, though, rolled around in my mind: What happens now? I sighed,ruffling the feathers on his head with my breath. I was probably afraid.  
I couldn't feel it, exactly, but that had to be it.  
"Asuka?"  
I fell down, dropping Pen-pen, who squawked in surprise. It took me aninstant to analyze the voice and realize that it wasn't Shinji; rather,it was Misato.  
"Are you okay?" She was at my side, helping me up.  
"Ah, yeah. Th-thanks..."  
I eventually found myself eating toast silently, facing Misato. Ratherunusually, she was drinking some tea, studying me closely, throughevidently tired but attentive eyes. I decided to break the silence.  
"Shinji...you let him sleep in my room?"  
"Yes. After your...nightmare last night, he insisted that he stay withyou and keep watch." Her voice took on a slightly amused tone. "I thinkhe was disappointed that I made it to you first."  
"I see."  
"He really does care about you, you know."  
I didn't answer that. Instead, I asked something I had to ask. "Whydid you tell Shinji about my mother?" I said, in a voice I would barelyhave recognized as my own.  
Misato didn't seem at all caught off guard, but her eyes did dip tostudy her teacup before answering. "Shinji wanted to know. After whathappened yesterday...I think he had the right." She looked back up, andsmiled.  
"You're not angry, are you? I know it's not something you wantedto share particularly."  
Yes, of course. After what had happened with that...thing, he wouldwant to know. I couldn't blame him. But something still felt wrong aboutit.  
"I, I guess I'm not angry. Just...well, I don't know. You know?" Istopped, finishing the rest of my toast. Misato did not try to strike upmore conversation, for which I was grateful.  
I got up, and put my plate in the sink. "Misato..." My tongue wasthick and unresponsive, but I forced it to work. "Thank you for lastnight, too."  
"Of course." Her voice was warm, caring. I looked at her, and saw thesame warmth in her eyes and smile.  
I called her "Mama"? No, I couldn't have...  
I nodded, and went to take a bath.  
-I'd been quieter than usual, I know that. I suppose it was because Ireally didn't know what to say, definitely not to Shinji, not to Misato,and, were he around, not even to Kaji.  
I didn't cry when I heard. I felt terrible, yes...he was a friend, agood friend, but I didn't cry.  
I felt tired then...  
I thought I loved him. I really did. I know, some would say it wasjust one of those schoolgirl crushes...maybe even I would say that now,but at the time, it meant so much. I had this need to reach out. But whyhim? I was focusing on him, because he was someone already out of myreach, so it wouldn't really ever matter, you know, and... My need tobe self-sufficient superceded that reaching out, even then. It never wasreal. Ha, Misato got jealous every time he showed the slightest bit ofinterest in Ritsuko or Maya or any of the other women in NERV, but shenever even reacted slightly when I went on "dates" with him...in truth,he-  
Enough. He's not here anymore, like...  
No, she's gone, too. A long time ago. No more about her.  
What about the people who aren't gone?  
I've been pushing everyone away. It's easy to see that, isn't it? Andthen, if someone wouldn't be pushed away, then I would run away. Ormaybe I've just been running this whole time. I was pushing myself away.But, dammit, it's hard to run from a person when that person won't letgo of you.  
I don't understand, not him...not Misato, either. Who are thesepeople? I've done all of those things to them, but they don't care? Howdo they keep coming closer and closer to me? Why do they want to disruptmy life? It's been...it's been comfortable, this way. I like beingcomfortable, if nothing else.  
Well, perhaps, I should stop running away. Perhaps, someone orsomething is telling me to stop. Yes, perhaps. Ah, but it's so mucheasier to say that. To stop for real, well, that's something else,completely.  
Did I have a choice, though?  
I felt very tired.  
-  
I left the bathroom, adjusting my towel around me, feeling muchbetter...sort of. Passing the kitchen, I observed that Misato was beingtrue to her nature, now asleep. She had her head cushioned in her armsat the kitchen table, teacup knocked over. I managed to find the abilityto smile a bit. I continued on to my room, to get dressed for the day.  
I walked in, shuffled to my dresser, opened the towel, and was aboutto drop it, when I heard a sneeze behind me, a yawn, followed a bit ofrustling.  
Then there was something that sounded like choking.  
"I-I-I, I'll go out now, so you can, you can..." Some footstepsquickly padded their way to the door, which slid open, then softlyclacked shut.  
I have got to start remembering details like when there's someoneelse in my room.  
Once I managed to get out of my frozen, red-faced state, I put on myclothes and carefully walked out the door. As I had suspected, there wasShinji, sitting just outside, rubbing his arm.  
He looked up at me. Ilooked down at him.  
Time passed.  
Finally, he stood up, but we simply continued looking at each other,eye to eye.  
Well, sort of. The hallway was a little dark. Good enough, though. Isupposed so, anyway.  
Then, on some unspoken cue, perhaps a remnant of our synchronicitytraining, we broke eye contact, turned simultaneously, and walked toliving room. We both sat down on the couch, next to each other, andstared at our folded hands. I almost sighed with relief when he finallyspoke.  
"You, you're feeling okay?"  
"Yes."  
Oh, real good, Asuka. Give a one-word answer that just asks for moresilence.  
"Sorry about-"  
"It's all right. My fault I forgot you were in there."  
I suddenly found a hand around my own. I stiffened, but resisted theimpulse to snatch it away. Instead, I slowly pulled it out of his gentlegrip. "Please, don't."  
"Asuka?"  
"Don't touch me. Just don't." Why was I saying this?  
I could tell he was confused. Maybe as much as I was. Hadn't I justsaid that I was all right?  
"Are...are you sure you're okay?"  
See?  
"No, I suppose not," I snapped. A part of me was now rather horrified.I seemed to be losing control. "I just kind of went through something,you know? In case you hadn't noticed."  
"Yes, I know. I was there." There was strength in his voice, firmness.It made me blink. "And I said I'd be there for you."  
"Oh, you did, did you?"  
"I said I'd protect you."  
That earned a raised eyebrow from me.  
"They're just words."  
"I-no-they're not just words!" He actually sounded...indignant? Notquite, but something like it.  
I slowly turned to look at him, a rebuttal automatically finding itsway to my voice, then getting lodged somewhere in my throat.  
Those eyes, his eyes. I looked into them. They're actually a darkblue. I hadn't noticed before, in all the time I'd been around him. I'djust thought they were a deep brown that looked black, like mostJapanese. But I had to see now, so lit up by a fire in them. There wasintent, purpose, meaning in them. There was strength in them, the sameas his voice. This weak little boy had changed, sometime in the past fewdays.  
They might be just words, but words have power. Especially when youcan see when someone means them.  
And I was afraid.  
The frown on my face, almost a sneer, relaxed away. I now carefullyleft my expression blank. "Shinji, do you know what that thing did tome?"  
"What? You mean... It looked into your mind?"  
"Yes, it looked into my mind. But it did more than that. It lookedinto my mind, and made me look too. It forced its way into me. It tookout things from me. That thing had no right, but it went ahead. I didn'twant it to, you know that? I didn't want it looking there. It made mefeel dirty."  
The words came out faster, almost running into each other-I had tosay them, and quickly, or they might not be said... "You know what itdid to me? It raped me. It violated me. And you know about me, now, too.You know how I am. I'm a terrible person. I've done all that to you, toeveryone. I don't deserve anything. You should just leave me alone. Sodon't touch me."  
I was dimly aware that there were no tears from my eyes. They wereperfectly clear. But Shinji, that poor jerk, he was crying.  
"Don't say that! You aren't, I know you aren't... You couldn't be,because, because I, I, I-"  
"You love me?"  
Oh, the look on his face was priceless. If I had been even theslightest bit inclined to humor at that moment, I would have laughed.I didn't laugh.  
"Do I...do I, do I, I what?"  
"Do you love me? Is that what you're trying to say?"  
He looked down, face red, hands curled into fists. "I...do I? I don'tknow... I don't...I don't think I know what it is. Love, I mean. Ithink...I think I'm too young to really know."  
Damn. That was exactly the answer that I couldn't really respond to.Not really. "Oh." I paused for a moment, looking away momentarily, thensaid, "I suppose I am, too. Young, I mean."  
"But Asuka-I do care about you, I know that. I promised that I'll bethere for you, and I mean it." He was looking up at me again, calmer,and with clear eyes.  
I could not answer. Only shake my head.  
I'm an absolute idiot.  
No, I'm not. An idiot means someone with an IQ of 25 or lower, I thinkit is. I, on the other hand, have an IQ well above 150, the genius mark.I graduated from college at the age of 14. I'm a supergenius.  
I'm an absolute fool. That's what I am.  
"I'm sorry, Shinji."  
I left the room, giving him no chance to answer me. Just as well-Iwasn't quite sure what I was apologizing for, anyway.  
-How does one fail an EVA synchronization test?  
You don't _fail_ a synch test, you get a score, a percentage. Justlike you get a score on an IQ test. You don't _fail_ an IQ test. And apilot doesn't fail a synch test. That's simply not how it's set up.  
"Synchronization test failed."  
Ridiculous! Only someone who can't synchronize with an EVA could"fail" that test. Someone who's not a pilot, chosen by the MardukReport, or whoever it is.  
"Synchronization test failed."  
A pilot gets a percentage, a rating on the success of the link betweenmind and robot, the completeness of the bond.  
"Synchronization test failed."  
Ritsuko's words rang in my head, and tasted like ash on my tongue. Theconnection just never happened-the interface wouldn't budge. Then theytested Unit 02 with Rei. Oddly enough, now that I look back at it, Ihadn't protested allowing the Wonder Girl into my Unit.  
She synchronized just fine.  
I tried again.  
And again.  
Shinji got in. He looked at me funny before he entered the hatch.  
He synchronized just fine.  
I tried again.  
Again, dammit!  
AGAIN!  
And now I was here, lying on a sofa in a lounge near the locker room.LCL dripped out of my hair; I hadn't bothered with a shower-I didn'tfeel like it. The sofa was probably getting ruined.  
I saw Commander Ikari whisper something to Misato before I gave up.She frowned, then she looked at me. I saw...  
Did I tell you I was scared, too?  
My purpose, my role here was not to pilot EVA, as SubcommanderFuyutsuki said, but to defeat Angels. But if I can't pilot EVA, then Ican't defeat Angels. I was useless. I bet that was what the Commanderwhispered to Misato...  
I heard footsteps. Him, of course. I raised my head. "Don't say it,Shinji. Whatever it is, don't say it."  
He didn't say anything. But he did look at me.  
I looked away, at the lights, at the plants in the room, at anythingelse. My eyes settled on the clock. Just after three in the afternoon.Long day ahead.  
I blinked. Just-an eyeblink. One moment.  
Half past three? What?  
Now I was aware of Ritsuko shaking me. When did she come in? And whywas Shinji...aw, crying again. The wimp.  
I shook that off, quickly, and sat up. "What's going on?"  
Shinji got a hold of himself, taking a few deep breaths. "I...I letyou alone for fifteen minutes or something. Then I went over to you,tried to get you up. You weren't moving. Not even blinking, justbreathing. God, Asuka, you scared me!" He reached out to hold myshoulder. His fingers trembled slightly.  
I didn't shrug him off...but neither did I outwardly acknowledge histouch. I had other things on my mind.  
"What? But I-it was just... What's going on?"  
Ritsuko looked over at Shinji, then back at me. "We'll find out. Comeon. Let's visit the infirmary."  
Scared wasn't even the word for this...  
As she led me out of the room, I found myself actually seeking outShinji, instinctively, looking for reassurance...but I caught only aglimpse of deep, dark blue before I was swept through the doorway andaround the corner. But what I saw spoke volumes to me, in that moment.That's when I knew I had finally lost.  
-I sat in the bed, trying to keep this ridiculous, blue-speckledhospital gown closed around me. I was waiting-knock knock* "Asuka?"  
-for that. I knew he would be coming.  
"Yeah."  
The door creaked open cautiously. He had become an irritating mix ofold and new: ever so careful, tongue poised to apologize, shrinkingaway, tiptoeing everwhere...while, at times, coming forward, showing aglint of steel on his own. I couldn't predict him anymore-not at all.  
"Um, can I-"  
"Yes, you can come in," I said, slightly exasperated. He was currentlyin his spineless form. I was tempted to snicker. The door opened wider,and he stepped in. Seeing the way I had my sheets wrapped around me, hequickly dropped his gaze. "They don't know anything for sure yet," Ianswered pre-emptively, "but it's..."  
"It's related to _that_." I blinked at the vehemence in his voice.  
"Yeah."  
"Dammit," he snarled, clenching a fist and jerking his head up to faceme, "I don't care what my father says, I'm going to get Unit One out ofthat freeze!"  
This time, I caught and held his gaze, unflinchingly. I had to; aftergiving so much ground before, I couldn't look away. He didn't faltereither.  
God help the commander if he refuses to release Unit One.  
"And why do you say that?" I asked softly. "Why do you want Unit Oneout?"  
His fierce countenance slipped into one of puzzlement. "What?"  
"You want to fight? Why?"  
He almost became embarassed, I think. There was a slight flush to hischeeks suddenly, and I expected him to slip into his wimp mode.  
I should have known better. Hadn't I just said that I couldn't predicthim anymore?  
He relaxed his face, as well as his fist, and spoke. "Because, if Ihad been out there before, I could have protected you. Just like I saidI would. And I want to make sure I can continue to do that. Protectyou."  
"Even though it seems like I can't pilot, anymore?"  
"And what does that have to do with anything?" He stepped closer, nothesitantly, but not quite firmly, either.  
"If I can't pilot, then why-"  
"I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT!" His explosion sent me reeling back in mybed. Though I realized he was changing, I hadn't expected that; all Icould do was stare back at him with wide eyes. He continued in a softervoice, but not any less intense.  
"Haven't I told you? Haven't I _TOLD_you?! You're important to me. I care about you!" He edged closer to mewith every word, every word seething with furious conviction, every wordloud and clear.  
"I don't know what exactly it all means, whether it'slove or something, but I won't let anything happen, not to you." Hefinished with a whisper that spoke louder than most screams I had everheard.  
I suddenly realized that his face was less than a quarter meter frommy own face; he was now leaning over the bed, hands propped on themattress-but all I could really see were his eyes. I could get lost inthem, if I wasn't careful.  
Careful. Care. What was that?  
Words.  
Were they just words? Were they _not_ just words?  
They were words, certainly. And they had power. And they had meaning.Certainly.  
I reached out and touched his cheek, gently, feeling the slightlyrough lines of his face. Instantly, as before, the intensity drainedfrom his features. "Asuka?"  
"I still can't understand, but...thank you."  
"Asuka..."  
I finally looked away, feeling exhausted...and oddly calm. "Shinji," Ispoke.  
"Yes?"  
I...care, too. "Hold my hand."  
There was a moment-just a moment of hesitation. Slowly, he slid hishand over mine, on the bed. I lifted my hand up, twining my fingersbetween his, and squeezed gently. He reached over with his left hand,and lifted my chin up, so that he could look into my eyes. I felt noimpulse to look away, not the slightest bit.  
Maybe I didn't understand now, not Misato, and particularly not him.But...I wanted to.  
And ever so slowly, he drew me...no, we drew each other closer,meeting in a gentle embrace. He held me. I held him. I felt, more thanheard, his sigh of relief-and contentment. I closed my eyes, and leanedmy head against his.  
This was...comfortable.  
Yes, comfortable.  
End.  
-Think "In Your Eyes" by Peter Gabriel. Yes?  
What, you expected them to be all mushy with each other right away?Love is not easy, and in a world like theirs, it's even harder. Asuka'snot out of it yet, either; that mind-rape was a terrible, terrible thingthat will take more than just a day or two to get over.  
About Misato-the Shinji-Misato relationship has been talked plentyabout in the past (guardian, mother, big sister...), but what of Asukaand Misato? They're living together, too. They know each other, theyknow _about_ each other. I'd like to think that there's a bond betweenthem, as well.Will there be more of these? I'd like to do more-as indicated by theabove, I think there's a lot to explore with Misato. I'll see if I cando it. Until then...thank you.
