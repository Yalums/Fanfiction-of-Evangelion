Given the opportunity to try again, what would a troubled girl do differently?  
如果再有一次机会，一个内心困扰的女孩会有何不同？

### Chapter 1

Άλλος βίος, άλλη δίαιτα (Another life, another way) – An old saying  
另种生活，另种方式 —— 一句古谚

A hushed gasp broke the silence of the dark bedroom as the young girl pushed herself up from her bed, eyes darting around the room before she let herself fall back down onto the warm mattress and soft pillows that seemed to welcome her into their embrace like an old friend. In the darkness, her eyes came to rest on a once-familiar ceiling while her panicked breathing and racing heart combined to fill the room and her ears with the sound of her own confusion and alarm.  
黑暗的卧室中，一阵低沉的喘息声打破了寂静。年轻女孩从床上撑起身来，眼睛在房间里四处扫视，随后又让自己倒回温暖的床垫和柔软的枕头上，仿佛一位老友般拥抱着她。在黑暗中，她的目光停留在曾经熟悉的天花板上，而她慌乱的呼吸和急促的心跳声交织在一起，填满了房间和她自己的耳朵，回荡着她的困惑和惊慌。

_This isn't right_, Asuka Langley Soryu thought to herself. _I was–where was I?_ She squeezed her eyes shut and forced her breathing under control; her heartbeat soon followed. _I was in my Eva, with Momma, and our power was out_. Slowly, she rose from the bed again. This time she swung her legs over the edge of the mattress and sat up, bringing the index finger of her left hand to the space between the middle and ring fingers of her right. She ran her finger slowly down across her palm, down along her forearm neatly between her radius and ulna, through her humerus, all the way to her shoulder. _They killed me–no, they_ ate _me._  
这不对劲，惣流·明日香·兰格雷心想。我之前——我在哪儿？她紧闭双眼，强迫自己控制呼吸；心跳也随之平复。我在我的 Eva 里，和妈妈在一起，我们的电源断了。她慢慢地再次从床上坐起。这次她将双腿甩到床边，坐起身来，用左手的食指轻轻触碰右手中指和无名指之间的位置。她沿着手掌，顺着前臂，精确地穿过桡骨和尺骨之间，经过肱骨，一直延伸到肩膀。他们杀了我——不，他们吃了我。

She placed a hand under her loose-fitting night shirt and pressed it against her abdomen, feeling for the raw and bloody mess that should have been there but finding only healthy, smooth skin stretched across taught muscle. She released a breath that she did not know she had been holding and stood up, one hand unconsciously moving to rub her left eye. _Everything they did to Unit 02 was transferred to me, too. And that Idiot was nowhere to be found, of course._ Her face twisted into a scowl as she walked to the vanity that should not have been in this room that should no longer have been hers to live in and found her own gaze in the mirror, dropping her hand back to her side.  
她将手探入宽松的睡衣下，轻按在腹部，寻找那本应存在的血肉模糊的伤口，却只触到紧绷肌肉上平滑健康的肌肤。她松了口气，不知自己何时屏住了呼吸，站起身来，一只手无意识地揉向左眼。零二所承受的一切，也同样转嫁到了我身上。而那个笨蛋，自然是不见踪影。她眉头紧锁，走向本不该出现在这已非她居所的房间里的梳妆台，镜中映出自己的面容，她垂下手，神情阴郁。

Staring back at her was a perfectly healthy 13-year-old girl. Long, red hair, a dull brown in the low light, with bright blue eyes. Gone were the sunken eyes and cheeks, the protruding ribs and hip bones, the cracked lips and matted hair that had come from a spiral of despair and self-loathing and had culminated in catatonia. Her brow furrowed as she thought. _And then there were other people. Lots of people._ She began to go through the drawers of the vanity, though without purpose, grabbing things at random and placing them back in their place as she worked through the flashes of images and faces that she could remember. _Kaji, Misato, Wondergirl, even the Idiot was there. And then–a beach? Red?_ Try as she might, she could not recall what had happened after her supposed death against the Eva Series.  
回望着她的是一个完全健康的 13 岁少女。长发红艳，在昏暗的光线下显得暗沉，一双明亮的蓝眼睛。凹陷的双眼和脸颊、突出的肋骨和髋骨、干裂的嘴唇和纠结的头发，这一切源自绝望与自我厌恶的漩涡，最终导致木僵状态的痕迹已消失无踪。她皱起眉头思索着。接着，她想起了其他人。许多人。她开始翻找梳妆台的抽屉，虽无明确目的，却随手抓起物品又放回原位，脑海中闪过一幅幅画面和面孔。加持、美里、明日香，甚至连那个笨蛋也在其中。然后——海滩？红色？尽管她竭力回想，却记不起在与 EVA 系列机体对决后假死之后的任何事情。

_If this is the afterlife then count me the fuck out_, she thought, as she slammed shut the drawer she had been rifling through. _I get eaten alive trying to save the world, and the thanks I get is to be shipped back into this dump in Berlin?_ Whether she believed what she was seeing was real or not, she recognized the room she was in. A small studio-style living area in the heart of NERV-Berlin meant as temporary housing for any unfortunate employees who were on extended duties that required them to be close to their work. She, or, rather, her then-guardian Ryoji Kaji, had secured her the room for permanent use after one too many long days of training and testing had left her feeling too exhausted to make the trek out to her father's house, only to wake up a few scant hours later to repeat the process over again.  
如果这就是来世，那他妈的算我倒霉，她想着，猛地关上了她一直在翻找的抽屉。我拼了命地拯救世界，结果得到的回报就是被送回柏林这个破地方？无论她是否相信眼前所见是真实的，她认出了自己所在的房间。NERV-柏林中心的一个小工作室式生活区，原本是为那些不幸需要长时间值班、不得不靠近工作的员工提供的临时住所。她，或者说，她的当时的监护人碇源堂，在她经历了太多漫长的训练和测试，感到筋疲力尽，无法再跋涉到父亲家，只能短暂休息几个小时后又要重复这一切之后，为她争取了这个房间的永久使用权。

_I wanted him to let me live with him,_ she thought wistfully as she took in the paltry sights of her old living space. A bed, the vanity she was currently leaning against, a closet, a small cooking area with a stove, a microwave, a sink, and some meager counter space, a door leading to a bathroom, and the exit. _Instead, I got this hovel. I guess it was better than being around that woman and being ignored by Papa. Well, hell, purgatory, heaven, or whatever this is, I'm done sitting around doing nothing._ Seeing the time on the digital clock on the vanity, Asuka stepped into the bathroom to start the shower and begin getting ready to find answers. _0430, good. If this really is just like Berlin, I can talk to someone who might know what's going on around here before the morning tests start._ She laughed aloud at that thought.  
我多希望他能让我和他一起生活，她带着一丝憧憬想着，同时环视着自己旧居的简陋景象。一张床，她此刻倚靠的梳妆台，一个衣柜，一个带炉子、微波炉、水槽和少许操作台的小厨房，一扇通往浴室的门，还有出口。然而，我却得到了这么个破地方。我想，总比在那女人身边被爸爸忽视要好。好吧，地狱、炼狱、天堂，或是别的什么，我受够了无所事事地坐着。看到梳妆台上数字钟显示的时间，明日香走进浴室，启动淋浴，开始准备寻找答案。0430，不错。如果这里真的和柏林一样，我可以在早上的测试开始前找个人聊聊，看看这里到底发生了什么。想到这里，她不禁笑出声来。

"What tests? I'm the only pilot here and I'm dead." With that statement hanging in the air, she shirked her sleepwear and began her morning routine.  
"什么测试？我是这里唯一的驾驶员，而且我已经死了。" 说完这句话，她脱下睡衣，开始了早晨的例行程序。

Ω

Freshly washed, primped, and dressed in one of her red plugsuits with a light jacket, Asuka stepped out of her room at 0600 and began making her way toward the offices of some of the doctors and directors that she remembered as being easy to pester into compliance with her various whims. The confidence she had initially felt when she decided to set out was beginning to wane as she passed the occasional NERV employee making their way into work; their faces were not necessarily familiar but certainly not alien, bringing with them an odd sense of déjà vu. _It wouldn't feel out of place if I saw the Idiot wandering around lost with those stupid headphones in his ears._ She clamped down on her uneasiness and pushed on along the long corridors of NERV to her destination but doubt still beset her. _What am I even going to ask them? 'Hey, I died in Japan and now I'm here, what's up with that?' That'll go ever well._  
刚洗完澡，打扮整齐，穿着她那件红色的插电服并披上轻便夹克，明日香在 0600 时分走出房间，开始向她记忆中那些容易被她纠缠到顺从她各种奇思妙想的医生和主任的办公室走去。当她决定出发时最初感受到的自信，随着她偶尔经过一些正赶去上班的 NERV 员工而开始减弱；他们的面孔虽不熟悉，但也绝非陌生，带来一种奇怪的似曾相识感。如果看到那个白痴戴着他那副愚蠢的耳机四处游荡，也不会觉得突兀。她压制住内心的不安，沿着 NERV 长长的走廊继续前行，但疑虑依旧困扰着她。我到底要问他们什么呢？‘嘿，我在日本死了，现在我在这里，这是怎么回事？’那样的话，进展会顺利吗？

"Don't worry about that," she said to herself softly, yet firmly. "You'll figure it out when you get there."  
“别担心，”她轻声但坚定地对自己说，“到时候你会弄明白的。”

"Figure what out?" She heard from behind her. It was a voice she had not heard for weeks, maybe months, and one that she had been desperate to hear–more than anything she had needed to hear that voice and see the man it belonged to as she had lost control of her life and everything she held dear slipped away from her. She stopped in her tracks and turned to face the man that she knew to be just as dead as she was–_currently am,_ she corrected–and felt hot tears behind her eyes threatening to fall free.  
“搞清楚什么？”她听到身后传来声音。那是她已有数周、或许数月未曾听闻的嗓音，一个她迫切渴望听到的声音——比任何时候都更需要听到这声音，看到这声音的主人，因为在她失去对生活的掌控，所有珍视之物渐行渐远时，她曾几近崩溃。她停下脚步，转身面对那个她明知与自己同样已死——或者说，目前算是已死——的男人，眼中热泪盈眶，几欲夺眶而出。

"Kaji?" Asuka almost whispered, her eyes taking in his perpetually disheveled appearance: a rumpled blue shirt with the top button undone and loose tie, sleeves pushed up his to his forearms, long hair pulled back into a ponytail, and a light scruff of beard along his cheeks and jaw to complete the look.  
“加持？”明日香几乎低语道，目光打量着他那永远凌乱的外表：皱巴巴的蓝色衬衫，最上面的扣子未扣，领带松散，袖子卷到前臂，长发束成马尾，脸颊和下巴上留着淡淡的胡茬，构成了这副模样。

"The one and only," he smirked. It was then that he noticed her reaction to him, the quavering eyes and look of what he could almost call shock on her face. His own face turned serious and took on a look of concern. "Hey, kiddo, what's wro-_oof_," he wumphed, as Asuka tackled him into a hug and buried her face in his chest, continuing to fight back tears. While accustomed to Asuka's overeager affection for him, the man was not prepared for this kind of assault on his person and was taken more than a bit off-guard. Gingerly, he placed one hand on the girl's shoulder and used the other to gently rub her back.  
"独一无二的那一个，" 他微微一笑。就在这时，他注意到了她的反应，颤抖的眼神和脸上几乎可以说是震惊的表情。他自己的表情变得严肃，露出了关切的神色。"嘿，小家伙，怎么了——呃，" 他闷哼一声，因为明日香扑上来紧紧抱住他，把脸埋在他的胸前，继续强忍着泪水。虽然习惯了明日香对他过度的亲昵，但这个男人并没有准备好应对这种对他个人的突袭，完全出乎意料。他小心翼翼地用一只手放在女孩的肩膀上，另一只手轻轻地抚摸她的背。

"What's wrong, Asuka?" He asked quietly, painfully aware of the girl's tendency to bury her problems rather than discuss them with anyone else. "Talk to me, kiddo."  
"怎么了，明日香？" 他轻声问道，痛苦地意识到女孩倾向于把问题埋在心里，而不是和任何人讨论。"跟我说说，小家伙。"

"I'm ok, Kaji," Asuka lied, her voice muffled by his shirt. She took a second to compose herself and, when she was certain she was no longer about to start leaking from the eyes–_like the Idiot whenever things don't go his way_, the thought slipped into her mind–she put on her best smile and pulled away from Kaji so she could look up into his face. "Just had a long night. I feel like I haven't seen you in forever!" _Dead, just like me, just like Mama, just like those men I killed, the Idiot tried to tell me weeks ago but I refused to believe him_.  
"我没事，加持。" 明日香撒谎道，声音被他的衬衫闷住。她花了一会儿时间整理情绪，确保自己不再有流泪的冲动——就像那个白痴每次事情不如意时那样，这个念头不经意间闪过她的脑海——她露出最灿烂的笑容，从加持的怀抱中挣脱，抬头望向他的脸。"只是度过了一个漫长的夜晚。我感觉好像很久没见到你了！" 死了，就像我一样，就像妈妈一样，就像那些我杀掉的人一样，那个白痴几周前试图告诉我，但我拒绝相信他。

A look of concern still on his face, Kaji gave her shoulder a light squeeze. "Well, here I am. And here you are." His familiar smirk returned to his face. "Perfect timing, too. I stopped by your room to pick you up, but you were already gone. I take it you heard the news?"  
加持的脸上仍带着关切的神情，轻轻捏了捏她的肩膀。"好吧，我在这里。你也在这里。" 他熟悉的坏笑又回到了脸上。"时机恰到好处。我去了你的房间接你，但你已经不在了。我猜你已经听到了消息？"

_That it turns out dying is no big deal?_ "What news?" She asked, turning an eyebrow up at the man. "I was just heading in to-uh." _Come on, don't tell him about your insane problem yet, think of something normal sounding to tell him._ "Speak to some techs before we start testing today." _Real smooth, Asuka. Maybe he doesn't think you're crazy, yet, but he definitely knows you're hiding something._  
原来死亡也没什么大不了的？“什么消息？”她问道，挑眉看向那人。“我正打算去——呃。”别急着告诉他你的疯狂问题，想个听起来正常点的理由。“在今天开始测试前先和一些技术人员聊聊。”真顺滑，明日香。也许他还没觉得你疯了，但他肯定知道你在隐瞒什么。

Kaji chuckled. "Still trying to get them to pipe in music for your synch tests? Good luck with that," he said, letting the girl go and resuming his walk down the corridor. He motioned for her to follow along, and she did. "We've got bigger business than that, though. The big day is finally here."  
加持轻笑一声。“还在试图让他们为同步测试接入音乐吗？祝你好运，”他说着，放开了女孩，继续沿着走廊走去。他示意她跟上，她照做了。“不过我们有更重要的事。重要的日子终于到了。”

"Big day?" She asked. _I've had a pretty big year, actually, I don't need a big day right after I just woke up dead._  
“重要的日子？”她问。实际上，这一年已经够重大的了，我刚从死里复活，不需要再来一个重要日子。

"Just got word from Tokyo-III. UN forces are preparing to intercept an Angel that's inbound on the NERV base there." Kaji began leading her down turns and hallways away from the offices she had initially been heading to and towards the operations center of NERV-Berlin. "NERV analysts predict that conventional forces will fail to repel the Angel, and an Evangelion will need to sortie to defeat it. We're about to watch the first combat test of an Eva."  
刚刚收到来自东京-III 的消息。联合国部队正准备拦截一个正向 NERV 基地袭来的使徒。" 加持开始引领她穿过转角和走廊，远离她最初前往的办公室，朝着 NERV-柏林的作战中心走去。"NERV 分析师预测常规部队将无法击退使徒，需要出动 EVA 才能将其击败。我们即将见证 EVA 的首次实战测试。

Asuka felt her eyes widen and the color drain from her face. Her legs kept moving on autopilot as she followed Kaji to their destination, but she was no longer conscious of where she was going. The mild unease she had felt before, the levity as she had joked with herself about being dead and going crazy, the astonishment and relief she had felt upon being with Kaji again, they all felt like they had been a dream, or perhaps someone else's emotions. This was the first thing that had felt solid and real to her since she had woken up, even compared to being comforted by Kaji.  
明日香感到自己的眼睛瞪大，脸色变得苍白。她的双腿自动跟随加持前往目的地，但她已不再意识到自己身在何处。之前那种轻微的不安，她对自己死亡和发疯的玩笑，以及与加持重逢时的惊讶和宽慰，这一切都感觉像是一场梦，或者是别人的情绪。这是自她醒来后，第一个让她感到真实和确切的事情，甚至比得到加持的安慰还要真实。

"An Angel?" She whispered, too quiet for even Kaji to hear her. _No. No, no, no. No no no no no no no. No._ She forced herself to take a deep breath and push through her rising anxiety. _This is not happening,_ she thought, anger beginning to supplant her panic. Anger at herself, for losing control; at Kaji, for telling her about this; at NERV, for having poorly designed bases that force people to walk for miles just to get anywhere; at the world, for daring to put her through this again. Anger at everything, for having to audacity to exist when she so clearly was through with all of this bullshit.  
“一个天使？”她低语，声音轻得连加持都听不见。不。不，不，不。不不不不不不不。不。她强迫自己深吸一口气，压下不断升起的焦虑。这不是真的，她想，愤怒开始取代她的恐慌。生自己的气，因为失去了控制；生加持的气，因为他告诉了她这件事；生 NERV 的气，因为他们设计糟糕的基地迫使人们步行数英里才能到达任何地方；生这个世界的气，因为它竟敢再次让她经历这一切。对一切的愤怒，因为它们竟敢在她显然已经受够了这些狗屎的时候存在。

Anger was better than panic. Anger was an old ally for Asuka, a weapon to keep others at bay, a shield to cover her weaknesses, a tool to help her move forward. _I am not doing all of that again. I refuse to just accept this._ Her face locked into a scowl as she resumed walking with purpose. _If the universe wants to play fucking games with me, then bring it on. I'm the Great Asuka Langley Soryu. Real or not, I'm fighting my way through this._  
愤怒比恐慌好。愤怒是明日香的老朋友，是一种让别人保持距离的武器，是一面掩盖她弱点的盾牌，是一个帮助她前进的工具。我不会再做所有那些事了。我拒绝就这样接受。她的脸上带着怒容，重新迈步前行，充满决心。如果宇宙想跟我玩这些该死的游戏，那就来吧。我是伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷。无论是真是假，我都要战斗着走过去。

"Well, then," Asuka snarled as they neared the operations center with its banks of workstations, monitors, maps, communications arrays, and all manner of technological clutter that let NERV function. "Let's see what their mediocre excuse for a pilot can do, so I'll know what I'm working with when I get to show them all up."  
“那么，”他们接近操作中心，那里排列着工作站、显示器、地图、通信阵列以及各种让 NERV 运作的技术杂乱物，明日香咆哮道，“让我们看看他们那平庸的飞行员能做什么，这样我就能知道当我让他们全都相形见绌时，我面对的是什么。”

Ω

Anger, it seemed, could only carry one so far. Or at least only carry one certain pilot so far. While the NERV facility remained a hive of anxious activity, very little had happened since the initial warning of the threat being spotted. Asuka was leaning against one of the less busy terminals with her arms crossed and eyes fixed on the blip on the holographic map that represented the Angel as it made its way towards the Geofront. Her face was set in a scowl, and she was drumming her fingers against her bicep.  
愤怒似乎只能带人走这么远。或者至少只能带某个特定的飞行员走这么远。尽管 NERV 设施仍是一片焦虑的忙碌景象，但在最初的威胁被发现的警告之后，几乎没有发生什么事情。明日香靠在一个不那么繁忙的终端上，双臂交叉，眼睛盯着全息地图上代表天使朝地底都市前进的光点。她的脸上带着怒容，手指敲打着她的二头肌。

"It should at least have the decency to not keep us waiting," she muttered. _Of course my personal hell would include sitting around twiddling my thumbs waiting for something to happen. This was bad enough when I had to do it for real, but at least then I insisted on skipping out on the voyeurism and doing more simulation training. Now I'm here waiting for the Idiot to get into the Eva._  
"至少它应该有点礼貌，别让我们等太久，"她喃喃自语。当然，我的个人地狱包括坐在这里无所事事，等待某事发生。这在现实中已经够糟糕了，但至少那时我坚持跳过偷窥行为，进行更多的模拟训练。现在我在这里等着那个白痴进入 Eva。

"The more time it spends not actively destroying things, the better, Asuka," Kaji remarked from his spot next to her. He'd been making the rounds through the operations center, peaking over shoulders and reading unattended papers, before settling next to his charge with a can of iced coffee in hand. "Word is the Central Branch is having trouble with their pilot."  
"它不主动搞破坏的时间越长越好，明日香，"加持从她旁边的位置上说道。他一直在操作中心四处走动，越过肩膀窥视，阅读无人看管的文件，最后手里拿着一罐冰咖啡坐在他的保护对象旁边。"听说中央支部在他们的驾驶员身上遇到了麻烦。"

Asuka scoffed. "Serves them right," she said. "They're the ones responsible for delaying the last of the production on Unit 02, probably on some stupid vanity project like putting a naval destroyer in an underground lake. I could be in Tokyo-III right now, in my Unit 02, kicking that Angel's ass–if they were smart."  
明日香嗤之以鼻。"活该，"她说。"他们自己负责推迟了 02 号机的最后生产，可能是因为某个愚蠢的虚荣项目，比如把一艘驱逐舰放在地下湖里。我现在本可以在第三新东京市，在我的 02 号机里，痛打那个使徒——如果他们聪明的话。

Kaji quirked an eyebrow at the girl. "Why do you think you and Unit 02 would be in Japan right now if production was finished?" His eyes made a quick scan around the room, but no one was paying them any attention. "Nobody knows where the Angels are going to attack."  
加持对女孩挑了挑眉。“如果生产已经完成，你和二号机现在怎么会还在日本？”他的目光迅速扫视了一圈房间，但没有人注意到他们。“没人知道使徒会攻击哪里。”

_Fuck_, Asuka thought. _I forgot they didn't tell us anything about the Angels before it all started, not even where they were going to attack. They really did keep us in the dark. Don't give yourself away, no need to let anyone think you're crazy._ "Well–it just makes sense," she replied, putting on a haughty tone and waving her hand at the maps and screens on display. "The Central Branch is there, all those defenses are built into the city, and they've got the only other two Eva units stationed there. Of course NERV expects the Angels to attack there." She risked a surreptitious glance to Kaji to see if he had bought her explanation and saw the man scratching the back of his head and smirking, letting out a small chuckle.  
该死，明日香心想。我忘了他们一开始根本没告诉我们关于使徒的任何信息，甚至连它们会攻击哪里都没说。他们真的把我们蒙在鼓里。别露馅，没必要让任何人觉得你疯了。“嗯——这很合理，”她回答道，摆出一副傲慢的语气，挥手示意展示的地图和屏幕。“中央支部在那里，城市里布满了防御工事，而且那里还驻扎着另外两台 EVA。NERV 当然会预料使徒会攻击那里。”她偷偷瞥了一眼加持，想看看他是否相信了她的解释，看到他挠着后脑勺，咧嘴一笑，轻声笑了出来。

"I suppose there's no fooling you, Asuka," he said. "Don't tell anyone I told you, but that is pretty much exactly what NERV suspects will happen. In fact, you're going to be–"  
“我想骗不了你，明日香，”他说道，“别告诉任何人是我告诉你的，但 NERV 确实差不多就是这么猜测的。事实上，你将会——”

"Eva Unit 01 has launched!" One of the analysts yelled out from his station, tearing everyone's attention to the cameras trained on the launch platform in use.  
"Eva 初号机已发射！" 一名分析员从他的岗位上喊道，将所有人的注意力吸引到对准发射平台的摄像头上。

"Finally," Asuka growled. "Now I can see what the Idiot is capable of."  
"终于，" 明日香咆哮道。"现在我倒要看看那个白痴能搞出什么名堂。

Ω

"Did–did no one teach him how to walk?!" Asuka balked at the huge screen displaying Unit 01's first steps–first tumbles, really–towards the approaching threat of the Angel, which the screens had helpfully labelled as "Sachiel." _I thought they said the Idiot beat this Angel easily._  
"他——他没人教他怎么走路吗？！" 明日香瞪着那块巨大的屏幕，上面正播放着初号机迈出第一步——实际上是第一次跌倒——朝着逼近的使徒前进的画面，屏幕贴心地标注着"萨基尔"。我记得他们说这白痴轻松打败了这个使徒啊。

Kaji's face was still straightening out from the sympathetic wince it had twisted into upon seeing Unit 01 fall face-first onto the streets of Tokyo-III. "Well, he was just brought in earlier today."

"NERV really is irresponsible with its pilots, isn't it," Asuka said quietly. "How is he supposed to fight if he can't walk?!" This much louder statement was directed at no one in particular, but many of the people in the operations center seemed to be in agreement with her sentiment if the worried looks on their faces were to be believed. _Is this how it really happened? What the hell is going on? I really should have watched this sortie when I was alive!_  
"NERV 对他们的驾驶员真是太不负责任了，" 明日香低声说道，"如果他连走路都不会，还怎么战斗？！" 这句大声的质问并没有针对任何人，但操作中心里的许多人似乎都赞同她的看法，从他们脸上的担忧表情就能看出来。这真的是当时的情况吗？到底发生了什么？我真该在我还活着的时候看看这次出击的！

Sachiel, as it turned out, was done making its audience wait and had quickly moved on the fallen opponent, picking Unit 01 up by its head and lifting it high enough for its feet to dangle off the ground.  
结果发现，Sachiel 已经不再让观众等待，迅速转向倒地的对手，用头部将初号机提起，使其双脚悬空离地。

"Come on, Idiot, do something! Why are you so passive? I know you can do better than this!" Asuka was now even more engrossed in the fight than she thought she would have been, drawn in by the horrible realization that, regardless of how she remembered this fight as having supposed to have gone, Shinji was clearly going to lose. She belatedly realized that she should not have said what she just had out loud. Luckily for her, she did not need to explain her slightly out of place commentary as the general noise of the operations center, combined with the audio feeds of the battle being piped into the room, made overhearing anything quieter than a shout mostly impossible. Only her guardian would have been likely to have heard her, and he was seemingly just as tuned into the fight as everyone else.  
“快点，笨蛋，做点什么！你为什么这么被动？我知道你能做得更好！” 明日香现在比她预想的更加投入这场战斗，被一个可怕的现实吸引：不管她如何记得这场战斗应该是怎样进行的，真嗣显然要输了。她后知后觉地意识到自己不该大声说出刚才的话。幸运的是，她不需要解释这略显突兀的评论，因为指挥中心的嘈杂声加上房间内播放的战斗音频，使得听到比喊声更小的声音几乎不可能。只有她的监护人可能会听到，而他似乎和其他人一样专注于战斗。

Sachiel was now driving some sort of lance directly into Unit 01's eye through into its skull, making Asuka wince in sympathy. She brought a hand up to her own eye that should not be there and felt the phantom flood of blood and viscera run through her fingers and down her face. She shuddered as the Angel continued its assault and Unit 01 did nothing to defend itself.  
萨基尔此刻正将某种长枪直接刺入零号机的眼睛，贯穿其头骨，这让明日香感同身受地皱起了眉。她抬起手，触碰着本不该存在的自己的眼睛，感受到幻觉中涌出的血液和脑浆穿过指间，顺着脸颊流下。她颤抖着，看着使徒继续攻击，而零号机却毫无防御之意。

"The pilot is unconscious! Eva Unit 01 deactivating!" Came a cry from one of the analysts.  
“驾驶员失去意识！零号机即将停机！”一名分析员喊道。

_Well, either they launch Wondergirl in Unit 00, or we're all done in this go around,_ Asuka thought. _At least the Idiot doesn't have to suffer through the rest of the fight. Maybe this time I'll stay dead._ The young pilot sighed and closed her eyes.  
好吧，要么他们启动零号机的奇迹少女，要么我们就此完蛋，明日香心想。至少那个白痴不用再忍受剩下的战斗了。也许这次我能真正死去。年轻的驾驶员叹了口气，闭上了眼睛。

"Pilot's synch rate is rising! Eva Unit 01 is reactivating!" Came another cry from possibly the same analyst.  
“驾驶员同步率正在上升！EVA 初号机正在重新启动！” 可能是同一位分析员的声音再次响起。

Asuka's eyes tore open just in time to witness Unit 01 reach up to grasp Sachiel's wrists and snap the Angel's arms like twigs, causing it to drop Unit 01 and retreat a distance away. The Eva quickly advanced on its foe, its movements animalistic and inhuman. Asuka furrowed her brow at the sight of Unit 01 tearing into Sachiel's AT field and ripping parts of the Angel off of itself to use as a weapon to slam down on its core. _I've seen Unit 01 act like this before_, she thought, _and that is not the Idiot in control of that monster_. Unit 01 continued to bash against the Angel's core as Asuka wracked her memory to identify how she recognized Unit 01's erratic movements.  
就在这时，明日香的眼睛猛地睁开，正好目睹初号机抬起手抓住萨基尔的手腕，像折断树枝一样将其双臂折断，迫使天使松开初号机并后退了一段距离。EVA 迅速逼近对手，其动作野蛮且非人。明日香皱起眉头，看着初号机撕裂萨基尔的 AT 力场，并从天使身上撕下部分躯体作为武器，猛击其核心。我以前见过初号机这样行动，她想，控制那怪物的绝不是那个白痴。初号机继续猛击天使的核心，而明日香则在记忆中搜寻，试图识别出她对初号机异常动作的熟悉感从何而来。

_The recordings of the battle against the 14__th_ _Angel,_ she recalled, _I must have watched those a hundred times when he was stuck inside Unit 01._ _What did Misato say when she saw the Eva tearing into the Angel?_ "Berserker," Asuka said quietly to herself.  
她回忆起与第 14 使徒战斗的录像，我一定看过那些录像上百次，当时他被困在初号机里。当看到 EVA 撕裂使徒时，美里说了什么？“狂战士，”明日香轻声自语道。

By that point, Sachiel had wrapped itself around Unit 01 and the analysts were warning of an increased energy reading coming from the Angel. Asuka, however, was no longer concerned with the fight. She turned to face Kaji, who had remained next to her watching the fight, as the Angel exploded and Unit 01 emerged unharmed. "Kaji?"  
"那时，萨基尔已经缠绕在初号机周围，分析师们警告说天使的能量读数正在上升。然而，惣流已不再关注这场战斗。她转向面对着一直陪在她身边观看战斗的加持，当天使爆炸而初号机毫发无损地出现时，她轻声唤道：“加持？””

Her guardian turned his head to face her, his face set in a mask of disbelief. "Yeah, kiddo?"  
"她的守护者转过头来面对她，脸上带着难以置信的表情。“嗯，小家伙？””

"That was an absolute fucking disaster."  
““那真是一场彻头彻尾的灾难。””

"Yeah, kiddo," he replied.  
“是啊，孩子，”他回答道。

### Chapter 2

Επί δείπνα των φίλων βραδέως πορεύου, επί δε τας ατυχίας ταχέως (Don't rush when attending friends' dinners, instead hasten to their misfortunes) – Attributed to Chilon of Sparta, 6th Century BCE  
友宴徐行，不幸疾至（参加朋友宴会时宜缓步而行，而面对他们的不幸则应迅速相助）——据传为斯巴达的基伦所言，公元前 6 世纪

"What do you mean _no_?!" Asuka demanded of the man who was looking rather frustrated with the young woman who had barged into his office moments ago and began demanding things.  
"你什么意思，不？!" 明日香对那个男人质问道，他看起来对几分钟前闯进他办公室并开始提出要求的年轻女子颇为恼火。

"I _mean_, Pilot Soryu, that both Evangelion Unit 02 and you belong here with NERV-Berlin. The Central branch has their own resources at their disposal, we have no reason to send them ours."  
"我的意思是，Soryu 驾驶员，EVA 二号机和你都属于 NERV-柏林。中央支部有自己的资源，我们没有理由把我们的资源送过去。"

"_Their own resources_?" She growled back to him. "Did you watch Unit 01's sortie against the Angel?" _Because that was definitely Unit 01 that won the fight, the Third does not fight like that._ "We're lucky that–"  
"他们自己的资源？" 她咆哮着回应，"你看了零号机对使徒的出击吗？因为那绝对是零号机赢得了战斗，三号机不会那样战斗。"我们很幸运——"

Asuka was cut off by the office door _whooshing_ open behind her, her guardian stepping through. "We're lucky that things worked out just fine in the end. Come on, Asuka, leave Doctor Vogel here to his work. Let's take a walk." He gestured out the door behind him, pointedly ignoring the thankful look the man in question shot his way.  
明日香被身后办公室门的呼啸声打断，她的监护人走了进来。“我们很幸运，最终一切都很顺利。来吧，明日香，让博士沃格尔留在这里继续他的工作。我们出去走走。”他指了指身后的门，故意忽略了博士投来的感激目光。

Asuka herself placed her hands on her hips and narrowed her eyes at the doctor. "We're not finished here." Turning to leave and linking her arm through Kaji's, she led him out the door and into the hallway, choosing the path towards the cafeteria. In the chaos of watching the fight yesterday, and her immediate need to start twisting some ears of the higher ups around the facility, she'd neglected to have more than a soda from a vending machine she knew to be broken and easily pilfered from. _A nice meal with Kaji will be just what I need to calm down_, she thought.  
明日香自己双手叉腰，眯起眼睛盯着博士。“我们还没完呢。”转身离开，手臂挽着加持，她领着他走出办公室，进入走廊，选择前往食堂的路。昨天观看战斗的混乱，以及她立即需要开始对设施高层进行耳提面命，让她忽略了除了从一台她知道已经坏了且容易偷窃的自动售货机里拿的汽水之外，几乎没有进食。她想，和加持一起吃顿美餐正是我需要的，可以让我平静下来。

"So, I take it you haven't had much luck?" Her guardian asked her.  
“那么，看来你没什么进展？”她的监护人问她。

"No," she sighed, already some of the tension and anger bleeding away from her. "I already tried with anyone of any importance in Operations, but they're all convinced that Captain Katsuragi put me up to this so she can steal their pilot training regimen. As if we've even spoken since she was my 'guardian.'" At this mention of her current guardian's old flame, Asuka paid close attention to Kaji's face to see if he would react.  
"不，"她叹了口气，紧张和愤怒的情绪已经开始消散。"我已经试过和操作部门任何有影响力的人谈了，但他们都认为葛城美里上尉指使我这么做，好窃取他们的飞行员训练计划。好像自从她成为我的'监护人'后，我们还有过交流似的。"提到她现任监护人的旧情人时，明日香特别留意了加持的脸色，看他是否会有所反应。

His face, however, remained unchanged; the smirk he almost permanently had plastered on did not even twitch at the name. "I don't think that's her style, no," he replied. "Besides, their training is designed for a pilot to start as young as possible. Both of the other two Children are your age already."  
然而，他的表情毫无变化；那几乎永远挂在他脸上的微笑甚至没有因为这个名字而抽动一下。"我不认为那是她的风格，不，"他回答道。"再说，他们的训练是为尽可能年轻的飞行员设计的。其他两个孩子都已经和你同龄了。"

"I know that, and so do they," Asuka said exasperatedly. "But they're a bunch of stubborn idiots. So, I moved on to Doctor Vogel and his lackeys in Project E." By this point, the pair had reached the cafeteria and grabbed trays. Asuka picked food items mostly at random, with Kaji opting for a bowl of inoffensive _something_ to go with his usual can of iced coffee. Their conversation continued as they made their way to a table.  
"我知道，他们也知道，"明日香恼火地说。"但他们就是一群顽固的白痴。所以，我转而去找了沃格尔博士和他的项目 E 的跟班们。"到这时，两人已经到达了食堂并拿了托盘。明日香随意挑选了一些食物，而加持则选择了一碗无害的什么东西，搭配他常喝的冰咖啡。他们边聊边走向一张桌子，继续他们的对话。

"And _he's_ only concerned about the budget and resources, apparently. As if you can proscribe a budget to saving the world," she said bitterly while beginning to pick at her food. She almost immediately regretted not paying closer attention to what she had chosen to eat, but her stubbornness refused to let her not start eating anyway.  
"而他似乎只关心预算和资源。好像拯救世界还能有个预算似的，"她苦涩地说着，开始挑拣自己的食物。她几乎立刻就后悔没有更仔细地选择吃什么，但她的倔强让她无论如何都要开始吃。

"Have you considered trying a different approach?" Kaji asked her, not bothering with his own food.  
"你有没有考虑过换个方法？"加持问她，自己却没动食物。

"Go straight to the director? I thought of that, and I think that's what I'm going to do next," Asuka replied, suppressing a grimace at the cafeteria fare as she brought a forkful of it up to her lips.  
"直接去找总监？我想过这个，而且我觉得下一步就该这么做，"明日香回答，一边将一叉子食堂的食物送到嘴边，强忍着对这顿饭的不满。

"No, not that," he chuckled. "You've tried a direct approach–now try something a little more subtle."  
"不，不是那个，"他轻声笑道，"你试过直接的方法了——现在试试更微妙一点的吧。"

"Winning a fight requires boldness and violence of action," Asuka declared haughtily, _hmmph_ing at the idea of subtlety. "I know you have your politics, but I'm the Second Child, Kaji. Designated pilot of Evangelion Unit 02." _Subtlety didn't kill those Angels I killed. It didn't wipe out the Eva Series while running on almost no power, even if they did cheat and get back up. Hell, even in bizzarro world here I still have a university degree and am the top Eva pilot at the age of 13–subtlety had nothing to do with that._  
"赢得战斗需要大胆和行动的猛烈，"明日香傲慢地宣称，对微妙的想法嗤之以鼻。"我知道你有你的政治手腕，但我是二号适格者，加持。EVA 二号机的指定驾驶员。"微妙并没有杀死我杀死的那些使徒。它没有在几乎没电的情况下消灭 EVA 系列，即使他们作弊并重新站起来。见鬼，即使在这个颠倒的世界里，我仍然拥有大学学位，并且在 13 岁时成为顶尖的 EVA 驾驶员——这与微妙无关。"

Kaji's face softened a bit at hearing Asuka's proclamation. "Not everything is a battle to the death against a clear and present danger, kiddo," he said softly. "And sometimes, it's the politics that are the real danger." He shook his head and held a hand up in supplication. "What I mean is, it's never too late to learn a new skill right?"  
听到明日香的宣言，加持的脸色稍微柔和了一些。"并非所有事情都是与明确且迫在眉睫的危险进行生死搏斗，孩子，"他轻声说，"有时候，真正的危险在于政治。"他摇了摇头，举起一只手表示投降。"我的意思是，学习新技能永远不会太晚，对吧？"

He gave her an obliging look, and Asuka obliged with a sigh and a muttered "I suppose."  
他给了她一个顺从的眼神，而明日香则叹了口气，低声咕哝了一句：“我想也是。”

Kaji grinned. "Great," he said. "So, the subtle approach–it's about poking around, finding your opponent's weak spots, using what you know against them, all ideally without them even knowing you've done anything." Kaji explained, loosening his already loosened tie. "You may have already shown your hand, but that doesn't mean we can't still win this one."  
加持咧嘴一笑。“太好了，”他说，“那么，微妙的策略——就是四处探查，找出对手的弱点，利用你所知道的信息对付他们，最好让他们完全不知道你做了什么。”加持解释道，松开了本已松开的领带。“你可能已经亮出了底牌，但这并不意味着我们不能赢得这一局。”

"_We_?" Asuka asked incredulously, raising an eyebrow at the man. "I can do this myself you know. I don't need anyone's help." Memories, or at least what she had to assume were memories because she hadn't yet unraveled exactly what had happened that brought her to where she currently was, ran through her head of her saying similar things to the Third Child, to Misato, to anyone who was within earshot during her time in Japan. Most of them were not pleasant memories. _That was different_, she insisted to herself. _I_ have _to do it right this time._  
“我们？”明日香难以置信地问道，扬起眉毛看着那人。“我自己能行，不需要任何人的帮助。”一些记忆，或者至少是她认为的记忆，因为她还没有完全弄清楚是什么事情将她带到了现在的境地，在她脑海中闪过，她曾对第三适格者、对美里，以及在日本期间任何在听的人说过类似的话。其中大多数记忆并不愉快。但她坚持认为，这次不同。我这次必须做对。

"Hey, I'm on your side," Kaji said placatingly. "There's no weakness in asking for help; sometimes, people have different skill sets, or are in a better position to make something happen. You said it yourself, right?" He gestured at himself. "I can schmooze with the higher ranks, but," and here he gestured to Asuka, "I'm certainly no Eva pilot, definitely not one of your caliber."  
"嘿，我是站在你这边的，" 加持安抚地说道，"寻求帮助并不代表软弱；有时候，人们拥有不同的技能，或者处于更有利的位置来促成某事。你自己不也说过吗？" 他指了指自己，"我能与高层打交道，但，" 说到这里，他转向明日香，"我绝对不是 Eva 驾驶员，更别提像你这样的高手了。"

Asuka narrowed her eyes and pursed her lips at the man, letting her tray of food go unattended. _I would have killed to hear him compliment my piloting like that just a few weeks ago_, she thought, _but now I don't even care. What the hell is wrong with me? Besides maybe being dead, that is._  
明日香眯起眼睛，对着这个男人撅起嘴唇，任由她的餐盘无人照看。如果是在几周前，我可能会因为听到他这样称赞我的驾驶技术而欣喜若狂，她想，但现在我甚至不在乎了。我到底是怎么了？除了可能已经死了这一点之外。

"Fine," she finally relented. "Help from other people. I'll see how it goes–this time, anyway."  
"好吧，" 她最终让步了，"接受别人的帮助。我会看看这次效果如何。"

"Ok, that's a start, I suppose," Kaji replied, shaking his head slightly. "So, where do you think we should begin with your new, subtle approach?"  
"好吧，这算是个开始，我想，" 加持回答道，轻轻摇了摇头。"那么，你认为我们应该从你的新策略——那个微妙的方法——从哪里开始呢？"

Bringing a hand to her chin in thought, Asuka pondered the dilemma. "I still think Operations is the best place to start, but I'm not going to be able to budge them on the whole 'jealous of anyone stealing their training regimen and their pilot' thing they've got going on."  
明日香用手托着下巴，陷入沉思。"我还是觉得从操作部门开始最好，但我恐怕无法说服他们放弃那种'嫉妒任何人抢走他们的训练计划和飞行员'的心态。"

"I agree with you on starting with Ops. But how would they be convinced to send you to Japan? There's got to be someone with more authority than them who can put in for a transfer, right?" Kaji asked leadingly.  
"我同意从操作部门开始。但你怎么能让他们同意把你送到日本去呢？总得有个比他们更有权威的人能提出调动申请吧？" 加持引导性地问道。"

Asuka snapped her fingers. "Of course! They're worried Misato wants to steal their secrets, that must mean she could potentially do that!" Asuka grinned at the realization. "I should be able to convince her she needs me there to whip their pilots into shape, and then she can make the transfer herself." _Even that loose alcoholic should be able to see that my expertise is necessary. It's a wonder why they took so long to transfer me in the first place._  
"明日香打了个响指。“当然！他们担心美里想窃取他们的秘密，这肯定意味着她有可能做到！”明日香为自己的领悟咧嘴一笑。“我应该能说服她，她需要我在那里训练他们的飞行员，然后她就可以自己进行转移。”即便是那个散漫的酒鬼，也应该能看出我的专业知识是必要的。真奇怪他们为什么这么久才把我调过来。”

"That's a good track, but there's more to be done, I'm sure," he said. "Katsuragi may be convinced that she needs you in Tokyo-III, but what about Unit 02? Production isn't quite finished and it's unlikely to ever be approved for transfer before it's done."  
“那是个不错的计划，但我觉得还有更多要做，”他说。“葛城可能已经相信她需要你在第三新东京市，但二号机怎么办？生产还没完全结束，而且不太可能在完成之前获得转移批准。”

"I know," Asuka said, a bit deflated. "I've thought about that, and the only solution I can see is for me to go to Japan now, and for my Unit 02 to stay here in Berlin until it's finished."  
“我知道，”明日香有些沮丧地说。“我考虑过这个问题，我能想到的唯一解决方案是我现在就去日本，而我的二号机留在柏林，直到它完成。”

Kaji rubbed his perpetually scruffy chin, his face turning grave. "You're really serious about this, aren't you? Leaving your Eva behind, and all." His smirk returned. "Say, this isn't just because the Third Child is a handsome boy your own age, right?"  
加持揉着他那总是胡茬满布的下巴，神情变得严肃。“你是认真的吧？放弃你的 Eva，还有其他一切。”他的嘴角又浮现出笑意。“话说，这不会只是因为第三适格者是个和你同龄的英俊少年吧？”

"_Kaji!_" She yelled while fighting down a blush creeping up her face. _What the hell is wrong with you? I hate that spineless Idiot!_ "What the hell is wrong with you? I hate–I mean, what are you, stupid? By rights we should all be dead right now, because NERV doesn't know how to plan ahead! I'm just trying to fix the problem before it gets worse–before the next Angel shows up." _I can't believe he would imply something between me and the Third!_  
“加持！”她喊道，同时努力压制着脸上泛起的红晕。你到底怎么回事？我讨厌那个没骨气的白痴！“你到底怎么回事？我讨厌——我是说，你是不是傻？按理说我们现在都应该死了，因为 NERV 根本不懂未雨绸缪！我只是想在问题变得更糟之前解决它——在下一个使徒出现之前。”我真不敢相信他会暗示我和第三适格者有什么！

The older man chuckled. "Calm down, Asuka, it was just a joke; an attempt to lighten the mood. Sorry, I'll try to take this a little more seriously."  
年长的男人轻声笑道。“冷静点，明日香，只是个玩笑；试图缓和一下气氛。抱歉，我会试着更认真对待这件事。”

"You'd better," she interjected.  
"你最好如此，"她插话道。

"I will," he assured her. "So, moving on. Assuming you can convince Katsuragi that you're needed in Japan ("I can," she interrupted) then we just need to convince the doctor types around here that they don't need you for the final stages of Unit 02's production. That, I think, is something I can help with."  
"我会做到的，"他向她保证。"那么，继续。假设你能说服葛城让你回日本（"我能做到，"她打断道），接下来我们只需说服这里的医生们，他们不需要你在二号机的最终生产阶段在场。这一点，我想我能帮上忙。"

"You?" Asuka asked. "你？" 明日香问道。

"Me," Kaji replied. "Let me make the rounds, see what I can do. I can be pretty persuasive when I want to be, you know," he said, winking to the girl.  
"我，" 加持回答道。"让我四处打听一下，看看我能做些什么。你知道，当我想要说服别人时，我可是相当有说服力的，" 他向女孩眨了眨眼。

The girl in question sighed quietly. _Once again, something I would have killed for just a few weeks ago, and now it does nothing for me._ "Wait a minute, what about more–help? From other people?" She asked, furrowing her brow in thought. "Doctor A–uh, the doctor in charge of Project E? The actual one in charge, not some regional head? Couldn't we convince them that bringing me to Central would help somehow?" _I'd have no reason to know her name, right?_  
那个女孩轻声叹了口气。又一次，几周前我会为之拼命的东西，现在对我毫无吸引力。"等一下，更多的帮助呢？来自其他人？" 她皱着眉头思考着问道。"A 博士——呃，负责 E 计划的那位医生？真正的主管，不是某个地区负责人？我们能不能说服他们，把我带到中央会有所帮助？" 我没有理由知道她的名字，对吧？

Kaji smiled. "Excellent idea, Asuka. And luckily for you, I just so happen to have an inside line to the esteemed doctor in charge of Project E. Any thoughts on how I could go about persuading her?"  
加持笑了。"好主意，明日香。幸运的是，我恰好和负责 E 计划的尊敬的医生有内部联系。你有什么想法，我该怎么说服她呢？"

"Well," she began, "there's prep work to be done in advance of Unit 02 arriving to Tokyo-III–not just for the Eva, but for me, too. Harmonics and data to establish a baseline, scans and medical exams, those kinds of things. If I get there early, then that means Unit 02 can be operational even sooner once it arrives." _Hold on, when I get there they'll send me to that insufferable school again! No way am I sitting through that boring waste of life a second time!_  
"嗯，"她开始说道，"在 02 号机抵达第三新东京市之前，有很多准备工作要做——不仅是针对 Eva，也包括我自己的。需要建立基线的谐波和数据，扫描和体检，这类事情。如果我早点到那里，那么 02 号机一旦到达就能更快投入运作。"等等，当我到那里时，他们又会把我送到那所令人难以忍受的学校！我绝不会再忍受那无聊至极的浪费生命的课程第二次！

"Plus I can work on the doctor's team when I'm not training or testing!" She hurriedly added. "I may not have majored in metaphysics, but I did take a few classes on it while getting my degree. And no one knows the ins and outs of Unit 02 like I do," she boasted. _Getting to spend more time with my Unit 02,_ and _getting away from those awful lectures on life before Second Impact? That would be the dream._  
"而且，在不训练或测试的时候，我还可以加入博士的团队工作！"她急忙补充道。"虽然我没有主修形而上学，但在获得学位期间我确实上了几门相关的课程。而且没有人比我更了解 02 号机的方方面面，"她自豪地说。能够更多地与我的 02 号机相处，并远离那些关于第二次冲击前生活的糟糕讲座？那简直是梦想成真。

"Hmm," Kaji considered. "That might work. I'll contact our honored doctor, you talk to Katsuragi, and we'll reconvene in a few days. In the meantime, I'll make the rounds around here, see what I can do–and you, before you even think about getting a hold of Katsuragi, when is the last time you slept?" He asked in a tone that, from most anyone else, might be considered stern, but from Kaji just sounded affectionate.  
“嗯，”加持思索着，“这或许可行。我会联系我们尊敬的医生，你和葛城谈谈，几天后我们再碰头。在此期间，我会四处转转，看看能做些什么——而你，在你甚至考虑联系葛城之前，你上次睡觉是什么时候？”他用一种语气问道，如果是别人可能会显得严厉，但从加持口中听起来只是充满关爱。

"Erm, not since before the sortie," Asuka admitted, turning her attention back to her mostly uneaten meal.  
“呃，出任务之前就没睡过了，”明日香承认道，目光转回到她几乎未动过的餐盘上。

"Right. So you're going to get some sleep, then contact Katsuragi." Kaji stood up, collecting his tray of untouched foodstuffs, and reaching for Asuka's too. She let him take it and stood up as well, following him as he made his way out of the cafeteria.  
“好。那你先去睡一觉，然后再联系葛城。”加持站起身，收拾起自己未动过的食物托盘，顺手也拿起了明日香的。她任由他拿走，并跟着站了起来，跟随他一起离开了食堂。

"Sleep first, I get it," she replied. "I'll see you soon, Kaji."  
"先睡吧，我懂了。" 她回答道，"很快再见，加持。"

"See yah, kiddo." "再见，小家伙。"

Ω

Back in her quarters, and with a few hours of restless sleep under her belt, Asuka sat on the edge of her bed holding a notepad, tapping a pen against the pad's surface. _Come on, how hard can this be?_ She thought, biting her lip. _Just explain the basics, she has to be aware of how badly that fight went. Then offer your expert services to train her inferior pilots, perhaps even deign to pilot one of their obsolete models yourself, and that's that. She'll beg you to come to Tokyo-III._  
回到自己的房间，经过几个小时不安稳的睡眠后，明日香坐在床边，手里拿着一个记事本，用笔轻敲着本子的表面。来吧，这能有多难？她想，咬着嘴唇。只需解释基本情况，她必须意识到那场战斗有多糟糕。然后提供你的专业服务，训练她那些不怎么样的飞行员，甚至屈尊亲自驾驶他们那些过时的机型，就这样。她会求你来第三新东京市的。

She tossed the pen and notepad onto the vanity close by to her bed. _No script, I'm doing it live._  
她将笔和笔记本扔到床边的梳妆台上。没有剧本，我要即兴发挥了。

Asuka reached for her NERV issued cell phone on the bed beside her, flipping it open to access her contacts list. Before returning to her room the day before she had tracked down a terminal and accessed the global NERV directory in order to verify that Misato's phone number had remained unchanged in _not-dead land_. Her cell phone number had been as she remembered from her time in Japan, but her apartment's phone number hadn't been listed. Either she was still too newly moved in, or she had never bothered to update her contact information once she had settled in. Either or both seemed likely.  
明日香伸手从床边的床上拿起她的 NERV 发放的手机，翻开盖子查看通讯录。前一天回到房间之前，她找到了一个终端并访问了全球 NERV 目录，以确认美里在未死亡地区的电话号码是否保持不变。她的手机号码和她记忆中在日本时一样，但她的公寓电话号码并未列出。要么是她刚搬进来不久，要么是她搬进来后从未费心更新过联系方式。两者似乎都有可能。

She scrolled down to the second of her two contacts, _M. Katsuragi_, and pressed _dial_. For reasons she didn't quite want to think about, her heartrate was elevated and she was considering putting off her task. _Tough shit, Asuka,_ she thought, as the phone began to ring. _Get over yourself. It's just a phone call, and it's just Misato. What happened before doesn't matter, it hasn't even happened. You're a pilot, your superior officer treated you like a pilot. Not a child. That's what you wanted. Get over yourself._  
她向下滚动到她的两个联系人中的第二个，M. 葛城，然后按下了拨号键。出于一些她不太愿意深思的原因，她的心跳加速了，甚至考虑推迟这项任务。去他的，明日香，她想，当电话开始响起时。别自作多情了。这只是个电话，只是美里。之前发生的事都不重要，甚至还没发生过。你是个驾驶员，你的上级把你当驾驶员对待。不是孩子。那正是你想要的。别自作多情了。

She calmed her breathing as the phone rang a third, fourth, fifth time, and steeled herself for the conversation to come.  
当电话第三次、第四次、第五次响起时，她平静了呼吸，为自己即将进行的对话做好了准备。

"Captain Katsuragi's phone, she's busy at the moment, can I help you?" Came a familiar voice from the receiver, though not the one she expected.  
“葛城上尉的电话，她现在正忙，有什么我可以帮忙的吗？”从听筒里传来一个熟悉的声音，尽管不是她预期的那个。

"Shit," she eloquently replied.  
“该死，”她简洁地答道。

### Chapter 3

Μάταιόν εστι παρά θεών αιτείσθαι ά τις εαυτώ χορηγήσαι ικανός εστι (It is futile to pray to the gods for that which one has the power to obtain by himself) – Epicurus  
向神明祈求自身有能力获得之物，实乃徒劳无功（It is futile to pray to the gods for that which one has the power to obtain by himself）——伊壁鸠鲁

"Erm, sorry. What was that?" Asked the Third Child from the other end of the phone call.  
“呃，抱歉。刚才说什么？”电话那头传来第三适格者的声音。

Asuka's face set into a scowl at the familiar word, the contempt she regularly felt for her fellow pilot's meek nature once again rising to replace the initial panic she had felt at unexpectedly hearing his voice. _Stop apologizing to me all the time! You never mean it!_ Memories came, unbidden, of Shinji insincerely acting contrite in all manner of situations, but she focused her attention on the task at hand. _Whatever. I can deal with him later._  
听到这个熟悉的词，明日香的脸色沉了下来，对这位同僚飞行员一贯的懦弱本性所感到的鄙视再次涌上心头，取代了起初听到他声音时的惊慌。别再老是跟我道歉了！你从来都不是真心的！记忆不由自主地涌现，回想起真嗣在各种场合下虚伪地表现出悔意，但她将注意力集中在眼前的事情上。无所谓。我稍后再对付他。

"Get Misato on the phone. This is important."  
“让美里接电话。这事很重要。”

"S-sorry, but–she's busy? Maybe you could call back later?" Asuka suppressed a snarl, instead balling her free hand into a fist and rhythmically pounding on her bed which she was situated on.  
"对不起，但是——她现在正忙？或许你可以晚点再打来？" 明日香压下咆哮的冲动，转而用空着的那只手握成拳，有节奏地捶打着她所在的床铺。

"Listen. Whatever it is she's doing right now is not nearly as important as what I have to say to her. So go find her, knock the beer out of her hand, and give her the phone. Understand?" She intoned as calmly as she could–which is to say, she half-growled it out from behind clenched teeth.  
"听着。无论她现在在做什么，都没有我要对她说的话重要。所以去找她，把她的啤酒打掉，然后把电话给她。明白了吗？" 她尽可能平静地念道——也就是说，她几乎是咬牙切齿地低吼出来的。

"Umm," Shinji hesitated, taking a few seconds to consider her instructions. "Ok. Just a minute, sorry," he said, and she heard the muffled sound of him walking, barely eclipsing the sound of her blood pressure rising. After a few steps, she began hearing a faint conversation, as if he had covered the receiver to talk to Misato. She couldn't make out much of what they were saying, but she did hear a few words: _rude_, _European_, and _angry_.  
"嗯，" 真嗣犹豫了一下，花了几秒钟考虑她的指示。"好的。稍等一下，抱歉，" 他说道，她听到他走动的声音，几乎掩盖了她血压上升的声音。走了几步后，她开始听到一段模糊的对话，仿佛他捂住了听筒在与美里交谈。她听不清他们在说什么，但她确实听到了几个词：粗鲁、欧洲人，还有愤怒。

_Yeah, I already knew you prefer meek and submissive girls like your doll Ayanami, tell Misato all about how much you hate–_her train of thought was interrupted by the angry, clipped voice of Misato coming through the phone. "This had better be as important as you say it is, whoever you are."  
是啊，我早就知道你喜欢像你的洋娃娃绫波那样的温顺服从的女孩，告诉美里你有多讨厌——她的思绪被电话那头美里愤怒而急促的声音打断了。“你最好像你说的那样重要，不管你是谁。”

Asuka took a half-second to compose herself before replying; as much as she was used to relying on her anger in a fight, this conversation was, as Kaji had insisted, going to be _subtle_, not a sparring match. "Captain Katsuragi, it's Pilot Soryu. I wanted to–" Again she was interrupted by Misato.  
明日香花了半秒钟整理自己的情绪，然后回答；尽管她习惯于在战斗中依赖愤怒，但这次对话，正如加持所坚持的那样，将会是微妙的，而不是一场较量。“葛城上尉，我是驾驶员惣流。我想——”她再次被美里打断。

"Asuka! It's great to hear from you!" The anger had vanished from her voice, replaced by what Asuka thought to be genuine surprise. "Did you watch Shin-chan's fight against the Angel? Oh, of course you did, what am I saying. Calling to congratulate him?" Here her voice picked up a sly edge. "You're going to have to congratulate him pretty hard, he was the nice boy you talked to earlier and whatever you said to him has got him moping now. Were you being mean to him? That's no way to get close to your fellow pilot, Asuka."  
“明日香！很高兴听到你的声音！”她声音中的愤怒消失了，取而代之的是明日香认为的真诚惊讶。“你看了真嗣对抗使徒的战斗吗？哦，当然看了，我在说什么呢。打电话来祝贺他吗？”这时她的声音带上了一丝狡黠。“你得好好祝贺他，他就是你之前聊过的那个好孩子，而你对他说的那些话让他现在闷闷不乐。你对他刻薄了吗？那样可没法接近你的同伴驾驶员，明日香。”

_First Kaji and now the sot, is that all these adults think about? We're not even on the same continent and they're all convinced I'm some schoolgirl who's lovesick over the Invincible Shinji just because he managed not to die against one Angel! An Angel I could have killed in my sleep!_ "Captain–"  
先是加持，现在又是这个酒鬼，难道这些成年人就只想着这些吗？我们甚至不在同一个大陆，他们却都认定我是某个对‘无敌的真嗣’相思成疾的女学生，只因为他没有在对付一个使徒时丧命！一个我闭着眼睛都能干掉的使徒！“舰长——”

"Nope, none of that!" Misato once again interrupted cheerily. "No formalities between us. Not when we're off the clock, at least." Asuka could hear the implied alcohol fueled _off the clock_ times, no doubt filled with teasing and innuendo, and was already very much over this conversation.  
“不不，别来这套！”美里再次愉快地打断道，“我们之间不需要这些正式称呼。至少在下班后不用。”明日香能听出那隐含的下班后酒精助兴时光，无疑充满了调侃和暗示，她已经对这场对话感到非常厌烦了。

"Misato, this is _important_," she insisted. She heard the older woman sigh quietly.  
“美里，这很重要，”她坚持道。她听到年长的女人轻轻叹了口气。

"Ok then, Asuka, what do you have for me?"  
"那么，明日香，你有什么要告诉我的？"

"Well, I did watch Unit 01's sortie," she started.  
"嗯，我确实观察了零一号机的出击，"她开始说道。"

"And?" Misato asked, her voice leading.  
"然后呢？"美里问道，语气带着引导。"

"_And_, I know you must have had some thoughts about how it went," Asuka replied. _Agh, this is so frustrating!_  
"而且，我知道你一定对事情的经过有些想法，"明日香回答道。啊，真是太令人沮丧了！

"You mean like how well Shin-chan did? Ooh, did you hear what his synch rate was? I was sure he wouldn't even be able to activate Unit 01, but he was good to go almost as soon as he got into the entry plug!"  
"你是说真嗣做得怎么样吗？哦，你听到他的同步率了吗？我原本以为他连 01 号机都启动不了，结果他几乎一进入插入栓就能行动了！"

_What good did your precious Shin-chan's synch rate do for him when he fell face first after taking one step? He_ lost _to that Angel! I know I'm not the only one who can see that!_ "Misato," she said, forcing her voice to remain even with great effort, "I don't care what the Third Child's synch rate was," _that Idiot and his infuriating luck in synching with the test type doesn't matter right now,_ "that fight was a catastrophe. I'm sure you noticed that he was unconscious when the Angel was defeated?"  
你那宝贝真嗣的同步率对他有什么好处？他才迈出一步就脸朝下摔倒了！他输给了那个使徒！我知道我不是唯一一个能看到这一点的人！“美里，”她努力让自己的声音保持平稳，“我不在乎第三适格者的同步率，”那个白痴和他那令人恼火的与试验机型同步的运气现在无关紧要，“那场战斗是一场灾难。我敢肯定你注意到了，使徒被击败时他是昏迷的？”

Another sigh from Misato. "We're still puzzling that one out, actually," she muttered.  
Misato 又叹了口气。“实际上，我们还在琢磨这件事，”她咕哝道。

"Right," Asuka said. "So, you've got one untrained pilot, and one pilot of dubious ability who, for some reason that my clearance won't allow me to find out, is unable to perform her duties. That doesn't sound like a winning strategy for when the next Angel comes."  
“好吧，”明日香说，“所以，你们有一个未经训练的驾驶员，还有一个能力存疑的驾驶员，出于某种我的权限无法了解的原因，她无法履行职责。这听起来不像是对付下一个使徒的制胜策略。”

"No, it doesn't," Misato begrudgingly admitted. "Ayanami's down with injuries–something went wrong with activating Unit 00. And to be honest, _I_ don't even know much more about her than that. Ever since I got here earlier this week they've been pretty tight lipped about her status, which is crazy if you ask me." Asuka had not asked her, but she felt that this line of thinking played into her _subtle_ tactics for this conversation.  
“确实不像，”美里不情愿地承认，“绫波受了伤——零号机启动时出了问题。老实说，我对她的了解也就这么多。自从我这周早些时候到这里以来，他们对她的情况一直守口如瓶，要我说这简直疯了。”明日香并没有问她，但她觉得这种思路符合她在这场对话中微妙的策略。

"I mean, she's a pilot, and I'm the Operations director! If anyone would have a _need-to-know_ on her status, it should be me! Oh, thank you, Shin-chan!" Asuka heard a _kssshh_ from Misato's end of the conversation, followed by the sounds of swallowing. "He's such a thoughtful young man, refreshing my drink for me."  
“我是说，她是个飞行员，而我是运营总监！如果有人需要知道她的状态，那应该是我才对！哦，谢谢你，真嗣君！”明日香听到美里那边传来一阵嘶嘶声，紧接着是吞咽的声音。“他真是个体贴的年轻人，还帮我续杯。”

_Ugh, what a slob, and he's such a kiss-ass_, Asuka thought. _No wonder you moved him into your apartment so quickly. At least he's housebroken enough to clean up after your mess and cater to your drunken whims._ She shuddered at the particularly nasty implications of that last thought. _Great, now I'm thinking of that stuff. You're such a great role model, Misato._  
呃，真是个邋遢鬼，还那么会拍马屁，明日香心想。难怪你这么快就把他搬进你的公寓。至少他还算训练有素，能帮你收拾烂摊子，满足你醉酒后的胡闹。她对最后一个念头中特别糟糕的含义打了个寒颤。天啊，现在我居然在想这些。你真是个好榜样，美里。

"So what happens when the next Angel shows up?" She pressed on, choosing to ignore the unpleasant associations that _Misato's drunken whims_ combined with _Shin-chan_ forced on her subconscious.  
“那下次使徒出现时会怎么样？”她继续追问，选择忽略美里醉酒的胡闹与真嗣在她潜意识中引发的那些不愉快的联想。

"We deploy to engage it; if that means just Shinji in Unit 01 then that's what has to happen. Hopefully we'll have more at our disposal by the time the next one appears." More sounds of drinking what Asuka could only assume to be her former (_former-former?_) guardian's particular brand of beer. "Hell, if I had my way, all you kids would have been right here in Tokyo-III from the start. We know they're coming here; it just makes sense to concentrate our forces."  
“我们会部署去迎战；如果这意味着只有真嗣驾驶初号机，那就只能这样。希望到下次使徒出现时，我们能有更多的资源。”更多的声音传来，明日香只能猜测是她曾经的（前前任？）监护人特别钟爱的那种啤酒。“见鬼，如果我有办法，你们这些孩子一开始就应该在第三新东京市。我们知道它们会来这里；集中我们的力量才是明智之举。”

_Yes! She_ can _take a hint!_ "Well, actually–"  
没错！她能领会暗示！“呃，其实——”

"But it's a moot point," Misato continued, talking over Asuka. "Unit 02 is staying in Berlin until it's completed, and the only deployable Eva we have right now is Unit 01. Having an extra pilot would be nice, but I've been repeatedly assured that the First Child is fit to pilot in an emergency and will be back to regular duty soon anyway. I don't believe a word of it, I don't see how the poor girl could pilot in the state she's in, but apparently it's straight from the Commander's mouth."  
"但这是个无意义的争论，" 美里继续说道，打断了明日香。"二号机将留在柏林直到完成，而我们目前唯一可部署的 Eva 是一号机。多一个驾驶员固然好，但我一再被告知第一适格者紧急情况下能够驾驶，并且很快就会恢复正常任务。我一个字都不信，我不明白那可怜的女孩怎么能在她那种状态下驾驶，但显然这是司令亲口说的。"

_I am not some_ extra pilot. Asuka's face set into a scowl at the off-hand dismissal of her skills. _Steady. Calm down. Be subtle._ "Well," she began, and took a moment to clear her throat and compose her voice–even that one word had had too much vitriol.  
我不是什么额外的驾驶员。明日香的脸色因对方轻视她的技能而变得阴沉。保持冷静。别激动。要巧妙。"好吧，"她开始说，然后停顿了一下清清嗓子，调整自己的声音——即使那一个词也带了太多怨气。

"Well," she began again, "It isn't just about having more pilots for Unit 01, right? I _am_ an expert, after all. I've been training to be a pilot my whole life. I'm sure you can think of some way to utilize my expertise." _Come on, I'm so close!_  
"好吧，"她再次开口，"这不仅仅是关于为一号机增加更多驾驶员的问题，对吧？毕竟我是专家。我一生都在为成为驾驶员而训练。我相信你们一定能找到利用我的专业知识的方法。"来吧，我快成功了！

Misato _hmm_ed over the phone, followed once again by the sounds of her drinking beer. "I can see where you're going with this, Asuka, but what about the Berlin branch? Don't they need you there?"  
美里在电话那头哼了一声，紧接着又传来了她喝啤酒的声音。“我能理解你的想法，明日香，但柏林分部那边怎么办？他们不需要你吗？”

_Gotcha!_ "Not for the last stages of production, no," Asuka replied, a confident smirk spreading on her face. "They've had their claws in me for years and have all the data they need to finish things up. Even the activation was done months ago–it's mostly just tweaks and armor calibrations they're doing now. All the tests they make me sit through here are just to reaffirm my baseline readings."  
抓到你了！“不是为了最后的生产阶段，不，”明日香回答道，脸上自信的微笑逐渐扩散。“他们已经盯着我好几年了，所有需要的数据都有了。就连激活也是几个月前就完成了——现在主要是微调和装甲校准。他们让我在这里做的所有测试，只是为了重新确认我的基准读数。”

Misato once again _hmm_ed and swallowed her beer.  
美里再次哼了一声，咽下了啤酒。

"I mean they'd probably complain about me leaving, but they don't actually need me or anything!" Asuka hurriedly rushed on. "They're just proprietary. And Ops here only cares to keep me around to justify their own existence and increase their funding. Trust me, Misato, I can do way more to help you than I can do to help anyone here in Berlin."  
"我的意思是，他们可能会抱怨我离开，但他们其实并不真正需要我！" 明日香急忙继续说道。"他们只是占有欲强。而这里的作战部只是为了证明自己的存在价值和增加经费才留着我。相信我，美里，我能帮你做的事情远比在这里帮柏林的任何人多得多。"

Another _hmm_ from the phone. "I _am_ still swamped with paperwork from the Angel fight," Misato said slowly. "Having you here to train with the other pilots would mean more paperwork on my end."  
电话那头又是一声轻哼。"我现在还忙着处理天使战斗后的文书工作，"美里缓缓说道，"让你来这里和其他驾驶员一起训练，意味着我这边会有更多的文书工作。"

_Oh, come on! Stop waffling on this, Misato!_ "I wouldn't say _train with_, Misato," she replied haughtily. "I would be training your pilots to fight," _or in the Idiot's case, walk_, "starting with the basics for the Third Child. _Walk_ before you run, and all that."  
哦，得了吧！别在这儿磨叽了，美里！“我可不会说是一起训练，美里，”她傲慢地回答，“我是在训练你的驾驶员们战斗，”或者说，在那个白痴的情况下，是学会走路，“从第三适格者的基础开始。先学会走，再学跑，诸如此类。”

Misato snickered into the phone. "I suppose that would take a bit of a load off my shoulders," she conceded. Her voice turned serious now. "Tell you what: I'll talk to the Sub-Commander and see about transferring you here, sans Unit 02 for the time being, and in the meantime you write up a training plan. I want a day-by-day breakdown of what you intend to put your fellow pilots through. Make it a four-week plan, and we'll see where we go from there. I trust you to take into account that the Third Child has no history of any training like this, and I have no idea what kind of training the First Child has. You'll get it to me by 1700 tomorrow, my time, but the earlier the better. Understood?"  
Misato 轻声笑了起来，对着电话那头说道：“我想这会让我轻松不少。”她承认道。随即，她的语气变得严肃起来：“这样吧：我会和副司令谈谈，看看能否暂时不带二号机把你调过来，同时你得制定一个训练计划。我要你详细列出每天打算如何训练其他驾驶员。计划为期四周，我们再根据情况调整。我相信你会考虑到三号机驾驶员没有任何此类训练经历，而我也不清楚一号机驾驶员接受过怎样的训练。明天下午五点前，按我的时间，把计划交给我，越早越好。明白了吗？”

_Yes! Finally, some good fucking news!_ "You'll have my training plan before you know it," Asuka boasted cheerfully. _I knew she'd be easy to convince!_ "I'll start working on it right now. Can you call me back once you've secured my transfer?"  
太好了！终于有好消息了！“你很快就会收到我的训练计划，”明日香得意洋洋地夸口道。我就知道她很容易说服！“我现在就开始着手准备。你那边搞定我的转职手续后，能再给我回个电话吗？”

"I'll call you back when I get an answer, yes," Misato rectified. "And one more thing, Asuka."  
“等我得到答复就给你回电话，好的。”美里纠正道，“还有一件事，明日香。”

_Oh, what is it now, you lush? We both got what we wanted!_ "Yeah?"  
哦，又怎么了，你这酒鬼？我们都得到了想要的！“是吗？”

"I really am glad you called. Not necessarily about this NERV business, it's just nice to hear from you. You know? We should have kept in touch."  
“我真的很高兴你打电话来。倒不是因为这 NERV 的事，只是听到你的声音感觉很好。你知道吗？我们应该保持联系的。”

_Right. And where was this attitude when I was spiraling my way into laying in a bathtub waiting to die? Take your pity and shove it, Misato. Maybe your precious "Shin-chan" wants it, but I don't_. "Yeah, we should have," she replied, making an effort at, and succeeding in, sounding sincere.  
“对啊。那我陷入绝望，躺在浴缸里等死的时候，这种态度去哪儿了？把你的同情收起来吧，美里。也许你那宝贝的“真嗣君”想要，但我不需要。“是啊，我们应该的，”她回答道，努力并成功地听起来很真诚。

"Well, I need to get back to my paperwork, and you've got a training plan to write. I'll talk to you soon, ok?"  
“好了，我得回去处理我的文书工作了，而你还有训练计划要写。我们回头再聊，好吗？”

"Ok, Misato. Bye," she said, hanging up the phone and dropping it beside her onto the bed. She dropped herself down onto the bed next, letting out an exasperated sigh as she did. "I hate being subtle," she whispered. She'd begun to make a more conscious effort to cover her tracks about this time nonsense, since she knew, being a pilot, that she was under constant surveillance. But little slips like that could mean anything to anyone, and she needed the catharsis of voicing her ire aloud.  
“好的，美里。再见。”她挂断电话，随手将手机扔在床边。随后，她整个人也倒在了床上，发出一声无奈的叹息。“我讨厌拐弯抹角。”她低语道。自从她意识到作为一名驾驶员，自己时刻处于监视之下，便开始更加刻意地掩盖关于时间异常的痕迹。但像这样的小疏忽，对任何人来说都可能意味着任何事，她需要通过大声表达不满来获得宣泄。

Asuka glanced at her clock on the vanity across from her bed, which displayed a bright red 1218 on its digital face. _No time for self-pity. Get ahold of yourself. There's less than 22 hours until Misato's deadline, and you've got shit to do._ She got up from her bed and stretched her arms above her head, working out the kinks in her spine. _First order of business: you need a workout. The pool sounds like the perfect stress reliever right now._  
明日香瞥了一眼对面梳妆台上的时钟，数字显示屏上鲜红的 1218 映入眼帘。没有时间自怨自艾了。振作起来。距离美里的最后期限不到 22 小时，你还有一堆事情要做。她从床上起身，双臂高举过头，舒展着脊背的僵硬。首要任务：你需要锻炼一下。游泳池此刻听起来正是缓解压力的绝佳去处。

As she pulled out a bag to carry her swimwear and a towel in, a thought occurred to her. _The Idiot can't swim, I remember him sitting by the pool doing physics homework instead of wanting to have any fun with me. One more thing to include in my training plan._  
当她拿出一个袋子准备装泳衣和毛巾时，一个念头闪过脑海。那个笨蛋不会游泳，我记得他总是坐在泳池边做物理作业，而不是想和我一起玩。这又是我训练计划中需要考虑的一点。

Equipped with the necessary accoutrements for her upcoming workout in the pool, Asuka stepped out of her quarters and made her way to the gym facilities.  
带着游泳训练所需的装备，明日香走出房间，向健身房设施走去。

Ω

_Aaaaannnndd done_, Asuka thought, penning the last of her training plan on the notepad she had discarded before her conversation with Misato earlier that day. _Nothing too difficult, but not so wimpy that they'll think I'm some sort of slouch! No coasting through the Great Asuka Langley Soryu's Eva Pilot Bootcamp!_ Her face scrunched up in introspection. _Might have to workshop that name._ She checked her clock, which helpfully informed her that it was 1827.  
完成了，明日香心想，在之前与美里谈话那天丢弃的笔记本上写下了她的训练计划的最后一部分。难度不算太高，但也不能太简单，免得他们以为我是个懒散的人！绝不能让伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷的 EVA 驾驶员训练营变成混日子的场所！她皱起眉头沉思着。也许得琢磨一下那个名字。她看了看时钟，上面贴心地显示着现在是 18 点 27 分。

"Plenty of time to spare," she boasted. She flipped back through the notebook to come back to the first page, with her first week of training on it. It consisted mostly of cardio routines, with an emphasis on the pool, but had some bodyweight exercises included as well. Her initial instinct was to jump right into the intense schedule she was used to, but it was tempered by Misato's caution about Shinji being unaccustomed to rigorous exercise, as well as the First's injured state. _If the Commander's pet will even be attending Soryu's Pilot School. No, that's better, but it's still not the right name._  
"时间绰绰有余。" 她自夸道。她翻回笔记本，回到第一页，那是她训练第一周的记录。内容主要是以泳池为重点的有氧运动，也穿插了一些自重训练。她本能地想要直接投入到自己习惯的紧张日程中，但考虑到真嗣对高强度锻炼的不适应以及一之濑的伤势，这种冲动被美里的话缓和了。如果指挥官的宠儿真的会来参加惣流驾驶学校的话。不，那样说更好，但还不是最恰当的称呼。

She began to head out in search of an unattended workstation she could commandeer to type up her plan and send it to Misato. She would have preferred to do it all on her own laptop, but NERV's secure servers being what they were meant that any unauthorized connections to the network triggered all sorts of flags and alarms. She could get away with doing it and not having her laptop destroyed in the name of security, and had done so in the past, but it was a hassle she did not want to go through at the moment.  
她开始四处寻找一台无人看管的工作站，以便征用来打字并发送她的计划给美里。她本想用自己的笔记本电脑完成这一切，但 NERV 的安全服务器机制意味着任何未经授权的网络连接都会触发各种警报和标记。虽然她过去曾侥幸逃脱，免于在安全的名义下被销毁笔记本，但那过程实在麻烦，她此刻并不想再经历一次。

Asuka followed a familiar path to Kaji's office, since the man hardly used it himself. _The Asuka Langley Soryu Center for Children Who Can't Pilot Well. No, that's terrible. Eva Academy? What, and have them call me "Professor Soryu?" Actually, that might not be so bad. I'll hold onto that one._  
明日香沿着一条熟悉的路径走向加持的办公室，毕竟那男人自己几乎不怎么使用。明日香·兰格雷儿童驾驶训练中心？不，这太糟糕了。EVA 学院？什么，难道要他们叫我“兰格雷教授”？其实，这听起来或许还不错。这个主意我先留着。

Her dithering brought her to the door to Kaji's office, which did not immediately open for her. _That's strange, he never locks his office when he's gone. He doesn't even keep anything in there, not even files on his NERV issued computer._ She glanced up and down the hallway, but it was empty of other passersby, likely due to the lateness of the day. With only the general level of Pilot surveillance and NERV security keeping eyes on her, she leaned in close to the door and pressed her ear to it.  
她的犹豫不决让她来到了加持办公室的门前，门并没有立即为她打开。真奇怪，他不在的时候从不锁办公室的门。他甚至连任何东西都不放在那里，连 NERV 配发的电脑里也没有文件。她环顾了一下走廊的上下，但空无一人，可能是因为天色已晚。除了常规的驾驶员监视和 NERV 的安全监控，没有其他目光注视着她，她便靠近门，将耳朵贴了上去。

"Quite serious, yes." She could make out Kaji's muffled voice through the door. There was a long pause while, presumably, the other participant in the conversation spoke. "Yeah, Rits, that's what she said." Another pause, and this time Kaji laughed. "Well, you know she's right about having no reason to be here. If you don't want her help then you can tell her yourself when she gets there."  
“非常认真，是的。”她能透过门听到加持模糊的声音。接下来是一段长时间的停顿，大概是另一位对话者正在说话。“是啊，律子，她就是这么说的。”又是一阵停顿，这次加持笑了。“嗯，你知道她说的没错，她没有理由来这里。如果你不想要她的帮助，那等她到了你自己告诉她吧。”

Asuka clenched her jaw. _That bottle-blonde doesn't want_ my _help? As if she should be passing up the opportunity to work with the Great Asuka Langley Soryu! Fine. I'll be too busy with Asuka's Pilot Program to bother with her anyway. Hm, no, still not the right name._  
明日香紧咬牙关。那个金发碧眼的家伙不需要我的帮助？她竟然会拒绝与伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷合作的机会！好吧。反正我忙着进行明日香的飞行员计划，也没空理她。嗯，不对，还是没找到正确的名字。

"I'd call it spirited, there's no need to be nasty, Rits. Look, one way or another this is likely happening. What's one more set of hands for Project E? If I'm not mistaken, and I think we both know the odds of that, Katsuragi is already looking to transfer the Second Child–" Kaji stopped talking abruptly, as if he had been cut off.  
“我会称之为有活力，没必要刻薄，Rits。看，不管怎样这很可能会发生。对 E 计划来说，多一双手又何妨？如果我没记错，我想我们都清楚这可能性，Katsuragi 已经在考虑转移二号机驾驶员——” Kaji 突然停了下来，仿佛被切断了话头。

"_Everyone_ saw that fight; I'm just surprised she was the first one to suggest this whole thing. Though she's certainly not one to sit around when there's action to be part of. Like I said: spirited. Lively, even."  
大家都目睹了那场战斗；我只是惊讶她竟然是第一个提出这个计划的人。不过，她确实不是那种会在有行动可参与时闲坐一旁的人。就像我说的：充满活力。甚至可以说是生机勃勃。

_You're damn right!_ Asuka agreed, assuming that Kaji was talking about her. _If this is how it went the first time, I should have started Soryu's Seasoning Services back then! Nope, definitely not that one. Makes it sound like some kind of culinary institution._  
你说得没错！明日香附和道，以为加持是在说她。如果第一次就是这样的流程，我早该创办“惣流调味服务”了！不对，绝对不是那个。听起来像是什么烹饪学校似的。

"Well, glad to have you on board, Rits, however reluctantly it may be," Kaji said, and Asuka could hear the smirk on his face as he said it. "I'll leave you to your work, since I know you won't be sleeping any time soon. Yup. Yeah. I know, and so does she. Bye, Rits," he finished.  
“好吧，很高兴你能加入，尽管可能不太情愿，”加持说道，阿斯卡能听出他话中的笑意。“我就不打扰你工作了，我知道你一时半会儿也不会睡。没错，我懂的，她也懂。再见，律子。”他结束了对话。

Asuka quickly pulled away from the door and retreated several steps down the hallway, retracing her approach to the door slowly, trying to time her arrival with Kaji's exit. The door _whoosh_ed open when she was just a few steps away.  
明日香迅速从门前抽身，沿着走廊后退了几步，缓缓回溯自己走向门口的步伐，试图与加持的出门时间同步。当她距离门口仅剩几步之遥时，门呼啸着打开了。

"Ah, Asuka, fancy seeing you around here," Kaji remarked upon seeing her. "Any exciting news?"  
"啊，明日香，没想到在这里遇见你。" 看到她时，加持说道，"有什么新鲜事吗？"

"Well," she said, smiling, "I talked to Misato, and tomorrow she's going to request my transfer. I just need to send her this training plan I wrote up for her."  
"嗯，" 她微笑着说，"我和美里谈过了，明天她会申请我的调职。我只需要把这份为她写的训练计划发给她。"

"That _is_ some exciting news. You see how being subtle can work out for you?" Kaji agreed, returning her smile. "You need to use my computer? Knock yourself out. Oh, and when you're done, swing by the breakroom down the hall, I'll be there getting some coffee. I have some news for you myself."  
"这可是个好消息。你看，有时候委婉一点也能奏效吧？" 加持赞同地回以微笑，"你需要用我的电脑吗？尽管用。哦，还有，用完后顺便去走廊那头的休息室找我，我在那里喝咖啡。我也有消息要告诉你。"

"I'll see you there!" Asuka replied brightly, but the emotion wasn't as forthcoming as it might once have been. _More alone time with Kaji, and once again it does nothing for me. What is wrong with me?_ She stepped into Kaji's office as he made his way down to the breakroom, taking a seat at his desk and opening up the appropriate program to make a professional-looking calendar for her training plan. _No need to half-ass this. Don't give anyone any reason to kick this back._  
“我们那里见！”明日香明快地回应，但那份情感已不如往昔那般自然流露。与加持独处的时光，再次让我感到无所适从。我究竟是怎么了？她跟着加持走进办公室，而他正朝休息室走去，她坐在他的桌前，打开相应的程序，开始制作一份专业感十足的个人训练计划日历。这次可不能敷衍了事。不给任何人退回的借口。

As she designed her calendar and began the mindless task of transposing her writing onto it she began to mull over more of her circumstances that she had been decidedly _not_ thinking about these past few days. _Ok, issue one: I was dead, and now I'm not. Weird, but on its own doesn't mean much. People have been declared dead and come back to life before. Conclusion: this is sort of reasonable._  
当她设计日历并开始将文字无意识地转录到上面时，她开始思考更多这些天来她一直刻意不去想的情况。好吧，问题一：我曾死去，现在又活了。奇怪，但这本身并不意味着什么。人们被宣告死亡后又复活的情况以前也有过。结论：这在某种程度上是合理的。

_Issue two: I have traveled through time and space from the end of December 2015 in Tokyo-III to 9 July 2015 in Berlin. Evidence in favor: I'm not dead. None of the injuries I remember sustaining are present on my body. This facility is, as far as I can tell, identical to NERV-Berlin. The staff here are, as far as I can tell, the same staff that were at NERV-Berlin. All of the clocks and calendars here, including the one I am making right now, show that it is currently July 2015, not December 2015 or January 2016. I have what I assume to be memories of the intervening months but cannot recall how I came to be in Berlin in July 2015. Other details remain the same: Misato's phone number, the Third Child being a spineless, incompetent idiot, the minutia of my life seems to be identical.  
问题二：我从 2015 年 12 月东京-3 穿越时空来到了 2015 年 7 月柏林。支持的证据：我没有死。我记得的所有受伤痕迹现在都不在我的身体上。就我所见，这个设施与 NERV-柏林完全相同。这里的员工，就我所见，与 NERV-柏林的员工相同。这里所有的时钟和日历，包括我现在正在制作的那个，都显示现在是 2015 年 7 月，而不是 2015 年 12 月或 2016 年 1 月。我有一些我假设是那几个月的记忆，但记不清我是如何在 2015 年 7 月来到柏林的。其他细节保持不变：美里电话号码、第三适格者依然是个无能的蠢货，我的生活琐事似乎完全相同。_

_Evidence against: it seems unlikely that the first sortie against an Angel could have gone so poorly and not prompted some drastic actions, but this is not definite proof of anything. It is also impossible to travel through time, as far as I know. Conclusion: none. This is crazy. Or I'm crazy. Or I'm dead, which contradicts earlier assumptions. So, inconclusive.  
反对证据：首次出击对抗使徒竟如此失利，按理说应会引发某些激烈反应，但这并非确凿无疑。据我所知，穿越时空亦是不可能之事。结论：无。这太疯狂了。或者我疯了。又或许我已死去，这与先前假设相悖。因此，无法得出定论。_

She sighed as she finished typing up her plan. _Issue three: I still need a name for this!_ She saved the document as _Soryu_Pilot_Training_Program_, which seemed professional enough for a file name, and attached it to an email she had ready to send to Misato. She tapped a finger against Kaji's desk as she thought of what to say.  
她叹了口气，完成了计划的打字工作。问题三：我还需要给这个起个名字！她将文档保存为 Soryu_Pilot_Training_Program，这个名字对于文件名来说似乎足够专业，并将其附加到一封准备发给美里小姐的电子邮件中。她一边思考着要说什么，一边用手指轻敲着加持的桌子。

_Captain Katsuragi, 葛城上尉，_

_I have attached my proposed pilot training program, which I am informally calling Soryu's Basic Piloting Course (name subject to change). The program is focused on training the Third Child, as I am unsure on the status of the First Child. I believe her participation in any training I conduct will likely be at the Commander's discretion.  
我已附上我拟定的飞行员培训计划，暂且称之为“Soryu 基础驾驶课程”（名称可能更改）。该计划旨在培训第三适格者，因为我对第一适格者的状况尚不确定。我认为她是否参与我所主持的任何训练，将很大程度上取决于司令的裁量。_

_Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷_

_Second Child, Pilot, Evangelion Unit 02  
第二适格者，驾驶员，EVA 二号机_

_NERV-Berlin 柏林 NERV_

Asuka sent her email, still unsure on the name she had chosen but overall happy with the tone of the message. _Now on to the next task_, she thought, closing out of her active programs and getting up from Kaji's chair.  
明日香发送了她的电子邮件，尽管对所选的名字仍有些犹豫，但总体上对信息的语气感到满意。她想着，接下来该处理下一个任务了，关闭了活跃的程序，从加持的椅子上站起身来。

Ω

Asuka arrived the breakroom Kaji had wanted to meet her in to find her guardian standing entirely too close to one of Doctor Vogel's subordinates in Project E, the young woman trying and failing to hide a blush with some files she was holding in her hands in front of her face while Kaji leaned against a vending machine and sipped from a can of iced coffee.  
明日香到达了加持想要与她会面的休息室，发现她的监护人站得离 Project E 的沃格尔博士的一位下属太近了，那位年轻女子试图用手中拿着的文件挡住脸来掩饰脸红，而加持则靠在自动售货机上，啜饮着一罐冰咖啡。

She narrowed her eyes at the woman and said, "You wanted to talk to me, Kaji?" She didn't look away from the woman as she quickly made her retreat from the room, muttering apologies and excuses as she went.  
她眯起眼睛盯着那女人，问道：“你想跟我谈谈，加治？”她一边迅速退出房间，一边喃喃自语着道歉和借口，目光始终未从那女人身上移开。

"Sure did, kiddo," he said, his face set in his usual mask of a light-hearted smirk. He gestured to a table and some chairs next to him. "Let's have a seat. You want anything?" He cocked his head to the vending machine behind him, only sitting down when Asuka shook her head _no_ in reply. Asuka joined him at the table.  
"确实如此，孩子，" 他说道，脸上挂着他一贯轻松愉快的微笑。他指向旁边的一张桌子和几把椅子。"我们坐下吧。你想喝点什么吗？" 他歪着头指向身后的自动售货机，直到明日香摇头表示不需要后才坐下。明日香也跟着他坐到了桌旁。

"So, some news from me," he started. "I've been making the rounds–"  
"那么，我有些消息要告诉你，" 他开口道。"我一直在四处打听——"

"Is _that_ what you call it?" Asuka cut in bitterly. _Disgusting adults. They're all perverts._  
“这就是你所谓的称呼吗？”明日香尖锐地插话，语气中带着苦涩。“这些恶心的成年人，全都是变态。”

Kaji chuckled. "Yes, actually. That's part of the whole subtlety thing, though perhaps I could have been a bit more subtle with the lieutenant a few moments ago." Asuka scoffed at his reply, but he continued on. "Regardless, the rounds have been made, and will continue to be made, mind you, and the prospects look good.  
"加持轻笑一声。“确实如此。不过，这正是所谓的微妙之处，或许我刚才对中尉的暗示可以再含蓄一些。”明日香对他的回答嗤之以鼻，但他继续说道：“无论如何，这些试探已经开始了，并且会继续下去，请注意，前景看起来不错。”

"It turns out Doctor Vogel's staff agree that they've collected as much data as is useful from you in order to finish Unit 02's production, even if the man himself seems to think otherwise. And, more importantly, the esteemed Doctor Akagi, Head of Project E, has agreed that your arrival in advance of Unit 02 to Japan would facilitate their readiness to receive the production model." Kaji winked at the girl across from him at the table.  
"事实证明，沃格尔博士的团队认为他们已经从你这里收集了足够多的有用数据，以完成二号机的生产，即便博士本人似乎不这么认为。更重要的是，备受尊敬的赤木博士，E 计划负责人，也同意你提前抵达日本将有助于他们准备好接收生产型二号机。" 坐在桌子对面的卡吉向女孩眨了眨眼。

"Combined with your convincing of Katsuragi, I'd say this is in the bag for you."  
"再加上你说服了葛城，我想这事对你来说已经是板上钉钉了。"

Asuka smiled. "That's great, Kaji!"  
明日香笑了。"太好了，卡吉！"

He nodded and spoke again. "Isn't there someone else you'd want to talk to about this?"  
他点点头，再次开口：“关于这件事，你不想找其他人谈谈吗？”

Asuka raised an eyebrow at him. "Who? The director? I imagine he'll be getting a phone call or something in the next day or so, there's no need for me to meet with him. _Subtlety_, right?"  
明日香对他挑了挑眉。“谁？导演吗？我想他接下来一两天会接到电话什么的，没必要我去见他。要低调，对吧？”

"No," Kaji said, shaking his head. "I meant your parents, Asuka."  
“不，”加持摇了摇头说，“我是说你的父母，明日香。”

She sneered at his statement. _That woman is not my mother. And I can't even remember the last time Papa spoke to me. I don't need them, I don't want them, and I don't care about them._ "Papa knows how to contact me if he wants to talk to me," she said cynically.  
她对他的话嗤之以鼻。那个女人不是我母亲。我甚至记不清上次爸爸和我说话是什么时候了。我不需要他们，我不想要他们，我也不在乎他们。“如果爸爸想和我说话，他知道怎么联系我。”她冷冷地说道。

Kaji sighed, planting his elbows on the table and resting his chin in his hands. "I know you've had your differences with your father, but family is important, Asuka. You shouldn't just cut them off."  
加持叹了口气，将胳膊肘撑在桌上，双手托着下巴。“我知道你和你父亲有过节，但家庭很重要，明日香。你不应该就这样断绝关系。”

"Then maybe Papa shouldn't have cut me off first, Kaji. I don't think he's even called me in the past year. I don't have anything I want to say to him." Asuka set her jaw, the old indignation of being neglected by her father and tip-toed around by his new wife coming back to her.  
“那也许是因为爸爸先切断了与我的联系，加持。我觉得过去一年里他甚至都没给我打过电话。我没什么想对他说的。”明日香紧咬着牙，父亲对她的忽视以及新妻子对她的小心翼翼所引发的旧日愤懑再次涌上心头。

"Ok Asuka," Kaji said, sighing again. "Just promise me that if he does call or try to contact you, you'll give him a chance to talk?" His face and tone were pleading, which she could not recall seeing or hearing from him before.  
"好吧，明日香，"加持叹了口气，再次说道，"答应我，如果他真的打电话或试图联系你，你会给他一个说话的机会吗？"他的表情和语气中流露出恳求，这是她记忆中未曾见过的。

"Fine," she muttered. "好吧，"她嘟囔道。

"All right. I'll take what I can get," Kaji said, taking his chin out of his hands and standing up from the table. "It's getting kind of late. What do you say you and I go off-base somewhere and grab some dinner? My treat," he added. This was accompanied by a grin and a wink at Asuka.  
"好吧。我接受我能得到的，"加持说着，从双手托腮的姿势中抬起头，从桌边站起身来。"天色也不早了。你说我们俩离营去哪儿吃个晚饭怎么样？我请客，"他补充道。说着还对明日香咧嘴一笑，眨了眨眼。

_He's just trying to make amends after pissing me off. What was he thinking? Fooling around with that floozy, then telling me I need to talk to Papa? As if._ She frowned slightly as Kaji cocked his head towards the doorway, clearly signaling her to get up and accompany him to dinner. _And once again I get to have alone time Kaji, and I don't even seem to care._  
他只是想在我生气后弥补一下。他到底在想什么？和那个轻浮的女人鬼混，然后告诉我需要和爸爸谈谈？好像吧。她微微皱眉，看着加持歪头示意门口，显然是在叫她起身一起去吃饭。又一次，我和加持独处，而我似乎并不在意。

Standing up, she smiled at Kaji and grabbed one of his arms with both of hers, pressing herself tightly to him. _I suppose I should keep up appearances._ "That sounds great, Kaji. Somewhere expensive. This is a celebratory dinner, after all."  
站起身来，她对加持展颜一笑，双手紧握住他的一只手臂，将自己紧紧贴向他。我想我该维持表面功夫。“听起来不错，加持。去个高档的地方吧。毕竟这是庆祝晚宴。”

"Of course, Asuka. Only the best for the best pilot, right?"  
“当然，明日香。只为最优秀的飞行员准备最好的，对吧？”

_If only I could have had something like this a few weeks ago_.  
要是几周前能有这样的东西就好了。

### Chapter 4

Ού ταυτόν είδος φαίνεται των πραγμάτων πρόσωθεν όντων εγγύθεν θ' ορωμένων (Things do not look the same when viewed from far or near) — Euripides  
事物远观与近看，其貌往往不同——欧里庇得斯

"_I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you!" Asuka growled, one hand covering the cavity in her skull where her ruined eye once was, the other reaching upwards towards the enemy that was circling around her pinned Eva, drawing lazy rings in the sky like vultures circling around their dying prey._  
“我要杀了你！我要杀了你！我要杀了你！我要杀了你！”明日香咆哮着，一只手捂着她头骨上被毁眼睛曾经所在的黑洞，另一只手向上伸向那个在她被钉住的 Eva 周围懒洋洋地画圈的敌人，就像秃鹫围绕着垂死的猎物盘旋。

_She felt what she had once considered to be impossible: Unit 02 activating and responding to her movements despite having run its batteries dry, the Eva seemingly answering to her rage and rising to match it. The massive beast's own arm rose towards the sky, grasping for its foes.  
她感受到了曾经认为不可能的事情：02 号机尽管电池耗尽，却依然响应着她的动作，Eva 似乎回应着她的愤怒，随之升起与之相抗。这头巨兽的手臂也向天空举起，试图抓住它的敌人。_

_It was for naught, as a lance came piercing down from the sky, slicing Unit 02's arm cleanly down the middle. The injury was reflected on the girl inside, but she did not have any time to react to it before even more lances pierced through her Eva, goring it through the abdomen and legs and holding it fast to the ground. They were followed by her foes descending on the downed fighter.  
这一切都是徒劳，因为一柄长矛从天而降，将 02 号机的手臂从中间干净利落地劈开。伤害也反映在内部的女孩身上，但她还来不及对此做出反应，更多的长矛就刺穿了她的 Eva，贯穿腹部和腿部，将它牢牢钉在地上。随后，她的敌人降落在倒下的战士身上。_

_As they ripped into Unit 02 with their teeth and hands, tearing off chunks of flesh and armor alike, Asuka curled into herself, grabbing onto her stomach and thrashing around her entry plug in pain as the wounds appeared on her beneath her plug suit. She endured the assault for a few moments, then it seemed to abruptly stop—her relief accompanied by a familiar sound, one she even recognized as she was dying inside her entry plug. Unit 01 was bellowing its unmistakable roar, and her killers were abandoning their defeated enemy to face the new threat.  
当他们用牙齿和双手撕裂 02 号机，扯下血肉与装甲时，明日香蜷缩成一团，紧紧抓住自己的腹部，在插入栓内痛苦翻滚，仿佛伤口正透过紧身衣显现。她忍受了片刻的攻击，随后这一切突然停止——伴随着熟悉的声响，她感到一丝宽慰，即便自己正濒临死亡。01 号机发出了那不容错辨的咆哮，而她的袭击者们则放弃了已败的敌人，转而面对新的威胁。_

"_So is this what it takes?" Asuka slurred groggily as her vision blurred even further and her world turned dark._  
“所以，这就是代价吗？”明日香含糊不清地咕哝着，视线愈发模糊，世界陷入黑暗。

Asuka awoke suddenly, breathing quickly, her eyes wide and darting to check her surroundings. She was alone in the passenger cabin of a NERV jet. The cabin itself consisted of a few rows of seats, two on each side, with an aisle down the middle leading from the crew areas up front down to the last row of seats. She gathered up the papers that were strewn across the tray table in front of her and placed them back into the folder she had taken them from on the seat beside her.  
明日香突然惊醒，急促地呼吸着，双眼大睁，迅速扫视四周。她独自一人坐在 NERV 喷气机的乘客舱内。舱内设有几排座位，每侧各有两排，中间留有一条通道，从前方的机组区域一直延伸至最后一排座位。她将散落在面前托盘桌上的文件收拢，放回旁边座位上的文件夹中。

_I must've dozed off while going over these boring test results,_ Asuka thought. Her breathing had evened out, and she was reassured that she had not had any witnesses to what was clearly a nightmare in the form of memories of her death. _Stupid girl. You've spent a week keeping yourself busy, how did you not expect this to happen eventually?_  
阿斯克一定是在翻阅这些无聊的测试结果时打了个盹，她想。她的呼吸已经平稳，这让她确信没有人目睹到那明显是噩梦般的死亡记忆。愚蠢的女孩。你已经忙了一周，怎么就没料到这迟早会发生呢？

She sighed and rubbed her eyes. _I hate this_. Unbuckling her seatbelt and standing up, she made her way towards the restroom at the front of the cabin. Once inside the cramped space, she ran the sink and splashed some water on her face. Glaring at herself in the mirror, she looked closely at her left eye. _It's like it didn't even happen. Like it didn't even matter._  
她叹了口气，揉了揉眼睛。我讨厌这样。解开安全带，站起身来，她向机舱前部的洗手间走去。一进到狭小的空间，她打开水龙头，往脸上泼了些水。对着镜子瞪着自己，她仔细观察左眼。仿佛那件事从未发生过。仿佛那根本无关紧要。

Asuka gripped the edge of the small counter and closed her eyes, bowing her head down over the sink. _I have the fight of my life against a pack of monsters—beat, them, even! And they_ get back up _and take me down right when I run out of power. And then the Invincible Shinji shows up, just in time to watch me die._ She grimaced. _He'll do anything to save his precious doll, but when I'm fighting for my life he won't even lift a finger. And what did he even do once I was dead, and he could show off to everyone?! He must have screwed something up; otherwise, why else would I be here?_  
明日香紧握着小柜台的边缘，闭上眼睛，将头深深埋在洗手池上。我拼尽全力与一群怪物搏斗——甚至打败了它们！可它们又爬起来，在我耗尽力量时将我击倒。然后，无敌的真嗣及时出现，目睹我死去。她皱起眉头。他会不惜一切拯救他珍贵的玩偶，但当我为生命而战时，他却连手指都不愿动一下。我死后，他又能向所有人炫耀些什么呢？他肯定搞砸了什么；否则，我为何会在这里？

"Typical," she muttered. She let go of the counter and turned to leave, returning to her seat in the cabin. _I died trying to save the world. Should I take some solace in that it's supposedly still turning?_ Once again she remembered flashes of faces, some familiar and some less so, accompanied by an overall pervading _red_ness. _Something must have happened after I died. Whether or not my death mattered to it is a moot point._  
“典型，”她低声抱怨。她松开柜台，转身离开，回到船舱的座位上。我为拯救世界而死。这世界据说仍在运转，我是否该从中找到些许安慰？她再次回想起一些面孔，有些熟悉，有些则不然，伴随着一片弥漫的红色。我死后一定发生了什么。我的死是否对此有意义，已无从考证。

Asuka reached back over to grab one of her folders, rifling through the papers inside of it. _I'm alive now—I'm here now. I have to move forward. The way out is through, right?_  
明日香伸手再次拿起一个文件夹，翻阅里面的文件。我现在还活着——我现在在这里。我必须向前走。出路在于前行，对吧？

As she settled into reviewing more test results, the door to the crew area opened and one of the team approached Asuka.  
当她开始审阅更多的测试结果时，乘员区的门打开了，团队中的一员走向明日香。

"Pilot Soryu, we'll be landing shortly. When you disembark, there'll be a NERV representative waiting for you to take you to the Geofront. You're to accompany them immediately."  
“Soryu 驾驶员，我们即将着陆。下机后，会有 NERV 的代表在等你，带你前往 Geofront。你必须立即随他们走。”

"Right, sure," Asuka said dismissively, barely sparing the young man a glance as he turned back towards the crew area.  
“好的，知道了，”明日香不以为意地说道，几乎没有看那个年轻人一眼，他转身回到了乘员区。

Ω

"Asuka, my goodness! Look at you—you've grown!"  
"明日香，天哪！看看你——你长大了！"

Asuka narrowed her eyes at the purpled-haired woman in the tight black dress and red jacket who was waving frantically in her direction. _Of course it would be her._  
明日香眯起眼睛看着那位身穿紧身黑裙、红色夹克、紫色头发的女人，她正朝她疯狂挥手。果然是她。

"Yeah, I suppose that happens," Asuka said apprehensively as she approached Misato.  
"是啊，我想这是难免的，"明日香带着几分不安地走向美里。

"Ooh, are we a little grumpy from the long flight?" Misato teased, smiling smugly, and covering one side of her mouth with a hand to conspiratorially whisper to Asuka as she wrapped her other arm around the girl's shoulders. "That's ok, I made sure you weren't scheduled to begin any tests or training today, so you can take the rest of the day to unwind. Heh, maybe I'll join you myself," she added the last part a little louder, quirking her eyebrows at Asuka.  
"哦，是不是长途飞行让我们有点小脾气了？" 美里打趣道，得意地笑着，用手遮住嘴的一侧，凑近明日香耳边低语，同时用另一只手臂环住她的肩膀。"没关系，我特意安排你今天不用开始任何测试或训练，你可以放松一整天。嘿，也许我自己也会加入你呢，"她最后一句稍微提高音量，对着明日香挑了挑眉。

"But my training plan!" Asuka yelled, shrugging the older woman's arm from her shoulder, and turning to face her head on with her fists planted on her hips. "It starts today!"  
"但我的训练计划！" 明日香喊道，甩开年长女子的手臂，转身正面面对她，双手叉腰。"今天就开始了！"

"Yeah, uh, about that," Misato said, putting a hand on Asuka's back and gently pushing her towards the building's exit. "You realize Shinji _goes to school_, right? Even if we moved the times around to accommodate that, you still had four hours a day of training—combined with his other responsibilities, he wouldn't have any time to himself. The kid needs a break sometimes, so I revised your 'Pilot Seminar' schedule a little bit."  
“呃，关于那个，”美里说着，将手搭在明日香的背上，轻轻推着她向建筑物的出口走去。“你知道真嗣要上学吧？就算我们调整时间来适应这一点，你每天仍有四个小时的训练——再加上他的其他责任，他根本就没有自己的时间。那孩子有时也需要休息，所以我稍微调整了一下你的‘驾驶员研讨会’日程。”

"That's _not_ what it's called," Asuka said bitterly as the pair of them made their way towards the parking facilities. "And cleaning up after you hardly counts as one of his responsibilities," she added drolly.  
"那不是它的名字，"明日香苦涩地说道，两人正朝着停车场走去。"而且清理你的烂摊子根本不算他的职责之一，"她挖苦地补充道。

"Well, whatever it's called, you've got a revised version waiting for you in your new home, which is already set up for you in the Geofront. And I'll have you know we divided up the apartment chores fair and square," she included, miffed. "It isn't my fault he's unlucky."  
"好吧，不管它叫什么，你的新家已经为你准备好了，就在 Geofront。而且我得告诉你，我们公平地分配了公寓的家务，"她有些不悦地补充道，"他运气不好可不是我的错。"

Misato pointed out her car and gestured to it, indicating to Asuka to get in. "Your stuff is making its way to the Geofront as we speak, too, so by the time we get there and I give you a little tour of the facilities, you should be all set." Misato entered her car, Asuka sullenly getting into the passenger seat beside her.  
美里指着自己的车，示意明日香上车。"你的东西正在运往 Geofront，所以等我们到达那里，我带你参观一下设施后，你应该就一切就绪了。"美里进入车内，明日香闷闷不乐地坐在她旁边的乘客座位上。

_I just got here and already things are going to shit._ The ride to the Geofront was filled with Misato's attempts at small talk and Asuka rebuffing said attempts, but nothing the younger woman did seemed to completely dispel her superior officer's cheer.  
我刚到这里，事情就已经开始乱套了。前往 Geofront 的路上，Misato 试图进行轻松的闲聊，而 Asuka 则一一回绝，但这位年轻女性所做的一切似乎都无法完全驱散她上级那股子乐观劲儿。

Ω

"—which brings us here, to your quarters." Misato gestured extravagantly to the door in front of her with a nameplate reading _Soryu, A._  
“——于是我们就到了这里，你的宿舍。”Misato 夸张地指向她面前的那扇门，门牌上写着“Soryu, A.”

"Great," Asuka sighed, "that only took all day."  
“太好了，”Asuka 叹了口气，“这可花了一整天。”

"Hey, cut me some slack! I'm pretty new around here myself, you know," Misato explained. Her tour for Asuka had turned into a wandering through the Geofront as the captain seemingly guessed at random which directions to take to show Asuka the basic facilities. In the end, the pair had managed to locate all of the essential areas a pilot would need to know how to find—along with plenty of back stairways and mostly unused maintenance corridors that appeared to haphazardly tunnel throughout the Geofront. And plenty more complaints and correct directions that Asuka kept to herself.  
“嘿，别对我太苛刻！我自己对这里也不太熟悉，你知道的。”美里解释道。她原本为明日香安排的参观变成了在 Geofront 的漫游，仿佛队长随意猜测着方向，带明日香参观基本设施。最终，两人设法找到了飞行员需要知道的所有重要区域——以及许多几乎无人使用的后楼梯和维护走廊，这些走廊似乎随意地贯穿整个 Geofront。还有许多明日香默默记在心里的抱怨和正确的方向。

Misato swiped a card on a reader beside the door, which _whoosh_ed open in response. Stepping in, she turned to face Asuka and handed her the card. "Welcome home, Asuka! Here's your new ID card, just turn in your old one when you get the chance. What do you think of the place?" She stepped to the side as Asuka entered behind her and took the card, sweeping her arm out to encompass the living area.  
Misato 在门旁的读卡器上刷了一下卡，门应声而开。她走进去，转身面向 Asuka，递给她一张卡片。"欢迎回家，Asuka！这是你的新 ID 卡，有机会的话把旧的交上来就行。你觉得这里怎么样？"她侧身让 Asuka 进来接过卡片，同时挥手示意整个生活区。

_Well, it's the same as it was last time_, Asuka thought. Her new home consisted of the entryway the pair of women were now standing in, which led into a modest living room. Said living room was filled with boxes stacked indiscriminately throughout the room, blocking access to the doors leading to the rest of the apartment.  
唉，和上次一样，明日香心想。她的新家由入口处组成，两位女士此刻正站在那里，通向一个朴素的客厅。这个客厅里堆满了杂乱无章的箱子，挡住了通往公寓其他房间的门。

"It's fine," Asuka said, walking into the stacks of boxes and peering at their labels. _I never actually unpacked most of these. Maybe I didn't need to bring all of this again._  
"没事的，"明日香说着，走进一摞摞的箱子间，仔细查看它们的标签。我其实大部分都没拆开过。或许我不必把这些全都再搬来。

Misato leaned against the doorframe, grinning as she watched Asuka inspect her things. "I know you like your space, so I made sure to get you one of the nicer little apartments down here. Plus, it's close to the gym. At least I think it is, anyway," she said sheepishly. "Since that's probably where you'll be spending most of your duty days anyway, _Drill Sergeant Soryu_."  
美里靠在门框上，看着明日香检查她的物品，脸上挂着笑容。“我知道你喜欢有自己的空间，所以我特意给你挑了这里比较好的一间小公寓。而且，离健身房很近。至少我是这么认为的，”她有些不好意思地说，“毕竟，你大概会在那里度过大部分的执勤日，索吕中士。”

Asuka's face blanched. "Don't call me that," she snapped. _Professor Soryu sounds way better, anyway._ She began unstacking boxes to get at lower ones, not looking for anything in particular other than a hint for Misato to take about leaving.  
明日香的脸色一白。“别那么叫我。”她厉声道。反正“索依龙教授”听起来好多了。她开始拆开堆叠的箱子，以便拿到下面的那些，并没有特意寻找什么，只是给美里一个暗示，让她知道该离开了。

"Hey, you set up Asuka's Boot Camp; the title comes with the territory," Misato said cheerily, ignoring Asuka's irritated tone.  
“嘿，你安排了明日香的训练营；这个头衔是职责所在。”美里欢快地说道，无视了明日香恼怒的语气。

"That's not what it's called!" Asuka replied shrilly, turning to face Misato and placing her hands on her hips. "I suppose _I'm_ the only person taking this seriously?"  
“那才不是它的名字！”明日香尖声反驳，转身面对美里，双手叉腰。“难道只有我一个人认真对待这件事吗？”

"Nope," Misato chirped, her grin spreading. "You should have seen Shin-chan's face when I told him to report to you tomorrow after school—I wish I'd had a camera! You made quite the impression on him with whatever you said to him last week. And when I told him to be ready to get in the pool with you, he turned the most _adorable_ shade of red."  
“没有，”美里欢快地应道，笑容愈发灿烂。“你真该看看我让他明天放学后向你报到时，真嗣那小子的表情——真希望我当时有台相机！你上周对他说的那些话，给他留下了深刻的印象。而当我告诉他要准备好和你一起下水时，他的脸红得简直可爱极了。”

Asuka fought down a blush of her own, letting her arms fall to her sides and turning quickly back to sort through her boxes again. _That is_ not _what this is about! What is wrong with everyone?!_ "I want to take the rest of the day to get sorted out and go over your revisions to my schedule," she said in clipped tones.  
明日香压下自己的脸红，双臂垂落身侧，迅速转身继续整理她的箱子。这根本不是重点！大家到底怎么了？！“我想用剩下的时间整理一下，再仔细看看你对我的日程安排所做的修改。”她用生硬的语气说道。

"Ok, ok, I get it," Misato said, pushing off from the doorframe and taking one last look at the pilot. "Welcome home, Asuka," she said, quietly, before stepping through the door.  
“好了，好了，我明白了。”美里说着，从门框边推开身子，最后看了一眼那位驾驶员。“欢迎回家，明日香。”她轻声说道，随后踏入门内。

It shut behind her before Asuka had a chance to offer a response, but one was not forthcoming anyway. Instead, she began organizing her boxes of belongings into stacks of _unpack now_, _maybe unpack later_, and _don't bother unpacking you'll never need this_. Once completed, and her living room cleared of obstructions, she peered into her bedroom to confirm the presence of the closet, wardrobe, desk, chair, and bed she remembered should be in there, and noticed a binder sitting on the desk she rightfully recalled as being present.  
门在她有机会回应之前就关上了，但反正也没有回应。相反，她开始将她的物品箱分类整理成现在就拆箱、可能稍后拆箱，以及不必费心拆箱的——这些东西你永远不会需要。完成后，她的客厅清除了障碍物，她朝卧室里瞥了一眼，确认记忆中的衣柜、书桌、椅子和床都在那里，并注意到书桌上放着一个她记得应该存在的文件夹。

_That must be Misato's revised calendar,_ Asuka thought as she walked over to the desk and sat in the chair in front of it. She opened the binder and glanced at its contents.  
那一定是美里修改过的日程表，明日香想着，走向书桌并坐在前面的椅子上。她打开文件夹，扫了一眼里面的内容。

"Oh, _come on_!" She yelled, slamming a fist down onto the desk and her face twisting into a scowl. _An hour a day? What am I supposed to accomplish with just an hour's worth of training that Idiot a day! And she made Sunday a rest day!_  
“哦，拜托！”她喊道，一拳砸在桌子上，脸上露出愤怒的表情。每天一小时？我每天只用那白痴的一小时训练能完成什么！而且她还把星期天定为休息日！

She flipped through more pages of the training plan, her scowl deepening as she read more. It detailed a less-intense version of her plan, which was already a much less-intense version of the plan she would have wanted to follow, but it still broadly measured up with her division of time between physical training and what she preferred to think of as _combat training_: the fun activities like sparring and confidence courses which could be done in person or even inside Evas—simulated or otherwise.  
她翻阅着训练计划的更多页，眉头越皱越深。这份计划详述了一个强度较低的版本，而她原本的计划已经比她理想中的要轻松许多，但即便如此，它大体上还是与她在体能训练和自认为的战斗训练——那些有趣的实战演练和信心课程，既可亲身上阵也能在 Eva 中进行，无论是模拟还是其他形式——之间的时间分配相符。

_At least she didn't cut all the time I had planned for actually training inside the Evas_, Asuka consoled herself as she closed the binder with a sigh. She had the information she needed for tomorrow: she'd be meeting Shinji at NERV's pool at 1700, which, combined with the armfuls of papers she'd skimmed through during her tour that informed her of her reporting schedule for the next few weeks, meant that tomorrow she a day full of being poked and prodded by doctors followed by an evening of teaching the Third Child to swim.  
至少她没有占用我计划中用于实际训练在 Eva 内部的时间，明日香自我安慰着，叹了口气合上了文件夹。她已经掌握了明天所需的信息：她将在 17:00 与真嗣在 NERV 的泳池见面，再加上她在参观过程中匆匆浏览的大量文件，这些文件告知了她接下来几周的报告安排，这意味着明天她将度过一整天被医生们检查，随后晚上还要教第三适格者游泳。

_This is just one more obstacle for the Great Asuka Langley Soryu,_ she thought. She got up from her desk and returned to her living room with its stacks of boxes. _I just have an opportunity to show everyone how good I am—so good that I can get their precious_ Shin-chan _up to snuff with less than half the time I originally wanted!_  
这不过是明日香·兰格雷再添的一个障碍罢了，她想。她从书桌前起身，回到堆满纸箱的客厅。我正好有机会向所有人展示我有多出色——出色到能用不到原计划一半的时间，就让他们的宝贝新真嗣达到标准！

She began working on her _unpack now_ boxes, organizing the clothes and other items into various spaces in her new home. _Once again the Third Child gets coddled, and I have to deal with the mess_.  
她开始整理刚拆开的箱子，将衣物和其他物品分类安置在新家的各个角落。老三又一次被宠溺，而我却得收拾这烂摊子。

Ω

Asuka sat on a hard bed in an examination room, wearing a paper gown and impatiently drumming her fingers against the bed's surface. Her day had started with a brief introduction to one of Doctor Akagi's assistants, having met the doctor herself on her superfluous tour the previous day. Said assistant, a mousy woman who Asuka recognized but had never learned her name—a feat she was repeating as she already didn't recall it again, had politely asked the pilot to get changed and wait in the exam room for someone to come by and begin some routine procedures.  
明日香坐在检查室里一张硬邦邦的床上，身上裹着纸质病号服，不耐烦地用手指敲打着床面。她的这一天始于与赤木博士助手的一次简短介绍，昨天她已经见过博士本人，并进行了一次多余的参观。那位助手，一个明日香认得但从未记住名字的女人——她再次重复了这一疏忽，因为她已经不记得了，礼貌地请飞行员换好衣服，在检查室里等待有人来开始一些常规程序。

That, predictably, had been over an hour ago. _At this rate the next Angel will show up before this doctor does. When is it supposed to show its face, anyway? Uhg! I should I have paid attention to the ones from before I got to Japan!_ Her impatient scowl deepened at her lack of preparedness, but it was then that the exam room door suddenly opened, and a tired-looking Doctor Akagi walked in.  
不出所料，那已经是超过一个小时前的事了。照这样下去，下一个使徒出现之前这位医生都不会来。话说回来，它到底什么时候会露面？呃！我应该多关注一下来日本之前的那些使徒的！她因自己的准备不足而皱起了不耐烦的眉头，但就在这时，检查室的门突然打开，一脸疲惫的赤木博士走了进来。

She was carrying a clipboard and an unlit cigarette in one hand, a coffee cup in the other, and did not look up from her clipboard as she took a seat in the chair next to Asuka. The pilot, meanwhile, raised a skeptical eyebrow at the doctor. It went unnoticed.  
她一手拿着夹板和未点燃的香烟，另一手端着咖啡杯，坐到明日香旁边的椅子上时，眼睛始终没离开过夹板。而那位驾驶员则对医生挑起了一边眉毛，表示怀疑，但这一表情并未被察觉。

"I was expecting that assistant of yours, or something," Asuka said as Akagi set down her coffee cup to rummage through a drawer in a small table next to her, pulling out equipment hermetically sealed in bags.  
“我以为你会带你的助手来，或者别的什么，”明日香说道，与此同时，赤城放下咖啡杯，在小桌子的抽屉里翻找起来，拿出一些密封在袋子里的设备。

"Who? You mean Lt. Ibuki? She's not qualified for any of this—she just helps me screen some of my more extraneous responsibilities." Asuka blanched at being referred to as an _extraneous responsibility_ but stopped short of voicing her displeasure. She was acutely aware of the doctor's dislike for her–or at least her assumed dislike for her, based on what she had overheard from Kaji's conversation–and did not want to jeopardize her chances of working with Unit 02.  
“谁？你是说伊吹副官吗？她可没资格处理这些——她只是帮我筛选一些无关紧要的职责罢了。”听到自己被称作无关紧要的责任，明日香脸色一白，却忍住了表达不满的冲动。她深知这位医生对她的反感——或者至少是她根据加治的对话推测出的反感——因此不想危及与二号机合作的机会。

"Frankly I'm not qualified either," the doctor continued, finally setting down her clipboard. She looked at the cigarette in her hand as if noticing it for the first time before placing it between her lips and lighting it. "I'd say I don't know why the commander has me doing this, but that'd be a lie." As she spoke, she continued to take frequent drags from her cigarette, at least being courteous enough to blow the smoke away from her patient.  
“坦白说，我也不够格，”医生继续说道，终于放下了手中的夹板。她看着手里的香烟，仿佛是第一次注意到它，随后将其衔在唇间点燃。“我得承认，不知道指挥官为何让我来做这件事，但那肯定是谎话。”她边说边频繁地吸着烟，至少还算礼貌地将烟雾吹向远离病人的方向。

"You do some medical work for one pilot, suddenly you're the go-to pilot medical expert, never mind that I'm not a medical doctor. Give me your arm," she said, holding her cigarette between her lips and wrapping a strap around Asuka's arm to take her blood pressure. _I think this woman needs a nap, not caffeine and nicotine,_ Asuka thought. _Smoking during a medical exam! So unprofessional. It really is all adults that are like this, not just Misato and Kaji. Next she's going to start making lewd jokes._  
"你为一位飞行员做了些医疗工作，突然间就成了飞行员医疗专家，别提我不是医生了。把胳膊伸出来，"她一边说着，嘴角还夹着烟，用带子绕在明日香的手臂上测量血压。明日香心想，这女人需要的不是咖啡因和尼古丁，而是一场好觉。在体检时抽烟！太不专业了。看来所有成年人都是这样，不只是美里和加持。接下来她该不会开始讲些下流的笑话吧。

Noting down the pilot's blood pressure on her clipboard, Akagi moved on to the rest of her exam, continuing to puff away at her cigarette. Taking temperature, testing reflexes, peering into ears, nose, and throat, everything was poked, gauged, or otherwise tested, with the results recorded. Akagi's cigarette did not last the whole exam, but Asuka's irritation did; even being used to long screenings, the doctor's endeavors were irksome to the pilot.  
在记录板上记下飞行员的血压后，赤木继续进行其余的检查，一边抽着烟。测量体温，测试反射，检查耳朵、鼻子和喉咙，每一项都被触碰、评估或测试，结果被记录下来。赤木的烟并没有持续整个检查过程，但明日香的烦躁却一直持续；尽管习惯了长时间的筛查，医生的努力还是让飞行员感到恼火。

_She thinks I'm not good enough to work with her, but she admits she's unqualified for this! What a hypocrite.  
她觉得我不够格与她共事，可她自己也承认没资格做这事！真是虚伪。_

"Hold out your right arm," Doctor Akagi said, washing her hands at the small sink in the exam room and putting on gloves. As Asuka held out her arm, the doctor pulled out a few empty vials and a needle from the table next to the bed. Her setup complete, she roughly grabbed Asuka's arm and searched for a vein, disinfecting a spot in the crook of the girl's elbow before slipping the needle in.  
"伸出你的右臂，" 赤城医生说道，她在检查室的小水槽边洗手并戴上手套。当明日香伸出她的手臂时，医生从床边的桌子上拿出几个空瓶和一根针。一切准备就绪后，她粗鲁地抓住明日香的手臂，寻找静脉，在女孩肘部的弯处消毒后，将针头插入。

"While I've got you here," she said, as she inserted the first vial into the needle, and it began to fill up with blood. "I've got some ground rules for the terms of your _assistance_ in Section One."  
"既然你在这里，" 她一边说，一边将第一个瓶子插入针头，血液开始充满瓶子。"我有一些关于你在第一部门协助的基本规则要告诉你。"

Asuka looked at the doctor questioningly. "I assumed my request was denied," she said flatly. "I hadn't heard anything about, even after I got here."  
明日香疑惑地看着医生。"我以为我的请求被拒绝了，" 她平淡地说道，"我甚至在这里之后也没听到任何关于这方面的消息。"

"Number one," the doctor continued, ignoring Asuka's statement while she changed out the full vial for an empty one. "This is a professional organization. You will carry yourself in a professional manner." She narrowed her eyes at Asuka. "I'm well aware of your reputation from some of my colleagues in Berlin. I will not tolerate that behavior here."  
"第一点，"医生继续说道，无视明日香的话，同时将满瓶换成空瓶。"这是一个专业机构。你必须以专业态度行事。"她眯起眼睛盯着明日香。"我从柏林的一些同事那里听说过你的名声。我在这里不会容忍那种行为。"

Asuka clenched her jaw. _My reputation?! And how exactly is it my fault if I'm surrounded by incompetent idiots that only respond to threats of force to do their jobs right?!_ "Professional. Of course," she said calmly after discreetly letting out a long breath.  
明日香紧咬牙关。我的名声？！如果我身边尽是些无能的蠢货，只有靠武力威胁才能让他们好好工作，这又怎么怪我呢？！“专业，当然。”她平静地说道，暗自长舒了一口气。

Akagi smirked, once again changing out a full vial for an empty one. "Good. Number two: while you still fall under Captain Katsuragi's authority in Section Three, and I've been informed your activities there supersede your potential work in Section One, I expect you to clear your schedule through me before going to the captain with any of your training plan moving forward."  
赤城轻蔑地一笑，再次将一个满瓶换成了空瓶。“很好。第二点：尽管你在第三分队仍受葛城队长管辖，且我已得知你在那里的活动优先于第一分队的潜在工作，但我要求你今后在向队长提交任何训练计划前，必须先通过我这一关。”

Asuka fought back her initial instinct to scream at the good doctor. _Work for you?! You're lucky I'm gracing your labs with my presence! Who the hell do you think you are?!_ "I'll make sure to keep you informed of my schedule, Doctor," she said stiffly.  
明日香强压下最初想要对这位好医生尖叫的冲动。为你工作？！你该庆幸我大驾光临你的实验室！你以为你是谁啊？！“我会确保让你知晓我的日程安排，医生，”她僵硬地说道。

The doctor slipped the needle out of Asuka's arm and relinquished control of it to the pilot before quickly slapping a band-aid over the tiny wound. "Good. That's it, actually. For the exam, and for my ground rules. You can get dressed, but don't leave," she said. The doctor left the filled vials on their stand atop the table and disposed of the used needle. "Someone will stop by later with some evaluation forms for you to fill out."  
医生从明日香的胳膊上拔出针头，将控制权交还给驾驶员，然后迅速在微小的伤口上贴上创可贴。“好了，就这样。考试和我的规定都完成了。你可以穿衣服，但别离开，”她说道。医生将装满的试管留在桌上的架子上，并处理了用过的针头。“稍后会有人来给你送评估表格填写。”

Picking her coffee cup and clipboard back up, Akagi walked briskly towards the exit. "You've got more tests tomorrow, as you're aware. I'll see you then." The door shut behind her.  
赤木律子重新拿起她的咖啡杯和夹板，快步走向出口。“你知道明天还有更多测试。到时候见。”她身后的门关上了。

Asuka breathed in and out deeply, slowly, closing her eyes and rubbing her temples. _This is going to be more of a challenge than I thought._ She got up from the bed and reached for her clothes, preparing to wait around for another few hours for the next person to come by with the subsequent annoyance of the day.  
明日香深呼吸，慢慢地闭上眼睛，揉着太阳穴。这比我想象的要更具挑战性。她从床上起身，伸手去拿衣服，准备再等上几个小时，等待下一个人带着当天的下一个麻烦到来。

Ω

Asuka stood at the edge of NERV's Olympic sized swimming pool, glaring angrily at the doorway to the men's locker room. The clock on the wall behind her read 1702.  
明日香站在 NERV 奥运标准游泳池的边缘，愤怒地瞪着男更衣室的门口。她身后的墙上挂钟显示着 17 点 02 分。

_Everyone has been wasting my time all day. Of course the Idiot would too._ She crossed her arms and sighed theatrically when she noticed the door open and a _very_ nervous looking Third Child in swimming trunks and a t-shirt hesitantly stepped towards her.  
今天一整天，所有人都浪费我的时间。那个白痴当然也不例外。她双臂交叉，戏剧性地叹了口气，注意到门打开，一个看起来非常紧张的第三适格者穿着泳裤和 T 恤，犹豫地向她走来。

Raising one eyebrow, she waved towards herself in a _hurry up_ gesture; the boy mostly complied, elongating his stride to a mostly normal length, and coming to a stop in front of her. His head was down, and his eyes were cast to the side rather than focused on the girl in front of him.  
她扬起一边眉毛，急切地招手示意他过来；男孩大致顺从了，将步伐拉长至接近正常长度，停在她面前。他低着头，目光偏向一旁，并未直视眼前的女孩。

_Oh, come_ on_, Shinji! Grow a pair! I didn't even wear a bikini this time! Pervert._ Asuka had considered that the Third Child might be too bashful to effectively teach and had attempted to head off that concern by opting for a more conservative one-piece swimsuit she had been issued in Berlin. Asuka again sighed loudly and ostentatiously, rolling her eyes.  
哎呀，真嗣，拿出点男子气概来！我这次连比基尼都没穿呢！色狼。明日香早就考虑到第三适格者可能太过害羞，无法有效教学，因此特意选择了在柏林时配发的那件更为保守的一体式泳衣，试图打消他的顾虑。她再次大声且夸张地叹了口气，翻了个白眼。

"I'm Asuka, Asuka Langley Soryu. Charmed, huh?" She said, smiling when the boy in front of her finally looked up to meet her eyes. He hesitantly returned her smile.  
"我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。很高兴认识你，嗯？" 她说着，当面前的男孩终于抬头与她对视时，她露出了微笑。他犹豫地回以微笑。

"I'm Shinji Ikari," he said, eyes flicking to the pool behind her and back to her face. "Um, sorry, but what do I call you? Misato-san told me—"  
"我是碇真嗣，" 他说，目光迅速扫过她身后的泳池，又回到她的脸上。"呃，抱歉，但我该怎么称呼你？美里小姐告诉我的——"

"Whatever Misato told you was wrong!" Asuka quicky interrupted _that_ particular train of thought before the Third Child began calling her something ridiculous. _And already he's at it with the apologies!_ "Just call me Asuka. Or Second Child, or Pilot Soryu, if you don't go in for the whole brevity thing," she informed him.  
"美里告诉你的都不对！" 明日香迅速打断了那条思路，以免第三适格者开始用什么荒谬的称呼叫她。而且他已经又开始道歉了！"就叫我明日香吧。或者第二适格者，或者驾驶员惣流，如果你不喜欢简洁的话，" 她告诉他。

"Ok, Asuka," he said, his smile becoming a bit more confident before his eyes settled once again on the pool and his face turned a bit perplexed. "I, uh, I know Misato-san said that we were going to be in the pool today, but—but I don't know how to swim. Sorry." He said the last few words quickly and quietly, as if the lower volume would make the information less offensive to their intended recipient.  
“好的，明日香，”他说道，笑容中多了几分自信，目光再次落在泳池上，脸上露出一丝困惑。“我，呃，我知道美里小姐说我们今天要下水，但是——但是我不会游泳。对不起。”他最后几句话快速而轻声地说出，仿佛降低音量就能让这条信息对接受者不那么冒犯。

Asuka smirked. "Luckily for you, Third Child, the Great Asuka Langley Soryu foresaw this predicament and planned for just such an occasion!" She grabbed the boy in front of her by his wrist and dragged him up to the edge of the pool and waved her hand dramatically over the shallow end of the pool before them. "I shall teach you to swim myself!"  
明日香得意地笑了笑。"算你走运，第三适格者，伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷早已预见到这个困境，并为这样的场合做好了准备！" 她抓住面前男孩的手腕，将他拽到泳池边，夸张地挥手在两人面前的浅水区上方。"我要亲自教你游泳！"

Shinji's eyes had widened in surprise when the girl had grabbed his wrist, and they widened even further at her grandiose proclamations. "Humans aren't meant to float," he whispered just barely loud enough for Asuka to hear.  
当女孩抓住他的手腕时，真嗣的眼睛惊讶地睁大了，而听到她那夸张的宣言时，他的眼睛更是瞪得更大了。“人类不应该漂浮的。”他低声说道，声音刚好能让明日香听到。

She shook her head in response. "Nonsense," she replied. "Now take that shirt off, we're getting into the water." she said, gesturing to the boy's torso. He cautiously removed the shirt, folding it neatly and looking around for a safe place to stow it. Asuka, however, grabbed it out of his hands and tossed it back towards the door to the men's locker rooms.  
她摇了摇头作为回应。“胡说，”她回答道，“现在把那件衬衫脱掉，我们要下水了。”她指着男孩的胸膛说道。他小心翼翼地脱下衬衫，整齐地叠好，四处寻找一个安全的地方存放。然而，明日香从他手中夺过衬衫，扔回了男更衣室的方向。

"Hey!" He said, a genuine flash of irritation breaking his timid mask. Asuka smirked in response. _Good._ "What was that for?"  
“嘿！”他真的生气了，打破了平时胆怯的面具。明日香回应了一个得意的微笑。很好。“你这是干什么？”

Rather than respond, Asuka's smirk deepened as she placed a hand on the Third Child's shoulder, who did not have time to react before she pushed him into the pool. Asuka giggled as he thrashed in the water for a bit. "Just stand up, Idiot, the water is only up to your waist," she said before slipping smoothly into the water herself.  
阿斯克并未回应，反而嘴角的笑意更浓，她一手搭在第三适格者的肩上，趁其未及反应之际将他推入池中。阿斯克咯咯笑着，看着他在水中扑腾了一会儿。“站起来就行了，傻瓜，水才到你腰呢。”她话音刚落，便轻盈地滑入水中。

"What the hell, Asuka!" Shinji yelled after he got his footing and cleared the water from his nose and mouth. "I just told you I can't swim!"  
“搞什么鬼，明日香！”真嗣站稳后，一边清理着鼻子和嘴里的水，一边喊道，“我刚跟你说过我不会游泳的！”

"And I just told you I'm teaching you to swim," Asuka sweetly replied. "Lesson one: to swim, you have to be in the water." _There's that spine. Just keep this up, Shinji._  
“我刚刚才告诉你，我要教你游泳。”明日香甜甜地回答，“第一课：要游泳，你得先下水。”脊梁骨还在呢。就这样保持下去，真嗣。

The boy's angry glare remained. "You could have warned me," he said indignantly.  
男孩愤怒的瞪视依旧未变。“你本可以提醒我的。”他愤愤不平地说。

Asuka shrugged. "Maybe. Now, let's get started," she said. "Come on over to the edge here, so you can hold onto it. I'm going to teach you how to tread water and we need to move into deeper water."  
明日香耸了耸肩。“也许吧。现在，我们开始吧，”她说道，“过来这边，抓住边缘。我要教你如何踩水，我们需要进入更深的水域。”

Shinji worked his way next to her, warily not taking his eyes off of her as he grabbed onto the edge and scooted along down it to get to the deeper water, Asuka swimming beside him.  
真嗣小心翼翼地挪到她旁边，目光始终没有离开她，他抓住边缘，沿着它慢慢移动到更深的水域，明日香则在他身边游泳。

"Swimming is great exercise," Asuka explained imperiously. "It's low impact, so you have a decreased chance to injure yourself, but still high intensity—if you do it right." She had moved further from the edge to give Shinji a better view of the way her arms and legs were moving. "Even just treading water like I am right now can be a good cardiovascular exercise. Try to emulate the way I'm moving," she instructed.  
"游泳是极好的锻炼方式，"明日香傲然解释道，"它对关节冲击小，因此受伤风险较低，但强度依然很高——只要你做对了。" 她向泳池中央挪了挪，以便真嗣能更清楚地看到她四肢的动作。"就像我现在这样踩水，也能很好地锻炼心肺功能。试着模仿我的动作，"她指导说。

Slowly releasing one hand from the edge of the pool, Shinji began to kick his legs and circulate his arm the way the other pilot was. He was staying afloat, but mostly due to his grip on the edge.  
缓缓地从泳池边缘松开一只手，真嗣开始按照另一位驾驶员的方式踢腿并挥动手臂。他勉强能浮在水面上，但主要还是依靠紧抓着边缘的力量。

"You've got to let go," Asuka told him, rolling her eyes.  
“你得放手，”明日香告诉他，翻了个白眼。

"But I can't swim! I still don't have the hang of this," Shinji was concentrating on moving his legs and arm correctly and did not spare Asuka a look—he subsequently jerked in surprised when she appeared next to him, having swam over from her previous position.  
"但我不会游泳！我还是不太熟练，" 真嗣正专注于正确地移动他的腿和手臂，没有分心去看明日香——当她从之前的位置游到他旁边时，他随即惊讶地一颤。

"I'm right here, Idiot," she told him. "You really think the Great Asuka Langley Soryu is going to let one of her students drown?"  
"我就在这儿，笨蛋，" 她对他说。"你真的以为伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷会让自己学生淹死吗？"

"Erm—sorry," he said, his efforts at treading water abandoned and his gaze averted to the side.  
“呃——抱歉，”他说道，放弃了踩水的努力，目光转向一旁。

Asuka sighed and rolled her eyes for what felt like the ten thousandth time today. _And here comes the kicked puppy._ "The answer to that question is _no_. If you had any doubts about that," she added icily.  
明日香叹了口气，今天似乎已经是她今天第十万次翻白眼了。又来了，那副被踢了的小狗模样。“那个问题的答案是‘不’。如果你对此还有任何疑虑，”她冷冷地补充道。

"Right," he said, still not meeting her eyes. A faint blush was also making its way onto his cheeks.  
“嗯，”他说道，依旧没有直视她的眼睛。一抹淡淡的红晕也悄然爬上了他的脸颊。

_Argh, this pervert!_ Asuka thought. _He should be focused on not drowning, not on—that!_ She bit back the scornful remark she wanted to give and pressed on.  
啊，这个变态！明日香心想。他应该专注于不溺水，而不是——那个！她忍住了想要嘲讽的话，继续前进。

"Come on, Third," she said commandingly. "Let's go. We've got limited time to work with, and you're wasting it."  
“快点，第三适格者，”她命令道，“我们时间有限，你别浪费了。”

"Right. Um, sorry," he said, beginning to try to tread water again and slowly letting go of the edge of the pool. He maintained his head above water for a few moments but soon began sinking, causing him to panic and reach back out for the edge while Asuka wrapped an arm around his upper torso to steady him.  
“好的。呃，抱歉，”他说着，开始尝试再次踩水，并慢慢放开泳池边缘。他保持头部在水面上几秒钟，但很快又开始下沉，这让他惊慌失措，伸手想要再次抓住边缘，而明日香则用一只手臂环住他的上半身，稳住他。

At the close contact both of the teens were blushing. _No! Focus, Asuka! What is wrong with you?_ She quickly made sure Shinji was securely holding on to the edge and separated herself from him, clearing her throat and fighting against her blush.  
在紧密接触中，两个少年都脸红了。不！集中精神，明日香！你怎么了？她迅速确认真嗣牢牢抓住了边缘，然后从他身边退开，清了清嗓子，努力抑制住自己的脸红。

"Right, see?" She said, attempting to skip over the awkwardness. "No danger of drowning here. Now give it another go and try to get the rhythm of the movement right before you let go all of the way; then you can just incorporate your other arm into the flow of things."  
"看，明白了吗？" 她说道，试图跳过尴尬。"这里没有溺水的危险。现在再试一次，在你完全放手之前，先掌握好动作的节奏；然后你就可以把另一只手臂也融入到这个动作中。"

"Right. Ok." He replied, seemingly relieved and also choosing to ignore the mortifying ordeal. The pair of them continued at this for several more attempts before he became familiar enough with the movement to be able to comfortably tread water on his own, though only within arm's reach of the edge of the pool. Asuka had only needed to impose herself between the boy and the depths of the pool twice more, both times filled with the same unacknowledged embarrassment.  
"好的，明白了。" 他回答道，似乎松了一口气，也选择忽略那令人尴尬的经历。他们又继续尝试了几次，直到他熟悉了动作，能够独自舒适地踩水，尽管只是在泳池边缘伸手可及的范围内。明日香只得再次两次介入，将男孩与泳池的深水区隔开，每次都充满了未被承认的尴尬。

_This is going to be the longest hour of training I've ever had,_ Asuka lamented to herself as she directed Shinji back to the shallow end of the pool to work on more swimming basics.  
这将会是我经历过的最漫长的一小时训练，明日香自言自语地抱怨着，同时指挥真嗣回到泳池浅水区，继续练习游泳基础。

Ω

After her time spent in the pool, showering, changing, acquiring dinner, and making her way back to her apartment in the Geofront, Asuka was finally taking a moment to relax from her first official duty day. _This wasn't exactly what I expected, but things largely seem to be going according to plan,_ she thought as she flopped onto her bed. _I actually got further with the Idiot than I thought I would_. She smiled to herself at that thought.  
在泳池里泡过澡，冲了淋浴，换了衣服，买了晚餐，又一路回到地底都市的公寓后，明日香终于得以在首个正式执勤日结束后稍作喘息。这并非我完全预料中的模样，但大体上似乎一切都在按计划进行，她想着便扑倒在床上。我居然和那个白痴进展得比预想中顺利。想到这里，她不禁自顾自地笑了。

Following most of an hour spent going over the fundamentals of not drowning, Asuka had managed to get Shinji to paddle around a bit in the shallow end of the pool—his confidence not yet extending to deeper waters, and Asuka accepting that there's only so much one can expect in such a short time. _Still, he did pretty well. All things considered that time in the pool was the least annoying part of the day._  
经过近一个小时的基本不溺水知识讲解，明日香成功让真嗣在泳池浅水区划了几圈——他的自信尚未延伸至深水区，而明日香也明白在如此短时间内不能期望太多。不过，他表现得相当不错。总的来说，那次在泳池里的时光是当天最不烦人的部分。

Asuka glanced at the training plan binder on the desk across from her bed. _Next time I'm staying for my own workout after Shinji's is over. I'm going to lose my edge if I let his schedule dictate my workouts._ Resolving to pencil in her own plans into the calendar sometime later, she sat up and stretched.  
明日香瞥了一眼床对面桌上的训练计划夹。下次我要在真嗣训练结束后继续自己的锻炼。如果让他的日程决定我的训练，我会失去优势的。她决定稍后在日历上填入自己的计划，然后坐起身来伸展了一下。

_Still_, she thought, _all this talk of schedules, and I don't know the most important one._ She reached for a magazine she had left scattered on the floor. Cognizant of the constant surveillance she was under, she was still unsure if Section Two had gone so far as to put cameras in her quarters but wanted to err on the side of caution. It seemed better, in her opinion, to be seen aimlessly flipping through a magazine than to be seen brooding or furiously taking notes only to subsequently tear them up.  
尽管如此，她想，尽是些日程安排的讨论，而我连最重要的那个都不清楚。她伸手去拿散落在地板上的一本杂志。意识到自己时刻处于监视之下，她仍不确定第二部门是否已极端到在她的住处安装摄像头，但宁愿谨慎为上。在她看来，被人看到漫无目的地翻阅杂志，总比被发现沉思或愤怒地做笔记再撕毁要好。

With her cover in place, she began wracking her brain for any hint of a date for the arrival of the next Angel. _Oh, I really should have been paying attention_, she bemoaned. _More simulator time didn't mean shit!_ She huffed and turned a page with contempt. _But how was I supposed to know that? This isn't my fault. Argh, this isn't helping! When does the next one show up?!_  
掩护已就绪，她开始绞尽脑汁回想下一位天使降临的任何线索。哦，我真该多加留意的，她懊恼地想。模拟训练再多也毫无意义！她气呼呼地翻过一页，带着轻蔑。但我怎么可能预知到呢？这又不是我的错。啊，这样下去毫无进展！下一个到底什么时候来？！

### Chapter 5

Εγώ σκόροδα σοι λὲγω, συ δε κρόμμυα αποκρίνει (I talk to you about garlics and you respond about onions) — An old saying  
我跟你谈大蒜，你却回应洋葱——一句古老的谚语

Asuka relaxed into her seat inside the entry plug as the familiar sensation of blood-warm LCL filling her lungs spread through her chest. _Even if it's just for some scans, it's good to be back in an entry plug,_ she thought. A contented grin spread on her face. _This is where I belong._  
明日香放松地坐在插入栓内，随着熟悉的血液般温暖的 LCL 充盈肺部，这种感觉在胸腔中蔓延开来。尽管只是为了进行一些扫描，能回到插入栓里感觉真好，她想。满意的微笑在她脸上绽放。这才是我该在的地方。

"Sorry, but this will probably take a few hours, so make yourself comfortable, Asuka," came Doctor Akagi's mousey assistant's voice over the radio. Asuka had still not learned her name, despite having heard it quite a few times now.  
“抱歉，但这可能需要几个小时，所以请自便，明日香。”传来赤木博士那胆小的助手通过无线电的声音。尽管已经听过好几次了，明日香还是没能记住她的名字。

_What, does she think I've never been sequestered in an entry plug all day before? Honestly, they've had the Commander's doll here for years, why don't they seem to know much about pilots?_ "Let's just get this started, Lieutenant," she said, leaving her rank dangling at the end of her transmission as she searched for a name. _Suzuki? Isuzu? Ok, I'm going to remember her name for real this time. Once I figure it out._ She elected to not venture a guess as to the woman's name.  
什么，她以为我从未在插入栓里待上一整天吗？说实话，他们把司令的玩偶放在这里这么多年了，怎么对驾驶员的了解还这么少？“我们开始吧，中尉。”她说着，在通讯结束时故意不提自己的军衔，同时努力回想那个名字。铃木？五十铃？好吧，这次我一定要记住她的名字。一旦我弄清楚。她决定不冒险猜测那个女人的名字。

"Oh, just call me Maya," she replied lightly. _Maya—Ok. Maya. Maaayyyyaaa. Got it._ "The equipment's ready to go, and I'm starting the program now. Once it's finished and you've washed up you can come up here and cross-reference the results with your records from Berlin for Doctor Akagi."  
"哦，就叫我玛雅吧，"她轻松地回答。玛雅——好。玛雅。玛——雅——明白了。"设备已经准备就绪，我现在就开始运行程序。完成后你洗漱一下，就可以上来和你的柏林记录进行交叉比对，给赤木博士看。"

"Actually," the aforementioned Doctor Akagi interrupted, "slight change of plans. Once the scans are finished, Asuka, you're going to attempt an activation test with Unit 01."  
"实际上，"赤木博士打断道，"计划稍有变动。扫描完成后，明日香，你将尝试与 01 号机进行激活测试。"

Despite herself, Asuka's eyes widened slightly in surprise. _Come on_, she chided herself, _you knew this was going to happen. You planned for it to happen. You_ wanted _it to happen. It's the only Eva available to pilot right now. What use are you if you're not piloting?_ She slowly circulated LCL in and out of her lungs in a facsimile of breathing in an effort to keep her heartrate calm. _There's nothing to be concerned about. It's just the dumb test type._  
尽管她自己也不愿承认，明日香的眼中还是闪过一丝惊讶。别这样，她自责道，你知道这迟早会发生。你计划了它的发生。你希望它发生。现在只有 01 号机可供驾驶。如果你不驾驶，那还有什么用？她缓缓地让 LCL 在肺部循环，模仿着呼吸，试图保持心率平稳。没什么好担心的。只是个普通的测试型罢了。

"Well, it certainly won't hold a candle to my Unit 02," she boasted, frowning and turning her nose up at the idea of lowering herself to pilot an inferior Eva. "But I suppose we make do with what we have available."  
"好吧，它当然比不上我的 02 号机，"她自夸道，皱着眉头，对驾驶一架次等 Eva 的想法嗤之以鼻。"但我想我们只能凑合着用现有的了。"

"Right," Akagi snorted. "Regardless, I don't expect you to be able to sync; the test type is a bit, well, temperamental. You just make the attempt and after that I want you up here going over that data for me."  
"没错，"赤木哼了一声。"不管怎样，我不指望你能同步；测试机型有点，嗯，喜怒无常。你只需尝试一下，之后我要你上来帮我分析那些数据。"

Asuka rolled her eyes. _Temperamental. Sure. The exact opposite of its designated pilot, more like. If he can pilot Unit 01, then there's no way I'll fail at it!_ "I'll show you how it's done. Let's get going on these scans, I want to synch with an Eva again!" Her brazenness restored, Asuka settled her hands on the control yokes mounted in front of her, gripping them tightly.  
明日香翻了个白眼。喜怒无常。当然。更像是与指定驾驶员完全相反。如果他能驾驶 01 号机，那我绝不可能失败！"我会让你看看该怎么做。让我们开始这些扫描吧，我想再次与 Eva 同步！"明日香恢复了自信，双手放在面前的控制杆上，紧紧握住。

Ω

"That wraps up the scanning, Asuka." Maya's voice pierced through the not-quite-sleeping yet not-quite-waking zone the pilot normally inhabited for extended periods in an entry plug, bringing the girl's full attention back to the outside world. "Give us a second to switch some things over and we can get started on the synch attempt. No need to get out of the entry plug."  
"扫描完成了，明日香。" 真希波的声音穿透了驾驶员通常长时间沉浸在插入栓中的半睡半醒状态，将女孩的全部注意力拉回到外部世界。"给我们一点时间切换一些设备，我们就可以开始同步尝试了。不需要离开插入栓。"

"Right," Asuka said off-handedly. She'd spent most of the past few hours mulling over what she could remember of what happened in Japan before she had arrived the first time but was ultimately still frustrated by her lack of knowledge on the subject. _It's already been ten days since the first one showed up. Most of them were only a couple weeks apart—if that. But what was the longest time between attacks? It had to have been those 30 days when the Idiot was hiding inside Unit 01._  
"好的，" 明日香随口应道。过去几个小时里，她大部分时间都在回想自己第一次到达日本之前发生的事情，但最终还是因为对这个话题的知识匮乏而感到沮丧。第一次出现已经过去十天了。它们大多数相隔只有几周——甚至更短。但最长的攻击间隔是多久？一定是那 30 天，当那个白痴躲在初号机里的时候。

"We're set up on our end, are you ready to begin?" Maya asked.  
"我们这边准备好了，你准备好开始了吗？" 真希波问道。

Asuka scoffed in response, abandoning her train of thought. "Bring it on!" She barked.  
明日香嗤之以鼻，打断了思绪。“放马过来！”她厉声喝道。

The normal sounds of a synch test floated around her in the entry plug, but she had long ago learned to tune them out, only listening for a hiccup in the process. Instead, she focused on grabbing for the impending connection between herself and the Eva.  
插入栓内同步测试的常规声响环绕着她，但她早已学会屏蔽这些噪音，只留意过程中是否有异常。相反，她全神贯注于即将建立的自己与 EVA 之间的联系。

_Come on, come on_, she thought, waiting for the tenuous first contact that would blossom into a full connection in her grip and the feeling of _completeness_ that she craved. _Stop hiding from me, damn it!_ Unit 01, however, was not being forthcoming.  
快点，快点，她心想，等待着那脆弱的初次接触，那将在她手中绽放成完全连接的感觉，以及她渴望的完整感。别再躲着我了，该死的！但 01 号机却迟迟不回应。

She could hear the tones of the voices from the operations center where they were supervising the test change as they nattered about _borderlines_ and _plug depth_ and _pyschographs_, but Asuka continued to pay them no mind. Instead, her growing frustration was turning into panic as the feeling of being unable to synchronize with the Eva brought back emotions she had thought discarded—reminders of a time when even her Unit 02 no longer wanted her, of being useless, of being rejected. Waiting to die.  
她能听到从操作中心传来的声音，那里的人们正监督着测试变更，喋喋不休地讨论着边界线、插头深度和心理图谱，但明日香依旧对他们置之不理。相反，随着与 Eva 同步的无力感愈发强烈，她逐渐由沮丧转为恐慌，那些曾以为已抛弃的情感再次涌上心头——想起连二号机都不要她的时刻，感到自己无用、被排斥，等待着死亡的降临。

_No. No! I'm a pilot! You're just a stupid doll, you'll do what I say!_ Asuka desperately reached towards the figurative place in her mind where she knew her connection to the Eva should be, trying to wrap her fingers around what was not there as tightly as she could.  
不，不！我是驾驶员！你只是个愚蠢的玩偶，照我说的做！明日香拼命地伸向心中那个象征着与 Eva 连接的虚幻之地，试图尽可能紧地抓住那本不存在的东西。

"We're halting the test," she heard Doctor Akagi say, the words cutting through her filter. Asuka's eyes shot open wide, and her mouth twisted with a snarl.  
“我们暂停测试，”她听到赤木博士说，这句话穿透了她的心防。明日香的双眼猛地睁大，嘴角因愤怒而扭曲。

"Start it again," she growled. _I will not be useless. Work, you stupid doll!_ "I can do this." _I_ will _do this_.  
“重新开始，”她咆哮道。我不会无用武之地。动起来，你这笨玩偶！“我能做到。”我一定会做到。

"You're going to relax first, is what you're going to do," Akagi admonished. "I already told you I don't expect this to work, but surely you've done enough synch tests to know that you need to be calm and have a clear head? You _do_ so often remind everyone of how long you've been training to be a pilot."  
“你得先放松，这是你要做的。”赤城告诫道，“我已经告诉过你，我不指望这能成功，但你肯定做过足够的同步测试，知道需要保持冷静、头脑清醒吧？你经常提醒大家你训练成为飞行员有多久。”

Asuka's eyes flashed in anger, but she bit her tongue on the riposte she intended to deliver to the doctor. _Bitch_. She repeated her mimicry of breathing, the well-known but still odd sensation of LCL slowly churning in and out of her lungs helping to stabilize her. _She's right. But still a bitch._ "Give me a moment, Doctor," she said flatly, closing her eyes.  
明日香眼中闪过怒火，但她忍住了原本要向医生回敬的反驳。这个泼妇。她重复着呼吸模仿的动作，那种熟悉的、仍显怪异的 LCL 在肺部缓缓进出搅动的感觉帮助她稳定了情绪。她说得没错。但依旧是个泼妇。“给我一点时间，医生。”她平淡地说道，闭上了眼睛。

"Take your time, Asuka," came the response. "We'll try again when you're ready."  
“慢慢来，明日香。”传来回应，“等你准备好了，我们再试一次。”

Choosing to believe that Akagi was not being condescending, Asuka folded her legs into her chest, buried her face in her knees, and wrapped her arms around her legs—having just enough presence of mind to ensure the camera feed was switched off. _You're not useless. You're Asuka Langley Soryu, the best Eva pilot in the world. You did not come all this way, through all this bullshit, to be undone by a stubborn piece of obsolete equipment._ _You're not being rejected. They need you. They can't just throw you away. I'm not some trash they can toss aside. I don't care if they hate me—_they _need_ me_, not the other way around._  
选择相信赤木律子并非在居高临下，明日香将双腿蜷缩至胸前，脸埋在膝盖间，双臂环绕着双腿——还留有一丝清醒确保摄像头已关闭。你并非无用之人。你是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，世界上最优秀的 Eva 驾驶员。你历经千辛万苦，穿越重重困境，不会被一件顽固的过时设备所击败。你并未被抛弃。他们需要你。他们不能轻易将你抛弃。我不是他们可以随意丢弃的垃圾。我不在乎他们是否恨我——他们需要我，而非我依赖他们。

She hugged her legs tighter to herself. _My first time synching with an Eva since that fight where—that's it!_ Her head snapped back up. _Momma was with me in that fight, and piloting felt totally different!_ She recalled the ease with which she moved and flowed with Unit 02 at the time; while her normal piloting was, of course, quite elegant (in her opinion), her experience in her final battle had been of truly being one with her Eva.  
她更紧地抱住自己的双腿。自从那场战斗后，这是我第一次与 Eva 同步——对了！她的头猛地抬起。妈妈在那场战斗中与我同在，驾驶的感觉完全不同！她回想起当时与二号机流畅自如的配合；尽管她平时的驾驶已然相当优雅（在她看来），但那场最终决战中的体验，才是真正与 Eva 融为一体的感觉。

Unbidden, she recalled some unsolicited advice she had received from the First Child. _"Open my heart," huh? I guess that's what I did then._ She released her legs and resumed a proper seated position in the entry plug. _Momma is watching over me in Unit 02. Who's taking care of Shinji in Unit 01? Only one way to find out!_ She reactivated her camera feed and looked to Doctor Akagi.  
不由自主地，她回想起初号机那位给予的未经请求的建议。“敞开心扉”，呵？我想我当时确实这么做了。她松开双腿，重新在插入栓内坐正。妈妈在二号机里守护着我。谁在照顾一号机里的真嗣呢？只有一个办法能知道！她重新激活了摄像头，望向赤木博士。

"I'm ready to try again, Doctor."  
“我准备好再试一次了，博士。”

Akagi looked up from the screen she had been reading from, meeting Asuka's eyes over the monitor. "Excellent. Let's start again, shall we?" She said, gesturing to Maya with one hand while raising her coffee mug to her lips with the other.  
赤木律子从她正在阅读的屏幕上抬起头，透过显示器与明日香的目光相遇。“很好。我们重新开始，好吗？”她一边说，一边用一只手示意伊吹摩耶，另一只手则举起咖啡杯送到嘴边。

Once more Asuka tuned out the sounds of a synch test as she felt for the threads of a tie to Unit 01. Rather than trying to seize at a link and impose her will on the Eva, as she normally would, she instead tried to wait patiently for the connection to manifest itself.  
明日香再次屏蔽了同步测试的声音，她感受着与初号机之间的纽带。这一次，她没有像往常那样试图抓住连接并强加自己的意志于 EVA 上，而是耐心等待着这种联系自然显现。

This went on for several minutes. _Keep calm, Asuka_, she thought. _NERV's favorite hobby is wasting your time, it stands to reason their test type would do the same._  
这种情况持续了好几分钟。保持冷静，明日香，她想。NERV 最喜欢的消遣就是浪费你的时间，他们的测试机型自然也会如法炮制。

Several more minutes passed, with no connection to the Eva forthcoming. _This is getting tiresome. Like always, I need to be the one to initiate things around here._ She mimed taking a deep breath, the LCL feeling heavy in her chest, and hazarded a guess. _Mrs. Ikari?_  
又过了好几分钟，依然没有与 Eva 建立连接。这真是越来越烦人了。一如既往，我得是那个主动出击的人。她模仿着深吸一口气，LCL 在胸中感觉沉重，然后试探性地猜测道。碇太太？

Asuka waited a moment, but she did not feel anything happen. _Well, it was worth a shot. Maybe she's not in there after all. But then who would be? Does every Eva have someone inside of it, or is it just my Unit 02? Momma was in Unit 02, and she spent years working on it before she—before. Didn't Shinji's mom work on Unit 01?_ She tried to remember some of the conversations she had had with the Third Child but could not recall him ever speaking of his mother outside of the one time he went to visit her grave, nor did she remember him mentioning anyone else who might fit the bill for "guardian spirit inside the Eva." _I suppose mothers were a bit of a taboo subject for both of us_, she thought.  
明日香等了一会儿，却什么也没感觉到。唉，姑且一试吧。或许她根本不在里面。但若非如此，又会是谁呢？难道每一台 Eva 里都有人存在，还是仅限于我的二号机？妈妈曾在二号机里，她在那之前多年一直致力于此——在那之前。真嗣的妈妈不是也参与过零一号机的研发吗？她试图回忆与第三适格者的一些对话，却记不起他除了那次去扫墓外，还谈及过他的母亲，也不记得他提过其他可能符合“Eva 中的守护灵”身份的人。想来，母亲这个话题对我们俩都有些避讳吧，她心想。

Recalling the times when she had been happily interacting with the Third Child brought to mind other pleasant times she had spent with him. _Showing off my Unit 02 when Misato brought him out to the fleet, and that week we spent learning that stupid dance to kick that Angel's ass._ She blushed slightly at that memory—and his confession that he had almost kissed her while she was sleeping. _That little pervert. He won't even do anything._  
回想起她曾与三笠愉快互动的时光，脑海中浮现出与他共度的其他美好时刻。在美里带他参观舰队时炫耀我的零二机，还有那一周我们为了痛扁那个使徒而学的蠢舞。想到那段记忆，她脸上微微泛红——以及他坦白说在她熟睡时差点吻了她。那个小色鬼。他甚至什么都没做。

As her mind wandered over the subject of the Third Child, she started to become aware of the feeling of a growing presence. _But he had his good moments too, I guess,_ she thought absentmindedly. _Teaching him to swim yesterday was kind of fun. And what he did in that volcano_, her thought trailed off as she lost herself to that harrowing moment.  
当她的思绪飘向第三适格者的话题时，她开始意识到一种逐渐增强的存在感。不过，我想他也有他的优点吧，她心不在焉地想着。昨天教他游泳还挺有趣的。还有他在火山里做的事，她的思绪飘散开来，沉浸在那段惊心动魄的回忆中。

She reminisced on how relieved and happy she felt when she had looked up to see Shinji in Unit 01 holding onto her in Unit 02, the lot of them being raised to safety. _It's too bad he didn't keep that stuff up. The two of us working together like that would have been able to take on any Angel, no problem._  
她回想起当时抬头看到真嗣在初号机里紧抓着她的零号机，两人一同被提升至安全地带时的那种释然与喜悦。可惜他没能保持那种状态。我们俩要是能像那样并肩作战，任何使徒都不在话下。

The presence she had begun to feel was unignorable to her now, and she opened her eyes to see a puzzled look on the camera feed in front of her.  
现在，她已经无法忽视这种感觉了，她睁开眼睛，看到面前的摄像头画面上露出了一副困惑的表情。

"Activation attempt successful," Doctor Akagi said, one eyebrow quirked as she began frantically typing away at the keyboard in front of her. "36%. Not great, but not that bad. Much lower than your synch rate with Unit 02, and lower than the Third Child's, but truthfully I'm amazed you managed to synch at all. Everything feel normal, Asuka?"  
"激活尝试成功。"赤木律子博士说道，一边挑起一边眉毛，一边开始疯狂地在面前的键盘上敲打。"同步率 36%。不算太好，但也不算太糟。远低于你与零号机的同步率，也低于第三适格者的，但说实话，我很惊讶你居然能同步成功。感觉一切正常吗，明日香？"

She looked down at herself and gently moved her arms and legs, one at a time. _It feels different than when I synch with Unit 02. And not just because of the lower synch rate._ "I told you I would synch with the test type! Everything's great on my end," she crowed. She was still distracted by the feeling of _sharing the space_ that she was experiencing.  
"她低头看了看自己，轻轻地依次移动手臂和腿。感觉与同步零号机时不同。不仅仅是因为同步率较低。“我告诉过你会与试验机型同步的！我这边一切都很好，”她得意地说。她仍被这种共享空间的体验所吸引，心神不宁。”

_This is less like being one with the Eva and more like having the Eva's permission to ride in the front seat_, she thought. _Right_, she recalled, shaking her head slightly, _temperamental._  
"这不像与 Eva 融为一体，更像是得到了 Eva 的允许坐在前排座位上，她想。没错，她回想起，摇了摇头，真是喜怒无常。”

"Well, in that case, get yourself cleaned up and then get yourself up here. We've still got work to do," Akagi said as the LCL in the entry plug began to drain and Asuka's odd connection with Unit 01 disappeared.  
“好吧，既然如此，把自己收拾干净，然后上来。我们还有工作要做。”赤木律子说道，随着插入栓内的 LCL 开始排空，明日香与初号机之间的奇异联系也消失了。

Ω

Asuka sat at a terminal alongside some of her fellow NERV employees, paying half a mind to the text that scrolled down the screen in front of her. Ostensibly, she and her colleagues were monitoring the data feed for any problems while Doctor Akagi ran the system through a test. Her thoughts were elsewhere, however, and she was not alone in that mentality.  
明日香坐在终端前，与几位 NERV 的同事并肩，一半心思放在眼前屏幕上滚动的文本上。表面上，她和同事们正在监控数据流，以防出现任何问题，而赤木博士则在测试系统。然而，她的思绪却在别处，而且她并非唯一一个如此心不在焉的人。

Behind Asuka and the technicians at their computer stations, Misato was slouched in an office chair; her head was leaning back over the backrest and her arms dangling to the ground as she aimlessly spun in circles. Asuka was too focused to notice.  
在明日香和那些坐在电脑前的技术人员身后，美里懒洋洋地瘫坐在办公椅上；她的头靠在椅背上，双臂垂向地面，漫无目的地转着圈。明日香太过专注，并未注意到。

_It doesn't seem likely that Unit 01 behaves that way with the Third_, she thought, putting her elbow on her desk and propping her chin up with her hand. _As sloppy as he is, his performance doesn't indicate a handicap like that_, she begrudgingly admitted to herself. She'd been stewing on her experience of synching with Unit 01 since her encounter with it the previous day but had not been able to make any firm conclusions on the, as far as she could tell, irregular connection.  
零号机似乎不太可能以那种方式与三号机互动，她想道，将手肘支在桌上，用手托着下巴。尽管他表现得如此马虎，但他的表现并不像是有那样的障碍，她不情愿地暗自承认。自从前一天与零号机接触以来，她一直在琢磨与零号机的同步体验，但迄今为止还无法对这种，据她所知的，不规则连接做出任何明确的结论。

_It's kind of like Unit 01 didn't like me_. A minute frown crossed her face. _If that's the case, the feeling's mutual_. She sighed. _At least we can set aside our differences to fight the Angels?_  
感觉初号机好像不太喜欢我。她眉头微微一皱。如果真是这样，那我也一样。她叹了口气。至少我们可以暂时放下分歧，共同对抗使徒吧？

"I'm getting coffee!" Misato exclaimed, jumping up from her seat and stretching her arms above her head. "Anyone want some coffee?" A chorus of replies came from the operators around Asuka, but she ignored them.  
“我去冲咖啡！”美里大声宣布，从座位上跳起来，伸了个懒腰。“有人要咖啡吗？”周围的操作员们纷纷回应，但明日香置若罔闻。

_Who cares what that thing thinks anyway? It's no Unit 02, that's for sure. This is only a temporary measure until I get back to my_ real _home_.  
谁在乎那东西怎么想？它肯定比不上二号机。这只是暂时的措施，直到我回到真正的家。

"Thanks, Hyuga, but I can get it myself. I need to stretch my legs anyway. Asuka, coffee?" Misato asked, stepping up to the girl's seat and placing a hand on her shoulder.  
“谢谢，日向，不过我自己来就行。反正我也需要活动活动腿脚。明日香，要咖啡吗？”美里说着，走到女孩座位旁，将手搭在她肩上。

Asuka jolted slightly at the contact, quickly turning to face the captain. "Coffee? Sure," she said, waving her hand vaguely. _Ugh, just leave me alone, Misato!_  
明日香在接触中微微一震，迅速转身面对着队长。“咖啡？当然。”她含糊地挥了挥手。“唉，别管我了，美里！”

"Cream? Sugar?" Misato asked her, giving her shoulder a squeeze and grinning at her.  
“要加奶油和糖吗？”美里问她，轻轻捏了捏她的肩膀，朝她咧嘴一笑。

"You know," came the disembodied voice of Doctor Akagi from within the bowels of the computer system somewhere below them. "If you refrained from pestering the technicians while they're supposed to be working they'd be able to do their jobs better."  
“你知道，”从他们下方某处的计算机系统深处传来了赤木律子博士的声音，“如果你不在技术人员工作时打扰他们，他们能更好地完成任务。”

Misato's face scrunched up. "Quiet, you," she said. "Besides, don't act like I wasn't going to get you some too."  
美里皱起了脸。“安静，你，”她说，“再说了，别装得好像我不会给你也带一份似的。”

"I stand corrected," floated up the reply on a cigarette-scented draft.  
“我承认你说得对，”一个夹杂着烟味的气息中飘来了回应。

"That's what I thought," Misato said, smirking. "So, Asuka?"  
“我就知道，”美里得意地笑着说，“那么，明日香呢？”

"A little cream, and a lot of sugar," she replied, turning back to her monitor. _Don't these people know how to act like professionals? I swear, it's like I'm the only adult around here._  
“一点奶油，多放糖。”她回答道，转身回到显示器前。这些人难道不知道怎么表现得像个专业人士吗？我发誓，这里简直就像只有我一个成年人在场。

"You got it!" Misato cried. She released Asuka's shoulder and turned to leave but halted in her tracks when an alarm rang out through the facility.  
"你明白了！" 美里喊道。她松开明日香的肩膀，转身离开，却在警报声响彻设施时停下了脚步。

"It's an Angel!" Maya called out from her station as all of the computers switched over from the diagnostic program they had been running. Misato spun quickly back to face the large displays at the front of the operations center as maps and diagrams lit them up.  
"是使徒！" 真希波从她的位置上喊道，所有电脑都从正在运行的诊断程序切换过来。美里迅速转身面对作战中心前方的大屏幕，地图和图表点亮了屏幕。

"Asuka, get changed and make your way to the cages. We might need you," Misato snapped. "I want a location on the Angel—and get the nearest JSSDF and UN task forces on the net. What's the status on the defense grid? And the ETA for the other pilots?"  
"明日香，换好衣服去格纳库待命。我们可能需要你，" 美里厉声说道。"我要使徒的位置——并让最近的日本自卫队和联合国特遣部队上线。防御网状态如何？其他驾驶员的预计到达时间呢？"

Asuka was already out of her seat and sprinting towards the pilot's locker rooms before Misato had finished speaking, not paying attention to the rest of the exchange happening behind her. _As if you needed to tell me! Finally, I've been waiting for this!_  
明日香在 Misato 还没说完话之前就已经离开座位，朝着飞行员更衣室飞奔而去，完全没留意身后其余的对话。好像还需要你告诉我似的！终于，我等这一刻等了好久了！

She was able to quickly make her way to the locker room, thanks to the alarm clearing the halls, and even more quickly changed into her plugsuit. _If they've got any sense, they'll launch me in Unit 01 straight away_, she thought almost frantically, running towards the Eva cages.  
得益于警报清空了走廊，她迅速赶到了更衣室，并更快地换上了插入栓服。如果他们还有点理智，就会立刻让我驾驶零一出发，她几乎狂乱地想着，朝着 EVA 格纳库跑去。

As she approached the door to the cages and made her way inside, she could hear the chatter from the operations center as it was piped into the cavernous room over an intercom.  
当她走近格纳库的门并进入内部时，通过扩音器，她能听到从指挥中心传来的嘈杂声，回荡在这个巨大的空间里。

"Is it just holding position? Why would it do that?" She could hear one of the technicians, who she recalled had introduced himself as Shigeru Aoba.  
"只是保持位置吗？它为何会这么做？" 她能听到其中一个技术员的声音，她记得他自我介绍过，名叫青木茂。

"Do the Magi have an assessment?" Misato asked.  
"三贤者有进行评估吗？"美里问道。

"Standby," Akagi responded.

"Right," Misato said. "Has the city finished entering its defensive posture? And I'm still waiting on the status of the pilots."  
“好的，”美里说道，“城市是否已经完成了防御姿态的部署？我还在等待驾驶员们的状态报告。”

_This is all pointless!_ Asuka grumbled to herself. She had her arms crossed and was impatiently tapping her foot next to the gangway leading to Unit 01's entry plug, leaning against a console with a speaker and a set of controls for the hoist system that lowered the plug into the Eva. _Just let me at the thing, I'll have it taken care of before Misato can finish her coffee run._
_这一切都毫无意义！_ 明日香自言自语地抱怨着。她双臂交叉，不耐烦地在零号机插入栓的舷梯旁跺着脚，身体斜靠在一个控制台上，上面有一个扬声器和一套用于起重系统的控制装置，可以将插入栓降入EVA中。_让我来对付那东西，我能在美里喝完咖啡之前搞定它。_

"All buildings fully retracted," Hyuga Makoto said. "First and Third Children en route to the Geofront now, ETA eight minutes."
"所有建筑已完全收回，" 日向诚说道，"第一和第三适格者正在前往地底都市，预计八分钟后到达。"

"Second Child on standby, right next to Unit 01," Asuka prodded, holding down the transmission button next to the speaker so she could be heard in the operations center.  
"二号机待命，就在零号机旁边。" 明日香按住通话按钮，以便她的声音能在指挥中心被听到。

"Continue standing by, Asuka," Misato said. "We're still assessing the situation."  
"继续待命，明日香，"美里说道，"我们还在评估局势。"

Asuka _hmph_ed. _By the time you finish "assessing" things, I could finish off that Angel._ She eyed the controls to lower the entry plug, but shook her head. _They'd put me on lockdown as soon as I got out of the Eva._  
明日香哼了一声。等你们"评估"完，我早就能解决那只使徒了。她瞥了一眼放下插入栓的控制器，但还是摇了摇头。我一从 EVA 里出来，他们就会把我锁起来。

"Magi are tracking a NERV flight heading into Tokyo-III. The Angel's position is directly in its path. They estimate an 89% chance that the Angel intends to intercept the flight," Akagi said.  
"MAGI 正在追踪一架飞往第三新东京市的 NERV 航班。使徒的位置正好在其航线上。他们估计使徒有 89%的可能会拦截这架航班，"赤木律子说道。"

"What the hell?" Misato yelled. "Contact that aircraft, tell them to find somewhere else to be! What in the world would the Angel want with them, anyway?"

"The Magi haven't determined that," the doctor answered. "But the positioning is too exact for them to consider another hypothesis as more likely."  
“梅吉们尚未得出结论，”医生答道，“但位置的精确度使得他们难以认为其他假设更有可能。”

"The flight isn't responding to comms," Shigeru called out.  
“飞行器没有回应通讯，” 白根喊道。

"Could the Angel's AT field be interfering with the signal? It's directly between us and the flight," Maya said.  
“可能是天使的 AT 力场干扰了信号？它正好在我们和飞行器之间，” 真希波说。

"That's likely the case, and the Magi agree. Intentionally or not, the Angel is blocking transmissions between us and them," Akagi concurred.  
“很可能是这样，而且 MAGI 也这么认为。无论有意无意，天使正在阻断我们与他们之间的通讯，” 赤木律子同意道。

"Or someone is just asleep at the radio," Misato said bitterly. "Either way, I'm not letting that thing have its toy. How soon can we get Unit 01 out there?"  
"或者是有人在电台前睡着了，" 美里苦涩地说道，"不管怎样，我绝不会让那东西得到它的玩具。我们多久能把初号机送出去？"

"We can get Unit 01 rigged to one of the QRF transports and in the air in ten minutes, then it's five more to airlift it to the target," Hyuga said. "We only have one weapons station that far out, but there's plenty of connectors for the umbilical to plug into," he added.

Asuka sighed. _I won't be able to take any of the big guns with me in the transport. Hopefully they can send some out there while I'm in transit. I like a good scrap as much as the next girl, but a woman has to accessorize, after all._  
明日香叹了口气。在运输过程中我无法携带任何重型武器。希望在我运输途中他们能派一些过去。我喜欢打架，不亚于其他女孩，但毕竟，女人总得打扮一下。

"Call it 20 minutes in total, then, since we're still waiting for Shinji to arrive," Misato said.  
"那就总共 20 分钟吧，因为我们还在等真嗣到达，" 美里说。"

_What?! I'm RIGHT HERE!_ Asuka fumed, her face darkening as she scowled. _What the hell is wrong with you?! You don't need him when you've got the best literally standing at the gates ready to go!_ "Misato," she said as calmly as she could into the intercom, "I'm—"  
什么？！我就在这儿！明日香怒火中烧，脸色阴沉地皱起眉头。你到底怎么了？！有我这个顶尖高手就在门口随时待命，你还用得着他吗？“美里，”她尽可能平静地对着对讲机说，“我——”

"How long until the flight reaches the Angel?" Misato continued over Asuka's transmission. The pilot's scowl deepened, but she refrained from the scathing diatribe she so wanted to be giving. _Stay professional, Asuka. Don't give them a reason to cart you off to that school and away from Unit 02. When it finally gets here, anyway._  
"距离航班抵达天使还有多久？" 美里在明日香的通讯中继续问道。飞行员皱眉加深，但她忍住了想要痛斥的冲动。保持专业，明日香。别给他们借口把你送到那所学校，远离 02 号机。反正它最终会来的。

"26 minutes," Shigeru answered.  
"26 分钟，" 四郎回答道。

"Damn, that's cutting it close," Misato grumbled. "We'll just have to deal with it. Tell whoever's driving the pilots here to step on it and get Shinji into Unit 01 ASAP."  
"该死，时间紧迫，" 美里咕哝道。"我们只能这样了。告诉驾驶人员加快速度，尽快把真嗣送到 01 号机上去。"

"The Second Child will pilot Unit 01," came the Commander's voice over the intercom.  
"二号机将由二号驾驶员驾驶，" 指挥官的声音通过对讲机传来。"

_Yes!_ Asuka cheered, a tight grin replacing her scowl. _Not the first person that I thought would see reason on this issue, but at least it's something. Misato and her precious Shin-chan were going to screw everything up._  
太好了！明日香欢呼道，紧绷的嘴角取代了之前的皱眉。虽然不是第一个想到会在这件事上讲道理的人，但至少是个进展。美里和她那宝贝的真嗣差点就把一切都搞砸了。

"Sir?" Misato asked. "The Third Child has a higher synch rate with Unit 01, we should—"  
“长官？”美里问道，“第三适格者与初号机的同步率更高，我们应该——”

"Irrelevant," the Commander interrupted. "I'm confident that the Second Child's training will be adequate to make up the difference. Pilot Soryu?"  
"无关紧要，"指挥官打断道，"我相信二号机的训练足以弥补这一差距。Soryu 驾驶员？"

_Oh, I'll show you_ adequate_, you old bastard._ "Yes, Commander?" She said instead.  
哦，我会让你见识到什么叫足够的，你这个老混蛋。"是的，指挥官？"她改口道。

"I understand you've tested with Unit 01. Are you assured that you can pilot it effectively in combat?" His tone offered no quarter for a negative response, but Asuka was not about to give him one.  
"我听说你已经与零一机进行了测试。你确信能在实战中有效驾驶它吗？"他的语气不容许任何负面回应，但明日香绝不会给他这样的机会。

"Absolutely, sir," she ensured. _I'll show them what a real pilot can do. A debut battle, with no Third Child to get in my way!_

"You have your pilot, Captain," the Commander said with finality.  
“你有你的飞行员，上尉，”指挥官以不容置疑的口吻说道。

"Yes, sir," Misato replied, just a touch of resignation in her tone. "Asuka, you heard him. Get into the plug and get ready to launch."  
"是的，长官，" 美里回答道，语气中略带一丝无奈。"明日香，你听到了。进入插入栓，准备发射。"

"On it!" Asuka called before running the last few meters to the entry plug. It was already swarming with engineers and technicians that had been waiting in the wings for the final launch prep work.  
"明白！" 明日香应声后，快步跑完最后几米到达插入栓。那里早已聚集了工程师和技术人员，他们一直在待命，等待着最后的发射准备工作。

As she was settling into her seat the entry plug was already being lowered into Unit 01. _Back into the Eva. For real, this time._ LCL began filling the plug once it was secured inside the Eva, with Asuka taking her first lungful as it rose over her head. She smiled contentedly. _Even if it's a poor substitute for my Unit 02, it's still an Eva, and I'm an Eva pilot—master of my domain._  
当她安顿在自己的座位上时，插入栓已经开始降入初号机。再次进入 EVA。这次是真的。插入栓在 EVA 内固定好后，LCL 开始注入，随着液体升过头顶，明日香深吸了一口。她满足地笑了。即便这只是二号机的拙劣替代品，但它依然是 EVA，而我是一名 EVA 驾驶员——我领域的掌控者。

"Initializing contact, are you ready, Asuka?" Maya asked over the comm.  
"正在建立联系，准备好了吗，明日香？"真希波通过通讯问道。

"Let's get the show started," she answered readily. She once again began her faux breathing as she cleared her mind, stuffing her uncertainty about being able to synch with Unit 01 again, as well as how the fight might go, into the deepest pit she could. _Hi, it's me again,_ she thought at the Eva, trying to bridge between them. _Asuka Langley Soryu? Remember?_  
“让我们开始吧，”她爽快地回答。她再次开始假装呼吸，清空思绪，将能否再次与 01 号机同步的疑虑，以及战斗可能的走向，统统压入心底最深处。嗨，又是我，她在心中对 Eva 说道，试图搭建起彼此间的联系。惣流·明日香·兰格雷？还记得吗？

The odd _together_ sensation she expected did not manifest. _We don't really have time for this, you know._  
她预期的那种奇异融合感并未出现。你知道的，我们真的没时间搞这个。

"Asuka? Is something wrong?" Misato's voice called out.  
“明日香？有什么不对劲吗？”美里喊道。

Asuka kept her eyes closed and continued to focus mostly on being as receptive to Unit 01's fickle graces as she could. "No, just give me a second," she ground out.  
明日香闭着眼睛，继续尽可能地专注于接受零一机甲那反复无常的恩赐。“没事，就给我一点时间，”她咬牙说道。

_Give me a break, here, we've got a combat situation on our hands. I've got to do this, or they'll stick the Third in here_, she thought. _It's the duty of the elite to protect others, after all, and I suppose others includes him too. Could you imagine the mess he would make of this fight? I mean, you were there for the last one, obviously. Do you want a repeat of that?_ Once again, she began to feel as if there were someone inside the plug with her, like the Eva was keeping her at arm's length.  
饶了我吧，眼下可是战斗状态。我必须这么做，否则他们会把三号机塞进来，她心想。毕竟，精英的职责就是保护他人，我想这也包括他在内。你能想象他在这场战斗中会搞出多大的乱子吗？我是说，上次那场战斗你也在场，显然。你希望重蹈覆辙吗？又一次，她开始感觉仿佛有人与她同在插入栓内，仿佛 Eva 正与她保持距离。

_Glad that we're in agreement, whoever or whatever you are._ She grinned. _You excited for the fight too? I don't think we'll need any of that berserker business, but let's keep it in the back pocket just in case, ok?_  
很高兴我们达成了一致，无论你是谁。她咧嘴一笑。你也对这场战斗感到兴奋吗？我觉得我们不需要那种狂战士的战术，但先留着以防万一，好吗？

"Activation successful. Ma'am?" Maya said.  
“激活成功，女士？”玛雅说道。

"Eva Unit 01, launch!" Misato declared, and Asuka felt the sensation of shooting up through the launch chute—slightly diminished by her lower synch rate with Unit 01 than she was used to in her own Eva.  
“零号机，发射！”美里宣布道，而明日香感受到了从发射通道中急速上升的感觉——尽管与零号机的同步率不如她习惯的自己的 EVA 那么高。

Ω

"You've reached the drop-point, Asuka, get ready for a hot landing," Misato told the pilot. "That flight will be passing overhead in a little over ten minutes, so we're going to have to make this quick. I have no idea how the Angel plans to engage it, but that doesn't matter because you're stopping it before it gets the chance."  
"你已经到达投放点，明日香，准备迎接一次热烈的着陆。"美里对飞行员说道，"那架飞行器将在十多分钟后从上方经过，所以我们得抓紧时间。我不知道使徒打算如何攻击它，但这无关紧要，因为你会在它有机会之前阻止它。"

"Right," Asuka said, flashing a grin at the camera feed. "I'm ready to go." _Just make sure you're all ready to take in the sight of my glorious victory!_ She could feel Unit 01 react to her gloating—not reciprocating her elation and pride as she recalled Unit 02 would do when she had strong emotions while synched with it, but more like the Eva was curious about her, in a _who is this strange girl_ kind of way.  
“好嘞，”明日香对着摄像头露出一个得意的笑容，“我准备好了。”你们可得准备好迎接我辉煌的胜利啊！她能感觉到零一机对她这番得意洋洋的反应——不像她记忆中零二机在她同步时情绪高涨会回应她的喜悦和自豪，零一机更像是对她感到好奇，带着一种“这个奇怪的女孩是谁”的意味。

_It feels like somebody giving me a weird look. Cut it out, we just need to kill this Angel, ok?_ The feeling mostly subsided, and Asuka heard the sound of the travel locks disengaging from Unit 01, followed by the sensation of falling. The pilot grinned.  
感觉像是有人在用奇怪的眼神看我。别闹了，我们只需要干掉这只使徒，好吗？那种感觉大多消退了，随后明日香听到了零号机解除旅行锁定的声音，紧接着是下坠的感觉。驾驶员咧嘴一笑。

She tucked Unit 01's arms into its chest and kept its feet and knees together as they fell, making contact with the ground with the balls of Unit 01's feet and twisting the energy of the fall into a roll that saw them standing right next to the weapons tower and one of the umbilical stations. She immediately reached for a cord and plugged it into its receptacle on Unit 01's back, the annoying countdown timer that had been flashing in the corner of her vision blanking out in response.  
她将零一式的双臂收拢于胸前，保持其双脚与膝盖并拢，在下坠过程中以脚掌着地，顺势将坠落的能量转化为翻滚，最终稳稳地停在了武器塔和其中一个脐带站旁。她迅速伸手抓住一根电缆，插入零一式背后的接口，视野角落里令人烦躁的倒计时随即消失无踪。

Surveying the battlefield, Asuka noted the Angel's position while she took in the lay of the land. They were just beyond the outskirts of Tokyo-III, with the only hints at civilization being the weapons station she was currently standing at, the occasional umbilical building every few thousand meters, and power lines leading to and from the city. Most of the terrain was flat and grassy, though there were some hills with forests crowning them to her west.

With the terrain accounted for, Asuka looked out toward her reason for being there. The Angel was a weirdly shaped dark purple tube with rigid protuberances at the apex of the tube that resembled a caricature of shoulders. It had a—well, mushroom-shaped lighter colored blob above its supposed shoulders that Asuka took for its head. A small label at the very periphery of her vision informed her that the Magi had designated it as Shamshel. It wasn't facing her; instead, its attention seemed to be focused away from Tokyo-III.  
考虑到地形因素，明日香将目光投向了她此行的目的。眼前的使徒形似一个怪异的深紫色圆筒，顶部生有坚硬的突起，宛如肩部的夸张漫画。在其所谓的肩膀上方，有一个蘑菇状的浅色斑块，明日香猜测那便是它的头部。视野边缘的小标签提示她，MAGI 系统将其命名为“萨姆沙尔”。它并未面向她，而是似乎将注意力集中在远离第三新东京市的地方。

_Probably looking for that plane. Well, whatever this disgusting looking freak wants with that dumb thing, it's made the first of a series of grave mistakes: turning its back while the Great Asuka Langley Soryu, Eva pilot extraordinaire, is on the field of battle!_ She again got the feeling of Unit 01 seemingly quirking a metaphorical eyebrow at her, but it was tempered with a sense of purpose. _Come on, Unit 01. Let's do this._  
可能是在找那架飞机。管这个恶心怪物想拿那蠢东西做什么，它已经犯下了一连串严重错误中的第一个：在伟大的明日香·兰格雷，超凡的 EVA 驾驶员在场的情况下背过身去！她再次感觉到初号机似乎在用隐喻的眉毛挑衅她，但这种感觉被一种使命感所调和。来吧，初号机。让我们行动起来。

"There are rifles in the weapon station," Misato informed her, which dragged Asuka's gaze back to her camera feed. "That's all for now, but they're working on sending some other stuff as we speak."  
“武器站里有步枪，”美里告诉她，这让明日香的目光重新回到摄像机画面上。“目前只有这些，但他们正在努力发送其他装备。”

"That's disappointing," Asuka pouted. _I wanted to try out one of those axes I used to train with in Berlin!_ Suddenly, she noticed that the operations center had picked up some new occupants during her flight: standing behind Misato, she could see both the First and Third Children in their plugsuits, the First being heavily wrapped with bandages. The Third, meanwhile, had an ugly red splotch on his cheek, just under his eye, that looked like it would turn into a nasty bruise soon.  
“真令人失望，”明日香噘嘴道。我想试试在柏林训练时用的那些斧头！突然，她注意到在她飞行期间，指挥中心多了些新面孔：站在美里身后，她可以看到第一和第三适格者穿着插入栓服，第一适格者身上缠满了绷带。而第三适格者脸颊上，就在眼睛下方，有一块难看的红斑，看起来很快就会变成严重的淤青。

_What trouble did you get into, Idiot? And wow, whatever happened did a number on the First,_ she thought, though her feelings for the girl were mixed, trending towards negative. _She probably just sat there and took it because no one ordered her to not get hurt._ She shook her head.  
你又惹了什么麻烦，傻瓜？而且哇，不管发生了什么，对一号的打击可不小，她想，尽管她对这女孩的感情复杂，偏向负面。她大概只是坐在那儿默默承受，因为没人命令她不要受伤。她摇了摇头。

"Hey, Shinji, First, make sure you pay attention to this fight!" She called out to her fellow pilots. "I'm going to show you how a _real_ Eva pilot defeats Angels!" Predictably, the First Child did not react at all to Asuka's proclamation, but the Third did give her a grin and a small wave. _Good,_ she thought, returning the Third's grin, _keep your eyes on me, Shinji_.  
"嘿，真嗣，首先，你得好好看着这场战斗！" 她向其他驾驶员喊道，"我要让你们见识一下，真正的 Eva 驾驶员是如何击败使徒的！" 不出所料，第一适格者对明日香的宣言毫无反应，但第三适格者却向她露出了笑容，并轻轻挥了挥手。很好，她心想，回以第三适格者一个微笑，真嗣，把目光投向我吧。

"Don't get cocky, Asuka. Just take this carefully. Start off at range and move in for CQB if you need to."  
"别得意忘形，明日香。小心行事。先从远处开始，必要时再靠近进行近战。"

"Fine, Misato," she griped as she had Unit 01 grab two of the six rifles that were in the weapons rack inside the tower. She directed Unit 01 to a kneeling position and had it take aim at the Angel, judging the distance to be about 1200 meters away, and open fire.  
"好吧，美里，"她抱怨着，让零号机从塔内的武器架上抓起六支步枪中的两支。她指挥零号机采取跪姿，瞄准天使，判断距离约为 1200 米，随即开火。

As expected, the hail of bullets stopped just short of the Angel.  
正如预期，弹雨在接近天使之前便停了下来。

"You're going to have to get in closer to weaken its AT field!" Misato said over the radio.  
"你必须靠近些来削弱它的 AT 力场！" 美里通过无线电喊道。

"I know," Asuka growled, having Unit 01 scoop up the remaining rifles and run closer to the Angel. They quickly closed the distance with their foe, coming to within a few hundred meters of it, and Asuka could feel Unit 01's AT field eroding the Angel's. _Hah! You're no match for me, you gross-looking creep!_ She once again had Unit 01 bring two rifles to bear on their target and open fire, but just as the first rounds were leaving the barrels slim neon purple cords slipped out of the Angel's shoulders and sliced through the rifles Unit 01 was holding.  
"我知道，" 明日香咆哮着，让 01 号机捡起剩余的步枪并跑向使徒。他们迅速缩短了与敌人的距离，接近到几百米之内，明日香能感觉到 01 号机的 AT 力场正在侵蚀使徒的。哈！你不是我的对手，你这丑陋的怪物！她再次让 01 号机举起两支步枪对准目标并开火，但就在第一轮子弹射出枪管时，几根细长的霓虹紫色触手从使徒的肩膀伸出，切断了 01 号机手中的步枪。

After they had carved through her weapons, the cords came back down to lash against Unit 01's chest and arms, leaving deep welts in the armor where they impacted. Asuka felt the burning sensation that Unit 01 was experiencing, but only faintly. _There's one thing to be thankful for when it comes to low synch rates, I guess,_ she thought as she had Unit 01 dive and dodge away from the Angel's whip-like appendages.  
在他们将她的武器一一击破后，那些绳索再次降下，猛烈抽打在 01 号机胸前和双臂上，在装甲上留下深深的鞭痕。明日香能隐约感受到 01 号机所承受的灼痛。低同步率倒也有一点好处，她边想边操控 01 号机俯冲闪避，躲开使徒那鞭子般的触手。

She kept the Eva constantly moving, weaving back and forth in front of the Angel, but it was still managing to connect with strikes more often than Asuka was comfortable with. _I've got to change things up,_ she thought frantically. _I'm being careful not to expose my back, but eventually that thing's going to get lucky and slice through my umbilical. Let me try something—_  
她让 Eva 持续移动，在使徒面前来回穿梭，但对方仍能比她所愿更频繁地击中她。我得改变策略，她慌乱地想。我小心翼翼不露出破绽，但那东西迟早会走运，切断我的脐带电缆。让我试试别的——

Inspired, she deliberately had Unit 01 overextend an arm on its next dodge, making for a perfectly exposed target for the Angel to strike. It took the bait, one of the bright cords lashing down towards Unit 01's wrist. Asuka, however, had Unit 01 stop in place, twist its arm up, and grab onto the weapon instead, wrapping it around the Eva's fist like it was coiling in a rope. This had the unfortunate side-effect of burning the Eva's hand, so intensely that it was quite painful even for the pilot.  
灵感突现，她故意让初号机在下一次闪避时过度伸展手臂，制造出一个完美的暴露目标，诱使使徒发起攻击。使徒果然上钩，一条明亮的触手猛地抽向初号机的手腕。然而，明日香却让初号机停下脚步，扭转手臂，反而抓住了这根武器，将其像缠绕绳索一样缠绕在 EVA 的拳头上。不幸的是，这导致 EVA 的手掌被严重烧伤，即使对于驾驶员来说，这种疼痛也相当剧烈。

_Just bear with me, Unit 01,_ she thought to the Eva. _This is going to be painful, but I know it'll work!_ As she continued to have Unit 01 coil up one of the cords with one hand, the Angel was using its other whip to strike at the Eva's arm in an attempt to free itself from the titan's grasp. She could hear voices yelling over the radio, but she paid them no mind.  
忍耐一下，初号机，她在心中对 EVA 说道。这会很痛苦，但我知道这会奏效的！当她继续让初号机用一只手缠绕其中一根触手时，使徒正用另一条鞭子猛击 EVA 的手臂，试图挣脱巨人的掌控。她能听到无线电里传来的喊声，但她置若罔闻。

Asuka smirked through the pain, watching and waiting for the perfect moment, before having Unit 01 snatch the cord with its free hand, stuffing it into the fist that was already controlling the other weapon once it was securely in the Eva's grasp. The armor on Unit 01's arms, shoulders, and hands was now completely ruined, in some parts covered in deep gashes that exposed flesh and in other parts completely burned off. The Eva continued to coil the Angel's whips around its fist, its brute strength overpowering the Angel's desperate attempts to free itself.  
明日香强忍疼痛，嘴角勾起一抹冷笑，静观其变，等待最佳时机。随后，零一机用空闲的那只手迅速夺过缆绳，将其塞入早已操控另一武器的拳头中，一旦缆绳稳稳落入 EVA 的掌控。零一机的手臂、肩部和手部的装甲此刻已彻底损毁，部分区域布满深可见肉的裂口，其他部分则被完全烧蚀。EVA 继续将使徒的鞭子缠绕在拳头上，其蛮力压倒了使徒拼命挣扎的企图。

"Almost—there," Asuka panted, sweating with exertion and pain but still smirking. _Are you all still watching? You'd better be paying attention, Idiot!_ Now that she was closer to the Angel, and no longer jumping around like a madwoman to avoid its attacks, she easily spotted the beast's core: in an aperture directly between the shoulders and at the base of the head. "Gotcha!"  
“差——不多——到了，”明日香喘着气，汗水混杂着努力与疼痛，但嘴角依旧挂着微笑。你们还在看吗？最好给我认真点，笨蛋！现在她离使徒更近了，不再像疯女人一样四处跳跃躲避攻击，她轻易地发现了那怪物的核心：就在肩部正中，头部基底的位置。“抓到你了！”

With the threat of the whips neutralized, and Unit 01's AT field overpowering the Angel's, Asuka had Unit 01 grab up a rifle from the ground with its free hand and fire directly into the Angel's core. As the first rounds began to impact the glossy red surface of the core, the Angel's struggle against Unit 01 seemed to double as it released terrible screeches that reverberated in the pilot's skull. Unit 01, however, maintained a sure grip on its prize and a steady aim on its target.  
随着鞭子的威胁被消除，零一机体的 AT 力场压倒了使徒的，明日香操控零一机体用空着的手从地上抓起一把步枪，直接向使徒的核心射击。当第一批子弹开始撞击核心那光滑的红色表面时，使徒对抗零一机体的挣扎似乎加剧了，它发出了可怕的尖叫声，回荡在驾驶员的脑海中。然而，零一机体稳稳地抓住了猎物，瞄准目标的手也丝毫不抖。

More rounds impacted the core, with one rifle being discarded and another picked up, before the surface finally cracked and the luscious light it gave off dimmed. The Angel collapsed and Unit 01, having been braced against the thrashing angel, almost fell over before Asuka corrected its balance. She had Unit 01 release the whips it had wrapped around its fist and surveyed her apparently defeated foe.  
更多的子弹击中核心，一支步枪被丢弃，另一支随即拾起，直到表面终于裂开，那诱人的光芒也黯淡下来。天使倒下，初号机在抵挡着天使的挣扎中险些倾覆，幸亏明日香及时调整平衡。她让初号机松开缠绕在拳头上的鞭子，审视着眼前看似已被击败的敌人。

"You did it, Asuka! Fantastic!" Misato cheered over the radio.  
“你做到了，明日香！太棒了！”美里在无线电中欢呼道。

_That was kind of anticlimactic. Well, a victory's a victory! The Great Asuka Langley Soryu triumphs on the field, and the people rejoice. I don't want to hear it, Unit 01_, she preemptively scolded the whatever-it-was she felt when she was in the plug. _I won; I get to gloat. You should try it some time._ Rather than the skepticism she was expecting, she was met with a feeling of smug amusement. _Right. Well, we won, I guess. Good job, test type._  
那有点虎头蛇尾。不过，胜利就是胜利！伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷在战场上大获全胜，人们欢呼雀跃。我不想听，初号机，她抢先斥责了那种在插入栓里感受到的莫名情绪。我赢了；我有权得意。你该试试的。她本以为会遭到怀疑，却意外地感受到了一种自得的愉悦。好吧。我们赢了，我想。干得好，试验机型。

"That's right!" Asuka preened, turning her attention to her camera feed, and taking in her well-deserved praise. "Now everyone's seen how to _really_ deal with an Angel!"  
“没错！”明日香得意地转向摄像头，接受她应得的赞扬，“现在大家都看到了如何真正对付使徒！”

"Well, you certainly accomplished something out there," Doctor Akagi said acerbically. "We're going to have to replace pretty much all of the armor on Unit 01 from the chest up, and it'll take days to regenerate those hands!"  
“好吧，你确实在那里做了些什么，”赤木律子博士尖刻地说，“我们得更换初号机胸部以上的几乎所有装甲，而且需要几天时间才能再生那些手！”

"Oh, calm down, Rits," Misato chided her, rolling her eyes and crossing her arms. "That's a drop in the bucket when it comes to Eva maintenance. Besides, look at the giant Angel corpse she got for you. Don't you sciencey types get all hot and bothered about that kind of stuff?"  
"哦，冷静点，律子，" 美里责备她，翻了个白眼，双臂交叉。"对于 EVA 的维护来说，这只是九牛一毛。再说了，看看她给你弄来的巨大使徒尸体。你们这些搞科研的不就对这种东西特别兴奋吗？"

Akagi chuckled. "Well, I suppose every cloud has a silver lining."  
赤木轻笑道："嗯，我想每朵乌云都有一线光明。"

While the two friends had been talking, Asuka had noticed a particular lack of a presence in the operations center. "Where'd the Third get to? If he didn't watch me fight that thing, I'll make him regret it!" _Idiot, what do you think you're doing? How are you going to learn to fight if you don't watch me do it?_  
在两位朋友交谈之际，明日香察觉到指挥中心内似乎少了某个人的存在。“三号去哪儿了？要是他没看我打那东西，我非让他后悔不可！”笨蛋，你以为自己在干嘛？不看着我打，你怎么学得会战斗？

Misato glanced around, but saw only her friend, the other technicians, and the First Child. "He must have gone down to get changed. Don't worry, Asuka, I'm sure he saw the whole thing. Anyway, everyone, commence recovery operations. And someone get that flight on comms; I'm going to personally explain exactly how stupid everyone on that plane is to every single one of them."  
美里环顾四周，只看到她的朋友、其他技术人员和第一适格者。“他一定是下楼去换衣服了。别担心，明日香，我敢肯定他全程都看到了。总之，各位，开始回收作业。还有谁去联系那架飞机，我要亲自向他们每个人解释他们有多愚蠢。”

### Chapter 6

Ως αεί τον όμοιον άγει θεός ως τον όμοιον (As always, god brings like and like together) — Attributed to Homer, 8th century BCE  
神常将同类相聚，自古皆然（正如荷马所言，公元前 8 世纪）

The _clang_ of a locker door being shoved closed echoed around a mostly empty room, with the sole occupant grabbing a towel she had placed on the bench behind her before making her way towards an exit. _It's bad enough to have the phantom pain,_ Asuka thought to herself as she squeezed her free hand opened and closed, _but they seriously can't expect me to wear bandages!_  
储物柜门砰然关闭的响声在空荡荡的房间里回荡，唯一的居住者抓起她之前放在长凳后面的毛巾，向出口走去。‘幻痛已经够糟糕了，’明日香心想，同时用空着的手反复开合，‘但他们真的不能指望我缠着绷带！’

After her sortie with the Angel, Asuka had been recovered from Unit 01 and directed to shower and change before presenting herself for debriefing and medical examination. While the debriefing had been rescheduled, due to the operations director being otherwise occupied, Doctor Akagi had insisted on inspecting the pilot and applying bandages to her hands and arms after prodding the girl long enough to get her to admit to experiencing mild pain from her time in the Eva.  
在与使徒交战后，明日香从零一机中被救出，被指示先洗澡更衣，然后进行汇报和体检。虽然汇报因操作总监另有事务而改期，但赤木博士坚持要检查这位驾驶员，并在女孩被盘问到承认因驾驶 EVA 而感到轻微疼痛后，为她双手和双臂缠上了绷带。

Bandages that Asuka had removed as soon as she had made her way back down to the locker rooms, intent on relieving some pent-up stress that her surprisingly easy battle against the Angel hadn't managed to burn off. She had decided to return to the pool for her workout, since that was where she would have spent her evening anyway if the Angel had not attacked—first continuing her lessons with the Third Child, then getting her own training in.  
明日香一回到更衣室就立刻拆掉了绷带，她想释放一些积压的紧张情绪，尽管与天使的战斗出乎意料地轻松，却并未能完全消耗掉这些压力。她决定回到游泳池进行锻炼，因为如果没有天使的袭击，她原本的晚上计划就是在那里度过的——先是继续与第三适格者的课程，然后进行自己的训练。

As she pushed opened the door to the pool and made her way towards it, her eye caught onto a most unexpected sight: the self-same Third Child, still in his plugsuit, sitting at the edge of the shallow end of the pool, dangling his legs in the water. _What the hell is he doing here?_  
当她推开游泳池的门，走向泳池时，她的目光捕捉到了一个极为意外的景象：那位第三适格者，依然身着插入栓服，坐在浅水区边缘，双腿悬在水中。他到底在这里做什么？

She tossed her towel onto a chair she passed by as she walked up behind the other pilot. _Well, it looks like it's once again up to me to clean up the Third Child's mess. Why hasn't he noticed me yet? He can't serious—ah, those stupid headphones_, she thought, noticing the cords hanging from his ears. She couldn't hear the tinny sounds of whatever music he was listening to, but she recalled the mixtape he preferred to indulge in being mostly older pop songs with some classical blended in.  
她将毛巾扔到经过的一把椅子上，走到另一位驾驶员身后。看来，又是我来收拾第三适格者的烂摊子了。他怎么还没注意到我？他不可能——啊，那些愚蠢的耳机，她想着，注意到从他耳朵垂下的线缆。她听不见他正在听的任何音乐的微弱声音，但她记得他偏爱的混音带主要是一些老流行歌曲，夹杂着一些古典音乐。

"What the hell are you doing here, Third?" She said loudly, the boy in question jumping slightly at the sudden interruption. He quickly paused his music player and yanked the buds from his ears, turning to face Asuka with wide eyes.  
“你到底在这里干什么，第三？”她大声说道，那个男孩被突然的打断吓得微微一跳。他迅速暂停了音乐播放器，猛地拔出耳机，转过身来面对着明日香，眼睛睁得大大的。

"Come on, spit it out," Asuka pushed as Shinji remained silent. He placed his SDAT on the ground beside him, headphones neatly wrapped around the device, well away from the edge of the pool. "You shouldn't disappear from under people's noses like that, by the way," she added, looking down at him imperiously. "You better not have missed the end of my fight. Don't you think that _Misato-san_ will be worried sick when she realizes you've run off?" _Again?_  
"“快说，别吞吞吐吐的，”明日香催促道，而真嗣依然沉默不语。他把 SDAT 放在身边的地上，耳机整齐地缠绕在设备上，远离泳池边缘。“顺便说一句，你不应该这样突然消失在人们的视线中，”她傲慢地低头看着他说，“你最好没有错过我战斗的结尾。你不觉得当美里小姐发现你跑掉了会担心得要命吗？又来了？”

Shinji blushed in response and turned back to the water in front of him. "It's none of your business," he said quietly.  
真嗣脸一红，转回身面对眼前的水池。“这不关你的事，”他轻声说道。

_WHAT did you just say to me, Third Child?!_ She resisted the urge to kick him into the pool, choosing instead to cross her arms and stand menacingly close behind him. "The way I see it, _Third¸_ you have limited options. One: you answer my question and hope, _hope_, that I deem your answer good enough that I forgive your transgressions against me. Two: you keep up your shitty attitude, and I turn you over to Misato for her to lecture you on _responsibility_ and _respect_. And three: we get on with the workout we were going to skip due to the Angel fight today. We're both here at the pool, after all."  
你刚才对我说了什么，第三适格者？！她忍住了把他踢进泳池的冲动，选择交叉双臂，站在他身后咄咄逼人地靠近。“依我看，第三适格者，你的选择有限。一：你回答我的问题，并希望，希望，我认为你的回答足够好，让我原谅你对我的冒犯。二：你继续保持这种糟糕的态度，我就把你交给美里，让她来教训你关于责任和尊重的问题。三：我们继续进行原本因为今天的使徒战斗而打算跳过的训练。毕竟，我们都来到泳池了。”

Shinji hunched over himself in response. _Pool it is, then,_ Asuka thought as she raised one leg to shove the boy into the water.  
真嗣闻言缩成一团。那就泳池吧，明日香心想，随即抬起一条腿，准备把男孩推进水里。

Whether he sensed the intentions of the girl behind him or he came to a conclusion just in the nick of time, he very softly mumbled out a response before the girl could connect. "Ijustneededaplacetothink."  
不知是他察觉到了身后女孩的意图，还是在千钧一发之际得出了结论，他轻声咕哝了一句，赶在女孩开口之前。“我只是需要一个思考的地方。”

"What was that?" Asuka asked hotly, balancing on one leg with the other still poised in the air.  
“那是什么？”明日香热切地问道，一只脚平衡着身体，另一只脚仍悬在空中。

"I just needed a place to think," Shinji said more clearly, his shoulders dropping down as he unhunched himself and sighed deeply. "Not that anyone cares," he added quietly.  
“我只是需要一个思考的地方，”真嗣更清晰地说道，肩膀随着他挺直身体而放松下来，深深叹了口气。“反正也没人在乎，”他轻声补充道。

"Right," Asuka scoffed. She dropped her foot back to the ground. "So, you came to the pool because no one would think the Third Child, who only recently learned to swim, and I use the word swim loosely, would willingly come here?"  
"好吧，" 明日香嗤之以鼻。她将脚放回地面。"所以，你来游泳池是因为没人会想到，那个最近才学会游泳——我这里说的‘游泳’可是很宽松的定义——的第三适格者会自愿来这里？"

"Umm, well, yeah. I suppose," Shinji admitted. "When Misato-san asked me for the details about how you training me in the pool went I told her I'll never get used to swimming, and she wouldn't stop teasing me about being scared of water. I'm not scared of the water!" He insisted. "I'm just not comfortable with it."  
"嗯，呃，是的。我想是吧，" 真嗣承认道。"当美里小姐问我关于你在游泳池训练我的细节时，我告诉她我永远都不会习惯游泳，然后她就一直取笑我怕水。我不是怕水！" 他坚持说。"我只是不太适应。"

_Shinji, you idiot. You can't hide from NERV inside NERV. I learned that a long time ago._ Asuka walked up next to the boy and lowered herself to a seat beside him, also dangling her legs into the water. "Misato can be a bitch sometimes," she commiserated. She caught a slight blush once again make its way onto Shinji's face from the corner of her eye.  
真嗣，你这个笨蛋。你不能在 NERV 内部躲开 NERV。我很久以前就明白了。明日香走到男孩旁边，也坐下来，把腿悬在水中。"美里有时候真是个混蛋，" 她同情地说。她注意到真嗣的脸颊再次微微泛红。

"That's not really what I meant. She's just so childish—erm, not all the time," he corrected.  
"那并不是我的本意。她只是太孩子气了——呃，不是一直都这样，"他纠正道。

"No, for once, I think you're right, Third," Asuka said ponderously, ignoring the inquisitive look her gave her. _All of the adults here act like petty children—and they call us Children, while expecting us to do their dirty work! Then when I want to try to make some changes for the better around here, suddenly they all know so much better and they're all so much wiser than I could ever be. Hypocrites._ "But I don't think you came down here to reflect on Misato's immaturity." _You could easily do that hiding in your room like you used to do._  
"不，这一次，我觉得你说得对，三号，"明日香沉思着说，无视了他好奇的目光。这里的所有成年人表现得都像任性的小孩——他们称我们为孩子们，却指望我们去做他们的脏活！当我想要尝试为这里带来一些改善时，他们突然间都变得比我懂得多、比我明智得多。虚伪。"但我想你下来这里不是为了反思美里小姐的不成熟。"你完全可以像以前那样躲在房间里做这件事。

"Sorry, that's, um—" he trailed off with a mumble, his head sinking back down to his chest.  
"抱歉，那个，嗯——"他含糊其辞地停了下来，头又低垂到胸前。

_You want to get into the pool that badly, Idiot?_ Asuka raised an arm to reach towards Shinji, who's eyes widened at the motion. "I was thinking about piloting!" He rushed out, relief washing over his features as Asuka lowered her arm.  
你这么急着跳进泳池，傻瓜？明日香抬起手臂伸向真嗣，他的眼睛因这一动作而睁大。“我在想驾驶的事！”他急忙说道，随着明日香放下手臂，他的脸上流露出释然之色。

_Piloting, eh? Well, I suppose that's a decent topic to think about. I've been pretty focused on it myself for—a long time._ "Well?" Asuka prodded.
*驾驶，嗯？好吧，我想这是个不错的思考话题。我自己也一直很专注于这方面——已经很久了。*“那么？”明日香催促道。

"Well," he began heavily, his eyes turned to the pool's surface, "it's just that I don't know what I'm doing here." He started to bounce the heels of his feet off of the inside edge of the pool in a rhythmic manner.  
“唉，”他沉重地开口，目光转向池面，“只是我不明白自己为何会在这里。”他开始有节奏地用脚后跟敲击泳池内侧边缘。

Asuka let him sit in contemplation for a few moments, her aggravation and desire to push Shinji, figuratively and literally, kept in check by a growing, foreign, feeling: sympathy for the Third Child.  
明日香让他静坐沉思了片刻，她原本的恼怒和对真嗣的推搡冲动——无论是字面还是比喻上——都被一种逐渐升起的、陌生的情感所抑制：对第三适格者的同情。

"When I first came here, I told Father I wouldn't pilot the Eva. I didn't know anything about it, and he wanted me to fight that monster." He raised his right hand slightly, looking at his palm. "Then he had them bring in Ayanami to pilot instead—she was already injured, and covered in bandages, when the whole room shook. Debris fell from the ceiling, and Unit 01 somehow broke an arm free to protect me. But Ayanami fell off of her gurney," he clenched his hand into a fist and closed his eyes.  
当我初来乍到时，我曾告诉父亲我不会驾驶 EVA。我对它一无所知，而他却要我去对抗那怪物。他抬起右手，凝视着自己的手掌。“随后他让人把绫波带来替我驾驶——她当时已负伤，全身缠满绷带，就在整个房间震动的那一刻。天花板上的碎片纷纷落下，01 号机不知怎地挣断一条手臂来保护我。但绫波从担架上摔了下来，”他紧握拳头，闭上了双眼。

_I was running down the corridor to Momma's room, Papa had long ago stopped trying to keep up with me when we came to visit her. I was so excited to tell her that I had been chosen to pilot Unit 02—her Unit 02! She would have to love me again; she would have to be my Momma again!  
我沿着走廊奔向妈妈的房间，爸爸早已放弃在我们来访时试图跟上我的步伐。我兴奋地想要告诉她，我被选中驾驶二号机——她的二号机！她将不得不再次爱我；她将不得不再次成为我的妈妈！_

"When I went to help her up, she was even more injured than she had been already. I decided that I had to pilot because I couldn't let her get hurt even worse." He dropped his hand back down and dipped his fingers into the water, watching the ripples they made across the surface.  
当我上前扶她起身时，发现她伤得比之前更重了。我决定亲自驾驶，因为我不能让她再受更重的伤。他把手垂回水中，指尖轻触水面，看着涟漪在表面荡漾开来。

_When I opened the door, all I found was her body hanging from the ceiling and that horrible doll she called by my name hanging next to her. I don't know how long I stood there staring. Eventually Papa came in and called for the doctors and they took me away. I decided I would never need anyone ever again. I was a pilot from then on, that's all I would ever need.  
当我推开门时，只见她的身体悬挂在天花板上，旁边挂着那个她用我的名字称呼的可怕玩偶。我不知道自己站在那里凝视了多久。最终，爸爸进来了，呼叫了医生，他们把我带走了。我决定我再也不需要任何人了。从那时起，我成为了一名飞行员，这就是我所需要的一切。_

"But I managed to screw that up," Shinji said, his anger at himself breaking into his voice. "I found out that my fight went so badly that some poor little girl is hospitalized! She might never walk again, thanks to me getting into Unit 01."  
“但我还是搞砸了，”真嗣说道，对自己的愤怒在他的声音中爆发出来。“我发现我的战斗如此糟糕，以至于一个小女孩住进了医院！她可能再也无法走路了，这都是因为我进入了初号机。”

_Eventually, even my Unit 02 didn't want me, and NERV discarded me like I deserved. Piloting is my life, and I couldn't even do that right anymore._ "Is that where you got that bruise?" Asuka asked, her throat tight. She was making intense eye contact with the water in front of her, but she recalled the ugly mark on Shinji's face just under his left eye. As if he had been punched recently.  
最终，就连我的二号机也不再需要我，NERV 像我应得的那样抛弃了我。驾驶是我的生命，而我甚至不能再正确地做到这一点。“你脸上的淤青是在那里弄的吗？”明日香问道，她的喉咙发紧。她正专注地盯着面前的水，但她回想起真嗣左眼下方的那个丑陋痕迹。就好像他最近被人打了一拳。

The boy's hand rose to gently probe the spot and he winced slightly at the touch. "Her brother goes to my school. He's in my class, even. They all figured out that I was the pilot in that first battle, so when he came to class for the first time he knew who to target. I don't blame him," Shinji added. "It's my fault. I ruined his sister's life because I decided to pilot."  
男孩的手缓缓抬起，轻触那处伤痕，微微皱眉。“她哥哥和我同校，甚至同班。他们都知道我是那场首战的驾驶员，所以他第一次来上课时就知道该找谁算账。我不怪他，”真嗣补充道，“是我的错。我毁了他妹妹的生活，只因我决定驾驶 EVA。”

_I desperately tried to synch, in test after test, but in the end I wasn't even useful as cannon fodder against the 16__th_ _Angel. I just left after that._  
我拼命尝试同步，一次又一次测试，但最终连作为对抗第 16 使徒的炮灰都不够格。那之后我就离开了。

"And then you came along, and you were so eager to fight!" Shinji sighed. "I felt useless watching you pilot—all my piloting could do was hurt people. Did you know I wasn't even awake when the other Angel was defeated? It hurt so much that I blacked out. But when you were fighting earlier, you didn't panic at all—not like I did. Even though everyone was yelling about the damage you were taking and how you must have been in a lot of pain."  
“然后你出现了，如此急切地想要战斗！”真嗣叹息道，“看着你驾驶，我感到自己毫无用处——我的驾驶只会伤害他人。你知道吗，击败另一个使徒时我甚至都没醒着？痛到昏厥。而你之前战斗时，完全没有慌乱——不像我那样。尽管大家都在喊你承受的伤害和必然的剧痛。”

_I wandered the streets of Tokyo-III for a few days. The city was abandoned, but even if it hadn't been, I would have been alone anyway. No one has a use for a pilot that can't make her Eva move.  
我在东京-III 的街道上徘徊了几天。这座城市已被遗弃，但即便它未被遗弃，我依然会是孤身一人。没有人需要一个无法让她的 Eva 动起来的驾驶员。_

"So, if I don't pilot, people get hurt. And if I do pilot, people still get hurt." Shinji pressed on, encouraged by what he considered to be Asuka's thoughtful silence.  
“所以，如果我不驾驶，人们会受伤。而如果我驾驶，人们依然会受伤。”真嗣继续说道，他觉得明日香深思熟虑的沉默给了他鼓励。

_I hadn't had any food or water since even before I started roaming. Useless little girls don't deserve that stuff. Eventually I found a half-collapsed house with a bath still somehow working. I felt so dirty. I needed to clean myself.  
自从我开始流浪之前，我就没有吃过任何食物或水。没用的小女孩不配拥有这些东西。最终，我找到了一栋半塌的房子，里面竟然还有个浴缸奇迹般地能用。我感觉自己脏透了。我需要好好清洗自己。_

"But if you're here, you can pilot instead, and Father won't need me to do it. I don't have to be responsible for people getting hurt anymore."  
“但如果你在这里，你可以代替我驾驶，父亲就不再需要我来做这件事了。我再也不必为人们受伤负责了。”

"Then leave," Asuka said flatly. "If you don't want to be here, just go." _I folded my clothes and placed them neatly on the chair next to the bath. They were innocent and didn't deserve to be discarded so casually. Then I got into the tub and scrubbed my skin until it was red and raw. I still felt so dirty._  
“那就离开，”明日香冷冷地说，“如果你不想待在这里，就走吧。”我把衣服叠好，整齐地放在浴缸旁边的椅子上。它们是无辜的，不该被如此随意地丢弃。然后我进了浴缸，用力搓洗皮肤，直到它变得通红、粗糙。我仍然感觉自己脏透了。

"It's not that simple," Shinji muttered. "Father said that the Evangelion was my mother's work. I don't know if I can just abandon it. And what if something happens, and they need me to pilot again?"  
“没那么简单，”真嗣喃喃道，“父亲说过，EVA 是我母亲的作品。我不知道是否能就这样放弃它。万一出了什么事，他们又需要我再次驾驶怎么办？”

"You can't have your cake and eat it too, Shinji," Asuka told him, still mostly lost to her own thoughts. _The only option I had left was to die. I couldn't kill myself, not like—like Momma. But I could just—allow myself to die. Choose not to keep living. So that's what I did._  
“鱼与熊掌不可兼得，真嗣。”明日香对他说道，思绪仍大多沉浸在自己的世界里。我剩下的唯一选择就是死亡。我无法像——像妈妈那样自杀。但我可以——任由自己死去。选择不再继续活下去。所以我就是这么做的。

_But fuck that_. Asuka stood back up, yanking the Third Child up by the shoulder to stand next to her. _I decided when I ended up in this crazy shitshow that I would_ not _let the same mistakes slip by. I would make sure_ everything _would be done the right way. The Asuka Langley Soryu way._  
但去他妈的。明日香重新站起身，拽着第三适格者的肩膀让他站在自己身边。自从陷入这场疯狂的闹剧以来，我就下定决心不会再重蹈覆辙。我要确保一切都能正确无误地进行，以明日香·兰格雷的方式。

"You have to make a choice, Third. It sounds to me like you want to choose to keep piloting." She turned herself towards the boy and used her grip on his shoulder to make him face her. "It sucks that some kid got hurt because you piloted. How many more would have been hurt if you hadn't? It's useless to play the what-if game." Shinji did not meet her eyes, choosing instead to stare half-lidded at the floor.  
“你得做个选择，三号。在我听来，你似乎想继续驾驶。”她转向男孩，用手按住他的肩膀让他面对自己。“有孩子因为你驾驶而受伤，这很糟糕。但如果你没驾驶，又会有多少人受伤呢？纠结于假设毫无意义。”真嗣没有直视她，而是半眯着眼盯着地板。

"And just what the hell do you think I'm doing here, anyway?!" She shook the boy. "Sure, I can pilot your antiquated test type until my Unit 02 gets shipped in, but I did not put time and effort into designing a training plan just for you to whine about 'oh, I can't pilot, I don't know what I'm doing, people just get hurt.'"  
"你倒是说说看，我到底在这里干什么？！" 她摇晃着男孩。"没错，我可以驾驶你那过时的试验机型，直到我的二号机运来，但我可不是为了让你抱怨什么'哦，我开不了，我不知道自己在干什么，只会有人受伤'，才花时间和精力设计训练计划的。"

She released the boy and crossed her arms, turning her chin up and sneering at him. "That's bullshit! If anyone is at fault for those circumstances, its NERV, not you."  
她松开了男孩，双臂交叉，抬起下巴对他嗤之以鼻。“那简直是胡说八道！如果真有人该为那些情况负责，那也是 NERV，而不是你。”

Shinji's eyes rose to meet Asuka's, and he looked to be an odd combination of crestfallen at seemingly having his feelings on the matter dismissed out of hand, but slightly pleased that someone was taking him seriously enough to at least argue with him.  
真嗣的目光迎上了明日香的，他看起来既因自己的感受似乎被当场驳回而沮丧，又因有人足够认真地对待他，至少愿意与他争论而略感欣慰。

"Why do you pilot?" Asuka asked him.  
“你为什么要驾驶？”明日香问他。

"Umm—sorry, but I just answered that?" Shinji responded, confused.  
"呃——抱歉，但我刚刚不是回答了吗？" 真嗣回应道，感到困惑。

"I know what you just said. You said you're conflicted about piloting, but you don't want to leave. That doesn't answer the question," she said imperiously.  
"我知道你刚才说的。你说你对驾驶感到矛盾，但你不想离开。这并没有回答问题，" 她傲慢地说道。

"I, uh, I guess I'm still not sure. Sorry. That's kind of why I was down here, if you remember what I told you earlier," Shinji muttered the last part of his statement.  
"我，呃，我想我还是不太确定。对不起。这也是为什么我来到这里，如果你还记得我之前告诉你的话，" 真嗣低声说出了他陈述的最后一部分。

_Don't get brazen with me, Third!_ "If you don't know why you're piloting, then you aren't a pilot. You're an idiot teenager with a death wish," she informed him angrily. "You need to take this seriously, not half-ass it and expect others to pick up the slack. That's how you get into situations where yourself and others end up hurt or dead." _I can't even remember how many lectures I had in Berlin on how piloting isn't a game, and I need to fully commit to it. Who the hell did they think they were talking to?_  
别在我面前放肆，老三！“如果你不知道自己为何驾驶，那你就不算个飞行员，只是个找死的蠢少年，”她生气地告诉他。“你得认真对待这件事，不能半途而废还指望别人来收拾残局。那样只会让自己和他人陷入受伤或丧命的境地。”我在柏林听过多少次这样的训诫，说驾驶不是儿戏，我必须全身心投入。他们到底以为自己在跟谁说话？

Shinji seemed to take this seriously, pondering on it for a moment before giving Asuka a questioning look. "Why do _you_ pilot, Asuka?"  
真嗣似乎对此颇为认真，沉思片刻后向明日香投去探询的目光。“你为何要驾驶 EVA，明日香？”

_To fix this mess._ "Because I'm the best, obviously," she boasted. _Because I can't fail again._ "It would simply be a waste of my talents for me to do anything else." _To be close to Momma again._ "Besides, it's the duty of the elite, such as myself, to use our skills to protect others." _For revenge_. "In my case, that means piloting." _So that when I stand tall at the end of this fucking nightmare, no one can deny my accomplishments—they'll have to love me._  
要收拾这个烂摊子。“因为我显然是最棒的，”她自夸道。因为我不能再失败了。“做其他事简直就是浪费我的才华。”为了再次靠近妈妈。“而且，像我这样的精英，有责任运用我们的技能去保护他人。”为了复仇。“对我来说，这意味着驾驶。”这样当我在这该死的噩梦结束时站得笔直，没人能否认我的成就——他们将不得不爱我。

"Sorry. I guess I still need to find my reason," Shinji replied, eyeing Asuka thoughtfully.  
“对不起。我想我还需要找到我的理由，”真嗣回答，若有所思地看着明日香。

"You do that, Shinji," Asuka told him. _I'm doing this with or without your cooperation, Third. It doesn't matter to me either way._ "Now, about that training session," she said, approaching the boy again.  
“你就这么做吧，真嗣，”明日香对他说。不管你合不合作，我都会这么做，第三适格者。对我来说无所谓。“现在，关于那场训练，”她说着，再次走向男孩。

He immediately retreated in response. "H-hey, wait! I answered your questions! I don't have to get in the water!"  
他立刻后退回应。“嘿，等等！我回答了你的问题！我不需要下水！”

"Oh, was that what I agreed to? I simply can't recall," Asuka said innocently as she grabbed the boy into a hold to keep him from escaping. "Well, either way, I'm in charge here, and I say we're starting your workout. Come on, Idiot, today you're going to swim in the deep end all by yourself."  
“哦，那是我们达成的协议吗？我怎么一点印象都没有，”明日香无辜地说着，一把抓住男孩，防止他逃跑。“反正不管怎样，这里我说了算，我们要开始你的锻炼了。来吧，笨蛋，今天你要独自在深水区游泳。”

"Actually, I'm in charge here, but I do want to see where this is going!" Came the cheery voice of the Operations Director as she barged into the pool room. Asuka and Shinji both yelped, the girl releasing her hold on the boy as they jumped apart.  
“实际上，这里我说了算，但我确实想看看这会发展到哪里！”运营总监欢快的声音传来，她闯进了游泳池房间。明日香和真嗣同时惊叫，女孩松开了对男孩的控制，两人迅速跳开。

"Misato! How long have you been there?!" Asuka demanded.  
“美里！你在这里多久了？！”明日香质问道。

"Oh, I just walked in. Section Two informed me that you guys were down here making out and having a little victory celebration, so I decided to stop by," Misato accompanied this statement with a leering look.  
“哦，我刚进来。第二课通知我说你们在这儿亲热庆祝胜利，所以我就过来看看，”美里说着，脸上带着不怀好意的笑容。

"That's not what's going on! We were just talking!" The teens said in unison, each turning equally red at the insinuation.  
"事情不是那样的！我们只是在聊天！" 少年们异口同声地说道，每个人都被这暗示弄得脸红耳赤。

"If you say so!" Their superior officer said in a sing-song voice. "Hey, speaking of being in charge, maybe the Pilot Corps could benefit from some formal hierarchy," Misato pondered. "It would mean less work for me, if I could delegate to one of you guys." Her voice trailed off in thought. "Questions for another time!" She declared, seeing the fear in Shinji's eyes and the excited gleam in Asuka's.  
"如果你这么说的话！" 他们的上级指挥官用一种唱歌般的语调说道。"嘿，说到负责，也许飞行员部队可以从某种正式的等级制度中受益，" 美里思索着。"如果我能把工作分派给你们中的一个，那我的工作量就会少很多。" 她的声音渐渐低沉，陷入了思考。"这些问题留待下次再谈吧！" 她宣布道，看到真嗣眼中的恐惧和明日香兴奋的光芒。

_Easier for you? More like easier for me!_ Asuka thought. _Maybe people would finally have to start taking me seriously if I held a real rank!_  
对你来说更容易？更像是为我量身定做！明日香心想。如果我拥有真正的军衔，或许人们终于不得不开始认真对待我了！

"Asuka, I just wanted to tell you that I'll be conducting your debrief tomorrow morning. I finally finished telling those chucklefucks on that flight what I think of their life choices, one of them in particular, and I can't take any more bureaucracy for today." Misato collapsed into one of the poolside chairs near to where the pilots were finally recovering from their mortification.  
"明日早晨，我将负责你的汇报工作，明日早晨。我终于把那些飞行中的蠢货们，尤其是其中一个，对他们的人生选择有何看法告诉了他们，今天实在无法再应付更多繁文缛节了。" 美里瘫坐在飞行员们刚从尴尬中缓过神来的泳池边的一张椅子上。

"After that Rits wants to see you to—" Misato quirked her head at Asuka. "Change your bandages, which I see you've removed. She won't be happy about that," she smirked and stretched her body out along the chair she occupied. "Might want to bring a peace offering when you go to meet her. Get her a pack of cigarettes or some coffee."  
“之后理津子也想见你——”美里歪头看向明日香，“给你换绷带，我看你已经拆掉了。她可不会高兴的，”她微微一笑，在椅子上舒展身体。“去见她时最好带个和解礼物。给她带包烟或者咖啡什么的。”

"It's not like those bandages do anything anyway," Asuka muttered. "And she can fuel her own vices, as far as I'm concerned."  
"那些绷带本来也没什么用，" 明日香嘀咕道。"至于她怎么满足自己的坏习惯，我才懒得管。"

"Your funeral," Misato snorted.  
"随你的便，" 美里哼了一声。"

Asuka moved over to Shinji and grabbed him by the wrist, dragging him back towards the pool edge. "You can go now, Misato," Asuka griped. "We're going to get started on our training session." Shinji was putting up a light, mostly futile, struggle against the girl's direction, his plugsuited feet _squeak_ing as they were dragged across the tiled floor.  
明日香走到真嗣身边，抓住他的手腕，把他拖回泳池边。"你可以走了，美里，" 明日香抱怨道。"我们要开始训练了。" 真嗣在女孩的拉扯下轻微但基本无效地挣扎着，他的插入栓服脚底在瓷砖地板上摩擦发出吱吱声。

"Oh, no, I took the rest of the night off already—and like I said: I want to see where this is going!" Misato said happily. "You know, Shin-chan, lots of boys would pay good money for what you've got right now," she teased.  
"哦，不，我已经请了今晚剩下的假——就像我说的：我想看看这会发展到哪里！" 美里开心地说道。"你知道吗，真嗣，很多男孩会为现在你拥有的东西付大价钱的，"她打趣道。

_Misato, you old pervert, shut your mouth!  
美里，你这个老色鬼，闭嘴！_

Both teens again blushed, but before Shinji could stammer out a denial Asuka had already pushed him into the shallow end. After significantly less spluttering than the last time, Shinji stood up and glared angrily at the girl.  
两个少年再次脸红，但真嗣还没来得及结巴地否认，明日香已经把他推进了浅水区。这次比上次少了很多水花四溅，真嗣站起来，生气地瞪着女孩。

"Asuka! When are you going to stop doing that?!"  
"明日香！你什么时候才能不这么干？！"

"Maybe when you stop letting me, Third," she said smugly as she effortlessly slipped into the water behind him. _Just ignore her. You have a mission, Asuka. Your little chat with the Idiot should have been a nice reminder of the fact that this isn't just about beating the Angels; you need to set the stage and make sure all the bases are covered—just in case._  
"或许等你不再让我这么做的时候吧，三号。" 她得意地说着，轻松地滑入他身后的水中。别理她。你有任务在身，明日香。和那个白痴的对话应该提醒了你，这不仅仅是为了击败使徒；你需要铺好舞台，确保所有基础都稳固——以防万一。

Accompanied by cheers, whoops, and verbal encouragements from Misato, Asuka began to direct Shinji to warm up in the shallow end of the pool before moving on to exercises that required more confidence.  
在 Misato 的欢呼、口哨和口头鼓励声中，Asuka 开始指导 Shinji 在泳池浅水区进行热身，随后过渡到需要更多自信的练习。

Ω

"That's all I have for this debrief. Anything you want to add for the record?" Misato was sitting at her cluttered desk inside her even more cluttered office which rarely saw much use. She was half-hidden from sight behind the unsteady towers of ignored papers that made up her inbox. Asuka, the only other occupant of the room, was squeezed into an out of place folding chair sandwiched by a wall on one side and an unused filing cabinet on the other.  
"这就是本次汇报的全部内容。还有什么要补充的吗？" 美里坐在她那凌乱的办公桌前，身处一个同样杂乱无章的办公室，这里鲜少有人光顾。她半隐在摇摇欲坠的文件堆后，这些被忽视的纸张构成了她的待办事项。房间里唯一的另一位居住者——明日香，则挤在一个不合时宜的折叠椅上，一边是墙壁，另一边则紧挨着一个未曾使用的文件柜。

_Just the weird feeling of synching with Unit 01, still, which I should have talked to the Third about at the pool. Damn it, I let myself get distracted yesterday!_ _I can't afford to let that kind of thing happen again. Although maybe that's something I should hold off on for a while yet. No need to make him more skittish about getting into the entry plug._  
只是与初号机同步时的那种奇怪感觉，我本该在泳池边和第三适格者讨论的。该死，昨天我让自己分心了！我不能再让这种事发生。不过，也许这事儿我应该暂时搁置。没必要让他对进入驾驶舱更加紧张。

"No," Asuka replied, shaking her head. "It was an easy fight. The Angel showed up, I kicked its ass. Nothing more to it," she said proudly.  
"没有，" 明日香回答，摇了摇头。"那是一场轻松的战斗。使徒出现了，我把它打趴下了。没什么更多可说的了，" 她自豪地说道。

"Well, let's not count on that being the case moving forward," Misato said. Asuka couldn't see the smirk on her face, but she could hear it. "Still, you—"  
“好吧，我们别指望这种情况会持续下去，”美里说道。明日香看不到她脸上的讥笑，但能听出来。“不过，你——”

She was interrupted by a knock at her office door. "Eh? Come in," she called out from behind her paper stronghold. The door opened and a disheveled man stepped confidently into the room.  
她被敲门声打断。“嗯？进来吧，”她从文件堆后喊道。门开了，一个衣冠不整的男人自信地走进了房间。

"You!" Misato said darkly.  
“是你！”美里阴沉地说。

"Kaji?" Asuka said at the same time. _What the hell are you doing here?_ She furrowed her brow in thought. _Unit 02 doesn't ship out until next week. It won't arrive until almost a month from now. You're supposed to be with it! That's what happened last time!_  
“加持？”明日香同时说道。你到底在这里干什么？她皱起眉头思考。二号机下周才出发。要差不多一个月后才能到达。你应该和它在一起的！上次就是这样！

"Me," he replied coolly. He leaned against the doorframe and crossed his arms nonchalantly.  
“我。”他冷冷地回答。他懒洋洋地靠在门框上，随意地交叉着双臂。

"What the hell are you doing here?" Misato demanded as she jumped up from her seat and slammed her hands down on her desk, bracing herself against it. A flurry of papers sailed off the desk and floated to the ground.  
“你到底在这里干什么？”美里厉声质问，猛地从座位上跳起，双手重重拍在桌上，身体前倾支撑着。一叠文件从桌上飞散开来，飘落到地面。

_Exactly! Wait, why am I agreeing with Misato?  
没错！等等，我怎么在附和美里？_

"Oh, I just wanted to stop by and see a special someone," he explained smugly.  
“哦，我只是想顺道来看看某个特别的人。”他得意地解释道。

"And who said I wanted to see you?" Misato _hmph_ed and turned her nose up at the man.  
“谁说我想要见你了？”美里哼了一声，对那人嗤之以鼻。

"Oh, did I imply it was _you_? My apologies, Katsuragi. I'm _actually_ here for our resident Angel killer," he said as he pushed himself off of the doorframe and inclined his head toward Asuka. He flashed her a grin. "Nice job out there, kiddo. And you really pulled through for me—not too many Angel defenses on NERV Airways."  
“哦，我暗示过是你吗？抱歉，葛城。我其实是来找我们这里的使徒杀手。”他说着从门框上起身，向明日香微微点头。他朝她露齿一笑。“干得漂亮，小家伙。你真是为我撑住了场面——NERV 航空上没多少使徒防御措施。”

Asuka smiled at the praise, but it was not as genuine as she would have thought it would be. Partly because she was distracted by his statement. _What does he mean "pulled through for him?" Was he—_  
明日香对这番赞扬报以微笑，但那笑容并不如她预想中那般真挚。部分原因是她被他的话分了心。他说的“为他挺过来了”是什么意思？难道他——

"Wait, that flight was you?! What the _hell_, Kaji?!" Asuka demanded, rising swiftly from her seat. She planted her hands on her hips and scowled at the man. _Why would the Angel be interested in you? And why didn't Misato tell me?!_  
“等等，那趟航班是你？！搞什么鬼，加持？！”明日香厉声质问，迅速从座位上站起。她双手叉腰，怒视着那个男人。为什么使徒会对你感兴趣？还有，美里怎么没告诉我？！

Kaji chuckled and raised a hand towards the pilot in supplication. "I serve at the pleasure of the UN," he explained. "Apparently, it pleased them to send an inspector to NERV Central, and they just so happened to have one languishing in Berlin—"  
加持轻笑一声，向驾驶员举手示意。“我听命于联合国，”他解释道，“显然，他们觉得有必要派一位监察官来 NERV 总部，而恰好柏林有一位闲着的——”

"Is _that_ what you call it?" Misato grumbled.  
"这就是你所谓的称呼吗？" 美里咕哝道。

"—with the added bonus of him being the formal guardian of the Second Child, also recently relocated to Tokyo-III." Both women narrowed their eyes at the man, who raised his other hand to join its twin in a surrender posture. "So, I found myself on a direct flight to Japan, with a rather unlooked-for welcoming committee that was thankfully dispatched before my arrival."  
"——再加上他还是第二适格者的正式监护人，最近也搬到了第三新东京市。" 两位女士都眯起眼睛盯着那个男人，他只好举起另一只手，与先前那只手一起做出投降的姿势。"于是，我发现自己搭上了直飞日本的航班，还有一群意料之外的欢迎队伍，好在抵达前他们已经被打发了。"

_I suppose that makes sense. But it doesn't explain why the Angel was so intent on the plane. Last time they attacked Unit 02 while it was in transit. Did it somehow know about my transfer this time, and it just showed up a few days late, expecting me to be on that flight? Are they planning ahead?  
我想这说得通。但无法解释使徒为何如此执着于那架飞机。上次它们在二号机运输途中发动了攻击。难道这次它们预知了我的调动，只是迟了几天出现，以为我会在那趟航班上？它们是在提前布局吗？_

"Yes, you have your convenient excuses that bring you to my door. I already explained to you yesterday what I think of your brilliant decision making. Now get out," Misato demanded.  
"是的，你有你的方便借口，把我这儿当门路。我昨天已经告诉过你，我对你的英明决策有何看法。现在滚出去，" 美里命令道。

_The Angels didn't seem like they put any forethought into their attacks, but could things just be different now? Ugh, I need to revisit the plan. I didn't account for these kinds of variables. Stupid girl, you should have seen this coming._ Asuka could feel a headache start to set in.  
使徒的攻击似乎毫无预谋，但现在情况会不同吗？唉，我得重新审视计划了。我未曾考虑到这些变数。笨蛋，你早该预见到的。明日香感到一阵头痛开始袭来。

"So harsh, Katsuragi. How was anyone supposed to know that an Angel would be standing ready to waylay some helpless travelers? Won't you go easy on me, for old time's sake?" Implored the Inspector.  
"真严厉啊，葛城。谁能预料到会有使徒埋伏等待无助的旅人呢？看在过去的份上，不能对我宽容些吗？" 监察官恳求道。

Misato snorted in response. "Asuka, your debriefing is over. You can head down to see Doctor Akagi now—please do me a favor and take this awful man with you on your way out." She retook her seat and picked up a pile of papers at random, making a show of dismissing the other occupants as she pretended to write.  
美里哼了一声作为回应。“明日香，你的汇报结束了。现在你可以去见赤木博士了——请帮我个忙，出去的时候把这个讨厌的男人也带走。”她重新坐下，随意拿起一叠文件，装作写字的样子，以此来打发其他人离开。

"Well, I can tell when I'm not wanted," Kaji said with a smile and a wink to Misato; she returned his gesture with a stuck-out tongue and an obscene sign that Asuka couldn't see from behind the stacks of papers. He proffered an arm to the pilot. "Shall we go, kiddo?"  
“好吧，我知道什么时候该识趣。”加持笑着眨眼向美里示意；美里则伸出舌头，做了个下流的手势，明日香从文件堆后面看不到。他向驾驶员伸出手臂。“我们走吧，小家伙？”

"Sure, Kaji," Asuka said as she threaded her arm through his and led him out of the small office. _I knew things wouldn't be exactly the same, but this is a bit much._ The door _whoosh_ed shut behind the pair as they made their way down the hallway and towards a bank of elevators.  
“当然，加持。”明日香说着，将手臂穿过他的，领着他走出小办公室。我知道事情不会完全一样，但这也太过分了。两人走向走廊，朝电梯间走去，身后门轻轻地关上了。

"How have you been settling in here, Asuka?" Kaji asked as he pressed the call button for an elevator.  
"你在这里适应得怎么样，明日香？" 加持按下电梯的呼叫按钮时问道。

Asuka sighed theatrically. "Well enough, I suppose," she bemoaned. _With Kaji here so early, what else is going to be different?_ "At least my quarters are decent."  
明日香夸张地叹了口气。“还算过得去吧，”她抱怨道。既然加持这么早就来了，还有什么会不一样呢？“至少我的房间还算整洁。”

Kaji nodded sagely as they boarded an elevator. He pressed the button for the medical floor without prompting. "It's important to have a place to relax," he said. "How about the other pilots?" He raised his eyebrows at Asuka. "I hear you've been spending time with the Third Child."  
加治点了点头，显得颇为睿智，他们一起走进电梯。他未等提示便按下了通往医疗层的按钮。“有个地方放松很重要，”他说道，“其他驾驶员呢？”他向明日香挑了挑眉。“听说你最近和第三适格者走得很近。”

Asuka's eyes widened and a faint blush rose on her face. "It's not like that!" She insisted. _How many times do I have to explain this!_ "Training the Third Child is half the reason I'm here right now, so of course we're going to be together sometimes!" She huffed angrily. "And as for the First Child, I haven't seen her except in passing." _We're going to have to meet eventually. Maybe this time someone will order her to learn how to hold a conversation beforehand._  
明日香瞪大了眼睛，脸上泛起淡淡的红晕。“才不是那样！”她坚持道。我得解释多少遍啊！“训练第三适格者是我现在在这里的一半原因，所以我们当然有时会在一起！”她气呼呼地说。“至于第一适格者，除了偶尔碰面，我还没怎么见过她。”我们迟早得见面。也许这次会有人事先命令她学会如何与人交谈。

"I'm sure you'll get to know her soon," Kaji laughed, gracefully changing the subject. The elevator doors opened, and the pair threaded their way through a stream of doctors, technicians, and nurses.  
“我相信你很快就会了解她的，”加治笑着，巧妙地转换了话题。电梯门打开，两人穿过一群医生、技术人员和护士。

"We'll see," Asuka replied. They arrived at the examination room she had been told to wait for Akagi in, the same one she had seen her in the previous two times she had been down here. As she settled herself into a seated position on the exam bed, Kaji poked around the various cabinets and drawers in the room. _Inspector Kaji taking his role a little too seriously, eh?_  
"我们会看到的，" 明日香回答道。他们来到了她被告知要等待赤木律子的检查室，正是她前两次下来时见到她的同一个房间。她坐在检查床上，而加持则在房间里的各种橱柜和抽屉中翻找。加持警官是不是对自己的角色太认真了，嗯？

After only a brief moment of waiting, the door to the exam room opened to admit a tired-looking Doctor Akagi who took one glance at the pilot's unbandaged hands and rolled her eyes. "Of course. You couldn't leave well enough alone," she complained as she gently shoved Kaji away from a cabinet to pull out a sealed package of bandages from it.  
仅仅等待了片刻，检查室的门便打开了，一脸疲惫的赤木律子医生走了进来，她瞥了一眼驾驶员未包扎的双手，翻了个白眼。“当然，你就不能安分点吗？”她抱怨着，轻轻推开加持，从橱柜里拿出一个密封的绷带包。

"Ah, Rits, go easy on her," Kaji said, pulling out a pack of cigarettes and tapping one small cylinder out to stand over the rest of the pack. The Doctor raised an eyebrow at him, then smirked and grabbed the whole pack from his hand. She plucked the raised cigarette out and brought it to her lips while she pocketed the pack.  
“啊，律子，对她温柔点，”加持说着，掏出一包香烟，敲出一根小圆柱，让它立在烟盒上。医生对他扬了扬眉，然后微微一笑，从他手中夺过整包烟。她抽出那根立着的香烟，叼在嘴上，同时把烟盒塞进口袋。

Kaji chuckled and raised a lighter up to her, which she cupped her hands around and used to ignite her prize. "I suppose there's something to be said for initiative." She said from within a cloud of blue-grey smoke.  
加治轻声笑了起来，将打火机举到她面前，她双手拢住火苗，点燃了她的战利品。“我想主动出击还是有其可取之处的。”她从一团蓝灰色的烟雾中说道。

"The bandages don't do anything anyway, they're just a placebo," Asuka complained. _Smoking in front of a patient. Again. And Kaji is encouraging her!_ "I wasn't even feeling any pain after I took them off. It's not like my synch score was high enough for physical injuries to manifest."  
“这些绷带根本没用，只是安慰剂罢了，”明日香抱怨道。在病人面前抽烟，又是这样。而且加持还在纵容她！“我拆掉绷带后甚至没感觉到疼痛。我的同步率又没高到能让身体受伤的程度。”

Akagi _hmm_ed in thought as she sat on a stool in front of Asuka and opened up the bandages. "That's the prevailing theory about injuries and synch rates, yes," she said. "But we haven't gotten a chance to test it, as I'm sure you're aware. It'd be unethical to ask for volunteers for something like that. Or so I'm told," she said with a tight grin. "Hopefully, for your sake, it's something we never have to find out about."  
赤木律子坐在明日香面前的凳子上，沉吟着打开绷带。“关于伤势和同步率的主流理论确实如此，”她说，“但你知道，我们还没机会测试这一点。要求志愿者参与这种实验是不道德的，或者我是这么被告知的。”她带着一丝苦笑说，“希望，为了你好，我们永远不必弄清楚这一点。”

Asuka did not reach up to reassure herself that her eye was still intact, nor did she shudder at the memory of being eaten alive. _Well, I suppose I could satisfy her academic curiosity after this is all over and I can maybe think about spilling some secrets._  
明日香并未伸手去确认自己的眼睛是否完好无损，也没有因被活生生吞噬的记忆而颤抖。好吧，我想等这一切结束后，我可以满足她的学术好奇心，或许还能考虑透露一些秘密。

"And don't devalue a placebo," Akagi said, as she finished wrapping one hand and moved to the other. "Even when the patient knows they're receiving a placebo, they still have a positive effect. The power of the mind, and all that."  
“别小看了安慰剂的作用，”赤木说道，她刚包扎完一只手，又转向另一只。“即便患者知道自己在接受安慰剂，它依然能产生积极效果。这就是心灵的力量，诸如此类。”

"This is all getting a bit outside my wheelhouse. Ladies, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to head out," Kaji said, making his way for the exit.  
“这一切对我来说有点超出我的专业范畴了。女士们，如果你们不介意，我先告辞了。”卡吉说着，朝出口走去。

"You should stop by my quarters later this evening, Kaji!" Asuka insisted. "We need to have dinner together to celebrate my victory and you coming to Japan!" _I can squeeze some more details out of him then, maybe help me paint a better picture moving forward._  
"“今晚你该来我房间坐坐，加持！”明日香坚持道，“我们得一起吃顿饭庆祝我的胜利和你来日本！”到时我或许能从他那儿套出更多细节，帮我更好地描绘未来的蓝图。”

"Maybe another time, kiddo," Kaji deflected, giving her an apologetic smile. "I'm pretty busy with my UN Inspector duties at the moment. No rest for the wicked, after all," he joked.  
"“或许改天吧，小家伙，”加持婉拒道，向她露出歉意的微笑，“我现在忙于联合国检查员的职责，毕竟，恶人无暇休息嘛。”他打趣道。”

_Then what the hell were you doing barging into Misato's office and coming with me to see Doctor Akagi?_ "Oh, we simply have to do it sometime! Call me?" She batted her eyes at the man in a move she knew never worked.  
"“那你刚才闯进美里办公室还跟我去找赤木博士是在干嘛？”“哦，我们总得找个时间做这件事！给我打电话？”她对着他眨眼，使出她知道从未奏效的一招。”

"We'll see," he replied coolly. "Take care, ladies," he said as he walked out the door.  
"我们走着瞧，"他冷冷地回答。"保重，女士们，"他说着走出了门。

"Watch yourself out there, Ryoji," Akagi warned as she finished wrapping Asuka's other hand.  
"在外面小心点，Ryoji，"Akagi 警告道，同时完成了对 Asuka 另一只手的包扎。

"I always do, Rits," came his response as the door shut behind him.  
"我一直都很小心，Rits，"他的声音随着门在他身后关闭而传来。

Akagi shook her head and sighed to herself. "That man is always looking for trouble. Well, Asuka, you're all set. Head up to the labs and talk to Lieutenant Ibuki; she's working on regenerating the damaged tissue on Unit 01, and you can give her a hand. And don't remove the bandages this time? Humor me, please," she implored.  
赤木摇了摇头，暗自叹息。“那男人总是自找麻烦。好了，明日香，你准备好了。去实验室找伊吹摩耶中尉吧；她正在为零号机再生受损组织，你可以帮帮她。这次别再拆绷带了，好吗？就当是迁就我吧，”她恳求道。

"Fine, fine, whatever you say, Doctor. I'm just taking the Third running today anyway, so the bandages won't get in the way of training," Asuka grumbled. _What did she mean "watch yourself out there?" Does this have something to do with how Kaji—how he died? What is he up to?_  
“好吧，好吧，随你怎么说，博士。反正我今天只是跑第三圈，绷带不会妨碍训练的。”明日香嘟囔着。她说的“在外面小心点”是什么意思？这和加持——他是怎么死的有关吗？他到底在搞什么鬼？

"Glad to hear it. Now get going, we've both got better things to do than sit around here chatting," she said as she pulled another cigarette from her pilfered stash and headed out the door.  
"很高兴听你这么说。现在快走吧，我们都有比在这里闲聊更重要的事情要做，" 她说着从偷来的烟盒里又抽出一支烟，走出了门。

_Right. Like completely reevaluating my plan to unfuck things around here,_ Asuka thought as she stood up and made her own way out.  
对啊。就像彻底重新评估我在这里收拾烂摊子的计划，明日香心想，她站起身来，自己走了出去。

### Chapter 7

Μόνου γαρ αυτού και θεός στερίσκεται, αγένητα ποιείν άσσ᾽ αν ᾖ πεπραγμένα (Of this, even god is deprived, the power to make things that are past to never have been) — Attributed to Agathon, 5th Century BCE  
唯有此事，纵使神明亦无法改变，即令过往之事未曾发生——据传为阿伽同（公元前 5 世纪）所言

Asuka sat at a terminal, one of many manned stations in the operations center, and observed with half an eye a stream of data being fed to her screen that detailed the Third Child's status. The other half of her attention was focused on the video feed of Unit 01's entry plug. It displayed a relaxed-looking pilot with his head bowed and eyes closed, his arms extended, and hands loosely gripped around the handles set into the control board in front of him.  
明日香坐在操作中心众多有人值守的终端之一，用半只眼观察着屏幕上源源不断传来的数据，这些数据详细记录了第三适格者的状态。她的另一半注意力则集中在零号机插入栓的视频画面上。画面中，驾驶员头部低垂，双眼紧闭，神情放松，双臂伸展，双手松松地握着控制板上的操纵杆。

This was both the first activation test for the Third Child since Asuka had arrived in Japan, and also the first activation test she had ever been on the observing and controlling side of—even counting her mulligan. _Plenty of firsts still left for me,_ she thought idly as she propped an elbow up on her workstation and rested her chin in an upraised hand. Her eyes widened slightly, and a blush spread across her cheeks as the implications of that thought suddenly occurred to her. _These lecherous old people are getting to me. Old people should be shot,_ she thought, as she quietly cleared her throat and sat up straight. She took a discreet glance around the room to ensure her little slip had gone unnoticed, but none of the other occupants were paying her any mind.  
这是自明日香来到日本后，第三适格者的首次启动测试，也是她第一次站在观察和控制的一方——即便算上她的重来机会。她漫不经心地想着，还有许多第一次等着我呢，她一边想着一边将手肘撑在工作台上，用手掌托着下巴。她的眼睛微微睁大，脸颊上泛起了一抹红晕，突然间意识到这个想法的含义。这些好色的老家伙们影响了我。老人应该被枪毙，她想着，轻轻地清了清嗓子，坐直了身子。她悄悄地环顾了一下房间，确保自己的小失误没有被注意到，但其他人都没在关注她。

"Initialization complete. We're ready for the activation test, Ma'am," said Maya from a few stations down.  
“初始化完成。我们已经准备好进行启动测试了，女士。”玛雅从几个工作站之外说道。

"Great," replied Misato. "Shinji, we're all set on our end, the rest is up to you. Remember: just relax and keep a clear mind."  
“太好了，”美里回答道。“真嗣，我们这边都准备好了，剩下的就看你的了。记住：放松，保持头脑清醒。”

_He knows how to do this, Misato! What the hell do you think I've been teaching him?_ Asuka scowled at her screen.  
他知道怎么做的，美里！你以为我一直在教他什么？明日香对着屏幕皱起了眉头。

"I know, Misato-san," the Third Child replied without lifting his head or opening his eyes. "Asuka was, umm, pretty thorough with her explanations on all of this. Sorry, I didn't mean it like that," he said, his head stooping a little lower.  
“我知道，美里小姐，”第三适格者回答道，头也没抬，眼睛也没睁开。“明日香在解释这些方面，嗯，非常详尽。抱歉，我不是那个意思，”他说着，头更低了一些。

Asuka's eyebrow twitched and her scowl deepened. _You're damn right I was thorough, Third. And stop apologizing for everything! There's got to be some sort of assertiveness course I can put him through before all this is done._  
明日香的眉毛抽动了一下，眉头皱得更深了。你说得对，第三适格者，我确实很详尽。还有，别再为每件事道歉了！在这之前，我得找个什么自信训练课程让他参加。

"Well, I wouldn't want to step on Drill Sergeant Soryu's toes on this one," Misato said as she leered at Asuka, who pointedly did not look at her nor show a reaction to her teasing. "Well, let's get started, then," she said, a note of disappointment in her voice.  
“好吧，我可不想踩到索吕中士的脚趾头，”美里说着，目光不善地盯着明日香，后者故意不与她对视，也没有对她的调侃做出反应。“那么，我们开始吧，”她语气中带着一丝失望地说道。

As the area settled into the buzz of normal operations, Asuka kept her focus on the video feed displayed on the large monitors at the front of the room. The data feed on her terminal would not hold any information she wanted that carefully monitoring the Third Child could not glean. _He seems to have found a comfortable position, at least. It can be hell in those seats, sometimes, when you're in there for hours._  
随着区域恢复到日常运作的嗡嗡声中，明日香将注意力集中在房间前方大屏幕上显示的视频反馈上。她终端上的数据流不会提供她想要的任何信息，而仔细监控第三适格者却能获取。至少，他似乎找到了一个舒适的姿势。有时候，坐在那些座位上几个小时，简直是地狱般的煎熬。

The boy had not moved since he had spoken to Misato, at least not that Asuka could see. After a few short moments that technicians in the background spent commenting on different variables and factors that were affecting the synchronization between pilot and Eva, Asuka saw the Third Child raise his head slightly and tighten his grip on the control yokes. _He's got it. Maybe today I should ask him about how it feels when he synchs with Unit 01. I guess I'll see how skittish he is later._  
自从那男孩和美里说话后，他就没有动过，至少明日香没看到他有任何动作。在技术人员们短暂地讨论了影响驾驶员与 EVA 同步的各种变量和因素后，明日香看到第三适格者微微抬起头，紧握住控制杆。他掌握了。也许今天我该问问他与零一单元同步时的感觉。我猜待会儿看看他有多紧张就知道了。

"Activation successful," Maya said from her station.  
"激活成功," 玛雅从她的工作站说道。

"Good job, Shinji! Just sit tight for a little while, then you'll be free to go," Misato said to the pilot as she stepped up next to Maya and placed one hand the console next to her station, leaning on it. She glanced over the data on the younger woman's screen.  
"干得好，真嗣！稍微再等一会儿，你就可以自由离开了，" 美里对驾驶员说道，同时走到玛雅旁边，一只手放在她工作站旁的控制台上，倚靠着。她瞥了一眼年轻女子屏幕上的数据。

"Um, sure, Misato-san," Shinji said quietly without looking up.  
"嗯，好的，美里小姐，" 真嗣低声回答，没有抬头。

_Good, he seems to be taking this seriously,_ Asuka thought. _Ten days' worth of training is already paying off. Of course it is, what else would one expect of the Great Asuka Langley Soryu?_  
很好，他似乎很认真对待这件事，明日香心想。十天的训练已经开始见效了。当然会见效，不然还能指望伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷有什么表现呢？

Misato gave a pointed look and gestured towards Hyuga before returning her gaze to Maya's computer screen. The other technician flipped a switch in front of him and turned to face Misato.  
美里意味深长地看了日向一眼，然后又将目光转回到真希的电脑屏幕上。另一位技术员在他面前拨动了一个开关，转向美里。

"Intercom's off, Ma'am, let me know when you want me to return communications," he informed her.  
“通讯已经关闭了，上尉，需要恢复通讯时请告诉我。”他向她报告道。

"Thanks, Hyuga," she said, squinting her eyes at the data in front of her. "I can't read this stuff. Give me the highlights, Maya," she said with exasperation.  
"谢谢，日向，" 她眯着眼睛看着面前的数据说。"我看不懂这些。给我讲讲重点吧，摩耶，" 她带着不耐烦的语气说道。

_Come on, Misato, it's not complicated,_ Asuka groaned to herself. She looked at her own, identical, data feed and surmised that everything was perfectly in line with what was expected for the Third Child in Unit 01. _Decently high synch rate with the test type, vitals normal, psychograph stable, Unit 01 responding to system tests, it's all there. Of course, put this thing in front of an Angel and it'll be a different story,_ she thought, recalling all the times Unit 01 performed erratically—even when she was inside of it.  
拜托，美里，这并不复杂，" 明日香自言自语地抱怨道。她看着自己那份相同的数据流，推断出一切都与初号机第三适格者预期的情况完全一致。与测试机型同步率良好，生命体征正常，心理图谱稳定，初号机对系统测试有响应，所有信息都在那里。当然，把这东西放在使徒面前，情况就完全不同了，她想起了初号机多次表现出的异常行为——即使她当时在驾驶舱内。

"Oh, I can explain it, Ma'am," Maya said happily. She began pointing out different sections of her screen. "This portion shows the Pilot's vitals: heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and oxygen saturation. And here's the section that shows the feedback we get from the system communicating with Unit 01—"  
"哦，我可以解释，女士，" 摩耶开心地说道。她开始指出屏幕上的不同部分。"这一部分显示了驾驶员的生命体征：心率、血压、体温和血氧饱和度。而这里显示的是系统与初号机通信反馈的部分——"

"Yeah, can I just get his synch rate?" Misato interrupted, rubbing the back of her neck and smiling apologetically. "All that stuff sounds useful, but I'm just looking for a metric to measure his progress with Unit 01."  
“嗯，我能问一下他的同步率吗？”美里打断道，揉着后颈歉意地笑了笑，“那些信息听起来都很有用，但我现在只想找个指标来衡量他和初号机的进展。”

"Ah, umm, I see," the technician said. "Well," she began, pointing to another section of her screen, "the Pilot's synch rate is displayed here. Currently at 58%."  
“啊，嗯，我明白了，”技术员说道。“那么，”她指着屏幕的另一部分开始解释，“这里显示的是驾驶员的同步率。目前是 58%。”

Misato nodded and cast a look towards Asuka, who had been splitting her attention between the other technician's demonstration and her own monitor. "I see. Thanks, Maya. That's an improvement from his time against the Third Angel, all with just a couple of hours of simulation time." She smirked at Asuka. "Must be something else to account for his improvement, then."  
美里点头，向明日香投去一眼，后者正将注意力在其他技术人员的演示和自己的显示器之间来回切换。“我明白了。谢谢你，玛雅。比起他对战第三使徒时的表现，这确实是个进步，仅仅用了几个小时的模拟时间。”她对明日香微微一笑。“那么，他的进步肯定还有其他原因。”

_I'm trying to be professional, here,_ Asuka sulked as her desire to loudly proclaim the superiority of her teaching abilities was manifesting.  
我在这里尽量保持专业，明日香不满地嘟囔着，她那大声宣扬自己教学能力优越的欲望正在显现。

"I wonder what it could be, though?" Misato asked as she put on an inquisitive face and tapped her chin. She kept shooting Asuka conspiratorial glances that the girl did not return. "Maybe there's something in the water?"  
“不过，会是什么呢？”美里摆出一副好奇的表情，轻敲着下巴问道。她不时向明日香投去心照不宣的眼神，但对方并未回应。“或许是水里有什么东西？”

_Misato, you're the worst at this. What kind of bait is that?_ Asuka thought as she fidgeted slightly in her seat.  
美里，你在这方面真是最差劲的。那种诱饵算什么？明日香坐在椅子上微微扭动着身体，心里想着。

"Rits, what do you think? Do the Magi have any ideas?" She turned to face her friend and waltzed slowly towards the terminal she was typing away at, overfull ash tray and empty coffee mug placed precariously next to the keyboard. "I just can't think of anything, myself."  
律子，你怎么看？MAGI 有什么想法吗？" 她转向她的朋友，缓缓走向她正在打字的终端，烟灰缸满溢，空咖啡杯就放在键盘旁边，摇摇欲坠。"我自己实在是想不出什么办法了。

"It could be due to any number of factors," Akagi replied without looking up from her screen. She took the moment to take a break from typing and pull out a cigarette which she quickly lit before returning to her task. "Isn't pilot development more your field anyway?" She asked sweetly. "Maybe the answer lies closer than you think."  
"这可能是由多种因素导致的，"赤木回答道，目光依旧停留在屏幕上。她趁机停下手中的打字，抽出一支烟迅速点燃，随后又继续工作。"飞行员培养不是更属于你的领域吗？"她甜甜地问道，"或许答案比你想象的更近。"

_Ok, she's worse,_ Asuka grimaced at her workstation.  
"好吧，她更糟了。" 明日香皱着眉头看着她的工作站。

"Hmm, you've got a point," Misato replied, turning back to smirk at the back of Asuka's head. "Anyone have any thoughts?" The other occupants of the control room exchanged glances as the charade continued to play out.  
"嗯，你说得有道理，" 美里回答道，转过身来对着明日香的后脑勺微微一笑。"有人有什么想法吗？" 控制室里的其他成员互相交换了一下眼神，这场戏继续上演着。

_Fine! You win!_ "Obviously the Third Child's dramatic improvement is due to my training," Asuka boasted. She spun her chair around and jumped up out of it, crossing her arms and smirking at Misato. "It seems that even with him spending only minimal time in the Eva, my superior skills and abilities have begun to rub off on him. Now that the repairs are complete and we can spend more time getting practical experience, I guarantee you'll see even better results!" She promised.  
好吧！你赢了！“显然，三笕的显著进步归功于我的训练，”明日香自夸道。她转过椅子，一跃而起，双臂交叉，得意地朝美里笑道：“尽管他只在 Eva 上花费了极少时间，但我卓越的技能和能力已经开始影响他。现在修复工作完成了，我们可以有更多时间积累实战经验，我保证你会看到更出色的成果！”她承诺道。

"Oh?" Misato queried, leering at Asuka. "Rubbing off? Practical experience? My, my, maybe I need to keep a closer eye on your little training sessions with Shin-chan," she teetered, covering her mouth with one hand in mock outrage.  
"哦？" 美里挑眉，斜睨着明日香。"磨合？实践经验？哎呀呀，或许我得更加留意你和真嗣君的小训练课了，"她故作震惊地用手掩嘴，摇摇晃晃。

Asuka's eyes shot open to the size of dinner plates and her face turned beet red. "Misato!" She protested, crossing her arms angrily as she turned her head to the side and thrust her chin up. She _hmmph_ed indignantly. _I can't believe I walked right into that! These disgusting old people only ever think about—that!_ "Do you have any more filthy jokes to share? Or can we get back to work?"  
明日香的双眼瞪得像餐盘一样大，脸颊涨得通红。"美里！"她抗议道，气呼呼地交叉双臂，扭头扬起下巴，不满地哼了一声。我真不敢相信自己居然中了这种圈套！这些可恶的大人脑子里除了那些事就没别的了！"你还有更多下流的笑话要讲吗？还是说我们可以回去工作了？"

The Captain smiled softly and placed her hands on her hips. "No, I think that'll do for now, Asuka," she said. "Actually," she continued, as she checked the time, "the test is over soon. Let's you and I head down to the changing rooms and wait for Shinji to finish up—I've got something I want to talk to you about."  
舰长温柔地笑了笑，双手叉腰。“不，我想现在这样就可以了，明日香，”她说道。“实际上，”她继续说着，看了看时间，“测试很快就要结束了。我们一起去更衣室等真嗣完成吧——我有件事想和你谈谈。”

_Fuck. Did I slip up? What does she know? No, calm down; there's no reason to think she suspects anything. This is probably nothing._ "Fine," Asuka grumbled as she powered down her workstation and pushed her chair back into place.  
该死。我是不是露馅了？她知道什么？不，冷静下来；没有理由认为她怀疑什么。这可能没什么。“好吧，”明日香咕哝着，关闭了工作站，将椅子推回原位。

"Great!" Misato cheered. "Hyuga, let Shinji know that we're waiting for him once you guys finalize things, will you?" She called to the man as she ushered Asuka out of the operations center. "Rits, I'll see you later!"  
“太好了！”美里欢呼道。“日向，等你们处理完事情后，告诉真嗣我们在等他，好吗？”她一边催促明日香离开操作中心，一边对那人喊道。“律子，回头见！”

Any replies were lost to the door quickly closing behind the pair as they made their way to the nearby bank of elevators. Misato pressed one of the call buttons while Asuka sulked. _There's nothing noteworthy about today, as far as I can remember. My Unit 02 departs from Wilhelmshaven tomorrow, is that what this is about?_  
任何回应都被两人身后迅速关闭的门所吞没，他们朝着附近的电梯间走去。美里按下了呼叫按钮，而明日香则闷闷不乐。就我所记得的，今天没什么特别之处。我的二号机明天要从威廉港出发，是因为这个吗？

When the elevator doors opened, Misato gently nudged the younger girl inside and followed in behind her, pressing the button for Asuka's most frequently visited level of Headquarters. "I'm having a little party at my place tonight," Misato nonchalantly stated as she leaned against the wall of the elevator with her arms crossed.  
电梯门打开时，美里轻轻推着年轻女孩进去，随后自己也跟了进去，按下了明日香最常去的总部楼层按钮。“今晚我那儿有个小聚会，”美里若无其事地说着，双臂交叉靠在电梯墙上。

"For what?" Asuka asked, raising an eyebrow at the woman. _Why would I care what you do in your apartment? What, do you need my help planning it or something? I'm sure you, Shinji, and the bird will all get along great and have_ such _a nice time._  
"庆祝什么？" 明日香问道，对那女人挑了挑眉。我干嘛要在乎你在公寓里做什么？怎么，你需要我帮忙计划吗？我敢肯定你、真嗣和那只鸟会相处得很好，度过一段愉快的时光。

Misato laughed lightly. "Do I need a reason? Call it a celebration."  
美里轻声笑了笑。"需要理由吗？就当是庆祝吧。"

"What are you celebrating?"  
"你在庆祝什么？"

She scoffed at that. "Come on, Asuka. How about we never properly celebrated you defeating the last Angel? Or you arriving in Japan? Or how successful your training with Shinji is going? Take your pick."  
她对此嗤之以鼻。“拜托，明日香。我们什么时候好好庆祝过你击败最后一个使徒？或是你来到日本？还有你和真嗣训练的成果？随便挑一个吧。”

_Wait, she wants me to be there too? Why would I waste my time with that nonsense?_ "Don't we all have better things to do?" Asuka said as the elevator doors opened once again, and Misato led them out towards the pilot changing rooms.  
等等，她也想让我去？我为什么要浪费时间在这种无聊事上？“我们不是都有更重要的事做吗？”明日香说着，电梯门再次打开，美里带着他们走向驾驶员更衣室。

"On a Sunday night? Absolutely not," Misato informed her merrily. "You don't have your _private session_ with Shinji tonight, I finally cleared out my backlog of paperwork, and even Rits has some free time! So tonight, we celebrate at my place: dinner, drinks, and good times. Well, maybe not the drinks." She said bashfully as the pair came to a halt at the entrance to the male locker room. "Shin-chan's been on my case about that. The little bastard threatened to throw out my beer stockpile!" She shook her head ruefully.  
"周日晚上？绝对不行，"美里愉快地告诉她。"你今晚没有和真嗣的私人时间，我终于清空了积压的文件，甚至连律子都有空闲！所以今晚，我们就在我家庆祝：晚餐、饮品，还有欢乐时光。呃，可能没有饮品。"她羞涩地说道，两人在男更衣室入口停下脚步。"真-酱一直唠叨这事。那小混蛋威胁要扔掉我的啤酒存货！"她懊恼地摇了摇头。

"I didn't think he had it in him. I told him I'd cut down, and he just gave me this deadpan look." Misato contorted her face into a mask of disappointment and skepticism, with a touch of incredulity. "Just like this," she intoned flatly. Her face returned to its normal cheeky smirk as she chuckled.  
"我没想到他会有这反应。我告诉他我会减少，他只是给了我一个面无表情的样子。" 美里扭曲着脸，表现出失望和怀疑，还带着一丝难以置信。"就这样，"她平板地模仿道。她的脸随即恢复了平常那副俏皮的笑容，轻声笑了起来。

_Wow. That's—unexpected. Good for you, Third. I'm actually impressed. We'll see who's resolve lasts longer: yours or hers._ "And that worked?" Asuka asked cynically.  
哇。这真是——出乎意料。干得好，第三。我确实对你刮目相看了。我们看看谁的决心更持久：你的还是她的。"那招管用吗？" 明日香带着讽刺的口吻问道。

"He made me promise not to drink any more than once a week," she sighed. "I've already used my pass for this week. If this goes on for much longer he's going to need to find me a new, Third Child-approved, vice. But enough about that—you're coming to my party, and we're all going to have a good time."  
"他让我保证每周喝酒不超过一次，"她叹息道，"这周的额度我已经用掉了。如果这种情况持续下去，他恐怕得给我找个新的、得到三儿认可的消遣方式了。不过先不谈这个——你要来参加我的派对，我们大家都会玩得很开心的。"

_That is one of the last things I want to do._ "I'm not going if you're cooking dinner," Asuka declared.  
那是我最不想做的事情之一。“你要是做饭，我就不去了，”明日香宣布道。

"_Wwhhaaat_?" Misato asked in astonishment. "But I'm making the Katsuragi Special! Don't be rude, Asuka."  
“什——什么？”美里惊讶地问，“可我做的是葛城特餐啊！别这么没礼貌，明日香。”

The girl internally grimaced at the memory of her former guardian's cooking, both from Germany and from her "previous" time in Japan. "Instant ramen with microwavable curry is not a meal for pilots, Misato." _That's actually a good point. I'm sure NERV has a nutritionist around here somewhere; I should get the Idiot on a meal plan—and revise mine. I should've thought of that from the start._ "If you're insisting on this ("I am," Misato interjected), then make the Third cook."  
女孩回想起前监护人的厨艺，无论是来自德国还是她在日本的“前世”，内心不禁皱眉。“速食拉面配微波咖喱可不是给驾驶员吃的，美里。”这话说得倒没错。我敢肯定 NERV 某处有营养师；我该让那傻瓜制定个饮食计划——顺便调整我的。我本该一开始就想到的。“如果你坚持这样（“我坚持，”美里插话道），那就让第三适格者做饭吧。”

Misato tapped her chin in thought. "Hmm. He _is_ quite the little chef. I always look forward to the nights when it's his turn to make dinner—it's better than takeout, even! Ok, while I hate to spring this on him at the last minute, I'm sure Shinji won't mind."  
美里轻敲着下巴沉思。“嗯，他真是个小厨师。我总是期待着他做饭的夜晚——比外卖还要好，真的！好吧，虽然我不愿意在最后一刻才告诉他，但我相信真嗣不会介意的。”

"Won't mind what, Misato-san?" Asked the boy in question as he exited the locker room with his omnipresent white shirt and black slacks, his hair still slightly damp.  
“不会介意什么，美里小姐？”当事人问道，他从更衣室出来，穿着他那件常伴左右的白衬衫和黑裤子，头发还有些微湿。

"Ah, perfect timing! Come on, we're all leaving Headquarters right now!" Misato cried as she draped an arm over his shoulder. She attempted to do the same to Asuka with her other arm, but the more skillful pilot evaded capture. Undeterred, Misato led her pilots back towards the elevators.  
“啊，时机正好！快来，我们现在就离开总部！”美里喊道，一边用一只手臂搭在他的肩膀上。她试图用另一只手臂去搭明日香，但这位技术更娴熟的驾驶员巧妙地避开了。美里毫不气馁，带着她的驾驶员们向电梯走去。

"We've got a change of plans for tonight, Shinji," Misato explained as they boarded an elevator together, some of them more reluctantly than others. "Asuka informed me that she's never had your cooking before, and she just _begged_ me to let you cook tonight ("That's not what I said!" Asuka insisted) so she could, and this is a direct quote here, 'let Shinji fill me up,' ("_Misato!_ You're disgusting!" The younger woman shouted) which can really be taken in a naughty way, but I know you're above that, Shin-chan." Misato squeezed her captive pilot affectionately.  
"今晚我们的计划有变，真嗣，" 美里一边解释一边和他们一起走进电梯，有些人比其他人更不情愿。"明日香告诉我她还没尝过你做的饭，她刚刚求我让你今晚做饭（"那不是我说的！" 明日香坚持道），这样她就可以，这是直接引述，'让真嗣把我填满'（"美里！你太恶心了！" 年轻女子喊道），这真的可以有不好的理解，但我知道你不会那样，真酱。" 美里亲切地捏了捏她的俘虏驾驶员。

Both teens were blushing, with Shinji fidgeting at the combination of the teasing and the close contact, and Asuka with her back turned on the Captain and her chin turned up in indignation. _I should have known she didn't get her fill earlier. Maybe for the next Angel I can make a little detour to her favorite bar. Or her parking spot._  
两个少年都脸红了，真嗣因为挑逗和近距离接触而局促不安，而明日香则背对着上尉，下巴高昂，显得愤愤不平。我早该料到她之前没尽兴。或许下次对付使徒时，我可以顺路去她最爱的酒吧，或者她的停车位。

"For your information, Third," Asuka said icily, "I refuse to eat the radioactive waste that Misato calls food. Since she insisted that I come to this party anyway, I told her that you should cook instead."  
"告诉你，第三，" 明日香冷冷地说，"我拒绝吃美里所谓的食物，那简直是放射性废物。既然她坚持要我来参加这个派对，我就告诉她应该让你来做饭。"

"Oh. Umm, ok. I don't mind," Shinji replied hesitantly. "Misato-san, can we stop by a store on the way home? I'll need to pick some things up if I'm going to make enough food for five people." He shook his head. "Six, actually. I almost forgot Pen Pen."  
"哦。嗯，好吧。我不介意，" 真嗣犹豫地回答。"美里小姐，我们回家路上能顺便去趟商店吗？如果要给五个人做足够的食物，我需要买些东西。" 他摇了摇头。"实际上是六个人。我差点忘了企鹅 Pen Pen。"

_Six? Who's going to be at this thing? Kaji, most likely. Maybe Akagi? She's usually wrapped up in her work, but Misato did say that she had some time off today. The First?_ Asuka sneered as the elevator doors opened and the trio began to make their way to the Headquarters' exit. _No, if she were coming, I'm sure the Idiot would have volunteered to cook right from the start. He loves to pamper his doll._  
六个？谁会来这活动？多半是加持吧。也许还有赤木律子？她通常忙于工作，但美里确实说过她今天有空。第一适格者呢？真嗣轻蔑地笑了笑，电梯门打开，三人开始向总部出口走去。不，如果她要来，我敢肯定那个白痴会从一开始就自告奋勇做饭。他喜欢宠着他的洋娃娃。

"Sure thing, Shinji," Misato told him, finally releasing him from her grip as the band approached her vehicle and piled into it.  
“当然，真嗣。”美里对他说道，终于松开了他的手，乐队成员们走近她的车，纷纷挤了进去。

"Will Kaji be there?" Asuka asked as she settled into the front seat and Misato started the car.  
“加治会在那儿吗？”明日香一边问着，一边坐进副驾驶座，美里启动了汽车。

"Ugh, _yes_," the woman replied. She maneuvered her vehicle out from her parking space and towards the train that would ferry them to the surface. "He was skulking around Rits' office when I went down there yesterday to invite her. He _of course_ invited himself." She curled her lip in disgust as they were carried out of the Geofront. "I swear, he's incorrigible," she grumbled.  
“呃，是的，”美里回答道。她驾驶着车辆从停车位驶出，向着将他们送往地面的列车前进。“昨天我下楼去邀请律子时，他就在她办公室附近徘徊。他当然自告奋勇地跟来了。”当他们被载出地底都市时，她厌恶地卷起嘴唇。“我发誓，他真是无可救药，”她咕哝着。

_Well, I was right. Though it's not like there's many people she would invite anyway. Certainly not that Hyuga guy who follows her around like a puppy._ Misato continued to mutter about Kaji's various faults and deficiencies, with Shinji making appropriate "yes I am definitely listening to you and am invested in this conversation" noises from the backseat as needed, freeing Asuka to brood quietly.  
好吧，我猜对了。不过她也没多少人可以邀请。当然不会是那个像小狗一样跟着她的日向。美里继续喋喋不休地数落着加治的各种缺点和不足，而真嗣在后座适时发出“我确实在听你说话，并且很关心这个话题”的声音，让明日香得以安静地沉思。

_And who does she think she's fooling with this complaining about Kaji? If she didn't want him to come, she would have told him to fuck off. So immature. Stop pretending you hate him when you obviously still have feelings for him.  
她以为用抱怨加持就能骗过谁呢？如果真不想让他来，早就会叫他滚蛋了。真是幼稚。别装作你讨厌他，明明你还对他有感情。_

Ω

Asuka sat at the kitchen table in the Katsuragi apartment. She was holding the household's penguin in her lap and absentmindedly petting the smooth feathers down along his head and neck, causing him to produce quiet, contented _wark_ing sounds, while she watched Shinji finish preparing the last of the evening's meal to come. Under her gaze, the boy began to prepare serving dishes and take various plates and bowls out from the cupboards. When he turned to the table with his load of dishes, he smiled softly at the sight of the girl who quickly averted her eyes when she had noticed him turn around.  
明日香坐在葛城公寓的厨房桌旁，怀里抱着家里的企鹅，心不在焉地顺着它的头颈抚摸着光滑的羽毛，引得它发出满足的低沉呜呜声。她一边看着真嗣完成晚餐的最后准备。在她的注视下，少年开始准备餐具，从橱柜里取出各种盘子和碗。当他端着一摞餐具转向桌子时，看到女孩迅速移开目光，他温柔地笑了。

"He really likes you," Shinji commented as he began to set each place at the table.  
"他真的很喜欢你，"真嗣边说边开始在桌子上摆放餐具。

The girl looked down at the bird, who appeared to be sleeping. _I suppose I did kind of miss him_, she mused as she gently roused him and placed him on the ground. "I think he just likes attention," Asuka said to Shinji, which Pen Pen _wark_ed in response to before heading into his personal freezer unit.  
女孩低头看着那只鸟，它似乎在睡觉。我想我确实有点想念他了，她一边轻柔地唤醒它，一边将它放在地上。“我觉得他只是喜欢被关注，”明日香对真嗣说，而 Pen Pen 则以一声“wark”回应，随后朝着自己的私人冷冻室走去。

"Maybe," Shinji answered. "Um, I wanted to ask you something. Sorry," he continued as he finished placing the last of the dishes on the table.  
“也许吧，”真嗣回答。“呃，我想问你件事。抱歉，”他继续说着，将最后几个盘子摆放在桌上。

_Ugh, just ask! You can stand up to Misato and her drinking habits, but you have to dance around asking me a question?_ "And?" Asuka pressed.  
“哎，直接问吧！你能面对美里和她那喝酒的习惯，却在我面前绕弯子问问题？“然后呢？”明日香追问。

"How, uh, did you know that I can cook?" He asked her as he turned back to the counter and began putting food into serving dishes.  
“呃，你怎么知道我会做饭的？”他一边问她，一边转身回到料理台前，开始将食物装盘。

_Shit. Did he not mention something about cooking? It's been almost two weeks; I can just play it off like I heard it from someone._ "Misato must have mentioned it at some point," Asuka explained casually as she leaned her elbows on the table. "But really, even if you couldn't cook, whatever you made would still be preferable to what she calls food."  
该死。他是不是提到过做饭的事？已经快两周了；我可以假装是从别人那里听来的。'美里肯定在某一刻提到过，'明日香随意地解释着，将手肘撑在桌上。'但说真的，即使你不会做饭，你做的任何东西都比她所谓的食物要好。'

The boy nodded his head in agreement and mumbled something under his breath that Asuka did not hear. Simultaneously, the apartment's doorbell rang.  
男孩点头表示同意，嘴里咕哝着什么，明日香没听清楚。与此同时，公寓的门铃响了。

"I'll get it!" Misato declared from within her bedroom. The teens caught a glimpse of her as she dashed to the entryway, having changed into a loose yellow t-shirt and very short shorts. Shinji had just finished putting the last of the food out on the table. "Nice timing, Shin-chan!" She called as she passed by.  
“我去开！”美里从卧室里喊道。两个年轻人瞥见她冲向门口，换上了一件宽松的黄色 T 恤和极短的短裤。真嗣刚把最后一道菜摆上桌。“时机正好，真嗣君！”她经过时喊道。

She promptly returned to the kitchen area with two guests in tow, Kaji giving the occupants a grin and a "Hi kids," and Akagi brushing her hand up in a small wave.  
她迅速带着两位客人回到厨房区域，加持向在场的人咧嘴一笑，招呼道：“嗨，孩子们。”而赤木则轻轻挥了挥手。

"Sit down, sit down!" Misato rushed them as she quickly took her own seat at the table. "Shinji's just finished getting everything ready."

"So we won't be subjected to the Katsuragi Special after all?" Akagi asked as she settled into a seat beside Misato, who sat at the head of the table.  
"这么说我们终究不会吃到葛城特制了？" 赤木律子一边问，一边在美里旁边的座位上坐下，美里坐在桌子的首位。

"_Some people_ are ungrateful critics and wanted Shinji to cook instead," Misato replied haughtily as Kaji slipped into the seat across from Ritsuko, between Asuka and Misato. He flashed a grin at Asuka as he sat down.  
"有些人就是不知感恩的批评家，想让真嗣来做饭，" 美里傲慢地回答，与此同时，加持在律子对面、明日香和美里之间的座位上坐下。他坐下时向明日香露出了一个微笑。

"I suppose some people's palates aren't prepared to handle your brand of cooking, Katsuragi," he said with conciliation.  
"我想有些人的味蕾还没准备好接受你的烹饪风格，葛城，" 他带着和解的语气说道。

"Nobody asked you," Misato grumbled with a frown as she slapped Kaji's hand away, which he had extended to hold the one she was resting on the table.  
“没人问你，”美里皱着眉头咕哝道，一巴掌拍开了加持伸过来想握住她放在桌上的手。

Shinji was the last to take his seat after ensuring that Pen Pen had gotten several small fishes for his dinner, sitting down across from Asuka and next to Akagi. Once everyone had begun eating, after the traditional thanking for the food was given with varying levels of enthusiasm, the three adults kept up a lively discussion that Kaji kept shifting towards work-related topics, much to Misato's chagrin. Asuka did not participate in the talks herself, but paid attention to what Akagi had to say about the work being done on the last Angel's core; it was a project she hadn't heard much about, with her efforts mainly directed towards the Evas and the Pilots themselves.  
在确认了 Pen Pen 晚餐得到了几条小鱼后，真嗣最后一个落座，坐在了明日香对面、赤木律子旁边。大家开始用餐后，在以不同程度的热情完成了对食物的传统感谢之后，三位成年人展开了一场热烈的讨论，而加持不断将话题转向工作相关的内容，这让美里颇为不悦。明日香没有参与谈话，但她留意着赤木律子关于最后一个使徒核心工作的发言；这是一个她了解不多的项目，她的主要精力都集中在 EVA 和驾驶员本身上。

_Most of what she's saying they've found out should have already been known,_ she picked at the food in front of her while Akagi spoke about some of the characteristics of the material the core was made out of. _This is all the same as it is for the Evas—which makes sense, all things considered. She's probably sitting on most of what they're finding, if anything. No telling who's listening, after all._  
她所说的大部分内容，他们发现本应早已知晓，她一边拨弄着面前的食物，一边听赤木讲述核心材料的一些特性。这些都与 EVA 的情况相同——考虑到所有因素，这很合理。如果有什么发现，她很可能掌握着大部分信息。毕竟，谁知道有没有人在偷听呢。

Asuka looked up from her meal and caught Shinji's eyes as he cast quick glances at the occupants of the table, seemingly at a loss for anything to say despite a desire to participate in the conversation. As the food on the table dwindled, as did the conversation, Asuka noted Shinji's increased disappointment at not being able to join in. Asuka sighed internally, looked back down at the remains of her food, and up again to Shinji. _Don't say I never did anything for you, Idiot._  
明日香从餐盘中抬起头，捕捉到真嗣快速扫视桌旁人的眼神，尽管他似乎很想加入对话，却一时找不到话题。随着桌上食物的减少，谈话也渐渐稀少，明日香注意到真嗣因无法参与而愈发失望。明日香内心叹了口气，低头看向剩下的食物，又抬头望向真嗣。别说我从没为你做过什么，笨蛋。

"This food is pretty good, Third," she said before taking another bite. _He was always at least useful enough for that._ He had prepared a rather standard-looking meal to Asuka's still not overly fond of Japanese food eye: grilled fish, rice, miso soup, and some kind of chicken and eggplant dish—none of which she could name in Japanese.  
“这顿饭挺不错的，三郎。”她边说边又咬了一口。他至少在这方面还算有用。他准备了一顿看起来相当普通的饭菜，对仍不太喜欢日本料理的明日香来说：烤鱼、米饭、味噌汤，还有一道鸡肉和茄子的菜——她一个也说不上来用日语怎么叫。

"That's right!" Misato yelled, eager for a topic outside of work. "You know, I always tell him," she said, turning to Akagi, "he's going to make some girl very happy. Not many men can cook."  
"没错！" 美里喊道，渴望一个与工作无关的话题。"你知道的，我总是告诉他，" 她转向赤木，"他会把某个女孩宠得很幸福。没几个男人会做饭。"

"Th-thanks," Shinji said, blushing at the praise but smiling at Asuka.  
"谢、谢谢，" 真嗣说道，因夸奖而脸红，但对明日香微笑。

"Can you cook other kinds of stuff too, or just this kind of food?" Asuka asked him. _Might as well see about that diet plan._  
"你还会做其他种类的食物吗，还是只做这种？" 明日香问他。不妨看看那个饮食计划。

"You mean like Western kind of stuff? Um, I guess so? I would just have to follow a recipe for something I don't know how to make already. Right? Did you have something in mind?" His curiosity showed in his voice, though there was a touch of trepidation on his face.  
“你是说像西式的东西？嗯，我想是吧？我只需要按照一个我不懂怎么做的食谱来做就行。对吧？你心里有想好的吗？”他的声音中透露出好奇，尽管脸上带着一丝犹豫。

"Doctor Akagi, I know it's not really your field, but do you know if there's a nutritionist wandering around Headquarters?" Asuka asked the woman sitting next to her.  
"赤城医生，我知道这并非你的专业领域，但你是否知道总部附近有没有营养师出没？"明日香向坐在她身旁的女性问道。

"Yes, I'm sure there's one hiding somewhere." She raised an eyebrow at the girl, while Misato put her face in her hands at the conversation turning back towards work, only looking up to glare at Kaji as he tried to play footsie with her under the table. "That's not a bad thought, actually. Poke around the medical section, you'll find someone there."

"I thought you already had a meal plan, Asuka?" Kaji asked her, tearing his eyes away from Misato's hateful gaze to smile at the girl.  
"我以为你已经有饮食计划了，明日香？" 加持问道，将目光从美里那充满恨意的眼神中移开，转向女孩微笑。

She briefly returned his smile before gesturing to Shinji. "I do, though I'd like to see about a new one; I'm sure details like my metabolic rate have changed since the last time I was evaluated. I'm more concerned about him, though." Now she indicated the food in front of her. "This dinner is all right, macros wise, but with some direction, Shinji, you can make food that will help you recover faster and stuff like that," she explained to her fellow pilot.  
她短暂地回以微笑，然后指向真嗣。"我确实有，不过我想看看有没有新的；我敢肯定，自从上次评估以来，我的新陈代谢率等细节已经发生了变化。不过，我更担心他。" 接着她指了指面前的食物。"这顿饭在宏量营养素方面还算可以，但有了一些指导，真嗣，你可以做出有助于更快恢复的食物，诸如此类，" 她向她的同僚驾驶员解释道。

"Oh, that makes sense," he said, frowning slightly and furrowing his brow in thought. "How do they know what kind of food I should eat?"  
"哦，这说得通，" 他说着，微微皱眉，眉头紧锁陷入思考。"他们怎么知道我应该吃什么食物呢？"

"You just go in and talk to them," Misato explained. "You tell them your goals, talk about what kind of exercise you do, they run some small tests, then give you a breakdown of what you should be eating," she said, noticing Shinji's frown deepen at the mention of tests. "Simple tests!" She assured him.

Asuka nodded in agreement. "I'll take you myself, Third," she told him. "I'll want to make sure they know what my training plan is." _And I suppose I have to bite the bullet on this one._ "And what about the First, Doctor?" She asked, quirking her head at the woman next to her.  
明日香点头表示同意。“我亲自带你去，三号，”她对他说，“我得确保他们明白我的训练计划。”我想我得硬着头皮上了。“那医生，一号怎么办？”她歪着头问身旁的女人。

"Ah, that reminds me," Ritsuko said as she pulled a card from her purse. "Ayanami is officially back on duty now. She's had the last of her bandages removed; she'll be joining your training sessions starting tomorrow. I've already cleared it with the Commander—he was intrigued by the potential benefits to pilot synch rates."  
“啊，这让我想起来了，”律子说着从手提包里抽出一张卡片。“绫波现在已经正式归队了。她最后一批绷带也拆掉了；从明天开始，她会加入你们的训练。我已经和司令沟通过了——他对提高驾驶员同步率的可能性很感兴趣。”

"That's great news!" Misato said. "Professor Soryu gets one more student!"  
“这真是好消息！”美里说道。“惣流教授又多了一个学生！”

_Ok, just ignore her._ "Do I need to make any accommodations for her?"  
好了，别理她。“我需要为她做些什么准备吗？”

"No, your current schedule works for her just fine," Akagi assured her. "As for taking her to a nutritionist, go right ahead. Just clear any dietary plans through me before you implement them. And do me a favor," Ritsuko said, handing the card she was holding to Asuka. "Take this to Ayanami on your way back tonight? She's got an activation test with Unit 00 tomorrow morning, and her old ID was deactivated before I could get her this one."  
“不，你目前的日程对她来说正合适。”赤木律子向她保证道，“至于带她去看营养师，尽管去吧。只是实施任何饮食计划前，先跟我通个气。还有，帮我个忙，”说着，律子将手中的卡片递给明日香，“今晚回去的路上把这个交给绫波吧？她明天早上要进行零号机的启动测试，而她的旧 ID 在我拿到这张之前就被停用了。”

Asuka took the card and glanced at the address on it. _That's not a part of town I've ever been to,_ she thought. _I didn't even know people lived there. I thought it was unfinished construction._ "Sure, Doctor," she told her. _Just pawn off the undesirable tasks to me; just like taking care of the Idiot._  
明日香接过卡片，瞥了一眼上面的地址。那可不是我去过的街区，她心想。我甚至不知道那里有人居住。我还以为那只是未完工的建筑呢。“当然，博士，”她回答道。把棘手的任务推给我；就像照顾那个白痴一样。

"That's hardly on the way back to the Geofront, Rits," Kaji admonished the doctor. "I'll drive you, kiddo, and I'll make sure you get back to your place, too."  
“那可不在回地下的路上，理津，”加持责备医生道。“我开车送你，小家伙，我也会确保你安全回到住处的。”

_Eh? That's weird, coming from you, Kaji. I'd usually have to beg for treatment like that. Though I suppose a gentleman would never let a lady travel alone at night.  
诶？这话从你嘴里说出来真奇怪，加持。我通常得求你才肯这么照顾我。不过我想，一个绅士绝不会让女士在夜里独自旅行。_

"Um, sorry, do you mind if I come too, Kaji-san?" Shinji asked the man next to him.  
“呃，抱歉，我可以也一起来吗，加持先生？”真嗣向身旁的男人问道。

_And of course, the Third just absolutely_ must _take every opportunity to see his precious Ayanami._  
当然，第三适格者总是要抓住每一个机会去看他珍爱的绫波。

"Of course you can come," Kaji turned his grin to the boy. "You've been spending time with the First Child at school, right? You want to check on her?"  
"当然你可以来，"加持转向男孩，露出笑容。"你在学校一直和初号机驾驶员在一起，对吧？你想去看看她吗？"

Shinji blushed at the comment but met Kaji's gaze. "She's, uh, well, I think we're friends. We don't talk much, but when I do ask her something she usually answers. Which is more than what she does with other people." He looked back down at his food. "Actually, what Asuka said before made me worried about Ayanami-san's diet. I rarely see her eat at school, so I want to bring her some leftovers. And show her how to store and pack them properly."  
真嗣因这番话而脸红，但还是迎上了加持的目光。"她，呃，嗯，我想我们是朋友。我们不怎么说话，但当我问她问题时，她通常会回答。这比她对其他人做的要多。"他低头看着自己的食物。"实际上，之前明日香说的话让我担心绫波的饮食。我在学校很少见她吃东西，所以我想给她带些剩菜。并教她如何正确储存和打包。"

A deeply mischievous grin worked its way onto Misato's face while Asuka quietly _huff_ed and finished off the last of her food. "That's awfully sweet of you, Shin-chan," Misato said in a voice that dripped with honey. "Just completely adorable, but you really do need to watch yourself; cooking for two girls is—"  
一个深藏不露的顽皮笑容爬上了美里脸上，而明日香则静静地哼了一声，吃完了最后一点食物。"你真是太贴心了，真嗣君，"美里用甜腻的声音说道。"真是可爱极了，但你真的需要注意；为两个女孩做饭可是——"

"After all!" Shinji quickly spoke over her before she could finish. "Asuka is making sure that I'm in proper piloting condition, so we should do the same for Ayanami-san, right?" He cast his gaze around searching for an ally, but Kaji was too bemused, Akagi too above it all, and Asuka too ignoring him to offer any respite. He endured the next several moments of Misato making lascivious remarks with decidedly very little grace.  
“毕竟！” 真嗣赶在明日香说完之前迅速插话，“明日香在确保我处于良好的驾驶状态，那我们也该为绫波做同样的事，对吧？”他环顾四周寻找支持者，但加持太过困惑，律子太过超然，而明日香则完全无视他，没有一人伸出援手。他忍受了接下来几分钟美里满是挑逗的言论，表现得相当不自在。

_Make your excuses, we all know everyone prefers the docile First Child to the bitchy Second Child._ Asuka looked up to Kaji, standing from her place at the table. "Can we go now, Kaji? I don't want to be out too late," she said in a mostly successful likeness of pleasantness.  
找借口吧，我们都知道大家更喜欢温顺的长女，而不是那个泼辣的次女。明日香抬头望向加持，从桌边站起身来。“我们可以走了吗，加持？我不想在外面待得太晚。”她尽量装出愉快的样子说道。

"Sure thing," Kaji replied as he stood up himself, bending to take Misato's hand for one last affectionate kiss across her knuckles. She shooed his hand away. "We wouldn't want to keep Ayanami waiting on her dinner any longer, would we, Shinji?" He asked as the boy in question also rose and began piling up empty dishes and taking them to the sink.  
“当然，”加持应道，自己也站起身来，弯腰握住美里手，在她指节上留下一个深情的吻。美里挥手赶开了他。“我们可不想让绫波等她的晚餐太久，对吧，真嗣？”他问道，而话题中的少年也站了起来，开始收拾空盘子，把它们端到水槽去。

"I'll be just a second, Kaji-san," he told him. "Misato-san, I'll wash these when I get back, so don't touch—I mean, don't worry about them, ok?"  
"我马上就好，加持先生。" 他对他说。"美里小姐，我回来会洗这些的，所以别碰——我是说，别担心它们，好吗？"

"You got it!" Misato smiled at Ritsuko as Asuka and Kaji made their way towards the entryway and Shinji began preparing some containers of food. "Isn't he the best, Rits?"  
"你明白的！" 美里对律子笑着，此时明日香和加持正走向门口，而真嗣开始准备一些食物容器。"他是不是最棒的，律子？"

"He certainly seems to be the roommate you needed," she answered. "I don't know how I got through those years in university living with you," she said, smiling fondly.  
"他确实看起来是你需要的室友，" 她回答道。"我不知道我是怎么熬过大学那些年和你一起住的，" 她微笑着，带着一丝怀念。

"You were enamored with my wonderful personality and amazing social skills, both of which you were severely lacking," Misato chuckled.  
"你被我迷人的个性和出色的社交技巧迷住了，这两样你都严重缺乏，" 美里轻声笑道。

"Ah, is that what you called it when you and Kaji didn't leave your bed for a—"  
“啊，这就是你们称之为和加持在床上厮混一整天的事吗？”

"Ok! That's enough of that!" Misato yelped, flustered. "Shinji, Asuka, you guys all set?" The teens replied in the affirmative, Shinji making his way towards the apartment door with his arms full of food containers, Asuka already leaning against the doorway waiting for him. "Good. Kaji, you take them to Ayanami's, then straight back home. Got it? No funny business," she scolded. "I don't want to read any Section Two reports about you three joyriding around the city or something."  
"好了！到此为止！" 美里慌张地喊道，"真嗣，明日香，你们准备好了吗？" 两个少年肯定地回应，真嗣双手抱着一堆食物容器朝公寓门口走去，明日香已经靠在门框上等着他。"很好。加持，你带他们去绫波那里，然后直接回家。明白吗？别搞什么花样，" 她警告道，"我不想看到第二科的报告说你们三个在城里兜风之类的。"

"Whatever you say, Katsuragi," the man replied as he ushered the kids out of the apartment. "Goodbye, ladies," he called out behind him, the Pilots offering their own goodbyes. _What kind of nonsense does Misato think we'd get up to anyway?_ Asuka thought as the two women returned their goodbyes.

Ω

The ride to the First Child's residence had been quiet, with Kaji happy to smoke and drive in contemplative silence which left Asuka to consider how to handle her first real interaction with Ayanami in what was, for her, likely "months," and left Shinji to concern himself with keeping his containers from getting knocked around in the car.  
前往第一适格者住处的路上异常安静，加持乐得一边抽烟一边沉思，留下明日香思索如何应对她与绫波的首次真正接触——对她而言，这或许是“数月”以来的第一次；而真嗣则忙着确保车上的容器不被颠簸摇晃。

_Should I just ask her to be friends again? Try to start over?_ Asuka sighed to herself. _Maybe we could be friends—like I was with Hikari. Except Ayanami actually understands what it means to be a pilot. Or at least, theoretically she does. I just need to get her to stop acting so insufferably holier-than-thou!_  
我应该直接问她要不要重新做朋友吗？试着重新开始？明日香暗自叹息。也许我们可以成为朋友——就像我和光那样。只不过绫波实际上理解作为驾驶员的意义。或者至少，理论上她懂。我只是需要让她停止表现得那么令人难以忍受的高高在上！

Asuka grimaced as Kaji pulled into a parking spot in front of an apartment building that looked like it should have been condemned a long time ago. The group had passed by increasingly inhospitable looking buildings as they got closer to their destination, but Asuka had not been expecting the building to look quite so bad. _I feel like I need a tetanus shot just from looking at it_, she thought as she got out of the car. Kaji followed suit, opening the back door for Shinji to get out without having to drop his prize.  
当加持把车停在一栋看起来早该被拆除的公寓楼前时，明日香皱起了眉头。随着他们接近目的地，沿途的建筑物越来越显得破败不堪，但明日香没想到这栋楼会糟糕到这种程度。她下车时心想，光是看一眼这楼，我都觉得自己需要打一针破伤风疫苗。加持也下了车，为真嗣打开后门，让他不用放下手中的奖品就能下车。

"You kids go on ahead," Kaji said as he scanned around the surrounding buildings. "I'm going to have a chat with some of the Section Two guys around here. I'll be up shortly if you're not back before I'm done."  
"你们先走吧，" 加持一边环顾四周的建筑一边说道，"我要和这里的第二支部的人聊聊。如果你们在我结束前还没回来，我随后就上去。"

"Sure, Kaji," Asuka said, hurriedly walking toward what she figured to be the main entrance; it was hard to tell with few working lights anywhere on the exterior of the building, and even fewer in the interior that she could tell from the outside. "Come on, Third," she instructed the boy as he walked dutifully behind her.  
“当然，加持，”明日香说着，快步走向她推测是主入口的地方；由于建筑物外部的照明寥寥无几，内部更是从外面难以辨认，灯光稀少。“快点，第三适格者，”她指示着男孩，他则忠实地跟在她身后。

Opening the front door revealed a lobby that looked mostly abandoned; grime covered every surface that Asuka could see, the tiled floor was ripped up in some parts, more than half the light fixtures were dark, and the single elevator was marked out of order.  
推开前门，映入眼帘的是一个看似已被遗弃的大厅；阿斯纳能看到的地方都覆盖着污垢，瓷砖地板有些部分已经破损，超过一半的灯具不亮，唯一的一部电梯也贴着故障的标记。

_What kind of place is this?_ Asuka thought as she made her way inside after holding the door open for her fellow with the otherwise occupied arms. "Looks like we're taking the stairs," she remarked to Shinji.  
这是什么地方？明日香一边想着，一边为那位双手不得空闲的同伴扶着门，走了进去。“看来我们得爬楼梯了。”她对真嗣说道。

"Right," he said, heading towards an open entryway near the main entrance with a flickering light inside which showed a staircase.  
“好，”他说着，朝主入口附近一个闪烁着灯光的开放入口走去，灯光显示里面有一段楼梯。

Asuka took the lead up the stairs, frowning in disgust at the disrepair of the building in general as they made their way to the First Child's floor. _These stairs seem fine, they're just concrete, but the railings might as well not be here!_ She had tentatively placed her hand on one of the unpainted, rusted railings, and found it to be barely affixed to the ground. "Watch your step, Idiot," she said idly while she climbed the stairs.  
明日香带头走上楼梯，对整栋建筑的破败状况皱眉表示厌恶，他们正前往第一适格者的楼层。这些楼梯看起来还行，只是混凝土的，但扶手几乎等于不存在！她试探性地将手放在一根未上漆、生锈的扶手上，发现它几乎没固定在地上。“小心点，白痴，”她一边爬楼梯一边漫不经心地说。

Once the pair arrived at the landing for Ayanami's floor, Asuka gladly lead Shinji into the hall away from the stairs—but it was hardly an improvement to where they had come from. _Why the hell would anyone live here?_ She thought to herself as she picked her way down the mostly unlit outdoor hallway around piles of garbage. _At least the outside air keeps the smell down._  
两人到达绫波的楼层后，明日香欣然领着真嗣离开楼梯，进入走廊——但这并不比他们来的地方好多少。她心想，这里怎么会有人住？她小心翼翼地穿过堆满垃圾、大部分未照明的户外走廊。至少外面的空气让气味不那么难闻。

"This is it," she announced as they came up to Ayanami's door. She noted that there was at least no refuse piled in front of it, like some of the other doors had, though it was just as grimy and battered looking as its neighbors. She reached out for the doorbell and pressed on it, but it did not ring.  
“就是这儿了。”她宣布道，当他们走到绫波的门前。她注意到至少门前没有堆放垃圾，不像其他一些门那样，尽管它同样显得肮脏且破旧，与邻居们无异。她伸手去按门铃，但按下后却毫无声响。

"Maybe try knocking?" Shinji asked from behind her.  
“或许可以试着敲敲门？”真嗣从她身后提议道。

_Gee, thanks, I never would have thought of that, genius._ "Gee, thanks, I never would have thought of that, genius," she complained to him as she knocked on the door. Shortly after, the door opened to reveal the First Child, clad in a school uniform, and standing very close to Asuka. The pair locked eyes for a few seconds, Ayanami's blank face opposite Asuka's slightly startled one.
*哎呀，谢谢啊，我真是没想到，天才。*“哎呀，谢谢啊，我真是没想到，天才，”她一边抱怨着，一边敲了敲门。不久后，门打开了，出现的是穿着校服的第一适格者，站得离明日香很近。两人对视了几秒钟，绫波零面无表情的脸对着明日香略显惊讶的脸。

_Once again, leave it to Asuka to get things started._ "Are you going to invite us in, First?" She prompted.  
又是明日香来开场。“你打算邀请我们进去吗，First？”她催促道。

The other girl looked from one newcomer to the other. "Why would I do that?" She asked flatly.  
另一个女孩来回打量着两位新来者，平淡地问道：“我为什么要那么做？”

Fury built up in Asuka at the First Child's normal display of casual condescension. _And there it is! Why did I expect anything else from her?_ She was about to turn and leave without offering a reply but was stopped by Shinji answering the other girl's question.  
明日香对第一适任者那惯常的随意傲慢态度感到怒火中烧。果然如此！我为何还期待她会有所不同？她正打算转身离去，不作任何回应，却被真嗣回答了那女孩的问题所打断。

"That's the normal thing to do when friends come over, Ayanami-san," he said over Asuka's shoulder.  
"朋友来访时这样做很正常，绫波同学。" 他越过明日香的肩膀说道。

_As if she doesn't know that, Idiot! Don't play into her superiority complex!  
好像她不知道似的，白痴！别助长她的优越感！_

The First Child once again looked between her visitors and nodded almost imperceptively. "Very well. Come in, Second, Ikari-kun." She punctuated this by promptly turning around and walking into her apartment.  
第一适格者再次在访客之间来回看了看，几乎难以察觉地点了点头。“很好。进来吧，第二适格者，碇君。”她随即转身走进自己的公寓，以此作为结束语。

_Is that really it?_ Asuka thought as she followed Ayanami inside, Shinji close behind her. _There's no way—she has to be fucking with me._ She moved to take off her shoes but stopped short of it. _This floor is just as disgusting as the rest of this building_. Instead, she headed further into the small apartment and began to take stock of the state of it.  
真的就这样吗？明日香一边想着，一边跟着绫波进了屋，真嗣紧随其后。不可能——她肯定在耍我。她本想脱鞋，但停住了。这地板和这栋楼的其它部分一样恶心。于是，她继续深入这个小公寓，开始评估它的状况。

_No, this whole apartment is as bad as the rest of this building. What the fuck, First?_ She glared around at the dilapidated furniture, peeling and mold-stained walls, broken ceiling fan, and a dirty nightstand strewn with pill bottles next to a plain metal bed frame. Shinji busied himself setting his containers of leftovers down in the tiny kitchen area which Asuka had not even begun to scrutinize yet.  
不，这整个公寓和这栋楼的其他部分一样糟糕。搞什么鬼，First？她怒视着四周破旧的家具、剥落且发霉的墙壁、损坏的吊扇，以及一张简陋的金属床架旁散落着药瓶的肮脏床头柜。真嗣忙着将他的剩菜容器放在狭小的厨房区域，而明日香甚至还没开始仔细检查。

"We brought some stuff for you. Right, Asuka?" Shinji said to Ayanami, who was watching him work with a blank expression.  
“我们给你带了些东西。对吧，明日香？”真嗣对绫波说，后者正面无表情地看着他忙碌。

"Yeah, right, this is your new ID card," Asuka said absently as she pulled the card out of her pocket, offering it to Rei. _This is no place for anyone to live. Let alone a pilot. How long has this been going on? How long_ did _it go on?_  
“是啊，对了，这是你的新身份证，”明日香心不在焉地说着，从口袋里掏出卡片递给绫波。这里根本不是人住的地方。更别说是驾驶员了。这种情况持续多久了？已经持续多久了？

Ayanami took the card, glancing briefly at Asuka before returning her attention to Shinji. "What are you doing, Ikari-kun?"  
绫波接过卡片，短暂地瞥了一眼明日香，然后将注意力转回真嗣。“你在做什么，碇君？”

"I, uh, brought you some leftovers. We had a party earlier—umm, and there was too much food? Sorry, I hope you don't mind," he said.  
“我，呃，给你带了些剩菜。我们之前开了个派对——嗯，食物太多了？抱歉，希望你不介意，”他说道。

Asuka was only tangentially paying attention to their conversation as she poked her head into the small bathroom. _Disgusting. Just like I expected. First, do you seriously not see a problem living like this?_  
明日香只是漫不经心地听着他们的对话，同时探头望向那个狭小的浴室。恶心。正如我所料。首先，你们真的不觉得这样生活有问题吗？

"I do not mind," Ayanami told him.  
“我并不介意，”绫波告诉他。

"Great," Shinji said. "Here, let's get them put away, and I'll show you how to pack them for—"  
"好极了，" 真嗣说道。"来，我们先把它们收好，然后我教你如何打包——"

"First, explain something to me," Asuka interrupted, walking angrily over to the other girl. Ayanami turned to face her, her expression unchanged.  
"首先，给我解释一下，" 明日香打断道，气冲冲地走向另一个女孩。绫波零转过身面对她，表情依旧不变。

"What is it, Second?" "什么事，二号？"

"What the hell is wrong with you? I mean, what are you, stupid?" She demanded.  
"你到底怎么回事？我是说，你是不是脑子有问题？" 她质问道。

"Asuka!" Shinji said indignantly.  
"明日香！" 真嗣愤愤不平地说道。

"Shut up, Third," Asuka growled at him without looking his way _Always trying to protect your precious doll. Well, for once, so am I_. "How do you live like this?" She yelled at Ayanami.  
"闭嘴，第三适格者，" 明日香对他咆哮道，头也不回。总是试图保护你那珍贵的玩偶。好吧，就这一次，我也是。"你怎么能这样生活？" 她对着绫波丽大喊。

"I do not understand your question," she replied calmly. "These are my assigned quarters. This is where I live."  
“我不明白你的问题，”她平静地回答，“这是我的指定住所。我住在这里。”

"And it's a fucking shithole, First!" _There's no_ way _you're ok with this! What game are you playing?!_ "No one should live here, let alone a pilot! Look!" She demanded, gesturing vaguely all around the apartment. "It's filthy, falling apart, moldy—the place is a death trap! And the rest of the building is just as bad. Worse, even! Why would you want to live here?" Shinji was now also looking around the apartment, frowning and shaking his head. _Yeah, you noticed too, Third. Why didn't you say anything? Did you think your food was enough to make up for your doll's shitty living conditions?_  
"这他妈就是个垃圾场，First！" 你不可能对这情况无动于衷！你到底在玩什么把戏？！"这里根本不适合人住，更别提一个飞行员了！看！" 她要求道，胡乱地指着整个公寓。"脏乱不堪，破败不堪，还有霉菌——这地方简直就是个死亡陷阱！而且整栋楼都一样糟糕。甚至更糟！你为什么要住在这里？" 真嗣现在也在环顾公寓，皱着眉头摇头。是啊，你也注意到了，Third。你怎么不吭声？你以为你的食物就能弥补你那娃娃糟糕的生活环境吗？

"These are my assigned quarters," Ayanami insisted again, her brows drawing ever so slightly together. "Conditions do not matter. If my ability to pilot were compromised, I could be replaced."  
"这是我的指定住所，"绫波再次坚持道，眉头微微皱起。"条件并不重要。如果我的驾驶能力受损，我可以被替换。"

_There's that bullshit again! I'm so sick of her attitude!_ "No!" Asuka told her. "I don't care what excuses you make." She pulled out her cellphone and called Misato. "I thought they liked you the best, but they stick you in this shitty building? I'm not going to stand for it." _If they treat_ you _like this, it's no wonder they just left me to die._ Finally, Misato picked up her phone.  
又是这种鬼话！我真是受够了她的态度！ "不！"明日香告诉她。"我不在乎你找什么借口。"她掏出手机给美里打电话。"我以为他们最喜欢你，结果却把你塞进这种破楼？我绝不会坐视不管。"如果他们这样对待你，难怪他们就让我自生自灭。最后，美里终于接了电话。

"Ah, Asuka? What is it? Don't tell me Kaji's gotten you guys in trouble," she began.  
“啊，明日香？怎么了？别告诉我加持又给你们惹麻烦了。”她开口道。

"No, this is serious, Misato," Asuka said darkly.  
“不，这是认真的，美里，”明日香语气沉重地说。

"Why are you always calling me at night with serious stuff to talk about," Misato sighed. "This is somehow work related, I presume?"  
“为什么你总是在晚上打电话来谈这些严肃的事情，”美里叹了口气。“这大概和工作有关吧，我猜？”

"You could say that," Asuka answered. "Have you ever been to the First Child's apartment?"  
“可以这么说，”明日香回答。“你有没有去过第一适格者的公寓？”

"Mm, no, I haven't," came the reply. "Should I have?" As the conversation went on, Shinji had begun to pick up bits and pieces of garbage littered around the kitchen area and dispose of them while Ayanami watched.  
“嗯，没有，我没听说过，”对方回答道，“我应该知道吗？”随着对话的继续，真嗣开始捡拾厨房区域散落的垃圾并进行处理，而绫波在一旁看着。

"Yes, you should have. I'll make this short, Misato: it's not fit for human habitation. Not even just the apartment; it's the whole building." Asuka glared at Ayanami as she continued to watch Shinji. _Are you going to help him clean up your home, First? Or just let him do all the work?_ While she glared, she noticed Kaji slip into the apartment's entryway. _Great. Another witness to this disaster. I can't believe I'm doing this for the First of all people._  
“是的，你本该如此。我会说得简短些，美里：这里不适合人居住。不仅仅是这间公寓；整栋楼都是如此。”明日香瞪着绫波，同时继续观察着真嗣。你会帮他打扫你的家吗，一号？还是只让他一个人做所有的工作？在她瞪视的同时，她注意到加持悄悄溜进了公寓的入口。太好了。又多了一个见证这场灾难的人。我真不敢相信我居然为了一个一号做这种事。

"Not fit for—what do you mean, Asuka?" Misato's tone had turned serious.
“不适合——你什么意思，明日香？”美里语气变得严肃起来。

"I mean that I wouldn't house the lowest scum of the earth in this shithole. I mean that it's a miracle Ayanami isn't riddled with diseases and open sores at all times. I mean—"  
"我的意思是，我绝不会让地球上最卑劣的渣滓住进这个狗窝。我是说，绫波能不随时满身疾病和溃烂伤口，简直就是个奇迹。我是说——"

"Ok, I think I get it," Misato interrupted. She sighed heavily into the phone. "All right. Not to say I don't believe you, but I'm coming over right now to evaluate the situation for myself."  
"好吧，我想我明白了，"美里打断道。她在电话那头重重地叹了口气。"好吧。不是我不相信你，但我现在就过去亲自评估一下情况。"

"Fine," Asuka said. "Get here quickly."  
"好，"明日香说。"快点过来。"

"You know I will," Misato assured her. With that, Asuka placed her phone away and turned to face Kaji fully. "Misato is on her way. I told her that Ayanami can't live here anymore."  
"你知道我会来的，" 美里向她保证。说完，明日香把手机收好，完全转向面对加持。"美里正在赶来。我告诉她绫波不能再住在这里了。"

Kaji was leaning against one wall, apparently unconcerned with the prospect of dirtying his clothes on contact with the grimy surface. "I think I agree with your assessment, Asuka," he informed her. "Ayanami, what do you think?"  
加持靠在一面墙上，显然并不在意自己的衣服会因接触肮脏的墙面而弄脏。"我认为你的判断没错，明日香，" 他告诉她。"绫波，你怎么看？"

The First Child looked away from Shinji's cleaning efforts to stare at Kaji. Asuka noticed a small shift in her facial features when she did so. _What was that? Is she angry? That's the most I've ever seen her emote._  
第一使徒从真嗣的清洁工作中移开视线，转而盯着加持。明日香注意到她的面部表情有细微的变化。那是什么？她在生气吗？这是我见过的她情绪最明显的一次。

"I live where I am ordered to live," she replied with just a touch more aloofness than Asuka was used to hearing in her voice.  
“我住在被命令居住的地方。”她回答道，语气中带着一丝比明日香惯常所闻更为疏离的冷淡。

_I think she_ is _angry. But why? I'm helping her out, here._ "Well, when Misato gets here, I'm sure you'll be ordered to live somewhere else," Asuka said in a huff. "Shinji, stop cleaning. That's a waste of time; she's not going to be here after a few more hours."  
我觉得她是生气了。但为什么呢？我在这里可是帮她的忙。“好吧，等美里来了，我肯定你会被命令搬到别的地方去，”明日香气呼呼地说。“真嗣，别打扫了。那是浪费时间；她再过几个小时就不在这里了。”

The boy stood up and looked around the apartment, seemingly at a loss for what to do. "Um—have you eaten dinner, Ayanami-san?" He asked her, gesturing at the leftovers he had brought.  
男孩站起身，环顾着公寓，似乎不知所措。“呃——你吃过晚饭了吗，绫波同学？”他向她问道，指了指自己带来的剩菜。

"I have not," she informed him as she turned back to face him.  
“我还没吃，”她转过身来面对他，告诉他。

"Ok," he said with a small smile. "Well, the food should still be warm," he said as he washed his hands and began to open up some of the containers. "There's grilled fish, rice, miso soup, and—"  
"好的，" 他带着一丝微笑说道。"嗯，食物应该还是温的，" 他边说边洗着手，开始打开一些容器。"有烤鱼、米饭、味噌汤，还有——"

"I do not eat meat," Rei said flatly, looking into one of the containers.  
"我不吃肉，" 丽平静地说道，目光投向其中一个容器。

_Way to be ungrateful, First.  
真是不知感恩，First。_

"That's ok," Shinji said, as he began going through the cupboards searching for something to put the food on. Finding a bowl he deemed sufficient, he offered it to Ayanami who took it carefully in her hands. Asuka caught sight of their hands briefly touching as the dish was exchanged, and she made her way over to the nightstand to investigate the bottles haphazardly strewn about it. "Just eat what you like, and next time I'll know what not to make for you," he said bashfully.  
"没关系，" 真嗣说着，开始翻找橱柜，寻找能盛放食物的东西。找到一个他认为足够大的碗后，他递给绫波，她小心翼翼地接过。明日香瞥见他们在交换碗时手指短暂相触，便走向床头柜，查看那些随意散落的瓶子。"随便吃你喜欢的东西吧，下次我就知道不该给你做什么了，" 他有些害羞地说。

_I know some of these,_ Asuka thought as her annoyance gave way to curiosity. _Some pain medications, antibiotics, normal stuff for someone who was just covered in bandages. But I don't even recognize most of this stuff. Even with the extra practice with my Kanji._  
我知道其中一些，明日香心想，她的恼怒被好奇心所取代。一些止痛药、抗生素，对于一个浑身缠满绷带的人来说是常备品。但我甚至认不出大部分这些东西。即使我额外练习了我的汉字。

"This will be sufficient," she heard Ayanami says, accompanied by the sounds of food being scooped into a bowl.  
“这样就够了。”她听到绫波说，伴随着食物被舀进碗里的声音。

Asuka's focus was interrupted by Kaji placing a hand on her shoulder and peering over her head at the prescriptions she was investigating. "That's quite the drug regimen," he commented.  
明日香的关注被加持放在她肩上的手打断，他越过她的头顶看向她正在研究的处方。“这药量可不小，”他评论道。

Asuka turned to face him, seeing Ayanami sipping soup out of a ceramic mug out of the corner of her eye. "Yeah. But she did just get out of the hospital. That's kind of normal, right?"  
明日香转过身面对他，眼角瞥见绫波正从一个陶瓷杯中啜饮汤。“是啊。但她刚出院。这挺正常的，对吧？”

"Hmm," Kaji replied, picking up one of the bottles to take a closer look at it. "Maybe," he said, placing it back down. Any further comments he had to make were shut down by the sound of the front door opening, Misato strolling in.  
“嗯，”加持回答，拿起其中一个瓶子仔细查看。“也许吧，”他说着把它放回原处。他本想进一步评论，但前门打开的声音打断了他，美里走了进来。

"Sorry I took so long. I realized I forgot to ask where you live, Ayanami, so I had to call up Section Two for your address."  
“抱歉花了这么久。我意识到忘了问你住哪儿，绫波，所以只好打电话给第二部门要你的地址。”

_Misato, you got here in less than ten minutes! How fast were you driving? Whatever.  
美里，你不到十分钟就赶到了！你开得有多快啊？算了。_

"So you see what I'm getting at, then?" Asuka asked her, stepping away from Kaji to stand in front of Misato with her arms crossed. Ayanami had not looked up from her meal, seemingly at ease with people barging into her apartment.  
“所以你明白我的意思了吧？”明日香问她，从加持身边走开，站在美里面前，双臂交叉。绫波并没有从她的餐盘中抬起头，似乎对人们闯入她的公寓毫不在意。

Misato took a careful look around the room, taking in the decay surrounding her. "Yes, I suppose I do," she said reluctantly, sighing deeply.  
美里仔细环视了一下房间，感受着周围的衰败。“是的，我想我明白了，”她不情愿地说道，深深叹了口气。

"And?" Asuka pressed her.  
"然后呢？" 明日香追问道。

"And, yes, I agree, she shouldn't stay here. What do you think, Ayanami?"  
"是的，我同意，她不应该留在这里。你觉得呢，绫波？"

The First Child glanced up at Misato, a bite of food halfway to her lips. "I live where I am ordered to live, Ma'am," she said simply before resuming her meal.  
第一适格者抬头看向美里，食物刚送到嘴边。“我住在被命令住的地方，长官。”她简单地回答，然后继续用餐。

"Um, right," Misato said with a slightly confused expression. "Well, it's a process, so tomorrow I'll—"  
“呃，好的，”美里带着些许困惑的表情说，“这是个过程，所以明天我会——”

"No," Asuka said hotly. "Tonight." _I don't care how shitty the First is, no one deserves to be treated like this._  
“不，”明日香激动地说，“今晚。”我才不管第一适格者有多糟糕，没人应该被这样对待。

"Asuka, it takes time to make things like this happen. I'm already prepared to catch flak from the Commander for demanding a move on short notice—"  
"明日香，这种事情是需要时间的。我已经准备好因为临时要求调动而受到指挥官的责难——"

"So why does it matter if it's just a little bit of a shorter notice?" Asuka demanded. "Who cares about getting stupid paperwork started? You can do that later. The First needs better living conditions _now_, not tomorrow. You've got a spare bedroom—just have her stay there until you can work out something permanent."  
"那为什么稍微提前一点通知就不行呢？" 明日香质问道。"谁在乎那些繁琐的文书工作？你可以之后再处理。一之濑现在就需要更好的居住条件，不是明天。你不是有空余的卧室吗——就让她暂时住在那里，直到你能安排一个长期的解决方案。"

Misato gave her a skeptical look, taking her chin into her hand in thought. "Well, it's more of a storage closet, really," she said quietly. She shook her head. "All right," came the Captain voice as she pointed at Shinji and Rei. "Ayanami, once you're done eating, pack a bag with a few days' worth of supplies. Shinji, you help her. Kaji will drive you back home once you're done; he'll help you set up the spare room for Rei."  
Misato 带着怀疑的神情，用手托着下巴沉思。“嗯，其实更像是个储藏室，”她轻声说道。她摇了摇头。“好吧，”随着她指向真嗣和丽，用队长的口吻说道，“绫波，吃完饭后，收拾一个装有几天份物资的包。真嗣，你帮她。完成后，Kaji 会开车送你们回家；他会帮你们在备用房间里安顿好绫波。”

She stepped over to Kaji and gave him a stern look, poking him in the chest. "You take care of them, ok? Stay with them tonight, I'm going to be busy at the office."  
她走到加持身边，严肃地看了他一眼，戳了戳他的胸口。“你要照顾好他们，好吗？今晚就陪着他们，我办公室那边会很忙。”

"Anything for you, Katsuragi," he smiled at her, affectionately holding the hand she had thrust at his chest between his own hands. She grimaced in response but did not struggle against his grip.  
"为了你，葛城。" 他微笑着，深情地握住她伸向他胸膛的手，夹在自己的双手之间。她皱了皱眉回应，但没有挣扎他的握力。

"Asuka, you come with me back to the Geofront." Orders issued, she wrenched her hand out of Kaji's and began walking out of the apartment. Asuka followed behind her, sparing a glance at Shinji and the First. The boy was standing with a rather dumbstruck look on his face, while the girl was quietly finishing her meal.  
"明日香，跟我回地底都市。" 她命令道，猛地从加持手中抽出手，开始走出公寓。明日香跟在她后面，瞥了一眼真嗣和绫波。男孩站在那里，脸上带着相当呆滞的表情，而女孩则静静地继续她的餐食。

_This was not how I expected dropping off an ID card to go.  
送个 ID 卡的过程，我没想到会是这样。_

Ω

Most of the way to the Geofront, Misato broke the silence between the two women in her car.  
前往 Geofront 的大部分路程中，Misato 打破了车内两位女性间的沉默。

"You did well tonight, Asuka," she said.  
“你今晚做得很好，Asuka，”她说道。

Asuka, for her part, did not look away from lights she was watching speed by out of the passenger side window. "I couldn't let a pilot live in a place like that." _Even if I hated Ayanami enough to want her to live in squalor like that, it goes against the plan to subject her to those kind of conditions._  
至于 Asuka，她没有从乘客侧窗外飞速掠过的灯光上移开视线。“我不能让一个飞行员住在那种地方。即便我恨 Ayanami 到希望她住在那样肮脏的环境中，但那与计划相悖，不能让她遭受那种条件。”

"That's pretty much what I mean," Misato informed her. "You've taken your adopted role of pilot caretaker seriously, and you've done well at it, too. Shinji's synch rate is just part of it." She sighed and shook her head ruefully. "Pilot welfare is part of my job. You're showing me up, Asuka."  
“差不多就是这个意思，”美里告诉她，“你对待驾驶员看护者的角色非常认真，而且做得很好。真嗣的同步率只是其中一部分。”她叹了口气，无奈地摇了摇头，“照顾驾驶员的福祉也是我的职责。你让我相形见绌了，明日香。”

_It's not hard to outperform someone who demonstrated such lack of care for her pilots._ Asuka kept her silence rather than risk her bitterness shine through her voice.  
要超越一个对飞行员如此漠不关心的人并不难。明日香保持沉默，以免自己的苦涩透过声音流露出来。

"I don't want something like that to happen again," Misato continued, undeterred at the lack of response. "Not you taking care of your fellow pilots, I mean a pilot being shown such a lack of care. I can't believe I let Ayanami live like that for so long after I got here."  
"我不想再发生那样的事了，"美里继续说道，并未因缺乏回应而气馁。"我不是说你照顾其他驾驶员，我是说对驾驶员如此缺乏关怀。我不敢相信我来到这里后竟然让绫波那样生活了这么久。"

_It's all of NERV, though, not just Misato. Especially the Commander. We're tools to be used and discarded once broken. Nothing more, as far as they're concerned. Of course, they're not prepared for what I have in store for them.  
但这不仅仅是 NERV，尤其是司令。在他们看来，我们只是用过即弃的工具，一旦损坏就毫无价值。当然，他们还没准备好面对我为他们准备的一切。_

"I think I'm going to have to rely on you for more of this kind of stuff, Asuka," Misato said with a touch of regret in her voice. "There's only so much I can do as the superior officer for you guys. I mean, I can make things happen, but I can't always know everything you guys are going through. Some things comrades only share between themselves, you know?"  
“看来我得多依赖你处理这类事情了，明日香，”美里带着一丝遗憾说道，“作为你们的指挥官，我能做的有限。我是说，我可以推动事情发展，但无法完全了解你们每个人的经历。有些心事，只有战友间才会分享，你懂的吧？”

_Ha! So, you're saying Ayanami is being ordered to be my friend?_ "I suppose that's right," Asuka said without affectation.  
哈！这么说，绫波是被命令来和我做朋友的？“我想是的，”明日香不带感情地说道。

"Great! I know it's extra work for you, but with your little program going on it'll all happen naturally, I'm sure. Once you three are all best friends, I bet all your performances will be through the roof!" Misato grinned at Asuka, but it broke quickly. "I do have some bad news, though," she informed her.  
太好了！我知道这对你来说是额外的工作，但有了你的小计划，我相信一切都会自然而然地发生。一旦你们三个成为最好的朋友，我敢打赌你们的表演一定会大放异彩！"美里笑着对明日香说，但笑容很快消失了。"不过，我也有一些坏消息，"她告诉她。

_Of course you do._ "What is it?"  
当然你有。“是什么？”

"You're going to help me do the paperwork tonight to request a permanent residence in the Geofront for Ayanami. I can take the dressing down for springing this on the command team first thing in the morning by myself, but, well, welcome to the bureaucracy: no good deed goes unpunished," she said with a theatrical sigh and wave of her hand.  
“今晚你得帮我一起完成申请绫波在 Geofront 永久居住的文书工作。明早我会独自承担突然向指挥团队提出此事的责难，但唉，欢迎来到官僚世界：做好事总免不了受罚。”她带着戏剧性的叹息和手势说道。

### Chapter 8

Πάθει μάθος (He learned by suffering) — Aeschylus, 5th Century BCE  
苦尽甘来 (他通过苦难学到了教训) ——埃斯库罗斯，公元前 5 世纪

The operations center door slid shut behind Asuka as she approached Doctor Akagi's workstation, a mug of coffee clenched in each hand. The pilot had gone straight from filling out paperwork all night with her superior officer to sitting at her workstation and being frustrated by Unit 00's customary glitches and eccentricities. Her morning coffee run had been a welcome reprieve from the scant hours she had spent officially on duty so far that day.  
操作中心的大门在明日香身后缓缓关闭，她手里紧握着两杯咖啡，走向赤木律子的工作站。这位驾驶员刚从与上级军官彻夜填写文件的疲惫中解脱出来，又坐在自己的工作站前，面对着零号机惯常的故障和古怪行为感到烦躁。早晨的咖啡之旅成了她当天正式执勤以来难得的片刻喘息。

"Take this," Asuka said, extending one of the mugs she was holding to Akagi. She took a sip from her own mug as she waited for her words to break through the doctor's filter; she had her eyes locked on the screen of a portable work terminal she was holding in one hand, while her other hand typed away at the station in front of her.  
“拿着这个。”明日香说着，将手中的一杯咖啡递给律子。她自己啜了一口咖啡，等待着话语穿透博士的专注；律子的目光紧锁在手持工作终端的屏幕上，另一只手则在面前的站台上快速敲击。

_No doubt Magi related. I can't make out most of what she's got on screen. She only ever lets her little assistant work on that system with her._ Asuka deliberately did not smirk, instead clearing her throat forcefully and gently waving the coffee mug closer to Akagi's face. "Fresh coffee, Doctor," she said, louder than she had been before.  
毫无疑问是与 MAGI 系统相关的内容。我看不懂她屏幕上的大部分内容。她只允许她的小助手与她一起处理那个系统。明日香故意没有露出得意的笑容，而是用力清了清嗓子，轻轻地将咖啡杯朝律子的脸前晃了晃。“新鲜咖啡，博士。”她比之前更大声地说道。

"Hm?" The doctor in question intoned, looking up at the mug a few centimeters from her face. "Ah, thanks, Asuka," she said. She stopped typing and used her now-free hand to grab the mug, taking a sip from it before using it to push a mug of cold coffee away from its prime spot next to her keyboard and placing the fresh mug in its stead. Her hand, now unfettered, reached into a pocket of her lab coat, and withdrew a package of cigarettes. As she worked her prey free of the pack one handed, she glanced at Asuka who was standing next to her, taking solace in her own drink.  
"嗯？" 那位医生应声道，目光从离她脸几厘米的杯子抬起。"啊，谢谢，明日香。" 她说着，停下了打字，用空出来的手拿起杯子，喝了一口，然后用手中的杯子将旁边键盘旁的一杯冷咖啡推开，把新杯子放到了那个位置。她那只手现在空了出来，伸进白大褂的口袋，掏出一包香烟。她单手从烟盒里抽出一支烟，同时瞥了一眼站在旁边的明日香，后者正享受着自己的饮料。

"Long night?" Akagi asked as she lit her cigarette, still with one hand preoccupied holding her portable system.  
"熬了一整夜？" 赤城问道，一边用单手点燃香烟，另一只手还拿着便携式游戏机。

"Mm." Asuka replied, rolling out her neck and rotating one shoulder. "And now the prototype is being difficult. Like it knows we're doing an activation today."  
"嗯。" 明日香回答，扭动着脖子，转动了一下肩膀。"现在原型机又出问题了。好像它知道我们今天要启动似的。"

"Hmph," the older woman almost laughed. "Well, everything's normal, then. No leads on the feedback error we were getting, I take it?"  
"哼," 那位年长的女士几乎笑出声来。"那么，一切正常了。看来我们还没找到反馈错误的线索，对吧？"

"No," she replied with a sigh and cast her gaze back to her own workstation. It was still displaying the results of the program she had finished running before she decided to acquire some caffeine. "I've run every diagnostic program that's relevant, and several that weren't, but they all show that there's no issue on our end." _I'm beginning to suspect that whoever NERV stuffed inside the prototype is at fault for the problems we have with it. If my experience with Unit 01 is anything to go by, the personality plays a far bigger role in performance than anything else. Still, it would be stupid to not to at least_ try _as much conventional troubleshooting as we can._ "I wanted to go down to the cages next and do some poking around for myself. I'll commandeer a maintenance crew and see if we can get to the bottom of things."  
"没有," 她叹了口气，目光重新投向自己的工作站。屏幕上依然显示着她决定去获取咖啡前完成的程序运行结果。"我已经运行了所有相关的诊断程序，甚至包括一些不相关的，但它们都显示我们这边没有问题。"我开始怀疑，NERV 塞进原型机里的那个人可能是导致我们遇到问题的罪魁祸首。如果根据我对 01 号机的经验来看，人格在性能中扮演的角色远比其他任何因素都重要。不过，至少尝试尽可能多的常规故障排除还是明智的。"我想下到笼子里亲自去探查一番。我会征用一支维修队，看看能否查个水落石出。"

"Well," Akagi said, trailing off as she furrowed her brow in thought. Asuka unsurreptitiously took a long sip from her coffee mug, meeting the woman's gaze and raising an eyebrow. The doctor rolled her eyes and returned her attention to her work, quickly puffing away at her cigarette. "Fine, knock yourself out. Just don't get too eager—the activation is happening today barring any catastrophic problems, so nothing that can't be undone quickly. "  
"好吧，" 赤木律子说着，眉头紧锁陷入沉思。惣流不露声色地从咖啡杯中深深啜了一口，迎上对方的目光，挑了挑眉。医生翻了个白眼，转回工作，迅速抽了一口烟。"行吧，尽管放手去做。只是别太急切——除非出现灾难性问题，否则今天就会启动，所以别做那些难以快速挽回的事。"

"That poking around is gonna have to wait," announced the tired voice of Misato, accompanied by her hand landing on Asuka's shoulder. The girl jolted slightly and shot the woman a dark look, revealing an operations director still wearing the yellow t-shirt and high-waisted denim shorts she had been sporting when Asuka had left her to shower and change before making her own way to the operations center. She had just thrown on her customary red jacket, evidently not having enough time for anything else. She was also carrying a manila folder stuffed with papers, which she was holding out to Asuka.  
"那番探索得先搁置了，" 美里疲惫的声音响起，她的手搭在了惣流的肩上。女孩微微一惊，向她投去阴沉的目光，显露出这位作战部长依然穿着惣流离开时那件黄色 T 恤和高腰牛仔短裤的样子。她刚刚披上了惯常的红色夹克，显然没时间换别的衣服。她手里还拿着一个塞满文件的牛皮纸文件夹，正递给惣流。

"After a meeting I'd rather not recount, I got the Commander to agree to rehousing the First Child." Asuka eyed the folder but made no move to grab it, preferring to take another sip of her coffee. _She makes it sound like that's a bad thing. We spent hours working to make this happen, she should be pleased._ "He refused to move her into the Geofront; I'll not bore you with the argument we had. Suffice it to say that he believes 'her development' would be 'impeded' if she didn't live as close to a 'normal life' as possible, so he wants her to live in the city." She was now aggressively thrusting the paperwork toward Asuka's free hand.  
"在一次我宁愿不细说的会议后，我说服了指挥官同意重新安置第一适格者。" 明日香瞥了一眼文件夹，但没有伸手去拿，而是选择再啜一口咖啡。她听起来像是在抱怨。我们花了好几个小时努力促成这件事，她应该感到高兴。"他拒绝把她搬到地下来；我不想细说我们之间的争论。简而言之，他认为如果她不尽可能过'正常生活'，她的'成长'会'受阻'，所以他希望她住在城市里。" 她现在正用力地将文件推向明日香空着的那只手。

Asuka took one more wistful look at her coffee mug before snatching the folder from Misato and handing her the mug in return. Misato grinned and raised the mug to her lips, greedily sucking down its contents despite the heat while Asuka opened the folder and processed its contents.  
明日香又恋恋不舍地看了一眼她的咖啡杯，然后从美里手中夺过文件夹，同时将杯子递给她。美里咧嘴一笑，举起杯子送到唇边，尽管热气腾腾，她还是贪婪地吸吮着里面的内容，而明日香则打开文件夹，处理其中的内容。

_No one associated with NERV has a_ normal _life. Especially not the pilots. What's the Commander's point? Is this more twisted favoritism? If that's the case, he's got a shit way of playing favorites. This place is just as far away from everything as her last apartment was!_  
与 NERV 有关的人没有一个拥有正常生活。尤其是驾驶员们。指挥官到底想说什么？这是否又是某种扭曲的偏爱？如果是这样，他表达偏爱的方式真是糟糕透顶。这个地方离一切的距离和她之前的公寓一样远！

"Misato, look at this," she said, shrugging off the woman's hand from her shoulder and pointing at the address at the top of the first page that indicated the planned home for the First Child. "This building is in the middle of nowhere. Just like her last apartment." They were both ignoring the head of Project E, who was once again engrossed in her work and returning the favor.  
"美里，你看这个，" 她甩开女人搭在她肩上的手，指着第一页顶部的地址，那里标示着第一适格者的计划住所。"这栋楼在荒郊野外。就像她之前的公寓一样。" 她们俩都无视了 E 计划负责人，她再次埋头工作，也算是回敬了她们。

"I know, Asuka," Misato griped into her coffee mug.  
"我知道，明日香，" 美里抱怨着，对着她的咖啡杯说道。

"The whole point of moving the First into the Geofront was to make sure she wasn't rotting away in some shithole!"  
"把第一适格者搬到地下来住，本意就是要确保她不再烂在某个破地方！"

"I _know_, Asuka," reverberated from within the ceramic as Misato angled her mug down to meet Asuka's eyes.  
"我知道，明日香，" 从陶瓷杯中传出的声音回荡着，美里将她的杯子倾斜，与明日香的目光相遇。

"If NERV just stuffs her in some closet in the middle of nowhere, _again_, it'll be a pain in the ass to keep tabs on her!" Asuka snapped the folder closed as harshly as the flimsy paper holder would allow and fiercely returned the older woman's stare. _Come on, Misato, did you even try on this one? Or do you just not care about any pilots besides your precious Shin-chan?_ "How long do you think it'll take before she's living the same way she did in her old place? And that's assuming this one isn't already as bad! There'd have to be constant trips out to the edge of the city to check on her, instead of just being able to walk down a corridor and knock on her door!" _Who the hell has time for that?! This is stupid. Am I the only one who thinks of these things?_  
"如果 NERV 再次把她塞到某个偏僻角落的柜子里，那可真是麻烦透顶！" 明日香猛地合上文件夹，纸质夹子几乎承受不住这股力道，她狠狠地回瞪着年长的女性。拜托，美里，这次你真的尽力了吗？还是说除了你宝贝的真嗣之外，其他驾驶员你都不在乎？ "你觉得她要多久才能像以前那样生活？而且这还是假设新地方不比旧地方差的情况下！我们得频繁出城去检查她，而不是简单地走几步走廊敲敲她的门！" 谁有那么多时间做这些？！这太荒谬了。难道只有我一个人会考虑这些事情吗？

"That's enough, Pilot Soryu," Captain Katsuragi ordered as she placed her empty mug next to Ritsuko's growing collection. Asuka bit back a retort and narrowed her eyes. "There's a reason I gave you that paperwork, and it wasn't for you to get snippy with me.  
"够了，惣流·明日香·兰格雷，" 葛城美里队长命令道，她将自己的空杯子放在了律子不断增多的杯子旁边。明日香咬紧牙关，忍住反驳的冲动，眯起了眼睛。 "我给你那份文件是有原因的，不是让你对我发脾气。

"You'll be doing an inspection of the proposed quarters with Ayanami. If she doesn't like them ("As if she'd say even if she didn't," Asuka muttered) _or_ you find a fault with them, then I can present the Commander with our proposed alternatives. But I can't reject his plan without making at least a token effort at seeing it through." Misato softened her gaze and leaned against her friend's workstation by her hip. "Like I said last night, Asuka: these things take time. Time and paperwork." She gestured at the folder Asuka was still angrily clutching.  
"你将与绫波一起去检查提议的住所。如果她不喜欢（“就算她不喜欢，她也不会说出来。”明日香嘀咕道）或者你发现有什么问题，那么我就可以向司令提出我们的替代方案。但我不能在没有做出至少一次象征性尝试的情况下就否决他的计划。" 美里缓和了目光，靠在朋友的工作台上，侧身倚着。"就像我昨晚说的，明日香：这些事情需要时间。时间和文书工作。" 她指着明日香仍在愤怒地抓着的文件夹。

_Fine. That's better than nothing, I guess. But if this falls through and the First isn't up to standard by the time I need her to be, I swear I_ will _crush your car with my Unit 02._  
好吧。这总比什么都没有强，我想。但如果这事泡汤了，第一适格者在我需要她的时候还没达到标准，我发誓我会用我的二号机把你的车碾碎。

Asuka sighed and shook her head. "And when I come back here after rejecting this place? Where will the First stay until we find her somewhere suitable?"  
明日香叹了口气，摇了摇头。"当我回来拒绝这个地方后，第一适格者会住在哪里，直到我们找到合适的地方？"

"She'll continue staying at my apartment on a preliminary basis," Misato assured her. "I'm sure Shinji won't mind the company for a few extra days or so," she continued with a grin. "Pen Pen's great, don't get me wrong, but he's not the best for conversation."  
"她会暂时继续住在我公寓里，"美里向她保证道。"我相信真嗣不会介意多几天的陪伴，"她继续笑着说。"别误会，Pen Pen 很棒，但他不是最好的聊天对象。"

"As if Ayanami is any better," Asuka _hmph_ed.  
"仿佛绫波会好到哪儿去似的，"明日香哼了一声。

"I really never should have gotten all those magazine and newspaper subscriptions for him," Misato carried on, tapping her chin in thought. "All he cares about are stock prices and venture opportunities. He doesn't even have a bank account! At lease I don't think he does," she broke off with a furrowed brow.  
"我真的不该给他订那么多杂志和报纸，"美里继续说，用手指敲着下巴思考。"他只关心股票价格和创业机会。他甚至没有银行账户！至少我认为他没有，"她皱着眉头停了下来。

_Ok. Not touching that one_, Asuka thought, filing the information away to never be examined.  
好吧，这个我不碰。明日香心想，将这条信息归档，永远不去细究。

"Well, anyway," Misato recovered, "Ayanami is on her way to that address now. You've got a ride waiting for you on the surface. Both of you be back in time for the activation this afternoon, ok?"  
“好吧，不管怎样，”美里恢复了常态，“绫波已经前往那个地址了。地面上有车在等你。你们俩下午激活前要回来，好吗？”

"Right," Asuka resigned. _Not like I was going to find anything picking away at Unit 00 anyway. Might as well go hang out with its pilot._ She made her way out of the operations center, giving Misato one last barely concealed contemptuous glance while the woman helped herself to Akagi's unattended coffee.  
“明白，”明日香无奈地答应。反正我也不可能在零号机上找到什么线索。不如去和它的驾驶员聊聊。她走出作战中心，临走前还给了美里一个几乎掩饰不住的轻蔑眼神，而美里则毫不客气地喝起了律子没喝完的咖啡。

Ω

Asuka stepped out of the Section Two vehicle that had delivered her to the building the First Child was meant to be living in. She did not bother closing the door behind her, instead walking up to the blue-haired girl wearing a school uniform and carrying a school bag who was standing in front of the entrance. Asuka had spotted her from a few blocks away as the security forces drove up to the small parking lot (empty, like most of the buildings they had passed on their way), and the First Child had stared down the car until the pilot had exited it. The stare shifted to follow Asuka as she approached.  
明日香从二课的车辆中走出，这辆车将她送到了第一适格者本应居住的大楼前。她没有费心去关上车门，而是径直走向站在入口处、一头蓝发、身穿校服并背着书包的女孩。明日香在几条街外就注意到了她，当时安全部队正驶向这个小停车场（空荡荡的，就像他们沿途经过的大多数建筑一样），而第一适格者一直盯着那辆车，直到驾驶员下车。当明日香走近时，她的目光也随之移动。

_Creepy as always, First. All right, Asuka. Let's be civil—the Idiot can manage to ignore her attitude, so I can too._ "Ayanami," she said by way of greeting when she was standing a few meters in front of her.  
一如既往地令人毛骨悚然，第一适格者。好吧，明日香，让我们保持礼貌——那个白痴能忍受她的态度，我也能。"绫波，"她站在几米外打招呼道。

"Soryu," the girl replied, offering nothing else and preserving her stare.  
「惣流，」女孩回答，没有再多说什么，依旧保持着凝视。

Asuka repressed a sigh and held up the folder she was carrying, pulling out one of the sheets of paper and glancing at the information on it. "Apartment 903. You ready to check it out?" She gestured to the building behind her fellow pilot with a nod of her head, taking a closer look at it for herself as she did so. _Well, the building doesn't look like it requires a round of vaccines before entry. That's a start._  
"明日香压抑住叹息，举起手中的文件夹，抽出一张纸瞥了一眼上面的信息。“903 号公寓。准备好去看看了吗？”她向身旁的驾驶员点头示意，同时自己也仔细打量起那栋建筑。嗯，这楼看起来不需要进门先打一针疫苗。算是个不错的开始。”

The building in question was nondescript, like its neighbors: a depressing construction of concrete ten levels high, with open-air walkways on each level studded with doorways into individual residences. There were no signs of habitation apart from some lights that Asuka could see shining from inside the entry on the bottom floor.  
那栋建筑毫不起眼，与其周围的楼宇无异：一栋十层高的混凝土建筑，每层都有露天的走道，两旁排列着通往各个住宅的门。除了底层入口内透出的一些灯光外，看不出任何有人居住的迹象。

"Yes." Rei abruptly turned and opened the door to the building. Asuka followed her as she stepped inside. _Slow down, First, I can barely get a word in,_ she snarked to herself as they entered the lobby and made their way to a row of elevators. The large, open room contained a front desk, a wall of mailboxes, and an assortment of benches and chairs along the walls; it was devoid of people besides the pilots themselves and a solitary Section Two man standing near the entrance who ignored them as they passed by.  
“是的。” 丽突然转身，打开了建筑物的大门。明日香跟着她走了进去。慢点，第一，我几乎插不上话，她自嘲地想，当她们进入大厅并走向一排电梯时。这个宽敞的开放空间包含一个前台、一排邮箱墙，以及沿着墙壁摆放的各种长椅和椅子；除了她们两位驾驶员和一个站在入口附近的第二部门人员外，这里空无一人，那人无视她们从旁边经过。

An elevator opened in response to Rei's call and the pair stepped into it. Asuka leaned against a back corner while her compatriot settled directly in front of the elevator doors as they closed mere centimeters from her face.  
电梯在丽的召唤下打开，两人走了进去。明日香靠在一个角落里，而她的同伴则直接坐在电梯门前的位置，门在她面前仅几厘米处关闭。

_Here we go. Just what we both needed. Let's not have a repeat of last time, Asuka._ She mentally braced herself, then fired her opening salvo. "Did you have any issues settling into Misato's apartment?"  
开始了。正是我们俩都需要的。别再重蹈覆辙了，明日香。她在心里做好了准备，然后发起了开场白。“你搬进美里公寓时有什么问题吗？”

"No." The First Child did not turn to face her conversation partner.  
"不。" 初号机驾驶员并未转身面对她的对话对象。

Asuka let the reply stand between them for a few moments—not expecting, nor receiving, anything further from Rei, but taking the brief moment to suppress the urge to scream at her. _You've got to make this work, Asuka. Effective teamwork is vital to the plan. Strangling the First Child is not conducive to effective teamwork._ "The spare room was fine?"  
明日香让这句回答在他们之间停留了几秒钟——既不期待，也没有从绫波那里得到更多回应，只是利用这短暂的片刻压抑住朝她尖叫的冲动。你必须让这一切顺利进行，明日香。有效的团队合作对计划至关重要。掐死初号机驾驶员不利于团队合作。"备用房间还可以吗？"

"Yes," Rei informed the doors in front of her.  
"是的，" 绫波对着面前的门说道。

Asuka glared at the floor indicator as it slowly ticked over levels between the ground and their destination. _Doesn't this thing go any faster? Argh! I should have taken the stairs. No, focus. I can get a whole school groveling at my feet with my social skills par excellence—I can get the First to stop being so obstinate. Let's try humor or something._ "Did you catch the Third trying to sneak a peek at you last night?"  
明日香瞪着楼层指示灯，看着它缓慢地在地面与目的地之间跳动。这玩意就不能快点吗？啊！我应该走楼梯的。不，集中精神。我可以用我卓越的社交技巧让整个学校的人都拜倒在我的脚下——我可以让一队人不再那么固执。试试幽默什么的。“你昨晚有没有发现三号偷偷看你？”

"No."

"So, you didn't catch him then? That's a shame. You should be more careful," she said, a sage imparting wisdom to the unenlightened. _Not that he would have the guts to do something like that anyway. He probably just hid in his room and jerked off to some fantasy._  
“这么说，你没发现他？真可惜。你应该更小心点，”她像一位智者向未开化的人传授智慧一样说道。他反正也没胆子做那种事。他大概只是躲在房间里对着幻想自慰罢了。

"I don't understand," she answered as the doors opened and she stepped out. Asuka pushed past her to lead the way. "Why would Ikari-kun wish to see me without my knowledge? And why should I be on guard against such action?"  
“我不明白，”她回答着，电梯门打开，她走了出去。明日香推开她，走在前面。“为什么碇君会想在我不知情的情况下见我？我又为什么要提防这种行为？”

Asuka's stride faltered. _You_ cannot _expect me to believe that you're_ that _oblivious, First. Come on!_ "Seriously?! What are you, stu—it was a joke, Ayanami. If you really don't get it, I can explain later. Let's focus on checking this apartment out right now." _You're not making me give you the sex talk!_  
明日香的步伐一滞。你不能指望我相信你那么迟钝，第一。拜托！“真的吗？！你是傻——那是个玩笑，绫波。如果你真的不懂，我稍后可以解释。现在让我们集中精力检查这个公寓。”你可别让我给你上性教育课！

The pilots stopped in front of a door marked 903. Asuka fished inside the folder she was carrying for the card key paperclipped to one of the leaves of paper within and swiped it through the reader next to the door. It _whoosh_ed open in response, revealing a studio apartment that was just as dismal looking as the rest of the building.  
驾驶员们停在标有 903 的门前。明日香从她携带的文件夹中翻找，找到夹在一张纸上的门卡，将其刷过门旁的读卡器。门应声而开，露出一间与大楼其他部分同样阴沉的工作室公寓。

"Well, this is it," Asuka muttered as she stepped in, Rei following immediately behind her. She cast her skeptical gaze around the cramped quarters, taking in the impressively miserable appearance: unfurnished, with bare cinderblock walls, a door leading to a tiny bathroom, and a kitchenette whose only improvement over Ayanami's previous cooking space was the lack of mold and discarded remains of convenience store meals.  
“好吧，就是这里，”明日香一边说着一边踏入，绫波紧随其后。她用怀疑的目光环顾这狭小的空间，注意到其令人印象深刻的凄凉外观：未装修，裸露的煤渣砖墙，通向一个小浴室的门，以及一个厨房，唯一的改进是比绫波之前的烹饪空间少了霉菌和便利店餐食的废弃物。

Asuka tossed the folder onto the countertop in the kitchenette. "Thoughts?" She prompted to the girl who had stopped next to her without so much as a glance at anything besides the far wall.  
明日香将文件夹扔到小厨房的台面上。“有什么想法吗？”她向那位停在她身边、除了远处的墙壁外几乎没看任何东西的女孩问道。

"These quarters are sufficient for my needs," Rei answered her.  
“这些房间足够满足我的需求，”绫波回答她。

Asuka did not wrap her hands around the girl's neck and shake her—rather, she grabbed her shoulders and shook her. "_Sufficient for your needs_?!" She yelled. "Ayanami, there's not even a bed!"  
明日香没有用手掐住女孩的脖子摇晃她——而是抓住她的肩膀摇晃。“满足你的需求？！”她大喊道，“绫波，这里连张床都没有！”

"A sleeping configuration that is satisfactory to you can be easily arranged. In the meantime, this space is adequate." She had narrowed her eyes slightly at the other girl's violent outburst and assault on her person but made no move to free herself.  
"一个让你满意的睡眠安排可以轻松布置。与此同时，这个空间足够了。" 她对另一个女孩的激烈爆发和人身攻击微微眯起了眼睛，但没有采取行动挣脱。

"Satis—that's not the point, First!" Asuka let go of Rei and shifted her target to the nearby counter. She stomped towards it and pounded on it with one hand and angrily threw her other arm out in a short gesture to sweep across the entire apartment. "Look at this place and _honestly_ tell me that you want to live here!"  
"满——足——这不是重点，第一！" 明日香松开了绫波，转向附近的柜台。她大步走向它，用一只手猛击柜台，另一只手愤怒地挥动，扫过整个公寓。"看看这个地方，诚实地告诉我，你想住在这里吗！"

Rei looked at the place. "It is sufficient for my needs," she honestly told her. She returned her gaze to the fuming redhead.  
绫波环视了一下这个地方。"它满足我的需求，"她诚实地告诉她。她将目光转回气愤的红发女孩。

_How quickly can the Marduk Institute locate another pilot candidate? I'm going to kill this one myself._ Asuka closed her eyes and took a deep breath, releasing it slowly after holding it for a few seconds. _Not yet, Asuka. Don't let her mind games get to you._  
马杜克研究所能多快找到另一个驾驶员候选人？我要亲手解决这个。明日香闭上眼睛，深吸一口气，几秒钟后缓缓呼出。还不到时候，明日香。别让她的心理战术影响到你。

"I didn't ask if you thought it was sufficient. I asked if you _want to live here_."  
“我没问你觉得够不够。我问的是你想不想住在这里。”

Ayanami raised an eyebrow the slightest bit and turned her lips down in a tiny frown. "My wants are irrelevant. The Commander has ordered me to live here."  
绫波微微挑了挑眉，嘴角略微下垂，露出一丝微小的皱眉。“我的愿望无关紧要。指挥官命令我住在这里。”

Asuka's eyes opened and she shot Rei a glare that would have stopped the Third Child's heart on the spot. "And you just do exactly what the Commander tells you to, all the time? Even if it's stupid?"  
明日香睁开眼睛，向绫波投去一个足以让第三适格者当场心碎的锐利目光。“你就总是完全按照司令的吩咐去做，不管多蠢的事？”

"I follow the Commander's orders. He is not required to justify them to me." Rei easily met the other pilot's lethal stare.  
“我服从司令的命令。他无需向我解释其合理性。”绫波轻松地迎上了另一位驾驶员的致命凝视。

"So, you're his doll, doing whatever shitty thing he says, living in whatever shitty dollhouse he assigns you in whatever shitty neighborhood in whatever shitty middle of nowhere?" Asuka pushed away from the counter and closed in on Rei, placing her hands on her hips and glaring down at her from her minute height advantage.  
“所以，你就是他的傀儡，任由他摆布，住在任何他指定的破烂玩偶屋里，无论是在哪个偏僻角落的哪个破败街区？”明日香从柜台旁推开，逼近绫波，双手叉腰，从微小的身高优势上俯视着她。

Rei's frown deepened into her version of a full-blown scowl. "I am not a doll."  
丽皱眉加深，变成了她特有的那种全然不悦的表情。“我不是玩偶。”

"Then _prove it_!" Asuka roared into her face. "I want to hear _your_ opinion about living here! Not the Commander's!" _You can't play the good little girl Commander's Pet your whole life, First, come down and slum it with the rest of us mortals you can't bring yourself to interact with!_  
“那就证明给我看！”明日香对着她的脸吼道，“我想听听你对住在这里的看法！不是司令的！你不能一辈子都扮演那个乖巧的小女孩，司令的宠儿，首先，下来和我们这些凡人打成一片吧，你不是一直没法和我们交流吗！”

Her scowl smoothed out into her normal neutral expression, though her brows remained drawn. "I—I am unsure."  
她的怒容平复成平常的中性表情，尽管眉头依旧紧锁。“我——我不确定。”

_Finally! It's a start._ Asuka nodded and backed up slightly from the other girl while crossing her arms. "Tell me what you're unsure of."  
终于！这是个开始。明日香点头，稍稍后退，同时交叉双臂。“告诉我你在犹豫什么。”

The pair stood in silence for a moment, maintaining eye contact with each other while Rei seemingly pondered the question.  
两人沉默地对峙片刻，目光交织，丽似乎在深思这个问题。

"I do not know if the isolation that living here would enforce would be beneficial," she finally answered. The faintest trace of doubt marred her face.  
“我不确定住在这里的隔离生活是否真的有益，”她终于回答道，脸上掠过一丝几乎察觉不到的疑虑。

_I've made a breach! Time to press the advantage._ "So, you _don't_ want to live in the middle of nowhere all alone?"  
我已打开缺口！是时候乘胜追击了。“所以，你不想独自住在荒郊野外？”

"I am capable of living independently," Rei told Asuka flatly, "but—"  
“我有能力独立生活，”丽平静地告诉明日香，“但是——”

"But your nearest neighbor being twenty minutes away by car fucking sucks? Not to mention the lack of shops around here." Asuka shook her head. "You'd need to transfer trains at least four times to get to your school, and the Geofront is even further away. That's not even taking into consideration the distance to the closest train station."  
“但是最近的邻居开车也要二十分钟，这他妈的太糟糕了？更别提这附近连商店都没有。”明日香摇了摇头。“你要去学校至少得换乘四次火车，而且地底都市更远。这还没考虑到最近的火车站有多远。”

"Yes," Rei agreed. "In the event of an emergency, it would take a considerable amount of time to arrive at the Geofront. The last sortie against an Angel was completed in less time."  
“是的，”丽同意道，“在紧急情况下，到达地底都市需要相当长的时间。上次对抗使徒的出击完成得更快。”

_That's at least a good official reason to not want to live here, but you're missing the point, First._ "I think you mean to say that _my victory was swift and decisive_." _If Unit 01 wants to share the credit, it can damn well come out here and say so itself._ "Anyway. How was it staying at Misato's last night?"  
这至少是个不想住在这里的官方好理由，但你没抓住重点，第一。“我想你是想说我的胜利迅速而果断。”如果初号机想分享功劳，它最好亲自出来这么说。“总之，昨晚在美里小姐家过得怎么样？”

Rei looked at her with what would have been, on anyone else, a blank expression, but Asuka was now barely able to identify as a questioning face. "I already informed you that I encountered no issues in Captain Katsuragi's apartment."  
丽看着她，换作别人脸上会是空白表情，但明日香现在勉强能辨认出那是一张询问的脸。“我已经告诉过你，我在葛城 captain 的公寓里没有遇到任何问题。”

"Once again, First, that wasn't what I asked," Asuka growled. "Did you like it? Was it _beneficial_? And not to NERV, I mean to you."  
"又一次，初号机，那不是我问的，" 明日香咆哮道。"你喜欢吗？它有益吗？不是对 NERV，我是说对你自己。"

Rei once more took a moment to ponder the question, leaving Asuka to radiate tension into the cramped, gloomy space. "I found it to be a pleasant experience," she confirmed.  
绫波再次花了一会儿时间思考这个问题，让明日香在狭小阴暗的空间里散发出紧张的气氛。"我觉得那是一次愉快的经历，"她确认道。

"Do go on, First," Asuka said dryly. When she again received a questioning look, her eyes hardened in exasperation. "Agh! Give me _details_, Ayanami! Tell me what you did, what happened, what you liked. That kind of stuff." _I can logic her into convincing herself that she wants to live nearby people she's familiar with. Combine that with her concerns about an emergency, and she'll tell the Commander for herself that she wants an apartment in the Geofront._  
"继续说，初号机，" 明日香干巴巴地说。当她再次收到一个疑问的眼神时，她的眼神因恼怒而变得坚硬。"啊！给我细节，绫波！告诉我你做了什么，发生了什么，你喜欢什么。那种东西。" 我可以逻辑上说服她，让她相信她想住在熟悉的人附近。结合她对紧急情况的担忧，她会自己告诉指挥官她想要在 Geofront 的公寓。

"Ikari-kun helped me to arrange my personal effects while Inspector Kaji cleared the waste from Captain Katsuragi's spare room. Ikari-kun and I conversed."  
"碇君帮我整理了个人物品，而加持警官则清理了葛城美里队长备用房间的垃圾。碇君和我聊了会儿天。"

"I'll bet you did," Asuka muttered. _More like Shinji stammered a few half-formed sentences while tripping over himself trying to dote on you and you offered one-word responses. Talking with either of you is like pulling teeth! I swear, you two could be siblings._ "Anything else?"  
"我敢打赌，"明日香嘀咕道。"更像是真嗣结结巴巴地说了几句半成品的话，同时笨手笨脚地想讨好你，而你只用单字回应。跟你们俩说话简直像拔牙一样！我发誓，你们俩简直像亲兄妹。"还有别的吗？"

"Ikari-kun gave me blankets and pillows for the night, then we retired to bed while Inspector Kaji spent the remainder of the evening with Captain Katsuragi's other roommate. He left early in the morning while Ikari-kun served breakfast before packing lunches for us."  
"碇君给了我毯子和枕头过夜，然后我们就去睡觉了，而加持警官则和葛城美里队长的另一位室友度过了余下的夜晚。他一大早就离开了，而碇君则在为我们准备早餐和打包午餐之前先做了早饭。"

"Sounds like a blast. You had fun, then?" Asuka asked her, certainly not imagining a conversation between Pen Pen and Kaji the previous evening. _He can't talk. He's a bird. Maybe,_ maybe_, he can read, but he can't talk!_  
"听起来挺热闹的。你玩得开心吗？" 明日香问她，当然没有想象前一晚企鹅 Pen Pen 和加持先生之间的对话。他又不会说话。他只是一只鸟。也许，也许他能读懂，但他不会说话！

"Yes," Rei answered after taking some time to consider the issue. "While I do not trust Inspector Kaji, his presence did not detract from the experience."  
"是的，" 绫波回答，经过一段时间的思考后。"虽然我不信任加持警官，但他的存在并没有影响这次体验。"

_Ok, First, we'll get into why you don't like Kaji some other time._ "So, between spending the night at your old place, just you, the mold spores, and the garbage, and spending the night at Misato's, where you got a _conversation with Ikari-kun_ and a homemade breakfast with bonus packed lunch, which would you rather do again?"  
好吧，首先，我们改天再谈你为什么不喜欢加持。那么，你是宁愿在你旧住处过夜，只有你、霉菌孢子和垃圾，还是宁愿在美里那里过夜，和碇君聊聊天，还有自制早餐加打包午餐，你更愿意再体验哪个？

Rei did what was unthinkable to Asuka: she offered the tiniest smile the angry pilot had ever seen. "I would prefer to stay in Captain Katsuragi's residence again. Ikari-kun's company is more gratifying than seclusion."  
丽做了对明日香来说难以想象的事：她向这位愤怒的驾驶员展露了有史以来最微小的笑容。“我更愿意再次住在葛城上尉的住所。比起独处，碇君的陪伴更令人满意。”

Asuka stomped on the anger she felt rising in her and swallowed down the vitriol that she instinctually wanted to throw at Rei. _Get ahold of yourself, Asuka! It doesn't matter what she and the Idiot do together, as long as it doesn't mess with the plan. In fact, right now, this is only helping the plan. This is what you want to happen._  
明日香强压下心中升起的怒火，咽下了本能想要向丽喷涌而出的刻薄话。控制住自己，明日香！只要不影响计划，她和那个白痴做什么都无关紧要。事实上，现在这只是在帮助计划。这正是你希望发生的事情。

"Then there's your answer," she snapped, turning around quickly and grabbing the folder she had left on the counter. "You're not moving here. We'll find you someplace closer to the Geofront—a place that doesn't look like a prison cell." She began to head for the door. "Just for the record," she added, as she exited, "I was the approving authority on the move, and I rejected this place before I even got here."  
“那么答案已经有了，”她厉声说道，迅速转身拿起放在柜台上的文件夹。“你不会搬到这里。我们会为你找个离地表更近的地方——一个看起来不像监狱牢房的地方。”她开始向门口走去。“只是为了记录，”她出门时补充道，“搬迁的批准权在我，我甚至在来这里之前就否决了这个地方。”

Rei did not offer her thoughts on the matter as they made their way down the hall.  
丽并没有对此事发表意见，他们一起沿着走廊走下去。

"Let's get back to the Geofront," Asuka muttered, heading for the stairs.  
“我们回地底都市吧，”明日香嘟囔着，朝楼梯走去。

Ω

Asuka once again found herself entering the operations center with a mug of coffee, this time with the First Child in tow. Rei was holding another mug of coffee with her free hand not occupied with her school bag. The Second Child scanned the room for her target, her gaze sliding over Doctor Akagi, huddled over a workstation with her assistant hanging on her every word and gesture, homing in on the operations director seated at a powered down terminal and resting her chin in her hand.  
明日香再次带着一杯咖啡走进作战中心，这次还带着第一适格者。绫波用空着的那只手拿着另一杯咖啡，另一只手则提着书包。第二适格者扫视着房间寻找目标，目光掠过正与助手聚精会神讨论的赤木博士，最终锁定在操作主任身上，她坐在一台已关闭的终端前，手托着下巴休息。

She proceeded to her target, wordlessly trusting Ayanami to continue to follow her as she had since leaving the rejected apartment.  
她继续向目标前进，无声地信任着绫波会像离开那间被拒绝的公寓后一样继续跟随她。

"We finished our recon, Misato," Asuka told the woman's back. Misato excitedly spun her chair around and jumped up from it, stretching her arms above her head.  
“我们已经完成了侦察，美里，”明日香对着女人的背影说道。美里兴奋地转过椅子，从上面跳了起来，伸展双臂举过头顶。

"Ah, my weary pilots return from their mission! What news from the front?" Asuka watched her eyes focus on the folder she still carried in one hand before quickly bouncing to the mug in her other one. _I've got to stop giving her material. I keep walking into her shitty attempts at levity._  
“啊，我疲惫的飞行员们从任务中归来！前线有什么消息？”明日香看着她的目光先聚焦在她仍拿着的文件夹上，然后迅速跳到她另一只手上的杯子。我得停止给她提供素材。我总是陷入她那糟糕的幽默尝试中。

"We brought you coffee, Ma'am." Rei surprised Asuka by stepping up next to her and extending her gift to the officer, who smiled brightly as she accepted it.  
"我们给您带了咖啡，女士。" 丽出乎意料地走到明日香旁边，将礼物递给那位官员，她笑容灿烂地接了过去。

"Secondary objective complete, then. Thanks, you two. The primary objective?" She queried, taking a conservative swallow.  
"次要任务完成了，那么。谢谢你们俩。主要任务呢？" 她询问道，小心翼翼地喝了一口。

"The First Child didn't approve the move," Asuka answered with a smirk, taking out one of the forms from her folder, careful not to spill her drink. "She noted some security concerns with being quartered so far from the Geofront—and would prefer to live in closer proximity to both her place of duty and her fellow NERV personnel. I concurred with her assessment and filled out the denial form." She held out the form for Misato to inspect.  
"第一适格者不同意这个安排，" 明日香带着一丝得意的笑容回答，从文件夹里拿出一张表格，小心不让饮料洒出来。"她指出离地表这么远的地方居住存在安全问题——而且她更愿意住在离工作地点和 NERV 同事们更近的地方。我同意她的评估，并填写了拒绝表格。" 她将表格递给美里检查。

She ignored the paper and raised an eyebrow at Rei. "Really? I'd like to hear your thoughts, Ayanami." Asuka's eyebrow twitched, but she shielded her anger at the question from view by raising her mug up to her face.  
她无视了那份文件，对丽挑了挑眉。“真的吗？我想听听你的想法，绫波。”明日香眉头一跳，但她用举起杯子遮住脸的方式掩饰了这个问题引发的怒气。

"The Second Child's account is not strictly true," Rei answered. _Bitch!_ "I expressed unease with being so far from Headquarters, which could be disastrous in the event of an Angel attack. But to be more specific, I did not say that I wish to live closer to NERV personnel. I informed her that I enjoy the company of Ikari-kun."

Misato's inquiring look began to quickly form into a mischievous leer; Asuka hurried to forestall any of her games. "_Which means_ she should be assigned to living quarters inside the Geofront, which offers closer access to the Evas and her school. _Which she attends with the Third_." Asuka glared side-eyed at the girl beside her. _If you gave her that opening on purpose, I'll make your life a living hell in Pilot Academy. Which is not what it's called!_  
"美里探究的眼神迅速转变为一种狡黠的笑意；明日香急忙阻止她任何可能的恶作剧。“这意味着她应该被分配到地下的居住区，那里更接近 EVA 和她的学校。她和第三适格者一起上学。”明日香斜眼瞪着身边的女孩。如果你是故意给出这个机会的，我会在驾驶员学院让你生不如死。那地方根本不叫这个名字！”

"I suppose we'll see what it means," Misato said, stroking her cheek with the fingers of her free hand—not even attempting to hide her smile. "All right." She placed her mug down and held out her hand for the folder. Asuka relinquished it to her.  
"我想我们会明白它的含义，"美里说道，用空着的手指轻抚脸颊——甚至不掩饰她的微笑。"好吧。"她放下杯子，伸手去拿文件夹。明日香将它递给了她。

"I'll come up with some alternatives for the Commander." Her eyes flicked to a clock on the wall. "We'll reconvene later today so you both can provide some input. Meanwhile, there's still some time before your activation test, Ayanami. You two grab some lunch. When you're finished eating, Asuka, head back up here to help oversee the test. While Ayanami's doing the activation, Shinji will be standing by in Unit 01—just in case. He should be on his way here from the school right now."  
"我会为司令准备一些备选方案。"她的目光扫向墙上的时钟。"我们今天晚些时候再集合，让你们俩提供一些意见。与此同时，绫波，你的激活测试还有一些时间。你们俩去吃个午饭。吃完饭后，明日香，回到这里来协助监督测试。绫波进行激活时，真嗣将在 01 号机待命——以防万一。他应该正从学校赶来这里。"

_Great. She'll take that as an order, and now I get to have lunch with the First. Exactly what my day needed._ "When do you want to meet to go over the paperwork? We've got—"  
太好了。她会把这个当作命令，现在我可以和初号机驾驶员一起吃午饭了。正是我今天需要的。 "你想什么时候碰头处理文件？我们有——"

Misato waved a hand in front of her face in dismissal. "It'll be before Soryu's Training Camp. Don't worry, Asuka, I have it all under control."  
美里不以为意地挥了挥手。“那是在惣流训练营之前的事。别担心，明日香，一切都在我的掌控之中。”

_That's what I'm worried about most of the time these days. And you know it isn't called Soryu's Training Camp!_ "Fine," Asuka said with exasperation. She turned to leave the operations center, Misato returning to her seat and Rei following the pilot out.  
这就是我这些天最担心的事情。而且你知道那不叫惣流训练营！“好吧，”明日香带着恼怒说道。她转身离开作战中心，美里回到座位上，丽则跟着驾驶员走了出去。

As the door closed behind them and Asuka made for the elevators, Rei defied expectations by veering off towards the break room they had just gotten coffee from. Asuka chose to not question what she saw as a blessing, but her expectations were defied once more when Rei called out to her.  
当门在他们身后关闭，明日香走向电梯时，丽出人意料地转向了他们刚刚取咖啡的休息室。明日香决定不追问，认为这是件好事，但她的预期再次被打破，因为丽叫住了她。

"Second. Where are you going?"  
"第二，你要去哪儿？"

Asuka reluctantly turned to face the other girl. "I'm going to the dining facility, First. To eat what they call food before I spend the next several hours staring at a computer screen and developing a migraine while the prototype acts up."  
明日香不情愿地转过身面对另一个女孩。“我要去食堂，第一。在盯着电脑屏幕几个小时并因原型机出问题而头疼之前，先吃点他们所谓的食物。”

"I am going to the nearby break room to eat the lunch Ikari-kun prepared," Rei informed her.  
“我要去附近的休息室吃碇君准备的午餐。”绫波告诉她。

"Great. Fantastic. Good for you." Asuka shook her head and turned back to her path.  
"太好了。棒极了。你真行。" 明日香摇了摇头，转身继续走她的路。

"Second."

"_What_?" Asuka growled, once again stopping and turning to face Rei. "Just because Misato told us to get lunch while we were standing next to each other doesn't mean we have to eat together."  
"什么？" 明日香咆哮道，再次停下脚步，转身面对绫波。"就因为美里让我们在站在一起的时候去吃午饭，并不意味着我们就得一起吃。"

"You do not understand. Ikari-kun prepared lunch."  
"你不明白。碇君准备了午餐。"

"I know, you've sai—" _Oh._ "You mean he packed lunch for both of us. Why didn't you just say _that_, First?" _Effective communication. That's going to be a long road, apparently._  
"我知道，你已经说——" 哦。"你是说他给我们俩都打包了午餐。你为什么不直接说呢，一式？" 有效沟通。看来这将是一条漫长的道路。

"I did," Rei said flatly. "I told you earlier today: 'Ikari-kun served breakfast before packing lunches for us.'"  
"我说了，" 零淡淡地回答。"我今天早些时候就告诉过你：'碇君先做了早餐，然后给我们打包了午餐。'

Asuka shot her a look and started towards the break room, brushing past Rei who fell in to follow behind her. "Do you not know what the word 'ambiguous' means, First?"  
明日香瞪了她一眼，朝休息室走去，擦身而过时零跟了上来。"你不知道'模棱两可'是什么意思吗，一式？

"I do," Rei answered without further comment.  
"我愿意，" 丽回答，没有进一步的评论。

Asuka suppressed a scream as the pilots entered the break room with its vending machines, coffee and tea stations, and small eating area. She chose the table nearest the door and dropped heavily into a seat. The long hours, coupled with her dealings with the First Child, were beginning to make themselves felt.  
当驾驶员们进入休息室，里面有自动售货机、咖啡和茶站以及一个小用餐区时，明日香强忍住尖叫。她选择了离门最近的桌子，重重地坐下。长时间的劳累，再加上与第一适格者的交涉，开始让她感到疲惫。

Asuka drank deeply from her coffee mug while Rei retrieved two bento boxes from within her bag. She placed one decorated with blue markings in front of herself and handed a red adorned one to Asuka, who accepted it with a quirked eyebrow. _Points for style, Third. You just happened to have these lying around?_  
明日香深饮一口咖啡，而丽从她的包里取出两个便当盒。她将一个带有蓝色标记的放在自己面前，并递给明日香一个红色装饰的，后者带着一丝挑眉接过。有风格，第三适格者。你正好随身带着这些？

Rei had already opened hers and begun eating mechanically while Asuka inspected the contents of her lunch. A small smile broke across her face, unnoticed. _Leftovers from the party last night. Better than the slop NERV serves, that's for sure._  
丽已经打开她的那份，机械地开始进食，而明日香则仔细检查着自己午餐的内容。一丝微笑在她脸上绽放，未被察觉。昨晚派对的剩菜。肯定比 NERV 提供的那烂糊糊好多了。

As the contented redhead started in on her own meal, the girl across from her looked up. "Second."  
当心满意足的红发少女开始享用自己的餐点时，对面女孩抬起头来。"第二。"

A bite of food suspended halfway to her lips, Asuka met Rei's stare. "What now, First?" She quickly stuffed the food into her mouth and began chewing before she was expected to answer and further delay the first enjoyable thing she'd done all day.  
食物停在半空中，明日香迎上了丽的目光。"又怎么了，第一？"她迅速将食物塞进嘴里，开始咀嚼，以免被要求回答而进一步推迟这一天中第一件让她愉快的事情。

"Ikari-kun wished me to offer you his apologies if the food was not to your liking."  
“碇君希望我代他向你道歉，如果食物不合你口味的话。”

_Great. He's apologizing by proxy, now. And I don't know what's worse: that, or the fact that an apology sounds so natural coming from her. We seriously need to do a DNA test on those two, there's no way they aren't related._ "The food is fine. No apology needed," she muttered, returning to her meal.  
太好了。他现在通过代理人来道歉了。我不知道哪个更糟糕：是这个，还是她的道歉听起来如此自然。我们真的需要给他们俩做个 DNA 测试，他们不可能不是亲戚。“食物很好，不需要道歉。”她咕哝着，继续吃她的饭。

Rei had her brows drawn together ever so slightly, eyes narrowed as she studied the other pilot's face for a few moments, watching her eat. "Second," she said again.  
绫波微微皱起眉头，眼睛眯起来，仔细观察着另一位驾驶员的脸，看着她吃饭。“二号机驾驶员。”她再次说道。

"What now, First?" Asuka huffed, not looking up from her food.  
“现在呢，第一？”明日香哼了一声，没有从她的食物上抬起头。

"Will you explain now?"  
“你现在愿意解释了吗？”

Asuka returned her confused look, though much less muted, and took a break from her meal to give her full attention to Rei. "Explain what?"  
明日香回以一个困惑的表情，尽管比之前明显得多，她暂时放下餐食，全神贯注地看向绫波。“解释什么？”

"Ikari-kun's clandestine viewing activities, and why I must take care concerning them."  
"碇君的秘密观看活动，以及我为何必须对此谨慎对待。"

Asuka spluttered and blushed, glad that she had momentarily stopped eating to address Rei's chosen topic. _No, this isn't happening. She's not tricking me into humiliating myself by explaining horny teenage boys to her._  
明日香语塞脸红，庆幸自己暂时停止进食来应对绫波选择的话题。不，这不是真的。她没有在骗我通过向她解释青春期男孩的冲动来让自己出丑。

"Don't pretend you don't get it, First," she said harshly once she had recovered. She returned to her meal, angrily stabbing at the food with the fork the Third had thoughtfully provided for her instead of chopsticks (_Not that I can't use your primitive eating utensils, Idiot_).  
"别装作你不懂，第一适格者，"她恢复镇定后严厉地说道。她继续用餐，愤怒地用第三适格者体贴地为她准备的叉子（而不是筷子）戳着食物（我可不是不会用你们原始的餐具，白痴）。

Rei took another bite of her own food, looking down at her meal thoughtfully as the two spent the next several minutes eating in silence. After taking the time to seemingly consider Asuka's remark, Rei gave her the same questioning look.  
丽又咬了一口自己的食物，低头沉思着，两人接下来的几分钟里默默地吃着饭。在似乎仔细考虑了明日香的话之后，丽给了她一个同样疑惑的眼神。

"There is no pretense. I do not understand your meaning."  
“没有掩饰。我不明白你的意思。”

"Uh," Asuka answered her, uncharacteristically at a loss. _Ok, so she doesn't get it. Still not doing this._ She scooped up the remains of her meal onto her fork and quickly shoved them into her mouth, chewing quickly while gesturing to a clock on a wall. "That'll have to wait, First, Unit 00's activation is in twenty minutes." The flustered girl packed up her bento and slid it across the table to Rei, who dutifully began packing away the remains of her own lunch. "See you later."  
“呃，”明日香回答她，出乎意料地不知所措。好吧，她没懂。但还是不做这个。她用叉子把剩下的饭菜一扫而空，迅速塞进嘴里，一边快速咀嚼一边指着墙上的钟。“这个得等等，首先，零号机的启动还有二十分钟。”慌乱的女孩收拾好自己的便当，滑到丽面前，丽则认真地开始收拾自己剩下的午餐。“再见。”

"Yes, we will see each other during the activation test," Rei offered to Asuka's retreating form, the embarrassed girl not even registering what she would normally perceive to be condescension from her fellow pilot.  
“是的，激活测试时我们会再见面的。”丽对着明日香远去的身影说道，那位尴尬的女孩甚至没有察觉到她通常会认为的来自同僚的轻蔑。

Ω

_Maybe she really is that clueless_, Asuka thought as she glanced over the screen in front of her. It mostly displayed the normal pilot and system data that she was used to but included a few anomalies whose cause had been eluding her and the technicians for several days now. Nothing that would cause NERV to delay a test, however, especially considering their history of workplace safety. _Should I reassess my approach with her?_  
也许她真的那么迟钝，明日香瞥了一眼面前的屏幕，上面主要显示着她习惯的正常飞行员和系统数据，但也包含了一些已经困扰她和技术人员数天的异常情况。不过，这些都不会导致 NERV 推迟测试，尤其是考虑到他们一贯的职场安全记录。我是否应该重新评估与她的相处方式？

She mulled over her interactions with Rei that day, which amounted to significantly more time than she had ever spent with the girl in her "previous" go around. _I'm trying not to hate her_, she reassured herself. _I don't have to like her, but the plan won't work if we can't stand each other again._  
她反复思考着那天与丽的互动，这些时间加起来比她“之前”任何一次都要多。我正努力不去恨她，她安慰自己，我不必喜欢她，但如果我们再次无法忍受对方，计划就不会成功。

The technicians and crew around the operations center began their normal chatter associated with inserting an entry plug and activating an Eva, which Asuka had long ago learned to filter for only what she needed to hear. _Could it all not just be some stupid act? After all, Shinji is pretty clueless too. Maybe I'm the only pilot who can act like a normal human being._ She recalled the times she'd been variously disappointed, aghast, pissed off, and otherwise surprised by the Third Child's actions—or lack thereof.  
操作中心的技术人员和工作人员开始进行与插入插入栓和启动 EVA 相关的常规交谈，这些声音，明日香早已学会过滤，只听取她需要的信息。这一切难道不能只是一场愚蠢的表演吗？毕竟，真嗣也相当懵懂无知。或许我是唯一能表现得像个正常人的驾驶员。她回想起自己对第三适格者行为的种种失望、震惊、愤怒以及其他意外反应的时刻——或是他的无动于衷。

A penetrable wall left unassaulted, a tease unnoticed, a compliment undone, a kiss unreturned; so many interactions with the boy she had spent so much time with had always seemed to end in confusion and grief. Her eyes flicked over to one of the large screens displaying Shinji's face from inside Unit 01's entry plug, where he exhibited nervousness and concern. _No doubt worried that his doll might get damaged. No!_ Asuka rebuked herself.  
一堵可穿透的墙未被攻击，一个未被注意的挑逗，一句未完成的赞美，一个未回应的吻；与这个她花了那么多时间相处的男孩的许多互动，似乎总是以困惑和悲伤告终。她的目光扫过其中一个显示着真嗣从 01 号机插入栓内面孔的大屏幕，他显得紧张而关切。无疑是在担心他的玩偶可能会受损。不！明日香在心中斥责自己。

_I can't think like that anymore. Whether or not it's true doesn't matter._ She angrily shifted her eyes back to her screen as someone in the background announced that the activation was successful. _I spent most of the day alone with Ayanami, and I only wanted to kill her a few times. The Idiot is improving, too, even if he still apologizes too much. If I want to make this work, I have to force myself to think differently—not just go through the motions._  
我不能再这样想了。无论真假都无关紧要。她气愤地将目光移回屏幕，背景中有人宣布激活成功。我大部分时间都和绫波单独在一起，期间只想杀了她几次。那个白痴也在进步，尽管他还是道歉太多。如果我想让这一切顺利，我必须强迫自己换一种思维方式——不仅仅是走过场。

Asuka's face scrunched up in distaste. _Which means more conversations with the Fir—with Ayanami. Conversations that occur under the assumption that she is_ not _deliberately acting like a stuck-up entitled bitch who thinks she's better than me. Even if I'm not necessarily convinced that isn't the case._ She sighed quietly to herself as Misato happily informed Rei that she needed to sit tight for a little while but otherwise they'd wrap things up in a few hours. _Who would have thought that my plan would require so much sacrifice?_  
明日香的脸皱了起来，显得很不悦。这意味着要和绫波进行更多对话。这些对话的前提是她并非故意表现得像个自命不凡的婊子，认为自己高人一等。即便我并不完全相信她不是那样的人。她轻叹一声，听到美里高兴地告诉绫波需要稍等片刻，但几小时后就能结束。谁会想到我的计划需要如此多的牺牲？

"Pattern Blue detected—it's an Angel!" Hyuga called out from his station a few seats to Asuka's left. Her eyes snapped to the tactical display as Misato called out orders behind her.  
“蓝色模式侦测到——是使徒！” 日向从明日香左边的座位上喊道。她的目光立刻转向战术显示屏，美里在她身后下达指令。

_Fuck! They're both already in their Evas, there's no chance I can get them to launch me in Unit 01._ Regardless of that, Asuka jumped from her seat and ran towards the exit, making her way to the pilot locker rooms as fast as she could while Misato continued to issue commands.  
该死！他们都已经进入 Eva 了，我没机会让 01 号机发射我了。尽管如此，明日香从座位上跳起来，朝着出口狂奔，尽可能快地赶往飞行员更衣室，而美里继续发布指令。

_Which one was this? The giant floating diamond, right?_ She skidded to a stop in front of the bank of elevators, stabbing her finger into an override button that would immediately call a car to her level. As she barged into the first elevator that opened for her and repeatedly mashed the button for the right floor, Misato's voice came over the intercom in the enclosed space.  
这是哪一个？那个巨大的漂浮钻石，对吧？她急停在电梯前，用力按下能立即呼叫电梯到她所在楼层的紧急按钮。一进到为她打开的第一部电梯，她就疯狂地按下正确楼层的按钮，这时美里的声音通过电梯内的对讲系统传来。

"Asuka, once you get changed, get back up here. Unit 01 is launching in thirty seconds, Unit 00 is disconnecting now to join him, and I want you on tactical net." Asuka felt her stomach plummet along with the elevator as it descended much more quickly than normal.  
“明日香，换好衣服后，立刻回到这里。01 号机将在三十秒后发射，00 号机现在断开连接加入他，我要你接入战术网络。”随着电梯比平时更快地下降，明日香感到自己的胃也随之沉了下去。

"Right," the pilot said, depressing the transmission button so her reply would make it to the operations center. She bit back the frustration at not being able to sortie immediately against the Angel, using the emotion to fuel her sprint to the locker rooms as the elevator doors opened.  
“好，”驾驶员按下通讯按钮，确保她的回复能传到指挥中心。她强忍着无法立即出击对抗使徒的挫败感，将这份情绪转化为冲刺到更衣室的动力，当电梯门打开时。

She burst through the doors of her destination and barely avoided colliding into her locker, the frenetic sounds of the operations center directing a battle accompanying her through an intercom. _Shinji just launched_, she confirmed from the chatter while she haphazardly tossed her clothes into her locker and pulled on her plugsuit.  
她冲进目的地的大门，险些撞上自己的储物柜，指挥中心指挥战斗的急促声音通过对讲机伴随着她。她从对话中确认，真嗣刚刚出击，而她则匆忙地将衣服扔进储物柜，迅速穿上插入栓服。

As she pressed the button on her cuff to pressurize her suit, the faint hiss of air was drowned out by the sound of a boy screaming and technicians bellowing to each other. _Shinji! What's going on?!_ Asuka heard Captain Katsuragi order the bolts on the launch platform be released, but the rest of the battle was lost to her as she raced out of the locker room; she nearly hesitated at the door, torn between rushing to the Eva cages or rejoining Misato, but dashed back to the elevators, once again hitting the emergency override call button.  
当她按下袖口上的按钮给服装加压时，微弱的气流声被男孩的尖叫声和技师们的呼喊声淹没。真嗣！发生了什么？！明日香听到葛城队长命令发射平台的螺栓释放，但战斗的其余部分在她冲出更衣室时被遗忘了；她在门口几乎犹豫了一下，纠结于冲向 EVA 笼子还是回到美里身边，但最终还是跑回电梯，再次按下紧急呼叫按钮。

_Come on, come on, come on, come on!_ Asuka resisted the urge to activate the intercom and demand an update on the fight—unlike the cages, the locker rooms, and a few other areas, the elevators did not receive an audio feed from the operations center, even during alerts. Regardless, the car swiftly carried her back up to her destination, and it was a short moment before she was loping down the hallway and through the doors of the operations center.  
快点，快点，快点，快点！明日香强忍着不去激活对讲机，要求更新战斗情况——与笼子、更衣室和其他几个区域不同，电梯即使在警报期间也没有从指挥中心接收音频信号。尽管如此，电梯还是迅速将她送回了目的地，片刻之后，她便快步穿过走廊，进入了指挥中心的大门。

What greeted her was a room in barely contained chaos. The large displays showed the pointed, eight sided, crystalline, blue polygon floating menacingly in the middle of the city that Asuka had expected; it also had a long channel extending into the earth from its downward facing point, marked with teeth and grooves that made it appear like a drill bit.  
映入眼帘的是一个几乎失控的混乱房间。巨大的显示屏上显示着明日香预料中的那个尖锐的八边形、晶体状的蓝色多边形，它悬浮在城市中央，显得咄咄逼人；同时，它还有一个从向下尖端延伸到地下的长通道，布满了齿痕和凹槽，看起来就像一个钻头。

What she did not see was Unit 01, which she expected based off of what she had heard of the battle. But neither did she see Unit 00, which she did not expect. She jogged over to Misato, who was staring at the Angel on screen, labelled "Ramiel" by the Magi. She had one arm wrapped over her midsection and the other angled up, chin grasped in her hand.  
她没有看到初号机，这是她根据战斗情况所预料到的。但她也没有看到零号机，这是她未曾预料到的。她小跑向美里，美里正盯着屏幕上的使徒，由 MAGI 系统标记为“雷米尔”。她一只手臂环抱着腹部，另一只手向上抬起，手指轻触下巴。

"Misato?" Asuka asked her, sounding more harried than she had intended.  
"美里？" 明日香问她，声音比她预想的还要焦急。

"Asuka," she replied as she turned to face her. "The Angel opened fire on Unit 01 as soon as he launched. Some kind of beam—I don't know the details, ask Rits, but it tore right through Shinji's AT field. Like it wasn't even there." She placed a reassuring hand on Asuka's shoulder when the girl's eyes widened involuntarily as the news. "He's injured but stable. He'll be fine, and Unit 01 will be ready to redeploy soon. But we aren't launching again until we have a plan."  
"明日香，" 她转过身来面对她回答道。"那个使徒一发射就向初号机开火了。某种光束——具体我不清楚，问律子吧，但它直接穿透了真嗣的 AT 力场，就像那里根本不存在一样。" 看到明日香听到这个消息时眼睛不由自主地睁大，她安慰地把手放在明日香的肩膀上。"他受了伤但情况稳定。他会没事的，初号机很快就能重新部署。但在我们制定出计划之前，不会再出击了。"

_The plan last time was a positron rifle. I remember reading that in the reports._ "Do we have any ideas to start with?" She brushed Misato's hand off of her shoulder.  
上次的计划是用阳电子步枪。我记得在报告里读到过。"我们有什么初步的想法吗？" 她把美里的手从肩膀上拂开。

The older woman shook her head. "I appreciate your help Asuka, really, but I want you with the other pilots. Link up with Rei, try to get some rest or something during this downtime." Asuka made to interrupt with her own opinion on that proposal but was cut off. "This is more important than having one more person brainstorming up here. Remember what we talked about last night?"  
年长的女人摇了摇头。“我很感激你的帮助，明日香，真的，但我希望你和其他驾驶员在一起。和丽联系上，试着在这段空闲时间里休息一下什么的。”明日香正要插话表达自己对这个提议的看法，却被打断了。“这比再多一个人在这里集思广益更重要。记得我们昨晚谈过的吗？”

_She's not wrong_, Asuka agreed reluctantly, her angry retort dying in her throat. _And if she found a way to beat it once, she can do it again._ "We'll be on standby in the pilot ready room outside the cages. Or in the medical wing with the Third."  
她说的没错，明日香不情愿地同意了，她愤怒的反驳在喉咙里消散了。如果她曾找到过一次打败它的方法，她就能再做一次。“我们会在笼子外的驾驶员待命室待命。或者在医疗翼和第三适格者在一起。”

Misato offered her a weary smile and a brief nod. "Thanks, Asuka. Don't worry—we'll beat this thing, no problem!"  
美里给了她一个疲惫的微笑和一个简短的点头。“谢谢你，明日香。别担心——我们会打败这东西的，没问题！”

Asuka nodded and turned to leave. _I've got even more time to spend with Ayanami now. Lucky me. Maybe I can convince her that we need to take a nap or something._  
明日香点点头，转身离开。现在我有更多时间可以和绫波在一起了。真是幸运。也许我能说服她我们需要小睡一会儿什么的。

### Chapter 9

Τις είναι θέλεις σαυτώ πρώτον ειπέ. Είθ' ούτως ποίει ά ποιείς. (First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to do.) — Epitctetus  
Τις είναι θέλεις σαυτώ πρώτον ειπέ. Είθ' ούτως ποίει ά ποιείς. (先对自己说你想成为什么样的人；然后做你必须做的事。) — 爱比克泰德

_Nine white harpies circled overhead, glistening red tongues working across grotesque, toothy smiles in anticipation. Pinned to the ground by her enemies' weapons, Asuka desperately reached toward them. She strained her arm upward as the beasts descended, circling, their wingspans filling her vision as they approached. Finally, one strayed close enough to her frantic, grasping hand, and she caught its throat tightly in her fist.  
九只白色哈比在头顶盘旋，闪亮的红舌在怪异、满是利齿的笑容上蠕动，充满期待。被敌人的武器钉在地上，明日香拼命向它们伸出手。她竭力向上伸展手臂，随着这些生物俯冲而下，盘旋着，它们的翼展填满了她的视野。最终，一只偏离了群体，靠近了她狂乱抓握的手，她紧紧地抓住了它的喉咙。_

_The young girl seized the stuffed toy to her chest in a brutal grip, her face a hard mask of dark determination and loathing. She pulled the doll's head from its body and dropped the mutilated gift to the floor, stomping on the corpse. Soft white stuffing muffled the sound of her footfall and spilled out of the carcass. "Toys are for children. I hate toys." She raised her head to confront the woman she hated.  
年轻女孩紧紧抓住毛绒玩具贴在胸前，力度之大仿佛要将它撕裂，脸上是一副坚毅而憎恶的冷酷面具。她将玩偶的头从身体上扯下，丢弃在地，践踏着这残破的礼物。柔软的白色填充物减弱了她的脚步声，从残骸中溢出。“玩具是给孩子的。我讨厌玩具。”她抬起头，直面她所憎恨的女人。_

_With her gaze levelled, Asuka met her own eyes in the mirror. Her hands were clenched on either side of the basin of a sink in an empty washroom buried beneath the Geofront. Water was flowing out of the tap, the susurration a sorely welcomed distraction from her body's betrayal. The recurring pain was subsiding, but the agony she most keenly felt was not physical. "I'm useless," she muttered, squeezing her eyes shut against unshed tears.  
目光平视，明日香在镜中看到了自己的眼睛。她的双手紧握着地下 Geofront 深处一间空荡荡洗手间的水槽两侧。水龙头的水不断流出，那潺潺声响成了她身体背叛之痛中难得的慰藉。反复的疼痛正在消退，但她最深切的痛苦并非来自肉体。“我无用，”她喃喃自语，紧闭双眼，强忍着未流下的泪水。_

_She curled into herself on top of her bed, her roommate's footsteps sounding his trek to his own bedroom while their guardian, oblivious, blacked out, snored in her quarters. Asuka sought out the fury she urgently needed to banish the shame and heartache that was currently plaguing her. Her old ally, however, did not answer the call. Having laid herself bare, she had been rejected. Just as she knew she would be. As she always would be. A muted sob escaped her throat as her fingers, unbidden, lightly traced her lips. The contact only served to highlight the cold, longing feeling.  
她蜷缩在自己的床上，室友的脚步声预示着他正走向自己的卧室，而她们的监护人，浑然不觉，已经醉倒，鼾声如雷。明日香迫切需要愤怒来驱散此刻缠绕她的羞愧与心痛。然而，这位旧日盟友并未回应她的呼唤。她已将自己全然展露，却遭到了拒绝。正如她所预料的那样。也正如她一直以来的遭遇。一声压抑的呜咽从她喉间逸出，她的手指不由自主地轻抚过自己的唇。这触碰只是突显了那份冰冷而渴望的感觉。_

_The oppressive heat and pressure closed in on her, the red glow of the magma visible even with her eyes tightly shut. "I did it, but it doesn't even matter," she whispered. She could feel herself dropping down, the pressure incrementally growing with the depth. With a sigh, she accepted her fate, sinking into the familiar comfort of the entry plug. "Will you be waiting for me, Momma?"  
压抑的热浪与压力向她逼近，即使紧闭双眼，她仍能看见岩浆那猩红的光芒。“我做到了，但这又有什么意义呢？”她低语。她能感觉到自己在下沉，随着深度增加，压力逐渐增强。叹息一声，她接受了命运，沉入那熟悉的插入栓的慰藉中。“妈妈，你会等我吗？”_

Asuka's eyes fluttered open in consciousness, and she rose calmly, swinging her legs off of the cot she had been laying on to sit up. She was no stranger to peculiar dreams these days—in fact, she welcomed them, considering ever since her "return" they had stood in for her recurring nightmares about losing her mother. _I'm sure knowing that Momma is watching out for me in Unit 02 is responsible for this particular reprieve._ She began her normal waking routine of not examining her subconscious' torments, burying them under the weight of thinking about literally anything else.  
明日香的眼眸缓缓睁开，意识逐渐清晰，她平静地起身，将双腿从躺着的简易床上移开，坐了起来。这些天，她对那些奇特的梦境已不再陌生——事实上，她甚至欢迎它们，因为自从她的“归来”后，这些梦境取代了她反复梦见的关于失去母亲的噩梦。我确信，知道妈妈在 02 号机中守护着我，是这次解脱的缘由。她开始按照惯例，不去深究潜意识中的痛苦，而是将它们埋藏在思考其他任何事情的重压之下。

A quick glance around the pilot's ready room revealed that she was the sole occupant, despite the First Child being with her before she had fallen asleep. After leaving the operations center, she had returned to the locker rooms to wait for her comrade, then informed her of the need for sleep while they could get it. Rei, unsurprisingly, had agreed, and the pair had laid down in separate cots in the sparsely furnished room provided for the pilot's comfort during times when they would need to be on standby for immediate deployment.  
她迅速环顾了一下驾驶员准备室，发现自己是唯一的 occupant，尽管在她入睡之前，第一适格者还和她在一起。离开作战中心后，她回到了更衣室等待她的战友，然后告诉她，趁着能休息的时候抓紧时间。丽，不出所料地同意了，两人便在为驾驶员提供的、陈设简陋的房间里分别躺在了各自的简易床上，以备随时待命。

While there was no blue haired pilot in the room with her, she did spy a few new residents that had not been present before her nap. A note was sitting on the small, round table in the center of the room, a can of soda and a bag of chips accompanying it. Asuka rose from her uncomfortable sleeping spot, made just that much more uncomfortable by sleeping in her plugsuit, and stepped over to the table, stretching her arms over her head and flexing her back to work out the kinks she had developed.  
虽然房间里没有蓝发的驾驶员，但她确实发现了一些新面孔，这些人在她小憩之前并不在场。一张纸条放在房间中央的小圆桌上，旁边还有一罐汽水和一袋薯片。明日香从她那因穿着插入栓服睡觉而变得更加不舒服的睡眠地点起身，走到桌前，伸了个懒腰，活动了一下背部，以缓解她积累的僵硬。

She reached for the soda, popping it open with a _kshh_ that split the silence of the room, and read over the paper.  
她伸手去拿汽水，啪的一声打开，打破了房间的寂静，然后阅读了纸条上的内容。

_Dornröschen, 睡美人，_

_I figured you could do with the sleep, so I didn't wake you. Besides, I didn't have a handsome prince on hand to give you true love's kiss, since Shin-chan is still resting in the hospital (Misato had inserted a crudely drawn picture of a figure vaguely identifiable as a woman, prone, with red hair and a red dress (_"Where did she get a red pen? Does she just carry one around for stupid shit like this?"_) while another figure, male, wearing bulky, absurdly disproportionate purple armor with green accents (_"And she's got purple and green?!"_) leaned over the woman, his head obscuring her face and a cloud of stylized hearts surrounding them. Asuka scoffed but kept reading). We've got a plan to deal with the Angel, but I needed Ayanami's help with a procurement issue. It's a lot easier to convince someone to hand things over when you've got an Evangelion standing behind you!_  
我想你可能需要睡眠，就没叫醒你。再说了，我手边也没有英俊的王子来给你真爱之吻，毕竟新酱还在医院里休息（美里插入了一张潦草绘制的图片，图中一个勉强能辨认出是女性的身影躺着，红发红裙（“她从哪儿弄来的红笔？难道她随身带着就是为了画这种蠢东西？”），而另一个男性形象，身着笨重、比例夸张的紫色盔甲，带有绿色装饰（“她居然还有紫色和绿色？！”），正俯身在女性上方，头部遮住了她的脸，周围环绕着风格化的爱心。明日香嗤之以鼻，但还是继续读了下去）。我们有一个对付使徒的计划，但我需要绫波的帮助来解决采购问题。当你身后站着一台 EVA 时，说服别人交出东西就容易多了！

_When we get back I'll brief you on your part, so sit tight for now. Don't do anything I wouldn't do!  
我们回来后我会向你简述你的任务，所以现在先耐心等待。别做任何我不会做的事！_

_XOXO_

_Misato_

"The point of Sleeping Beauty was that she didn't wake up alone, you drunk, did you even read the story?" Asuka asked the empty room from around the bag of chips as she used her teeth to rip it open, still holding her drink with one hand. She upended the open bag, tilting it towards her mouth to catch a few of the chips. She wrinkled her nose at the taste, but chewed and swallowed anyway, the memory of her satisfying lunch being far behind her. "Stupid Japanese with their gross chips. Who wants squid flavored chips?"  
“睡美人的重点是她不是一个人醒来的，你这个醉鬼，你到底有没有读过这个故事？”明日香对着空荡荡的房间问道，她正用牙齿撕开一袋薯片，一手还拿着饮料。她将开口的袋子倒过来，倾斜着让几片薯片落入嘴里。她皱了皱鼻子，对这味道不太满意，但还是嚼了嚼咽了下去，毕竟满足的午餐记忆早已远去。“这些讨厌的日本人，他们的薯片真恶心。谁会想要鱿鱼味的薯片啊？”

Asuka quickly finished off the rest of the bag, draining the can of soda (_Green tea flavored?! Misato, you're banned from getting me snacks ever again_) afterwards to banish the taste. While tossing the remains of her impromptu refreshment into a garbage can across the room, Asuka considered making her way to the dining facility to acquire more substantial food. _Better not_, she advised herself while she made her way to exit the room anyway, _we're deploying soon._ _Full stomachs don't play well with LCL and the rigors of combat._  
明日香迅速吃完了剩下的薯片，随后喝干了那罐绿茶味的汽水（绿茶味？！美里，你以后别再给我买零食了），试图驱散那股味道。她将临时零食的残余扔进房间另一头的垃圾桶，考虑着是否该去食堂找些更实在的食物。还是算了吧，她一边走向出口一边告诫自己，我们很快就要出击了。吃饱了肚子可不适合 LCL 和战斗的严酷。

Past the threshold, Asuka turned to peer down the short distance that led to the Eva cages where, she assumed, technicians were finishing the repairs to Unit 01's armor. _That, or prepping it for transport. The location of Unit 01's firing position was one of the few things_ not _redacted from the report on the battle against the Fifth Angel that I'd had access to._ She shook her head, ignoring how her overreliance on assumptions lately was making some of her more academically inclined senses tingle, and turned down the other side of the hallway.  
跨过门槛，明日香转身望向那段短距离，通向存放 Eva 的笼子，她猜测，技术人员应该正在完成对 01 号机装甲的修复工作。或者，是在为运输做准备。关于对抗第五使徒的战斗报告中，01 号机的发射位置是少数未被删减的部分之一，我有权查阅。她摇了摇头，忽略了近期过度依赖假设让她的学术直觉隐隐作痛，转身走向走廊的另一侧。

Without conscious effort on her part, she found herself inside an elevator, being raised to the level that housed the medical wing. Still underground, of course; Asuka had rarely seen actual sunlight in the time since her early arrival in Japan, mostly the harsh electric lighting inside Central Dogma or, at best, the softer artificial attempt to mimic natural light in the open areas of the Geofront where she would sometimes conduct training.  
不知不觉中，她发现自己已身处电梯内，正被送往设有医疗翼的楼层。当然，依旧在地下；自从她初抵日本以来，明日香很少见到真正的阳光，大多是中央教条内部的刺眼灯光，或是地表开放区域试图模仿自然光的柔和人造光，她有时会在那里进行训练。

As the doors opened on her destined floor, Asuka strode towards a hapless man wearing scrubs with all the haughty confidence she could muster (quite a lot, of course). "The Third Child?" The imperiousness in her voice caused the man to look up from the clipboard he was reading over, his eyes displaying an irritation that Asuka could relate to, though was still trying her patience. _Yeah, yeah, your job sucks. Mine's worse. Get over it._  
当电梯门在她命运的楼层打开时，明日香带着她所能聚集的所有傲慢自信，大步走向一个穿着病号服的无助男子（当然，这自信相当多）。“第三适格者？”她声音中的威严让男子从正在查阅的病历板上抬起头来，眼中流露出的烦躁让明日香感同身受，尽管这仍让她有些不耐烦。是啊，是啊，你的工作很糟糕。我的更糟。克服它吧。

"He's recovering in Room 4. Down that hall, on your right," he informed her with a nod of his head down one of the corridors that branched off behind him. Asuka brushed past him as he returned to his notes, interaction complete. The too short walk down the hallway brought her to the Third Child's room. Out of sight of any passersby, Asuka hesitated at the door, hand tentatively raised to the doorknob but quickly dropped. She _huff_ed exasperatedly and crossed her arms over her chest.
“他在4号房间恢复。沿着那条走廊，在你的右边，”他一边点头示意身后分岔的一条走廊，一边告诉她。明日香从他身边擦过，他则回到自己的笔记上，互动结束。那段太短的走廊走完后，她来到了第三适格者的房间。在看不见任何路人的情况下，明日香在门前犹豫了一下，手试探性地伸向门把手，但很快又放下了。她懊恼地哼了一声，双臂交叉在胸前。

_I'm just checking on a fellow pilot. That's all, no reason to get so worked up._ She stepped to one side of the door, smoothly turning to face the opposite wall while simultaneously falling back to lean casually against the wall behind her. _I told Misato I would check on him, so that's why I'm here._ She nonchalantly swung her head from side to side, taking in the corridor devoid of anything besides the occasional bench or plastic shrub.  
我只是来看看同僚飞行员，没别的意思，别这么激动。她轻盈地挪到门边一侧，顺势转身面向对面的墙壁，同时自然地后仰靠在背后的墙上。我答应过美里会来看看他，所以我来了。她漫不经心地左右摇头，打量着空荡荡的走廊，除了偶尔的长椅或塑料灌木外别无他物。

_It's my responsibility as the ranking pilot to ensure that he is recovering properly. Misato made it clear, in word and deed, that she's incapable of taking care of the pilots._ Asuka unfolded her right arm and brought her hand up to her face, fingers curled into her palm, inspecting her nails. _This added responsibility all lines up perfectly with my plans anyway._ She returned her arm to its previous position. _So just do it!_  
作为首席飞行员，我有责任确保他恢复得当。美里无论是言语还是行动上都表明了她无法照顾好飞行员。明日香展开右臂，将手举到脸前，手指弯曲握拳，检查着自己的指甲。这份额外的责任恰好与我的计划完美契合。她将手臂恢复原位。所以，就这么办吧！

With another _huff_, she pushed off from the wall and faced her challenger once again. Her anger renewed, if only slightly, and perhaps partially directed at herself, she did not hesitate at the doorknob, twisting it firmly and shoving her way into the room, ready to confront the Third Child for his crimes.  
她再次哼了一声，从墙上起身，再次面对挑战者。尽管怒气只是稍稍重燃，或许还夹杂着对自己的不满，但她毫不犹豫地转动门把手，坚定地推门而入，准备就他的罪行与第三适格者对峙。

"I swear, Idiot, if you—" Her tirade was halted when she took in the sight the room had to offer: Shinji, laying asleep in a hospital bed and wearing a serene face that she so rarely saw on him. _Oh, come on!_ Her anger prematurely defused, Asuka impotently stared at him as she slowly walked up next to the bed. _This isn't fair. He just looks helpless. And happy. And pathetic. And—AARRGGHH! Stop it! You need to focus, Soryu! Stop letting those perverts mess with your head._  
“我发誓，笨蛋，如果你——”她的怒斥在看到房间里的景象时戛然而止：真嗣，安详地躺在医院床上熟睡，脸上挂着她鲜少见到的宁静表情。哦，拜托！怒气过早消散，明日香无力地盯着他，缓缓走到床边。这不公平。他看起来那么无助。还那么快乐。又那么可怜。还——啊啊啊！停下来！你需要集中注意力，惣流！别再让那些变态扰乱你的思绪。

With something new to be angry about, Asuka's sense of purpose was refreshed. She cleared her throat loudly, the exaggerated _AHEM_ breaking the silence of the room. The Third Child did not react, oblivious to the rising storm in his slumbering state. "Third!" She snapped, louder than she had cleared her throat. Not loud enough, it seemed, to have her desired effect. She reached a hand out towards the sleeping boy, redirecting it to his shoulder when it drifted further down along his arm than she had intended. Hand safely gripped on his shoulder, she shook him, not harshly but certainly not gently, though it only served to cause the boy to furrow his brow in his sleep and mutter something quietly that she couldn't quite make out.  
有了新的怒火对象，明日香的目的感焕然一新。她大声清了清喉咙，夸张的“啊哼”打破了房间的寂静。第三适格者毫无反应，沉睡中对即将到来的风暴浑然不觉。“第三！”她厉声喝道，比刚才清喉咙的声音还要大。但似乎还不够响亮，未能达到她预期的效果。她伸出手朝熟睡的男孩探去，当手沿着他的手臂滑下比她预想的更远时，她及时将手移到了他的肩膀上。手稳稳地抓着他的肩膀，她摇晃着他，不算粗暴但也绝非温柔，然而这仅仅让男孩在睡梦中皱起眉头，低声咕哝着什么，她没能听清楚。

Asuka withdrew her hand and glared menacingly at him, crossing her arms over her chest again. "Wake _up_, Idiot!" She punctuated her growl with the delivery of a strong kick to the nearby leg of the bed. The bed slid half a meter at an awkward angle, accompanied by a ringing _screech_ of metal being forcefully dragged across _whatever-NERV-made-the-floors-in-this-place-out-of_ and the boy's return to consciousness.  
明日香收回手，恶狠狠地瞪着他，再次交叉双臂抱在胸前。“醒醒，白痴！”她咆哮着，用力踢向床边的一根床腿。床滑动了半米，角度别扭，伴随着金属被强行拖过 NERV 所用地板材料的刺耳尖叫声，男孩也随之苏醒过来。

"Huwhuah?" Shinji yelped intelligently as he jolted up slightly from his supine position, eyes open wide and darting around the room. They settled on the incensed redhead, and he smiled tentatively. "Asuka, wh—"  
"呼哇？" 真嗣机智地惊叫一声，从仰卧的姿势微微弹起，眼睛睁得大大的，四处扫视房间。目光最终落在愤怒的红发少女身上，他试探性地笑了笑。"明日香，怎——"

"Good, you're awake. I'm here to check on your recovery," she interrupted, breaking her stare as she stomped towards the foot of the bed. Once settled there, she resumed her glare, which Shinji was returning with a look that belied a mix of confusion and embarrassment. He had a slight blush effusing his cheeks.  
"很好，你醒了。我来检查你的恢复情况，" 她打断道，移开视线，大步走向床尾。一到达那里，她又恢复了瞪视，而真嗣则带着一种混杂着困惑和尴尬的表情回视她。他的脸颊微微泛红。

"Oh, uh, I'm fine. Mostly," he assured her. "The doctors said it's psych—"  
"哦，呃，我没事。基本上，" 他向她保证。"医生说这是心理——"

He was interrupted, again, this time by Asuka grabbing onto the end of the bed and crudely jerking it back into its previous position. The bed voiced its protest at being moved, again, and its occupant cringed at the sound. "Psychosomatic pain? No other injuries?"  
他又被打断了，这次是明日香抓住床尾，粗暴地将床拖回原位。床再次发出被移动的抗议声，床上的人听到这声音不禁皱眉。“心理作用引起的疼痛？没有其他伤吗？”

"No, just the pain." Shinji scooted back slightly to sit up fully, bunching up the sheet puddled at his waist in his fists and casting his eyes around to avoid Asuka's interrogative scowl. "Erm, is something wrong?"  
“没有，只有疼痛。”真嗣稍微向后挪动，坐直身子，将堆在腰间的床单紧紧抓在手中，目光四处游移以避开明日香审视的怒视。“呃，有什么问题吗？”

_You, you dumbass!_ "Oh, no, it's just that _you're in the fucking hospital_! What the hell happened, Third?! I heard you get hit, then—" _Then I took a nap. And had a snack. Fuck. Way to go, Soryu. You're as bad as the sot. Why didn't you check on your pilot first?_ She maintained her stranglehold on the railing at the foot of the bed, the metal being a safer target for her ire. _Being tired isn't an excuse. Misato saying he'd be fine isn't an excuse._  
你这个笨蛋！“哦，不，只是你他妈的在医院里！到底发生了什么，三号机？！我听说你被击中了，然后——”然后我小睡了一会儿。还吃了点零食。该死。说得好，惣流。你和那个酒鬼一样糟糕。你为什么不先去看看你的驾驶员？她紧紧抓住床尾的栏杆，金属比她的怒火更安全。累了不是借口。美里说他没事也不是借口。

"Oh." Shinji's blush deepened, the boy apparently interpreting her abrupt cutoff as indicative of something that, as was becoming a habit, Asuka was not going to think about. She had things to be enraged about instead. "I—well, that is, we got the alert that an Angel had appeared, and Misato-san ordered me to launch immediately." Asuka waited _very patiently_ for the boy to get through the obvious recitation of events and into what she did not already know, _very calmly_ fighting the urge to storm back over to his side, turn him upside down, and shake the story out of him like she was emptying a bag of squid flavored chips. The air practically vibrated with her patience and calmness.  
“哦。”真嗣的脸更红了，显然他将她的突然打断解读为某种迹象，而这种迹象，正逐渐成为一种习惯，即明日香不愿去思考的事情。她有其他事情需要愤怒。“我——呃，也就是说，我们收到了使徒出现的警报，美里小姐命令我立即出击。”明日香极其耐心地等待着男孩说完这些显而易见的事件，进入她尚未知晓的部分，她非常平静地克制着冲回他身边，将他倒过来，像倒空一袋鱿鱼味薯片一样摇出他的故事的冲动。空气中几乎弥漫着她的耐心与平静。

"She said that Ayanami-san would be launching in Unit 00 soon, and not to engage unless necessary until she got there. But, uh, as soon as I stepped off the launch platform, I barely got two more steps before—" Shinji grimaced, still not meeting her eyes, though Asuka couldn't tell if it was from shame, embarrassment, pain, or some combination thereof. "Someone was yelling about energy readings, and I reacted. I put up Unit 01's AT field," he snuck a quick glance up to Asuka, who remained mostly unreadable aside from her mask of irritation, "but it wasn't much use."  
"她说绫波同学很快就会驾驶零号机出击，让我们除非必要不要轻举妄动，等她到了再说。但是，呃，我刚走下发射平台，还没迈出两步就——" 真嗣皱着眉，依旧没有直视她的眼睛，尽管明日香无法分辨这是出于羞愧、尴尬、痛苦，还是几种情绪的混合。"有人在大喊能量读数异常，我本能地反应了。我展开了初号机的 AT 力场，"他快速瞥了一眼明日香，后者除了那副恼怒的面具外，几乎看不出其他表情，"但似乎没什么用。"

Shinji brought one hand to his bare chest, gingerly prodding at the unblemished skin with a wince. Asuka's grip, somehow, tightened. "And?"  
真嗣用一只手抚上自己赤裸的胸膛，小心翼翼地戳了戳完好无损的皮肤，眉头微皱。明日香的手，不知怎的，握得更紧了。"然后呢？"

"The Angel has some kind of energy beam thing? It hit Unit 01 right in the chest. It—um, it hurt, and I fell down." Shinji returned to gripping his sheets and looking at his hands. "I guess I landed on the platform, and they dropped it back down, but it's all kind of a blur until I ended up here. The doctor said the AT field was enough to protect the LCL in the entry plug from being boiled, so I was lucky to be uninjured physically. Sorry I screwed up," he added morosely.  
"使徒有一种能量光束之类的东西？它直接击中了初号机的胸口。那——呃，很痛，我就摔倒了。" 真嗣又回到了紧抓床单、盯着双手的状态。"我想我是摔在了平台上，他们就把我放回去了，但之后的事都模模糊糊的，直到我在这里醒来。医生说 AT 力场足够保护插入栓里的 LCL 不被煮沸，所以我算是幸运的，身体上没有受伤。对不起，我搞砸了。"他沮丧地补充道。"

"Don't apologize." Her quick retort hit the boy harshly. He jerked his head to the side, away from Asuka, who was regretting her instinctual response. "Look, Third," she sighed as she let go of the railing, almost surprised at the lack of indentations in the metal from her grasp, "No one could have known the Angel would be able to strike so quickly, or so strongly." _Except for me. Was that in the report I read? I don't think it was, there was so much redacted, but at the time I wasn't—ugh, now isn't the time for self-flagellation, Soryu!_  
"别道歉。" 她的迅速反驳重重地击中了男孩。他猛地将头转向一边，远离了后悔自己本能反应的明日香。"听着，三号，" 她叹了口气，松开了扶手，几乎惊讶于金属上没有留下她的抓痕，"没人能预料到使徒会如此迅速、如此强烈地攻击。" 除了我。那是我读过的报告里提到的吗？我不这么认为，报告中有太多被删节的部分，但当时我并没有——呃，现在不是自我惩罚的时候，Soryu！

Asuka walked over to the bedside chair she had ignored when she initially stormed the room, dropping into it heavily. She noticed Shinji following her movement out of the corner of his eye, still not turning back to face her. "Let's just look at the facts: you're not hurt, physically, at least, and Unit 01 took minimal damage and will be ready to deploy against the Angel again soon. If it isn't already."  
明日香走到她最初冲进房间时忽视的床边椅子旁，重重地坐下。她注意到真嗣用眼角余光跟随着她的动作，仍旧没有转过身来面对她。"让我们看看事实：你至少没有受伤，身体上，至少，初号机只受到了轻微损伤，很快就能再次投入对抗使徒的战斗。如果它还没准备好的话。"

"I guess so," Shinji muttered, finally looking back at Asuka. "It's just that this was my first time fighting for real since I started training with you, and I let everyone down, and I know you would have done better, and I don't—"  
"我想是的，" 真嗣喃喃道，终于回头看向明日香。"只是这是我自从开始和你训练以来第一次真正战斗，我让大家失望了，我知道你能做得更好，而我不知——"

"Oh, just _shut up_, Third," Asuka growled. She gave him no time to sulk in that rebuke before pressing on. "What are you, stupid? You did fine, ok? That's the point I was trying to make. Your AT field took the brunt of the attack, your _evasive maneuvers_ spared you any lasting damage, _and_ Misato already has a plan to deal with the Angel. Any failure in the initial operation isn't down to your piloting, it's because of a lack of knowledge on NERV's part regarding the Angels." _More like a lack of preparation on my part. I'll do better moving forward—I have to. The fight with the Sixth Angel will go_ way _differently. All it took was a phone call. I can't believe I let them ship my Unit 02 over the ocean without C-type equipment last time!_  
"哦，闭嘴，三号，" 明日香咆哮道。她没给他时间沉浸在那句反驳中，便继续说道。"你是不是傻？你做得很好，明白吗？这就是我想说的。你的 AT 力场承受了攻击的大部分冲击，你的闪避动作让你免受了持久伤害，而且美里已经有了对付使徒的计划。初次作战的任何失败都不是因为你驾驶技术的问题，而是 NERV 对使徒了解不足。" 更像是我的准备不足。我会在前进中做得更好——我必须如此。与第六使徒的战斗将会截然不同。只需一个电话就能解决。我真不敢相信上次他们居然在没有 C 型装备的情况下就把我的二号机运过了大洋！

Shinji blushed at the oblique praise but smiled and did not look away. "Thanks, Asuka," he told her softly. "I—"  
真嗣因这隐晦的赞扬而脸红，但他微笑着没有移开视线。"谢谢你，明日香，" 他轻声对她说。"我——"

"Knock knock! I'm not interrupting anything inappropriate, am I?" A voice interrupted, accompanied by the operations director's head poking through the partly opened doorway. "Oh, good, I knew I heard you in hear, Asuka." Misato entered the room fully, shouldering the door the rest of the way open. One hand held a folder stuffed with loose papers while the other raked through her hair.  
"咚咚！我没打扰到什么不合适的事情吧？" 一个声音打断了他们，伴随着操作主任的头从半开的门缝中探进来。"哦，太好了，我就知道我听到你在这里，明日香。" 美里完全走进房间，用肩膀把门完全推开。一只手拿着一个塞满散页的文件夹，另一只手则梳理着她的头发。

"Dealing with JSSDF procurement officers is exhausting work, let me tell you. Actually, no, I won't tell you, I need you awake right now," she said with a sigh as she approached Asuka. "Seeing their faces when Unit 00 lifted the roof off of their warehouse was pretty funny, though." She grinned at the pilots, who gave her mirrored quizzical looks. "Oh, right, the briefing, you guys wouldn't know.  
"跟日本自卫队采购官员打交道真是累人，让我告诉你。实际上，不，我不会告诉你，我现在需要你保持清醒，" 她叹了口气，走向明日香。"不过，看到零号机掀掉他们仓库屋顶时他们的表情，真是太好笑了。" 她对着飞行员们咧嘴一笑，他们则回以同样困惑的表情。"哦，对了，简报，你们还不知道呢。

"Here." She handed her folder to Asuka, who took it and began rifling through its contents as the captain spoke. "I'll just cover your part of the plan for now, Asuka, you can read the rest while I finalize the positioning." Asuka skimmed over the first page in the folder, noting the phrase OPERATION YASHIMA printed throughout. _It seems to be about the same._ "You'll be piloting Unit 01 and firing the prototype weapon I just snagged from a JSSDF warehouse: a positron rifle. Which, when supplied with enough electricity, has the firepower needed to take out the Angel in one shot. The tricky part is charging the damn thing, but we've got that covered.  
"给。" 她将文件夹递给明日香，后者接过并开始翻阅其中的内容，同时队长继续说道。"我现在先讲解你的部分计划，明日香，你可以边看边听我最后确定位置。" 明日香快速浏览了文件夹的第一页，注意到上面印有 OPERATION YASHIMA 的字样。似乎没什么变化。"你将驾驶 01 号机并发射我从 JSSDF 仓库刚弄来的原型武器：一把阳电子步枪。只要供电充足，它的火力足以一击消灭使徒。难点在于充电，但我们已经解决了。

"While you take the shot in Unit 01, Ayanami will be providing cover for you in Unit 00. We expect the Angel to be able to detect the energy buildup of the rifle charging, though to mitigate that your firing position, while within the Angel's effective targeting range, is outside of the determined threat response range. Combined with the JSSDF and defensive emplacements providing some distractions, you should be able to take your shot without having to worry about counterfire."  
"当你在 01 号机中开火时，绫波将在 00 号机中为你提供掩护。我们预计使徒能够探测到步枪充电的能量积累，尽管为了减轻这一点，你的射击位置虽然处于使徒的有效瞄准范围内，但超出了其确定的威胁反应范围。再加上 JSSDF 和防御设施的干扰，你应该能在不用担心反击的情况下开火。"

Asuka nodded thoughtfully as she noted the details on the paper in her hands. "You said one shot will kill. What if it doesn't?"  
明日香若有所思地点点头，目光落在手中的纸上。“你说一枪就能致命。如果没打中呢？”

"It will," Misato assured her with the confidence of someone who knew how precariously things were balanced.  
“会的，”美里自信地向她保证，仿佛深知局势是多么微妙地维持着平衡。

Asuka scoffed in response, noting that not even Shinji had been inspired by their commander's faith. "Ok, fine. What if I miss, then?"  
明日香嗤之以鼻，注意到就连真嗣也没被指挥官的信念所打动。“好吧，好吧。那万一我失手了呢？”

"Don't miss," Misato blanched. "Unit 01 is being fitted with a targeting visor that will take data directly from the Magi, so all you have to do is hold the rifle steady and aim where it tells you. But the rifle takes at least 30 seconds to charge for each shot, and your firing position is fixed due to the charging infrastructure. And I don't think any amount of distraction will deter the Angel from responding to your fire, Asuka. Ayanami will be there to shield you during the reload, but I'd rather not have to rely on that."  
"别失误，" 美里脸色发白。"零号机配备了从 MAGI 直接获取数据的目标瞄准镜，你只需稳稳握住步枪，按照指示瞄准即可。但每次射击步枪至少需要 30 秒充电，且由于充电设施的限制，你的射击位置是固定的。而且我认为无论多少干扰都无法阻止使徒对你的射击做出反应，明日香。绫波会在你重新装填时保护你，但我实在不想依赖这一点。"

"Hmm," Asuka answered. _There was damage to Unit 00 in the first fight, so clearly I should expect to fire more than once—assuming the Angel really won't shoot first._ "What do you think, Third?"  
"嗯，" 明日香回应道。第一次战斗中零号机受损，显然我应该预计到不止开一枪——假设使徒真的不会先开火。"你怎么看，三号？"

Shinji blinked and offered a wide-eyed look. "Umm, me?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼，露出惊讶的表情。"呃，我吗？"

"Yes, _you_." _Come on, Idiot, use that brain of yours. You need to be able to think tactically, too, I can't be the only pilot thinking about ways to beat these things. And I suppose talking tactics and swapping ideas is another way to build cohesion in the Pilot Corps. Another thing I'll have to start doing with Ayanami. Ugh, the burdens I take on are only multiplying._ "You're a pilot. You've piloted against this Angel. I want to hear what you think."  
"是的，你。" 来吧，笨蛋，用用你的脑子。你也需要能够战术思考，我不能是唯一一个想着如何打败这些东西的驾驶员。我想，讨论战术和交换想法也是增强驾驶员团队凝聚力的一种方式。这是我必须开始和绫波做的事情。唉，我承担的责任只是越来越多。"你是驾驶员。你曾与这个使徒交战过。我想听听你的想法。"

"Well, uh—" He stammered. "I guess it sounds like a good plan," he said quietly. "But—" He cut himself off with a frown and looked back down at his hands, clenching one opened and closed.  
"嗯，呃——" 他结巴着说。"我觉得这个计划听起来不错，"他轻声说。"但是——" 他皱着眉头打断了自己，又低头看着自己的手，一开一合地握着。

"What is it, Shinji-kun?" Misato asked him, her tone reassuring and supportive. "Whatever you might think of your combat experience, you do have a valuable perspective to offer." She tentatively reached a hand out to Shinji's knee from her position standing next to Asuka but dropped it back down to her side without making contact.  
"怎么了，真嗣君？" 美里问他，语气安慰且支持。"无论你怎么看待你的战斗经验，你都有宝贵的视角可以提供。" 她从站在明日香旁边的位置试探性地伸出手去触碰真嗣的膝盖，但最终还是把手放回了身侧，没有真正接触到。

"I'm worried about if the Angel does shoot at Asuka and Ayanami-san." He looked up at his visitors and brought a hand up to poke at his chest again. "They won't be able to move from where they're shooting from, right? That means if it does shoot at them, they'll have to take the full force of the attack. I only got hit for a few seconds and—" He looked down at his naked chest again. "I guess falling backwards saved me, about as much as the AT field did. Do you know how long the Angel can keep up its attack, Misato-san? Will Asuka and Ayanami-san be ok if it does shoot at them?"  
"我担心那使徒会不会朝明日香和绫波开火。" 他抬头望向访客，再次抬起手戳了戳自己的胸口。"他们无法从射击位置移动，对吧？这意味着如果它真的开火，他们将不得不承受全部的攻击力。我只被击中了几秒钟——" 他低头看向自己赤裸的胸膛。"我想向后摔倒救了我，和 AT 力场差不多。美里小姐，你知道使徒能持续攻击多久吗？如果它真的开火，明日香和绫波会没事吗？"

Asuka's heart made an unfamiliar tightening feeling in her chest at the raw worry in the boy's voice and face while Misato gave a comforting smile. "I understand, Shinji-kun. It's good to be concerned; I am too. Everyone is. But it's a risk we have to take, and one we've done our best to minimize as much as possible. If it does attack, Ayanami will protect Asuka while she kills the Angel. Unit 00 will have a special shield that Doctor Akagi has assured me will be able to withstand the damage for as long as necessary." She put one hand on Asuka's shoulder, who resisted the urge to shrug it off, and gave it a firm squeeze. "Trust your friends, Shinji-kun."  
听到男孩声音和脸上那股真切的担忧，明日香的心中涌起一种陌生的紧缩感，而美里则露出了安慰的微笑。“我明白，真嗣君。关心是好事；我也很担心。大家都是。但这是我们必须承担的风险，我们已经尽了最大努力将其降到最低。如果它真的攻击，绫波会保护明日香，而她会消灭使徒。零号机会有一个赤木博士保证能承受必要时长的特殊护盾。”她将一只手放在明日香的肩上，后者强忍住甩开它的冲动，美里坚定地握了握她的肩膀。“相信你的朋友，真嗣君。”

Accepting, if not mollified, Shinji nodded glumly. "I do, Misato-san." Asuka's heart repeated its exotic maneuver.  
尽管没有完全释怀，真嗣还是沮丧地点了点头。“我会的，美里小姐。”明日香的心再次重复了那异样的跳动。

"Good. You get back to your rest, Shinji-kun. Asuka and I have a ride to catch. We'll be back later, and we'll tell you all about how we beat the Angel—I'll get them to let you come home, too. There's no reason to keep you cooped up in here if you're not hurt. I'll have someone bring you your clothes, too," she added with a smug grin. Shinji blushed again and covered his bare torso with the sheet, looking away from the two women. Asuka also reddened, diverting her eyes from the naked display she had not previously noticed.  
"很好。你回去休息吧，真嗣君。我和明日香还有个约会要赶。我们晚点回来，会告诉你我们是如何打败使徒的——我也会让他们让你回家的。如果你没受伤，就没理由把你关在这里。我还会让人把你的衣服送来。"她带着得意的笑容补充道。真嗣再次脸红，用床单遮住赤裸的上身，避开两位女士的目光。明日香也脸红了，转移视线，没有注意到之前未曾注意到的裸露场面。

"Good luck, Asuka," he said as the pilot rose from her chair.  
"祝你好运，明日香。"他说着，看着驾驶员从椅子上站起来。

"Luck has nothing to do with it, Third. I'm the best there is." Misato offered a parting smile to the boy, in contrast to Asuka's confident smirk, as they left his hospital room. She closed the door behind them with a sigh.  
"运气与此无关，第三适格者。我是最棒的。"美里向男孩露出告别的微笑，与明日香自信的冷笑形成对比，她们离开了他的病房。她关上门，叹了口气。

"He's a good kid," she said sadly as they walked down the hall. "I hate sending you guys out to fight these monsters. Hearing him talk like that makes me hate it even more. I just wish," she trailed off without finishing the thought.  
"他是个好孩子，"她悲伤地说着，两人走在走廊上。"我不喜欢派你们去对付那些怪物。听他那样说，我更讨厌了。我只是希望，"她话没说完就停下了。

"We're pilots, Misato," Asuka said flatly. _I have to fight. It's what I'm here for._  
"我们是驾驶员，美里，"明日香平淡地说。"我必须战斗。这就是我在这里的原因。

"I know," she replied exasperatedly. "It doesn't mean I have to like it. At least I can rely on you, Asuka. Thanks for checking on him." Misato again reached out for Asuka's shoulder. This time, she ducked the contact under the pretense of moving up to press the elevator call button.  
"我知道，"她无奈地回答。"这不代表我必须喜欢。至少我可以依靠你，明日香。谢谢你去关心他。"美里再次伸出手想搭在明日香肩上。这次，她借故上前按电梯呼叫按钮，避开了接触。

_Someone has to._ Someone _should have done it earlier._ "Is this ride going to the staging area, or am I moving Unit 01 to the surface?"  
总得有人去做。本该有人早点行动的。“这辆车是去集结区的，还是我要把初号机移到地面上？”

Misato rolled with the abrupt change in subject. "Staging area; I've got a truck standing by on the surface. I'll give you more details on the way over, but I covered pretty much everything you need to concern yourself with already. Let me know if you have any questions." The pair entered the elevator together.  
美里顺势接过话题的突变。“去集结区；我在地面上已经备好了一辆卡车。路上我会给你更多细节，不过我已经涵盖了你需要注意的大部分内容。有任何问题随时告诉我。”两人一同走进电梯。

Ω

Asuka stood atop the scaffolding that had been erected around the pair of Evangelions, Units 01 and 00, standing ready along the road that lead to the firing position. She leaned against the railing and observed the last straggling vehicles departing down the path from the top of the mountain, the mountain itself blocking her view of most of the city and the Angel that hovered ominously over it. On a separate platform, closer to Unit 00, the First Child sat with her arms wrapped around her knees, which she had drawn up to her chest. Her white plugsuit caught the light of the moon and stars, which shone clear and bright in the nationwide blackout, making her stand out next to the Second Child's darker colored red plugsuit.  
明日香站在围绕着两台福音战士——初号机和零号机搭建的脚手架顶端，它们沿着通往发射位置的道路严阵以待。她倚靠在栏杆上，观察着最后几辆车辆从山顶小径撤离，山体本身挡住了她对城市和悬停其上的使徒的大部分视线。在靠近零号机的另一个平台上，第一适格者双臂环抱着膝盖，蜷缩成一团坐着。她的白色插入栓服在月光和星光下闪耀，这些光芒在全国停电中显得格外清晰明亮，使她与第二适格者深红色的插入栓服形成鲜明对比。

Neither pilot had spoken since Asuka had arrived several minutes earlier; Asuka was still mulling over her part in the night's main event, while, as far as she could tell, Rei seemed content to let her do so in silence. Never having learned to leave well enough alone, however, the more temperamental of the two inevitably turned her attention to her taciturn teammate.  
自绫波到来已有几分钟，两位驾驶员都未曾开口；明日香仍在思索她在今晚主要事件中的角色，而就她所见，绫波似乎乐于让她在沉默中思考。然而，从未学会适可而止的明日香，终究还是将注意力转向了她那位沉默寡言的队友。

"This will be your first combat sortie, First. You ready?" Asuka continued to watch the vehicles far below her ponderously move to safety, their role in the operation already complete.  
“这将是你的首次实战飞行，一航战。准备好了吗？”明日香继续注视着下方缓缓驶向安全地带的车辆，它们在行动中的任务已经完成。

"I will perform as ordered." Rei also maintained her gaze, not looking away from the unobstructed section of the city laid out before them.  
“我会按命令执行。”绫波同样保持着目光，没有从展现在他们面前的城市无遮挡区域移开视线。

Asuka scoffed loudly in response. _And there it is. What is wrong with her?_ "As ordered. Of course you will." She was intimately familiar with every facet of Operation Yashima, having dissected the operation order Misato had given her and questioned the woman on the finer points of the plan while they had made their way out of the Geofront. _You'll stand there with that scrounged up space shuttle heat shield waiting to jump in front of a particle beam._ Silence stretched between the pilots as Asuka considered her previous conclusion to foster a closer relationship with her fellow pilot than she had previously enjoyed.  
明日香大声嗤之以鼻作为回应。果然如此。她有什么问题？“遵命。当然你会的。”她对“八岛行动”的每一个细节都了如指掌，已经仔细研读了美里交给她的行动指令，并在离开地底空洞的路上向美里询问了计划的细节。你将站在那里，拿着那块拼凑起来的航天飞机热盾，等待着跳到粒子束前。两位驾驶员之间陷入了沉默，明日香在思考她之前得出的结论，即与她的同伴建立比以往更紧密的关系。

_Just start with something you know she'll get. Any kind of conversation is enough of a step in the right direction, right? She likes orders, like a good little doll—no, no more of that. You've been over this. She's_ comfortable _with orders, so we can talk about the operation without sniping at each other._ Asuka turned to face her comrade, leaning her hip against the railing and keeping her face carefully neutral.  
就从你知道她会理解的事情开始吧。任何形式的对话都是朝着正确方向迈出的一步，对吧？她喜欢命令，像个乖巧的玩偶——不，不能再这样了。你已经考虑过这一点。她对命令感到自在，所以我们可以讨论行动而不互相攻击。明日香转向她的同伴，将臀部靠在栏杆上，脸上保持着中立的表情。

"You want to go over our part in this charade one more time, make sure we're on the same page?"  
“你想再过一遍我们在这场闹剧中的角色，确保我们步调一致吗？”

Rei's eyes flicked over to Asuka. She nodded her head minutely after a brief moment. "At 2330 hours tonight, Evangelion Units 01 and 00 will proceed to the designated position atop Mount Futago. You will pilot Unit 01 and emplace the positron rifle, where it will then be connected to the assembled banks of capacitors that are currently charging. I will pilot Unit 00, in position with the makeshift Eva Anti-Heat and Light Wave Defensive Equipment. At 0000 hours tomorrow morning, Operation Yashima will commence: you will fire the positron rifle at the designated target and destroy it. Recovery operations will follow, to be directed by Captain Katsuragi." She returned her attention to the darkened city.  
绫波的目光迅速扫向明日香。片刻后，她微不可察地点了点头。“今晚 23 时 30 分，初号机与零号机将前往二上山指定位置。你将驾驶初号机并安置阳电子步枪，随后该步枪将与正在充电的电容器组连接。我将驾驶零号机，配备临时 EVA 防热与光波防御装备。明晨零时，'八咫镜行动'将启动：你将用阳电子步枪瞄准目标并予以摧毁。后续回收行动将由葛城 captain 指挥。”她重新将注意力转向那座昏暗的城市。

_Ok, so she can memorize well. I already knew that._ Asuka fought back her natural reaction to deliver a scathing assessment of the other girl's powers of recollection. "That's the gist of it," she said instead, coolly. "But what do _you_ think?" She beseeched her with a probing look. "Thoughts? Feelings?" A blank face turned to evaluate her, its owner still hugging her knees. "Personal anecdotes?" Asuka added almost hopefully. _You gotta work with me, here, Ayanami. I'm really trying. But this is a two-way street._  
"好吧，她记忆力不错，这我早就知道。明日香抑制住自己本能的冲动，没有对另一个女孩的记忆能力做出尖刻的评价。“大致就是这样，”她冷冷地说，“但你怎么看？”她用探询的目光恳求着。“想法？感受？”一张空白的脸转向她，其主人依旧抱着膝盖。“个人轶事？”明日香几乎带着希望补充道。你得配合我，绫波。我真的在努力。但这需要双向沟通。”

Rei maintained her stare in Asuka's direction, though the girl could tell from the miniscule facial expression she was showing, which would have been indecipherable to her even days before, that her question was being seriously considered.  
绫波保持着对明日香的凝视，尽管女孩能从她微小的面部表情中看出，即便在几天前这些表情对她来说还难以解读，但她的提问正在被认真考虑。

Eventually, the tension broke with Rei's soft answer. "You were chosen to pilot Unit 01 for multiple reasons. The targeting computer that will guide the sniper in destroying the target could not be mounted onto Unit 00's systems due to existing feedback issues between the Eva and the Magi which remain unresolved. While I could pilot Unit 01 and fire the weapon, you were the more logical choice between the two of us considering your proven ability to synchronize with Unit 01.  
"最终，紧张的气氛随着丽温柔的回答而缓和。“你被选中驾驶 01 号机有多个原因。由于 EVA 与 MAGI 之间存在的反馈问题尚未解决，无法将引导狙击手摧毁目标的瞄准计算机安装到 00 号机的系统上。虽然我可以驾驶 01 号机并发射武器，但考虑到你与 01 号机同步能力的证明，你才是我们两人中更合理的选择。”

"This would suggest that Ikari-kun would be the optimal choice for the operation since his synch rate with Unit 01 is higher than yours." Asuka was about to interject but was cut off. "Captain Katsuragi, however, insisted that Ikari-kun needed time to recover before deploying in Unit 01 again. These conditions left Unit 00 free to deploy defensive measures in the event that the target strikes the firing position. Naturally, I would be its pilot, due to those same conditions leaving me an undesirable choice to pilot Unit 01. We will follow our orders, and the operation will be a success."  
"“这似乎表明，由于碇君与 01 号机的同步率比你高，他才是这次行动的最佳人选。”明日香正要插话，却被打断了。“葛城队长坚持认为，碇君需要时间恢复，才能再次驾驶 01 号机。这些条件使得 00 号机可以自由部署防御措施，以防目标攻击发射位置。自然，我会是它的驾驶员，因为同样的条件使我成为驾驶 01 号机的不佳选择。我们将遵循命令，行动必将成功。”

Asuka narrowed her eyes. _Tell me how you_ really _feel, Ayanami_, she thought without the sneer she wanted to give showing on her face. "Well, like you said, the logic checks out. But you didn't answer the question."  
明日香眯起了眼睛。告诉我你的真实感受，绫波，她心里想着，却没有让脸上露出她想给的嘲笑。“好吧，就像你说的，逻辑上是说得通的。但你没有回答问题。”

Rei kept her stare fixed on Asuka but raised an eyebrow slightly. "I explained my understanding of my orders."  
绫波保持目光紧盯着明日香，但微微挑起了一边的眉毛。“我已经解释了我对命令的理解。”

Asuka sighed. _Oh, come on! I already went through this with Shinji. Can't I get a break?_ "Sure, you told me how it's oh-so-logical that it's your job in this operation to be my meat shield in case that giant, floating, three-dimensional azure rhombus gets any funny ideas. But _what do you think_ about that?" She crossed her arms and frowned at Rei. "For instance, _I think_ that Misato is being overly optimistic that this rifle can kill the Angel in one shot—and that it won't at least take a potshot at me while I'm stuck there lining up the shot."  
明日香叹了口气。哦，拜托！我已经和真嗣讨论过这个了。难道我就不能休息一下吗？“当然，你告诉我，在这个行动中，作为我的肉盾以防那个巨大的、漂浮的、三维的蓝色菱形有什么奇怪的想法，这是多么合乎逻辑的你的职责。但你是怎么想的？”她交叉双臂，皱眉看着绫波。“比如说，我认为美里过于乐观地认为这把步枪能一击杀死使徒——而且在我被困在那里瞄准射击时，它不会至少对我开一枪。”

"If you are concerned for your safety, Second, do not be. I will protect you."  
"如果你担心自己的安全，二号，不必。我会保护你。"

Anger instantly flashed up into Asuka's chest, but she held her tongue and took a deep breath in an attempt to calm herself before speaking again. _I don't need—just shut up._ "Forget about what I think. You said you'd protect me. Interesting word choice. Not 'My orders are to block the attack,' or something like that. Is protection your interpretation of your part in this mission? Care to expand on that?"  
愤怒瞬间涌上明日香的心头，但她忍住了，深吸一口气试图平复情绪，再次开口。我不需要——闭嘴。“忘了我的想法吧。你说你会保护我。这个词选得有趣。不是‘我的命令是阻挡攻击’，或者其他类似的话。保护是你对自己在这项任务中角色的理解吗？愿意详细说说吗？”

Rei stared at the other girl for several moments, Asuka being unwilling to push any more for fear of losing her already tenuous grasp on civility in the conversation. _How hard is it to just tell me what you think?!_ "I am expendable. If I can take action to fulfill my orders then my life is irrelevant."  
绫波盯着另一个女孩，明日香不愿再逼问，生怕失去这场对话中本就脆弱的礼貌。告诉我你的想法有那么难吗？！“我是可牺牲的。如果我能采取行动完成命令，那么我的生命就无关紧要。”

"Bullshit!" Asuka roared, composure broken, as she stomped one foot angrily onto the metal platform with a _clang_. "You told me you weren't just some doll!" She was no longer filtering her thoughts before firing them off at the other pilot. "And now you're saying that your life doesn't matter?! That you're being ordered to throw yourself in front of this Angel's attack, and you don't even care?!"  
"胡说八道！" 明日香咆哮道，镇定自若已荡然无存，她愤怒地一脚跺在金属平台上，发出铿锵声。"你告诉我你不仅仅是个人偶！" 她不再在向另一位驾驶员发泄想法前过滤它们。"现在你却说你的生命无关紧要？！你被命令去挡在这使徒的攻击前，你甚至不在乎吗？！"

Rei calmly observed the outburst happening across from her.  
绫波冷静地观察着对面爆发的场面。

"Following orders is one thing, First. Hell, I get it! If your back's to the wall and you've got no other option, then fight to the death! Take as many of those fuckers with you as you can!" _Nine white harpies circled overhead, glistening red tongues_— "But you don't just go off and _die_ just because someone ordered you to! Piloting is dangerous, sure. We might die every time we get into an Eva. But it's a _choice._ I m—you make your _own_ decisions, Ayanami, including whether or not to follow stupid orders that will get you killed."  
"服从命令是一回事，一式。见鬼，我懂了！如果你的后路被堵死，别无选择，那就拼死一战！尽可能多地带走那些混蛋！" 九只白色哈比在头顶盘旋，闪烁着红色的舌头—— "但你不能仅仅因为有人命令你就去死！驾驶确实危险，当然。我们每次进入 Eva 都可能丧命。但这是选择。我——你做出自己的决定，绫波，包括是否服从那些会让你丧命的愚蠢命令。"

Rei turned away from Asuka, toward Unit 00, and smoothly stood from her seated position. "It is time to move into position."  
丽转身离开明日香，面向零号机，流畅地从坐姿站起。“是时候进入位置了。”

"Fine," Asuka said with a _huff_. With her rage still burning, she stomped over to the ladder at Unit 01's side that led to the entry plug, ascending with prejudice. _We're not finished, Ayanami. I don't care if you have no regard for your own life, but I_ will _make you at least act like you don't want to die. NERV doesn't get to treat me—treat us like that. Not this time._  
“好吧，”明日香气呼呼地说。怒火中烧的她，带着怨气走向初号机旁的梯子，通往插入栓，带着怨气攀爬上去。我们还没完，绫波。我不在乎你是否不在乎自己的生命，但我会让你至少表现得不想死。NERV 不能这样对待我——对待我们。这次不行。

Seated in the entry plug, she felt the familiar surge of motion that signaled the plug being twisted into place and gripped the control yokes tightly. LCL flooded the plug and Asuka took in the first lungful as smoothly as air. _Focus on the task at hand._ The material of her plugsuit _creak_ed around her clenched hands as Lieutenant Ibuki began talking through the pre-activation sequence. _Kill the Angel, cheer up the Idiot, then get back to securing Ayanami a place in the Geofront._  
坐在插入栓内，她感受到熟悉的运动感，标志着插入栓被旋入到位，她紧紧握住控制杆。LCL 充满插入栓，明日香如呼吸空气般顺畅地吸入第一口。专注于眼前的任务。她的驾驶服在她紧握的双手周围发出_吱嘎_声，随着伊吹摩耶中尉开始预启动序列的讲解。消灭使徒，让那个白痴振作起来，然后回去确保绫波在前线有个位置。

"Commencing activation. Asuka?" The normal group of technicians were operating out of a mobile command center, the projected video of the woman showing her crammed into the relatively small space with her and her coworkers seated almost on top of each other, Misato and Doctor Akagi standing behind them.  
"开始激活。明日香？" 一群常规的技术人员正在移动指挥中心内操作，投影视频中的女子显示她挤在相对狭小的空间里，她和同事们几乎坐在彼此的上方，葛城美里和赤木博士站在他们身后。

"Right," Asuka replied, slowly circulating the LCL in and out of her lungs to center herself. She plastered on her normal victorious smirk and closed her eyes. _Once more unto the breach, Unit 01_, she mentally articulated to the standoffish resident she seemed to share a tenuous alliance with. _One more fight together, then I get my Unit 02 back and you're stuck with Shinji. If all goes according to plan—which it will._  
"好的，" 明日香回答道，缓缓地将 LCL 吸入和呼出肺部以使自己集中精神。她贴上平时胜利的微笑，闭上了眼睛。再一次进入战斗，二号机，她在心中对那位似乎与她有着脆弱联盟关系的冷漠住民说道。再一起战斗一次，然后我就能拿回我的二号机，而你只能和真嗣在一起。如果一切按计划进行——一定会的。

Unit 01's inhabitant responded to her outreach much as it always did, although with less cajoling than Asuka had been expecting based off of previous experience. A feeling of begrudging acceptance, and what to Asuka felt like a familiar desire to mete out revenge, surged from the Eva, and once again the pilot felt the slightly disconcerting sense of being allowed to tag along. _Like giving a kid a controller that isn't plugged in, so they won't bother whoever's playing the game. Not that I have any experience with that._ Asuka banished the thoughts of whiling away her limited free time in university playing video games alone due to her lack of any real friends. _We'll put up with each other to kill the Angels, right, Unit 01?_  
初号机的内部生命体对她的示好反应一如往常，尽管比起阿斯卡基于过往经验预期的要少些哄劝。一种勉强接受的感觉，以及对明日香来说似曾相识的复仇欲望，从 Eva 中涌出，又一次，驾驶员感受到了那种略显不安的被允许随行的感觉。就像给一个孩子一个未插电的控制器，这样他们就不会打扰正在玩游戏的人。并非我有此经历。明日香驱散了那些因缺乏真正朋友而在大学有限自由时间里独自玩电子游戏的念头。我们会互相忍耐以消灭使徒，对吧，初号机？

Unsurprisingly, she received no vocal answer from the Eva, but did get a feeling of agreement, tinged with another sentiment she could not identify. _Good._ "Eva Unit 01 activated. Release the locks on the positron rifle." Asuka guided Unit 01 to step out of the scaffolding built in front of it and turned to the massive weapon held in place on an even more massive flatbed trailer nearby.  
不出所料，她没有从 Eva 那里得到口头回应，但确实感受到了一种同意的情绪，还夹杂着另一种她无法辨认的情感。很好。“Eva 初号机启动。解除阳电子炮锁定。”明日香引导初号机走出搭建在其前的脚手架，转向附近一个更大平板拖车上固定着的巨型武器。

"Locks released, positron rifle ready for transport to the firing position," Maya informed her.  
“锁已解除，阳电子步枪准备运至发射位置。”玛雅向她报告。

Unit 01 grabbed the rifle with both hands, hefting it up and cradling it in its arms against its upper chest; even for the Eva, the weapon was too long to feasibly carry in a conventional manner like it would a pallet rifle. The barrel and stock spread on either side of the Eva, just below the height of its shoulders, looming far over trees as Unit 01 followed Unit 00, carrying its own jerry-rigged burden, over the mountain.  
初号机双手抓起步枪，将其举起并抱在胸前；即便是对 EVA 来说，这武器也太长了，无法像搬运托盘步枪那样常规携带。枪管和枪托分别位于 EVA 肩膀下方，远远高出树梢，初号机跟随零号机，背负着临时改装的负担，翻越山岭。

The hike led the pair to the designated firing point, where Asuka directed Unit 01 to set down the rifle in its waiting cradle and Rei moved into position to await her possible involvement. "Positron rifle emplaced," Asuka announced as she instructed Unit 01 to position itself prone behind the weapon. Once properly positioned, she toggled the targeting visor to lower over her face from its stowed position sunken into the top of her seat, peering at the Angel perched above the city. _Prepare to get fucked, Angel. No one hurts Shinji—any of the pilots on my watch._ She felt, for what she reckoned to be the first time, Unit 01 mirror her resolve.  
两人徒步来到指定射击点，阿斯卡指挥初号机将步枪放置在等待的支架上，而绫波则移动到位置，准备可能的参与。“阳电子步枪已就位，”阿斯卡宣布，并指示初号机趴在武器后方。一旦位置正确，她切换了瞄准护目镜，从座位顶部下沉的存放位置降下，凝视着栖息在城市上方的使徒。准备受死吧，使徒。没人能伤害真嗣——我守护下的任何一位驾驶员。她感觉到，这或许是第一次，初号机映射出她的决心。

"Beginning coupling now—connections secured," Maya answered. "Ma'am?"  
“现在开始连接——已确认固定，”玛雅回答道。“女士？”

"All right. It's almost go-time. Asuka, Rei, you ready?" Misato was gripping the back of Maya's chair with one hand and had her brows turned down in determination.  
“好的。差不多要开始了。明日香，丽，准备好了吗？”美里一手紧握着玛雅椅背，眉头紧锁，神情坚定。

"Yes," Rei answered promptly.  
“是，”丽迅速回应。

"Let's do this!" Asuka declared triumphantly. The anticipation for the fight had built with every step of the trek up and then back partway down the other side of the mountain, and at least one of the pilots was beginning to feel the old excitement set in. It swept away thoughts of dolls, self-worth, living quarters, morose idiots, and other petty details, supplanting them with the comfortable sense of purpose and fulfilment that only piloting an Eva into combat could bring.  
"我们开始吧！" 明日香得意地宣布。随着一步步攀上山峰又折返至另一侧，对战斗的期待逐渐升温，至少有一位驾驶员开始感受到久违的兴奋。这股兴奋冲散了对玩偶、自我价值、居住环境、忧郁的傻瓜以及其他琐碎细节的思绪，取而代之的是唯有驾驶 Eva 投入战斗才能带来的那种充实感和使命感。

"That's what I like to hear." Misato matched Asuka's enthusiasm, a confident grin spreading on her face. "Begin charging on my mark. Asuka, you fire as soon as you can. Rei, standby. Release final safety systems! Begin diversionary bombardments!"  
"我就喜欢听这个。" 美里与明日香的热情相呼应，脸上绽开自信的笑容。"在我标记下开始充能。明日香，你一有机会就开火。绫波，待命。解除最终安全系统！开始佯攻轰炸！"

Asuka guided Unit 01 to pull the bolt of the rifle back and chamber a round while a chorus of technicians echoed the commands. A _thrum_ vibrated through the air as the banks of capacitors began to charge the rifle. Asuka tuned out the sound of the crew commenting on the status of the charging, focusing on the indicators inside the visor as they homed in on the Angel.  
明日香指挥零一机拉开步枪的枪栓并装填子弹，技术人员们齐声复述着指令。随着电容器组开始为步枪充电，空气中传来一阵低沉的震动。明日香屏蔽了工作人员对充电状态的评论声，专注于面罩内锁定天使的指示器。

Just seconds away from squeezing the trigger, Asuka heard the not unexpected cry of "High energy readings detected from the target!" break through the final countdown before firing. _Told you so._  
就在扣动扳机的最后一刻，明日香听到了那句意料之中的呼喊：“检测到目标高能量读数！”打破了发射前的最后倒计时。早就告诉你了。

"Fire!" Misato ordered, just as the reticle in Asuka's vision lined up and the rifle finished charging. Unit 01 fired the rifle just as the Angel launched its own attack, and Asuka watched in grim fascination as the rifle's positron beam and the Angel's particle beam approached one another. Instead of meeting, however, the two beams warped around each other in a spiral and continued off course past each other. The positron beam impacted the Angel off target, eliciting a high-pitched, tonal scream that throbbed within Asuka's skull but failed to even mark the target, while the particle beam grazed over Unit 01's position and impacted the mountain behind it.  
“开火！”美里命令道，与此同时，明日香视野中的瞄准线对齐，步枪也完成了充能。零一号机发射了步枪，而使徒也同时发起了攻击，明日香带着严峻的好奇心注视着步枪的正电子束和使徒的粒子束相互逼近。然而，两束光线并未相撞，而是扭曲成螺旋状绕过对方，继续偏离轨道。正电子束偏离目标击中了使徒，引发了一阵高亢的音调尖叫，震动着明日香的颅骨，却未能给目标留下任何痕迹，而粒子束则擦过零一号机的位置，击中了其背后的山体。

The shockwave from the impact rocked Asuka inside the entry plug, and even through her lower synch she could feel the muscles in Unit 01's arms strain against the force needed to hold the rifle steady.  
撞击产生的冲击波在插入栓内摇撼着明日香，即便同步率较低，她也能感受到零一号机手臂上的肌肉因保持步枪稳定所需的力道而紧绷。

"The enemy has broken into the Geofront!" Asuka hesitantly identified Hyuga as having broadcast the alert.  
"敌人已经突破到 Geofront 了！" 明日香犹豫地确认是日向发出的警报。

"Reload, hurry!" Misato loudly urged.

With the aftereffects of the blast dissipated, Asuka had Unit 01 cycle the bolt of the rifle to chamber a new round while technicians announced the recharging status and barrel temperatures. _That's a dirty trick. And a pretty strong blast, too. You took that straight to the chest?_ Unit 01 surged an affirmative sensation in response, but Asuka had little time to ponder on it. Another energy reading was building up within the Angel, and Asuka was now evaluating how long it would take to fire again. _No good. It'll fire way before I can._ A seed of worry sprouted in Asuka's mind as she considered what her fellow pilot was likely about to do.  
爆炸的余波消散后，明日香让零号机循环步枪的枪栓以装填新弹药，同时技术人员宣布了充电状态和枪管温度。这招真脏。而且爆炸力也很强。你直接承受了胸口的冲击？零号机涌出一股肯定的感觉作为回应，但明日香没有太多时间去深思。天使体内的能量正在积聚，明日香现在正在评估再次开火需要多长时间。不行。它会在我之前开火。明日香心中萌生了一丝担忧，她考虑着她的同伴飞行员可能即将要做的事情。

"Ayanami!" She yelled, putting her plan into words as quickly as she could think. "Our AT fields, together! We'll reinforce the shield while the rifle is charging!"  
"绫波！" 她大喊道，尽可能快地将她的计划付诸言语。"我们的 AT 力场，一起！我们会在步枪充电时加强护盾！"

"Yes," Rei answered, calm despite the constrained chaos of the battle.  
“是的，”丽回答道，尽管战场上混乱不堪，她的语气依旧平静。

"It won't buy you much, but it'll have to do—the Angel is firing!" Doctor Akagi forcefully cautioned the pilots.  
“这不会给你带来太多优势，但眼下只能如此——使徒正在开火！”赤木博士坚定地提醒着驾驶员们。

Asuka's vision whited out as the Angel fired directly toward her, her own weapon still charging. The blast was cut short, however, as Unit 00 interposed itself between Unit 01 and the Angel. Blinding light scattered over the sides of the shield the interloper was holding in front of itself, revealing the ephemeral orange octagonal pattern of Unit 00's AT field manifested around the shield, absorbing the heat and energy the shield struggled to hold back.  
当使徒直接向她射击时，明日香的视野一片空白，她的武器仍在充能中。然而，爆炸被截断了，因为零号机介入了初号机和使徒之间。刺眼的光芒从零号机举起的盾牌两侧散射开来，盾牌上显现出零号机 AT 力场形成的短暂橙色八角形图案，环绕着盾牌，吸收了盾牌努力抵御的热量和能量。

Asuka willed Unit 01 to raise its own AT field—not to erode, as she would when fighting against an Angel's, but to bolster. Even with the added support, she could see Unit 00 battling to keep the shield raised, smoke rising from its armor as their combined strength still failed to hold back the full assault of the Angel. Already she could hear over the comm channel that the shield was failing. _Even two AT fields won't be enough to stop that beam. Once the shield's gone, we're done. Come on, come on!_  
明日香竭力让 01 号机提升自身的 AT 力场——不是像对抗使徒时那样削弱，而是增强。即便有了额外的支援，她仍能看到 00 号机在竭力维持护盾，烟雾从装甲上升起，他们联合的力量依旧无法完全抵挡使徒的猛攻。通过通讯频道，她已经能听到护盾即将崩溃的声音。即便两个 AT 力场也不足以阻挡那道光束。一旦护盾消失，我们就完了。快点，快点！

Finally, after what Asuka estimated to be approximately three eternities, with the Angel keeping up its attack the entire time, her targeting visor indicated the rifle was charged, and Misato called "Fire!"  
终于，在明日香估计大约经历了三个永恒之后，使徒持续攻击的整个过程中，她的瞄准镜显示步枪已充电完毕，美里喊道：“开火！”

Unit 01 once again squeezed the trigger, just as both Evas dropped their AT fields. The positron beam, this time having been aimed to account for the effect of the Angel's particle beam, shot straight and true to its target. It impacted dead center on the Angel, piercing through its AT field, through its reflective blue surface. The Angel's attack suddenly stopped, and it screamed anew, this time emitting a longer, keening wail that decrescendoed into a pitiful, though still earsplitting, mewl, followed by a shattering sound as the Angel sunk to the ground. A cheer erupted over the comm channel.  
初号机再次扣动扳机，就在两台 EVA 同时解除 AT 力场的瞬间。这次，阳电子炮经过调整，考虑到了使徒粒子束的影响，直射向目标，准确无误。它正中使徒中心，穿透其 AT 力场，贯穿其反射着蓝光的表面。使徒的攻击戛然而止，它再次尖叫，这次发出的是更长、更尖锐的哀鸣，逐渐减弱成可怜但仍震耳欲聋的呜咽，随后是破碎声，使徒倒地。通讯频道中爆发出欢呼声。

What Asuka was focused on, however, was Unit 00 collapsed over the melted remains of its ersatz shield. Its armor was smoking, even melting in some places. She angrily swiped the targeting visor over her head, causing it to fold back into its stowage position, and opened a video feed to Unit 00's entry plug.  
然而，明日香的关注点是零号机倒在那熔化的临时盾牌残骸上。其装甲冒着烟，甚至在某些地方开始熔化。她愤怒地甩开头上的瞄准镜，使其折叠回存放位置，并打开与零号机插入栓的视频连接。

"Ayanami!" She barked as the video link sluggishly connected.  
“绫波！”她厉声喝道，视频链接缓慢接通。

"Soryu," Rei answered as her visage popped into Asuka's sight. Her posture was not her normal attentive position: her head and shoulders drooped, and she only loosely held her controls. "You are uninjured."  
"惣流，" 丽回答道，她的面容出现在明日香的视线中。她的姿态并非平时的专注状态：头和肩膀下垂，只是松散地握着控制器。"你没有受伤。"

"What are you, stupid? Worry about yourself, First!" Asuka berated her. _Of course I'm uninjured, you were the human shield, not me!_  
"你是不是傻？先关心你自己吧，第一！" 明日香责备她。当然我没受伤，你才是人肉盾牌，不是我！"

"I am fatigued, though also uninjured," Rei reported to the irate pilot. "As I said, we followed our orders, and the mission was a success." Asuka growled but Rei continued before she could put her fury into words. "Your recommendation to support the makeshift Eva Anti-Heat and Light Wave Defensive Equipment with our combined AT fields was sound. I decided to follow it."  
"虽然我也未受伤，但感到疲惫，" 丽向愤怒的驾驶员报告。"正如我所说，我们遵循了命令，任务取得了成功。" 明日香咆哮着，但丽在她能将怒火化为言语之前继续说道。"你建议用我们联合的 AT 力场来支持临时 EVA 抗热和光波防御装备是明智的。我决定采纳这个建议。"

Asuka felt most of her anger evaporate in a rush, coupled with the feeling of Unit 01 expressing curiosity towards her—again. She ignored it. _Was that a peace offering? Am I making progress?_ "You're damn right it was a good idea!" Asuka boasted.  
明日香感到大部分怒气瞬间消散，同时感受到初号机对她表现出的好奇——又一次。她置之不理。这是和解的表示吗？我是不是有所进展？“你说的没错，这主意太棒了！”明日香自夸道。

"Yeah, great job, you two!" Misato exclaimed. "Let's get you out of here. Don't worry about a debrief tonight, you girls just get yourselves sorted. You both deserve a break."  
“是啊，干得漂亮，你们俩！”美里赞叹道，“我们赶紧离开这里吧。今晚不用汇报了，你们俩先好好休息。你们都值得好好放松一下。”

Ω

Asuka rose from a bench and shut her locker door, relishing the feeling of being freshly showered and wearing something besides a plugsuit for the first time in what felt like months—even if it was the beige NERV uniform she had taken to wearing around the Geofront the past few weeks. While she had found that the female top did little to flatter her figure, especially in comparison to the tight black dress or sleeveless blue blouse a select few of her coworkers wore, she had decided to stick with it.  
明日香从长椅上起身，关上储物柜门，享受着刚洗完澡、穿上除了插入栓服以外的衣服的感觉，仿佛已经过去了几个月——尽管她最近几周在 Geofront 一直穿着那件米色的 NERV 制服。虽然她发现女式上衣对她的身材并不怎么修饰，尤其是与少数同事所穿的紧身黑裙或无袖蓝衬衫相比，但她还是决定继续穿这件。

She had, however, long since swapped out the skirt that was standard for the female uniform in favor of the male pants, having found the skirt lacking in utility even if it did give her the opportunity to flaunt what were, of course, her perfectly toned legs. She stretched her arms over her head and closed her eyes, willing the tension in her muscles to drain away. With limited success.  
然而，她早已换掉了女式制服标配的裙子，改穿男式的裤子，因为她觉得那裙子实用性不足，尽管它确实给了她展示自己那双完美健美双腿的机会。她伸了个懒腰，闭上眼睛，试图让肌肉中的紧张感消散。效果有限。

While she was taking this brief moment to herself, the First Child entered the locker room. Asuka opened one eye to a slit and watched her make her way to her own locker. The other girl's hair was still damp with LCL, and her body language did not betray a hint of the fatigue or pain Asuka was sure she was still feeling.  
正当她享受这片刻独处时光时，第一适格者走进了更衣室。明日香微微睁开一只眼，看着她走向自己的储物柜。那女孩的头发仍带着 LCL 的湿润，而她的肢体语言丝毫没有透露出疲惫或疼痛的迹象，尽管明日香确信她仍在承受这些。

_She's—tenacious_, Asuka begrudgingly allowed, forgoing the criticism that came more naturally to her. She turned to face the other pilot's back with her full attention, dropping her arms and crossing them over her chest. Rei was meticulously removing her plugsuit, carefully stripping it away from her body, with no conceit to modesty. _I guess she's sort of pretty. In a weird way. Not as tall as me, though. What does she—_ Asuka forcibly halted that line of thought and elected to ignore what were certainly not feelings of jealousy and envy. Again, she was not as successful as she would have necessarily wanted to be.  
她——坚韧不拔，明日香不情愿地承认，放弃了那些更自然的批评。她转过身，全神贯注地面对着另一位驾驶员的背影，放下双臂交叉在胸前。绫波正在一丝不苟地脱下插入栓服，小心翼翼地从身体上剥离，丝毫不顾及 modesty。我想她也算得上漂亮。有点奇怪的那种。不过没我高。她在想什么——明日香强行打断了这种思绪，决定忽略那些肯定不是嫉妒和羡慕的情绪。再次，她并没有像自己希望的那样成功。

Instead, she focused on her earlier failure. _You took your sweet time checking on the Third. You can't let that become a habit, Soryu. You need to focus on what matters, and stop getting distracted._ She closed her eyes while taking a deep breath, held it for a moment, then released it slowly, opening her eyes once again—pointedly not comparing the First's rear anatomy to her own. "How are you feeling, Ayanami?"  
相反，她专注于之前的失败。你花了太多时间去关心第三适格者。你不能让这成为习惯，Soryu。你需要专注于重要的事情，不要再分心。她闭上眼睛深吸一口气，保持片刻，然后缓缓呼出，再次睁开眼睛——特意不去比较第一适格者的臀部与自己的。“绫波，你感觉怎么样？”

Rei paused with her plugsuit fully removed and discarded in a heap on the ground beside her, one hand reaching into her locker for a towel. "I am well. A brief medical exam confirmed my lack of physical injury." She grabbed her towel and draped it around her neck but made no move towards the showers.  
丽在脱下驾驶服后，将其随意丢弃在一旁的地面上，一只手伸进储物柜中寻找毛巾。“我很好。一次简短的体检确认了我身体无恙。”她拿起毛巾，围在脖子上，却没有走向淋浴间。

_And that's all, First? Not even a—  
就这样，队长？连一句——_

"I am unsure what to do in situations like this. You helped to protect me, even though it was my responsibility to shield you. You have also demonstrated concern for my wellbeing in other ways. Previously, Ikari-kun has suggested that I express thanks when someone helps me. Is that acceptable now?"  
“我不确定在这种情况下该怎么做。你帮助保护了我，尽管本应由我来保护你。你也以其他方式表达了对我的关心。之前，碇君曾建议我在别人帮助我时表示感谢。现在这样做合适吗？”

Asuka blinked; her private tirade was headed off. _Weirder and weirder. Though maybe I'm getting used to you, Ayanami._ "For once, the Idiot is right," Asuka said with a flippant wave of her hand, though the other girl did not see it. _Just what exactly have you two been talking about? The Third certainly isn't qualified to lecture anyone on this kind of stuff. I suppose I'll have to add Remedial Social Skills to Eva Academy's curriculum. One more thing Professor Soryu is the expert in._  
"明日香眨了眨眼；她的私人牢骚被打断了。越来越奇怪了。不过也许我已经习惯了你，绫波。“这一次，那个白痴倒是说对了，”明日香带着轻蔑的手势说道，尽管另一个女孩并没有看到。你们俩到底在谈些什么？第三适格者可没资格在这方面教训任何人。我想我得在 EVA 学院的课程中加上社交技能补习。再多一项，Soryu 教授是专家。”

The blue haired pilot turned to Asuka, who resisted the urge to cast a judgmental glance down her body and met her eyes instead. "Then I thank you for your concern, and for your help, Soryu. Would it also be appropriate to inquire after your own health in response?"  
蓝发驾驶员转向明日香，后者忍住了向下打量她身体的评判目光，而是直接对上了她的眼睛。“那么，我感谢你的关心，以及你的帮助，Soryu。询问你的健康状况作为回应是否也合适？”

"You're welcome, I guess. And yes, that would be _appropriate_," Asuka offered with a raised eyebrow and a mildly curious tone.  
“不用谢，我想。是的，那样问是合适的，”明日香挑了挑眉，带着些许好奇的语气回答道。

Rei nodded succinctly. "Are you also still doing well?"  
丽简洁地点了点头。“你也还好吗？”

Asuka _hmph_ed and turned her nose up imperiously. "I'm just great, First," she quipped, but almost immediately regretted it. _Stop falling into old habits!_ "I mean, yeah, I'm fine," she said quickly, returning her gaze to Rei and schooling her features. _Great, now you sound like a stupid, indecisive little girl. Just perfect, Soryu. You need to be better than this._ "You were the one who took the heat, after all. Literally," she added.  
明日香哼了一声，傲慢地扬起鼻子。“我好得很，第一，”她打趣道，但几乎立刻就后悔了。别再陷入旧习惯了！“我是说，嗯，我很好，”她迅速说道，目光回到丽身上，努力控制表情。天哪，现在你听起来像个优柔寡断的小女孩。真是完美，惣流。你得做得更好。“毕竟，是你承受了那股热量，”她补充道。

"I am glad you are uninjured. It is important for the pilots to be able to fulfill their function."  
“很高兴你没受伤。飞行员能履行职责很重要。”

Anger surged in Asuka's chest as Rei turned to walk toward the showers, but she once again closed her eyes and took a deep breath to steady herself. _Baby steps with this one. You've started off with something good, don't ruin it now. Just move on._ "Do you know where you're staying tonight?" She asked flatly, her simmering ire just perceptible in her voice.  
愤怒在明日香胸中翻涌，当丽转身走向淋浴间时，她再次闭上眼睛，深吸一口气以平复心情。对这个女孩要循序渐进。你已经开了个好头，别现在搞砸了。继续前进。“你知道今晚住哪儿吗？”她平淡地问道，声音中隐约透出一丝未消的怒气。

Rei stopped but did not turn back. "Captain Katsuragi called to inform me that I am to return to her apartment tonight with Ikari-kun, and that we should not wait for her to make our way there."  
丽停下脚步，但没有回头。“葛城队长打电话通知我，今晚我要和真嗣君一起回她的公寓，我们不必等她，直接过去。”

"Good," Asuka replied, releasing the breath she had not realized she had been holding. What little tension she had managed to relieve earlier had already built back up. "I'm going to see the Third now."  
“好，”明日香回答，松开了她未曾意识到一直屏住的呼吸。之前好不容易缓解的那点紧张感，已经重新积聚起来。“我现在要去见第三适格者。”

"Well, that's good for you," Rei answered, entering the showers.  
“嗯，那对你挺好的，”丽回答道，走进了淋浴间。

Asuka turned with a _huff_ and exited the locker room. _What the hell is that supposed to—just move on. Right._  
明日香哼了一声，转身离开了更衣室。那是什么意思——就当没事发生？对。

Ω

Asuka pushed open the door leading into the Third Child's hospital room, her earlier hesitation at the entryway absent. They boy was standing with his back to the door and pulling a dark blue t-shirt over his head, his black pants already cinched around his waist. Asuka caught a glimpse of bandages wrapped around his torso before the shirt covered him. _The bottle blonde's influence, no doubt._ She stepped over to the chair beside the boy's bed as he greeted her with a blush, a bashful smile, and a quiet "Hi, Asuka," after he had hurriedly threaded his head through the shirt and turned to recognize her. She lowered herself gracefully into the open seat next to the bed.  
明日香推开第三适格者病房门，之前的犹豫已不复存在。男孩背对着门，正将一件深蓝色 T 恤套过头，黑色裤子已经系在腰间。明日香瞥见他缠满绷带的躯干，随即被 T 恤遮住。毫无疑问，这是金发女孩的影响。她走到男孩床边的椅子旁，他匆匆将头穿过 T 恤，转过身来，脸颊微红，羞涩地笑着，轻声打招呼：“嗨，明日香。”她优雅地坐进床边的空椅子。

"Before you ask, everyone's fine—just like I told you we would be," Asuka announced by way of greeting. She watched as Shinji donned his customary white school uniform shirt, not noticing any peculiarities to his movement that would bely any pain_._ "Unit 00 suffered some damage, which I'll probably be stuck working on, on top of the headaches the prototype already gives me, but Ayanami isn't hurt. I saw her in the locker room earlier, she's going with you back to Misato's tonight."  
"在你问之前，大家都没事——就像我告诉你的那样，" 明日香以这种方式打招呼。她看着真嗣穿上他惯常的白色校服衬衫，没有注意到他的动作有任何异常，似乎并不痛苦。"零号机受了些损伤，我可能得被这麻烦事缠上，再加上那原型机本来就让我头疼，但绫波没事。我之前在更衣室看到她了，她今晚和你一起回美里小姐那儿。"

"That's great!" Shinji exclaimed while he finished buttoning his shirt. "Um, not that you'll have to fix Unit 00, but—"  
"那太好了！" 真嗣边扣衬衫扣子边喊道。"呃，不是说你得修理零号机不好，但是——"

"Yeah, I got it," Asuka blustered. "Now—"  
"嗯，我明白，" 明日香急忙打断。"现在——"

"No, really," Shinji interjected. He stopped smoothing out his shirt with his hands and sat down on the bed he would not be occupying that night, then deliberately faced Asuka. "I'm glad everyone is ok. Thanks for telling me, Asuka. I know you didn't have to do that." His confidence apparently used up, he diverted his gaze to his hands folded in his lap.  
"不，真的，" 真嗣插话道。他停下了用手抚平衬衫的动作，坐在那晚不会睡的床上，然后故意面对着明日香。"我很高兴大家都没事。谢谢你告诉我，明日香。我知道你本不必这么做。" 他的自信显然已经耗尽，于是将目光转向了叠放在膝上的双手。

Asuka's heart once again lurched in her chest, but she ignored it. _Interrupt_ me_, Third?!_ "I—"  
明日香的心再次在胸中猛跳，但她忽略了这种感觉。_打断我，第三适格者？！_ "我——"

"I hated being down here while everyone else was fighting. I felt so useless."  
"我在下面看着大家战斗，感觉自己真是没用极了。"

Asuka's brow furrowed. _Not this again. Come on, Idiot, we already talked about this!_ "That's—"  
明日香皱起了眉头。又来了。拜托，笨蛋，我们不是已经讨论过这个了吗！“那是——”

"But then I started thinking about what you said to me after the last Angel," Shinji pressed on. "Down at the pool?" He looked up to her again, and Asuka raised her eyebrow and nodded. "Well, then Kaji-san came by to give me my stuff. We, umm, talked. For a little while. I guess what I'm saying is I think I'm starting to figure out what piloting means for me." He offered a shaky smile to Asuka, who closed her eyes and sighed quietly to herself.  
“但后来我开始思考你上次使徒之后对我说的话，”真嗣继续说道，“在泳池边？”他再次抬头看向她，明日香扬起眉毛点了点头。“嗯，然后加持先生过来把我的东西给了我。我们，呃，聊了一会儿。我想说的是，我开始明白驾驶对我意味着什么了。”他向明日香露出一个颤抖的微笑，她闭上眼睛，轻声叹了口气。

_Good. Now just stick with it, Third._ "That's good for you," she told him airily, despite her throat feeling tight, waving her hand noncommittally. _That's it?! That's all you can say?! You're worse than he is. No wonder Kaji pays more attention to him than to you._  
“好。那就坚持下去，三号。”她轻描淡写地对他说，尽管喉咙发紧，还是随意地挥了挥手。就这样？！你就只能说这些？！你比他还糟糕。难怪加持更关注他而不是你。

Shinji's shoulders loosened and he let out a deep breath, his eyes returning to his lap. "Sorry to keep bothering you with my problems," he mumbled.  
真嗣的肩膀松弛下来，他深吸了一口气，目光回到了自己的膝盖上。“抱歉总是用我的问题打扰你，”他咕哝道。

"Stop ap—" Asuka cut herself off, the sharp retort dying as quickly as it had manifested. "It's fine, Third," she said with a _huff_ as she stood from her seat. _Great. Scare him off, Soryu. That's perfect._ "Ayanami will be down any minute. Are you done packing?"  
“别再——”明日香突然打住，那尖锐的反驳如出现时一样迅速消散。“没事的，三号，”她带着一丝不悦从座位上站起来。太好了。吓跑他，惣流。简直完美。“绫波马上就下来了。你收拾好了吗？”

He nodded, his gaze still downcast. They quickly snapped to the door, however, as it opened to reveal Rei: showered, dressed in her uniform, and carrying her school bag. She instantly locked eyes with Shinji.  
他点点头，目光依旧低垂。然而，当门打开，丽出现时，他们的目光立刻被吸引了过去：她已经洗过澡，穿着校服，背着书包。她立刻与真嗣的视线交汇。

"Are you ready to return to Captain Katsuragi's apartment, Ikari-kun?"  
"碇君，准备好回葛城美里小姐的公寓了吗？"

"Hi, Ayanami-san!" He said with some cheer. "Yeah, we can go now if you want." He stood up and grabbed his own bag from the floor beside the bed. "Kaji-san offered to drive us." His head turned to face Asuka, who was standing with her arms crossed watching the exchange, noting once again that Rei frowned slightly at the man's name. _Seriously, what's your deal with Kaji, First?_  
"嗨，绫波同学！" 他带着几分欢快说道，"嗯，如果你想的话，我们现在就可以走。" 他站起身，从床边的地板上抓起自己的包。"加持先生提出要开车送我们。" 他的头转向看着这一幕、双臂交叉的明日香，注意到绫波再次对那个男人的名字微微皱眉。说真的，你对加持到底有什么问题，第一？

"Did you want to come with us, Asuka?" He asked her, his voice more subdued. "It's pretty late—erm, early—but I was going to make something to eat. We have enough for you, too."  
"明日香，你要不要和我们一起来？" 他问她，声音更加低沉。"已经很晚了——呃，或者说很早——但我打算做点吃的。我们也有你的份。"

Asuka frowned, ignoring how her chest once again felt like it was constricting. "I'm busy, Third," she informed him with a haughty tone, not a trace of longing in it. "There's still paperwork to take care of."  
明日香皱起眉头，忽略了胸口再次紧缩的感觉。“我很忙，三号，”她用傲慢的语气告诉他，没有一丝渴望。“还有文件要处理。”

Shinji quickly looked down and turned back away from Asuka. "Ok," he said quietly.  
真嗣迅速低下头，再次转过身去。“好的，”他轻声说道。

As he walked towards Rei and the exit, bag in hand, the pale girl looked over to Asuka. "I will remain vigilant tonight, Soryu."  
当他走向绫波和出口，手里提着包时，苍白的女孩看向明日香。“今晚我会保持警惕，惣流。”

Asuka blinked owlishly. _Was—did she make a_ joke_?_ "Um, sure, Ayanami. Great."  
明日香眨了眨眼，一脸茫然。她——她是在开玩笑吗？“呃，当然，绫波。太好了。”

Shinji stopped midstride, looking between both girls. "What does that mean, Ayanami-san?"  
真嗣停下脚步，来回看着两位女孩。“那是什么意思，绫波同学？”

"Don't worry about it!" Asuka insisted, stomping over to Shinji and pushing him towards the door. Rei dutifully led the way into the hall, and Asuka slammed the door shut behind Shinji once he had walked off after her. She leaned against the door, put her head in her hands, and groaned. Out in the hall, she could hear the pair walking away while they made muffled conversation, then heard Shinji whine sharply "No, I _didn't_! I swear!"  
“别担心！”明日香坚持道，快步走向真嗣，推着他朝门口走去。绫波忠实地领着他们走进走廊，明日香在真嗣跟着她走出去后用力关上门。她靠在门上，双手抱头，呻吟了一声。在走廊外，她能听到两人边走边低声交谈，然后听到真嗣尖锐地抱怨：“不，我没有！我发誓！”

Ω

Asuka scrunched her eyes closed and stretched her arms towards the ceiling while she leaned back slightly in Misato's chair, inside her office. _Now I just need her to get here._ She had spent the last few hours working on her renewed proposal to move the First Child to quarters in the Geofront. She had not bothered with any alternative sites, figuring that any time spent justifying them would be a waste. Clearly the Commander would have to see reason and approve her request this time.  
明日香紧闭双眼，双臂伸向天花板，微微后仰坐在美里办公室的椅子上。现在只等她来了。她花了几个小时重新起草将第一适格者调至地底都市居住的提案。她没有考虑任何其他地点，认为为它们辩护纯属浪费时间。显然，司令这次必须看清形势，批准她的请求。

She dropped her elbows down onto the desk and rested her head in her hands while she anxiously tapped her foot. _Hurry up, Misato. This was supposed to be done yesterday._ Her stomach growled, and she _hmph_ed. _They get a good meal and beds, while I starve and wait for the drunk._  
她将手肘撑在桌上，双手托腮，焦急地用脚敲打着地面。快点，美里。这事儿昨天就该办妥了。她的肚子咕咕叫，她哼了一声。他们有美食和床铺，而我却饿着肚子等那个醉鬼。

Finally, much to Asuka's relief, the office door opened, and the prodigal captain entered. She scanned the room quickly once she saw the light on, one hand slipping into her jacket, but she smiled and dropped the hand back down when she saw who was sitting at her desk.  
终于，让明日香松了一口气的是，办公室的门开了，那位久违的队长走了进来。她一看到灯光便迅速扫视了一圈，一只手伸进外套，但当她看到坐在桌前的人时，便微笑着将手放了下来。

"Asuka! What are you doing here? It's nearly six, you should be asleep."  
"明日香！你在这里做什么？快六点了，你应该在睡觉。"

She shifted herself to support her head with one hand, using the other to tap the stack of papers sitting in front of her. "My part's done," she said.  
她用一只手撑起头，另一只手敲了敲面前的一叠文件。"我的部分完成了，"她说。

Misato shook her head, walking over to sit on her desk and face Asuka. She did not move to examine the papers. "Ayanami's transfer? That could've waited." _It's waited long enough, Misato. Am I the only one around here who has their priorities right?_ "I just stopped down here to pick up my keys. I'm heading home, and not coming in 'til late." She tapped her chin in thought. "Say, why don't you come with me? I'll bet Shinji made dinner. You can stay the night, too. I'll tell Rits you're taking the day off."  
美里摇了摇头，走过去坐在桌子上面对明日香。她没有去检查那些文件。"绫波的转学？这可以等。"已经等得够久了，美里。难道我是这里唯一一个有正确优先级的人吗？"我只是顺便下来拿钥匙。我要回家了，而且不会早来。"她若有所思地轻敲着下巴。"对了，你为什么不跟我一起走？我敢打赌真嗣做了晚饭。你也可以留宿一晚。我会告诉律子你请了一天假。"

_Yeah, I bet the Idiot will be really happy to have me around, interrupting—_ "I'm not hungry," Asuka told her as she stood up. "I'm going to bed. Remind the First and the Third that we've got training to catch up on today."  
是啊，我敢打赌那个白痴会很高兴有我在身边，打断——“我不饿，”明日香站起来对她说。“我要去睡觉了。提醒第一和第三适格者，我们今天有训练要补上。”

Misato sighed and watched Asuka walk towards the door. "If you're sure."  
美里叹了口气，看着明日香走向门口。“如果你确定的话。”

_Of course I am._ Asuka left, one last call from Misato following her out the door.  
我当然确定。明日香离开了，美里最后一声呼唤随着她出了门。

"It's ok to relax sometimes, Asuka."  
"有时候放松一下也没关系的，明日香。"

She paid it no mind, already focusing on her schedule for the rest of the day.  
她对此毫不在意，已经开始专注于当天剩余时间的安排。

### Chapter 10

Παλαιά καινοίς δακρύοις ου χρη στένειν. (Don't waste fresh tears over old sorrows) — Euripides  
旧愁莫以新泪挥。（不要为旧的悲伤浪费新的眼泪）——欧里庇得斯

"It would be simple enough to code and run," Doctor Akagi said after flipping through the notebook Asuka had handed her. The two of them were in the woman's claustrophobic office. The room was dominated by a desk with multiple monitors and keyboards, wires trailing off to connect to unseen devices, with most flat surfaces serving as home to several filled ashtrays, too many mugs of stale coffee to have been from just that day (considering it was only the early afternoon), and various cat figurines. The doctor raised a scrutinizing look to Asuka. "Two Angels, though? They've never attacked simultaneously before. We don't have reason to suspect that they will."  
"编码和运行起来应该很简单，"赤木律子博士在翻阅了明日香递给她的笔记本后说道。两人正身处博士那狭小得令人窒息的办公室里。房间中央是一张摆满多个显示器和键盘的桌子，电线蜿蜒连接着看不见的设备，而大多数平面上则摆放着几个满是烟蒂的烟灰缸，显然不止一天的量（考虑到那时才刚过午后），还有数不清的冷咖啡杯，以及各式各样的猫咪小雕像。博士抬起头，用审视的目光看向明日香。"两只使徒，虽然它们从未同时发起过攻击。我们没有理由怀疑它们会这么做。"

"I'm just trying to be thorough, Doctor," Asuka quickly covered. She was standing in front of the desk, arms folded across her chest, and met Akagi's look with one of her own.  
"我只是想做到万无一失，博士，"明日香迅速回应道。她站在桌前，双臂交叉抱在胸前，迎上了赤木博士的目光。

Akagi frowned slightly and returned her attention to Asuka's simulation parameters. "I see," she replied softly. "Well," she said, speaking up, "we're going to be busy effecting repairs on the Evas. This can wait." _No, it can't._ She closed the notebook, sliding it over the desk back to its owner, and turned to one of the monitors on her desk, fingers already busy on a keyboard. When Asuka did not take the dismissal, obstinately standing her ground, the doctor sighed quietly. "I'm familiar with your training schedule, Pilot. You don't have any simulation time booked in the next few days."  
赤木皱了皱眉，将注意力重新转回到明日香的模拟参数上。“我明白了，”她轻声回答，“好吧，”她提高了声音，“我们得忙着修复 EVA。这个可以等等。”不，不能等。她合上笔记本，将其滑回桌子的主人面前，转身面对桌上的一个显示器，手指已经在键盘上忙碌起来。当明日香没有接受这个打发，固执地站在原地时，医生轻轻叹了口气。“我对你的训练计划很熟悉，驾驶员。接下来的几天里你没有预约任何模拟训练时间。”

"I've decided to amend the schedule," Asuka said levelly, with some effort on her part. Her hand almost went to her pants pocket, but she stopped herself. _Wait for the right time. She'll know it's a bribe anyway, so make it count._  
“我决定调整计划，”明日香平静地说，尽管这需要她付出一些努力。她的手几乎要伸向裤袋，但还是停住了。等待合适的时机。她无论如何都会知道这是贿赂，所以得让它有价值。

"You were supposed to inform me of any changes," Akagi said shortly.  
“你本应通知我任何变动，”赤木简短地说道。

"I'm informing you now," the pilot replied. _Not yet._ Her voice contained none of the ire she felt.  
"我现在就告诉你，"飞行员回答道。还没。她的声音里没有流露出她感受到的愤怒。

Ritsuko stopped typing momentarily to heave an exasperated _huff_. "So it would seem. But there's no one with the proper Magi access to set this up that also has the time to do it." Her hand slipped into her lab coat, fumbling at an internal pocket, before coming out empty. "You _do_ recall the work that needs to be done on Unit 00?" She then pulled open a desk drawer and searched through it for her prey.  
律子暂时停下打字，发出了一声无奈的叹息。"看来是这样。但没有人既有合适的 MAGI 权限来设置这个，又有时间去做这件事。"她的手伸进白大褂，摸索着内袋，结果空手而出。"你还记得零号机需要完成的工作吗？"随后她拉开一个抽屉，在里面寻找她的目标。

_Chance!_ "Give me the access and I'll do it myself," Asuka said lightly. She reached into her pocket and pulled out a pack of cigarettes, coincidentally the same brand the doctor preferred, and smoothly placed it on the desk. She gave it a gentle tap with one finger for good measure.  
机会！"给我权限，我自己来做，"明日香轻松地说道。她伸手从口袋里掏出一包香烟，巧合的是，正是医生偏爱的品牌，然后熟练地放在桌上。她用一根手指轻轻敲了敲以示强调。

Akagi looked between the prize and the pilot, then chuckled with a shake of her head. "You've been spending too much time with Ryoji," she muttered_._ "All right, fine," she said, snatching up the pack. "I wasn't counting on your contribution today anyway, since Misato informed me you were taking the day off. I'll give you limited access, and you can get this taken care of yourself. You'll want the simulator plugs set up for this evening?"  
赤木在奖品和驾驶员之间来回看了看，然后摇头轻笑。“你和源堂待太久了，”她低声嘀咕。“好吧，行，”她说着，一把抓起那包东西。“反正我也没指望你今天能帮忙，毕竟美里告诉我你请假了。我会给你有限制的权限，你自己处理这事。你今晚需要模拟器插头吗？”

"Yes, Doctor," Asuka affirmed sweetly, her best smile showing. _Too easy. Of course, the Great Asuka Langley Soryu would be an expert in this, as well._  
“是的，博士，”明日香甜甜地确认道，露出她最迷人的微笑。太简单了。当然，伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷在这方面可是专家。

"Fine," Akagi said, lighting her payoff and looking back to her work. Asuka took the cue and left her office. As she was leaving, she heard the doctor's phone ringing and the woman answering it with a "Yes, Commander?" before the door shut behind Asuka and cut off the rest of the conversation.  
“好，”赤木说，点燃了她的报酬，回头继续工作。明日香领会了暗示，离开了她的办公室。她离开时，听到医生的电话铃响，女人接起电话，以“是的，指挥官？”开头，随后门在她身后关上，切断了余下的对话。

_That was worth the effort._ Asuka had forgone sleeping in after her exertion the previous day to track down a cigarette vending machine in the Geofront. She had known that making a last-minute change to her schedule would cause an upset with Doctor Akagi and had figured that a kickback of coffee would not be enough, in that instance, to smooth over any troubles. One act of petty theft later, she had obtained the ammunition necessary to ensure her success.  
这一切努力都是值得的。明日香在前一天的劳累后放弃了睡懒觉，只为在 Geofront 找到一台香烟贩卖机。她知道临时改变计划会让赤城博士不悦，也明白仅凭一杯咖啡恐怕不足以平息风波。一次小小的盗窃之后，她获得了确保成功的必要弹药。

She did not make it far from the office, mulling over some of the details she would be setting up for her new simulation training, before being interrupted.  
她没走多远，就在办公室附近徘徊，思考着新模拟训练的一些细节，却被打断了。

"Asuka! I'm glad I ran into you here; I was just on my way to talk to Rits." Misato, dressed in her normal black dress and red jacket, though this time with her red beret cocked at a precarious angle on her head, smiled at the pilot, bringing the younger woman's attention back to her immediate surroundings. She was stopped directly in Asuka's path, forcing her to address the chat. "I've got good news!"  
“明日香！真高兴在这儿遇到你；我正要去和丽说话呢。”美里穿着她平常的黑色连衣裙和红色夹克，这次头上还歪戴着红色贝雷帽，微笑着看向驾驶员，让年轻女子的注意力回到了周围环境。她直接挡在了明日香的路上，迫使她不得不回应这段对话。“我有好消息！”

_NERV lifted their no-alcohol-on-the-clock policy?_ "What is it, Misato?" Asuka asked tiredly, not showing the scowl that wanted to naturally form.  
NERV 取消了工作时间内禁止饮酒的规定？“怎么了，美里？”明日香疲倦地问道，没有显露出原本想要自然形成的皱眉。

Misato's grin widened, and the joyful energy she displayed banished any thought that she had been working well into the night for the past few days. "The Commander approved Ayanami's move!" She struck a small triumphant pose, one hand perched on her canted out hip, the other throwing up a "v" sign, and winked.  
美里的笑容扩大了，她展现出的欢乐能量驱散了任何她过去几天一直工作到深夜的想法。“指挥官批准了绫波的搬家！”她摆出了一个小小的胜利姿势，一只手搭在她倾斜的臀部上，另一只手比出“V”字，眨了眨眼。

"Of course he did," Asuka scoffed, though she did allow herself a victorious grin of her own. "My logic was flawless, after all. Where is she moving in the Geofront?" _Oh, no_, she thought, as a terrible idea came to her. _Don't tell me they moved her right next to me._ Working to be more cordial with the other pilot still did not mean she was willing to be _that_ close to her.  
“当然他批准了，”明日香嗤之以鼻，尽管她确实让自己露出了一丝胜利的微笑。“毕竟我的逻辑是无懈可击的。她要搬到 Geofront 的哪里？”哦，不，她想，一个糟糕的主意浮现在脑海中。别告诉我他们把她搬到了我隔壁。努力与其他驾驶员更友好相处并不意味着她愿意与她那么亲近。

"Well," Misato began, and her huge smile shifted into a coy grin as she leaned into Asuka conspiratorially. "She's not moving into the Geofront."  
"好吧，" 美里开口说道，她那大大的笑容随即变成了狡黠的微笑，她凑近明日香，像是在密谋什么。"她不会搬到地下来。"

Asuka's smile immediately dropped into a glower. "What do you mean? If she's not moving here, where would she move?" She planted her fists on her hips and stared down Misato, as much as she could with the older woman's height advantage, as if she could enforce her desired outcome through willpower alone.  
明日香的笑容立刻变成了皱眉。"你什么意思？如果她不搬到这里，她会搬去哪儿？" 她双手叉腰，尽管身高不及美里，却还是尽力瞪着她，仿佛仅凭意志力就能迫使事情如她所愿。

"She's moving in with me!" Misato crowed. The color drained from Asuka's face. The dread she had felt earlier at the possibility of the First Child accosting her at all hours of the night with inane queries and monotone exchanges was instantly replaced with scenes of the other two pilots lounging in the Katsuragi apartment. Shinji making dinner while Rei watched. Shinji listening to music while Rei sat nearby reading a magazine. Shinji doing homework while Rei helped him understand the material. Shinji reading with his headphones in while Rei was sitting bored at the kitchen table— "Wh-what?" Asuka almost whispered, but her fear was quickly subsumed by anger. "What?!" She exploded.  
"她要搬来和我一起住！" 美里得意地说道。明日香的脸色顿时变得苍白。之前她对第一适格者可能在任何时间来打扰她，提出无聊问题或进行单调对话的担忧，立刻被另外两位驾驶员在葛城公寓里悠闲生活的画面所取代。真嗣在做晚饭，而零在旁边看着。真嗣在听音乐，零坐在附近读杂志。真嗣在做作业，零在帮他理解材料。真嗣戴着耳机看书，零无聊地坐在餐桌旁—— "什-什么？" 明日香几乎低声说道，但她的恐惧很快被愤怒所吞没。"什么？！" 她爆发了。

"She can't live with you!" Asuka yelled, advancing closer to Misato and forcing the other woman to take a step back. "She's supposed to live in the Geofront! And it's always been said that boys and girls shouldn't sleep together after age seven!"  
“她不能和你住一起！”明日香大喊着，逼近美里，迫使对方后退一步。“她应该住在地底城！而且一直都说，七岁以后男孩女孩就不该同床共枕了！”

"Well, you didn't have a problem with it a few days ago," Misato muttered, exasperation written on her face.  
"哎，几天前你对此还没意见呢，" 美里咕哝道，脸上写满了无奈。

"That was different!" Asuka insisted. "It was a temporary arrangement to get the First out of that prison cell she was living in. This isn't proper! It's indecent." Asuka crossed her arms over her chest and turned her head to the side, closing her eyes and _hmph_ing.  
"那不一样！" 明日香坚持道。"那只是为了让她从那个牢房般的生活中暂时解脱出来的权宜之计。这可不合适！太不体面了。" 明日香双臂交叉在胸前，把头转向一边，闭上眼睛哼了一声。

"That's surprisingly old-fashioned of you, Asuka. And it's a moot point anyway," Misato said, rolling her eyes at the display. "I may have exaggerated a bit. She's moving into an apartment in the same building as me. She's not staying in my spare room."  
"你这想法倒是出奇地守旧，明日香。而且这根本不是问题所在，" 美里说着，对她的表现翻了个白眼。"我可能有点夸大了。她会搬进和我同一栋楼的一间公寓里。她不会住在我家的客房。

Relief immediately flooded Asuka. Though, like her reaction to the thought of Rei and Shinji living together, she actively refused to consider the cause. "That still isn't what I planned."  
解脱感立刻涌上心头。然而，就像她对丽和真嗣同居的想法一样，她刻意不去深究原因。“那仍然不是我计划中的。”

Misato sighed. "I know, Asuka. But plans change. You being here in Japan right now is evidence of that, right?" Before the pilot could offer her opinion on that thought, Misato pushed on. "I took all of your arguments into consideration when I came up with my proposal to the Commander, but you neglected something important, Asuka."  
美里叹了口气。“我知道，明日香。但计划总是会变的。你现在就在日本，不就是证明吗？”在驾驶员有机会表达对此想法的看法之前，美里继续说道。“我在向司令提出建议时考虑了你所有的论点，但明日香，你忽略了一些重要的东西。”

"And what was that?" She growled.  
“那是什么？”她咆哮道。

"Ayanami's opinion on the matter. When I got home this morning, after reading your proposal, I found Ayanami still awake. For some reason she was messing with the door to her room, she said something about setting up an alarm. I didn't really get it, and I asked her not to do anything that would make me lose the security deposit. I've got car payments to make, I can't be risking money like that!" Misato chuckled while Asuka continued to sulk.  
绫波对此事的看法。今早回到家时，我读完你的提案后，发现绫波还没睡。不知为何，她在摆弄自己房间的门，说什么要装个警报器。我没太明白，还叮嘱她别搞出什么让我丢掉押金的事来。我还有车贷要还，不能这样冒险花钱！”美里轻笑，而明日香依旧闷闷不乐。

"Well, anyway, we started talking about how she felt about moving. What she'd said before the activation test earlier, about how she had fun with Shinji, had given me the idea that she would maybe want to stay with us." Asuka attempted to interject but Misato talked over her. "When I offered, she said she would like to. Well, actually, she said 'I believe it might be beneficial,' but that's just her way, I think.

"So, that's what I proposed to the Commander, using your points. Just slightly modified and adding a few of my own. He was against it, for some reason, and—" Misato grimaced. "We eventually compromised, thanks to the Sub Commander. She'll be moving into a unit just a few floors down from mine."  
“所以，这就是我向指挥官提出的建议，基于你的观点，稍作修改并加入了一些我自己的想法。不知为何，他一开始是反对的，而且——”美里皱了皱眉，“多亏了副指挥官，我们最终达成了妥协。她将搬到我楼下几层的一个单元居住。”

"Fine," Asuka grumbled. _This is ridiculous. I should have known Misato would mess this up._ "Don't expect me to head out to your place every day to check on her! Even if that building isn't falling apart like her old one was, she still needs someone to make sure she doesn't just turn it into a mess like before!"  
"好吧，" 明日香咕哝着。这太荒谬了。我早该知道美里会搞砸的。"别指望我每天去你那儿看她！就算那栋楼不像她以前的房子那样摇摇欲坠，她还是需要有人确保她不会像以前那样把它弄得一团糟！"

"I'll just have Shinji do it," Misato chuckled. "He's a good boy, he'll take care of her. He'll probably be spending a lot of time at her place anyway. Walking to and from school and NERV, making her meals, working on homework together," Misato trailed off with a playful lilt and grinned smugly at Asuka. "They're so cute together, don't you think?"  
"我会让真嗣去做的，" 美里轻笑道。"他是个好孩子，会照顾好她的。他大概也会经常在她那儿待着。上学和去 NERV 的路上，给她做饭，一起做作业，" 美里带着调皮的语气拖长了声音，得意地对明日香笑着。"他们在一起多可爱啊，你不觉得吗？"

She glared in return. "You're disgusting, Misato." _I can't believe this is happening. NERV leaves me to live alone all my life until some unhinged plan requires me to move in with someone, but at the slightest provocation they move the Commander's Pet in with the Commander's son._ "I have something to work on that needs to be finished before tonight's training. I'm leaving." Asuka made to stomp past Misato but was stopped when the older woman gripped her shoulder as she walked by.  
她回瞪了一眼。“你真令人作呕，美里。”我简直不敢相信这一切。NERV 让我独自生活至今，直到某个疯狂的计划需要我搬去和某人同住，但只要稍有挑衅，他们就把指挥官的宠物安排到指挥官儿子的身边。“我有件事需要在今晚训练前完成。我要走了。”明日香试图从美里身边大步走过，却被年长的女人在她经过时抓住了肩膀。

"What are you working on?" She asked softly, turning to face her. Her expression was open, holding none of the teasing she was broadcasting just moments ago.  
“你在忙什么？”她轻声问道，转身面对她。她的表情坦诚，没有了一刻钟前那种戏谑的神情。

"I'm setting up simulation training. We need to learn how to fight as a team, so I'm having the Magi mock up some battles for us to fight together," Asuka said shortly, refusing to look at the older woman.  
“我在设置模拟训练。我们需要学会团队作战，所以我让 MAGI 模拟了一些战斗场景，让我们一起练习，”明日香简短地说，拒绝看向年长的女人。

"That's great. I'll help you with that, I just need to talk to Rits first. Meet you up on the bridge?" Misato asked with a reassuring smile.  
"那太好了。我会帮你，不过得先和丽子谈谈。在桥上见？" 美里带着安心的微笑问道。

"Whatever," Asuka grumbled, not reassured. _This isn't a fridge full of beer, it's not like you'll be of any help getting through it._ She made her way down the hall from Misato, who watched her leave before turning back to enter her friend's office.  
"随便吧，" 明日香嘟囔着，并未感到安心。这不是一冰箱的啤酒，你帮不上什么忙的。她从美里身边走过，沿着走廊离开，美里目送她离去后，转身回到朋友的办公室。

Ω

"I'm not sure that's the best idea," Misato said with a small frown. She was standing behind Asuka, who was seated at what had become her usual seat in the operations center, leaning over the girl and narrowing her eyes at the screen. Asuka's shoulders were hunched up and had been for quite some time. She suppressed a low growl at the criticism.  
“我不确定那是最好的主意，”美里微微皱眉说道。她站在明日香身后，后者正坐在操作中心的常座上，美里俯身靠近，眯起眼睛盯着屏幕。明日香的肩膀已经紧绷了许久，她强压下对这番批评的低吼。

"The best way to learn is to _do_," Asuka bit out instead.  
"最好的学习方式就是实践，"明日香咬牙切齿地说道。

"Sure, but you can take it a bit slower. The three of you have never fought together against one opponent before, let alone two."  
当然，但你们可以稍微放慢节奏。你们三人从未联手对抗过一名对手，更别提两个了。

_I never should have explained how this program works to her._ "All the more reason for us to learn as quickly as possible! We don't know what future Angels attacks will be like."  
我本不该向她解释这个程序的工作原理。“这更让我们有理由尽快学会！我们无法预知未来使徒的攻击会是什么样子。”

Misato stood up straight and shook her head slightly. "I'm not disagreeing with the intent of your training. Just the tempo." She smiled, which Asuka saw out of the corner of her eye, causing the pilot to scoff. "You didn't toss Shinji into the deep end of the pool for his first swimming lesson, right? It's the same principle here. Wait, you didn't do that, did you?"  
Misato 挺直身子，轻轻摇了摇头。“我不是反对你的训练意图，只是节奏问题。”她笑了笑，被 Asuka 眼角余光捕捉到，惹得这位驾驶员嗤之以鼻。“你没把 Shinji 第一次游泳就扔进深水区吧？这里也是同样的道理。等等，你不会真这么做了吧？”

"Of course not!" Asuka snapped. "It wasn't the deep end, I wasn't going to kill the Idiot!" The what should have been just a few minutes instructing the Magi on her simulation parameters having turned into a several hour back and forth with Misato had finally broken the last of her patience. "Fine, we'll go with _your_ plan. You _do_ have one, don't you?" She asked with a _huff_.  
"当然不是！" 明日香厉声道，"又不是深水区，我怎么会要了那白痴的命！" 本应只需几分钟向 MAGI 输入她的模拟参数，却演变成了与美里长达数小时的来回争执，终于耗尽了她最后的耐心。"好吧，就按你的计划来。你总该有个计划吧？" 她带着不满问道。

"I'm glad you asked," Misato answered, as if her enthusiasm could blot out Asuka's ire. "Just start with a two versus one scenario. Cycle between all three of you working in pairs until you're all comfortable fighting as a team of two. Then you can escalate the simulation to three versus—"  
"很高兴你问了，" 美里回答，仿佛她的热情能掩盖明日香的怒气。"先从二对一的场景开始。你们三人轮流组队，直到每个人都习惯两人一组的战斗。然后你们可以逐步提升模拟难度，变成三对——"

"But that's easier! It's supposed to get more difficult!" Asuka interjected, fingers splayed across the keyboard in front of her and brows drawn down.  
"但那样更简单！应该越来越难才对！" 明日香插话道，手指张开覆盖在面前的键盘上，眉头紧锁。

"No, it's supposed to build up your coordination," Misato said with a wave of her hand. "As I was saying, once all three of you are comfortable working in pairs, start fighting as a team of three against one Angel. Then you introduce a second opponent." Asuka made to interrupt again, but Misato spoke over her. "We'll have to make this recurring training for you kids, there's no way to squeeze all this into just one hour today."  
"不，这是为了锻炼你的协调性，" 美里挥了挥手说。"正如我刚才所说，一旦你们三人都习惯了两人一组的配合，就开始以三人团队对抗一个使徒。然后引入第二个对手。" 明日香正要再次打断，但美里抢先说道："我们得把这个训练作为你们的常规训练，今天不可能在一个小时内完成所有这些。"

Asuka seized on the first piece of good news she had heard that day. "I'll schedule some time every day after the regular hour," she said quickly.  
明日香抓住了那天听到的第一个好消息。"我会每天在常规训练后安排一些时间，" 她迅速说道。

Misato chuckled in response. "No, no, that won't do, Asuka. Let's figure out those logistics later, ok? I want to see how the first session goes before I make a decision on that."  
Misato 轻声笑道：“不，不，Asuka，那样可不行。我们稍后再讨论那些后勤问题，好吗？我想先看看第一场会议的情况，再做决定。”

_You keep hijacking my plans, the least you could do is let me set my own schedule. But I lost the time management argument before even setting foot in the Geofront, when the drunk changed my training plan without even telling me about it first. Just drop it for now, and when she sees how terrible a fight against two Angels will go she'll have to agree with me._ "Fine," Asuka said flatly, in what was quickly becoming her most used word of the day.  
你总是打乱我的计划，至少让我自己安排时间吧。但我在踏入第三新东京市之前，就已经在时间管理上败下阵来，那个醉鬼未经我同意就擅自改了我的训练计划。现在先别提这事，等她见识到同时对付两个使徒有多糟糕，她自然会同意我的。“好吧，”明日香冷冷地说道，这个词似乎成了她今天最常用的词。

"Great!" Misato exclaimed. "Go ahead and finish that up, then. Shinji and Rei should be arriving soon. I'll see you later, Asuka." Her work complete, and, as far as a certain pilot was concerned, disaster wrought, Misato turned to leave with a wave and a smile.  
“太好了！”美里欢呼道，“那就继续完成吧。真嗣和绫波应该快到了。回头见，明日香。”她的任务完成了，而对某位驾驶员来说，灾难已然降临，美里挥手微笑着转身离去。

Ω

Asuka sat in her simulation plug with a smug expression as she watched the aftermath of her fellow pilot's first mock tandem battle against an Angel.  
明日香坐在她的模拟驾驶舱里，脸上带着得意的表情，观看着她的同伴驾驶员首次模拟双人战斗对抗使徒后的情景。

"Ok, let's try that again," Misato said with a groan, shaking her head and covering her face with her palm. The video feed of the station where Maya was running the simulation from was displayed next to the view of the faux skirmish in front of Asuka, who was disgusted with the poor performance but perversely happy to see the team trip over each other in close quarters combat. "Rei, you're doing well trying to stay out of Shinji's way, but you need to attack with him. Shinji, you're too focused on the enemy. Pay attention to where Rei is, as well, so she isn't doing all the work trying to coordinate her movements with yours."  
“好吧，我们再来一遍，”美里叹了口气说，摇着头并用掌心遮住脸。从真希那里运行模拟的站点的视频被显示在明日香面前，旁边是模拟战斗的画面。明日香对这种糟糕的表现感到厌恶，但又幸灾乐祸地看着团队在近距离战斗中互相绊倒。“丽，你做得很好，试图避开真嗣，但你需要和他一起进攻。真嗣，你太专注于敌人了。注意丽的位置，这样她就不必独自努力与你协调动作了。”

"Yes," Rei answered immediately.  
“是的。”丽立刻回答道。

"Umm, right. Ok," Shinji responded a few beats after.  
“嗯，好的。”几拍之后，真嗣回应道。

The digital recreation of Unit 01 held in the grip of the Third Angel, with Unit 00 tangled in its umbilical, dissolved in front of Asuka's eyes. It was replaced by an umarred Tokyo-III, Unit 01 and Unit 00 standing ready to intercept a threat.  
数字再现的初号机被第三使徒紧紧钳制，零号机与其脐带缠绕，这一幕在明日香眼前消融。取而代之的是完好无损的第三新东京市，初号机与零号机严阵以待，准备拦截威胁。

Ω

Asuka watched as Shinji brought a pallet rifle to bear against the foe and shook her head as, just half a second later, Rei, jumping forward with a knife at the ready, was between the incoming rounds and their target. Shinji was too slow to notice and continued to fire into the other Eva's back.  
明日香看着真嗣举起一把步枪对准敌人，随即摇了摇头，因为仅仅半秒钟后，跃身前冲、手持利刃的绫波已经挡在了来袭的子弹和目标之间。真嗣反应太慢，未能察觉，继续向另一台 EVA 的背后射击。

"Muzzle awareness, Third!" Asuka snapped. "We've been over this before!" She smiled smugly despite no video feed from her position being available for Shinji to see. "Or perhaps you're tired of living with the First already?" The insincere curiosity dripped from her voice.  
“注意枪口方向，第三！”明日香厉声道，“我们之前不是讨论过这个吗！”尽管没有视频信号从她的位置传给真嗣看，她还是得意地笑了。“还是说，你已经厌倦和第一呆在一起了？”她声音中那不真诚的好奇意味溢于言表。

"Asuka, that's enough. But she's right, Shinji. And don't just fire an entire magazine like that at one time, your shots will go wild and the dust and debris they kick up will offer concealment to the target."  
"明日香，够了。但她说的没错，真嗣。别一次性打光整个弹匣，那样你的子弹会散乱，扬起的尘土和碎片反而会给目标提供掩护。"

"Not to mention the destroyed buildings, even homes—maybe you actually want _more_ roommates, just not the First?" The same disingenuous tone she had used earlier once more suffused her voice, which caused Misato to shoot her a disapproving glare.  
“更别提那些被毁的建筑了，就连家——或许你真想多几个室友，只是不包括真嗣君？”她再次用上了先前那种不真诚的语气，这让美里不满地瞪了她一眼。

"Just reset the simulation, Maya," Misato said after shaking her head.  
“重置模拟吧，真嗣，”美里摇头后说道。

Ω

"He beat this one solo, this shouldn't be so difficult," Misato groaned from around her hands covering her face. It came over a private communication channel to Asuka who was sneering at the Third Angel throwing Unit 01 into Unit 00, causing both Evas to tumble to the ground. "Reset it again, Maya," Misato said as she dropped her hands to her hips and reclaimed her normal supportive demeanor.  
“他单枪匹马就干掉了这个使徒，这应该没那么难啊，”美里从双手捂脸的指缝间嘟囔道。这番话通过私人通讯频道传到了明日香那里，她正冷笑着看着第三使徒将初号机甩向零号机，导致两台 EVA 一起摔倒在地。“再重置一次，真希波，”美里说着放下双手叉在腰间，恢复了她一贯的支持者姿态。

Ω

It was well past the hour mark that would denote the usual end of Asuka's planned training periods. Despite Asuka not participating in the training herself yet, she was finding it to be one of the more enjoyable sessions.  
早已过了通常标志着明日香计划训练时段结束的时间点。尽管明日香本人尚未参与训练，但她发现这是其中一次更为愉快的训练。

"Reset," Misato sighed. “重置，”美里叹息道。

Ω

_That looked like it hurt. Come on, I_ know _I trained you better than that._  
看起来挺疼的。来吧，我知道我教你的可不止这些。

"Really? Maya—" Asuka watched the simulation reset before Misato could finish her sentence.  
"真的吗？真嗣——" 明日香看着模拟训练在美里说完之前重置了。

Ω

"Again." Misato no longer sounded supportive.  
"再来一次。" 美里不再显得支持。

Ω

"That's enough for today," Misato finally conceded.  
"今天就到此为止吧。"美里最终让步道。

Asuka extricated herself from the simulation plug and resisted the urge to berate her fellow pilots one last time. _You made_ me _look bad, Third, and I didn't even get to fight. This was more of a disaster than I thought it would be._  
明日香从模拟插入栓中挣脱出来，强忍着最后一次斥责她那些同伴驾驶员的冲动。你们让我显得很糟糕，三号机，我甚至都没能打一场。这比我想象的还要糟糕得多。

Once descended from the plug, she left the large hangar-like space before either of her fellow pilots could attempt conversation with her. Her hurried walk to the locker room was interrupted by Misato, waiting just outside her destination.  
从插座上下来后，她迅速离开了那个宽敞如机库的空间，没给任何一位同伴试图与她交谈的机会。她匆忙走向更衣室，却在目的地外被美里拦住了去路。

"I _told_ you this would happen, Misato," Asuka snapped as she attempted to brush past the older woman and into the room to change.  
“我就说会这样吧，美里，”明日香一边急躁地说着，一边试图从年长的女人身边挤过去，进房间换衣服。

Misato dropped an arm across the door to bar the way. "Let's skip to the part where we agree to fix this, ok?" She said with a shaky smile.  
Misato 将一只手臂横在门前，挡住了去路。“我们跳过争执，直接达成修复协议，好吗？”她带着颤抖的微笑说道。

"I already know how to fix this," Asuka grumbled directly into Misato's arm while standing in front of the door. "_Someone_ already decided not to go with my plan."  
“我已经知道怎么解决这个问题了，”明日香咕哝着，直接对着美里手臂说道，站在门前。“有人已经决定不采纳我的计划。”

"Well, _someone_ is saying you were right, and we should probably make this the focus of the Langley Pilot Training Foundation," Misato replied with a roll of her eyes.  
"好吧，有人说你是对的，我们或许应该将此作为兰利飞行员培训基地的重点，"美里翻了个白眼回答道。

"That's not what it's called!" Asuka reached out to push the woman's arm out of her way, but Misato dropped it down to let her hand fall on the girl's shoulder, holding her in place. _You're pushing your luck, Misato,_ Asuka silently fumed, the temptation to engage in some of the close quarters combat she missed out on earlier rising within her.  
"那不是它的名字！"明日香伸手想推开女人的手臂，但美里却将手放下，轻轻搭在女孩的肩上，让她动弹不得。你这是在自找麻烦，美里，明日香心中暗暗恼火，那种因错过之前的近身格斗而升起的冲动再次涌上心头。

"Look, I'm still saying that you kids need time away from NERV business, so we can't be doing this all day for every session. But why don't we limit the scope of Eva Academy—"  
"听着，我还是认为你们这些孩子需要远离 NERV 的事务，我们不能每次都这样一整天。不过，我们何不限制 Eva 学院的范围——"

"It isn't Eva Academy either!"  
"这也不是 Eva 学院的事！"

"—to just this simulation training for the foreseeable future. I'll even agree to letting you take a few extra hours every day—at least until we see some improvements."  
“——在可预见的未来，仅限于此模拟训练。我甚至同意你每天多花几个小时——至少在我们看到一些进步之前。”

"Fine," Asuka bit out. "Five hours, and you let me control the scenarios."  
"好吧，" 明日香咬牙切齿地说。"五个小时，而且让我控制场景。"

Misato laughed. "I'm not pulling them out of school every day. You get three, and I'll be overseeing the training. That's non-negotiable."  
美里笑了。"我不能每天都把他们从学校里拉出来。你只有三次机会，我会监督训练。这是没得商量的。"

"Aarrggh! Fine!" Asuka yelled, and she attempted to stomp into the locker room. The captain's grip, however, was stronger than she had expected.  
“啊啊啊！好吧！”明日香大喊着，试图跺脚走进更衣室。然而，队长的手劲比她预想的要强得多。

"Let Rits know, will you? I'd do it myself, but I've got a conference to get ready for. Some JSSDF contractors think they've managed to build some machine that can beat the Angels. It doesn't even have an AT-Field!" Misato cocked her head slightly. "Say, maybe you should come too. Let those idiots get a first-hand account of what fighting an Angel is like straight from an expert."  
“告诉律子一声，好吗？我自己去说也行，但我得准备个会议。有些日本自卫队承包商以为他们造了台能打败使徒的机器，连 AT 力场都没有！”美里微微歪了歪头，“对了，或许你也该来。让那些蠢货从专家这儿亲耳听听与使徒战斗是什么样的。”

Asuka sneered. "Like I care about any of that. Take care of it yourself, Misato. You seem to be doing plenty of that already." She again attempted to make her way past the officer and was again stopped by her grip.  
明日香嗤之以鼻。“我才不在乎那些呢。你自己处理吧，美里。你看起来已经够忙的了。”她再次试图从警官身边走过，却又被她的手拦住了。

"Do you want to come to my place for dinner tonight, Asuka?" She asked softly, finally letting her hand fall from the girl's shoulder.  
"今晚想来我家吃晚饭吗，明日香？" 她轻声问道，终于将手从女孩的肩上放下。

"I'm busy," Asuka said curtly. "_Someone_ has to take some responsibility around here." _How pathetic._ She, at last, stomped her way into the locker room, accompanied by a raised eyebrow and small frown from Misato.  
“我很忙，”明日香简短地说道，“总得有人在这里负点责任。”真是可悲。她终于跺着脚走进了更衣室，身后是美里微微挑起的眉毛和小小的皱眉。

Ω

Asuka stalked down the NERV hallway leading away from Doctor Akagi's office, for the second time that day. After a not-quite-argument over scheduling, for the second time that day. And was interrupted partway down the hallway, for the second time that day.  
明日香沿着 NERV 的走廊大步离开赤木博士的办公室，这是当天第二次了。因为日程安排上的争执，也是当天第二次。然后在走廊中途被打断，同样是当天第二次。

"Hey, kiddo." “嘿，小家伙。”

"Kaji!" Asuka immediately spun around and ran towards her guardian, plastering on her best attempt at a genuine smile as she wrapped up one of his arms in her own. _Thank god you're here. This day has been a disaster._ "Where have you been? I missed you!" She affected a slight pout, trying to make the curve of her lips as seductive as possible.  
"加持！" 明日香立刻转身朝她的监护人跑去，一边用尽全力挤出一个真诚的微笑，一边将他的手臂紧紧抱在自己怀里。感谢上帝你来了。今天真是糟透了。"你去哪儿了？我好想你！" 她故意撅起嘴，试图让唇角的弧度尽可能诱人。

The man placed his free hand on her head as if to ruffle her hair, but seemed to think better of that notion. "Oh, I've been around. Staying busy. Just like you, from what I hear."  
那人用空着的手轻放在她的头上，似乎想揉乱她的头发，但随即又改变了主意。“哦，我一直都在忙。保持忙碌，就像我听说的你一样。”

"Busy is one word for it," Asuka mumbled into his shirt as she buried her head into his shoulder. "This day has been awful, Kaji. Take me out to dinner?" She pleaded, ignoring how that so rarely worked. _I just want one good thing today._  
“忙碌，算是吧，”明日香埋头在他衬衫里咕哝着，将脸颊贴在他的肩上。“今天真是糟透了，加持。带我去吃晚餐吧？”她恳求道，尽管她知道这很少奏效。“我今天只想有一件好事。”

"Sorry, Asuka, I'm still working on some things tonight. There's a big event coming up that NERV has to look its best for in front of civilians. I'm supposed to make sure we show up the competition. Why don't you have dinner with Shinji, you two have been getting along so well." Kaji began walking down the hall again, Asuka falling into step beside him with his arm still entrapped.  
“抱歉，明日香，今晚我还在忙一些事情。NERV 有个大活动要面对公众，我们得展现出最佳状态。我得确保我们能胜过竞争对手。不如你和真嗣一起去吃晚餐吧，你们俩最近相处得挺好的。”加持再次开始沿着走廊走去，明日香紧随其后，他的手臂仍被她紧紧挽着。

"Hmph," Asuka turned her nose up at his proposal. "You know I'm not interested in spending time with boring little _boys_ like him. You're the _man_ for me, Kaji."  
“哼，”明日香对他的提议嗤之以鼻，“你知道我对和那种无聊小男孩共度时光没兴趣。你才是我的菜，加持。”

"Oh?" Kaji asked with a grin. "So, it's not Shinji who's caught your eye. Maybe you're more interested in Rei, then?" Asuka's face blanked at the notion, though her brows began to draw down in anger as she slowly released her grip on the man. "It's starting to make sense, now, your insistence on moving her into the Geofront. You wanted her close, right?"  
"哦？" 加持笑着问道，"这么说，吸引你的不是真嗣。那你可能对绫波更感兴趣了？" 听到这个说法，明日香的脸色一僵，尽管她的眉头开始因愤怒而紧皱，慢慢地松开了对男人的抓握。"现在开始说得通了，你坚持让她搬到地下来住。你是想让她靠近你，对吧？"

_You—how dare you! What are you saying?! I hate that doll!_ Asuka stopped walking with him, causing Kaji to halt his own forward progress. "And mean-old-Misato just had to go and ruin it, huh? I mean, she told me you were upset with her, but—"  
你——你怎么敢！你在说什么？！我讨厌那个玩偶！明日香停下脚步，让加持也跟着停了下来。"而且坏心眼的美里非得把它搞砸，是吧？我是说，她告诉我你对她很生气，但是——"

"Shut up!" Asuka roared, stomping her foot down in emphasis. Kaji quickly turned to her in surprise, having not been the target of her anger for quite some time. "You don't have any idea what you're talking about! Who even asked you?!"  
“闭嘴！”明日香咆哮道，用力跺脚以示强调。加持惊讶地迅速转向她，已经很久没有成为她怒火的对象了。“你根本不知道自己在说什么！谁问你了？！”

"Asuka? Are—" "明日香？是——"

"No! I don't want to hear it!" _Even you're part of this now!_ Asuka's face twisted into a scowl as she pushed past Kaji to walk back towards her quarters. The man made one more attempt to call out to her, but she ignored him.  
“不！我不想听！”就连你也掺和进来了！明日香的脸扭曲成一团怒容，她推开加持，径直走回自己的房间。男人再次试图呼唤她，但她置若罔闻。

Ω

The corridors of NERV that led to her assigned spaces were devoid of people, as if her foul mood preceded her and warned away the other subterranean denizens in advance. Someone, however, had appeared to have missed the caution signs. As Asuka rounded the corner to her door, her angry gaze fell upon the Third Child standing meekly in front of it. _What are_ you _doing here._ The scowl she had worn since Kaji had angered her deepened as the other pilot's face perked up at her approach.  
通往她指定住处的 NERV 走廊空无一人，仿佛她的恶劣情绪先行一步，提前警告了其他地下居民避让。然而，有人似乎错过了警示标志。当明日香拐过转角来到门前时，她愤怒的目光落在了怯生生站在那里的第三适格者身上。你在这里做什么？自从加持惹恼她后，她脸上的怒容愈发深重，而另一位驾驶员看到她的到来，脸上却露出了欣喜的表情。

"Hi, Asuka!" Shinji said to her advancing figure. She offered no hint that she would reply. Instead, she did not even slow down as she approached, making clear her intention to just ignore him.  
"嗨，明日香！" 真嗣对着她渐行渐远的身影喊道。她没有流露出任何将要回应的迹象。相反，她连步伐都未曾放缓，径直走来，显然是打算直接无视他。

Seemingly unfazed, Shinji reached into a bag he was holding and pulled out a bento box. Asuka did not make a note that it was the same red one he had prepared for her just a few days ago. Nor did she sneak an inconspicuous peek into the bag to check for a blue one or, god forbid, a purple one. Those actions would have been beneath her. _So, you only brought one for me. You must have already left food for your special favorites at home._  
表面上毫不在意，真嗣伸手从他提着的袋子里拿出一个便当盒。明日香并未注意到那正是几天前他为她准备过的红色便当盒。她也没有偷偷瞥一眼袋子，看看是否有蓝色的，或者，天哪，紫色的。那些举动对她来说太掉价了。所以，你只给我带了一个。你肯定已经在家给你的特别宠儿们留好食物了吧。

"I brought this for you." Shinji held the container out to Asuka, who had finally stopped in front of her door. She turned to face the boy with as neutral an expression as she could manage. "I know the food here isn't very good. And I know you wanted to set up a—some kind of meal plan? Which we haven't had a chance to yet. But I remember you said what I had made _was_ good, and—" Shinji trailed off as Asuka did not respond to his rambling.  
“我给你带了这个。”真嗣将容器递给终于在她房门前停下的明日香。她尽可能保持中性的表情，转身面对男孩。“我知道这里的伙食不太好。我也知道你想制定一个——某种用餐计划？我们还没来得及讨论。但我记得你说过我做的菜不错，而且——”真嗣话音渐弱，因为明日香对他的絮叨没有回应。

"Umm, here," he said instead, jostling the box in her direction slightly in emphasis.  
“嗯，这里，”他改口道，为了强调，轻轻地将盒子推向她。

Asuka eyed the offering but made no move to accept it. "You were terrible in training today, Third," she said flatly.  
明日香盯着那礼物，却没有伸手去接。“你今天训练表现很糟糕，三号，”她平淡地说。

He winced at the criticism, but kept the oblation raised. "I'm—I know. I'll do better next time."  
他对这批评皱了皱眉，但还是保持着递出礼物的姿势。“我——我知道。下次我会做得更好。”

Asuka's eyes flicked between the promise of dinner in his hands and the promise of improvement written over top his determined, still nervous, face. _Fine._ She grabbed the bento box from his hands. "You'd better." She turned back to her door and slid her ID card through the reader, stepping through the doorway as soon as it was clear. When the door shut behind her, she leaned against it and slid down to sit on the ground with the bento box clutched to her chest. She ignored the heavy feeling in her chest, and the pit in her stomach. Instead, she listened to the sounds of the Third Child's footsteps fade away as he left her door.  
明日香的眼神在手中的晚餐承诺与那张写满决心却依旧紧张的脸庞之间来回游移。好吧。她从他手中夺过便当盒。“你最好说到做到。”她转身回到自己的门前，将 ID 卡刷过读卡器，门一开便跨了进去。门在她身后关闭时，她靠在门上，滑坐到地上，将便当盒紧抱在胸前。她无视了胸中的沉重感与胃里的空虚。相反，她聆听着第三适格者渐行渐远的脚步声，直到它们消失在她的门前。

Once she was sufficiently alone, she opened the Third Child's dinner and tentatively brought a piece of some cooked vegetable or other to her mouth and closed her eyes, hoping the meal might salvage at least some of the mess her day had been. _Those ungrateful leeches will get treated to this every day while I have to live on NERV cafeteria slop. Misato better—no!_ She slammed the lid back onto the bento after hastily spitting the small bite she had taken back into it as the truth revealed itself to her.  
一旦她独处，便打开了第三适格者的晚餐，小心翼翼地夹起一片不知名的熟蔬菜送入口中，闭上眼睛，希望这顿饭至少能挽救她糟糕透顶的一天。那些不知感恩的吸血鬼们每天都能享用这样的美食，而我却只能靠 NERV 食堂的残羹冷炙度日。美里最好——不！她急忙将那一小口吐回便当盒，猛地盖上盖子，真相已然昭然若揭。

_Damn it, Misato! "I'll just have Shinji take care of Rei, he's a good boy!" So, you send him crawling over to me, trying to make peace? It wasn't enough to drag Kaji into your bullshit?_ _Face me yourself, you coward!_ Asuka stood up, grasping the bento so tightly the box was shaking in her hands. _You undermine my authority all day, then top it off by telling the_ Third Child _to look after_ me_. Me! That's my fucking job!_  
该死，美里！“就让真嗣照顾丽吧，他是个好孩子！”所以你就把他推到我这儿来，试图和解？把加持也卷进你的烂摊子还不够吗？你自己来面对我啊，懦夫！明日香站起身，紧紧抓着便当盒，以至于盒子在她手中颤抖。你整天削弱我的权威，最后还让第三适格者来照顾我。我！那他妈是我的工作！

With her back still facing the door, she slammed her elbow into the button to open it. Once it _whoosh_ed open behind her, she threw the red bento box over her shoulder as hard as she could, splattering food across the hallway floor before impacting the far wall with a momentarily satisfying _crack!_ When the door closed again, she dropped back to the ground with her head in her hands. The empty feeling brought on by sampling her dinner intensified, but she ignored it. _I just want this day to be over. Momma, I miss you._  
她背对着门，猛地用肘部撞击按钮将其打开。门在她身后呼啸而开，她竭尽全力将红色便当盒甩过肩头，食物四溅在走廊地板上，随后砰的一声撞在远处的墙上，发出短暂令人满足的碎裂声！当门再次关闭时，她双手抱头瘫坐在地。品尝晚餐带来的空虚感愈发强烈，但她置之不理。我只想这一天快点结束。妈妈，我想你。

### Chapter 11

Αδικεί πολλάκις ο μη ποιών τι, ου μόνον ο ποιών τι (A wrongdoer can be a man who has left something undone, not always one who has done something) — Marcus Aurelius, Meditations IX, 5  
未尽其责者常犯错，非仅行事者也（犯错之人，或因未行某事，而非仅因行事）——马可·奥勒留，《沉思录》卷九，5

Asuka's hand was already turning off her alarm the moment it began to blare in the heavy darkness of her bedroom. She closed her eyes, the maddening LED readout of her clock's face still projecting splotchy ghosts on the back of her eyelids from staring for so long. She rose from her bed in an exhausted combination of stiff muscles and heavy limbs and began moving in her routine that was so achingly rote she would have been able to get herself ready in her sleep—not that she would ever have to, anyway, given her chronic lack in that department as of late.  
在卧室的浓重黑暗中，明日香的手已经伸向闹钟，在它开始尖锐地响起的那一刻就将其关闭。她闭上眼睛，闹钟那令人发狂的 LED 显示屏依然在她紧闭的眼睑后投射出斑驳的幽灵，这是长时间凝视的结果。她从床上起身，疲惫地结合了僵硬的肌肉和沉重的四肢，开始按照那令人痛苦的习惯性日常行动，即使是在睡梦中也能准备好一切——当然，考虑到她最近在这方面的持续不足，她永远也不需要这样做。

_Two hours until he makes breakfast._ Her legs had brought her to the shower. She turned it on. _More protein, fewer carbs from now on._ She was in front of her closet, laying out her uniform for the day. _Simulator training doesn't call for so many carbs._ She was undressed, her teeth already brushed, then standing in the shower. _Maintain the calorie amount, though. Or increase it?_ Soap, cleaning her skin. _They're both too small. Simulators don't train muscles._  
还有两个小时他才会做早餐。她的双腿已经带她来到了淋浴间。她打开了水。从现在开始，更多蛋白质，减少碳水化合物。她站在衣橱前，为今天准备着制服。模拟训练不需要那么多碳水化合物。她已经脱掉了衣服，刷好了牙，然后站在淋浴下。保持卡路里摄入量，还是增加？用肥皂清洁皮肤。它们都太小了。模拟器不训练肌肉。

Shampoo for her hair. The heat of the water soothed her aches. _School today, so they'll be walking together. Lunch?_ She jolted, nearly pulling her hair out of her hands as her head jerked up. Then she remembered. Calm returned. _Misato on the third day of every week, alternating weekends. He won't be bringing leftovers today._ Water rinsed through her hair.  
洗发水用于她的秀发。热水的热度缓解了她的疼痛。今天有学校，所以他们会一起走。午餐呢？她猛地一惊，差点把头发从手中扯出来，头猛地抬起。然后她想起来了。平静回归。每星期的第三天，轮流在周末。他今天不会带剩菜了。水流冲过她的头发。

_Make sure dinner accounts for anything lacking at lunch, or last night's dinner. He makes too many vegetables, not enough meat._ The shower stopped. _She doesn't even make food._ Towels, warm from the humidity, dried her.  
确保晚餐弥补午餐或昨晚晚餐的不足。他做的蔬菜太多，肉太少。淋浴停了。她甚至不做饭。毛巾，因湿气而温暖，擦干了她。

_Rerun the test program today, the results weren't accurate yesterday._ Bra, panties, socks. _Check Momma's transport. Then Akagi's office._ She scowled, the first expression she had made since entering her quarters the night before. Brush through her hair. _Ibuki's station. She's more malleable. Find what needs to be done that they won't bother with._ She stared at a dark shadow in her mirror as she sat at her dresser, not noticing when she had opened her eyes. Her lights rarely saw use, anymore. The girl in the mirror did not seem to notice their absence as she dropped the hairbrush on the ground and slipped neural connectors into her hair. The shadow started to turn, then Asuka lost sight of it as she moved to grab her uniform.  
今天重新运行测试程序，昨天的结果不准确。胸罩、内裤、袜子。检查妈妈的交通工具。然后是赤城办公室。她皱眉，这是她昨晚进入房间后的第一个表情。梳理头发。伊吹的岗位。她更容易被说服。找出那些他们不会费心去做的事情。她坐在梳妆台前，盯着镜子里的暗影，没注意到自己何时睁开了眼睛。她的灯光现在很少使用。镜中的女孩似乎并未注意到它们的缺失，她将梳子掉在地上，然后将神经连接器插进头发里。阴影开始转动，随后明日香移动去拿制服时，视线中失去了它的踪影。

_That will keep you busy with work until simulator training._ Shirt tucked into pants. _Supervise Misato's mess._ Blouse over shirt. Shoes on feet. _Exercise. Fourth day of the week, which means legs. Light cardio only._ Pockets filled with necessary weight. _Then back here. Clean and organize the mess. Get in bed._ She was standing at the door.  
这会让你忙于工作直到模拟训练。衬衫塞进裤子里。监督美里小姐的混乱。衬衫套在衬衫外。鞋子穿在脚上。锻炼。一周的第四天，意味着腿部训练。只做轻度有氧运动。口袋里装上必要的重量。然后回到这里。清理和整理混乱。上床睡觉。她站在门口。

She took a moment, her hand hovering over the button of her automatic door. A deep breath in, held, slowly released. _Less than six months total?_ She had never been able to account for the time she had been set aside. It clearly did not matter anyway.  
她停顿片刻，手悬在自动门的按钮上。深吸一口气，屏住，缓缓呼出。总共不到六个月？她从未能解释被搁置的那段时间。显然，这无论如何都无关紧要。

Asuka finally felt awake enough to wear her face. Her arms and legs felt more flexible than when she had set her alarm last night. She was even starting to be already annoyed with how many people were going to whisper about her behind her back in the cafeteria while she ate breakfast.  
终于，明日香感到足够清醒，可以戴上她的面具了。她的四肢感觉比昨晚设闹钟时更加灵活。她甚至已经开始对食堂里有多少人在她吃早餐时背后议论她感到恼火。

_Two months so far. Slightly less than that since I got here._ She unclenched her jaw. It could not have been tensed for long, her teeth barely even ached. "Just one more week, Momma," she whispered. "I'll see you soon. I love you." _You have to keep going. She's waiting for you._  
到目前为止两个月了。来到这里的时间稍微少一些。她松开了紧咬的牙关。应该没咬太久，牙齿几乎不怎么疼。“再坚持一周，妈妈，”她低声说，“我很快就能见到你了。我爱你。”你必须继续前进。她在等你。

She opened the door and stepped out.  
她打开门，走了出去。

Ω

Unit 01, crouched at the side of a building, released controlled volleys of fire into the Third Angel, taking brief pauses in between bursts of fire. The Angel advanced on his position, stomping down the empty street and brushing without care into the buildings on either side of it. Shinji, however, held his ground and kept his fire on the enemy.  
零壹号机蹲在建筑物旁，向第三使徒发射着控制的连射，在火力爆发之间短暂停顿。使徒向他逼近，踏过空荡的街道，毫不在意地撞向两侧的建筑物。然而，真嗣坚守阵地，继续向敌人开火。

Asuka watched this play out the same way it had played out ever since Misato had witnessed the disastrous first attempt at a coordinated attack against an Angel in the simulators. She yawned, the sound echoing in the simulator plug. _I am so sick of this fake shit._ She sighed when she saw Unit 00 moving through the city exactly as she knew the other pilot would be, following the same route she always followed in every iteration of every training session. _It's not even good training._ She snorted quietly at the thought that someone could _actually_ learn how to pilot by sitting in what amounted to little more than a bigger version of the Sega Saturn her once-friend Hikari had rarely used.  
明日香看着这一幕，如同自从美里目睹了在模拟器中对使徒协同攻击的灾难性首次尝试以来，每次都如出一辙。她打了个哈欠，声音在模拟器插入栓中回荡。我真是受够了这些假玩意儿。她叹了口气，看到零零号机在城市中移动，正如她所料，那位驾驶员总是沿着同样的路线，在每一次训练的每一次迭代中都一成不变。这甚至算不上是好的训练。她暗自嗤笑，心想有人居然能通过坐在一个比曾经好友光子几乎不用的世嘉土星大不了多少的装置里学会驾驶，真是荒谬。

Unit 00 was using the distraction Unit 01 had provided to maneuver on the Angel out of its sight. The First Child stalked through the vacant cityscape in what would have been stealth if Unit 00 were human sized. The intended effect was achieved regardless, as Unit 00 jumped into the Angel from behind, neutralizing its AT field and plunging a knife into its back while Unit 01 erupted from behind cover and sprinted forward the short distance remaining between it and the Angel.  
零号机利用初号机制造的干扰，悄然绕到使徒视线之外。如果零号机有常人大小，这一行动本该悄无声息。尽管如此，效果已然达成，零号机从背后跃向使徒，消解其 AT 力场，同时将利刃刺入其背部，而初号机则从掩体后爆发，疾驰向前，缩短了与使徒间的最后距离。

_And there you go. No different than the hundreds of other times you've had them run the same fight over and over again. We need_ real _experience, not this stuff, Misato!_  
就这样吧。和之前几百次重复同样的战斗没什么两样。我们需要的是实战经验，不是这些虚的，美里！

As Shinji plunged Unit 01's dagger into the Angel's core, the simulation paused. "Excellent work," Misato congratulated. "We've got time for one more round today, I think."  
当真嗣将初号机的匕首刺入使徒的核心时，模拟暂停了。“干得漂亮，”美里赞许道，“今天我们还有时间再打一轮。”

"I'm done watching, it's all I've done for weeks. Third, you're with me," Asuka snapped. _Even if it's simulated, I'd still rather fight than gawk._  
"我已经看够了，这几周来我一直在看。第三，你跟我一起，"明日香厉声说道。即便是模拟的，我也宁愿战斗而不是傻看。

"Ok, Asuka," Shinji answered as another copy of Unit 01 materialized to stand side by side with his in a virtual recreation of Tokyo III.  
"好的，明日香，"真嗣回答道，随即另一个零号机复制体在虚拟的第三新东京市中显现，与他并肩而立。

"Target is approaching from the east," Asuka said, glancing at one of the readouts displayed before her. The feeling of entering combat was starting to rise in her chest.  
"目标正从东面接近，"明日香瞥了一眼面前的显示屏说道。战斗的感觉开始在她胸中升起。

"I can get its attention so you can take it out," Shinji offered, his copy of Unit 01 turning to face the coming threat and shouldering a pallet rifle.  
"我可以吸引它的注意，这样你就能干掉它。" 真嗣提议道，他的 01 号机复制体转向逼近的威胁，肩扛着一把托盘步枪。

"No way, Third," Asuka scoffed. "I'm not waiting here for the Angel. Let's go." Without waiting for an acknowledgement, her copy of Unit 01 began sprinting towards the east. _Much better._ Even moving metaphorically felt better than sitting in place.  
“没门，三号，”明日香嗤之以鼻，“我才不会在这里等使徒呢。我们走吧。”不等回应，她的零一机开始向东疾驰。这样好多了。即便只是象征性地动起来，也比干坐着强。

"Wait for me!" Shinji called after her, scrambling to gather up extra weapons from the cache before following. _I've been falling asleep watching them accomplish nothing for so long._ Asuka could feel the expected combat burning away her tiredness to make way for the knife edge of thrill and drea—and just thrill, there was nothing else that she could feel beginning to bleed into her.  
“等等我！” 真嗣朝她喊道，匆忙从武器库中抓起额外的装备后紧随其后。我已经看着他们无所作为太久了，久到昏昏欲睡。明日香能感觉到预期的战斗正在燃烧掉她的疲惫，为那刀锋般的兴奋与梦想——以及纯粹的兴奋让路，除此之外，她再无其他感觉渗入。

Her throat felt tight as she kept her gaze darting about to keep an eye on her surroundings, alternating between the displays in front of her and the view through the eyes of the simulated Eva. She caught herself lingering on the sky but forced her attention back to the battlefield. _Stupid sims. Stupid NERV. Stupid Misato. They've got me losing my focus._  
她的喉咙发紧，目光四处游移，时刻留意着周遭环境，时而凝视眼前的显示屏，时而透过模拟 EVA 的视角观察外界。她发现自己竟对天空流连忘返，却强迫自己将注意力拉回战场。愚蠢的模拟训练。愚蠢的 NERV。愚蠢的美里。他们让我分了心。

"What are you doing?" Noises like voices echoed out of her comm system, but Asuka paid them no mind. She once more properly attuned her attention to the matter at hand and ejected her umbilical cable as she approached the limit of its range. _These computers can recreate the city so well I can navigate even while I'm distracted, but they never get the_ feel _of piloting right._ _I don't even feel my arms and legs moving like they should._ She could feel herself starting to pant, her heartbeat thundering in her ears.  
“你在做什么？”通讯系统中传来类似人声的嘈杂，但明日香并未理会。她再次将注意力集中于当前任务，随着接近脐带电缆的极限范围，她果断将其弹出。这些计算机能如此逼真地重建城市，即便分心我也能导航，但它们始终无法准确模拟驾驶的感觉。我甚至感觉不到手臂和腿应有的动作。她能感觉到自己开始喘息，心跳如雷鸣般在耳边回响。

"The next umbilical station is two hundred meters away. We're sending up more weapons, so plug yourself in, arm yourself, and standby for Shinji." _No, focus!_ Asuka attempted to force her breathing into control, it was so loud in her entry plug. _If I were really synched to my Eva I wouldn't get distracted._ Always making sure to stay aware of potential attacks from above or behind, she moved mostly on instinct: vaulting over shorter buildings, sliding around corners, and sprinting down straightaways.  
"下一个脐带站距离两百米。我们正在运送更多武器，所以请接入电源，武装自己，并准备迎接真嗣。"不，集中注意力！明日香试图控制自己的呼吸，它在插入栓内显得如此响亮。如果我真的与 Eva 同步，我不会分心。始终确保留意来自上方或背后的潜在攻击，她主要依靠本能行动：跃过较矮的建筑，绕过转角，沿着直道疾跑。

"Can you hear me, Asuka? Lieutenant, get me control of her radio." Trees snapped beneath her feet as they crashed into the street beneath her with each step, propelling herself ever forward through the forested Geofront. The deep shrieking of bursting timbers and the abrupt crashes of winged giants landing in the dirt accompanied the sight of the blurred, towering buildings to either side of her as she raced through the city towards the target.  
"你能听到我吗，明日香？中尉，帮我接通她的无线电。" 每迈出一步，脚下的树枝在她重压下断裂，随着她冲入街道，穿过森林覆盖的 Geofront，不断向前推进。断裂木材的尖锐嘶鸣与巨翼生物猛然落地扬起的尘土声，伴随着她疾驰于城市间，两侧模糊高耸的建筑，直奔目标而去。

Her copy of Unit 01 turned a final corner, her speed forcing her to use one hand to grab onto the building next to her and slingshot herself down the next street. The feeling of the smooth, metal grip on the massive blade kept the tightness in her chest at bay. "Shinji, she's reached the target. There's another umbilical station nearby, plug in and grab an extra for 'Professor Soryu.' She seems to have gone deaf.'" _Where the hell is Idiot Shinji?! Always hiding when I need him!_  
她的零号机转过最后一个弯角，速度迫使她单手抓住旁边的建筑物，借力将自己弹射至下一条街道。手中那把巨刃的金属握感，让胸中的紧绷感稍稍缓解。“真嗣，她已抵达目标地点。附近有另一个脐带站，插上电源并给‘碇教授’带一个备用。她似乎已经听不见了。”那个白痴真嗣到底在哪儿？！每次需要他的时候总是躲起来！

"I'll take care of this myself!" Asuka declared as she confronted the foe. _Momma, you're with me, aren't you?_ Her eyes, at once noting the sickly orange _3:35:87_ displayed under her active time remaining, jumped over the long white mask of a face to land on the shiny, bright red core in its chest.  
“我自己来解决这个！”明日香面对敌人宣告道。妈妈，你和我一起，对吧？她的目光，同时注意到自己剩余活动时间下显示的病态橙色 3:35:87，跳过那张长长的白色面具脸，落在了其胸前闪亮鲜红的核上。

"Seriously?! Just wait." Without giving time for the Angel to attack, Asuka bounded toward it while she cocked her arm behind her. Before she could make contact, however, an AT-field materialized directly between the combatants. _What? I—no, I'm just not taking this kid game seriously,_ she thought, as she slammed bodily into the field, momentarily knocked back.  
“真的吗？！等一下。”不给使徒攻击的机会，明日香朝它冲去，同时将手臂向后一甩。然而，在她能击中之前，一个 AT 力场在两者之间瞬间形成。什么？我——不，我只是没把这个小孩游戏当回事，她想着，身体猛地撞上力场，暂时被弹了回来。

This gave the Angel time to leap away from the incoming threat, though not for long before Asuka's fists began descending on the field. _Come on!_ She struck the barrier again, growling audibly as she struggled to get through. "This is the last one!" She yelled, putting as much strength as she could into punching her way through what was between her and the enemy.  
这给了使徒时间跳离逼近的威胁，尽管不久后明日香的拳头就开始猛击力场。来吧！她再次击打屏障，发出明显的咆哮声，努力想要突破。“这是最后一个了！”她喊道，尽全力将力量注入拳头，试图打破阻挡在她和敌人之间的障碍。

It shattered in response, and Asuka bounded through where it had been, knowing her target had to be just behind it.  
它应声而碎，明日香趁机穿过缺口，心中确信目标必定就在其后。

"Okay! That's enough!" _What? That's not—huh?_ Asuka thought as she heard a voice she had not heard. Ignoring it, she smirked as her assumption bore out. The cheerful scarlet target right where it was supposed to be. She snarled as she grabbed onto the core with one hand, crushing down on it as hard as she could. It resisted her grip, but she could feel it slowly giving way to the strength of her large, red armored hand.  
“好了！够了！”什么？这不对——嗯？明日香听到一个未曾听过的声音，心中疑惑。她无视那声音，嘴角勾起一抹笑意，因为她猜对了。那欢快的猩红目标正位于预期之处。她咆哮着，单手抓住核心，竭尽全力挤压。核心抵抗着她的握力，但她能感觉到它正逐渐屈服于她那巨大的红色装甲手掌。

Asuka blinked as she froze in place and belatedly recognized Misato's voice. She was in the simulator, the purple hand of the faux Unit 01 grabbing onto the core of the Third Angel. She noticed another Unit 01 standing just behind her own in the simulated city, frozen in the act of plugging an umbilical cable into her Eva.  
明日香眨了眨眼，僵在原地，这才迟钝地认出是美里在说话。她身处模拟器中，紫色假初号机的手正抓着第三使徒的核心。她注意到另一台初号机就站在自己模拟城市的后方，正定格在将脐带电缆插入她 EVA 的动作中。

"Can you hear me, Asuka?" Misato asked, less worry than agitation coloring her voice.  
"你能听到我说话吗，明日香？"美里问道，声音中更多的是焦急而非担忧。

"Ye—" She cleared her throat. "Yeah, what is it?" Asuka demanded, getting angry at the screen showing her superior's face.  
“叶——”她清了清嗓子。“是啊，什么事？”明日香厉声问道，对着屏幕上显示的上司面孔愈发恼火。

"Your comms cut out," Misato answered after a slight scoff. "I was trying to tell you to give Shinji a moment to catch up, but you couldn't hear me. Good job taking out the Angel, I guess?"  
"你的通讯断了。" 美里轻蔑地哼了一声后回答，"我正想让你给真嗣一点时间跟上，但你听不到我说话。干掉使徒，干得不错吧？"

"Whatever, thanks," Asuka muttered. "We done here? I'm tired of this simulator nonsense."  
“随便吧，谢谢。”明日香嘟囔道，“我们完事了吗？我受够了这模拟器的胡闹。”

Asuka paid no concern to whatever Misato had to say after the hatch to the simulator plug opened seemingly in response to her complaint. _Why am I so exhausted_, she thought as she exited the confined space not to enter into the Eva cages, as she had almost expected, but into the testing bay where NERV kept the entry plugs used for simulation training and other activities that did not require direct connection to an Evangelion.  
模拟器插头舱门似乎因她的抱怨而打开，但明日香对美里随后的任何话语都置若罔闻。她一边走出那个狭小空间，一边思索着为何自己会如此疲惫。本以为会直接进入 Eva 驾驶舱，结果却出乎意料地来到了测试区，那里是 NERV 存放用于模拟训练及其他无需直接连接 Eva 的活动的插头舱的地方。

_All I did was one round in the simulator, I need to get it together._ Despite how leaden her eyelids suddenly felt, she still instinctively checked above her as she clambered heavily down from the plug. Staring at her from the auxiliary bridge overlooking the bay was Captain Katsuragi with her left arm cradling her torso and her right holding her chin.  
我所做的不过是在模拟器里进行了一轮训练，我得振作起来。尽管眼皮突然变得沉重，她还是本能地抬头望去，当她从插头装置上笨拙地爬下时。从俯瞰着机库的辅助桥上凝视着她的，是左臂环抱身躯、右手托着下巴的桂木华队长。

Asuka rolled her eyes and trudged toward the exit. _Whatever. I just want a shower. Then maybe a meal. Then I have to be ready for tomorrow._ She could feel her plugsuit squeezing her clammy skin and dreaded to think of the mess her hair must be. _Not so bad as LCL but I still feel gross._ It was normally a short walk to the locker rooms from the testing area but Asuka's desire to avoid the other pilots, along with how tired she felt, made progress toward her goal slow.  
明日香翻了个白眼，拖着沉重的步伐向出口走去。随便吧。我只想洗个澡。然后或许吃顿饭。之后我得准备好迎接明天。她能感觉到紧身衣挤压着她潮湿的皮肤，一想到自己的头发肯定乱成一团就感到害怕。虽然不像 LCL 那么糟糕，但我还是觉得恶心。通常从测试区到更衣室的路很短，但明日香想要避开其他驾驶员，加上她感到疲惫，使得向目标前进的步伐变得缓慢。

_Come on, you're almost done for the day,_ she tried to encourage herself to overcome the drained feeling she was experiencing. _You can collapse when you get back to your bunk._ Her throat suddenly constricted at the thought of being too tired to make it to her bed. She remembered a time when her handler would, on rare occasion, deign to allow her to sleep in his bed when training had left her as drained as she was now. Even if he did sleep on the floor, or, more likely, not spend the night in his quarters at all, his kindness had comforted her. Even if the rejection had stung almost as much.  
加油，你今天快结束了，她试图鼓励自己克服这种疲惫感。回到铺位上再倒下吧。一想到可能累得连床都爬不上去，她的喉咙突然紧缩起来。她记得有一次，她的管理员在极少数情况下会屈尊允许她在训练让她像现在这样筋疲力尽时睡在他的床上。即使他睡在地板上，或者更有可能，根本不在房间里过夜，他的善意还是安慰了她。即使被拒绝的感觉几乎同样刺痛。

"Excuse me, Pilot Soryu," a blue and white blur murmured softly as Asuka barged into the female locker room.  
“不好意思，碇少校。”一个蓝白相间的身影轻声低语，随着明日香闯入了女更衣室。

"Watch where you're going, First," Asuka snapped automatically, sounding more fed up than angry. She did not bother to look up or wait for a reply. She barely made sure the door was closed before stripping off her plugsuit and tossing it on the ground. Shivering, she grabbed an armful of towels and shower necessities from her locker.  
"“看路，一尉，”明日香不假思索地厉声道，语气更多的是厌烦而非愤怒。她连头都懒得抬，也没等对方回应。她几乎没确认门是否关好，就脱下插入栓服扔在地上。她颤抖着，从储物柜里抓起一堆毛巾和洗浴用品。”

The distance between her locker and the showers seemed even greater than the trek to the locker room, but eventually Asuka made her way into a shower stall and, after some interminable waiting for the flow to heat up, finally felt the sweet release of warm water cascading over her. Coupled with the hot, steamy air and the soothing sensation of her fingers massaging the salty grime off of her scalp and out of her hair, Asuka lost track of time.
从她的更衣柜到淋浴间的距离似乎比走到更衣室还要远，但最终明日香还是走进了一个淋浴间。在无尽的等待水流变热之后，她终于感受到了温暖水流倾泻而下的甜美释放。伴随着热腾腾的蒸汽和手指按摩头皮、清除头发中盐分和污垢的舒缓感觉，明日香忘记了时间的流逝。

Ω

She emerged from the locker room not so reinvigorated as she might have hoped but nonetheless feeling up to tackling a meal before trying to bury the awful day she had had beneath her bed sheets. _If Misato puts us back in that simulator I'm going to scream._ The path between the locker room and the cafeteria was one she rarely travelled—either _before_ or _now_—and the empty hallways echoed with her lone footsteps as she walked. _I need to come up with something to get her off the idea of simulators._  
"她从更衣室出来，并没有像希望的那样焕然一新，但至少觉得可以应付一顿饭，然后再试图把糟糕的一天埋在床单下。如果美里再让我们进模拟器，我就要尖叫了。从更衣室到食堂的路她很少走——无论是以前还是现在——空荡荡的走廊回响着她孤独的脚步声。我得想个办法让她打消模拟器的念头。”

Asuka grimaced as she entered the mostly empty dining facility, the sterile reek of cleaning chemicals mixing with the mildly offensive odour of what could only charitably be called food to assault her nostrils. There was about as much variety on offer as she had in her choice of NERV uniforms, so Asuka just grabbed a tray and took the closest food options available before making her way to a table.  
明日香皱着眉头走进了这间基本空无一人的餐厅，清洁剂的刺鼻气味与勉强能称之为食物的轻微异味混合在一起，直冲她的鼻腔。这里提供的餐品种类与她在 NERV 制服选择上的多样性相差无几，于是明日香随手拿起一个托盘，就近取了些食物，然后走向一张桌子。

"I'd almost rather starve," she grumbled aloud as she grimaced at a bowl of what was supposed to be rice. "At least the Third made food that was edible." The grains were overcooked to the point of mushiness and tasted—Asuka decided not to notice the taste as she ate mechanically, moving on from the rice to something she did not look at. _How am I supposed to maintain my performance if I'm eating this garbage._  
"我宁愿饿肚子，"她对着一碗本该是米饭的东西皱眉抱怨道，"至少三号做的食物还能下咽。"这些米粒煮得过于软烂，口感如同糊状——明日香决定不去注意味道，机械地进食，从米饭转向她不愿细看的东西。吃这种垃圾，我怎么保持状态？

Her meal was interrupted by the _wumph_ of someone sitting across from her at her chosen table.  
她的用餐被对面座位上突然传来的“扑通”一声打断了。

"Still sticking to the dining facility, I see." Misato observed. "You know he always makes something for you, too." _Why can't people just let me work in peace._ Asuka caught the scent of lavender as it wafted over to her from the intruder's direction. She pretended not to notice the arrival, keeping her attention on her food as she scowled. _I only have to eat this food, then today is over._ _Except for waiting for tomorrow._ The soft clattering of a bento being opened reminded Asuka of why she was eating NERV cafeteria food.  
"还在坚持去食堂啊，我看。" 美里观察道，"你知道他总是会为你准备点什么。" 为什么人们就不能让我安静地工作呢。明日香闻到了从闯入者方向飘来的薰衣草香味。她假装没有注意到对方的到来，继续皱着眉头专注于自己的食物。我只需要吃掉这些食物，今天就算结束了。除了等待明天。打开便当盒的轻柔声响让明日香想起了她为什么在吃 NERV 食堂的食物。

"I'd normally eat with Rits if I were staying late enough to have dinner here," Misato said conversationally as she began to eat the premade meal Asuka was not sneaking the occasional glance at. _Almost anything would be better than this._ "But it seems even she has more of a social life than me these days." _Not enough protein, didn't I tell someone to do something about that already?_  
"如果我待得够晚，通常会和丽一起吃晚饭，" 美里边说边开始吃明日香不时偷瞄的预制餐。几乎什么都比这个强。"但最近看来，她甚至比我更有社交生活。" 蛋白质不够，我不是已经告诉过某人要处理这个问题了吗？

Asuka swallowed the stolid mush of what she declared to be a type of vegetable that she had been chewing on and deliberately took another bite. _Leave me alone, Misato._  
明日香咽下了她称之为某种蔬菜的坚硬糊状物，故意又咬了一口。别管我，美里。

The silence between them stretched into the awkward as the pair continued to eat and not look at one another. Asuka endured it hoping to force her opponent to concede.  
两人间的沉默逐渐变得尴尬，他们继续吃着饭，却不愿对视。明日香忍受着，希望以此迫使对方让步。

"Well, actually," Misato broke out casually, "she told me she was too busy with work tonight. But wouldn't it be more interesting if she were seeing someone and trying to cover it up?"  
“呃，实际上，”美里随意地插话道，“她说今晚工作太忙。但如果她是在和某人约会，试图掩盖这一点，会不会更有趣呢？”

_You're disgusting._ Misato, and the so-called rice she had just put in her mouth. _Who wants to think about an old hag doing_ that _with somebody._ Asuka had to redouble her efforts to not gag.  
你真恶心。美里，还有她刚塞进嘴里的那口饭。谁愿意去想一个老太婆和别人做那种事。明日香不得不加倍努力才没让自己吐出来。

"I'm just joking," Misato said quietly. Then, slightly louder. "She really _is_ married to her work—barely even makes time for her cats." She took some time to poke her chopsticks around her bento feigning picking at her food, but Asuka could see the box was empty as she continued to work through her own meal.  
“我只是在开玩笑，”美里轻声说道。然后，稍微提高了音量。“她真的是嫁给了工作——连陪猫的时间都少得可怜。”她花了一些时间用筷子在便当盒里拨弄，假装在挑拣食物，但明日香看得出来盒子里已经空了，而她自己则继续吃着饭。

"Your radio still broken or something, Asuka?"  
"你的收音机还是坏了还是怎么的，明日香？"

The girl jolted slightly, finally looking up to meet her superior's eyes while drawing her own brows down in anger.  
女孩微微一震，终于抬起头迎上上司的目光，同时皱起自己的眉头，流露出愤怒。

Only to be pre-empted when Misato smiled softly in response. "Another joke, sorry. I know what really happened."  
结果被美里温柔的微笑抢先回应了。“又是个玩笑，抱歉。我知道真正发生了什么。”

_What? No, I—_Asuka momentarily panicked but swiftly remembered her anger. _Nothing happened!_ "Or something, huh?" She said hotly, her voice shrill and loud enough to turn the heads of some of the cafeteria staff. They turned again, away this time, when they saw Asuka's intense glare directed at Misato.  
什么？不，我——明日香一时慌了神，但很快又想起了她的怒火。什么都没发生！“或者说，有点什么，嗯？”她热切地说道，声音尖锐响亮，足以让一些食堂工作人员转过头来。当他们看到明日香那锐利的目光直射向美里时，他们再次转过身去。

"Don't worry," she placated with her hands held up loosely in mock surrender. "I won't tell anyone else."  
“别担心，”她双手微微举起，做出一副假意投降的样子安抚道，“我不会告诉其他人的。”

"There's nothing to tell." Asuka declared after a _hmph_. She dropped her cutlery onto her tray, her forced appetite gone.  
“没什么可说的。”明日香哼了一声后宣布道。她将餐具丢在托盘上，强装的食欲已消失无踪。

"Right," Misato chuckled. "Our self-proclaimed 'lead pilot' just ignored all commands from the bridge and charged an Angel solo while her teammate had to sprint to not even make it in time to help." Misato shook her head and sighed airily while Asuka felt her face turn hot. "You forget, I've been around for a while. Not that I'm old! But I understand what you're going through."  
“没错，”美里轻笑道，“我们这位自称‘首席驾驶员’的家伙，刚刚无视了指挥部的所有指令，独自冲向使徒，而她的队友只能拼命奔跑，却还是没能及时赶到帮忙。”美里摇了摇头，轻叹一声，而明日香感到自己的脸颊发烫。“别忘了，我可是见过不少世面的。并不是说我有多老！但我理解你现在的心情。”

"There's _nothing_ to under_stand_," Asuka growled threateningly, hands gripping the edges of the table that she was now noticing would be so easy to vault over to close with her attacker. _Everything was normal. I was just distracted and couldn't hear and how can anyone expect a real professional like me to take a game like that seriously? I killed the Angel, that's what matters._ "It's just a stupid simulator. Nobody even cares what happened." _Just stop pretending to care._  
"没什么好理解的，" 明日香威胁性地咆哮道，双手紧抓着桌子的边缘，她现在才注意到这张桌子很容易就能翻过去接近她的攻击者。一切都很正常。我只是分心了，听不见，谁又能指望我这样的专业人士认真对待那种游戏呢？我击退了使徒，这才是关键。"这只是个愚蠢的模拟器。根本没人关心发生了什么。" 别再假装关心了。

"Asuka," Misato began exasperatedly, "I'm not planning any sort of disciplinary action, that would be ridiculous. So, stop denying—"  
"明日香，" 美里无奈地开口，"我没打算采取任何纪律处分，那太荒谬了。所以，别再否认——"

"_Disciplinary action?!"_ Asuka scoffed. "For _doing_ my _job?!_" _Thanks for the favour! And for dropping the act!_  
"纪律处分？！" 明日香嗤之以鼻。"为了做好我的工作？！" 多谢关照！还有，别再演戏了！

"No," Captain Katsuragi restarted deliberately, "for disobeying orders." Misato smiled again—Asuka suddenly wished to see what face Misato would make if she knew how many orders Misato herself had broken in the future fighting the Angels—but her voice still carried her weariness. "But like I said, that's not happening. Plus, I muted your comms as soon as I figured out what was going on. It's easier to say there was some malfunction where we couldn't hear each other rather than have to explain to my boss that my lead pilot—the Second _Child_—was bored and wanted to use NERV resources to blow off steam."  
“不，”葛城美里队长故意重新启动话题，“是因为违抗命令。”美里再次微笑——明日香突然好奇，如果美里知道自己在未来对抗使徒时违抗了多少命令，她会是什么表情——但她的声音依然透露出疲惫。“但就像我说的，这种情况不会发生。而且，我一发现情况不对就切断了你的通讯。说我们之间出现了某种故障，比向我的上司解释我的首席驾驶员——二号机驾驶员——因为无聊而想利用 NERV 资源发泄要容易得多。”

_Right! I was just blowing off steam—like a_ child_. It's that Idiot Shinji's fault anyway! If he had kept up with me no one would care that I killed the Angel so quickly because the Invincible Shinji would have gotten all the credit!_  
没错！我只是在发泄情绪——像个孩子似的。反正都是那个白痴真嗣的错！如果他当时能跟上我，没人会在意我这么快就干掉了使徒，因为无敌的真嗣会揽下所有功劳！

Misato shook her head ruefully as Asuka simmered. "Next time you feel like having a bit of fun like that, just let me know, ok? We'll work something out." _No one would care if the Third Child did it! You just hate me!_ Misato cocked her head to the side and squinted one eye at Asuka. "Kids still like airsoft guns and paintball, right? Shinji has some friends I'm sure he's _dying_ to introduce you to, you all can—"  
Misato 无奈地摇了摇头，看着 Asuka 气鼓鼓的样子。“下次你要是再想玩这种游戏，提前告诉我，好吗？我们总能想出办法的。”没人会在意第三适格者这么做！你就是讨厌我！Misato 歪着头，眯起一只眼睛看着 Asuka。“孩子们还是喜欢玩气枪和彩弹射击的，对吧？Shinji 有些朋友，我相信他很想介绍给你认识，你们可以一起——”

"Misato!" Asuka interrupted agitatedly. "No more kid stuff! We—they!—need _real_ training," she said haughtily, turning her nose up. _We certainly don't have time for school friends!_  
"“美里！”明日香不耐烦地打断道，“别再玩小孩子的把戏了！我们需要——他们需要——真正的训练，”她傲慢地说着，扬起鼻子。我们可没时间交什么学校朋友！”

"All right, all right," Misato answered. "Real pilot training only." The older woman's face scrunched up like she was considering saying something but had thought better of it. "Most of the people I served with would've loved to do some training like that," she almost whispered to herself. "But," she began, at a more conversational volume, "you're probably right, let's stick to more traditional methods." Misato suddenly turned grave. "Rits tells me I don't take my job seriously, too, but you're both wrong, you know."  
"“好了，好了，”美里回答，“只进行真正的驾驶员训练。”这位年长的女性皱起眉头，似乎在考虑是否要说些什么，但最终还是决定不说。“我以前的大多数战友都会喜欢那样的训练，”她几乎自言自语地低声说道，“但是，”她提高了些许音量，继续说，“你们可能说得对，我们还是坚持传统方法吧。”美里突然变得严肃起来，“律子说我对待工作不够认真，但你们都错了，你们知道。”

_Great. Now you've lumped me in the same category as Doctor Bottle Blonde, the famously bitchy._ "Then let us _train_. Properly train, Misato. This simulator nonsense is wasting time." Asuka detested how petulant she sounded but maintained a strong mask of determination.  
"“太好了。现在你把我归类为和那位著名的金发碧池同一类人了。”明日香继续说道，“那就让我们训练吧。认真训练，美里。这种模拟器游戏只是在浪费时间。”她讨厌自己听起来如此任性，但还是保持着一副坚定的面具。”

"I'm not so sure, but I can clearly see it's time to work some other things into the schedule and break things up." Misato began to gather up the detritus of her meal as she spoke. "For now, though, we're taking a few days off. Some down time will give us a clear perspective, then we can figure out how we want to move forward."  
"我不太确定，但我清楚地感觉到是时候在日程中安排一些其他事情，打破现状了。" 美里一边说着，一边开始收拾她餐后的残余。"不过眼下，我们打算休息几天。放松一下能让我们更清晰地看待问题，然后再决定下一步怎么走。"

"_Down time?!"_ Asuka asked incredulously. _The Sixth Angel is almost here, what do you mean_ down time_?!_  
"休息时间？！" 明日香难以置信地问道。"第六使徒就要来了，你说的休息时间是什么意思？！"

"Perhaps I wasn't clear," Captain Katsuragi said evenly. "I am ordering you, and the other pilots, to take a period of recovery. That means no working with Doctor Akagi, no testing, and no training. I don't even want you kids in the Geofront, though I realize that will still be an issue given your current living situation." Asuka felt her disbelief grow with every word the Operations Director spoke but bit her tongue when her superior's affect shifted back to informal. _You have to be joking, like before. You have to be_. "I keep telling you to take some time for yourself. Well, now I'm ordering it. Have some fun, Asuka. I know you don't like hearing it, but you're a teenage girl. Try to take advanta—."  
“或许我表达得不够清楚，”葛城美里队长语气平稳地说道，“我命令你，以及所有驾驶员，进行一段时间的休整。这意味着不得与赤木博士合作，不得参与测试，也不得进行训练。我甚至不希望你们这些孩子出现在地底都市，尽管考虑到你们目前的居住状况，这仍是个问题。”随着作战部长每说一句话，明日香的不敢置信愈发强烈，但在上司的态度转回非正式时，她咬紧了舌头。你一定是在开玩笑，就像之前那样。一定是的。“我一直告诉你要给自己放点假。现在，我正式下令。去玩乐吧，明日香。我知道你不喜欢听这些，但你毕竟是个少女。试着抓住——”

"I am _not_ some _child!_" Asuka emphasized her outrage with a fist slamming onto the table. "I am an elite pilot, and I don't have time for—for _time off!"_  
“我不是小孩子！”明日香用拳头猛击桌面，强调她的愤怒。“我是精英驾驶员，没时间——没时间休假！”

Misato frowned and took in a deep breath, holding it for a moment before releasing it. "If you want to spend your free time running errands for the science department and organizing training sessions for your peers, be my guest. But I _will_ make sure everyone knows _playing along_ with you is voluntary."  
Misato 皱起眉头，深吸一口气，屏息片刻后缓缓吐出。“如果你想利用空闲时间为科研部门跑腿，或是组织同伴进行训练，悉听尊便。但我会确保每个人都知道，配合你是出于自愿。”

Asuka's eyes widened and her nostrils flared. "Fine!" She shrieked. The girl stood up sharply, her chair clattering backwards behind her. Misato rolled her eyes in response as Asuka turned to leave. All the tenseness that the steam of the shower had relieved her of earlier had returned and now seemed to pour out of her as she walked.  
明日香瞪大了眼睛，鼻翼翕张。“好啊！”她尖叫道。女孩猛地站起身，椅子在她身后哐啷倒地。美里翻了个白眼作为回应，而明日香转身离开。先前淋浴的蒸汽缓解的紧张感此刻悉数回归，仿佛随着她的步伐倾泻而出。

"You're still on standby, obviously, and any other standing orders still apply. I know that bum Kaji doesn't set any rules for you, so other than that I don't care what you do for the next few days." Asuka tried to drown out the information with the stomping of her feet against the ground. It was not nearly as loud as she remembered a girl being when she broke down in the bathroom while no one outside did anything.  
"显然，你还在待命状态，其他既定指令依然有效。我知道那个懒鬼加持不会给你定什么规矩，所以除了这些，接下来几天你爱干嘛干嘛，我不管。" 明日香试图用脚重重踏地的声音来掩盖这些信息。这声音远没有她记忆中一个女孩在浴室崩溃时那么响亮，而外面的人却无动于衷。

_You've never cared about me.  
你从未在乎过我。_

"I've got that conference I told you about soon, we'll resume your training plan afterwards. Ok?" Misato called after her, apparently trying to be conciliatory.  
"我很快要去那个跟你提过的会议，之后再继续你的训练计划。好吗？" 美里在她身后喊道，显然是想缓和气氛。

_You never will. Why would you.  
你永远不会。你为什么要呢。_

Ω

Asuka pumped her arms and legs in a dead sprint as she rounded her final lap around the track. The muscles in her legs, previously burning, were now screaming at her in protest. Her lungs, seemingly in solidarity with the rest of her depleted and aching frame, were difficult to convince that the steady pace the pilot was forcing them to expand and contract was supplying her with sufficient oxygen. The exertion and the determination to finish strong were more than enough to keep Asuka distracted.  
明日香全力摆动双臂和双腿，在跑道上进行最后一圈的冲刺。她腿部原本灼热的肌肉，此刻正痛苦地抗议着。她的肺部，似乎与她疲惫不堪的身体同仇敌忾，难以说服自己以稳定的节奏扩张和收缩，正为她提供足够的氧气。这种努力和决心，足以让明日香分心，让她无暇他顾。

It would have continued to distract her if she were not suddenly confronted by an intruder in her space. The First Child, wearing her customary school uniform, had entered the room and positioned herself at the edge of the track sometime during the Second Child's previous lap while her back was to the door. Asuka closed her eyes and pushed herself even harder, blowing past her finish line without even looking at the time.  
如果不是突然有个闯入者出现在她的空间里，这种分心本会继续下去。第一适格者，穿着她惯常的校服，在第二适格者上一圈背对门口时，悄然进入了房间，并站在跑道边缘。明日香闭上眼睛，更加拼命地冲刺，没有看时间就冲过了终点线。

As she continued to circle around the track she slowed to a light jog and opened her eyes. She tried to focus on her body rather than the other girl. _In, two, three,_ she counted each step as she inhaled, posture picture perfect to allow for maximum efficiency, _out, two, three, four_, she counted as she exhaled. Her chest was attempting to heave after her extreme exertion, desperate for oxygen to supply her anaerobic muscles. The curve of the track betrayed her and brought the First back into view. She had taken a seat on a bench. The one Asuka's things were also resting on.  
随着她在跑道上继续绕圈，她逐渐放慢到轻松慢跑，睁开了双眼。她努力将注意力集中在自己身上，而非那位对手。吸气，二，三，她数着每一步，姿态完美无瑕，以确保最大效率；呼气，二，三，四，她数着呼气。经过剧烈运动后，她的胸膛急切地起伏，渴望氧气来供给无氧肌肉。跑道的弯道出卖了她，又将第一名的身影带入视野。她已坐在一张长椅上，那张椅子上还放着明日香的东西。

_This vacation is horrible. Can't she bother someone else?  
这假期真是糟透了。她就不能去烦别人吗？_

The loop returned its allegiance and Ayanami was behind Asuka, out of her view, once more. Her muscle groups she sometimes forgot existed ached as they struggled to shuffle her leaden legs along at the relatively unhurried, steady pace Asuka had slowed to for the end of her cooldown. Crossing the finish line once more saw her with heavy but easily controlled breathing and her eyes locked on to the white of the towel waiting for her on the bench, not the white of the First's exposed skin next to it.  
循环再次回归其忠诚，绫波零又一次出现在明日香身后，避开了她的视线。那些她有时会忘记存在的肌肉群，在努力拖动她沉重的双腿以适应明日香为结束冷却而放缓的稳定步伐时，感到酸痛。再次越过终点线时，她的呼吸虽沉重但易于控制，目光锁定在长椅上等待她的白色毛巾上，而非一旁第一适格者裸露肌肤的白色。

She snatched up the towel and brought it up to her face as quickly as she could only to wipe the sweat from her forehead, not bury her face. _Is there some sort of sign on my ass that says "annoying losers come talk to me" or are the First and Third just coincidentally always finding themselves alone around me._ Thus fortified, she lowered the towel and glared at her fellow pilot.  
她迅速抓起毛巾，尽可能快地将其举到脸上，只为擦拭额头上的汗水，而非埋住脸。是我的屁股上有什么标志写着“烦人的失败者来跟我说话”吗，还是第一和第三适格者只是碰巧总是独自出现在我周围。这样想着，她放下毛巾，瞪向她的同僚驾驶员。

_She's just been staring at me this whole time._ "You forget how to read a clock, First? Training doesn't start for three more hours." _Not that she's dressed for it. Oh, wait, Idiot Shinji probably forgot to order her to get changed first._  
她一直盯着我看。“你忘了怎么看钟了吗，First？训练还有三个小时才开始呢。”倒不是说她穿得适合训练。哦，等等，笨蛋真嗣大概忘了先命令她换衣服。

Rei, still staring, narrowed her eyes at Asuka. _At least they've been coming, though_, a very quiet part of her admitted before being seized and silenced. _Not that she even has a choice! Her_ Ikari-kun _probably tells her to come because he's too scared to come alone. And he only wants to come so he can stare at both of us, like I'm some doll! Coward!_  
丽依旧凝视着，眯起眼睛盯着明日香。至少他们一直在来，尽管她内心极小的一部分承认这一点后随即被压制和沉默。并非她有选择的余地！她的碇君大概是因为害怕独自前来，才告诉她一起来的。而他之所以想来，无非是想同时盯着我们俩，仿佛我是个玩偶似的！懦夫！

"I am not here to train." The pale girl appeared to have been pondering the question. "Captain Katsuragi asked me to inform you of recent events," Rei said with what Asuka swore was condescension.  
“我来此并非为了训练。”苍白的女孩似乎在思考这个问题。“葛城队长让我向你通报近期事态，”绫波说道，语气让明日香发誓听出了轻蔑。

"So you do whatever Misato says," Asuka said derisively. _Why bother with her, she's just a useless doll and nothing I can do will change that. I need to focus on more important things. Once Momma gets here Sh—_I _can do this without her._  
“所以你就对美里言听计从。”明日香嘲讽地说道。何必在意她呢，她不过是个无用的玩偶，我做什么都无法改变这一点。我得专注于更重要的事情。等妈妈来了，希——我可以不靠她做到的。

"I," Rei began but cut herself off with a frown. "Misato-san did not order me. She asked me. As I said."  
"我，" 丽开口道，却皱着眉打断了自己。"美里小姐并没有命令我。她是请求我。正如我所说。"

"Oh, it's _Misato-san_ now, is it? Asuka jeered, tossing her towel over her shoulder and moving to stand directly in front of Rei. "Live in her apartment for a while and now you're friends?"  
"哦，现在叫美里小姐了，是吗？"明日香嘲讽道，将毛巾甩到肩上，走到绫波面前。"在她公寓住了一阵子，你们就成了朋友？"

Shocking Asuka, Rei's eyes darted to the ground before she spoke again. "She has asked me to be less formal with her many times. The situation does not always merit it. It is difficult to determine what is appropriate." The barest hint of colour in her cheeks contrasted prettily with her blue hair. "Ikari-kun has been deployed in Unit 01 to apprehend a non-Angel threat," she said in what amounted to haste from the First Child.  
令明日香惊讶的是，绫波的目光迅速移向地面，然后再次开口。"她多次要求我与她不要那么正式。情况并非总是需要如此。很难判断什么是合适的。"她脸颊上那一抹几乎察觉不到的红晕，与她的蓝发形成鲜明对比，显得格外动人。"碇君已经驾驶初号机去应对一个非使徒的威胁，"第一适格者急忙说道。

"What did you say?!" Asuka demanded. _Deployed in Unit 01? But I'm right here!_  
“你说什么？！”明日香质问道。部署在 01 号机里？但我就在这儿啊！

"A mechanical weapon designed to fight Angels without the use of a living pilot has stopped following remote orders. The weapon is currently approaching a nearby city," Rei explained, able to meet Asuka's accusing stare.  
"一种旨在不使用活体驾驶员与天使作战的机械武器，现已停止遵循远程指令。该武器正向附近城市逼近。" 绫波解释道，迎上了明日香责备的目光。

"What? Some kind of robot, you mean?" _Someone said something, right?_ Rei nodded in response. "How would a robot fight an Angel? Everyone knows only an Evangelion can do that." _Why does this sound familiar?_  
“什么？你是说某种机器人吗？”有人说了什么，对吧？丽点头回应。“机器人怎么可能与使徒战斗？大家都知道只有 EVA 能做到。”为什么这话听起来这么耳熟？

"Those responsible for the weapon design did not consult me. I think, perhaps, they were more interested in building a human weapon rather than building something that could defeat an Angel."  
负责武器设计的人并未征询我的意见。我想，或许，他们更热衷于打造一件人类武器，而非制造出能击败天使的东西。

"Stop being so _literal_, Ayanami! Never mind, why is this crazy robot NERV's mess to clean up? What if he—err, one of us, or somebody got hurt trying to stop it?" _It's not like NERV had anything to do with their doll going nuts. It can't be important. That's why—that's why I don't remember._  
"别这么字面意思，绫波！算了，为什么这个疯狂的机器人要 NERV 来收拾残局？万一他——呃，我们中的谁，或者有人为了阻止它而受伤怎么办？又不是 NERV 让他们的玩偶发疯的。这事儿不重要。所以——所以我才不记得。"

"A nuclear reactor powers the machine. We have been told it will explode in one hour," Rei informed her.  
"核反应堆为这台机器提供动力。我们被告知它将在一小时内爆炸，" 丽向她报告。

"They sent Shinji out there?!" Asuka screeched, her jaw dropping slightly and her hands grabbing her hips in outrage. _When did—why is this happening? Why am I only just now finding out? What happened? I've been slacking off!_ "Who uses nuclear power in a combat system for a robot that can't beat an Angel?!"  
"他们把真嗣派出去了？！" 明日香尖叫道，下巴微张，双手愤怒地抓住自己的腰。什么时候——为什么会这样？为什么我现在才知道？发生了什么？我一直在偷懒！"谁会在一个连使徒都打不过的机器人战斗系统中使用核能？！"

"It is a human work," Rei replied simply. "Surely humans chose to use such a power system." Asuka was still debating whether she had been insulted when Rei stood from the bench. The corners of her mouth twitched upward the slightest bit, making it quite possibly the largest smile Asuka had ever seen from the First Child. _If she can make her face look that cute, why does she walk around like an emotionless doll all the time?_ "Captain Katsuragi believes she can disable it. Ikari-kun must simply prevent the machine from reaching its apparent goal long enough to allow her access to its generator."  
“这是人类的作品。”丽简单地回答，“人类当然会选择使用这样的能源系统。”明日香还在琢磨自己是否被冒犯了，这时丽从长椅上站了起来。她的嘴角微微上扬，这或许是明日香见过的第一适任者最大的笑容了。如果她能让自己的脸变得如此可爱，为什么她总是像个无情的玩偶一样四处走动呢？“葛城队长相信她能将其关闭。真嗣只需要阻止机器达成其明显目标，直到她能接触到它的发电机。”

Rei turned to leave. Asuka, now more confused than she had been before Ayanami had explained anything, stood still in Rei's minimal wake.  
丽转身离去。明日香此刻比绫波解释之前还要困惑，呆立在丽留下的微弱痕迹中。

"That was a joke, earlier." The confusing girl said as she stopped in the doorway, still facing away from Asuka. _It was?_ "About the time."  
“那是个玩笑，之前。”那位令人困惑的女孩在门口停下脚步，依旧背对着明日香说道。是吗？“关于时间的事。”

"You mean he has less?!" Asuka dropped her arms to hang at her sides.  
"你是说他更少？！" 明日香放下手臂，垂在身侧。

"You know I am capable of reading a clock, so you implied I was not. Not in error. In jest. Goodbye, Soryu."  
"你知道我能看懂时钟，所以你暗示我不行。不是错误，是开玩笑。再见，惣流。"

"Huh? Hey, wait!" _You—_"Fine!" Asuka _huffed_, stepping up and turning to sit on the bench. _Just go run off to_ Ikari-kun _and_ Misato-san _and tell them how much of a bitch the Second_ Child _was to you_. She grabbed her water bottle and squeezed it. _I'm not some kid they can just choose to inform about these things whenever it's convenient! And you send the First like she's my nanny!_  
"嗯？嘿，等等！你——"好！" 明日香气呼呼地走上前，转身坐在长椅上。尽管去真嗣和美里那里告状，告诉他们二号机驾驶员对你有多刻薄。她抓起水瓶，用力挤压。我不是他们可以随意选择何时告知这些事情的小孩！你还派一号机驾驶员来，好像她是我的保姆一样！

She hefted the hand holding the water bottle behind her and chucked the bottle across the track as hard as she could. "Why did they want _Shinji_! I'm right _here_!" _Focus. You have to work harder,_ Asuka chided herself as she watched the container hit the ground and slide across the floor. _Show them the Great Asuka Langley Soryu!_  
她将握着水瓶的手甩到身后，用尽全力将瓶子扔向赛道。“为什么他们要找真嗣！我就在这儿！”集中精神。你必须更加努力，明日香自责地看着水瓶落地并滑过地板。让他们见识见识伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷！

Asuka shivered as the cool breeze of the Geofront's climate control system blew over her, reminding her how soaked with sweat her running clothes were. _I need to make sure their meals have enough salt; has he been accounting for getting out of the simulator?_  
明日香在 Geofront 的气候控制系统带来的凉风中打了个寒颤，这让她意识到自己的运动服已被汗水浸透。我得确保他们的饭菜里有足够的盐分；他有没有考虑到从模拟器中出来的情况？

Ω

"There you are, Asuka." The mentioned girl looked up from her screen to glance quickly over her shoulder. Unexpectedly, her ears had not lied to her. _Kaji? I haven't seen you in ages._ Her surprised expression shifted to an angry one. _Not that I wanted to anyway!_  
“你在这儿啊，明日香。”被提到的女孩从屏幕上抬起头，迅速回头瞥了一眼。出乎意料，她的耳朵并没有欺骗她。加持？我好久没见到你了。她惊讶的表情转瞬变为愤怒。不过我也没想见你！

"What do you want, Kaji." Asuka said irritably. She turned back to her work and watched streams of data flow across her screen. _Who programmed this garbage? Why is the maximum number of hostile Angels limited to nine?_  
“你想要什么，加持。”明日香不耐烦地说道。她转回工作，盯着屏幕上流动的数据。这是谁编的垃圾程序？为什么敌对使徒的数量上限只有九个？

"I may have deserved that," Kaji said sagely. "I'm sorry if it seems like I've abandoned you, kiddo. We just haven't had any chances to speak." Asuka's shoulders hunched at the reminder of her place in his view. She heard him walk up behind her and felt his hand hover millimeters over her head. A very faint rush of air as he reconsidered his decision and pulled his hand away caused a few stray hairs to tickle Asuka's neck.  
"我或许活该如此，"加持睿智地说道，"如果让你觉得我抛弃了你，我很抱歉，孩子。只是我们一直没有机会交谈。" 听到这话，明日香的肩膀不由自主地缩了起来，意识到自己在加持眼中的位置。她感觉到他走到了她身后，一只手悬停在离她头顶仅几毫米的地方。当他重新考虑并收回手的瞬间，微弱的气流拂过，几缕散落的头发轻挠着明日香的脖颈。

_You can't abandon someone you were never there for to begin with_. _Get back to work._ Asuka reminded herself of disheveled suits and perfume. Of outrage and covering for _her._ But the man's place in her heart was too secure, and his apparent attempt at reconciliation too sorely desired, for him to be ignored so easily. "It's ok, I know you've been busy," she answered, dejected, with a deep sigh. She turned off her screen, no longer interested in the calculations and predictions she had asked the Magi to work on and spun around slowly to face Kaji directly. She tried to offer him the bright smile she normally displayed just for him but could not muster even the fake cheer necessary.  
你无法抛弃一个你从未真正陪伴过的人。回到工作上来吧。明日香回想起凌乱的西装和香水味，愤怒与为她掩饰的情景。但他在她心中的位置太过牢固，而他明显试图和解的举动又太过渴望，以至于无法轻易忽视。“没关系，我知道你一直很忙。”她沮丧地回答，深深叹了口气。她关掉屏幕，不再关心她让 MAGI 进行的计算和预测，缓缓转身直面加持。她试图给他一个平时只为他展露的灿烂笑容，却连勉强的欢颜都难以维持。

She wanted—well, there were a great many things she wanted. "Did you come to see me?" She asked, a note of hope sneaking its way into her voice despite her somewhat mixed feelings towards her still-technically guardian. _I shouldn't, but—well, I'm on vacation. I just want a break. A small one. With a real man._  
她想要的——嗯，有很多很多东西她都想要。“你是来看我的吗？”她问道，尽管对这位名义上的监护人感情复杂，声音中仍不自觉地流露出一丝期待。我不该，但是——嗯，我在度假。我只想休息一下。小小的。和一个真正的男人一起。

"I sure did," Kaji replied, that familiar troublesome smile placed on his stubbled, roguish face. _He always did look so handsome._ "What do you say we get out of here? There's something I've been meaning to show you for a while now."  
"当然去了，" 加持回答道，那熟悉的令人头疼的微笑挂在他那胡茬满布、不羁的脸上。他总是显得那么英俊。"我们何不离开这里？有件事我早就想带你去看，已经有一段时间了。"

Asuka felt her pulse quicken and barely registered the words he had spoken after confirming the purpose of his visit. "Really?" She asked, and she hated how deprived she sounded, hated as her face began to turn red. _Stupid little girl. Everyone already thinks you're just some immature child, the lovesick schoolgirl routine isn't helping! I should just get back to work. But he came to see me!_ Excitement prickled Asuka's skin.  
明日香感到心跳加速，几乎没注意到他确认来访目的后说的话。"真的吗？" 她问道，讨厌自己听起来多么渴望，讨厌自己的脸开始变红。愚蠢的小女孩。大家都已经认为你只是个不成熟的孩子，这种相思病少女的戏码毫无帮助！我应该回去工作。但他来看我了！兴奋感刺痛了明日香的肌肤。

"Yup. Come on, Asuka," he said, indicating for her to stand and follow him. He followed the gesture with a wink and Asuka felt her resistance melting away. _This is a how a real man asks a woman for a date._  
"是的。来吧，明日香，" 他说着，示意她站起来跟他走。他随后眨了眨眼，明日香感到自己的抗拒正在消融。这才是一个真正的男人邀请女人约会的样子。

"But I've got to get changed," Asuka frowned as she rose. She tugged at the tan fabric of the NERV uniform blouse she was wearing as she walked toward Kaji, who had turned to begin exiting the deserted bridge. _I can't go on a date dressed like this!_  
"但我得换身衣服，"明日香皱着眉站起身。她一边走向已经转身准备离开空荡荡的指挥室的加持，一边拉扯着身上 NERV 制服衬衫的棕褐色布料。我总不能就这样去约会吧！

"Is that so?" Kaji asked lightly as Asuka struggled to match her pace to his after almost running to catch up with him. He draped an arm over her shoulder with such casualness that it made even Asuka almost forget how reluctant he had always been, will be, _is,_ to make such gestures. _What's going on? I—_Asuka's blush managed to deepen, and she failed to stop a contented smile from breaking out on her face before Kaji looked down to her and smiled back. "Because someone _I_ know said you never look anything less than beautiful no matter what you're wearing. I could be paraphrasing, but I'm sure you know best. Did you want to stop by your quarters?"  
“是吗？”加持轻描淡写地问道，而明日香则努力调整步伐跟上他，几乎是一路小跑才追上。他随意地将手臂搭在她的肩上，这种自然而然的亲昵让明日香几乎忘记了加持一直以来是多么不情愿做出这样的举动。这是怎么回事？我——明日香的脸颊不由得更红了，她没能抑制住嘴角满意的微笑，而加持低头看向她，也回以微笑。“因为一个我认识的人说，无论你穿什么，看起来都绝不会不美。我可能是在转述，但我想你最清楚不过了。你想回房间一趟吗？”

Asuka squeezed her eyes shut and rested her head against Kaji's shoulder. _He never said—has something happened?_ "No, thank you, Kaji," she mumbled, too confused and too caught up in disbelief to detest how timid her voice sounded. Any thought of returning to her room to change was no longer welcome near her. _He thinks I'm beautiful. He always has?_ _No, I need to focus. This is just a little break._ She tried to remember the smell of lavender.  
明日香闭上眼睛，将头靠在加持的肩膀上。他从未说过——是发生了什么事吗？“不了，谢谢你，加持。”她咕哝着，太过困惑和难以置信，以至于对自己的怯懦声音感到厌恶。任何回房间换衣服的想法此刻都不再受欢迎。他认为我美。他一直这么认为吗？不，我需要集中注意力。这只是一个小小的休息。她试图回忆薰衣草的香气。

"I mean, of course the Great Asuka Langley Soryu can make any outfit look great!" She said forcefully. Memories of a man's jacket covering her shoulders and a man's voice telling her to go to bed were losing ground, banished by _his_ arm covering her shoulders, _his_ voice calling her beautiful.  
“我是说，当然啦，伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷穿什么都好看！”她坚定地说道。记忆中男人的外套披在肩头，男人的声音催她去睡觉的画面逐渐淡去，取而代之的是他揽住她肩膀的手臂，他唤她美丽的声音。

_Don't get carried away. You're indulging in some harmless fun; you know you can't really have this. Remember what he thinks of you. Even if he calls it a date, he'll only ever care about_ her. She took advantage of the position of her head to examine the scent of his shirt as they entered an elevator. _Cologne, detergent from the NERV laundry facilities, cigarettes. Not lavender. Not today, not yet. Or could this really be just for me?_  
别得意忘形了。你只是在享受一些无害的乐趣；你知道这终究不属于你。记住他对你的看法。即便他称之为约会，他的心思也只会放在她身上。她趁他低头之际，在步入电梯时细细嗅了嗅他衬衫上的气味。古龙水，NERV 洗衣房的洗涤剂，还有烟味。不是薰衣草。今天还不是，尚未。或者，这真的只是为我一人？

"Where are we going?" Asuka asked. Kaji's arm drifted off of her shoulder for him to press the button for their destination and did not return to its perch. It was almost upsetting to her how pleased she was with what was missing.  
“我们去哪儿？”明日香问道。加持的手臂从她肩上滑落，按下了目的地的按钮，却没有再搭回去。她几乎为这份缺失感到心烦意乱，却又暗自欣喜。

"Oh, just a little place I have in mind," Kaji answered evasively.  
"哦，只是我心里有个小地方，" 加持含糊其辞地回答道。

She wanted to be concerned with the way he kept adjusting his loose tie. She wanted to be held closer. She wanted to return to the work. She wanted her mother. She wanted to be wanted. She wanted to know why he kept looking at his watch. She wanted to be complemented again. She wanted him to tell her where they were going.  
她想要关心他不断调整松散领带的方式。她想要被抱得更紧。她想要回到工作中。她想要她的母亲。她想要被需要。她想要知道他为什么不停地看手表。她想要再次被赞美。她想要他告诉她他们要去哪里。

"A restaurant?" Asuka asked, not quite dolefully. _He never treats eating together like a date. As if I would waste time eating with any boy I wouldn't date! But a meal is good. You have more important things to do than play pretend, Soryu. He still thinks I'm some kind of kid but at least I can get back to the work more quickly._ She swallowed a yawn.  
"餐厅？" 明日香问道，语气中略带一丝不满。他从未把一起吃饭当作约会。好像我会浪费时间与任何一个我不想约会的男孩共进晚餐似的！不过，吃饭也不错。你有更重要的事情要做，而不是玩假装游戏，惣流。他仍把我当孩子看待，但至少我能更快回到工作中。她咽下了一个哈欠。

"No," Kaji said coyly after letting her question hang in the air for a few moments. He did not elaborate as he led her out of the elevator and through a series of gates, checkpoints, and security fences. She was too focused on determining the implications of his _no_ to notice as they emerged into the broad, open expanse of the Geofront's artificially maintained nature preserve. _So is he serious about this?! I—I don't know what's going on! This didn't happen! A_ real _date with Kaji?_  
"不，" 加持狡黠地说道，让她的疑问在空气中悬停了几秒钟。他没有进一步解释，而是带着她走出电梯，穿过一系列的闸门、检查站和安全围栏。她过于专注于揣摩他那句“不”的含义，以至于当他们步入广阔开阔的 Geofront 人工维护的自然保护区时，她并未注意到周围的景象。所以他这是认真的吗？！我——我不知道发生了什么！这从未发生过！与加持真正的约会？

"Where, then?" Asuka questioned him, trying her best to wear a flirtatious pout, hoping she did not sound petulant. "It's rude to keep a lady waiting in suspense, you know."  
"那到底在哪里？" 明日香向他发问，尽力摆出一个撩人的噘嘴，希望自己听起来不那么任性。"让女士悬着心等待可是不礼貌的，你知道的。"

"You'll find out soon," Kaji assured her. Asuka suppressed a growl and separated the smallest amount from his side, lifting her head to finally take stock of her surroundings. She made sure to keep her arm at least loosely wrapped around Kaji. _Wait, outside? No, still in the Geofront._ The ground beneath her had at some point in their journey transitioned from hard pavement to soft grass. _Where could he possibly have in mind?_  
"你很快就会知道了，" 加持向她保证。明日香忍住一声低吼，稍稍从他身边挪开一点，抬起头来终于开始打量四周。她确保自己的手臂至少还松松地搭在加持身上。等等，在外面？不，还是在地底都市。脚下的地面不知何时已从坚硬的路面变成了柔软的草地。他究竟打算带她去哪儿呢？

She glanced up at the huge, domed ceiling of the Geofront as Kaji led them towards a small dirt trail that meandered around a copse of trees. The lack of a visible sky did nothing to prevent her throat from constricting and tension to build in her muscles. _No, no, not now!_ Asuka tried to fight the rising feeling of panic that was attempting to settle over her. _It's just nerves, that's it! I'm on a date with Kaji and I'm a little nervous!_  
她抬头望向 Geofront 那巨大的穹顶，Kaji 正领着她走向一条蜿蜒穿过小树林的泥土小径。尽管看不见天空，她的喉咙却莫名紧缩，肌肉也逐渐绷紧。不，不，现在不行！明日香努力抵抗着那股试图笼罩她的恐慌感。只是紧张而已，没错！我和 Kaji 在约会，有点紧张很正常！

"Are we almost there?" Asuka asked around her partially clenched teeth, trying to sound curious rather than on edge. Asuka listened to the sounds of their feet against the muffling dirt of the path, the faint rustling of fabric as their clothes moved with them, the wind rustling through trees. She did not hear sickening groans, snapping bones, and gnashing teeth. She smelled sap, damp earth, and crushed grass. Not blood. Not lavender. She swallowed, and there was no LCL in her mouth. She buried her face back into Kaji's shoulder and hugged him tightly. _I'm fine. I'm with Kaji and I'm fine. He'll help me. I just needed—_need_! Not needed—I need to relax. That's the help I meant. I didn't need anyone._  
"我们快到了吗？" 明日香咬着牙问道，努力显得好奇而非紧张。她聆听着他们的脚步踏在掩盖声音的泥土小径上，衣物随着动作轻微摩擦的沙沙声，以及风穿过树木的沙沙声。她没有听到令人作呕的呻吟、骨头断裂和牙齿咬合的声音。她闻到的是树脂、湿润的泥土和压碎的草香。没有血腥味，也没有薰衣草香。她咽了咽口水，嘴里没有 LCL 液体。她将脸埋回加持的肩膀，紧紧抱住他。我没事。我和加持在一起，我很好。他会帮我的。我只是需要——需要！不是曾经需要——我现在需要放松。那才是我所说的帮助。我不需要任何人。

"Almost," Kaji answered with a hum. He was seemingly unperturbed by Asuka's clinginess, only glancing down to check his watch again from time to time. _Nothing bad is happening._ Asuka no longer needed to struggle to keep her breathing calm. Thoughts of lolling red tongues and grasping fingers like terrible hooked claws were assuaged by the care she was shown from a man that would always be important to her. _I'm just excited because this is my first real date. With a real man. And maybe I've been focusing too much on the work so I'm more excited than normal._  
“差不多了。”加持应道，语气中带着一丝哼鸣。他似乎对明日香的热情黏人毫不在意，只是偶尔低头查看手表。一切并无不妥。明日香不再需要努力平复呼吸。那些关于猩红舌头和如恐怖钩爪般抓握的手指的念头，在一位对她始终重要的男人所给予的关怀下得到了抚慰。我只是因为这是我的第一次真正约会而兴奋。和一个真正的男人。或许是因为我过于专注于工作，所以比平时更加激动。

"We're here," Kaji said fondly. Asuka looked up—certainly not hesitantly—to a small shack at the end of the trail standing rather forlornly next to a patch of weedy, disturbed earth.  
“我们到了。”加持温柔地说道。明日香抬头望去——当然毫不犹豫——只见小径尽头有一间破旧的小屋，孤零零地立在一片杂草丛生、翻动过的土地旁。

"Huh?" She asked, her panic mostly gone. In its stead was the jittery, familiar pre-fight excitement and nothing good to use it for. That, and confusion. She raised an eyebrow at what she had taken to be a muddy spot of weeds, finally realizing they were growing uniformly in neat rows. _Seedlings?_  
"啊？" 她问道，恐慌已大部分消退。取而代之的是那种熟悉的、战前紧张的兴奋感，却找不到什么好事来发泄。还有困惑。她对那片她以为是泥泞杂草的地方扬起眉毛，终于意识到它们整齐地排列成行。是幼苗吗？

"This is my little get-away," Kaji finally answered. He disentangled himself from Asuka, who suddenly felt adrift without his warmth and closeness to anchor her. _I—_  
"这是我小小的避风港，" 加持终于回答道。他从明日香身边挣脱出来，她突然感到失去了他的温暖和亲近作为依靠，有些无所适从。我——

"It isn't much to look at yet," he continued as he stepped away from Asuka. She tried to focus on his words, the way he walked, the sound of his voice. _This is still a date. Nothing is wrong._

"But to me," Kaji said as he squatted at the edge of the dark dirt, leaving Asuka to stand alone, "it's a beautiful garden." He reached down to take a small handful of soil and work it between his fingers. "My own little watermelon patch." Asuka was too focused on his speaking to listen to what he had to say. It took the rest of her concentration to walk the few steps separating them and kneel on the ground next to him. She leaned into him and felt her heart settle. _A little fun time. Just for me. That's what this is. I don't need him. I don't need help. It's just nice to relax once in a while._  
"但对我来说，"加持蹲在黑暗的泥土边缘说道，留下明日香独自站立，"这是一个美丽的花园。"他伸手抓起一小把土壤，在指间揉搓。"我自己的小西瓜地。"明日香太过专注于他的话语，以至于没怎么听进去。她费了剩下的全部注意力，才走完那几步隔开他们的距离，跪在他旁边的地上。她靠向他，感到心安定了下来。一段小小的欢乐时光。只属于我。就是这样。我不需要他。我不需要帮助。只是偶尔放松一下，感觉很好。

Kaji stood, careful to watch for Asuka's balance as she lowered one hand to the ground to steady herself. Now that she was closer, the smell of the damp soil became more prominent than the lack of lavender perfume. A hand rested on her shoulder. His hand was strong and big, as a _man's_ hand should be. Not as _other_ hands were. She could almost feel the adrenaline filtering out of her system, the wind swept from her sails.  
加持站着，小心翼翼地注意着明日香平衡的姿态，她将一只手伸向地面以稳住自己。现在她更近了，潮湿土壤的气味变得比缺乏薰衣草香水更为突出。一只手搭在她的肩上。他的手强壮而宽大，正是一个男人的手应有的样子。不像其他的手。她几乎能感觉到肾上腺素从体内消退，风也从她的帆上吹过。

"I know it might sound silly, Asuka," Kaji said gently to the open air above her head. "But these plants depend on me."  
“我知道这听起来可能很傻，明日香，”加持温柔地对着她头顶的空旷说道，“但这些植物依赖着我。”

_Who cares about some stupid melons? This is supposed to be a date!_ She almost snapped out. Instead, she tightened one hand around a fistful of dirt. It did not resist her efforts, compressing easily into packed earth. No creaking or cracking accompanied it's change of shape, no red glow shone from between her fingers. "Is this what you do all day?" She asked evenly. She was kneeling at the edge of plot of disturbed earth. There was nothing to merit any sort of panic. _A date with Kaji. That's exciting._ She dropped the dirt and turned to look at Kaji, but the smile she showed him failed to reach her eyes. She felt so tired.  
谁在乎那些愚蠢的瓜呢？这应该是约会才对！她几乎要爆发了。相反，她紧握一把泥土，泥土在她手中轻易地压缩成坚实的土块，没有吱吱作响，也没有裂缝，更没有红光从指间透出。“你整天都在做这个吗？”她平静地问道。她跪在一片翻动过的土地边缘，没有任何值得惊慌的事情。与加持约会，这应该很令人兴奋。她松开泥土，转身看向加持，但展露给他的笑容并未触及她的眼底。她感到如此疲惫。

"Sometimes it feels like I spend all day working but no one notices."  
“有时候感觉我整天都在工作，却没人注意到。”

_What's that supposed to mean? I know you've got at least_ some _responsibilities as a UN Inspector. Not to mention all the gag-worthy "flirting with anything in a skirt" which you know I hate. You can't just dig around in the dirt all day._ "But you enjoy it?" Asuka asked, trying to keep the conversation going as she struggled against fatigue to think of a way to steer the occasion back to a date.  
那是什么意思？我知道你作为联合国调查员至少有些职责。更别提那些让我反感的、对穿裙子的任何人都调情的行为了。你不能整天就在土里挖来挖去。“但你喜欢这样吗？”明日香问道，努力维持对话，同时挣扎着对抗疲劳，试图找到将这次会面引回约会轨道的方法。

"It may not always feel like it, but there's nothing in the world I'd rather be doing." Kaji squeezed her shoulder affectionately. Asuka's smile finally met her eyes, even if his stare was focused somewhere only he could see. _See? Everything is fine. I'm on a date with Kaji!_  
"或许并不总是感觉如此，但世界上没有什么比这更让我想做的事了。" 加持温柔地捏了捏她的肩膀。明日香的微笑终于触及了她的眼眸，尽管他的目光聚焦在只有他自己能看到的地方。看吧？一切都很好。我和加持在约会呢！

"Well, _I_ notice, Kaji," Asuka said happily, stifling a yawn. She reached a hand up to place it on his, but he drew the hand away just before her fingertips were able to brush against his. Asuka tried not to let Kaji notice her flinch as he checked his watch.  
“嗯，我注意到了，加持先生。”明日香愉快地说道，强忍住一个哈欠。她伸出手想要放在他的手上，但就在她的指尖即将触碰到他之前，他抽回了手。明日香努力不让加持注意到她的退缩，因为他正在查看手表。

"Thank you, Asuka," he said, though Asuka was confused by the sadness she heard. _Did I say something wrong? Should I have waited? Kaji, I'm too tired for games._ The Walls of Jericho, waking up in a bed, alone. Games she had lost _before_.  
"谢谢你，明日香，" 他说道，尽管明日香因听到的悲伤而感到困惑。我说错什么了吗？我应该等一等吗？加持，我太累了，不想玩游戏。耶利哥的城墙，醒来时独自一人躺在床上。那些她早已输掉的游戏。

"Kaji," she said slowly as she stood, not even giving him time to step away before she had an arm around his waist. Her plan was forming. "What time is it?" _Too tired to walk home after training._  
"加持，" 她缓缓地说着站起身来，甚至没给他时间退开，她的手臂已经环住了他的腰。她的计划正在成型。"现在几点了？" 训练后累得走不回去了。

"Not quite 1930," He answered with a frown. Asuka ignored how he had only pretended to glance at his watch. _Look at me!_ "Bored of my work already?" Kaji asked with a soft chuckle.  
"还没到 1930 年呢。"他皱着眉回答。明日香无视了他只是假装瞥了一眼手表的事实。看着我！"已经对我的工作感到厌倦了吗？"加持轻笑着问道。

"No, it's wonderful," she lied. _Just like old times. Remember?_ "But I'm _so_ tired, I don't think _someone's_ vacation idea has helped at all." _If Misato hadn't ordered this_ time off _Idiot Shinji wouldn't have been the one to fight that Jet Whatever. No one would have been able to overlook me if I were working like normal._  
"不，这太美妙了，"她撒谎道。就像往常一样。记得吗？"但我实在太累了，我觉得某人的度假计划一点帮助都没有。"如果不是美里命令这次休假，笨蛋真嗣就不会是那个去对抗那架喷气式什么的了。如果我像平常一样工作，没人会忽视我。

"Can't you stay up a bit later, Asuka?" Kaji asked as he _finally_ put his arm back around her shoulder. _Oh! Well, I—he means here? But he should take me home—_Asuka blushed deeply as her plan raced off out of her control. _I don't think I want to spend the night with him_ out here_._ She steadied herself with one hand against his chest, leaning into him.  
"你不能再晚点睡吗，明日香？" 终于，加持将手臂重新搭在她的肩上问道。哦！好吧，我——他是说在这里吗？但他应该送我回家——明日香的脸颊深红，计划完全脱离了她的控制。我不认为我想和他在这里过夜。她一手撑在他的胸前，靠向他稳住自己。

"If I'm with you, I don't mind," Asuka said softly as she rested her head on his breast. _Just as long as I'm with you._ Thoughts of the Walls of Jericho crumbled.  
"只要和你在一起，我就不介意。"明日香轻声说道，将头靠在他的胸膛上。只要能和你在一起，耶利哥城墙般的隔阂也烟消云散了。

"Good," he answered, using the arm he had placed on her shoulder to take her arm off his chest. Asuka was about to protest until he pulled away entirely with a gentle "Wait right here, Asuka, let me grab something." He walked into the shed and Asuka yawned widely as she did as he asked.  
“好。”他应道，用搭在她肩上的手臂轻轻移开她环在他胸前的手。明日香正要抗议，他却温柔地说了句“在这里等我，明日香，我去拿点东西。”便走进了小屋。明日香依言打了个大大的哈欠，站在原地等待。

He returned quickly to offer a small collapsable camp chair, unfolding it and placing it beside Asuka. He offered his hand as Asuka raised an eyebrow.  
他迅速返回，递给明日香一把可折叠的小型露营椅，展开后放在她旁边。当明日香挑起眉毛时，他伸出了手。

She took the offered hand, and he gently led her to sit on the chair. "But where will _you_ sit, Kaji?"  
她接过他的手，他温柔地引导她坐下。“但你坐哪儿呢，加持？”

"I won't need one," he answered with a grin as he dropped her hand. She had not figured out what he had meant before he was already seated on the ground next to her, the height of the chair bringing her shoulder up to his head level. "So you were saying your vacation isn't going well?"  
“我不需要椅子，”他笑着回答，同时松开了她的手。她还没弄明白他的意思，他已经坐在她旁边的地上，椅子的高度使她的肩膀刚好与他头部齐平。“所以你说你的假期过得不太好？”

_What a gentleman. He takes care of me, and he listens!_ "Oh, it's just _awful_, Kaji," Asuka stifled the compulsion to call him _Ryoji_. _That would be too far, right?_ "Misato shuffles me off out of the way and suddenly it's always the Third Child who they need, as if _he_ were any better than _me_."  
真是个绅士。他照顾我，还倾听我说话！“哦，真是糟糕透顶，加持，”明日香强忍着不叫他“良治”的冲动。那样做太过分了吧？“美里总是把我支开，然后突然间他们总是需要那个第三适格者，好像他比我强多少似的。”

"It can be frustrating when it feels like no one else understands how hard you work. It can feel like no one sees you. Or, at least, they don't see you the way you want to be seen." _You_ do _understand! I've missed you, Kaji._ "But different people have their own ways of doing things. Just because you don't understand what someone is doing doesn't mean they aren't trying to help."  
"当你觉得似乎没人理解你有多努力时，那种感觉确实令人沮丧。仿佛没人看见你，或者至少，他们没有以你希望的方式看见你。" 你懂的！我想你了，Kaji。"但每个人都有自己的行事方式。你不理解某人的所作所为，并不意味着他们不是在努力帮忙。"

"I guess, maybe," Asuka said as she wished she could rest her head on his shoulder. Her neck was starting to prove incapable of the burden. "But enough about that," she said, wishing she had an angle to grab onto his arm from where she was sitting that would not be too awkward. "I'm still pretty tired, Kaji," she murmured, trying to pitch her voice down the way she had heard Misa—other women do.  
"我想，或许吧，" 明日香说道，她真希望能把头靠在他的肩上。她的脖子开始证明自己承受不了这个负担。"不过，别再提那个了，" 她说，希望自己能找到一个不那么尴尬的角度去抓住他的手臂，从她坐的位置来看。"我还是挺累的，加持，" 她低声说，试图模仿她听过的美里——以及其他女人的那种语调。

Kaji glanced up, a slightly concerned frown on his face. "Really? Are you feeling ok, Asuka?" He stood and glanced at his watch again as Asuka felt the Walls of Jericho rebuilding faster than they had fallen.  
加持抬头看了看，脸上带着一丝关切的皱眉。"真的吗？你感觉还好吗，明日香？" 他站起身，再次看了看手表，而明日香感觉到耶利哥之墙正在以比倒塌时更快的速度重建。

"I'm fine!" She rushed out. "I just, well, I've missed you, Kaji," she tried to start again. "Remember when you used to carry me home?" _You understand, right? You'll bring me home, like a real man?_  
"我很好！" 她急忙说道，"我只是，嗯，我有点想你了，加持。" 她试图重新开始，"记得你以前经常背我回家吗？你懂的，对吧？你会像个真正的男人一样带我回家，对吗？

"Well, it's still not very late, but maybe I should see you home," Kaji said, once again offering his hand to Asuka. _Oh, much better._ He helped her stand before grabbing the chair and folding it back up. Asuka watched him walk to the shed and bit her bottom lip. _This is working. Good._  
"嗯，时间还不算太晚，但也许我应该送你回家，" 加持说，再次向明日香伸出手。哦，好多了。他帮她站起身，然后拿起椅子折叠好。明日香看着他走向棚屋，咬了咬下唇。这招奏效了。很好。

She moved to start walking with him when he came back out of the shed, but he stopped her with a kind gesture and spun around so his back faced her, then took a knee. "Hop on, Asuka," he said, glancing over his shoulder. "I know you work hard. You really do deserve a break. Just like old times?"  
当加持从棚屋出来时，她本想和他一起走，但他用一个温柔的动作阻止了她，转过身背对着她，然后单膝跪下。"跳上来吧，明日香，" 他回头说道，"我知道你工作很辛苦。你真的值得休息一下。就像过去那样？

Asuka blinked rapidly, her eyes hot, as she placed her arms over his shoulders and lifted her legs to wrap them around his waist as he stood. His hands hovered gingerly just below her legs, forcing Asuka to do most of the work in keeping herself aloft. But the gentle swaying of his gait, combined with her exhaustion, still found her drifting off as Kaji carried her back into the NERV headquarters.  
明日香快速眨眼，眼中热意涌动，她将双臂搭在他的肩上，抬起双腿缠绕在他的腰间，而他站立着。他的双手小心翼翼地悬停在她腿下，迫使明日香自己承担起大部分保持身体悬空的工作。但他的步伐轻柔摇摆，加之她的疲惫，仍让她在加持将她带回 NERV 总部的途中渐渐陷入沉睡。

"You know, it's good to have something to do, even when you're on vacation." Asuka liked hearing his voice reassure her, she could even feel it in her arms and chest from where she held herself close to him. "But it's better to do something that's not just more work. Maybe you could spend some time out here, instead." Asuka imagined eating meals together, walking together, sitting in the living room together, staring at his lips inches away from her face as they stand together in the kitchen.  
"你知道吗，有事情做总是好的，即便是在度假的时候。" 听着他的声音安抚她，明日香甚至能从紧贴着他的怀抱中感受到那份安心。"但最好是做些不仅仅是更多工作的事情。或许你可以花些时间在这儿，而不是那样。" 明日香想象着一起用餐，一起散步，一起坐在客厅里，站在厨房时凝视着他近在咫尺的唇。

Some annoying voice was yelling, interrupting her peace. She repositioned her arms, accidentally brushing against his cheek and felt, bizarrely, stubble. "You need to shave," she mumbled, already falling back to sleep.  
某个烦人的声音在大喊大叫，打破了她的宁静。她调整了一下手臂的位置，不经意间擦过了他的脸颊，奇怪地感觉到了胡茬。“你该刮胡子了。”她咕哝着，又沉沉睡去。

An odd rumble in her chest, seemingly in response to that annoying voice yelling something, again. "No, wait, it was your breath that tickled," she slurred. _I held your nose, you hated me so much you wouldn't even hold my hand to stop me._  
"胸腔里传来一阵奇怪的震动，似乎是对那烦人的声音再次喊叫的回应。“不，等等，是你的呼吸在挠痒，”她含糊地说。我捏住了你的鼻子，你那么讨厌我，甚至都不愿意握住我的手阻止我。”

She woke slowly to a voice she had been avoiding for days.  
她缓缓醒来，耳边是那个她已躲避多日的声音。

"You brought her _here_?!" Misato yelled.  
"你把她带到这里来了？！" 美里喊道。

"Kaji?" Asuka asked with a yawn. She blinked leisurely as she lifted her head from his shoulder. Still too groggy to be embarrassed by the wet patch of drool she had left on her impromptu pillow, even the patches that were closer to his collar than her mouth had been.  
"加持？"明日香打着哈欠问道。她慵懒地眨着眼，从他的肩头抬起头来。尽管口水印离他的衣领比她的嘴更近，她仍困得没意识到自己留下的湿漉漉痕迹，更别提感到尴尬了。

"She's exhausted, Katsuragi. Who's bed should I carry her to? Mine? She's a _child_. I'm bringing her home, like I should." He answered defensively.  
“她累坏了，桂。我该把她抱到谁的床上？我的？她还是个孩子。我应该把她带回家。”他带着防备地回答。

"What's going on? You brought me home, right, Kaji?" Asuka asked, tightening her legs back up around his waist. When had she loosened them? _How long has it been?_  
"怎么回事？是你带我回家的，对吧，加持？" 明日香问道，再次收紧双腿环绕在他的腰间。她什么时候松开的？已经过去多久了？

"You _knew_ I had something planned, you horrible man!" Misato sulked angrily.  
"你明明知道我有安排的，你这个讨厌的男人！" 美里生气地抱怨道。

"Really, Katsuragi, she wasn't feeling well." Kaji said softly, the vibrations rumbling comfortably against Asuka's chest. _What?_  
“真的，葛城，她身体不舒服。”加持轻声说道，声音在明日香胸前引起一阵舒适的震动。什么？

"But I'm fine, Kaji," Asuka said, rubbing one eye with a loosely clenched hand. The untended eye was no longer drooping closed. _I have to be fine, you're supposed to come inside with me. We were just in the kitchen, though, right? Or was it the living room? What's going on?_ "Why is she interrupting our date?"  
"但我没事，加持," 明日香说道，用松松握着的拳头揉了揉一只眼睛。那只未被照顾的眼睛不再下垂闭合。我必须没事，你应该跟我进来的。我们刚才是在厨房，对吧？还是客厅？到底怎么回事？"为什么她要打断我们的约会？"

"A _date_? Just what did you let her think was going on?" Misato growled. Asuka was beginning to feel less tired. She noticed the hallway they were standing in, the familiar stain on the ceiling. _You did bring me home. Like a real man._  
"约会？你到底让她以为我们在干什么？" 美里咆哮道。明日香开始感觉不那么疲倦了。她注意到了他们所站的走廊，天花板上熟悉的污渍。你确实带我回家了。像个真正的男人。

Less tired than she had felt in longer than she could remember. Now that she was awake properly, she could feel that Kaji had grabbed onto her legs more securely while she had slept, but was now loosening his grip almost experimentally, as if testing how much he could let go without letting her fall.  
比她记忆中任何时候都要不那么疲惫。现在她完全清醒了，能感觉到在她熟睡时，卡吉曾更紧地抓住了她的双腿，但现在他的手正逐渐放松，仿佛在试探性地测试，在不让她跌落的前提下，自己能松开多少。

"We had a chat. I showed her a little side project I'm working on. Come on, Katsuragi. What would you be implying, anyway?" He chuckled. Asuka felt soothed by the man's laugh causing another rumble in her chest where it pressed up against his back. She was disappointed at his words, however. _But that was—oh, I get it. You don't want to embarrass me. As if I could be embarrassed of you!_  
"我们聊了会儿天。我给她看了我正在做的一个小项目。拜托，葛城，你到底想暗示什么？" 他轻声笑道。明日香被他的笑声抚慰，胸中又是一阵悸动，紧贴着他背部。然而，她对他的话感到失望。不过——哦，我明白了。你不想让我难堪。好像我会为你感到难堪似的！

"You don't have to pretend, _Ryoji_," she said theatrically, smirking at the older woman. _I don't need to borrow your lavender perfume anymore, you decrepit drunk._ Asuka could partially see men walking behind Misato, stacking boxes neatly while others carried them off in handcarts, but that was less important. "_I_ don't mind if she knows we were on a date."  
“你不必假装，Ryoji，”她戏剧化地说道，对那位年长的女性嗤之以鼻。我不再需要借用你的薰衣草香水了，你这衰老的醉鬼。明日香能隐约看到几个男人在 Misato 身后整齐地堆放箱子，而其他人则用手推车将它们运走，但这并不那么重要。“我不介意她知道我们约会过。”

She felt, and heard, Kaji sigh deeply while Misato threw her hands up and rolled her eyes. _What? Kaji? It's not that big of a deal, you don't need her anymore, I'm right here. I always have been._ She debated between kissing his cheek or sticking out her tongue at her clearly defeated foe when said foe began walking away, towards the men she had been partially obscuring earlier. Revealing the door the men were moving boxes out of.  
她感觉到并听到加持深深地叹了口气，而美里则双手一挥，翻了个白眼。什么？加持？这没什么大不了的，你不再需要她了，我就在这儿。我一直都在。她犹豫着是亲吻他的脸颊还是对明显败下阵来的对手吐舌头，这时对手开始走开，朝她之前部分遮挡的那些男人走去。露出了那些男人正从里面搬出箱子的门。

"Hey, kiddo," Kaji said, shaking his head and letting go entirely of her legs, still keeping his hands hovering below them. "You knew we were just talking. That wasn't a _date_, Asuka."  
“嘿，小家伙，”加持摇着头说，完全放开了她的腿，但手仍然悬在下面。“你知道我们只是在聊天。那不是约会，明日香。”

"You wait until _now_ to tell her?!" Misato yelled accusatively over her shoulder, interrupting whatever she was saying to one of the men with a handcart.  
"你到现在才告诉她？！" 美里责备地大喊，一边回头打断了自己对推车男子说的话。

Asuka finally connected what was happening.  
明日香终于明白了正在发生的事情。

"No!" Asuka shrieked, kicking her legs out to drop free from Kaji. _They can't get rid of me! Nothing is wrong with me! I'm doing my job! I'm still better than everyone else!_  
"不！" 明日香尖叫着，踢腿挣脱了加持。他们不能摆脱我！我没有任何问题！我还在履行我的职责！我仍然比其他人强！

"Asuka, calm down," Kaji said, turning to face her, turning to stand with _Misato_. "I don't know what you thought we were doing, but—"  
"明日香，冷静点，"加持说着，转向她，与美里并肩而立。"我不知道你以为我们在做什么，但是——"

"Just shut up!" Asuka yelled. "That's not—it _was_ a date! But this is more important!" Misato crossed her arms over her chest and growled.  
“闭嘴！”明日香喊道，“那不是——那是约会！但这个更重要！”美里交叉双臂抱在胸前，低声咆哮。

"You've really done it now, Kaji. All I asked you to do was distract her so I could move her stuff out—"  
"这下你可真是搞砸了，加持。我只不过让你分散她的注意力，好让我把她东西搬走——"

"You _knew?!_" Asuka yelled, stepping back from Kaji in outrage. _They're getting rid of me and you didn't tell me?_  
"你知道？!" 明日香大喊，愤怒地从加持身边退开。他们要把我赶走，你竟然没告诉我？

"Of mice and men, right?" Kaji grinned at Misato, who raised an eyebrow at him.  
"人生不如意事十之八九，对吧？" 加持对美里咧嘴一笑，美里则挑起眉毛看着他。

"Don't ignore me!" Asuka demanded. "You can't just kick me out!"  
"别无视我！" 明日香要求道。"你不能就这样把我赶出去！"

"What?" Misato asked Kaji. She blinked and looked at Asuka. "What?" She asked again without waiting for a reply to her first question, looking more confused. "Kick you out? I mean, kinda, but only so that you can move in with me, Asuka. Oh, um—surprise?"  
"什么？" 美里问加持。她眨了眨眼，看向明日香。"什么？" 她不等第一个问题的回答，又问了一遍，看起来更加困惑。"赶你出去？我的意思是，有点吧，但只是为了让你搬来和我一起住，明日香。哦，呃——惊喜？"

It was Asuka's turn to blink in confusion. "So, I'm not being sent back to Germany?" _I'm not useless?_  
"轮到明日香困惑地眨眼了。“所以，我不会被送回德国？”我不是没用的？”

"NERV Berlin?" Misato asked incredulously. "Why would we send you there? We need you here, Asuka." _Because no one else cares about what's going on. You want me here to do the work because you're too lazy and incompetent to do it yourself._ "I just knew you wouldn't want to move away from your duties as a pilot, so I was _trying_ to get Kaji to take you somewhere long enough for me to make it a surprise. But _clearly_ he messed that up." She emphasized her ire with a glare at the man, who had moved to stand out of the way of the two arguing women.  
"“NERV 柏林？”美里难以置信地问。“我们为什么要送你去那里？我们需要你在这里，明日香。”因为没人关心这里发生了什么。你想让我留在这里工作，因为你太懒惰无能，自己不想做。“我就知道你不会想离开飞行员职责，所以我试图让加持带你去个地方，好让我有时间把它变成一个惊喜。但显然他把事情搞砸了。”她用瞪向那个男人的目光加重了她的愤怒，那男人已经移到两个争吵的女人之外的地方。”

"I'm moving in with you." Asuka said slowly. Her energy was starting to fade as another altercation ended sooner than expected. Her regular fog of fatigue was returning in its place. "Because you want me to take more time off?"  
“我要搬来和你一起住。”明日香缓缓说道。随着又一次争执比预期更早结束，她的精力开始消退，惯常的疲惫感又悄然回归。“因为你希望我多休息？”

"Yup!" Misato smiled brightly and gave Asuka a thumbs up. _Where were you before._ Asuka swayed slightly in place. She remembered actually sleeping through the night, sometimes. Remembered clothes that cleaned, folded, and put themselves away seemingly autonomously. Remembered cleanliness that required no effort, meals that were brought to her.  
"没错！" 美里灿烂地笑着，向明日香竖起了大拇指。你之前在哪儿呢？明日香微微摇晃着站在原地。她记得自己有时能整夜安睡，记得衣物仿佛自主地洗净、折叠并归置好。记得无需费力的清洁，以及送到面前的餐食。

But these days she was always busy. Working. Finding more work. Having trouble focusing because there was just so much to do, so much of it unimportant but annoyingly necessary. The long walk to the cafeteria. Cleaning up the accumulated mess in her room. Doing laundry.  
但这些日子她总是忙得不可开交。工作，寻找更多的工作。因为要做的事情实在太多，其中许多虽不重要却烦人地必不可少，导致她难以集中注意力。比如那段去食堂的漫长路程，清理房间里积攒的杂乱，还有洗衣服。

If only she had more time to work instead of needing to focus on little things. And she was just tired. _Who could want an annoying child like you, anyway. They need you, that's all that matters. At least this is proof._  
要是她能有更多时间专注于工作，而不是被琐事牵扯就好了。而且她只是累了。无论如何，谁会想要一个像你这样烦人的孩子呢。他们需要你，这才是最重要的。至少这是证明。

"Ok," Asuka said, opening her eyes to see a slightly concerned Misato and an unreadable Kaji holding one hand up, ready to steady Asuka in case she stumbled. She restrained the urge to recoil from Kaji's touch. _Even if it's just because they need me._ "Fine." _And I'm too busy to do chores around my quarters in the Geofront like a housewife. I have real work I need to do. Maybe this actually can help._
