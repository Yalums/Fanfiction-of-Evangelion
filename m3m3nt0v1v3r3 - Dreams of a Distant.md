凌·冬 翻译


"There was a dark little flame in her chest that wouldn’t go out. It stoked itself on the pleasure of possessing him, and his kindness was kindling to the fire. No matter what she tried, how she reminded herself of how damned they both were, it refused to die. Pathetic. Utterly pathetic, she thought. But still: she couldn’t help, in her quiet moments, as she lay with him or watched him hum as he cooked for her, as he held her, as she clawed him and kissed him, leaving marks that would brand him as hers, she couldn’t help at these times but to draw inside her chest for a moment and hold the flame in her hands. It burned, certainly, but it was beautiful and it was spreading."

“有一簇黑暗的小小火苗，在她的胸口潜伏不出。它趁着占有他的喜悦掇弄自己，他的温柔使它持续燃烧。无论有多少次她尝试，无论她如何提醒自己，他们两个多么糟糕不堪，它始终不肯熄灭。多可怜啊，多可悲，她心想。然而，某些时刻，她无法忍耐，当安静的时分，她依偎着他；当他为她做饭的时候听他哼歌，当他拥她入怀，当她擒吻着他，留下那标志着他属于她的印记，她忍不住会在心里描摹出火苗的样子，用双手捧住。当然很灼烫，但却是美丽的，而且还在蔓延。”

In the aftermath of Third Impact, Shinji and Asuka awake together and settle into the quiet agonies of waiting and redemption. As old friends reappear and their hearts heal, they begin to question the very nature of this reality...

在第三次冲击之后，Shinji和Asuka同时醒过来，面临着静默的等待和赎回之苦。当老朋友们先后复归，他们的心得到治愈，他们开始质疑这现实本身的存在性……

### Chapter 1: Autumn

A near constant dance of souls, interrupted only by brief sparks of dull sorrow and recognition.

近乎永恒的灵魂之舞，被空虚的悲伤和认知的短暂火花打断。

She remembered making cookies, once, with her mother. It seemed like eons ago. Worlds away. Practically a different galaxy now. She remembered making cookies: they rolled the dough out into a single sheet. They sliced shapes—little gingerbread men and women—and, freed from their primordial clay, the cookies hardened and swelled in the oven while she watched. She tugged at her mother’s apron—when would they be done? Soon, mein Schätzchen, soon.

她记起了从前有一次，她和妈妈一起做饼干。那好像是亘古以前，相隔了数条世界线，可以说完全不在一个平行宇宙内发生的事。她记得做饼干的过程：他们把生面团揉成薄薄的一片，切成小块——变成小小的姜饼小人——然后，她看着曲奇饼们脱离最初的陶土形态，在烤炉里变硬变大。她拉着妈妈的围裙——什么时候才算好呀？很快，mein Schätzchen（德语：我亲爱的），很快就好。

But this was cookies in reverse. The gingerbread men and women softened, melded and molded themselves back into clay, and rejoined the thick, undifferentiated mass. The distinctions between each cookie disappeared with pounding and pressing, and soon they were all the same.

但如今却是曾经的反过程。姜饼男女们变软，融化，把自己塑回泥土的样子，重新回到了厚厚的、无差别的一团混沌。在挤压碰撞中，每一块饼干之间的差别消失了，很快它们变得不分彼此。

Soon, they were not they, but it. You shouldn’t be able to reverse entropy—that was a basic tenet of thermodynamics (I explained it to him, once, she remembered) and yet, here they were.

很快，他们不再是他们，而是它。你不可能让熵值回溯——那是基本的热力学概念（我对他解释过，之前那一次，她还记得）然而现在，却实现了。

I hate this, Wondergirl. I want to go back. I hate that everyone can see… everything.

我讨厌这样，优等生。（-wondergirl，奇迹女孩？对应日语里的优等生称呼ww）我想回去。我不喜欢每个人都能看见……每件事。

Those stupid ruby eyes somehow managed to look smug, even here, even when their souls were interwoven, along with the rest of humanity. Save one soul, whose absence she had noticed almost immediately.

这双愚蠢的红宝石色的眼睛，甚至在这儿，在她们的灵魂和整个人类种族纠缠不分的时候，看上去还是有点儿自视甚高。每当一个灵魂获得新生，她几乎立刻能够意识到它的缺席。

But there’s no pain here. No sorrow. Nothing to divide you from others.

But that’s just it. I want those things.

但是这里没有痛苦。没有悲伤。没有什么可以使你与他人隔绝。

但也就只是这样罢了。正是我想要的。

You want to feel pain?

‘你想要感受痛苦？’

My whole life has been pain. It just doesn’t feel right otherwise.

我的一生都是痛苦的（虽然才活了十多年）。如果没了痛苦，反而不对头了。

The placid stare didn’t even blink.

凝视着她的温和眼睛甚至都没有眨过一回。

That was a joke. Kind of. I’m not sure I believe that the boundaries between souls have broken down if you didn’t even get that.

I got it. It just wasn’t very funny.

‘你有那么点像在说笑。其实灵魂之间的隔阂应该已经被拆除了——如果你还没有意识到这一点的话。’

我知道。只是觉得一点都不好笑。

She didn’t realize it, of course, but she was the only soul in all of humanity’s primordial soup to feel rage. The entire human race gave a gentle shudder.

其实，她没意识到，自己是所有人类原始之海中唯一感到盛怒的灵魂。整个人类种族都因为她而轻微地震荡了。

You know he left.

Who?

You know who I mean.

I don’t care. I don’t want to see him.

You’re lying.

‘你知道他不在。’

谁？

‘你知道我在说谁。’

我不管。我才不想见他。

‘你在撒谎。’

Shut up. Let’s cut to the chase. The part where you let me out.

Even after what he did to you—and what you did—

I don’t want your pity, okay? I just want out of this. Let me out, Wondergirl.

闭嘴。别兜圈子，咱们言归正传：放我出去。

即使在他对你做了那样的事——还有你做的种种——

我不想要你的同情，好吗？我只是离开这儿。放我走，优等生。

Finally, the red eyes widened. Then narrowed. This felt—warm. Somewhere inside. Or outside. It wasn’t like she had a body anymore.（-who？）

终于，红色的眼睛睁大了。又眯成缝。这感觉——很温暖。仿佛是在什么地方的里面，或者是外面。自己的身体像是不复存在。

Why did you think I was pitying you? I’m relieved.

Shut up, okay? I just want to go back. I don’t care what happened. I do care, but I want to go back. Let me go back.

‘为什么你会觉得我在同情你呢？ 我已经解脱了。’（想表达的是大白丽已经不再有人的情感了，所以自然也没有同情）*已经额外又找人核实了这句的翻译应该没问题了。

闭上嘴好吗？我只想回去。我才不管那么多哩。虽然我也在乎，但我还是想回去。让我回去吧。

It’s not up to me, Asuka. Every soul here can return if they want to.

Then I’m out. Seriously. Cool experiment, but I’m done with you, I’m done with NERV, I’m done with this Instrumentality bullshit, I’m done.

‘决定权不在我，明日香。每个灵魂都可以凭自己的意愿决定去留。’（稍微意译了一下....）

那我就走了。我认真的。这实验虽然很酷，但我已经受够你了，我受够NERV了，我受够这个垃圾补完计划了，我受够了。

But you’re not done with Ikari.

‘但你还没有受够碇君。’

Shut up.

You know he’s alone.

I said, shut up—

闭嘴。

‘你知道他是一个人。’

我说了，闭嘴——

She pressed forward and reached the crux of her thesis.

You know, Asuka, that he’s got no one else and the idea of being everything to someone, even someone who betrayed you—

Rei, please, please, I’m asking you to shut up. Please. Don’t be cruel.

Take care of him, then. And yourself.

她继续施压，找到了她观点的核心：

‘你知道，明日香，他没有人可依靠，你就是他的全部，即使他背叛过你——’

丽，别说了，拜托，我求你闭上嘴。拜托了。别那么残忍。

‘那，照顾好他，还有你自己。’

Asuka felt—like Asuka again. Even as she talked to Rei—still an outgrowth of the swirling miasma of disintegrated human consciousnesses—she felt the comforting return of absences: suddenly, the myriad lives and experiences and sorrows and joys all around her were distant cries. And then, they fell silent.

明日香觉得，自己又重新变回明日香了。甚至当她和丽——仍然是一团旋转不休的、崩离的、人类混合意识的衍生物——交谈时，她也能感受到从他们当中离开的舒适：一时之间，数以亿计的生活经历喜悦伤悲皆围绕着她持续呼喊，在这之后，它们全都安静了。

“Rei,” Asuka asked, and she gave a soft gasp when she heard her voice—her own voice—once more. “Can I ask one last question?”

“丽,”明日香问。她再次听见声音——她自己的声音时，她轻轻吸了一口气。“我能最后问一个问题吗？”

The eyes softened. Was she going to cry? Which one of them was crying? Maybe both?

那双眼睛变得柔和。她要哭了吗？是哪只眼睛要哭了？也许都要？

Of course.

“Are you God?”

‘当然。’

“你是神吗？”

I… don’t know.

Asuka nodded.

“It sounds like that’s a no, then. Since you’re not omniscient and all that. By definition.”

‘我……不知道。’

明日香点头。

“那就不是了。因为你并非全知全能。从定义上说。”

‘I think the truth is more complicated and frightening than that, Asuka.’

我认为真相可能比那更复杂，也更吓人，明日香。

She would have liked to ask Rei more. Finally, she got the blue-haired doll to open up a bit, even if it took the world ending and humanity collapsing inward on itself to do it. She’d studied philosophy once upon a time—it really hadn’t been that long ago, had it? Didn’t Nietzsche have a part about this? Vielleicht sollen sie auf Deutsch diskutieren—

她本想要问丽更多问题。终于，她可以让这个蓝发的洋娃娃女孩稍微敞开点心扉了，虽然代价是世界灭绝，人性坍塌回了原点。她有一次研究过哲学——应该不是很久之前才对。难道Nietzsche（-尼采）没有提到过类似的观点吗？Vielleicht sollen sie auf Deutsch diskutieren—（-也许他们应该用德语来交谈这件事）

The discussion would have to wait, however, because in that moment, Asuka realized she was real, once more. She had a body. Her body ached. Everything ached. And the hands around her neck, the thumbs digging into her windpipe, the sweaty palms crushing the muscles of her throat—they ached most of all.

不过，这个话题得留着以后再说，因为在那个时刻，明日香意识到她重新变得有血有肉了。她有了身体。她的身体疼痛不已。每一处都疼得要命。还有双手掐着她的脖子，拇指深深地嵌进她的气管，汗涔涔的掌心将她喉部的肌肉按扁了——这些肌肉是最疼的。

That bastard. That idiot. His stupid face. She reached for it. She wanted to speak to him—scream at him, tell him to go to hell, tell him to kill himself, tell him how badly she hated him, how irredeemably he’d broken her. That he’d choke her, but he wouldn’t hold her—but she had no breath with which to speak.

那个蠢货。那个笨蛋。他愚蠢的脸。她伸出手去。她想要朝他说话——冲他叫嚣，告诉他快点去死吧，快点滚下地狱去，告诉他自己有多恨他，他打碎了她的心，无处挽回。他掐住她的喉咙，却不肯抱她——但她无法呼吸，所以哪句话都说不出来。

Instead, her hand moved as if on its own. It found his cheek and she rested it there. It was a small thing, but the warmth of his flesh, the softness of his skin… After feeling nothing for who knows how long, it was practically a feast. His grip went slack and a soft trickle of air wormed into her lungs.

她的手却和她的想法相反，好像自己有意志似的动了起来，找到他的脸颊，停留其上。那是一个小小的举动，但是他身体的温暖，他皮肤的柔软……经历了鬼知道有多久的毫无知觉，这样的触感就像一场盛宴。他的手垮了下来，一小簇空气轻柔地灌入她的肺。

His head bowed. Crying. Sobs. Idiot, she thought. It’s just like you to make this all about you.

他的头低垂了。哭泣。抽噎。白痴。显得像我做的这一切都是为了你似的，她心想。

“I feel gross,” she muttered. Wondergirl’s stupid face—half of it, at least—smirked at them. Or at nothing in particular. From across the sea of LCL. Maybe coming back hadn’t been such a great idea.

“真恶心。”她嘟囔着。优等生愚蠢的脸——只有一半——从LCL海的对岸对他们诡笑着（参考eoe结尾大白丽的表情，她不是真的在笑，牵动面部的肌肉导致她的唇角上扬可能更适合形容那个表情hhh 不过诡笑这个词也不是非常恰当，或许展开说成“诡异地笑着”更合适)。或者是对着虚空。也许回来也不是什么好主意。

She shoved him with her good hand and started to lean forward. A strangled gasp of pain spilled out of her chapped lips.

“Shinji, help me.”

她用完好的手推开他，然后往前倾身。扭曲的痛苦涌溢而出，她干裂的唇发出一阵喘息。

“真嗣，帮帮我。”

He kept crying. Idiot—what was this all for, then?

他还在哭。笨蛋——哭有什么用呢？

“Did you go deaf in there?” she scowled. “My body is all messed up. Help me up. Quick. Come on. We’re not in that kitchen anymore. This is real. Just help me.”

“你是聋了吗？”她斥道，“我的身子全都糟透了。扶我起来。快点。来啊。我们已经不在那个餐厅里了。这是现实。来帮帮我。”

Still, the tears. She’d have to do everything herself, like always. His forehead rested against her belly, quaked with each sob, and she managed to swat him, seizing a fistful of hair.

眼泪，还是眼泪。老样子，她依然得自力更生。他的额头抵着她的肚子，随着每声抽泣而震颤不休。她设法打了他一下，抓住他的一簇头发。

“Shinji, you idiot, help me stand up.” She licked her lips but everything was dry. “Listen, I’m gonna’ be sick. Sick. You get it?”

“真嗣，你这笨蛋，扶我站起来。”她舔着嘴唇，但一切都是干瘪的。“听着，我要犯恶心了。恶心。你懂不懂？”

She saw understanding in his pink eyes. He took hold of her and she shuddered—not from the pain—but his touch was light as he pulled her to her feet.

她看见他的红眼睛有了理解的意思。他抓住她的手，她颤抖——不是因为疼——而是他把她拉起来时，他的触摸很轻盈。

“Good. Help me over to the shore.”

He obeyed, wordless as he shifted her good arm around his shoulders. He started to put an arm around his waist.

“好。现在扶我去岸边。”

他遵从了，一言不发，他将她完好的那只手搭在他肩头。他的手环住她的腰侧。

“Um, like this? Is this okay?”

“It’s fine,” she grunted.

“Asuka, I’m sorry. I’m so, so, so sorry. I’m so sorry. I know—I know there’s nothing I can do—“

“呃，像这样？这样可以吗？”

“可以。”她闷声说。

“明日香，对不起。真的，真的，真的很对不起。太对不起了。我知道——我知道我什么都做不了——”

“Shut up. I didn’t come back to this—literally—god-forsaken world—just to hear you apologize.”

“I know but…”

“闭嘴，我来到这个——字面意思上——遭天谴的世界，可不是为了听你道歉！”

“我知道，但是……”

“We’ll talk about it later.” They had reached the water’s edge. Not water, she reminded herself, with grim pleasure. The souls of all humanity.

“我们以后会谈到的。”他们来到海的边缘。不是海水，她带着阴郁的满足感提醒自己。这些都是全人类的灵魂。

In shaking spurts, she sank to her knees and leaned forward.

她颤巍巍地小步向前一跳，跪倒下去。

“I hate all of you,” she whispered to the entire human race, and vomited. It was bile—Rei apparently hadn’t seen fit to recreate her with a full stomach, though she had made sure to include the almost-fresh wounds and—and—and—the thing growing inside her

“我讨厌你们所有人。”她对着人类一族轻声说道，然后呕吐。吐的是胆汁——丽显然没有在造她的时候给她一个健全的肠胃，虽然她很细心地造出了几乎是新鲜的伤口，还有，还有，还有——从她内心膨胀起来的东西。

“Shinji,” she sputtered. “Don’t just stand there. Hold my hair.”

“Oh. Sorry.”

“真嗣，”她急促地说，“别干站着，抓住我的头发。”

“噢。抱歉。”

She felt his fingers slide through her hair. Gentle. She hated how gentle he was being. As if he might break her. As if he hadn’t already. As if he hadn’t done what she’d done, once, that night months ago—

她感到他的手指滑入她的发丝间。动作温柔。她讨厌他这么温柔。仿佛他可能会弄碎她。就像他不是已经这么做了一样。就像他没有做那件她以前早做过的，曾经，在几个月以前的夜晚——

Again, and again, and again, she puked, till her throat screamed. Her entire being was pain and nausea.

一次又一次，一次又一次，她吐着，直到她的嗓子冒烟了。她全身都疼痛不堪，恶心反胃。

“This last one is for your dad, Shinji,” she muttered and pitched forward one last time. “I think I got him.”

“Good aim.”

“最后一口是吐给你爸的，真嗣，”她闷声说，最后往前呕了一次，“我想我吐到他身上了。”

“好目标。”

“Sorry if I got your mom too. Or my mom. Or Misato. Maybe I hit Rei—that’s okay.”

“I’m sure Ayanami will forgive you.”

She held up her arms.

“不好意思也吐到你妈妈身上了。或者我妈妈。或者美里。可能我也击中了丽——没关系。”

“我确定绫波会原谅你的。”

她抬起双臂。

“I can’t walk just yet. Up.”

“我还走不动。扶我。”

He was all too quick to oblige. He squatted, threaded his arms under her knees. He had trouble standing back up, though, and she pushed them forward with her good arm as she pressed in with her weight. That still didn’t work, so she used her legs to push off and then, with a quick little leap, wrapped them around her waist.

他顺从得太迅速了。蹲下，把手揽入她的双膝，虽然站起来的时候有点麻烦。她用完好的手撑地把他们往前推，把她自身的体重压到他身上。还是没成功，所以她用上了脚，迅速地一跳，紧勾住他的腰。

Shinji didn’t question how she could manage that maneuver while being unable to walk, and she wasn’t about to defend it.

真嗣没问为什么她可以作蹬腿，却不能走路，她也没打算反驳。

She rested her chin in the crook of his neck. Smelled the sweat and the coppery tinge of blood still clinging to their skin. Almost let her lips touch his ear.

I’m pathetic.

她把下巴搭在他弯曲的颈部上。闻着汗味和仍然粘在皮肤上的几滴血的铜锈味。几乎要让她的嘴唇贴着他的耳朵。

我真可怜。

~

It was a long way to walk to find somewhere that had resisted the tides of LCL. A few times, Shinji had stopped in front of an apartment building or a house and Asuka had nixed it—didn’t look clean, she’d say, or didn’t look sturdy. He wasn’t sure he agreed with her, but even though his arms ached from carrying her, he didn’t feel like he was in any position to argue with her.

走到能拦住LCL的海潮的地方还有好长的路。有几次，真嗣会在一栋公寓或者一座房屋前停下来，但是明日香不同意——她要么说看上去不干净，要么就说不稳定。他不确定自己是否同意她，但尽管他的手臂背得快要断了，他也不觉得自己有任何权利跟她争辩。

Not after what he’d done to her.

Three sins, all intertwined. There were more, of course, but those felt like part of the tapestry of their relationship, whatever it had been. Those sins hadn’t torn the tapestry（织锦，锦缎） itself（-是俗语还是？）参考英文的修辞手法metaphor（隐喻，不在被比作的事物之前加like），他在借织物形容“复杂和相互交错的程度”。 like these had.

自他对她做了那些事以后。

有三项罪过，全部互相纠缠。当然还有更多，但不管是什么，只是给他们本就错综复杂的关系雪上加霜罢了。那些罪并没有像这三项罪过那样。

Moving backwards in time—choking her, of course. She’d mentioned the kitchen—so she’d seen it too, in there. Maybe he could play it off that he thought they were still there, in the lake, in the hell custom-built for two. But that wasn’t entirely the truth. Part of it, sure—but some other part of him suspected, even knew that they were free, and that same part knew what came next. The talking. The accusations. The crying. The blame. The guilt. The pain. Everything that came with knowing other people. And his reaction had been…

时间往前回溯——他掐了她，当然了。她提到了厨房，所以她肯定也在那个地方见证了他的作为。或许他可以糊弄说，他以为他们还在湖里，在那个见鬼的二人世界里。但那不完全是真相。一部分是真的——但还有一部分令他怀疑，即使知道了他们已经自由，他依然还是会重蹈覆辙。那些对话。那些指控。哭泣。责难。愧疚。痛苦。这一切都来自于和他人接触。而他的回应却是……

The second sin, no matter which way you approached it, was one of inaction. He knew what had happened that day, and even though her body had been put back together, her scars hadn’t healed. He’d seen the memory, while in the lake, replayed in her mind—all of humanity’s mind now—over and over, felt the pain of being ripped to shreds by the mass-produced monsters. He could have stopped it. He’d ignored her cries. Or, rather, he had tried not to hear them.

第二项罪过，不管他是什么方式达到的，都可归结于不作为。他知道那一天发生了什么，即使她的身体被拼合回去了，她的伤疤还是没有治愈。在湖里的生活，他看见了她脑海里回放的记忆——现在是全人类的脑海了——反反复复，感受着被量产机怪兽撕扯剥拽成碎片的痛苦。他本可以阻止这件事。他却无视了她的呐喊。或者说，他试图当做没有听见。

Because of the first sin. The original sin. The sin where he locked the door to her hospital room. Hoisted himself on top of her. Kissed her sleeping lips and dared her to wake up and see what he was doing to her. Ached for it, if only she would react to him. If only she’d prove he weren’t alone.

是因为那第一项罪恶。原罪。这罪就是，他把她病房的门锁了起来，撑着身子爬到她上面，亲吻熟睡的她的双唇，逼她醒来，看看他对她做了什么好事。他渴求着，如果她能给些反应就好了！如果她能证明他不是孤零零的一个人就好了。

But she hadn’t. He couldn’t even find tears as he’d cleaned her up, as best he could, rearranged her pillow and covered her. Wiped her off, first with his hand, and then a wash cloth. He’d thought of throwing himself out the window right then, but he hadn’t even had the courage for that.

但她没醒。当他尽他所能清洁她的身体，重新铺好枕头，盖上被子时，他甚至找不到一滴眼泪。他先用手擦拭她，再用毛巾。他本想跳出窗户一死了之的，结果他连那赴死的勇气都没有。

And she knew all of this. He’d expected her hatred, but somehow, this tenderness cut even worse. When he felt himself reaching pits of despair he hadn’t even imagined, even in the darkest days and nights of piloting the Eva, he found her arms holding him tighter. As if—instructing him. This is what I wanted, idiot, she seemed to be saying with her mutilated limbs.

她肯定知道所有的事。他本以为她会恨他，但不知怎的，这份温柔反而更令他心碎。当他体会到了从未想象过的，哪怕是最黑暗的昼夜里驾驶着EVA都比不上的绝望时，他却发现她的双臂抱他更紧了。就好像——在教导他：这就是我要的，笨蛋，她似乎在用她残缺的肢体传达这个意思。

“We could always go back to Misato’s,” he said, finally. The sun—as it were—seemed to be setting. Would the electric grid still be operational? Maybe—so much was automated these days. As if the architects and urban planners rebuilding after Second Impact had predicted this.

“我们任何时候都可以回到美里小姐的家。”终于，他说道。太阳——一如既往——马上就要落山了。电网还在正常运转吗？也许吧——毕竟这些年来什么都是自动化了。就像建筑学家和城市规划者在第二次冲击后重建时已经预料到了这一点。

“We might as well,” she said. “Our stuff is there. I want to change out of this thing.”

“那我们就去吧。”她说，“我们的东西都在那里。我想要换掉这家伙。”

The plug suit. There was a time when she had been so proud to wear it. The artificial skin that still transmitted her warmth, even though he was the last person in the world to deserve it. And now—a useless, sticky remembrance of a time that would never come again. A second placenta,（胎盘） he realized, and he was about to point that out to her when he realized she was still talking.

战斗服。曾经有段时间她是如此骄傲能穿上它。人造皮肤仍然在传递她的热量，尽管他是世界上最不值得这份温暖的人。现在，这只是一件无用的、碍事的东西，提醒着以后永远不会再到来的时光。简直是第二个胎盘。（-注：这里类似于重新出生，战斗服作为胎盘一样的寓意）他意识到，正当他想指出来时，发现她还在讲话。

“…weird without people around,” she mumbled. “Why did we come back? I thought others would too. Soon.”

“I don’t know.”

“……一个人都没有，好奇怪啊。”她低声念叨，“为什么我们会回来呢？我以为其他人也会回来。应该比我们还快。”

“我不知道。”

“Why did you come back?”

“Don’t you know?”

“To carry me around for the rest of my natural life in penance?”

He winced and she jabbed him with her elbow.

“You’re getting off easy, Third Child.”

“I know I am. I still feel bad.”

“那你为什么回来？”

“你不知道？”

“为了在我余下的生命里，背着我东奔西跑来赎你的罪？”

他畏缩了，她用胳膊肘戳了戳他。

“你也太容易被调侃了，第三适格者。”

“我知道，我还是感觉很糟糕。”

“Idiot. You should, though.”

“Don’t worry. I do.”

“You were really, really dumb, you know. If I’d been awake—“

“笨蛋。虽然你活该如此。”

“别担心，我早就觉得了。”

“你真的，真的好迟钝啊，你自己也知道吧。如果我那时还醒着——”

He winced again and she seemed to waver before plunging forward. He expected a dagger to the heart but instead—

他又畏缩了，她似乎左右晃了一下，往前倾身。他做好了被恶语穿心的准备，没想到——

“I would have been okay with it, you know. That’s what makes you so stupid. If you’d just—tried, a little(译文没问题w)…” His head drooped and he felt her swallow hard by his ear. “But, I mean, I understand. I’m pretty insufferable. No one loves me. You’re really getting what you deserve, you know? Stuck on a dead planet with me and only me. I’ve been living it for almost fifteen years and it’s hell.”

“我可能还是会容让你的，你知道。就是这件事才让你显得这么地傻。如果你当时试着……多一点……”他的脑袋恹恹低垂，感觉到她在耳旁用力吞口水，“但是，我的意思是，我理解你。我天生恼人厌，所以没人喜欢我。你只是得到了应得的份，你明白吗？跟我一起被塞在同一个死寂的星球上，而且只有我。我已经活了将近十五年了，知道这儿是个人间地狱。”

“Asuka,” he whispered. “Don’t talk like that. I don’t hate you.”

“Yes,” she whispered back, as if they were sharing a secret. “You do. And I hate you. But I hate myself most of all, so in a way, you’re my favorite person.” She leaned her head back and Shinji heard a soft chorus of sharp cracks as Asuka grunted. “Isn’t that sick?”

“明日香，”他小声说，“别这样说。我一点都不讨厌你。”

“不，”她轻声怼（这个字用得很好ww）回来，就像他们在分享一个秘密，“你讨厌的很。而且我也讨厌你。但我最讨厌的是我自己，所以这样子一来，你就成了我最喜欢的人了。”她把脑袋缩回去，真嗣听见少许支离破碎的喉音轻轻附和着她的咕哝声：一声支离破碎的尖笑，就像轻柔的合音，咕哝着：“是不是很恶俗？”

“If it helps, I feel the same way.”

“Really?”

“如果这么说能帮到你的话，我也有同样的感觉。”

“真的？”

“I don’t think I hate you at all, actually, but—myself—I don’t know if I can ever love myself,” he said as they turned onto the silent block where they’d lived for those few months that somehow felt like lifetimes ago. “I think I hate myself right now. Maybe I will forever. But I don’t hate you at all.”

“虽然我一点都不讨厌你，但是——我自己——我都不知道是不是能够喜欢自己，”他说，当他们走上住了几个月的寂静的街区时，不知怎么的，感觉就像是几辈子前的事了，“我现在非常讨厌自己。也许以后都会讨厌下去。但我绝不会讨厌你。”

“That’s the nicest thing anyone’s ever said to me.”

“No way.”

“Really.”

“That’s impossible. You were always so great.”

“那是人能对我说的最动听的话了。”

“不可能。”

“真的。”

“怎么可能，你一直都很厉害。”

Shinji felt her grip tighten.

“Don’t say that, please.”

真嗣感到她的手收紧了。

“别这样说，拜托了。”

“But it’s true! You’re so smart, and you worked so hard. And in the end you…” Shinji stopped. Of course, her greatest victory was also her most painful defeat. Maybe I really am as stupid as she says I am, he thought with a sad little sigh.

“是真的！你是那么聪明，又那么努力。但到头来你……”真嗣停住了。自然，她最伟大的胜利也是最痛苦的惨败。也许我真的就像她说的那么笨，他想着，悲伤地叹了口气。

One piece of luck shone through for both of them: they had arrived at the apartment block. When Shinji tapped in the key code, the doors clicked open. The lights in the lobby flickered now and then, but otherwise…

Everything was the same.

零星一点幸运之光终于照耀了两人：他们来到了公寓街区。真嗣按完门锁密码，门弹开了。走廊上的灯一闪一暗，但除此以外……

一切如常。

“We’re home,” they said in unison, stepping into the tiny apartment. They waited for a moment.

“我们回来了。”他们一齐说道，踏入了公寓的小套间。接着停顿了一会儿。

“Somehow, I thought Misato might be here,” Shinji said.

“Whatever happened to her?”

“You didn’t see?”

“不知怎么回事，我还以为美里小姐会在这里呢。”真嗣说。

“她经历了什么？”

“你没看见吗？”

“I guess I missed it. It was hard to see any one thing at once in there.”

“They shot her. While she was trying to get me to Unit One. To save you.”

Shinji watched her nostrils flare （鼻翼微微张开，这个表达方式通常是用在描写人试图伪装情绪/说谎时的）很多介绍‘How to Recognize Someone is Lying/Deceiving’的段落中均有提到这个词. He helped her to sit down at the dining room table—the one he’d overturned, in their mutual dream.

“我想我错过了。在那个地方很难一次只注意一件事。”

“他们用枪射了她。她想要带我到初号机里去。为了救你。”

真嗣看见她的鼻翼细微地抽动了一下。然后扶着她坐到餐厅桌旁——就是那个他们共享的梦境里他推翻的那个桌子。

“I’m glad you made her death worth it.”

“I know. I’m sorry.”

“Don’t apologize unless you mean it. Unless you’re going to change. Do you get it? That’s what pisses me off the most about you.”

“I know. I’m sorry.”

“我很高兴你没让她的努力白费。”

“我知道。对不起。”

“别道歉了，除非你是真心实意的。除非你真的想作出改变。你听懂了吗？我最烦的就是你这个样子。”

“我知道。对不起。”

“See? That!”

Shinji hung his head. He noticed Asuka recoil and their eyes met. Suddenly, they were both laughing.

“I seriously thought you were going to do it for a second.”

“Sorry.”

“听见没？就是这个样子！”

真嗣抬起了头，他们的双目相遇后，他发现明日香畏缩了一下。突然间，他们两个都笑了起来。

“有一秒钟我真的以为你又要动手了。”

“对不起。”

“There you go again.”

“I promise I won’t choke you again.”

“Well, that makes me feel better,” Asuka murmured. “Misato really deserved better. She gave us everything, didn’t she? I was such a bitch to her.”

“I wasn’t much better.”

“还来。”

“我保证我再也不会掐你了。”

“嗯，这倒是让我感觉好些了。”明日香喃喃道，“美里值得更好的。她对我们尽心尽责，我对她的态度却像个婊子。”

“我也没好哪儿去。”

“You cooked for her. You tried to take care of her. Both of us. You were more of a housewife than she or I could ever be. I was just…”

“You really didn’t see any of it? When she died?”

“Like I said.”

“你给她做饭，试着照顾她方方面面，也照顾我。你比她或我都更像个家庭主妇。我只是……”

“你真的什么都没看见吗？就是她死之前？”

“我不是说过，我什么都没看见。”

“She kissed me,” Shinji said, tucking his hand behind his head. “And told me she’d show me the rest when it was all over.”

“她吻了我。”真嗣说，一只手扶到脑后头，“然后对我说当事情都结束了，就继续进行剩下的。”

He watched her lips form a sneer and then soften.

“That means she knew she was dying.”

“Right.”

他看见她的嘴唇先是作讥讽的模样，后又变得柔和了。

“这说明她知道她要死了。”

“对的。”

“I bet you would have preferred her here. Over me. Maybe she’ll wake up out of the ooze（这个词特指某些东西从那种谜之液体中缓慢地、黏稠地渗出来的过程....ewww） and come to you and you two can kick me out on the street and have a little slice of heaven all to yourself.”

“Or she’ll be so disgusted with me that she’ll kick me out and you’ll both starve to death.”

“我打赌，比起我，你肯定更愿意她在这儿。也许她会从那些难以形容的液体里爬出来找你，你们同心协力把我一脚踹到大街上，从此过上了极乐天堂的日子。”

“或许她根本没法忍受我这个糟粕，反而把我踹了出去，你俩从此过上了忍饥挨饿的日子。”

Two tired sets of eyes met once more.

“Mein Gott, but we’re really screwed up.”

两双疲惫的眼睛再一次相遇。

“Mein Gott（-上帝啊），我们两个真是烂透了。”

Before Shinji could say anything, a chorus of frantic squeals came from the other room, growing louder and louder until, finally, the chorus leader—a squat bird flapping its useless wings as if trying to catch a taxi on a rainy Tokyo evening—found them.

在真嗣刚想说什么之前，一阵合声般的疯癫尖叫从另一个房间传来，而且越来越响。终于，这位和声歌唱家出现并找到了他们——那只矮墩墩的企鹅，像是要在东京的雨夜里拦下一部计程车似的扇着它无用的翅膀。

“Pen-Pen!” Asuka gasped. “You’re alive!”

The bird flung itself towards her and heaved itself into her lap. She squeezed his belly and he honked, glowering at Shinji.（-这里的penpen为什么怒视真嗣？愤怒/不赞许的情绪——“嘿！瞧瞧小姑娘现在的样子，你根本就没照顾好她！”by penpen语十级翻译员川川（不是））*一边冲明日香撒娇一边默默地鄙视了一下真嗣哈哈哈哈...根据前文，家里应该是没有乱掉的。所以penpen生气的点应该是在于asuka负伤的模样

“Pen-Pen！”明日香吸了一口气，“你还活着！”

这只鸟飞扑向她，钻到她的膝盖中间。在她用力揉搓他肚皮的时候嘎嘎叫着，顺带愤怒地瞟了真嗣一眼。

“I wonder how long he was alone. It makes sense that animals didn’t disappear too, doesn’t it?”

“It feels like he didn’t lose much weight,” Asuka said, squeezing him again.

“我想知道他孤零零呆在这儿多久了。不过这证明了动物好像不会跟着消失，不是吗？”

“看起来没怎么瘦嘛。”明日香说着又挤了挤Pen-Pen。

“Well, he can get into the fridge by himself. And I think Misato went shopping the day before—it all happened.”

Asuka leaned back and winced. “Everyone had plans. Even Misato. She really thought up until the end that we might come back and all have dinner together.”

“Maybe. Or maybe she was trying to fool herself. I wouldn’t put that past her. None of us were doing well at the end.”用英文解释会更好理解：put something past someone = would not be suprised if someone doing something bad. *特指一些负面的事情

“唔，他可以自己到冰箱找吃的。我想美里小姐去过超市，就在——事情发生的前一天。”

明日香往后靠着，缩起身子。“每个人都有自己的打算。美里也不例外。她直到最后也想着我们会团聚，并一起吃晚饭。”

“也许吧。或者她可能只想麻痹自己。如果她真的是这么想的，我一点也不会惊讶。毕竟在那时候我们的状态都很糟糕。”

“The sick thing,” Asuka said, stroking Pen-Pen’s head. “Is that it wasn’t the end. Your dad really fucked everyone.”

“最恶心的，”明日香一边说，一边戳着Pen-Pen的脑袋，“不是结局怎样，而是你爹把所有人都操了一通。”

He couldn’t disagree with that. Asuka set Pen-Pen down and the bird began to waddle over to the fridge.

“Hey, Shinji.”

“Yeah?”

他不能更同意。明日香把Pen-Pen放在地上，企鹅开始摇摇摆摆地走向冰箱。

“嘿，真嗣。”

“什么事？”

She leaned forward on the table, resting her weight on her elbows. Her face shone in the scarlet twilight—moist with sweat and LCL, her one whole eye devouring him, an angry goddess come down from heaven to make things right on Earth. Beauty wasn’t the word for it—sublime, perhaps?

她朝桌子俯身，把身子的一部分重量枕在胳膊肘上。她的脸反射着猩红色的暮光，混合着汗水和LCL，她的独眼将他吞没，像一位震怒的女神从天而降，使地上的万物重回正轨。形容美丽并不合适——也许用“崇高庄重”更好。

“I haven’t forgiven you. I just wanted you to know that.”

“I didn’t think you had. I don’t expect you to. I know there’s nothing I can—“

“Shut up. I’m not done.”

“Sorry.”

“我还没原谅你。我只想让你知道这一点。”

“我没觉得你会，也没期望过你会。我知道没有什么是我能——”

“闭嘴。我还没说完呢。”

“对不起。”

“Remember what I said about that?”

“Sorry.”

“记得我说过的话吗？”

“对不起。”

“You’re doing that on purpose now. Shut up and listen. I don’t forgive you. I shouldn’t forgive you. But I might, because I’m an idiot too. But if you want me to forgive you, and there’s still only a .0001% chance of that ever happening, even if you do everything right, but if you want that chance, then listen: you’re my slave. For the rest of your life. You do what I say. You help me. You’re here for me. Not that it’ll be hard if we’re all that’s left, but you never look at another woman. （-Not和but的关系？这里的not that应该是指nothing，完整的句式=nothing if not, but something，来强调一种extreme level，从中文语序考虑把“不准想”的那句合并在这里）You don’t even think about another woman. I’m all you have. I’m all you live for. Got it?”

“你现在是故意的了！闭上嘴听着，我既没原谅你，也不觉得我应该原谅你。但我可能会，因为我也是个笨蛋。你想要我原谅，即使你做对了每一件事，也只有0.0001%的概率会发生这种情况。但如果你真想得到那个机会，那就听好：从今往后，你永远做我的奴隶。我说什么你就做什么，我让你帮忙你就帮忙。你一直都要陪在我身边。这世上只剩下你我了，你再也不会看到、当然也不许想到其他女人——所以只对我一个人唯命是从并不困难。我就是你活在这里的理由。（*考虑到“一个人”的使用频率，修改了一下表达方式）明白了吗？”

Shinji felt dizzy. Light. He reached for her hand and she took it, squeezed it.

“We’re not back in the kitchen, Shinji. I’m real. You’re real. This is what I want. You hurt me worse than anyone else ever has. Ever will.”

真嗣感觉脑袋晕乎乎，身体轻飘飘的。他去摸她的手，她握住了，用力捏了捏。

“我们现在不在餐厅了，真嗣。我是真的。你也是真的。这就是我想要的。你伤害我的程度比我以前遇到的，比我今后将会遇到的人都要深。”

“I know. I’m sorry.”

“Then prove it.”

“我知道。我很抱歉。”

“那就证明一下。”

“Okay.”

“Say it.”

“Say what?”

“好。”

“你要说出来。”

“说什么？”

“’Asuka, I’m yours, forever and ever, till the end of time.’”

“Asuka, I’m yours, forever and ever, till the end of time.”

“’No matter how fucked up you are.’”

“‘明日香，我愿永远属于你，海枯石烂不分离。’”

“明日香，我愿永远属于你，海枯石烂不分离。”

“‘不论你有多下贱。’”

“But I don’t think you’re fucked up. Really—I think this is a reasonable response to—“

“但我不觉得你下贱。真的，我觉得你对我的反应很合——”

“Say it, idiot.”

“No matter how fucked up you are.”

“说出来，笨蛋。”

“不论你有多下贱。”

“’I’ll be your slave, I’ll do whatever you want, and my only concerns shall be for your happiness, impossible though it may be.’”

“I’ll be your slave. I’ll do whatever you want. And, uh, my only concerns shall be for your happiness, impossible though it may be.”

“‘我愿作你的奴隶，我将听命于你，我只为你的幸福考虑，哪怕它可能无法实现。’”

“我愿作你的奴隶，我将听命于你，我只为你的幸福考虑，哪怕它可能无法实现。”

She took a deep breath and released his hand.

“I’m even more pathetic than you are.”

“Asuka, I don’t think you’re pathetic.”

她深深地吸了一口气，然后松开他的手。

“我甚至比你想得还要可怜。”

“明日香，我不觉得你可怜。”

“What a pathetic thing to say. You don’t pity me?”

“No! I—I feel bad. For what I did. I pity myself, but not you.”

“Do you think I should feel bad? For what I did to you? That time?”

“真是一句悲哀的话，你都不舍得同情一下我？”

“不！我——我只是感觉很内疚。因为我做的那些事。我同情我自己，但不是你。”

“你觉得我应该内疚吗？就是那次，我对你做了那件事？”

He cocked his head to the side. “What do you mean?”

How could he not know?

他把头朝一边歪。“你是指哪件事？”

他怎么会想不起来呢？

“It’s fine. Never mind. Just don’t let your self-pitying get in the way of serving me.”

He managed a slight smile. “Whatever you want, Asuka. Can I, uh, get you anything?”

“没事。别在意。只是别让你的自我同情干涉到服务我的态度上。”

他试图挤出一个微小的笑容。“随时奉命，明日香。你需要，呃，我帮你拿些什么吗？”

“Good question. Yes, you can. I’m going to take a shower. Then, I’ll need stuff for wound care. Antiseptic. Something to numb the pain. Bandages and gauze. Petroleum jelly. Stuff like that.”

“好问题。没错，你需要。我要去洗澡了。然后，我需要一些消毒剂、止痛的药、绷带、纱布和凡士林之类的东西来处理伤口。”

“I can go to the pharmacy down the street. It might be locked, but I don’t think anyone will care if I break in.”

“Good boy,” she said. She took a breath and heaved herself to her feet. Shinji started to reach for her but she waved his hands away. “It’s fine. I can do it.”

“我可以去一趟街头的药店。药店可能锁住了，但我破窗进去应该也没人会怪我。”

“好孩子。”她说。她吸了口气，把自己撑起来。真嗣想要搀扶她，她却挥开了他的手。“不要紧，我自己可以。”

She only grimaced once or twice while crossing the room. All without his help.

“Hey, Shinji.”

“Yeah?”

“Um, my body.”

在没有真嗣的帮助下穿过房间时，她也全力克制，只是因着强烈的痛感偶尔露出扭曲的表情。

“嘿，真嗣。”

“什么事？”

“唔，我的身体。”

In spite of everything,(you got it!! yey!) his cheeks went red. He looked to see if she was making fun of him but her gaze was locked on the floor.

尽管经历了那么多，他的脸颊还是一热。他仔细望着明日香，想知道她是不是要寻乐子，但她的目光只是停留在地面上。

“What about it?”

“It’s gonna’ be different now. You saw it, right? In the hospital?”

“Um, yeah.”

“身体怎么了？”

“比以前不一样了。你看见了对吧？在医院的时候？”

“呃，是的。”

“Good. If you, uh, ever see me naked, I want you to remember that, instead of what it looks like now, okay?”

“Asuka, I’m sure—“

“好。如果你，呃，见到我光着身子，我想要你记住那个时候的样子，而不是现在的模样，懂了吗？”

“明日香，我可以肯定——”

“Shinji,” she growled. “What was our agreement?”

He bit his tongue and nodded.

“I’ll, uh, remember that, instead.”

“真嗣，”她低吼道，“我们之间的协议是什么？”

他咬住舌头，点了点头。

“我，呃，我会记住你那时的样子。”

“And we’ll pretend that’s what I look like, instead.”

“We’ll pretend. It’ll be no different.”

“Good.”

“然后我们就假装这就是我现在的模样。”

“我们就假装，跟以前一模一样。”

“这就对了。”

~

She stripped off the plug suit like peeling the skin off an over-ripe fruit. It didn’t hurt, much, but the sight of it, watching the suit tug at her sticky wounds, that was far worse than any pain. Asuka watched her body reveal itself, inch by inch, and she only realized she was crying when she saw tears dripping onto one of the long, angry red scars that ran the length of her gut.

她剥下战斗服，就像把皮从熟透的水果上剥掉。疼归疼，没那么厉害，但是看着战斗服勾拉着她黏糊糊的伤口，这景象就比任何疼痛都让她难以接受。明日香盯着身体一点一点地露出来，然后，当她见到眼泪滴落在其中一条丑恶的、横贯她脏腑的红色疮疤上，她才意识到自己哭了。

They were healing. They had almost fully healed. But they were still tender to the touch. Her arm, her legs, her stomach, and her chest were all slick with plasma,（血浆？yep, just assume plasma in biology definition here:)） pink with LCL. Scars throbbing now that the plug suit was gone.

它们在愈合。几乎要完全愈合了，但碰上去感觉还是娇嫩的。她的手臂，她的双腿，她的肚子，她的胸口全被血浆沾得打滑，被LCL染得发红。现在战斗服已经被脱去，只留下伤口在阵阵抽搐。

She should have checked that the hot water still worked. She said a silent prayer of thanks—to Rei?—when she stuck her hand under the water and found it nearly scalding. Perfect.

她应该先检查下是不是还有热水。当她把手伸到水流下，发现还挺烫手，她自心里发出了感谢的祈祷——谢丽隆恩？

The washcloth between her lips didn’t taste like anything until she bit down hard on it, and caught a chunk of her lip in her teeth.（-浴巾咬在嘴里？防止自己疼到叫出声音所以咬在嘴里） Blood, now. But that was fine. It was just a little and it took her mind off the searing pain coursing along her flesh. She closed her eyes, sighed into the wash cloth to keep from screaming, and drained soap over her body.

衔在嘴中的毛巾直到她用力咬下去之前没有任何味道，牙齿在嘴唇上割了一口子。现在有血腥味了。但还好。只有一点点，也能让她不再去想蔓延在血肉之上的灼热痛楚。她闭上眼，把叹息声埋进毛巾里，免得张口尖叫，接着把肥皂抹遍全身。

Now, she was all pink. She wrapped herself in a towel and found Shinji returning.（-肥皂没洗掉 -是的，他没有写明日香洗掉肥皂沫！！（强迫症犯了）

现在，明日香浑身都成粉色的了。她正用浴巾裹住自己，发现真嗣回来了。

“I’m back—ah, Asuka, I’ll just leave the stuff here,” he started to say when he saw her. He turned his head, a well-timed, well-honed pivot. She glanced down at her form—most of the scars were covered by the towel, but he could see how mutilated her arm was. Even her shins and feet.

“我回来了——啊，明日香，我会把这些东西放外面，”真嗣一见她就急忙说道。他在一个恰好的时机转过脑袋，活像一个精准的转轴。她往下瞥了一眼自己的形体——绝大部分的伤疤被浴巾遮住了，但他还是能看见她的手臂有多么伤痕累累，连她的小腿和足部也不能幸免。

“No, it’s fine. Come here. I need your help.”

“Okay.” His voice trembled. Ach, Shinji, right now I need a Mensch, she thought. He began to unload the pharmacy bag.

“不，没事。过来吧。我需要你的帮助。”

“好的。”他的声音在颤抖。Ach，真嗣，现在我需要一个Mensch（-德语：好人，好家伙），她想。他开始卸下医药包。

“I, uh, got everything you asked for. And new toothbrushes, since I don’t know how long it’s been. And you didn’t even use yours for the last month, uh…”

“Shinji, I meant in the bathroom. I can’t put this stuff on myself. It hurts to stretch and twist（翻译没有问题w）. Okay?”

“Okay. Yeah. Yeah, okay.”

“我，呃，把你要的全带过来了。还有新牙刷，因为我不知道旧的放了多久。而且你上个月都没有用过，嗯……”

“真嗣，我的意思是让你过来浴室。我办不到用这东西来擦自己的身体，光是拉它扯它就疼死人了。你行不行？”

“行，行，没问题。”

She took a deep breath. It felt good to fill her lungs with steam. He joined her in the bathroom and she put her hands on the edge of the towel.

“Remember what I said. About—pretending.”

“I’ll remember.”

“Thank you.”

她深吸一口气。让蒸气充满她肺部的感觉好极了。他进了浴室，她把双手放在浴巾两侧。

“记得我说的。假装。”

“我记得。”

“谢谢。”

She slid the towel down and squeezed her eyes shut. She didn’t trust the pity not to bloom on his face. She didn’t care, now, if he saw her. He’d already seen it. But to see disappointment on his face—pity—she’d throw up again if she saw that.

“Wow, Asuka,” he whispered. She heard him gulp and she gritted her teeth.

“What? What is it?”

她将浴巾轻轻滑落，紧闭上眼睛。她不信他脸上没有丝毫的怜悯。现在她不在乎他看见她的裸体。他早就见过了。但是他脸上的失望之情——或者怜悯——如果让她看见，她又会想吐的。

“哇，明日香，”他轻声说。她听见他咽唾沫的声音，便咬紧牙关。

“什么？怎么了？”

“Sorry. It’s just—you’re really, really beautiful.” Their breathing seemed to alternate, waiting for the other to take a breath before inhaling.

Don’t push it, idiot, she wanted to say, but he wasn’t done.

“Seriously, Asuka, I’m not pretending. I’ve always thought so. This doesn’t change anything.”

“对不起。只是——你真的，真的好漂亮啊。”他们的呼吸似乎都凝滞了，等待着，看谁先吸入下一口空气。

别强迫自己，笨蛋，她想这样说，但他还没完。

“我是认真的，明日香，我没有在假装。我一直都这么想。即使现在也没有任何改变。”

She bit hard into the raw slice of her lip to keep from crying. She searched his words, his voice, but could find no trace of deception. If he was pretending, he was doing a damned good job of it.

她死死地咬住两瓣凉薄的嘴唇，免得自己哭出声。她钻研他的话语，他的声音，但怎么也找不到欺骗之意。如果他是在假装，他也该死的装得太像回事了。

“Well, fine. Lucky for you then,” she said, finally, and opened her eyes. Her eye, really. He reached for the bandage over her face.

“Why didn’t you take this one off?”

“It… it hurt too much. The tape is in my hair.”

“好，行吧，算你蒙混过关。”她说，终于，把眼睛睁开了，准确说，是单只眼。他把手伸向她脸上的绷带。

“为什么你不把这个撕掉呢？”

“因……因为疼得厉害。胶带黏住了我的头发。”

“Do you want me to try?”

“Yeah.”

“你想让我试试吗？”

“好。”

His fingers were so long. Soft, slender twigs. She flinched as he touched her, some hardwired 应激反应——代指上一句的‘flinched’ reaction that she tried to kill but couldn’t. He smiled thinly.

“Sorry—I’ll be gentle.”

“You’d better.”

他的手指好修长啊，就像温柔，细长的嫩枝。他碰到她的时候，她无可自控地畏缩了一下。他挤出细微的笑。

“对不起——我会小心的。”

“最好是这样。”

She watched his face as he worked the tape off her hair. The concentration and seriousness drawn tight over the face she was so used to seeing look—sad, tired, bored, pitiful in every possible way.

他将绷带从她的头发上揭下来时，她一直盯着他的脸。那聚精会神的表情，那一板一眼的神色，覆盖在她不能再熟悉的面庞上，各种方面来说，显得既悲哀，又疲倦，既无趣，又可怜。

“How’s it look?” she asked once he peeled the bandage down, wincing yet again as it grabbed at skin.

“Not too bad—can you open it?”

“I—don’t know.”

“看上去如何？”一旦他揭下了绷带，她即刻问道，只是绷带擦到了她的皮肤，又让她畏缩了一下。

“没那么糟糕——你能睁开它吗？”

“我——不知道。”

“Here,” he said, and wet a cloth. He wiped at it for a few seconds. “Try now.”

Her eye fluttered open, as if by magic, and there he was.

“Your eyes,” he said. “They’re really pretty.”

“稍等。”他说，把一条毛巾打湿，花了几秒钟擦了擦她的眼皮。“现在试试看。”

她的眼猛地睁开，就像魔法起效一般，他的身影映入眼帘。

“你的眼睛，”他说，“真的很漂亮。”

“I know,” Asuka murmured, and snatched the wash cloth from him. She ran it over her face and looked at it—a little blood but not much. Without a word, they both turned to the mirror: the flesh around her eye was mottled pink with burns（没有问题w）, and a deep gouge in her eyebrow shimmered wet. But her eye itself was fine.

“我知道。”明日香喃喃道，从他手里夺过了湿毛巾，在脸上一抹，定睛一看——有一点血迹，但不多。没有言语，他们不约而同地转向了镜子，只见那只眼睛周围的血肉被烧灼成斑驳的红色，眼眉有一道深深的凹陷，因湿润而闪光。但眼睛本身是完好的。

He set to work on the wounds. Occasionally, it stung. Mostly, she felt nothing. She opened her eyes to see him, crouched and bent in concentration, his face mere inches from her hips. She hated how gentle he was, or wanted to hate it—how, （how=指前文中“想要去讨厌他”的办法）if he tried, he could ensure that she felt no pain. His fingers were so delicate, so skilled, playing her wounds like the cello. Even though he wasn’t a doctor, his fingers seemed to know how to help.

他着手开始处理伤口。它会偶尔刺痛。绝大多数时候，她没什么感觉。她睁开眼看他弯着身子，全神贯注，他的脸离她的臀部只有几英寸。她恨他如此温柔，或者说，她想要去恨——但是她做不到。如果他愿意尝试，他就可以确保她感觉不到疼痛。他手指的操作是如此精细，如此娴熟，在她的伤口上挥舞着，就像正在拉一手大提琴。（-真是奇妙的比喻ww-这很真嗣ww）即使他不是一名医生，他的手似乎也懂得如何医治创痛。

He knew how to help her, how to relieve her agonies, and so often, he simply hadn’t.

他懂得如何帮助她，如何缓和她强烈的苦楚。然而多数时候，他往往只是无动于衷。 ~

The torn, ruddy flesh before him glistened with jelly now. He dabbed it on, as gently as he could, somehow containing himself. Once upon a time, being this close to Asuka, his face practically pressed into her buttocks as he treated a long, jagged scar that ran the length of her leg and crossed over the plumpness of her thighs onto her lower back, he would have shut down from embarrassment.

现在他面前，被撕裂的、泛红的伤疤闪着果冻般的光泽。他尽可能动作温柔地把药涂抹上去，不知怎的竟然把持住了自己。在处理那条自她丰满的大腿横贯到下背部的长长的、锯齿状的伤疤时，他的脸蛋几乎完全陷在她的臀部中间，要是放在以前，像这样靠近明日香的身体，他会立马羞死过去。

But this world only barely felt real. She needed this, here, in this world, and he owed it to her to help her without succumbing to a nosebleed.

但是这个世界几乎感觉不到真实。她需要他的帮助，在这里，在这个世界。他欠她实在太多，克服一点鼻血只是小意思。

Besides—even thinking about her that way made him sick with guilt. Calling her beautiful was one thing—it was the truth, as far as he was concerned, but it also seemed to be what she needed, then, at that moment. A salve for scars hidden from his eyes. （-hide from？-to aviod detection by himself）But to think about her in that way, after what had happened… No, after what he’d done.（-这里似乎没有继续说下去）

而且——即便只是对她动了一分淫念，都会叫他满心羞愧，满腹欲呕。称她美丽是一回事——从他来看，这是再真切不过的事实，而且在那个时刻，她似乎也正需要这样的赞美，这样一个，为了她的伤疤而避开视线的奴隶。不对，在他做了那件事之后，还对她有那样的心思……

“I bet,” Asuka said, cutting the silence as she eased her legs apart to let him treat a wound on her inner thigh. “You’re getting off on this. My nubile naked body. All helpless and splayed open for you.”

“我打赌，”当明日香伸展她的腿，让他处理她大腿内部的伤口时，她打破沉默道，“你已经开始想入非非了。我迷人的裸体，从头到脚，全都被你一览无余。”

He bit his lip hard to keep from crying.

他咬紧嘴唇，免得哭出声音。

“No—not really,” he said.

“不——我没那么想。”他说。

“You’re lying. You said you liked my body.”

“你在撒谎。你说过你喜欢我的身体。”

“I do. I mean, I think you’re beautiful but—I’m not thinking about you like that.”

“Because you already got to try it so you’re not interested.”

“我是说过。我的意思是，我认为你很漂亮，但是——我没有往那样的方面想你。”

“因为你已经试过了，所以才没兴趣。”

“No! No, I mean, I just feel bad. And I feel bad that I’m the only one here who can take care of you. You don’t want that, do you? I wouldn’t blame you if you never wanted to see me again.”

“不！不，我是说，我只是感觉特别糟糕。我感觉糟糕是因为，我是唯一可以在这儿照顾你的人。你肯定不希望这个人是我，对吧？如果你再也不想见我，我也不会怪你的。”

“Idiot,” she whispered after a few moments. “You’re still a man, aren’t you? You aren’t imagining how much I might be enjoying a man’s hands on me?”

“Asuka,” he said. He closed his eyes and leaned his forehead against the small （背部略微靠下的位置）of her back. “What are you doing?”（-听上去像是“你为什么要诱惑我？”的无奈发言hh -哈哈哈小情侣伤还没好透就开始了（不是）

“笨蛋，”过了一会儿，她才轻声说道，“你到底也算是个男人，不是吗？你没有想象过我多少也有可能享受来自一个男人的抚摸？”

“明日香，”他说。他闭上眼睛，把额头轻轻抵在她的细背上，“你在说什么啊。”

“我不知道。”

“I don’t know.”

He finished and taped gauze to the most egregious wounds. Asuka hobbled to her room, and while she dressed, Shinji made dinner. He could hear her muttering to herself, sifting through clothes, cursing in German, even throwing things but when she emerged, she was smiling. She wore a pale blue skirt, and a sweatshirt he’d never seen, with Latin letters emblazoned over the chest—Universität Wittenberg.

他用纱布把最严重的伤口包扎完了。明日香一跛一跛地进了房间。真嗣在她换衣服的时候着手做饭。他听见她在小声自言自语，用德语咒骂，翻寻衣服，甚至扔东西，不过当她出来时，脸上却挂着微笑。她穿着淡蓝色短裙，一条他从未见过的长袖运动衫，胸口还有醒目的拉丁字母——Universität Wittenberg。

“It was hard to find something to wear with these stupid bandages, but this is kind of cute, isn’t it?” she said, and spun around, flinging the skirt up an inch.

“有这些烦人的绷带，我都不知道穿什么才好，但这件是不是还挺可爱的？”她说着还转了个圈，甩得裙子微微上扬。

“What’s it say on your sweatshirt?” Shinji asked. A shadow passed over her face—should he have complimented the skirt?

“你这件运动衫上写的是什么意思？”真嗣问。她的脸掠过一阵不满的阴影——他不应该先夸夸这件裙子吗？

“Can’t you read it? You know some English. German’s not that different.”

He tried to sound it out, and after a few tries, she took pity on him.

“你不会读一读吗？你应该知道些英语。德语也没有那么不同。”

他试图念出声，试了好几次之后，她听不下去了。

“Universität Wittenberg—that’s where I went to university. In Germany. I never wore this sweatshirt because it always seemed like summer here, but it seems like the seasons are coming back. It was colder today than I remember it being.”

“Universität Wittenberg——这是我上的大学。在德国。我从来不穿这件运动衫，因为这里好像每天都跟夏天一样热，但现在四季似乎变得正常了。今天就比我记得以前的日子要冷很多。”

“That’s right. I wonder if something about Third Impact changed things back to how they were.” Noodles sizzled in the wok as Shinji whipped tofu and soy sauce into the pan. “I remember my mother telling me about the different seasons…”

“对。我想知道是不是第三次冲击又把这天气调回来了。”面条在锅里嘶嘶作响，真嗣把豆腐和酱油迅速倒入平底锅，“我记得我妈妈跟我讲过有关不同季节的事……”

Asuka grunted. That’s right. Mothers were probably an off-limits topic with her.（大体意思没错，调整了一下表达）

明日香咕哝一声。没错。“母亲”于她而言很有可能是个禁忌的话题。

“I always forget that you graduated university,” Shinji continued. He glanced over his shoulder to see her sitting down, watching him from the dining room table. His shoulders tensed for a second, remembering that horrible dream, but her head wasn’t bowed—she looked at him, and she didn’t seem mad. “There’s really a lot I don’t know about you, Asuka.”

“我总是忘记你已经大学毕业了。”真嗣继续说。他回头看到她坐下来，在餐厅桌的另一端朝他对望。他的肩膀绷紧了一秒，记起了那个可怕的梦，但此时她并没有垂着头——她正看着他，似乎也没有生气。“明日香，我真的还有很多不了解你的地方。”

“Maybe I’d like to keep it that way, Third Child.”

His shoulders slumped.

“I guess I don’t blame you.”

“也许我就没想让你了解，第三适格者。”

他的肩膀耷拉下来。

“我猜我不会怪你。”

He divided the noodles between two bowls. The produce in the fridge had gone bad, and he started to apologize that there wouldn’t be any fresh vegetables but the look on Asuka’s face told him she wouldn’t want to hear it.

他把面条分到了两个碗里。冰箱里的食材已经变质了，他欲张口为没有任何新鲜蔬菜而道歉，但明日香脸上的表情警告他，她并不想听到这个词。

“Let’s eat,” he said softly. She said nothing, merely dipping into （这个词主要体现的是她只从碗里夹起一点点）the noodles and piloting them to her mouth.

“I hope it’s okay,” he tried again.

“那就开动吧。”他轻声说。她没说话，只是撩起一小筷子面条然后送进嘴里。

“我希望味道还行。”他又试着说。

Finally, he couldn’t resist any longer—

“I’m sorry we don’t have any fresh vegetables—“

最后，他再也憋不住了——

“对不起，我们没有新鲜的蔬菜了—”

“How could that possibly be your fault?” Her voice grabbed him by the throat and he sputtered.

“I just mean…”

“那怎么可能是你的错？”像被掐住了脖子，她的声音让他窒息。他结巴地说道：“我只是想说……”

“Pathetic.”

He bowed his head.

“Just be nice to me.”

“I am nice to you.”

“真可怜。”

他垂下头。

“对我温柔一点吧。”

“我已经对你很温柔了。”

That was from—when they were in that place.他想对照的应该是eoe里两人正面冲突的镜头 He looked up at her to see her mouth dropping open. The look of hatred he’d expected was absent—she was… startled. Eyes wide. Lip trembling. She dropped her chop sticks into the bowl and he let loose a little yelp when she reached for his hand. If that had surprised him, the way his fingers responded to the warmth without question, intertwining them with hers, caught him even more off-guard.

这正是——基于先前在这里所发生的事。他抬起头，看见她的嘴巴大张。她脸上的表情不复从前，没有他预料的那般仇恨，而是……惊奇。双目圆睁。双唇轻颤。她把筷子扔进碗里，他惊叫一声，因为她握住了他的手。仅仅是这样已经够让他意想不到了，更让他意想不到的是，他的手指竟然毫不犹豫地回应了这份温暖，与她的手指相互交缠。

“We’re really the last two people on Earth who should be the last two people on Earth,” he said.

“我们，是最不该活在世界上的两个人，却恰恰同时活在了这个世界上。”他说。

They finished in silence. Asuka wouldn’t let go of his hand. Finally, he eased his fingers away to clean up but she caught him again.

他们安静地结束了话题。明日香不愿放开他的手。终于，他的手松开退去，但她又抓住了他。

“Hey,” she said. She wasn’t smiling, but there was something in her eyes like a grin. “Let’s go get drunk and kill this thing inside of me.”（-这句话有什么惯用翻译吗？我想这句话想得脑子快凸了 -我理解的thing是指“世界上只剩下两人”，然后明日香想借喝醉来遗忘这个事实）

“嘿，”她说。她没有笑，但她的眼睛似乎在笑。“咱们出门去，喝到不醉不归，把这些烂事彻底忘个一干二净。”

~

There was a basement bar a block from their building. They had both walked by it far too many times to count—the kind of sleazy place bored-looking women in short dresses always seemed to be waiting outside of. Misato mentioned once that she’d gotten kicked out of, and Shinji even remembered Ritsuko teasing her about it. In other words, it was the perfect place to drink yourself stupid post-apocalypse.

离他们的家一个街区的地方，有个地下酒吧。他们从前不知经过了多少次——那个身穿短裙，神情慵懒的女人总是会在这个不怎么正经的地方外头等客。美里提到过她曾有一次大醉酩酊，被赶了出来，真嗣甚至记得律子还拿这件事取笑了她。换句话说，想要把自己灌醉，以忘记愚蠢的世界末日，此地为最佳去处。

The door was unlocked. Most doors were, it seemed. They exchanged knowing looks.

门没锁。街上大部分的门似乎都这样。他们交换了个眼神。

“It must have been open when Third Impact happened,” Asuka wondered aloud as Shinji eased the door open. A thick cloud of dust gasped about them as they stepped inside. Briefly, she wondered if this was a terrible, horrible mistake: the bar was littered with damp clothes, the remnants of the last patrons. Half-evaporated drinks stood bearing lonely witness to the end of the world. The entire place smelled vaguely of fruit juice and syrup.

“在第三次冲击发生的时候，这里肯定还在营业。”明日香思忖着，真嗣慢慢地推开了门。他们一踏入里面，就被一团厚厚的灰尘呛住了。有那么一瞬间，她想着他们是不是犯了个糟糕透顶、荒谬绝伦的错误：这酒吧里，潮湿的衣物摊得到处都是，客人们的私人物品散落一地。只剩下酒杯子孤零零地竖着，装的液体被蒸发了大半，也算是见证了世界末日。整个地方弥漫着果汁和糖浆的气味。

Shinji glanced back at her and whatever the face she had been making, she replaced it with a resolute frown.

“What are you waiting for, idiot? I said I wanted you to make me a cocktail and Misato only had cheap beer!”（-这边的句子前后关系是？-为了强调她要的是鸡尾酒，你翻得没问题哈哈哈哈）

真嗣回瞥了明日香一眼，不管刚才她的脸上有什么怪表情，现在她都打算坚定地皱起眉头加以掩饰。

“你还在等什么，笨蛋？我说想让你给我弄杯鸡尾酒，不是尽喝那些美里的廉价啤酒！”

“You don’t think it’s—creepy?”

“Everything’s creepy. There’s no where we can go that won’t be like this. Did you think I just wanted to sit at home with you all night?”

“你不觉得——这个地方很可怕吗？”

“哪儿都一样可怕。我们能去的地方，没有一家不长这样。你觉得我会想要一整晚都和你在家里傻坐着吗？”

Somehow, even as she said it, the way she phrased that made her blush. Home. Why did that word taste so odd?

不知怎的，即便她能说出这个词，但表达的方式还是让她感到害羞——家，为什么这个字眼听上去这么奇特呢？

Shinji stepped behind the bar. He brushed the dust away from a few bottles and coughed.

真嗣绕到吧台后面。他拂去几个瓶子上面的灰尘，咳嗽了一声。

“Um, I don’t really know anything about cocktails, Asuka.”

“Fine. Then, I’d like to start with a good German beer.”

“呃，我真的对调酒一窍不通，明日香。”

“行吧。那...先给我来杯上好的德国啤酒。”

“Um,” he said, squatting down and digging into a fridge. “There’s… Heineken.”

“Dummkopf! That’s not German. It’s Dutch.”

“What’s the difference?”

“呃，”他蹲下，一头钻到冰箱里，“这里有……Heineken。”

“Dummkopf!（德语：笨蛋）不是德国产的。那是荷兰语。”

“有什么区别吗？”

She rose on her heels, over the bar, only to see him grinning at her. She snatched the green bottle out of his hand, and then gave it back when she realized she had no opener. He poured two bottles and they raised their glasses.

她踮着脚跟，趴到吧台上，只见他对她咧嘴笑。她从他手里抓过绿色的瓶子，发现自己没开瓶器，又给还回去了。他倒了两杯出来，然后共同举杯。

“In German, you say ‘Prost!’ for cheers,” she instructed. “Eins, zwei, drei…”

“在德国，你要干杯的时候会说‘Prost’！”她示意道，“Eins,zwei,drei……”（德语：一、二、三……）

Asuka had only had beer a few times, but she wasn’t about to let Shinji know that. The flavor—crisp, malty, but too bitter—almost made her gag, but she forced a gulp down, and then another, and by the time her glass was halfway drunk, she’d started to enjoy the taste.

明日香只喝过几次酒，但她不打算让真嗣知道。这酒味——清新的，混着麦芽香，但是太苦了——差点让她噎住，但她硬是咽了下去，然后又猛吞了第二口，到她的杯子被喝了一半时，她已经开始享受这味道了。

“You’re—drinking that fast.”

“I guess Misato rubbed off on me（-be adopted by Misato, then Asuka has her mannerisms/ characteristics).”

“你喝得太快了啦。”

“我猜是受了美里的影响。”

“You’ll make yourself sick if you drink too fast,” he tried one last time. A withering look was her only reply. “But that’s what you’re trying to do.”

“要是喝得这么快，你会想吐的。”他最后试着劝了一次。她只是剜了他一眼。“不过你本来就打算这么干。”

“Obviously. And you’re getting sick with me.” She tipped the rest of the beer back（把剩下的酒几口就喝掉的意思ww *tip back专门用来形容豪饮，特别是酒精一类）, with a few steady gulps and let out a mighty belch. She hadn’t been expecting that, but she found she rather liked the stunned expression on Shinji’s face. “Next. Surprise me.”

“当然。而且你也得陪我一起醉。”她把剩下的半瓶酒也倒进嘴里，稳稳地咽了几口，打了个响亮的嗝。她没料到自己会这样，但是能看见真嗣脸上震惊的表情，她觉得也还不赖。“下一杯。给我来点惊喜。”

A dust bound book caught Shinji’s eye. He palmed it open, squinted in the dim light, and found the table of contents. The first recipe was complicated, but it seemed impressive and sophisticated—something she’d like. A quick perusal of the bottles behind the bar revealed that he had all the ingredients at hand.

一本尘封的书吸引了真嗣的注意力。他用手掌翻开，在昏暗的灯光下眯起眼睛，找到了目录。第一个配方就很复杂，但似乎精致，高端，上档次——是她会喜欢的。他很快地扫过吧台后面的瓶瓶罐罐，发现他要的所有原料都齐全。

“Okay—give me a moment,” he said, taking another gulp of his beer. Asuka watched him work. He brought care to what he did, treating it like piloting an Eva or playing the cello or making her dinner. Three things, she reminded herself, that he did exceedingly well. Would this be a fourth?

“好吧——给我一点时间。”他说着，又喝了一口他的啤酒。明日香看着他开始干活。他干这活就跟开Eva，拉大提琴，给她做晚饭一样投入。这三件事，她提醒自己，他都做得很漂亮。还会有第四件吗？

No. Thinking like that was dangerous.

Why, she asked herself, was it dangerous?

不。往那个方面去想是很危险的。

为什么，她心想，为什么危险？

Because it would be so easy to end up hating one another. You should really hate him, for what he did to you. And if he doesn’t hate you now—he will before long—because everyone, Asuka, everyone ends up hating you. Why would he stay in this world, heavy with guilt, with you? He could plop back into that lake of souls and merge with Wondergirl and never feel anything and you’d be all alo—

因为很容易会落得憎恨对方的下场。你真应该恨他，为他对你做的这些事。如果他现在不恨你——他很快也会的——因为每个人，明日香，每个人到最后都会恨你。为什么他宁可背负着愧疚，和你一同待在这个世界？他大可以一头栽回到那个灵魂的湖里去，和优等生融为一体，和负罪感说再见，而你呢，从此孑然一身——

“Okay, Asuka,” Shinji chirped. “Try it.”

“好了，明日香，”真嗣轻语道，“试试看。”

A glowing purple drink stood before her. She eyed it like the secretion of some ancient beast, resurrected for treachery.（-感觉遭到了背叛？ -拿来形容这个ancient beast的hhhh）

“What am I looking at?”

在她面前立着一杯发光的紫色液体。她盯着它，就像这是某种因受到背叛而苏醒的某种古代野兽的分泌物。

“我看到的是什么？”

“It’s called an Abi—Avi—Aviash—“

“Aviation?”

“That’s it. My English is rusty.”

“这叫Abi-Avi-Aviash——”

“Aviation?”

“是的。我英语很烂。”

“You didn’t poison me, did you?” She raised the drink to her lips. There was something witchy and beautiful about the amethyst pond, which seemed to move in its glass as one, leaving no traces of itself behind.（-what’s this thing？-我试着翻了这一整句，可以看看有没有make sense）

“你该不会是想毒死我吧？”她把杯子举到唇边。这潭美丽的紫晶色液体看起来像是某种巫术的残留，在杯中浑然一体，不留下任何拖曳的痕迹。

“N-no! I know it looks weird, but it says here the ingredients are usual. ‘Crème de violette’ and gin…”

“Gin,” she said, swirling it once last time. “Like a martini.”

“怎-怎么会！我知道它看上去很怪异，但这上面写着的原料都很常见。‘Crème de violette’ and gin…”（-一种花香型的甜酒，以紫罗兰为原料）

“Gin（-杜松子酒？），”她说，最后把酒杯晃了一次，“类似马提尼酒。”

“I guess. I don’t really know much about alcohol. I’ve had sake （sake=清酒）at funerals and I swiped a beer from Misato once or twice but that’s it. Until tonight.”

“大概吧。我真的对酒没多少了解。只是在以前参加过的葬礼上喝过清酒，然后偷喝过一两次美里小姐的啤酒，再就是今晚。

As she spoke, she took a sip. How could something taste so smooth—so bitter and sweet at once? She let it play on her tongue for a second before swallowing.

“You stole beer from Misato?” she choked. “Why didn’t you tell me? That would have made living with her way more fun.”

他说的时候，她啜了一小口。怎么能有一样东西尝起来既滑溜——又苦，还甜？她在舌头上逗留了一秒钟，才咽下去。

“你从美里那里偷啤酒？”明日香呛了一下，“为什么你不告诉我？告诉我的话，还能让我们和她同居的生活多点乐子呢。”

“Well, it was only a few times and I didn’t really like it that much. And I didn’t think you’d want to do that.” He scratched his head like a little boy admitting to some minor wrongdoing—which, now that she thought about it （现在她确实在考虑做些这样的事了！）, was exactly what he was. “Hang out with me, like that. And drink.”

“嗯，只有几次啦，而且我不怎么喜欢。另外我不知道你也想要那么做。”他搔着脑袋瓜，就像个小男孩承认一些常识性的错误——而她现在恰恰开始考虑做些这种事了。“约我出去玩，像这样，然后喝酒。”

“We hung out all the time at home,” she said and took another sip. And another. “We watched TV and played video games and read…”

“我们就整天在家里玩。”她说着又啜了一口，再一口。“我们看电视，打游戏（口语化一点），看书……”

“But we didn’t really do any of that stuff together. We read manga and stuff, but side by side and we didn’t really talk. Or we argued over what we’d watch and you always won. Or I watched you play video games. When I did things with Touji and Kensuke… We, you know, talked about them and did them together. Camping and stuff.” Something on her face must have scared him because he added, almost immediately: “Sorry.”

“但我们真没有一起做过什么事。我们看漫画，或别的书，但都是自顾自的，没什么交流。或者就是为自己想看的节目而争吵不休，你每次都是赢家。或者就是我看着你打游戏。当我和东治和剑介一起……我们，你知道的，我们会商讨计划，合作完成。野营之类的。” 她脸上的表情一定把他吓着了，因为他几乎，条件反射地加了一句：“对不起。”

“Idiot,” she scowled. “You could have… said something. I didn’t exactly have a normal childhood. If I was weird—it was probably because I wasn’t used to spending a lot of time with someone.”

“笨蛋，”她绷着脸说，“你本来可以……说点什么。我的童年和正常人不太一样。如果我表现得很奇怪——可能是因为我不习惯花很多时间和别人待在一起。”

“It’s okay. Really. I didn’t mind.”

“No, you brought it up, so you clearly did mind!” she said, voice rising. “If you had just told me, maybe I could have fixed and maybe we could have—“ Something caught in her voice. She frowned, forcing the tremble in her lip to cease, and pressed the rim of the cocktail glass to her mouth. Cool ethanol oblivion （以几乎无法感受到液体存在的速度喝下去了）washed over her tongue.

“没关系。真的。我不介意。”

“不，你都明着提出来了，所以你肯定很在意！”她提高了音量，“如果你跟我提了，也许我就可以搞定这个问题，也许我们就可以……”有什么卡住了她的声音。她皱起眉，强行止住了嘴唇的颤抖，用鸡尾酒的玻璃杯边缘压住嘴巴。冰凉的酒精几乎毫无感触地洗润了她的舌头。

He took another sip of his beer, and then a gulp. He burped behind his hand and opened another bottle.

“It would have been nice, right?” he ventured. “If we had been friends.”

他也啜了一口自己的啤酒，然后咽下。他用手掩着打了个嗝，打开了另一瓶。

“本来可以顺顺利利的，对吧？”他壮起胆子说，“如果我们是朋友的话。”

“God knows Wondergirl wasn’t great company. Hikari was great, and your idiot friends were okay, but it’s not like they understood.”

“Ayanami had it rough,” he countered. “I don’t think she knew what to make of things until the very end. They really kept her in the dark about everything they were doing.”

“老天知道优等生是个差劲的同伴。小光呢挺好，你的笨蛋朋友们也不赖，但他们都不理解我们。”

“绫波只知道个大概，”他插话道，“我觉得直到最后她才知道明白怎么做。他们的计划全都在暗中进行，把她瞒得死死的。”

“But she didn’t have to be so—so—smug. Even now, I feel like she’s smirking at me. Like she knows something I don’t.”

“但她也不用这么——这么——自鸣得意吧。即使现在，我还是感觉她在朝我坏笑。就像她还知道什么秘密。”

“She probably does. Not that it matters.”

Asuka finished her drink, and Shinji made her another. Drunkenness was descending, and it felt wonderful—a warm coat that made her impervious to anything and everything she might say. He might say. Anything.

“也许她是知道。不过那不重要。”

明日香喝光了她的酒，真嗣又给她倒了一杯。酒醉的晕眩感正在退去，现在她感觉特别好——像一件温暖的外套，让她能肆意地倾吐任何事，并且不在乎他想说的。任何话。

“We could have been friends,” she repeated, nodding. He nodded too.

“We should have been friends.”

“I would have liked that.”

“我们本来可以做朋友的。”她不住地点头重复。他也颔首同意。

“我们肯定能成为朋友。”

“我也许会很喜欢和你做朋友。”

“Really?”

“Obviously, idiot! You must be really brain dead. I was—“ And here, she pulled the cloak of alcohol tight around her vulnerable flesh. “—flirting with you all the time. I thought you weren’t interested.” She let the words settle on his stunned face. “I thought you liked Wondergirl more.”

“真的？”

“当然啦，笨蛋！你的脑袋肯定是木头做的。我——”到这儿，她把酒精的外衣紧紧裹住自己脆弱的内心，“——无时无刻不在和你调情。我以为你只是对我不感兴趣。”她让这句话沉落到他愕然的脸上。“我以为你更喜欢优等生。”

“No way.”

“For real.”

“You’re making this up. What about—what about—the ‘impenetrable wall of Jericho’ and all that stuff?”

“不可能。”

“是真的。”

“你在乱编。关于——关于——‘无法逾越的耶利哥之墙’，还有别的那些，你怎么说？”

“Shinji,” she said, setting her glass down. “Do you know what’s so special about the wall of Jericho?”

“真嗣啊，”她说，把她的杯子放下，“你知道耶利哥之墙为什么这么特别吗？”

“Um—it’s really strong and—impenetrable?”

“So they thought. But, in scripture, God helps the Israelites…“—and here she made sure to emphasize each syllable—“…PEN-E-TRATE it. It falls. That’s what people know about it.”

“嗯——因为它非常坚硬——坚不可摧？”

“所以那些造墙的人也这么想。但是，根据经文，上帝帮助以色列人……”这里她为了强调，特地加重了每个音节——“……攻 破 了 它。它倒了。这才是人们会记住它的原因。”

Shinji hung his head. Asuka couldn’t help but giggle.

“And thermal expansion? Do you think I really cared about your grades? Do you think if I did, I’d be explaining things to you with my tits? Or what I’d ‘accidentally’ fall into bed with you?”

真嗣丧气地低下头。明日香忍不住发笑。

“还有热膨胀，你以为我真会关心你的学习成绩吗？如果我真的关心，你觉得我会一边晃着奶子一边跟你解释吗？还有，我真是‘一不小心’才睡到你床上的吗？”

“I thought that was just—how you were.”

“And I thought you were a normal, healthy teenage boy and you’d try something.” She sighed. “I guess you did. Just not when I needed it.”

“我以为那只是——你的行事作风。”

“我以为你是个正常的、健康的青春期男孩，我以为你总会尝试做点什么。”她叹息，“我猜你做了。只是没在我需要的时间。”

“I’m sorry. I—I—I can’t believe how badly I screwed up, Asuka.”

“I don’t want to hear it. It just sucks.（我很喜欢你这个翻法哈哈哈哈）”

“I know.”

“对不起。我——我——我没法相信我居然把事情搞砸成这样，明日香。”

“我不想听见这个词。顶不上一个屁用。”

“我知道。”

“We could have been something.” There was something wet in his eyes that she focused on, even though she wanted to look away.

“I would have liked that, Asuka. I was—so lonely and confused. I just thought you couldn’t possibly be interested in me.”

“我们本来可以创造更美好的关系。”他的眼睛有什么湿润了，尽管很想挪开目光，她依然定睛凝视。

“我情愿那样，明日香。我是——那么孤单和困惑。我只是以为你不可能对我感兴趣。”

“That’s your problem,” she said, thrusting her drink at his face. “You can’t even imagine being loved by someone else, so you don’t even consider that someone else might need your love!” As soon as she said it, she wanted to take it back. If she could have, she would have gathered up the words that had come tumbling out of her lips and force them back down her gullet but words spoken can’t be unheard. （-太绕了！-草，我大声朗读了三遍才想明白该怎么翻，you got it!!）This was another entropy （这里我想了很久，虽然熵值这个词没有错，但是总觉得有点生硬...? 用英文解释entropy的话是‘lack of order or predictability; gradual into discounter’）you couldn’t reverse.

“那是你的问题。”她说着把杯子往他脸上一戳，“你甚至不能想象被人爱的感觉，所以你也想不到竟然有人需要你的爱！”她话一出口，就想收回去。如果她能收回这未经推敲打磨就脱口而出的话语，也就能把这些全都随着酒精咽下肚去，可惜某人带着耳朵。这也是另一个事件无可避免地走向失败与混乱的例子。

Shinji seemed, suddenly, very interested in the bubbles dancing in his beer. She was about to yell at him, probably forbid him from pitying her, when he interrupted the panicked thoughts forming themselves into words in her mind.

“We could have been in love.”

真嗣似乎，突然对他啤酒里跃动的泡泡发生了兴趣。她欲冲他大喊，可能想让他别再同情她了，就在那时，他打断了她脑海里纷乱仓皇的思绪和涌到嘴边的话语。

“我们本来可以相爱。”

Whatever he could have said at that moment—nothing could have cut like that. （翻对了！！yey!!）

“Yeah. We could have.”

“That sucks.”

世界上再也没有第二种方式，像他现在说出这句话那样，让她的想法骤然改变。

“是啊。我们本来可以的。”

“真要命。”

“We could have been there for each other.”

“Throughout the entire stupid Third Impact. Nerv. Human Instrumentality. Everything my dad was doing. It would have been so different if I’d had someone to—to—rely on.”

“我们本来可以守护对方的。”

“整个愚蠢的第三次冲击。还有Nerv，还有人类补完计划。我爸策划的一切。期间要是有个人可以让我——依靠的话，事情就大不一样了。”

“Mein Gott, Shinji, think about it,” she said, leaning forward, smiling. “If we’d been in love. We would have been unstoppable.”

“Mein Gott（德语：老天啊）,真嗣，想想看，”她说，往前倾身，露出一抹微笑，“如果那时我们彼此相爱的话，就能所向披靡了。”

“You think so?”

“你真这么想？”

“Oh, obviously! The one time my Synch rate was perfect was when I, uh, realized that my mother was with me, you know. I think the big flaw in the EVA project was who they found to pilot them. They really found the most screwed up kids possible, didn’t they? If we’d been in a loving, supportive relationship the whole time…” She mimed a rocket taking off with her drink in tow. “Synch rates through the roof. We’d have kicked every Angel’s ass, no questions asked. You’d have saved my ass when SEELE came after NERV. And then, we would have crushed NERV, SEELE, and the UN.”

“The UN too?”

“嚄，当然咯！我唯一一次同步率达到满分，是我，嗯，发现母亲一直都在我身边，你知道是什么意思。我觉得EVA计划里最致命的弱点就是他们找的驾驶员。他们总是尽可能找那些精神最有缺陷的小孩，不是吗？如果我们俩自始至终处在一种互相扶持的恋爱关系，”她猛地提起杯子，模拟火箭一飞冲天，“同步率就能时时爆表。我们能把每个使徒揍得落花流水，压根没有悬念。当SEELE到NERV本部砸场子时，你可以耍个英雄救美。然后，我们就能齐心协力把NERV,SEELE和整个联合国一窝端了。”

“联合国也？”

“Definitely. Definitely the UN too. Because then we’d take over the world. Think about it, Shinji. The EVAs are practically gods. We would have been invincible. We could have averted all of this and made sure peace and prosperity reigned forever and ever.” Understanding flashed on his face and he gave her the saddest smile she’d ever seen anyone make.

“那是当然。怎么能放过联合国。只要搞垮它我们就能接管世界了。想一想，真嗣。EVA本来都是神一般的存在。我们本来可以所向无敌。我们本来可以避免这一切的失控，确保世界和平，经济繁荣，直到永永远远。”他的脸闪过了理解的神色，他冲她露出了她从来没有在他人脸上见过的悲伤表情。

“When you put it that way—I almost believe we could have done it.”

“You bet your ass（=absolutely certain that something will happen） we could have. We would have been unstoppable.”

“We could have been in love,” he repeated.

“你这样夸夸其谈的时候——我都差点相信我们真的可以办到了。”

“你应该说：‘我可以肯定我们能办到’。我们本来可以所向披靡！”

“我们本来可以在爱里徜徉。”他跟着说。

“But, now,” she said and finished her drink. She knocked her knuckles against the bar. “We never will be. Next.”

“但是，现在，”她说着把酒一饮而尽，用手指关节敲了敲吧台。“我们永远不可能了。下一杯。”

The night deteriorated rapidly after that.

很快，夜幕沉沉地坠了下来。

“Here, look,” she said, dabbing a drop of maraschino syrup onto her cheek and tucking the bottom two thirds of her hair into her sweatshirt. “Who am I?”

Shinji’s eyes wavered for a second.

“Dr. Akagi!”

“快看，”她蘸了一滴马拉斯加樱桃酒到脸颊上，把下沿以上三分之二的头发塞进她的运动衫里，“猜猜我是谁？”

真嗣眼珠子一转。

“赤木博士！”

“And now who am I?” She mussed up her hair, pushing some of it forward over her face, and drew her lips thin and straight. She stared at Shinji, unblinking.

“Ayanami?”

“Right! You do one.”

“那现在我又是谁呢？”她弄乱头发，把其中一些捋到前额上方，嘴唇抿得细而直。她盯着真嗣，眼睛一眨不眨。

“绫波？”

“对了！你来整一个。”

As if in a daze, he searched the bar. A huddled mound of clothing a few seats down from them provided his inspiration: he plucked the pair of glasses, still slick with LCL, from the remnants of their own, and donned them. He leaned his elbows forward on the bar, joined his hands, and let his face rest against them.

Asuka let out a gasp.

晕晕乎乎的，他扫视着吧台。几张座椅外，一堆形若土墩的衣物给了他灵感：他从那些人的遗物中间翻找出一副仍然滴着LCL汁水的眼镜，然后带上它。他的胳膊肘向前抵住台面，手指交叉，把脸倚在中间。

明日香倒吸一口气。

“Commander Ikari. You look just like him when you do that.”

“I mean,” Shinji said, discarding the glasses. “I am his son. Was his son. I don’t know what I am.”（-怎么翻？）

Asuka’s glass was empty and she knocked against the bar once more. Shinji scratched through the bar book.（-刮穿了？应该是指动作胡乱随意？）

“How about a Boulevardier?”

“是碇司令。你简直和他是从一个模子里刻出来的。”

“我想说，”真嗣说着丢掉眼镜，“我是他的儿子，从前是。现在就不知道了。”

明日香的酒杯子已经空了，她又敲了敲吧台。真嗣随意地扫了一眼酒吧菜单。“Boulevardier如何？”

Their bodies blazed in spite of themselves on the long stagger home. Asuka stripped her sweatshirt off, wrapped it around her waist, and leaned against his arm.

“I feel gross,” she grumbled for the second time that day. “This stupid thing inside of me had better die.”

Shinji slurred something and she scowled. Leave it to him to disappear into drunkenness when she needed him. At least he was reasonably steady.（-她需要他的时候，他也醉得头脑发昏。至少他走路还算稳定。——这个意思？）

回家的路漫漫，他们浑身发烫，不胜酒力，走得磕磕绊绊。明日香把运动衫扯下来，裹在她的腰间，靠在他的手臂上。

“真恶心。”她是同一天里第二次抱怨这句话，“但愿心里的倒霉事早点烟消云散才好。”

真嗣含糊不清地说了什么，她绷紧了脸。

“Asuka, look,” he said suddenly, clear as day. She froze and turned with him. They stood before two benches, a bannister, and then a drop-off. There, months ago, had been city, and here, they had once stood. The night she ran out on the impromptu party where Touji, Kensuke, and Hikari had watched Rei beat her in that stupid choreographed dance. Shinji had come to find her, had stayed with her. Laughed and traded jokes, timid though he was, with her. Agreed to work hard with her. She had mounted one of these benches, declared her intention to win for all the world to hear—though, in fact, it had just been Shinji. “Remember this place?”（-结合这里的描述，感觉那个场景又甜了一倍）

“明日香，快看，”他的声音忽然朗朗如白昼。她身子一僵，和他一样转头。他们站在两条长凳，一面扶栏，和一道陡坡前面。数月前，城市依旧，他们曾在此处逗留。那天傍晚，东治，剑介和小光在他们家开即兴派对，他们目睹了丽在那次愚蠢的编排好的舞蹈练习中打败了她，所以她一气之下离家而去。真嗣找到她，一直陪着她。即使腼腆如真嗣，也会和她打趣说笑，并答应会跟她一起努力。她爬到其中一条长椅上，向世界人民宣告了她要赢的决心——虽然，其实，在场的只有真嗣而已。

“你记得这个地方吗？”

“Of course I remember this spot,” she scowled. “I might be drunk but I still—I still—“

Something inside of her changed. She dashed to the railing, jerked her head over it, and vomited. Shinji was quick to grab her hair, bundling it into a fist. He regarded her for a second with dull eyes before her, too, threw his head over the railing.（-?）

“我当然记得了，”她气鼓鼓地说，“我可能喝醉了，但我还是能——还是能——”

在她体内，有什么东西搅动起来。她冲到栏杆边，把头猛地伸出去，开始呕吐。真嗣赶紧抓住她的头发，攥得紧紧的。前一秒他还呆呆地凝视着她，后一秒，她 也猛地把头伸到栏杆外面，吐了起来。

Somewhere in between volleys of stomach acid, he began to laugh.

“What’s so funny?” she demanded through tears, her throat hoarse.

“Asuka, we’re so stupid. Why did we get drunk? We could just get medication for you from the pharmacy.”

才吐了半肚子的酸水，他就笑了。

“有什么好笑的？”她质问道，尽管她眼泪花花，喉咙沙哑。

“明日香，我们真傻。我们为什么非得醉成这样呢？明明可以去药店里给你找点药的。”

“Idiot, you don’t think I knew that?” she screamed. Her head went back over the railing and soon, she was laughing too. “Mein Gott, we are so stupid, aren’t we?”

“笨蛋，你以为我不知道吗？”她喊道。把头搁回到栏杆上面，她也开始跟着笑起来。“Mein Gott,我们真的傻到家了。”

“We’re idiots.”

“We’re the dumbest. I could’ve taken a pill and we could be relaxing at home right now.”

“We’re so dumb.” Shinji’s throat made a sound somewhere between that of a dying car and a dying elephant. “Why did we get so drunk?”

“It was my idea. I’m an idiot.”

“我们都是笨蛋。”

“我们是笨蛋中的极品。本来只要吞个药片下去，就可以安安心心回家睡大觉了。”

“我们真的好蠢啊。”真嗣的嗓音好像一台快废掉的老爷车，或是一头快死掉的大象。“为什么要喝得这么醉呢？”

“我出的主意，所以我是笨蛋头子。”

“It’s okay. I’m the idiot who followed you.”

This was admittedly terrible but, Asuka realized, it was not the worst she’d ever felt.

“Hey, Shinji, you know what’s worse than this?”

“What?”

“没关系。我是你的笨蛋属下。”（-稍微意译咯）

确实太烂了，但是呢，明日香意识到，她已经经历过比这糟糕百倍千倍的事了。

“嘿，真嗣，你知道有什么比这更糟糕的吗？”

“什么？”

“Getting raped by your friend after having a mental breakdown, and then getting dismembered by giant robot monsters because your friend was too much of a coward to come and save you!”

Shinji wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and looked at her. She forced herself to look at him, even as she felt something suspicious dribbling down her chin.

“You—“ he started, swallowed, and continued: “Think I’m your friend?”

“你在精神崩溃的时候，被你的朋友给侵犯了；之后，你还被一群机器怪兽分尸，只因为那个朋友是胆小鬼，甚至提不起勇气来救你！”

真嗣用手背捂住嘴，怔怔地看着明日香。她强迫自己和他对视，即使她感觉有什么可疑的东西顺着下巴往下滴。（-这是指说漏了嘴，还是单纯的呕吐物？）

“你——”他张口，吞了口唾沫，又继续道：“你把我当你的朋友了？”

Her mouth dropped open another inch as they stared at each other. Then, like a storm breaking a heatwave, laughter overtook them. In unison, they dove their heads over the railing once more and hurled.

她的嘴巴又张大了一点，两人你看我，我看你。然后，就像一场暴风雨扫荡了热浪，笑声主宰了他们的世界。像是互相约好似的，两人再一次把头伸到栏杆外，把剩下的苦闷感吐了个干净。（-修改的时候，对应上面“暴风雨扫荡了热浪”，又意译了一下x） ~

It seemed like the least he could do and yet, it felt like one of the hardest things he’d ever done.

这似乎是他所有做过的事中最容易的，却又是最难的一件。

The next morning, Shinji awoke from troubled dreams to find Asuka drooling spit and vomit （-口水和呕吐物？）on his chest, a leg thrown over his body and her arms wrapped tight around his midsection. Her arms pinned his left arm, while her shoulders and head pinned his other beneath her. In other words, he was holding her and anyone coming upon them, with no prior knowledge of their relationship, would have seen two young lovers, sloppy and alive with infinite futures animated before them.

第二天早晨，真嗣从纷纷扰扰的梦境里醒来，看见明日香吐在他胸口上的残渣。她还在淌口水，一条腿甩在他身上，双手紧紧圈住他的肚腩。她的两条胳膊抵在他的左手臂上，她的肩膀和脑袋又抵在他另一侧。言下之意是，他抱住了她。任何人撞着他们，如果对两人的关系一无所知，准会以为是一对年轻的恋人，庸雅而恣意，在他们面前尚有无限生气的未来。

But, that’s not what Shinji felt. He had the vague notion that his mouth had been replaced by one of the ash trays at NERV HQ, and he was convinced that someone had bludgeoned him half to death in the middle of the night. It was only when he extracted （使分心）himself from Asuka’s embrace and examined his skull, finding no wound, that he realized it was just the worst headache he’d ever experienced.

但是，那可不是真嗣当时的感受。他有个模糊的概念，好像自己的嘴被调换成了NERV总部的其中一盘烟灰缸，并且十分确信半夜里有人一棒子把他打得不省人事。只有当他从明日香的怀抱里分出心思，检查自己的头盖骨发现并没有钝伤时，他才意识到这其实是他所经历过的最剧烈的头疼。

There was something comforting, he realized, in this. Somehow, the world held cruel possibilities that the EVAs and the Angels had not yet introduced him to. Life went on after Instrumentality, and it got worse, but—did he dare think it? Maybe that meant it could get better too.

不过还是有舒服的地方，他想。不知怎的，那个充斥着EVA和使徒们的世界好像还没打算拉他回去。在人类补完以后，生活更为艰辛，但是——容他如此作想：那也意味着日子能过得更加轻松。

He struggled to his feet. He washed his face and drank water until his stomach seemed to swell. Using his hand to keep the world from spinning, he guided himself to the door and then to the elevator—it was some small brilliant piece of providence that those elevators still worked.

他挣扎着起床，去洗了把脸，水喝到肚子发胀。他用双手保持住平衡，免得世界天旋地转，慢慢地挪到门口，然后是电梯间——真是不幸中的万幸，电梯仍然还能照常运转。

Once outside, fending off cruel sunlight’s thesis, he beat a path to the pharmacy. Heaving himself over the counter in the back, （-这是翻到柜台后面？）he shifted the instrumentalized pharmacist’s clothes out of the way once more and selected the correct combination of pills for Asuka. Everything was clearly labeled. This really was so much simpler and cleaner than anything else they could have done.

到了外边，他踏上去药店的路。他又一次把药剂师们的衣物推到一边，拣取了一些合适的配套药物给明日香。每种药都贴着标签，清楚易懂。比起另外那些他们本来要做却没能做成的事，这一件实在是太过于简单明确。

Next, he stopped at the convenience store. The aisles were as empty as they’d been yesterday, and he murmured a hello to no one in particular as he pilfered sports drinks, iced coffees, and candy for breakfast. Honestly, how did Misato do this so often?

之后，他在便利店门口停住脚步。和昨天没差别，过道依然空无一人。他朝着空气咕哝了一句“你好”，然后搜刮了一些运动饮料，冰咖啡和糖果充作早点。说句实在话，美里小姐经常这样做心不会累吗？

~

The night before, as they lay down to sleep, stomachs groaning, Asuka had turned to Shinji.

“You were awful to me,” she said. “The last time we slept in the same bed.”

“What?”

“You remember.”

“When I, uh, tried to kiss you?”

前一天夜里，他们躺下入睡之前，肚子还在咕噜噜地叫。明日香转头望向真嗣。

“你对我态度很差。”她说，“就是上一次我们睡同一张床的时候。”

“什么？”

“你自己心里有数。”

“呃，是我尝试吻你的那次？”

“No, idiot.” She stared at him, waiting for the light of understanding to grace his dull face. “You don’t remember?”

“No… Did I do something wrong? I did, didn’t I?”

No. No. No. That was wrong. He had to remember. It didn’t make sense if he didn’t remember.

“不是，笨蛋。”她盯着他，等待他木讷讷的脸上灵光乍现，“你不记得了？”

“不记得……我做了什么不好的事？肯定做了，对不对？”

不，不，不。哪里搞错了。他必须记得，不然根本说不过去！

“Shinji, please, tell me you remember.”

“Asuka,” he scowled. “Give me a clue. Remember what?”

No. They were just drunk. It was too painful otherwise.

“Nevermind,” she scowled. She turned her head away but when she felt his hand touch hers, she rolled over to him, burrowing into him as best she could, praying that her skull would leave her in peace somehow.

“真嗣，拜托，告诉我你记得。”

“明日香，”他板着脸说，“给我点头绪吧。究竟是什么事？”

不。他们只是醉得意识不清了，要不然，她受不了那样的痛苦。

“别管了。”她沉下脸，把头转了过去，但是当她感觉他碰到她的手，又翻过身，用力钻进他的怀抱，祈祷着她快疼炸了的脑门子能够消停一会儿。

It was a night months ago, when they still lived together with Misato in a queer approximation of a family. Asuka rose and drifted into the bathroom, as if in a dream.

She stared at herself in the mirror, she remembered. Marshalling courage like a general under fire, rallying her troops.

那是一个月前的夜晚，他们和美里同居，三人勉强凑成一个奇妙的家庭。明日香起身去洗手间，像是魂不守舍。

她还记得，她凝望着镜中的自己。鼓足了勇气，就像一个顶着炮火连天的将军想要集结起她的军队。

“This sucks,” she scowled. “Why do I have to be the one to do this?”

She plunged the bathroom into darkness and let her feet guide her to Shinji’s room. She paused at the threshold, listened to his breaths spilling softly into the air. The quiet hum of his SDAT player. She stepped inside and slid shut the door.

“逊毙了。”她阴沉着面孔，“为什么非得我做不可呢？”

她离开洗手间，把黑暗留在身后，任凭双腿机械地引她去真嗣的房间。她在门槛处停顿，听着他的呼吸声轻轻地飘散在空气中，听着SDAT播放器发出安静的哼鸣。她走进去，关上身后的移门。

“You will hold me,” she told him, in a whisper, not caring one bit when he didn’t react. She had already decided what to do.

Lowering herself delicately over him, she balanced herself, letting her night shirt tickle his nose. That would do it. If he awoke right now, he’d open his eyes, see her bared for him and—

Nothing.

“你会抱我的吧。”她对他说，只是一句低语。他没有回答，她也完全不在乎。她早已决定好了该做的事。

小心翼翼地低下身，趴在他上面，她稳住重心，用睡衣短袖轻撩他的鼻翼。一定能奏效的。如果他此时正好醒来，一睁眼就能看见她为他展开的裸姿，然后——

没有反应。

Fine. A heavy sleeper. Or playing hard to get. She lowered herself closer to him, her thighs against his, her breath on his face.

Nothing.

Ach, du heilige Scheisse…（哦，你这个混蛋...）

行吧。他睡得太沉，或是她得再加把劲。她放低身子，靠他更近些，她的大腿与他紧贴，她的呼吸拂过他的面。

毫无动静。

She slid her hand under his shirt, rested it on his belly for a second, and then drifted down. She found her quarry and was briefly pleased when it responded to her exactly how she’d planned. There was no question that he wanted this, then. She moved her hand and a moan tumbled out of his lips.（-日常为英→中的动词而困扰）

她把手伸到他的短袖下面，在他的小肚子上停留了一秒，继续往下摸。她逮住了目标，那东西如所预料的那样回应了，让她短暂地兴奋了一下。毋庸置疑，他肯定喜欢这样。她保持手的移动，一声呻吟挣开了他的双唇。

Wake up, Shinji, she commanded in her heart. Wake up and see what I’m doing. Look how pathetic I am. See how lonely I am. I’ll do anything, just so long as you touch me and hold me. You’re the only one who’ll ever know how low I’ll sink just to feel something, so please wake up. Please. Please, Shinji, wake up and do whatever you want to me. Please, please, please, Shinji—

快醒来，真嗣，她在心里命令道。醒来，看我在做什么！瞧瞧我有多可怜，看看我有多孤单。我会做任何事，只要你愿意摸我，抱我。你将是唯一发现我会为了一己之欲能堕落到何种地步的人，所以求你了醒来吧。拜托了，拜托了，真嗣，醒过来，你想对我做什么都可以。求求你，求求你，求求你了，真嗣——

He groaned and she felt something hot and wet on her hand. She pulled it out and sat back on her heels. She stared at the slime on her palm in the moonlight streaming through his window.

他呻吟了一声，她感觉有什么很烫很湿的东西在她手上。她抽出手，屈膝坐在脚后跟上。借窗外透进来的月光，她凝视着手心银白色的粘液。（-多加了个修饰词）

Playing with me.（-是指真嗣耍她玩，还是她的祈求？） He’d rather ignore me than touch me, she thought. Why is this so hard? Why does everyone hate me? Why won’t someone hold me? First Mama, then Kaji, and now Shinji—

和我一起玩。她心想，他宁愿无视我，也不愿碰我。为什么会这么艰难？为什么每个人都恨我？为什么没有人愿意抱我？先是妈妈，后是加持，现在是真嗣——

She left him and returned to the bathroom. She washed her hands three times and still they didn’t feel clean.

“I’m scum,” she whispered, and pressed her palms to her face.

她离开了他，回到洗手间。她把手洗了三遍，仍然觉得它们不干净。

“我是个贱人。”她小声说，把脸埋入手心。

Somehow, being in this apartment again brought this memory back and Asuka watched herself cry, alone, in the bathroom all night long until the soft clink of coffee being made hooked her cheek and dragged her back to consciousness.

不知为何，再次回到公寓，这份记忆也跟着回来了。明日香看见她自己，孤零零的一个人，在盥洗室里彻夜哭泣，直到咖啡的热气熏蒸上了她的脸颊，才把她拉回现实中。

“Oh,” he said with a soft smile that she wanted to smack off his face. She hovered in the doorway, every muscle yearning for more sleep. “You’re awake. Good morning.”

“I feel,” she announced. “Like shit.”

“喔，”他说，笑容欠揍般地温柔，她想往他脸上扇一耳光。她在门口徘徊着，每寸肌肉都精疲力竭，索要更多的休息。“你醒了啊。早上好。”

“我感觉，”她说，“烂透了。”

“Here—“ he said, and pressed a blue bottle into her hands. “It’s electrolytes, so I think it’ll help. Misato would drink this stuff sometimes.”

“这个给你——”他说，把一瓶蓝色的饮料塞到她手里。“是电解质，所以我想应该有帮助。美里小姐有时也会喝的。”

“That’s how you know you have a problem,” she muttered, but she wasn’t above following the example of their departed guardian. She chugged half the bottle in a single gulp and collapsed at the table. Shinji had covered it with candy; many of her favorites, in fact. She nibbled at a few pieces while he made breakfast.

“一旦到了想要喝这玩意儿的时候，你就知道自己有问题了。”她嘟囔道，但她也学了他们监护人的榜样，一口气灌了半瓶入肚，然后瘫在了餐桌边的座位上。真嗣在桌上放了许多糖果；实不相瞒，很多都是她的最爱。她咀嚼其中几颗时，他去做了早饭。

He placed a plate in front of her and she murmured something like a thank you. They ate, mostly without words, until Asuka caught sight of her hand and shuddered.

“You really don’t remember that night.”

“What?”

“That night I came to you.”

He shook his head. Her cheeks began to flush and her eyes felt hot.

“I thought you were—rejecting me.”

他做完早餐，把盘子放在她面前，她咕哝了一句类似感谢的话。他们开动了，几乎全程没有交流，直到明日香瞧见自己的手，打了个寒战。

“你真的不记得那天发生了什么吗？”

“什么？”

“就是我来找你的那个晚上。”

他摇头。她的脸颊开始泛红，双目刺痛。

“我以为你——你拒绝了我。”

“Asuka, what are you talking about? I, uh, did try to kiss you, kind of. That one time. When we were training together.”

“No, idiot, not that. I remember that.”

“明日香，你在说什么呢？我，呃，是想过要亲你啦。就那一次。我们一起训练的时候。”

“不，笨蛋，不是那次。我记得那件事。”

She took a breath and told him what she’d done. Her eyes remained on her palm until she’d told him everything and then, only then, did she allow her gaze to rise and meet his.

“I had no idea,” he whispered. “Really.”

“No. There’s no way.”

“Seriously.”

她吸了一口气，把她做的全告诉他了。期间，她的眼睛一直盯着手心。直到她道出了全部，只有那时，她才敢抬起眼眸，和他对视。

“我不知道。”他轻声说，“真的。”

“不。这没可能。”

“我说的是实话。”

“I thought you hated me so much you wouldn’t even wake up when I was touching you.” Her voice was small. Trembling. Exactly how she felt. “No one—no one loved me. I remember screaming and crying in the bath and neither of you, not even Misato, came to me. I hated you for hating me.”

“I never hated you, Asuka.”

“But you must hate me now. How could you not?”

“我以为你是那样恨我，以至于我碰你的时候，你都不肯睁开眼睛。”她的声音细微。发着抖。正应了她那时的心情。“没有人——没有人爱我。我记得在浴室里尖叫，哭泣，而没有一个人，甚至连美里也没有，来关心我。我讨厌你恨我的事实。”

“我从来不恨你，明日香。”

“但你现在也该恨我了。你怎么能不恨呢？”

“I don’t want to hate anyone.”

“Hate is like love. You can’t control who you hate or who you love. It just happens.”

“Fine,” he said. “I still don’t hate you. I wish I had woken up. Maybe everything would be different now. Maybe we’d—“

“我谁也不想恨了。”

“恨就像爱一样。你不可能控制自己去恨谁，或者爱谁。它就是那样发生了。”

“好吧，”他说，“但我还是不恨你。我希望我那时能醒来。也许一切都会不一样。也许我们能——”

“I don’t want to think about that anymore. It hurts too much.” She let the feeling of loss hang in the air for another moment. “You don’t hate me?”

“No.”

“Liar. You raped me and tried to kill me. And somehow, I still hate myself more than I hate you.”

“我不愿去往那个方面去想了，只会让我难过至死。”她让这份怅然若失的感觉悬留在半空，“你不恨我？”

“不恨。”

“骗子。你侵犯了我，还想要杀了我。不知怎么搞的，我还是恨我自己超过恨你。”

“I’m sorry.”

“Then prove it.”

“How?”

“对不起。”

“那就证明一下。”

“怎么做？”

She had nothing. They watched each other for a few moments and then he rose. He circled the table and leaned into her. She smelled his scent and cooking oil and soy sauce and sweat, all encircling her as he draped his arms around her neck. She gave a pathetic little mewl and she despised whichever corner of her heart that escaped from as she stiffened. （-这里意译咯？）He held her, and the warmth seduced her. She placed a hand on the arm over her chest and reached for his face.

她不再言语。有一会儿，他们只是望着对方，而后，他站了起来，绕过餐桌，向她倾身。他用双臂轻轻勾绕住她的颈窝，他的体香，油烟味，酱油味还有汗味，全都把她包围了。她发出了一声哀怜的、细小的呜咽，又板直了身体，无论是内心哪一部分在纵容她，她都不想承认那是自己发出的。他抱着她，这温暖令她沉醉。她把一只手伸到环绕她胸口的手臂上方，摸着了他的脸庞。

“Why…” she murmured.

“What?”

“Why does this feel so good?”

“为什么……”她喃喃道。

“什么？”

“为什么感觉这么好呢？”

~

Cleaning the kitchen was a small, simple thing, but it was something he could do with a beginning, middle, and end. Something he could finish and sit back and remember how it had been different at the beginning. （-想了半天，意译了x）Something he could tell himself was finished.

It wasn’t this hellish limbo, he knew.

打扫厨房是件简单的小活，这是一件能按部就班完成的事，是完工后能一屁股坐下来欣赏自己劳动成果的事，是一件做完以后能告诉自己“已经大功告成”的事。

至少他有十足的把握，而不像别的事那样不确定。

Asuka showered and he dressed her wounds again. They said nothing to one another. Once, when something stung, she reached for him and he caught her hand, gripping her tight, and she made a sound that almost seemed pleased, as if she’d been sure that he’d disappeared somehow.

明日香洗了澡，他又给她处理了伤口。他们没有和对方说话。只有一次，她感觉哪里疼了，就把手伸向他，他紧紧地攥着她的手，她发出了类似喜悦的声音，好像她不用再担心他会不明缘由地消失。

He showered too and found her dressing in her room, the door open. That was unusual for her, but what was normal these days?

“Asuka, here’s your medicine. I can read the kanji to you. If there are any you don’t know. You should read the instructions before you take it.”

他也洗了澡，然后看见她在自己的房间里换衣服，门是开着的。对她这种人来说是这很不寻常的现象，不过这些日子还有什么事能称得上寻常呢？

“明日香，这是你的药。如果你有哪里不明白，我可以给你读上面的汉字。用药之前，你应该先看说明书。”

She scowled and snatched them out of his hand.

“Obviously, I know that.”

她板着脸，从他手里夺过了它们。

“这种事我当然知道了。”

She’d pulled out jeans today and the same sweatshirt, which seemed to have escaped the worst of the previous night’s indulgences. That reminded him—he ought to do some laundry today. There were dirty clothes left from before Third Impact, even some from before Asuka ran away which he and Misato had left in her room, as if they could lure her back by expecting her to wash them herself.

她今天穿了牛仔裤，上身还是同样的运动衫，似乎从昨晚的放纵中逃过一劫，没有染上污秽。这提醒了他——他今天该洗衣服了。三冲之前就有很多脏衣服留下了，甚至有些还是明日香离家出走之前，他和美里丢在她房间里的，好像这么做他们可以叫她回家来洗掉自己的衣服似的。

Should he even wash Misato’s clothes? He’d done it before, so that wasn’t the issue, but washing clothes for someone you’d seen die still seemed like a strange ritual he wasn’t prepared for. Should they create a grave for her? Should they create graves for everyone?

“Shinji, what are you staring at?”

“Sorry,” he stuttered. “I was… thinking about laundry.”

他应该把美里的衣服也洗掉吗？他之前也做过，所以问题不大，但是给一位曾死在你面前的人洗衣服，就像是某种毫无准备的陌生仪式。他们应该为她做个墓吗？还是他们应该给所有人都搭上墓碑？

“真嗣，你在看什么？”

“对不起，”他结巴地说，“我……只是在想洗衣服的事。”

“Mein Gott, you really are an idiot. Well, I left my dirty things on the floor so feel free to wash them. Don’t be a pervert about it, though.”

“What? I’ve done your laundry before. It’s nothing I haven’t seen.”

Still, she rolled her eyes and pushed past him.

“Where are you going?”

“Mein Gott,你真是个笨蛋呐。那我把脏衣服都扔在地上，想洗就洗吧。不过，别对它们打什么下流的主意。”

“什么？我之前就洗过你的衣服呀。能看的都看见过了。”

她还是翻了个白眼，挤过他身边。

“你要去哪儿？”

“For a walk. I’m still pretty weak but sitting around here isn’t going to change that. And I’ll go insane if I sit here any longer.”

Shinji bowed his head.

“Are you coming back?” he asked and something in Asuka’s posture caught his eye: a tremor of surprise. Did I get it right, he wondered, or had she not even considered leaving?

“去散个步。虽然我还是没什么力气，但一直坐着也无济于事。要是再这么呆坐下去，我准得发疯。”

真嗣垂下脑袋。

“你还会回来吗？”他问道。明日香的神态中有什么吸引了他的目光，是一阵讶异感。是我猜中了她的心思，他心想，还是她根本没考虑过离家出走？

“Probably,” she said with a shrug. She tilted her head back, an imperious little gesture that he remembered from the old days of a few months ago. “I mean, where else am I going to find someone to wait on me hand and foot? Not unless more people start to wake up.”

“Asuka,” he said as she started for the door again. “Do you think more will come back?”

“可能吧。”她耸了耸肩说道。她把头往后一仰，这是一个盛气凌人的小动作，让他联想起她几个月前，还没有被生活所摧残时的样子。“我的意思是，我还能上哪儿去找一个心甘情愿等我回家的人呢？除非有更多的人苏醒。”

“明日香，”当她走向门口时，他又问，“你觉得还有人会回来吗？”

“Probably.” She gave a short, bitter laugh. “I mean, it’s not like being in that big lake is all that much fun, is it?”

“Why did we come back first, then?”

“可能会。”她发出一声苦涩的、短促的笑音，“我是说，一直呆在那个湖里也没什么意思吧？”

“那，为什么最先回来的是我们呢？”

“We probably hate ourselves more than anyone else in the world. Or maybe we’re so insufferable that everyone else voted us out and made us think it was our own choice.”

He found himself smiling in spite of everything.

“That’s pretty dark, Asuka.”

“可能我们恨自己，超过了恨世界上的其他人。或者可能我们太惹人厌了，大家投票把我们踢了出去，并且让我们以为是自己的意愿。”

虽然话不中听，他发现自己还是笑了。

“你的想法好黑暗，明日香。”

She turned on her heels, grinning, a child pleased at her own joke.

“Right? I bet that was it.”

“And they made sure we’d wake up together, so we can torture each other,” he added. Her grin grew bigger and she leaned against a wall.

她转动脚跟，微笑，对自己讲的笑话感到孩子气般的满意。

“是吧？我打赌就是那样子的。”

“他们还确保我们会一起醒来，这样我们就可以折磨对方了。”他加了一句。她的笑容变深了，人倚在墙边。

“Now it all makes sense! This is probably what NERV was designed for. Just to torture you and me, specifically.”

“Obviously. That’s why they made us live together.”

“Seriously! Only a real sadist could have come up with that. It was probably your dad.”

“现在一切都说得通了！这可能就是NERV设计好的阴谋，特地为了折磨咱俩！”

“显然。这就是为什么他们叫我们住在一块儿。”

“是真的！只有一个虐待狂才会想出这般主意。很可能是你爸。”

“That does sound like him, doesn’t it?”

She turned to leave but stopped once more:

“Hey, Shinji—if I didn’t come back, would you go looking for me?”

“Huh? Yeah, of course.” He waited for any other clues in her body language. “You’re all I have left.”

“What if other people wake up? What if Misato comes back? Would you still go looking for me?”

“听起来就像他会做的事，不是吗？”

她转身要离开，又再次停下来：

“嘿，真嗣——如果我没有回家，你会出去找我吗？”

“呃？嗯，当然了。”他等着她的肢体语言能给他点头绪。“你是我仅有的。”

“如果其他人也苏醒了呢？如果美里回来了呢？你还会来找我吗？”

“Of course.”

“Liar.”

“I would!”

“You didn’t, last time,” she scowled（-吐槽一下这个词用得好频繁，我词穷了x） and dipped out the door before he could come up with a response. He sighed, and went to start gathering their laundry when he saw the medication sitting on her bed.

“She didn’t even take it,” he whispered to himself.

“当然。”

“骗子。”

“我会的！”

“上次，你就没有。”他还没来得及想出合适的回答，她就板着面孔出门去了。他叹息，去整理他要洗的衣物，这时他看见了她床头的药品。

“她甚至一颗都不吃。”他小声对自己说。

~

It took her a while to find what she wanted. Not because she wanted to use it, but because she just wanted to—well, she didn’t know what she wanted to do with it.（-这里的It是指下面的商店？）

A small men’s boutique a few kilometers from the apartment. Far enough that Shinji wouldn’t stumble upon it if he went out while she was gone. She let herself in, walked past the crumpled suits, soaked through with LCL, and found the belts. She selected a thick leather one, long and black, and found a chair. Once upon a time, someone would have sat there to try on shoes or rest in between interminable suit fittings.

花了好一会儿她才找到合适的地方。

距离公寓几公里外有一家小型男装店。这个距离足够远，即使真嗣出门，也不可能和她巧遇。她走进店里，经过那些被LCL沾湿，皱成一团的衣服，找到了一些皮带。她选了一根厚厚的、皮革材质的，细而乌黑的皮带，再找了把椅子。曾经，有人坐在上面试鞋子，或是在无休止的换衣间隙中小憩。

Now, Asuka balanced atop it. She still wasn’t tall enough, so she piled a few boxes on the seat until she could reach the shop’s rafters.

“This is how she did it,” she murmured as she looped the belt around the rafters. “Mama.” She tied it off and made another loop with the buckle.（-仔细读这里的时候心都悬起来了）

Of course, she wasn’t going to do it. She just wanted to know that she could, if she needed to.

现在，却是明日香站在上面。她还不够高，所以她还在椅子上面叠了几个盒子，这样她就能碰到天花板的椽子了。

“她之前就是这么干的。”她嘴里念叨着，将皮带绕了椽子一圈。“妈妈。”她把它系好，用皮带扣又再绕了一圈。

当然，她不打算这样做。她只是想知道她是否能做到——如果有必要的话。

But—

It couldn’t hurt to try putting her head through it? Just to make sure.

And maybe—

There’d be an accident—

And she wouldn’t have to—

No.

但是——

把她的头放上去，也不会疼吧？只是想确认一下。

也许——

就像遇到一场意外——

她就不用再——

不。

As she touched the leather loop to her neck, she felt something still there, as if she’d been branded. Across her collar bone, something tingled and she sighed. It was where he’d laid his arm.

“Why do I want his warmth so badly?” she whispered as she climbed down from the chair. I’m pathetic.

她抓着皮革环放到脖子下面，感到仍然有东西在她身上，就像她被烙上了印记。沿着她的锁骨是隐隐约约的刺疼感，她叹了口气。这是他手一度搭着的地方。

“为什么我这么想要他的温暖呢？”她轻声说着从椅子上爬下来。我真是可怜。

I shouldn’t want this from someone who hurt me so badly, she told herself. I shouldn’t want him. I should hate him. I should be scared of him. I want to hate him. I want to hate him. I want to him.（-笔误还是有意为之？）

The elevator dinged to their floor and with each step, she heard the words in her skull.

I want to hate you, Idiot-Shinji. I want to hate you, Idiot-Shinji. I—

“’m home,” she murmured. Shinji leaned out of the kitchen.

我不应该指望从一个伤我如此深的人那里得到这东西，她对自己说。我不应该想要他。我应该恨他。我应该害怕他。我想要恨他。我想要恨他。我想要他。

电梯叮咚一声到他们的楼层了。每走一步，她都感觉这些话在她的脑子里胀开。

我想要恨你，笨蛋真嗣。我想恨你，笨蛋真嗣。我——

“我回来了。”她嘀咕道。真嗣从厨房里探出身。

“Welcome back! How was your walk?”

“Fine,” she grunted. She sniffed the air. It was stuffy in the apartment. It smelled like meat and apples, sweet scents from a forgotten homeland so far away from these islands in the Pacific.

“What are you making?” she murmured, drifting over to him.

“欢迎回来！散步怎么样？”

“还行。”她嘟哝了一声。她嗅了嗅空气。公寓里空气不流通。她闻到像肉类和苹果般的气味，是来自与太平洋的这些岛屿相隔甚远的、被遗忘的故乡的甜蜜气味。

“你在做什么？”她晃到他身边，喃喃问道。

“Ah, well, uh, I went out today too,” he said. He was already blushing from the heat and he grinned in that sheepish way she hated sometimes and—didn’t hate—other times. “And I found a German cookbook. I mean, it’s written in Japanese, of course. But I thought you’d like it. I found some frozen meat since all the fresh stuff has gone bad. I figured I’d make schnitzel, since it’s not so different from tonkatsu? And some potatoes and baked apples too. It seems like it’s autumn now, so it feels right, doesn’t it?”

“啊，嗯，呃，我今天也出去了。”他说。他的脸已经因为热气而泛红，他用那种，她有时候讨厌——有时又不讨厌的羞怯方式微笑。“我找了一本德国料理的食谱。当然，书本身是用日本语写的。但我想你会喜欢它。我找了点冻肉，因为所有新鲜的食材都坏了。我决定要做schnitzel，应该和豚骨差不多？还有土豆和烘过的苹果也是。现在感觉像到了秋天，所以也挺应季的，不是吗？”

She stared at him. Her stomach turned flips of hunger and pleasure.

“Not that I really know what autumn is like. I’ve only read about it.”

She left the kitchen without saying a word and Shinji called after her: “It’ll be ready in fifteen or twenty minutes.” She forced herself into her room and forced herself to sit down. She wrapped her arms around her body and held herself there until her heart resumed its normal rhythm, until the desire to pin him against a wall and drown herself in him subsided.（-只是感觉沉溺啊、淹死啊这种词都不大对味hh）

她望着他，她的肚子因为饥饿和快乐而翻腾不已。

“虽然我也不知道秋天大概是什么感觉。我只从书上读到过。”

她一言不发地离开了厨房，真嗣在她后面说：“十五到二十分钟就好了。”她强迫自己进到卧室，又强迫自己坐下。她用双臂抱住身体，就这样紧紧抱着自己，直到她的心跳恢复到了正常的频率，直到那想要将他按压到墙上，将自己全然交付于他的渴望逐渐退去。

Next to her was the medicine, sterile packaging staring at her.

Well, one more night wouldn’t make a difference, would it? she wondered, picking it up and laying it to the side.

在她旁边放着药品，包装得一丝不漏。

嗯，多一个晚上也不会有什么区别吧，会有吗？她想着，把药拿起来，放在一旁。

“I guess neither of us ate much for breakfast or lunch,” Shinji chuckled politely as Asuka dug into her plate. The pleased grunts and slurps erupting occasionally from her lips had been the only thing she’d offered him once they sat down.

“There’s Misato’s beer too, but after last night—“

She shook her head and he abandoned that offer.

“我猜我们两个早饭和中饭吃得都不够多。”当明日香在狼吞虎咽的时候，真嗣发出斯文的轻笑。从坐下到现在，她的嘴里就时不时地发出着满足的咕噜和吞咽声，完全没功夫和他说话。

“美里的啤酒还有些多的，不过昨天晚上——”

她摇摇头，他放弃了提议。

“I’m, uh, glad you came back, Asuka. When I didn’t run into you on my errands, I thought you might have gotten into trouble.”

“我，嗯，很高兴你回来，明日香。当我出门没碰到你的时候，我想你可能遇上了什么麻烦。”

She swallowed her mouthful and sat back, breathing deep. He had no right to make German food this perfect. Especially for his first time cooking it. And in a post-apocalyptic hellscape, no less.

“What kind of trouble could I have gotten into?” she asked suddenly. He can’t know. There’s no way. But what if he—saw? What if he passed by the shop? What if he’s lying?

她咽下了嘴里的食物，背靠回椅子上，深深吸了一口气。他没有权利把德国菜做得这么无可挑剔，尤其他还是第一次！就算身处世界末日之后的极端恶劣环境之下，这也太超过了。（-不知道能不能这样翻哈哈哈）

“我还能遇上什么麻烦？”她突兀地问。他不能知道。不可能知道。但万一……他看到了怎么办？如果他刚好经过了商店？如果他在撒谎……？

“I just meant if you got lost or something. The city’s kind of different now.”

“Right.” She set back to her plate, trying to cut through the hunger simmering in her gut. Even as juices ran down her lips, as she savored tastes and scents she hadn’t experienced in nearly a year, a hunger remained.

“我的意思是，你可能会迷路之类的。这座城市和以前不太一样了。”

“好吧。”她继续，想要绞杀在她内心沸腾的饥饿感。即使当果汁滑入她的唇口间，当她享受到了将近一年未体验过的味与香，那份饥渴之欲仍然躁动难宁。

“Hey, Shinji,” she said suddenly. “What would you have done if I woke up?”

“What?”

“In the hospital.”

“Oh.”

“What would you have done?”

“嘿，真嗣，”她突然发问，“如果我那时醒了，你会怎么做？”

“什么？”

“医院里。”

“噢。”

“你会怎么做？”

“I… don’t know. I wanted you to wake up, though.”

“Why? You’d have gotten in trouble.”

“I didn’t care,” he shrugged. “I just felt so alone and I just wanted something—“

“Warm,” she supplied for him.

“Yeah, exactly.”

“我……不知道。虽然，我很想让你醒过来。”

“为什么？你会引火上身。”

“我不在乎。”他耸耸肩，“我只是觉得太孤单了，我只是想要一些——”

“温暖。”她为他补充。

“是啊，一点没错。”

“I saw your memories though. I know it sucked. It would have been way better if I were awake.”

“Yeah, that was only one of the problems.”

“If I’d been awake,” she said. “I would have probably let you.”

“I… I never thought you were interested in that.”

“不过我看到了你的记忆。我知道你的脑子是一团糟。如果我醒着，事情会好得多。”

“是的，那是其中一件问题。”

“如果我醒着，”她说，“我可能会由着你。”

“我……我从来没想过你对那种事感兴趣。”

“Apparently,” she sighed. “It’s not that I don’t feel violated. It’s just that after everything the Angels and NERV did to me, everything you did feels kind of wimpy, you know?”

“很明显，”她叹气道，“不是说我没觉得被侵犯到。只是在经历过那些使徒和NERV对我做的一切之后，你做的任何事就显得有点小儿科了，你明白吗？”

He bowed his head. Don’t cry, idiot, she thought to herself.

“I wish I’d woken up,” she said. “I probably would have slapped you but I wouldn’t have let you leave. I’d have made you stay with me in bed until they dragged you away.”

“That… would have been nice.”

She could see him blushing. Good.

他低下头。别哭啊，笨蛋，她在心里想着。

“我希望我能醒过来。”她说，“我可能会扇你一巴掌，但我不会让你走的。我会要你陪我在床上，直到他们把你拖走。”

“那……听上去很好。”

她能看见他脸颊泛红。好极了。

“I wonder how long we would have had. A few hours? Maybe the whole night? We could have gotten up to so much trouble. So much better than the dumb stuff we tried with each other.”

“I’m sure,” he said, still not looking her. She bit her lip. Look at me, damn it.

“Because it sounds like we both wanted the same thing, right?”

“我想知道我们会躺在那儿多久。几个小时？也许整个晚上？我们可能会惹上一大堆麻烦。那也比我们对彼此做的蠢笨事好上太多了。”

“肯定的。”他说，仍然没看她。她咬住了嘴唇。见鬼，看着我说话啊。

“因为听上去我们两个都想要同一件东西，对吧？”

“Yeah… Yeah, I guess. I was just so afraid of—“ and now he looked at her. “Being rejected. I felt like you were also rejecting me.”

“Idiot,” she whispered. “That’s what I always felt.”

“I felt like you hated me.”

“是……是啊，我猜是的。我只是太害怕……”他终于望向了她，“被你拒绝。我感觉你也一直在抗拒我。”

“笨蛋，”她低声说，“那是我的感受。”

“我感觉你恨我。”

“Only because I hated myself. You can’t love anything if you hate yourself. You can’t even like anything. It’s like half the world is just dead to you.”

“I know. But—even if it hurts, it doesn’t mean it’ll always hurt. Living, I mean.”

“只是因为我恨恶我自己。如果你恨自己，你就不能爱别人。你甚至不能喜欢他们。这就像是半个世界对你封闭了一样。”

“我知道。但是——即使会受伤，也不意味着会一直痛苦下去。我的意思是，活着的话。”

He was looking at her and Asuka was afraid for the first time since the beach. Not for her life, but for her heart, because she was sure that he knew what she’d done that afternoon.

他一直盯着她，这是明日香自沙滩以来第一次感到畏惧。不是惧怕生存，而是惧怕她的内心，因为她确信他已经知道了那个下午她做了什么事。

“Do you promise?” she whispered.

“Promise what?”

“That it won’t always hurt?”

“Yes. I think so, at least.”

“Then I’ll stay here with you.”

“I’m glad,” he whispered.

“你能保证吗？”她小声问。

“保证什么？”

“不会一直痛苦下去？”

“是的。至少我认为是。”

“那我就和你一起待在这儿。”

“我很高兴。”他轻轻地回应。

This time, she helped him clean up. There was a big mess from the deep frying and even though he’d assured her she needn’t help him, she worked, silently, alongside him till the tiny kitchen practically gleamed.

Later, when she thought back to that night, she tried to remember which one of them made the first move. Asuka was positive it was her, but the first thing she remembered was sitting with him on the balcony, in his arms, then on his lap.

这一回，她帮他一起打扫卫生。到处都是油炸的污迹。即使他保证说不用劳烦她，她还是安安静静地干了活，和他一块儿，把小小的厨房间清理得光洁透亮。

以后，当她回想起那天晚上，她试着回忆是谁先发起了第一步。明日香很确信是她自己，但她能想到的第一件事是他们坐在阳台，她在他的臂弯里，在他的两膝上。

“We could jump together,” she had said at one point. “And never deal with this world again.”

“Do you think we’d go back to the LCL?” he wondered aloud. “Just… reset?”

“Maybe. I don’t want that. I’d rather disappear.”

“You don’t think there’s a heaven? Or a hell?”

“我们可以一起跳下去。”某个点上她这么说，“再也用不着应付这个世界了。”

“你觉得我们会变回LCL吗？”他问出了心中的想法，“只是……重置？”

“也许。但我不想要那样。我宁可直接消失才好。”

“你不相信会死后会有天堂？或是地狱？”

“Shinji, with everything we’ve seen—do you?”

“No.”

“Exactly.”

“But… I wish there were. I wish there were another side to this.”

“真嗣，凭着我们见识到的一切来说，你信吗？”

“不信。”

“那就好了。”

“但是……我希望有。我希望世界有另一侧。”

She found his face in the darkness with her hands. She ran her fingertips over it. Found his lips.

“But there’s only this.” She could melt into him. Sink, once more, into the primordial soup（-化用了一下香香的角色歌心よ原始に戻れ）, but this time, it would be him. “Hey, do you want to kiss? I’m bored.”

She felt him shake with a soft, silent laugh. “Sure.”

在黑暗中，她的双手摸着他的脸颊，用指尖滑过它，找到了他的双唇。

“但只有这个。”她可以融化进他的体内。再一次，沉溺，让心、回归原始，但这次，对象是他。“嘿，想接吻吗？我正好无聊。”

她感觉到了他内心的震颤，以一个无声的、温柔的笑容体现出来。“好。”

“You brushed your teeth?”

“Yeah.”

“Then here I go,” she whispered, though she only had a few inches to move. She hesitated when she felt the tickle of his breath on her upper lip. She was about to say something when he spoke.

“你刷过牙了吗？”

“刷了。”

“那我上了。”她轻声说，虽然她只需要往前移动几英寸就行了。当她感受到他的呼吸轻挠她的上唇，她犹豫了。她想要说什么，但他先开口了。

“Hey, stop breathing,” he ordered. “That tickles.”

He pinched her nose and kissed her. She pounded her first against his chest, but made no attempt to escape. Instead, she crushed her lips into his, hungrily, as they’d done once before, before she’d lost her nerve. Finally, with a gasp, she pushed away from him and he released her.

“嘿，不要呼气，”他命令道，“挠得我很痒。”

他捏住她的鼻子，吻了她。一开始她还用拳头锤他的胸口，但没有逃开的意思。相反，在她失去勇气之前，她将嘴唇用力紧贴住他的，饥渴地，正如第一次她做的那样。最后，伴着一声喘息，她将他推离，他也放开了她。

“Idiot,” she hissed through panting breaths.

“Sorry. I couldn’t help it.”

“Idiot.”

“I’m sorry.”

“Liar.”

“笨蛋。”在急喘的呼吸间，她嘶声道。

“对不起。我忍不住。”

“笨蛋。”

“对不起。”

“骗人。”

“You did that to me,” he said with a failing smile.

“I know. When I did it, it was…” She paused to lick her lips. How lonely they felt now… “Different.”

“Then show me how it was different, Asuka.”

“Inside,” she whispered. “I’m cold. Unless you keep me warm.”

“是你先这样做的。”他想挤出个微笑，但失败了。（-他半笑不笑地说。？）

“我知道。但我做的时候……”她停下来，舔了舔嘴巴。如今他们是多么寂寞啊……“和现在不一样。”

“那就告诉我区别在哪里，明日香。”

“到里面去。”她轻声说，“我很冷。除非你先让我暖和。”

It broke her heart how gentle he was with her. She arched her back, biting her tongue, until she remembered there was no reason to—the world had ended, they were the new Adam and Eve or something (this idea filled her with parental dread and she made a mental note to take the medication first thing in the morning). They were alone. She screamed and grinded her hips into his face.（-这个体位x）

“Shinji, it feels too good,” she hissed into the dark. “I’m gonna’ die. I’m gonna’ die. I can’t take it—“ She screamed and a few seconds later, she let him go. He took trembling gasps and she giggled.

“That’s how it’s different,” she whispered at the dark.

她心碎了。他触摸她的时候竟然是那么的轻柔。她弓起背，咬住舌头，直到她想起已经没有制止的理由——旧世界已然临到终焉，他们就像新世界的亚当和夏娃（这个念头吓坏了她，让她不忘记在第二天早上一下床就服了药）。他们是仅存的人类。她尖叫，臀部碾着他的脸。

“真嗣，这感觉也太棒了，”她在黑暗中呓语，“我要死了。我要死掉了。我忍不住了——”她尖叫，几秒后，她放开了他。他颤抖地喘了几声，她咯咯笑起来。

“这就是区别所在。”她向黑暗低语道。

（-这一整段镜头感爆炸了）

He helped her onto his hips. She’d insisted on the darkness. Her scars still ached and she knew they’d ache even harder if he could see them.

“Wait,” he whispered. “We don’t have any protection or anything.”

She sighed.

“I know you’re dumb, but try to keep up, idiot.”

“But—“

他扶她坐到自己的髋部上。她坚持不要开灯。她的伤疤仍然疼痛，她知道如果他看见了，它们会变得更疼。

“等一下，”他轻声说，“我们一点保护措施都没有做。”

她叹了口气。

“我知道你很迟钝，但你得努力跟上，笨蛋。”

“但是——”

“I’ll take the pills tomorrow. We’re fine for tonight.” She felt him relaxed beneath her, his hands holding her and guiding her as she found him.

“Does that feel okay? Does it hurt?”

“No. I mean yes. I mean—“ she sputtered. “It feels good. See, isn’t this better than trying when I’m asleep? Does it feel good?”

“Yeah. It feels really good.”

“明天我会吃药的啦。今晚没问题的。”她感到在下面的他放松了身子，他的手抱住她，引她找到自己。

“这样可以吗？会不会疼？”

“不。我的意思是，疼。但是——”她语无伦次地说，“感觉很棒。怎么样，是不是比我睡着的时候做要好多了？是不是很爽？”

“是啊，真的很舒服。”

She rested her weak muscles against him, feeling his closeness. He started to move beneath her, and she clung tight to him, crushing his face into her neck.

“You remember what I said,” she whispered in his ear. She bit it. Hard. He yelped. “What my body is supposed to look like.”

He grunted and she took this as an affirmation. She worked her fingers into his hair, dug her nails into his scalp, and sighed into his lips.

她将虚弱的肌肉安靠在他身上休憩，感受到了他的亲近。他开始她在下面移动，她紧紧地扣住他，让他的脸深深地埋入她的颈项。

“你记着我说过的话。”她冲他的耳朵低语，还咬了一口。狠狠的。他短促地叫了一声。“记住我的身体原本的样子。”

他咕哝了什么，她将其视为了他的二次保证。她的手指穿进他的发丝间，指甲把握住他的头皮，伴一声轻叹，她吻入了他的唇。

（-我化开了……）

~ A near constant dance of souls, interrupted only by brief sparks of dull sorrow and recognition.

近乎永恒的灵魂之舞，被空虚的悲伤和认知的短暂火花打断。

She had awoken here, dissolved into the others, the billions of others, and stayed like that. Like instant coffee flushed in hot water. But something wasn’t right. Something was off.

她清醒着，融化在了数以亿计的灵魂中间，保持着那样的状态。就像一杯速溶咖啡冲入了滚烫的热水。只是，有什么地方不对劲。有什么弄错了。

She really, really, really wanted a beer. She had no body with which to drink it. No stomach to digest it. No neural synapses for it to dull. This was a fatal flaw in Instrumentality, she had come to realize. No beer.

她真的，真的，真的非常想喝啤酒。她没有嘴巴可以喝它。没有肚子可以消化它。没有神经系统可以被它麻木。她渐渐意识到，这是人类补完的致命缺陷。没有啤酒！

You’re lonely even here.

It’s not that! I just really, really want a beer, Rei.

Even when joined with all of humanity, you’re still lonely.

Are you kidding? Here, I’m with you and Kaji and my dad and Ritsuko…

And yet—

你在这儿也很孤单。

不是这样！我只是真的，真的想喝啤酒，丽。

即使融入了全人类的意识，你也还是孤独的。

你在开玩笑吧？在这里，我和你，和加持，和我的父亲还有律子……

即便如此——

Oh, fine. I want to make sure they’re okay. Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong to want to be—I just want a beer, okay?

Why won’t you say it?

Say what?

I can see into your soul, the red eyes were saying. I know what you want. Your soul is part of mine.

Family. Is that what you want to hear? Is it so wrong that I liked living with them? It wasn’t professional or anything but I miss them both and I’m afraid for them out there.

噢，行吧。我只是想知道他们是不是平安。这有什么大问题吗？难道我想要——好吧，我只是想喝杯啤酒！这也有错吗？

为什么你不说出来呢？

说什么？

我可以看透你的灵魂，那双红眼睛这么说道。我知道你想要的。你的灵魂是我的一部分。

家庭。这就是你想听见的？我喜欢和他们生活在一起，有什么问题吗？没什么高深莫测的，我只是想念他们，怕他们在外面过得不好。

The eyes smiled. She could have sworn Rei was touching her face, even though she didn’t really have a face. Or—wait—did she now?

那双眼睛微笑了。她敢发誓说丽抚摸了她的脸，即使她没有脸可以摸。或是——等等，她现在有了？

It’s going to hurt. Going back. Major Katsuragi.

会很痛苦的。如果你回去的话，葛城少佐。

“And that’s what the beer is for!” she chirped. She had a voice again.

“那就是啤酒派上用场的地方！”她嘘声说。她又能发出声音了。

Even union with the entire human race cannot erase the loneliness in our hearts.

即使全人类的融合也无法驱散我们心灵的孤独。

“Rei,” she asked suddenly. She felt as though she were rising out of a warm bath after dozing off. “Are you lonely too?”

“丽，”她突然问。她感觉好像从温暖的温泉中缓缓升起，然后飘离。“你也觉得孤单吗？”

I… do not know.

我……不知道。

“You can tell me if you are. Do you have to stay in there? Do you know?”

“如果你孤单，你可以告诉我。你必须要待在这里吗？还是你也不知道？”

I do not know, Major Katsuragi.

我并不清楚，葛城少佐。

“NERV is probably gone, Rei. You don’t have to call me Major anymore.”

“NERV可能已经解体了，丽。你不用再称呼我少佐了。”

I like it. It makes me feel less alone. Isn’t that strange?

我喜欢这样叫。会让我感觉不是一个人。很奇怪吗？

“I bet Shinji would like it. If you came back.”

“我打赌真嗣会喜欢的。如果你回去的话。”

Perhaps. I do not know if—I—should. Please take care of them. She saw Rei smiling, for real now. A smile she’d never seen before. Not the terrifying, otherworldly smile of the heartless goddess who had ended the world but the smile of a shy girl, bidding farewell to a friend. I will tell them where you went. You want them to follow?

也许吧。我不知道我是不是——应该回去。请照顾好他们。她看见丽在笑，现在是真正的笑容。她以前从未见过的笑容。不是一个终结世界的无情女神那超凡可怖的笑容，而是一个害羞的女孩子，在和一位朋友说再见时的微笑。我会转告他们你去的地方。你希望他们跟过去吗？

“You do that,” Misato said, grinning at the thought. “Ritsuko and I need to get sloshed and debrief this whole mess.”

“你说吧。”美里说，这个念头让她微笑，“我和律子需要好好地大醉一场，并且收拾收拾这一团烂摊子。”

And Kaji. You’re hoping he’ll follow you. And then you’ll know for real if—

还有加持。你希望他会跟随你吧。然后你就会真的知道，如果——

The beach. Since when had there been a beach here?

沙滩。从什么时候开始，这里有沙滩了？

She struggled to her feet. Rei’s face stared at her, far off over the pale crimson sea. She tried to wave but the face gave no indication that it looked at anything. Around her, the mass-produced EVAs, crucified and lifeless, stared at her, staring at Rei.

她挣扎着站起来。远远地，在泛白的红色海岸对面，丽的脸盯着她瞧。她试着招手，但这张脸却没有在注视任何东西的迹象。在她周围，被肢解的量产机了无生气，凝视着她，也凝视着丽。

“What the hell,” she muttered. She was wearing everything she’d been wearing back then. Her jacket, skirt, and—something ached in her belly. She pulled her shirt up to find a cruel gash, badly scabbed, disfigured her stomach.

“It would have been nice to skip this,” she sighed and fingered the wound. She shuddered. It would need attention before too long, but at least it wasn’t going to start bleeding any time soon. She hoped.

“什么情况？”她咕哝道。她的穿着和她临死前是一样的。夹克外套，短裙，还有她腹部的疼痛感。她把衬衫掀起，找到了枪洞，在她的腹部结了疤，伤势严重。

“要是可以不还原这个就好了。”她叹气，用手指碰了碰伤口。她哆嗦起来。得赶快处理一下，不然就麻烦了，不过好在它已经止血了。她希望是这样。

Misato stretched her legs and exhaled. She saw her breath—for the first time in over a decade.

“Cold,” she whispered. “It’s cold.” It was November, after all. Right? Maybe? It should have been cold, but they’d lost seasons with the Second Impact. Now, though…

Something caught her eye.

美里屈伸了一下两腿，吐出一口长气。她见到了她呼出的气体——这是十多年来第一次。

“好冷啊，”她小声说，“天变冷了。”毕竟是十一月，对吧？也许？在以前是该这么冷，只是第二次冲击后，四季轮回的日子一去不复返。而如今……

有东西吸引了她的注意。

The cross. Her medallion. Nailed to a shard of debris. She let out a happy yelp and forced her legs to move, pumping them in an odd simulation of running. She tripped forward, hurled herself back to her feet, and kept running until she collapsed before the necklace.

It was a sign, she knew. She knew who’d left it, and she could read the message, meant only for her—we’re alive. Come find us.

With quaking fingers, she guided its descent around her neck. Her face was wet and her tears were warm. She wiped them with the sleeve of her jacket.

“Guys, hold on,” she whispered into the cold wind. “I’ll be home soon.”

是十字架，还有她的吊坠。十字架嵌在一处废墟上。她发出一声高兴的尖叫，强迫自己的双腿大力迈开，勉强有了在跑步的感觉。她向前跌绊，又拼命爬起来，继续奔跑，直到跌倒在那串项链坠饰前。

那是个标志，她知道。她知道谁把它留在这儿的，她能读懂其中的讯息，这对她只意味着一件事——我们还活着。来找我们吧。

她用颤抖的手指取下家族的遗物，挂回到自己的颈项上。她面颊湿润，沾满了热乎乎的眼泪。她用夹克衫的袖子擦去了眼泪。

“小家伙们，坚持住，”她对着寒冷的夜风轻声道，“我马上就回家见你们。”

It was a long way to walk but she felt her strength returning with each empty city block. She was hungry and thirsty, but she was alive. There was no doubt about this. The clack of her boots on the sidewalk, echoing in this ruined metropolis—this made her smile. She jumped. She could jump! She had a body again. She clicked her heels together and cried out.

“Look at me!” she squealed, half-delirious. “Look at me, dad. Look at me, Commander Ikari. Look at me, Kaji. Look at me, Ritsuko! I’m still standing!”

回家的路长得很，每经过一个空旷的街道，她的力量就恢复一分。她又饥又渴，但她是活着的。没有什么比这更毋庸置疑了。她的靴子在路面上发出的踢踏声，回荡在这个破败的大城市里——这令她快活。她跳跃。她跳起来了！她再次有了身体。她并拢高跟鞋，大喊出声。

“瞧瞧！”她几乎是神志不清地叫喊道，“瞧瞧我，爸爸。瞧瞧我，碇司令。瞧瞧我，加持。瞧瞧我，律子！我还站在这里耶！”

She kicked an empty car, minding its own business on the empty street. “Take that, lease payments! Just try and find me now! I’m never paying up!”

Misato pressed her hand to her chest. What was this mad joy? How had she never realized how wonderful the world was? She needed to tell them. They’d never experienced autumn before. They would go to see the leaves change colors. Drink warm tea and cocoa as the wind whipped their hair. Travel what remained of this beautiful world, together, because the strangest monsters of the universe, somehow, some way, hadn’t managed to kill them—

她踢了一脚无人的车辆。街上一个人影都没有，她爱干嘛就干嘛。“听好了，贷款们！尽管来找我吧！我再也不会还了，呸！”

美里用一只手按住胸口。这癫狂的喜悦感是怎么回事？她怎么从没有意识到这个世界是多么美妙呢？她需要告诉他们。他们从来没有经历过秋天。他们需要看看落叶变幻色彩。他们需要泡一杯热茶或可可暖暖身子。他们需要一同去游历世界的各个角落，因为这个宇宙最奇异的怪物们，不知出于什么样的原因，竟然没有把他们灭亡——

“Wait,” she said aloud, freezing in place. Her stomach rumbled in the stillness. “Where are they?”

“等等，”她僵在了原地。她的胃缩紧了。“他们在哪里？”

She’d started walking back to her apartment as if on auto-pilot but maybe that was wrong—what if they weren’t there? After all, why would they be there? The world was empty. They could have gone anywhere they wanted. They might not even be together. She’d just—assumed—that home to her was home to them. That they’d felt the same thing.

就好像大脑开了自动步行模式，她开始往公寓的方向走去，也许不对——假如他们不在那里呢？毕竟，为什么他们要去那儿？世界广阔而空荡，他们可以自由地去往任何地方。他们甚至可能不在一起。她只是——假定——那个居所也是他们心目中的家。假定，他们全都想的一样。

The loneliness lurked at the edges of her heart and she took a steadying breath.

Either way, it made sense to go back to her apartment first, didn’t it? She’d put on a warmer jacket and pants, and if they weren’t there… No matter.

She’d find them. She’d have her little family back. She wouldn’t be lonely.（语气是？）

孤独在她内心的角落蠢蠢欲动，她稳稳地吸了一口气。

不论怎样，第一步是回到公寓，这是最合理的。她得换身暖和点的夹克和裤子，要是他们不在那里……也没关系。

她会找到他们的。她必须要找回她的小家庭。这样她才不会孤单。

~

Shinji awoke for the second morning in a row entangled in Asuka’s limbs. This time, though, she was naked and so was he.

Memories of the previous night came flooding back and he smiled, half in amazement, half in sorrow, at what they’d done. In response to his thoughts (no, that’s impossible, he reminded himself), she drew closer to him, nuzzling her face into his neck. Her lips found his throat and she suckled gently at the tender flesh.

She murmured something now, in her sleep, sighing.

又是一个早晨，真嗣醒来，发现明日香的手脚缠着自己。不过，这一次，她是裸着的，他也是。

前一天晚上的记忆如洪水般袭卷而至，想起他们所做的事，他微笑起来，半是惊奇，半是忧郁。在他的回想里（这不可能真的发生了，他提醒自己），她靠紧他，将脸蛋蹭在他的颈部，她的嘴唇亲吻他的喉咙，温柔地吮吸着娇嫩的皮肤。

仍然熟睡的她在小声咕哝着什么。

“笨蛋。”

“Idiot.”

Well, some things would never change, he supposed. He started to get up—really just a gently tremor in his limbs—and then gave up. What did it matter? They didn’t have to go to school. They didn’t have to be at NERV for tests. They didn’t have to pilot the EVAs. They didn’t have to do anything.

They were free. A kind of free neither of them had ever experienced. Where the only shackles left were invisible. Ensnared by their own dark hearts and the cloying guilt and bitterness that infused every look, every kiss, every touch.

好吧，有些事是不会改变的，他想。他想试着坐起来——真的只是稍微挪一下——然后就放弃了。有什么要紧呢？他们又不用去上学。也不用去NERV进行什么测试，更不用去驾驶EVA了。他们什么都不用做。

他们自由了。这是一种他们两个人都不曾体会过的自由。唯一的枷锁是看不见摸不着的。他们被自己的黑暗闭锁的心灵所俘获，用令人厌烦的愧疚感和苦涩之情注入进他们每一次的对视，每一个接吻和爱抚之中。

He wasn’t sure if this was right. If she liked this. If he liked this. But he felt like they had no choice but to cling together in the face of the loneliness, the coldness. They could share their warmth or die.

他不确定这么做是不是对的。她喜欢这样吗？他喜欢这样吗？但是在冰冷与孤独的环抱之下，他们别无选择，只能依偎在一起，互相取暖，不然就活不下去。

Was this love? To have a heart so intertwined with someone else’s? He imagined the strings of his life interwoven with hers. No, not the strings but the veins and arteries of his heart beating in time with hers, regardless of whether they wanted it or not. Was it love? Maybe. But a love unlike the ones he saw on TV or read about in manga. There were no cherry blossoms fluttering about them in the spring, no sparkles or longing looks. No pivotal confession of heart-felt feelings. Instead, they had something darker, crueler, but, he suspected, stronger. Something that would never let them go, no matter what they did. No matter how they hurt each other.

让心灵如此紧密地与另一人纠缠，这就是爱吗？他想象着命运的红线与她缠绕的样子。不，不是线绳，而是心腔内外与她同步收张的动静脉，无论他们是否愿意，这已然成既定事实。这就是爱吗？也许。但是这和他在电视上或者漫画里看到的迥然不同。没有盛放的樱花点缀在他们四周，没有激荡的火花和深情的凝望。没有真情流露的热烈告白。他们所体验到的，是更黑暗，更无情的东西，但他猜测，也是更强烈的。这是一种跃过他们的所作所为，逼迫他们在一起的东西。无论他们如何相互伤害，也不肯放过他们。

Did he like her? Did he even like her? If he’d had the choice of any girl in the world, if he’d been unburdened by his own unforgivable sins, would he have picked her? Of course, she was beautiful. That went without saying. Even when she was fully clothed, her beauty embarrassed him: she could pack more into a single look than most people could communicate in an entire evening. Her eyes, her face, the curve of her neck, hair the color of flames.

他喜欢她吗？他真的喜欢过她吗？如果在这世界，他有别的女孩可以选择，如果他可以脱去这无法饶恕的罪恶，他还会选择她吗？的确，她是漂亮的。这点毫无疑问。甚至她穿衣服的时候，她的美丽也令他神不守舍：她一个眼神能传递的内容比大部分人一晚上所表达得还要多。她的眼，她的脸蛋，她脖颈的线条，焰火般的发色。

She was cruel. But so was he. He’d violated her. But she’d violated him. She was broken, but so was he, and they’d shattered along similar lines. He saw them, in his mind’s eye, as two porcelain dolls, with nearly identical cracks. This meant, though, that you could slide a chunk of Shinji out and into Asuka and repair his cracks with her.

她是卑鄙的，他也是。他曾侵犯她。但她也侵犯了他。她的心是支离破碎的，他也是，他们受伤的轨迹几乎吻合。他用心眼看见了两个瓷娃娃，有着几乎完全一致的裂痕。这就意味着，如果你把真嗣娃娃铲掉一块，嵌到明日香娃娃上，刚好就能修补对方的缺损。

Somehow, he liked being with her. He liked her teasing. He liked that she refused his passivity. That she pushed him until he spoke, until he reacted.

He felt most human with her. How was it that there was no word for this feeling triangulated somewhere between love and hate but stronger than both combined?

Shinji shifted and Asuka’s body moved with him. Her eyes fluttered open and found his.

不知为何，他就是喜欢和她待在一块儿。他喜欢她取笑自己。他喜欢她不认可自己的被动和无所作为。她会使劲推他，直到他开口抗议，直到他采取行动。

和她在一起，他觉得自己最像个人类。为何没有一个词可以形容这种并非爱与恨单纯相加，而是在两者所支起的三角轴之上的更为强烈的情感？（-这句话好难啊！！triangulated，是不是要意译才好）

真嗣动了一下，明日香的身子也跟着他挪位。她缓缓眨了眨眼睛，对上他的。

Good morning, she mouthed.

Good morning, he mouthed back. Her lips hung open for a second and he received the invitation hungrily. She made a pleased sound when they broke apart.

“Have you ever,” she asked softly. “Slept so well that you thought you were only dreaming of sleep? Because you’ve always had nightmares and not having them feels like a dream?”

He shook his head.

早上好，她用唇语说道。

早上好，他也用同样的方式回应。她的嘴唇微启，静静地张了一秒，他随即饥渴地接受了邀请。当他们分开时，她发出了满意的声音。

“你以前有没有，”她温柔地问，“睡过这么香甜的觉，甚至以为梦见了自己在睡觉？因为你一直一直地做噩梦，所以当噩梦不见的时候，感觉就像在做梦？”

他摇头。

“Well,” she said with a throaty sigh, settling her head back on his chest. “That’s where I’m at.”

He slid his fingers through her hair and she writhed, cat-like, into his palm.

“But don’t let it go to your head, idiot,” she added. “This might be a one-time thing.”

“好吧，”她干涩地叹了口气，脑袋安贴在他的胸口，“我就是这样的。”

他的手指滑入她的发丝，她像只猫咪似的冲他的掌心扭了扭身子。（-我永远也翻不出这种可爱的感觉QAQ）

“别精虫上脑了，笨蛋，”她补充道，“这可能只会发生一次。”

Shinji must have made a face because the haughty look on hers faltered.

“Don’t give me that. Maybe not. Probably not, if you play your cards right. But don’t think this means anything it doesn’t.”

真嗣肯定露出了什么鬼脸，因为她脸上调皮的神情不见了。

“省了这招吧。也许还有第二次。很可能还有，只要你出对了手里的牌。但不要以为这件事就算达成了某种关系，其实并没有。”

“What does it mean, then?” he asked, carefully. She averted her gaze.

“Um, why don’t you tell me what you think it means and I’ll tell you if you have it right? Okay?” she asked in a small voice that somehow sounded very far away. Was she blushing? The flesh of her cheeks had definitely turned red.

“那么，它意味着什么呢？”他问得十分小心。她移开目光。

“嗯，为什么你不先告诉我你觉得它意味着什么，然后我来回答你说的对不对，怎么样？”她用一种细微到好像很遥远的声音说。她在害羞？她的脸颊明显变红了。

Shinji opened and closed his mouth a few times—how, exactly, would he explain this theory about something that isn’t exactly love and isn’t exactly hate, but which would bind them together even more powerfully than either and could tip either way, like a see-saw at a park?

真嗣张口又闭口，持续了好几回——他应该，怎样确切地解释这个说法，既不完全是爱情，也不完全是仇恨，而是一种较前两者而言，把他们更强有力地结合在一起的东西，而且还可以随时偏激，就像公园里的跷跷板？

The door to the apartment clattered open. A tired voice spoke into the silence: “I’m home.”

Asuka’s head whipped back around to his. Misato, they both mouthed.

公寓的门吱嘎一声打开了。一个疲惫的声音传入了安静的房间。“我回来了。”

明日香的脑袋刷地转向他。美里，他们同时向对方用唇语说出这个名字。

~

It was nearly noon and the place was empty. Standing in the doorway, she felt the sad smile tugging at the corners of her lips. The kitchen was surprisingly clean, but she supposed Shinji must have cleaned it that morning or maybe the evening before. She drifted to the fridge and started to reach for it when she heard the tumult of flesh and fabric in one of the other rooms.

时间快要中午了，这地方了无人迹。站在门廊里，她感觉嘴角扯出了一丝悲伤的笑容。厨房令人吃惊地干净，但她猜肯定是真嗣在上次某个早晨或者晚上清理干净的。她缓慢地走到冰箱边，正要打开冰箱门的时候，她听见另一个房间里传来了身体和衣服摩擦的骚乱感。

Don’t get your hopes up, she tried to tell herself. Maybe it’s—someone else. Maybe it’s a stray dog. Maybe it’s—

She knocked at Shinji’s door. She heard angry whispering and then a throat being cleared.

希望越大，失望越大，她试图劝说自己。也许——那是别的什么人。也许是条流浪狗。也许是——

她敲了真嗣的房门。她听见了愠怒的低语，还有一声清嗓子的咳嗽。

“Um, just a second,” Shinji’s hoarse voice called back. Misato took a step away from the door, covering her face with her hands, trying to catch the tears before they started falling.

“唔，等一下下。”真嗣沙哑的声音传了出来。美里后退一步，双手捂住了脸，想要接住差点流下来的眼泪。

A second later, the door whipped open and there they both were: red, disheveled, clad in a confusing array of mismatched clothes fit for different seasons. Asuka’s hair was a tangled mess and Shinji’s wasn’t much better. The three stared at each other for several moments, taking each other in.

Missato’s eyes drifted from their faces—shocked, flushed, and scarred in Asuka’s case—to their hands. They were holding hands. The two teens followed her gaze, found their hands, and looked at one another, before turning back to Misato.

一忽儿，门被飞快打开，两个人都出现了：面红耳赤，衣冠不整，从上到下令人困惑地依次混搭着不同季节的衣物。明日香的头发是一团盘结的乱麻，真嗣的也没好到哪儿去。

美里的眼睛从他们的脸庞——震惊的、带着红晕的脸，明日香还带着受伤的表情——到了他们的手。他们手拉着手。这俩小年轻跟随着她的视线，看见他们的手，然后面面相觑，又转回到美里。

Shinji’s mouth stretched into a soft smile.

“Um, welcome home,” he whispered.

Asuka was not so subtle. She wormed her arm tight around Shinji’s waist, gripped him to her as she all but shouted: “Welcome home!”

真嗣的嘴巴挤出一个和蔼的笑容。

“呃，欢迎回来，”他嘘声说。

明日香可没那么唯诺。她伸手用力缠住真嗣的腰，把他牢牢挟在自己身边，几乎是大声地喊道：“欢迎回来！”

~

Misato’s return couldn’t have come at a worse time, Asuka had decided. If there was one person in all of existence who could distract Shinji from her and derail whatever they were figuring out together—it was Rei. But if there were a second person who could manage that…

明日香赌气地想着，美里真是挑了个不能更讨厌的时机回来。如果非要从全人类中挑出一个能分真嗣的心，打乱他们好不容易创造的局面的人——那必定是丽。但是如果要说有第二个人也能做到这种事，那必定会是……

In a flash, Asuka chose her strategy. It was bold, and she knew it would confuse Shinji, but she knew he’d go along with her lead until she had a chance to explain to him.

“Sorry you had to see us like this,” Asuka giggled, covering her mouth with her hand. “Honestly, since we woke up, we haven’t been able to keep our hands off each other.”

电光火石之间，明日香选择了她的策略。这是个很大胆的做法，她知道真嗣会很困惑，但她也知道他会附从她的指挥，直到她有机会向他解释。

“对不起喔，让你看见我们这个样子，”明日香咯咯笑着说，一只手捂住了嘴，“实话实说，从早上醒来开始，我们的手就没有放开过对方呢。”

They sat around the dining room table as they had for so many awkward meals in the past. Shinji’s ears perked up at this detail but he said nothing to discredit her. His back was turned to them as he cooked, and she knew from the slump of his shoulders that he was confused. This was fine, but she would need more than silence to work up a convincing simulacrum of intimacy and happiness.

他们坐在餐桌边，就如从前数不清次数的尴尬饭局一样。听到明日香的细节描述，真嗣的耳朵弹了一下，但他没说什么让她掉面子的话。他背对着他们做饭，她可以从他垂落的肩膀判断他在困惑之中。这倒不要紧，但比起沉默是金，她需要他的言语来使这亲密和喜悦感更加可信，而不是捕风捉影。

“Isn’t that right, Shinji?” she cooed, laying extra honey on his name. She prayed he’d hear the threat worked into the syllables, and it seemed he did because he played his part just fine.

“Oh, don’t tell Misato that,” he chuckled. “It’s embarrassing! She doesn’t want to know all that.”

“不是这么回事吗，真嗣？”她在他的名字上用了更甜蜜的语气。她祈祷他听见了音节下面有意暗藏的威胁，他应该是听懂了，因为他演得恰到好处。

“哦，别告诉美里小姐这件事。”他轻笑道，“太尴尬了！她肯定不会想知道全部的。”

Well done, Shinji, she beamed silently into his brain. She giggled and covered her face.

“You two,” Misato sighed in obvious delight. “You know, I always hoped you two would get together. I knew you had chemistry. I could tell, right from the very beginning.”

干得好，真嗣，她的微笑进入了他的脑电波。她咯咯地笑着，以手掩面。

“你们两个，”美里高兴地叹气，“你们知道，我一直希望你们两个能成。我知道你们之间有那什么关系。甚至可以说，打从一开始就是如此。”

Shinji laughed a little too loud. “From the very beginning, huh?”

“You two dancing together—it was just about the cutest thing. I think I have a few videos of your practice sessions. We should watch them. It’ll be just like old times.”

真嗣笑得有点过于响亮了。“从最开始么，嗯？”

“你们一起跳舞——那是最可爱的画面了。我想我还存了几个你们练习的录像片段。我们应该回顾回顾，重温一下过去的美好时光。”

“Oh, how fun!” Asuka squealed. Shinji glanced over his shoulder. Too much. Tone it down. Roger that. He wasn’t a bad partner in this. “I mean, it’ll be silly but there’s nothing else to do, is there?”

“喔，会很有趣吧！”明日香尖叫道。真嗣往后瞥了一眼。太夸张了。小点声。收到收到。看来他也不是个差劲的陪演。“我的意思是，看录像带这种事是有点傻，但是现在也没别的事可做，对吧？”

Misato leaned back, exhaling slowly. “You’re right. You’re totally right. Until more people wake up… We can kind of relax, can’t we? I mean, we’ve got shelter. The electric grid is still operational. Water is fine. All that stuff is totally automated and it’ll be fine indefinitely until something needs maintenance but hopefully, we’ll have a few more specialists on hand by that point.” Here, again, was the policy wonk-administrator-tactician who had defeated Angel after Angel. Who worked twenty-hour days and drank herself into a stupor and still managed to outsmart alien intelligences time and time again. Who’d given her life trying to save Asuka. “We won’t have a lot of fresh produce for the foreseeable future, unless either of you want to take up farming—but it’s getting cold, so there’s not much chance of that for a few months, assuming our seasons have reverted to how they were when I was a kid. But the stores around here have plenty of frozen food, it looks like, and we can just take what we want.”（-缓翻）

美里往后倾身，慢悠悠地吸了一口气。“你是对的。一点不错。直到更多人醒来之前……我们可以轻省些，不是吗？我的意思是，我们有个避难所。电网也还在运作。水也供得上。”“在可预见的未来，很快就不会有太多新鲜食物了，除非你们愿意开垦农田——不过天气要转冷，考虑到我小时候那天气变化，再过几个月就没机会了。但是这附近的商店还有很多冷冻食物，看起来，我们可以随意取用想要的。”

“Exactly! That’s what we’ve been doing. In fact, Shinji made me schnitzel last night with some frozen pork cutlets he found.” Misato beamed at them, all but shaking in delight.

“You guys—are—the—cutest!” she squealed. “I can’t stand it! You two are so sweet! I’m so happy for you two. Really.” She reached back to tug Shinji’s shirt. “You saved her out there, didn’t you? I knew it. I knew you’d come through in the end. I knew you’d be a big ol’ hero and save her.”

“没错！这就是我们在做的事。实际上，真嗣用了他找到的冷冻猪肉给我做了炸猪排。”美里绽开笑容，几乎要兴奋得颤抖。

“你们俩——是——最可爱的——！”她尖叫，“我受不了啦！你们也太甜了！我真为你们感到高兴，真的。”她扯了扯真嗣的衬衫。“你那时候救到她了，对吧？我就知道。我知道你最后会成功的。我知道你是个能救心爱女人的无敌大英雄。”

Asuka watched the blood drain from Shinji’s face. He glanced back at her and she narrowed her eyes.

“That’s right,” he said with a steady exhale. “It was a hard fight.”

明日香见到真嗣的脸上血色褪去，他朝她瞥了一眼，她眯起了眼睛。

“没错，”他稳稳地呼吸着，“那是一场很艰难的战斗。”

“But that’s when I knew that Shinji was the only man for me,” Asuka chimed in, quickly. She hoped it wasn’t too quick. “The other EVAs messed me up pretty badly but Shinji saved me in the end.” She licked her lips. How to explain the scars? “They left a lot of bad wounds, though. It’s sad but, uh—I died in his arms.”

Misato’s eyes widened. “Seriously? Asuka!” She took the girl’s hands.

“但那个时候我才发现真嗣是我的真命天子，”明日香插嘴道。她希望没有太急切，“EVA量产机把我打得半死，真嗣最后救了我。”她舔了舔嘴唇。怎么解释伤疤呢？“那些家伙把我弄得一身伤。说来难过但是，呃——我在他的怀里死去了。”

美里的眼睛睁得大大的。“认真的吗？明日香！”她握住了女孩的手。

“Yeah. But he kissed me and held me tight. He told me he’d follow me to heaven or hell or whatever I went, and he’d bring me back. And then I woke up in the pool with everyone else, so it was okay. And then we woke up later and—here we are.”

“Just like Sleeping Beauty!”

“嗯。但是他亲了我，紧紧地抱住了我。他说无论我是上天堂还是下地狱都会把我带回来。然后嘛我在那个LCL池子里和其他人类一起醒来了。然后嘛我们两个都苏醒过来——我们就在这里了。”

“就像睡美人的故事！”

“Yeah,” Shinji murmured, setting plates down in front of them before joining them. “Something like that.”

“So, what have you two been up to? Besides,” and here Misato winked. “You know. I won’t ask too many questions—I saw the medicine in the bathroom. You two really have been going at it. Try not to have too many slip ups like that. At least not until we’ve got a doctor or two around.”

“是啊，”真嗣嘀咕，把餐盘放在他们桌前，加入了他们，“差不多是这回事吧。”

“所以，是什么让你们进展到那一步的？对了，”美里使了个眼色，“你们知道哦。我不会问太多问题——我看到盥洗室里的药。你们真的已经到那种程度了。不过别犯太多次那种错误。至少也要等我们有了医生再说。”

“Ah, I’m so embarrassed I left that out!” Asuka gasped. Of course, she wasn’t embarrassed in the slightest. She was simply relieved: Misato had supplied an explanation for the medication that didn’t come near the truth and that’s all she needed.

“We’ve been going on a lot of walks,” Shinji added. “And we found a bar we like.”

Misato’s smile wavered. “Um, a bar?”

“It’s fun,” Asuka said. Good work, idiot—let’s get Misato talking about something she likes. “Shinji found a book of cocktail recipes and we started going through them alphabetically. We go, like, every night.”

“啊，不小心把药忘在那里了，好尴尬！”明日香倒吸气。当然咯，她不可能有一丝一毫的尴尬之情。她只是松了口气：美里已经由避孕药自发想到了避开正确答案的解释，那正是她想要的。

“我们谈了很久的话，”真嗣补充道，“我们还找到了一家喜欢的酒吧。”

美里的笑容动摇了一下。“呃，酒吧？”

“很有趣的。”明日香说。好主意啊，笨蛋真嗣——让我们把话题引到美里喜欢的地方去。“真嗣找到了一张鸡尾酒点单，我们开始按照头一个字母的顺序依次品尝。我们的话，每晚都会去。”

As soon as she spoke, Asuka realized she’d overplayed her hand. Misato stared at them.

“You guys are kind of young for that.”

“You drink all the time,” Asuka growled, the cheery mask slipping. “I saw you eyeing the beer in the fridge when Shinji was cooking.”

“Well, that’s different,” Misato said with a wave of her hand. “I’m an adult.”

“We do other—adult—things.”

当她这么说的时候，她意识到自己有点过于耍聪明了。美里严肃地盯着他们。

“对你们来说还太早了。”

“你一刻不停地喝，”明日香说，高兴的伪装正在滑落，“真嗣在做饭的时候，我见你的眼睛时不时瞥一眼冰箱里的啤酒。”

“嘿，那不一样，”美里挥了挥手，说，“我是个成年人。”

“我们做了别的——成年人该做的事。”

“But those things can’t really hurt you if you’re careful,” Misato said, picking her words carefully. “But drinking is…” And here she sighed. “You’re right. I’m not really the one to give you two advice. I haven’t been the best role model.”

“Come with us to the bar, and you’ll see how fun it is!” Asuka redonned the façade, and she was determined there’d be no cracks this time. She caught Shinji’s eye and he looked away. Fine. As long as he didn’t say anything to make her suspicious.

“Maybe. Maybe.” Misato sighed and smiled. “I guess—having a little party to celebrate all of us being together again makes sense.”

“但如果你足够小心，那些事情不会真的伤害你，”美里谨慎地遣词造句，“但是喝酒……”她叹了口气，“你是对的。我不是给你们提供意见的人选。我从来都不是最佳榜样。”

“跟我们一起去酒吧，你就知道那多有趣了！”明日香重新恢复之前的形象，她决心这次要做到完美无缺。她对上真嗣的视线，对方移开了。行吧。只要他不说别的什么让她变得可疑就行。

“也许。也许吧。”美里叹气，然后微笑，“我猜——庆祝我们三人都活下来，开个小派对也挺不错的。”

“Exactly! A party!” Asuka giggled. “Shinji, doesn’t that sound fun? You’ll make food and cocktails?”

“Of course,” he stuttered. Look a little bit more excited, idiot, she thought.

“But only if I can manage to keep my hands off you for long enough,” she added.

If Misato noticed a disconnect between Shinji’s dimmed eyes and Asuka’s feather-light giggles, she said nothing about it. Instead, she relented and slid over to the fridge, selected a beer, and cracked it open with a satisfying hiss.

“You guys,” she whispered into the foam.

“正是如此！一个派对！”明日香笑了，“真嗣，这听上去不有趣吗？你会把饭和鸡尾酒做好的对吧？”

“当然了，”他结巴地说。表现得更开心一点啊，笨蛋，她心想。

“但前提是我得忍住一段时间不缠着你。”她补充道。

就算美里注意到了真嗣黯淡的眼神和明日香假装的笑声之间的脱节，她也没说出来，而是溜到冰箱边上，选了一灌啤酒，撬开，畅饮并发出一声满意的嘶声。

“你们俩啊……”她对着泡沫轻声说。

“Asuka,” he said as soon as they stepped into the elevator. “What was that?”

“Listen, idiot,” she grunted and slammed his shoulders against the wall. She found herself surprised for a moment—where had that come from? Whatever. It just meant she was feeling stronger. More like herself. “Misato doesn’t know what happened. I don’t know if she didn’t see everything in the soup, or if she forgot or what, but I don’t care. We can’t let her know about—what you did. And didn’t do.”

He wouldn’t meet her eyes.

“Why not? I don’t want to lie.”

“明日香，”他们一走进电梯，他就说，“那是怎么回事？”

“听着，笨瓜，”她嘟囔道，按着他的肩膀把他推到墙边。她还自觉惊讶——这股力气是从哪儿来的？不管怎样，这意味着她变得更强壮了。更像原本的自己了。“美里不知道发生了什么事。我不知道她在那锅汤里能不能看到一切，或是她自己忘了，总之不管。我们不能让她知道——关于你做的事，和你没做的。”

他不肯看她的眼。

“为什么不呢？我不想撒谎。”

“Because! It would hurt her, idiot! She thinks she died to save us! Do you want to take that away from her? And look at how excited she is to be back here! She thinks we’re in love and that makes her happy and it would be cruel if she found out the truth.”

“And what’s the truth?”

“Don’t start with that again.”

“Asuka, I—“

She tightened her grip on his shoulders.

“因为！那会伤害她，笨蛋！她认为她的死换来了我们！你想要让她扫兴吗？看看她回来以后是多么兴奋！她觉得我们相爱了，所以开心得不得了，如果让她发现了真相也太残忍了吧。”

“那什么是真相？”

“别又开始了。”

“明日香，我——”

她收紧了抓着他肩膀的手。

“Say it, idiot,” she whispered. Her stomach was doing nervous flips. The elevator reached the ground level and dinged. They stood like that, his eyes on the floor, as the door opened, and then closed exactly seven seconds later.

“Coward,” she muttered after another minute.

“再说一次，笨蛋，”她低声说。她的胃紧张地翻动。电梯到了最底层，发出“叮”的一声。门打开的时候，他们还像那样站着，他的眼睛盯着地面，于是几秒钟后，门又关闭了。

“胆小鬼。”一分钟之后，她喃喃道。

“Why do you care about her feelings?” he asked later, when they were shopping. She all but jumped when she heard his voice. They’d been silent on the walk over and had, wordlessly, been grabbing things off the grocery shelves. Their selection was a random mix of frozen things, dried ingredients, and candies. At one point, Shinji had tried to edit their cart down into a menu that made sense together, but Asuka merely retrieved the things he’d tried to set back on the shelves. “You never did before.”

“Maybe I’m trying to be nice.”

“I’ll believe it when I see it.”

“为什么你要在意她的感受？”之后他们在购物的时候，他问道。她听见他的声音差点没吓一跳。一路走来的时候，他们都一言不发，从货架上拿东西也没有交谈。他们选了一些冷冻的食物，干燥的配料，还有糖果。有那么一刻，真嗣试图把这些食物变成一个有意义的菜单，但明日香只是把它们全都放回去。

“你以前都不是那样的。”

“也许我想表现更好。”

“只有我亲眼看到我才相信。”

“Do you like these too?” she asked, holding up a package of frozen dumplings. He nodded and she tossed them into the cart. “I don’t want her to pity me. I already have to deal with your pity. I couldn’t stand hers.”

“How do I pity you?” His voice rose. “And even if I did, why would that be so wrong? We’ve both had terrible lives.”

“Because it’s rude!” she screamed, her voice echoing in the empty store. “It’s rude and it means you think I’m weak!”

“Maybe,” he said, turning away. “You are weak.”

“你也喜欢这些吗？”她问，拾起一包冰冻饺子。他点头，她把饺子扔进购物车里。“我不想她同情我。我已经受够了应付你的同情。我不能再忍受她的。”

“我怎么就同情你了？”他的声音提高了，“即使我那么做，为什么就错了呢？我们都有同样糟糕的生活。”

“因为那很没礼貌！”她叫道，声音回荡在空荡的商店里，“不仅没礼貌，而且还意味着你觉得我很脆弱！”

“也许，”他把头扭了过去，“你是很脆弱。”

Asuka’s fingers dug hard into the package of edamame she had been examining. “Say that again.”

“Maybe you are weak. So what? We’re all weak. Maybe you’ll just have to accept you’re not that special. That you’re just like me.”

“How am I like you?”

“You’re afraid.”

“No, I’m not.”

“Of me.”

明日香正在检查一包日本毛豆的质量，听到这话，她的手指深深嵌进了毛豆的包装里。“你再说一遍。”

“也许你是很脆弱。所以怎么了？我们都很脆弱。也许你只是需要接受自己没那么特别，接受你其实就和我一样。”

“我怎么和你一样了？”

“你在害怕。”

“不，我没有。”

“怕我。”

“I have a right to be afraid of you. After what you did.”

“But that’s not why you’re afraid. You’re afraid of—of—how I feel. And how you feel. I think.”

“And how’s that?”

“我会保留害怕你的权利。在你做的事情之后。”

“但那不是你害怕的原因。你害怕的是——是——我的心情。和你的心情。我是这样想的。”

“怎么解释？”

“You try to trap me into being the one to say it,” he yelled, hurling a bag of rice at the floor. It caught on something and tore open, spilling pearl white grains all over the jaundiced tile（-jaundiced，黄疸的，不明白这个词为什么形容砖地） floor. “Because you’re afraid to say it yourself. You want to know it’s a sure thing, before you let yourself feel it. Before you admit feeling it.”

“But you won’t say it either!” she said, a dry sob hurtling over her lips. She had been leaning against one of the glass doors in the frozen food aisle and now she slid down it, bowing her head. “You’re just as much of a coward as I am, so don’t act all high and mighty.”

“你想要引诱我做先说出它的那个人。”他喊道，把一包米甩在地上。它撞到了什么东西，裂开了，白色的谷粒撒在黄疸色的地砖上。“因为你害怕自己说出来。你想知道那是不是真的，在你允许你自己感受它之前，在你愿意承认它之前！”

“但你也不肯说啊！”一声干燥的抽泣掠过她的齿畔。她之前倚靠在冷冻食物区的一面玻璃门上，现在已经顺着滑到地上，头低垂着，“你跟我一样，都是十足的胆小鬼，所以别表现得高高在上。”

“What are we afraid of?”

“Rejection.”

“Pain.”

“Being alone.”

“That sounds right.”

“我们都害怕什么呢？”

“拒绝。”

“痛苦。”

“孤独。”

“听起来不错。”

He gave her his hand and after a second, she took it. She was in his arms again and even though the whole aisle was ice, she was warm.

“If someone pities me,” she whispered. “Then it’s like it was all for nothing. My whole life. Being… strong. Piloting an EVA.”

他朝她伸出了手，隔了一秒，她接受了。她又回到了他温暖的膀臂内，即使整个区都散发着寒气。

“如果有人同情我，”她小声说，“我就感觉我的努力都白费了。我的人生都白费了。变得……坚强也好，驾驶EVA也好。”

“Don’t you think,” he asked after a second. “There’s more to life than that? I mean, there are no more EVAs. Everything is easy for us, for now. You can relax, like Misato said.” He pressed his cheek to hers and she was surprised to find it damp.（-湿润的） “You can be weak.”

They kissed. She started to unbutton his shirt.

“Not here.”

“你不觉得，”过了一会他说，“我们的生命里有比那些更重要的事？我的意思是，已经没有EVA了。至少现在，生活不再刁难我们。你可以放松，就像美里小姐说的那样。”他的脸颊贴住了她的脸，她惊讶地发现他的脸是湿润的。“你可以露出脆弱的一面。”

他们接了吻。她开始解他的衣衫扣子。

“别在这里做。”

“Why not? You said yourself. We can do whatever we want.”

She kissed his chest. She hated his silence, so she bit one of his nipples（-乳头） until he yelped.

“This makes me feel less alone,” she whispered. “You’re still my slave, aren’t you?”

It took him long enough to answer that she started to feel nervous, but the reply finally came: “Of course. Forever, right?”

“为什么不呢？你自己说的。我们可以想怎样就怎样。”

她亲吻他的胸脯。她讨厌他一声不吭，所以她咬住他的乳头，直到他忍不住叫了一声。

“这样会让我少一点寂寞。”她小声说，“你还是我的奴隶，对吧？”

他的回答中间停了很久，久到她开始紧张了，最后回应终于来了：“当然。永远的约定，不是吗？”

“That’s right. This might be the last time we can for a few days, by the way. Because of the medication. I took it this morning.”

“There’s nowhere to lie down here.”

“We don’t need to lie down,” she told him, and began to work her jeans off.

“没错。说起来，这可能会是接下来几天内的最后一次了。因为那个避孕药。我早上吃的。”

“这里没地方可躺下来呀。”

“我们不需要躺着。”她告诉他，然后开始脱牛仔裤。

（-好家伙，随时随地做爱啊你们！）

“You guys were gone a while,” Misato laughed when they arrived home. Pen-Pen balanced on her lap, looking as if nothing had changed—as if the world hadn’t ended twice within the past fifteen years, as if alien gods hadn’t assaulted the Earth and reduced the entire human race to primordial goop. Misato was on her third beer, and had a selection of magazines and manga spread out before her—she didn’t seem concerned with the state of the planet either. “I was afraid something happened!”

“你们真是去了好久呐。”他们进门时美里笑道。Pen-Pen在她的大腿上端坐，看上去像是一切安然无恙，像是世界没有在过去十五年之内足足毁掉两次，像是外太空的神明没有入侵地球，把全人类化成一团原始的黏糊之物。美里已经在喝第三罐啤酒了，在她面前摊出了好几本杂志和漫画——她似乎也毫不关心地球目前的状况。“我还担心出了什么事呢！”

“We had to go to a few stores,” Shinji said before Asuka could come up with a good reply. “We decided to stock up a bit.” Asuka watched him shift his collar around to hide the lip-shaped bruise on his clavicle（-锁骨） and she bit her lip to keep from grinning too much.

“我们逛了好几家店。”在明日香想出个合适的答案之前真嗣抢着开口，“我们打算屯一点备用物资。”明日香看到他调整了一下衣领，不让他锁骨上的吻痕露出来，不由得咬住嘴唇，免得笑出声音。

~

Misato stopped dead outside the bar. The late autumn evening gloom had descended（-降临） and it was made even darker by the lonely streets. Somehow, this bar managed to make everything even blacker.

“This place? This is your bar? This shit-hole?”

美里在酒吧外面停住了。暮秋的夜色降临了，使空寂的街道变得更昏暗。不知为何，这间酒吧映衬得周边环境更暗了。

“这地方？就是你们说的酒吧？狗窝还差不多！”

“Oh, don’t knock it!” Asuka shushed. She’d held onto Shinji’s arm the entire way, and Misato briefly worried she might be cutting off circulation to the poor boy’s extremities（-四肢）. Still, he seemed happy enough and they whispered at each other, walking a few steps behind her. Of course, they were absolutely besotted（-沉迷的，爱得发狂） with one another. It’d be like this for a while, she wagered（-打赌）. Puppy love. But who cared? Maybe this way, they’d get at least a few years to be stupid kids. She wanted nothing more than that for them and in this weird way, in a way that resembled virtually（-实际上） no adolescence ever experienced during the course of human history, it looked like they might just get it.（-不知道这句怎么翻，先放着）

“喔，别那么扫兴！”明日香嘘声说。她一路上紧紧搂住真嗣的胳膊，美里片刻之间有想过她会不会把这可怜男孩的手臂整麻了。不过，她还是很高兴，他们在她几步之遥的地方亲昵细语。当然，他们现在就是爱得如痴如狂，她打赌这种状态还得持续好一段时间。小猫小狗的恋情。但谁管呢？也许通过这种方法，他们还能像两个傻傻的小孩子一样玩耍个几年。这完全满足了她对他们的期待，

She followed them into the bar and took a seat next to Asuka, with Shinji playing bartender（-酒侍）. The teens seemed unconcerned by the scattered mounds of（-一堆） clothing left behind by raptured bar patrons, but they gave Misato the willies（-心里发毛）.

“What’s on the menu tonight, Liebchen?”

“Um, let’s see—we had a caipirinha and a daiquiri last time, I think.”（-凯匹林纳鸡尾酒和代基里酒）

“All the sugar gave me an awful hangover.”

她跟着他们进入酒吧，挑了明日香边上的座位，真嗣则担任酒侍。少年和少女似乎对那些喝得正尽兴的酒客们留下的散落一地的衣物毫不在意，虽然美里看着心里直发毛。

“今晚轮到哪一种酒了，Liebchen（亲爱的）？”

“唔，让我看看——我们上次喝的是凯匹林纳鸡尾酒和代基里酒。”

“那些糖分多得让我第二天只想吐。”

“You’ve been going through the book alphabetically（-按字母顺序排列）,” Misato observed. “That’s—one way to do it.”

“The Aviation was still the best,” Asuka declared. “The Blood and Sand was the worst. And it looked like LCL. Seriously. Shinji can make you one.”

“I’ll pass. Shinji, can you just hand me a beer?”

“你俩毕竟是按照字母顺序来尝试的。”美里审视着，“所以不免喝到差劲的。”

“碧血黄沙是最烂的，看起来跟LCL没什么区别。我不开玩笑，让真嗣给你弄一杯看看。”

“我选择不要。真嗣，能给我一瓶啤酒吗？”

“Uh, sure. Asuka, there aren’t really any interesting cocktails that start with ‘E’—how about a French 75?”

Soon, they all had drinks. They raised them together, sipped, and Misato watched as Asuka all but drained her cocktail.

“Woah, slow down! That’s not how you’re supposed to drink a cocktail.”

“But it’s tasty.”

“呃，可以。明日香，我真的找不到E打头值得一尝的鸡尾酒——要不就跳到法兰西75吧？”

很快，他们都喝上了。他们一同举起酒杯，品尝起来，美里看着明日香几乎把她的鸡尾酒一饮而尽。

“哇哦，慢点喝！喝鸡尾酒不该这么快的！”

“但很好喝嘛。”

“But you’ll get drunk too fast and you’ll be a mess.”

“But that’s what you do.”

Misato forced herself to hold her gaze with Asuka.

“But I’m an adult. I have a bit more of a tolerance. And this is just beer.”

“Fine! Shinji, make me another and I’ll drink that one slow.”

“That’s—not how it works…” she started to say but Shinji was already fixing another cocktail. Well, what would it hurt?

“但如果喝太快，你很快就会醉成一滩烂泥。”

“那不就是你喜欢干的吗。”

美里强迫自己的眼神咬着明日香不放。

“但我可是成年人。我的酒量更好。而且这只是啤酒罢了。”

“行！真嗣，那再给我一杯，我这次喝得慢点。”

“我也不是指……这个意思……”她想说的时候真嗣早已倒了另一杯。行吧，多喝几杯又有何妨？

A few drinks later, Misato stopped caring what they were drinking. Vaguely（-迷糊地）, in the back of her mind, she knew she should try to be more of a guardian here, should try to protect them and teach them—something—but had she herself ever learned whatever lesson this was supposed to be?

“That’s the thing about Instrumentality,” she declared, raising another glass. “No beer. Who ever thought that was going to work? Seriously.”

Asuka laughed. A bit too loud. She was drunk too, though, Misato thought with a silly grin and leaned on the girl.

“I’m so glad we’re all back together. It’ll be just like before, but better. I promise.”

几杯下去，美里已经不管他们喝多喝少了。在大脑的某个角落，她迷迷糊糊地想着，她应该更像个监护人，保护他们，教导他们——什么的——但她自己学到的功课又有什么和现在搭得上边的？

“这可是人类补完计划啊。”她举起另一杯啤酒宣告道，“说真的，没啤酒，这怎么可能进行得下去嘛！”

明日香笑了。笑得过于大声。她也醉得不轻，美里想着，嘴边挂着傻乎乎地笑，靠在女孩的身上。

“我真高兴能和你们重新团聚在一起。就跟以前一样，还会比以前更好。我保证！”

She turned her glass around. The bubbles in the beer really did remind her of LCL. How had she never seen it before?

“So, what did you guys see? In there.”

“What?” they asked, in unison, two pairs of wide eyes turning to her.

她在空中晃了晃酒杯。啤酒里的泡泡让她想起了LCL，她以前怎么都没注意到呢？

“所以，你们俩看到了什么？在那个里头。”

“什么？”两张嘴异口同声地问，两只眼睛一同睁得大大的。

“I mean, when we were all part of that big… soul.” She laughed. “I know I saw you guys in there but I can’t really remember what I saw. It was pretty dramatic and embarrassing, right?” She was blushing. “You saw me and Kaji, right?”

“Um, maybe,” Shinji murmured. “I don’t really remember.”

“There was a lot,” Asuka added.

“我的意思是，当我们都变成了那个……灵魂共同体的时候，”她笑道，“我记得我看见你们了，但是我记不得看见了什么。特别戏剧化，又很羞耻的玩意，对吧？”她脸红了。“你们看见我和加持了，对吧？”

“呃，也许吧，”真嗣咕哝，“我不记得了。”

“太混乱了。”明日香说。

“You guys are sweet. Well, whatever you saw, just remember—I made some mistakes when I was a kid. So try to learn from them.”

“Being with Kaji was not a mistake,” Asuka growled suddenly. “It could never be.”

“Oh, I don’t mean that,” Misato giggled. “Just—spending a week in his bed. That’s not really responsible. But you can be silly when you’re young.” She sighed. “You two get a chance to be silly now. No more Angels. No more EVAs.”

“It already sounds boring,” Asuka sighed. “Even if NERV was awful.”

“你们两个真贴心。好吧，不管你们看到了什么，只要记住——我是小孩的时候，我也会犯错。你们可以从我的错误里多学点。”

“和加持在一起，可不是个错误。”明日香突然抱怨道，“不可能是错误。”

“噢，我不是说这个，”美里咯咯笑道，“只是——整整一周都和他在床上。这是不负责任的行为。不过你们趁年轻，可以多疯一点。”她叹道，“你们现在得到了疯的机会。没有使徒，也没有EVA了。”

“听起来够无聊。”明日香叹息，“虽然NERV也很糟糕。”

“Being a kid is supposed to be boring. You’re supposed to study hard and hate your parents and lose your mind from worrying about getting into university. You’re supposed to have crushes on people who’ll never love you back and try things and be disappointed when you suck at them. And then, you think back on it, and you wish you could go back and try it all over, and you know you can’t. But there’s something kind of bittersweet in it. That longing.”

“当个孩子就是很无聊的。你本就应该好好学习，痛恨你们的父母，为能否考上好大学的问题愁得不可开交。你们本就应该爱上那些从来不会爱你们的人，放手去爱，到手以后又失望不已。然而之后当你回想起这一切，开始希望能够穿越回去让一切重新来过，你就知道你已经办不到了。但那其中仍然有许些苦涩的甜蜜，将会持久地存在。”

They were watching her. God, what am I talking about?

“Sorry, I’m drunk,” she giggled. “NERV was awful, though. I’m—sorry. That I helped bring you two into it.”

“It wasn’t your fault,” Shinji said softly. “It was my dad. And SEELE.”

他们都看着她。上帝，我在讲什么呀？

“抱歉，我喝醉了，”她咯咯笑，“NERV是很糟啦。我——对不起你们。是我把你们俩搞进去的。”

“不是你的错。”真嗣温和地说，“是我爸，还有SEELE。”

“Mhm,” Misato murmured. “I’d like to get my hands on any of your dad’s notes. Files. Records. Whatever. I wonder if they survived. Maybe not at NERV but Fuyutsuki might have kept something off-site…”

“What’s the point?” Asuka grunted. “It’s over. They’re all gone.”

“People will want to know,” Misato said. “Eventually. When they start coming back. We might be the first but I bet there’ll be others soon. Like waking up from the party of the century—the millennium—with a wicked hangover and no idea what happened. The world will be different from now on but we get to take a few deep breaths right now before it changes even more.”

“嗯……”美里发着含糊不清的声音，“我可以找找你爸爸的日记。文件。记录啥的。我在想还有没有留下来的。也许不在NERV本部，冬月可能还保存着不为人知的……”

“有什么意义？”明日香抱怨道，“已经结束了。都是过去的事情了。”

“人们总是想弄明白，”美里说，“最终，当他们都回来的时候，他们会想知道发生了什么。我们可能是第一批，但我打赌肯定会有更多人醒来，就像从一场世纪的狂欢盛宴——千禧之年苏醒，他们的头脑依然被邪恶的宿醉感蒙裹着，摸不清究竟发生了什么。世界早已天翻地覆，但我们仍需多做几次深呼吸，时刻预备着它更进一步的变更。”

“What if I don’t want them to know what happened?” Asuka muttered. There was a dark look on her face.

“But it’s not just up to you! All of humanity was involved.”

“And they all saw into my soul! I don’t want to see any of them again!” she yelled suddenly. She flung her glass at the floor and Misato squeaked as it shattered.

“如果我不想让他们知道发生了什么呢？”明日香嘟囔道。她的表情很阴沉。

“但不是你能决定的！整个人类种族都被卷了进去。”

“所有人都把我的灵魂看了个精光！我不想再见到他们中的任何一个混账家伙！”她突然叫起来，把她的酒杯丢在地上，摔成了碎片，美里惊叫一声。

She was about to reprimand the girl when Shinji appeared behind her with a broom.

“Hey,” he whispered, and said something to her and she took his arm like a child grabbing a favorite toy. She wrapped it around her shoulders, placing herself in a sort of headlock and gripping his forearm. He kept whispering and she nuzzled her face against his shoulder.

“Sorry,” she said, finally. “I’m kind of drunk.”

她正要安抚女孩，真嗣却出现在她身后，拿着一把笤帚。

“嘿，”他轻声招呼，对她的姑娘说了什么，她握住他的手臂，就像一个孩子抓住了心爱的玩具，把它绕在自己的肩膀上，围巾一样地裹着自己，并紧紧抓着他的前臂。他继续低声说话，她扭着脑袋，脸埋进了他的肩头。

“对不起，”最后，她终于说，“我好像有点喝醉了。”

“It’s fine,” Misato said as Shinji let her go. He began to sweep up the glass and when he disappeared to throw it out, she whispered: “He really takes care of you.”

“Don’t say that.”

“Why? It’s sweet. It shows how much he likes you. And understands you.”

Her face flushed redder than even the French 75’s had managed. She bowed her head until Shinji came back and the look she gave him was veiled from Misato by her red tresses.

“没关系。”真嗣放开她的时候，美里说。他开始扫碎玻璃，去倒垃圾的时候，美里小声说：“他真的好好地照顾着你呢。”

“别这么说。”

“为什么？明明很甜蜜。说明他真的很爱你。而且理解你的想法。”

她的脸红得比法兰西75带来的效果还要更甚。她低着脑袋直到真嗣回来，美里给他的眼神被她的红色秀丽长发掩盖了。

“之前在这里发生了不小的矛盾，”真嗣说，“我们两个之间的。但是当我们醒来以后，我们好好地谈过了。”

“We had some intense moments, in there,” Shinji began. “The two of us. But we talked it out when we woke up.”

“I’m glad,” Misato said, and poured the rest of her beer into her glass.

“I don’t like people I don’t know being able to see into my soul,” Asuka murmured once more. “Or even people I know. I think a little privacy isn’t too much to ask.”

“Well, the good thing is that it’s so hard to focus on any one soul’s experiences—no one will remember what they saw. I mean, I barely remember anything from in there.” She thought for a second. “There was a train. And then our kitchen.”

Their heads whipped around to stare at her.

“And a hospital. But that’s all I remember. Just… places.”

“Yeah,” Shinji said after a few moments of thought. “Me too.”

“我很高兴，”美里说，把剩下的啤酒倒进她的杯子里。

“我不喜欢陌生人能看到我心里的所思所想。”明日香再次开口低语，“甚至包括我认识的人。我想保留一点点隐私应该不过分吧。”

“不过，好的事情是很难去专注于不同个体灵魂的经历——没有人会记得他们看见了什么。我的意思是，连我也不记得发生了什么。”她想了一秒钟，“嗯，那里有个火车，还有我们的厨房。”

他们的眼神齐刷刷地望向她。

“还有个医院。但这些就是我能记住的全部了。就只是……场所罢了。”

“是啊，”经过片刻的思考，真嗣说，“我也是如此。”

~

The next day, she was sick and not just from her hangover（宿醉）. The cramps had hit hard and she sent Shinji out early to find ibuprofen（布洛芬消炎药）. Between the ache in her skull and the ache in her gut, she barely had room to think. Instead, she stayed in bed till the late afternoon, wishing Shinji would come and hold her, and not finding a voice with which to call him.

第二天，她浑身难受，而且不只是因为宿醉。痉挛发作得很厉害，她让真嗣早早地出去找布洛芬消炎药。头骨和肠胃的疼痛轮番来袭，她几乎没有思考的时间。她在床上一直躺到下午，希望真嗣能来抱抱她，又发不出声音来叫他。

They’d slept next to one another, and in the dark anonymity of the quilt, she could draw close to him and pretend she was someone else, he was someone else, and only in that way, could she be honest and say the words to herself that she’d wanted to hear him say. She felt like some primal creature, marking her mate with her scent, or maybe the other way around—maybe their scent was one now. She found this thought awoke feelings in her chest that tickled in a pleasantly terrifying way.

他们挨着睡。在被窝下的无名黑暗里，她可以靠近他，假装她是另一个人，他是另一个人，只有这样，她才能诚实地对自己说那些她想听他说的话。她觉得自己就像某种原始的生物，用她的气味来标记她的伴侣，或者也许反过来说--也许他们的气味已经趋同了——这种想法以一种令人愉快的恐怖方式挠得她心里发痒。

Everything had moved so fast. But should she be surprised? After all, they’d known each other for so long. No, that wasn’t true either. They’d known each other for less than a year. But what they’d experienced together could fill a lifetime. She’d felt deep recesses（休会） of his soul—his literal soul—and he’d known her in virtually every way it was possible to know someone so who was to say this was moving too fast?

It scared her. How quickly she could lose her hatred for him. How quickly the hatred turned to… something else entirely.

She shouldn’t forgive him, just because she wanted his warmth. Just because he could be so kind to her that it gutted her（使她心碎，gut-掏空）. Just because he could dispel（驱散） loneliness with a touch or a look.

她被吓到了。她对他的憎恨消失得多么快啊。仇恨是多么迅速地转变成了......完全不同的东西。

她不应该轻易原谅他，只因为她想要他的温暖。只因为他能对她那么好，以至于让她心碎，肠子都掏空了。仅仅因为他可以用一个触摸或一个眼神来扫除她的孤独。

Anything he gave her, she reminded herself, could be taken away. The pain of loss, she knew, was worse than the pleasure of love. If her mother had taught her anything, it was this.

Still—

Maybe—

This would be—

Different. Maybe it wouldn’t hurt.

她提醒自己，他给她的任何东西都可以被再度夺走。她知道，失去的痛苦比爱的快乐更可怕。如果她母亲教会了她什么，那就是这个道理。

只是——

也许——

这一次会不一样。

也许这一次，她不会再受伤了。

There was a dark little flame in her chest that wouldn’t go out. It stoked itself on the pleasure of possessing him, and his kindness was kindling to the fire. No matter what she tried, how she reminded herself of how damned they both were, it refused to die. Pathetic. Utterly pathetic, she thought. But still: she couldn’t help, in her quiet moments, as she lay with him or watched him hum as he cooked for her, as he held her, as she clawed him and kissed him, leaving marks that would brand him as hers, she couldn’t help at these times but to draw inside her chest for a moment and hold the flame in her hands. It burned, certainly, but it was beautiful and it was spreading.（-这就是开头介绍，写得真美）

有一簇黑暗的小小火苗，在她的胸口潜伏不出。它趁着占有他的喜悦掇弄自己，他的温柔使它持续燃烧。无论有多少次她尝试，无论她如何提醒自己，他们两个多么糟糕不堪，它始终不肯熄灭。多可怜啊，多可悲，她心想。然而，某些时刻，她无法忍耐，当安静的时分，她依偎着他；当他为她做饭的时候听他哼歌，当他拥她入怀，当她擒吻着他，留下那标志着他属于她的印记，她忍不住会在心里描摹出火苗的样子，用双手捧住。当然很灼烫，但却是美丽的，而且还在蔓延。

It was late. I should get up, before they worry about me, she thought. The thought surprised her. They might worry about her. It was something she would have struggled to imagine once. Now, though, she believed it.

天色已晚。我应该起床了，在他们为我担心之前，她想道。这个想法让她吃惊。他们可能会担心她。这是她曾经难以想象的事情。但现在，她相信了。

~

“She’s really out of it, huh?” Misato asked him at lunch as he sat down.

“Yeah. The pills really bothered her stomach, she said. I guess it’s to be expected.”

“Right. It can’t be helped. It was sweet of you to go get her painkillers.” Misato winked at him. “And me. First hangover since coming back.”

“It was no problem. I had a headache too,” he chuckled, picking at his bowl. He couldn’t muster much of an appetite. Mostly, he prayed Misato wouldn’t ask him any questions he’d find hard to answer. Not about what had happened.

“她直接睡过去了，是不？”午饭时分，真嗣一坐下，美里就问他。

“嗯。她说那些药让她肚子很不舒服。我想这在情理之中。”

“是啊。派不上用处。你去给她找止痛药，真贴心啊。”美里朝真嗣使眼色。“还有我。回来以后”

“我也犯头疼。”他轻笑一声，举起碗。他没什么胃口。大多数时间他都在祈祷美里小姐不会问出让他犯难的问题。不要问发生了什么。

“Say, Shinji,” she murmured after a few minutes of quiet. “Remember what I said the last time I saw you?”

“Um,” he stammered, looking down at his plate. “When we, uh, kissed?”

Misato giggled. “Yeah. About the adult stuff that comes after that? I guess you’ll have to forget about that now.”

“I guess.”

“说起来，真嗣，”几分钟的安静后，她咕哝着说，“记得我上次见你，我对你说的话吗？”

“呃，”他结巴地说，低头看餐盘，“你……亲我的时候？”

美里咯咯笑道：“是啊，还有剩下的事情。我猜你必须忘掉这些。”

“我猜是的。”

“I can’t say I’m not at least a teeny-tiny bit jealous of Asuka,” she said, leaning back. “But I’m happy for you two. Really. If there’s anything I can do or anything you need—if you want me out of the apartment sometimes or—or even if you guys want a place to yourself—“

“我不能说我对明日香有那么一丁点的嫉妒。”她靠回椅子上说，“但我为你们两个高兴。如果有什么我能为你们俩做的——如果你们想让我有时离开公寓——或许你们想要完全清静的私人空间——”

“No!” He blushed. “I mean, it’s nice, all of us, living here. And there’s already stuff here and everything. All our things and food and everything.” He was sputtering and he hoped she couldn’t trace the anxiety and guilt in his voice. “I suppose we could take one of these empty apartments in the building but—“

“Why bother? Good. That’s kind of how I feel. I’m tired of being lonely. I didn’t think I’d miss you guys as much as I did. Even though we were all together, it didn’t feel like it, did it?”

“不是！”他脸红了，“我的意思是，我们三人都住在这里，挺好的。这里已经塞满了各种补给品。我们的日常所需，食物还有其他的。”他，他希望她不会察觉他声音里的惊慌和愧疚。“我想我们可以在这栋楼里找个空的公寓，但是——”

"何必呢？行吧。这就是我的感觉。我已经厌倦了孤独的生活。我没想到我会这么想念你们。尽管在补完里我们都融合了，但感觉并不喜欢，不是吗？" “No. I don’t think Instrumentality worked. Or maybe I did it wrong. But I didn’t feel calm or happy or loved or anything in there. Just—numb. A little sad. Scared. Bored. Lonely.”

“Exactly. Nothing too awful—“

Speak for yourself, Shinji retorted silently.

“—but is it worth giving up your individuality for? I don’t think so. Not for me, at least. Maybe there’s something wrong with me too.”

"嗯。我不认为人类补完计划起作用了。也可能是我弄错了。反正我在那里没有感觉到平静，或快乐，或被爱，或任何东西。只是-很麻木。有一点悲伤。害怕。无聊。孤独。"

"正是如此。没有什么太可怕的--"

说你自己吧，真嗣默默地反驳道。

"但那值得放弃自身的个性吗？我不这么认为。至少对我来说不是。也许我自己也有问题。"

She shifted again and winced.

“Is there something wrong?”

“Oh, it’s nothing, really. When I woke up, I had a big scab（疤） from where I got shot and it’s been throbbing. I should take a look at it, I guess. I don’t want it to get infected right now.”

她挪了挪姿势，缩了一下。

“有哪里不对吗？”

“哦，没事，真的没事。我醒来的时候，被枪击中的地方有一个很大的疤痕，刺疼刺疼的。我想我应该检查一下。我不想它现在被感染。”

Shinji nodded. “Asuka has some scars from—what happened.”

“She must be self-conscious about them.”

“Yeah, I think she definitely is.”

真嗣点点头。“那些事——让明日香留下了疤痕。”

“她对那些伤疤一定很有自觉。”

“是啊，我也认为她肯定有。”

“You need to be very supportive about that, you know. A girl’s body image is very fragile.（脆弱）” She touched the spot on her chest where Shinji knew an old, healed scar rested. “Ugly boys get pretty girls all the time. Just look at your mom and dad. No offense.”

“你需要给她精神上的支持。一个女孩对外表印象的自信是很脆弱的。”她碰了碰她的胸口，真嗣知道那里有一道愈合的旧疤痕。“懒蛤蟆总是能吃上天鹅肉。看看你爸妈的结合就知道了。无意冒犯。”

She winked and he grinned.

“But girls are conditioned to be self-conscious. It’s cruel, but that’s how it is. And you two are so young. You can never miss an opportunity to make her feel beautiful, okay? I wish… I’ll leave it there, actually.”

她使了个眼色，他会心一笑。

“但是女孩子被置于一种需要自尊自爱的状态。这很残酷，但就是事实。你们两个都还年轻。你决不能错过任何一个让她感觉自己很漂亮的机会，行吗？我希望……我不会再多说了。”（-翻到这里我愈发觉得作者是女性）

Shinji nodded. He felt he should say something, but the smile on Misato’s face assured him that nothing more was needed. She reached to toss her empty beer can in the trash but gave a small gasp.

“Yeah. I definitely need to do something about this stupid thing.”

“I dressed Asuka’s wounds. Do you want me to take a look at it?”

真嗣颔首。他觉得他应该说些什么，但美里脸上的笑容告诉他无需多言。她伸手把空瓶子丢进垃圾桶，呼吸又一滞。

“哎。我得好好地把这愚蠢的伤口料理一下了。”

“我处理过明日香的伤口。你想让我看看它吗？”

“Oh, man, Shinji, would you? Honestly, I’m such a baby about things like this. Ritsuko always made fun of me, but I go to pieces over a paper cut. Other people’s blood doesn’t do anything for me, but the sight of my own freaks me out（吓晕）.” She smiled, and he saw a drop of sweat slide down her temple. “Ever since the Second Impact.”

“喔，我的真嗣宝贝啊，你会吗？老实说，我对这种事超级没辙的。律子总是取笑我，但我真的是容易大惊小怪。他人的血完全不能唬到我，但我自己的血却能把我吓得半死。”她微笑，他看见她的额骨上淌下一滴汗。“自从二冲以来就是这样。”

“Are you warm?” he asked. She shrugged.

“I guess. It’s pretty hot in here, isn’t it?”

“We don’t have the heat on.”

He leaned over the table and felt her forehead.

“You’re burning up. Let me take a look at the scab?”

“你很热吗？”他问。她耸肩。

“我想是的。这里不是很热吗？”

“我们没开任何暖气。”

他探身到桌面上方，摸了摸她的额头。

“你都烫坏了。让我看看你的伤吧。”

They moved to the living room and Misato stripped her shirt off. Shinji found himself almost blushing at the sight—she wasn’t wearing a bra—but Misato crossed her arms a second later.

“Sorry. But it’s not like it’s anything you haven’t seen, huh?”

“Um, yeah. I guess.”

He knelt and peered close at the gnarled rupture（多节疙瘩） of flesh, ringed with red. He pressed it with his finger and she winced（畏缩）. A dribble of pale yellow pus（脓） slithered out.

“I think it’s infected,” he sighed. “I can go to the pharmacy（药店） and get antibiotics（抗生素）. In the meanwhile, I guess—I should drain it, probably? And clean it?”

“Right,” Misato nodded. She had bent her head back, so she stared at the ceiling. “If you can find a needle or something, you can sterilize（灭菌） it with the burner on the stove. Or anything sharp, really.” She sighed. “Can I stop thinking about it and just turn that part over to you?”

“You relax,” he said, voice soft. “I’ll get this cleaned up before you know it.”

他们移动到了客厅，美里脱掉了她的衬衫。真嗣发现自己差点没脸红——她没有穿胸罩——好在美里在一秒钟后立刻交叉抱胸。

"对不起。但这又不是什么你没见过的东西，嗯？"

"嗯，是啊。我想应该。"

他跪下来，靠近看了看那块参差不齐的伤痕裂口，红红的。他用手指按住它，然后把它放回原处。他用手指轻按了一下，她畏缩了。一滴淡黄色的脓液渗了出来。

"我想它被感染了，"他叹了口气。"我可以去药店买抗生素。我想我应该把脓液放掉，这样子？然后清洗它？"

"对。"美里点了点头。她向后弯脖子，盯着天花板看。"如果你能找到一根针或其他东西，你可以用炉子上的燃烧器来消毒。或任何尖锐的东西，都行。" 她叹了口气。"我可以不去想它，直接把这部分交给你吗？"

"你放轻松，"他说，声音很温柔。"我会在你意识到之前就把你的伤口清晰完毕。"

He couldn’t find a needle, but there was a small scalpel in a neglected NERV-issued first aid kit stashed under the sink in the bathroom. He held it to the burner’s blue flame until he was sure nothing could have survived it, and knelt between Misato’s knees

他找不到针头，但在浴室水槽下的一个被忽视的 NERV 配发的急救箱里有一把小手术刀。他把手术刀对着燃烧器的蓝色火焰，直到确定完全消毒，然后跪在美里的双膝之间

“Here I go,” he whispered, and Misato grabbed his free hand as he pierced the tangled mess of hardened flesh.

他低声说："来了。"美里抓住他的空手，因为他刺穿了纠缠在一起的硬肉。

It was over in moments. He cleaned her up, wiped down the area with an antiseptic（抗菌剂）, and wrapped her belly with medical tape, bracing gauze（纱布） against the wound.

手术很快就结束了。他为她清理伤口，用抗菌剂擦拭伤口，用医用胶带包扎腹部，用纱布固定伤口。抵住伤口。

Misato wiped her forehead and sighed, wincing once more as she tested the bandage, twisting in the chair.

“You’re a life-saver, Shinji. Seriously.”

“It’s the least I could do. You got this protecting me.”

“Consider the favor returned.”

美里擦了擦额头，叹了口气，在测试绷带时再次抽搐起来，在椅子上扭动着身体。

"你真是救命恩人，真嗣。真的。"

"这是我最起码能做的。是你保护了我

"就当我还你一个人情吧"

“I don’t think I could ever make up for everything you’ve done for me,” he said, suddenly. She leaned forward, seeing him kneel on the floor before her. He gripped the knees of his jeans and had squeezed his eyes shut.

“Are you—crying?”

He shook his head, but she could see he was lying.

"我想我永远无法弥补你为我所做的一切，"他突然说道。她向前倾身，看到他跪在她面前的地板上。他抓着牛仔裤的膝盖，紧闭着双眼。

"你在哭吗？"

他摇了摇头，但她看得出他在撒谎。

“Oh, Shinji, Shinji,” she cooed and swept him into her arms. She pressed his face to her neck. “It’s over now. It’s all over. We’re safe. You. Me. Asuka. We’re all safe. No one’s going to hurt us anymore.”

She guided her lips to his hair and that’s when she saw the door to his room slide open.

"哦，真嗣，真嗣，"她咕哝着把他拥入怀中。她把他的脸贴在自己的脖子上。"现在都结束了。一切都结束了。我们安全了。你。我 明日香 我们都安全了 再也不会有人伤害我们了"

她把嘴唇贴在他的头发上 这时她看到他房间的门被推开了

“What’s going on here?” Asuka asked.

Misato managed a smile.

“The gunshot wound on my belly is infected. Shinji was taking care of it for me and we were reminiscing about how it happened.”

"这是怎么回事？" 明日香问道。

美里勉强笑了笑。

"我腹部的枪伤感染了。真嗣正在帮我处理伤口，我们还在回忆当时的情况。"

“When you kissed him,” Asuka all but spat out.（啐道）

“Yeah, that’s right.” Misato’s voice sounded distant. “But you don’t need to worry. That’s in the past. It was nothing.”

“Then why are you naked?” she hissed and turned back to the bedroom. The door clattered as she slammed it shut.

Shinji sat back on his heels（站稳脚跟）, wiping his eyes.

“Sorry. Asuka is—a little possessive of me, I think.”

"当你吻他的时候，"明日香啐道。

"是啊，没错。" 美里的声音听起来很遥远。"不过你不用担心。那都是过去的事了。没什么大不了的。"

"那你为什么光着身子？"她嘶吼着转身回到卧室。她砰的一声关上了门。

真嗣坐在脚跟上（站稳脚跟），擦了擦眼睛。

"对不起。我想明日香对我有点占有欲。

“She’s a teenaged girl. Of course she is. She acted like this with Kaji and she wasn’t even in a relationship with him.” Misato sighed and lifted herself back to the chair. “Go and make sure she’s okay. I’ve survived this long. I can wait another hour or two for the antibiotics.”

"她还是个年轻女孩。 她就是这样。她甚至对没有和她谈过恋爱的加持也是这样的。" 美里叹了口气，重新坐回椅子上。"去确保她没事。我已经活了这么久了。我可以再等等抗生素一两个小时。"

“You’re sure?”

“Go. In retrospect（回溯往事）—we could have done this differently. We should have. Things are different now. I need to remember that. It’s my fault.”

The smile on her face was desperately sad, if only for how hard she was clearly trying to keep it from looking sad. Shinji wanted to cry again.

“Go.”

"你确定？"

"去吧。回溯往事--我们本可以采取不同的方式。我们应该这样做。现在情况不同了。我必须记住这一点。这是我的错。

她脸上的笑容让人感到绝望，如果只是因为她很努力地想让自己看起来不那么悲伤的话。真嗣又想哭了。

"去吧"

~

As she expected, he came to her, groveling（低声下气）, to apologize. She curled up in his bed, faced away from him, and when he put his arm on her, she threw it off.

不出她所料，他来到她身边，卑躬屈膝地向她道歉。她蜷缩在他的床上，面对着他，当他把胳膊搭在她身上时，她甩开了。

“You already broke the rule,” she growled after listening to his pathetic excuses for fifteen minutes. “Talked to another woman. I let it slide, because it’s Misato. But then I find her tits（奶子）all over you.”

"你已经违反规定了，"在听了他可悲的借口十五分钟后，她咆哮道。"你和另一个女人说话。因为是美里，我就没管。但后来我发现她的奶子都在你身上"。

“Asuka, you saw me crying. Do you think I was enjoying that?”

She turned over.

“Were you? Misato’s big tits. You think about them, don’t you? You’ve masturbated to them? Don’t lie to me. I’ll know.”（-233）

“That’s not the point.”

“That’s exactly the point.”

“I don’t know what you want me to be.”

“Mine. That’s all. It’s simple.”

“Then say that.”

“No. Say what you feel.”

"明日香 你看到我哭了 你觉得我很享受吗？"

她翻了个身

"你喜欢吗？美里的大奶子。 你想过它们，是吗？你对着它们自慰过吗？别骗我了 我会知道的。"（233）

"这不是重点"

"这正是重点"

"我不知道你想让我成为什么样的人"

"我的人。就这样 很简单"

"那就说出来"

"不，说出你自己的感觉"

“Would it make a difference?” She turned to face him. He had been crying, she saw, but she knew her face was dry. There was power in this. She distorted（扭曲） her voice: “’Oh, Shinji, I’m so in love with you. Please, let’s get married and go live in a fairy castle beyond the sea. I want to have babies with you. I just love you so much!’”

"这有什么区别吗？" 她转身面对他。她看到他一直在哭，但她知道她的脸是干的。这就是力量。她扭曲她的声音："'哦，真嗣，我好爱你。求你了，让我们结婚吧，去海边的童话城堡生活。我想和你生孩子。我太爱你了！'"

“I don’t want that.”

“Then what do you want?”

“For you to—be nice to me. Be honest with me.”

“You wouldn’t like that either,” she growled. They watched each other, animals locked in a cage together.

“Go ahead. You could strangle me now,” she whispered. “Run away with Misato. She’ll be everything you want.”

"我不想那样"

"那你想要什么？"

"希望你对我好一点。对我诚实一点"

"你也不会喜欢的，"她咆哮道。他们互相看着对方，就像被关在笼子里的动物。

"来吧。你现在可以掐死我，"她低声说。"然后和美里私奔吧 她会是你想要的一切。"

“What do you think I want?”

“A lover and a mother. I can barely be one of those.”

That did it. He collapsed into the desk chair near the bed, caught his face in his palm.

“I told you. Being trapped with me would be hell,” she whispered. “Go away. I don’t want to see you right now.”

He started to say something but the tears garbled（混淆） it.

“I know I’m being awful. But I don’t care. This is what you get for hurting me. And now you’ll leave like everyone else leaves.”

"你觉得我想要什么？"

"爱人和母亲。 我几乎不可能成为这样的人。"

就这样。 他倒在床边的办公椅上，用手掌捂住了脸。

"我告诉过你。 和我困在一起简直是地狱。"她低声说道。"走开吧。我现在不想见到你。"

他刚想说什么，但泪水把他的声音弄混淆了。

"我知道我很糟糕。但我不在乎。这就是你伤害我的报应。现在你要像其他人一样离开我。"

“I need to get medicine for Misato.”

“I know. Go.”

“You told me to go.”

“Go,” she hissed.

"我得去给美里拿药。"

"我知道。 去吧。"

"是你让我去的。"

"去吧，" 她嘶吼道。

He didn’t. He pushed her over. No, no, no, she thought. Don’t do this. His arms descended on her once more and she couldn’t fight it.

“I’m not leaving yet,” his voice, quavering, told her. “If this is what you need to hear—“

他没有走， 他把她推倒了。不，不，不，她想。别这样。 他的手臂再次向她伸来，她无法反抗。

"我还不会走，"他颤抖的声音告诉她。"如果这就是你想听的......"

And he whispered it in her ear. She shook in his arms as the tears burst. She said it back to him, and immediately regretted it, and then decided she didn’t regret it, and then decided she could both regret and not regret it.

他在她耳边低语。她在他的怀里颤抖着，泪水夺眶而出。她回过头来对他说了这句话，马上就后悔了，然后又觉得自己不后悔，接着又觉得自己既可以后悔，也可以不后悔。

He told her lots of things. Too many things to keep track of. Some theory about their hearts being tied up together or something. He drew a little diagram（示意图） on the wall before her eyes with his finger, as if these invisible marks would prove something. He kept drawing a triangle（三角形） and putting them at the top and he had all sorts of dumb ideas about what the other two corners were. But he held her attention, because he held her. He kept coming back to hold her, no matter how badly she tried to hurt him, and this had to be something. This had to be real. The dark flame had burned out of control and consumed her heart.

他告诉了她很多事情。太多了，记不清了 一些关于他们的心绑在一起的理论什么的。他用手指在她眼前的墙上画了一个小图表 仿佛这些看不见的痕迹能证明什么似的 他不停地画着三角形，并把它们放在顶端，对于其他两个角是什么，他有各种愚蠢的想法。但他吸引了她的注意力，因为他抓住了她。无论她多么想伤害他，他都会回来抱着她。这一定是真实的。黑暗的火焰一发不可收拾，吞噬了她的心。

“Shinji, I’ll try,” she remembered whispering at one point. “I’ll try to be better but I can’t promise it. Please, please don’t leave me. Please don’t despair of me. Please just keep holding me.”

And so he kept holding her, until dreams took her away.

"真嗣，我会努力的，"她记得自己在某一个时间窃窃私语。"我会努力变得更好，但我不能保证。求求你，不要离开我。请不要对我绝望 请一直抱着我"

就这样，他一直抱着她 直到梦把她带走

~

“Sounds like you two cried it out,” Misato said as he eased the door to their room closed.

“Yeah. I think we figured something out.”

She grinned. The sweat beading on her forehead glistened in the evening sun.

“Good. She’s going to be a handful（难搞的人）, you know.”

“I know.”

“But I bet you’re up to the challenge.”

"听起来你们两个哭了，"美里在他缓缓关上他们房间的门时说。

"是啊，我想我们想通了。"

她咧嘴一笑。她额头上的汗珠在傍晚的阳光下闪闪发光。

"那就好。她会是很难搞的人，你知道的。"

"我知道"

"但我打赌你一定能接受挑战"

Shinji pulled on his jacket. “I hope so.” He paused, looked at his hands, and he was smiling. “For once—I don’t want to run away.”

真嗣拉了拉外套。"但愿如此。" 他顿了顿，看了看自己的手，露出了笑容。"这一次，我不想逃跑。"
