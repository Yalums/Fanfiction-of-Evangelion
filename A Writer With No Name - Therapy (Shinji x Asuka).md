Chapter 1: First Contact (Updated)  
第一章：初次接触（更新）

I watch their final moments, unable to do anything to help them. The sea has turned red, the Evangelions are in a state of rigor mortis, Lilith's remains are all over the place. A massive face that has been cut in half watches the last two humans in existence that are still alive.  
我目睹了他们的最后时刻，却无能为力。大海已染成红色，福音战士们僵硬如尸，莉莉丝的残骸遍布各处。一张被劈成两半的巨大面孔注视着仅存的两个尚存人世的人类。

As they lie on the beach, the boy named Shinji looks to his side. I don't know what he sees, but it's not there for me to see physically. So I entered his vision and now I see his old friend Rei standing on the water, watching him with a distant look, before she disappears. So now all that's left are those two, lying on a beach looking up at the stars and moon...the moon which now has the blood of Lilith spread upon it.  
他们躺在沙滩上，名叫真嗣的男孩侧头望去。我不知道他看到了什么，但那并非我肉眼所能见。于是我进入了他的视野，现在我看到他的老朋友绫波零站在水面上，用一种遥远的目光注视着他，随后消失不见。如今只剩下他们两人，躺在沙滩上仰望星空与月亮……那月亮如今沾满了莉莉丝的鲜血。

What a shame...it was much prettier when it was a simple white orb. Now whenever I look up, I'll see that red line covering part of it, or at least some PART of it.  
真是遗憾……它原本只是一个简单的白色球体时，要美丽得多。如今每当我抬头，总会看到那条红线覆盖其上的一部分，或者至少是其中的一部分。

Shinji now moves, causing me to leave his vision as he crawls over to the girl named Asuka. She is just as confused as he, especially when Shinji gets on top of her. He takes his hands, places them across her neck and he then begins to squeeze.  
真嗣现在动了，我随之离开他的视线，他爬向那个名叫明日香的女孩。她和他一样困惑，尤其是当真嗣压在她身上时。他伸出双手，放在她的脖子上，然后开始用力挤压。

The terror that enters Asuka's eyes chills me to my core, Shinji's look of anger and hate makes me want to puke.  
明日香眼中流露出的恐惧让我心寒，真嗣那充满愤怒和仇恨的表情让我想吐。

This boy was once a shy, cowardly teenager who was unfortunate enough to end up in this situation he was currently in. Now he was a misogynistic cockhole who was blinded by his own rage.  
这个男孩曾经是个害羞、懦弱的少年，不幸地陷入当前的境地。如今他却成了一个被自己的愤怒蒙蔽双眼、厌恶女性的混蛋。

I can't do anything….but she's going to die if I don't DO something now!  
我什么都做不了……但如果我现在不采取行动，她就会死！

That's when she gently caresses his face. The rage in Shinji's eyes disappears instantly, as he feels her warm welcoming touch. He stops squeezing as he realizes what he's doing. He's terrified, shaking and he hates himself to the point where he wants to die. Though he doesn't move, not even to give Asuka space, he just...hovers over her then he starts to cry.  
就在这时，她温柔地抚摸着他的脸颊。真嗣眼中的怒火瞬间消失，他感受到了她温暖而亲切的触碰。他停止了挤压，意识到自己在做什么。他害怕得发抖，痛恨自己到了想死的地步。尽管他没有移动，甚至没有给明日香留出空间，他就那样……悬在她上方，然后开始哭泣。

While this is happening Asuka looks up into with her one good eye, looks over to Shinji and says one word, "Disgusting."  
与此同时，明日香用她那只好眼睛向上看去，转向真嗣，只说了一个词：“恶心。”

I'm then freed from my prison...the story is technically over. They are destined to repeat the same events, but I can not allow that! Not after everything they have just been through, they deserve a peaceful world, and I can give them that!  
我终于从牢笼中解脱...故事在技术上已经结束。他们注定要重复同样的事件，但我不能允许那样！经历了这一切，他们理应得到一个和平的世界，而我可以给予他们！

Although...if they go into that world straight away, they'll reject it and the world will fall into chaos. I can't believe I have to do this, but there is no other choice. I materialize onto the beach in pieces from bottom to top, first my shoes, then my pants then my shirt with a jacket and tie.  
尽管...如果他们直接进入那个世界，他们会拒绝它，世界将陷入混乱。我真不敢相信我必须这么做，但别无选择。我以从下到上的方式在海滩上实体化，先是鞋子，然后是裤子，接着是衬衫，外加一件夹克和领带。

I notice that they haven't seen me yet, so I materialize a clipboard with some paper on it along with a pen. Then I wonder towards them, my shoes slightly sinking into the sand as I walk, causing the sand to get into both of them. It would annoy me if I had feet, though I could manifest myself as a human if I decided it was necessary. For now, all I need to do is talk to them. As an afterthought I materialize some gloves so they can see my hands, though that still won't take away their shock when they see me. However it's only when I end up standing right next to them, that they both see my shoes. They look up and see me, an 'invisible creature' wearing human clothing with a clipboard and pen, on a desolate beach in a ruined world.  
我发现他们还没注意到我，于是我具现出一个夹着纸的文件夹和一支笔。然后我向他们走去，鞋子微微陷入沙中，沙粒随之钻进鞋里。如果我有脚的话，这肯定会让我感到烦躁，不过如果需要，我可以决定以人类形态出现。眼下，我只需要和他们交谈。作为事后考虑，我具现出一些手套让他们能看到我的手，尽管这仍无法消除他们见到我时的震惊。然而，直到我站到他们身边，他们才注意到我的鞋子。他们抬头看到我，一个穿着人类服装、拿着文件夹和笔的‘隐形生物’，站在一个荒废世界的荒凉海滩上。

But what happens next surprises me, they DON'T scream. They just...stare, BOTH with looks of pure confusion and terror. I make a note of it. When I look back, they're still giving me that same look.  
但接下来发生的事情让我感到意外，他们并没有尖叫。他们只是……凝视，两人脸上都带着纯粹的困惑和恐惧。我记下了这一点。当我再次看向他们时，他们仍然用同样的眼神看着我。

I look at Shinji, his tear stained eyes and broken demeanour make it clear this is the 'main package about to unwrap' as it were. While Asuka on the other hand...is stone faced and terrified down to the core. She'll be easier to deal with, but if the two ARE to end up together...THAT would take a miracle. I'm going to have to decide on what or not what should NOT be performed here. In the meantime, I HATE the look of that eye patch as well as her bandages. It would be good to have as a reminder in the future, however she WON'T be needing them where she's going.  
我看着真嗣，他泪痕斑斑的双眼和破碎的神态清楚表明，这即将是所谓的‘主要包裹即将打开’。而另一方面，明日香则面无表情，内心深处充满了恐惧。她会更容易处理，但如果他们俩真的要走到一起……那将需要一个奇迹。我必须决定哪些是不应该在这里进行的。与此同时，我讨厌那只眼罩和她的绷带。尽管如此，它们将来可以作为一个提醒，但她去的地方不需要这些东西。

I crouch down to reach for the eye patch, but I'm stopped by a hand. I look to my right, Shinji is grabbing my arm with such force and determination he might nearly break it if I were human.  
我蹲下身去拿眼罩，但被一只手拦住了。我向右看去，真嗣紧紧抓住我的手臂，力度之大，决心之坚，如果我是人类的话，他几乎能将我的手臂折断。

"Don't touch her!" he says giving me a look of pure anger and rage. His teeth were clenched and his face was stiff as a statue.  
“别碰她！”他怒吼道，眼中充满了纯粹的愤怒和狂暴。他的牙齿紧咬，脸庞僵硬如雕像。

I then hear heavy breathing, it's Asuka breathing faster and heavier due to my presence. She's scared, her eyes and face make her look as if she has pissed herself.  
随后我听到了沉重的呼吸声，是明日香，她因为我的出现而呼吸急促且沉重。她很害怕，眼神和表情让她看起来像是吓得尿了裤子。

I turn my arm through Shinji's grip like it's nothing. This surprises him as he goes back to his look of pure confusion. I then open and raise my hand, breaking out of Shinji's grip. As I do so Asuka's eye patch comes off revealing her new eye. The bandages then come off showing her arm in the best shape it has ever been in. THIS stuns them both.  
我轻松地转动胳膊，从真嗣的紧握中挣脱出来。这让他惊讶地回到了一脸茫然的状态。接着我张开并举起手，彻底摆脱了真嗣的握持。就在这时，明日香的眼罩脱落，露出了她新换的眼睛。随后绷带也解开，展现出她手臂前所未有的最佳状态。这一幕让他们两人都惊呆了。

As I stand back up to take notes, Asuka leans up almost bumping into Shinji. To look upon Asuka's new arm along with her new eye as well, she and Shinji are both slack jawed in awe. Now I could just leave them like this, to make sure they remember all of this before the repeat happens. But no...I'll be generous, I'll help these two rebuild their world.  
当我重新站起来准备做笔记时，明日香几乎要撞到真嗣。看到明日香的新手臂和新眼睛，她和真嗣都目瞪口呆，惊叹不已。现在我可以就这样离开，确保他们在重复发生之前记住这一切。但不行...我会慷慨一些，帮助这两个人重建他们的世界。
