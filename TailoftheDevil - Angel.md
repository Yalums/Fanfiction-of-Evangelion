### Chapter 1: I Live With Two Beautiful Angels!  
第一章：我与两位美丽天使同住！  

_Another name for this story could be: **The Asuka Langley Soryu Raising Project**. But I have a fetish for one-word story titles, so that didn't happen xD This story is slightly based on, yes you guessed it, **The Shinji Ikari Raising Project**! The manga, although the video game will have its references scattered around the story, here and there. Shinji starts out a lot more upbeat than he would normally be, but there is a reason for that, so bear with me!  
这个故事的另一个名字可能是：《惣流·明日香·兰格雷养成计划》。但我对单字标题情有独钟，所以没有采用那个名字 xD 这个故事在一定程度上是基于——没错，你猜对了——《碇真嗣养成计划》！虽然是以漫画为基础，但游戏中也会散落一些相关参考。真嗣一开始比平时要开朗得多，但这背后是有原因的，请耐心听我道来！_

The gentle rays of the morning sun peeked through the small gap in the curtain, reflecting the slowly falling dust floating lazily to the floor. The light managed to reach the face of a teenage boy who was fast asleep. A peaceful expression was etched on his face as he continued to enjoy a pleasant dream.  
清晨的阳光温柔地透过窗帘的缝隙，映照着缓缓飘落的尘埃，慵懒地落向地面。光线恰好照在了一个熟睡的少年脸上。他面带安详的表情，继续沉浸在美好的梦境中。

Mere inches away from him, a girl was breathing heavily, a furious, bright red blush on her face. She had light brown hair that she normally kept tied in twintails, but having woken up not that long ago, it lay tousled as she leaned over the sleeping boy, wrestling with her emotions. Her soft blue eyes looked over his face as loose strands of her hair fell over his nose and cheek.  
离他仅几英寸远的地方，一个女孩正急促地呼吸着，脸上泛起一片鲜艳的绯红。她有着浅棕色的头发，平时总是扎成双马尾，但因为刚醒来不久，头发凌乱地垂在熟睡的男孩上方，内心挣扎不已。她柔软的蓝眼睛凝视着他的脸庞，几缕发丝轻轻落在他的鼻尖和脸颊上。

She was debating whether or not to wake him normally, as was her intention when she first walked into this room, or to wake him with a raunchy morning kiss. Compounding the problem was the fact that she had only recently realised, within the last week or so, that she was madly in love with this boy. The soul with the name Shinji Ikari had been her childhood friend since forever, but her feelings had been evolving, growing and growing to the point where she could no longer deny that the spell had been cast.  
她在犹豫是像最初走进这房间时的打算那样正常叫醒他，还是用一个挑逗的早安吻来唤醒他。问题更加复杂的是，她最近才意识到，大约就在上周左右，她已经疯狂地爱上了这个男孩。名为碇真嗣的灵魂自幼便是她的青梅竹马，但她的感情一直在变化，不断增长，直到她再也无法否认那个魔咒已经降临。

She leaned in closer, close enough that she could feel his gentle breathing tickling the tip of her nose. Her mind was pretty much made up. Edging closer and closer to the prize, she began to close her eyes as she readied herself. This was going to be her first kiss.  
她更靠近了些，近到能感受到他轻柔的呼吸拂过她鼻尖。她的心意已决。她一步步接近目标，准备就绪时开始闭上眼睛。这将是一个初吻。

Nanometres away from Shinji's lips, she was seconds away from success when a grouchy voice echoed from the other room.  
距离碇真嗣的唇仅剩纳米之遥，她即将成功之际，另一间房里传来了一个不悦的声音。

"Asuka! How long does it take to wake a teenage boy? You're both gonna be late for school!"  
"明日香！叫醒一个青春期男孩要多久？你们上学都要迟到了！"

Their guardian, Misato Katsuragi, could be heard swigging a morning beer as she busied herself getting ready. Asuka could hear footsteps moving closer to the door, causing her to panic.  
他们的监护人，葛城美里，一边忙着准备，一边可以听到她在喝早上的啤酒。明日香听到脚步声越来越靠近门，这让她感到慌张。

"Just give me a second Misato!" Sighing with regret, she began to shake her unrequited love's shoulder until groaning could be heard.  
"再给我一秒钟，美里！"" 她叹了口气，带着遗憾开始摇晃她单相思的爱人的肩膀，直到听到呻吟声。

"Just another couple minutes, please..."  
“再等几分钟就好……”

"No can do Baka. We gotta get breakfast going. Hell, even Misato's awake before you today." Standing up, she made for the door. One of Shinji's eyelids cracked open, catching a glimpse of Asuka wearing a simple yellow vest top and short shorts that left very little to the imagination. As she walked out of his room, he allowed himself a small grin. He had been awake the whole time since Asuka first entered the room, keeping it secret that he was already conscious. He was aware that Asuka had been doing strange things like this for a while, but he wasn't yet quite sure how to deal with it. The girl baffled his mind. Was she in heat? He was sure if he mentioned the idea, he'd meet the receiving end of some sharp object and be a lot worse off for it. Was she in love? With him?  
“不行啊，笨蛋。我们得准备早餐了。天哪，就连美里小姐今天都比你早起。”她站起身，朝门口走去。真嗣的一只眼皮微微睁开，瞥见明日香穿着一件简单的黄色背心和短裤，几乎没遮住什么。她走出他的房间时，他忍不住微微一笑。其实从明日香刚进房间起，他就一直醒着，只是偷偷装睡。他知道明日香最近一直在做这些奇怪的事，但他还没完全弄明白该怎么应对。这个女孩让他摸不着头脑。她是在发情吗？他敢肯定，如果他提出这个想法，肯定会遭到某种尖锐物体的攻击，后果不堪设想。她是在爱恋吗？对他？

Making a sound somewhere between a snort and a chuckle, Shinji got out of bed and began to pull on his regular school clothes. He was about as attractive as a mouse, and had the charisma of a fart, there was no way in hell she was attracted to him.  
真嗣发出一声介于哼声和轻笑之间的声音，从床上爬起来，开始穿上他平常的校服。他就像只老鼠一样不起眼，魅力也不过尔尔，她怎么可能对他有意思。

But the fact was, mere moments ago, the beautiful half-European bombshell of a girl he had lived with for a considerably long time now had tried to kiss him. He had never been this confused in his entire life.  
但事实是，就在片刻之前，那个与他同居了相当长时间的美丽欧亚混血女孩，竟然试图吻他。他这辈子从未如此困惑过。

As he walked out of the room, he yawned again, already exhausted from having to think so hard this early in the morning.  
当他走出房间时，他又打了个哈欠，一大早就得这么费神，他已经感到疲惫不堪了。

"What do people want for breakfast?"  
“人们早餐想吃什么？”

In response to his question directed to the household at large, Asuka ran out of the kitchen, now wearing her regular school uniform. Forcing a slice of toast into his mouth, she ran into her room whilst yelling at him.  
面对他向全家人提出的问题，明日香从厨房冲了出来，此刻已换上了她平时的校服。她强行将一片吐司塞进嘴里，一边跑向自己的房间，一边对他大喊。

"There's no time! We've overslept, we gotta get to school, asap!"  
“没时间了！我们睡过头了，得赶紧去学校，立刻马上！”

"Wait, what about breakfast?!" A horrified Misato sounded out her fears from her bedroom. If there was no time to make something for her, she would have to make herself something. An apocalyptic scenario if there ever was one.  
“等等，那早餐怎么办？！”美里从卧室里惊恐地表达出她的担忧。如果没时间给她准备，她就得自己动手了。这简直是末日般的情景。

"Don't you start your new job today? Aren't you late?" Asuka's muffled voice echoed from her bedroom. Several seconds of silence echoed throughout the house before...  
"你今天不是开始新工作吗？不会迟到了吧？" 明日香从卧室里传来的声音有些模糊。几秒钟的沉默在家中回荡，随后...

"OH SHIT, I'M LATE!" "我靠，要迟到了！"

Shinji grinned as he wandered into his bedroom to grab his bag. First day back at school for the new semester and things were going fabulously. As he made his way to the door, the two female cohabitants barrelled out their respective bedrooms, Asuka grabbing his arm on the way out of the house, half-eaten toast hanging on for dear life as it bounced wildly from the corner of her mouth.  
真嗣笑着走进卧室去拿书包。新学期第一天返校，一切顺利得不得了。当他走向门口时，两位女室友分别从各自的卧室冲了出来，明日香在出门时抓住了他的手臂，半块吐司顽强地挂在嘴角，随着她狂奔而上下颠簸。

"Have a good day guys, watch the road, don't get hit by cars or anything." Misato yelled from her own vehicle's window as she pumped the ignition. Seconds later, she was racing down the road, speed limits be damned in their entirety.  
"祝你们今天顺利，注意看路，别被车撞了什么的。" 美里从她自己的车窗里喊道，同时发动引擎。几秒钟后，她便疾驰而去，全然不顾限速规定。

"The only car we're going to have to worry about on the roads is that damned Alpine she drives." Asuka breathed as they both ran towards the station. After a lengthy ten minute jog to the station, they touched through the station gates with their cards and just barely made the train as the doors began to close.  
"在路上我们唯一需要担心的车就是她那辆该死的阿尔派。" 明日香喘着气说，他们俩一起跑向车站。经过长达十分钟的慢跑，他们用卡片刷过车站闸门，就在车门即将关闭之际，勉强赶上了火车。

"That... was... too close..." Asuka panted as she caught her breath. Shinji nodded in agreement, eyes fixed to the floor as his lungs stopped trying to kill him. He slowly stood up, catching his balance, when his first trial of the morning began by fire.  
"那...真是...太险了..." 明日香喘着气，终于缓过气来。真嗣点头表示同意，目光紧盯着地面，他的肺部终于不再试图置他于死地。他慢慢站起身，稳住平衡，而早晨的第一个考验就这样突然降临。

His beautiful roommate was sweating from all the running they'd just finished in the sweltering Japanese summer heat, causing her white shirt to look a little see-through in certain areas. And amongst that, it seems like they had been in far too much of a hurry for her to remember to wear a bra...  
他那美丽的室友因为刚在酷热的日本夏日中奔跑而满头大汗，使得她的白衬衫在某些地方显得有些透明。而且，似乎他们当时太过匆忙，她甚至忘了穿胸罩……

He felt his face ignite as a hot, red flush crawled up his face. There was a fair amount of people crowded onto this train, and one look at the wrong angle, and Asuka might begin to be considered an exhibitionist.  
他感到自己的脸庞像被点燃了一样，一阵火热的红晕爬上了脸颊。这辆列车上挤满了人，只要一个不恰当的角度看过去，明日香就可能被误认为是暴露狂。

"Asuka..." He whispered frantically. "Come here!"  
“明日香……”他急切地低声呼唤，“过来这里！”

He received a look of confused anger for his trouble, but he didn't really care about her temper at the moment. Motioning with his hand, Asuka eventually came over to his side. He prayed to every god that would listen to protect him from the consequences of his forthcoming actions, and quickly wrapped his arms around the German girl. Her face lit up crimson as she began to try and push herself away, she wasn't anywhere near mentally prepared for Shinji's sudden forwardness.  
他为此得到了一个既困惑又愤怒的眼神，但他此刻并不太在意她的脾气。用手示意，明日香最终还是来到了他身边。他向每一位愿意倾听的神明祈祷，保佑他免受即将采取行动的后果，然后迅速用双臂环抱住这位德国女孩。她的脸颊顿时变得通红，开始试图推开他，她完全没有心理准备应对真嗣这突如其来的亲近。

"What the hell are you doing, idiot Shinji!?"  
“你到底在干什么，笨蛋真嗣？！”

"You appear to have a slight wardrobe malfunction, and I'm protecting you from the lecherous idiots that share our train."  
“你似乎有点衣着上的小问题，我在保护你免受那些和我们同乘一车的色狼们的骚扰。”

"I count you as one of those idiots as well, asshole! The hell are you talking about, 'wardrobe malfunction'?" Asuka looked down at her dress, before quickly realising Shinji had made the right, if unexpected move.  
"我把你也算作那些白痴之一了，混蛋！你到底在说什么，'服装故障'？" 明日香低头看了看自己的裙子，随即迅速意识到，尽管出乎意料，但真嗣的举动是正确的。

"You have got to be joking..."  
"你一定是在开玩笑吧..."

"See?" Shinji grinned. "For my actions in the line of duty, I deserve immunity from concussion after this is all over."  
"看吧？" 真嗣咧嘴一笑。"就凭我在任务中的表现，这一切结束后，我应该免受脑震荡之苦。

"You'll be lucky not to get my foot up your ass as soon as we get off this damn train." Asuka mumbled as she held onto Shinji's shirt. "Don't you dare move until then. I hope to god Hikari's got a spare bra I can steal..."  
"下了这该死的火车，你最好祈祷别让我一脚踹你屁股上。" 明日香咕哝着，紧紧抓着真嗣的衬衫。"在那之前你敢动一下试试。希望老天保佑，光有备用的胸罩让我偷..."

"Will that even fit?" "那能合适吗？"

"What in the hell are you trying to say Ikari!? Hikari and me are roughly the same size..."  
"你到底想说什么，碇真嗣！？我和光身材差不多..."

"Fantastic, I now know roughly the bra size of our class president." Shinji grinned as he thought of informing Toji when he survived this particular hell.  
"太棒了，我现在大概知道我们班长的胸围了。" 真嗣咧嘴一笑，想着如果能从这场特别的炼狱中活下来，一定要告诉透治。

"Why do you know my bra size!?" Asuka hissed, her face could boil water instantly. "Asshole! Pervert!" She began beating his chest angrily.  
"你怎么会知道我的胸围！？" 明日香低声怒斥，她的脸瞬间红得能烧开水。"混蛋！变态！" 她开始愤怒地捶打他的胸膛。

"Hey, who does all of the washing in our house?"  
"嘿，家里所有的衣服都是谁洗的？"

"Fair point, but that doesn't mean you have to memorise this stuff!"  
"说得好，但这并不意味着你必须记住这些！"

"To be fair, I wash all of the clothes so often, I could recite Misato and your sizes from memory easily. Let me think, I'm sure you're something like a B-cup, and your..." A firm grasp on his ear made for an abrupt punctuation.  
"说真的，我洗了那么多衣服，很容易就能从记忆中背出美里和你尺码。让我想想，我肯定你是 B 罩杯，还有你的..." 他耳朵被紧紧抓住，话音戛然而止。

"Try telling the whole damn train Shinji, see what happens." The man standing behind Asuka shifted uncomfortably. The pain increased on Shinji's ear, and only stopped after a sharp yelp of pain escaped his lips.  
"试试告诉整列火车的人，真嗣，看看会发生什么。"站在明日香身后的男人不安地挪动着。真嗣的耳朵疼痛加剧，直到他发出一声痛苦的尖叫才停止。

"I'm sorry!" He half-meant it too. Back in the day, he had been too nervous to even talk to Asuka. Being able to tease her like his was something out of a dream, and he wanted to relish every second of it. Rolling her eyes, Asuka buried her head into his chest, partly to escape their confounding situation, but partly as a way to enjoy Shinji's scent under pretense.  
"对不起！" 他这话也半真半假。回想当初，他紧张得连和明日香说话都不敢。如今能像这样逗弄她，简直是梦寐以求的事，他想要好好享受每一刻。明日香翻了个白眼，把头埋进他的胸膛，一方面是为了逃避这令人困惑的处境，另一方面也是借机享受真嗣的气息，尽管是假借名义。

"Stupid idiot..." She mumbled to herself.  
"笨蛋..." 她喃喃自语。

What felt like an entirely too-short eternity to them both later, they arrived at their stop, after which they raced to their classroom, just making it in the nick of time. After a hasty conversation with the class president, Asuka and Hikari quickly dashed for the girls locker room, returning with a satisfied smile on both girls faces. Asuka's smile quickly turned to irritation after spotting Shinji's knowing grin and sat down on her chair, her mood in a strange place between sour and bashful after the events of the morning replayed in her head. Caught up in her bubbly daydream, she didn't even notice as their usual, old and frail homeroom teacher wandered in.  
对他们两人来说，仿佛是过于短暂的永恒之后，他们到达了目的地，随后便冲向教室，刚好赶在最后一刻。与班长匆忙交谈后，明日香和光速奔向女更衣室，回来时两人脸上都带着满意的微笑。看到真嗣那副了然于心的笑容，明日香的笑容迅速转为恼怒，坐回自己的椅子上，早晨发生的事在脑海中重播，让她心情复杂，既酸涩又羞涩。沉浸在欢快的白日梦中，她甚至没注意到他们那老迈衰弱的班主任缓缓走进教室。

"Good morning class. I have an announcement. I may have mentioned to everyone last week how this class would be getting a new homeroom teacher soon, and I am pleased to announced she has arrived, albeit five minutes late for her first day." The class giggled in response, with Shinji agreeing with the crowd. Asuka, on the other hand, had a sudden sinking feeling that she couldn't quite explain.  
"同学们早上好。我有个通知。上周我可能跟大家提过，这门课很快会有新的班主任，我很高兴地宣布她已经到了，尽管她第一天就迟到了五分钟。" 班级里响起一阵轻笑，真嗣也随声附和。然而，明日香却突然感到一种难以名状的沉重感。

"Without further ado, if you would please, Miss..."  
"废话不多说，请您，小姐……"

"Katsuragi." A familiar voice echoed from the front of the class as an equally similar head of purple hair walked pridefully into their classroom. Their guardian, looking slightly tousled after what must have been plenty of near-death experiences with other vehicles, was standing at the front of the class, grinning directly at her two roommates.  
"葛城。" 一个熟悉的声音从教室前方传来，同样熟悉的紫色头发骄傲地走进了教室。他们的监护人，看起来在经历了无数次与死神擦肩而过的车辆事故后略显凌乱，站在教室前，直接对着她的两个室友咧嘴笑。

"Good morning class, I'm sorry for the delay. As mentioned before, my name is Misato Katsuragi, and starting today, I'm going to be your new homeroom teacher! I hope we can all get along and have an awesome year together!" No sooner had she stopped talking then all the boys in the class erupted into cheers. The cheers stopped quickly however, when two indignantly loud voices cut through all of the noise and screamed as loud as they could.  
"同学们早上好，很抱歉迟到了。之前提过，我叫葛城美里，从今天开始，我就是你们的新班主任了！希望我们能相处融洽，共同度过一个精彩的一年！"她话音刚落，班上的男生们就爆发出欢呼声。然而，欢呼声很快就被两声愤怒的大喊打断，那声音盖过了所有的噪音，尖锐而响亮。

"YOU COULD'VE GIVEN US A LIFT EARLIER!"  
"你本可以早点载我们一程的！"

### Chapter 2: Gods of Creation  
第二章：创世之神  

"Honey, I'm serious!" “亲爱的，我是认真的！”

"Gendo, I think you're finally starting to crack..."  
“源堂，我觉得你终于开始崩溃了……”

"Yui, I'm not losing it. I have a daughter, her name is Hitagi Senjougahara!"  
"结衣，我没有疯。我有个女儿，她叫战场原黑仪！"

"No dear, you have a son. His name is Shinji Ikari. Unless you've been hiding something from me for all these years. But thankfully I have the past experience to know that you're dreams go out of control at the touch of a hat."  
"不，亲爱的，你有个儿子。他叫碇真嗣。除非这些年你一直对我有所隐瞒。但幸好我有过去的经验，知道你的梦境一触即发就会失控。"

"...and she has a boyfriend called Koyomi Araragi, who saved her from her disease of weightlessness caught from the crabs."  
"……而且她有个男朋友叫阿良良木历，他救她摆脱了从螃蟹那里感染的失重病。"

"For the love of god..."  
"看在上帝的份上..."

The two scientists sat over the diagram readouts, mumbling to each other over cups of strong coffee. Both looked completely exhausted, and Gendo's eyes danced around the room, his lack of sleep for over seventy-two hours beginning to spark insanity in his mind, whilst his wife looked on disgruntled. She was used to her husband being a little crazy sometimes, but the lack of sleep to her was testing her patience. Plus, the potential miracle of an experiment they were waiting to test was driving her mad. Having to wait to see the unbelievable that you knew was coming was testing her normally gentle and patient personality.  
两位科学家坐在图表读数前，一边喝着浓咖啡一边喃喃自语。两人看起来都筋疲力尽，碇源堂的眼睛在房间里四处游移，连续七十多小时未眠开始在他的脑海中点燃疯狂的火花，而他的妻子则不满地看着他。她已经习惯了丈夫偶尔的疯狂，但缺乏睡眠对她来说正在考验她的耐心。此外，他们等待测试的实验潜在的奇迹也在逼疯她。不得不等待见证你明知即将到来的不可思议之事，正在考验她原本温柔耐心的性格。

"...and she had beautiful, long purple hair."  
"...而她有着美丽的长长的紫色头发。"

"Gendo! We've got only a few hours before we have to let the kids know the experiments that will change their lives forever. And we sure as hell can't trust Kyoko to do it! Get your head out of your ass and focus!"  
"源堂！我们只剩下几个小时就要告诉孩子们那些将永远改变他们生活的实验了。而且我们绝对不能指望绫波零来做这件事！别再逃避现实，集中精神！"

"...she was a bit of a bitch though. All tsundere, killed all the cute." With her blood vessels reaching a critical breaking point, Yui Ikari cracked her husband around the head with a heavy folder.  
"...她虽然有点泼辣。典型的傲娇，把可爱都扼杀了。" 随着血管濒临破裂的临界点，碇唯用一个厚重的文件夹猛击了丈夫的头。

"You're going to be the death of me one of these days..." Yui mumbled as she massaged her aching head.  
""你总有一天会把我气死的..."" 碇唯一边嘟囔着，一边揉着疼痛的头部。

---

With the shock of their new homeroom teacher finally beginning to recede, Asuka hung her head behind her chair, staring at the ceiling. She didn't think she could handle more surprises today. She wanted Shinji's delicious home-cooked bento in her stomach, but lunch was still hours away. Stomach grumbling, she turned to face Shinji, who happened to sit next to her, flashing him a look of practiced annoyance. His response was a confused expression and a shrug, which wasn't the kind of attention she had been looking for.  
随着新班主任带来的震惊逐渐消退，明日香低着头躲在椅子后面，盯着天花板。她觉得今天已经无法再承受更多的惊喜了。她渴望吃到真嗣亲手做的美味便当，但午餐时间还遥遥无期。肚子咕咕叫着，她转向坐在旁边的真嗣，露出了一副惯常的恼怒表情。他的回应却是一脸困惑和耸肩，这并不是她所期待的反应。

Tearing out a scrap of paper from her notepad, she quickly began writing a message.  
她从笔记本上撕下一张纸条，迅速开始写起信息来。

_"I'm bored!" “我好无聊！”_

Having received it, Shinji quickly read the note and glanced at her, flashing a smile that agreed with her.  
收到纸条后，真嗣迅速阅读了一遍，然后瞥了她一眼，露出了一个与她心意相通的微笑。

_"Me too. I'm not paying attention at all. You got any ideas to kill the time?"_ Asuka thought about the response for a little while, until a small grin crept into her expression.  
“我也是，根本没在听。你有什么打发时间的主意吗？”明日香思考了一会儿，直到她的脸上慢慢浮现出一丝微笑。

_"Let's play a game!" “我们来玩游戏吧！”_

_"What kind of game?" “什么类型的游戏？”_

_"20 questions, gone wild!"_ Shinji's eyes widened to impossible sizes as he read the response. It was all she could do to not laugh out loud. After she'd received the affirmative from Shinji, she began their little game.  
“20 个问题，疯狂版！” 真嗣的眼睛瞪得大到不可思议，他读着回复。她尽力忍住不笑出声。在得到真嗣的肯定后，她开始了他们的小游戏。

_"Out of all the girls in the class, who's the cutest?"  
“在班上所有女生中，谁最可爱？”_

_"That's not a fair question..."  
"那问题不公平……"_

_"Answer the damn question, stupid Shinji!"  
"回答那个该死的问题，愚蠢的真嗣！"_

_"A certain fiery fräulein I know..."_ He had the audacity to look sheepish, but his comment made her happy. At least he had noticed she was an attractive organism of the female species. Pencil in his mouth, Shinji finally came up with a question that surprised her.  
""我认识的一位热情的女士……"" 他居然厚颜无耻地露出了尴尬的表情，但他的话让她感到高兴。至少他注意到了她是个有魅力的女性生物。嘴里叼着铅笔，真嗣终于想出了一个让她惊讶的问题。

_"Is there anyone that you like?"_ Her heartbeat flared as she struggled to find an immediate answer. She wasn't mentally ready to tell him that she liked him, but one wrong move and she could hint to Shinji that it wasn't him she liked, dashing her hopes of a future relationship entirely.  
"你有喜欢的人吗？" 她的心跳加速，努力寻找一个即时的答案。她还没准备好告诉他她喜欢他，但一旦说错话，就可能暗示给真嗣她喜欢的不是他，彻底粉碎了她对未来关系的希望。

_"If you mean like as in people I can bear with most on a daily basis, I'd have to choose you I guess."_ After sneaking him the note, she hid her face away from him, afraid she'd let slip her innermost thoughts. She heard a surprised gasp of air coming from his direction, before hearing the pencil scratching on the paper again.  
"如果你是指日常生活中我能忍受最多的人，我想我得选你吧。" 递给他纸条后，她把脸藏了起来，生怕泄露内心的真实想法。她听到他那边传来惊讶的吸气声，然后又听到铅笔在纸上划过的声音。

_"You write incredibly frustrating answers, I have no idea what that means in the female language."  
"你写的答案真是让人抓狂，我完全不懂这在女性语言里是什么意思。"_

She came close to whacking him across the head with her textbook, but settled with glaring at him as though looks could cause people to spontaneously combust.  
她差点用教科书敲他的头，但最终只是狠狠地瞪着他，仿佛眼神能让人自燃。

_"Read too much into it and I'll have you for lunch instead of the damn bento!"  
“别想太多，不然我可要把你当午餐吃了，而不是那该死的便当！”_

As soon as she handed it over, she regretted writing the response. She meant it as something angry, but replaying the words in her head and it began to sound... flirty? Her fears were confirmed when Shinji covered his mouth, trying not to laugh. Whimpering in exasperation, she buried her head in her arms on her desk. The rest of the day passed by in a slow, painful, agonizing fashion.  
她一递过去就后悔写了那个回复。本意是表达愤怒，但回想起来，那些话听起来...有点挑逗？当真嗣捂住嘴，努力不笑出声时，她的担忧得到了证实。她懊恼地呜咽一声，把头埋在桌上的手臂里。剩下的时间里，日子过得缓慢、痛苦且煎熬。

"This is so disappointing."  
这真是太令人失望了。

"Gendo, focus!" "源堂，专注点！"

"But, but...!" Gendo Ikari was looking at his son, a mixture of disappointment and fear written over his face. "That's not my precious Hitagi!"  
"但是，但是...！" 碇源堂看着他的儿子，脸上交织着失望和恐惧。"那不是我珍贵的战场原！"

"...what?" Shinji mumbled, incredibly confused at his incomprehensible father's words.  
"...什么？" 真嗣喃喃自语，对他的父亲那难以理解的话语感到极度困惑。

"Hitagi! My daughter!" “黑仪！我的女儿！”

_***WHACK* *啪***_

The elder Ikari male crumpled to the ground, with Yui Ikari standing over him, a look of pure rage covering her face.  
老式的碇家男性倒在地上，碇唯站在他上方，脸上覆盖着纯粹的愤怒。

"That's enough! Sleep there for a few minutes, I can do the introduction by myself at least." Both Asuka and Shinji looked suitably horrified. Shinji's mother rarely ever displayed anger, so whenever her rage did display itself, it was terrifying.  
"够了！在那儿睡几分钟吧，至少我自己能做个介绍。" 明日香和真嗣都露出了适度的惊恐。真嗣的母亲很少表现出愤怒，所以每当她的怒火显现时，都极其可怕。

"We've brought you here today to explain to you the nature of our experiments. Neither of us have slept for over three days, so your father is going insane and I'm getting a little... irritated." Yui walked over to a nearby laptop connected to the ceiling-mounted projector, flicking everything on. The room dimmed as one of the walls parallel to the two teenagers lit-up with an image. From what they could tell, they were looking at a simple, white-walled room with nothing inside. There didn't seem to be anything interesting about the room, and Shinji looked at his mother fearfully.  
"今天带你们来这里，是为了向你们解释我们的实验性质。我们俩已经超过三天没睡觉了，所以你父亲快疯了，而我也有点...烦躁。" 绫波走到一台连接着天花板投影仪的笔记本电脑旁，打开了所有设备。房间暗了下来，与两个青少年平行的墙壁亮起了一张图像。从他们能看到的来看，这是一个空无一物的简单白色墙壁房间。这个房间似乎没有什么有趣的地方，真嗣害怕地看着他的母亲。

"...maybe you've both been in here a little too long, mother."  
"...也许你们俩在这里待得太久了，妈妈。"

A fierce look of boiling anger was his response, causing Shinji to whimper like a rabbit, cowering behind Asuka. The German girl had given him enough scary looks that he thought he was ready for anything, but even Asuka herself was shaking in fear.  
他眼中燃烧的怒火如此猛烈，让真嗣像兔子一样呜咽着，躲在明日香身后瑟瑟发抖。德国女孩给他的可怕眼神已经够多了，他以为自己已经无所畏惧，但就连明日香自己也在恐惧中颤抖。

"Admittedly, it doesn't look like much, but that room is the single, most advanced example of virtual reality engineering in the world. What you're looking at is the room in its default state. I need the both of you to go into that room, and... test its capabilities." After a flick of a switch, a small door materialized underneath the projected image.  
“诚然，它看起来并不起眼，但那房间是世界上最为先进的虚拟现实工程实例。你们现在看到的是它的默认状态。我需要你们两个进入那个房间，并……测试它的性能。”随着开关轻轻一拨，投影图像下方凭空出现了一扇小门。

"Go." At her encouragement, Asuka and Shinji walked towards the door and pushed it open. The exact same room as they had seen on the projection greeted them.  
“去吧。”在她的鼓励下，明日香和真嗣走向那扇门，推开它。映入眼帘的，正是他们在投影中看到的那个房间。

_"Stand in the middle."_ Yui's voice could now be heard over a communications system, the metallic voice reverberating around the room. As they were told, they stood in the middle of the room, looking at each other with confused faces.  
"站在中间。" 通过通讯系统，Yui 的声音现在可以被听到，金属质感的声音在房间里回荡。正如他们被告知的那样，他们站在房间中央，面面相觑，脸上带着困惑的表情。

As she was typing furiously into the computer, Gendo began to awaken, getting to his feet as held his aching head. Yui noticed the sound of her husband returning to consciousness and swiftly pointed to the projection of the room, now with the two teenagers inside.  
当她疯狂地在电脑上打字时，Gendo 开始苏醒，他站起身来，手扶着疼痛的头。Yui 注意到丈夫恢复意识的声音，迅速指向房间的投影，现在里面有两个青少年。

"It's your cue." "轮到你了。"

Gendo nodded as he looked towards the projection. Inside the now sealed room, his face appeared before the two children as a small, floating window.  
源堂点头，目光转向投影。在如今已被封闭的房间内，他的脸出现在两个孩子面前，化作一个小小的悬浮窗口。

_"You are both now inside a virtual reality. However, your bodies are still physical, meaning you will be able to touch anything around you as though it existed in real life."  
“你们现在身处虚拟现实之中。不过，你们的身体仍然是实体的，这意味着你们能够像周围的一切真实存在一样去触摸它们。”_

"We can... touch virtual objects? That's breaking a few laws of physics, isn't it?" Asuka said in disbelief towards the floating image of Shinji's father. The face smiled mischievously back at her.  
“我们可以……触摸虚拟物体？这岂不是打破了物理定律吗？”明日香对着悬浮的碇司令影像表示怀疑。那张脸则带着一丝狡黠的微笑回望着她。

_"Would you like an example? Shinji, imagine a small animal, like a cat on the floor in front of you."  
"想要个例子吗？真嗣，想象一下你面前地板上有只小动物，比如一只猫。"_

With an exasperated expression directed towards Asuka, Shinji began to look at the floor, imagining a jet-black cat. Within seconds, a physical cat appeared before them, looking up at them, slightly confused as to why it was there.  
带着对明日香无奈的表情，真嗣开始注视地板，想象着一只乌黑的猫。几秒钟内，一只实体的猫出现在他们面前，抬头看着他们，略显困惑为何自己会在这里。

"You have got to be joking...!" Asuka slowly breathed as she watched the cat walk towards her, and physically rub its head on her leg. "How...!? I can feel it!"  
"你一定是在开玩笑吧...！" 明日香缓缓呼吸着，看着那只猫向她走来，用头蹭着她的腿。"怎么可能...！我能感觉到它！"

_"It's a confirmed success!"_ An incredibly overexcited sounding Yui Ikari shrieked from the communications channel. _"Stability at eighty-seven percent, no problems with the children's physical composition. Phase two, go!"_ She yelled the final words at Gendo, who clapped his hands with excitement.  
"确认成功了！" 通讯频道中传来极为兴奋的绫波唯的声音。"稳定性达到百分之八十七，孩子们的身体结构没有问题。第二阶段，开始！" 她对着碇源堂大喊，碇源堂兴奋地拍手。

_"Next, Asuka, we need you to imagine an environment. Anything will do, but try not to overcomplicate it. Somewhere you would be familiar with would be ideal."  
"接下来，明日香，我们需要你想象一个环境。任何地方都可以，但尽量不要过于复杂。选择一个你熟悉的地方会更好。"_

Her look of shock widened as Asuka looked back at Shinji, the black cat now in her arms as it purred contentedly. She closed her eyes, and a few seconds later, the classroom that they had been studying in only hours beforehand materialized around them. The detail was immaculate, and apart from the lack of other students, everything was a perfect replication of the room at their school.  
明日香看着怀中那只黑色猫咪，它正满足地咕噜咕噜叫着，她的震惊表情更加明显。她闭上眼睛，几秒钟后，他们几小时前还在学习的教室在他们周围实体化了。细节完美无缺，除了缺少其他学生外，一切都完美复制了学校的那个房间。

_"Phase Two, success! Anomalies holding steady at five percent, possibly due to hosts imagination processes. Phase three!"_ Yui was pounding the keyboard so fast, she was beginning to worry about her fingers breaking from the pressure.  
"第二阶段，成功！异常稳定在百分之五，可能是由于宿主的想象过程所致。第三阶段！" 结衣敲击键盘的速度如此之快，她开始担心自己的手指会因压力而断裂。

_"This time, Shinji, we need you to imagine a location from a long time ago, something you won't remember perfectly."_ His father directed him, and Shinji nodded, beginning to concentrate on a forest that his family had once taken him to when he was six-years old.  
"这次，真嗣，我们需要你想象一个很久以前的地点，一些你不会记得很清楚的东西。" 他的父亲指导他，真嗣点头，开始集中精神回想一个他六岁时家人带他去过的森林。

Slowly this time, the forest in his mind began to appear around him. But in certain areas, there were static patches.  
这次慢慢地，他脑海中的森林开始在他周围显现。但在某些区域，出现了静态斑块。

_"Success! Anomalies at sixty percent, host's health remains stable!"  
"成功！异常率 60%，宿主健康状况保持稳定！"_

_"I remember this forest."_ His father looked around the room through his window. Yui turned to him and pointed at the entrance to the room.  
"我记得这片森林。" 他的父亲透过窗户环视房间。Yui 转向他，指向房间的入口。

"Phase four, get in there!" Gendo nodded and hurried to the door, entering and standing next to the two utterly confused children. Closing his eyes, he focused on the same memory that Shinji had summoned.  
"第四阶段，进去吧！" Gendo 点头，急忙走向门口，进入房间并站在两个完全困惑的孩子旁边。他闭上眼睛，专注于与 Shinji 召唤的相同的记忆。

The static patches around them from Shinji's memories began to fuzz and stabilize into the remaining sections of forest that had been missing before. Before long, the complete forest surrounding the three open-mouthed people.  
来自真嗣记忆中的静态片段开始模糊并稳定下来，逐渐填补了之前缺失的森林部分。不久，一片完整的森林环绕在三位目瞪口呆的人周围。

_"Memory Merge, success!"_ Yui was beside herself as she came close to a mental breakdown from excitement. _"Phase four is a success!"_  
“记忆融合，成功！”由依激动得几乎要精神崩溃。“第四阶段成功了！”

Gendo nodded, grinning from ear-to-ear, before turning around and looking at the electrified Shinji and Asuka. Pointing towards the cat, his grin seemed to grow even wider.  
源堂点点头，笑得合不拢嘴，然后转身看向被电击的真嗣和明日香。他指向那只猫，笑容似乎更加灿烂了。

"Take it outside of the room."  
“把它带出房间。”

For everything that had happened so far, the next thing that would await them had seemed to shock them a hundred times more. But when Asuka nervously opened the door to the unbelievable room, and stepped outside holding the imagined cat, which didn't disappear as she exited and shut the door behind her, the realization of the experiments that had happened today would change everything as they knew it suddenly began to dawn on them.  
迄今为止发生的种种，接下来等待他们的似乎是百倍于前的震惊。然而，当明日香紧张地推开那不可思议房间的门，怀抱着想象中的猫踏出房门，那猫并未随她出门并关上门而消失时，今日实验的真相开始在他们心中悄然浮现，彻底颠覆了他们所知的一切。

They had created life, from the imagination of a teenage boy, that persisted and survived from outside its virtual incubator. The cat meowed happily at Asuka, who's eyes were as wide as dinner plates.  
他们从一位少年脑海中的想象里创造了生命，这生命顽强地存活于虚拟孵化器之外。那只猫对着明日香欢快地喵喵叫，她的眼睛瞪得像餐盘一样大。

As of right now, Asuka Langley Soryu and the Ikari family were essentially gods of creation.  
从现在起，明日香·兰格雷·索耶和碇家实质上成为了创造之神。

**_They were gods. 他们是神。_**

### Chapter 3: In Holy Matrimony  
第三章：神圣婚姻  

Asuka was bouncing her leg up and down under her desk as she leaned her face on her hand, trying to look bored. Together with Shinji, they had gone to school the next day after they had become literal gods. So trying to keep a disinterested look was proving to be difficult, as she thought of the million different ways this power could be used.  
明日香一边用手撑着脸，试图装出一副无聊的样子，一边在桌子底下不停地抖腿。她和真嗣在成为名副其实的神之后，第二天就去了学校。现在，她正努力保持一副漠不关心的表情，但脑海中却在思考着这种力量可以用来做无数种事情，这让她很难装得下去。

As a precaution, Shinji's parents had told them under no circumstances were they to tell anyone else about this ability. They had been clever enough to understand that nations from across the world would easily abuse this power, so keeping their mouth shut was of the utmost priority.  
为了以防万一，真嗣的父母告诫他们，无论如何都不能向任何人透露这种能力。他们足够聪明，明白世界各地的国家很容易滥用这种力量，因此守口如瓶是最重要的。

She glanced quickly at the bracelet on her left wrist. It's design looked almost futuristic, a deep crimson color with splashes of red decorated its design. Shinji wore an identical bracelet, although his was a mix of white and blue, complimented with the odd splash of black. These bracelets were designed to give them immediate access to their powers, without having to go back to the room. She wasn't quite sure how it worked, but it was apparently linked to the room in some way, enabling them to summon objects, or change their environment around them at will. And the most frustrating thing about the bracelets was that neither Gendo nor Yui had said a damn thing about how to activate them.  
她迅速瞥了一眼左手腕上的手镯。其设计看起来颇具未来感，深红色为主，点缀着红色斑点。真嗣佩戴着同样款式的手镯，不过他的以白色和蓝色为主，间或夹杂着黑色斑点。这些手镯旨在让他们无需返回房间就能立即使用自己的力量。她不太确定其工作原理，但显然与房间有某种联系，使他们能够随心所欲地召唤物品或改变周围环境。而关于手镯最令人沮丧的一点是，源堂和唯从未透露过如何激活它们。

As Asuka cursed the two mad scientists, the door to the class slid open, revealing Misato looking cheerful.  
当明日香咒骂着那两位疯狂科学家时，教室的门滑开了，露出满脸笑容的美里。

"Good morning, my fellow nutcases. I have some good news for most of you and some bad news for two of you in particular."  
“早上好，我的各位疯子们。我有一些好消息要告诉你们大多数人，也有一些坏消息特别针对你们中的两位。”

"This'll be what she was so excited about this morning." Asuka thought as she recalled their guardian giggling like a drunk schoolgirl whilst they had all been eating breakfast together this morning. It had been in equal parts curious and terrifying. Try as they might, neither she nor Shinji could extract any useful information out of her.  
“这应该就是她今早那么兴奋的原因了。”明日香回忆起今早大家一起吃早餐时，他们的监护人像喝醉的女学生一样咯咯笑个不停。这既让人好奇又感到恐怖。无论她和真嗣怎么努力，都无法从她那里套出任何有用信息。

"I have the pleasure of introducing a new transfer student to everyone today. Please treat her kindly everyone! Miss Ayanami, you may enter."  
“今天我有幸向大家介绍一位新转来的学生。请大家好好待她！绫波同学，你可以进来了。”

At her words, a young girl with eye-catching light-blue hair walked into the classroom. As she turned to face the class, Asuka noticed her eyes were a bright, slightly-unnerving crimson. But more importantly, she noticed that the transfer student bore a startling resemblance to Shinji's mother. And on top of that, she was incredibly cute.  
随着她的话音落下，一位拥有引人注目的淡蓝色头发的少女走进了教室。当她转身面对全班时，明日香注意到她的眼睛是明亮而略显不安的猩红色。但更重要的是，她注意到这位转学生与真嗣的母亲惊人地相似。而且，她还非常可爱。

"I swear to god, if I catch Shinji staring at her, I'm going to..." Asuka muttered as she turned around to look at Shinji. She wasn't expecting his expression to be laced with shock and horror in equal measure. As she wondered what had him so scared, the transfer student began to speak.  
"我发誓，如果我抓到真嗣盯着她看，我就……" 明日香喃喃自语着转过身去看真嗣。她没想到他的表情会如此震惊和恐惧交织。正当她疑惑是什么让他如此害怕时，转学生开始说话了。

"My name is Rei Ayanami, its a pleasure to meet you." She did a small bow, and as she looked up again, Asuka noticed her flash a smile in Shinji's direction. Whipping her head back, she saw that Shinji's expression had grown a hundred times more petrified looking.  
"我叫绫波零，很高兴见到你们。" 她微微鞠了一躬，抬起头时，明日香注意到她向真嗣的方向露出了一个微笑。明日香猛地转过头，看到真嗣的表情变得更加惊恐。

"And be careful boys, she's technically already spoken for!" Misato piped up from her chair near the window. All of the boys looked at her, both horrified and confused at the same time. Winking at Rei, she nodded towards her.  
"还有，男孩们小心点，她理论上已经有主了！" 美里从窗边的椅子上插话道。所有的男生都看向她，既惊恐又困惑。美里对绫波眨了眨眼，向她点头示意。

"It's time to reveal the biggest news of all." It sounded like Misato was having a hard time containing her excitement. Rei nodded, suddenly looking bashful and shy, began to walk towards the centre of the class, specifically to Shinji's chair. After having reached her destination, she smiled at him.  
"是时候揭晓最大的新闻了。" 美里听起来难以抑制她的兴奋。绫波点点头，突然显得害羞起来，开始走向教室中央，特别是向真嗣的椅子走去。到达目的地后，她对他微笑。

"It is good to see you after all this time, Shinji. Here, this is for you." She placed a small box in front of him, a very familiar-looking box.  
"这么久没见，真嗣，很高兴见到你。这个，是给你的。" 她把一个小盒子放在他面前，一个看起来非常眼熟的盒子。

"What on god's green earth is in that box Shinji." Asuka whispered, dreading the answer she knew was most likely coming. Shinji stared at the box, paralyzed in fear. This couldn't be happening. He had thought this whole thing had been forgotten about years ago.  
"那盒子里到底是什么鬼东西，真嗣。" 明日香低声说，害怕即将听到的答案。真嗣盯着盒子，恐惧得动弹不得。这不可能是真的。他以为这一切早在几年前就被遗忘了。

He picked up the box with trembling hands. The whole class waited on baited breath, the atmosphere was electric, to an almost lethal degree. He gently prised open the box, confirming his worst fears. Sitting snugly inside the box were two, sparkling engagement rings.  
他用颤抖的双手拿起盒子。全班屏息以待，气氛紧张到几乎致命的程度。他小心翼翼地打开盒子，证实了自己最深的恐惧。盒子里稳稳地放着两枚闪闪发光的订婚戒指。

The whole class erupted into pandemonium.  
全班顿时陷入一片混乱。

"...what?" Asuka looked mental, with one eye stretched far wider than it should have been able to, a demonic grin danced across her face. "WHAT? WHAAAT!?"  
“...什么？” 明日香看起来精神错乱，一只眼睛睁得比正常能张开的还要大，脸上跳跃着恶魔般的笑容。“什么？什么！？”

"SHINJI, YOU BASTARD!" Toji Suzuhara, his supposed best friend and pillar of support during most of their hard times together, looked about ready to punch him square in the face.  
"真嗣，你这个混蛋！" 他的所谓最好的朋友，也是大多数艰难时刻的支柱，铃原东治看起来几乎要一拳打在他脸上。

"THE HELL IS ALL THIS ABOUT!? You've already chummy with the hottest girl in the school, where the fuck are engagement rings coming from!? With this new chick!?"  
"这他妈的都是怎么回事！？你已经和学校里最火的女孩打得火热了，哪来的订婚戒指！？还是和这个新来的！？"

"Suzuhara, language!" "铃原，注意言辞！"

"Shove it Class Prez! This is a national emergency!" His retort ignited a blazing fire under the temper of their class president, Hikari Horaki. Her face matched Asuka's current expression in terms of pure terror, immediately rushing to Toji and grasping his ear with the strength of an enraged lion.  
"闭嘴，班长！这是全国性的紧急情况！" 他的反驳如同点燃了导火索，激起了班长光里堇的怒火。她的脸色与明日香此刻的表情一样，充满了纯粹的恐惧，立刻冲向东治，用狮子般的力道抓住了他的耳朵。

"Would you like to repeat that, Suzuhara?"  
"你愿意再说一遍吗，铃原？"

Meanwhile, Shinji had about five seconds to live, as his situation changed for the worse when Rei suddenly put his arms around him. A pure explosion of rage erupted from Asuka, as her table went flying across the room.  
与此同时，真嗣的生命只剩下大约五秒钟，因为情况急转直下，零突然抱住了他。明日香爆发出纯粹的愤怒，她的桌子飞过整个房间。

"WHAT ARE YOU DONIG TO HIM!?" She was barely stopping herself from launching at the blue-haired girl, who looked back at her, confused by Asuka's rage.  
“你在对他做什么！？”她几乎控制不住自己冲向那个蓝发女孩，而对方回望着她，对明日香突如其来的愤怒感到困惑。

"I'm simply hugging him. It's been at least six years since I last saw my childhood friend, and it's time for our promise to be fulfilled."  
我只是紧紧拥抱他。自从上次见到儿时好友，至少已有六年光阴，是时候兑现我们的承诺了。

"What. Fucking. Promise?" Asuka aimed the icy question at both Shinji and Rei. "I'm pretty sure I've just crapped myself..." Shinji moaned as the two girls continued to glare at each other.  
“什么。该死的。承诺？”明日香冷冷地向真嗣和绫波发问。“我敢肯定我刚刚吓得尿裤子了……”真嗣呻吟着，两个女孩依旧互相瞪视。

"IKARI, SORYU, LANGUAGE!" Hikari roared from behind him, still wrestling with Toji.  
“伊卡里，索琉，语言！”光从他身后咆哮道，仍在与托吉扭打。

"His father promised my father that we would be engaged to marry when we both came to the right age. It has been a long time coming, but I have been waiting for this day to finally reunite with Shinji, for a long time." Rei glanced down at the terrified boy, a small blush creeping onto her face.  
“他的父亲曾向我父亲承诺，当我们都到了适婚年龄时，我们将订婚结婚。这一天已经等了很久，但我一直在等待与真嗣重逢的这一天，已经很久了。” 绫波瞥了一眼惊恐的男孩，脸上泛起一丝淡淡的红晕。

"But... why...?" Asuka's rage could be heard between every whispered syllable. "Why him?"  
“但是...为什么...？” 明日香的声音中夹杂着愤怒，每个字都几乎在颤抖。“为什么是他？”

A moment's silence passed, as Rei thought about her response. She looked up, a firm determination present in her eyes.  
一阵沉默过后，绫波思考着如何回应。她抬起头，眼中闪烁着坚定的决心。

"Without Shinji Ikari, I would not be alive today."  
没有碇真嗣，我今天就不会活着。

The silence returned, echoing around the classroom. Rei stood up, letting Shinji go.  
沉默再次降临，回荡在教室中。丽站起身，放开了真嗣。

"I was saved from a debilitating illness, not by medicine, nor by the magic of modern day science, but through the kindness that Shinji brought to me, everyday I sat in a lonely medical ward."  
"我被一种顽疾所困，不是药物，也不是现代科学的魔法救了我，而是每天坐在孤独的病房里，真嗣带给我的善意。"

"For most of my life, I had been alone. I hadn't had any real friends, nor was my father around often, due to his job. My mother passed away at a young age, and I was too shy to make any friends of my own. Then, due to unfortunate circumstances, I found myself waking up in a medical ward at NERV, where my father worked. I was told that it would take a miracle to save me from my illness."  
"我大半生都是孤独一人。我没有真正的朋友，父亲也因为工作不常在家。母亲在我年幼时便去世了，而我太害羞，无法结交朋友。后来，由于不幸的境遇，我发现自己醒来时身处 NERV 的医疗病房，那里是我父亲工作的地方。我被告知，要从我的病中得救，需要一个奇迹。"

"It was then I first met Shinji. His parents both worked at NERV, and his father, who is my father's cousin, had brought him to work one day, to show him some of the experiments that were going on. By mistake, Shinji got lost and ended up in my room. And instead of leaving, he stayed with me and chatted with me. We stayed there for hours until his parents eventually discovered him."  
那时我第一次遇见了真嗣。他的父母都在 NERV 工作，而他父亲，也就是我父亲的表弟，某天带他来参观正在进行的一些实验。不巧的是，真嗣迷路了，误打误撞进了我的房间。他没有选择离开，而是留下来和我聊天。我们就这样待了好几个小时，直到他的父母终于找到了他。

"I begged him to stay, and through various circumstances, Shinji was allowed to visit me. Almost everyday he would come to my room, sometimes bringing games to play. And eventually, over time, my illness began to dissipate. Because of those happy days I spent with Shinji, he gave to me a miracle. The only thing I can give to him in return is my love, and everlasting matrimony."  
我恳求他留下，在种种机缘下，真嗣得以来探望我。几乎每天他都会来到我的房间，有时还会带上游戏一起玩。渐渐地，随着时间的推移，我的病情开始好转。因为与真嗣共度的那些快乐时光，他为我带来了奇迹。我能回报给他的，唯有我的爱，以及永恒的婚姻。

The rest of the day passed agonizingly slowly, with Rei and Asuka butting heads with each other at every opportunity. The majority of their teachers were terrified of the spectacle, not to mention Shinji felt a constant fear of dying from a terror-induced heart attack.  
这一天剩下的时间过得异常缓慢，丽和明日香一有机会就互相较劲。大多数老师都对这一幕感到恐惧，更别提真嗣一直担心自己会因惊吓过度而心脏病发作。

The last bell ringing was heavenly music to his ears. He just wanted to go home, eat and sleep the nightmare of the day away. Catching sight of Misato walking towards him, a slightly apologetic expression on her face, he realized that his troubles were far from over.  
最后一声铃响对他而言宛如天籁。他只想回家，吃顿饭，然后睡一觉，把这糟糕的一天抛诸脑后。瞥见美里朝他走来，脸上带着些许歉意的表情，他意识到自己的麻烦远未结束。

"Shinji... How's it going?" She tried to sound as lighthearted as possible, but even she knew how tough today had been on him.  
"真嗣... 还好吗？" 她尽量让自己的语气听起来轻松愉快，但就连她自己也知道今天对他来说有多艰难。

"I want to find my father and strangle him." He said, exasperated. "He told me he had 'smoothed things over' with this promise."  
"我想找到我父亲然后掐死他。" 他气愤地说，"他告诉我他已经‘把事情摆平了’，还用这个承诺来搪塞我。"

"Do you not like Rei?" Misato looked at him quizzically. He shook his head.  
"你不喜欢绫波吗？" 美里疑惑地看着他。他摇了摇头。

"It's not that. It just came out of nowhere, that's all. All these years, I wasn't too worried about it, because I thought Rei saw me as a friend, and nothing else. But then she transfer into my class, declares her love and dedication and I feel like somebody's thrown a metaphorical brick in my face. It's all too sudden, I don't know what's going on..."  
“不是那样的。只是它突然就出现了，仅此而已。这么多年，我并不太担心，因为我以为丽把我当朋友，仅此而已。但后来她转到了我们班，宣布她的爱意和奉献，我感觉像是有人朝我脸上扔了一块隐喻的砖头。这一切都太突然了，我不知道发生了什么...”

Misato nodded sympathetically, ruffling his hair. "I understand kiddo. Love's never an easy battle to fight, especially when you've got a pretty thing like Asuka hanging around day and night. But things will get better."  
美里同情地点点头，揉乱了他的头发。“我理解你，孩子。爱情从来都不是一场容易的战斗，尤其是当你身边有个像明日香这样漂亮的人日夜相伴时。但情况会好转的。”

Her smile quickly turned into a look of panic as she realized something.  
她的微笑迅速变成了惊慌的表情，因为她意识到了什么。

"Actually, wait, scratch that, things are going to get a whole lot worse!" Looking up at her, his own face now in a panic, he trembled at the thought of more bad news involving the girls.  
“实际上，等等，别提了，事情会变得更糟！”他抬头看着她，自己的脸上也露出了惊慌，一想到还会有关于女孩们的坏消息，他就颤抖不已。

"I totally forgot to mention that Rei's moving in with us!"  
“我完全忘了提，丽要搬来和我们一起住了！”

After that, he was instructed to explain the news to Asuka. Misato offered him a stab/bulletproof vest she had for 'reasons'. Politely refusing, he made his way to where she thought she might be. Discovering her in their homeroom classroom, sitting on his desk, swinging her legs as she looked outside, she turned to face him as he walked in. Noticing his grim expression, her own face dropped into a dark scowl.  
之后，他被指示向明日香解释新闻内容。美里递给他一件因某种原因备有的防刺/防弹背心，他礼貌地拒绝了，然后前往她可能所在的地方。在他们的教室里找到她，她正坐在他的桌子上，晃着双腿望向窗外，听到他进来，她转过身来。注意到他阴沉的表情，她的脸也沉了下来，露出了阴郁的怒容。

"Oh god... what now?" "天哪... 又怎么了？"

After he quickly explained, he could have sworn the classroom had literally exploded with her fury.  
在他迅速解释之后，他几乎可以发誓教室里她的愤怒简直像爆炸了一样。

---

They had entered the park that was on the way home. Asuka stomped ahead of him, fuming. She was that angry that he could literally feel the burning aura radiating from her. He hadn't felt this scared of her since when they were kids, back when he had been much more shy.  
他们走进了回家路上的那个公园。明日香怒气冲冲地在他前面跺着脚走，她的愤怒如此强烈，以至于他都能感受到从她身上散发出的炽热气场。自从他们还是孩子，那时他更加害羞以来，他从未如此害怕过她。

"Asuka..." He gently tried to talk to her, but his response was a dangerous sounding growl. His shoulders slumped as he mumbled towards her back.  
"明日香..." 他轻声试图与她交谈，却只得到一声危险的低吼。他垂下肩膀，对着她的背影喃喃自语。

"I'm sorry..." "对不起..."

Time froze. Along with Asuka's footsteps, and the world around them seemed to quieten. It sounded like a normal thing to say, but Asuka's response was a small sob. It was the most heartbreaking sound he could have heard from her. The invincible Asuka, the girl who never backed down. The girl that every single male at their school was attracted to, yet equally terrified of, was quietly sobbing in front of him.  
时间仿佛凝固了。随着明日香的脚步，周围的世界似乎也安静下来。这句话听起来很平常，但明日香的回应却是一声轻微的啜泣。这是他最不愿从她口中听到的声音。那个无所不能的明日香，那个从不退缩的女孩。学校里每一个男生都为之倾倒，却又同样畏惧的女孩，正默默地在他面前啜泣。

"Wha- Asuka!?" He rushed up to her side, and caught a glimpse of her face. Crystal tears swept down her face as she stood there, trying to no avail to rub her eyes, attempting to stem the flow.  
"什- 明日香！？" 他急忙冲到她身边，瞥见了她的脸。晶莹的泪水顺着她的脸颊滑落，她站在那里，徒劳地试图揉搓眼睛，试图止住泪水的流淌。

"Shinji... stop, don't... don't look at me..."  
"真嗣... 停下，不要... 别看着我..."

"Why are you crying Asuka? I'm sorry! If its something I said, I'm sorry!" He hadn't apologized to her like this since they were kids. Back then, she had yelled at him for apologizing all the time, threatening to punch him in the face if he kept on at it. He tried to curb his use of apologies since then, but he couldn't help it. Not when his best friend in the world, the girl who had stood by him through all hell, was crying his eyes out in front of him.  
“为什么你在哭，明日香？对不起！如果是因为我说了什么，我道歉！” 自从他们还是孩子以来，他就没有这样向她道过歉。那时，她曾因为他总是道歉而对他大吼大叫，威胁说如果他再这样下去就要揍他一顿。从那以后，他试图克制自己的道歉，但此刻他无法控制。毕竟，眼前这位世界上最好的朋友，那个无论多么艰难都一直陪伴在他身边的女孩，正泪流满面地站在他面前。

"Asuka..." “明日香……”

"She's... she's going to take you away from me!" She was talking about what had happened with Rei. "I've known you since god knows when, yet she swoops in out of nowhere, flashes her rings as though she's showing the world your shackles and... and... GRRAAHHH!" Screams echoed around the park as Asuka yelled towards the heavens, as though she was cursing the gods themselves.  
“她……她要把你从我身边夺走！” 她指的是与绫波发生的事情。“天知道我认识你多久了，她却突然出现，炫耀她的戒指，仿佛在向全世界展示你的枷锁……然后……然后……啊啊啊啊！” 明日香对着天空大喊，仿佛在诅咒众神，公园里回荡着她的尖叫声。

"No!" After breathing heavily for a few moments, she clenched her fists and whirled to face Shinji head-on. Her eyelashes sparkled with moisture as she glared at him. Her gaze was so fierce, he took a step back, cowering slightly.  
“不！”她喘息片刻后，紧握双拳，猛地转身直面真嗣。她的睫毛因湿润而闪烁，目光如炬地瞪着他。那眼神如此凌厉，他不由得后退一步，略显畏缩。

"I'm... sorry" His voice trembled. Realizing that she was probably frightening him, she rolled her eyes and walked over to him.  
"我... 对不起" 他的声音颤抖着。意识到自己可能吓到他了，她翻了个白眼，走过去靠近他。

"I'm not letting her do as she pleases." Asuka looked away, embarrassed as she mumbled. "But with this, I hope you finally understand how I feel. I was hoping for a more romantic confession, but these things are never easy when you're involved."  
"我不会让她随心所欲的。" 明日香别开视线，尴尬地低声说，"但通过这个，我希望你终于能理解我的感受。我本期待一个更浪漫的告白，但只要有你在，这些事从来都不简单。"

It was his turn to feel embarrassed. Looking at his shoes, he suddenly felt an unexplained sense of guilt.  
轮到他感到尴尬了。盯着鞋子的他，突然涌上一股莫名的愧疚感。

"I'm sorry..." "对不起..."

"Argh..." Asuka rolled her eyes again. "If you apologize to me one more time, I'm going to kiss you. And for every time you do it afterwards, I'm going to kiss you again. I don't care if we're in public, at school, or whatever, but I am sick of you saying sorry every five minutes. If this is the only way to shut up your incessant apologies, save using a ball gag, dammit I'll do it!" Asuka's beautiful, cerulean eyes dared him to argue. He was swept away by his pounding heart, and before his brain had any sort of chance to recover, his mouth began moving on its own.  
"啊..." 明日香又翻了个白眼。"如果你再向我道歉一次，我就会吻你。而且每次你这么做之后，我都会再吻你一次。我不在乎我们是在公共场合、在学校还是其他什么地方，但我已经受够了你每隔五分钟就说一次对不起。如果这是唯一能让你停止无休止道歉的方法，除了用口球，该死的我会这么做！" 明日香那双美丽的蔚蓝色眼睛挑衅地看着他。他的心跳如鼓，还没等大脑反应过来，嘴巴已经不由自主地动了起来。

"I'm... sorry?" Meant more as a question to her confounding statement than anything else, he clapped his hand over his mouth. But the damage had already been done.  
"我... 对不起？" 这话更多是对她那令人费解的声明的疑问，而不是别的什么，他赶紧用手捂住嘴。但伤害已经造成了。

Asuka's eyes widened in shock. But it was quickly replaced by a mischievous grin.  
明日香的双眼因震惊而睁大，但很快就被一个调皮的笑容所取代。

"That... was on purpose, wasn't it?"  
“那……是故意的，对吧？”

All he could do was open and close his mouth, gaping like a fish. He felt like his doom was imminent. To whatever gods would listen to his prayer, he wished that he would survive to at least be able to eat some katsu curry, one last time.  
他只能张嘴闭嘴，像条鱼一样呆呆地瞪着。他感觉自己的末日即将来临。向任何愿意聆听他祈祷的神明，他祈愿至少能活到再吃一次炸猪排咖喱饭，哪怕就这一次。

Asuka began to close in slowly, standing on her tiptoes, her grin getting wider and wider as the tip of her nose brushed against the tip of his own. Her arms wrapped around his neck as her face flared with a crimson blush. A fiery determination exploded in her eyes, in which Shinji was now throughly lost in. "Just this once... I'll let it slide." She whispered, her eyes never once leaving his own. One of her hands began to ruffle with his hair as she continued to whisper.  
明日香开始缓缓逼近，踮起脚尖，随着她的鼻尖轻触他的，她的笑容愈发灿烂。她的双臂环抱住他的脖颈，脸上泛起绯红。眼中燃起炽热的决心，此刻的 Shinji 完全迷失其中。“就这一次...我放过你。”她低语，目光始终未曾离开他的双眼。她的一只手开始拨弄他的头发，继续轻声细语。

"Ich liebe dich... dumm Shinji." And with that, her gentle lips pressed against his own, knocking out all of his senses, save for the touch of her lips and the sense of utter euphoria as they stood in the streetlit park, embracing each other to the sound of the chirping cicadas.  
"我爱你...傻真嗣。" 随着这句话，她温柔的唇瓣贴上了他的，剥夺了他所有的感官，只留下唇间的触感和站在街灯下公园里相拥时的极度喜悦，周围是蝉鸣的伴奏。
