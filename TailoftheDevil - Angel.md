### Chapter 1: I Live With Two Beautiful Angels!  
第一章：我与两位美丽天使同住！  

_Another name for this story could be: **The Asuka Langley Soryu Raising Project**. But I have a fetish for one-word story titles, so that didn't happen xD This story is slightly based on, yes you guessed it, **The Shinji Ikari Raising Project**! The manga, although the video game will have its references scattered around the story, here and there. Shinji starts out a lot more upbeat than he would normally be, but there is a reason for that, so bear with me!  
这个故事的另一个名字可能是：《惣流·明日香·兰格雷养成计划》。但我对单字标题情有独钟，所以没有采用那个名字 xD 这个故事在一定程度上是基于——没错，你猜对了——《碇真嗣养成计划》！虽然是以漫画为基础，但游戏中也会散落一些相关参考。真嗣一开始比平时要开朗得多，但这背后是有原因的，请耐心听我道来！_

The gentle rays of the morning sun peeked through the small gap in the curtain, reflecting the slowly falling dust floating lazily to the floor. The light managed to reach the face of a teenage boy who was fast asleep. A peaceful expression was etched on his face as he continued to enjoy a pleasant dream.  
清晨的阳光温柔地透过窗帘的缝隙，映照着缓缓飘落的尘埃，慵懒地落向地面。光线恰好照在了一个熟睡的少年脸上。他面带安详的表情，继续沉浸在美好的梦境中。

Mere inches away from him, a girl was breathing heavily, a furious, bright red blush on her face. She had light brown hair that she normally kept tied in twintails, but having woken up not that long ago, it lay tousled as she leaned over the sleeping boy, wrestling with her emotions. Her soft blue eyes looked over his face as loose strands of her hair fell over his nose and cheek.  
离他仅几英寸远的地方，一个女孩正急促地呼吸着，脸上泛起一片鲜艳的绯红。她有着浅棕色的头发，平时总是扎成双马尾，但因为刚醒来不久，头发凌乱地垂在熟睡的男孩上方，内心挣扎不已。她柔软的蓝眼睛凝视着他的脸庞，几缕发丝轻轻落在他的鼻尖和脸颊上。

She was debating whether or not to wake him normally, as was her intention when she first walked into this room, or to wake him with a raunchy morning kiss. Compounding the problem was the fact that she had only recently realised, within the last week or so, that she was madly in love with this boy. The soul with the name Shinji Ikari had been her childhood friend since forever, but her feelings had been evolving, growing and growing to the point where she could no longer deny that the spell had been cast.  
她在犹豫是像最初走进这房间时的打算那样正常叫醒他，还是用一个挑逗的早安吻来唤醒他。问题更加复杂的是，她最近才意识到，大约就在上周左右，她已经疯狂地爱上了这个男孩。名为碇真嗣的灵魂自幼便是她的青梅竹马，但她的感情一直在变化，不断增长，直到她再也无法否认那个魔咒已经降临。

She leaned in closer, close enough that she could feel his gentle breathing tickling the tip of her nose. Her mind was pretty much made up. Edging closer and closer to the prize, she began to close her eyes as she readied herself. This was going to be her first kiss.  
她更靠近了些，近到能感受到他轻柔的呼吸拂过她鼻尖。她的心意已决。她一步步接近目标，准备就绪时开始闭上眼睛。这将是一个初吻。

Nanometres away from Shinji's lips, she was seconds away from success when a grouchy voice echoed from the other room.  
距离碇真嗣的唇仅剩纳米之遥，她即将成功之际，另一间房里传来了一个不悦的声音。

"Asuka! How long does it take to wake a teenage boy? You're both gonna be late for school!"  
"明日香！叫醒一个青春期男孩要多久？你们上学都要迟到了！"

Their guardian, Misato Katsuragi, could be heard swigging a morning beer as she busied herself getting ready. Asuka could hear footsteps moving closer to the door, causing her to panic.  
他们的监护人，葛城美里，一边忙着准备，一边可以听到她在喝早上的啤酒。明日香听到脚步声越来越靠近门，这让她感到慌张。

"Just give me a second Misato!" Sighing with regret, she began to shake her unrequited love's shoulder until groaning could be heard.  
"再给我一秒钟，美里！"" 她叹了口气，带着遗憾开始摇晃她单相思的爱人的肩膀，直到听到呻吟声。

"Just another couple minutes, please..."  
“再等几分钟就好……”

"No can do Baka. We gotta get breakfast going. Hell, even Misato's awake before you today." Standing up, she made for the door. One of Shinji's eyelids cracked open, catching a glimpse of Asuka wearing a simple yellow vest top and short shorts that left very little to the imagination. As she walked out of his room, he allowed himself a small grin. He had been awake the whole time since Asuka first entered the room, keeping it secret that he was already conscious. He was aware that Asuka had been doing strange things like this for a while, but he wasn't yet quite sure how to deal with it. The girl baffled his mind. Was she in heat? He was sure if he mentioned the idea, he'd meet the receiving end of some sharp object and be a lot worse off for it. Was she in love? With him?  
“不行啊，笨蛋。我们得准备早餐了。天哪，就连美里小姐今天都比你早起。”她站起身，朝门口走去。真嗣的一只眼皮微微睁开，瞥见明日香穿着一件简单的黄色背心和短裤，几乎没遮住什么。她走出他的房间时，他忍不住微微一笑。其实从明日香刚进房间起，他就一直醒着，只是偷偷装睡。他知道明日香最近一直在做这些奇怪的事，但他还没完全弄明白该怎么应对。这个女孩让他摸不着头脑。她是在发情吗？他敢肯定，如果他提出这个想法，肯定会遭到某种尖锐物体的攻击，后果不堪设想。她是在爱恋吗？对他？

Making a sound somewhere between a snort and a chuckle, Shinji got out of bed and began to pull on his regular school clothes. He was about as attractive as a mouse, and had the charisma of a fart, there was no way in hell she was attracted to him.  
真嗣发出一声介于哼声和轻笑之间的声音，从床上爬起来，开始穿上他平常的校服。他就像只老鼠一样不起眼，魅力也不过尔尔，她怎么可能对他有意思。

But the fact was, mere moments ago, the beautiful half-European bombshell of a girl he had lived with for a considerably long time now had tried to kiss him. He had never been this confused in his entire life.  
但事实是，就在片刻之前，那个与他同居了相当长时间的美丽欧亚混血女孩，竟然试图吻他。他这辈子从未如此困惑过。

As he walked out of the room, he yawned again, already exhausted from having to think so hard this early in the morning.  
当他走出房间时，他又打了个哈欠，一大早就得这么费神，他已经感到疲惫不堪了。

"What do people want for breakfast?"  
“人们早餐想吃什么？”

In response to his question directed to the household at large, Asuka ran out of the kitchen, now wearing her regular school uniform. Forcing a slice of toast into his mouth, she ran into her room whilst yelling at him.  
面对他向全家人提出的问题，明日香从厨房冲了出来，此刻已换上了她平时的校服。她强行将一片吐司塞进嘴里，一边跑向自己的房间，一边对他大喊。

"There's no time! We've overslept, we gotta get to school, asap!"  
“没时间了！我们睡过头了，得赶紧去学校，立刻马上！”

"Wait, what about breakfast?!" A horrified Misato sounded out her fears from her bedroom. If there was no time to make something for her, she would have to make herself something. An apocalyptic scenario if there ever was one.  
“等等，那早餐怎么办？！”美里从卧室里惊恐地表达出她的担忧。如果没时间给她准备，她就得自己动手了。这简直是末日般的情景。

"Don't you start your new job today? Aren't you late?" Asuka's muffled voice echoed from her bedroom. Several seconds of silence echoed throughout the house before...  
"你今天不是开始新工作吗？不会迟到了吧？" 明日香从卧室里传来的声音有些模糊。几秒钟的沉默在家中回荡，随后...

"OH SHIT, I'M LATE!" "我靠，要迟到了！"

Shinji grinned as he wandered into his bedroom to grab his bag. First day back at school for the new semester and things were going fabulously. As he made his way to the door, the two female cohabitants barrelled out their respective bedrooms, Asuka grabbing his arm on the way out of the house, half-eaten toast hanging on for dear life as it bounced wildly from the corner of her mouth.  
真嗣笑着走进卧室去拿书包。新学期第一天返校，一切顺利得不得了。当他走向门口时，两位女室友分别从各自的卧室冲了出来，明日香在出门时抓住了他的手臂，半块吐司顽强地挂在嘴角，随着她狂奔而上下颠簸。

"Have a good day guys, watch the road, don't get hit by cars or anything." Misato yelled from her own vehicle's window as she pumped the ignition. Seconds later, she was racing down the road, speed limits be damned in their entirety.  
"祝你们今天顺利，注意看路，别被车撞了什么的。" 美里从她自己的车窗里喊道，同时发动引擎。几秒钟后，她便疾驰而去，全然不顾限速规定。

"The only car we're going to have to worry about on the roads is that damned Alpine she drives." Asuka breathed as they both ran towards the station. After a lengthy ten minute jog to the station, they touched through the station gates with their cards and just barely made the train as the doors began to close.  
"在路上我们唯一需要担心的车就是她那辆该死的阿尔派。" 明日香喘着气说，他们俩一起跑向车站。经过长达十分钟的慢跑，他们用卡片刷过车站闸门，就在车门即将关闭之际，勉强赶上了火车。

"That... was... too close..." Asuka panted as she caught her breath. Shinji nodded in agreement, eyes fixed to the floor as his lungs stopped trying to kill him. He slowly stood up, catching his balance, when his first trial of the morning began by fire.  
"那...真是...太险了..." 明日香喘着气，终于缓过气来。真嗣点头表示同意，目光紧盯着地面，他的肺部终于不再试图置他于死地。他慢慢站起身，稳住平衡，而早晨的第一个考验就这样突然降临。

His beautiful roommate was sweating from all the running they'd just finished in the sweltering Japanese summer heat, causing her white shirt to look a little see-through in certain areas. And amongst that, it seems like they had been in far too much of a hurry for her to remember to wear a bra...  
他那美丽的室友因为刚在酷热的日本夏日中奔跑而满头大汗，使得她的白衬衫在某些地方显得有些透明。而且，似乎他们当时太过匆忙，她甚至忘了穿胸罩……

He felt his face ignite as a hot, red flush crawled up his face. There was a fair amount of people crowded onto this train, and one look at the wrong angle, and Asuka might begin to be considered an exhibitionist.  
他感到自己的脸庞像被点燃了一样，一阵火热的红晕爬上了脸颊。这辆列车上挤满了人，只要一个不恰当的角度看过去，明日香就可能被误认为是暴露狂。

"Asuka..." He whispered frantically. "Come here!"  
“明日香……”他急切地低声呼唤，“过来这里！”

He received a look of confused anger for his trouble, but he didn't really care about her temper at the moment. Motioning with his hand, Asuka eventually came over to his side. He prayed to every god that would listen to protect him from the consequences of his forthcoming actions, and quickly wrapped his arms around the German girl. Her face lit up crimson as she began to try and push herself away, she wasn't anywhere near mentally prepared for Shinji's sudden forwardness.  
他为此得到了一个既困惑又愤怒的眼神，但他此刻并不太在意她的脾气。用手示意，明日香最终还是来到了他身边。他向每一位愿意倾听的神明祈祷，保佑他免受即将采取行动的后果，然后迅速用双臂环抱住这位德国女孩。她的脸颊顿时变得通红，开始试图推开他，她完全没有心理准备应对真嗣这突如其来的亲近。

"What the hell are you doing, idiot Shinji!?"  
“你到底在干什么，笨蛋真嗣？！”

"You appear to have a slight wardrobe malfunction, and I'm protecting you from the lecherous idiots that share our train."  
“你似乎有点衣着上的小问题，我在保护你免受那些和我们同乘一车的色狼们的骚扰。”

"I count you as one of those idiots as well, asshole! The hell are you talking about, 'wardrobe malfunction'?" Asuka looked down at her dress, before quickly realising Shinji had made the right, if unexpected move.  
"我把你也算作那些白痴之一了，混蛋！你到底在说什么，'服装故障'？" 明日香低头看了看自己的裙子，随即迅速意识到，尽管出乎意料，但真嗣的举动是正确的。

"You have got to be joking..."  
"你一定是在开玩笑吧..."

"See?" Shinji grinned. "For my actions in the line of duty, I deserve immunity from concussion after this is all over."  
"看吧？" 真嗣咧嘴一笑。"就凭我在任务中的表现，这一切结束后，我应该免受脑震荡之苦。

"You'll be lucky not to get my foot up your ass as soon as we get off this damn train." Asuka mumbled as she held onto Shinji's shirt. "Don't you dare move until then. I hope to god Hikari's got a spare bra I can steal..."  
"下了这该死的火车，你最好祈祷别让我一脚踹你屁股上。" 明日香咕哝着，紧紧抓着真嗣的衬衫。"在那之前你敢动一下试试。希望老天保佑，光有备用的胸罩让我偷..."

"Will that even fit?" "那能合适吗？"

"What in the hell are you trying to say Ikari!? Hikari and me are roughly the same size..."  
"你到底想说什么，碇真嗣！？我和光身材差不多..."

"Fantastic, I now know roughly the bra size of our class president." Shinji grinned as he thought of informing Toji when he survived this particular hell.  
"太棒了，我现在大概知道我们班长的胸围了。" 真嗣咧嘴一笑，想着如果能从这场特别的炼狱中活下来，一定要告诉透治。

"Why do you know my bra size!?" Asuka hissed, her face could boil water instantly. "Asshole! Pervert!" She began beating his chest angrily.  
"你怎么会知道我的胸围！？" 明日香低声怒斥，她的脸瞬间红得能烧开水。"混蛋！变态！" 她开始愤怒地捶打他的胸膛。

"Hey, who does all of the washing in our house?"  
"嘿，家里所有的衣服都是谁洗的？"

"Fair point, but that doesn't mean you have to memorise this stuff!"  
"说得好，但这并不意味着你必须记住这些！"

"To be fair, I wash all of the clothes so often, I could recite Misato and your sizes from memory easily. Let me think, I'm sure you're something like a B-cup, and your..." A firm grasp on his ear made for an abrupt punctuation.  
"说真的，我洗了那么多衣服，很容易就能从记忆中背出美里和你尺码。让我想想，我肯定你是 B 罩杯，还有你的..." 他耳朵被紧紧抓住，话音戛然而止。

"Try telling the whole damn train Shinji, see what happens." The man standing behind Asuka shifted uncomfortably. The pain increased on Shinji's ear, and only stopped after a sharp yelp of pain escaped his lips.  
"试试告诉整列火车的人，真嗣，看看会发生什么。"站在明日香身后的男人不安地挪动着。真嗣的耳朵疼痛加剧，直到他发出一声痛苦的尖叫才停止。

"I'm sorry!" He half-meant it too. Back in the day, he had been too nervous to even talk to Asuka. Being able to tease her like his was something out of a dream, and he wanted to relish every second of it. Rolling her eyes, Asuka buried her head into his chest, partly to escape their confounding situation, but partly as a way to enjoy Shinji's scent under pretense.  
"对不起！" 他这话也半真半假。回想当初，他紧张得连和明日香说话都不敢。如今能像这样逗弄她，简直是梦寐以求的事，他想要好好享受每一刻。明日香翻了个白眼，把头埋进他的胸膛，一方面是为了逃避这令人困惑的处境，另一方面也是借机享受真嗣的气息，尽管是假借名义。

"Stupid idiot..." She mumbled to herself.  
"笨蛋..." 她喃喃自语。

What felt like an entirely too-short eternity to them both later, they arrived at their stop, after which they raced to their classroom, just making it in the nick of time. After a hasty conversation with the class president, Asuka and Hikari quickly dashed for the girls locker room, returning with a satisfied smile on both girls faces. Asuka's smile quickly turned to irritation after spotting Shinji's knowing grin and sat down on her chair, her mood in a strange place between sour and bashful after the events of the morning replayed in her head. Caught up in her bubbly daydream, she didn't even notice as their usual, old and frail homeroom teacher wandered in.  
对他们两人来说，仿佛是过于短暂的永恒之后，他们到达了目的地，随后便冲向教室，刚好赶在最后一刻。与班长匆忙交谈后，明日香和光速奔向女更衣室，回来时两人脸上都带着满意的微笑。看到真嗣那副了然于心的笑容，明日香的笑容迅速转为恼怒，坐回自己的椅子上，早晨发生的事在脑海中重播，让她心情复杂，既酸涩又羞涩。沉浸在欢快的白日梦中，她甚至没注意到他们那老迈衰弱的班主任缓缓走进教室。

"Good morning class. I have an announcement. I may have mentioned to everyone last week how this class would be getting a new homeroom teacher soon, and I am pleased to announced she has arrived, albeit five minutes late for her first day." The class giggled in response, with Shinji agreeing with the crowd. Asuka, on the other hand, had a sudden sinking feeling that she couldn't quite explain.  
"同学们早上好。我有个通知。上周我可能跟大家提过，这门课很快会有新的班主任，我很高兴地宣布她已经到了，尽管她第一天就迟到了五分钟。" 班级里响起一阵轻笑，真嗣也随声附和。然而，明日香却突然感到一种难以名状的沉重感。

"Without further ado, if you would please, Miss..."  
"废话不多说，请您，小姐……"

"Katsuragi." A familiar voice echoed from the front of the class as an equally similar head of purple hair walked pridefully into their classroom. Their guardian, looking slightly tousled after what must have been plenty of near-death experiences with other vehicles, was standing at the front of the class, grinning directly at her two roommates.  
"葛城。" 一个熟悉的声音从教室前方传来，同样熟悉的紫色头发骄傲地走进了教室。他们的监护人，看起来在经历了无数次与死神擦肩而过的车辆事故后略显凌乱，站在教室前，直接对着她的两个室友咧嘴笑。

"Good morning class, I'm sorry for the delay. As mentioned before, my name is Misato Katsuragi, and starting today, I'm going to be your new homeroom teacher! I hope we can all get along and have an awesome year together!" No sooner had she stopped talking then all the boys in the class erupted into cheers. The cheers stopped quickly however, when two indignantly loud voices cut through all of the noise and screamed as loud as they could.  
"同学们早上好，很抱歉迟到了。之前提过，我叫葛城美里，从今天开始，我就是你们的新班主任了！希望我们能相处融洽，共同度过一个精彩的一年！"她话音刚落，班上的男生们就爆发出欢呼声。然而，欢呼声很快就被两声愤怒的大喊打断，那声音盖过了所有的噪音，尖锐而响亮。

"YOU COULD'VE GIVEN US A LIFT EARLIER!"  
"你本可以早点载我们一程的！"

### Chapter 2: Gods of Creation  
第二章：创世之神  

"Honey, I'm serious!" “亲爱的，我是认真的！”

"Gendo, I think you're finally starting to crack..."  
“源堂，我觉得你终于开始崩溃了……”

"Yui, I'm not losing it. I have a daughter, her name is Hitagi Senjougahara!"  
"结衣，我没有疯。我有个女儿，她叫战场原黑仪！"

"No dear, you have a son. His name is Shinji Ikari. Unless you've been hiding something from me for all these years. But thankfully I have the past experience to know that you're dreams go out of control at the touch of a hat."  
"不，亲爱的，你有个儿子。他叫碇真嗣。除非这些年你一直对我有所隐瞒。但幸好我有过去的经验，知道你的梦境一触即发就会失控。"

"...and she has a boyfriend called Koyomi Araragi, who saved her from her disease of weightlessness caught from the crabs."  
"……而且她有个男朋友叫阿良良木历，他救她摆脱了从螃蟹那里感染的失重病。"

"For the love of god..."  
"看在上帝的份上..."

The two scientists sat over the diagram readouts, mumbling to each other over cups of strong coffee. Both looked completely exhausted, and Gendo's eyes danced around the room, his lack of sleep for over seventy-two hours beginning to spark insanity in his mind, whilst his wife looked on disgruntled. She was used to her husband being a little crazy sometimes, but the lack of sleep to her was testing her patience. Plus, the potential miracle of an experiment they were waiting to test was driving her mad. Having to wait to see the unbelievable that you knew was coming was testing her normally gentle and patient personality.  
两位科学家坐在图表读数前，一边喝着浓咖啡一边喃喃自语。两人看起来都筋疲力尽，碇源堂的眼睛在房间里四处游移，连续七十多小时未眠开始在他的脑海中点燃疯狂的火花，而他的妻子则不满地看着他。她已经习惯了丈夫偶尔的疯狂，但缺乏睡眠对她来说正在考验她的耐心。此外，他们等待测试的实验潜在的奇迹也在逼疯她。不得不等待见证你明知即将到来的不可思议之事，正在考验她原本温柔耐心的性格。

"...and she had beautiful, long purple hair."  
"...而她有着美丽的长长的紫色头发。"

"Gendo! We've got only a few hours before we have to let the kids know the experiments that will change their lives forever. And we sure as hell can't trust Kyoko to do it! Get your head out of your ass and focus!"  
"源堂！我们只剩下几个小时就要告诉孩子们那些将永远改变他们生活的实验了。而且我们绝对不能指望绫波零来做这件事！别再逃避现实，集中精神！"

"...she was a bit of a bitch though. All tsundere, killed all the cute." With her blood vessels reaching a critical breaking point, Yui Ikari cracked her husband around the head with a heavy folder.  
"...她虽然有点泼辣。典型的傲娇，把可爱都扼杀了。" 随着血管濒临破裂的临界点，碇唯用一个厚重的文件夹猛击了丈夫的头。

"You're going to be the death of me one of these days..." Yui mumbled as she massaged her aching head.  
""你总有一天会把我气死的..."" 碇唯一边嘟囔着，一边揉着疼痛的头部。

---

With the shock of their new homeroom teacher finally beginning to recede, Asuka hung her head behind her chair, staring at the ceiling. She didn't think she could handle more surprises today. She wanted Shinji's delicious home-cooked bento in her stomach, but lunch was still hours away. Stomach grumbling, she turned to face Shinji, who happened to sit next to her, flashing him a look of practiced annoyance. His response was a confused expression and a shrug, which wasn't the kind of attention she had been looking for.  
随着新班主任带来的震惊逐渐消退，明日香低着头躲在椅子后面，盯着天花板。她觉得今天已经无法再承受更多的惊喜了。她渴望吃到真嗣亲手做的美味便当，但午餐时间还遥遥无期。肚子咕咕叫着，她转向坐在旁边的真嗣，露出了一副惯常的恼怒表情。他的回应却是一脸困惑和耸肩，这并不是她所期待的反应。

Tearing out a scrap of paper from her notepad, she quickly began writing a message.  
她从笔记本上撕下一张纸条，迅速开始写起信息来。

_"I'm bored!" “我好无聊！”_

Having received it, Shinji quickly read the note and glanced at her, flashing a smile that agreed with her.  
收到纸条后，真嗣迅速阅读了一遍，然后瞥了她一眼，露出了一个与她心意相通的微笑。

_"Me too. I'm not paying attention at all. You got any ideas to kill the time?"_ Asuka thought about the response for a little while, until a small grin crept into her expression.  
“我也是，根本没在听。你有什么打发时间的主意吗？”明日香思考了一会儿，直到她的脸上慢慢浮现出一丝微笑。

_"Let's play a game!" “我们来玩游戏吧！”_

_"What kind of game?" “什么类型的游戏？”_

_"20 questions, gone wild!"_ Shinji's eyes widened to impossible sizes as he read the response. It was all she could do to not laugh out loud. After she'd received the affirmative from Shinji, she began their little game.  
“20 个问题，疯狂版！” 真嗣的眼睛瞪得大到不可思议，他读着回复。她尽力忍住不笑出声。在得到真嗣的肯定后，她开始了他们的小游戏。

_"Out of all the girls in the class, who's the cutest?"  
“在班上所有女生中，谁最可爱？”_

_"That's not a fair question..."  
"那问题不公平……"_

_"Answer the damn question, stupid Shinji!"  
"回答那个该死的问题，愚蠢的真嗣！"_

_"A certain fiery fräulein I know..."_ He had the audacity to look sheepish, but his comment made her happy. At least he had noticed she was an attractive organism of the female species. Pencil in his mouth, Shinji finally came up with a question that surprised her.  
""我认识的一位热情的女士……"" 他居然厚颜无耻地露出了尴尬的表情，但他的话让她感到高兴。至少他注意到了她是个有魅力的女性生物。嘴里叼着铅笔，真嗣终于想出了一个让她惊讶的问题。

_"Is there anyone that you like?"_ Her heartbeat flared as she struggled to find an immediate answer. She wasn't mentally ready to tell him that she liked him, but one wrong move and she could hint to Shinji that it wasn't him she liked, dashing her hopes of a future relationship entirely.  
"你有喜欢的人吗？" 她的心跳加速，努力寻找一个即时的答案。她还没准备好告诉他她喜欢他，但一旦说错话，就可能暗示给真嗣她喜欢的不是他，彻底粉碎了她对未来关系的希望。

_"If you mean like as in people I can bear with most on a daily basis, I'd have to choose you I guess."_ After sneaking him the note, she hid her face away from him, afraid she'd let slip her innermost thoughts. She heard a surprised gasp of air coming from his direction, before hearing the pencil scratching on the paper again.  
"如果你是指日常生活中我能忍受最多的人，我想我得选你吧。" 递给他纸条后，她把脸藏了起来，生怕泄露内心的真实想法。她听到他那边传来惊讶的吸气声，然后又听到铅笔在纸上划过的声音。

_"You write incredibly frustrating answers, I have no idea what that means in the female language."  
"你写的答案真是让人抓狂，我完全不懂这在女性语言里是什么意思。"_

She came close to whacking him across the head with her textbook, but settled with glaring at him as though looks could cause people to spontaneously combust.  
她差点用教科书敲他的头，但最终只是狠狠地瞪着他，仿佛眼神能让人自燃。

_"Read too much into it and I'll have you for lunch instead of the damn bento!"  
“别想太多，不然我可要把你当午餐吃了，而不是那该死的便当！”_

As soon as she handed it over, she regretted writing the response. She meant it as something angry, but replaying the words in her head and it began to sound... flirty? Her fears were confirmed when Shinji covered his mouth, trying not to laugh. Whimpering in exasperation, she buried her head in her arms on her desk. The rest of the day passed by in a slow, painful, agonizing fashion.  
她一递过去就后悔写了那个回复。本意是表达愤怒，但回想起来，那些话听起来...有点挑逗？当真嗣捂住嘴，努力不笑出声时，她的担忧得到了证实。她懊恼地呜咽一声，把头埋在桌上的手臂里。剩下的时间里，日子过得缓慢、痛苦且煎熬。

"This is so disappointing."  
这真是太令人失望了。

"Gendo, focus!" "源堂，专注点！"

"But, but...!" Gendo Ikari was looking at his son, a mixture of disappointment and fear written over his face. "That's not my precious Hitagi!"  
"但是，但是...！" 碇源堂看着他的儿子，脸上交织着失望和恐惧。"那不是我珍贵的战场原！"

"...what?" Shinji mumbled, incredibly confused at his incomprehensible father's words.  
"...什么？" 真嗣喃喃自语，对他的父亲那难以理解的话语感到极度困惑。

"Hitagi! My daughter!" “黑仪！我的女儿！”

_***WHACK* *啪***_

The elder Ikari male crumpled to the ground, with Yui Ikari standing over him, a look of pure rage covering her face.  
老式的碇家男性倒在地上，碇唯站在他上方，脸上覆盖着纯粹的愤怒。

"That's enough! Sleep there for a few minutes, I can do the introduction by myself at least." Both Asuka and Shinji looked suitably horrified. Shinji's mother rarely ever displayed anger, so whenever her rage did display itself, it was terrifying.  
"够了！在那儿睡几分钟吧，至少我自己能做个介绍。" 明日香和真嗣都露出了适度的惊恐。真嗣的母亲很少表现出愤怒，所以每当她的怒火显现时，都极其可怕。

"We've brought you here today to explain to you the nature of our experiments. Neither of us have slept for over three days, so your father is going insane and I'm getting a little... irritated." Yui walked over to a nearby laptop connected to the ceiling-mounted projector, flicking everything on. The room dimmed as one of the walls parallel to the two teenagers lit-up with an image. From what they could tell, they were looking at a simple, white-walled room with nothing inside. There didn't seem to be anything interesting about the room, and Shinji looked at his mother fearfully.  
"今天带你们来这里，是为了向你们解释我们的实验性质。我们俩已经超过三天没睡觉了，所以你父亲快疯了，而我也有点...烦躁。" 绫波走到一台连接着天花板投影仪的笔记本电脑旁，打开了所有设备。房间暗了下来，与两个青少年平行的墙壁亮起了一张图像。从他们能看到的来看，这是一个空无一物的简单白色墙壁房间。这个房间似乎没有什么有趣的地方，真嗣害怕地看着他的母亲。

"...maybe you've both been in here a little too long, mother."  
"...也许你们俩在这里待得太久了，妈妈。"

A fierce look of boiling anger was his response, causing Shinji to whimper like a rabbit, cowering behind Asuka. The German girl had given him enough scary looks that he thought he was ready for anything, but even Asuka herself was shaking in fear.  
他眼中燃烧的怒火如此猛烈，让真嗣像兔子一样呜咽着，躲在明日香身后瑟瑟发抖。德国女孩给他的可怕眼神已经够多了，他以为自己已经无所畏惧，但就连明日香自己也在恐惧中颤抖。

"Admittedly, it doesn't look like much, but that room is the single, most advanced example of virtual reality engineering in the world. What you're looking at is the room in its default state. I need the both of you to go into that room, and... test its capabilities." After a flick of a switch, a small door materialized underneath the projected image.  
“诚然，它看起来并不起眼，但那房间是世界上最为先进的虚拟现实工程实例。你们现在看到的是它的默认状态。我需要你们两个进入那个房间，并……测试它的性能。”随着开关轻轻一拨，投影图像下方凭空出现了一扇小门。

"Go." At her encouragement, Asuka and Shinji walked towards the door and pushed it open. The exact same room as they had seen on the projection greeted them.  
“去吧。”在她的鼓励下，明日香和真嗣走向那扇门，推开它。映入眼帘的，正是他们在投影中看到的那个房间。

_"Stand in the middle."_ Yui's voice could now be heard over a communications system, the metallic voice reverberating around the room. As they were told, they stood in the middle of the room, looking at each other with confused faces.  
"站在中间。" 通过通讯系统，Yui 的声音现在可以被听到，金属质感的声音在房间里回荡。正如他们被告知的那样，他们站在房间中央，面面相觑，脸上带着困惑的表情。

As she was typing furiously into the computer, Gendo began to awaken, getting to his feet as held his aching head. Yui noticed the sound of her husband returning to consciousness and swiftly pointed to the projection of the room, now with the two teenagers inside.  
当她疯狂地在电脑上打字时，Gendo 开始苏醒，他站起身来，手扶着疼痛的头。Yui 注意到丈夫恢复意识的声音，迅速指向房间的投影，现在里面有两个青少年。

"It's your cue." "轮到你了。"

Gendo nodded as he looked towards the projection. Inside the now sealed room, his face appeared before the two children as a small, floating window.  
源堂点头，目光转向投影。在如今已被封闭的房间内，他的脸出现在两个孩子面前，化作一个小小的悬浮窗口。

_"You are both now inside a virtual reality. However, your bodies are still physical, meaning you will be able to touch anything around you as though it existed in real life."  
“你们现在身处虚拟现实之中。不过，你们的身体仍然是实体的，这意味着你们能够像周围的一切真实存在一样去触摸它们。”_

"We can... touch virtual objects? That's breaking a few laws of physics, isn't it?" Asuka said in disbelief towards the floating image of Shinji's father. The face smiled mischievously back at her.  
“我们可以……触摸虚拟物体？这岂不是打破了物理定律吗？”明日香对着悬浮的碇司令影像表示怀疑。那张脸则带着一丝狡黠的微笑回望着她。

_"Would you like an example? Shinji, imagine a small animal, like a cat on the floor in front of you."  
"想要个例子吗？真嗣，想象一下你面前地板上有只小动物，比如一只猫。"_

With an exasperated expression directed towards Asuka, Shinji began to look at the floor, imagining a jet-black cat. Within seconds, a physical cat appeared before them, looking up at them, slightly confused as to why it was there.  
带着对明日香无奈的表情，真嗣开始注视地板，想象着一只乌黑的猫。几秒钟内，一只实体的猫出现在他们面前，抬头看着他们，略显困惑为何自己会在这里。

"You have got to be joking...!" Asuka slowly breathed as she watched the cat walk towards her, and physically rub its head on her leg. "How...!? I can feel it!"  
"你一定是在开玩笑吧...！" 明日香缓缓呼吸着，看着那只猫向她走来，用头蹭着她的腿。"怎么可能...！我能感觉到它！"

_"It's a confirmed success!"_ An incredibly overexcited sounding Yui Ikari shrieked from the communications channel. _"Stability at eighty-seven percent, no problems with the children's physical composition. Phase two, go!"_ She yelled the final words at Gendo, who clapped his hands with excitement.  
"确认成功了！" 通讯频道中传来极为兴奋的绫波唯的声音。"稳定性达到百分之八十七，孩子们的身体结构没有问题。第二阶段，开始！" 她对着碇源堂大喊，碇源堂兴奋地拍手。

_"Next, Asuka, we need you to imagine an environment. Anything will do, but try not to overcomplicate it. Somewhere you would be familiar with would be ideal."  
"接下来，明日香，我们需要你想象一个环境。任何地方都可以，但尽量不要过于复杂。选择一个你熟悉的地方会更好。"_

Her look of shock widened as Asuka looked back at Shinji, the black cat now in her arms as it purred contentedly. She closed her eyes, and a few seconds later, the classroom that they had been studying in only hours beforehand materialized around them. The detail was immaculate, and apart from the lack of other students, everything was a perfect replication of the room at their school.  
明日香看着怀中那只黑色猫咪，它正满足地咕噜咕噜叫着，她的震惊表情更加明显。她闭上眼睛，几秒钟后，他们几小时前还在学习的教室在他们周围实体化了。细节完美无缺，除了缺少其他学生外，一切都完美复制了学校的那个房间。

_"Phase Two, success! Anomalies holding steady at five percent, possibly due to hosts imagination processes. Phase three!"_ Yui was pounding the keyboard so fast, she was beginning to worry about her fingers breaking from the pressure.  
"第二阶段，成功！异常稳定在百分之五，可能是由于宿主的想象过程所致。第三阶段！" 结衣敲击键盘的速度如此之快，她开始担心自己的手指会因压力而断裂。

_"This time, Shinji, we need you to imagine a location from a long time ago, something you won't remember perfectly."_ His father directed him, and Shinji nodded, beginning to concentrate on a forest that his family had once taken him to when he was six-years old.  
"这次，真嗣，我们需要你想象一个很久以前的地点，一些你不会记得很清楚的东西。" 他的父亲指导他，真嗣点头，开始集中精神回想一个他六岁时家人带他去过的森林。

Slowly this time, the forest in his mind began to appear around him. But in certain areas, there were static patches.  
这次慢慢地，他脑海中的森林开始在他周围显现。但在某些区域，出现了静态斑块。

_"Success! Anomalies at sixty percent, host's health remains stable!"  
"成功！异常率 60%，宿主健康状况保持稳定！"_

_"I remember this forest."_ His father looked around the room through his window. Yui turned to him and pointed at the entrance to the room.  
"我记得这片森林。" 他的父亲透过窗户环视房间。Yui 转向他，指向房间的入口。

"Phase four, get in there!" Gendo nodded and hurried to the door, entering and standing next to the two utterly confused children. Closing his eyes, he focused on the same memory that Shinji had summoned.  
"第四阶段，进去吧！" Gendo 点头，急忙走向门口，进入房间并站在两个完全困惑的孩子旁边。他闭上眼睛，专注于与 Shinji 召唤的相同的记忆。

The static patches around them from Shinji's memories began to fuzz and stabilize into the remaining sections of forest that had been missing before. Before long, the complete forest surrounding the three open-mouthed people.  
来自真嗣记忆中的静态片段开始模糊并稳定下来，逐渐填补了之前缺失的森林部分。不久，一片完整的森林环绕在三位目瞪口呆的人周围。

_"Memory Merge, success!"_ Yui was beside herself as she came close to a mental breakdown from excitement. _"Phase four is a success!"_  
“记忆融合，成功！”由依激动得几乎要精神崩溃。“第四阶段成功了！”

Gendo nodded, grinning from ear-to-ear, before turning around and looking at the electrified Shinji and Asuka. Pointing towards the cat, his grin seemed to grow even wider.  
源堂点点头，笑得合不拢嘴，然后转身看向被电击的真嗣和明日香。他指向那只猫，笑容似乎更加灿烂了。

"Take it outside of the room."  
“把它带出房间。”

For everything that had happened so far, the next thing that would await them had seemed to shock them a hundred times more. But when Asuka nervously opened the door to the unbelievable room, and stepped outside holding the imagined cat, which didn't disappear as she exited and shut the door behind her, the realization of the experiments that had happened today would change everything as they knew it suddenly began to dawn on them.  
迄今为止发生的种种，接下来等待他们的似乎是百倍于前的震惊。然而，当明日香紧张地推开那不可思议房间的门，怀抱着想象中的猫踏出房门，那猫并未随她出门并关上门而消失时，今日实验的真相开始在他们心中悄然浮现，彻底颠覆了他们所知的一切。

They had created life, from the imagination of a teenage boy, that persisted and survived from outside its virtual incubator. The cat meowed happily at Asuka, who's eyes were as wide as dinner plates.  
他们从一位少年脑海中的想象里创造了生命，这生命顽强地存活于虚拟孵化器之外。那只猫对着明日香欢快地喵喵叫，她的眼睛瞪得像餐盘一样大。

As of right now, Asuka Langley Soryu and the Ikari family were essentially gods of creation.  
从现在起，明日香·兰格雷·索耶和碇家实质上成为了创造之神。

**_They were gods. 他们是神。_**

### Chapter 3: In Holy Matrimony  
第三章：神圣婚姻  

Asuka was bouncing her leg up and down under her desk as she leaned her face on her hand, trying to look bored. Together with Shinji, they had gone to school the next day after they had become literal gods. So trying to keep a disinterested look was proving to be difficult, as she thought of the million different ways this power could be used.  
明日香一边用手撑着脸，试图装出一副无聊的样子，一边在桌子底下不停地抖腿。她和真嗣在成为名副其实的神之后，第二天就去了学校。现在，她正努力保持一副漠不关心的表情，但脑海中却在思考着这种力量可以用来做无数种事情，这让她很难装得下去。

As a precaution, Shinji's parents had told them under no circumstances were they to tell anyone else about this ability. They had been clever enough to understand that nations from across the world would easily abuse this power, so keeping their mouth shut was of the utmost priority.  
为了以防万一，真嗣的父母告诫他们，无论如何都不能向任何人透露这种能力。他们足够聪明，明白世界各地的国家很容易滥用这种力量，因此守口如瓶是最重要的。

She glanced quickly at the bracelet on her left wrist. It's design looked almost futuristic, a deep crimson color with splashes of red decorated its design. Shinji wore an identical bracelet, although his was a mix of white and blue, complimented with the odd splash of black. These bracelets were designed to give them immediate access to their powers, without having to go back to the room. She wasn't quite sure how it worked, but it was apparently linked to the room in some way, enabling them to summon objects, or change their environment around them at will. And the most frustrating thing about the bracelets was that neither Gendo nor Yui had said a damn thing about how to activate them.  
她迅速瞥了一眼左手腕上的手镯。其设计看起来颇具未来感，深红色为主，点缀着红色斑点。真嗣佩戴着同样款式的手镯，不过他的以白色和蓝色为主，间或夹杂着黑色斑点。这些手镯旨在让他们无需返回房间就能立即使用自己的力量。她不太确定其工作原理，但显然与房间有某种联系，使他们能够随心所欲地召唤物品或改变周围环境。而关于手镯最令人沮丧的一点是，源堂和唯从未透露过如何激活它们。

As Asuka cursed the two mad scientists, the door to the class slid open, revealing Misato looking cheerful.  
当明日香咒骂着那两位疯狂科学家时，教室的门滑开了，露出满脸笑容的美里。

"Good morning, my fellow nutcases. I have some good news for most of you and some bad news for two of you in particular."  
“早上好，我的各位疯子们。我有一些好消息要告诉你们大多数人，也有一些坏消息特别针对你们中的两位。”

"This'll be what she was so excited about this morning." Asuka thought as she recalled their guardian giggling like a drunk schoolgirl whilst they had all been eating breakfast together this morning. It had been in equal parts curious and terrifying. Try as they might, neither she nor Shinji could extract any useful information out of her.  
“这应该就是她今早那么兴奋的原因了。”明日香回忆起今早大家一起吃早餐时，他们的监护人像喝醉的女学生一样咯咯笑个不停。这既让人好奇又感到恐怖。无论她和真嗣怎么努力，都无法从她那里套出任何有用信息。

"I have the pleasure of introducing a new transfer student to everyone today. Please treat her kindly everyone! Miss Ayanami, you may enter."  
“今天我有幸向大家介绍一位新转来的学生。请大家好好待她！绫波同学，你可以进来了。”

At her words, a young girl with eye-catching light-blue hair walked into the classroom. As she turned to face the class, Asuka noticed her eyes were a bright, slightly-unnerving crimson. But more importantly, she noticed that the transfer student bore a startling resemblance to Shinji's mother. And on top of that, she was incredibly cute.  
随着她的话音落下，一位拥有引人注目的淡蓝色头发的少女走进了教室。当她转身面对全班时，明日香注意到她的眼睛是明亮而略显不安的猩红色。但更重要的是，她注意到这位转学生与真嗣的母亲惊人地相似。而且，她还非常可爱。

"I swear to god, if I catch Shinji staring at her, I'm going to..." Asuka muttered as she turned around to look at Shinji. She wasn't expecting his expression to be laced with shock and horror in equal measure. As she wondered what had him so scared, the transfer student began to speak.  
"我发誓，如果我抓到真嗣盯着她看，我就……" 明日香喃喃自语着转过身去看真嗣。她没想到他的表情会如此震惊和恐惧交织。正当她疑惑是什么让他如此害怕时，转学生开始说话了。

"My name is Rei Ayanami, its a pleasure to meet you." She did a small bow, and as she looked up again, Asuka noticed her flash a smile in Shinji's direction. Whipping her head back, she saw that Shinji's expression had grown a hundred times more petrified looking.  
"我叫绫波零，很高兴见到你们。" 她微微鞠了一躬，抬起头时，明日香注意到她向真嗣的方向露出了一个微笑。明日香猛地转过头，看到真嗣的表情变得更加惊恐。

"And be careful boys, she's technically already spoken for!" Misato piped up from her chair near the window. All of the boys looked at her, both horrified and confused at the same time. Winking at Rei, she nodded towards her.  
"还有，男孩们小心点，她理论上已经有主了！" 美里从窗边的椅子上插话道。所有的男生都看向她，既惊恐又困惑。美里对绫波眨了眨眼，向她点头示意。

"It's time to reveal the biggest news of all." It sounded like Misato was having a hard time containing her excitement. Rei nodded, suddenly looking bashful and shy, began to walk towards the centre of the class, specifically to Shinji's chair. After having reached her destination, she smiled at him.  
"是时候揭晓最大的新闻了。" 美里听起来难以抑制她的兴奋。绫波点点头，突然显得害羞起来，开始走向教室中央，特别是向真嗣的椅子走去。到达目的地后，她对他微笑。

"It is good to see you after all this time, Shinji. Here, this is for you." She placed a small box in front of him, a very familiar-looking box.  
"这么久没见，真嗣，很高兴见到你。这个，是给你的。" 她把一个小盒子放在他面前，一个看起来非常眼熟的盒子。

"What on god's green earth is in that box Shinji." Asuka whispered, dreading the answer she knew was most likely coming. Shinji stared at the box, paralyzed in fear. This couldn't be happening. He had thought this whole thing had been forgotten about years ago.  
"那盒子里到底是什么鬼东西，真嗣。" 明日香低声说，害怕即将听到的答案。真嗣盯着盒子，恐惧得动弹不得。这不可能是真的。他以为这一切早在几年前就被遗忘了。

He picked up the box with trembling hands. The whole class waited on baited breath, the atmosphere was electric, to an almost lethal degree. He gently prised open the box, confirming his worst fears. Sitting snugly inside the box were two, sparkling engagement rings.  
他用颤抖的双手拿起盒子。全班屏息以待，气氛紧张到几乎致命的程度。他小心翼翼地打开盒子，证实了自己最深的恐惧。盒子里稳稳地放着两枚闪闪发光的订婚戒指。

The whole class erupted into pandemonium.  
全班顿时陷入一片混乱。

"...what?" Asuka looked mental, with one eye stretched far wider than it should have been able to, a demonic grin danced across her face. "WHAT? WHAAAT!?"  
“...什么？” 明日香看起来精神错乱，一只眼睛睁得比正常能张开的还要大，脸上跳跃着恶魔般的笑容。“什么？什么！？”

"SHINJI, YOU BASTARD!" Toji Suzuhara, his supposed best friend and pillar of support during most of their hard times together, looked about ready to punch him square in the face.  
"真嗣，你这个混蛋！" 他的所谓最好的朋友，也是大多数艰难时刻的支柱，铃原东治看起来几乎要一拳打在他脸上。

"THE HELL IS ALL THIS ABOUT!? You've already chummy with the hottest girl in the school, where the fuck are engagement rings coming from!? With this new chick!?"  
"这他妈的都是怎么回事！？你已经和学校里最火的女孩打得火热了，哪来的订婚戒指！？还是和这个新来的！？"

"Suzuhara, language!" "铃原，注意言辞！"

"Shove it Class Prez! This is a national emergency!" His retort ignited a blazing fire under the temper of their class president, Hikari Horaki. Her face matched Asuka's current expression in terms of pure terror, immediately rushing to Toji and grasping his ear with the strength of an enraged lion.  
"闭嘴，班长！这是全国性的紧急情况！" 他的反驳如同点燃了导火索，激起了班长光里堇的怒火。她的脸色与明日香此刻的表情一样，充满了纯粹的恐惧，立刻冲向东治，用狮子般的力道抓住了他的耳朵。

"Would you like to repeat that, Suzuhara?"  
"你愿意再说一遍吗，铃原？"

Meanwhile, Shinji had about five seconds to live, as his situation changed for the worse when Rei suddenly put his arms around him. A pure explosion of rage erupted from Asuka, as her table went flying across the room.  
与此同时，真嗣的生命只剩下大约五秒钟，因为情况急转直下，零突然抱住了他。明日香爆发出纯粹的愤怒，她的桌子飞过整个房间。

"WHAT ARE YOU DONIG TO HIM!?" She was barely stopping herself from launching at the blue-haired girl, who looked back at her, confused by Asuka's rage.  
“你在对他做什么！？”她几乎控制不住自己冲向那个蓝发女孩，而对方回望着她，对明日香突如其来的愤怒感到困惑。

"I'm simply hugging him. It's been at least six years since I last saw my childhood friend, and it's time for our promise to be fulfilled."  
我只是紧紧拥抱他。自从上次见到儿时好友，至少已有六年光阴，是时候兑现我们的承诺了。

"What. Fucking. Promise?" Asuka aimed the icy question at both Shinji and Rei. "I'm pretty sure I've just crapped myself..." Shinji moaned as the two girls continued to glare at each other.  
“什么。该死的。承诺？”明日香冷冷地向真嗣和绫波发问。“我敢肯定我刚刚吓得尿裤子了……”真嗣呻吟着，两个女孩依旧互相瞪视。

"IKARI, SORYU, LANGUAGE!" Hikari roared from behind him, still wrestling with Toji.  
“伊卡里，索琉，语言！”光从他身后咆哮道，仍在与托吉扭打。

"His father promised my father that we would be engaged to marry when we both came to the right age. It has been a long time coming, but I have been waiting for this day to finally reunite with Shinji, for a long time." Rei glanced down at the terrified boy, a small blush creeping onto her face.  
“他的父亲曾向我父亲承诺，当我们都到了适婚年龄时，我们将订婚结婚。这一天已经等了很久，但我一直在等待与真嗣重逢的这一天，已经很久了。” 绫波瞥了一眼惊恐的男孩，脸上泛起一丝淡淡的红晕。

"But... why...?" Asuka's rage could be heard between every whispered syllable. "Why him?"  
“但是...为什么...？” 明日香的声音中夹杂着愤怒，每个字都几乎在颤抖。“为什么是他？”

A moment's silence passed, as Rei thought about her response. She looked up, a firm determination present in her eyes.  
一阵沉默过后，绫波思考着如何回应。她抬起头，眼中闪烁着坚定的决心。

"Without Shinji Ikari, I would not be alive today."  
没有碇真嗣，我今天就不会活着。

The silence returned, echoing around the classroom. Rei stood up, letting Shinji go.  
沉默再次降临，回荡在教室中。丽站起身，放开了真嗣。

"I was saved from a debilitating illness, not by medicine, nor by the magic of modern day science, but through the kindness that Shinji brought to me, everyday I sat in a lonely medical ward."  
"我被一种顽疾所困，不是药物，也不是现代科学的魔法救了我，而是每天坐在孤独的病房里，真嗣带给我的善意。"

"For most of my life, I had been alone. I hadn't had any real friends, nor was my father around often, due to his job. My mother passed away at a young age, and I was too shy to make any friends of my own. Then, due to unfortunate circumstances, I found myself waking up in a medical ward at NERV, where my father worked. I was told that it would take a miracle to save me from my illness."  
"我大半生都是孤独一人。我没有真正的朋友，父亲也因为工作不常在家。母亲在我年幼时便去世了，而我太害羞，无法结交朋友。后来，由于不幸的境遇，我发现自己醒来时身处 NERV 的医疗病房，那里是我父亲工作的地方。我被告知，要从我的病中得救，需要一个奇迹。"

"It was then I first met Shinji. His parents both worked at NERV, and his father, who is my father's cousin, had brought him to work one day, to show him some of the experiments that were going on. By mistake, Shinji got lost and ended up in my room. And instead of leaving, he stayed with me and chatted with me. We stayed there for hours until his parents eventually discovered him."  
那时我第一次遇见了真嗣。他的父母都在 NERV 工作，而他父亲，也就是我父亲的表弟，某天带他来参观正在进行的一些实验。不巧的是，真嗣迷路了，误打误撞进了我的房间。他没有选择离开，而是留下来和我聊天。我们就这样待了好几个小时，直到他的父母终于找到了他。

"I begged him to stay, and through various circumstances, Shinji was allowed to visit me. Almost everyday he would come to my room, sometimes bringing games to play. And eventually, over time, my illness began to dissipate. Because of those happy days I spent with Shinji, he gave to me a miracle. The only thing I can give to him in return is my love, and everlasting matrimony."  
我恳求他留下，在种种机缘下，真嗣得以来探望我。几乎每天他都会来到我的房间，有时还会带上游戏一起玩。渐渐地，随着时间的推移，我的病情开始好转。因为与真嗣共度的那些快乐时光，他为我带来了奇迹。我能回报给他的，唯有我的爱，以及永恒的婚姻。

The rest of the day passed agonizingly slowly, with Rei and Asuka butting heads with each other at every opportunity. The majority of their teachers were terrified of the spectacle, not to mention Shinji felt a constant fear of dying from a terror-induced heart attack.  
这一天剩下的时间过得异常缓慢，丽和明日香一有机会就互相较劲。大多数老师都对这一幕感到恐惧，更别提真嗣一直担心自己会因惊吓过度而心脏病发作。

The last bell ringing was heavenly music to his ears. He just wanted to go home, eat and sleep the nightmare of the day away. Catching sight of Misato walking towards him, a slightly apologetic expression on her face, he realized that his troubles were far from over.  
最后一声铃响对他而言宛如天籁。他只想回家，吃顿饭，然后睡一觉，把这糟糕的一天抛诸脑后。瞥见美里朝他走来，脸上带着些许歉意的表情，他意识到自己的麻烦远未结束。

"Shinji... How's it going?" She tried to sound as lighthearted as possible, but even she knew how tough today had been on him.  
"真嗣... 还好吗？" 她尽量让自己的语气听起来轻松愉快，但就连她自己也知道今天对他来说有多艰难。

"I want to find my father and strangle him." He said, exasperated. "He told me he had 'smoothed things over' with this promise."  
"我想找到我父亲然后掐死他。" 他气愤地说，"他告诉我他已经‘把事情摆平了’，还用这个承诺来搪塞我。"

"Do you not like Rei?" Misato looked at him quizzically. He shook his head.  
"你不喜欢绫波吗？" 美里疑惑地看着他。他摇了摇头。

"It's not that. It just came out of nowhere, that's all. All these years, I wasn't too worried about it, because I thought Rei saw me as a friend, and nothing else. But then she transfer into my class, declares her love and dedication and I feel like somebody's thrown a metaphorical brick in my face. It's all too sudden, I don't know what's going on..."  
“不是那样的。只是它突然就出现了，仅此而已。这么多年，我并不太担心，因为我以为丽把我当朋友，仅此而已。但后来她转到了我们班，宣布她的爱意和奉献，我感觉像是有人朝我脸上扔了一块隐喻的砖头。这一切都太突然了，我不知道发生了什么...”

Misato nodded sympathetically, ruffling his hair. "I understand kiddo. Love's never an easy battle to fight, especially when you've got a pretty thing like Asuka hanging around day and night. But things will get better."  
美里同情地点点头，揉乱了他的头发。“我理解你，孩子。爱情从来都不是一场容易的战斗，尤其是当你身边有个像明日香这样漂亮的人日夜相伴时。但情况会好转的。”

Her smile quickly turned into a look of panic as she realized something.  
她的微笑迅速变成了惊慌的表情，因为她意识到了什么。

"Actually, wait, scratch that, things are going to get a whole lot worse!" Looking up at her, his own face now in a panic, he trembled at the thought of more bad news involving the girls.  
“实际上，等等，别提了，事情会变得更糟！”他抬头看着她，自己的脸上也露出了惊慌，一想到还会有关于女孩们的坏消息，他就颤抖不已。

"I totally forgot to mention that Rei's moving in with us!"  
“我完全忘了提，丽要搬来和我们一起住了！”

After that, he was instructed to explain the news to Asuka. Misato offered him a stab/bulletproof vest she had for 'reasons'. Politely refusing, he made his way to where she thought she might be. Discovering her in their homeroom classroom, sitting on his desk, swinging her legs as she looked outside, she turned to face him as he walked in. Noticing his grim expression, her own face dropped into a dark scowl.  
之后，他被指示向明日香解释新闻内容。美里递给他一件因某种原因备有的防刺/防弹背心，他礼貌地拒绝了，然后前往她可能所在的地方。在他们的教室里找到她，她正坐在他的桌子上，晃着双腿望向窗外，听到他进来，她转过身来。注意到他阴沉的表情，她的脸也沉了下来，露出了阴郁的怒容。

"Oh god... what now?" "天哪... 又怎么了？"

After he quickly explained, he could have sworn the classroom had literally exploded with her fury.  
在他迅速解释之后，他几乎可以发誓教室里她的愤怒简直像爆炸了一样。

---

They had entered the park that was on the way home. Asuka stomped ahead of him, fuming. She was that angry that he could literally feel the burning aura radiating from her. He hadn't felt this scared of her since when they were kids, back when he had been much more shy.  
他们走进了回家路上的那个公园。明日香怒气冲冲地在他前面跺着脚走，她的愤怒如此强烈，以至于他都能感受到从她身上散发出的炽热气场。自从他们还是孩子，那时他更加害羞以来，他从未如此害怕过她。

"Asuka..." He gently tried to talk to her, but his response was a dangerous sounding growl. His shoulders slumped as he mumbled towards her back.  
"明日香..." 他轻声试图与她交谈，却只得到一声危险的低吼。他垂下肩膀，对着她的背影喃喃自语。

"I'm sorry..." "对不起..."

Time froze. Along with Asuka's footsteps, and the world around them seemed to quieten. It sounded like a normal thing to say, but Asuka's response was a small sob. It was the most heartbreaking sound he could have heard from her. The invincible Asuka, the girl who never backed down. The girl that every single male at their school was attracted to, yet equally terrified of, was quietly sobbing in front of him.  
时间仿佛凝固了。随着明日香的脚步，周围的世界似乎也安静下来。这句话听起来很平常，但明日香的回应却是一声轻微的啜泣。这是他最不愿从她口中听到的声音。那个无所不能的明日香，那个从不退缩的女孩。学校里每一个男生都为之倾倒，却又同样畏惧的女孩，正默默地在他面前啜泣。

"Wha- Asuka!?" He rushed up to her side, and caught a glimpse of her face. Crystal tears swept down her face as she stood there, trying to no avail to rub her eyes, attempting to stem the flow.  
"什- 明日香！？" 他急忙冲到她身边，瞥见了她的脸。晶莹的泪水顺着她的脸颊滑落，她站在那里，徒劳地试图揉搓眼睛，试图止住泪水的流淌。

"Shinji... stop, don't... don't look at me..."  
"真嗣... 停下，不要... 别看着我..."

"Why are you crying Asuka? I'm sorry! If its something I said, I'm sorry!" He hadn't apologized to her like this since they were kids. Back then, she had yelled at him for apologizing all the time, threatening to punch him in the face if he kept on at it. He tried to curb his use of apologies since then, but he couldn't help it. Not when his best friend in the world, the girl who had stood by him through all hell, was crying his eyes out in front of him.  
“为什么你在哭，明日香？对不起！如果是因为我说了什么，我道歉！” 自从他们还是孩子以来，他就没有这样向她道过歉。那时，她曾因为他总是道歉而对他大吼大叫，威胁说如果他再这样下去就要揍他一顿。从那以后，他试图克制自己的道歉，但此刻他无法控制。毕竟，眼前这位世界上最好的朋友，那个无论多么艰难都一直陪伴在他身边的女孩，正泪流满面地站在他面前。

"Asuka..." “明日香……”

"She's... she's going to take you away from me!" She was talking about what had happened with Rei. "I've known you since god knows when, yet she swoops in out of nowhere, flashes her rings as though she's showing the world your shackles and... and... GRRAAHHH!" Screams echoed around the park as Asuka yelled towards the heavens, as though she was cursing the gods themselves.  
“她……她要把你从我身边夺走！” 她指的是与绫波发生的事情。“天知道我认识你多久了，她却突然出现，炫耀她的戒指，仿佛在向全世界展示你的枷锁……然后……然后……啊啊啊啊！” 明日香对着天空大喊，仿佛在诅咒众神，公园里回荡着她的尖叫声。

"No!" After breathing heavily for a few moments, she clenched her fists and whirled to face Shinji head-on. Her eyelashes sparkled with moisture as she glared at him. Her gaze was so fierce, he took a step back, cowering slightly.  
“不！”她喘息片刻后，紧握双拳，猛地转身直面真嗣。她的睫毛因湿润而闪烁，目光如炬地瞪着他。那眼神如此凌厉，他不由得后退一步，略显畏缩。

"I'm... sorry" His voice trembled. Realizing that she was probably frightening him, she rolled her eyes and walked over to him.  
"我... 对不起" 他的声音颤抖着。意识到自己可能吓到他了，她翻了个白眼，走过去靠近他。

"I'm not letting her do as she pleases." Asuka looked away, embarrassed as she mumbled. "But with this, I hope you finally understand how I feel. I was hoping for a more romantic confession, but these things are never easy when you're involved."  
"我不会让她随心所欲的。" 明日香别开视线，尴尬地低声说，"但通过这个，我希望你终于能理解我的感受。我本期待一个更浪漫的告白，但只要有你在，这些事从来都不简单。"

It was his turn to feel embarrassed. Looking at his shoes, he suddenly felt an unexplained sense of guilt.  
轮到他感到尴尬了。盯着鞋子的他，突然涌上一股莫名的愧疚感。

"I'm sorry..." "对不起..."

"Argh..." Asuka rolled her eyes again. "If you apologize to me one more time, I'm going to kiss you. And for every time you do it afterwards, I'm going to kiss you again. I don't care if we're in public, at school, or whatever, but I am sick of you saying sorry every five minutes. If this is the only way to shut up your incessant apologies, save using a ball gag, dammit I'll do it!" Asuka's beautiful, cerulean eyes dared him to argue. He was swept away by his pounding heart, and before his brain had any sort of chance to recover, his mouth began moving on its own.  
"啊..." 明日香又翻了个白眼。"如果你再向我道歉一次，我就会吻你。而且每次你这么做之后，我都会再吻你一次。我不在乎我们是在公共场合、在学校还是其他什么地方，但我已经受够了你每隔五分钟就说一次对不起。如果这是唯一能让你停止无休止道歉的方法，除了用口球，该死的我会这么做！" 明日香那双美丽的蔚蓝色眼睛挑衅地看着他。他的心跳如鼓，还没等大脑反应过来，嘴巴已经不由自主地动了起来。

"I'm... sorry?" Meant more as a question to her confounding statement than anything else, he clapped his hand over his mouth. But the damage had already been done.  
"我... 对不起？" 这话更多是对她那令人费解的声明的疑问，而不是别的什么，他赶紧用手捂住嘴。但伤害已经造成了。

Asuka's eyes widened in shock. But it was quickly replaced by a mischievous grin.  
明日香的双眼因震惊而睁大，但很快就被一个调皮的笑容所取代。

"That... was on purpose, wasn't it?"  
“那……是故意的，对吧？”

All he could do was open and close his mouth, gaping like a fish. He felt like his doom was imminent. To whatever gods would listen to his prayer, he wished that he would survive to at least be able to eat some katsu curry, one last time.  
他只能张嘴闭嘴，像条鱼一样呆呆地瞪着。他感觉自己的末日即将来临。向任何愿意聆听他祈祷的神明，他祈愿至少能活到再吃一次炸猪排咖喱饭，哪怕就这一次。

Asuka began to close in slowly, standing on her tiptoes, her grin getting wider and wider as the tip of her nose brushed against the tip of his own. Her arms wrapped around his neck as her face flared with a crimson blush. A fiery determination exploded in her eyes, in which Shinji was now throughly lost in. "Just this once... I'll let it slide." She whispered, her eyes never once leaving his own. One of her hands began to ruffle with his hair as she continued to whisper.  
明日香开始缓缓逼近，踮起脚尖，随着她的鼻尖轻触他的，她的笑容愈发灿烂。她的双臂环抱住他的脖颈，脸上泛起绯红。眼中燃起炽热的决心，此刻的 Shinji 完全迷失其中。“就这一次...我放过你。”她低语，目光始终未曾离开他的双眼。她的一只手开始拨弄他的头发，继续轻声细语。

"Ich liebe dich... dumm Shinji." And with that, her gentle lips pressed against his own, knocking out all of his senses, save for the touch of her lips and the sense of utter euphoria as they stood in the streetlit park, embracing each other to the sound of the chirping cicadas.  
"我爱你...傻真嗣。" 随着这句话，她温柔的唇瓣贴上了他的，剥夺了他所有的感官，只留下唇间的触感和站在街灯下公园里相拥时的极度喜悦，周围是蝉鸣的伴奏。

### Chapter 4: Shinji has a thing for Summoners!  
第四章：真嗣对召唤师情有独钟！  

At some point on the way home, it had started raining. Prepared as usual, Shinji fished out the compact umbrella from his bag. As soon as he had the thing unfolded, Asuka had her arm around his waist, her gaze determinedly looking the other way, for fear of her fire-red face glowing like a beacon in the night being discovered.  
在回家的路上，不知何时开始下起了雨。像往常一样准备周到的真嗣从包里掏出了那把小巧的雨伞。他刚把伞撑开，明日香就挽住了他的腰，目光坚决地望向别处，生怕她那火红的脸颊在夜晚像灯塔一样被人发现。

"Say one embarrassing word or anything and I'll be explaining to Misato why you suddenly have hundreds of bruises." She tried to sound as defensive as possible, but Shinji simply chuckled, beginning the wet but cozy walk home.  
“敢说一句让人尴尬的话或者别的什么，我就会向美里解释为什么你突然浑身是伤。”她试图尽可能地显得防御性强，但真嗣只是轻笑一声，开始了那段湿漉漉但温馨的回家路。

After a few minutes, she had begun to regret her fierce words. Looking at Shinji's arm dangling, she began to wish one of them was wrapped around her shoulders. She leaned in a little closer, attempting to nudge her intentions into him, but his usual obliviousness was preventing her 'Hold me!' signals from reaching his brain.  
几分钟后，她开始后悔自己那番激烈的话语。看着真嗣悬空的手臂，她开始希望其中一只能环抱在她的肩上。她稍稍靠得更近，试图用身体语言向他传达“抱紧我！”的意图，但他的迟钝一如既往，让她发出的信号无法抵达他的大脑。

'I'm beginning to wonder who's the bigger moron...' She thought as she intentionally knocked her hand against his.  
“我开始怀疑谁才是更大的傻瓜...”她心想，故意用手碰了碰他。

Shinji, on the other hand, was facing a dilemma. Her words could be taken seriously, knowing how Asuka used to be in the past. But this new, forward Asuka was a somewhat new creature to him. He had no idea how to react.  
另一方面，真嗣正面临一个难题。考虑到明日香过去的性格，她的言辞可能是认真的。但这个新的、主动的明日香对他来说有些陌生。他完全不知道该如何应对。

A while ago, Hikari had told him something very important.  
不久前，光曾告诉他一件非常重要的事。

"For us girls, and especially a girl like Asuka, who's never really honest about her feelings, never listen to what they're saying. Try to listen to the real words underneath, what they're actually trying to say."  
“对我们女孩来说，尤其是像明日香这样从不真正坦露心声的女孩，别听她们说什么，试着去听她们真正想表达的那些话。”

He'd read enough manga to know that going straight in with that advice was practically suicide. Because it was Asuka, touching her carelessly would result in the offending limb being torn off.  
他读过足够多的漫画，知道直接采纳这个建议几乎等同于自杀。因为那是明日香，鲁莽地触碰她会导致肢体被撕裂。

But if she was already touching him, with her arm wrapped around his waist, holding tight as though to suck all his body warmth from the point of contact, what were the rules then?  
但如果她已经触碰着他，手臂环绕在他的腰间，紧紧抱着仿佛要从接触点吸取他所有的体温，那么规则又是什么呢？

With his umbrella in his right hand, he slowly sneaked his hand around to her shoulder, trembling just above it. The ever perceptive Asuka instantly knew what was going on. Her heartbeat sky-rocketed, not quite believing the normally shy Shinji would try something so daring. With baited breath, she watched him out of the corner of her eye. If she said anything, that fragile courage would be shattered. For the first time in a long time, she had to summon every ounce of patience she could muster.  
他右手撑着伞，慢慢地将手绕到她的肩膀上，手指颤抖着悬停其上。一向敏锐的明日香立刻明白了他的意图。她的心跳加速，几乎不敢相信平时害羞的真嗣会尝试如此大胆的举动。屏住呼吸，她用眼角余光注视着他。如果她开口说些什么，那脆弱的勇气就会破碎。久违地，她必须调动起所有的耐心。

After what seemed like a monumental struggle, she felt his soft touch as he clasped her shoulder gently. A warm smile enveloped her face as she leaned her head into him.  
经过一番似乎是巨大的挣扎后，她感受到了他轻柔的触碰，他温柔地握住了她的肩膀。她脸上绽放出温暖的微笑，将头靠向了他。

"I'm not that scary, am I?"  
"我没那么吓人，对吧？"

Shinji grinned as he held her tighter.  
真嗣笑着将她抱得更紧。

"Not anymore." "现在不吓人了。"

Standing outside the Katsuragi residence, the time had come for them to finally let go. Reluctantly, the two separated and rode the elevator to their floor. Suddenly, they were standing outside their front door.  
站在葛城家的门外，终于到了他们不得不放手的时候。依依不舍地，两人分开并乘坐电梯回到了各自的楼层。突然间，他们就站在了自己的家门口。

Taking a deep breath, Asuka gathered her thoughts. Starting today, she was living with Rei Ayanami. She was living with a potential rival in love. She had to be prepared for anything.  
深吸一口气，明日香整理思绪。从今天起，她将与绫波零同住一个屋檐下。她将与一个潜在的情敌共处一室。她必须做好万全准备。

As she opened her eyes, the front door had begun sliding open. In a heartbeat, a slim, pale white arm had reached out and dragged Shinji inside, screaming. The door slammed shut, audibly locking.  
当她睁开眼睛时，前门已经开始滑动打开。转眼间，一只纤细苍白的手臂伸了出来，将真嗣拖进门内，尖叫声随之响起。门砰然关闭，清晰地锁上了。

Asuka took another deep breath, this time attempting to quell the volcano of rage broiling inside her. A quick analysis of the situation told her one thing. Her romantic interest was now locked in a house with a prospective fiancée, who according to the various noises, was probably molesting him. The volcano erupted as she rammed the door with all her might, attempting to break it down. But as strong as her rage was, she wasn't quite physically strong enough to break down the door.  
明日香又深吸了一口气，这次试图平息内心翻腾的怒火。对局势的快速分析告诉她一件事。她心仪的人现在与一位潜在的未婚妻锁在屋内，根据各种声响，对方很可能正在侵犯他。怒火如火山爆发般喷涌而出，她用尽全力撞向门，试图将其撞开。尽管她的愤怒如此强烈，但她的身体力量却不足以破门而入。

"Open this fucking door Ayanami!"  
“绫波，给我他妈的开门！”

Her response was more of Shinji's wailing, serving to fuel her rage even further. She punched the door, kicked it, shoulder-barged it and screamed at it. Resting her head against its metal frame, she began thinking frantically.  
回应她的是真嗣更加凄厉的哭喊，这进一步点燃了她的怒火。她拳打脚踢，用肩膀猛撞，对着门尖叫。将头靠在金属门框上，她开始疯狂地思考对策。

"Come on genius. How can we get in there?!" More sounds of struggling could be heard and Shinji's startled voice echoed from what sounded like the middle room.  
“快点，天才。我们怎么进去？！”更多的挣扎声传来，真嗣惊慌的声音从听起来像是中间的房间里回荡。

"Rei?! That's my belt, put it back!"  
“绫波？！那是我的腰带，放回去！”

Asuka's eyes sparkled with reignited fury, a million degrees hotter than before. Her only thought was saving Shinji as she brought her fist up again, preparing to hit the door as hard as she could.  
明日香的眼睛闪烁着重新燃起的怒火，比之前还要炽热千万度。她唯一的念头就是救出真嗣，于是再次举起拳头，准备尽全力猛击门。

"GET YOUR HANDS OFF MY SHINJI!" The bracelet sparkled a furious red, as bright as her fury. Her fist connected with the door. Unnoticed in her rage, her arm had covered itself with a bright red metallic armour, which she used to smash the door off the frame of the wall. Debris and dust exploded everywhere. When the dust settled, a terrifying image of Asuka faded into view.  
“放开我的真嗣！”手镯闪烁着愤怒的红色，如同她心中的怒火一般炽烈。她的拳头击中了门。在她狂怒之中，未被察觉的是，她的手臂已经覆盖上了一层鲜红的金属盔甲，她用它将门从墙框中砸飞。碎片和尘埃四处飞溅。尘埃落定后，一个令人恐惧的明日香的身影逐渐显现。

On the floor of the living room, a petrified looking Shinji was caught underneath Rei, who was in the middle of removing his shirt.  
在客厅的地板上，一脸惊恐的真嗣被丽压在身下，她正在脱他的衬衫。

"Katsuragi-sensei will not be too happy with that."  
“葛城老师不会对此太高兴的。”

"I don't give a flying fuck about the damn door right now." Asuka snarled. Rei looked back with an emotionless stare, and finally let go of Shinji, who looked close to passing out.  
"我现在根本不在乎那该死的门。" 明日香咆哮道。绫波回头，用毫无感情的目光看着她，最终放开了快晕过去的真嗣。

"So it appears the experiment was a success." Her eyes glanced towards Asuka's arm, still covered in the almost feral armour. Following her eyes, Asuka too noticed the strange development with her arm, and her anger was suddenly replaced with surprise and curiosity.  
"看来实验成功了。" 她的目光瞥向明日香仍覆盖着近乎野性盔甲的手臂。顺着她的视线，明日香也注意到了自己手臂的奇怪变化，愤怒突然被惊讶和好奇所取代。

"Wait, what? What is this thing?!"  
“等等，什么？这是什么东西？！”

"Moreover, it's just like you to conjure something so beastly in appearance." Rei said as she held out her own arm. A similar looking bracelet to the ones Shinji and Asuka wore adorned her arm, except it was a perfect white colour. Closing her eyes, Rei went silent. After a moment, a similar armour appeared on her arm, in similar fashion to Asuka's. It looked a lot less scary than Asuka's arm, with a more elegant touch to its appearance.  
"再者，你能召唤出如此狰狞之物，倒也符合你的风格。" 丽说着伸出自己的手臂。她的手腕上戴着与真嗣和明日香相似的手镯，只是颜色纯白无瑕。闭上眼睛，丽静默片刻。随即，她的手臂上也浮现出类似的装甲，与明日香的装甲形成方式相似。不过，她的装甲看起来远不如明日香的那样吓人，外观上更显优雅。

"And what are you going to do with that?" Bringing her own weaponised arm into a fighting stance, Asuka prepared, come whatever madness may. Rei completely ignored her however, and turned towards Shinji.  
"你打算用那东西做什么？" 明日香将自己的武器化手臂摆出战斗姿态，准备迎接任何疯狂的挑战。然而，丽完全无视了她，转向真嗣。

"My ones prettier, don't you think?"  
"我的更漂亮，你不觉得吗？"

Shinji could only look between the two girls, dumbfounded. Was it a serious question? Was there going to be repurcussions if he said he did indeed think Rei's arm-armour thing was a little less scary than Asuka's? Probably, but he was thankfully saved from asking by the sound of a heavy six-pack of Yebisu dropping to the ground. The owner of the beer was currently looking at her front door, aghast.  
真嗣只能呆呆地看着两位女孩，不知所措。这是个严肃的问题吗？如果他承认确实觉得绫波的臂甲比明日香的要稍微不那么吓人，会有什么后果吗？很可能会有，但幸运的是，一阵沉重的六罐装惠比寿啤酒落地声救了他。啤酒的主人此刻正惊愕地盯着自家前门。

"Does someone want to explain what happened here?" Misato eyed the three students, as well as the peculiar weapons attached to the girl's arms.  
“有人能解释一下这里发生了什么吗？”美里打量着这三名学生，以及那个女孩手臂上奇特的武器。

"We were just...-" Her excuses tumbled over each other inside her mouth, but before Asuka could get a decent word out, Rei spoke up.  
"我们只是...-" 她的借口在嘴里争先恐后地涌出，但还没等明日香能说出一句完整的话，绫波便开口了。

"I was instructed by Yui Ikari to perform an experiment involving the bracelets. And before anything else, I believe it's my duty to clean up the mess of my... Subjects." Something like a smile curled across Rei's lips as she reformed her armour back into a bracelet. Holding her arm out again, she closed her eyes. Sparks and mystical lights began to flow around the room as the debris from the earlier incident began to lift and return to the wall. It was like watching an explosion happening in reverse.  
"我受碇唯的指示，进行了一项关于手镯的实验。而在此之前，我认为我有责任清理我...实验对象造成的混乱。" 绫波的嘴角勾起一丝类似微笑的表情，随后将她的装甲重新变回手镯。她再次伸出胳膊，闭上眼睛。火花和神秘的光芒开始在房间内流动，之前事故产生的碎片开始升起并回归到墙面上。这就像是在观看一场反向的爆炸。

Asuka watched the spectacle relieved that her outburst hadn't caused any permanent damage, but couldn't help feel a little antagonistic towards Rei. The girl had been playing them both the second they'd returned home. How was she expected to live with a girl who was clearly going to mess with her head.  
明日香看着这一幕，松了一口气，庆幸自己的爆发没有造成永久性损害，但忍不住对绫波产生了一丝敌意。从他们回家的那一刻起，这个女孩就在玩弄他们俩。她怎么能指望和一个显然会扰乱她思绪的女孩共处一室。

"An experiment?" Shinji suddenly remembered how to use his voice. "Are you going to show us how to actually use this things? And wait, how are you involved with my parents?"  
"一个实验？" 真嗣突然记起如何使用自己的声音。"你要教我们如何实际使用这些东西吗？等等，你和我父母有什么关系？"

"Actually, I can answer that one." After placing her slightly dented beers in the refrigerator, taking one out for herself, she sat down on the sofa.  
"实际上，我可以回答这个问题。" 她将稍稍凹陷的啤酒放入冰箱，取出一罐给自己，然后坐在沙发上。"

"Was it about a week ago? Something like that-" One quick swig of beer and then she continued. "So about a week ago, Yui came up to me and said, 'Misato', in that voice that tells me she's going to ask for something huge. Anyway, 'Misato, would you be able to do me a huge favour, and take care of one of my distant relatives for a while?'. Of course, along with Kyoko, we're sort of all in this together, so I can't exactly refuse her."  
"大约一周前？差不多那样——" 她迅速喝了一口啤酒，然后继续说道。"所以大约一周前，Yui 来找我，用那种让我知道她要提出大请求的语气说，'Misato'。总之，'Misato，你能帮我一个大忙，暂时照顾一下我的一个远房亲戚吗？'。当然，和 Kyoko 一起，我们算是共同承担这一切，所以我不能拒绝她。"

At the mention of her mother, Asuka perked up. It wasn't often she got to hear of her ever-busy parent, but as much as she would never admit it, she was a mommy's girl and wanted to spend more time with her. As a result of this deity-creating experiment, the Ikari's and her mother had spent so much time locked in their labs that she was begin to seriously worry about her mothers health. She was never really the type to take care of herself, and seemed to be constantly bumping into things. For all she knew, her ditzy mother probably forgot how to sleep.  
一提到母亲，明日香顿时来了精神。她很少有机会听到这位总是忙碌的家长的消息，尽管她绝不会承认，但她确实是个离不开妈妈的孩子，渴望与母亲共度更多时光。由于这项创造神明的实验，碇家和她的母亲长时间被困在实验室里，这让明日香开始严重担忧母亲的健康。母亲向来不擅长照顾自己，总是磕磕碰碰的。在明日香看来，她那迷糊的母亲可能连睡觉都忘了怎么睡。

"Wait, we're related?" Shinji asked curiously. He had met Rei as a child, and they had played together a lot as children, but leaving talks of marriage aside, this was the first he had heard of a blood relation. He'd always assumed her parents were business partners to his parents or something.  
“等等，我们是亲戚？” 真嗣好奇地问道。他小时候就认识丽，两人童年时经常一起玩耍，但抛开婚姻话题不谈，这是他第一次听说有血缘关系。他一直以为她的父母和自己的父母是生意伙伴之类的关系。

"Even I'm not really sure of the relationship, but something like very distant cousins?" Rei sounded just as curious as he was. Misato grinned at the pair of them.  
"连我自己也不太确定这关系，但大概是远得不能再远的远房表亲吧？" 丽的声音里同样充满了好奇。美里对着他们俩咧嘴一笑。

"Nothing to worry about, a marriage between the two of you would be perfectly okay. Well, apart from the childhood friend having her say." She knocked back her head and laughed, downing the rest of her beer.  
“没什么好担心的，你们俩结婚完全没问题。不过嘛，青梅竹马总得发表点意见。”她仰头大笑，一口气喝完了剩下的啤酒。

"Which isn't happening by the way." Asuka growled. Her lack of a say in this marriage arrangement was infuriating, but she'd be damned if she was going to let any of it go ahead.  
"反正这事儿没戏。" 明日香咆哮道。她在这桩婚事中毫无发言权，这让她怒不可遏，但她绝不会让这一切继续下去。

"Are we declaring war?" Misato teased. The Asuka she knew was stubborn and wasn't about to place herself into a situation that may potentially embarrass her. But her jaw hung itself open as she watched the spirited yet flushed redhead link arms with Shinji, who looked close to having his own personal meltdown, and force herself to present a victorious grin.  
"我们这是要宣战吗？" 美里打趣道。她认识的明日香固执得很，绝不会让自己陷入可能尴尬的境地。但当她看到那位精神抖擞却满脸通红的红发少女挽着真嗣的胳膊，强迫自己露出胜利的微笑时，她的下巴几乎要掉下来了。真嗣看起来快要崩溃了。

"If she's come to challenge my territory that I've had claimed for over ten years, she can forget it." She looked up to the boy she had known her entire life, his eyes as wide as peaches.  
"如果她是来挑战我十多年来一直占据的领地，那她还是趁早死心吧。" 她抬头看向那个她从小到大一直认识的男孩，他的眼睛瞪得像桃子一样大。

"He's mine." “他是我的。”

In a flash, Rei was hanging off his other arm, glaring at her competition. Stuck in the middle, Shinji suddenly thought of all the things he still had to do in life. With the way things were going, he was never going to get laid before Asuka killed him. He had been thinking of trying his hand at becoming a mangaka, but his characters and ideas were tearfully waving goodbye to him as the grim reaper came to introduce himself. He should've wrote a will at some point...  
转眼间，丽已经挂在他的另一只手臂上，瞪着她的竞争对手。被困在中间的 Shinji 突然想起了生活中还有许多事情要做。照这样下去，他还没来得及和 Asuka 发生关系就会被她杀掉。他曾考虑过尝试成为一名漫画家，但他的角色和创意正泪流满面地向他挥手告别，死神则前来自我介绍。他本该在某一刻写下遗嘱的……

"This little drama is great to watch and all, definitely beats anything on TV these days, but can we pause this and resume that conversation about 'experiments' and freaky bracelets?" The rarely seen responsible Misato made her appearance, with the best intentions.  
“这场小闹剧真是好看，绝对比现在的电视节目强多了，但我们能不能暂停一下，继续谈谈关于‘实验’和那些奇怪的手环的话题？”难得一见的负责任的 Misato 出现了，带着最好的意图。

But Rei had other ideas.  
但丽有别的打算。

"This might be a good idea to show what I've learned."  
"这或许是个展示我所学的好机会。"

Her bracelet glowed once more. A length of thin, sturdy rope was conjured out of thin air. It rapidly wrapped itself around Shinji, pinning his arms to his side. Another rope did the same to Asuka, although her arms were restrained behind her, preventing her from moving.  
她的手镯再次发光。一条细长而结实的绳索凭空出现，迅速缠绕住真嗣，将他的双臂紧贴身体束缚住。另一条绳索同样缠住了明日香，但她的手臂被反绑在背后，使她无法动弹。

"If you can't use the weapons available, you won't be able to win this battle." Rei said, a victorious smile playing across her face.  
""如果你不能利用现有的武器，你就无法赢得这场战斗。"" 丽说道，脸上浮现出一丝胜利的微笑。

"I'm too young for BDSM, can't we just talk about this Rei?!" Shinji wailed in the middle. Asuka was struggling against the rope digging into her arms, infuriated from the brazenness shown by the red-eyed man-thief. She was still surprised at how real the ropes felt, for something that was essentially created from nothing.  
"我还没到能接受 BDSM 的年纪啊，就不能和丽好好谈谈吗？！" 真嗣在中间哀嚎道。明日香挣扎着，绳子勒进她的手臂，对那个红眼男贼的厚颜无耻感到愤怒。她仍然惊讶于这些绳索的真实感，毕竟它们本质上是从无到有创造出来的。

"I thought the whole reason you were here was to show us how to use these damn bracelets?!" Her mind raced as she tried to remember how the technology worked.  
“我以为你来这儿的目的就是教我们怎么用这些该死的手环？！”她的大脑飞速运转，试图回忆这项技术是如何运作的。

Breaking down the door, she had wanted something strong, something that could compensate for her lack of strength. It didn't even matter what shape, but it morphed into a powerful arm. Her subconscious might've filled in the blanks, but she essentially imagined something strong. Just like in the room in the lab, Shinji had to imagine the cat into existence. With that in mind...  
她破门而入时，渴望得到某种强大的力量，以弥补自身的不足。形状并不重要，但它最终化作了一条强有力的手臂。或许是潜意识填补了空白，但她本质上想象的是某种强大的东西。正如在实验室的那个房间里，真嗣不得不将猫想象成现实一样。想到这里……

"Heh..." An evil grin played on her face.  
“嘿嘿……”她的脸上浮现出一抹邪恶的笑容。

"I don't like that face your making Asuka... " Shinji knew her various expressions well enough by now to know that her counterattack was imminent and would somehow be painful for him.  
“我不喜欢你现在的表情，明日香……”真嗣已经很熟悉她的各种表情，知道她的反击即将到来，而且肯定会让他痛苦不堪。

"It appears you weren't necessary after all Ayanami." Straining her muscles, stretching the rope, and eventually the rope restraining Asuka came free. Part of the rope tying her hands had been charred black as she had burned through them by imagining flame surrounding her hands. The power even ensured she hadn't felt the burn of the flame either.  
"看来你终究不是必需的，绫波。" 她用力绷紧肌肉，拉扯着绳索，最终束缚着明日香的绳子松脱了。绑住她双手的部分绳索已被烧得焦黑，因为她想象着火焰环绕双手，竟真的将其烧断了。这股力量甚至让她连火焰的灼烧感都未曾感受到。

"You just need an open mind."  
"你只需要一个开放的心态。"

"Oh I see!" It looked like Shinji had come to the same conclusion. Closing his eyes, he imagined a flame burning the ropes at the contact point of his body. Within seconds, and accompanied by a whooshing flame sound, the ropes fell to his feet, severed and charred.  
"哦，我明白了！" 看起来真嗣得出了同样的结论。他闭上眼睛，想象着一团火焰在身体与绳索接触点燃烧。几秒钟内，伴随着呼啸的火焰声，绳索断开并烧焦，掉落在他的脚边。

"Ow!" He'd apparently forgotten that fire burns though, neglecting to protect himself as Asuka had done.  
"哎哟！" 他显然忘记了火会烧伤，没有像明日香那样保护自己。

"Instead of explaining everything, it's easier to show you. And it will be easier to remember in the future too." Rei made no move to suggest any further antagonistic moves would follow.  
"与其解释一切，不如直接展示给你看。这样将来也更容易记住。" 丽没有做出任何暗示会有进一步敌对行动的举动。

"Teaching like a normal person isn't bad once in a while though."  
"偶尔像普通人那样教学也不错。"

"I agree with him. You better not become a schoolteacher someday, you might end up killing someone." Asuka sighed. But now she knew how the bracelet worked, she wanted to try something out. Holding out her hand, she closed her eyes and began to exercise her imagination.  
我同意他的看法。你最好别当老师，哪天说不定真会闹出人命。明日香叹了口气。但现在她已经明白了手环的运作原理，便想亲自试试。她伸出手，闭上双眼，开始运用自己的想象力。

Within a few moments, a bottle of Ramane appeared.  
没过一会儿，一瓶拉玛内酒就出现了。

"Oh sweet, things like this can be summoned too!" She popped off the top and began to drink. It tasted the same as any other she had drunk in the past.  
“哦，太好了，这种东西也能召唤出来！”她打开瓶盖开始喝了起来。味道和她以前喝过的任何一种都一样。

"Does that count as stealing?" Shinji looked sheepishly at her as she finished the whole bottle off.  
"那算不算偷窃呢？" 真嗣有些尴尬地看着她，她已经把整瓶酒喝完了。

"Does this mean I never have to buy beer anymore?!" Misato jumped up excitedly. She sat down despondently when Rei began to shake her head.  
"这是不是意味着我以后再也不用买啤酒了？！" 美里兴奋地跳了起来。当丽开始摇头时，她又沮丧地坐了下来。

"There's still a lot we don't know yet, but because beer is something we haven't tried yet, we wouldn't be able to summon something we don't know the taste of. There's no record of it in our subconscious memory."  
"我们还有很多未知的东西，但因为啤酒是我们还没尝试过的，我们无法召唤出我们不知道味道的东西。在我们的潜意识记忆中没有它的记录。"

"Asuka, I'm willing to turn a blind eye as a teacher and a legal guardian this once, you can have one of my Yebisu, so please-..." Misato stopped short when she noticed Asuka was already holding a can of Yebisu. There was no trace of guilt in her face, not in the slightest. If anything, a sly smile was shining through.  
"明日香，作为老师和法定监护人，我这次可以睁一只眼闭一只眼，你可以拿一罐我的惠比寿啤酒，所以请——..."美里话说到一半突然停住，因为她注意到明日香手里已经拿着一罐惠比寿。她的脸上没有丝毫的愧疚，反而露出了一丝狡黠的笑容。

"Asuka, we're minors..." Shinji sighed again. He felt like he'd be doing it a lot more in the future to come.  
"明日香，我们还是未成年人..."真嗣再次叹了口气。他感觉未来这样的叹息会越来越多。

"Try telling that to my mom. She takes a very German approach to these things." Asuka chuckled as she threw the beer to Misato.  
"你跟我妈说去吧。她对这些事情采取的是非常德国式的态度。"明日香笑着把啤酒扔给了美里。

"It's even got the right temperature! It's ice cold!" Instantly popping the tab, Misato's grin looked ready to jump off her face. "Don't mind if I do!"  
“温度也刚刚好！冰凉冰凉的！”美里立刻拉开拉环，笑容仿佛要从脸上蹦出来。“那我就不客气了！”

"You're not going to even try to correct all the wrong in this situation?" Shinji mumbled as he watched Misato down the beer in one go.  
“你甚至不打算尝试纠正这种情况中的所有错误吗？”真嗣咕哝着，看着美里一口气喝完啤酒。

"Why? If I do that, I might stop getting free beer! And nothing in life tastes better than free beer!"  
"为什么？如果我那样做，我可能就喝不到免费啤酒了！生活中没有什么比免费啤酒更美味的了！"

Shaking his head, Shinji thought to his own bracelet. If it worked by exercising his imagination, he wanted to try it with something that didn't exist in the real world. Holding out his hand, he mimicked Asuka's earlier actions and closed his eyes. He focuses hard, and within seconds, felt a heavy object in his hand.  
摇了摇头，真嗣想到了自己的手环。如果它是通过发挥想象力来运作的，他想尝试一下现实中不存在的东西。他伸出手，模仿明日香之前的动作，闭上眼睛。他集中精神，几秒钟内，就感觉到手中有一个沉重的物体。

"Someone's been playing too much Final Fantasy lately."  
"最近有人玩太多《最终幻想》了。"

An oddly shaped watery-blue sword was in his hands. It looked identical to the one he had been using in the game he had been playing with Asuka a few days before they had gone to the lab.  
他手中握着一把形状奇特的水蓝色长剑。它看起来与他几天前和明日香一起玩游戏时所用的那把一模一样，就在他们去实验室之前。

"You were playing it with me!"  
"你刚才是在和我一起玩！"

"That's true." In Asuka's hands was a long staff with a blue handle, with a golden head that incorporated an interesting design. "Woah... If I did any cosplay, this would save so much money on the outfits!"  
"确实如此。" 在明日香手中的是一根长杖，蓝色手柄，金色头部带有独特的设计。"哇...如果我做角色扮演，这能省下不少服装费呢！"

"You have the power of imagination at your disposal and you're using it for... Cosplay?" Rei sounded out her disbelief.  
"你拥有想象的力量，却用它来做...角色扮演？" 丽表达出她的不相信。

"Oh come on! Haven't you ever wanted to be like your favourite character from a story or something? This is awesome!" Asuka glanced at Shinji. "Let's go the whole way!"  
“哎呀，拜托！你难道没想过要像你最喜欢的故事角色那样吗？这太棒了！”明日香瞥了真嗣一眼。“我们全力以赴吧！”

Asuka's whole body was quickly enveloped in red light. After a few moments, she was wearing a kimono-esque outfit, a blue flowing dress with a backless white design covering her top-half. Just like...  
明日香全身迅速被红光笼罩。片刻之后，她换上了一套和服风格的衣服，蓝色飘逸的长裙搭配上半身无袖的白色设计。简直就像……

"Yuna! You look just like her!" Shinji could only stare at the immaculately detailed recreation of his arguably favourite character from the game series. Something that he suspected she had done on purpose.  
“优娜！你看起来和她一模一样！”真嗣只能盯着这个他心目中可以说是游戏系列里最喜欢的角色，如此细致入微的再现。他怀疑这是她故意为之的。

"It appears I'm going to have to start playing more games with you Shinji." Rei smiled at him. Asuka smirked whilst pointing the staff at her.  
“看来我得开始多和你一起玩游戏了，真嗣。”绫波微笑着对他说。明日香则一边得意地笑着，一边用权杖指向她。

"That's right, I know all of Shinji's favourite characters, his likes, dislikes and what buttons to press with him. You're not stealing him away, no matter what you do!"  
“没错，我知道真嗣最喜欢的角色，他的喜好、厌恶以及如何与他相处。无论你做什么，都别想把他从我身边抢走！”

Rei returned the smirk, folding her arms and taking a defiant posture.  
丽回以一丝冷笑，双臂交叉，摆出一副挑衅的姿态。

"We shall see." 「我们拭目以待。」

### Chapter 5: You Can (Not) Run Away  
第五章：你无法逃离  

_I'd advise listening to In the Hall of the Mountain King_ by Grieg _whilst reading the first scene. At least, that's what I was listening to when I wrote it xD_  
我建议在阅读第一幕时听格里格的《山魔王的宫殿》。至少，这是我写作时听的曲子 xD

---

Morning had made itself known, shining blinding rays of light into a tiny sliver of a gap between Shinji's curtains. Through the magic of physics and reflections, that minuscule beam of sunlight had bounced off the metallic parts on his music player, and had somehow found a path straight onto Shinji's closed eyelids. Grimacing in response to the assault on his eyes, he gingerly opened an eye, wondering why his arms felt so heavy.  
清晨已悄然来临，将刺眼的光线射入真嗣窗帘间的一丝缝隙。借助物理学和反射的魔力，那一小束阳光从他的音乐播放器的金属部件上弹开，不知怎的竟直接找到了通往真嗣紧闭眼睑的路径。他因眼睛受到的攻击而皱起眉头，小心翼翼地睁开一只眼，疑惑为何手臂感觉如此沉重。

Never in his entire life had he regretted waking up more than today.  
他一生中从未像今天这样后悔过醒来。

On his left slept a familiar head of bright, dazzling orange. On his right, a cool, yet enticing head of blue. Asuka and Rei were both asleep in his bed, each reserving an arm for a pillow.  
左边躺着一个熟悉的、耀眼的橙色脑袋。右边则是一个冷静而诱人的蓝色脑袋。明日香和绫波零都睡在他的床上，各自枕着他的一条胳膊。

And as if that wasn't enough to give him the shock of a lifetime, the alarm clock close to his bed told him he had about thirty seconds before it was due to go off.  
而似乎这还不足以让他震惊一生，床边的闹钟告诉他，再过三十秒就要响了。

Thirty seconds before complete and utter, absolute hell would undoubtedly tear apart his existence like a hurricane, and make the Armageddon look like a cake walk.  
再过三十秒，绝对的、彻底的地狱无疑会像飓风一样撕裂他的存在，让世界末日看起来都像是在散步。

Actually no, it was twenty seconds now. Twenty seconds before a portal to hell opened in his room.  
实际上不，现在只剩二十秒了。二十秒后，通往地狱的传送门将在他的房间打开。

Needless to say, he had started to sweat buckets. He could fill a decently sized swimming pool with his overdriven anxiety sweat. And all that did was serve to add to his panic, wondering if the two girls would be grossed out.  
不用说，他已经开始大汗淋漓。他的过度焦虑汗水足以填满一个相当大的游泳池。而这只会加剧他的恐慌，担心那两个女孩会不会觉得恶心。

Ten seconds. 十秒钟。

He still never got around to writing that will. And he had never really got started with his bucket list either. At this rate he would never write that perverted manga he had been planning on since way back.  
他还是没来得及写那份遗嘱。而且他的遗愿清单也从未真正开始过。照这样下去，他永远也写不出那部从很久以前就开始策划的色情漫画了。

To begin with, what were they doing in his room? Were their own rooms not good enough? Was his bed comfier than theirs? Why?  
首先，他们为什么会在他的房间里？难道他们自己的房间不够好吗？是他的床比他们的更舒服吗？为什么？

Five seconds. 五秒钟。

"Oh god please no..." “哦天哪，请不要……”

Two seconds. 两秒钟。

"God's not in his heaven, he's gone off somewhere and abandoned me. AGAIN."  
"上帝不在他的天堂，他又跑到哪儿去了，又一次抛弃了我。"

One second. 稍等一下。

"AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH..."  
"啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊..."

As he mentally screamed his way into denial, the inevitable dindindindin of his alarm clock began to beep, and he felt Asuka nudge on his arm.  
当他内心尖叫着陷入否认时，不可避免的闹钟“叮叮叮叮”声开始响起，他感觉到明日香轻推他的手臂。

"Shinji... Please, five more minutes, come on... Who the hell has their alarm on this early in the morning..."  
“真嗣...拜托，再睡五分钟，行行好...谁会在这么早的早晨设闹钟啊...”

"I agree Ikari. Your alarm is set ridiculously early."  
“我同意，碇。你的闹钟设得也太早了。”

An awkward silence descended upon the room, penetrated by the still beeping alarm clock.  
房间里笼罩着尴尬的沉默，只有仍在嘀嗒作响的闹钟声穿透其中。

"Rei." "丽。"

"Yes, Asuka?" "什么事，明日香？"

"Why are you in Shinji's bed?"  
“你为什么在真嗣的床上？”

"I believe for the same reasons you are also in his bed."  
“我想我和你一样，都是因为同样的原因才在他的床上。”

Another awkward silence. The alarm clock was still beeping. It was doing that thing alarm clocks do, speeding up the beeps, as well as upping its volume.  
又是一阵尴尬的沉默。闹钟还在响个不停。它正做着闹钟常做的事，加快响声的频率，同时提高音量。

But all Shinji could hear was the sound of his own heartbeat, racing a marathon at a deafening pace. He was sure his own nervous system was trying to give itself a heart attack.  
但真嗣只能听到自己心跳的声音，以震耳欲聋的速度跑着马拉松。他确信自己的神经系统正试图给自己一个心脏病发作。

"Shinji." “真嗣。”

"I swear, this is not my-..."  
“我发誓，这不是我的……”

"Why did you let that harlot into your bed."  
"你为何让那荡妇上了你的床。"

"...fault." "...过错。"

"I take offence at being called a 'harlot'. Wench."  
"我可不乐意被称作‘荡妇’。泼妇。"

"OH NO YOU DIDN'T!" Asuka leapt out of Shinji's bed, grabbing the screeching alarm clock, then proceeding to throw it as hard as she could towards Rei.  
“你敢！”明日香从真嗣的床上跳起来，抓起那只尖叫的闹钟，用力朝绫波扔去。

Lifting her arm faster than anyone could have seen, Rei's bracelet sparkled with a shimmering light. A shield, or something like a forcefield had bubbled around Shinji and herself. The alarm clock collided with the shield at high speed, exploding into a flurry of plastic shards and silicon chips. The poor thing had never stood a chance.  
绫波手臂一挥，快得无人能看清，她的手镯闪烁着微光。一个盾牌，或者说类似力场的东西在真嗣和她周围形成。闹钟高速撞上力场，瞬间炸成一片塑料碎片和硅芯片。那可怜的小东西根本毫无胜算。

"THEY'RE GONNA KILL ME!" Shinji screamed as he barrelled out of his room, bright lights and explosions following in his wake. His doorframe blew up into a cloud of dust, smoke rushing down the hallways.  
“他们要杀了我！”真嗣尖叫着冲出房间，身后是明亮的灯光和爆炸。他的门框炸成一团尘埃，烟雾沿着走廊蔓延。

"YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED IN HERE!" Asuka bellowed as her bracelet morphed into a katana, of which the blade was on fire.  
“你不能进来这里！”明日香吼道，她的手镯变形为一把武士刀，刀刃上燃烧着火焰。

"And I suppose Ikari gave you permission to sneak into his bed?" Rei's response was met with a sharp blade to the throat, sparks flying off the bubble shield still around her. Summoning her own weapons, Rei had opted for a pair of gauntlets on her arms, equipped with a gun and live ammunition.  
“我猜是碇让你偷偷爬上他的床的？”绫波的回应伴随着一把锋利的刀刃抵在她的喉咙上，火花从她周围依然存在的泡泡护盾上飞溅而出。绫波召唤出自己的武器，选择了一对装有枪和实弹的手套。

Asuka had thrown up her own shield, and the bullets were ricocheting around the apartment. Several of which buried themselves into the walls around Shinji, who had remembered just in time how to use his own bracelet, allowing him to generate his own shield. He looked just about ready to wet himself, cowering in fear on the floor as he stared at the war going on in the living room.  
明日香也举起了自己的护盾，子弹在公寓内四处弹射。其中几颗嵌入了真嗣周围的墙壁，他及时想起了如何使用自己的手镯，生成了自己的护盾。他看起来几乎要吓尿了，蜷缩在地上，惊恐地盯着客厅里正在进行的战斗。

"THAT. IS. ENOUGH." "够了！"

Another explosion rocked the apartment. A rarely seen, royally pissed Misato had jumped into the midst of the girl's fighting, pointing her own weapons at the two battling females. An eloquently designed flintlock pistol and a traditional wakizashi sword that was parrying Asuka's flaming katana, which itself was slowly beginning to fade out of view, along with Rei's gauntlets. Their bracelets had mysteriously decided to power off. Glimmering on Misato's arm was a purple bracelet, matching perfectly with her hair.  
又一声爆炸震撼了公寓。极少见到的、怒气冲天的美里跳进了女孩们的战斗中，用她自己的武器指向两位正在交战的女性。一把设计精美的燧发枪和一把传统的胁差，正抵挡着明日香燃烧的武士刀，那刀本身正慢慢开始消失，连同丽的手套一起。她们的腕带神秘地决定关闭电源。美里手臂上闪烁着一条紫色的腕带，与她的头发完美匹配。

If she hadn't been in her regular vest top and short shorts, Shinji would have felt that she looked incredibly cool right then.  
如果不是她穿着平常的背心和短裤，真嗣会觉得她此刻看起来非常酷。

"W-what happened?" Asuka looked surprised as she checked her bracelet. A holographic message had appeared above it.  
"发-发生了什么？" 明日香惊讶地检查着她的手环。一个全息信息出现在它上方。

Administrator lockout. 管理员锁定。

"Your bracelets are not toys! You both could have easily killed someone!" Misato stood up, glaring at the two girls as she lowered her weapons. It was really weird to see her acting responsible, and for once looking genuinely angry. It was almost scary.  
"你们的手环不是玩具！你们俩本可以轻易杀死某人的！" 美里站起身来，瞪着两个女孩，同时收起了武器。看到她表现得如此负责任，而且这次真的看起来很生气，这几乎有点吓人。

"Wait, why do you have one?" Asuka looked at the similar bracelet Misato now wore on her left arm. Smiling, Misato held it out proudly.  
“等等，你怎么也有一个？”明日香看着美里左臂上与自己相似的手环。美里微笑着，自豪地展示出来。

"Yui gave me one. She needed to make sure that you guys wouldn't mess around and abuse your newfound 'powers', so she made me one with administrative technology so that I can remotely shut down your bracelets if things ever get out of hand." Glancing around the remains of what she once called her home, Misato sighed.  
"优给了我一个。她需要确保你们不会胡闹，滥用新获得的'能力'，所以她用管理技术给我做了一个，这样我就能在情况失控时远程关闭你们的手环。" 米莎托环顾着曾经称之为家的废墟，叹了口气。

"I'd say this pretty much sums up what she was talking about."  
"我想这基本上概括了她所说的内容。"

The girls and Shinji together worked on repairing the damage that had been caused. Together with the bracelets, after Misato had re-enabled them, it wasn't a difficult job. Soon enough the apartment looked spotless. It was as though there had never been a fight at all, save for the trauma Shinji and the majority of their neighbours probably received.  
女孩们和真嗣一起修复了造成的损坏。在美里重新启用手环后，这项工作并不困难。不久，公寓看起来一尘不染。仿佛从未发生过任何战斗，除了真嗣和大多数邻居可能遭受的心理创伤。

"So with that out of the way, I think its time to lay down some house rules with these gadgets." Misato was sat in a chair, a summoned Yebisu cracked open in her hand.  
"既然问题解决了，我想是时候为这些小玩意儿制定一些家规了。" 美里坐在椅子上，手中拿着一瓶召唤来的 Yebisu 啤酒。

"No violence in the house. At all. Yui has given me strict orders that the bracelets cannot be used for settling disputes of any kind with force."  
"家中禁止任何形式的暴力。Yui 严格命令过，这些手环不能用于以武力解决任何争端。"

Misato downed another gulp of her beer before continuing.  
美里又猛灌了一口啤酒，然后继续说道。

"You all wield powers that most would attribute to a deity. You're basically three out-of-control gods at the moment. Think about that for a second, and I hope you'll realise how dangerous this power actually is."  
"你们所掌握的力量，常人会将其归于神明。你们现在基本上就是三个失控的神。稍微想想这一点，我希望你们能意识到这种力量实际上有多危险。"

Asuka, Rei and Shinji all nodded together, all feeling a little ashamed of what had occurred.  
明日香、绫波和真嗣都一起点了点头，对于发生的事情感到有些羞愧。

"The only other rule would be to not abuse the powers in a way that would break the law. Can't have you three becoming phantom thieves with your crazy powers." She laughed as Asuka smirked in response.  
"唯一的另一条规则就是不要滥用能力去做违法的事情。总不能让你们三个用这些疯狂的能力变成幻影盗贼吧。" 她笑着说，而明日香则回应了一个得意的微笑。

"Says the one who's drinking magically summoned beer without paying a dime."  
"说得好像那个喝着魔法召唤出来的啤酒却一毛不拔的人不是你一样。"

"Hey, there's exceptions to every rule, right?"  
"嘿，凡事总有例外，对吧？"

"I'll bet there is." Asuka muttered under her breath. Sitting next to her, Shinji grimaced. That meant more trouble waited for them in the future.  
"我敢打赌是的。" 明日香低声嘟囔。坐在她旁边的真嗣皱了皱眉。这意味着未来还有更多的麻烦在等着他们。

---

Pots and pans could be heard crashing about in the kitchen. He distinctly heard the sound of a plate crashing to the ground violently.  
厨房里传来锅碗瓢盆的碰撞声。他清楚地听到一个盘子猛烈地摔碎在地上的声音。

"Jesus Rei! You're so damn clumsy!"  
“天哪，丽！你真是笨手笨脚！”

"I honestly do believe that was your fault Asuka."  
“老实说，我确实认为是你的错，明日香。”

"I might not be able to use my bracelet, but don't make me slap you with a spatula!"  
"我可能用不了我的手环，但别逼我用平底锅扇你！"

More arguing followed as Shinji prayed that his precious tools would survive the siege. He knew the bracelets could fix just about any damage, but he also believed that the two girls he lived with could easily defy logic and cause an armageddon. Reaching for his music player, he jammed the two earphones in and played some Pachelbel. It was the only way he was going to be able to relax amongst the destruction.  
争吵声此起彼伏，真嗣祈祷着他珍爱的工具能在这场围攻中幸存。他知道手环几乎能修复任何损伤，但他也相信与他同住的两位女孩能轻易地违背逻辑，引发一场末日浩劫。他伸手拿起音乐播放器，塞上两只耳机，播放了一段帕赫贝尔的音乐。这是他在破坏中寻求放松的唯一方式。

For whatever reason possessed them, the girls had decided they wanted to make Shinji breakfast this morning. He had debated endlessly with them why this was not a good idea, and the pair of them had not given him any wiggle room to come up with a decent argument. In the end, not only was he confused as to why he was having breakfast made for him, he was also worried about whether or not he would survive eating the results.  
不知为何，女孩们决定今天早上要为真嗣做早餐。他曾与她们争论为何这不是个好主意，但她们没给他任何回旋的余地来提出一个像样的论点。最终，他不仅困惑于为何有人为他做早餐，还担心自己是否能安然无恙地吃下这些成果。

After an agonising twenty minute wait, he heard a knock on the door, and a somewhat worryingly out of breath Asuka. Her hair was a tousled mess and she looked hot and sweaty.  
经过二十分钟的煎熬等待，他听到了敲门声，随之而来的是有些令人担忧的气喘吁吁的明日香。她的头发凌乱不堪，看起来又热又汗。

"We... are... done. Come, eat... now."  
“我们……做完了。来，吃……现在。”

Glancing over at the clock, Shinji decided against telling her it was way past midday. Breakfast time was well and truly over by now, but he really didn't fancy anymore concussions this week.  
瞥了一眼时钟，真嗣决定不告诉她现在已经过了中午。早餐时间早已过去，但他这周真的不想再有任何脑震荡了。

Gingerly stepping out of his room, he wandered over to where the smell of food was coming from, mentally noting that it at least smelled edible. Making it to the kitchen, which sported several charred scars over the walls, he spotted a plate of omelette, with a generous serving of sausages and bacon on the side. Most of all, it actually looked really good.  
小心翼翼地走出房间，他循着食物的香味走去，心里暗自庆幸至少闻起来还能吃。来到厨房，只见墙上留有几处焦黑的痕迹，他发现了一盘煎蛋卷，旁边还搭配着丰盛的香肠和培根。最重要的是，它看起来真的非常美味。

"She wrestled with the eggs, I handled the meat." Asuka collapsed on the sofa, next to an equally exhausted looking Rei.  
“她对付鸡蛋，我负责肉类。”明日香瘫倒在沙发上，旁边是同样疲惫不堪的绫波。

Smiling at the two beaten girls, Shinji sat down at the table.  
对着两位筋疲力尽的女孩微笑，真嗣在桌旁坐下。

"Thanks for the food!" With caution thrown to the wind, he picked up his first mouthful and dug in. After about five minutes of furious eating later, Shinji put down his plate, and reminisced.  
"谢谢款待！" 他不顾一切地拿起第一口，大快朵颐。大约五分钟后，真嗣放下盘子，陷入了回忆。

He was surprised he was still alive, and more importantly...  
他惊讶自己还活着，更重要的是……

"That was probably the best breakfast I have ever had in my entire life." The two girls smiled after hearing the compliment.  
"那大概是我这辈子吃过的最棒的早餐了。" 听到这番赞美，两位女孩露出了微笑。

"It had better have been. Dear god, cooking is way harder than anything I've ever done in my life!"  
最好是这样。天哪，做饭可比我在生活中做过的任何事情都难多了！

After the meal, there were plans to go out for the day. It was then Rei decided that she could show everyone another useful feature with the bracelets. Everybody was sat in front of Rei, Misato included, as she began her mini-lesson.  
饭后，大家计划外出一天。就在这时，丽决定向大家展示手环的另一个实用功能。所有人都坐在丽面前，包括美里，她开始了一场迷你课程。

"We can use the bracelets to quickly and easily change clothes. The bracelet can store up to one hundred and eight different types of clothes that we can assign a name and category to. For example-...!"  
"我们可以利用这些手环快速轻松地更换衣服。手环能储存多达一百零八种不同类型的服装，我们可以为它们命名并分类。比如说——...！"

"WAITWAITWAIT, stop!" Asuka quickly covered Shinji's eyes as the blue-headed girl began to activate her bracelet. "You're not going to change in front of him are you!? He'll see everything!"  
"等等等等，停下！" 明日香迅速捂住真嗣的眼睛，因为蓝头发的女孩开始激活她的手环。"你不会打算在他面前换衣服吧？！他会看到一切的！"

"To begin with, if its Ikari, I wouldn't mind in the slightest..."  
"说起来，如果是碇的话，我一点儿也不介意..."

"HEY!" Asuka's eyes widened as she tried leaping for Rei, stopped only by Shinji holding her back.  
“嘿！”明日香瞪大了眼睛，试图扑向绫波，却被真嗣拦住了。

"But the bracelet covers for that, by applying a veil of light over the body. The exchange of clothes happens near-instantaneously, so we are effectively censored." Ignoring Shinji's muttered remarks of how badly that sucked, Misato suddenly piped up.  
"但手环通过在身体上覆盖一层光幕来解决这个问题。换衣服几乎是瞬间完成的，所以我们实际上是被屏蔽了。" 无视真嗣低声抱怨这有多糟糕，美里突然插话道。

"So it's something like a magical girl transformation like you see in those old anime's?"  
"所以它有点像那些老动漫里的魔法少女变身？"

"I... think so?" Rei didn't sound entirely sure of herself. "I haven't really seen a lot of anime, if any at all if I'm being honest." Ignoring her, Asuka jumped up, excited to try out the new feature.  
"我... 应该是吧？" 绫波听起来并不完全确定。"老实说，我其实没看过多少动漫，如果有的话。" 无视她的疑虑，明日香兴奋地跳起来，迫不及待要尝试这个新功能。

"This is going to save me so much time getting ready in the morning! Does it do your hair as well?" At Rei's nod, she practically squealed with joy.  
"这会让我早上准备节省好多时间！它还能帮你做头发吗？" 看到丽点头，她几乎高兴得尖叫起来。

"I swear I've dreamt of this day my entire life!" She lifted her bracelet arm up so that it pointed to the sky, attempting a cool pose she had seen in the anime's.  
"我发誓我这辈子都在梦寐以求这一天！" 她抬起戴着手镯的手臂指向天空，试图摆出一个她在动漫里见过的酷酷的姿势。

"I should probably mention that..." Ignoring Rei once again, Asuka happily chanted for the set of clothes she wore the most often.  
"我应该提一下的……" 无视了丽，明日香开心地念出了她最常穿的那套衣服的咒语。

"School uniform!" "校服！"

"...that you need to be wearing the clothes and set them to the bracelet before doing it for the first time... the transformation will fail otherwise and..." Rei faltered off, sounding genuinely worried. She was not alone, the sentiment was felt by everybody in the room. Especially for Shinji who had been sat right in front of what was now a full-frontal birthday suit version of his childhood friend.  
"...你需要在第一次使用前穿上衣服并设定到手环上...否则变身会失败，而且..." 丽的声音渐渐弱了下去，听起来真的很担心。房间里的每个人都感受到了这种情绪。尤其是真嗣，他就坐在他儿时好友现在全裸的面前。

Asuka was in complete and utter shock.  
明日香完全惊呆了。

Regaining his senses was by no means an easy feat, Shinji had wanted to burn the image in front of him into his retinas for a little while longer, but every single instinctual fibre in his being was telling him to run, and run as far as he possibly could.  
恢复意识绝非易事，真嗣本想将眼前这一幕烙印在视网膜上再久一些，但他的每一根本能的纤维都在告诉他逃跑，跑得越远越好。

But just as he was getting out of his chair and backing away towards the door, he heard the scariest voice in the world come out of Asuka's shaking mouth.  
但就在他起身离开椅子，向门口退去时，他听到了世界上最可怕的声音从明日香颤抖的嘴里传出。

"Come here Shinji." “过来，真嗣。”

"I think its far safer if I stay over here to be perfectly honest." Asuka looked up at him with an unrivalled rage in her eyes as she leapt the distance between Shinji and herself.  
“老实说，我觉得我待在这边要安全得多。”明日香抬头瞪着他，眼中燃烧着无法遏制的怒火，随即一跃而起，跨越了与真嗣之间的距离。

"STAND STILL! I need to beat this memory out of you!"  
"站住别动！我得把你这段记忆打出来！"

It took almost two hours to calm the raging German girl down.  
花了将近两个小时才让那个暴怒的德国女孩平静下来。

---

"So what do we do now, Gendo?"  
"那我们现在怎么办，源堂？"

The bespectacled man sat at his desk, his orange-tinted glasses reflecting the monitor on his desk, head resting on top of his interlocked fingers. He wore a grim expression, which reflected on the tone of his voice as he spoke.  
戴眼镜的男子坐在桌前，橙色镜片的眼镜反射着桌上的显示器，头枕在交扣的指尖上。他面色凝重，说话的语气也透露出同样的沉重。

"We don't have many other options, do we?"  
“我们没有太多其他选择了，是吧？”

"You're being overly dramatic about all this."  
"你在这件事上太夸张了。"

"Overly dramatic!? This is SEELE we're talking about Yui! I'd say I'm being a little under-dramatic if anything!" Yui rolled her eyes as she glanced over his shoulder at the monitor.  
"太夸张了？！我们说的是 SEELE，Yui！如果有什么的话，我觉得自己还表现得不够夸张呢！" Yui 翻了个白眼，目光越过他的肩膀看向显示器。

"Misato will keep an eye on the kids, and she has her own bracelet now, so she'll be alright."  
"美里会照看孩子们的，她现在有自己的手环了，所以她会没事的。"

"What if they send the JSSDF into the school? Three kids and one teacher cannot protect an entire school, no matter what crazy powers we think they might have."  
"如果他们派自卫队进入学校怎么办？三个孩子和一个老师无法保护整个学校，无论我们觉得他们可能拥有多么疯狂的力量。"

"You know, its normally me doing all the worrying. What's got you so spooked Gendo?"  
"你知道的，通常都是我在担心。是什么让你这么紧张，源堂？"

His eyes turned to the desk, his face hidden in shadows and dark thoughts. Memories of a past life were coming back to haunt him. Memories of when he should have spent less time worried about his work and more time worried about how to be a father.  
他的目光转向书桌，脸庞隐没在阴影和阴郁的思绪中。前世的记忆正悄然回潮，萦绕心头。那些本该少些工作忧虑、多些如何成为好父亲思考的时光。

"I just... I don't want to lose him. I don't want to lose any of them..."  
“我只是……我不想失去他。我不想失去他们中的任何一个……”

His sincerity and sudden sombre mood had Yui stunned. Where did this come from all of a sudden? Gendo wasn't normally one for revealing his troubles. Snaking her arms around his shoulders, she leant her head on top of his and smiled.  
他的真诚和突如其来的忧郁让唯感到震惊。这一切是怎么突然冒出来的？源堂通常不是一个会表露烦恼的人。她伸出双臂环绕他的肩膀，将头靠在他的头上，微笑着。

"They'll be fine. I promise you now, we've worked too hard to let anything happen to them. Not to mention, they're all incredibly smart kids for their age. And Misato is far more intelligent then she lets those around her think."  
“他们会没事的。我向你保证，我们已经付出了太多努力，不会让任何事情发生在他们身上。更不用说，他们都是同龄人中极其聪明的孩子。而且美里远比她让周围人认为的要聪明得多。”

Her warm words brought a huge amount of comfort to him. A rarely seen smile flickered from underneath his hands that concealed his mouth. It was just what he had needed to hear.  
她温暖的话语给他带来了巨大的安慰。一个罕见的微笑从他遮住嘴巴的手下闪现。这正是他需要听到的。

The following morning, things were considerably peaceful, considering the mayhem that had occurred on the last day of the weekend. Walking along the road, Asuka felt the urge to skip, and almost gave in to her desires. But her pride wouldn't let her live with herself if the two knuckleheads behind her caught wind of what she was doing.  
次日清晨，考虑到周末最后一天的混乱，一切显得相当平静。走在路上，明日香有种想跳起来的冲动，几乎就要屈服于这份欲望。但她的自尊心不允许，如果身后那两个笨蛋察觉到她的举动，她可无法原谅自己。

She'd have to move to a country on the other side of the world, after carefully hiding the bodies.  
她得搬到地球另一端的国家去，还得小心翼翼地藏好尸体。

Still, she couldn't help herself but hum as she walked on the familiar path to school. Something that Rei had found it difficult to ignore for the past twenty minutes.  
尽管如此，她走在通往学校的熟悉小路上时，还是忍不住哼起了小曲。这让丽在过去二十分钟里很难忽视。

"You seem to be in an altogether cheerful mood this morning Asuka."  
“你今天早上似乎心情特别好，明日香。”

"You'll be too, after school tomorrow."  
"你明天放学后也会的。"

Shinji had promised both of them a date. Well, promised was a little subjective, but after cooking for him yesterday and after the vanishing clothes incident, they had both got a date out of the deal. Separately of course, but today was the day he'd be going out with Asuka. The following day would be Rei's turn.  
真嗣曾向她们两人承诺过一次约会。嗯，说‘承诺’或许有点主观，但在昨天为他做饭以及那次消失的衣服事件之后，她们都从这笔交易中得到了一次约会的机会。当然，是分别进行的，但今天是他将与明日香出去的日子。接下来的一天则是绫波的约会时间。

He'd had to resort to petitioning the bank of Mom and Dad in lieu of funds for the operation, but she didn't care about that right now. Her head was full of thoughts on what exactly they were going to do with their afternoon together. And how to make Shinji as bankrupt as possible before it was Rei's turn.  
他不得不求助于父母的银行来筹措资金，但她现在并不在乎这些。她的脑海里充满了关于他们下午将如何度过以及如何在轮到绫波之前尽可能让真嗣破产的想法。

Sitting on her chair in the classroom, she couldn't help but grin. Her leg was bouncing up and down wildly under her chair, something that her friend, Hikari, had picked up on almost instantly sitting in front of her.  
坐在教室的椅子上，她忍不住咧嘴笑了。她的腿在椅子下疯狂地上下弹动，坐在她前面的朋友光几乎立刻就注意到了这一点。

"I've never seen you smiling so much Asuka. Are you feeling okay? Do you want me to take you to the nurses office?"  
"我从没见过你笑得这么开心，明日香。你感觉还好吗？需要我带你去医务室吗？"

"Ha ha ha, shut up Hikari. I'm always in a fabulous mood and I take offence that you'd imply that I was ever a moody c-..."  
"哈哈哈，闭嘴吧，光。我总是心情超棒，你居然暗示我以前情绪不好，真是冒犯我了……"

"Nobody's going that far Asuka!" Hikari hastily stopped the chattering redhead, before letting out a giggle.  
“没人会走那么远的，明日香！” 光急忙制止了喋喋不休的红发女孩，随后忍不住笑出声来。

"But really... What's got you in such a good mood? I bet its to do with Shinji."  
但说真的...是什么让你心情这么好？我打赌这跟真嗣有关。

Asuka hadn't planned on how to cover it up if the topic had ever come up in class. As a result, the panic caused her to suddenly elbow her pencil case, sending it pinwheeling off her desk, its contents flying everywhere.  
明日香并没有预想过如果课堂上有人提起这件事该如何掩饰。因此，当话题突然出现时，她惊慌失措，手肘不慎撞到了笔袋，使其旋转着从桌上飞出，里面的物品散落一地。

"Haha, I guess that answers my question." Hikari chuckled as she helped the flustered girl pick up the pieces.  
“哈哈，看来这回答了我的问题。”光笑着，帮那位慌乱的女孩捡起碎片。

"Does that mean it's a date? Are you going on a date with Shinji!?"  
那是不是意味着这是约会？你要和真嗣去约会吗？！

"Why don't you say it a little louder!? I don't think the entire class heard you!" Asuka hissed as she tried to keep the bubble-mouthed class president silent.  
“你为什么不说得再大声点！？我觉得全班还没听到呢！” 明日香低声咆哮，试图让那位嘴巴像泡泡一样的班长闭嘴。

Instead of being quiet, Hikari made a strange squeaking noise, only fueling Asuka's rapidly spreading blush. She had to do something fast to stop the news spreading. Luckily, Misato chose that exact moment to wander through the door, looking strangely scared.  
非但没有安静下来，光却发出了一声奇怪的吱吱声，这让明日香的脸红得更快了。她必须尽快采取行动阻止消息扩散。幸运的是，美里恰好在那一刻推门而入，神情显得异常惊恐。

"Hey teach, I like the bracelet!"  
“嘿，老师，我喜欢那个手镯！”

Her new purple accessory shimmered in the light of the sun as she put her stuff on the desk.  
她新添的紫色配饰在阳光下闪闪发光，随着她将物品摆放在桌上。

"Thank you Toji, be sure you say the nice things to Hikari too when you have the chance."  
"谢谢你，冬二，有机会也别忘了对光说些好听的话。"

Both students immediately went redder than the sun, with Toji stumbling over his words as he tried to make excuses, with Kensuke laughing at him.  
两位学生立刻脸红得比太阳还红，冬二结结巴巴地试图找借口，而健介在一旁笑他。

"Miss, you can't-!" Hikari stopped her planned tirade when she felt Asuka poke her from behind.  
"老师，你不能——！"光正要发作，却感觉到背后的明日香戳了她一下。

"I'd say that's a pretty generous serving of karma, don't you think?" Grinning at her friend, Asuka laughed as she watched Hikari's face flash through about twenty different expressions, raging from indignant to embarrassed.  
“我得说，这可是相当慷慨的因果报应，你不觉得吗？”看着好友，明日香笑着，只见光的脸色变幻了约莫二十种表情，从愤愤不平到窘迫不已。

After the brief distraction, Misato's face went back to serious business, glancing specifically at both Shinji and Asuka with a worried glance. Feeling caught off-guard, both of them wondered what had their teacher so spooked. She even had her own all-powerful bracelet now, what could she possibly be so scared of?  
短暂的走神过后，Misato 的脸色又恢复了严肃，她特意用忧虑的目光扫视了 Shinji 和 Asuka。两人感到措手不及，不知道是什么让他们的老师如此惊慌。她现在连自己那无所不能的手镯都有了，还有什么能让她害怕的呢？

"First things first ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to introduce a transfer student."  
女士们先生们，首先让我们欢迎一位转学生。

"Another one!?" Toji cheered from the back of the class. "Please let it be another cutie, and god please don't let her anywhere near Shinji."  
"又来一个！？" 冬二在教室后排欢呼道，"请让她是个可爱的女孩，天啊，千万别让她靠近真嗣。"

Shinji nodded violently in agreement. He didn't need anymore crazy girls in his life. Asuka had also nodded crazily, her thoughts in almost perfect-sync with her romantic interest.  
真嗣猛烈地点头表示同意。他不需要生活中再有更多疯狂的女孩了。明日香也疯狂地点头，她的想法几乎与她的恋爱对象完全同步。

"Please treat her with respect and Hikari?"  
"请尊重她，还有光？"

"Yes teacher?" "是的，老师？"

"Make sure Toji doesn't end up molesting her." Hikari's eyes lit up with a raging fire, accented with a terrifying grin.  
“确保冬二不会对她动手动脚。”光的眼神中燃起了熊熊怒火，嘴角勾起一抹骇人的笑意。

"You can count on me!" Nodding in approval, Misato ignored Toji's protests of innocence and turned her gaze towards the door.  
"你放心交给我吧！" 美里点头表示同意，无视了真嗣的清白辩解，将目光转向了门口。

"Okay, you may come in!"  
“好的，你可以进来了！”

The door gently slid open. After what felt like an eternity, a creamy white shoe entered through the threshold, and once again, Shinji Ikari felt like his world had ended in a heartbeat.  
门轻轻地滑开了。仿佛过了一个世纪，一只奶白色的鞋子跨过门槛，而再一次，碇真嗣感到他的世界在瞬间终结了。

"Hello everyone, its a pleasure to meet you! I'm a little bit nervous but I hope we can all get along!"  
“大家好，很高兴见到你们！我有点紧张，但希望我们能好好相处！”

A cerulean-blue pair of eyes had found their mark, centering onto Shinji's dark grey ones. He felt terror, unaware that he had never been this scared in his life. The lips under those eyes curled into a sweet smile. She brushed a strand of her darkened crimson hair out of face.  
一双天蓝色的眼眸锁定了目标，聚焦在真嗣深灰色的双眸上。他感到恐惧，未曾意识到自己一生中从未如此害怕过。那双眼睛下的唇角勾起一抹甜美的微笑。她轻轻拂开脸颊上的一缕深红发丝。

"Especially with you, Shinji Ikari."  
“尤其是你，碇真嗣。”

### Chapter 6: Run! 第六章：快跑！  

Standing at the front of the class with her sparkling smile gleaming, Mana Kirishima beamed at him as Shinji sat in his chair, paralysed by fear.  
站在教室前排，闪耀的笑容熠熠生辉，Mana Kirishima 对他微笑着，而 Shinji 坐在椅子上，因恐惧而动弹不得。

"Oh my god, really!?" Toji cried, echoing the sentiment of all the boys in the class. The girls had started whispering and giggling with each other at the sudden new development.  
“我的天，真的吗！？”Toji 喊道，这番话也代表了班上所有男生的心声。女生们则开始窃窃私语，对这突如其来的新情况咯咯笑了起来。

"_Another girl!?_" “又是一个女孩！？”

"I thought he was engaged or something to Rei?"  
“我以为他和丽订婚了呢？”

"He's got three girls on the go!? _At his age!?_"  
“他同时和三个女孩交往！？他这年纪！？”

"What about Asuka? She is going to _**flip**_..."  
"那明日香呢？她会气炸的……"

The girl in question could hear nothing of the gossip floating around the class. All she could hear was the sound of her rapidly raging pulse.  
当事人对班上流传的八卦一无所知，她只能听到自己急速跳动的心跳声。

Rei, on the other hand, was sat stock still in her chair by the window, in shock and looking very dazed.  
另一方面，丽坐在窗边的椅子上，一动不动，震惊得看起来有些茫然。

"Shinji...? You feeling okay?" Misato asked gingerly, aware that he was probably going through an internal meltdown. Mana kept up her radiant smile as she took a step towards his table.  
"真嗣...？你感觉还好吗？" 美里小心翼翼地问道，意识到他可能正在经历内心的崩溃。真奈保持着她那灿烂的笑容，向他的桌子迈了一步。

"He's probably just surprised."  
"他可能只是惊讶而已。"

"Let me slap him! Just once! It won't even hurt...!" Toji was furiously shouting from his chair as Hikari tried her best to keep him under control. She was beginning to consider taking a page from Asuka's book and putting him into a headlock.  
"让我扇他一巴掌！就一下！根本不会疼的...！" 东治从椅子上愤怒地喊道，而光子正尽力控制住他。她开始考虑效仿明日香的做法，给他来个锁喉。

"It's been about eight years Shinji." Mana had stopped in front of the visibly shaken boy.  
"已经过去大约八年了，真嗣。" 玛娜在明显动摇的男孩面前停下了脚步。

"_Do you remember me?_" "你还记得我吗？"

Something inside him snapped. Standing up as fast as he could, he bolted for the classroom door as fast as humanly possible.  
他内心有什么东西崩断了。他尽可能快地站起来，以人类可能达到的最快速度冲向教室门。

"SHINJI!" "真嗣！"

Misato's shout of surprise went unanswered as the poor boy literally leapt over tables trying to get away.  
美里惊讶的呼喊没有得到回应，可怜的男孩简直是跳过桌子试图逃走。

"**OH NO YOU DON'T!**" "休想逃！"

Mana's cry echoed around the classroom as she lifted up her arm. It was only then Rei, who had started recovering from her stupor, noticed that Mana was wearing a cerulean bracelet.  
玛娜的哭声在教室里回荡，她举起手臂。直到这时，从恍惚中开始恢复的丽才注意到，玛娜戴着一只天蓝色的手镯。

Just like the one she wore.  
就像她自己戴的那只一样。

Seconds later, her attention was diverted to the fact that Shinji was now enveloped in a bubble-like prison, stopping the panic-stricken boy from escaping.  
几秒钟后，她的注意力被转移到真嗣被一个气泡般的牢笼困住的事实上，这个惊慌失措的男孩无法逃脱。

"Shinji... " Mana purred flirtatiously as she began to walk towards the entrapped boy.  
"真嗣... " 玛娜挑逗地低声说道，开始向被困的男孩走去。

"You mustn't run away." "你不能逃跑。"

"**SOMEBODY SAVE ME!**" Shinji shrieked in a voice that could only be described as the embodiment of blood-curdling terror as he banged from the inside of the bubble fruitlessly.  
"谁来救救我！" 真嗣尖叫着，声音只能被形容为令人毛骨悚然的恐惧化身，他在泡泡内部徒劳地敲打着。

Needless to say, the whole class was in shock. Even Asuka, Rei and Misato, who were used to seeing this kind of supernatural science, were left dumbfounded.  
毋庸置疑，全班都陷入了震惊之中。即便是习惯了这种超自然科学的绫波零、惣流·明日香·兰格雷和葛城美里，也都被惊得目瞪口呆。

"I've waited a long time to see you again." Inside the bubble, shackles materialised around Shinji's arms, locking them behind his back. A collar with a chained leash appeared around his neck.  
“我等了很久，终于又见到你了。”在泡泡内部，锁链缠绕在真嗣的手臂上，将它们锁在背后。一个带有链条的项圈出现在他的脖子上。

"W-w w-what the hell is this!?" He looked down at his new accessories, utterly terrified. The bubble around him popped, and he dropped unceremoniously to the ground. Picking up the leash, a grin that would have a yandere running for the hills replaced her sweet smile from moments before.  
“这、这到底是什么鬼东西！？”他低头看着自己的新配饰，完全吓坏了。围绕他的泡泡破裂了，他狼狈地摔在地上。她捡起牵引绳，刚才的甜美笑容被一个足以让病娇逃跑的狞笑所取代。

"I've told you this already, but I'll tell you again." Mana stood over him, her figure a hundred times more intimidating than Asuka's could ever be. Somewhere in his brain, a little voice quietly muttered that her black-lace panties that were peeking out from under her skirt were rather daring, but it was drowned out by the rest of his brain shrieking from the horrifying smile she was giving him.  
"我已经告诉过你这件事了，但我还会再告诉你一遍。" 玛娜站在他上方，她的身影比明日香能有的任何姿态都要可怕百倍。在他脑海的某个角落，一个小小的声音悄悄嘀咕着她裙下露出的黑色蕾丝内裤颇为大胆，但这声音被他大脑其余部分因她那恐怖的微笑而发出的尖叫声淹没了。

"_You mustn't run away._" "你绝不能逃跑。"

---

"What's their status!?" Yui yelled to the room. Maya, Shigeru and Aoba all jumped to attention, alongside Satsuki, Kaede and Aoi on their various terminals. Furious typing could be heard around the control room, overlooked by Gendo Ikari in his trademark pose, leaning on his interlocked fingers.  
"他们的状况如何！？" 绫波零向房间里喊道。真希、茂和青叶都立刻集中注意力，与在各自终端前的皋月、枫和葵一起。控制室内回荡着激烈的键盘敲击声，被以标志性姿势——双手交叠支撑着下巴——的碇源堂监视着。

"Shinji's been kidnapped, and is being held hostage in a... bubble-like prison?" Satsuki looked at her monitor in confusion. "I don't understand what's going on at all..."  
"真嗣被绑架了，还被关在一个...泡泡一样的监狱里？" 萨兹琪困惑地看着她的显示器。"我完全搞不懂这是怎么回事..."

"You're telling me. Who is this girl?" Kaede looked at the video footage displaying one of the school's corridors, keeping track of the red-headed girl holding Shinji hostage. Her eyes suddenly widened. "Oh shit!"  
"你问我，我问谁。这个女孩是谁？" 枫看着显示学校走廊的视频，追踪着那个挟持真嗣的红发女孩。她的眼睛突然睁大了。"哦，该死！"

All of the monitors in the room suddenly flashed.  
房间里所有的显示器突然闪烁起来。

"Explosion detected! Major damage to the school exterior on the third floor!"  
"检测到爆炸！学校三楼外墙遭受重大损坏！"

"Are the kids okay!?" "孩子们没事吧！？"

"No injuries! Asuka and Rei are in pursuit of Shinji and the mysterious girl."  
"无人受伤！明日香和绫波正在追捕真嗣和那位神秘女孩。"

Yui gritted her teeth as she watched the ongoing battle on the giant main screen. It seemed like she knew the girl from somewhere, but the memory was proving to be elusive.  
优看着巨大的主屏幕上正在进行的战斗，咬紧了牙关。她似乎在某个地方见过那个女孩，但记忆却难以捉摸。

"Do you not recognise her, Yui?" The gravelly tones emanating from Gendo slightly surprised her. He wasn't usually in such a somber mood.  
“你不认识她吗，优？”源堂那沙哑的声音让她略感惊讶。他平时很少有这么严肃的情绪。

"What, do you?" She turned around to face her husband.  
“怎么，你认识？”她转过身来面对她的丈夫。

"Eight years ago. She was the survivor."  
"八年前。她是幸存者。"

The memories flooded back to her, each more heartbreaking than the last. Turning to face the screen again, her eyes were glued to the girl's face, now recognisable to her.  
记忆如潮水般涌回，每一份都比前一份更令人心碎。她再次转向屏幕，目光紧紧锁定在那女孩的脸上，如今已能认出。

"But... why? What's she doing?! And why does she have a bracelet!?" Gendo's eyes appeared colder than ice as he peered over his orange-tinted glasses.  
"但是...为什么？她在做什么？！还有她为什么戴着手镯！？" 碇源堂透过橙色镜片的眼眸显得比冰还要冷。

"Our _friends_ have managed to pull the rug from under our feet once again."  
"我们的朋友们又一次成功地让我们措手不及。"

---

Alarms were blaring all over the school. The students had been evacuated and the perimeter had been surrounded by police and the military. Helicopters buzzed angrily overhead, occasionally blocking out the sun which was beginning to set, turning the sky an ominous crimson.  
警报声在学校各处此起彼伏。学生们已被疏散，警方和军队将周边团团围住。直升机在头顶愤怒地嗡嗡作响，不时遮住初升的太阳，将天空染成不祥的深红。

Misato was outside with the students, making sure everyone was safe, whilst occasionally glancing back at the school, panic-stricken.  
美里和学生们在外面，确保每个人都是安全的，同时不时紧张地回头望向学校。

"_We have identified a potential terrorist threat on the school premises. Do not enter the school or surrounding area for any reason until further notice_."  
“我们已经识别到学校范围内存在潜在的恐怖威胁。在进一步通知之前，请勿以任何理由进入学校或周边区域。”

The school PA system was echoing what was also being broadcast outside to the civilians and students milling around the school gates. Asuka smirked as she continued running around the school corridors.  
学校的广播系统正重复播放着同样的内容，这些信息也被传达到学校大门外聚集的平民和学生们耳中。明日香一边继续在学校的走廊里奔跑，一边露出了得意的笑容。

"Her first day here and she's branded as a terrorist. That's certainly an achievement."  
她第一天来就被打上了恐怖分子的标签。这确实是个‘成就’。

She continued running down the corridors, her eyes peeled at every corner and doorway she came across. Judging from the giant hole that tore a large chunk away from the third floor corridor, she had come to assume that Mana wasn't taking any chances.  
她继续沿着走廊奔跑，对每一个角落和门口都保持高度警惕。从三楼走廊上那个巨大的破洞来看，她推测玛娜不会放过任何机会。

It was kill or be killed.  
不是你死就是我亡。

As she came up to the next corridor's corner, she suddenly heard footsteps. Slowing down to a crawl, she tiptoed her way towards the corner, her back pressed against the wall. Her hands were shaking, causing the bracelet to rattle.  
当她走到下一个走廊的拐角时，突然听到了脚步声。她放慢速度，蹑手蹑脚地向拐角靠近，背部紧贴着墙壁。她的手在颤抖，导致手镯发出响声。

"Come on Asuka... GO!" Clenching her teeth, she jumped around the corner and raised her bracelet arm's palm to attack. She was faced with Rei, in exactly the same stance.  
“来吧，明日香...冲啊！”她咬紧牙关，跳过拐角，举起戴着手镯的手掌准备攻击。却看到绫波零，正摆着完全相同的姿势。

"Jesus! I was ready to blow you to hell..."  
天哪！我差点就把你轰进地狱了...

"I can see that. Better luck next time, I suppose." Asuka was this close to giving the sarcastic girl a slap in response, but decided against it for the moment. "I assume this means you've had no success finding him either."  
"我看得出来。下次运气好点吧，我想。" 明日香差点就要给这个爱挖苦的女孩一巴掌，但暂时决定忍住。"我猜这意味着你也没找到他。"

"What do you think, genius..." Asuka sighed as she ran her fingers through her hair. They had lost contact with Shinji a while back, after Mana had nearly obliterated them both.  
"你以为呢，天才..." 明日香叹了口气，手指穿过头发。他们和真嗣失去联系已经有一段时间了，自从玛娜差点把他们俩都干掉之后。"

"We better stick together from now, and watch each others backs. Splitting up was a good idea, but we're more likely to end up killing each other if we're jumping at shadows..."  
"我们最好从现在开始一起行动，互相照应。分开是个好主意，但如果我们总是疑神疑鬼，更有可能自相残杀..."

"I agree." Rei nodded. Suddenly, Rei jumped forward, catching Asuka around the waist and pushing her to the ground. "Watch out!"  
"我同意。" 丽点了点头。突然，丽向前一跃，搂住明日香的腰将她推倒在地。"小心！"

Another explosion tore through the windows they had been standing next to not a second earlier. Sparkling glass showered over them as the windows buckled. Shards cut into the both of them, leaving a nasty cut on Asuka's face and a similar wound over Rei's arm.  
又一声爆炸在他们刚刚站立的窗户旁炸开，玻璃如雨般闪烁着碎片洒落。窗户扭曲变形，碎片划伤了两人，在明日香的脸颊上留下一道狰狞的伤口，而零的胳膊上也出现了类似的伤痕。

"She... is so dead... Owowowow..." Asuka twinged in pain as she stood up. Helping Rei to her feet, their eyes met. Nodding together, they began running towards the staircase.  
"她...死定了...哎哟哟哟..." 明日香痛苦地站起身来。她扶起丽，两人的目光相遇。一起点头后，她们开始向楼梯跑去。

"She's outside!" "她在外面！"

---

"You've suddenly gone incredibly quiet Shinji"  
"你突然变得异常安静，真嗣"

"I doubt you'd be overly conversational either if your captor was a maniacal pyrotechnic who had you locked in a darkened gym storage room."  
"如果绑架你的人是个疯狂的烟火师，把你锁在黑暗的体育馆储藏室里，我想你也不会太健谈的。"

He couldn't really make out much in the dark, but he was well aware that Mana was straddled on top of him. When he squinted, he could just about make out the mischievous grin on her face.  
他在黑暗中看不太清楚，但他很清楚玛娜正骑在他身上。当他眯起眼睛时，勉强能看到她脸上调皮的笑容。

"I'm pretty sure this is every teenage boy's dream, isn't it? To be underneath a hot girl in a dark room?"  
"我敢肯定，这是每个青春期男孩的梦想，不是吗？在黑暗的房间里被一个火辣的女孩压在下面？"

"I see you're not aware of your own narcissism."  
"看来你还没意识到自己的自恋倾向。"

Mana just smiled even more as she leaned in closer to his face, wrapping her arms around his neck.  
玛娜只是笑得更灿烂，她更靠近他的脸，双臂环抱住他的脖子。

"But I am aware that I'm way cuter than Asuka or Rei." She whispered into his ear. A raging flush rushed across his face, and he was rapidly becoming aware that his trousers were becoming painfully tight across his groin.  
"但我很清楚，我比明日香或绫波都要可爱得多。" 她在他耳边低语。他脸上涌起一阵狂热的潮红，他迅速意识到自己的裤子在胯部变得异常紧绷。

His nerves were on fire as he struggled to look for a response. It was true that he found Mana incredibly cute, and her bold, daring behaviour was not exactly unwelcome.  
他的神经如同被点燃般紧张，努力寻找着回应。确实，他觉得 Mana 非常可爱，她大胆无畏的行为也并非不受欢迎。

But he was also aware that if he didn't do something soon, Asuka and Rei would find them both in this compromising situation. He was sure they would destroy the school between them if that happened.  
但他也清楚，如果再不采取行动，Asuka 和 Rei 很快就会发现他们处于这种尴尬境地。他确信，真要那样，她们俩能把学校给拆了。

"I can't really deny that you are incredibly cute, putting aside the fact that you are a terrifying person." Shinji started talking as he began to struggle against his shackles. Whatever Mana was doing with her bracelet was cancelling out his ability to use his own.  
“我无法否认你的确非常可爱，尽管你是个可怕的人。” 真嗣开口说道，同时开始挣扎着摆脱束缚。Mana 用她的手镯所施展的某种力量，正在抵消他使用自身能力的可能。

But he had a theory.  
但他有一个理论。

For whatever reason, it seemed that the bracelets reacted to emotion. Not only that, but using them for extended periods of time would leave the user exhausted.  
无论出于何种原因，似乎这些手镯会对情绪产生反应。不仅如此，长时间使用它们会让使用者感到极度疲惫。

His plan meant that not only would he have to try something risky, it was dependant on Mana being somewhat already tired.  
他的计划意味着他不仅要尝试冒险的事情，还取决于麻奈是否已经有些疲倦。

And having her wrapped around his neck, breathing heavily into his ear was making it really hard to put his plan into action.  
她紧紧环绕在他脖子上，沉重地呼吸着，吹拂过他的耳畔，这让他实施计划变得异常困难。

Mana giggled, tightening her grip around him as she continued to whisper into his ear.  
麻奈咯咯笑着，双手更紧地环抱着他，继续在他耳边低语。

"I'm glad that you think so, Shinji. I've been waiting for you to say something like that for a very, very long time."  
“我很高兴你这么想，真嗣。我等你这么说已经等了很久很久了。”

Something about the way she said that didn't sit well with him. It almost sounded... sorrowful.  
她说话的方式让他感到不安，那语气几乎带着...悲伤。

Leaning up slightly, Shinji was met with her eyes. Eyes that seemed almost ready to cry.  
微微抬起身，真嗣迎上了她的目光。那双眼似乎随时都会流泪。

"Shinji... Did you miss me?"  
“真嗣...你想我了吗？”

Something was definitely off now. Where did all of her energy suddenly go? Why did she look like she was ready to have a mental breakdown? A million more questions rushed through his mind, but he realised he didn't have the time to think about it too hard right now. He had to do something before Asuka caught them together like this.  
现在肯定有什么不对劲。她的精力都突然消失到哪里去了？为什么她看起来像是快要精神崩溃了？无数的问题涌入他的脑海，但他意识到现在没有时间深究这些。他必须做点什么，以免明日香发现他们这样在一起。

"Mana..." He felt his shackles crumble underneath him. He hadn't done anything to set himself free, so it must have been her own doing.  
"真名..." 他感到身上的枷锁在他身下崩解。他没有采取任何行动来解放自己，所以这一定是她自己的行为。

"Save me Shinji... You have to save me..." She whispered again, this time her voice trembling. Before she had the chance to break down, Shinji wrapped his arms around her back, twisting his body so that he was now on top of her. He had somehow ended up straddling her, their positions reversed.  
"救救我，真嗣... 你必须救我..." 她再次低声说道，这次声音颤抖。在她崩溃之前，真嗣用双臂环抱住她的背部，扭转身体，让自己压在她身上。不知怎么地，他最终跨坐在她身上，两人的位置颠倒了。

"Mana, what's going on? Who do you need saving from?" Shinji had her bracelet arm held firmly with his right hand. But it seemed unnecessary at this point. It didn't look like she was going to fight back anymore.  
"Mana，怎么了？你需要从谁那里得救？" 真嗣用右手紧紧抓住她的手镯手臂。但此刻似乎没有必要了。看起来她不会再反抗了。

"Promise me you'll save me... From _them_." He was just about to ask who _they_ were. But with her free hand, Mana grabbed the back of Shinji's head, bringing him down closer to her face.  
"答应我你会救我……从他们手中。" 他正要问他们是谁。但用她自由的手，Mana 抓住了真嗣的后脑勺，把他拉近她的脸。

"You saved me back then. I know you can do it again." She smiled, a single tear streaming down her face. Closing her eyes, she brought herself closer, kissing a suddenly incredibly shocked Shinji.  
"那时你救了我。我知道你能再次做到。" 她微笑着，一滴泪顺着脸颊流下。闭上眼睛，她靠近了，吻了一个突然极度震惊的真嗣。

Her lips felt soft. That seemed to be the only thought that was running through his mind. Or it had been, until the door of the gym storage room blew open, revealing a horrified Asuka and Rei. Breaking off the kiss, Shinji sat up suddenly, painfully aware that he was still straddling Mana.  
她的唇感觉很柔软。这似乎是他脑海中唯一的念头。或者说，直到体育器材室的门突然被吹开，露出惊恐的明日香和绫波之前，这确实是他的唯一想法。中断了亲吻，真嗣突然坐起身，痛苦地意识到自己仍然跨坐在玛娜身上。

"I know you wouldn't believe me if I said it's not what it looks like, but can you at least believe that she started it?"  
“我知道即使我说这不是看上去的那样你们也不会相信，但至少能相信是她先开始的吗？”
