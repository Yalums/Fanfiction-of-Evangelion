### Chapter 1: I Live With Two Beautiful Angels!  
第一章：我与两位美丽天使同住！  

_Another name for this story could be: **The Asuka Langley Soryu Raising Project**. But I have a fetish for one-word story titles, so that didn't happen xD This story is slightly based on, yes you guessed it, **The Shinji Ikari Raising Project**! The manga, although the video game will have its references scattered around the story, here and there. Shinji starts out a lot more upbeat than he would normally be, but there is a reason for that, so bear with me!  
这个故事的另一个名字可能是：《惣流·明日香·兰格雷养成计划》。但我对单字标题情有独钟，所以没有采用那个名字 xD 这个故事在一定程度上是基于——没错，你猜对了——《碇真嗣养成计划》！虽然是以漫画为基础，但游戏中也会散落一些相关参考。真嗣一开始比平时要开朗得多，但这背后是有原因的，请耐心听我道来！_

The gentle rays of the morning sun peeked through the small gap in the curtain, reflecting the slowly falling dust floating lazily to the floor. The light managed to reach the face of a teenage boy who was fast asleep. A peaceful expression was etched on his face as he continued to enjoy a pleasant dream.  
清晨的阳光温柔地透过窗帘的缝隙，映照着缓缓飘落的尘埃，慵懒地落向地面。光线恰好照在了一个熟睡的少年脸上。他面带安详的表情，继续沉浸在美好的梦境中。

Mere inches away from him, a girl was breathing heavily, a furious, bright red blush on her face. She had light brown hair that she normally kept tied in twintails, but having woken up not that long ago, it lay tousled as she leaned over the sleeping boy, wrestling with her emotions. Her soft blue eyes looked over his face as loose strands of her hair fell over his nose and cheek.  
离他仅几英寸远的地方，一个女孩正急促地呼吸着，脸上泛起一片鲜艳的绯红。她有着浅棕色的头发，平时总是扎成双马尾，但因为刚醒来不久，头发凌乱地垂在熟睡的男孩上方，内心挣扎不已。她柔软的蓝眼睛凝视着他的脸庞，几缕发丝轻轻落在他的鼻尖和脸颊上。

She was debating whether or not to wake him normally, as was her intention when she first walked into this room, or to wake him with a raunchy morning kiss. Compounding the problem was the fact that she had only recently realised, within the last week or so, that she was madly in love with this boy. The soul with the name Shinji Ikari had been her childhood friend since forever, but her feelings had been evolving, growing and growing to the point where she could no longer deny that the spell had been cast.  
她在犹豫是像最初走进这房间时的打算那样正常叫醒他，还是用一个挑逗的早安吻来唤醒他。问题更加复杂的是，她最近才意识到，大约就在上周左右，她已经疯狂地爱上了这个男孩。名为碇真嗣的灵魂自幼便是她的青梅竹马，但她的感情一直在变化，不断增长，直到她再也无法否认那个魔咒已经降临。

She leaned in closer, close enough that she could feel his gentle breathing tickling the tip of her nose. Her mind was pretty much made up. Edging closer and closer to the prize, she began to close her eyes as she readied herself. This was going to be her first kiss.  
她更靠近了些，近到能感受到他轻柔的呼吸拂过她鼻尖。她的心意已决。她一步步接近目标，准备就绪时开始闭上眼睛。这将是一个初吻。

Nanometres away from Shinji's lips, she was seconds away from success when a grouchy voice echoed from the other room.  
距离碇真嗣的唇仅剩纳米之遥，她即将成功之际，另一间房里传来了一个不悦的声音。

"Asuka! How long does it take to wake a teenage boy? You're both gonna be late for school!"  
"明日香！叫醒一个青春期男孩要多久？你们上学都要迟到了！"

Their guardian, Misato Katsuragi, could be heard swigging a morning beer as she busied herself getting ready. Asuka could hear footsteps moving closer to the door, causing her to panic.  
他们的监护人，葛城美里，一边忙着准备，一边可以听到她在喝早上的啤酒。明日香听到脚步声越来越靠近门，这让她感到慌张。

"Just give me a second Misato!" Sighing with regret, she began to shake her unrequited love's shoulder until groaning could be heard.  
"再给我一秒钟，美里！"" 她叹了口气，带着遗憾开始摇晃她单相思的爱人的肩膀，直到听到呻吟声。

"Just another couple minutes, please..."  
“再等几分钟就好……”

"No can do Baka. We gotta get breakfast going. Hell, even Misato's awake before you today." Standing up, she made for the door. One of Shinji's eyelids cracked open, catching a glimpse of Asuka wearing a simple yellow vest top and short shorts that left very little to the imagination. As she walked out of his room, he allowed himself a small grin. He had been awake the whole time since Asuka first entered the room, keeping it secret that he was already conscious. He was aware that Asuka had been doing strange things like this for a while, but he wasn't yet quite sure how to deal with it. The girl baffled his mind. Was she in heat? He was sure if he mentioned the idea, he'd meet the receiving end of some sharp object and be a lot worse off for it. Was she in love? With him?  
“不行啊，笨蛋。我们得准备早餐了。天哪，就连美里小姐今天都比你早起。”她站起身，朝门口走去。真嗣的一只眼皮微微睁开，瞥见明日香穿着一件简单的黄色背心和短裤，几乎没遮住什么。她走出他的房间时，他忍不住微微一笑。其实从明日香刚进房间起，他就一直醒着，只是偷偷装睡。他知道明日香最近一直在做这些奇怪的事，但他还没完全弄明白该怎么应对。这个女孩让他摸不着头脑。她是在发情吗？他敢肯定，如果他提出这个想法，肯定会遭到某种尖锐物体的攻击，后果不堪设想。她是在爱恋吗？对他？

Making a sound somewhere between a snort and a chuckle, Shinji got out of bed and began to pull on his regular school clothes. He was about as attractive as a mouse, and had the charisma of a fart, there was no way in hell she was attracted to him.  
真嗣发出一声介于哼声和轻笑之间的声音，从床上爬起来，开始穿上他平常的校服。他就像只老鼠一样不起眼，魅力也不过尔尔，她怎么可能对他有意思。

But the fact was, mere moments ago, the beautiful half-European bombshell of a girl he had lived with for a considerably long time now had tried to kiss him. He had never been this confused in his entire life.  
但事实是，就在片刻之前，那个与他同居了相当长时间的美丽欧亚混血女孩，竟然试图吻他。他这辈子从未如此困惑过。

As he walked out of the room, he yawned again, already exhausted from having to think so hard this early in the morning.  
当他走出房间时，他又打了个哈欠，一大早就得这么费神，他已经感到疲惫不堪了。

"What do people want for breakfast?"  
“人们早餐想吃什么？”

In response to his question directed to the household at large, Asuka ran out of the kitchen, now wearing her regular school uniform. Forcing a slice of toast into his mouth, she ran into her room whilst yelling at him.  
面对他向全家人提出的问题，明日香从厨房冲了出来，此刻已换上了她平时的校服。她强行将一片吐司塞进嘴里，一边跑向自己的房间，一边对他大喊。

"There's no time! We've overslept, we gotta get to school, asap!"  
“没时间了！我们睡过头了，得赶紧去学校，立刻马上！”

"Wait, what about breakfast?!" A horrified Misato sounded out her fears from her bedroom. If there was no time to make something for her, she would have to make herself something. An apocalyptic scenario if there ever was one.  
“等等，那早餐怎么办？！”美里从卧室里惊恐地表达出她的担忧。如果没时间给她准备，她就得自己动手了。这简直是末日般的情景。

"Don't you start your new job today? Aren't you late?" Asuka's muffled voice echoed from her bedroom. Several seconds of silence echoed throughout the house before...  
"你今天不是开始新工作吗？不会迟到了吧？" 明日香从卧室里传来的声音有些模糊。几秒钟的沉默在家中回荡，随后...

"OH SHIT, I'M LATE!" "我靠，要迟到了！"

Shinji grinned as he wandered into his bedroom to grab his bag. First day back at school for the new semester and things were going fabulously. As he made his way to the door, the two female cohabitants barrelled out their respective bedrooms, Asuka grabbing his arm on the way out of the house, half-eaten toast hanging on for dear life as it bounced wildly from the corner of her mouth.  
真嗣笑着走进卧室去拿书包。新学期第一天返校，一切顺利得不得了。当他走向门口时，两位女室友分别从各自的卧室冲了出来，明日香在出门时抓住了他的手臂，半块吐司顽强地挂在嘴角，随着她狂奔而上下颠簸。

"Have a good day guys, watch the road, don't get hit by cars or anything." Misato yelled from her own vehicle's window as she pumped the ignition. Seconds later, she was racing down the road, speed limits be damned in their entirety.  
"祝你们今天顺利，注意看路，别被车撞了什么的。" 美里从她自己的车窗里喊道，同时发动引擎。几秒钟后，她便疾驰而去，全然不顾限速规定。

"The only car we're going to have to worry about on the roads is that damned Alpine she drives." Asuka breathed as they both ran towards the station. After a lengthy ten minute jog to the station, they touched through the station gates with their cards and just barely made the train as the doors began to close.  
"在路上我们唯一需要担心的车就是她那辆该死的阿尔派。" 明日香喘着气说，他们俩一起跑向车站。经过长达十分钟的慢跑，他们用卡片刷过车站闸门，就在车门即将关闭之际，勉强赶上了火车。

"That... was... too close..." Asuka panted as she caught her breath. Shinji nodded in agreement, eyes fixed to the floor as his lungs stopped trying to kill him. He slowly stood up, catching his balance, when his first trial of the morning began by fire.  
"那...真是...太险了..." 明日香喘着气，终于缓过气来。真嗣点头表示同意，目光紧盯着地面，他的肺部终于不再试图置他于死地。他慢慢站起身，稳住平衡，而早晨的第一个考验就这样突然降临。

His beautiful roommate was sweating from all the running they'd just finished in the sweltering Japanese summer heat, causing her white shirt to look a little see-through in certain areas. And amongst that, it seems like they had been in far too much of a hurry for her to remember to wear a bra...  
他那美丽的室友因为刚在酷热的日本夏日中奔跑而满头大汗，使得她的白衬衫在某些地方显得有些透明。而且，似乎他们当时太过匆忙，她甚至忘了穿胸罩……

He felt his face ignite as a hot, red flush crawled up his face. There was a fair amount of people crowded onto this train, and one look at the wrong angle, and Asuka might begin to be considered an exhibitionist.  
他感到自己的脸庞像被点燃了一样，一阵火热的红晕爬上了脸颊。这辆列车上挤满了人，只要一个不恰当的角度看过去，明日香就可能被误认为是暴露狂。

"Asuka..." He whispered frantically. "Come here!"  
“明日香……”他急切地低声呼唤，“过来这里！”

He received a look of confused anger for his trouble, but he didn't really care about her temper at the moment. Motioning with his hand, Asuka eventually came over to his side. He prayed to every god that would listen to protect him from the consequences of his forthcoming actions, and quickly wrapped his arms around the German girl. Her face lit up crimson as she began to try and push herself away, she wasn't anywhere near mentally prepared for Shinji's sudden forwardness.  
他为此得到了一个既困惑又愤怒的眼神，但他此刻并不太在意她的脾气。用手示意，明日香最终还是来到了他身边。他向每一位愿意倾听的神明祈祷，保佑他免受即将采取行动的后果，然后迅速用双臂环抱住这位德国女孩。她的脸颊顿时变得通红，开始试图推开他，她完全没有心理准备应对真嗣这突如其来的亲近。

"What the hell are you doing, idiot Shinji!?"  
“你到底在干什么，笨蛋真嗣？！”

"You appear to have a slight wardrobe malfunction, and I'm protecting you from the lecherous idiots that share our train."  
“你似乎有点衣着上的小问题，我在保护你免受那些和我们同乘一车的色狼们的骚扰。”

"I count you as one of those idiots as well, asshole! The hell are you talking about, 'wardrobe malfunction'?" Asuka looked down at her dress, before quickly realising Shinji had made the right, if unexpected move.  
"我把你也算作那些白痴之一了，混蛋！你到底在说什么，'服装故障'？" 明日香低头看了看自己的裙子，随即迅速意识到，尽管出乎意料，但真嗣的举动是正确的。

"You have got to be joking..."  
"你一定是在开玩笑吧..."

"See?" Shinji grinned. "For my actions in the line of duty, I deserve immunity from concussion after this is all over."  
"看吧？" 真嗣咧嘴一笑。"就凭我在任务中的表现，这一切结束后，我应该免受脑震荡之苦。

"You'll be lucky not to get my foot up your ass as soon as we get off this damn train." Asuka mumbled as she held onto Shinji's shirt. "Don't you dare move until then. I hope to god Hikari's got a spare bra I can steal..."  
"下了这该死的火车，你最好祈祷别让我一脚踹你屁股上。" 明日香咕哝着，紧紧抓着真嗣的衬衫。"在那之前你敢动一下试试。希望老天保佑，光有备用的胸罩让我偷..."

"Will that even fit?" "那能合适吗？"

"What in the hell are you trying to say Ikari!? Hikari and me are roughly the same size..."  
"你到底想说什么，碇真嗣！？我和光身材差不多..."

"Fantastic, I now know roughly the bra size of our class president." Shinji grinned as he thought of informing Toji when he survived this particular hell.  
"太棒了，我现在大概知道我们班长的胸围了。" 真嗣咧嘴一笑，想着如果能从这场特别的炼狱中活下来，一定要告诉透治。

"Why do you know my bra size!?" Asuka hissed, her face could boil water instantly. "Asshole! Pervert!" She began beating his chest angrily.  
"你怎么会知道我的胸围！？" 明日香低声怒斥，她的脸瞬间红得能烧开水。"混蛋！变态！" 她开始愤怒地捶打他的胸膛。

"Hey, who does all of the washing in our house?"  
"嘿，家里所有的衣服都是谁洗的？"

"Fair point, but that doesn't mean you have to memorise this stuff!"  
"说得好，但这并不意味着你必须记住这些！"

"To be fair, I wash all of the clothes so often, I could recite Misato and your sizes from memory easily. Let me think, I'm sure you're something like a B-cup, and your..." A firm grasp on his ear made for an abrupt punctuation.  
"说真的，我洗了那么多衣服，很容易就能从记忆中背出美里和你尺码。让我想想，我肯定你是 B 罩杯，还有你的..." 他耳朵被紧紧抓住，话音戛然而止。

"Try telling the whole damn train Shinji, see what happens." The man standing behind Asuka shifted uncomfortably. The pain increased on Shinji's ear, and only stopped after a sharp yelp of pain escaped his lips.  
"试试告诉整列火车的人，真嗣，看看会发生什么。"站在明日香身后的男人不安地挪动着。真嗣的耳朵疼痛加剧，直到他发出一声痛苦的尖叫才停止。

"I'm sorry!" He half-meant it too. Back in the day, he had been too nervous to even talk to Asuka. Being able to tease her like his was something out of a dream, and he wanted to relish every second of it. Rolling her eyes, Asuka buried her head into his chest, partly to escape their confounding situation, but partly as a way to enjoy Shinji's scent under pretense.  
"对不起！" 他这话也半真半假。回想当初，他紧张得连和明日香说话都不敢。如今能像这样逗弄她，简直是梦寐以求的事，他想要好好享受每一刻。明日香翻了个白眼，把头埋进他的胸膛，一方面是为了逃避这令人困惑的处境，另一方面也是借机享受真嗣的气息，尽管是假借名义。

"Stupid idiot..." She mumbled to herself.  
"笨蛋..." 她喃喃自语。

What felt like an entirely too-short eternity to them both later, they arrived at their stop, after which they raced to their classroom, just making it in the nick of time. After a hasty conversation with the class president, Asuka and Hikari quickly dashed for the girls locker room, returning with a satisfied smile on both girls faces. Asuka's smile quickly turned to irritation after spotting Shinji's knowing grin and sat down on her chair, her mood in a strange place between sour and bashful after the events of the morning replayed in her head. Caught up in her bubbly daydream, she didn't even notice as their usual, old and frail homeroom teacher wandered in.  
对他们两人来说，仿佛是过于短暂的永恒之后，他们到达了目的地，随后便冲向教室，刚好赶在最后一刻。与班长匆忙交谈后，明日香和光速奔向女更衣室，回来时两人脸上都带着满意的微笑。看到真嗣那副了然于心的笑容，明日香的笑容迅速转为恼怒，坐回自己的椅子上，早晨发生的事在脑海中重播，让她心情复杂，既酸涩又羞涩。沉浸在欢快的白日梦中，她甚至没注意到他们那老迈衰弱的班主任缓缓走进教室。

"Good morning class. I have an announcement. I may have mentioned to everyone last week how this class would be getting a new homeroom teacher soon, and I am pleased to announced she has arrived, albeit five minutes late for her first day." The class giggled in response, with Shinji agreeing with the crowd. Asuka, on the other hand, had a sudden sinking feeling that she couldn't quite explain.  
"同学们早上好。我有个通知。上周我可能跟大家提过，这门课很快会有新的班主任，我很高兴地宣布她已经到了，尽管她第一天就迟到了五分钟。" 班级里响起一阵轻笑，真嗣也随声附和。然而，明日香却突然感到一种难以名状的沉重感。

"Without further ado, if you would please, Miss..."  
"废话不多说，请您，小姐……"

"Katsuragi." A familiar voice echoed from the front of the class as an equally similar head of purple hair walked pridefully into their classroom. Their guardian, looking slightly tousled after what must have been plenty of near-death experiences with other vehicles, was standing at the front of the class, grinning directly at her two roommates.  
"葛城。" 一个熟悉的声音从教室前方传来，同样熟悉的紫色头发骄傲地走进了教室。他们的监护人，看起来在经历了无数次与死神擦肩而过的车辆事故后略显凌乱，站在教室前，直接对着她的两个室友咧嘴笑。

"Good morning class, I'm sorry for the delay. As mentioned before, my name is Misato Katsuragi, and starting today, I'm going to be your new homeroom teacher! I hope we can all get along and have an awesome year together!" No sooner had she stopped talking then all the boys in the class erupted into cheers. The cheers stopped quickly however, when two indignantly loud voices cut through all of the noise and screamed as loud as they could.  
"同学们早上好，很抱歉迟到了。之前提过，我叫葛城美里，从今天开始，我就是你们的新班主任了！希望我们能相处融洽，共同度过一个精彩的一年！"她话音刚落，班上的男生们就爆发出欢呼声。然而，欢呼声很快就被两声愤怒的大喊打断，那声音盖过了所有的噪音，尖锐而响亮。

"YOU COULD'VE GIVEN US A LIFT EARLIER!"  
"你本可以早点载我们一程的！"

### Chapter 2: Gods of Creation  
第二章：创世之神  

"Honey, I'm serious!" “亲爱的，我是认真的！”

"Gendo, I think you're finally starting to crack..."  
“源堂，我觉得你终于开始崩溃了……”

"Yui, I'm not losing it. I have a daughter, her name is Hitagi Senjougahara!"  
"结衣，我没有疯。我有个女儿，她叫战场原黑仪！"

"No dear, you have a son. His name is Shinji Ikari. Unless you've been hiding something from me for all these years. But thankfully I have the past experience to know that you're dreams go out of control at the touch of a hat."  
"不，亲爱的，你有个儿子。他叫碇真嗣。除非这些年你一直对我有所隐瞒。但幸好我有过去的经验，知道你的梦境一触即发就会失控。"

"...and she has a boyfriend called Koyomi Araragi, who saved her from her disease of weightlessness caught from the crabs."  
"……而且她有个男朋友叫阿良良木历，他救她摆脱了从螃蟹那里感染的失重病。"

"For the love of god..."  
"看在上帝的份上..."

The two scientists sat over the diagram readouts, mumbling to each other over cups of strong coffee. Both looked completely exhausted, and Gendo's eyes danced around the room, his lack of sleep for over seventy-two hours beginning to spark insanity in his mind, whilst his wife looked on disgruntled. She was used to her husband being a little crazy sometimes, but the lack of sleep to her was testing her patience. Plus, the potential miracle of an experiment they were waiting to test was driving her mad. Having to wait to see the unbelievable that you knew was coming was testing her normally gentle and patient personality.  
两位科学家坐在图表读数前，一边喝着浓咖啡一边喃喃自语。两人看起来都筋疲力尽，碇源堂的眼睛在房间里四处游移，连续七十多小时未眠开始在他的脑海中点燃疯狂的火花，而他的妻子则不满地看着他。她已经习惯了丈夫偶尔的疯狂，但缺乏睡眠对她来说正在考验她的耐心。此外，他们等待测试的实验潜在的奇迹也在逼疯她。不得不等待见证你明知即将到来的不可思议之事，正在考验她原本温柔耐心的性格。

"...and she had beautiful, long purple hair."  
"...而她有着美丽的长长的紫色头发。"

"Gendo! We've got only a few hours before we have to let the kids know the experiments that will change their lives forever. And we sure as hell can't trust Kyoko to do it! Get your head out of your ass and focus!"  
"源堂！我们只剩下几个小时就要告诉孩子们那些将永远改变他们生活的实验了。而且我们绝对不能指望绫波零来做这件事！别再逃避现实，集中精神！"

"...she was a bit of a bitch though. All tsundere, killed all the cute." With her blood vessels reaching a critical breaking point, Yui Ikari cracked her husband around the head with a heavy folder.  
"...她虽然有点泼辣。典型的傲娇，把可爱都扼杀了。" 随着血管濒临破裂的临界点，碇唯用一个厚重的文件夹猛击了丈夫的头。

"You're going to be the death of me one of these days..." Yui mumbled as she massaged her aching head.  
""你总有一天会把我气死的..."" 碇唯一边嘟囔着，一边揉着疼痛的头部。

---

With the shock of their new homeroom teacher finally beginning to recede, Asuka hung her head behind her chair, staring at the ceiling. She didn't think she could handle more surprises today. She wanted Shinji's delicious home-cooked bento in her stomach, but lunch was still hours away. Stomach grumbling, she turned to face Shinji, who happened to sit next to her, flashing him a look of practiced annoyance. His response was a confused expression and a shrug, which wasn't the kind of attention she had been looking for.  
随着新班主任带来的震惊逐渐消退，明日香低着头躲在椅子后面，盯着天花板。她觉得今天已经无法再承受更多的惊喜了。她渴望吃到真嗣亲手做的美味便当，但午餐时间还遥遥无期。肚子咕咕叫着，她转向坐在旁边的真嗣，露出了一副惯常的恼怒表情。他的回应却是一脸困惑和耸肩，这并不是她所期待的反应。

Tearing out a scrap of paper from her notepad, she quickly began writing a message.  
她从笔记本上撕下一张纸条，迅速开始写起信息来。

_"I'm bored!" “我好无聊！”_

Having received it, Shinji quickly read the note and glanced at her, flashing a smile that agreed with her.  
收到纸条后，真嗣迅速阅读了一遍，然后瞥了她一眼，露出了一个与她心意相通的微笑。

_"Me too. I'm not paying attention at all. You got any ideas to kill the time?"_ Asuka thought about the response for a little while, until a small grin crept into her expression.  
“我也是，根本没在听。你有什么打发时间的主意吗？”明日香思考了一会儿，直到她的脸上慢慢浮现出一丝微笑。

_"Let's play a game!" “我们来玩游戏吧！”_

_"What kind of game?" “什么类型的游戏？”_

_"20 questions, gone wild!"_ Shinji's eyes widened to impossible sizes as he read the response. It was all she could do to not laugh out loud. After she'd received the affirmative from Shinji, she began their little game.  
“20 个问题，疯狂版！” 真嗣的眼睛瞪得大到不可思议，他读着回复。她尽力忍住不笑出声。在得到真嗣的肯定后，她开始了他们的小游戏。

_"Out of all the girls in the class, who's the cutest?"  
“在班上所有女生中，谁最可爱？”_

_"That's not a fair question..."  
"那问题不公平……"_

_"Answer the damn question, stupid Shinji!"  
"回答那个该死的问题，愚蠢的真嗣！"_

_"A certain fiery fräulein I know..."_ He had the audacity to look sheepish, but his comment made her happy. At least he had noticed she was an attractive organism of the female species. Pencil in his mouth, Shinji finally came up with a question that surprised her.  
""我认识的一位热情的女士……"" 他居然厚颜无耻地露出了尴尬的表情，但他的话让她感到高兴。至少他注意到了她是个有魅力的女性生物。嘴里叼着铅笔，真嗣终于想出了一个让她惊讶的问题。

_"Is there anyone that you like?"_ Her heartbeat flared as she struggled to find an immediate answer. She wasn't mentally ready to tell him that she liked him, but one wrong move and she could hint to Shinji that it wasn't him she liked, dashing her hopes of a future relationship entirely.  
"你有喜欢的人吗？" 她的心跳加速，努力寻找一个即时的答案。她还没准备好告诉他她喜欢他，但一旦说错话，就可能暗示给真嗣她喜欢的不是他，彻底粉碎了她对未来关系的希望。

_"If you mean like as in people I can bear with most on a daily basis, I'd have to choose you I guess."_ After sneaking him the note, she hid her face away from him, afraid she'd let slip her innermost thoughts. She heard a surprised gasp of air coming from his direction, before hearing the pencil scratching on the paper again.  
"如果你是指日常生活中我能忍受最多的人，我想我得选你吧。" 递给他纸条后，她把脸藏了起来，生怕泄露内心的真实想法。她听到他那边传来惊讶的吸气声，然后又听到铅笔在纸上划过的声音。

_"You write incredibly frustrating answers, I have no idea what that means in the female language."  
"你写的答案真是让人抓狂，我完全不懂这在女性语言里是什么意思。"_

She came close to whacking him across the head with her textbook, but settled with glaring at him as though looks could cause people to spontaneously combust.  
她差点用教科书敲他的头，但最终只是狠狠地瞪着他，仿佛眼神能让人自燃。

_"Read too much into it and I'll have you for lunch instead of the damn bento!"  
“别想太多，不然我可要把你当午餐吃了，而不是那该死的便当！”_

As soon as she handed it over, she regretted writing the response. She meant it as something angry, but replaying the words in her head and it began to sound... flirty? Her fears were confirmed when Shinji covered his mouth, trying not to laugh. Whimpering in exasperation, she buried her head in her arms on her desk. The rest of the day passed by in a slow, painful, agonizing fashion.  
她一递过去就后悔写了那个回复。本意是表达愤怒，但回想起来，那些话听起来...有点挑逗？当真嗣捂住嘴，努力不笑出声时，她的担忧得到了证实。她懊恼地呜咽一声，把头埋在桌上的手臂里。剩下的时间里，日子过得缓慢、痛苦且煎熬。
