"It's shocking how simple it is to tear the world apart, but rebuilding it, that isn't so easy." the older man mused. "I know," the boy replied, that weight in his chest a bit too heavy "I can't remember the last time I wasn't trying to fix it." (Bridge between NGE - Rebuild)  
“令人震惊的是，撕裂这个世界是多么简单，但重建它，就没那么容易了。”年长的男人沉思道。“我知道，”男孩回答，胸中的重担过于沉重，“我不记得上一次我没有试图修复它是什么时候了。”（《新世纪福音战士》与《福音战士新剧场版》之间的桥梁）

### Chapter 1: "...isn't this where?"

*Ahaaa* *啊哈*

That first breath always hurt. No matter how many times he took it.  
每一次呼吸的开始总是那么痛苦。无论他经历过多少次。

Darkness. 黑暗。

That was new. 这倒是新鲜。

Typically, he didn't wake up in darkness; he was more accustomed to the crash of a payphone, or the _very_ familiar white ceiling of the hospital wing.  
通常情况下，他不会在黑暗中醒来；他更习惯于公用电话的撞击声，或是医院病房那再熟悉不过的白色天花板。

If he was lucky, he'd get to wake up in his own bed, but those times were few and far between.  
如果他运气好，就能在自己的床上醒来，但这种时候少之又少。

_Calm. Stay calm. 冷静。保持冷静。_

He grappled through the darkness, not needing to stretch too far to find solid edges while a shiver ran through his body.  
他在黑暗中摸索，无需伸展太远就能触及坚实的边缘，同时一阵寒颤掠过全身。

_Cold. It was s_o damn cold.  
冷。真是他妈的冷。

Was it him, or was it this place?  
是他的错觉，还是这个地方本身就如此？

He couldn't stop his shivering, but he could tell the surface he was lying on was on a track, every movement he made rolled it forwards and backwards nearly an inch.  
他止不住地颤抖，但能感觉到身下的表面在轨道上，他每动一下，那东西就前后滚动近一英寸。

Reaching above him, there was no give to that frigid metal wall, but when he kicked and found that it moved ever so slightly, he figured that was enough.  
他伸手向上摸索，那冰冷的金属墙壁毫无弹性，但当他踢了一脚，发现它微微移动时，他觉得这已经足够了。

_*Bang * *砰 *_

_*Bang* *砰*_

_C'mon... 快点..._

_*Bang* *砰*_

Finally, it gave way. 终于，它让步了。

Pushing against the walls to move forward, the rollers brought him out into the warmer air.  
他推着墙壁向前移动，滚轮将他带入了更温暖的空气中。

_The boy couldn't recall ever waking up in a morgue before…  
这个男孩记不清自己以前是否曾在太平间里醒来过……_

"_It's too bad you had to wake up at all."_  
“你醒来真是太糟糕了。”

_That familiar figure was there again, leaning against a wall opposite of him and looking down at her bandaged hand. Ignoring her, he looked around and met the other pair of familiar eyes.  
那个熟悉的身影又出现了，斜倚在他对面的墙上，低头看着她包扎的手。他无视她，环顾四周，与另一双熟悉的眼睛相遇。_

That blue-haired figure was behind a pair of double doors leading out of the morgue, just watching him. One moment there and gone the next, he had long since abandoned the idea that he could rush up to her and talk, instead; he had resigned himself to his fate.  
那个蓝发身影站在通往停尸房外的双开门后，只是注视着他。一瞬间出现，下一刻又消失，他早已放弃了冲上去与她交谈的想法，而是接受了命运的安排。

Grabbing his arms, the boy shivered, looking around all he saw was a wall of stainless-steel doors and a few autopsy tables.  
男孩抓住他的手臂，颤抖着，环顾四周，只见一堵不锈钢门墙和几张解剖台。

Then he realized all he had was a towel for 'decency'.  
然后他意识到自己仅有的只是一条用来'遮羞'的毛巾。

Getting up he did the best to cover himself with the small cloth.  
他起身尽可能用这块小布料遮住自己。

*_Clink_* *叮当*

He looked down over the metal bed he had been laying on, on the floor a familiar Greek cross laid, seemingly having rested next to him without him realizing it.  
他低头看着自己躺在上面的金属床，地板上放着一个熟悉的希腊十字架，似乎在他不知不觉中一直躺在旁边。

As his feet touched the freezing floor, he held the towel over himself and picked up the worn piece of metal. His small fingers ran over its course and scratched surface, tracing the haphazardly retied string, he placed the pendant around his neck.  
当他的脚触碰到冰冷的地板时，他紧紧抓住毛巾遮住自己，并捡起了那块磨损的金属片。他纤细的手指沿着其粗糙的表面摸索，描绘着那随意重新系好的细绳，他将吊坠挂在了脖子上。

Taking a breath, the boy tried to calm his racing heart with the reminder of the familiar weight on his chest.  
男孩深吸一口气，试图用胸前熟悉的重量来平息自己狂跳的心。

Now it was time to move. There had to be a locker room around here somewhere.  
现在该行动了。这里某个地方一定有更衣室。

Two doors… 两扇门……

One a double doorway, the other a single, with no window.  
一扇是双开门，另一扇是单开门，没有窗户。

_Bingo 宾果_

He walked towards it, everything hurt, or perhaps more accuracy every fiber of his body was stiff. Joints popped as he walked, he could feel his knees and hips seem to grid at the simple task of walking. Even his head hurt, it easily made the top half in an already incredibly long list of painful activities he had endured, but that didn't really matter now.  
他朝它走去，全身疼痛，或许更准确地说，他身体的每一根纤维都僵硬了。关节在他行走时发出响声，他能感觉到膝盖和髋部在简单的行走任务中似乎在摩擦。甚至连他的头也疼，这轻易地排在了他已经经历过的无数痛苦活动的前半部分，但现在这并不重要。

Just as he was pushing the door open, there was shouting coming from beyond those double doors.  
正当他推开门时，从那两扇门后面传来了喊叫声。

Between all the rows of lockers and leftover clothing, he scrounged up an, albeit baggy, but matching NERV uniform, one that wouldn't immediately draw attention to him.  
在所有储物柜和遗留衣物的行列中，他翻找出一件，虽然宽松，但相配的 NERV 制服，一件不会立刻引起注意的制服。

Not that a lone 14-year-old wouldn't already attract attention here.  
并非一个 14 岁的独行少年在这里不会已经吸引注意。

Taking a separate door out, he found himself in one of the numerous nondescript hallways of NERV.  
他选择从另一扇门出去，发现自己身处 NERV 众多毫无特色的走廊之一。

If he could find a maintenance corridor, then he'd at least be able to at least get his bearings.  
如果他能找到一条维修走廊，那么至少能确定自己的方位。

Before he could dwell on the matter further, Shinji Ikari's thoughts would be cut short by a scream that would send him into a running panic.  
在他还没来得及深思之前，碇真嗣的思绪就被一声尖叫打断，这让他陷入了奔跑的恐慌。

ʡʘʢ

To his credit, he'd spent far less time in this part of the base, even if he'd been able to walk around here for a countless number of past lives.  
值得称赞的是，他在这部分基地停留的时间远比其他地方少，尽管他曾在无数前世中在这里自由行走。

Perhaps it was Lady Luck feeling bad about dropping him in (most definitely) a dead Shinji's body, that he was able to find an access hatch to the separate series of maintenance tunnels so fast.  
或许是幸运女神对他降临（毫无疑问）在一个已故真嗣的身体中感到愧疚，他才能如此迅速地找到通往独立维修隧道的入口舱门。

Or maybe it was fate.  
又或许，这就是命运。

Either way, he went about searching for a terminal.  
无论哪种方式，他开始寻找一个终端。

Shinji stood in the middle of the hallway, a cool breeze reminding him of the loose and quite thin clothes he was wearing, but it was a minor discomfort compared to  
真嗣站在走廊中央，一阵凉风让他意识到自己穿着宽松且相当单薄的衣服，但与接下来相比，这只是微不足道的不适。

This was a maintenance shaft that few workers ever ventured into, even during a direct attack on the GeoFront it was rarely used.  
这是一个很少有工人会涉足的维修通道，即使在直接攻击地表都市时也极少被使用。

There was one thing that Shinji needed right now, though, a single lonely terminal. The thing was so rarely used that he always had to clean the dust from the screen to see it properly.  
眼下，真嗣急需一样东西，一台孤零零的终端机。这玩意儿极少被使用，以至于他每次都得先清理屏幕上的灰尘才能看清。

One keystroke and he held his breath, the screen flickered to life, slowly, he might add, slower than he remembered.  
他敲下一个按键，屏息凝神，屏幕闪烁着亮起，缓慢地，他得说，比他记忆中的还要慢。

The NERV crest hung there, suspended on the black screen with two white bars beneath.  
NERV 的徽章悬挂在那里，在黑色屏幕上悬浮着，下方有两条白色横杠。

_USERNAME 用户名_

_PASSWORD 密码_

With the only sound that reverberated through the cold service shaft being his fingers running over the keyboard, Shinji entered in the admin username and password he had come to memorize. If he was honest, it was usually only good 50 percent of the time, so as he hit the enter key, he silently prayed to whatever deity had come to dictate his life.  
在冰冷的服务通道中，唯一回响的声音是他手指在键盘上滑动的声响，真嗣输入了他已熟记于心的管理员用户名和密码。老实说，这通常只有 50%的成功率，所以当他按下回车键时，他默默地向任何一位主宰他命运的神明祈祷。

_Please… 请…_

Who was he begging? Even he didn't know, throughout his travels, he couldn't attest to any higher deity, any supreme being, but that didn't stop him from pleading, and it made him feel better.  
他在向谁乞求？连他自己也不清楚，在他漫长的旅途中，他无法证明任何更高神祇或至高存在的存在，但这并未阻止他恳求，这让他感觉好些。

One keystroke and a swirling circle next to the credentials was all he could focus on now.  
一个按键，旁边的凭证旁旋转的圆圈，此刻他只能专注于这些。

It swirled, over and over and over, five, six, seven, eight seconds, that looping circle was almost hypnotizing, almost drawing him in.  
它旋转着，一圈又一圈，五秒、六秒、七秒、八秒，那个循环的圆圈几乎让人着迷，几乎要将他吸引进去。

_ACCEPTED 接受_

Those words almost startled the Third Children. Slowly the admin console came up, and his hands went to work.  
这些话几乎让第三适格者吃了一惊。慢慢地，管理控制台启动了，他的双手开始操作起来。

Muscle memory, even in this body that was his, but not his. His fingers danced across the keyboard every backdoor he ever needed, every alternate account that he could need, every exploit that would be hidden in layers of ambiguity to lie dormant through every patch and update, everything that could think he used or needed in the past spilled out in lines of code.  
肌肉记忆，即便在这具身体里，他既是，又非他。他的手指在键盘上翩翩起舞，每一个他曾需要的后门，每一个可能用到的备用账号，每一处潜藏在模糊层中的漏洞，它们在每次补丁和更新中蛰伏，所有他过去使用或需要的，都化作一行行代码流淌而出。

Now the hard part. 现在才是难点。

All this was useless without convincing something or depending on your perspective someone, or three someones.  
没有说服某物，或者从你的角度看，某人，或三个人，这一切都毫无用处。

Using dedicated backdoors that hadn't been used for years since the inception of the MAGI, he hesitated, as he always did, he never changed.  
利用自 MAGI 诞生以来多年未曾动用的专用后门，他犹豫了，一如既往，从未改变。

The keystrokes started again with a release of an unknowingly held breath.  
随着一声不自觉屏住的呼吸释放，敲击键盘的声音再次响起。

_**A word? 一个词？**_

ʡʘʢ

The three consciousnesses beamed at speeds no human could process information. Petabytes of information flowed through each of them, each artificial personality working perfectly in sync.  
三个意识以人类无法处理信息的速度闪耀着。每一份意识中都流淌着千万亿字节的信息，每个人工智能人格都完美同步地运作着。

"A word?" “一个词？”

The data was so small and inconsequential that it would have been easily missed by anything else. Only a few bytes to create those letters, but it was the source that was more interesting.  
数据如此微小且无关紧要，其他任何东西都很容易忽略它。仅用几个字节就能生成那些字母，但更引人注目的是它的来源。

**Admin Terminal** _Admin Terminal_ Admin Terminal  
管理终端 管理终端 管理终端

**Maintenance Shaft** _Maintenance Shaft_ Maintenance Shaft  
维修通道 维修通道 维修通道

**Question?… Agreed** _Question?… Agreed_ Question?… Agreed  
问题？……同意的问题？……同意的问题？……同意

_**Who? 谁？**_

Through the flow of data, the resources needed to answer this stranger were inconsequential to those needed to run and monitor Tokyo-3, so they indulged it, after all, it had an admin login that hadn't been used since their inception.  
通过数据流，回答这个陌生人的资源对于运行和监控东京-3 所需资源来说微不足道，所以他们放任了它，毕竟，它使用了一个自他们成立以来就未曾动过的管理员登录权限。

The three personalities were curious.  
这三种人格都感到好奇。

"Pilot" was the answer that came through.  
"飞行员"是传来的答案。

**Pilot?** _Pilot?_ Pilot? 飞行员？飞行员？飞行员？

They each searched through their data banks, each coming to the conclusion that there was only one pilot currently unaccounted for.  
他们各自查阅了数据库，最终都得出结论：目前只有一名驾驶员尚未被记录。

"_**3rd Children"**_ 「第三适格者」

**Steal Password?** _Play Prank?_ What gain?  
窃取密码？恶作剧？有何益处？

**Alive?** _How?_ Lier? 还活着？怎么可能？骗子？

"Yes" it responded. “是的”，它回应道。

**Why?** _Why? W_hy? 为什么？为什么？为什么？

"_**Why?"**_ “为什么？”

"I need help" “我需要帮助”

ʡʘʢ

This was Shinji Ikari. 这是碇真嗣。

Dressed in an oversize set of clothing, stumbling around in a maintenance passage…  
穿着一套过于宽大的衣服，在维修通道里跌跌撞撞……

Letting his feet carry him somewhere, anywhere.  
任由双脚带他去往某个地方，任何地方。

Thoughts, all racing through his head, the information he had gotten from the MAGI had been promising.  
思绪，全都争先恐后地涌入脑海，他从 MAGI 那里得到的信息曾一度充满希望。

It seemed like he'd landed somewhere that was similar to his first life, it was close enough that someone who hadn't been flung across time and space might think it matched.  
这地方与他前世颇为相似，相似到若非亲身穿越时空，旁人或许会以为两者如出一辙。

As someone who _had_ been flung across time and space, he begged to differ.  
但作为那个真正被抛掷于时空之外的人，他可不这么认为。

Now he was simply going to choose one of these doors and let himself be found, which one it didn't matter.  
如今，他只需随意选一扇门，任由命运引领他现身，选哪扇门都无关紧要。

What did matter is what he would say to Misato, now that he technically classified as a zombie.  
真正重要的是，他现在从技术上讲已经算是个僵尸了，该对美里说些什么。

ʡʘʢ

"Let me see him!" Misato practically screamed at the nurse, who in all fairness wasn't properly equipped to deal with such an irate Lieutenant Colonel.  
“让我见他！”美里几乎是对着护士尖叫，平心而论，这位护士并没有准备好应对如此愤怒的少校。

"His body is supposed to be left in isolation to decrease a risk from contamination." The nurse explained in the calmest voice she could muster.  
“他的身体应该被隔离，以降低污染风险。”护士尽可能平静地解释道。

"Contamination?! He was shot with a laser through his chest!"  
"污染？！他可是被激光穿胸而过！"

"Yes, but protocol is protocol."  
"是的，但规定就是规定。"

"Let me see his damn body, someone needs to!" she yelled while pushing past the nurse and trying in vain to push back tears.  
""让我看看他的该死的身体，总得有人这么做！"" 她一边喊着，一边推开护士，徒劳地试图忍住泪水。

"Lieutenant Colonel!" “中校！”

Misato didn't listen, she needed to see him; she needed to see that lifeless, cold body of the boy that she sent to die, the boy she had sent like a lamb to slaughter.  
美里没有听进去，她必须见到他；她需要亲眼看到那个她送上去送死的男孩的冰冷、毫无生气的尸体，那个她像待宰羔羊一样送走的男孩。

She could send men to die, she could send women to die, but a child…  
她可以派遣男人去死，她可以派遣女人去死，但一个孩子……

_Those screams… 那些尖叫声……_

Those sounds still echoed in her head; she couldn't remember hearing anything like them before.  
那些声音仍在她脑海中回响；她以前从未听过类似的声音。

Misato doubted she'd ever be able to sleep without seeing his face and hearing those sounds cutting into her ears again.  
美里怀疑自己永远无法在看到他的脸和再次听到那些声音刺入耳中后安然入睡。

Two seconds too slow, too damn paralyzed by the situation to even act.  
慢了整整两秒，被这局面吓得几乎动弹不得。

And his father… what a cold bastard.  
而他父亲……真是个冷酷无情的人。

Even as the Third Child was expedited back down to the GeoFront and people were shouting out orders, she knew in her heart that this was it.  
尽管第三适格者被迅速送回地表，人们纷纷下达指令，她心中明白，这一刻终于来临了。

No pulse, not even as they tried in vain to start his heart.  
没有脉搏，即便他们徒劳地试图重启他的心脏，也毫无反应。

Flatline. 心电图平直。

No vitals. 无生命迹象。

He was dead before they could even open the entry plug.  
在他们打开驾驶舱之前，他就已经死了。

Now it had been six hours, six hours of occupying her mind by concocting a plan to kill the Sixth Angel that was slowly digging towards them.  
如今已经过去了六个小时，六个小时里她绞尽脑汁，策划着如何杀死那只正缓慢向他们挖掘而来的第六使徒。

And now she was here, pushing her way into the morgue, during the closest thing she had to a break, and wanting to torture herself with the sight of his lifeless face.  
而现在，她却在这里，趁着她难得的休息时间，硬闯进太平间，想要用他那毫无生气的面容来折磨自己。

Only when she finally got through to the morgue, the nurse still hot her tail, all she found was an empty slab protruding from a wall of stainless steel.  
当她终于闯入太平间，护士紧追不舍，却发现那不锈钢墙壁上只留下一张空荡荡的床板。

The nurse's scream did more to help her back into the moment than anything else could right now.  
护士的尖叫声比任何事物此刻更能将她拉回现实。

Contamination? What was this?  
污染？这是什么情况？

All she could be sure of was that she was going to need a _lot_ of alcohol if they survived this.  
她唯一能确定的是，如果他们能挺过这一劫，她将需要大量的酒精。

ʡʘʢ

They found him in the GeoFront, or at least that was what she was told.  
他们在地底都市找到了他，至少她是这么被告知的。

A million questions flowed through her mind at that moment, though she couldn't think of anything good she could say to the boy.  
那一刻，无数问题涌入她的脑海，但她却想不出任何合适的话对那个男孩说。

First, she just had to see him alive.  
首先，她只是必须确认他还活着。

There he was, one Shinji Ikari, colorful and breathing.  
他就在那里，碇真嗣，色彩鲜明且呼吸着。

Two Section 2 personal stood nearby, simply watching the boy, though when they saw the Lieutenant Colonel simply wave them away, they took their leave.  
两名第二课人员站在附近，只是注视着那个男孩，但当他们看到中校只是挥手让他们离开时，他们便离开了。

She stood in front of him, sitting on a bench, with his head down, hair in every direction, and a mismatched set of fatigues.  
她站在他面前，他坐在长椅上，头低垂着，头发乱七八糟，穿着一套不搭配的迷彩服。

For coming back from the dead, the boy looked just fine.  
从死里复活，这孩子看起来倒是挺好的。

And she couldn't help herself, she knelt down and grabbed the Third Child, pulling him into a tighter embrace than she ever thought herself capable of.  
她情不自禁地跪了下来，抓住了这位第三适格者，将他紧紧拥入怀中，力度之大超乎她以往的想象。

"I'm sorry Shinji." She said, despite the constant change in her voice from her desperate attempt to keep back tears.  
"对不起，真嗣。" 她尽管声音不断变化，却仍竭力忍住泪水说道。

"Um…" "呃…"

"I should have gotten you down faster, I should have…"  
"我本该更快把你救下来的，我应该…"

"Misato?" "美里？"

She pulled back and looked at the boy, a confused face plastered there for her to see.  
她后退一步，凝视着男孩，那张脸上满是困惑，清晰地呈现在她眼前。

"Yeah?" she said, still blinking back tears.  
“嗯？”她应道，泪水仍在眼眶中打转。

"What's going on?" he asked, in the most casual 'idontknowwhatishappeneing' voice.  
"发生什么事了？" 他用最随意的'我不知道发生了什么'的语气问道。

The woman took a deep breath.  
女人深吸了一口气。

_You can do this Misato.  
美里，你能做到的。_

"You were declared dead when we got you back down to the EVA hangars." she said softly, as if those words alone could make the child in front of her die again.  
“当我们把你带回 EVA 格纳库时，你已经被宣告死亡了。”她轻声说道，仿佛这些话本身就能让面前的孩子再次死去。

The boy just blinked. 男孩只是眨了眨眼。

"You've been dead for six hours Shinji."  
"你已经死了六个小时了，真嗣。"

He blinked again. 他再次眨了眨眼。

"I guess I didn't kill that Angel then…" he said, dejected.  
"看来我没杀掉那个天使……" 他沮丧地说。

"We have a plan for that, it'll be fine. Rei can help you catch up on it."  
"我们对此有计划，会没事的。丽可以帮你补上。"

"Rei's being sent out?" he asked, disbelief lining his voice.  
"丽被派出去了？" 他问道，声音中带着难以置信。

"Of course, why not?" "当然，为什么不呢？"

"I mean, the whole point of me piloting that robot was because of how badly she's hurt."  
"我的意思是，我驾驶那个机器人的全部原因就是因为她伤得那么重。"

Now it was Misato's turn to blink.  
现在轮到美里眨眼了。

"Shinji," she said slowly, "what's the last thing you remember?"  
“真嗣，”她缓缓说道，“你记得的最后一件事是什么？”

He frowned, closing his eyes, "Um, I'm shooting up that shaft, and when I got up to the city…." He trailed off, his face contorting in an attempt to remember, "That thing was there, it had the shape of a person, but it wasn't, that was my target, right?"  
他皱起眉头，闭上眼睛，“嗯，我正朝那通道开枪，当我到达城市时……”他话音渐弱，面部扭曲着试图回忆，“那东西在那儿，它有着人的形状，但并非人类，那正是我的目标，对吧？”

Misato's eyes widened; this was not good.  
美里瞪大了眼睛；这可不妙。

"Shinji, was that right after I brought you here?"  
"真嗣，那是我带你来这里之后的事吗？"

The teen just nodded slowly.  
少年只是缓缓地点了点头。

"Shinji that was months ago."  
“真嗣，那是几个月前的事了。”

### Chapter 2: "…pulling the puzzles apart…"

Gendo Ikari was a patient man.  
碇源堂是个有耐心的人。

Gendo Ikari was a methodical man.  
碇源堂是个有条理的人。

Gendo Ikari was a rational man.  
碇源堂是个理性的人。

Gendo Ikari was not ready for this situation.  
碇源堂还没准备好面对这种情况。

"Are you going to look at your son's body?"  
“你打算看你儿子的遗体吗？”

Kōzō Fuyutsuki was a cool-headed, pragmatic man, after all, he was the right hand of the commander of NERV, but even he had a breaking point when it came to his boss' emotional distance.  
冬月耕造是个冷静、务实的人，毕竟他是 NERV 指挥官的得力助手，但即便如此，面对上司的情感疏离，他也有忍无可忍的时候。

Gendo said nothing, only looking forward from his desk, fingers intertwined in front of his face.  
碇源堂一言不发，只是从办公桌前直视前方，手指交叉在脸前。

"He. Was. _Your_. Son." Kōzō said deliberately trying to get his man to feel something.  
“他。是。你。的。儿。子。”冬月刻意强调，试图让对方感受到些什么。

"He. Was. _Yui's_. Son." He almost cringed as he used her name, it felt like such a low blow against the man.  
"他. 是. 结. 的. 儿子。" 他说出她的名字时几乎感到一阵畏缩，这感觉像是对这个男人的沉重打击。

Those glasses shifted in the light; the bearded man's head tilted up.  
那副眼镜在灯光下闪烁；留着胡须的男子抬起头来。

He could tell it affected him… good. After six hours of him staring into the distance in this office, it was the only thing that _had_ affected him.  
他看得出这影响了他……很好。在这间办公室里，他盯着远方长达六小时，这是唯一能触动他的事情。

"Are you just going to sit there and pretend that Yui's boy isn't currently occupying a spot in our morgue?"  
“你就打算坐在那儿，假装唯的儿子现在没占着我们停尸房的一个位置吗？”

Gendo didn't turn his head, but Kōzō knew he was starting to wear away that impregnable wall.  
碇没有转头，但荒巻知道他正开始瓦解那堵坚不可摧的墙。

Walking around the desk so he was not in front of his superior, the older man placed his hands on the overly large desk.  
老者绕过桌子，确保自己不在上司面前，然后将双手放在那张过于庞大的办公桌上。

"I remember the first time she showed me him, she handed him to me without hesitation and…" he stopped, words catching in his throat, dammit. He didn't know the boy, but he knew Yui and what she had been willing to do for him.  
“我记得她第一次把他展示给我看的时候，她毫不犹豫地把他递给了我，然后……”他顿住了，话语哽在喉咙里，该死。他不认识那个男孩，但他了解 Yui，以及她为了他愿意做的一切。

Now… that last true reminiscence of her was gone. That flame extinguished from this world, leaving it that that much darker, that much colder.  
现在……她最后的真实回忆也消失了。那火焰从这个世界上熄灭，让这个世界变得更加黑暗，更加寒冷。

The seated man looked up at him, his eyes were blank, empty, but in more pain, than Fuyutsuki ever thought he had seen them in, somehow he doubted it was due to the current status of Unit-01's pilot.  
坐在那里的男人抬头看着他，他的眼睛空洞无神，但痛苦之深，是 Fuyutsuki 从未见过的，不知为何，他怀疑这与 01 号机驾驶员的现状无关。

"Quarantine is…" "隔离是……"

"DAMN THE QUARANTINE!" the gray-haired professor yelled as he slammed his fist down on the desk of his superior. "You owe it to Yui." The elderly man pointed to Gendo.  
"该死的隔离！" 灰白头发的教授怒吼着，一拳砸在他上司的桌子上。"你欠唯一个交代。" 老人指向碇。

Those cold distant eyes lit up at those words. Finally, Fuyutsuki knew he'd gotten to him.  
那双冰冷遥远的眼睛因这些话而亮了起来。终于，冬月知道他触动了他。

Slowly rising from his seat, Gendo placed his hands on the desk, mirroring the old professor.  
缓缓从座位上站起，源堂将双手放在桌上，模仿着那位老教授的动作。

"Listen to me…" “听我说……”

Whatever retort Gendo was about to delve into was eviscerated into oblivion with the crashing of doors and hurried footsteps rapidly approaching the two men.  
无论源堂即将展开何种反驳，都被突如其来的门板撞击声和急促的脚步声彻底打断，这些声音正迅速向两人逼近。

A random nurse rushed across the long office, unannounced, and was now sucking down more air than a turbofan at cruising speed.  
一位不知名的护士匆匆穿过长长的办公室，未经通报，此刻正大口吸气，仿佛一架巡航中的涡轮风扇发动机。

"Not. Now." The commander growled.  
“现在不行。”指挥官咆哮道。

"Sir," “长官，”

"Not. _NOW_." He snarled again, lacking any of his characteristic coolness.  
"现在不行。" 他再次咆哮，失去了往常的冷静。

Before he could chastise the nurse anymore she blurted out her message.  
在他能继续责备护士之前，她急忙说出了消息。

"The Third Child is alive!"  
"第三子还活着！"

Time seemed to freeze at that moment for the old man, six hours since having him declared dead, six hours since his heart wouldn't start, six hours since no brainwaves or any vital signs could be found.  
那一刻，时间仿佛为老人凝固了，自他被宣告死亡已过去六小时，自他的心脏停止跳动已过去六小时，自脑电波和任何生命迹象消失已过去六小时。

Six hours on ice in a morgue, and the boy was alive.  
在太平间冰冻了六小时，那男孩却奇迹般地活了过来。

Yui's boy was alive. 结衣的孩子活过来了。

That tiny flame had survived somehow, pushing away that darkness again.  
那微弱的火焰不知怎地竟存活了下来，再次驱散了周围的黑暗。

"Leave us." the younger of the two commanded, causing the nurse to scurry back towards the door, only her footsteps on the smooth floor signaling she was still there before the crash of the door announced her exit.  
“离开我们。”两人中较年轻的那位命令道，护士随即快步走向门口，只有她鞋底在光滑地板上的摩擦声表明她还在那里，直到门砰的一声关上，宣告她的离去。

They stood there for a long while, it seemed like each was daring the other to speak.  
他们站在那里许久，仿佛都在挑战对方先开口。

Kōzō only could recall a few times this had happened, each one a more unpleasant event than the last, but here they were doing it at perhaps the one event they should be celebrating.  
高藏只能回忆起几次这种情况发生，每一次都比上一次更不愉快，但此刻他们却在这种或许本应庆祝的场合上重蹈覆辙。

"Thoughts?" the professor asked calmly, his voice a stark contrast to the tension between them only moments before.  
“想法？”教授平静地问道，他的声音与片刻前他们之间的紧张气氛形成鲜明对比。

Slowly Gendo sat back down into his seat, his eyes no longer fixed on the older man in front of him.  
慢慢地，源渡重新坐回座位，他的目光不再紧盯着面前那位年长者。

"I want you to investigate, see that this isn't some form of contamination, report to me exactly what you find."  
"我要你去调查一下，确认这不是某种污染，把你的发现详细报告给我。"

No shouts of joy, no professions of faith, not even a smile. Kōzō couldn't remember the last time he saw that man smile, with the idea he couldn't even smile at the thought of his son seemingly being resurrected to their plane of existence, well…  
没有欢呼，没有信仰的宣言，甚至连一个微笑都没有。Kōzō 记不清上次看到那个人微笑是什么时候了，想到他甚至无法在儿子似乎复活到他们这个世界的念头面前露出笑容，嗯……

Perhaps he would never see that man smile.  
也许他永远也看不到那个人微笑了。

ʡʘʢ

Misato couldn't really explain how she had ended up holding the boy, it just happened.  
美里无法真正解释她是如何最终抱着这个男孩的，事情就这么发生了。

There in the GeoFront, they both sat on the bench where they had found him, with her almost absorbing Shinji with her embrace.  
在 GeoFront 里，他们俩坐在找到他的长椅上，她几乎是用拥抱将真嗣包裹起来。

Perhaps it was some sort of motherly instincts, after all this boy was the closest thing she had to a son, even if it was a bit strange, maybe it was herself acting like an older sister, emphasis on older.  
或许这是一种母性本能，毕竟这个男孩是她最接近儿子的存在，尽管这有点奇怪，也许她表现得像个大姐姐，重点在于“大”。

Either way she was gripping him in her arms like he would melt away like this was some sort of dream-state that could collapse at any moment and she would wake back up at her desk. Only she would be filling out paperwork caused by his death.  
无论怎样，她紧紧拥抱着他，仿佛他随时会像梦境般消融，这个状态随时可能崩溃，她又会回到办公桌前。只是那时，她将填写因他死亡而产生的文件。

She tried to ask him about it, but he didn't know anything, or at least that's what he told her. She wasn't blind and it wasn't too surprising that someone like Shinji would hide things, he hid things from her before all this.  
她试图询问他，但他一无所知，或者至少他是这么告诉她的。她并非视而不见，像真嗣这样的人会隐藏事情并不令人意外，他在这一切发生之前就对她有所隐瞒。

But even though she sensed he wasn't telling her everything she was too caught up in the happiness of him being alive to even question him.  
尽管她感觉到他没有说出全部真相，但她沉浸在他生还的喜悦中，甚至无暇质疑他。

She just kept imagining this cold, pale corpse in the morgue the entire time she spent putting off to go see it and the whole time she took to go see that lifeless boy, now he was here in her arms, alive, warm, with color and a heartbeat.  
她一直想象着太平间里那具冰冷、苍白的尸体，拖延着不去看它，以及去看那个毫无生气的男孩的整个过程中，现在他却活生生地在她怀里，温暖、有血色，还有心跳。

She checked from time to time, just to be sure.  
她时不时地检查一下，只是为了确认。

The only thing that really seemed wrong apart from his apparent lack of memory was his hoarse voice, no doubt from screaming in pain.  
除了他明显的记忆缺失外，唯一真正不对劲的就是他沙哑的声音，毫无疑问是因为痛苦中的尖叫。

Shinji could remember the journey to get to NERV, the N2 blast that nearly killed them, even his amazement at the GeoFront he remembered.  
真嗣能记得前往 NERV 的旅程，那几乎夺去他们生命的 N2 炸弹爆炸，以及他对 GeoFront 的惊叹。

After the decision to pilot Unit-01 and him reaching the surface, that was when his memories got… scattered.  
在决定驾驶初号机并到达地面之后，他的记忆就开始……变得零散。

So, she told him, she explained to him how he had defeated the Fourth Angel and how he had moved in with her. How he had gone to school and made friends and how he killed the Fifth with those same boys in the entry plug.  
于是，她告诉他，她向他解释了他是如何击败第四使徒，如何搬去和她一起住。他是如何去上学、交朋友，以及如何与那些男孩们在插入栓中一起击杀了第五使徒。

Then she had to work herself up to tell him what happened.  
然后她不得不鼓起勇气告诉他发生了什么。

"We sent you up to fight the Sixth Angel, but it must have known…" she stopped herself, steadying her voice.  
“我们派你去对抗第六使徒，但它一定早就知道了……”她顿住了，稳住自己的声音。

"It cooked the EVA with you inside. You flat-lined before we even got the entry plug open and nothing could get you back…" she couldn't meet his eyes, the shame of her hesitation forcing her to look away.  
“它把你和 EVA 一起煮熟了。在我们打开插入栓之前你就心跳停止了，我们什么也做不了……”她无法直视他的眼睛，犹豫带来的羞愧感迫使她移开了视线。

She stopped, closing her eyes she could only think about that screaming, how it echoed in her ears painfully, and how it had drowned out every noise in the command station…  
她停了下来，闭上眼睛，满脑子都是那尖叫声，它在耳边痛苦地回响，淹没了指挥站里的所有噪音……

And then it just stopped, replaced by warnings about pilot vitals.  
然后尖叫声戛然而止，取而代之的是关于飞行员生命体征的警告。

"I'm sorry." She whispered.  
“对不起。”她低声说道。

"Why?" “为什么？”

"I failed you." "我辜负了你。"

She looked at the boy, trying to find some sign of forgiveness in those eyes. She needed to say that to ask for forgiveness.  
她看着那个男孩，试图在那双眼睛里找到一丝宽恕的迹象。她需要说出这句话来请求原谅。

"I failed you as a commander…"  
"作为指挥官，我辜负了你……"

The boy in her arms just blinked, confusion contorting his face.  
她怀里的男孩只是眨了眨眼，困惑扭曲了他的脸。

"Did you know the Angel would do that?" he said in a surprisingly calm voice.  
“你知道天使会那样做吗？”他用一种出奇平静的声音说道。

"No," she replied half-heartily, looking out at the GeoFront, "but that doesn't excuse my lack of action, I hesitated, and you died."  
“不知道，”她半心半意地回答，望向 GeoFront，“但这并不能为我的不作为开脱，我犹豫了，而你死了。”

.

.

.

"You don't need to apologize…" he started, pausing to make sure she was looking back at him "but if it makes you feel better..."  
"你不需要道歉……" 他开口说道，停顿了一下确保她在看着他，"但如果你觉得这样会好受些……"

"It's alright," he said with a small smile.  
"没关系，" 他带着一丝微笑说道。

She felt a massive weight pull off her shoulder, but at the same time she also felt a massive sense of guilt crashing down on her, how could he forgive her so easily, it wasn't fair.  
她感到肩上的重担被卸下了，但同时又感到一股巨大的愧疚感压了下来，他怎么能这么轻易地原谅她，这不公平。

He should be screaming at her, demanding answers, belittling her for her incompetence.  
他本该对她大吼大叫，追问答案，因她的无能而贬低她。

At the same time, a part of her clung to that acceptance, a guilty part of her and she found herself gripping the child even tighter.  
与此同时，她内心的一部分紧紧抓住了这份接纳，那是她愧疚的一部分，她发现自己不由得将孩子抱得更紧了。

"I guess you have a plan for that thing?" Shinji asked softly changing the subject.  
“我想你已经有计划对付那东西了吧？” 真嗣轻声问道，转移了话题。

She was a bit unnerved by his nonchalant way of changing the subject, even more at his apparent desire to get back out there.  
他轻描淡写地转移话题，让她有些不安，更令她惊讶的是他似乎急切地想回到外面。

"Yeah, but are you sure you want to go back out there?."  
“是啊，但你确定真的要回到外面去吗？”

Shinji slowly nodded "Imagine you woke up in a morgue just to find out you died and lost two months of your memory..."  
“想象一下，你在太平间醒来，发现自己死了，还失去了两个月的记忆……”真嗣缓缓点头说道。

"I bet you think it's easy for us down here, under so many plates of armor..."  
"我敢打赌，你以为对我们来说，在这么多层盔甲下生活很容易..."

"A bit." He replied with more than a hint of annoyance in his voice.  
"有点。" 他的回答中带着一丝不悦。

"Then let me show you why you're going up there."  
"那么让我告诉你为什么你要上去。"

ʡʘʢ

Shinji had never been taken by Misato to the lowest parts of the Central Dogma.  
真嗣从未被美里带到中央教条的最底层。

Instead, he typically had to 'learn' about it the hard way.  
相反，他通常只能通过艰难的方式‘学习’这些知识。

This time she practically dragged him, hand in hand, down to the lowest depths of the base, places he could only remember being when a crisis necessitated it.  
这一次，她几乎是拽着他，手牵手，一路下到基地的最深处，那些地方他只有在危机时刻才记得去过。

It was a bit of a surreal experience, these unfamiliar corridors with the only sounds apart from the humming of machines being their shoes on the floor.  
这是一段略显超现实的经历，这些陌生的走廊里，除了机器的嗡嗡声，唯一的声音就是他们的鞋底摩擦地板的声响。

Misato pulled out her key card to enter into a secure room, the green NERV logo indicating her clearance was high enough.  
美里掏出她的钥匙卡，准备进入一个安全房间，绿色的 NERV 标志表明她的权限足够高。

Shinji's face showed very real surprise at the sight of the white humanoid, arms pinned, and lifeless eyes staring.  
看到那白色人形生物被钉住的双臂和无神的双眼，真嗣的脸上露出了非常真实的惊讶。

Lilith hung there; an entanglement of white legs protruded from the lower half of its' torso. Shinji stared at it, wide at the Spear of Longinus protruding from the humanoid and how it had already been brought back to NERV HQ.  
莉莉丝悬挂在那里；下半身缠绕着白色的腿。真嗣瞪大了眼睛，注视着朗基努斯之枪从人形生物体内穿出，以及它如何已经被带回了 NERV 总部。

_If Misato knows about Lilith…  
如果美里知道莉莉丝的事……_

_Does she know about the Human Instrumentality Project as well? Is she working towards the Third Impact here?  
她是否也了解人类补完计划？她在这里是为了促成第三次冲击吗？_

"What you're seeing is the origin of all life on this planet, as well as the key to its end. The Second Ange… Lilith."  
“你所见到的是这颗星球上所有生命的起源，也是其终结的关键。第二使徒……莉莉丝。”

"It's the trigger that will set off the Third Impact, we have to protect Lilith…" she explained.  
“这是引发第三次冲击的触发器，我们必须保护莉莉丝……”她解释道。

Shinji eyed the woman, she seemed to stare a second too long at the massive humanoid before continuing.  
真嗣打量着那位女子，她似乎对那庞大的类人形生物多凝视了一瞬，才继续前行。

Turning to him she knelt down to his level "That's what the EVAs are for, that's why NERV exists."  
她转向他，跪下与他平视，“这就是 EVA 存在的意义，也是 NERV 存在的理由。”

_If only she knew the irony of that statement…  
如果她知道那句话的讽刺意味就好了……_

"It's not fair Shinji," she said, her eyes falling to the floor "it's not fair that we have to ask you to pilot the EVAs, but if one of the Angels were able to breach the GeoFront and get down here to central dogma..."  
"真嗣，这不公平，" 她说道，目光垂向地板，"我们不得不请求你驾驶 EVA，但如果有一个使徒能够突破 GeoFront 并到达这里的中枢教条……"

"So why me, why..." Shinji asked, not only to mask his knowledge but to see if she knew his importance.  
"那为什么是我，为什么……" 真嗣问道，不仅是为了掩饰自己的了解，还想看看她是否知道他的重要性。

"There is no why that destiny happened to be yours', that's all." Misato's lips curled into a sad smile.  
“命运降临于你，没有为什么’，仅此而已。”美里嘴角勾起一抹苦笑。

Shinji looked at the woman, either she was a good liar, or she had no clue about Rei's true purpose and his mother's fate. Either way, he learned more than he had hoped, and it wasn't like he was about to say no.  
真嗣看着这位女性，她要么是个高明的骗子，要么对绫波的真实目的和他母亲的命运一无所知。无论如何，他了解到的比期望的更多，而且他也不可能拒绝。

After all, he had a promise to keep.  
毕竟，他有一个承诺要遵守。

"Alright, I'll do it." “好吧，我来做。”

"You don't have to do it alone Shinji, you'll have us." She leaned in and wrapped him in a hug, "You'll have me the whole time…"  
“你不必独自承担，真嗣，我们会在你身边。”她靠近并紧紧拥抱他，“我会一直陪着你……”

"What about Rei?" "丽怎么样？"

"She'll be there right next to you."  
"她会就在你身边。"

### Chapter 3: "…we spoke of was and when…"

Kōzō Fuyutsuki could admit he hated the sterile smell of hospitals; the medical wing was no different. Though to be fair it wasn't as if these places were well regarded by the general populace, to begin with.  
冬月耕造不得不承认，他讨厌医院那股消毒水的味道；医疗翼也不例外。不过公平地说，这些地方从一开始就不受大众欢迎。

That being said, he couldn't say he even noticed the smell right now, not standing in front of this boy that he knew was dead.  
话虽如此，他现在站在一个他知道已经死去的男孩面前，根本没注意到那股气味。

_Had_ been dead, he corrected himself.  
他本已死去，他纠正自己。

Yet here the boy was, sitting on the exam table, shirt off, skin full of color, and breathing.  
然而此刻，那男孩就坐在检查台上，衬衫脱下，肤色红润，呼吸着。

Breathing... 呼吸着……

If he were still a religious man, he'd consider it a miracle.  
如果他还是个虔诚的信徒，他会认为这是个奇迹。

But in this world, with everything he'd seen and every sin he had been an accomplice to, he could hardly say he'd held those beliefs in quite some time.  
但在这个世界上，经历了他所见的一切和参与的每一场罪行后，他早已无法再说自己还持有那些信仰。

"I'd like to ask you some questions." The grey-haired man asked the young boy.  
“我想问你几个问题。”灰白头发的男人对小男孩说。

The nurse who had done a full check-up on him had swiftly vacated the room when he arrived, and the sub-commander was sure that she wouldn't intrude on them until he left.  
为他做了全面检查的护士在他到达后迅速离开了房间，副指挥官确信在她离开之前，她不会打扰他们。

Lt. Colonel Katsuragi had left to see to her plan of harnessing the entire Japanese power grid to pierce the AT field of the Sixth Angel. Now it was just the boy and him.  
葛城美里中校已经离开，去实施她利用整个日本电网穿透第六使徒 AT 力场的计划。现在只剩下这个男孩和他了。

The Third Child nodded in agreement to his question.  
第三适格者对他的问题点头表示同意。

Kōzō pulled up a chair that had been situated next to the door, the exam rooms were much smaller than some of the other rooms in the medical wing and they didn't have the luxury of a window either.  
Kōzō拉过一把靠在门边的椅子，检查室比医疗翼的其他房间小得多，也没有窗户的奢侈。

He looked at the boy seated at nearly eye level, the man could spot the child's mother's features in his face, though much of it was overshadowed by his father. The older man assumed that as the boy grew into a man he'd see far less of his mother and more of his father every time he looked at him.  
他看着坐在几乎与他视线齐平的男孩，男人的目光在孩子的脸上捕捉到了他母亲的特征，尽管大部分都被父亲的特点所掩盖。这位年长者推测，随着男孩成长为男人，每次看他时，他会看到越来越少母亲的影子，而越来越多父亲的影子。

But those eyes were different from either of them, they lacked the compassion of Yui's. Even after the Second Impact, Shinji's mother had a way of lightening whichever room she was in. Kōzō couldn't help but feel envious of his former student's optimism, he knew it wasn't out of her naivety, she was much too smart for that he was sure.  
但那双眼睛与他们中的任何一个都不同，它们缺少了 Yui 的同情心。即使在第二次冲击之后，Shinji 的母亲总有一种让所在房间变得明亮的魔力。Kōzō不禁对这位前学生的乐观感到羡慕，他知道这并非出于她的天真，他确信她聪明得足以避免那种天真。

Shinji's eyes weren't like his father's either, however, neither before nor after Yui's death. Gendo Ikari had always seemed cold and distant, it just happened to become worse after his wife's death as she had been the only one who had been able to break through that icy exterior.  
然而，真嗣的眼睛也不像他父亲的，无论是在唯去世前还是去世后。源堂·碇总是显得冷漠而疏远，只是在妻子去世后，这种情况变得更加严重，因为她是唯一能打破那冰冷外表的人。

The elderly professor had to admit he hadn't interacted much with the boy, apparently, he was a meek, timid boy, an extreme introvert, but those eyes…  
这位年长的教授不得不承认，他与这个男孩的交流并不多，显然，他是一个温顺、胆小的孩子，极度内向，但那些眼睛……

They didn't match the person listen in his file. They blazed with life while still being cold and collected, they were hollow, yet capable of boring into you. They looked much too old for a child, though he could expect dying had something to do with it.  
它们与档案中描述的那个人并不相符。它们充满生机却又冷静自持，空洞无物，却能深深地洞察你。对于一个孩子来说，它们显得过于沧桑，尽管他可以预料到死亡与此有关。

Most importantly, they were examining _him_ with razor focus, it was almost like Gendo's eyes on something new, looking for ways to exploit some new information. Kōzō couldn't help but think Shinji doing the very same thing to him.  
最重要的是，他们正以锐利的目光审视着他，几乎像是源堂在审视某种新事物，寻找利用新信息的方法。高藏不禁觉得真嗣也在对他做同样的事情。

The same way a lion looked at something, unsure of its' intentions, thinking about whether it should dismiss it… or tear it to pieces.  
就像狮子看待某个对象一样，不确定其意图，思考是该忽视它……还是将其撕成碎片。

"The doctors informed me that you're having trouble recalling events?"  
“医生告诉我，你在回忆事件上有困难？”

The boy blinked. 男孩眨了眨眼。

"Um, I sort of remember the Sixth Angel, but," his shoulders slumped "After that, I can't really recall much."  
“呃，我好像记得第六使徒，但是，”他的肩膀耷拉下来，“在那之后，我真记不太清了。”

That bravado that he had seen in the boy's eyes seemed to disappear… how strange. Perhaps he was a bit like his father after all.  
他曾在男孩眼中看到的那股勇敢似乎消失了……真奇怪。或许他终究还是有点像他父亲。

"Nothing about dying, before or after that experience?" he pried a bit further.  
"关于死亡，在那次经历之前或之后，有什么特别的感受吗？" 他进一步追问。

Shinji shook his head. 真嗣摇了摇头。

"I don't know, I just woke up in a freezer down in the Morgue."  
"我不知道，我只是在一个冰柜里醒来，就在太平间的下面。"

"Speaking of which…" Kōzō changed to his next point "Why did you run out of the morgue?"  
"说到这个…" 高雄转换了话题，"你为什么从停尸间跑出来？"

Shinji just sat there, not answering.  
真嗣只是坐在那里，没有回答。

"You sent this base into quite a panic, someone presumed dead after fighting an Angel? They could have been contaminated."  
"你让这个基地陷入了一场不小的恐慌，有人在与使徒战斗后被认定死亡？他们可能已经被污染了。"

He looked up at the former professor.  
他抬头看向那位前教授。

"Do you think I'm contaminated sir?"  
“您觉得我被污染了吗，先生？”

His old joints groaned as he shrugged "I don't know, that's why we gave you a checkup, that's why we need to see if you can still sync with Unit 01 after this."  
他老迈的关节在耸肩时发出吱嘎声，“我不知道，所以我们才给你做了检查，我们需要确认你在这之后是否还能与初号机同步。”

"Running like that, after me explaining this to you, you may see why we're interested in your behavior." The man elaborated.  
“像这样跑掉，在我向你解释之后，你或许能明白我们为何对你的行为感兴趣。”男人进一步解释道。

The fourteen-year-old frowned "How would you feel?"  
十四岁的少年皱眉道：“你会怎么想？”

Kōzō looked at the boy who looked back down to his hands, flexing them, curling them.  
Kōzō看着那个男孩，男孩低头看向自己的双手，弯曲着，握紧又松开。

"I woke up in a _morgue_, after fighting some monster in a giant robot… what exactly would you have done? Lay there and freeze to death?"  
"我在一个停尸房醒来，之前还驾驶着巨型机器人与某种怪物战斗……你倒是说说，我还能怎么办？躺在那儿冻死吗？""

"You evaded security for quite some time." Kōzō responded.  
"你躲避安保系统相当长一段时间了。" 高藏回应道。""

"I don't know this place." Shinji said, gesturing to the base around him "What do you want from me? It's lucky I even made it to the GeoFront, I bet I could have gotten lost for days down here."  
"我不熟悉这个地方。" 真嗣指着周围的基地说，"你到底想从我这里得到什么？能到达地表下层已经是万幸了，我敢打赌，我可能在这里迷路好几天。""

Kōzō had to begrudgingly agree with that point, it wasn't as if this base was exactly friendly to incoming staff.  
高雄不得不勉强同意这一点，这个基地对新来的员工确实不怎么友好。

"Do you remember anything happening? Do you have any memory between getting into Unit-01 and the Sixth Angel?"  
“你记得发生过什么事吗？你有没有任何从进入初号机到第六使徒之间的记忆？”

The boy closed his eyes like he was recalling any memory he had.  
男孩闭上眼睛，仿佛在回忆他所拥有的任何记忆。

"Screaming," he breathed "and pain."  
"尖叫声，" 他喘息着，"还有疼痛。"

Opening his eyes, he looked at the man "I can't say which fight it was."  
他睁开眼睛，看着那人，"我无法确定是哪一场战斗。"

Those eyes seemed to transform back into the ones that the professor had initially seen.  
那双眼睛似乎又变回了教授最初见到的那双。

How interesting. 真是有趣。

Kōzō just nodded and stood up.  
高造只是点了点头，站起身来。

"I can't say I'm satisfied with these answers, but I'm willing to say you're not satisfied as well."  
“我不能说我对你这些回答感到满意，但我愿意说你也不满意。”

The Third Child nodded slowly.  
第三适格者缓缓点头。

Reaching out he put his hand on the boy's shoulder "We'll need you for this plan Shinji. If we get through tonight, I think you'll be surprised at what kind of life you've had in the last 2 months."  
他伸出手，放在男孩的肩上，“我们需要你参与这个计划，真嗣。如果我们能挺过今晚，我想你会对自己过去两个月的经历感到惊讶。”

Turning to leave Kozo was stopped by the boy's voice.  
转身欲离时，却被男孩的声音叫住。

"I guess the commander didn't find any reason to see me."  
"我想指挥官没找到见我的理由。"

Kozo cringed at the fact that was more of a statement.  
小津听到这话更像是个陈述，不禁皱了皱眉。

And a true one. 而且是个事实。

"Your father is working his connections to see to Lt. Colonel Katsuragi's plan, he grieved in his own way before the news of your… condition came to him."  
"你父亲正在利用他的人脉来支持上校桂木的计划，他在得知你……状况的消息前，以自己的方式哀悼。"

It was a lie, but Kōzō could freely admit that the world ran on white lies.  
这是个谎言，但高藏可以坦然承认，世界正是靠这些善意的谎言运转的。

What disturbed him most was the response, dripping with venom.  
最让他不安的是那个充满恶意的回应。

"Sure, he did." “当然，他做到了。”

ʡʘʢ

Shinji stood there, breathing in the view of the purple humanoid in front of him.  
真嗣站在那里，呼吸着眼前紫色人形机甲的景象。

He was just standing there in his plug suit waiting for the crews to do their final checks before he'd be able to hop in.  
他只是穿着插入栓服站在那里，等待机组人员完成最后的检查，然后他就能跳进去了。

They forwent any testing, there wasn't time, it would be almost like his first battle again, only this time he actually had a good chance of dying.  
他们放弃了任何测试，没有时间了，这几乎就像他第一次战斗一样，只是这次他真的有可能死去。

Misato briefed them on her plan, the same old plan.  
美里向他们简述了她的计划，还是那个老计划。

Shinji had just stood there, listened, and nodded. There wasn't a whole lot he could do; he already knew what to expect.  
真嗣只是站在那里，听着，点头。他无能为力；他已经知道会发生什么。

He would miss the first shot, then he'd kill it with a second one.  
他会错过第一枪，然后用第二枪将其击毙。

He'd tried more than once to compensate for the rifle, but there wasn't a whole lot to be done, it wasn't the most predictable thing and after a few lives he'd just given up, let the MAGI do all that, he just pulled the trigger.  
他曾多次试图弥补那把步枪的不足，但能做的并不多，它并非最可预测的武器，经历了几次生命轮回后，他干脆放弃了，让 MAGI 处理这一切，他只需扣动扳机。

A hand clapped him on his shoulder startling him from his thoughts, looking back he saw the woman, a smile of confidence on her face.  
一只手拍在他的肩膀上，打断了他的思绪，回头一看，是那位女士，脸上带着自信的微笑。

He really couldn't be certain if she was putting up an act or she really believed in her plan. It was hard to tell with her and despite everything, Shinji had to begrudgingly admit she was an overly optimistic person.  
他真的无法确定她是在演戏还是真的相信自己的计划。她的心思难以捉摸，尽管如此，碇真嗣不得不勉强承认她是个过分乐观的人。

"Ready?" she asked him, that same confidence coursing through her voice.  
"准备好了吗？" 她问他，声音中流露出同样的自信。

"No, but I don't have a choice…" he mumbled.  
"没有，但我别无选择……" 他喃喃自语。

"Don't worry, all you have to do is pull the trigger, the MAGI will do the rest." She smiled, reassuringly.  
"别担心，你只需要扣动扳机，MAGI 会处理剩下的一切。" 她微笑着，安慰道。

Shinji shrugged "But what if I can't even pilot the thing?"  
真嗣耸了耸肩，"但如果我连驾驶它都做不到呢？"

Misato looked at him, "Shinji you've killed two Angels already, it'll be like riding a bike."  
美里看着他，"真嗣，你已经击败了两只使徒，这就像骑自行车一样简单。"

_Shinji looked back up at the plates of purple armor, resting against them that same figure he had seen in the morgue leaned against them.  
真嗣再次抬头望向那片紫色装甲板，靠在上面的是他在停尸房见过的那个身影。_

"_Same old Baka Shinji." She spat, glaring at him._  
“还是那个笨蛋真嗣。”她啐了一口，怒视着他。

"Like riding a bike." he echoed.  
“就像骑自行车一样。”他重复道。

She pulled something from her coat, it wasn't much more than a simple voice recorder. Handing out to him, Shinji just looked at the dark rectangle.  
她从外套里掏出一样东西，不过是个简单的录音机。递给他时，真嗣只是盯着那个黑色的长方形。

"It's a message left with the PR department at Headquarters." Misato said, handing the black rectangle to the pilot.  
“这是总部公关部留下的信息。”美里说着，将那个黑色长方形递给了驾驶员。

Shinji took the NERV-branded device from the older woman, clicking the play button, the long beep of a messaging machine played, much to his confusion.  
真嗣从那位年长的女性手中接过印有 NERV 标志的设备，按下播放键，传来的是留言机的长音，让他颇为困惑。

"Um, this is Toji, hey new kid, um I mean Shinji. We're counting on you man; you can do it."  
“呃，我是冬二，嘿，新来的小子，呃，我是说真嗣。我们全靠你了，伙计；你能行的。”

Shinji just looked dumbfounded at the device, Toji had sounded so… sincere. Had this happened in his first life? No, no he would have remembered, right?  
真嗣只是茫然地看着那个设备，冬二的声音听起来那么……真诚。这在他的前世发生过吗？不，不，他应该会记得的，对吧？

"Kensuke here, Shinji? Hang in there, ok?" the timid voice of the military geek rang from the tiny speakers inside the device.  
“我是剑介，真嗣？坚持住，好吗？”军事宅那怯生生的声音从设备里的小扬声器中传来。

The message ended, leaving the Third Children with a heavy weight in his chest.  
消息结束了，留给这位第三适格者胸中沉甸甸的负担。

What if they had sent that simple message the first time? What if he had heard those words when they really could have helped him?  
如果他们第一次就发送了这条简单的信息呢？如果他在真正需要帮助时听到了这些话呢？

He just handed the black rectangle back to Misato, doing his best to keep his hand steady.  
他只是将那个黑色矩形递还给美里，尽力保持手不颤抖。

Those words had been too little too late, for him at least. Had this been his first time around… well.  
那些话对他来说，来得太迟也太少。如果这是他第一次经历这一切……唉。

He was sure it would have made all the difference in the world.  
他确信这本可以改变一切。

### Chapter 4: "…As you watch me wander, curse the powers that be…"

The two pilots sat there, on top of pillars leading to their respective entry plugs. The moonlight gave them a beautiful view of the countryside, Shinji threw it up to his imagination, but the moon appeared to be much larger than usual tonight.  
两位驾驶员坐在各自插入栓的柱子顶端，月光为他们提供了乡村美景的绝佳视野，真嗣将其归功于自己的想象，但今晚的月亮似乎比平时大得多。

Perhaps it had to do with the fact that there was no light pollution. From the tip of Japan to its southernmost islands, the whole island chain's electrical grid was being funneled right to them.  
或许这与没有光污染有关。从日本最北端到最南端的岛屿，整个岛链的电网能量都被集中输送到了这里。

The only indication of life was the strings of lights for workers as they connected miles of wires to get all that power to them. No matter how many times he had this view, he always found it to be one of the most beautiful sights he had the privilege of seeing with his own eyes.  
唯一显示生命迹象的是工人们连接数英里电线时所用的灯光串。无论他看过多少次这番景象，他始终认为这是他亲眼所见中最美的景致之一。

Rei sat beside him at a reasonable distance, staring out into the same vastness. Neither of them had said a word, in all honesty he didn't know what to say, was there anything more for him to say?  
丽坐在他旁边，保持适当的距离，凝视着同样的浩瀚。两人都未发一言，说实话，他不知道该说什么，还有什么可说的呢？

"_Go ahead and blurt something out, I bet you could think of something stupid to say." She barked at him._  
“尽管说点什么吧，我敢打赌你能想出些蠢话来。”她冲他吼道。

Shinji looked over to Unit-01, leaning against its' purple armor plates stood his dread. Despite a bandage covering her left eye and her right arm being wrapped as well, the redhead that haunted him still looked beautiful to the Third Children.  
真嗣望向初号机，倚靠在其紫色装甲板上的，是他心中的恐惧。尽管左眼被绷带覆盖，右臂也缠着绷带，那位红发少女——他的梦魇，依然在他眼中显得美丽动人。

"_Salivating over me again Third? You're disgusting."_  
“又在对我垂涎三尺了吗，三号机驾驶员？你真令人作呕。”

_Disgusting… 令人作呕……_

_He was… 他……_

"Rei?" he asked, looking to free his mind of this.  
"丽？" 他问道，试图从这种思绪中解脱出来。

"Yes?" She asked in that same monotone voice he had come to know.  
"什么事？" 她用那他已熟悉的单调声音问道。

Shinji couldn't remember the last time when her voice was actually alive. When it was truly Rei Ayanami, the clone/hybrid, he could never tell if it was the drugs they gave her or just the natural order of things.  
真嗣记不清上一次她的声音真正充满活力是什么时候了。当那确实是绫波零，那个克隆/混血儿时，他永远无法分辨是药物的作用还是自然的常态。

If there was such a thing….  
如果有这样的事情……

"Why do you pilot the EVA?"  
“你为什么要驾驶 EVA？”

That was a stupid question, one he was sure he'd asked before.  
那是个愚蠢的问题，他确信自己以前问过。

"I might've asked that before, I guess you didn't hear…"  
"我可能之前问过，我想你没听到…"

"No, I was informed of your current condition" she interrupted him, looking over she eyed him up and down, like he was some curiosity. "I… do not know what I felt after I was informed you had died."  
"不，我得知了你目前的状况。" 她打断他，目光上下打量着他，仿佛他是什么稀奇之物。"我… 得知你去世的消息后，我不知道自己是什么感觉。"

That was a new one.  
这倒是新鲜事。

"Um…" "呃…"

"I believe the information was kept from me for some time, soon after I was told you were actually alive." she explained.  
“我相信这些信息被隐瞒了一段时间，不久前我才知道你其实还活着。”她解释道。

Shinji frowned "It's a bit much for them to keep that from you, don't you think?"  
“真嗣皱眉道：“他们对你隐瞒这些，你不觉得太过分了吗？”

"They did not want to distract me; I would have to take the shot if you had died."  
"他们不想让我分心；如果你死了，我必须得开枪。"

"I did die though…" "可我的确死了……"

He watched her closely, the moonlight did its best to show him what little emotion found its way onto her blank face.  
他紧盯着她，月光尽力向他展示她那张空白脸上流露出的些许情感。

"You can't remember any of our previous interactions?" she asked suddenly.  
"你对我们之前的互动一点印象都没有吗？" 她突然问道。

Rubbing the back of his head sheepishly he wasn't necessarily lying, after all he didn't remember _their_ interactions per say.  
他尴尬地挠了挠后脑勺，虽然不算是撒谎，毕竟他确实记不清他们之间的具体互动。

"Except right before I piloted Unit-01, there's not a whole lot there."  
"除了在驾驶初号机之前的那一刻，其他记忆确实不多。"

"Perhaps they will return in time." she suggested, making no notion that there had been anything to transpire between them that was out of the ordinary.  
“或许他们会及时回来。”她提议道，丝毫没有表现出他们之间曾发生过任何不寻常的事情。

Shinji kept his small smile to himself, they might, though something like that was rarely a guarantee.  
真嗣将那抹淡淡的微笑藏在心底，他们或许会，但这种事很少有保证。

Neither said anything for a few moments, each just looking back out to the countryside.  
两人沉默了片刻，各自只是望向乡间景色。

"Because it's a bond." she said softly, breaking the silence.  
"因为这是一种羁绊。" 她轻声说道，打破了沉默。

"What?" "什么？"

"You asked why I pilot the EVA. It's a bond," she said, her eyes refusing to leave the vastness in front of them "with everyone."  
"你问我为什么驾驶 EVA。这是一种羁绊，" 她说道，目光始终不愿离开眼前的浩瀚，"与每一个人。"

That was… new. 这真是……新鲜。

Standing up, her figure silhouetted against the moon and the countless stars in the sky, Shinji's mind wandered back to his original life, one where he had watched as an infinitely larger form had done the same.  
她站起身，身影在月亮和无数星辰的映衬下显得格外鲜明，这让真嗣的思绪飘回了原本的生活，那个他曾目睹一个更为庞大的身影做着同样动作的时刻。

"It's time," she said quietly, no panic or tension in her voice "goodbye."  
“是时候了，”她平静地说道，声音中没有一丝慌乱或紧张，“再见。”

_That's not ominous at all.  
这可一点也不不祥。_

"_Get in the EVA Shinji," the phantom growled, this time in his ear "it's all you're really good for anyways."_  
“进 EVA 吧，真嗣，”幻影在他耳边咆哮，“反正你也就这点用处了。”

ʡʘʢ

A bead of sweat ran down Misato's face as the enclosed bunker began to heat up. Between the computers and the people manning them, she figured they had about an hour till they all died of heat stroke in this poorly ventilated space.  
密室内的温度开始升高，一滴汗水从美里脸上滑落。她估算着，在电脑和操作人员之间，这个通风不良的掩体内，他们大约还有一个小时就会因中暑而全军覆没。

She watched as the two pilots entered their entry plugs, both beginning to be submerged in LCL.  
她看着两位驾驶员进入插入栓，开始被 LCL 液体淹没。

Syncing procedures were called out in the bunker, she only half listened, instead she stared intently at the boy on the screen in front of her.  
避难所内同步程序的指令此起彼伏，她只听了个大概，目光却紧紧锁定在面前屏幕上的那个男孩。

Shinji's eyes were closed, his head dipped, she couldn't help but look at that face and see for the first time the timid boy she had been caring for was at peace for some reason.  
真嗣双眼紧闭，头微微低垂，她不禁凝视着那张脸，第一次发现，那个她一直照顾着的胆怯男孩，不知为何竟显得如此安宁。

"Commander…" “司令……”

She turned to one of the terminal operators. Leaning over, Misato stared at their screen.  
她转向其中一位终端操作员。米莎托俯身过去，盯着他们的屏幕。

It was vital signs, Rei's seemed normal enough, elevated, but normal, even that monotone girl couldn't keep her body from producing adrenaline.  
这是生命体征，绫波的看起来还算正常，有所升高，但仍在正常范围内，即便是那个毫无感情的女孩也无法阻止身体产生肾上腺素。

Then there was Shinji… 然后是真嗣……

Her eyes narrowed, his heart rate was steady, not elevated in the slightest, like he was taking a nap.  
她的眼神变得锐利，他的心跳却平稳如常，丝毫未见加速，仿佛只是在打盹。

But more impressively the Sync Rate.  
但更令人印象深刻的是同步率。

"Make sure this data gets to Ritsuko." She told the operator, who nodded.  
“确保这份数据交给律子。”她对操作员说，对方点头应允。

Turning back to the screen with Shinji's resting face on it, she forced down the string of thoughts going through her mind.  
她转回屏幕，上面是真嗣平静的面容，她强压下心中涌动的一串思绪。

_74.3%_

That sync rate hadn't even been achieved by the Second Child, someone who trained the better part of their life to do this one job.  
就连第二适格者，那位一生中大部分时间都在为这项工作训练的人，也未曾达到过这样的同步率。

Part of her felt glad though, perhaps Shinji's whole resurrection experience had helped him in some way, made him more confident, though it had nothing to do with his abilities.  
尽管如此，她的一部分感到欣慰，或许真嗣的整个复活经历以某种方式帮助了他，使他更加自信，尽管这与他的能力无关。

Part of her wanted to call him back, she had to live for hours with the thought… no, _knowledge_ that she had sent that child to his death. Part of her wanted him out of the Eva forever and stuck in some bunker for the rest of his life, just to keep him safe.  
她内心的一部分想要叫他回来，她不得不忍受数小时的想法……不，是确信她将那个孩子送上了死路。另一部分则希望他永远离开 EVA，被安置在某个掩体中度过余生，只为确保他的安全。

"Shinji." she started, as she pressed a button for the comm link to his EVA.  
“真嗣。”她开口道，同时按下了与他 EVA 通讯的按钮。

The boy man no indication that he heard her voice; it was like she wasn't even there.  
那个男孩，或者说男人，没有表现出任何听到她声音的迹象；仿佛她根本不存在一样。

What was she supposed to say? 'I got you killed last time, but don't worry that won't happen again?', no, there were no good words for her to say now.  
她该说什么呢？‘上次是我害死了你，但别担心，这不会再发生了’，不，现在她找不到任何合适的词句。

"Look, whatever happens out there… I'm grateful to you, just for trying,"  
“听着，无论外面发生什么……我感激你，仅仅因为你尝试过，”

"Thank you." she spoke softly, hoping he understood how she felt.  
“谢谢你。”她轻声说道，希望他能理解她的感受。

At that he opened his eyes and had she not been turned away the Lieutenant Colonel would have noticed how different he looked; how old those eyes were.  
听到这话，他睁开了眼睛，如果不是她转过身去，中校本该注意到他的眼神有多么不同；那双眼睛显得多么苍老。

ʡʘʢ

Shinji blocked out all other noise.  
真嗣屏蔽了所有其他噪音。

Right now, all he needed to hear was the deep rhythmic thump of his own heartbeat.  
此刻，他只需要听到自己深沉而有节奏的心跳声。

Laying there, he looked at the Angel floating over the city he had come to know, the positron cannon he'd fired countless times, shouldered and waiting for power.  
躺在那里，他凝视着悬浮在他所熟悉的城市上空的天使，那把他无数次发射过的阳电子炮，正肩负着，等待着充能。

The night sky lit up with the streaks of hundreds of missiles being launched at the Angel. He was laser focused, perhaps he'd even hit it with one shot for once.  
夜空被数百枚导弹的轨迹点亮。他全神贯注，或许这次他甚至能一击命中。

"_Dummkopf! You've had thousands of tries, like you'd make it this time!"_  
“笨蛋！你试了成千上万次，这次就能成功吗！”

Typically, he didn't have to worry about her inside the entry plug, for some reason it was a rarity that she'd even be here, but here she was, right behind him, yelling into his ear, it was almost as if they were back in the middle of the Pacific. Crammed together in Unit-02 after meeting for the first time.  
通常情况下，他不必担心她在插入栓内，不知为何她甚至出现在这里都极为罕见，但她就在这儿，紧随其后，对着他的耳朵大喊，仿佛他们又回到了太平洋中部。初次相遇后挤在二号机里。

Those were simpler times.  
那些日子更为单纯。

Shinji did his best to block her out, but the real distraction came from the Sixth Angel itself.  
真嗣尽力屏蔽她的声音，但真正的干扰来自第六使徒本身。

"Their _Sixth Baka, it's still Ramiel to you!"_  
“他们的第六个笨蛋，对你来说还是拉米尔！”

Ignoring the comment, the Third Children watched as it morphed, or more accurately seemed to shatter and scream, a horrible sound that seemed to cut into his ears.  
无视了这番话，第三适格者看着它变形，或者更准确地说，似乎是破碎并尖叫起来，一种可怕的声音，仿佛刺入了他的耳朵。

He'd never seen something like this, in all his time he'd only ever seen the Angel as the floating solid diamond.  
在他所有的经历中，他从未见过这样的景象，一直以来，他只见过使徒是那个悬浮的实心钻石。

Though its basic offensive and defensive attributes remained the same, it was always a tricky situation, he'd always wished NERV had purpose built an insanely powerful rifle for the EVAs, but perhaps they never truly anticipated this. Despite the fact there were people whose jobs were specifically to think up these strange situations.  
尽管其基本的攻防属性保持不变，这始终是一个棘手的情况，他一直希望 NERV 能为 EVA 专门制造一把极其强大的步枪，但或许他们从未真正预料到这一点。尽管有人的工作就是专门设想这些奇怪的情况。

The targeting display that had folded down over the top half of his face flashed its special symbols and targeting information, if he really wanted to, he could understand it, but he didn't want to, if anything, he was annoyed with the flashing colors.  
覆盖在他上半脸部的瞄准显示器闪烁着特殊符号和瞄准信息，如果他真的想，他可以理解，但他不想，如果有什么，他反而对这些闪烁的颜色感到厌烦。

He could have sworn the system had never been this bulky, but it didn't matter, he was only there to pull a trigger. Hopefully once, but it never seemed to be that easy.  
他敢发誓系统从未如此笨重，但这并不重要，他只是去扣动扳机。希望一次就够，但事情似乎从来都不那么简单。

He heard callouts for the command bunker, power was being transferred to the rifle, hundreds of miles of cable electrified, thousands of workers eyed their own gauges so that nothing would fail.  
他听到指挥掩体内的呼叫声，能量正传输到步枪上，数百英里的电缆通电，成千上万的工人紧盯着自己的仪表，确保一切无误。

Then the countdown began.  
随后，倒计时开始了。

"Thirteen." “十三。”

Shinji breathed in a nose full of LCL, he always expected his body to react like his very first time, but it never did.  
真嗣深吸了一口 LCL，他总以为自己的身体会像第一次那样反应，但从未有过。

"Twelve" “十二”

Maybe that's just what happens after you do something too many times, you become desensitized.  
或许这就是重复做某件事太多后的结果，你会变得麻木。

"Eleven" "十一"

How many times had he sat with this rifle in his hands?  
他曾多少次这样手持着这把步枪坐着？

"Ten" "十"

How many times had he missed this first shot?  
他错过了多少次这第一枪？

"Nine." “九次。”

How many times had Rei been killed in front of him because he wasn't fast enough?  
因为不够快，丽在他面前死了多少次？

"Eight." "八。"

"_Yeah, how many times have you screwed everything up?!"_  
"是啊，你搞砸了多少次了？！"

"Seven." "七。"

"_How many times have you let everyone die?!"_  
"你已经让所有人死了多少次了？！"

"Six_."_ "六次。"

"_How many times have you let_ me _die?!"_  
"你让我死了多少次了？！"

"Five" “五”

Perhaps he could never change.  
或许他永远无法改变。

"Four." “四”

Another life, another world on his shoulders.  
另一段人生，另一重世界压在他肩上。

"Three." “三。”

The fate of the world on his shoulders was just another Tuesday for him at this point.  
世界的命运压在肩上，对他来说不过是又一个平凡的周二。

"Two" “二”

"_You're just able to hide it now, but you're just as scared as the first day you stepped in an EVA!"_  
"你现在只是学会了隐藏，但你踏进 EVA 的第一天一样害怕！"

"One!" "一！"

Maybe he was. 或许他是吧。

"NOW FIRE!" he heard Misato shouted through the com system.  
"现在开火！" 他听到美里通过通讯系统喊道。

Maybe he wasn't. 或许他并没有。

Reminding himself not to jerk the trigger as the reticle aligned with the center mass of the Angel, Shinji squeezed the trigger on the rifle with smoothness that could only come from taking the same shoot countless times.  
提醒自己不要急躁扣动扳机，当瞄准镜对准使徒的中心躯体时，真嗣平稳地扣动了步枪的扳机，这种流畅只能来自于无数次相同的射击练习。

A flash of blue from behind him, tenths of a second long, all strings of energy converging into the rifle. Another flash, this one from the barrel, sending the whole power of Japan condensed into a single beam of energy towards the target.  
他身后闪过一道蓝光，仅持续了十分之一秒，所有能量汇聚于步枪。又一闪光，这次来自枪管，将日本全部力量凝缩成一道能量束射向目标。

Surprisingly to the Third Children, there was nothing in return for him, no opposing beam warping his own.  
令第三适格者意外的是，对方并未回应，没有扭曲他射出的光束。

Instead, his eyes told him that it had punched through the core of Ramiel, and then it screamed.  
相反，他的眼睛告诉他，那束能量已贯穿了雷米尔的核心，随后它发出了尖叫。

Later they would only be able to describe it as a scream, but the sound had more in kind with a poorly played violin then a human, it still cut at his ears despite the protective shell of the EVA.  
后来他们只能将其描述为一声尖叫，但这声音更像是拙劣演奏的小提琴而非人类，即便有 EVA 的保护层，它依旧刺痛着他的耳朵。

Through the rifle's scope he could see a wash of red flood over buildings in Tokyo-3, but it wasn't dead.  
透过步枪的瞄准镜，他能看到东京-3 的建筑物被一片红色淹没，但这并非死亡的征兆。

"We missed it?!" he heard over the coms.  
“我们错过了？！”他在通讯器中听到这样的声音。

"But how our timing was perfect?"  
“但我们的时机是如何完美呢？”

"It's charging, energy readings rising!"  
"正在充电，能量读数上升！"

"Everyone Brace for direct impact!"  
“所有人抓紧，直接撞击要来了！”

Readying his AT field, Shinji prepared for the inevitable.  
准备好 AT 力场，真嗣准备迎接不可避免的冲击。

Taking a breath of LCL, he ignored the bloody taste.  
吸入一口 LCL，他无视了那股血腥味。

He wasn't going to let anyone die today.  
他今天绝不会让任何人死去。

### Chapter 5: "…you've got a way to fall…"

If you could be completely calm as your death barreled towards you, Shinji Ikari would probably be the only proof that it was possible.  
如果你能在死亡迎面而来时完全保持冷静，碇真嗣大概是唯一能证明这是可能的证据。

The ageless boy readied his AT field, angling it at the most obtuse angle to deflect what little of the beam he could way from the positron rifle.  
那永葆青春的少年准备好了他的 AT 力场，将其调整到最钝的角度，以偏转正电子步枪射出的微弱光束。

He watched as the Angel's shape warped and folded, creating massive dynamic shapes as it screamed and charged its attack. Time seemed to slow as the pure energy shot towards his position and he was forced to close his eyes as his targeting screen was blinded by light.  
他目睹着天使的形态扭曲折叠，创造出巨大的动态形状，随着它尖叫并蓄力攻击。时间似乎放缓了，纯粹的能量朝他的位置射来，他被迫闭上眼睛，因为他的瞄准屏幕被强光所遮蔽。

Around him, his world exploded as the beam of pure energy engulfed him and the surrounding mountainside. Nothing was spared by the attack, the concrete platform he was currently prone on was eroded by the beam, disintegrated by the intense heat and pressure.  
在他周围，世界爆炸了，纯能量光束吞噬了他和周围的山坡。没有任何东西能逃过这一击，他目前趴着的混凝土平台被光束侵蚀，在强烈的热量和压力下分解。

Through his closed eyes Shinji focused on the strength of his field, in spite of the increasingly alien feeling he was beginning to have inside the EVA, but he didn't have time to dwell on it.  
闭着眼睛的真嗣专注于他的力场强度，尽管他开始在 EVA 中感受到越来越异样的感觉，但他没有时间深究。

If he lost an arm, he could still shoot, if the rifle was damaged then all hope was lost.  
即便失去一条手臂，他仍能射击；但如果步枪损坏，那一切希望都将破灭。

ʡʘʢ

Despite the intense jolt they had felt in the bunker, despite the heat that now had her body coated in sweat, despite the fact that they might have missed their one and only shot at killing the Angel, Misato found the only thought that entered her mind as she picked herself off the ground was if Shinji was ok.  
尽管地堡中感受到的强烈冲击，尽管此刻全身被汗水浸透的热浪，尽管他们可能已经错失了唯一一次击杀使徒的机会，但当美里从地上爬起时，她脑海中唯一浮现的念头是真嗣是否安好。

"Pilot status?" she barked at her subordinates.  
“驾驶员状况如何？”她厉声询问下属。

"Vitals stable," one croaked out "heart rate only slightly elevated" other one called out incredibly.  
“生命体征稳定，”一个嘶哑地说道，“心率仅轻微升高。”另一个极其专业地喊道。

Breathing a sigh of relief, she composed herself. She would not make the same mistake; she would not falter here.  
她松了一口气，镇定下来。她不会再犯同样的错误；她不会在这里动摇。

For Shinji's sake. 为了真嗣。

"How's the power system?" she asked.  
"能源系统怎么样？" 她问道。

"Still online, looks like it's already starting to recharge."  
"还在线，看起来已经开始重新充电了。"

"and the positron cannon?"  
"那正电子炮呢？"

"Minimal damage, it appears to be mostly superficial."  
"看来损伤不大，主要是些皮外伤。"

"Shinji!?" Misato called out, praying for an answer.  
"真嗣！？" 美里呼喊着，祈祷着回应。

ʡʘʢ

The hellscape he opened his eyes to really was impressive, he would have to think back to horrible worlds just to find a reference close to its state.  
他睁眼所见的这片地狱景象确实令人震撼，他得回想那些糟糕透顶的世界，才能找到一个与之状态相近的参照。

"Shinji?" Misato called out to him.  
"真嗣？" 美里呼唤着他。

Groaning he tried his limbs, the lack of real pain told him that they were still intact.  
他呻吟着尝试活动四肢，没有真正的疼痛感告诉他它们还完好无损。

"Get back into firing position now!" he heard through the comms. His body groaned in protest as he willed himself forward, his hands burning from the superheated ground as he pushed his EVA up.  
"立即回到射击位置！" 他通过通讯设备听到命令。他的身体发出抗议的呻吟，但他强迫自己向前移动，双手因地面过热而灼痛，他推动着 EVA 起身。

Left with only the tendrils of smoky haze around him, he lifted the positron rifle, had it been this heavy before?  
四周只剩下缭绕的烟雾，他举起阳电子步枪，这东西以前有这么重吗？

"Shinji, one more time, with all the power of Japan behind you, all of our hopes, our futures, our lives, along with the lives of every creature on this planet, it's all in your hands now."  
“真嗣，再一次，带着整个日本的力量，我们所有的希望，未来，生命，以及这颗星球上所有生物的命运，现在都掌握在你手中了。”

_A dark laugh echoed in his ear.  
一阵阴沉的笑声在他耳边回荡。_

"_Oh, the irony, if only they knew Baka."_  
"哦，讽刺啊，要是他们知道笨蛋就好了。"

He stopped, resting the rifle, frozen by those words. The specter was right, if only this Misato knew who she was really talking to.  
他停了下来，将步枪搁置一旁，被那些话冻结了动作。幽灵说得没错，如果这个美里知道她真正在和谁说话就好了。

His sin was so great he could barely stand the knowledge of its existence, let alone his punishment.  
他的罪孽如此深重，以至于他几乎无法承受其存在的事实，更不用说他的惩罚了。

"Do your best." "尽你所能。"

He blinked three simple words from Misato, yet…  
他眨眼间，从美里那里听到了这三个简单的词，然而……

He could, he would. 他能做到，他会的。

Raising the rifle, he tossed off the Type-6 equipment, its' sensors had melted to the point of uselessness, he'd be on manual control now.  
他举起步枪，甩掉了已经熔化到无用的 Type-6 装备，现在他将完全手动控制。

Just beyond the haze, he could see the Angel, its core clipped and spilling out energy and LCL in sporadic arcs. It screamed in anger; its fury on fully display by its constant dynamic shaping.  
在雾霾之外，他能看到那个使徒，其核心被击中，能量和 LCL 以不规则的弧线喷涌而出。它愤怒地尖叫着，通过不断变化的形态完全展现了它的狂怒。

"Hurry up with the second round!" Misato called to him.  
“快点发射第二轮！”美里向他喊道。

"_BAKA, I could do this faster than you!"_  
"笨蛋，我比你快多了！"

He knew that. She was always better than him.  
他知道这一点。她总是比他强。

He racked the bolt, throwing the spent fuse to the ground.  
他拉开枪栓，将用过的弹壳扔到地上。

Ignoring the callouts from techs and engineers, he listened to his heart rate, it wasn't exactly pounding in his ears, but that didn't matter, he knew what he felt.  
无视技术人员和工程师的呼喊，他倾听着自己的心跳，虽然并未如雷贯耳，但这并不重要，他清楚自己的感受。

Fear… 恐惧……

Fear of missing… 害怕错过……

Fear of failure… 对失败的恐惧……

Lining up his scope the Third Children watched at the leaking core began to glow again, signaling the inevitable.  
第三适格者透过瞄准镜，注视着泄漏的核心再次发光，预示着不可避免的事态。

"Target's energy levels are on the rise!"  
“目标能量水平正在上升！”

He said noting as a beam of pure energy shot at him for a second time, he didn't even avert his eyes either.  
一道纯粹的能量光束再次向他射来，他一言不发，甚至连眼睛都没有眨一下。

He trusted her. 他信任她。

And just like she had done for him an untold number of times before this, she was there, his shield against the beam of light, a comrade in arms, someone he could call friend, Rei Ayanami.  
就像她无数次为他所做的那样，这一次她依然在那里，是他抵御光束的盾牌，是并肩作战的战友，是他可以称之为朋友的人——绫波零。

"Twenty more seconds!" a callout roared.  
“再过二十秒！”一声呼喊响彻云霄。

That shield wouldn't last that long.  
那护盾撑不了那么久。

Shinji watched as the repurposed spacecraft's ablative covering disintegrated again the onslaught, its outer edges eroding against the massive stream of energy barreling towards them. He did his best to concentrate on the Angel, despite the threat to his friend.  
真嗣注视着那艘改装飞船的烧蚀层在猛攻下再次分解，其外缘在汹涌而来的巨大能量流冲击下逐渐消蚀。尽管朋友面临威胁，他仍尽力集中精神于使徒身上。

"_She's replaceable IDIOT!"_  
"她是可以被替代的，白痴！"

She wasn't, not to him.  
但她对他来说，是无可替代的。

He could see her EVA now taking the brunt of the force, Shinji could witness the armor welding itself inwards.  
他现在可以看到她的 EVA 承受着巨大的冲击力，真嗣目睹着装甲正向内焊接。

He didn't need to imagine what it felt like.  
他无需想象那是什么感觉。

Finally, the reticle flashed clearing him to fire.  
终于，瞄准镜闪烁了一下，准许他开火。

He didn't hesitate, not this time.  
这次他没有犹豫。

With skill that one can only learn from piloting over countless lives Shinji smoothly squeezed the index finger of his EVA. Behind him, arcs of blue energy funneled into the rifle, instantly shooting a condensed teal beam against the Sixth Angel's Purple beam.  
凭借在无数次生命中驾驶 EVA 所磨练出的技艺，真嗣熟练地用 EVA 的食指轻轻一按。在他身后，蓝色的能量弧线汇聚到步枪中，瞬间向第六使徒的紫色光束射出一道浓缩的青色光束。

For a moment nothing happened before he could see a massive fireball explode out the back of the Angel.  
有那么一刻，什么都没有发生，直到他看到使徒背后爆发出一团巨大的火球。

Then it screamed. 随后，它发出了尖叫。

No one else would feel the same way, no one else would hear what he heard, a chorus of screams that he had been lucky enough to experience in his lives seemingly came back all at once in his mind's eye.  
没有人会有同样的感受，没有人会听到他所听到的，仿佛他一生中幸运经历过的那些尖叫合唱，突然间全部在他的脑海中重现。

It was just one more memory for him to relive in his nightmares.  
这只是又一个让他夜不能寐的记忆。

What's one more? 再多一个又何妨？

As the Angel poured its red fluids around the cityscape, Shinji had already thrown down the rifle.  
当使徒在城市中倾泻其红色液体时，真嗣已经丢下了步枪。

Looking for Unit-00 in the burning landscape, he finally found the melted yellow pile of metal, picking it up, Unit-01 rushed down the smoldering mountainside to the nearby lake, tossing the superheated EVA into the shallows with a cloud of steam being thrown back in his face.  
在燃烧的景象中寻找零号机，他终于发现了那堆熔化的黄色金属，拾起它，初号机冲下冒烟的山坡，奔向附近的湖泊，将滚烫的 EVA 抛入浅水区，蒸汽如云般扑面而来。

Extracting his progressive knife, Shinji expertly pried the entry plug out with precision that only came with doing it hundreds of times before.  
拔出高振动粒子刀，真嗣熟练地精准撬出插入栓，这种熟练度只有经过数百次的操作才能达到。

The boy clenched his teeth as he put the still-hot entry plug into the water, in an attempt to cool it off just that bit more, before placing it on the beach and exiting out of Unit-01.  
男孩咬紧牙关，将尚有余温的插入栓浸入水中，试图再冷却一些，然后将其放置在海滩上，从初号机中走出。

Rushing to the pod, he paid no mind to the sand that burned his feet through the plug suit.  
他急忙冲向驾驶舱，毫不在意沙子透过插入栓服灼烧着他的双脚。

No, he knew that he would be in for plenty of pain by opening the pod with the emergency latch handles. As he struggled, Shinji cursed this weak 14-year-old body, not that it was doing him any good, but eventually, the steam that blasted him in the face was the reward for his effort.  
不，他知道用紧急拉手打开驾驶舱会带来不少痛苦。在挣扎中，真嗣咒骂着这副 14 岁虚弱的身体，尽管这并无益处，但最终，迎面而来的蒸汽是他努力的回报。

With a pneumatic hiss the latch came open, and rushing inside he saw her, sprawled out in the pilot seat, seemingly limp.  
随着一声气动嘶响，锁扣弹开了，他冲进舱内，只见她瘫倒在驾驶员座椅上，似乎毫无生气。

His heart dropped as he slowly made his way into the plug, the soft splash of his feet in the last remaining bit of LCL the only noise being made.  
他的心沉了下去，缓缓走进插入栓，脚下最后一丝 LCL 的轻柔溅声成了唯一的声响。

"Rei?" he asked quietly, not truly expecting a response.  
“丽？”他轻声问道，并未真正期待回应。

"_Add one to your count" he heard from her leaning against the outside of the entry plug._  
“计数加一”，他从插入栓外听到她靠在那儿说道。

Taking another step, he felt his heart jump as Rei groaned and lazily raised her head enough to make eye contact with him.  
他又迈出一步，感觉到心跳加速，因为零呻吟着，慵懒地抬起头，足以与他目光相接。

Letting out a breath of air he didn't realize he was holding the Third Children felt as if his body had tripled in weight. It was probably just the adrenaline wearing off, but at the same time, he knew it was the relief that Rei hadn't been killed on his watch.  
他呼出一口气，才发现自己一直屏着呼吸，第三适格者感觉身体仿佛重了三倍。这大概只是肾上腺素消退的缘故，但同时，他也明白这是因为零在他的看护下没有丧命而感到的宽慰。

Again. 再一次。

"You have nothing, really? You were going to leave me on that?"  
"你真的什么都没有吗？你就打算这样把我留在那儿？"

The bluenette just blinked at him, still dumbfounded as the boy shifted more weight against the inside wall of the entry plug. Letting himself slide down and into the shallow layer of LCL Shinji couldn't help but allow a small smile to appear on his face.  
蓝发少年只是对他眨了眨眼，依旧一脸茫然，男孩在插入栓内侧墙上挪动身体，让自己滑落进浅浅的 LCL 中。真嗣忍不住露出了一个微笑。

"That whole dramatic goodbye thing?" he mumbled, unable to keep a tired voice from escaping his lips.  
"那场戏剧性的告别？" 他咕哝着，无法抑制疲惫的声音从唇间溜出。

Resting his arms on his bent knees he just shook his head "Don't do that again, got it?"  
他将双臂搭在弯曲的膝盖上，只是摇了摇头，"别再那样做了，明白吗？"

He rested his head back against the still warm side of the entry plug, closing his eyes he couldn't find the strength to break the silence that had fallen between them.  
他将头靠在依然温热的驾驶舱侧壁上，闭上眼睛，却找不到打破他们之间沉默的力气。

She on the other hand…  
而她那边……

"Why were you so concerned?" the First Children asked in her trademark monotone voice.  
“你为何如此关心？”第一使徒用她标志性的单调声音问道。

Without opening his eyes Shinji couldn't help but give a barely audible chuckle. Shaking his head, he looked back at the girl, a small smirk appearing at the edge of his lips.  
真嗣没有睁开眼睛，忍不住发出了一声几乎听不见的轻笑。他摇了摇头，再次看向女孩，嘴角浮现出一丝淡淡的笑意。

Groaning as he stood up, the boy just offered the First Children his burnt hand.  
他站起来时呻吟着，男孩只是向初代子民伸出了他烧伤的手。

"C'mon, let's get you out of here."  
“来吧，我们带你离开这里。”

ʡʘʢ

Leaning against the tiled shower wall, the boy was doing everything to keep himself upright as he washed the dried and crusty LCL from his hair.  
男孩倚靠在瓷砖淋浴墙上，竭尽全力保持直立，清洗着头发上干涸结痂的 LCL。

God, he was tired. 天啊，他累坏了。

"_Tired after one little mission, hmph, no wonder you're stuck like this."_  
“才一个小任务就累成这样，哼，难怪你一直停滞不前。”

She was leaning against the far wall, the water not affecting her. It wasn't like she was actually there after all.  
她靠在远处的墙上，水对她毫无影响。毕竟，她实际上并不在那里。

Of course, she wasn't, but that didn't make her any less real to him.  
当然，她并非真实存在，但这并不减少她在他心中的真实感。

Nor the things he did to her.  
他对她所做的一切也是如此。

"_Gonna cry in the shower Baka? Gott you're pathetic."_  
“要在浴室里哭鼻子吗，笨蛋？真是没出息。”

Trying his best to drown out her voice with the rushing of water, he worked the last bits of crusty LCL out of his hair. Through all the commotion he only just now realized that instead of the orange color he had come to know, instead here it was red. A small, perhaps trivial change, but with enough small changes…  
他尽力用哗哗的水声掩盖她的声音，努力洗掉头发上最后一点干硬的 LCL。在这一切混乱中，他刚刚才意识到，这里的水不再是熟悉的橙色，而是红色。虽然只是一个小小的、或许微不足道的变化，但足够多的微小变化……

Well, they tended to add up to something big.  
通常会累积成重大的变化。

He knew because this was his life now, or perhaps existence was a better word for it. One life or world to the next, with only her as his companion.  
他知道这一点，因为这就是他现在的生活，或者更确切地说，是他的存在方式。从一个生命或世界到另一个，只有她作为他的伴侣。

Tormentor was more accurate.  
“折磨者”更为贴切。

Shinji rubbed his eyes and finished; he didn't need to be thinking about this now, he was too exhausted. Dragging himself from the locker room he threw on the school clothes they had given back to him right before sending him off to get into his plug suit.  
真嗣揉了揉眼睛，结束了思考；他现在太累了，不想再想这些。他拖着疲惫的身体从更衣室出来，迅速穿上学校归还给他的校服，准备换上插入栓服。

Reaching into the bundle of clothes, he felt a sense of relief at the familiar shape of Misato's pendant.  
在衣物堆中摸索时，他摸到了美里小姐的吊坠，熟悉的形状让他感到一丝安慰。

_His_ Misato's pendant. 他的美里吊坠。

This place was strange, it was so similar to his first life, but… off. It'd been so long since he'd been dumped somewhere that closely resembled his original life this much and typically it wasn't so late either.  
这个地方很诡异，与他的第一世如此相似，但又……有些不对劲。他已经很久没有被扔到一个与原生生活如此接近的地方了，而且通常也不会这么晚。

Usually, he expected to show up around the time Misato had delivered him to NERV, more than once his existence had been cut short by an N2 blast that was just a little too close to Misato's car. Other times he could show up as late as when Shamshel appearing in Tokyo 3.  
通常，他预计会在美里将他送到 NERV 的时候出现，不止一次，他的存在因距离美里车太近的 N2 爆炸而提前结束。其他时候，他甚至可能晚到沙姆谢尔出现在第三新东京市的时候才出现。

An even rarer occurrence was when he would be able to live before all this, before the EVAs and Angels, as just a no-name kid. Weirder lives had him with no knowledge of his others, only after he died did those memories seem to get added to the collection of other memories.  
更罕见的情况是，他能在这一切之前，在 EVA 和使徒出现之前，作为一个无名小孩生活。更奇怪的生活让他对自己的其他身份一无所知，只有在死后，那些记忆似乎才被添加到其他记忆的集合中。

Then there were… 然后还有……

"_All you do is mope around, get your sorry ass moving!" she shouted in his ear._  
“你整天就只会闷闷不乐，快点振作起来！”她在他的耳边吼道。

Shinji pinched the bridge of his nose, as usual, she was right, he'd think about this later, even after all this time his predicament still made his head spin.  
真嗣捏了捏鼻梁，一如既往，她说的没错，他打算稍后再考虑这些，即便过了这么久，他的困境依然让他头晕目眩。

Right now, he needed a nice… well it wouldn't be a bed, but he'd learned how to sleep on just about any surface or as well as you could when your dreams had become an amalgamation of your failures.  
现在，他需要一个舒适的地方……当然，那不会是一张床，但他已经学会了在任何表面上入睡，或者在你梦见自己失败的混合体时，尽可能地睡得好。

Dragging himself to his feet he made sure to collect his things and walked towards the door. His feet were dragging he was so exhausted that as soon as he opened the door leading out of the locker room the boy ran into a waiting violet-haired director, who reacted fast enough to catch the boy from falling.  
他艰难地站起身，确保收拾好自己的物品，然后走向门口。他的脚步沉重，疲惫至极，以至于刚打开通往更衣室外的门，就撞上了等候着的紫发导演，对方反应迅速，及时扶住了差点摔倒的少年。

"Alright there Shinji?" She asked, a tired, yet warm smile on her face.  
“没事吧，真嗣？”她问道，脸上带着疲惫却温暖的微笑。

The Third Children just nodded, fighting to keep his eyes open.  
第三适格者只是点了点头，努力不让自己的眼睛闭上。

That smile seemed to grow slightly on Misato's face as she wrapped an arm around the dark-haired teen.  
那微笑似乎在美里脸上微微扩大，她用一只手臂环住了黑发少年的肩膀。

They moved as one, with Shinji leaning on her more and more as they walked.  
他们如一体般移动，真嗣越来越依赖她，随着步伐越发倚靠。

Neither said anything, neither had to.  
两人都没有说话，也无需言语。

ʡʘʢ

Misato's smile stayed on her face as they walked through the winding halls of NERV HQ.  
美里脸上挂着微笑，与他们一同穿行在 NERV 总部蜿蜒的走廊中。

The young man who was practically using her to stand up couldn't have noticed, not with his half-closed eyes and empty stare.  
那个几乎靠在她身上才能站稳的年轻人，恐怕并未察觉，毕竟他双眼半闭，目光空洞。

They half walked, half stumbled their way through the base, ready to take a lift to the surface. She was lucky that they only passed a few personnel burning the midnight oil, she didn't know if this was best look for either of them.  
他们半走半跌地穿过基地，准备搭乘电梯上到地面。她庆幸他们只遇到了几个深夜加班的人员，她不确定这对他们俩来说是不是最好的形象。

It was like a haze, everything that had transpired. Her mind was foggy, one minute they were on the lift, the next she fumbling with her keys to get into her car.  
一切都像笼罩在迷雾中，发生了什么她都记不清了。她的思绪一片混乱，前一刻他们还在电梯里，下一刻她就在摸索着钥匙打开车门。

She steadied herself, luckily the roar of the engine was enough to snap her to her senses enough to drive. Shinji on the other hand, just collapsed into his seat seemingly passed out.  
她稳住自己，幸好引擎的轰鸣声足以让她恢复些许理智来驾驶。而真嗣那边，则似乎是直接瘫倒在座位上，像是昏了过去。

Before she could bring herself to shift the car into gear, she just looked at the boy who had done so much for them while asking so little in return, thrust into this new life with no expectation.  
在她能让自己换挡之前，她只是看着那个男孩，他为她们做了那么多，却几乎不求回报，就这样被推入这个全新的生活，没有任何期待。

Pity. 怜悯。

And Guilt. 还有愧疚。

Those were the two things burning a hole in her chest, pity for what NERV had the boy go through, and guilt because, after all, she was the one who brought the boy here and it seemed like she was constantly talking him into staying. At least the Second Child had trained for this for the majority of her life and seemed to actually enjoy it. Like that, that was any fairer to her either though.  
这两件事在她胸中灼烧，一是对 NERV 让那男孩经历的一切感到同情，二是内疚，毕竟，是她把男孩带到这里，而且似乎总是劝他留下。至少二号适格者一生大部分时间都在为此训练，并且似乎真的乐在其中。尽管如此，这对她来说也并不公平。

Misato almost laughed at the thought of the two of them meeting. Polar opposite personalities… she figured in a month or so the redhead would arrive from Germany, and then that would be quite the sight.  
想到他们俩见面的情景，Misato 几乎笑出声来。截然相反的性格……她猜想大约一个月后，那位红发女孩会从德国来到这里，到那时场面一定相当有趣。

The gears in her head turned as her imagination ran wild with the two of them meeting for the first time, the thought of the Second Child's fiery personality clashing with Shinji's was the only thing that seemed to keep her eyes open as they blazed through the streets.  
她脑海中的齿轮转动着，想象着他们初次相遇的情景，二号机驾驶员那火爆的个性与真嗣的碰撞，似乎成了唯一让她目光炯炯、穿梭于街道之间的动力。

The drive was short, even without her crazy driving, instead, the roads were simply barren, with no traffic to speak of. Parking her beloved A310, she let out a sigh and rubbed her eyes, what they needed both was sleep, and perhaps a beer.  
车程很短，即便没有她疯狂的驾驶，道路也异常空旷，几乎不见车辆。她停好心爱的 A310，叹了口气，揉揉眼睛，他们现在最需要的是睡眠，或许还有一杯啤酒。

After shaking Shinji, the two fading roommates dragged themselves from the car, like zombies they both stumbled their way up the dimly lit apartment complex.  
在摇醒真嗣后，两位逐渐虚弱的室友像僵尸般从车里拖着身子出来，踉踉跄跄地走向昏暗的公寓楼。

As Shinji watched the woman take 4 tries to swipe her card correctly, the boy felt he was lucky to be alive considering she probably would have crashed into another car had there been one on the road tonight.  
当真嗣看着那位女士尝试了四次才正确刷卡时，他觉得自己能活着真是幸运，因为如果今晚路上有其他车的话，她很可能会撞上另一辆车。

Walking into the apartment he was greeted by the same smells and sights that he was accustomed to, a wave of nostalgia blasted over him, but he didn't loiter, neither of them did. Mumbling pleasantries, they both went straight for their respective rooms and respective beds.  
走进公寓，他迎面而来的是熟悉的气味和景象，一股怀旧之情涌上心头，但他没有逗留，他们俩都没有。他们咕哝着寒暄，径直走向各自的房间和各自的床。

Shinji eyed the room he had lazily, looking for some difference, but there was nothing that stuck out at him, at least not that he could remember with his sleep-deprived brain.  
真嗣懒洋洋地打量着房间，试图找出些许不同，但眼前的一切并未引起他的注意，至少在他那因缺乏睡眠而迟钝的脑海中，没有什么特别之处。

_Nothing other than the redheaded specter standing ominously in the corner.  
除了角落里那个不祥的红发幽灵，别无他物。_

Eyeing the SDAT player that rested on the nightstand he shook his head. Picking it up he unwrapped the spool of earbud and just stared at it.  
他盯着床头柜上的 SDAT 播放器，摇了摇头。拿起它，解开耳机线的缠绕，只是凝视着它。

He thought about pressing play, about humoring himself, and seeing if the songs were the same as his original life.  
他考虑过按下播放键，想逗自己开心，看看这些歌曲是否与他原来的生活相同。

If he even remembered those correctly.  
如果他连这些都记得没错的话。

Instead, he put his old friend back down and brushed his fingers across its familiar surface.  
相反，他将自己的老朋友放回原处，用手指轻轻拂过其熟悉的表面。

Taking a breath, he sat down on the mattress's edge and braced himself for what was to come. Leaning back Shinji did the best he could to get comfortable.  
深吸一口气，他坐在床沿，为自己即将面对的一切做好准备。靠后坐下，真嗣尽可能让自己舒服些。

As he closed his eyes, he let himself succumb to Morpheus' realm and readied himself for the horrors that awaited him.  
当他闭上双眼，任由自己沉入梦神摩耳甫斯的领域，准备迎接即将到来的恐怖。

### Chapter 6:"... Take time with a wounded hand, 'Cause it likes to heal..."

_No sound but the whisper of a light breeze passed through the ruins that the two combatants stood in. No beating of helicopter blades, or whine of jet engines disturbed the two lone giants that stood in the now ruined and burnt out streets of Tokyo-3.  
除了轻风穿过废墟的低语，没有其他声音。没有直升机叶片的拍打声，也没有喷气发动机的嗡鸣声，打扰着站在如今已成废墟和烧毁的东京-3 街道上的两个孤独巨人。_

_With the setting sun, long shadows cast themselves on the ground from the jagged pillars of concrete and steel, seemingly twisted like paper by their fight. Of the buildings that hadn't been retracted to the GeoFront nearly all had been leveled in the AT Field fueled battle that had raged between the Angel of Might and Unit-01.  
随着夕阳西下，长长的影子从混凝土和钢铁的参差不齐的柱子上投射到地面上，仿佛被他们的战斗扭曲得像纸一样。在 AT 力场驱动的战斗中，几乎所有未被撤回地下的建筑都被夷为平地，这场战斗在力量天使和初号机之间激烈展开。_

_Shinji just watched the red bubble of blood as he coughed it up, a stark contrast with the orange LCL. He felt as if this fight was beginning to be the longest he had even had to endure.  
真嗣只是注视着那团咳出的鲜红血泡，与橙色的 LCL 形成鲜明对比。他感觉这场战斗似乎正逐渐成为他不得不忍受的最漫长的一场。_

_Right now, he was eyeing Zeruel, its' 'face' seemed to only mock him for his pitiful attempts at fighting it.  
此刻，他正盯着零尔，它的‘脸’似乎只是在嘲笑他那可怜的反抗尝试。_

_Asuka had been medevacked down to the GeoFront, she would survive, but with the lose of an arm to the Angel's AT field she would be more of a liability, even if she hadn't been subjected to an immense amount of pain.  
明日香已被紧急送往地底都市，她会活下来，但失去了一只手臂，被使徒的 AT 力场所夺，即便没有遭受巨大的痛苦，她也将成为一个负担。_

_Despite their incredible teamwork, being able to fight in sync without any music for the better half of an hour this Zeruel was stronger than those before it. He didn't know why it had to be this way, but he steeled his nerves. The Third Children was exhausted, the fight had been this long only because he had been careful to protect his umbilical cable from being cut via AT Fields.  
尽管他们的团队合作令人难以置信，能够在没有音乐的情况下同步战斗长达半小时，但这次面对的 Zeruel 比之前的都要强大。他不知道为什么会这样，但他坚定了心志。第三适格者已经筋疲力尽，这场战斗之所以持续这么久，只是因为他一直小心翼翼地保护着自己的脐带电缆不被 AT 力场切断。_

"_Shinji, we're discussing an aerial bombardment with N2 Mines, do you have any more ideas?" Misato called to him through the comm link._  
“真嗣，我们在讨论使用 N2 地雷进行空中轰炸，你还有什么想法吗？”美里通过通讯链接向他喊道。

_Taking another gulp of LCL the Third Children leapt aside as the 'arms' of Zeruel came flying towards him, ready to split him in two.  
第三适格者又喝了一口 LCL，随即跳向一旁，Zeruel 的‘手臂’正朝他飞来，准备将他一分为二。_

_Shinji threw out his AT field, slicing off part of the two 'arms' of the Angel, but he wasn't fast enough to dodge all of the field sent at him.  
真嗣展开了他的 AT 力场，切断了使徒的两条'手臂'，但他没能快到避开所有向他袭来的力场。_

_Screaming at the feeling of the lacerations crossing his body, he rolled away, ducking Unit 01 behind a fallen skyscraper.  
他因身体上交错的撕裂感而尖叫，翻滚着躲开，将初号机藏在一座倒塌的摩天大楼后。_

"_Shinji can you hear me. Shinji!?"_  
“真嗣，你能听到吗？真嗣！？”

_He ignored her, instead focusing on his LCL flowing freely into the street, it was now or never.  
他无视了她，转而专注于他的 LCL 自由地流入街道，现在是决定性的时刻。_

"_Hey Misato?" he said quietly._  
“嘿，美里？”他轻声说道。

"_Shinji, are you alright?" panic had crept into her voice despite her effort to hide it, but the boy just closed his eyes._  
“真嗣，你还好吗？”尽管她努力掩饰，恐慌还是悄悄爬进了她的声音，但男孩只是闭上了眼睛。

"_Tell Kaji how you feel alright?"_  
"告诉真嗣你的感受，好吗？"

_Before he could get a response the boy reached down deep within the EVA he knew exactly where to look for the other presence in there with him.  
在他得到回应之前，男孩深入到 EVA 的内部，他清楚地知道在哪里寻找与他同在的那个存在。_

_Let's do this Yui. 让我们开始吧，唯。_

_With that last thought, he stood up and charged the Angel.  
带着这最后的念头，他站起身来，向使徒发起了冲锋。_

_Deep in the EVA, he felt the other presence stir, shock was perhaps the most prevalent emotion he felt from her, but then happiness, joy, love, worry, and confusion.  
在 EVA 的深处，他感觉到另一个存在的动静，震惊或许是她最主要的情绪，但随后是喜悦、欢乐、爱意、担忧和困惑。_

_She could see him, she could feel him, and she knew that he was not exactly_ her _Shinji._  
她能看到他，能感受到他，她知道他并非完全是自己心中的真嗣。

_And that didn't matter to her.  
这对她来说无关紧要。_

_To the Angel's credit, Shinji would've been surprised at the charge as well, it wasn't as if they had been fighting very close this entire time after all.  
值得称赞的是，天使的这一举动，真嗣也会感到惊讶，毕竟他们并非一直近身搏斗。_

_Equipping his Progressive knife, Shinji dove down below the last bits of arm launched his way, before tearing into the Angel's AT field. He imagined down in the GeoFront, the command center was staring in shock at his sync ratio, which to them should be skyrocketing.  
真嗣装备上他的高振动粒子刀，俯冲避开最后几块向他袭来的手臂，然后撕裂了天使的 AT 力场。他想象着在 GeoFront 的指挥中心，工作人员正震惊于他同步率的飙升，对他们来说这应该是突飞猛进的。_

_Climbing up, he ripped the arms off at their base, throwing the tendrils to the floor.  
他攀爬而上，将那些触手从根部扯断，扔到地板上。_

_Warmth seemed to envelope him, reaching out to his mind, calling him.  
温暖似乎包围了他，伸向他的心灵，呼唤着他。_

Thank you, Mom. 谢谢你，妈妈。

_But he had to resist, for now at least, he couldn't afford to merge with the core.  
但他必须克制，至少现在，他承受不起与核心融合的代价。_

_Leaning in, the eye of the Angel's face seemed to spark with life, and just like the first time, his left arm was sliced away, a bit higher than before but he knew that pain, it wasn't anything he couldn't deal with.  
他倾身向前，天使的面容似乎因生命而闪耀，一如初次，他的左臂被切断，比之前稍高一些，但他熟悉那种痛楚，那并非他无法承受的。_

_Instead, he just brought his good arm up and smashing his fist down onto the Angels chest.  
相反，他只是抬起完好的手臂，猛地一拳砸向天使的胸膛。_

_Over and over and over again.  
一遍又一遍，一遍又一遍。_

_*Bang* *砰*_

_*Bang* *砰*_

_*Bang* *砰*_

_Breaking apart 'bone' and 'flesh' from his opponent it didn't take long before he was to the core, and with one last punch…  
他将对手的'骨'与'肉'一一剥离，没过多久便触及核心，最后一拳……_

_A flash of white enveloped him...  
一道白光将他吞没……_

He opened his eyes, only to see Misato's wide-eyed face.  
他睁开眼睛，映入眼帘的是美里瞪大的脸庞。

ʡʘʢ

_*BANG* *砰*_

Misato groaned, annoyed to be stirred from her slumber.  
美里咕哝着，被从睡梦中吵醒让她感到烦躁。

_*BANG* *砰*_

What was that? The sound rang in her head, but she didn't want to get up, sprawled out on her bed with only a tanktop and shorts on she was too comfortable and too tired.  
那是什么声音？它在她的脑海中回响，但她不想起床，只穿着背心和短裤躺在床上，她太舒服了，也太累了。

_*BANG* *砰*_

Her eyes fluttered open, only to narrow in annoyance at the lack of sunlight entering her room.  
她的眼睑轻轻颤动，睁开眼却因房间内阳光的缺失而皱起了眉头。

_*BANG* *砰*_

Growling, she willed herself up, the sun hadn't even risen yet, only the faintest hint of its arrival pressed against the horizon.  
她低声咆哮，努力起身，太阳甚至还未升起，只有一丝微弱的曙光轻触着地平线。

What was that sound? 那是什么声音？

_*BANG* *砰*_

She grumbled, moaning as joints popped and groaned from sleeping in unusual positions, rubbing her eyes she forced her way to her feet and groggily hobbled towards the door.  
她咕哝着，关节因睡在不寻常的姿势而噼啪作响，她揉着眼睛，强迫自己站起来，踉踉跄跄地朝门口走去。

Sliding it open she squinted into the poorly lit apartment, looking for the source of noise that had so rudely stirred her from her sleep.  
她拉开房门，眯着眼睛望向光线昏暗的公寓，寻找那个粗鲁地将她从睡梦中吵醒的噪音来源。

_*BANG* *砰*_

She walked slowly, steadying herself with one hand on the wall, the nose was coming from the kitchen and she could at least tell it sounded like something on metal.  
她缓缓前行，一手扶着墙壁稳住身形，那股异味显然来自厨房，至少她能听出那声音像是金属上发出的。

Perhaps Pen Pen needed food? Had they fed him before they collapsed into bed?  
或许是 Pen Pen 需要食物了？他们入睡之前喂过他吗？

_*BANG* *砰*_

Turning the corner, she found her answer.  
转过拐角，她找到了答案。

Shinji stood there, at the side of the refrigerator, his back was to her, but he didn't move, he was like a statue.  
真嗣站在冰箱旁，背对着她，一动不动，宛如一尊雕像。

Then… for no reason, he drew back his arm and slammed his fist into the side of the fridge.  
然后……毫无预兆地，他猛地收回手臂，一拳砸向冰箱侧面。

_*BANG* *砰*_

Misato's drowsy brain was doing its best to comprehend what she was watching, but there was nothing it could do, no logical explanation it could reach, no memory it could recall that might explain why Shinji had just punched the fridge.  
美里昏昏欲睡的大脑正竭力理解眼前的一幕，却无能为力，找不到任何合乎逻辑的解释，也想不起任何可能说明真嗣为何会突然打冰箱的记忆。

_*BANG* *砰*_

Or why he did it again.  
或者他为何再次这样做。

"Shinji?" she called to him softly, whether it was from trying to keep from startling him or her own tiredness she didn't know, but Shinji hadn't made one indication he had heard her.  
"真嗣？" 她轻声呼唤他，不知是因为不想吓到他还是因为自己的疲惫，但真嗣没有做出任何他听到的迹象。

_*BANG* *砰*_

Slowly, the commander moved closer, taking each step with slow precise moves.  
指挥官缓缓靠近，每一步都迈得缓慢而精确。

As she closed in, she could see that his knuckles had been bloodied, the skin split open from the contact with the metal. His fist was starting to turn red as his blood seeped into the bandages that had been wrapped around the burns on his palms.  
当她靠近时，她看到他的指节已经血肉模糊，皮肤因与金属接触而裂开。他的拳头开始泛红，血液渗入缠绕在他手掌烧伤处的绷带中。

He pulled his arm back again and this time Misato instinctively reached out to stop him from hurting himself.  
他再次将手臂向后拉，这一次，Misato 本能地伸出手去阻止他自伤。

Grabbing his wrist, she wasn't ready for the swift spin, nor was she ready for the way he lunged at her.  
她抓住他的手腕，却未料到他迅速的转身，也没准备好他向她扑来的方式。

Startled was a bit of an understatement, scared was more appropriate as the small frame of the boy knocked her off balance, forcing her to the ground.  
惊吓这个词都显得有些轻描淡写，恐惧才更为贴切，男孩瘦小的身躯撞得她失去平衡，迫使她跌倒在地。

Doing her best to protect herself from the fall she couldn't do much as he climbed on top of her and brought his fist back again.  
她尽力保护自己免受跌落的伤害，但当他爬到她身上并再次挥拳时，她几乎无能为力。

"SHINJI!" She yelled at him, adrenaline how coursing through her, she could see his face dimly lit by the light coming from the city outside, but it wasn't the boy she knew. His face was contorted in rage, snarling at her.  
“真嗣！”她朝他大喊，肾上腺素在体内奔涌，她能隐约看到他的脸被窗外城市的灯光照亮，但那已不是她所熟悉的男孩。他的脸因愤怒而扭曲，对她咆哮着。

That was the first time she had actually felt afraid of the Third Child.  
那是她第一次真正对第三适格者感到害怕。

But… that moment was fleeting, his face returned to the one she knew, the soft, timid teen that she had brought to NERV looked down at her, confused.  
然而…那一刻转瞬即逝，他的脸恢复了往日的模样，那个她带到 NERV 的温柔、胆怯的少年低头看着她，一脸困惑。

"Misato?" he asked, looking around he seemed to be casing the area, unaware of where he was.  
"美里？" 他问道，环顾四周，似乎在勘察环境，不知道自己身处何地。

"Shinji…" she breathed, just staring at the boy, the rage that had been shown was gone in an instant, his bloodied bandages on his hand the only remaining evidence that he'd even done what she witnessed.  
"真嗣…" 她轻声呼唤，只是凝视着男孩，刚才显露的愤怒瞬间消失无踪，他手上血迹斑斑的绷带是他曾做出她所目睹行为的唯一证据。

The boy pushed himself off her, and fell back onto the ground, the woman pulled herself up looking at him, concern wracking her face.  
男孩从她身上撑起，跌坐在地，女子起身看着他，脸上满是关切之色。

He couldn't bring his eyes to her's, instead he just looked down at the floor, his hands in his lap and head dipped down.  
他无法直视她的眼睛，只是低头盯着地板，双手放在膝上，头低垂着。

"Shinji…" he said softly, reaching out to him.  
“真嗣……”他轻声说道，伸手向他。

His flinch at her touch shouldn't have hurt her as much as it did, but she only moved closer, finally pulling up his hand to the small amount of light int the room.  
他因她的触碰而微微一颤，本不应如此伤人，但她只是更靠近了些，最终将他的手拉至房间里那微弱的光线中。

The bandage on the hand had been bloodied, his knuckles had been cracked open, but judging by his apparent lack of pain, she didn't think they could be broken.  
手上的绷带沾满了血迹，他的指节裂开了口子，但从他那看似无恙的神情来看，她觉得应该没有骨折。

"Hey," she cooed, reaching out for his body and for the second time today she pulled him in close and held him, he still wouldn't look at her, instead she did the talking.  
“嘿，”她温柔地唤道，伸手揽过他的身躯，今日第二次将他紧紧拥入怀中。他依旧不愿看她，于是她便开口说了起来。

"Do you want to talk about it?"  
“你想谈谈这件事吗？”

She heard a sharp breath and for the longest moment she didn't think an answer would come, but eventually it did.  
她听到一声急促的呼吸，那一刻她以为不会有回答了，但最终还是听到了。

"I guess I've never done that here before huh…" he asked, it was barely above a whisper, but it was clear to her in the quietness of her apartment, so was the pain in his voice.  
“我想我以前从没在这里这样做过，是吧…”他问道，声音几乎低不可闻，但在她公寓的寂静中，她听得清清楚楚，他的声音里带着的痛楚也是如此。

He wouldn't grab onto her, she couldn't tell why, but it once again the dull pain in her chest hurt her more than it should.  
他不会抓住她，她说不清为什么，但那种隐隐作痛的感觉再次袭来，比应有的程度更让她心痛。

"What were you dreaming about?" she probed, not really believing he would share. If her own experiences with nightmares were anything to go on, she hadn't told anyone about them since her college days.  
"你在梦什么？" 她试探性地问，并不真的相信他会分享。如果以她自己噩梦的经历为参考，她自大学以来就从未向任何人透露过。

For a long moment he said nothing, he just let her rock him gently back and forth in her harms, his blooded and bandaged hands not even returning her embrace.  
他沉默了许久，只是任由她在怀中轻轻摇晃，他那沾满血迹、缠着绷带的手甚至没有回应她的拥抱。

"Just…." his voice was a hair above a whisper and it cracked before he could continue.  
"只是……" 他的声音几乎细不可闻，话未说完便已沙哑。

"It was a long time ago." he mumbled.  
"那是很久以前的事了。" 他咕哝道。

She figured perhaps at least for this night, she wouldn't ask more questions, no, there would be a time for that later, right now she needed to comfort the child even if he was against the idea.  
她想，也许至少今晚，她不会再问更多问题了，不，以后会有时间问的，现在她需要安慰这个孩子，即使他对此并不情愿。

"I used to do that more often…" Shinji half-heartedly explained "I haven't done that here before, have I?"  
"我以前经常这么做……" 真嗣半心半意地解释道，"我以前在这里没这么做过，对吧？"

She shook her head, aware that he would be able to discern her response. He said nothing, instead they just both sat there on the floor, basking in each other's warmth.  
她摇了摇头，知道他能看出她的回应。他什么也没说，只是两人一起坐在地板上，享受着彼此的温暖。

To her the time went by too fast, the sun's light banished the shadows and darkness from the room as she rocked her ward lightly back and forth.  
对她来说，时间过得太快，阳光驱散了房间里的阴影和黑暗，她轻轻地摇晃着她的守护对象。

Eying the clock that could now be read, she knew she would need to get back to the GeoFront soon.  
瞥了一眼现在能看清的时钟，她知道很快就得返回地底都市了。

"Shinji?" she whispered, but there was no response.  
"真嗣？" 她轻声唤道，但没有回应。

Pulling back from him slightly, she looked down at his peaceful face, eyes closed and breathing softly.  
她微微从他身边退开，低头凝视着他安详的面容，双眼紧闭，呼吸轻柔。

A smile made its way onto her lips. Picking up the boy she took him back to his room and set him down, he had earned the day off from school or medical tests, there would be time for those tomorrow.  
她的唇边不由得浮现出一抹微笑。她抱起男孩，将他带回房间，轻轻放下。他今天可以不用去学校或接受医疗检查，那些事情明天再说吧。

Right now, he needed sleep.  
眼下，他急需睡眠。

So, _just_ _a_s _a h_ead_s_ up, _w_e're _g_o_i_ng t_o_ ma_i_nl_y u_s_e_ t_he N_e_t_fl_ix_ En_gli_s_h_ Dub f_or_ N_G_E a_nd_ EOE material, it's just easier than finding the originals somewhere. The situation with Rebuild is a bit more… interesting since I have access to the Dub versions for 1.0,2.0,3.0, but after watching a Sub version for 2.0 I realized some scenes can have a bit different context due to translation.**  
作者注：如果你还没猜到，这将是一种连接《新世纪福音战士》（NGE）与《福音战士新剧场版》系列之间的故事。实际上，我在 Netflix 上无聊时随机选择观看 NGE 后，已经为此故事工作了大约两个月。所以，提前说明一下，我们将主要使用 Netflix 上的 NGE 和《死与新生》（EOE）的英语配音版，因为这样比找原版更容易。至于《福音战士新剧场版》的情况则稍微复杂些，因为我能接触到 1.0、2.0、3.0 的配音版本，但在看过 2.0 的日语字幕后，我意识到某些场景由于翻译差异可能会有不同的上下文。

**I've decided to manly stick with the English Dub for the majority of the story unless I think the Sub version adds more details/context. That being said, that dialogue will probably have to be reworked just to make it a bit smoother if I take it from the Subs. So just expect a mix of the two going forward.  
我决定在故事的大部分时间里坚持使用英语配音，除非我认为字幕版能增加更多细节/背景。即便如此，如果我从字幕中提取对话，可能需要重新调整以使其更加流畅。所以，接下来请期待两者的混合使用。**

**Now for the elephant in the room. 3.0+1.0 is going to be released in 2 days, what does that mean? Well, I'm still trying to figure that out. I have an ending to this story already worked out, though I doubt we'll get past the events of 2.0 before I have 3.0+1.0 spoiled or read the plot myself. Either way the jury's out on what rewrites will occur or if it will even matter.  
现在来谈谈那个显而易见的问题。《3.0+1.0》将在两天后发布，这意味着什么？嗯，我还在努力弄清楚。我已经为这个故事构思了一个结局，不过我怀疑在我们经历完《2.0》的事件之前，我就会被《3.0+1.0》的剧情剧透或者自己阅读剧情。无论如何，关于是否会有重写或是否重要，目前还不得而知。**

**Shoutouts! 致谢！**

**KySocceRref- Thanks for the two reviews, hope you're enjoying the story so far!  
KySocceRref- 感谢你的两次评论，希望你到目前为止喜欢这个故事！**

**One last thing. Pacing and time. Evangelion isn't exactly the most forthcoming in its' timeframe, even more in Rebuild 2.0 with its' breakneck pacing. I'm going with the timeline of 1.0 starting in November, and 2.0 starting in February, so roughly 3-4 months from the start of 1.0 to 2.0 (give or take a week). Its confusing and its probably not even a big deal, but for my sake I've been trying to figure it out with people's analysis of background details. Pacing will hopefully also slow down as well after the next chapter, or at least that's the plan. 2.0 really just hits the gas without a care, not that it's necessarily a bad thing, its just a lot of the NGE timeframe was condensed into 2.0.  
最后一件事。节奏和时间。《新世纪福音战士》的时间线并不十分明确，尤其是在节奏飞快的 2.0 中。我采用的是 1.0 从 11 月开始，2.0 从 2 月开始的设定，所以大约是从 1.0 开始后的 3-4 个月（前后一周左右）。这很混乱，可能也不是什么大问题，但为了我自己，我一直在尝试根据人们对背景细节的分析来理清它。希望在接下来的chapter之后，节奏也能放缓，至少这是计划。2.0 真的就是毫不犹豫地加速，这并不一定是坏事，只是很多《新世纪福音战士》的时间线被压缩进了 2.0。**

**Apologies for the long Author's Note, but some of these issues I felt needed to be addressed before we kicked off 2.0 and can't really be pointed out in the story without it being a bit jarring. At least in my opinion, besides, I haven't done one for 5 chapters.  
对于这篇冗长的作者按，我深表歉意，但我认为在开启 2.0 版本之前，有些问题必须先解决，而在故事中直接指出这些问题会显得有些突兀。至少在我看来是这样，况且我已经连续五章没有写过作者按了。**

**Until Next Time. 下次见。**

### Chapter 7: "...I'll live, I'll become all I need to be…"

Ritsuko Akagi couldn't sleep.  
赤木律子无法入睡。

NERV's chief scientist was used to burning the midnight oil, her and her coffee machine were old friends, they had made it through college together, then grad school. The thing was almost magic to her, no other coffee machine seemed to give her the same rush of energy.  
NERV 的首席科学家早已习惯了熬夜工作，她和她的咖啡机是老朋友了，他们一起熬过了大学，又一起度过了研究生院。这台咖啡机对她来说几乎有魔力，似乎没有其他咖啡机能给她带来同样的精力激增。

At the moment the thing was dormant, tucked neatly away from prying eyes, with its' black tendril-like stains that signaled its years of use. No, coffee was the last thing she needed, she was doing her best to fall asleep right now, the day's tole finally coming due.  
此刻，那东西正处于休眠状态，巧妙地隐藏在窥探的视线之外，其黑色的触须般的污渍标志着它多年的使用。不，咖啡是她最不需要的东西，她正竭尽全力入睡，白日的疲惫终于到了偿还的时刻。

She sat at her desk with stacks of paper strewn about, slouched in her chair and a file open in her hands.  
她坐在桌前，四周散落着成堆的文件，懒洋洋地靠在椅子上，手中摊开着一份档案。

Shinji Ikari 碇真嗣

The Third Child 第三子

Pilot of Evangelion Unit-01  
福音战士初号机驾驶员

Born: 2001 出生年份：2001 年

Deceased: 2015 已故：2015 年

Current Status: Alive 当前状态：存活

The records would be changed of course, outside of rumors spread by NERV personal to other branches, any official records of the incident would be wiped.  
当然，记录会被修改，除了 NERV 人员向其他分支散布的谣言外，任何官方的该事件记录都将被抹除。

The blonde rubbed her eyes under her glasses. Was she the only one losing her mind over this?  
金发女子在眼镜下揉了揉眼睛。难道只有她一个人为此发疯吗？

The commander seemed apathetic about his son's wellbeing, as long as he could pilot, he was perfectly fine. She hadn't had time to chitchat with Misato about the seeming death and resurrection of their favorite introvert, but while his body was cooling off in the morgue her violet haired friend was clearly hiding her emotional turmoil.  
指挥官似乎对他的儿子的安危漠不关心，只要他能驾驶，就一切都好。她还没来得及和美里闲聊关于他们最喜欢的内向者看似死亡又复活的谜团，但当他的遗体在太平间冷却时，她那紫发的朋友显然在隐藏内心的情感风暴。

Emotional Turmoil… 情感风暴…

What a professional way of saying 'eating themselves up because they got a kid killed' or 'trying not to have an emotional breakdown while an Angel is attacking.'.  
这真是一种专业的说法，‘因为害死了一个孩子而自我折磨’或者‘在使徒攻击下努力不情绪崩溃’。

It wasn't like Ritsuko could blame her old friend, she'd been there right by her side and it wasn't something she'd be forgetting soon.  
丽津子不能怪她的老朋友，她一直就在她身边，这件事她也不会很快忘记。

Those screams… 那些尖叫声……

But the boy had been dead, with a capital D. No pulse, no brainwaves, nothing. A rapidly cooling corpse.  
但那个男孩确实死了，彻底的死。没有脉搏，没有脑电波，什么都没有。一具迅速冷却的尸体。

Then six hours later… poof, Shinji Ikari was back to the world of the living and his sync ratio had skyrocketed.  
然后六小时后……嘭，碇真嗣重返人间，同步率直线飙升。

From what little she saw of the boy, she half expected him to die again from suffocation as Misato practically orbited around the Third Child. Two pieces of matter can't exist in the same space? Misato was trying _very_ hard to break that law of physics.  
从她对这男孩的有限了解来看，她几乎以为他会再次因窒息而死，因为美里几乎围着第三适格者转。两个物体不能同时占据同一空间？美里正努力打破这一物理定律。

To Ritsuko, it was jaring seeing her friend that way, Misato Katsuragi had always kept people at arms length. She never quite let herself get attached to those around her, that had been obvious to her since their time in college. That was with one exception of course.  
对律子来说，看到她的朋友这样令人不安，葛城美里总是与人保持距离。她从未真正让自己与周围的人过于亲近，这在大学时期就已显而易见。当然，除了一个例外。

Apart from a quick briefing she didn't have a chance to interact with or examine him until after they were picked up and brought back to the GeoFront.  
除了简短的介绍，她直到他们被接走并带回地底都市 GeoFront 后，才有机会与他互动或仔细观察他。

There had been no time, some nurse had done a quick checkup and then they had to send him back out there to fight the Sixth Angel.  
当时根本没有时间，某个护士匆匆做了个检查，然后他们就不得不把他送回去对抗第六使徒。

Afterwards she was tasked with bandaging his hands or more accurately, she made sure it was _her_ bandaging his hands.  
事后，她的任务是包扎他的双手，或者更确切地说，是她确保由她来包扎他的双手。

The whole act of him prying open Rei's entry pod was a bit too 'father like son' for her to think nothing of it, but there was nothing _to_ do but dwell on it. Perhaps deep down the younger Ikari was exactly like his father, he just kept it hidden under a _very_ introverted shell.  
他撬开零的逃生舱这一整套动作，对她来说有点过于‘父如子’了，让她无法不放在心上，但除了深思别无他法。或许在内心深处，这位年轻的碇君和他的父亲如出一辙，只是他将这一切隐藏在一个极其内向的外壳之下。

When she sat there, wrapping his hands in gauze, she knew something was off. Neither had said a word except for a quick 'thank you', but she could tell, be it some sort of sixth sense or years of scientific curiosity, the boy was not the same.  
当她坐在那里，用纱布包扎他的手时，她感觉到有些不对劲。两人除了简短的一句‘谢谢’外，没有多说一句话，但她能感觉到，无论是某种第六感还是多年科学好奇心的驱使，这个男孩已经不再是原来的他了。

How was he different? That still alluded her.  
他究竟有何不同？这一点仍然让她困惑。

But by the way the hairs on the back of her neck stood up while she bandaged him, she knew something was off, perhaps just one degree but it was enough for her to notice.  
但当她为他包扎时，颈后的毛发竖起，她感觉到有些不对劲，或许只是偏差了一度，但足以让她察觉到。

Throwing the file down, she picked up another one, once again her brain shifted back to finding a cause for the boy's sudden return from the afterlife.  
她扔下文件，又拿起另一份，脑海中再次转回到寻找男孩突然从死后世界归来的原因上。

LCL

That was the only logical answer that her brain could come to. Perhaps it was simply forcing LCL to be the answer just so she wouldn't go crazy with the notion that it was quite literally an act of god that had brought Shinji Ikari back to the mortal plane.  
这是她的大脑能得出的唯一合理解释。或许它只是强迫 LCL 成为答案，以免她因认为这实际上是神的作为而将碇真嗣带回人间而发疯。

From NERV's own research they knew it had (albeit small) positive effects on the human body. Typically, most test subjects had found it to be rather refreshing (after they got over the smell and taste of course). Test subjects had performed better in physical activity after being exposed to the red fluid, though it was marginal at best and varied from person to person.  
从 NERV 自己的研究中，他们知道它（尽管效果微小）对人体有积极影响。通常，大多数测试对象在克服了气味和味道之后，会觉得它相当提神。暴露在红色液体中的测试对象在体力活动中表现更好，尽管这种改善微乎其微，且因人而异。

But no one had ever _died_ in it, let alone submerged in it and inside and EVA.  
但从未有人在其中丧生，更不用说完全沉浸其中并身处 EVA 内部了。

Her mind kept spinning, then it hit her.  
她的思绪不断旋转，突然间灵光一闪。

The lungs. 肺部。

After extracting the boy from his half-melted entry plug, they had simply cut open his plug suit to search for a pulse. A defibrillator wasn't going to do them any good if there wasn't a heartbeat, which there was none.  
在将男孩从半熔化的驾驶舱中救出后，他们只是割开了他的驾驶服寻找脉搏。如果没有心跳，除颤器也无济于事，而当时确实没有心跳。

Standard procedure had the body stripped and put into quarantine for 24 hours… so no chance for an autopsy, no chance to drain the body, and no chance to empty the lungs.  
按照标准程序，遗体会被剥光衣物并隔离 24 小时……因此无法进行尸检，无法排干体内液体，也无法清理肺部。

Did those LCL filled lungs save the boy? Somehow keep his tissue from deteriorating while eventually bringing him back to the world of the living? Could his inflated sync rate be the result of having LCL be infused into his body?  
那些充满 LCL 的肺是否救了那个男孩？是否以某种方式阻止了他的组织腐烂，同时最终将他带回了活人的世界？他飙升的同步率是否源于 LCL 融入体内的结果？

A part of her wanted to jump at the idea, stand on the desk and proclaim her explanation to the world in triumph. The other part of her wanted to beat that part of her over the head with a stupid stick. This was completely outside the realm of anything the red goo had been observed capable of before, why was she jumping to conclusions?  
她的一部分想要欣然接受这个想法，站在桌子上向全世界得意地宣布她的解释。而另一部分则想用一根愚蠢的棍子敲打那部分自己。这完全超出了之前观察到的红色粘液所能做到的范围，她为何如此急于下结论？

To satisfy her own person turmoil, of course.  
当然是为了平息她内心的纷乱。

Throwing that folder onto the desk as well, she leaned in and rested her head on a stack of papers. That was enough of an explanation to permit her some sleep tonight. Tomorrow she'd be able to poke and prod the boy all she wanted, permitting his suddenly very overprotective guardian allowed for it.  
她也将那文件夹扔到桌上，身子前倾，头靠在一堆文件上。这样的解释足以让她今晚安心入睡。明天，只要那个突然变得过度保护的监护人允许，她就可以随心所欲地对那男孩进行探究。

For now, the world slightly shifted back to where it was before she had to think about a literal zombie piloting an Evangelion.  
眼下，世界似乎稍稍回到了她不得不考虑一个驾驶着 EVA 的僵尸之前的状态。

And that was enough for her to finally sleep.  
对她来说，这就足够让她终于能安然入睡了。

ʡʘʢ

As the boy's eyes opened, Shinji Ikari knew one thing.  
当男孩睁开眼睛时，碇真嗣明白了一件事。

He had gotten the best sleep he had in quite some time.  
他已经有很长一段时间没有睡得这么好了。

Stretching he felt joints pop as his head fell into his hands, rubbing his face he found himself just sitting there, remembering the dreams, no memories that had come to him in the night.  
他伸了个懒腰，关节咔咔作响，头埋进双手中，揉着脸颊，发现自己只是坐在那里，回想着夜里浮现的梦境，那些并非记忆的片段。

Then the lack there of.  
然后就是缺失的部分。

Looking over at his clock he saw what time it was, 8 am, he figured Misato had simply let him off of going to school.  
他瞥了一眼时钟，看到时间已经是早上 8 点，心想美里大概已经让他不用去上学了。

Not that it would matter much anyways.  
反正也没多大关系。

The events of last night came rushing back to him. Closing his eyes, he took a deep breath, trying not to worry about the fact he had nearly punched Misato.  
昨晚的事件如潮水般涌回他的脑海。他闭上双眼，深吸一口气，努力不去担心自己差点揍了美里这件事。

Dragging himself to his feet, he ignored the specter lurking in the shadows and made his way to the bathroom.  
他艰难地站起身，无视潜伏在阴影中的幽灵，向浴室走去。

With some water splashed onto his face, the boy leaned on the sink, trying to ignore the bleeding redhead that hovered behind him in the mirror.  
男孩往脸上泼了些水，靠在洗手台上，试图忽视镜中映出的那个流血的红发身影。

"I am Shinji Ikari…" he mumbled to himself "Third Children, Pilot of Evangelion Unit-01…"  
“我是碇真嗣……”他喃喃自语，“第三适格者，EVA 初号机的驾驶员……”

How does one keep their sanity when they've been pitched through time and space? Even he wasn't completely sure he was, after all the Third Children did have an invisible hitchhiker with him.  
当一个人被抛入时空的漩涡中，该如何保持理智？毕竟，就连他也不完全确定自己是否还正常，毕竟第三适格者确实有个看不见的旅伴。

"_You know, now_ she _has to worry about your stupid nightmares to."_  
“你知道吗，现在她还得担心你的那些愚蠢的噩梦。”

He nodded but wouldn't look at her.  
他点点头，却不愿看她。

"If you had told me about yours, we might not be here." he grumbled.  
“如果你早些告诉我你的秘密，我们或许不会陷入这种境地。”他咕哝着。

He had had a _long_ time to think over things that could have gone better, a long time to torture himself about how _he_ could have been better.  
他有很长的时间去反思那些本可以处理得更好的事情，有很长的时间去折磨自己，思考如何能做得更好。

Squashing those thoughts cold he looked back into the mirror, despite the few hours of peaceful sleep he'd received there were still dark bags under his eyes. If he went down that road _again_ he'd be in for plenty of more exhaustion filled mornings.  
他强行压下那些思绪，再次望向镜子，尽管已获得几个小时的安宁睡眠，眼下的黑圈依旧清晰可见。若再踏上那条路，迎接他的将是更多疲惫不堪的清晨。

Here was the best chance in a long time to make things right, he wasn't going to waste this one.  
这是很长一段时间以来最好的机会来弥补一切，他不会浪费这次机会。

Shinji finished his routine and stepped out into the kitchen to begin preparing a brunch for himself. Perhaps he could whip up a nice dinner for Misato as an apology for his antics the previous night.  
真嗣完成了日常事务，走进厨房开始为自己准备早午餐。或许他可以为美里做一顿美味的晚餐，以表达昨晚自己胡闹的歉意。

Before he could get started though he noticed the blinking light on the messaging machine. Knowing it most likely be his guardian, he hit play.  
然而，在他开始之前，他注意到了留言机上的闪烁灯。知道很可能是他的监护人，他按下了播放键。

"Hey Shinji, hope you slept in a little, I couldn't convince Ritsuko to let you out of testing for the morning. So some Section 2 personnel will be around at eleven to pick you up, we can grab some lunch before Rits decides to go all Frankenstein ok? See you then!"  
“嘿，真嗣，希望你多睡了一会儿，我没能说服律子让你早上不用测试。所以第二部门的人会在十一点左右来接你，我们可以在律子决定变成弗兰肯斯坦之前一起吃个午饭，好吗？到时候见！”

With a long beep the messaging machine finished its recording.  
随着一声长长的哔声，留言机完成了录音。

The Third Children understood the joke and to anyone else it would have been mildly amusing. But to him, well… in some less fortunate lives he'd been subjected to more than just a brain scan.  
第三适格者理解了这个笑话，对其他人来说可能只是略微有趣。但对他而言，唉……在某些不那么幸运的人生中，他所经历的远不止一次脑部扫描。

Figuring he had time to cook them both a nice lunch, he went about scouring the fridge for ingredients. The lives where he wasn't praised for his culinary skills were few and far between. He didn't even know why he was good at it, with musical instruments he had the time to practice and become good that way. Perhaps when this was all over, _if_ this could ever _be_ over, he'd try his hand at being a chief.  
想着还有时间给他们俩做一顿美味的午餐，他开始在冰箱里翻找食材。那些没有因为厨艺受到赞扬的日子屈指可数。他甚至不知道自己为何擅长烹饪，对于乐器，他还有时间练习并以此方式精通。也许这一切结束后，如果这一切能结束的话，他会尝试成为一名厨师。

ʡʘʢ

The violet-haired director of operations just eyed the chief medical doctor with distain.  
紫发的作战部长只是轻蔑地瞥了一眼首席医疗官。

Currently the two of them sat separated from the Third Child, who was currently laid out and waiting to be put through a CT machine.  
此刻，他们两人与第三适格者隔离开来，后者正躺着等待进行 CT 扫描。

First it was a routine physical, then it was blood tests, then Rits had the boy doing physical exercises to compare to the baseline taken when he joined NERV.  
先是例行体检，接着是血液检测，然后律子让少年进行体能训练，以便与加入 NERV 时的基准数据进行对比。

That right hand had been concerning to her. When asked, Misato had said the boy did it while cooking for the two of them, which the scientist didn't believe for a second, but trying to get information out of the woman while she was sober was near impossible if she wasnt willing to tell.  
那只右手一直让她感到不安。当被问及时，美里说是男孩为他们俩做饭时不小心弄的，但这位科学家一秒钟都不相信，只是想从清醒的美里口中套出信息，如果她不愿意说，几乎是不可能的。

So they went on like nothing had happened. Four hours worth of tests, scans, you name it, she made him go through with it. Shinji, bless the boy, hadn't said a word, hadn't grumbled or bemoaned his predicament. No, he did everything the good doctor asked without question.  
于是他们就这样继续，仿佛什么都没发生过。四个小时的检查、扫描，应有尽有，她让他一一经历。真嗣，愿这孩子安好，一言不发，没有抱怨或哀叹自己的处境。不，他毫无异议地完成了医生要求的一切。

Actually… he had been a bit too quiet.  
实际上……他安静得有些过分了。

That was until they had sprawled him out on that table and hooked wires up to him. Then things got very interesting.  
直到他们把他摊开在那张桌子上，接上电线，事情才变得非常有趣。

"You see this?" Ritsuko pointed to the screen, which Misato barely glanced at.  
“你看到这个了吗？”律子指着屏幕，美里只是匆匆瞥了一眼。

"Just tell me what you're thinking Rits." Misato mumbled, as she took another sip of coffee.  
“直接告诉我你在想什么，律子。”美里咕哝着，又喝了一口咖啡。

Damn… something in that blonde's old coffee machine was magic.  
该死……那金发女郎的老咖啡机里肯定有什么魔法。

"Why is his heartrate accelerated?" she asked, from her seat.  
“为什么他的心率加快了？”她坐在座位上问道。

Misato rolled her eyes "Gee, I don't know, maybe it's something to do with making him jump through hoops for the last couple of hours."  
美里翻了个白眼，“哎呀，我不知道，可能是因为让他跳了几个小时的圈圈吧。”

The scientist rolled her eyes. "His heartrate was never this high when we went through these tests before. You saw his vitals during his last sortie, they barely elevated till the end, once Rei was taking the brunt of the Angels attack."  
科学家翻了个白眼。“他以前做这些测试时心率从没这么高过。你看过他上次出击的生理数据，几乎到最后一刻才有所上升，那时零已经在承受使徒的攻击了。”

"Your point?" “你想说什么？”

Taking off her glasses, sighing, Ritsuko's eyes bore into her friends. "Are you even going to question why Shinji is alive?"  
摘下眼镜，叹了口气，律子的目光直视着她的朋友。“你难道不打算质疑一下真嗣为什么还活着吗？”

She just had to rub salt in that fresh wound, didn't she?  
她非得在那个新伤口上撒盐，不是吗？

Instantly those brown eyes narrowed over that coffee mug. Ritsuko hadn't seen that glare since the girl and a certain someone had gone their separate ways.  
那双棕色的眼睛立刻透过咖啡杯眯了起来。自从那女孩和某人分道扬镳后，律子就没再见过这种瞪视。

Now she was its' target.  
现在她成了目标。

"No… no I'm not going to question it Rits." She said softly. "I'm not going to spend hours thinking about _why_ I… _he_ got this second chance." Placing the mug down on the table, she took a breath and closed her eyes.  
"不……不，我不会去质疑的，Rits。" 她轻声说道，"我不会花上几个小时去思考为什么我……他得到了这个第二次机会。" 她将杯子放在桌上，深吸一口气，闭上了眼睛。

"I don't want to know. Is it too much to not look this gift horse in the mouth?"  
"我不想知道。难道非得要挑剔这份天赐的礼物吗？"

"It is when he's piloting the most destructive weapon created by mankind."  
"当他驾驶着人类创造的最具毁灭性的武器时，确实如此。"

The director of operations nodded, that was a fair point, but still…  
行动主任点了点头，这话有道理，但还是……

"I can still hear his screams Rits." She said softly, turning and looking out the glass at the boy. Wrapping her arms around herself she shivered as some chill went through her.  
"我还能听到他的尖叫，Rits。" 她轻声说道，转身望向窗外那个男孩。她双臂环抱自己，一阵寒意袭来，不禁打了个寒颤。

"When I'm alone and I think about _why?_ I just hear him…" she stopped, the words catching in her throat. "Maybe there doesn't need to be one."  
"当我独自一人，思考这一切是为什么时？我耳边只有他的声音……" 她顿住了，话语哽在喉咙里。"或许，并不需要什么理由。"

The woman still refused to look down at her and Ritsuko finally understood.  
那女人依旧不肯低头看她，丽津子终于明白了。

She _didn't_ care. She didn't care what had brought him back, she didn't care if the reason was scientific or divine, she didn't care about any theories the blonde could offer her or any ramifications that could present themselves should there be more… malicious forces at work.  
她不在乎。她不在乎是什么让他回来的，不在乎原因是否科学或神圣，不在乎金发女子能提供什么理论，也不在乎如果有更多……恶意的力量在作祟，会有什么后果。

No, Misato Katsuragi only cared that the boy was _alive_, the answer as to _how_ was utterly inconsequential to her.  
不，葛城美里只在乎那个男孩还活着，至于他是如何复生的，对她来说毫无意义。

The doctor just nodded, mostly to herself, and placed her glasses back on. Turning back to the computer screen, the machine was ready. With a few keystrokes she initialized the test and as the boy was drawn into the machine, she noted the increased heartrate, but said nothing.  
医生只是点了点头，主要是自言自语，然后重新戴上了眼镜。她转回电脑屏幕，机器已经准备就绪。敲击几下键盘，她启动了测试，当男孩被吸入机器时，她注意到心率加快，但并未出声。

The boy didn't make a single motion that indicated he was about to freak out or experience a panic attack (even if all his vitals said he was), so the doctor let this sleeping dog lay. She'd continue to dwell on the subject later.  
男孩没有任何动作表明他即将崩溃或经历恐慌发作（尽管所有生命体征都显示他处于这种状态），所以医生决定不去打扰。她打算稍后再深入思考这个问题。

She just prayed that there wasn't a price to be paid for not confronting it now.  
她只是祈祷，现在不去面对它不会有什么代价。

ʡʘʢ

The Third Children had never been so happy to be in Misato's car while she was behind the wheel.  
第三适格者们从未如此庆幸能在美里驾驶的车里。

A few hours of being prodded like some new object by Ristuko had left his exhausted. Whether it was the near constant reminder of what the good doctor had done to him in previous lives or the mocking by his personal invisible tormentor, the day had left his exhausted.  
被律子像对待新奇物品一样摆弄了几个小时后，他感到筋疲力尽。无论是前世那位好医生对他所做的一切不断提醒，还是那位看不见的私人折磨者对他的嘲弄，这一天都让他疲惫不堪。

Misato luckily hadn't questioned the food he had brought with him. He made sure to keep it simple, remembering that he wasn't supposed to have memories of cooking food for her here.  
幸运的是，美里没有对他的食物提出质疑。他确保保持简单，记得在这里他不应该有为她烹饪的记忆。

She had simply smiled and said he'd be a great cook one day, before scarfing down (what to her was) a delicacy.  
她只是微笑着说，他总有一天会成为一位出色的厨师，然后大口吃下（对她来说）的美味佳肴。

Once they were back at the apartment, Misato went off to take her daily relaxing bath, while Shinji went about making dinner.  
一回到公寓，美里便去享受她每日的放松泡澡，而真嗣则开始准备晚餐。

Opening the fridge to the wall of cans he half considered trying to ween the woman off her nightly alcoholic tendencies. Apart from her expected lack of cooperation, deep down Shinji knew there was another answer as to why he didn't go about getting the woman dry.  
打开冰箱，面对着一整墙的罐装啤酒，他半心半意地考虑过要帮那女人戒掉每晚的酒精依赖。除了她预期的缺乏合作外，深藏心底，真嗣知道他未曾着手让女人戒酒还有另一个原因。

It let him get away with things.  
这让他得以逍遥法外。

When your guardian is half asleep by 9pm because she's been drinking since she got home, it was rather easy to explain some of the things he might get caught doing as her own drunken imagination the next day.  
当你的监护人晚上 9 点就因从回家起一直喝酒而半睡不醒时，第二天很容易就能把一些可能被抓到的事情解释为她自己的酒后幻觉。

If he ever needed to slip out of the apartment, he wouldn't need to worry about her, just the Section 2 personnel. There was also the fact that she knew about Lilith and how much knowledge she had of NERV's true goal was still unknown to him.  
如果他需要悄悄离开公寓，他不必担心她，只需顾虑第二分部的成员。此外，她还知道莉莉丝的存在，以及她对 NERV 真正目标的了解程度，对他来说仍是个未知数。

Right now it was better this way.  
眼下这样更好。

It was selfish, he knew, but it was also for the greater good. He had used that excuse plenty of times for plenty of things that he was sure he'd pay for one day.  
他知道这是自私的，但也是为了更大的利益。他曾多次用这个借口为许多事情开脱，确信有一天会为此付出代价。

"_Oh, I'm sure all those things were 'for the greater good'." She called out from the living room couch._  
“哦，我敢肯定那些都是‘为了更大的利益’。”她从客厅的沙发上喊道。

Wait... they had a couch now?  
等等……他们现在有沙发了？

"_Remember the time you used Unit-01 to go on a rampage through the GeoFront, I'm sure that was 'for the greater good'."_  
"记得那次你用初号机在 GeoFront 大闹一场，我敢肯定那是‘为了更大的利益’。"

He closed his eyes and did his best to ignore her jab, before setting the table for dinner.  
他闭上眼睛，尽力忽视她的讽刺，然后开始布置晚餐的餐桌。

It had been a rather quite afair, with only small talk between the two of them about his schooling and the friends he had made since arriving to Tokyo-3.  
那是一个相当平静的场合，两人之间只有关于他在东京-3 的学习和他结交的朋友的闲聊。

He found his dreams slightly less horrific after a hug from Misato before bed. He couldn't tell if it was more for him or for her guilt-ridden mind. Though he also didn't know how much the alcohol had to do with it as well to be honest.  
他在睡前得到美里的一次拥抱后，发现自己的梦境稍稍不那么可怕了。他分不清这更多是为了他，还是为了她那充满愧疚的心灵。不过老实说，他也不确定酒精在其中起了多大作用。

He was distinctly reminded about month long stay inside Unit-01, and how beaten down Misato had been after he opened his eyes.  
他清晰地想起了在初号机内长达一个月的停留，以及当他睁开眼后，美里是如何憔悴不堪。

The Third Children made sure to squeeze her back and give her more reassurance it wasn't her fault, the only response he got was an almost inaudible sob and a tighter hug, but it eventually had to end.  
第三适格者确保用力回抱她，并给予更多安慰，告诉她这不是她的错，但得到的回应只是几乎听不见的抽泣和一个更紧的拥抱，不过这一切终究得结束。

Instead of sleepwalking he got to experience another less violent failing of his, one that made his feel a thousand times heavier when getting out of bed.  
他没有梦游，而是经历了一种不那么暴力的失败，这种失败让他起床时感觉身体沉重了千倍。

He made a quick breakfast, said a quick goodbye to a half-asleep Misato, and was out the door just as Toji and Kensuke made it to their apartment complex floor.  
他迅速做了早餐，匆匆向半睡半醒的美里道别，就在铃和真嗣到达他们公寓楼层时，他已出门离去。

All three of them froze to process the moment, before his two friends shot themselves at the 14-year-old. A series of congratulations, thanks, and one manly tear later, they had to begin their trek to school.  
三人齐齐愣住，消化着这一刻，随后他的两个朋友猛地扑向了那位 14 岁的少年。一连串的祝贺、感谢，还有一滴男子汉的泪水之后，他们不得不开始前往学校的路程。

They were off, walking to school through a route that he could literally close his eyes and still follow.  
他们出发了，沿着一条他闭上眼睛也能跟随的路线走向学校。

"So did you hear the news?" Kensuke asked, with his patented devilish smirk.  
“那么，你听到消息了吗？”健介问道，带着他那标志性的狡黠微笑。

Toji just frowned at the boy "He's been gone the last few days, of course he hasn't."  
真嗣只是皱着眉对那男孩说：“他这几天都不在，当然没见过。”

Shinji shook his head with a smile, it was refreshing to see these two again.  
真嗣笑着摇了摇头，再次见到这两人真是令人心情舒畅。

"Just tell me." “告诉我吧。”

Kensuke stopped, turning and grabbed the boy's shirt.  
健介停下脚步，转身抓住了男孩的衬衫。

"Two words. Spring. Dance."  
“两个词。春。舞。”

Shinji looked over to Toji, who shrugged and nodded. "They told us it's being planned, nothing else, they don't even have a date yet."  
真嗣看向了东治，后者耸耸肩点了点头。“他们告诉我们正在筹备，别的什么都没说，连日期都还没定。”

Turning to the larger boy, Kensuke stuck out his finger, "That's not the point, girls from all over the school are going to be looking for dates, that means us!"  
转向高大的男孩，健介伸出手指，“问题不在这里，全校的女生都会找舞伴，那就意味着我们也有机会！”

The thought of seeing Toji and Hikari dressed up and together did intrigue him. He wasn't a matchmaker though, for all his experience, that wasn't something he knew.  
想到能看到真嗣和光一起盛装出席，确实让他感到好奇。但他并非红娘，尽管经验丰富，这种事他并不擅长。

The need to save the jock's arm and leg now became even more prevalent. He _would_ be walking for that night, Shinji would make sure of that.  
现在，拯救这位运动员的胳膊和腿变得更为迫切。那晚他必须能走，真嗣会确保这一点。

As they continued their route, the two boys went and continued retelling all the completely unimportant details of the days he was absent.  
随着他们继续前行，两个男孩又开始复述他缺席期间那些完全无关紧要的日常细节。

Shinji couldn't help the small smile that rose at the end of his lips. Nor could he ignore the warmth that he felt in his chest.  
真嗣忍不住嘴角微微上扬的微笑，也无法忽视胸中涌起的那股暖意。

This world… it was, warmer? Not in the sense that it was physically hotter, no, it just felt… better.  
这个世界……它，更温暖了？并非指物理上的温度更高，不，只是感觉……更好了。

Like it was unaware of its impending doom, that the people everywhere were happier, more alive.  
仿佛它未曾察觉即将到来的厄运，周遭的人们都更加快乐，生机勃勃。

It felt, brighter. 感觉更明亮了。

And the boy could help but allow himself to half-embrace it, even if it was only a little while.  
那男孩不禁让自己半拥着它，哪怕只是片刻。

"_You'll regret that." she heard whispered in his ear, keeping pace with the stooges._  
“你会后悔的。”她听到耳边低语，与那些跟班保持同步。

_I know. 我知道。_

ʡʘʢ

Days passed into weeks, before the familiar routine once again took him.  
日子一天天过去，直到熟悉的日常再次将他包围。

That was before Misato had driven him here.  
那是美里开车带他来之前的事了。

It was too early for this, much too early for him to be on this baren hillside, looking out over the seemingly infinite poles marking individual graves.  
现在还太早，对他来说，在这荒凉的山坡上，眺望着似乎无边无际的墓碑，还为时过早。

He hadn't even stopped Jet Alone yet, but here he was.  
他甚至还没来得及阻止 Jet Alone，就已经身在此处了。

The Third Children had been completely blindsided when she had reminded him and had done everything he could to get out of this.  
第三子在她提醒他时完全措手不及，并尽其所能试图摆脱这一局面。

Much to her confusion. 令她颇为困惑。

Then he had to learn she had been _ordered_ to drive him here, directly from the commander himself. She had even forced him to pick up a bundle of flowers that Shinji had half the mind to throw out the window.  
然后他得知，她被指挥官亲自下令载他来此。她甚至逼他捡起一束花，而真嗣差点就想把它们扔出窗外。

He hated this place. 他讨厌这个地方。

It brought back too many bad memories, memories that didn't need to be remembered, they only forced him to relive his own failures that put him in this mess.  
这里勾起了太多糟糕的回忆，那些本不该被记起的记忆，只是迫使他重新经历那些导致他陷入困境的失败。

As his feet crunched the red soil, he only focused on that singular figure. A black mass towering over all other slim metal polls.  
当他的脚步踩在红土上发出嘎吱声时，他的注意力只集中在那个单一的身影上。一个黑色的庞然大物，高耸于所有细长的金属杆之上。

He didn't want to be here, it was pointless, just another means for Gendo to try and control him, but he had no choice apparently.  
他并不想待在这里，这毫无意义，只是碇源堂试图控制他的另一种手段，但显然他别无选择。

At least he could see if the NERV commander was any different.  
至少他可以看看这位 NERV 指挥官是否有所不同。

Coming up behind the man, he tossed the bundle of flowers into the dirt, in front of the fake grave.  
他走到那人身后，将一束鲜花扔进泥土中，落在那座假墓前。

"Misato forced me to bring these here, it's a waste."  
"Misato 非要我带这些来，真是浪费。"

The man hadn't turned to face him yet, instead he kept his eyes fixated on that pole.  
那人还未转身面对他，而是继续盯着那根杆子。

Looking at the landscape, the pilot of EVA Unit-01 took a deep breath of the clean air and closed his eyes.  
望着眼前的景色，EVA 初号机的驾驶员深吸了一口清新的空气，闭上了眼睛。

"I didn't come here to look at a meaningless pole."  
“我来这里不是为了看一根毫无意义的柱子。”

Again, Gendo did nothing for a moment, before speaking up "People let their memories fade in order to move on, although there are some things we must never forget."  
又一次，源堂沉默片刻，才开口道：“人们为了继续前行，会让记忆逐渐淡去，尽管有些事情我们绝不能遗忘。”

"Yui taught me that lesson, and I come here to remind myself of how much they matter."  
"结衣教会了我这个道理，我来这里是为了提醒自己他们有多重要。"

The boy rolled his eyes, wishing the man could see him, those same meaningless lines, how many times did he have to be subjected to them.  
男孩翻了个白眼，希望那人能看到他，那些同样的无意义话语，他得忍受多少次。

"Spare me, I'm not the one who threw away everything she cared about."  
"饶了我吧，我不是那个抛弃了所有她在乎的东西的人。"

The breeze blew between them, ruffling their loose clothing, there was more than just pictures in that statement.  
微风在他们之间吹过，轻轻拂动着他们宽松的衣衫，那句话中蕴含的不仅仅是画面。

"_You_ ran away three years ago, do you remember?"  
“你三年前逃走了，还记得吗？”

God that memory was so old, it was like a faded and cracked photograph, but that didn't matter, he remembered the feeling.  
那个记忆如此久远，宛如一张褪色且裂痕斑斑的照片，但那无关紧要，他记得那种感觉。

"No, all I remember is finding out if someone actually cared."  
"不，我只记得想知道是否有人真的在乎。"

Turning around Gendo eyed the boy's cold gaze, it was piercing, a vague memory of and argument with Yui crept into his mind's eye, overlaid on those brown eyes.  
转过身，源渡凝视着少年冰冷的目光，那眼神锐利如刀，一段与唯争吵的模糊记忆悄然浮现脑海，与那双棕色眼眸重叠。

"Enjoy the meaningless pole."  
"享受这无意义的柱子吧。"

The boy turned to leave, not caring what the man said, not wanting to hear anything else from him.  
男孩转身离去，不在乎那男人说什么，不想再听他任何话。

"Everything I need is inside my heart."  
“我所需要的一切，都在我心中。”

Shinji stopped, his fist clenched, his teeth grinding. A thousand retorts wanted to roll off his tongue, but he forced them down. How did this man always get the better of him, how did he make his blood boil like no one else could in every life?  
真嗣停下脚步，拳头紧握，牙齿咬得咯咯作响。无数反驳的话语涌上舌尖，却被他硬生生压下。为何这人总能占上风，为何他总能让自己怒火中烧，无人能及，无论在哪一生？

Taking a deep breath, the boy just turned his head, spat at the ground, and headed back to Misato's car.  
深吸一口气，少年只是转过头，朝地上吐了口唾沫，便返回美里小姐的车旁。

The only sound was the whine from Gendo's transport in his ear and the crunching of soil under his feet.  
唯一的声音是元渡的运输机在耳边的嗡鸣，以及脚下土壤的嘎吱声。

ʡʘʢ

"Stop the car!" “停车！”

They had been screaming along the mountainside when he saw it. The boy had only been half-listening to Misato's words about how good the visit had been for the two Ikari's.  
当他们沿着山腰疾驰时，他看到了那个男孩。他只听了一半美里关于这次拜访对两位碇氏有多好的话。

That's when he saw it.  
就在那时，他看到了它。

Throwing off the seatbelt that probably had just saved him from going into the windshield he opened the door and practically ran to the other side of the road with complete disregard for possible traffic.  
他甩开那条可能刚救了他一命的安全带，推开车门，几乎不顾一切地冲到马路对面，完全无视了可能来往的车辆。

Staring up at the mountainside he knew this wasn't his imagination, as soon as he had seen the white lines etched into the red hillside, he knew.  
他凝视着山坡，知道这绝非幻觉，一看到那红色山坡上刻着的白色线条，他就明白了。

Images of that beach had snapped right into his mind's eye.  
那片海滩的景象瞬间清晰地浮现在他的脑海中。

Spread out on the mountainside, clear of ruined buildings probably left over from the Second Impact, the outlines of a slim figure seemed etched into the ground.  
散布在山腰上，远离了可能源自第二次冲击的废墟建筑，一个纤细身影的轮廓仿佛被刻画在地面上。

Behind him he could hear Misato's door open, shouting at him to wait, but before she could run after the boy her earpiece had rung. He didn't much care, not when his mind raced with images of that beach.  
在他身后，他能听到美里打开门，大声喊他等一下，但还没等她追上来，她的耳机已经响了。他并不在意，因为他的脑海中正飞速闪现着那片海滩的画面。

Images of the production EVAs sticking out of the ground, arms outstretched as they stood in the red sea.  
生产型 EVA 插在地上的影像，它们张开双臂，矗立在红色的海洋中。

What was this? 这是什么？

Nothing even close to this had occurred before, nothing….  
从未发生过类似的事情，从未……

"SHINJI!" she yelled at him, getting back in the driver's seat.  
“真嗣！”她朝他喊道，重新坐回驾驶座。

He forced himself to turn, breaking free of the spell the image had put on him. Making eye contact with the woman, he instantly knew that look on her face.  
他强迫自己转身，挣脱了那幅画面施加在他身上的魔咒。与那女子目光相接的瞬间，他立刻明白了她脸上的神情。

"It's the Seventh Angel, we need to get back to HQ now!"  
“这是第七天使，我们得立刻返回总部！”

The boy blinked, this wasn't right, after Ramiel…  
男孩眨了眨眼，这不对劲，在拉米埃尔之后……

He ran back to the car, practically diving into the passenger seat as the Alpine A310 screeched away from where they had stopped.  
他跑回车里，几乎是扑进了副驾驶座，阿尔派 A310 随即尖啸着驶离了他们停下的地方。

This world had just got a lot more interesting.  
这个世界突然变得有趣多了。

**A nice long chapter for you guys today. They most likely wont be this long in the future, I just decided to merge two shorter chapters into this larger one. I actually prefer this since it's the just one chapter for the time-frame between 1.0 and 2.0.  
今天给你们来个长篇大作chapter。未来可能不会再有这么长的了，我只是决定把两个较短的章节合并成这一篇较长的。我其实更喜欢这样，因为它涵盖了 1.0 到 2.0 之间的时间框架，只有一个chapter。**

**SHOUTOUTS! 致敬！**

**Rowboat Girlyman 1- Same here, thanks!  
Rowboat Girlyman 1- 我也是，谢谢！**

**dyinglittelstar- Glad you liked it.  
dyinglittelstar- 很高兴你喜欢。**

**Alright, I think we all know what's about to happen, so buckle your seat belts.  
好了，我想我们都知道即将发生什么，所以系好安全带吧。**

**Until Next Time 下次见**

### Chapter 8: "We met as soulmates, on Parris Island..."  
Chapter 8: “我们在帕里斯岛作为灵魂伴侣相遇……”

Typically, it was a _very_ interesting day when the front turret of a Takanami-class destroyer lands in front of you, but today it only made the third on a list of strangest things to happen so far.  
通常情况下，一艘高波级驱逐舰的前炮塔落在你面前会是非常有趣的一天，但今天这只能排在迄今为止发生的第三件最奇怪的事情上。

And the day wasn't even over yet.  
而这一天甚至还没结束。

Shinji held on for dear life and mentally thanked Kaji for teaching Misato her suicidal driving tendencies as they swerved up a retaining wall to avoid the warship's turret.  
真嗣紧紧抓住车内的把手，心中暗自感谢加持教给美里那些自杀式的驾驶技巧，他们急转弯上了一堵挡墙，以避开战舰的炮塔。

As he was pushed back into his seat from the acceleration of the A310, the boy couldn't help but allow the ends of his lips to curl. Misato expertly drifted around the ramp leading down onto the freeway, Shinji was couldn't remember the last time he'd _really_ been privy to the limit of his guardian's driving skills.  
随着 A310 的加速，他被推回到座位上，男孩忍不住让嘴角微微上扬。美里熟练地在通往高速公路的斜坡上漂移，真嗣已经记不清上次真正见识到他监护人驾驶技术极限是什么时候了。

"I've got a clear visual on it!" Misato shouted into the small com piece pinned to her, "I'm bringing in the Unit-01 pilot right now!"  
"我已经清楚地看到了它！" 美里对着固定在身上的小型通讯器喊道，"我现在就带初号机驾驶员过去！"

If Shinji had been asked to describe an Angel, the thing walking across the red water was the last thing he would have thought of.  
如果真嗣被问及天使是什么样子，那么眼前这个在红色水面上行走的东西绝对是他最后会想到的。

Wait… red water? 等等……红色的水？

Well it wasn't like Tokyo-3 was on the ocean and this wasn't the route Misato had taken to his mother's 'grave'. He made a mental note about it for later, just another thing about this day to ponder.  
毕竟东京-3 并不临海，这条路也不是美里带他去他母亲‘墓地’的那条。他暗自记下这一点，留待日后细细思索，这不过是今天众多待解之谜中的又一桩。

This towering Angel seemed to freeze the water as its' two legs walked along. More interesting however, was the fact that it seemed to be constructed pf separate sections which worked together appearing like a normal organic creature, but there was nothing connecting them.  
这只高耸入云的使徒似乎能冻结水面，当它用两条腿行走时。然而，更有趣的是，它似乎是由多个独立部分组成，这些部分协同工作，看起来像一个正常的生物有机体，但实际上它们之间没有任何连接。

He reasoned it might be an AT field holding it together, it only made sense. Where was the core though? His eyes had a hard time making out anything other than the 'pendulum' that hung between the two legs which looked to him like a massive red sphere.  
他推测可能是 AT 力场将它们维系在一起，这合乎逻辑。但核心在哪里呢？他的眼睛很难分辨出除了悬挂在两腿之间的那个巨大红色球体之外的任何东西，那东西在他看来就像一个巨大的红色球体。

As they reached the bottom of the ramp, Shinji watched as Misato slammed the shifter into the next highest gear. The engine roared in delight as if it were enjoying being redlined for the first time in a long while and he felt himself again pushed back into his seat due to the acceleration.  
当他们到达坡道底部时，真嗣看着美里将换挡杆猛地推到更高一档。引擎发出欢快的轰鸣，仿佛久违地享受着极限运转的快感，而他再次因加速感被推回座椅。

"Implement Task Zero Three and prep Unit-00 for launch!"  
“执行任务零三，准备发射零号机！”

Instead of her earpiece the voice from HQ came through a piece mounted in the car for the both of them to hear. "Negative Task Zero Two has been Initiated."  
总部的声音并非通过她的耳机，而是从车内安装的扬声器传来，让两人都能听到：“任务零二已取消，启动替代方案。”

"Task Zero Two?" Misato asked confused, before her eyes shot up to the sky, "You mean…!?"  
“零二号任务？”美里困惑地问道，随即她的目光猛地投向天空，“你是说…！？”

Shinji didn't get to hear the last of that sentence as he followed her eyes to the sky. Above them she could see the silhouette of the massive flying-wing aircraft and the trails left by its' escorts.  
真嗣没能听到那句话的结尾，因为他随着她的目光望向天空。在他们上方，他可以看到那架巨大的飞翼式飞机的轮廓以及其护航机留下的尾迹。

A few small flashes later and some object was released from the flying-wing. Silhouetted against the sun, he watched as it shed pieces and spread its' arms, clearly showing that it was an Evangelion.  
几道微弱的闪光过后，某个物体从飞翼上被释放出来。在阳光的映衬下，他看着它脱落碎片并展开双臂，清晰地显示出那是一台 EVA。

"They launched Unit-02!" he heard Misato call as she stuck her head out the window.  
"他们启动了二号机！" 他听到美里从窗户探出头来喊道。

Doing the same, he squinted and could clearly see the extra wings of the S-Type equipment. He felt a bit jealous of the Second Children, of all combat equipment, he had to admit that getting to essentially paradrop in an EVA was by far the most fun.  
他也跟着望出去，眯起眼睛，清楚地看到了 S 型装备的额外机翼。他对二号机的驾驶员有些羡慕，在所有战斗装备中，他不得不承认，能够像空降一样进入 EVA，绝对是迄今为止最有趣的体验。

A stab of worry shot through him as black strings shot up towards the Evangelion and he held his breath as the crimson EVA dodged and weaved in an aerobatic display that would put even the best fighter pilots to shame.  
当黑色的线条射向 EVA 时，他心中涌起一阵担忧，屏住呼吸，看着那台红色 EVA 以令人眼花缭乱的空中机动躲避，其灵活程度足以让最顶尖的战斗机飞行员都自愧不如。

It looked like Unit-02 grabbed something and seeing the explosion on the Seventh Angel's highest part, Shinji guessed it was some kind of rifle.  
看起来 02 号机抓住了什么东西，看到第七使徒最高部分发生的爆炸，真嗣猜测那可能是一种步枪。

He smiled at the display of skill as the Angel's structure began to fall apart, Misato shouted something. If it was for him to hear he didn't know, the wind howling as they blazed down the highway kept him from hearing anything.  
他对使徒结构开始崩解的技能展示微微一笑，美里大喊着什么。他不知道这是否是喊给他听的，因为疾风呼啸，他们在高速公路上疾驰，让他什么也听不见。

The falling pieces suddenly stopped and fascinatingly that red sphere swung so that I was now on top of the two reforming 'legs'.  
坠落的碎片突然停止了，令人着迷的是，那个红色球体摆动着，使得我现在位于正在重组的‘双腿’之上。

As Unit-02 fell closer, Shinji could now clearly make out the EVA had some sort of rifle as it let out a string of bolts towards the Angel with such accuracy that they stacked on top of each other when they hit the AT field.  
随着 02 号机愈发逼近，真嗣现在能清晰地看到 EVA 手持某种步枪，它向使徒射出一连串子弹，其精准度之高，以至于击中 AT 力场时，弹痕竟层层叠叠地堆叠在一起。

Discarding the rifle, Unit-02 spun to get its' foot out in front. Letting its heel dig into the first bolt, the AT field flashed as slowly the top bolt split the ones beneath it over and over again, until it struggled against the force of the AT field.  
丢开步枪，二号机转身将脚向前伸出。让脚跟嵌入第一颗螺栓，随着 AT 力场的闪烁，顶部的螺栓缓缓将下方的螺栓逐一劈开，直至它与 AT 力场的力量抗衡。

For a moment noting happened, Unit-02 just balanced there, the bolt digging itself into the AT field.  
一时间什么也没发生，二号机只是稳稳地悬在那里，那根长矛深深嵌入了 AT 力场。

Then it gave way. 随后，它突破了。

Unit-02 plowed its way into that massive red sphere, Shinji's heart skipped a beat at the thought of her stuck inside it, like he had been trapped inside Leliel. But those fears were never realized.  
二号机奋力冲入那巨大的红色球体，真嗣的心跳漏了一拍，担心她会像自己被困在雷里尔内部那样被困住。但这些担忧最终并未成真。

The main sphere burst like a grape. Out the other side, the Angel's core had been firmly was pierced by the last bolt which still was still on the heel of Unit-02.  
主球体爆裂如葡萄。穿过另一侧，天使的核心已被最后一枚螺栓牢牢贯穿，这枚螺栓仍紧贴在二号机的脚跟上。

Letting out that breath he had been holding Shinji collapsed back in his seat as the flash from the destruction of the angels core lit up the A310.  
随着天使核心毁灭的闪光照亮 A310，真嗣终于呼出那口憋着的气，瘫坐在座位上。

Racing towards the NERV entrance, they watched from a distance as the rockets in the S-Type equipment fired, slowing the Evangelion down for a 'softer' landing.  
他们疾驰向 NERV 入口，远远望见 S 型装备中的火箭发射，减缓了福音战士的下降速度，以实现更“柔和”的着陆。

Shinji silently thanked his pervious outburst as they drove into the parking lot, or what was left of it. Most of the asphalt would have to be repaved. A small drop in NERV's budget though.  
真嗣默默感谢自己之前的爆发，当他们驶入停车场，或者说剩下的那部分时。大部分的沥青都得重新铺设。不过这对 NERV 的预算来说只是个小数目。

If they had made it there 5 minutes faster, he was sure they'd both be nursing headaches and Misato would be shedding tears over the state of her car.  
如果他们能早到五分钟，他确信他们俩都会头疼，而美里则会为她的车子的状况掉眼泪。

ʡʘʘʢ

As the Third Children watched the thousands of tons worth of armor plating creep in front of him, he felt a sense of dread in his stomach.  
当第三适格者目睹着数千吨重的装甲板缓缓逼近时，他心中涌起了一股恐惧。

This was wrong. 这不对劲。

It wasn't like he wasn't used to this, after all he'd lived lives where Evangelions as a whole didn't exist.  
毕竟，他并非不习惯这些，毕竟他经历过没有 EVA 存在的世界。

But… he couldn't describe it, this world felt as if it was supposed to be following his original life, but somehow, something, ended up one degree off. Shifting everything just enough.  
但……他无法描述这种感觉，这个世界仿佛本应沿着他原本的生活轨迹前行，但不知为何，某些事物偏离了一度，足以改变一切。

First the date of his mother's death, those white outlines mirroring the fate of the original production EVAs, the red ocean, and now this…  
先是母亲去世的日期，那些与原版 EVA 命运相似的白色轮廓，红色的海洋，还有现在这个……

He would be lying if he didn't want the opportunity to meet a certain redhead on _Over The Rainbow_ again. Not only would he be more familair, but he'd also be able to make a good first impression in Unit-02, maybe even nudge the Second Children in the direction of discovering her mother's soul inside.  
如果说他不想再次在《彩虹之上》遇见某位红发女孩，那他就是在撒谎。不仅他会更加熟悉，而且还能在二号机中留下良好的第一印象，甚至可能引导二号适格者发现她母亲灵魂的所在。

Now… 现在…

"Wow its cool Unit-02 is red!" Kensuke roared, breaking him from his thoughts.  
“哇，二号机是红色的，真酷！” 真嗣被剑介的吼声从思绪中拉了回来。

Shinji had piloted EVA's of every color, construction, state of repair, and dubiousness you could think of and he had never seen connection between the color and combat effectiveness.  
真嗣驾驶过各种颜色、构造、维修状态和可疑程度的 EVA，但他从未发现颜色与战斗效能之间有何关联。

How the stooges had been given access to this area was beyond him, but here they were, along with Rei who was standing a bit separated from the group saying nothing.  
那些小丑是如何进入这片区域的，他不得而知，但他们确实在这里，还有丽，她站在稍远的地方，一言不发。

_Even further back she was leaning against the chain-link fence, that one eye glaring at him and saying more than words ever could.  
她更靠后一些，倚着铁丝网，那只眼睛怒视着他，无声胜有声。_

Right now, it wasn't the color of Unit-02 that was on Shinji's mind, it was the pilot…  
此刻，让真嗣心烦意乱的并非二号机的颜色，而是那位驾驶员……

"That's not that only thing that's cool about it!" A female voice boomed; there she was.  
“这可不是它唯一的酷炫之处！”一个女声洪亮地响起；她就在那里。

He looked up to finally see her, standing on top of her beloved Evangelion, the redhead herself was silhouetted against the sky in her red plug suit.  
他抬头终于看到了她，站在她心爱的福音战士顶上，红发女郎身着红色插入栓服，剪影映衬着天空。

How many times had he seen her like this, a champion, the returning conquering hero, and it never ceased to amaze him, he was left gawking like the others there only this wasn't his first time.  
他见过她多少次这样，一位冠军，凯旋的英雄，每一次都让他惊叹不已，他像其他人一样目瞪口呆，但这已不是他第一次见到这样的场景。

"Unit-00 and Unit-01 are nothing but beta testing prototypes, they're antiquated machinery," That's a classic, insulting the other EVAs.  
“零号机和初号机不过是测试原型，都是些过时的机器。”这简直是经典，在贬低其他 EVA。

"but Unit-02 is the final product, it's the world's very first Evangelion, perfect in every way."  
但零二号机是最终成品，它是世界上第一台福音战士，完美无缺。

Ah, that arrogance never did get old.  
啊，那份傲慢从未过时。

For a brief moment Shinji could smell salty sea air, and an image of the redhead in a tan sun dress superimposed itself over the one he was watching, it felt like poetry, rhyming with his own first life.  
有那么一瞬，真嗣闻到了咸咸的海风，一位红发女孩穿着棕褐色太阳裙的影像叠映在他眼前的人身上，宛如诗句，与他前世的生活韵律相合。

But that was a _long_ time ago.  
但那是很久以前的事了。

"And there she is" Minato Started "the pride of the Euro Air Force Captain Asuka Langley Shikinami, she's the second child, and the designated pilot of Unit-02."  
“她来了。” 南斗开始介绍，“欧洲空军之骄傲，明日香·兰格雷·椎名，她是第二适格者，也是二号机的指定驾驶员。”

_Captain… 队长……_

_Shikinami… 式波…_

_That name rang in his head over and over, seemingly trying to smash reality to peices.  
那个名字在他脑海中一遍遍回响，仿佛试图将现实击得粉碎。_

Not _Soryu._ 不是惣流。

"_Have fun with the fake baka, humph." She called out._  
"和那个假笨蛋玩得开心点，哼。" 她喊道。

Shinji just ignored the jab and watched the redhead gracefully jump down the side of her EVA, her movements perfect, no hesitation, his mind worked itself into a frenzy trying to comprehend that simple little change…  
真嗣只是无视了她的嘲讽，注视着红发女孩优雅地从她的 EVA 侧面跳下，动作完美无瑕，毫无犹豫，他的思绪陷入了一阵狂乱，试图理解那微小的变化……

It was only her name and she didn't appear any different, maybe her hair might be a slightly different color… no he was sure it was a shade different thought she could still be called a redhead and her complexion hadn't changed.  
仅仅是她的名字，她看起来并没有什么不同，也许她的发色可能稍有变化……不，他确信那是一种不同的色调，尽管她仍可被称为红发，而她的肤色并未改变。

Beautiful still wasn't a good enough word for her, angelic might fit it, how unfortunate that word had to be connected to other things.  
美丽这个词仍不足以形容她，天使般的或许更贴切，可惜这个词总让人联想到其他事物，真是遗憾。

And her attitude certainly hadn't changed either.  
而她的态度显然也没有丝毫改变。

She strode towards them with confidence, and…  
她自信地向他们走来，而且……

"Shinji are you alright?" Toji asked, "You're looking a bit… pale?"  
"真嗣，你还好吗？" 冬二问道，"你看起来有点……苍白？"

He felt an elbow his ribs, "New girl taking your breath away, hmm?" he said with a smirk.  
他感觉肋骨被肘部顶了一下，"新来的女孩让你神魂颠倒了吧，嗯？" 他带着一丝戏谑说道。

"It's been a while Misato," She said with a kind of charm in her voice, before glaring at the leaving figure of Rei.  
"好久不见，美里，" 她用一种迷人的语调说道，随后目光锐利地盯着离去的绫波的身影。

The duality of the Second Children was on display for everyone for the first time. Everyone except him.  
第二适格者的双重性首次展现在所有人面前。除了他之外。

"So that's the Unit-00 pilot, the teacher's pet herself?" she said with a bit of venom in her voice.  
“原来她就是零号机的驾驶员，老师的宠儿啊？”她带着几分尖酸的语气说道。

Turning to the three boys next to the violet-haired adult, her eyes seemingly scanned them like a predator judging if it wants its' prey.  
转向那位紫发成年人旁边的三个男孩，她的目光仿佛掠食者在评估是否要捕食猎物一般扫视着他们。

"And one of you must be the daddy's boy who lucked himself into the Unit-01's cockpit?" She asked, her annoyance seemingly being put on the jock of first, then the one with glasses shifted nervously, cracking under the weight of her gaze.  
"那么，你们中一定有个是那位幸运儿，坐进了 01 号机的驾驶舱吧？" 她问道，不满的情绪似乎首先针对了那位运动员，然后是那个戴着眼镜、在她目光下紧张不安地挪动的人。

And him... 还有他...

"Guten Morgan" "早上好"

Everyone seemed to freeze, even Misato. Eyes widened, or narrowed in confusion, they all looked at Shinji who didn't bat an eye.  
每个人都仿佛凝固了，就连美里也不例外。他们的眼睛或是瞪大，或是困惑地眯起，全都注视着真嗣，而他却丝毫不为所动。

"**[Impressive display of skill with the Angel.]"** He spoke in her native tongue.  
“[对使徒展现出的惊人技艺。]”他用她的母语说道。

She blinked, like a duck being hit on the head. He was willing to bet she read his file before coming here and the fact he was speaking to her in German threw her off.  
她眨了眨眼，就像被击中脑袋的鸭子一样。他敢打赌，她在来之前一定读过他的档案，而他用德语与她交谈的事实让她措手不及。

To the Second Children's credit she recomposed herself before anyone else could realize how offput she was **"[So it looks like someone has a bit of culture here after all...]"**  
好在二小姐及时调整了情绪，没等旁人察觉她的不悦，便开口道：“[看来这里终究还是有那么点儿文化气息的嘛……]”

"**[But, were you too busy to help me out, not that I needed it!]"** She said angerly in German, not that it was hard to sound angry when speaking it.  
"[但是，你是不是太忙了没空帮我，虽然我也不需要！]" 她用德语生气地说道，用这种语言表达愤怒并不难。

It was almost like a whole language was suited to the girl.  
这几乎就像整个语言都是为这个女孩量身定做的。

Despite having to pause a split second to translate the language in his head, Shinji could still see her foot coming to sweep him a few moments before it would have hit, it was after all a classic thing for her to do.  
尽管需要暂停一瞬间在脑海中翻译语言，真嗣仍然能提前几秒钟看到她的脚即将扫过来，毕竟这是她的经典动作。

She always tried to knock him off his feet when they first met, at least that hadn't changed.  
她总是一见面就想让他措手不及，至少这一点没变。

So, he responded in kind.  
于是，他也以同样的方式回应。

But faster. 但更快。

He had plenty of lifetimes to practice beating her at her own game.  
他有无数次生命来练习在她的游戏中击败她。

Once again, she looked confused, like no one had ever gotten the best of her, at this point he was sure that hadn't happened yet.  
她再次显得困惑，仿佛从未有人在这件事上胜过她，此时他确信这还未发生过。

And it was likely that no one had saved her from something yet either.  
很可能也还没有人从某种困境中救过她。

So, there they were, with his hand grasping her forearm, keeping her from just barely hitting the concrete.  
就这样，他的手紧抓着她的前臂，使她免于重重摔在混凝土上。

Her eyes bore into his, and for the first time in her life, the girl had the feeling that she would not be winning this fight.  
她的目光直射入他的眼底，这一生中，女孩第一次感觉到这场战斗她赢不了。

He on the other hand could practically feel the red magma around them and, for a moment at least, he was back in that volcano holding onto her at the end of a line again.  
而他则几乎能感受到周围炽热的岩浆，至少在这一刻，他仿佛又回到了那座火山中，再次在绳索尽头紧握着她。

He pulled her back up to a steady standing position, now on firm feet he lowered his hand from her forearm to her hand.  
他将她拉回稳定的站立姿势，现在双脚稳稳地站在地上，他把手从她的前臂移到她的手上。

"**[I was visiting someone; Misato was driving me.]"** he explained casually, like nothing had just happened between them.  
"[我去看望某人；美里开车送我。]" 他随意地解释道，仿佛他们之间刚刚什么都没发生过。

For a second time the German blinked.  
德国人再次眨了眨眼。

"**[There's more to life than piloting, wouldn't you say?]"** he asked, his face betraying him with a friendly smile.  
"[生活中不仅仅只有驾驶，你说呢？]" 他问道，脸上带着友好的微笑，泄露了他的真实情感。

It was a good push in the right direction.  
这是一个正确的推动方向。

Asuka was still a bit weirded out by the encounter. Like she needed him to keep her from falling on the ground. He must have stopped her because he thought it would hurt him, what a wimp.  
对于这次遭遇，明日香还是感到有些不自在。好像她需要他来防止自己摔倒似的。他一定是觉得她摔倒会连累到他，真是个胆小鬼。

At the same time, the faintest part of her knew that logic was all just for her own pride.  
与此同时，她内心最微弱的一部分明白，逻辑不过是为了维护她自己的自尊。

He shook her hand "It's nice to meet you Asuka S…_Shikinami_" the smile still on his face "You won't get me to call you Captain though."  
他握住她的手，“很高兴见到你，明日香·S…·式波。”他脸上依然挂着微笑，“不过，我可不会叫你舰长。”

A slap was all he received, it was painful, but it was from her so of course it hurt more, that was expected, even with their hands still shaking he touched his reddening cheek, the smile still on his face.  
他只得到了一记耳光，虽然疼痛，但因为是她打的，自然更痛，这是预料之中的事。即便他们的手还在颤抖，他仍抚摸着发红的脸颊，脸上依旧带着笑容。

"Roter Drache" 红龙

ʡʘʘʢ

The blonde pressed another lipstick-stained cigarette out into the rapidly growing pile on her ashtray and took a sip of coffee.  
金发女子将另一支沾有口红的香烟按进烟灰缸中，那里的烟蒂已堆积如山，随后她啜了一口咖啡。

Putting down the Third Child's file she leaned back into her chair, her theories were just that, theories. She had made no progress in explaining what happened weeks ago with the Third Child and every time she brought the topic up with the commander, he dismissed her, as he called it, obsession with the subject.  
放下第三适格者的档案，她向后靠在椅背上，她的那些理论仅仅是理论而已。她未能对几周前第三适格者发生的事情做出任何解释，每次她向指挥官提起这个话题，他都以所谓的“对这事的执念”为由将她打发。

It was as if the blonde was the only person at NERV who thought bringing back a person from the dead was a big deal!  
仿佛在 NERV 里，只有那个金发女孩认为让死者复生是一件大事！

Ritsuko closed her eyes, her mind switched gears to the checklist of tests that would needed after Unit-02's arrival.  
律子闭上眼睛，脑海中迅速切换到 Unit-02 抵达后所需的测试清单。

The Second Child would need a baseline sync test shortly after her arrival, which meant rolling it into a sync test will all three children.  
第二适任者抵达后不久需要进行基准同步测试，这意味着需要将其纳入与三位适任者共同进行的同步测试中。

It wasn't the Second Child she was worried about; it was the Third. He hadn't been put in an entry plug since the Sixth Angel, mostly because of her keeping it that way.  
她担心的不是二号机，而是三号机。自从第六使徒之后，他就没有再进入插入栓，这主要是因为她一直维持着这种状态。

Not that she could keep it from happening any longer.  
不是说她还能阻止它发生。

The scientist was pulled from her thoughts as a set of arms wrapped around her shoulders from behind. A fleeting sense of panic went through her before a familiar voice found its' way into her ear.  
科学家从沉思中被拉回现实，一双手臂从背后环抱住她的肩膀。她心中掠过一丝慌乱，直到一个熟悉的声音钻入她的耳中。

"You lost a little weight eh Ritsuko?" ah this old flirt.  
“理津子，你是不是瘦了点？”哎呀，这个老调情高手。

She knew that voice anywhere.  
她无论在哪里都能认出这个声音。

"Nice try, but I've gained more than I like to admit." She had already forgotten about her worries of the Third Child, her old friend seemingly washing them away.  
"不错的尝试，但我得到的比我愿意承认的更多。" 她已经忘记了关于第三子的忧虑，她的老朋友似乎将它们一扫而空。

"Maybe you're just wearing too many clothes." He said, caressing her face playfully.  
"也许你只是穿得太多了。" 他打趣地说，轻抚她的脸颊。

"I'd show you, but this room is being monitored." She retorted with a smile.  
"我本想展示给你看，但这个房间被监控着。" 她笑着反驳道。

"I replaced the main feed with a loop." He countered.  
“我将主进料口换成了循环模式。”他反驳道。

"You're prepared as always hmm?" He was, but from what she could see, the man needed to shave, and he needed to visit a decent barber. Sloppy as ever when it came to his appearance apparently.  
“你一如既往地准备好了，嗯？”他确实准备好了，但从她能看到的来说，这位男士需要刮胡子，还得去趟像样的理发店。在个人形象上，显然还是那么邋遢。

"Hey when I play, I play to win."  
"嘿，我玩的时候，就是为了赢。"

"But you lost." She said, eying the window, and the violet haired demon that was pressed against the glass, her breath fogging it.  
"但你输了。" 她边说边瞥向窗户，一个紫发恶魔紧贴在玻璃上，她的呼吸在上面凝成雾气。

"Should've covered the windows too."  
"本该把窗户也遮住的。"

Misato's blood was boiling at the site of the man.  
看到那个男人，美里气得血脉贲张。

He mumbled something to Ritsuko, just as she walked through the door, which only caused her blood to boil more.  
他对着刚进门的美里咕哝了几句，结果让她更加怒火中烧。

"What the hell is this jerk doing here, I thought you got assigned to Europe?"  
“这个混蛋在这里干什么？我以为你被派到欧洲去了？”

"I'm on a job, looks like I'll be here awhile, so the three of us can hang out, it'll be just like old times." Kaji said as he leaned against Ritsuko's desk.  
"我正在执行任务，看来要在这里待上一阵子，我们三个可以聚聚，就像过去那样。" 加持说着，靠在了律子的办公桌上。

"Who the hell wants to relive the past, and I'm down here to see Ritsuko not you. HR has just given us the approval on Asuka."  
"谁他妈想重温旧梦啊，我是下来见律子的，不是你。人事部刚批准了明日香的事。"

She stood there, looking at the two of them, him leaning against the desk she sat at, they both looked at her, imploring her to go on.  
她站在那里，看着他们俩，他倚在她的办公桌上，两人都望着她，恳求她继续说下去。

"And?" Ritsuko asked, she knew there was more.  
"然后呢？" 律子问道，她知道还有下文。

Misato started, but hesitated, she knew this was going to be strange, even coming from her, but she had to tell her, the fact that Kaji was there didn't matter.  
美里开始讲述，但又犹豫了，她知道这听起来会很奇怪，即便对她自己来说也是如此，但她必须告诉律子，即使加持在场也无所谓。

"Did you know Shinji speaks German?" she asked quietly, her anger suddenly evaporated now at the thought of the boy.  
"你知道真嗣会说德语吗？" 她轻声问道，一想到那个男孩，她的怒气突然间烟消云散了。

Ritsuko raised an eyebrow, "Shinji doesn't know German," her face settled in a devilish look "did someone tip him off on the nationality of our new pilot."  
律子挑了挑眉，"真嗣不懂德语，"她的脸上露出一丝狡黠的神情，"是不是有人向他透露了我们新驾驶员的国籍。"

Kaji chuckled, shrugging in agreement "I've known boys who've done less to try to impress a beautiful new girl, including myself actually."  
加持轻笑一声，耸肩表示同意，"我认识一些男孩，为了给漂亮的新女孩留下印象，做得比这还少，包括我自己其实也是。"

Misato's eyes narrowed "He's fluent."  
美里眯起了眼睛，"他很流利。"

Her friend's eyebrow raised behind her glasses "You're joking."  
她朋友透过眼镜挑起眉毛，“你在开玩笑吧。”

"NO!" She exclaimed throwing her hands up "He greeted her in German, listen to her in German, I think he threatened her in German, even seemed to spar with her in German, he only welcomed her to the team in Japanese, there wasn't even a pause, I wouldn't have known it was his second language!"  
“不！”她大喊着举起双手，“他用德语跟她打招呼，用德语听她说话，我觉得他甚至用德语威胁她，还用德语和她比试，他只在欢迎她加入团队时用了日语，连停顿都没有，我根本不知道那是他的第二语言！”

Kaji just stared at her friend, who's mind seemed to be fried by the idea that someone could speak two languages.  
加治只是盯着她的朋友，似乎这个想法让她的脑子都烧坏了，竟然有人能说两种语言。

"It's not a big deal Misato, lots of people know a second language."  
“这没什么大不了的，美里，很多人都会第二语言。”

"Yeah, but how many know German here in Japan, and how many have a new pilot coming from German?" Kaji mused.  
“是啊，但在日本这里有多少人懂德语，又有多少人会迎来一位来自德国的新飞行员呢？”加持沉思道。

How many of those came back to life?  
有多少人复活了？

"You shut up!" Misato yelled while pointing at him "This has nothing to do with you."  
“你闭嘴！”美里指着他大喊，“这跟你无关。”

Before she stormed off, leaving the both of them in a very perplexing situation.  
在她怒气冲冲地离开之前，留下他们俩陷入了一个非常困惑的境地。

So, like I said with the Netflix dub being my go-to for the original series, I'm defaulting to that.**  
好了，2.0 版本来了。快速说明一下，我将使用 Soryu 这个拼写。我在网上见过 Sohryu 的拼法，在《新世纪福音战士》提案书中是 Sōryō，而在 Netflix 字幕中则是 Soryu。所以，就像我之前提到的，Netflix 的配音版是我首选的原系列版本，我默认采用那个拼写。

**SHOUTOUTS! 特别鸣谢！**

**KySocceRref- Yeah, I love a good time travel story, I started to think about a straight NGE-only story, but I didn't see very many Rebuild stories. Then first time I watched them I noticed the details that are pointed out in the Loop Theory and** _**that**_ **is what got me here.**  
KySocceRref——是的，我喜欢好的时间旅行故事，我开始考虑一个纯粹的《新世纪福音战士》故事，但我发现关于《福音战士新剧场版》的故事并不多。第一次观看时，我注意到了循环理论中指出的那些细节，这就是我来到这里的原因。

**kyinglittelstar- Always happy to brighten a mood! I actually kinda want to see the 'spoilers without context' meme pop up again for 3.0+1.0, the same way they happened with Avengers: Endgame. I have a feeling with Anno's writing it'd be even more confusing.  
kyinglittelstar- 总是乐于点亮心情！我其实有点想看到《3.0+1.0》再次出现那种“无上下文剧透”的梗，就像《复仇者联盟 4：终局之战》那样。我预感，以庵野的编剧风格，这会变得更加令人困惑。**

**Gleaming Onyx- Well there you go, lets just say the 'Ghost of Asukas past' is going to… well… I don't want to spoil anything, but don't worry, I'm gonna have a blast when the time comes.  
闪耀的黑曜石——好吧，这么说吧，可以称之为‘明日香过去的幽灵’即将……嗯……我不想剧透太多，但别担心，到时候我肯定会玩得很开心。**

**So, thoughts about waiting for 3.0+1.0, honestly, I could go two ways with this story. I can wait too… ***_**ahem**_*** "somehow" see it, albeit probably without subtitles, or I can just go on and default to NGE for details or I can wait 6-8 months. My dilemma really revolves around character details… like what is** _Shikinami's_ **backstory, we know** _Soryu's_**, but obviously they are** _**not**_ **the same character. Judging just by behavior alone they are not the same, I mean Shikinami has a doll! Soryu would never have a toy doll. It seems like her mother (I'll be the first to say she's the redhead with glasses in that picture in 3.0) probably had a similar fate, but something different happened? Of course I could just fill in those holes myself but that just doesn't feel right.**  
那么，关于等待 3.0+1.0 的想法，老实说，我对此有两种选择。我也可以等待……*咳咳* “不知怎么地”看到它，尽管可能没有字幕，或者我可以直接转向《新世纪福音战士》来获取细节，或者我可以等 6-8 个月。我的纠结主要围绕角色细节……比如，式波的背景故事是什么，我们知道惣流的故事，但显然她们不是同一个角色。仅从行为来看，她们就不一样，我是说，式波有个玩偶！惣流绝不会有玩具娃娃。看起来她的母亲（我会第一个说她是 3.0 中那个戴眼镜的红发女子）可能有着类似的命运，但发生了一些不同的事情？当然，我可以自己填补这些空白，但那样感觉就不对了。

**Do I really expect to get answers in 3.0+1.0? Not particularly, I'd bet it'll be just as off the wall as EOE (Or my own personal idea of it being a discount Endgame lol), but it'd be nice to have a bit more information.  
我真的期望在 3.0+1.0 中得到答案吗？并不特别期待，我敢打赌它也会像《真心为你》（或者我个人认为它是折扣版的《终局》lol）一样离奇，但能多一些信息总是好的。**

### Chapter 9: "…I don't know where to go from here..."  
Chapter 9: "…我不知道接下来该去哪儿……"

All in all, Toji and Kensuke reacted about as well as they had the first time the two of them met the fiery German. Now, Toji hadn't been slapped in the face, and there had been no indecent exchanges between the two, but the boy had just about the same opinion of her.  
总的来说，东治和真嗣对这位德国火辣女孩的反应与他们第一次见面时差不多。这次东治没有被扇耳光，两人之间也没有不雅的交流，但男孩对她的看法几乎没变。

In fact, the jock had clapped the Third Children on the back at the way he 'took that chick down a peg'. Shinji had simply frowned in response.  
实际上，那个运动员拍了拍‘第三适格者’的背，夸他‘把那女孩压了一头’。真嗣只是皱了皱眉作为回应。

"You only just met her, maybe give her a chance, like you did with me."  
“你才刚认识她，或许可以给她个机会，就像你对我那样。”

Toji had just shrugged at the suggestion, but it had been enough to dissuade the three of them from talking about the new pilot.  
对此，渡志只是耸了耸肩，但这已经足够让他们三人不再谈论新来的驾驶员。

Heading their separate ways, Shinji found his mind wandering back to the events of the day.  
各自离去时，真嗣的思绪却不由自主地飘回了当天发生的事情。

"_Oh look, you've already replaced me, how sad." She mocked, as she walked beside him. The red sunset only amplified the bloody bandages and tears in her red plugsuit._  
“哦，看吧，你已经把我替换了，真可悲。”她嘲讽道，走在他身旁。夕阳的红色只是放大了她红色驾驶服上的血迹绷带和泪痕。

_Soryu still looked beautiful to him though.  
但在他眼中，惣流依然美丽动人。_

She always played on that fear of his, so this was nothing new. At first, keeping himself from breaking down in front of every version of her and begging for forgiveness every time he met her had been hard enough. Keeping her from her downward spiral had been a distant dream then.  
她总是利用他这份恐惧，所以这并不新鲜。起初，每次面对她的不同版本时，克制自己不崩溃、不乞求原谅已经够难了。那时，阻止她走向自我毁灭的深渊只是一个遥不可及的梦。

Not that he survived long in those first lives to begin with.  
毕竟，他在那些最初的生命中本就活不了多久。

Then he had tried to keep her at arm's length, a bit too much like Misato lived if he had to be honest. Pleasant enough, but it was like a skipping across water, never going beyond a surface level.  
后来，他试图与她保持距离，有点像美里那样生活，如果他必须诚实的话。表面上还算愉快，但就像蜻蜓点水，从未深入过。

"_Then you screwed it all up didn't you, honestly there's no limit with you!"_  
"然后你把它全搞砸了，不是吗？说实话，你真是无底线！"

She was right just like always.  
她一如既往地正确。

Now he had a new variable to deal with.  
现在他有了一个新的变量要应对。

Shikinami… 式波…

Maybe here Asuka didn't need help. Maybe she was perfectly well adjusted, happy even, she just happened to have that same cocky attitude. He'd seen stranger things after all.  
或许在这里，明日香并不需要帮助。也许她完全适应得很好，甚至很快乐，只是恰好有着那种自信满满的态度。毕竟，他见过更奇怪的事情。

He'd probably be able to tell pretty soon.  
他大概很快就能看出来了。

"_Baka Shinji, always having to try and 'save' someone."_  
“笨蛋真嗣，总是想着要‘拯救’谁。”

"Will you be quiet?" he mumbled. No one was around, it wasn't as if the Section 2 personnel he was sure currently following him would think that he was mumbling to an invisible companion.  
"你能安静点吗？" 他咕哝道。四周无人，他确信第二区的那些人此刻正跟踪着他，但总不会以为他在对一个隐形伙伴嘀咕吧。

"_Hmph, I'm not the one who's been obsessed with 'saving' every redhead they meet."_  
"哼，我可不是那个一见到红发就想着'拯救'的人。"

"I made a promise, didn't I?"  
"我许下了承诺，不是吗？"

"_Not to me. What exactly did you to me again?" she asked, knowing the question would stab at him like nothing else._  
“对我来说不是。你到底又对我做了什么？”她问道，明知这个问题会像刀子一样刺痛他。

He had resigned himself to that guilt a long time ago, of all the regrets he carried, the things in his first life weighed on him the most.  
他早已接受了那份愧疚，在他所有的悔恨中，前世的事情对他影响最为深重。

_She smirked, her head held high and his drooped as they walked together. She always won this game; it was too easy.  
她得意地笑了，昂首挺胸，而他则垂头丧气地与她并肩走着。她总是赢得这场游戏；这太容易了。_

Shinji's mind floated back to the Angel he had seen today. It was completely new and that disturbed him. Probably one of the biggest reasons he could actually stay alive was knowing the Angels before they appeared.  
碇真嗣的思绪飘回到了今天所见的那位使徒身上。它完全陌生，这让他感到不安。或许他能活下来的最大原因之一，就是能在使徒出现前就了解它们。

Quickly and efficiently taking them down was something he had almost perfected to an art over his time and if new ones were to start emerging, well that was a mighty big wrench in his plans.  
迅速而高效地将它们击倒，在他多年的历练中几乎已臻化境，但如果新的敌人开始涌现，那可真是他计划中的巨大变数。

Plans? 计划？

No, he hadn't schemed and plotted since his whole predicament was still novel to him. The only thing he needed to do was stay alive and keep instrumentality from occurring, that was the endgame, stopping a Third Impact.  
不，自从他陷入这种困境以来，他还没有策划过什么。他唯一需要做的就是活下去，阻止人类补完计划的发生，那就是最终目标，阻止第三次冲击。

As much as he would try… Kaji, Toji, even Misato… if he was put in that position…  
尽管他会尽力……加治、冬治，甚至是美里……如果他处于那种境地……

His hand grabbed the familiar pendent under his shirt out of habit.  
他的手习惯性地抓住了藏在衬衫下的熟悉吊坠。

Well, he expected they'd all willingly trade their lives for preventing the Third Impact.  
嗯，他预料到他们会自愿牺牲生命来阻止第三次冲击。

Not that he wouldn't hate himself more for their deaths.  
并非说他不会因为他们的死而更加痛恨自己。

Next would be Israfel, it'd probably be a few days or weeks till it appeared. The thought of taking the loss to the Angel so that Asuka and him would undergo sync training again crossed his mind.  
接下来是伊斯拉斐尔，可能需要几天或几周时间才会出现。他脑海中闪过这样一个念头：为了能让明日香和他再次进行同步训练，他愿意承受对天使的损失。

Selfish? Yes, but would he be able to hide how much he could predict her movements? That was dependent on how different she was here. With so much experience being in sync with Soryu over countless lives and her (diplomatically put) _aggressive_ personality, he'd been more inclined to sync with her than her to him.  
自私吗？是的，但他能否隐藏自己对她的动作有多么准确的预判呢？这取决于她在这里有多大的不同。经历了无数次与惣流同步，以及她（委婉地说）好斗的性格，他更倾向于与她同步，而不是她倾向于与他同步。

"Roter Drache" he whispered to himself.  
“红龙”他低声自语道。

When had he given her that name, hadn't Toji called her Red Devil, or Demon? He couldn't remember, the two stooges probably had given her a name at some point.  
他何时给了她那个名字？不是东治叫她红魔或恶魔吗？他记不清了，那两个家伙可能在某一刻给她起了个名字。

It was fitting, she was as viscous as a dragon while also being something beautiful beyond reasoning. Hording her feelings to herself and incinerating anyone who dared come near, yet wanting everyone's eyes on her.  
这很贴切，她像龙一样凶猛，同时又美得超乎常理。将情感深藏心底，焚烧任何胆敢靠近的人，却又渴望众人的目光聚焦于她。

At least that was how Soryu had been.  
至少那是曾经的惣流。

By the time he had arrived at Misato's apartment the sun had sunk even lower into the horizon. Giving the glorious sunset one last look he made his way up the apartment block and to his home's door.  
当他抵达美里公寓时，太阳已经沉得更低了。他最后看了一眼壮丽的日落，便走向公寓楼，来到自己家的门前。

"_Already calling it home, now are we?"_  
“已经把它当家了，是吗？”

Opening the door, his eyes widened at the sight of dozens of white boxes. Spotting the yellow _Deutche Post_ labels on a few of them it only meant one thing. Why would she be here already?  
打开门，他看到几十个白色盒子，眼睛不禁睁大了。注意到其中几个贴着黄色德国邮政标签，这意味着一件事。她怎么会已经在这里了？

Finally getting into the kitchen he found a certain redhead sipping down a rather large bottle of yellowish German drink. She was wearing what almost looked like a nightgown, it hung loosely with its; red trim and rather large bow on the front.  
终于走进厨房，他发现一个红发女孩正啜饮着一大瓶黄色的德国饮料。她穿着一件几乎像是睡衣的衣服，宽松地垂挂着，前襟有一个大大的红色镶边和一个大蝴蝶结。

And of course, those A10 clips still stayed in her hair, he was glad to see that some things never changed.  
当然，那些 A10 发夹依然留在她的头发上，他很高兴看到有些东西从未改变。

"What're you doing here?" He asked, genuine surprise in is voice voice.  
“你在这里做什么？”他问道，声音中带着真切的惊讶。

She just glared at him while finishing her drink "God you're an idiot, you've obviously been replaced."  
她只是瞪着他，喝完最后一口饮料，“天啊，你真是个白痴，显然已经被替换了。”

The boy figured she was probably being serious, she actually believed that in her superiority driven mind, but he didn't care. If she wanted to use him as a verbal punching bag, he could take it, he would take it, for her.  
男孩猜想她大概是真的这么认为，在她那自以为高人一等的心里，但他不在乎。如果她想把他当作言语上的出气筒，他能承受，他会承受，为了她。

"Really?" He said with just a hint of happiness. "Alright then."  
“真的吗？”他带着一丝喜悦说道，“那好吧。”

He could play this game.  
他能玩这个游戏。

"WHA?!" The German couldn't believe what she was hearing in that voice, was that… relief? She watched dumbfounded as he looked around the room.  
"什么？！" 这位德国人无法相信她听到的声音，那是……松了一口气吗？她目瞪口呆地看着他环顾房间。

"Where'd you put my stuff?"  
"你把我的东西放哪儿了？"

She just raised an eyebrow and pointed to a small pile in the living room.  
她只是挑了挑眉，指向客厅里的一小堆物品。

Walking over to it, Shinji hid the smile on his face. He knew exactly what this called for.  
走近那儿，真嗣藏起了脸上的笑意。他清楚这需要什么。

Asuka watched the boy closely as he dug through his pile, finally reaching that rather large case she had trouble with getting out of his room.  
明日香紧盯着那个男孩，看他翻找着自己的那堆东西，最终拿出了那个相当大的箱子，她之前费了好大力气也没能从他房间里搬出来。

It was in fact a cello, one that the boy spent a moment too long looking.  
实际上，那是一把大提琴，男孩盯着它看了太久。

His hands seemed to run across the strings like a master chief would run his hands over his cutlery, and he subtlety plucked at one while tightening another.  
他的手仿佛一位大厨抚摸餐具般，熟练地在弦上滑过，同时微妙地拨动一根弦，又紧了另一根。

Taking it to the couch he sat down and just… started.  
他把它带到沙发旁坐下，然后就……开始了。

She couldn't look away, she couldn't move, she couldn't even… breath.  
她无法移开视线，无法动弹，甚至无法……呼吸。

It started, it rose, the music, it wasn't slow, it started fast, but still took its time to rise up. But there was something... missing. He played, the strings making their noises with every subtle command, every slight movement was calculated, each and every note was deliberate and precise, like he was doing this from instinct rather than memory. There was something off though, it had a duality, almost as if there was another instrument supposed to be alongside it, while beautiful on its own she would have killed to hear its' duet in that moment.  
音乐开始了，它升腾而起，不是缓慢的，而是迅速开始，但仍从容不迫地攀升。但似乎少了些什么。他弹奏着，琴弦随着每一个细微的指令发出声响，每一次轻微的动作都经过精心计算，每一个音符都刻意而精准，仿佛他是凭直觉而非记忆在演奏。然而，总感觉有些不对劲，它有一种双重性，仿佛应该有另一件乐器与之相伴，尽管它本身很美，但在那一刻，她几乎愿意付出一切去聆听那本应与之合奏的旋律。

The music mellowed, dropped, a repetitive note, no two notes, dancing the same movement together, around each other.  
音乐变得柔和，下沉，重复的音符，没有两个音符，跳着相同的舞步，彼此环绕。

Then it rose again, in that rhythm, only for it to drop and build once more.  
随后它再次升起，保持着那种节奏，只是为了再次下沉并重新构建。

This kid was good. Even she had to begrudgingly admit she wouldn't have been to execute the piece with half the skill he was.  
这孩子很出色。即便她不情愿，也不得不承认自己无法以他一半的技巧演奏这首曲子。

It built and built, it rose to the highest height it could, only for the notes to explode in a victorious crescendo, the feeling she got when listening, it almost felt like winning a battle.  
它不断攀升，达到了所能达到的最高点，音符随即在胜利的渐强中爆发，她听时的感觉，几乎像是赢得了一场战斗。

But just as fast as it came it was over, it was a sudden end, _that_ she hated, but had to accept and besides, she looked over at the clock.  
但那结束得和开始一样快，突如其来的终结，她虽憎恨却不得不接受，况且，她瞥了一眼时钟。

Only 62 seconds and he can do that?  
仅仅 62 秒，他就能做到这种程度？

She could only image what he could create in an hour.  
她只能想象他在一小时里能创造出什么。

"Getting her settled in Shinji?" Misato said from behind her, startling both of them.  
"把她安顿好，真嗣？" 美里从背后说道，吓了他们一跳。

"I didn't know you could play and so well." The Commander said as she went to the fridge and cracked open the first beer of the night, causing Asuka to raise her eyebrow again.  
"没想到你还会弹琴，还弹得这么好。" 司令官说着走向冰箱，打开今晚的第一罐啤酒，这让明日香再次挑起了眉毛。

The Third Child just set down his bow and looked over the instrument "It's just… been awhile since I played," He said, flicking off a speck of dirt "I'm probably rusty."  
第三适格者放下弓，打量着乐器，"只是……很久没弹了，"他说着，弹掉一点灰尘，"可能都生锈了。"

This boy was clearly just trying to make himself sound better, there's no way that could have been 'rusty' Asuka was sure of that.  
这个男孩显然只是在试图让自己听起来更好，那绝不可能是‘生锈’的，明日香对此确信无疑。

"So, I hear you're kicking me out." He said with a small grin on his face, while turning to the redhead.  
“所以，我听说你要把我赶出去。”他转头对红发女孩说道，脸上带着一丝微笑。

The girl just narrowed her eyes back at him, a small growl escaping her.  
女孩只是眯起眼睛回瞪着他，喉咙里发出轻微的低吼声。

Misato just watched the two, of all the things she had imagined happening once they met, Shinji getting under _Asuka's_ skin and holding his own with her was the last thing she expected.  
美里只是看着这两人，在她所有想象过的他们相遇后的情景中，真嗣能激怒明日香并与之抗衡，是她最意想不到的。

Taking off her jacket and sitting down she felt her body slowly start to unwind as she took her first sip of beer for the night.  
她脱下外套坐下，随着夜晚的第一口啤酒入口，身体慢慢放松下来。

"No, no one's getting kicked out."  
“不，没人会被赶出去。”

Asuka just turned back to the older woman, a look of annoyance clearly visible on her face.  
明日香只是转回身面对那位年长的女性，脸上明显带着不悦的表情。

"Look, if the two of you are going to work together, then you need to learn how to communicate."  
“听着，如果你们俩要一起工作，那么你们需要学会如何沟通。”

Noting the smile Shinji held as he packed his cello back in its' case, a trickle of doubt began to form in the director's mind.  
注意到真嗣收拾大提琴时脸上的微笑，导演心中开始形成一丝疑虑。

"You two are fellow pilots now, so you're going to live here together and learn to act like it."  
"你们俩现在都是驾驶员了，所以你们要一起住在这里，学会适应这种生活。"

Asuka just grumbled something under her breath as the Third Child clicked his instrument's case closed.  
明日香只是低声咕哝了一句，而第三适格者则啪的一声合上了他的仪器箱。

"By the way, that's an order." Misato said in a cheerful voice while she raised her beer for another chug.  
"顺便说一句，这是命令。" 美里用欢快的声音说道，同时举起啤酒又喝了一大口。

ʡʘʘʢ

Dishes. 菜肴。

How long had it been since he just washed dishes for the three of them?  
他们三人一起洗碗已经有多久了？

He enjoyed it, even after everything, cleaning and maintaining the apartment was almost therapeutic, a dash of normalcy. Taking chaos and turning it into order was something that relaxed him, and he was good at it too.  
他享受这个过程，即便经历了那么多，打扫和维护公寓几乎成了一种疗愈，带来一丝正常感。将混乱转化为秩序让他感到放松，而且他在这方面也很擅长。

At least in the small scale.  
至少在小事上如此。

"Anything else I should be surprised by Shinji?" Misato asked "Cooking, Language, Music, what else could a woman want?"  
“还有什么能让我对真嗣感到惊讶的吗？”美里问道，“烹饪、语言、音乐，还有什么是一个女人想要的呢？”

She had already had a few beers and now just hitting that flirty stage of intoxication, it was her nature or just a copping mechanism, whichever it was he just responded with a bit a German.  
她已经喝了几杯啤酒，现在正处在那种微醺的调情阶段，这是她的本性还是一种应对机制，无论是什么，他只是用一点德语回应了她。

Not that she heard it, he was pretty sure Asuka's screaming drowned out everything.  
并非她听到了，他相当确定明日香的尖叫声淹没了一切。

"There's a creature in here!" She yelled as Shinji heard Pen Pen's feet walking out into the dining room.  
“这里有只生物！”她大喊道，而真嗣听到佩佩的脚掌走向餐厅的声音。

He stifled a laugh, "It's just a pengui…." he stopped, there was Asuka, indecent, standing in the doorway.  
他忍住笑意，“那只是一只企鹅…”他突然停下，因为门口站着衣衫不整的明日香。

He looked away as fast as possible, his face burning and despite his quiet retreat, he still heard the wet footsteps of the redhead approach. He just couldn't catch a break, could he?  
他迅速移开视线，脸颊发烫，尽管他悄悄退开，仍能听到红发女孩湿漉漉的脚步声靠近。他真是倒霉透顶，不是吗？

The foot he blocked, but it just meant he had to look at her.  
他挡住了那一脚，但这只是意味着他不得不面对她。

_He was in the hospital again, standing over her.  
他又在医院里，站在她上方。_

"_Go on baka, take a look, you know you want to." She whispered into his ear._  
“继续啊，笨蛋，看吧，你知道你想看的。”她在他耳边低语。

His eyes bore into her blue ones, his gaze not once leaving them.  
他的目光深邃，直视着她湛蓝的双眸，视线未曾移开片刻。

She on the other hand couldn't believe he blocked her leg, which was now held in the air.  
而她则难以置信地看着他挡住了她的腿，那条腿此刻正悬在空中。

They both just stood there, tensed, and ready for anything, each daring the other to make the first move.  
两人就这样僵持着，紧绷着神经，随时准备应对任何情况，彼此都在挑衅对方先出手。

"You should really put some clothes on." Shinji just deadpanned as Misato crashed back on her chair laughing drunkenly at the whole situation.  
"你真该穿点衣服。" 真嗣面无表情地说道，而美里则醉醺醺地大笑着，瘫回椅子上，对整个情景感到好笑。

ʡʘʘʢ

Asuka watched as the boy retreated to his room. With her new guardian downing another beer, she was sure that this would be her shot at finding out about those rumors that had reached Berlin.  
明日香看着男孩退回自己的房间。她的新监护人又开了一罐啤酒，她确信这将是一个机会，去探寻那些传到柏林的流言。

"Now Asuka…" Misato said in a rather sloppy tone. "If you see Shinji walking around at night, just come get me, 'kay?".  
"现在，明日香……" 美里用相当含糊的语气说道，"如果你看到真嗣晚上四处走动，就来找我，好吗？".

Asuka looked at the 20 something year old in confusion, "What's that supposed to mean, I'm not going to have to worry about sleeping in the same apartment with a perv am I?"  
明日香困惑地看着那位二十多岁的年轻人，“那是什么意思，我不会得担心和个变态睡在同一间公寓里吧？”

Taking another chug of her beer Misato shuttered as she slammed the can down on the table "No no, he's got *burp* he's been sleepwalking, just leave him be and don't try to wake him, promise me alright?"  
美里又灌了一口啤酒，猛地将罐子拍在桌上，打了个嗝后颤抖着说：“不不，他只是*嗝*梦游，别管他，也别试图叫醒他，答应我好吗？”

The gears turned in the Germans head, what was this about?  
德国人的脑海中思绪翻涌，这到底是怎么回事？

"Only if you answer my question." She said with a devilish smile.  
"只有你回答我的问题。" 她带着一丝狡黠的微笑说道。

Misato shrugged, waving her can "Ask away…" taking another gulp.  
美里耸了耸肩，挥动着手中的罐子，"问吧……" 又喝了一大口。

"What _really_ happened with the Sixth Angel?"  
"第六使徒到底发生了什么？"

The woman froze, instantly Asuka knew there was some truth behind the rumors. Something _had_ happened that NERV covered up, wiped clean from the report.  
女人僵住了，阿斯克立刻明白那些传闻并非空穴来风。一定有什么事被 NERV 掩盖了，从报告中抹得一干二净。

Setting the can down slowly, Misato's face fell, she shut her eyes and she cocked her head like she was hearing something.  
缓缓放下罐子，美里神情一沉，闭上双眼，歪着头，仿佛在聆听什么。

"Maybe it's only fair I tell you…" she mumbled, before standing up. Tossing the can, she went straight for the fridge and cracked open another one as well as handing one down to Pen Pen who had followed her.  
“或许我该告诉你……”她咕哝着，随即站起身来。她随手扔掉空罐，径直走向冰箱，又开了一罐，顺手递给跟来的 Pen Pen。

Shotgunning that one, she picked out a second and just stood there leaning against the fridge.  
她迅速喝完那罐啤酒，又挑了一罐，只是站在冰箱旁靠着。

Waiting for her to continue, Asuka's eyes drifted to the small dent in the side of the fridge, but that was a question for another time.  
等待她继续说下去，明日香的目光飘向了冰箱侧面的小凹痕，但那是另一个时间的问题了。

"I failed him…" she mumbled, looking towards the Third Child's bedroom "I convinced him to come back… and I…."  
“我辜负了他……”她喃喃自语，目光投向第三适格者的卧室，“我劝他回来了……而我……”

Glancing down at the redhead, the director pushed herself off the fridge and stumbled her way to the table once more.  
瞥了一眼红发女孩，指挥官从冰箱上撑起身，踉跄地再次走向桌子。

"So… it's true, something did happen?"  
"所以…是真的，确实发生了什么事？"

Misato said nothing, she just rested her head on the table and stared at the Second Child, no _through_ her at something else.  
美里什么也没说，只是将头靠在桌上，凝视着第二适格者，或者说，透过她看着别的东西。

"I guess you got to read the report bout the Sixth Angel then hmm?"  
"我猜你已经读过关于第六使徒的报告了吧，嗯？"

Asuka just leaned in and nodded. The report had said the Third Child was in critical condition after being attacked by the Angel the instant he was deployed. From there it had only said he'd been stabilized and patched up enough to get back out and fight.  
明日香只是倾身点了点头。报告上说，第三适格者在被派遣的瞬间遭到使徒攻击，情况危急。之后只提到他已被稳定并简单处理，足以重返战场。

Everyone who had any friends or contacts in the Japanese base said otherwise. She'd heard everything from the pilot's arms had been severed and reattached, to NERV needing to give him a synthetic heart after his exploded.  
所有在日本基地有朋友或联系的人都说情况并非如此。她听到的说法五花八门，从驾驶员的手臂被切断又重新接上，到 NERV 在他心脏爆炸后不得不给他植入人工心脏。

"Everyone in Berlin told me something different, but everyone thinks something happened to the pilot of Unit-01."  
柏林的每个人告诉我的都不一样，但大家都认为零一机驾驶员发生了什么事。

Closing her eyes, it seemed like Misato was trembling to the redhead. What could have happened for her to be like this?  
闭上眼睛，Misato 似乎在红发女孩面前颤抖。究竟发生了什么，让她变成这样？

"Six hours…" she mumbled, much to Asuka's interest.  
"六个小时……"她喃喃自语，引起了 Asuka 的兴趣。

"He was dead for six hours…" her eyes rose up to meet the girl's and she couldn't describe how much pain was held in them.  
"他已经死了六个小时……"她的目光抬起，与女孩对视，她无法形容眼中蕴含的痛苦有多深。

"Dead?" “死了？”

Misato nodded "No pulse, no brainwaves…. Nothing."  
美里点头道：“没有脉搏，没有脑电波……什么都没有。”

She picked herself off the table and shrugged. "Then he was back…" she said taking another long swig of her beer.  
她从桌子上起身，耸了耸肩。“然后他又回来了……”她边说边又喝了一大口啤酒。

"You mean?" "你是说？"

Misato nodded "They found him in the Geofront," she said with a small smile "alive... with no memory past the Fourth Angel."  
美里点头道：“他们在地底都市找到了他，”她带着一丝微笑说，“还活着……但失去了第四使徒之后的所有记忆。”

"That's ridiculous." "这太荒谬了。"

Shrugging Misato pushed herself to her feet "Yeah, yeah it is… but I don't know what I'd do to myself if…" she stopped.  
米佐托耸了耸肩，挣扎着站起身来，“是啊，是啊，确实是……但我不敢想象如果……”她突然停住了。

There was nothing for the girl to say, no words that could come to her that could address the sight of the older woman.  
女孩无言以对，没有任何话语能表达她对这位年长女性的所见所感。

"Don't be spreading this around, Ritsuko's already having a stroke trying to figure out why."  
“别到处传，律子已经在抓狂了，她正试图弄清楚原因。”

"Don't _you_ have a theory?"  
"你难道没有什么理论吗？"

Misato just shook her head, reaching over and placing her hand on the girl's shoulder, the older woman just smiled sadly.  
美里只是摇了摇头，伸手搭在女孩的肩上，这位年长的女性只是悲伤地笑了笑。

"No, he's alive and..." "不，他还活着，而且......"

.

.

.

"Miracles don't need value." she mumbled as he eyes drooped.  
“奇迹无需价值。”她喃喃自语，眼皮渐渐沉重。

A quiet moment was shared between the two, Asuka's mind spun, trying to comprehend how something like that was possible. She had so many more questions, but the violet-haired director spoke first.  
两人间静谧片刻，明日香思绪翻涌，试图理解这样的事情何以可能。她有太多疑问，但紫发导演率先开口。

"I'm off to bed, goodnight Asuka." Misato said, stumbling off to her room.  
“我去睡了，晚安，明日香。”美里说着，踉跄地走向自己的房间。

She sat at the table for a few more minutes, just digesting what she had heard. Why was it the more she learned about the Third Child the less she understood about him?  
她又在桌前坐了几分钟，只是消化着刚刚听到的信息。为什么她越是了解三子，就越发觉得他难以捉摸呢？

**Alright, I'll get chapter 10 out on Monday or Tuesday. One or two chapters a week seems like a good pace.  
好的，我会在周一或周二发布《1001》第 10 章。每周一到两章的进度看起来挺合适的。**

**Shoutouts! 致谢！**

**Dragon5847- Thanks, I'm glad you're enjoying the story. I don't like to put too much in the summary just because I think it takes a bit away from people finding it out through the story. I'll probably be doing 2 chapters a week now, just so I'm not going too fast.  
Dragon5847——感谢，很高兴你喜欢这个故事。我不太喜欢在摘要里透露太多，因为我觉得这样会减少读者通过故事本身发现惊喜的乐趣。现在我可能会每周更新两章，以免进度太快。**

**UltraSpink of Da USA- Thanks! I don't see many Rebuild stories either, the whole 'dead Shinji' idea actually came from how different that scenes with Ramiel are between the two series. Honestly it sounds like Shinji is being tortured when it happens in Rebuild and Misato just kinda fumbles and hesitates to bring him back down unlike in NGE. At least in my opinion, plus that voice actor did a fantastic job with those screams, just saying.  
Da USA 的 UltraSpink——谢谢！我也确实没看到太多《Rebuild》的故事，那个‘死去的真嗣’的想法其实源自两部系列中拉米尔场景的差异。说实话，在《Rebuild》里听起来真嗣像是在受折磨，而美里只是有些笨拙和犹豫，没有像在《EVA》里那样果断地带他下来。至少在我看来是这样，而且那位声优在那些尖叫声中的表现确实非常出色，仅此而已。**

**Until Next Time  下次再见**

### Chapter 10: "…I don't know how you were inverted…"  
Chapter 10: "…我不知道你是怎么被反转的…"

_Two pilots in a single entry plug really made for a terrible experience.  
两个飞行员共用一个插入栓，这体验真是糟糕透顶。_

_Shinji was wrestling the controls with Asuka all the while the girl barked insults at him.  
真嗣正与明日香争夺着操纵杆，而那女孩则不停地对他恶语相向。_

_They were still stuck in the mouth of Gaghiel and Misato had just informed them about the two battleships currently on their way to meet them. That would be fine and dandy if it weren't for one small problem.  
他们仍被困在伽吉尔的口中，美里刚刚通知他们有两艘战舰正朝他们驶来。如果不是有一个小问题，这本该是件好事。_

_He was doing his best sync with Unit-02 without resorting to reaching out to the soul of Asuka's mother inside. If he did that and the Second Children felt the existence of her mother who knew what kinds of turmoil the redhead would be subjected to.  
他在不触及明日香母亲灵魂的情况下，尽全力与二号机同步。如果他那样做了，而二号机驾驶员感受到了她母亲的存在，谁知道红发女孩会经历怎样的内心动荡。_

_Not to mention the questions she'd be asking.  
更别提她会问的那些问题了。_

_Then again, it would be a better alternative than both of them dying right here.  
不过话说回来，这总比他们俩都死在这里要好。_

"_You only have 20 seconds, get those jaws open now!" Misato shouted at them through the comms._  
“你们只有 20 秒，现在就把那些下巴打开！”美里通过通讯器对他们喊道。

_Shinji could tell he was failing miserably, his own damn hesitation and emotions getting the better of him with her so close.  
真嗣能感觉到自己失败得一塌糊涂，他自己的犹豫和情感在她如此接近时占了上风。_

_He never did change. 他从未改变过。_

"Do it baka Shinji, you're both going to die!" She was right after all, there were no alternatives.  
“快做啊，笨蛋真嗣，你们俩都会死的！”毕竟她是对的，没有其他选择了。

_Taking in a nose full of LCL he closed his eyes and reached out his mind to the deepest parts of Unit-02. Even further than he had to look for this mother in Unit-01. His mother's mind and soul hadn't been torn apart like Asuka's mother's.  
吸入一口 LCL，他闭上眼睛，将意识延伸至二号机最深处。比他在初号机中寻找母亲时还要深入。他母亲的意识和灵魂并未像明日香母亲那样被撕裂。_

_There was nothing, he could feel nothing, at least nothing that_ he _could find._  
那里空无一物，他什么也感觉不到，至少找不到任何东西。

"Kyoko!" it was like shouting into an abyss, but what else was he supposed to do? "Asuka needs you!".  
“恭子！”这就像对着深渊呐喊，但他还能做什么呢？“明日香需要你！”

_Unaware of her co-piolt's frantic search beyond the physical plane, Asuka could only feel the Third's lapse in concentration and growled at the perceived incompetence.  
未察觉到她的副驾驶在物理平面之外的疯狂搜寻，明日香只能感受到第三适格者注意力的缺失，并对这种被视为无能的表现咆哮起来。_

"_Third?! What are you…" the Second Children was stopped mid-sentence with a sensation she had never felt before._  
“第三适格者？！你在做什么…”第二适格者话音未落，便感受到了一种前所未有的感觉。

_Time seemed to slow as she felt a connection with the Evangelion that she never had before. Like an adrenaline surge she was acutely aware of everything now, the Angel, the Third Children, and something else, and now she had the strength to push open those jaws.  
时间仿佛放慢了脚步，她与福音战士之间建立了一种前所未有的联系。如同肾上腺素激增，她现在对一切都异常敏锐，包括使徒、第三适格者，还有其他什么东西，而现在她拥有了推开那些巨颚的力量。_

_Doing so in the nick of time, the two battleships came crashing down, jamming themselves into the mouth. The resulting explosion from their main armament sending them skyrocketing to the surface.  
在千钧一发之际，两艘战舰轰然坠落，卡在了巨口之中。它们主炮引发的爆炸将它们猛地推向水面。_

_Then… the only thing she could compare what came next was sensory overload. The entry plug seemed to dissolve as she felt the presence of something warm reaching out to her. It was so warm, so pleasant, so encompassing that she never wanted it to leave her.  
随后……她唯一能想到的比喻就是感官超载。驾驶舱仿佛溶解了，她感受到一股温暖的存在向她伸来。它是如此温暖、如此愉悦、如此包容，以至于她再也不想让它离开。_

_Then it was gone, much to her fury, washed away from something else.  
然而它突然消失了，令她愤怒不已，被另一种力量冲刷而去。_

_Something cold. 某种冰冷的东西。_

_She wasn't in an EVA anymore, she was standing somewhere else, watching… herself?  
她不再穿着 EVA 装，而是站在另一个地方，看着……自己？_

_What had just transpired earlier on_ Over the Rainbow_, but not exactly?_  
刚才在《彩虹之上》发生了什么，但又不太一样？

_Suddenly images flashed in front of her, EVAs, Angels, Tokyo-03, things she'd never seen. The images came and went like a slideshow, only a few seconds until the next, faster and faster until it was hard to make out anything but a blur.  
突然间，影像在她眼前闪现，EVA、使徒、东京-03，都是她从未见过的。这些画面如幻灯片般来去匆匆，每幅停留不过几秒，速度越来越快，直至模糊一片，难以辨认。_

_Then she was standing there alone in some crater. No, some warzone, she was rising up out of the ground, the wind whipping around here in a cyclone, some sort of spear in her hands.  
接着她独自站在某个弹坑中。不，是某个战场，她正从地面升起，狂风在她周围形成旋风，手中握着某种长矛。_

_Then she saw it. 接着她看到了它。_

"_No…"_ “不……”

_Those pale winged creatures, they circled in the sky, fleshy chunks of meat hung in their talons and their mouths with oversized grins.  
那些苍白的带翼生物，在空中盘旋，它们的爪子和嘴里挂着血淋淋的肉块，露出夸张的笑容。_

_Somehow, she_ knew _it was Unit-02._  
不知为何，她知道那是二号机。

_And somehow, she_ knew _she had been inside._  
不知为何，她知道她曾身在其中。

"Look what he did to us."  
“看看他都对我们做了什么。”

Asuka spun around only to see… herself standing there, half bandaged and bloodied.  
明日香转过身来，却看到……另一个自己站在那里，半身缠着绷带，血迹斑斑。

_It was only the Second Children's blood curdling scream that brought Shinji back to reality.  
正是第二适格者那令人血液凝固的尖叫声，将真嗣拉回了现实。_

_She grabbed her head and pushed him away from her. The Third Children didn't understand what was happening. They were both on the opposite sides of the controls, with Asuka now curling up on herself, still clutching her head as she shook it.  
她抱住头，将他推开。第三适格者不明白发生了什么。两人分别站在控制台的两边，明日香此刻蜷缩成一团，依旧紧抓着头部，摇着头。_

"_Nonononononono." She just mumbled to herself._  
“不不不不不不。”她只是喃喃自语。

"_Asuka?" he asked, reaching out across the controls to her._  
"明日香？" 他问道，伸手越过控制台向她。

"_Get the fuck away from me!" she screamed hysterically at him, pushing herself up against the side of the entry plug._  
"滚开！" 她歇斯底里地对他尖叫，将自己紧贴在插入栓的侧壁上。

_Surprised by the outburst Shinji recoiled as well, those blue eyes of hers just stared at him, her skin deathly white even in the LCL. He could see the rapid raising and lowering of her chest, she was hyperventilating.  
被这突如其来的爆发吓了一跳，真嗣也向后退缩，她那双蓝色的眼睛只是盯着他，她的皮肤即使在 LCL 中也是死一般的苍白。他能看到她胸口的快速起伏，她在过度换气。_

_What just happened? 刚刚发生了什么？_

"_Asuka, are you alright?" he asked softly._  
“明日香，你还好吗？”他轻声问道。

_She said nothing, she just looked at him with something that he'd never seen on her face before.  
她一言不发，只是用一种他从未在她脸上见过的表情看着他。_

_Terror. 恐惧。_

_Absolute. Pure. Terror. 绝对的。纯粹的。恐惧。_

"_Wha…"_ “什…”

"_I_ saw _it." She whispered_  
"我看到了。" 她低声说

"_I_ saw her_."_ "我看见她了。"

Turning to her left, she could now see with her own physical eyes that bandaged version of herself, just resting on the back of the pilot's seat, its head cupped by bandaged hands.  
转向左边，她现在能用自己的肉眼看到那个缠着绷带的自己，正静静地靠在驾驶员座椅的背面，头部被绷带包裹的双手托着。

A massive grin on its' face.  
脸上挂着巨大的笑容。

"Well… isn't that interesting?"  
“嗯……这不是很有趣吗？”

_With speed Shinji thought impossible, Asuka reached and smashed the emergency eject button. The two of them braced for the g-forces as the plug was released from the EVA and the third member of their group vanished, at least to the eyes of the Second Children.  
以真嗣认为不可能的速度，明日香伸手按下了紧急弹射按钮。两人在插入栓从 EVA 中弹出时做好了承受 G 力的准备，而他们小组的第三名成员消失了，至少在第二适格者的眼中是这样。_

_Both just looked at each other as the LCL drained from the tube, Asuka's eyes remained wide like some animal backed into a corner, waiting for its predator to make the first move.  
两人只是互相对视着，随着 LCL 从管道中排空，明日香的双眼依旧睁得大大的，就像一只被逼到角落的动物，等待着捕食者先行动。_

_Her wet hair matted against her skin as the LCL drained, the last bits of it falling off her skin making it look like she was drenched in blood.  
随着 LCL 排空，她湿漉漉的头发紧贴在皮肤上，最后几滴液体从她皮肤上滑落，让她看起来像是浑身浸透了鲜血。_

_Neither said anything as the LCL dropped down and bellow their chests, all that could be heard were the last droplets falling from the top of the plug.  
随着 LCL 下降并涌向他们的胸口，两人都没有说话，只能听到插头顶部最后几滴液体滴落的声音。_

"_What the hell are you?"_  
“你到底是什么鬼东西？”

ʡʘʘʢ

She laid there, completely unable to fall asleep with this unfamiliar ceiling above her.  
她躺在那里，完全无法入睡，因为头顶是这陌生的天花板。

Her room was a mess, boxes half torn open, clothes thrown into piles, books and papers strew about without a home. To think she wasn't even half-finished unpacking.  
她的房间一片狼藉，箱子半开半合，衣服堆成一堆，书本和纸张四处散落，无家可归。想想她连一半都没整理完。

Asuka raised the raggedy hand puppet/doll up in front of her, its wide eyes seemed to enlarge with the surrounding darkness.  
明日香举起那只破旧的手偶/玩偶，在周围的黑暗中，它的眼睛似乎显得更大了。

"You know you're better than they are."  
"你知道你比他们强。"

"They aren't special the way you are."  
"他们不像你那样特别。"

"Nothing's changed, it's just like before, you're still better off relying on yourself Asuka." She finished weakly.  
"什么都没变，还是和以前一样，你最好还是靠自己，明日香。" 她无力地结束了这番话。"

Her mind drifted back to getting to sleep, but she didn't want to face those nightmares again, she didn't want to have to relive those things.  
她的思绪飘回到入睡的时刻，但她不愿再次面对那些梦魇，不想被迫重温那些往事。

She shook her head and put the puppet down, rolling over, she tried to shut her eyes, only to hear some rather dull thumping's from the room across from hers'.  
她摇了摇头，放下手中的木偶，翻身试图闭上眼睛，却只听到从对面房间传来一阵沉闷的敲击声。

Perhaps he did sleepwalk after all.  
或许他真的会梦游。

Just another thing to add to the list of oddities that was the Third Child.  
这不过是第三适格者身上众多怪异之处中的又一项罢了。

ʡʘʘʢ

"I don't know." “我不知道。”

He whispered those words to himself as his eyes opened.  
他轻声自语，双眼缓缓睁开。

That had been the first life where anyone knew about him. Let's just say that had been a less then optimal way of Asuka finding out.  
那是第一个有人知晓他存在的生命。这么说吧，那次让明日香发现的方式可不怎么理想。

He was careful not to let that happen a second time. He figured it was a kind of micro-instrumentality between those within the entry plug of an EVA if both pilot's sync rates rose high enough.  
他小心翼翼，不让这种情况再次发生。他认为，如果两位驾驶员的同步率都足够高，那么在 EVA 插入栓内的他们之间就会产生一种微妙的共感。

He found that when the two pilots synced high enough, to the borderline of dissolving into LCL like he had, it became more a link with each other than purely with the Evangelion. Almost as if the Evangelion was the conduit between the two.  
他发现，当两位驾驶员的同步率足够高，几乎要像他那样溶解在 LCL 中时，他们之间的联系变得比单纯与 EVA 的联系更为紧密。仿佛 EVA 成了两者之间的桥梁。

It had taken him a long time before he trusted himself to get back in an entry plug with her, even longer till he was certain it would never happen again.  
他花了很长时间才敢再次与她一同进入插入栓，更久之后才确信这种情况不会再发生。

The boy sighed at the memories and resigned himself to the day by rolling off his mattress. He dragged himself to the bathroom and went about getting ready for the day.  
男孩对着回忆叹了口气，无奈地从床垫上滚下来，拖着身子走向浴室，开始准备新的一天。

With a splash of water on his face he looked at himself in the mirror. Again those dark circles under his eyes told him no matter what happened he'd probably never get a full night of dreamless sleep ever again.  
他往脸上泼了些水，对着镜子中的自己。那双眼睛下的黑眼圈再次告诉他，无论发生什么，他可能再也得不到一个无梦的完整夜晚了。

It's not like he deserved to either.  
他也不配得到。

_I am poison to everyone around me.  
我是周围所有人的毒药。_

"I am Shinji Ikari… Third Children… Pilot of Evangelion Unit-01." He whispered to himself.  
“我是碇真嗣……第三适格者……EVA 初号机的驾驶员。”他低声自语。

Exiting, he found himself face to face with a very annoyed redhead who scolded him for taking so long. Simply shrugging off the encounter, he went to the kitchen to make a small breakfast and lunch for the three of them.  
出门后，他迎面碰上了一个非常不悦的红发女孩，对方因他耽搁太久而责备他。他只是耸耸肩，没把这事放在心上，然后去厨房为他们三人准备了一份简单的早餐和午餐。

"Alright you two, have a good day!" Misato called to them as she went to her own room to get dressed "Don't forget your first sync test together is after school!"  
"好了，你们俩，祝你们今天过得愉快！" 美里朝他们喊道，然后回到自己的房间去换衣服，"别忘了放学后你们要一起进行第一次同步测试！"

Shinji responded with pleasantries as Asuka just walked out the door grumbling something too low for him to hear. Heading out the door after her, the girl had just started off without him.  
真嗣礼貌地回应着，而明日香只是咕哝着什么，声音太低他听不清，便走出了门。他跟着她出门，发现女孩已经自顾自地走了，没等他。

"Don't you want to know how to get there?" he called after her.  
“你不想知道怎么去那儿吗？”他朝她喊道。

"I already know the way Third, you'll just slow me down!" she called back as he pace quickened.  
"我早就知道路了，老三，你只会拖慢我的速度！" 她回头喊道，脚步也随之加快。

Shrugging, he decided for now it'd be best to just let her go.  
他耸了耸肩，决定眼下最好还是让她先走。

At least that was what he tried to do. Instead, he found himself managing to keep a steady distance between them. The thought occurred to him that this could be considered stalking, but they went to the same school, what was he supposed to do take another route?  
至少他是这么尝试的。然而，他却发现自己始终能保持与她一定的距离。他突然想到这可能算是跟踪，但他们上同一所学校，他还能怎么办，换条路走吗？

Besides it was simply too easy to spot her in a crowd, how many redheads had A-10 clips in their hair?  
再说，她在人群中实在太显眼了，有几个红发女孩会在头发里夹着 A-10 的夹子呢？

Finally meeting up with the stooges, Shinji let himself be slowed down by the two of them. The familiar feeling of normalcy came over him as they walked and chatted about things that he really didn't find important.  
终于与那帮家伙碰头，真嗣被他们俩拖慢了脚步。随着他们边走边聊那些他并不觉得重要的事情，那种熟悉的正常感又回来了。

Perhaps he could let himself feel a bit of this. A bit of the lightness that came from this world.  
也许他可以让自己感受一下这种轻松。来自这个世界的轻盈感。

"_Always the same baka Shinji, you're going to regret that." She called from behind him, probably not wanting to be near the stooges._  
“总是这么笨的 Shinji，你会后悔的。”她从他身后喊道，可能是不想靠近那些跟班。

_I know. 我知道。_

ʡʘʘʢ

"Guten Morgen." He said softly so that only she could hear.  
“早上好。”他轻声说道，只有她能听见。

She looked up at him, "**[Do you want something?]**" she growled in annoyance at being disturbed.  
她抬头看着他，"[你想要什么吗？]" 她因被打扰而恼怒地咆哮道。

He just smiled and sat down across from the redhead.  
他只是微笑着，在红发女孩对面坐下。

It hadn't even been an hour after he got to class that it clicked for him, after all, when Asuka acted like _that_ in front of the class, it was jarring to say the least.  
他到教室还不到一个小时，一切就豁然开朗了。毕竟，当明日香在全班面前那样表现时，至少可以说是非常令人震惊的。

Unlike every time when she had gotten up and wrote her name boldly on the board, how she had attracted every soul's attention in the class, this time she had just scowled at the class, and said nothing more than her name. That sense of nostalgia for his first life had been utterly shattered with the sight.  
与以往每次她起身在黑板上大胆写下自己名字，吸引全班目光的情景不同，这次她只是对着全班皱了皱眉，除了报出自己的名字外，再无多言。那股对第一世回忆的怀念之情，在看到这一幕后彻底破碎了。

She had been hostile to just about every person who talked to her or even came close to her. By lunch every single classmate had been afraid to even approach and eat lunch with the German.  
她对几乎每一个与她交谈或靠近她的人都怀有敌意。到了午餐时间，全班同学都害怕得不敢接近那位德国人，甚至连一起吃午饭都不敢。

Even Hikari who was doing her best, (probably due to a sense of duty as class rep) had been beaten back by the irate redhead.  
就连尽职尽责（或许是作为班长的责任感驱使）的 Hikari，也被那位愤怒的红发女孩击退了。

Last time she relished in her popularity. She loved being the center of attention, the new foreign student, who climbed the social hierarchy with ease and played the intricate (albeit unimportant) 'political' schoolyard system.  
上次她还陶醉于自己的受欢迎程度。她喜欢成为众人瞩目的焦点，那个轻松攀登社交阶梯、巧妙玩转（尽管无关紧要）校园政治体系的新来外国学生。

Now… well… antisocial was putting it lightly.  
现在……嗯……用‘反社会’来形容都算轻描淡写了。

And it was more than slightly off-putting to him.  
这让他感到不止是轻微的不适。

A moment ago, the stooges had tried to get him to sit back down, with cries and pleads that he'd be decapitated if he got too close to the fiery German. Shinji had simply smiled and said he'd be back, only to receive fake tears. Kensuke stated he'd write the eulogy and he was pretty sure there were dibs put on his belongings as well.  
就在刚才，那几个跟班试图让他重新坐下，哭喊着说他如果靠得太近，会被那火爆的德国人斩首。真嗣只是微笑着说他一会儿就回来，结果只换来了假惺惺的眼泪。健介说他要写悼词，而且他相当确定有人已经对他的遗物打了赌。

Now he was in the crosshairs of the dragon and well within striking distance to.  
现在他正处在龙的瞄准线上，完全进入了攻击范围。

"**[You don't seem like the kind that wants help, but if you can't read kanji…]**" he said in her native tongue, eyeing the open book that seemed to be stuck on the first page.  
他用她的母语说道：“[你看起来不像那种需要帮助的人，但如果你不识汉字的话……]”他瞥了一眼那本似乎卡在第一页的书。

"**[I don't need your help!]**" she barked back at him.  
"[我不需要你的帮助！]" 她对他厉声回道。

He smiled softly at her, but he hesitated.  
他温柔地对她微笑，但犹豫了。

He never changed. 他从未改变。

"**[You don't** _**want**_ **my help.]**" he corrected.  
"[你不需要我的帮助。]" 他纠正道。

She just narrowed her eyes at him, but he couldn't help but feel giddy for some reason.  
她只是眯起眼睛看着他，但他不知为何就是忍不住感到一阵兴奋。

"**[I get the feeling you're plenty far ahead.]**" he said changing the subject, **[Being an officer and all],** he was definitely stroking her ego.  
"[我感觉你已经领先很多了。]" 他换了个话题说道，[作为一名军官嘛]，他无疑是在抚慰她的自尊心。

He could see her hands starting to grip her Wonderswan tighter, she seemed to play the thing nonstop, even being able to hide it from the teacher while the old man lectured. Shinji thought back to his old self, listening for hours to the same tracks on his SDAT player.  
他注意到她的双手开始更紧地握住 Wonderswan，她似乎无时无刻不在玩这个东西，甚至在老教师讲课时也能巧妙地将其隐藏起来。真嗣回想起过去的自己，曾经连续几小时反复听着 SDAT 播放器里的同一首曲子。

No… he wouldn't let her drown out her world to.  
不……他不会让她淹没在自己的世界里。

He wouldn't let her be consumed by that pit, not again.  
他不会让她再次被那个深渊吞噬。

The girl glared at him, he was agitating her, but she needed it, she needed _this_ if she had a past anything like Soryu had.  
女孩瞪着他，他在激怒她，但她需要这样，如果她的过去和宗介有任何相似之处，她就需要这个。

Or if she wanted to avoid what had happened to the girl.  
或者如果她想避免那个女孩遭遇的事情。

_Speaking of his lovely companion, he had been doing his best to keep his focus on his laptop while she went around creatively insulting classmates around the room during the morning lectures. The Third Children had to admit some of the jabs had been rather amusing, which only made the bandaged girl more aggravated.  
说到他可爱的同伴，尽管她上午在课堂上四处巧妙地嘲讽同学，他一直尽力将注意力集中在笔记本电脑上。第三儿童不得不承认，其中一些讽刺颇为有趣，这反而让那位包扎着的女孩更加恼火。_

"**[If you don't want to be bothered, ask her to change your seat next to mine.]**" he said, motioning to the pigtailed brunette in the room.  
“[如果你不想被打扰，让她把你调到我旁边的座位。]”他说着，示意房间里那位扎着马尾辫的棕发女孩。

"**[Also,]** he pulled out a wrapped lunch from behind him **"[don't forget your lunch next time.]"**  
“[还有，]他从身后拿出一个包好的午餐”“[下次别忘了带午餐。]”

Her brow furrowed, **"[I didn't forget it!]"** she hissed at him.  
她皱起眉头，“[我没忘记！]”她对他低声怒道。

Shinji shook his head and stood up **"[I know you didn't.]"**.  
真嗣摇了摇头，站起身来，“[我知道你没那么做。]”

He took his leave, he was beginning to be too pushy, he knew it.  
他知道自己开始显得过于咄咄逼人了，于是决定离开。

Asuka glared at the boy as he made his way to Rei's table, another lunch in his hands. Unwrapping the food, she looked down at the expertly cooked meal.  
当男孩拿着另一份午餐走向丽的位置时，明日香瞪着他。她解开食物的包装，低头看着这份精心烹制的餐点。

The Third Child was still a mystery.  
第三适任者依旧是个谜。

"Finally, back in class Rei?" Shinji asked the bluenette.  
“终于回教室了，丽？”真嗣向蓝发女孩问道。

She made no notion that she actually heard the boy, instead she continued staring out the window for a moment longer.  
她没有任何表示自己听到了男孩的话，反而继续凝视窗外片刻。

"Rei?" he asked again, only to have the clone finally turn to look up at him, then down at the food in his hand.  
“丽？”他再次问道，终于，那个克隆体转过身来，抬头看向他，然后又低头看向他手中的食物。

To the Third Children, Rei's outward appearance seemed a hair more like his mother's than other times. Perhaps it was just him, but he swore he could see it.  
对于第三适格者来说，丽的外表似乎比平时更像他的母亲。也许这只是他的错觉，但他发誓他能看出来。

It wasn't too important, what was important was if she still held the same purpose as before. Judging by the amount of time absent from class, he'd wager a bet that she was.  
这并不太重要，重要的是她是否还保持着与之前相同的目的。从她缺课的时间来看，他敢打赌她确实如此。

The conduit for the Third Impact, and at least partially, the one who put him in this mess just took the food from his hands slowly, the same blank face as always just looked at him.  
作为第三次冲击的媒介，至少在一定程度上，那个把他卷入这团乱麻的人，正慢慢地从他手中拿走食物，一如既往地面无表情地看着他。

"Thank you." She said meekly  
“谢谢。”她怯生生地说。

He tried to think of something to say, something, anything. Instead, his mind just traveled to what Misato had reminded him of earlier.  
他试图想出要说的话，任何话都行。然而，他的思绪却飘向了美里之前提醒他的事情。

"Are you going to be ok for the sync test after school?" he asked, the words almost bumbling out of his mouth.  
"放学后的同步测试，你没问题吧？" 他问道，话语几乎是从嘴里蹦出来的。

Rei blinked, like she was processing what he had just said.  
丽眨了眨眼，仿佛在处理他刚刚说的话。

"Yes, why wouldn't I be?"  
"当然，我怎么会不行呢？"

"_Congrats, Wonder Girl, you're still the same even in this messed up world!" Soryu called out from the other side of class._  
“恭喜啊，奇迹少女，即便在这混乱的世界里，你依旧如初！”Soryu 在教室的另一头喊道。

Ignoring her, Shinji just shrugged "You've been absent for a while."  
无视她，真嗣只是耸了耸肩，“你已经缺席一段时间了。”

Rei nodded "I have duties with NERV."  
绫波点点头，“我在 NERV 有职责。”

Shinji knew exactly what those duties were, nice long cozy times floating in an LCL tube. He had to admit it was a rather dull experience, one that he had not been fond of.  
真嗣清楚那些职责是什么，就是在 LCL 管道里漂浮的漫长而舒适的时光。他不得不承认，这是一段相当乏味的经历，他并不喜欢。

Taking his leave, he went back to Toji and Kensuke, who both acted rather dramatically at his return.  
告辞后，他回到东治和真希波身边，两人对他的归来表现得相当戏剧化。

'All hail the conquering hero!'  
'向凯旋的英雄致敬！'

'Slayer of the Ice Queen and Red Dragon!'  
'冰霜女王与赤龙屠戮者！'

A quick hushed remark about Toji asking Hikari to the Spring Dance was all it took to get the attention off of him and onto the now blushing jock.  
只需一句关于冬二邀请光参加春舞会的低声议论，便成功将众人的注意力从他身上转移到了此刻脸红的运动员身上。

Things continued on that way till the end of the lunch break, when Shinji found he just needed a quick walk.  
午餐休息时间就这样持续到结束，直到真嗣发现自己只需要快速散个步。

Getting permission to use the restroom, he let his feet take him through the halls.  
他获得使用洗手间的许可后，便任由双脚带他在走廊间穿梭。

_Of course, he wasn't alone, but if anyone else were there they wouldn't have heard the second set of footsteps alongside him.  
当然，他并非独自一人，但如果还有其他人在场，他们也不会听到与他并行的第二串脚步声。_

"_So, she's not that impressive after all," Asuka said, her arms crossed over her chest "didn't even go to college, I_ graduated _before I came to Japan."_  
"这么说，她也没那么了不起嘛，" 明日香双臂交叉在胸前，"连大学都没上过，我来日本之前就已经毕业了。"

"_And that game she plays, what's with that, it's almost as pathetic as you!"_  
"还有她玩的那游戏，搞什么啊，简直跟你一样可悲！"

"You could've been just like her." He mumbled as his feet took him through a random open door.  
“你本可以像她一样的。”他喃喃自语，脚步带着他穿过一扇随意敞开的门。

"_Hmph, no way, not in a million years!" she declared, pitching her nose up in defiance._  
"哼，绝不可能，一百万年都不可能！" 她宣布道，傲然地扬起鼻子。

"We might just be that old." He chuckled to himself.  
"我们可能真的老了。" 他自嘲地笑了笑。

How old was he? 他到底多大了？

That was a good question.  
那是个好问题。

It wasn't like he ever got past 15 most of the time anyways. Though he had started out a bit older in some lives. Even if he took every life and averaged out to 8 months of living…  
反正他大多数时候也活不过 15 岁。尽管在某些生命中，他一开始年纪稍大些。即便他把每一生都加起来，平均算下来也只有 8 个月的寿命……

He was still pretty old.  
他依然算得上相当年长。

Though to do that it would mean he would have had to keep track of how many lives he had. That was a particular game he had given up or been forced to a long time ago.  
尽管要做到这一点，意味着他必须记录自己还剩下多少条命。那款游戏，他早已放弃或被迫搁置很久了。

Despite everything, he still thought of himself as a 14-year-old, a 14-year-old who hadn't had a birthday in a _very_ long time. One that knew things that no one should and having experienced things that people only saw in their nightmares.  
尽管经历了这一切，他仍自视为一个 14 岁的少年，一个很久没有过生日、知晓不该知晓之事、体验过人们噩梦中才有的经历的 14 岁少年。

And after all that he still felt like he was that 14-year-old waiting to be picked up by Misato.  
经历了这一切之后，他依然感觉自己像是那个 14 岁的孩子，等待着美里来接他。

Looking around to where his feet had taken him Shinji was rather surprised to find himself surround by instruments. Some storage closet perhaps?  
环顾四周，发现自己被乐器包围，真嗣颇感意外。或许是某个储物间？

Reaching down to stroke the strings on a guitar which had been left without a cover and outside a case, the boy sneezed as dust came flying off the metal coils.  
他伸手去拨弄一把裸露在外、未装盒的吉他的琴弦，随着金属弦上的灰尘飞扬，男孩打了个喷嚏。

No one had been apart this school's band for a long time.  
这所学校乐队的成员已经很久没有人来过了。

Which was strange because he could remember there being one before. He could even remember a nice quartet between himself, a German, a Clone, and…  
这很奇怪，因为他记得之前确实有过一次。他甚至记得自己、一个德国人、一个克隆人，还有……

Him… 他……

Had that actually happened? Or was it in some other life?  
那真的发生过吗？还是说，那是在另一个生命里？

"_You're gonna need to get back to class soon baka."_  
"你很快就得回教室了，笨蛋。"

_She was right like always.  
她总是对的。_

Looking around, Shinji found an empty case for the instrument and packed it up. He'd bring it back of course, just keeping it long enough to let his fingers remember how to play.  
环顾四周，真嗣找到了一个乐器的空箱子，把它收拾好。他当然会把它带回来，只是要留着它足够长的时间，让他的手指记住如何演奏。

It wasn't like anyone was using it here.  
这里又没人用它。

**Well, I said Monday -Tuesday didn't I? yeah, I couldn't keep away.  
嗯，我说的是周一到周二，对吧？是的，我忍不住又回来了。**

**Shoutouts! 致谢！**

**Greg242- Thanks! Hope you keep enjoying it!  
Greg242- 谢谢！希望你继续享受它！**

**dyinglittelstar- Well like I said, I've been working on the story for about a month and a half. So we got like 40-60k words already written.  
dyinglittelstar- 就像我之前说的，这个故事我已经写了大约一个半月了。所以我们已经有大约 4 万到 6 万字了。**

**Akomis- I'm always happy to make a morning!  
阿科米斯——我总是乐于迎接清晨的到来！**

**The most annoying thing about 2.0 is the pacing, it works for a movie, but damn does it suck when you bounce between a bunch of different scenes in under 5 minutes, or have what seems like the movie going through long stretches of time without really telling you.  
2.0 最让人头疼的地方就是节奏，作为电影它或许合适，但当你在不到五分钟内跳跃于多个场景之间，或是感觉电影在长时间跨度中匆匆掠过却未作详细交代时，真是让人抓狂。**

**Until Next Time 下次再见**

### Chapter 11: "…I'm breaking up inside…"  
Chapter 11: "…我内心正在崩溃…"

Standing in the locker-room and waiting to go into the testing chamber Shinji actually felt nervous.  
站在更衣室里，等待进入测试室，真嗣真的感到紧张。

And to think he used to love sync tests.  
想想他以前还挺喜欢同步率测试的。

When this all began, he loved trouncing Asuka. Each and every time, he relished in knowing how to push his percentage just one point higher to urk her.  
当这一切开始时，他喜欢碾压明日香。每一次，他都津津有味地知道如何将同步率提高一点，以此来激怒她。

He only had to do that a few times before he realized just how much it hurt her. How counter intuitive it had been to helping her through her pain.  
他只试了几次就意识到这有多伤她的心。这与他帮助她度过痛苦的初衷背道而驰。

Right now, he had a different problem.  
眼下，他面临着一个不同的问题。

Thinking back on the fight with the Sixth Angel, when he had called upon his AT Field, he had known something was off. He didn't have time to think about it then, but now that he was about to get back into an entry plug his mind couldn't help but ponder it, especially with how different this life had become.  
回想起与第六使徒的战斗，当他召唤出 AT 力场时，他就感觉到有些不对劲。那时他没有时间细想，但现在即将再次进入插入栓，他的思绪不由自主地回到了那个问题上，尤其是考虑到如今生活的巨大变化。

What if his EVA rejected him?  
如果他的 EVA 拒绝了他怎么办？

It was his mother, or at least should be his mother, so why was he worried?  
那是他的母亲，或者至少应该是他的母亲，但为何他会感到忧虑？

Well… it definitely didn't help when this life was suddenly making a sharp turn left. It would just be the thing to top it all off really.  
嗯……当这段人生突然急转直下时，这无疑无助于缓解他的焦虑。这简直就是雪上加霜。

Placing the cross around his neck as Shinji shrunk the plug suit around him, he smiled as it fit perfectly underneath the bulky white piece on his chest.  
将十字架挂于颈间，随着真嗣紧缩插头服，他微笑着发现它恰好贴合在胸前那件笨重的白色部件之下。

It was time. 是时候了。

ʡʘʘʢ

Misato looked at the three plugs half-way submerged in the LCL and took another sip of her coffee.  
美里看着三个半浸在 LCL 中的插入栓，又啜了一口咖啡。

Rits' coffee machine was still magic, especially when you had a hangover.  
律子的咖啡机依然神奇，尤其是当你宿醉的时候。

If she hadn't needed it today, she would have forgone it, but that dull throbbing in her skull demanded she sip the coffee even if it was the afternoon.  
如果今天不需要它，她本会放弃，但那隐隐作痛的头痛迫使她在下午也要啜饮咖啡。

"You'd think we'd have decent air conditioning in here" she bemoaned as she wiped away another bead of wet as it rolled down her forehead.  
“你会以为我们这里会有像样的空调。”她抱怨着，擦去又一颗顺着额头滚落的汗珠。

Despite the heat, her longtime friend hadn't even removed her lab coat, and sat perfectly fine at a terminal finishing the final checks for the test.  
尽管天气炎热，她的老朋友甚至没有脱下实验室外套，而是安然坐在终端前，完成测试的最后检查。

She looked around, it seemed that none of the lab rats had even taken notice of the heat, too engrained in their work and the noise of their machines.  
她环顾四周，似乎实验室里的老鼠们都没有注意到这股热浪，他们太过沉浸于工作，以及机器的嘈杂声中。

"It does, but a when we have a few million gallons of LCL and a good chunk of the total computing power on earth right next to us, there isn't a whole lot we can do." She quipped as her fingers danced along the keyboard.  
“确实如此，但当我们身边有几百万加仑的 LCL 和地球上一大部分计算能力时，我们能做的实在不多。”她打趣道，手指在键盘上飞舞。

The newly promoted Colonel wouldn't know anything about the worry in the blonde's mind, nor could she know that her friend had been _very_ close to calling off this test.  
新晋上校对金发女子心中的担忧一无所知，更不可能知道她的朋友曾一度考虑取消这次测试。

"Alright, we're going to begin now," Ritsuko told the pilots with as steady a voice she could muster. On one of the screens their three faces came up for Misato to watch "Just relax and do your best to concentrate."  
"好了，我们现在开始，" 律子用尽可能平稳的声音告诉驾驶员们。在其中一个屏幕上，他们的三张脸出现在美里眼前，"放松，尽力集中注意力。"

Rei had the same bland expression she always did, eyes closed doing her best to ready herself, or that was at least what Misato thought was happening. Sometimes she really didn't know what was going on inside that kid's head.  
丽一如既往地保持着平淡的表情，闭着眼睛，尽力让自己做好准备，至少美里是这么认为的。有时候，她真的不知道那孩子脑子里在想些什么。

"Are you ready to get trounced Third Child?" Asuka asked Shinji over comms.  
“准备好被揍一顿了吗，三儿？”明日香通过通讯器问真嗣。

Minato looked to Shinji's window, the boy had already closed his eyes, but popped them open just for Asuka's barb.  
美里望向真嗣的窗户，男孩已经闭上了眼睛，但为了明日香的嘲讽又睁开了。

"**[Sync rates aren't everything, ]** Roter Drache." He said with a touch of bravado.  
“[同步率并不是一切，] 红龙。”他带着一丝自傲说道。

Growling something in German, Asuka closed her eyes again, this time with a frown on her face.  
明日香用德语咕哝着什么，再次闭上眼睛，这次脸上带着皱眉。

Cutting her mic, Ritsuko looked back at Minato, eyebrows raised "I guess he does know German." She said incredibly.  
切断麦克风，律子回头看向渚薰，挑了挑眉，“我猜他确实懂德语。”她难以置信地说。

Misato just gave her a look of 'I told you so' and proceeded to turn the mics back on "Alright you two enough of that, let's get started."  
美里只是给了她一个‘我早告诉过你’的眼神，然后重新打开麦克风，“好了，你们俩，别闹了，我们开始吧。”

Commands fluttered throughout the room, numbers were rattled off in quick succession, scientific names and terms flew at her but Misato could care less.  
指令在房间里四处飘荡，数字被迅速报出，科学名词和术语向她袭来，但美里并不在意。

She watched the faces of the children…  
她注视着孩子们的脸庞……

_Her Children… 她的孩子们……_

That was unprofessional, she knew that. She knew that she should be keeping them at arm's length if only for appearance's sake and three months ago she would have done just that.  
她知道那样做不专业。她明白自己应该保持距离，哪怕只是为了表面上的得体，三个月前她肯定会这么做。

But Shinji's…. incident had caused her to latch onto the child, more for herself than him she had to admit.  
但真嗣的那次……事件，让她不由自主地依赖起这个孩子，她不得不承认，更多的是为了自己而非他。

The woman had let down her barrier for him, whether it was because she wanted to, or it was out of a sense of guilt she really didn't know.  
那女人为他放下了心防，无论是出于自愿，还是因为她自己也说不清的内疚感。

Asuka… well, she had looked after the girl in Germany for about a year. That had been a long time ago, when the fiery redhead had been around the age of 10.  
明日香……嗯，她在德国照顾那个女孩大约有一年时间。那是很久以前的事了，当时那个火红的红发女孩大约 10 岁。

Despite the time, she didn't feel as close to her as Shinji, perhaps it was because the girl had made sure to distance herself at the same time.  
尽管如此，她对明日香的感觉并不像对真嗣那样亲近，或许是因为那女孩同时也在刻意保持距离。

Three peas in a pod if she said so herself.  
她自己都说，这三个人简直像一锅里的三颗豆子。

Shinji had at least seemed to accept Misato's affection, he had allowed her to grow closer without pulling back, even when the woman felt she might just be too overbearing. He had simply smiled at those times and at her apologies, he had let her squeeze him in her drunken embrace every now and again even if she just did it to make sure he was alive.  
至少，真嗣似乎接受了美里姐的关爱，他允许她越来越亲近，即便有时她觉得自己可能过于强势，他也没有退缩。每当这种时候，他只是微笑着接受她的道歉，偶尔还会让她在醉意中紧紧拥抱他，尽管她这么做只是为了确认他还活着。

Taking another sip of her coffee, the Colonel had to keep the liquid from being ejected at a lethal velocity with her hands as alarms sounded and the control room flooded with panic.  
上校又啜了一口咖啡，随着警报声响起，控制室陷入一片慌乱，她不得不用手控制住咖啡，以免它以致命的速度喷射出来。

ʡʘʘʢ

The Third Children held his eyes closed as he let his consciousness meld into the link.  
第三适格者闭着眼睛，任由自己的意识融入连接之中。

Sync tests could be much more intimate connections with the Evangelions if you knew what you were doing and unfortunately, he had _plenty_ of time to figure that out.  
如果你知道自己在做什么，同步测试可能会与 EVA 建立更为亲密的联系，不幸的是，他有足够的时间来弄清楚这一点。

Barreling towards him was the other half of the link, the consciousness within the EVA which presumably was his mother washed over him, only for the expectation of said being to be crushed.  
另一个连接的半身，即 EVA 内的意识，本应是他母亲的意识，向他涌来，却随即粉碎了对此存在的期待。

He didn't make any sudden 'movements' with the other entity, he just let them react, let them examine. If he didn't do this now, if he didn't let them realize that he was not the same Shinji Ikari as the one before, the problem would probably rear its ugly head at the most inopportune time.  
他没有对另一个实体做出任何突然的‘动作’，只是任由他们反应，任由他们观察。如果他现在不这么做，如果不让他们意识到他已非昔日之碇真嗣，问题很可能会在最不合时宜的时刻爆发。

That was just his luck.  
这就是他的运气。

So, there they were, watching him with a lazy curiosity, like he was some new item that they had never seen before. He certainly 'looked' the same on the outside, but…  
于是，他们就这样，带着一种慵懒的好奇心打量着他，仿佛他是一件从未见过的崭新物品。他的外表确实‘看起来’一模一样，但是…

It searched him, it reached inside, where it only found a barrier that they couldn't break, there was only one who could.  
它探寻着他，深入其内，却只发现了一道他们无法打破的屏障，唯有一个人能够做到。

Now it was time to reach back out to it.  
现在，是时候重新与之接触了。

_Mother… 母亲…_

Like the slightest brush of hands, they met, only for the instant contact was made, unfortunately for him, the presence recoiled.  
宛如轻触指尖，他们相遇，仅一瞬的接触便已发生，遗憾的是，他感到一股退缩的气息。

_Despair 绝望_

_Sadness 悲伤_

_Hatred 憎恨_

_Anger 愤怒_

_Loathing 憎恶_

_Rage 狂怒_

_._

_._

_._

_Pain 痛苦_

All those feelings he had forced down inside of him came roaring back to the surface. How had those things escaped? And why did it feel like there was more than just the two of them all of a sudden?  
那些他曾强行压抑在心底的情感，此刻如洪水猛兽般汹涌而出。这些情感是如何逃脱的？为何突然间感觉不止他们两人在场？

How could one little brush with his mother bring that gushing back up again, when he had done this so many times before?  
为何仅仅是一次与母亲的短暂接触，就能让这些情感再次喷涌而出，尽管他之前已经历过无数次？

"Shinji just what the hell is going on in there?" Misato called over the comms.  
“真嗣，里面到底发生了什么？”美里通过通讯器喊道。

"Just give me a second." He growled, doing his best to coax whatever it was back to him.  
"就给我一点时间。" 他咆哮着，尽力把那东西引回自己身边。

"Neural feedback is going haywire, cut the connection!" Ritsuko yelled, he hated that blonde.  
"神经反馈乱套了，切断连接！" 律子喊道，他讨厌那个金发女人。

"No!" Shinji yelled through the comms, "I've got this."  
"不行！" 真嗣通过通讯器大喊，"我能搞定。"

He forced everything back down, like trying to stuff more clothes into a bag that was simply too small, all the while he reached back out to the retreating presence that had seemingly got a glimpse of him.  
他强行将一切压回心底，就像试图将更多衣物塞进一个实在太小的包里，与此同时，他再次伸出手去触碰那个似乎瞥见了他、正逐渐退去的身影。

Too good a glimpse. 瞥得太清楚了。

Yui, please… 唯，请……

It stopped, just like that at his call, and it hesitated. Was it scared of him? Slowly it came back to him, hesitation was the nicest word he had, it didn't bother to hide its desire not to sync with this alien person.  
它应声而止，犹豫不决。是害怕他吗？它缓缓地向他靠近，犹豫已是最好的形容词，它毫不掩饰自己不愿与这个异类同步的欲望。

They connected again, this time he held back, making sure to only think about how he had connected with it during the Sixth Angel's attack.  
他们再次连接，这次他有所保留，确保只思考在第六使徒攻击时与它连接的情景。

The sudden realization was felt by both sides, with his EVA's consciousness rushing forwards, enveloping him as it realized this was the same person who had piloted it before.  
双方都突然意识到，他的 EVA 意识向前涌动，包裹着他，意识到这是曾经驾驶过它的同一个人。

He was still unsure what exactly to make of his 'partner' though.  
尽管如此，他仍不确定该如何看待他的这位“搭档”。

"Barrier reached on all three." The words brought him back to him surroundings "Stable synchronization on all three pilots.'  
“三重屏障已就位。”这句话将他拉回了现实，“三位驾驶员同步稳定。”

He made sure his breath was steady now, he could bend, but he would not break.  
他确保自己的呼吸平稳，他能屈能伸，但绝不会崩溃。

This life was too good for him to do that.  
这生活对他来说太好了，以至于他无法做出那种事。

He concentrated, working to keep his score steady.  
他集中精神，努力保持分数稳定。

There would be no massive scores for him today, he wasn't sure if he'd ever be able to do that with this Unit-01, and he was worried that he'd never find out why.  
今天他不会有巨大的分数了，他不确信自己是否能用这台初号机做到，他担心自己永远也找不到原因。

ʡʘʘʢ

For a moment she just breathed, and watched the numbers on the screen, what the hell was that?  
有那么一会儿，她只是呼吸着，注视着屏幕上的数字，那到底是什么鬼东西？

Rei, stable as always hovered in the 40s, it was nothing new, despite her incident in Unit-00, she had stayed stable, it was good enough for her.  
丽一如既往地稳定，数值徘徊在 40 左右，这并不新鲜，尽管她在零号机事件中遭遇了意外，但她一直保持稳定，这对她来说已经足够好了。

The thought of that incident made her head spin, it felt as if it was so long ago  
想到那次事件，她的头就开始发晕，感觉仿佛已经过去很久了

She turned her head now to the self-proclaimed _Ubermench_ of Germany.  
她此刻转头看向那位自称德国超人的人。

58.7%.

It was lower than her score when she was in Germany, a whole five percent lower.  
这比她在德国时的分数还要低，整整低了五个百分点。

"What the!?" “什么鬼？！”

Her attention snapped to Risuko, who was looking at her terminal with her mouth wide open.  
她的注意力立刻转向了 Risuko，只见她正目瞪口呆地盯着终端屏幕。

No alarms sounded, no one shouted, even with everyone on high alert from the last bit of excitement no one knew what she was so exacerbated by.  
没有警报响起，没有人呼喊，尽管大家因最近的一阵兴奋而高度戒备，却无人知晓她为何如此恼怒。

"What's up Rits?" she asked casually walking over to her, doing the best to get rid of the adrenaline-fueled shakes she now had.  
“怎么了，Rits？”她随意地走过去，尽力平复此刻因肾上腺素激增而颤抖的身体。

The blonde was pail, or at least more than usual, with wide eyes staring at her screen, Misato looked down at it, it was simply Shinji's sync rate, 53.2%.  
金发女子脸色苍白，或者比平时更甚，她瞪大了眼睛盯着屏幕，美里低头一看，那只是真嗣的同步率，53.2%。

"You alright?" Misato asked, the doctor was frozen, just looking at her screen.  
“你还好吗？”美里问道，医生僵住了，只是盯着她的屏幕。

"What, come on Rits what's up?"  
“怎么了，来吧，律子，出什么事了？”

"You didn't see it?" she asked, after a moment. Her voice was shaky, unnatural.  
"你没看见吗？" 她片刻后问道，声音颤抖，不自然。

"What?" Misato asked, becoming more confused every second.  
"什么？" 美里问，每秒钟都变得更加困惑。

"Seriously? No one saw that?" Ritsuko just looked at her, Misato didn't think she'd ever seen her friend so… unnerved.  
"真的吗？没人看见那个？" 律子只是看着她，美里觉得她从未见过她的朋友如此……不安。

"Pull up the recordings!" The blonde barked at one of the techs, who silently obeyed, bringing up to the main screen a chart showing the recorded sync rate of one Shinji Ikari.  
“调出记录！”金发女子厉声命令一名技术人员，后者默默遵从，将一份显示碇真嗣同步率记录的图表呈现在主屏幕上。

"Oh…" "哦…"

She knew there was a delay before the recording or sync rates, just so the pilots could stabilize, but what she was seeing didn't make any sense.  
她知道录音或同步速率会有延迟，以便飞行员稳定下来，但她所看到的毫无意义。

"It was on my screen for longer than that." Ritsuko breathed out looking at the very beginning.  
"它在我的屏幕上停留的时间比那更长。" 赤木律子呼出一口气，目光投向最开始的部分。

"We must have gotten just a snippet at the end."  
"我们看到的只是最后的一小段。"

There, a lone sliver of a pillar on the chart showed a reading of 122.3%.  
在那儿，图表上孤零零的一小条柱显示读数为 122.3%。

That explains it. 这就解释得通了。

"What does that even mean, could it be a faulty reading?" Misato asked eyeing the blonde who shook her head.  
"那是什么意思，会不会是读数错误？" 美里看着金发女子，后者摇了摇头。

"With no alarms and the two other pilots not being affected, unlikely."  
"没有警报，另外两位驾驶员也没有受到影响，不太可能。"

Misato's eyes turned back to the dark-haired child submerged in LCL. He had gone from a critically low to a high she knew hadn't been reached before.  
美里的目光转回到浸泡在 LCL 中的黑发孩子身上。他的数值从危急的低值飙升到了一个她从未见过的峰值。

What was that Shinji? 什么情况，真嗣？

ʡʘʘʢ

The Third Children just sat in the locker room, soaking wet from his shower and completely uninterested in getting dressed to leave.  
第三适格者只是坐在更衣室里，刚洗完澡浑身湿漉漉的，对换衣服离开完全提不起兴趣。

"_Well, that went well." Soryu mused as she laid on top of the lockers, seemingly doing her best to entertain herself._  
“嗯，进展得不错。”惣流躺在储物柜顶上自言自语，似乎正尽力让自己不无聊。

"Don't make it worse." He mumbled while running his thumb over his pendent.  
"别再添乱了。" 他咕哝着，用拇指摩挲着吊坠。

"There's something different about her, it's like she's more… tangled with Unit-01."  
"她有些不同，好像和初号机更加……纠缠不清了。"

"_Pfft, maybe you're just losing your touch!" She jumped off the lockers and landed in front of him, hands on her hips, the girl just leaned down, peering at his with that one eye._  
"哼，也许是你技艺生疏了吧！" 她从储物柜上跳下，落在他面前，双手叉腰，女孩俯下身，用那只眼睛盯着他。

"_Baka Shinji's finally cracking up, after all this time!"_  
"笨蛋真嗣终于崩溃了，这么长时间了！"

He just glared at her and shook his head; he really shouldn't be talking with her. She wasn't even real.  
他只是瞪了她一眼，摇了摇头；他真的不应该和她说话。她甚至不是真实的。

_"That's not true!" "那不是真的！"_

ʡʘʘʢ

Hovering only a few hundred feet over the moon's surface would be considered a massive feat of technical engineering for the human race.  
悬停于月球表面仅数百英尺之上，对人类而言堪称一项巨大的技术工程壮举。

But watching the construction of the massive humanoid below seemed to put Kozo's current position into perspective.  
但看着下方巨大人形机体的建造过程，似乎让 Kozo 目前的处境变得明朗起来。

"They're clearly using a new method of construction for the Mark 6," Gendo mused, while the older man just watched out the window in silence.  
“他们显然在为 Mark 6 采用一种新的建造方法，”Gendo 沉思着，而那位年长者只是默默地望着窗外。

"for all we know there could be further undisclosed apocrypha, SEELE is intent to follow the scripture of the Dead Sea Scrolls."  
“据我们所知，可能还有更多未公开的秘典，SEELE 执意要遵循死海古卷的教义。”

The elderly professor turned to his younger college, eyeing his stoic face as he peered out the window at the lunar surface and craft that floated about over the Evangelions construction site.  
老教授转向他的年轻同事，目光停留在他那张凝视窗外月球表面和漂浮在福音战士建造现场上空的飞船时显得冷漠的脸庞上。

"SEELE can't be oblivious to our plans and it's likely they know what happened to your son."  
SEELE 不可能对我们的计划一无所知，他们很可能知道你儿子发生了什么。

As a shadow passed over them due to other construction craft, Gendo said nothing.  
当另一艘建造飞船的阴影掠过他们时，碇源堂一言不发。

"They most likely are aware, but that can't let that alter our plans… as for Shinji…"  
"他们很可能已经知晓，但这不能改变我们的计划……至于真嗣……"

He stopped; his attention drawn to the surface below them.  
他停了下来；注意力被下方的地面吸引。

Even with his aging eyes Kozo could see it as well, that pale figure standing on the surface.  
即便是在他老化的眼睛里，也能看到那个站在地面上的苍白身影。

"A person, surely not." “一个人，当然不是。”

In front of him, a row of what looked like coffins laid there, some open, some still closed, but the figure just had his arms crossed before looking up at them.  
在他面前，一排看起来像棺材的东西摆在那里，有的敞开着，有的还紧闭着，但那身影只是双臂交叉，抬头看向他们。

His eyesight was pinpoint, and the sub-commander had the feeling that whoever it was down there knew they were being watched.  
他的视力极为敏锐，副指挥官有种感觉，下面那个人知道他们正在观察他。

On the surface, those red eyes just peered up at the drifting craft.  
表面上，那双红眸只是凝视着飘荡的小船。

Letting the ends of his lips curl, Kaworu Nagisa kept himself from waving to the craft, it was a silly idea after all.  
让嘴角微微上扬，渚薰忍住了向飞船挥手的冲动，毕竟那想法实在有些幼稚。

But that didn't stop him from talking in the vacuum of space either.  
但这并未阻止他在太空的真空环境中继续交谈。

"Nice to meet you… _Father_."  
“很高兴见到你……父亲。”

**Alright, who's ready for a fieldtrip?  
好了，谁准备好去实地考察了？**

**Shoutouts! 致谢！**

**UltraSpink of Da USA- Thank! And yes I'm not Anno after all of course we'll get there! *insert Mr. Incredible 'we get there when we get there' meme here*  
美利坚超旋风- 谢谢！当然，我不是碇司令，我们肯定会到达的！*插入《超人总动员》里的‘我们到那儿就到那儿’表情包***

**Akomis- You're very welcome! I don't know if it's such a darker take as a more… realistic one? I see a lot of stories where Shinji goes back and he doesn't have near crippling levels of psychological issues, which they're great don't get me wrong, but I'm pretty sure no one got out of EOE without at least some trauma, least of all** _**Shinji**_**. Add in the fact that he's been essentially put into the 'cosmic equivalent of a washing machine spin cycle'** **tm** **for god only knows how long… well here we are, just like we saw in this chapter he hasn't exactly had a therapist to talk to about this stuff, it's just kinda been building up… waiting to break the camel's back I wonder? In a way I want him to be both the protagonist and the biggest hurdle in his way, because he's got the knowledge and skill, sure, but does he have the will to go through all this one more time?**  
Akomis- 不用谢！我不确定这是否是一个更黑暗的视角，还是更像一个……现实的视角？我看到很多故事里，真嗣回去后并没有接近致残的心理问题，这些故事很棒，别误会，但我很确定没人能从《真心为你》中毫发无损地走出来，更不用说真嗣了。再加上他被扔进了‘宇宙级别的洗衣机甩干模式’里，天知道有多久……好吧，我们在这里，就像我们在《1001 夜》里看到的，他并没有心理医生可以倾诉这些，这些压力只是不断积累……等待着压垮骆驼的最后一根稻草，我在想？在某种程度上，我希望他既是主角，也是他最大的障碍，因为他有知识和技能，当然，但他是否有再次经历这一切的意志呢？

**A fun fact I learned in psychology is that when people are exposed to their fear they don't get** _**less afraid**_**, because the fear doesn't become less real to them, but they instead become** _**braver**_**. Like Asuka said back in Chapter 4, deep down Shinji is still that scared shitless kid he's always been, he's just been through hell… multiple times… alright, pretty much constantly. Did I really just write a 200-word response to that? (The two Asukas? Very interesting indeed.)**  
我在心理学中学到的一个有趣事实是，当人们面对自己的恐惧时，他们并不会因此变得更不害怕，因为恐惧对他们来说并没有变得不那么真实，而是他们变得更勇敢了。就像 Asuka 在Chapter 4 中说的那样，Shinji 内心深处仍然是那个一直害怕得要命的孩子，只是他经历了地狱般的磨难……多次……好吧，几乎是一直如此。我真的刚刚写了一个 200 字的回复吗？（两个 Asuka？确实非常有趣。）

**A Guy- Yeah, I've been having a blast with this one, here's to hopefully not getting writers block anytime soon. *nocks on wood*  
某人——是的，我一直在享受这个过程，希望不久的将来不会遇到写作障碍。*敲木头祈求好运***

**Until Next Time. 下次再会。**

### Chapter 12: "…I spoke into his eyes…"  
Chapter 12: "…我对着他的眼睛说道…"

A field trip? With Kaji?  
一次实地考察？和加持一起？

Shinji smiled; this was going to be good.  
真嗣笑了；这将会很有趣。

"Kaji, who's Kaji?" “加持，谁是加持？”

"Mhmm, you haven't met him yet," Misato mumbled from behind her beer, finishing it she tossed the can behind her, "but he'll take care of you, even if he is a rat bastard."  
“嗯，你还没见过他，”美里从啤酒后面咕哝着，喝完后她把罐子扔到身后，“但他会照顾你的，即使他是个混蛋。”

"and he said you could bring anyone you want."  
"他说你可以带任何你想带的人。"

"Will you be coming with us Misato?" Shinji knew the two adults might just need an extra push to get them back together, perhaps if he managed to get them closer sooner Kaji might just make it through this.  
"美里小姐，你会和我们一起去吗？" 真嗣知道这两位成年人可能需要一点额外的推动才能让他们重归于好，也许如果他能让他们更快地接近，加持也许就能挺过这一关。

Then again, he still wasn't certain Misato didn't know about NERV's true purpose yet, but he was willing to take that chance.  
不过话说回来，他仍然不确定美里是否已经知道 NERV 的真正目的，但他愿意冒这个险。

She just shook her head "I've don't have time to go off on field trips like that man, some of us have to work you know."  
她只是摇了摇头，“我可没时间像那家伙一样到处跑，我们有些人还得工作，你懂的。”

"Cool than I'll just hang out with you." Asuka called from the other room.  
“酷，那我就跟你一起待着。”明日香从另一个房间喊道。

"Nope, you two are still supposed to be harmonizing, so you're sticking with Shinji."  
“不行，你们俩还得继续协调，所以你得和真嗣一起。”

The German peered out from behind a doorway "Is that another order?" she asked, her WonderSwan clutched in her hands, venom in her voice.  
德国女孩从门后探出头来，“那是另一个命令吗？”她问道，手中的 WonderSwan 紧握，语气中带着毒意。

Shinji smiled at the interaction between the two and just continued to clean up after dinner while the two of them fought. Well, Asuka fought, Misato just stayed cool and unmoving in her decision.  
真嗣对两人的互动微微一笑，继续在晚餐后收拾着，而她们俩则争吵不休。好吧，是明日香在争吵，美里只是冷静且坚定地保持她的决定。

A twist in his chest reminded him how much nostalgia this brought to him, how much he missed this.  
胸口的一阵扭痛提醒了他，这一切带给他多少怀旧之情，他有多么怀念这种感觉。

Even if it was strange that Asuka didn't want to go on a field trip, he remembered how much she had raged against the fact that she was forced to stay back from their class trip.  
尽管明日香不想参加实地考察旅行显得有些奇怪，但他记得她曾多么愤怒地抗议被迫留在家里，无法参加班级的旅行。

Things could be stranger.  
事情可能会更奇怪。

ʡʘʘʢ

Asuka laid there, unable to sleep, that small screen of her game the only light from inside her room while the rest was just barely visible by the light coming through her window.  
明日香躺在那里，无法入睡，游戏机的小屏幕是她房间里唯一的光源，而其余部分仅能勉强透过窗户的光线隐约可见。

A part of her had hoped that she would escape those memories after she left Germany, the change in scenery finally freeing her of the cold at night, but it had been weeks now.  
她曾希望离开德国后能摆脱那些记忆，换个环境终于能让她夜里不再感到寒冷，但如今已过去数周。

So much for that bit of hope.  
那份希望终究落空了。

Now she just laid there, unable to close her eyes, yet too tired to really do anything, not even her handheld appealed to her.  
现在她只是躺在那里，无法闭上眼睛，却又疲惫得什么也做不了，甚至连掌机也提不起她的兴趣。

She heard a door slide open or whatever the Japanese considered these thin and flimsy walls that slid.  
她听到一扇门滑开的声音，或者说是日本人认为的这种薄而脆弱的滑动墙壁。

Then… slowly… hers opened. At first, she did nothing, completely and utterly confused by the situation.  
然后……慢慢地……她的门也开了。起初，她什么也没做，完全彻底地被这情况搞糊涂了。

Turning over, she saw the Third Child just standing there, his head drooped down, slowly walking into her room, not bothering to look at her, just… slowly shuffling forward.  
她翻身一看，只见第三适格者就站在那里，头低垂着，缓缓走进她的房间，没有看她，只是……慢慢地向前挪动。

The redhead's mind drifted back to Misato warning her that the Third Child was prone to sleepwalking, and how her guardian had seemed intent about her avoiding startling or stopping him.  
红发少女的思绪飘回了美里警告她，第三适格者有梦游的习惯，以及她的监护人似乎非常坚决地要她避免惊动或阻止他。

Then again… _he_ was in _her_ room.  
不过话说回来……他现在就在她的房间里。

What's the worst he could do?  
他还能做出什么最糟糕的事呢？

He had made it very slowly the foot of her bed, his side towards her, when she gently swung her legs over the far side and tiptoed in front of him.  
他缓缓地挪到她床脚，背对着她，而她则轻柔地将双腿移向另一侧，踮着脚尖从他面前悄悄走过。

She couldn't see his eyes; his hair covered the direct line of sight. His shoulders where slouched, like he had resigned himself to some terrible fate.  
她看不见他的眼睛，他的头发遮挡了直接的视线。他的肩膀耷拉着，仿佛已经屈从于某种可怕的命运。

He actually looked quite pathetic compared to the typical boy she had come to know, the one that never seemed to bat and eye at her insults, and more annoyingly would never seem to leave her alone either.  
与他平日里所熟知的那个男孩相比，他此刻显得颇为可怜，那个男孩从不因她的嘲讽而动摇，更恼人的是，也从不曾离她而去。

Perhaps this had to do with his sync test the other day? Despite her inability to hear the back and forth between Ritsuko and the boy, afterwards she was sure something had happened, judging by Misato's face alone.  
或许这与前几天他的同步测试有关？尽管她无法听到律子和少年之间的对话，但事后从美里脸上的表情判断，她确信发生了什么。

Finally, creeping closer, she leaned in, "Shinji?" she whispered.  
最终，她悄悄靠近，倾身向前，“真嗣？”她低声唤道。

Faster than she could react his arms shot up. His head was still lowered but his hands had found themselves clamped around her neck.  
他的手臂迅速抬起，快到她来不及反应。他的头依旧低垂，但双手已经紧紧掐住了她的脖子。

It took her brain a half a second to realize she could still breathe.  
她的脑子花了半秒钟才意识到自己还能呼吸。

The Second Child was frozen, doing her best to keep herself from yelling and cursing to wake Misato. Her mind had to keep reminding her that even though his hands were around her neck they weren't actually squeezing.  
第二适格者僵立着，竭力克制自己不尖叫或咒骂以唤醒美里。她的内心不断提醒自己，尽管他的双手环绕在她的脖子上，但实际上并没有用力挤压。

He wasn't actually hurting her.  
他并没有真的在伤害她。

Yet. 然而。

Asuka had never felt like this, the feeling that a situation could teeter on the edge of some cavern, she knew one wrong move and everything could come crashing down, so she did nothing.  
明日香从未有过这样的感觉，仿佛处境悬于深渊边缘，她深知一步错便会全盘倾覆，因此她选择静观其变。

They stood there for minutes, his hands still lightly clasping he neck, and her frozen, unable to bring herself to say anything.  
他们就这样僵持了几分钟，他的双手依旧轻抚着她的脖颈，而她则僵立原地，无法开口说出一个字。

She could feel her heart pounding in her chest, and the arteries in her neck pumping against his palms.  
她能感觉到自己的心脏在胸腔中剧烈跳动，颈部的动脉在他的手掌下搏动。

Then, the whimper. 接着，是那声呜咽。

It was coming from the Third Child, it was light, but she could still hear the tearless sobbing noises he made.  
声音来自第三适格者，虽然轻微，但她仍能听到他那无泪的抽泣声。

What was this? 这是什么？

What was she supposed to do in this situation? There was no training for this, no field exercise she could have gone through, no manual she could think back on. What was she supposed to do?  
在这种情况下她该怎么办？没有针对这种情况的训练，没有可以经历的野外演习，也没有可以回想的指南手册。她到底该怎么做？

"Please stop Shinji." She whispered to him.  
“请停下，真嗣。”她轻声对他说。

That was pathetic. Why did she ask that, and so meekly? A feeling? Gut instinct? Whatever it was, it felt… right.  
那真是可悲。她为何要如此怯懦地问出口？是一种感觉？直觉？无论是什么，它感觉……是对的。

Surprisingly, he ever so slowly let his hands go from her neck and just stood there. Then… he turned to leave through the door.  
出乎意料的是，他极其缓慢地松开了放在她脖子上的手，只是站在那里。然后……他转身从门口离开了。

As she watched him leave her hands went up and rubbed where his had only just rested. The warmth was still there from his palms.  
她目送他离去，双手不由自主地抚上他刚刚触碰过的地方。他的手掌留下的温暖依旧存在。

She watched as the sleepwalker slowly went back through the door he had come through, closing it.  
她看着梦游者缓缓地穿过他进来的那扇门，然后关上了它。

Once again, leaving more questions than answers.  
又一次，留下的问题比答案还多。

ʡʘʘʢ

At first Toji had objected to the idea of Hikari coming along. He knew exactly what the Third Children was doing, and Shinji was pretty sure Hikari was sure about it as well.  
起初，真嗣反对光一起来的想法。他清楚第三适格者正在做什么，而真嗣确信光也心知肚明。

Not that she complained, she was the one who obviously liked the jock.  
她倒也没抱怨，毕竟她显然是对那个运动员有好感。

If she was trying to keep her crush on the boy secret, then the girl had done a spectacular job keeping Toji oblivious, everyone else, not so much.  
如果她试图隐藏对那个男孩的暗恋，那么她确实做得很好，让东治一直蒙在鼓里，其他人可就没那么容易被糊弄过去了。

Besides, if that plan failed maybe she could bond with Asuka like she had before.  
再者，如果那个计划失败了，也许她还能像以前那样和明日香建立联系。

Looking down at his feet, Pen Pen had been surprisingly easy to deal with so far.  
低头看着自己的脚，Pen Pen 到目前为止出乎意料地容易相处。

Somehow Misato had forced them to take the penguin at the last minute, Shinji figured the bird would appreciate an aquarium. If he didn't spend all his time trying to eat the fish.  
不知怎么的，美里在最后一刻逼他们带上了那只企鹅，真嗣猜想这鸟儿会喜欢水族馆的。只要它不整天想着吃鱼。

The group had been standing there in front of those doors, waiting for Misato's ex to let them in. Judging by Asuka's posture it had been a bit too long of a wait.  
这群人一直站在那扇门前，等待着美里前男友的允许进入。从明日香站姿来看，等待的时间似乎有些过长了。

"Alright kids, gets more complicated from here." He called out through a speaker, while waving through a window next to the door.  
“好了，孩子们，从这里开始会变得更复杂。”他通过扬声器喊道，同时从门旁的窗户挥手示意。

Shinji had left the familiar cross back in the apartment for the fear that something like this might happen.  
真嗣把那熟悉的十字架留在了公寓里，担心可能会发生类似的事情。

All of them had been stripped down to their underwear and were currently standing in an empty chamber awaiting 'decontamination'. The girls glaring daggers at his friends who were doing their best to advert their wandering eyes.  
他们都被脱得只剩内衣，此刻正站在一间空荡的房间里等待“消毒”。女孩们怒目而视，而他的朋友们则尽力避开四处游移的目光。

"_Taking a peek again? Oh, you're just_ spoiled _this time."_  
又偷看一眼？哦，这次你可真是被宠坏了。

_She just leaned against the wall away from them all and watched the group with a death glare.  
她只是远远地靠在墙边，用一种死亡凝视盯着那群人。_

Then the shower started, a scolding spray of pressurized water shot out at the group. He would have watched with a smile as all his friends ran around yelling about the heat, it wasn't pleasant for him either, but what was the easy part.  
随后淋浴开始，一股滚烫的高压水流喷向人群。他本可以微笑着看朋友们四处奔逃，大喊着抱怨水温，对他来说也不好受，但这只是轻松的部分。

The hard part was how it brought back memories.  
最难的是它唤起了回忆。

_He was back on the slopes of that volcano, Sandalphon had made it to the surface despite Asuka's best efforts, now Unit-01 was being doused in magma.  
他又回到了那座火山的斜坡上，尽管明日香竭尽全力，桑达尔丰还是到达了地面，现在零一机正被岩浆浇灌。_

_The Angels lunged at him as lava exploded through the slopes of the volcano, the whole mountain was starting to erupt.  
天使们向他扑来，火山斜坡上的熔岩炸裂开来，整座山开始喷发。_

Next the room seemed to fill with water, each of them floated around aimlessly while holding their breath. Rei seemed the most comfortable out of all of them, definitely due to her long sessions submerged in LCL.  
接着房间似乎充满了水，他们每个人都无目的地漂浮着，屏住呼吸。丽似乎是所有人中最自在的，这无疑得益于她长时间浸泡在 LCL 中的经历。

For him… 对他来说…

_He tried to free himself from the Angel, as it pushed him further down into the depths. He heard the armor creaking and groaning from the rapidly increasing pressure. There was no chance for him to get back to the surface this time.  
他试图从使徒的束缚中挣脱，但使徒将他推向更深处。他听到装甲因迅速增加的压力而吱吱作响。这次他已无望返回水面。_

_At least Asuka wasn't with him, she would survive.  
至少明日香没和他在一起，她会活下来的。_

A cold spray was soon upon them, even Pen Pen was finally being affected by the routine, being a warm water penguin and all.  
寒冷的喷雾很快笼罩了他们，就连 Pen Pen 也终于受到了日常的影响，毕竟它是一只温水企鹅。

_He dragged an unconscious Rei behind him on a makeshift sled through the blizzard. Pulling his coat around him closer. the Third Children was sure he was lost, the best thing to do now was look for shelter before they froze to death.  
他拖着昏迷的绫波在暴风雪中用临时制作的雪橇前行。他将外套紧紧裹在身上，第三适格者确信自己迷路了，现在最好的办法是寻找庇护所，以免他们冻死。_

_Hell of a way to see snow for the first time.  
第一次见雪竟是这种方式，真是地狱般的体验。_

"_C'mon Rei, you got me into this, even if you don't really know it, help me out here." That was half for his own sanity and to keep him from collapsing into the snow._  
"来吧，丽，虽然你并不知情，但毕竟是你把我卷进来的，帮帮我吧。" 这半是为了保持自己的理智，也为了防止自己倒在雪地里。

Another round of being submerged…  
又一轮的沉没……

_His LCL filtration system was starting to fail, it was getting harder and harder to breath, he was sure of it. His vision was starting to darken at its edges. Why hadn't he made it out of Leliel this time?  
他的 LCL 过滤系统开始失效，呼吸变得越来越困难，他确信这一点。视野边缘也开始变暗。为什么这次他没有从雷利尔中逃出来？_

Next, they had to endure what felt like a wind tunnel at full blast, with each teen did their best trying to keep from being knocked down. Hikari had taken the opportunity to hold onto Toji for support, who had spending just as much time blushing as trying to keep himself on his feet.  
接下来，他们不得不忍受着仿佛全速风洞般的强风，每个少年都尽力不让自己被吹倒。光抓住机会扶住了真嗣以寻求支撑，而真嗣则一边努力保持平衡，一边脸红得几乎和站稳脚跟一样频繁。

_Shinji dug his foot into the earth as the shockwave hit him. He watched Unit-02 have to fight Zeruel alone. His mind raced, he had to do something, anything!  
真嗣将脚深深踩进地面，以抵御冲击波。他看着 2 号机独自对抗零号使徒。他的思绪飞速运转，他必须做点什么，任何事！_

_But he wasn't even a pilot here.  
但他在这里甚至不是一名飞行员。_

A final round of sterile water.  
最后一轮无菌水。

_He was drowning, choaking on water while he clawed at the glass. The blonde doctor just looked at him in mild fascination from the other side. He couldn't get out of this tank, no matter what he did.  
他在溺水，窒息中抓着玻璃。金发医生只是从另一边带着些许好奇地看着他。无论他怎么做，都无法从这个水箱中逃脱。_

_He'd kill that bitch one day.  
他总有一天要干掉那个婊子。_

As the water drained, they all just collapsed, too exhausted to do much more than suck air into their lungs. Looking over his friends he smiled at the sight of Hikari still holding onto Toji, while the boy was doing his best to convince her that she could let go now.  
随着水流排尽，他们全都瘫倒在地，精疲力尽到只能大口吸气。环视朋友们，他看到光依然紧抱着真嗣，而真嗣正努力说服她现在可以放手了，这一幕让他微笑起来。

After they had picked themselves up, each of them was handed in what at best could be described as scrubs, while they waited to be let through the final door.  
他们各自起身，每人被递上了一套勉强能称之为病号服的衣物，然后等待着通过最后一道门。

A rather insulting microwave-like ding announced their entrance as the doors slid open to reveal an amazing sight.  
一道颇具侮辱性的微波炉提示音宣告了他们的进入，随着门滑开，眼前展现出一幅令人惊叹的景象。

In front of the group a gargantuan tank shot out before them, sea creatures swam in a massive collection of mystical moves to each of his friend's awe.  
在众人面前，一只巨大的坦克冲出，海中生物以一系列神秘的动作游弋，令每位朋友都惊叹不已。

Toji and Kensuke both exploded into childish glee, exclaiming their awe at the mass collection of sea life. Hikari just giggled at the two while letting her eyes follow the exotic creatures.  
真治和健介都爆发出孩子般的欢欣，惊叹于这庞大的海洋生物群。光只是在一旁轻笑，目光随着那些奇异的生物游移。

Even Rei seemed entranced by the movements of the fish, dolphins, and turtles that seemed to fly in their massive blue tank.  
就连丽也似乎被鱼儿、海豚和乌龟在巨大的蓝色水箱中飞舞的姿态所吸引。

In the back, his lip twitched at the happiness and excitement each of them felt, and he himself had a genuine feeling of euphoria at the sight.  
在后方，他感受到每个人心中的喜悦与兴奋，嘴角不禁微微抽动，自己也被眼前的景象激发出真切的愉悦感。

This could have been them in his life. The class trip to Okinawa, he knew it had the largest aquarium in the world on the island. He imagined if it would have been like this if he had been able to join them.  
这本可以是他在生活中的场景。那次去冲绳的班级旅行，他知道岛上拥有世界上最大的水族馆。他想象着如果他能加入他们，会是怎样的情景。

_He watched Soryu as she walked up to one of the tanks, trying to put her hand on the glass, trying to just feel the chill from the water.  
他看着 Soryu 走向其中一个水箱，试图将手放在玻璃上，只想感受一下水的寒意。_

"So, this is what the ocean looked like before the Second Impact."  
“所以，这就是第二次冲击前海洋的样子。”

"Wow look at that one with the shell on his back."  
"哇，看那个背上背着壳的。"

"I think those are called turtles…"  
"我觉得那叫乌龟……"

Shinji's joy was interrupted by that comment, he stopped walking for a moment and watched his three classmates with their imaginations captured by the simple sight of sea life.  
真嗣的喜悦被那句话打断了，他停下脚步，看着他的三个同学被这简单的海洋生物景象所吸引，想象力飞扬。

_They've missed this. 他们错过了这个。_

They had no notion of an ocean teaming with life.  
他们对充满生命的海洋一无所知。

That one detail, the one that he looked over, a red ocean, a dead ocean, it had stripped everyone of idea of sea life.  
那一个细节，他忽视的那一点，红色的海洋，死寂的海洋，让人们失去了对海洋生命的所有想象。

And yet it had given them this one glorious moment to rediscover it.  
然而，它却赐予了他们这一刻，让他们重新发现这份辉煌。

But him… he couldn't fully partake in either experience, he couldn't understand it no matter how he tried.  
但他……却无法完全融入这两种体验，无论他如何努力，都无法理解。

A grumbling voice caught his attention, Kaji had left them to go talk to some of the staff, and Rei was entranced by a pillar of small fish, but a certain German was seated away from them, not taking an interest in anything.  
一阵咕哝声吸引了他的注意，加治已经离开他们去和一些工作人员交谈，丽正被一柱小鱼吸引，但某个德国人却独自坐在远处，对任何事物都提不起兴趣。

_Don't leave me. 别离开我。_

He had made a promise.  
他曾许下承诺。

He walked over to her, to the bomb that he now had to disarm, if that was even possible.  
他走向她，走向那个他现在必须拆除的炸弹，如果这还有可能的话。

She was on her WonderSwan again, despite the sight around them, did she really want to drown out the world that much?  
她又在玩她的 WonderSwan 了，尽管周围景象如此，她真的想如此彻底地隔绝这个世界吗？

"Do they have aquariums in Germany?" he asked, in truth he couldn't remember if they did or if he ever asked her before.  
“德国有水族馆吗？”他问道，实际上他记不清是否有，或者他是否曾问过她。

"Of course, they do idiot," she mumbled, not bothering to look up from her game  
“当然有，笨蛋，”她咕哝着，懒得从游戏中抬起头来

He frowned at looked at her seated on a pipe, a sinking dread in his stomach. This was very much unknown territory for him, but he had to do this, for her.  
他皱着眉头，看着她坐在管道上，心中涌起一股沉重的恐惧。这对他来说是完全未知的领域，但他必须这么做，为了她。

Shinji sat down next to her, he could practically feel her tense up, and her eyes narrow, she wanted him gone.  
真嗣在她旁边坐下，几乎能感觉到她的紧张和眼神的锐利，她希望他离开。

"Tell me about them." He asked.  
“给我讲讲他们。”他问道。

"Look at the tanks and you'll see for yourself." She growled at him, he anticipated a kick or a punch, but nothing came his way other than the venom in her voice.  
"看看那些坦克，你自己就会明白。" 她对他咆哮道，他预料会有一脚或一拳袭来，但除了她声音中的毒液，什么也没有。

"I want to know about your German ones" he said looking over to her. "They must be pretty great if you're bored here." He said eying her game, then looking back at the tank that was behind them.  
"我想知道你的德国坦克。" 他看着她说，"如果在这里你都觉得无聊，那它们一定很了不起。" 他瞥了一眼她的游戏，然后回头看向他们身后的那辆坦克。

"I'm willing to bet that it didn't have whales though…" He said as one lumbered past them, casting a massive shadow on the wall that was in front of them.  
"我敢打赌，它们可没有鲸鱼……" 他说着，一辆坦克缓缓驶过他们，在面前的墙上投下巨大的阴影。

"No idiot they didn't have whales," she spat "they're not that great anyways."  
“他们才没有鲸鱼呢，”她不屑地说，“反正也没那么了不起。”

"So, what's your idea of a cool sea creature?" he asked, god that sounded so weird.  
"那么，你心目中酷炫的海底生物是什么样的？" 他问道，天哪，这话听起来真奇怪。

"Haie," she said with a smirk "evolved to be perfect predators."  
"鲨鱼，" 她带着一丝戏谑地说，"进化成了完美的捕食者。

He nodded, but frowned slightly "Orcas are mine, insanely smart to, they work together as teams you know…"  
他点点头，但微微皱眉，"虎鲸是我的最爱，它们聪明得不可思议，你知道的，它们会团队协作……"

He smirked back at her "they're known to kill sharks."  
他朝她得意一笑：“它们可是以杀死鲨鱼著称的。”

"They _were_ known to, idiot." She said glaring at him, he shrugged, that little slip wouldn't hurt anyone.  
“它们确实有这个名声，白痴。”她瞪着他，他耸耸肩，这点小失误伤不了人。

Getting up he rubbed his arms from the chill radiating off the tanks.  
他站起身，摩擦着因水箱散发出的寒气而感到冰冷的双臂。

"I made a surprise for lunch."  
"我为午餐准备了一个惊喜。"

"Another bland serving of rice." She shot at him.  
"又是平淡无奇的一碗饭。" 她朝他投去一瞥。"

"Not exactly." "不尽然。"

He walked off, heading up to Rei who was still entranced by the pillar of fish.  
他走开了，朝丽走去，她仍被那根鱼柱深深吸引着。

She held her hand against the glass, seemingly bewitched by the slowly rotating sea life.  
她将手贴在玻璃上，仿佛被缓缓旋转的海底生物迷住了。

"I'm glad you got to come with us Rei, how are you feeling?" What was he supposed to ask the clone, 'hey I know you're being 'backed up' by Gendo, wanna spill any secrets you've got?'.  
“很高兴你能和我们一起来，丽，你感觉怎么样？”他该怎么问这个克隆人呢，‘嘿，我知道你被碇源堂‘备份’了，想不想透露点你知道的秘密？’。

"Fine… I was able to come today since I finished my late assignments."  
"好吧……我今天能来是因为我完成了那些拖了很久的作业。"

He leaned back against the railing for the catwalk they were on, she hadn't made a single movement, her hand was still on the glass.  
他向后靠在他们在的空中走廊的栏杆上，她一动未动，手仍放在玻璃上。

"It must be horrible for the fish in there… going around in endless circles." He mused.  
"鱼在里面一定很惨吧……不停地绕圈子。" 他沉思道。

"No… these little ones couldn't live outside this tank."  
"不…这些小家伙无法在这个水箱外生存。"

He shrugged "Maybe they'd grow bigger and survive if they got out."  
他耸耸肩：“也许它们会长大一些，如果离开这里的话就能活下来。”

Rei said nothing, the Third Children was about to say something when he heard a rather loud 'gark' from a certain penguin he had forgotten about.  
丽没有说话，第三适格者正要开口，却听到一只他忘记了的企鹅发出相当响亮的‘嘎克’声。

Dashing off, the boy hoped that Pen Pen hadn't found himself in too much trouble.  
男孩匆匆离去，希望 Pen Pen 没有惹上太多麻烦。

ʡʘʘʢ

"Here you guys go," Shinji said pushing boxes into the hands of his friends, while glaring at Pen Pen. Somehow the bird had gotten into one of the keepers' buckets of fish that should have been for the other penguins in the facility.  
“给你们。”真嗣说着将箱子塞到朋友们手中，同时瞪了 Pen Pen 一眼。不知怎么的，这只鸟钻进了饲养员为其他企鹅准备的一桶鱼里。

It had taken them 10 minutes to calm the irate penguin down after taking the bucket from him and now he was going to happily chow down on even more food.  
从 Pen Pen 那里夺过桶后，他们花了 10 分钟才让那只愤怒的企鹅平静下来，而现在它又要开心地大吃一顿了。

Shinji swore that penguin should be heavily overweight after living with Misato for so long.  
真嗣发誓，那只企鹅跟美里生活了这么久，肯定已经胖得不成样子了。

"Its amazing how good 90% artificial meat can taste!"  
"真是不可思议，90%的人造肉竟然能如此美味！"

"Seriously Shinji how can you cook _this_ good?" Hikari asked after swallowing her first bite.  
“说真的，真嗣，你怎么能做得这么好吃？”光吃完第一口后问道。

"You know Shinji, men who can cook get all the girls." Kaji said winking at him.  
“你知道吗，真嗣，会做饭的男人最讨女孩子欢心了。”加持对他眨了眨眼说。

Kensuke nudged Toji at the comment, who simply grumbled to himself. The Third Children was sure it had to do with the pig-tailed girl sitting next to him.  
听到这话，剑介用胳膊肘捅了捅阿薰，后者只是自言自语地嘟囔着。第三适格者确信这一定和坐在他旁边的马尾女孩有关。

Shinji was about to come up with an excuse for having several lifetimes of cooking experience and how plenty of that was with subpar ingredients, but a redhead saved him from having to explain.  
真嗣正要编个借口，解释自己为何拥有几辈子的烹饪经验，以及其中大部分是如何用劣质食材完成的，但一位红发女孩替他解了围。

"Oh, so everyone else gets lunch but me!" Asuka raged at the now sheepishly looking boy who picked a last box from his backpack.  
“哦，所以大家都吃午饭，就我没有！”明日香对着现在看起来有些尴尬的男孩怒吼，他正从背包里拿出最后一个盒子。

"One last specialty for our German pilot." He quipped as he pushed the box in front of her.  
“这是我们德国飞行员最后的特色。”他打趣道，将盒子推到她面前。

Everyone else took bites of their food, complimenting the chief as Asuka opened hers.  
其他人纷纷品尝食物，并向主厨表示赞赏，而明日香则打开了她的那份。

She stopped. 她停住了。

Königsberger Klopse 柯尼斯堡肉丸

She just stared at it, not quite accepting the reality of it being there.  
她只是盯着它，不太能接受它真实存在的事实。

"Thought you might want a something more familiar for a change." He said, "Hope I didn't butcher it too badly."  
“想着你可能想换点熟悉的东西尝尝。”他说，“希望没把它做得太糟。”

That was a bold-faced lie, he'd perfected the recipe a long time ago.  
这完全是睁眼说瞎话，他早就把这食谱练得炉火纯青了。

Asuka steadied her hands as she grabbed a meatball, it looked fine, the white sauce seemed perfect, and it smelled good, so she took a bite.  
明日香稳住双手，抓起一个肉丸，它看起来不错，白酱似乎完美，闻起来也很香，于是她咬了一口。

_Home 家_

For the first time since she landed in Japan, she felt a foreign feeling in her stomach.  
自从她抵达日本以来，第一次在胃里感受到一种异样的感觉。

Was that homesickness? Her mind wandered to what happened last night, before the Third Child walked into her room, how she couldn't sleep because of those thoughts of home, but now…  
那是思乡之情吗？她的思绪飘回到昨晚，在三笠走进她房间之前，她因那些对家的思念而无法入眠，但现在……

No, why would she want to be back there!  
不，她怎么会想回到那里！

Asuka suddenly realized that Shinji was still looking at her, waiting for her response. Luckily, everyone else was busy scarfing down their food to notice what was going on.  
明日香突然意识到，真嗣还在看着她，等待她的回应。幸运的是，其他人都在忙着狼吞虎咽地吃东西，没注意到发生了什么。

"Its… acceptable." She mumbled before taking another bite.  
“还……行吧。”她咕哝着，又咬了一口。

ʡʘʘʢ

Kaji just leaned against the railing, soaking in the sun and the breeze.  
加持只是靠在栏杆上，沐浴着阳光和微风。

This kid was with him, he didn't even realize the others had gone up to the tower next to them, all except Toji who was being dragged down the wall by Hikari. Kaji smiled at the sight of the two, he could tell that they could be great for each other.  
这孩子和他在一起，他甚至没注意到其他人已经上到了他们旁边的塔楼，除了被光拖着沿墙下滑的冬二。加持看着这一幕，微笑着，他看得出他们俩很般配。

He looked at the boy next to him, he'd seen the boy from a distance when he first arrived at the GeoFront, but he hadn't seen the boy that was depicted by his file. Instead, he had seen just some normal (as much as any of them could be) kid, not a socially inept introvert who cowered at everything.  
他看着身边的男孩，初到 GeoFront 时曾远远见过这孩子，但那并非档案中所描述的模样。相反，他看到的只是一个普通（尽管在他们之中谁都不算普通）的孩子，而非一个社交障碍、对一切都畏缩不前的内向者。

He also would have never guessed the boy had been a corpse for 6 hours either.  
他也绝不会料到，这男孩曾是一具尸体长达六小时。

Just looking at the 14-year-old, he looked old, too old. The spy had caught glances of him when the others weren't looking and well…  
仅仅看着那个 14 岁的孩子，他就显得过于苍老，太过沧桑。间谍曾在其他人未曾注意时瞥见过他，而那……

Those eyes… 那双眼睛……

Sometimes he seemed colder than his father, older to.  
有时他似乎比他父亲还要冷漠，也显得更老成。

Right now, he could swear those eyes weren't looking at the facility, instead at the crimson sea beyond or even something _farther_ that no one else could see.  
此刻，他敢肯定那双眼睛并非在注视着设施，而是在凝望着设施之外的赤红海洋，甚至更遥远的地方，那是其他人所无法看见的。

"You know Shinji, I'm surprised we were able to restore the environment enough for your generation to be born."  
"你知道吗，真嗣，我很惊讶我们能恢复环境到足以让你们这一代出生的程度。"

He nodded "I guess," then he sniffed the air "I barely noticed the smell."  
他点头道：“我想也是，”然后他嗅了嗅空气，“我几乎没注意到那股味道。”

The older man must have taken it as a small joke, but the boy was serious, the smell of the natural sea had gone unnoticed to him until now, only after it had been absent.  
那位年长者或许将其视为一个小玩笑，但男孩是认真的，直到现在，直到它消失之后，他才意识到自然海风的气味对他来说已变得如此陌生。

"It's what the oceans supposed to smell like, this world was once brimming with the vast and beautiful diversity of life,"  
"这就是海洋应有的气息，这个世界曾经充满了广阔而美丽的生命多样性，"

He paused looking up at the others in the tower.  
他停顿了一下，抬头望向塔中的其他人。

"I wanted you guys to know that."  
"我想让你们知道这一点。"

A small silence came down between them as the soft breeze put out the man's cigarette. He lit another, before the kid finally spoke up.  
一阵短暂的沉默在他们之间降临，轻柔的微风熄灭了男人的香烟。他点燃了另一根，直到孩子终于开口。

"Misato should have come, you two used to live together right?"  
“美里本该来的，你们俩以前不是住在一起吗？”

Kaji couldn't help but raise an eyebrow, "How'd you know about that?"  
加持忍不住挑了挑眉，“你怎么知道那件事的？”

The kid shrugged "You two know each other, you make her happy, it makes sense, so what happened?"  
孩子耸了耸肩，“你们俩认识，你让她开心，这很合理，那后来发生了什么？”

This was a little weird, talking about his love life to a kid.  
跟一个孩子谈论他的爱情生活，这有点奇怪。

Then again, who was he to judge, the man knew there was more to the Third Child than meets the eye.  
不过话说回来，他有什么资格评判呢？这位男士知道，第三子远不止表面所见那么简单。

"We did, but I'm sure that's not the only reason she didn't come here."  
“我们的确有过，但我确信那不是她没来这里的唯一原因。”

"She doesn't like to talk about it, but she survived the Second Impact… She was there at the South Pole; her father was a man who lived in his research and his dreams. She despised the very thought of him.  
她不喜欢谈论这件事，但她经历了第二次冲击……她在南极亲历了一切；她的父亲是一个活在研究和梦想中的人。她甚至厌恶想到他。

Although, in the end… she was saved by the very person she hated the most. When you go through something like that, accepting those who you've lost, and what they died for…it's a heavy burden being the sole survivor."  
尽管，最终……她被她最憎恨的人所救。当你经历了那样的事情，接受那些你失去的人，以及他们为何而死……作为唯一的幸存者，这是一种沉重的负担。

Shinji was being a bit too quiet after that last comment.  
自从那次评论后，真嗣变得过于沉默了。

He looked at the kid, his eyes… unfocused, he'd seen that stare before, but never from someone this young.  
他看着那孩子，眼神……茫然无措，他曾见过那样的目光，但从没在一个如此年轻的人身上看到过。

"Just know, we all have our pain."  
“要知道，我们每个人都有自己的痛苦。”

"I think she wanted share that with you… "  
“我想她是想与你分享那份感受……”

Kaji just blinked. 加治只是眨了眨眼。

"She pushed you away, because she didn't want to risk feeling that pain again and you let her."  
“她推开了你，因为她不想再经历那种痛苦，而你却任由她这么做。”

Kaji stared at the boy, waiting, there had to be more to this. Was that desperation he felt?  
加治盯着那个男孩，等待着，事情肯定不止这些。他感受到的是绝望吗？

"Someone once told me the kanji for 'she' means 'a woman far away' and that women are on the opposite shore of a river wider and deeper than any ocean, so we can never truly know them."  
"曾有人告诉我，'她'这个汉字意为'远方的女人'，而女性仿佛位于一条比任何海洋都更宽更深的河流对岸，我们永远无法真正了解她们。"

He said that with such conviction and they might've been the truest words the man had felt in a long time.  
他说这话时语气如此坚定，或许这是他许久以来感受到的最真切的话语。

"Sounds like he was a wise man."  
"听起来他是个智者。"

"He was an idiot… in the exact situation as you, only he missed his chance… and didn't realize until it was too late."  
“他是个傻瓜……和你处在同样的境地，只是他错过了机会……等到发现时已经太迟了。”

"That opposite shore is closer than anyone thinks… all you have to do is take that first step and it'll be so clear. You'll never know what you were so scared of."  
对岸其实比任何人想象的都要近……你只需迈出那第一步，一切就会变得如此清晰。你永远不会知道自己在害怕什么。

Clearing his throat and reminding himself this was a kid, Kaji did his best to compose himself.  
清了清喉咙，提醒自己这只是个孩子，加持尽力让自己镇定下来。

"Listen, it's a bit more complicated, you'll know once you find someone."  
“听着，这有点复杂，等你找到那个人就会明白了。”

Shinji just stared at the distance, silent, ah maybe that was it.  
真嗣只是凝视着远方，沉默不语，啊，或许就是这样吧。

"Unless, you already did?" God was young for that, but if every mission was a ticket waiting to be punched, who was he to judge?  
"除非，你已经做过了？" 上帝对此还年轻，但如果每次任务都是一张待打的票，他又有什么资格评判呢？

"Shinji with the smooth moves, what's she like?" Kaji asked, glad to be on the offensive, he was a damn spy, extracting information was his job.  
"真嗣那小子动作挺利索的，她怎么样？" 加持问道，很高兴能占据主动，他可是个该死的间谍，套取情报是他的工作。

Shinji's face remained unchanged, not even a blush.  
真嗣的脸色依旧不变，连一丝红晕都没有。

"It was a lifetime ago."  
"那已经是上辈子的事了。"

"You're too young to be saying that" he joked.  
"你这么年轻，说这话还太早了。" 他打趣道。"

"hmm." "嗯。"

"What _was_ she like?" "她是什么样的？"

He hesitated, Kaji thought he could see him wrestling with himself, deciding whether or not to show him a piece of his heart.  
他犹豫了，加持觉得他似乎在内心挣扎，决定是否向他展示自己内心的一部分。

In the end the heart usually wins though.  
最终，通常还是心胜出了。

"Fire… and ice… she meant everything she said, but at the same time she didn't."  
“火与冰……她说的每一句话都是真心的，但同时又不是。”

He stopped and raised a lazy hand up, his thumb brushing against his lips. Kaji could tell this wasn't some teenage crush, whatever this kid had… there was a stab of jealousy in the man's heart.  
他停下脚步，懒洋洋地举起手，拇指轻触嘴唇。凯吉看得出这不仅仅是青春期的迷恋，无论这孩子有什么……他的心中涌起了一丝嫉妒。

"Pain, pleasure… she… hated me… just knowing me… it hurt her; I didn't know it… but she wanted me… _needed_ me… I ran, because I didn't understand then, even though I wanted her as well, even though I could have _understood_ her too."  
“痛苦，快乐……她……恨我……仅仅是因为认识我……就让她受伤了；我不知道……但她想要我……需要我……我逃了，因为那时我不明白，尽管我也想要她，尽管我本可以理解她。”

"all I ever did was run then… because I was scared…"  
"我所做的不过是逃跑……因为我害怕……"

The boy went quiet as another gust of wind went between the two of them. His eyes never leaving the distant horizon.  
男孩沉默下来，又一阵风吹过他们之间。他的目光始终未曾离开遥远的地平线。

"Well, c'mon now, you're the dashing pilot of EVA Unit-01, I'd bet she'd fall head over heels for you now."  
"好了，快点，你可是 EVA 初号机的英勇驾驶员，我敢打赌她现在会为你神魂颠倒。"

"No… it's not that simple."  
"不…没那么简单。"

"Don't you remember her phone number, what was her name?"  
"你不记得她的电话号码了吗，她叫什么名字？"

He shook his head. 他摇了摇头。

"I'd bet if you gave me her name, I'd be able to find her for you..." but he was cut off.  
"我敢打赌，只要告诉我她的名字，我就能帮你找到她……" 但他话还没说完就被打断了。

"Kaji..." Shinji turned to look at the man and the spy's face fell.  
"加持……" 真嗣转头看向那人，间谍的脸色顿时沉了下来。

Those eyes, they weren't the same as the ones from his file picture, no one his age should have them, there was, so much pain…  
那双眼睛，和档案照片里的不一样，没有人在这个年纪应该拥有那样的眼神，里面充满了太多的痛苦……

Yet, there were no tears…  
然而，没有泪水……

"_I_ failed _her_." the teen said, for a moment Kaji didn't understand "She needed me and I failed her."  
"我让她失望了。" 少年说道，有那么一刻，Kaji 没明白过来，"她需要我，我却让她失望了。"

"She's gone." "她已经走了。"

He deflated, and if the man understood those words right… no kid should feel responsible for _that._  
他顿时泄了气，如果那人理解对了这些话……没有孩子应该为此感到责任重大。

Oh Shinji... 哦，真嗣……

**Yeah, that's the stuff right there. I think when I wrote this chapter it was the most fun I've had so far this story. I've spent hours just tweeking the dialogue and I'm still not truly happy with it, but I think it's the best it can be.  
没错，就是这种感觉。我觉得当我写到chapter时，这是迄今为止我在这篇故事中最开心的时刻。我花了好几个小时调整对话，仍然不完全满意，但我认为这已经是最好的了。**

**Plus, I don't know if it was intentional or not by Anno, but the world's 2****nd** **biggest aquarium is on Okinawa (**_**the**_ **largest when it opened in 2002), and the class trip in NGE Epsiode 10 is to Okinawa. Could be a coincidence for 2.0 but I thought it was cool.**  
而且，我不确定这是否是庵野秀明有意为之，但世界第二大水族馆位于冲绳（2002 年开放时曾是最大的），而《新世纪福音战士》第 10 集中的班级旅行目的地正是冲绳。对于 2.0 版本来说，这可能是巧合，但我个人觉得挺酷的。

**SHOUTOUTS! 特别鸣谢！**

**The mysterious… 神秘的……**

**Guest!****- Well thanks for that, hope you enjoy all the chapters to come!**  
客人！——嗯，谢谢你的关注，希望你喜欢接下来的所有章节！

**All rightly, I'll be back in a day or two with the next chapter. By the way, this is the longest chapter to date, but I don't** ****really** think they'll stay this long.  
好吧，我一两天后会带着下一章回来。顺便说一下，这是迄今为止最长的一章，但我并不认为它们会一直这么长。

**Until Next Time! 下次再见！**

### Chapter 13: "... As my Guitar Gently Weeps…"  
Chapter 13: "... 当我的吉他轻柔哭泣…"

Kozo looked down at the crimson circular 'vortex' that rested over the South Pole.  
Kozo 低头看着覆盖在南极上方的鲜红色圆形'漩涡'。

"It's hard to accept that that's our earth," he mused to the only other occupant currently seated with him in the spacecraft. "It breaks my heart to even look at it."  
"很难接受那就是我们的地球，"他向航天器中唯一与他同坐的另一位乘客沉思道，"光是看着它就让我心碎。"

"It's even worse knowing there are other human beings who wanted this outcome," Gendo responded "to see the extinction of their own species to cleanse the earth of original sin."  
"更糟糕的是，知道还有其他人类希望这样的结局，"碇源堂回应道，"为了净化地球上的原罪，他们宁愿看到自己物种的灭绝。"

"I prefer the living chaos of man, instead of this barren wasteland of death." The old professor mused as he shuffled in his spacesuit.  
"我更喜欢人类那充满生机的混乱，而不是这片死寂的荒芜之地。"老教授一边在宇航服中挪动，一边沉思道。"

Why they were still wearing these inside the cabin was a mystery to him.  
为什么他们还在船舱内穿着这些，对他来说是个谜。

"Chaos is merely a human construct, the world only knows its own natural laws, of harmony and order."  
“混乱只是人类的构想，世界只遵循其自身的自然法则，和谐与秩序。”

"So, you're saying it's the human heart that throws the world into confusion?"  
“那么，你是说世界之所以混乱，是因为人心所致？”

Both men were quiet at that question, there wasn't even a glace over to him from his superior.  
面对这个问题，两人都沉默了，他的上司甚至没有向他投来一眼。

Then he had to ask.  
然后他不得不问。

"Do you believe it was the chaos of man that brought your son back, surely it couldn't be nature itself?"  
“你认为是你儿子的归来是人类混乱的结果吗？当然，这不可能是自然本身的作用吧？”

The eldest Ikari just closed his eyes. "What happened is not relevant, as long as it does not impact our plans."  
碇源堂只是闭上了眼睛。“发生了什么并不重要，只要不影响我们的计划。”

Kozo just looked back out the window, trying to accept that this could still be the young man he had met all those years ago.  
小津只是再次望向窗外，试图接受这仍可能是多年前他所遇见的那个年轻人。

"Do you believe Kaji Ryoji is going to continue to be of assistance?"  
“你认为加持良治会继续提供帮助吗？”

"He brought us the Key of Nebuchadnezzar, that's enough for now. As long as the man doesn't dig too deep, he's of no concern."  
"他给我们带来了尼布甲尼撒之钥，这已经足够了。只要这个人不挖得太深，他就不足为虑。"

ʡʘʘʢ

Unknown to the two older men, thousands of miles below them in Tokyo-03, a boy was setting a guitar case down on a rooftop.  
两位年长者并不知情，在千里之外的东京-03，一个男孩正将吉他盒放在一栋屋顶上。

Shinji let his feet dangle over the edge of the apartment blocks roof and lifted the musical instrument onto his thigh.  
真嗣让双脚悬在公寓楼顶的边缘，将这件乐器抬到大腿上。

Stretching out his right hand, he gave his knuckles a quick flex and stretch.  
他伸出右手，快速地弯曲和伸展着指关节。

As he plucked each string, the boy's face fell at how horribly this thing was tuned, probably by some student who hadn't know what they were doing. That was alright, it wasn't like the thing was broken.  
当他拨动每一根弦时，男孩的脸色因这东西调得如此糟糕而变得沮丧，大概是某个不懂行的学生胡乱调的。不过没关系，这东西又没坏。

He worked his way through the six strings, letting each reverberate their note a few seconds before adjusting the nob at the top of the instrument.  
他逐一拨过六根弦，让每个音符回响几秒后，再调整乐器顶端的旋钮。

The Third Children was sure that if there were Section 2 personnel out there, they would see him, at least if they were watching the apartment directly.  
第三适格者确信，如果有第二支部的人员在外监视，他们至少会注意到他，前提是他们直接监视着公寓。

But there was no reason for them to really interfere, he was just a kid practicing his instruments in the fresh air.  
但他们没有理由真的干预，他只不过是个在新鲜空气中练习乐器的孩子。

It just happened to be on the edge of the rooftop.  
只不过恰好是在屋顶边缘罢了。

Looking down at the streets below, there were only a few people who were out and about at this time of night. He had been sure to sneak out after Misato had fallen asleep and Asuka wouldn't be out of her room for the rest of the night.  
俯瞰着下方的街道，深夜时分只有寥寥数人还在外游荡。他特意等到美里睡着后才悄悄溜出，而明日香今晚也不会离开她的房间。

It wasn't like he would sleep either. He figured this was at least better than just staring at his ceiling and being tormented with the memories of his failures.  
他今晚同样无法入眠。至少，他认为这样在外游荡总比躺在床上，被失败的记忆折磨要好。

Not to mention how those feelings had once again been stirred up by his talk with Kaji.  
更不用说，与加治的那番谈话再次激起了他的这些情感。

Truthfully, he had felt slightly better after leaving the man, like the tiniest weight had been lifted from his shoulders. When was the last time he actually _talked_ with someone about those things? Even if he managed to obscure most of the details, it had just felt good despite the pain of actually saying those things… _admitting_ those things.  
说实话，离开那个人后，他感觉稍微好了一点，仿佛肩上卸下了最微小的重担。他上一次真正和别人谈论这些事情是什么时候？即使他设法掩盖了大部分细节，尽管说出这些事情、承认这些事情很痛苦，但那种感觉还是很好……

"_Oh, just stop feeling sorry for yourself and get on with it already!" the specter growled, looking to his left, he just watched as she balanced herself while she walked along the very edge of the roof._  
“哦，别再自怨自艾了，赶紧行动吧！”幽灵咆哮道，他向左看去，只见她一边沿着屋顶边缘行走，一边保持平衡。

_Her figure wobbled from time to time as she walked, her one eye focused solely on the ledge.  
她走路时身影不时摇晃，一只眼睛只盯着屋檐。_

_Shinji might have felt a bit of worry, if it wasn't for the fact she wasn't really there. He hadn't said a word to her since their talk in the locker room after the sync test and it seemed as if she was irritated by that.  
如果不是因为她实际上并不在那里，真嗣或许会感到一丝担忧。自从同步测试后在更衣室的谈话以来，他一句话也没跟她说过，而她似乎因此感到恼火。_

Resting his forearm against the top of the instrument, he let his hand hover over the strings, waiting for his mind to remember a song.  
他将前臂靠在乐器顶部，手悬在弦上，等待着记忆中的旋律浮现。

His fingers came to life on their own, letting out the same three notes over and over again. It was a simple tune, but one that he remembered well.  
他的手指自发地动了起来，一遍又一遍地弹出相同的三个音符。这是一首简单的曲子，但他记得很清楚。

Letting himself insert different strings as he went along, he began to shake off the rust of this skill.  
他一边进行，一边随意更换着琴弦，开始摆脱这项技能的生疏感。

These might not be the muscles that learned how to play, but the mind was.  
这些或许不是学会演奏的肌肉记忆，但思维却是。

He kept going, letting the song build until its speed began to increase. He was no longer plucking at the strings, instead he was lightly strumming them.  
他继续下去，让曲子逐渐展开，直到速度开始加快。他不再只是拨弄琴弦，而是轻快地扫过它们。

It was such a simple song, but… it just came out on its own. It seemed to make him feel the weight of time itself and how long he had been going.  
这首歌如此简单，但……它自然而然地流淌出来。仿佛让他感受到了时间的重量，以及自己已经走了多久。

How long he had been fighting.  
他已经战斗了多久。

The notes made him feel tired, like he could sleep for a thousand years and still not feel rested.  
这些音符让他感到疲惫，仿佛可以沉睡千年，依旧无法恢复精力。

It seemed to fade as fast it came, like a spirt of energy, before he was back in the same three note repetitive loop.  
它似乎来去匆匆，犹如一股能量之灵，转眼间他又回到了那单调的三音符循环中。

Finally, his fingers finished, and his hand just fell, hanging there. They burned due to the lack of calluses, but he relished the feeling in his fingertips.  
终于，他的手指弹奏完毕，手无力地垂下。由于缺乏老茧，手指火辣辣地疼，但他却享受着指尖的这种感觉。

Why had he let himself play that? Of course it was going to make him feel miserable, wasn't he doing this to feel the opposite?  
他为何要让自己弹奏那曲子？当然，这只会让他感到痛苦，他不是为了体验相反的情感才这么做的吗？

_She was sitting beside him now, just looking out over the city with that sparkling blue iris, he could see her out of the corner of his eye, but he didn't dare turn to face her.  
她此刻正坐在他身旁，只是凝望着这座城市，那双闪烁着光芒的蓝色眼眸，他虽只用眼角余光瞥见，却不敢转头直视。_

_He was expecting her to mock how he had chosen such a sad song, or to berate him on how he had lost some of the sharpness of his skill. But she remained quiet. Just letting her feet dangle off the edge of the building, kicking them out every so often and letting them swing.  
他本以为她会嘲笑他选了这么一首悲伤的歌，或是责备他技艺中失去的锋芒。但她始终沉默不语，只是让双脚悬在楼边，时不时地踢动，任其摇摆。_

The Third Children just looked out over Tokyo-3 letting himself drink the sight in, the twinkling of ten thousand lights before him and the few stars above that were still visible. It wasn't quite the sight he had with Rei before the Sixth Angel, but it could be worse.  
第三适格者只是凝望着第三新东京市，让自己沉浸在这景象中，眼前是万家灯火，天空中依稀可见的几颗星星。虽然不及与零在第六使徒前的景象，但也不算太糟。

It gave him the same feeling he felt when all three of them had laid down on the hillside overlooking the city in his first life. Still in plug suits, just waiting for the power to be restored and enjoying the galaxy that was on full display for them in the night sky.  
这让他想起了第一世时，他们三人一起躺在山坡上俯瞰城市的那种感觉。依然穿着插入栓服，只是等待着电力恢复，享受着夜空中完全展现在他们面前的银河。

And it made him feel even smaller than usual.  
这让他感觉比平时更加渺小。

.

.

.

"I wish I could've saved you."  
"我真希望能救你。"

Those words just came out on their own, in a hushed tone, his shame, guilt, and everything else abruptly bubbling up with the girl so close to him yet being so quiet.  
那些话就这样自然而然地脱口而出，带着低沉的语调，他的羞愧、内疚以及所有情绪，突然间随着女孩近在咫尺却又异常安静的氛围而涌上心头。

"_Me too,"_  “我也是，”

_There was no malice in that voice, no venom, no uncontrollable anger directed at the Third Children.  
那声音中没有恶意，没有毒液，也没有针对第三代孩子们的无法控制的愤怒。_

_Just sadness. 只有悲伤。_

"_me too..."_ "我也是……"

ʡʘʘʢ

She had stared at screens and data for hours before she came to this conclusion.  
她在屏幕和数据前凝视了数小时，才得出这个结论。

In that time, the city had been evacuated, it had been a monumental task, but its match could easily be made in the backing up of the MAGI.  
那时，城市已经疏散，这是一项艰巨的任务，但在备份 MAGI 系统方面，其难度不相上下。

With the codename 'Wunder', even if the damn thing was in Austria, whoever had made the decision to name NERVs vault should take a look at their life choices. With the majority of NERV personnel having English as their second language it was hard enough with the language barrier.  
即便这个代号是‘Wunder’，哪怕这东西在奥地利，那些决定给 NERV 的保险库命名的家伙也应该审视一下他们的生活选择。由于 NERV 的大多数人员将英语作为第二语言，光是语言障碍就已经够难克服了。

She had to get on the phone herself to speak German when one of the technicians couldn't get past the whole German W pronounced as an English V. The situation had taken up too much precious time if she was being honest.  
当一名技术人员无法克服德语 W 发成英语 V 的难题时，她不得不亲自打电话用德语沟通。说实话，这种情况已经耗费了太多宝贵时间。

Now Katsuragi was standing here in a warehouse with an irritated scientist just glaring at her.  
此刻，桂木站在仓库里，一位不耐烦的科学家正怒视着她。

"You're hesitating." “你在犹豫。”

That, Misato wouldn't deny, she was.  
这一点，美里无法否认，她的确如此。

"Its just…" the woman stumbled over her words.  
"只是……" 女人结巴着说不出话来。

"Yes, it was _you_ who sent Shinji out, yes you're worried about him getting hurt again, but you need to get over than Misato."  
"是的，是你派真嗣出去的，是的，你担心他会再次受伤，但你需要克服这一点，美里。"

"Last time I checked he hasn't quit, he's still here Misato, and he's a soldier, just like the other two."  
"上次我确认时，他并没有退出，他还在这里，美里，他是一名士兵，就像其他两人一样。"

Misato shook her head, "They're not Rits, they're not soldiers."  
美里摇了摇头，“他们不是律子，他们不是士兵。”

"Where's the Katsuragi that boldly asked for the _entire_ power supply of Japan hmmm? First, you're practically mothering the Third Child, now you're not willing to do anything!"  
“那个大胆要求整个日本电力供应的葛城去哪儿了？先是几乎像母亲一样照顾第三适格者，现在又不愿意采取任何行动！”

She turned to the blonde, half thinking about smacking her across the face.  
她转向金发女子，半想着要给她一巴掌。

"Dammit Rits of course I am, this is the only chance we have, that doesn't mean I have to like it. Got any better ideas?"  
"该死，Rits，我当然在，这是我们唯一的机会，这并不意味着我必须喜欢它。你有什么更好的主意吗？"

Ritsuko sighed "No I don't, and neither do the MAGI, they wouldn't even give me a percentage for success."  
Ritsuko 叹了口气，"没有，MAGI 也没有，它们甚至没有给我成功的百分比。"

The woman could see Misato's struggle on the surface, she knew what drove her to be part of NERV  
这位女士可以看到 Misato 表面的挣扎，她知道是什么驱使她加入 NERV

Revenge. 复仇。

Revenge against the Angels.  
向使徒复仇。

It was something that almost everyone could understand, Ritsuko couldn't remember a time when the woman wasn't driven by that burning hatred.  
这是几乎所有人都能理解的事情，赤木律子记不清这个女人何时不是被那股炽烈的仇恨所驱使。

Except for now. 除了现在。

She was witnessing it firsthand, the struggle between the woman who wanted vengeance against the things that had taken her family from her, and the woman who had grown close to the Third Child, who had seemingly found a new family.  
她亲眼目睹了这一幕，一个女人想要向夺走她家人的事物复仇，与另一个和第三子关系密切、似乎找到了新家庭的女人的挣扎。

"You're too close to him." The blonde accused.  
"你离他太近了。"金发女子指责道。

"Maybe, I am," the Colonel mumbled.  
"或许吧，我确实是，" 上校咕哝道。

"but last time I checked; I'm still the commanding office here."  
"但上次我确认时；我仍然是这里的指挥官。

ʡʘʘʢ

"Whaaa? You want us to catch it?" Asuka practically shouted at Misato.  
"什么？你要我们去抓它？" 明日香几乎是对美里喊道。

All three of the pilots were currently standing in front of a whiteboard, below them, in what amounted to a train terminal, their Evangelions were being brough up from the GeoFront.  
三位驾驶员此刻正站在一块白板前，下方是一个类似火车站的场所，他们的 EVA 正从 GeoFront 中被运送上来。

_Shinji was doing his best to ignore Soryu as she hung her feet off the side of the catwalk while pushing herself up on the railing. It reminded him a little too much of how she had acted on_ Over the Rainbow.  
真嗣尽力忽视着丽在走道边缘晃动双脚，双手撑着栏杆推着自己上行的样子。这让他不由得想起了她在“彩虹之上”中的举止。

"Exactly as the target descends, you'll max out your AT field to stop it." The way she said it, it sounded so simple. Shinji knew there was going to be more to it than that.  
“当目标下降时，你将全力展开 AT 力场来阻止它。”她这么一说，听起来似乎很简单。但真嗣知道，事情绝不会这么简单。

And he was willing to bet there would be more than one surprise in store if they had skipped over Israfel, Sandalphon, _and_ Matarael… things were moving way too fast.  
而他敢打赌，如果他们跳过了伊斯拉菲尔、桑达尔丰和马塔拉尔，那么接下来定会有不止一个惊喜等着他们……事情进展得太快了。

"The target has scrambled its position so we can't accurately calculate its exact point of impact. In order to narrow the possibilities, all three EVAs will be simultaneously deployed in three different locations."  
"目标已变更位置，我们无法精确计算其撞击点。为了缩小可能性，三台 EVA 将同时在三个不同地点部署。"

She explained, pointing to her diagram on the board.  
她解释道，指着板上的图表。

"Listen, I can destroy this thing on my own!" the fiery redhead growled back at her.  
"听着，我一个人就能摧毁这东西！" 火红的头发女孩咆哮着回敬她。

"No way, it's impossible, the projected target area is too vast for one EVA to cover,"  
"不可能，这太不现实了，投影目标区域太广，一台 EVA 根本覆盖不了，"

"Oh, so you don't trust my abilities that's it?"  
"哦，所以你不相信我的能力，是吧？"

"Asuka," Shinji pinched the bridge of his nose. "Not every Angel is going to be beaten through straight combat, sometimes we're going to have to get creative."  
"明日香，"" 真嗣捏了捏鼻梁。""不是每个使徒都能通过正面战斗击败的，有时候我们得动动脑筋。"

"And we're going to have to be creative as a _team_."  
"作为团队，我们得发挥创造力。"

She looked over at him and just scowled at the comment. Technically even to them here, he had the most combat time and the most Angel kills.  
她朝他看了一眼，对这个评论只是皱了皱眉。严格来说，即使在这里，他的战斗经验最丰富，消灭的天使数量也最多。

Experience outranks everything, wasn't that the saying?  
经验胜过一切，这不是常说的话吗？

"How do you know where to place us?" Rei asked in her monotone voice, speaking up for the first time since they arrived at the briefing.  
"你怎么知道该把我们安排在哪里？" 丽用她一贯的单调声音问道，这是自他们到达简报室以来她第一次开口。

"Woman's intuition." The colonel said with a smile.  
"女人的直觉。" 上校微笑着说。

"Oh, that's reliable!" Asuka grumbled, crossing her arms.  
"哦，那可真可靠！" 明日香咕哝着，交叉双臂。

ʡʘʘʢ

As they went their separate ways to their own Evangelions, Shinji took a deep breath and let himself feel that cross that dug into his chest underneath his plug suit.  
当他们各自走向自己的 EVA 时，真嗣深吸一口气，让自己感受到那十字架在他插入栓服下刺入胸膛的感觉。

"Shinji…" “真嗣……”

He turned around; the violet-haired Colonel just stood there. Had anyone else looked at her, they would have seen an unmovable, unbreakable person, someone who had unshakable confidence in her plan.  
他转过身；那位紫发的上校就站在那里。如果其他人看向她，他们会看到一个坚定不移、坚不可摧的人，一个对自己的计划有着坚定信心的人。

He knew her long enough to see the truth. The woman was terrified.  
他对她了解得足够久，足以看清真相。这个女人害怕极了。

But not of the Angel.  
但不是对天使的恐惧。

To his eyes Misato was practically having a nervous breakdown in front of him, and just to confirm his thoughts she reached out and grabbed him, pulling him into an embrace like she did on the occasional night after a dozen beers.  
在他看来，美里几乎在他面前陷入了神经崩溃，为了证实他的想法，她伸出手抓住他，像偶尔喝了一打啤酒后的夜晚那样，将他拉入怀中紧紧拥抱。

Only this time there was no reek of alcohol on her. There were no slurred words, no tearless sobs.  
唯有这次，她身上没有酒气熏天。言语不再含糊，哭泣不再无声。

There was just her, Misato Katsuragi, latching onto him like she might lose him again.  
只有她，葛城美里，紧紧依附着他，仿佛生怕再次失去他。

"Promise me you'll come back."  
"答应我你会回来。"

Shinji just gave her a squeeze with his arms as well.  
真嗣也用双臂紧紧抱了她一下。

"Promise me you won't leave me again."  
"答应我你不会再离开我。"

The Third Children felt a stab of pain in his heart at those words. If only she had been like this the first time…  
第三适格者听到这些话，心中一阵刺痛。如果她第一次见面时就这样……

He knew what happened to her Shinji right before he ended up in this life had eaten away at the woman, enough for her to open herself up to him.  
他知道，在她进入这个生活之前，真嗣身上发生的事情已经深深伤害了她，以至于她愿意向他敞开心扉。

But he couldn't recall her ever being this attached, ever.  
但他记不起她曾经如此依恋过，从来没有。

"I'll come back Misato." "我会回来的，美里。"

"I promise." "我保证。"

Shinji just added another promise to the list of ones he knew he wouldn't be able to keep.  
真嗣又在那些他知道自己无法兑现的承诺清单上，添了一笔。

**If you're curious as to which song I based Shinji's tune off of, go check out Remembrance by Balmorhea. It's pretty popular background music for people to use so you've probably heard it somewhere, but if you haven't, if you want to get a bad case of melancholy check it out, you've been warned. I might make a cover image based off that rooftop scene, cant promise it'll be any good though… EOE cover anyone?  
如果你好奇我以哪首歌为灵感创作了真嗣的旋律，可以去听听 Balmorhea 的《Remembrance》。它作为背景音乐相当流行，你可能在某个地方听过，但如果你还没听过，想要体验一下忧郁的感觉，那就去听听吧，你已经被警告过了。我可能会根据那个屋顶场景制作一张封面图，但不能保证它会很好……有人想要 EOE 封面吗？**

**SHOUTOUTS! 特别鸣谢！**

**Akomis – Thanks, I think that's probably the hardest thing for people to write, because you have to make it sound** _**natural**_ **and that's where I always second guess myself.**  
Akomis – 谢谢，我认为这可能是人们写作时最难的部分，因为你必须让它听起来自然，而这正是我总是自我怀疑的地方。

**UltraSpink of Da USA- Well remember, Kaji is the closest thing to a father figure Shinji ever really had. In the manga he lives with his aunt and uncle and in the anime, I think it's a 'teacher'. Regardless of whichever backstory you like more, its obvious neither treated him very well. So, it makes sense Shinji can open up to Kaji even more than Misato, even remembering Kaji's words about how we can never truly know other people. Plus, Kaji's a spy, it's kinda his job to extract info without people even realizing it.  
UltraSpink of Da USA- 记住，加持是真嗣生活中最接近父亲形象的人。在漫画中，他和姑姑姑父住在一起，而在动画中，我想他是个‘老师’。不管你更喜欢哪个背景故事，很明显他们都没有好好对待他。因此，真嗣能向加持敞开心扉，甚至比对美里还要多，这很合理，他还记得加持关于我们永远无法真正了解他人的话。而且，加持是个间谍，他的工作就是不知不觉中获取信息。**

**poBBpC - I'm glad you like it! I'm gonna be honest, I had no idea what you were talking about until I looked it up on Youtube and I was like 'yeah, he's got a point…' (love that older graphics esthetic btw).  
poBBpC - 很高兴你喜欢！老实说，我一开始并不明白你在说什么，直到我在 YouTube 上查了一下，然后我就像‘对啊，他说得有道理……’（顺便说一句，我超爱那种老式图形美学）。**

**Dyinglittelstar – Thanks a lot!  
Dyinglittelstar – 非常感谢！**

**Until Next Time! 下次再见！**

### Chapter 14: "...We could be Heroes, just for one day…"  
Chapter 14: "...我们能成为英雄，只在这一天…"

Shinji always hated this plan.  
真嗣总是讨厌这个计划。

He always put its success down to luck or the will of the universe since it succeeded so much.  
他总是将其成功归因于运气或宇宙的意志，因为它如此频繁地取得成功。

So now he just sat there in his pod, readying to run this race against time once again.  
于是现在他只是坐在他的驾驶舱里，准备再次与时间赛跑。

Sighing he flipped on his comms to Unit-02, probably not a bad time to give Asuka a pep talk.  
他叹了口气，打开通讯器联系二号机，也许现在是时候给明日香打打气了。

"Asuka," There was no video, only audio, he wasn't sure if she turned it off, but he was sure that she could hear him.  
"明日香," 没有视频，只有音频，他不确信是她关闭了视频，但他确信她能听到他的声音。

"**[Remember, we're a team, even if you don't want to be,]**" he said reassuringly to the black box in front of him "**[we look out for each other… even if you won't, I will.]**"  
"[记住，我们是一个团队，即使你不想成为其中一员，]" 他对着面前的黑盒子安慰地说道，"[我们互相照顾……即使你不愿，我也会。]"

"I'll see you one the other side." he finished, leaving the comm link open for a few seconds, before terminating it.  
"我们另一边见。" 他结束道，留下通讯链接开着几秒钟，然后才关闭。

He breathed in LCL, and he closed his eyes.  
他吸入 LCL，然后闭上了眼睛。

Reaching out and into the depths of the EVA, making sure that the presence inside wouldn't retreat from him.  
他伸出手，深入 EVA 的深处，确保里面的存在不会从他身边退缩。

It didn't. 它没有。

Instead, it came to him and wrapped around him, while he made sure to keep it at what could only be described as 'arm's length' so it didn't see the real him.  
相反，它主动靠近并环绕着他，而他则小心翼翼地保持着所谓的‘一臂之距’，以免它窥见真实的他。

Comfort. 慰藉。

That's what he felt, comfort, this was his world, here in an EVA, in an entry plug, doing battles with unimaginable horrors.  
他感受到的就是这种慰藉，这里是他的世界，在 EVA 的插入栓内，与难以想象的恐怖战斗。

This was where he belonged.  
这是他归属的地方。

And that, he _hated_. 而这一点，他深恶痛绝。

No matter what he said to himself, no matter how many people smiled and thanked him for saving their lives, he still hated that this place gave him comfort and purpose.  
无论他如何自我安慰，无论多少人对他微笑，感谢他救了他们的命，他依然憎恨这个地方给予他的安慰和目标。

Because he had seen what his life could have been without it.  
因为他曾目睹过没有这一切，他的生活本可能是什么样子。

"Now go!" he heard Misato shout through his com-link, he didn't need to be told twice.  
“快去！”他听到美里通过通讯器大喊，无需再次催促。

He willed himself forwards, loosing traction before getting his footing.  
他努力向前移动，失去抓地力后重新稳住脚步。

His EVAs feet dug into the earth; the sheer weight of the giant sunk into the dirt.  
他的 EVA 脚部深深陷入地面；巨人的重量让泥土承受了巨大的压力。

_Faster. 更快。_

There was no need to worry about structures or people, they had been evacuated so he could have free reign on the land before him.  
无需担心建筑或人群，他们已被疏散，因此他可以在这片土地上自由施展。

In the distance he could see the orb that was supposed to be the Eighth Angel. Its black form completely alien to his eyes. In a way it almost looked like a black hole was falling from the sky, ready to decimate his world.  
远处，他能看到那个本应是第八使徒的球体。其黑色形态在他眼中完全陌生。某种程度上，它几乎像是一个黑洞从天而降，准备摧毁他的世界。

_His world… 他的世界……_

He hadn't thought of a life like that in so long.  
他已经很久没有想过那样的生活了。

Because he had to bear the thought of losing it. He had to fear not being fast enough, strong enough, he had to be reminded of the fear that he would make the same mistake in a moment of weakness again.  
因为他不得不承受失去它的想法。他必须害怕不够快、不够强，他必须被提醒，害怕自己会在软弱时刻再次犯下同样的错误。

Watching it fall from the sky, saw the black exterior shatter like glass, leaving only a multicolored orb.  
目睹它从天而降，黑色的外壳如玻璃般碎裂，仅留下一颗五彩斑斓的球体。

"Target's AT field has changed!"  
“目标的 AT 力场发生了变化！”

"Its trajectory is shifting!"  
“它的轨迹正在改变！”

Shinji knew he wouldn't make it if he had to change course, getting back up to speed would…  
真嗣知道，如果他必须改变航线，重新加速的话，他是赶不上的……

"Shinji, get ready!" he heard Misato call out over the comms.  
“真嗣，准备好了！”他听到美里在通讯器里喊道。

To his immediate right large barriers rose from the ground, forming a curved slope.  
在他的正右方，巨大的屏障从地面升起，形成了一个弧形的斜坡。

So that's what she's thinking.  
原来她在想这个。

Using the barriers to change directions, Shinji watched as towers rose from the ground, creating a makeshift stair for him to climb and ultimately jump from.  
利用屏障改变方向，真嗣看着一座座塔从地面升起，为他搭建了一道临时的阶梯，供他攀爬并最终跳下。

Landing and crushing the earth beneath him, he pushed himself faster. The boy could see the shock cone from him reaching the sound barrier. His shockwaves rippling over the countryside, leaving a path of destruction in their wake.  
落地并碾碎了脚下的土地，他加速前进。少年能看到自己突破音障时产生的冲击波。他的冲击波在乡间蔓延，所过之处留下一片狼藉。

Shinji watched as the Angel unraveled itself from the ball, now it actually resembled Sahaquiel, but being right below it, he knew it was much, much bigger.  
真嗣看着使徒从球体中展开，现在它确实更像萨哈魁尔了，但就在它下方，他清楚地知道它要大得多，大得多。

Fifty-fold, one hundred-fold? It certainly felt like it.  
五十倍，一百倍？确实感觉如此。

Skidding to a halt, his Unit-01s feet plowed through the soil beneath him, leaving long tracks in their wake.  
他急停滑行，01 号机的双脚犁过地面，留下长长的痕迹。

Finally stopping, Shinji allowed his AT field to expand, putting his full might behind the barrier. Around him houses were blown away like leaves, the flash from his AT field almost blinding him.  
最终停下时，真嗣让自己的 AT 力场扩张，全力施展屏障。周围的房屋像树叶般被吹散，AT 力场的光芒几乎让他目眩。

The Angel crashed into him, the weight and power shocking him, the force behind it defiantly larger than Sahaquiel.  
天使猛地撞向他，那重量与力量令他震惊，其背后的力道显然比萨哈奇尔还要强大。

For a moment they were locked there, both pushing against one another.  
有那么一刻，他们僵持不下，双方都在互相推挤。

Then, the other foot dropped.  
接着，另一只脚也落了下来。

The 'eye' of the angel opened, revealing a black figure with the vaguely similar 'face' that he had seen on so many Angels.  
天使的‘眼睛’张开，显露出一个黑色身影，其模糊相似的‘面孔’与他曾在众多天使身上见过的如出一辙。

"Oh, you've got to be shitting me!" he growled out.  
“哦，你他妈的在逗我吧！”他咆哮道。

The vaguely humanoid figure reached out to him, through the clashing AT fields and grabbed both his hands, crushing them with its grip.  
那个模糊的人形身影向他伸出手，穿过碰撞的 AT 力场，紧紧抓住他的双手，以握力将其碾压。

This was going to hurt.  
这会痛不欲生。

Its hands turned to spiraling spears, impaling his forearms, unleashing a spray of LCL.  
它的双手化作旋转的长矛，刺穿他的前臂，喷涌出 LCL 液体。

He forced himself not to make a sound, he would not let Misato have to hear more of his screams, not anymore.  
他强迫自己不发出声音，他不愿让美里再听到他的惨叫，再也不愿。

His EVAs arms bulged, only causing more of the red fluid to spray out and the ground beneath him cracked from the immense forces clashing against one another.  
他的 EVA 手臂鼓胀起来，更多的红色液体喷溅而出，地面在他脚下因巨大的力量相互碰撞而裂开。

"I'm almost there!" the Second Child shouted, off to his left.  
“我快到了！”第二适格者在他左侧喊道。

Hearing that voice, it was like the weight of the sky crashing down on him was easier to bare.  
听到那个声音，仿佛压在他身上的天空之重变得容易承受了。

"Unit-02 get the core," he heard Rei say as she rushed to him.  
"初号机，取核心，" 他听到绫波丽边向他冲来边说。

"I know that dammit!" "我知道，该死！"

"and don't you dare give me orders!"  
"你敢命令我试试！"

"30 seconds left." "还剩 30 秒。"

He saw Asuka leap and cut the AT field to his left, his attention now on her. She stabbed up at where the core must be, but he couldn't see it from his position.  
他看到明日香跳起，切开了他左侧的 AT 力场，他的注意力现在全在她身上。她朝核心所在的位置刺去，但他从自己的位置看不到那个核心。

"Did I miss?" she asked to no one in particular.  
“我打偏了吗？”她自言自语道。

The entire Angel pounded against his AT field again, he was hoping that this would be similar to the first, but it looked like that wasn't going to be that easy.  
整个使徒再次猛烈冲击他的 AT 力场，他希望这能和第一次类似，但看来事情并不会那么简单。

The arms of his EVA tore from the strain, his arms were on fire, but that didn't matter, not right now.  
他的 EVA 手臂因压力而撕裂，双臂如同燃烧般剧痛，但此刻这并不重要。

"Take your time Asuka." he said as calmly as he could manage, the 30 second time window seemingly forgotten.  
“慢慢来，明日香。”他尽可能平静地说道，仿佛忘记了那 30 秒的时间窗口。

To his right, Unit-00 tore through the AT, shooting up to where Asuka was.  
在他的右侧，零号机撕裂了 AT 力场，向着明日香所在的位置射击。

He couldn't see what was happening, just the shouting over the comms between the two, that didn't matter, at least not when he heard Asuka scream for the Angel to die, that was usually a good sign.  
他看不见发生了什么，只能听到通讯器中两人的呼喊，这并不重要，至少在他听到明日香尖叫着让使徒去死时，这通常是个好兆头。

For a moment nothing happened, before everything in front of him suddenly turned to a red liquid and rushed down onto him.  
有那么一刻什么都没发生，然后他眼前的一切突然化作红色液体，猛地向他冲刷而下。

Their EVAs were all submerged in this red liquid, it would recede in a moment, but he needed to make sure his team was alright.  
他们的舱外活动都浸在这红色液体中，它很快就会退去，但他必须确保他的团队安然无恙。

Taking energy from the emergency batteries he started trying to reach them on comms.  
他从应急电池中汲取能量，开始尝试通过通讯设备联系他们。

"Rei are you alright?" he asked.  
“丽，你还好吗？”他问道。

A monotone 'yes' was all he got before comms being cut on her end.  
他只得到了一个单调的“是”，随后她那边的通讯就被切断了。

Her. 她。

"Asuka," this time he had video.  
“明日香，”这次他有了视频。

She was there, curled up, knees to her chest.  
她就在那里，蜷缩着，双膝紧贴胸前。

"Mein Freund?" he asked, wanting to see her look up at him.  
"我的朋友？" 他问道，渴望看到她抬头望向他。

She refused, only curling up tighter, not even bothering to terminate the connection.  
她拒绝了，只是蜷缩得更紧，甚至懒得断开连接。

"**[You were great, your second Angel, we couldn't have done it without you.]**"  
"[你表现得很棒，你的第二使徒，没有你我们无法做到。]"

Somehow, reassuring her, the pain that pulsed in his arms wasn't as sharp.  
不知为何，安慰着她，他手臂上跳动的疼痛已不再那么剧烈。

She said nothing, she didn't even move.  
她一言不发，甚至一动不动。

As he looked at her thought the comm window, Gendo himself opened a comm link, a flare of annoyance washed over the boy as he cut off the connection before anything could be said. Equipment malfunction, that's what he'd tell them.  
当他透过通讯窗口看着她时，碇源堂自己打开了通讯链接，少年感到一阵恼怒的闪光，他在任何话被说出之前就切断了连接。设备故障，他会这么告诉他们。

"**[Do you want me to stay here until they get you out?]**" he asked, he wasn't even sure if the emergency power would last that long, but she didn't object to that either.  
"[你想让我留在这里直到他们把你救出去吗?]" 他问道，他甚至不确定紧急电源能否撑那么久，但她也没有反对。

She didn't say anything. 她什么也没说。

"**[Alright, I'm here.]**" "[好的，我在这儿。]"

ʡʘʘʢ

It had taken the recovery crew an awful long time to get all three of them out of their EVAs. Though, having to essentially sail through the streets of Tokyo-03 meant he couldn't really blame them.  
救援队花了相当长的时间才把他们三个从 EVA 中救出来。不过，考虑到他们几乎是在东京-03 的街道上航行，他实在无法责怪他们。

The boy wanted to get home, but now down in the GeoFront he was hauled off by the good doctor. Ritsuko hadn't even let him take a shower before wrapping up his hands.  
男孩本想回家，但现在在 GeoFront 里，他被好心的医生带走了。赤木律子甚至没让他洗个澡，就急忙包扎他的双手。

He had to wait for the blonde to turn around before releasing his plugsuit. The boy could only hide the cross pendent under his leg while she worked away wrapping his hands.  
他必须等到金发女孩转身后才敢脱下插入栓服。男孩只能将十字吊坠藏在腿下，而她则忙着包扎他的双手。

Shinji knew she only wanted to do this so she could ask questions, any nurse could've done this.  
真嗣知道她这么做只是为了能问问题，任何一个护士都能胜任。

"How have you been feeling?"  
"你最近感觉怎么样？"

"Fine." "好吧。"

"Have any of your memories come back yet?" She inquired.  
"你的记忆有恢复的迹象吗？" 她询问道。"

"I have dreams sometimes."  
"我有时会做梦。"

"About what?" "关于什么？"

"School and some sort of target practice."  
"学校和某种打靶练习。"

"Do you remember training in the simulator?"  
"你还记得在模拟器里训练的事吗？"

"Only a few bits, are we all going to be able to do that at the same time?"  
"只有几块碎片，我们能同时做到吗？"

"Hmm, team exercises… I'll have to talk to Misato about that."  
"嗯，团队训练……我得和美里谈谈这件事。"

She finished wrapping his hands, to which he took his leave, holding up the lower half of his plugsuit with his hand, the pendent hiding in his grip.  
她包扎完他的手，他便告辞了，用手提着插入栓服的下半部分，吊坠藏在他的握持之中。

He didn't need that woman touching him more than was necessary.  
他不需要那个女人过多地触碰他。

Making his way to the locker-room and the showers he just stripped off the rest of his plugsuit and stood there underneath the hot water.  
他走向更衣室和淋浴间，脱掉了剩下的连体服，站在热水下。

_Of course, she was there too, she wouldn't leave him in peace. Might as well ask her what had been in the back of his mind since the Angel was defeated.  
当然，她也在那儿，她不会让他安宁的。不妨问问她，自天使被击败后，他心里一直惦记着什么。_

"Did you curl up like that, after Sahaquiel?" he asked.  
"你像那样蜷缩起来，是在萨哈奎尔之后吗？" 他问道。

"_Hmph, going to use me to woo your new toy?"_  
"哼，要用我来讨好你的新玩物吗？"

"It's not like that and you know it."  
"不是那样的，你知道的。"

"If I recall, you were the one who curled up next to me first, and how _would_ you have felt if I kissed you that night?" he asked.  
"如果我没记错，是你先蜷缩在我身边的，那晚如果我吻了你，你会怎么想？" 他问道。

"_You know exactly what I was thinking, or did you forget how you ended the world and got to find out?" She glared at him with that blue eye. that was cruel, but fair._  
"你明明知道我当时在想什么，还是说你忘了你是如何终结世界并得以发现的？" 她用那只蓝眼睛瞪着他。虽然残酷，但公平。

"I'm pretty sure you would have beaten me to death if I did anything that night." He said with a small smile, thinking back on their childish argument after Israfel.  
"我很确定，如果那晚我做了什么，你肯定会把我打死。" 他带着一丝微笑说道，回想起伊斯拉斐尔之后的幼稚争吵。

"_Probably… but that doesn't mean I wouldn't have liked it."_  
"大概……但这并不意味着我不会喜欢它。"

Finishing, he got dressed, with the pendent once again hanging around his neck.  
穿戴完毕后，他再次将吊坠挂在了脖子上。

The Third Children made his way out of the locker-room, only to find Misato there just like the last time, only now he wasn't running into her.  
第三适格者走出更衣室，却发现美里就在那里，就像上次一样，只是这次他没有撞到她。

Shinji smiled at the woman "I came back, didn't I?"  
真嗣对那位女士微笑道：“我回来了，不是吗？”

She just nodded and brought him into a hug, as if just to make sure.  
她只是点点头，将他拥入怀中，仿佛只是为了确认这一点。

Pulling back, she gave him a weak smile "I'll be home late tonight, Section 2 will make sure you get home with Asuka."  
她退后一步，露出一个虚弱的微笑：“我今晚回家会很晚，第二课会确保你和明日香一起回家。”

Shinji nodded. 真嗣点了点头。

ʡʘʘʢ

The ride home was quiet, neither of them said anything to one another, nor to the Section 2 agent who was driving them.  
回家的路上一片寂静，他们俩谁也没有对对方或驾驶的第二课特工说一句话。

Misato's apartment was clear of the flooded areas, so it didn't take much time to reach it.  
美里住的公寓没有被淹区域，所以很快就到了。

Saying thanks to the agent as Asuka went straight for the apartment, the car peeled away while he just took his time walking up.  
向经纪人道谢后，明日香径直走向公寓，车子随即驶离，而他则不紧不慢地步行上楼。

As he walked in the girl was nowhere to be found, her door was shut, and even a knock on her door was met with silence.  
当他走进去时，女孩已不见踪影，她的房门紧闭，甚至连敲门声也只换来一片寂静。

He frowned; you'd think she would be happy about killing another Angel…  
他皱起眉头；你会以为她会对杀死另一个天使感到高兴……

Going about making dinner for them, he brought his books out to the kitchen table to finish up the last bits of homework he had, while he boiled rice behind him.  
他忙着为他们准备晚餐，同时把书本拿到厨房桌上，完成剩下的作业，身后电饭煲里的米饭正在煮着。

It wasn't like it mattered, but why bring suspicion when he could already breeze through it with no problems. The time really was only in writing the answers, how many times had he been taught this or equivalent material?  
这并不重要，但既然他能轻松应对，何必招致怀疑呢？真正耗时的不过是写下答案，这些内容或其等价物，他已经被教导过多少次了？

With bits of food cooking behind him, twenty minutes later he was closing his books when a pile more slammed down next to him, causing him to jump.  
身后食物在烹饪，二十分钟后，他合上书本，旁边突然砰地一声堆下更多作业，让他吓了一跳。

He blinked only to look at redhead with closed eyes and chin up.  
他眨了眨眼，目光投向那位闭着眼、下巴微扬的红发人。

He couldn't help the small smile on his face "Mannschaft?"  
他忍不住脸上的微笑，轻声问道：“球队？”

She said nothing and just opened the first book.  
她一言不发，只是翻开了第一本书。

**I always thought it was sad we only got to see the pilots work together against one Angel in the Rebuild series, hence the chapter title.  
我一直觉得遗憾，在《新世纪福音战士》重制系列中，我们只能看到驾驶员们联手对抗一只使徒，因此有了这个chapter的标题。**

**Shoutouts! 致谢！**

**UltraSpink of Da USA- Dread it, Run From it... Honestly, it's like you want me to spoil the story for you.  
来自美国的 UltraSpink——害怕它，逃避它……说实话，你这简直像是在逼我剧透给你听。**

**Su Exodus – Thanks, hopefully I can keep up this pace, maybe 3 chapters a week is good.  
Su Exodus – 谢谢，希望我能保持这个节奏，或许每周三章是个不错的安排。**

**Akomis- Thanks, happy to point people in the direction of good music. BTW digging the Dwarf Fortress profile pic, pardon the pun.  
阿科米斯- 谢谢，很高兴能向人们推荐好音乐。顺便说一句，喜欢你的矮人要塞头像，无意冒犯，但这个双关真妙。**

**EvaPilotFair- Digging? Yes. Dark. Yes? Mysterious? Double Yes. Wise? Meh.  
EvaPilotFair- 挖掘？是的。黑暗？是的。神秘？双重肯定。智慧？一般般。**

**A Guy- Oh yeah, bring on some of that criticism, I live for that, and totally agree with what you're saying and that's the point. Here's my thought process for Kaji…  
某人- 哦耶，来点批评吧，我就是为了这个而活的，而且完全同意你的观点，这就是重点。这是我关于加持的思考过程……**

**Kaji hasn't even met Shinji once throughout this story, (no interaction when Shinji is leaving the GeoFront due to timing), he's only heard about him and found out he 'died'. So, one excuse for Kaji is the fact the boy was actually** _**dead**_ **and/or Shinji could count his 14 years before piloting an EVA as his 'previous life' considering how much of a change it is. More importantly, I wanted Misato, Ritsuko, and Kaji to each have their own way of… handling… Shinij, each of which may have their share of consequences *Stomp Stomp*.**  
在这篇故事中，加持甚至从未与真嗣见过一次面（真嗣离开地底都市时因时机不对而没有互动），他只是听说过他，并得知他‘死了’。所以，加持的一个借口是，那个男孩实际上已经死了，或者考虑到驾驶 EVA 带来的巨大变化，真嗣可以将他 14 岁之前的岁月视为他的‘前世’。更重要的是，我希望美里、律子和加持各自有他们处理……真嗣的方式，每种方式都可能带来各自的后果*跺脚跺脚*。

**Misato, is willfully ignorant to any discrepancies. Based off her reactions to not getting him back after he was stuck in an EVA for a month in NGE, imagine what she'd be like if she knew in her heart it was** _**her**_ **who got him legitimately killed, then only to get him back. She doesn't want to see the differences even if they are glaringly obvious, hence why doesn't question much as the two of them mostly get back to their 'normal' after the Sixth Angel. Even the sleepwalking she just accepts.**  
美里故意忽视任何差异。从她在碇真嗣被困在 EVA 里一个月后未能将他带回的反应来看，想象一下如果她内心深处知道是他因为她而真正死去，然后又重新回到她身边，她会是什么样子。她不想看到即使明显得不能再明显的差异，这就是为什么在第六使徒事件后，他们大多恢复了‘正常’生活，她几乎不怎么质疑。就连他的梦游症，她也只是接受而已。

**Ritsuko instead is suspicious about him coming back, and she can't comprehend it, using science to justify what happened, almost hysterically, but she doesn't know him and isn't around him enough to really know how different he truly is.  
相反，律子对他回来感到怀疑，她无法理解这一切，近乎歇斯底里地用科学来解释所发生的事情，但她并不真正了解他，也没有足够的时间在他身边，所以无法真正察觉他的不同之处。**

**Kaji has no previous interactions with the boy, only his file and (being a spy) probably a little more information than the average NERV employee. This is just their first time talking and he should at least think that EVA pilots are a bit strange judging by Rei and Asuka's behaviors. Still, the man is known to dig for info, that conversation is the catalyst for his interest in Shinji, so what happens when he tries to look into the story Shinji told him and finds nothing…  
加持与这名少年并无过往交集，仅凭他的档案以及（身为间谍）或许比一般 NERV 员工多一些的情报。这不过是他们初次交谈，单凭绫波和明日香的行为，他至少会觉得 EVA 驾驶员们有些古怪。然而，加持素以挖掘信息著称，这场对话点燃了他对真嗣的兴趣，那么当他试图深入探究真嗣所讲述的故事却一无所获时，又会发生什么呢…**

**But… I've said too much.  
但是……我说得太多了。**

**Until Next Time 下次再见**

### Chapter 15: "...What was it she did to break your heart…"  
Chapter 15: “……她究竟做了什么，让你心碎至此……”

Asuka tossed in bed. 明日香在床上辗转反侧。

The pilot of EVA Unit-02 couldn't sleep, it wasn't like this was abnormal, but this time there was something else on her mind.  
EVA 二号机的驾驶员无法入睡，这种情况并不罕见，但这次她的心中有别的事情萦绕。

She looked over at her clock, 11:02. When they got back, she was tired and had gone straight to her room, but she couldn't sleep. She hadn't feel like doing much of anything really.  
她瞥了一眼时钟，11 点 02 分。他们回来后，她感到疲惫，直接回到了自己的房间，却无法入眠。她真的什么都不想做。

The Second Child had heard that knock and she felt the faintest longing to answer, to open the door and talk, but she couldn't bring herself to do it.  
这位二号适格者听到了敲门声，她心中涌起一丝想要回应、开门交谈的渴望，但她无法让自己这么做。

Then, going out for dinner, she had seen him there, working away, like nothing had happened that day. Even with those bandaged hands he worked on his homework like it was nothing.  
然后，外出用餐时，她看到他在那里埋头苦干，仿佛那天什么都没发生过。即使双手缠着绷带，他依然像没事一样继续做作业。

Asuka decided that maybe… just this once… she'd ask for something.  
明日香决定，或许……就这一次……她会开口请求些什么。

So, she got her homework, even as she saw him starting to put away his own. The girl thought she missed her moment, that Shinji wouldn't want to help her with her kanji.  
于是，她拿出自己的作业，尽管看到他已经开始收拾自己的。女孩以为她错过了时机，认为真嗣不会愿意帮她练习汉字了。

But the boy had just smiled, and as he brought out the food, he helped guide her through the writings over dinner.  
但那男孩只是微笑着，当他拿出食物时，他帮助她在晚餐时引导她理解那些文字。

He hadn't berated her, he hadn't laughed at her lack of skill, he hadn't pushed her to be better.  
他没有责备她，没有嘲笑她的技艺不足，也没有强迫她变得更好。

No. 不。

He had just helped her, guided her with the grace of a world class teacher and ask for nothing in return.  
他刚刚帮助了她，以世界级教师的优雅引导她，却不求任何回报。

And that bothered her. 这让她感到困扰。

Now she was just lying there, tossing, and turning trying to at least sleep, to run away from these feelings into her unpleasant dreams.  
现在她只是躺在那里，辗转反侧，试图至少能入睡，逃离这些情感，躲进她不愉快的梦境中。

Rolling onto her back, she peered up at the sky out her window, the blinking of a single lone plane the only movement she could see.  
她翻身仰躺，透过窗户凝视着天空，唯有一架孤独的飞机闪烁着灯光，是她视野中唯一的动态。

"I've never… not been alone, it's all I know… so why do I feel like this?" she whispered to herself in the darkness.  
“我从未……不曾孤单，这是我所知的全部……可为何我会如此感觉？”她在黑暗中低声自语。

She got up, her feet making no noise as she crept through the house, her destination known.  
她起身，悄无声息地穿过屋子，目标明确。

What was she doing?! 她在做什么？！

There she was standing in front of his door.  
她就站在他门前。

A knock? No, if he was asleep it wouldn't matter.  
敲门？不，如果他在睡觉，那也没关系。

Asuka just opened it, there he was, on his side facing away from her.  
明日香刚打开门，就看到他侧身躺着，背对着她。

Why was his room so messy? For a boy who did nothing but clean the apartment, she couldn't understand why his own room would look like this, it was worse than her own.  
为什么他的房间这么乱？一个除了打扫公寓什么都不做的男孩，她无法理解为什么他的房间会变成这样，比她自己的还要糟糕。

Sliding the door shut behind her, it was quiet, the only sound being his light breathing.  
她轻轻地关上门，四周一片寂静，唯一的声音是他轻柔的呼吸声。

Then she laid down. 然后她躺下了。

Her back barely touched his, but the instant she laid down she knew he wasn't asleep by the sharp intake of his breath.  
她的背几乎还没碰到他的，但就在她躺下的那一刻，她就知道他没睡着，因为他突然急促地吸了一口气。

"Just turn back around," she whispered, no begged, he didn't move "will you just let me lie here for a while?"  
“就转过身来吧，”她轻声说，不，是乞求，他没有动，“你能让我就这样躺一会儿吗？”

Gott she was pathetic. 天啊，她真是可怜。

Begging the boy to stay facing away from her. Isn't that why she came here, what was it she wanted?  
恳求男孩背对着她留下。她来这里不就是为了这个吗，她究竟想要什么？

To not be alone? 不想孤单一人？

Then why did she want him to keep facing away?  
那她为什么又希望他继续背对着她？

For a moment nothing happened, then Asuka froze.  
一时间什么也没发生，接着明日香僵住了。

That boy, that idiot turned over, she could hear the ruffle of sheets as he brought himself to his other side.  
那个男孩，那个傻瓜翻了个身，她能听到床单的摩擦声，他把自己挪到了另一侧。

A weight found itself on her side, then lazily around her waist and over on her stomach. Shinji's bandaged hand rested on her; he wasn't pressed up against her back. No, he was still away from her, but the hand… why?  
一股重量压在了她身侧，随后懒洋洋地环绕过她的腰间，又覆上了她的腹部。真嗣缠着绷带的手搭在她身上；他没有紧贴着她的背。不，他依然与她保持着距离，但那只手……为何？

Was he trying to cop a feel? Could she have been wrong and he really was just like every other boy?  
他是在试图占便宜吗？会不会是她误会了，他其实和其他男孩没什么两样？

No, the hand just rested over her, his wrist on her waist and dangled down lightly touching her stomach, it was a message.  
不，那只手只是轻轻搭在她身上，手腕搁在她的腰间，手指微微垂下触碰着她的腹部，这是一种讯息。

"Asuka?" “明日香？”

The girl made herself make a vomiting noise, maybe that would drive him away.  
女孩故意发出呕吐的声音，或许这样能把他赶走。

She was pathetic. 她真是可悲。

"You know you should really refer to me as Captain." She said in a hushed voice.  
“你知道，你真该叫我一声队长。”她压低声音说道。

She could practically see him smile at her jab.  
她几乎能看见他对着她的讽刺微笑。

"I guess you can call me Asuka though, only if I get to call you stupid Shinji…"  
"我想你可以叫我明日香，不过前提是我能叫你笨蛋真嗣……"

"Why do you pilot the EVA?"  
"你为什么要驾驶 EVA？"

"Stupid question, I clearly picked the right name for you." She spat, but she still wouldn't remove his hand.  
"真是个蠢问题，看来我给你起的名儿没错。" 她啐了一口，但仍未移开他的手。

"I pilot the EVA because I want to."  
"我驾驶 EVA 是因为我想这么做。"

"hmm" "嗯"

"What about you, why do you do it?"  
"那你呢，你为什么这么做？"

His breathing stopped, she waited for the answer, but the silence… it was deafening.  
他的呼吸停止了，她等待着回答，但那沉默……震耳欲聋。

"I don't really know." “我真的不知道。”

Of anything he could have said, _that_ answer annoyed her.  
他本可以说任何话，但这个回答让她感到恼火。

"Don't be an idiot, you just don't want to admit the reason to yourself." she growled.  
"别犯傻了，你只是不想对自己承认那个理由。" 她咆哮道。

"I guess you're right…" he said, confusing her.  
"我想你是对的……" 他说，这让她感到困惑。

"I used to pilot… for a different reason, now… it's like it's the only place that…"  
"我以前驾驶……出于不同的理由，现在……仿佛那是我唯一能……"

"feels right…" she said, thinking that she was completing his answer.  
"感觉对了……" 她轻声说道，心中觉得这正补全了他的回答。

"Yes…" "是的……"

"and no…" "也不是……"

"Of course it feels right idiot, everyone loves what they're good at." She said with a flare, the German couldn't help but question if that was for herself or for him.  
“当然感觉对了，傻瓜，人们都喜欢自己擅长的事。”她带着一丝炫耀说道，这让德国人忍不住怀疑这话是说给她自己听的，还是说给他听的。

"I don't…" “我不……”

He was silent, but his bandaged hand on her stomach seemed tense, as if it were now making sure to keep her from bolting away.  
他沉默了，但他那只缠着绷带的手放在她肚子上，显得很紧张，仿佛现在正努力确保她不会逃走。

She _almost_ liked that. 她几乎喜欢这样。

"You're beating yourself up over today." He said to her in a hushed voice, little more than a whisper, but it was a statement, not a question.  
"你因为今天的事情在自责。" 他用几乎只有耳语的声音对她说，尽管这是一个陈述，而非疑问。

"Yes." She breathed out. "是的。" 她轻声叹息。

A pain, a dull pain in her chest.  
一阵痛楚，胸口隐隐作痛。

But a weight off her shoulders.  
但卸下了肩上的重担。

"You don't rely on anyone." He whispered right behind her.  
"你从不依赖任何人。" 他在她耳后低语。

Her heart rate quickened, with a warmth growing in her chest.  
她的心跳加速，胸中涌起一股暖意。

Another statement of fact.  
又是一句事实陈述。

"Yes." Another breath. "是的。" 他又深吸了一口气。

"I tried that," he said, it almost sounded like a confession to a priest, one of shame "I tried to be alone once…"  
"我试过，" 他说，那几乎像是对神父的忏悔，带着羞愧，"我曾试图独自一人……"

She couldn't help herself, she had to hear.  
她情不自禁，她必须听下去。

"What happened?" was that a bit of desperation in her voice?  
“发生了什么？”她的声音里是否带着一丝绝望？

Asuka heard him take a breath and hold it.  
明日香听到他深吸一口气，然后屏住了呼吸。

For a few seconds he said nothing, was he trying to remember, was he trying to come up with a lie for her?  
有那么几秒钟，他一言不发，是在努力回忆，还是在为她编织谎言？

Then he said something she hadn't expected.  
随后他说了些她未曾预料的话。

"The nightmares weren't worth it." He said quietly.  
“那些噩梦不值得。”他平静地说。

She rolled over faster than she cared to admit, his arm still on her side, now reaching behind her to her lower back.  
她翻身的速度快得连自己都不愿承认，他的手臂仍搭在她身侧，此刻正伸向她的后腰。

Now they were inches apart, face to face, in the darkness she couldn't see his face well, even though her eyes had adjusted to the lack of light.  
现在他们相距仅几英寸，面对面，在黑暗中她看不清他的脸，尽管她的眼睛已经适应了光线不足。

But he was there. 但他就在那里。

"Do they go away, the nightmares?" she asked, no pleaded, like he had some power over her dreams.  
"那些噩梦会消失吗？" 她问道，不，是恳求道，仿佛他有能力左右她的梦境。

She wanted to hear the answer so badly that the thought hadn't even occurred to her that she _herself_ was admitting to having that exact problem.  
她如此渴望听到答案，以至于根本没有意识到自己在承认这个确切的问题。

He said nothing, he just looked at her for a moment, like he was trying to see something.  
他什么也没说，只是看了她一会儿，仿佛在试图看透什么。

"You're not alone Asuka." He whispered, they were inches apart, their hot breath poring over each other like a lazy summer breeze.  
"你并不孤单，明日香。" 他低语道，两人相距仅几英寸，炽热的呼吸交织在一起，宛如慵懒的夏日微风。

She noted the minty smell… he brushed his teeth well.  
她注意到那股薄荷味……他刷牙刷得很仔细。

"I need to be." She said desperately trying to convince him or was it herself?  
"我必须这样。" 她急切地说，试图说服他，还是说服自己？

"I know you're not because you have me." He said, no offered.  
"我知道你不是，因为你还有我。" 他说，不是提供，而是存在。

He was reaching out to her, this was him offering something more than just a passing acquaintance to her, that's what this was.  
他在向她伸出援手，这不仅仅是萍水相逢，他在向她提供更多，这就是此刻的意义。

Her heart skipped a beat, suddenly it felt like her chest was going to explode.  
她的心跳漏了一拍，突然间，她感觉自己的胸口仿佛要炸裂开来。

Isn't that what she wanted, that's why she came here!?  
那不就是她想要的吗，所以她才来这里的！？

"I know..." “我知道...”

"**What do you know!?**." She snapped at him, what did he understand, what right did he have saying that just so he could use her like any other boy would?  
“你知道什么！？”她对他厉声说道，他懂什么，他有什么权利那样说，就为了像其他男孩一样利用她？

Half of her had wanted him to finish that sentence, the other half had recoiled in fear, not even daring to let him make a connection. That part of her had been so dominant for so long that it was only instinctual at this point.  
她的一半希望他能完成那句话，而另一半却因恐惧而退缩，甚至不敢让他建立任何联系。那部分的她已经主导了太久，以至于现在只是一种本能。

That part of her whispered in her mind that this was all an act to get to her, to destroy her, and she was falling right into his trap.  
她心中的那部分低语着，这一切都是为了接近她、摧毁她而演的戏，而她正一步步落入他的圈套。

She broke free of his arm, not that he was actually trying to keep her there, and got up.  
她挣脱了他的手臂，并非他真的想留住她，然后站了起来。

The Second Child didn't need his fake understanding, she had gotten this far on her own.  
次子不需要他那虚假的理解，她靠自己已经走到了这一步。

She didn't need _him_. 她并不需要他。

Part of Asuka's mind knew all she was doing was running away, and she hated herself for it.  
明日香的一部分心智明白她只是在逃避，这让她对自己感到厌恶。

He said nothing as she got up, but she could feel his eyes on the back of her head.  
她起身时他一言不发，但她能感觉到他的目光落在她的后脑勺上。

Practically ripping the door open, she left his room, going straight across the hall and into her own.  
她几乎是猛地拉开房门，径直穿过走廊，回到了自己的房间。

.

.

.

The boy felt empty, maybe… maybe he had tried too hard this time.  
男孩感到空虚，或许……或许这次他努力过头了。

_Behind him he heard the booming laughter of another redhead.  
他身后传来了另一个红发人的洪亮笑声。_

"_Congrats Baka, I take it back, the girl's pretty smart if she just did that!"_  
"恭喜啊，笨蛋，我收回之前的话，那女孩要是真那么做了，确实挺聪明的！"

"_Looks like you'll make it through this one alive!" Soryu shouted at the other redhead, despite the knowledge that she'd never be heard._  
"看来你能活着挺过这一关了！" 索留对着另一个红发女孩大喊，尽管她知道对方根本听不见。"

Getting up and closing the door after her, Shinji turned to look at the mess that was his room.  
起身关上门后，真嗣转头看向自己那凌乱不堪的房间。

Closing his eyes, he just stood there, leaning slightly against the door.  
他闭上眼睛，只是站在那里，微微倚靠着门。

Memories of a rejected world forced their way into his mind.  
被拒绝的世界的记忆强行涌入他的脑海。

_A kitchen that wasn't real, scolding coffee running down his arm.  
一个不真实的厨房，滚烫的咖啡顺着他的手臂流淌。_

_Help me! 救救我！_

_Don't leave me alone! 别丢下我一个人！_

_Don't abandon me! 不要抛弃我！_

No! 不！

He didn't deserve that… he didn't deserve anything from anyone.  
他不配得到这些……他从任何人那里都不配得到任何东西。

Especially her. 尤其是她。

Opening his eyes, he walked to the dresser in the corner, opening the top drawer he shifted through clothes until he got to the back only to see Misato's scratched and stained pendent and a dusty SDAT player.  
睁开眼睛，他走到角落的梳妆台前，打开最上面的抽屉，翻找着衣物，直到在后面发现了美里那磨损且沾满污渍的吊坠和一个积满灰尘的 SDAT 播放器。

_She was still laughing, but it wasn't right in his ears, it was disingenuous, almost how a fake laugh would sound.  
她仍在笑，但那笑声在他耳中并不真实，显得虚伪，几乎像是假笑一般。_

"_Thought you could just wrap her in your arms, and everything would be ok dummkopf? Oh that was great!"_  
“以为你只需将她拥入怀中，一切就会好起来，傻瓜？哦，那真是太棒了！”

Picking it up the player, he felt nothing as he untangled the wires and put the buds in his ears with shaking hands.  
他拿起播放器，颤抖着手解开线缆，将耳机塞入耳中，心中却毫无波澜。

_Only one thing could really drown her out.  
只有一件事能真正让她安静下来。_

How long had it been since he'd last listened to this thing?  
他上一次听这东西，已经过去多久了？

His bandaged finger trembled as it hovered over the play button, part of him was screaming to rip off the earbuds, throw the thing back in the drawer and lay back down.  
他包扎着的手指颤抖着悬停在播放键上，内心的一部分在尖叫，让他扯下耳机，把这东西扔回抽屉，然后躺回去。

This was ok, he was ok.  
这样还好，他没事。

If he did this, he knew what it meant, he knew exactly where this road led.  
如果他这么做，他知道这意味着什么，他清楚这条路会通向何方。

And he didn't know if he would be able to turn around again.  
而他不知道自己是否还能再次转身。

*Click* *咔嚓*

ʡʘʘʢ

_That battlefield was hazy, smoke rose off the smoldering remains of any organic life here, the detonation of a few dozen N2 mines tended to do that.  
那片战场朦胧不清，烟雾从这里所有有机生命的余烬中升起，几十颗 N2 地雷的爆炸往往会带来这样的景象。_

_The JSDF always did love blowing NERV wide open.  
日本自卫队总是喜欢把 NERV 彻底击溃。_

_But_ them_?_ 但他们呢？

_How could he ever think it would be them…  
他怎么可能认为会是他们……_

_Shinji leaned down to pick up his weapon.  
真嗣弯下腰去捡起他的武器。_

_The blue head of EVA Unit-00 stuck to its end, flicking the axe, the gore and LCL spray of its internal fluids shot out in a trail as it crashed into the ground.  
EVA 初号机的蓝色头部紧贴着末端，挥动着斧头，内部液体混合着 LCL 喷溅而出，形成一道轨迹，随后重重地撞击在地面上。_

_In the haze he saw movement, the slightest outline of another figure.  
在朦胧中，他瞥见了移动的影子，隐约勾勒出另一具身影的轮廓。_

_Gripping the axe handle tighter, he could now tell the EVA was charred, but it wasn't out of commission, its paint had been blasted away by the N2 explosion, leaving only black and grey.  
他更紧地握住斧柄，现在可以清楚地看到 EVA 机体被烧焦，但并未失去作战能力，其涂装已被 N2 爆炸剥离，只剩下黑与灰。_

_It saw him, and it charged.  
它看见了他，便冲了上去。_

_He readied himself, bracing for the impact, but it was no use, he was thrown back into the wall of the GeoFront, his axe torn from his grip.  
他做好了准备，紧绷着身体等待撞击，但这一切都是徒劳，他被猛地甩向了地底都市的墙壁，手中的斧头也被震飞了。_

_He shook his head, trying to clear his thoughts.  
他摇了摇头，试图理清思绪。_

"_Stay. Down." He heard her growl._  
“待着，别动。”他听到她的低吼。

_Looking up at Unit-02, he couldn't fight her; he wouldn't hurt her.  
抬头望着二号机，他无法与她对抗；他不愿伤害她。_

"_Asuka, I understand, I understand you want this, more than you know!"_  
"明日香，我明白，我明白你比任何人都渴望这个！"

"_**What do you know**__!?" she barked as her EVA ran towards Unit-01._  
""你知道什么！？"" 她咆哮着，她的 EVA 向零一号机冲去。

"_He said I could see mama again, that's all that matters!" she yelled as Unit-02s fists impacted with his own EVA._  
""他说我能再次见到妈妈，这才是最重要的！"" 她喊道，零二号机的拳头击中了他自己的 EVA。

_Grabbing Unit-01 around the neck, she twisted and threw him towards the center of the GeoFront, charred earth flying everywhere as he skipped across the ground.  
她紧紧抓住零一机体的脖子，扭身将其甩向 GeoFront 的中心，烧焦的泥土四处飞溅，零一机体在地面上弹跳着滑行。_

"_Asuka, he's lying, it's not what you think it is, trust me." He was begging, what was he supposed to do? He couldn't fight her, not after what he had done to her._  
“明日香，他在撒谎，事情不是你想的那样，相信我。”他恳求着，该怎么办呢？他无法与她对抗，尤其是在他那样对待她之后。

"_ShutupShutupShutup!" She screamed as she brought out her progressive knife, moving towards him._  
“闭嘴闭嘴闭嘴！”她尖叫着拔出高频刀，向他逼近。

"_I won't fight you Asuka, I made you a promise." He pleaded, pushing himself up to one knee.  
"我不会和你打的，明日香，我答应过你。" 他恳求着，挣扎着单膝跪起。  
"Don't you remember?" "你不记得了吗？"_

"_Fine…." She growled, stopping in her tracks as a shadow passed over the two of them "you won't have to."_  
"好吧……" 她咆哮道，脚步一顿，一道阴影掠过两人头顶，"你不必动手了。"

_Shinji's heart fell at the realization, looking up he stared at the six figures swirling above him. All six of the production Evangelions circled in the sky like vultures drawn to a carcass.  
意识到这一点，真嗣的心沉了下去，他抬头望向那六个旋转的身影。六架量产型福音战士在天空中盘旋，宛如被尸体吸引的秃鹫。_

_It was as if a bolt of lightning struck him, he couldn't even react as his gut was pierced by one of their dark spears.  
仿佛一道闪电击中了他，他甚至来不及反应，腹部就被其中一支黑暗的长矛刺穿。_

_So, this was what it felt like…  
原来，这就是这种感觉……_

_This is what she felt…  
这就是她的感受……_

_He looked down at the gaping hole in his stomach, blood pumping out into the LCL, a red cloud pouring out of him, beginning to encompass his body inside the entry plug.  
他低头看着自己腹部那个裂开的大洞，鲜血涌出，融入 LCL 中，一团红色云雾从他体内喷涌而出，开始包围他在插入栓内的身体。_

His specter just came around in front of him and peered at the hole in his chest. That blue eye showing a sense of understanding.  
他的幽灵刚刚出现在他面前，凝视着他胸口的洞。那只蓝色的眼睛流露出一种理解的神情。

Perhaps there was a bit of humanity to her after all.  
或许她终究还是有那么一丝人性的。

_Grabbing the spear with the left arm of his EVA to steady himself, the Third Children looked back up to Unit-02.  
他用 EVA 的左臂稳住长矛，第三适格者再次抬头望向二号机。_

_How had it come to this?  
事情怎么会变成这样？_

_How could she be in this much pain to want this?  
她怎会痛到想要这样？_

_Reaching out his arm to Unit-02, the blood loss and pain was starting to cloud his mind.  
伸出胳膊去够二号机，失血和疼痛开始模糊他的意识。_

I'll save you. 我会救你。

_Two 二_

I'll save you. 我会救你。

_Three 三_

I'll save... 我会拯救...

_Four 四_

I'll… 我会…

"_Asuka," he breathed as another spear went through him, he couldn't even bring himself to scream, he earned this._  
“明日香，”他喘息着，又一柄长矛穿透了他，他甚至无力尖叫，这是他应得的。

"_please be happy." he managed to whisper to her, as the last spear flew down from the heavens, finally turning his world to black._  
“请一定要幸福。”他竭力对她低语，随着最后一支长矛从天而降，他的世界终于陷入黑暗。

**Oh you thought we were going to be** _**happy**_**? Have a nice scene between our two favorite characters? Ha! This Evangelion, we're talking about. Seriously there are some chapters that I want to just get out right when I think of them, this was one. So you all get a double header this weekend. It just kinda popped into my head, 'What if Asuka wanted to see her Mother so badly that she assisted in Instrumentality or at least was working with SEELE because of it?'.**  
哦，你以为我们会幸福吗？会有我们最喜欢的两个角色之间的美好场景吗？哈！我们在谈论的是《新世纪福音战士》。说真的，有些章节我一想到就想立刻写出来，这一章就是。所以这周末你们会得到双份更新。这个念头突然就蹦进了我的脑海，‘如果明日香如此渴望见到她的母亲，以至于她协助了人类补完计划，或者至少是因为这个原因与 SEELE 合作呢？’。

**Shoutouts 致谢**

**Big Fan of Story- Thanks, I hope you enjoyed the chapter.  
故事爱好者 - 谢谢，希望你喜欢《chapter》。**

**Ultraspinkofdausa- We're all cursed with knowledge that's one of the great things about time travel stories. Destiny still arrives, or should I say the** _**Author**_ **does. The hardest writing choices require the strongest wills, after all who wants to see Shinji suffer more…**  
Ultraspinkofdausa - 我们都背负着那些知识，这是时间旅行故事的魅力之一。命运依旧降临，或者我应该说，是作者做到了。最难的写作选择需要最坚定的意志，毕竟，谁愿意看到真嗣再受苦呢……

**RandomFanFicFan- Made sense to me, Gendo is just manipulating Shinji there, and the boy can see though the bullshit (mostly). Thanks for the compliment, I feel like everyone already knows what things look like, they should have seen the canon material, plus the story just gets bogged down with it, no one wants to read a wall of text, not that it cant be a good wall of text.  
RandomFanFicFan- 对我来说很有道理，碇源堂只是在操纵真嗣，而那孩子能看穿那些胡扯（大部分时候）。谢谢你的夸奖，我觉得大家应该都已经知道事情的模样了，他们应该看过原作材料，而且故事如果充斥着这些内容，只会变得拖沓，没人想读一大段文字，尽管那可能是一段精彩的文字。**

**James Birdsong- Thanks a lot, hopefully you enjoy the rest.  
James Birdsong- 非常感谢，希望你喜欢接下来的部分。**

**I think I need to clear up what '2-3 chapters' a week means; I've already written the story up to a specific point. All I'm doing is proofing it and adding/rearranging certain things that I want, or editing it for changes that I've made. So, I'm not writing a full chapter every time I've upload. When I hit the end of that stretch I've written up to, I'll take a break just to write the next bit and do the same thing over again. That being said I do have a bit of work on my hands with the next 5-6 chapters so it might be a few days until the next chapter.  
我想我需要澄清一下‘每周 2-3 章’的含义；我已经写到了故事的某个特定点。我所做的只是校对并添加/调整我想要的东西，或者根据我做出的改动进行编辑。所以，每次上传时我并不是在写一个完整的chapter。当我写到我已经写到的那个部分时，我会休息一下，去写接下来的部分，然后重复同样的过程。话虽如此，我手头还有接下来的 5-6 章的工作，所以可能要过几天才能上传chapter。**

**Until Next Time. 下次再会。**

### Chapter 16: "...I couldn't face a life without your lights …"  
Chapter 16: "……我无法面对没有你光芒的生活……"

Three o'clock in the morning, damn that had to be a record.  
凌晨三点，该死的，这绝对创纪录了。

Misato thanked whatever was watching over her that she didn't crash her car, as she dragged herself into the apartment. She'd go in late tomorrow, grab an extra hour of sleep, and that would be that.  
美里感谢着冥冥中的守护，庆幸自己没有撞车，拖着疲惫的身躯走进了公寓。她打算明天晚点去上班，多睡一个小时，就这样吧。

Cleaning up half of Tokyo 3 that was flooded wasn't exactly an easy thing to deal with after all.  
毕竟，清理被淹没的东京第三区的一半可不是件容易的事。

Being as quiet as she could, the colonel entered the kitchen and pulled a nice cold beer from the fridge, it'd help her sleep after all.  
上校尽可能轻手轻脚地走进厨房，从冰箱里拿出一瓶冰镇啤酒，毕竟这能帮助她入睡。

She forwent a shower, if she didn't get one in the morning, she'd take one down in the GeoFront.  
她放弃了洗澡，如果早上没洗，她会在 GeoFront 那边洗。

Her eyes sagged as shuffled to her room, cracking the beer and chugging half of it, all her mind was focused on was just feel that sweet mattress.  
她拖着沉重的眼皮走向房间，打开啤酒，一口气喝掉一半，满脑子只想感受那张舒适的床垫。

The door was already open, but she thought nothing of it till she flicked on one of the lights as found him there.  
门已经开着，但直到她打开一盏灯，才发现他在那里。

Shinji, curled up, his limbs tensed, muscles bulging against his skin. The Third Child's face was scrunched like he was in some terrible pain, and for some reason his SDAT player laid next to him.  
真嗣蜷缩着，四肢紧绷，肌肉在他的皮肤下鼓起。第三适格者的脸皱成一团，仿佛正遭受着某种剧烈的痛苦，不知为何，他的 SDAT 播放器躺在他身边。

If she didn't know the boy, she would have thought he was having some sort of seizure.  
如果她不认识这个男孩，她可能会以为他正在发作某种癫痫。

Instantly she was awake, adrenaline snapped her out of her sleepiness and her beer was sent flying somewhere into the mess that was her room.  
她立刻清醒过来，肾上腺素让她摆脱了睡意，手中的啤酒不知飞到了房间的哪个角落，那里早已是一片狼藉。

Her brain begged that this was another sleep walking episode and despite her knowing what might happen to her, she rushed down to grab him.  
她的脑海中恳求着这不过是又一次梦游发作，尽管明知可能遭遇什么，她还是急忙冲下去抓住他。

Latching onto his wrists and steadying him on his back, the face he was making was worse that when he had been injured piloting.  
她紧紧抓住他的手腕，稳住他的身体，他脸上的表情比他驾驶时受伤还要糟糕。

"Shinji!" “真嗣！”

It hadn't taken much to wake him up, his eyes snapped open to her, and instead of fighting as he had the first time, he lunged at her, not to hurt her, but embrace her.  
唤醒他并不费力，他的双眼猛地睁开，直视着她，这一次他没有像初次那样反抗，而是扑向她，不是为了伤害，而是为了拥抱她。

She didn't even know what to do, she had always been the one who had given him a hug first, with him only returning the affection.  
她甚至不知道该做什么，一直以来都是她先给他一个拥抱，而他只是回以同样的温情。

Now he was holding onto her, like she was some raft in the middle of the ocean, the only thing keeping him from drowning.  
现在他紧紧拥抱着她，仿佛她是汪洋中的一块浮木，是唯一让他免于沉溺的东西。

Despite his action there were no tears, no sobs, just the occasional muscle twitch.  
尽管他有所动作，却没有泪水，没有抽泣，只是偶尔肌肉抽搐。

She didn't even bother to ask about his dreams, she was sure he wouldn't tell her about it, just as he always did.  
她甚至懒得问他的梦，她确信他不会告诉她，就像他一贯的做法。

But that was alright, he was fine, he was here, and with that heart that she could feel pounding away in his chest he was alive.  
但那没关系，他很好，他在这里，而她能感受到他胸中那颗心脏有力地跳动着，他活着。

For minutes they just stayed like that, before he pulled away from her and looked around.  
几分钟里，他们就那样静静地待着，直到他离开她的怀抱，环顾四周。

"You got home pretty late." He said, his voice uneven, seemingly trying to ignore what had just happened.  
"你回家挺晚的。" 他说，声音有些不稳，似乎在试图忽略刚刚发生的事。

She just shrugged, not minding his redirection.  
她只是耸了耸肩，并不介意他的转移话题。

"Long night… for both of us." He said softly.  
“长夜漫漫……对我们俩都是。”他轻声说道。

"Yeah," he said, running a hand through his hair.  
“嗯，”他说着，伸手捋了捋头发。

For a few more moments he said nothing, and she couldn't bring herself to break the silence between them.  
他又沉默了片刻，她无法让自己打破他们之间的寂静。

"I'll get back to my room now."  
“我现在回房间了。”

"All right Shinji," Misato said softly allowing them to leave.  
“好吧，真嗣，”美里轻声说道，允许他们离开。

Neither of them saw the redhead peering out from the other side of the apartment.  
他们俩都没注意到红发女孩正从公寓的另一侧窥视着。

ʡʘʘʢ

Misato yawned as she sat at the table, groggily eating the food left out by the only person in the apartment who knew how to cook.  
Misato 坐在桌前打了个哈欠，迷迷糊糊地吃着公寓里唯一会做饭的人留下的食物。

Asuka sat there alongside her, lazily picking apart what the Third Child had made for them.  
明日香坐在她旁边，懒洋洋地拆解着第三适格者为他们准备的食物。

Shinji took the time that the girls had abandoned the shower and proceeded to get himself ready for the day.  
趁着女孩们离开了浴室，真嗣抓紧时间为自己准备新的一天。

Misato couldn't help but notice the behavior of the two, no comments, no jabs, nothing.  
美里忍不住注意到两人的行为，没有评论，没有嘲讽，什么都没有。

She would have thought the morning peaceful if she didn't know any better. She half expected Asuka to complain about some fight they had the night before, but it never came.  
如果她不那么了解情况，她本会认为这个早晨是宁静的。她半期待着明日香会抱怨昨晚他们之间的争吵，但那抱怨始终没有到来。

Finally, the redhead spoke up.  
终于，红发少女开口了。

"So where were you two when I killed the seventh Angel?"  
“那么，我击败第七使徒时，你们俩在哪儿？”

Misato blinked, maybe it was unexpected question, morning drowsiness or a combination of the two, but the question didn't register.  
美里眨了眨眼，或许是这个问题出乎意料，或是晨困使然，又或是两者兼有，总之她一时没反应过来。

"What?" “什么？”

The redhead picked at her food in annoyance at having to repeat herself "After I killed the seventh Angel, Shinji told me you two had visited someone."  
红发女子不悦地拨弄着食物，因为不得不重复自己的话：“在我击退第七使徒后，真嗣告诉我你们俩去拜访了某个人。”

"Oh, I must have missed that."  
"哦，我一定是错过了那部分。"

"You speak German!" "你会说德语！"

"Well I wasn't expecting you two to start talking so... fast!" she exclaimed, it had been rather sudden when the boy spoke to her in German.  
"我没想到你们俩会这么快就开始用...这么快的速度交谈！" 她惊呼道，男孩突然用德语和她说话确实相当突然。

Misato sighed, should she even tell Asuka, was that something Shinji should do? Was it any of her business anyways?  
美里叹了口气，她是否应该告诉明日香，这是否是真嗣应该做的事情？毕竟，这关她什么事呢？

She was the one who forced him to go after all… well not quiet, even if she was under orders, the woman was sure that they would have made the journey.  
毕竟是他逼他去的……好吧，也不完全是，尽管她是奉命行事，但美里确信他们还是会踏上这段旅程。

"We went to a cemetery." she said quietly.  
“我们去了一个墓地。”她轻声说道。

"What, the daddy's boy went to see his Grammy?" Asuka sneered.  
"什么，那个爸爸的乖宝宝去看他奶奶了？" 明日香嘲讽道。

Misato looked down at her food, her appetite suddenly vanishing. "Asuka..."  
美里低头看着自己的食物，食欲突然消失了。"明日香……"

"I bet he cried…" "我打赌他哭了……"

The colonel frowned at the girl's attitude, she hadn't exactly been peaceful with Shinji since they first met, but this was something else.  
上校对女孩的态度皱起了眉头，自从他们第一次见面以来，她对真嗣并不算友好，但这次情况不同。

"Why do you think Shinji lives with me?" she asked, no longer eating.  
“你认为真嗣为什么和我住在一起？”她问道，不再进食。

Asuka rolled her eyes and put her own utensils down.  
明日香翻了个白眼，放下了自己的餐具。

"Because we're supposed to be 'harmonizing." she muttered with the air quotes.  
"因为我们得'和谐相处'。" 她带着引号的手势咕哝道。

"He lived with me before you got here."  
"他之前和我住在一起，你来之前。"

"Why? His father is the director of NERV you'd think the kid would have premier housing." She grumbled.  
"为什么？他父亲可是 NERV 的指挥官，我还以为这孩子会住最好的房子呢。" 她抱怨道。

"Shinji hasn't lived with his father in years." Misato said with a hint of sadness in her voice. The memory of her own transgressions with her own father suddenly finding their way to the surface.  
"真嗣已经多年没有和他父亲一起生活了。" 美里带着一丝悲伤的语气说道。她与自己父亲之间的过往突然涌上心头。

"What his mommy couldn't handle the stress of living in Tokyo-3?"  
"难道他妈妈承受不了在第三新东京市生活的压力吗？"

Misato leaned forward. _That_ comment she would not tolerate.  
美里向前倾身。这种评论她绝不容忍。

"Shinji's mother was a founding member of NERV… you arrived on the anniversary of her death." Those words came out as if she were delivering them to an underling in the GeoFront and Asuka slunk back as if she were one.  
“真嗣的母亲是 NERV 的创始人之一……你抵达的那天正是她的忌日。”这些话从她口中说出，仿佛是在对地底都市的下属下达命令，而明日香则像被驯服般退缩了。

"Oh." “哦。”

ʡʘʘʢ

He had been quiet the entire walk to school, he had been quiet the entire class and since when did he listen to music.  
他在去学校的路上一直沉默不语，整堂课也是静悄悄的，他什么时候开始听音乐了？

Even the stooges seemed a bit taken back by the fact he had an SDAT player with him.  
就连那些跟班们似乎也被他随身带着 SDAT 播放器的事实给惊到了。

Lunch came, and only then did the girl realize, she didn't have anything.  
午餐时间到了，女孩这才意识到，她什么都没有带。

Had he actually made lunch for her this morning? She hadn't really noticed, the girl had eaten the breakfast he prepared and went to get ready, after all he had done it since she got there, it wasn't like she made her own.  
难道他今天早上真的为她准备了午餐？她并没有注意到，毕竟女孩吃了他准备的早餐就去准备自己了，毕竟自从她来到这里，他一直这么做，她并没有自己准备。

Toji went off to get his own food, while Kensuke joined him. Asuka watched as the Third Child went and pulled out food for himself and another.  
冬二去拿自己的食物，真嗣也跟着他。明日香看着第三适格者走过去，为自己和另一个人取出食物。

She breathed a sigh of relief, she wasn't going to have to starve for the rest of the day, but it wasn't that simple.  
她松了一口气，看来今天不用饿肚子了，但事情并没有那么简单。

The Second Child thought he was bringing it to her, if she had bothered to move her seat next to him it would have only taken an outstretched arm, but he instead stopped short of her seat, standing next to a certain bluenette.  
第二适格者以为他是要拿给她，如果她费心挪到他旁边坐下，只需伸出手就能拿到，但他却在她的座位前停了下来，站在某个蓝发女孩旁边。

Asuka couldn't hear what he said, but the First Child defiantly thanked the boy, much to her surprise.  
明日香听不清他说了什么，但这位第一适格者却出乎意料地向那男孩道了谢，让她大吃一惊。

When he went back to his seat and didn't get back up that was the final straw for the German.  
当他回到座位上不再起身时，这对德国少女来说已是忍无可忍。

Pushing herself up, she marched to the back of the room where he was sitting, earbuds back in, slowly eating food and just looking out the window.  
她站起身来，大步流星地走向房间后方他的座位，只见他重新戴上了耳塞，慢条斯理地吃着食物，只是望着窗外。

Slamming her hands down on his desk, be barely made any indication she was actually there.  
她双手猛地拍在他的桌子上，几乎没引起任何注意她就在那儿。

"What?! Everyone else gets food while I have to starve!?" she exploded, she was sure that the whole class would be looking at her, but she didn't care, not when the boy was obviously trying to get back at her for leaving him last night.  
“什么？！别人都有吃的，我却得饿肚子？！”她爆发了，确信全班都会盯着她，但她不在乎，尤其是当那个男孩显然是为了昨晚她离开他而报复她时。

How petty. 真是小气。

Was that her or him she was referring to?  
她指的是她自己还是他？

Shinji just looked up at her, those eyes almost seemed to be unfocused, far away.  
真嗣只是抬头看着她，那双眼睛似乎有些失焦，仿佛在遥远的某处。

He said nothing as he leaned down to his bag and pulled out one last bundle.  
他一言不发地弯腰从包里拿出了最后一捆东西。

"You forgot to your lunch on the counter." He said in a monotone voice that almost rivaled Rei.  
"你忘了把午餐放在柜台上了。" 他用一种几乎能与丽相媲美的单调声音说道。

Her eyes narrowed; she'd never seen the boy like this before. Where was that life and energy he had that she had come to know? Where was that kid that confidently brought her lunch for the very first time?  
她的眼睛眯了起来；她从未见过这个男孩如此模样。那个她所熟悉、充满生机与活力的他去哪儿了？那个第一次自信地给她带午餐的孩子去哪儿了？

Where was the boy that called her the Roter Drache?  
那个叫她红龙的孩子去哪儿了？

Swiping the bundle from his desk she glared at him "I didn't forget it!".  
她从他桌上抓起那捆东西，瞪着他，“我没忘记！”

"I know you didn't." he said, turning and looking back out the window.  
“我知道你没忘。”他说着，转身又望向窗外。

ʡʘʘʢ

"Leaving the cooking up to Shinji?" Misato rolled her eyes at the man setting a coffee down next to her "that's good, I'm glad you're not just eating instant ramen."  
“把做饭的任务交给真嗣？”美里对那个给她端来咖啡的男人翻了个白眼，“那挺好，我很高兴你不再只是吃速食拉面。”

Misato pouted "Yeah unlike you, some people have work to do and not waste time on cooking."  
美里噘嘴道：“是啊，不像你，有些人还有工作要做，而不是浪费时间在做饭上。”

Flipping open her laptop she just heard him pipe up again.  
她打开笔记本电脑，就听到他又开口了。

"Serious as ever about your work, that's good, it's a strength most of the time at least,"  
“一如既往地认真对待工作，这很好，大多数时候至少是个优点，”

"Why are you here Kaji?" she snapped at the man, who took a seat next to her without even blinking.  
“你为什么在这里，加持？”她对那个男人厉声说道，他坐在她旁边，连眼睛都没眨一下。

"Shinji made some interesting points." He smiled, she rolled her eyes, if that kid was trying to play matchmaker when he couldn't even stand to…  
“真嗣说了些有趣的观点。”他微笑着，她翻了个白眼，如果那孩子试图当媒人，而他甚至都无法忍受……

"and…" “而且……”

"Of course," she muttered.  
“当然，”她咕哝道。

He cleared his throat, "well first let me ask if you wanted to get something to eat, I know a great place southside that'll blow the kid's cooking out of the water."  
他清了清嗓子，“首先让我问你是否想吃点东西，我知道南边有一家很棒的地方，绝对能让那孩子的厨艺相形见绌。”

"I'll think about it." she grumbled, not wanting to give the man any hope.  
“我会考虑的。”她咕哝着，不想给那人任何希望。

.

.

.

"What else?" she asked him.  
"还有什么？" 她问他。

He frowned "I don't want you to think less of me for this." He started.  
他皱眉，"我不想你因此看轻我。" 他开始说道。

She half-heartedly laughed, like that'd be hard.  
她半心半意地笑了笑，好像那会很难似的。

"Shinji…" Oh god, what now "he, well I don't even know if it was confiding, maybe I just hit a nerve."  
"真嗣…" 哦天哪，又怎么了 "他，呃，我甚至不确定他是不是在倾诉，也许我只是触动了他的某根神经。""

"What is it?" now he had her full attention, Shinji and what he was describing didn't usually go together,  
"什么事？" 现在他完全吸引了她的注意力，真嗣和他描述的事情通常不搭边，

"Don't… if anything comes from this… don't let him suspect me, I feel bad enough since it was two men having a straight talk."  
"别… 如果这事有什么后续… 别让他怀疑我，我因为这是两个男人之间的直率对话已经感到够内疚了。""

She snorted louder this time "Shinji can hardly be called a man and you know that."  
她这次哼得更响了，“真嗣根本算不上男人，你心里清楚。”

He looked at her seriously, not taking the joke at all.  
他严肃地看着她，完全没有把这当作玩笑。

"God, he must've said something to change your attitude this much."  
“天哪，他肯定说了什么，才让你态度转变这么大。”

He nodded. 他点点头。

"I think…" he stopped reassuring himself.  
“我想……”他停了下来，不再自我安慰。

"I think he's got a broken heart." He said frowning.  
“我想他是心碎了。”他皱着眉说。

Misato half shrugged "Well he can join the club with plenty of other people, it's a little weird sure, you'd think a kid his age couldn't bounce back from one crush but…"  
美里半耸了耸肩，“好吧，他可以加入那个俱乐部，和其他很多人一样，虽然有点奇怪，但你会以为他这个年纪的孩子无法从一次单恋中恢复过来，但是……”

"Katsuragi," he looked at her "he wasn't a kid talking about an unrequited crush, what he told me, confessed to me, it…"  
“葛城，”他看着她，“他不是在谈论一段无果的暗恋，他告诉我的，向我坦白的，那……”

"What?" “什么？”

"I was jealous." “我嫉妒了。”

"He described it, it sounded so... pure, so… I pushed him why he didn't call her, 'a dashing EVA pilot' I called him." he chuckled.  
"他描述得那么...纯粹，那么...我逼问他为什么不称她为‘英勇的 EVA 驾驶员’，我笑出声来。"

"He said he couldn't, no matter what he said it wasn't possible until he practically told me he _failed_ her."  
"他说他做不到，无论他说什么，都不可能，直到他几乎告诉我他辜负了她。"

.

.

.

"I think whoever he loved killed herself, and he feels responsible for it."  
"我想他爱的人自杀了，而他觉得自己有责任。"

Miasto's heart dropped, an empty mass filled her.  
米亚托的心沉了下去，空洞的感觉填满了她。

She looked away from the man.  
她避开了那个男人的目光。

It would explain a lot actually…  
这其实能解释很多事情……

Her head spun, no child should have to feel that way, no one in general should feel that way.  
她的头一阵眩晕，没有孩子应该承受这种感觉，任何人都不应该经历这种感觉。

"There was nothing in his reports before he came here?" he asked, genuinely concerned.  
"在他来这里之前，他的报告里没有任何异常吗？" 他问道，语气中流露出真切的担忧。

"There was nothing in his reports about him knowing German either…"  
"他的报告里也没有提到他会德语……"

"or multiple instruments..."  
"或多种乐器..."

He raised an eyebrow, "He keeps brining home different ones from school…" she said with a sad smile. "Keeps telling me that he wants to learn another instrument, I don't think he's asking to borrow them though."  
他挑了挑眉，"他总是从学校带回不同的乐器…" 她带着一丝苦笑说，"一直告诉我他想学另一种乐器，但我觉得他不是在请求借用它们。"

"A bit of teenage rebellion?"  
"青春期的叛逆？"

"Ha, if you could call it that, it's better than stealing from convenience stores, he takes them back at least."  
哈，如果这也能称之为“拿”的话，总比从便利店偷窃强，他至少还会还回去。

.

.

.

"One more thing…" "还有一件事……"

"Hmm?" "嗯？"

"Are you alright?" "你还好吗？"

That question, she hadn't been expecting at all, and it took a bit of effort to keep her mouth from falling open.  
那个问题，她完全没有预料到，费了好大劲才没让嘴巴张得老大。

"Huh?" “啊？”

"I heard the rumors about what happened with the Sixth…"  
“我听说了关于第六组发生的事情的传闻……”

"No!" She cut him off, slamming her hands down on the table with fire was in her eyes, and a pain he could see.  
"不！" 她打断他，双手猛地拍在桌上，眼中燃烧着怒火，还有他看得出的痛苦。

He'd seen it only one other time, when she was walking out his front door.  
他只见过一次，那是在她走出他家门的时候。

"Read the report yourself." She hissed "that's all that happened."  
"你自己看报告吧。" 她低声怒道，"事情就是这样。"

Kaji frowned, so it was true…  
加治皱起眉头，看来是真的……

**I am not a fan of the middle of 2.0, at least trying to adapt it into writing, works good for a movie, but damn cinematic time is a bitch.  
我不太喜欢 2.0 的中间部分，至少尝试将其改编成文字时，电影效果不错，但该死的电影时间真是让人头疼。**

**Shoutouts 致谢**

**Akomis – Hey I didn't set the ground rules, Anno did. The one ray of hope you guys got is the fact it's Rebuild 2.0, so we might just have a window of time here…  
Akomis – 嘿，我没设定这些规则，是庵野秀明设的。你们唯一的希望是这是《新世纪福音战士剧场版：序》，所以我们可能还有一点时间窗口……**

**UltraSpink of Da USA- I basically spent a few days just writing bits and pieces of lives Shinji might've experienced when I started writing the story, some are interesting concepts that I'm not sure would make very good individual stories. I'm sure there will be plenty that aren't going to make it in.  
美利坚超旋风- 基本上，我花了几天时间只是写了一些关于真嗣可能经历的生活片段，当我开始写这个故事时，有些是很有趣的概念，我不确定它们是否能成为很好的独立故事。我确信会有很多内容不会被纳入其中。**

**EvaPilotFair- Even? No way, Shinji only got impaled by six spears, to Asuka's nine. She'd totally hold that over him. All jokes aside thanks, the middle of 2.0 is just kinda annoying to work through.  
Eva 飞行员公平- 甚至？不可能，真嗣只被六根矛刺穿，而明日香被九根。她肯定会拿这个来压他一头。说笑归说笑，谢谢，2.0 中间的部分确实有点烦人。**

**A Guy- You gotta be more hopeful! Fanservice that is neither earned nor set up is a disservice, I've scrapped nearly a dozen meta jokes just because I thought they were too jarring, I'm not going to just randomly promise things that don't belong.  
一个家伙- 你得更加乐观！未经铺垫和赢得的粉丝服务是一种失礼，我几乎因为觉得它们太突兀而放弃了近一打的元笑话，我不会随意承诺那些不属于这里的东西。**

**calborghete- It is sad, but I honestly think that's what she would done if Shinji had been braver. She's not Soryu, who would have loved that, it's why** _**Advice and Trust**_ **works so well, because you can believe that if Shinji had reached out and held her in that kiss, it would have blown that relationship wide open. It's their tragedy, that all it would have taken was a few words for them to understand how similar they are. Our Shinji and Shimikazi… well (without spoiling anything) it's not that simple.**  
calborghete- 这很悲伤，但我真心认为，如果真嗣再勇敢一些，她或许就会那么做。她不是惣流，不会喜欢那种情况，这也是“建议与信任”如此奏效的原因，因为你可以相信，如果真嗣在那次亲吻中伸出手拥抱她，那段关系就会彻底改变。他们的悲剧在于，只需几句言语，他们就能明白彼此有多么相似。我们的真嗣和渚薰……唉（不剧透），事情远非那么简单。

**luis3007- Thanks a lot! luis3007- 非常感谢！**

**Alright, you guys will probably get a double header this weekend, just because the next chapter is probably gonna be short and the one after that should be extra-long.  
好吧，你们这周末可能会迎来双料节目，因为接下来的《一千零一夜》可能篇幅较短，而再下一篇应该会特别长。**

**Until Next Time. 下次再会。**


### Chapter 17: "...There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure…"  
Chapter 17: "...墙上有个标志，但她想确认一下…"

Rei Ayanami laid in her room for what had felt like eternity.  
绫波零躺在她的房间里，感觉仿佛已经过了永恒。

It wasn't that this was unusual, she was accustomed to sleepless nights.  
这并非罕见之事，她早已习惯无眠之夜。

This time it wasn't the usual thoughts that plagued her.  
这次困扰她的，并非往常那些思绪。

_Thank you 谢谢你_

_Words of gratitude 感激之词_

_I've never said them to him…  
我从未对他说过……_

Her eyes moved over to Commander Ikari's glasses, her one possession that she coveted.  
她的目光移向了碇司令的眼镜，那是她珍视的唯一物品。

She had said those words to the two of them, the father and the son. Why?  
她曾对这对父子说过那些话。为何？

The First Child felt the same with both of them… no, that wasn't true.  
初号机对他们的感觉是一样的……不，并非如此。

There was a warmth about the Third Child that wasn't quite the same with his father.  
三号机身上有一种不同于他父亲的温暖。

She had only felt this way since the battle with the Sixth Angel.  
自从与第六使徒的战斗后，她才有了这种感觉。

What had changed? 是什么改变了呢？

The Third Child had. That she was sure of, he was not as timid.  
第三适格者变了。这一点她很确定，他不再那么胆怯。

"_Why were you so concerned?"_  
“你为何如此担心？”

_He had just responded with a smirk while resting against the side of the entry plug.  
他只是靠在插入栓的一侧，带着一丝得意的笑容回应。_

She had asked him that after he had hurt himself just as his father had, opening her entry plug.  
就在他像他父亲那样受伤后，她打开了自己的插入栓，问了他这个问题。

Why? 为什么？

His presumed death had changed something about him.  
他假定的死亡改变了他的一些东西。

He had only recently been listening to his music player again, she couldn't remember a time after the Sixth Angel when he had done that.  
他最近才又开始听音乐播放器，她不记得在第六使徒事件后他有这样做过。

But before that new... old behavior…  
但在那新的...旧的行为之前…

Brighter… 更明亮…

Perhaps… yes brighter, more alive certainly.  
或许…是的，更明亮，确实更有生气。

There was no way for her to be sure, but the Third Child had shown more confidence, especially in regards to the Second Child.  
她无法确定，但第三适格者展现出了更多的自信，尤其是在面对第二适格者时。

Unit-02's pilot had been aggressive, temperamental, while also being a loner. Much like the Third Child had seemed to be, simply taking the opposite solution to reach the same outcome.  
二号机的驾驶员曾是个好斗、情绪化且孤僻的人。与第三适格者似乎相似，只是采取了相反的方式达到相同的结果。

But the Pilot of Unit-01 had not been daunted by her. Rei was sure that he would have never dealt with a person like her before the Sixth Angel, however now?  
但初号机的驾驶员并未被她吓倒。绫波确信，在第六使徒之前，他从未遇到过像她这样的人，然而现在呢？

He seemed to know exactly how to go about dealing with her temperament, while not shrinking away from her verbal assaults.  
他似乎完全知道如何应对她的脾气，同时又不回避她的言语攻击。

Sometimes physical assaults too.  
有时候还有身体上的攻击。

He had brought her food, just as he had brought herself food.  
他给她带来了食物，就像他给自己带来食物一样。

That warmth in her chest again.  
她胸中再次涌起那股暖意。

What did it all mean?  
这一切意味着什么？

ʡʘʘʢ

Asuka picked at her food.  
明日香挑拣着食物。

"Eh, it's not as good today." She grumbled to herself as she chewed a piece of meat.  
“唉，今天没那么好吃了。”她一边嚼着一块肉，一边咕哝着自言自语。

Looking back towards the Third Child, he just sat there with headphones in.  
回头看向第三适格者，他只是坐在那里，戴着耳机。

For the last few days, it was like he never stopped, the only time she didn't see him with it was during dinner.  
最近几天，他似乎从未停下，唯一一次没看到他戴耳机的时候是在晚餐时。

She also knew he left them behind when he snuck out with those instruments, he'd been bringing home. The German wasn't stupid, Misato might be blackout drunk, but she could still hear him when he snuck out.  
她也知道，当他带着那些带回家的乐器偷偷溜出去时，他留下了他们。那个德国人并不傻，美里可能已经醉得不省人事，但她仍然能听到他偷偷溜出去的声音。

It only took a second to peek into his room and see that whatever he brought home was gone and his SDAT player had been left behind.  
只需一秒钟就能瞥一眼他的房间，发现他带回家的东西已经不见了，而他的 SDAT 播放器却被留了下来。

Where he went? That was still a mystery to her, it wasn't like he could go far.  
他去了哪里？对她来说仍然是个谜，他不可能走得太远。

"Asuka?" “明日香？”

She was brought out of her thoughts by… Hikari? Yeah, that was her name. The girl that had gone with them on Kaji's 'fieldtrip'.  
她被…光？没错，是她的名字。那个曾和他们一起参加过狩谷的“实地考察”的女孩打断了思绪。

Of course she hadn't got to know the girl much due to the fact she practically clung to Togi the entire time.  
当然，由于她几乎全程都紧贴着东木，所以她并没有太多机会了解这个女孩。

"Can I eat with you?" she asked, a small smile on her face.  
“我可以和你一起吃吗？”她问道，脸上带着一丝微笑。

Asuka narrowed her eyes, "You can, but I'm not sharing my lunch with you…"  
明日香眯起眼睛，“你可以，但我不会和你分享我的午餐……”

The pig-tailed girl just smiled warmly and held up her own lunch. Asuka grumbled to herself in annoyance, ever since she was little she didn't want to eat with others, even when she no longer had to make sure other children didn't swipe her food.  
那个扎着马尾的女孩只是温暖地笑了笑，举起自己的午餐。明日香自言自语地抱怨着，自从她小时候起就不想和别人一起吃饭，即使她不再需要确保其他孩子不会偷走她的食物。

"I noticed you don't usually eat with others."  
“我注意到你通常不和其他人一起吃饭。”

Asuka just grumbled something as she took another bite of food.  
明日香只是咕哝了一句，又咬了一口食物。

"You seemed pretty fine with it when we went on that trip with Mr. Kaji."  
“我们和加持先生一起去旅行时，你看起来挺乐意的。”

"That was different." “那不一样。”

"How so?" "怎么会这样？"

"I didn't have a choice."  
"我别无选择。"

"Hmm." "嗯。"

For a few more bites they ate in peace, the Second Child was perfectly fine with that, despite the girl's overly happy face.  
他们又安静地吃了几口，二号对此完全没意见，尽管女孩的笑脸过于灿烂。

"Do you have a partner to the spring dance?"  
“你有舞伴参加春季舞会吗？”

The redhead rolled her eyes, at the question or the idea that 'Spring' was being used for its' name. It there were no season anymore, so why bother.  
红发女孩翻了个白眼，无论是对这个问题的本身，还是对用“春季”来命名这个概念。既然已经没有季节之分了，何必多此一举。

The girl certainly knew about her situation, despite her being able to dissuade everyone in the class (save one) from talking to her, she had still found plenty of letters stuffed into her desk and locker once the official date had been announced.  
尽管女孩成功劝阻了班上所有人（除了一人之外）与她交谈，但在正式日期公布后，她的课桌和储物柜里依然塞满了许多信件。

Her annoyance only grew at the idea that the girl in front of her was one of the people responsible for organizing the event.  
她对眼前女孩竟是活动组织者之一的想法愈发感到恼火。

"No." she said bluntly. "不。"她直截了当地说。

"Oh, c'mon, a Winter Wonderland theme, all night music and dancing, you can't just go by yourself." Hikari practically cried.  
"哦，拜托，冬日仙境主题，整晚的音乐和舞蹈，你不能一个人去。" 光几乎要哭了。

"Who said I was even going." The redhead growled back.  
"谁说我一定要去。" 红发女孩咆哮着回应。

The class rep just slunk back into her seat, somehow realizing that she might have bit off more than she could chew.  
班代表刚刚悄悄地回到座位上，不知怎么地意识到自己可能咬下了超过咀嚼能力的东西。

ʡʘʘʢ

"Commander Ikari." “碇司令。”

The two of them said across from each other, at opposite ends of a rather long table.  
两人相对而坐，位于一张相当长的桌子的两端。

"Yes," he said looking up from his steak.  
"是的，" 他抬起头，从牛排上移开视线说道。

"Are meals enjoyable?" the girl asked taking a break from eating the pills provided to her.  
"吃饭很愉快吗？" 女孩暂停了吞咽给她提供的药片，问道。

"Yes." "是的。"

"Do you enjoy eating with others?" This feeling inside her stomach…  
"你喜欢和别人一起吃饭吗？" 她胃里的这种感觉……

"Yes." "是的。"

"Does it make you happy to have food cooked for you?" Was this nervousness?  
"有人为你做饭会让你感到开心吗？" 这是紧张吗？

"Yes." "是的。"

"Commander Ikari." "碇司令。"

"Next time, would you like to have a meal with your son and the others?" That was her question…  
"下次，您愿意和您的儿子以及其他成员一起用餐吗？" 这是她的提问……

.

.

.

"No, I don't have the ti…." The man started, but stopped, the words evaporating into thin air.  
“不，我没有那个……”男人开口道，却又戛然而止，话语如烟般消散在空气中。

That look, the look the bluenette in front of him was giving him.  
那个眼神，眼前这位蓝发少年正投向他的眼神。

Superimposing over the girls face, a woman's took its place.  
在女孩的脸庞上，一个女人的面容逐渐浮现。

_Her_ face… 她的脸……

"_Darling, please take care of Shinji."_  
"亲爱的，请照顾好真嗣。"

_She graced him with a soft smile.  
她温柔地对他微笑。_

Yui… 唯…

It was her, asking him again, making him promise her that.  
是她，再次向他提出请求，让他向她承诺那件事。

A memory from a lifetime ago.  
来自久远一生的记忆。

How could he refuse her?  
他怎能拒绝她？

"Alright, I will." "好的，我会的。"

ʡʘʘʢ

The deafening noise of the server room was an old friend to the man who now sat there, ethernet cables entangled around him.  
服务器机房震耳欲聋的噪音对现在坐在那里的男人来说，已是老朋友了，以太网线缠绕在他周围。

On his laptop's screen he looked over the progress of his decryption, having access to normal employee files was easy, breaking into even the next tier of security took time.  
他盯着笔记本电脑屏幕上解密的进度，获取普通员工文件很容易，但要突破下一层安全级别则需要时间。

Lots of time. 很多时间。

The cigarette in his hand had burnt down to the filter, but he hadn't bothered to stick it in his ashtray on the ground next to him quite yet.  
他手中的香烟已经烧到了过滤嘴，但他还没来得及把它放进旁边地上的烟灰缸里。

He kept his gaze on the screen.  
他一直盯着屏幕。

This wasn't his mission. 这并非他的任务。

So why was he looking into this?  
那么，他为何要探究此事呢？

A feeling. Did he need anything more?  
只是一种感觉。他还需要更多理由吗？

As a new popup came onto his screen, Kaji's drifting eyes snapped open.  
当一个新的弹窗出现在屏幕上时，凯吉游离的目光猛地聚焦了。

Sifting through files his eyes scanned for what he was looking for.  
翻阅着文件，他的目光扫视着寻找所需的信息。

Ikari, Shinji 碇真嗣

Doubling clicking, all documents related to the boy appeared to him. Birth certificate, fingerprints, medical records…  
双击之后，所有与男孩相关的文件逐一显现。出生证明、指纹记录、医疗档案……

Incident Report… 事故报告……

It was its own file, opening it, Kaji looked over the pictures taken of the pale corpse, the boy had been shortly before being placed in quarantine. It unnerving to see the boy who had been so lively degraded to such a state.  
这是一份独立的文件，打开它，加持审视着那具苍白尸体被拍下的照片，男孩在被隔离前的那一刻。看到曾经如此活泼的男孩沦落至此，令人不安。

Next, video footage of the kid being practically cooked inside the entry plug played, and the man had to admit, if the audio had been on, he wouldn't have wanted to hear those screams. It was like the boy had been tortured.  
接着播放的是男孩在驾驶舱内几乎被活活烤熟的视频，男人不得不承认，如果当时有录音，他绝不想听到那些尖叫声。那感觉就像男孩遭受了酷刑。

No wonder Misato didn't want to talk about it.  
难怪美里不想谈论这件事。

Another folder led to Ritsuko's scientific theories on the Third Child's reanimation, ranging from residual LCL in his lungs to some sort of connection with the Evangelion itself.  
另一个文件夹里是律子关于第三适格者复活的科学理论，从他肺部残留的 LCL 到与 EVA 本身某种联系的推测。

Kaji's mind wasn't suited for this type of advanced science and engineering, but it didn't matter, this wasn't what he was truly after anyway.  
加持对这种高级科学与工程并不擅长，但这无关紧要，毕竟这并非他真正追寻的东西。

He opened what files had been recorded before the boy had come to NERV, it wasn't much, psychological reports from his 'teacher' that he lived with, all of which seemed to describe a completely different boy. Timid, anti-social, completely isolated from his surrounding world.  
他打开了男孩来到 NERV 之前留下的文件，内容不多，都是与他同住的‘老师’所做的心理报告，这些报告描述的似乎是一个完全不同的孩子。胆小、反社会，完全与周围世界隔绝。

Class rankings and grades, despite living with someone who had been an educator, the grades were simply not that outstanding.  
成绩和排名，尽管与一位曾是教育者的人同住，但成绩并不出众。

Subpar would be the best word.  
平庸一词最为贴切。

That _was_ the case until recently.  
直到最近还是那样。

All this could be circumstantial after all, it wasn't like Section 2 had been trailing the boy his whole life, but Kaji had to admit there was just something disturbing about how little information on the boy there was.  
这一切毕竟可能只是巧合，并不是说第 2 课从他出生起就一直跟踪这个男孩，但碇不得不承认，关于这个男孩的信息少得令人不安。

It was as if he were barely a person, a ghost that just hovered through the world, not influencing anything or anyone and having nothing influencing him either.  
他仿佛几乎不是一个真实存在的人，而是一个幽灵，只是飘荡在这个世界上，既不影响任何人或事，也没有任何事物影响他。

There was certainly no mention of friends, let alone anyone that may have been close or died.  
当然，没有任何关于朋友的记录，更不用说任何可能亲近的人或已故之人了。

You'd think that would be in a psychological report?  
你以为这会在心理报告里提到吗？

So far, the boy was a mystery, and Kaji didn't really know if there was an answer.  
到目前为止，这个男孩仍是个谜，加持并不确定是否存在答案。

**Like father like son hmm? And who here thought I forgot about Rei? Trust me, we're gonna have a bit of fun (lips sealed). It's a bit short today, but tomorrow you guys get an extra long chapter so that makes up for it, probably another two on Wednesday because I won't be able to upload this weekend and you all need a bit of cheering up judging by the reviews, damn SDAT player…  
有其父必有其子，嗯？谁会以为我忘了丽呢？相信我，我们会有点乐趣（保密）。今天有点短，但明天你们会得到一篇特别长的chapter，算是补偿了，可能周三还会再有两篇，因为我这周末无法上传，而根据评论来看，你们都需要一些振奋，该死的 SDAT 播放器……**

**SHOUTOUTS! 特别鸣谢！**

**EvaPilotFair – Be nervous or don't be, there's nothing wrong with holding onto hope, it might even be rewarded. I don't hate the middle part of 2.0, Its just annoying to adapt it to writing and add in your on scenes.  
EvaPilotFair – 紧张也好，不紧张也罢，怀抱希望并无不妥，甚至可能得到回报。我不讨厌 2.0 的中间部分，只是改编成文字并加入自己的场景有些烦人。**

**Akomis- Thanks! Akomis- 谢谢！**

**A Guy- You know I took it seriously until after the chapter was out and I was re-watching 2.0 and remembered the end credits scene and, well *facepalm* "oh", so sorry about that. Yeah, that bit of knowledge isn't the only one that's gonna be backfiring.  
A Guy- 你知道，我原本是很认真的，直到chapter出来后，我重看 2.0 时想起了片尾的场景，然后，呃 *捂脸* "哦"，对此我深感抱歉。没错，那点知识不是唯一会反咬一口的。**

**KendrixTermina- (Non spoiler explanation from what we know as of Chapter 17) Yes, this is NGE Shinji, it's been a** _**long**_ **time since the events of EOE and every life seems to be just one more degree away from normal. This is the first time he's been plopped down into the Rebuild world, though it's not as much a coincidence as it seems, oops I said too much.**  
KendrixTermina-（截至Chapter 17 章的非剧透解释）没错，这是《新世纪福音战士》中的真嗣，距离《EOE》事件已过去许久，每个人的生活似乎都与正常状态渐行渐远。这是他首次被置于《Rebuild》系列的世界中，尽管这并非表面上那么巧合，哎呀，我说得太多了。

**Ultraspink of Da USA- It's not bad you need to see your characters 'at rest', it works perfectly well for a movie, but clear cinematic time isn't Evangelions strong suit and there's a bunch of little scenes tied together so you have to choose which is important, which would change, and where to include what you wanted to add.  
美国超粉- 你需要看到你的角色们“休息”，这并不坏，对于电影来说效果很好，但明确的电影时间并非《新世纪福音战士》的强项，而且有许多小场景串联在一起，所以你必须选择哪些是重要的，哪些会改变，以及在哪里加入你想添加的内容。**

**Calborhete- Thanks! The patience has been rewarded!  
Calborhete- 谢谢！耐心终于得到了回报！**

**Dyinglittelstar – Zeruel? We don't have cool angel names in Rebuild lol. All jokes aside there still one more Angel we have to deal with before we get there…  
Dyinglittelstar – Zeruel？在《新世纪福音战士新剧场版》里我们可没有这么酷的天使名字，哈哈。说正经的，在那之前我们还得对付另一个使徒……**

**Until Next Time. 下次再会。**

### Chapter 18: "…It started out as a bit of fun…"  
Chapter 18: "…起初只是开个玩笑…"

Misato sipped coffee, it had been a rough morning, but she was used to a small hangover by now.  
美里啜饮着咖啡，今早颇为不顺，但她已习惯了些许宿醉。

And as always Rits' coffee maker worked its magic once again.  
一如既往，Rits 的咖啡机再次施展了它的魔法。

"A training simulation?" “训练模拟？”

"Yeah, like what you had me do, but together as a team."  
“对，就像你之前让我做的那样，但这次是作为团队一起。”

Ritsuko frowned, "I looked into it, we have 3 chambers, but the MAGI can't have all three of you in there with an enemy as complex as an Angel, it'd be glorified target practice."  
律子皱眉道：“我查过了，我们有三个舱室，但 MAGI 系统无法同时容纳你们三人和像使徒这样复杂的敌人，那只会变成一场华丽的靶子练习。”

"But can take three pilots at a time?" Shinji asked the scientist, an idea coming to mind.  
“但一次可以容纳三位驾驶员吗？”真嗣向科学家询问，心中浮现一个想法。

"Can you reskin my Evangelion to be an Angel?"  
“你能把我的 EVA 改造成使徒的外观吗？”

"What?" the blonde asked completely confused.  
"什么？" 金发女子完全困惑地问道。

"I have the most combat sorties between the three and I know what we can work on as a group."  
"我在我们三人中执行的战斗任务最多，我知道我们作为一个团队可以改进的地方。"

"Who better to be an OPFOR?" he asked her.  
"谁比他更适合担任假想敌呢？" 他问她。

ʡʘʘʢ

"Why do we have to do this again?" Asuka practically whined.  
“为什么我们又得做这个？”明日香几乎是在抱怨。

She shifted in her seat as the video of Rei in her sim seat popped up on her screen.  
她调整了一下坐姿，屏幕上随即出现了丽坐在模拟器座椅上的视频。

She didn't like the simulators as much as Unit-02, even with all the time she had spent in them back in Germany, it didn't have that comforting, normal feeling of the EVA she had come to know over the years.  
她对模拟器并不像对二号机那样有好感，尽管在德国时她在模拟器里度过了很多时间，但那种熟悉的感觉，那种多年来她所习惯的 EVA 的感觉，模拟器始终无法给予。

It had a 'synthetic' feeling to her as much as that made sense. It wasn't like the 'natural' sense of Unit-02.  
对她来说，这种感觉虽然有些‘合成’，但也不无道理。它不像二号机那种‘自然’的感觉。

"We're trying to get you all used to working together and keep your combat skill sharp." Misato said with a smile.  
“我们正努力让你们习惯协同工作，同时保持你们的战斗技能敏锐。”美里微笑着说。

She gritted her teeth "Then where's the Third Child, shouldn't he be here for that?"  
她咬紧牙关，“那第三适格者呢，他不应该也在这里吗？”

"He couldn't make it; he's preoccupied with something else."  
"他来不了了，他有别的事忙着。"

The redhead just grumbled in annoyance.  
红发女孩只是恼火地咕哝了一声。

The screen came to life as the simulated EVA bay sprawled out in front of her.  
屏幕亮了起来，模拟的 EVA 发射舱在她面前展开。

"The simulator shouldn't have any neural feedback to you guys, so don't hesitate about feeling any pain."  
"模拟器不应该给你们任何神经反馈，所以不必担心会感到疼痛。"

"Like I ever do, I can't speak for the commander's pet though." The redhead boasted.  
"我从来不会，不过指挥官的宠物我就不知道了。" 红发女子自夸道。

The bluenette didn't respond to her jab.  
蓝发女子对她的讽刺没有回应。

"You'll have no information for this fight, you'll be going in blind."  
"这场战斗你将一无所知，你要盲目地投入其中。"

"Unit-00 and Unit-02 launch!" Misato called out in a calmer voice than they were used to, as the two of them raced up their respective virtual launch tracks to the surface.  
"零号机和二号机，发射！" 美里用比平时更平静的声音喊道，两人分别沿着各自的虚拟发射轨道疾速上升至地面。

They reached the surface in unison, but…  
他们同时到达了地面，但是……

"Contact." Rei said as soon as she hit the surface.  
"接触。" 丽一触地便说道。

Asuka couldn't understand it, she didn't see anything in this clearly digitized Tokyo-03.  
明日香无法理解，她在这明显数字化的东京-03 中什么也没看到。

"Asuka get over there and help her!"  
"明日香，快过去帮她！"

"Urgh, always saving my fellow pilots." She grumbled to herself.  
"呃，总是救我的飞行员同伴。" 她咕哝着自言自语。

"Rei?" Misato called out, "status?"  
"丽？" 美里呼唤道，"情况如何？"

"Currently falling down the launch shaft."  
"正在从发射井往下掉。"

Asuka widened her eyes, "It's alright, I can take this thing by myself."  
明日香瞪大了眼睛，“没事的，我一个人就能搞定这东西。”

"Asuka do not engage until Rei is back on the surface!"  
“明日香，在丽回到水面之前不要行动！”

Opening the nearby weapon tower, Asuka pulled out a rifle, while scanning the city for threats.  
打开附近的武器塔，明日香取出一把步枪，同时扫视城市寻找威胁。

"I don't see…" "我看不出……"

A rather loud *snap* pulled her attention to her cable…  
一声相当响亮的“啪”吸引了她的注意，她看向自己的电缆……

"What the…" “什么鬼……”

Her EVA was pulled back, off its feet and off balance, before something crashed into it.  
她的 EVA 刚一出现，就被拉倒，失去平衡，紧接着有什么东西猛地撞了上来。

"Argh!" “啊！”

As soon as it was there it was gone, she didn't have a clue what had just happened.  
那东西刚出现就消失了，她完全不知道刚才发生了什么。

Picking herself back up, she checked her time 4:42.  
她重新站起身，看了看时间：4 点 42 分。

"Asuka the nearest plug is going to be north two blocks."  
“明日香，最近的插头在北边两个街区。”

"Did I ask?!" she barked back as something slammed into her back, pushing her into a building, her rifle going flying.  
“我有问你吗？！”她厉声回敬，随即有什么东西猛地撞上她的后背，将她推入一栋建筑，步枪也脱手飞出。

She couldn't see her opponent, but she could feel it pinning her.  
她看不见对手，但能感觉到它正压制着她。

"Damn you." she growled as her progressive knife deployed.  
“该死。”她咆哮着，手中的渐进式刀刃展开。

Using her free arm, she let it fall into her palm and slashed widely behind her looking to get any kind of contact on the Angel.  
她用空着的那只手，让刀刃落入掌心，猛地向后挥砍，试图与那只天使产生任何形式的接触。

Pushed off her, she was shoved further into the building, but she managed to push herself out of the debris as quickly as possible and spun around to see it.  
她被推开，进一步跌入建筑物内，但她设法尽快从废墟中挣扎出来，转身望去。

The Fourth Angel, the one Shinji had been able to kill with no training, no experience and no plugsuit.  
第四使徒，那个真嗣在没有训练、经验和插入栓服的情况下就能击杀的使徒。

This was going to be easier than she thought.  
这比她想象的要容易得多。

It's core was there for her to see, that AT field couldn't be nearly as strong as the Seventh's, and it really didn't have any special abilities.  
它的核心就在那里，她可以看见，那个 AT 力场不可能有第七使徒的那么强，而且它真的没有任何特殊能力。

A walk in the park really.  
简直是小菜一碟。

She spied a weapon building nearby, a power cable laid next to it, if she…  
她注意到附近有一个武器库，旁边还铺着一条电源线，如果她……

Asuka had no time to think about that, it lurched forwards, blades extending from its palms to swipe at her.  
明日香无暇细想，那东西猛地前倾，掌中利刃伸出，向她猛挥过来。

And it seemed to know exactly what she would do.  
它似乎完全知道她会怎么做。

Angling her AT field, she got glancing blows, but it was so agile, it dodged and weaved as lashed out at her to keep her off balance.  
她调整 AT 力场，试图以擦边攻击，但那生物异常敏捷，闪避腾挪，反向她发起攻击，试图让她失去平衡。

Finally backing up to the weapons tower, she sighed in relief that an Axe appeared from its side.  
最终退至武器塔旁，她松了口气，只见一把战斧从塔侧显现。

Taking it, she lashed out, going fully into an offensive against the Angel.  
她握住战斧，猛烈出击，全力转入对使徒的攻势。

Despite making plenty of hits, the Angel's AT field blocked each and every blow.  
尽管多次命中，天使的 AT 力场却挡下了每一次攻击。

"DAMMIT!" she yelled at she brought it down in one single blow.  
“该死！”她怒吼着，挥下斧头，一击定音。

Its AT field shattered as the axe head dug deep into its shoulder.  
随着斧刃深深嵌入其肩部，它的 AT 力场也随之破碎。

A spray of red washed over her screen as she smiled, that should…  
屏幕上溅开一片红色，她微笑着，应该……

Wait. 等等。

It emerged from the red spray, the axe still in its shoulder.  
它从那片血雾中现身，肩上还嵌着那把斧头。

It was too close. 太近了。

_SHINK 咻_

She blinked as two blades went right into her shoulders. Twisting, turning, and slicing them off.  
她眨眼间，两把利刃直插她的双肩，旋转、翻转，将它们切断。

Asuka couldn't do anything as its undamaged hand latched onto Unit-02s face. The repeated blasts crushing the front of the cranium.  
明日香无能为力，那只完好无损的手紧紧抓住了二号机的脸。连续的爆炸不断摧毁着头颅的前部。

And looked at her clock 0:00.  
她看了一眼时钟，显示为 0:00。

She watched as it let her fall back, only to see Rei jump behind it.  
她看着它让她跌落，却见丽紧随其后跃至其背后。

It turned unnaturally fast, dashing away.  
它转得异常迅速，疾驰而去。

She blinked again. 她又眨了眨眼。

Unit-00 held a spear, but the Angel was too close.  
零号机手持长矛，但使徒距离太近。

It wasn't even a fight.  
这甚至算不上一场战斗。

ʡʘʘʢ

Misato's mouth should have been hanging open, but she was trying to keep the coffee from being spit out instead.  
美里本该张大了嘴巴，但她此刻正努力不让咖啡喷出来。

She was watching the simulation feed with Ritsuko next to her.  
她和律子并肩观看着模拟数据流。

"You see what he did Rits."  
"你看到他做了什么吗，Rits。"

"Hmm." she couldn't even muster a word, she just looked at her friend.  
"嗯。" 她连一句话都说不出来，只是看着她的朋友。

"That kid just outmatched an EVA pilot who's had years of combat training, and better part of a year actually piloting."  
"那孩子刚刚胜过了一个拥有多年战斗训练和近一年实际驾驶经验的 EVA 驾驶员。"

Misato nodded. 美里点了点头。

"He separated them." “他分开了他们。”

"He knew exactly what she was going to do."  
“他完全知道她打算做什么。”

"Look," she said, rewinding the recording to where the axe destroyed the Angels shoulder "he knew she would stand and fight, he sacrificed his shoulder to beat her."  
"看，" 她边说边将录像倒回到斧头摧毁使徒肩膀的部分，"他知道她会站出来战斗，他牺牲了自己的肩膀来击败她。"

"A war of attrition isn't exactly what the EVAs are designed for." Ritsuko noted, even if they had won, repairs would have taken weeks.  
"消耗战并不是 EVA 设计的初衷。" 律子指出，即便他们赢了，修复工作也得花上几周时间。"

"I know… and Rei" "我知道……还有绫波"

"He knew where she would come out, just like the Sixth Angel, take one out of the fight long enough, her internal batteries weren't even fully recharged."  
他知道她会从哪里出现，就像第六使徒一样，只需暂时让她退出战斗，她的内部能量甚至还未完全恢复。

"He just cut the power and waited."  
他只是切断了电源，然后等待着。

They stood in silence. 他们静静地站着。

ʡʘʘʢ

Asuka just sat there, in the dark, empty pod, speechless. The Second Child couldn't even berate the First Child's abilities after what she did.  
明日香只是坐在那里，在黑暗、空荡的驾驶舱中，无言以对。二号机驾驶员甚至无法在她的所作所为之后，对初号机驾驶员的能力进行指责。

The simulators in Germany were nowhere near as extreme as this.  
德国的模拟器远没有这里这么极端。

"Alright, we're going to run another simulation."  
"好了，我们要再进行一次模拟。"

"Use that you learned for this next one."  
"将你从中学到的应用到下一次。"

Asuka tried to settle herself, focusing on keeping herself from shaking. She couldn't believe what just happened.  
明日香试图让自己平静下来，专注于控制自己不要颤抖。她无法相信刚刚发生的事情。

She was the best here; she had spent years in training for this…  
她是这里最出色的；她为此训练了多年……

This was just a simulation.  
这只是一个模拟。

Her view changed, back in the staging area, she gripped the controls, now she was angry.  
她的视角变了，回到准备区，她紧握控制器，现在她怒火中烧。

"Launch!" She heard Misato's call.  
“发射！”她听到美里喊道。

Again, they went to the surface, this time appearing next to each other.  
他们再次来到地面，这次是并肩出现。

Instantly Rei tried to get back-to-back with the redhead, who instead dashed for a weapon tower.  
丽立刻试图与红发少女背靠背，但对方却冲向了一座武器塔。

Ironically, that would be the better choice, as Unit-00 what hit by a single purple whip of light.  
讽刺的是，那反而是更好的选择，因为零号机被一道紫色光鞭击中了。

Grabbing a rifle from its rack, Asuka peered out from behind the reinforced tower.  
从架子上抓起一把步枪，明日香从加固的塔楼后向外窥视。

It was the Fourth Angel. That insect-like monstrosity that Shinji quite nearly died defeating.  
那是第四使徒。那个让真嗣差点丧命击败的昆虫般的怪物。

When didn't he nearly die killing an angel?  
他哪次杀天使不是差点丧命？

Idiot. 白痴。

One whip went towards each of them, rolling away, Asuka watched the tower cut in half by the 'arm' of the Angel.  
鞭子分别向他们袭来，滚向一旁，明日香目睹了天使的'手臂'将塔楼一分为二。

She sprayed it down with her rifle, but her aim wasn't steady, instead only half of the hail of gunfire slammed into the AT Field of the target, though it still created a black cloud obscuring it.  
她用步枪向其扫射，但准头不稳，只有一半的弹雨击中了目标的 AT 力场，尽管如此，还是形成了一团黑雾遮蔽了它。

"Dammit!" She said throwing away the useless rifle.  
"该死！" 她甩掉那把无用的步枪，愤愤地说道。

"Asuka, link back up with Rei."  
"明日香，与绫波重新建立联系。"

"I can't get a visual on target!" she growled as she pulled out her EVA's knives, readying for an ambush.  
"我无法锁定目标！" 她咆哮着，从 EVA 中抽出刀刃，准备应对伏击。

One that would never come.  
一个永远不会到来的时刻。

"Unit-02, I need assistance." Rei's voice came through her comms.  
“二号机，我需要支援。”绫波的声音通过通讯传来。

She turned, dashing towards where Rei had been previously, she could see one of her arms wrapped in the purple stream.  
她转身，朝着绫波之前所在的地方疾奔而去，可以看到她的一只手臂被紫色光流缠绕着。

Lunging forwards, her knife sliced through it with ease, releasing the bluenette.  
她猛地前冲，刀刃轻松划过，释放了那位蓝发少年。

"Stop being useless and start killing it!" she yelled at the other EVA pilot as she leapt forwards.  
“别再无用了，开始杀它！”她对着另一名 EVA 驾驶员大喊，随即向前跃去。

The creature dove down, before raising up and flipping her over.  
怪物俯冲而下，随即抬起身躯，将她翻了个身。

Twirling it slashed at both of them in a purple whirlwind.  
紫色旋风中，它旋转着向两人猛劈而去。

Asuka's heart was pounding in her chest. Her EVA's armor was being shredded, and her cable had been cut leaving her on battery power.  
明日香的心脏在胸腔中狂跳。她的 EVA 装甲正被撕裂，电缆已被切断，仅剩电池供电。

The creature… just stopped, before turning to Unit-00.  
那生物……突然停下，随即转向零号机。

Asuka struggled up, but she was able to see the angel moving towards rei.  
明日香挣扎着起身，但她能看到使徒正朝绫波移动。

She didn't even think, even when it had its arms around Unit-00 she launched herself onto its back.  
她甚至没有思考，即便使徒的双臂已经环绕住零号机，她还是猛地扑向了它的背部。

It shook, bucked, and did everything in-between to shake her off, but her knifes did well to keep her in place.  
它摇晃、颠簸，用尽一切手段想把她甩下去，但她的刀刃很好地让她稳住了位置。

She forced her arms to the underside of it, she forced herself forwards.  
她强迫自己的手臂伸到它的下方，强迫自己向前移动。

There, the core. 在那里，核心。

Rei kept its arms busy while she tore into it, stabbing it over and over again, until a sea of red washed over them both.  
丽一边忙于挥舞双臂，一边狠狠地撕咬着它，一次次地刺入，直到一片血红将她们两人淹没。

Time froze and the simulation disintegrated.  
时间凝固，模拟场景随之瓦解。

ʡʘʘʢ

Misato just stared at the screen.  
美里只是盯着屏幕。

"He almost had them." "他差点就得手了。"

"I'm not sure it was the best teamwork I've seen, or if it even _was_ teamwork."  
"我不确定这是否是我见过的最佳团队合作，甚至不确定那是否算得上是团队合作。"

Ritsuko tapped some buttons at her terminal.  
律子在她的终端上轻敲了几下按钮。

"God job you guys, just sit tight we're adjusting for the next sim."  
"干得好，你们俩，就坐稳了，我们正在调整下一次模拟。"

Misato just looked at the two pilots, she was willing to bet they would be sweating by now.  
美里只是看着这两名驾驶员，她敢打赌他们现在肯定在冒汗。

"He held back." she mumbled to no one in particular.  
"他忍住了。"她喃喃自语，并非对任何人说。

The blonde just raised an eyebrow "What do you mean?"  
金发女子只是挑了挑眉，“你什么意思？”

Misato pointed to the footage, "He clearly should have gone after Asuka, she has more training, she had weapons, but he turns and attacks Rei instead.  
Misato 指着录像说：“他显然应该去追 Asuka，她受过更多训练，还带着武器，但他却转身攻击了 Rei。”

Sure, she's closer, but Asuka already has her knives out, she's the clear threat… and he turns away."  
当然，她更近一些，但明日香已经拔出了刀，显然是更大的威胁……而他却转身离开了。

Ritsuko furrowed her brow.  
律子皱起了眉头。

"Do you think he let them win?" she asked, genuinely curious.  
“你觉得他是故意让他们赢的吗？”她问道，真的很好奇。

Misato looked at her then the footage.  
美里看了看她，然后又看向录像。

She nodded. 她点点头。

"Hmmm" “嗯……”

Both just stood there for a moment, letting their thoughts keep them for a moment.  
两人只是站在那里片刻，任由思绪将他们暂时困住。

"Captain Katsuragi." came the commanders voice startling them both.  
“葛城队长。”指挥官的声音突然响起，吓了他们一跳。

"Yes commander?" “是，指挥官？”

"Have Rei sent to lower dogma, there are things that must be attended to."  
"将丽送到下层教义区，有些事情必须处理。"

"That's an order." "这是命令。"

The both looked at each other.  
两人互相对视了一眼。

"Shinji, we're going to have to stop early, Rei's being called away."  
"真嗣，我们得提前结束了，丽被叫走了。"

"Are you sure?" he asked, the boy almost sounded disappointed.  
"你确定吗？" 他问道，男孩的声音几乎带着失望。

"Do you want to go one on one with Asuka?" she asked a slight smile on her face.  
“你想和明日香一对一较量吗？”她脸上带着一丝微笑问道。

Silence 沉默

"Put me in an Evangelion." he said.  
"把我放进《新世纪福音战士》里。" 他说。

They looked at each other.  
他们彼此对视。

"Why, you're never going to face another EVA, it's a waste of time."  
"哎，你再也不会面对 EVA 了，这简直是浪费时间。"

The boy said nothing until he smiled slightly.  
男孩一言不发，直到他微微一笑。

"EVAs can beat Angels, it should be more of a challenge."  
"EVA 能击败使徒，应该更有挑战性才对。"

The looked at each other, "One on one, Unit-01 vs Unit-02?" she asked.  
他们互相对视，“一对一，初号机对二号机？”她问道。

"Stack the deck." he said. "Only a progressive knife for me, give her what she wants."  
“作弊吧。”他说。“我只用一把渐进刀，给她想要的。”

he cut the communication.  
他切断了通讯。

The looked at each other, this was going to be good.  
他们互相对视，这将是一场精彩的对决。

ʡʘʘʢ

"What?" Asuka practically yelled at the screen.  
“什么？”明日香对着屏幕几乎是大喊。

"We're going to be putting you up against a theoretical Unit-01." Misato said calmly "Rei's been called away so it's one on one.  
"“我们将安排你与理论上的零一单元对战。”美里平静地说，“绫波被叫走了，所以这是一对一的较量。”

"That doesn't make any sense" the redhead pouted "EVA's aren't going to fight each other, plus Unit-01's outdated, Unit-02 will wipe the floor with it."  
"那根本说不通" 红发女孩噘嘴道，"EVA 不会自相残杀的，而且零一号机已经过时了，零二号机会把它打得落花流水。"

"If that's so, show us." Misato challenged.  
"如果真是这样，那就展示给我们看。" 美里挑衅地说。"

Determination and a smirk were her answer.  
她以坚定和一丝冷笑作为回应。

"There'll be a weapons tower to your left, so what do you want?"  
"左边会有一个武器塔，你想要什么？"

"Give me the axe and a minigun." she said with a bright smile.  
"给我斧头和一把迷你炮。" 她带着灿烂的笑容说道。

.

.

.

"Launching." "启动中。"

She braced herself for an instant attack, but nothing came.  
她做好了一瞬间遭到攻击的准备，但什么也没有发生。

Instead, she spotted her target across the virtual city. It wasn't hard, after all Unit-01 was painted purple, it was hard to miss.  
相反，她在虚拟城市中发现了目标。毕竟零一号机被涂成了紫色，很难不被注意到。

She smiled to herself, this was just what she needed to blow off some steam.  
她暗自微笑，这正是她需要的发泄方式。

She grabbed the minigun from its tower and readied the weapon.  
她从塔上抓起迷你炮，准备好了武器。

Unit one just stood there, watching, waiting for her to make the first move.  
单位一就站在那里，观察着，等待她先行动。

"Stupid Shinji." she muttered to herself, despite the knowledge that it was just the computer.  
“愚蠢的 Shinji。”她喃喃自语，尽管她知道那只是电脑。

_Click. 咔嚓。_

The image lit up, the tracer rounds cutting a path of destruction through everything in front of her.  
图像亮起，曳光弹在前方划出一道毁灭之路，横扫一切障碍。

_BRRRRT 突突突突_

She smiled at the harmony of the minigun and held down the trigger until all that was left were the red-hot barrels spinning.  
她对着迷你炮的和谐韵律微笑，按住扳机，直到只剩下通红的枪管在旋转。

She waited for the dust to clear.  
她等待尘埃落定。

Slowly but surely, the outline of Unit 01 emerged from the smoke, it rolled off its massive frame, which by her eyes appeared unfazed.  
慢慢地，确切无疑地，零一号机从烟雾中显现出轮廓，它庞大的身躯上烟尘滚落，在她眼中似乎毫发无损。

She hadn't expected it to do much, just pepper up her opponent a little.  
她本没指望它能有多大作用，只是想稍微骚扰一下对手。

It was his turn. 轮到他了。

Reaching its arm out, Asuka watched as it pulled back, then out again, thrusting forward what she could only guess as an AT field.  
手臂伸展开来，阿斯卡眼看着它收回，又再次伸出，向前推进着她只能猜测是 AT 力场的东西。

"SHIT!" she rolled to her right in order to avoid the invisible force cutting a path through the city, buildings shattered, cars few to the horizon, and she barely escaped its wrath.  
“该死！”她向右翻滚，以躲避那无形的力量在城市中开辟出的道路，建筑崩塌，车辆飞向天际，她险些未能逃脱其怒火。

How was that fair? Even she couldn't manipulate an AT Field like that.  
那怎么公平？就连她也无法那样操控 AT 力场。

"C'mon," she said raising her axe.  
"来吧，"她举起斧头说道。

"Let's go." "我们走吧。"

Charging Unit-01, Asuka dodged as AT fields blasted past her, rolling dodging, anything to get close.  
突击单元 01，明日香在 AT 力场中穿梭闪避，翻滚、躲避，一切只为接近目标。

When she did get close, she expected an AT field to block her weapon, but all she found was Unit-0'1s hand.  
当她真的逼近时，她预料到 AT 力场会阻挡她的武器，但迎面而来的却是 01 单元的巨手。

Sweeping low, she swept for Unit-01's leg just as she had done to Shinji when they had first met but found herself plying footsies with two mecha's feet.  
她低身横扫，试图攻击 01 单元的腿部，就像初次与真嗣交手时那样，却发现自己正与两台机甲的脚纠缠不清。

Asuka had been so concentrated on that small fight she forgot about the free hand.  
明日香全神贯注于那场小战斗，以至于忘记了还有一只空着的手。

Crashing into her Evangelion's face she stumbled back, axe discarded.  
撞上她的 EVA 的脸部，她踉跄后退，战斧被丢弃。

Recovering she pulled her blades from their mounts as the Unit-01 pulled only one knife.  
恢复过来后，她从挂架上抽出自己的刀刃，而零一号机只拔出了一把刀。

She narrowed her eyes as they circled each other, neither making the first move.  
她眯起眼睛，两人绕着对方转圈，谁也没有先出手。

Then, they both struck. 随即，两人同时发动了攻击。

ʡʘʘʢ

Misato stared, she wasn't the only one, everyone in the small control room couldn't tear their eyes from the stream that came from inside the simulation.  
美里凝视着，不只是她，控制室里的每个人都无法将目光从模拟器中传出的画面上移开。

Down in the LCL tank, the fake EVA head seemed to struggle with the speed at which the fight was happening.  
在 LCL 罐中，那个仿制的 EVA 头部似乎在努力跟上战斗的节奏。

It was almost art, truly one of the most beautiful things she had seen, so much so that everyone had forgotten about data being recorded and displayed to them so that they could watch this almost ballet of combatants.  
这几乎是一种艺术，真正是她见过的最美丽的事物之一，以至于所有人都忘记了数据正在被记录和展示给他们，让他们得以观赏这场近乎芭蕾的战斗表演。

The weaved around each other, each not letting the other get the upper hand.  
它们缠绕在一起，谁也不让对方占上风。

The Second Child was fast, and very skilled in one-on-one combat, but Shinji simply seemed faster. If she didn't know any better, she would have thought he was able to see her moves right before they happened.  
第二适格者速度极快，且擅长一对一战斗，但真嗣似乎更快。如果不是她了解得更清楚，她几乎会以为他能预见她的动作。

Asuka was all in on offense, the two knives to Shinji's one was evidence enough of that.  
明日香全力以赴地进攻，两把刀对真嗣一把，这已经足够说明问题了。

But Shinji had quickly been able to steal one of hers by allowing the German to land a stab in his shoulder.  
但真嗣迅速地夺走了她的一把刀，让德国少女的刀刺入了他的肩膀。

Twisting, he was able to get it out of her hand and discarded it from the battlefield.  
他扭动身体，成功从她手中夺过物品，并将其丢弃在战场之外。

Now they circled each other again.  
现在他们再次互相绕圈。

She was sure this would be the last action as each hat cut the others power cord.  
她确信这将是最后的行动，因为每个人都切断了对方的电源线。

Both were already down to only a third of their internal batteries' charge.  
两人内部电池的电量都已降至仅剩三分之一。

Then it was Shinji who took the offensive.  
接着，是真嗣采取了攻势。

If she didn't know better, she would have thought that Asuka was put off balance by this sudden aggressiveness.  
如果她不了解情况，她可能会以为明日香被这突如其来的攻击性打乱了阵脚。

Doing her best to keep up with his assault, she ultimately fell for a nonfatal jab to his lower abdomen.  
她竭尽全力跟上他的攻势，最终却因一记非致命的腹部下侧刺击而败下阵来。

But Shinji seemed to know that this was the end of the fight.  
但真嗣似乎知道这场战斗已经结束了。

He let her get close, and he took the damage, before using her balance to bring her forward to the ground.  
他任由她靠近，承受了攻击，随后利用她的平衡感将她拽向前，摔倒在地。

Turning around, he pinned her, and his knife dropped towards her face.  
他转身将她按住，手中的刀刃朝她的脸庞落下。

In that moment even the computers seemed to go silent.  
那一刻，连电脑似乎都陷入了沉默。

His knife found itself embedded itself in the concrete next to Unit-02's head.  
他的刀深深地插入了零二头旁的混凝土中。

Asuka was speechless on the screen in front of the woman.  
屏幕前的女人面前，明日香无言以对。

Getting up, Unit-01 straightened out before offering Unit-02 its hand to get up.  
零一站起身来，调整好姿态后向零二伸出手，帮助它起身。

"That's not a computer is it?" Asuka asked Misato, the link still active.  
“那不是电脑吧？”明日香问美里，连接依然保持活跃。

Misato smiled "Your OPFOR today was Shinji."  
美里微笑道：“你今天的假想敌是真嗣。”

Asuka didn't say anything, she just laid there.  
明日香没有说话，只是静静地躺在那里。

0:00

**It always annoyed me that they don't do any training. Granted the simulator Shinji has in 1.0 is rudimentary, but still, you'd think even Misato would want to train the children. Especially Shinji who's basically taken off the street and shoved in an EVA.  
他们从不进行任何训练，这总让我感到恼火。诚然，一零版中真嗣使用的模拟器相当简陋，但即便如此，你也会认为哪怕是美里也会希望训练这些孩子们。尤其是真嗣，他几乎是从街上被拉来塞进 EVA 里的。**

**Shoutouts! 致谢！**

**Gleaming Onyx – Yeah, I think the Rebuild Gendo is a bit less of a dick then NGE's Gendo, only by one degree since he agrees to have lunch with this son. This Shinji would probably only believe any genuine attempt at connection just more manipulation though and that's sad.  
Gleaming Onyx – 是的，我觉得《新剧场版》中的源堂比《新世纪福音战士》中的稍微不那么混蛋一点，尽管只是一点点，因为他同意和儿子一起吃午饭。但这个真嗣可能只会认为任何试图建立联系的举动都是更多的操纵，这很可悲。**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – Everyone forgets that there's kinda one more before that one, and in Rebuild I'd say it might just be more important.  
UltraSpink of Da USA – 大家都忘了在那之前还有一个，而在《新剧场版》中，我认为它可能更为重要。**

**EVAPilotFair – Have you ever asked yourself what might happen if the boy had more of an audience than just the one in his head?  
EVAPilotFair – 你是否曾问过自己，如果那个男孩的听众不仅仅是他脑海中的那个，会发生什么？**

**Bwanagator – Thanks! That also my favorite part too.  
Bwanagator – 谢谢！那也是我最喜欢的部分。**

**Calborghete – The question is which Asuka… or both?  
Calgorghete – 问题在于，是哪一个明日香……还是两者皆是？**

**Su Exodus – The name of the story** _**is**_ **Relapse lol.**  
苏离散记 —— 故事名为《复发》哈哈。

**A Guy – Yeah, if you've ever seen the Anima art, Shinji basically looks a lot like Kaji, even took over his gardening habits. Trust me there's a reason for that admin access, have you noticed the MAGI not having a fit about his sync test, or giving a percentage of success for the plan against the Eight Angel?  
一个家伙——没错，如果你看过 Anima 的画，就会发现真嗣基本上长得很像加持，甚至连他的园艺习惯都继承了。相信我，那个管理员权限可不是白给的，你注意到 MAGI 对他的同步测试没有异议，或者对对抗第八使徒的计划给出了成功率吗？**

**I wasn't too much of a fan with this chapter, whether its just me not being very good at combat scenes or something else. You guys are getting spoiled this week since I won't be able to upload next weekend, so you'll get another 2 chapters before Thursday, mostly because I want them to be put out together.  
我对这个chapter不太感冒，不管是单纯因为我战斗场面写得不好还是其他原因。你们这周有福了，因为我下周末不能上传，所以你们会在周四前再得到两章，主要是因为我想把它们一起发布。**

**Until Next Time 下次再见**

### Chapter 19: "…My Lili of the lamplight …"  
Chapter 19: "…我的灯火下的莉莉…"

Kaji just sat there on the rooftop with the Section 2 lookout.  
加持只是坐在屋顶上，与第 2 课的瞭望员一起。

It had become something of a 'must see' within Section 2. Taking a night watch and getting to hear the Third Child play just about every instrument imaginable.  
在第 2 分区，这已成为一种'必看'的景象。值夜班并能听到第三适格者演奏几乎所有能想到的乐器。

People had been describing the tunes coming from the rooftop with such conviction that he himself had to come see. He figured Misato was passed out in an alcoholic haze so she couldn't hear, at least if she was even there, tonight she was working late, he checked.  
人们如此确信地描述着从屋顶传来的曲调，以至于他自己也不得不前来一探究竟。他猜想美里可能醉倒在酒精的迷雾中，听不见这些，至少如果她今晚在的话，她工作到很晚，他确认过。

Budget meetings about repairing Unit-00, you'd think they would have built in costs for repairs but… well, that wasn't his job.  
关于修复零号机的预算会议，你会以为他们会预留维修费用，但……好吧，那不是他的工作。

Tonight, he was cursing his luck due to the fog though. At best he might be able to see a silhouette of the boy, that was if he even came out in this weather.  
今晚，他却在诅咒这雾气。最多他或许能瞥见那男孩的轮廓，前提是这天气他还愿意出门。

Down below them few people walked about, the streetlights giving off a pleasing ray of light onto the shining streets below which shined from the day's rainfall.  
在他们下方，行人寥寥，街灯洒下宜人的光芒，照亮了因白日降雨而闪闪发光的街道。

"He's late." He agent next to him grumbled, while gathering up a handful of food wrappers.  
“他迟到了。”他身旁的特工咕哝着，同时收拾起一把食品包装纸。

"I guess we're out of luck." he mumbled, standing up getting ready to leave.  
"我想我们运气不好。" 他咕哝着，站起来准备离开。

Then from the foggy white sea he heard it.  
然后，从朦胧的白色海洋中，他听到了。

A steady slow stream of notes that seemed to sway from the fog. A trumpet that was being played to perfection.  
一段稳定而缓慢的音符流，似乎从雾中摇曳而出。一把小号被演奏得完美无瑕。

Kaji froze there, just listening to the notes from the great emptiness. Could this really be the kid?  
加持愣在那里，只是聆听着来自那片巨大空无的音符。这真的会是那个孩子吗？

Next to him the Section 2 agent sat back in his seat, his annoyance completely erased.  
他身旁的第二课特工靠回座位，他的恼怒已完全消散。

Down below them, the few people that were going about their business stopped, taking a moment under the streetlights to listen to the beautiful symphony of notes.  
在他们下方，那些忙于自己事务的寥寥数人停下脚步，在街灯下驻足片刻，聆听这美妙的音符交响曲。

Kaji even spotted one couple began to sway underneath one of those streetlights, the lighting being perfect due to the fog. The yellow light visible the whole way as it rained down upon them.  
加治甚至注意到一对情侣在其中一个路灯下开始摇摆，由于雾气的缘故，光线显得格外完美。黄色的灯光在雨中洒落，清晰可见。

A memory of a certain violet haired girl and him doing something similar appeared in his mind's eye and the man couldn't keep a smile from forming on his face.  
一段关于某个紫发女孩和他自己也曾做过类似事情的记忆浮现在他眼前，男子不禁露出了微笑。

If Shinji could do that for someone, he was a very special kid indeed.  
如果真嗣能为某人做到这一点，那他确实是一个非常特别的孩子。

ʡʘʘʢ

Asuka decided that for once she would follow the idiot on one of his little outings.  
明日香决定这次要跟着那个白痴一起去他那小打小闹的出行。

Lying in bed she waited, not even her WonderSwan could keep her attention as she waited for the boy to leave. He should be going soon, even with the rather miserable weather they had today, it should have cleared up by now.  
她躺在床上等待着，就连她的 WonderSwan 也无法吸引她的注意力，她只是等待着那个男孩离开。他应该快走了，尽管今天天气相当糟糕，但现在应该已经放晴了。

Hearing the door shut she launched herself off her bed and out the door behind him. Only catching the slightest glimpse of him as he went up the stairways.  
听到门关上的声音，她从床上跳起来，紧随其后冲出门外。只来得及瞥见他上楼梯的背影。

Following him like a predator would stalk their prey, Asuka watched the boy hike all the way to the roof, it wasn't until he made it that she realized he was carrying something.  
如同捕食者追踪猎物一般，明日香紧随男孩一路来到屋顶，直到他抵达那里，她才意识到他携带着某样东西。

It was hazy, a light fog had swept the area, it wasn't heavy enough for her to avoid being seen, but It did limit visibility at a distance.  
雾气朦胧，轻雾笼罩了这片区域，虽不至于让她无法被察觉，但确实限制了远处的视野。

She watched the boy move to the edge of the roof, climbing onto its' ledge.  
她注视着男孩走向屋顶边缘，攀上了屋檐。

Her breath caught in her throat, the idea that he was about…  
她的呼吸一窒，心中闪过一个念头，他似乎正要……

No, he didn't do what she thought he was about to, instead he just opened the black box he held at his side and pulled out a trumpet.  
不，他没有做出她以为他会做的事，而是打开了手边那个黑色盒子，从中取出一支小号。

She could tell it was the one from the school, the wear on it was indicative of something used to practice by rank amateurs, but the idiot held it with such confidence, he cleaned it, readied it, and treated it as though it were a priceless artifact.  
她一眼就认出那是学校的小号，上面的磨损痕迹表明它曾被初学者频繁练习，但这个傻瓜却拿着它，自信满满地擦拭、准备，仿佛手中捧着的是一件无价之宝。

He readied himself pulling it up to his lips, she watched is chest heave and for a moment nothing happened…  
他准备好将它拉至唇边，她注视着他的胸膛起伏，有那么一刻，什么也没有发生……

Then he played. 接着他开始演奏。

She blinked as the notes were blown into the white haze, the fog that clouded their vision.  
她眨了眨眼，音符被吹散在白茫茫的雾气中，那雾遮挡了他们的视线。

The notes seemed to float over to her lazily yet hitting with such force that her breath caught. She knew the tune, it was old, very old.  
音符似乎懒洋洋地飘向她，却以如此强烈的冲击力击中，让她屏住了呼吸。她熟悉这个曲调，它很古老，非常古老。

And it was German. 而且它是德语的。

She remembered the first time she heard it, some event on base in Germany, the memory was faded, but she recalled the song, slow, lonely, yet lovely, a love song to sway the night away with someone you loved.  
她记得第一次听到这首歌，是在德国基地的某个活动上，记忆已经模糊，但她记得那首歌，缓慢、孤独，却又动人，是一首适合与心爱之人共度夜晚的摇篮曲。

Lili Marleen 莉莉·玛莲

That was the name, it came back to her, like some sirens call in the fog.  
就是这个名，它如雾中警笛般回响在她心头。

She just stared at the boy who played it with that lone beat-up trumpet, he played it so… perfectly.  
她只是凝视着那个用那支破旧的小号演奏的男孩，他演奏得如此……完美。

Thoughts of another land seemed to seep into her mind, images of a countryside where she grew up, where she played in, beneath towering trees and lush gardens.  
另一个国度的思绪似乎渗入了她的脑海，浮现出她成长的那片乡村景象，她在参天大树和郁郁葱葱的花园下嬉戏的情景。

The thoughts of rolling fields, of forests that still survived the Second Impact. She thought of the countless small towns with their red roofs situated in valleys.  
她想起了连绵起伏的田野，想起了在第二次冲击中幸存的森林。她想起了坐落在山谷中的无数小城镇，那些红屋顶的小镇。

She thought of the mountains to the south, and the views she had seen, even if it was only for her training. The smell of food that had tickled her nose.  
她想起了南方的群山，以及她所见过的那些景致，尽管那只是为了她的训练。食物的香气曾轻拂过她的鼻尖。

Before being a pilot, before her first combat training course, before…. No she didn't want to think of that.  
在成为飞行员之前，在她第一次参加战斗训练课程之前，在那之前……不，她不想去想那些。

Suddenly it was over, as fast as it had started. He brought the brass instrument down from his lips and just stood there, looking out into the white void.  
突然间，一切就这样结束了，快得如同它开始时一样。他将那黄铜乐器从唇边放下，只是站在那里，凝视着那片白茫茫的虚空。

ʡʘʘʢ

"Trumpet too?" "小号也来吗？"

"well yeah, of course So…" he turned only to see Shikinami there, not the bandaged specter he had been expecting.  
"嗯，当然啦，所以……" 他转过身，却看到的是式波在那里，并非他预想中缠着绷带的幽灵。

In hindsight, he should have planned for something like this, but all he ended up doing was losing his footing and stumbling backwards in surprise.  
事后想来，他本该预料到这种情况，但最终他只是失去了平衡，惊慌失措地向后踉跄了几步。

Luckily, the girl was fast enough to keep him from stumbling over the edge of the rooftop, grabbing onto his shirt and whipping him back onto the roof.  
幸运的是，女孩动作够快，及时抓住他的衬衫，将他从屋顶边缘拽了回来，避免了跌落的危险。

"What are you stupid?!" She yelled at the boy on the ground, who was doing his best to keep his composure.  
“你是不是傻啊？！”她对着地上的男孩大喊，那男孩正尽力保持镇定。

"_What are you stupid?!"_ “你是不是傻啊？！”

He just blinked at her and at the memory.  
他只是对着她和她记忆中的影像眨了眨眼。

"What the hell do you think you're doing?!" she snapped at him.  
“你到底以为自己在干什么？！”她厉声质问他。

"Hey I wasn't the one who decided to sneak up on someone!" He left out the 'on the ledge of a rooftop' but he'd rather not have a shouting match.  
“嘿，偷偷摸摸靠近别人的可不是我！”他省略了“在屋顶边缘”的部分，但更不想陷入一场争吵。

"I didn't sneak up on you! You should've known I'd follow you out of the apartment one day!"  
"我可没有偷偷摸摸接近你！你应该知道有一天我会跟着你走出公寓的！"

He frowned and just pushed himself up from the ground. Brushing off the scrapes he had acquired.  
他皱了皱眉，从地上爬起来，拍掉身上的擦伤。

"So… trumpet too, how many damn instruments do you know?"  
"那么…还有小号，你到底会多少种该死的乐器？"

He shrugged "I had a lot of time on my hands before all this." Technically it wasn't a lie.  
他耸了耸肩，“在这之前我有很多空闲时间。”严格来说，这并不算撒谎。

"Hmph." “哼。”

They just stood there for a moment, before he went around her back to the ledge for the trumpet's case.  
他们就那样站了一会儿，然后他绕到她背后，去取小号箱。

"Do you know Violin?" she asked, breaking the silence.  
“你知道小提琴吗？”她打破了沉默问道。

Shinji just rubbed the back of his head "What do you mean?"  
真嗣只是挠了挠后脑勺，“你什么意思？”

She just pushed past him and started back down to the apartment "Come back to the apartment, then we'll talk."  
她径直推开他，转身向公寓走去，“回公寓再说，到时候我们再谈。”

He just shook his head and packed up his stuff.  
他只是摇了摇头，开始收拾自己的东西。

"_Oh, a little music session with your doll, how cute." Soryu snarled, balancing on the edge of the roof once again._  
“哦，和你的玩偶来场音乐会，真可爱。”Soryu 咆哮着，再次稳稳地站在屋顶边缘。

The boy said nothing, he didn't need Asuka catching him talking to thin air, it was bad enough he let his guard down and got caught up here.  
男孩一言不发，他可不想让明日香发现自己对着空气自言自语，光是放松警惕被困在这里就已经够糟糕了。

Making his way back down to the apartment, he just walked into the living room to see her there, sitting on the couch, a dusty instrument case in front of her.  
他回到公寓，走进客厅，只见她坐在沙发上，面前放着一个积满灰尘的乐器箱。

And his own cello case was there as well, resting on a chair opposite to hers.  
而他的大提琴箱也放在那里，静静地靠在她对面的椅子上。

What exactly was this? 这究竟是怎么回事？

"I want you to show me how to play that song." She said firmly.  
"我想让你教我弹那首曲子。" 她坚定地说。

"What?" “什么？”

"That song you played when I first got here, what's it name?"  
"我刚来时你弹的那首歌，它叫什么名字？"

_Those long-lost days of trying to be in sync with one another came rushing back.  
那些试图与彼此同步的久远日子，突然间涌上心头。_

_Spending every waking moment together, almost always tethered together by earbuds.  
每时每刻都形影不离，几乎总是通过耳机线连在一起。_

_Asuka laying down next to him and him leaning in almost for…  
明日香躺在他身边，而他几乎要靠过去……_

"What song?" she asked again, seemingly displeased with his spacing out.  
“什么歌？”她又问了一遍，似乎对他的走神感到不满。

"I don't know if it has a name." He said simply "I just heard it enough to know how to play."  
"我不知道它叫什么名字。" 他简单地说，"我只是听得多了，知道怎么演奏。"

"You don't have any sheet music?!" she raged at him.  
"你连乐谱都没有吗？！" 她对他怒吼道。"

He just sat down and brought out his cello, holding back a smile, "Trust me, you'll pick it up."  
他只是坐下来，拿出他的大提琴，忍住笑意，"相信我，你会学会的。"

Readying his bow he jut looked at her "Just listen to it first, don't try to remember the notes, just how it feels." He explained.  
他准备好弓，只是看着她，“先听听看，别急着记谱子，感受它的感觉就好。”他解释道。

The redhead just frowned, but said nothing, waiting for him to start.  
红发女孩只是皱了皱眉，但什么也没说，等着他开始。

And he did. 他开始了。

That same symphony he had played for her when she first arrived, the one he could play better than any other piece of music, the one piece of music he could say made him warm.  
那首他曾在她初来时为她演奏的交响曲，他演奏得比任何其他乐曲都要出色，那唯一一首能让他感到温暖的乐曲。

The boy closed his eyes.  
男孩闭上了眼睛。

Sixty-Two seconds of raw emotion the entire battle playing out in his mind like it was yesterday.  
整整六十二秒的原始情感，整场战斗在他脑海中如昨日重现般上演。

_Unit-01 and Unit-02 launching into the air.  
零一和零二号机升空出击。_

_Splitting the Angel only to somersault backwards through the city together.  
将使徒一分为二后，两机一同翻滚着穿越城市。_

_Misato shouting out commands for the defenses around Tokyo-03 to open fire.  
美里大声下达指令，要求东京-03 周边防御系统开火。_

_And finally, them both simultaneously fighting to force the Angel back together, and destroy the core once and for all.  
最终，他们两人同时发力，试图将天使重新拼合，并彻底摧毁其核心。_

Shinji opened his eyes to see the German doing her best to keep her mouth closed, her face betraying her emotions in that moment.  
真嗣睁开眼睛，看到那位德国女孩正尽力闭紧嘴巴，她的脸上却流露出那一刻的情感。

"I want you to try with me." He said, holding back a smile.  
“我想让你和我一起试试。”他说着，忍住了一丝微笑。

The girl readied her violin, waiting for him to start.  
女孩准备好小提琴，等待他开始。

"Ever tried ballroom dancing?" he asked, readying his bow as well.  
“试过跳交谊舞吗？”他问道，同时准备好了弓步。

"No, it's not exactly knowledge you want when fighting in EVAs." She snapped back.  
“不，在 EVA 里战斗时可不需要这种知识。”她立刻反驳道。

He shrugged "Well, you have the lead and follower, just try to follow me for right now, alright?"  
他耸耸肩，“好吧，这里有领舞和跟随者，现在就试着跟着我，好吗？”

"I'll take it slow." he explained.  
"我会慢慢来。" 他解释道。

He started, then she did…  
他开始了，接着她也……

"_This is never going to work! How am I supposed to lower my abilities to match this tragic excuse for a pilot?!"_  
"这根本行不通！我怎么可能降低自己的能力来匹配这个糟糕透顶的飞行员？！"

"_Huh, I guess the devil can cry."_  
“呵，看来恶魔也会流泪。”

"_Go after her!"_ "去追她！"

"_Because you just made girl cry! Take responsibility for your actions!"_  
"因为你刚刚把女孩弄哭了！对自己的行为负责！"

In all honesty, Shikinami had done rather well for her first try, but the girl's face was already showing that she was becoming frustrated.  
说实话，式波第一次尝试已经做得相当不错了，但那女孩的脸上已经显露出她正变得沮丧。

"Look, just hold out your hand." He said, another idea coming to mind.  
"听着，只要伸出你的手。" 他一边说，一边脑海中又冒出了另一个主意。

She grumbled but held out her hand, the Third Children just flipped it over so the palm was facing upwards. Cupping it in is left hand, he began to tap into it with his right.  
她嘟囔着，但还是伸出了手，第三子只是将它翻过来，让掌心朝上。他用左手托住，然后用右手开始在其上轻敲。

"_Don't even bother…"_ "别费劲了……"

"_I know what I have to do."_  
"我知道我必须做什么。"

"_All I have left is being an EVA pilot."_  
"我剩下的只有成为 EVA 驾驶员了。"

After the sixty-two seconds, Shinji stopped. Looking at the redhead's face, he figured she was understanding at least some of it.  
在六十二秒后，真嗣停了下来。看着红发女孩的脸，他觉得她至少理解了一些。

"Wanna try again?" “想再试一次吗？”

All he got was a simple nod.  
他得到的只是一个简单的点头。

He readied his bow, eyeing her to see if she was ready.  
他准备好弓箭，盯着她看是否准备好了。

"_We'll show em, Misato and Rei, will be totally blown away by how good we are!"_  
"我们会让他们大吃一惊的，美里和丽，绝对会被我们的厉害震撼到！"

"_I'll show em, they're gonna pay!"_  
"我要让他们见识见识，他们得为此付出代价！"

"_No one gets away from taking a shot at me like that!"_  
"没人能那样对我开枪后全身而退！"

He stopped and smiled, that was pretty good. Even if the German was still getting frustrated by what she perceived as lack of progress.  
他停下脚步，微笑着，感觉还不错。尽管那位德国人仍因她所认为的进展缓慢而感到沮丧。

So, they continued like that, neither one telling the other they wanted to stop. Honestly it would have gone all night if Penn Penn hadn't charged them.  
于是，他们就这样继续下去，谁也没有告诉对方想要停下来。老实说，如果不是企鹅佩恩突然冲过来，他们可能会整晚都这样。

Apparently, the penguin valued his sleep.  
显然，这只企鹅很看重它的睡眠。

**Ah, that's refreshing, gotta love some symbolism. So, I guess you guys will get these before Wednesday, I am really neglecting my schoolwork.  
啊，真是耳目一新，不得不爱这象征意义。看来你们周三前就能收到这些了，我真是疏忽了学业。**

**SHOUTOUTS! 特别鸣谢！**

**Calborghete –  卡尔博格赫特 –**

**dyinglittelstar – I did watch those, I got nothing to say since I already have an outline till the end of the story and I'm still debating reading spoilers, but I will say, Jet Alone doesn't need to have someone actually synced with it since it's not an EVA correct? Just some food for thought.  
dyinglittelstar – 我确实看了那些，没什么可说的，因为我已经有了直到故事结束的大纲，而且我还在犹豫是否要读剧透，但我要说的是，Jet Alone 不需要有人实际同步操作，因为它不是 EVA，对吧？只是一些思考的食物。**

**EVAPilotFair – The thing with Rebuild being movies is you don't get the same 'down time' like you would in NGE, I think it would have been much better being a miniseries instead, probably would have been easier on Anno too.  
EVAPilotFair – 《新世纪福音战士》重制版作为电影的问题在于，你无法获得像原版动画中那样的‘休息时间’，我认为如果它是一部迷你剧集会好得多，对庵野秀明来说可能也会更轻松。**

**A Random Fan – Why yes, yes that was foreshadowing.  
A Random Fan – 没错，那确实是伏笔。**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – Idk, depends on what happens in 3.0+1.0, but at least the dude agreed to go to a dinner and not solely because he wanted to manipulate Shinji.  
UltraSpink of Da USA – 我不确定，这取决于 3.0+1.0 会发生什么，但至少那家伙同意去吃晚餐，并不仅仅是因为他想操纵真嗣。**

**Bwanagator – Thanks! Bwanagator – 谢谢！**

**A Guy – Ah yeah I guess Sahaquel does kinda look like Starro from DC. Though I don't know exactly what you're referencing.  
一个家伙——啊，对，我猜萨哈克尔确实有点像 DC 里的斯塔罗。虽然我不太清楚你具体指的是什么。**

**Alright, I hope everyone is enjoying this so far, hopefully my grades survive writing this.  
好了，希望到目前为止大家都能喜欢，希望我的成绩不会因为写这个而受影响。**

**Until next Time. 下次见。**

### Chapter 20: "…But that girl hasn't met me.…"  
Chapter 20: "…但那个女孩还没遇到我。…"

Shinji just laid there on his side again, the old SDAT player sitting there beside him, but he didn't want to listen to it.  
真嗣只是再次侧身躺在那里，老旧的 SDAT 播放器就放在他旁边，但他并不想听。

"_Oh, you don't need to drown me out anymore?" she was just curled up in the corner, staring at him._  
"哦，你不再需要用音乐淹没我了吗？" 她只是蜷缩在角落里，盯着他看。

No that wasn't it. He felt _good_ after playing music with Shikinami, he had felt _better_.  
不，不是那样的。和式波一起演奏音乐后，他感觉很好，甚至更好了。

Staring at the old player, the Third Children knew nothing good would come of going back to his old habits, but that didn't mean he wasn't tempted by the simplicity of drowning everything out.  
凝视着那台旧播放器，第三适格者知道回到旧习惯不会有什么好事，但这并不意味着他不向往那种简单地淹没一切的感觉。

_Including her. 包括她在内。_

It was a struggle between that feeling of a fake peace and his knowledge that he deserved her torment, he deserved everything she said to him… she was many things, but a liar wasn't one of them.  
这是一种在虚假和平的感觉与他内心深知自己应受她折磨之间的挣扎，他应承受她所说的一切……她有许多特质，但撒谎者绝非其中之一。

At least not anymore, she didn't need to hurt him with false words when she had so many examples of his own failures to remind him of.  
至少现在不是了，当她有那么多他自身失败的例子可以提醒他时，她已无需再用虚假的话语来伤害他。

All he was left with was his own thoughts, at least until his door slid open.  
他只剩下自己的思绪相伴，至少直到他的房门缓缓滑开。

The weight on the other side of the bed told him all he needed to know.  
床另一侧的重量告诉他一切他需要知道的信息。

"Will you just let me lie here for a while, please?" she whispered, once again.  
“你能不能让我就这样躺一会儿，好吗？”她再次低声说道。

He rolled over, perhaps it was foolish, a stupid act that he had already tried, but he rested is arm across her just as he had last time.  
他翻了个身，或许这很愚蠢，一个他已经尝试过的愚蠢举动，但他还是像上次那样，将手臂搭在了她的身上。

The redhead tensed just like before.  
红发女孩像之前一样紧张起来。

But he said nothing, perhaps he didn't need to, this time she asked the question.  
但他什么也没说，也许这次他不需要说，她主动提出了问题。

"You said you piloted the EVAs for a different reason before…"  
"你之前说过，你驾驶 EVA 有不同的理由……"

"Yeah…" "是啊……"

"What was it?" "那是什么？"

He paused, it had been so long, the memory was like a fuzzy TV signal "I think it was so my father would notice me, accept me, want to be part of my life…"  
他顿了顿，那已经是很久以前的事了，记忆如同模糊的电视信号，“我想，是为了让我父亲注意到我，接纳我，愿意成为我生活的一部分……”

"but that was a long time ago."  
“但那是很久以前的事了。”

"Why do you pilot the EVA?" he asked her.  
“你为什么要驾驶 EVA？”他问她。

"I already told you." "我已经告诉过你了。"

"No, you didn't…" "不，你没有……"

"You told me what you tell yourself." He said simply. "that you do it for yourself…"  
"你告诉了我你对自己说的话。"" 他简单地说道，""你这么做是为了你自己……"

She stopped breathing. 她停止了呼吸。

"Don't you see that there's more to life than the EVAs?"  
“你难道看不出生活中还有比 EVA 更重要的东西吗？”

"The EVAs are a dead end Asuka." He said simply "trust me I know… you won't find purpose or happiness in them."  
“EVA 是一条死胡同，明日香。”他简单地说，“相信我，我知道……你在那里找不到目标或幸福。”

"You're lying" she hissed. "You do."  
"你在撒谎" 她低声说道。"你确实如此。"

"No." "不。"

Shinji closed his eyes "I don't find happiness in them… I do it because I have to, because if I don't…"  
真嗣闭上了眼睛 "我从他们身上找不到幸福……我这么做是因为我必须这么做，因为如果我不这么做……"

He stopped; he should choose his words carefully.  
他顿住了；他得斟酌言辞。

"If I could walk away I would."  
“如果我能一走了之，我会的。”

"Then do it" she growled, "walk away!"  
“那就做啊”她咆哮道，“走开！”

"I can't." "我做不到。"

"Why not?!" "为什么不行？！"

.

.

.

"Have you ever heard the Greek myth of humans being created?" Shinji asked her quietly.  
"你听说过希腊神话中人类被创造的故事吗？" 真嗣平静地问她。

"Answer the question" she growled.  
"回答问题" 她咆哮道。

He smiled but continued anyways "The Greeks believed that humans once had two heads, four arms, and four legs."  
他微笑着，但还是继续说道：“古希腊人相信，人类曾经有两个头、四只手臂和四条腿。”

"Zeus, feared their power… so he had them split into two halves."  
“宙斯害怕他们的力量……所以他将他们一分为二。”

"And for the rest of their lives they search for that other half they'd been separated from."  
"而在余生中，他们不断寻找那曾经被分离的另一半。"

"Some people keep looking their whole lives, going out every day looking for that other half, or something close to it, despite the hurt. Some people give up, wanting a life without that pain, but nothing can take its place."  
"有些人终其一生都在寻找，日复一日地外出寻找那另一半，或是与之相近的存在，尽管会受伤。有些人选择放弃，渴望一种没有那种痛苦的生活，但没有什么能取代它的位置。"

.

.

.

"What do you know about pain?" she asked venom dripping from every word.  
“你对痛苦了解多少？”她问道，每个字都带着毒液般的恶意。

"Everything…" he breathed  
"一切……" 他轻声叹息

"No, you don't." she growled turning over to face him, his arm still on her waist with his hand on the small of her back.  
"不，你不懂。" 她低吼着翻身面对他，他的手臂仍环在她腰间，手掌贴在她后背。

He could barely see her face in the darkness, the small amount of moonlight showed him enough though.  
黑暗中，他几乎看不清她的脸，但那微弱的月光已足够让他看清她的轮廓。

She was struggling to find the strength to tell him something. To tell him her story, what had happened to her that had hurt her so much.  
她努力寻找着勇气，想要告诉他一些事情。告诉他她的故事，那些深深伤害了她的经历。

He wanted more than anything to just pull her into an embrace, to tell her that she wasn't alone, to tell her he would do everything he could for her to try to take away her pain.  
他无比渴望能将她拥入怀中，告诉她她并不孤单，告诉她他会尽一切可能为她减轻痛苦。

It hurt him that he couldn't do that, he knew if he reached out too much she would just retreat further. Now was the time to see if she would open up.  
他感到心痛，因为他无法这样做，他知道如果他过于主动，她只会退得更远。现在是时候看看她是否愿意敞开心扉了。

"I guess you know that the Second Impact didn't crush Germany like a lot of other countries, but even we had to face things."  
"我想你知道第二次冲击并没有像摧毁许多其他国家那样摧毁德国，但我们也不得不面对一些事情。"

"The first things I remember are keeping other kids from eating my food, everyone in the orphanage got some, but not enough, the government had bigger problems than giving support to the foster system."  
"我最早的记忆是阻止其他孩子吃我的食物，孤儿院的每个人都有份，但不够，政府有更大的问题，顾不上支持寄养系统。"

"I was there till I was 4 or 5 and then NERV came looking for candidates, they chose me."  
"我在那里一直待到四五岁，然后 NERV 来寻找候选人，他们选了我。"

"All I've ever known is the EVA's, there's nothing for me back in Germany. No parents waiting for me, no family, all I've ever known was being hooked up to sensors and combat training, that's it."  
“我所熟悉的只有 EVA，德国没有值得我回去的东西。没有父母在等我，没有家人，我唯一知道的就是连接传感器和战斗训练，仅此而已。”

He rubbed the small of her back as she spoke, his right hand holding his head up.  
她说话时，他揉着她的后腰，右手托着头。

"Do you know what it's like trying to be the protector of the world, but never live in it?"  
“你知道那种感觉吗？想要守护世界，却从未真正生活在其中。”

_Yes 是的_

"I only pilot because it feels right, it makes me feel complete."  
"我只因为感觉对了才驾驶，它让我感到完整。"

"Do you have that one thing, that makes you complete Shinji?"  
"你有那样一件事吗，让你感到完整，真嗣？"

He just listened to her, letting her tell him about herself, this was probably the first time she had anyone to talk to, or at least wanted to talk to.  
他只是静静地听她讲述，让她畅谈自己的故事，这或许是她第一次有人倾听，或者至少是她愿意倾诉的对象。

_I'm looking at her. 我在看着她。_

"I do." “我愿意。”

She just looked at him, waiting for him to tell her what it was, but he couldn't. He wouldn't tell her it was the redhead staring at him.  
她只是看着他，等待他告诉她那是什么，但他做不到。他不会告诉她那是红发女孩在盯着他。

"Do you ever wonder why?" he asked her, already knowing the answer, but he wanted her to say it, he wanted her to admit it.  
"你有没有想过为什么？" 他问她，虽然已经知道答案，但他想让她说出来，他想让她承认。

"I… I do…" "我……我确实……"

Then… those eyes seemed to catch fire, her face contorting in rage.  
然后……那双眼睛似乎燃起了火焰，她的脸因愤怒而扭曲。

"Why did they leave me there, what didn't they want from me, what did they see in my that they didn't want?" she said through gritted teeth.  
"为什么他们把我留在那里，他们不想要我什么，他们在我身上看到了什么他们不想要的？" 她咬牙切齿地说。

He pulled her closer, wishing he could take that from her, all that pain and anger.  
他把她拉得更近，希望自己能替她承受这一切，所有的痛苦和愤怒。

"It's not your fault." He whispered to her  
"这不是你的错。" 他低声对她说

A dry sob escaped her lips  
她发出一声干涩的抽泣

"It's not your fault." He said again a bit more forcefully.  
"这不是你的错。" 他又说了一遍，语气更加坚定。

"I know idiot…" "我知道，傻瓜……"

He just stared at her, not letting his gaze move from her blue eyes.  
他只是凝视着她，目光始终不曾从她湛蓝的眼眸移开。

"Are you sure?" “你确定吗？”

She said nothing, instead she just pulled herself closer to him, slowly wrapping her arms around him and pulling him closer.  
她一言未发，只是将自己更紧地贴近他，缓缓地用双臂环抱住他，将他拉得更近。

The Third Children wasn't expecting that, but he wasn't going to push her away either.  
第三适格者并未预料到这一幕，但他也无意将她推开。

For a few moments they just laid there, close together, enjoying each other's warmth, Shinji didn't want to break the silence, but he knew she had showed him a piece of herself and he was going to have to do the same.  
有那么一会儿，他们就这样静静地躺在一起，享受着彼此的温暖，真嗣不想打破这份宁静，但他知道她已经向他展示了一部分自己，他也必须做出同样的回应。

"What do you know of that?" she finally whispered.  
"你对那件事了解多少？"她终于低声问道。

.

.

.

"My mother…" he started. He wished he could tell her his story, he wished he could tell her how he had tried to hard to fix everything, how he had tried to save her so many times.  
"我母亲……"他开口道。他多么希望能向她倾诉自己的故事，多么希望能告诉她自己曾多么努力地想要修复一切，曾多少次试图拯救她。

But that wouldn't be fair to her.  
但这对她不公平。

"I had to watch her dissolve into Unit-01's core."  
"我不得不看着她溶解进初号机的核心。"

"And every time I climb in the Entry plug, I'm afraid that I'll never…"  
"而每次我爬进插入栓，我都害怕自己再也无法……"

"Come back out?" she asked, her voice clearly drowsy.  
"出来？" 她问道，声音明显带着困意。"

"That I won't want to." He confessed quietly.  
“我不会想。”他轻声坦白道。

She said nothing, even though he waited patiently for a witty remark.  
她一言不发，尽管他耐心等待着一句机智的评论。

"I don't want to pilot the EVA, I do it because I need to."  
"我不想驾驶 EVA，我这么做是因为我必须这么做。"

"Because if I didn't…" "因为如果我不……"

_This nightmare can't end.  
这场噩梦无法结束。_

"Who would fight the Angels with you?"  
"谁会和你一起对抗使徒？"

Asuka said nothing, the only sound from her being her light breathing.  
明日香一言不发，只有她轻微的呼吸声传来。

"Asuka?" he whispered, wondering if the redhead was listening.  
"明日香？" 他轻声唤道，想知道红发女孩是否在听。

Looking down he could see her eyes were closed, how had she dozed off in the middle of that conversation?  
他低头一看，发现她的眼睛已经闭上了，怎么会在谈话中打起盹来呢？

He looked over to his clock, perhaps the fact it was nearly two in the morning had something to do with it, but he wasn't going to wake her.  
他瞥了一眼时钟，或许是因为快到凌晨两点了，但他不打算叫醒她。

Perhaps it was better that she didn't hear him.  
或许她没听到他更好。

ʡʘʘʢ

_He had come so far.  
他已经走了这么远。_

"_Listen to me Shinji."_ “听我说，真嗣。”

_Only to have this happen.  
结果却发生了这种事。_

_Gendo stood there, in front of Unit-01. Shinji had come to him, dragging the corpse of Unit-00.  
源渡站在初号机前，真嗣拖着零号机的尸体来到他面前。_

_Rei had done everything Gendo had asked, even betraying him, even fighting him to keep him from rescuing Asuka.  
绫波完成了源渡要求的一切，甚至背叛了他，甚至与他战斗以阻止他救出明日香。_

_The pilot of Unit-02 was currently in cuffs, a rather robust set that kept her from moving much.  
二号机的驾驶员目前被铐上了手铐，一副相当结实的镣铐让她无法动弹。_

_Shinji was sure that she'd be kicking and biting the commander of NERV by now if they hadn't put her in such things.  
真嗣确信，如果不是他们给她戴上了这些东西，她现在肯定已经在踢打和咬 NERV 的指挥官了。_

_Of course, it could also be the collar around her neck, and the fact that Gendo was currently holding the detonator in his hand.  
当然，也可能是她脖子上的项圈，以及碇源堂现在手里正拿着起爆器这一事实。_

_Another thing he could thank Ritsuko for, just another thing to add to the list really.  
他又可以感谢律子了，这不过是清单上的又一项罢了。_

_One day he'd… 有一天他会……_

"_This isn't the only detonator, but if you don't exit Unit-01 in under 60 seconds, I will make sure the other ones won't be used."_  
“这并非唯一的引爆器，但如果你不在 60 秒内离开初号机，我会确保其他引爆器无法使用。”

_If he did what the man said Shinji was sure he'd be killed, that gun in his hand made that a very real outcome.  
如果他按照那人的话去做，碇真嗣确信自己会被杀，那人手中的枪让这一结果变得极为真实。_

_If he didn't… he knew Gendo would do it, there wasn't anything he wasn't willing to do.  
如果他不这么做……他知道碇源堂会这么做，没有什么是他不愿意做的。_

_Shinji could advert the Third Impact, right here, he could stop this, hopefully, if there_ was _a stopping this…_  
真嗣可以阻止第三次冲击，就在这里，他可以停止这一切，希望如此，如果真的能停止的话……

_But he'd have to watch her die… again.  
但他必须再次看着她死去……_

_That… he wasn't willing to do.  
这一点……他不愿意去做。_

_She was the only one, the only thing he wasn't willing to let go of.  
她是唯一，是他不愿放手的唯一存在。_

_He wouldn't fail her again; he couldn't let her die again.  
他不会再让她失望；他不能让她再次死去。_

_Even if he stopped the Third Impact and this all stopped, if she wasn't there…  
即便他阻止了第三次冲击，一切就此停止，如果她不在了……_

_What was the point? 这有什么意义呢？_

_Hitting the release, the had to watch the screen turn black as the LCL drained from the system.  
按下释放键，他不得不看着屏幕变黑，LCL 从系统中排空。_

_Out and hopping down he walked up to the man, still drenched in LCL, Asuka just looked at him, he could tell she was doing her best not to say anything, but her eyes told him that even she didn't know what to do.  
他走出来，跳下，向那个男人走去，依然浑身湿透的 LCL。明日香只是看着他，他能看出她在尽力不说话，但她的眼神告诉他，连她也不知道该怎么办。_

"_You win." He said simply "but…"_  
"你赢了。" 他简单地说，"但是……"

"_what is it?"_ "这是什么？"

_He looked at the girl, not wanting to look at his father when he said the words.  
他看着女孩，不想在说出这些话时看向自己的父亲。_

"_If our roles were reversed, and she was Yui…"_  
"如果我们的角色互换，而她是唯……"

_He didn't even have to finish the sentence as the gunshot rang out and his world went black.  
他甚至不必说完那句话，随着枪声响起，他的世界陷入了一片黑暗。_

ʡʘʘʢ

The Second Child opened her eyes to the dimly lit room. It had to be very early in the morning judging by the small amount of sunlight coming into the room.  
第二适格者睁开双眼，发现自己身处昏暗的房间。根据透进来的微弱阳光判断，这必定是清晨时分。

A shiver when through her, that warmth she had felt next to the Third Child was gone, so was the comfortable hand that had wrapped around her.  
她感到一阵寒意袭来，那种紧挨着第三适格者时的温暖已不复存在，那只曾环绕着她的舒适之手也消失了。

That had to be the best sleep she had gotten in years, a dreamless sleep where there was nothing to torment her.  
那无疑是她多年来睡得最香甜的一觉，无梦的睡眠，没有任何事物来折磨她。

Slowly pushing herself up she looked over to only see the other side of the bed empty.  
她缓缓撑起身，转头望去，只见床的另一侧空空如也。

Confusion wracked her brain and then panic as to why he left her, only for her to be startled by his quiet voice.  
困惑在她脑海中蔓延，随即是恐慌，不明白他为何离开她，直到被他轻柔的声音吓了一跳。

"Go back to bed Asuka."  
“回床上睡觉去，明日香。”

She saw him, there in the corner that was still cast in shadow, curled up with his knees to his chest.  
她看见他，就在那个仍被阴影笼罩的角落里，蜷缩着身体，双膝紧贴胸前。

Why had he left her?  
他为何要离开她？

"What are you doing over there Ikari?" she growled, thought its effect was dulled due to her grogginess.  
"碇，你在那边做什么？"她咆哮道，但由于昏昏沉沉的状态，效果大打折扣。

She could only see his eyes over the top of his knees, he just looked at her, but she couldn't detect any emotion from him.  
她只能看到他膝盖上方的那双眼睛，他只是看着她，但她无法从他脸上察觉到任何情绪。

"Just go back to sleep, I'll be fine, I didn't mean to wake you."  
"继续睡吧，我没事的，我不是有意吵醒你的。"

"Third…" she growled, obviously not liking the answer.  
“第三……”她咆哮道，显然对这个答案很不满意。

He said nothing, just looked at her.  
他一言不发，只是看着她。

"I didn't want to wake you with… my dreams." He admitted, "I'll be right back."  
"我不想用……我的梦吵醒你。" 他坦白道，"我马上回来。"

Those eyes pleaded with her to lay back down she kept searching for something other than the truth, something other than his word that he'd be there when she woke up again.  
那双眼睛恳求她躺回去，她却一直在寻找除了真相之外的东西，寻找除了他保证会在她再次醒来时在那里的承诺之外的东西。

In the end she let herself trust him, against every instinct that was shouting at her that he as lying. She rested her head on her pillow again and trusted that he'd be there when she opened her eyes for the second time.  
最终，她让自己相信了他，尽管每一个本能都在尖叫着他在撒谎。她再次将头枕在枕头上，相信当他第二次睁开眼睛时，他会在那里。

The boy just watched her lay back down, her chest rising and falling slowly.  
男孩只是看着她再次躺下，胸膛缓缓地起伏。

How could he even be near her? How could he even hold her? Resting next to her no longer took away his nightmares, that one thing that could let him sleep at night had long since been stripped from him, leaving the boy to only disturb the girl. Even Misato's comfort the first night he had come here had only given him slight relief.  
他怎么能靠近她？他怎么能拥抱她？躺在她身边不再驱散他的噩梦，那个曾让他夜晚安眠的东西早已被夺走，留下男孩只能打扰女孩。就连美里在他刚来这里的第一晚给予的安慰也只给他带来了一丝慰藉。

"_Sucks to be you, at least you get to sleep at all." The one-eyed redhead mumbled as she sat next to him._  
“你至少还能睡得着，真惨。”独眼的红发女孩嘟囔着坐在他旁边。

ʡʘʘʢ

"Don't leave me again, ok?" she asked him as she awoke with the familiar weight on her waist.  
"别再离开我了，好吗？" 她醒来时，腰间熟悉的重量让她问道。

He said nothing, just the feeling of the boy's chest stop its raising and lowering was enough to let her know he heard her  
他什么也没说，只是男孩胸膛的起伏停止了，这足以让她知道他听到了她的话。

"Promise me." She pleaded.  
"答应我。" 她恳求道。

"I promise." "我保证。"

**So the problem (as of 3.0) is that Shikinami doesn't have a backstory, we don't get anything of substance, so how do we create a past that explains the differences between the two Asuka's?  
因此，问题在于（截至 3.0 版本），式波没有背景故事，我们无法获得任何实质性内容，那么我们该如何创造一个过去，来解释两位明日香之间的差异呢？**

**Shikinami doesn't seem to want attention (socially), but she is much more overt in her feelings towards Shinji (probably b/c Anno was just trying to create a love triangle idk), she has her WonderSwan which mirrors Shinji's SDAT player, but feels that she is 'above' childish things like going to an aquarium. Stir that together and I see an orphan who didn't even know her parents, who feels they are more mature than everyone else (like Soryu), but craves love more overtly than Soryu does (even though she doesn't go after Kaji) because she had never felt it (she crawls into bed with him and even talks with him unlike Soryu did). She's not nearly as mean to Shinji because there is no 'I see myself in you'. So overall, an Asuka that's not nearly as traumatized as Soryu, because she never felt that love Soryu did from her mother nor the pain of watching her mother go insane and kill herself (plus no fear of dolls). That being said, what would happen if she found something like that, only to have it ripped away… food for thought.  
式波似乎并不渴望社交上的关注，但她对真嗣的感情却表现得更为明显（可能是因为庵野只是想创造一个爱情三角关系，我不确定）。她有自己的 WonderSwan，与真嗣的 SDAT 播放器相呼应，但她觉得去水族馆这类孩子气的事情是‘高于’她的。综合来看，我觉得她是一个孤儿，连自己的父母都不了解，感觉自己比其他人更成熟（像惣流一样），但比惣流更明显地渴望爱（尽管她没有像惣流那样追求加持），因为她从未感受过爱（她会爬上他的床，甚至与他交谈，不像惣流那样）。她对真嗣并不那么刻薄，因为没有‘我在你身上看到了自己’的感觉。总的来说，她不像惣流那样受到创伤，因为她从未感受到惣流从母亲那里得到的爱，也没有目睹母亲发疯并自杀的痛苦（加上没有对玩偶的恐惧）。话虽如此，如果她找到了类似的东西，却又被夺走，那会怎样呢……值得深思。**

**SHOUTOUTS! 特别鸣谢！**

**Bwanagator – Oh, would you look at that…  
Bwanagator – 哦，你瞧瞧这个……**

**EvaPilotFair – One thing about old habits is they are hard to kill, especially if they are picked back up again.  
EvaPilotFair – 关于旧习惯，有一点是它们很难被根除，尤其是当它们再次被拾起时。**

**Some Fella – Thanks! I'm trying to look at it as if Soryu would have been more like Shinji, well a violent version of NGE Shinji, but it's hard since we don't really know anything about her.  
某位伙计 – 谢谢！我试着从 Soryu 的角度来看，如果她更像 Shinji，嗯，一个暴力的《新世纪福音战士》版本的 Shinji，但很难，因为我们对她了解不多。**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – That's true, hopefully 3.0+1.0 clears that up for us, the whole system of how Impacts work and effects from it is different so it's a bit confusing with the lack of material to draw conclusions from.  
美国超斯宾克 – 确实如此，希望《3.0+1.0》能为我们澄清这一点，冲击的整个系统和其影响都不同，所以在缺乏材料的情况下得出结论有点混乱。**

**Spaztasticdragoon – Thanks, can we get a 'Vote for Hikari' shirt?  
斯帕兹塔斯蒂克龙 – 谢谢，我们能得到一件‘为 Hikari 投票’的 T 恤吗？**

**Guest (I'm guessing it's A Guy) – I'm pretty sure the N2 mine only slowed it down but wouldn't have been able to stop it. Considering it didn't damage the core.  
访客（我猜是个男的）——我相当确定 N2 地雷只是减缓了它的速度，但无法阻止它。考虑到它并未损伤核心。**

**I kinda wish Rebuild would have been slower, just so we could have waited for this, but unfortunately judging by Gendo's return from his trip to the moon and Unit-00 not being available for the fight against the Ninth Angel, we really don't have more than a 2-3 weeks, but I do believe that Shikinami would come back to Shinji if he had reached out, after all she starts learning how to cook when she learns about Rei's plan.  
我有点希望《新剧场版》能放慢节奏，这样我们就能等到这个了，但不幸的是，从碇源堂从月球归来以及零号机无法参与对抗第九使徒的战斗来看，我们真的没有超过两三周的时间，不过我相信，如果真希波能回到真嗣身边，毕竟她在得知绫波的计划后开始学习烹饪。**

**Until Next Time 下次再见**

### Chapter 21: "...You're face, to face …"  
Chapter 21: "...你面对面…"

Shinji just let himself stare into the blue sky.  
真嗣只是让自己凝视着蓝天。

Resting next to him, his SDAT player was unused, but still close by. He knew he should destroy it; he should smash it into a million pieces.  
静静躺在他身旁，那台 SDAT 播放器未曾启用，却依旧触手可及。他知道应该毁掉它；应该将其砸成无数碎片。

But somehow, if he did that, it felt like he would be destroying another piece of himself.  
但不知为何，那样做的话，感觉就像是在摧毁自己的另一部分。

Right now, he needed to get away from everyone for a bit, even though he wasn't really breaking any rules, he was sure that if he was found out there would be some scolding.  
此刻，他需要暂时远离所有人，尽管并未违反任何规定，但他确信，若被发现，定会招来一番责备。

It didn't matter. 这无关紧要。

He just needed to think…  
他只需要思考……

The girl had been distant the moment she walked out of his door. Luckily, Misato was in the shower, but even throughout the day she hardly said anything to him. Even only a passing 'thank you' for lunch.  
女孩一走出他的门，就变得疏远了。幸运的是，美里在洗澡，但即便是一整天，她几乎没对他说什么。甚至只是午饭时随口的一句‘谢谢’。

He was alright with that, if she wanted to keep up her image to everyone else that was fine with him, to her this was novel, having someone truly care about her.  
他对此并不介意，如果她想在别人面前保持形象，他觉得挺好，对她来说，这是新奇的体验，有人真正关心她。

Her… 她的……

Asuka Langley Shikinami 式波·明日香·兰格雷

She had told him her story; she had confided in him. An orphan taken in by NERV.  
她已经向他倾诉了自己的故事；她向他吐露了心声。一个被 NERV 收养的孤儿。

The boy's head still couldn't figure it out. She wasn't lying, he was sure of that. Just by her tone of voice and struggle to tell he knew that was the truth. Part of him hated himself for even thinking she would lie about that.  
男孩的脑袋还是无法理解这一切。他确信她没有撒谎。仅凭她的语气和讲述时的挣扎，他就知道那是真的。他的一部分甚至痛恨自己竟然会怀疑她在这种事上撒谎。

What puzzled him was the fact that she still could pilot Unit-02.  
让他困惑的是，她竟然还能驾驶二号机。

If she was an orphan… who was inside Unit-02?  
如果她是个孤儿……那么驾驶二号机的人又是谁？

Unless maybe she was too young to be there for her mother's death…  
除非或许她当时年纪太小，不记得母亲去世的情景……

Maybe her mother was absorbed into Unit-02's core in this life just like his own mother, only for her father to send her away.  
也许她的母亲就像他自己的母亲一样，在这一世被吸收进了二号机的核心，而她的父亲随后将她送走。

Judging by her father's neglect in his original life that could make sense, though it was a step even beyond what Gendo had done to him.  
从她父亲在前世中的忽视来看，这说得通，尽管这甚至超过了碇源堂对他所做的。

But there was one silver lining, despite everything she had gone through, here Asuka was not nearly as troubled as his first life.  
但有一线希望，尽管她经历了这一切，在这里，明日香远没有他第一世时那么困扰。

"_She doesn't know what it's like…" Soryu said, sitting next to him with her knees to her chest._  
“她不知道那是什么感觉……”索朗说，坐在他旁边，双膝抱在胸前。

"_She's always been alone; she doesn't know what it's like to be…"_  
"她总是独自一人；她不知道被……是什么感觉。"

"Loved." Shinji said, completing her sentence.  
"爱。" 真嗣说道，补全了她的句子。

Then again… there was a flipside to that particular coin.  
不过……凡事都有两面性。

She had never truly felt that loss either. Loneliness sure, that emptiness that nothing could fill, but the loss of someone she loved and the pain that comes with them being ripped from you…  
她从未真正感受过那种失去。孤独感是有的，那种无法填补的空虚，但失去所爱之人以及随之而来的痛苦，那种被生生夺走的痛楚……

Perhaps it was better that she never met him after all.  
也许，她终究从未遇见他，反而是件好事。

"_You're going to have to stay alive this time, don't want to be creating a Soryu out of a Shikinami."_  
“这次你得好好活下去，我可不想把一个式波变成一个绫波。”

"_You better not let her turn out like me…"_  
"你最好别让她变得像我一样……"

God… if he were responsible for that…  
天啊……如果那都是他的责任……

"_Honestly, what are you even doing Third?"_  
"说实话，Third，你到底在干什么？"

"Is that supposed to be a joke?"  
"你这是在开玩笑吗？"

"_No, how many chances do you think you'll get, how long until this just eats you? At some point you're going to break."_  
"不，你以为你还有多少机会，还要多久这东西就会把你吞噬？总有一天你会崩溃的。"

"I already did." He mumbled.  
"我已经崩溃了。" 他喃喃道。"

_She said nothing, just stretching out and laying down next to him while staring at the sky.  
她一言不发，只是伸展开身体，躺在他身旁，凝视着天空。_

"_I still have whiplash from those lives…" she said softly, a slight pain in her voice._  
"那些生活至今仍让我感到颈部酸痛……"她轻声说道，声音中带着一丝痛楚。

Shinji said nothing, not wanting to remember those… unpleasant times. When the weight of his failure had been too much to bear.  
真嗣没有说话，不想回忆那些……不愉快的时光。那时他失败的沉重负担，实在是难以承受。

Luckily, a high-pitched shriek tore him from those thoughts.  
幸运的是，一声尖锐的尖叫将他从这些思绪中拉了出来。

"LOOK OUT!" "小心！"

To be fair, he wasn't expecting to be landed on by someone parachuting from the sky, but that was exactly what happened. How they had managed to land directly on him was completely baffling to him.  
说来也怪，他本没料到会有人从天而降砸到自己身上，但事情就这么发生了。他们究竟是如何准确无误地落在他身上的，这让他完全摸不着头脑。

And he was being smothered by… oh that's what those were.  
而且他正被……哦，原来那是……

Air, he needed air. 空气，他需要空气。

As the person pulled back Shinji sucked air into his lungs, doing his best to catch his breath and there in front of him, _on him_, sat an unfamiliar brunette.  
当那人退开后，真嗣拼命吸入空气，努力调整呼吸，而眼前，或者说压在他身上的，是一位陌生的棕发女孩。

It was bizarre, it almost looked like she was dressed in a school uniform, though not one that belonged in Japan. A loose tie hung around her neck with a crest over the left side of her chest.  
这情景颇为怪异，她看起来像是穿着校服，但并非日本常见的款式。一条松散的领带挂在她脖子上，左侧胸前还有一个徽章。

For a moment Shinji just stared at the girl who in turn did the same, before she reached up to her face, a sudden look of concern washing over her.  
有那么一会儿，真嗣只是盯着那个女孩，而她也同样回望着他，随后她伸手摸向自己的脸，突然间流露出担忧的神情。

Getting off him, she crawled around on her hands and knees mumbling about glasses, he just watched as the girl crawled around, tearing up her what appeared to be thigh high socks and disregarding any embarrassment from what she was revealing with that pleated skirt while positioned like that.  
她从他身上下来，手脚并用四处爬行，嘴里嘟囔着关于眼镜的事情，他只是看着那女孩四处爬动，撕扯着看似过膝袜的衣物，丝毫不顾及那条百褶裙在这样的姿势下会暴露什么。

Who the hell parachuted in a skirt?  
到底是谁会穿着裙子跳伞啊？

And were those A-10 clips on her headband?  
她头带上的那些是 A-10 弹药夹吗？

_Even Soryu was looking back and forth from him to the girl, gripped with confusion, completely unsure of what to say.  
就连 Soryu 也在他和小女孩之间来回看，满是困惑，完全不知道该说什么。_

"_I'm not the one hallucinating, now am I?"_  
“现在不是我在幻觉中，对吧？”

Finally finding her glasses, she turned back to the boy, "Ah, I'm sorry, are you alright?"  
终于找到她的眼镜，她转回对男孩说：“啊，对不起，你还好吗？”

The Third Children didn't even have a chance to reply when a dull beeping started to emit from a bag that had been attached to her parachute.  
第三适格者还没来得及回答，一阵沉闷的哔哔声就从她降落伞上挂着的包里传了出来。

Ruffling around, the girl found her the phone that was wringing as she began to fold up her the mess that that she had used to land.  
女孩一边摸索着找到正在响的手机，一边开始折叠她用来着陆的那团乱糟糟的东西。

"Hello this is Mari," “你好，我是玛丽，”

"Yeah, the wind picked up and took me off target,"  
“是啊，风突然大了，把我吹偏了目标，”

"It looks like I landed on a school of some sort,"  
“看起来我落到了一所学校之类的地方，”

"What?" “什么？”

"Well, you told me to enter into Japan covertly,"  
"好吧，你让我秘密潜入日本，"

"That's not my problem that's for you and the euro people to work out,"  
"这不是我的问题，那是你和欧洲人需要解决的，"

"Just be there for my extraction, ok thanks!"  
就在那儿等我撤离，好吗？谢谢！

She snapped the phone shut, as Shinji brought himself to his feet. That was a British accent… this just kept getting stranger.  
她啪地一声合上手机，而真嗣挣扎着站起身来。那是英式口音……事情变得越来越奇怪了。

This girl… he had never seen her before, not once in the countless times he'd been alive, and that really did not sit well with him.  
这个女孩……他从未见过她，在他无数次的生命中一次也没有，这让他感到非常不安。

"Look, don't tell anyone you saw me." She said as she packed in the rest of her parachute and walking over to him.  
“听着，别告诉任何人你见过我。”她说着，将剩下的降落伞收拾好，朝他走去。

Leaning in she went up to the side of his face and took a few sniffs.  
她凑近他的脸旁，轻轻嗅了几下。

"_Alright, this is too weird." Soryu said, still laying on the ground, her eye narrowing at the pig-tailed brunette._  
“好吧，这太奇怪了。”Soryu 说道，依旧躺在地上，眼睛眯起盯着那位扎着马尾的棕发女孩。

"Hmm," she said pulling back "You smell good, like LCL,"  
“嗯，”她退后一步说，“你闻起来不错，像 LCL 一样。”

"one of my favorite smells in the world."  
"这是我最喜欢的世界上的味道之一。"

Shinji had never met a normal person who 'liked' that smell. To him that was a major red flag, that was all he needed.  
真嗣从未遇到过喜欢那种气味的人。对他来说，这已经是一个重大警告信号，这就足够了。

"Shinji Ikari, Pilot of Evangelion Unit-01" he said, his hand reaching out.  
“碇真嗣，初号机驾驶员”他说着，伸出手来。

She paled, "Um," she didn't have any words, but she reached out her hand to meet his.  
她脸色苍白，“呃，”她无言以对，但还是伸出手去与他相握。

Now it was his turn, without warning he pulled her close to him again earing a small yelp from the girl.  
现在轮到他了，没有预兆地，他再次将她拉近，女孩发出了一声小小的惊呼。

Bringing his mouth next to her ear, he figured this was an issue best delt with now.  
他将嘴凑近她的耳边，心想这个问题最好现在就解决。

"I don't know your face, and I know lots of people's faces, it's kinda my thing."  
“我不认识你，而我认识很多人的脸，这算是我的特长。”

The audible gulp was an indication his point was going to come across clearly.  
那明显的吞咽声表明他的观点即将清晰传达。

"If you pose a threat to my friends, if you so much as _insinuate_ something happening to them that could be _perceived_ as inconvenient, I will end you." He said slowly and deliberately.  
“如果你对我朋友构成威胁，哪怕只是暗示对他们不利，我会让你付出代价。”他缓慢而明确地说道。

The girl said nothing, just waiting for him to release his vice grip on her hand.  
女孩一言不发，只是等待着他松开那紧握她手腕的钳制。

"Have you ever seen someone's head popped off like the cork of a champagne bottle?" he asked, not releasing his grip on her hand, the memory of the first 'person' he killed coming to mind.  
"你见过有人像香槟瓶塞一样被爆头吗？" 他问道，没有松开握住她的手，脑海中浮现出他杀死的第一个'人'的记忆。

She just shook her head slightly.  
她只是微微摇了摇头。

"Do you want to find out?"  
"你想试试吗？"

Again, she said nothing and just shook her head.  
她再次沉默，只是摇了摇头。

"Good," he said in a more cheerful manner.  
“很好，”他以一种更愉快的语气说道。

Letting her hand go she just stumbled back and turned to walk away, looking behind every once and awhile to just see him there, arms crossed, his words still lingering.  
松开她的手，她只是踉跄后退，转身走开，不时回头望去，只见他双臂交叉站在那里，话语依旧萦绕在耳边。

"_You know Baka," Asuka spoke up from the ground "I do love it when you get a little mean."_  
"你知道吗，笨蛋，" 明日香从地上开口道，"我挺喜欢你偶尔变得有点刻薄的时候。"

ʡʘʘʢ

Kaji had found the kid just sitting and working on homework in GeoFront. He seemed normal enough from a distance, though it was alittle odd that he didn't have his headphones in with his SDAT player sitting next to him.  
加持发现那孩子正坐在 GeoFront 里做作业。从远处看，他似乎很正常，不过有点奇怪的是，他并没有戴着耳机，而 SDAT 播放器就放在他旁边。

Coming up from behind the man peered over the shoulder of the 14-year old, trying to catch a glimpse of his work.  
加持从背后走近，俯身越过 14 岁少年的肩膀，试图瞥一眼他的作业。

From what he could tell, it was flawless, even if the handwriting was sloppy as all hell, but who was he to judge.  
从他能看出的部分来说，这份报告完美无缺，尽管字迹潦草得一塌糊涂，但他又有何资格评判呢。

Brining the can of coffee up to his ear in a bit to startle the Third Child, he frowned at the response he got, or the lack there of.  
他将那罐咖啡举到耳边，试图吓唬一下这位第三适格者，却对收到的回应——或者说缺乏回应——皱起了眉头。

"I'm guessing it's either Misato or Kaji behind me." he mumbled.  
“我猜不是美里就是加持在我后面。”他喃喃自语道。

Not getting an answer the boy shrugged "Kaji it is then."  
男孩没有得到回答，耸了耸肩，“那就叫他加治吧。”

Turning to face the man, Kaji got a good look at the boy. He seemed healthy, the man could spot nothing out of the 'normal', if there was such a thing for Evangelion pilots.  
转过身面对那人，加持好好打量了一番那男孩。他看起来很健康，加持看不出有什么‘异常’，如果对于 EVA 驾驶员来说有所谓正常的话。

"Hey, why don't we go on a date sometime?" he asked with a smile.  
“嘿，我们哪天去约会怎么样？”他笑着问道。

The boy just frowned "So I guess Misato and you have a thing for younger men then?"  
男孩只是皱了皱眉，“所以我想，美里和你都喜欢年纪小的男人？”

Later, quite a few NERV personal would be filing reports of someone or something disturbing the peace around that time, citing a rather loud shouting from a twenty-something male.  
后来，不少 NERV 人员会上报称，那段时间附近有人或物扰乱了安宁，据称是一名二十多岁的男性发出了相当响亮的喊叫声。

ʡʘʘʢ

"Your hobby?" Shinji asked as he pulled out another bundle of weeds.  
"你的爱好吗？" 真嗣问道，同时又拔出了一捆杂草。

"Yeah, you know you've got a talent for this." The man commented noting just how much more work he had gotten out of the boy that he originally thought he would have.  
"是啊，你知道你在这方面很有天赋。" 男人评论道，注意到他从男孩那里得到了比最初预想更多的劳动成果。

"My teacher had a garden, so I'm used to this." The boy explained, which Kaji could believe, but it still sounded like an excuse.  
"我的老师有一个花园，所以我习惯了这些。" 男孩解释说，尽管加治可以相信，但这听起来仍然像是一个借口。

Looking over, the scruffy man just smiled "Is that so? Personally, I love growing things, gives you a greater perspective the world, a chance to sort things out, remind you to just enjoy life."  
那邋遢男子望过来，只是微笑道：“是吗？我个人非常喜欢种植，它能让你以更广阔的视角看待世界，有机会整理思绪，提醒你享受生活。”

"So, it helps you forget the pain." Shinji asked, no, _stated_ to his partner in gardening.  
“所以，它能帮你忘却痛苦。”真嗣对他的园艺伙伴说，不，是陈述。

"Not a big fan of pain?" Kaji asked.  
“不太喜欢痛苦？”卡吉问道。

Shinji sighed "Depends on the pain."  
真嗣叹了口气：“这取决于疼痛的程度。”

The man raised an eyebrow "What do you mean?"  
男人挑了挑眉：“你是什么意思？”

Looking over at the kid he got the same feeling he had when they had gone on that fieldtrip, the same feeling that the kid wanted to share something about himself but was wrestling between hiding it and showing to him.  
他瞥向那孩子，心中涌起一种似曾相识的感觉，就像他们那次去实地考察时一样，那孩子似乎想分享一些关于自己的事情，却又在隐藏与展示之间挣扎。

"I think they're two types of pain." The teenager replied.  
"我认为疼痛有两种。" 少年回答道。

"Physical," he said, looking down at a cut that he had collected on his hand "its sharp, sudden, but it'll almost always fade, I can deal with that…"  
"身体上的，" 他说着，低头看向手上的一处伤口，"它尖锐、突然而至，但几乎总会消退，我能应付……"

He just stood up, still looking at his hand.  
他只是站起身，依旧注视着自己的手。

"and then there's the pain that doesn't heal by itself, you can't get if from a cut or scrape, it stays forever even if it dulls." He said looking out over the GeoFront.  
"然后有一种痛苦是无法自行愈合的，你无法从割伤或擦伤中得到它，它会永远存在，即使它变得迟钝。" 他说着，目光投向了 GeoFront。

Kaji frowned; this kid was way too young to be dealing with these feelings.  
加持皱了皱眉；这个孩子太年轻了，不该承受这些情感。

"But…" Shinji's voice seemed stuck in his throat "it can heal, you just have to…"  
"但是…" 真嗣的声音似乎卡在了喉咙里 "它可以愈合，你只需要…"

.

.

.

This, Kaji was interested in his answer "What do you have to do Shinji?"  
对此，加持对答案很感兴趣：“你有什么要做的吗，真嗣？”

"Healing that pain, those wounds, _that_ pain puts physical pain to shame, that pain is the one that people…"  
“治愈那份痛苦，那些创伤，那份痛苦让肉体的疼痛都相形见绌，那份痛苦是人们……”

He looked down. 他低头看去。

"…kill themselves over?" Kaji asked, filling that question.  
“…为了什么而自寻短见？”加持问道，填补了那个疑问。

God, he hoped he was wrong.  
天啊，他希望自己是错的。

"Shinji…" “真嗣……”

"I'm alright…" Shinji stood up, while Kaji just knelt there in the dirt.  
“我还好……” 真嗣站了起来，而加持只是跪在泥土中。

In that moment, he felt so small, it seemed for some reason this kid was a towering object, so big and complex that the older man wouldn't have a chance to understand him.  
那一刻，他感到自己如此渺小，不知为何，这个孩子仿佛成了一个高耸的庞然大物，如此巨大而复杂，让年长的男人觉得自己无法理解他。

But he could try… 但他可以尝试……

"Shinji, she did it because of her own choice, not yours." Kaji said.  
"真嗣，她这么做是出于自己的选择，不是你的。" 加持说。

The boy just stared out over the GeoFront, silent for a few moments, before he responded.  
男孩只是凝视着地底都市，沉默了片刻，然后才回应。

"No… when we talked… I told you the truth, but it wasn't everything."  
"不……当我们交谈时……我告诉了你真相，但那并不是全部。"

The man looked at him confused, what more to the story could there be?  
那人困惑地看着他，故事还能有什么更多的内容呢？

"The worst part is… that I ran… then I understood… and a piece of me was happy that I hurt her, it made me happy after everything she did to me…"  
“最糟糕的是……我逃走了……然后我明白了……我的一部分竟然因为伤害了她而感到高兴，她对我所做的一切之后，这让我感到快乐……”

"but then… I came _back_."  
但后来……我回来了。

"I tried again and again, I had so many chances to get her to understand _me_, to take that leap of faith with me,"  
"我一次又一次地尝试，有那么多机会让她理解我，与我一起跨越那信念的一跃，"

"that pain of healing, that cut that only scabs over but never heals, and the pain that comes from healing it…"  
"那种愈合的痛苦，那道伤口只是结痂却从未真正愈合，以及来自愈合它的痛苦……"

"well… I thought maybe… maybe it just wasn't worth it, maybe I could make her believe she didn't need me… that the pain she felt wasn't worth it for her."  
"嗯……我想或许……也许这不值得，也许我能让她相信她不需要我……她所感受到的痛苦对她来说并不值得。"

"Maybe she would just be better off without me…"  
"也许没有我，她会过得更好……"

"So, I rejected her, I told her that I couldn't help her, that I wasn't going to understand her… that she could never be happy with me."  
"所以，我拒绝了她，我告诉她我帮不了她，我无法理解她……她和我在一起永远不会幸福。"

"And that was my fault, _she_ was my fault…"  
"这都是我的错，她是我的错……"

"I did terrible things." He confessed. "To her, to myself, everyone… things that I'm still paying for."  
"我做了可怕的事情。" 他坦白道。"对她，对我自己，对每个人……那些我至今仍在偿还的罪行。"

Kaji just stayed crouched there, unable to say anything, or more likely not wanting to say anything.  
加持只是蹲在那里，说不出话来，或者更可能是不想说什么。

"I have dreams, every night about it, usually I fail over and over, but the worst…"  
"我每晚都做梦，梦见那些事，通常是一次又一次的失败，但最糟糕的是……"

"The worst are when I save her and she forgives me, she accepts me… only for her to die for no good reason one I can't even control."  
"最糟糕的是，当我救了她，她原谅我，接受我……结果她却毫无理由地死去，那种我无法控制的情况。"

He sucked in a breath.  
他深吸了一口气。

"To heal _that_ pain…" "为了治愈那份痛苦……"

"What do you have to do Shinji?"  
"你得做什么，真嗣？"

He turned to him, a slight sad smile on his face.  
他转向他，脸上带着一丝悲伤的微笑。

"You know… when you're with Misato, those quiet moments together… and you talk about your brother…"  
"你知道……当你和美里在一起时，那些安静的时刻……你们谈论你的哥哥……"

Kaji's heart went cold, his body petrified at that last word.  
加治的心瞬间凉了半截，听到那最后一个词时，身体僵硬如石。

Turning, the boy looked at the man with those eyes he had seen on their trip. The ones that looked as if had seen too much.  
男孩转过身，用他们在旅途中见过的那种眼神看着男人，那种仿佛经历了太多沧桑的眼神。

"How do you know about that?" he tried to keep himself from growling, but this was suddenly a very different dance the two were having.  
“你怎么知道那件事的？”他努力压抑着咆哮的冲动，但这场对话突然变得截然不同了。

"I know lots of things."  
"我知道很多事情。"

"Only one other person knows about that." The man said lowly.  
"只有另一个人知道这件事。" 那人低声说道。"

"If you think Misato told me you're a damn fool, and really shouldn't be working as a triple agent."  
"如果你认为 Misato 告诉了我，那你真是个十足的傻瓜，实在不适合当三重间谍。"

Kaji's breathing stopped, his eyes widened, with those words the boy had suddenly ceased to be Shinji Ikari, the person in front of him was a completely unknown variable…  
加持的呼吸停滞了，他的眼睛睁大，随着这些话，那个男孩突然不再是碇真嗣，站在他面前的是一个完全未知的变数……

A threat. 一个威胁。

"I can see those gears turning in your head, who does this kid work for…"  
"我能看见你脑中的齿轮在转动，这孩子为谁工作呢……"

"NERV?" "NERV？"

"The UN?" "联合国？"

"The JSDF?" "日本自卫队？"

.

.

.

"SEELE?" “SEELE？”

Kaji's heart was racing. 加治的心跳加速了。

Did the kid not know about him and the IPEA?  
难道这孩子不知道他和 IPEA 的关系吗？

The kid said those names with extreme ease, they just rolled off his tongue as he looked back at the man who now knew this wasn't a normal conversation anymore.  
那孩子轻松地说出那些名字，它们就像自然而然地从他舌尖滑落，同时他回头看着那个现在已经明白这不是一场普通对话的男人。

"Who are you really?" Kaji's eyes narrowed, his grip on his trowel a little too tight.  
"你究竟是谁？" 加持的眼睛眯了起来，他手中的泥刀握得有些过紧。

"Shinji Ikari, The Third Children, Pilot of Evangelion Unit-01." The way he said those words… was it robotic? No, not quite.  
"碇真嗣，第三适格者，EVA 初号机的驾驶员。" 他说这些话的方式……是机械般的吗？不，又不太像。

And what was with that wording? 'Children'?  
而且那种措辞是怎么回事？'适格者'？

"You're digging for the truth Kaji, that's what you do, that's what you're good at… but what do you expect to happen when you finally get there?"  
"你在挖掘真相，加持，这就是你的本事，你擅长的事……但当你最终抵达那里时，你期望会发生什么？"

Kaji's didn't know what to say.  
加持不知道该说什么。

"You already know what could happen to _you_ when you get there, or but what do you think might happen to Misato?"  
"你已经知道当你到达那里时自己可能遭遇什么，但你觉得对美里来说可能会发生什么？"

"Is that a threat?" Kaji growled, this kid… no he wasn't a kid anymore.  
"那是在威胁吗？" 卡吉咆哮道，这小子……不，他已经不再是孩子了。

"No, it's a reminder that out of everyone, she has the most to lose if you get yourself killed."  
"不，这是在提醒你，如果她失去你，她将失去最多。"

That was a threat. 那确实是个威胁。

"Again, that was a statement, not a threat."  
"再次强调，那是一个声明，不是威胁。"

"I'm trying to help you Kaji, because in the end everything you do and will do doesn't amount to anything, you're wasting your time trying to figure out Human Instrumentality."  
"我试图帮助你，Kaji，因为最终你所做的一切都毫无意义，你试图理解人类补完计划只是在浪费时间。"

Kaji's eyes went wide. Kaji 的眼睛瞪大了。

"What do you know about that?"  
"你对那件事了解多少？"

The boy just curled his lip at him. "That you shouldn't bother with it, instead you should take Misato out on to a nice dinner and tell her how you feel."  
男孩只是对他撇了撇嘴。“你应该别管这事，而是带美里出去吃顿美餐，告诉她你的感受。”

"Why are we talking about my love life now?"  
"为什么我们现在要谈我的感情生活？"

"Because we were talking about mine." He countered.  
"因为我们刚才在谈论我的事。" 他反驳道。

"I can't stay here and water your plants with you Kaji. There's something I have to do, something only I _can_ do."  
"我不能留在这里和你一起浇花，Kaji。有些事情我必须去做，有些事情只有我能做。"

"A long time ago, someone told me that I'd have to make a choice and decide what I wanted to do, and make sure I didn't have regrets afterwards."  
"很久以前，有人告诉我，我必须做出选择，决定自己想做什么，并确保之后不会后悔。"

"So, I'm asking you to trust me, and promise me something."  
"所以，我请求你信任我，并答应我一件事。"

"What exactly would that be?" the man asked.  
"具体是什么事呢？" 那人问道。"

"If something were to happen to me… if something took me from Misato… I think she'd be beyond devastated."  
"如果我发生了什么事……如果我离开了美里……我想她会悲痛欲绝的。"

"Don't go getting yourself killed… be there for her, you can give her something no one else can. You're the only one who can give her a future Kaji, so do that, even if you don't think you're worthy of it, _try_ to be worthy of it."  
"别让自己丢了性命……要陪在她身边，你能给她别人无法给予的东西。你是唯一能给她未来的人，加治，即便你不认为自己配得上，也要努力配得上。"

"Try to be worthy of her."  
"努力配得上她。"

"Remember that the opposite Shore is closer than you think, once you take the first step, you'll never know what you were so scared of."  
"记住，对岸比你想象的更近，一旦迈出第一步，你永远不会知道自己在害怕什么。"

"Say the words you weren't able to eight years ago."  
"说出八年前未能说出口的话。"

Who the hell was this kid?  
这小鬼到底是谁？

The boy turned and started to walk away, with the triple agent too flabbergasted to say anything, to even call out to stop him.  
男孩转身开始走开，三重间谍震惊得说不出话来，甚至无法呼喊阻止他。

The only thing Kaji could decide right there and then was that he had finally come to a conclusion…  
那一刻，加持唯一能确定的是，他终于得出了一个结论……

That Shinji Ikari terrified ever single cell in his body.  
碇真嗣的每一个细胞都充满了恐惧。

**Im pretty sure the Kaji is working with the IPEA in at least some fashion in Rebuild since its implied that he's working with Mari and Mari gets access to Unit-02 for the battle against the 10****th** **Angel, which means that she herself would have to be in some way connected to the IPEA. In NGE we don't get any clarification on who the third entity Kaji is also working for, but it probably has to be either the UN or the JSDF. The UN makes more sense since he's coming from Germany, but it feels to me like it's the JSDF (which would be more meaningful since they attack NERV in EOE), but either way it doesn't really matter here since he's most likely working with the IPEA for reasons stated above.**  
我相当确定在重制版中，加持至少以某种形式与 IPEA 合作，因为暗示了他与真希波合作，而真希波在对抗第 10 使徒的战斗中能够使用零号机，这意味着她本人也必须以某种方式与 IPEA 有关联。在《新世纪福音战士》原作中，我们没有得到任何关于加持还为谁工作的明确信息，但很可能是联合国或日本自卫队。联合国更有道理，因为他来自德国，但在我看来，更像是日本自卫队（这会更有意义，因为他们在《EOE》中攻击了 NERV），但无论如何，在这里并不重要，因为他很可能如上所述为 IPEA 工作。

**I'm not a fan of Shinji being a total dick so we get a passive aggressive tone here. Sometimes a point has to be made, Mari for instance, she is an unknown variable and therefore a threat (much like him to Kaji later in the chapter), but Kaji, well sometimes you just have to hit home the idea that as a triple agent you should be wearing Kevlar…  
我不喜欢真嗣表现得像个十足的混蛋，所以我们在这里采用了一种消极攻击的语气。有时候必须指出一些问题，比如真希波，她是一个未知变量，因此是一个威胁（就像他在《1001》中对加持的威胁一样），但加持，嗯，有时候你得强调一下，作为一个三重间谍，你应该穿上防弹衣……**

**SHOUTOUTS! 特别鸣谢！**

**Akomis – Thanks! You gotta have a little happiness to balance this all out.  
Akomis – 谢谢！你得有一点快乐来平衡这一切。**

**Su Exodus – It's sad really, he can save her from her dreams, but she can't do the same…  
苏逃亡记——真的很悲伤，他能从她的梦境中拯救她，但她却无法同样做到……**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – Ah you noticed the choker didn't you, still debating looking at 3.0+1.0 spoilers.  
美国超旋转者——啊，你注意到那个项圈了吧，还在犹豫是否要看 3.0+1.0 的剧透。**

**EvaPilotFair – We'll see, but Soryu already hates herself so she wouldn't wish for Shiki to be anything like her, though Soryu considers her a fake, we'll have to see.  
伊娃飞行员公平——我们拭目以待，但惣流已经恨透了自己，所以她不会希望式像她一样，尽管惣流认为她是假的，我们还得继续观察。**

**A Guy – Ah very perceptive…  
A Guy – 啊，非常敏锐……**

**MisterHalt – Well speaking of that exact scenario…  
MisterHalt – 嗯，说到那个确切的情景……**

**calborghete - Oh, that particular moment... poor Misato when she realises she did get 'Shinji' killed.  
calborghete - 哦，那个特定时刻……当美里意识到她确实害死了‘真嗣’时，真是可怜她了。  
**

**deathbringer374 – Thanks! Hopefully this keeps you tied over till next week.  
deathbringer374 – 谢谢！希望这能让你撑到下周。**

**Alrighty, no updates this weekend, but expect one by Tuesday.  
好吧，这周末没有更新，但预计周二会有。**

**Until Next Time. 下次再会。**

### Chapter 22: "…Sunset, no regrets…"  
Chapter 22: "…日落，无悔…"

"Rei seems different lately." Misato mused to the blonde next to her.  
"丽最近看起来有些不同。" 美里对身旁的金发女子沉思道。

Cruising in her beloved A310, Misato was sure Ritsuko was happy to be going the speed limit for once. The woman figured that it was the least she could do for her friend after their… heated conversation before the Eighth Angel.  
驾驶着她心爱的 A310，美里确信律子这次能遵守限速一定很高兴。她想，这是她能为朋友做的最起码的事，毕竟在第八使徒来袭前，她们刚刚进行了一场……激烈的对话。

"I've noticed, just the cuts I have to keep bandaging on her fingers is enough to show her commitment to this," the doctor said, flipping over the letter in her hand, 'To Dr. Akaji' written on its front.  
“我注意到了，光是她手指上需要不断包扎的伤口就足以证明她的投入，”医生说着，翻转着手中的信件，信封上写着‘致赤城医生’。

"the idea of her doing something for someone else is starting… I wonder what brought this on."  
“她为别人做些什么的想法开始……我想知道是什么引发了这种转变。”

"Well, it could be love." Misato said with a smirk.  
"嗯，可能是爱情吧。" 美里带着一丝戏谑说道。

"Rei in love? You're joking right?" Ritsuko said incredulously.  
"丽陷入爱河？你在开玩笑吧？" 律子难以置信地说。

Misato just smiled, if this was what she thought it was, Shinji might just be in for something wonderful.  
美里只是微笑着，如果真是她所想的那样，真嗣或许即将迎来一段美妙的经历。

ʡʘʘʢ

Standing over the stovetop, Asuka took a sip of whatever Japanese food she was preparing.  
站在炉子前，Asuka 尝了一口她正在做的日本料理。

"Idiot Shinji would probably like it a little milder, I guess." She muttered as she dumped what little there was left into the sink.  
“笨蛋 Shinji 大概会喜欢淡一点吧，我想。”她喃喃自语，将剩下的少许倒进了水槽。

"I'm home." She heard her guardian called as she heard the door open.  
“我回来了。”她听到她的监护人喊道，同时听到了门打开的声音。

The redhead blinked "Huh, Misato, you're home early."  
红发女孩眨了眨眼，“咦，美里，你今天怎么这么早回来？”

She hadn't expected this, hopefully Misato wouldn't notice the mess she had made of the kitchen.  
她没想到会这样，希望美里不会注意到她把厨房弄得一团糟。

"Yeah, I have to go back to Headquarters, though. I'm just back to take a bath and change my clothes!" she shouted from around the corner.  
“是啊，我还得回总部去。只是回来洗个澡换身衣服！”她从拐角处喊道。

Before Asuka could start hiding what she was dong, the director of operations came around the corner and found herself peering into the kitchen.  
在明日香开始藏起她在做的事情之前，运营总监转过拐角，发现自己正朝厨房里窥视。

"Oh my, what's this?" “哦，天哪，这是什么？”

Asuka just turned slowly to see the woman with a grin on her face.  
明日香只是缓缓转过身，看到那位女士脸上挂着笑容。

"If I had to guess you'd be cooking for Shinji." He said stifling a laugh.  
"如果非要猜的话，你会是为真嗣做饭吧。" 他说着，忍住笑意。

"Wha?!" Asuka leaned forward, childishly trying to cover up the mess that currently was the kitchen.  
"什么？！" 明日香向前倾身，孩子气地试图掩盖厨房里的一片狼藉。

"I'm not, it's for a friend, yeah it's for Hikari!"  
"我不是，这是给朋友的，对，是给光做的！"

"Pfft, what's with both Rei and you getting all romantic all of a sudden?"  
"噗，怎么你和丽突然都这么浪漫起来了？"

"Hey, don't put me together with that pet!" the redhead growled.  
""嘿，别把我跟那宠物混为一谈！"" 红发女孩咆哮道。

"You're right, Rei seems to be taking things to a whole different level."  
"你说得对，丽似乎把事情提升到了一个全新的层次。"

Asuka blinked, "What do you mean?"  
"明日香眨了眨眼，“你什么意思？””

"Well, I get the feeling she's trying to force a bond between Shinji and Commander Ikari."  
“嗯，我感觉她好像在强迫真嗣和碇司令建立某种联系。”

Pulling a letter from her jacket she showed it to the redhead "Here,"  
她从夹克里抽出一封信，递给红发女孩，“给，”

"She's invited everyone to a dinner party and she's going to serve a home cooked meal."  
"她邀请了所有人参加晚宴，并且打算亲自下厨。"

"It's a pretty direct plan, but it might actually work!"  
"计划相当直接，但或许真的能奏效！"

Holding out a letter, Asuka looked down at it.  
明日香拿着一封信，低头看着它。

'To the Pilot of Unit-02'  
'致二号机驾驶员'

Pfft, she couldn't even use her full name.  
噗，她连自己的全名都用不上。

"Bringing those two together is going to be about as easy as moving mountains."  
“让那两人走到一起，简直比移山还难。”

"She's doing all this for Stupid Shinji?" Asuka said, raising an eyebrow.  
"她这么做全是为了那个笨蛋真嗣？" 明日香挑了挑眉。

"It's meant to be a surprise for Shinji, so don't tell him, ok?" the woman pleaded.  
"这是给真嗣的惊喜，所以别告诉他，好吗？" 女人恳求道。

"Oh, like I even care enough!" she growled snatching the letter, muttering 'stupid' under her breath.  
“哼，我根本就不在乎！”她咆哮着夺过信件，低声咒骂着“蠢死了”。

Misato just smirked as she made her way to her room.  
美里只是微微一笑，便朝自己的房间走去。

Scowling, Asuka began to clean up, she didn't want Misato seeing the scale of the mess and she definitely didn't need Shinji seeing it either.  
明日香皱着眉头开始收拾，她不想让美里看到这混乱的规模，更不想让真嗣看到。

With the kitchen cleaned, the Second Child changed into something more comfortbale and pulled out her books. Taking a seat at the kitchen table, she started on her homework and to a lesser extent, work on her kanji as Misato finished and left.  
厨房打扫干净后，二号适格者换上了更舒适的衣物，拿出书本。她在厨房桌旁坐下，开始做作业，顺便也练习了一下汉字，直到美里完成工作离开。

Even after Shinji's help, the redhead still needed to practice, and was sure that the boy could be of assistance clearing up some things.  
即便有了真嗣的帮助，红发女孩仍需多加练习，她确信那男孩能在某些事情上助她一臂之力。

Speaking of the Third Child, he had defiantly taken his time coming back to the apartment, who knew where he and the stooges went after school?  
说到第三适格者，他显然是故意拖延时间才回到公寓的，放学后他和那帮跟班去了哪儿，谁知道呢？

An hour or two later the redhead was resting her head on her left hand and found herself reading the same line of text over and over, doing her best to keep herself from powering up her WonderSwan or looking at the phone in her pocket.  
一两个小时后，红发女孩将头靠在左手上，发现自己一遍遍地读着同一行文字，竭力克制着不去启动她的 WonderSwan 或查看口袋里的手机。

That was until she heard the door opened.  
直到她听到门被打开的声音。

Even when he walked into the kitchen, as much as she wanted to, she didn't look up from the paper she was working on.  
即使他走进厨房，尽管她很想，她也没有从正在处理的文件上抬起头来。

"Finishing some homework?" he asked, dropping his backpack down on the chair beside hers'.  
“在做作业吗？”他问道，将背包扔在她旁边的椅子上。

"I thought that was obvious enough, Stupid Shinji." She muttered.  
“我还以为这够明显了呢，笨蛋真嗣。”她低声嘀咕道。

He said nothing, instead he just walked forward and grabbed her wrist, not hard, but enough for her to stand up in surprise, "C'mon you could use a break.".  
他一言不发，只是走上前抓住她的手腕，力度不大，却足以让她惊起，“来吧，你需要休息一下。”

"Hey!" “嘿！”

Practically dragging her to the door, Asuka scowled at the boy who just looked back at her and smiled.  
几乎是拖着她走向门口，明日香瞪着那个男孩，而他只是回望着她，微笑着。

Heading out the door, he took her to the right and immediately she knew he was taking herto the roof.  
出门后，他带着她向右转，她立刻明白他正领她去屋顶。

Still holding her by her wrist, Shinji stopped short of the same ledge she had found him on a few nights ago and promptly sat down.  
仍然抓着她的手腕，真嗣在那个她曾在几夜前发现他的边缘处停了下来，随即坐下。

Looking up at her, he just motioned for her to sit down next to him.  
他抬头看着她，只是示意她坐在他旁边。

"You know you nearly fell off last time." She grumbled as she took a seat.  
“你知道你上次差点摔下去。”她嘟囔着坐了下来。

"You snuck up on me." He countered.  
“你偷偷摸摸吓到我了。”他反驳道。

The girl rolled her eyes, "Why are we up here?"  
女孩翻了个白眼，“我们为什么上这儿来？”

Shinji just gestured to the distance, she hadn't really taken note of the dimming light, but immediate she knew what he was talking about.  
真嗣只是向远处示意了一下，她并没有真正注意到光线的暗淡，但立刻她就明白了他在说什么。

The sun was just about to dip beyond the horizon, about half of the burning yellow sphere was still visible, though she could still feel a decent bit of warmth on her face. The typically blue sky had shifted colors to the brilliance if a spectrum of reds, oranges, and yellows with only a few light clouds still hovering to break up the picture.  
太阳即将沉入地平线，燃烧的黄色球体还有一半可见，尽管她仍能感受到脸上相当的热度。通常蔚蓝的天空已经转变为一系列红色、橙色和黄色的绚丽色彩，只有几朵轻云依然飘浮，打破了这幅画面。

With Misato's apartment slightly away from the city, Asuka could see the towering retractable skyscrapers reflecting the beautiful light between one another while casting long shadows on the surrounding areas.  
由于美里小姐的公寓离城市稍远，明日香可以看到高耸的可伸缩摩天大楼在彼此之间反射着美丽的光线，同时在周围地区投下长长的阴影。

She wondered why she never thought to sit up here herself, just sitting out on the apartment deck wouldn't have done the scene justice.  
她纳闷自己为何从未想过独自坐在这里，仅仅坐在公寓阳台上，是无法完全领略这番景致的。

"It's great isn't it?" he asked her.  
“真是美妙，不是吗？”他问她。

She gave him no response, just staring at the image before her, trying to drink it in.  
她没有回应，只是凝视着眼前的景象，试图将其深深印入心中。

"Take a picture." “拍张照片。”

"What?" “什么？”

"Your phone, take a picture to keep."  
"用你的手机，拍张照片留念。"

"Why?" "为什么？"

The boy shrugged, "So you never forget the memory, things fade, but you'll have that picture forever."  
男孩耸了耸肩，"这样你就永远不会忘记这段记忆，事物会褪色，但那张照片将永远存在。"

"Here," he said standing up. "let me take it with you in it."  
"来，"他站起身说，"我帮你拍一张你也在里面的。"

Asuka scowled, but she relented, giving the idiot her phone, if this meant getting back to her homework faster so be it.  
明日香皱了皱眉，但还是妥协了，把手机递给了那个笨蛋，如果这样能让她更快回到作业上，那就这样吧。

Taking a few paces back, Shinji held up the flip phone for a picture, a stupid grin on his face.  
退后几步，真嗣举起翻盖手机准备拍照，脸上挂着傻笑。

The Second Child continued to scowl at him and just remained seated with her eyes narrowed, only twisted to look back at him as he walked back to her.  
第二子继续对他皱着眉头，只是坐在那里，眼睛眯起，只有在他走回她身边时才扭头看向他。

Sitting down, she handed her the phone so she could look at it.  
坐下后，她把手机递给她，让她可以看看。

He had captured the radiant colors in the sky and the buildings silhouette by the setting sun, but he had placed plenty of emphasis on her scowling figure too.  
他捕捉到了天空中绚烂的色彩和夕阳下建筑物的剪影，但也着重突出了她皱眉的样子。

Slamming the phone closed she rolled her eyes and just looked back out over the city as a warm breeze blew between them.  
她猛地挂断电话，翻了个白眼，转头望向城市的远方，一阵暖风在他们之间轻轻吹过。

The German looked at the boy next to her out of the corner of her eye, the sun seemed to make his face glow and with that warm smile on his lips he actually seemed like a normal 14-year-old.  
德国女孩用眼角余光打量着身旁的男孩，阳光似乎让他的脸庞熠熠生辉，那温暖的微笑让他看起来真像个普通的 14 岁少年。

But she knew better, she remembered what he had confessed to her, he was very much like her, not quite the same, but close enough that he might just be able to understand her.  
但她深知实情，她记得他向她坦白的一切，他非常像她，虽不完全相同，但足够接近，或许他能真正理解她。

A fellow pilot with no parents in their life, perhaps worse off since he knew his father personally, but the man returned no notion of affection or want to him.  
一个生活中没有父母的飞行员，或许他的处境更糟，因为他曾亲自认识自己的父亲，但那男人对他没有流露出一丝情感或渴望。

However, he had Misato, and the redhead couldn't help but feel jealous at the sight of the woman holding and comforting him that first night after the girl had left him alone or at the hugs the woman gave him when she had a few too many beers.  
然而，他有美里在身边，看到红发女子在那女孩离开后的第一晚抱着他安慰他，或是当她多喝了几杯啤酒时给他拥抱，这让美里不禁感到嫉妒。

A part of her wanted that.  
她内心的一部分渴望那样。

But he wasn't like her, he didn't try to push others away.  
但他不像她，他不会试图推开别人。

He had accepted her, embraced her even, given her warmth when she had come to him the first time, even if she _did_ ultimately leave, but he hadn't held that against her. Even when he had those headphones in and seemed to have the life drained from him, he had still brought her lunch.  
他接受了她，甚至拥抱了她，当她第一次来到他身边时，给了她温暖，即便她最终还是离开了，但他并没有因此记恨。即使他戴着耳机，看起来像是失去了生活的活力，他依然给她带了午餐。

Then there was her… 然后是她……

She hadn't even thanked him; she hadn't done anything for him. Not. One. Thing.  
她甚至没有感谢他；她没有为他做过任何事。一丁点儿都没有。

Hell _Rei_ was doing something for the boy. Whether it was out of kind heartiness or something else the girl didn't quite know yet.  
地狱丽正在为那个男孩做些什么。究竟是出于善良的心意还是其他原因，女孩还不太清楚。

The Second Child however... she even made him promise to stay, even though she hadn't been back to sleep next to him, she had done quite well on her own since then, with no nightmares to speak of, affording her the best string of sleep she had ever known.  
然而，第二适格者……她甚至让他承诺留下，尽管她没有回到他身边睡觉，但从那以后她独自做得相当好，没有噩梦的困扰，让她享受到了前所未有的连续好眠。

Asuka couldn't help but feel guilty, indebted even, all he ever did was do things for her while asking nothing in return, even when he beat her in combat, he hadn't brought it up to rub in her face.  
明日香不禁感到内疚，甚至觉得欠了他什么，他总是为她做事却从不求回报，即使他在战斗中击败了她，也没有提起过这件事来炫耀。

What kind of person did that?  
什么样的人会做出那种事？

Why was he still trying and for seemingly nothing to gain so far? It didn't make any sense to her at all.  
为什么他还在尝试，而且似乎到目前为止没有任何收获？她完全无法理解。

Would he stop? If Rei could give him something would he stop trying to reach out to her and leave her alone, just like before?  
他会停下来吗？如果丽能给他些什么，他会不会停止试图接近她，像以前一样让她独自一人？

Did she still want to be alone?  
她还是想一个人待着吗？

"Do you still want help with you Kanji?" Shinji asked, turning, causing her to blink. The sun had finally retreated completely under the horizon, thought the collage of colors in the sky were still beautiful, it was fading.  
“你还需要我帮你认汉字吗？”真嗣问道，转身时让她眨了眨眼。太阳终于完全沉入了地平线，尽管天空中斑斓的色彩依旧美丽，但也在逐渐消退。

She said nothing and just stood up, turned, and made her way back down to the apartment.  
她一言不发，只是站起身来，转身，径直走回公寓。

A few minutes later the door opened again, and Shinji just sat down next to her around the table.  
几分钟后，门再次打开，真嗣就在桌子旁边坐到了她的旁边。

Pulling his books out of his bag, he eyed her work and opened his own book to her page number.  
他从书包里拿出书本，瞥了一眼她的作业，然后翻开自己的书到她正在看的那一页。

"Roter Drache," he mumbled with a smile.  
“红龙，”他带着微笑喃喃自语。

ʡʘʘʢ

Shinji laid there, his SDAT player next to him unused, staring at the same ceiling all alone like the last few nights.  
真嗣躺在那里，身边的 SDAT 播放器未曾开启，独自凝视着同一片天花板，如同过去几个夜晚一样。

She had come to him, she hadn't just pretended to sleep next to him like Soryu had originally done, he had asked to sleep next to him. She had pleaded, even if she had called him 'Stupid Shinji'.  
她主动来到他身边，不像丽最初那样只是假装睡在他旁边，是他请求她陪睡的。她甚至恳求过，尽管她曾称他为‘笨蛋真嗣’。

Even if she wanted distance, to keep that sense of independence that he knew she craved just like the first time, he didn't want her to run away, he would make sure that she wouldn't push him away.  
即使她想要保持距离，维持那份他知道她第一次时就渴望的独立感，他也不希望她逃离，他会确保她不会推开他。

He looked over at the empty space next to him, his hand fiddling with the cross pendent around his neck, he was sure to leave it open for her, just in-case she came through his door.  
他瞥了一眼身旁的空位，手指摆弄着脖子上的十字吊坠，他特意留着这个位置给她，以防她突然推门而入。

"_Another cold night for you then hmm."_ _Soryu mumbled, standing there just peering out the window._  
“看来你又要过一个寒冷的夜晚了，嗯？”Soryu 喃喃自语，站在那里只是凝视着窗外。

No sooner than the words left her mouth, the door slid open, and soon a familiar weight found itself laying next to him.  
她的话音刚落，门便滑开了，很快一个熟悉的重量躺在了他的身旁。

Looking over, Asuka was on her right side just like the last two times, her back to him.  
望过去，明日香正侧躺着，和前两次一样背对着他。

He rolled over and put his arm over her waist, only this time moving just that bit closer to her back, but not quite resting up against it.  
他翻身过来，手臂搭在她的腰间，只是这次稍稍向她的背部挪近了些，却并未完全贴靠上去。

"The nightmares came back." She said softly, it sounded to him like she was trying to excuse her behavior, to herself at least.  
"噩梦又回来了。" 她轻声说道，听起来像是在为自己的行为辩解，至少是对自己。

He understood that behavior all too well.  
他非常理解这种行为。

"It's ok," He whispered reassuringly, "you can always come here."  
"没关系，" 他轻声安慰道，"你随时可以来这里。"

"I made a promise, didn't I?"  
"我许下了承诺，不是吗？"

She said nothing, instead she just brought her left hand up to grab his wrist.  
她一言未发，只是将左手抬起，抓住了他的手腕。

The Third Children smiled softly to himself, perhaps she could find a small measure of peace, even for a little while.  
第三适格者微微一笑，或许她能找到一丝安宁，哪怕只是短暂的片刻。

"_Smile all you want Third," the redhead grumbled from the window "you'll just find a way to mess all this up somehow."_  
“尽管笑吧，第三适格者，”红发少女从窗边咕哝道，“你总会以某种方式搞砸这一切。”

He ignored the specter, and just stared at the mess of red hair in front of him, enjoying the warmth from her body as her breathing rose and lowered his arm around her.  
他无视了那幽灵，只是凝视着眼前那一团乱糟糟的红发，享受着她身体散发出的温暖，随着她的呼吸起伏，他的手臂环绕着她。

He wouldn't get a minute of sleep tonight, which was ok if it meant he wouldn't risk disturbing her with his dreams. He could do that for her, anything for her…  
他今晚恐怕一分钟也睡不着，但只要这意味着不会因他的梦境而打扰到她，那就没关系。他愿意为她这么做，为她做任何事……

He owed her more than a dreamless night.  
他欠她的远不止一个无梦的夜晚。

**I like how for the Rebuilds it's still 2015 and they have don't have smartphones like we had in 2015, even if 2.0 came out in 2009 you don't see people with a lot of advanced technology. It makes sense since the 2****nd** **Impact probably would have redirected pretty much every industry towards dealing with the fallout instead of consumer goods. So NERV can have advanced technology but normal people don't feel the effects in their daily lives nearly as much as they would have. Or maybe I'm full of crap haha.  
我喜欢《新世纪福音战士》重制版中，尽管故事背景设定在 2015 年，角色们却没有智能手机，就像我们 2015 年所拥有的那样，即便 2.0 版本在 2009 年就已推出，你也不会看到人们拥有大量先进科技。这很合理，因为第二次冲击可能已经将几乎所有行业转向处理灾难后果，而非消费产品。因此，NERV 可以拥有先进技术，但普通人在日常生活中几乎感受不到这些影响。或者，也许我完全是在胡说八道，哈哈。**

**SHOUTOUTS! (wow, lots this time)  
特别鸣谢！（这次真的很多）**

**Greg242 – I mean I think we all enjoy it when he has a backbone, but its not who he is.  
Greg242 – 我的意思是，我们都喜欢他展现出骨气的时候，但这并不是他的全部。**

**EvaPilotFair – Thanks!  EvaPilotFair – 感谢！**

**Akomis – Mari's going to be interesting since we know so little that she's basically a blank slate for the story haha.  
Akomis – 玛丽会很有趣，因为我们对她知之甚少，她基本上是故事中的一张白纸，哈哈。**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – Glad you're liking it. I'd say this is really just a continuation of the fieldtrip's conversation, at least that's what I tried to do.  
Da USA 的超斯宾克 – 很高兴你喜欢。我想这实际上只是实地考察时对话的延续，至少我是这么尝试的。**

**AK-103 – Oh there's plenty of better stories out there, but I'm glad you're enjoying it!  
AK-103 – 哦，外面还有许多更精彩的故事，但我很高兴你喜欢这个！**

**Su Exodus – If it were almost anyone else, they wouldn't know what the heck you just wrote haha, choo choo!  
Su Exodus – 如果是其他人，他们可能根本不知道你刚才写了什么，哈哈，嘟嘟火车！**

**Duckz – Thank you! I don't intend to!  
Duckz – 谢谢！我可没打算！**

**Soryu-asuka-langley – Shhh! That's the title for a future chapter! At least someone's getting the songs. IDK maybe, I'm not sure Kaji's would be blabbing his mouth to everyone, even Gendo, but to Misato…?  
Soryu-asuka-langley – 嘘！那是未来某篇chapter的标题！至少有人听懂了这些歌。我不确定，也许，我不敢肯定加持会不会到处乱说，哪怕是给碇源堂，但如果是美里呢…？**

**Gleaming Onyx – "I may have gone to far in a few places…" yeah, it's a thin line between being a bit dark and going to straight edge. But I do want to point out it was meant to be an OOC moment for our Shinji, kinda, he's not like that to be cool, he wants to scare Mari (since he doesn't know who she is) and Kaji (into action), I'll try to keep from going straight edge.  
闪耀黑曜石——“我可能在某些地方走得太远了……”是的，在略显暗黑与过于极端之间，界限确实很微妙。不过我想指出，这对我们的真嗣来说，算是一个 OOC 时刻，有点儿，他并非为了耍酷，而是想吓唬玛丽（因为他不知道她是谁）和加持（以促使他行动），我会尽量避免走向极端。**

**Why!- Thank you for pointing that out, can't believe I got this far with realizing it/someone pointing it out! It should be fixed now, IDK why I kept spelling that way, I had it Toji in my notes, but regardless, it should all be fixed now. Let me know about anything else!  
为什么！——感谢你指出这一点，真不敢相信我竟然一直没意识到/有人指出这个问题！现在应该已经修正了，不知道为什么我一直那样拼写，我的笔记里明明是“Toji”，但不管怎样，现在应该都改过来了。如果有其他问题请告诉我！**

**skyf0x – Yeah, if I do I will defiantly be putting a warning in the summary and above those chapters! But I'd like to get some canon answers to things even if I've unintentionally paved over them. Hope you enjoy the rest of the story!  
skyf0x – 是的，如果我这么做了，我肯定会在这几章的摘要和上方加上警告！但我还是希望能得到一些原作的答案，即使我不小心掩盖了它们。希望你喜欢故事的其余部分！**

**Comedy Guy – Thanks! I wanted a reversal of the scene we got in 2.0, which I think fits really well haha.  
喜剧侠 – 谢谢！我想要反转我们在 2.0 中看到的场景，我觉得这样很合适，哈哈。**

**calborghete – I'm kinda indifferent to her as a character simply because she's kinda a null variable, she doesn't contribute to the story very much (apart from fighting Zerual, which means I can tweak the character without guilt (almost like a canon OC, even though I don't do those).  
calborghete – 我对她这个角色有点无所谓，因为她基本上是个零变量，对故事贡献不大（除了与 Zerual 战斗之外，这意味着我可以随意调整这个角色而不会感到内疚（有点像官方原创角色，尽管我不做那些）。**

**Alright it's a bit shorter this week but, I'll post this weekend hopefully, classes are getting hectic so expect Wednesdays and one other chapter on the weekends.  
好吧，这周的内容稍短一些，但希望能在周末发布，课程越来越紧张，预计周三和周末再更新一篇chapter。**

**Until Next Time 下次再见**

### Chapter 23: "…we'll know better when we're older…"  
Chapter 23: "…等我们长大些，就会更明白了…"

Kaji sat on the outdoor patio dinner area enjoying the permanent summer breeze.  
卡吉坐在户外用餐区的露台上，享受着永恒的夏日微风。

The small restaurant he had found was perfect for him, small, secluded, and just the right distance outside of Tokyo-3.  
他找到的这家小餐馆对他来说再合适不过了，小巧、隐蔽，恰到好处地位于第三新东京市郊。

The fact they also had amazing pie was an added bonus, a bonus that he was happily exploiting right now while he sat there waiting. He had bought a second for the person he was meeting, which he hoped wasn't ruined from her tardiness.  
他们家的美味派更是一大加分项，他此刻正乐此不疲地享受着。他给即将见面的人也买了一份，只希望她的迟到不会让这份派变凉。

Taking another bite, he leaned on the table and looked out at the city, it was almost noon and everyone was rushing to get lunch, causing massive amounts of traffic.  
他又咬了一口，靠在桌上望向城市，快到正午时分，人们都在赶着去吃午饭，造成了严重的交通拥堵。

Maybe that's why she was late, he looked down at his watch, 20 minutes late to be precise.  
或许这就是她迟到的原因，他低头看了看手表，确切地说，晚了 20 分钟。

But he wasn't overly bothered by it, not with the view and the food, though the thought of it being a sign was in the back of his head.  
但他对此并不太在意，有这景色和美食在，尽管他脑海里隐约觉得这可能是个征兆。

The man took solus in the fact that he had been able to source some Kevlar, even if said material really did weight him down.  
这个男人庆幸自己能弄到一些凯夫拉纤维，尽管这种材料确实让他感到沉重。

He figured while he waited, he could find a worse time for his mind to dwell on the words of a certain 14-year-old.  
他想，既然要等，不如找个更糟糕的时间来琢磨某个 14 岁孩子的话。

"_You know… when you're with Misato, those quiet moments together… and you talk about your brother…"_  
"你知道……当你和美里在一起时，那些安静的时刻……你们谈论你的哥哥……"

"_I know lots of things."_  
"我知道很多事情。"

"…_you're wasting your time trying to figure out Human Instrumentality."_  
“……你试图理解人类补完计划只是在浪费时间。”

His mind had been distracted by those words for the past few days. Who was the kid working for? Gendo? Perhaps that cold exterior was an act, as hard as that might seem. SEELE? Maybe as revenge against his own father, that could be intriguing.  
过去几天里，他的思绪一直被这些话所困扰。那孩子是为谁工作的？碇源堂？或许那冷漠的外表只是一种伪装，尽管这听起来难以置信。SEELE？或许是出于对他自己父亲的报复，那倒是挺有意思的。

Either way he wasn't on his side, that was something he was certain of, he made sure to check and double check with his superiors. The kid wasn't working for them.  
无论如何，他不在自己这一边，这一点他确信无疑，他确保向他的上级反复核实。那孩子并不为他们工作。

And this was at the worst possible time too, after what happened in the United States.  
而且这恰恰发生在最糟糕的时刻，就在美国发生那件事之后。

Now that Unit-04 was destroyed and the Americans were shipping Unit-03 over to be tested here, Kaji had to redirect his efforts towards whatever information NERV had on the event in the US.  
既然 04 号机已被摧毁，美国人又将 03 号机运来此地进行测试，加持不得不将精力转向 NERV 所掌握的关于美国事件的任何信息。

Taking another bite of his pie Kaji thought drifted to what he knew of the Human Instrumentality Project, or perhaps to what little he did know.  
又咬了一口派，加持的思绪飘向了他所了解的人类补完计划，或者说，他那少得可怜的了解。

Essentially the name was all he really knew, and the fact it had to do with the Evangelions.  
实际上，他真正知道的只有这个名字，以及它与 EVA 有关。

The IPEA was going to be taking one of the Units into custody in two days, at least if Unit-03's handling doesn't fall behind by then.  
IPEA 将在两天后接管其中一台 EVA，至少如果三号机的处理进度不落后的话。

The limitations of the Vatican treaty puzzled him, why make it so only 3 could be active at a time? What was the point? To keep one country from possessing the world's more than 3 of the most powerful weapon ever created?  
梵蒂冈条约的限制让他困惑不已，为何规定同时只能有三个处于激活状态？这有何意义？是为了防止某个国家拥有超过三件史上最强大的武器，从而掌控世界吗？

But NERV was an independent organization to the Japanese government…  
但 NERV 是独立于日本政府之外的组织……

Suddenly someone sitting down across from him brought him from his thoughts.  
突然，有人在他对面坐下，将他从沉思中拉回现实。

"You should really be more aware." The brunette said pushing up her glasses.  
"你真该更警觉些。" 棕发女孩推了推她的眼镜说道。

"Well, when someone is 25 minutes late, its hard to pay attention." He said, taking another bite from his pie.  
"好吧，当某人迟到 25 分钟时，很难集中注意力。" 他说着，又咬了一口派。

"It's not my fault! You were the one who wanted to meet at noon when everyone else wants to get something to eat!"  
"这可不是我的错！是你非要中午见面，那时候大家都想吃点东西！"

Kaji said nothing and just leaned down to the bag next to his chair. Pulling out an envelope, the man handed it to the Brit, who opened it and inspected the contents inside.  
加治一言不发，只是弯腰从椅子旁的包里拿出一个信封。他将信封递给那位英国人，后者打开并检查了里面的内容。

"That's all your documents, passport, birth certificate, you name it."  
“这些都是你的文件，护照、出生证明，应有尽有。”

Closing the envelope, Mari placed it on the table "Thanks, I've been wanting to get out of that safehouse, honestly it's worse then where you had me at Bethany Base."  
玛丽合上信封，将其放在桌上，“谢谢，说实话，我一直想离开那个安全屋，那里比贝瑟尼基地的条件还要糟糕。”

The man just shrugged "Take it up with someone else, it's not my responsibility."  
那人只是耸了耸肩，“去找别人说吧，这不是我的责任。”

Leaning forwards onto the table, the man eyed the girl, she was a little young to be working for the IPEA, but at least she was 2 years older than the other pilots.  
男人向前倾身靠在桌上，打量着女孩，她年纪轻轻就为 IPEA 工作，但至少比其他驾驶员大两岁。

That was still too young to be in this line of business.  
即便如此，在这个行业里还是太年轻了。

"Your assignment is to be on standby for whatever Evangelion Unit that's going to be put in storage."  
“你的任务是随时待命，负责即将被封存的任何 EVA 单位。”

The girl frowned, "I was told I wouldn't just be sitting around again."  
女孩皱起眉头，“我被告知这次不会只是闲坐着。”

"Things change, with Unit-03 coming we need an independent pilot just as a precaution."  
“事情总在变，随着三号机到来，我们需要一个独立的驾驶员以防万一。”

Sighing the teen crossed her arms, "Fine, just don't expect me to be cheery with the other pilots if I have to bail them out."  
少女叹了口气，双臂交叉，“好吧，别指望我会在不得不救他们时还对其他驾驶员笑脸相迎。”

Kaji raised an eyebrow "What's that supposed to mean?"  
加持挑了挑眉，“你这是什么意思？”

"Well, you've heard the rumors about the Third Children, right?"  
“嗯，你听说过关于第三适格者的那些传闻吧？”

Narrowing his eyes Kaji's interest was peaked "The whole resurrection business?"  
加持眯起眼睛，兴趣被勾起，“那个复活的事？”

"Yeah, but I kinda um… landed on him…"  
"是啊，但我有点呃……落在他身上了……"

Kaji closed his eyes and took a deep breath "You what?"  
加治闭上眼睛，深吸了一口气：“你说什么？”

"When I came into Japan and the wind took me off course?" she rubbed the back of her head sheepishly.  
"当我进入日本境内，风把我吹偏了方向的时候？" 她不好意思地挠了挠后脑勺。

"Of all the places to land…"  
"偏偏落在了这个地方……"

Kaji's hands just rubbed his face, great, her cover was compromised.  
加治的手正揉着脸，糟了，她的伪装暴露了。

"I mean, he was kind of a jerk, but I'm sure…"  
"我是说，他虽然有点讨厌，但我相信……"

"What do you mean?" Kaji asked, interrupting the girl.  
"你什么意思？" 加治打断了女孩的话。

"Well…" she frowned "he kinda, threatened me?"  
"嗯……" 她皱起眉头 "他有点，威胁我？"

Kaji just cocked his head, did the girl just say Shinji Ikari threatened her?  
加治只是歪了歪头，这女孩刚才是说碇真嗣威胁了她吗？

"What exactly did he say?"  
"他到底说了什么？"

"Well, he might have mentioned popping my head off like a cork if I threatened his friends."  
"嗯，他可能提到了如果我威胁他的朋友，就会像拔瓶塞一样把我的头拧下来。"

"Or at least that was the gist of it." She explained.  
"或者至少大意是这样的。" 她解释道。"

Kaji sat back in his chair, "Well that coupled with what he told me…"  
加治靠回椅背，“好吧，再加上他告诉我的那些……”

"Is there something I need to know?" Mari asked the man.  
“有什么我需要知道的吗？”玛丽问那人。

"Just stay away from the boy if you can," Kaji explained "he… is an unknown variable." How diplomatic. The kid was looking more and more like a danger every time he was brought up.  
“如果可以的话，离那孩子远点，”加治解释道，“他……是个未知数。”这话多委婉。每次提到这孩子，他看起来越来越像个危险人物。

Standing from the table Kaji looked down on the girl, who defiantly looked too young for this.  
站在桌旁，Kaji 俯视着那个女孩，她看起来倔强得过于年轻，不适合这里。

"I already paid for your piece, so don't worry about it."  
“我已经付了你的那份，所以不用担心。”

"Alrighty." The teen smiled with delight, taking her first bite of her pie with a smile.  
“好的。”少女开心地笑了，带着微笑咬下了她的第一口派。

"Make sure to keep a low profile till you get activated, alright?"  
"确保在你被激活之前保持低调，好吗？"

She just gave the man a thumbs up as she chewed.  
她只是边嚼边向那人竖了个大拇指。

Turning to leave, Kaji only took a step before turning back "One more thing."  
转身离开时，加持只迈了一步就又转回来，“还有一件事。”

Mari raised an eyebrow at the statement, what else?  
玛丽对这个说法挑了挑眉，还能有什么？

"They got a new plug suit for you, a real one this time, should do better than that junk you had to wear at Bethany."  
“他们给你弄了套新的插件服，这次是真货，应该比你在贝瑟尼穿的那堆破烂强多了。”

The girl smiled as she swallowed "Well, they better have gotten it right!"  
女孩笑着咽了咽口水，“好吧，他们最好没搞砸！”

Kaji shrugged as he turned for the last time to leave, things were going get interesting indeed.  
碇司耸了耸肩，最后一次转身离开，事情确实变得有趣起来了。

ʡʘʘʢ

The two of them sat there, at the edge of their usual basketball court, both eating the last melting bits of their popsicles.  
两人坐在他们常去的篮球场边，各自吃着快要融化的最后一口冰棍。

Kensuke laid back, the last of his snack discarded. Resting his hands behind his head, he just stared up at the sky.  
健介向后一躺，最后一口零食已经丢弃。他将双手枕在脑后，只是凝视着天空。

_She was standing across the court from them, just resting against the chain-link fence, arms crossed glaring at the two. Shinji was certain he could hear the word 'stooges' mumbled a few times.  
她站在球场对面，只是靠在铁丝网围栏上，双臂交叉，瞪着他们俩。真嗣确信自己几次听到她低声咕哝着‘小丑’这个词。_

Shinji was working on the last of his. The idea behind Toji's absence was starting to bother him, and he was dreading what was coming.  
真嗣正在吃最后一根冰棒。想到明日香不在的原因，他开始感到不安，对即将发生的事情感到恐惧。

"Hey Ikari," “嘿，碇。”

"hmm?" he was still eating the last of his popsicle  
“嗯？”他还在吃最后一根冰棒

"I heard they're shipping Unit-03 to Japan" Kensuke mused.  
"我听说他们要把 03 号机运往日本。" 真希波若有所思地说道。

The Third Children just swallowed the last of his frozen snack silently, it was just as he thought. Ireul, Leliel… it wasn't like he expected things to be the same, after all they could come at anytime afterwards, but it would have been nice to have more time.  
第三适格者默默地吃完了最后一口冰冻零食，正如他所想。伊留尔，雷利尔……他并不指望一切能和以前一样，毕竟他们随时可能再次来袭，但能多些时间总是好的。

Regaining his composure, the boy just turned to his friend, "They are? that's the first time I've heard of it" he lied.  
男孩恢复了镇定，转向他的朋友，"他们要运走？这是我第一次听说" 他撒了个谎。

"There are rumors that the US is forcing Japan to perform the activation experiments." He explained, still laying on his back, looking at the sky.  
"有传言说美国正在逼迫日本进行激活实验。" 他解释道，依旧仰面躺着，望着天空。

"Well it's not information that you pilots would need, but man I wonder who will pilot it?"  
"好吧，这不是你们飞行员需要的信息，但我真好奇谁会来驾驶它？"

_Our friend. 我们的朋友。_

He had thought about warning Misato about Bardiel. He was over the fear of her being privy to NERV's true goal, after seeing her guilt over him and how she was pretty much the same as his first life, he had put that fear aside, but it wasn't worth derailing how far he'd come.  
他曾考虑过警告美里关于巴迪尔的事。在看到她对他的愧疚以及她几乎与前世无异的表现后，他已不再担心她知晓 NERV 的真实目的，但这样做不值得打乱他迄今为止所取得的进展。

He could save Toji, he had ripped out the Fourth Children's entry plug how many times before? Even in this slightly different life he had been able to cut out Unit-01's entry plug after the Sixth Angel. He was sure he'd succeed.  
他可以救出东治，他之前已经多少次拔出第四适格者的插入栓了？即便在这个稍有不同的生活中，他在第六使徒事件后也能成功切出 01 号机的插入栓。他确信自己会成功。

He could save Toji Suzuhara.  
他可以救出铃原东治。

"I don't know, I never heard anything." Shinji said quietly.  
"我不知道，我从没听说过这种事。" 真嗣轻声说道。

"It must be so cool to be a pilot! You'd think they ever pick me?"  
"成为一名驾驶员一定很酷吧！你觉得他们会选我吗？"

Shinji just looked down at the boy whose head was in the clouds. Suddenly he was back in that tall grass, having run away again.  
真嗣低头看着那个满脑子幻想的男孩。突然间，他又回到了那片高高的草丛中，又一次选择了逃离。

_He was sitting around a campfire, a camo jacket draped over his shoulders.  
他坐在篝火旁，一件迷彩夹克披在肩上。_

"_I wouldn't if I were you. Your mother would be worried sick."_  
“如果我是你，我不会这么做。你妈妈会担心得要命。”

"_Well, that's not a problem, I don't have one."_  
“哦，那不是问题，我没有妈妈。”

"_I'm like you Shinji."_ “我和你一样，真嗣。”

Maybe the boy he was looking at had a mother, maybe his class wasn't made up of children from broken families, candidates for Evangelions… but he doubted it.  
或许他注视的那个男孩有母亲，或许他的班级并非由破碎家庭的孩子组成，不是初号机的候选者……但他对此表示怀疑。

The kid didn't know what he was asking for, what kind of trade he would be giving to pilot an EVA.  
那孩子不知道自己在要求什么，驾驶 EVA 会付出怎样的代价。

"I pray they don't," Shinji said quietly "I don't want you to end up like me."  
“我希望他们不会，”真嗣轻声说道，“我不想你变得像我一样。”

The boy raised an eyebrow at that statement, "What's that supposed to mean Shinji?"  
男孩对此话挑了挑眉，“那是什么意思，真嗣？”

"You're one of the bravest people I know, you lost your memory and you still got back in Unit-01 to save us all!"  
“你是我认识的最勇敢的人之一，你失去了记忆，却依然回到零号机里来救我们大家！”

_Shinji said nothing, instead he just looked at the redhead across the court, who glared back at him.  
真嗣一言不发，只是看着球场对面那位红发少年，对方也瞪着他。_

"Hey your plan even worked!" Kensuke said sitting up.  
“嘿，你的计划居然奏效了！” 健介坐起身来说道。

"What do you mean?" “你什么意思？”

"Where do you think Toji's at right now?" the militaria nerd said with a smile.  
"你觉得现在 Toji 在哪儿？" 军事迷笑着说。

Shinji shrugged. 真嗣耸了耸肩。

"He's currently taking Hikari out to dinner, and you're the one who made it happen!"  
"他正带 Hikari 出去吃饭呢，这可是你促成的！"

Shinji's eyes widened; he hadn't expected that to be so easy.  
真嗣的眼睛睁大了；他没想到会这么容易。

"Really? One fieldtrip and they're already dating?" he asked puzzled.  
“真的吗？一次实地考察旅行他们就在一起了？”他困惑地问道。

Kensuke smirked, "They must have been doing something for a while because I caught them tearing each other's faces off behind the school the other day."  
“他们肯定已经有一段时间了，因为我前几天看到他们在学校后面互相撕扯对方的脸。”健介得意地笑着说。

Shinji smiled at that, Toji could have that happiness for himself. It just gave him more reason to save him from Unit-03.  
听到这话，真嗣笑了，东治本可以拥有那份幸福的。这更让他有了拯救他从三号机中脱险的理由。

It also meant he could ruin Toji's world even more.  
这也意味着他能让东治的世界更加崩坏。

"I thought they'd at least wait to get together until the Spring Dance." Shinji mused.  
“我以为他们至少会等到春日舞会才在一起。”真嗣沉思道。

"Oh, I'm willing to bet that's what set this all off." His friend replied.  
"哦，我敢打赌这就是这一切的导火索。" 他的朋友回答道。

.

.

.

"So, did you get to asking Asuka yet?"  
"那么，你问过明日香了吗？"

"No… I" Shinji froze, realizing what he just said.  
"没有……我" 真嗣僵住了，意识到自己刚刚说了什么。

Ah, shit. 啊，该死。

"YOU LUCKY BASTARD!" in an instant he was being tackled by the nerd, who was doing his best to wrap him in a hug.  
"你这幸运的家伙！" 转眼间，他被那个书呆子扑倒，对方正竭尽全力用拥抱困住他。

"I knew there was something there!" he shouted, realizing that he couldn't tackle the boy while seated, he sprang up off the concrete and looked at him.  
"我就知道有戏！" 他喊道，意识到坐着无法扑倒那男孩，他猛地从水泥地上弹起，盯着他看。

"So, you two…" "那么，你们俩……"

"No, it's not like that!" Shinji interrupted "I don't… I can't just jump right in, I… look I am going to ask her, it's just not the right time."  
"不，不是那样的！" 真嗣打断道，"我……我不能就这么贸然行动，我……听着，我会去问她的，只是现在时机不对。"

"But you two?" Kensuke said, imply the two were a couple.  
"但你们俩呢？" 健介说，暗示两人是一对情侣。

"It's complicated." "情况很复杂。"

"Friends with benefits?" the boy asked with a perverted smile.  
"炮友关系？" 男孩带着猥琐的笑容问道。"

_He was sure Soryu was mumbling something about 'baka hentai' back on the fence.  
他确信索鲁在栅栏那边咕哝着什么“笨蛋变态”之类的话。_

"NO!" Shinji shouted, his face going red "Listen, even I don't know, but we're… close alright."  
“不！” 真嗣喊道，脸涨得通红，“听着，我也不知道，但我们……关系很好，行了吧。”

Even he wasn't really sure if they were 'close', but she trusted him enough to sleep next to him, so he really didn't know what else to call it. She had confessed things to him sure, but she wasn't exactly acting happy when she laid down next to him to sleep. She was different than any other Asuka he had met before.  
他甚至不确定他们是否真的“亲密”，但她信任他到可以睡在他身边，所以他真的不知道还能怎么形容。她确实向他坦白了心事，但当她躺下睡在他旁边时，她并没有表现出快乐的样子。她与之前他遇到的任何明日香都不同。

And he was fine with that, as long as it helped her, he just wanted her to be happy.  
而他对此没意见，只要这能帮到她，他只希望她能快乐。

"Just… sit down." Shinji said, gesturing to the concrete slab next to him.  
“就……坐下吧。”真嗣说道，示意旁边的水泥板。

Kensuke obliged, the smirk still on his face.  
健介顺从地坐下，脸上仍挂着那抹得意的笑。

Perhaps now it was the best time to ask this. After all, with Bardiel coming… if he had to disobey orders to save Toji… he had been in serious trouble before and he didn't want to chance anything.  
也许现在是问这个问题的最佳时机。毕竟，随着巴迪尔的到来……如果他为了救东治不得不违抗命令……他之前已经陷入过严重的麻烦，他不想再冒险了。

"Because you're my friend… and I let that slip." The Third Children said quietly.  
"因为你是我朋友……而我让那事泄露了。" 第三适格者轻声说道。

"Promise me something…" "答应我一件事……"

The boy's face lit up in a bit of excitement and confusion.  
男孩的脸上闪过一丝兴奋与困惑交织的神情。

"I think… something will happen… eventually…"  
"我觉得…总有一天…会有事情发生的…"

"Where's this coming from Shinji?" He asked confused, "We're talking about your girl here, don't change the subject."  
"这从何说起，真嗣？" 他困惑地问，"我们在谈你的女孩呢，别转移话题。"

He shook his head "Just listen to me."  
他摇了摇头，"听我说就好。"

"If something happens… to me…"  
"如果有什么事……发生在我身上……"

"Hey don't talk like that!"  
"嘿，别这么说！"

Shinji just frowned "Just 'cause I say something might happen doesn't mean it will…"  
真嗣只是皱了皱眉，“我只是说可能发生，并不意味着一定会……”

"It's just like with the military, they have contingencies, don't they?"  
"这就像军队一样，他们有应急计划，不是吗？"

The nerd rubbed the back of his head "I mean yeah, but…"  
那个书呆子揉了揉后脑勺，"我的意思是没错，但是……"

"Then just listen." "那就听我说。"

"If anything happens to me…"  
"如果我有什么不测……"

"I want you to promise me you'll look after Toji, he'll be my replacement."  
"我要你答应我，照顾好 Toji，他会接替我的位置。"

"Really? Did NERV tell you he's gonna be picked?"  
"真的吗？NERV 告诉你他会入选吗？"

"No, but I know…" "不，但我知道……"

"and I want you to promise me something else."  
"我还有件事要你答应我。"

"Asuka…" "明日香……"

"Don't let her retreat into herself, don't let her be consumed by..."  
"别让她退缩，别让她被吞噬……"

"Dude are you telling me to date your girlfriend if you die?" He asked eyebrow raised.  
"伙计，你是说如果你死了，让我和你女朋友约会？" 他挑眉问道。

"NO OF COURSE IM NOT!"  
"当然不是！"

He took a breath "I'm saying that if something happens, make sure she takes care of herself, because I'm afraid… I _know_ she'll…." He stopped, not wanting to think what might happen.  
他深吸一口气，“我是说，如果有什么事发生，确保她能照顾好自己，因为我担心……我知道她会……”他顿住了，不愿去想可能发生的事情。

"Wow that serious between you two? Hmmm"  
“哇，你们俩之间这么严重吗？嗯……”

"Kensuke stop dammit!" “健介，住手，该死的！”

The boy blinked at how different the once timid boy was.  
男孩眨了眨眼，惊讶于曾经胆怯的男孩如今变得如此不同。

"You're really serious, aren't you?" he said softly, realizing what his friend was asking of him.  
“你真的认真了，对吧？”他轻声说道，意识到朋友在向他请求什么。

"If I can't be there for Asuka, or Toji and Hikari, I need you to make sure they…" he stopped himself before he said anything too drastic.  
“如果我不能陪在明日香、或是真治和光身边，我需要你确保他们……”他及时打住，没说出什么过激的话。

"I don't think anything will come of it, even if I have to go against orders and kicked out of NERV or thrown in a cell, or something worse happens…"  
"即便我违抗命令被逐出 NERV，或是被关进牢房，甚至发生更糟糕的事情……我也觉得这一切不会有任何结果。"

"I'm not worried about Toji at least not as much now… he has Hikari."  
"至少我现在不太担心真治……他有光。"

"Asuka… I don't know, she'll just push everyone away again and I'm afraid she could do something worse to herself."  
"明日香……我不知道，她可能会再次推开所有人，我担心她会对自己做出更糟糕的事情。"

The boy just nodded to the Third Children. "Alright."  
男孩只是对第三适格者点了点头。“好的。”

Shinji looked at the boy, who pushed up his glasses.  
真嗣看着那个男孩，他推了推眼镜。

"I promise I'll make sure she's alright."  
“我保证我会确保她没事。”

Shinji nodded "Thank you, I know that's…. a lot to ask."  
真嗣点点头，“谢谢你，我知道这……要求很多。”

They sat there for a moment, both boys just letting the warm breeze pass between them.  
他们坐在那里片刻，两个男孩任由温暖的微风在他们之间穿梭。

"So can I date your girl if you die?" Kensuke asked with a smug smile on his face.  
"那如果我死了，我能和你女朋友约会吗？" 真希问，脸上带着得意的笑容。

Shinji looked at him "Absolutely fucking not." He said before slight grin appeared on his face.  
真嗣看着他，"绝对不行。"他说完，脸上露出一丝微笑。

"You couldn't handle her anyways."  
"反正你也驾驭不了她。"

**Yeah, instead of having Mari just looking at birds maybe we could have gotten something about her or what she does instead, just saying.  
是啊，与其让玛丽只是看鸟，也许我们可以更深入地展现她的个性或她做的事情，只是提个建议。**

**SHOUTOUTS! 特别鸣谢！**

**Su Exodus – I think this is more a rollercoaster ride than a train honestly haha!  
Su Exodus – 说实话，我觉得这更像是一场过山车之旅，而不是火车旅行，哈哈！**

**UntraSpink of Da USA – I guess that's true, I mean I think I'd be a lot like how WW2 mobilized entire economies, car companies wouldn't be making cars, instead they'd be producing whatever the government told them was needed so that the world could get back on it's feet. But yeah it would have wiped out plenty of people who created more advanced tech for the masses.  
UntraSpink of Da USA – 我想确实如此，我的意思是，我觉得这会像二战那样动员整个经济体系，汽车公司不再生产汽车，而是按照政府的指示生产所需物品，以便世界能够重新站起来。不过，这也确实会让许多为大众创造先进技术的人消失。**

**K4153r – Thanks! I think that's why we feel for Shinji so much, the kid can't get a break.  
K4153r – 谢谢！我想这就是我们如此同情真嗣的原因，这孩子真是没一刻能喘口气。**

**EvaPilotFair – Thanks! I mean she mumbles that Shinji wouldn't like the taste so she has to be making it for Shinji, she probably stopped when she learned Rei was doing a dinner party, judging by the differing number of bandages they both have.  
EvaPilotFair – 谢谢！我是说她咕哝着说真嗣不会喜欢这味道，所以她肯定是在为真嗣做这个，她可能是在得知绫波要办晚宴后停手的，从他们俩身上绷带的数量不同就能看出来。**

**skyf0x – One of the things I love about time travel stories, its suspense instead of surprise. It just turns out that Shinji ended up in a world where everything is a degree off. It all adds up in the end. Thanks, I hope you enjoy the future!  
skyf0x – 我喜欢时间旅行故事的原因之一，就是它的悬念而非惊喜。结果只是真嗣来到了一个一切都偏差了一点的世界。最终这一切都会串联起来。谢谢，希望你喜欢后续！**

**Guest – 'it is written'  
Guest – '此乃天命'**

**calborghete – Thanks! Sometimes it's little things that can have the most impact.  
calborghete – 谢谢！有时候，微小的细节最能产生深远的影响。**

**Berix – Thank you! I didn't see too many Rebuild stories so here we are, and I agree 3.33 was only 1 ½ hours and refused to explain anything, it's alright to make the audience feel like Shinji (confused and lost), but damn you gotta give us some explanations otherwise why care! Especially when you could have had another half an hour for bits to explain stuff, we could have just jumped back to the** _**Wunder**_ **with Asuka and Misato once and awhile to get some nuggets of info. Ah you noticed that name, didn't you? During the break I'm hoping to go back with a fine comb and hopefully fix those mistakes, typically I notice them after an upload and update the chapter.**  
Berix – 感谢支持！我之前没看到太多关于《新世纪福音战士新剧场版》的故事，所以就有了这篇。我同意，3.33 只有 1 小时 30 分钟，而且拒绝解释任何事情，让观众像真嗣一样感到困惑和迷失是可以的，但该死的，你得给我们一些解释，否则我们为什么要关心！尤其是在本可以再延长半小时来解释一些事情的情况下，我们完全可以时不时地回到 Wunder 号上，看看明日香和美里，获取一些信息片段。啊，你注意到那个名字了，对吧？在休息期间，我希望能仔细检查一遍，希望能修正那些错误，通常我都是在上传后才发现并更新chapter的。

**soryu-asuka-langley – The WonderSwan is a nice mirror to Shinji's SDAT player. Shikinami is a bit different to Soryu in that she feels the same false sense of maturity, but its from always being alone instead of the trauma of her mother's death. Shikinami is definitely trying to figure out what she feels and why Shinji is sticking around despite her behavior. Because she's never had someone give her unconditional love before, so she doesn't understand why he's still there when she's not giving him anything.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷 —— WonderSwan 是映照真嗣 SDAT 播放器的一面好镜子。式波与惣流有些不同，她同样感受到一种虚假的成熟感，但这源于她一直以来的孤独，而非母亲去世的创伤。式波显然在努力弄清楚自己的感受以及为什么真嗣会不顾她的行为而留在她身边。因为她从未体验过无条件的爱，所以不明白为什么在她什么都没给予他时，他依然在那里。**

**Hoodiebud - Haha, Thanks. Where's that Spongebob meme? *Write that down, Write that down!*  
Hoodiebud - 哈哈，谢谢。那个海绵宝宝的梗在哪儿？*记下来，记下来！***

**Until Next Time. 下次再会。**

### Chapter 24: "…nothing is lost, it's just frozen in frost…"  
Chapter 24: "…没有什么会消失，只是被冻结在霜雪中…"

Shinji knew this was wrong, he knew this was selfish, he knew this was only for his own nostalgia, even if it wasn't exactly what had happened.  
真嗣知道这是错误的，他知道这是自私的，他知道这只是为了自己的怀旧之情，即便这并非完全如当初所发生的那样。

But it was so much fun.  
但真的太有趣了。

The virtual Unit-01 tried to keep its balance as he jumped from ship to ship, doing its best to avoid the flurry of attacks from the Seventh Angel.  
虚拟的零号机试图在从一艘船跳到另一艘船时保持平衡，竭尽全力躲避第七使徒的密集攻击。

A virtual fleet surrounded the Angel Asuka has single handedly been able to kill, but she had basically paradropped down onto it, the two of them were going to have to find a way up to the core.  
一支虚拟舰队包围了明日香单枪匹马就能击败的使徒，但她基本上是空降下来的，两人将不得不设法接近核心。

"Are you just going to dance around all day or actually help Third?!" Asuka shouted at him as the destroyer she had just jumped off of was blown out of the water.  
“你打算整天跳舞还是真的帮三号一把？！”明日香对他大喊，她刚跳下的那艘驱逐舰已被炸成碎片。

Shinji couldn't help but smile. When he had pitched this scenario to Misato, he really hadn't expected her to take him up on the idea, even with the upgraded capabilities of the simulators. After all, when were they going to be fighting in the ocean?  
真嗣忍不住笑了。当他向美里提出这个设想时，他真没想到她会接受，即便模拟器的性能已经升级。毕竟，他们什么时候会在海上作战呢？

Though, if Leliel was going to reappear at some point, he figured this would be an excellent way to train, as they would be fighting the peculiar Angel while keeping themselves off the ground, lest they be sucked inside the Angel like he had been.  
不过，如果雷里尔再次出现，他认为这将是一个极好的训练机会，因为他们将在不接触地面的情况下与这个奇特的天使战斗，以免像他之前那样被吸进天使体内。

But really, this was just for himself.  
但实际上，这只是为了他自己。

Selfish? Yes, but harmless really.  
自私吗？是的，但确实无害。

Launching himself to the supercarrier in the fleet, Shinji turned to see Unit-02 dodging the black missiles being shot at it.  
他奋力跃向舰队中的超级航母，真嗣转身看到二号机躲避着朝它射来的黑色导弹。

"Asuka, I can launch you up to the core."  
“明日香，我可以把你弹射到核心。”

Landing on a battleship, her Evangelion looked over to Unit-01, the lapse in concentration allowing the Angel to fire off another salvo at the girl.  
降落在战舰上，她的 EVA 看向零一机，这一瞬间的分神让使徒有机会向女孩发射另一轮炮火。

The Third Children didn't hesitate, throwing out an AT field to shield her, Asuka took the time given to launch herself towards Unit-01.  
第三适格者毫不犹豫，展开 AT 力场保护自己，明日香趁机向零一机冲去。

Dropping the first barrier, he threw out another above himself, waiting for her to land on it before launching the Second Child upwards.  
他撤去第一道屏障，随即在自己上方布下另一层，等待她落在这层上，再将第二适格者向上弹射。

He had seen the dark missiles coming from the side towards him and instantly he knew there wouldn't be enough time to get her far enough up there and dodge them all.  
他瞥见那些漆黑的导弹从侧面袭来，立刻意识到没有足够的时间将她送至足够高的地方并避开所有攻击。

He watched the red Evangelion climb into the air, and jump off of his AT field towards the Angel's core as the first of the projectiles hit.  
他注视着红色福音机甲腾空而起，跃离他的 AT 力场，直奔使徒的核心，而第一枚弹头已然命中。

There was no actual nerve feed to cause him any pain, but his body flinched regardless as the first impacted his EVA's shoulder, sending him down onto the carrier's deck.  
实际上并没有神经反馈来造成疼痛，但他的身体还是不由自主地一缩，第一击打在他的 EVA 肩上，将他击倒在航母甲板上。

Ironically it gave him enough time to erect an AT field as the next two had flown over him. Watching as half a dozen projectiles slammed into the barrier, the entry plug turned a shade of red, he was out of power.  
讽刺的是，这给了他足够的时间来展开 AT 力场，接下来的两发子弹从他头顶飞过。他看着半打弹头撞在屏障上，驾驶舱内一片红光，他的能量耗尽了。

He cursed his carelessness, he should have been watching his time, but now everything he had blocked was coming straight for him.  
他咒骂自己的疏忽，本该留意时间的，但现在所有被他挡下的攻击正直冲他而来。

He just shrugged, the mission was complete, Asuka would destroy the core and he…  
他只是耸了耸肩，任务已经完成，明日香会摧毁核心，而他……

Suddenly everything froze, and Misato's familiar face appeared on the screen before him. Asuka must have gotten to the core.  
突然间一切静止了，屏幕上出现了美里熟悉的面孔。明日香一定已经到达核心了。

"Great work you two, Shinji this was an excellent idea." She commented with a smile.  
“你们俩做得真棒，真嗣，这真是个绝妙的主意。”她微笑着称赞道。

"Oh please, I killed this thing by myself before!" Asuka shot back.  
“拜托，我之前可是独自干掉过这玩意儿的！”明日香回敬道。

"That was excellent teamwork, especially from you Asuka," Misato added, giving the redhead a reason to cool off "that's going to be it for today."  
"那真是出色的团队合作，尤其是你，明日香，"美里补充道，给了红发女孩一个冷静下来的理由，"今天就到此为止吧。"

She turned like she was about to cut the connection, but stopped and looked back.  
她转身似乎要切断通讯，但又停下，回头望去。

"Also, Asuka, Dr. Akagi wants to see you after you get showered and changed alright?"  
"另外，明日香，赤木博士想在你洗完澡换好衣服后见你，好吗？"

A low 'yes' was all Shinji heard as the connection was terminated.  
只听得一声低沉的‘是’，通讯便被切断了。

As the LCL drained he got the sneaking suspicion that another redhead was sitting behind him.  
随着 LCL 液体的排空，他隐约觉得背后又坐着一位红发少女。

"_Having some fun today, are we?" he could almost picture Second Children scowling at the back of his head "Looks to me like you needed to see her on the sea, just like you and me beat Gaghiel, that desperate to convince yourself she's me?"_  
“今天玩得挺开心，是吧？”他几乎能想象到二号机驾驶员在他背后皱眉的样子，“在我看来，你就像当初和我一起击败加吉尔那样，迫切地需要在海上见到她，以此来证明她就是我？”

He ignored that comment and got ready to get out of the entry plug, the last thing he wanted to do was convince himself of that.  
他无视了那句话，准备离开驾驶舱，他最不想做的就是说服自己相信这一点。

ʡʘʘʢ

"WHAT THE HELL, YOU CAN'T PUT UNIT-02 INTO CONTAINMENT!" the redhead roared.  
“搞什么鬼，你不能把二号机关进收容所！”红发女孩咆哮道。

This was the last thing she had expected today, especially with the simulator training. Why was it Unit-02 being stored?!  
这是她今天最没料到的事，尤其是在模拟训练之后。为什么偏偏是二号机被存放起来？！

Behind the three of them, Unit-02's core was being removed, as the entire body of the Evangelion was being lowering into long term storage.  
在他们三人身后，二号机的核心正在被移除，整个 EVA 机体正被缓缓降入长期储存区。

Dr. Akagi, Maya, and her stood there, in the IPEA controlled section of the underground base, each doing their best to keep themselves warm from the freezing air in the containment area.  
赤木博士、真希波和她站在那里，位于地下基地由 IPEA 控制的区域，每个人都尽力让自己在容纳区的冰冷空气中保持温暖。

"You know the stipulations of the Vatican Treaty, with the arrival of Unit-03 we have no choice." The doctor explained.  
“你知道梵蒂冈条约的规定，随着三号机的到来，我们别无选择。”博士解释道。

"Then store Unit-00, it's not even functioning!"  
"那就存放零号机吧，它甚至都不能运作！"

"We would if we could, but Europe still technically owns unit-02. We have to keep our units operational." Maya spoke up but sunk back as she earned a glare from the Second Child.  
""如果能的话我们会的，但欧洲方面仍然技术上拥有二号机。我们必须保持我们的机体运作。"" 真希波开口说道，但随即在二号适格者的瞪视下退缩了。

"It's in a political grey area right now, Euro hasn't even said if they want you to continue piloting." Ritsuko tried to explain to the girl.  
""目前这处于政治上的灰色地带，欧洲方面甚至还没表态是否要你继续驾驶。"" 律子试图向女孩解释道。

"So, you're going to throw it away even though Unit-03 doesn't have a pilot, hell we don't know if it even works yet?!" she asked, addressing the first part of that statement.  
“所以，即使 03 号机没有驾驶员，甚至我们还不确定它是否能正常运作，你也要把它丢弃吗？！”她问道，针对了那句话的前半部分。

Ritsuko sighed "We're not throwing it away, and all preliminary tests in the US were fine Asuka plus Misato is working to find a suitable pilot right now."  
律子叹了口气，“我们并没有要丢弃它，而且在美国进行的初步测试都很好，明日香，再加上美里正在努力寻找合适的驾驶员。”

The girl had nothing else, the stupidity of the situation was unbearable but what else could she even say to convince the doctor in front of her?  
女孩无话可说，这情况的愚蠢程度让她难以忍受，但她还能对眼前的医生说什么来劝服她呢？

"But Unit-02 is mine! You don't have anyone else to pilot it!" She blurted out. Sure, that was a good point, any other would-be pilot had failed so far, or at least that's what the reports had told her.  
“但零二号机是我的！你没有其他人可以驾驶它！”她脱口而出。确实，这是个有力的论点，到目前为止，其他潜在的驾驶员要么失败了，要么至少报告上是这么说的。

"It's a combat weapon Asuka, we have a backup plan for everything and that includes the pilot." Ritsuko mumbled, walking away from the girl with Maya close behind.  
“这是战斗武器，明日香，我们对所有事情都有备用计划，包括驾驶员。”律子咕哝着，从女孩身边走开，真希波紧随其后。

How could they even say that, after the years of training she had invested into it?  
他们怎么能这么说，在她投入了那么多年的训练之后？

After how much of her life she had given to the EVA.  
在她的一生中，有多少已经奉献给了 EVA。

Turning around the redhead just watched as her beloved Evangelion was lowered deeper into the pit it'd be stored in.  
红发女子转过身，眼睁睁看着她心爱的福音战士被缓缓降入它将被存放的深坑中。

An emptiness seemed to form in her chest at the sight, everything she had worked for so swiftly taken away for no apparent reason.  
这一幕让她胸中似乎形成了一种空虚感，她为之努力的一切就这样毫无明显理由地迅速被夺走。

Her teeth grinded at the annoyance, no, anger that was bubbling up inside her for what they were doing to her.  
她的牙齿因恼怒——不，是愤怒——而咬得咯咯作响，他们对她所做的一切让她怒火中烧。

"This is wrong..." she mumbled to herself "the cockpit of an EVA is the only place…."  
“这不对……”她喃喃自语，“EVA 的驾驶舱才是唯一的地方……”

She stopped, it wasn't the only place… no there was another, one that she had only just found.  
她停了下来，这里并非唯一的地方……不，还有另一个，一个她刚刚才发现的地方。

The question was if it was enough for her now that her Unit-02 was taken from her?  
问题是，现在她的二号机被夺走了，这对她来说是否足够？

ʡʘʘʢ

The Second Child just stood in front of the elevator awaiting its arrival. The time it was taking to get to her was only compounding her annoyance for the day.  
第二适任者只是站在电梯前等待它的到来。电梯到达她这里所花的时间，只是让她的烦躁感愈发加剧。

The light ding of its arrival brought her back from her thoughts and the sight of a certain bluenette only caused her emotions to flair.  
那清脆的提示音将她从思绪中拉回，而眼前那抹蓝发的身影只让她的情绪更加激荡。

Narrowing her eyes, she just went around the First Child, resting up against the side of the elevator while the pale girl just stared blankly at the doors in front of her.  
她眯起眼睛，绕过第一适格者，靠在电梯一侧，而那位苍白的女孩只是茫然地盯着面前的门。

For the longest of moments, nothing was said between the two and Asuka was quite content with that, she didn't need to hear anything from the commander's pet.  
在最长久的沉默中，两人之间未发一言，明日香对此颇为满意，她不需要从指挥官的宠儿那里听到任何话。

Until Rei decided to speak up  
直到丽决定开口

"The EVAs only mirror what's in our hearts." The girl said in her trademarked soft monotone voice.  
“EVA 只是反映我们内心的镜子。”女孩用她标志性的轻柔单调声音说道。

"What did you say?" she snapped at the girl, who hadn't even bothered to turn to her.  
“你说什么？”她厉声问那个女孩，对方甚至懒得转过身来。

"You should not rely on EVAs, there's plenty of happiness for you in the world outside."  
"你不该依赖 EVA，外面的世界有足够多的幸福等着你。"

Oh, that was rich coming from her!  
哦，这话从她嘴里说出来真是讽刺！

"What would you know anything about it?! Don't lecture me about happiness!"  
"你又懂什么？！别跟我谈什么幸福！"

The bluenette said nothing, just staring at the doors in front of her, which caused the redhead's anger to flare even more.  
蓝发女孩一言不发，只是盯着她面前的门，这让红发女孩的怒火更加炽烈。

"I actually worked to be pilot, I was selected purely because of my skill, I didn't get it through connections like you did!" she snapped.  
“我可是靠实力成为驾驶员的，纯粹是因为我的技能被选中，不像你那样靠关系！”她厉声说道。

"I cannot help it, I am tied to it, the only human connections I have are through the EVA."  
“我没办法，我被它束缚着，我唯一的人际关系都是通过 EVA 建立的。”

"SHUT UP! You're only the commanders favorite because you're a suck up, an obedient little doll that does everything he says!" Asuka snapped at the girl.  
"闭嘴！你只是因为会拍马屁，是个唯命是从的小玩偶，才成为指挥官的宠儿！" 明日香对女孩怒吼道。

"I am not a doll."  
"我不是玩偶。"

"You're a doll!" she roared, pulling back her arm "Know a little more about yourself!"  
"你就是个玩偶！" 她咆哮着，挥起手臂，"认清你自己吧！"

She brought her palm down, wanting to slab the back of that stupid doll's head, but instead her blue eyes were met with the red of her target's.  
她举起手掌，想要狠狠拍在那愚蠢玩偶的后脑勺上，但映入她湛蓝眼眸的却是目标的红色。

Asuka's eyes wandering to the hand on her forearm which had stopped her strike and she took note of how it was now covered in nearly a dozen band-aids. She just let her gaze fall to her own left hand which had a mere two.  
明日香的眼神飘向了那只抓住她前臂阻止了攻击的手，注意到上面几乎贴满了创可贴。她只是让自己的目光落在了自己左手上，那里只有两个。

"You've got some nerve for a doll." She mumbled as the elevator dinged, announcing they had arrived to her floor.  
“你这玩偶还真有点胆量。”她喃喃自语，电梯叮的一声响起，宣告她们已经到达她的楼层。

As the doors opened, Asuka passed the First Child nearly checking her with her shoulder. The girl stopped between the elevator doors, not bothering to turn back to the girl for her question.  
随着门打开，明日香几乎用肩膀撞到了第一适格者。女孩在电梯门之间停下，懒得回头向她提问。

"I've got a question for you. What do you really think of the Idiot?" she asked.  
“我有问题问你。你到底怎么看待那个白痴？”她问道。

"Idiot?" How typically clueless.  
“白痴？”真是典型的无知。

"I'm obviously talking about, Stupid Shinji." She spat as she turned her head to the side to get some sort of view of the girl. "What do I think? Let's hear it."  
“我显然是在说，笨蛋真嗣。”她扭头向旁边，试图看清那女孩的样子，“我怎么想？说来听听。”

"I'm... not sure." She said softly.  
“我……不太确定。”她轻声说道。

"You Japanese are so reserved; just say how you feel dammit!" she barked, now turning fully, her face contorted in anger.  
"你们日本人真是太含蓄了；直接说出你的感受吧，该死的！" 她咆哮道，现在完全转过身来，脸上因愤怒而扭曲。

The pale girl paused for a moment, looking down and not making eye contact with the redhead.  
苍白的女孩停顿了一下，低头不语，没有与红发女子对视。

"I don't know, although, being with him makes me feel… warm inside and I want him to… to feel the same way. I want him to get along with his father, and to feel warm inside, that's all." She mumbled out.  
“我不知道，但和他在一起让我感觉……内心温暖，我希望他也能……有同样的感觉。我希望他能和父亲相处融洽，也能感到内心的温暖，仅此而已。”她低声说道。

Asuka's eyes narrowed, but she just turned, her back again to the bluenette.  
明日香的眼神一紧，但她只是转过身去，再次背对着蓝发女孩。

"Is that so?" she whispered before storming away from the elevator.  
“是吗？”她低声说道，随即怒气冲冲地离开了电梯。

She strode down the hallway, with no one around she didn't care how angry she looked.  
她大步走在走廊上，四周无人，她不在乎自己看起来有多愤怒。

"She's just as much of an idiot as Shinji!" she mumbled to herself as she marched.  
“她和真嗣一样是个大笨蛋！”她一边大步走着，一边喃喃自语。

"That means you're in love with him!"  
“那意味着你爱上他了！”

Asuka stopped mid step, her anger evaporated, replaced with another feeling.  
明日香突然停下脚步，怒气消散，取而代之的是另一种情感。

Was that fear? 那是恐惧吗？

Her EVA was gone, that thing that she had devoted her life to was taken from her, stolen from her, but she didn't feel empty like she expected to. No, she had something else, she had _someone_ else.  
她的 EVA 消失了，那个她毕生奉献的东西被夺走了，从她身边偷走了，但她并没有感到预期的空虚。不，她有别的东西，她有另一个人。

She had Shinji. 她有真嗣。

Is that what this was?  
这就是这一切的原因吗？

Despite everything, the idiot had promised to be there, despite the fact she had to sleep next to him constantly since her nightmares had come back, despite the fact that he had helped her or that he never goaded over her when he beat her.  
尽管一切，那个傻瓜承诺过会在那里，尽管她不得不一直睡在他旁边，因为她的噩梦又回来了，尽管他帮助过她，或者他从未在她被打败时嘲讽她。

She had done nothing for him…  
她没有为他做过任何事……

She had just been using him… she had just taken from him, his cooking and cleaning, taken… his help with her kanji, taken… his warmth and company to fend off the night, taken.  
她刚刚一直在利用他……她只是从他那里索取，他的烹饪和清洁，索取……他帮忙解决汉字难题，索取……他的温暖和陪伴来驱散夜晚的孤寂，索取。

Her mind wandered back to how many bandages Rei's hand had as she brought up her own to see the lonely two she had acquired.  
她的思绪飘回到丽手上有多少绷带，她抬起自己的手，看到那孤单的两条绷带，是她所获得的。

He had done so much for her, and for what?  
他为她做了这么多，又是为了什么呢？

To be verbally abused whenever he tried to get close? Being called an idiot at every turn? Being basically ignored whenever they were outside Misato's apartment?  
每当他试图靠近时就被言语侮辱？处处被骂作傻瓜？每当他们离开美里公寓时就被基本无视？

Why did he stay? 他为何留下？

Why _should_ he stay… when he could just as easily give his warmth to someone who would do for him everything he had done for her?  
他为何应该留下……当他可以轻易将温暖给予一个会为他做他所做的一切的人时？

She couldn't even take his nightmares away; she couldn't even cook for him… she didn't even really know what she felt towards the boy…  
她甚至无法驱散他的噩梦；她甚至无法为他烹饪……她甚至不太清楚自己对这个男孩的感情……

But Rei… Rei at least could tell someone how she felt about him, the _doll_ could tell _her_ of all people that she was in love with him, even if she didn't quite realize it. The girl would probably do anything for the boy, just like the good pet she was.  
但丽……至少丽能告诉别人她对他的感觉，这个玩偶能告诉她，她爱上了他，即使她自己还没完全意识到。这个女孩可能会为这个男孩做任何事，就像她作为忠实宠物那样。

Was _she_ in love with him?  
她爱上他了吗？

Was Asuka Langely Shikinami in love with that idiot?  
明日香·兰格雷·式波真的爱上了那个白痴吗？

Love. 爱。

What did that even mean?  
那到底是什么意思？

What was it supposed to mean?  
这究竟意味着什么？

The girl had always been alone, through her time in the orphanage, to her time competing to pilot the EVAs. Even in Unit-02 she had felt alone.  
那女孩一直孤身一人，从孤儿院时期到竞选成为 EVA 驾驶员的日子，即便在二号机中，她也感到孤独。

And she hadn't wanted anyone else to be with her either, she didn't want friends that would distract from her life as a pilot, who would cause her to lose focus of that one thing she had dedicated her life to… the one thing that gave her life meaning, at least that was what she had told herself.  
她也不希望任何人陪伴，她不需要那些会分散她作为驾驶员生活的朋友，那些会导致她失去对唯一目标的专注的人……那是她一生所奉献的事物，至少她曾这样告诉自己，那是赋予她生命意义的东西。

Until now. 直到现在。

Until someone had weathered that barrier she had constructed around her heart. Who had broken through it with such ease that it almost insulted her. Who, from the first time they met, had only worked to be closer to her and then promised to never leave her. Who somehow always knew what to say and even when she spat anything good he said back in his face… he still accepted her.  
直到有人穿越了她心上筑起的那道屏障。那人如此轻易地突破了它，几乎让她感到被冒犯。从他们初次相遇起，他就只致力于与她更亲近，并承诺永远不会离开她。不知为何，他总能知道该说什么，即便她将他说的任何好话都吐回他脸上……他依然接纳了她。

Now Rei was going to give him something, she was going to give him something out of love, the girl was going to do something for him when she herself was seemingly incapable of doing anything for the boy.  
现在丽要给他些什么了，她要出于爱给他些什么，这个女孩要在她自己似乎无法为男孩做任何事的时候为他做些什么。

_But he had promised her…  
但他曾向她承诺过……_

As if promises couldn't be broken…  
仿佛承诺不会被打破……

That realization hit her like an angel… the sudden thought that he was the first person who she _didn't_ want to leave her alone.  
那一刻的领悟如天使般降临……她突然意识到，他是第一个她不愿让其独自留下的人。

She was afraid that Rei would take him from her. That she would lure him away from her so the redhead would be stuck with nightmares and cold nights once again.  
她害怕丽会把他从她身边夺走。她会引诱他离开她，让红发女孩再次陷入噩梦和寒冷的夜晚。

That scared, no… that _terrified_ her. More than any Angel could.  
这让她害怕，不……是让她恐惧至极。比任何使徒都更甚。

Unit-02 had been stripped from her, now all she had was Shinji and she wouldn't let him be taken from her.  
零二号机已被夺走，如今她只剩下真嗣，她绝不会让他再离开自己。

No, she would give him something to make him stay.  
不，她会给他一些东西，让他留下。

The girl finally took another step forwards and for the first time in a very long while, it was into the unknown.  
女孩终于又向前迈了一步，这是许久以来，她第一次踏入未知。

**The thing about Shikinami vs Soryu is that being and orphan means that Shiki doesn't have that same understanding of love that Soryu would have. Soryu had her mother to even if her work took away from her time with her daughter, but Shikinami's never know unconditional love, she cant even really comprehend it. So Rei doing something for Shinji probably would freak her out, not to mention her Unit-02 is taken away right before she realizes Rei 'loves' Shinji.  
关于式波与惣流之间的差异，成为孤儿意味着式波没有惣流那种对爱的理解。惣流有她的母亲，即使工作占用了她与女儿相处的时间，但式波从未体验过无条件的爱，她甚至无法真正理解它。因此，如果绫波为真嗣做些什么，可能会让她感到恐慌，更不用说在她意识到绫波‘爱’真嗣之前，她的二号机就被夺走了。  
**

**This is one of those moments where the sub and dub kinda give different wording/meaning, in the dub Asuka muses that Rei 'likes' Shinji, while in the sub, she muses that Rei is 'in love with him'. So I went with the clearer option.  
这是那种字幕和配音版本给出不同措辞/含义的时刻，在配音版中，明日香沉思绫波‘喜欢’真嗣，而在字幕版中，她沉思绫波‘爱上了他’。所以我选择了更明确的选项。**

**Oh, now this is getting very interesting and I know everyone is excited/terrified about Unit-03.  
哦，现在这变得非常有趣了，我知道大家对于三号机的出现既兴奋又害怕。**

**The clock is ticking… 时钟在滴答作响……**

**SHOUTOUTS! 特别鸣谢！**

**deathbringer374 – I do find it funny when people pair Asuka with other people, isn't the whole point that Shinji and Asuka are the only ones who can understand each other? Anything else would probably just be hollow.  
deathbringer374 – 我确实觉得人们把明日香和其他人配对很有趣，难道不是因为只有真嗣和明日香能互相理解才是重点吗？其他的配对可能都只是空洞的。**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – Yeah, I'm basically thinking I'll just spoil it when I finish this first part, might as well, but we're not done yet!  
UltraSpink of Da USA – 是啊，我基本上想在完成第一部分后剧透一下，反正也快了，但我们还没完呢！**

**Su Exodus – I think Mari can be used as basically a blank slate to do whatever you want with her, its not my fault Anno didn't give us any explanations, its almost like she's a canon character that can be used like an OC at this point (as long as she's a hyperactive extrovert/ adrenaline junkie/ whatever the heck she is.  
Su Exodus – 我认为玛丽基本上可以作为一个空白画布，任你塑造，这不是我的错，是庵野没有给我们任何解释，她几乎就像一个可以像 OC 一样使用的官方角色（只要她是那种超级活跃的外向者/冒险狂/或者其他任何她现在的样子）。**

**Berix – Thanks! Yeah, since he was always supposed to disregard the pilot's life for Bardiel he should think that he'd be in trouble for trying to save them. Yes! Keep up the nitpicks! To fix a problem first you need to know there is one, so definitely point anything else out, thanks! Hopefully it's more cohesive in this chapter.  
Berix – 谢谢！是的，既然他一直应该为了巴迪尔而忽视驾驶员的生命，他应该会认为试图救他们会惹上麻烦。没错！继续挑刺吧！要解决问题，首先得知道问题的存在，所以请务必指出其他任何问题，谢谢！希望在这篇chapter中更加连贯。**

**Greg242 – Um, nope, she's working for the IPEA, like we see in the movie so she's not piloting Unit-03, this just really explains her plugsuit and the fact they release Unit-02 for her in the movie.  
Greg242 – 呃，不是的，她在电影中为 IPEA 工作，所以她并没有驾驶 03 号机，这正好解释了她的插入服以及电影中他们为她释放 02 号机的事实。**

**EvaPilotFair – I mean who else could he ask honestly? And I think he has a closer relationship with Kensuke vs Togi, because of Kensuke sharing that he's like Shinji in NGE when he runs away and bumps into Kensuke. Hence the flashbacks to that.  
EvaPilotFair – 我的意思是，他还能诚实地向谁求助呢？而且我觉得他与剑介的关系比与东治更亲近，因为剑介曾分享过自己在原作《新世纪福音战士》中像真嗣一样逃跑并撞上剑介的经历。因此才有了那些闪回的记忆。**

**dyinglittelstar – Now is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.  
dyinglittelstar – 现在并非终点。它甚至不是结束的序幕。但或许，它是序幕的尾声。**

**A Guy x2 – Wow, we got clones here, as for Shinji, well, if everyone brought their puzzle pieces together… but we're not quite there yet.  
A Guy x2 – 哇，我们这里出现了克隆人，至于真嗣，嗯，如果大家把拼图碎片都凑齐的话……但我们还没完全到那一步。**

**skyf0x – Yes, allow that tension to build!  
skyf0x – 是的，让那种紧张感慢慢积累吧！**

**soryu-asuka-langley – I'm gonna be honesty, I've been very cautious, and that was not from spoilers, but I guess if there's something there, I'll be pleasantly surprised when I do read spoilers during the first break. As for the dance…  
soryu-asuka-langley – 老实说，我一直非常谨慎，这并非来自剧透，但我想如果有什么的话，当我第一次休息时阅读剧透，我会感到惊喜。至于舞蹈……**

**calborghete – Shinji is always going to try to protect his friends, one more than others, but I think that's realistically be the person he'd become after the events of EOE and going into the events of the story.  
calborghete – 真嗣总是会试图保护他的朋友们，其中一位尤为特别，但我认为这正是他在《EOE》事件后成长为的人，并由此步入故事的情节之中。**

**Alright, there's probably not going to be a chapter this weekend, but that's not 100%.

### Chapter 25: "…The best things in life are free…"  
Chapter 25: "…生命中最美好的事物都是免费的…"

_Too many slipups. 失误太多了。_

_That's why he was here.  
这就是他来这里的原因。_

_Sitting in an exam room waiting for Dr. Akagi, not his favorite place to be, but he earned this.  
坐在检查室里等待赤木博士，虽然这不是他最喜欢待的地方，但这是他应得的。_

_He was trying to get back on his feet, trying to somehow pull himself together after giving up for so many lives.  
他正努力重新站起来，试图在放弃那么多生命之后，以某种方式重新振作起来。_

_But things couldn't go back to the way they were.  
但一切已无法回到从前。_

_Not when she was here now.  
如今她就在这里，一切已不同往昔。_

The bandaged girl just leaned against the wall and glared at him.  
那缠着绷带的女孩只是倚墙而立，冷冷地瞪着他。

"Gott this is boring." She mumbled as she stretched out, her wounds seemingly having no effect on her.  
“天哪，真无聊。”她喃喃自语，伸展着身体，伤口似乎对她毫无影响。

_She hadn't just shown up, at first, he just heard her voice, a whisper in his ear, which he too easily attributed to the wind or anything that made him feel like he wasn't slowly going insane.  
她并非突然出现，起初，他只听到她的声音，耳边轻语，他轻易地将其归咎于风声或其他任何让他感觉自己并未逐渐陷入疯狂的事物。_

_Then it became too clear that someone was talking to him.  
随后，情况变得愈发明显，有人在对他讲话。_

_Then he had responded, simply out of interest, and that was when he saw her for the first time.  
那时，他纯粹出于好奇回应了她，那也是他第一次见到她。_

_To say he nearly screamed would be an understatement.  
说他差点尖叫都算轻描淡写。_

_Then she was there with increasing frequency, commenting on things, berating him for his actions, and those of others.  
后来她出现的频率越来越高，对各种事情发表评论，对他的行为，以及其他人的行为进行指责。_

_He had done his best to ignore her, he had done his best to not acknowledge the bandaged phantom that shadowed his movements, but once in a while he had to, if not for some peace and quiet, then for his own sanity.  
他尽了最大努力去忽视她，竭力不去理会那个如影随形、缠着绷带的幻影，但偶尔也不得不如此，若非为了些许宁静，便是为了自己的心智。_

_Was she really there? How could she be? How could she be real despite her constant taunting that she was in fact, real.  
她真的在那里吗？她怎么可能存在？尽管她不断挑衅说自己确实存在，她又怎会是真实的呢？_

_Now he was reaping the benefits.  
如今他正享受着这些成果。_

_The boy was sure there were cameras in here and he was also certain that he had been more than careless when actually addressing her around NERV.  
男孩确信这里装有摄像头，而且他也很清楚，自己在 NERV 里与她交谈时确实过于大意了。_

_Shinji was sure that was why he was here, talking to someone you know isn't really there is hardly considered 'normal'.  
真嗣确信这就是他来这里的原因，和一个实际上并不存在的人交谈，这几乎不能被视为‘正常’。_

"You know Third, you should really stop trying to get close to her, you know all you're going to do is hurt her." She commented out of boredom, referring to the only other redhead he knew, one that was actually real.  
“你知道吗，三号，你真该停止试图接近她，你知道你只会伤害她。”她无聊地评论道，指的是他认识的另一位红发女孩，一个真正存在的人。

_If anything, she was honest, he knew that was true, she was just saying the quiet part loud for him, the part that he'd rather just ignore.  
如果说有什么不同，那就是她很诚实，他知道这是真的，她只是把那些他宁愿忽略的悄悄话大声说给他听。_

_But she needed him,_ Asuka _needed him, she needed to work through that pain, so she didn't succumb to her own misery._  
但她需要他，明日香需要他，她需要克服那份痛苦，以免被自己的不幸吞噬。

_The door opened to reveal a familiar blonde who's presence did not bring him an ounce of joy, instead it just brought him anger, something that he pushed down.  
门一开，一个熟悉的金发女子出现在眼前，她的出现并未给他带来一丝喜悦，反倒激起了他的愤怒，尽管他努力压抑着。_

_Sitting down she set down her clipboard, and took off her glasses. She'd probably been shutting down what seemed like a dozen machines that had scanned him, all in an attempt to find something.  
她坐下来，放下手中的夹板，摘掉了眼镜。她可能已经关闭了看似一打的扫描设备，试图从中找到些什么。_

"_So why are we doing this again?" he asked in the best possible voice to sound confused as to why he was here._  
“那么，我们为什么还要这么做呢？”他用尽可能让人感到困惑的语气问道，不明白自己为何会在这里。

"_Oh, just a standard checkup with basic screenings." She replied. "No abnormal changes in diet for you?"_  
“哦，只是例行检查，做一些基本筛查。”她回答道，“你的饮食没有异常变化吧？”

"_No."_ "不。"

"_Any unexplained audio-visual stimulations?"_  
"有任何无法解释的视听刺激吗？"

"_What?" he asked, trying to pretend to be a boy with far less experience._  
“什么？”他问道，试图装作一个经验远不如实际的男孩。

"_Voices, when you're alone do you see or hear anything?" the blonde asked again._  
"声音，当你独自一人时，你会看到或听到什么吗？"金发女子再次问道。

_He just shrugged "Nope, I don't see anybody."  
他只是耸了耸肩，“没有，我没看到任何人。”_

_The doctor scribbled down on her pad one last time.  
医生最后一次在她的本子上匆匆写下几笔。_

"_Alright, you're good to go."_  
“好了，你可以走了。”

_Walking out the door he grumbled do himself about what a waste of time this was, but he didn't hear the doctor's pen fall out of her hand behind him  
他走出门口，嘴里咕哝着这完全是浪费时间，却没听到医生手中的笔在他身后掉落的声音。_

_He couldn't have known what was going through her head as she thought about what he said.  
他不可能知道她脑海中正翻涌着什么，思考着他所说的话。_

_And he couldn't have known about the words that came as a whisper from her mouth.  
而他也不可能听到她嘴边轻声吐露的那些话语。_

"_Anybody… he said 'I don't see anybody'…"_  
“任何人……他说‘我没看到任何人’……”

ʡʘʘʢ

The boy's eyes snapped open and he immediately groaned at the dull pain in his back shot through him.  
男孩的眼睛猛地睁开，随即因背上传来的隐痛而呻吟出声。

Grumbling to himself, Shinji brought himself off the floor and up into a sitting position. Perhaps getting no sleep at all was a bad idea every night.  
自言自语地抱怨着，真嗣从地板上起身，坐了起来。或许每晚都不睡觉真是个糟糕的主意。

He was barely making it though the days now, catching up on sleep right after school instead. He hadn't even meant to sleep this time; he was just going to rest his eyes.  
他现在几乎撑不过每一天，放学后立刻补觉。这次他本没打算睡着的，只是想闭目养神一下。

Looking up to the window, he could tell it was late afternoon, the sun was starting to set and with Misato gone out (probably with Kaji if he had to guess) he wouldn't have to make a giant dinner.  
抬头望向窗外，他知道已是傍晚时分，太阳开始西沉，而且美里出门了（他猜可能是和加持在一起），他不必准备丰盛的晚餐。

Speaking of dinners… his eyes landed on the envelope next to him. Rei seemed to be hosting some sort of dinner party for them, the invitation had been so jarring that he couldn't really process it at first. Misato, Asuka, him, and Ritsuko were all invited, as well as the commander himself.  
说到晚餐……他的目光落在了旁边的信封上。丽似乎要为他们举办一场晚宴，邀请函来得如此突然，以至于他一开始都没能反应过来。美里、明日香、他、律子，还有司令本人都收到了邀请。

Shinji had nearly laughed at it when he first read the invitation. Poor Rei, as if the man would ever show up to a dinner party, let alone one which himself was invited as well. He just shook his head; it might just be a bit of fun before dealing with Unit-03 which should be in a few days' time.  
真嗣第一次看到邀请函时差点笑出声来。可怜的丽，那人怎么可能来参加晚宴，更别提自己也受邀的场合了。他只是摇了摇头；或许在几天后处理三号机之前，这倒是个轻松的调剂。

The thought of Bardiel made his stomach drop, but the reassurance that he had saved Toji nearly every time since his first life gave him some peace of mind.  
一想到巴迪尔，他的胃就一阵翻腾，但想到自从重生以来，他几乎每次都救了剑介，这让他稍感安心。

Didn't mean he was any less nervous about it.  
这并不意味着他对这件事就不那么紧张了。

Groaning as he stood up, his joints popped and cracked as he rubbed his back from his nap on the hard floor.  
他站起身时发出呻吟，关节咔咔作响，揉着因在硬地板上小憩而酸痛的背部。

"_Someone's getting old." Soryu muttered as she sat in the corner, playing with a bit of her bandages._  
“有人开始显老了。”Soryu 坐在角落里喃喃自语，摆弄着绷带的一角。

He waved the comment away and groggily made his way out into the kitchen before he was stopped dead in his tracks by the sight in front of him.  
他挥手将评论抛诸脑后，昏昏沉沉地走向厨房，却在眼前的一幕中猛然停住了脚步。

Chaos. 混乱。

Yes, that was the correct word, chaos. How he had slept through the N2 mine detonation in the kitchen was beyond him, but all he could do was stand there and stare.  
没错，这个词再准确不过了，混乱。他无法理解自己是怎么在厨房里 N2 地雷爆炸时还能睡过去的，但现在他只能站在那里，目瞪口呆。

It seemed everything was strewn about, knives, forks, wooden spoons, everything and everything seemed to be placed wherever there was space. Too many pots were on the stove with one of them boiling over as each dial was turned to a different setting, some sort of sludge was currently dripping off the countertop, and Pen Pen was waiting for his food with growing agitation.  
一切似乎都散落一地，刀子、叉子、木勺，所有的东西都似乎被随意扔到了任何有空间的地方。炉子上放了太多锅，其中一个还在沸腾溢出，每个旋钮都被调到了不同的位置，某种黏糊糊的东西正从台面上滴落，而 Pen Pen 则越来越焦躁地等待着它的食物。

In the center of this mess, a certain redheaded German was doing her best to reign in the catastrophe that was unfolding.  
在这片混乱的中心，一位红发的德国姑娘正竭尽全力试图控制这场正在上演的灾难。

He wanted to laugh, he wanted to cry at the sight, he wanted to shout at her for what had become of his kitchen.  
他想笑，看到这一幕又想哭，更想对她大喊，看看他的厨房变成了什么样子。

But all he could do was stand there in shock, because _Asuka_ was trying to cook…  
但他只能震惊地站在那里，因为明日香正在尝试做饭……

It was another first for him.  
这对他来说又是一个第一次。

Asuka was actually trying to cook food, for the first time he was watching the redhead try to create something edible outside of instant ramen and MREs.  
明日香竟然在尝试烹饪食物，这是他第一次看到这位红发女孩试图制作即食拉面和军用口粮之外的可食用东西。

Though, perhaps more interestingly, she didn't have her A-10 clips in her hair, instead it was tied back, probably in an effort to keep it away from the food she was preparing. Not exactly her usual look and a bit jarring, but only because she never wore her hair in any other style really. In addition to that pink apron she had on, he had to admit, it wasn't a bad look for her.  
不过，或许更有趣的是，她没有在头发上别着 A-10 发夹，而是将头发束在脑后，大概是想避免头发沾到正在准备的食材。这并非她平时的装扮，略显突兀，但只是因为她从未尝试过其他发型。除了那件粉色的围裙，他不得不承认，这样的她看起来也挺不错。

The sight was such a contrast to the German's usual self that he just stood and watched, at least for a minute or two, before the sight became too agonizing that he had to speak up.  
这一幕与德国人平日的模样形成了鲜明对比，他只是站在那里凝视着，至少有一两分钟之久，直到这景象变得过于痛苦，他不得不开口说话。

"I didn't know you wanted to cook Asuka." He said simply as he took a step towards the girl.  
"我没想到你想煮明日香。" 他简单地说着，向女孩迈进一步。

The redhead froze, and turned to see him coming closer, he expected a look of indifference, but instead he got an exploding volcano.  
红发女孩僵住了，转身看到他走近，他本以为会看到一副冷漠的表情，却没想到迎来了一场爆发的火山。

"GO AWAY!" she roared, causing him to take a step back.  
"走开！" 她咆哮道，让他不由得后退了一步。

"Um." "嗯。"

"GO BACK TO YOUR ROOM AND WAIT TILL I CALL YOU!"  
"回你的房间去，等我叫你再出来！"

He ignored the yelling and started towards her again, "I'm sure I can hel…"  
他无视了那吼声，再次向她走去，"我确信我能帮…"

Shinji frowned as he dodged a swipe from the would-be chef as he reached the counter, maybe he should let her do this alone if he was going to get seriously injured by her hand.  
真嗣皱着眉头，躲开了那位准厨师的一击，当他到达柜台时，或许他应该让她独自完成，如果他会因为她而严重受伤的话。

It wasn't like this was an Angel.  
这毕竟不是什么使徒。

Instead of continuing to try and assault him, the anger on the girl's face receded, she instead closed her eyes and took a breath "I want to do this alone." She said calmly, her chin up.  
女孩没有继续试图攻击他，脸上的怒气消退了，她闭上眼睛，深吸了一口气，"我想独自完成。"她平静地说，下巴微微抬起。

"Are you sure?" the boy asked, once again looking at the mess that currently littered the countertop.  
“你确定吗？”男孩再次看向那堆散乱在操作台上的杂物，问道。

Asuka nodded, "Please let me do this."  
明日香点点头，“请让我来做这件事。”

He raised an eyebrow at that steady voice, the girl actually calmed down and asked politely for him to leave her to this. Asuka, whether Shikinami or Soryu, rarely, if ever, actually said the word 'please'.  
他听到那平稳的语气，不禁扬起眉毛，女孩竟然真的平静下来，礼貌地请求他让她独自处理。无论是式波还是惣流，明日香很少，甚至可以说从未真正说过‘请’字。

This was just another thing to the list of oddities that were accruing tonight.  
这不过是今晚积累的又一桩怪事罢了。

So, he took a step back and slowly made his way away from the counter.  
于是，他后退一步，缓缓地从柜台边走开。

"Th… Thank you Shinji." “谢……谢谢你，真嗣。”

The fact she thanked him was all the proof he needed that she would be alright.  
她向他道谢的事实，足以证明她会没事的。

So, he just nodded and went back to his room, doing his best to ignore the sounds of distress coming from the kitchen behind him.  
于是，他只是点点头，回到自己的房间，尽力不去理会身后厨房传来的痛苦声响。

Closing the door to his room he closed his eyes and smiled to himself.  
关上房门，他闭上眼睛，对着自己微笑。

Perhaps the girl was changing for the better.  
或许那女孩正在变得更好。

ʡʘʘʢ

"So, this new dummy system they're instating, I don't trust that thing at all!" Misato slammed her drink down as she slurred her words at the man.  
"所以，他们新推出的那个虚拟系统，我完全不信任那玩意儿！" 美里一边含糊地说着，一边重重地将杯子砸在桌上，对着那男人说道。

Both of them were seated well away from others in the restaurant Kaji had taken her to, despite his pitch that the cooking outclasses Shinji's, the woman had to admit there was something lacking in the food.  
两人在加治带她去的餐厅里远离其他客人而坐，尽管他夸口这里的烹饪远胜于真嗣的手艺，女子不得不承认这食物似乎少了些什么。

The alcohol was a different story.  
这酒精可是另一回事了。

"It's a top-secret development from Golgotha base, it's a mystery to all of us" Kaji said, smiling at the childish outburst.  
"这是来自戈尔加玛基地的绝密开发项目，对我们所有人来说都是个谜。" 加持笑着回应那孩子气的爆发。

"And we're going to let it pilot our giant mechanized weapons for us? It's insane!"  
"而我们竟然要让这东西来驾驶我们的巨型机甲？简直是疯了！"

"So, you're saying you're more comfortable with human pilots, is that it? "Kaji questioned, raising an eyebrow.  
“所以，你是说你更习惯与人类驾驶员合作，对吧？”加持挑起一边眉毛问道。

"You really trust Shinji a lot. Actually, you trust him because he's Shinji... are you sure he's trustw…"  
“你真的很信任真嗣。实际上，你信任他是因为他是真嗣……你确定他值得信赖……”

Misato slammed her hands down on the table "How could you even ask that?!" she roared. "He's done more for us than anyone!"  
美里猛地双手拍在桌上，“你怎么能问出这种问题？！”她咆哮道，“他为我们做的比任何人都多！”

Kaji was a bit taken aback by the outburst, but he composed himself. "Look… he's said some… interesting things when I've talked with him and I don't…"  
加治被这突如其来的爆发弄得有些措手不及，但他很快调整了情绪。“你看……我和他交谈时，他确实说过一些……有意思的话，而我并不……”

Misato threw up her hand "I don't want to hear it!" she interrupted.  
Misato 举起手，“我不想听！”她打断道。

The man just stared at her; she was sure his eyes were doing the best to decipher her actions.  
那男人只是盯着她；她确信他的眼睛正尽力解读她的行为。

"What really happened with the Sixth Angel?"  
"第六使徒到底发生了什么？"

He wasn't changing the topic, just adjusting his course.  
他并没有转移话题，只是调整了方向。

"I told you to read the report." She mumbled.  
“我告诉过你读那份报告。”她咕哝道。

"I don't believe the report."  
"我不相信这份报告。"

Misato said nothing, taking another swig of her sake, perhaps it was better to just tell him. He most likely already knew anyways.  
美里一言不发，又喝了一口清酒，也许直接告诉他更好。他很可能已经知道了。

"Can you at least…" "你至少能……"

"I MADE A MISTAKE!" she yelled at him, finally having enough of the man. The explosion seemed to catch her scruffy companion off guard, but as soon at that emotion had come rushing out, it receded, replaced with another.  
"我犯了个错误！" 她终于忍无可忍，朝他大吼。爆炸似乎让她的邋遢同伴措手不及，但那情绪刚涌出，便迅速退去，取而代之的是另一种情感。

Shame. 羞愧。

Her figure dropped, shoulders slouched and forward, the woman hadn't really had anyone to talk to about this, even Ritsuko… she couldn't talk to her about it.  
她的身姿低垂，肩膀前倾，这位女士其实没有人可以倾诉这些，即便是律子……她也无法向她吐露。

All she had done was hold the boy, hoping that it was all that was needed to wipe these emotions away, hell even massive alcohol consumption hasn't solved the problem like it had with her feelings towards the man before her.  
她所做的不过是抱着那个男孩，希望这足以抹去这些情感，哪怕是大量饮酒也未能像对待她对眼前这个男人那样解决这个问题。

Now… now it was all coming to a head, and having a public intoxicated emotional breakdown was the last thing she wanted.  
现在…现在一切都到了紧要关头，她最不希望的就是在公众场合酩酊大醉，情绪崩溃。

But maybe this needed to happen…  
但或许这正是需要发生的…

Somehow her figure collapsed even further, the woman pulled into herself, like she was trying to hide, like she was trying to run away from the admission, but it was too late for that, she couldn't stop it, she couldn't even slow down the words leaving her mouth.  
不知怎的，她的身形愈发佝偻，女人将自己蜷缩起来，仿佛试图躲藏，仿佛试图逃避这个承认，但为时已晚，她无法阻止，甚至无法减缓那些脱口而出的话语。

"I wanted him to fight…" the words were bitter, like she was vomiting after drinking too much "I wanted him to stay up there, to move, to do something…"  
“我希望他能战斗……”这些话苦涩无比，仿佛她在酗酒后呕吐一般，“我希望他能留在那里，动起来，做些什么……”

Her hands were shaking against her will and she could only imagine what Kaji could be thinking of her as he watched the mess in front of him.  
她的双手不由自主地颤抖着，她只能想象，当 Kaji 看着眼前的混乱时，他会怎么想她。

"…even with those screams, even when I had to turn away from this boy dying in front of me, I wanted him to fight that Angel, to find a way to fight that Angel."  
“…即便伴随着那些尖叫声，即便当我不得不转过身去，面对这个在我眼前死去的男孩，我仍希望他能与那天使抗争，找到与之抗争的方法。”

Her hands stopped, but not because of her, because the man across from her reached over and rested his own on top of hers'.  
她的手停了下来，但并非出于她的意愿，而是因为对面那个男人伸出手，轻轻地覆盖在她的手上。

She took a breath, but still couldn't look back up at him.  
她深吸了一口气，却依旧无法抬头看向他。

"I tried to think of something, anything before I brought him back, I wanted him up there, damn his pain…" she stopped closing her eyes, she didn't even deserve to look at Kaji's hands, she didn't even deserve him listening to her right now.  
"我在带他回来之前，试图想些什么，任何事，我希望他在上面，该死的他的痛苦……" 她停了下来，闭上眼睛，她甚至不配看一眼加持的手，此刻她甚至不配他听她说话。

"he was dead before we could even open the entry plug…" she finished softly "and do you know what I did?" she asked him, a few droplets falling onto her dress.  
"他在我们打开驾驶舱之前就已经死了……" 她轻声说完，"你知道我做了什么吗？" 她问他，几滴泪水落在了她的裙子上。

"What?" he asked, his voice level.  
"什么？" 他问，语气平静。

"NOTHING!" she yelled pushing herself up, finally looking back up at the man who had no expression on his face "I acted as if nothing had happened. I ignored it and threw myself back into finding a way to kill that Angel… I just killed a boy and acted like it was nothing!"  
"什么都没做！" 她大喊着站起身，终于抬头看向那个面无表情的男人，"我表现得就像什么都没发生过一样。我忽视了这一切，再次投身于寻找杀死那个使徒的方法……我刚刚杀了一个男孩，却表现得像没事发生一样！"

She fell back into her seat, her hands pulling away from his as she covered her face "I got a 14-year-old kid killed and I couldn't even go look at him for hours, I couldn't even admit it for hours…" she stopped, her voice failing her.  
她跌坐回座位上，双手从他的身上抽离，捂住脸庞，“我害死了一个 14 岁的孩子，我甚至几个小时都不敢去看他一眼，几个小时都无法承认这一点……”她顿住了，声音哽咽。

"…until it just hit me Kaji… it just… hit me, what I did, why I had done it… and I hated myself, I… I had to go see him."  
“……直到那一刻，Kaji，它……击中了我，我做了什么，为什么这么做……我恨我自己，我……我必须去见他。”

Finally, she looked back up at the man, who was still leaning forwards, not pulling back, not interrupting, not doing anything, just listening.  
最终，她重新抬头看向那个男人，他依旧前倾着身子，没有退缩，没有打断，没有做任何事，只是静静地听着。

"But he was alive…" she said with a sad smile "woke up in the morgue and found his way to the GeoFront and you know what I did? I held him… I'm the one who got him killed and I latched onto him, playing at being some kind of messed up mother, pretending I'm not some…." She stopped.  
“但他还活着……”她带着悲伤的微笑说道，“在停尸房醒来，一路找到了地底都市，而你知道我做了什么吗？我抱住了他……是我害死了他，我却紧紧抓着他，扮演着某种扭曲的母亲角色，假装自己不是……”她顿住了。

"I'm a monster." She whispered as tears began to flow silently.  
“我是个怪物。”她低声呢喃，泪水悄然滑落。

.

.

.

"So, what did you do?"  
"那么，你做了什么？"

She looked back up the man leaning halfway across the table, confusion warping her face.  
她回头看向那个半趴在桌上的男人，困惑扭曲了她的面容。

"What?" “什么？”

"What did you do after that?" he asked.  
"那之后你做了什么？" 他问道。

"I…I…" she stammered, unable to think now.  
"我…我…" 她结巴着，此刻思绪全无。

"Did you send him back out again without any worry in the world? Did you feel nothing whenever he fought another Angel?"  
"你就这样让他再次出去，毫无担忧吗？每当他与另一个天使战斗时，你难道没有一丝感觉吗？"

"Of course, I didn't!" she had regained some composure now, sitting upright instead of slouched back in her seat "but I sent him out there again…".  
"当然不是！" 她现在恢复了一些镇定，坐直了身子，不再懒散地靠在椅背上，"但我还是让他再次出去了…"

"Shinji could've refused." Kaji countered.  
"真嗣本可以拒绝的。" 加持反驳道。

"But…" "但是…"

"You're not a monster Katsuragi, you're human, just like the rest of us." He said simply, reaching out his hands to her. "You made a mistake… one that I think you've learned from, right?"  
"你不是怪物，葛城，你和我们一样，都是人。" 他简单地说道，向她伸出双手。"你犯了一个错误…我想你已经从中吸取了教训，对吧？"

"It wasn't a mistake Kaji, it was beyond that… it was beyond anything I've…"  
"那不是错误，加持，那是超越了错误的东西……超越了我所经历的一切……"

Her voice trailed off, and for a moment neither said anything.  
她的声音渐渐消失，一时间两人都没有说话。

"I heard about your reluctance with the last Angel, Rits was all in a fuss about it. If you had just sent him back out there without feeling anything, then yes, you'd be a monster Misato, but you _didn't_."  
"我听说了你对上一个使徒的犹豫，律子为此大惊小怪。如果你对他毫无感情地派他出去，那么是的，美里，你会是个怪物，但你没有。"

The woman stared into his eyes, tears beginning to form but refusing to fall.  
女人凝视着他的眼睛，泪水开始在眼眶中打转，却倔强地不肯落下。

"You didn't, you didn't just send him back out there with a disregard for him and I've heard enough from Ritsuko to know you care for the kid."  
“你没有，你不会就这样把他送回去而不顾他的安危，我从律子那里听得够多了，知道你关心那孩子。”

"I'm… I'm just…" "我……我只是……"

Yes, she cared for Shinji, him and Asuka… like her own little family, each of them forced together by tragedy, necessity, fate, and who knows what other forces, but she never thought she could live like that. Not after everything with her first family, she never thought she could let go of that to find something else, something more.  
是的，她关心真嗣、他和明日香……就像她自己的小家庭一样，他们每个人都是因为悲剧、必要性、命运，还有谁知道的其他什么力量被迫聚在一起的，但她从未想过她能那样生活。在经历了与第一个家庭的种种之后，她从未想过她能放下那些去寻找别的东西，更美好的东西。

"I'm trying Kaji… I'm trying to be better… but I don't know…"  
"我在努力，加持……我在努力变得更好……但我不知道……"

"It doesn't matter," the man interrupted her "all that matters is you're trying…"  
"没关系，" 男人打断了她，"重要的是你在尝试……"

The woman just looked into his eyes, trying to force the tears back down. She was trying to copy that steadiness in his voice and face, trying not to break down all over again.  
女人只是凝视着他的眼睛，努力抑制住泪水。她试图模仿他声音和脸上的那份沉稳，尽量不再崩溃。

Suddenly their moment was interrupted by the ringing of a phone, Misato's phone. Sniffing and composing herself, Misato dug through her purse and answered.  
突然，他们的时刻被电话铃声打断，是美里（Misato）的电话。她吸了吸鼻子，整理了一下自己，从包里翻出手机接听。

"Yes, yeah right I know. I'll have my decision for you by midnight,"  
"是的，我知道了。我会在午夜前给你答复，"

"That Rits?" "是 Rits 吗？"

"Yeah, she's harassing me about the Unit-03 test pilot."  
"嗯，她一直在催我关于 03 号机测试飞行员的事。"

"It _is_ your responsibility to choose the pilot,"  
"选择驾驶员是你的职责，"

"I know it is, it's just… out of all the days for the activation…." The woman said nothing, instead she just pressed buttons on the phone, sending a text, before putting the phone back in her purse.  
"我知道，只是……偏偏是今天激活……." 女人没有再说什么，只是按动手机上的按钮，发送了一条短信，然后将手机放回她的手提包中。

Turning back to her companion the woman wiped the last of the tears from her eyes, "What about this organization of SEELE? What do you know about it?"  
女人转回身，擦去眼角的最后一滴泪水，"关于 SEELE 这个组织，你知道些什么？"

"How'd you hear that name?" Kaji asked, raising an eyebrow.  
"你怎么听到这个名字的？"加持问道，扬起了一边的眉毛。

"Unit-04… I looked into it; the name came up. That…. and Human Instrumentality, what is NERV really up to behind the scenes?"  
初号机……我查过了；这个名字出现了。那个……还有人类补完计划，NERV 到底在幕后搞什么鬼？

"Honestly," he sat back in his seat "I'd like to know that one myself… but… I think Shinji knows something."  
老实说，"他向后靠在椅背上"我也想知道……但……我觉得真嗣知道些什么。

Misato raised an eyebrow "Shinji?" her mind started to swirl "So that's why you brought him up! What the hell did he tell you?"  
美里挑了挑眉，"真嗣？"她的思绪开始旋转，"所以你才提起他！他到底跟你说了什么？

The man said nothing, he just eyed the plate in front of him "It could be nothing," somehow, she doubted that "but I wanted to hear it from you… why you were so close to him before I said anything."  
男人一言不发，只是盯着面前的盘子，“可能没什么，”不知为何，她对此表示怀疑，“但我还是想听你亲口说……为什么在我开口之前，你和他那么亲近。”

"What aren't you telling me Kaji?"  
“你还有什么没告诉我，加持？”

He shook his head and smiled softly "Don't worry about it, just promise me you'll be careful aright?"  
他摇了摇头，温柔地笑了笑，“别担心，只要答应我你会小心，好吗？”

"Alright," she nodded "I promise."  
"好的，" 她点头道，"我保证。"

ʡʘʘʢ

She burnt the rice. 她把饭煮糊了。

Shinji didn't actually think that was possible.  
真嗣其实不认为那有可能。

But it was… and she also undercooked the beef, at the same time no less.  
但问题是……她还把牛肉煮得半生不熟，而且还是在同一时间。

Being completely honest, it wasn't the worst meal he ever had. Shinji could easily recall a certain slop that he had been served in NERV's cafeteria at one point taking first place. All he had to do was remember the taste (or lack thereof) and he could consider this meal five stars.  
老实说，这并不是他吃过的最糟糕的一餐。真嗣很容易就能回想起在 NERV 的食堂里某次吃到的烂糊糊，那才算是第一名。他只需记住那个味道（或者说没有味道），就能把这顿饭评为五星。

Looking up from his first bite, he saw Asuka doing her best to not gag on her own cooking. He would have laughed, not at her of course, but the thought of being beaten to death for the perceived insult was not something he wished for.  
从第一口抬起头来，他看到明日香正尽力不让自己被自己的烹饪呛到。他本想笑出声来，当然不是笑她，但想到可能会因为这看似的侮辱而被揍死，他就不敢了。

He had firsthand experience.  
他有过亲身体验。

So, he took another bite and grimaced at the taste, but gave a reassuring smile to the redhead, who could see quite clearly through his act.  
于是，他又咬了一口，对味道皱了皱眉，但向红发女孩露出了一个安慰的微笑，她显然看穿了他的表演。

"It's horrible, isn't it?" she asked, dejected.  
“很难吃，对吧？”她沮丧地问道。

"No, it's not that bad."  
“不，没那么糟糕。”

"Don't lie baka!" "别撒谎，笨蛋！"

Shinji blinked, Asuka hadn't called him that yet, 'stupid Shinji' sure, but 'baka' seemed to strictly be a Soryu thing.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，明日香还没这么叫过他，'笨蛋真嗣'当然有，但'baka'似乎是惣流特有的说法。

"Hey, it's your first-time cooking, you should have seen my first attempt." He said with a smile.  
"嘿，这是你第一次做饭，你该看看我第一次尝试的样子。" 他笑着说。

In reality, he never made a meal this terrible, ever. Granted he had a knack for the culinary arts, but still… the fact the girl added a cup of instant ramen to the table as a side dish might just be an indication of how aware Asuka was to this travesty.  
实际上，他从未做出过如此糟糕的饭菜。诚然，他在烹饪艺术方面颇有天赋，但即便如此……女孩在餐桌上添了一杯方便面作为配菜，这或许正表明了明日香对此灾难的认知程度。

He took another bite, his resolve to show her it wasn't too bad fighting against the muscles trying to spit the food out.  
他又咬了一口，决心向她展示这并不算太糟，尽管他的肌肉正试图将食物吐出。

"It's terrible." She said plainly, pushing away her dish and grabbing a cup of instant noodles.  
“太难吃了。”她平淡地说道，推开自己的盘子，抓起一杯方便面。

The Third Children shrugged, "Why did you want to cook in the first place?"  
第三适格者耸了耸肩，"为什么你一开始就想做饭呢？"

Asuka stopped, the fork still hovering with noodles dangling in the air. She said nothing, she didn't even look at him.  
明日香停了下来，叉子依旧悬在空中，面条摇摇欲坠。她一言不发，甚至没有看他一眼。

"Asuka?" What was this? “明日香？”这是怎么回事？

"Can't I just try something new?!" she shouted at him, before standing up and taking her instant ramen with her.  
“我就不能尝试点新东西吗？！”她冲他喊道，随即站起身，带着她的即食拉面离开了。

"Asuka!" he stood up as well and followed her before she slammed the door to her room behind her.  
“明日香！”他也站了起来，跟着她，在她砰地一声关上房门之前。

The boy just stood there, completely perplexed, he wanted to open the door, after all there were no locks, but…  
男孩只是站在那里，完全不知所措，他本想打开门，毕竟门上没有锁，但是……

_Asuka released his nose as he finally let air back into his lungs.  
阿斯克终于让空气重新进入肺部，同时松开了他的鼻子。_

_For the briefest of moments, he just stood there, like the idiot he couldn't even look at her face till she turned.  
有那么一瞬间，他只是站在那里，像个傻瓜一样，甚至不敢直视她的脸，直到她转身。_

_The redhead ran to the bathroom, the sounds of gargling being the only noise coming from her.  
红发女孩跑向浴室，只有咕噜咕噜的漱口声从她那里传来。_

"_BLEH! This isn't something you do just cause your bored!" she shouted from around the corner._  
“呸！这不是因为无聊就随便做的事！”她从拐角处喊道。

Looking back, he should have read into that.  
回想起来，他本该从中读出些端倪的。

He took a breath and began to slide the once named 'impenetrable wall of Jericho' open, but what he hadn't been expecting was a swift kick to the stomach, knocking the wind out of him and sending him to the ground.  
他深吸一口气，开始推开那扇曾被誉为‘耶利哥之墙’的坚不可摧的门，但未曾预料到的是，迎面而来的是一脚猛踢腹部，让他瞬间喘不过气来，倒在地上。

The pilot of Unit-01 sucked in air, but didn't let out so much as a yelp, he was too distracted by a different redhead standing over him now.  
初号机的驾驶员吸了口气，却没有发出半点呻吟，他的注意力完全被现在站在他面前的一位红发女子所吸引。

"_Get up, this is nothing," she scowled at him "You've walked around missing your arm before remember?"_  
“起来，这没什么，”她皱眉看着他，“你以前不是也单手走过路吗，记得吗？”

He wanted to retort about how much adrenaline was pumping through his system then, but instead Shinji just pushed himself up slowly, looking at the door, which was now back to being completely closed.  
他本想反驳说当时体内有多少肾上腺素在涌动，但最终只是慢慢站起身，目光转向那扇已经完全关闭的门。

Making is way to his feet and into the kitchen, he began to clean up the small disaster zone. What was he supposed to do? He knew he wasn't going to get anywhere when she was this violent.  
他缓缓站起身，走向厨房，开始清理这个小灾难现场。他该怎么办呢？他知道在她如此暴躁的时候，自己是不可能有什么进展的。

What the boy couldn't see was the girl currently curled up on the opposite side of her bed, instant ramen splattered on the wall, and dealing with the realization of how she had just royally screwed up.  
那男孩未曾察觉的是，此刻女孩正蜷缩在床的另一侧，泡面汤溅满了墙壁，正面对着自己刚刚彻底搞砸了一切的现实。

**Well… that went 'well' for Shikinami… didn't it? What's she going to do now?! Side note, anybody else find it strange that Shikinami uses chopsticks, even though she's from Germany? I actually can't remember Soryu ever** _**not**_ **using a fork … interesting. Also, in the English dub she calls him 'stupid Shinji' instead of 'idiot Shinji', only referring to him as 'the idiot' in the elevator scene. It's probably a translation thing with baka, but in 3.0 she instead calls him 'idiot Shinji' so that's interesting as well.**  
嗯……对式波来说，这算是‘顺利’吗？她现在该怎么办呢？！顺便一提，有人觉得奇怪吗，式波明明来自德国，却使用筷子？我确实记不清索依斯什么时候不用叉子了……挺有意思的。另外，在英文配音中，她称他为‘愚蠢的真嗣’而不是‘白痴真嗣’，只有在电梯场景中才称他为‘那个白痴’。这可能是对‘笨蛋’一词的翻译差异，但在 3.0 中，她确实称他为‘白痴真嗣’，这也挺有意思的。

**In 2.0 we don't get a solid reason as to why Misato knows about SEELE or the Human Instrumentality Project. I guess inferred that she hears about it after the incident with Unit-04 in the US, but we don't actually get a scene, I guess it's not necessary really, but it just bugged me.  
在 2.0 中，我们没有得到一个确切的理由来说明为什么美里知道 SEELE 或人类补完计划。我猜想她是在美国发生 04 号机事件后得知的，但我们并没有实际的场景来展示，或许这并不必要，但这一点确实让我有些在意。**

**SHOUTOUTS! 特别鸣谢！**

**Bwanagator – Thanks, I'm hoping it will be!  
Bwanagator – 谢谢，我也希望如此！**

**EvaPilotFair – Thanks! I think Shinji would be quite nostalgic for a time when things were 'simplier' at least compared to his current situation.  
EvaPilotFair – 谢谢！我觉得真嗣会相当怀念那个‘更简单’的时光，至少与他现在的处境相比是这样的。**

**Berix – DAMN, I thought they had character limits on reviews lol. Thanks for pointing out that stuff, though you don't have to take it upon yourself to practically proofread the thing lol. I just picked out a few things to respond to since you actually caught onto a few things. 1. I was waiting for someone to mention the whole 'Shinji referring to himself as Children', I thought someone might mention is when Kaji notes it haha, but yeah that's deliberate, in NGE, 'Children' is used even when it should be singular. So, Shinji refers to himself as 'The First Children' and Soryu 'The Second Children', I'm pretty sure this was intentional because even the updated Netflix dub uses the same wordage, while the Rebuild use proper grammar, ie 'Child' when referring to one pilot. 2. For Euro and Europe, that line it taken verbatim from the dub, Maya says 'Euro still technically owns Unit-02' and it's not clear if Europe/EU, NERV, or NERV based in Germany own Unit-02, it's never clarified, considering she uses the term 'Euro' and Asuka's 'pilot license' is revoke by Europe, plus Shikinami is a captain in the 'Euro Airforce' it might be either that, countries 'own' EVA units, but NERV operates them, or it's similar to how the US has a combat commands (AFRICOM, CENTCOM, etc.) they just have greater autonomy, it might be that NERV is separated like that, but there are retorts to either, it's a small detail and would be explored more if not for… unfortunate events. 3. When I read the child support comment, I nearly spit out my drink, but that's fair, though probably just an inch too far. Definitely a 'if I cant have all of you to myself, then I don't want anything from you' moment coming up. Finally… yes, Word defiantly auto-corrects my incorrect spelling for definitely all the time and when I'm not careful I'll just hit that first suggested word when proofing.  
Berix – 我靠，我还以为评论有字数限制呢，哈哈。谢谢你指出那些问题，不过你不必亲自来校对全文，哈哈。我只是挑了几点回应，因为你确实发现了一些细节。1. 我一直在等有人提到‘真嗣称自己为 Children’这件事，我以为当加持提到时会有人注意到，哈哈，但没错，这是故意的。在《新世纪福音战士》中，即使应该用单数形式，也经常使用‘Children’。所以，真嗣称自己为‘The First Children’，而惣流则称‘The Second Children’，我确信这是有意为之，因为即使是 Netflix 的更新版配音也使用了相同的措辞，而《Rebuild》系列则使用了正确的语法，即在指代单个驾驶员时使用‘Child’。2. 对于 Euro 和欧洲，那句话直接取自配音版本，玛雅说‘Euro 在技术上仍然拥有二号机’，但欧洲/欧盟、NERV 或德国的 NERV 是否拥有二号机并不明确，这一点从未被澄清。考虑到她使用了‘Euro’这个词，而明日香的‘飞行员执照’被欧洲吊销，加上式波是‘Euro 空军’的队长，这可能意味着国家拥有 EVA 单位，但由 NERV 操作，或者类似于美国有作战司令部（AFRICOM、CENTCOM 等），他们拥有更大的自主权。NERV 可能就是这样被分隔开的，但对此也有反驳，这是一个小细节，如果不是因为…不幸的事件，本可以进一步探讨。3. 当我读到那个关于抚养费的评论时，我差点把饮料喷出来，虽然这很公平，但可能只是稍微过了一点。这绝对是一个‘如果我不能完全拥有你，那我就不想要你任何东西’的时刻。最后…是的，Word 确实会自动纠正我拼写错误的 definitely，当我不够小心时，校对时就会直接点击第一个建议的词。**

**Su Exodus – Thanks! Hang on tight, we're gonna have one hell of a last night…  
苏《出埃及记》——谢谢！抓紧了，我们即将迎来一个疯狂的最后一夜……**

**GeHirNunDherZ – Thanks! Yes, be terrified! I think Shinji is going to be wishing 'that I could turn back time', oh wait…  
GeHirNunDherZ – 谢谢！没错，感到恐惧吧！我想真嗣会希望‘我能回到过去’，哦，等等……**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – Thanks! Hopefully this one and the next are a bit longer.  
UltraSpink of Da USA – 谢谢！希望这一篇和下一篇能稍微长一些。**

**spaztasticdragoon – Thank you very much!  
spaztasticdragoon – 非常感谢！**

**dyinglittelstar – Both… both is good. Lol  
dyinglittelstar – 两者都……两者都挺好。哈哈**

**Romulo Nidoking BR – You know, everyone keeps telling me that, so I'll have to read that story. Ah, yes, Soryu is the better match for Shinji, though whether she's really there or not is up for you to decide for now. I understand why Asuka got turned into a secondary character for the Rebuilds, though I don't think anyone likes it. In the movie format there just really isn't enough time (thought they could have made like 2-3 hour movies and improved the whole thing and I doubt anyone would have cared about the length), anyways thanks!  
罗慕洛尼多金 BR – 你知道，大家都这么跟我说，所以我得去读读那篇故事。啊，没错，惣流更适合真嗣，不过她是否真的存在，就由你来决定吧。我理解为什么在《新世纪福音战士》重制版中明日香变成了配角，虽然我觉得没人喜欢这样。电影形式下时间确实不够（其实他们完全可以制作两三小时的电影来改善整体效果，我怀疑没人会在意时长），总之谢谢啦！**

**Calborghete – Asuka's like a new driver without even a license put in a supercar, how well do you think it's going to end? haha  
卡尔博盖特——明日香就像一个连驾照都没有的新手被塞进了一辆超级跑车，你觉得这会有好结果吗？哈哈**

**skyf0x – Thank you for that, as for Asuka… well she's essentially panicking and thinks she's more mature than she is so that's a… concerning… combination…  
skyf0x – 谢谢你的提醒，至于明日香……她基本上是在恐慌中，还自以为比实际更成熟，这种组合……挺让人担忧的……**

**Guest- Oh, that… let's take this one step at a time, alright? Haha.  
客人- 哦，那个啊…我们一步一步来，好吗？哈哈。**

**A Guy – 'This is getting out of hand! Now there are two of them!' Haha, this last one was on me, I forgot to go in and forward it, I thought it automatically went thought but I might have messed with a settings, so don't worry, if it doesn't show up after two days I think then there's a problem, but just give it a day or so. Misato gets a pony… hmm, I might be able to swing that haha, you're right, this is FAR from over.  
一个家伙——“这越来越离谱了！现在有两个了！”哈哈，最后这个是我疏忽了，忘记进去转发，我以为它会自动通过，但可能是我设置搞错了，所以别担心，如果两天后还没显示，那我觉得就有问题了，不过先等个一两天吧。美里得到一匹小马……嗯，这个我或许能搞定，哈哈，你说得对，这事儿还远远没完。**

**Alright folks, extra-long chapter this week, it's that time of year for school so I'm not promising anything anymore, but expect a chapter sometime on Wednesdays for a month or so. That being said, I think this next one will be out this weekend and hopefully it doesn't explode in my face.  
好了各位，这周特别长的《一千零一夜》，又到了开学季，我不再承诺什么，但预计未来一个月的某个周三会有《一千零二夜》。话说回来，下一篇应该这周末发布，希望它不会让我措手不及。**

**Until Next Time. 下次再会。**

### Chapter 26: "…Kiss you with the kiss that wasn't true …"  
Chapter 26: "…用那并非真心的吻来吻你…"

Did he really expect to be able to sleep?  
他真的以为自己能睡得着吗？

Of course not. 当然不会。

How could he sleep after what had happened?  
经历了那样的事，他怎么可能睡得着？

His eyes wandered to his door, wishing that it would open, and his nightly partner would once again lay down next to him.  
他的目光游移到房门，心中期盼着门会打开，他的夜伴能再次躺在他身边。

Maybe they could even talk, but she was usually quiet and if all she needed was a dreamless sleep then so be it. He could do that for her.  
或许他们还能聊上几句，但她通常沉默寡言，如果她所求的只是一场无梦的睡眠，那就随她吧。他能为她做到这一点。

Looking back up at the ceiling his eyes began to close, if she wasn't coming tonight then he might get some rest at least, if she did come, he doubted he'd be able to stay awake anyways.  
他抬头再次望向天花板，眼睛开始闭合，如果她今晚不来，他至少能休息一会儿，如果她真的来了，他怀疑自己是否还能保持清醒。

One hand idly played with the Greek cross that hung around his neck, now resting on his chest. He hadn't taken it off, he should have, after all, he never wore it to bed.  
一只手漫不经心地摆弄着挂在他脖子上的希腊十字架，现在正垂在胸前。他从未摘下过它，本该摘下的，毕竟，他从不戴着它睡觉。

Shinji's mind swirled and the idea that he might get a night of sleep became more and more a fantasy.  
真嗣的思绪纷乱，他可能获得一夜安眠的想法越来越像是一个幻想。

Then his door slid open.  
接着，他的房门滑开了。

He didn't open his eyes, Shinji wanted her to take her time, obviously, he upset her somehow and if he knew anything about the fiery redhead, she might just retreat from him again if he opened his eyes and acknowledged her.  
他没有睁开眼睛，真嗣希望她能慢慢来，显然，他不知怎的让她不高兴了，如果他对那位火爆的红发女孩有所了解的话，她可能会再次从他身边退缩，如果他睁开眼睛并承认她的存在。

His ears picked up the opening of the door again, Asuka had left, but the lack of footsteps told him that she had just stepped outside his door, was she nervous?  
他的耳朵捕捉到了门再次被打开的声音，明日香已经离开，但脚步声的缺失告诉他，她只是走到了他的门外，她是在紧张吗？

What was she so apprehensive about? She hadn't even been like this the first night she laid down next to him.  
她到底在担心什么呢？就连她第一次躺在他身边的那晚，她都没有这么紧张过。

The door opened again, this time the door closed for good, but instead of the familiar weight landing next to him, he was instead greeted by the sound of her walking to the base of his sleeping arrangements.  
门再次被打开，这次门彻底关上了，但取代熟悉的重量落在他身旁的声音，他听到的却是她走向他睡眠地点的脚步声。

Confusing? Yes, but he didn't open his eyes, even when she seemingly just stood there.  
困惑吗？是的，但即便她似乎只是站在那里，他也没有睁开眼睛。

Only when he felt those feet step on either side of his legs, did he really start to get anxious.  
直到他感觉到那双脚分别踏在他的双腿两侧，他才开始真正感到焦虑。

Then just like that, he opened his eyes. His room was well lit by the moonlight, clear as can be there she was, crouching down over him and finally resting on her hands and knees over him.  
然后就这样，他睁开了眼睛。月光照亮了他的房间，清晰可见，她正蹲在他上方，最终以手膝撑地的姿势俯视着他。

She didn't have a shirt on.  
她没穿上衣。

He could see _everything_ in the moonlight.  
在月光下，他能看到一切。

As soon as he noticed… it all came rushing back…  
他一注意到……所有记忆便涌了回来……

_The hospital… 医院……_

_He was standing over her. A heart monitor beeped next to him.  
他站在她上方。心率监测器在他旁边发出哔哔声。_

"_Please… help me Asuka."_ “请……帮帮我，明日香。”

"Shinji…" “真嗣……”

He couldn't breathe. He couldn't move. His chest was on fire.  
他无法呼吸，无法动弹，胸口如同着火一般。

Her hair trickled down like a waterfall of flame, brushing against his face. Her face was getting closer.  
她的发丝如火焰瀑布般流淌而下，轻拂过他的脸颊。她的脸越来越近。

"_Wake up Asuka!"_ “快醒醒，明日香！”

" …you won't hurt me."  
" …你不会伤害我的。"

He was petrified, completely frozen as she leaned in, closer and closer to his face.  
他惊呆了，完全僵住，当她靠近，越来越近，直到她的脸庞近在咫尺。

_That night before Israfel.  
伊斯拉斐尔前夜。_

"_mama…"_ "妈妈…"

She sat down, now resting her weight onto him as she got closer…  
她坐了下来，现在将体重倚靠在他身上，随着她靠近…

He wanted to scream. 他想要尖叫。

_She was so still on the hospital bed; her cheeks were sunken.  
她静静地躺在病床上，双颊深陷。_

His whole body was on fire.  
他全身如火焚般灼热。

His whole body was frozen.  
他全身如冰封般僵硬。

"_Shinji… wanna try a kiss?"_  
"真嗣…想试试接吻吗？"

Her warm breath blew gently against his face as she got even closer…  
她的温热呼吸轻轻拂过他的脸颊，她靠得更近了……

_He was shaking her now, desperation… that's what this was.  
他现在正摇晃着她，这是绝望……这就是此刻的全部。_

"_Help me Asuka!"_ “救救我，明日香！”

"Asuka," he choked out, desperately trying to say something.  
"明日香," 他哽咽着，拼命试图说些什么。

"Yesss?" she purred, leaning closer, her lips so close to his own.  
"是吗？" 她低声呢喃，身体更靠近了些，双唇几乎贴上了他的。

"_Call me an idiot like you always do."_  
"像你平时那样，叫我傻瓜吧。"

He tried to move, but he was still frozen, he tried to think of a way to deal with this, to stop this somehow, to not hurt her.  
他试图移动，但身体依旧僵硬，他努力思考应对之策，试图以某种方式阻止这一切，不让她受到伤害。

_A fake world, a world he rejected.  
一个虚假的世界，一个他拒绝的世界。_

"_Be one with me Shinji."_  
“与我合为一体吧，真嗣。”

"We're not kids…" she started.  
“我们已经不是孩子了……”她开口道。

"_I'd say yes a million times if you just asked me, ask me to kiss you, and do other things too!"_  
“只要你问我，我愿意说一百万次愿意，问我要吻你，还有做其他事情！”

But there was only one thing he could do.  
但只有一件事他能做。

_The gown ripped open, and he just stared at her bare figure.  
长裙撕裂开来，他只是盯着她裸露的身躯。_

"Stop." “住手。”

.

.

.

He could breathe again. 他又能呼吸了。

Shinji sucked in air like a man who nearly drowned, in fact, he was sure he was hyperventilating.  
真嗣像一个差点溺水的人一样猛吸空气，事实上，他确信自己正在过度换气。

The Third Children looked at the girl, he knew those four letters would hurt her like nothing else, and sure enough, she froze, her hand still on his chest and her breath held, no longer blowing against his face.  
第三适格者看着那个女孩，他知道那四个字母会像其他任何东西一样伤害她，果然，她僵住了，手还放在他的胸口，屏住呼吸，不再对着他的脸吹气。

In his heart, he questioned how he could even reject her. How could he, the lowest of the low, the boy who killed his world… who wouldn't do anything to save her, dare to refuse her?  
在他的内心深处，他质疑自己怎么能拒绝她。他，这个世界上最卑微的人，这个毁灭了自己世界的男孩……这个不敢做任何事来拯救她的男孩，怎么敢拒绝她？

He knew that answer. 他知道那个答案。

Because he didn't deserve her, and she, without question, did not deserve someone like _him_.  
因为他不配拥有她，而她，毫无疑问，也不该遇到像他这样的人。

"_I am the lowest of the low."_  
“我是最低贱的存在。”

Beyond that why did she want _this_?  
除此之外，她为何想要这个？

"What?" she whispered, her eyes beginning to water.  
"什么？" 她低声道，眼眶开始泛红。

She was still sitting on his waist as he pushed himself up with his elbows, he wanted to run, he wanted to get as far away from her as possible, he didn't even deserve to be next to her.  
她仍坐在他腰间，他用肘部撑起身，他想要逃离，想要尽可能远离她，他甚至不配待在她身边。

He never changed. 他从未改变。

But he couldn't run away, as much as he wanted to, as much as every fiber in his body screamed at him…  
但他无法逃走，尽管他多么渴望，尽管他身体的每一根神经都在尖叫着让他离开……

All Shinji could see in front of him was that sobbing little girl who found her mother's hanging body and he was the only one in the world who could do something for her, anything for her.  
在真嗣眼前，只有那个哭泣的小女孩，她发现了悬吊着的母亲，而他是这个世界上唯一能为她做些什么的人，无论做什么都好。

She was starting to shake, wrapping her arms around her chest like she was trying to hide from the boy she had offered herself to.  
她开始颤抖，双臂环抱胸前，仿佛试图从那个她曾献身给的男孩面前躲藏起来。

Shinji finally brought himself up to her slowly, his breathing erratic, those voices and scenes still playing out in his mind, but he needed to help her, he needed to hold her.  
真嗣终于缓缓地走向她，呼吸急促，那些声音和场景仍在脑海中回放，但他需要帮助她，他需要拥抱她。

Because nobody else could.  
因为没人能做到。

"_You actually think you can save me!"_  
“你居然以为你能救得了我！”

A quiet sob escaped her and that was all Shinji needed and he rushed forward, his arms wrapping around her shaking frame, doing his best to convey what he couldn't in words.  
她轻轻啜泣了一声，这正是真嗣所需要的信号，他立刻冲上前去，双臂紧紧环绕着她颤抖的身体，尽其所能用行动传达那些言语无法表达的情感。

"You don't want me..." “你并不需要我……”

Was that a statement or a question? The boy really couldn't tell, but it didn't matter, not when he held her there.  
这是陈述还是疑问？男孩真的无法分辨，但此时此刻，这已无关紧要，因为他正紧紧拥抱着她。

He was shaking too, he was trying his best to suppress it, but the memories made that impossible. Even his heart hammered at his chest like nothing before, that pendent digging into his skin.  
他也在颤抖，竭力压抑着，但那些记忆让他无法控制。甚至他的心跳也前所未有地猛烈撞击着胸膛，那枚吊坠深深嵌入他的皮肤。

Asuka shuffled like she was trying to escape his embrace, he knew she could if she really wanted to, but he wouldn't let her go, not after this.  
明日香像是要挣脱他的怀抱般挪动着，他知道如果她真想离开，她可以做到，但他不会让她走，尤其是在这种时候。

"I do," he reassured her.  
“我会的，”他安慰她。

"Then let me…." "那就让我……"

"No." he cut her off.  
"不行。" 他打断了她。

_He leaned in, he was so desperate, he felt so hollow.  
他倾身向前，如此渴望，感到如此空虚。_

"_Asuka, you're the only one for me."_  
"明日香，你是我唯一的心动。"

He wouldn't, he couldn't, not in her state, not like this, he didn't know or care why she wanted this, why she had offered this to him, but he did know if he let her go now… if he let her walk away thinking that he had rejected her because he didn't want her….  
他不会，他不能，在她这种状态下，不能这样，他不知道也不在乎她为什么想要这样，为什么她会向他提出这样的要求，但他确实知道，如果他现在让她走……如果他让她离开，以为他拒绝她是因为不想要她……

He'd seen what that had done to her… once.  
他曾见过那对她造成的伤害……一次。

"Then why?" she pleaded. "那为什么？" 她恳求道。

He didn't say anything, it felt like hours went by that he just squeezed her frame, but eventually he had to say something.  
他什么也没说，感觉像是过了好几个小时，他只是紧紧拥抱着她，但最终他不得不开口。

"I would… I do… but it's…."  
"我愿意……我确实愿意……但这是……"

"What?" she hissed, there was venom, murderous intent behind that word.  
"什么？" 她嘶声道，那话语中藏着毒液，杀意凛然。

He couldn't say anything.  
他无言以对。

"We could die tomorrow in an Angel attack, why _not_?" she asked again, her voice uneasy.  
"我们明天可能在使徒攻击中丧命，为何不呢？" 她再次问道，声音中带着不安。

_He was lost… 他迷失了…_

"_I wonder if I'll be like Misato when I grow up."_  
“我在想，长大后我会不会变得像美里一样。”

"We're too young, we're…"  
"我们太年轻了，我们……"

"I want…" "我想要……"

"No," he stopped her "I do too, I want that more than you can imagine, but… don't do this… don't do this for me please… just tell me why," he asked.  
"不，"他打断了她，"我也一样，我想要的比你想象的还要多，但是……请不要这样做……不要为了我这样做……告诉我为什么，"他请求道。

Asuka said nothing, even after she stopped shaking, she just pressed up against him like she was trying to melt into the boy, but she didn't wrap her arms around him.  
明日香什么也没说，即使在她停止颤抖后，她只是紧紧地贴着他，仿佛试图融入这个男孩的身体里，但她没有抱住他。

"You're having dinner with Rei…" she said softly.  
"你正和丽共进晚餐……" 她轻声说道。

Shinji just nodded, "I got a letter from her."  
真嗣只是点点头，"我收到了她的信。"

"She likes you." It was a statement, so to the point.  
"她喜欢你。" 这是一个直截了当的陈述。

"We're friends, it'd be hard…"  
"我们是朋友，这会很困难……"

"No idiot, she _likes_ you." she pulled back glaring at him.  
"笨蛋，她喜欢你。" 她退后一步，瞪着他。

He smiled at her, that was what this was about.  
他朝她微笑，这就是问题的关键。

"You think she's going to take me away from you…" it wasn't exactly a question.  
“你以为她会把我从你身边带走……”这话并非完全在提问。

That old Asuka bubbled up again, she pushed at him to get out of her embrace, but for the first time, he didn't let her. He knew she needed to hear this.  
那个老阿斯卡又冒出来了，她推搡着他，想让他离开她的怀抱，但这一次，他没有让步。他知道她需要听到这些。

"If we just did what you wanted… I'd hate myself."  
“如果我们只是按照你想要的去做……我会恨我自己。”

Asuka couldn't believe what he just said, boys his age would be salivating for even a chance to do those things.  
阿斯卡无法相信他刚才说的话，同龄的男孩们哪怕有机会做那些事都会垂涎三尺。

"Why?" she breathed. "为什么？" 她轻声问道。

"Because you're scared." He said simply. "You're scared that Rei is going to take me away from you, aren't you?"  
"因为你害怕。" 他简单地说道。"你害怕丽会把我从你身边夺走，对吧？"

Asuka's eyes watered, but no tears would fall, instead, she thrashed against him, clawing at him to let her go and get back to her room, but he wouldn't let her, he wouldn't let her run away to be alone.  
明日香的眼中泛起泪光，但泪水并未落下，她挣扎着，试图挣脱他的束缚，回到自己的房间，但他不肯放手，他不愿让她独自逃离。

"If I did that, if I let you do what you were just about to, it would be no different from me using you, me…"  
"如果我那样做了，如果我让你做你刚才正要做的事，那和我利用你，我……"

That word floated between them, unsaid.  
那个词在他们之间飘荡，未曾出口。

"I wouldn't have been able to live with myself."  
"我无法原谅自己。"

She stopped, his words ringing in her ears.  
她停下脚步，他的话语在耳边回响。

Shinji loosened his embrace, shuffling, he slowly took his shirt off and put it over her while she was still. It didn't matter if she saw his pendent, right now _she_ was more important.  
真嗣松开了拥抱，挪动着脚步，他缓缓脱下衬衫，轻轻披在她静止的身躯上。此刻，她是否看到他的吊坠已无关紧要，她才是最重要的。

Asuka didn't protest, she let him slip it onto her, her face blank, she didn't embrace him back, she just let those words bounce around inside her head.  
明日香没有反抗，任由他将衬衫套在她身上，面无表情，她没有回抱他，只是任由那些话语在脑海中回荡。

"She's the closest thing I have to a sister, I care that she's healthy, but I couldn't give myself to her."  
"她是我最亲近的人，就像我的妹妹一样，我关心她的健康，但我无法将自己托付给她。"

"Why?" she needed to know, she needed to know why he wouldn't want that girl, why he wanted the broken wreck that was Asuka Shikinami.  
"为什么？" 她需要知道，她需要知道为什么他不要那个女孩，为什么他想要那个支离破碎的式波·明日香·兰格雷。

"Because she's not you." "因为她不是你。"

"Stop." She spat back. "停下。" 她厉声回道。

"Stop what?" "停下什么？"

"Why do you even like me?" she said as she pounded his chest. "She's not like me, she's not broken like me, she would just do everything you wanted like some doll."  
"你到底为什么喜欢我？" 她捶打着他的胸口，"她不像我，她不像我这样支离破碎，她只会像玩偶一样对你言听计从。"

"You're not broken Asuka." He pleaded.  
“你没问题的，明日香。”他恳求道。

"I AM!" she shouted back at him "I can't even make food without hurting you, I can't do anything for you, all I do is hurt you!"  
"我就是！" 她朝他喊道，"我连做饭都会伤害到你，我什么都为你做不了，我只会伤害你！"

_Soryu was seated at the kitchen table.  
Soryu 坐在厨房的餐桌旁。_

"_Then don't come near me. If you do, you'll just end up hurting me."_  
"那就别靠近我。如果你靠近，只会让我受伤。"

"And you think that matters?" he asked quietly.  
"你觉得那很重要吗？" 他平静地问道。

Asuka blinked. 明日香眨了眨眼。

"Asuka… I don't care, I don't care if you hurt me… there's only one thing I…"  
"明日香……我不在乎，我不在乎你是否伤害我……只有一件事我……"

"WHAT?" she asked frantically "What do I have to do for you?!"  
"什么？" 她焦急地问道，"我得为你做什么？！"

Shinji just smiled softly, taking in those bright blue eyes.  
真嗣只是温柔地微笑着，凝视着那双明亮的蓝眼睛。

"Be happy." "要快乐。"

.

.

.

"What?" “什么？”

Shinji pulled back, his hands on her shoulders "I don't want anything else."  
真嗣退后一步，双手搭在她的肩上，“我别无所求。”

It wasn't like he deserved anything at all…  
这并不意味着他理应得到任何东西……

"I want to see you smile, I want to hear you laugh, I want you to _live_ and just be… you."  
"我想看到你微笑，想听到你欢笑，希望你能活着，只是做你自己。"

"You don't want… anything?" she asked, completely incapable of comprehending it "but you cook for me, you help me with me kanji, you don't mock me… you're still a pilot!"  
"你不是想要……什么吗？" 她问道，完全无法理解，"但你为我做饭，帮我学习汉字，从不嘲笑我……你还是个飞行员！"

"What do you mean _still_ a pilot?" he asked, raising an eyebrow.  
"你说的'还是个飞行员'是什么意思？" 他问，扬起眉毛。"

She went quiet, turning away from him "They took Unit-02 from me… Unit-03's the replacement." She said softly.  
她沉默了，转过身去，“他们从我这里夺走了 02 号机……03 号机是替代品。”她轻声说道。

Oh. 哦。

Suddenly everything in Shinji's mind aligned, they took away the one thing that she defined herself by and she was trying to hold onto him, trying to keep him from leaving her.  
突然间，真嗣的脑海中一切变得清晰，他们夺走了她自我定义的那一样东西，而她正试图抓住他，不让他离开自己。

Or at least, she thought he could leave her.  
至少，她以为他可以离开她。

"No one's… just done things for me before. So why?!"  
“从没有人……为我做过这些。为什么？！”

"Why what?" “为什么什么？”

"Why do you like me?!" she asked again.  
“你为什么喜欢我？！”她再次问道。

He stopped, hesitated, what should he tell her? That he was the reason she had died?  
他停下脚步，犹豫了，他该告诉她吗？他是她死去的原因？

No, he got Soryu killed, they were different, weren't they?  
不，是他害死了索留，她们是不一样的，不是吗？

Could he even tell them apart? Of course, he could, but she _was_ still her, wasn't she?  
他真的能分辨出她们吗？当然可以，但她依然是她，不是吗？

It didn't matter. She was here, and she needed his help.  
这并不重要。她在这里，她需要他的帮助。

Shinji wanted to tell her that she was more beautiful than every sunset he had ever witnessed, he wanted to tell her that she was braver than anyone he had ever fought beside, he wanted to tell her that she was the smartest person he had ever known.  
真嗣想告诉她，她比他所见过的任何一次日落都要美丽，他想告诉她，她比他曾并肩作战的任何人都更勇敢，他想告诉她，她是他所认识的最聪明的人。

He wanted to admit to her that he had been in love with her since the moment he saw her. That he could understand her and help her. That he would give her the world if she asked for it and tell her about every good moment they had shared together throughout every single life he'd lived, to share with her every happy memory he had of her, however fleeting.  
他想要向她坦白，自从见到她的那一刻起，他就爱上了她。他能够理解她，帮助她。如果她开口，他愿意把整个世界都给她，并告诉她关于他们共同度过的每一个美好瞬间，无论是在他经历的每一世中，他都愿意与她分享关于她的每一个快乐记忆，哪怕只是转瞬即逝。

Every moment she would never remember.  
每一个她永远不会记得的瞬间。

And then he wanted to beg for her help too. He wanted to ask her to rescue him and care for him and to hold him in the middle of the night when his nightmares came. He wanted her to protect him whenever his demons clawed at him and tell him she forgave him when all those things became too much.  
然后，他也想恳求她的帮助。他想请求她来拯救他，照顾他，在夜半噩梦来袭时拥抱他。他希望每当他的心魔向他袭来时，她能保护他，并在那些事情变得难以承受时告诉他，她原谅了他。

But he didn't deserve that…  
但他不该受到那样的对待……

And it wouldn't be fair to her…  
这对她不公平……

"Because… because…" he stammered.  
"因为……因为……" 他结结巴巴地说。

"Just spit it out already!"  
"快说出来吧！"

"Because you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen!" he shouted finally.  
"因为你是我见过的最美丽的女孩！" 他终于喊了出来。

"Because you can be so alive sometimes, because you make me feel alive, you're so fantastic that… I wish you could see yourself like I see you… and…" he stopped, choosing his next words carefully.  
"因为你有时可以如此充满活力，因为你让我感到充满生机，你是如此的非凡……我希望你能像我看到的那样看待自己……而且……" 他停了下来，小心翼翼地选择接下来的话。

"You remind me of who I was…"  
"你让我想起了曾经的自己……"

Her brow furrowed, "What?".  
她皱起眉头，“什么？”

He closed his eyes "I was… different, a long time ago… I tried to just drown out the world because it was so… painful."  
他闭上眼睛，“我曾……很久以前……我试图只是淹没这个世界，因为它太……痛苦了。”

"_Did you even try to understand?!"_  
“你有没有试着去理解？！”

"_Of course, I tried!"_ “当然，我试过了！”

"but then… I met someone and I failed them… so completely…" he said softly.  
"但后来…我遇到了一个人，我却让他们失望了…如此彻底…"他轻声说道。

He stared into those blue eyes, making sure that each word he said next made it through to her completely. "I don't want to leave you because… no one helped me when I was… was like you."  
他凝视着那双蓝眼睛，确保接下来的每一个字都能完全传达给她。"我不想离开你，因为…在我像你这样的时候，没有人帮助我。"

"_WHY WON'T YOU HELP ME?!"_  
"你为什么不帮我？！"

"_DON'T LEAVE ME ALONE"_ "别丢下我一个人"

"_DON'T ABANDON ME!"_ "别抛弃我！"

"_DON'T KILL ME!"_ "别杀我！"

_The redhead said nothing for the longest of moments, just looking down at him with narrowed eyes.  
红发女孩长久地沉默着，只是眯起眼睛低头看着他。_

"_No."_ "不。"

Those eyes stared back at him, the girl they belonged to incapable of saying anything.  
那双眼睛回望着他，它们的主人女孩却无法说出任何话。

"Let me get another shirt," Shinji said softly, letting go of her, she moved off him as he stood up and went to his dresser. He couldn't have known how her eyes were drawn to that pendent of his chest.  
“让我再拿一件衬衫，”真嗣轻声说道，松开了她，她从他身上移开，他站起来走向自己的抽屉。他不可能知道她的目光是如何被他胸前的那个吊坠所吸引。

As he put on the piece of clothing, he could hear the door open behind him, twisting around, he saw it wide open and her door closing.  
当他穿上那件衣服时，能听到身后门被打开的声音，转过身去，只见门大敞着，而她的房门正缓缓关闭。

ʡʘʘʢ

The girl was in her room again, leaning on her dresser and breathing heavily, she stared at the mirror in front of her as she tried to control her labored breathing.  
女孩再次回到自己的房间，倚靠在梳妆台上，呼吸急促。她盯着面前的镜子，试图控制自己沉重的呼吸。

That shirt he put on her was loose but comfortable. She just looked at herself in the mirror, her heart hammering away in her chest. A wave of exhaustion washed over her at the same time, that adrenaline rush now causing her to crash.  
他给她穿上的那件衬衫宽松而舒适。她只是对着镜子中的自己凝视，心跳如鼓点般在胸腔中敲击。与此同时，一阵疲惫感涌上心头，先前的肾上腺素激增此刻让她感到崩溃。

But there was something else.  
但还有别的东西。

What was this new feeling?  
这种新感觉是什么？

This warmth that she only felt when lying next to him, now she felt it even here in her room.  
这种只有躺在他身边时才感受到的温暖，现在她在自己的房间里也感受到了。

But he rejected her… 但他拒绝了她的请求……

No, he didn't, he rejected what she wanted to do, but he still embraced _her._  
不，他没有，他拒绝了她的意愿，但他依然拥抱着她。

What kind of boy did that? How many boys at school would have done that?  
什么样的男孩会那样做？学校里有多少男孩会那样做？

None of them would, she was certain.  
她确信他们都不会。

What must he think of her now, that she was so pathetic?  
他现在会怎么看她，觉得她如此可怜？

Looking around, she sighed at the mess she had made of her room, not bothering to clean it tended to do that.  
环顾四周，她对着自己房间的一片狼藉叹了口气，懒得打扫自然会变成这样。

Though it wasn't nearly as bad as Shinji's room…  
虽然这远不及真嗣的房间那么糟糕……

She eyed her phone on the dresser and noted the notification on the exterior screen.  
她瞥了一眼梳妆台上的手机，注意到外屏上的通知。

'_One new Message.'_ '一条新消息。'

Flipping the phone open, she read the text from Misato and just smiled.  
她打开手机，读着美里发来的短信，只是微笑。

ʡʘʘʢ

He wouldn't let her run away this time.  
这次他不会让她逃走了。

Shinji slid the door open slowly out of fear of being struck again, only he would get up this time if she did that. Instead of a physical assault, he just saw Asuka sitting there at the side of the bed, a blank look on her face.  
真嗣小心翼翼地推开门，生怕再次被打，但这次如果她动手，他会站起来。出乎意料的是，他没有遭遇身体上的攻击，只看到明日香坐在床边，脸上毫无表情。

He noted that she hadn't changed out of his shirt either.  
他注意到她也没有换掉他的衬衫。

"You must think I'm pathetic." She mumbled, hands in her lap.  
“你一定觉得我很可悲。”她喃喃自语，双手放在膝上。

He walked over in front of her "I don't think that Asuka."  
他走到她面前，“我不认为那是明日香。”

"Then…" She sprung up, surprising him, but he didn't resist when she grabbed his shirt and threw him onto the bed, hands still gripping his shirt.  
“那么……”她突然起身，让他吃了一惊，但她抓住他的衬衫把他摔到床上时，他并未反抗，双手仍紧抓着他的衬衫。

"Promise me you'll never leave me, tell me you'll stay next to me every night, tell me you'll never even think about being with anyone else!"  
"答应我你永远不会离开我，告诉我你每晚都会陪在我身边，告诉我你绝不会考虑和别人在一起！"

That face was contorted, he'd seen it before.  
那张脸扭曲着，他以前见过。

"_Just looking at you makes my blood boil!"_  
“光是看着你就能让我怒火中烧！”

He didn't know what to say, of anything he could have said, nothing came off his lips.  
他不知道该说什么，无论他可能说出什么，都没有一句话从他唇边溜出。

"If I can't have all of you, I don't want any of you!" she barked.  
"如果我不能拥有完整的你，那我宁愿不要你！" 她厉声说道。

His eyes just widened, and his body froze.  
他的眼睛只是睁大了，身体僵住了。

_He was on the train car again, sitting there with that red-orange haze.  
他又回到了那节车厢，坐在那里，周围是那片红橙色的朦胧。_

_Rei was sitting across from him, with Asuka in front of him, leg up on the seat and her leaning over him.  
丽坐在他对面，明日香则在他面前，一条腿搭在座位上，身体前倾靠向他。_

"_Hey, I know you've been jerking off to me, c'mon do it right now, do it right here, I wanna watch you do it."_  
“嘿，我知道你一直在对我意淫，来吧，现在就做，就在这儿做，我想看你做。”

"_Listen to me, if you can't be all mine… then I don't need you!"_  
“听我说，如果你不能完全属于我……那我就不需要你了！”

"Why did you say that?" He whispered.  
"你为什么那么说？" 他低声问道。

"Huh?" “啊？”

Faster than he cared to admit, he grabbed her and flipped her onto the bed with him now over her.  
他迅速得连自己都不愿承认，一把抓住她，将她翻倒在床上，自己则压在她身上。

"Never say that Asuka, don't tell me that, you can take anything from me, take _everything_…" He stopped.  
"永远不要那样说，明日香，别告诉我那样的话，你可以从我这里拿走任何东西，拿走一切……" 他停了下来。

That look she was giving him, that blank stare.  
她投向他的那眼神，那空洞的凝视。

_He was back on that beach, the gentle lapping of the red waves behind him was the only sounds to be heard.  
他又回到了那片海滩，身后红色波浪轻柔的拍打声是唯一能听到的声响。_

_Asuka's left eye and right arm were covered with bandages.  
明日香的左眼和右臂都缠满了绷带。_

_Shinji was on top of her, hands around her neck… squeezing… with tears streaming down his face.  
真嗣压在她身上，双手环绕着她的脖子……紧握着……泪水顺着他的脸颊滑落。_

And a hand reached up to him.  
一只手向他伸了上来。

The moment he felt her hand brush against his face he threw himself off her, facing away, hands grasping his arms and shaking.  
就在她手指轻触他脸颊的那一刻，他猛地从她身上弹开，背对着她，双手紧抓着自己的手臂，颤抖不已。

"Don't think you couldn't ask me for everyt…" he stopped and froze.  
“别以为你不能向我索求一切……”他话音未落，便僵住了。

He felt a slender arm wrap over him. He could tell it was tense, and by the way it moved ever so slowly it was unsure, but eventually it made its way over his waist and the girl push up against his back.  
他感到一条纤细的手臂环绕过来。他能感觉到它的紧张，以及它缓慢移动时的犹豫，但最终它还是越过了他的腰际，女孩紧贴着他的后背。

"Hey… turn back around," She whispered "please…"  
“嘿…转回来，”她低声说，“求你了…”

He wanted to stay like that, away from her, to keep from hurting her again, but… he wouldn't refuse her.  
他本想就这样保持距离，远离她，以免再次伤害她，但是…他无法拒绝她。

So, he did, he rolled over and faced her, faced those bright blue eyes that he'd seen turn lifeless too many times.  
于是，他照做了，翻身面对她，面对那双他曾多次目睹失去光彩的明亮蓝眼睛。

If either of them was broken, he knew it wasn't her.  
如果他们中有谁会崩溃，他知道那不会是她。

"If I can take anything…" She started. "Go to the spring dance with me."  
“如果我能要求什么……”她开口道，“和我一起去参加春季舞会吧。”

His mouth just unhinged at those words, but then a smile grew in its' place. A dance? Asuka _never_ even liked to dance in the first place.  
听到这话，他的下巴几乎要掉下来，但随即一个微笑取而代之。跳舞？明日香原本可从来不喜欢跳舞的。

His answer was instantaneous.  
他的回答即刻而出。

"Yes." "是的。"

She crashed into him, a hushed 'Thank you' reaching his ears as he smiled.  
她猛地撞进他怀里，一声低语的‘谢谢’传入他耳中，他微笑着。

He released his own arms and wrapped them around her, "Do you want to stay here tonight?" he asked her.  
他松开自己的手臂，将它们环绕在她身上，问道：“今晚你想留在这里吗？”

Asuka just nodded to him.  
明日香只是向他点了点头。

Releasing each other, they both adjusted in the actual bed, which Shinji had to admit was much better than how he usually slept. After each grabbed a pillow Asuka let him wrap both his arms around her as she fully pressed up against him, her back to his chest this time, no longer keeping a few inches away.  
他们松开彼此，一起调整到真正的床上，真嗣不得不承认这比他通常的睡眠方式要好得多。两人各自抓了一个枕头后，明日香让他用双臂环抱住她，这次她完全贴在他身上，背对着他的胸膛，不再保持几英寸的距离。

Then she asked a question he hadn't been expecting.  
随后她问了一个他没预料到的问题。

"Tell me about before." "告诉我之前的事。"

"Before what?" "之前什么？"

"Before all this, you said you were different, that you failed someone, and no one helped you." She said softly in the moonlit room.  
"在这一切之前，你说你变了，你辜负了某人，却无人伸出援手。" 她在月光照耀的房间里轻声说道。"

Shinji sighed, he could share this with her, just like Kaji, if only the broad strokes.  
真嗣叹了口气，他可以和她分享这些，就像和加持一样，只要是大致轮廓。

"It was a long time ago, there was this girl… she… hurt like I did, she knew exactly what it was like… to be abandoned." He started.  
“那是很久以前的事了，有个女孩……她……和我一样痛苦，她完全知道那是什么感觉……被抛弃。”他开始说道。

He could feel Asuka tense at the mention of another girl, but he continued.  
他感觉到提到另一个女孩时，明日香紧张起来，但他继续说了下去。

"She just didn't show it, she was so confident, so… larger than life, at least, she seemed that way to me."  
"她只是没有表现出来，她是如此自信，如此…比生活更宏大，至少，她在我看来是这样的。"

"And she hid it well, her pain, she wanted everyone's attention, because she was afraid of not being seen… but deep down… she was just like me."  
"而她隐藏得很好，她的痛苦，她想要每个人的关注，因为她害怕被忽视…但在内心深处…她和我是如此相似。"

"And I wasn't much better, I didn't want to be close to anyone then, I didn't want to have to risk feeling that pain again… and she scared me, she terrified me, because I thought she was everything I wasn't… until it was too late."  
"我也没好到哪里去，那时我不想接近任何人，我不想再次冒险感受那种痛苦…而她让我害怕，她让我恐惧，因为我觉得她拥有我所没有的一切…直到为时已晚。"

He stopped, he should tell her what he told Kaji? He shouldn't change his story, even if it wasn't quite his first life.  
他顿住了，他该告诉她自己对加持说过的那些话吗？他不该改变自己的说法，即便那并非他最初的人生。

"She wanted my help, begged me for my help… without saying a word, and I didn't know any better because I was scared of her. I failed her that first time, I ran from her, but then I came back."  
她需要我的帮助，无声地恳求我…而我当时不知所措，因为害怕她。第一次我辜负了她，逃离了她，但后来我又回来了。

"I tried to help her, but it was so painful, for the both of us, and eventually I thought… maybe… maybe she'd be better off without me, maybe she'd be happier without me, perhaps she'd find some peace with me out of her life."  
我曾试图帮助她，但那对我们俩都太过痛苦，最终我想……或许……没有我，她会过得更好，或许她会因此更快乐，也许她能在我的离开后找到些许安宁。

"So, I told her I couldn't help her, I couldn't help her through her pain…"  
“所以，我告诉她我帮不了她，我无法帮她度过她的痛苦……”

The boy went quiet, not really wanting to continue.  
男孩沉默了，并不真的想继续说下去。

"What happened?" “发生了什么？”

.

.

.

"That night, I walked into the bathroom… there she was… in the tub, swimming in red… it was so red…"  
“那晚，我走进浴室……她就在那里……在浴缸里，沉浸在一片红色中……那红色如此刺眼……”

His fist clenched her shirt, Shinji was sure that his knuckles would be white.  
他的拳头紧抓着她的衬衫，真嗣确信自己的指节都已泛白。

"She was so white, so pale… her cheeks were sunken, but she was still there for a few moments…"  
“她那么苍白，那么憔悴……脸颊凹陷，但有那么一会儿，她还在那里……”

"I didn't know what to do… I just held her… I was covered in red…"  
“我不知道该怎么办……我只是抱着她……我浑身都是血……”

.

.

.

"Did she give you that pendant?" Asuka asked, finally speaking up.  
“她把那吊坠给你了？”明日香终于开口问道。

"Yes," he lied, but what was he supposed to say? "It's a lot like Misato's, right?" That should take care of that idea.  
“是的，”他撒了谎，但他又能怎么说呢？“跟美里那个很像，对吧？”这样应该就能打消那个念头了。

The girl took his hand, but instead of holding it right away, she started tapping into it, the same rhythm he had done for her when teaching her that music.  
女孩握住他的手，但没有立刻握紧，而是开始在他的手上敲击，用的正是他教她那段音乐时的相同节奏。

Shinji smiled to himself, those unpleasant thoughts washed away by the simple gesture.  
真嗣对自己微微一笑，那些不快的思绪被这个简单的动作冲刷掉了。

"It's not your fault." She said softly, echoing his own words.  
“这不是你的错。”她轻声说道，重复着他自己的话。

He held his tears back, he didn't dare to say anything to her, because if he started, he knew he might not stop.  
他强忍住泪水，不敢对她吐露半句，因为他知道，一旦开口，可能就停不下来了。

"Did you hear me? It's not your fault, idiot."  
"你听到我说的了吗？这不是你的错，傻瓜。"

How little she knew. 她对此一无所知。

"I heard you." He said quietly.  
"我听到了。" 他轻声说道。

She didn't know how wrong she was, she didn't know a fraction of the things he had done, but somehow, hearing her say that…  
她不知道自己错得有多离谱，她对他所做的一切知之甚少，但不知为何，听到她这么说……

"Promise me something." He said suddenly, stopping her tapping and taking her hand into his, to his enjoyment she didn't pull away, she accepted and intertwined her own fingers with his.  
“答应我一件事。”他突然说道，止住了她的轻敲，将她的手握入自己手中，令他欣慰的是，她没有抽回，反而接受了，并用自己的手指与他交缠。

"If something happens, if I'm taken from you, or…"  
“如果发生什么事，如果我离开你，或者……”

"Stop!" she hissed at him, "I don't want to hear it!"  
"住口！" 她低声对他喝道，"我不想听！"

He smiled at her outburst.  
他对她的爆发报以微笑。

"Will you do it for me?"  
"你能为我做这件事吗？"

She said nothing, so he continued.  
她一言不发，于是他继续说了下去。

"If something happens, if I can't come back to you, I want you to promise me something."  
"如果发生什么事情，如果我无法回到你身边，我希望你能答应我一件事。"

"What?" she growled. "什么？" 她咆哮道。

"Move on." He said softly. "You need to find someone…"  
"继续前进。" 他轻声说。"你需要找到一个人……"

"Who? Who the hell could I find idiot?! No one would understand!"  
"谁？我他妈能找到哪个白痴？！没人会理解的！"

Then she got quiet, "Not like you do..."  
然后她安静下来，“不像你那样……”

He nodded, even though she couldn't see him, "You're right, no one would understand, no one would be worthy of you either, but that doesn't mean they can't try, it doesn't mean they can't try to understand and that's what I want you to promise."  
他点点头，尽管她看不见他，“你说得对，没人能理解，也没人配得上你，但这并不意味着他们不能尝试，并不意味着他们不能试着去理解，这就是我希望你承诺的。”

"It's hard trusting people, and most of the time it ends poorly, but when it doesn't it's too amazing to describe, but there's something else." he said, leaning in closer.  
“信任人很难，大多数时候结果都不尽如人意，但当结果并非如此时，那种美好难以言表，不过还有别的东西。”他说着，更靠近了一些。

"Promise me you won't catch yourself hating that redhead in the mirror… be happy… and if you can't do it for yourself, try to do it for me." He whispered into her ear.  
“答应我，别让自己对着镜子憎恨那个红发女孩……要快乐……如果不能为自己，那就试着为我这么做。”他在她耳边低语。

For a moment she said nothing, and Shinji was sure that she wouldn't, but instead of a sarcastic comment or another fiery rebuttal, all that escaped her was a small sigh.  
有那么一会儿，她什么也没说，真嗣确信她不会开口了，但出乎意料的是，她没有说出尖酸刻薄的话或再次激烈反驳，只是轻轻叹了口气。

"Alright… I promise" “好吧……我保证。”

"Thank you." He said, finally letting his head rest on his pillow with the bundle of red hair next to him.  
“谢谢你。”他说着，终于让自己的头枕在枕头上，身边是一团红色的头发。

He felt so warm. 他感到如此温暖。

Though, in the back of his mind, he almost felt guilty for making her promise him that. When he couldn't even do the same thing for himself.  
尽管，在他心底深处，他几乎为自己让她许下那个承诺而感到内疚。当他甚至无法为自己做到同样的事情时。

ʡʘʘʢ

Asuka woke up early, it was going to be a long day after all.  
明日香早早醒来，毕竟今天将会是漫长的一天。

Rolling out of Shinji's arms and the covers slowly, she looked back at the boy who had whisked her nightmares away from her, who had kept her from doing something that now she believed she would have regretted.  
她缓缓从真嗣的怀抱和被窝中滚出，回头看着那个将她的噩梦驱散的男孩，那个阻止了她去做现在她认为会后悔的事情的人。

His face was calm, and his mouth was hovering open just slightly.  
他的面容平静，嘴巴微微张开，悬停在那儿。

The boy twitched, she expected him to open his eyes at the sudden lack of warmth, but he didn't, instead, he shook, his dreams seemingly coming for him.  
男孩抽搐了一下，她以为他会因为突然失去温暖而睁开眼睛，但他没有，反而颤抖起来，梦境似乎正向他袭来。

Asuka frowned at the idea he could save her from her own dreams, but she couldn't do a damn thing for the boy when his own came for him.  
明日香对这个想法皱起了眉头，他能在她的梦中拯救她，但当男孩自己的噩梦来临时，她却无能为力。

One day she would do the same for him. She would save him from those nightmares.  
总有一天，她也会为他做同样的事。她会从那些噩梦中拯救他。

Her body seemed to move on its own, leaning in, their faces growing closer, soon her lips were less than an inch from his.  
她的身体似乎自行其是，向前倾去，他们的脸庞越来越近，很快她的唇离他的不到一英寸。

"S... Soryu**"** he breathed in his sleep softly, but it was loud enough.  
"S... 索鲁" 他在睡梦中轻声呢喃，但声音足够响亮。

Asuka blinked. 明日香眨了眨眼。

Soryu? 索鲁？

He trembled again; his face scrunched up.  
他又颤抖起来；脸庞紧皱。

"Don't…" "不要…"

Her mind worked overtime despite her grogginess.  
尽管她昏昏沉沉，思绪却异常活跃。

Soryu? 索琉？

That girl he had told her about…  
他曾向她提起的那个女孩……

Were those the nightmares he had been having, ones of the girl he had confessed to her about?  
那些是他一直做的噩梦吗，关于他向她坦白过的那个女孩的梦？

She leaned in and closed to his ear.  
她靠近了些，贴近他的耳朵。

"I'm… sorry." He mumbled in his sleep.  
“我……对不起。”他在睡梦中喃喃道。

She couldn't remember another time he had apologized. To her or anyone else, it was jarring enough that she was sent back, just watching him now begin to calm in his sleep, his breathing beginning to steady out.  
她记不清他还有哪次曾向她或任何人道过歉。这突如其来的举动让她不禁退缩，只是看着他现在开始在睡梦中平静下来，呼吸逐渐平稳。

Asuka leaned in again, "It's alright Shinji." She whispered to him.  
明日香再次靠近，“没事的，真嗣。”她轻声对他说。

She shook her head, there would be time for that later, she would make him tell her, hopefully that would give him dreamless nights.  
她摇了摇头，这事可以稍后再谈，她会让他告诉她的，希望这能让他拥有无梦的夜晚。

Just like he had for her.  
正如他为她所做的那样。

That time she thought of wouldn't come for a very, very long time.  
她所想的那一刻，还要很久很久才会到来。

**Alright, pitchforks down people, give me a chance to explain myself if the story didn't already.  
好了，大家放下干草叉，给我个机会解释，如果故事还没说清楚的话。**

**Shikinami loses the thing that she defines her life by, but she still has that comfort blanket in Shinji, yet she knows Rei feels 'warm and content' with him after the elevator talk, and Shikinami literally says 'that means you love him, so she sees Rei as being able to take Shinji away, because she herself still isn't 100% sure about her own feelings. She hasn't done anything for Shinji, so when Rei is doing something for him, Shikinami's mentality is, 'well I've never done anything for him, so why would he want to stay if Rei is giving him something'. Shikinami sees this as a competition because she knows nothing about relationships.  
式失去了定义她生活的那个东西，但她还有真嗣这个安慰剂，然而她知道在与真嗣的电梯谈话后，丽感到‘温暖和满足’，式实际上说‘这意味着你爱他’，所以她认为丽能够把真嗣带走，因为她自己对她的感情还不是百分之百确定。她没有为真嗣做过任何事，所以当丽为真嗣做些什么时，式的想法是，‘我从未为他做过什么，如果丽给他些什么，他为什么要留在我身边’。式把这看作一场竞争，因为她对恋爱一无所知。**

**Soryu might do this out of her false sense of maturity, as she tried to with Kaji, Shikinami would do this also from her false sense of maturity, but with the perceived 'competition' from Rei, she sees it as a way to keep Shinji with her.  
惣流可能是出于她虚假的成熟感而这样做，就像她试图与加持那样，式也会出于她虚假的成熟感这样做，但由于感受到来自丽的‘竞争’，她认为这是留住真嗣的一种方式。**

**But that idea is coming from a misunderstanding that love is something that is given with the expectation of something in return, her growing up as an orphan can't even comprehend that. Soryu had her mother, Shiki had no one.  
但这种想法源于对爱的误解，认为爱是有期望回报的，她作为孤儿的成长经历甚至无法理解这一点。惣流有她的母亲，式则一无所有。**

**I don't think that Soryu would act exactly like this, instead during that first night when Shinji rolls over and puts his arm around her, Soryu MIGHT have run away, more likely she would have hit him then left or not, that's a 50/50. Soryu probably wouldn't have pulled back when he said 'stop', and probably wouldn't have been left shaking, she'd probably rage at him for a bit, though Shinji would basically have done the same thing, hold her in an embrace even if she became more violent than Shikinami. And that's all assuming she didn't beat Rei to death in the elevator when she talks with her.  
我认为惣流不会做出这样的举动，相反，在那个初夜，当真嗣翻身搂住她时，惣流可能会逃跑，更有可能的是她会揍他一顿然后离开，或者不离开，这概率各占一半。当他说“停下”时，惣流大概不会退缩，也不会因此颤抖，她可能会对他发一阵脾气，尽管真嗣基本上也会做同样的事，即使她变得比渚薰更暴力，他也会紧紧抱住她。这一切的前提是，假设她在电梯里与绫波交谈时没有把她打死。**

**Now for poor Shinji… Shinji's obviously horrified and with his guilt/shame from NGE/EOE he has to reject her, but instantly reassuring her that he does in fact care for her, that it's not her that he's saying no to, it's the idea that she thinks she needs to do something like that to make him stay with her.  
现在轮到可怜的 Shinji 了…… Shinji 显然被吓坏了，加上他从《新世纪福音战士》（NGE）和《真心为你》（EOE）中的罪恶感和羞耻感，他不得不拒绝她，但立刻安慰她，告诉她他确实在乎她，他拒绝的不是她，而是她认为自己需要做那样的事来让他留在她身边的想法。**

**Perhaps the saddest thing to me is that he can't even be that intimate with her, kissing? Only brings back his first kiss. Seeing her bare? Shame from the hospital. Sure, he can be around her, he can hold her, but to be physically intimate with her on any level above that just brings back trauma. All the while I'm sure Asuka (Soryu or Shikinami) would crave physical affection.  
对我来说，最悲哀的是他甚至无法与她亲密接触，亲吻？只会让他回想起初吻。看到她赤裸？医院的羞耻感又涌上心头。当然，他可以陪在她身边，可以拥抱她，但要与她在任何高于这个层次的肉体上亲密接触，只会唤起创伤。与此同时，我相信 Asuka（Soryu 或 Shikinami）会渴望身体上的爱抚。**

**Thank you for coming to my TED talk lol and yes, I've purposefully been saving Shinji's iconic line for that moment.  
感谢大家来听我的 TED 演讲，哈哈，是的，我有意留着 Shinji 那句标志性的台词，准备在那一刻说出来。**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – Yeah it just kinda comes out of nowhere in 2.0, I suppose we're supposed to infer that it's because of her digging into Unit-04s accident?  
美利坚超旋风 – 是啊，这东西在 2.0 里突然冒出来，我想我们应该是要推断这是因为她深入调查了 4 号机的事故？**

**EvaPilotFair – That Ritsuko/Shinji moment was a memory from a previous life, sorry about that.  
Eva 飞行员公平 – 那个律子/真嗣的瞬间是前世的记忆，对此感到抱歉。**

**Su Exodus – Yeah that's a memory, unfortunately, the first life where Shinji gets to see Soryu following him around.  
苏醒的出埃及记 – 没错，那是段记忆，遗憾的是，这是真嗣第一次看到副班长跟踪他的那一世。**

**skyf0x – I thought the whole "I don't see anybody" when asked is a cliché, but apparently, my story has a lot in common with Re-take, now I must read it!  
skyf0x – 我原以为被问到“我没看到任何人”这种回答很老套，但显然，我的故事与《Re-take》有很多相似之处，现在我必须去读一读了！**

**A Guy – Shinji as Gordon Ramsay? Hmmm… As for how many lives, well you'll get a number, but yeah remember a lot of them he doesn't even make it to the full length of NGE, so even judging how much time it's taken is hard.  
A Guy – 真嗣变成戈登·拉姆齐？嗯……至于有多少条命，你会得到一个数字，但确实，很多情况下他甚至活不到《EVA》全篇结束，所以连判断时间花了多少都很难。**

**calborghete – Thanks! Asuka really could use some cooking lessons from Shinji…  
calborghete – 谢谢！明日香真的该向真嗣学学做饭了……**

**Berix – Actually Shinji has not seen Asuka actually cook before, so no he hasn't had to reset after insulting it lol. Really Shinji should have tried one more time, but he's kinda going off Soryu experience, when he should have gone in and talked with her, instead of walking away to let her 'cool off'.  
实际上，真嗣从未亲眼见过明日香下厨，所以自然没有因为嘲讽她的厨艺而被迫重置的经历了，哈哈。说真的，真嗣本该再尝试一次的，但他却基于对惣流过往的印象，选择了离开让她“冷静一下”，而不是走进去与她交流。**

**GeHirNunDherZ – *Vietnam Flashbacks Intensify* Especially with this chapter. Thanks! Hope you enjoy the future.  
GeHirNunDherZ —— *越南闪回加剧* 特别是有了这个chapter。谢谢！希望你喜欢未来。**

**Alright, folks, it's that time in the semester, so don't expect a chapter for another week or two, you got a nice 5k+ this week so it should keep you till then haha! Of course, this is coming from someone who will probably just upload anyways.  
好了，各位，学期中这个时段到了，所以别指望下周或再下周会有新章节，这周你们有超过 5 万字的内容，应该够撑到那时候了哈哈！当然，这话出自一个可能还是会随时上传新内容的人。**

**Until Next Time. 下次再会。**


### Chapter 27: "…And night after night, we pretend it's alright…"  
Chapter 27: "…夜复一夜，我们假装一切安然无恙…"

Shinji groaned as he opened his eyes to the empty room. He _really_ didn't want to get up today.  
真嗣呻吟着睁开双眼，面对空荡荡的房间。他今天真的不想起床。

Sitting up in bed the Third Children remarked at how good his back felt after sleeping on an actual bed.  
坐在床上，第三适格者感叹着在真正的床上睡觉后背部感觉有多好。

Rubbing his eyes, he looked around for his nightly companion, but to no avail. The boy stretched, even with that full night of sleep he felt tired, even after only a night of mild terrors, he hoped he hadn't woken Asuka up with them.  
他揉了揉眼睛，四处寻找他的夜间伴侣，却一无所获。男孩伸了个懒腰，尽管睡了一整夜，他仍感到疲惫，即便只是经历了轻微的噩梦，他希望没有因此吵醒明日香。

Pushing himself to the side of the bed, his eyes instantly spotted the small note on the bedstand. Leaning over to it he picked it up and read it over.  
他将自己推到床边，眼睛立刻瞥见了床头柜上的小纸条。他俯身过去拿起纸条，仔细阅读了一遍。

'_Shinji, I went with Misato today, we'll be back late, but we should talk tonight, I think we both need that.'_  
'真嗣，我今天和美里一起出去，我们会晚点回来，但今晚我们应该谈谈，我想我们都需要这样。'

Why would she go with Misato?  
她为什么要和美里一起去？

Unit-03… 三号机…

Shinji's mind raced and for the briefest of moments, Shinji's heart rate accelerated, until he remembered what she had said last night.  
真嗣的思绪飞速运转，有那么一瞬间，他的心跳加速，直到他想起了她昨晚说的话。

"…_you're still a pilot."_ “……你还是个驾驶员。”

He could only imagine how Asuka would have reacted in the moment, to her Evangelion being taken away. Perhaps Misato just took the girl with her to see Unit-03's activation, a small gesture to keep the Evangelions in her life.  
他只能想象，如果换成是明日香，在那一刻她的 EVA 被夺走，她会有何反应。或许美里只是带她去看三号机的启动，一个小小的举动，让 EVA 继续留在她的生活中。

It wasn't like Asuka could be piloting Unit-03, even if she were still a pilot, there's no way she'd be able to sync with it.  
不像明日香还能驾驶三号机，即便她仍是驾驶员，也不可能与它同步。

Shinji shook his head, there was no need to worry, even if it was dangerous for her to be near the initial activation, the risk involved was minor at best and no more than when she actually faced Bariel while piloting Unit-02.  
真嗣摇了摇头，无需担心，即使她靠近初次启动有危险，风险也微乎其微，不会比她驾驶二号机面对巴力时更大。

Instead, he drifted to the other matter, if Misato was personally going there, it had to be activating today.  
相反，他转念想到另一件事，如果美里亲自前往，那必定是今天就要启动了。

That meant he would face Unit-03 alone, no Asuka in Unit-02, and Rei unable to pilot the damaged Unit-00.  
这意味着他将独自面对三号机，二号机中的明日香不在，而绫波因受损的零号机无法驾驶。

He'd be all alone. 他将孤身一人。

But that was alright, he could do it… couldn't he?  
但没关系，他能做到……不是吗？

There was no need to worry about it right now, instead, Shinji set the note back down as he stood up and stretched some more before quietly made his way to the door.  
现在没有必要担心这个，相反，真嗣将纸条放回原处，站起身来又伸了个懒腰，然后悄悄地走向门口。

Sliding it open slowly, he peeked out just in case Misato was still here, he called out to either of the girls to see if one of them was still in the apartment for some reason, but he was only met with silence, or at least that was what anyone else would have heard.  
他慢慢地推开门，探头出去看看美里是否还在，他呼唤着两个女孩，想看看是否有人因为某种原因还在公寓里，但他只遇到了沉默，或者至少是其他人会听到的沉默。

"_They're not here dummkopf,"_  
“他们不在这儿，傻瓜，”

_There she was, lounging at the kitchen table, her legs up on the table and hands folded in her lap.  
她就在那儿，懒洋洋地靠在餐桌旁，双腿搭在桌面上，双手交叠放在腿上。_

Sighing, Shinji, tried to ignore the specter and went about preparing himself toast for the morning.  
叹了口气，真嗣试图忽视那幽灵，自顾自地准备着早餐的吐司。

"_You're getting quite the show this time around," She commented, "first the shower, then your field trip, and now last night?" she counted it out on her fingers._  
“这次你可真是大饱眼福了，”她评论道，“先是淋浴，然后是实地考察，现在又是昨晚？”她一边说一边掰着手指头数着。

"_Did you enjoy it as much as the first time?"_  
"你这次享受的程度和第一次一样吗？"

Shinji refused to turn around, he refused to rise to the bait; he should've known that she'd want words about what had transpired last night.  
真嗣拒绝转身，他拒绝上钩；他早该知道她会想谈论昨晚发生的事情。

Had she been watching? The idea of that made his skin crawl, though it wasn't like he could hide anything from her anyways.  
她一直在观察吗？这个念头让他浑身发毛，尽管他也没法在她面前隐藏什么。

"_She really is nothing like me Third, since when did any one of my look-alikes throw themselves at you like_ that_? She's not even really a look-alike."_  
她真的和我一点都不像，老三，什么时候我的任何一个长相相似者会那样扑向你？她甚至算不上是个长相相似者。

"None of them did," He admitted, taking his food, and sitting down across from her, "but she did it for herself, not for me."  
"他们都没有，" 他承认道，拿起食物，坐在她对面，"但她是为了自己，不是为了我。"

"_So… you're just going to 'help' her like all the others hmm?"_  
"所以……你就像其他人一样，只是‘帮助’她，嗯？"

"I want to." He said softly, taking a bite of his food.  
"我想这么做。" 他轻声说道，咬了一口食物。"

"_You know baka Shinji, I've been trying to help_ you _this whole time, but you can't seem to stay away from them, can you?"_  
"你知道吗，笨蛋真嗣，我一直都在试图帮你，但你似乎就是离不开他们，对吧？"

He looked at her, he looked at those wrappings, hiding the wounds he caused…  
他看着她，目光落在那些包裹着伤口的绷带上，那些伤口是他造成的……

"No… I can't… because I owe it to you." Even to himself, he sounded so pathetic, so dejected.  
"不……我不能……因为我欠你的。" 即使对自己，他也听起来如此可怜，如此沮丧。

_She sat up in her seat, that eye narrowing "Don't pin this on me, you're the one who's doing it out of guilt."  
她坐直了身子，那只眼睛眯了起来，“别把这事儿推到我头上，你才是出于内疚才这么做的。”_

He threw up his hands "Alright, would you like me to just ignore her, ignore you?! I think we found out how well that goes! So, tell me what you want!" He was fed up with this, he just spent the night keeping a version of her from going through something he knew she would regret and now his invisible companion was seemingly saying he shouldn't have!  
他双手一摊，“好吧，你是想让我无视她，还是无视你？！我们不是已经见识过那样做的后果了吗！所以，告诉我你到底想要什么！”他对这一切已经厌烦透顶，昨晚他才费尽心思阻止了一个版本的她去做一件他知道她会后悔的事，现在这个看不见的同伴却似乎在说他不该这么做！

Out of the corner of his eye, Shinji spotted a certain warm water penguin peek out from his home to see what all the noise was about. However, Pen Pen just shut the door again at the sight of only the Third Children seated there.  
眼角余光中，真嗣瞥见一只温暖的温水企鹅从它的窝里探出头来，想看看外面为何如此吵闹。然而，看到只有第三适格者坐在那里，Pen Pen 又把门关上了。

_Asuka said nothing, just looked at the boy, not breaking their staring contest.  
明日香一言不发，只是盯着那个男孩，毫不退让地继续着他们的对视比赛。_

"Every time I see her, every time I see _you_, I remember how you all but begged me to help you, so why shouldn't I do it now Asuka?!" he wanted to know, he wanted to know why she didn't want him to save her. "Why should I help her?"  
“每次我见到她，每次我见到你，我都会想起你是如何几乎恳求我帮助你的，那为什么我现在不应该帮明日香呢？！”他想知道，他想知道为什么她不希望他救她。“我为什么要帮她？”

"_Because you don't love her, you don't love any of them!" she yelled back at him._  
“因为你不爱她，你谁也不爱！”她朝他吼了回去。

"IT'S NOT ABOUT ME!" He roared, his hand slamming down over his heart. "I… I don't care if I do or don't… I don't care Asuka… as long as she's happy that's what matters!"  
"这根本不是关于我！" 他咆哮着，手掌猛地拍在心口上。"我……我不在乎我是否……我不在乎明日香……只要她幸福，那才是最重要的！"

"Don't you get it…" he mumbled, deflating in that moment, "I don't deserve anything…"  
"你还不明白吗……" 他喃喃自语，那一刻仿佛泄了气，"我不配拥有任何东西……"

"_You're at least right about that." she sneered._  
"你至少说对了一点。" 她冷笑着。

_Soryu stood up and made her way to the other side of the table, her face leaning in towards his own.  
惣流站起身，走向桌子的另一边，她的脸朝他凑近。_

With her… there was nothing, no flashes of a previous life, no panic attacks, nothing, not when even when she was this close.  
和她在一起……什么都没有，没有前世的闪回，没有恐慌发作，什么都没有，即使她靠得这么近。

Because she wasn't really there.  
因为她并不真的在那里。

She _couldn't_ really be there.  
她不可能真的在那里。

Could she? 是吗？

"_You're mine Third, you'll always be mine," She growled leaning in even further, "because I'm the only one who you can't run from!"_  
“你是我的第三，你永远都是我的，”她咆哮着，身体更加前倾，“因为我是你唯一无法逃离的人！”

He could almost feel her breath on his face, just like he had with Shikinami last night, but it was just a fleeting shadow of a memory.  
他几乎能感觉到她的呼吸拂在脸上，就像昨晚与式波那样，但那只是一段转瞬即逝的记忆残影。

"_Promise them they can have all of you, tell them they can take_ everything _from you, but we both know that you'll never be able to give it to them, not when I'm here, not when you'll remember what you did to me for the rest of your life, besides… you told me all those things first."_  
“承诺他们可以拥有你的全部，告诉他们可以从你那里夺走一切，但我们俩都清楚，你永远无法给予他们，尤其是有我在，尤其是你将终生铭记对我所做的一切，再说了……那些话是你先对我说的。”

"_You told me I could have all of you."_  
“你说过我可以拥有你的全部。”

"No, I didn't." “不，我没有。”

"_Oh, really?"_ “哦，真的吗？”

_She pulled away from the boy, now sitting down on the table in front of him just beyond his meal, that same old cocky grin on her lips.  
她从男孩身边抽身，此刻正坐在他面前的桌上，就在他餐盘的另一侧，唇边挂着那抹熟悉的得意笑容。_

He always hated that grin.  
他一直讨厌那抹笑容。

The Third Children just narrowed his eyes "Hit me."  
第三适格者只是眯起了眼睛，“打我。”

_She just raised her eyebrow at that comment, "What?"  
她对这个评论只是挑了挑眉，“什么？”_

"I said, hit me… like you used to." He said calmly.  
“我说，打我……就像你以前那样。”他平静地说。

_The phantom said nothing, she didn't raise her hand either, they both knew exactly where this was going.  
幽灵没有说话，她也没有举起手，他们俩都清楚这一切将走向何方。_

Shinji smiled sadly; they both knew why he asked that.  
真嗣苦涩地笑了笑；他们俩都知道他为何这么问。

Reaching out his hand, he just pushed it through her abdomen. Fighting the reflex of actually touching something, nothing resisted him, there was nothing really there after all.  
他伸出手，只是穿过了她的腹部。强忍着真正触碰到什么的本能反应，没有任何阻力，毕竟那里什么都没有。

"If you could hit me, I'd apologize Asuka, but I can't hold you, I can't be there for you like I can be there for someone real."  
"如果我能被你打中，我会向你道歉的，明日香，但我无法拥抱你，无法像对待真人那样陪伴你。"

"_You can see me idiot."_ _she countered with a hushed tone, "You can_ see _me."_  
"你能看见我，傻瓜。" 她用低沉的声音反驳道，"你能看见我。"

Shinji nodded "I can, but I'm the crazy one, aren't I?" he asked her.  
真嗣点点头，"我能看见你，但我才是那个疯子，对吧？" 他问她。

"I'm Shinji Ikari, Third Children, Pilot of Evangelion Unit-01," the boy said in that almost robotic tone, "and I failed you, I hurt you, but I can help _her_ Asuka, don't you want me to help her?"  
"我是碇真嗣，第三适格者，EVA 初号机的驾驶员，"男孩用那种近乎机械的语调说道，"我让你失望了，我伤害了你，但我能帮助她，明日香，你不想让我帮她吗？"

"_Oh, like you helped the one you were talking about last night?"_  
"哦，就像你昨晚提到的那个人一样？"

Shinji froze, that life… how it had changed everything, how he had taken so long to recover from it, and the consequences from it.  
真嗣僵住了，那段生活……它如何改变了所有一切，他花了多长时间才从中恢复过来，以及它带来的后果。

Well, he was looking right at the consequence…  
嗯，他正直视着后果……

"_That was one bad day huh?" she said with a sickly smile, "I don't think I ever asked before, but which was worse, what you did to me or what you did to her?"_  
“那真是糟糕的一天，对吧？”她带着病态的微笑说道，“我想我之前没问过，但哪个更糟，你对我做的事，还是你对她做的事？”

"_Which day was worse?"_ “哪一天更糟糕？”

_That… was her going nuclear.  
那……是她彻底爆发了。_

The Third Children closed his eyes, wanting to just try and ignore her and like a thousand times before, it didn't work.  
第三适格者闭上了眼睛，试图像之前无数次那样忽略她，但这次同样没有奏效。

"_Which was worse Shinji? When you let me die or when you purposefully pushed her away… pushed her to the edge?"_  
“哪个更糟糕呢，真嗣？是你让我死去，还是你故意推开她……将她逼到绝境？”

"That's not what I wanted." He said, his voice uneasy, his body shaking slightly.  
"那不是我想要的。" 他说，声音不安，身体微微颤抖。

"_Oh, but it's what happened." She said still with that smile, "Face it, I'm the only one for you, you're stuck with me… besides, I know everything about you."_  
"哦，但这就是发生的事。" 她依然带着那抹微笑，"面对现实吧，我是你唯一的选择，你甩不掉我……再说了，我对你了如指掌。"

"_Do you really think they could forgive you, accept you if they knew what you did, do you think they would approve of you?"_  
"你真的认为他们会原谅你，接受你如果他们知道你做了什么，你认为他们会赞同你吗？"

"Do you think…," he asked opening his eyes, he shouldn't say this, but he couldn't stop the words from leaving his lips, "your mother would approve of this?"  
"你觉得……" 他睁开眼睛问道，虽然知道不该说，但话还是脱口而出，"你妈妈会同意这件事吗？"

That… was him going nuclear.  
那……是他彻底爆发了。

_Now it was her turn to shake, though mostly in anger at the mention of her mother.  
现在轮到她颤抖了，尽管主要是对提到她母亲感到愤怒。_

"Do you think Kyoko would like you being miserable and angry at everyone?" he asked, he knew he shouldn't be saying those words, but a part of him felt good to hurt her back for once.  
"你觉得 Kyoko 会喜欢你痛苦和生每个人的气吗？" 他问道，他知道自己不该说这些话，但有一部分的他感到一丝快意，终于能让她也尝尝被伤害的滋味。

And that made him feel sick.  
这让他感到恶心。

Standing up, Shinji met her face to face, "How do you think she would feel if she knew you tried to take the easy way out like her?" He growled, remembering how she had run away, how they had found her in that ruined building, just lying in that bathtub.  
站起身来，真嗣与她面对面，“你觉得如果她知道你像她一样试图逃避现实，她会怎么想？”他咆哮道，回想起她如何逃离，他们如何在那个废墟建筑里找到她，就那样躺在浴缸中。

How she had given up on life.  
她如何放弃了生活。

" 'There's no reason for me to live', isn't that what you said?" he asked.  
" '我没有活下去的理由', 这不是你说的吗？" 他问道。

_The girl pulled into herself, seemingly slinking away from him "That's rich, especially coming from you." She said quietly, averting her eyes.  
女孩似乎缩成一团，像是要从他身边溜走，"这话说得真讽刺，尤其是出自你之口。" 她轻声说道，避开了他的目光。_

"_Idiot…"_ "笨蛋…"

That tone, he knew that tone, it was the one he had heard in her voice when she wanted to cry, when she wanted to finally show some emotion, though it rarely ever came.  
那个语气，他熟悉那个语气，那是她在想要哭泣时，想要终于表现出一些情感时的声音，尽管这种情况极为罕见。

_Hikari was in front of him again.  
光再次站在他面前。_

"_You just made a girl cry, go after her!"_  
你刚刚把一个女孩弄哭了，快去追她！

He wanted to come up with a witty retort, thinking about every piece of her life he could bring up to twist that knife just a bit more, not that she wouldn't do the same right after that.  
他本想回以一句机智的反驳，思索着能提及她生活中的每一个片段，只为将那把刀再扭深一点，尽管她随后也会如法炮制。

They could hurt each other so well, couldn't they?  
他们能如此巧妙地互相伤害，不是吗？

They knew how to maim and tear away at each other like rabid dogs.  
他们懂得如何像狂犬般互相伤害，撕裂对方。

Wasn't it enough for their own lives, their own two screwed up lives, to have ripped away so many pieces already?  
难道他们自己的生活，这两个一团糟的生活，还不够已经撕裂了这么多碎片吗？

And it all just hit the boy so suddenly, how this had escalated, how they had gone for each other's throats so quickly, why? Why did they have to hurt each other so much?  
这一切突然间击中了男孩，这一切是如何升级的，他们是如何迅速地互相攻击，为什么？为什么他们必须如此深深地伤害对方？

He couldn't do it. 他做不到。

He just could do it anymore.  
他再也做不下去了。

He was so damn tired.  
他真是累坏了。

"What are we doing Asuka?" he asked, collapsing into his seat again, that exhaustion taking him over, and his hand coming up over his face like he was trying to hide from her, "Are we just going to be gut each other over and over like this forever?"  
“我们在做什么，明日香？”他问道，再次瘫坐在座位上，疲惫感席卷而来，手捂住脸，仿佛试图从她面前躲藏起来，“我们难道要这样一次又一次地互相伤害，永远这样下去吗？”

_The redhead remained silent, not looking at him. That moment seemed to drag on forever, seconds stretching into hours. Until she finally broke it.  
红发女子保持沉默，没有看向他。那一刻仿佛被无限拉长，秒针的跳动似乎变成了小时的流逝。直到她终于打破了沉默。_

"_Did you mean it?" she asked quietly._  
“你是认真的吗？”她轻声问道。

"What I just said?" he asked, a bit of shame creeping into his voice.  
“我刚才说的那些？”他问道，声音中透出一丝羞愧。

"_No… last night, what you wanted to say to her… did you mean it?" she asked, those blue eyes watering, "How you were in love with me the first time we met and all that?"_  
"不…昨晚，你想对她说的那些话…你是认真的吗？" 她问道，那双蓝眼睛泛起了泪光，"你第一次见面就爱上了我，还有那些话？"

Shinji stared at those blue eyes and only one thing came to his mind.  
真嗣凝视着那双蓝眼睛，心中只浮现出一个念头。

Why? 为什么？

Why did she care if that was true or not? It wasn't like it would do her any good.  
她为什么在乎这是真是假？这又不会对她有任何好处。

He nodded "It was all true, everything."  
他点头道：“全是真的，一切都是。”

"_Really?" she whispered, before getting up and walking away._  
“真的吗？”她低声说，随即起身走开了。

The dark-haired boy just looked down at his half-eaten toast and shook his head.  
黑发男孩只是低头看着他那半块吃剩的吐司，摇了摇头。

His appetite gone, he stood up and emptied his plate into the garbage, hopefully, Rei's cooking was good enough to fill his stomach after school.  
食欲全无的他站起身，将盘子里的食物倒进垃圾桶，只盼望放学后零的厨艺足够好，能填饱他的肚子。

Returning to his room to gather up all his things for school, he eyed the SDAT player currently on his dresser. Why wasn't it tucked in the drawer?  
回到房间收拾上学所需的一切，他的目光落在了梳妆台上那台 SDAT 播放器上。为何它没有被收进抽屉里？

Shrugging he picked it up and put it in his backpack, if Soryu decided to come after him today he would rather drown her out with it than make a scene.  
他耸了耸肩，将它捡起放入背包，如果今天 Soryu 决定来找他麻烦，他宁愿用它来淹没她的声音，也不愿引起骚动。

Calling a goodbye to Pen Pen he walked out the apartment door, the idea that he might not return didn't even cross his mind.  
向 Pen Pen 道别后，他走出了公寓门，他甚至没有想过自己可能不会回来。

**Su Exodus – Hits the spot, doesn't it?  
苏逃亡记 – 正中红心，不是吗？**

**Berix – Maybe Shinji just needs a good therapeutic shouting match with a certain invisible redhead about how they really failed each other? Hmmm? I look forward to the day you can't find any grammar errors lol.  
贝里克斯 – 也许真嗣只是需要和一个特定的隐形红发人进行一场激烈的 therapy 式对吼，探讨他们是如何真正地辜负了彼此？嗯？我期待着那一天你找不到任何语法错误，哈哈。**

**TalonEmpire – Thanks! Hopefully, I can get it to transcend a few more times lol.  
TalonEmpire – 谢谢！希望它能再超越几次，哈哈。**

**K4153r – As for the moment you're talking about? I don't know if you're referring to the memory of her trying to get with Kaji in NGE or when she's on top of Shinji in the EOE 'pre-instrumentality' scene where she says "Just looking at you makes my blood boil", but either way we got flashbacks to both.  
K4153r – 你提到的那一刻？我不确定你是指她在 NGE 中试图接近加持的记忆，还是她在 EOE 的“前器用性”场景中骑在真嗣身上说“光是看着你就让我血脉贲张”的那一幕，但无论如何，我们都回想起了这两段。**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – Thanks a lot, I'll do my best!  
UltraSpink of Da USA – 非常感谢，我会尽力的！**

**Luciano- Thank you, glad you enjoyed it!  
Luciano- 谢谢，很高兴你喜欢！**

**RandomRelapseFan – Thank you! Deep down I think Shinji's really the same scared kid from NGE who killed the world, granted he's much braver and adapted to his situation, but it's still classic Shinji who bubbles up from time to time.  
RandomRelapseFan – 谢谢！内心深处，我认为真嗣仍然是那个从《新世纪福音战士》中毁灭世界的胆小鬼，尽管他现在勇敢得多，也适应了环境，但经典的真嗣还是会时不时冒出来。**

**dyinglittelstar – Thanks!

jimothy – 真嗣谈论一个他推开的版本的明日香，这在第三次冲击后的《新世纪福音战士》中并未出现。相反，这是另一个生活，我们将有机会看到这段记忆，**

**A Guy – Shinji having a crisis over Shikinami not being Soryu? I can't say that's a good thing, particularly because he's consumed by guilt, he should probably be thinking more about it. Re-take again… hmmm I'm going to have to read that one day.  
A Guy – 真嗣因为式波不是惣流而陷入危机？我不能说这是件好事，特别是因为他被愧疚所吞噬，他或许应该更多地思考这个问题。《Re-take》再读一遍……嗯，我有一天得去读读。**

**guest – You'll have to read and find you *Insert evil laughter*

**spartanman2 – Thank you! As for Soryu caring about Shinji's fragile mind and only knowing how to attack… *looks back up at chapter with sheepish face*. I'll admit, I didn't know what Steins Gate was until I looked it up, kinda like Thrice Upon a Time the book?  
spartanman2 – 谢谢！至于惣流关心真嗣脆弱的心灵，只知道如何攻击……*尴尬地抬头看向chapter*。我承认，我之前并不知道《命运石之门》是什么，直到我查了一下，有点像《三度穿越时空》那本书？**

好吧，下周我可能会再给你们带来一篇《chapter》，但不是在周三，毕竟要期末考试了，所以接下来的一周左右我都会很惨，我真的是在需要休息、脑子一片浆糊的时候写下这个的，所以如果有看起来不对劲的地方，请见谅哈哈。**

**Until Next Time! 下次再见！**


### Chapter 28: "…Happy ever after, please stay for a while…"  
Chapter 28: "…愿幸福永驻，请稍留片刻…"

Misato looked over at the German while they continued through the convoy of military vehicles and heavy equipment.  
美里一边继续穿过军车和重型装备的车队，一边瞥向那位德国人。

Asuka had been silent the whole time, resorting to nods or one-word answers whenever she asked her something. She had been looking out the window the entire drive, but now she had her phone open, seemingly listening to a voicemail.  
明日香一直沉默不语，每当问她什么时，她只是点头或用单字回答。整个车程中，她一直望着窗外，但现在她打开了手机，似乎在听语音留言。

From the moment Misato saw the girl she had known something was off. She had found her this morning, ready to go with her things packed earlier than her, granted the older woman was sporting a light hangover, but still, she was typically fighting the redhead for the bathroom every morning.  
从看到那个女孩的那一刻起，美里就觉得有些不对劲。她今早发现她已经准备好了，行李比自己还早打包，虽然自己有点轻微宿醉，但通常她每天早上都会和红发女孩争抢浴室。

Glancing over again, something else had intrigued her, the girl didn't have her signature A-10 clips in. Granted Unit-02 was now in storage and Unit-03 would use different ones, but there hadn't been a day when the girl had left the apartment without them.  
再次瞥了一眼，美里注意到了另一件事，女孩没有戴她标志性的 A-10 发夹。虽然二号机现在已存放在仓库，三号机使用的是不同的发夹，但女孩从未有一天不戴它们就离开公寓。

Misato smiled to herself, perhaps the girl was finally looking to get out of her comfort zone. Or trying a new hairstyle to attract some boy.  
美里暗自微笑，或许这女孩终于想要走出她的舒适区了。或是尝试新发型来吸引某个男孩。

Asuka seemed frustrated, taking the phone from her ear and looking at it, Misato heard the unmistakable voice of Rei.  
明日香显得有些沮丧，从耳边拿下手机并看着它，美里听到了丽那 unmistakable 的声音。

"Thank you." "谢谢。"

What the Colonel didn't expect was the girl to frown and put the phone away.  
上校没料到的是，女孩皱起眉头，把手机收了起来。

"What an idiot, I'm not doing this for her." She mumbled, just loud enough for the woman to hear.  
"真是个傻瓜，我这么做可不是为了她。" 她咕哝着，声音刚好能让那女人听见。

Misato couldn't figure out what was going on with the girl, she simply went back to staring out the window, not saying a word.  
美里搞不懂这女孩是怎么回事，她只是回到窗边继续凝视窗外，一言不发。

"We should be ready sometime this afternoon Asuka." Finally speaking up, Misato pulled her eyes back to the road, not that she needed to be cautious with all this traffic.  
"我们今天下午应该就能准备好了，明日香。" 美里终于开口了，她将视线从窗外拉回到路上，尽管在这稀疏的车流中并不需要太过小心。

"I really am thankful for you doing this. The paperwork's a bit messy, but hopefully, we can get you officially under our jurisdiction instead of dealing with Europe."  
"我真的非常感谢你这么做。文件工作有点乱，但希望我们能让你正式归入我们的管辖，而不是和欧洲那边打交道。"

Once again, the girl said nothing, instead just peering out the window. Misato frowned, she would have expected the redhead to be chomping at the bit to get back in an Evangelion. The girl had thrown such a fuss over Unit-02's storage that she'd expect her to show some sort of emotion.  
女孩再次一言不发，只是凝视着窗外。美里皱起眉头，她本以为红发女孩会迫不及待地想回到 EVA 里。女孩对二号机的存放如此大闹一场，她本以为她会表现出某种情绪。

ʡʘʘʢ

Misato yawned, even with the massive amount of coffee she had ingested she was still tired. After all, it wasn't coffee from Ritsuko's coffee maker, so it wasn't the same.  
美里打了个哈欠，尽管她喝了一大堆咖啡，还是感到疲惫。毕竟，这不是来自律子咖啡机的咖啡，所以感觉不一样。

Speaking of the good doctor, Misato looked at the time, it was mid-afternoon and after a whole day of preparations, Ritsuko should be landing down soon.  
提到那位好医生，美里看了看时间，已是午后时分，经过一整天的准备，律子应该很快就要降落了。

A flurry of callouts were buzzing all arounder her, but only one really had her attention.  
四周响起了此起彼伏的呼喊声，但真正引起她注意的只有一个。

"Begin countdown." The colonel commanded, not nearly with enough authority in her tone as she would've liked.  
“开始倒计时。”上校下令道，语气中却远没有她希望的那般威严。

"_Beginning countdown. All ground crew to evacuate. Medical examinations of test pilot complete. The pilot is currently on standby in the mobile isolation room."_  
"开始倒计时。所有地面人员撤离。试飞员的体检已完成。飞行员目前在移动隔离室内待命。"

"Looks like I can leave the rest to Ritsuko now..." she sighed, looking around for a chair to catch a quick nap in. it was unprofessional she knew, but it would be an hour or two before they really started the test.  
"看来我可以把剩下的交给律子了..." 她叹了口气，环顾四周寻找一把椅子想打个盹。她知道这不太专业，但测试真正开始还要一两个小时。"

Eyeing a particularly inviting chair in the corner of the cramped bunker, Misato made a move towards it right as she felt her phone go off in her pocket.  
目光落在狭小避难所角落里一张格外诱人的椅子上，Misato 正要朝它走去，忽然感觉到口袋里的手机震动起来。

The thought of a quick nap being stripped from her made her irritation flare, but the id on her phone quickly washed it away.  
想到小憩的念头被剥夺，她的烦躁感顿时升起，但手机上显示的来电 ID 很快驱散了这份不快。

"A secure line, from Asuka?"  
“一条加密线路，来自 Asuka？”

Stepping out into the open-air Misato's eyes drifted to the towering humanoid in the distance, cranes and construction equipment rose into the sky around it. She opened her phone, this time with a smile.  
踏出户外，Misato 的目光飘向远方那高耸的人形身影，起重机和建筑设备在其周围直插云霄。她打开手机，这次带着微笑。

"What's up Asuka, you need a pep talk?"  
"怎么了，明日香，需要打打气吗？"

The colonel watched as grounds crews scurried around her, military vehicles were parked everywhere in an effort to move away from Unit-03. One mass exodus from around the black Evangelion.  
上校注视着地勤人员在她周围忙碌穿梭，军用车辆四处停放，试图远离 03 号单位。一场从黑色福音机周围的大撤离。

"I just suddenly felt like talking for some reason…" she heard the girl from the other side. No doubt still on her way up to the entry plug.  
“我只是突然觉得想聊点什么……”她听到另一边的女孩说。毫无疑问，她还在前往插入栓的路上。

"Sure, and like I said I appreciate you for doing this, thanks again."  
“当然，就像我说的，我很感激你这么做，再次感谢。”

The distinctive sound of a plug suit sealing rang through the phone, the woman guessed she was getting herself ready, the reason why they couldn't have put a room at the top of the structure escaped her, but the idea of her getting ready in essentially a small suspended tram car wasn't a reality she wished on herself.  
电话那头传来了紧身衣密封的独特声响，女子猜测她正在为自己做准备。为何他们不能在建筑顶层安排一个房间，这让她困惑不解，但想象她在本质上宛如一节悬空缆车的小空间里准备，这并非她愿意面对的现实。

"I'm sure you could've ordered me to do this if you wanted." There was nothing hostile in that voice, but Misato wasn't expecting such a neutral answer, she expected the girl to be grateful.  
"我确信如果你愿意，完全可以命令我这么做。" 那声音中没有敌意，但美里没想到会得到如此中性的回答，她本以为女孩会感激涕零。

For a moment there was nothing on the line, Misato knew the girl long enough to know there was something on her mind.  
有那么一会儿，电话那头一片寂静，美里对这女孩足够了解，知道她心里一定有事。

The question was, what exactly?  
问题是，究竟是什么呢？

"Are you really torn up about missing Rei's dinner party?"  
"你真的因为错过了丽举办的晚餐聚会而感到难过吗？"

"No… dinner parties aren't my thing; besides it's exhausting to act like you're having fun while you're not. Have you ever had to do that before?"  
"不……晚餐聚会不是我的菜；而且假装自己玩得很开心其实很累。你以前有过这样的经历吗？"

"Yeah, I have Asuka…" "是的，我有过，明日香……"

"Do you think Shinji acts like that a lot?"  
"你觉得真嗣经常那样吗？"

"I don't think I should be talking for him, but how often do you have to do that Asuka? How often do you pretend to have fun?" It wasn't like the girl usually looked like she was having fun in the first place, just her attitude while living together made that clear.  
""我不该替他说话，但你有必要那么频繁吗，明日香？你又有多常假装自己很开心呢？"" 毕竟，女孩平时看起来就不像是会开心的人，光是同居时的态度就足以说明这一点。

.

.

.

"You know Shinji's a lot better at this than you," Asuka responded quietly, it was probably supposed to be under her breath but it was picked up by her phone.  
""你知道真嗣在这方面比你强多了，"" 明日香轻声回应，本意可能是低语，但被手机捕捉到了。

Well, that was a surprise.  
哎呀，这真是出乎意料。

"Oh, Shinji's better at what?" she said slyly into the phone.  
“哦，真嗣在哪方面更厉害？”她狡黠地对着电话说。

Misato was willing to bet that Asuka had her hands over her mouth trying to take back the words before a dejected sigh came over the phone.  
美里愿意打赌，明日香正用手捂着嘴，试图在电话那头传来一声沮丧的叹息之前收回那些话。

"He's… he's a good person to talk to."  
"他……是个很好的倾诉对象。"

Asuka, talking with someone? Talking _to_ someone_?_ That was ridiculous.  
明日香，和别人交谈？向别人倾诉？这太荒谬了。

Even more, ridiculous was the idea that it was Shinji who was doing the listening.  
更荒谬的是，居然是真嗣在倾听。

Then it hit her. 然后她恍然大悟。

"Oh, really?" Misato asked with a smirk, starting to pace in front of the bunker. Perhaps the two of them had been becoming rather close, perhaps the 'harmonizing' had worked a little too well.  
"哦，真的吗？" 美里带着一丝戏谑问道，开始在掩体前踱步。或许他们俩已经变得相当亲近，或许这种'调和'进行得有点过头了。

"He's, a lot like me you know?" Misato could almost imagine the slight grin on the redhead's face in her mind's eye.  
"他，你知道的，很像我吧？" 美里几乎能想象到红发女子脸上那抹淡淡的微笑，仿佛就在她眼前。

"Shinji? you're joking." "真嗣？你在开玩笑吧。"

"No, really, he _gets_ me." That voice she was hearing, it was so sure of itself like she had the utmost confidence in the boy.  
“不，真的，他懂我。”她听到的那个声音，如此自信满满，仿佛她对那个男孩有着绝对的信任。

Perhaps something more than just talking had occurred.  
或许发生了不仅仅是交谈的事情。

The thought of her two teenage wards being alone for more and more time as she got swamped in work crept its way into her mind. That age, those hormones, Misato frowned, she needed to sit them down if she thought this could go further.  
随着工作越来越忙，她两个十几岁的被监护人独自相处的时间越来越多，这个念头悄然爬上心头。那个年纪，那些荷尔蒙，Misato 皱眉，如果她认为这可能会进一步发展，她需要坐下来和他们谈谈。

How could she have missed this? The memory of catching Asuka red-handed as she tried to cook rushed back to her, and she mentally kicked herself for not seeing more signs.  
她怎么可能忽略了这一点？回想起当场抓住 Asuka 试图做饭的情景，她在心里责备自己没有注意到更多的迹象。

But Rei's dinner party… 但丽举办的晚餐派对……

If Asuka wasn't annoyed that the other girl was having Shinji essentially all to herself, that meant she was incredibly confident that he wouldn't leave her. That he felt the same way.  
如果明日香没有因为另一个女孩几乎独占了真嗣而感到恼火，那意味着她极其自信真嗣不会离开她。他也有同样的感觉。

Of course, she could also be confident in her ability to bring him to the edge of death if he did leave her for Rei.  
当然，她也可能自信于如果真嗣真的为了丽离开她，她有能力把他逼到生死边缘。

"Hmm, you should have seen him before you got here." She mused, the idea of that quiet boy she had picked up all those months ago sweeping the redhead off her feet was just too much to comprehend.  
“嗯，你本该在他来之前见见他的。”她沉思着，那个几个月前她带回家的安静男孩竟能让红发女孩如此倾心，这想法让她难以置信。

Maybe this was what the two kids needed.  
或许这正是两个孩子所需要的。

"What do you mean?" “你什么意思？”

"Did Shinji ever tell you what he was like before NERV?" the Colonel didn't know if it was her place to tell her this, but it couldn't hurt.  
"真嗣有没有告诉过你他在 NERV 之前是什么样的？" 上校不确定这是否是她该透露的，但应该无伤大雅。

"A bit, he was sparse on the details though," Misato noted the hesitation in her voice at first, was there something she didn't want her to know?  
“有点，不过他细节上说得不多，”美里一开始就注意到了她声音中的迟疑，是不是有什么她不想让她知道的事情？

"When I picked him up, he was the most introverted boy you'd ever seen." She recalled with a smile, remembering the kid who could barely talk to her, yet whose eye's blazed with amazement at the sight of the GeoFront.  
“当我接他时，他是我见过的最内向的男孩。”她微笑着回忆道，想起那个几乎不敢和她说话的孩子，但他的眼睛在看到地底都市时却闪烁着惊奇的光芒。

"He was just quiet, and he was always listening to that music player too, it never seemed to leave him." The Misato frowned "After the Sixth Angel… he just seemed more alive."  
“他只是很安静，而且总是听着那个音乐播放器，它似乎从未离开过他。”美里皱起眉头，“在第六使徒之后……他似乎变得更加有生气了。”

"It's hard to imagine Shinji being so timid." Asuka mused, "He's just so… real, I've never had time for phony friends, but Shinji… he sees _me_, he sees the real me somehow without even trying. I thought before all I had was the EVA, but…" her voice stopped.  
"很难想象真嗣会如此胆怯。" 明日香沉思着，"他就是这样……真实，我从未有时间去交那些虚伪的朋友，但真嗣……他看到了我，他以某种方式看到了真实的我，甚至没有刻意去尝试。我曾以为我只有 EVA，但是……" 她的声音停了下来。

"Asuka?" Misato asked, wondering why the girl had stopped talking.  
"明日香？" 美里问道，好奇为什么女孩停止了说话。

"Do you have anyone like that Misato? Someone who just listens to you and makes you feel warm?"  
"美里，你有这样的人吗？一个只是倾听你，让你感到温暖的人？"

Misato's eyes widened, Asuka wasn't just close to him, she had _those_ kinds of feelings for him.  
美里瞪大了眼睛，明日香不仅仅是与他亲近，她对他有着那样的感情。

Oh, she was defiantly going to have to sit the two of them down tonight to have a little talk.  
哦，她今晚肯定得把他们俩叫到一起，好好谈谈。

Clearing her voice Misato composed herself despite the fact the girl wouldn't even be able to see her "I… do Asuka, I do have someone like that."  
清了清嗓子，美里尽管知道女孩根本看不到她，还是整理了一下自己的情绪，"我……是的，明日香，我确实有那样的人。"

Kaji, her mind drifted to the man. The one who she had just laid in bed with for a whole week and between doing more… physical activities… she remembered how they had talked.  
加治，她的思绪飘向了那个男人。那个她刚刚与他同床共枕了一整周的人，在那些更为……身体力行的活动间隙，她记得他们是如何交谈的。

How she had shared her feelings of confusion and rage against her father to him and how he had shared his greatest failure, how he betrayed his brother, to her.  
她向他倾诉了对自己父亲的困惑与愤怒，而他则向她坦白了自己最大的失败，如何背叛了他的兄弟。

In a way, it was a more intimate experience than anything they did with their bodies that week.  
某种程度上，这比那一周他们身体上的任何接触都更为亲密。

"And what's that like? How does that even work?"  
那是什么感觉？那究竟是怎么运作的？

"What do you mean?" “你什么意思？”

.

.

.

"I've… never done this before, I've never _had_ this before."  
“我……从未做过这个，从未有过这样的经历。”

Asuka admitting she's unsure of herself? Asuka asking to talk to her, one on one? Misato smiled to herself, perhaps no matter how much NERV and the Angels stripped from them, teenagers would always be teenagers.  
明日香承认她对自己不确定？明日香要求单独和她谈谈？美里暗自微笑，也许无论 NERV 和使徒从他们身上夺走多少，青少年永远都是青少年。

Now Misato would be put in an unfamiliar situation. How the hell was she supposed to talk to her about this? She had been catatonic from the Second Impact when she was Asuka's age.  
现在美里将面临一个陌生的情境。她到底该怎么和明日香谈这件事呢？她在明日香这个年纪时，因为第二次冲击而陷入了木僵状态。

"Then how about after this we talk about it, we can go get steak instead of that slop they have at the cafeteria in the GeoFront."  
“那我们待会儿再谈这个，我们可以去吃牛排，而不是地底都市食堂里的那些糟粕。”

"That'd be nice… thank you Misato."  
"那会很好……谢谢你，美里。"

The colonel smiled to herself, perhaps there was still hope that all of them could live a normal life eventually.  
上校暗自微笑，或许他们最终都有希望过上正常的生活。

Including herself. 包括她自己。

ʡʘʘʢ

There in her plug suit, Asuka just stared at herself in the mirror.  
穿着插入栓服的明日香只是盯着镜子中的自己。

She didn't recognize that girl in the mirror, the girl that talked to people so openly, that craved the warmth given to her by sleeping next to her favorite idiot, the face that seemed more interested in getting back to Shinji tonight to talk instead of piloting this new Evangelion.  
她认不出镜中的那个女孩，那个与人如此坦诚交谈的女孩，那个渴望睡在心爱的傻瓜身边所给予的温暖，那个今晚似乎更想回到真嗣身边聊聊而非驾驶这台新福音战士的面孔。

What was it that had changed so fast?  
是什么变化得如此之快？

Had she always been like this? Did she just push this down inside her and somehow Idiot Shinji had found a way to pull it to the surface?  
她一直都是这样吗？她是不是只是把这一切压抑在心底，而不知怎的，笨蛋真嗣找到了一种方法将其引出水面？

Of course, that's what happened, but did she want this?  
当然，事情就是这样，但她真的想要这样吗？

That same part of her that had been dominant for so long, that part of her that had protected her, that had driven her, whispered that everything was a trap, that she didn't need Shinji or Misato, that she was perfectly well off on her own.  
那个长期以来一直占据主导地位的部分，那个保护她、驱使她的部分，低语着一切都是陷阱，她不需要真嗣或美里，她一个人完全可以过得很好。

That same part of her that had her run from Shinji the night after the Eight Angel, that had made her leave the first warmth she had felt from the boy.  
就在那一晚，她逃离了真嗣，那个让她在第八使徒事件后夜奔的部分，也是让她离开了从男孩身上感受到的第一份温暖的原因。

Shinji. 真嗣。

The thought of the dark-haired boy's arms wrapping around her was all she needed to push that part of her down, she wrangled it, silenced its lying mouth, and tossed it aside.  
只要想到那个黑发男孩的臂膀环绕着她，就足以让她压制住那部分自我，她与之搏斗，封住了它那说谎的嘴，将其抛诸脑后。

Asuka Langely Shikinami would not let it rule her again, not when for the first time, she had something more than just the EVA, not when she found herself able to sleep a dreamless sleep every time he wrapped his arm around her.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷不会让它再次主宰自己，尤其是当她第一次拥有了比 EVA 更重要的东西，每当他拥她入怀，她都能无梦地安然入睡。

Asuka Langely Shikinami loved Shinji Ikari.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷深爱着碇真嗣。

That was the truth she hadn't been ready to tell herself, the truth she hadn't been ready to admit to herself.  
那是她尚未准备好面对的真相，是她一直不愿承认的事实。

The lips of the girl in the mirror began to curl until a small smile sprouted in place of the normal scowl she so often wore.  
镜中女孩的嘴角开始上扬，一个小小的微笑取代了她平日里常挂的怒容。

When was the last time she smiled, _truly_ smiled out of true happiness?  
她上一次发自内心地微笑，究竟是什么时候？

Perhaps this was the first time.  
或许这是第一次。

Gathering up all her belongings, she tossed them all into the duffle bag she had brought them in. Looking down at the doll that had found itself with her, the girl's gaze lingered on it for a moment, remembering that woman who gave it to her.  
她收拾好所有物品，将它们一股脑儿塞进带来的运动包里。低头看着那个不知何时来到她身边的玩偶，女孩的目光在它身上停留了一会儿，想起了那位送她玩偶的女士。

She should track her down and thank her for it if she ever went back to Germany.  
如果她有机会回到德国，应该找到她，感谢她的这份礼物。

Zipping up the bag, the cable car finally found itself coming to a stop at the top of the structure housing Unit-03.  
拉上背包拉链，缆车终于缓缓停在了容纳零三号机体的建筑顶端。

All personal had started to leave the immediate area as soon as she had entered and Asuka wasn't surprised to simply see the entry plug open and waiting for her.  
所有人员在她进入后便开始迅速离开现场，明日香并不意外地看到插入栓敞开着，仿佛在等待她的到来。

After stowing her belongings, the redhead took a deep breath and climbed inside, an anxious feeling that she hadn't gotten since the first time she had entered Unit-02 bubbled up in her stomach, but she forced it down. The image of her going back to the apartment, laying down next to Shinji, and just talking motivating her.  
安置好个人物品后，红发少女深吸一口气，爬进了插入栓。那种自首次进入零二号机体以来未曾有过的紧张感在胃里翻腾，但她强压下去。脑海中浮现出回到公寓，躺在真嗣身边，与他交谈的画面，这激励着她。

She barely noticed the rising LCL as it washed over her, there was nothing new in the entry plug, all controls were the same, and as the familiar flash of multiple colors ran over the view in front of her, she couldn't help but realize how beautiful the view was.  
她几乎没注意到 LCL 液体的上升，任由它淹没自己，插入栓内的一切都毫无新意，所有控制装置依旧如故。当眼前熟悉的五彩光芒闪烁而过时，她不禁意识到这景象有多么美丽。

Asuka ignored the callouts ringing over the comms, the technical readouts, and other jargon that didn't mean anything. She just looked out over those green mountains, thinking about how Shinji would react to the view from the Austrian Alps.  
明日香无视了通讯中传来的呼叫声、技术读数以及其他毫无意义的术语。她只是凝视着那些苍翠的山峦，思索着真嗣会对奥地利阿尔卑斯山的景色有何反应。

Then she heard that noise for the first time.  
然后她第一次听到了那个声音。

That horrible noise that sounded like a mix of metal being crushed and ripped apart, a mass of deep pulsing red filled the initial part of her view, only to spread, its growth was in intervals, starting and stopping, until it filled everything in sight.  
那可怕的声音，像是金属被碾碎和撕裂的混合，一片深红色的脉动充斥了她视野的初始部分，随即蔓延开来，其扩张断断续续，开始与停止交替，直至填满了视线所及的一切。

At first, she thought it was a technical glitch, some system error until the feeling of weightlessness took her.  
起初，她以为这只是技术故障，某个系统错误，直到失重感袭来。

It was as if she wasn't in the seat anymore, it just disappeared, as pink crosses began to flow towards her, passing her.  
仿佛她已不再坐在座位上，座位消失了，粉红色的十字形符号开始向她涌来，穿过她。

She looked around, grasped around for any controls to press the emergency eject, but there was nothing, it was as if there had been nothing here in the first place.  
她环顾四周，试图寻找任何可以按下紧急弹射的控制器，但什么也没有，仿佛这里从一开始就空无一物。

Then there was the laughter.  
随后是那笑声。

The childish feminine laughter that filled her ears, and it didn't sound like just one source, it sounded like dozens of children laughing softly.  
那充满她耳中的稚嫩女童笑声，听起来不只一个来源，仿佛是数十个孩子在轻声嬉笑。

Her back suddenly became cold as she was pushed forwards, looking behind her all that was visible were two plumes of what looked like pink gas, propelling her forwards.  
她的背部突然感到一阵寒意，被推向前方，回头望去，只见两股看似粉红色的气体，推动着她前进。

Looking back in front of her, the red turned to blue, as a massive cross with rings around it began to grow bigger, or she was just being pushed closer, it was hard to tell.  
她抬头望向前方，红色逐渐转为蓝色，一个巨大的带环十字开始变得越来越大，或者说她正被推向更近的地方，难以分辨。

All she could do was watch as she went further one last thing escaping her mouth before colliding with whatever was beyond.  
她只能眼睁睁地看着自己越陷越深，在撞上未知之物前，最后一句话脱口而出。

"Help me… Shinji." "救救我…真嗣。"

**Two Seconds to Midnight… 午夜前两秒…**

**You know throughout this whole story I've been really wanting to ask you guys this, it's been so interesting to me (well for all time travel stories) that we all know where things are going, you know, I know, and it's like watching a train wreck in slow motion while knowing it's going to happen. So, I've actually felt guilty, because I've given the characters just that bit more light and happiness than they otherwise received, and now like Shinji thought to himself, the other foot had dropped.  
你知道吗，在整个故事中，我一直很想问你们这个问题，对我来说（其实对所有时间旅行故事都是如此），我们都知道事情的走向，你知道，我也知道，就像在慢动作中观看一场火车失事，同时知道它即将发生。所以，我确实感到内疚，因为我给了角色们比他们原本得到的更多一点的光明和幸福，而现在就像真嗣自己所想的那样，另一只鞋子已经落地了。**

**SHOUTOUTS! 特别鸣谢！**

**SwaggySpoon – Well… sorry about this….  
SwaggySpoon – 嗯... 对此感到抱歉...**

**Bwanagator – I'll never tell… at least not now, but get some more tissues ready.  
Bwanagator – 我绝不会说... 至少现在不会，但准备好更多的纸巾吧。**

**Su Exodus – Oh, you have no idea what we got in store.  
Su Exodus – 哦，你完全不知道我们准备了什么。**

**UltraSpink of Da USA - Thanks, I'm trying haha.  
美国超旋风 - 谢谢，我正在努力哈哈。**

**Greg242 – Warm up or shut down?  
Greg242 – 热身还是关机？**

**BigBlueSmile11 – Thank you, there are times when even Shinji snaps back, though no matter how justified he'll always feel guilty, or should in my mind.  
大蓝微笑 11 – 谢谢，有时候连真嗣也会反击，尽管无论多么有理由，他总会感到内疚，或者在我看来应该感到内疚。**

**skyf0x – No we haven't seen what happened to Soryu, but trust me, we will get that. The ending has been decided, and I doubt it will change much, but I think most will find it acceptable.  
skyf0x – 不，我们还没看到索留的情况，但相信我，我们会搞清楚的。结局已经定下，我怀疑不会有太大变动，但我认为大多数人会接受。**

**EvaPilotFair – Thanks!  EvaPilotFair – 感谢！**

**Guest – Oh, we're gonna keep that going lol.  
Guest – 哦，我们会继续保持这种状态，哈哈。**

**Calborghete – Thank you! Calborghete – 谢谢！**

**Berix – One thing that bothered me with the rebuilds is that souls in the cores don't seem to matter outside Unit-01 so I'm assuming NGE rules only apply to Unit-01** _**shrug.**_ **I would say (if you found the right song) that you shouldn't look at the music video, instead look at the album and the story from it. Happy hunting. And Shinji will get a chance to sample some of our bluenette's food, next chapter of course.**  
贝里克斯——重建版中让我困扰的一点是，核心中的灵魂似乎只在零一号机之外无关紧要，所以我猜《新世纪福音战士》规则仅适用于零一号机。如果找到了合适的歌曲，我建议你不要看音乐视频，而是关注专辑及其背后的故事。祝你寻觅愉快。当然，下次chapter时，真嗣将有机会品尝我们这位蓝发少女的美食。

**jimothy – Here's to hoping we get to see more Soryu in the future.  
吉米 – 希望未来我们能看到更多惣流的身影。**

**A Guy - *Sigh* No I have not read Re-Take mostly because I didn't know about it before this and I stick to this site, but now given how many times its been mentioned I have to read it lol. I thought the whole 'I don't see X' was a cliché, apparently not. Yes, we'll get a memory of that night.  
某人 - *叹气* 没有，我之前没读过《重来》，主要是因为之前不知道它的存在，而且我一直只关注这个网站，但现在既然它被提到了这么多次，我得去读读看了，哈哈。我以为那种‘我没看到 X’的情节已经老套了，显然并非如此。是的，我们会回忆起那个夜晚的。**

**GeHirNunDherZ – Haha, thanks.  
GeHirNunDherZ – 哈哈，谢谢。**

**Hoodiebud – Hopefully we keep it that way!  
Hoodiebud – 希望我们能一直保持这样！**

**Alright, next time we get a nice sit-down with our favorite family, or at least one bluenette, a time traveler, and a dick, so let's have some fun before we get our hearts ripped out? Think Shinji will ask Gendo about Yui's cooking? I'm looking forwards to it.  
好了，下次我们能和最喜欢的家族，或者至少是一个蓝发、一个时间旅行者和一个混蛋坐下来好好聊聊，趁我们的心还没被撕碎之前找点乐子吧？你觉得真嗣会问源堂关于唯的厨艺吗？我可是期待得很呢。**

**Until Next Time. 下次再会。**


### Chapter 29: "Father they have written…"  
Chapter 29: "父亲，他们已经写下了……"

"So, you're having dinner with Rei hmm?" Kensuke looked over to the boy relaxing on the grass. "Think that's the best idea? You know, for your health."  
"所以，你要和丽共进晚餐，嗯？" Kensuke 瞥了一眼那个在草地上放松的男孩。"你觉得这是个好主意吗？你知道，为了你的健康。"

Shinji knew exactly what he was talking about, but even if Shikinami would have beaten him senseless, he doubted she would reach the levels Soryu could have.  
真嗣清楚自己在说什么，但即便式波会把他打得半死，他也怀疑她能否达到绫波那种程度。

Not that he doubted she wouldn't be able to.  
并非他怀疑她做不到。

"Asuka was invited too." Shinji chuckled "We even talked about it, Rei isn't someone I'd…"  
“明日香也被邀请了。”真嗣轻笑道，“我们甚至还讨论过，丽不是我会……”

"Woah, calm down there Shinji, jeez I'm just teasing," then a smirk grew on his face. "Speaking of the red demon and ice queen, where is everyone anyway?"  
"哇哦，冷静点，真嗣，我只是开个玩笑，" 然后他的脸上露出了狡黠的笑容。"说到红发恶魔和冰山女王，大家现在都在哪儿呢？"

Unsurprisingly, when the majority of his friend group was absent, it was extremely quiet, not that Kensuke wasn't good company, but with Rei, Asuka, and Toji all missing, it felt almost… empty.  
不出所料，当他的大部分朋友都不在时，周围异常安静，尽管健介是个不错的伙伴，但丽、明日香和渡治都不在，感觉几乎……空荡荡的。

"Did you ask her to the dance yet?" the military nerd asked, a smirk gracing his face.  
"你向她提出去跳舞了吗？" 这位军事迷问道，脸上带着一丝得意的笑容。

Shinji sighed "She asked me actually."  
真嗣叹了口气：“实际上是她问我的。”

"WHAT?" the boy jumped up "She asked you?!"  
“什么？！”男孩跳了起来，“她问的你？！”

Shinji rolled his eyes "It's not that big of a deal, I didn't even think she liked to dance though…"  
真嗣翻了个白眼：“没那么夸张，我甚至没想到她喜欢跳舞……”

"Not…like...to….dance?" the military nerd seemed barely able to comprehend what was just said, "Shinji! Every girl likes to dance!" Kensuke waved his arms like a madman, probably not attracting any more attention than usual. "How would you even know that, you haven't even known each other for a few months!"  
“不…像…是…会…跳舞？”这位军事宅男似乎难以理解刚才的话，“真嗣！每个女孩都喜欢跳舞的！” 剑介像疯子一样挥舞着手臂，大概也没引起比平时更多的注意。“你怎么会知道这些，你们才认识几个月啊！”

Shinji just smiled, if only he knew.  
真嗣只是微笑，如果他知道的话。

The day went smoothly, a bit dull, but the idea of sitting down to sample Rei's cooking seemed to drag it out even further.  
那天过得还算顺利，虽然有点无聊，但想到要坐下来品尝丽做的饭，时间似乎又被拉得更长了。

Even the walk to her apartment complex felt longer than he remembered. At first, he had felt a sense of alarm at the idea that her apartment wouldn't be in its typical location. Luckily, the familiar demolition equipment he could spot in the distance was all he needed to confirm this was actually Rei Ayanami's apartment complex.  
就连走到她公寓楼的路程都感觉比记忆中要长。起初，他对于她的公寓不在通常位置的想法感到一阵惊慌。幸运的是，远处熟悉的拆除设备足以让他确认这里确实是绫波零的公寓楼。

Heading up the apartment block, he found the same room as always, 402. Knocking, Shinji's brow furrowed at the lack of noise he heard, at least until the door swung open.  
他走向公寓楼，找到了那个一如既往的房间，402 号。敲了敲门，真嗣的眉头因未听到任何声响而皱起，直到门突然打开。

A grin grew on his face at the sight of the bluenette, still in her school uniform, she had draped an apron over it. Peering into the kitchen he could see the massive pot on the stovetop and immediately chuckled to himself at the idea that the two of them eating all that.  
看到蓝发女孩时，他脸上露出了笑容，她仍穿着校服，只是在外面披了件围裙。他朝厨房望去，看到炉子上那口巨大的锅，立刻轻笑起来，想象着两人吃掉所有这些食物的情景。

"You are early." The First Child said in the same monotone voice he had grown accustomed to.  
"你来早了。" 第一适格者用他已习惯的单调声音说道。

"Really?" Shinji rubbed the back of his head sheepishly "Guess I just walked really fast."  
"真的吗？" 真嗣不好意思地挠了挠后脑勺，"大概是我走得特别快吧。"

Rei said nothing for a moment, just looking at him with those crimson eyes, till he noted the commotion on the stovetop behind her.  
绫波沉默了一会儿，只是用那双深红色的眼睛看着他，直到他注意到她身后炉灶上的动静。

"Um, your pot is boiling over."  
“呃，你的锅烧开了。”

Rei's eyes widened as she spun around and worked at a frantic pace to resolve the situation. The Third Children couldn't help but feel a sense of childish euphoria at the sight of the clone working at an uncharacteristically frantic rate.  
丽瞪大了眼睛，转身迅速处理着突发状况。第三适格者们不禁感到一种孩童般的兴奋，看着克隆体以异常慌乱的速度忙碌着。

Stepping inside the apartment, and taking off his shoes, Shinji looked around, looking for anything drastically different. It was the same dwelling he had come to know, bland, devoid of life, rather depressing at least from what he could see here.  
走进公寓，脱下鞋子，真嗣环顾四周，寻找任何显著的变化。这里依旧是他所熟悉的样子，平淡无奇，缺乏生气，至少从他目前所见来看，颇为压抑。

Sliding past the girl, Shinji peered inside of the main part of her apartment. Somehow this meek girl had flipped her cot up against the wall with her dresser keeping it there. The girl wasn't known for having much in her housing in the first place, but somehow, she made the room feel even more empty.  
滑过女孩身边，真嗣朝她公寓的主要部分窥视。不知怎的，这个温顺的女孩竟将她的折叠床翻起抵在墙上，并用梳妆台固定住。女孩原本就不以拥有多少家当而闻名，但不知为何，她让房间显得更加空荡。

Shinji frowned at the chabudai just sitting there. The short-legged table was centered in the room with inverted bowls for four people with tea for each. It was sad that Rei believed the commander would show up, the Third Children figured he could take the time to see how much the girl really knew about Gendo's plans.  
真嗣皱眉看着那张矮脚茶几，它孤零零地摆在房间中央。桌上摆着四个倒扣的碗，每碗都备好了茶，显然是为四人准备的。这让真嗣感到悲哀，雷认为指挥官会现身。他想，或许可以趁此机会探探这女孩对源堂计划究竟了解多少。

He hadn't spent much time with her, Asuka had taken priority, and the oddities this life seemed to throw at him with regularity had kept him from really talking to the bluenette much. Perhaps he could change that from now on.  
他并未与她共度太多时光，明日香总是占据优先，而这一生中似乎定期向他袭来的种种怪事，也让他难以真正与那位蓝发女孩深入交谈。或许从现在起，他可以改变这一点。

Looking back to the kitchen, it seemed Rei had gotten things under control, for the briefest of moments he was reminded of the chaos that Asuka had thrown the Katsuragi residents' kitchen into, how totally different the two of them were. Despite the brief moment of near disaster Rei had just dealt with, the girl seemed so methodical in everything's layout.  
回头望向厨房，似乎丽已经控制住了局面，有那么一瞬间，他想起了明日香给葛城家厨房带来的混乱，两人截然不同。尽管刚刚经历了一场近乎灾难的短暂时刻，丽在每件事的布局上却显得如此有条不紊。

Everything was separated, knives were even strewn out in a perfectly arranged pattern, ingredients seemed to be equally spaced apart, and any spills were wiped up with incredible efficiency.  
一切都井然有序，刀具甚至以一种完美排列的模式散开，食材均匀分布，任何溅出的东西都被高效地擦拭干净。

"Do you need any help Rei?" he offered, Shinji doubted she would, but it beat just sitting alone in the next room.  
“需要帮忙吗，丽？”他主动提出，真嗣怀疑她并不需要，但这总比独自坐在隔壁房间要好。

"No, it is alright," she turned to him after adjusting a dial on the stove "please sit down."  
“不，没关系，”她调整了炉子上的一个旋钮后转向他，“请坐。”

Shrugging, he slipped off this backpack and placed it next to the wall while emptying his pockets of everything but his phone. Sitting down to he could see into the kitchen, he found himself hoping that Rei would at least have somewhat tasty food as his stomach growled.  
他耸了耸肩，脱下背包放在墙边，只留下手机，把口袋里的东西都掏了出来。坐下后，他可以看到厨房，心里暗自希望丽至少能做出一些还算美味的食物，因为他的肚子已经开始咕咕叫了。

Perhaps he could actually teach Asuka how to cook, Shinji smiled at the thought and at the idea of dodging a roller pin whenever the girl got frustrated. At least she'd be able to make something that wasn't too terrible, besides, it'd be good for her to try other things to find happiness in.  
也许他真的可以教明日香做饭，真嗣想到这里笑了笑，想象着在女孩生气时躲避擀面杖的情景。至少她能做出一些不太糟糕的东西，而且，尝试其他事情找到快乐对她也有好处。

_He watched as Soryu just leaned against the wall in front of him, saying nothing, just watching. She hadn't said a word the entire day and he had no words for her either. He couldn't remember a time when she was like this, then again, they rarely went after each other like they had this morning.  
他看着 Soryu 只是靠在他面前的墙上，一言不发，只是注视着。她一整天都没说一句话，他也不知道该对她说些什么。他不记得她有过这样的时刻，不过话说回来，他们很少像今早那样互相追逐。_

Ignoring the specter, Shinji leaned back on his hands, enjoying the actually quite delightful smells starting to permeate through the apartment. Just as he was starting to relax, a knock came from the door.  
无视那幽灵般的存在，Shinji 双手撑地向后靠去，享受着公寓里开始弥漫的相当宜人的香气。正当他开始放松时，门外传来了敲门声。

The Third Children raised an eyebrow. Had he missed someone? Asuka, Misato, Ritsuko… there was no way Gendo…  
第三适格者挑了挑眉。他漏掉了谁吗？Asuka、Misato、Ritsuko……Gendo 怎么可能……

Shinji could only watch as Rei opened the door and the bearded figure became silhouetted against the sunlight.  
真嗣只能眼睁睁地看着丽打开门，那留着胡须的身影在阳光下映出轮廓。

Fuck. 该死。

This was _just_ what he needed today.  
今天他正需要这个。

He clenched his fist in annoyance, on the bright side if Unit-03 was being activated today, there was no way that the commander would take time for some dinner party.  
他恼怒地握紧了拳头，不过好在今天启动了 03 号机，指挥官绝无可能抽出时间参加什么晚宴了。

"Commander Ikari," Shinji couldn't see her face, but he imagined the edges of her lips beginning to curl "please come in."  
"碇司令，" 真嗣看不清她的脸，但他想象着她的嘴角开始上扬，"请进。"

"Thank you, Rei." "谢谢你，绫波。"

That voice… he hated that voice. He hated those glasses. He hated that beard. He hated that indifferent gaze and indifferent face that the man was known for. He hated everything he saw when he looked at the Gendo Ikari.  
那个声音……他讨厌那个声音。他讨厌那副眼镜。他讨厌那把胡子。他讨厌那个男人冷漠的眼神和面无表情的脸。他讨厌他看到的一切，当他看着碇源堂时。

It didn't take long for him to slip off his shoes and make his way to where Shinji was seated. In that moment Shinji would have taken on a hundred Sachiels if that meant he wouldn't have to be here.  
他没花多少时间就脱掉鞋子，走到真嗣坐的地方。那一刻，真嗣宁愿面对一百个萨基尔，只要能不用待在这里。

Not that he wanted to run away from the man, no, if he had it his way, he'd subject the man to every single horror that he had endured. He hadn't wanted to go to that graveyard for the very reason that he might say something stupid, with Gendo Ikari, Shinji found it all too easy to slip up.  
并不是他想逃离那个人，不，如果可以的话，他会让那个人经历他所遭受的一切痛苦。他不想去那个墓地，正是因为他可能会说出一些愚蠢的话，和碇源堂在一起，真嗣发现自己太容易出错了。

The man sat down across from him, his eyes met the man's, they were the same as they always were, cold. Shinji did his best not to look royally peeved, but he doubted he was doing a good job of it.  
那人坐在他对面，目光相遇，一如既往地冰冷。真嗣尽力不显露出极度恼怒，但他怀疑自己做得并不好。

"Shinji." “真嗣。”

"Commander." “指挥官。”

For a moment neither said anything else, each just boring holes into each other's eyes. It wasn't like the graveyard where they had been next to each other, with no eye contact. No, this time the man had to look at him, cold indifference versus burning hatred.  
有那么一会儿，两人都沉默不语，只是目光如炬地盯着对方的眼睛。这和他们在墓地时的情况不同，那时他们并肩而立，却无眼神交流。不，这次男人不得不直视他，冰冷的漠然对上炽烈的仇恨。

"You're doing well at school." Gendo suddenly spoke up, in a very matter-of-fact voice, one that told Shinji there was no pride behind it, no emotion at the idea his son was excelling.  
"你在学校表现不错。" 源渡突然开口，语气非常实事求是，这让真嗣明白，这背后没有骄傲，也没有任何情感，只是因为他儿子成绩优异。

"I didn't know you cared." Shinji countered, of course, the man didn't care, all he cared about was the boy's ability to pilot, damn anything else.  
"我还以为你不在乎呢。" 真嗣反驳道，当然，这个男人并不在乎，他只关心男孩的驾驶能力，其他的一切都无所谓。

Gendo frowned, while behind him Rei had just barely turned her head to see the conversation unfolding in her apartment. Shinji wouldn't even try to guess what was being thought behind those crimson eyes.  
源渡皱起眉头，而站在他身后的绫波刚刚微微转过头，看着这场在她公寓里上演的对话。真嗣甚至不会试图猜测那双深红色眼睛背后的想法。

"I never told you how well of a job you did with the Eight Angel." The older man was changing the subject, seemingly switching his praise in the vain hope that Shinji would fall back to being the timid child that he had first called to NERV.  
“我从没告诉过你，你对八号天使的处理做得有多出色。”年长者转移了话题，似乎在徒劳地希望借此让真嗣重新变回最初被召唤到 NERV 时那个胆怯的孩子。

It had been a long time since Shinji had been that child.  
自从真嗣变成那个孩子以来，已经过去很久了。

Gritting his teeth, his nails dug into his palm under the table, if he didn't know the man was trying to manipulate him, this wouldn't be so difficult.  
他咬紧牙关，桌下指甲深深陷入掌心，若非知道那人正试图操控他，这一切也不会如此艰难。

"Why only me? We all did our part; Rei held the core while Asuka actually killed it."  
“为什么只针对我？我们都有贡献；丽负责了核心，而明日香实际上杀死了它。”

Perhaps it was time to reverse things here.  
或许现在是时候逆转这里的局面了。

Leaning in Shinji's face must have morphed into a look of indifference, "Rei, could you tell me what you're making for us?"  
"真嗣的脸色一定变得漠然，他问道：“丽，你能告诉我你在做什么给我们吃吗？””

Rei once again leaned out to view the boy, "Oyakodon, I will be leaving the meat out of my own dish."  
"丽再次探出身子看向男孩，回答道：“亲子丼，不过我自己的那份不会放肉。””

Shinji nodded and looked back at the commander, whose gaze hadn't changed.  
"真嗣点点头，回头看向司令，他的目光依旧未变。”

"It's fitting, don't you think?" Shinji asked, taking a sip of his Mugicha, the barley tea was incredibly smooth, Rei had done an exquisite job making it.  
"你不觉得这很合适吗？" 真嗣问道，喝了一口他的麦茶，这茶非常顺滑，丽泡得非常出色。

Gendo said nothing, pouring himself a glass of the tea before lifting it up to drink.  
碇源堂什么也没说，给自己倒了一杯茶，然后举杯喝了起来。

"Did Yui have a favorite dish?"  
"唯有什么特别喜欢的菜吗？"

Shinji was sure if he timed it right, he might just be able to get the man to spit out the tea, but he had only caught him before he had taken a sip. Instead, the man froze, cup in the air, his eyes still boring into the boys.  
碇真嗣确信，如果时机把握得当，他或许能让那人把茶喷出来，但他只是在对方还没喝上一口时截住了他。相反，那人僵住了，杯子悬在空中，目光依旧紧盯着男孩。

"Your mother liked many dishes."  
“你母亲喜欢很多菜肴。”

"Hmmm, Rei what's your favorite dish?" he called over the man.  
“嗯，绫波，你最喜欢的菜是什么？”他向那人喊道。

"…I enjoy Miso Soup…" the light voice seemed to float from behind the commander.  
“……我喜欢味噌汤……”那轻柔的声音似乎从指挥官身后飘来。

"Well, did Yui enjoy Miso soup?"  
“那么，Yui 喜欢味噌汤吗？”

Gendo said nothing, just stared at the boy. Maybe changing the topic would get a reaction from him.  
碇一言不发，只是盯着那个男孩。或许换个话题能引起他的反应。

"You know I always wondered if instead of a son you had a daughter, what name did you have picked out?" It was an innocent enough question, one that a curious child would ask, but Shinji couldn't help but hope it did more than get under the man's skin.  
"你知道吗，我一直好奇，如果你有个女儿而不是儿子，你会给她取什么名字？" 这是个无伤大雅的问题，一个好奇的孩子可能会问，但真嗣忍不住希望这不仅仅能触动那人的神经。

"No." he said abruptly, "We knew it would be a boy."  
"不。" 他突然说道，"我们知道会是个男孩。"

A rather convincing lie, said so smoothly and confidently, unfortunately for the man, Shinji knew better.  
一个相当有说服力的谎言，说得如此流畅自信，遗憾的是，对于这个人，真嗣知道得更清楚。

"Really? I thought you would want to be surprised."  
"真的吗？我以为你会想保持惊喜呢。"

"We both wanted to know."  
"我们都想知道。"

"Hmm" Shinji took another sip of his tea, doing his best to remind himself that he didn't need any more attention from the commander than necessary, but who could blame him? This was too good of an opportunity to let slip by.  
"嗯" 真嗣又啜了一口茶，尽力提醒自己不需要从指挥官那里得到更多关注，但谁能怪他呢？这可是个千载难逢的好机会，不能轻易放过。

"Is… the Second Child handling life in Japan adequately?" To Shinji, that might as well have been said in a different language. Since when did he care whether pilots were 'well adjusted'?  
“二号机驾驶员在日本的生活适应得还好吗？”对真嗣来说，这话简直像来自另一个世界的语言。他何时开始关心起驾驶员是否‘适应良好’了？

"Her _name_ is _Asuka_." Shinji could barely hold back the venom in his voice "And yes, Misato was nice enough to let her stay at her apartment." Shinji answered, putting down his tea, "You should give the Colonel a raise just on the cost of food alone."  
“她叫明日香。” 真嗣几乎抑制不住声音中的怨气，“没错，美里好心让她住在她的公寓里。” 真嗣放下茶杯，回答道，“光是伙食费，你就该给美里加薪了。”

"She took it upon herself to house…" the commander was cut short by Rei placing small bowls of white rice in front of them.  
“她自作主张地收留了……” 指挥官的话被丽打断，她将小碗的白米饭摆在他们面前。

Swiftly heading back towards the kitchen, Shinji examined the bowl and to his relief, the rice was not burnt, but instead seemed to be cooked to perfection in contrast to what he had been served last night. Rei either had been practicing for a while or she had a hidden talent.  
真嗣迅速返回厨房，仔细检查着碗里的米饭，令他欣慰的是，米饭并没有烧焦，反而煮得恰到好处，与昨晚他吃到的截然不同。丽要么是练习了很久，要么就是隐藏着烹饪的天赋。

The boy was only able to enjoy one mouthful before being interrupted by his least favorite voice in the world.  
男孩才刚享受了一口美食，就被世界上最不喜欢的声音打断了。

"Regardless… you have done well piloting so far."  
"无论如何……到目前为止，你的驾驶表现不错。"

"Does that include getting killed by the Sixth Angel?" Shinji spat back at the man. He didn't need his praise, far from it. Why was the commander even here? How had Rei managed to even get him here or did he order this?  
"那包括被第六使徒杀死吗？" 真嗣对着那人反唇相讥。他不需要他的赞扬，远非如此。指挥官为什么会在这里？是绫波设法把他请来的，还是他命令这么做的？

Was this all a ruse? Was it too much to ask to have a peaceful dinner?  
这一切难道只是个幌子吗？想要一顿安宁的晚餐，难道要求过分了吗？

"That was… an unfortunate occurrence."  
"那真是……一个不幸的事件。"

"UNFORTUNATE?!" the sound of his bowl slamming down into the table seemed to quiet the entire apartment in an instant, despite it only being the three of them.  
""不幸？！”他的碗猛地砸在桌上，声音之大似乎让整个公寓瞬间安静下来，尽管实际上只有他们三个人。”

"Do you have any idea how painful that was? Do you have any idea what I went through!?"  
""你知道那有多痛吗？你知道我经历了什么吗！？”

He was still talking about Ramiel, right?  
他还在谈论拉米尔，对吧？

That same blank face stared back at the boy before the man set down his own bowl softly and folded his hands on the table.  
那张同样的空白面孔回望着男孩，随后男人轻轻放下自己的碗，双手叠放在桌上。

"One person's pain is inconsequential to NERVs goal, humanity cannot be saved without sacrifice."  
“一个人的痛苦对 NERV 的目标无关紧要，没有牺牲就无法拯救人类。”

Internally, Shinji wanted to reach across the table and strangle the man, why exactly did he think he could just sit there and lie to him? His son, or at least in a way his son. Would it kill the man to act human for once?  
内心深处，真嗣想要越过桌子掐死那个男人，他究竟凭什么认为自己可以坐在那里对他撒谎？他的儿子，或者至少在某种意义上是他的儿子。难道这男人就不能有一次表现得像个人吗？

"Oh, spare me! What's the point of saving humanity if you're not even going to act human by the end of this?!" the boy swore he was starting to see red as he started to push himself up.  
“哦，饶了我吧！如果到最后你都不肯表现得像个人，那拯救人类又有什么意义？！”男孩发誓他开始感到怒火中烧，于是开始用力起身。

"Shinji…" Suddenly his attention was back on the man. "calm down."  
“真嗣……”突然间，他的注意力又回到了那个男人身上。“冷静下来。”

He frowned and realized his grip had broken the chopsticks in his hand.  
他皱了皱眉，意识到自己竟将手中的筷子捏断了。

"It was never been my intention for you to be hurt, just know we all have our burdens."  
“我从未有意让你受伤，只是要知道，我们每个人都有自己的重担。”

That was perhaps the most emotion he had ever received from the man. The boy seemed to deflate, the majority of him wanted to fight that, screaming at the man that there was nothing behind those words. Then… the smallest part of him wanted to believe those words, for just one second in his life he wanted to believe the man meant the words he said.  
这或许是那男人流露出的最真挚的情感了。男孩仿佛泄了气，大部分的他想要反驳，对着那男人大喊这些话背后空无一物。然而…极小一部分的他却想相信这些话，哪怕生命中仅此一秒，他也渴望相信男人所言非虚。

It was the closest thing he had ever heard to an apology from the man, ever, if there was ever something he wanted Gendo to be genuine about, it was the last thing he said to him.  
这是他听过的最接近道歉的话，如果有哪次他希望碇源堂是真心的，那就是他最后对他说的话。

"If that's true… you should have just left me where I was…" he mumbled taking another mouthful of rice.  
“如果那是真的……你本该让我留在原地的……”他喃喃道，又吃了一口米饭。

He could see Rei poking her head around the doorframe, why she seemed so interested in the two of them he couldn't understand.  
他能看到绫波零从门框边探出头来，他不明白她为什么对这两个人如此感兴趣。

Before the conversation could continue, however, the girl again came out with three bowls, this time with the man dish.  
然而，对话尚未继续，女孩再次端出了三碗，这次还带上了男人的盘子。

To Shinji, it smelt perfect, of course, he could make it better, but compared to last night's cooking it was heavenly and he could tell the effort that went into the meal just by looking at it.  
对真嗣来说，这味道已经完美无缺了，当然，他还能做得更好，但与昨晚的烹饪相比，这简直是天堂般的享受，仅凭外观就能看出这顿饭所付出的努力。

"Thank you, Rei," he said as she handed him a bowl, Gendo said nothing, simply nodding.  
“谢谢你，绫波。”她递给他一个碗时，他说道，碇源堂一言不发，只是点了点头。

Waiting till the bluenette came back to the table Shinji couldn't help but think about how this was the closest thing to a family dinner he had ever had and how messed up that was. Even lives where Yui had been alive, it had felt so disingenuous, but this…  
等到蓝发少女回到餐桌旁，真嗣忍不住思考，这是他经历过的最接近家庭晚餐的时刻，而这背后的一切又是多么的扭曲。即便在那些有唯在世的生活中，那种感觉也显得如此虚伪，但这次……

It seemed that the moment Rei sat down all hell broke loose, both Gendo's and his own phone went off, while within seconds, the front door flung open, though, to Rei's credit, she didn't even flinch at the sudden intrusion.  
似乎就在丽坐下的那一刻，整个局面彻底失控了，碇司令和她的手机同时响起，紧接着几秒钟内，前门猛地被打开，尽管如此，丽的表现值得称赞，她对这突如其来的闯入毫无动摇。

"Sir, there's been an incident with Unit-03."  
“先生，三号机出现了状况。”

**One second to midnight 午夜前一秒**

**This wasn't the easiest thing in the world, simply because of the balancing act between Shinji's hostility/annoyance at his father and Gendo's reactions. We don't get a lot of interaction between the two in the rebuilds and hopefully Gendo's attitude it similar towards Shinji in the end.  
这并非世上最简单的事，主要是因为真嗣对其父亲的敌意/恼怒与碇源堂反应之间的微妙平衡。在新剧场版中，两人间的互动并不多，希望最终碇源堂对真嗣的态度能有所转变。**

**SHOUTOUTS! 特别鸣谢！**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – Thanks! Hopefully, nothing derails this train…  
来自美国的 UltraSpink – 谢谢！希望这趟列车不会被任何事情脱轨……**

**k4153r – In the movie Asuka just for some reason opens up and I guess realizes that she can be happy? Either way, it happens by accident but it's the final little bit that Asuka needs to really accept her emotions. I'm not a fan of Shikinami, versus Soryu she's a much weaker character, but the fact she's not as damaged and more overt about her feelings I thought would be an interesting thing for Shinji to deal with.  
k4153r – 在电影中，不知为何明日香敞开了心扉，我想她是意识到了自己可以快乐吧？无论如何，这一转变虽是偶然，却是明日香真正接受自己情感所需的最后一点。我不太喜欢式波，相比惣流，她是一个更弱的角色，但她没有那么伤痕累累，且情感表达更为直白，我认为这对真嗣来说会是一个有趣的挑战。**

**Su Exodus – Ah yes, reaching this level in her development and then….  
苏逃亡记 —— 啊，是的，发展到这个阶段然后……**

**EvaPilotFair – Thanks, maybe one day we will get to see the Austrian Alps….  
伊娃飞行员公平 —— 谢谢，也许有一天我们能看到奥地利阿尔卑斯山……**

**skyf0x – Poor Shinji not getting a single bite of that delicious-looking food.  
天狐 —— 可怜的真嗣一口都没吃到那看起来美味的食物。**

**spartanman2 – Very true, I kinda view Misato's thinking as her wards would be cute together, but not actually pushing the two together. The reason she's at all happy about this is because of her getting closer to Shinji after Ramiel. Had that not happened then Misato wouldn't be this OOC.  
spartanman2 – 非常真实，我有点认为美里只是觉得她的两个孩子在一起会很可爱，但并没有真正推动他们在一起。她之所以对此感到高兴，是因为在与雷米尔一战后她与真嗣的关系更近了。如果没有发生那件事，美里就不会显得如此不符合角色性格。**

**Oh No – I'm pretty sure Shikinami could still deliver a beatdown on par with Soryu, though I doubt it would be as painful HAHA!  
Oh No – 我很确定式波仍然能给对方一个与惣流不相上下的痛击，不过我怀疑会不会有那么痛苦哈哈！**

**Guest – From a certain point of view…  
Guest – 从某个角度来看……**

**Iraki01 – Admitted and accepted, all in the knick of time too.  
Iraki01 – 及时承认并接受了一切。**

**dyinglittelstar – Thanks! The little dinner party we never got to see.  
dyinglittelstar – 谢谢！那场我们从未见过的晚餐聚会。**

**A Guy – Hello There… and nope, spaghetti-4-armed Bardiel is a new one for our Shinji.  
A Guy – 你好啊…没错，四臂意大利面巴迪尔对我们的真嗣来说可是新花样。**

**Berix - Yeah both characters are pretty surprised by each other, Misato more towards Asuka because its so jarring. I doubt Misato would actively push her two wards together but would be happy at the fact they could find happiness with each other. Misato herself (if she's similar to NGE), based on her actions when Shinji isn't coming out of the core after Zeurel, isn't too far stretch if she got him killed, unfortunately Asuka wanted that relationship Misato had with Shinji and right here we almost had that happening.  
Berix - 是的，两个角色都对彼此感到相当惊讶，Misato 对 Asuka 的反应更为强烈，因为这太令人震惊了。我不认为 Misato 会主动撮合她的两个养子，但她会为她们能彼此找到幸福而感到高兴。Misato 自己（如果她与《新世纪福音战士》中的相似），根据她在 Shinji 没有从 Zeruel 的核心中出来的行为，如果她因此害死了他，这并不太牵强，不幸的是 Asuka 渴望得到 Misato 与 Shinji 那样的关系，而在这里我们几乎就要看到那一幕发生了。**

**Guest- WILL DO! Guest- 一定会的！**

**So… I'll see you all next week.  
那么…下周再见。**

**Until Next Time. 下次再会。**


### Chapter 30: "…on the point of no return"  
Chapter 30: "…在无法回头的境地"

The sun sat low on the horizon, casting long shadows and red hues in the evening sky.  
太阳低悬在地平线上，将长长的影子和晚霞洒满天空。

Just like the first time.  
一如初次。

If it had been any other day, Shinji would have enjoyed the sunset, but now he had no time for such indulgences. No, right now he needed to focus.  
若非今日，真嗣本会享受这夕阳美景，但此刻他无暇顾及。不，现在他必须集中精神。

It had felt like a lifetime in itself to get deployed. Rei, the commander, and the boy had all crammed themselves into his car as the chauffeur sped towards the GeoFront.  
对于被派遣来说，感觉就像是一生一世。丽，指挥官和那个男孩都挤进了他的车里，司机疾驰向地底都市。

Unfortunately, Shinji had left his bag back at Rei's apartment, a small inconvenience but he shouldn't be thinking about it right now.  
不幸的是，真嗣把他的包落在了丽的公寓里，虽然是个小麻烦，但他现在不应该去想这件事。

They had him change into his plugsuit in what had to be record time, he was lucky his pendent wasn't digging into his skin since he had no time to adjust it. When he finally got to the entry plug, they hadn't even bothered to hide the massive extra apparatuses behind the pilot's seat. It wasn't like the dummy plug was a problem, but still… he expected to at least be lied to.  
他们让他以创纪录的速度换上了插入栓服，幸运的是，他没有时间调整项链，所以它没有硌到他的皮肤。当他终于进入插入栓时，他们甚至懒得隐藏驾驶员座位后面巨大的额外设备。虽然模拟插入栓不是问题，但他还是期望至少能被蒙在鼓里。

Right now, Unit-01 was crouched in a valley of rice patties, Shinji was technically awaiting orders, but the truth was he knew he wouldn't have to move.  
此刻，零壹号机正蹲伏在一片稻田之中，理论上真嗣正在等待指令，但事实上他清楚自己无需移动。

Bardiel would come to him.  
巴迪尔会主动找上门来。

Unlike before, the entry plug didn't give him comfort, there was no feeling of warm belonging. He felt like a stranger in someone's home like he wasn't wanted here.  
与以往不同，插入栓并未给予他安慰，没有那种温暖的归属感。他觉得自己像是闯入他人家中的陌生人，仿佛这里并不欢迎他。

He ignored the random callouts from his comms, trying to drown out anything and everything, he reached out, deep within the EVA, searching for his only company.  
他无视了通讯中杂乱的呼喊，试图屏蔽一切干扰，他深入到外太空服中，寻找着他唯一的伴侣。

Yui was there, and even again Sahaquiel he hadn't truly reached out to her like this. He needed her help with this fight, he knew he would.  
Yui 在那里，尽管他从未真正这样向她求助过。他知道在这场战斗中他需要她的帮助。

Reaching out, he tried to convey that to her, but there was still that hesitation, that reluctance to connect. He couldn't exactly blame her, he wasn't really her son, but right now he needed her help. This wouldn't be aiming a rifle, or standing under a falling Angel, no, this would be a true fight.  
他伸出手，试图向她传达这一点，但仍有犹豫，仍有不愿连接的迟疑。他不能完全责怪她，他毕竟不是她的亲生儿子，但此刻他需要她的帮助。这不再是瞄准步枪，或是站在坠落的使徒之下，不，这将是一场真正的战斗。

He had no backup, he had no assistance, all he had was himself and even now his heart pounded in his chest.  
他没有后援，没有援助，他唯一拥有的就是他自己，即便此刻他的心脏在胸腔中狂跳不已。

"_Quit whining and focus dammit, getting bent out of shape over spilled milk isn't going to do us any good right now!"_  
“别再抱怨了，集中注意力，为打翻的牛奶哭泣对我们现在毫无帮助！”

He remembered those words Asuka had scolded him with the first time, but couldn't even bring himself to smile at remembering those words. Though they might just be the ones he needed to hear.  
他记得这些话是第一次被明日香训斥时说的，但此刻连回想起这些话都笑不出来。尽管这些话可能正是他需要听到的。

"Target approaching." A female voice called out inside the entry plug.  
“目标接近中。”驾驶舱内传来一个女性的声音。

Shinji's eyes were drawn to the reticle now illuminating the humanoid figure marching towards him. The flashes of explosions trickled onto his screen, he wondered how they could even waste ammunition against the Evangelion despite knowing it would have no effect.  
真嗣的目光被此刻正照亮着向他走来的人形身影的瞄准线所吸引。爆炸的闪光在他的屏幕上流淌，他不禁疑惑，明知对 EVA 无效，他们为何还要浪费弹药。

As the frontline of armored vehicles began to retreat, Shinji watched a puff of smoke appear from the back of the EVA, and a piece of armor fly off. He knew that was the ejection mechanism, but the entry plug itself refused to leave the humanoid.  
当装甲车前线开始撤退时，真嗣看到 EVA 背部冒出一股烟雾，一片装甲飞散开来。他知道那是弹射机制，但驾驶舱本身却拒绝离开那个人形机体。

At the very least, Gendo had tried to save Toji this time around too.  
至少这一次，源堂也尝试着去救冬二了。

For that, Shinji could say he was at least grateful.  
为此，真嗣至少可以说他是心存感激的。

Unit-03 lumbered forwards, its slouched figure showing no signs of interest in anything but the purple Evangelion right in its path.  
三号机蹒跚前行，它那驼背的身影对除了眼前那台紫色福音战士之外的一切都毫无兴趣。

"Your target is approaching; it must be destroyed." That man's voice was as emotionless as always, Shinji had nothing to say to him, instead all he could do was try to keep his heart from racing in his chest.  
“目标正在接近；必须摧毁它。”那个男人的声音一如既往地毫无情感，真嗣对他无话可说，只能尽力让自己的心跳不至于在胸腔中加速。

An effort that was in vain.  
然而这番努力终归是徒劳。

He waited, letting Bardiel get closer, there was no need to extend his power cable any more than necessary, not that he expected it to be a long fight.  
他等待着，任由巴迪尔靠近，没有必要再延长他的能量缆线，他并不预期这将是一场持久战。

The possessed Evangelion stopped a few hundred yards away from Unit-01 and simply stood there for a few moments, Shinji wasted no time retrieving his Eva's progressive knife, if he was going to have to pry out the entry plug, he would need it.  
被附身的 EVA 在距离零一机几百码处停下，静静伫立片刻，真嗣毫不犹豫地取回了自己 EVA 的渐进刀，如果他必须撬出插入栓，这把刀将是必需的。

The Angel's head reared back as it let out a high-pitched roar that was foreign to the boy before it fell down on all fours.  
天使的头猛地向后仰去，发出一声尖锐的咆哮，这声音对男孩来说异常陌生，随后它四肢着地倒了下去。

The Third Children expected it to throw out its arms, just as it had so many times before, instead, it launched itself upwards, raining down on Unit-01 with its leg outstretched.  
第三使徒本以为它会像之前多次那样伸出双臂，然而这次它却猛地向上跃起，一条腿伸展开来，如雨点般向初号机倾泻而下。

That was new. 这倒是新鲜。

Bracing for the impact, Shinji caught the foot but was sent flying backward as Unit-03 pushed off him.  
真嗣做好冲击准备，抓住了三号机的脚，却被其推力击飞，向后倒去。

Skipping across the rice patties, Shinji finally stopped himself and pushed Unit-01 up to see Unit-03 on all fours, growling at him like a feral animal.  
穿梭于稻田之间，真嗣终于停下脚步，将初号机推上前去，只见三号机四肢着地，像野兽般对他咆哮。

Finding his footing, Unit-01 rushed at the Angel, the pilot making sure he was ready to dodge any limbs that may extend themselves to grab onto him.  
稳住脚步后，初号机向使徒冲去，驾驶员确保自己准备好躲避任何可能伸出来抓住他的肢体。

Just as he thought, those arms rushed out to meet him, extending in an inhuman way that no EVA was designed to do. Dodging both arms he plowed into the Angel, sending it back into a canyon wall.  
正如他所料，那些手臂迅速伸出迎向他，以一种非人般的方式延伸，这是任何 EVA 设计中都不曾有的。他躲过双臂，猛撞向使徒，将其击退至峡谷壁上。

Shinji didn't have time to recover though, as it simply shook its head and launched from the terrain with such force it cracked the stone from where it pushed off from.  
然而，真嗣没有时间恢复，因为那生物只是摇了摇头，便以巨大的力量从地面上弹射而起，它蹬踏之处石块碎裂。

Throwing out his AT field, Shinji noted how weak of a connection he was feeling, fighting to concentrate on both the barrier and reaching out to Yui, the boy was starting to sweat.  
真嗣释放出 AT 力场，他注意到自己感受到的连接是多么微弱，他努力集中精神于屏障和与唯的联系上，汗水开始从男孩的额头渗出。

The Angel, still in the air, tucked its feet up against its body and threw out its arms in an X pattern, smashing through the barrier, though giving enough time for Shinji to counter its next blow.  
天使仍在空中，将双脚紧贴身体，双臂呈 X 形展开，冲破了屏障，尽管这给了真嗣足够的时间来应对它的下一击。

As the two began to tangle, the boy felt something, something was wrong.  
当两人开始缠斗时，男孩感觉到有些不对劲，有什么地方出了问题。

What was this? 这是什么？

This feeling, the way Unit-03 was fighting, the way the _Angel_ was fighting… it was wrong and _familiar_.  
这种感觉，03 号机战斗的方式，使徒战斗的方式……这一切都既错误又熟悉。

Blocking another swipe Shinji threw out his AT field in order to gain some distance. He didn't need his own EVA to be corrupted by the blue goo now trickling out the Unit-03, but he also needed time to think, he needed to understand what this feeling was.  
挡下又一次攻击，真嗣释放出自己的 AT 力场以拉开距离。他不想让自己的 EVA 被从 03 号机中渗出的蓝色粘液污染，但他也需要时间思考，他需要弄清楚这种感觉是什么。

He couldn't even take a breath before the Angel was on him again, jumping into the air just as it had the first time. He dodged, letting it crash into the ground, throwing up dirt and debris.  
他还没来得及喘口气，天使又扑了上来，就像第一次那样跃入空中。他闪避开来，任由它撞向地面，扬起尘土和碎片。

But he didn't even have time to throw up an AT field this time.  
但这次他连展开 AT 力场的时间都没有。

Forced on the defensive, the possessed Evangelion came after him, keeping up its barrage of swipes and jabs until it finally crouched down and a leg swept at his feet.  
被迫处于防守状态，被附身的 EVA 紧追不舍，持续发动猛烈的挥击和刺击，直到最终蹲下身来，一腿扫向他的脚踝。

That was when it all became clear.  
就在那时，一切变得明朗起来。

It was a move he was all familiar with, _too_ familiar with.  
这一招他再熟悉不过了，实在是太熟悉了。

No. 不。

The final turn of a gear, the final piece of a puzzle.  
齿轮的最后一转，拼图的最后一块。

Shinji couldn't believe it, but his mind wandered back to when Unit-02 first arrived.  
真嗣简直不敢相信，但他的思绪飘回了二号机初次抵达的时候。

_Shinji could still see her foot coming to sweep him a few moments before it would have hit, it was after all a classic thing for her to do.  
真嗣仍能清晰地看到她的脚即将扫向他，就在几秒钟前，这毕竟是她一贯的作风。_

No… 不……

The Angel took his lapse in concertation to jump on Unit-01, throwing him into the side of the valley. It took every bit of concentration for Shinji to grab the wrists of Bardiel as its hands wrapped around Unit-01's neck.  
天使趁其分神之际，跃上初号机，将其撞向山谷一侧。真嗣竭尽全力才抓住了巴迪尔的手腕，当时它的双手正紧紧勒住初号机的脖子。

No no no no… 不不不不……

"Who the hell is in Unit-03?!" he shouted back to command, no, at the Commander.  
"03 号机里到底是谁？!" 他向指挥室，不，向司令喊道。

"Irrelevant, neutralize the Angel." He heard Gendo's voice, the same cold voice he always heard.  
"无关紧要，消灭使徒。" 他听到了碇源堂的声音，那总是冷冰冰的声音。

"It's her, isn't it?" he asked, his voice roaring, "It's ASUKA!" He didn't want to believe it, he didn't even want to say those words, but he had to.  
"是她，对吧？" 他吼道，"是明日香！" 他不愿相信，甚至不想说出这些话，但他必须说。

The silence was his answer.  
沉默就是他的回答。

Why the hell was she in Unit-03?! It wasn't like she'd be able to sync with it, so why have her as the test pilot?!  
她到底为什么会进入 03 号机？！她不可能与它同步，那为什么让她当测试驾驶员？！

He struggled against the power of Bardiel, but he couldn't let it end here, he needed to do something dammit!  
他奋力抵抗巴迪尔的力量，但他不能让这一切就此结束，他需要做些什么，该死的！

"What the hell is she doing in Unit-03?!" he choked out as the pressure around his neck began to lighten, slowly he was pulling the hands of the Angel off him, he could breathe!  
"她到底在 03 号机里搞什么鬼？！" 他喘息着说道，随着颈部压力开始减轻，他慢慢挣脱了使徒的双手，终于能够呼吸了！

But the explosions on Unit-03's shoulders signaled the end of Shinji's relief, two more red arms sprouted as pieces of armor fell away. His eye's widened as the fleshy appendages rushed towards him, wrapping around Unit-01s neck.  
但 03 号机肩部的爆炸预示着真嗣的喘息即将结束，更多的红色手臂从破碎的装甲中伸出。他的眼睛睁大，看着这些肉质的触手向他冲来，缠绕在 01 号机的脖子上。

"Pilot, fight back." That icy voice came over his comms again.  
"驾驶员，反击。" 那个冰冷的声音再次通过通讯传来。

But… it was her inside.  
但…里面是她。

He wouldn't hurt her, he wouldn't do to her what he had done to Toji, no… never.  
他不会伤害她，他不会对她做出对冬二那样的事，不…绝不会。

He'd let her kill him before he did that.  
他宁愿让她杀了自己，也不会那么做。

All he could do was stare into those red eyes of Unit-03, it was her behind them, it was Asuka.  
他所能做的只是凝视着三号机那双红色的眼睛，是她藏在那背后，是明日香。

It was all so poetic.  
这一切都如此富有诗意。

_His mind floated, instead of the Angel on top of him, now it was just her. Half of her face was bandaged and her arm too, the sand underneath him was rough yet cool and he could almost hear the gentle lapping of waves against the shoreline.  
他的思绪飘荡着，压在他身上的不再是使徒，而是她。她半边脸和手臂都缠着绷带，身下的沙子粗糙却凉爽，他几乎能听到海浪轻拍岸边的声音。_

_How it could have been, how it_ should _have been…_  
本可以是怎样的，本应该是怎样的……

_He wanted this. 他渴望这个。_

If this meant not hurting her if this meant him not doing to her what he did to Toji…  
如果这意味着不再伤害她，如果这意味着他不会对她做出对冬二所做的事……

He was willing to die for that.  
他愿意为那件事而死。

And he accepted this, slowly he let his arms relax, there was nothing left for him to do. Yui retreated from him, not recognizing the boy who was accepting his death and he was sure his sync ratio was falling. This would be the end.  
他接受了这一点，慢慢地放松了双臂，他已经无事可做了。Yui 从他身边退开，没有认出那个接受死亡的男孩，他确信自己的同步率正在下降。这将是一切的终结。

.

.

.

But all that was cut short.  
但这一切都被打断了。

The world turned red, and the humming of something moving behind him began to increase.  
世界变得一片猩红，某种东西在他身后移动的嗡嗡声开始加剧。

Two red 'arms' came down over the controls as something came over his vision.  
两条红色的‘手臂’覆盖在控制器上，某种东西遮蔽了他的视线。

'DMYSYS, GOLGOTHA BASE BUILT' it read.  
上面显示着：‘DMYSYS，GOLGOTHA 基地已建成’。

The dummy plug. 那个虚拟插头。

How could he have forgotten?  
他怎么可能忘记？

ʡʘʘʢ

What disturbed Kōzō Fuyutsuki the most was not the relaxing heartrate of the Third Child when it seemed all hope was lost. It wasn't the coolness he was displaying at the realization of his own death.  
最让冬月耕造感到不安的，并非是在似乎一切希望都已破灭时，第三适格者那放松的心跳。也不是他在意识到自己即将死亡时的那份冷静。

No. 不。

What disturbed him was the laughter.  
让他感到不安的是那笑声。

The laughter at what should have been his salvation.  
那本应是他的救赎之时所发出的笑声。

It had started once the dummy plug activated. Starting as a slow chuckle, then finally building to be a nearly uncontrollable outburst.  
这一切始于那个替身插件被激活之时。起初只是低沉的轻笑，随后逐渐升级为几乎无法自控的爆发。

Gendo, to his credit, wasn't showing any emotion at the fact his son was currently having some sort of breakdown inside the entry plug of Unit-01.  
值得称赞的是，碇源堂并未因他的儿子此刻在初号机插入栓内陷入某种崩溃状态而显露任何情绪。

At least, that was until he spoke up, trying to keep his voice steady.  
至少，在他开口之前是这样的，他试图保持声音的平稳。

"You, you think you can just make me kill her again?" the boy was trying to control himself again "I. Won't. Let. You!" he roared, before every screen in the command center lit up with red.  
“你，你以为你能让我再杀她一次吗？”男孩再次试图控制自己，“我. 不. 会. 让. 你！”他咆哮着，随即指挥中心的所有屏幕都亮起了红色。

"Sir," Maya? Yes, that was her name "the dummy plug has been rejected!"  
"先生，" 真嗣？是的，那是她的名字 "替身插入栓被拒绝了！"

"Pilot sync ratio rising!"  
"驾驶员同步率上升！"

"What the hell is going on?" the elderly man could do nothing but ask, the dummy plug was still experimental, but it seemed like the boy had somehow rejected it himself!  
"这到底是怎么回事？" 老人只能如此问道，替身插入栓仍在实验阶段，但似乎那男孩不知怎么地自己拒绝了它！

"What is the current sync rate?" the commander asked to Makoto, or at least Kōzō thought that was his name.  
"当前同步率是多少？" 指挥官问真琴，至少耕助认为是这个名字。

"Currently at 72.3 and rising sir!"  
"目前是 72.3，还在上升，长官！"

"Do you think your son rejected the dummy system somehow?" the elderly man turned to the seated man next to him.  
"你觉得你儿子是不是以某种方式拒绝了模拟系统？" 老人转向坐在他旁边的男子。

There was only silence for his answer.  
他的回答只有沉默。

ʡʘʘʢ

"C'mon…" Shinji growled, the red system that had deployed over him had retreated, curtesy of Yui, or at least his ability to somewhat force her to reject it.  
“来吧……”真嗣咆哮道，覆盖在他身上的红色系统已经撤退，这要归功于 Yui，或者至少是他有能力迫使她拒绝它。

It was like lassoing an animal and dragging it along, she was now fighting against him, not wanting anything to do with the enraged boy.  
这就像用绳索套住一只动物并拖着它走，她现在正与他对抗，不想与那个愤怒的男孩有任何瓜葛。

He had Gendo to thank for that, to think the man could force him to hurt _her_, to _hurt_ Asuka of all people.  
这一切都得感谢源堂，没想到那男人竟能逼他伤害她，伤害到明日香这样的女孩。

No, he could save her.  
不，他可以救她。

Yui still resisted, but he didn't care, not right now, he needed to be careful anyway, if he showed too much skill then what was the point of saving her, only to be held in suspicion.  
唯仍在抗拒，但他此刻并不在意，他需要谨慎行事，如果展现太多技艺，那么救她的意义何在？只是换来猜疑罢了。

Shinji flailed his legs, realizing that the Angel had done nothing to protect itself from Unit-01's lower half, Shinji swept Bardiel, though it didn't free him from the Angel's grip, that was his plan.  
真嗣猛蹬双腿，意识到使徒并未对初号机下半身采取防御措施，他顺势扫倒了巴迪尔，尽管这并未让他从使徒的钳制中解脱，但这是他的计划。

They rolled along the rice patties, water and mud covering his view periodically, but he was working just as much on feeling as vision.  
他们在稻田里翻滚，水与泥不时覆盖他的视线，但他更多依靠感觉而非视觉来应对。

Juggling the fight and forcing a bond with Yui was not something he had been forced to do before, but now he needed to perform, he needed to win.  
同时应对战斗并强行与唯建立联系，这是他以前未曾经历过的挑战，但现在他必须全力以赴，他必须取胜。

For her. 为了她。

With the constant rolling, only one arm was still latched onto Unit-01 as Bardiel got up, practically dragging the operational Evangelion with it, but Shinji already had his second progressive knife deployed.  
在不断的翻滚中，只有一只手臂仍然紧抓着初号机，巴迪尔起身时几乎是在拖着这台可操作的福音战士，但真嗣已经拔出了他的第二把高进度刀。

With all the strength he could muster, Shinji swung the Angel around with both arms, slamming it into the wall of the valley face first.  
真嗣用尽全力，双臂挥动着使徒，将其正面猛击在峡谷的岩壁上。

Jumping onto its back, he grabbed his second progressive knife as Bardiel began to stand, the sight would have been comical if he weren't fighting for the life of a fellow pilot.  
他跃上它的背部，抓住第二把渐进式刀刃，巴迪尔开始站立，这一幕本该滑稽，若非他在为一位同僚驾驶员的生命而战。

No, it was for someone who was more than that.  
不，这是为了某个超越这一切的人。

The 9th Angel flailed with Unit-01 on its back, making its way now into the small town further down the valley, but Shinji held on tight, fighting to keep balance as he cut away the blue good holding down Asuka's entry plug with the progressive knife.  
第 9 使徒背着初号机在山谷中挣扎前行，逐渐逼近下方的小镇，但真嗣紧抓不放，努力保持平衡，同时用高振动粒子刀切开束缚明日香插入栓的蓝色污染物质。

Just… a little… more…. 就差…一点…了…

Slicing through the blue contamination, Shinji grabbed what little of the entry plug was sticking out of the EVA and pulled.  
切开蓝色污染物质后，真嗣抓住插入栓露出的部分，用力拉扯。

Slicing more strands of blue ooze, he continued to pull, doing everything in his power to still stay on the back of the four-armed Angel. Slicing a few more strands of corruption, Shinji pulled one more time, the last bit of corruption snapping at the stress, letting him fall off the back of the Angel with the entry plug in his grasp.  
他继续切割着更多的蓝色黏液，竭尽全力保持自己在四臂使徒背上的位置。再切断几缕腐败之物，真嗣又拉了一下，最后一丝腐败在压力下断裂，让他带着插入栓从使徒背上跌落。

Looking it over, he could tell it was covered in some blue crystalline structure, but he didn't have much time to examine it more, as Bardiel had turned around to face him again, its maw open and growling.  
仔细观察，他发现上面覆盖着某种蓝色晶体结构，但他没有太多时间进一步检查，因为巴迪尔已经转过身来面对他，张开大口咆哮着。

Unit-01 stood up to face its opponent, whose additional red arms had gone limp, simply hanging from the shoulders, but something else was in its hands.  
初号机起身面对对手，对方额外的红色手臂已经瘫软，只是从肩膀上垂挂下来，但它的手中还握着别的东西。

His cord…. How could he have forgotten, if it was cut, he only had a few minutes left…  
他的脐带……他怎会忘记，若已被剪断，他只剩下几分钟可活……

He didn't have time to think as the Angel rushed forwards again, crawling along the ground on all fours this time.  
他来不及思考，使徒再次向前冲来，这次是四肢着地爬行。

Shinji tucked the entry plug against his chest with his left arm, the same way someone would with an American Football, while he readied himself and his weakened AT field with his right.  
真嗣用左臂将插入栓紧抱在胸前，就像抱着美式橄榄球一样，同时用右臂准备好自己虚弱的 A.T.力场。

Between fighting the Angel, forcing a bond with Yui, and protecting Asuka, all on battery power… well this wasn't going to be easy.  
既要对抗使徒，又要与唯建立联系，还要保护明日香，这一切都依赖电池供电……这可不容易。

He thought about running, running away to set down the entry plug and finish the fight, but Bardiel was so close, it would be almost impossible to disengage at this point.  
他考虑过逃跑，逃离插入栓结束战斗，但巴迪尔如此接近，此刻想要脱离几乎是不可能的。

Dodging the creature, they seemed to circle each other, Shinji making sure to dodge every lunge from Unit-03 while struggling to even remain in sync with his own EVA.  
躲避着那怪物，他们似乎在互相绕圈，真嗣确保躲开 03 号机的每一次扑击，同时挣扎着与自己的 EVA 保持同步。

Dammit, Yui… he struggled as she pulled away again, which was all Bardiel needed.  
该死，唯……他挣扎着，她再次拉开了距离，而这正是巴迪尔所需要的。

One arm rushed forwards, stretching beyond what should be the physical limit of the body it belonged to. Wrapping around his legs, Shinji was yanked from his feet, first onto his back, crushing a number of small houses, he didn't even bother to try and make his way to his feet, not when he held the comparatively fragile entry plug.  
一条手臂猛地向前冲去，伸展到了本应是其所附身体物理极限之外。它缠绕住他的双腿，真嗣被拽离地面，先是背部着地，压碎了数座小屋，他甚至无暇尝试起身，尤其当他怀抱着相对脆弱的插入栓时。

Before long he was flipped over to his chest, he stretched out his arm, not wanting to crush the entry plug beneath his Evangelion, losing his knife, he tried pushing himself up with his remaining hand, but the sudden impact on his back shoved him back into the ground, while the fire erupting from his back made it known how the angel was tearing at him.  
不久后他被翻转至胸口朝下，他伸出手臂，不想让插入栓被自己的 EVA 压碎，失去了刀，他试图用剩下的手撑起自己，但背部突如其来的冲击又将他推回地面，而背后爆发的火焰则昭示着使徒正在撕裂他。

The angel stopped, its focus seemingly on the entry plug as it leaned forwards and grasped Unit-01s left hand, which did its best to keep the Angel's own from crushing the entry plug.  
使徒停了下来，它的注意力似乎集中在插入栓上，它向前倾身并抓住了初号机的左手，后者正竭力阻止使徒的手压碎插入栓。

The angel unexpectedly pulled the hand upwards and slammed it into the ground, Shinji could only watch as the shock buckled the structure slightly. Again the Angel slammed their two hands down into the streets between the buildings, causing more fractures to form in the tube's structure.  
天使出乎意料地将手向上猛拉，重重砸向地面，真嗣只能眼睁睁看着冲击波使结构略微变形。天使再次将双手猛击在建筑物之间的街道上，导致管道结构中更多裂缝形成。

As he watched the Angel pull up his hand again the boy decided he had no other option, Shinji readied his AT field, or at least what little he could muster of one, he would use that to throw the Angel off him, hopefully slicing it in half. He'd play it off as a fluke, something that shouldn't have happened, but his plan was crushed as a red warning appeared on his screen.  
当看到天使再次举起手时，少年决定别无选择，真嗣准备启动 AT 力场，尽管他只能勉强凝聚出一点，他打算用这个来摆脱天使，希望能将其一分为二。他会将其归咎于意外，本不该发生的事情，但他的计划被屏幕上突然出现的红色警告粉碎了。

0:00

The timer flashed and Shinji's stomach dropped as he could only watch his own EVAs grip loosen mid-fall, sending the entry plug flying.  
计时器闪烁，真嗣的胃一沉，他只能眼看着 EVA 在半空中松开了握持，将插入栓抛飞出去。

The Third Children watched in horror as the entry plug plowed through houses, he witnessed buildings crumbles as it went through them light a scythe through grass, making a path of destruction as it went.  
第三适格者们惊恐地看着插入栓横扫过房屋，他目睹建筑如同镰刀割草般崩塌，所经之处留下一片废墟。

Finally, it came to a stop, its structure resembling more a shattered plane fuselage than an entry plug. The metal was warped and twisted in all directions as LCL spilled out of it.  
最终，它停了下来，结构更像是一架破碎的飞机机身而非插入栓。金属扭曲变形，四处翘起，LCL 从中溢出。

But that's not what Shinji's eyes saw.  
但那并非真嗣眼中所见之景。

_No, he was back in the GeoFront, witnessing what was left of the carcass that had been Unit-02. The clumps of meat and metal that had protected Asuka from so many Angels, had become her tomb.  
不，他回到了地底都市 GeoFront，目睹了二号机残骸的遗迹。那些曾经保护明日香免受众多使徒伤害的肉块与金属，如今成了她的坟墓。_

_And it was his fault.  
而这都是他的错。_

All he could do was scream.  
他唯一能做的，只有尖叫。

ʡʘʘʢ

Fuyutsuki remembered the screams of the Third Children when the boy was dying inside Unit-01. He remembered the way the sound had seemingly clawed at his ears.  
冬月记得第三适格者男孩在初号机内濒死时的尖叫声。他记得那声音仿佛用爪子抓挠着他的耳朵。

This was not one of those screams.  
这不是那种尖叫。

This was not out of physical pain.  
这不是因为肉体上的痛苦。

Kōzō couldn't place where this was coming from, but he knew exactly what emotion controlled the boy next.  
Kōzō无法确定这种感觉源自何处，但他清楚地知道接下来那个男孩被何种情绪所支配。

Rage. 愤怒。

"Commander! Unit-01…" The girl stopped, as all the eyes were drawn to the screen, watching Unit-01's frame slowly lift then throw Unit-03 across the valley.  
"指挥官！初号机……" 女孩话音未落，所有目光都被吸引到了屏幕上，只见初号机的身影缓缓升起，随即将三号机猛地掷向山谷。

The armor on its back had been shredded, but otherwise, it seemed fine, at least until they saw its face, the jaw was unhinged.  
它背上的盔甲已被撕裂，除此之外，它似乎安然无恙，至少在他们看到它的脸之前，那下巴已经脱臼了。

"It's gone berserk!" "它失控了！"

"No, the pilot is still synced with it!"  
"不，驾驶员还与它同步着！"

"But look at those readings! It's fluctuating, what's going on?!"  
"但看看那些读数！它在波动，到底发生了什么？！"

Kōzō watched as before the onyx Evangelion could get up, its right shoulder was torn from its body.  
高藏看着那台黑曜石般的福音战士还未起身，其右肩便被撕裂脱离了身体。

The Angel roared, either in pain or at the loss of its arm, but then once more, its right leg exploded from its body.  
使徒咆哮着，或许是因疼痛，或是因失去手臂，但紧接着，它的右腿再次从身体上爆裂开来。

The elderly man's eyes widened, it wasn't just random, he could see the AT field being used to crush the leg.  
老者的眼睛睁大了，这并非偶然，他能看到 AT 力场被用来碾碎那条腿。

The Third Child was using his AT field offensively, he was using it as a weapon.  
第三适格者正利用他的 AT 力场进行攻击，将其作为武器使用。

The sounds of rage had begun to be more sporadic, lining up with Unit-01's strikes at the 9th angel. Looking down at the commander, Gendo Ikari's face betrayed no emotion, he showed nothing when faced with this increasingly gory scene.  
愤怒的声响开始变得零星，与初号机对第九使徒的攻击同步。看着指挥官，碇源堂的脸上毫无表情，面对这愈发血腥的场面，他毫无动容。

The grey-haired professor couldn't look away as the remaining limbs were systematically crushed in increasingly brutal ways, before being sliced off.  
灰白头发的教授无法移开视线，眼看着剩余的肢体被系统性地以越来越残忍的方式碾碎，然后被切断。

Unit-01's purple hand latched onto Unit-03's head, while its foot held down its chest.  
零一号机的紫色手掌紧紧抓住零三号机的头部，同时一脚踩住其胸膛。

In a spectacle that made his own hardened stomach churn, the man watched as the head of Unit-03 was ripped clean from the torso, along with the spine and accompanying hardware which allowed the EVA to be controlled.  
眼前的惨状让这位见惯风浪的男子也感到胃里一阵翻腾，他目睹着零三号机的头颅被生生撕扯下来，连带着脊椎和控制 EVA 所需的配套设备一并被扯断。

The boy's rage hadn't quite been satisfied yet apparently, as Unit-01's arms came crashing down on the torso. Strike after strike with fist and AT field alike sent red chunks of flesh and fluid into the heavens, only for it to come back to earth in a crimson rain.  
显然，少年的怒火尚未平息，零一号机的双臂猛烈地砸向那具躯体。一拳接一拳，伴随着 AT 力场的冲击，将红色的肉块和液体抛向高空，最终化作一场血雨洒落回地面。

Before long, the lone Unit-01 was simply kneeling in a red pool of gore, red liquids and chunks running down its armor in a fleshy waterfall as its chest seemed to heave at the physical undertaking it had just performed. It threw its arms in the air and let out a victorious roar, echoed by the pilot inside, though his was now clearly one of pain.  
不久，孤零零的初号机就只是跪在一片血泊中，红色的液体和肉块顺着它的装甲流淌，形成了一道血肉瀑布，它的胸膛似乎因刚刚完成的体力活而起伏。它高举双臂，发出胜利的咆哮，驾驶舱内的驾驶员也随之呼应，尽管他的声音现在明显带着痛苦。

To the disbelief of everyone watching in the command center, Unit-01 stood up and calmly walked to where the Second Child's entry plug had landed.  
令指挥中心所有人难以置信的是，初号机站起身来，平静地走向二号机驾驶舱坠落的地方。

The Sub-Commander had to admit it wasn't a promising sight, with red LCL flowing out of every break in the superstructure and bits of metal twisted in a nightmarish pattern.  
副司令不得不承认，这景象并不乐观，红色的 LCL 从超级结构的每一处裂缝中流出，金属碎片扭曲成噩梦般的图案。

Scooping up the entry plug with a care that Kōzō thought impossible after that horrific display of violence, Unit-01 took off to the nearest entrance of the GeoFront available to it.  
小心翼翼地抱起插入栓，那种细致让高藏觉得在那场恐怖的暴力展示之后简直难以置信，初号机朝着最近的 GeoFront 入口疾驰而去。

"Do you have any words?" the man muttered as he felt the last of his hair that still held color turn grey.  
"你还有什么话要说吗？" 那人喃喃自语，感觉到自己最后几缕尚带颜色的头发也变得灰白。

The silence that met him was deafening.  
迎接他的沉默震耳欲聋。

### Chapter 31: "…Mother should I build the wall…"  
Chapter 31: "…母亲，我该建那堵墙吗…"

She was floating. 她在漂浮。

No, she wasn't floating, it was more like she was drifting.  
不，她并没有漂浮，更像是她在飘荡。

That wasn't right either, nothing felt right here.  
这也不对，这里的一切感觉都不对劲。

Asuka tried to move but she couldn't, she couldn't do anything, the girl could only look in front of her, staring at the crimson emptiness.  
明日香试图移动，但她做不到，她什么也做不了，女孩只能凝视前方，盯着那片深红的虚无。

She knew the taste, she knew the smell, it was that of blood, the same sensation that she received each time she was in an entry plug, but there was nothing else, no controls, no edges to this space.  
她熟悉这味道，她熟悉这气味，那是血的味道，每次她进入插入栓时都会感受到的同样感觉，但除此之外，别无他物，没有控制器，没有这个空间的边缘。

It was just… emptiness. 只是……空虚。

Only the cold, only the bone-chilling sensations that surrounded her.  
只有寒冷，只有那环绕着她的彻骨寒意。

It edged closer, like it was somehow sentient, reaching out, trying to get closer.  
它缓缓靠近，仿佛具有某种意识，伸出触角，试图更进一步。

Asuka couldn't do anything as it brushed against her mind, as if she herself were the Evangelion like it was trying to sync with her somehow.  
明日香无能为力，它轻触她的心灵，仿佛她自己就是那台 EVA，试图以某种方式与她同步。

There was barely any resistance, there was nothing that she could do to stop it, she couldn't even slow it down.  
几乎没有遇到任何阻力，她无计可施，无法阻止它，甚至无法减缓它的步伐。

Then, from the red haze, a figure, no a face, yes a face. It was coming closer, but it was hazy, indistinguishable.  
随后，从那片红色迷雾中，一个身影，不，是一张脸，对，一张脸。它正逐渐靠近，但依旧模糊不清，难以辨认。

"Asuka." “明日香。”

The girl blinked. 女孩眨了眨眼。

She was solid again, she had a form, or at least the sensation of a form, but she was sitting in a yard, dusty and unkempt, she knew it well, but the whole scene was blurry, undefined like she was looking at it through running water.  
她再次变得真实，有了形态，或者说至少有了形态的感觉，但她正坐在一个院子里，尘土飞扬，杂乱无章，她对此地颇为熟悉，但整个场景却模糊不清，仿佛透过流动的水看过去一般。

"I don't want to remember." She whispered, but there was no one there to hear her.  
“我不想记起。”她低声说道，但那里并没有人在听她说话。

Instead, there was just that girl sitting alone, with a small bag in her lap, she couldn't have been more than four, maybe five.  
相反，只有一个女孩独自坐着，腿上放着一个小包，她看起来不过四五岁。

Those boys. 那些男孩。

Asuka could only watch as their blurry forms came towards her, snatching the bag of food away from the smaller redhead.  
明日香只能眼睁睁看着他们模糊的身影向她走来，从矮小的红发女孩手中夺走了那袋食物。

An exchange of words. 一番言语交锋。

Asuka couldn't have known what was said, it was so fuzzy, but she remembered the anger, it came so naturally, so effortlessly and before she knew it, the boy who had snatched the bag was on the ground.  
明日香不可能知道说了什么，声音太模糊了，但她记得那股怒火，来得如此自然，如此毫不费力，还没等她反应过来，那个抢包的男孩已经倒在了地上。

Around the two figures, red splatters began to appear, as her fists had swiftly broken the child's nose. It wasn't long before a much taller figure came, dragging the girl off the boy and away, blood still dripping from her fists in a trail behind her.  
在两个身影周围，红色的斑点开始出现，她的拳头迅速打断了孩子的鼻子。不久，一个高大的身影出现，把女孩从男孩身边拉开，血迹仍从她的拳头上滴落，留下一串痕迹。

"What about that girl?" “那个女孩怎么办？”

"Oh, she's a monster." "哦，她是个怪物。"

"She's mean." "她很刻薄。"

"Don't play with her, you'll get hurt."  
"别和她玩，你会受伤的。"

More tall figures walked throughout the yard amongst the smaller ones, while the redhead sat by herself, underneath a tree and just watched.  
高大的身影在较矮小的身影中穿梭于庭院，而红发女孩独自坐在树下，只是静静地观察着。

"What's her name?" “她叫什么名字？”

"Asuka." “明日香。”

"Why doesn't she play with the other children?"  
“她为什么不和其他孩子一起玩？”

"They're afraid of her." “他们怕她。”

"None of them want her."  
“没有人想要她。”

None of those strangers chose her, why would they?  
那些陌生人没有一个选择她，他们为何要选呢？

Not even her own parents wanted her.  
甚至连她的亲生父母也不想要她。

What was wrong with her?  
她到底哪里不对劲？

Days turned to weeks, weeks to months before they had come to take her away.  
日子一天天过去，周复一周，月复一月，直到他们终于来带走了她。

Special. 特别。

That was the word they used for her. Asking her if she wanted to do something special as well.  
他们用这个词来形容她。问她是否也想做一些特别的事情。

It hadn't been a hard decision, not with this place, not with these children running about.  
这并不是一个艰难的决定，有这个地方在，有这些孩子在周围奔跑。

"STOP IT!" "住手！"

The scene shattered, sprinkling into a million different shards as the red returned.  
场景破碎，化作无数碎片四散开来，红色再次回归。

"STOP, I DON'T NEED THOSE PAINFUL THINGS BROUGHT BACK UP, PLEASE JUST STOP IT!"  
"停下，我不需要那些痛苦的回忆被重新提起，请住手吧！"

The cold swirled as if it were listening, but it didn't retreat, it just crept closer.  
寒意盘旋，仿佛在聆听，却并未退却，只是悄然逼近。

"Asuka?" “明日香？”

It was a new place, one filled with machines and technology the small girl had never dreamt of before.  
这是一个全新的地方，充满了小女孩前所未见的机器与科技。

"Just hang in there, we're just doing some tests alright?"  
“坚持一下，我们只是在做些测试，好吗？”

The machines whined they scanned, they beeped in a cacophony of never-ending tests that filled her early days at NERV.  
机器们发出哀鸣，它们扫描，它们哔哔作响，在 NERV 的早期日子里，这些永无止境的测试声响充斥着她的每一天。

The simulations were what she lived for though.  
然而，模拟训练才是她真正向往的。

A whole world to escape to, a whole world where she towered over everything, where she could do anything.  
一个可以逃避的完整世界，一个她能凌驾于一切之上、随心所欲的世界。

The other children weren't as good as her, she could see that, hell a blind man could see that.  
其他孩子都不如她，她看得出来，瞎子都能看得出来。

The image swirled again, this time she was outside an office. The seven-year-old was listening, doing her best to peer through the cracked door.  
画面再次旋转，这次她站在一间办公室外。七岁的小女孩正侧耳倾听，尽力透过那扇裂开的门窥视。

"Your candidate is too aggressive."  
“你的候选人太咄咄逼人了。”

"She has scored in excess of at least ten percent over every other child brought in."  
"她的得分超过其他所有孩子的至少百分之十。"

"She's dangerous and unpredictable."  
"她既危险又难以预测。"

"I thought the whole point was for the pilot to be dangerous…"  
“我以为整个重点在于让飞行员变得危险……”

Asuka slunk away and again the scene changed.  
明日香悄悄溜走，场景再次变换。

"Here you go." “给你。”

The eight-year-old blinked.  
八岁的小孩眨了眨眼。

A doll? 一个玩偶？

"This is yours, happy birthday Asuka."  
“这是你的，祝明日香生日快乐。”

That woman, she wasn't too blurry, no, she remembered her. She wore glasses, sometimes she did tests, but most of the time the woman just watched all the candidates.  
那个女人，她并不模糊，不，她记得她。她戴着眼镜，有时会做测试，但大多数时候，这位女士只是观察所有的候选人。

Immediately the girl had written her name on it, bold and unmistakable. It was no one else's, it was hers.  
女孩一写下自己的名字，那字迹就大胆而清晰，无人能仿。这是她的，只属于她。

The cold darkness crept closer, Asuka felt it brush against her skin, and in that moment, she was no longer in Germany, she wasn't even in her plug suit.  
冰冷的黑暗悄然逼近，明日香感觉到它轻拂过她的肌肤，那一刻，她已不在德国，甚至不在插入栓内。

No, she was standing in a railyard, it was night, and what looked to be right after a light shower, with the damp ground and fog covering the area. The cool breeze caused her to shiver slightly, she was only wearing what she typically wore to bed, which didn't help very much.  
不，她站在一个铁路货场中，夜幕降临，似乎刚下过一场小雨，潮湿的地面和雾气笼罩着四周。凉风让她微微颤抖，她只穿着平时睡觉时的衣物，这并没有带来多少暖意。

She looked around, the gravel eating at her feet as she did. Before she heard the laughter, the soft feminine laughter that seemed to echo into a million voices.  
她环顾四周，碎石子啃噬着她的脚。在她听到笑声之前，那柔和的女性笑声似乎回荡成了无数个声音。

Spinning around, Asuka saw a cloaked figure there in the distance, only for the instant she stopped to squint, the girl found herself in a crowd of cloaked people, each running in the opposite direction, banging into her.  
阿斯卡转身望去，只见远处有一个披着斗篷的身影，但当她停下来眯眼细看时，发现自己置身于一群披着斗篷的人中间，他们朝相反方向奔跑，不断撞到她。

The cold once again surrounded her, it was starting to swallow her.  
寒冷再次包围了她，它开始吞噬她。

She was so cold. 她冷得要命。

Now she was sitting there, curled up, legs to her chest.  
此刻她正蜷缩在那里，双腿紧贴胸前。

There was nothing, there was no one, just the cold emptiness.  
四周空无一物，无人相伴，只有冰冷的孤寂。

No one to help her, no one to hold her, to protect her. She was alone.  
无人伸出援手，无人拥她入怀，无人守护她。她孤身一人。

Completely… alone. 完全……独自一人。

The cold returned, it was so close, encompassing her, choking her, there was nothing left for it to see. It promised to be kind, it promised her it could take away the pain.  
寒冷再次袭来，如此接近，包围着她，扼住她的喉咙，再无他物可寻。它承诺会温柔以待，承诺能带走她的痛苦。

It would be there for her always, it would accept her, it wanted her.  
它将永远陪伴她，接纳她，渴望她。

Again, the chill whispered to her, talked of her independence, there was no need for her to be around children anymore.  
又一次，寒意在她耳边低语，谈论着她的独立，她已无需再与孩子们为伍。

She was an adult. 她是个成年人了。

But Asuka was so cold.  
但明日香是如此冷漠。

It came closer, finally cutting her off from everything.  
它越来越近，最终将她与一切隔绝。

She wanted to scream. 她想要尖叫。

.

.

.

"Roter Drache…" “红龙……”

She looked out from behind her legs to see the shoes of someone, no… she knew that voice, it was so steady, so… alive. Asuka looked up at him, she looked at those dark blue eyes.  
她从腿后探出头，看到了某人的鞋子，不……她熟悉那个声音，那么沉稳，那么……充满生机。明日香抬头看向他，目光落在了那双深蓝色的眼睛上。

"What are you doing down there?" he asked with a smile.  
“你在那下面做什么呢？”他微笑着问道。

Suddenly that hand reached out to her, she just looked at it, looked at the outstretched arm of the boy who had done so much for her.  
突然间，那只手向她伸来，她只是凝视着它，凝视着那个为她付出如此之多的男孩伸出的手臂。

"Why?" she asked as the tears continued to fall silently.  
"为什么？" 她问道，泪水依旧无声地滑落。

That boy crouched down next to her, "Why?" he repeated the question, "Why what?"  
那个男孩蹲在她旁边，"为什么？" 他重复了问题，"为什么什么？"

"WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT WITH ME?!"  
"你到底想对我做什么？！"

The world changed, it was white now, she was seated on the blank surface, the same color stretching out towards infinity.  
世界变了，现在是一片洁白，她坐在空白的表面上，同样的颜色向着无限延伸。

Asuka looked around, now surrounded by three of them.  
明日香环顾四周，发现自己被他们三人包围了。

Shinji Ikari, standing there, a smile on his face and that Greek Cross hanging from his neck.  
碇真嗣站在那里，脸上挂着微笑，脖子上挂着那枚希腊十字架。

"_You don't seem like the kind that wants help…_  
"你看起来不像是需要帮助的那种人……

"_I thought you might want something more familiar for a change."_  
"我想你可能想换点更熟悉的东西。"

The Third Child, he was wearing a plug suit, his face was hardened, but his eyes were soft, for her they were inviting.  
第三适格者，他穿着插入栓服，面容坚毅，但眼神柔和，对她而言，那是邀请的目光。

"_Do you want me to stay here until they get you out?"_  
"你想让我留在这里直到他们把你救出去吗？"

"_Alright, I'm here."_ "好的，我在这里。"

Finally, a faceless boy, younger, with a defined outline, but nothing truly there, there were no discernible features, just the splattering of red that covered his chest.  
最终，一个面目模糊的男孩，更年轻，有着清晰的轮廓，但没有任何真实的特征，只有胸前那片溅满的红色。

"_I met someone, and I failed them… so completely."_  
"我遇到了一个人，我却让他们失望了……如此彻底。"

"…_no one helped me when I was… was like you…"_  
"……当我像你一样时，没有人帮助我……"

"Asuka…" "明日香……"

She looked back to the one in front of her, not the pilot nor the child, just him, just Shinji Ikari.  
她回头看向面前的他，不是驾驶员也不是孩子，只是他，只是碇真嗣。

He knelt down to her level; the edges of his lips curled slightly in an attempt to be warm.  
他跪下与她平视；嘴角微微上扬，试图显得亲切。

The boy said nothing else, he just held out his hand.  
男孩没有再说什么，只是伸出了手。

"_You're not alone Asuka._"  
"你并不孤单，明日香。"

"Why?" she asked again, curling up tighter "I'm not worth saving."  
"为什么？" 她再次问道，蜷缩得更紧了，"我不值得被救。"

There was no answer for her, he just inched closer.  
他没有回答，只是缓缓地靠近了些。

"Not even my parents wanted me, why do you!?" she shouted.  
"连我的父母都不要我，你为什么还要我！？" 她喊道。

"_It's not your fault."_ "这不是你的错。"

Her eye's widened at those words, remembering how he had whispered them in the dark to her. How he had reassured her and held her for the first time.  
听到这句话，她的眼睛睁大了，回想起他在黑暗中对她低语的情景。他是如何安慰她，第一次拥抱她。

"_It's not your fault."_ "这不是你的错。"

That anger came so naturally, Asuka couldn't keep herself from launching herself at him, fists clenched, as he landed on his back while brought her fist back and started to pummel his face.  
那愤怒来得如此自然，明日香无法抑制自己，猛地向他扑去，拳头紧握，他倒在地上，她收回拳头，开始猛击他的脸。

"Why?" "为什么？"

Again, there was no answer, just the sound of her landing blow after blow to his face.  
再次，没有回答，只有她一拳接一拳打在他脸上的声音。

"WHY ME!?" “为什么是我！？”

He was starting to bleed.  
他开始流血了。

"WHY DO YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE THIS!?"  
“你为何让我如此感受！？”

She stopped; the red gore dripped from her hands as her chest heaved from exhaustion.  
她顿住了；鲜红的血从她手中滴落，胸膛因疲惫而剧烈起伏。

Looking down at her shaking hands, Asuka steeled herself and slowly raised her gaze to look at the boy's face, to look at what she had done to him.  
看着自己颤抖的双手，明日香稳住心神，缓缓抬起目光，望向那男孩的脸庞，望向她对他所做的一切。

Where she expected a bloody pulp, she found the same warm smile she always knew, the one he always seemed to carry just for her.  
她本以为会看到一团血肉模糊，却发现了那个她始终熟悉的温暖微笑，那个他似乎总是只为她而展露的笑容。

She didn't know what to do, Asuka just jumped off him and ran into the emptiness. It felt like hours that she let her feet carry her, but she pushed on, away from the boy she always seemed to hurt.  
她不知道该怎么办，明日香只是从他身上跳开，跑进了空旷之中。仿佛过了好几个小时，她任由双脚带着自己奔跑，但仍不断前进，远离那个她似乎总是伤害的男孩。

Asuka ran until her legs couldn't carry her anymore. Collapsing onto her knees, the girl did her best to suck in all the air she could.  
明日香一直跑到双腿再也支撑不住。她跪倒在地，尽力吸入尽可能多的空气。

For a few moments she was alone again, she was away from anyone to hurt, and the cold came rushing back.  
有那么一会儿，她再次独自一人，远离了任何可能伤害的人，而寒冷也再次袭来。

At least, until she heard that voice again.  
至少，直到她再次听到那个声音。

"Still running?" “还在跑吗？”

She turned ever so slowly, there he was, his shirt was covered in his own blood, but he was fine, still holding that smile on his face.  
她缓缓转身，他就在那里，衬衫上沾满了自己的血迹，但他安然无恙，脸上依旧挂着那抹微笑。

Before she could make a move, before she could say a word, he just walked up to her kneeling figure and crouched down so that his face was level with hers.  
在她能有所动作之前，在她能吐露一言半语之前，他径直走向她跪着的身影，蹲下身来，让他的脸与她的齐平。

Their eyes were so close, their breath blew against each other's face, ticking her nose, those dark blue eyes… had she ever truly stared at them like this?  
他们的眼睛如此贴近，呼吸交织在彼此的脸上，轻拂过她的鼻尖，那深邃的蓝眸……她可曾如此真切地凝视过它们？

Then she felt it again, the cold coming, the emptiness surrounding her, clawing its way towards her.  
随后她再次感受到了，那寒意袭来，空虚环绕着她，步步紧逼，如利爪般向她袭来。

Before a new feeling was there.  
在新的感觉出现之前。

His arms wrapped around her, squeezing her in a reassuring embrace.  
他的双臂环绕着她，以一个令人安心的拥抱紧紧拥住她。

"_Asuka… I don't care, I don't care if you hurt me…"_  
“明日香……我不在乎，我不在乎你是否会伤害我……”

Asuka couldn't stop the flow of tears this time, no, it all came rushing out of her as she gripped his shirt, her fingers digging into his skin underneath like she was desperately trying not to drown.  
这次，明日香无法止住泪水，不，所有的情感都如潮水般涌出，她紧抓着他的衬衫，手指深深陷入他皮肤之下，仿佛在拼命挣扎着不让自己沉没。

The cold was there, trying its best to reach her again, but there was only his warmth, his life, it surrounded her, it held her.  
寒冷依旧试图再次侵袭她，但只有他的温暖，他的生命，环绕着她，拥抱着她。

It protected her. 它守护着她。

What was that cold emptiness next to him?  
他身旁那股冰冷的空虚是什么？

There was nothing it could offer her now, no whispers of comfort, no promises of shelter in solitude, there was no lie it could tell her that could make her grip loosen on his shirt.  
如今，它无法再给予她任何东西，没有低语的慰藉，没有孤独中庇护的承诺，没有任何谎言能让她的手从他的衬衫上松开。

"Why?" she asked him again, she knew, in her heart, she knew why he was doing this, but she just needed to hear it again.  
"为什么？" 她再次问他，她心里明白，她知道他为什么要这么做，但她就是需要再听一次。

"You know the answer." "你知道答案的。"

"I want to hear it again."  
"我想再听一遍。"

Shinji pulled away, Asuka thought he was going to let her go, so she gripped his shirt tighter, but he stopped. It seemed it was just so he could look her in the eye.  
真嗣拉开了距离，明日香以为他要放手了，于是更紧地抓住他的衬衫，但他停住了。看来他只是为了能直视她的眼睛。

She said nothing as he leaned in, his forehead resting against her own.  
他靠过来时，她一言不发，额头轻轻抵着她的。

_"Because you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen,"_ he said in a calm soothing tone, just above a whisper, not the near shout she remembered_, "Because you can be so alive sometimes because you make me feel alive, you're so fantastic that… I wish you could see yourself like I see you…"_  
“因为你是我见过的最美丽的女孩，”他用平静而抚慰的语调说道，声音仅略高于耳语，不再是她记忆中的近乎呐喊，“因为你有时如此充满活力，因为你让我感受到生命的活力，你是如此非凡……我真希望你能像我看到的那样看待自己……”

When he was finished talking, Asuka just collapsed, her head resting on his shoulder as his arms kept her upright. There was no strength left in her, there was no drive for anything other than the warmth she felt right there in that moment.  
当他结束谈话，明日香只是瘫倒下来，头靠在他的肩上，他的手臂支撑着她不倒下。她已筋疲力尽，除了那一刻感受到的温暖，再无任何动力去追求其他。

The redhead opened her eyes, even with him still there, a pit of dread worked its way into her stomach as a lone figure was now behind the two of them.  
红发女子睁开双眼，尽管他仍在身旁，一股恐惧的深渊却在她胃里蔓延开来，因为此时两人身后出现了一个孤零零的身影。

It was small, clearly a girl, but no face, there wasn't much of anything, only two black pits for eyes, and she knew what it was.  
它很小，显然是个女孩，但没有脸，几乎什么都没有，只有两个黑洞洞的眼窝，而她知道那是什么。

"_Soryu_." “惣流。”

That was his voice, that was him calling out to the mysterious girl in his sleep.  
那是他的声音，他在睡梦中呼唤着那位神秘的女孩。

The cold nothingness swirled in anticipation for her to let go of the boy, to reject his embrace. The idea of another girl occupying Shinji's thoughts almost making her do so.  
那冰冷的虚无在期待着她放开那个男孩，拒绝他的拥抱。另一个女孩占据着真嗣的心思，这几乎让她想要这么做。

But she held on. 但她坚持住了。

So what? Did he think she was that girl? No. If he did, he wouldn't have confessed to her, he wouldn't have told her about that great burden he carried.  
那又怎样？难道他认为她是那个女孩吗？不。如果他这么想，他就不会向她表白，不会告诉她他所背负的那份沉重负担。

He had trusted her not to leave him.  
他曾相信她不会离开他。

That's what he wanted, he wanted this too, Shinji didn't want to be alone.  
这就是他所渴望的，他也想要这样，真嗣不想独自一人。

Just like her. 就像她一样。

The cold recoiled and the mysterious figure evaporated, leaving the two of them there. Asuka couldn't have known how long it was, maybe minutes, maybe hours, she didn't care, not when this was so warm.  
寒意退去，神秘的身影消散无踪，留下他们两人。明日香不知道过了多久，或许是几分钟，或许是几小时，她不在乎，此刻如此温暖。

"Asuka?" “明日香？”

She grumbled something, her head still on his shoulder.  
她咕哝着什么，头依旧靠在他的肩上。

"Asuka, you need to get moving."  
“明日香，你得动起来了。”

"Huh?" she pulled back to look at him.  
"啊？" 她后退一步，抬头看他。

His head was tilted, while his hands moved down and into hers as their entangled fingers sat in between them.  
他的头微微倾斜，双手向下移动，与她的手指交缠在一起，他们的指尖在他们之间交织。

"_Promise me you won't catch yourself hating that redhead in the mirror… be happy… and if you cant do it for yourself, try to do it for me_."  
"答应我，你不会在镜子里讨厌那个红发的人……要快乐……如果不能为自己，那就试着为我这么做。"

"What are you talking about?"  
"你在说什么呢？"

"You have to go Asuka."  
"你得去，明日香。"

"I don't want to!" she shouted.  
"我不想去！" 她喊道。

"That's not something you get to choose." He was smiling again.  
“这不是你能选择的事。”他又微笑了起来。

Standing, Shinji brought the girl to her feet, hand in hand they stood there. Asuka couldn't think of anything to say, she'd rather not break the silence in fear of the moment ending.  
站起身来，真嗣将女孩扶起，两人手牵手站在那里。明日香想不出该说什么，她宁愿不去打破这份沉默，生怕这一刻就此结束。

"_Be happy_." "要快乐。"

Without warning the boy was no longer there, the great emptiness was gone.  
没有任何预兆，男孩突然消失了，那巨大的空虚也随之而去。

Instead, she was standing alone in a train car, an orange haze covering everything in sight.  
取而代之的是，她独自站在一节车厢里，眼前的一切都被橙色的雾霭笼罩。

She thought she was alone, at least until a voice broke the silence.  
她以为自己孤身一人，至少在声音打破寂静之前是如此。

"Did you find happiness in the outside world?"  
"你在外面的世界找到幸福了吗？"

**So, you thought we would just skip right to what Shinji gets up to after Bardiel did you? Well, not so fast haha.  
所以，你以为我们会直接跳到真嗣在巴迪尔事件后做了什么，对吧？哈哈，没那么快。**

**So… what if Shinji had been there for Asuka before Arael in NGE? Well, maybe this is what it would be like, or at least in a way it would be like this. Obviously painful memories were brought up and we get a bit of Shikinami's history, but we all know why we're here. Shinji's actions do have positive outcomes sometimes, even if he might never know it.  
那么……如果真嗣在《新世纪福音战士》中在亚拉尔之前就在明日香身边会怎样？嗯，也许会是这样，或者至少在某种程度上会是这样。显然，痛苦的记忆被唤起了，我们了解了一些式波的过去，但我们来这里的原因大家都知道。真嗣的行动有时确实会产生积极的结果，即使他可能永远不会知道。**

**SHOUTOUTS! 特别鸣谢！**

**tomdj1701 – As for how Asuka fared? Much better than what happened to her in NGE I'd say (at least mentally).  
tomdj1701 – 至于明日香的情况如何？我觉得比她在原版 EVA 中的遭遇要好得多（至少在心理上）。**

**spartanman2 – Thanks! There are more feels on the way! As for that comment…  
spartanman2 – 谢谢！更多情感戏份即将到来！至于那个评论……**

**EvaPilotFair – Well if you're in pain, I did what I set out to do!  
EvaPilotFair – 既然你感到痛苦，那我算是达成目标了！**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – Thanks!  
美利坚超旋 – 感谢！**

**MisterHalt – HAHA! Love it, as for that comment….  
哈尔先生 – 哈哈！太喜欢了，至于那个评论……**

**Iraki01 – Pls… yes… 伊拉基 01 – 请……是的……**

**skyf0x – Hope? Shinji's whole existence is built on hope to be honest. Hoping that this time around might just be different, so we'll keep struggling, because Shinji really doesn't know what else to do by now. I don't think Shinji would repeat his greatest mistake on purpose… but remember, I always said his previous knowledge would come back to haunt him…  
skyf0x – 希望？说实话，真嗣的整个存在都是建立在希望之上的。他希望这次可能会有所不同，所以我们继续奋斗，因为真嗣真的不知道现在还能做什么。我不认为真嗣会故意重复他最大的错误……但记住，我总是说他的先前知识会回来困扰他……**

**A Guy – Shinji: *snaps fingers* "You really want to test me?"  
A Guy – 真嗣：*打响指* "你真的想考验我？"**

**dyinglittelstar – Thanks! I admit I don't really have a knack for that type of thing, but it gets the job done.  
dyinglittelstar – 谢谢！我承认我不太擅长那种事情，但至少能完成任务。**

**Guest – I am cruel, but fair, haha.  
Guest – 我虽残忍，但公正，哈哈。**

**Duckz – Um, good, I think? Hopefully, we keep that up?  
Duckz – 嗯，挺好的，我想？希望我们能保持这样？**

**Berix – RIP Shikinami, Asuka, died as she lived, nah, Shinji for the assist, at least in her mind.  
Berix – RIP 式波，明日香，生如斯，死亦如斯，不，是真嗣助攻，至少在她心中如此。**

**Kempn200252 – ½ Asuka's injuries? Well, I don't think the entry plug fared any better, in fact, I thought I made it worse.  
Kempn200252 – ½ 明日香的伤害？嗯，我不认为驾驶舱的情况会好到哪里去，实际上，我觉得我可能还加剧了伤势。**

**2/2 I smiled when I read that, because it means I'm doing a good job, haha! More on that later.  
2/2 读到那段时我笑了，因为这意味着我做得不错，哈哈！更多内容稍后详述。**

**Alright, I wouldn't expect a chapter to be out in the next two weeks, I got some stuff going on, but afterwards we should be back to 2 a week if we're lucky.  
好吧，我不指望接下来两周内能看到chapter，我有些事情要处理，但之后如果我们幸运的话，应该能恢复到每周两更。**

**Until Next Time. 下次再会。**


### Chapter 32: "…What a mess we made, when it all went wrong …"  
Chapter 32: "…当一切出错时，我们搞得一团糟…"

Misato Katsuragi found herself slowly coming back to consciousness only to be greeted by the feeling of being moved, no carried on something.  
葛城美里缓缓恢复意识，却发现自己正被移动，或者说被某种东西承载着。

Opening her eyes cautiously, her mind finally acknowledged the sound of sirens, as her pupils picked up the flashes of red and blue all around her.  
她小心翼翼地睁开眼睛，脑海中终于捕捉到了警笛声，而她的瞳孔也捕捉到了周围闪烁的红蓝灯光。

She was distinctly aware of the bandages that seemed to cover her from head to toe and the sling that was now firmly over her left arm.  
她清晰地感觉到从头到脚缠满的绷带，以及牢牢固定在左臂上的吊带。

"I'm alive?" "我还活着？"

She had whispered that to no one in particular, maybe the universe, asking it why she had been fortunate enough to survive what had happened.  
她低声自语，并非对任何人，或许是对宇宙发问，为何她有幸能在那场灾难中幸存。

What exactly _had_ happened?  
究竟发生了什么？

She collected her thoughts, remembering how they had driven to the test site, how she had spoken with Asuka, and how once Uni-03 was activated, a blue signature had been acquired.  
她整理思绪，回想起他们是如何驱车前往测试地点，她与明日香交谈的情景，以及一旦 Uni-03 启动后，如何捕获了蓝色信号。

As the movement stopped, she felt herself being lowered, seeing now that she was on a stretcher that was being placed into the back of an ambulance, there was only one word that she could muster.  
当移动停止时，她感到自己被放下，现在她看到自己正躺在担架上，被抬进救护车的后部，她只能勉强说出唯一一个词。

"Kaji?" “加持？”

The man smiled as the others left, leaving only him to tend to her while waiting for the vehicle to start driving.  
那人微笑着，其他人离去，只留下他一人照料她，等待车辆启动。

"You're lucky, very lucky." The man stated as he fixed a bandage on her arm.  
“你很幸运，非常幸运。”那人一边说，一边为她手臂上的绷带打结。

Misato's mind did its best to formulate some sort of coherent sentence, but she could only manage one word.  
美里尽力在脑海中拼凑出一句连贯的话，但最终只能挤出一个词。

"Asuka?" “明日香？”

Kaji didn't turn to meet her eye, she wasn't sure if he could even manage that right now.  
加治没有转头看她，她不确定他现在是否还能做到这一点。

"Kaji, where's Asuka?" “加治，明日香在哪儿？”

The man just closed his eyes and his hands stopped, she wasn't sure, but they might have been shaking slightly.  
男人只是闭上了眼睛，他的手停了下来，她不确定，但它们可能微微颤抖着。

"Unit-03… was dealt with as an Angel…. by Unit-01."  
"零三号机…被当作使徒…由零一号机处理掉了。"

"_Do you have anyone like that Misato? Someone who just listens to you and makes you feel warm?"_  
"美里，你有这样的人吗？一个只是倾听你，让你感到温暖的人？"

No. 不。

Misato grunted as she tried to push herself up, but was met with strong hands that needed little effort to keep her there.  
美里闷哼一声，试图起身，却被一双强有力的手轻易按住，无法动弹。

"No… let me go Kaji… I need to…" she was stammering, she needed to do something.  
"不…放开我，加持…我必须…"她结结巴巴地说着，她需要做些什么。"

"You _need_ to lay back down Katsuragi, you can't do anything." He assured her.  
"你需要躺回去，葛城，你现在什么都做不了。" 他向她保证道。

"But… I can't lose another…" Misato did her best to choke out through labored breathing, "What about Shinji?"  
"但是……我不能再失去另一个了……" 美里尽力在艰难的呼吸中挤出话来，"那真嗣怎么办？"

Again, Kaji turned away from her, unable to meet her eyes.  
又一次，加持转过身去，无法直视她的眼睛。

"Something… happened…" “发生了……一些事……”

ʡʘʘʢ

The Colonel gawked at the bustling bodies that crowded the NERV medical wing. She had never seen so many personnel wounded or treating patients.  
上校目瞪口呆地看着挤满 NERV 医疗翼的忙碌身影。她从未见过这么多受伤的人员或治疗病人的场景。

She figured NERV wanted to question all those who had survived the initial blast, keeping them under one proverbial roof allowed them to do that much more efficiently, but with this amount of influx…  
她猜想 NERV 想要审问所有在最初爆炸中幸存下来的人，将他们集中在一处可以更有效地进行审讯，但面对如此大规模的人员涌入……

Well, it seemed the lobby had been set up as a makeshift triage center, with a mass of wounded on stretchers or sitting down while covered in bandages. She really hadn't gotten a good look as her own cart had been pushed through the lobby and into one of the rooms deeper in the facility.  
嗯，看来大厅已被临时改造成了急救中心，众多伤员躺在担架上或坐着，全身裹满绷带。她之前并未仔细观察，因为自己的推车也被迅速穿过大厅，推进了设施深处的一间房内。

Stopping, her head rolled to the side only to see a bushel of blonde hair.  
她停下脚步，头转向一旁，映入眼帘的是一束金灿灿的头发。

"Rits?" "立花？"

The blonde groaned and looked over at her. A rather large red and blackish spot was forming on her head and Misato could only guess it hadn't come from what had transpired at the test site.  
金发女子呻吟着，转头看向她。她头上正逐渐形成一块相当大的红黑色斑块，美里只能猜测这并非来自测试现场发生的事。

"What happened to you?" "你发生了什么事？"

Again, the doctor groaned at her voice.  
医生再次因她的声音而呻吟。

"That little bastard…" she mumbled as she reached over and picked up an ice pack.  
"那个小混蛋……" 她喃喃自语，伸手拿起一个冰袋。

"What?" “什么？”

"Shinji, he did this…" "真嗣，是他干的……"

Katsuragi raised an eyebrow, what the hell did that mean? How could he have done that? Ironically if that was true then it meant that Shinji was at least healthy enough to be moving about and hurting people.  
葛城皱起眉头，这到底是什么意思？他怎么可能做到？讽刺的是，如果这是真的，那就意味着真嗣至少身体状况良好，能够四处走动并伤害他人。

Instead of pressing further, her mind moved to her other ward.  
她没有继续追问，而是想到了她的另一个被监护人。

"Asuka... what happened?" she asked as she pushed herself upright.  
“明日香...发生了什么？”她一边问，一边努力坐直身子。

Swinging her legs over the side of the cart, she looked around for any nurses that might object to her movements, but they were alone.  
她将双腿从推车边上摆下来，环顾四周寻找可能反对她行动的护士，但她们周围空无一人。

"Rits, Asuka…" she pried again, but the doctor was still not cooperating.  
“理津子，明日香…”她再次追问，但医生依旧没有回应。

"What about her?" she bit back.  
"她怎么了？" 她反唇相讥。

"How is she?" "她怎么样了？"

The blonde just rolled her eyes, obviously not wanting to have this conversation.  
金发女子只是翻了个白眼，显然不想进行这个话题。

"The girl's side had more in common with ground beef…"  
女孩那边的脸颊更像是一团碎牛肉……

SMACK 啪

Misato couldn't help herself, and she was definitely regretting that slap afterward. Not because of the pain Ritsuko must have been in, but instead the pain her own wounds were giving her in protest to her action.  
美里忍不住动手了，事后她确实为此感到后悔。不是因为丽素可能承受的疼痛，而是她自己的伤口因这一举动而抗议，让她感到痛苦。

Hurrying out of the room, the colonel's mind began to think of where they would have put the redhead, Ritsuko didn't have time to respond to the rapidly swelling cheek.  
匆匆走出房间，上校的脑海中开始思索他们会把红发的理津子安置在何处，而理津子没有时间回应那迅速肿起的脸颊。

Quarantine. 隔离区。

That word brought back the unpleasant memory of what happened after the Fourth Angel, but Misato knew where to go.  
这个词唤起了第四使徒事件后的不愉快记忆，但美里知道该去哪里。

She had to see her.  
她必须见到她。

ʡʘʘʢ

As Misato entered, she noted how quiet it was in the observation room, apart from the hum of the computer fans and the occasional beep, there was dead silence.  
当美里进入时，她注意到观察室里异常安静，除了电脑风扇的嗡嗡声和偶尔的哔哔声外，一片死寂。

She also noted the bloodstain on the ground in the middle of the room.  
她还注意到了房间中央地上的血迹。

Moving to the window, the woman peered down into the room. A single slab rested in a pool of LCL, with ten angel sealing hex pillars surrounding it.  
女子走向窗边，俯视着房间。一块石板静卧在 LCL 液池中，周围环绕着十根封印天使的六角柱。

There, thrown down unceremoniously like a piece of meat, she could clearly make out the hair of Asuka, but not much more.  
在那里，像一块肉一样被随意丢弃，她能清楚地看到明日香的发丝，但除此之外几乎无法辨认更多。

The girl was entirely enclosed in a sarcophagus of wires and tubes as if that were the only thing keeping her body together.  
女孩完全被包裹在一个由电线和管子构成的石棺中，仿佛那些正是维系她身体的唯一之物。

Misato forced herself to look, after all, she was only up here, Shinji…  
美里强忍着不去看，毕竟，她只是在这里，真嗣……

Shinji was down there at the girl's side.  
真嗣就在那女孩的身旁。

Resting at the edge of the slab by the girl's left, Shinji sat there, just staring at what could barely be distinguished as the girl.  
坐在女孩左侧石板的边缘，真嗣只是呆呆地凝视着那勉强能辨认出是女孩的身影。

The woman felt her heart break just that bit more at the sight. They had obviously been close. Closer than even Asuka had let on, maybe the two had even found a bit of peace.  
看到这一幕，女子感到自己的心又碎了几分。他们显然关系密切。或许比明日香透露的还要亲密，也许两人甚至找到了一丝安宁。

Now… she doubted either of them would find that peace again.  
如今……她怀疑他们俩再也无法找回那份安宁了。

Even if Asuka survived. 即使明日香幸存下来。

She prepared herself, clearing her throat and trying to steady her voice.  
她做好准备，清了清喉咙，试图稳定自己的声音。

"Shinji?" “真嗣？”

The boy didn't look up; he wouldn't look away from her.  
男孩没有抬头；他的目光始终不曾从她身上移开。

"Shinji look at me." "真嗣，看着我。"

He said nothing for the longest moment, before she heard his voice, barely a whisper.  
他沉默了许久，她才听到他的声音，几乎细不可闻。

"It's not your fault Misato."  
"这不是你的错，美里。"

There was a pause before she could say anything.  
她顿了顿，才开口说话。

"It's not your fault either Shinji, get out of there, we can't have you contaminated too."  
“真嗣，这也不是你的错，快离开那里，我们不能让你也受到污染。”

He laughed, somehow it sounded genuine.  
他笑了，不知怎的，听起来很真诚。

"I should have realized; I should have done something… this is my fault." He mumbled; his voice barely being picked up by the microphones inside the containment area.  
"我早该意识到的；我本该做些什么的……这都是我的错。" 他喃喃自语，声音几乎被收容区内的麦克风捕捉不到。

He finally tore his eyes away from the redhead and gazed up at her, "Don't worry about me, worry about the next Angel."  
他终于将目光从红发女孩身上移开，抬头望向她，"别担心我，担心下一个使徒吧。"

"Shinji what do you know?"  
"真嗣，你知道些什么？"

Her eyes could barely make out a soft smile that spread on his lips before he looked back at the steady breaths of the redhead on the slab.  
她的眼睛勉强捕捉到他唇边缓缓展开的一抹微笑，随后他又将目光转回躺在石板上红发女子平稳的呼吸上。

The colonel knew then that she wouldn't get anything else out of him. He was fixated on his fellow pilot, with only the steady sound of the ventilator to keep him company.  
上校那时便明白，她无法从他口中再得到更多信息。他全神贯注于他的飞行员同伴，唯有呼吸机的稳定声响陪伴着他。

"Shinji, that girl you told Kaji about…" she started, Misato wasn't sure if it was wise to reveal Kaji's betrayal of trust, but he needed to hear this.  
“真嗣，你跟加持提到过的那个女孩……”她开口道，美里不确定揭露加持的背叛是否明智，但他需要听到这些。

"Asuka isn't her, this wasn't your fault."  
"明日香不是她，这不是你的错。"

Down below, the boy made no notion that he heard her, instead he just sat there.  
下方，男孩没有任何反应，只是静静地坐在那里。

Misato couldn't have known how wrong she was.  
美里根本不知道自己错得有多离谱。

His mind drifted back to what had transpired just a few hours earlier and what a mess he had made.  
他的思绪飘回到了仅仅几个小时前发生的事情，以及自己搞得多么一团糟。

ʡʘʘʢ

"You would have been killed!"  
“你差点就没命了！”

That was Makoto, Shinji was sure, but that didn't matter right now.  
那是真琴的声音，真嗣确信，但眼下这并不重要。

"That's not the point!" Shinji shouted back, quieting the command center, they couldn't know that meant nothing to him, to him, dying was the easy part.  
“那不是重点！” 真嗣回喊道，让指挥中心安静下来，他们不知道这对他来说毫无意义，对他而言，死亡反而是简单的部分。

"You… you tried to use me… you tried to use me to hurt her…"  
“你……你试图利用我……你试图利用我来伤害她……”

Another shockwave rang through the command center.  
指挥中心再次传来一阵冲击波。

"And I won't let that go!"  
"我绝不会让那事过去！"

Down below no one said a word, they simply looked up to the commander for his directive.  
下方无人言语，他们只是抬头望向指挥官，等待他的指示。

"I thought for one moment, one tiny moment that you could be better, that you could be just one degree better…"  
有那么一瞬间，仅仅是一刹那，我以为你能变得更好，以为你能再好上那么一分……

Gendo Ikari stared at the screen, even down here in the lowest depths of the GeoFront, he had felt the shocks Eva Unit-01 had caused.  
碇源堂凝视着屏幕，即便身处地底最深处，他仍能感受到初号机引发的震动。

This was just a child having a temper tantrum, nothing more.  
这不过是个孩子在发脾气，仅此而已。

But then again… 但话说回来……

Another shockwave and more dust fell on his shoulders.  
又一阵冲击波袭来，更多的灰尘落在了他的肩上。

…he wasn't behaving like he thought he would.  
……他的行为并不像他预想的那样。

"DO YOU HEAR ME, YOU ARROGANT OLD PRICK!"  
“你听见没有，你这傲慢的老混蛋！”

He peered at the screen before him, EVA Unit-01's towering purple mass stood atop the pyramid.  
他凝视着面前的屏幕，EVA 初号机那庞大的紫色身影矗立在金字塔顶端。

Up above, Shinji knew he should back down, he knew that he should see Asuka, he knew that this was not helpful.  
在高处，真嗣知道他应该退缩，他知道他应该去见明日香，他知道这样做无济于事。

But he didn't care. 但他不在乎。

"Shinji listen to me…" "真嗣，听我说……"

"Shut up, dumbass!" Came a snarling voice.  
"闭嘴，蠢货！" 一个咆哮的声音传来。

"Gendo…" That voice, Gendo's heart stopped, it was cold, cruel, calculating, but more importantly steady.  
"源堂……" 那个声音，让源堂的心脏骤停，它冷酷、残忍、算计满满，但更重要的是，它平稳有力。

It eerily reminded him of his own voice.  
这声音诡异地让他想起了自己的嗓音。

At last, he had to admit, this was not some 14-year old's tantrum.  
最终，他不得不承认，这并非某个 14 岁少年的无理取闹。

"Increase the LCL pressure, I've had enough of this." He commanded.  
“增加 LCL 压力，我受够了。”他命令道。

A few button presses, it should be simple, but…  
只需按几下按钮，应该很简单，但……

"Unit-01's LCL pressure regulator isn't responding."  
初号机的 LCL 压力调节器没有反应。

Useless. 没用的。

Then came the laughter. 随后笑声响起。

It was the same laugh that he had heard Shinji with his fight against Unit-03, but there was no humor, no life behind it.  
那笑声与他曾在真嗣对抗三号机时听到的一模一样，但其中没有幽默，没有生命力。

It was a dead laugh.  
那是一种死寂的笑声。

"You think, I'd fall for that," Another stomp, another shake.  
"你以为我会上当吗？" 又是一脚跺下，再次摇晃。

"I'm going to put Unit-01 back, and then I'm going to wait."  
"我要把初号机放回去，然后我会等着。"

Gendo couldn't keep himself from responding, the bit about his mother intrigued him too much.  
碇源堂忍不住回应，关于他母亲的那部分让他太过好奇。

"Wait for what Shinji? You will be surrounded and arrested the moment you step foot outside that Eva."  
"等什么，真嗣？你一踏出那台 Eva，就会被包围并逮捕。"

"When the next Angel comes, you'll fail, no EVA's left, no Pilots, only me and Unit-01." He explained. "All I want is three words. An apology… because I know it's going to be the hardest thing you've ever done."  
"下次使徒来袭时，你会失败的，没有 Eva 了，没有驾驶员，只剩下我和 01 号机。"" 他解释道，""我想要的只是三个字。一个道歉……因为我知道这将是你做过的最艰难的事。"

Gendo simply watched the Evangelion return to the cages, his mind not even registering Fuyutsuki's words as he watched the purple behemoth turn away.  
源堂只是静静地看着福音战士返回笼中，他的心思甚至没有注意到冬月的言语，只是注视着那紫色巨人转身离去。

ʡʘʘʢ

Yui? 唯？

He was back in the cages now, the Evangelion charging as he sat there, and all the while a small army of security was amassing outside his entry plug.  
他现在又回到了笼子里，福音战士正在充能，而他坐在驾驶舱内，与此同时，一小队安保人员正在他的插入栓外集结。

They would have to wait.  
他们不得不等待。

Yui? 唯？

That same consciousness deep within the core stirred, but as he reached out to it, it scurried away, now frightened by the boy.  
那深藏核心的意识微微一动，但当他试图触及它时，它却惊慌失措地逃开了，如今被这少年吓到了。

Shinji sighed but understood. After something like that, how could she ever want to sync with him again?  
真嗣叹了口气，但心中了然。经历了那样的事，她怎会还想再与他同步呢？

Perhaps… there was a solution though.  
或许……还是有解决办法的。

It was only fair that he showed her the truth.  
他向她展示真相，这很公平。

Deciding on his course of action, Shinji's presence backed down from trying to reach out, and instead he began to slowly lift the guise around himself.  
决定了自己的行动方针后，真嗣不再试图接近，而是开始慢慢揭开自己周围的伪装。

Yui's presence stopped fleeing and instead seemed to 'watch' at a distance while the boy seemed to unravel the barriers that had spared her of all his sorrows and pain.  
Yui 的意识停止了逃离，似乎在远处'观察'着，而男孩似乎正在解开那些曾让她免受他所有悲伤和痛苦影响的屏障。

'Do you want to know who I am?'  
“你想知道我是谁吗？”

He was sure she would want to know, after all, she should recognize him as vaguely being like her son.  
他确信她会想知道，毕竟，她应该能隐约认出他像自己的儿子。

Slowly her essence reached back out, swirling slowly and brushing against his own, seemingly ready for the onslaught of emotions.  
渐渐地，她的本质再次伸出触角，缓缓旋转并轻拂着他的，似乎已准备好迎接情感的冲击。

"_What are you stupid?"_ “你是不是傻？”

"_The Human Instrumentality Project."_  
“人类补完计划。”

"_Help me Asuka!"_ “救救我，明日香！”

"_No."_ "不。"

"_Running away didn't help anything."_  
"逃跑解决不了任何问题。"

"_Disgusting."_ "恶心。"

Yui didn't turn away, her soul didn't flee, she peered into his own, allowing his emotions and memories to wash over her like a tsunami.  
优并未逃避，她的灵魂没有退缩，她凝视着他的内心，任由他的情感和记忆如海啸般席卷而来。

He held nothing back, letting her sift through his thoughts, letting her see everything, he let her _feel_ everything.  
他毫无保留，任由她翻阅他的思绪，让她看到一切，他让她感受到一切。

"_I couldn't save them; I couldn't save anyone."_  
“我救不了他们；我谁也救不了。”

"_I won't leave you alone again."_  
“我不会再让你孤单一人。”

"_You didn't leave."_ "你没离开。"

"_I don't deserve it."_ "我不配拥有。"

_"I'm yours Asuka, all of me. I promise. I'll always be there… I'm yours."  
"我是你的，明日香，全部的我。我保证。我会一直在那里……我是你的。"_

When had he said that?  
他何时说过那句话？

Yui stopped, having submersed herself in his being, and come back.  
结衣停了下来，沉浸在他的存在中，然后回来了。

For a moment there was nothing, no notion that she had ever seen those things, no violent outburst at the boy who had pretended to be her son… before he felt it.  
有那么一刻，什么都没有，没有意识到她曾经见过那些东西，没有对那个假装是她儿子的男孩的激烈爆发……直到他感受到了。

She lunged at him. 她猛地向他扑去。

He expected to be almost attacked, for Unit-01 to go berserk and his piloting to cease completely in one fell swoop.  
他本以为会遭到近乎攻击，初号机狂暴失控，他的驾驶也会在一瞬间彻底停止。

Instead, another feeling washed over him. Warmth. He knew exactly what this was, an embrace, a hug, her soul doing its best to envelop him in her love and protection as much as she could.  
然而，另一种感觉涌上心头。温暖。他清楚地知道这是什么，一个拥抱，她的灵魂竭尽全力将他包裹在她的爱与保护之中。

The sensors and microphones had all been shut down, there was no way for anyone outside of that entry plug to see what happened next.  
传感器和麦克风都已被关闭，没有任何人能从外部看到接下来发生的事情。

The boy's legs curled to his chest as the repeated flashes of warmth flowed over him, as Yui's presence swirled around him in an attempt to comfort him.  
男孩的双腿蜷缩至胸前，随着温暖的感觉一次次涌遍全身，Yui 的存在在他周围盘旋，试图给予他安慰。

Her child… torn apart and put back together how many times?  
她的孩子……被撕裂又重新拼凑了多少次？

He felt that emotion, and there was nothing he could do in that moment to hold back the tears. No matter how little he thought of the woman, no matter how little he trusted her…  
他感受到了那种情绪，那一刻他无法抑制泪水。无论他对这个女人有多少轻视，无论他对她有多少不信任……

She was still, in some way at least, his mother.  
至少在某种程度上，她仍然是他的母亲。

So, he just let the tears flow, and let the euphoria of the moment wash over him for just a little while.  
于是，他任由泪水流淌，让那一刻的狂喜短暂地淹没自己。

ʡʘʘʢ

He was damp with LCL, the taste and smell as he pushed it out of his lungs had been annoying even after a few lifetimes, but now, there was nothing but the anger that he felt.  
他浑身湿透，LCL 的气味和味道在他将之排出肺部时依旧令人不快，即便经历了多次生命轮回，但现在，他只感到愤怒。

There was no crew for him, no waiting patrons, only a rifle pointed at his head.  
没有船员，没有等待的顾客，只有一把枪指着他的头。

In fact, there were plenty of rifles trained on his head.  
事实上，有好几支步枪正瞄准着他的脑袋。

Death by firing squad, been there, done that.  
枪决？那不过是老生常谈。

"Shinji Ikari, you are under arrest for terroristic threats, insubordination, and treason."  
“碇真嗣，你因涉嫌恐怖威胁、违抗命令及叛国罪被捕。”

A guard moved towards him with pair of handcuffs, but his arms remained at his sides.  
一名警卫拿着一副手铐朝他走来，但他双臂依旧垂在身侧。

He moved slowly, cautiously.  
他缓慢而谨慎地移动着。

"I wouldn't do that if I were you." He mumbled.  
“如果我是你，就不会那么做。”他咕哝道。

Behind him, Unit-01 growled in accordance, the rumbling of thousands of tons of armor and flesh rocked the catwalk they stood on, he looked at the guards and he saw fear growing in each of their faces.  
在他身后，初号机发出低沉的咆哮，数千吨重的装甲与血肉之躯的震动撼动了他们所站的通道，他望向守卫们，看到恐惧在每个人的脸上逐渐蔓延。

ʡʘʘʢ

"What do you mean it's still activated?"  
"你什么意思，它还在激活状态？"

Fukyusiki noted the tone of the man's voice. Gendo wasn't one to emote surprise often and it was rarely with his son, but when the guards sent to arrest him reported that the Evangelion was responding to him even outside the Entry Plug, his brain worked in overtime.  
福吉式注意到这个男人的语气。源堂不常表现出惊讶，更少在他儿子面前，但当负责逮捕他的卫兵报告说，即使不在插入栓内，福音战士依然对他有反应时，他的大脑开始高速运转。

"Is he still there?" Gendo asked the officer.  
"他还在那里吗？"源堂问那位军官。

"No sir, we're following him to quarantine, he said he's going to see someone… and sir…"  
"不，长官，我们正跟着他去隔离区，他说他要去看某个人……还有，长官……"

"What is it?" "什么事？"

"He stole a sidearm from one of our men."  
"他从我们的人那里偷了一把配枪。"

A silence came over them as the frown on the man's face simply deepened.  
随着男人脸上的皱眉愈发加深，一阵沉默笼罩了他们。

"Very well." “很好。”

Gendo turned to the technicians, as each awaited command from him.  
源度转向技术人员，他们各自等待着他的指令。

"Have the MAGI predict his course and lock down the passageways towards Quarantine."  
"让 MAGI 预测他的路线，并封锁通往隔离区的通道。"

All three turned to their terminals and began furiously typing away, but all soon turned back to him, each wearing a look of perplexion on their faces.  
三人齐齐转向各自的终端，开始疯狂地敲打键盘，但很快又都转回来看向他，每个人的脸上都带着困惑的表情。

"The MAGI are refusing the commands." The female technician reported.  
"MAGI 拒绝执行命令。" 女技术员报告道。"

"They're reporting no activity in those areas like the Third Child isn't even there!"  
"他们报告说那些区域没有任何活动，就好像第三适格者根本不在那儿一样！"

Gendo said nothing, he just sat there, while neither of them said a word.  
碇源堂一言不发，只是坐在那里，两人之间一片沉默。

ʡʘʘʢ

Quarantine, it was procedure, and as he walked, images tore through his brain like a progressive knife, images of her body broken, twisted, mutilated.  
隔离，这是程序，而他行走间，脑海中如利刃般一幕幕闪现，她的身躯破碎、扭曲、残缺。

Each and every time he had failed her, only to be left clutching her body… that was if he was lucky.  
每一次他都未能护她周全，只能紧抱她残破的躯体……如果他足够幸运的话。

How many last breaths did he have to hear, how many unsaid words were left tearing into him?  
他还要听多少次她的临终呼吸，还有多少未尽之言在撕扯他的心？

How many dead eyes did he have to look into?  
他得直视多少双死寂的眼睛？

His accompanying guards marched a distance behind him, not daring to incur the wrath of the still revolting Unit-01 back in the cages.  
随行的警卫们远远跟在他身后，不敢招惹那仍处于暴走状态的零一号机，它正被关在笼子里。

They had no way of knowing it was a bluff. All he had done was ask Yui to put on a show every so often, especially when he had gotten out of the entry plug.  
他们无从知晓这只是个幌子。他不过是让 Yui 时不时上演一出戏，尤其是在他离开插入栓之后。

Even he couldn't control an Evangelion from the outside like a certain red-eyed boy.  
即便是他也无法像某个红眼少年那样，从外部控制一台 EVA。

Shinji did his best to steady his breathing, but the images of himself tear into her, causing her so much pain through the Evangelion, even with what he did, what little he did, it was painful to his core.  
真嗣尽力平稳呼吸，但那些关于自己的影像撕裂着她，通过 EVA 给她带来如此剧烈的痛苦，即便他做了些什么，哪怕只是微不足道的事，也让他心如刀绞。

_Unit-03's hands squeezed his throat  
三号机的双手扼住了他的喉咙_

It was so fitting, like poetry, he was willing to let it happen, he was willing to let her kill him if that meant sparing her pain.  
这一切如此契合，宛如诗篇，他愿意让它发生，愿意让她杀了他，如果这意味着能减轻她的痛苦。

And didn't hurt him to admit that, not one bit.  
承认这一点并不让他感到痛苦，一点儿也不。

Finally, to the quarantine ward, he found it almost empty, why wouldn't it be? There was only a need for one room to be occupied.  
最终，他来到了隔离病房，发现这里几乎空无一人，这又有什么奇怪的呢？只需要一个房间有人住就够了。

It was an observation room he entered, not the entrance to her chamber.  
他进入的是一间观察室，而非通往她房间的入口。

Ritsuko. 律子。

She stood there, around her other doctors all worked at the controls while she applied bandages to her head, she had been talking to someone when he walked in.  
她站在那里，周围的其他医生都在控制台前忙碌，而她则在给头部缠上绷带，他走进来时，她正和某人交谈着。

It was all he needed to hear.  
仅此一句，他已心领神会。

"…she's a valuable specimen."  
“……她是个珍贵的样本。”

'Specimen' '样本'

Shinji barely knew how he got her down on the ground in an instant, how this 14-year-old body had been able to manage it was beyond him, but there she was with his pistol to her head.  
真嗣几乎不知道他是如何在瞬间将她按倒在地的，这个 14 岁的身体是如何做到的，他无法理解，但她就在那里，他的手枪抵在她的头上。

She called Asuka a 'specimen'.  
她称明日香为'样本'。

"Why?" He growled out, "为什么？" 他咆哮道，

Ritsuko for the life of her, couldn't even think clearly she had been taken completely by surprise. This boy shouldn't be capable of this, why did he care so much for the Second Child?  
理津子无论如何都无法清晰思考，她完全被惊呆了。这个男孩不应该能做到这种程度，他为何如此关心二号机驾驶员？

"Why what?" she asked, trying to remain calm, panic still spreading through her voice.  
"什么为什么？" 她问道，试图保持冷静，但恐慌仍从她的声音中蔓延开来。

"Professor!" One of the technicians yelled, the other doctors were useless, they didn't know what to do.  
“教授！”一名技术员喊道，其他医生都束手无策，他们不知道该怎么办。

"NO! Get out!" Ritsuko yelled to the guards, who now had their weapons still trained on the boy.  
“不！出去！”律子对着守卫们吼道，他们现在仍然将武器对准了那个男孩。

"Get. Out." She pleaded, looking into the guards' eyes,  
“出去。”她恳求道，目光直视着守卫们的眼睛，

Slowly, the guards lowered their weapons, step by step they backed out, bringing along with them everyone who had been inside.  
慢慢地，守卫们放下了武器，一步一步地后退，带着所有原本在里面的人一起离开。

As the door closed, the doctor was suddenly very aware of the pistol against her forehead as he pressed it harder against it.  
随着门关闭，医生突然非常意识到枪口紧贴着她的额头，他更加用力地压了压。

"Why Asuka? It should have been Toji!"  
“为什么是明日香？本该是真嗣的！”

In that instant, his face was contorted with rage and she believed him, she believed that he would pull that trigger over that girl.  
就在那一刻，他的脸因愤怒而扭曲，她相信了他，她相信他会为了那个女孩扣下扳机。

"Toji wasn't needed, we had a pilot." The doctor pleaded.  
“东治并不需要，我们已经有驾驶员了。”医生恳求道。

"No! Asuka wouldn't have been compatible with Unit-03."  
“不！明日香不可能与三号机兼容。”

"Why would you think that?" She asked quietly yet incredulously. He was sure she was wondering how he knew that how he was so sure that Asuka would be incompatible with Unit-03.  
“你为什么会这么想？”她轻声却难以置信地问道。他确信她在疑惑他是如何知道这一点，又是如何如此肯定明日香与三号机不兼容的。

"Was it you?" "是你吗？"

"What?" “什么？”

"Did you ask Asuka to pilot Unit-03?!"  
"是你让明日香驾驶三号机吗？！"

She was quiet for a moment before she spoke up. "It was Misato." She admitted quietly.  
她沉默了一会儿，然后开口道：“是美里。”她轻声承认。

The boy's eyes extinguished, not completely but enough that she wasn't sure she was going to die.  
男孩的目光黯淡下来，虽未完全熄灭，但已让她不确定自己是否会死去。

"Let me in there." He demanded.  
"让我进去。" 他要求道。

"You can't, it's…" "你不能，这里……"

"Too dangerous?" He asked, he was smiling "you people have no idea..." he stopped, closing his eyes for a moment.  
"太危险了？" 他问道，脸上带着微笑，"你们这些人根本不知道..." 他顿了顿，闭上眼睛片刻。

"You people don't even know how to help her." He finished.  
"你们甚至不知道如何帮助她。" 他结束了这句话。

With that, Shinji raised the muzzle off the woman's head and brought the butt of the grip back down with enough force to knock the woman out and leave a considerable amount of blood dripping from her head onto the floor.  
说完，真嗣将枪口从女人头上移开，用枪托猛地一击，足以将她击晕，并让大量鲜血从她头上滴落到地板上。

He pulled himself up and off her while plucking the keycard off her coat.  
他一边从她身上爬起，一边从她的外套上取下钥匙卡。

Swiping and entering the door on the far side of the room, Shinji walked down the stairwell and found himself inside an airlock.  
刷卡进入房间另一侧的门后，真嗣走下楼梯，发现自己进入了一个气闸室。

After stepping inside, Shinji waited as the door shut behind him and the air was cycled. While he waited for the second door to open all he had was a small window all he had to keep his eyes on her.  
踏入舱内后，真嗣等待着身后的门关闭并完成空气循环。在等待第二道门开启的间隙，他唯一能做的就是透过那扇小窗凝视着她。

With a pneumatic hiss, the door opened and out he stepped out into the knee-high LCL that had filled the room.  
随着一声气动嘶鸣，门打开了，他踏出一步，进入了充满房间的齐膝深 LCL 液体中。

"Look at what they did to you." He mumbled to himself.  
“看看他们对你做了什么。”他喃喃自语。

Wires reached up around the glorified slab they had dumped her on, each ensnaring her and confining her like each was providing her a tether to the mortal plane.  
电线环绕着他们将她丢弃的那块光鲜的平板，每根都缠绕着她，像是在为她提供与凡间相连的羁绊，将她束缚。

Look what _I_ did to you.  
看看我对你做了什么。

She almost reminded him of a sarcophagus, if it weren't for the constant sound of mechanical breathing from the ventilator and red hair, he wouldn't have even known it was her.  
她几乎让他想起了石棺，要不是呼吸机持续的机械呼吸声和那一头红发，他甚至认不出是她。

He wanted to strangle someone, exact his revenge in the cruelest way imaginable, leave someone begging for their life and terrified just like she must have been.  
他想掐死某个人，以最残忍的方式复仇，让某人乞求生命，恐惧万分，就像她当时一定经历的那样。

Who? Ritsuko? She wasn't even the one to ask Asuka…  
谁？律子？她甚至都不是问明日香的那个人……

Misato? She had only asked Asuka, and he was sure she was going to feel guilty about this as well, but she couldn't have known.  
美里？她只问了明日香，而他确信她也会对此感到内疚，但她不可能知道。

Gendo? Not this time, he still ordered the ejection of the plug, he had done something, even if he tried to use the dummy plug on him.  
源堂？这次不是他，他仍然下令弹出插入栓，他做了些什么，即使他试图用替身插头来蒙混过关。

In the end, he came to the same old conclusion.  
最终，他得出了那个老生常谈的结论。

Of all the parties, he was the only one who could be truly blamed.  
在所有相关者中，他是唯一一个真正该受责备的人。

He knew Unit-03 would be compromised, he was even _willing_ to let Toji pilot it, driven by his confidence to keep him from being hurt, but Asuka… had he known she was asked…  
他知道三号机可能会出问题，他甚至愿意让冬治去驾驶，因为他自信能保护他不受伤，但明日香……如果他早知道她会被安排……

He would have told her, argued with her, kidnapped her, he would have destroyed Unit-03 or piloted it himself before letting her do that.  
他本会告诉她，与她争论，甚至绑架她，他宁愿摧毁零三号机或亲自驾驶，也不愿让她去冒那个险。

He would have told her the _truth_ if it meant keeping her out of that Evangelion.  
如果这意味着能让她远离那台福音战士，他本会向她吐露真相。

But that didn't matter now.  
但如今这已无关紧要。

Because she was all but chained here to this slab and he was responsible for her pain.  
因为她几乎是被锁在这块石板上，而他正是造成她痛苦的罪魁祸首。

Again. 又一次。

"_Remember the first time you stood over me like this? Remember what you did?" came a half-amused remark from the redhead._  
“还记得你第一次像这样站在我上方吗？记得你做了什么吗？”红发女子半开玩笑地说道。

_She was standing there, resting against the wall, but he didn't rise to the bait, he just didn't have the energy. A fact she seemed to pick up on when he didn't respond.  
她站在那里，倚靠着墙壁，但他并未上钩，只是真的没有那份精力。她似乎察觉到了这一点，因为他没有回应。_

He should have let her choke him.  
他本该让她掐住自己的。

She should kill me. 她应该杀了我。

She should make me suffer.  
她本该让我受苦的。

Didn't she already though?  
难道她不是已经这样做了吗？

He sat down on her left side, _that_ memory wasn't vivid here, even with the reminder he had just received.  
他在她的左侧坐下，那段记忆在这里并不鲜明，即便刚刚才被提醒过。

Here he was, this was the best shot he had, the best life he had been given to work with in so long and he blew it.  
此刻他站在这里，这是他最好的机会，是这么久以来他得到的最美好的生活，而他却搞砸了。

The emptiness he felt inside was nearly unbearable.  
他内心的空虚几乎难以忍受。

"Drache…" He breathed. “龙啊……”他轻声叹息。

Looking down, Asuka's hand had been bandaged, while being uncovered by the rest of the apparatus encasing her. The boy let his left hand reach down, gently pressing against her palm.  
低头望去，明日香的手已被绷带包扎，而其余部分则被装置所覆盖。少年伸出左手，轻轻按在她的掌心。

He began to tap that familiar tune he had come to learn over so many lives. If there was one thing he could do for her, perhaps this was it.  
他开始敲击那首在无数次生命中逐渐熟悉的曲调。如果说有什么能为她做的，或许这就是了。

Shinji could've never known how right he was.  
真嗣永远也不会知道他有多么正确。

**So… I may have taken an extra week off… To be fair, I could barely stand to look at Word after writing essays for nearly 48 hours straight. So here we are, hope that wasn't too edgy. Shinji and a gun REALLY don't go well together, but it just kinda formed this way. After all, why wouldn't they just arrest him when he steps away from Unit-01 and who didn't enjoy Ritsuko getting hit by two people this chapter? Just a few more chapters till the main break, but we'll get there when we get there, hopefully by the end of July.  
所以……我可能多请了一周假……公平地说，在连续近 48 小时写论文后，我几乎无法直视 Word 文档。所以，我们又回来了，希望这不会显得太突兀。真嗣和枪真的不搭，但故事就这样发展了。毕竟，当他离开初号机时，他们为什么不直接逮捕他呢？还有谁不喜欢看到律子被两个人同时击中呢？chapter 主剧情的高潮部分还有几章就要到了，但我们会在适当的时候到达那里，希望能在七月底之前。**

### Chapter 33: "…To fill the empty spaces …"  
Chapter 33: "…填补那些空白之处…"

"Did you find happiness in the outside world?"  
"你在外面的世界找到幸福了吗？"

Asuka blinked. 明日香眨了眨眼。

She was seated in a train car, an orange haze covering everything. Twisting her head, she looked behind her only to see a railyard slowly passing by.  
她坐在一节火车车厢里，四周被橙色的光晕笼罩。她扭头向后看去，只见一个铁路货场缓缓掠过。

Looking over herself, Asuka noted how she was suddenly in her school uniform, the blue and white being washed out by the orange glow that seemed to cover everything. In her hand rested her trusty WunderSwan, how long had it been since she turned it on?  
环顾自身，明日香注意到自己突然换上了校服，蓝白相间的色彩在似乎覆盖一切的橙色光芒中显得黯淡。手中握着她信赖的 WunderSwan，她已经有多久没有开机了？

"You're always playing with that, aren't you?"  
“你总是在玩那个，对吧？”

Asuka looked up only to see… Ayanami?  
明日香抬头一看，只见……绫波？

She was sure the outline matched the girl, but the light from behind her washed out all features of her face.  
她确信那轮廓与女孩相符，但背后的光线却将她面部的所有特征都冲淡了。

"Pilot Ikari used to always listen to his player… is it the same for you?"  
“碇司令以前总是听从他的驾驶员……对你也是这样吗？”

"Is what the same for me?" she bit back.  
“什么对你也是这样？”她反唇相讥。

"Do you wish to close off yourself to the world you hate?"  
"你希望将自己封闭在你所憎恨的世界之外吗？"

Did she hate the world? Of course, she did, what had it ever done for her? Why should she even protect it? The only reason she was doing that in the first place was to pilot the Eva… now that was gone.  
她憎恨这个世界吗？当然，她恨，这个世界对她做过什么？她为什么要保护它？她最初这么做的原因只是为了驾驶 Eva……现在连这个也失去了。

She was about to retort the girl with all those things but was cut short. The girl's side exploded in pain, it was like fire, spreading and burning her insides, burning to her bones, though despite the sheer magnitude of that pain it was nothing compared to her left eye.  
她正准备用这些话反驳那个女孩，却被打断了。女孩的侧身突然爆发出剧痛，如同烈火，蔓延并灼烧她的内脏，直透骨髓，尽管这痛苦无比剧烈，但与她的左眼相比，却显得微不足道。

Asuka could help but let a small yelp escape her as she felt it, but just as it washed over her it receded, leaving the girl winded, and clutching the left side of her head.  
明日香忍不住发出一声小小的惊叫，当她感受到那股力量时，但就在它席卷而过之后，它又退去了，留下女孩喘息着，紧抓着自己的左侧头部。

"Don't you judge me!" Asuka barked back at the girl, still breathing heavily "You're just a doll, I bet you can't even feel anything!"  
"别评判我！"明日香对女孩咆哮道，依旧喘息未定，"你不过是个玩偶，我敢打赌你什么都感觉不到！"

"So, you have the ability to feel those things, but do you want to?" that monotone voice asked, seemingly not caring about the girl's adverse reaction.  
"所以，你能感受到那些东西，但你想要感受吗？"那个单调的声音问道，似乎并不在意女孩的负面反应。

Again, that shooting pain ran through her eye and side, only to leave her as quickly as it came.  
又一次，那刺痛穿透了她的眼睛和侧边，却又如出现时那般迅速消失。

"Yes." "是的。"

Is that what she wanted her to admit?  
这就是她希望她承认的吗？

More than anything, she had wanted to feel, she wanted to live, she wanted to feel warm. Asuka hadn't thought that possible until recently, until _him_.  
她比任何时候都渴望感受，渴望生活，渴望温暖。直到最近，直到遇见他，明日香才觉得这有可能实现。

"You're lucky," The girl responded in the same monotone voice "he understands you."  
"你真幸运，" 女孩用同样的单调声音回应，"他理解你。"

"Of course he does! He…"  
"当然他理解！他……"

_Tap 轻敲_

Asuka's anger evaporated instantaneously.  
明日香的怒气瞬间消散了。

_Tap tap 咚咚_

Was that… a beat? 那是……一个节拍吗？

_Tap tap tap 咚咚咚_

She looked down at her palm… she felt it. That tune he had shared with her, that they had played together that night.  
她低头看着自己的手掌……她感受到了。那首他曾与她分享的旋律，那个夜晚他们共同演奏的曲子。

The room melted, slowly, warping and disappearing, like it was being washed away, as she felt the pain began to take hold of her again as her view turned black, but it didn't retreat, it didn't even slow down, it encompassed her entire body now.  
房间渐渐融化，扭曲并消失，仿佛被冲刷殆尽，当她感到痛苦再次袭来，视线变得漆黑，但痛苦并未退却，甚至没有减缓，此刻已完全吞噬了她的全身。

Asuka wanted to scream, but it felt like there was something keeping her from doing just that, something clogging her throat. There were muffled sounds, someone trying to talk, but it sounded as if she were underwater. There was something on her, something weighing her down.  
明日香想要尖叫，却感觉有什么东西阻止了她，仿佛喉咙被堵塞。耳边传来模糊的声音，有人在试图说话，但听起来就像她置身水下。有什么东西压在她身上，沉重得让她动弹不得。

She struggled, thrashing against whatever was keeping her there, as much as her clouded mind could. Then she felt it, the tapping had stopped, replaced by someone holding her hand.  
她挣扎着，竭尽所能地用她那混沌的头脑对抗着束缚她的东西。随后，她感受到了变化，那轻敲停止了，取而代之的是有人握住了她的手。

Asuka knew exactly who it was.  
明日香清楚地知道那是谁。

It took every bit of strength she had to force her left hand to twitch, to move, to do something to squeeze back, to let him know she could feel him. In the end, she wasn't able to tell if she did, the pain was blinding, but Asuka could feel herself calming down, despite the confusion.  
她用尽全身力气，强迫自己的左手抽搐，移动，做些什么来回应，让他知道她能感觉到他。最终，她无法确定自己是否做到了，疼痛让人目眩，但尽管如此，明日香能感觉到自己正在平静下来，尽管心中一片混乱。

Because Shinji was there.  
因为真嗣在那里。

He hadn't left her. 他没有离开她。

She felt something rushing into her veins, something freezing, spreading through her body as her mind began to cloud even more.  
她感到某种冰冷的东西涌入血管，迅速蔓延全身，意识也随之愈发模糊。

The dark emptiness that she could see melted away, back to the orange hue of the train car.  
她眼前那片黑暗的空虚逐渐消融，回到了列车车厢内橙黄的色调。

The redhead looked down at her hand, the feeling was still there, but she was sure it was just a memory at this point… still, she flexed her hand bringing it into a fist.  
红发女孩低头看着自己的手，那种感觉依旧存在，但她确信此刻不过是记忆的残留……尽管如此，她还是握紧了拳头，活动了一下手指。

"Do you deserve him?" the small creature asked.  
"你配得上他吗？"小生物问道。

She closed her eyes. 她闭上了眼睛。

"No," she admitted, she wasn't sure if it was to herself or that creature.  
"不，"她承认道，不确定这话是对自己说的，还是对那生物说的。

"I want… I _need_ to deserve him," She opened her eyes, "but he doesn't care, he just wants me to be happy."  
"我想要……我需要配得上他，" 她睁开眼睛，"但他不在乎，他只希望我快乐。"

"Is that enough?" the small blue-haired girl asked.  
"这样就够了吗？" 那位蓝发的小女孩问道。"

She just smiled and hoped the train ride wasn't going to be much longer.  
她只是微笑着，希望火车之旅不会太漫长。

"It has to be." “必须是这样。”

There were no more words, the two of them just sat there, eyeing each other, at least there were no words from the person in front of her.  
没有更多的言语，两人只是坐在那里，互相凝视，至少她面前的人没有说话。

Instead, Asuka heard them, like a whisper from someone who wasn't there.  
相反，明日香听到了它们，就像来自某个不存在的人的低语。

"_I'll be right back…"_ "我马上回来……"

ʡʘʘʢ

He sat there at her side, taping the tune.  
他坐在她身边，敲打着旋律。

How long had he been there? Without any clocks or windows to the outside world, it was hard to tell.  
他在那里待了多久？没有钟表，也没有通向外面的窗户，很难说清楚。

It wasn't like he was going anywhere anyway.  
反正他也没打算去哪儿。

Somehow, this was worse than his nightmares. There they could be over abruptly, there he already knew how things went, here… he was left with no clear direction to go.  
不知为何，这比他的噩梦还要糟糕。在梦里，一切可以突然结束，他已知晓事情的走向，而在这里……他完全迷失了方向，没有明确的目标。

He knew for sure this was worse than letting her die, she was suffering, even if she was in a coma, or simply had an ungodly amount of an anesthetics, he knew there would be permanent damage. From what he could tell, she hadn't lost limbs like Toji had, but he couldn't know for sure.  
他确信这比让她死去更糟糕，她在受苦，即便她处于昏迷状态，或是被注射了大量麻醉剂，他知道会有永久性的伤害。据他所知，她没有像真嗣那样失去肢体，但他无法确定。

It wasn't like they might amputate them if they were too damaged either.  
也不像如果损坏太严重就会被截肢那样。

Now all he could do was sit here, trying to comfort her if she was aware, trying to help her if her mind was damaged.  
现在他只能坐在这里，如果她还有意识就尽力安慰她，如果她心智受损就尽力帮助她。

He was one to talk.  
他也好意思说。

_YOUR FAULT 你的错_

Shinji didn't fight that feeling.  
真嗣没有抗拒那种感觉。

He was selfish. 他很自私。

He wanted to feel happy.  
他想要感到快乐。

He was willfully blind to the obvious.  
他故意对显而易见的事实视而不见。

Look where that got him.  
看看这把他带到了哪里。

_I am poison to everyone around me.  
我是周围所有人的毒药。_

How true that had been.  
那话真是千真万确。

"_And who told you it first? Who said you were going to regret trying to pretend to be something you're not?" Asuka barked from the side of the room._  
“谁最先告诉你的？谁说你会后悔试图假装成不是自己的样子？”明日香从房间的一侧厉声说道。

He didn't acknowledge it, he had more pressing matters.  
他没有承认，他有更紧迫的事情要处理。

Like how Asuka's hand had twitched on its own.  
比如明日香的手是如何自己抽搐的。

Shinji stopped his tapping, only able to look on in horror as the encased girl began to move.  
真嗣停止了敲打，只能惊恐地看着被封在里面的女孩开始动弹。

At first, it was quivering, then it escalated. She thrashed against her restraints, the wires and tubes moving with her, threatening to tear out and do even more damage.  
起初，她只是微微颤抖，随后愈演愈烈。她拼命挣扎着，身上的电线和管子随着她的动作摇摆，仿佛随时会脱落并造成更大的伤害。

The boy was sure that up in the observation room doctors would be shouting and people working furiously to sedate her again. While down here, he was once again completely useless to the girl.  
男孩确信，在上方的观察室里，医生们一定在大声呼喊，人们正疯狂地工作试图再次让她镇静下来。而在下面，他又一次对女孩无能为力。

So, he just held her hand.  
于是，他只是握住了她的手。

He squeezed it as Asuka shook, trying to move, probably terrified and confused at what was happening.  
他紧握着她的手，而明日香颤抖着试图移动，可能既害怕又困惑于正在发生的事情。

"It's alright Asuka." He said trying to comfort her, trying to say anything that might help, despite his doubt she would hear him. He squeezed her hand slightly tighter, while not wanting to hurt the already damaged girl.  
“没事的，明日香。”他试图安慰她，尽管怀疑她是否能听见，仍尽力说出任何可能有所帮助的话。他稍微更紧地握了握她的手，同时又不愿伤害这个已经受伤的女孩。

The mass of wires, tubes, and hair seemed to respond to it, as he could feel her own hand squeeze back, even if it was the lightest of pressure.  
那堆电线、管子和头发似乎对此有所反应，他能感觉到她的手轻轻回握，尽管压力微乎其微。

"I'm here Asuka, it's alright." He said gently, doing his best to try and calm the confused girl.  
“我在这里，Asuka，没事的。”他温柔地说道，尽力安抚这位困惑的女孩。

It all seemed to end so quickly, her body began to relax more and more, the pressure he felt on his hand began to lessen and finally, her fingers went slack. The anastatic must've set in and she was finally back under.  
一切似乎结束得如此迅速，她的身体逐渐放松，他感受到手上的压力开始减轻，最终，她的手指松懈下来。麻醉剂一定生效了，她终于再次陷入沉睡。

Despite his whole body screaming that he should let go of her, that he had just caused the girl even more suffering, he didn't budge.  
尽管全身都在尖叫着让他放开她，告诉他刚刚给这女孩带来了更多痛苦，他却没有动摇。

_I made a promise. 我许下了承诺。_

So, he just sat there, hand in hand with the girl, knowing that he would eventually need to leave her. Zeruel would likely come next, hopefully.  
于是，他就那样坐着，与女孩手牵手，明知终将需要离开她。接下来可能是 Zeruel，希望如此。

If that wasn't the case, then all bets were off.  
如果不是这样，那么一切赌注都作废了。

He knelt down in the LCL, resting his head on the slab while keeping his hand in hers, he was pretty sure that he wouldn't fall off and it wasn't like he could drown in the stuff.  
他跪在 LCL 中，将头靠在石板上，同时手仍握着她的手，他很确定自己不会掉下去，而且也不可能在这种液体中溺水。

Shinji let himself drift off to sleep, deciding it was best to be well-rested for the fight that was about to come.  
真嗣让自己渐渐入睡，决定为即将到来的战斗养精蓄锐。

ʡʘʘʢ

Rei Ayanami's apartment was silent.  
绫波零的公寓一片寂静。

The blue-haired girl was used to that, it wasn't like she was accustomed to many disturbances, but now… somehow it seemed so quiet.  
蓝发女孩对此早已习以为常，她并不常被干扰，但此刻……不知为何，一切显得如此寂静。

The girl closed the door behind her and looked over the kitchen counter, reviewing the pile of food that was now ruined from hours of sitting out.  
女孩关上身后的门，环视着厨房台面，审视着因长时间放置而变质的食物堆。

Methodically emptying each dish that had been used, Rei went about wiping down the countertop and placing each dish into the sink. Turning to the main room, she stopped in the doorway, an unfamiliar feeling stirring inside her.  
有条不紊地清理着用过的每道菜，丽开始擦拭台面，并将每个盘子放入水槽。转身走向主房间时，她在门口停下，心中涌起一种陌生的感觉。

The girl just looked at the table sitting there, dishes and drinks still out waiting in vain to be eaten.  
女孩只是看着那张桌子，盘子和饮料依旧摆在那里，徒劳地等待着被享用。

The image of both sitting there, in such close proximity…  
两人坐在那里的画面，如此近的距离……

Something manifested itself in her stomach, it felt heavy, like there was a pit where it shouldn't be.  
她的胃里似乎生出了某种感觉，沉重得像是不该有的深渊。

She had been in Unit-00 when the Third Child had engaged the Angel, she had been privy to a video feed so that if Unit-01 should fail, she would at least know what she was facing. She would've needed that edge, considering the damaged state of Unit-00.  
当第三适格者与使徒交战时，她正身处零号机内，通过视频直播密切关注战况，以防万一初号机失利，她至少能了解自己将面对什么。考虑到零号机的受损状态，她确实需要这一优势。

Her hands worked methodically, taking the liquids to the sinks, and pouring them out.  
她的双手有条不紊地操作着，将那些液体带到水槽边，一一倾倒。

Heading back to the table, her eyes were caught by something. Stopping, she just looked at the Third Child's bookbag leaning against her wall.  
回到桌边，她的目光被某物吸引。停下脚步，她只是凝视着三儿子的书包斜靠在墙边。

"…_you should have just left me where I was…"_  
"…你本该就让我留在原地…"

The boy's comments at dinner had floated back into her mind as well as what was said during the battle.  
晚餐时男孩的话再次浮现在她脑海中，还有战斗中所说的一切。

_"You, you think you can just make me kill her again?"  
"你，你以为你能让我再次杀了她吗？"_

The boy had never hid the fact he despised piloting the Evangelions, even if he had seemed resigned to them as of late.  
那男孩从未隐瞒过他对驾驶 EVA 的厌恶，尽管最近他似乎已经对此认命了。

Stopping her cleaning, the girl knelt down and looked inside the bag, eyeing the laptop and books for class, she pulled out one of the notebooks stored inside.  
女孩停止了打扫，跪下来向包内看去，目光扫过笔记本电脑和课本，她从里面抽出了一本笔记本。

It seemed brand new on the outside like she had just purchased it from a store. Opening it, her eyebrows raised at the blank pages, flipping through them, all of the pages were blank.  
从外观上看，它似乎崭新得像是刚从商店买来的一样。打开后，她看到空白页时眉头一挑，翻阅着，每一页都是空白的。

In fact, every notebook in the bag was blank.  
事实上，包里的每本笔记本都是空白的。

How did the Third Child take notes?  
第三适格者是怎么记笔记的？

Peering deeper inside, she spotted the familiar sight of an SDAT player.  
她再往里仔细一看，发现了熟悉的 SDAT 播放器。

Picking it up, she examined it, wondering what songs the commander's song could've listened to.  
她拿起它，仔细端详，好奇指挥官生前会听些什么曲子。

She straightened one of the earbuds and placed it in her ear. However, just before she could press play, her door burst open.  
她调整好一只耳机，塞进耳朵。然而，就在她准备按下播放键之前，房门突然被撞开了。

A sense of déjà vu came over her, as Section 2 agents began to hurry her away.  
一种似曾相识的感觉涌上心头，第二区的特工们开始匆忙地将她带走。

ʡʘʘʢ

_He felt like he was back on that beach again, sitting next to her.  
他感觉自己仿佛又回到了那片海滩，坐在她身旁。_

_What had that really felt like?  
那究竟是一种怎样的感觉呢？_

_Was he the same boy that had his hands wrapped around her neck?  
他还是那个双手环抱她脖子的男孩吗？_

_He remembered his tears. 他记得自己的泪水。_

_He remembered her caress.  
他记得她的抚摸。_

"_Disgusting."_ "恶心。"

_He remembered how that word had been said with such venom, such hatred.  
他记得那个词是如何被带着如此的恶意，如此的憎恨说出来的。_

_And he knew she was right; he was disgusting, and he remembered that he deserved ever bit of her ire.  
他知道她是对的；他令人作呕，他记得自己活该承受她所有的怒火。_

_How long had they laid there? Did he remember the sunrise? Was there a sunrise?  
他们在那里躺了多久？他记得日出吗？有过日出吗？_

_It was all so fuzzy, so blurry, he_ should _remember. He_ knew _he remembered._  
一切都那么模糊，那么朦胧，他本该记得。他知道自己记得。

_It was like blinking, and he was back with the crashing of the public telephone line.  
仿佛只是眨眼间，他便随着公用电话线的轰鸣声回到了现实。_

_And a Rei standing off in the distance for the third time.  
而第三次，丽站在远处。_

_No. 不。_

_That was wrong, what was missing?  
这不对劲，少了些什么？_

_Why did he have such a hard time remembering? Was it that long ago?  
为什么他记起来这么困难？难道那是很久以前的事了吗？_

_There was something else… what was it… he knew there was something.  
还有别的什么……是什么来着……他知道还有些事情。_

_He knew there was more… but why did it feel like he was just watching… static?  
他知道还有更多……但为什么感觉就像在看……静止画面？_

_Shinji needed to remember.  
真嗣需要记住。_

The Third Children's eyes opened as the chamber shook.  
第三适格者的眼睛随着舱室的震动睁开了。

ʡʘʘʢ

This felt wrong. 这感觉不对劲。

Misato just stood there, the box in her hands as the Section 2 agents who had escorted her home closed the door behind her.  
美里只是站在那里，手中的盒子随着第二课特工们护送她回家后关上的门，静静地在她手中。

The apartment was dead. 公寓里死寂一片。

Her home was lifeless. 她的家毫无生气。

All the color and joy she had known over the last few months had been siphoned from it.  
过去几个月里她所熟悉的色彩与欢乐已被抽离。

This felt wrong. 这感觉不对劲。

The colonel looked down at the box in her hands. Asuka still lived with her, which meant all recovered items were sent back with the woman.  
上校低头看着手中的盒子。明日香还和她住在一起，这意味着所有找回的物品都会随她一同归还。

Somehow, it felt much too heavy for the few items inside.  
不知为何，它对于里面的几样物品来说显得过于沉重。

She set it down on the kitchen table, her one arm still in a sling, and just pulled out a chair.  
她将其放在厨房桌上，一只手臂仍吊着绷带，只是拉出一把椅子坐下。

Sitting there, she noticed the lack of dishes. Shinji must've not eaten much for breakfast and it seemed like he didn't make anything for lunch either. The thought of the angel interrupting Rei's dinner party meant the boy hadn't eaten nearly anything all day.  
坐在那里，她注意到餐具的缺失。真嗣早餐一定没吃多少，而且似乎连午餐也没准备。想到使徒打断了绫波的晚餐聚会，这意味着男孩一整天几乎没吃什么东西。

The woman rubbed her eyes, here she was thinking like a mother again, worrying about him.  
女人揉了揉眼睛，她又像母亲一样思考，担心起他来。

She froze. She _was_ like a mother to him, to both of them, whether she liked it or not she was the only figure in their lives that even remotely filled that role.  
她愣住了。她对他，对他们俩来说，无论她是否愿意，都是他们生活中唯一一个勉强扮演这一角色的人。

And there was nothing she could do now, for either of them  
她现在无能为力，无论是为了谁。

In that train of thought, she hadn't bothered to notice a certain penguin come out to see her. It nudged against her leg, looking up at her, wondering why he had been alone for so long.  
在这样的思绪中，她没有注意到一只企鹅走了出来，来到她身边。它用身体蹭了蹭她的腿，抬头望着她，好奇为什么自己被独自留了这么久。

"I guess you want something to eat?" she asked, composing herself.  
“我想你是饿了？”她问道，努力让自己镇定下来。

The bird purred in agreement, as she went about looking for a bit of food, for the both of them.  
鸟儿发出咕噜声表示同意，她便开始为两人寻找一些食物。

Placing food on the floor Misato sat back down at the table, suddenly not wanting to eat. Instead, she found her eyelids begin to droop. They seemed to grow heavier until finally, she found herself drifting off to sleep right there.  
将食物放在地板上，美里重新坐回桌前，突然间没了食欲。取而代之的是，她感到眼皮开始沉重起来，仿佛越来越沉，直到最终，她就在那里不知不觉地陷入了梦乡。

The sudden ringing of her phone brought her back to consciousness. Reaching into her coat, she flipped open her phone and brought it up to her ear.  
手机的突然响起将她从恍惚中拉回现实。她伸手探入外套，翻开手机盖，将其举至耳边。

"This is Katsuragi…" “这里是桂木……”

ʡʘʘʢ

The chamber shook as he felt the first strike from the Angel.  
随着使徒的第一击落下，房间开始震动。

"The Angel of Might cometh." He mumbled to himself.  
“力量天使降临了。”他喃喃自语道。

Shinji pushed his head off the slab and just looked down at the girl. Just as before, the only sound between them was the rhythm of the air being forced into her lungs.  
真嗣将他的头从石板上推开，只是低头看着那个女孩。和之前一样，他们之间唯一的声响是她肺部强迫吸入空气的节奏。

Pressing his cufflink, the plugsuit went slack around him. Reaching up around his neck, Shinji pulled off the pendant he had carried for so long.  
按下袖扣，插入栓服在他周围松弛下来。真嗣伸手绕到脖颈处，取下了他长久以来一直佩戴的吊坠。

Holding it in his hand, he refit the suit and reached down to Asuka's hand.  
他手持着它，重新穿上外套，然后俯身握住明日香的手。

Entangling the string in her fingers, he tied it off, making sure it was just tight enough that it couldn't fall off easily.  
他将细绳缠绕在她的手指上，系紧，确保它足够紧实，不易脱落。

Shinji closed her fingers around the Greek cross and leaned down to her ear.  
真嗣将希腊十字架放入她的掌心，合上她的手指，然后俯身贴近她的耳畔。

"I'll be right back, and you can give this back to me, alright?"  
"我马上回来，你可以把这个还给我，好吗？"

**Ah, the good old train scene. I wouldn't have done that for Asuka since we already had the Bardiel/Arael-esc, scene if not for one important fact. Toji finds himself in a traincar in NGE and he even can see Shinji with 'Rei'.  
啊，经典的火车场景。如果不是因为一个重要的事实，我不会为明日香做这个，毕竟我们已经有了巴迪尔/亚拉尔式的场景。在 EVA 中，剑介发现自己在一节火车车厢里，甚至还能看到‘绫波’和真嗣。**

### Chapter 34: "…'Cause I'm all alone again…"  
Chapter 34: "…'因为我又一次孤身一人…"

Somewhere among the piles of wiring, solder boards, and scrounged computer parts, the girl's phone rang and that feeling once again found itself settling in her stomach.  
在那一堆堆的电线、焊板和捡来的电脑零件中，女孩的手机响了，那种感觉再次在她胃里沉淀下来。

Mari had been waiting for it to ring, ever since she had received the briefing on what had transpired with the 9th Angel, she knew it would only be a matter of time for her to be called to action. She just never expected it to be so soon.  
自从玛丽收到关于第九使徒事件的简报后，她就一直在等待电话响起，她知道被召唤行动只是时间问题。只是她从未料到会这么快。

Having pushed small screwdrivers and tweezers aside she answered, only to be told the situation.  
她将小螺丝刀和镊子推到一旁，接起电话，却被告知了情况。

Those two familiar feelings ran through her stomach again. The same feelings she had known during the action at Bethany Base.  
那两种熟悉的情绪再次涌上她的心头。正是她在贝瑟尼基地行动时所感受到的。

Excitement. 兴奋之情。

The chance to finally pilot a production EVA. The thrill that battle had always given her was intoxicating, the adrenalin that pumped through her heart was something that nothing else in her life could provide.  
终于有机会驾驶量产型 EVA。战斗带给她的那种刺激感令人陶醉，那种让心脏狂跳的肾上腺素，是生活中其他任何事物都无法提供的。

Fear. 恐惧。

The dance with death was always so frightful. One wrong step and she could lose her life. One wrong decision and hundreds, if not thousands of people could die.  
与死神的共舞总是如此可怕。一步走错，她可能就会丧命。一个错误的决定，数百甚至数千人可能会死去。

The girl knew after the very first time she felt that hypergolic mixture, that she would be addicted to the sensation all her life.  
女孩在第一次感受到那种自燃混合物时就知道，她将终生沉迷于那种感觉。

Because it made her feel alive.  
因为它让她感到自己真正活着。

It wasn't long after the call that IPEA agents had come for her and with one silent, yet insanely fast car ride later through the barren streets of Tokyo-03 the girl spotted a familiar scruffy man waiting for her.  
电话挂断不久，IPEA 特工便来接她，经过一段无声却异常迅速的车程，穿越东京-03 荒凉的街道后，女孩看到了一个熟悉的邋遢男子在等她。

By the time they had gotten to the long-term storage facility, Kaji had briefed her on the situation. The 10th Angel, rapidly approaching Tokyo-03, and how it seemed to disregard even the largest munitions thrown at it.  
当他们抵达长期存储设施时，加持已经向她简要说明了情况。第 10 使徒正迅速逼近东京-03，似乎对投向它的最大型武器都视若无睹。

Stopping in front of a doorway, the man turned to her. "This is it, they'll have Unit-02 reactivated in a few minutes." He explained.  
在门前停下，男子转向她。“就是这里，他们几分钟内就会重新激活二号机。”他解释道。

"Right now, you'll be the only operation Unit we have, don't forget what it means if you fail." He reminded her with a low yet stern voice.  
“现在，你将成为我们唯一的行动单位，别忘了失败意味着什么。”他用低沉而严厉的声音提醒她。

Like she needed reminding.  
好像她需要提醒似的。

Turning, the man took a few steps before stopping, "Your new plugsuit is in a case just beside the door, they told me it was tailored perfectly."  
男人转身走了几步后停下，“你的新插件服就在门旁的箱子里，他们告诉我这是量身定做的。”

He started to move again, this time it was her turn to talk.  
他再次开始移动，这次轮到她开口了。

"Where are you going?" “你要去哪儿？”

He stopped again but didn't turn this time.  
他再次停下，但这次没有转身。

"I'm going to get another pilot."  
"我要再找一个驾驶员。"

ʡʘʘʢ

The commander of operations braced herself the best she could as the funicular shook once more from what had to be the Angel assaulting Tokyo-03 up above. To feel it down here though…  
作战指挥官尽可能地稳住自己，因为缆车再次因为天使攻击东京-03 而摇晃起来。尽管在这里也能感受到……

With one arm still in a cloth sling, she pushed her back into the wall of the car as the other hand was currently holding a phone.  
她的一只手臂还挂在布带上，背靠着车厢的墙壁，另一只手正拿着电话。

Misato gritted her teeth, as countless rounds of massive ammunition passed her on their way to the surface.  
美里咬紧牙关，眼看着无数重型弹药从她身边呼啸而过，直奔地面。

"Status Red. We need every weapon at our disposal firing at this target, hold it back." She barked, not that such a command was needed, with the authorization of N2 mines they currently were throwing everything they had against it.  
“红色警戒。我们需要动用所有武器集中火力攻击这个目标，阻止它前进。”她厉声命令道，实际上这样的指令并不必要，因为他们已经获得了 N2 地雷的使用授权，此刻正倾尽全力对付它。

Suddenly a flash of red caught her eye, twisting, she watched as the unmistakable figure of Unit-02 rushed up to the surface.  
突然，一抹红色映入眼帘，她扭头望去，只见二号机那 unmistakable 的身影疾速冲向地面。

"They're launching Unit-02? Who's piloting it?"  
"他们要启动零二号机？谁在驾驶它？"

"Unknown." Came a staticky response "Operations did not order its launch!"  
“未知。”传来一阵静电干扰的声音，“行动部门并未下达发射指令！”

Misato couldn't keep herself from staring at the giant humanoid rushing to the surface, confusion swirled in her mind, before ultimately, she had to push it down. Right now, there were more important matters and she would figure it out later.  
美里无法控制自己不去盯着那个冲向地表的巨大人形生物，困惑在她脑海中盘旋，但最终，她不得不将其压下。现在，有更重要的事情需要处理，她打算稍后再弄清楚。

Running as fast as she could towards the command center, Misato tried to ignore the pain from her previous injuries. She was sure there were more than a few stitches that would be torn after this, but right now a few bleeding wounds were the least of her worries.  
美里尽可能快地跑向指挥中心，试图忽略之前受伤带来的疼痛。她确信这次跑动后会有几处缝线被撕裂，但眼下，几处流血的伤口是她最不担心的。

Bursting into the command center, she spotted Ritsuko standing there, with all three computer technicians sitting at their respective seats.  
她猛地冲进指挥中心，一眼就看到了站在那里的律子，三位电脑技术员各自坐在他们的座位上。

"Divert Unit-02 to the GeoFront, it wouldn't make it to the surface in time!" she barked as Makoto turned to her. Pushing up his glasses he nodded as the violet-haired woman turned to Maya.  
"将二号机调往 GeoFront，它来不及赶到地面了！"她厉声说道，真嗣转向她。他推了推眼镜，点头示意，紫发的女子随即转向美里。

"What's the status of Unit-00?"  
"零号机的状况如何？"

"The left arm is undergoing emergency treatment," the girl explained "It should be ready soon."  
"左臂正在进行紧急处理，"女孩解释道，"应该很快就能准备好了。"

"I want it deployed as soon as it's ready." She ordered.  
"我希望它一准备好就立即部署。" 她命令道。

"The dummy system is being activated for Unit-01." Ritsuko explained.  
"为零一单元激活模拟系统。" 律子解释道。

Misato froze. She hadn't even let herself think of it on her way here, nor had she thought of its pilot.  
美里愣住了。她在来这里的路上甚至没有让自己去想这件事，也没有想到它的驾驶员。

"What about the pilot?" she asked quietly.  
“那飞行员呢？”她轻声问道。

ʡʘʘʢ

The boy had kept Dr. Akagi's keycard, meaning he was perfectly capable of leaving the quarantined room by himself.  
那男孩保留了赤木博士的门卡，这意味着他完全有能力自己离开隔离室。

Heaving back up to the observation deck, there were only two personnel there, both eyeing him warily but neither left their station even as another shockwave rippled through the underground facility.  
他再次爬上观察台，那里只有两名工作人员，两人都警惕地看着他，但即便地下设施再次传来冲击波，他们也没有离开自己的岗位。

Shinji figured they must have been ordered to stay, as it was rare for NERV personal to be here during an Angel attack, perhaps the care of one of the pilots was simply too important to leave up to computers and automation alone.  
真嗣推测他们一定是被命令留下，因为 NERV 人员在使徒攻击时通常不会在这里，或许对某位驾驶员的照顾太过重要，不能仅仅依赖电脑和自动化。

Walking over to the glass he peered down at her, raising his hand to the window, he witnessed one more artificial breath from the ventilator before turning to the two others in the room.  
他走到玻璃前，俯视着她，举起手贴在窗户上，目睹了呼吸机再次制造的一次人工呼吸，然后转向房间里的另外两人。

"Take care of her, please." It was all but him begging them. Much to his surprise one of them nodded to the pilot, who gave a sad smile in response.  
“请照顾好她。”这几乎是在恳求他们。令他惊讶的是，其中一人向驾驶员点了点头，后者则回以一个悲伤的微笑。

Taking his hand off the glass he made his way to the door and let his feet carry him to the EVA cages.  
他松开握着玻璃的手，走向门口，任由双脚带他前往 EVA 驾驶舱。

As explosion after explosion rocked the base, he refused to steady himself against anything. He had done this before, too many times, and even as the occasional NERV personal passing him stumbled, he continued without hesitation.  
随着一次又一次的爆炸震撼着基地，他拒绝扶住任何东西来稳住自己。他以前也经历过这种情况，太多次了，即使偶尔有 NERV 的工作人员从他身边经过时踉跄，他依然毫不犹豫地继续前行。

Until another set of footsteps alerted him to company.  
直到另一串脚步声提醒他有人接近。

"Shinji!" He heard Kaji call out behind him.  
"真嗣！" 他听到身后加持的呼喊。

He didn't stop, but he slowed down to let the man catch up. He of all people had the right to talk to him right now.  
他没有停下，但放慢了脚步让男人追上来。现在，他是最有资格和他说话的人。

What the boy hadn't expected was him grabbing his shoulder. Kaji spun him around, earning a look of annoyance from the body.  
男孩没料到的是，加持抓住了他的肩膀。加持将他转过身来，换来的是一脸的不悦。

"Keep walking if you want to talk." Shinji said bluntly as he turned and continued moving through the hallway.  
"想说话就继续走。" 真嗣直截了当地说，转身继续沿着走廊前行。

"Are you going to Unit-01?" the man asked, while also catching his breath. Shinji was willing to bet he had sprinted to find him. He noted how far removed the man was from the calm and collected one he knew so well.  
"你是要去初号机那里吗？" 那人边问边喘着气。真嗣敢打赌，他一定是跑着来找他的。他注意到这个人与他所熟知的那个冷静沉着的人相去甚远。

"Yes." The boy replied simply, "The commander will be there too."  
"是的。" 少年简单地回答，"司令也会在那里。"

"This isn't like the 3rd Angel Shinji. We need you…" but he was cut off.  
“这不像第三使徒真嗣。我们需要你……”但他话未说完就被打断了。

"I know exactly what it is Kaji, you don't need to tell me about it."  
"我知道那是什么，加治，你不必告诉我。"

The man finally grabbed him and pushed the boy against the wall, not earning so much as a surprised gasp. "What the hell does that mean?! Who the hell are you?!"  
男人终于抓住了他，将男孩推到墙上，却没有引起一丝惊讶的喘息。“那他妈是什么意思？！你他妈是谁？！”

Shinji said nothing and just looked at the arm currently holding him against the wall. "If you want me to keep the Angel from reaching Lilith, then you need to let me go."  
真嗣什么也没说，只是看着目前将他按在墙上的手臂。“如果你想让我阻止使徒接近莉莉丝，那你需要放开我。”

Kaji seemed to search his face for some sense of dishonesty, but Shinji didn't have time for this, Zeruel didn't have Asuka to slow it down, Unit-00 was still under repair and it wouldn't last long even if they set it against the Angel.  
加持似乎在审视他的面容，寻找一丝不诚实的迹象，但真嗣无暇顾及这些，零号机仍在维修中，即便投入对抗使徒也撑不了多久，而使徒泽鲁尔没有了明日香来拖慢它的步伐。

Somehow the situation seemed even more hopeless than his first time fighting the creature. Yet this time he knew he would fight, and he knew he could win.  
不知为何，这次的情况似乎比他第一次与那怪物交手时更加无望。然而这一次，他知道自己会战斗，也知道自己能够取胜。

Slowly the pressure lifted from his chest and he turned to keep walking.  
渐渐地，胸口的压迫感减轻了，他转身继续前行。

"I need answers Shinji. What the hell happened with Unit-03?"  
“我需要答案，真嗣。三号机到底发生了什么鬼事？”

Shinji stopped on his own this time, but he didn't turn to face the man. "I made a mistake." He said quietly as the hallway was rocked by another shockwave, sprinkling both of them with bits of dust from the ceiling.  
这次是真嗣自己停下了脚步，但他没有转过身来面对那人。“我犯了个错误。”他轻声说道，与此同时，走廊再次被冲击波撼动，天花板上掉落的灰尘洒在了他们两人身上。

"Asuka shouldn't have been the pilot, she wouldn't have been able to pilot it… I should have…" he stopped, his words catching in his throat.  
"明日香本不该是驾驶员，她无法驾驶它的…我本该…" 他停了下来，话语哽在喉咙里。

"You knew there was something wrong with Unit-03?"  
"你知道 03 号机有问题？"

Shinji didn't respond, he just started walking again. He didn't want to have this conversation, at least not right now, he needed to get to Unit-01.  
真嗣没有回应，只是又开始走动。他不想进行这场对话，至少不是现在，他需要赶到 01 号机那里。

"Shinji!" Kaji called after him as he once again trailed the boy.  
"真嗣！" 真嗣再次跟随男孩时，加持在他身后喊道。

"This is over your head Kaji, let it be."  
"这件事你不必插手，加持，让它过去吧。"

"You're not with me, but you know about what I do. Should I expect your father to know as well?"  
"你虽未参与，但了解我的所作所为。我是否也该预料到你父亲会知道呢？"

"How about you go find Misato, be with her after this. She'll need you."  
“你去找美里吧，之后陪在她身边。她会需要你的。”

Kaji said nothing, but he kept pace with the boy, much to the Third Children's annoyance. For once he didn't want to be around the man, he wanted to be alone right now.  
加持没有说话，但他一直与少年并肩而行，这让第三适格者颇为恼火。此刻，他只想独处，不想身边有这个人。

After a while, the footsteps stopped, but he pushed on, not caring that the man had stopped following him.  
过了一会儿，脚步声停了，但他继续前行，并不在意那人是否还在跟随。

"Shinji…" “真嗣……”

At that tone, he did stop, however. It was a tone of voice he rarely heard from the man. Shinji was sure that Kaji held plenty of distrust towards him, especially after the last talk they had, but despite this Shinji knew what that voice meant. It was completely genuine  
听到这个语气，他确实停了下来。这是他很少从那个人口中听到的语气。真嗣确信，尤其是上次谈话之后，加持对他充满了不信任，但尽管如此，真嗣知道那个声音意味着什么。它是完全真诚的。

"Asuka… Asuka isn't that girl you failed. You understand that, don't you?"  
“明日香……明日香不是你失败的那个女孩。你明白这一点，对吧？”

At that moment it took all his strength to keep from shouting back at him. He wanted to rage at Kaji, tell him that he had failed her too many times to count. He wanted to explain who he was and what he did so bad it was making him shake.  
那一刻，他竭尽全力才没有冲着加持大喊回去。他想对加持发火，告诉他他也失败了她太多次数不清。他想要解释自己是谁，做了什么，这种渴望强烈到让他颤抖。

But he forced those feeling down again… perhaps after this battle… he would explain things, but still… he could at least tell him something now.  
但他再次压抑了这些情感……或许在这场战斗之后……他会解释一切，但即便如此……他现在至少可以告诉他一些事情。

"You're wrong." “你错了。”

ʡʘʘʢ

At least Kaji had been right that her new suit was tailored. It didn't help against the freezing conditions of long-term storage, but that chill was soon replaced by the warmth of LCL flooding the entry plug.  
至少加持说对了，她的新驾驶服是量身定做的。虽然它无法抵御长期储存中的严寒，但很快，插入栓内涌入的 LCL 带来的温暖取代了那份寒意。

Standing there in the GeoFront, Mari watched as the retractable skyscrapers showered down from Tokyo-03, each crashing down like spears from the heavens.  
站在地底空间中，玛丽目睹着东京-03 的可伸缩摩天大楼如雨般倾泻而下，每一座都宛如天降之矛般轰然坠落。

For the first time, she could experience the true feeling of being in a proper Evangelion. Not a simulator, not a half-working provisional unit, this was a production model that she could tell had none of the coarseness she experienced previously.  
这是她第一次真正体验到驾驶一台正规的 EVA 的感觉。不是模拟器，也不是半成品的临时单元，这是一台她能感觉到没有任何先前体验过的粗糙的生产型号。

She took a deep inhale of LCL, relishing the smell, even if it was accented with the scent of the Second Child, it was still pleasing.  
她深深吸入 LCL，享受着那气味，即便其中混杂着二号机驾驶员的气息，依然令人愉悦。

As the debris and buildings continued to rain down in the center of the GeoFront, the girl picked up two Type MM-99 Assault Rifles from one of several containers surrounding her EVA.  
当碎片和建筑继续在 GeoFront 中心区域倾泻而下时，女孩从围绕着她的 EVA 的几个集装箱中拿起两把 Type MM-99 突击步枪。

Taking aim, she took a deep breath, there was no reason to start shooting if she couldn't see anything yet. Her fingers twitched, itching to finally feel real recoil from the weapons.  
她瞄准目标，深吸一口气，如果还看不见任何东西，就没有开枪的必要。她的手指微微抽动，渴望着终于能感受到武器真实的后坐力。

Finally, black tendrils seemed to grow from the dome while more buildings fell as it squeezed its way through the hole it had made through the armored layers.  
终于，黑色的触须似乎从圆顶中生长出来，更多的建筑在它穿过装甲层所制造的洞口时崩塌。

Mari's index fingers flexed, unleashing a stream of 209mm shells towards her opponent. The 10th Angel hardly seemed fazed by the constant explosions enveloping it, instead, it simply floated down towards the growing pile of buildings at the bottom of the GeoFront.  
玛丽的食指弯曲，释放出一连串 209 毫米的炮弹射向对手。第十使徒几乎未被持续的爆炸所影响，反而只是缓缓地向着地底都市底部不断堆积的建筑残骸飘去。

The girl refused to let up on the triggers, even as the Angel projected its AT field towards her. The stream of shells and AT Field began to push against one another, pushing back and forth between the two foes.  
女孩拒绝松开扳机，即便使徒向她展开了 AT 力场。弹幕与 AT 力场开始相互抗衡，两者之间来回推挤，形成僵持之势。

Finally, her rifles expended all their ammo and Mari simply threw them aside. The AT field wouldn't be penetrated from this range, it was simply too strong.  
最终，她的步枪耗尽了所有弹药，玛丽索性将它们扔到一旁。AT 力场在这个距离上无法被穿透，它实在太强了。

But maybe… 但或许……

The girl pushed her glasses up with a smirk and turned to another crate. As it opened, she stomped down on the deploy button and up shot her weapon of choice.  
女孩带着一丝得意的笑容推了推眼镜，转向另一个箱子。随着她踩下部署按钮，她选择的武器应声升起。

She recalled the designation, GB-012. Of course, it had a considerably longer and more complex name that she could barely recall, but it also had been given a nickname from the engineers that had designed and built it.  
她回想起那个代号，GB-012。当然，它有一个更长更复杂的全名，她几乎记不清了，但设计并建造它的工程师们还给它起了个昵称。

"Thunder Spear," she smiled as its blade extended, "lets see what this bad boy can do!"  
“雷枪，”她微笑着，看着它的刀刃伸展开来，“让我们看看这坏小子能做什么！”

Charging at the Angel, Mari smiled as her heart pounded in her chest, this would seal its fate, she was sure of it.  
玛丽向使徒冲去，心中激动不已，她相信这一击将决定它的命运。

Launching into the air, she held the weapon above her head, thrusting it downwards as she landed on the 10th Angel.  
她腾空而起，将武器高举过头，随着落在第 10 使徒身上，猛地向下刺去。

Its AT field flashed violently at the power being projected from the tip of the weapon, even driving it down into the earth.  
它的 AT 力场在武器尖端释放的强大力量下剧烈闪烁，甚至将其压入地面。

Mari gritted her teeth, she expected it to have gone through, but perhaps all she needed was a bit more force.  
真希波咬紧牙关，她本以为会一击贯穿，但或许再多些力量便足够了。

Deploying the left shoulder pylon launcher, she watched as 6 rods shot out at point-blank range, but it was in vain.  
她启动左肩挂载的发射器，眼看着六根长矛在极近距离射出，却徒劳无功。

The Angel's eyes glowed and she was hurled backwards, skipping along the GeoFront while crashing through building after building, finally coming to a stop against a particularly thick skyscraper.  
使徒的双眼闪烁着光芒，她被猛地向后抛去，沿着地表跳跃，接连撞穿一栋又一栋建筑，最终在一座特别厚实的高楼前停了下来。

Shaking her head, she noticed the attack just in time as she pushed herself upright and jumped out of the way while an AT field came down where she had just been a minute ago. If she had just sat there, Mari was sure she'd be flattened  
她摇了摇头，及时注意到攻击，随即挺身而起，跳向一旁，就在她刚刚所在的位置，AT 力场轰然落下。如果她刚才还坐在那里，玛丽确信自己会被压扁。

Landing, the 10th Angel just stared at the EVA, seemingly daring it to make the first move.  
着陆的第 10 使徒只是盯着 EVA，仿佛在挑衅它先动手。

Pushing herself out of her seat, Mari adjusted her glasses. The Angel's black tendrils had stretched out before it while it just hovered there.  
玛丽从座位上站起身，调整了一下眼镜。使徒的黑色触须在它前方伸展，而它只是悬浮在那里。

She hadn't expected it to be so strong, but now it was looking like there might only be one way of beating it.  
她没料到它会如此强大，但现在看来，似乎只有一种方法能击败它。

That specific plan wasn't something she was exactly looking forwards to, but right now… there was no backup, there was only her and this gamble was the only way.  
那个特定的计划并非她所期待，但此刻…没有备选方案，只有她和这场赌注是唯一的出路。

"Alright, lets show you the power of an EVA that's abandoned its humanity."  
“好吧，让你见识一下抛弃人性后的 EVA 之力。”

That line was more about getting herself ready than it was meant for the Angel itself.  
那句话更多的是为了让自己做好准备，而非针对天使本身。

This was going to hurt… a lot.  
这会很疼……非常疼。

"Invert controls, backdoor code: 'The Beast'."  
反转控制，后门代码：'野兽'。

Instantly the entry plug's screen went dark, filled only with red outlines warning of danger. The girl closed her eyes and tried to steady her breath, but the hammering of her heart made that all but impossible.  
驾驶舱的屏幕立刻变暗，只剩下红色轮廓警告危险。女孩闭上眼睛，试图稳住呼吸，但心脏的剧烈跳动几乎让她无法做到。

She could feel it creeping up on her, only for the pain to wash over her as the Evangelion convulsed.  
她能感觉到它悄然而至，紧接着痛苦如潮水般席卷而来，使初号机剧烈抽搐。

"Bear with it Unit-02, this isn't easy for me either."  
“忍耐一下，二号机，这对我来说也不容易。”

She could feel the restrictor rods being pushed out of the EVA's body as if it were her own skin being pierced, but she refused to let out any audible protest.  
她能感受到限制器杆被从 EVA 体内推出，仿佛自己的皮肤被刺穿，但她坚决不发出任何可闻的抗议。

Mari was sure those in the command center would be watching their screen in horror or confusion as the EVA's body morphed. Twisting and contorting into something more… dangerous.  
玛丽确信，指挥中心的人看到 EVA 的身体变形时，要么惊恐万分，要么困惑不解。它扭曲变形，变成了某种更...危险的东西。

"Nothing… ventured… nothing… gained." She choked out as the pain was forcing her to her knees.  
“不入虎穴...焉得虎子。”她哽咽着说，剧痛迫使她跪倒在地。

"C'mon Unit-02, just a little more!" she shouted as the feeling of armor popping off tore at her nerves.  
“来吧，二号机，再努力一点！”她喊道，装甲剥离的感觉撕扯着她的神经。

Finally, the power cable ejected from the Unit as she could hear the roar of the Evangelion ring across the GeoFront.  
终于，电源线从机体中弹出，她能听到福音战士的咆哮在 GeoFront 回荡。

"THERE IT IS!" “就在那儿！”

To her right, the five-minute timer started to count down on a malfunctioning screen, but she had already launched forwards. Both the girl and the EVA were ready to tear the Angel apart.  
在她右侧，五分钟倒计时在一个故障的屏幕上开始，但她已经向前冲去。少女和 EVA 都准备好将使徒撕成碎片。

The ground was torn away at the speed of Unit-02. Trees were ripped from the ground at every footstep and when she had finally come into range of the Angel, she once again launched herself through the air.  
二号机的速度将地面撕裂。每一步都让树木从地面被拔起，当她终于进入使徒的攻击范围时，她再次腾空而起。

Its AT field shattered upon the impact, or at least half of it did.  
它的 AT 力场在撞击下破碎，至少有一半如此。

Unit-02 found itself blocked by a second layer, seeming even more impenetrable as the first had been, still blocking her from the Angel itself.  
初号机发现自己被第二层屏障所阻，这层屏障似乎比第一层更为坚不可摧，依旧阻挡在她与使徒之间。

Climbing onto the Field itself, she reared back and brought down the EVAs hands, smashing through layer after layer.  
她攀上力场本身，后仰身体，挥下 EVA 的双手，一层层地击穿。

"CMON!" she shouted, how many layers could there be!?  
"“快点！”她喊道，“到底还有多少层！？”

In her drive to smash her way through, she barely noticed the Angel pulling back two of its tendrils. Mari could do nothing as they shot out at Unit-02.  
在她奋力突破的过程中，她几乎没有注意到使徒收回了其中两条触手。真嗣无能为力，只能眼睁睁看着它们向二号机射去。

She screaming in agony as the feeling of her arm being ripped away washed over her. Thrown back, simply pushing herself up was all she could manage.  
她痛苦地尖叫着，手臂被撕裂的感觉席卷而来。被击退后，她只能勉强撑起自己。

She barely felt the next impact.  
她几乎感觉不到下一次的冲击。

ʡʘʘʢ

Rei Ayanami was expendable.  
绫波零是可以被牺牲的。

She had known that since the day she was created.  
自从她被创造出来的那天起，她就明白了这一点。

The girl was able to be replaced, it had always seemed to give her a different view of the world compared to others. At least that was how she felt, considering she didn't have much interaction with others.  
这个女孩能够被替代，这似乎让她对世界有了与其他人不同的看法。至少她是这么感觉的，毕竟她与其他人的互动并不多。

At least until him. 至少在他之前。

Shinji Ikari, who had changed so much since forcing his way into her entry plug, who had been nice to her, who had brought her food, who had displayed just how alive someone could be.  
碇真嗣，自从强行进入她的插入栓后变化巨大，对她友善，给她带食物，展现出一个人可以多么鲜活。

On her hip rested the SDAT player he had carried; she hadn't placed it back before leaving her apartment. Rei wasn't exactly sure why, but it made her feel warm for some reason, so she kept it.  
她腰间挂着他曾携带的 SDAT 播放器；离开公寓前，她并未将其放回原处。丽并不完全明白为何如此，但这莫名让她感到温暖，于是她便一直带着它。

Unit-00 rose into the GeoFront, she cared one last N2 missile, one that would be the last hope for the world.  
零号机升入地底都市，她携带了最后一枚 N2 导弹，这将是世界的最后希望。

The shouting of Misato telling her to stop rang her ear, but she ignored her, this was her purpose, this was what she was made to do.  
美里让她停下的呼喊声在耳边回响，但她置若罔闻，这是她的使命，这是她被创造出来的意义。

But there was more. 但还有更多。

The 10th Angel turned in time to stop her from hitting it, the missile's nose impacting its AT field as the rocket motors fired.  
第十使徒及时转身，阻止了她撞击过来，导弹的头部撞击在其 AT 力场上，火箭发动机随即点火。

"AT Field, full power." “AT 力场，全功率。”

The entire force of her EVA, the missile, and her AT field pushed against the Angels, but it felt useless.  
她的 EVA、导弹以及 AT 力场的全部力量都压向使徒，但感觉毫无作用。

"I can do this… for him." She gritted her teeth, willing the Evangelion forwards "So he never has to pilot again."  
"我可以做到的……为了他。" 她咬紧牙关，驱动着福音战士前进，"这样他就再也不必驾驶了。"

She struggled against the power of the 10th Angel, it pushed back against her, even as she believed the missile had pushed through the field, she found herself being forced backwards. There was nothing left for her to give.  
她与第 10 使徒的力量抗争着，对方推挤着她，尽管她相信导弹已经穿透了力场，却发现自己在被迫后退。她已经倾尽所有。

There was simply no way she could do this by herself.  
她根本无法独自完成这件事。

Suddenly, to her left, she saw the red outline of Unit-02, or what Unit-02 had become. Its humanoid figure had been abandoned in favor of something much more animalistic. Yet, despite missing an arm and gushing red fluids from its body, the inhuman teeth of the EVA ripped away at the AT field's layers one by one.  
突然间，在她左侧，她看到了二号机的红色轮廓，或者说二号机已经变成的样子。它放弃了人形，转而呈现出更加兽性的形态。尽管失去了一只手臂，身体不断涌出红色液体，但这非人的 EVA 用其锋利的牙齿一层层撕裂着 AT 力场。

Finally, as it tore away one more layer, Rei felt the resistance to her missile falter. It slammed against the body of the Angel, while she turned to Unit-02 and its mysterious pilot.  
最终，当它再次撕开一层力场时，绫波感受到了导弹所受的阻力减弱。导弹猛烈撞击在使徒的躯体上，而她则转向二号机及其神秘的驾驶员。

Grabbing them and tossing them back, Unit-00 turned to whoever was inside.  
零号机抓住它们并将其抛回，随即转向内部不知名的人。

"Now run, get out of here," she pleaded "and thank you."  
"快跑，离开这里，" 她恳求道，"谢谢你。"

The enormous power of the N2 warhead was unleashed and Rei's vision went dark.  
N2 鱼雷的巨大威力被释放，绫波的视野陷入黑暗。

ʡʘʘʢ

The sound of Unit-01's protests echoed off the walls as Shinji entered the cages.  
初号机抗议的声响在墙壁间回荡，真嗣走进了拘禁室。

The commander was there, leaning over a terminal shouting commands to technicians as they tried to keep the Evangelion from rejecting the dummy plug.  
指挥官就在那里，俯身于终端前，向技术人员们大声下达指令，他们正努力防止使徒拒绝模拟插入栓。

"Why? Why are you refusing me, Yui?" he heard the man mumble as he walked up to him.  
“为什么？为什么你要拒绝我，唯？”他走近那人时，听到他喃喃自语。

"It won't make a difference."  
"这不会有任何改变。"

Turning, the bearded face of Gendo Ikari met with the younger pilot's. Shinji clenched his fist, making sure he wasn't about to do anything that would keep the man from letting him back in that entry plug.  
转身，须发皆张的碇源堂的面孔与年轻驾驶员的目光相遇。真嗣紧握拳头，确保自己不会做出任何让这个男人阻止他再次进入插入栓的事情。

"What are you doing here?" that familiar voice asked, the same one that lacked all sense of caring for him.  
"你在这里做什么？"那个熟悉的声音问道，依旧是那个对他漠不关心的声音。

"You know what I said and by the looks of things you're going to need me in Unit-01." Shinji just looked out to the Evangelion, "Are you going to let this Angel just waltz into Terminal Dogma, or are you going to do what I asked?"  
"你知道我说过什么，看样子你需要我在 01 单位里。" 真嗣只是望向那台福音战士，"你是打算让这个天使就这样大摇大摆进入最终教条区，还是按我说的去做？"

By then the whole room had gone quiet, the technicians stopping their work to stare at the two of them as more shockwaves shook loose debris down around them and lights flickered.  
那时整个房间都安静了下来，技术人员们停下手中的工作，盯着他们俩，更多的冲击波震落了周围的碎片，灯光闪烁不定。

Neither commander nor pilot backed down from each other. Both stood there, seemingly fighting a battle of wills that no one could see.  
指挥官和驾驶员谁也没有退让。两人站在那里，仿佛在进行一场无人能见的意志较量。

In the end, however, there can only be one victor.  
然而，最终只能有一个胜者。

.

.

.

"I…" the words seemed to catch in the man's throat, but Shinji had time, "...am sorry, Shinji."  
"我…" 那人的话似乎卡在了喉咙里，但真嗣有时间，"...对不起，真嗣。"

Gendo's voice seemed to reverberate through the room, it was plainly obvious to all those there that the words spoken had been choked out. The boy hadn't lied, somehow those words were hardest for him to say.  
源堂的声音似乎在房间里回荡，在场的人都明显感觉到这些话是被硬挤出来的。那男孩没有撒谎，不知为何这些话对他来说最难说出口。

The boy said nothing, frowning at those words as he pushed past the man and heading towards his Evangelion.  
男孩一言不发，对着那些话皱起眉头，推开男人径直走向他的 EVA。

"If I didn't know better, I actually think I'd believe you."  
“如果我不了解得更清楚些，我几乎都要相信你了。”

ʡʘʘʢ

Mari could just barely make out Unit-01 raising from the ground. The haze left from the N2 blast had obscured her vision only till recently, now she could see the 10th Angel clearly.  
玛丽勉强能看见初号机从地面升起。N2 爆炸产生的烟雾刚刚才散去，现在她能清楚地看到第十使徒。

Mari felt herself being pulled from the plane of consciousness, the pain was doing that. She was sure the Evangelion's life support systems were doing their best, despite the damage the EVA as a whole had sustained.  
玛丽感到自己正被从意识层面拉扯出来，疼痛正是罪魁祸首。她确信，尽管整个 EVA 遭受了损伤，生命维持系统仍在尽力运作。

Over her comms, a window of the boy she had met on that rooftop appeared, somehow bypassing the two-way link she had cut.  
通讯器上，一个窗口突然出现，显示着她在屋顶上遇到的那个男孩，不知怎么绕过了她切断的双向链接。

His face, just like when he threatened her, gave the girl a chill down her spine. Those eyes were cold, focused, and had the most unforgiving look to them.  
他的脸，就像他威胁她时那样，让女孩感到脊背发凉。那双眼睛冰冷、专注，带着最不容情的神色。

"You need to get out of here." He said calmly yet firmly, somehow his voice was steady despite the scene of destruction around them.  
“你需要离开这里。”他平静而坚定地说，尽管周围是一片废墟，他的声音却出奇地稳定。

"I can still help," she said weakly, doing her best to push the Evangelion back and upright.  
“我还能帮忙，”她虚弱地说，尽力推动着那台福音战士重新站稳。

Shinji just shook his head "Your EVA is too damaged; you'll just get in the way. Eject or get it down to the cages."  
真嗣只是摇了摇头，“你的 EVA 损坏太严重了；你会碍事的。弹射出去或者把它降到笼子里去。”

"You need to know what you're going up against." She mumbled, doing her best to stay awake. The boy didn't know how powerful that thing was, how it had tossed her around like some play toy. It was a suicide mission for a single EVA.  
“你需要知道你面对的是什么。”她喃喃自语，尽力保持清醒。那男孩不知道那东西有多强大，它把她像玩具一样随意抛掷。对一架 EVA 来说，这简直是自杀任务。

"I already know." He said simply "We're old friends."  
“我已经知道了。”他简单地说，“我们是老朋友了。”

The screen went blank and Mari barely remembered pushing the eject button. Her vision turned dark as she drifted off into the void.  
屏幕一闪而逝，玛丽几乎记不清自己是否按下了弹出键。她的视线渐渐暗淡，随即沉入了虚无之中。

What did he mean by that?  
他那话是什么意思？

ʡʘʘʢ

"So… it's you." “所以……是你。”

Shinji watched the 'face' of Zeruel crack open. Eyes widening, he watched as a massive petal-shaped mouth rushed forwards and came down around a charred Unit-00.  
真嗣注视着 Zeruel 的‘面孔’裂开。他瞪大了眼睛，看着一个巨大的花瓣状嘴巴向前冲来，将烧焦的零号机吞没。

Returning to its host, the Angel's body began to morph, the lower half flexing and changing color until it transformed into a humanoid form.  
天使的躯体开始变形，下半身弯曲并改变颜色，直到它转变为一个人形。

"It absorbed Unit-00." He breathed.  
“它吞噬了零号机。”他喘息道。

"_What does that mean?" An equally perplexed redhead asked behind him._  
"那是什么意思？" 他身后同样困惑的红发女孩问道。

She was here, much to his annoyance, but perhaps the extra set of eyes would be useful, especially now. This was unlike anything before and he was sure this fight would be very different.  
她在这里，尽管让他感到烦恼，但或许多一双眼睛会有用，尤其是在现在。这种情况前所未见，他确信这场战斗将会非常不同。

The 10th Angel straightened itself into the air, the lower human half almost being draped in the black tendrils the Angel had from its first form.  
第 10 使徒在空中挺直了身躯，其下半部的人形几乎被使徒第一形态的黑色触须所覆盖。

"Nothing good I guess." He said as his hands gripped the controls tighter.  
“估计没什么好事。”他紧握操纵杆，双手更加用力。

It seemed it was another piece of his destiny to face this creature. The two of them were well acquainted, even if he was the only one that knew it.  
似乎命中注定他要面对这个生物。他们彼此相当熟悉，尽管只有他一人知晓这份渊源。

The question now became, how was he going to save Rei? He had a feeling this fight wouldn't be as easy as it normally was and he needed to keep a level head if he was going to beat this thing.  
现在的问题是，他该如何拯救丽？他有种预感，这场战斗不会像平时那样轻松，如果他想打败这东西，就必须保持冷静的头脑。

"_You know, after everything, I always wanted to see you fight when you were really pissed off." Soryu mused from behind him._  
"你知道吗，经历了那么多，我总想看看你真正生气时的战斗。" 索留在他身后若有所思地说道。

"You do remember that you lost this fight when you got carried away." He smirked.  
"你还记得吧，你在这场战斗中因为过于投入而输了。" 他得意地笑了笑。

"_Hey! At least I didn't run away first!" she countered._  
"嘿！至少我没有先逃跑！" 她反驳道。

He shrugged at the comment "You got me there.".  
他对那句话耸了耸肩，"你说到点子上了。"

"Let's end this." “让我们结束这一切吧。”

**Yeah so I'm late, trust me… alright I don't have a good excuse, I just kept putting off writing the fight scene tbh. So to be clear we'll have chapter 35 (which WILL be out before August 14****th****) and I'll talk about what happens after that at the end of the chapter.**  
是啊，我迟到了，相信我……好吧，我没有好的借口，老实说我一直在拖延写打斗场面。所以明确一下，我们会有chapter 35（绝对会在 8 月 14 日前出来），然后我会在chapter的结尾谈谈之后会发生什么。

**YodaMorpheus7 – Technically, Zeruel isn't the last Angel, because in 3.0 there's another one that comes out of Unit-06 I believe when they go down to Lilith at the end of the movie and then there's Kaworu, but as for Angels in the classic sense of attacking the city, yeah last one.  
YodaMorpheus7 – 严格来说，Zeruel 并不是最后一个使徒，因为在 3.0 中，我相信当他们前往电影结尾处的莉莉丝时，另一个使徒从 06 号机中出现，然后还有渚薰，但就传统意义上攻击城市的使徒而言，是的，最后一个。**

**Until Next Time. 下次再会。**


### Chapter 35: "…I'm Nuclear, I'm Wild…"  
Chapter 35: "…我是核能，我是狂野…"

A hand reached out to the blue orb in the black sky. Its owner clicked the buttons on his wrist, causing his plugsuit to seal firmly against his pale skin.  
一只手伸向黑色天空中那颗蓝色球体。它的主人按动手腕上的按钮，使得他的驾驶服紧紧贴合在他苍白的皮肤上。

"The Third again hmm?" He mumbled with a smile, no one would hear his voice, not in the vacuum of space, yet he stood there, with no protection against the adverse conditions.  
“又是第三次冲击吗？”他喃喃自语，嘴角带着微笑，在这太空的真空环境中，无人能听见他的声音，但他依然站在那里，没有任何防护措施来抵御恶劣的环境。

"You haven't changed a bit." He chuckled.  
“你一点都没变。”他轻声笑道。

Looking down at the dark blue Eva he was standing on, the pale boy sighed, beginning his climb down, eyeing the massive red spear next to his EVA. Perhaps that pilot could never change. The thought of the Third Child caused the edges of his lips to curl even more.  
低头看着脚下深蓝色的 EVA，苍白的少年叹了口气，开始向下攀爬，目光落在 EVA 旁边那巨大的红色长矛上。或许那位驾驶员永远都不会改变。想到第三适格者，他的嘴角不禁扬起了更多的弧度。

Kaworu Nagisa knew one thing, they would always meet again, it was only a matter of time.  
渚薰明白一件事，他们终会再次相遇，只是时间问题。

ʡʘʘʢ

Beneath hundreds of feet of dirt, stone, and armor plating, civilians huddled in darkened shelters, illuminated only by the faint glow of red emergency lighting.  
在数百英尺的泥土、石块和装甲板之下，平民们蜷缩在昏暗的避难所中，仅有的光源是微弱的红色应急灯光。

With each shockwave, bits of dust and debris from the domed ceilings, sprinkling down on the increasingly worried crowd and eliciting more than one sneeze.  
每一次冲击波袭来，穹顶上的尘埃和碎片便纷纷落下，洒在愈发焦虑的人群上，引发不止一声的喷嚏。

None could truly know how damaged their city was. Not even one pilot's closest friends, who had witnessed the Angel just before entering the shelters could comprehend the destruction that awaited them above ground.  
无人能真正知晓这座城市受损有多严重。即便是那位驾驶员最亲密的朋友，他们在进入避难所前目睹了使徒，也无法理解地面上等待他们的毁灭。

Toji's younger sister had asked to see the boy who had fought the Fourth Angel and while her older brother had initially protested, Kensuke had also wanted to go to his apartment due to the uncharacteristically long absence of all pilots.  
真嗣的妹妹想见见那个与第四使徒战斗的男孩，尽管她的哥哥起初反对，但健司也因为所有驾驶员异常长时间的缺席而想去他的公寓看看。

They had found the apartment door wide open, the NERV colonel seemingly gone in a hurry. One very confused penguin later and the sirens started to blare, alerting them to seek out the nearest shelters.  
他们发现公寓门大敞着，NERV 的司令官似乎匆忙离去。一只非常困惑的企鹅之后，警报开始响起，提醒他们寻找最近的避难所。

Pen Pen, to his credit, did quite well being whisked away, probably due to the treats the children had bribed him with and had surprisingly not been at all worried about the constant shaking of the shelter, while also being a great distraction for younger children. Keeping their minds occupied from the very real danger that surrounded them.  
值得称赞的是，Pen Pen 在被迅速带走时表现得相当不错，这可能得益于孩子们用零食贿赂他，而且他竟然对庇护所持续的晃动毫不担心，同时还能很好地分散年幼孩子的注意力，让他们不再被周围实实在在的危险所困扰。

For a little while, the shockwaves had stopped, and relief had settled over the masses packed tightly into the bunker complex. It had seemed that the Angel had finally been stopped, and the common belief was that soon they'd be allowed to return to their homes.  
有那么一会儿，冲击波停止了，紧挤在地下掩体中的人群感到了一丝宽慰。似乎天使终于被阻止了，大家普遍认为很快就能回家了。

The idea that there might not be a city to return to never crossed any of their minds.  
他们从未想过，可能已经没有城市可以回去了。

And as the walls around them began to shake again, unbeknownst to them, an ageless boy held their fates in his hands.  
而当周围的墙壁再次震动时，他们浑然不觉，一个永恒的少年正掌握着他们的命运。

ʡʘʘʢ

The problem with fighting the same opponent life after life is you know all their tricks, all their strategies, or at least you believe you do. It makes you blind to anything new.  
与同一个对手生生世世战斗的问题在于，你自以为熟知他们所有的伎俩和策略。这让你对任何新事物视而不见。

"_Idiot!" the invisible redhead shouted at him, alerting him to the AT field crashing down from overhead._  
“白痴！”看不见的红发人对他大喊，提醒他 AT 力场正从头顶崩塌下来。

Shinji jumped out of the way, as Zeruel produced another AT field right above where Unit-01 just landed.  
真嗣迅速跳开，因为零尔在初号机刚刚着陆的地方上方又生成了一个 AT 力场。

The boy's eyes widened at the ground he had just stood on, now compacted down through immeasurable force. Over and over again, he was forced to dodge a seemingly endless strain of attacks, each closer than the last, before finally…  
男孩的眼睛因刚刚站立的地面被无与伦比的力量压缩而瞪大。他一次又一次被迫躲避着似乎永无止境的攻击，每一次都比上一次更接近，直到最后……

Unit-01 was sent flying backward, an arm from the Angel hitting it square in the chest. The Third Children had been so busy focusing on the novel strikes from above he hadn't kept track of Zeruel's other strikes.  
初号机被猛地击飞出去，使徒的一只手臂正中其胸膛。第三适格者过于专注于来自上方的全新攻势，以至于未能留意到零号使徒的其他攻击。

Skipping once over the GeoFront's earth, Unit-01 came to land face-down, the pilot inside taking a moment to orient himself.  
初号机在 GeoFront 的地面上一跃而过，最终面朝下着陆，驾驶舱内的驾驶员需要片刻来调整自己的方位。

He couldn't save Asuka… he couldn't save Rei… why the hell did he think he could do this?  
他没能救下明日香……也没能救下绫波……他到底为什么会认为自己能做到这些？

"_Get up Third!" she barked at him "You killed this thing with almost no training, so finish it!"_  
“起来，老三！”她厉声喝道，“你几乎没怎么训练就干掉了这玩意儿，那就把它彻底解决！”

She was right about that… she was right about a lot of things.  
她在这点上是正确的……她在很多事情上都是正确的。

Pushing Unit-01 up, Shinji spotted Zeruel through the still hazy GeoFront. Walking away from him, its stride seemingly carefree with the lack of resistance. The 'eyes' seemed to pulse with light as the pyramid that had been nearly unaffected by the N2 blast only minutes earlier, was decimated by the Angel's attack.  
推着零号机上升，真嗣透过仍朦胧的 GeoFront 看到了 Zeruel。它似乎毫无阻力地悠闲迈步离开他。那些‘眼睛’似乎随着光芒跳动，几分钟前几乎未受 N2 炸弹爆炸影响的金字塔，在使徒的攻击下被彻底摧毁。

What was the point of fighting this thing anyways? He had lost Asuka in a coma, he'd be treated like a criminal when he got back, and Rei was gone, what was the point?  
无论如何，与这东西战斗的意义何在？他失去了陷入昏迷的明日香，回去后会被当作罪犯对待，而丽也消失了，这一切还有什么意义？

"_Do it because I want you to!" he was sure she was trying in vain to hit him "Now get your ass up and move!"_  
"做吧，因为我想要你这么做！" 他确信她在徒劳地试图击中他，"现在站起来，动起来！"

"_Do you think that thing isn't going to hurt_ her_," she asked, referring to the comatose girl in the medical wing "what do you think happens to her if you don't stop Zeruel?"_  
"你以为那东西不会伤害她吗？" 她问道，指的是医疗翼中昏迷的女孩，"如果你不阻止零尔，你认为她会怎么样？"

She wanted him to fight, he was sure Shikinami would want him to fight…. fine.  
她希望他战斗，他确信式波会希望他战斗……好吧。

Shinji willed the Evangelion forwards, dashing across the GeoFront with grace and speed that he hadn't even shown in the fight against this world's Sahaquiel. Zeruel had turned just in time, its AT Field shooting back up to protect itself, only it wouldn't be enough this time.  
真嗣操控着 EVA 向前冲刺，以一种他在对抗这个世界的萨哈基尔时都未曾展现过的优雅与速度横跨 GeoFront。零尔及时转身，其 AT 力场迅速重新展开以自保，但这次却远远不够。

Unit-01 smashed into it, shattering layer after layer. Shinju pushed his own AT field forwards, using it to tear away, while his EVA's arms forced their way through. It was enough for him to actually grab the Angel's face, but it was all in vain.  
初号机猛烈撞击上去，一层层击碎其防御。真嗣推动自己的 AT 力场向前，用它撕裂阻碍，同时 EVA 的双臂强行突破。这足以让他真正抓住使徒的面孔，但一切都是徒劳。

A searing pain coursed through his arm as he watched Unit-01's forearm sliced through the center. The cut starting between Unit-01s fingers and ending at its elbow.  
当他看到初号机的前臂从中被切断时，一阵剧痛贯穿了他的手臂。切口始于初号机手指之间，终止于肘部。

The lapse in concentration was all Zeruel needed as the AT field closed, cutting the arm clean off. The boy was used to pain by now, but it didn't make it any less excruciating, especially when the black tendrils of the Angel wrapped themselves around the EVA's remaining limbs.  
正是这短暂的注意力分散，给了零尔可乘之机，AT 力场一合，将手臂齐根切断。少年对疼痛已习以为常，但这并未减轻丝毫的痛苦，尤其是当天使的黑色触须缠绕在 EVA 残存的四肢上时。

Falling Unit-01 about, it was thrown back and forth against the ground, over and over again, till he was sent flying into one of the ruined structures that littered the GeoFront.  
零号机被甩得翻滚不已，一次次地被抛向地面，最终被猛地掷入地底都市中一处废墟之中。

The Angel, clearly content with its job, proceeded to continue its path of destruction further into the earth.  
天使显然对自己的工作感到满意，继续深入地底，肆意破坏。

ʡʘʘʢ

Misato couldn't comprehend it.  
美里无法理解这一切。

The Angel had absorbed Unit-00. It had _eaten_ an EVA.  
使徒已经吞噬了零号机。它吃掉了一台 EVA。

And now the defense system surrounding central dogma couldn't distinguish it from an EVA, from Unit-00. They would have to manually activate the self-destruct.  
而现在，围绕中心教条的防御系统无法将其与 EVA，与零号机区分开来。他们将不得不手动激活自毁程序。

"Should we activate the self-destruct sequence?" Ritsuko mumbled, clearly at a loss for words.  
"我们应该启动自毁程序吗？" 律子喃喃自语，显然无言以对。

They had thrown every EVA they had at this Angel and it still refused to go down, she had watched as it fought Unit-02, then taken a direct hit from an N2 blast.  
他们已经把所有能用的 EVA 都投入了对付这个使徒的战斗，但它依然不肯倒下，她亲眼看着它与二号机搏斗，然后承受了一次 N2 炸弹的直接攻击。

Finally… it had all but manhandled Shinji in the Geofront…  
最终……它几乎在 Geofront 中对真嗣动手动脚……

Looking down at the console… was no other way.  
低头看着控制台……别无他法。

"Start Sequence." She muttered, her head low, this would be it for them.  
“启动序列。”她低声说道，头低垂着，这对他们来说将是决定性的一刻。

Everyone in the room had been briefed on this exact scenario, there was only a stillness that could not be replicated anywhere else.  
房间里的每个人都已被告知过这种确切情况，只有一种无法在别处复制的静谧弥漫其中。

"Activating self dest…" Makoto stopped, "The MAGI…"  
"启动自毁程序…" 真琴停了下来，"MAGI…"

"All of them?" she breathed, unable to comprehend what she was seeing. Each of the AIs refused the command, a single unilateral decision.  
"全部吗？" 她喘息着，无法理解眼前的一切。每个 AI 都拒绝了命令，这是一个单一的集体决定。

But why? 但为什么？

There was no why not for her now, no answers, instead, the command center shook once again as the white arms then face of the 10th Angel broke through the far wall, made of reinforced concrete and armor like it was wet paper.  
对她而言，此刻已无“为何不”的疑问，亦无答案，取而代之的是，指挥中心再次震动，第十使徒那白色的手臂与面孔如穿透湿纸般，轻易突破了远端那由钢筋混凝土与装甲构成的墙壁。

The massive creature drew closer to them, its eye shining and signaling its attack.  
庞大的生物向他们逼近，眼中闪烁着光芒，预示着攻击的来临。

Silently, Misato thought back to all that had transpired. How could she have been so happy for her two wards less than a day ago and now both were gone.  
无声地，美里回想起所发生的一切。就在不到一天前，她还在为她的两个孩子感到无比幸福，如今却都已离去。

She apologized, begging for their forgiveness in failing them, failing to be the one they could depend on, the one they needed.  
她道歉，恳求他们的原谅，因为她未能成为他们可以依靠的人，未能成为他们需要的那个人。

She didn't even bother registering the curses thrown at the creature by others in the command center, she just relaxed, gripping the white pendant around her neck.  
她甚至没去在意指挥中心里其他人对着那怪物发出的咒骂，只是放松下来，紧握着颈间的白色吊坠。

This would be it. 就是这里了。

Until a violet hand grabbed the shoulder of the Angel.  
直到一只紫色的手抓住了天使的肩膀。

Thousands of tons of armor plating and concreate screeched as they were shattered by the hulking mass of Unit-01, who violently whipped the Angel backward, causing its attack to be directed upwards and to the right of their group.  
成千上万吨的装甲板和混凝土在零号机庞大的身躯下发出刺耳的碎裂声，它猛地将天使向后甩去，使其攻击偏向了他们右侧的上方。

"SHINJI!" She couldn't help but yell in wild jubilation, he had come back.  
“真嗣！”她情不自禁地欢呼起来，他回来了。

Somehow… he always came back.  
不知为何……他总是能回来。

The dust cloud from the two combatants blew towards the group in the command center, the wild grappling of two enclosed fighters tore through wall after wall of hardened steel.  
两位战士激战扬起的尘云向指挥中心的人群袭来，两名近身搏斗的战士撕裂了一堵又一堵坚固的钢墙。

Just as Unit-01 had rushed in, she heard Shinji shout over comms, "Launch!" it was more an order than an ask, but she knew exactly what he wanted.  
正当初号机冲入战场时，她听到真嗣通过通讯器大喊：“发射！”这命令的语气多于询问，但她完全明白他的意图。

"Unit-01's Launch Pad!" she barked, an order that was immediately complied with, sending the two towering figured towards the surface.  
“初号机发射平台！”她厉声命令，这一指令立即被执行，将两具高大的身影送往地表。

Perhaps now the real fight would begin.  
或许真正的战斗现在才要开始。

ʡʘʘʢ

If one were so unlucky enough as to find themselves failing to reach a shelter in time, yet be fortunate to survive the initial onslaught of the 10th Angel, they would be facing an impossible stillness of a city seemingly on the cusp of death, where not even the cicadas sang their familiar tune.  
倘若某人不幸未能及时抵达避难所，却又幸运地在那第十使徒的初次猛攻中幸存下来，他们将面对一座仿佛濒临死亡边缘的城市，那令人绝望的静谧，连蝉鸣都已不再熟悉。

They would find themselves in the stretching shadows of ruins, cast long by the dipping sun and viewing an indeterminable vista of devastation. A city mutilated, with skyscrapers shredded like grass by the destructive force of the Angel.  
他们将置身于残垣断壁的拉长阴影中，夕阳低垂，映照出一片难以估量的废墟景象。城市被摧毁得面目全非，摩天大楼如同被使徒的破坏力撕裂的草叶般支离破碎。

Once the shaking ground would stop, there would be no sound of life, nothing to replace the thunder of the city, all that was left was a stillness, reminiscent of a catacomb, as one's footsteps might reverberate off the dead walls and shattered windows, a last rhythmic breath of the once-great city.  
当地面震动停止后，生命之声荡然无存，城市的雷鸣不复存在，留下的只有墓穴般的寂静，每一步都可能在死寂的墙壁和破碎的窗户间回响，这是昔日伟大城市最后的节奏呼吸。

And in their ear, they might hear the faintest of words.  
而在他们耳边，或许能听到最微弱的细语。

"And this is Tokyo-03." says a melancholy voice, only to be blown away by the rush of two towering figures, shooting up from the GeoFront deep below ground, entangled in a seemingly endless struggle.  
“这里是东京-03。”一个忧郁的声音说道，随即被两道从地下深层 GeoFront 冲天而起的巨大身影所淹没，它们纠缠于一场看似永无止境的斗争中。

"And this is Tokyo-03." “这里是东京-03。”

They would witness the end of a city.  
他们将见证一座城市的终结。

ʡʘʘʢ

Separating from Zeruel mid-flight, Shinji willed Unit-01 into a roll, trying to lessen the shock of landing he touched down on what was left of central Tokyo-03.  
在空中与零号使徒分离后，真嗣操控初号机翻滚，试图减轻着陆时的冲击，最终降落在残存的东京-03 中心区域。

He looked around; the devastation was second only to that of the carnage left by Unit-00s self-destruction in his first life. At least there were buildings still standing, there was nothing but a lake left behind after Rei had sacrificed herself to defeat Armisael.  
他环顾四周；这里的破坏程度仅次于他第一世中零号机自爆留下的惨状。至少还有建筑物屹立不倒，而绫波牺牲自己击败亚米沙尔后，留下的只是一片湖泊。

"_C'mon, you should have ended this by now!" Asuka bemoaned in his ear. As much as he hated a back-seat driver, she was right, this one was not the typical Zeruel he was accustomed to._  
“快点，你早该结束这一切了！”明日香在他耳边抱怨道。尽管他讨厌被人指手画脚，但她的确说得没错，这个使徒并非他习惯对付的典型零号使徒。

Jumping out of the way, the buildings behind him were reduced to clouds of dust by an AT field from said Angel. Shinji glanced up at the time left as he took cover being a still standing skyscraper. Taking a breath, he glanced up at his remaining time.  
闪避到一旁，他身后的建筑被那只使徒的 AT 力场化为尘埃。真嗣一边寻找掩护，躲进一座依然屹立的摩天大楼，一边瞥了一眼剩余时间。他深吸一口气，抬头看向自己剩下的时间。

30 seconds. 30 秒。

That was all he had… it might as well be nothing.  
这就是他所拥有的全部……几乎等同于零。

That thought was cut short by the upper half of the building exploding, Shinji braced himself as it fell onto his EVA, trying to protect himself with his AT Field as his vision was reduced to blackness.  
这一念头被建筑物上半部分的爆炸打断，真嗣紧绷着身体，眼看着它砸向自己的 EVA，试图用 AT 力场保护自己，而视线随即陷入一片漆黑。

Well, now was as good a time as any.  
嗯，现在正是时候。

"Yui…" he breathed, closing his eyes and controlling his breathing. He let go of the controls, allowing himself to slip back into the EVA.  
"唯……" 他轻声呼唤，闭上眼睛，调整呼吸。他松开了操纵杆，任由自己重新融入 EVA。

His would-be mother was waiting for him, almost too eager to swirl up and encompass the boy who now reached out to her.  
他那未来的母亲正等待着他，几乎急不可耐地想要旋转着包围那个此刻向她伸出手来的男孩。

He held nothing back, just as he had done before leaving the entry plug hours before, and just as she had done before, Yui refused to leave him. She rushed forwards and surrounded him, the feeling was intoxicating, this little show of motherly love.  
他毫无保留，正如数小时前离开驾驶舱时那样，而她也同样，绫波不愿离开他。她冲向前去，将他包围，这种母爱的展现令人陶醉。

Shinji felt a sudden jolt of energy flow through him. Outside, the armor encompassing the EVA began to glow a red where green should be and his vision exploding into light as his AT field shot forwards, blowing the rubble and debris off of him.  
真嗣感到一股突如其来的能量涌遍全身。外部，包裹着 EVA 的装甲开始在应有的绿色位置泛起红光，他的视野被光芒吞没，AT 力场向前爆发，将周围的碎石瓦砾一扫而空。

Standing straight, the boy opened his eyes, not knowing that they were beginning to have a red hue.  
少年挺直身躯，睁开双眼，却未察觉到它们正逐渐染上红色。

"Let's end this…" “让我们结束这一切…”

Launching Unit-01 upright and into the air, the Angel wasn't prepared for the sudden burst of energy from the Evangelion. It recoiled, hiding behind an AT field while shooting out two tendrils at the armored titan.  
将初号机垂直发射升空，使徒对来自福音战士的突然能量爆发毫无准备。它后退并躲在绝对领域后，同时向装甲巨人射出两条触手。

Dodging the first, Shinji grabbed the second one, using it to pulling Unit-01 down and towards the Angel with Unit-01s remaining arm.  
闪避了第一条，真嗣抓住第二条，利用它将初号机拉下并朝着使徒的方向拖去，用初号机剩下的手臂。

Zeruel's AT field was still up, leaving the boy to collide feet first with it, luckily his plan wasn't to attack right that second. Instead, he brought down his own AT field, slicing off the tendril and jumping away.  
零的 AT 力场依旧坚挺，男孩一脚撞上，幸好他并未打算立即发起攻击。相反，他释放出自己的 AT 力场，切断了触手，随即跳开。

Sliding down the street as Unit-01s feet slowed him, Shinji brought the piece up to the stump of Unit-01s arm, attaching it.  
真嗣顺着街道滑行，初号机的双脚减缓了他的速度，他将那块碎片举到初号机断臂的残端，将其接上。

Much to his surprise, instead of grafting onto the EVA, it simply attached, and began to pulsate, not quite taking the form of a forearm, until a golden glow began to surround it, forcing it into the shape of a hand.  
令他惊讶的是，这块碎片并未像移植般融入 EVA，而是简单地附着上去，开始脉动，并未完全形成前臂的形状，直到一圈金光开始环绕它，迫使其变成了手的模样。

Flexing the fingers, it seemed to work, looking back just in time, he raised his barrier, blocking a set of four tendrils that slammed into the field with enough force to level adjacent buildings.  
他弯曲手指试了试，似乎有效，及时回头一看，他举起了屏障，挡住了一组四根触手，这些触手以足以夷平相邻建筑的力量撞击在力场上。

The retracted, only for Zeruel to lift an entire remaining skyscraper and launch it at the Evangelion.  
触手收回，紧接着零号使徒举起了一座剩余的摩天大楼，向福音战士投掷过去。

Shinji gritted his teeth, weathering the blow as a dust plume from the disintegrating building, surrounded Unit-01.  
真嗣咬紧牙关，承受着冲击，建筑崩解产生的尘埃云包围了初号机。

Rushing forwards, Zeruel was again taken by surprise, unable to raise any protection in time. Unit-01's arms grabbed its face and launched it towards the massive hole it had punched through the earth and into the GeoFront.  
急速前冲的零尔再次措手不及，来不及升起任何防护。初号机的双臂抓住它的脸，将其猛地抛向自己先前贯穿大地、直通地底都市的巨大洞口。

Following it, the Third Children latched onto it in the air, grappling it, and sending them both down deep into the underground dome below.  
紧随其后，第三适格者在空中紧紧抓住它，与之缠斗，双双坠入下方的地下穹顶深处。

They would end this where it began.  
他们将在一切开始的地方终结这一切。

ʡʘʘʢ

Misato could only stare at the two colossal figures as they fell from the top of the dome, like falling stars.  
美里只能目瞪口呆地看着那两个巨大的身影从穹顶上方坠落，宛如流星般。

Unit-01's violet body was now accented by glowing red lines where green should be. It clawed at the body of the Angel as they fell, their limbs intertwined with Unit-01 tearing chunks out of the angel as they fell.  
零一机那紫色的身躯现在被本应是绿色的地方发出的红光线条所点缀。它一边坠落，一边用爪子撕扯着使徒的身体，双方的肢体交缠在一起，零一机撕下使徒的肉块。

Their little group has evacuated the command bridge, finding their way through rubble-filled halls and dark corridors, they had found an exit to the GeoFront just in time to witness the sight.  
他们的小团队已经撤离了指挥桥，穿过满是瓦砾的大厅和黑暗的走廊，及时找到了通往地表的出口，正好目睹了这一幕。

"It's impossible…" Ritsuko mumbled. The scientist was monitoring Unit-01 through a portable laptop.  
"这不可能……" 律子喃喃自语。这位科学家正通过一台便携式笔记本电脑监控着初号机。

"What's happening to Unit-01?" The colonel barked at the blonde, who simply shook her head.  
"初号机怎么了？" 上校对金发女郎厉声问道，而她只是摇了摇头。

"I have no idea." The woman breathed, looking up at the falling titans.  
"我也不知道。" 女子喘息着，抬头望向坠落的巨人。

The ground shook at the force of their impact, while everyone braced themselves for the shockwave that hit them moments later. From the dust cloud, Misato could make out the two of them, still battering away at each other.  
地面在他们撞击的力道下震颤，众人随即紧绷身体，准备迎接片刻后袭来的冲击波。尘埃弥漫中，Misato 依稀辨认出两人仍在激烈互殴的身影。

Misato watched as the Angel was hit back and forth… was that?  
Misato 注视着天使被来回击打……那是？

"Two AT Fields?" the words were barely a whisper.  
"两个 AT 力场？" 这话几乎细不可闻。

"I'm not sure," the scientist looked down at her readings "that shouldn't be possible!"  
"我不确定，" 科学家低头看着她的读数，"这不可能啊！"

The Angel was slowly pushing itself up, falling back down over and over while Unit-01 lumbered forwards, the red lines on its body pulsating with each step. Misato watched as the muscles, typically hidden by pieces of armor, flexed as it passed them, so much of the armor had been sheered or blasted off in the fight, it looked like the EVA would be out of commission for months.  
使徒缓缓地试图起身，却一次次跌倒，而零号机蹒跚前行，身上的红线随着每一步脉动。美里看着那些通常被装甲遮盖的肌肉在它经过时紧绷，战斗中许多装甲已被削去或炸飞，看起来 EVA 需要停机维修数月。

Her eyes widened as over its head; a halo began to form.  
她的眼睛睁大了，只见它头顶上方；一个光环开始形成。

"The plug depth is exceeding 180!" Ritsuko exclaimed, the alarm in her voice perfectly clear to all those present. "He needs to stop! He won't be able to come back!"  
“插入深度超过 180 了！”律子惊呼，她的声音中的警报对在场所有人来说再清楚不过了。“他必须停下来！否则他将无法返回！”

But he promised. 但他承诺过。

Shinji had promised her, he had promised her he would always come back.  
真嗣曾向她承诺过，他承诺过他会永远回来。

He never broke that promise.  
他从未违背那个承诺。

"You can do it Shinji!" she shouted, her voice seemed so small and insignificant as the giant lumbered past, "Asuka would want you to do it, save everyone!"  
“你能做到的，真嗣！”她喊道，当巨人蹒跚而过时，她的声音显得那么渺小而无足轻重，“明日香会希望你这么做，拯救所有人！”

As those words left her mouth, the world exploded in purple light.  
随着这些话从她口中说出，世界在紫光中炸裂。

ʡʘʘʢ

Could he hear them? Of course, he could, but what did they know?  
他能听见吗？当然能，但他们又知道些什么呢？

Ritsuko shouting for him to stop was laughable at this point. She had no idea what was possible with an EVA, let alone what he could do with one.  
此时此刻，律子喊着让他停下显得颇为可笑。她根本不知道 EVA 能做到什么，更别提他能用 EVA 做什么了。

He felt a tug from Yui, and just then his world exploded in violet light, as beams shot out eviscerating the hasty protection Zeruel had brought up to shield itself.  
他感觉到来自 Yui 的牵引，就在那一刻，他的世界在紫光中爆炸，光束射出，撕裂了 Zeruel 匆忙升起的防护罩。

A bit of its own medicine.  
以其人之道还治其人之身。

As Unit-01 approached the smoldering figure of the Angel, Shinji knew what he was going to do, even if he didn't know exactly how he would do it.  
当初号机接近那冒烟的天使身影时，真嗣知道他要做什么，即使他并不确切知道该怎么做。

"_Go on, kill it!" Asuka grumbled, it had been a spectacular fight, but now it was finished, all that was left was clean up._  
“快点，解决它！”明日香咕哝着，这场战斗曾如此壮观，但如今已落下帷幕，剩下的只是清理残局。

"No." "不。"

"_What?"_ “什么？”

"I need to get Rei." He said, leaning down, and tearing the boney spikes that protected the Angel's core.  
"我得去找丽。" 他说着，俯下身，撕裂了保护使徒核心的骨刺。

"_What the hell are you talking about?" she was yelling in his ear now, "She's expendable and you can't get her back!"_  
"你到底在说什么鬼话？" 她在他耳边吼道，"她是可牺牲的，你救不回她的！"

"She's not expendable…" he mumbled, "neither of you are."  
"她不是可牺牲的……" 他喃喃道，"你们都不是。"

"I won't lose both of you, not now… I have to try."  
"我不能失去你们两个，现在不行……我必须尝试。"

The view in the entry plug began to morph, bright colors began to flow from front to back, creating an oncoming shower of color.  
驾驶舱内的视野开始变形，明亮的色彩从前至后流动，形成了一片迎面而来的色彩雨。

Yui nudged him, guiding him as Unit-01's arm reached down into the Angel's core, trying to do something, anything. Shinji could pull himself from a core, hell, once he pulled Asuka out of Unit-02's core, but now? He was flying blind.  
Yui 轻轻推了他一下，引导着初号机的手臂伸入使徒的核心，试图做些什么，任何事情。真嗣曾从核心中救出自己，甚至有一次他从二号机的核心中救出了明日香，但现在？他完全是盲目的。

At least until he heard the voice.  
至少在他听到那个声音之前。

"It's no use." Rei's voice floated into the entry plug "I cannot exist anywhere but here now."  
"没用的。" 丽的声音飘进驾驶舱，"我现在只能存在于这里。"

"Besides," the red-eyed girl explained, "I am replaceable."  
"而且，" 红眼女孩解释道，"我是可以被替代的。"

"NO!" he shouted "I can save you! I can save all of you!"  
"不！" 他喊道，"我能救你！我能救你们所有人！"

He found himself plunging into the core, just as he had a countless number of times, his sync ratio passing the threshold. Yui's essence guided him, all the while stopping, seeming to ask 'is this what you want?'.  
他发现自己再次深入核心，就像无数次那样，同步率越过了临界点。唯的精髓引导着他，同时似乎停顿了一下，仿佛在问：'这是你想要的吗？'。

"_Shinji, I don't know if this is a good idea…" he heard Asuka call from behind him, but he ignored it._  
"真嗣，我不确定这是个好主意……" 他听到身后明日香的声音，但他置之不理。

Shinji pushed onwards like he was plunging deeper into the bottomless pool, diving deeper and deeper. He doubted he had ever pushed himself that far, there had been no reason to before, no need to delve so close to the heart of an EVA.  
真嗣继续前进，仿佛正深入无底深渊，越潜越深。他怀疑自己从未如此拼命过，以前没有理由，也没有必要如此接近 EVA 的核心。

Finally, he could see Rei, he could see her deeper in the void he kept going deeper and deeper into.  
终于，他能看到绫波了，她在他不断深入的虚空中更深处。

Finally, he was forced to stop, a barrier causing him to bounce backward, invisible only decerable to his touch as he tried to force himself forwards.  
最终，他被迫停下，一道屏障让他反弹回来，无形无色，唯有触摸才能感知，当他试图强行前进时。

"Not… both of you…. not… you… too!" He shouted as he forced his way through the barrier, tearing it to pieces and pushing past it.  
"不是…你们两个…不是…你也！" 他咆哮着，强行穿过屏障，将其撕成碎片，推挤而过。

Here the area around him hurt, it burned, it felt like he was submerged in acid as he reached out to the girl.  
在这里，他周围的一切都让他感到痛苦，灼烧，仿佛被浸泡在酸液中，当他伸出手去触碰那个女孩时。

"Take my hand!" he shouted, as the pale girl began to lift her hand, reaching out and latching onto him. He couldn't see the SDAT player she was holding in her other hand.  
"抓住我的手！" 他喊道，那苍白的女孩开始抬起手，伸向他并紧紧抓住。他看不见她另一只手握着的 SDAT 播放器。

"Why?" "为什么？"

He would explain to her later, he could tell both of them, after this stunt there was little chance of him explaining everything away, he just hoped they all could keep a secret, however unlikely.  
他打算稍后再向她解释，他可以告诉他们俩，经过这次鲁莽的举动，他几乎没有机会把一切都解释清楚，他只是希望他们都能保守这个秘密，尽管可能性微乎其微。

Pulling back, he pushed himself towards the surface, Rei in tow, who knew exactly what would happen when they breached the 'surface'. Would she be in his entry plug? Would she just be another soul in Unit-01?  
他向后退去，将自己推向水面，丽紧随其后，她清楚当他们突破水面时会发生什么。她会在他的插入栓里吗？还是会成为初号机中的另一个灵魂？

All Shinji knew was he had her, he had saved her. He failed to save Asuka and he would never forgive himself, but he was relieved he wouldn't have Rei's death on his mind this time too.  
真嗣只知道他救了她，他救了丽。他没能救出明日香，他永远无法原谅自己，但他庆幸这次不必再承受丽死亡的阴影。

He wouldn't lose them both.  
他不会失去他们两个。

Passing through that barrier that had separated Rei, he felt a tug in his gut.  
穿过那道曾将丽与外界隔绝的屏障，他感到腹部一阵拉扯。

Before a familiar pain shot through him.  
紧接着，一股熟悉的痛楚贯穿全身。

Letting go of Rei at the stab of pain, he screamed in agony at the familiar burn brought on by a spear of Longinus.  
在剧痛中松开丽的手，他因那熟悉的朗基努斯之矛带来的灼烧感而痛苦嘶吼。

But why was he feeling that here? How was he feeling that here?  
但为何他在这里会有这种感觉？他又是如何在这里感受到这种感觉的呢？

Looking back, Rei was gone, and that same pain was still there, pulsating in his gut. Pushing himself up towards the surface, the boy was exhausted, but he needed to get himself out, he needed to get back.  
回首往事，丽已经离去，那份同样的痛苦依旧在腹中悸动。他奋力向上游去，男孩疲惫不堪，但他必须自救，他必须返回。

He rocketed forwards, determined to find himself in the entry plug once more. The 'surface' was just above him; he was almost there!  
他疾速向前冲去，决心再次回到插入栓内。那‘水面’就在上方；他几乎就要触及了！

Before he slammed into something.  
就在他猛然撞上某物之前。

Confused, he tried again, pushing against whatever was blocking his way, an invisible barrier much like that which had kept him initially from Rei. He pounded against it, clawed at it, raged at it, did everything he could to force himself upwards and out of the core. He called out to Yui, whose presence had disappeared as soon as the pain had manifested itself in his gut.  
困惑中，他再次尝试，用力推开阻挡在前方的东西，一道无形的屏障，与最初阻止他接近丽的那道屏障颇为相似。他捶打着它，抓挠着它，对着它咆哮，竭尽所能地想要冲破束缚，逃离核心。他呼唤着唯，她的存在在疼痛在他腹部显现的那一刻便消失了。

But it was no use.  
但这一切都是徒劳。

Shinji just stopped, he was spent, he had nothing left to throw at this invisible wall that was keeping him there, like someone trapped beneath the ice, desperately trying to get to the surface.  
真嗣只是停了下来，他已经筋疲力尽，再也没有任何力量去对抗这道困住他的无形之墙，就像一个被困在冰面下的人，拼命想要浮上水面。

He began to understand. 他开始明白了。

His mind relaxed, as he just felt himself falling backward, sinking deeper and deeper into the core.  
他的思绪放松了，感觉自己正向后倒去，不断沉入核心深处。

There was nothing to do now, Yui was gone, Rei was gone, he had stopped the Angel sure… but now he was stuck here.  
现在无事可做了，Yui 已经离去，Rei 也已离去，他确实阻止了使徒……但现在他却困在了这里。

Even his ghostly companion was silent.  
就连他那幽灵般的同伴也沉默了。

He just relaxed, letting his mind slowly be consumed by the emptiness around him. There were worse deaths than this. He was certain.  
他只是放松下来，任由自己的思绪慢慢被周围的空虚吞噬。总比更糟糕的结局要好。他确信。

Shinji Ikari, Third Children, Pilot of Evangelion Unit-01, had failed… again.  
碇真嗣，第三适格者，福音战士初号机驾驶员，又一次失败了……

**Alright, we made it, hope that was a satisfying conclusion for this first part. We also had a title change, well more like an addition. There's typically confusion when talking about this Relapse or deathbringer374's Relapse, so the titles been changed or i guess modified. Unfortunately, doesn't like special characters in the titles so it'll just be 'Relapse: End, Repeat' while in-chapter, it'll be Relapse:**∣▍**, just so you can specify which is which, the formatting is a bit janky but it works... kinda. Go check out deathbringer's Relapse, I've really enjoyed it so far.**  
好了，我们完成了，希望这第一部分的结局能让你满意。我们还经历了一次标题变更，更确切地说是增加了一个副标题。通常在提及这部作品时，人们会混淆是“Relapse”还是“deathbringer374 的 Relapse”，因此标题进行了调整或修改。遗憾的是，平台不喜欢标题中出现特殊字符，所以它将简化为“Relapse: 结束，重来”，而在chapter中，它会是“Relapse:∣▍”，这样你就能区分两者了。虽然格式有点乱，但勉强能用...算是吧。不妨去看看 deathbringer 的 Relapse，我至今都非常喜欢。

**nacichjuanmanuel – Here's the update!  
nacichjuanmanuel – 更新来啦！**

**So, there was some confusion about this being the 'end'. No, we have a ways to go, but I will be taking a 'break'. It's not a hiatus, that's for sure, I'm still writing, I just want to get most of the next section done before I post anything. I had about 60k words before posting and thought that was about 80% of this first part, turns out it was wrong. That's not a bad thing, stories evolve and change. I want to do the same with the next part, I'd say I'll be back to posting consistently between mid-September and early October. That being said I'm planning on having three or four 'interlude' chapters, just as a show I'm still here. And I could just say screw it and start posting sooner, who knows.  
所以，关于这是否是‘结局’有些混乱。不，我们还有一段路要走，但我将‘休息’一下。这绝不是停更，我仍在写作，只是想在发布之前完成大部分下一章节。我在发布前大约有 6 万字，以为那是第一部分的 80%，结果发现我错了。这并不是坏事，故事会发展和变化。我想对下一部分做同样的事情，我预计会在九月中旬到十月初之间恢复定期更新。话虽如此，我计划有三到四个‘插曲’章节，只是为了表明我还在这里。而且我可能会直接说不管了，早点开始发布，谁知道呢。**

**Until Next Time. 下次再会。**

### Chapter 36: "…For years and years I roamed …"
Chapter 36: "…多年来我四处漂泊…"

### Chapter 36: "…For years and years I roamed …"  
Chapter 36: "…多年来我四处漂泊…"

"AAAAH!" “啊——！”

That familiar painful breath was accompanied by a pulsing ache on his forehead.  
那熟悉的痛苦呼吸伴随着他额头上阵阵的抽痛。

He was on pavement or some sort of concrete, which was rather strange, and the sounds of the city around them also told him they were outside.  
他躺在柏油路或某种混凝土上，这颇为奇怪，而周围城市的喧嚣声也告诉他，他们正身处户外。

Opening his eyes he should have recognized the sound of Rei's voice as the girl was currently grabbing school belongings in a desperate attempt to… wait… was that a piece of toast?  
睁开眼，他本该立刻辨认出丽的声音，因为她正急切地收拾着学校用品，试图……等等……那是一片吐司吗？

The Rei noticed his questioning eyes, and even though he wasn't focused on… the more exposing sight that her skirt was currently giving him, she yelped unceremoniously while pulling it down to hide the sight.  
丽注意到他疑惑的目光，尽管他并未专注于……她裙子此刻展现的更为暴露的景象，她还是不假思索地惊叫一声，急忙拉下裙子遮掩。

"um, haha, sorry about that," she said gathering the last of her things, the piece of toast was disregarded on the ground "I'm sorry about that I didn't mean to run into you!" she shouted as she took off.  
“呃，哈哈，抱歉啊，”她边说边收拾着最后几样东西，那片吐司被丢在地上，“真对不起，我不是故意撞到你的！”她喊着跑开了。

Shinji groaned as he pushed himself upwards, a sense of déjà vu taking him.  
真嗣呻吟着撑起身来，一种似曾相识的感觉涌上心头。

The sound of grumbling drew his attention to someone behind him, looking back, the furrowed brow of Asuka Langely Soryu greeted him.  
身后传来的咕哝声吸引了他的注意，回头一看，只见明日香·兰格雷皱着眉头迎面而来。

"Um… ah…" he could barely make a sentence, what exactly was going on?  
"呃…啊…" 他几乎说不出一句完整的话，这到底是怎么回事？

"C'mon idiot, we're gonna be late for school if we don't get a move on."  
"快点，笨蛋，再不走我们上学就要迟到了。"

"um, school?" he asked, perplexed as she pushed past him.  
"嗯，上学？" 他困惑地问，而她已经从他身边推开走了过去。

"Urgh, don't tell me you got hit too hard on the head, cmon, let's go."  
"呃，别告诉我你也被打得太狠了，快点，我们走吧。"

Deciding it wasn't worth getting into an argument with her, Shinji followed the redhead, making sure not to take the lead. The city was definitely familiar, this was Tokyo-03, but not quite as he knew it.  
觉得和她争论不值得，真嗣跟着红发女孩，确保不走在前面。这座城市确实很熟悉，这是东京-03，但又不完全是他所认识的那样。

It seemed so… peaceful. 这里似乎……很平静。

After the Angels arrived with regularity, the city had always been different, it had always seemed on edge like it was waiting for the next strike. Which of course it was, but the people within the city were much more subdued than the ones he found himself watching now.  
自从天使们定期降临后，这座城市就变得不同了，它似乎总是处于紧张状态，仿佛在等待下一次打击。当然，它确实在等待，但城内的人们比他现在观察到的那些要温顺得多。

They laughed and smiled when they talked instead of the hushed tones he remembered. People could be seen jogging and listening to music instead of staying indoors and making sure they were aware of their surroundings.  
他们交谈时会笑会笑，而不是他记忆中的低声细语。人们可以看到他们在慢跑和听音乐，而不是待在室内确保自己对周围环境保持警觉。

Perhaps ignorance was indeed bliss after all.  
也许无知真的是一种幸福。

Or perhaps the Angels simply were taking their time to get here.  
或许天使们只是不紧不慢地赶路罢了。

The last life he had the pleasure of enjoying was one where they had screwed up the 'fight' against Sahaquiel. It wasn't particularly anyone's fault, the Angel had just moved too fast for them, and it seemed the Evangelions were not up to taking the blast that time.  
他上一次有幸享受的生活中，他们在对抗萨哈奎尔的‘战斗’中搞砸了。这并非任何人的错，只是那位天使移动得太快，而那次福音战士们似乎也未能承受住那一击。

They arrived at classroom 2-A, the school itself didn't seem too different. With plenty of time to spare, Asuka taking her seat directly behind his own which was the same as it always was, right next to the window.  
他们来到了 2-A 教室，学校本身似乎并没有太大变化。时间充裕，明日香坐在他身后的座位上，一如既往，就在窗户旁边。

Sitting down, Shinji rubbed his head, trying to help the lingering pain away just a little more, but to no avail, it also didn't help that two familiar faces were coming over to him, except they were both intercepted by a certain class rep.  
坐下来后，真嗣揉着头，试图稍微缓解一下挥之不去的疼痛，但毫无效果。更糟糕的是，两张熟悉的面孔正朝他走来，却被某个班代表中途拦下了。

Maybe he could just rest for a bit. Putting his head into his arms on the desk, he closed his eyes. Unfortunately, the sound of tires screeching killed any idea that he might actually get to sleep off his headache.  
也许他可以稍微休息一下。他把头埋在桌上的手臂里，闭上了眼睛。不幸的是，轮胎刺耳的摩擦声粉碎了他可能睡一觉缓解头痛的念头。

"Oh yeah, Miss Misato our teacher!" he heard Toji shout, as the window in front of him was thrown open.  
“哦对，我们的老师，美里小姐！”他听到东治喊道，与此同时，他面前的窗户被猛地推开了。

"_Oh, Miss Misato is here!"_  
"哦，美里小姐来了！"

So that's why this felt so familiar…  
难怪这感觉如此熟悉……

Memories of a different world flooded back, one where remembered the euphoria of a life without Angels, witnessing the possibilities of a normal life. He couldn't have known he would see it again, that he would actually live it.  
另一个世界的记忆涌上心头，那里没有使徒，他曾体验过普通生活的喜悦。他未曾料到会再次见到这一切，真正地活在其中。

And he knew that he was nowhere near deserving of this either.  
他也明白，自己远未配得上这一切。

He didn't deserve to be here, not when he hadn't succeeded yet, not when he had just failed over and over.  
他不该在这里，毕竟他尚未成功，毕竟他一再失败。

But what if this was it?  
但万一这就是结局呢？

What if this was where the cycle finally ended?  
如果这就是循环最终结束的地方呢？

The idea was tantalizing enough, the thought that he not only would finally be able to live, but he wouldn't even have to fight in an EVA for it. There would be nothing here to hurt them, nothing to save Rei from, no trauma that he would have to help Asuka move on from.  
这个想法足够诱人，他不仅终于能够活下去，甚至不必为此驾驶 EVA。这里没有任何东西会伤害他们，没有需要拯救丽的事情，也没有他必须帮助明日香克服的创伤。

He could be a normal kid again.  
他又能成为一个普通的孩子了。

Though what did that even mean?  
尽管那到底意味着什么？

'Normal' for him was fighting towering Angels, cleaning a trashed apartment, going to sync tests, and nearly dying on average at least once a month. At best his life before being summoned by his father was 'normal', but even then, he lived in a world that had dealt with the Second Impact.  
对他来说，'正常'意味着与高耸的使徒战斗，打扫被毁的公寓，参加同步测试，以及平均每月至少濒临死亡一次。在他被父亲召唤之前的生活充其量算是'正常'，但即便如此，他生活在一个已经经历了第二次冲击的世界。

The shouting of Hikari for them to stand up and bow to begin their day rang through his ears as he went through the motions without really giving them any thought.  
随着他机械地完成这些动作，脑海中并未真正思考，光希让他们站起来鞠躬以开始一天的呼喊声在他耳边回响。

Even the sight of Misato didn't really shock him, be it the memory of the glimpse he had been given, or the fact it didn't compare to the sight of a hundred-foot humanoid trying to kill him, there was really no reason for him to be moved.  
即便是美里出现在眼前，也并未让他感到真正的震惊，无论是之前瞥见的记忆片段，还是这景象与目睹一个百米高的巨人试图置他于死地相比实在微不足道，他实在没有理由为之动容。

"Listen up dudes, we got a new blue-haired babe here to introduce herself." The woman energetically explained to the class, as she moved aside to reveal the girl he had crashed into earlier.  
“听好了各位，我们这儿来了位新同学，蓝头发的美女要自我介绍啦。” 女老师充满活力地向全班解释，同时侧身让出位置，露出了之前与他相撞的那个女孩。

"My name's Rei Ayanami, how's it hanging?" Rei exclaimed; her face bright with a smile.  
"我叫绫波零，你怎么样？" 绫波兴奋地说道，脸上洋溢着笑容。

That… was much more disturbing than it should have been.  
那……比应有的情况要令人不安得多。

ʡʘʘ.ʢ

It was so strange seeing Kaji as a teacher, especially the music teacher.  
看到卡吉成为一名老师，尤其是音乐老师，真是太奇怪了。

It really shouldn't have surprised him how good the man was with students, he was more than patient and had a great amount of knowledge for each there.  
他本不该对卡吉与学生相处得如此融洽感到惊讶，他极其耐心，对每种乐器都拥有丰富的知识。

Putting the cello back in the spot he found it, his eyes wandered over the collection of instruments lining the walls. His mind recalled which ones he knew and which ones he still wanted to learn. Each had their own 'personality' it seemed, you had to treat a guitar differently than a flute.  
将大提琴放回原处，他的目光在沿墙排列的乐器间游移。他的脑海中浮现出哪些是他已掌握的，哪些是他仍想学习的。每种乐器似乎都有自己的‘个性’，对待吉他的方式与对待长笛截然不同。

"Hey, Shinji!" Asuka near-shouted as she clapped him on the shoulder. He shouldn't have jumped at something so simple but he did, perhaps it was the feeling of safety this life was giving him.  
"嘿，真嗣！" 明日香几乎是大声喊着，同时拍了拍他的肩膀。他本不该对这么简单的事情感到惊讶，但他确实吓了一跳，或许是因为这种生活给他带来的安全感。

"I'm going to swimming practice, you're gonna wait for me, right?" she asked as he turned around.  
"我要去游泳训练了，你会等我吧？" 她问道，而他转过身来。

"Of course." “当然。”

"Mr. Kaji said he'd be sticking around a bit after class, you could get some more practice in if you wanted to wait for me to do homework." She said, gathering her bag.  
"加治先生说课后他会多留一会儿，如果你想等我做完作业，可以趁机多练习一下。" 她说着，收拾起书包。

"Just try to keep out of trouble." She smirked, which he just nodded.  
"尽量别惹麻烦。" 她微微一笑，他只是点头回应。

Shinji waited as the room emptied, the trickle of students finally leaving him alone with the familiar scruffy man. Kaji seemed… fuller… than usual, probably due to not having to suffer through the aftermath of the Second Impact. It had been a refreshing change of pace to not sit through an entire lecture that revolved solely in the Second Impact, and his textbooks had made no mention of it.  
真嗣等待着房间清空，学生们陆续离开，最终只剩下他和那位熟悉的邋遢男人。加持看起来……比平时更圆润了些，大概是因为不必再承受第二次冲击的余波。不再整堂课都围绕第二次冲击展开，这种变化让人耳目一新，而且他的教科书也未曾提及此事。

Now it was time for the last confirmation.  
现在是最后的确认时刻了。

"Oh, I didn't see you there Shinji, got something you wanted to ask me? I heard you took a pretty rough hit to your head on the way to school, how's it feeling?" he asked, that smile was the same, so warm and inviting, like he could tell him anything and not feel guilty.  
“哦，真嗣，我没注意到你在这里，有什么想问我的吗？我听说你在上学的路上头部受了挺重的伤，现在感觉怎么样？”他问道，那笑容依旧，如此温暖和亲切，仿佛他能告诉他任何事，而不会感到内疚。

Of course, the man had been a spy too, that particular skill did come in handy.  
当然，那人也曾是个间谍，这项特殊技能确实派上了用场。

The boy just walked slowly over to the man, who was cleaning off the mouthpiece of a clarinet. "Can't seem to get everyone to remember they need to be courteous and clean their borrowed pieces huh?" he asked.  
男孩缓缓走向那个正在擦拭单簧管吹嘴的男人。“似乎没法让每个人都记住他们需要礼貌并清洁借用的乐器，是吧？”他问道。

"Yeah, I guess," Shinji replied his mind racing with the knowledge of what he was about to ask.  
“是啊，我想也是，”真嗣回答道，他的脑海中飞速运转着即将提出的问题。

"Mr. Kaji…" “加治先生……”

"Oh Shinji, I told you, just Kaji, I've been your teacher for what, four years now? It's been a while since you called me that."  
“哦，真嗣，我说过，叫我加持就好，我当你的老师已经四年了吧？你很久没这么称呼我了。”

"Kaji…" Shinji corrected, taking a breath, "Does the phrase 'Second Impact' mean anything to you?"  
“加持……” 真嗣纠正道，深吸一口气，“‘第二次冲击’这个词对你来说有什么意义吗？”

He watched the man stop his task and furrow his brow, but ultimately shrug, "Nope, can't say it does, does it have to do with a new manga you're reading?"  
他看着那人停下手中的活，皱起眉头，但最终耸了耸肩，“不，说不上来，这跟你在看的新漫画有关吗？”

Shinji shook his head "No… how about NERV or Evangelions."  
真嗣摇了摇头，“不……那 NERV 或者 EVA 呢？”

"Like the nervous system, wait what's an Evangelion?"  
“像神经系统一样，等等，EVA 是什么？”

"No, N. E. R. V." Shinji said slowly, spelling out the organization he had become so familiar with.  
“不，是 N.E.R.V.” 真嗣缓缓说道，逐字拼出了这个他已熟稔于心的组织名称。

"Sorry, never heard of it."  
“抱歉，从未听说过。”

Shinji blinked. 真嗣眨了眨眼。

No NERV meant no Angels, no Angels meant no EVAs, no EVAs…  
没有 NERV 意味着没有使徒，没有使徒意味着没有 EVA，没有 EVA……

Even if he talked about this, Kaji wasn't the same, he couldn't be the same. He couldn't understand like the Kaji he knew, the one he could always trust to listen to him.  
即便他谈及此事，加持已非昔日模样，再也无法回到从前。他无法像他所熟知的那个加持那样理解他，那个他总能信赖、愿意倾听他的加持。

But still… 但依旧……

The boy wanted to tell someone, he _needed_ to tell someone. He hadn't told anyone in any lives he'd gone through so far. Though to be fair, about a quarter of them were him just figuring out how to survive that first N2 mine.  
男孩想要告诉某人，他需要告诉某人。在迄今为止经历的每一世中，他从未向任何人透露过。不过公平地说，其中有四分之一的时间他只是在努力弄清楚如何在那第一座 N2 矿中生存下来。

How he had done that on sear luck the first time, he would never know.  
第一次他究竟是如何凭借运气做到的，他永远也不会知道。

"Can I tell you something?" he asked finally.  
“我能告诉你一件事吗？”他终于开口问道。

The brief tense in Kaji's figure almost caused Shinji to laugh, the man was probably thinking it would be some childish nonsense that he had to hear every week from students, but this… if anything he needed to see if the man knew something, even the slightest recognition in his eyes, Shinji needed to be sure.  
加治的身体微微一紧，几乎让真嗣笑出声来，这人大概以为又是每周从学生们那里听到的幼稚胡话，但这次……如果有什么不同，他需要确认这男人是否知道些什么，哪怕只是眼中一丝微弱的认同，真嗣必须确定。

"Sure Shinji, you know the school's open-door policy."  
“当然，真嗣，你知道学校的开放政策。”

Yeah, but he was sure they hadn't thought up his situation when they created it.  
是啊，但他确信他们在设计这个情况时并没有想到他。

"I'm… not your Shinji Ikari…"  
“我……不是你的碇真嗣……”

The teacher's face just formed a smile, like it was the beginning of a joke.  
老师的脸上露出了微笑，仿佛这是一个笑话的开端。

"Alright, then tell me who's Shinji Ikari you are?"  
"好吧，那你告诉我，你是谁？你是碇真嗣吗？"

"I know this is going to sound impossible, it's going to sound stupid, but… it's the truth."  
"我知道这听起来不可能，听起来很蠢，但是……这是真的。"

"Alright, go ahead." "好吧，说吧。"

"Where I come from… my first life… something called the Second Impact occurred. It wiped out nearly half of the population…"  
"我来自的地方……我的第一世……发生了一件被称为第二次冲击的事。它几乎毁灭了半数人口……"

He told the man about how his father was the commander of NERV, explaining how he was the pilot of a giant weapon system called Evangelion, how he fought Angels alongside Asuka and the new transfer student Rei Ayanami.  
他向那人讲述了关于他父亲是 NERV 的指挥官，解释了自己是如何成为名为 EVA 的巨型兵器系统的驾驶员，以及他是如何与明日香和新转学生绫波零一起对抗使徒的。

Shinji could tell he didn't believe him, Kaji was just nodding along, smiling at things he couldn't truly understand the context of. Could he really blame him? He couldn't have known how the boy had crushed someone like a bug, or how he had to watch his friend sacrifice herself to stop an Angel.  
真嗣看得出他不相信，加持只是点头附和，对那些他无法真正理解背景的事情微笑。他真的能怪他吗？他不可能知道这男孩如何像碾死一只虫子一样摧毁了某人，或者他不得不目睹朋友牺牲自己来阻止使徒。

He couldn't have known about the screams he was beginning to hear at night… Asuka's screams.  
他不可能知道那些他开始在夜晚听到的尖叫声……明日香的尖叫声。

"So, is this a manga you're writing? I'm enjoying the story so far." He said, leaning in from his chair.  
“所以，你这是在写漫画吗？我目前的故事还挺喜欢的。” 他说着，从椅子上探身过来。

Sighing, the Third Children wasn't even angry, of course, he wouldn't believe him, it wasn't like it made any sort of sense. At least not to someone in a world where there were no such things.  
叹了口气，第三适格者甚至没有生气，当然，他不会相信他，这听起来毫无道理。至少对一个不存在这种事物的世界的人来说是这样。

But something else might change his mind.  
但其他事情可能会改变他的想法。

"Am I a good cello player?" he asked, the idea starting to form in his mind.  
“我是个好大提琴手吗？”他问道，这个念头开始在脑海中成型。

Kaji stifled a laugh, "Are you a good player? Shinji half the other kids gave up trying to learn when they heard you play for the first time, you're pretty advanced for your age."  
加持忍俊不禁，“你是个好手吗？真嗣，其他孩子听说你第一次演奏后就放弃了学习，你这个年纪算是相当进阶了。”

"Alright." He said, marching over to the instrument he had just let down. Taking a seat he readied his bow, and let himself play the song he would never forget.  
"好吧。" 他说着，大步走向刚刚放下的乐器。坐定后，他准备好弓，让自己演奏起那首永生难忘的曲子。

Sixty-Two seconds later he looked back up to see the man's face had gone pale.  
六十二秒后，他抬头一看，那人的脸色已变得苍白。

"How do you know that song?" he asked, clearly uneasy.  
"你怎么会知道那首歌？" 他问道，显然感到不安。

"How do you?" Shinji asked back.  
“你呢？”真嗣反问道。

Kaji shook his head "It doesn't matter, that was very good, probably the best rendition I've heard."  
加持摇了摇头，“这无关紧要，非常出色，可能是我听过的最好的一次演奏。”

Setting the cello back down, Shinji moved down the line to the next one, picking up the guitar he slung it over his shoulder and began to play before the teacher could object. Letting loose another sixty-two seconds of notes, Kaji had made his way up from his seat, watching him intently.  
真嗣将大提琴放回原位，沿着乐器行列走向下一个，拿起吉他背在肩上，开始弹奏，没等老师反对。他又释放了六十二秒的音符，加持已经从座位上站起，专注地看着他。

Again, he moved on, a trumpet, a saxophone, a French horn.  
他又继续前行，经过小号、萨克斯风、法国号。

His hand moved to the next instrument and stopped.  
他的手移向下一个乐器，停了下来。

Shinji's eyes didn't dare touch it; the beauty of the instrument was something he could barely comprehend. It was used sure, but it had been cared for too, the wood still gleamed in places unsullied by human hand, the wood was not warped nor was it devoid of all its finish. The craftsmanship that went into creating the beautiful curves and masterful cuts in the wood was still evident even to his rather untrained eye.  
真嗣的目光不敢触及它；这件乐器的美，他几乎无法理解。它虽是二手的，但也得到了精心的呵护，木材在未被人类触碰过的地方依然闪耀着光泽，既没有变形，也没有失去所有的光泽。即使以他那未经训练的眼光来看，制作这美丽曲线和精湛木工的工艺依然清晰可见。

The violin sitting there was more than beautiful.  
那把静静放置的小提琴，美得超乎寻常。

He moved past it, picking up a flute.  
他绕过它，拿起了一支长笛。

"What, can play all that, but not the violin?" Kaji asked, his voice shaky, it was probably an attempt to inject some sort of humor into the growing unease he was feeling.  
"什么，能玩转那么多，却不会拉小提琴？" 加持问道，声音颤抖，这或许是他试图在不断增长的紧张气氛中注入一丝幽默。

But for him… 但对他来说……

"I never learned." He said, his voice low, "It's not my instrument."  
"我从没学过。" 他低声说，"那不是我的乐器。"

He readied the flute, but before he could play Kaji spoke up "Alright, that's enough, what are you trying to prove exactly?"  
他准备好长笛，但还未等他吹奏，加治便开口道：“好了，够了，你到底想证明什么？”

"I'm not writing a story Kaji, I'm telling you who I am," Shinji explained, putting the instrument back down.  
"我不是在写故事，加持，我是在告诉你我是谁，" 真嗣解释道，把乐器放了下来。

"Shinji, you really want me to believe that you're some… 'pilot' who went around in giant robots?"  
"真嗣，你真的要我相信你是某种……'驾驶员'，驾驶着巨大的机器人到处跑？"

Now that Kaji had said those words Shinji had to admit it sounded ridiculous. And yet he had lived through it, he had failed enough times that it would always be his life, no matter how ridiculous it was.  
既然加持已经说了那些话，真嗣不得不承认这听起来很荒谬。然而他确实经历过这一切，他失败了太多次，以至于无论多么荒谬，这都将成为他生活的一部分。

"Did you meet Misato in college?"  
"你在大学里遇到过美里吗？"

"Huh?" the man's face betrayed how incredibly unnerving it was to hear the boy say that.  
“啊？”男人的脸上流露出听到男孩那番话时难以置信的惊恐。

"And your brother? Is he still alive?"  
“那你哥哥呢？他还活着吗？”

Kaji could only just stare at the boy, there were no words to say. Shinji could practically see his mind scrambling to find some sort of logical explanation. A prank maybe, or he had learned personal details by asking Misato? The Third Children was pretty confident that the man trusted Misato enough not to speculate on that.  
加持只能呆呆地盯着少年，无言以对。真嗣几乎能看见他在脑海中拼命寻找某种合理解释的模样。或许是恶作剧，又或许是通过美里打听到了私人细节？第三适格者相当确信，加持对美里的信任足以让他不会往那个方向猜测。

So finally, he just spoke up again, reluctant acceptance in his voice.  
最终，他再次开口，声音中带着不情愿的接受。

"So, if that's all true… why are you here?"  
“所以，如果这一切都是真的……你为什么在这里？”

Shinji didn't answer, the words were right there on his lips, he wanted to say something, anything, but to admit it… to just admit what he did.  
真嗣没有回答，那些话就在他的唇边，他想要说些什么，任何事，但承认……仅仅是承认他所做的。

"They're gone." “他们走了。”

His voice betrayed how simple those words were. He hadn't said that yet, to anyone, and here he was, a coward confessing it to someone who couldn't even understand a fraction of what that confession meant.  
他的声音泄露了这些话语的简单。他尚未对任何人说过，而此刻，他却在这里，向一个连这份告白意义的一小部分都无法理解的人，怯懦地坦白。

Nearly a hundred lives and he could finally tell someone.  
近百条生命，他终于能向某人倾诉。

"I did it Kaji… I killed them..."  
“我做到了，加持……我杀了他们……”

"Who Shinji? Who did you kill?" alarm filling his words.  
“谁，真嗣？你杀了谁？”他的话语中充满了警觉。

"Everyone." "所有人。"

**Well, that was pleasant, wasn't it? Little first world without EVAs kinda hits different, please note this is not canonically after ch35, this is set early on, hence why he can recount the number of lives as well as the absense of Ghost Soryu. So spoilers…. I'm going to have a spoiler warning at the top the next 3 interlude chapters.  
嗯，这挺愉快的，不是吗？没有 EVA 的小小第一世界感觉就是不一样，请注意这并不是在第 35 章之后，这是早期设定，因此他能够回忆起生命数量以及 Ghost Soryu 的缺席。所以有剧透……我会在接下来的三章间奏顶部加上剧透警告。**

**SHOUTOUTS! 特别鸣谢！**

**YodaMorpheus7 – More than ok I'd say, maybe ok enough to have a conversation with her son?  
YodaMorpheus7 – 我觉得不仅仅是不错，也许好到可以和她儿子聊聊？**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – Thoughts on Final Evangelion you say? Unfortunately, that would be WAY too much for the author's note, but I'll try.  
UltraSpink of Da USA – 你提到《新世纪福音战士》最终篇的想法？遗憾的是，那对于作者的话来说太多了，但我尽量试试。**

**Berix – Thanks! Couldn't keep myself away haha.  
Berix – 谢谢！忍不住不来了哈哈。**

**tomdj1701 – Thanks, I thought it was a bit strange how Zeruel wasn't exactly powered up by absorbing Unit-01 in 2.0. I thought it would make more sense for Shinji to have a challenge.  
tomdj1701 – 谢谢，我也觉得 Zeruel 在 2.0 中没有通过吸收 Unit-01 而明显变强有些奇怪。我认为让真嗣面临一些挑战会更合理。**

**skyf0x – Thank you, don't worry, the goal is every 2-3 weeks to get an interlude chapter out so it's not a drought. I think 3.0 will be much more enjoyable, especially since we don't spend all our time with Shinji…  
skyf0x – 谢谢你，别担心，目标是每两到三周发布一个插曲chapter，所以不会断更。我觉得 3.0 会更有趣，特别是我们不会一直围绕着真嗣转…**

**JIM D. ZAS – Thank you, but you only have to wait a little bit.  
JIM D. ZAS – 谢谢你，但只需稍等片刻。**

**Ikari01 – Thanks for that, I definitely have read better battles haha, but I think it does what it sets out to do.  
Ikari01 – 多谢指点，我确实读过更精彩的战斗哈哈，但我认为它确实达到了预期的效果。**

**Guest – Though… not entirely his fault, not that he wouldn't see it that way.  
Guest – 虽然……不完全是他自己的错，尽管他不会这么看。**

**Dragon5847 – Oh, we aren't even near the Endgame haha.  
Dragon5847 – 哦，我们离终局之战还远着呢哈哈。**

**ghemstro - Shadowfang 格姆斯特罗 - 影牙**

**EvaPilotFair – Thank you, it really means a lot.  
EvaPilotFair – 谢谢你，这真的意义重大。**

**dyinglittelstar – Thank you!  
dyinglittelstar – 谢谢你！**

**spartanman2 – Gave that song a listen, oh we're gonna get some titles from that song, just you wait haha, thanks!  
spartanman2 – 听了那首歌，哦，我们会从那首歌里得到一些标题的，等着瞧吧哈哈，谢谢！**

**NoseGum – Thanks and I'll confirm that theory, it was the Lance that kept him from leaving, figured it was the one thing that both did it in canon and something Shinji, for all his experience, can't really circumvent.  
NoseGum – 谢谢，我会证实那个理论，正是兰斯阻止了他离开，我猜这是原作中既有的情节，也是碇真嗣（尽管他经验丰富）无法真正绕过的障碍。**

**Kempn200252 – Yep, that bonds he's had with people will lead to, some interesting circumstances. For better or worse though?  
Kempn200252 – 没错，他与人们建立的那些羁绊，将会引发一些有趣的情境。但究竟是好是坏呢？**

**Yagami Kuzuki – Haha, at least it makes you feel something right?  
八神邦明 —— 哈哈，至少这让你有所感触吧？**

**Guest (2) – Thanks! 访客（2） – 谢谢！**

**Evangelion 3.0+1.0 Review: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb  
《新·福音战士剧场版：终》影评：或者我如何学会不再忧虑并爱上那颗炸弹**

**Unfortunately, it's hard to really make a review encompassing everything I would like to talk about with this movie, even a tldr version would be a complete mess and not really representative of what I would like to say, but I'll try to keep it short.  
遗憾的是，要写一篇涵盖我想讨论的关于这部电影所有内容的影评实在不易，即便是简短版也难免杂乱无章，难以真正表达我的想法，但我将尽量言简意赅。**

**So first… was it good? Depends.  
所以首先……它好吗？看情况。**

**And that's really my stance, it depends, I'm going to come across as a fence-sitter, but I really have no other way of describing it. The more I think about it, the more I both like and dislike this movie from two different points of view.  
这确实是我的立场，要看情况，我可能会显得犹豫不决，但我真的找不到其他方式来描述它。我越是深入思考，就越是从两个不同的角度同时喜欢和不喜欢这部电影。**

**So let's start off with how it shouldn't be viewed, as a general movie. Now hear me out, when I go into an 80s action film, a Marvel film, or a drama, I expect different things, but more importantly for this movie I** _**EXCUSE**_ **certain things, so let's not look at it in a general movie light.**  
首先，我们不要把它当作一部普通的电影来看待。听我说，当我去看 80 年代的动作片、漫威电影或剧情片时，我期待不同的东西，但更重要的是，对于这部电影，我会原谅某些事情，所以让我们不要用普通电影的眼光来看待它。

**So let's accept that it will be a bit crazy, have a few plot holes for the sake of the plot, or more importantly here, the message.  
所以让我们接受它会有点疯狂，为了剧情或更重要的，为了传达的信息，会有一些情节漏洞。**

**I think I've seen 2 views when it comes to it, both of them accepting it as an** _**Evangelion**_ **movie.**  
我认为关于它的看法有两种，两者都接受它作为一部《新世纪福音战士》电影。

**Importance of the meta message above all else  
元信息的重要性高于一切**

**Importance of the characters above all else  
角色的重要性高于一切**

**Now I want to exclude the whole 'best girl' war that's been raging for over two decades at this point, so let's not include ships, to the best of our ability just to save some time haha.  
现在我不想卷入那场已经持续了二十多年的‘最佳女孩’争论，所以尽量不涉及 CP，只是为了节省时间哈哈。**

**So let me start off by saying, yep, I get it, we got an end to Evangelion as a franchise, and I think it did that well enough. It literally has the final act happening in a place formed by memories, a soundstage and then has a whole prop room devoted to CGI models, it's a bit on the nose. And I dig it, I really do. Do I think it would have been made 10 years ago or if Anno stuck to having a film every 2 years? I don't know. Would it have the same impact? I doubt it. And I think that's something the film will be haunted by too, let's compare it to EoE (and we have to do that now, the two cannot be separated since we literally get NGE footage in the film). I think in 10 years people will not resonate with the film as much as they do now or at least not have the same degree. Think of it like Endgame, will kids who binge the MCU in the future have the same emotional reaction as some of us who grew up watching MCU movies? I doubt it, but does it mean it's bad? By no means.  
所以让我先说一句，没错，我明白，《新世纪福音战士》作为一个系列已经完结，我认为它做得足够好了。它实际上让最终幕发生在一个由记忆构成的地方，一个录音棚，然后还有一个专门用于 CGI 模型的道具间，这有点过于直白。但我喜欢它，真的。我是否认为它会在 10 年前被制作出来，或者如果庵野秀明坚持每两年推出一部电影？我不确定。它会有同样的影响力吗？我怀疑。而且我认为这也是电影会被困扰的一点，让我们把它与《真心为你》（EoE）相比较（现在我们必须这么做，因为两部作品无法分割，我们在电影中直接看到了《新世纪福音战士》的画面）。我认为 10 年后人们不会像现在这样共鸣这部电影，或者至少不会有同样的程度。想想《复仇者联盟 4：终局之战》，未来那些一口气看完漫威电影宇宙的孩子们，会有我们这些从小看漫威电影的人同样的情感反应吗？我怀疑，但这意味着它不好吗？绝非如此。**

**Now… characters. I can attest that for me NGE was so captivating because it was the characters that I loved and watching them go through their journey. The great thing was that the meta message was so perfectly intertwined through the character's arcs and I suspect that's why people are not liking 3.0+1.0. I think the story sacrifices so much for the message and wants you to accept so much new information that it ultimately takes away from it, it also tends to try and clean up the mess of 3.0 which doesn't do it any favors. The 3 acts of the movie seem to be focused on 1 of 3 of our main pilots, but even then, it just kinda feels… lackluster to me. Especially Asuka, who has been very much pushed to the side in the rebuilds (not totally unfairly, movies are a different medium than a show) she claims to be 'grown up' but seems more childish than in 2.0, Rei does Detroit: Becoming Human, but it's not OUR Rei. I get the ending was meant to be very… subjective? Open-ended? Up to Interpretation for Shinji? But even EoE ended on solid ground, even if the kids were realistically fucked afterwards.  
现在……角色。我可以证明，对我来说，《新世纪福音战士》之所以如此吸引人，是因为我深爱着那些角色，并见证他们经历各自的旅程。最棒的是，元信息与角色弧光完美交织，我猜这也是为何人们不太喜欢《终》。我认为故事为了传达信息牺牲了太多，并试图让你接受大量新信息，最终削弱了整体效果，同时也试图清理《Q》留下的混乱，这并未给它带来任何好处。电影的三幕似乎分别聚焦于三位主角之一，但即便如此，对我而言，它总感觉……缺乏亮点。特别是明日香，在《终》中被边缘化（并非完全不公，毕竟电影与剧集是不同媒介），她自称“已长大”，却显得比《破》中更为幼稚；丽上演了一出《底特律：变人》，但那已非我们熟悉的丽。我理解结局本意是极具……主观性？开放性？留给观众对真嗣的解读空间？但即便《真心为你》也落在了坚实的基础上，尽管孩子们之后的生活现实而艰难。**

**In all that was the short version haha, its an end, an interesting end, but not to the Rebuilds, to the Franchise, and it feels that way. But in a way, that's a bit disappointing, so is the vagueness in the resolution for our characters. Was it good? Yes. Was it bad? Yes. It simply depends on what you want from your Evangelion film and I can see both sides having valid points.  
简而言之哈哈，这是一个结局，一个有趣的结局，但并非针对《新世纪福音战士》重制版，而是整个系列，感觉确实如此。但某种程度上，这种处理略显失望，角色们的结局也有些模糊不清。它好吗？是的。它坏吗？也是的。这完全取决于你对《EVA》电影的期待，我能理解双方都有其合理之处。**

**But that's all an opinion, a rather condensed and incomplete opinion.  
但这只是个观点，一个相当浓缩且不完整的观点。**

**Until Next Time. 下次见。**

### Chapter 37: "…Mama's gonna make all of your nightmares come true …"  
Chapter 37: "…妈妈会让你的所有噩梦成真…"

"It's been a while." 好久不见。

Shinji had stayed rather quiet while Misato had taken him to NERV, his only words had been shouted at the woman just before the N2 mine had detonated. Having his flesh melted off by something akin to a small nuclear blast was more than unpleasant, but he hadn't dealt with that feeling for some time.  
碇真嗣在美里带他去 NERV 的路上一直相当沉默，他唯一一次开口是在 N2 地雷爆炸前对那女人大喊。被类似小型核爆的东西熔化肉体绝非愉快的体验，但他已经有一段时间没有处理这种感觉了。

In all, except for correcting her on how to reach the EVA cages, it had been rather uneventful. He thought this just might be the closest life he had in a while.  
总的来说，除了纠正她如何到达 EVA 笼子之外，这一路相当平静。他觉得这可能是他近期最接近正常生活的一次了。

Until that voice. 直到那个声音出现。

It wasn't his father's. 那不是他父亲的。

Looking up, the boy couldn't do anything but stare at her, the sight petrifying him like some indescribable horror.  
男孩抬头望去，除了盯着她，什么也做不了，那景象宛如某种难以言喻的恐怖，让他石化。

Yui. 唯。

"Mother?" he whispered. "妈妈？" 他低声唤道。

He didn't advert his eyes, no, he kept them glued to her. The slight smirk that his father always held was now on her face too, but somehow he could tell there was something different. The apparent disdain for him was missing.  
他没有移开视线，不，他的目光始终紧锁在她身上。父亲常挂的那抹轻蔑的微笑如今也出现在她的脸上，但不知为何，他感觉到有些不同。那份对他明显的厌恶之情似乎不见了。

If she was still here… would things be better?  
如果她还在这里……一切会不会变得更好？

"We're moving out." "我们出发了。"

"Moving out? But Unit-00 is still in cryostasis!" Misato protested "Wait a minute, you're going to use Unit-01?!"  
"出发？但零号机还在冷冻状态！" 美里抗议道，"等一下，你们要用初号机？！"

"There's no other way." "别无选择。"

"Now wait a minute, Ray can't do it yet can he?"  
"等等，雷现在还不能做，对吧？"

He? 他？

"I'll do it," Shinji said, his hand shaking and a plan forming in his mind.  
"我来吧，" 真嗣说道，他的手颤抖着，一个计划在他脑海中形成。

No words were needed, no more explanations were given, he entered into the plug, steeling himself for what was coming.  
无需言语，不再需要解释，他进入了驾驶舱，为自己即将面对的一切做好准备。

If Yui wasn't in here…  
如果唯不在这里……

Sure enough, he felt that unfamiliar presence where his mother should have been once he was in the entry plug and the same anger as always bubbled up in his chest at the thought of the man. Right now, however, he needed to keep that under control, he needed to defeat this Angel and then he could think about what he wanted to do.  
果然，当他进入插入栓时，他感觉到本应是母亲所在之处的不熟悉存在，一想到那个男人，同样的愤怒如往常一样在胸中升腾。然而，现在他需要控制住这种情绪，他必须击败这个使徒，然后才能考虑自己想做什么。

"Launch!" He heard Misato call out as the familiar sensation of him being pushed back into his seat.  
“发射！”他听到美里喊道，熟悉的被推回座位的感觉随之而来。

To say the fight was anticlimactic was an understatement. Despite the constant need to block the thought of his father from his mind, Shinji dispatched the Angel in record time.  
说这场战斗虎头蛇尾都算轻的。尽管需要不断阻止自己想起父亲，真嗣还是以创纪录的时间击败了使徒。

Swift slashes with the progressive knife had torn through the AT field and into the core, leaving him there anxiously wanting to get back to the Geofront and talk with his Mother.  
他用高振动粒子刀迅速劈砍，撕裂了 AT 力场并击中了核心，让他急切地想回到地底都市，与母亲交谈。

A short debrief and ecstatic Misato later, he was standing in what he always knew as his father's 'office'. A much too large room that used glass for the floor, it had more in common with a manga villain's layer than anything.  
短暂的汇报和兴奋的美里之后，他站在了他一直称之为父亲'办公室'的地方。这个房间过于宽敞，地板用的是玻璃，与其说像办公室，倒更像漫画反派的巢穴。

Yet there he stood, his mother leaning back in her chair, and gloved hands intertwined at chest level.  
然而他就站在那里，母亲靠在椅背上，戴着手套的双手在胸前交叠。

"Speak." “说吧。”

"To be completely honest, I was expecting Gendo Ikari."  
老实说，我本以为会是碇源堂。

Even now with his mother in the seat, the room's temperature seemed to drop at the mention of that name, much like it had when he brought up Yui's name to Gendo.  
即使现在他母亲坐在那里，一提到那个名字，房间的温度似乎也随之下降，就像他向碇源堂提起唯的名字时一样。

"Is that supposed to be a joke?" those eyes were now watching him much more closely, like some predator watching some unfamiliar prey.  
“你这是在开玩笑吗？”那双眼睛此刻正更加专注地盯着他，仿佛某种捕食者在观察一个陌生的猎物。

"I've done this before." He explained, gesturing to the room and Geofront below "This, Evas, angels, I know Lilith is in Central Dogma and I know what your goal is."  
"我以前做过这个。" 他解释道，指着下方的房间和 Geofront，"这一切，EVA，使徒，我知道莉莉丝在中央教条区，也知道你的目标是什么。"

Yui said nothing, she just remained pushed back into her chair, eyeing the boy.  
Yui 没有说话，只是静静地坐在椅子上，注视着那个男孩。

"What are you?" "你是什么人？"

"I'm Shinji, no one else," he explained "I'm not like the Fifth Children, I'm human."  
"我是真嗣，没有其他人，"他解释道，"我和第五适格者不同，我是人类。"

For a moment the brown and blue eyes refused to leave each other as a silence fell between them. Internally Shinji was praying to any deity out there that his mother would somehow be easier to deal with than his father.  
有那么一刻，棕色和蓝色的眼睛彼此凝视，沉默在他们之间蔓延。真嗣内心祈祷着，希望母亲能比父亲更容易相处。

"Alright… assuming I believe you… what do you want?"  
“好吧……就算我相信你……你想要什么？”

"I want to do it right this time, I know you want to be the center of the Third Impact. All for Gendo assuming that's still your goal. I just… I don't want it to be me."  
"这次我想把它做好，我知道你想成为第三次冲击的中心。一切都是为了碇源堂，如果那还是你的目标的话。我只是……我不希望那是我。"

That was a complete lie of course. He had no intention of letting that happen, this was him trying to make things go smoother, a way for him to get close to 'the scenario' and hopefully disrupt it from the inside. He just hoped she didn't call his bluff.  
当然，那完全是一派胡言。他根本没有打算让那种事情发生，他这么做只是为了让事情进展得更顺利，是他接近‘剧本’并希望从内部破坏它的方式。他只是希望她不要识破他的虚张声势。

"If you wanted Human Instrumentality to occur, why are you here?"  
"如果你希望人类补完计划发生，为什么你会在这里？"

"I…" his voice caught in his throat, before thinking quickly "I'm tired."  
"我…" 他的声音哽在喉咙里，随即迅速反应道，"我累了。"

"I want… a restful world." He explained, "It's been a long time since I could just… sleep."  
"我想要…一个宁静的世界。" 他解释道，"我已经很久没有能够…好好睡一觉了。"

_That_ hadn't been a lie.  
那并非谎言。

"I can tell you what's going to happen, at least to a degree."  
"我可以告诉你将会发生什么，至少在一定程度上。"

"And what do you want?"  
"那你想要什么？"

God, that was a long list, but he wasn't about to give her anything that could be used as leverage against him. No, the less she knew the better.  
天啊，那清单可真长，但他不打算给她任何可能被用来对付他的信息。不，她知道的越少越好。

"Nothing, just… I want this to be over."  
"没什么，只是……我希望这一切快点结束。"

Again, that icy stare bore into him, but she said nothing, only lowering her gloved hands.  
又一次，那冰冷的目光刺向他，但她什么也没说，只是放下了戴着手套的双手。

"Return tomorrow, we'll discuss more then."  
"明天再来，到时候我们再详细讨论。"

Shinji did his best to compose himself as he turned and left. Once into the hallway he suddenly was aware of his racing heart and the slight shaking of his hands.  
真嗣尽力让自己镇定下来，转身离开。一进入走廊，他突然感觉到自己狂跳的心脏和微微颤抖的双手。

Letting his feet take him where ever they pleased, he allowed his thoughts to race in his head. After a while he was so deep in thought he didn't hear the footsteps behind him.  
任由双脚带他去任何地方，他让自己的思绪在脑海中奔腾。过了一会儿，他陷入了深深的思考，以至于没有听到身后的脚步声。

And it was only after he was on the ground, helpless with muscle spasms did he see the blonde doctor standing over him, taser in hand.  
直到他倒在地上，无力地抽搐时，他才看到那位金发医生站在他上方，手里拿着电击枪。

ʡʘʘ..ʢ

"Is that why you didn't trust me?"  
“这就是你不信任我的原因吗？”

Shinji opened his eyes to the sight of her, his mother, or what would otherwise be his mother. Yui Ikari looked the same as always, the rather small woman was no different than most other lives.  
真嗣睁开眼，看到了她，他的母亲，或者说本该是他母亲的人。碇唯看起来一如既往，这位身材娇小的女性与其他大多数生命体并无二致。

Save for the fact she was currently here and talking with him.  
除了她此刻在这里与他交谈的事实。

"You've been muddling through my memories?" he asked, mildly annoyed, it wasn't like he hadn't shown her how he felt, but it seemed a bit too invasive if he wasn't there beside her when she looked.  
"你一直在翻阅我的记忆？" 他略带不悦地问，他并非没有向她展示过自己的感受，但如果她在他不在身边时窥探，这似乎有些过于侵犯隐私了。

"It wasn't like I had much of a choice, you're in here with me now." She said, surprisingly he detected a bit of sadness in her voice.  
"我并没有太多选择，你现在和我在一起。" 她说，出乎意料地，他察觉到她声音中带着一丝悲伤。

"Hmm," he didn't have anything to truly say to her, words would be wasted at this point. He couldn't escape the core, so maybe this was the end for him, he didn't know if an EVA core could ever break down, after all his mother's plan would've been dampered by the fact the core wouldn't last that long if that was the case.  
“嗯，”他此刻对她无话可说，言语在此刻显得多余。他无法逃离核心，或许这便是他的终点，他不确定 EVA 核心是否能崩溃，毕竟若真如此，他母亲的计划会因核心无法持久而受阻。

So maybe this was just the end of the road for him, wasting away in a core, or at least until it too was destroyed.  
或许这就是他的终点，在一个核心中逐渐消逝，或者至少直到它也被摧毁。

"Did I really do that to you?"  
“我真的对你做了那样的事吗？”

Her words brought him out of his musings.  
她的话语将他从沉思中唤醒。

"Did you do what?" he asked, much more annoyed now.  
"你做了什么？" 他问道，现在更加恼怒了。

"Did I plan for you to go through all that pain and suffering?" she asked, her face falling.  
"我计划让你经历所有那些痛苦和苦难吗？" 她问道，脸色变得沮丧。

Shinji rolled his eyes "Yeah, yeah you did, not only did you leave was me at the ripe old age of 4, you made sure I was there to watch, you wanted me to be the pilot in the first place, but to top it all off, is the why…"  
真嗣翻了个白眼 "是啊，是啊，你确实做了，你不仅在我四岁那年把我丢下，还确保我会在那里目睹一切，你从一开始就想让我成为驾驶员，但最过分的是，还有那个为什么……"

"Why did you do it? Oh wait, so you could travel through space as some 'monument to humanity', yeah that's why." He growled at her.  
“你为什么要这么做？哦等等，这样你就能作为某种‘人类纪念碑’穿越太空了，是吧，就是这个原因。”他朝她咆哮道。

"I…" "我…"

"Go ahead and say you're sorry, go ahead and tell me that it was 'for the good of everyone. It doesn't change the fact that you wanted to end the FUCKING WORLD, but somehow it gets worse, because you wanted _me_ to do it!"  
"尽管说你很抱歉，尽管告诉我那是‘为了大家的利益’。这改变不了你想要终结这个该死的世界的事实，但不知为何情况变得更糟，因为你希望由我来完成这件事！"

.

.

.

"I'm sorry she did that to you Shinji."  
"很抱歉她对你做了那样的事，真嗣。"

He couldn't continue his sentence. Did he believe her? No of course not, but to just hear those words from her, having dreamed about hearing something even close to those words… it was hard for him to resist feeling something other than just hatred for the woman.  
他无法继续说下去。他相信她吗？当然不，但仅仅是从她口中听到这些话，曾经梦想过哪怕接近这些话的情景……这让他难以抗拒除了对她的恨意之外的其他情感。

The woman drew closer, causing him to back away.  
女人越靠越近，他不由得后退。

He never changed. 他从未改变。

Thought it wasn't like he could run away now, here in the core there was nowhere to go, so as she drew closer, he just glared at her, hoping that the visual daggers being sent her way would be enough to stop her.  
虽然现在他无法逃离，在这个核心地带无处可去，所以当她靠近时，他只是瞪着她，希望那些投向她的目光能像利刃一样阻止她。

They didn't, they did nothing to stop her as she pulled him into a hug.  
他们没有，他们什么也没做，任由她将他拉进怀抱。

She crouched down to his level, wrapping him in her arms and pressing him into her.  
她蹲下身来与他平视，用双臂环抱住他，将他紧紧拥入怀中。

"I'm so sorry you had to endure that Shinji; she should have never done that to you." That voice she was using made it sound like she actually cared like she didn't have the same exact plan for him.  
“真对不起，让你经历了这些，真嗣；她本不该那样对你的。”她用的那种语气，听起来好像真的很关心，仿佛她并没有同样的计划对他。

"Then what did you do it for?"  
"那你为什么要这么做？"

"You were never meant to be a pilot, you should have never _been_ a pilot, your father should have looked after you and cared for you. I never wanted this life for you."  
"你本不该成为一名驾驶员，你根本就不应该成为驾驶员，你父亲应该照顾你、关心你。我从没想过让你过这样的生活。"

"Then why did you help SEELE, why did you help any of them, why try and pilot the EVAs!"  
"那你为什么要帮助 SEELE，为什么要帮助他们中的任何一个，为什么要尝试驾驶 EVA！"

"Because… this world… it's filled with such pain… humanity would have torn itself apart eventually, it needed to evolve, to move on. It seems your father… or rather this Gendo Ikari eventually had his own goal in mind."  
"因为……这个世界……充满了如此多的痛苦……人类终将自我毁灭，它需要进化，向前迈进。看来你的父亲……或者说这个碇源堂，最终有了自己的目标。"

"You're saying you didn't want this?"  
"你是说你并不希望这一切发生？"

"I wanted a world where my son would be safe, but I never wanted him to be a pilot."  
我渴望一个能让儿子安然无恙的世界，但我从未希望他成为一名飞行员。

"Then why did you risk it, when you knew what Gendo was?" Somehow this felt too good, having this argument with her, finally telling her how he truly felt, he never thought he would get the chance.  
"既然你知道碇源堂是什么样的人，为什么还要冒险？" 不知为何，与她争论这种感觉太好了，终于有机会告诉她他的真实感受，他从未想过会有这样的机会。

"Did you honestly expect him to just accept your 'death' if things went wrong? Did you really think he would take care of your son; you knew what he was, unless you were blind, or were you just willfully ignorant!"  
"你真的以为事情出了差错，他会接受你的'死亡'吗？你真的以为他会照顾你的儿子吗？你知道他是什么样的人，除非你瞎了，或者你只是故意视而不见！"

"No." she said, looking away, unable to meet his gaze, "I knew exactly what he was… and I loved him anyways...". She looked back up while letting the edges of her lips curled slightly into something of a warm smile, "That's something you know all about, don't you?"  
"不。" 她转过头去，无法直视他的目光，"我完全知道他是什么样的人……尽管如此，我还是爱他……" 她抬起头，嘴角微微上扬，露出一丝温暖的微笑，"这一点你也很清楚，不是吗？"

"She's beautiful…" Yui spoke up,  
"她真美……" 优开口说道，

"What did you say?" "你说什么？"

"She's beautiful, Asuka…."  
"她真美，明日香……"

"You don't get to say her NAME!" he shouted. How dare she even _think_ about her after what she did?  
"你没资格提她的名字！" 他吼道。她怎么敢在做了那些事之后还想着她？

Yui slunk back away from him, a bit disturbed by the outburst.  
由依悄悄地后退，被他的爆发吓了一跳。

"So, you _do_ you blame your mother for not breaking out of the bakelite sooner?" she asked, ah so that's what this was about, she wanted to talk about _this,_ did she?  
"那么，你是不是怪你母亲没有早点挣脱束缚？" 她问道，啊，原来如此，她想谈这个，是吗？

"No… if I had gone to the cages, I would have made it, I would have been able to help her."  
"不……如果我去了笼子那里，我本可以做到的，我本可以帮到她。"

"But…." "但是……"

"THERE IS NO BUT! I. DID. NOT. HELP. HER!" he shouted. "She needed me and what did I do? NOTHING! If I hadn't sat around before that I would have been useful!"  
“没有但是！我。没。有。帮。她！”他吼道。“她需要我，而我做了什么？什么都没做！如果我当时没有闲坐着，我本可以派上用场的！”

Yui said nothing, there was obviously nothing she could do to quell the boy's anger on that particular subject. She just hoped that one day his view would change.  
优什么也没说，显然她无法平息男孩在这个问题上的怒火。她只是希望有一天他的看法会改变。

"Soryu." “惣流。”

"What?" he asked. “什么？”他问道。

"Her name, it was Soryu… after her mother…"  
“她的名字，是 Soryu… 随她母亲…”

"What about it?" "那又怎样？"

"It's nothing, just curious, that's all." She said softly, somehow he didn't believe her, "Did you two meet as children too?"  
"没什么，只是好奇罢了。" 她轻声说道，不知为何，他并不相信她，"你们俩也是小时候认识的吗？"

"What?" “什么？”

"On a visit to Germany, we took you along with us," She smiled, thinking back on the memories they had made there, "the two of you met, though I doubt either of you remember, it was a few months before... I left."  
"有一次去德国旅行，我们带你一起去的，" 她微笑着，回忆起在那里创造的记忆，"你们俩相遇了，不过我怀疑你们俩是否还记得，那是在我离开前几个月的事了。"

"Let me show you," she said, as his world began to shift, the emptiness morphing into something else as his senses were filled one after another.  
"让我来展示给你看，" 她说道，随着他的世界开始转变，空虚逐渐化为另一种形态，他的感官一个接一个地被填满。

His vision changed so that was watching his mother, standing beside a parked motorcade with plenty of personnel running about unloading things.  
他的视野发生了变化，他看到自己的母亲站在一辆停着的豪华车队旁，许多人员正在忙碌地搬运物品。

Around the car came his father, younger and without a beard, but it was clearly him. In his arms was a small squirming child, who was making the man just about as uncomfortable as the boy had ever seen.  
他的父亲从车旁走来，年轻且没有留胡子，但那确实是他的父亲。在他的怀里是一个扭动不安的小孩，那孩子让男人感到相当不自在，这是男孩从未见过的。

Handing the child off to Yui, Gendo breathed a sigh of relief as he went back to the opposite side, meeting up with a gathering crowd. Yui set the child down, letting him stand on his own. Apparently, he was very good at walking at that age, because as soon as his feet were planted he took off, not nearly fast enough to get away from Yui, but enough so that she had to keep up a brisk walking pace.  
将孩子交给 Yui 后，Gendo 松了一口气，回到对面，与聚集的人群会合。Yui 把孩子放下，让他自己站立。显然，他在那个年纪走得非常好，因为脚一着地，他就跑了起来，虽然速度远不足以摆脱 Yui，但也足够让她保持轻快的步伐。

They were in front of some facility, unliked the sleek metal constructions of NERV in Tokyo-03, this place was mainly concrete, with a large set of steps rising up to the main doors. The small version of himself had no desire to climb the stairs, instead 'running' to the side of them, where a tiny head seemed to poke out at the wrong time.  
他们站在某个设施前，与东京-03 的 NERV 那光滑的金属建筑不同，这个地方主要是混凝土结构，有一大段台阶通向主门。小小的自己并不想爬楼梯，而是'跑'向台阶的一侧，那里一个小脑袋似乎在不恰当的时候探了出来。

Crashing into one another, the two of them went to the ground, while Yui stayed back. Shinji could feel what she was thinking, instead of the worry and alarm that he would have expected from a parent, instead, she felt curiosity and a bit of amusement. There was little regard for him, though he knew she was ready to step in if needed, he also knew she wanted to see how he would react to this.  
两人猛地撞在一起，双双倒地，而唯则留在原地。真嗣能感受到她的想法，与预期中父母会有的担忧和惊慌不同，她感到的是好奇和一丝戏谑。她对他并不怎么关心，尽管他知道她已准备好随时介入，但他也明白她想看看他会如何应对这一局面。

Just like a scientist watching some new animal.  
就像科学家观察某种新动物一样。

When didn't she use him to play games?  
她什么时候不利用他来玩游戏？

Annoyance bubbled up in him again, perhaps he was always thought of him as another experiment, or perhaps optimistically she was just naïve. Either way, it bothered him that she hadn't gone to see if he was ok, regardless of how small an accident it was.  
恼怒再次在他心中升起，或许她一直把他当作另一个实验对象，又或许乐观地看，她只是天真无知。无论如何，让他困扰的是，无论事故多么微小，她都没有去查看他是否安好。

He watched as the two children straightened up, brushing themselves off to little effect before they just looked at each other.  
他看着两个孩子站直身子，徒劳地拍打着身上的灰尘，然后只是相互对视。

Shinji heard what he thought was a 'Sorry.' Though it was hard to tell. He couldn't help but snort at the irony of his first-ever words to Asuka in this life being 'sorry'. He also would have laughed if she decided to give him a nice kick or punch to go along with it, but instead, she slunk away after eyeing the adult behind him.  
真嗣听到他以为是'对不起'的声音。虽然很难确定。他忍不住对这讽刺的一幕嗤之以鼻，他这辈子对明日香说的第一句话竟然是'对不起'。如果她决定给他一脚或一拳来配合这句话，他也会笑出声来，但她却在他身后的成人注视下悄悄溜走了。

The child version of himself followed her around the corner, probably expecting to play with his new 'friend', the pain of the previous fall seemingly forgotten.  
孩童时期的自己跟着她转过拐角，大概期待着与新'朋友'玩耍，之前的跌倒之痛似乎已被遗忘。

He heard some barbling voice as Yui rounded the corner, probably a bit of toddler speak, a bit of warmth bubbling up in her chest at the sight of the two of them.  
他听到 Yui 转过拐角时发出一些咿呀学语的声音，大概是幼儿的说话声，看到他们俩的情景，她心中涌起了一丝温暖。

"Asuka." The redhead had replied defiantly, although she continued to back away from the other child while looking up at the adult who was keeping her distance while still watching.  
“明日香。”红发女孩倔强地回答，尽管她继续从另一个孩子身边退开，同时抬头看着那位保持距离却仍在观察的成年人。

Shinji figured she was trying to think up a way to make him go away without drawing the ire of his mother, but he didn't expect clear words out of the young boy's mouth next.  
真嗣猜想她正试图想出一个办法让他离开而不惹怒他的母亲，但他没想到接下来小男孩会清晰地说出话来。

"Whanna play?" "想玩吗？"

**Bet you didn't see that coming! We're halfway through the interlude and I think what I'm going to do is have another week where there's no chapter, then post the last two interludes in the same week, like a Monday/Friday that I used to do so we can hop into 3.0 a bit quicker than anticipated.

**Until Next Time 下次再见**


### Chapter 38: "...We're older now, the light is dim..."  
Chapter 38: "...我们现在长大了，灯光昏暗..."

For some reason this place was so quiet, it was empty, yet somehow relaxing. Any noise no matter how small seemed amplified here, it seemed to grow and morph into something ten times what it should have been.  
不知为何，这个地方异常安静，空无一人，却莫名让人放松。任何微小的声响在这里似乎都被放大了，仿佛它们在增长并变形为原本应有的十倍大小。

Despite everything small church was perfect for him.  
尽管一切都很简陋，这座小教堂对他来说却恰到好处。

With his short break each day he would find himself sitting here, mostly due to the fact that it was quiet and on the rare occasion there was someone else here they never spoke to him. Shinji found the whole situation rather amusing, given the whole 'God's in his Heaven, all's right with the world' slogan NERV adopted, they still had a church here on base.  
每天短暂的休息时间里，他总会发现自己坐在这里，主要是因为这里安静，而且难得有人来时，对方也从不与他交谈。真嗣觉得这整个情况相当有趣，考虑到 NERV 采用了“上帝在天堂，世间一切安好”的口号，他们基地里居然还有一座教堂。

Granted it was in Germany, and the likelihood of this building being here long before the Second Impact was rather high, but it was amusing, nonetheless.  
当然，这里是在德国，这座建筑在第二次冲击之前就存在的可能性相当高，但无论如何，这还是很有趣的。

Germany…. 德国….

That's where he was this time, seemingly switched with the Second Child. Even Unit-01 was here instead of in Japan, perhaps his father just wanted him exiled to the other side of the globe this time around. He wasn't German at all, from his files he could tell he was the same exact boy as originally, all that changed was him being sent to Germany after Yui disappeared into the core. Asuka was sent to Japan, the whole situation was bizarre enough, but he'd been through worse.  
这次他似乎与二号机驾驶员互换了位置，来到了德国。甚至连零号机也在这里，而不是在日本，或许这次他的父亲只想把他流放到地球的另一端。他并非德国人，从档案中可以看出，他与原本的自己完全相同，唯一改变的是在唯消失在核心后，他被送到了德国。明日香则被送往了日本，整个情况已经足够诡异，但他经历过更糟的。

When he first woke up, he was silently thanking every deity imaginable that he was already fluent in the language thanks in no small part to the need to communicate with the Second Child.  
当他第一次醒来时，他默默感谢所有能想到的神明，因为他已经能流利地说这种语言，这在很大程度上要归功于与二号机驾驶员沟通的需要。

"_Blah blah blah," Soryu grumbled, thankfully her words didn't have the same echoing effect in this place "this is so boring, you could be doing anything else but sitting here, you know I have to suffer through this too?"_  
“blah blah blah，”草薙嘟囔着，幸好她的话在这里没有回声效果，“真是无聊透顶，你可以做任何其他事情，而不是坐在这里，你知道我也得忍受这一切吗？”

"Can you be quiet?" he mumbled under his breath, keeping the voice from reverberating in the chapel. He almost reached for the SDAT player in his pocket, he hadn't listened to it for some time, but his companion had been acting up lately, being more brash than usual and he found the only thing that silenced her was the familiar tunes provided by the player.  
“你能安静点吗？”他低声咕哝，尽量不让声音在教堂里回荡。他几乎伸手去摸口袋里的 SDAT 播放器，已经有一段时间没听了，但最近他的同伴变得比平时更鲁莽，他发现唯一能让她安静下来的就是播放器提供的熟悉旋律。

This had to be a dozen or so lives where he had finally accepted that this phantom would be with him permanently. Having to see the product of his greatest failure constantly hadn't done him any favors, other than more motivation to keep going.  
这已经是他第十几次或更多次生命中，他终于接受了这只幻影将永远伴随他。不得不时刻面对自己最大失败的产物，除了给他更多继续前进的动力外，并没有给他带来任何好处。

It was just the witty remarks that annoyed him.  
正是那些机智的言辞让他感到恼火。

"_Just like always, boring, I think I'll just stick with boring Shinji." She said, jumping into the pew behind him._  
“一如既往，无聊透顶，我还是继续和无聊的真嗣待在一起吧。”她说着，跳进了他身后的长椅。

Shinji rolled his eyes at her theatrics and just let his eyes wander over the pages of the book he was reading. Unlike the redhead, he had been quick to adapt to the calligraphy of German, opposed to the kanji he was familiar with. Of course, he was sure it had been a much harder transition for her.  
真嗣对她那戏剧性的举动翻了个白眼，只是让自己的目光在正在阅读的书页上游移。与红发女孩不同，他很快就适应了德文的书法，而不是他所熟悉的汉字。当然，他确信这对她来说是一个更艰难的转变。

Right now, the center of his attention was a field manual for Evangelions, not that he really needed the thing, but he had exhausted the few books his small quarters provided him. It was at least more interesting than rereading Faust.  
此刻，他全神贯注于一本关于福音战士的野战手册，并非他真的需要这东西，只是他那狭小的住处提供的几本书已被他翻阅殆尽。至少这比反复阅读《浮士德》要有趣些。

The opening and closing of doors made him look up from the reading to see the cassock of a priest looking over his altar, inspecting the few ornaments and candles that were still adorned it.  
门的开合声让他从阅读中抬起头，只见一位身着法衣的神父正审视着他的祭坛，检查着上面仅存的几件装饰品和蜡烛。

It seemed there had been a change, this was someone new, he had a few words with the previous clergyman, but after that brief encounter, he hadn't bothered to speak with the aging man again. He preferred the quiet in the building, there was no need for idle chatter.  
看来有了变动，这是位新面孔，他与前任牧师有过几句交谈，但那次短暂的邂逅后，他便没再打扰那位年迈的老人。他更喜欢建筑内的宁静，无需闲聊的打扰。

The man turned to see him there, a lone occupant among the pews. Disregarding the irony, Shinji silently prayed that the man didn't meander his way to him, but it seemed there would be no divine intervention as his footsteps resounded against the walls.  
男人转过身，发现他独自一人坐在长椅间。无视这讽刺的情景，真嗣默默祈祷那人不要朝他走来，但似乎并无神明干预，对方的脚步声在墙壁间回响。

Sighing to himself Shinji closed his manual and prepared for a rather tedious introduction to the holy man.  
叹了口气，真嗣合上手册，准备迎接一段颇为乏味的对这位圣人的介绍。

"May I join you?" he asked politely.  
“我可以加入你们吗？”他礼貌地问道。

The boy noted the strange contrast in the man's face. He seemed older, not quite middle-aged, and the wrinkles conflicted with the youthful smile he was giving him. Those eyes on the other hand… they were old, very old, the glasses he wore did him no favor in hiding that fact.  
男孩注意到男人脸上奇怪的对比。他看起来比实际年龄大，但又不完全是中年，脸上的皱纹与他展现出的年轻笑容相矛盾。而那双眼睛……它们却异常苍老，他戴的眼镜丝毫没有帮助掩盖这一事实。

"Sure." “当然。”

Sliding into the pew in front of him, the greying man rubbed his knees, obviously working away some kind of soreness no doubt from a lifetime of kneeling.  
他滑进他前面的长椅，灰白头发的男人揉着膝盖，显然是在缓解某种因一生跪拜而导致的酸痛。

"Enjoy your youth, you don't really realize just how much you use your knees until they start killing you." he chuckled turning back to him.  
“好好享受你的青春吧，你不会真正意识到膝盖有多重要，直到它们开始让你痛不欲生。”他转过头来笑着对他说。

"Father Michael," he introduced himself while extending a hand "just got here a few days ago."  
"迈克尔神父，"他自我介绍着伸出手，"刚到这里几天。"

"Shinji Ikari." The boy took his hand, shaking it.  
"碇真嗣。"男孩握住他的手，摇了摇。"

"_Careful Ikari, you better watch yourself," Asuka snickered from behind him._  
"小心点，真嗣，你最好自己当心，"明日香在他身后窃笑道。"

"You don't happen to know if there's a preferred cafeteria on base?" he asked "The northside keeps serving the same old grub, it's getting old." He smiled.  
"你知不知道基地里有没有特别推荐的食堂？" 他问道，"北边的食堂老是那几样菜，我都吃腻了。" 他笑了笑。

"Try the east end, it's been better lately." Shinji neglected to add that it was due to his own suggestions to the kitchen staff, who had been the first (and only) group to listen to him so far when he made recommendations.  
"试试东边的吧，最近改善了不少。" 真嗣没有提及这是因为他向厨房工作人员提出了建议，他们是第一个（也是唯一一个）在他提出建议时听取他意见的团队。

"I'll have to look into it."  
"我得去看看。"

Both of them sat there for a moment, the man seeming to check the pew's broken kneeler, surely making a mental note to fix it whenever he got a chance.  
两人坐在那里片刻，那男人似乎在检查长椅上破损的跪垫，肯定在心里记下有机会时要修好它。

"So Ikari, right?" “所以你是碇，对吧？”

"Yep." “嗯。”

"You know, Father Jacob mentioned you."  
"你知道吗，雅各布神父提到过你。"

"Oh, did he?" "哦，是吗？"

"Yes, said you've been here, what… 8 years?" he asked.  
""是的，他说你在这里已经待了……大概 8 年了吧？"" 他问道。

"Ten." Shinji corrected. "十。" 真嗣纠正道。

"Hmm, he said in all that time he never saw you at mass, you just came in here by yourself around midday."  
"嗯，他提到在那段时间里从未在弥撒时见过你，你总是中午独自来这里。"

"Yeah… It's quiet in here."  
"是啊……这里很安静。"

"_THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT!" Soryu shouted, trying in vain to get him to jump at her voice._  
"那简直是轻描淡写！" 惣流大喊着，试图用声音吸引他，却徒劳无功。

"Ah yes, it's a nice reprieve from the controlled chaos outside." The man laughed. "I take it you're not Catholic."  
"啊，是的，比起外面的混乱，这里真是难得的宁静。" 男人笑道，"我猜你不是天主教徒吧。"

Shinji shook his head, "No… I'm not from around here."  
真嗣摇了摇头，"不……我不是本地人。"

"Oh, I couldn't tell, your German's very good. Where are you from then?"  
"哦，我都没听出来，你的德语说得真好。那你来自哪里呢？"

"Japan." The boy really wanted to add how obvious that was given his name, but he stopped himself, taking a moment to note that he was probably just being polite.  
"日本。" 男孩真的很想补充说，考虑到他的名字，这应该是显而易见的，但他忍住了，注意到对方可能只是出于礼貌。

"Really? Well, I can't say the Church has many followers there, what made you come through our doors then?"  
"真的吗？嗯，我得说教堂在那边没什么信徒，是什么让你走进我们的门呢？"

Shinji had to stop himself from saying it was the quiet that the man was currently interrupting, but that would have been rude.  
真嗣不得不克制自己，没说出是那人的打断破坏了此刻的宁静，但那样说未免太失礼了。

"Figured not a whole lot of people would be here to worship at noon."  
"想着中午来这儿朝拜的人应该不多。"

"Yes, the middle of the day is pretty quiet in here, but I'm never lonely." He said, looking up at the vaulted ceiling, before looking back to the boy "So, no faith?"  
“是的，中午时分这里相当安静，但我从不感到孤单。”他说着，抬头望向拱形天花板，然后又看向男孩，“那么，不信神吗？”

_The sound of a snort behind him was the answer he would have loved for the man to hear.  
他身后传来一声轻蔑的哼声，这是他多么希望那人能听到的回答。_

Unless you counted the 'gods' he had come to know, or the idea that he himself had the fate of humanity in his hand for one fleeting and disastrous moment… no, there was nothing.  
除非你把他所认识的那些“神”算在内，或者认为他自己曾短暂而灾难性地掌握着人类的命运……不，什么都没有。

And if there was, in his eyes, it wasn't worth worshiping.  
而在他眼中，即便存在，也不值得崇拜。

"No." "不。"

"Not even confession?" the man asked, "The last base I was stationed, plenty of men came to me regardless of their religion, though it wasn't quite as calm there, not everywhere takes kindly to peacekeeping missions."  
"连坦白都不行吗？" 那人问道，"我上次驻扎的地方，不少士兵不管他们的宗教信仰如何，都会来找我，虽然那里不那么平静，不是所有地方都欢迎维和任务的。"

Shinji eyed him "I don't think your rituals apply to me."  
真嗣打量着他，"我觉得你的仪式对我没用。"

The man smiled, taking off his glasses and pulling out a cloth to wipe them "Well I don't see why it couldn't, even if you don't believe there's nothing wrong with getting something off your chest."  
那人笑了笑，摘下眼镜，拿出一块布擦拭起来，"嗯，我不明白为什么不行，即使你不信教，倾诉心事也没什么不好。"

He shifted in his seat, eliciting an echoing squeaking ringing throughout the hall.  
他挪了挪座位，顿时整个大厅回荡起吱吱作响的声音。

"Father Jacob told me he asked you that once, said that out of everyone in his flock, you were the only one he felt regret about not giving that sacrament to."  
雅各布神父告诉我，他曾向你提出过，说在他的羊群中，你是唯一一个他感到后悔没有给予圣礼的人。

"I'm not in your 'flock'."  
“我不在你的‘羊群’里。”

Shinji received another warm smile, "And yet here you sit, anyone who might find themselves in the house of God is inherently someone I'll try to help."  
真嗣又收到了一个温暖的微笑，“然而你坐在这里，任何踏入上帝之家的人本质上都是我愿意帮助的对象。”

Pushing himself out of his seat the priest grumbled as he straightened himself, "For what it's worth, the offer stands… in case you have a change of heart."  
牧师一边嘟囔着，一边从座位上站起来，挺直身子，“不管怎样，这个提议依然有效……万一你改变了主意。”

"I appreciate the offer, but… I think it'd take too much time."  
“我很感激这个提议，但是……我觉得会花费太多时间。”

"I'm sure we'd find the time." The priest remarked with one last warm smile, "you seem like someone with regret on his mind."  
"我相信我们总能找到时间的。" 神父带着最后一抹温暖的微笑说道，"你看起来像是心中有悔恨的人。"

The clergyman gave him a slight bow, "Peace be with you.".  
牧师微微鞠了一躬，"愿平安与你同在。"

"_I'm pretty sure_ that _was the best humor we've heard in a while, idiot."_  
"我敢肯定那是我们最近听到的最好的幽默了，傻瓜。"

"Why do you pilot the EVA?"  
"你为什么要驾驶 EVA？"

He was drifting, in his mind and in what he assumed was his body, how long had he been here now? He hadn't died yet, or at least not been brought back yet. Perhaps this was for the best, here there was nothing more than his ghosts to torment him. Though _she_ wasn't here, which was intriguing.  
他在意识和身体中漂泊，不知已在此多久。他尚未死去，或至少还未被复活。或许这样最好，这里除了他的幽灵，别无他物来折磨他。尽管她不在此处，这倒颇令人好奇。

Perhaps it was better for him to drift away, a painless eternal existence where he couldn't hurt anyone else.  
或许让他就这样漂流离去更好，一种无痛的永恒存在，在那里他无法再伤害任何人。

"Why do you pilot the EVA?"  
"你为什么要驾驶 EVA？"

That was… Misato's voice.  
那是……美里小姐的声音。

Clear as day, what would she think of him? The first person apart from his mother who actually showed him some sort of affection, the first person who he could truly call his friend. She did a terrible job at helping him, but who could blame her? He wasn't even really her kid.  
清晰如白昼，她会怎么想他呢？除了母亲之外，第一个真正对他表现出某种关爱的人，第一个他可以真正称之为朋友的人。她在帮助他方面做得一团糟，但谁又能怪她呢？他甚至不算是她的孩子。

Even if she was as broken as him. Even if their relationship had been surface level at best. The woman had tried, while masking her own failings from him, she did a good job of it too, it wasn't like she physically ran from things, instead, she just drank her sorrows away.  
即使她和自己一样支离破碎。即使他们的关系最多也只是表面上的。这位女士已经尽力了，尽管她在他面前掩饰了自己的失败，她做得很好，她并没有逃避现实，只是借酒消愁罢了。

That could have been him, returning every night to drink his mind into a stupor.  
那本可能是他，每晚归来，借酒沉醉，麻木心智。

The last things she said to him…  
她对他说的最后一句话……

What were those words again? Why didn't he remember?  
那些话是什么来着？他怎么就记不起来了呢？

This last Misato however…  
然而，这最后一个 Misato……

He would be lying if he said he hadn't loved the feeling of her arms embracing him, the knowledge that she made him promise to come back, or the feeling she had given him with every drunken sob she had she'd while whispering apologies before she went off to bed.  
如果他说自己没有爱上她拥抱他的感觉，没有铭记她让他承诺回来的誓言，或者没有感受到她每次醉酒后低声道歉时传递给他的情感，那他就是在撒谎。

Was that was he should have felt from a mother?  
那是一个母亲应有的感觉吗？

"Why do you pilot the Eva?"  
“你为什么要驾驶 Eva？”

Toji… “真治…”

He failed him because he didn't act, he didn't fight Unit-03. Even if he had fought to some degree, he could have saved his arm and leg or at least he might have.  
他辜负了他，因为他没有采取行动，没有与三号机战斗。即便他有所抵抗，本可以保住自己的手脚，至少或许还有一线希望。

Why didn't he fight for his friend? Why couldn't he have tried to save him instead of being petrified? He remembered he didn't even know, he couldn't have known.  
他为何没有为朋友而战？为何不能试着救他，而非要僵立不动？他记得自己甚至不知道，他不可能知道。

But would he have fought if it was just anyone? He wasn't a soldier, he didn't have training, what was he supposed to do?  
但如果换成任何其他人，他会战斗吗？他不是士兵，没有受过训练，他又能做什么呢？

"Why do you pilot the EVA?"  
"你为什么要驾驶 EVA？"

Kensuke… 健介……

Toji and him had accepted him despite everything, the three of them had formed their own little group that he could take solus in. The two of them had become his only friends outside of NERV, the only two who had all but dragged him into a friendship.  
尽管经历了种种，冬二和他还是接纳了他，三人组成了自己的小团体，让他得以独处。他们两人成了他在 NERV 之外仅有的朋友，是唯一两个几乎将他拖入友谊的人。

Even now he could recall the two of them sitting around a campfire, the smell of smoke and heat from the flame were imprinted on his memory. The military nerd pretending to be a guerrilla fighter and him just wanting to run again. He remembered the feeling of hearing the boy tell him he didn't have a mother either and for the first time feeling like he wasn't the only one.  
即便现在，他仍能回忆起他们围坐在篝火旁，烟雾和火焰的热度深深印在他的记忆中。那个军事迷假装自己是游击战士，而他只想再次逃离。他记得那个男孩告诉他，自己也没有母亲，那一刻他第一次感到自己并不孤单。

"Why do you pilot the EVA?"  
"你为什么要驾驶 EVA？"

Rei… Yui? 绫波… 唯？

It was hard to tell sometimes, having seen his mother's face, it was amazing no one had caught onto Gendo's plan. Their voice was nearly the same, Rei's being slightly off due to age, but the face was there, if only younger.  
有时很难说清楚，见过他母亲的面容后，令人惊讶的是没有人识破碇司令的计划。他们的声音几乎一模一样，绫波的声音因年龄稍有不同，但那张脸确实存在，尽管更年轻。

His mother had used him just like Gendo, she had hadn't helped him save Asuka. At least Rei had rejected his father and instead left the decision up to him.  
他的母亲像碇司令一样利用了他，她并没有帮助他拯救明日香。至少绫波拒绝了父亲，把决定权留给了他。

A part of him wished that she had just left it all in Gendo's hands.  
他内心的一部分希望她当时就把一切都交给碇司令处理。

"Why do you pilot the EVA?"  
"你为什么要驾驶 EVA？"

Gendo Ikari 碇源堂

There was nothing really, only the lasting hatred that had stayed with him for so long.  
实际上什么也没有，只有那长久以来伴随着他的深仇大恨。

Nothing made his blood boiled like the idea of his so-called father. He would never stop hating him, Shinji would make sure to torment the man's soul if he was ever given the chance.  
没有什么比想到他所谓的父亲更让他怒火中烧的了。他永远不会停止恨他，如果有一天有机会，真嗣一定会让那个男人的灵魂受尽折磨。

"Why do you pilot the EVA?"  
"你为什么要驾驶 EVA？"

Kaji… 加持...

Shinji had been the man; he had let the love of his life slip through his fingers to spare her pain. Now he learned his lesson, he made sure to never be in the same shoes again.  
真嗣曾是那个男人；他为了减轻她的痛苦，让心爱的人从指间溜走。如今他吸取了教训，确保自己再也不会重蹈覆辙。

But things could have been different, so very different.  
但一切本可能截然不同，如此迥异。

"Why do you pilot the EVA?"  
"你为什么要驾驶 EVA？"

Her. 她。

It was always her. 一直都是她。

Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷

His life, his world. 他的生活，他的世界。

He felt a phantom pain in his chest if it was even physically there.  
他感到胸口一阵虚幻的疼痛，仿佛那里真的存在实体一般。

The one person who seemed to always be the same, perhaps it was a gift, that Asuka would always be there for him to love, the one constant. Asuka would always be Asuka, no matter how long he did this and he would always be who he is, he never changed.  
有一个人似乎总是保持不变，或许这是一种恩赐，明日香会永远在那里让他去爱，是唯一不变的常数。无论他做多久，明日香永远是明日香，而他也将始终是他自己，从未改变。

He had tried to keep himself from hurting her, but there was no other way. He had to hurt her to save her, he had to save her from drowning in her loneliness. The boy had to save her over and over, and he felt a piece of his heart crack every time he failed.  
他曾试图避免伤害她，但别无他法。为了救她，他不得不伤害她，他必须将她从孤独的深渊中拯救出来。这个男孩不得不一次又一次地救她，每次失败都让他感到心碎了一块。

Despite her beauty, her intelligence, her strength, and skill, it was like she was brittle, she was standing on the edge of a cliff with one foot hanging over the side. Asuka didn't want to save herself, she just wanted to see if anyone would care enough to save her.  
尽管她美丽、聪慧、坚强且技艺高超，却仿佛脆弱易碎，一只脚踏在悬崖边缘，悬于生死一线。明日香并不想自救，她只想看看是否有人会足够在乎她，愿意伸出援手。

And he was the only one who could do it.  
而他是唯一能做到这一点的人。

Even if it meant tumbling off the side with her.  
即便这意味着要与她一同坠落深渊。

Even if it meant feeling more pain than the last time.  
即使这意味着比上次更深的痛楚。

"_Why do you pilot the EVA?"_  
"你为什么要驾驶 EVA？"

Was that her voice or his?  
那是她的声音还是他的？

"_**Why do you pilot the EVA?"**_  
"你为什么要驾驶 EVA？"

It was both of theirs in sync.  
那是他们俩同步的声音。

"_**Why do you pilot the EVA?"**_  
"你为什么要驾驶 EVA？"

"I pilot the EVA…." “我驾驶 EVA……”

He breathed, or thought, he wasn't sure.  
他呼吸着，或者说他认为自己在呼吸，他不确定。

"I pilot the EVA… to remember that the world ended…"  
“我驾驶 EVA……是为了记住世界已经终结……”

No, that wasn't it. 不，并非如此。

"I pilot the EVA… to remember that the world ended… and it was my fault."  
"我驾驶 EVA…是为了记住世界已经终结…而这都是我的错。"

### Chapter 39: "…And I will try to fix you…"  
Chapter 39: "…我会尽力修复你…"

The rhythmic beating of helicopter blades was the first thing that the boy registered after coming back to his senses. Having watched the magnificent blue horizon for what felt like hours, Shinji was startled by the gawking of Kensuke as he gushed over the fleet they were rapidly approaching.  
直升机叶片有节奏的拍打声是男孩恢复意识后首先感知到的东西。在凝视了那片壮丽的蓝色地平线许久之后，真嗣被健司的惊叹声吓了一跳，他正激动地谈论着他们迅速接近的舰队。

"That's the UNs full-fledged fleet carrier, _Over The Rainbow_!"  
那是联合国全面部署的舰队航母，‘彩虹之上’！

Over The Rainbow… 彩虹之上……

The thought of finally seeing her again stoked the feelings of both excitement and dread within him. His stomach was churning just imagining her standing there. Seeing her in that yellow sundress again, watching that red hair blowing in the wind… it'd been so long since he'd seen her.  
终于能再次见到她的念头，在他心中激起了既兴奋又恐惧的复杂情感。光是想象她站在那里的样子，他的胃就紧张得翻腾。再次看到她穿着那条黄色太阳裙，看着那头红发在风中飘扬……他已经很久没见过她了。

Unless he counted the nightmares.  
除非他把噩梦也算在内。

Landing on the carrier deck, Shinji stretched his muscles and looking around for a glimpse of red hair, he wanted… needed to see her now that he was here.  
降落在航母甲板上，真嗣舒展了一下肌肉，环顾四周寻找那一抹红发，他现在想……需要见到她，既然已经来到了这里。

Like before, Toji's hat went flying, but Shinji's eyes weren't following this time until he heard the voice.  
和之前一样，东治的帽子飞了出去，但这次真嗣的目光没有随之移动，直到他听到了那个声音。

"Hello Misato, how're you doing?"  
“你好，美里，最近怎么样？”

Shinji turned, desperately trying to hide the smile on his face until his eyes met her figure. Then it all came back.  
真嗣转过身，拼命想掩饰脸上的笑容，直到他的目光与她的身影相遇。那一刻，一切回忆涌上心头。

_The clumps of flesh fell from the carcass of Unit-02 being carried by the Mass Production EVAs. Shinji's eyes fell on the head of Unit-02, its four eyes clearly exposed while being surrounded by entrails and mounds of gore.  
肉块从被量产型 EVA 搬运的二号机残骸上掉落。真嗣的目光落在二号机的头部，四只眼睛清晰可见，周围环绕着内脏和血肉堆。_

_Instead of Asuka standing there, it was a corpse, the maggots crawling from the eye sockets, the shriveled and decayed skin hung off its face like leather strips.  
站在那里的不是明日香，而是一具尸体，蛆虫从眼窝中爬出，枯萎腐烂的皮肤像皮带一样挂在脸上。_

His stomach began to churn, and he halved over, his stomach contents spewing out over the flight deck.  
他的胃开始翻腾，他弯下腰，胃里的东西喷涌而出，洒满了飞行甲板。

"What's his problem?" he heard the girl ask as another wave of nausea took him.  
“他怎么了？”他听到女孩问道，紧接着又一阵恶心感袭来。

"Probably seasickness," the voice of Misato answered "Shinji, you gonna be alright?"  
“大概是晕船吧，”美里声音回答道，“真嗣，你还好吗？”

ʡʘʘ….ʢ

The rhythmic beating of helicopter blades was the first thing that the boy registered after coming back to his senses. Having watched the peaceful blue horizon for what felt like hours, Shinji was suddenly annoyed by the gawking of Kensuke as he gushed over the fleet they were rapidly approaching.  
直升机叶片有节奏的拍打声是男孩恢复意识后首先感知到的事物。在凝视了平静的蓝色地平线数小时后，真嗣突然对健介盯着他们快速接近的舰队大惊小怪的样子感到恼火。

Over The Rainbow… 彩虹之上……

Just seeing her whole again… the sight of her, unmarred, pristine, and unbroken was something he needed. Butterflies filled his stomach knowing that he would see her in that yellow sundress again, watching that red hair blowing in the wind…  
再次看到她完好无损……她那未受损伤、纯净无瑕、完整无缺的身影，是他所渴望的。想到又能看到她穿着那条黄色太阳裙，红色长发随风飘扬的样子，他的胃里便充满了蝴蝶般的悸动……

Touching down and then stepping out of the flight deck, Shinji relaxed and breathed in the fresh air.  
着陆后，真嗣走出飞行甲板，放松下来，深吸了一口新鲜空气。

"Toji, hold onto your hat." He said plainly, the jock just looked at his clueless while a gust of wind proceeded to rip the baseball cap off his head.  
“Toji，抓紧你的帽子。”他平淡地说道，这位运动员只是茫然地看着他，紧接着一阵风就把他的棒球帽给吹飞了。

Running after it just like before, the same red-clad foot landed on it.  
他像之前一样追着帽子跑，同样穿着红色制服的脚踩在了帽子上。

Shinji knew better than to watch what would happen next, so he found a rather interesting fighter jet to examine while the sounds of slaps and indignation resounded nearby.  
Shinji 知道最好不要看接下来会发生什么，于是他找了一架相当有趣的战斗机来研究，同时附近传来了拍打声和不满的抗议声。

"So, who's the Third Children I've heard about, it's not going to be you."  
“那么，传闻中的第三子是谁，总不会是你吧。”

Turning around his eyes locked onto her crystal blue irises as he walked towards her.  
他转过身，目光锁定在她清澈的蓝色眼眸上，向她走去。

"That'd be me," he said, offering his hand "I'm Shinji Ikari."  
“那就是我，”他说着伸出手，“我是碇真嗣。”

Asuka leaned in, her eyes narrowing, judging every inch of his face. He wondered what she was really looking for. An ounce of insincerity? Was she looking for the same kind of mask she wore herself?  
明日香凑近了些，双眼微眯，审视着他脸上的每一寸。他不知道她在寻找什么。一丝不真诚？还是在寻找她自己脸上也戴着的同样面具？

"Hmmm," she pulled back and instead extended her hand as well, grabbing hold of the boy's while increasingly applying pressure.  
“嗯哼，”她后退一步，转而伸出手，紧紧握住男孩的手，逐渐加大力度。

He just smiled warmly at her, the small game they were sharing perfectly obvious to him as he too increased his grip in response. Of course, he was much better at this game.  
他只是温暖地对她微笑，他们之间的小游戏对他来说再明显不过，他也同样加大了握力作为回应。当然，他在这场游戏中要熟练得多。

Shinji really should have been watching her subtle movements and predicted exactly what was going to happen. Instead, he found his legs being swept from under him and his back landing on the flight deck with the sight of Asuka in her sundress standing over him.  
真嗣本该留意她细微的动作，预见到即将发生的事情。然而，他只感到自己的双腿被扫开，背部重重地摔在飞行甲板上，眼前是穿着太阳裙的明日香站在他上方。

"So much for the great Third Children." The girl scoffed as she left him there, rubbing away the sourness in his back. Though nothing could wipe the smile from his face, it felt so good to see her again.  
“所谓的第三适格者也不过如此。”女孩嗤之以鼻，留下他独自在那里揉着酸痛的背部。尽管没有什么能抹去他脸上的笑容，但再次见到她，感觉真是太好了。

ʡʘʘ….ʢ

The rhythmic beating of helicopter blades was the first thing that the boy registered after coming back to his senses. Having watched the unchanging blue horizon for what felt like hours, Shinji was unfazed by the gawking of Kensuke as he gushed over the fleet they were rapidly approaching.  
直升机叶片有节奏的拍打声是男孩恢复意识后首先感知到的事物。在凝视了仿佛数小时不变的蓝色地平线后，真嗣对剑介盯着他们迅速接近的舰队大惊小怪的样子无动于衷。

"_Well, ready to see me again?" The specter sitting next to him asked, stretching in her seat, obviously bored._  
“那么，准备好再次见到我了吗？”坐在他旁边的幽灵问道，在座位上伸展身体，显然感到无聊。

Touching down and then stepping out of the flight deck, Shinji took a deep breath and tried to relax.  
着陆后走出飞行甲板，真嗣深吸一口气，试图放松下来。

"Toji," “Toji，”

"What?" the jock turned to him as a gust of air began to send his hat flying.  
“干嘛？”体育生转过身来，一阵风开始把他的帽子吹飞。

Stretching out his hand, Shinji caught it and simply handed it back to the other boy.  
伸出手，真嗣接住了它，简单地将其递还给了另一个男孩。

"Uh, thanks." “呃，谢谢。”

"Just hold onto it alright?" The Third Children said while scanning the flight deck.  
“就拿着它，好吗？”第三适格者边说边扫视着飞行甲板。

"_Oh c'mon, you know exactly where she'll be, don't pretend!"_  
"哦，得了吧，你明明知道她在哪儿，别装不知道！"

Shinji started his walk, making sure to be curious about the planes as to not be slapped.  
真嗣开始散步，确保对飞机表现出好奇，以免被扇耳光。

"Asuka Langely Soryu." "惣流·明日香·兰格雷。"

The sounds of shouting were another indication that everything had started.  
呼喊声此起彼伏，预示着一切已经拉开序幕。

He reached Toji just as the boy was reaching for his buckle and gave him a slight nudge with his elbow.  
他恰好在东治伸手去解安全带时赶到，用肘轻轻推了他一下。

"Toji," he said calmly, to which the boy just looked back at him, "really?"  
“东治，”他平静地说道，男孩回头看着他，“真的吗？”

Realizing he was being called out, the jock reluctantly cut his display short and sighed in defeat.  
意识到自己被点名了，这位运动员不情愿地中断了他的表演，叹息着认输。

"So, who's the Third Children I've heard about, it's not going to be you." Asuka said, pointing at the jock.  
“那么，我听说过的那个第三适格者是谁，总不会是你吧。”明日香指着那位运动员说道。

Shinji stepped forward, extending his hand and giving her a small smile "Shinji Ikari," he greeted.  
真嗣走上前，伸出手，给了她一个浅浅的微笑，“碇真嗣，”他自我介绍道。

They shook each other's hands, with the girl narrowing her eyes. Like always she was trying to decipher him, but by now he was used to it.  
他们互相握手，女孩眯起了眼睛。一如既往，她试图解读他，但如今他已习以为常。

"_Oh, just admit you'd like nothing more than a nice gust of wind right now pervert!" Soryu barked from behind the group._  
“哦，干脆承认你现在最想要的就是一阵好风吧，变态！”草薙从人群后嚷道。

The swipe at his legs was easy to see by now, so he countered, sending the Second Child to the ground, or at least she would have if not for his grip on her hand. Pulling her back up he finally let go of her and couldn't help but laugh at the face she was giving him.  
此刻，他轻易地察觉到了对方腿部的一击，于是迅速反击，将二号少女击倒在地，若非他紧握着她的手，她早已摔倒。他将她拉回站稳，终于松开了手，忍不住笑出声来，因为她正对他怒目而视。

"Is that how you say 'hello' in Germany?"  
“在德国，你们是这样打招呼的吗？”

The girl scowled and turned, storming away from their group and for a moment Shinji could feel a warmth in his chest.  
女孩皱起眉头，转身离开他们的队伍，有那么一瞬，真嗣感到胸口涌起一股暖意。

ʡʘʘ….ʢ

"Proud." "自豪。"

"Arrogant" "傲慢"

"Cocky" "自大"

"Weirdo." "怪人。"

"Selfish." "自私鬼。"

"Showoff." "爱炫耀的。"

"Cold." "冷。"

"Two-faced." "两面派。"

"Baumkuchen." "年轮蛋糕。"

"Heartless." "无情。"

"Egocentric." "自我中心。"

"A real nasty girl." "真是个讨厌的女孩。"

"Rubs me the wrong way."  
"让我感觉不对劲。"

ʡʘʘ….ʢ

"Screw you! I hate…" Her shouting was cut short by the pressure of someone's arms wrapping around her.  
"去你的！我讨厌……" 她的喊声被某人环抱住她的手臂的压力打断了。

"I'm so sorry Asuka." "我很抱歉，明日香。"

His voice… that voice she knew to be strong and unwavering was shaky now, it was so much less than what she knew.  
他的声音……那个她所熟知坚定有力的声音，此刻却在颤抖，远不如她所了解的那般坚强。

"I should have gotten there faster. I… I wasn't good enough."  
“我本该更快赶到那里的。我……我做得不够好。”

Asuka shaking only intensified with his words, she didn't need this, she didn't need his pity!  
随着他的话，明日香的身体颤抖愈发剧烈，她不需要这个，她不需要他的怜悯！

"It's gonna be alright Asuka."  
"没事的，明日香。"

"SHUT UP!" She yelled, whipping around, half trying to pound her fists against his chest and half burring herself in his embrace as the tears finally fell.  
"闭嘴！" 她尖叫着转身，一半试图用拳头捶打他的胸膛，一半又埋进他的怀抱，泪水终于决堤而下。

"Shut up… Shut up… Shut up…" she said between every weakening hit to his chest while still shaking with tears flowing.  
"闭嘴……闭嘴……闭嘴……" 她每打一下胸膛，声音就弱一分，泪水依旧汹涌，身体颤抖不止。

"It's going to be alright." He cooed gently, while the girl began to release years of pent-up emotions. It wasn't even sobs. Once she stopped speaking Asuka was screaming into his chest as the tears fell, clawing at his arms but he barely even noticed the pain.  
“一切都会好起来的。”他温柔地低语，而女孩开始释放多年积压的情感。那甚至不是抽泣。一旦她停止说话，明日香便在他胸前尖叫，泪水滑落，抓挠着他的手臂，但他几乎感觉不到疼痛。

If that was his only punishment for not reaching her before Arael could tear into her mind so be it. He would let himself feel that pain forever if it meant she never had to go through that experience again.  
如果这是他未能及时赶到，阻止 Arael 侵入她心灵的唯一惩罚，那就这样吧。他愿意永远承受这份痛苦，只要这意味着她再也不必经历那样的遭遇。

Shinji let himself stroke the back of her head while making sure to support her weight so she didn't crash back into the ground. He didn't need to say a word, just being here was enough, just letting her have someone to hold onto while she released everything she had wanted to for years.  
真嗣让自己轻抚她的后脑，同时确保支撑住她的重量，以免她跌回地面。他无需言语，仅仅是陪伴在这里就足够了，让她在释放多年积压的一切时，有一个可以依靠的人。

Behind him he heard the shouts of NERV personnel, he was violating her 'quarantine' but he didn't care, she needed him. They wouldn't dare to remove him now, they'd just let him sit here, sure he would get a reprimand later, but it was an inconsequential price to pay for this moment. She needed him.  
身后传来 NERV 人员的呼喊声，他正违反她的“隔离”规定，但他毫不在意，她需要他。他们现在不敢赶他走，只会让他坐在这里，尽管之后肯定会受到训斥，但为这一刻付出这点代价微不足道。她需要他。

And he made a promise.  
他许下了一个承诺。

ʡʘʘ….ʢ

"Nobody cares about me." She whispered, her mind drifting just like the clouds she was watching in the sky above.  
“没人关心我。”她低语着，思绪如同她头顶天空中飘过的云朵一般飘忽不定。

"Who's the idiot now?" “现在谁是傻瓜？”

She turned her head slowly, the weakness she felt was sickening, but she didn't care. She was empty and cold… so cold.  
她缓缓转过头，那种虚弱感令人作呕，但她并不在意。她感到空虚而冰冷……如此冰冷。

"Shinji?" she asked, not knowing if the sight of the boy was a hallucination or real.  
“真嗣？”她问道，不确定眼前所见是幻觉还是真实。

The feeling of something soft falling on her should have alarmed her, but instead, she just watched Shinji tuck the blanket around her. Before, she would have killed him if he saw her like this… now she just didn't care.  
某种柔软的东西落在她身上本应让她惊慌，但相反，她只是看着真嗣将毯子裹在她周围。以前，如果他看到她这副模样，她可能会杀了他……现在她却毫不在乎。

"Why did you have to run away?" he asked, what was that tone in his voice, disappointment, sadness? He lifted her out of the bathtub, the ease with which he did it was remarkable, she really had lost quite a lot of weight.  
"你为什么要逃跑？" 他问道，那语气中是什么，失望，还是悲伤？他将她从浴缸中抱起，那轻松的程度令人惊叹，她确实瘦了不少。

"Shinji?" She asked. "真嗣？" 她问道。

"Yes." "是的。"

"Why are you here?" "你为什么在这里？"

The boy said nothing, just sitting down on the floor with her still in his arms. Making sure the blanket was secure around her. It felt nice, something a parent would do… something she hadn't felt that since…  
男孩一言不发，只是抱着她坐在了地板上，确保毯子在她身上裹得严实。这种感觉很温馨，像是父母会做的事……自从那次之后，她就再也没有感受过了……

Mother. 母亲。

"You need me, so I'm here." He said simply.  
"你需要我，所以我来了。" 他简单地说道。

"I don't need you," she mumbled, "and no one needs me."  
"我不需要你，" 她喃喃自语，"也没有人需要我。"

Slowly the frigid feeling in her bones began to fall away, the numbness left in their wake.  
渐渐地，她骨子里的冰冷感觉开始消退，留下的只是麻木。

"C'mon, tell me you believe that. Maybe I should call you Baka Asuka."  
"拜托，告诉我你相信这个。或许我该叫你笨蛋明日香。"

"Sync ratio zero… I'm worthless… congratulations, you won."  
"同步率零……我毫无价值……恭喜你，你赢了。"

"You think this was a competition?" He leaned in, "So is that it? Are you just a doll now?"  
"你以为这是比赛吗？" 他靠近了些，"就这样吗？你现在只是个玩偶吗？"

"Yes." She said quietly, "I'm nothing, I'm no one, I can't do anything."  
"是的。" 她轻声说道，"我什么都不是，我无人知晓，我什么都做不了。"

"Then why am I here?"  
"那我为什么在这里？"

Asuka didn't respond, her crystal blue eyes just bore into his dark ones. Those eyes weren't the ones she knew, they weren't the timid ones she had always seen when yelling at him… no, they had changed.  
明日香没有回应，她那清澈的蓝眼睛只是深深地凝视着他深邃的眼睛。那些眼睛不是她所熟悉的，不是她一直在大声呵斥他时所见到的胆怯眼神……不，它们变了。

"Please… let's go home Asuka." He said, lifting her up with him. Her pile of clothes was gone, probably in his arms or somewhere around here.  
"求你了…我们回家吧，明日香。" 他说着，将她抱起。她的那堆衣服不见了，可能在他怀里或这附近的某个地方。

"I'm going to take care of you," he whispered, carrying her out of the ruins they were in.  
"我会照顾你的，" 他低语着，抱着她走出了他们所在的废墟。

"You won't... leave?" she asked, she didn't have the strength to argue, but she wanted to hear him say it.  
"你不会...离开我吧？" 她问道，她已无力争辩，但她想听他亲口说出来。

"Never." “绝不。”

She felt herself relax, allowing the warmth radiating through her to ease her mind for once. She found her head collapsing into his chest, and her eyelids becoming increasingly heavy.  
她感到自己放松下来，任由那股温暖穿透全身，终于让心灵得以片刻安宁。她的头不由自主地靠在他的胸膛上，眼皮也变得越来越沉重。

"Thank you," she whispered, was that the first time she had thanked him?  
“谢谢你。”她低声说道，这是她第一次向他道谢吗？

It didn't matter, not here, instead, she just let her eyelids close and for the first time she drifted off with ease.  
在这里，这一切都无关紧要，她只是轻轻合上眼睑，第一次如此轻松地陷入了沉睡。

She opened her eyes to his voice, telling her she needed to wake up. They were in front of the door to Misato's apartment, and somehow, he was finding the strength to hold her and open the door.  
他的声音唤醒了她，告诉她该醒来了。他们站在美里公寓的门前，不知怎的，他竟有力气抱着她并打开了门。

How had he been able to get her here in the first place?  
他究竟是如何把她带到这里的？

Shinji only set her down once he got the table, still wrapped in the blanket, she reached up and kept it covering her. It wasn't like he hadn't just seen her, but for some reason, she didn't want to be seen by the boy, for some reason she wanted to hide from him.  
直到把桌子搬来，真嗣才将她放下，她依旧裹着毯子，伸手拉住毯子遮住自己。他明明刚刚才见过她，但不知为何，她就是不想被这个男孩看见，不知为何，她就是想躲着他。

Asuka watched as he whipped up some warm soup for her, it couldn't have been very fancy, but once the smells started to emanate from the stovetop, she noted how good it smelled. Even if she wasn't really hungry.  
明日香看着他为她煮了些热汤，虽然可能并不精致，但当香气开始从炉顶飘散时，她注意到那味道有多么诱人。即便她并不怎么饿。

How long had it been since she'd eaten anyways?  
不管怎样，她已经有多久没吃东西了？

Setting the bowl down in front of her, she looked up at the boy, whose face didn't betray his emotions.  
他把碗放在她面前，她抬头看向那个男孩，他的脸上没有流露出任何情绪。

"Eat." "吃吧。"

It was a command, but she just stared at it, unable to move. Pulling up a chair, Shinji picked up the spoon and dipped it into the soup, bringing it up to her mouth, and waited for her to eat.  
这是一个命令，但她只是盯着它，无法动弹。真嗣拉过一把椅子，拿起勺子浸入汤中，送到她嘴边，等待她吃下。

"Please Asuka." "请吧，明日香。"

That voice was pleading with her, so she slowly opened her mouth, swallowing the perfectly cooked soup. The warmth radiated out from within her, and she suddenly felt the hunger that had been absent for days now.  
那声音在恳求她，于是她缓缓张开嘴，咽下了煮得恰到好处的汤。温暖从体内散发出来，她突然感到那已经消失数日的饥饿感。

"Why?" she asked weakly, her voice frail as she took another sip of broth, "Why now?"  
“为什么？”她虚弱地问道，声音微弱，又啜了一口肉汤，“为什么是现在？”

Shinji frowned, unable to say anything as she grabbed the spoon away from him so her shaky hand continued to scoop food for herself.  
真嗣皱眉，无言以对，她从他手中夺过勺子，颤抖的手继续为自己舀食。

Shinji just stared at her as she ate, the color was starting to come back to her now and the shaking had started to slow.  
真嗣只是盯着她吃东西，她的脸色逐渐恢复了血色，颤抖也开始减缓。

"You didn't do anything before, so why help me now?" she asked again.  
"你以前什么都没做，现在为什么要帮我？" 她再次问道。

"Do you need a reason to help someone?"  
"帮助别人需要理由吗？"

She took another bite "Don't mess with me Shinji. I want the truth."  
她又咬了一口，"别跟我耍花招，真嗣。我要听实话。"

He closed his eyes "The truth…"  
他闭上眼睛，“真相……”

"I was scared. I was scared because you were… amazing. You were terrifyingly beautiful. When you wanted to kiss me… I didn't know what to do." He confessed.  
“我很害怕。我害怕是因为你……太出色了。你美得令人恐惧。当你想吻我时……我不知道该怎么办。”他坦白道。

"I wanted to reach out and grab you… but I didn't… I'm a failure."  
“我本想伸出手抓住你……但我没有……我真是个失败者。”

All of what he said was true… it just wasn't everything.  
他说的都是真的……只是并非全部。

Asuka said nothing, just finishing her meal swiftly. Not even Pen Pen came out to check on them, instead, they both just sat there next to each other, somehow enjoying the proximity to one another.  
明日香一言不发，只是迅速吃完她的饭。连 Pen Pen 都没有出来查看，他们俩只是并肩坐在那里，不知怎的，享受着彼此的亲近。

"It's late." He said simply, standing up and taking her bowl to the sink, "Your clothes are in your room then."  
“天晚了。”他简单地说道，站起来把她的碗拿到水槽边，“你的衣服在你房间里。”

He turned to her and let their eyes meet, he could tell she wanted to say something, so he waited, just standing there. Shinji knew that for her more than anybody, it was hard to ask for something. He would let her take as long as she liked… he had more than enough time.  
他转向她，让两人的目光交汇，他能感觉到她有话想说，于是他等待着，只是静静地站在那里。真嗣知道，对她来说，比任何人都难开口请求什么。他会让她慢慢来……他有足够的时间。

"I… don't want to be alone."  
“我……不想独自一人。”

That meek voice was so off-putting no matter how many times he heard it.  
那怯懦的声音无论听多少次都令人难以接受。

"Can you… stay… with me?"  
"你能……留下来……陪我吗？"

Walking around the table, he pulled her chair out and helped her up, allowing her to walk on her own, but balancing the girl's shaky figure while she did. She needed to get her confidence back, one step at a time, even if that meant literally.  
他绕过桌子，拉出她的椅子并扶她起身，让她自己走，同时稳住她摇晃的身体。她需要一步一步找回自信，即使这意味着字面意义上的。

He walked the girl to her bedroom, opening the door and helping her down onto her bed. Climbing in beside her, he kept the blanket around her while wrapping her in his arms. A small smile crept onto his face as he felt her shift to get comfortable, resting more and more weight onto him and pushing deeper into his chest, her shaking beginning to subside.  
他陪着女孩走到她的卧室，打开门并扶她坐到床上。他爬上床，用毯子裹住她，同时将她拥入怀中。当感觉到她挪动身体寻找舒适的位置，越来越倚靠在他身上，并将头更深地埋进他的胸膛，她的颤抖开始平息，他脸上浮现出一丝微笑。

Those blue eyes looking up at him seemed to ask that question again, she needed to hear him say it.  
那双仰望着他的蓝眼睛似乎又在问那个问题，她需要听到他说出来。

"Always." “永远。”

ʡʘʘ….ʢ

"Ashamed." "羞愧。"

"Afraid." "害怕。"

"Compensating." "弥补。"

"Perfect." "完美。"

"Selfless." "无私。"

"Desperate." "绝望。"

"Warm." "温暖。"

"Masked." "蒙面。"

"Schöne." "美丽。"

"Caring." "关怀。"

"Insecure." "不自信。"

"She's a wonderful girl."  
"她是个很棒的女孩。"

"I need her in my life."  
“我需要她在我的生活中。”

ʡʘʘ….ʢ

Asuka hummed to herself as she sat on the shore in the GeoFront.  
明日香独自坐在地底都市的海岸边，轻声哼唱着。

How had everything just gotten… better?  
一切怎么就突然变得……更好了呢？

She couldn't remember the last time she was just… happy.  
她记不清上一次只是……感到快乐是什么时候了。

Pure, uncomplicated happiness was all she felt right now.  
此刻，她感受到的只有纯粹、不掺杂质的快乐。

The redhead was waiting for Shinji to show up to their little picnic date. He had been the one to suggest it in the first place and here she was, early and waiting for him.  
红发女孩正等着真嗣来赴他们的小小野餐约会。原本就是他先提议的，而她现在早早地在这里等他。

She knew she was early, but she just couldn't sit and wait any longer in some random NERV cafeteria or worse, just waiting for the time to tick by.  
她知道自己来得早了，但她就是无法在 NERV 的某个食堂里干坐着，更别提只是干等着时间一分一秒地过去。

Besides, it was so much nicer out here.  
再说了，外面的世界美好得多。

She reclined back, putting her hands behind her head and just staring up at the massive dome of rock that towered over her. Since she had come to Tokyo-03 she had been pleasantly surprised by everything that had transpired.  
她向后靠去，双手枕在脑后，只是凝视着头顶那座巨大的岩石穹顶。自从来到东京-03，她对所发生的一切都感到惊喜不已。

And the boy she had met.  
还有那个她遇到的男孩。

At first, it had been so strange, the famous Third Children, no training, just shoved straight in an EVA with no plugsuit, yet somehow defeating an angel.  
起初，这一切都显得如此陌生，著名的第三适格者，没有经过任何训练，就被直接塞进 EVA 中，连插头服都没穿，却不知怎的击败了一个使徒。

And another 又一个

And another 又一个

Till he met her, and then THEY defeated one.  
直到他遇见了她，然后他们一起击败了一个。

Then another. 接着又是一个。

And another. 还有一个。

And so on. 如此等等。

But what had interested her the most was his way of handling her. No matter the outburst, no matter her desire to rile him up, he was always cool-headed and worse, he always knew what to say.  
但最让她感兴趣的是他对待她的方式。无论她如何爆发，无论她多么想激怒他，他总是保持冷静，更糟糕的是，他总能知道该说什么。

Or do. 或者说什么。

She had gone and laid down next to him, cowering from her dreams, like some puppy running for safety. She had slept next to him while Misato wasn't home, her dreams making her vulnerable.  
她走过去躺在他身边，像一只寻求安全的小狗一样，因噩梦而蜷缩。在美里不在家的时候，她在他身边入睡，梦境让她变得脆弱。

And the next morning, when his arm was around her, and her head was on his chest, she was too relaxed from the first peaceful sleep she could remember to be mad enough to wake him.  
到了第二天早晨，当他的手臂环绕着她，她的头靠在他的胸膛上时，她因为久违的安宁睡眠而过于放松，以至于没有足够的怒气去唤醒他。

Instead, she slipped away, unaware that he wasn't even really sleeping.  
相反，她悄悄离开，没有意识到他其实根本没有睡着。

And finally… when she asked for a kiss… he refused, or at least, he just didn't kiss her.  
最终……当她索吻时……他拒绝了，或者至少，他没有吻她。

Somehow, he knew. He knew exactly what she wanted from him. He wrapped her in his arms and comforted her with his words and warmth.  
不知为何，他明白。他清楚她想要从他那里得到什么。他将她拥入怀中，用言语和温暖安慰她。

Only after he had confided in her his own past, did it all click.  
直到他向她倾诉了自己的过去，一切才豁然开朗。

He was just like her.  
他就像她一样。

But somehow, he had moved past his mother's death, if only just barely. He was capable of reaching out to her in the first place while she had still been that scared little girl who didn't need anyone.  
但不知怎的，他总算勉强挺过了母亲的离世。起初，在她还是那个不需要任何人的害怕小女孩时，他就有能力向她伸出援手。

Or so she thought. 至少她是这么认为的。

That night, after they had both put Misato to bed, Shinji had made it a point to ask if she needed him.  
那晚，在他们都安顿好美里睡觉后，真嗣特意问她是否需要他。

If the nightmares were back.  
如果那些噩梦又回来了。

And she had admitted they were, that they had come back only a few days after she had woken up on his chest.  
而她已经承认了这一点，它们在她靠在他胸口醒来后仅几天就卷土重来。

So, he crawled into bed with her, let her take solus in his presence, and made sure she wouldn't be terrorized by those things again.  
于是，他爬上床与她同眠，让她在他身边找到慰藉，确保她不会再被那些梦魇所惊扰。

It had worked, for her at least, Shinji hadn't found and semblance of peace. Even after she forced him to talk about it, the topic was still something he kept hidden in his heart.  
至少对她来说，这方法奏效了，但真嗣却未曾找到一丝安宁。即便她强迫他谈论此事，这个话题仍是他心中深藏的秘密。

Until Arael. Until she had heard his screams and how he was calling out her name. She'd never forget how Shinji had convulsed, and ultimately lashed out at everything around him, like he was fighting an army of invisible foes.  
直到遇见 Arael。直到她听到他的尖叫，以及他呼喊着她的名字。她永远忘不了真嗣是如何抽搐，最终对周围的一切发起攻击，仿佛在与一支无形的敌军搏斗。

After everything, the girl hadn't even been able to do anything. She just stood there telling him she was glad he was alright like some idiot, too scared to cross the quarantine line. Shinji on the other hand somehow found the bravado to tell her he was alright despite the obvious.  
经历了这一切，女孩却什么也做不了。她只是站在那里，像个傻瓜一样告诉他她很高兴他没事，害怕越过隔离线。而真嗣却不知从哪儿来的勇气，尽管情况明显不妙，还是告诉她自己没事。

Once he was checked over and released, she had questioned him in Misato's apartment, demanded he told her what he saw. Without their female guardian there to quench the argument it had escalated into a shouting match, with him deflecting every prodding question she had.  
一旦他经过检查并获准出院，她就在美里公寓里质问他，逼他告诉她所见的一切。由于没有女性监护人在场平息争执，这场争论升级为激烈的争吵，他避开了她所有的追问。

Until she had said something wrong.  
直到她说错了话。

It was her own fault, that part of her that shielded her for so long lashed out again, insulting him and berating him for his stupidity. That wasn't what he took issue with though.  
这是她自己的错，那个长久以来保护她的部分再次发作，对他进行侮辱和责骂，指责他的愚蠢。但这并不是他介意的地方。

She had insulted his mother, used her memory to try and push him away and he hadn't taken well to it.  
她侮辱了他的母亲，利用她的记忆试图将他推开，而他对此并不接受。

"_THEY'RE ABOUT YOU!"_ “这都是因为你！”

Asuka remembered how quiet the apartment was after that. How not even the cicadas sang their tune and as soon as that fury had bubbled up, it was gone, pushed back down by the boy, and replaced with what she could only describe as sadness.  
明日香记得那之后公寓的寂静。连蝉鸣都消失了，那份愤怒刚一涌起，就被男孩压了回去，取而代之的是她只能形容为悲伤的情绪。

But she had come first to him, she always seemed to come first. He had pulled the dazed girl into a gentle hug and apologized.  
但她总是先他一步，似乎总是如此。他轻轻拥抱着那个茫然的女孩，道了歉。

Apologized…. 道歉……

For raising his voice… 因为提高了嗓门……

When _she_ had brought up the one thing, he trusted her with, when _she_ had thrown his trust to the wind and betrayed him just because she couldn't stand him hiding one little thing….  
当她提起那件他唯一信任她的事情，当她无视他的信任，仅仅因为他隐瞒了一点点小事就背叛了他……

He apologized… 他道歉了……

It was then that she knew he wouldn't leave. He couldn't leave. When he was apologizing that he was hurt by her words when he had nightmares about losing her. When the thought of her dying because he wasn't good enough kept him up at night.  
就在那时，她明白他不会离开。他无法离开。当他因为她的言语而受伤道歉时，当他梦见失去她而惊醒时。当想到她可能因他不够好而死去，让他夜不能寐时。

There was no longer any doubt in her mind.  
她心中再无疑虑。

The crunching of earth brought her attention back to the present. Someone was walking up behind her and a smile, a true smile from happiness rather than as a mask, formed on her face.  
脚下土地的碎裂声将她拉回现实。有人正向她走来，她的脸上绽放出笑容，那是发自内心的、真正的笑容，而非面具般的假笑。

"Took you long en…" She stopped, having turned around to see…. not Shinji.  
“你花了好久…”她停了下来，转身一看…不是真嗣。

Instead, it was a pale-skinned boy. He dressed near identical to the Third Children's, same shirt same pants, but that hair… those eyes…  
取而代之的是一个皮肤苍白的男孩。他的穿着与第三适格者几乎一模一样，同样的衬衫，同样的裤子，但那头发…那眼睛…

They weren't Shinji's. 它们不是真嗣的。

"Oh… I thought you were someone else." She said quickly.  
“哦……我以为你是别人。”她迅速说道。

"No matter," he said calmly, what was with that voice? It was like oil, so slick. "Kaworu Nagisa, now you know me."  
"没关系，"他平静地说道，那声音怎么回事？就像油一样滑腻。"渚薰，现在你认识我了。"

"Um, Asuka Langely Soryu, nice to meet you," she said, her words not quite sounding right to her ears.  
"嗯，惣流·明日香·兰格雷，很高兴见到你，"她回答道，但自己的话听起来总有些不对劲。"

"Ah, the famous Second Children…" he said, walking closer to the seated girl.  
"啊，著名的二号机驾驶员……"他说着，向坐着的女孩走近。"

The red-eyed boy leaned down, seemingly wanting to get a closer look at her. It disturbed her, the look of curiosity on his face like he was examining some unknown creature or scientific curiosity. For the first time in forever, the redhead wanted to squirm in her seat.  
红眼男孩俯下身来，似乎想更仔细地观察她。这让她感到不安，他脸上的好奇表情就像在审视某种未知的生物或科学奇观。久违以来，这位红发女孩第一次想在座位上扭动身体。

"So, you're the one that makes him happy?"  
“所以，你就是让他开心的人？”

"What?" she barked at him, it was enough to make him straighten up again.  
“什么？”她对他吼道，这足以让他再次挺直身子。

"I've always wanted to meet you," he explained, even though she still didn't understand "I want to know why it's you. What makes you so special to him?"  
"我一直想见你一面，"他解释道，尽管她仍不明白，"我想知道为什么是你。你对他来说有什么特别之处？"

Asuka was about to retort to the bizarre question, what the hell was the boy talking about? Some witty remark was about to escape her lips when a hand seemed to materialize on the pale boy's shoulder stopped her. Leaning forwards, the site of Shinji standing there, basket in his other hand, met her gaze.  
明日香正要对这个奇怪的问题反唇相讥，这小子到底在说什么鬼话？一句机智的回应几乎要脱口而出，这时一只手似乎凭空出现在苍白少年的肩上，阻止了她。她向前倾身，看到真嗣站在那里，手里还提着篮子，目光与她相遇。

"Ah, I was wondering when we'd meet again, Shinji."  
"啊，我就在想我们什么时候会再见面，真嗣。"

Asuka noted the strange way the boy had said Shinji's name, how he said it with... familiarity? Shinji said nothing at first, just glaring at the boy.  
明日香注意到那个男孩称呼真嗣的方式很奇怪，他带着一种...熟悉感？真嗣起初什么也没说，只是瞪着那个男孩。

"Leave." “离开。”

Kaworu nodded, plucking Shinji's hand off his shoulder, he turned away from the two of them and began to walk.  
渚薰点点头，轻轻拨开真嗣搭在他肩上的手，转身离开他们，开始向前走去。

"I'll see you around, old friend." He said simply, walking across the shoreline.  
"后会有期，老朋友。" 他简单地说道，沿着海岸线走去。

Asuka looked back and forth between the two boys, she'd never seen that face on Shinji outside of combat. The face that seemed to harden when he was engaged with an Angel, the one she had noticed when he fought Zeruel.  
明日香来回看着两个男孩，她从未在战斗之外见过真嗣露出那样的表情。那种在面对使徒时似乎会变得坚硬的表情，那种她在真嗣与零尔战斗时注意到的表情。

"Who was that?" "那人是谁？"

**Ah so the red eyed boy rears his head, bet you didn't see that one coming.  
啊，红眼男孩终于露面了，你肯定没料到这一出吧。**

**SHOUTOUTS! 特别鸣谢！**

**EvaPilotFair – Thanks! Onto 3.0!  
EvaPilotFair – 谢谢！接下来是 3.0！**

**SheriffJohnStone – Thanks! That's kinda what I wanted to do, sometimes it hard to put in stories from previous lives in chapters and make it feel right.  
SheriffJohnStone – 谢谢！这正是我想做的，有时候把前世的故事融入章节并使其恰到好处确实很难。**

**NoseGum – Thanks! NoseGum – 感谢！**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – Yep, this is the first one, that's why Asuka is so startling here. Thanks!  
Da USA 的 UltraSpink – 是的，这是第一部，所以明日香在这里才如此惊人。感谢！**

**tomdj1701 – Thanks! It's already next time haha!  
tomdj1701 – 感谢！已经是下一次了，哈哈！**

**dyinglittelstar – Fasten your seat belts!  
dyinglittelstar – 系好安全带！**

**skyf0x – Thanks! I think the interlude is a great place for us to see what kind of lives Shinji has had, taking a trip down memory lane if you will. If you've noticed so far, and hopefully in this chapter, that Ghost Soryu hasn't been in all his memories. Take that as you will, but this next part is when we get our answers!  
skyf0x – 谢谢！我认为这段插曲是让我们了解真嗣过去生活的好机会，可以说是一次回忆之旅。到目前为止，如果你注意到了，希望在这篇《一千零一夜》中，幽灵 Soryu 并没有出现在他所有的记忆中。你可以自行解读，但接下来的部分我们将得到答案！**

**Lupeskillz – Thanks! Lupeskillz – 谢谢！**

**Guest – Too many times…  
Guest – 太多次了…**

**calborghete – Thanks! calborghete – 谢谢！**

**YodaMorpheus7 – Haha! I can only imagine what kind of argument would happen between Yui and Ghost Soryu if that were to happen.  
YodaMorpheus7 – 哈哈！我只能想象如果真有这种事发生，Yui 和 Ghost Soryu 之间会爆发怎样的争论。**

**JIM D. ZAS – Thanks!  
JIM D. ZAS – 谢谢！**

### Chapter 40: "…You'll never know how many dreams; I've dreamed about you…"  
Chapter 40: "…你永远不会知道，我有多少个梦里梦见了你…"

Asuka laid there, unable to sleep, that small screen of her game the only light from inside her room while the rest was just barely visible by the light coming through her window.  
明日香躺在那里，无法入睡，游戏机的小屏幕是她房间里唯一的光源，而其余部分仅能勉强透过窗户的光线隐约可见。

A part of her had hoped that she would escape those memories after she left Germany, the change in scenery finally freeing her of the cold at night, but it had been weeks now.  
她曾希望离开德国后能摆脱那些记忆，换个环境终于能让她夜里不再感到寒冷，但如今已过去数周。

So much for that bit of hope.  
那份希望终究落空了。

Now she just laid there, unable to close her eyes, yet too tired to really do anything, not even her handheld appealed to her.  
现在她只是躺在那里，无法闭上眼睛，却又疲惫得什么也做不了，甚至连掌机也提不起她的兴趣。

She heard a door slide open or whatever the Japanese considered these thin and flimsy walls that slid.  
她听到一扇门滑开的声音，或者说是日本人认为的这种薄而脆弱的滑动墙壁。

Then… slowly… hers opened. At first, she did nothing, completely and utterly confused by the situation.  
然后……慢慢地……她的门也开了。起初，她什么也没做，完全彻底地被这情况搞糊涂了。

Turning over, she saw the Third Child just standing there, his head drooped down, slowly walking into her room, not bothering to look at her, just… slowly shuffling forward.  
她翻身一看，只见第三适格者就站在那里，头低垂着，缓缓走进她的房间，没有看她，只是……慢慢地向前挪动。

The redhead's mind drifted back to Misato warning her that the Third Child was prone to sleepwalking, and how her guardian had seemed intent about her avoiding startling or stopping him.  
红发少女的思绪飘回了美里警告她，第三适格者有梦游的习惯，以及她的监护人似乎非常坚决地要她避免惊动或阻止他。

Then again… _he_ was in _her_ room.  
不过话说回来……他现在就在她的房间里。

What's the worst he could do?  
他还能做出什么最糟糕的事呢？

He had made it very so slowly the foot of her bed, his side towards her when she gently swung her legs over the far side and tiptoed in front of him.  
他非常缓慢地走到她的床脚边，背对着她，而她则轻轻地把腿移到床的另一边，踮着脚尖从他面前走过。

She couldn't see his eyes; his hair covered the direct line of sight. His shoulders were slouched like he had resigned himself to some terrible fate.  
她看不见他的眼睛；他的头发遮挡了直接的视线。他的肩膀耷拉着，仿佛已经接受了自己悲惨的命运。

He actually looked quite pathetic compared to the typical boy she had come to know, the one that never seemed to bat an eye at her insults, and more annoyingly would never seem to leave her alone either.  
与她所熟悉的那个男孩相比，他看起来确实很可怜，那个男孩似乎从不因她的侮辱而动摇，更令人恼火的是，他也从不离开她。

Perhaps this had to do with his sync test the other day? Despite her inability to hear the back and forth between Ritsuko and the boy, afterward, she was sure something had happened, judging by Misato's face alone.  
也许这与前几天他的同步测试有关？尽管她无法听到律子和男孩之间的对话，但之后，从美里脸上的表情来看，她确信发生了什么事。

Finally, creeping closer, she leaned in, "Shinji?" she whispered.  
最终，她悄悄靠近，倾身向前，“真嗣？”她低声唤道。

Faster than she could react his arms shot up. His head was still lowered but his hands had found themselves clamped around her neck.  
他的手臂迅速抬起，快到她来不及反应。他的头依旧低垂，但双手已经紧紧掐住了她的脖子。

Her arms shot up to stop him, grabbing his wrists as his hands began to crush her neck.  
她猛地举起双臂试图阻止他，紧紧抓住他的手腕，他的手正开始掐紧她的脖子。

"Sh…Shh…" she was trying to say his name, trying to shout at him, trying to do anything.  
“嘘…嘘…”她努力想说出他的名字，试图大声呼喊他，试图做任何事情。

Her legs flailed about, desperately trying to kick him, trying to dislodge his grip, but it was useless. She reached out, clawing at him, swinging her arms, and hitting him. She even threw her leg out to hit him between his legs.  
她的双腿乱蹬，拼命想要踢开他，试图挣脱他的钳制，但一切都是徒劳。她伸出手，抓挠着他，挥舞双臂，击打他。她甚至伸出腿去踢他的两腿之间。

There was nothing. 什么都没有。

Instead, the boy just raised his head, those dark blue eyes staring into hers as her shouts were caught in her throat. Those eyes were so dead, so lifeless, this couldn't be the boy she knew.  
相反，男孩只是抬起头，那双深蓝色的眼睛直视着她，她的呼喊卡在了喉咙里。那双眼眸如此死寂，毫无生气，这绝不是她认识的那个男孩。

"P…Pleeeease… Sssshinji." She begged, trying again to pull his hands off her throat, before she felt herself begin to collapse, leading to them falling to the ground. His hands were still wrapped around her neck, but now escape felt impossible.  
“求……求求你……真嗣。”她哀求着，再次试图拉开他掐住她脖子的手，随后感到自己开始瘫软，两人一起倒在地上。他的手依旧紧箍着她的脖子，但现在逃脱似乎已成奢望。

Asuka still did her best to wrestle his grip from her neck, but it was all for nothing. The edges of her vision began to blur and the fire in her lungs tore away at her.  
明日香依旧竭尽全力试图挣脱他掐住自己脖子的手，但这一切都是徒劳。她的视野边缘开始模糊，肺中的火焰撕裂般痛苦。

Finally, she felt her hands go limp, the last of her vision turning black. The boy's face hadn't changed, but something was added to it, something glimmering in the last moments of her vision.  
最终，她感到双手无力垂下，视线尽头也转为一片漆黑。男孩的面容未曾改变，但似乎多了些什么，在她视线消逝的最后一刻，那东西闪烁着微光。

Were those tears? 那是泪水吗？

ʡʘʘʘʢ

*Ahaa* *啊哈*

A sharp pain stabbed her left side at the sudden intake of breath.  
一阵剧痛突然刺入她的左侧，伴随着急促的吸气。

She hated waking up from nightmares.  
她讨厌从噩梦中醒来。

Asuka rubbed her right eye and just laid there for a moment, doing her best to get her breathing under control. With each raising of her chest, there was a stab of pain in her side, it would go away eventually, but she could always count on it being there. Especially after a dream about him.  
明日香揉了揉右眼，就这样躺了一会儿，尽力让自己的呼吸平复下来。每一次胸口的起伏，侧腹都会传来一阵刺痛，虽然最终会消失，但她总能感觉到它的存在。尤其是在梦见他之后。

The redhead looked over at the shelf beside her bed. Reaching out, she grabbed the ancient flip phone and opened it to check the time, it wasn't like it was good for anything else these days.  
红发女孩转头看向床边的架子。她伸手抓起那部古老的翻盖手机，打开查看时间，如今它除了看时间也没什么别的用处了。

She squinted in the darkness, even with the brightness turned down the sea of reds and oranges presented still stung her eyes that had adjusted to the lack of light.  
她在黑暗中眯起眼睛，尽管已经调低了亮度，但那片红橙交织的海洋依然刺痛了她适应了黑暗的眼睛。

2:37

Asuka just stared at the screen, its background set to a photo of her on a rooftop, a sun setting behind the younger girl, silhouetting a city that no longer existed. A different life, in a very different world.  
明日香只是盯着屏幕，背景设为她在屋顶上的一张照片，夕阳在年轻女孩身后缓缓落下，映衬着一座已不复存在的城市。一个截然不同的生活，在一个完全不同的世界。

Shutting the phone with a pleasing *clap* Asuka pulled herself upright and rubbed her face. At the same time, she made sure that the eyepatch covering her left eye was still secured in place, it would do no good to have it fall off in the middle of a restless sleep.  
明日香满意地啪的一声合上手机，挺直身子揉了揉脸。同时，她确保遮住左眼的独眼眼罩依然固定在原位，要是在不安稳的睡眠中掉落可就不好了。

Standing up she went to the small mirror afforded to them and flicked on the dim overhead light that flickered to life. The mirror itself wasn't very useful either, with a massive crack going through it leading to half her face being unaligned with the rest, but it wasn't like mirrors were on the top priority for maintenance on these ancient ships. Especially when they were being prepared for automation in a few days.  
她站起身，走到为他们提供的小镜子前，轻触头顶昏暗的灯光，灯光闪烁着亮起。镜子本身也不太实用，一道巨大的裂痕贯穿其中，导致她的半边脸与另一半错位，但在这古老船只上，镜子并不是维修的首要任务。尤其是当它们几天后就要准备自动化时。

Around her neck, white cross dangled in front of her as she was bent over, the red stain prominent in the fluorescent lights. Asuka's hand reached out and grabbed hold of it, allowing the still sharp edges to dig into her skin.  
在她弯腰时，颈前的白色十字架轻轻摇晃，在荧光灯下，那抹红色污渍显得格外醒目。明日香伸出手，紧紧抓住了它，任由那依旧锋利的边缘刺入她的肌肤。

She should have thrown it away, smashed it, tossed it in the ocean… but the redhead could never bring herself to do it. She had daydreamed about it for hours on end, sitting with it in her hands, trying to work up the courage to get rid of it. But she never could, it'd be like killing a part of herself.  
她本该把它扔掉，砸碎，抛入大海……但这位红发少女始终无法下定决心。她曾无数次幻想这一刻，手握着它，试图鼓起勇气将其丢弃。然而她始终做不到，那感觉就像是在扼杀自己的一部分。

Her vision returned to the 14-year-old face in front of her, the one that harbored the faint trail of a scar on the left side, cresting her jaw and barely reaching the middle of her cheek. The face that hosted a dark circle under her one bright blue eye signifying just how exhausted she was.  
她的视线回到了眼前这位 14 岁少女的脸上，左侧面颊上隐约可见一道疤痕，沿着下颌线延伸至脸颊中部。那张脸上，一只明亮的蓝眼睛下方的黑眼圈，无声地诉说着她的疲惫。

After 6 years who wouldn't be?  
六年之后，谁能不这样呢？

A hand made its way up around her neck, rubbing at the DSS choker she had become accustomed to wearing. Her nailed dug in between the metal and her skin, giving a small click noise before her fingers started to move lower.  
一只手摸索着绕到她的脖颈，摩挲着她已习惯佩戴的 DSS 项圈。她的指甲在金属和皮肤之间划过，发出轻微的咔嗒声，随后手指开始向下滑动。

Letting her hand go down the side of her neck, she rubbed the scarred skin that ran up and down her left side like bolts of lightning zigzagging across her skin. She followed the lines up and down her arm, into the sweat-soaked tank top she wore. It seemed to spread like a vine, traveling all up and down her side, a constant reminder of what happened so long ago.  
她让手顺着脖颈一侧滑下，轻抚着那如同闪电般蜿蜒在她左侧身躯的疤痕。她沿着这些线条上下移动，直至深入被汗水浸透的背心。这些疤痕仿佛蔓延的藤蔓，遍布她的身侧，不断提醒着她那久远的往事。

Even if it felt like yesterday.  
即便感觉就像在昨天。

"Was it a dream about him again?"  
“又是关于他的梦吗？”

Asuka grumbled in annoyance to her bunkmate, it would only be for tonight, her cabin on the _Wunder_ was at least her own where she didn't have to deal with the four-eyed annoyance.  
明日香对着她的临时室友抱怨道，今晚只是暂时的，她在 Wunder 号上的舱室至少是她自己的，不必忍受那个四眼仔的烦扰。

"Yeah," she mumbled, "nothing really helps keep those away."  
"嗯，"她咕哝着，"真的没什么能赶走它们。"

She heard Mari shift back in the top bunk, the girl was probably looking down at the redhead, trying to read her.  
她听到玛丽在上铺挪了挪位置，那女孩大概正低头看着红发女孩，试图读懂她的表情。

"Wanna talk about it?" the girl asked, slipping the headphones off onto the bed. Asuka scowled at the faint sound of an audiobook being played, another annoyance. The Second Child didn't even respond to that question and just kept flipping the pendant between her fingers and looking at her reflection.  
"想谈谈吗？"女孩问道，把耳机摘下放在床上。明日香皱眉听着隐约传来的有声书声音，又是一桩烦心事。第二适格者甚至没回应那个问题，只是继续在手指间翻转着吊坠，盯着镜中的自己。

"He's gone, you know that right?" Mari asked, a hint of worry in her voice.  
“你知道他已经走了吧？”玛丽问道，声音中带着一丝担忧。

Asuka couldn't help but flex her jaw in annoyance, she didn't need a lecture right now, she had the luxury of plenty of them over the years.  
明日香忍不住恼怒地动了动下巴，她现在不需要听什么训诫，这些年来她已经听得够多了。

And she didn't need her to talk about _him_ either.  
而且她也不需要她谈论他。

"Of course." She bit back.  
“当然。”她咬牙回道。

Mari said nothing, resting her head on her hands. She just looked down on the girl, who assumed those eyes were giving her looks of pity.  
玛丽一言不发，将头靠在双手上。她只是低头看着那个女孩，女孩以为那双眼睛正流露出怜悯的目光。

"Maybe you can get some closure tomorrow, if everything goes smoothly, we'll be back after only a few orbits."  
“也许明天一切顺利的话，你就能得到些许慰藉，我们只消绕几圈就能回来了。”

"I wasn't asleep during the briefing you know." She spat back at the other pilot.  
“你以为我在简报时睡着了吗？”她对另一位飞行员反唇相讥。

"I know." The girl said softly, laying back down, "it's not like either of us get much sleep."  
"我知道。" 女孩轻声说道，重新躺下，"我们俩都睡不了多少觉。"

Asuka flicked on the faucet and washed her face at the sink. Letting the cold water refresh her, she walked back to her accommodations and laid down. The girl just stared up at the metal above her, the feelings connected to another time came flooding back despite her best efforts.  
明日香打开水龙头，在洗手池前洗脸。任由冷水使自己清醒，她走回住处躺下。女孩只是凝视着上方的金属，尽管她竭力克制，但与另一段时光相连的情感仍如潮水般涌回。

Perhaps she could get a few hours of sleep. It was a foolish thought, Mari was right, for the four-eyed girl sleep had become a distant memory, the Evangelions stripping that from her.  
也许她能睡上几个小时。这是个愚蠢的想法，真里说得对，对于四眼女孩来说，睡眠已成为遥远的记忆，福音战士夺走了她的睡眠。

Asuka herself was progressing there as well, finding that she would only get a few hours of sleep, despite how fatigued she felt at times. Dr. Akagi was monitoring her condition, assuring them each they were looking into methods of reversing the effects or at the very least slowing them down. Perhaps the worst part was the taste of food or lack thereof.  
明日香自己也正在经历这一切，她发现自己尽管有时感到极度疲惫，却只能睡上几个小时。赤木律子博士正在监测她的状况，向他们保证正在研究逆转这些影响的方法，或者至少是减缓它们。或许最糟糕的是食物的味道，或者说是缺乏味道。

Little by little… she was losing her humanity.  
一点点地……她正在失去人性。

That was alright with her, she didn't have a need for it anymore.  
这对她来说无所谓，她已经不再需要它了。

Asuka let herself settle, the creaking of the cot finally dying down as the ever so slight rocking of their ship gave her comfort.  
明日香让自己安顿下来，随着船只轻微的摇晃，床铺的吱嘎声终于渐渐平息，这让她感到一丝安慰。

For once she agreed with her fellow pilot, the boy wouldn't be inside Unit-01, but Asuka might just get some sort of closure bringing that Evangelion back home. He may have broken his promise, but she would pull whatever was left of him back home.  
这一次，她与她的同僚驾驶员意见一致，那男孩不会在初号机里，但明日香或许能通过将那台 EVA 带回家来获得某种解脱。他可能违背了承诺，但她会尽一切努力将他的残余带回家。

She needed this. 她需要这个。

"I'll see you tomorrow… Shinji" She whispered.  
"明天见……真嗣" 她低声说道。

ʡʘʘʘʢ

The Supreme Commander of WILLE sat alone in the briefing room. It was almost always an empty room on the Wunder, as it was never the center of any meaningful operations even three years after it had been taken from NERV. The Commander typically stayed aboard SSV-33 or one of the Iowa-class battleships that had been refurbished. Now was the time to move here, the to-be flagship.  
WILLE 的最高指挥官独自坐在简报室里。在从 NERV 夺取三年后，这间房间几乎总是空荡荡的，因为 Wunder 从未成为任何重要行动的中心。指挥官通常驻扎在 SSV-33 或经过翻新的爱荷华级战舰上。现在是时候转移到这艘未来的旗舰上了。

Misato leaned back in her chair, rubbing her eyes and watching the holographic globe rotate in the center of the room. The dull blue light washed over the rectangular table, while not much else was in there besides her own chair. Chairs weren't exactly high on the priority list with the final outfitting of Wunder.  
美里向后靠在椅子上，揉着眼睛，注视着房间中央旋转的 holographic 地球仪。昏暗的蓝光照在长方形的桌子上，除了她自己的椅子外，房间里几乎没有其他东西。在 Wunder 的最后装备中，椅子并不是优先考虑的事项。

The pneumatic hiss of doors opening drew her eyes to the familiar blonde as she made her way over to the Commander.  
气动门的嘶嘶声吸引了她的目光，她看到熟悉的金发女子正走向指挥官。

"We got better imagery from the NRO, it confirmed there's still a minefield around the Tesseract and its orbit didn't decay as much as we hoped." Ritsuko handed a datapad to the Commander, who looked at the imagery. "They also notified us that they'll be sending up more strike sats, a curtsy reminder."  
“我们从国家侦察局获得了更清晰的图像，确认了魔方周围仍有雷区，而且其轨道衰减没有我们希望的那么多。”律子递给指挥官一个数据板，他查看着图像。“他们还通知我们，将发射更多打击卫星，算是礼貌的提醒。”

Marked by red diamonds, she had to admit that it was rather impressive how well it had been placed, they had not simply been dispersed, instead, they had been meticulously arranged, leaving no real opening for a large craft.  
这些标记为红色菱形的雷区，她不得不承认布置得相当精妙，它们并非随意散布，而是经过精心排列，没有留下大型飞行器的明显空隙。

"We prepared for this," Misato stated simply, her voice betraying just how tired she was, handing the datapad back to her subordinate. "It changes nothing, but inform the pilots."  
“我们已经为此做好了准备。”美里简单地说道，声音中透露出她有多么疲惫，将数据板递还给下属。“这改变不了什么，但通知飞行员们。”

Ritsuko looked over the mess of papers and tablets strewn over the table in front of her old friend "You need some rest, just staring at all this won't do you any good tomorrow."  
律子扫视着老友面前桌上散乱的文件和板子，劝道：“你需要休息，光盯着这些明天对你没好处。”

"I'll be fine." The commander reassured her, "We don't get a second shot at this."  
"我会没事的。" 指挥官安慰她，"我们没有第二次机会了。"

Frowning, Ritsuko leaned over and started to clean up everything on the table "You need some sleep, you can barely keep your eyes open, I don't have any coffee to offer you." She smiled sadly; coffee grounds were an incredible commodity for all of them. All these years of no cafeen lead to long nights without their favorite drink. Rits couldn't help but look at at the greying of her commander's hair, the blonde was sure that she could spot a few on her own head.  
皱着眉头，律子俯身开始清理桌上的东西，"你需要睡一会儿，你眼睛都快睁不开了，我也没咖啡可以给你。"她苦涩地笑了笑；咖啡豆对他们所有人来说都是极其珍贵的物资。这些年没有咖啡因的日子导致他们长夜无眠，无法享受最爱的饮品。律子忍不住看向指挥官灰白的头发，她自己金色的头发中也肯定能找到几根灰白的。

The years had not been kind to either of them.  
岁月并未善待她们中的任何一个。

"The whole of HQ goes up and your coffee maker survives… and then there's nothing to make with it." Misato shook her head, as she forced herself up from the table and pulled her long coat around herself.  
"整个总部都炸飞了，你的咖啡机却幸存下来……结果却没东西可煮。" 美里摇着头，强撑着从桌边站起，将长外套裹紧自己。

"Did maintenance get the heat repaired yet?" the commander asked as she made her way into the hallway.  
“维修人员修好暖气了吗？”指挥官边走进走廊边问道。

"No, they said it would take one more day at least," Ritsuko replied, keeping pace behind her, all the materials previously sprawled out in her hands, "then again, they said that the last two days."  
"不，他们说至少还需要一天，" 律子回答道，紧跟在她身后，手中的材料原本散乱无章，"不过，前两天他们也是这么说的。"

"Hmmm," Misato stopped, knowing full well that their paths diverged at the hallway's intersection.  
"嗯……" 美里停下脚步，她很清楚在走廊的岔路口，她们的路径将分道扬镳。

"Get some sleep Misato, I am a doctor you know."  
"去睡会儿吧，美里，我可是医生，你知道的。"

Stopping next to her commander, her once friend's eyes refused to turn to her.  
她停在指挥官身旁，曾经的朋友目光却拒绝转向她。

"Ritsuko," she started, "I don't need to remind you to address me properly in front of the crew."  
“律子，”她开口道，“我不需要提醒你在船员面前对我使用正确的称呼。”

The blonde sighed at the old comment, one she had heard too many times before. Simply nodding, she took her own path to her quarter's leaving the captain behind to continue alone.  
金发女子对这句老生常谈叹了口气，她已经听过太多次了。只是点点头，她便独自走向自己的舱房，留下船长继续独自前行。

**Alright, welcome to 3.0! And you thought that sleepwalking was just some forgotten bit, didn't you?  
好了，欢迎来到 3.0！你以为梦游只是被遗忘的小插曲，对吧？**

**Shoutouts! 致谢！**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – In terms of plot we are right before 3.0, all the interludes are either taking place in the core or memories from a past life.  
美利坚超旋 – 就剧情而言，我们正处在 3.0 之前，所有插曲要么发生在核心区域，要么是前世的记忆。**

**EvaPilotFair – Knowticed the puking did you haha! Kaworu? Foreshadowing? Nah, why would you think that lol.  
EvaPilotFair – 注意到呕吐了吗哈哈！薰？伏笔？不，你怎么会这么想呢哈哈。**

**Lupeskillz – Lewd? You have no idea what kind of lewd degenerate handholding scenes I could write.  
Lupeskillz – 色情？你根本不知道我能写出多么变态的牵手场景。**

**tomdj1701 – Thanks! They will come!  
tomdj1701 – 谢谢！它们会来的！**

**JDH1080 – Thanks! I think the story has kinda lacked pointing out that Shinji hasn't only been through rough times. "It's wasn't all tears.", even if it seems to always end in them.  
JDH1080 – 谢谢！我觉得故事有点忽略了指出真嗣不仅仅经历了艰难时刻。“并非全是泪水。”即使似乎总是以泪水告终。**

**SheriffJohnStone – Thanks! Foreshadowing? Whatever do you mean?  
SheriffJohnStone – 谢谢！伏笔？你指的是什么？**

**fonte20nit – Nah, when could Karl ever know more than he should hmmm?

**calborghete – Hopefully a bit of warmth from the chapter right? I think we can see more of these kinda things in the future.  
calborghete – 希望从《一千零一夜》中能感受到一丝温暖，对吧？我想我们未来还能看到更多这类东西。**

**S02S – Ah caught that didn't you haha.  
S02S – 我抓到你了，哈哈。**

**KingXanaduu – Yeah I think there's that melancholy vibe hanging over each of those lives, seeing them kinda makes you say 'what if'?  
KingXanaduu – 是啊，我觉得每段人生都笼罩着一种忧郁的氛围，看到他们，你会不禁想问‘如果’会怎样？**

**dyinglittelstar – Kaworu's gonna be kinda fun to write, not gonna lie haha, but don't worry about me burning out, schools already working on that haha.  
dyinglittelstar – 写渚薰会挺有趣的，不骗你哈哈，不过别担心我会累垮，学校已经在帮我锻炼了哈哈。**

**skyf0x – I hope to have more bright moments in the future when looking into the past for Shinji, and I think that's important to balance out his trauma to a degree. Kaworu is going to be interesting, I think people will enjoy a bit of a different take with him, while not compromising his normal role and overall purpose.  
skyf0x – 我希望未来回顾真嗣的过往时，能有更多明亮的时刻，我认为这对一定程度上平衡他的创伤至关重要。对于渚薰，我认为人们会喜欢一个稍有不同的解读，同时不损害他常规的角色和整体目的。**

**YodaMorpheus7 – "Fuck you and I'll see you tomorrow!" -Relationship in a nutshell lol.  
YodaMorpheus7 – "去你的，明天见！" - 关系简而言之，哈哈。**

**Shredjeep777 – *Crying* "But I outlined this before I knew Re-take existed!" *Shakes fist to the sky* For real though I just read Re-take after the first interlude and yeah… I get it… but it was unintentional. Thanks for the encouragement, I'm gonna see this through till the end!  
"Shredjeep777 – *哭泣* “但我在这之前就已经构思好了，那时还不知道有《重来》这回事！” *向天空挥拳* 说真的，我刚读完第一幕间就看了《重来》，嗯……我懂了……但这真的是无意的。谢谢你们的鼓励，我会坚持写到最后的！”**

**JIM D. ZAS – Yeah, I think we might see more of their interactions….  
"JIM D. ZAS – 是啊，我觉得我们可能会看到更多他们的互动……”**

**So ironically, I can't guarantee a chapter next week. There's just quite a bit of stuff going on, I am going got try and keep with at least one chapter a week after that, but it all depends on assignments/tests and whatever else life has in store. That being said watch me just dump like 3 chapters a week for the next month instead of keeping to that.  
"讽刺的是，我无法保证下周会有《1001》。最近事情确实挺多，我会尽量在那之后每周至少更新一篇《1002》，但这一切都取决于作业、考试以及生活中其他各种安排。话虽如此，说不定我接下来一个月会每周连发三章，而不是按计划来。”**

**Until Next Time 下次再见**


### Chapter 41: "…With the pain that they gave you …"  
Chapter 41: "…他们给予你的痛苦…"

He was floating there; that vast emptiness was all-consuming.  
他就那样漂浮着；那无边的空虚吞噬了一切。

Shinji felt as if he was coming in and out of consciousness, whatever was left of his mind trying to process just what he was feeling. It was as if instrumentality had come along and swept him up, only this time he was alone, no one else was wrapped in this sea. Not even Yui was there with him.  
真嗣感觉自己仿佛在半梦半醒之间徘徊，残存的意识试图理解他所感受到的一切。就像是人类补完计划降临并席卷了他，只是这一次他孤身一人，没有其他人被卷入这片海洋。甚至连唯也不在他身边。

He was alone. 他是孤独的。

How long had he been here?  
他在这里已经多久了？

How long was he going to be here?  
他还要在这里待多久？

Even his trusty redhead companion hadn't made an appearance.  
就连他那位可靠的红发伙伴也未曾露面。

He floated in that sea of darkness, not knowing why he was still there, or where he was going, all that was left was his thoughts.  
他漂浮在那片黑暗的海洋中，不知自己为何还在那里，又将去往何方，剩下的只有他的思绪。

Even those seemed to come and go, lazily like pushed leaves by the breeze.  
即便是这些也似乎来去自如，慵懒得如同被微风推动的落叶。

When did he even get to experience an Autumn or Winter? When was the first time he got to feel the harsh winter breeze? He remembered the snow, how it trickled down from the sky, blanketing everything.  
他何时体验过秋天或冬天？他第一次感受到刺骨的冬风是什么时候？他记得那雪，如何从天空飘洒而下，覆盖了一切。

And how it had made everything so quiet, so peaceful, just like now.  
它让一切都变得如此宁静，如此平和，就像现在这样。

He'd like to see that again, if this ever stopped, his punishment for being so… blind? Useless? Did it matter anymore?  
他倒愿意再看一次，如果这一切能停止，他因何而受罚？因为太……盲目？无用？还重要吗？

The boy had to admit that if this was his final resting place if this was his fate to be left in a blissful void for eternity… it was more than acceptable.  
男孩不得不承认，如果这是他的最终归宿，如果他的命运就是永远留在这片幸福的虚无中……这已足够令人接受。

Maybe it was over, maybe he would forever be trapped in the core of Unit-01 until his mind finally failed after eons of no stimulation. He was at peace with that, no one left to hurt or fail, no one to lie to again, it would be over, and he deserved this fate.  
也许一切都结束了，也许他将永远被困在初号机的核心，直到无数年后他的意识因缺乏刺激而最终崩溃。他对此心平气和，再无人可伤害或辜负，再无谎言可编织，一切都将结束，他应得这样的命运。

Of course, fate wasn't done with him yet.  
当然，命运还未对他放手。

His peaceful drifting was suddenly interrupted by brilliant flashes of light just beyond his reach. Above the 'ice' that kept him trapped here, a mosaic of baroque light sent the barrier ablaze in a radiance of color.  
他平静的漂流突然被近在咫尺的耀眼光芒打断。在他上方，那层困住他的‘冰’之外，一幅巴洛克风格的光之马赛克使屏障燃起了五彩斑斓的光辉。

What were they? 那些是什么？

Were the flashes figments of his mind finally breaking down? People had always said they saw bright lights in near-death experiences, though he could never attest to them.  
那些闪光是他脑海最终崩溃的幻象吗？人们总说在濒死体验中会看到明亮的光，尽管他从未能证实这一点。

He didn't care. What were they going to do, kill him? He'd just be thrown somewhere else anyways. That was if he wasn't somewhere else already.  
他不在乎。他们还能怎样，杀了他吗？反正他也会被扔到别的地方去。如果他现在不在别的地方的话。

Then he heard it, something, not clear, but it was someone shouting.  
接着他听到了，某种声音，虽然不清晰，但确实是有人在呼喊。

Yelling. 大喊大叫。

Someone was barking at someone else.  
有人在冲另一个人吼叫。

Pain. 疼痛。

There was a pain in the voice, a roar in agony over something else.  
声音中带着痛楚，是对其他事物的痛苦咆哮。

It echoed here, like some sort of indiscernible gibberish it bounced off the nothingness. It was as if he was submerged and could only hear the muffled voices as he reached out against the barrier that trapped him here.  
它在这里回荡，像某种难以辨认的胡言乱语，在虚无中反弹。仿佛他沉浸其中，只能听到被阻隔的模糊声音，当他伸手试图突破困住他的屏障时。

Closer to the barrier the voice was suddenly clear.  
靠近屏障时，那声音突然变得清晰。

"C'mon do something, anything, idiot Shinji!"  
"快点做点什么，什么都行，笨蛋真嗣！"

It was her. 是她。

She needed his help. 她需要他的帮助。

Anything for her. 为了她，什么都愿意。

He reached out against that wall keeping him here, he wouldn't let it keep him from her. Not when she needed him again.  
他伸手对抗那堵困住他的墙，他不会让它阻止他去到她身边。尤其是当她再次需要他的时候。

"_Argh, this is so annoying!"_  
"啊，这真是太烦人了！"

Never again. 绝不再犯。

"_Guess you can never count on idiot Shinji!"_  
“看来你永远不能指望笨蛋真嗣！”

Never. Again! 绝不！再犯！

Shinji threw himself against that barrier, forcing whatever remained of his being forwards and clawed at it, the flashes he could distinguish only fueled his resolve. He would never abandon her. He would not fail her.  
真嗣猛地撞向那道屏障，用尽残存的力量向前挣扎，他能辨认出的闪光只增强了决心。他绝不会抛弃她。他不会让她失望。

Over and over again he pushed against that invisible wall noting that it felt weaker than he remembered, In one last strike against it, the barrier finally gave way, finally tearing apart like an AT Field.  
他一次又一次地推着那堵看不见的墙，注意到它比记忆中更弱了，最后一次全力冲击，屏障终于崩溃，像 AT 力场一样撕裂开来。

His senses exploded, as he lashed out blindly at whatever was causing her pain. Whatever dared to try and hurt her.  
他的感官瞬间爆发，盲目地向任何造成她痛苦的东西发起攻击。任何胆敢试图伤害她的存在。

Without being capable of actually seeing or processing anything, he finally felt himself begin to exhaust, his mind slipping back into a stupor that had claimed him for so long before. Was this it? Was this some new life?  
尽管无法真正看见或感知任何事物，他最终还是感到自己开始筋疲力尽，意识再次滑入那曾长时间占据他的昏沉之中。这就是了吗？这是某种新生活吗？

What did he do? 他做了什么？

Was it enough? 这足够了吗？

"Vergib mir" He breathed out.  
“原谅我。”他喘息着说。

There was nothing more for him to see or feel now, he felt nothing as his senses darkened and he returned to his blissful slumber again.  
对他来说，现在已无物可看或可感，随着感官的暗淡，他什么也感觉不到，再次回到了那极乐的沉睡中。

The situation room erupted in a cacophony of cheers as Misato Katsuragi felt herself fall back into a chair.  
指挥室里爆发出一阵欢呼声，葛城美里感到自己跌坐在椅子上。

Reaching up to take off her goggles, she fumbled with them due to the shaking of her hands. Shaking she hadn't noticed till that moment, nor had she notices just how soaked with sweat her clothes had been despite the lack of heat.  
她伸手去摘护目镜，但由于双手颤抖，动作显得笨拙。直到那一刻，她才察觉到自己的颤抖，也没有注意到尽管缺乏热度，她的衣服已被汗水浸透。

"MAGI simulations show Unit-02 Improved on trajectory to splashdown in the Bearing Sea within acceptable deviation." Someone called out from the other side of the room.  
“MAGI 模拟显示，改进后的 02 号机按预定轨迹将在可接受偏差范围内溅落于白令海。”房间另一头有人喊道。

On the holographic globe above, the red and pink trajectory arcs showed dots following along them. Nearly merged with the red one, a violet dot followed the trajectory as well.  
在上方全息地球仪上，红色和粉色的轨迹弧线显示着跟随其上的点。几乎与红色轨迹融为一体，一个紫色的点也沿着轨迹移动。

"We did it Captain, congratulations."  
"我们成功了，船长，恭喜。"

She didn't even look over at the woman, they had yet to recover any of the EVAs, let alone be sure that there would be no problems in the lower parts of the atmosphere. And if the chutes broke….  
她甚至没有看向那个女人，他们还没有找回任何 EVA，更不用说确保在低层大气中不会出现问题。如果降落伞坏了……

They had expected the N2 minefield, but there had been no indication of a Mark 4 unit being on Unit-01's coffin. There had also been no mention in any of their documents of the coffin's ability to actively change trajectory.  
他们预料到了 N2 地雷阵，但并未收到任何关于 Mark 4 单元存在于零号机棺柩中的情报。他们的文件中也未曾提及棺柩具备主动改变轨迹的能力。

Luckily they still had the Second Child.  
幸好他们还有二号机。

"There's nothing to celebrate yet." She answered coldly. "Besides, look at this."  
"现在还没什么值得庆祝的。" 她冷冷地回答，"而且，看看这个。"

Pulling up the images just sent to her, she watched the expression on the doctor's face at the somewhat blurry images. Yet there was a clear beam of energy, and she was more than certain they would have recorded a massive energy signature as well.  
她调出刚刚收到的图像，观察着医生在模糊的影像前的表情。尽管图像有些模糊，但那道明显的能量光束清晰可见，她确信他们也记录到了巨大的能量信号。

"Just like 10 years ago…"  
"就像 10 年前那样…"

_"Asuka would want you to do it, save everyone!"  
"明日香会希望你这么做的，拯救所有人！"_

"I remember…" the woman mumbled as she leaned back into her chair. A million questions flowed through her mind. Would Unit-01 'reactivate' the Near Third Impact? Was their two years' worth of work for nothing?  
"我记得…" 女人喃喃自语，向后靠在椅背上。无数疑问涌入她的脑海。初号机会'重新激活'近第三次冲击吗？他们两年的努力是否会化为泡影？

After everything they had gone through, she didn't believe they really had any other choice but to right it.  
经历了这一切之后，她不认为他们真的还有其他选择，只能纠正错误。

"What's the ETA on the recovery vessels?"  
“救援船只预计何时到达？”

"They have aircraft in the air and have all three targets on radar. They should get to them shortly after splashdown."  
“他们已经派出飞机在空中，并且雷达上已经锁定了所有三个目标。应该在溅落之后不久就能到达。”

Misato nodded and stood up, "Come get me when they've reached both pilots."  
美里点头站起身，“他们找到两位驾驶员时再来叫我。”

"Yes, Captain." “是，队长。”

Taking her to leave, Misato took a deep breath as she slipped out into the hallway.  
带着她离开，美里深吸一口气，悄悄走进了走廊。

Where had the years gone?  
岁月都去哪儿了？

It felt like yesterday that she had watched the towering figure of Unit-01 lumber past her in the Geofront. She let those memories of a previous lifetime trickle back into her mind as she made her way to her quarters.  
仿佛就在昨日，她目睹了零号机在 Geofront 中笨拙地走过她的身旁。她任由那些前世的记忆缓缓流回脑海，一边走向自己的住处。

Looking back, things seemed so easy, so simple, she didn't know what she knew now. NERV had been a force for good in her eyes, not something that hunted them and terrified the remainder of humanity.  
回首往事，一切似乎都那么简单，那么容易，她不知道自己现在所知的一切。在她眼中，NERV 曾是正义的力量，而非追捕他们、令人类余部胆战心惊的存在。

The woman rubbed her eyes and made her way through the lavish quarters and to her bed. Not bothering to change clothes yet, she laid down and let her increasingly heavy eyelids close. Perhaps a few hours of sleep would be  
女子揉了揉眼睛，穿过豪华的住所，走向自己的床。暂时没换衣服，她躺下，让越来越沉重的眼皮合上。或许几个小时的睡眠会带来些许

ʡʘʘʘʢ

As Unit-02 and its target began to hit the upper reaches of the atmosphere the Second Child still couldn't find any words.  
当二号机及其目标开始冲击大气层上层时，第二适格者仍旧找不到任何言语。

"_C'mon do something, anything, idiot Shinji!"_  
"快点做点什么，什么都行，笨蛋真嗣！"

After all these years she was still calling out to him. She hadn't meant to say that, she shouldn't have even thought that, it just came out…  
毕竟这么多年过去了，她仍在呼唤着他。她本无意说出那句话，甚至不该去想，但它就这么脱口而出……

Here she was, looking at the near blinding light before her, Unit-01 had activated, somehow, something had heard her. An impossibility that she refused to accept even after all this time, the question now was how?  
此刻的她，面对着眼前近乎刺眼的光芒，初号机竟然启动了，不知怎的，有什么听见了她的呼唤。一个她多年来拒绝接受的不可能事实，如今的问题是，这究竟是如何发生的？

A familiar pendent floated into her vision, its worn string reaching out back to her neck, reminding her of the microgravity environment she was still in. The Second Child just stared at the cross floating in the last moments before they hit the atmosphere, reminding her of the boy she could never seem to forget.  
一枚熟悉的吊坠飘入她的视线，磨损的细绳回溯至她的颈间，提醒她仍身处微重力环境。第二适格者只是凝视着那悬浮在即将进入大气层前的十字架，心中浮现那个她似乎永远无法忘却的男孩。

After all this time… 经过了这么久……

He had saved her. 他救了她。

Perhaps this was one last gift from him if there was even a shred of him left in the core. She had heard the reports of Unit-01 behaving like it had a mind of its own, but those thoughts would get her nowhere now.  
或许这是他留下的最后一丝馈赠，如果核心中还残留着他的哪怕一丝痕迹。她曾听说过初号机表现得仿佛拥有自我意识，但这些念头如今已无法为她带来任何进展。

As she finally began to hit the outer layer of the atmosphere, she braced herself as best she could inside the entry plug. It wasn't like they had harnesses built into the seats, so she locked the controls and held on tight as brilliant trails of plasma licked at the sides of her view from inside the entry plug.  
当她终于开始触及大气层的外层时，她在驾驶舱内尽可能地做好了准备。座椅上并没有安全带，于是她锁定了控制器，紧紧抓住，从驾驶舱内望去，耀眼的等离子尾迹在视野两侧划过。

The plan called for her to shield Unit-01's 'coffin' from reentry as best as she could, but simply holding onto it with one remaining arm was a challenge. The stump that had been Unit-02's left arm was still glowing, though the physical pain she was enduring was no more than her usual daily discomfort. Unless the maintenance crews worked overtime, she was sure that Unit-02's repairs would take quite some time.  
计划要求她尽可能保护初号机的‘棺材’免受再入伤害，但仅凭一只手臂紧紧抓住它本身就是个挑战。零号机左臂的残肢仍在发光，尽管她所承受的肉体痛苦并不比日常的不适更甚。除非维修人员加班加点，否则她确信零号机的修复工作将耗时良久。

Finally, after what had felt like ages, Asuka felt the first chute deploy. The girl again strengthened her grip as the rest of the parachutes deployed, causing a massive G-load to crush the redhead down into her seat.  
终于，在仿佛过了许久之后，明日香感觉到第一个降落伞展开了。她再次加强了握力，随着其余降落伞的展开，巨大的 G 力将红发少女压向座椅。

Off in the distance, she could make out the faint outlines of the retrieval fleet as they approached, marked clearly by their white wakes against the red sea. Aircraft buzzed around her as she continued to descend slowly towards the ocean.  
远处，她能隐约看到回收舰队的轮廓正逐渐接近，它们白色的尾迹在红色海洋上清晰可辨。飞机在她周围嗡嗡作响，她继续缓缓向海面降落。

Soon they'd pluck her from the ocean and she could relax for the trip north, of course assuming that she didn't immediately sink upon splashdown despite the assurances given to her. Looking back at the coffin she only now noticed the crack in the upper half. Squinting, she could just barely make out a sliver of Unit-01's face.  
很快他们就会将她从海洋中打捞上来，她可以在北上途中放松一下，当然前提是她不会在溅落时立刻沉没，尽管有人向她保证过。回头看向那棺材，她现在才注意到上半部分有一道裂缝。眯起眼睛，她勉强能辨认出零一机的一点点面容。

"Welcome back… Unit-01." “欢迎回来……零一机。”

Kaworu Nagisa let his eyes gaze up at the beautiful night sky. It was the same sky he always knew, it never changed, and he enjoyed that. He enjoyed counting every single tiny dot of light and how he could name every constellation and star.  
渚薰抬头凝视着美丽的夜空。这是他一直熟悉的天空，从未改变，他很喜欢。他喜欢数着每一颗微小的光点，以及如何能叫出每一个星座和星星的名字。

Now he watched as one was falling from the heavens, a brilliant streak of light amongst the ocean of stars. He knew exactly what it was and the pale boy's lips curled at the thought of seeing him again.  
此刻，他凝视着天际，一道璀璨的光芒划破星海。他心知肚明那是什么，苍白少年的唇角因再次见到他的念头而微微上扬。

"Welcome back… Shinji." “欢迎回来……真嗣。”

**Shoutouts! 致谢！**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – Ah, it all depends.  
美利坚的 UltraSpink – 啊，这都取决于情况。**

**S02s - *Unenthusiastic clapping from the crowd* haha, 3.0 isn't exactly well regarded.  
S02s - *人群中传来不甚热情的掌声* 哈哈，3.0 可不怎么受人待见。**

**SheriffJohnStone – We'll have to see, things might be different, they might not.  
SheriffJohnStone – 我们得看看，情况可能会有所不同，也可能不会。**

**YodaMorpheus7 – "You see, improvising is our specialty."  
YodaMorpheus7 – “你看，即兴发挥是我们的专长。”**

**NoseGum – *Loooooping meme intensifies* Yeah, the great thing about Mari before 4.0 was that she's kind of a blank slate like she still is, but even if you mess with the character it's not like it'll change the canon story much.  
NoseGum – *循环梗愈发强烈* 是啊，4.0 版本之前的玛丽之所以很棒，是因为她像现在一样是个空白画布，即便你调整角色，也不会对原故事产生太大影响。**

**Lupeskillz – ah, 6 years for her….  
Lupeskillz – 啊，对她来说已经六年了……**

**Romulo Nidoking BR – Very interesting, especially if Shinji wakes up and thinks is a whole new world.  
Romulo Nidoking BR – 非常有趣，特别是如果真嗣醒来并认为这是一个全新的世界。**

**EvaPilotFair – Make sense? Out of EVA? What are you insane? Lol, no maybe condense it down a bit, restructure is probably a good, word.  
EvaPilotFair – 说得通吗？脱离 EVA？你疯了吗？哈哈，不，也许可以稍微压缩一下，重新组织语言可能是个好主意。**

**dyinglittelstar – Man, no one thought Asuka might not have been awake the whole time… Yep, we'll get more of that cross in the future, he did give it to her to hold onto after all.  
dyinglittelstar – 天啊，没人想到明日香可能一直没醒着……没错，未来我们还会看到更多那个十字架，毕竟他确实把它给了她保管。**

**fonte20nit – Man, someone should have a character use that in a story, if Kaji was around in canon that seems like something he might call Shinji.  
fonte20nit – 应该有人让角色在故事中用上这个称呼，如果卡兹在正史中出现，他可能会这样叫真嗣。**

**tomdj1701 - *The Boys Are Back begins to play in the background*  
tomdj1701 - *《男孩们回来了》开始在背景中播放***

**calborghete – Hopefully it's enjoyable!  
calborghete – 希望你喜欢！**

**JIM D. ZAS – Thanks!  
JIM D. ZAS – 谢谢！**

**skyf0x – Last short chapter for a while, I promise haha. I wrote it so that she had much worse injuries from Bardiel hence the scars, it was interesting that she doesn't have any in 4.0 despite going through what Toji lost an arm and leg too. As for Mari stating Shinji isn't in the core, they all believe that, why? That's for the next few chapters, which will reveal some things. Mari isn't canon Mari, I'm just gonna throw that one out there, I have different plans for her character.  
skyf0x – 这是短期内最后一篇chapter了，我保证哈哈。我写这篇时设想她从巴迪尔那里受了更严重的伤，因此留下了疤痕，有趣的是她在 4.0 中并没有任何疤痕，尽管经历了与东治失去手臂和腿同样的事情。至于真希说真嗣不在核心中，他们都这么认为，为什么呢？接下来的几章会揭晓一些事情。真希不是正典中的真希，我先这么提一下，我对她的角色有不同的计划。**

**Guest – And yet, what if he's just the right person to get it back hmmm?  
Guest – 然而，如果他恰恰是能找回它的人呢？嗯？**

**GeHirNunDherZ – Thanks! Hopefully a bit more cohesively than 3.0 haha.  
GeHirNunDherZ – 感谢！希望比 3.0 更连贯一些，哈哈。**

**Alright, a bit short I know, but that's because I wanted more stuff with the next few chapters. As for actually seeing Operation US, don't worry, we'll see it, the question you're asking is how though? Prepare for a few long chapters as I've had a lot of fun writing them, hopefully, we'll get back to 2 chapters a week in the near future.  
好吧，我知道有点短，但那是因为我想在接下来的几章里加入更多内容。至于实际看到 Operation US，别担心，我们会看到的，你问的问题是怎样看到？准备好迎接几章长篇吧，我写得很开心，希望不久的将来能恢复到每周两章。**

**Until Next Time. 下次再会。**


### Chapter 42: "…I am a Poor Wayfaring Stranger…"  
Chapter 42: "…我是一个可怜的漂泊者…"

"Captain Katsuragi…" Ritsuko said, closing in on the captain on the bridge.  
"葛城舰长…" 律子说道，在舰桥上向舰长靠近。

She was staring out into the red vastness through one of the many windows of the bridge, the doctor had found her doing similar things the last few days once Unit-01 had been brought to the _Wunder_.  
她正透过舰桥上的众多窗户之一，凝视着外面红色的广袤空间，医生发现她最近几天在零号机被带到奇迹号上后，经常做类似的事情。

Now there was this. 现在有了这个。

"We've made a discovery with Unit-01."  
“我们在零号机上有了一个发现。”

"And that is?" the woman asked, not taking her gaze off the window before her.  
"那是什么？" 女人问道，目光始终未曾离开她面前的窗户。

Ritsuko eyed the handful of maintenance crews prepping the area for the ship's activation. They couldn't hide their wandering gazes every time and this wasn't something they needed to know.  
律子瞥了一眼正在为飞船启动做准备的维修团队。他们每次都忍不住四处张望，但这并不是他们需要知道的事情。

"It's better we had this conversation in a more… private area."  
"我们最好在更……私密的地方讨论这件事。"

Misato finally turned to the woman, eyeing her, and then the members of the crew working on the bridge. Nodding, the two women took their leave, making their way to a briefing room not too far away.  
美里终于转向那位女士，打量了她一番，然后又看了看在舰桥上工作的船员们。两人点头示意后，便离开了，前往不远处的一间简报室。

Shutting the door, the blonde handed the captain a report, mentally preparing herself for the emotions she was sure were about to be unleashed.  
关上门，金发女子递给舰长一份报告，心中暗自准备迎接即将爆发的情绪。

"They found it when they were stripping Unit-01 for parts." She explained, "An extra entry plug wouldn't hurt, and the LCL replenished our reserves."  
“他们在拆解 01 号机时发现了它。”她解释道，“多一个插入栓也无妨，而且 LCL 补充了我们的储备。”

Misato didn't express any emotions; her eyes were simply glued to the pictures in front of her.  
美里没有表现出任何情绪；她的目光只是紧紧锁定在面前的照片上。

What looked like a boy, in the same clothes she remembered, eyes closed and currently unconscious.  
看起来像个男孩，穿着她记忆中的同款衣服，双眼紧闭，目前处于昏迷状态。

"It's been transferred to an isolation wing, it was alive, that we can confirm, but we don't really know what to think right now."  
“它已经被转移到隔离区了，我们可以确认它还活着，但现在我们真的不知道该怎么想。”

"What does your gut tell you?" she asked, finally handing the report back to Ritsuko.  
"你的直觉怎么说？" 她终于将报告递还给律子。

Frowning, the woman really didn't want to have this problem at the moment "I say it's impossible, but… we tend to do the impossible a lot around here."  
皱着眉，这位女士此刻实在不想面对这个问题，"我认为这是不可能的，但是……我们这里经常做些看似不可能的事。"

Misato nodded, "If it does wake up and somehow isn't instantly identified as a pattern blue, treat it as an enemy combatant, but bring it directly to the bridge discreetly. We don't need this getting out to the crew, talk with the team who pulled it out, and…" she stopped, taking a breath.  
美里点头道，"如果它真的醒了，并且不知为何没有立即被识别为蓝色模式，就把它当作敌方战斗人员处理，但要悄悄地直接带到舰桥。我们不需要让船员们知道这件事，和负责打捞的小队谈谈，还有……" 她顿了顿，深吸了一口气。

"Don't inform the other pilots."  
"别告诉其他驾驶员。"

Ritsuko raised an eyebrow.  
律子挑了挑眉。

"Chances are this isn't _him_; we don't need to be stirring up emotions right now."  
"很可能不是他；我们现在不需要激起情绪波动。"

"Do you really think they were settled in the first place?" The doctor asked, silently thankful Misato hadn't taken the news as poorly as she had anticipated.  
"你真的认为他们一开始就安顿好了吗？" 医生问道，默默庆幸美里没有像她预想的那样对消息反应不佳。

The captain said nothing and just rested against the table in the center of the room.  
舰长什么也没说，只是靠在房间中央的桌子上休息。

"They weren't for any of us really." The blonde mumbled under her breath, leaving her superior and heading back to the bridge.  
"对我们任何人来说，他们其实都没有安顿好。" 金发女子低声咕哝着，离开了上级，返回舰桥。

Misato just sat there alone in the situation room, not even the globe illuminated the area.  
美里独自坐在作战室里，连地球仪的光都没能照亮这片区域。

She let her thoughts drift back to last night when they had brought Unit-01 back.  
她让自己的思绪飘回到昨晚，那时他们刚把初号机带回来。

_Standing on the island of their largest aircraft carrier, Misato just looked down at the piles of metal scrap that had once been Unit-01's sarcophagus.  
站在他们最大的航空母舰的岛式上层建筑上，美里只是俯视着那些曾经是零号机棺柩的金属废堆。_

_Sarcophagus, coffin, hell even the official documents had it listed as 'Tesseract', but no one used that term.  
石棺，棺材，甚至官方文件上都写着‘Tesseract’，但没人用这个词。_

_Sprawled out on the deck and illuminated by racks of floodlights, the humanoid figure of Unit-01 laid there. Or perhaps the remains of Unit-01 would be more specific. They would draw out all fluids and would extract the LCL before converting it for use in_ Wunder_, they could use those scarce resources._  
躺在甲板上，被一排排泛光灯照亮，Unit-01 的人形身影躺在那里。或许说 Unit-01 的遗骸更为准确。他们会抽干所有液体，提取 LCL，然后将其转换用于 Wunder，这些稀缺资源可以利用。

_On the other half of the deck, Unit-02i was curled up, doing its best at taking up as little space as possible. The mismatched colors of rusty and corroded armor made it almost a humorous sight, a half dozen patch jobs fixing battlefield damage and the thing still refused to die. If only its pilot didn't refuse to drive it so hard, it might have held up better over the years.  
甲板的另一半，Unit-02i 蜷缩着，尽可能少占空间。锈蚀和腐蚀的装甲颜色不协调，几乎显得滑稽，半打战场修补痕迹，这东西依然不肯死去。如果它的驾驶员不那么拼命驾驶，这些年或许能撑得更久些。_

_Even though the whole deck was being used they weren't exactly using_ Over the Rainbow _for launching aircraft, there was no need to transfer either of them until it had been fully prepped for_ Wunder  
尽管整个甲板都被占用，但他们并未真正使用“彩虹之上”来发射飞机，没有必要在它完全准备好迎接“奇迹”之前转移它们。_._

_Right now, there was no work being down though, nightfall was upon them, and it would soon be too cold to even be outside. The Arctic Ocean hadn't been their first choice, but it would have to do.  
眼下，并没有任何工作在进行，夜幕已经降临，很快外面就会冷得无法忍受。北极洋并非他们的首选，但只能将就了。_

_Pulling her jacket tighter, Misato braced herself as a gust of wind rushed over everything on the flight deck, nearly blocking out her hearing. But the sound of footsteps against metal grates drew her attention away from the sight under her.  
米萨托紧了紧外套，迎着一阵狂风做好准备，这风席卷了飞行甲板上的所有东西，几乎让她听不见任何声音。但金属格栅上脚步声的响起，将她的注意力从脚下的景象中拉了回来。_

"_Pilot Shikinami reporting."_  
"飞行员式守报告。"

_The sarcasm in that voice was not lost on her.  
那声音中的讽刺意味她没有错过。_

"_Your mission was successful; you'll have a debriefing at 0900 hours tomorrow. Get some rest till then."_  
"你的任务成功了；明天早上九点进行汇报。在那之前好好休息。"

"_Yeah, I'm pretty sure I can tell it was a success." The redhead mumbled while shivering at the cold biting both of them. All she had was a jacket, cap, and plug suit, and pilot's plug suits weren't exactly meant for adverse conditions._  
“是啊，我很确定我能看出它成功了。”红发女孩喃喃自语，同时因寒冷刺骨而颤抖。她只穿了一件夹克、一顶帽子和插头服，而飞行员的插头服并不适合恶劣天气。

_Misato said nothing to her subordinate and just went back to looking out over the EVA.  
美里没有对她的下属说什么，只是继续凝视着 EVA。_

"_Hard to believe we'd see it again." Asuka mumbled as she leaned against the railing, "Did Akagi figure out why the thing activated in orbit?"_  
“真难相信我们还能再见到它。”明日香靠在栏杆上喃喃道，“赤木有没有弄清楚那东西为什么会在轨道上激活？”

"_We'll discuss that at your debriefing."_  
"我们会在你的汇报会上讨论这个。"

"_Hmm,"_  "嗯，"

_The sound of the girl's footsteps was all that she needed to know that the girl had left. Idle chitchat had never been either of their strong suits, especially in the year's since she'd woken up  
女孩脚步声的消失，是她唯一需要确认的，女孩已经离开。闲聊从来不是她们的长项，尤其是在她醒来后的这些年里。_

ʡʘʘʘʢ

"There has been a development."  
"情况有了新的进展。"

The massive room that had been Gendo Ikari's office was more than accommodating the echoing of Fuyutsuki's voice  
原本是碇源堂办公室的宽敞房间，足以容纳冬月声音的回响。

"Unit-01 has been successfully retrieved from orbit." The elderly man informed the commander.  
"初号机已成功从轨道上回收。" 这位老者向指挥官报告道。

"SEELE was foolish, tossing it to the heavens, treating it as waste." The commander mused; his irritation not lost on the older man.  
“SEELE 真是愚蠢，将它抛向天空，视之为废物。”指挥官沉思道；他的不悦并未逃过那位年长者的眼睛。

"However, that is not new information, Operation US has been in planning for years. Is that it?" he growled.  
“然而，这并非新消息，‘美国行动’已策划多年。就这些吗？”他咆哮道。

"No. It appears… the Third Child was recovered from the entry plug."  
“不。看来……第三适格者是从插入栓中被救出的。”

"Alive?" "还活着？"

"Unconscious, contamination could not be determined. Our source inside WILLE has access, but even within their ranks it's been hidden from most of the crew, including the fellow pilots."  
"昏迷不醒，污染程度无法确定。我们在 WILLE 内部有线人，但即便在他们内部，这一信息也被隐藏起来，大多数船员，包括其他飞行员都不知情。"

For a moment neither said anything, Fuyutsuki was doing his best to determine what exactly was going through the younger man's mind. Though he had to admit he rarely believed he truly understood the man these days.  
一时间两人都沉默不语，冬月正竭力揣摩着这位年轻人的心思。尽管他不得不承认，近来他很少觉得自己真正了解这个人。

"It seems this will be the second time your son has been brought back from the dead."  
“看来这将是你的儿子第二次从死里复活了。”

.

"Cancel our preparation for searching the villages." Gendo sat up "The ritual can be expedited with Unit-13's completion."  
"取消对村庄的搜索准备。" 源度坐起身来，"仪式可以借助 13 号机完成来加速进行。"

"Send out Mark.09, have it bring the Third Child back, by force if necessary."  
"派出 Mark.09，让它把第三适格者带回来，必要时可采取强制手段。"

"Do you think it is wise to do so? There's no guarantee his mind is intact."  
"你认为这样做明智吗？他的心智完整性无法保证。"

"If he's damaged, so be it. The original plan will only be delayed briefly."  
"如果他受损了，那就这样吧。原计划只会短暂延迟。"

There was nothing left to say, as the older man left his colleague by himself in what was left of his 'office'.  
老者无言以对，留下同事独自一人待在他那残存的‘办公室’里。

"So, the prodigal son returns…"  
“所以，浪子回头了……”

ʡʘʘʘʢ

*Ahaaa* *啊哈*

The first intake of breath hadn't hurt so much this time, which was a welcome surprise really.  
这次第一次呼吸并没有那么痛，这真是个意外的惊喜。

Shinji Ikari opened his eyes, meeting the cold sight of a metal ceiling…  
碇真嗣睁开眼睛，映入眼帘的是一片冰冷的金属天花板……

An unfamiliar ceiling. 一个陌生的天花板。

"This one's new." He mumbled.  
"这个是新的。" 他咕哝道。

"_Oh, you're telling me!" a certain someone grumbled. Looking over, there she was, leaning against the wall, arms crossed in front of her chest and sporting the same bandages as always. The room was lit with a red hue, courtesy of some sealing pillars scattered around him._  
"哦，你是在跟我说这个！" 某个家伙抱怨道。她靠在墙上，双臂交叉在胸前，一如既往地缠着绷带。房间被红色光芒照亮，这要归功于散布在他周围的几个封印柱。

"_Do you know how boring it's been?"_  
"你知道有多无聊吗？"

Shinji tried to push himself up but stopped the moment he realized two bars of metal held him down. His body felt weird, the feeling of pins and needles ran all along with him for some reason.  
真嗣试图撑起自己，但立刻意识到两根金属条压住了他。他的身体感觉很奇怪，不知为何全身都像针扎一样。

"Hmmm" “嗯……”

"_Yeah, you're strapped down there," she said, striding over to him. She leaned down, right next to his head, a sinister smiled on her face. "You know, I could do all kinds of things to you right now, maybe even a little payback for what you did while I was helpless."_  
“是啊，你被绑在那儿了，”她一边说，一边大步走向他。她弯下腰，脸贴近他的头，脸上挂着阴险的笑容。“你知道吗，我现在可以对你做各种各样的事，也许还能为我在无助时你做的事讨回点公道。”

Shinji just closed his eyes "Sure, knock yourself out," it wasn't like she could do anything physically. He just didn't care, he just wanted to sleep.  
真嗣只是闭上了眼睛，“当然，随你便，”反正她也不能对他造成什么物理伤害。他根本不在乎，只想睡觉。

"_Oh, just lay there and feel sorry for yourself, will you?"_  
"哦，就躺在那儿自怨自艾吧，你行不行？"

He just sighed and closed his eyes, but it wasn't long before a door opened, and the sound of footsteps made their way into the room. Opening one eye, he spotted the back of a… well it wasn't a nurse he would know from NERV, and she must've been short for an adult.  
他只是叹了口气，闭上了眼睛，但不久后一扇门打开了，脚步声走进了房间。他睁开一只眼，看到了一个背影……嗯，那不是他从 NERV 认识的护士，而且她作为一个成年人来说肯定很矮。

And what was with that beret?  
还有那顶贝雷帽是怎么回事？

"Um, excuse me." “呃，打扰一下。”

In all fairness, he should have expected her to scream, her back _was_ to a presumably unconscious patient. What he could have never expected was for armed guards to rush in, guns drawn. He rolled his eyes at the theatrics and just shut them again, this wasn't turning out to be a very good reception for a new life.  
平心而论，他本该预料到她会尖叫，毕竟她的背后是一个可能昏迷的病人。但他万万没想到会有武装警卫冲进来，枪口对准。他对这种戏剧性的场面翻了个白眼，然后又闭上了，对于一个新生命来说，这可不是个很好的欢迎仪式。

Swiftly he was being carted along, with the wheels of his gurney being quite annoying as one of them was rather sticky, causing whoever was pushing him to crash more than once. Soon enough, however, he was in some sort of lift, though it was rather hard to tell due to his limited vision.  
他很快就被推着走，轮床的轮子相当烦人，其中一个特别粘，导致推他的人不止一次撞到东西。不过很快，他被推进了一个电梯，尽管由于视线受限，很难确定。

And the lack of real clothing was something he had become acutely aware of. Especially as his rather… exposed extremities were getting a bit more of a breeze than he was accustomed to due to the thin medical ground. He really didn't want to be shivering while no less than 4 men had guns trained on him, sudden movements, and all that.  
而他对于身上衣物缺失的状况已变得异常敏感。特别是由于那层薄薄的医疗垫，他那相当...暴露在外的四肢比平时多了几分凉风，这让他颇不习惯。他实在不想在至少四支枪瞄准自己的情况下还瑟瑟发抖，毕竟任何突然动作都可能引发不测。

_It was rather humorous having Soryu standing there among them, making faces at the guards who were oblivious to their tormentor.  
索留站在他们中间，对着那些对折磨者一无所知的守卫做鬼脸，这情景颇为滑稽。_

"All cardio functions appear normal, no signs of paralysis either."  
所有心肺功能显示正常，也没有瘫痪的迹象。

Yeah, no signs so far… it wasn't like they let him get up and walk yet. From what he could tell that girl was talking on a phone, there was no one else there speaking, not a single word from the guards.  
是的，目前没有迹象……他们还没让他站起来走动。据他所知，那个女孩正在打电话，那里没有其他人说话，守卫们一言不发。

"Yes, his eyes are open."  
“是的，他的眼睛睁开了。”

The girl leaned over in front of him, with some sort of translucent screen with an eye tracker between them.  
女孩倾身向前，两人之间隔着一块带有眼球追踪器的半透明屏幕。

"Can you understand what I'm saying to you?"  
“你能听懂我在说什么吗？”

"Go away," he muttered to her, he just wanted to sleep in peace, not that any of his dreams would let him of course.  
“走开，”他低声对她说，他只想安静地睡一觉，当然，他的梦境可不会轻易放过他。

"He's speaking clearly, seems fully cognizant."  
"他说得清楚，看起来完全清醒。"

He growled a bit "That's subjective...".  
他低吼了一声，“那很主观……”

"No, he hasn't exhibited signs of a continuity of memory, only irritation."  
"不，他没有表现出记忆连贯的迹象，只有恼怒。"

"Oh, you're in for a surprise…" He muttered to himself; he was pretty sure the girl hadn't heard that.  
“哦，你可有惊喜等着呢……”他喃喃自语；他相当确定那女孩没听到这话。

She moved so he could see her again, he could tell since she blocked the rhythmic lights that indicated they were moving. Closing his eyes, he figured he could get some sleep while they went wherever it was they were going. Probably somewhere to throw him into an EVA if he had to guess.  
她挪动身体，让他能再次看到她，他能察觉到，因为她挡住了表示他们在移动的有节奏的灯光。他闭上眼睛，心想在他们去往任何地方的途中，自己或许可以小睡一会儿。如果他得猜的话，大概是去某个地方把他扔进太空服里。

The blocking of the rhythmic passing of lights told him she was leaning over him again, but he refused to open his eyes, whatever she was going to ask now, it wasn't worth answering.  
灯光有节奏地掠过被阻挡的迹象告诉他，她又俯身在他上方了，但他拒绝睁开眼睛，无论她现在要问什么，都不值得回答。

"Do you recognize this person?"  
"你认识这个人吗？"

"Probably, now go away.". He probably should have been nicer, the girl seemed nice enough, he almost felt bad that she had to deal with him. 'How to handle ageless 14-year-olds' probably wasn't in the NERV handbook.  
"可能吧，现在走开。" 他本该更友善些的，这女孩看起来挺不错，他几乎觉得让她应付自己有些过意不去。《NERV 手册》中大概没有“如何应对永恒的 14 岁少年”这一条。

"I need you to open your eyes please."  
"请睁开眼睛。"

He sighed and did as asked, only because that voice lacked any malice or irritation at his behavior. In front of him, the same face he had seen in an incalculable number of mirrors stared back at him. Those deep blue eyes that had witnessed more than any of them had ever dared dream.  
他叹了口气，照做了，只因那声音中没有丝毫恶意或对他的行为感到恼怒。在他面前，那张在无数镜中见过的熟悉面孔回望着他。那双深邃的蓝眼睛，见证了他们中无人敢梦想的种种。

Shinji Ikari, Third Children, Pilot of Evangelion Unit-01.  
碇真嗣，第三适格者，EVA 初号机驾驶员。

A Failure. Again. 又是一次失败。

"Oh yeah, that's Shinji Ikari, now can you let him sleep?"  
"哦，对，那是碇真嗣，现在能让他继续睡吗？"

His eyes drifted downwards, to the collar now locked around his neck. He recognized the black and red band; it wasn't the first time he had to deal with Ritsuko's great inventions. He also noted his missing pendant, not that he really expected it to be there, someone must have confiscated it as soon as they saw it.  
他的目光缓缓下移，落在现在锁在他脖子上的项圈。他认出了那黑红相间的带子；这已经不是他第一次面对赤木律子的伟大发明了。他还注意到他丢失的吊坠，虽然他并不真的指望它还在那里，一定是有人一看到它就把它没收了。

"Oh, that's fun, it's been a while since I had one of these..." He said lazily, before shutting his eyes again.  
"哦，真有趣，我已经很久没戴过这种东西了..."他懒洋洋地说道，然后再次闭上了眼睛。

"I need a straight answer." The girl said.  
"我需要一个直截了当的答案。" 女孩说道。

"Sorry, I'm not in the mood to play twenty questions," he replied simply.  
"抱歉，我没心情玩二十问，" 他简单地回答。

"I can't get a straight answer." She said, presumably to whoever was on the other side of her commlink.  
"我得不到一个直截了当的答案。" 她对着通讯器另一头的人说道。

There were no questions after that, instead, their ride had stopped, and the opening of doors only lead to them stopping his gurney somewhere new. Not that he bothered to open his eyes.  
自那之后，再无人提问，取而代之的是，他们的车停了下来，车门开启，只是将他的担架推到了一个新的地方。不过，他连眼皮都懒得抬一下。

"Subject BM-03 now in custody."  
"对象 BM-03 已被拘留。"

Shinji lamented the idea of being called 'Subject' if these people thought they were going to be experimenting on him, they had another thing coming. He had his share of those experiences for plenty of lifetimes.  
真嗣对被称为'实验体'的想法感到悲哀，如果这些人以为他们能对他进行实验，那他们可就大错特错了。他经历过足够多的人生，对此早已司空见惯。

"Roger, undo the restraints."  
“罗杰，解开束缚。”

That was Misato's voice. 那是美里小姐的声音。

Well then. 那么好吧。

The metallic clamps released, the sound of their hinges unlocking reverberated in what apparently was a rather large room.  
金属夹具松开，它们的铰链解锁声在显然相当宽敞的房间里回荡。

"You may leave now." Only the sound of safety being engaged told him the guards with guns were the ones receiving orders.  
“你们现在可以离开了。”只有安全装置被启动的声音告诉他，那些持枪的守卫是接到命令的人。

Shinji figured he would at least get up and stretch, he was sure that he'd probably open his eyes to see the familiar face of EVA Unit-01, but instead, all he found was another unfamiliar ceiling.  
真嗣心想，至少应该起床伸展一下，他确信自己睁开眼会看到熟悉的 EVA 初号机面孔，但映入眼帘的却是一片陌生的天花板。

Pushing himself up, Shinji relished the popping of his joints and stretched leisurely while taking in the sight around him.  
真嗣撑起身子，享受着关节的噼啪声，悠闲地伸展着，同时环顾四周。

It was a spherical room, with possible over a dozen circular what looked like windows on one side. A whole multilevel structure of seats sprawled out like a rib cage with each one seemingly a terminal of some sort.  
这是一个球形房间，一侧可能有十几个圆形的窗户。整个多层结构的座位像肋骨一样展开，每个座位似乎都是一个终端。

And at each one, a pair of eyes focused on him, all of them giving him looks ranging from annoyance to pure disdain. They weren't the three he knew, but what did it matter anyway? On a platform above the group, someone in a red trench coat stood, not bothering to even turn to look at him.  
每经过一处，都有一双眼睛紧盯着他，目光从恼怒到纯粹的蔑视不等。这些并非他所熟悉的那三位，但那又如何？在高处的平台上，一个身着红色风衣的人站立着，连回头看他一眼的兴趣都没有。

"_What a cheery group," Soryu quipped, walking around and leaning in to examine them._  
“真是一群欢乐的家伙，”Soryu 打趣道，绕着他们走了一圈，凑近观察。

Shaking his head, Shinji just stood up and started walking towards a window, rubbing his arms for warmth as he went and hissing at the bitter cold of the metal under his feet. This world was definitely a write-off, if this was his introduction to NERV then he might as well call it quits right now.  
真嗣摇了摇头，站起身来，开始向一扇窗户走去，边走边搓着双臂取暖，对脚下金属的刺骨寒冷发出嘶嘶声。如果这就是他对 NERV 的初次印象，那么这个世界无疑已经无可救药，他或许现在就该放弃。

"Shinji Ikari, can we call him that?"  
"碇真嗣，我们可以这么称呼他吗？"

Again, that was Misato's voice, but where was she exactly?  
又是美里小姐的声音，但她到底在哪里呢？

Lookup up again it was that jacketed figure talking with someone behind her, the voices were hushed enough that he could just barely hear bits and pieces. Clad in a hat and something over her eyes, Shinji couldn't recognize them.  
再次抬头，只见那个穿着夹克的人正与她身后的人交谈，声音压得很低，以至于他只能勉强听到零星片段。戴着帽子和遮住眼睛的东西，真嗣无法辨认出她们。

"…Captain Katsuragi." "…葛城队长。"

"Oh, that's Misato…" he whispered to himself. Suddenly a beeping and buzzing started to emanate from his collar, perfect, just one more thing.  
"哦，那是美里…" 他自言自语道。突然，一阵哔哔声和嗡嗡声从他的衣领处传来，完美，又多了一件麻烦事。"

"C'mon, you'll have to do better than a bomb collar." He said, reaching up and rubbing it.  
"来吧，你得用比炸弹项圈更厉害的手段才行。" 他说着，伸手去揉了揉它。"

"You'll never be allowed to take…" that girl that had asked him so many questions started but was interrupted as an alarm rang out.  
"你永远不被允许带走……"那个问了他许多问题的女孩开口道，但话未说完就被一阵警报声打断。

A wall of red hexagons appeared, reading flashing 'EMERGENCY', just like had at NERV's command bridge.  
一堵红色六边形的墙出现，上面闪烁着'紧急情况'的字样，就像在 NERV 指挥桥上看到的那样。

Shinji rolled his eyes "Another Sachiel" he grumbled, but it was drowned out by the ringing alarms and the flurry of callouts from those manning the bridge.  
真嗣翻了个白眼，"又是一个萨基尔"他咕哝着，但他的声音被响亮的警报声和桥上人员此起彼伏的呼叫声淹没了。

"_Hey, you think Wondergirl's been hanging around a bit longer than usual?" Soryu whispered to him, having already investigated each of the crew there._  
“嘿，你觉得奇迹女孩是不是比平时待得更久了点？” 索留悄声对他说，已经逐一打量过在场的每个船员。

Confused, Shinji looked around for what she was talking about only to lock onto the patch of blue hair. Sure enough, there was Rei Ayanami or at least something that looked like her.  
困惑中，真嗣四处张望，想弄明白她在说什么，结果目光锁定在一抹蓝色头发上。果然，那是绫波零，或者说至少看起来像她。

She was standing in front of one of his former guards, waving her hand in front of his face, seemingly trying to get a reaction from him. Clad in her school uniform, it was jarring, to say the least.  
她正站在他以前的一名护卫面前，挥手试图引起对方的反应。穿着校服的她，说实在的，显得有些格格不入。

"Wait, what?" “等等，什么？”

She disappeared only to reappear next to the girl with the beret, doing the same thing, trying to get a reaction as the girl leaned down and stowed the gurney away with some straps against the wall. When he watched Rei actually touch the girl and saw that hand went through her did it really start to interest him.  
她消失后随即出现在戴贝雷帽的女孩旁边，做着同样的事情，试图引起反应，而那女孩则俯身用几根带子将担架固定在墙边。当他看到丽真正触碰到那女孩，而手却穿过了她时，这才真正引起了他的兴趣。

"That's… not normal." “那……不正常。”

Just watching the blue-haired girl go around and try to make contact with anyone had drawn his attention away from the shouting between the bridge crew. It wasn't like he would actually understand what was happening anyway. Something about antigravity and systems not being completed. He shivered again and moved his feet, maybe fixing the heat would be a good place to start.  
仅仅是看着蓝发女孩四处尝试与他人接触，就让他从桥员间的争吵中分了心。反正他也不可能理解发生了什么。似乎是关于反重力和系统未完成的问题。他又打了个寒颤，挪了挪脚，或许先解决供暖问题是个不错的开始。

"Asuka?!" “明日香？！”

He swung around at that callout, watching Misato call into a PA mic, it was hard to tell if she was still watching him with those glasses, on. Why exactly did she need them anyway?  
听到那声呼喊，他猛地转过身，看到美里正对着扩音器喊话，很难判断她是否还戴着眼镜注视着他。话说回来，她究竟为什么需要那副眼镜呢？

"It's up to you." “由你决定。”

Soon after a shadow passed behind him and spinning around Shinji saw the massive body of Unit-02… swimming. So, they were underwater? This was a ship?  
不久后，一个影子从他身后掠过，转身一看，真嗣看到了 Unit-02 那庞大的身躯……在游泳。这么说，他们是在水下？这是一艘船吗？

Interestingly he noted the flotation device around its chest and the UPV she was holding onto.  
有趣的是，他注意到它胸前的浮力装置和它紧握的 UPV。

"_Well, only took us how many lives but it looks like you don't have to worry about Gaghiel ever again, huh?"_  
“好吧，虽然我们经历了那么多条命，但看来你再也不用担心加吉尔了，对吧？”

"Alright," he clenched his fist. If he was out there alone…  
"好吧，"他紧握拳头。如果他独自一人在外……

"Misato, what about me?" he called up to the 'Captain'.  
"美里，那我呢？"他朝着'舰长'喊道。

"All hands condition one, battle stations." She called out, ignoring his question.  
"全体注意，一级战备，战斗岗位。"她喊道，无视了他的问题。

The room turned red as low visibility lights replaced other white lights. The massive rib-like structure began to shift, and the sound of hydraulic actuators rang out as the seats began to rise into the air.  
房间内光线骤变，低可见度的红灯取代了原本的白光。巨大的肋骨状结构开始移动，液压驱动器的声响随之响起，座椅缓缓升入空中。

But no one gave him an answer.  
但无人回应他。

His fist began to shake "MISATO!" He shouted, causing the bridge to fall dead silent.  
他的拳头开始颤抖，“美里！”他大喊一声，整个舰桥顿时陷入死寂。

"Let me help her! Get me in an EVA and let me help Asuka!"  
"让我帮她！给我穿上 EVA，让我帮助明日香！"

Shinji didn't care if he was even supposed to know what was happening here. He needed to help her, he needed to fight alongside her.  
真嗣不在乎他是否应该知道这里发生了什么。他需要帮助她，他需要与她并肩作战。

"Listen closely Ikari," she said, taking off her glasses and glaring, "you will stay here until this is over, then I'll decide your fate."  
"听好了，碇，"她摘下眼镜，目光锐利地盯着他，"你将留在这里，直到这一切结束，然后我会决定你的命运。"

The structure rose ever higher, until four sections of a sphere came over it, cutting it off from the rest of the room as the whole sphere retracted further.  
结构不断升高，直到一个球体的四个部分覆盖其上，将它与房间的其他部分隔离开来，整个球体进一步回缩。

The boy just blinked. What the hell was that about? What kind of world was this?  
男孩只是眨了眨眼。那到底是怎么回事？这是个什么样的世界？

"_Well, that went well," Soryu said._  
“嗯，进展顺利，”Soryu 说。

His attention turned back to Rei, who was nowhere to be seen, not that it was too surprising, but it had been strange for her to stick around for so long.  
他的注意力转回到丽身上，却发现她已不见踪影，虽然这并不令人意外，但她逗留如此之久确实有些奇怪。

His hand reached up to grab the Greek cross around his neck, only to grasp nothing. Remembering that it had been gone before he just shook his head and turned around to the red vastness and stared out at it.  
他伸手去抓挂在脖子上的希腊十字架，却只抓了个空。想起它早已不见，他只是摇了摇头，转身面对那片红色的广袤，凝视着远方。

Perhaps he should make a run for it, there was no point in being here if he was just some prisoner. Maybe this was some sort of clone life? That'd be pretty strange. It wasn't like he could run away while the four guards were here either, though just fast-tracking this life to its logical end seemed pretty enticing.  
或许他应该逃跑，如果他只是个囚犯，留在这里毫无意义。也许这是某种克隆生活？那可真是匪夷所思。不过，有四名守卫在场，他也无法逃脱，尽管直接加速这段生命走向其逻辑终点颇具诱惑。

"_And here I thought you gave up your deathwish lifestyle a long time ago," Soryu grumbled, leaning against the glass._  
“我还以为你很久以前就放弃了那种寻死的生活方式呢。”草薙嘟囔着，靠在玻璃上。

He was about to retort when the whole room began to shake, a deep rumbling was coming from somewhere, and he grabbed the nearest wall to brace himself just as everyone else did.  
他正要反驳，整个房间突然开始摇晃，一阵低沉的隆隆声从某处传来，他赶紧抓住最近的墙壁稳住自己，其他人也纷纷如此。

The view from the window changed, the red was soon replaced with blue sky, and he watched wide-eyed as it rose ever higher into the sky.  
窗外的景色变了，红色很快被蓝天取代，他睁大眼睛看着它不断升空，越来越高。

"What the hell is this thing?" He asked the girl across the room, who was doing her best to stay upright as well.  
“这到底是什么鬼东西？”他向房间对面那个同样努力保持直立的女孩问道。

She was about to say something before the entire room rocked to one side, sending two guards flying as they lost their grip.  
她正要开口说话，整个房间突然向一侧倾斜，两名守卫因失去抓握而飞了出去。

"The artificial gravity isn't working!" she yelled as again the whole room rocked in the opposite direction.  
“人工重力失效了！”她大喊道，随即整个房间又朝相反方向摇晃起来。

Shinji's grip was slipping from the railing he had latched onto, finally, he was sent flying with the others there.  
真嗣紧抓栏杆的手开始滑脱，最终，他和其他人一样被甩飞出去。

_Soryu seemed unimpressed by everything as she just stood there, unaffected by the rocking and just watching the calamity unfold with an unamused face.  
惣流似乎对一切都无动于衷，只是站在那里，不受摇晃的影响，面无表情地看着这场灾难展开。_

He was sure at least two of the guards were knocked out, and the girl seemed dazed. Realizing this was his chance, Shinji waited for the right moment, bracing himself each time he landed against another wall.  
他确信至少有两名守卫被击晕了，而那个女孩看起来也有些恍惚。意识到这是他的机会，真嗣等待着合适的时机，每次撞到另一面墙上时都紧紧地稳住自己。

Who the hell was steering this thing?  
这玩意儿到底是谁在驾驶？

Finally managing to grab hold of a railing next to one of the doors leading into the bridge. Shinji hit the control panel next to it, thankfully opening the door.  
终于抓住了通往舰桥的一扇门旁的栏杆，真嗣随即按下旁边的控制面板，庆幸地打开了门。

Moving out into the hallway, it was a bit easier to manage the rapid spinning of the ship, and there were proper things to hold onto while he moved forwards, dodging random bits of debris that hadn't been fastened down.  
走出走廊，处理飞船的快速旋转变得稍微容易些，而且在他向前移动时，有合适的东西可以抓握，躲避着那些未被固定住的随机碎片。

Heading further into the unknown he had to admit, this whole situation was definitely in the running for the strangest world he had woken up to.  
深入未知领域，他不得不承认，这个情况绝对可以竞争他醒来时所处的最奇怪的世界之一。

**Berix – Yeah I think I'm going to just do 'Unit-02i' people shouting out IMPROVED all the time is just weird haha, plus they even call it that in 3.0.  
Berix – 是啊，我想我会直接用‘Unit-02i’，人们总是大喊‘改进版’感觉很奇怪哈哈，而且在 3.0 里他们也这么称呼。**

**Lupeskillz – Thanks for seeing that haha, and hope you enjoy the next few too.  
Lupeskillz – 谢谢你注意到这一点哈哈，希望接下来的几部你也会喜欢。**

**calborghete – "Ladies and gentlemen… fasten your seatbelts."

**Guest – Oh, yeah haha.  
客人 – 哦，哈哈，是啊。**

**Alright, here we are. What's going to happen next? Will Asuka find out about Shinji being alive? Why is Misato treating Shinji like an enemy? Why is there a vision of Rei walking around? And who hired that mantience crew? The heat now the antigrav? Find out next time on Drag… oh wait, *ahem* Relapse**:∣▍!  
好了，我们到了。接下来会发生什么？明日香会发现真嗣还活着吗？为什么美里把真嗣当敌人对待？为什么会有绫波零在四处走动的幻象？还有，是谁雇佣了那个维修队？现在又是反重力装置？敬请期待下集《拖……哦，等等，咳咳* 复发：∣▍！》

**Until Next Time. 下次再会。**


### Chapter 43: "…Running Near on Empty …"  
Chapter 43: "…在空虚边缘奔跑…"

Floating to the surface, Asuka watched wide-eyed at the spectacle above her.  
浮上水面，明日香瞪大眼睛注视着上方壮观的景象。

The _Wunder_, the ship that they had worked so hard towards, was making mincemeat out of the Nemesis Class that had surrounded them. She watched as it maneuvered through the air, defying logic as the massive craft spun and weaved like a nimble jet.  
他们为之付出巨大努力的飞船‘奇迹号’，正将包围他们的涅墨西斯级战舰撕成碎片。她看着它在空中灵活穿梭，这庞大的飞行器如同敏捷的喷气机般旋转腾挪，违背了常理。

Now running wouldn't be their first option, now they could stand up to anything that came their way. A ship with enough firepower to blast through any EVA that NERV could muster.  
现在，逃跑不再是他们的首选，他们能够直面任何来袭之敌。这艘战舰火力强大，足以击穿 NERV 所能派出的任何 EVA。

She brought her right hand up to her chest, gripping the cross which gave her a sense of comfort. Her arm still tingled from the newly attached appendage for Unit-02, but it was nothing detrimental.  
她将右手举至胸前，紧握着给予她安慰的十字架。她的手臂因新安装在二号机上的部件而微微发麻，但这并无大碍。

As she waited Unit-02 rocked back and forth with the rolling of the waves, she was thankful that the cold wouldn't reach her in here. Despite her hatred of LCL, it did have its advantages.  
当她等待时，二号机随着波浪的起伏前后摇摆，她庆幸寒冷不会在这里侵袭她。尽管她憎恨 LCL，但它确实有其优势。

Soon enough, the massive shadow of _Wunder_ came over her, and a crane arm reached down to pick up the Evangelion.  
不久，Wunder 巨大的阴影笼罩了她，一只起重机臂伸下来抓住了福音战士。

"You did it Unit-01." “你做到了，初号机。”

ʡʘʘʘʢ

Judging by the absolute chaos that was the hallways of this ship, Shinji guessed the rest of the crew hadn't faired any better than him.  
从这艘船走廊里一片混乱的景象来看，真嗣猜测其他船员的情况也好不到哪儿去。

He had crawled along as whoever was at the helm threw the craft around in unbelievable maneuvers, spinning, inverting, you name it. He had found some success in slowly crawling along the walls, grasping at any exposed supports or wiring while the G-forces constantly changed, pulling him in different directions.  
他像虫子一样匍匐前进，而驾驶舱里的人正以不可思议的技巧操纵着飞船，旋转、翻转，无所不用其极。他发现沿着墙壁慢慢爬行颇有成效，抓住任何裸露的支撑物或电线，而 G 力不断变化，将他拉向不同的方向。

Then there was the debris.  
更别提那些四处飞散的碎片了。

More often than not, loose cargo, crates, tools, or just about anything could come flying down either direction. A particular wrench nearly took him out, but luckily, he would instead have a massive bruise on his arm for a while.  
往往如此，散落的货物、板条箱、工具，或是任何东西都可能从任一方向飞来。一个特别的扳手差点让他出局，但幸运的是，他只是手臂上会留下一大块淤青，持续一段时间。

Nearing a four-way interception, it seemed the ship was in a vertical dive or climb and spinning. Fighting the centrical forces, Shinji steadied himself at what was not a ledge of a vertical shaft.  
接近一个四向交叉口时，飞船似乎在进行垂直俯冲或爬升并旋转。抵抗着离心力，真嗣稳住自己站在那并非垂直井道的边缘上。

Catching his breath, he looked up at the sound of shouting only to see the falling body of a crewmember. He couldn't tell, but he figured it was the persons named being called out, and judging by the ragdoll nature of the person, he suspected they were unconscious. The boy sighed as he took a step back and timed his jump.  
喘息间，他听到喊声抬头望去，却只看到一名船员坠落的身影。他无法确定，但猜测那是在呼喊某个人的名字，而从那人如布偶般的姿态来看，他推测对方已经昏迷。少年叹了口气，后退一步，调整好跳跃的时机。

Launching forwards, he collided with them and pushed them into the adjacent hallway, but Shinji himself nearly came up short, grasping at the corner and pulling himself up by a bundle of cables.  
他猛地向前冲去，与他们相撞并推入相邻的走廊，但真嗣自己差点没跟上，抓住墙角，借助一捆电缆将自己拉起。

Steadying himself again as the ship spun more, he crouched down next to the crewmember he had just saved. Pulling off the anti-flash hood, he raised an eyebrow at the sight before him.  
随着飞船再次旋转，他稳住自己，蹲在刚刚救下的船员旁边。他摘下防闪光头罩，看到眼前的景象，不禁挑了挑眉。

"_He's our age…" Soryu muttered as the phantom knelt down next to him._  
“他和我们同龄……”惣流低声说道，幻影在他身边跪下。

The uniform was foreign to him, a red jumpsuit and white vest that, judging by the thickness, was either a flak jacket or a life preserver. Written on the jumpsuit the words 'Damage Control' were rather crudely stitched in.  
这套制服对他来说很陌生，一件红色连体衣和白色背心，从厚度判断，要么是防弹衣，要么是救生衣。连体衣上粗陋地缝着“损害管制”几个字。

And on the left arm, a blue handkerchief of some sort.  
左臂上还绑着一块蓝色的手帕。

The teenager seemed to be around his age, blonde, and the kid definitely could use a shower, reeking of diesel fuel. A small gash on his forehead concerned him and Shinji looked around his immediate area for anywhere to drag the boy. Only a few feet away, he spotted a doorway that was on what would be his 'floor'.  
这个少年看起来和他年纪相仿，金发，身上柴油味浓重，显然急需洗个澡。他额头上的小伤口让真嗣担心，环顾四周寻找能拖动这孩子的地方。几英尺外，他发现了一扇门，位于他所谓的“楼层”上。

Checking the room, it appeared to be some sort of small storage closet but was completely empty, it was perfect. He dragged the unconscious boy to the ledge and hopped in what was only a small hole. Dragging him further, he started to swap clothes, which was easier said than done, especially as the world once again began to spin.  
环顾房间，这里似乎是个小储物间，但空无一物，正合他意。他将昏迷的男孩拖到窗台边，跳进那个仅容一人通过的小洞。继续拖拽着男孩，他开始更换衣物，说起来容易做起来难，尤其是当世界再次开始旋转时。

_He could hear laughter and once again Soryu was standing in the cramped room, completely unaffected by forces that had been sending him flying.  
他听到笑声，索鲁又一次站在了这狭小的房间里，完全不受那些曾将他抛来抛去的力量的影响。_

"_Seriously, you have no idea how funny this is."_  
“说真的，你完全不知道这有多好笑。”

Luckily it was easier to steady himself inside a small space as opposed to the long hallways and this torture would end soon enough. After making sure the unconscious boy didn't get hurt as the ship inverted once more, Shinji said a silent thanks as his world orientated itself properly, and he opened the door to see the absolute mess left in the halls.  
幸运的是，在狭小空间内稳住自己比在长长的走廊里要容易得多，这种折磨很快就会结束。在确保失去意识的男孩在飞船再次翻转时不会受伤后，真嗣默默地感谢着世界恢复正常，他打开门，看到了走廊里一片狼藉。

Shrugging, he zipped up the jumpsuit properly and clipped the vest over it. The outfit was probably a size too large but he would manage. Propping his unknowing benefactor into a sitting upright position, Shinji took the blue handkerchief and folded it, before tearing a piece of the medical ground that he had put the boy in.  
他耸了耸肩，将连体衣拉链拉好，扣上背心。这套衣服可能大了一号，但他会应付过去的。将不知情的好心人扶成坐直的姿势，真嗣拿起蓝色的手帕折叠起来，然后撕下一块医疗垫，那是他之前让男孩躺在上面的。

Placing the handkerchief against his skin, he wrapped the torn fabric around his head, figuring he stymie the bleeding. Walking into the hallway he pulled the fireproof hood over his head and looked back at the kid one more time to make sure he was firmly in place.  
他将手帕贴在皮肤上，用撕裂的布料缠绕头部，心想这样或许能止住流血。走进走廊，他拉起防火头罩盖过头，又回头看了一眼那孩子，确保他稳稳地待在原位。

His hand went to shut the door, but he hesitated and looked at the red color now spreading to the surface of his makeshift dressing. Sighing, he only closed it halfway and placed a bit of debris in the doorway so that someone would notice.  
他的手伸向门准备关上，但犹豫了一下，目光落在临时包扎处逐渐蔓延的红色上。叹了口气，他只将门半掩，并在门口放了些碎屑，以便有人注意到。

He looked down both ways of the hall, seeing no one at first. And then placed a box in the center of the passageway so that it would garner more attention.  
他向走廊两端望去，起初没看到任何人。随后，他将一个箱子放在通道中央，以吸引更多注意。

Looking back up he had expected to see no one, but instead, the white plugsuit of Rei Ayanami pass in his vision.  
再次抬头时，他本以为会空无一人，却意外地瞥见了绫波零身穿的白色插头服掠过视野。

This disguise would buy him some time, but he figured he should at least try to talk to the blue-haired figure. If she was sticking around this long, she probably wanted to talk.  
这伪装能为他争取些时间，但他认为至少该尝试与那位蓝发身影交谈。她若在此逗留如此之久，想必是有话要说。

"_Oh, now we're on a wild goose chase, perfect!" Soryu shouted from behind him, as he took off down the hallway._  
“哦，现在我们开始了捉迷藏的游戏，太棒了！”草薙从他身后喊道，随即沿着走廊飞奔而去。

ʡʘʘʘʢ

"So this is the god slayers power," Ritsuko mumbled, "_Wunder_ a fitting name for a ship of hope."  
“这就是弑神者的力量，”律子喃喃自语，“奇迹号，一艘承载希望的船，名副其实。”

Misato just stood there, unable to say anything.  
美里只是站在那里，一句话也说不出来。

They had won. 他们赢了。

And for the first time it felt as if it wasn't a close call, it felt like they had been the ones to outclass their opponent.  
而这是第一次，感觉胜利并非险胜，仿佛是他们真正超越了对手。

"All stations stand down to Condition two." She ordered, "prepare to recover Unit-02."  
“所有站点进入二级戒备状态。”她命令道，“准备回收 02 号单位。”

As their command sphere opened Misato hadn't really expected their prisoner to still be on the bridge, but she also hadn't expected all of his guards as well as his assigned medical personnel to be sprawled out over the bridge.  
当他们的指挥舱打开时，美里并没有真的期望他们的囚犯还在舰桥上，但她也没有预料到他的所有守卫以及指定的医疗人员都横七竖八地躺在舰桥上。

Rushing down, Ritsuko and her checked them over, eliciting more than one groan of pain. If the artificial gravity had failed here, was there anywhere on the ship that it had actually worked?  
急忙赶下楼，律子和她检查了他们的情况，引来了不止一声痛苦的呻吟。如果这里的人工重力失效了，那么这艘船上还有哪里是有效的呢？

"Where is BM-03?!" she demanded, the voice carrying more than just command in it, it carried fear too.  
"BM-03 在哪里？！" 她厉声问道，声音中不仅带着命令，还透露出恐惧。

The young medic grumbled something, but it wasn't useful. As she looked around all she saw were the other four guards assigned to the boy and finally, the gravity of the situation fell on her.  
年轻的医疗兵咕哝了些什么，但并不中用。当她环顾四周，只看到另外四名被指派给那男孩的守卫，终于，情况的严重性压在了她心头。

"Raise alert back to level one, search ever damn compartment, we have a prisoner loose in the ship!"  
"将警报调回一级，搜查每一个该死的隔间，我们有囚犯在船上逃脱了！"

ʡʘʘʘʢ

Asuka looked up at the rotary cradle that held Unit-02. Dripping LCL, the girl didn't care that she would be making a mess, she wanted to see the whole process for the first time.  
明日香抬头望向承载着二号机的旋转吊架。滴落的 LCL 液体，女孩并不在意自己会弄得一团糟，她只想亲眼目睹这第一次的全过程。

The rotary cradle could hold three EVAs each and they had two, one port and one starboard. It was ridiculous to have kept the whole contraptions in the first place. Maybe it was about redundancy, but even the thought of having six EVAs was absurd. They could barely keep the two they had operational.  
旋转吊架能容纳三台 EVA，而他们有两座，一座在左舷，一座在右舷。原本保留这些装置就颇为荒谬。或许是出于冗余考虑，但即便设想拥有六台 EVA 也显得荒诞不经。他们连维持现有的两台正常运作都捉襟见肘。

She watched as Unit-02 was brought higher, and just frowned as the last bits of water ran off its armor. The mismatched and rusty armor panels were a testament to just how stretched their resources were, even though red was the predominant color on the EVA. With each year it seemed there was something else to be fixed, more maintenance time needed, or just another rare part to be replaced.  
她看着二号机被缓缓升起，皱眉看着最后几滴水从装甲上滑落。那些不匹配且锈迹斑斑的装甲板，正是他们资源紧张的明证，尽管红色仍是 EVA 的主色调。每年似乎总有新的部件需要修理，更多的维护时间需求，或是另一个稀有零件需要更换。

She was sure eventually they would have to scrap the thing and find a new one for her to pilot. That alone was a nightmare she really didn't want to think about.  
她确信，最终他们不得不报废这台机器，为她寻找一台新的来驾驶。光是这一点，就足以成为她不愿深思的噩梦。

Asuka began to walk to the showers while grumbling at the dull pain in her left leg which left her with a small limp. What she wouldn't do for her brace at the moment. Luckily, she could put it on after their debriefing and they'd be sitting for that too. The girl shivered at the light drizzle of water running off the behemoth, no heat at altitude was going to be a real drag.  
明日香开始一瘸一拐地走向淋浴间，左腿隐隐作痛让她忍不住嘟囔。此刻她多么希望能戴上护具。好在汇报结束后她就能穿上，而且汇报时他们也得坐着。女孩打了个寒颤，雨水从巨兽般的机体上滴落，高空无热源真是让人难受。

Heading into the lockers, she didn't even bat an eye at the pink-clad girl who had beat her there and stepped under a showerhead while reaching for the handles.  
走进更衣室，她对那个已经先到一步、身穿粉色衣服的女孩视若无睹，径直走到一个淋浴头下，伸手去拧开关。

"Oh, hello princess, have a nice swim?" she asked with a smile, her glasses were completely fogged up from the steam.  
“哦，你好啊，公主，游得愉快吗？”她微笑着问道，眼镜被蒸汽完全蒙上了一层雾。

Asuka said nothing as she turned the water on, scrubbing the hardening clumps of LCL out of her hair and off her plugsuit. There was no reason for them to undress, they could do that in their cabins. It was standard procedure to wear plugsuit constantly while underway After all, there was no knowing when they would face an attack after all.  
明日香一言不发地打开水龙头，用力搓洗着头发上硬化的 LCL 凝块和插头服上的残留物。他们没有必要在这里脱衣服，可以在各自的舱室内进行。在航行期间，始终穿着插头服是标准程序，毕竟，谁也无法预料何时会遭遇攻击。

She held her pendent under the stream of water and just watched as the LCL was washed off it while the red stain remained. It had taken every abuse she had thrown at it, but there was nothing that would rid the cross of that mark.  
她将吊坠置于水流下，静静地看着 LCL 被冲刷干净，而那抹红色污迹依旧残留。无论她施加何种折磨，都无法抹去十字架上的那道痕迹。

Finishing, she lamented the rapidly evaporating heat and went to her locker to grab a towel and more clothing. She just looked over the patches applied to her suit, each eliciting a memory of the battles that had cased them. Unit-02 wasn't the only thing that had been neglected, though it wasn't like these were easy to replace.  
完工后，她惋惜地看着热量迅速消散，走向储物柜去拿毛巾和更多衣物。她只是瞥了一眼战斗服上新增的补丁，每一个都唤起了那些战斗的记忆。虽然二号机不是唯一被忽视的，但这些补丁也不是那么容易替换的。

"They have hot water but no heat?" she grumbled.  
“他们有热水但没有暖气？”她咕哝着。

"Hey, it's a miracle at all that this thing is flying, it was barely ready. Be honest did you really think that would work?"  
“嘿，这东西能飞起来本身就是个奇迹，它几乎没准备好。说实话，你真的以为那会奏效吗？”

"_Like the colonel always says, mission first, safety last."_  
"就像上校常说的，任务第一，安全最后。"

"It's not the first time Katsuragi's had a crazy plan." She mumbled.  
"这已经不是神楽木第一次提出疯狂的计划了。" 她喃喃自语。"

Mari just sighed "Well at least now we won't have to fight so hard, we have a whole ship that can take on the Nemesis series!"  
真里只是叹了口气 "“至少现在我们不用那么拼命了，我们有一整艘船可以对付复仇女神系列！”"

Asuka was about to counter but ahead popped into their locker area, drawing confused looks from both the girls.  
明日香正要反击，但突然有人闯进了她们的储物区，引得两人都露出了困惑的表情。

"Has anyone else been in here?" they asked through labored breathing.  
“还有其他人进来过吗？”她们喘着粗气问道。

"No," Asuka replied flatly and just glared.  
“没有，”明日香冷冷地回答，只是瞪了一眼。

They only received a slight nod before the person disappeared, the sound of a door closing ringing through the locker room signaled their departure.  
他们只得到了一个轻微的点头，随后那人便消失了，更衣室内回荡着关门声，标志着他们的离去。

"Any idea?" Mari asked, eliciting a shrug from the redhead as she donned her jacket and cap.  
“有什么想法吗？”玛丽问道，红发女子穿上夹克戴上帽子，耸了耸肩。

"Let's go to the debriefing, no need to keep the colonel waiting." The Second Child commented as she walked to the exit.  
“我们去汇报吧，没必要让上校久等。”二号少女边说边走向出口。

"You know she's a captain, right?" Mari shouted, scrambling after her.  
“你知道她是队长吧？”玛丽大喊着，紧追其后。

She didn't get a response as Asuka had already begun her brisk-paced walk, despite her leg, the girl could move it when she wanted to. As the older pilot caught up, she couldn't help but feel there was something… wrong.  
她没有得到回应，因为明日香已经开始快步走动，尽管腿上有伤，但只要她想，她就能行动。当年长的驾驶员赶上时，她不禁觉得有些……不对劲。

There was a typical instinct for crewmembers to move out of the way of the redhead, generally, her cold stare and demeanor were enough to move aside. Now though? It wasn't that they weren't doing just that, it just seemed they were… distracted.  
通常情况下，船员们会本能地避开那位红发少女，她的冷酷目光和态度足以让人让路。但现在呢？并不是他们没有这样做，只是他们似乎……分心了。

More than once someone had accidentally bumped into the girl and earning a quick growl, shove, and 'watch where you're going. They were all scrambling too, not just the damage control specialists, but auxiliary crewmen too. The alert level was also elevated, but they were out of combat, so why did she see crewmembers with PPE on?  
不止一次有人不小心撞到那女孩，随即招来一声低吼、一推和一句‘看路’。大家都在匆忙奔走，不仅是损害管制专家，还有辅助船员。警戒级别也提高了，但他们已脱离战斗，为何她还能看到船员们穿着个人防护装备？

What exactly was happening?  
究竟发生了什么？

Before long both pilots had reached the situation room, the room was awash in the typical light blue hue from the holographic globe in the center of the desk, which also resided in the middle of the room. A dozen people ran about, coordinating something that Asuka couldn't quite grasp yet.  
不久，两位飞行员都到达了情况室，房间被桌子中央的全息地球仪发出的典型淡蓝色光芒所笼罩，地球仪也位于房间正中。十几个人来回奔走，协调着某些阿斯卡还未能完全理解的事情。

"What about the MAGI!" the irritated voice of a certain commanding officer roared.  
“那 MAGI 系统呢！”某位指挥官恼怒的声音咆哮道。

"Please don't rile her up more," Mari whispered to her companion, who refused to give her a response.  
“请别再激怒她了。”玛丽低声对同伴说，但对方拒绝给她任何回应。

"Nothing," Ritsuko called out, causing Misato to slam her hands down on the table.  
"没什么，" 律子喊道，这让美里猛地将双手拍在桌子上。

"That's not good enough! You checked the MAGI, so why the hell is it acting like 10 years ago?!"  
"这还不够好！你检查了 MAGI，那它为什么表现得像十年前一样？！"

"Like what 10 years ago?" Asuka spoke up, causing the room to go silent at the realization the two pilots were there.  
"像十年前什么？" 明日香开口说道，这让房间因意识到两位驾驶员在场而陷入沉默。

"We're here for a debriefing, per your orders," Mari said with a smile.  
“我们遵照您的指示来汇报情况。”玛丽微笑着说。

Asuka instead just looked Misato dead in the eye, "What's going on?" she asked, this time in a firmer voice.  
明日香则直视着美里，“到底怎么回事？”她这次用更坚定的语气问道。

"We've had an escapee." The captain replied.  
"我们这儿有个逃犯。" 队长回答道。

"Since when have we captured any NERV personnel?" Asuka asked, crossing her arms.  
"我们什么时候抓过 NERV 的人了？" 明日香交叉双臂问道。

"It's…" Ritsuko spoke up but was cut off by Misato raising her hand to stop her.  
"这个……" 律子刚开口，就被美里举手打断了。

"Your debriefing can wait, go back to your cabins to get some rest."  
"你的汇报可以稍等，先回舱室休息一下。"

Asuka's eye narrowed "Mind telling me just who escaped first?"  
明日香眯起眼睛，“介意告诉我谁先逃走的吗？”

Behind her glasses, Misato also narrowed her eyes "That's none of your concern, it's being handled. Return to your quarters, Pilot Shikinami."  
在她的眼镜后面，美里也眯起了眼睛，“这不关你的事，正在处理中。回到你的宿舍去，式波·明日香。”

"That's an order." Katsuragi's stated, her tone changing to that of cold command.  
“这是命令。”葛城语气一变，冷冷地命令道。

For a few more moments the two of them just stared each other down. No one said a word, not even her fellow pilot, who had learned long ago not to get in between the two during their… scuffles.  
又过了一会儿，两人只是互相瞪着对方。谁也没有说话，甚至连她的副驾驶也没有出声，他早就学会了在他们的……争执中不要插手。

Finally, Asuka turned and stormed out the door, quite swift despite that slight limp.  
终于，明日香转身，尽管有些微跛，还是相当迅速地冲出了门。

Mari quickly followed suit, not wanting to draw any ire from the captain.  
真希波赶紧跟了上去，不想引起队长的任何不满。

ʡʘʘʘʢ

WILLE. WILLE。

That was the name of this place or at least whatever organization this was. If this was some NERV-esc group, then he wouldn't be surprised that the Second Impact was much worse for this world. He had lived lives where the earth's population was below a billion, so that might explain the younger members he was seeing here.  
这就是这个地方的名字，或者至少是这个组织的名称。如果这是一个类似 NERV 的团体，那么他对这个世界第二次冲击造成的后果更加严重就不会感到惊讶了。他经历过地球人口不足十亿的时代，所以这里看到的年轻成员可能就是这种情况的解释。

It hadn't taken much time for people to again roam the halls, initially, it had been to clean the never-ending mayhem that had been spread over the ship, but the callout of an escaped prisoner had sent them all into a frenzy. Luckily, no one was looking for someone dressed just like them.  
人们很快又在大厅里走动起来，起初是为了清理船上不断蔓延的混乱，但逃犯的呼叫让他们陷入了疯狂。幸运的是，没有人寻找一个和他们穿着一样的人。

Soon he was maneuvering through a steady stream of people, following and trying to catch up to the blue hair he could see further down the passage.  
很快，他穿梭在人流中，努力追赶着前方通道里那抹蓝色的头发。

How was he going to get out of this? He had no idea, he'd improvise sure, and this thing had to land sometime. What worried him was he would eventually have to take this hood off; the alert levels couldn't be elevated forever.  
他该如何脱身？毫无头绪，只能即兴发挥，毕竟这东西总得降落。让他担忧的是，他终究得摘下这兜帽；警戒级别不可能永远提升。

As the people began to thin, he quickened his pace, soon he was only a few feet away…  
随着人群逐渐稀疏，他加快了脚步，不久便只差几步之遥……

"HEY!" "嘿！"

He stopped and turned slowly to the voice that had called out to him.  
他停下脚步，缓缓转身面对那个呼唤他的声音。

A middle-aged man strode up to him, clad in a red jumpsuit the same as him.  
一个中年男子大步走向他，身着与他相同的红色连体衣。

"What are you doing over here?" he demanded, his voice was deep yet not as rough as Shinji had expected.  
“你在这儿做什么？”他质问道，声音低沉却不似真嗣预想的那般粗哑。

"Um…" “呃……”

"Let me guess. Rookie." He said, leaning in. He wasn't wearing a hood, so Shinji had a clear view of the crow's feet around his eyes.  
"让我猜猜，新手。" 他说着，身体前倾。他没有戴兜帽，所以真嗣清楚地看到了他眼角的鱼尾纹。

"Yes sir!" he bluffed, standing straight.  
"是的，长官！" 他虚张声势，站得笔直。

"Figured, c'mon, the wings are this way," he said, turning as Shinji figured he could follow him.  
"猜到了吧，来，翅膀在这边，" 他说着转身，真嗣心想自己可以跟着他。

"Good to see you have your anti-flash gear on, at least you got retained something from training." The man commented as he quickened his pace.  
"很高兴看到你穿上了防闪光装备，至少你还记得训练中的某些东西。" 男人说着加快了步伐。

"No bandana huh?" he asked, turning and looking at the boy's arm.  
"没戴头巾啊？" 他转过身，看着男孩的手臂问道。

"I… had to use it to treat a wound."  
"我……得用它来处理伤口。"

The man just nodded approvingly, before turning back around. Shinji turned to look back for Rei, but the girl was gone. This was just getting better and better.  
那男人只是赞许地点了点头，随即转过身去。真嗣回头寻找绫波，但那女孩已经不见了。事情似乎越来越复杂了。

They must have strayed back into a congested area, as swarms of crewmembers lined the halls and Shinji was forced to press against on wall to allow people past.  
他们想必是又走回了拥挤的区域，因为走廊上挤满了船员，真嗣不得不紧贴着墙壁，以便让行人通过。

"Hey, Hisoka! Over here!"  
"嘿，希索加！这边！"

The man stopped, turned down a hallway which Shinji also peered down, a small group of people were standing back from something sparking from the wall.  
那人停下脚步，拐进了一条走廊，真嗣也探头望去，只见一小群人正站在远处，似乎是墙上的什么东西在冒火花。

Turning to him, the man, Hisoka, leaned in.  
他转向真嗣，那人，也就是久世，凑近了些。

"Alright, keep going straight and you're going to go past some officer's cabins, but keep walking, you'll get to a bulkhead and someone will fill you in there."  
“好，继续直走，你会经过一些军官的舱室，但别停下，一直走到一个隔离舱，那里会有人给你详细说明。”

Shinji did as he was told, making little progress as he went. He would keep going straight until he thought he was a decent distance away.  
正如所吩咐的那样，真嗣照做了，尽管进展甚微。他会一直直走，直到他认为已经走得足够远。

Turning away from his route he stopped, standing there at an intersection, two guards with rifles were checking crewmen as they passed by.  
他偏离了路线，停了下来，站在一个十字路口，两名持步枪的警卫正在检查过往的船员。

That definitely wasn't where he was headed.  
那绝对不是他要去的地方。

Promptly continuing on his original path, he constantly had to shift passageways as they were increasingly becoming blocked by these checkpoints. Perhaps Misato had figured their escapee would try to blend in. Perhaps he could squat in some derelict part of the ship? Food would be an issue, but…  
他立刻继续沿着原路前进，但不得不频繁更换通道，因为这些检查点越来越多地阻塞了道路。或许 Misato 已经猜到逃亡者会试图混入人群。也许他可以躲在船上某个废弃的角落？食物会是个问题，但是……

"Hey, you!" “嘿，你！”

Shinji's heart quickened, but he ignored the call and just increased his pace.  
真嗣的心跳加速了，但他没有理会呼喊，只是加快了脚步。

"You in the hood, stop!"  
"你在这儿，停下！"

He was almost running now, maybe he could give them the slip, he just needed to find the right time.  
他现在几乎是跑着了，也许他能甩掉他们，他只需要找到合适的时机。

"I said stop!" "我说了停下！"

He turned back to see just how close they were, now they were running and rapidly approaching. What Shinji couldn't see was himself walking into an intersection, and right into someone.  
他转过身，想看看他们离得有多近，现在他们正奔跑着，迅速逼近。真嗣没看到的是，自己正走向一个十字路口，径直撞上了某个人。

"Ah!" “啊！”

Colliding at a decent stride, whoever it was he hit and him both fell to the ground. The bruise on his arm burned from the impact and he barely cushioned his fall, which earned a quiet hiss of pain. However, the person he had run into had sounded so…  
以相当快的步伐相撞，无论是谁被他撞到，两人都跌倒在地。他手臂上的瘀伤因撞击而灼痛，他几乎没能缓冲跌落，这让他不禁轻声痛呼。然而，被他撞到的那个人听起来却如此……

"What the hell!" “搞什么鬼！”

Familiar. 熟悉的。

Oh no. 哦不。

A flash of red caught his eye and he instantly looked away, before pushing himself to his feet, refusing to make eye contact.  
一抹红色吸引了他的目光，他立刻移开视线，挣扎着站起身来，拒绝与人对视。

"Sorry." He said and turned to run, but he was too late, as someone slammed into his back sending him to the ground. His hood was ripped off and he could feel a pair of cuffs clamp down on his wrists as he struggled against the men.  
“对不起。”他说着转身欲逃，却为时已晚，有人猛地撞上他的后背，将他击倒在地。他的兜帽被扯下，手腕上随即感受到一副手铐的钳制，他在挣扎中对抗着那些人。

"This is Unit 21, we have Shinji Ikari in custody."  
"这里是 21 号单位，我们已经拘留了碇真嗣。"

ʡʘʘʘʢ

"Sorry." "抱歉。"

She knew that voice. 她认得那个声音。

She knew that voice all too well.  
她对那个声音再熟悉不过了。

Asuka whipped around to see the person who had run into her, forgetting now about the searing pain in her leg. She knew that voice.  
明日香猛地转身，想看看撞到她的人是谁，此刻她已经忘记了腿上的剧痛。她认得那个声音。

And the girl never thought she would hear it again outside her nightmares.  
而那个女孩从未想过，除了在噩梦中，她还能再次听到这个声音。

All her eyes landed on was the back of a damage control jumpsuit, belonging to someone who was now rushing to get away from her. The two guards that slammed into his back would keep that from happening and tore off a hood that they threw to the side.  
她目光所及之处，只有一件损害管制连体服的背面，属于一个正急忙逃离她的人。那两名猛撞到他背上的警卫阻止了他的逃脱，并扯下了他头上的兜帽，扔到了一旁。

"This is Unit 21, we have Shinji Ikari in custody."  
“这里是 21 号单位，我们已拘留了碇真嗣。”

Shinji. 真嗣。

Ikari. 碇。

She pushed herself up with a speed that she didn't know she still had. Around her, the crew just stood back, probably scared of getting involved with the guards or the girl herself, but the sounds of boots against metal signaled there were more guards coming.  
她以一种自己都未曾察觉的速度迅速起身。周围的工作人员只是退到一旁，或许是害怕卷入卫兵与女孩之间的纷争，但金属地面上传来的靴子声预示着更多卫兵正在逼近。

"Turn him around," she commanded, but she got no response.  
“让他转过身来，”她命令道，但无人回应。

"Turn him around!" she barked again, but with the arrival of more men with rifles, they quickly pushed past her and blocked those behind them.  
"把他转过来！" 她再次厉声命令，但随着更多持枪男子的到来，他们迅速推开她，挡住了后面的人。

"LET ME SEE HIM!" she roared, shoving herself against one of the men, but to little effect.  
"让我见他！" 她咆哮着，用力推开其中一名男子，但效果甚微。

"We're under orders not to let any pilot have contact with the prisoner." He said simply, as he pushed her away gently.  
"我们有命令，不让任何飞行员接触囚犯。" 他简单地说道，轻轻地将她推开。

"Who's dammed orders?" she growled. Asuka already knew the answer, she just wanted to hear them say it.  
"谁的该死命令？" 她咆哮道。明日香已经知道答案，她只是想听他们亲口说出来。

"Captain Katsuragi has instructed that you are to have no interaction with the prisoner." He said simply.  
"葛城队长指示，你不得与囚犯有任何接触。" 他简单地说道。

Katsuragi. Damn that woman.  
葛城。该死的女人。

Asuka said nothing for a moment, just letting her head dip as the feelings she had tried so hard to forget bubbled up once again, causing her to clench her fists. That woman. That boy…  
明日香一时无言，只是任由自己的头低垂，那些她曾竭力遗忘的情感再次涌上心头，让她不禁握紧了双拳。那个女人。那个男孩……

The Second Child pulled back her arm and punched the man, knocking him to the ground as she pushed past him and into the next layer of guards, kicking, clawing, and punching her way forwards, but it was all in vain. They were larger than her, and the fact there were a half dozen there didn't exactly help either.  
二号机驾驶员猛地收回手臂，一拳将那人击倒在地，随即从他身边挤过，冲向下一层守卫，踢打、抓挠、挥拳，奋力向前，但这一切都是徒劳。他们比她高大，而且半打人手也确实不占优势。

Soon she was pushed back, as they helped their own comrade back up to his feet.  
很快她就被逼退，他们扶起自己的同伴，重新站稳脚跟。

The redhead just stood there, fists clenched as she tried to look over and around them as they pulled the boy on the floor to his feet.  
红发女孩就那样站在那里，拳头紧握，试图从他们身边越过，看着他们把地板上的男孩拉起来。

She needed to see him, she needed to see with her own two eyes that it was really him, that he was really here.  
她需要亲眼见到他，她需要用自己的双眼确认，真的是他，他真的在这里。

For a fleeting moment, she saw the dark hair she remembered, and, even though he wasn't looking at her, she laid eyes on the dark blue orbs she knew all too well.  
在转瞬即逝的瞬间，她看到了那熟悉的深色头发，尽管他没有看向她，她还是凝视着那双她再熟悉不过的深蓝色眼眸。

Swiftly he was carried off, while the rest of the guards followed, a voice came over the intercom system signaling that the alert level was dropping back to normal and behind her, the crowd that had formed was beginning to disperse.  
他迅速被带走，其余的守卫紧随其后，广播系统传来声音，宣布警戒级别正在恢复正常，而她身后聚集的人群也开始逐渐散去。

But she just stood there, not believing what she saw.  
但她只是站在那里，无法相信眼前所见。

"Shinji." “真嗣。”

**UltraSpink of Da USA- Shinji's like, 'Fuck this shit I'm out.'

### Chapter 44: "…Pull the very ground from under you…"  
Chapter 44: "…将你脚下的土地彻底抽离…"

"You're sure?" 你确定吗？

"Yes." "是的。"

"Positive?" "阳性？"

"I _saw_ him." "我看见他了。"

Had she seen it anywhere else, Asuka would have smirked at the incredulous look on her fellow pilot's face. Right now, however, she couldn't have relished it.  
如果是在别的地方看到这一幕，明日香可能会对她的同伴驾驶员脸上那难以置信的表情嗤之以鼻。然而，此刻她却无法从中得到任何快感。

Mari had followed the girl to her room, having lost her in the crowd until she witnessed her comrade trying to fight a six-man squad. Not that she doubted the girl couldn't give them a run for their money on a good day, but it hadn't exactly ended in her favor.  
玛丽跟着女孩来到了她的房间，之前在人群中跟丢了她，直到目睹她的同伴试图与六人小队搏斗。并非她怀疑女孩在状态好时无法让他们付出代价，但结果显然对她不利。

"I'm going to see him," she said as the metallic clicking of a brace finally secured her leg. Asuka stood up and moved it a bit, relishing the relief it was giving.  
"我要去见他，"她一边说，一边听着金属支架终于固定好她的腿时发出的咔嗒声。明日香站起身来，稍微活动了一下腿，享受着支架带来的缓解。

"If it's true Katsuragi didn't want us to know, do you really think she'd let you near him?"  
"如果碇司令真的不想让我们知道，你真的认为她会让你接近他吗？"

"You think she could stop me?"  
"你觉得她能阻止我吗？"

Mari just gulped at the glare the girl was giving her, she had learned long ago that you don't get in the redhead's way and decided it was better to just let this calamity take its course. After all, she didn't need the girl to act on a grudge when they were out in the field.  
玛丽只是对着女孩投来的目光咽了咽口水，她很久以前就学会了不要挡在红发女孩的路上，并决定最好还是让这场灾难自行发展。毕竟，她们在外场时不需要女孩因怨恨而采取行动。

At the lack of objection, Asuka turned and promptly stormed towards her destination, the dull pain in her leg completely forgotten, however her left eye had begun to sting just slightly.  
由于没有反对，明日香转身果断地朝她的目的地走去，腿上的隐痛完全被遗忘了，然而她的左眼开始微微刺痛。

Irate didn't even come close to describing how the girl was feeling right now. She could tear this ship apart in an instance if it meant getting answers.  
‘愤怒’甚至不足以形容女孩此刻的心情。如果这意味着能得到答案，她可以瞬间将这艘船撕成碎片。

Misato had lied. 葛城美里撒了谎。

She had lied to _her_, she knew he was in there and lied.  
她对她撒了谎，她知道他在里面，却撒了谎。

How many other times lies had she told the girl?  
她究竟对那女孩撒了多少次谎？

The few crewmembers that were in the hallway with the girl quickly got out of the way. Each of them knew that they didn't want to be on the receiving end of her fury and none of them wanted to test her after the news had been announced to the crew.  
走廊上与女孩同行的几名船员迅速让开了路。他们都知道，没人想成为她怒火的目标，更没人愿意在消息公布给全体船员后去试探她的底线。

The Third Child was indeed onboard.  
第三适格者确实在船上。

Even if their knowledge was limited, the amount of rumors and speculation they had heard over the years meant everyone was on edge, especially around the redhead.  
即便他们的知识有限，多年来听闻的种种传闻和猜测已足以让每个人都紧张不安，尤其是那位红发女子周围。

The girl half ran as best she could towards the tiny brig of the ship. It was meant more for their own crew than outsiders. It found itself being used for rowdy drunks who had snuck some rare bottles of liquid spirits onboard more often than not.  
女孩尽可能快地跑向船上那狭小的禁闭室。这地方本是为自家船员而非外人准备的。它更多时候被用来关押那些偷偷带上船、喝得烂醉如泥的酒鬼，他们偶尔能搞到几瓶稀罕的烈酒。

Heading up to the only entrance, the single guard posted on duty looked down at her. He was probably in his mid-twenties, pretty skinny, and by the alarmed look in his eye, Asuka figured he was pretty new.  
她走向唯一的入口，站岗的守卫低头看着她。他大概二十五六岁，相当瘦弱，从他惊慌的眼神中，明日香猜想他应该是个新手。

Good. 好。

"The captain instructed only authorized crew is allowed." He said, straightening up, but with a voice as shaky as that, she knew exactly how to get past him.  
"船长指示，只有授权船员才能进入。" 他说道，挺直了身子，但那颤抖的声音让她清楚地知道如何绕过他。

Reaching up she grabbed his uniform and yanked him down to her own eye level, it wasn't hard as he hadn't really been expecting a physical confrontation. For a moment she just let the young man sweat as she bore into his eyes.  
她伸手抓住他的制服，猛地将他拉到与自己视线平齐的高度，这并不难，因为他并未真正预料到会有身体上的冲突。有那么一刻，她只是让这个年轻人紧张地流汗，目光如炬地盯着他的眼睛。

"Is the captain in there at the moment?" she asked, making sure her voice was as intimidating as her stare.  
"队长现在在里面吗？" 她问道，确保自己的声音和目光一样令人畏惧。

"Yes." He blurted out. "是的。" 他脱口而出。

"So, how about I go in and ask her if I'm 'authorized crew'?" Asuka asked in a 'kinder' voice.  
“那我进去问问她，我是不是‘授权船员’？”明日香用一种‘更温和’的语气问道。

The lack of an answer was more than acceptable for her, as she pushed him aside and walked through.  
她对他的沉默并不介意，推开他径直走了过去。

If Katsuragi was there, it meant they would be in interrogation, it wasn't hard to guess which room, after all, there was only one.  
如果克图拉在那里，意味着他们会在审讯室，这不难猜，毕竟只有一个。

Standing in front of the door the girl froze as she brought her hand up to open it, while the other gripped the cross around her neck. She found herself squeezing it a bit too hard, somehow enjoying the edges digging into her skin.  
站在门前，女孩举起手准备开门时突然僵住了，另一只手紧握着脖子上的十字架。她发现自己捏得太紧，某种程度上享受着边缘刺入皮肤的痛感。

What must he be feeling?  
他此刻会是何种感受？

She tried to squash those thoughts down, she shouldn't be feeling anything but malcontent towards the boy, the liar, the one who had abandoned her.  
她试图压制这些念头，她本不该对那个男孩、那个骗子、那个抛弃她的人有任何情感，除了不满。

What did it matter how he felt when he woke up? He certainly had a much more pleasant experience than her...  
他醒来时的感受又有什么关系呢？他显然比她经历了一段更为愉快的时光……

ʡʘʘʘʢ

"I'll come back." “我会回来的。”

*Ahaaa* *啊哈*

_With a painful first breath, the girl opened her eyes to an unfamiliar ceiling.  
女孩带着痛苦的第一次呼吸，睁开双眼，映入眼帘的是一个陌生的天花板。_

_Or at least one eye, instantly she was aware that half her vision was being blocked by something.  
至少睁开了一只眼，她立刻意识到自己的一半视野被什么东西遮挡住了。_

_For the briefest moment confusion ran through her, the memory of talking to Misato as she ascended to the entry plug for Unit-03 come flooding back into her mind as well as the happiness that she had felt.  
在那一瞬间，困惑涌上心头，她回想起与美里交谈的记忆，当时她正登上三号机的插入栓，那份喜悦也随之涌入脑海。_

_Sitting in the plug… looking over those beautiful, lush mountains as Unit-03 activated… then...  
坐在插入栓里……眺望着那些美丽葱郁的山脉，随着三号机的启动……然后……_

_The fear… 那份恐惧……_

_And how she had called out his name…  
她如何呼唤他的名字……_

_How he had somehow helped her, even there…  
尽管在那里，他又是如何以某种方式帮助了她……_

_And train car afterward… the squeeze of his hand… it all came rushing back.  
还有之后的列车车厢……他紧握的手……一切记忆如潮水般涌回。_

_"Shinji" the voice that said his name was a weak raspy thing, barely fitting to be called a voice and much too soft to be heard at any meaningful distance.  
“真嗣”，那个呼唤他名字的声音虚弱而沙哑，几乎不配称之为声音，而且太过轻微，在任何有意义的距离内都难以被听见。_

_She felt weak, she felt light, this all just felt so… wrong.  
她感到虚弱，感到轻飘飘的，这一切都感觉如此……不对劲。_

_Looking around she was in some dark metallic room, not even vaguely resembling anywhere she had seen before in Germany or Japan. It was a rather small room, with any available space around her being taken up by stacked boxes held in place by cargo netting. What little lighting was available came from a dim red bulb, giving her just enough light to make out bits and pieces of the room.  
环顾四周，她身处一个昏暗的金属房间，与她在德国或日本见过的任何地方都大相径庭。这是一个相当狭小的房间，四周可用的空间都被堆放的箱子占据，箱子由货物网固定。仅有的照明来自一盏昏暗的红灯，勉强让她能辨认出房间的零星细节。_

_Glancing down to herself, she noted the straps holding down her body, they weren't tight at all, instead, just enough to keep her in place on the hospital bed she found herself on. Around the bed, the red hue of runes from sealing pillars stood, she'd never actually seen one in person, only been taught how to identify them in training.  
她低头看向自己，注意到固定身体的带子并不紧绷，只是刚好让她保持在所处的医院床上。床周围，封印柱上的红色符文闪烁着，她从未亲眼见过实物，只在训练中学习过如何识别它们。_

_Asuka tried to bring her right hand up to her face, to try to feel what was blocking half her vision, but it too felt incredibly weak, so weak that it was a challenge to raise it in the first place, and instantly she saw why.  
明日香试图抬起右手摸向自己的脸，想弄清楚是什么遮挡了她一半的视线，但她的手也异常无力，连抬起都显得十分困难，她立刻明白了原因。_

_It was like looking at a skeleton's hand, the skin seemed to be pulled tight against her bones, it was as if there was no flesh under her skin. Each movement allowed her to witness the tensioning of muscle just under the skin in a grotesque manner. The IV that dug into her arm was repugnant as well, the needle clearly visible as a lump under her skin.  
那手就像骷髅一般，皮肤紧贴着骨头，仿佛皮下没有一丝肉。每一次动作都让她能目睹皮肤下肌肉的扭曲张力，显得异常怪异。插在手臂上的静脉注射针也令人厌恶，针头在皮肤下清晰可见，形成一个肿块。_

_Despite the horrific sight before her, the presence of something else drew her attention.  
尽管眼前景象骇人，但某种其他的存在吸引了她的注意。_

_Wrapped in her fingers, now dangling there in the air, a pendant in the shape of a Greek cross hung suspended for her to see.  
她指间缠绕着一枚希腊十字形状的吊坠，此刻正悬在空中，供她细细端详。_

_She stared at it, confused for a moment, but the red stain on it told her who's it was and the memory of what had happened between them the night before rushed back to her.  
她凝视着它，一时困惑，但上面的红色污渍告诉了她这是谁的，昨晚他们之间发生的一切记忆如潮水般涌回她的脑海。_

_Instantly she knew he had left that tangled in her fingers for her.  
她立刻明白，他故意留下这缠绕在她指间的痕迹。_

_Shinji. 真嗣。_

_She needed Shinji. 她需要真嗣。_

_Pulling it into her hand, she squeezed it with what little effort she could as she thought of what to do.  
她将它握在手中，用尽自己微薄的力量挤压着，思考着下一步该做什么。_

_Trying to sit up and look around, she struggled with even the most basic of movements, each motion sending shooting pains through her. She labored a few more moments before her hand brushed again something in the bed alongside her.  
她试图坐起来环顾四周，但就连最基本的动作都让她挣扎不已，每一次移动都伴随着剧烈的疼痛。她又努力了一会儿，直到手再次触碰到床边的东西。_

_Pulling it up, Asuka just stared at the nurse call button and despite a brief flurry of hesitation, she let her thumb press it, resounding in a satisfying click.  
阿斯卡将它拉近，盯着那个护士呼叫按钮，尽管有一瞬间的犹豫，她还是用拇指按了下去，发出一声令人满意的咔嗒声。_

_Resting back the girl tried to steady her breathing, as well as the thoughts racing around inside her head. What the hell was going on, why wasn't she in the NERV hospital wing, and why couldn't she move her left side?  
女孩靠在椅背上，试图平复呼吸，同时理清脑海中疾驰的思绪。到底发生了什么，为什么她不在 NERV 的医院病房，而且为什么她的左侧身体动弹不得？_

_That whole train of thought was interrupted by the screeching of metal to her right, rolling her head, the girl's eye stung from the rapid change of light, as a door opened, and someone's head peered inside.  
这一连串的思绪被右侧刺耳的金属摩擦声打断，女孩转过头，眼睛因光线迅速变化而刺痛，一扇门打开，有人探头进来。_

_"Hello?" she asked, only to hear the same raspy voice from before emanate from her throat.  
“喂？”她问道，却听到自己喉咙里传出之前那沙哑的声音。_

_A small squeal was all she was given in response, as the door slammed shut with a resounding clang.  
回应她的只有一声小小的尖叫，紧接着门砰的一声重重关上，发出响亮的撞击声。_

_What was that all about?  
这到底是怎么回事？_

_Asuka decided to press the button a few more times, hoping it would again cause someone to assist her, however in a short while she'd get more than she wished for.  
明日香决定再多按几次按钮，希望能再次有人来帮忙，然而不久后她得到的将远超她的期望。_

_She could hear the clamoring of boots outside, and shortly after, her vision was once more awash in bright light. Instead of staying at the door, a group of people rushed inside, guns drawn.  
她能听到门外靴子杂乱的声响，不久后，她的视线再次被明亮的光线淹没。一群人没有停留在门口，而是冲了进来，枪支已准备就绪。_

_That… hadn't been expected.  
这……完全出乎意料。_

_Despite her repeated attempts at asking questions, Asuka was ignored while being transferred to a wheelchair against her will. It wasn't like she could exactly fight back but with the string of expletives being thrown towards her handlers, she was sure they had gotten the message of her annoyance.  
尽管她一再试图提问，但转移过程中，明日香还是被强行安置在轮椅上，无视她的意愿。她虽然无法反抗，但那一连串的咒骂无疑向她的看护者传达了她不满的情绪。_

_Being wheeled out while under armed guard wasn't exactly something Asuka had been expecting, neither was the fact they were clearly on a ship, the sheer number of times her chair had been picked up and unceremoniously carried over the bottom of the oval doorways made that obvious to her.  
在武装人员的押送下被推出去，这可不是明日香预料中的事，同样出乎她意料的是，他们显然在一艘船上，她的椅子被无数次地抬起，粗鲁地越过那些椭圆形门框的底部，这一点对她来说再明显不过了。_

_Finally, they entered a different room, this one a few times larger than the one she had found herself in earlier, but equally as dim and again filled with cargo. Leaving her IV bag with her, all of the accompanying personnel left the room.  
最终，他们进入了一个不同的房间，这个房间比她之前所在的那个大了几倍，但同样昏暗，同样堆满了货物。他们把她的静脉注射袋留给了她，所有陪同人员都离开了房间。_

_"No, no, stay, we could catch up…" she grumbled to herself as the last one left the room.  
“不，不，别走，我们可以叙叙旧……”她自言自语地咕哝着，直到最后一个人离开房间。_

_She wasn't alone for long, as a flash of light at the far end of the room signaled the arrival of a woman in a short trench coat, followed by someone else, who Asuka couldn't make out as the door closed, once again drowning them in dim lighting.  
她并未独处太久，房间尽头的一道闪光预示着一位身着短款风衣的女性到来，随后还有一人，但随着门再次关闭，昏暗的光线再次笼罩一切，明日香未能看清那人的面容。_

_"Asuka Langely Shikinami?" a voice called out in the darkness.  
“式波·兰格雷·惣流？”黑暗中传来一个声音。_

_She couldn't quite make out if it was familiar or not, but she responded anyway, it wasn't like she was going to escape from here when she could barely raise her hand let alone walk.  
她无法确定那声音是否熟悉，但还是回应了，毕竟在这种连抬手都困难的情况下，她根本不可能逃离这里。_

_"Asuka Langely Shikinami, Second Child, Pilot…" she stopped, she wasn't a pilot anymore, they had taken Unit-02 away from her.  
“惣流·明日香·兰格雷，第二适格者，驾驶员……”她顿住了，她已不再是驾驶员，他们夺走了她的 02 号机。_

_"European Airforce, Rank, Captain." she continued, remembering the training that had been drilled into her.  
“欧洲空军，军衔，上尉。”她继续道，回忆起那些被反复灌输的训练。_

_"She has a continuity of memory, it's a good sign." Another voice said, one that she could barely make out.  
“她的记忆连贯，这是个好迹象。”另一个声音说道，那声音她几乎辨认不出。_

_"Alright, let's start." "好了，我们开始吧。"_

_The rhythmic sound of boots against metal began to cross the room, drawing ever closer. Finally standing at the edge of usable light, Asuka squinted and tried to get more detail before both figures stepped forwards as the room exploded in light.  
靴子敲击金属的节奏声开始在房间内回荡，逐渐逼近。终于，站在可用光线的边缘，明日香眯起眼睛试图捕捉更多细节，随后两人一同迈步，房间瞬间被光芒吞没。_

_Asuka's eye blinked at the familiar faces of Misato Katsuragi and Ritsuko Akagi, but apart from what she could see of their face's little else was the same. Misato was the one wearing a short trench coat, its red color reminiscent of the one Asuka had come to know. Ritsuko on the other hand still wore her lab coat but her hair was the most striking aspect to chain, no longer falling past her ears, instead, it was so short it nearly resembled a buzz cut.  
明日香的眼眸在熟悉的脸庞上闪烁，那是葛城美里和赤木律子，但除了她们的面容，其他一切都已大相径庭。美里穿着一件短款风衣，那红色让她想起了自己熟悉的那件。而律子依旧身着她的白大褂，但最引人注目的是她的头发，不再垂至耳际，而是剪得极短，近乎平头。_

_The girl could barely comprehend the sight before her, these two people she had come to know, why were they so different?  
女孩几乎无法理解眼前的景象，这两个她熟悉的人，为何变得如此不同？_

_"What's the last thing you remember?" the blonde doctor asked bluntly, pulling out something square and looking down into its screen.  
“你记得的最后一件事是什么？”金发医生直截了当地问道，掏出一个方形物体，低头查看屏幕。_

_"Um…" she didn't exactly feel like talking about everything she had witnessed after Unit-03's activation, not that it would make sense to them and there was also the fact that it could have been nothing more than a dream, so she started where Misato herself would know.  
"呃……"她并不想详细谈论自己在三号机启动后所目睹的一切，毕竟这对他们来说可能毫无意义，而且那也可能只是一场梦，所以她从美里自己也知道的地方开始说起。_

_"Unit-03," she started, her voice was less raspy now, still soft, but it was clear, "I was in the elevator, and we were talking, right Misato? After that I was in Unit-03's entry plug…"  
"三号机，"她开始说道，声音不再那么沙哑，依旧柔和，但清晰可辨，"我在电梯里，我们当时在聊天，对吧，美里？之后我就进入了三号机的插入栓……"_

_Both women looked at each other, neither saying a word before Misato spoke up.  
两位女士互相对视，一言不发，直到美里开口。_

_"So, you remember what we talked about?" she asked.  
"那么，你还记得我们谈过的事情吗？" 她问道。_

_Asuka eyed the doctor, she wasn't exactly someone the girl wanted to discuss any of those feelings with, but she could work around them.  
明日香打量着医生，她并不是那个女孩愿意讨论这些情感的对象，但她可以绕过这些。_

_"Yes," she answered, not bothering to go into detail, but she wanted answers too "What happened? Where's Shinji… and Wondergirl?"  
“是的，”她回答道，没有细说，但她同样渴望答案，“发生了什么？真嗣在哪儿……还有明日香呢？”_

_Misato crossed her arms, frowning, she just eyed Ritsuko again, before continuing.  
美里交叉双臂，皱着眉头，再次盯着律子，然后继续说道。_

_"Actually, we'd like to know about your relationship with Shinji Ikari."  
“实际上，我们想了解一下你和真嗣的关系。”_

_The redhead's heart pounded in her chest, why was she bringing this up? If she asked that blunt of a question that meant she told Ritsuko and…  
红发女子的心在胸腔中狂跳，她为什么要提起这个？如果她问得如此直白，那就意味着她已经告诉了律子，而且……_

_Suddenly the girl squirmed in her seat as anger bubbled up in her, she had told someone else! Asuka thought she could trust her!  
突然间，女孩在座位上扭动起来，怒火在她心中翻腾，她竟然告诉了别人！明日香以为自己可以信任她的！_

_"What about it?" she growled at the woman, not that it was very intimidating due to the state of her voice.  
“那又怎样？”她对着女人咆哮，尽管由于声音的状态，这并不怎么吓人。_

_Misato sighed, before marching over to Ritsuko and motioning for the device in her hands.  
美里叹了口气，然后大步走向律子，示意她手中的设备。_

_"Because Shinji Ikari lied to all of us."  
"因为碇真嗣对我们所有人都撒了谎。"_

_"What are you talking about? Shinji never lied to me!" Asuka barked.  
"你在说什么？真嗣从未对我撒过谎！" 明日香厉声说道。"_

_Misato looked down over the device she was carrying, touching it and swiping, before setting it down on the girl's lap.  
美里低头看着她手中的设备，触摸并滑动了几下，然后将其放在女孩的膝上。_

_"That was recorded during the Third Child's last fight in an Evangelion," Misato said, as she tapped the screen causing a video to play.  
“这是在第三适格者最后一次驾驶 EVA 时录下的，”美里说着，轻敲屏幕，播放了一段视频。_

_Asuka watched the scene unfold, Unit-01, with its armor trashed and green accents turned to red. The Unit's left forearm glowed as it marched towards the Angel which was resting in the Geofront, while a halo formed above the EVA's head.  
明日香注视着这一幕，零一机甲破损，绿色装饰转为红色。零一的左前臂闪耀着光芒，向着躺在地底空间的使徒迈进，同时 EVA 头顶形成了一个光环。_

_It was incomprehensible to the girl, as Unit-01 grabbed the Angel, and began to rise up into the air, its body morphing and radiating out vertical pillars of light, while massive crimson rings formed above its head.  
对少女来说，这一切难以理解，零一抓住使徒，开始升空，身体变形并放射出垂直的光柱，巨大的深红圆环在其头顶形成。_

_Finally, the video cut off, leaving the girl looking to Misato for answers.  
终于，视频中断了，女孩转向美里寻求答案。_

_"What you just witnessed, was the beginning of what is known as the Near Third Impact,"  
“你刚才所看到的，是所谓的近第三次冲击的开始，”_

_"Near Third Impact?" Asuka said quietly to herself,  
“近第三次冲击？”明日香低声自语，_

_"Since then, we've learned that Gendo Ikari was working to see a Third Impact brought about, under the name 'the Human Instrumentality Project'."  
自那时起，我们得知碇源堂正致力于实现名为“人类补完计划”的第三次冲击。_

_"The commander?" Asuka asked "Well then where are we? Who's running NERV?"  
“指挥官？”明日香问道，“那么我们现在在哪儿？谁在管理 NERV？”_

_"This is not NERV. Currently you're on the supercarrier known as_ Over the Rainbow. W_e are WILLE, formed to prevent NERV's goal of human instrumentality."_  
这里不是 NERV。你现在位于名为‘彩虹之上’的超航母上。我们是 WILLE，成立的目的就是为了阻止 NERV 实现人类补完计划。

_Asuka said nothing, just looking down at the final frame of the video, the image of Unit-01 washing in red light searing itself into her eye. The screen shut off, leaving only a black mirror to reflect the image of a girl staring back at her.  
明日香一言不发，只是低头凝视着视频的最后一帧，初号机在红光中浮现的画面深深烙印在她的眼中。屏幕熄灭，只留下一面黑色的镜子，映照出一个女孩凝视着自己的影像。_

_Half her face was covered in gauze, with red runes strewn over it. What she could see of the once beautiful girl that she had scene in the mirror for years was in disarray, her hair was long and unkempt, hanging down multitudes longer than she had ever let if grow out, her cheeks had sunken, and the skin had been pulled tight against the bones leaving her looking beyond malnourished. Finally, along her left cheek as scar ran down to her throat and beyond.  
她半边脸被纱布覆盖，上面散布着红色的符文。曾经在镜中见过多年的美丽少女，如今已面目全非，头发凌乱不堪，长度远超她以往所留，面颊凹陷，皮肤紧贴骨骼，显得极度营养不良。最后，沿着她的左脸颊，一道疤痕延伸至喉咙乃至更远。_

_And yet, even looking at that face, she couldn't even bare to pity herself. The girl's mind was left only to wonder about one thing, about_ him  
然而，即便凝视着那张脸，她连自怜的勇气都荡然无存。女孩的思绪只能停留在一件事上，关于他。_._

_"Where is he?" she asked, "Where is Shinji?"  
“他在哪儿？”她问道，“真嗣在哪儿？”_

_"We now know that the Third Child knew of his father's plans, that he even spoke openly about his knowledge as well as knowing about the organization behind his father." Misato said, ignoring her question, "So now we'd like to know if he said anything to you about this and your relationship with him."  
“我们现在知道，第三适格者了解他父亲的计划，他甚至公开谈论过这些知识，以及他父亲背后的组织。”美里无视她的问题，继续说道，“所以我们想知道，他是否对你透露过这些，以及你们之间的关系。”_

_For a moment, those eyes bore into her, that cold look contradicted everything she knew about the woman. Where was the Misato that had warmly taken her in? Where was the woman who seemed to always put up with her and who's voice had reassured her before entering Unit-03?  
有那么一刻，那双眼睛深深地凝视着她，那冰冷的眼神与她所了解的千鹤截然相反。那个热情接纳她的美里在哪里？那个似乎总是包容她、声音曾在她进入三号机前给予安慰的女人又在哪里？_

_"I'll tell you if I damn well please! I don't give a shit about what he knew, he never said anything to me!" Asuka yelled the best she could. It didn't matter if she what she said was only half true. Asuka did care, she would make sure to get the truth out of him when she saw him, there was now question about that. Why didn't he tell her the truth? What else didn't he tell her?  
"我高兴说就说！我才不在乎他知道什么，他从来没跟我说过！" 明日香尽可能大声地喊道。她的话是否只有一半是真的并不重要。明日香确实在乎，她会确保下次见到他时逼出真相，这一点毋庸置疑。为什么他不告诉她真相？他还隐瞒了什么？  
_

_Had anything been real? 曾经有任何东西是真实的吗？_

_"And you didn't answer my question, where is Shinji!?".  
“你还没回答我的问题，真嗣在哪里？！”_

_Misato said nothing, instead, Ritsuko spoke up.  
美里一言不发，反而是律子开口了。_

_"After Unit-01 was forced into a dormant state, we were able to reestablish the video feed inside Unit-01…." her voice stopped as the creeping realization forced itself into the girl's mind.  
"在初号机被强制进入休眠状态后，我们得以重新建立初号机内部的视频信号……" 她的声音戛然而止，一种逐渐蔓延的认知强行闯入了女孩的脑海。_

_"There was nothing there, the entry plug was empty, our best theory is that he was absorbed into the core, at that was left was his plug suit."  
"那里空无一物，驾驶舱是空的，我们最好的推测是他被吸收进了核心，剩下的只有他的驾驶服。"_

_"So why not get him back out?!" She shouted, "Don't you have any kind of procedure for this?"  
"那为什么不把他救出来？！" 她喊道，"你们难道没有任何应对这种情况的程序吗？"_

_"Asuka…"  "明日香……"_

_"NO! We have to try and get him out, we…"  
"不！我们必须设法把他救出来，我们……"_

_"Asuka!" Misato shouted cutting her off, "That not possible now, it wasn't even possible then…"  
"明日香！" 美里喊道，打断了她，"现在不可能了，那时候也不可能……"_

_"What do you mean 'then'?" the girl asked, a pit developing in her stomach.  
"你说的'那时候'是什么意思？" 女孩问道，心中涌起一股不安。_

_Both women looked at each other before Misato took a deep breath, leaning over and taking the device off the girl's lap.  
两位女士对视了一眼，随后美里深吸一口气，俯身将设备从女孩的膝上取下。_

_"It's been a while since then Asuka, you've been asleep, and the world's changed."  
“那之后已经过去很久了，明日香，你一直在沉睡，世界也变了。”_

_Asuka's mind raced as fast as her heart and could only think back to the image of destruction she had just scene.  
明日香的心跳如鼓，思绪飞转，脑海中只回荡着刚刚目睹的毁灭景象。_

_"How long?!"  "多久？！"_

_Neither said anything at first, probably daring the other to answer so they wouldn't have to.  
两人一开始都没有说话，大概是在互相挑衅，看谁先回答，这样自己就不用开口了。_

_"I ASKED HOW LONG!?" "我问多久了！？"_

_"You've been asleep for four years Asuka."  
"你已经沉睡了四年，明日香。"_

_At that moment the Second Child could only process two things.  
那一刻，二号适格者只能理解两件事。_

_Shinji had lied to her.  
真嗣对她撒了谎。_

_And she was alone again.  
她又独自一人了。_

ʡʘʘʘʢ

Standing in front of that door, the girl took a breath and pushed down those painful memories.  
站在那扇门前，女孩深吸一口气，压下了那些痛苦的记忆。

Looking to her left, the blank silhouette of a small child stood there, visible only to the pupil currently under her eyepatch. It did nothing, just stood there and looked at her while that eye stung and she worked up the courage to face him again.  
她向左看去，一个空白的小孩轮廓站在那里，只有她眼罩下的瞳孔才能看见。它什么也没做，只是站在那里看着她，那只眼睛刺痛着，她鼓起勇气再次面对他。

Taking a deep breath, she would get the answers she so desperately needed, for the first time they were within her grasp. After years of finally accepting that she might never know, now was the time.  
深吸一口气，她将得到那些她迫切需要的答案，这是第一次，它们近在咫尺。经过多年终于接受自己可能永远无法知晓的事实后，现在正是时候。

Opening the door, she couldn't have know how unprepared she was for the answers that awaited her.  
推开门的那一刻，她未曾料到自己对即将揭晓的答案竟如此毫无准备。

**Kept you waiting huh?  让你久等了吧？**

**So yes, the next chapter is the fabled meeting, I know I'm late in getting this to you so that means swift next chapter… hopefully. Anyways, I thought it would have been nice to see Asuka waking up even in canon 3.0, would have been cool to see and contrast how she woke up to a changed world after 2.0.  
所以没错，接下来的chapter就是传说中的会面，我知道我迟交了，所以这意味着要迅速进入下一个chapter……希望如此。无论如何，我觉得能在正史 3.0 中看到明日香醒来会很好，对比她在 2.0 后醒来面对一个变化的世界，那一定很酷。**

**SHOUTOUTS! 特别鸣谢！**

**IkeaisOP – Thanks! I feel that late-night reading haha.  
IkeaisOP – 谢谢！感觉像是深夜阅读哈哈。**

**MooseTracks101 – And more you shall have!  
MooseTracks101 – 更多精彩，敬请期待！**

**Berix – Yeah, kinda wanted to take a middle road on Shikinami's attitude, she's pissed, but wants answers more than anything, plus this whole chapter was meant to get us up to speed on how they view Shinji, who probably shouldn't have just kinda hinted stuff to Kaji, big oops.  
Berix – 嗯，有点想在式波的态度上走中间路线，她很生气，但更想要答案，而且这个chapter是为了让我们了解他们如何看待真嗣，他可能不应该只是向加持暗示一些事情，大失误。**

**gyugya16 – I think you're referring to a mistake, Mistao did not call Shikinami Soryu, it's been fixed.  
gyugya16 – 我想你指的是一个错误，Mistao 并没有称呼式波为惣流，已经修正了。**

**NoseGum – Ah yeah, that encouragement is gonna come back.  
NoseGum – 啊对，那种鼓励会回来的。**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – Oh… trolling… haha, 'Rits you are fucking my father.'  
美利坚超旋风 – 哦……捣乱呢……哈哈，'Rits 你这是在搞我爸啊。'**

**Lupeskillz – Thanks! Lupeskillz – 谢谢！**

**YodaMorpheus7 – Hmmm, *scribbles down 'get Misato a pony'  
尤达墨菲斯 7 – 嗯，*记下'给美里弄匹小马'**

**kempn200252 – SHHHHHH! Don't tell them that! (2) Yeah that came to mind, but why didn't that happen with Rei getting absorbed? Is Unit-01 based off Lilith in Rebuilds? Then we have 3.0 and Unit-13's ascension, so it's just a mess, which is being sorted though haha. (I can explain this lore dammit!)  
肯普 200252 – 嘘！别告诉他们！(2) 是啊，这个我也有想到，但为什么雷吸收丽的时候没发生这种情况？新剧场版里的初号机是基于莉莉丝造的吗？然后我们还有 3.0 和 13 号机的升天，所以这真是一团乱，不过正在理清呢哈哈。（我他妈能解释这设定！）**

**Akomis – Thanks! Akomis – 谢谢！**

**s1ckb0y – Very sus. s1ckb0y – 非常可疑。**

**dyinglittelstar – "For MAGI answers please refer to Chapter 1" lmao, thought that was just an abandoned concept? I was gonna have the MAGI run Wunder anyways, Anno just decided to make it canon.  
dyinglittelstar – “关于 MAGI 的答案请参考《一千零一夜》1”哈哈，以为那只是个被抛弃的概念吗？我本来就打算让 MAGI 运行 Wunder，只是庵野秀明决定让它成为正统设定。**

**EvaPilotFair – Shinji out here just becoming Agent 47 and donning peoples outfits.  
EvaPilotFair – 真嗣在这里简直就是变成了特工 47，还穿上了别人的衣服。**

**ThyDevoiutBeliever – I guess that's a good thing?  
ThyDevoiutBeliever – 我想那应该是件好事吧？**

**Guest (1) – Ten. Guest (1) – 十分。**

**calborghete – Happy? Is Misato in 3.0 ever happy?  
calborghete – 快乐？在 3.0 中的美里有过快乐吗？**

**tomdj1701 – Ah yes, alright haha. and… perhaps.  
tomdj1701 – 啊是的，好吧哈哈。而且……或许吧。**

**SheriffJohnStone – A lot to say after ten.  
SheriffJohnStone – 十点后有很多话要说。**

**Shredjeep777 – CH39 definitely is one of my favorites too, thanks!  
Shredjeep777 – CH39 绝对也是我的最爱之一，谢谢！**

**JIM D. ZAS – Thanks!  
JIM D. ZAS – 谢谢！**

**JDH1080 – Thanks! JDH1080 – 谢谢！**

**KingZanaduu – Ten years, but we are close.  
KingZanaduu – 十年相伴，情谊深厚。**

**Iraki01 – Ten years, but I think Misato is actually gonna be a bit different, especially when the truth comes out.  
Iraki01 – 十年过去了，但我觉得美里实际上会有所不同，尤其是在真相大白之后。**

**skyf0x – Hopefully we can make Misato feel a bit more understandable, and under that hard exterior she's just hurting from the loss of her 'son', followed by his 'betrayal', so I'd giver her some leeway. Its been a rough ten years. Her treatment of Asuka tho? Inexcusable, especially after their final conversation before Unit-03, how she almost started to become something more than a guardian, like she had with Shinji, only to recoil or…. relapse, into her old cold habits.  
skyf0x – 希望我们能让美里显得更易理解些，她那坚硬的外表下，只是因为失去了她的‘儿子’，随后又经历了他的‘背叛’，所以我会给她一些宽容。这十年对她来说确实不易。但她对明日香的态度呢？不可原谅，尤其是在三号机事件前他们的最后一次谈话，她几乎开始超越一个监护人的角色，就像她曾经对真嗣那样，结果却退缩了，或者……又回到了她那冷漠的老习惯中。**

**GeHirNunDherZ – We'll see what happens.  
GeHirNunDherZ – 我们拭目以待。**

**fonte20nit – *Doom's 'The Only Thing They Fear is You' starts playing as Asuka prepares to reenact the hallway scene from Rogue One.  
fonte20nit – *《毁灭战士》的《The Only Thing They Fear is You》响起，随着明日香准备重现《侠盗一号》中的走廊场景。**

**engel17white – Thanks, some of those predictions are true, some are false, I'll let you discover which is which.  
engel17white – 谢谢，有些预测是准确的，有些则是错误的，我会让你自己去发现哪些是哪些。**

**Alright something to clear up. Misato did not call Shikinami Soryu last chapter, my intoxicated brain decided not to realize that so it has been changed, that's on me. Also, 10 years in the total timeskip, not 14, Asuka's been asleep for 4 as we saw in this chapter, and last chapter it's stated by Ritsuko that 'the MAGI are behaving just like ten years ago'. So, there we have it. Next chapter should be here in a day or three, keeping them pretty close this time  
好吧，有些事情需要澄清。美里并没有称呼式波·明日香·兰格雷为chapter，我醉酒的大脑决定不去意识到这一点，所以已经进行了修改，这是我的责任。另外，总的时间跳跃是 10 年，不是 14 年，正如我们在chapter中所见，明日香已经沉睡了 4 年，而在chapter中，由律子指出‘MAGI 的行为就像十年前一样’。所以，就是这样。下一章chapter应该在一两天内更新，这次会保持较近的间隔。**

**Until Next TIme 直到下次**


### Chapter 45: "…We left as Inmates from an Asylum…"  
Chapter 45: "…我们如同从疯人院逃出的囚犯…"

The boy had to admit, this chair was really uncomfortable.  
男孩不得不承认，这椅子真的很不舒服。

He had practically been thrown into this interrogation room by the posse of guards that had cuffed him in the hallway. They were kind enough to take off the cuffs once he was here, but it wasn't much of a reassuring gesture, they also let him keep the flight suit, which was nice, granted they took everything else, even the shoes.  
他几乎是被一队警卫在走廊里铐住后扔进这间审讯室的。他们还算仁慈，一到这里就解开了手铐，但这并不怎么让人安心，他们还让他保留了飞行服，这倒是不错，尽管他们拿走了其他所有东西，甚至连鞋子都没留下。

Deciding he wasn't going to sit, he instead began to pace slowly, just looking past the glass panel that separated the room, there was no one there, but the desk told him eventually they'd interrogate him. At least if he was lucky.  
他决定不坐下，而是开始缓慢地踱步，只是透过分隔房间的玻璃面板向外看，那里空无一人，但桌子告诉他，最终他们会来审问他。至少如果他幸运的话。

Turning back to the door he had come through, his eyes widened at the two figures now standing there, both clad in a red and blue plug suit respectively.  
他转身看向自己进来的那扇门，只见两个身影现在正站在那里，分别穿着红色和蓝色的插头服。

"_Oh, this is just great, the three of us back together again!" Soryu shouted, throwing her hands up, realizing that the clone was now here._  
"哦，真是太好了，我们三个又聚在一起了！" 惣流喊道，双手一挥，意识到那个克隆体现在也在这里。

"_I," Rei started, before eyeing both of them, her gaze lingering on Soryu's bandages "What is happening?"_  
"我，" 丽开始说，然后打量着她们两个，目光在惣流的绷带上停留了一会儿，"这是怎么回事？"

"_If you don't know, maybe you shouldn't run off next time!" the redhead exploded, as she now began to pace._  
"如果你不知道，下次就别再擅自跑掉了！" 红发女孩爆发了，开始来回踱步。

"Ayanami?" Shinji asked, drawing the girl's attention "You can see her too?"  
"绫波？" 真嗣问道，吸引了女孩的注意 "你也能看见她吗？"

"_Yes… where are we?"_ "是的…我们在哪里？"

"What's the last thing you remember?" Shinji asked ignoring the question.  
"你记得的最后一件事是什么？" 真嗣避开了问题问道。"

"_The Tenth Angel… someone else was piloting Unit-02… I saved them…" her eyes were still fixed on Asuka, unsure of what she was really seeing "Pilot Shikinami?" she asked._  
"第十使徒……是别人在驾驶二号机……我救了他们……" 她的目光依旧紧锁在明日香身上，不确定自己真正看到的是什么，"式波驾驶员？" 她问道。

"_Great, she's not even our Rei, she's the one that wants to make dinner for everyone!" the redhead groaned, stomping around the room._  
"太好了，她甚至不是我们的绫波，她是那个想给大家做饭的！" 红发女孩抱怨着，在房间里跺脚走来走去。

"Well, welcome to the party, hope you enjoy the stay," Shinji said.  
"那么，欢迎加入派对，希望你在这里过得愉快，" 真嗣说道。

"_I still do not understand," Rei said, confused_  
"我还是不明白，" 丽说，感到困惑

"_Yeah, join the club, just sit back and watch the train wreck."_  
"是啊，加入我们吧，坐下来欣赏这场灾难。"

Shinji pinched the bridge of his nose; it was bad enough having one invisible companion. Now he had two, and to make it worse, he'd have to deal with their constant bickering.  
真嗣捏了捏鼻梁；有一个看不见的同伴已经够糟糕了。现在他有两个，更糟糕的是，他还得应付他们无休止的争吵。

"_You… know about me…" she said slowly, like she was trying to process some new information._  
"你…了解我…" 她缓缓说道，仿佛在努力消化一些新信息。

"What was that?" Shinji asked, unsure of what she had just said.  
"那是什么？" 真嗣问道，不确定她刚刚说了什么。

"_Me… the Ayanami Series… you know about my purpose." She stated._  
"我… 绫波系列… 你知道我的使命。" 她陈述道。

"_Well duh, Wondergirl you really need to get with the program here!"_  
"哎呀，神奇女孩，你真的得跟上节奏了！"

"How do you know that?" Shinji asked ignoring the redhead.  
"你怎么知道的？" 真嗣问道，忽略了红发女孩。

"_I'm not sure… am I seeing your memories?"_  
"我不确定……我是在看你的记忆吗？"

"_Oh, you really don't want to be digging through those," Soryu mumbled before walking up to the First Child and examining her. "Third, when you took that plunge into the core, to get her, do you think you brought her back?" she asked calmly._  
“哦，你真的不想去翻那些东西，”索留低声说道，然后走向初号机驾驶员，仔细打量着她。“三号，当你跳进核心去救她时，你觉得你把她带回来了吗？”她平静地问道。

Shinji rubbed his eyes, he really wished that wasn't the case, he didn't need this right now.  
真嗣揉了揉眼睛，他真希望事实并非如此，他现在不需要这个。

Unfortunately, the door swung open, ending their little group chat and revealing a set of guards eyeing him, seemingly daring him to try and rush out. Shinji instead just ended up leaning against the glass at the other end of the room, he really didn't need to rile them up.  
不幸的是，门突然打开，结束了他们的小组聊天，一队守卫盯着他，似乎在挑衅他试图冲出去。真嗣最终只是靠在房间另一端的玻璃上，他真的不想激怒他们。

Upon realizing their prisoner wasn't about to try to escape, both stepped aside, letting a familiar-looking brunette walk in.  
意识到他们的囚犯并不打算逃跑，两人都退到一旁，让一个看起来很眼熟的棕发女子走了进来。

She'd seen better days, of course, last time he'd seen the girl she and everyone was being tossed around the bridge. Her left arm was currently in a sling and as she walked in, she placed her beret back on her head, trying in vain to hide the gauze currently wrapped around it.  
她当然有过更好的时光，上次他见到这女孩时，她和所有人都在舰桥上被甩来甩去。她的左臂现在吊着吊带，当她走进来时，她把贝雷帽重新戴回头上，试图徒劳地掩盖缠在头上的纱布。

"Subject BM-03," she said, pulling a clipboard from under her arm, "tentative name, Shinji Ikari…." The boy could clearly tell she was in discomfort, just the wincing from putting her small bag down told him that her shoulder had probably been dislocated.  
“对象 BM-03，”她从腋下抽出一块写字板说道，“暂定名为，碇真嗣……”少年明显看出她有些不适，仅是放下小包时的一丝皱眉，便让他猜到她的肩膀可能脱臼了。

"It's Shinji," he stated, he wasn't about to be reduced to a designation, 'Third Children' was close enough already.  
"是真嗣," 他声明道，他可不想被简化为一个代号，'第三适格者'已经够接近了。

"Shinji," she said clearing her throat, she had stayed away from him, closer to the door and against the opposite wall from him. By the way she was eyeing him, he could tell she was scared, at the very least nervous. "The vice-captain will be in shortly to speak."  
"真嗣," 她清了清嗓子说道，她一直远离他，靠近门口，与他相对的墙边。从她打量他的眼神来看，他可以判断出她在害怕，至少是紧张。"副队长很快就会进来和你谈话。"

Having said that she rummaged through her bag and cautiously made her way over to him, a blood pressure cuff in her good hand.  
说完这些，她翻找着她的包，小心翼翼地向他走去，一只手拿着血压计。

"May I see your arm?" she asked, as she made her way up to him.  
“可以看看你的手臂吗？”她边说边向他走去。

"_Oh, Ikari, looks like you got a new girlfriend huh?" Soryu taunted as she examined the girl._  
“哦，碇，看来你交了个新女朋友啊？”惣流嘲讽道，同时打量着那个女孩。

Considering the girl hadn't done anything to him, Shinji decided he could at least help her do her job. It wasn't his fault she was hurt, but he didn't exactly want to make her life hell by making this difficult.  
考虑到这个女孩并没有对他做什么，真嗣决定至少可以帮助她完成工作。她受伤并非他的错，但他也不想因为让事情变得困难而使她的生活更加糟糕。

"Here, let me do that." He said, realizing just how hard of a time she would have with only one good arm.  
"来，我来帮你。" 他说道，意识到她只有一只好手会多么不便。

She gingerly held it out to him, much to his amusement, while he decided it would be easier to just sit down to do this. Taking a seat, he wrapped it around his upper arm and let her take a reading.  
她小心翼翼地递给他，这让他觉得颇为有趣，而他决定坐下来做这件事会更方便。他坐下后，将它缠绕在上臂，让她可以读取数据。

"Listen, I'm not going to hurt you," he started, making her jump which elicited a small smile, "relax, it's not like I'm going anywhere this time." He joked.  
"听着，我不会伤害你的，" 他开口道，她被吓了一跳，这让他微微一笑，"放松，这次我可不会跑掉。" 他开玩笑说。

Time seemed to pass so slowly, as the girl finished her tasks and went back to the door, still wary of the boy. Before the door on the opposite side of the glass opened.  
时间似乎流逝得异常缓慢，女孩完成了她的任务，回到门前，依旧对那男孩保持警惕。直到对面那扇玻璃门缓缓开启。

ʡʘʘʘʢ

Misato stared at the screen, unable to tear her eyes away from the boy she had thought long since dead.  
美里凝视着屏幕，无法将视线从那个她以为早已逝去的男孩身上移开。

He just sat there, in a way he reminded Misato of footage she had seen of herself after she was recovered from the Second Impact. It was a sharp contrast to the sight she had just seen a few moments earlier, how he had been almost lively with his attending medic.  
他就那样坐着，那种姿态让美里想起了自己在第二次冲击后被救出时的录像。与几分钟前他几乎活泼地与随行医护人员互动的情景形成了鲜明对比。

Earlier still, she had viewed him talking to air, pacing around the room, and stopping periodically to chat to something invisible.  
更早之前，她曾见他对着空气说话，在房间里来回踱步，时不时停下来与某个看不见的东西交谈。

Now it was as if he had just deflated like there was no energy in the boy anymore. It was all just so… confounding.  
现在他仿佛一下子泄了气，那男孩身上似乎再无半点活力。这一切都太令人费解了。

"Any Ideas?" the captain asked the blonde-haired scientist next to her as they stood just outside the interrogation room.  
“有什么想法吗？”队长问身旁的金发科学家，他们正站在审讯室外。

"No." Ritsuko shook her head before stubbing out a cigarette, a rare sight these days. The captain was sure every time she had disappeared over the last few days it was to light up another one from her dwindling stash.  
"不行。" 律子摇了摇头，随后掐灭了一支香烟，这在如今已属罕见。舰长确信，每当她这几天消失不见，定是去点燃了另一支她所剩无几的存货。

Smoking was a luxury few had in this shattered world.  
在这个支离破碎的世界里，吸烟成了少数人的奢侈享受。

"You know Asuka will force her way in here." the blonde stated, "We should wait, if we go in together, it might help…."  
"你知道明日香会强行闯进来的。" 金发女子陈述道，"我们应该等待，如果我们一起进去，或许会有所帮助……"

"No." Misato said bluntly, "We need to get this over with."  
“不。”美里直截了当地说，“我们得赶紧把这事办完。”

Ritsuko just sighed, there was no reason to argue with the woman, she had long since given up throwing herself against the walls her old friend had thrown up around herself.  
律子只是叹了口气，没有理由与这个女人争论，她早已放弃了自己去撞击老朋友在她周围筑起的墙。

With a pneumatic hiss, the two women entered the opposite room, divided by a pane of glass.  
随着一声气动嘶响，两位女士进入了由一块玻璃隔开的对面房间。

This was the only time they had to use this interrogation room and the dust accumulating on their provided chairs was a testament to that.  
这是他们唯一一次使用这间审讯室，椅子上积聚的灰尘便是这一事实的明证。

Ritsuko placed her laptop down on the dust to their left, while Misato walked up to the glass.  
理津子将笔记本电脑放在左侧的尘土上，而美里则走向了玻璃窗。

Looking down at the boy she was brought back to their first meeting, how timid and introverted he had been, then his seemingly miraculous transformation into the boy who had piloted the EVAs with such confidence. How he had become more than just some boy she was watching over.  
低头凝视着那个男孩，她回想起他们的初次相遇，他曾是那么羞涩内向，随后仿佛奇迹般地转变为那个以无比自信驾驭 EVA 的少年。他已不再是她所看护的普通男孩，而是成长为了一个超越她预期的存在。

And despite the 10 years, it had been since she had seen his face, it hurt just to look at him.  
尽管距离她上次见到他的面容已过去十年，光是看着他依然令她心痛。

"Are you Shinji Ikari?" “你是碇真嗣吗？”

Taking off her glasses, she couldn't help but admit she wanted him to answer 'No'.  
她摘下眼镜，忍不住承认自己希望他回答‘不是’。

ʡʘʘʘʢ

Shinji looked up as the two women entered the room. Noting just how different they were in this life.  
碇真嗣抬头看着两位女士走进房间。注意到这一世她们是多么的不同。

Misato, clad in that trench coat he had seen her in on the bridge, with a hat and glasses which obscured her face.  
美里身穿他在舰桥上见过的那件风衣，头戴帽子，鼻梁上架着眼镜，遮住了她的面容。

Ritsuko's hair was the most striking thing about her, or the lack thereof. It had been cut so short he really didn't know what to think about it, maybe the scientist had finally cracked.  
律子的头发是她最引人注目的特征，或者说，是她的头发缺失。她的头发剪得如此之短，他真的不知道该怎么想，也许这位科学家终于崩溃了。

"Are you Shinji Ikari?" “你是碇真嗣吗？”

Shinji watched as Misato pulled down her goggles, for the first time he could see her eyes. Those brown orbs examined him, critiquing each and every movement he made. More than that, they were so incredibly tired, so incomprehensibly exhausted, he never thought he would see them worn by another person…  
真嗣注视着美里拉下护目镜，这是他第一次能看清她的眼睛。那双棕色的眼眸审视着他，对他的每一个动作都进行着评判。不仅如此，那双眼眸还显得无比疲惫，难以言喻的倦怠，他从未想过会看到另一个人眼中流露出这样的神情……

After all, he had only seen those eyes staring back at him in the mirror.  
毕竟，他只在镜中看到过那样的眼神回望着自己。

Shinji, however, said nothing, just watching her again. He didn't exactly know what WILLE was, nor did he know what kind of Misato this woman would be. It could be that this was simply NERV by another name, or having been through that last world, there would be no resemblance to his original life going forwards.  
然而，真嗣什么也没说，只是再次注视着她。他并不完全了解 WILLE 是什么，也不知道这个女人会是怎样的美里。这可能只是换了个名字的 NERV，或者经历了那个末日世界后，从此与他原本的生活再无相似之处。

In any case, he decided to shut his mouth and just listen for a bit.  
无论如何，他决定闭上嘴，先听一会儿。

"_Is that the best course of action?" he heard the small voice of Rei behind him._  
“那是最好的行动方案吗？”他听到背后丽的小声询问。

"_Wondergirl, shut up!"_ “小丫头，闭嘴！”

The woman said nothing, taking another moment to examine him, before turning and motioning for the blonde to begin as a massive image appeared projected on the glass in front of him.  
那女人一言不发，又打量了他片刻，随后转身示意金发女子开始，与此同时，一个巨大的影像投射在他面前的玻璃上。

"Unit-01 is being utilized as the main engine for this ship, which is why there was nothing for you to do earlier before your… escape," she explained.  
“初号机被用作这艘船的主引擎，这就是为什么你之前无事可做，直到你……逃离，”她解释道。

So, Unit-01 exists…. 所以，初号机真的存在……

"Apart from that, your deep synchronization test results have come in, and your sync rate is zero percent," she continued, "even if you did board an EVA, it wouldn't activate."  
“除此之外，你的深度同步测试结果已经出来了，同步率为零，”她继续说道，“即使你登上 EVA，它也不会启动。”

At that, Shinji couldn't contain himself, a small chuckle escaped him.  
听到这里，真嗣忍不住笑出了声。

That had to be the best joke he had heard in a long time.  
这肯定是他很久以来听过的最好笑的笑话了。

Finally containing himself, he just looked past the projection and at the two women, who were now sporting confused looks on their faces.  
终于控制住自己，他只是越过投影看向那两位女士，她们此刻脸上正带着困惑的表情。

"You have no idea, do you?" he said as the joke that only he knew caused him to chuckle for a few more moments.  
“你们完全不知道，对吧？”他说道，那个只有他自己知道的笑话让他又笑了好一会儿。

Finally calming himself, he straightened back in his chair again "I keep telling you people sync rates aren't everything, but nobody listens."  
最终平静下来，他重新挺直身子坐在椅子上，“我一直在告诉你们，同步率并不是一切，但没人听。”

"Then perhaps you can tell us exactly how you managed to go into a state of awakening for 12 seconds earlier," Ritsuko said, pulling up blurry images of radiating light. Shinji couldn't make sense of it, perhaps this was the equivalent of Zeruel here? Maybe here he had been spit out of Unit-01's core?  
“那么，或许你能告诉我们，你是如何在前不久进入 12 秒觉醒状态的？”律子说着，调出了模糊的辐射光芒图像。真嗣无法理解，这或许在这里相当于零号机？也许在这里，他是从初号机的核心中被吐出来的？

Just shrugging, Shinji shook his head.  
只是耸了耸肩，真嗣摇了摇头。

"Alright then. To prevent any further activity, we've equipped you with a DSS choker…."  
"好吧。为了防止任何进一步的活动，我们给你配备了一个 DSS 项圈……"

"Yeah, about that." Shinji interrupted her while reaching up to his neck and picking at the metal. He had experience getting them off, ever since the first time he had died to one he made it a priority to learn how to release it. Unfortunately, here it was unlike any before.  
"关于那个。" 真嗣打断了她，同时伸手去摸脖子上的金属环。他有过取下它们的经验，自从第一次死于这种装置后，他就优先学习如何释放它。不幸的是，这里的这个与他之前遇到的任何一种都不同。

"Take it off or just blow it up, I really don't care, but I'm not your dancing monkey, got it?"  
"要么取下来，要么直接炸掉，我真的不在乎，但我不是你的跳舞猴子，明白了吗？"

"_Why would you want that?"_  
"你为什么要那样做？"

"_Alright First, listen up, we're gonna have to set some ground rules." Soryu said behind him, "First off, no talking in the theater!"_  
"好了，首先，听好了，我们得定几条规矩。" 索鲁说，"首先，电影院里不许说话！"

"Will you two shut up!" he hissed, turning around to them, and startling the medic next to him.  
"你们俩能不能安静点！" 他低声呵斥，转过身来，吓到了旁边的医疗兵。"

It didn't matter what they knew, if he seemed crazy so be it. Right now, he didn't need the two of them giving him a headache in the middle of this. After all, this world was looking more and more like a write-off.  
他们知道什么并不重要，如果他看起来疯了，那就随它去吧。眼下，他不需要这两个人在这节骨眼上给他添堵。毕竟，这个世界看起来越来越像是要完蛋了。

As the projection died, Shinji turned and was met with the transparent reflection of himself, and the gazes of both women on the other side of the glass.  
随着投影消散，真嗣转身，迎面映入眼帘的是自己透明的倒影，以及玻璃另一侧两位女性的目光。

"It's… a symbol of our distrust and your punishment as well," Ritsuko said, clearly confused about who he had just spoken to.  
"这是……我们不信任的象征，也是对你的惩罚，" 律子说道，显然不清楚他刚刚是在和谁说话。

"Punishment?" Shinji said standing up and heading towards the glass. "You think this is a punishment?"  
"惩罚？" 真嗣站起身，走向玻璃窗。"你认为这是惩罚吗？"

"Ritsuko, why don't you go ride Gendo Ikari's bologna pony for a bit, while Misato and I talk."  
"律子，你为什么不先去骑一会儿源堂·碇的假想马，让美里和我谈谈。"

Suddenly, there was no noise to be heard in the room. Not even the girl next to him seemed to be breathing.  
突然间，房间里一片寂静，连他身旁的女孩似乎都屏住了呼吸。

"You knew about that?" Misato spoke up, her eyes ablaze.  
“你知道那件事？”美里开口道，眼中闪烁着怒火。

"What, that Ritsuko Akagi has 'extracurricular activities' with my 'father'? Yeah, I do."  
“什么，赤木律子和我‘父亲’有‘课外活动’？没错，我知道。”

Shinji just rubbed his eyes in annoyance, looks like they were about to ply 20 questions after all.  
真嗣只是不耐烦地揉了揉眼睛，看来他们终究是要玩 20 问游戏了。

"And please tell me I'm not some clone, I really don't want to be a clone this time, being like Rei sucks." he bemoaned, "no offense," he added to the invisible girl standing behind him.  
“请告诉我我不是什么克隆人，我真的不想这次再当克隆人了，像丽那样太糟糕了。”他抱怨道，“无意冒犯，”他对着站在他身后的隐形女孩补充道。

"You know about the Ayanami Series?" Misato asked, disbelief in her voice.  
“你知道绫波系列吗？”美里问道，声音中带着难以置信。

Shinji just threw up his hands "Seriously, was it so hard to see that? The girl practically lived in a condemned building, looked like my mother, and acted startlingly similar to a robot; I'd say it wasn't too far of a leap."  
真嗣只是双手一摊，“说真的，这很难看出来吗？那女孩几乎住在危楼里，长得像我母亲，行为举止又惊人地像机器人；我觉得这并不算太大的跳跃。”

"What else…" “还有什么……”

"No." he cut her off "Listen, either let me go about my life, or tell me what you want me for, but I'm really not in the mood for heroics right now, or at least until you tell me what you want."  
“不。”他打断她，“听着，要么让我继续我的生活，要么告诉我你想要我做什么，但我现在真的没心情逞英雄，至少在你告诉我你的目的之前。”

"Maybe this will help clear things up," Ristuko spoke up, her voice clearly shaken by the knowledge Shinji had displayed. "Lieutenant, state your name and rank."'  
"或许这能帮助澄清一些事情，"里津子开口说道，她的声音因知晓真嗣所展现的知识而明显颤抖。"中尉，报上你的姓名和军衔。"

"Yes ma'am." the girl said, walking closer to the boy who turned to see her.  
"是的，女士。"女孩说着，走近那个转身看向她的男孩。

"It's kinda late for this, but I'll be your attending medical officer, Second Lieutenant Sakura Suzuhara."  
"虽然有点晚了，但我会是你的随行医疗官，二等中尉樱铃原。"

Shinji's eyebrow raised at the name.  
听到这个名字，真嗣的眉毛微微一挑。

"_Oh, please let this be a girl version of Toji!" Soryu started laughing, "All it took was Toji being born a girl to mess up the timeline."_  
“哦，拜托，希望这是个女性版的飞鸟！” 惣流开始笑了起来，“仅仅因为飞鸟生为女孩，就能把时间线搞得一团糟。”

He just glared at the specter then back to the girl, who had followed his gaze and seemed to understand he was seeing something else there.  
他只是瞪了那幽灵一眼，然后又看向女孩，她似乎理解了他刚才目光所及之处另有他物。

If Toji and his sister swapped places, where she was older and he was younger, that'd be strange, though hardly the strangest thing he'd seen. Shinji had met the tiny girl before but never had he seen her grown up. Looking at her face he had to admit he should have seen it, but it was just so illogical.  
如果东治和他姐姐互换位置，她成了姐姐而他成了弟弟，那确实很奇怪，尽管这远非他见过的最离奇的事。真嗣之前遇见过那个小女孩，但从未见过她长大后的模样。看着她的脸，他不得不承认自己本该预料到这一点，但这实在太过不合逻辑了。

Besides, the girl looked well over 14.  
再说了，那女孩看起来明显超过 14 岁。

"Thank you for being such a good friend to my brother, I'm his little sister, Sakura."  
"谢谢你对我哥哥这么好，我是他的妹妹，小樱。"

"Younger, but… how?" was just confused now. "That doesn't make any sense… how are you younger?"  
"年纪更小，但是……怎么可能？" 现在完全糊涂了。"这说不通啊……你怎么会更年轻？"

"Because it's been 10 years since you ruined everything."  
"因为自从你毁了一切已经过去 10 年了。"

His eyes shifted, and there she was.  
他的目光游移，然后她就在那里。

He locked onto her, in that moment nothing else existed, no one else existed.  
他紧紧锁定她，那一刻，其他的一切都不复存在，其他的人也不复存在。

Time seemed to slow as he drank in every single detail about the girl, he watched come towards him.  
时间仿佛放慢了脚步，他细细品味着女孩的每一个细节，看着她向他走来。

That brace on her leg and the limp as she walked.  
她腿上的支架和她走路时的跛行。

That scar cresting her jawline.  
那道横跨她下颌的伤疤。

The eyepatch over her left eye.  
她左眼上的眼罩。

The red plugsuit he had seen countless times was now patched haphazardly as if it had been through hundreds of battles. The jacket she wore over top of it was a strange sight along with the hat that adorned her head.  
那件他见过无数次的红色紧身衣，如今被胡乱修补，仿佛经历了无数场战斗。她外面套着的那件夹克，以及头上戴的帽子，都显得格外奇特。

The red hair wasn't Soryu's, instead, it was the color of Shikinami's and it was so much longer now, unkempt and wild, he was sure the girl purposefully made it fall down, and slightly cover her eyepatch.  
那红发并非惣流，而是式波的颜色，如今更长了，凌乱而狂野，他确信这女孩有意让它垂落，微微遮住眼罩。

And that blue iris. God… he had never seen her with such a tired look.  
还有那蓝色的虹膜。天啊……他从没见过她如此疲惫的神情。

Yet, despite all that, despite every last imperfection he could list as she walked towards him, she was still beautiful to him.  
然而，尽管如此，尽管他能列举出她走向他时的每一个不完美之处，她在他眼中依然美丽。

However, as she walked towards him, his mind couldn't help but see the image of another bandaged girl on a beach superimposed over her figure. Asuka advanced to the window, reaching down into the top of her jacket and pulling something out as she finally reached him.  
然而，当她向他走来时，他的脑海中不由自主地浮现出另一个缠着绷带的女孩在海滩上的身影，与她的轮廓重叠。明日香走到窗前，伸手探入夹克顶部，终于走到他面前时，从中抽出了某样东西。

The sound of metal hitting glass resounded throughout the room as Shinji's eyes widened at the sight of a Greek cross resting against the window.  
金属撞击玻璃的声音在房间内回响，真嗣的眼睛因看到窗上贴着的希腊十字架而睁大。

"Talk." “说吧。”

There were no words he could conjure up, no declarations of innocence, no proclamations he could force out his throat now. Not when he could only see that blue iris, ablaze with pain. There was no hatred, nothing told him he should be worried or prepare to be pummeled, instead, he just turned to face her fully.  
他找不到任何言辞，无法宣告自己的清白，也无法从喉咙里挤出任何宣言。当他只能看到那只蓝色的瞳孔，燃烧着痛苦时，一切言语都显得苍白无力。没有仇恨，没有任何迹象告诉他应该担心或准备挨打，相反，他只是完全转向她。

Merely inches apart, and separated by that sheet of glass, neither said anything, all Shinji could do was raise his hand, and place it on top of her own.  
仅仅相隔几英寸，却被那层玻璃隔开，两人都没有说话，真嗣所能做的只是举起手，轻轻放在她的手上。

"Roter Drache." he breathed.  
“红龙。”他轻声说道。

Seeing the pendent… it all clicked. Sakura's age, Unit-02 already here… it all fell into place, and yet it still didn't help him understand what was happening, she was still young, what was WILLE, and if it was true, then how had he survived?  
看到那枚吊坠……一切突然清晰起来。小樱的年龄，二号机已经在此……一切都对上了，然而这仍未帮助他理解正在发生的事，她依旧年幼，WILLE 是什么，如果这是真的，那么他是如何幸存下来的？

She had kept it, after all this time…  
她终究还是保留了它，经过了这么长时间……

"Talk," she said again, while Misato straightened up behind her.  
“说吧，”她再次说道，而身后的美里挺直了身子。

"Pilot Shikinami, you were not authorized to be here," she said, even barking at NERV personnel Shinji hadn't heard her voice so cold.  
"碇司令，您未经授权不得进入这里，"她冷冷地说道，连 NERV 的人员真嗣都未曾听过她如此冰冷的声音。

"Will all due respect _Captain_," she spat the word with such venom even Shinji was taken aback "I don't give a damn."  
"恕我直言，舰长，"她咬牙切齿地说出这个词，连真嗣都感到一阵惊讶，"我根本不在乎。"

"I'm sorry." "对不起。"

He had blurted it out without realizing it, but non the less he watched as her eye narrowed at him in annoyance. "I'm so sorry Asuka."  
他无意间脱口而出，但仍注意到她的眼神因恼怒而变得锐利。“真对不起，明日香。”

"If it's been 10 years, then how are you…"  
“如果已经过去十年，那你又是怎么……”

"Because of the curse… The Curse of the EVA." she hissed, but she didn't break eye contact, "I want to know one thing… is it you in there… are you Shinji Ikari?"  
“因为那个诅咒……EVA 的诅咒。”她低声说道，目光未曾移开，“我只想知道一件事……你真的是……碇真嗣吗？”

When compared to his, her 'curse' was pretty mediocre, but he didn't dare laugh, not now when he had to prove to her that it was him somehow…  
与他的相比，她的‘诅咒’显得相当平庸，但他不敢笑，尤其是在他必须以某种方式向她证明自己身份的时候……

"Shikinami…" he breathed, as her face showed understanding.  
“式波……”他轻声说道，她的脸上露出了理解的神情。

Shinji nearly smiled and he brought back his index finger on the glass before sending it forwards, as he began to tap.  
真嗣几乎要微笑了，他将食指重新放在玻璃上，然后向前一推，开始敲击。

Soon his rhythm was clear to all, though only one would understand it. Her eye went wide as the notes began to flow just as they had years prior, and he swore he could see her own index finger twitch in a desire to join him.  
很快，他的节奏变得清晰可见，尽管只有一人能真正理解。她的眼睛因音符如多年前般流淌而睁大，他发誓能看到她自己的食指因渴望加入而微微抽动。

Sixty-two seconds later, no one had said a word, but Shinji could tell… it was all he needed to do to get her to understand.  
六十二秒过去了，无人言语，但真嗣能感觉到……这已足够让她明白一切。

"Why did you do it?" she asked finally, "Why did you try to end the world?"  
“你为什么要这么做？”她终于问道，“你为何试图终结这个世界？”

Alarm bells went off inside the boy's head, what the hell was she talking about? Ending the world?  
警钟在男孩脑海中敲响，她到底在说什么鬼话？终结世界？

"I didn't…" "我并没有……"

"Don't even try to deny it Shinji!" Misato barked, finally raising her voice, "Kaji told me everything, you knew about the Human Instrumentality Project, you knew about SEELE, and your father. So, tell me why I shouldn't treat you just like every other SEELE operative we've caught."  
"别试图否认了，真嗣！" 美里终于提高了嗓门，厉声说道，"加持把一切都告诉我了，你知道人类补完计划，你知道 SEELE，还有你的父亲。那么，告诉我为什么我不应该像对待其他被捕的 SEELE 特工一样对待你。"

"You actually think… I was part of SEELE?" he asked in disbelief, "And I never tried to initiate instrumentality, what the hell are you talking about?"  
"你真的以为……我是 SEELE 的一员？" 他难以置信地问道，"我从未试图启动人类补完计划，你到底在说什么鬼话？"

"Ikari." Asuka said in a low voice, drawing him back to her gaze, "Tell me the truth."  
"碇。" 明日香低声说道，将他的注意力拉回到她的目光中，"告诉我真相。"

"The truth…" he echoed. "真相……" 他重复道。"

"_Go on Third, tell her everything," Soryu goaded from behind him, "tell her all about how you left me to die, tell her about what you did to me."_  
"继续，三号，告诉她一切，" 索留在他身后怂恿道，"告诉她你是如何抛弃我等死的，告诉她你对我做了什么。"

"Asuka…. I…" his words caught in his throat; he had spent so long keeping secrets from any of them that just considering telling even one was hard.  
"明日香…. 我…" 他的话卡在喉咙里；他花了太长时间对任何人保密，以至于仅仅考虑透露一个秘密都很难。"

"I'm not with SEELE." he started, "I'm not part of Gendo's plan, I tried to help Kaji."  
"我不是和 SEELE 一伙的。" 他开始说，"我不是参与了碇源堂的计划，我试图帮助加持。"

Misato's eyes narrowed, clearly, she didn't believe him, "Is that why you threatened him?"  
美里眯起眼睛，显然，她并不相信他，“这就是你威胁他的原因吗？”

Shinji said nothing, unable to give her an answer before she continued.  
真嗣一言不发，还没来得及给她一个答案，她就继续说了下去。

"And you knew about Unit-03, didn't you?" she asked again, as he looked back to Asuka, who was unaffected by the accusation.  
“而且你知道三号机的事，对吧？”她再次问道，而他回头看向明日香，她对这指控毫不在意。

"I assumed there would be an Angel inside Unit-03, yes." He admitted closing his eyes, "but Asuka was never meant to pilot it."  
"我原本以为 03 号机里会有一个使徒，是的。" 他闭上眼睛承认道，"但明日香从未被安排去驾驶它。"

"How did you know?" the redhead asked.  
"你怎么知道的？" 红发女孩问道。"

Opening his eyes to her, she hadn't taken her hand down, slowly the glass between them had gotten warmer and he could feel the heat radiating off her palm just slightly.  
他睁开眼睛看向她，她的手仍未放下，慢慢地，他们之间的玻璃变得温暖起来，他能感觉到她手掌散发出的微微热量。

"I know things." he said slowly, "because…"  
"我知道一些事情。" 他缓缓说道，"因为……"

Between trying to escape and blatantly talking to his invisible companions, there was no way to explain this, there was no excuse he could use now.  
在试图逃脱和公然与他的隐形同伴交谈之间，没有任何方法可以解释这一点，现在他没有任何借口可用。

Perhaps… it was time to drop his act, it was time to tell them exactly what kind of person they were dealing with.  
也许……是时候放下伪装了，是时候告诉他们他们面对的是什么样的人了。

"I… I'm not… It's because…" he stammered, but before he could continue the room exploded.  
“我……我不是……因为……”他结巴着，但还没等他说完，房间就爆炸了。

A cloud of debris fell over all of them as they were blown back. Shinji himself was sent into the wall, left dazed by the force of the impact.  
一阵碎片云笼罩了他们所有人，被冲击波吹得倒退。真嗣自己也被甩到了墙上，撞击的力道让他一时晕眩。

"_**Shinji**_." “真嗣。”

What the… 什么鬼……

Finally opening his eyes, the gale-force winds swiftly cleaned out any cloud that had previously obscured his vision, unfortunately, that wind was coming directly from outside the ship.  
终于睁开双眼，狂风骤雨般的气流迅速驱散了先前遮挡视线的云雾，可惜，这股风正直接从船外袭来。

And a massive hand was there where the blue sky should be.  
而本该是蓝天的地方，出现了一只巨大的手掌。

Scrambling up and scooting to the far corner, the unconscious body of Sakura laid dangerously close to the Evangelion's hand and jagged ledge. Grabbing the girl, he dragged her over away with him.  
慌忙爬起，挪到角落，樱的昏迷身体危险地靠近了 EVA 的手和锯齿状的边缘。他抓住女孩，将她拖离自己。

"What the fuck is that Misato!" he yelled through the winds, only to see the woman clutching her head and pushing herself off the ground.  
“这他妈是什么东西，美里！”他对着风大喊，只见那女人抱着头，挣扎着从地上起身。

Suddenly, melting upwards from the hand, Shinji watched as three arms began to rise, each slithering towards him.  
突然，从手部开始融化上升，真嗣眼看着三条手臂开始升起，每一条都向他蜿蜒而来。

"_**Come with me Shinji**_." the voice spoke again.  
“跟我来，真嗣。”那个声音再次响起。

To hell with that. 去他的。

Really not having any kind of weapons, Shinji grabbed the chair he had been sitting on and blocked the first arm that lunged at him. However, in an event that was shocking to no one, the two he hadn't blocked promptly wrapped around his legs causing him to fall.  
手无寸铁的 Shinji 抓起他坐过的椅子，挡住了第一只向他扑来的手臂。然而，对所有人来说并不意外的是，他未能挡住的两只手臂迅速缠上了他的双腿，使他摔倒在地。

Swiftly he was dragged over to that hand, unable to hold onto anything that might keep him from being taken.  
他很快就被拖向那只手，无法抓住任何可能让他不被带走的东西。

Until a hand reached out and grabbed his.  
直到一只手伸出来，抓住了他。

"I'm not letting you go that easily, Idiot!"  
"我才不会让你这么轻易逃掉，笨蛋！"

Shinji was met with the face of an irate Asuka, whose red hand was now firmly latched onto his, desperately trying to pull him from the Evangelion's grip. her hat had fallen off, causing her hair to dance like flames in the high winds.  
真嗣面对着愤怒的明日香，她的红手紧紧抓住他的手，拼命想把他从 EVA 的掌控中拉出来。她的帽子已经掉落，头发在强风中像火焰一样舞动。

"Asuka, you're not going to be able…."  
"明日香，你不会能够……"

"Shut up! I want answers Third! You think I'm just going to let her take you?!"  
"闭嘴！我要答案，三号！你以为我会让她带走你吗？！"

Her other hand was latched onto a piece of metal sheet, left jagged by the Evangelion punching a hole in the ship.  
她的另一只手紧紧抓住一块金属板，这块金属板因福音战士在船上打出的洞而边缘参差不齐。

"Asuka…" Shinji could do nothing but look at that one brilliant blue eye, fully understanding the pain the girl harbored.  
"明日香……" 真嗣只能凝视着那只闪耀的蓝色眼睛，完全理解了女孩所承受的痛苦。

Both their hands began to slip, and the girl gritted her teeth in trying to hold onto him.  
两人的手开始打滑，女孩咬紧牙关试图抓住他。

"…come find me, I'll tell you everything, I promise!"  
“……来找我，我会告诉你一切，我保证！”

Slowly all they had left were their fingers hooked between them until ultimately, their hands broke apart, and Shinji was left only feeling himself being chilled by the jet stream.  
渐渐地，他们只剩下手指相互勾连，直到最终，双手分离，真嗣只感到自己被喷流冻得冰凉。

**The previous chapter had to be worked on a bit, between my lackluster awareness, Word, and this site refusing to save changes, there were a few ajustments made, nothing serious but still might be worthwhile to check the last chapter again.  
上一篇chapter需要稍作调整，由于我乏善可陈的意识、Word 以及这个网站拒绝保存更改，做了一些微调，虽不严重，但仍值得再次检查上一篇chapter。**

**For this chapter I really do feel it was better to not have Shinji fully spill the beans. He confirms a few things while rejecting others, both sides get information and suddenly they have more questions, but I felt this was the right amount of admission for Shinji, between his actions and discussion it's a good setup for when he finally confesses the full truth.  
对于这篇chapter，我确实觉得不让真嗣完全坦白更好。他确认了一些事情，同时否认了其他，双方都获得了信息，却突然有了更多疑问，但我认为这对真嗣来说是合适的坦白程度，结合他的行动和讨论，为他最终坦白全部真相做好了铺垫。**

**Would it have been cool to see Shinji break down and tell them everything? Sure I guess, but it just isn't for this story, I've drafted this part four times over the last few months and I feel this is the best balance between all the aspects I wanted to touch on.  
看到真嗣崩溃并告诉他们一切会不会很酷？当然，我猜，但这不适合这个故事，过去几个月我草拟了这部分四次，我觉得这是触及我想表达的所有方面的最佳平衡。**

**SHOUTOUTS! 特别鸣谢！**

**anirudhverma09 – Yeah I didn't want to drag this out anymore.  
anirudhverma09 – 是的，我不想再拖下去了。**

NoseGum – 宝贝？你知道吗？我接受！**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – If only disarming the collar was so simple, damn the Rebuild Timeline and its slight changes!  
美国超旋队 —— 要是解开项圈能这么简单就好了，该死的重构时间线及其微小的变动！**

**YodaMorpheus7 – Why? Because it's fun! And yeah, thought Kaji kinda spilling the beans on the kid who knew too much was a good route.  
YodaMorpheus7 – 为什么？因为有趣！没错，我觉得让加持稍微透露一点那个知道太多的孩子的信息是个不错的方向。**

**dyinglittelstar – That scar isn't the only one, :(  
dyinglittelstar – 那道伤疤不是唯一的，:(**

**SheriffJohnStone – Yeah, I want to definitely touch on Asuka's years alone during this part of the story.  
SheriffJohnStone – 是的，我确实想在这部分故事中触及明日香孤独的那些年。**

**JIM D. ZAS – Thanks!  
JIM D. ZAS – 谢谢！**

**Lupeskillz – How wholesome was hands pressing against class?  
Lupeskillz – 手按在课桌上，多么温馨的一幕啊？**

**KingXanaduu – Oh I feel that Asuka isn't really sure what to feel, since Shinji was gone, if she's angry, its because he 'left' her alone.  
KingXanaduu – 哦，我觉得明日香并不确定自己的感受，因为真嗣离开了，如果她生气，那是因为他‘抛下’了她一个人。**

**kempn200252 – Assessment of Misato? Bingo, spot on. Bravo, however, there was a 4****th** **option. Thanks!**  
kempn200252 – 对美里评价的评估？答对了，完全正确。不过，还有第四个选项。谢谢！

**skyf0x – I'd like to focus a lot on her time alone, a bit of a 'tale of two pilots', for 3.0, both alone. Asuka's gone through a lot over the last six years and I intend to show her journey. While shedding light on what transpired over the timeskip. Thanks! Hope you enjoyed chapter!  
skyf0x – 我希望能着重描绘她在 3.0 中独自一人的时光，有点像是“两位飞行员的传说”，两人都孤独。明日香在过去六年经历了许多，我打算展现她的这段旅程，同时揭示时间跳跃期间发生的事情。谢谢！希望你喜欢《1001》！**

**Yeah, I'm late. Life has a way of getting in the way at the exact wrong time.  
是啊，我迟到了。生活总在最关键的时刻横插一脚。**

**Until Next Time 下次再见**


### Chapter 46: "…Let the wine of friendship never run dry…"  
Chapter 46: "…愿友谊之酒永不干涸…"

Misato clutched her head as she pushed herself up from the cold floor of the interrogation room. The ringing from the explosion was dissipating but she wasn't sure what was going on. Feeling the air billowing in, she instantly scanned the room, searching for all five figures that should have been there.  
美里紧抓着头，从审讯室的冰冷地板上挣扎起身。爆炸的轰鸣声逐渐消散，但她仍不清楚发生了什么。感受到空气的涌动，她立刻扫视房间，寻找那本应存在的五个人影。

She only counted four. 她只数到了四个。

"Misato!" the distinct voice of Ritsuko shouted "The remote!"  
“美里！”律子那独特的声音喊道，“遥控器！”

Her eyes widened as her mind realized who was missing. Climbing to her feet, Misato pulled the trigger-like remote from her jacket. The small display showed that the collar was in range and her finger went to the trigger on instinct.  
当她意识到少了谁时，眼睛瞪大了。美里站起身来，从夹克里掏出那个像枪一样的遥控器。小屏幕显示项圈在有效范围内，她的手指本能地移向了触发器。

But she didn't press down.  
但她并未按下。

She wanted to press it, she couldn't let NERV have him, even if he had just protested his innocence, there were so many unanswered questions. Her finger began to shake, and the memory of the last time she had been indecisive flooded back into her mind.  
她本想按下，她不能让 NERV 得到他，即便他刚刚申辩了自己的清白，仍有太多未解之谜。她的手指开始颤抖，上一次犹豫不决的记忆如潮水般涌入脑海。

For the first time in years, she heard the screams of a child she had sent to slaughter.  
多年来，她第一次听到了那个她送入屠场的孩子发出的尖叫声。

Looking up, she just saw the figure of Asuka standing there, hair blowing from the frigid slipstream. The girl was turned towards the sky, just standing there at the edge of the hole in the hull.  
抬头望去，她只看到明日香站在那里，头发在冰冷的滑流中飘扬。女孩面向天空，就那样站在船体破洞的边缘。

Finally, the pilot turned back, looking at her with that one blue eye. The girl knew she could do it; she had the power to do it and Asuka couldn't stop her. Nothing could stop her right now.  
终于，驾驶员转过身来，用那只蓝色的眼睛看着她。女孩知道她能做到；她有这个力量，明日香无法阻止她。此刻，没有什么能阻止她。

They just stared at each other, no words being said, but Misato knew exactly what she wanted to say. Her finger still shook, but in the end, a small beep indicated that the collar was out of range.  
她们只是彼此凝视，没有言语，但美里完全明白她想说什么。她的手指仍在颤抖，但最终，一声微弱的哔声表明项圈已超出范围。

Before she could say anything though, Asuka strode across the room, beelining straight for her.  
然而，她还没来得及开口，明日香就大步穿过房间，直奔她而来。

*SMACK* *啪*

A familiar stinging sensation bloomed on her cheek, as a red flash of color indicated the girl's swift exit of the room.  
熟悉的刺痛感在她脸颊上蔓延开来，一抹红色闪过，表明女孩已迅速离开了房间。

The commander of WILLE could feel her subordinate's eyes watching her, probably wanting to say something, but ultimately, she moved to the other side of the room, to collect Toji's sister and help her out of the room, leaving the captain alone once again.  
WILLE 的指挥官能感觉到她的下属在注视着她，可能想说些什么，但最终，她走向房间的另一侧，去接 Toji 的妹妹并帮助她离开房间，留下舰长独自一人。

As they all left the room, nothing was said, the commander of WILLE instead took to her cabin, sure that her vice-commander would take care of things. Walking through the corridors, Misato finally came to the captain's quarters and was not entirely surprised to see a young man standing there.  
当他们全部离开房间时，没有人说话，WILLE 的指挥官转而回到自己的船舱，确信她的副指挥官会处理好一切。穿过走廊，Misato 终于来到舰长的房间，看到一个年轻人站在那里，她并不完全感到意外。

Saluting, the man handed a datapad to her, "Captain, we received a transmission from the UN coalition, they demand an update."  
年轻人敬了个礼，递给她一个数据板，"舰长，我们收到了联合国联盟的通讯，他们要求更新情况。"

Misato nodded and waved him off, scrolling through the message she sighed and continued to walk, it was better to speak with them sooner rather than later.  
美里点点头，挥手让他离开，一边浏览着信息，一边叹了口气，继续前行。还是尽早和他们谈谈比较好。

ʡʘʘʘʢ

Shinji sat in some metal dome that had melted upwards from the ground. He didn't understand it, then again, it probably was better than simply being clutched in the bare hand of an Evangelion. He really didn't know how he'd survive whatever journey this was if he'd been exposed to the freezing air at this altitude.  
真嗣坐在一个从地面熔化升起的金属穹顶里。他不明白这是怎么回事，但话说回来，总比被一个 EVA 赤手空拳地抓着要好。他真不知道如果暴露在这种高度的寒冷空气中，自己该如何度过这段旅程。

Shinji just rested against the metal, doing his best to keep warm... Curled up, he shivered from the cold and rubbed his arms trying desperately to create some warmth, while he thought about what had just transpired.  
真嗣只是靠在金属上，尽力保持温暖……蜷缩着身子，他因寒冷而颤抖，拼命地摩擦双臂试图制造一些温暖，同时思考着刚刚发生的事情。

He hadn't died and more than that…  
他并未死去，不仅如此……

"…_I'll tell you everything…"_  
……我会告诉你一切……

Really? He was finally going to spill his guts?  
真的吗？他终于要吐露心声了？

How many times had that gone well?  
那次顺利过多少次了？

For the first time since he'd woken up, his eyelids began to feel heavy, and he decided it was best to get whatever kind of rest he could before he faced wherever he was being taken.  
自醒来后，他第一次感到眼皮沉重，决定在面对即将被带往的地方之前，尽可能地休息一下。

ʡʘʘʘʢ

_She hadn't gone on a date this time.  
这次她没有去约会。_

_He didn't think he'd done anything to affect that, but then again, maybe it had to do with it being a permanent winter instead of summer. Maybe, she wouldn't ask for a kiss, maybe deciding to stay in wouldn't bore her.  
他并不觉得自己做了什么会影响这一点，但话说回来，或许这与永冬而非夏日有关。也许，她不会索吻，也许决定留在室内不会让她感到无聊。_

_This life made 55, he'd finally been able to reliably make it to Ramiel and beyond, but when it came to Asuka…  
这 55 次人生中，他终于能够可靠地抵达拉米尔甚至更远的地方，但当涉及到明日香时……_

_The boy had to admit it was still hit or miss, but it was better than the first time, that was for sure. Figuring out what she really meant behind her words was getting easier, and he was definitely starting to relax around her.  
男孩不得不承认这仍然是碰运气，但肯定比第一次好。理解她话语背后的真正含义变得更容易了，他确实开始在她周围放松下来。_

_Shinji looked up from his magazine to see the girl clamoring through the kitchen, looking for something on the top shelves. He wondered what she could possibly be hungry for after the large dinner he had made for them before his eyes widened as she came down with a bottle of sake.  
真嗣从杂志上抬起头，看到女孩在厨房里翻找着，寻找放在高架上的东西。他好奇她在晚餐后还能饿着找什么，直到她拿着一瓶清酒下来，他的眼睛才睁大。_

"_Asuka… what are you doing?" he asked, his tone clearly telling her he thought this wasn't a good idea._  
"明日香…你在做什么？"他问道，语气明显表明他认为这不是个好主意。

"_Misato isn't coming home," she said smiling as she examined the bottle._  
"美里不会回家了，"她微笑着说，同时仔细打量着那瓶酒。

_Looking over to him, he must have been wearing a worried expression, because she smirked and shook the bottle at him.  
她转头看向他，他一定是一脸担忧的表情，因为她得意地笑了笑，并朝他摇了摇手中的瓶子。_

"_What? Worried she might find out? I won't tell if you don't."_  
"什么？担心她会发现？你不说，我就不说。"

_The girl strode over to the living room and placed the bottle down on the short table in the middle of the room. Shinji leaned in to examine it while she walked back to the cabinet and retrieved a pair of sake cups.  
女孩大步走向客厅，将瓶子放在房间中央的矮桌上。真嗣凑近查看，而她则走回橱柜，取出一对酒杯。_

_He had tasted Misato's beer one life, an offer from his drunken guardian. It had a terrible taste, causing him to spit it back out instantly, causing an eruption of laughter from the woman.  
他曾尝过一次美里小姐的啤酒，那是醉酒监护人的提议。那味道糟透了，让他立刻吐了出来，引得那位女士爆发出一阵大笑。_

_Now Asuka sat across from him and placed both cups down on the table.  
此刻，明日香坐在他对面，将两个杯子放在桌上。_

"_C'mon, don't tell me you've never had a drink before."_  
“来吧，别告诉我你从没喝过酒。”

_Shinji shook his head, as she opened the bottle and poured them both a drink.  
真嗣摇了摇头，她便打开瓶子，给他们俩各倒了一杯。_

"_Good, at least you're not completely boring. Here," she said, pushing the second glass to him while picking up her own._  
"不错，至少你还没完全无聊。来，"她说着，将第二杯酒推给他，同时拿起自己的杯子。

_Asuka smirked as Shinji mirrored her, "What are we toasting Third?"  
明日香微微一笑，真嗣也模仿她的动作，"我们这是在庆祝什么呢，三号？"_

"_Long life." He said softly, as Asuka downed the drink, unaware of the weight behind those two words._  
"长寿。"他轻声说道，而明日香一饮而尽，并未察觉这两个字背后的沉重。

_Following suit, Shinji had to admit it was better than beer, it has a somewhat sweet taste at first, but then his mouth was burned by the alcohol. Swallowing quickly, he coughed at the fiery sensation in his throat.  
效仿之下，真嗣不得不承认这比啤酒好喝，起初带点甜味，但随即就被酒精烧灼了口腔。他快速吞咽，却被喉咙里的火辣感呛得咳嗽起来。_

"_Wow, you really are an amateur." Asuka laughed as she poured another glass and downed it swiftly. At this rate, she was not going to be feeling great tomorrow morning, and Shinji knew he'd be the one suffering for it._  
“哇，你真是个新手。”明日香笑着又倒了一杯，迅速一饮而尽。照这样下去，她明早肯定不好受，而真嗣知道，自己将会是那个为此受罪的人。

"_Well, what makes you such an expert?" he asked, placing the glass back on the table._  
“那么，你又凭什么自诩专家呢？”他问道，将杯子放回桌上。

"_Europe's a bit more relaxed with drinking," she explained, while filling his cup "Wine's very popular… my Dad let me have some every once in and awhile." She finished, that second part said in a softer voice. "Plus, there were the times he didn't know about."_  
"欧洲对饮酒的态度稍微宽松些，" 她边解释边为他斟满杯子，"葡萄酒非常受欢迎……我爸爸偶尔也会让我喝一点。" 她轻声补充道，"还有那些他不知道的时候。"

"_Anyways," and suddenly she was full of energy again, "how about a drinking game?"_  
"话说回来，" 她突然又充满了活力，"来玩个喝酒游戏怎么样？"

_Oh god.  哦，天哪。_

"_Truth or Dare. Don't follow instructions, and you have to take a drink." She said slyly, her face mirroring the one he had seen when_ _Gaghiel attacked._  
"真心话大冒险。不按指令行事，就得喝一杯。" 她狡黠地说道，脸上浮现出他曾在加吉尔袭击时见过的那种神情。

_She was going to be the death of him.  
她会要了他的命。_

"_Alright," he said, snatching his glass, "what are we stopping at?"_  
"好吧，" 他一把抓过杯子，"我们这是在哪儿停下？"

"_How about three?"_ "三杯如何？"

"_Sure."_  “当然。”

"_Hmm," Asuka pondered her question for a moment, probably running every single embarrassing query through her brain, "Truth. Why are you here with Misato? Shouldn't you be staying with your dad?"_  
"嗯，" 明日香沉思了一会儿，大概在脑海中过了一遍所有尴尬的问题，"真心话。你为什么和美里在一起？不应该和你爸爸待在一起吗？"

_Shinji's hand subconsciously gripped the sake cup tighter at the mention of Gendo Ikari.  
听到碇源堂的名字，真嗣的手不由自主地握紧了酒杯。_

"_No," he said sharply, before realizing how harsh his tone had been, "I don't want anything to do with him." He finished, making sure Asuka didn't perceive the disdain in his voice as being directed at her and not at his father._  
“不，”他语气尖锐地说道，随即意识到自己的语气过于严厉，“我不想和他有任何瓜葛。”他补充道，确保明日香不会误以为他对父亲的厌恶是针对她而不是他的父亲。

"_Hmmm,"_ “嗯……”

"_Alright, my turn," he said leaning back, thinking about anything that wouldn't either upset her or he didn't already know…_  
“好了，轮到我了，”他向后靠去，思索着任何不会让她难过或他尚未知晓的话题……

_That was a hard one.  
那可真是个难题。_

"_I dare you to play your violin." He said smugly._  
"我敢你拉小提琴。" 他得意地说道。

"_I don't have a violin idiot!" She rolled her eyes, before stopping and narrowing them, "Wait… how do you know I even played?"_  
"我没有小提琴，白痴！" 她翻了个白眼，随即停下并眯起眼睛，"等等……你怎么知道我会拉小提琴？"

_He rubbed his neck sheepishly, "Ah, don't you remember me asking you?"  
他腼腆地揉了揉脖子，“啊，你不记得我之前问过你吗？”_

"_No."_ "不。"

"_Alright, um… What's your favorite movie?" he asked, unwilling to really ask any deep questions. It should have been a softball question, but instead, the girl's brow furrowed._  
“好吧，呃……你最喜欢的电影是什么？”他问道，不愿触及任何深层次的问题。这本应是个轻松的问题，但女孩的眉头却皱了起来。

"_I… um…" she stumbled on her words and just took a drink from her cup in a hurried annoyance._  
“我……呃……”她结巴着，急躁地拿起杯子喝了一口。

"_What?" he asked but was silenced by her._  
"什么？" 他问道，却被她制止了。

"_Dare. Go ring the neighbor's doorbell and run away." She said quickly._  
"敢不敢。去按邻居的门铃然后跑掉。" 她迅速说道。

"_Wait, Asuka…"_ "等等，明日香……"

"_Go do it Third! It's your turn!"_  
"去吧，三号！轮到你了！"

_Shinji instead took a gulp from his glass, why wouldn't she tell him something so simple?  
真嗣却只是从杯中喝了一口，为什么她连这么简单的事都不告诉他？_

"_Alright, my turn, why won't you tell me?"_  
"好吧，轮到我了，你为什么不告诉我？"

"_You're really gonna waste a round on this?" she asked._  
"你真的要用一发子弹来对付这个吗？" 她问道。

"_Yes."_ "是的。"

_She just stared at him with an incredulous look on her face, before slowly pulling her legs up to her chest. Shinji knew that look, he knew that body language, she was trying to pull away from him and into herself.  
她只是带着难以置信的表情盯着他，然后慢慢地把腿蜷缩到胸前。真嗣知道那种表情，知道那种肢体语言，她正试图从他身边抽离，退缩到自己的世界里。_

"_I… didn't watch a whole lot of movies as a kid." She said simply, just fiddling with her glass and avoiding his gaze. Shinji wanted to say something, maybe a reassurance that he too didn't have the chance to see many movies, but the words caught in his throat._  
"我……小时候没怎么看电影。" 她简单地说道，只是摆弄着她的杯子，避开他的目光。真嗣想说些什么，也许是一句安慰的话，告诉他也没有机会看很多电影，但话到嘴边却卡住了。

"_How about… play me something nice on your cello!" and just like that she was back to her fiery self, letting her legs down and crossing them underneath her._  
"不如……用你的大提琴给我演奏点好听的吧！" 话音刚落，她又恢复了往日的火辣，双腿放下，交叉着盘坐在身下。

_He shrugged and got up to go to his room, instantly noting his balance was off, it was a bit weird, but his drink must've been taking affect faster than he originally thought it would. Coming back out, he placed his instrument against the wall and went to the kitchen. Looking through the cabinets for anything to snack on before bringing out a bag of snacks.  
他耸了耸肩，起身走向自己的房间，立刻注意到自己的平衡感有些不对劲，有点奇怪，但可能是饮料的效果比他预想的来得更快。回来时，他将乐器靠在墙上，走向厨房。在橱柜里翻找着任何可以充饥的东西，然后拿出一袋零食。_

"_Eating helps," he said simply before readying his bow to the sound of Asuka munching._  
"吃东西有帮助，" 他简单地说道，同时准备着弓，耳边是明日香咀嚼的声音。

_He thought of a song to play, and a smile formed on his face. They hadn't needed to do any sync training this time, he had simply found himself fighting alongside her against Israfel, simply making sure to keep pace with her without really having to do any work. So, she'd never heard the song.  
他想到了一首曲子要弹，脸上露出了微笑。这次他们无需进行任何同步训练，他只是自然而然地与她并肩对抗伊斯拉斐尔，只需确保跟上她的节奏，无需费力。因此，她从未听过这首歌。_

_He started, unleashing a torrent of notes for 62 seconds, and judging by the applause at the end, just had she had done in his first life on this night, he had to believe that she truly enjoyed it.  
他开始演奏，62 秒内倾泻出连绵不绝的音符，而根据终曲时响起的掌声判断，正如她在他此生今夜的初次演奏中所做的那样，他不得不相信她是真心喜爱这段乐章。_

"_It's supposed to be a duet." He said with a smile, only to earn a scowl from her._  
"这本该是二重唱的。" 他笑着说，却换来她的一记白眼。

_As he sat back down, he definitely felt the alcohol start to take effect. His world was beginning to be uneasy and his balance even sitting there was starting to wane.  
当他重新坐下时，他明显感觉到酒精开始起作用了。他的世界开始变得不安稳，即便只是坐着，平衡感也逐渐减弱。_

"_Um… tell me 'bout yor life before." She said simply, her speech subtly beginning to slur._  
“呃……跟我说说你以前的生活吧。”她简单地说道，言语间隐约开始含糊不清。

_His heart rate quickened, and a bit of terror crept into his mind at the thought of her asking that question.  
他的心跳加速，想到她可能会问那个问题，一丝恐惧悄然爬上心头。_

"_What?"_ “什么？”

"_Yu now, before bein a pilot!" she asked again, annoyed at his lack of understanding._  
"现在，在成为飞行员之前！" 她再次问道，对他的不解感到恼火。

"_Oh… yeah…" the panic started to recede, how silly had it been that he had instantly thought of that._  
"哦… 是的…" 恐慌开始消退，他立刻想到那个问题，真是太傻了。

"_It was…"_ "那时是……"

_Now a different dread swelled within him. What had it been like then? What had_ he _been like? Peaceful? Empty? Meaningless? Of all the things the EVA had done to him, giving him meaning was something he couldn't rebut as much as he hated that fact._  
此刻，另一种恐惧在他心中升起。那时的生活是怎样的？他又是怎样的？平静？空虚？无意义？EVA 对他所做的一切中，赋予他意义这一点，尽管他痛恨这个事实，却无法反驳。

_Perhaps the scariest thing was his inability to really recall anything substantial before coming to Tokyo-03. It was all just a grey fog, identical days of simply going through the motions.  
或许最可怕的是，他无法真正回忆起在来到东京-03 之前任何具体的事情。那一切都只是一片灰色的迷雾，日复一日，只是机械地度过。_

"_It was… peaceful." He said truthfully, "But… did you ever have that feeling that… there should have been more? Like there was something you were looking for but couldn't find?"_  
"真是……宁静。" 他真诚地说道，"但是……你是否有过那种感觉，好像……应该有更多的东西？就像你在寻找什么却始终找不到一样？"

_She said nothing and just brought up her glass, taking the liquid all down in one gulp.  
她一言不发，只是举起酒杯，一饮而尽。_

"_I daare you toooo…" she thought for a moment, "Strip!" she said while snickering, clearly amused with herself._  
"我敢打赌你不敢……" 她想了一会儿，"脱衣服！" 她一边窃笑一边说，显然对自己感到十分得意。

"_I'm not doing that." He said flatly._  
"我不会那么做的。" 他平淡地说道。

"_Well tak ah drik Third."_  
"好吧，喝第三杯。"

"_Alright," he said, his mind growing cloudy, he could end this one, "why do you even want to pilot?"_  
"好吧，" 他说，思绪逐渐模糊，他可以结束这一切，"你为什么还想驾驶呢？"

_She was silent, before picking up her glass and chugging it. Now they were 2 -2.  
她沉默片刻，随即抓起杯子一饮而尽。现在比分是 2 比 2。_

"_I dare you to…." He knew that look in her eye, even now with the woozy feeling coursing through him, he knew this wasn't going to be good._  
“我敢打赌你……”他熟悉她眼中的那种神情，即便此刻醉意朦胧，他也知道这不会是什么好事。

"_Kiss me."_ “吻我。”

_Shinji's mind had heard her asking for a kiss plenty of times, but right now he couldn't help but blurt out exactly what he had said the first time.  
真嗣的内心早已无数次听到她索吻的声音，但此刻他情不自禁地脱口而出，正是他第一次说的话。_

"_What?"_ “什么？”

"_Looks like I win!" she laughed, throwing her hands up, "Invincible Shinji toppled by something so stupid."_  
“看来是我赢了！”她笑着举起双手，“无敌的真嗣竟然被这么愚蠢的事情打败了。”

_Stupid huh? 愚蠢吗？_

_Shinji pushed himself forwards, crawling on all fours around the stubby table, wobbly as he went. Asuka felt her heart racing in her chest as he got closer, unable to believe that he was going to do it.  
真嗣向前爬行，四肢着地绕过矮桌，摇摇晃晃地前进。明日香感到心跳加速，难以置信他真的要这么做。_

_He crawled closer to the Indian-style sitting girl, slowly closing in while she leaned back still not sure of what was happening despite her asking him to do this.  
他向着盘腿而坐的女孩爬近，逐渐逼近，而她虽然让他这么做，却仍靠后仰着，对正在发生的事感到不确定。_

_With a subdued squeal, she fell backward, now on her back as the boy crawled over her, his hands resting beside her head.  
她发出一声低沉的尖叫，向后倒去，仰面躺着，男孩爬到她身上，双手放在她头旁。_

_Their eyes were locked, and Shinji felt himself lowering himself closer to her.  
他们的目光紧紧相锁，真嗣感到自己正缓缓向她靠近。_

_What did it matter if he did kiss her? The boy's mind was exploding at the idea of actually doing it again, actually tasting her soft lips and holding her for once while they both enjoyed it. God, he wanted to, why shouldn't he?  
如果他真的吻了她，这又有什么关系呢？男孩的思绪因这个念头而沸腾，想象着再次真正地亲吻她，品尝她柔软的唇瓣，并在这一刻拥她入怀，共同享受这份美好。天啊，他渴望这么做，为何不呢？_

_He reached up to her hair, pulling out the A10 clips she always wore, if he was going to do this… he wanted her to be free first.  
他伸手抚上她的发丝，轻轻取下她常戴的 A10 发夹，如果他决定这么做……他希望她能先卸下束缚。_

_Their breathing increased in pace, with the girl not doing anything but waiting, wishing, hoping.  
他们的呼吸加快了节奏，女孩除了等待、期盼、希望，什么也没做。_

_Nothing else existed in that moment, it was only the two of them and the shrinking distance between them. Her eyes were wide, and her mouth was open just slightly, her hair sprawled over the floor like a flower of blood.  
那一刻，别无他物，只有他们两人以及不断缩小的距离。她的眼睛睁得大大的，嘴巴微微张开，头发散落在地板上，宛如一朵血花。_

_Blood. 血。_

_The white bandages were there again, and he could feel the coarse sand under his hands and knees. His vision flickered, back and forth between the two spots in time, one with a blank, emotionless stare that had come to haunt him, and the other a look of longing and hope that had come to drive him.  
白色绷带再次出现，他能感觉到手下和膝下的粗糙沙粒。他的视线在两个时间点之间闪烁，一个是空洞无情的凝视，如今常伴梦魇；另一个则是充满渴望与希望的眼神，激励着他前行。_

_He didn't even realize his hand came up to her cheek, caressing it, as her own came up and covered his hand.  
他甚至没有意识到自己的手已抚上她的脸颊，轻轻摩挲，而她的手也随之覆上他的手。_

_Without even realizing it, she had anchored him there, anchored him to reality, and at that realization, he couldn't stop the tears, just like last time. He collapsed onto her, his arms embracing the girl and head burying itself in the crook of her neck.  
不知不觉中，她已将他牢牢固定在那里，将他紧紧系于现实。意识到这一点，他无法止住泪水，就像上次一样。他倒在她身上，双臂环抱着女孩，头埋进她颈间的弯处。_

"_I'm so sorry Asuka," he choked out, a flood of emotion bursting forth, "I should have saved you."_  
“我真的很抱歉，明日香，”他哽咽着，情感如洪水般涌出，“我本该救你的。”

"_What are yu talkin bout dummy?" She giggled, clearly not understanding why he was sobbing, but nonetheless enjoying his embrace._  
“你在说什么傻话呢，笨蛋？”她咯咯笑着，显然不明白他为何哭泣，但依然享受着他的拥抱。

"_I want to, I want to do it, but I can't, I'm not from here…" he kept going gripping her tighter._  
"我想做，我真的想做，但我做不到，我不是这里的人……" 他紧紧抓着她，不停地重复着。

_God… he just needed to tell someone, he just needed to say those words.  
天啊……他只是需要告诉某个人，他只是需要说出那些话。_

"_I was so stupid," he confessed, squeezing her tighter, "Everyone died…" he said between sobs, "I let you die."_  
"我太蠢了，" 他坦白道，将她抱得更紧，"大家都死了……" 他哽咽着说，"我让你死了。"

"_Third…"_ "第三……"

"_I'm trying to fix it, but I don't know how Asuka, I don't know what to do. I can't keep doing this."_  
"我正努力修复它，但我不懂，明日香，我不知道该怎么办。我不能再这样下去了。"

"_You're being so silly." She said, squeezing him back, her inebriated mind incapable of comprehending the gravity of what was being said._  
"你真是太傻了。" 她说着，紧紧回抱他，她那醉酒的头脑无法理解这番话的严重性。"

"_Please Asuka, don't hate me, please don't hate me." He said over and over, as the tears began to soak into her shirt._  
“求你了，明日香，别恨我，求你别恨我。”他一遍遍地说着，泪水开始浸湿她的衬衫。

_They stayed like that for minutes, the boy just bearing his soul out to the girl, who couldn't understand half of what he was saying. Yet, for the first time, Shinji felt as if some great weight was lifted from him, even if it was only for a moment as he pleaded with her not to hate him.  
他们就这样持续了几分钟，男孩向女孩倾诉着心声，尽管她多半听不懂他在说什么。然而，第一次，真嗣感到某种沉重的负担从他身上卸下了，即便这只是片刻，在他恳求她不要恨他的那一刻。_

"_Shinji?" she said, interrupting his apologies._  
“真嗣？”她打断了他不断的道歉。

"_Yes?" he asked, as the last of his tears fell._  
"什么事？" 他问道，随着最后一滴泪水滑落。

"_I might..." she stopped and the sound of her gagging made him instantly realize what she needed._  
"我可能……" 她突然停下，一阵作呕的声音让他立刻意识到她需要什么。

_As much as he didn't want to move, as much as he wanted to stay there and confess everything he had done, he forced himself to move. Shinji practically picked the girl up with him and hurried her to the bathroom, just in time for her to empty his nicely cooked dinner into the toilet.  
尽管他不想动弹，尽管他渴望留在那里坦白一切，他还是强迫自己行动起来。真嗣几乎是连拖带拽地把女孩带到浴室，正好让她把精心准备的晚餐吐进了马桶。_

_He crouched next to her and held her hair back, hoping the girl wouldn't lash out at him for helping her, though he doubted she'd be up to it if she felt this bad. Reaching up, he flushed that unholy concoction of food and drink down the drain, as she still shakenly gripped the sides of the toilet with white knuckles.  
他蹲在她旁边，扶着她的头发，希望女孩不会因为他帮忙而对他发火，尽管他怀疑她如果感觉这么糟糕，可能也没力气这么做。他伸手将那混合着食物和饮料的不祥之物冲进下水道，而她仍颤抖地紧抓着马桶两侧，指节发白。_

_His free hand went to her back, rubbing it in an attempt to comfort the redhead. It wasn't much, but that didn't mean he couldn't try to sooth her pain.  
他空着的那只手移到她的背上，轻轻揉搓试图安慰这位红发女孩。虽然作用不大，但这并不意味着他不能尝试缓解她的痛苦。_

"_Wha ar yoo stil doin heere Third?" she asked, resting her head against the porcelain edge, probably enjoying the chill it provided._  
“你还在这里做什么，第三？”她问道，将头靠在瓷质边缘上，或许是在享受它带来的凉意。

"_Why would I leave?" he asked gingerly._  
“我为什么要离开？”他小心翼翼地问道。

_Before Asuka could answer, another wave of nausea came over her, and Shinji found himself reaching up to the handle and flushing once more.  
在明日香能回答之前，又一阵恶心感袭来，真嗣发现自己再次伸手去拉冲水把手。_

_Shinji let go of her hair, letting it fall, but making sure it was still out of the way while he got up and grabbed a small towel.  
真嗣松开了她的头发，任其散落，但在起身去拿一条小毛巾时，确保它不会碍事。_

"_Yoo al doo," she said between labored breathing, as he wetted his towel in the sink, "yoo don ike me."_  
“优阿尔杜，”她喘息着说，他正将毛巾浸在洗手池中，“你不喜欢我。”

_Crouching back down, he again gathered her hair and held it back.  
他再次蹲下身，重新拢起她的头发，轻轻向后拉。_

"_That's not true," he said quietly, "I'm not going to leave you, not this time."_  
“那不是真的，”他轻声说道，“我不会离开你，这次不会了。”

_The girl's blue eye's widened, the look of hope she was giving him  
女孩的蓝眼睛睁大了，她眼中流露出的希望之光正投向他。_

"_Promi…" she started, before she clutched her stomach, forcing up another round of vomit, which was met with the sound of the toilet again flushing._  
“普罗米……”她刚开口，便猛地抱住肚子，强忍着又一阵呕吐，随即传来马桶再次冲水的声音。

"_Promise?" she asked weakly, but he just smiled and brought up the wet towel, wiping whatever was left on her face._  
“答应我？”她虚弱地问道，但他只是微笑着拿起湿毛巾，轻轻擦拭她脸上残留的痕迹。

"_I promise."_  "我保证。"

_Asuka's face shifted to one of exhaustion, all the life seemed to have drained out of her as she pushed herself up from the toilet's edge. Lethargically she moved forwards, landing against Shinji's chest with her arms wrapping around him, though he wondered how much of this embrace was to support herself.  
明日香的脸色转为疲惫，仿佛所有的生命力都从她身上流失，她从马桶边缘撑起身来。她无精打采地向前挪动，最终靠在真嗣的胸前，双臂环绕着他，尽管他疑惑这拥抱中有多少是为了支撑自己。_

_He too put his arms around her reassuringly, she wouldn't have to be alone anymore.  
他也用双臂安慰地环抱着她，她再也不必孤单一人了。_

"_Let's get you to bed." He said softly, helping her up and supporting her to her room the best he could._  
“我们送你回床上吧。”他轻声说道，扶她起身，尽其所能地支撑着她走向她的房间。

_Laying her down, he put the covers over her and found a small trashcan to put by her bedside. Taking one last look at the girl, he turned to leave, he really didn't want to feel that bad in the morning.  
他将她轻轻放下，为她盖上被子，并在她床边找了个小垃圾桶放好。最后看了一眼女孩，他转身离开，实在不想在早晨感到那么糟糕。_

"_Shinji…" he heard from behind him._  
“真嗣…”他听到身后传来声音。

"_Yeah?" Shinji turned._ “嗯？”真嗣转过身来。

"_You're leaving…"_ "你要走了…"

_Of course, she'd want him to stay.  
当然，她希望他能留下。_

"_Alright," he said, walking back to her and sitting at the base of the bed. Her one hand crept out from the covers to reach for him, and he squeezed it back ever so slightly, earning a drunken grin from the girl._  
"好吧，"他说着，走回她身边，坐在床边。她的一只手从被子里悄悄伸出，摸索着找他，他轻轻握住她的手，换来女孩醉意朦胧的微笑。

"_I'll stay right here Asuka."_  
"我会一直在这里，明日香。"

**Alright, yeah I'm late, sue me.  
好吧，是的，我迟到了，告我吧。**

**I'm not very knowledgeable about sake, nor the amount it takes to get someone messed up, but considering they're 14 I doubt it's that much, especially if it's strong stuff. Apparently its under 20 percent but hey, that'd be pretty potent to a 14 year old.  
我对清酒不太了解，也不知道要喝多少才能让人醉倒，但考虑到他们只有 14 岁，我怀疑不会太多，尤其是如果是烈酒的话。据说酒精度不到 20%，但嘿，对一个 14 岁的孩子来说，那已经相当厉害了。**

**SHOUTOUTS! 特别鸣谢！**

**EvaPilotFair – Thanks! EvaPilotFair – 感谢！**

**tomdj1701 – Souls? What souls?  
tomdj1701 – 灵魂？什么灵魂？**

BigBlueSmile11 – 谢谢！至于卡尔沃鲁……经历了这么多事，我想他不会站在真嗣的好一边了。**

**Berix – Haha, thanks! I'm happy to keep the chapters coming.  
Berix – 哈哈，谢谢！我很高兴继续推出新章节。**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – All in good time… though Fuyutsuki does have that talk with him…  
美国超旋风 – 一切都会在适当的时候…尽管冬月确实和他谈过…**

**SuperSandwichGoku- Thanks!  
超级三明治悟空- 谢谢！**

**NoseGum – Shinji's favorite pastime is digging a hole for himself lmao. Thanks!  
鼻胶 – 真嗣最喜欢的消遣就是给自己挖坑哈哈。谢谢！**

**YodaMorpheus7- "Misato didn't get that pony for her 5****th** **birthday, Ritsuko neglected her cats, there is no East Bunny, there is no Tooth Fairy, and there is no Queen of England!"**  
YodaMorpheus7- “Misato 五岁生日时没有得到那匹小马，Ritsuko 忽视了她的猫，没有东兔，没有牙仙，也没有英格兰女王！”

**dyinglittelstar- Perhaps Kaji told her and Misato ran with it, hmmmm?

**engel7white – thanks! engel7white – 谢谢！**

**Kegamer 9000 -Thanks for bingeing it haha, really happy you enjoyed it. As for Shinji's companions being there for real…. well, we'll just have to find out.  
Kegamer 9000 - 感谢你一口气看完哈哈，真的很高兴你喜欢。至于真嗣的伙伴们是否真的在场……嗯，我们只能拭目以待了。**

**JDH1080 – Thanks! Ghost Soryu is supposed to be based off OG NGE Soryu, and yes she wasn't there from the very beginning. As for Re-Take *Takes a moment to scream into the void*, contrary to popular belief I didn't even know Re-Take existed until I found myself on a certain Discord server, so… yeah… it's all very funny.  
JDH1080 – 谢谢！幽灵惣流的设计灵感来自原版《新世纪福音战士》中的惣流，而且她的确不是从一开始就在的。至于《Re-Take》*深吸一口气，对着虚空尖叫*，与普遍看法相反，我直到加入某个 Discord 服务器之前，甚至都不知道《Re-Take》的存在，所以……是的……这一切都非常有趣。**

**skyf0x – For most things if it's not explicitly changed in Rebuild I generally assume that it's like NGE, though that's just a rule of thumb. The EVA that came for Shinji is a bit different than in canon, we'll see just what's up with the strange 'liquid metal'.  
skyf0x – 对于大多数情况，如果在《Rebuild》中没有明确改动，我通常会默认它与《新世纪福音战士》（NGE）一致，不过这只是一条经验法则。来找真嗣的 EVA 与原作有些不同，我们将会看到这奇怪的“液态金属”究竟是怎么回事。**

**Shredjeep777 – Soryu did not kill Shinji, can confirm that, if I'm thinking of the same line, that was written with the idea that it hurts Shinji to have to see her revert back to square one every loop. Like he helps her move forwards only to have that reset every life.  
Shredjeep777 – 碇真嗣并未被惣流所杀，可以确认这一点。如果我指的是同一段话，那段描述是基于这样一个想法：每次循环中看到她回归原点，对真嗣来说是一种伤害。就像他帮助她向前迈进，却每次生命都重置一样。**

**Until Next Time. 下次再会。**


### Chapter 47: "…Leave you like a lonely solitaire…"  
Chapter 47: "…像一张孤独的单牌一样离开你…"

"ARGH!" "啊！"

The slamming of a door followed swiftly was with the shout, but she didn't care if anyone heard her, she just wanted to hit something.  
门砰然关闭，紧接着是一声怒吼，但她不在乎是否有人听到，她只想打点什么。

Her fists slammed against her sheet metal cabinet, leaving a small dent, and causing flashes of pain throughout her hands. Then, that anger that had boiled in her since seeing that boy in the hallway, that anger that had driven her to interrogation, that had simmered as she talked to him, it finally extinguished.  
她的拳头猛击在金属柜上，留下一个小凹痕，双手传来阵阵剧痛。随后，自从在走廊看到那个男孩以来一直沸腾的怒火，驱使她进行审问的怒火，与他对谈时仍未平息的怒火，终于熄灭了。

She turned, resting her back against the wall, and let herself slide down it till she was just sitting on the cold floor, letting her head rest back against the door.  
她转身，背靠墙壁，任由自己滑坐到冰冷的地板上，头靠在门上休息。

She had touched him; he had really been there. This wasn't some dream, Shinji Ikari was again part of this world.  
她曾触碰过他；他真的存在过。这并非一场梦境，碇真嗣再次成为了这个世界的一部分。

So why did that make her so angry?  
那么，为何这让她如此愤怒？

The answer was simple. Just when she thought it was over, the moment she thought she had found some semblance of closure, it was ripped away from her.  
答案很简单。就在她以为一切已经结束，以为自己找到了些许慰藉的时刻，这一切又被无情地夺走了。

Just like everything else in her life.  
就像她生活中的一切那样。

The girl pushed herself up slowly, looking around the room that had become her 'home'. The sparse quarters were more spacious than most accommodations, a desk, and locker, with a full bed too. The shelves next to the bed holding plenty of things from her life.  
女孩缓缓起身，环顾这个已成为她“家”的房间。这间简朴的住所比大多数住处都要宽敞，有一张书桌、一个储物柜，还有一张大床。床边的架子上摆满了她生活中的各种物品。

Walking over she just looked at the raggedy old doll that had been collecting dust for so long. One side was charred, blackened by the events surrounding the 9th Angel. While over the left side of its face, a crudely cut black cloth imitated an eyepatch.  
她走过去，凝视着那个积满灰尘的破旧玩偶。玩偶的一侧被烧焦，留下了第九使徒事件的痕迹。而左脸部分，则用一块粗糙剪裁的黑布模仿着眼罩。

ʡʘʘʘʢ

"_These are your personal effects," an attendant said, placing the dusty bin in her lap._  
"这些是你的个人物品，"一位工作人员说道，将那个积满灰尘的箱子放在她腿上。

_The girl said nothing, she just stared at the box, while the woman proceeded to push her down the hall. Asuka said nothing as she was brought into a small officer's quarters or at least it appeared to be one. It was a bit more spacious than expected, but the girl could barely register that.  
女孩没有说话，只是盯着箱子，而那位女士继续推着她沿着走廊前进。明日香一言不发地被带进了一个小型的军官宿舍，或者至少看起来像是。这里比预想的要宽敞一些，但女孩几乎没注意到这一点。_

"_Now Dr. Akagi will be here shortly to get you prepped."_  
"现在，赤木博士很快就会来帮你准备。"

_With that the woman left, leaving the girl alone with her thoughts.  
说完，女人便离开了，留下女孩独自沉思。_

_Four years. 四年。_

_She had been asleep for four years.  
她已经沉睡了四年。_

_Misato and Ritsuko hadn't said much after that, instead they let her leave, saying they would speak later. As if she wanted to talk about it later.  
自那以后，美里和律子没再多说什么，只是让她离开，说稍后再谈。仿佛她愿意之后再谈似的。_

_Asuka looked to the small desk that had been given her and slowly wheeled herself over to it. With only one arm and her severely weakened state, she managed to do it, but just barely, leaving herself breathing heavily and feeling a burning pain in her right arm. For a moment the girl almost felt like she was back in Germany undergoing hours of rigorous training to be selected as a pilot.  
明日香看向分配给她的小桌子，缓缓地将自己推过去。仅凭一只手臂和极度虚弱的身体，她勉强做到了，但只是勉强，让她气喘吁吁，右臂感到一阵灼痛。有那么一刻，女孩几乎觉得自己回到了德国，经历了数小时的严格训练，以被选为驾驶员。_

_But that was a long time ago.  
但那是很久以前的事了。_

_Flipping the box over, she dumped the contents out over the desk. A few pieces of clothing had been stuffed inside, but what had been on the very bottom drew her interest.  
她将盒子翻转过来，把里面的东西倒在桌上。几件衣物被塞在里面，但最底下的一样东西引起了她的兴趣。_

_Her prized possession. The doll that had been gifted her so long ago fell out onto the pile. Ignoring everything else, she picked it up and flipped it over. Instead of the pristine toy she remembered, the entire left side was horribly lacerated and charred nearly beyond recognition. Her eye looked over it, again and again, thinking about how she might save what was left.  
她的珍爱之物。那个许久以前被赠予她的玩偶从一堆杂物中掉了出来。她不顾其他，拾起它翻转过来。与记忆中完好无损的模样截然不同，整个左侧严重撕裂，几乎被烧得面目全非。她的目光一遍遍掠过，思索着如何挽救这残存的部分。_

_Setting it aside, she looked through what else had been dumped out over the table.  
她将那件东西搁置一旁，开始翻看桌上散落的其他物品。_

_The small bag she had brought with her to Unit-03's activation.  
她带到初号机启动现场的小包。_

_A few small items, a hairbrush, her makeup.  
几件小物品，一把梳子，她的化妆品。_

_Her original A10 clips…. and her Wunderswan.  
她最初的 A10 夹子……还有她的 Wonderswan 游戏机。_

_She eyed them, before setting them aside, unsure of what to do with them.  
她打量着它们，随后将它们搁置一旁，不确定该如何处理。_

_Then she spotted her phone.  
接着，她看到了她的手机。_

_Slowly she reached over, with the pendent still wrapped around her fingers seemed so much heavier now. Flipping it open, she powered it on, amazed that there was still a charge.  
她缓缓伸手过去，吊坠仍缠绕在指间，此刻却显得格外沉重。她翻开手机，启动电源，惊讶地发现居然还有电。_

_The screen flickered to life, showing the girl the picture, she had set as her background.  
屏幕闪烁着亮起，向女孩展示她设为背景的图片。_

_A sea of red and oranges lit up her eyes. The silhouetted figure of a scowling girl sat on the edge of a rooftop, with the backdrop of Tokyo-03 behind her.  
一片红橙色的海洋映入她的眼帘。一个面带怒容的女孩的剪影坐在屋顶边缘，背后是东京-03 的背景。_

"So, you never forget the memory, things fade, but you'll have that picture forever."  
“所以，你永远不会忘记这段记忆，事物会褪色，但你将永远拥有那张照片。”

_Somehow it all came crashing down on her in that moment, hearing those words echo in her mind.  
不知为何，那一刻所有的一切都如山崩般压向她，那些话语在脑海中回响。_

_He was gone. 他走了。_

_The only person who understood her was dead.  
唯一理解她的人已经不在了。_

_The girl barely registered the droplets falling onto her medical gown, pulling the pendant to her chest she couldn't hold back the tears now falling freely down her cheeks. How was this fair? Why did this have to happen to her? Why did everyone leave?  
女孩几乎没注意到水滴落在她的医疗服上，她将吊坠紧紧抱在胸前，泪水此刻已无法抑制地顺着脸颊滑落。这公平吗？为什么这种事要发生在她身上？为什么每个人都离开了？_

_Slowly and with a shaking hand, Asuka unwrapped the pendent from her fingers and tied it around her neck. Just clutching it, what little comfort she gained from it couldn't stop her tears. So she just sat there trying to process everything that had been happened.  
阿斯卡缓缓地用颤抖的手指解开吊坠，将其系在脖子上。仅仅是紧握着它，她从中获得的些许安慰也无法止住泪水。于是她只是坐在那里，试图消化所发生的一切。_

"Hey, wake up sleepy head."  
“嘿，醒醒，小懒虫。”

The girl's eyes fluttered open, revealing the rays of light coming through her window.  
女孩的眼帘轻轻颤动，缓缓睁开，阳光透过窗户洒入她的视野。

"Wha…" she sat up, her grogginess clouding her brain while feeling the weight of clothes being dropped on her.  
“什…”她坐起身，睡意朦胧中感到有衣物被扔到身上，大脑仍是一片混沌。

"C'mon, we're gonna be late for school." She knew that voice.  
“快点，我们上学要迟到了。”她熟悉这个声音。

Pushing herself upright, Asuka looked around. She was in her room, in her bed, where she could feel the warmth of Japan's endless summer in her bones.  
阿斯卡用力撑起身子，环顾四周。她正躺在自己的房间，自己的床上，能感受到日本无尽夏日的温暖深入骨髓。

"Shinji?" “真嗣？”

"Yes?" he said, turning, just before he was about to leave, seemingly to let her change.  
“什么事？”他转过身来，就在他即将离开，似乎是要让她换衣服的时候。

She jumped out of bed and ran up to him, wrapping her arms around him and crushing him with a hug. The girl wanted to latch onto him, to keep him as her anchor, her rock, and never let him leave.  
她跳下床，跑到他身边，双臂紧紧抱住他，用力拥抱。女孩想要紧紧抓住他，让他成为自己的锚，自己的磐石，永不让他离开。

"Hey what's that for?" "嘿，这是干嘛用的？"

"I had a dream…" she said, her words reassuring herself that it was only a dream.  
"我做了一个梦……" 她说，这些话让她自己确信那只是一个梦。

"That scary?" "那么可怕吗？"

"You were gone… everyone was gone."  
"你离开了……大家都离开了。"

"Hey, look at me…" he said, raising her chin so that she'd look at him.  
"嘿，看着我……" 他说着，抬起她的下巴，让她看向他。"

"Didn't I promise I'd never leave?"  
"我不是承诺过永远不会离开吗？"

She nodded, just letting his warm smile wash over her.  
她点点头，任由他温暖的笑容笼罩着自己。

"Alright, now get changed so we can go, I got some food in the kitchen before we walk to school."  
“好了，快换衣服，我们得出发了。我在厨房准备了些吃的，等会儿去学校的路上吃。”

Asuka cautiously let go of him, before he slipped through the sliding door, leaving her alone in the room. Walking over to the bed, she sighed before picking up the clothes and hanging them next to her mirror.  
明日香小心翼翼地松开了他，在他滑过推拉门离开后，房间里只剩下她一人。她走到床边，叹了口气，然后拿起衣服，挂在了镜子旁边。

Looking at it, she saw the unmarred face of Asuka Langley Shikinami. No bandages, no sunken skin, just her.  
她凝视着那张脸，那是未经任何修饰的式波·明日香·兰格雷的面庞。没有绷带，没有凹陷的皮肤，只有她原本的样子。

Sighing in relief she took off her shirt to get dressed, only to feel a weight fall against her chest.  
她松了一口气，脱下衬衫准备换衣服，却感到胸前突然一沉。

A Greek Cross, hanging lazily from around her neck.  
一个希腊十字架，慵懒地悬挂在她的脖子上。

Suddenly the mirror cracked, leaving half her image distorted as her entire figure began to cloud over, leaving behind only a black silhouette.  
突然间，镜子裂开了，她的一半影像变得扭曲，整个身形开始云雾缭绕，最终只留下一个黑色的剪影。

"Asuka?" “明日香？”

"_Asuka?" the unmistakable voice of Ritsuko asked, waking her up._  
“明日香？”律子那不容错辨的声音问道，将她唤醒。

"_Yes?" she grumbled._ “嗯？”她咕哝着回应。

"_It's time."_ "是时候了。"

_Asuka said nothing as the doctor wheeled her from the room, through the halls, and into some sort of medical room. An exam table sat on one side, while the other was occupied by a cylindrical tank of LCL.  
明日香一言不发，任由医生推着她穿过房间，沿着走廊，进入了一间医疗室。一边摆放着检查台，另一边则是一个装满 LCL 的圆柱形水槽。_

"_We're going run some tests, and we'll also start work on your rehabilitation."_  
"我们要进行一些测试，同时也会开始你的康复训练。"

_Asuka nodded, allowing the woman to help her onto the examination table, lying there, she shivered from the cool material but said nothing.  
明日香点点头，任由那位女士扶她上了检查台，躺下后，她因冰凉的材质而微微颤抖，却一言未发。_

"_I'm going to remove the bandages on your left side, alright?"_  
“我要拆掉你左侧的绷带了，好吗？”

_Again the girl just nodded as the blonde began to work down at her leg.  
女孩再次只是点头，金发女子开始在她腿上操作。_

_The hospital gown they had her in was gently pushed out of the way. Gauze and bandages seemed to plaster her side, caking every bit of skin. She just looked down at the doctor as she came to her hip, but said nothing as she continued her work all the way to her shoulder.  
她身上的医院病号服被轻轻推开。纱布和绷带似乎贴满了她的侧身，每一寸皮肤都沾满了药膏。她只是低头看着医生一路检查到她的臀部，再至肩膀，全程一言不发。_

_Asuka shouldn't have been suppressed at the sight, but the sheer amount of scarring she saw was beyond what she could have ever imagined.  
看到这一幕，明日香本不该感到压抑，但那遍布全身的疤痕数量之多，超出了她的想象。_

_Ritsuko must have noticed her look and returned on of pity, "Once we got you out of Unit-03's entry plug you were in bad shape. I honestly didn't think you'd survive; I don't think anyone did. How you managed to pull through is beyond me, if it had been anyone else …"  
律子一定注意到了她的表情，回以一个同情的眼神，“当我们把你从三号机的插入栓里救出来时，你的状况非常糟糕。老实说，我真没想到你能挺过来；我想没人这么认为。你究竟是如何熬过来的，我实在无法理解，换作别人……”_

_Asuka tuned her out, just looking at the lines of pale skin that zig-zagged across her figure. When Ritsuko finally pulled all the bandages from her arm, the skin looked shrivled and lumpy, a far cry from the smooth perfection she had taken such pride in.  
明日香对她置若罔闻，只是盯着那些在她身上蜿蜒曲折的苍白肌肤。当律子终于将她手臂上的绷带全部解开时，那皮肤显得皱缩而凹凸不平，与她曾引以为傲的光滑完美相去甚远。_

"_Don't worry too much. We were able to set the bones years ago, and you'll likely regain full motor functions. Plus, when you gain back some weight, I'm sure it'll look better." Ritusko said optimistically, before taking out a stethoscope and placing the cool metal against her skin._  
"别太担心。几年前我们已经把骨头接好了，你很可能会恢复全部的运动功能。而且，等你体重恢复一些，我相信看起来会好很多。" 律子乐观地说道，随后拿出听诊器，将冰凉的金属贴在她的皮肤上。

"_There's something else…" the doctor said, finishing her reading._  
"还有别的事情……" 医生说完，结束了检查。

"_What?"_ “什么？”

"_Your eye… we don't know if it'll have any function, but it won't matter, you'll be required to wear this." She said, pulling out something from her lab coat._  
"你的眼睛…我们不确定它是否还有功能，但没关系，你需要戴上这个。" 她说着，从她的实验服里拿出一样东西。

_Squinting, Asuka realized what it was, a grey eyepatch with a multitude of scribbles on it, runes probably. The blonde gingerly slipped it over her head and began to remove the bandages underneath.  
眯起眼睛，明日香意识到那是什么，一个灰色的眼罩，上面布满了潦草的涂鸦，可能是符文。金发女孩小心翼翼地把它套在头上，开始拆下下面的绷带。_

"_Why?" Asuka asked, not fully understanding the reasoning behind it._  
"为什么？" 明日香问，不完全明白背后的原因。

"_We believe there's Angelic contamination concentrated there, we don't know exactly what it is, but at the very least this will help keep it from spreading." the blonde explained, "Now about this hair…"_  
“我们认为那里集中了某种天使污染，虽然具体是什么尚不清楚，但至少这能防止它扩散。”金发女子解释道，“现在来说说这头发……”

"_Cut it." Asuka said flatly._  
“停下。”明日香冷冷地说。

"_Are you sure? It'll have to be short."_  
"你确定吗？得简短些。"

"_I don't care."_ "我不在乎。"

"_Alright then, let's get you sitting."_  
"那好吧，我们让你坐下。"

_Asuka complied, allowing the doctor to help her into a sitting position, hissing at the effort it required of her. she hated this. All of this. She hated feeling so weak, unable to even sit upright easily without any help.  
明日香顺从地配合，让医生扶她坐起身，因这番努力而倒吸一口凉气。她痛恨这一切。所有的一切。她憎恶这种虚弱感，连轻松坐直都做不到，非得依赖他人帮助。_

_Shortly, the clipping sound of her hair being cut was the only noise between them as the girl felt the mass of hair slowly begin to dwindle.  
很快，剪刀剪断她头发的咔嚓声成了两人间唯一的声响，女孩感觉到那一大束头发正缓缓减少。_

"_So, you and Shinji?"_  "那么，你和真嗣？"

"_What about it?"_ "那又怎样？"

_The blonde shrugged, "It's just… you didn't seem to get along with him."  
金发少女耸了耸肩，"只是……你看起来和他相处得不太好。"_

_Asuka stayed quiet. 明日香保持沉默。_

"_How serious was it?"_ "有多严重？"

"_And why exactly do you want to know?" Asuka hissed, turning swiftly to see the woman just standing there with scissors in her hands._  
""你究竟为什么想知道？"" 明日香低声咆哮，迅速转身，只见那女人手持剪刀站在那里。

"_I'm… just trying to talk Asuka," he said, holding up her hands in defense._  
""我只是……想和你谈谈，明日香，"" 他说着，举起双手以示防御。

"_Well, save it," she hissed, while turning back around, "I'm sure Misato'll fill you in afterward anyway," she grumbled, annoyed that she had even told the doctor._  
"行了，省省吧，"她低声说道，转过身去，"我敢肯定事后美里会告诉你的，"她咕哝着，恼火自己竟然告诉了医生。

"_I don't think so."_ "我不这么认为。"

"_What was that?"_ "那是什么？"

"_Commander Katsuragi doesn't have ti… she's very busy." Ritsuko explained, "She has plenty of responsibilities occupying her time."_  
"葛城司令没有时间……她非常忙。" 律子解释道，"她有很多职责占据着她的时间。"

"_She'll make time," the girl said, a tone of certainty in her voice._  
"她会抽出时间的，" 女孩说，语气中带着确定性。"

"_I don't know about that Asuka."_  
"我不确定阿斯卡。"

"_Sure, just like you knew there wasn't an Angel in Unit-03."_  
"当然，就像你知道 03 号机里没有天使一样。"

"_You can't…"_ "你不能……"

"_Or that Gendo Ikari was going to try and kill us all!"_  
"或者像你知道碇源堂会试图杀死我们所有人一样！"

"_Christ! I only asked because she order…!" she barked back, before cutting herself off._  
"天哪！我只是问她为什么下令……！"她厉声回道，随即自己打住了话头。

"_What?"_ “什么？”

"_Nothing." The woman clammed up, unwilling to say another word._  
"没什么。"女人闭口不言，不愿再多说一个字。

_Misato had ordered her to ask about Shinji? No. She had ordered her to ask about their relationship.  
美里是让她询问关于真嗣的事吗？不。美里是让她询问他们之间的关系。_

_Why didn't she just ask herself?  
她为什么不直接问自己呢？_

_Another sense of irritation at the woman bubbled up inside her. What was the matter with Misato?  
对那个女人的恼怒感再次在她心中升起。美里到底怎么了？_

_She was brought out of her thoughts by Ritsuko handing her a small mirror. Taking it, Asuka was able to finally see herself fully, no hair covering her face, no bandages blocking half her view. Her hair had been cut back, now just barely reaching her shoulders, much shorter than she always wore it these days. Though, perhaps more striking was the fact she was sporting a rather ugly scar.  
理津子递给她一面小镜子，将她从思绪中拉回。接过镜子，明日香终于能完全看清自己了，脸上没有头发遮挡，也没有绷带遮住视线。她的头发被剪短了，现在只勉强到肩膀，比她平时留的要短得多。不过，更引人注目的是她脸上那道相当丑陋的疤痕。_

_And apart from all that…  
除了这一切之外……_

"_Why…"_ “为什么……”

"_Yes?"_ "什么事？"

"_Why don't I look…"_ "为什么我不显得……"

"_Older?" Ritsuko answered, a bit of irritation still lining her voice, "We believe it has to do with the Evangelions, another pilot has the same condition,"_  
"更老一些？" 律子回答道，声音中仍带着一丝不耐，"我们认为这与 EVA 有关，另一位驾驶员也有同样的情况。"

_Asuka brought her hand up to her face, touching it, not registering the mention of another pilot.  
明日香将手举到脸前，轻触着，对提及另一位驾驶员的事毫无反应。_

"_We don't know what other effects it might have, right now all we know is that you haven't been aging, aside from your hair growing you haven't changed."_  
“我们还不清楚它可能带来的其他影响，目前所知仅是你没有衰老，除了头发长长外，你没有任何变化。”

_Asuka just stared at her face, unable to say anything.  
明日香只是凝视着自己的脸庞，说不出一句话来。_

"_To start we'll submerge you in LCL, we can lessen the stress on your bones and left lung. It'll be easy, there's a treadmill and some handlebars, just take it easy..."_  
首先我们会将你浸入 LCL 中，这样可以减轻你骨骼和左肺的压力。很简单，里面有跑步机和扶手，放松就好...

_The girl tuned her out, and just stared at the reflection, touching her face as a soft blue glow emanated from the eyepatch.  
女孩没理她，只是盯着镜子中的自己，轻轻触摸着脸庞，眼罩发出柔和的蓝光。_

ʡʘʘʘʢ

Misato Katuragi hated these meetings.  
葛城美里讨厌这些会议。

In all honesty, they felt more like interrogations than anything. It was either her begging for more supplies and support or them demanding information and action.  
老实说，这些会议更像是审讯而非其他。要么是她乞求更多的物资和支持，要么是他们要求信息和行动。

Standing in front of the five faces, she wanted nothing more than to wrangle the majority of their necks for their aura of superiority.  
站在五张面孔前，她最想做的就是扭断他们大多数人的脖子，以消除他们那种优越的气场。

"Commander," the second face to the left greeted.  
“指挥官，”左边第二张脸打了个招呼。

"Vice-chairman." She greeted back.  
“副主席。”她回礼道。

He was an older gentle, with a receding hairline that was devoid of color, in a way he almost reminded her of Fuyutsuki, though he had a much more filled out figure than the slender aging man she had known.  
他是一位年长的绅士，发际线后退，头发毫无颜色，某种程度上让她想起了冬月，尽管他的身材比她所认识的那位瘦削的老人要丰满得多。

"Sensors in Anchorage detected a massive energy spike North of the Bearing Sea hours ago," he stated, his face clearly accusing her of the obvious, "it very much resembles the simulated activation of _Wunder._"  
"数小时前，安克雷奇的传感器检测到白令海以北出现了巨大的能量峰值，"他陈述道，脸上明显流露出对她的责备之意，"这与 Wunder 的模拟激活极为相似。"

"That's because _Wunder_ is currently underway on her own power," Misato replied, a bit of pride creeping into her voice.  
"那是因为 Wunder 正依靠自身动力运行，"美里回答，声音中不自觉地带上了几分自豪。"

"The activation wasn't scheduled until a week from now, and that was a very optimistic estimate." This time the speaker was on the far right, a middle-aged woman whose face held more than her fair share of wrinkles.  
"激活本应在一周后进行，那已经是非常乐观的估计了。"这次发言的是最右边的一位中年妇女，她的脸上布满了皱纹。"

"Yes, that's correct, but NERV attacked our position, we couldn't escape, so I gave the order to activate the ignition procedure."  
"是的，没错，但 NERV 攻击了我们的位置，我们无法逃脱，所以我下令启动点火程序。"

"Don't you think that was a bit reckless?"  
"你不觉得那有点鲁莽吗？"

"Considering the options, we had at the time were limited, no, I saw that was the best avenue available to me."  
"考虑到当时我们有限的选项，不，我认为那是当时我能采取的最佳途径。"

"So, what is your operational capacity right now then?"  
"那么，你们目前的作战能力如何？"

"Currently we're assessing just that, we were able to destroy the Mark 4s sent at us, but this ship needs to be evaluated first. There are plenty of systems that are not operating properly."  
"目前我们正在评估这一点，我们成功摧毁了来袭的 Mark 4 型机器人，但这艘船需要先进行全面检查。许多系统都未能正常运作。"

"Then we'll expect to be kept informed on the statue of 'the god slayer' commander. You are in possession of the only true S2 engine ever create, I hope you understand the gravity of your situation."  
"那么我们期待能随时了解‘弑神者’指挥官的状况。你掌握着唯一真正创造出的 S2 引擎，希望你明白自己处境的严重性。"

"That is not lost on me."  
"这一点我并未忽视。"

None of the council members said anything, instead, the immediate member to the right flicked something onto his screen.  
议会成员们无一开口，反倒是坐在右边的那位立刻在屏幕上轻点了一下。

"As we last discussed, our foothold in England has been… lackluster." The man said as a picture of the English Isles appeared on the screen. Nearly all of the main island was red, save for a small section of blue to the north.  
""正如我们上次讨论的，我们在英格兰的立足点一直……不尽人意。"" 那人边说边让英格兰群岛的图像出现在屏幕上。几乎整个主岛都呈现红色，只有北部一小块区域是蓝色。

"Last week the order to evacuate the remainder of our forces was given after the main Purification Pillar suffered a malfunction."  
"上周，在我们主净化柱发生故障后，撤离剩余部队的命令被下达了。"

Misato watched as the blue was slowly pushed back until finally red encompassed the entirety of the island.  
美里看着蓝色逐渐被逼退，直到最后红色覆盖了整个岛屿。

"It was expected something like this would happen, the whole expedition actually accomplished more than we expected." The furthest member to the left commented.  
"这种情况在意料之中，实际上整个远征取得的成果超出了我们的预期。" 最左边的成员评论道。"

"And the Second-Generation JA models performed admirably, the preproduction units of the Mark III are predicted to be even more capable."  
第二代 JA 系列车型表现出色，预生产的 Mark III 型号预计将更加强大。

"Were NERV forces encountered at all?" Misato asked.  
“NERV 的部队有遭遇吗？”美里问道。

"No," the woman responded, "only Wanderers, though we learned quite a bit from fighting them. Namely, they are particularly resilient to our current firepower.  
“没有，”女子回答，“只遇到了流浪者，不过从与他们的战斗中我们学到了不少。主要是，他们对我们的现有火力特别有抵抗力。”

Misato could have told them that, it wasn't like she had been dealing with them for years now.  
美里本可以告诉他们这一点，毕竟她与他们打交道已有多年。

A silence fell over the group before someone asked whether there was any more business to conduct. Taking the silence as their answer all the screens flickered off, except for one. The center vertical view of the Supreme Commander of all Alliance forces sat there; hands folded.  
一阵沉默笼罩了众人，随后有人询问是否还有事务需要处理。将沉默视作回答，所有屏幕逐一熄灭，唯有一块例外。联盟军最高指挥官的中央垂直视图静坐其上，双手交叠。

He was a rather unsuspecting man, bald, and with not a hint of facial hair. For a moment both of them just stared at one another, before he sighed and frowned.  
他是个相当不设防的男人，秃顶，脸上没有一丝胡须的痕迹。两人对视片刻，他才叹了口气，皱起眉头。

"I specifically withheld certain… information from the other council members," he said simply, his deep foreboding voice resonating from whatever sound system was installed in the room. "Very few people know about the current… situation surrounding Shinji Ikari."  
"我特意向其他议会成员隐瞒了某些……信息，"他简单地说道，他那深沉不祥的声音从房间里安装的任何音响系统中传出。"很少有人知道围绕碇真嗣的当前……情况。"

"Then I'll thank you for that sir," she said, feeling a flood of relief knowing she the other members wouldn't be questioning her later.  
"那么，我为此感谢您，先生，"她说，感到一阵释然，知道其他成员稍后不会质疑她。"

"However, I'd like an update."  
"然而，我希望得到最新进展。"

She took a deep breath, readying herself for the long-winded explanation and the reprimand she was going to get.  
她深吸一口气，准备好迎接冗长的解释和即将到来的责备。

"He woke up sir. He seemed confused, or dazed, he escaped custody but was eventually recaptured and brought to interrogation."  
“先生，他醒了。看起来有些困惑或恍惚，他逃脱了看管，但最终被重新抓获并带到了审讯室。”

"He escaped custody?" “他逃脱了看管？”

"Yes, _Wunder_ is barely combat capable, there's plenty of subsystems that are not fully operational. But he was brought in for questioning."  
"是的，Wunder 几乎无法进行战斗，许多子系统都未完全运作。但他被带来接受审问。"

"And?" "然后呢？"

"It was inconclusive, we're not sure if his mental state is undamaged, but…"  
"结果尚无定论，我们不确定他的精神状态是否完好，但是…"

"But what?" "但是什么？"

"He was taken… an EVA was able to retrieve him."  
"他被带走了……一台 EVA 成功救回了他。"

"I see." "我明白了。"

"I'd like it to be known that he wasn't fully cooperative with it, I believe he didn't want to go."  
"我希望声明，他对此并不完全配合，我相信他并不想离开。"

The man frowned, Misato wasn't sure if this was a test or not, but she wasn't going to risk lying to him.  
男人皱起了眉头，美里不确定这是否是一个考验，但她不打算冒险对他撒谎。

"What are your personal thoughts on the boy?"  
"你对这个男孩的个人看法是什么？"

"I don't believe I should be voicing my own feelings, sir. This isn't personal."  
"我认为我不该表达自己的感受，先生。这不是私人问题。"

"Katsuragi," he brought his hand up to rub his eyes, "We both know that's not true. Trust me, if half the intelligence on the boy's relationship with his father is true then in the grand scheme of this war that boy is not worth this council's time."  
"桂木，" 他抬起手揉了揉眼睛，"我们都知道那不是真的。相信我，如果关于那孩子与他父亲关系的情报有一半是真的话，那么在这场战争的大局中，那孩子不值得我们议会浪费时间。"

"It's not personal," she reassured again.  
"这不是私人问题，" 她再次安慰道。"

"I assure you, you're not the only commanding officer who's deal with something like this, so don't bother trying to hide it. Let me tell you from experience nothing good comes of it. As a matter of respect, I'll let you handle this yourself for as long as I can, but I don't believe time is on our side."  
"我向你保证，你不是唯一一个处理这类事情的指挥官，所以别费心去隐瞒了。根据我的经验，这样做不会有好结果。出于尊重，我会尽可能让你自己处理这件事，但我感觉时间并不站在我们这边。"

"What are you saying?" "你在说什么？"

"With the Mark IIIs, we'll have the ability to strike beyond the Americas. The sentiment is that Europe is our number one priority, but… Gendo Ikari has been quiet for too long. I feel as though this is the quiet before the storm."  
"有了 Mark IIIs，我们将有能力打击美洲以外的目标。目前的首要任务是欧洲，但是……碇源堂已经沉默太久了。我感觉这像是暴风雨前的宁静。"

"Is every nation willing to commit to an offensive?" she asked.  
“每个国家都愿意承诺发起进攻吗？”她问道。

"Considering the US is the last remaining Security Council member with any physical nation? Yes, if they want to, it'll happen."  
"考虑到美国是唯一一个还拥有实体国家的安理会成员？是的，如果他们愿意，这事就会发生。"

She shook his head, even with the majority of the world uninhabitable, politics reigned supreme.  
她摇了摇头，即便世界大部分地区已无法居住，政治依然至高无上。

"Do you have anything else to add?"  
"你还有什么要补充的吗？"

"No sir." "不，先生。"

"Then, this meeting is adjourned," he said as the screen cut off, leaving her in darkness.  
"那么，会议到此结束，"他说着，屏幕随即关闭，留下她在黑暗中。

**So sorry about the wait, I'm kinda drowning in schoolwork, which is understandable, the semester has roughly a month left. Since that's the case, don't expect a lot until the second week of December. It's very likely I'll get bored, or procrastinate and finish up a chapter before then, but I'm trying to focus more on school right now.  
很抱歉让您久等了，我目前学业繁重，这可以理解，毕竟学期只剩下大约一个月。因此，在十二月的第二周之前，不要期待太多更新。我很可能会感到无聊或拖延，提前完成一篇chapter，但我现在正努力专注于学业。**

**As for the story itself, I'm going to try and pull back from flashbacks. For Asuka that's not really possible, we'll keep seeing her time before 3.0, but for Shinji there will only be necessary ones. I just don't want to have essentially 'flashback fatigue' or we're just spinning our wheels not moving forwards with the story.  
至于故事本身，我打算减少闪回的使用。对于明日香来说，这不太可能完全避免，我们会继续看到她在 3.0 之前的时间，但对于真嗣，只会有必要的闪回。我只是不想让读者感到‘闪回疲劳’，或者我们只是在原地打转，没有推动故事向前发展。**

**SHOUTOUTS! 特别鸣谢！**

**SheriffJohnStone- Thanks!  
SheriffJohnStone- 谢谢！**

**EvaPilotFair – Lewd hand holding? I think we can get more of that.  
EvaPilotFair – 下流的手牵手？我觉得我们可以多来点。**

**YodaMorpheu7 – 'Walls of Jericho' Moment haha. I think Shinji's pretty fluent in Asukanese by now though, it's the 'doing everything she says without question' part that's the problem.  
YodaMorpheu7 – 哈哈，这就像是“耶利哥之墙”时刻。不过我觉得真嗣现在对“明日香语”已经相当流利了，问题在于他总是无条件地执行她说的每一件事。**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – You're assuming Gendo Ikari can feel anything in the first place lol.  
美利坚的 UltraSpink——你这是默认碇源堂首先能感受到什么情感呢，哈哈。**

**Gyugya16 – SHHH! Don't give it away. Haha, yeah I love it when small details like that get realized.  
Gyugya16 – 嘘！别剧透。哈哈，没错，我喜欢这种小细节被实现的感觉。**

**Dyinglittelstar – Misato getting Star Warsed and losing a hand would be an interesting idea…  
Dyinglittelstar – 美里要是像《星球大战》里那样失去一只手，那会是个有趣的设定……**

**Fate-RWBY ODST – Thanks for the info!  
Fate-RWBY ODST – 感谢提供信息！**

**Berix – Thanks! Get some sleep!  
Berix – 谢谢！去睡会儿吧！**

**Xenile – Thanks! Xenile – 谢谢！**

**JDH1080 – Thanks, but remember to sleep haha. Yeah I actually haven't read a whole lot of EVA fanfics, I don't really look off of . I didn't know Re-Take existed till I was invited to the Asushin Discord server.  
JDH1080 – 谢谢，不过记得要睡觉哈哈。是的，我其实没读过很多 EVA 同人文，不太关注其他地方。直到被邀请加入 Asushin Discord 服务器，我才知道有《Re-Take》这部作品。**

**tomdj1701 – Ah my last response was to be a bit humorous, theorize away!  
tomdj1701 – 啊，我上次的回复有点幽默，尽情理论吧！**

**skyfox - I too feel like there was a bit of a missed opportunity for seeing Misato and Asuka's relationship. It's a movie and time is an issue, but it would have been nice after the elevator conversation. The whole aspect of him remembering this is that this was the first time he confessed/told anyone about his situation (even if he was drunk or it wasn't remembered in the morning) but its also something I don't really see played with that much. Asuka would totally sneak alcohol from Misato as a mischievous 14 year old who thinks they're an adult, plus German/Europe's drinking age is lower, so its safe to assume she's had some before.  
skyfox - 我也觉得电影中错过了一些展现美里和明日香关系的机会。毕竟这是电影，时间有限，但在电梯对话之后有所展现会很好。他记得这件事的整个方面在于，这是他第一次向任何人坦白/讲述自己的情况（即使他当时喝醉了或者第二天不记得了），但这点并没有被过多地探讨。明日香作为一个调皮的 14 岁少女，肯定会从美里那里偷酒喝，认为自己已经是个大人了，再加上德国/欧洲的饮酒年龄较低，所以可以安全地假设她之前已经喝过一些。**

**calborghete – Thanks!  calborghete – 谢谢！**

**Guest – I'd actually agree.  
Guest – 我其实也同意。**

**Guest(2) – Haha, here it is.  
客人(2) – 哈哈，找到了。**

**NoseGum – Thanks! NoseGum – 感谢！**

**IllusoryMist (all) – Thanks for reading through it! Glad you've been enjoying it so far!  
IllusoryMist（所有）——感谢您的阅读！很高兴您到目前为止一直喜欢它！**

**Doc1012 – Thanks! I think at his core Shinji Ikari is still Shinji Ikari. He had brave moments in NGE, saving Asuka in Magma Diver, going and rushing to help Rei from Unit-00. So he had that capacity its just 'flourished' now, but at the same time, he forgot to learn all the lessons of EoE.  
Doc1012 ——谢谢！我认为碇真嗣的核心仍然是碇真嗣。他在《新世纪福音战士》中有过勇敢的时刻，比如在岩浆潜行中救出明日香，冲去帮助从零号机中救出绫波丽。所以他有这种能力，只是现在‘绽放’了，但与此同时，他忘记了学习《真心为你》中的所有教训。**

**Engel17white- Engel17white——**

**borisd34 – Thanks! borisd34 – 谢谢！**

**gyugya16 (2) – Remember Shinji didn't know that EVAs would 'evolve'. Shinji thinks this world (so far) is playing by NGE rules. Like I said very early on, Shinji's knowledge is almost a hinderance here, it'll come back to bite him.  
gyugya16 (2) – 记住，真嗣不知道 EVA 会‘进化’。真嗣认为这个世界（目前为止）是按照《新世纪福音战士》的规则运作的。就像我早先说的，真嗣的知识在这里几乎成了阻碍，这迟早会让他吃苦头。**

**Lupskillz – Hugging? In my story? What kind of degenerate do you take me for? (also yes)  
Lupskillz – 拥抱？在我的故事里？你把我当成什么人了？（不过确实有）**

**Guest (3) – Here we go!  
Guest (3) – 开始了！**

**kempn200252 – THANKS! kempn200252 – 谢谢！**

**Alright hope you all enjoyed this.  
希望你们都喜欢这个。**

**Until Next Time. 下次再会。**


### Chapter 48: "…I'm traveling through this world of woe …"  
Chapter 48: "…我正穿越这苦难的世界…"

Shinji's eye's blinked open to the sight of his fist having been caught.  
真嗣的眼睛眨了眨，映入眼帘的是自己的拳头被抓住的景象。

"Please do not do that again." Rei, no this wasn't Rei, said.  
“请不要再那样做了。”丽，不，这不是丽，说道。

After she released his fist, Shinji looked around accepting the fact he must've been sleepwalking, but that was the least of his concerns. Realizing he was standing on a catwalk, he looked around, it looked like the Evangelion's cages, but it was… run down.  
在她松开他的拳头后，真嗣环顾四周，接受了自己可能是在梦游的事实，但这已是他最不担心的问题。意识到自己正站在一个高架桥上，他四处张望，这里看起来像是 EVA 的牢笼，但……破败不堪。

His eyes were drawn to the Evangelion that had brought him here. He'd never seen anything like it before, it resembled Unit-00, with its one large eye and yellow paint job, but… it seemed bulkier.  
他的目光被带他来此的 EVA 吸引。他从未见过这样的东西，它与零号机相似，拥有一只大眼睛和黄色涂装，但……看起来更为笨重。

What he thought resembled Unit-00 was locked into a wall by itself, its arms and legs that were a strange metalic grey and white were anything but the familiar sight he knew of Unit-00, none of the appendages truly matched the torso in color.  
他以为那像是零号机的存在被独自锁在墙上，那些灰白相间的金属肢体与他所熟悉的零号机大相径庭，肢体颜色与躯干完全不匹配。

It became apparent why soon after, Shinji watched as the appendages began to melt, dripping at first then, turning to liquid, falling off the torso, leaving only rounded stubs as the 'liquid' fell into a pool at the base of the figure.  
不久后，原因变得显而易见，真嗣看着那些肢体开始融化，起初是滴落，随后化为液体，从躯干上脱落，只留下圆润的残端，而那些‘液体’则落入人形底部的水坑中。

Examining the room some more, he wondered where all the support crew was, it couldn't be all automation.  
他继续打量着房间，疑惑地想，所有的支持人员都去哪儿了，总不可能是全自动化的吧。

"_What a dump." Soryu grumbled._  
“真是个破地方。”草薙抱怨道。

She had a point, nearly every surface had some level of rust, while stress fractures worried him about the safety of even being here, and at any semblance of movement, the machinery whined in protest, signaling what he feared to be a catastrophic failure.  
她说的没错，几乎每个表面都锈迹斑斑，而那些应力裂缝让他担心待在这里的安全性，每当有一点动静，机械便发出抗议般的哀鸣，预示着他所担心的灾难性故障。

None of those fears were realized however as the walkways began to move, connecting the edge of the cages, with Rei standing at the edge, with no so much as an ounce of fear. Though it was Rei after all.  
然而，这些担忧并未成真，因为走道开始移动，连接起笼子的边缘，零站在边缘，没有丝毫恐惧。毕竟，她是零。

The pilot… Rei Ayanami… 这位驾驶员……绫波零……

Or at least it looked like Rei.  
或者至少看起来像绫波。

If it had been 10 years, then it had to be another clone, but why was she still young? Was this just a fresh batch?  
如果已经过去了十年，那么这一定是另一个克隆体，但她为何依然年轻？这只是新一批的克隆体吗？

"Follow me please." She called in a monotone voice as two figures appeared from the hallway that their catwalk had just been connected to.  
"请跟我来。" 她用单调的声音喊道，随即两个身影从刚刚与他们的天桥连接的走廊中出现。

"_Another me…" he heard the same voice say from behind him._  
"又一个我……" 他听到身后传来同样的声音说道。

"_Wondergirl, please tell me you know you're a clone!" Asuka grumbled._  
"小巫女，拜托告诉我你知道自己是个克隆体！" 明日香咕哝着。

"_I am the Ayanami series…"_  
"我是绫波系列……"

Shinji ignored their bickering as he walked apprehensively towards the group, eyeing the security guards. Clad in standard NERV security uniforms, they seemed rather normal, though with one crucial addition. A helmet covered their faces, a completely featureless helmet at that. It was simply one glossy oval-shaped piece at least from what Shinji could tell.  
真嗣无视他们的争吵，忐忑地走向人群，目光扫过保安。他们身着 NERV 标准保安制服，看起来相当普通，但有一个关键的不同之处。他们的脸被头盔遮住，那是一个完全无特征的头盔。从真嗣能看到的来看，它只是一个光滑的椭圆形部件。

As the two pilots passed them, one more detail stuck out to him. They were the same height.  
当两位驾驶员从他们身边经过时，还有一个细节引起了他的注意。他们的身高完全一致。

The exact same height. 完全相同的高度。

"Please do not stray," Not-Rei said as Shinji walked past the two guards. They continued deeper into the base, with Shinji doing his best to memorize wherever she was taking him. If this was NERV HQ, then it should be the medical wing if he wasn't mistaken.  
“请不要走散，”非-丽说道，当真嗣走过两名守卫时。他们继续深入基地，真嗣尽力记住她带他去的每一个地方。如果这是 NERV 总部，那么如果不是他弄错的话，应该是医疗翼。

Luckily it was, but again there was no one to meet them, instead, he followed her into a room which was baren except for one piece of machinery.  
幸运的是，确实如此，但再次没有人迎接他们，相反，他跟着她进入了一个空荡荡的房间，除了一个机器外别无他物。

It looked like a CAT scanner but vertical, two rings held by four vertical poles stood there, and he had a sinking feeling he was going to be asked to step inside.  
它看起来像一台 CAT 扫描仪，但却是垂直放置的，两个圆环由四根竖杆支撑着立在那里，他有种不祥的预感，自己将被要求踏入其中。

"Please enter, it is only to check your health after such a long time inside an EVA." The clone said slowly.  
“请进，只是为了检查你在 EVA 里待了这么久之后的健康状况。”克隆人缓缓说道。

Complying, Shinji cautiously stepped between the poles, figuring he didn't have much of a choice if he was a prisoner.  
顺从地，真嗣小心翼翼地跨过杆子，心想既然是囚犯，也没什么选择的余地。

Though no escorts had followed them…  
尽管没有人跟随他们……

The machine came to life, and the two rings ran up and down the vertical supports, lighting up and causing him to squint, but only for a moment. As soon as it arrived it was gone, just leaving him confused.  
机器启动了，两道光环在垂直支架上来回穿梭，亮光让他不禁眯起了眼，但仅是一瞬。它刚出现便消失无踪，只留下他一脸困惑。

Not-Rei walked up to him, seemingly as if nothing happened, and held out a rectangular device.  
非-丽走到他面前，仿佛什么都没发生过一样，递给他一个长方形装置。

"Um…" “呃……”

"This is for your safety," She explained, "Please keep it on you at all times."  
“这是为了你的安全，”她解释道，“请随时带在身上。”

"What exactly is it?" he asked, flipping it around and examining it. Only a row of lights appeared at the top, with no markings of any kind.  
“这到底是什么？”他问道，翻转着检查，只在顶部看到一排灯，没有任何标记。

"If it illuminates when entering an area, you must leave that place at once," she said, not elaborating. "Now, please follow me."  
"如果进入某个区域时它亮了，你必须立刻离开那个地方，" 她没有详细说明。"现在，请跟我来。"

Shinji shrugged and placed it in the breast pocket of the flight suit he was still wearing, it really had done wondering on the way here. Following the clone, they headed deeper into the facility.  
真嗣耸了耸肩，将它放入仍穿着的飞行服的胸袋中，它确实在来这里的路上引起了许多好奇。跟随克隆体，他们继续深入设施。

As they walked, Shinji began to feel a sense of déjà vu. In his stomach, he began to feel something he hadn't felt in a long time, in fact it was the same feeling he had when Misato had first brought him to the GeoFront.  
他们走着，真嗣开始感到一种似曾相识的感觉。在他的胃里，他开始感受到一种很久没有过的感觉，实际上，这与美里第一次带他去地底都市时的感觉如出一辙。

A sense of wonderment. 一种惊奇感。

Now laced with dread. 如今夹杂着恐惧。

Everything was new, as they walked each of the massive areas seemed degraded, rust and filth covered every surface, and behind each of them, a set of footprints was left in whatever had settled on the floor.  
一切都是新鲜的，他们走过每一个巨大的区域，似乎都显得破败不堪，锈迹和污垢覆盖了每一处表面，而他们身后，则留下了一串串印在地板上积尘中的足迹。

Finally, this Rei brought him to a trolley car and the rickety ride he found himself on was a stark contrast to the smooth experience he always remembered. As they crossed into the GeoFront his eyes shot wide.  
最终，这个丽带他来到了一辆有轨电车前，他发现自己乘坐的这辆摇摇晃晃的车与以往记忆中平稳的体验形成了鲜明对比。当他们穿过进入地表层时，他的眼睛瞪得大大的。

The dome that had sealed it underground was gone, and the clear blue sky was left bare for him to see. He had only ever seen such a sight during desperate times when fighting other Evangelions and doing his best to prevent annihilation, but here it was.  
曾经封闭在地下的穹顶已经消失，取而代之的是一览无余的清澈蓝天。他只在绝望时刻，与其它 EVA 战斗并竭力阻止毁灭时，才见过这样的景象，但现在它就在眼前。

The walls that were left of the dome held a crimson color, like the rock itself had been painted red, while the crater-filled 'ground' held no such strange colors.  
穹顶残留的墙壁呈现出深红色，仿佛岩石本身被染成了红色，而布满弹坑的‘地面’则没有这种奇异的色彩。

The tram went deeper, sliding down on the edge of the wall and further down into what would be the beginnings of Central Dogma. Finally stopped, Shinji followed the girl into a massive expanse, with no light to fight back the dark emptiness before his eyes, but based on memory, Shinji thought it had to be the storage space they had kept all the failed Unit-00 prototypes.  
电车继续深入，沿着墙壁边缘滑下，逐渐进入中央教条区的雏形。最终停下时，真嗣跟着女孩走进了一个巨大的空间，眼前一片漆黑，没有任何光线能驱散这空旷的黑暗，但根据记忆，真嗣认为这一定是他们存放所有失败零号机原型的地方。

That was until the lights finally came on.  
直到灯光终于亮起。

Shinji could barely comprehend the sight before him.  
真嗣几乎无法理解眼前所见的景象。

The room was certainly large enough to be what he thought it was, but instead of rows upon rows of failed Evangelions, a massive dome structure stood there instead, with countless pipes, tubes, and connections sprouting out of it like overgrown brush.  
这房间确实足够大，足以符合他的猜测，但映入眼帘的并非一排排失败的 EVA 机体，而是一个巨大的穹顶结构，无数管道、管线和连接器从其上蔓延而出，宛如丛生的灌木。

And painted on the side, the number '13' stood out in bright red.  
而在侧面，鲜红的数字‘13’格外醒目。

"This is Evangelion Unit-13." A voice rang out from the darkness.  
“这是 EVA 十三号机。”一个声音从黑暗中响起。

He knew it all too well.  
他对此再清楚不过了。

On a platform above him, Gendo Ikari appeared as a spotlight activated right over him. Shinji noted the familiar feeling of his father 'welcoming' him to NERV, though the visor now covering his eyes and the full beard in leu of the chinstrap did cause him some surprise.  
在他上方的高台上，碇源堂随着一束聚光灯的亮起而现身。真嗣感受到父亲‘欢迎’他来到 NERV 的熟悉感觉，尽管现在遮住眼睛的面罩和取代了下巴胡须的全脸胡须确实让他有些惊讶。

In all, Gendo Ikari never could help being dramatic.  
总之，碇源堂总是免不了要戏剧化一番。

"You will share this Unit with your co-pilot." He said as a spotlight activated behind the boy.  
"你将与你的副驾驶共享这个单元。" 他说着，一束聚光灯在男孩身后亮起。

Turning, Shinji's eyes met a pair of red. Kaworu Nagisa stood there, flashing a slim smile at the boy, who only returned a deep frown.  
转身之际，真嗣的目光与一双红色眼眸相遇。渚薰站在那里，向少年展露一抹浅笑，而真嗣只是回以深深的皱眉。

"When the time comes, the two of you will pilot the EVA." Gendo stated, causing Shinji to turn back to him, "This talk is over."  
“时机一到，你们两人将驾驶 EVA。”源堂如此宣布，令真嗣转回视线，“谈话结束。”

Well… it looked like he didn't even have a choice this time… interesting. That man was in for a rude awakening.  
好吧……看来这次他连选择的余地都没有了……有趣。那个人可要大吃一惊了。

ʡʘʘʘʢ

"The scan confirmed your suspicions." Fuyutsuki's voice reverberated through the ruined halls as they walked.  
"扫描结果证实了你的猜疑。" 他们走在废墟遍布的走廊上，冬月的话语在其中回荡。

"Finally Unit-13 will be completed, Project Wanyūdō will be on schedule once again." Gendo stated, as he effortlessly navigating the debris and rubble lining the hall, "And SEELE's child will be dealt with as well."  
“终于，13 号机即将完工，‘人类补完计划’也将重回正轨。” 碇源堂说道，他轻松地穿梭在走廊上散落的碎片和瓦砾中，“而 SEELE 的棋子也将被处理掉。”

"Quite a few birds for just one stone." the elderly man commented, groaning as his old joints tried to traverse the same obstructions.  
“一石多鸟啊。” 老人评论道，他那老化的关节在试图越过同样的障碍时发出呻吟。

Neither of them said a word for some time, simply walking, before finally reaching the end of their path. The hallway was ripped away, leaving only the expanse of the ruined GeoFront before them, without so much as a window to shield them from the periodic gusts of wind.  
他们沉默了一段时间，只是默默地走着，最终到达了路的尽头。走廊被撕裂开来，只剩下他们面前破败的第三新东京市，连一块遮挡风沙的窗户都没有。

"Are you going to speak with him?" Fuyutsuki asked. He knew the answer, but he figured trying once more would be warranted.  
"你要去和他谈谈吗？" 冬月问道。他知道答案，但他认为再试一次也无妨。

"No." a cold voice responded, "There is no point."  
"不。" 一个冷冰冰的声音回答，"没有意义。"

"And what about the topic I brought up? Have you had time to dwell on it?" the man asked.  
"那我提到的话题呢？你有没有时间仔细考虑一下？" 那人问道。

Gendo said nothing, just looking out over the cratered landscape for a few moments.  
源堂一言不发，只是凝视着那片满目疮痍的大地，沉默良久。

"I have," he confirmed "but I find no utility in it. The MAGI have calculated a null percent chance of it being true. It has no bearing on the scenario. We will speak no further on this matter."  
“我确实考虑过，”他确认道，“但我发现它毫无用处。MAGI 系统计算出其真实性为零概率。它对当前情况没有影响。我们不再讨论此事。”

With that, he promptly turned and left the elder by himself. Fuyutsuki's mind swirled, unable to comprehend what had just been said to him. Not relevant? What else could be so impactful?  
说完，他便果断转身离去，留下老者独自一人。冬月的心中波涛汹涌，无法理解刚刚被告知的一切。无关紧要？还有什么能如此震撼人心？

The evidence was screaming to them. Dr. Katsuragi's notes described this situation. While the man had been full of colorful theories, each more impossible than the last, they were working with the notion that at least one of his ideas had been correct. It was truly a possibility and one Fuyutsuki wouldn't let go. In an already insane world, why couldn't this too be possible?  
证据在他们耳边呼啸。碇博士的笔记描述了这种情况。尽管这个男人满脑子都是五彩斑斓的理论，一个比一个离奇，但他们正在基于至少有一个想法是正确的这一假设进行工作。这确实是一种可能性，而冬月不会轻易放弃。在一个本已疯狂的世界里，为什么这一点就不能成为可能呢？

Twice now the last remnants of Yui had seemingly been killed. Twice the flame extinguished from this world and twice had it been left that much darker.  
两次了，唯的最后遗迹似乎都被消灭了。两次，这世界的火焰被熄灭，两次，世界变得更加黑暗。

And yet… 然而……

Twice it had returned to them, twice it had seemingly been resurrected and he would not ignore that, no matter how much the boy's own father might.  
它两次回到他们身边，两次似乎都复活了，无论那男孩的亲生父亲如何忽视，他都不会对此视而不见。

So, he too turned and let his elderly knees take him back into the headquarters. Once again, the man was forced to only go deeper. He would talk with the child himself and get the answers he deserved.  
于是，他也转身，让年迈的膝盖带他回到总部。再一次，这个人被迫只能深入探寻。他要亲自与那孩子交谈，得到他应得的答案。

God help them if he was right.  
如果他是对的，愿上帝帮助他们。

ʡʘʘʘʢ

He had to admit, this was the blandest living quarters he had even had the 'privilege' of calling home. Even with all the run-down or absolutely disgusting places that he had laid his head, they at least had a bit of character and he'd take that over unfeeling blank walls any day.  
他不得不承认，这是他有幸称之为家的最乏味的居住环境。即便他曾睡过的那些破败不堪或绝对令人作呕的地方，至少还带点特色，他宁愿选择那些有性格的，也不愿面对毫无生气的空白墙壁。

The food at least showed promise, as long as it wasn't drugged. Shinji figured he'd find out soon enough. When he didn't fall into unconsciousness, he found himself leaving the room, fully expecting to be set upon by legions of guards, only to find… no one.  
至少食物看起来还有点希望，只要没被下药。真嗣想，他很快就会知道了。当他没有陷入昏迷时，他发现自己离开了房间，满心以为会被大批卫兵袭击，结果却发现……空无一人。

"_Well, it's not the worst place we've stayed, at least it isn't too boring," Soryu commented, he wasn't sure if it was sarcastic or not, sure no two piles of rubble were the same, but it was really starting to feel like it._  
“好吧，这里至少不是我们住过的最糟糕的地方，还算不上太无聊，”Soryu 评论道，他不确定这是不是在讽刺，确实没有两堆废墟是一样的，但真的开始感觉越来越像了。

Wandering the halls, he could clearly tell this was not the GeoFront he knew. Crude patches to infrastructure and loose or straight-up dangerous cabling would have made a certain doctor he hated have a heart attack.  
在走廊间徘徊，他清晰地察觉到这并非他所熟悉的地底都市。基础设施的粗糙修补和松散乃至明显危险的电缆布置，足以让某个他深恶痛绝的医生心脏病发。

"_This is not right." Rei said, examining the only place she had ever known as 'home' and the state it had become. Shinji might have felt bad for her if it wasn't for the fact her 'home' was responsible for this, and she was a part of that plan._  
“这不对劲。”丽说道，审视着她唯一所知的‘家’以及它现在的状态。如果不是因为她的‘家’正是这一切的始作俑者，而她自己也参与其中，真嗣或许会为她感到难过。

Continuing to wander, Shinji's ear caught a soft tune of some kind. It was faint, but it was radiating from somewhere. Following and searching for some time, he came to an opening, facing towards the exposed GeoFront, the tunes were distinct here, reverberating off the metal walls from below his catwalk.  
继续游荡着，真嗣的耳朵捕捉到了一阵柔和的旋律。虽然微弱，但它确实来自某个地方。他跟随并寻找了一段时间，来到了一个开阔处，面对着暴露在外的大地裂缝，这里的旋律清晰可辨，从他脚下的天桥下方的金属墙壁上回荡开来。

The soothing melody got louder, and he descended, finally seeing exactly what was making the music.  
那抚慰人心的旋律越来越响亮，他走下台阶，终于看清了奏乐的源头。

Shinji frowned at the sight before him. A piano sat in the open, seemingly uncaring at the lack of protection from the elements, a small tree grew right next to it, casting a tiny amount of shade onto the seated figure.  
真嗣皱眉看着眼前的景象。一架钢琴露天摆放，似乎毫不在意风雨侵袭，旁边一棵小树茁壮成长，为坐着的身影投下些许阴凉。

Shinji knew him. 真嗣认识他。

He knew those red eyes well.  
他对那双红眼睛再熟悉不过了。

"_Who is that?" Rei tried to ask quietly to Soryu, who just shushed the girl._  
“那是谁？” 绫波试图小声问草薙，但对方只是示意她安静。

Shinji descended, along the creaking walkways until he finally reached the same level, slowly approaching the boy while studying his fingers as they seemed to glide across the keys, making strokes that produced joyous sounds.  
真嗣沿着吱嘎作响的通道缓缓下降，最终到达同一层，他慢慢走近那个男孩，观察着他的手指似乎在琴键上轻盈滑过，奏出欢快的音符。

Like a siren's call. 宛如塞壬的召唤。

And he, like an idiot, was moving towards the pale boy.  
而他，像个傻瓜一样，正朝着那个苍白的男孩走去。

Walking up, Shinji didn't wait to be invited, he promptly sat down on the bench next to him. The boy could feel the eyes on him now, calculating, judging, probably trying to decipher the bold movie.  
走近后，真嗣没有等待邀请，便直接坐在了男孩旁边的长椅上。男孩现在能感觉到那些目光在他身上，计算着，评判着，或许正试图解读这大胆的举动。

The music has stopped as he sat down, but Shinji took the liberty of starting it back up, allowing his fingers to glide across the keys just as the former's had.  
音乐在他坐下时已停止，但真嗣自作主张地重新启动了它，让手指如前者般滑过琴键。

Soon the joyous sounds of Sinatra were flowing from the piano, a bit off-key Shinji was sure, but it had been a bit since he played.  
不久，辛纳特拉欢快的旋律从钢琴中流淌出来，真嗣确信有些走调，但他已经有一段时间没弹了。

Of course, Shinji knew Sinatra was his favorite and soon Kaworu eagerly jumped in, the two of them working the keys in such a way that the masters of old would nod their heads in approval.  
当然，真嗣知道辛纳特拉是他的最爱，很快薰便热切地加入进来，两人以一种让昔日大师们点头赞许的方式共同弹奏着琴键。

Though it wasn't all synchronous. A small note off here, an invasive keystroke to the wrong side there. Each momentary musician was sizing the other up, the music quickening as neither backed down, both racing towards an ever-increasing crescendo.  
虽然并非完全同步。这里稍稍偏离了一点，那里又侵入了错误的按键。每位短暂的乐手都在打量对方，音乐随着双方都不退让而加速，共同奔向愈发高涨的渐强音。

It seemed to go on for hours, though he knew it could only have been a few minutes, but in that time the boy was sure any preexisting idea of Shinji Ikari had been shredded in Angel's mind.  
这似乎持续了数小时，尽管他知道实际上只有几分钟，但在那段时间里，男孩确信天使心中对碇真嗣的任何先入之见都已被撕得粉碎。

Finally, each player let loose a flurry of notes, allowing the peak of the music to be heard by the nonexistent audience as the last keystroke resounded off the walls.  
最终，每位演奏者都释放出一阵急促的音符，让音乐的巅峰之声在无形的观众面前响起，最后一个按键的回响在墙壁间回荡。

Finally, Shinji sat back from the keyboard and eyed his 'partner', whose thoughts he was sure he could read clear as day.  
终于，真嗣从键盘前靠后坐了坐，打量着他的‘搭档’，他确信自己能清晰地读懂对方的想法。

This was not the Third Child he expected.  
这不是他所期待的第三适格者。

"So, where'd you come from?"  
“那么，你是从哪儿来的？”

"I don't think one's origin is important," Kaworu said, deflecting.  
"我认为一个人的出身并不重要，"渚薰回避道。

Shinji rolled his eyes; he didn't have time for their usual dance.  
真嗣翻了个白眼；他没时间陪他们玩这种老把戏。

"No dumbass, I mean where did you die last…" Shinji said before cutting Kaworu's response.  
"不是傻瓜，我是说你上次死在哪里……"真嗣在渚薰回应前打断了他。

"Tabris." "塔布里斯。"

**Ah, how the tables have turned… but maybe even then it's not as it seems? And yes, there is now a cover lol, only took me forever to realize it didn't have to be perfect due to compression.  
啊，局势逆转了……但或许那时也并非表面那样？没错，现在有了封面哈哈，我花了好久才意识到由于压缩，它不必完美。**

**SHOUTOUTS! 特别鸣谢！**

**MooseTracks101- "Politics bore me!" Unless its post-apocalyptic politics….  
"MooseTracks101- “政治让我无聊透顶！”除非是后末日政治……”**

**SheriffJohnStone – Thanks! More of Asuka's story to come.  
SheriffJohnStone – 谢谢！更多关于明日香的故事即将到来。**

**NoseGum – Yeah I really am looking forwards to working on Misato and her basically neglect of Asuka and perhaps the rebuilding of that. That relationship with Shinji was really bringing her out of her ways, but she's just crushed after his 'betrayal' so it's a bit of a… relapse? Alright I'll see myself out.  
NoseGum – 是啊，我真的很期待深入挖掘美里和她在某种程度上忽视明日香的部分，以及可能的重建。她和真嗣的关系确实让她有所改变，但在他的‘背叛’之后，她简直崩溃了，所以有点像是……复发？好吧，我自己走开。**

**YodaMorpheus7- No, it was just a dream. Though maybe Shinji isn't the only one with a hitchhiker (possibly… I mean Rei's pretty much confirmed to be real)?  
YodaMorpheus7- 不，那只是一场梦。不过也许真嗣不是唯一一个有搭车客的人（可能吧……我是说绫波的存在几乎已经确认了）？**

**engel17white – Kawoshin ain't even a possibility, especially after the shit Kaworu pulled in NGE.  
engel17white – 碇真嗣和渚薰根本不可能，尤其是在《新世纪福音战士》中渚薰搞的那堆破事之后。**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – Shinji -centric chapter for ya!  
UltraSpink of Da USA – 以真嗣为中心的《1001 夜》献给你！**

**EvaPilotFair – Thanks! If you feel awful for Asuka then I'm doing what I set out to do.  
EvaPilotFair – 谢谢！如果你为明日香感到难过，那我就达到了我的目的。**

**mistalenny – 100%**

**dyinglittelstar (x2)- Thanks! A bit like Shinji waking up hmmm?  
dyinglittelstar (x2)- 多谢！有点像真嗣醒来的感觉呢，嗯？**

**Akomis – Thanks! I guess you can get away with kinda finegaling the story when Shinji had a few months to mess with things, but we do have a very good reason why there is still 2 continents alive, (Hint – It has to do with Kaji… and Shinji indirectly)  
阿科米斯——谢谢！我想当真嗣有几个月时间来捣乱时，你或许能巧妙地调整故事情节，但我们确实有一个很好的理由来解释为什么还有两块大陆幸存（提示——这和加持……以及真嗣间接有关）**

**Guest (1) – Thanks!  访客（1） – 谢谢！**

**Guest (2) – Kinda rough when you're the largest last nation around.  
访客（2） – 当你是周围最后一个大国时，情况确实有点棘手。**

**tomdj1701 – Yeah a 'catch me up' chat would be nice right about now.  
tomdj1701 – 是啊，现在来个‘让我跟上进度’的聊天会挺不错的。**

**Berix – Yo I feel that firs paragraph lol. Yeah NGE Gendo say's 'I didn't think shinji deserved to be loved by me' in a self-deprecating way, but what makes RoE Gendo that much worse for me is that Yui told him to take care of Shinji which I think is a great addition, that one little scene in 2.0. Server discord is just for the r/asushin subreddit, not rommel's.  
Berix – 哟，我觉得第一段挺有意思的，哈哈。没错，《新世纪福音战士》里的碇源堂说‘我不认为真嗣值得被我爱’，带着自我贬低的意味，但《新剧场版：序》里的碇源堂对我来说更糟糕的是，唯让他照顾真嗣，我觉得这个设定加得很好，就是 2.0 里的那一小幕。Discord 服务器只是为 r/asushin 子论坛服务的，不是 Rommel 的。  
As for worldbuilding, yeah I mean… just a little bit of effort is better than literally zero lol, so the bar isn't high I guess. The whole WILLE situation is a bit more complex but that's for later.  
至于世界观构建，嗯，我的意思是……哪怕一点点努力也比完全没有好，哈哈，所以门槛并不高。整个 WILLE 的情况稍微复杂一些，但那是后话了。**

**Yo typo list are back? POG!  
我回来了，名单打好了吗？太棒了！**

**calborghete – Thanks! calborghete – 谢谢！**

**engel17white (2) – Yui? Hmm, useful idiot? Maybe naive is the best term I have for her, at best at least.  
engel17white (2) – 由依？嗯，有用的傻瓜？或许“天真”是我对她最恰当的形容词，至少在最好的情况下是如此。**

**skyf0x – Thanks! With Asuka initially she's be like that after waking up, she'll have these threads to Shinji, and try to cut them, or at least try to do something to move on, but it never really works. It doesn't help Misato isn't being the figure she needs right then. And talking about Shinji? Oh boy that'll be the day. Idk how much time 3.0 is over, it can't be more than a week I bet, considering the piano was like sync training for Kaworu and Shinji mirroring NGE, I'd say less than a week. It's all a bit vague after 2.0 lol.  
skyf0x – 谢谢！起初，明日香醒来后会是那种状态，她会试图切断与真嗣的这些联系，或者至少尝试做些什么来继续前进，但这一切从未真正奏效。那时美里并不是她需要的那个角色，这无济于事。至于谈论真嗣？哦，那可真是遥遥无期。我不知道 3.0 的时间跨度有多长，我打赌不会超过一周，考虑到钢琴像是卡萝与真嗣的同步训练，以及与《新世纪福音战士》的镜像关系，我猜时间更短。2.0 之后的剧情都有些模糊不清，哈哈。**

**IllusoryMist – All caught up! Nice! Hope you enjoy future chapters!  
幻雾迷踪 – 全部追上了！太好了！期待你享受未来的章节！**

**Alright, I promise I'll have another chapter out if not next week the week after. This is one last one before finals.  
好吧，我保证如果下周不行，下下周一定会有新的chapter发布。这是期末考试前的最后一篇了。**


### Chapter 49: "…With just despair for company …"  
Chapter 49: "…唯有绝望相伴…"

_Asuka just sat there and purged the last of the LCL from her hair, while she stared at the translucent figure. If anything, it was a nice distraction from the sharp pains of injections sporadically occurring across her back.  
明日香只是坐在那里，将最后一丝 LCL 从头发中清除，同时凝视着那个半透明的身影。无论如何，这总比背后不时袭来的注射痛楚要好得多。_

"_Alright, last one," Ritsuko said as she flinched from another stab of pain in her back. Seconds later, the metallic clang of the injection gun being placed down signaled the end of her 'treatment'._  
“好了，最后一个。”律子说道，同时因为背部的又一次刺痛而微微退缩。几秒钟后，注射枪被放下的金属声响标志着她‘治疗’的结束。

"_You know, I'm amazed at the progress so far."_  
“你知道吗，我对目前的进展感到惊讶。”

_Asuka just kept her eyes on the small silhouette in front of her, unmoving, unchanging, it had simply stood there each time she had come to Akagi for her treatment. Usually, it stuck to when she was in LCL, now it was always there, silently watching.  
明日香只是盯着她面前那个小小的身影，一动不动，始终如一，每次她来赤木接受治疗时，它都静静地站在那里。通常它只在她浸泡在 LCL 中时出现，现在却一直都在，默默地注视着。_

"_You're well above the projected recovery estimates. It's only been two weeks but I would have thought you'd been at this for one or two months." The woman said as she grabbed a clipboard and scribbled something down before looking up to the girl. "Is there anything out of the ordinary you want to talk about?"_  
"你恢复得远超预期。才两周时间，但我还以为你已经这样一两个月了。" 女人说着拿起夹板，匆匆记下些什么，然后抬头看向女孩。"有什么异常的事情想聊聊吗？"

"_To you?" Asuka snarled, "no."_  
"对你？" 明日香咆哮道，"没有。"

_Ritsuko shrugged but was unsurprised at the rebuke. Asuka had made it no secret her disdain for the woman, and if, no, when, she got to talk to Misato, she'd ask for a replacement. Whether that would change the amount of pain the girl felt when she got supplemental injections, was up for debate.  
律子耸了耸肩，对这番斥责并不意外。明日香对她的厌恶从不掩饰，如果，不，是当她有机会和美里谈话时，她会要求换人。至于这能否减轻女孩在接受补充注射时的痛苦，则有待商榷。_

_Asuka grabbed her crutches and pushed herself up, wobbling slightly to find her balance. It was humiliating, but it was better than being pushed around in a wheelchair, always having someone hovering over you, and never getting a second of peace.  
明日香抓起拐杖，用力撑起身，微微摇晃着寻找平衡。这虽然丢脸，但总比坐在轮椅上被人推来推去，时刻有人守在身边，连片刻安宁都得不到要好。_

_She could almost hear Shinji's voice, telling her to take it easy, that her body would need time to heal, and all too often the ghost of his words was something she relied on too much.  
她几乎能听到真嗣的声音，告诉她要慢慢来，她的身体需要时间恢复，而他那些话的幽灵，她常常过于依赖。_

"_Remember don't push it, or I'll be forced to take those away." Ritsuko reminded her as she found her balance._  
“记得别逞强，不然我可要没收了。”律子提醒她找到平衡时说道。

_The girl mumbled an insult under her breath as she made her way out of the room, both the woman and small silhouette leaving her sight.  
女孩低声咕哝了一句脏话，随即走出房间，那女人和矮小的身影也随之消失在她的视线中。_

_These sessions had gotten better, that was an undeniable fact, the first time she had been put in the LCL vat, had been a pleasant relief to her body. In the vat her lungs were no longer strained, her limbs weren't supporting the full weight of her body, and she had a small sense of how she should have felt. Thought, there was something off.  
这些训练已经有所改善，这是不可否认的事实。第一次被放入 LCL 槽时，她的身体感到了一种愉悦的解脱。在槽中，她的肺不再受压，四肢也不再承受全身的重量，她有了一丝本应感受到的感觉。不过，总有些不对劲。_

_She couldn't remember a time when the feeling and smell of LCL had been discomforting. No, it had always been her home, the seat of an entry plug had always been the spot where she felt right in the world. At least until she met Shinji.  
她记不起何时 LCL 的感觉和气味变得令人不适。不，那一直是她的家，插入栓的座位始终是她感觉世界正确的地方。至少在遇见真嗣之前是这样。_

_The tank she had been spending time in recovering wasn't the same, but… it wasn't that different, and her reaction hadn't gone unnoticed by Ritsuko.  
她一直在其中恢复的坦克并非同一台，但……也并非截然不同，而她的反应并未逃过律子的眼睛。_

_The first time she had been submerged is when she saw it for the first time. The silhouette that she couldn't quite place but recalled from a blurry memory. A haze that came over her mind when Asuka tried to recall exactly where she had seen it before.  
第一次被浸入时，她首次见到了那个身影。那轮廓她无法确切辨认，却从模糊的记忆中有所印象。每当明日香试图回忆起曾在何处见过它时，脑海中便笼罩上一层迷雾。_

_Ritsuko had noticed, whether it was her reaction to something unseen or the spike in biometrics, it had been embarrassing to continually reaffirm the doctor that she was, in fact, fine in the same environment she had trained for years in. All that combined to just sour each meeting they had, though the fruit of her labors was undeniable, she was walking again or at least hobbling.  
律子注意到了，无论是她对某种无形之物的反应，还是生物指标的激增，都让她不断向医生确认自己确实适应了这个训练多年的环境，这实在令人尴尬。这一切加起来，使得每次会面都变得不愉快，尽管她的努力成果不容置疑，她又能行走了，或者说至少能一瘸一拐地走动了。_

_So, she hobbled through the small halls of her residency, making her way gingerly over the lower lips of bulkheads. Today she hadn't been all too annoyed to visit her doctor because she knew exactly what she was going to do right after.  
于是，她一瘸一拐地穿过住所狭小的走廊，小心翼翼地跨过舱壁的低缘。今天她并不太介意去看医生，因为她确切地知道自己接下来要做什么。_

_Asuka had gotten the information from some loose-lipped officer in the mess hall, the type that you wondered how they had been promoted in the first place. The commander would be free roughly around this time, and if the girl was lucky, she'd be able to find her.  
碇真嗣是从食堂里某个多嘴的军官那里得到的消息，那种人你真会好奇他们是怎么升职的。指挥官大约在这个时间有空，如果女孩运气好的话，她能找到她。_

_Thirty minutes later, however, Asuka was beginning to doubt it.  
然而，三十分钟过去了，碇真嗣开始怀疑这一点。_

_She had scoured the levels, listening around corners to officers speaking, peering into each and every room she could. Asuka even found the captain's quarters but was left disappointed by its vacancy.  
她已经搜遍了各个楼层，侧耳倾听着每个角落军官们的谈话，窥视着她能进入的每一个房间。甚至找到了舰长的寝室，却因空无一人而感到失望。_

_What would Shinji do? 真嗣会怎么做呢？_

_Shinji wouldn't have let this go to waste. No, Shinji would think of a way to find Misato, or maybe he'd just know where she was, much to her annoyance. The boy had always held some kind of answer.  
真嗣绝不会让这事白白浪费。不，真嗣会想办法找到美里，或者他可能就是知道她在哪儿，让她不胜其烦。这男孩总是掌握着某种答案。_

_Finally, she decided on one last place to look, one last flight of stairs before she gave up her search.  
最终，她决定再找最后一个地方，再爬最后一层楼梯，然后就放弃搜寻。_

_In all, the bridge wasn't as grandiose as she expected.  
总的来说，这座桥并没有她想象中的那么宏伟。_

_For what few crew members were there, each of them had their heads down working on their stations, no one cared to notice the redhead in loose-fitting civilian clothing, hobbling with crutches onto the bridge, unannounced, uninvited, and unauthorized.  
为数不多的船员们各自埋头于岗位工作，无人留意那位拄着拐杖、穿着宽松便装的红发女子，未经通告、未经邀请、未经授权地蹒跚步入舰桥。_

_Asuka didn't think of any of these things at that moment, she was too busy drinking in the wonderous view provided to her through the panorama of glass. The bright sky contrasted harshly against the red waters in which they sailed, and around them, an armada of ships cut through the waves, leaving white trails of foam behind them.  
那一刻，明日香并未考虑这些，她正忙于沉浸在玻璃全景带来的奇妙景色中。明亮的天空与他们航行的红色水域形成鲜明对比，四周舰队破浪前行，留下白色泡沫的尾迹。_

_It was a far cry from the dull colors she had been forced to endure while in the belly of the ship.  
这与她在船腹中被迫忍受的单调色彩相去甚远。_

_Battleships, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, tankers, supply ships, and other carriers all powered along through calm waters. If she didn't understand the power of an Evangelion, she would have thought she was in the middle of an unstoppable force.  
战列舰、巡洋舰、驱逐舰、护卫舰、油轮、补给船以及其他各种航母都在平静的水面上疾驰。如果她不了解 EVA 的力量，她可能会以为自己正身处一股不可阻挡的力量之中。_

_However, their own ship and many other carriers didn't appear ready for any form of combat, the flight deck was cluttered with all sorts of clutter. Makeshift shelters, tents, and pole buildings grew off it to make the entire flat top look more like a ship overgrown with vegetation than anything else.  
然而，他们自己的船和其他许多航母似乎都没有准备好进行任何形式的战斗，飞行甲板上堆满了各种杂物。临时避难所、帐篷和杆式建筑从甲板上延伸出来，使得整个平顶看起来更像是一艘被植被覆盖的船，而非其他。_

_Actually, was that a garden she was seeing?  
实际上，她看到的是一座花园吗？_

"_Did_ Cymbeline _sort out her reactor problems?"_  
“塞姆布琳是否解决了她的反应堆问题？”

_Asuka knew that voice. It was older but unmistakable, she had been on the receiving end of that firm tone once before when she had struck a nerve with the woman over Shinji's mother. Suddenly, she felt a sense of nostalgia for that moment, she wanted to find herself sitting at the kitchen table once more, eating that delicious breakfast instead of the slop served to them here.  
明日香认得那个声音。虽然更成熟了，但毫无疑问，她曾有一次因为提及真嗣的母亲而触动了那个女人的神经，那时她听到了这种坚定的语气。突然间，她对那一刻感到怀念，她希望自己能再次坐在厨房的餐桌旁，享用那顿美味的早餐，而不是这里提供的糟糕食物。_

_Misato. 美里。_

_The girl hobbled her way around console islands and to behind the commander, who was given reassurance by the communications officer she had posed the question to.  
女孩一瘸一拐地绕过控制台群，来到指挥官身后，指挥官从通讯官那里得到了她提问的答复，感到安心。_

"_Tell them they have 2 hours to fix it, we're running slow because of them." She ordered, before straightening up and turning, only to come face to face with Asuka._  
“告诉他们，他们有两小时来修复问题，我们因为他们的缘故运行缓慢。”她命令道，随后挺直身子转身，却迎面碰上了明日香。

_Each of them just stood there, one hunched over, supporting a broken body, and the other standing straight, appearing as an unshakable figure. A few wandering eyes looked between the two before their noses were pulled back to their own screens, unaware of the thoughts in either of their heads.  
他们各自站在那里，一个弯腰驼背，支撑着受伤的身体，另一个则笔直站立，显得坚不可摧。几双游离的眼睛在两人之间来回扫视，随后又回到各自的屏幕前，对两人内心的想法一无所知。_

_Asuka found herself looking up at the woman with a sense of hope. She wanted nothing more than for the woman to give her a reassuring pep talk, to show an ounce of that cheerful optimism the girl had found so annoying once. Even if she were to crack one joke, that would be alright with her, or just the smallest reassuring smile. What she hadn't expected was what came next.  
明日香发现自己带着一丝希望抬头看向那位女性。她最渴望的，就是这位女性能给她一些鼓励的话语，展现出哪怕一点点曾经让她觉得烦人的乐观态度。哪怕只是开个玩笑，她也会欣然接受，或者一个最微小的安慰微笑。但她未曾预料到接下来发生的事情。_

"_Who gave you permission to enter the bridge Pilot Shikinami?"_  
“是谁允许你进入舰桥的，式波·明日香？”

_A confused 'what' was all that escaped Asuka's lips. Permission? To talk to her?  
“什么”是明日香唯一脱口而出的词。许可？跟她说话？_

"_Exactly what are you doing here?"_  
“你到底在这里做什么？”

"_Um…" Asuka fumbled her words as she was bombarded with a glare she had never seen from the woman, "I wanted to talk?"._  
“呃……”明日香在女人从未有过的凌厉目光下结巴了，“我想谈谈？”

_The commander did not break off her glare, instead, she just let the words hover for a moment. Asuka couldn't see what was wrong with that explanation, she hadn't been able to speak with the woman for two whole weeks, what exactly was the problem?  
指挥官并未收回她的瞪视，反而让这些话悬停了一会儿。明日香看不出这个解释有何不妥，她已经整整两周没能与这位女士交谈了，究竟问题出在哪里？_

"_This is not the time."_  
“现在不是时候。”

_The words came across in such a blunt manner that Asuka didn't have any quick retort. Where was that warm smile she had hated? Where was the cheerful demeanor of her guardian? Where was the woman who forced her into a 'harmonizing' situation with Shinji?  
这番话如此直截了当，以至于明日香一时找不到迅速的反驳。那个她曾讨厌的温暖微笑去哪儿了？那位守护者的欢快举止又在哪里？那个强迫她与真嗣进行‘和谐’情境的女人呢？_

_Shinji. Would she speak to her like this if it was Shinji asking to talk? Would she ignore Shinji for two whole weeks if he had gone through what she was going through? Would Shinji be forced to wake up in the middle of the night from nightmares and not have anyone to go to?  
真嗣。如果是真嗣提出想谈谈，她会这样对他讲话吗？如果他经历了她所经历的一切，她会整整两周不理真嗣吗？真嗣会因为噩梦半夜惊醒，却无处可去吗？_

_No. 不。_

_But she wasn't Shinji. 但她不是真嗣。_

"_Wha... What are you talking about!?" Asuka shouted, earning another glance from those around her. "I've been awake for two weeks and you haven't even come to see me!"_  
“什...你说什么！？”明日香喊道，引得周围人又投来目光。“我已经醒了两周，你甚至都没来看过我！”

_Misato frowned at the outburst, before turning to a door leading to a catwalk just outside, "Pilot, I think we should step outside for a moment."  
美里对这番爆发皱了皱眉，随后转向通往外面天桥的门，“驾驶员，我想我们应该出去一会儿。”_

_Asuka could feel the bridge crew's eyes behind her as she followed, but couldn't have known about the small packages being quietly exchanged between crewmembers, each placing bets on the severity of the reprimand that they believed was about to occur.  
明日香能感觉到身后舰桥人员投来的目光，她紧随其后，却未曾察觉到船员间悄然传递的小包裹，每个人都在为即将到来的训斥程度下注，猜测其严厉程度。_

_Outside the wind rang in her ears but shielded by the tower Asuka was more than capable of having a conversation with the older woman. Though it appeared it would be anything but the conversation she had wanted.  
塔外风声呼啸，但有塔身庇护，明日香与那位年长女性交谈起来毫无障碍。然而，这场对话显然不会是她所期待的那般。_

"_First," Misato raised a finger "I'll allow that prior outburst due to the stressful situation you must've been going through."_  
"首先，" 美里竖起一根手指，"我允许你之前的爆发，考虑到你当时必定经历的压力情境。"

"_I…" Asuka started but was cut off._  
"我…" 明日香刚开口就被打断了。"

"_Second," the woman raised a second finger, "you will address me as Captain and a superior officer."_  
"其次，" 这位女士竖起第二根手指，"你必须称呼我为上尉和上级军官。"

"_But…"_ "但是…"

"_Third," A final finger was raised, "as your superior, I don't have time to talk with you Asuka, this isn't four years ago. Unit-02 will be operational when resources allow it, until then your job is to prepare to pilot again, that's what you want correct?"_  
"第三，" 最后一根手指也举了起来，"作为你的上级，我没有时间和你闲聊，这不是四年前。二号机将在资源允许时投入使用，在此之前，你的任务是准备再次驾驶，这正是你想要的，对吧？"

_Asuka nodded slowly, unsure of whether she even had a choice in the first place. There was no Tokyo-03, no base to protect, no purpose for her life's dedication outside of fighting.  
明日香缓缓点头，不确定自己是否一开始就有选择的余地。没有东京-03，没有基地需要守护，除了战斗，她一生奉献的目标已不复存在。_

_The Eva was all she had.  
Eva 是她仅有的全部。_

_What exactly was she supposed to do now? There was nothing else.  
她现在究竟该做什么？已经别无他法了。_

_The woman swiftly turned to and began to enter the bridge but was stopped just as she gripped the door's latch.  
女人迅速转身，正要进入舰桥，却在握住门把手的那一刻被拦住了。_

"_If you want to know about Shinji," Asuka spoke up, her voice cold, "ask yourself, don't have your lapdog do it."_  
“如果你想了解真嗣，”明日香开口道，声音冰冷，“先问问你自己，别让你的走狗代劳。”

_Misato said nothing and went inside, closing the hatch behind her and leaving the girl standing there alone on the catwalk.  
美里一言不发地走进去，关上了身后的舱门，留下女孩独自站在天桥上。_

ʡʘʘʘʢ

Misato just stood there and stared at it.  
美里只是站在那里，凝视着它。

It just sat there, a relic from a bygone era, something that didn't belong here, that had outlived its usefulness. A part of her wanted to touch it, to feel the rubbery lining, to have a chill run through her hand at the metal components, if for nothing else then to confirm that all this was real, everything that had transpired over the last few days wasn't some dream.  
它就那样静静地待着，一个来自过去时代的遗物，本不该出现在这里，早已失去了它的用处。她的一部分想要触摸它，感受那橡胶般的内衬，让金属部件带来的寒意穿过手掌，即便只是为了确认这一切都是真实的，过去几天发生的一切并非梦境。

Another part of her, a part that had protected her for years, dared not even reach out to it.  
她内心深处，那个多年来一直守护着她的部分，甚至不敢伸手去触碰它。

In her captain quarters, the commander had been petrified for 10 minutes just looking at the plug suit folded neatly on her bed.  
在她的舰长室里，指挥官已经石化了 10 分钟，只是盯着床上叠得整整齐齐的插头服。

A knock on the door forced Misato to move and allowed Ritsuko into the room, while the commander checked over documents on her desk.  
敲门声迫使美里动了起来，让律子进入了房间，而指挥官则在桌前检查文件。

"The damaged was enough that we'll have to have a meeting, I informed the officers that it'll be in the next 30 minutes," Ritsuko said, not looking up from her datapad.  
“损失严重到我们必须召开会议，”律子说道，目光未曾离开数据板，“我已通知各位官员，会议将在接下来的三十分钟内举行。”

"Fine." Misato leaned back in her chair, rubbing her eyes. She truly had wanted to get some rest, but that could come after.  
“好吧。”美里向后靠在椅子上，揉了揉眼睛。她确实想休息一下，但那可以稍后再说。

The doctor looked up, only to have her eye caught by the blue mass at the edge of the bed. "Haven't touched it?"  
医生抬起头，目光却被床边那一抹蓝色吸引。“没碰过它吗？”

Misato said nothing, she knew exactly what the woman was referring to without even opening her eyes.  
美里一言不发，她闭着眼睛也清楚医生指的是什么。

"He can still be used as a trigger, we'll have to go after him eventually."  
"他仍可作为触发器，我们最终还是得去找他。"

"Yeah," Misato agreed, the exhaustion in her voice evident, but none the less she stood up and moved towards the door, "We have supplies to recover first, then we'll go."  
"是啊，" 美里同意道，声音中的疲惫显而易见，但她还是站起身，走向门口，"我们先去回收物资，然后再行动。"

"You really think she's going to want to hear that?" Ritsuko asked, frowning, but following.  
"你真觉得她会想听这些吗？" 律子皱眉问道，但还是跟了上去。"

"No, but it's not her decision."  
"不，但这不是她的决定。"

ʡʘʘʘʢ

"Alright, I want critical repairs done in 24 hours and auxiliary repairs done in 36. Dismissed"  
"好，我希望 24 小时内完成关键修复，辅助修复在 36 小时内完成。解散。"

Misato took a deep breath as the rumble of dozens of chairs being emptied filled the room. A few nods and salutes were all she received as the officers funneled out of the room, leaving only the captain herself remaining.  
当数十把椅子被腾空的轰鸣声充斥房间时，美里深吸了一口气。她只收到了几个点头和敬礼，军官们鱼贯而出，只留下她自己作为舰长留在室内。

Taking a seat, she placed her hat down on the table and slouched in the chair. It was rare to have such meetings these days. She was used to simply being obeyed, for others to figure out the details without her, her rank and the admiration of those under her gave her such a privilege.  
她坐了下来，将帽子搁在桌上，慵懒地靠在椅背上。如今这样的会面已不多见。她习惯了被服从，习惯了别人替她处理细节，她的地位与下属的敬仰赋予了她这份特权。

However, there were days where she found herself remembering the hushed tones of NERV personnel surrounding a dimly lit table, throwing out ideas to combat a new Angel and completely naive to the true purpose of NERV. Days when she could commandeer prototype positron rifle or ask children to 'catch' a falling Angel. Days when she could almost remember relishing the plans she would concoct and the details surrounding them or lack thereof.  
然而，有些日子里，她会回想起 NERV 人员围坐在昏暗灯光下的低语，他们提出各种对抗新使徒的构想，却对 NERV 的真正目的浑然不觉。那些日子里，她能征用原型阳电子步枪，或是让孩子们去“捕捉”坠落的使徒。那些日子里，她几乎能忆起自己曾陶醉于精心策划的计划及其细节，或缺乏细节的种种。

Some days, she would give almost anything to be back in Tokyo-3 again.  
有些日子，她几乎愿意付出一切，只为能再次回到第三新东京市。

The hiss of the door opening again brought her back to reality, and the mop of red hair signaled to her that she was not going to enjoy this conversation.  
门的再次嘶嘶声将她拉回现实，那一头红发预示着她不会喜欢接下来的对话。

"What's the plan?" Asuka practically barked.  
“计划是什么？”明日香几乎是咆哮着问道。

"Plan?" Misato responded lazily.  
"计划？" 美里懒洋洋地回应道。

"Shinji." She said, as if it were so obvious, "How are we going to get him back?"  
"真嗣。" 她仿佛这是再明显不过的事，"我们怎么把他带回来？"

"First of all, we don't even know where he is…"  
"首先，我们甚至不知道他在哪里……"

"Don't be stupid," Asuka cut her off, "we know exactly where he is."  
"别犯傻了，" 明日香打断她，"我们确切知道他在哪儿。"

Misato sighed, why was it that she had to be so difficult.  
美里叹了口气，为什么她总是这么难搞。

"We could use the contingency plan; we'd be able to sneak in before their defenses could detect us."  
"我们可以动用应急计划；这样我们就能在他们防御系统察觉之前悄悄潜入。"

"Most of those defenses are left over from Tokyo-3's, they couldn't hurt us now even if they tried," Misato mused, "but that's not the issue."  
"这些防御系统大多是继承自第三新东京市的，就算它们想攻击我们，现在也伤不了我们分毫，" 美里沉思道，"但这不是问题的关键。"

"Then what is?" Asuka growled.  
"那问题是什么？" 明日香咆哮道。"

"_Wunder_ needs repairs, that'll take long enough, and we have a supply drop near Bikini Atoll we're in transit to now."  
"Wunder 号需要维修，这会耗费不少时间，而且我们现在正前往比基尼环礁附近的一个补给点。"

"So, we're not going to do anything? We're just going to leave him to his father? You heard what he said, he was confused, he…"  
"所以，我们什么都不做吗？就让他留在他父亲那里？你听到了，他当时很困惑，他……"

"Knew about his father's plans from the beginning." Misato finished her sentence, "He confirmed that much, what does that tell you?"  
"从一开始就知道他父亲的计划。" 美里完成了她的句子，"他确认了这一点，这说明了什么？"

Asuka gritted her teeth "Even if he was working for his father, it doesn't matter, they could still use him to start another impact, you know that!"  
明日香咬紧牙关：“即使他是为他父亲工作，那也无所谓，他们仍可能利用他引发另一次冲击，你明白的！”

"I do, but I also know you. Don't pretend this is about that Asuka, you're too close to this. I thought you gave up being this blind."  
"我确实知道，但我也了解你。别假装这是为了那个明日香，你对此太过投入。我以为你已经放弃了这种盲目。"

"Don't…" "不要…"

"What _pilot_? Remind you exactly why that brace is on your leg?" Misato said, raising her hand to catch the slap from the girl, "I gave you the first one, but this is exactly why I didn't tell you when we found him. Despite all these years, you're still attached to him."  
"哪个驾驶员？提醒你一下，你腿上的支架是为了什么？" 美里说着，抬起手挡住了女孩的耳光，"我给了你第一次机会，但这就是为什么我们找到他时我没有告诉你。尽管这么多年过去了，你还是对他念念不忘。"

"I don't know what I feel." Asuka admitted, "But at least I still feel something."  
"我不知道我有什么感觉。" 明日香承认道，"但至少我还有感觉。"

Misato said nothing, she just let go of the girl's wrist and watched as Asuka walked away.  
美里什么也没说，只是松开了女孩的手腕，看着明日香走开。

**You know, I think Asuka just wanted someone to give her a hug and tell her everything is going to be alright. I don't think that's too much to ask. It should have been Misato, but damn that hedgehog strikes again, opening up to Shinji only to have that massively backfire? Oof. This is the feeling I got between the two in 3.0, this abrasive, almost-ruined relationship, and I thought it would be fun to build on it.  
你知道吗，我觉得明日香只是想要有人给她一个拥抱，告诉她一切都会好起来的。我不认为这要求过分。本该是美里来做这件事，但该死的刺猬再次作祟，向真嗣敞开心扉却导致情况严重恶化？哎。这就是我在《Q》中感受到的两人之间那种刺痛、近乎破裂的关系，我觉得以此为基础展开故事会很有趣。**

**SHOUTOUTS! 特别鸣谢！**

**skyf0x – Thanks! I think there are just things that could have been essentially been fixed with minimal effort. Two dude hanging out alone for 14 years being one of them haha. I'm sure Fuyutsuki would have been tampering at the very least to keep himself busy. I think Gendo has always been willfully blind, it's his nature, Yui above all else, just like a how a certain boy feels about a Asuka hmmm? Kaworu will be fun, next chapter and beyond!  
skyf0x – 谢谢！我觉得有些事情本可以用最小的努力来解决。两个男人独自相处了 14 年就是其中之一，哈哈。我相信至少冬月会找些事情做来打发时间。我认为源堂一直是有意视而不见，这是他的本性，他心中只有唯，就像某个男孩对明日香的感情一样，嗯？与渚薰的互动将会很有趣，接下来是chapter及以后的故事！**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – I think Rebuild Gendo is blinded so much more in her quest for Yui, even to forget she asked him specifically to take care of Shinji. I do think that one little detail really changes how we feel about Gendo and even that he almost tried in 2.0 at some sort of a connection, however fleeting that effort was.  
UltraSpink of Da USA – 我认为《新剧场版》中的源堂在追求唯的过程中更加盲目，甚至忘记了唯曾特别要求他照顾真嗣。我确实认为这一小细节真正改变了我们对源堂的看法，甚至他在《序》中几乎尝试建立某种联系，尽管那努力转瞬即逝。**

**tomdj1701 – Yeah… they SHOULD be looking for him.  
tomdj1701 – 是啊…他们本该去找他的。**

**Mango eater 24 – Wow, binged the whole thing? That's quite a feat.  
芒果吃货 24 – 哇，一口气看完了？真是个壮举。**

**Sorry for the long wait, the holiday season just kinda had me putting this off. The next few chapters should come in quick succession (hopefully), and it will be all Shinji for a few. Happy New Year guys!  
抱歉让大家久等了，假期季节让我一直拖延。接下来几章应该会很快陆续发布（希望如此），接下来会有几章全是关于真嗣的。新年快乐，各位！**

**Until Next Time 下次再见**


### Chapter 50: "..Are we both from a different world?…"  
Chapter 50: "…我们来自不同的世界吗？…"

_As Shinji looked out over the building sprouting from the still waters, he couldn't help but feel how weak he was.  
当真嗣眺望着从静水中拔地而起的高楼时，他不禁感到自己的软弱。_

_Too weak to save Toji.  
无力拯救冬二。_

_Too weak to keep Asuka from being hurt.  
无力阻止明日香受伤。_

_Too weak to save Rei.  
无力拯救丽。_

_It had been his fault before, but now? He was more at fault than ever.  
过去这曾是他的错，但现在呢？他比以往任何时候都更加有错。_

_But he wouldn't give up, not like last time. He would endure, this was the farthest he had come, and all he needed to do was keep it from all coming crashing down. He was strong enough to do this now.  
但他不会放弃，不像上次那样。他会坚持下去，这是他迄今为止走得最远的一次，他只需要防止这一切轰然崩塌。他现在足够坚强，能够做到这一点。_

_Asuka was nowhere near the state she had been at this point, the fact she wasn't currently sedated in the medical wing was testament enough to that. When that's your lowest point, it doesn't take much to be a massive improvement, but right now he had something else to deal with.  
明日香远未达到她此时的状态，她没有被安置在医疗翼中接受镇静治疗，这一事实足以证明。当你处于最低谷时，不需要太多就能有巨大的改善，但眼下他有其他事情要处理。_

_The sun lowered itself on the horizon and Shinji finally heard what he had come to the shore for.  
太阳缓缓沉入地平线，真嗣终于听到了他来到岸边所追寻的声音。_

_Following the tune, he finally found the boy. He was sitting atop a ruined statue just as he had the first time. The tunes of Od to Joy reached out from him, a song Shinji had come to hate.  
随着旋律，他终于找到了那个男孩。他正坐在一座残破的雕像上，就像第一次见面时那样。《欢乐颂》的旋律从他那里传出，这首歌真嗣已渐渐憎恶起来。_

"_That song is good, singing brings joy and revitalizes the human soul. I think that song is one of the highest achievements of the Lilin culture. Don't you agree Shinji Ikari?"_  
“那首歌很好，歌唱带来欢乐并振奋人心。我认为那是人类文化中最高的成就之一。你不这么认为吗，碇真嗣？”

_Shinji's hands balled into fists. His teeth were grinding against each other and it was taking every ounce of self-control to keep himself from rushing towards the child of Adam.  
真嗣的双手紧握成拳。他的牙齿相互摩擦，竭尽全力控制自己不冲向亚当之子。_

"_I hate that song."_ “我讨厌那首歌。”

"_Really?" he asked, hopping down from the ruined statue "That's interesting."_  
“真的吗？”他从毁坏的雕像上跳下，“这倒挺有意思。”

_He jumped to the shore and casually walked up the boy, hands in his pockets, without so much as a worry in the world. Closing in on him, Kaworu leaned in to examine the boy, a bit too much like when he first met Asuka, but eventually, he leaned back.  
他跳上岸，悠闲地走向那个男孩，双手插在口袋里，仿佛世间无忧无虑。走近后，渚薰俯身仔细打量着男孩，那神情与他初次见到明日香时有些相似，但最终他还是直起了身。_

"_You should be happy, you're the famous Third Children, you'll go on to…"_  
“你应该感到高兴，你是著名的第三适格者，你将会继续……”

_His words were cut off by Shinji's fist, the boy couldn't contain himself, not with those curled lips and slick voice. The impact was nothing new, a sharp pain flared through his knuckles but he didn't relent. Again Shinji let his fist fly, again and again, he felt the impact against the face of the boy. How dare he look at him like that after what he did.  
他的话被真嗣的拳头打断了，男孩无法忍受那翘起的嘴唇和油滑的声音。这一击并不新鲜，剧烈的疼痛从他的指关节传来，但他没有退缩。真嗣再次挥拳，一次又一次，他感受到拳头击打在那个男孩脸上的冲击。他怎么敢在他做了那些事之后还那样看着他。_

_As the cicadas chirped and the small ripples splashed against the shoreline, the sound of the boy driving the other to the ground rang out across the water, which remained unaffected by either of their actions.  
蝉鸣阵阵，小浪轻拍岸边，男孩将对方摔倒在地的声响在水面上回荡，而水面却丝毫不为他们的动作所动。_

_All too soon, Kaworu's hair was matted with red stains, like blood in snow.  
转眼间，渚薰的头发便沾满了红色污迹，宛如雪地中的血迹。_

_ʡʘʘʘʢ_

_She just stood there, gazing up at Unit-02, examining every little detail, every line, every bend of its armor. Asuka didn't know why she needed to secure the image of the Evangelion in her mind, but here she was all the same. She had no concept of the passage of time until the sound of footsteps alerted her that she was not alone. Turning, she saw the pale face of the Fifth Children approach her, the slightest curve of his lip unnerving her.  
她就那样站在那里，仰望着二号机，仔细打量着它的每一个细节，每一道线条，每一处装甲的弯曲。明日香不明白为何要将这架福音战士的形象牢牢印在脑海中，但她确实就这样做了。她对时间的流逝毫无概念，直到脚步声提醒她并非独自一人。转身望去，她看到了第五适格者苍白的脸庞向她走来，他嘴角微妙的弧度让她感到不安。_

_Asuka had instantly disliked the boy, not because of anything he had done, he was strange, but so was Rei. No, it was because Shinji didn't like him, he had told her it was best that she avoided him, while hiding any history she sensed was shared between the two boys.  
明日香立刻对那个男孩产生了反感，并非因为他做了什么，他很奇怪，但丽也一样。不，是因为真嗣不喜欢他，他告诉她最好避开他，同时隐瞒了她察觉到的两人之间共享的过往。_

"_Magnificent, isn't it?" he asked, planting himself next to her and staring up at those four green 'eyes'._  
"真是壮观，不是吗？" 他问道，站到她身旁，抬头凝视着那四只绿色的"眼睛"。

"_Yeah, I guess it is." She affirmed, turning her gaze back to the figure._  
"是啊，我想是的。" 她肯定道，目光重新转向那身影。

"_Forgive me, but may I ask you something?" he said, breaking the uncomfortable silence that had fallen between them._  
"请原谅，但我能问你一个问题吗？" 他打破了两人间尴尬的沉默。

"_Fine." She growled out, what exactly did he want?_  
"好吧。" 她咆哮着，他到底想要什么？

"_How did you become a pilot?" he asked, his eyes landing on her like he was examining her. Was this some sort of test? If that was the case, two could play at this game._  
"你是怎么成为飞行员的？" 他问道，目光落在她身上，仿佛在审视她。这是某种考验吗？如果是的话，两个人都能玩这个游戏。

"_How did you?" she countered only to receive a more pronounced smile._  
"你呢？" 她反问，只换来一个更加明显的微笑。

"_I was born for it. This and other things, but it's simply my destiny." He responded, the words sounding completely sincere despite the ridiculousness of them._  
"我天生就是干这个的。还有其他事情，但这就是我的命运。" 他回答道，尽管这些话听起来很荒谬，但他的语气却完全真诚。

"_I guess you could say the same for me. The Eva's all I've known." She said._  
我想你也可以这么说我自己。Eva 就是我所知道的一切。她说。

"_Hmm," he pondered the answer for a moment like he couldn't fully grasp what she had said, "so it defines you?"_  
"嗯，" 他沉思片刻，仿佛无法完全理解她的话，"所以它定义了你？"

"_I guess." That was a lie. Asuka thought it had, she thought it had been the only thing to give her a purpose in life, the only thing that would make people see her. Now she knew that wasn't true, someone else could see her, he could see the real her._  
"我想是吧。" 这是个谎言。明日香曾以为是的，她曾以为那是赋予她生命意义的唯一事物，是唯一能让人们看到她的东西。现在她知道那不是真的，有人能看到她，他能看见真实的她。

"_Then why does he like you?"_  
"那他为什么喜欢你？"

"_What was that?" Asuka raised an eyebrow, taking her gaze away from Unit-02._  
"那是什么？" 明日香挑起眉毛，将视线从二号机上移开。

"_The Third Children, you and he seem to have a… connection of sorts." He said simply, "And you always will. Even now, it doesn't make sense."_  
"第三适格者，你和他似乎有一种……某种联系。" 他简单地说道，"而且这种联系将永远存在。即便现在，这也不合逻辑。"

"_What exactly does that mean?"_  
"那究竟是什么意思？"

"_I thought, no, I knew Shinji Ikari was destined to be alone… in all my time I've only ever seen him fail…" he answered, his face scrunching in confusion._  
"我以为，不，我知道碇真嗣注定要孤独一生……在我所见的时间里，他总是失败。" 他回答道，脸上露出困惑的表情。

"_Shinji… is a good friend." She said quickly, how could he know about the two of them? No one knew._  
"真嗣……是个好朋友。" 她迅速说道，他怎么会知道他们俩的事？没人知道。

"_You lie, he's much more than that." He countered "And it confuses me."_  
"你在撒谎，他远不止如此。" 他反驳道，"这让我感到困惑。"

"_Why?" she asked, as she desperately tried to figure out why they were talking about this._  
"为什么？" 她问道，拼命试图弄清楚他们为何谈论这个。

"_Because I was just like him… but he's changed… it's so odd."_  
"因为我曾经和他一样…但他变了…这太奇怪了。"

"_You said you know him before?"_  
"你说过你以前认识他？"

"_Yes."_ "是的。"

"_How?"_ “怎么？”

"_It's a long story."_ "说来话长。"

"_Really?"_ "真的吗？"

"_Yes," Kaworu said, now turning and letting his crimson eyes bore into her crystal ones, "I've watched him die."_  
"是的，" 渚薰说道，此刻转过身来，他那深红色的眼眸深深凝视着她水晶般的双眸，"我看着他死去。"

"_D-Die?"_ "死-死去了？"

"_Yes, and he's killed me more times than I can count, it really is a silly little game at this point." He mused, "But you? You're special to him."_  
"是的，他杀我的次数多到数不清，现在看来这真是个无聊的小游戏。" 他沉思道，"但你？你对他来说很特别。"

_Asuka just stared, no longer annoyed. She was now somehow terrified of this boy, without any threat of violence towards her Asuka could still feel her heart racing in her chest. Shinji had killed him? What did that mean? What did he mean by any of this? And what did he mean by her being special to Shinji?  
明日香只是凝视着，不再感到恼怒。她现在不知为何对这个男孩感到恐惧，尽管没有任何暴力威胁，明日香仍能感觉到自己的心跳在胸腔中加速。真嗣杀了他？这是什么意思？他说的这一切又是什么意思？而他所说的她对真嗣特别，又意味着什么？_

"_He'll throw the world away for you, and it's perplexing."_  
"他会为你抛弃整个世界，这真是令人费解。"

"_Why?" she breathed._ "为什么？" 她轻声问道。

"_Because there's nothing special about you."_  
"因为你没什么特别的。"

"_What the hell does that mean?!" she lashed out at him, her temper flaring._  
"这他妈什么意思？！" 她冲他发火，脾气一下子爆发了。

"_Everything tells me you two couldn't be more incompatible if you tried, is so strange," he said, bringing his hand up to his chin, rubbing it._  
"所有迹象都表明，你们俩要是想不般配，简直再容易不过了，真是奇怪，" 他说着，抬起手摸着下巴，摩挲着。

"_What the hell do you want?" Asuka finally asked._  
"你到底想要什么？" 绫波终于问道。

"_He would trade your life for anything, it is so bizarre, Lilin shouldn't be capable of such… understanding, the barrier around his heart is so strong, yet… he opens it for you…" Kaworu explained. "What makes you so special?"_  
"他愿意用你的生命去交换任何东西，这太奇怪了，人类不应该有这样的……理解，他心中的屏障如此坚固，然而……他却为你敞开了心扉……" 渚薰解释道。"是什么让你如此特别？"

_ʡʘʘʘʢ_

_Neo San Fransisco. 新旧金山。_

_He sat there, just admiring the reflection of the city lights on the bay. He'd never been to the United States and he figured he never really would get the chance, but it seemed every new chance he had was simply becoming more and more divergent from his original life.  
他坐在那里，只是欣赏着海湾上映出的城市灯光。他从未去过美国，也觉得可能永远没有机会了，但似乎每一次新的机遇都只是让他与原本的生活越来越背离。_

_None of them had truly changed, it was really just the setting, a culture he truly didn't understand, yet it welcomed him all the same. It was almost relaxing, there was a carefree atmosphere that he couldn't help but feel refreshed by, even if his purpose was the same as before.  
他们之中没有人真正改变，实际上只是环境变了，一个他完全不理解的文化，却同样接纳了他。这种感觉几乎让人放松，一种无忧无虑的氛围让他不禁感到神清气爽，即便他的目的依旧如初。_

"_Shinji Ikari." The voice was as smooth as always, but it didn't stir the same feelings in him. No, that fire had long since died out._  
“碇真嗣。”那声音一如既往地平滑，却不再激起他心中的波澜。不，那份激情早已熄灭。

_After all, how long could you hate one person? Especially if they knew what you really were.  
毕竟，你能恨一个人多久呢？尤其是当他们知道你真正的本质时。_

"Urgh, not him again," Soryu muttered, having already laid down on the grass a few paces away.  
"呃，又是他," 惣流低声抱怨着，已经在几步之外的草地上躺了下来。

_Shinji didn't even look over at the pale boy as he sat down next to him, the clanking of metal cans ringing out as he placed the pack of drinks between them.  
真嗣没有看向那个苍白的男孩，只是坐在他旁边，随着他将一包饮料放在两人之间，金属罐的碰撞声响了起来。_

"_Sinatra still your favorite?" Shinji asked, not taking his eyes off the bay._  
"辛纳特拉还是你的最爱吗？" 真嗣问道，目光始终没有离开海湾。

"_Of course," he replied, "1964 marks the greatest achievement of the Lilins."_  
"当然，" 他回答道，"1964 年标志着莉莉丝们最伟大的成就。"

_Shinji had nothing to say to the boy, he just reached over and removed a drink from the plastic yokes and twisted off the cap allowing the carbonated drink to hiss.  
真嗣对那男孩无话可说，他只是伸手从塑料架上取下一瓶饮料，拧开瓶盖，让碳酸饮料发出嘶嘶声。_

"_So, where was your last life Tabris?"_  
"那么，你上一世在哪儿，塔布里斯？"

"_Oh, still calling me that now?"_  
"哦，现在还这么叫我？"

"_What? You really want me to call you Kaworu?"_  
"什么？你真要我叫你薰吗？"

"_Yes. Since we know each other so well since we're friends."_  
"是的。既然我们彼此这么熟悉，已经是朋友了。"

"_We don't and we're not friends."_  
"我们不是朋友，也不是那种关系。"

"_Is this not a sign of friendship to Lilin?" he asked, taking a bottle, and doing the same as Shinji had._  
"这对莉莉丝来说难道不是友谊的象征吗？" 他问道，拿起一瓶酒，像真嗣那样做了。

"_You really think just sharing a drink is what makes a friend to us?" Shinji snorted, taking another sip._  
"你真的以为只是分享一杯酒就能成为我们的朋友吗？" 真嗣嗤之以鼻，又喝了一口。

_Kaworu said nothing and just pulled his legs up to his chest.  
渚薰没有说话，只是将双腿蜷缩到胸前。_

"_I apologize."_ “我很抱歉。”

_Shinji snapped his head to look at the other boy, who didn't turn to meet him.  
真嗣猛地转头望向另一个男孩，对方却没有回望他。_

"_It's my nature. Though, I realize now that you are more than capable of changing yourself."_  
"这是我的本性。不过，我现在意识到你完全有能力改变自己。"

_Shinji sighed, and took another sip, "I haven't changed, not really." he admitted.  
真嗣叹了口气，又喝了一口，"我并没有改变，真的没有。"他承认道。_

"_I beg to differ," Kaworu replied._  
"我不同意，"薰回答道。"

_A silence came over them as the gentle breeze ran between them. As the last of the drinks were finished, Shinji leaned back on the hill, allowing himself to gaze up at the stars above.  
一阵静默笼罩了他们，轻柔的微风在他们之间穿梭。当最后一杯饮料喝完时，真嗣靠在山坡上，让自己仰望头顶的星空。_

"_Do you like looking at the stars?" Kaworu asked._  
“你喜欢看星星吗？”渚薰问道。

_Shinji frowned at the question, "Yes… it reminds me of…" he stopped, not wanting to go on.  
真嗣对这个问题的皱起了眉头，“是的……它让我想起了……”他停了下来，不想继续说下去。_

"_Yes?"_ "什么事？"

"_It's not really your business."_  
"这真的不关你的事。"

"_I understand, you enjoy the absolute nature of it don't you? After all this time nothing in the night sky has changed." Kaworu said, resting his hands behind his head. Shinji could picture that annoying little smile on his face as he said it._  
"我明白，你喜欢它的绝对性，不是吗？毕竟这么长时间了，夜空中的景象从未改变。" 渚薰说着，将双手枕在脑后。真嗣能想象到他说这话时脸上那令人恼火的小微笑。

"_No." Shinji countered, "After the Ninth Angel, we all sat on a hill and just watched the night sky. It was… peaceful."_  
"不。" 真嗣反驳道，"在第九使徒之后，我们都坐在一座小山上，只是静静地看着夜空。那感觉……很宁静。"

"Man fears the darkness, and so, he scrapes away at the edges of it with fire." he heard Soryu mumble from her spot. Honestly, he couldn't tell if she said it in a mocking tone or with a sense of nostalgia.  
"人类畏惧黑暗，因此他用火焰在黑暗的边缘不断挖掘。" 他听到 Soryu 从她的位置上喃喃自语。老实说，他无法分辨她是以嘲讽的语气还是带着一丝怀旧之情说出这句话的。

"_Perhaps one day you'll find your peace again." Kaworu mused._  
"或许有一天，你会再次找到你的平静。" 渚薰若有所思地说。

_For a while longer they just stared into the sky, admiring the universe that was on display for them. Though, Shinji knew both of them would soon be called to fill their parts to play.  
他们又凝视了一会儿天空，欣赏着展现在他们面前的宇宙。尽管，真嗣知道他们两人很快就会被召唤去扮演各自的角色。_

"_So you want to do it now or whenever?" Shinji asked._  
"那么你想现在做还是随时做？" 真嗣问道。

"_So casual about killing me," Kaworu chuckled, "what's gotten into you?"_  
"对我下杀手这么随意啊，"渚薰轻笑，"你这是怎么了？"

"_I guess I just don't care anymore," Shinji answered._  
"我想我只是不再在乎了，"真嗣回答道。"

"_No, you'll never stop caring Shinji, not anymore."_  
"不，你永远不会停止在乎的，真嗣，再也不会了。"

"_If only you knew."_ "要是你早知道就好了。"

ʡʘʘʘʢ

"Tabris." "塔布里斯。"

Kaworu fell off the piano bench and onto the ground as the word left his lips. Shinji just gave him an unimpressed look for the display before sighing.  
话语刚落，渚薰便从钢琴凳上跌落至地面。真嗣只是给了他一个不以为意的眼神，随后叹了口气。

"You know, you don't have to be so dramatic."  
"你知道的，没必要这么夸张。"

"Bu…." "但…."

"Yeah, I'm not following the usual routine, but no one's around so it doesn't exactly matter," Shinji gestured around to the ruins surrounding them "like it would matter here anyway?"  
"是的，我没有遵循常规程序，但周围没人，所以其实也没什么关系，" 真嗣向周围的废墟示意 "反正在这里也不会有人在意吧？"

"What routine?" Kaworu asked, his eyes growing ever wider.  
"什么常规？" 渚薰问道，他的眼睛越睁越大。

"Oh, you're probably from an earlier cycle," Shinji shrugged as he turned to face him fully, "never mind, we talk about Sinatra if people are around, helps keep our little secret. Listen you have to get me up to date, apparently, it's been 10 years, but…"  
"哦，你大概来自更早的循环吧，" 真嗣耸耸肩，转身完全面对着他，"没关系，我们在人前谈论辛纳屈，这样有助于保守我们的秘密。听着，你得帮我跟上进度，显然已经过去十年了，但是……"

"Enough!" Kaworu cut him off. Shinji couldn't remember ever witnessing a similar outburst before, though maybe he just didn't remember. "Shinji what's gotten into you?"  
"够了！" 渚薰打断了他。真嗣不记得以前见过类似的爆发，也许只是他不记得了。"真嗣，你怎么了？"

"_Oh, this is just gold." Asuka chimed in while leaning on the piano._  
"哦，这真是太精彩了。" 明日香一边靠在钢琴上一边插话道。

"_I can see him," Rei said softly, as she stared at Shinji, though her eyes were unfocused as if she was staring through Shinji._  
"我能看见他，" 丽轻声说道，目光凝视着真嗣，尽管她的眼神似乎并未聚焦，仿佛透过真嗣在看别的东西。

"_Quiet Wondergirl," Asuka barked._  
"安静点，奇迹少女，" 明日香厉声说道。

It took everything for Shinji to ignore the two, he forced himself to stay focused on the increasingly baffling child of Adam in front of him.  
真嗣竭尽全力忽视她们两人，他强迫自己专注于眼前这个越来越令人费解的亚当之子。

"You, me," he said pointing at himself and the boy still on the floor "known each other since I had to pop your head off with Unit-01, any of this ringing a bell?"  
“你，我，”他指着自己和仍躺在地上的男孩说，“从我不得不用初号机把你脑袋拧下来那天起就认识了，这些有让你想起什么吗？”

Kaworu's eyes widened, those red orbs suddenly giving Shinji a sinking feeling in his gut.  
渚薰的眼睛睁大了，那双红色的眼眸突然让真嗣心中一沉。

"It's you," he said softly.  
“是你，”他轻声说道。

"It's me what?" he asked, increasingly not liking this conversation.  
“是我什么？”他问道，越来越不喜欢这场对话。

"You're not this world's Shinji Ikari."  
"你不是这个世界的碇真嗣。"

"Yeah, of course, that's what I've been saying."  
"是啊，当然，我一直都是这么说的。"

"No, you don't understand, I remember when we first met…"  
"不，你不明白，我记得我们第一次见面的时候……"

Shinji rolled his eyes "Yes, congrats, we both do, I only stopped having nightmares about killing you the _first_ time after I realized you can't really die."  
真嗣翻了个白眼，“是啊，恭喜，我们都有，我只是在意识到你真的不会死后，才不再做关于第一次杀你的噩梦。”

"You know… about me?" “你知道……关于我？”

The pilot of Unit-01 pinched the bridge of his nose, doing his best to be patient with his longest acquaintance.  
初号机驾驶员捏了捏鼻梁，尽力耐心对待这位相识最久的人。

"Alright, let me spell this out for you since you're beating around the bush. You and I have been doing this since I realized that _you_ get reincarnated every life and _we_ have our little fun until eventually, I have to deal with you."  
"好吧，既然你拐弯抹角，我就直说了。自从我发现你每次转世都会回来，你我便一直这样，直到最后我不得不面对你。"

Kaworu's mouth just hung open there, looking at the boy.  
渚薰的嘴只是张开着，看着那个男孩。

"So, let's get this going again, what was your _last_ life like?"  
“那么，让我们重新开始吧，你上一世过得如何？”

The boy said nothing, he just stared at Shinji from the ground. Shinji has never seen that face from him before, the look of wonder, of confusion, and quite possibly hope? His eyes seemed to hold something else in them the ageless boy couldn't quite make out. When Kaworu finally opened his mouth, he spoke slowly, in an uncharacteristically wavering voice.  
男孩一言不发，只是从地上凝视着真嗣。真嗣从未在他脸上见过这样的表情，那种惊奇、困惑，或许还有希望？他的眼中似乎还藏着一些永恒的少年无法完全解读的东西。当渚薰终于开口时，他的语速缓慢，声音异常颤抖。

"You're from the start…" “你来自最初……”

Now it was the dark-haired boy's turn to look at him with confusion.  
现在轮到黑发男孩以困惑的眼神看着他了。

"What did you just say?"  
"你刚刚说什么？"

"Do you remember what I told you? That for me there is equal value in life and death."  
"你还记得我告诉过你的吗？对我来说，生与死有着同等的价值。"

Shinji's eyes tried to find something wrong, anything that might tell him that the boy sitting there was lying, a twitch, a look in his eye, anything, but all he could do was sigh.  
真嗣的眼睛试图找出什么不对劲的地方，任何可能告诉他那个坐在那里的男孩在撒谎的迹象，一个抽搐，一个眼神，任何东西，但他所能做的只是叹息。

"You're joking." Shinji just pinched the bridge of his nose. "I'm stuck here and all I got is _you_?"  
"你在开玩笑吧。" 真嗣只是捏了捏鼻梁。"我被困在这里，结果只有你陪我？"

Sighing, he stood up, Kaworu just watched him, like he was watching some sort of incomprehensible horror, but he felt no fear, only sadness.  
他叹了口气，站起身来，渚薰只是看着他，仿佛在看某种难以理解的恐怖景象，但他并不感到恐惧，只有悲伤。

"You've changed." "你变了。"

It was such a simple statement, one that should be obvious, for how long he had lived it should be expected, even necessary. But the Third Children couldn't help but feel a stab of shame come to him.  
这是一句如此简单的陈述，本应显而易见，毕竟他已活了那么久，这理应被预料到，甚至是必要的。但第三子不禁感到一阵羞愧刺痛心头。

"No, not really." He finally admitted, turning, he offered his hand to the boy on the floor.  
“不，并不是。”他终于承认道，转身向地板上的男孩伸出了手。

"C'mon, let's get things sorted out."  
"来吧，让我们把事情理清楚。"

_As Shinji helped his opposite up, Soryu continued to watch Rei who had graduated from simply staring unfocused at nothingness, to instead reaching through the air, batting at something.  
当真嗣扶起对面的人时，Soryu 继续观察着绫波，她已经从茫然地盯着虚无，转变为伸手在空中拍打某物。_

"_Why do you always have to be so weird?" She muttered and just followed the two boys._  
"你为什么总是这么奇怪？" 她低声嘀咕着，跟着两个男孩走了。

ʡʘʘʘʢ

Kaworu had insisted on moving away from well-cleared tunnels. Shinji followed the boy through more and more decerped spaces, even having the device Rei had given him hours earlier flare up from time to time.  
渚薰坚持要离开那些清理得很好的隧道。真嗣跟着他穿过越来越破败的空间，甚至不时感觉到几个小时前绫波给他的设备发出亮光。

The pale boy explained it was only light radiation, something Shinji had raised an eyebrow to.  
苍白的男孩解释说这只是光线辐射，这让真嗣不禁挑了挑眉。

Finally finding themselves on what seemed like the tallest pillar of rusting metal, Shinji promptly sat down on the decrepit catwalk with his legs dangling off the edge of the eroding rails.  
最终，他们来到了一个看似最高的锈蚀金属柱上，真嗣随即坐在破旧的走道上，双腿悬在腐蚀的栏杆边缘。

Kaworu eyed him with apprehension before being given an annoyed look from the Third Children. "Are you going to sit or just stand there gawking?"  
渚薰带着一丝忧虑地看着他，随即被第三适格者投以不悦的目光。“你是要坐下还是就站在那儿发呆？”

"I apologize, it's just so… jarring to see you…"  
“抱歉，只是……看到你……感觉太……突兀了。”

Eyeing the red-eyed boy Shinji frowned "What, able to start a conversation, talking without stuttering?"  
真嗣皱眉看着红眼男孩，“怎么，能开始对话了，不结巴地说话了？”

"So alive." "如此生机勃勃。"

Shinji rolled his eyes "Yeah I got a lot of life in me, are you gonna sit or what?"  
真嗣翻了个白眼，“是啊，我活力满满，你到底坐不坐？”

Cautiously the pale boy at cross-legged next to the one he remembered. It was so strange, he could still see that timid boy who could barely speak to him, the one who he knew couldn't bring people closer to his heart.  
小心翼翼地，苍白的男孩盘腿坐在了他记忆中的那个男孩旁边。这一切如此奇异，他仍能看见那个羞涩的男孩，几乎不敢与他说话，那个他知道无法让人靠近自己内心的男孩。

"What happened?" he asked. Shinji just sat there, hugging the railing post, the wind fluttering his clothes.  
"发生了什么？" 他问道。真嗣只是坐在那里，抱着栏杆柱子，风轻轻吹动他的衣服。

"What happened…" Shinji repeated, shaking his head.  
"发生了什么……" 真嗣重复道，摇了摇头。

"What do you remember?" Shinji asked, "How long have you been here?"  
"你记得什么？" 真嗣问，"你在这里多久了？"

"I've been here for over ten years." He said, "Ten years waiting for you."  
“我在这里已经超过十年了。”他说，“十年，只为等你。”

"Sure." Shinji scowled. "当然。" 真嗣皱眉道。

"I'm guessing you make a mistake," Kaworu said.  
"我猜你犯了个错误，" 渚薰说。

"Made a mistake? Shinji's scowl deepened "How the hell would you know?! You knew. You knew how damn fragile I was!"  
"犯了个错误？" 真嗣的眉头皱得更深了，"你怎么会知道？！你明明知道，知道我有多么脆弱！"

Kaworu looked at the boy, a pain where his heart should have been, it couldn't have been equal to the pain Shinji had felt though.  
渚薰看着那男孩，心中本该是心脏的位置却感到一阵痛楚，但这痛楚恐怕远不及真嗣所经历的痛苦。

"Were you there, or was it just my imagination?" he asked, his voice lowering, looking at Kaworu, "I've asked before, but I guess getting it from you would be the best answer."  
“你当时在场吗，还是只是我的幻觉？”他问道，声音低沉下来，目光投向渚薰，“我之前问过，但我想从你这里得到的答案才是最好的。”

Kaworu shook his head, "No, after our encounter in front of Lilith, I awoke in this world, such is fate."  
渚薰摇了摇头，“不，在我们于莉莉丝面前相遇之后，我便在这个世界苏醒了，这就是命运的安排。”

Shinji rolled his eyes at the mention of fate and continued "I was so tired, so done, I didn't care what happened, so when NERV and SEELE finally came to odds, the JSDF was tricked into attacking us. Long story short, I was given the choice by Rei, whether to allow instrumentality to happen."  
提到命运时，真嗣翻了个白眼，继续说道：“我当时太累了，彻底受够了，什么都不在乎了。所以当 NERV 和 SEELE 最终发生冲突时，自卫队被诱骗来攻击我们。简而言之，绫波给了我一个选择，是否允许人类补完计划发生。”

For a moment he just looked out over the ruins, the jagged rusted metal, and crumbling concrete that once was once the GeoFront.  
有那么一会儿，他只是凝视着废墟，那些参差不齐的锈蚀金属和曾经是地底都市的破碎混凝土。

"I accepted… but it wasn't what I wanted, after feeling everyone, everything… it took all that to realize how wrong I was. So, I rejected it and I woke up with Asuka on that beach… and I the next time I closed my eyes… I was dropping a payphone on that first day with NERV."  
“我接受了……但这不是我想要的，在感受了所有人，所有事物之后……这一切让我意识到自己错得多么离谱。于是，我拒绝了它，醒来时和明日香在那片海滩上……而当我再次闭上眼睛……我回到了加入 NERV 的第一天，掉落了那部公用电话。”

"I don't believe that," Kaworu said softly.  
"我不相信那一点，"渚薰轻声说道。

"Well, that's the truth."  
"好吧，那是事实。"

"Fate hasn't willed you back for no reason Shinji, there must be more."  
"命运不会无缘无故让你回来，真嗣，一定有更多的原因。"

"To hell with fate!" he shouted into the wind "What the hell am I supposed to do anyway, I tried to fix things, I've been trying to fix things for so long I'm forgetting my original life, there's no reason to this."  
“去他的命运！”他对着风吼道，“我到底该怎么做，我尝试过修复一切，我已经尝试修复太久了，以至于忘记了原本的生活，这一切毫无道理。”

Kaworu didn't react to the outburst, he just tilted his head "No, something happened, something you're not telling me."  
渚薰对这番爆发毫无反应，只是歪了歪头，“不，发生了什么事，有些事情你没告诉我。”

"Why would I lie about that, what do I have to gain?"  
“我为什么要为此撒谎，我能从中得到什么？”

"Nothing, but I think you need to remember, fate wouldn't send you through this hell for no reason."  
“什么也没有，但我认为你需要记住，命运不会无缘无故让你经历这场地狱。”

"It's a punishment." Shinji explained softly "for my failure, my sins."  
"这是惩罚。" 真嗣轻声解释道，"因为我的失败，我的罪孽。"

"No sin is too great to be forgiven."  
"没有罪孽是不可宽恕的。"

_Soryu just snorted behind the two of them.  
惣流只是在他们身后嗤之以鼻。_

"_I understand now," Rei said to herself, crouching next to Shinji, her hands still moving in the air. She clearly wasn't talking to any of them, but Soryu didn't seem to take too kindly to her behavior._  
"我现在明白了，" 丽自言自语道，蹲在真嗣旁边，双手仍在空中比划。她显然不是在和他们任何人说话，但副司令似乎对她的行为并不太满意。

"_Hey Wondergirl, how about you give him some space."_  
"嘿，奇迹少女，给他点空间怎么样。"

_Rei didn't respond, she just continued to stare, leaving Soryu to just shake her head.  
丽没有回应，只是继续凝视着，让副司令只能无奈地摇了摇头。_

Sighing, Kaworu stood up, "I want you to remember when you woke up, and what happened after, come tell me what you remember, then we can talk about it."  
叹了口气，渚薰站起身来，“我希望你记住醒来时的情景，以及之后发生的事，然后来告诉我你记得什么，我们再讨论。”

Shinji just watched the boy walk off, his mind reeling from the interaction. The two of them had never had such an interaction before. Usually, he was trying to get Kaworu to leave him alone. Shinji pondered what he had said, and thought back to the beach, but his mind was just left with blurry images.  
真嗣只是看着那个男孩走开，脑海中思绪翻涌。他们俩从未有过这样的交流。通常，他都在试图让渚薰离他远点。真嗣思索着渚薰的话，回想起海滩上的情景，但脑海中只留下模糊的影像。

Soon he followed suit, letting his feet take him back the way he came. Shinji slowly made his way back to his room, sitting down on the edge of his bed and he just let himself remember the worst day of his life. His mind raced back over his failures, his complete and utter failure to do what was needed.  
"不久，他也跟着照做，任由双脚带他回到来时的路。真嗣缓缓走回自己的房间，坐在床边，任由自己回忆起那最糟糕的一天。他的思绪飞速回溯着自己的失败，彻底未能做到该做的事。

He got Misato killed, it was his fault that she took a bullet to her chest all because he wanted to curl up in a corner and die.  
他害死了美里，她胸口中弹全是他的错，只因他想蜷缩在角落里等死。

He got Asuka killed… for a time he had blamed the fact that Unit-01 had been encased in bakelite, that wasn't his fault, but if he hadn't sat around feeling sorry for himself, he could have helped.  
他害死了明日香……有一段时间，他怪罪于初号机被封在树脂中，那并非他的错，但如果他没有自怨自艾，本可以伸出援手的。

It _was_ his fault. 这都是他的错。

The thought had occurred to him that if he had rejected instrumentality if he had kept the third impact from happening Asuka would've been dead, shredded by the MPEs.  
他曾想过，如果他拒绝了融合，阻止了第三次冲击，明日香就不会死，不会被使徒撕碎。

It didn't matter. 这无关紧要。

So many ifs, so many could have.  
太多的如果，太多的可能。

"_You're an idiot you know that?" Asuka said, standing in front of him, hands on her hips._  
“你知道你是个白痴吗？”明日香站在他面前，双手叉腰说道。

Shinji just looked up at her, "What?"  
真嗣只是抬头看着她，“什么？”

"_You forgot! Just like your father, 'People live on by forgetting'!"_  
"你忘了！就像你父亲一样，‘人们因遗忘而活’！"

"I didn't forget!" "我没有忘记！"

"_Yes you did, you_ are _your father's son! Tell him Rei!"_  
"你就是忘了，你是你父亲的儿子！告诉她，丽！"

Shinji just looked over to the girl who had planted herself right next to him. her hands still swirled in the air, and her eyes were laser-focused on something he couldn't see himself.  
真嗣只是瞥了一眼那个紧挨着他坐下的女孩。她的双手仍在空中旋转，双眼如同激光般聚焦在某样他自己看不见的东西上。

"_Rei do you want to speak up!?"_  
“丽，你想说就说出来吧！”

"_There is something… I believe I can help you remember," she said slowly before she twisted her hand, and his world went black._  
“有些事情……我相信我能帮你记起来，”她缓缓说道，随即扭动手腕，他的世界便陷入了一片黑暗。

**Well… that wasn't just one week.  
嗯……这可不止一个星期。  
Also, Chapter 50! We've come a long way!  
还有，Chapter 50！我们已经走了很长的路！  
**

**SHOUTOUTS! 特别鸣谢！**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – I feel Misato's attitude towards everyone and Shinji especially comes down to a self-protection mechanism. She's pushed Asuka away because the last time she got close to a pilot it went poorly, and as for thinking Shinji was on board with the HIP in some form, that's because she'll do mental gymnastics or delude herself into believing that. Better the boy who died in N3i was an enemy instead of someone she should care for.  
来自美国的 UltraSpink —— 我觉得美里对所有人，尤其是对真嗣的态度，是一种自我保护机制。她推开了明日香，因为上次她接近一个驾驶员时情况很糟糕，至于认为真嗣会以某种形式支持 HIP，那是因为她会进行心理体操或自欺欺人地相信这一点。与其说在 N3i 中死去的孩子是敌人，不如说她宁愿相信那是一个她不应该关心的人。**

**Mr. Moji – Thanks! And Happy New Year to you too.  
Moji 先生 —— 谢谢！也祝您新年快乐。**

**MooseTracks101 – Thanks! Unfortunately, Shiki's had a rough couple of years.  
MooseTracks101 – 谢谢！不幸的是，式这几年过得相当艰难。**

**Brother Bov – Thanks! Happy New Year to you too.  
Brother Bov – 谢谢！新年快乐，你也是。**

**YodaMorpheus7 – Misato just doesn't want to feel the pain of the boy she knew being gone, and once she had anything, even the possibility that Shinji wasn't who he said he was, I think Misato would have jumped on that if for nothing else, to just dull the pain.  
YodaMorpheus7 – 美里只是不想感受到那个她所认识的男孩消失的痛苦，一旦她有任何线索，哪怕是碇真嗣并非如其所言的可能性，我想美里也会抓住这一点，不为别的，只为减轻那份痛苦。**

**EvaPilotFair – Thanks!  EvaPilotFair – 感谢！**

**NoseGum – Yep, but a sad meanie. Thanks!  
NoseGum – 是的，但一个悲伤的小气鬼。谢谢！**

**Berix – Thanks! Berix – 谢谢！**

**JIM D. ZAS – Thanks!  
JIM D. ZAS – 谢谢！**

**calborhete – Thank you! The unrestricted meeting will be fun when we get there.  
calborhete – 谢谢你！当我们到达那里时，无限制的聚会将会很有趣。**

**engel17white – There's a lot of 'if's right now, but one day we'll see what made it in from 4.0.  
engel17white – 现在有很多‘如果’，但总有一天我们会看到从 4.0 中保留了什么。**

**Lupeskillz – Thanks! I think everyone needs a hug haha.  
Lupeskillz – 谢谢！我觉得每个人都应该来个拥抱，哈哈。**

**Attila1987 – Thanks! I too hated how no one seems to care Asuka died, it really is just confounding, hell not even Mari reacts. With Misato I can somewhat understand some actions, but ultimately I think a lot had to do with meta-messages, just like the rest of the movie.  
Attila1987 – 谢谢！我也讨厌没人关心明日香去世的情节，这真的很令人费解，甚至连真希波都没有反应。对于美里的一些行为，我多少能理解，但最终我认为这很大程度上与元信息有关，就像电影的其他部分一样。**

**TheHiddenLettuce – Mari the 60-year-old? Yikes. I think Asuka's physical abuse is not remembered well, I have a hard time remembering anything that wasn't played for gags, it's probably just more dramatized in fanfics, but hey I could be wrong.  
TheHiddenLettuce – 60 岁的真希波？哎呀。我觉得明日香遭受的身体虐待并没有被很好地记住，我很难记住那些没有被当作笑料的部分，可能在同人小说中被戏剧化地夸大了，不过我也可能错了。**

**Guest – Cringe to some, based to others.  
客人——有人觉得尴尬，有人觉得真实。**

**Guest – I have no idea what the first half of that review is referring to lmao. Anyways thanks!  
Guest – 我完全不知道那篇评论的前半部分在说什么，哈哈。总之谢谢啦！**

**skyf0x – Thanks! Great review like always. You mostly hit the nail on the head with Misato, the hypocrite (kinda like Shinji) and someone who is willing to believe something that lacks real evidence if it numbs her pain. One day we'll get those moments, the moments of her realizing how wrong she was, to both kids, and maybe she too can relate to them better afterward.  
skyf0x – 谢谢！一如既往的精彩评论。你对美里（有点像真嗣）的评价很到位，她是个伪君子，愿意相信缺乏真实证据的东西，只要能缓解她的痛苦。总有一天，我们会看到那些时刻，她意识到自己错得有多离谱，对两个孩子都是，也许那时她能更好地理解他们。**

**tomdj1701 – Thanks! tomdj1701 – 谢谢！**

**kempn200252 – Shinji and Misato butting heads in the future? Sounds like a plan.  
kempn200252 – 未来真嗣和美里会发生冲突？听起来挺有意思的。**

**Alright, up next, Shinji's Mind and what exactly happened after the beach, how did we get here, and the biggest question of all, what's the deal with Ghost Soryu? All these questions and more answered next time on Relapse! (or at least the next few chapters that's a lot of baggage to unpack in just one chapter honestly.)  
好了，接下来，我们将探讨真嗣的内心以及海滩事件后的具体经过，我们是如何走到这一步的，还有最大的疑问，幽灵薰究竟是怎么回事？所有这些问题，以及更多内容，将在下一期《复发》中得到解答！（或者至少在接下来的几章里，因为要在短短一章中解开这么多包袱，说实话，确实有点多。）**

**Until Next Time 下次再见**


### Chapter 51: "…Him and me, alone …"  
Chapter 51: "…他和我，单独在一起…"

"What?" “什么？”

Shinji blinked rapidly, trying to clear his blurry vision. For a fleeting moment, a stab of worry went through him, before his vision cleared and he was left staring up at a ceiling.  
真嗣快速眨眼，试图清除模糊的视线。在转瞬即逝的担忧中，他的视野终于清晰起来，发现自己正凝视着天花板。

A familiar ceiling. 一个熟悉的屋顶。

Groaning, he pushed himself off the floor and looked around, knowing exactly where he was supposed to be, but unable to truly comprehend it. Trash was littered everywhere, the small table, the two fridges, Misato's apartment appeared no better than how he always found it. This time however he knew this wasn't real.  
他呻吟着，从地板上撑起身来，环顾四周，明明知道该在哪里，却无法真正理解。垃圾散落一地，小桌子上，两台冰箱旁，美里小姐的公寓看起来一如既往地凌乱。然而这一次，他知道这不是真实的。

"_What the hell did Wondergirl do?"_ Asuka asked. She was looking around too, and just stood over top of him not batting him an eye.  
“这到底是怎么回事？明日香做了什么？”明日香问道。她也在四处张望，只是站在他上方，没有看他一眼。

"Your guess is as good as mine." Shinji mumbled as he looked for a path through the garbage. He examined himself, he wasn't dressed in the pilfered jumpsuit, he wasn't even dressed in his usual white shirt. No, he was wearing a red collared shirt and jeans.  
"你的猜测和我的一样。" 真嗣咕哝着，试图在垃圾中找到一条路。他打量了一下自己，没有穿着那件偷来的连体衣，甚至连他平常的白衬衫也没穿。不，他现在穿着一件红色领衬衫和牛仔裤。

How bizarre. 真是奇怪。

"_Do you think…"_ Soryu was swiftly cut off by the sound of the doorbell ringing through the apartment.  
"你觉得…" 丽的声音被门铃声迅速打断，铃声在整个公寓里回荡。

They eyed each other before Shinji just shrugged and began his trek to the door, nearly tripping on empty beer cans along the way to the entry hallway. A frown grew on his face as he soldiered on, the garbage not having been cleared from here either, instead, it grew thicker, like someone had been stuffing it here instead of throwing it out.  
他们互相对视了一眼，随后真嗣只是耸了耸肩，开始向门口走去，途中差点被散落的空啤酒罐绊倒。他皱起眉头，继续前行，这里的垃圾也没有被清理，反而越积越多，仿佛有人一直在往这里塞垃圾而不是扔出去。

It kept getting deeper till he was practically wading up to his knees in filth, lucky enough it didn't smell, but he was getting annoyed, especially while the doorbell kept ringing. Kicking enough trash to clear a small spot in front of the door, he opened it only to be completely baffled as to what he saw next.  
垃圾越来越深，直到他几乎要趟过膝盖深的污秽，幸运的是这里并不臭，但他越来越烦躁，尤其是门铃还在不停地响。他踢开足够的垃圾，在门前清出一个小空地，打开门后，眼前的一幕让他完全愣住了。

Red. 红色。

That was the first thing he registered.  
那是他首先注意到的事情。

A splattering of red on their chest.  
胸前一抹鲜红。

And an emptiness. Where the balconies and other appartements should be there was only a blank world, devoid of anything and standing there just beyond the threshold… Shinji Ikari.  
还有一片空虚。本该是阳台和其他公寓的地方，只剩下一个空无一物的世界，就站在门槛之外……碇真嗣。

The boy was wearing his usual attire, but the splattering of blood soaking into the shirt distinguished the two appart.  
男孩穿着他平时的衣服，但衬衫上浸染的血迹将两者区分开来。

They just stood face to face for a moment, each looking the other up and down, before his bloody doppelganger pushed past him and into the apartment.  
他们面对面站了一会儿，各自上下打量着对方，然后那个满身是血的替身从他身边挤过，进了公寓。

"How polite," Shinjij mumbled as he closed the door behind him and made the treacherous journey back to the kitchen. His uninvited guest has stopped in the doorway, leaving Shinji to push past him.  
“真有礼貌，”真嗣嘀咕着，在他身后关上门，艰难地回到厨房。他的不速之客停在门口，留下真嗣从他身边挤过。

"_Have you seen this fridge?"_ Asuka asked, having opened it and examining the lush shelves filled with anything he could imagine. She hadn't noticed the third person yet, but once she stood up and turned she stopped, looking back and forth between the two.  
"你见过这个冰箱吗？" 明日香问道，她已经打开冰箱并仔细查看了里面琳琅满目的货架，里面摆满了她能想象到的任何东西。她还没注意到第三个人，但当她站起来转身时，她停住了，来回打量着两人。

"_What…"_ Asuka could only say one word before their guest walked forwards, wide-eyed, completely ignoring the trash that he waded through, before stopping in front of her and reaching out.  
"什么……" 明日香只能说出这一个词，因为他们的客人向前走来，睁大了眼睛，完全无视了他趟过的垃圾，最后停在她面前，伸出手来。

Asuka did nothing as his fingers neared the bandages of her arm, she said nothing as they inched ever closer. The increasing shaking of his hand had not gone unnoticed and she couldn't help but let a subdued sigh escape her as he pulled his hand back, like he had had just brushed against a flame.  
明日香没有任何动作，任由他的手指接近她手臂上的绷带，她一言不发，任由它们越来越近。他手的颤抖没有被忽视，她忍不住轻叹一声，他像刚触碰到火焰一样缩回了手。

"How?" he started, but his words were lost, while Asuka just frowned.  
"怎么回事？" 他刚开口，话音却被淹没，而明日香只是皱了皱眉。

"_I'm not mistaking it right? This is from_ that _night?_" she turned to Shinji who just nodded.  
"我没弄错吧？这是那晚的事？" 她转向真嗣，后者只是点了点头。

"What night?" the other boy said, his toned conveying his annoyance.  
“什么晚上？”另一个男孩说道，语气中透露出他的不悦。

"it's just…" "只是……"

Shinji's words were cut short by the sound of a yelp and something crashing. The trio looked at each other, then moved to the living room to peer down the hallway the noise had come from.  
真嗣的话被一声惊叫和什么东西倒下的声音打断了。三人面面相觑，然后走向客厅，朝传来噪音的走廊望去。

Shinji Ikari was slowly picking himself up, the torn door told them all it needed to.  
碇真嗣正缓缓地站起身来，那扇被撕裂的门已经说明了一切。

"I'm sorry about the door Misato… but why is there so much trash?" he said as he found his footing, only to see five eyes staring at him.  
“真抱歉，美里，门的事……不过，这里怎么这么多垃圾？”他稳住脚步，却迎上了五双眼睛的注视。

This Shinji was just as he should have been, with the usual white shirt and black pants, there were no stains, nothing to tell them he was anything different. His reaction did leave a bit to be desired, however.  
这个真嗣正如他应有的样子，穿着平常的白衬衫和黑裤子，没有污渍，没有任何迹象表明他与往常不同。然而，他的反应确实有些不尽如人意。

"What's going on?" he asked, that face morphing into one of confusion. The voice held such a timid tone, one that brought Shinji back to a time before all this. Before Eva's, before Angels, before secret plots and being caught in a cycle. It brought him back to how he was before.  
“发生了什么？”他问道，脸上的表情转为困惑。他的声音带着如此胆怯的语调，让真嗣回想起这一切发生之前的日子。在 EVA 之前，在使徒之前，在秘密阴谋和陷入循环之前。让他回想起曾经的自己。

The blood-stained Shinji turned away from the group, choosing to instead look around the apartment, or maybe that's just what he wanted them to think. Neither Shinji nor Asuka was oblivious to the glances he was giving her, the looks that lingered for a moment too long.  
血迹斑斑的真嗣转身离开人群，选择环顾公寓四周，或许这只是他想让他们这么认为。无论是真嗣还是明日香，都没有忽视他投向她的目光，那些停留过久的凝视。

"_So what do you make of this?"_ Asuka leaned over to him, making a mockery of the exchange.  
"那你觉得这是怎么回事？" 明日香向他倾身，嘲弄着这场对话。

Shinji just pinched the bridge of his nose. "None of this is real, it's all up here," he said tapping his temple.  
真嗣只是捏了捏鼻梁。"这一切都不是真的，都在这里，"他说着敲了敲自己的太阳穴。

"_Wondergirl can't help but give you head games even here huh?"_  
"就连在这里，绫波也不忘给你玩心理游戏，是吧？"

Shinji shrugged and went back to the kitchen, before promptly tripping over a stack of beer cans again. Grumbling from the ground, he flicked off the bits of ramen as he pushed himself up before opening cabinets to search for garbage bags.  
真嗣耸了耸肩，回到厨房，结果又一次被一堆啤酒罐绊倒了。他一边从地上咕哝着，一边弹掉身上的拉面碎屑，然后撑起身来，打开橱柜寻找垃圾袋。

"_You're really going to clean?"_ Asuka asked in bemusement.  
“你真的要打扫？”明日香带着几分好奇问道。

Shinji shrugged as he tossed an empty ramen cup into the black bag. "It'll help me think, besides, you got any bright ideas?"  
真嗣一边将空拉面杯扔进黑色垃圾袋，一边耸了耸肩。“这样能帮我思考，再说，你有什么好主意吗？”

She just frowned before Shinji watched her wade through the refuse and into the living room. The boy had the table cleared in no time, bottles, empty ramen containers, and beer cans all found themselves shoved into the bag haphazardly.  
她只是皱了皱眉，随后真嗣看着她穿过垃圾堆，走进客厅。男孩迅速清理了桌子，瓶子、空拉面盒和啤酒罐都被胡乱塞进了袋子里。

Glancing up after a while he noticed Asuka struggling to open the door to Misato's room, which stubbornly refused to budge. At the same time, his first doppelganger was in the same situation trying to open what would have been Asuka's room, while the still timid third Shinji only stared at each of them, though he noted how his eyes lingered on Soryu the most.  
过了一会儿，他抬头看到明日香正费力地试图打开美里房间的门，但那门固执地纹丝不动。与此同时，他的第一个分身也在同样的情况，试图打开明日香的房间，而依旧胆怯的第三个真嗣只是盯着他们，尽管他注意到自己的目光更多停留在 Soryu 身上。

Shaking his head, Shinji tossed two full bags of trash into the living room, causing a domino effect on every empty bottle and can in the room. The cacophony of the noise caused everyone to jump and brought three gazes to fall on him.  
真嗣摇了摇头，将两个装满垃圾的袋子扔进客厅，引发了一连串的空瓶和空罐倒下的连锁反应。这阵嘈杂声让所有人都吓了一跳，三双眼睛齐刷刷地落在他身上。

"Kitchen's clear." He announced, putting a bit of cheesy bravado in his voice, "no thanks to you guys."  
"厨房已经收拾干净了。" 他带着几分夸张的自信宣布，"这可不关你们的事。"

Seeing the only cleared space in the apartment, each member of their group staggered to it, finally relieved to be released from the claws of the garbage. Shinji just leaned back against the counter, observing the bloodied version of himself open the fridge, while the timid version just took a seat, still stealing glances at the bandaged redhead.  
看到公寓里唯一被清理出来的空间，他们小组的每个成员都踉跄着走向那里，终于从垃圾的魔爪中解脱出来，感到一阵轻松。真嗣只是靠在橱柜上，观察着那个血迹斑斑的自己打开冰箱，而那个胆小的版本则坐了下来，仍然不时偷瞄着那个缠着绷带的红发女孩。

"So, I know you," Shinji said, pointing at the boy going through the fridge, "bathtub, right?"  
"所以，我认识你，" 真嗣指着正在翻冰箱的男孩说，"浴缸那次，对吧？"

His doppelganger froze, like a rabbit caught in the gaze of a fox.  
他的分身僵住了，宛如一只被狐狸盯上的兔子。

"Just so you know," Shinji said, reaching over and laying a hand on his shoulder, "that was a long time ago."  
“只是让你知道，”真嗣说着，伸手搭在他的肩上，“那是很久以前的事了。”

He wasn't surprised when his opposite just shrugged off his shoulder and scowled, "Let me guess mind games?"  
当他的对立面只是耸耸肩甩开他的手并皱眉说“让我猜猜，心理游戏？”时，他并不感到惊讶。

Shinji just nodded. 真嗣只是点了点头。

"Figures, Lilith can't leave me alone." The blood-stained boy grumbled, as he picked out a beer and took it to the table. Shinji raised an eyebrow but this wasn't real, so what did it matter?  
“意料之中，莉莉丝就是不让我安宁。”血迹斑斑的男孩咕哝着，拿起一瓶啤酒走向桌子。真嗣挑了挑眉，但这里毕竟不是现实，有什么关系呢？

"You," Shinji now turned to his unstained version, who slunk back in his chair at the sudden realization he was the center of attention, "where are you from?"  
“你，”真嗣转向未沾血迹的自己，对方在突然意识到成为焦点后缩回了椅子里，“你从哪儿来？”

"I don't know what you mean." He answered, it sounded truthful, but it still confused him.  
“我不明白你的意思。”他回答道，听起来很真诚，但仍让他感到困惑。

"Which life are you from?"  
"你是从哪个生命来的？"

"Life?" "生命？"

"Yeah, life." "对，生命。"

"I still don't understand."  
“我还是不明白。”

"_Hey dummkopf, how about you tell us instead what you've been up to recently, that'll help,"_ Asuka spoke up, annoyance clear in her voice.  
"嘿，傻瓜，不如你告诉我们你最近在忙什么，这样更有帮助，" 明日香开口说道，语气中的不耐烦显而易见。

"Um…" Shinji watched as his eyes tried to shy away from her bandages, but it was a hopeless battle. "I um, the 14th Angel. I fought it in the GeoFront."  
"呃…" 真嗣看着他的眼睛试图避开她身上的绷带，但这注定是一场徒劳的战斗。"我，呃，第 14 使徒。我在 GeoFront 与它战斗。"

"_Alright good."_ Asuka said, _"now how many times had you done that before?"_  
"好吧，很好。" 明日香说，"那你之前做过多少次这样的事？"

He just gave her a confused face. "I mean you and me had sync training to fight one, and we fought that one in the ocean."  
他只是困惑地看着她。“我是说你和我进行过同步训练来对抗使徒，而且我们在海上与其中一个战斗过。”

"_No idiot, how many times have you died and started over again!"_ Asuka barked.  
“不，傻瓜，你已经死了多少次又重新开始了！”明日香厉声说道。

"I don't know what you're talking about." He said, trying to slink back into his chair more "I've just been piloting for a few months."  
“我不知道你在说什么。”他说着，试图更深地缩回椅子里，“我只驾驶了几个月。”

Everyone in the kitchen looked at him dumbfounded before Shinji's bloodied doppelganger broke the silence, "You gotta be shitting me, you're from the first life?"  
厨房里的每个人都目瞪口呆地看着他，直到浑身是血的另一个真嗣打破了沉默，"你一定是在开玩笑吧，你是来自第一世的人？"

"Um." "嗯。"

"Does the name Kaworu mean anything to you?" he asked, the boy just shook his head, "alright mystery solved, but you," he continued, pointing at Asuka, "Is she real?"  
"你听说过‘薰’这个名字吗？"他问道，男孩只是摇了摇头，"好吧，谜团解开了，但是你，"他继续说着，指向明日香，"她是真实的吗？"

"_Yes"_ "是的"

"No." "不。"

"Well, that clears up a lot." The doppelganger mumbled sarcastically, taking a drink of his beer.  
"嗯，这下清楚多了。" 那个冒牌货讽刺地咕哝着，喝了一口啤酒。

Shinji turned to look through some more cabinets, finding them stocked full of ingredients, something he really hadn't expected considering the state of the apartment being that of before he had started living with Misato.  
真嗣转身继续查看其他橱柜，发现里面堆满了食材，这让他颇感意外，毕竟考虑到公寓在他与美里同居前的状态。

"_What are you doing Third?"_ Asuka asked.  
"你在干什么，三号？" 明日香问道。

Shinji pulled out some noodles and seasoning, "I'm gonna cook." He said simply, "It'll help me think of a way out of this mess."  
真嗣拿出一些面条和调料，“我要做饭。”他简单地说道，“这能帮我思考如何摆脱这个困境。”

"_But what are we doing here anyway? Wondergirl said this was going to help you remember, not help stick you in a psych ward." She growled, "I mean you're literally talking to yourself."_  
“但我们到底在这里做什么？绫波说这会帮你记起来，不是把你送进精神病院。”她咆哮道，“我是说，你简直在自言自语。”

Shinji shrugged as he cleaned the countertop of rubbish and started boiling water. What did this have to do with remembering, how could he have forgotten in the first place? When had he forgotten? Was it him or was it time?  
真嗣耸耸肩，一边清理着台面上的垃圾，一边开始烧水。这与记忆有什么关系？他怎么会忘记的？他何时忘记的？是他自己还是时间的问题？

He had two points of his life in the room with him. Why?  
他的生命中有两个重要时刻与他同处一室。为何如此？

What exactly was he supposed to do with them? He had already been through those moments, experienced those things, how was this helping?  
他究竟该如何处理这些时刻？他早已经历过那些瞬间，体验过那些事情，这又如何能帮到他？

"So, what's going on?" he heard the timid voice behind him as he pulled out a set of knives and began to cut up some ingredients while setting some rice on the stove to cook.  
“那么，这是怎么回事？”他听到身后传来怯生生的声音，同时他抽出一组刀具，开始切配食材，并将一些米放在炉子上煮。

"This isn't real." the other version of himself said simply.  
"这不是真的。"另一个自己简单地说道。

"_It's real, but not for you."_ Asuka corrected.  
"它是真实的，但对你而言不是。"明日香纠正道。

"I'm real, I know that." the second Shinji countered.  
"我是真实的，我知道这一点。"第二个真嗣反驳道。

"_Sure, you are, what life are you at?"_ Asuka asked.  
"当然，你是，你现在处于哪一生？" 明日香问道。

"Wait." The timid Shinji interrupted, "What are you all talking about? What does that mean, 'multiple lives?'"  
"等等。" 胆小的真嗣插话道，"你们在说什么？'多重生命'是什么意思？"

Shinji's cutting stopped, and the apartment went silent. It was as if the air had been sucked out of all of them like all life had vacated the room. Shinji turned his head, just so he could see the other two of them looking at the timid boy.  
真嗣的切割声戛然而止，公寓陷入一片死寂。仿佛空气被抽离，所有生命都从房间中撤离。真嗣缓缓转头，只为瞥见另外两人正注视着那个怯懦的男孩。

He could only see the sadness in each of their eyes.  
他只能看到他们每个人眼中的悲伤。

"Why are you looking at me like that?" the boy asked, clearly unnerved by the reactions he was getting from those around him.  
“你们为什么那样看着我？”男孩问道，显然被周围人的反应弄得心神不宁。

"He's only made it to Zeruel…" the bloodied Shinij said slowly as if he needed to remind them, "It hasn't happened for him yet."  
“他只到了 Zeruel……”满身血污的 Shinij 缓缓说道，仿佛需要提醒他们，“对他来说，那件事还没发生。”

The youngest Shinji just continued to look at them, Asuka, whose face had slowly contorted into a scowl.  
最年幼的 Shinji 只是继续盯着他们，Asuka 的脸渐渐扭曲成了一副怒容。

"We lost… didn't we?" "我们输了……是吧？"

This time, neither of the Shinjis could look him in the eye, but Asuka could.  
这一次，两位真嗣都无法直视他的眼睛，但明日香可以。

"_What?"_ “什么？”

"We lost." He said again, "Kaji said if an Angel got below NERV HQ, the Third Impact would wipe out the world."  
“我们输了。”他又说了一遍，“加持说过，如果使徒侵入 NERV 总部下方，第三次冲击将会毁灭世界。”

Asuka's scowl suddenly morphed into a sickly smile, _"Oh, how cute, you think it was the Angels, don't you?"._  
明日香突然皱眉变成了病态的微笑，“哦，真可爱，你以为那是使徒干的，对吧？”

"What else would it be? We're fighting the Angels."  
"还能是什么？我们正在与使徒战斗。"

"Asuka." Shinji said, sending a warning message.  
"明日香。" 真嗣说道，传递出一个警告的信号。"

"_He deserves… no, he should know, he should know exactly what he did."_ She spat back at him.  
"他应该……不，他必须知道，他必须清楚自己做了什么。" 她回敬道。"

"What, what do I need to know?"  
"什么，我需要知道什么？"

Asuka crept towards the boy, bending down to get level with his eyes.  
明日香悄悄地向男孩靠近，弯下腰来与他目光平齐。

"It wasn't an Angel that started the Third Impact, it wasn't even your father, who, I might add, most definitely wanted it to happen. It wasn't NERV and all the shady things they've been doing behind the scenes." Asuka explained slowly, still inching towards him.  
"引发第三次冲击的不是使徒，甚至不是你父亲，我得说，他绝对希望它发生。也不是 NERV 和他们幕后那些见不得人的勾当。" 明日香缓缓解释道，依旧一步步向他逼近。

"It was you; you killed the world."  
"是你；你毁灭了世界。"

His face morphed into confusion and he looked over to see the older versions of him refusing to make eye contact.  
他的脸上露出困惑的表情，转头看向那些年长的自己，他们拒绝与他目光相接。

"She doesn't mean that… we wouldn't do that… I wouldn't do that!"  
"她不是那个意思……我们不会那么做的……我不会那么做的！"

The bloodied Shinji took another drink before crushing his can, "She's telling you the truth." he said simply, "No one forced us… then again," he looked up to Asuka now "no one helped us either."  
浑身血迹的 Shinji 又喝了一口，然后捏扁了手中的罐子，“她在告诉你真相。”他简单地说道，“没人强迫我们……不过，”他抬头看向 Asuka，“也没人帮助我们。”

Asuka straightened up from being level with the timid Shinji and glared at the other boy sitting at the table as if daring him to say another word.  
Asuka 从与胆怯的 Shinji 平视中挺直身子，瞪着坐在桌旁的另一个男孩，仿佛在挑衅他再说一句话。

"But that doesn't make any sense!" the boy cried, "Why would we, I, do that?"  
“但这说不通！”男孩喊道，“我们，我，为什么要那样做？”

Asuka continued her staring contest, both of them ignoring the confused boy, as Shinji turned around with four bowls of rice.  
明日香继续她的瞪眼比赛，两人都无视了困惑的男孩，真嗣转过身来，手里拿着四碗米饭。

"Here," he said, handing a bowl to the youngest version of himself, "try this."  
“给，”他说着，递给年幼的自己一碗，“试试这个。”

They all looked up at him, their faces showing the bewilderment of his casual tone. He just shrugged, none of this was real, none of them were really here, he'd had plenty worse experiences in his head before, so why worry?  
他们都抬头看着他，脸上露出对他随意语气的困惑。他只是耸了耸肩，这一切都不是真的，他们都不在这里，他以前在脑海中经历过更糟糕的事情，所以为什么要担心呢？

"I'm not very hungry." the youngest version said, to which he just shrugged, he couldn't really blame the kid.  
“我不太饿。”最小的那个说道，对此他只是耸了耸肩，确实不能怪这孩子。

"I am." the other remarked, snatching two bowls and beginning to scarf them down.  
“我饿了。”另一个说着，抓起两个碗就开始狼吞虎咽。

Asuka just made her way to the fridge once more, this time leaning against his with her arms crossed. Shinji took his own bowl and leaned against the counter, eating slowly, while keeping an eye on each of them. Despite the peace right now, somehow, he just knew the questions would keep coming.  
明日香再次走向冰箱，这次她双臂交叉靠在他的冰箱上。真嗣拿起自己的碗，靠在厨房的柜台上慢慢吃着，同时留意着他们俩。尽管此刻平静，不知为何，他就是知道问题会接踵而至。

"How long have you been doing this?" The youngest one spoke up.  
“你做这个多久了？”最年轻的那位开口问道。

The question caught him off guard, and he paused while at the counter, unaware that all eyes were on him now. "What was that?"  
这个问题让他措手不及，他在柜台前停了下来，没有意识到所有的目光现在都集中在他身上。“那是什么？”

"You kept asking how many times I lived, so I want to know… how long have you been going?"  
“你一直在问我已经活了多少次，所以我想知道……你已经进行了多久？”

"I don't really know, I used to count," Shinji smiled sadly, "somedays it doesn't feel so long, then… sometimes…"  
“我真的不知道，我曾经数过，”真嗣苦笑着，“有些日子感觉并不长，然后…有时候…”

"Six hundred and seventy-one." the second Shinji said, staring at him.  
“六百七十一。”第二个真嗣盯着他说道。

"Well…" “嗯……”

"You forgot?!" he started, pushing himself up from the table, his eyes boring into his opposite.  
"你忘了？！" 他猛地从桌边站起，目光如炬地盯着对面的人。

"Things happened." "事情发生了。"

"Like what?" the boy growled at him. There it was, he remembered that raw emotion he used to harbor, that anger that could burn so bright. The boy was as much a ghost to him now as his redheaded phantom, like the unquenched emotion that had propelled him for so long, he that had become a fleeting memory. Shinji remembered the temper, the hate he had harbored. He just never thought he'd be on the opposite end of it.  
"比如什么？" 男孩对他咆哮道。他记得那种原始的情感，那股曾经熊熊燃烧的怒火。如今，这男孩对他而言如同红发幽灵般虚幻，就像那股长久以来推动他的未熄情感，已化作转瞬即逝的记忆。真嗣记得那股脾气，那份憎恨。他只是从未想过自己会成为这怒火的靶心。

"Like how that shirt is stained, or did you forget what you just let happen?"  
"就像那件衬衫上的污渍一样，还是你忘了刚刚发生的事？"

"Why would you even allow yourself to…"  
"你为什么要让自己……"

"Because I have enough nightmares already!" Shinji shouted.  
"因为我已经有够多噩梦了！" 真嗣喊道。

ʡʘʘʘʢ

The youngest Shinji watched as Asuka glided away from the argument raging in the kitchen. The bandaged girl slowly made her way into the living room, uninterested in the flaring tensions around the table. He watched in mild fascination as she tried to slide open Misato's door, but found it wouldn't budge.  
最年幼的真嗣看着明日香从厨房里激烈的争吵中滑步离开。缠着绷带的女孩缓缓走向客厅，对餐桌周围紧张的气氛漠不关心。他略带好奇地看着她试图滑开美里小姐的门，却发现门纹丝不动。

He could almost detect a feeling of dejection as she walked away, this time making her way down the hallway between their two rooms, not bothering to even acknowledge him as she went.  
他几乎能察觉到她离开时的沮丧情绪，这次她径直走向他们两个房间之间的走廊，甚至没有费心向他打招呼。

Neither of the other boys noticed as the boy got up from his seat and peered down the hall, observing as she stood in front of her own room with her hand on the door, but unwilling to open it. He had just tried, there was no way she was going to open it either.  
其他两个男孩都没有注意到，这个男孩从座位上站起来，探头望向走廊，观察着她站在自己房间门前，手放在门上，却不愿意打开。他刚刚试过了，她也不可能打开的。

For a few moments she did nothing, and Shinji stole the moment to look over the bandages again and again, unsure of how she could have been hurt but feeling a pit in his stomach just seeing them.  
有那么一会儿，她什么也没做，这让真嗣趁机一遍又一遍地检查起绷带来，尽管不确定她是怎么受伤的，但看到这些绷带，他的胃里就感到一阵翻腾。

Without warning, the girl forcefully slid the door to the side, its wooden frame crashing against its stops. Again, she stood there, peering into her room, examining the sight that was obscured for him, but she entered soon after.  
毫无预警地，女孩用力将门向旁边一滑，木制的门框猛地撞在门挡上。她再次站在那里，凝视着自己的房间，审视着对他来说模糊不清的景象，但很快她就走了进去。

No one noticed his absence, not when the other two were too busy shouting at each other, and when he reached the door Asuka didn't know notice him either at first. She was sitting at the edge of her bed, just looking down at a torn raggedy doll in her hands.  
没有人注意到他的缺席，毕竟另外两人正忙着互相争吵，而当他走到门口时，明日香一开始也没有注意到他。她坐在床边，只是低头看着手中那只破烂的布娃娃。

Shinji looked around, there was a strange dichotomy to the room. On one hand, the bed was made, not a wrinkle marred the surface of the covers, the floor was almost as spotless as well, but the furniture was a different matter entirely. Every piece was a mess, clothing hung out, drawers were opened, each surface was covered in everything from makeup to school supplies.  
真嗣环顾四周，房间里有一种奇怪的二重性。一方面，床铺整理得一丝不苟，床单上没有一丝皱褶，地板也几乎一尘不染，但家具却是另一番景象。每件家具都凌乱不堪，衣物随意挂着，抽屉敞开，每个表面都堆满了从化妆品到学习用品的各种物品。

"_What do you want?"_ “你想要什么？”

Shinji's eyes snapped to the redhead, who still held the doll in her hands, but now her gaze was laser focused on him. He froze, for the first time Asuka's eye wasn't carrying the weight of judgment, in fact, it wasn't carrying much of anything.  
真嗣的目光猛地转向红发女孩，她手里依然抱着那个娃娃，但此刻她的目光如激光般聚焦在他身上。他僵住了，这是第一次，明日香的眼神没有带着评判的重量，实际上，几乎什么都没有。

"I just…" he swallowed, "I couldn't get in here before."  
"我只是……" 他咽了咽口水，"我之前一直进不来这里。"

"_Well, here it is."_ She said simply.  
"好了，就是这里。" 她简单地说道。"

The boy just stared into that eye, possibly a second too long as it narrowed.  
男孩只是盯着那只眼睛，可能盯得稍微久了些，因为那眼睛眯了起来。

"_It's the bandages."_ “是绷带。”

"Um… no, no it's…." "嗯……不，不，它是……"

"_You're such a bad liar,"_ she said, standing up, _"I'd forgotten about that, these days it's as easy as breathing for you."_  
"你真是个糟糕的说谎者，" 她站起身来，"我差点忘了，这些天对你来说就像呼吸一样自然。"

He averted his eyes, turning slightly, "What happened?"  
他移开视线，微微转身，"发生了什么？"

Asuka said nothing, she just made her way to her mirror, leaning against the dresser and stared at the reflection.  
明日香一言不发，只是走向她的镜子，倚靠在梳妆台上，凝视着镜中的自己。

"_Why do you care?"_ “你为什么在乎？”

"I just… I want to know."  
“我只是……我想知道。”

"_What do you think?"_ "你怎么看？"

"An Angel?" "一个天使？"

"_No."_ "不。"

"What else?" "还有什么？"

"_Another Eva."_ "另一个 Eva。"

"but how…" "但怎么……"

"_Because you couldn't get off your ass and help!"_ she hissed, looking back at him, _"You couldn't even do that right, 'poor Shinji feeling sorry for himself,"_ she said in a mocking tone. _"I needed you. More than ever, more than Zeruel I needed you then, and you did_ nothing_."_  
"因为你连站起来帮忙都做不到！" 她低声怒斥，回头瞪着他，"你连这点事都做不好，'可怜的 Shinji 自怨自艾'，" 她用嘲讽的语气说道，"我需要你，比以往任何时候，比对 Zeruel 更需要你，而你却什么都没做。"

"I…" "我…"

"_What? Never thought you could do that? Go on tell me that it'll never happen."_  
"什么？没想到你能做到这一点？来吧，告诉我这永远不会发生。"

"I'm sorry Asuka." "对不起，Asuka。"

The girl just narrowed her eyes, _"Don't you…"_  
女孩只是眯起了眼睛，“你难道不……”

"I'm sorry I wasn't there for you." he said again, "I… I don't know why I wouldn't, but it couldn't have been right."  
“对不起，我没能在你身边。”他又说了一遍，“我……我不知道为什么我会不在，但那肯定不对。”

"_Then why did you jump in a volcano after me? What made you do it then?_" she asked, _"You jumped in before you knew I needed you then, so what was it Third?"_  
“那你为什么会在我之后跳进火山？是什么让你那么做的？”她问道，“你在知道我需要你之前就跳了进去，那是什么原因，Third？”

He said nothing, he just rubbed his arm. Before he caught his breath from her next question.  
他一言不发，只是揉了揉手臂。还没等他喘口气，她的下一个问题又来了。

"_What did you feel when we kissed?"_  
“我们接吻时，你感觉到了什么？”

"I..." the boy swallowed while Asuka continued to watch him, looking for anything that could tell her what he couldn't say. Or at least, she thought he couldn't say.  
“我……”男孩咽了咽口水，而明日香继续盯着他，试图从他的表情中捕捉到他难以言说的情感。至少，她以为他无法说出口。

"I… was terrified." He confessed, "but… I liked it… and I didn't know what to do."  
"我……害怕极了。" 他坦白道，"但是……我喜欢那种感觉……而我不知该如何是好。"

The girl said nothing, and just looked back at the mirror, leaving Shinji standing there, before a shout pulled his attention back to the hallway.  
女孩一言不发，只是回头看着镜子，留下真嗣站在那里，直到一声喊叫将他的注意力拉回到走廊上。

"Are you two down there?"  
"你们俩在下面吗？"

The boy made his way to the hallway and nearly missed the lack of garbage clogging the ground along the way, "Yeah," he said, and looked back to call Asuka. Except all he met was the sliding door.  
男孩走向走廊，差点没注意到一路上地面不再被垃圾堵塞，“是啊，”他说着，回头想叫明日香。然而，他只看到了滑动门。

ʡʘʘʘʢ

"Because I have enough nightmares already!"  
“因为我已经有够多噩梦了！”

Neither one of the boys noticed the younger version of themselves slip away with Asuka, but then again it was hard to pull any attention away from the near shouting match they now found themselves in.  
两个男孩都没注意到年幼的自己与明日香悄然离去，不过话说回来，他们现在正陷入一场近乎争吵的对峙中，实在难以分心。

"Why did you forget about it all?"  
"你为什么全都忘了？"

"I didn't!" "我没有！"

"Then why haven't you kept track?"  
"那你为什么没记下来？"

"What's the last thing that happened to you?" Shinji asked his bloody counterpart.  
“你最近发生了什么事？”真嗣问他的血腥分身。

He froze, the feelings of what had just happened coming forth. "Asuka… she…."  
他僵住了，刚刚发生的事情的情感涌上心头。“明日香……她……”

"Yeah, and we did that, we're responsible," Shinji said, gathering their dishes.  
“是啊，而且我们做了那件事，我们有责任，”真嗣说着，收拾起他们的餐具。

"No… its worse." He said, "Can you even remember why we did that?"  
“不……更糟了。”他说，“你甚至还记得我们为什么要那么做吗？”

"Because she didn't need us, she was better off without us," Shinji explained as he cleaned a few knives.  
"因为她不需要我们，没有我们她会过得更好，" 真嗣一边解释，一边擦拭着几把刀。

"Are you sure?" the bloodied boy asked, "there was more."  
"你确定吗？" 满身血迹的男孩问道，"还有更多。"

"It felt…" "那种感觉…"

"Good. didn't it?" He answered for him, "After everything she did to us, it felt good to hurt her, why?"  
"很好，不是吗？" 他替他回答，"她对我们做了那么多，伤害她感觉很好，为什么？"

Shinji shook his head, this was ridiculous. "That was a long time ago."  
真嗣摇了摇头，这太荒谬了。"那是很久以前的事了。"

"Was it?" "是吗？"

"What do you think happened after that?" Shinji asked, "You were going up to the roof to do what exactly?"  
"你觉得之后发生了什么？" 真嗣问道，"你上屋顶到底是要做什么？"

The bloodied boy stayed silent.  
那满身血迹的男孩沉默不语。

"Or did you already do it?" he asked, "I lost track because I lost hope… for a long time I did nothing but run away again. Over and over, just trying to reach the end of… whatever this is."  
"还是你已经做了？" 他问道，"我失去了追踪，因为我早已失去了希望……很长一段时间里，我除了再次逃跑什么也没做。一次又一次，只是试图到达……无论这是什么的尽头。"

"And then what happened?"  
“然后发生了什么？”

Shinji stopped cleaning and felt the edges of his lips curl slightly, "She saved me."  
真嗣停止了打扫，嘴角微微上扬，心想：“是她救了我。”

"Who?" “谁？”

Shinji looked around and finally gestured towards Asuka's room, the sound of the other half of their group talking was dampened by the walls, but it was enough to tell him where they were.  
真嗣环顾四周，最终指向了明日香的房间，虽然墙壁减弱了另一部分他们的谈话声，但足以让他知道他们在哪里。

"You're joking." "你在开玩笑吧。"

Shinji shook his head "As stupid as it sounds, it's the truth. She might not really be here, but she stopped me. Do you know what it's like to…"  
真嗣摇了摇头，"听起来很蠢，但这是真的。她可能并不真的在这里，但她阻止了我。你知道那是什么感觉吗……"

He turned back to the bloodied boy but found no one. He twisted around fully, looking for where his other might have gone, but found nothing. Shinji peaked into the hallway leading to the front door, but the only oddity was the lack of garbage, the same was true for the living room.  
他转回身看向那个满身血迹的男孩，却发现那里空无一人。他完全转过身来，寻找另一个可能去的地方，却什么也没找到。真嗣探头看向通往前门的走廊，但唯一奇怪的是那里没有垃圾，客厅也是如此。

"Are you two down there?"  
"你们俩在下面吗？"

ʡʘʘʘʢ

They found themselves in the living room, there was no trash, no refuse anywhere in the apartment. They just sat there across from one another, and Shinji was left with nothing to say.  
他们发现自己身处客厅，公寓里没有垃圾，也没有任何废弃物。他们只是面对面坐着，而真嗣无话可说。

"It's just you and me then huh?" the timid boy said.  
“看来只剩下你和我了，是吧？”胆怯的男孩说道。

"Yeah," Shinji said rubbing the back of his neck. What were they left? Even Asuka was gone now. As his mind flared with question after question, he felt the gaze of his companion on him. "You still have a question, don't you?"  
“嗯，”真嗣揉着后颈说道。他们现在还有什么？就连明日香也不在了。随着脑海中一个接一个的问题涌现，他感觉到同伴的目光落在他身上。“你还有问题，对吧？”

"Why?" "为什么？"

Shinji blinked, "Why what?"  
"真嗣眨了眨眼，“为什么什么？””

"Why did you do it?"  
"“你为什么要这么做？””

Shinji knew exactly what he was talking about and just sighed.  
"真嗣清楚他在说什么，只是叹了口气。”

"No one forced you to do it right? So, what happened?"  
“没人逼你这么做，对吧？那，发生了什么？”

He said nothing, thinking of the best possible answer he could give to explain it the best he could, "I made a mistake."  
他一言不发，思索着能给出的最佳解释，尽可能地表达清楚，“我犯了个错误。”

"_You call that a mistake?"_  
“你管那叫错误？”

"There had to be more!"  
“肯定不止如此！”

"I did it because I thought… nothing mattered, that…" he turned away, "It doesn't matter, you wouldn't understand."  
"我这么做是因为我觉得……什么都不重要，那……" 他转过身去，"无所谓了，你不会懂的。"

"But I'm you." "可我就是你啊。"

"_The only person who can sympathize with you and understand you, is you."_  
"唯一能同情你、理解你的人，就是你自己。"

Shinji sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose and closing his eyes, just remembering, "I think everything just… broke me. I had nothing but regret, and everywhere I looked there was only pain."  
真嗣叹了口气，捏着鼻梁闭上眼睛，只是回想起，“我觉得一切……都把我击垮了。除了悔恨，我一无所有，放眼望去尽是痛苦。”

Shinji opened his eyes to an empty space, the room and apartment were gone as white raced out in all directions. Only his former self sat there with him, a confused face all he had to show for that confession.  
真嗣睁开眼，发现自己身处一片空旷之地，房间和公寓都消失了，四周白茫茫一片。只有过去的自己坐在那里，那张困惑的脸是他唯一的回应。

At that moment he looked so innocent, he didn't know the true horrors of the world, the true intentions of those around him. The boy in front of him didn't carry the burdens of his sins nor the pain of his failures.  
那一刻，他看起来如此纯真，对世界的真正恐怖、周围人的真实意图一无所知。眼前的男孩没有背负他的罪孽，也没有承受他失败的痛苦。

The boy in front of him had died a long time ago, and he had been the one who killed him.  
他面前的男孩早已死去很久，而正是他亲手结束了他的生命。

The words that came next came on their own, unable to be stamped out, and yet as they rolled of his tongue, Shinji knew they were the right words to say.  
接下来的话语自然而然地涌出，无法被压制，然而当这些话从他口中滚落时，真嗣知道这些话是正确的。

"I'm so sorry." He said quietly, "I'm so sorry I couldn't be better…. And I'm sorry for what we became, you deserved better."  
“我很抱歉。”他轻声说道，“我很抱歉我没能变得更好……我也为我们的结局感到抱歉，你应该得到更好的。”

"So why did you do it?"  
"那你为什么这么做？"

"Because the world hurts. It burns and claws at you, nothing can change that, it took the best in us and gave it hope only to crush it." Shinji explained, "I lost everything, even hope."  
"因为世界令人痛苦。它燃烧着，撕扯着你，没有什么能改变这一点，它夺走了我们最美好的部分，给予希望却又将其粉碎。" 真嗣解释道，"我失去了所有，甚至包括希望。"

"And it wasn't till everyone was gone that I realized it was worse," he continued "a hopeless existence, there was no meaning, no point. It was better to feel pain from existing than float in a numbness."  
“直到所有人都离开，我才意识到情况更糟，”他继续说道，“那是一种无望的生活，毫无意义，没有目标。与其在麻木中漂浮，不如因存在而感到痛苦。”

"But you chose?" "但你选择了？"

"What?" “什么？”

"You chose to come back?"  
"你选择回来了？"

"I did." "是的。"

"Then what?" "然后呢？"

"I…" Shinji stopped, the static that had been where the memory should be was still there, but it began to clear. In front of him, the memory from a past life began to fade as the world he had woken up to materialized for him.  
"我…" 真嗣停了下来，本应是记忆所在处的静电噪音依旧存在，但开始逐渐消散。在他面前，前世的记忆开始淡去，而他醒来所处的世界则逐渐清晰起来。

He took a breath, feeling the ghostly sensation of sand between his fingers.  
他深吸一口气，感受着指间沙粒的幽灵般的触感。

"I made another choice." “我做出了另一个选择。”

**DevilOlantern – Yep, definitely a lot of flashbacks in 3.0, that's why after the next two chapters, there'll be no more for Shinji (hopefully). Shikinami's story is in the past though, so her chapters are mainly flashbacks anyways, not a whole lot happens for WILLE in the present, plus those between years are fun to explore.  
DevilOlantern – 没错，3.0 里确实有很多闪回，所以希望在接下来的两章之后，真嗣不会再有（希望如此）。虽然式波的故事发生在过去，但她的章节主要是闪回，WILLE 在现在没发生太多事，那些年间的插叙倒是挺有趣的。**

**A bit trippy this chapter, hope it was relatively easy to follow who was saying what, but I guess the important thing is that it was clear to everyone that this is just happening in Shinji's head.  
这章chapter有点迷幻，希望相对容易跟上谁在说什么，但重要的是大家都清楚，这一切只是发生在真嗣的脑海中。**

接下来……EoE 之后发生了什么！我们终于在两部分中得到了答案！**

**Until Next Time 下次再见**

### Chapter 52: "…Can't even cry from the pain…"  
Chapter 52: "…连因疼痛而哭泣都做不到…"

The sand shifted under his feet as he willed himself to take one more step. He'd been telling himself the same lie for hours now.  
沙子在他脚下移动，他强迫自己再迈出一步。几个小时以来，他一直在对自己重复着同样的谎言。

One more step, then they could rest.  
再走一步，他们就能休息了。

One more step for her.  
对她来说，再走一步。

That one wasn't a lie.  
那一句并非谎言。

She hadn't said anything since the beach, not one word, why should she?  
自从在海滩之后，她一句话也没说，何必呢？

"_Disgusting."_ "恶心。"

He was. There was nothing more to say, no apology for his sins and he found his tears soon dried up once he heard that word leave her lips.  
他是。再没什么可说的了，他的罪行无从道歉，而当他听到她口中吐出那个词后，泪水很快便干涸了。

One more step. 再走一步。

He had gotten off of her and turned away, knees against his chest, he had sat there till the first inkling of light made its way over the crimson ocean. She hadn't moved either, though when he had finally been able to look at her he had seen how much she wanted to.  
他从她身上下来，转身背对着她，双膝紧抱胸前，就这样一直坐到第一缕曙光划破绯红的海面。她也没有动弹，尽管当他终于能直视她时，他看到了她有多么渴望起身。

Every movement was agony for her, Shinji had only felt a fraction of what she had felt when Unit-02 was torn apart, and then when she had been disemboweled from the spears. He could only imagine how her body felt now and judging by the phantom pains in his palms he knew she was in no shape to move on her own.  
对她来说，每一次移动都是痛苦的折磨，真嗣只感受到了她当时被二号机撕裂和被长矛贯穿腹部时所承受的痛苦的一小部分。他只能想象她现在的身体感受如何，而从他手掌中的幻痛判断，他知道她无法自行移动。

He made sure to move slowly at first, his hands digging into the sand under her back with the smallest movements. Doing his best to lift her all the while that singular blue eye watched him, judged him, tried to dissect him.  
他一开始尽量缓慢移动，双手轻轻插入她背后的沙子中。他竭尽全力抬起她，而那只独特的蓝眼睛始终注视着他，评判着他，试图剖析他。

He didn't care. Not one bit.  
他毫不在乎。一点儿也不。

Because right now she needed him and he had failed her so many times before.  
因为此刻她需要他，而他之前已经让她失望过太多次了。

Soon they were moving, the cruicified MPEs and image of Rei floating over the water forgotten. Their tracks stretching along the beach with the slow lapping of waves hitting the sand being the only noise to grace their ears besides the occasional wince from Asuka.  
很快他们开始移动，被钉在十字架上的 MPEs 和水中漂浮的丽影像已被遗忘。他们的足迹沿着海滩延伸，只有缓缓拍打着沙滩的海浪声，以及偶尔从明日香那里传来的痛呼，成为他们耳畔唯一的声响。

They stopped periodically, more rest for her than for him, and during those times he knew that eye was glued to him, trying to decipher what he was doing.  
他们不时停下来，更多是为了让她休息而非他，而在那些时刻，他知道那双眼睛紧盯着他，试图解开他在做什么的谜团。

As dusk began to fall, he could spot some semblance of intact structures in the distance. A day's journey north had only shown then ruins of civilization so far, Tokyo-03 and the surrounding providences had been annihilated by the black moon and accompanying destruction, this must have been just beyond the devastation.  
随着黄昏降临，他能看到远处有些许完好的建筑轮廓。向北一天的行程只展示了文明的废墟，东京-03 及其周边省份已被黑月及其伴随的破坏所摧毁，这里必定是灾难之外的地方。

As best he could tell it must've been a town set up after the Second Impact, the 'new' buildings being the telltale sign of its occupant's relocation due to rising sea levels. They had the end in sight, but as he moved forwards he felt her resting more and more weight on him, unable to keep up with his rejuvenated enthusiasm.  
据他所知，这必定是第二次冲击后建立的小镇，那些“新”建筑是居民因海平面上升而搬迁的明显标志。他们即将到达终点，但随着他前进，他感到她越来越依赖他，无法跟上他重燃的热情。

It wasn't like he hadn't been holding the bulk of her before, but by now she must have been exhausted. He looked over at the mess of red hair next to him and then back to the village, they needed to reach it by nightfall or they'd have to spend the night out here.  
虽然他之前也抱过她大部分时间，但到现在她肯定已经筋疲力尽了。他瞥了一眼身旁那一团红发，然后又望向村庄，他们需要在夜幕降临前到达那里，否则就得在这荒郊野外过夜了。

Ever so delicately, he shifted, keeping her on her feet while moving in front of her and crouching.  
他小心翼翼地移动，让她保持站立的同时，自己则挪到她前面并蹲下。

"Hop on." “上来吧。”

She did nothing, just rested all her weight on his shoulders. Shinji couldn't tell if it was her pride refusing the help, or her disdain for him.  
她什么也没做，只是将全身重量都压在他的肩膀上。真嗣无法分辨，这是她的自尊拒绝帮助，还是她对他的轻蔑。

"Asuka," he pleaded, "we need to get there, you'r…" he stopped, if he told her she couldn't make it, it might anger her, she may even not let him help her. "Just hold onto me, we need to get there before dark."  
"明日香，" 他恳求道，"我们得赶到那里，你……" 他顿住了，如果告诉她她撑不住了，可能会激怒她，甚至不让他帮忙。"就抓紧我，我们得在天黑前赶到。"

At first, there was no response, before he felt her grip his shoulders slightly, and the rest of her weight lowered gingerly onto his back. Even with the glacial speed, he could hear her wince with every movement. Then her arms came down around his neck before he stood up and forced himself to keep moving.  
起初，没有任何回应，直到他感觉到她轻轻抓住他的肩膀，其余的重量小心翼翼地压在他的背上。尽管动作缓慢如冰川移动，他仍能听见她每动一下都倒抽一口凉气。随后，她的双臂环抱住他的脖子，他站起身来，强迫自己继续前行。

He wasn't what anyone would consider strong, he was slim even for his age, and while every fiber of his body wanted nothing more than to collapse from the day's journey, and now with Asuka's full weight he wouldn't allow himself to.  
他并非人们眼中的强壮之人，即便以他的年纪来看也显得瘦削。尽管身体的每一根纤维都渴望在一天的跋涉后倒下，但此刻承受着明日香全部的重量，他不允许自己这样做。

Perhaps it was adrenaline, perhaps it was his need to not fail her again, but he continued on, with only her labored breath in his ear.  
或许是肾上腺素的作用，又或许是他不愿再次让她失望的迫切，他继续前行，耳边唯有她沉重的呼吸声相伴。

One more step. 再走一步。

He focused on his steps, and every moment the images of her shredded Unit-02, of the haven that had become her tomb, all because he wouldn't do anything.  
他专注于自己的步伐，每一刻脑海中都浮现出她那被撕裂的 Unit-02，那个变成了她坟墓的避风港，全因为他不愿采取任何行动。

With the sun dipping just beyond the horizon he had made it into town and Shinji made his way to the nearest structure. The apartment building was small, no it was tiny, at least compared to Misato's, not more than three levels, but lucky for them nearly all the doors were hanging open.  
随着太阳渐渐沉入地平线，他已抵达镇上，并朝着最近的建筑物走去。这栋公寓楼很小，不，应该说是迷你，至少与美里小姐的那栋相比，不超过三层，但幸运的是，几乎所有的门都敞开着。

Stumbling inside, the place was predictably smaller than Misato's, but still spacious. The kitchen was to his immediate left when he walked in, blending into the living room just after that. A small table was situated just in front of him and a doorway led to what he could only assume was the bedroom to his right.  
跌跌撞撞地走进去，这里果然比美里小姐的住处小，但依然宽敞。进门后，厨房就在他的左手边，紧接着与客厅融为一体。一张小桌子正对着他，而右边的一扇门，他猜测应该是通往卧室的。

Opening it, he felt relief flood over him at the sight of a bed, and gently lowered the girl off his back. The movements all caused the sharp intake of breath from her, he was certain she was in more pain than she let on, but he knew asking her about it would get little or no response. But even as he left her and made his way to the kitchen to look for food, Shinji was keenly aware that her single blue eye was watching him.  
他打开门，看到床的那一刻，如释重负的感觉涌上心头，轻轻地将女孩从背上放下。她的每一次动作都伴随着痛苦的吸气声，他确信她承受的痛苦比表现出来的要多，但他知道询问她只会得到很少或没有回应。尽管如此，当他离开她去厨房寻找食物时，真嗣敏锐地感觉到她那只蓝色的眼睛一直在注视着他。

Shinji allowed himself to bask in the cool air that came at him as he opened the fridge. The last semblance of cold was released and with no way to chill the sparsely packed fridge. No power meant a lot of things, but that was the least of their worries.  
真嗣让自己沉浸在打开冰箱时迎面而来的凉爽空气中。最后一丝冷气被释放出来，由于没有电源，冰箱里稀疏的物品无法再被冷藏。没有电力意味着很多事情，但这还不是他们最担心的问题。

They hadn't seen anyone else on their day's journey. Not a single sign of life had greeted them. Surely more would come back, they wouldn't be the only ones.  
他们在这一天的旅途中没有见到任何人。没有一丝生命的迹象迎接他们。当然，会有更多的人回来，他们不会是唯一幸存的。

He pushed that thought aside for now and grabbed two bottles of water, before heading back to his companion. Kneeling down next to the bed he opened both, drinking from his and offering her the other.  
他暂时将这个念头搁置一旁，拿起两瓶水，然后回到同伴身边。跪在床边，他打开了两瓶水，自己喝了一瓶，并将另一瓶递给她。

"You need to drink." “你需要喝水。”

Bringing the water forward she didn't move, all she did was stare at him, that one blue eye emotionless at it bore into his soul.  
她将水递上前，却没有动，只是盯着他，那只蓝色的眼睛毫无情感，仿佛直视着他的灵魂。

"Asuka." He pleaded to no response, she just kept staring at him.  
“明日香。”他恳求着，却未得到回应，她只是继续凝视着他。

He wanted to know what was going on behind that eye, what was she thinking? Was she thinking of a way to keep them safe while everyone came back? Was she still trying to process Instrumentality?  
他想知道那双眼睛背后隐藏着什么，她在想什么？她是否在思考如何保护他们，直到所有人归来？还是在努力理解人类补完计划？

He watched as she blinked, and the iris followed him as he screwed the caps back on the waters.  
他看着她眨眼，当他在水壶上拧紧盖子时，她的瞳孔随着他的动作移动。

What did she think of him?  
她对他有什么看法？

Was she thinking of a way to kill him? Was she just replaying his stupid choices over and over in her mind?  
她是在想怎么杀了他吗？还是在她脑海中一遍遍重播他那些愚蠢的选择？

Did she even want to be next to him?  
她甚至想待在他身边吗？

The sudden string of thoughts mixed with the long-overdue finally allowed the day's journey to catch up to him. His muscles ached as he pushed himself up and drowsiness came over him.  
一连串突如其来的思绪混杂着久违的疲惫，终于让这一天的奔波追上了他。他强撑着酸痛的肌肉起身，困意如潮水般袭来。

He kicked off his shoes, having disregarded the engrained act of leaving them by the door, he laid down to the left of her. A sense of déjà vu came over him like he was reliving the moment she crawled into bed next to him all those months ago. Only this time he wouldn't run away, half of him didn't want to, the other half was too tired to care.  
他踢掉鞋子，不顾长久以来进门脱鞋的习惯，在她左边躺下。一种似曾相识的感觉涌上心头，仿佛重温了几个月前她爬上床躺在他身边的那个瞬间。只是这一次，他不会逃跑，一半的他不想离开，另一半则已疲惫到无暇顾及。

For a few moments she kept her back to him, and he felt his eyelids begin to grow heavy. Just as they began to close, they sprung back open as she rolled over, blue meeting blue. Again she was staring at him, there was no discernable emotion on her face, she wore no disgust or hope, no happiness or dejection.  
有那么一会儿，她背对着他，他感到眼皮开始变得沉重。就在它们即将闭合之际，她翻身过来，蓝色对上蓝色。她再次凝视着他，脸上没有任何明显的情绪，既无厌恶也无希望，没有喜悦也没有沮丧。

It was just her. 就是她。

And he wanted his eyelids to drop, but her gaze forced him to keep his own open and as much as he didn't want to admit it, there was a fear as well.  
他希望自己的眼皮能垂下，但她的目光迫使他不得不睁开双眼，尽管他不愿承认，但内心确实有一丝恐惧。

The fear that she wouldn't be there when he woke up.  
害怕醒来时她已不在身旁。

With all his courage he brought himself closer to her, the bandaged right arm was under her figure, perhaps the pressure helped, but her left hand was between them now, the only barrier.  
鼓足所有勇气，他让自己更靠近她，包扎着的右臂在她身下，或许是压力使然，但她的左手此刻正夹在他们之间，成了唯一的屏障。

Every so slowly, Shinji rested his right hand over hers, there were no intertwined fingers, no squeezing of palms, simply one hand over top the other, dried LCL flakes brushing off with the contact. She didn't object, at least not from what Shinji could tell.  
极其缓慢地，真嗣将右手轻轻覆在她的手上，没有交缠手指，也没有紧握手掌，仅仅是将一只手叠放在另一只之上，干燥的 LCL 碎片随着接触纷纷脱落。她并未反对，至少在真嗣看来是如此。

"I won't leave you again," he whispered, "I promise."  
"我不会再离开你了，"他低声说道，"我保证。"

ʡ.ʢ

For one instant, shorter than one could blink, shorter than anyone has generated a thought… Shinji Ikari believed that everything had been a nightmare.  
有那么一瞬间，比眨眼还短，比任何人的思绪生成还要快……碇真嗣相信这一切都只是一场噩梦。

Until his vision was awash with red.  
直到他的视野被一片红色淹没。

And the memory of yesterday came rushing back.  
昨日的记忆如潮水般涌回。

Asuka's eye was closed, having fallen asleep at some point, her hair was in disarray, patchy from the dried LCL, but her hand was still in the same spot, she hadn't shaken his off.  
明日香闭着眼睛，不知何时已入睡，头发凌乱不堪，沾满了干涸的 LCL，但她的手依旧停留在原处，没有松开他的手。

He didn't move, all he did was stare, stare at this girl whose mind and soul had been torn apart and put back together.  
他一动不动，只是凝视着，凝视着这个心灵与灵魂已被撕裂又重新拼凑的女孩。

All because of him. 一切都是因为他。

The image of Unit-02 ripped in the open GeoFront flashed in his mind, causing him to shake, but he forced himself to calm down, for her sake. They laid there together, there was no clock he could see, so he just let time pass, only examining her beautiful face, torturing himself with a reminder of his actions.  
二号机在 GeoFront 被撕裂的画面在他脑海中闪现，让他颤抖，但他强迫自己冷静下来，为了她。他们一起躺在那里，他看不到任何时钟，于是就让时间流逝，只是凝视着她美丽的脸庞，用自己行为的提醒折磨自己。

That was before that blue iris opened and was looking at him again.  
那是在那朵蓝色鸢尾再次绽放并凝视着他之前的事了。

At first there was a flurry of confusion, perhaps she had the same thought as him, that it had all been a dream for one fleeting moment.  
起初是一阵混乱，或许她和他有着同样的念头，以为这一切都只是一瞬间的梦境。

They stared into each other, both trying to understand what the other wanted to say.  
他们凝视着彼此，都在试图理解对方想要表达的意思。

"You didn't leave." "你没离开。"

Those were the only words said. The only words since he had been on top of her at the beach. He nodded slowly, there was nothing else to say, at least there was nothing she was going to say to him.  
那是唯一说出口的话。自他在海滩上压在她身上以来，这是唯一的话。他缓缓点头，无话可说，至少她没打算对他说什么。

Pushing himself up, gently helped her get up as well, before assisting her to the kitchen table. Scrounging for food, he produced a few snacks and set them down between them, but neither one started eating, their appetites understandably suppressed.  
他撑起身，轻柔地扶她起来，然后帮她走到厨房桌前。翻找食物时，他拿出几样零食放在两人之间，但谁也没有动口，食欲显然被压抑了。

Sitting there his eyes couldn't meet hers, so he just fiddled with a snacks packaging, "We should talk…"  
坐在那里，他的目光无法与她相接，于是他只是摆弄着零食包装，“我们该谈谈……”

Her brow furrowed, obviously, she didn't want to.  
她皱起眉头，显然，她并不愿意。

"Look I know…" "听着，我知道……"

"What do you know? She hissed at him across the table.  
"你知道什么？她隔着桌子对他低声怒斥。

He stopped fiddling with the package and finally looked up to see her glare. Leaning onto the table, his hands coming up to his face, in some way he must have looked like the late commander.  
他停止了摆弄包裹，终于抬起头迎上了她的怒视。他倚靠在桌子上，双手捂住脸，某种程度上，他看起来一定像那位已故的指挥官。

"I know that was you, what you said… you meant every bit of it." He started, "And I know I needed your help."  
“我知道那是你，你说的那些话……你每一句都是认真的。”他开口道，“我也知道我需要你的帮助。”

"And?" "然后呢？"

"And I don't deserve it… but I want to try... I know.."  
“我不配得到它……但我想要尝试……我知道……”

"You know nothing." She spat at him, as she suddenly tried to push herself up.  
“你一无所知。”她朝他啐了一口，突然试图撑起自己。

He only needed to see the shaking of her arms to know how much it was hurting her and she didn't look that stable either. It was all he needed to rush around the table, doing his best to try and help her, but all he felt was her bandaged fingers around his neck.  
他只需看到她手臂的颤抖，便能知晓这疼痛有多剧烈，而她的状态也并不稳定。这一切促使他绕过桌子，竭尽全力试图帮助她，却只感受到她缠着绷带的手指环绕在他的脖颈上。

That anger at him had boiled up and had this been yesterday on the beach he would have let her finish him if she had the strength. Now it was just pathetic, the light pressure he felt was inconsequential and he was sure this was hurting her more than it was hurting him.  
那份对他的愤怒曾沸腾至极，若是在昨日的海滩上，他或许会任由她了结自己，只要她有力气。如今这不过是可悲，他感受到的轻微压力无足轻重，他确信这伤她比伤他更深。

Had she done this been yesterday he would have let her do what she pleased, but right here, right now, he finally had someone other than himself to worry about. She needed him now, and he wouldn't fail her again, never again.  
若是在昨日，她想做什么他都会随她，但此刻此地，他终于有了除自己以外需要牵挂的人。她现在需要他，他不会再让她失望，绝不再犯。

With ease he pulled her hand away from his neck, Shinji was sure she had stopped trying once he moved, but that eye kept glaring at him, unwilling to do anything else.  
他轻易地从脖子上拉开了她的手，碇真嗣确信她在他动作时已停止了挣扎，但那只眼睛依旧怒视着他，不愿做其他事。

"Please Asuka… let me help you."  
"请麻里佳…让我帮你吧。"

"Like you could help me," she snarled "you can't even help yourself."  
"就像你能帮我似的，"她咆哮道"你连自己都帮不了。"

It was the truth, he was pathetic, but that didn't mean he couldn't do anything for her.  
这是事实，他很可悲，但这并不意味着他不能为她做些什么。

"So why come back?" he asked her.  
"那为什么回来？" 他问她。

There was no answer for him no witty remark, no insult, just silence. Just that emotionless stare to answer him.  
他没有得到回答，没有机智的反驳，没有侮辱，只有沉默。只有那毫无情感的凝视回应着他。

"Why come back?!" he asked more forcefully. "I saw you Asuka, I saw you, all of you, you must have felt something to come back!"  
"为什么回来？！" 他更加强硬地问道。"我看到了你，明日香，我看到了你，全部的你，你一定感受到了什么才会回来！"

"I did." She said plainly.  
"我确实看到了。" 她平淡地说道。

"You saw me then. You never talked to me; all you ever did was push me away!"  
"那你当时看见我了。你从未和我交谈过；你所做的只是把我推开！"

She said nothing. 她一言不发。

"I'm still… I want to try… for the first time in my life I don't want to run away…" he said simply, "I don't want to run anymore."  
"我仍然…我想尝试…这是我第一次不想逃避…" 他简单地说，"我不想再逃了。"

She finally stopped trying to force her hand around his neck, she didn't seem to have much energy for anything by then.  
她终于停止了试图强行将手环绕在他脖子上，那时她似乎已经没有太多力气去做任何事了。

"I'm yours Asuka, all of me." He swallowed "I promise. I'll always be there… I'm yours."  
"我是你的，明日香，全部的我。" 他咽了咽口水，"我保证。我会一直在那里…我是你的。"

They stood there silently, his arms supporting her, while she did nothing. Not too long ago, he figured this was exactly what she wanted, now, it seemed she wanted anything but this.  
他们静静地站在那里，他的手臂支撑着她，而她却什么也没做。不久前，他以为这正是她所渴望的，如今，她似乎除了这个什么都想要。

"I need to wash off." She said simply, brushing off a few flecks of LCL.  
“我需要洗一洗。”她简单地说道，拂去几片 LCL 的碎屑。

Shinji just nodded and slowly walked her to what he presumed was the bathroom. Walking inside it was small, but a full tub was a promising start. Bringing a chair, he let her sit down, even with the discomfort on her face, he knew it was only temporary.  
真嗣只是点点头，慢慢地带她走向他猜测是浴室的地方。走进去一看，虽然空间狭小，但有一个完整的浴缸是个不错的开始。他搬来一把椅子，让她坐下，尽管她脸上流露出不适，他知道这只是暂时的。

Asuka brought her hand up to her wrist and tried to release her plug suit, the audible click resounded in the cramped room but nothing happened, the damage seemingly too much for it to continue functioning properly.  
明日香将手伸向手腕，试图脱下插入栓服，房间内回荡着清晰的咔嗒声，却毫无动静，损坏似乎过于严重，以至于它无法正常运作。

She looked up at him, glaring with that blue eye "You just going to stand there, or get out?" she growled.  
她抬头瞪着他，那只蓝眼睛闪烁着怒火，“你就打算站在那儿，还是滚出去？”她咆哮道。

"You can't do this on your own." He said simply, "so let me help you."  
“你一个人做不到的。”他简单地说，“所以让我帮你。”

She frowned, looking away into the mirror and seeing the sorry state she was in for the first time. Her face fell at the sight and Shinji could see the dejection creep onto it. She just shook her head in reluctance acceptance "Fine. It's not like you haven't seen it before." She spat, referring to his actions she had seen in instrumentality.  
她皱起眉头，转向镜子，第一次看到了自己狼狈的样子。这一幕让她脸色一沉，真嗣能察觉到她脸上的沮丧逐渐蔓延。她只是无奈地摇了摇头，勉强接受道：“好吧。反正你也不是第一次见到了。”她带着讽刺的口吻说道，暗指他在融合状态中的所作所为。

The boy visibly cringed at the words, obviously feeling the guilt from his actions. Turning to leave, Asuka grumbled as she worked at the skintight suit, of course, he would go back on what he had just said.  
听到这些话，男孩明显畏缩了，显然为自己的行为感到内疚。转身离开时，明日香一边抱怨一边努力脱下紧身衣，果然，他又要反悔刚才的话了。

To her surprise, however, he reappeared at the door, scissors in his hands and a look on his face, waiting for her permission to start.  
然而，令她惊讶的是，他再次出现在门口，手里拿着剪刀，脸上带着等待她允许开始的神情。

She turned away again but nodded.  
她再次转过身去，但点了点头。

Starting at her neck, Shinji delicately began to cut away at the plug suit, making sure not to nick the girl.  
从她的颈部开始，真嗣小心翼翼地切割着插入栓服，确保不会伤到女孩。

Starting at her shoulder, he worked his way over to her neck, then he started back down, slicing his way down the right side of her torso. He made sure to do so delicately, there was no need to hurry, and the shaking of his hands didn't help the situation. As he went, the vacuum seal loosened and the synthetic material peeled away from her body as he worked.  
他从她的肩膀开始，一路轻柔地移向她的脖颈，随后又折返向下，沿着她躯干的右侧划去。他小心翼翼地进行着，无需急躁，而双手的颤抖也无助于事态。随着他的动作，真空密封逐渐松动，合成材料在他手下从她身体上剥离。

Peeling off the material, Asuka made no notion that it was in a way uncomfortable, even with his repeated questions about how she was.  
阿斯克剥下那层材料，丝毫没有表现出它带来的不适，尽管他一再询问她的感受。

Cutting across her waist, he pulled off the torso and left arm's material.  
他沿着她的腰部剪开，剥离了躯干和左臂的材料。

He felt sick. 他感到一阵恶心。

There on her torso, patches of scabbed skin presented themselves to him.  
就在她的躯干上，几块结痂的皮肤呈现在他眼前。

Shinji just stared at her lower torso, his eyes falling off her and down to the ground. Here he was with a sight his classmates could only dream of and all that he could feel now was the shame of his actions.  
真嗣只是盯着她的下腹部，目光从她身上移开，落到了地面上。此刻他眼前所见，是同学们梦寐以求的景象，而他此刻能感受到的，只有自己行为的羞愧。

He could feel the tears coming, but he forced them down, right now she didn't need him weeping at the sight of her, no, she needed him to be strong.  
他感觉到泪水即将涌出，但他强忍着，此刻她不需要他因见到她而哭泣，不，她需要他坚强。

He could do that for now.  
他暂时可以这么做。

He could do that for her.  
他可以为她这么做。

So, he went back to peeling off her plug suit, taking off the lower half she just glared at him while he averted his eyes.  
于是，他继续剥下她的插头服，脱掉下半部分，她一边瞪着他，他一边避开目光。

"Oh, you're embarrassed?" she spat at him.  
"哦，你害羞了？" 她朝他啐道。

"C'mon," he said, moving around her to draw a bath, "let's see if there's still water."  
"来吧，" 他说着绕过她去放洗澡水，"看看还有没有水。"

Luckily, there was, and it wasn't too cold either, the apartment complex probably had a small water supply. He wondered how long it would be till either of them bathed again, he guessed that depended on how fast people returned.  
幸运的是，水龙头里还有水，而且也不算太冷，公寓楼可能有个小型的供水系统。他琢磨着他们俩何时才能再次洗澡，估计这取决于人们回来的速度有多快。

Helping the girl up, Shinji set her slowly into the bath, doing his best to not react to the scabs on her back and not linger on sights that other boys would kill for.  
帮助女孩起身，真嗣小心翼翼地将她放入浴缸，尽力不去注意她背上的结痂，也不去留恋那些其他男孩梦寐以求的景象。

"Can I see your right arm?" he asked, wanting to unwrap it and see how bad it was.  
“我能看看你的右臂吗？”他问道，想要解开绷带，看看伤势有多严重。

She just let him hold it as he unwrapped the gauze, revealing the scab that ran from between her middle and index fingers.  
她只是任由他握着，随着绷带的解开，露出了从中指和食指间延伸至手腕的结痂。

Asuka just looked at the hand as he let it go, beginning to unwrap the bandages on her head, all the while a single thought occupied his mind.  
明日香只是看着他的手放开，开始解开她头上的绷带，与此同时，他的脑海中只有一个念头萦绕不去。

You let this happen. 是你让这一切发生的。

You let this happen. 是你让这一切发生的。

You did this. 是你干的。

It took everything to suppress those feelings, he'd deal with them later.  
他竭尽全力压抑这些情感，打算稍后再处理它们。

Pulling off the gauze, he was met with a scab above her lift eye and a lifeless white eye underneath.  
他揭开纱布，只见她左眼上方结了痂，而下方则是一只毫无生气的白色眼球。

"Guess it's not coming back." She mumbled, now knowing she had no use of her left eye.  
“看来是不会回来了。”她喃喃自语，此刻才意识到自己的左眼已无用武之地。

He frowned as he removed her A10 clips, then grabbed a washcloth and began to wet her hair and shoulders.  
他皱着眉头取下她的 A10 夹子，随后拿起一块湿布，开始湿润她的头发和肩膀。

She said nothing as he worked out dried chips of LCL through her fiery hair, doing his best not to tug before working his way down.  
她一言不发，任由他在她炽热的头发中清理干结的 LCL 碎片，竭力避免拉扯，小心翼翼地向下进行。

The water was just below chest level, though the girl had her good arm over her chest, not that he was staring. Gingerly he worked on her back and gently scrubbed the LCL from her hurt arm.  
水面刚好没过胸口，尽管女孩用她那只完好的手臂护在胸前，不过他并没有盯着看。他小心翼翼地在她背上擦拭，轻柔地清洗着她受伤手臂上的 LCL。

"Do you want to do the rest?" he asked, knowing she probably didn't want him touching her beyond what he had already done.  
“剩下的你自己来可以吗？”他问道，心里明白她可能不希望他再触碰她，除了已经做过的事情。

She said nothing and just nodded. Standing up, Shinji handed her a clean washcloth, "When you're done or if you need anything, just call for me, alright?"  
她没有说话，只是点了点头。真嗣站起身，递给她一块干净的毛巾，“洗完了或者需要什么，就叫我一声，好吗？”

Again, a slight nod but without any eye contact.  
又一次，他微微点头，却没有目光接触。

Taking his leave, Shinji closed the door on the way out. Looking around he found himself gravitating to the bedroom and letting himself rest against the wall. Slowly he slid to the floor, sitting with his knees up to his chest.  
告辞后，真嗣出门时关上了门。环顾四周，他发现自己不自觉地走向卧室，靠在墙上休息。他缓缓滑坐到地板上，双膝抱在胸前。

There was no way for him to know about the silent tears being shed behind the bathroom door.  
他无从知晓浴室门后正默默流淌的泪水。

And was no way for her to know how many droplets rained onto the bedroom floor.  
她无从知晓有多少泪珠滴落在卧室地板上。

The tears had finally come.  
泪水终于涌了出来。

**I think it's important to remember that something stated from a character's POV isn't necessarily the truth. This chapter really pounds Shinji into the ground, more than I believe it needs to, but it's his own thoughts about himself, so it fits.  
我认为记住一点很重要：角色视角所陈述的内容未必是真相。这篇chapter确实把真嗣打击得体无完肤，比我预想的还要严重，但这是他对自己的看法，所以也合情合理。**

**This is the origin to, what I consider to be, the unhealthy obsession with Asuka, unhealthy in the way that he pursues it, clearly to his own detriment and with half of it due to self-loathing. Does that mean he doesn't actually love her? No. It means Shinji only learned half his lesson and he'll have to pay the school fees again.  
这是我对明日香不健康痴迷的源头，这种痴迷在他追求的过程中表现得尤为明显，显然对他自己是有害的，其中一半源于自我厌恶。这是否意味着他并不真正爱她？不。这意味着真嗣只学到了一半的教训，他将不得不再次支付学费。**

### Chapter 53: "…I wish that I could turn back time…"  
Chapter 53: "…我多么希望能回到过去…"

The boy shivered as he walked down the empty street. The only sounds he could hear being those of the squeaking cart behind him.  
男孩走在空无一人的街道上，颤抖着。他唯一能听到的声音就是身后吱吱作响的推车声。

He pulled his tattered jacket closer as the gust of wind whipped him like some cruel tormentor, threatening to tear away the patches that had been sewn into it. He had never really been cold before, he had heard the stories, how those before the Third Impact had the seasons change before their eyes, and rumors that some regions were stuck in everlasting winter.  
他紧紧裹住那件破烂不堪的夹克，狂风如残忍的折磨者般抽打在他身上，仿佛要将缝在上面的补丁撕裂。他从未真正感到过寒冷，尽管听说过第三次冲击前的人们如何经历季节的变迁，以及某些地区陷入永恒冬天的传闻。

Shinji could faintly remember how he had wanted to experience winter, if only once. Before he came to Tokyo-03 he truly hadn't wished for much, but that had been one thing he wanted, a reprieve from the everlasting summer and the heat that came with it.  
真嗣隐约记得自己曾渴望体验一次冬天，哪怕只有一次。在来到东京-03 之前，他并没有太多奢望，但那确实是他的心愿之一，希望能从无尽的夏日和随之而来的酷热中得到片刻喘息。

That felt like such a long time ago, it felt like it was someone else's memories, but he knew they were his own.  
那感觉仿佛是很久以前的事了，像是别人的记忆，但他清楚那是自己的。

As Shinji walked down the deserted streets, he kept an eye out for anything that had changed. Had a door been left open? A pile window broken into? Maybe a car door left ajar? Nothing. The small town barely changed since they got here, no change, no people, nothing.  
当真嗣走在空无一人的街道上时，他时刻留意着是否有任何变化。门是否敞开着？窗户是否被打破？或许有辆车的门半开着？什么都没有。自他们来到这里以来，这座小镇几乎没有变化，没有变化，没有人，什么都没有。

This was his daily routine, he went out, looking for supplies, dragging them back to Asuka. Each day he went about combing over another section of the town, scavenging for non-perishables, medicine, anything they might need.  
这是他的日常惯例，他外出寻找补给，拖回给明日香。每天他都在小镇的另一部分仔细搜寻，寻找不易腐烂的食物、药品，任何他们可能需要的东西。

Another gust of wind slammed into him, nearly stopping him in his tracks, but he pushed on to his destination.  
又一阵风猛烈地吹向他，几乎让他停下脚步，但他还是继续向目的地前进。

The sound of waves splashing against sand told him he was close and as he rounded the next corner the red sea filled his view, as well as his project. Well, their project really, it was Asuka who had convinced him this was their best option.  
海浪拍击沙滩的声音告诉他，他已近在咫尺。当他绕过下一个转角，红海便填满了他的视野，还有他的项目。好吧，其实是他们的项目，是明日香说服了他这是最佳选择。

A boat was moored to the side of the docks, it was a rusty thing, probably some wealthy businessman's get away from Tokyo-02. It was large enough to have a comfortable cabin inside, enough for plenty of provisions, and more importantly a place for her to rest. On the side of the vessel, its name mocked him as he brought his cart to a stop.  
一艘船停泊在码头边，锈迹斑斑，大概是某个富商逃离东京-02 的避难所。它足够大，内部有一间舒适的船舱，足以储备大量物资，更重要的是，有一个让她休息的地方。船舷上，那名字在他停下推车时嘲弄着他。

_Second Chances 第二次机会_

Shinji grabbed one of the bins off his cart and walked onto the yacht, opening its door and ducking into the interior. Asuka had dictated no less than twelve bins would do for them, just in case and he trusted her judgment.  
真嗣从手推车上抓起一个箱子，走上游艇，打开门，弯腰进入内部。明日香曾指示至少需要十二个箱子才能满足他们的需求，以防万一，他相信她的判断。

Just as he stacked it alongside the other eight bins, he hissed and dropped the bin onto the floor, spilling out the cans and jugs. His palms burned, flashing over and over Shinji bit his lip to keep himself from crying out, he knew this would pass, it always passed. However, time seemed to slow to a crawl and he was left breathing heavily as his palms returned to normal while his skin was chilled by the cold air through sweat.  
正当他将箱子堆放在其他八个箱子旁边时，他倒吸一口凉气，将箱子掉落在地，罐子和瓶子散落一地。他的手掌灼热难耐，疼痛感反复袭来，真嗣咬紧嘴唇，强忍着不让自己叫出声来，他知道这会过去的，总是会过去的。然而，时间似乎变得异常缓慢，他喘着粗气，手掌终于恢复正常，而汗水却让他的皮肤在冷空气中感到冰凉。

Cleaning up the mess, Shinji nodded to himself and headed back out, there wasn't much he could do about those episodes, pressure helped but it only did so much. Back on his cart, he brought over a fuel can leaving his arms shaking as he made the few steps to his destination.  
清理完混乱的现场，真嗣对自己点点头，然后走了出去，对于这些突发状况，他能做的并不多，压力或许有所帮助，但效果有限。回到手推车上，他拿起一个油罐，颤抖着迈出几步，走向目的地。

Shinji opened it and poured, watching as the gauge ticked just over 3/4ths before taking the can back with him to the dock. Another blast of icy wind struck him and prompted a cacophony of noise from all the boats thrashing at their moorings. He needed to work faster, if they didn't leave before ice began to form, it would all be for nothing.  
真嗣打开罐子倒出液体，看着刻度线刚过四分之三便将罐子带回了码头。又一阵寒风袭来，激起了所有系泊船只的喧嚣。他需要加快速度，如果冰开始形成之前他们还没离开，一切努力都将白费。

Asuka had been the one to point out they should leave, even if he didn't voice his own concerns. What if they came back? They would be gone without a trace, and all their friends would be waiting for them to return too.  
是明日香指出他们应该离开的，尽管他没有说出自己的担忧。如果他们回来怎么办？他们将消失得无影无踪，而所有朋友还在等着他们归来。

Taking his now much lighter cart back up the dock he made his way to the apartment complex they had yet to move from. He stopped in front of the door to check the generator outside, reading half a tank, he nodded to himself before making his way to the stairs.  
推着轻了许多的手推车回到码头，他走向他们尚未搬离的公寓楼。在门前停下检查外面的发电机，看到油箱还有一半，他自顾自地点了点头，然后走向楼梯。

He was used to the climb now, only three stories, yet it was one of the tallest buildings in the town, perfect for what they needed. As he crested the top, he felt a sense of hope to see someone sitting there, but it was quickly stamped out as he made his way to the edge closest to the shore. A chair and small box rested against the air conditioning unit, shielded by the winds, and inside, a pair of binoculars that had been scavenged from the flotilla of boats on the docks.  
他对攀爬已经习以为常，虽然只有三层楼高，但这已是镇上最高的建筑之一，对他们所需而言再完美不过。当他登上顶楼时，看到有人坐在那里，心中涌起一丝希望，但很快就被他走向离海岸最近的边缘时熄灭了。一把椅子和一个小箱子靠在空调机组旁，避开了风，箱子里是一对从码头船只残骸中搜寻来的双筒望远镜。

Shinji brought them up to his eyes and searched, north, then south. An evening ritual, searching for any signs that someone, anyone had returned. Sometimes if she was feeling up to it, Asuka would spend her day up here, braving the climb and acting as a sentry scanning the shoreline for anyone as she combed over maps, but those days were not as numerous as he would have liked.  
真嗣将望远镜举到眼前，先向北，再向南搜索。这是他每晚的例行公事，寻找是否有任何人回来的迹象。有时，如果明日香状态不错，她会在这里度过一天，勇敢地攀爬并充当哨兵，扫视海岸线，同时仔细研究地图，但这样的日子并不如他所愿那样频繁。

"Where are they?" “他们在哪儿？”

The words had left his lips with little vigor, and after standing there for a few more minutes with no sign of life, Shinji placed the binoculars back in the box. Another day gone and without a hint of anyone else returning, that made roughly three months.  
话语从他唇间流出，显得有气无力，又在那儿站了几分钟，不见丝毫生机，真嗣便将望远镜放回盒中。又一天过去了，依旧没有任何人归来的迹象，这已大约是第三个月了。

He hurried down to the apartment as the last bit of light fell beyond the horizon and grabbed the last few things from his cart as he went inside.  
他匆匆赶下楼，就在最后一抹阳光消失在地平线之际，抓起手推车里的最后几样东西，走进了公寓。

"You're late." "你迟到了。"

The voice came from the bedroom just as the door shut, but he just calmly placed his things on the counter. "I'm not late, the day's just getting shorter."  
声音从卧室传来，正好门关上了，但他只是平静地把东西放在柜台上。"我没迟到，只是白天变短了。"

Taking off his coat, he saw the mop of red hair emerge from the bedroom. She was walking today, so that made it a good day, but the pale skin told him why she hadn't been up on the roof.  
他脱下外套，看到一团红发从卧室里冒出来。她今天能走路了，所以这是个好日子，但她苍白的皮肤告诉他为什么她没上屋顶。

"Did you fill another bin?" she asked, changing the topic.  
"你又装满了一个垃圾桶吗？" 她问道，改变了话题。

"Yeah," he nodded, "two more to go."  
"是的，" 他点头，"还有两个要装。"

"I've been thinking," she started, "Just get one more, it'd do us no good waiting and getting trapped by ice."  
"我在想，" 她开口道，"再装一个就行了，等待只会让我们被冰困住，毫无益处。"

Shinji didn't comment on the plan, he simply nodded.  
真嗣没有对计划发表评论，只是点了点头。

Asuka gingerly made her way to the table, while steadying herself against the counter. She picked up and eyed the food he had brought back, tilting her head so she could make out just what it was with her good eye.  
明日香小心翼翼地走向桌子，同时扶着柜台保持平衡。她拿起他带回来的食物，用她那只好眼睛仔细打量，歪着头想辨认出那是什么。

"Salted fried chicken with roasted green onions…" she muttered, causing Shinji to smile.  
“盐酥鸡配烤葱……”她喃喃自语，让真嗣露出了微笑。

"Your kanji's gotten better."  
"你的汉字进步了不少。"

"Well, I can't do much but read in here can I?" she snapped back.  
"哼，我在这里除了看书还能做什么呢？" 她不耐烦地回道。"

Shinji didn't slink away, partly because he knew she didn't have the strength to swipe at him, and because frankly he had gotten used to her attitude. After all, more than anyone she had an excuse to always be in a foul mood.  
真嗣没有退缩，部分原因是他知道她没有力气打他，而且坦白说，他已经习惯了她的态度。毕竟，她比任何人都更有理由总是心情不好。

"It's good stuff, I found someone's earthquake stock, so it should be really nice," Shinji explained.  
"这是好东西，我找到了某人的地震储备，应该会很不错，" 真嗣解释道。

In all honestly, the proclivity of earthquakes in Japan had helped them, this is the second time he'd found someone's emergency supply, and while it helped they were running out of time and both of them knew it.  
说实话，日本频繁的地震倒是帮了他们一把，这已经是他第二次找到别人的应急物资了，尽管这有所帮助，但他们的时间所剩无几，两人都心知肚明。

"Did you figure out where you want to go?" he asked, as he took the packet from her.  
"你想好要去哪儿了吗？" 他问道，同时从她手中接过包裹。

"It depends," she said, slowly lowering herself into a seat at the table while Shinji started on the food, "I haven't decided where we should land in Kyushu, but if it's cold there too we should keep heading south."  
"看情况吧，" 她一边说，一边缓缓坐到桌边的椅子上，而真嗣已经开始吃东西了，"我还没决定在九州哪里登陆，但如果那里也很冷的话，我们应该继续往南走。"

Shinji raised an eyebrow to himself but continued working on their food.  
真嗣自己挑了挑眉，但继续埋头吃他们的食物。

"I haven't worked out the details," she admitted, "but we should definitely keep from being out in the open sea for long."  
"具体的我还没想好，" 她承认道，"但我们绝对不能在公海上待太久。"

"It's getting colder." He said simply.  
"天气越来越冷了。" 他简单地说道。

"I noticed," he pulled her sweater tighter "I haven't been running the generator that much."  
"我注意到了，" 他将她的毛衣拉得更紧，"我没怎么开发电机。"

"I'll make sure to bring back more fuel tomorrow." He said, bringing the food back to the table.  
"我明天会确保带回更多燃料。" 他说着，将食物带回桌子上。

"No. Keep it for the boat." She said, taking the bowl and fork from him.  
"不，留着船上用。" 她接过碗和叉子，对他说道。

He sat down across from her and started eating his own. It was a dish more flavorful than usual, and he relished the flavors popping in his mouth.  
他在她对面坐下，开始享用自己的那份。这道菜比平时更有味道，他享受着口中迸发的风味。

"This is so much better than Misato's 'cooking'." He said, a grin growing.  
"这可比美里'做的饭'好吃多了。" 他笑着说，脸上露出得意的笑容。

"Misato could cook?" "美里会做饭？"

He looked up from his meal to see the girl's confused face and couldn't help but give a weak snort.  
他抬头看向女孩困惑的脸庞，忍不住轻声笑了一下。

"Misato could 'cook'," he said, making air quotes with his chopsticks, "the first night I spent at her apartment all she cooked was instant ramen and tv dinners."  
"美里'会做饭'，"他说着，用筷子比划着引号，"我第一次在她公寓过夜时，她做的全是方便面和电视快餐。"

"How am I not surprised?" Asuka asked, taking another bite.  
"我怎么会感到意外呢？" 明日香问道，又咬了一口食物。

"It gets worse, we had Ritsuko over, and she bought microwave curry." He explained, finishing his food.  
"更糟糕的是，律子也来了，她还带了微波炉咖喱。" 他解释道，吃完了自己的食物。

"Gross." "真恶心。"

"I know, but she made instant ramen and wanted the curry dumped in it." He said, his smile growing, "but somehow she ruined every other dish for us!"  
"我知道，但她煮了方便面，还想把咖喱倒进去。" 他说着，笑容逐渐扩大，"但不知怎么的，她把我们其他的菜都毁了！"

Asuka just stared at him, while the memory surfaced. Just after the Fourth Angel, three of them sitting around a table that had tv dinner food strewn about. The thought of Ritsuko's face after the first bite only served to further fuel the smile, while Asuka seemed unable to process what he just told her.  
明日香只是盯着他，记忆浮现。就在第四使徒之后，他们三人围坐在一张桌子旁，桌上散落着电视晚餐的食物。想到律子吃第一口后的表情，笑容更加灿烂，而明日香似乎无法理解他刚刚告诉她的事情。

She shook her head, "You know what? That's exactly what I'd expect from her."  
她摇了摇头，"你知道吗？那正是我对她的期待。"

Shinji didn't notice it, probably due to the laughter that was now bubbling up inside him, but Asuka's lips had begun to curl and soon the kitchen was filled with their laughter. Both of them laughed at the image, their former guardian failing miserably at such a simple task.  
真嗣并未察觉，或许是因为内心涌动的笑意，但明日香的嘴角已开始上扬，很快厨房里便充满了他们的笑声。两人对着那幅画面大笑，他们曾经的监护人在如此简单的任务上竟如此狼狈。

"No wonder you started cooking," Asuka said, the laughter between them dying down.  
"难怪你开始做饭了。"明日香说道，两人间的笑声渐渐平息。

"You should have seen the look on our faces, even Pen Pen couldn't eat it." And just like that, another round of laughter started up again. Somehow not even the howling of the wind outside could stop either of them, it was infectious, all thoughts of their current world forgotten, swept aside by such a simple memory.  
"你真该看看我们当时的表情，就连 Pen Pen 都吃不下去了。" 就这样，又一阵笑声爆发了。不知怎的，连外面的风声呼啸也无法阻止他们，这笑声极具感染力，所有关于当前世界的思绪都被这样一个简单的回忆所取代，抛诸脑后。

Before it, all came crashing back down.  
在这之前，一切又都轰然崩溃。

Shinji noticed immediately, it was only his laughter, and as soon as he looked up he knew why. Asuka's face had turned even paler, and the redhead soon keeled over, clutching her torso.  
真嗣立刻注意到了，只有他在笑，而当他抬头时，他立刻明白了原因。明日香的脸色变得更加苍白，红发少女很快弯下腰，紧抓着自己的腹部。

"Asuka?!" he shot up, rounding the table before a hand shot up.  
“明日香？！”他猛地站起身，绕过桌子，却见一只手突然举起。

"It'll pass." She said simply,  
“会过去的。”她简单地说道，

He knew there was nothing he could do, no matter how many times this happened he knew the right thing to do was wait for it to pass, but that didn't mean he felt any better. For an agonizing minute, she just sat there shaking, bent over, arms wrapped around herself, and Shinji knew for a fact he heard more than one whimper, but he knew better than to comment on it.  
他知道无计可施，无论这种事发生多少次，他都明白正确的做法是等待它过去，但这并不意味着他会感觉好些。在令人煎熬的一分钟里，她只是坐在那里颤抖，弯着腰，双臂紧紧抱住自己，而真嗣确信自己听到了不止一声的呜咽，但他知道最好不要对此发表评论。

Instead, he waited, with her, and as the minutes ticked by eventually he heard a deep intake of breath before she righted herself and stood up, legs shaking. He waited for her to say something, anything, but she just nodded, before slowly walking back to her room.  
相反，他陪着她等待，随着时间一分一秒地流逝，终于听到她深吸一口气，然后挺直身子站了起来，双腿颤抖。他等着她开口说些什么，什么都好，但她只是点了点头，然后缓缓走回自己的房间。

He couldn't do anything for her, and sometimes that hurt worse than his palms.  
他无法为她做任何事，有时这比他手掌的疼痛更让他难受。

It wasn't unlike him to wake up in the middle of the night. It wasn't unusual for him to go get a drink of water either, in fact on more than one occasion he had company, though there were never any words.  
半夜醒来对他来说并不罕见。去喝口水也是常有的事，事实上，不止一次他还有伴，尽管从未有过言语交流。

Tonight he had no company and he figured why should he? Why would she want to talk to the person who was responsible for her pain? Shinji finished his water and started back to his bed, the couch. It was only fair, she should be as comfortable as possible.  
今晚他独自一人，心想何必呢？她怎会愿意与那个给她带来痛苦的人交谈？真嗣喝完水，起身返回他的床铺——那张沙发。这样才公平，她理应尽可能舒适些。

As he passed her door he slowed, just on the chance she might open the door at any moment, maybe having taken her time to get out of bed, but instead of footsteps, it was muffled voices that he heard.  
当他经过她的房门时，他放慢了脚步，只是以防她随时可能开门，或许她正慢慢从床上起身，然而传来的并非脚步声，而是低沉的说话声。

Listened again, unable to make out just what was being said, but at the first quiet cry, his hand reached for the door handle before freezing.  
再次倾听，却无法分辨出具体的话语，但听到第一声低低的哭泣时，他的手伸向门把手，却在最后一刻僵住了。

What would she do to him for barging in unannounced? What really could she do to him now? Regardless he was petrified, unable to open the door, but unwilling to retreat to his bed.  
她会因为他不请自来而对他做什么？现在她又能对他做什么呢？尽管如此，他还是吓得动弹不得，无法打开门，也不愿退回自己的床铺。

You promised. 你答应过的。

The thought propelled him, his muscles worked on their own, despite how terrified he was and slowly he pushed the door, cracking it to look into the room. Again he heard her whimper, causing only another stab in his gut.  
这个念头推动着他，尽管内心极度恐惧，他的肌肉却自行运作，慢慢地他推开门，裂开一道缝隙窥视房间。再次听到她的呜咽声，只让他的腹部又是一阵刺痛。

"Shinji?" “真嗣？”

His name took him by surprise. She had never called out his name before, but the figure laying on the bed hadn't truly acknowledged him, he was sure of that as he got closer. Her eyes were closed even as she twitched in her sleep.  
她的呼唤让他吃了一惊。她从未叫过他的名字，但躺在床上的人显然并未真正注意到他，他走近时确信了这一点。她的眼睛紧闭，即使在睡梦中身体微微抽搐。

Neither of them was immune to nightmares, typically the noises from the opposite room would go unacknowledged by each of them. That didn't stop either from getting up to get a glass of water in the middle of the night however, rarely they spoke, and if anything was said it was to assure that they had only gotten up for a drink.  
他们俩都无法免疫噩梦，通常隔壁房间的声响不会引起彼此的注意。但这并不妨碍他们在深夜起床去倒杯水，很少交谈，如果有什么话要说，也只是为了确认对方只是起来喝水的。

Maybe he would never know exactly why he had decided to come into her room this time, but upon reaching the edge of the bed, Shinji knelt down, doing his best to get a better look at her sleeping face.  
或许他永远无法确切知晓这次为何决定走进她的房间，但当抵达床边时，真嗣跪了下来，竭尽全力想要更仔细地端详她沉睡的面容。

"Where… Where are you?" “你……你在哪儿？”

What was she… 她在做什么……

Asuka convulsed again, gripping the sheets around her figure, lashing out at her dreams, but he didn't back away. He promised he wouldn't run away.  
明日香再次抽搐，紧抓着身边的床单，挣扎于梦境之中，但他没有退缩。他承诺过不会逃跑。

"guess… you can never count… on idiot Shinji!" she mumbled.  
"猜…你永远不能…指望白痴真嗣！"她咕哝着。

"Asuka." He whispered, trying to wake her up, he had seen enough of this, his gut was twisting at the sight of the girl's face contorted in pain.  
"明日香。"他低声呼唤，试图唤醒她，他已经看够了这一切，看到女孩痛苦扭曲的脸庞，他的内心纠结不已。

She yelled again, as he placed his hand on her shoulder, launching up and grabbing onto him. Her eye shot open, though he was certain she couldn't tell if the sight was reality or not, she looked more like a predator about to pounce than a girl.  
她再次尖叫起来，当他把手放在她的肩膀上时，她猛地起身抓住了他。她的眼睛突然睁开，尽管他确信她无法分辨这是现实还是幻觉，她的样子更像是一头即将扑食的猛兽，而非一个女孩。

"You. Where were you? I needed you."  
"你。你刚才在哪儿？我需要你。"

Shinji gingerly brought his hands up to latch onto her arms, with that contact the girl seemed to be brought back to the real world and all the tenseness in her body faded away. If she understood what she had just said her face didn't betray it.  
真嗣小心翼翼地抬起手，抓住她的手臂，这一接触似乎将女孩拉回了现实世界，她全身的紧张感也随之消散。如果她意识到自己刚才说了什么，她的脸上并没有表现出来。

"You were screaming." He explained it was all he could manage.  
"你刚才在尖叫。" 他解释道，这是他唯一能说出口的话。

There was no response other than a hiss of pain, and when she released from him, her hands went straight for her torso. The girl lowered herself back into bed, rolling to face away from him, and he took that as the only signal he needed to leave.  
除了痛苦的嘶声，没有其他回应，她从他身边挣脱后，双手立刻伸向自己的腹部。女孩缓缓躺回床上，翻身背对他，他便将此视为离开的唯一信号。

At the door he stopped and turned, looking down over her still-quaking form. He could leave right then and there, there was no reason not to, she didn't want him there, she hated him.  
在门口他停下脚步，转身回望她仍在颤抖的身影。他完全可以就此离去，没有理由留下，她不希望他在那里，她恨他。

But he didn't want that.  
但他并不想那样。

He closed the door, but his footsteps stayed inside the bedroom. He picked up an extra blanket from the foot of the bed and climbed in next to her.  
他关上门，脚步却留在了卧室里。他从床尾拿起一条额外的毯子，爬进被窝，躺在了她旁边。

Asuka's figure stiffened as soon as he sat down, and he wasn't sure if she would tolerate this if she felt better. Deciding actually being up against her would be too far, he laid down on top of the covers, keeping them as a layer between them, and used the spare blanket as his own.  
他一坐下，明日香的身躯就僵硬起来，他不确定如果她感觉好些了，是否还能容忍这种情况。决定直接靠近她可能太过分了，他便躺在被子上，让被子成为他们之间的一层隔阂，用那条备用毯子作为自己的覆盖。

With his back against the headboard, he tried to close his eyes and forget about the possibly cataclysmic mistake he had just made. For a while he did, he dozed in and out, almost forgetting about where he was, at least until there was movement.  
他背靠着床头板，试图闭上眼睛，忘却自己刚刚可能犯下的灾难性错误。有那么一会儿，他确实做到了，时睡时醒，几乎忘记了身处何地，直到有动静出现。

He just barely opened his eyes to see his companion no longer turned with her back to him, instead, she was at the base of the bed grabbing another blanket. He thought perhaps it was her going to the living room, unable to sleep in the same bed as him, but she turned right back around.  
他刚刚勉强睁开眼，就发现他的同伴不再背对着他，而是站在床尾，抓起另一条毯子。他原以为她是要去客厅，无法与他同床共枕，但她却立刻转了回来。

Shinji dared do nothing as she spread the blanket and crawled back into her side, but above the covers now, and close to him.  
真嗣不敢有任何动作，看着她铺开毯子，又爬回自己的一侧，但这次是在被子上方，并且紧贴着他。

The mop of red hair was pressed up against him, pushing herself into him with great force. Soon even her arms were wrapping slowly around him, letting her use him almost as an oversized pillow.  
那一头红发紧贴着他，她用力将自己挤进他怀里。很快，她的手臂也慢慢环绕过来，几乎把他当作一个巨大的枕头。

Why though? Was she cold? No that was stupid, they had plenty of covers and he was fine, no he knew exactly why she was doing this. The pressure helped with the pains, it was that simple.  
但为什么呢？她冷吗？不，这很愚蠢，他们有足够的被子，而他感觉良好，不，他清楚她这么做的原因。压力有助于缓解疼痛，就这么简单。

Did it matter she was warm? No. Did it matter a beautiful girl was practically hugging him? No. What mattered at that moment was how he was helping her, there was nothing else. even if this was her simply using him he didn't care, he put himself there.  
她温暖与否重要吗？不重要。一个美丽的女孩几乎在拥抱他，这重要吗？不重要。那一刻，重要的是他在帮助她，别无其他。即使这只是她在利用他，他也不在乎，是他自己选择这样做的。

Gingerly he let his arm fall down over her back, and despite the initial flinch, she eventually relaxed and the rhythmic rising and falling of her figure forced all his panic to melt away. He forgot all about the fragility of the moment, instead, they both found themselves falling into the first peaceful night of sleep since their return.  
他小心翼翼地将手臂搭在她的背上，尽管起初她有些畏缩，但最终她放松下来，她身体的起伏节奏迫使他所有的恐慌都消散了。他忘记了那一刻的脆弱，取而代之的是，他们俩都沉浸在归来后的第一个宁静夜晚的睡眠中。

ʡ.ʢ

There had been no shouting the next morning, no death glares, no-balled fists or verbal stabs. All there had been when he opened his eyes was a singular blue orb staring up at him.  
第二天早上没有争吵，没有死亡凝视，没有紧握的拳头或言语攻击。当他睁开眼睛时，只有一只蓝色的眼睛凝视着他。

No words were exchanged, not when he pulled away, not when she watched him gather his blankets, and not when he looked back from the open door.  
没有言语交流，无论是他抽身离去时，还是她目送他收拾毯子，亦或是他站在敞开的门口回望之际。

Asuka Langley Soryu had said nothing about what he did.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷对此事只字未提。

And yet… 然而……

She had told him everything.  
她已经把一切都告诉了他。

Because she hadn't tried to push him away, because he had helped her, because she had _let_ him help her.  
因为她没有试图推开他，因为他帮助了她，因为她允许他帮助她。

So he dressed with extra energy, prepared breakfast with vigor, and when she appeared from the bedroom he served her the best breakfast they had supplies for. As they ate, it didn't bother him that she said nothing, in fact, it was better that way.  
于是他充满活力地穿好衣服，精神抖擞地准备早餐，当她从卧室出来时，他为她端上了他们储备中最丰盛的早餐。他们用餐时，她一言不发，但这并没有让他感到困扰，事实上，这样更好。

After finishing, he excused himself and put away his dishes, before getting ready for the day. She had gone back to her room and reappeared at the table by the time he was ready, instead of food, a map lay in front of her, he was sure she would spend the majority of the day working on plans for them.  
完事后，他告辞并收拾好自己的餐具，准备开始新的一天。她回到房间，等他准备好时，她已经重新出现在桌前，桌上摆的不是食物，而是一张地图。他确信她会花大部分时间为他们制定计划。

"Alright, I'm going." He said, donning his jacket in silence.  
“好了，我走了。”他默默地穿上外套说道。

Only when his hand landed on the door did she speak up.  
直到他的手触到门把手，她才开口。

"Shinji?" “真嗣？”

He turned, but she wasn't looking at him, instead, her back was turned as she peered over the maps.  
他转过身，但她并未看向他，而是背对着他，正凝视着地图。

"When you come back, I want… I want to talk."  
“当你回来时，我想要……我想要谈谈。”

His voice caught in his throat. What was he supposed to say? Suddenly he wanted to go back to how they had been, but that was shattered now. Shinji's mind raced but ultimately he blurted out the only thing that sounded right.  
他的声音哽在喉咙里。他该说什么呢？突然间，他渴望回到他们曾经的状态，但那已成碎片。真嗣的思绪飞速运转，但最终他脱口而出唯一听起来正确的话。

"Ok, when I come back."  
“好的，我回来时再说。”

ʡ.ʢ

Everything had gone wrong today.  
今天一切都出了差错。

Despite everything that had transpired that morning, he found barely any supplies, every building being a complete write-off. His cart seemed to get stuck at every opportunity and he had twisted his ankle, causing him to wince at every step.  
尽管那天早上发生了那么多事，他几乎没找到什么补给，每栋建筑都彻底报废了。他的推车似乎总在找机会卡住，他还扭伤了脚踝，每走一步都疼得皱眉。

The only thing he had going for him was the motivation.  
他唯一拥有的就是那份动力。

"_I want to talk."_ “我想谈谈。”

It was probably the reason for his misfortune, he had been thinking about that all day. He should have been thinking about that for the past few months, in fact, he was thinking about what he should say to her. Now though? It all just sounded wrong to him, what was there to talk about?  
这或许是他不幸的根源，他一整天都在思考这个问题。实际上，他应该在过去几个月里就考虑过，他一直在想应该对她说些什么。但现在呢？一切都听起来不对劲，还有什么可谈的呢？

What wasn't there to talk about?  
还有什么不可谈的呢？

He shook his head as he made his way back home, he could skip the marina today, there was no point, the fuel would go to the generator and he had barely anything for a new bin. They were so close and now his luck had dried up.  
他摇摇头，往家走去，今天可以不去码头了，没有意义，燃料会供给发电机，而他几乎没有新的垃圾桶可用。他们曾经那么接近，现在他的运气却枯竭了。

Spotting the apartment building in the distance, his pace quickened, and his breathing picked up. Pulling up to the door, Shinji stood there. Again, he wanted to go in, he wanted to talk, but part of him screamed not to.  
远远望见那栋公寓楼，他的步伐加快了，呼吸也急促起来。走到门口，真嗣停了下来。又一次，他想进去，想交谈，但内心的一部分却在尖叫着阻止他。

How was this going to end up any different from when they first came back?  
这和当初他们刚回来时有什么不同呢？

He didn't want to think that way anymore, but the thought was still there, like a vine regrowing on a tree. Ultimately his feet did move though, just not into the apartment. In his nervousness to go inside, he forgot that she might not even be there and if she wasn't on the roof… well it was a way to postpone facing her.  
他不想再这样想了，但这个念头依旧像树上的藤蔓一样重新生长。最终，他的脚确实动了，只是没有走进公寓。由于紧张而犹豫是否要进去，他忘记了她可能根本不在那里，如果她不在屋顶上……好吧，这至少是一种推迟面对她的方式。

He winced as he climbed to the roof, before limping slightly to the edge. As always, he took the binoculars and peered out over the coastline. North, South, it was the same as it had been for months, barren.  
他爬上屋顶时皱了皱眉，随后略显跛行地走向边缘。一如既往，他拿起望远镜，眺望着海岸线。无论南北，数月来都是一片荒芜。

Shinji pulled his coat tighter as he watched the setting sun, its vibrant collars colliding with the sea. The ocean was still red, a stark contrast to the blue sky. No matter how many times he stared at it, he could never see it as normal. He doubted that it would ever be normal to him.  
真嗣紧了紧外套，凝视着夕阳西下，其绚烂的余晖与大海交融。海水依旧泛红，与蔚蓝的天空形成鲜明对比。无论他凝视多少次，都无法视之为寻常。他怀疑自己永远也无法将其视为正常。

"Why aren't you happy?" “你为什么不开心？”

The voice made him jump, and he nearly lost his balance as he flailed his arms to regain it. Looking around he saw nothing. In his chest, his heart pounded, a voice meant there was someone else, a voice meant they weren't alone anymore.  
那声音让他吓了一跳，他几乎失去平衡，挥舞着双臂试图恢复。环顾四周，却什么也没看见。他的心脏在胸腔里狂跳，有声音意味着还有其他人，有声音意味着他们不再孤单。

Or maybe he was just finally going crazy.  
或许他只是终于疯了。

"Why aren't you happy?" “你为什么不高兴？”

This time it came from behind him, and he recognized it.  
这次声音来自他身后，他立刻认了出来。

Ever so slowly he turned, his eyes finally landing on the figure of someone who shouldn't be. _Something_ that shouldn't be.  
他极其缓慢地转身，目光最终落在那个本不该出现的人影上。那个本不该存在的东西上。

Rei Ayanami was there, floating in the air just beyond the ledge. The girl was just as he remembered seeing her on the beach months ago, floating over the crimson water. Though he had long since passed it off to some mental trick or hallucination, perhaps it hadn't been all along.  
绫波零就在那里，悬浮在悬崖之外的空中。她的样子和他几个月前在海滩上看到的如出一辙，漂浮在鲜红的水面上。尽管他早已将其归咎于某种心理错觉或幻觉，或许那并非全然如此。

"Rei?" he asked, reaching out slowly to the floating girl.  
"丽？" 他缓缓伸出手，向着漂浮的女孩问道。

Those red eyes locked onto his hand, causing him to freeze. "Perhaps, perhaps not. I am more than Rei Ayanami was, I am perpetual."  
那双红眸紧盯着他的手，让他僵在原地。"或许，或许不是。我已超越了绫波丽，我是永恒的存在。"

"Lilith," Shinji said, retracting his hand while being met with a slow nod.  
"莉莉丝，" 真嗣说着，收回手时得到了一个缓慢的点头。

"Perhaps." She answered, "Why aren't you happy?" she asked again.  
"或许吧。" 她回答，"你为何不开心？" 她又问。

"What?" “什么？”

"You chose this, you rejected the gift bestowed upon humanity. If this is your choice, then why are you not rejoicing?"  
"这是你自己的选择，你拒绝了赐予人类的礼物。既然如此，为何不欢欣鼓舞呢？"

That question struck something inside him. Faster than he cared to admit anger built up inside him, and he clenched his hands into fists at such a question.  
这个问题触动了他内心某处。愤怒在他心中迅速积聚，快得他不愿承认，他紧握双拳，对这样的问题感到愤慨。

"Oh, I don't know. Maybe it has to do with the fact we're the only ones here!" he shouted. "Where is everyone? They were supposed to come back too, right? So why are we here alone!?"  
"哦，我不知道。可能是因为我们俩是这里仅有的人吧！" 他大声喊道。"其他人呢？他们不是也该回来了吗？那为什么只有我们在这里！？"

Lilith said nothing, tilting her head at the boy. Perhaps she thought of him as some lesser being, like how a human might look at a bird or rodent. Or maybe it was something else.  
莉莉丝一言不发，只是歪着头看着那个男孩。或许在她看来，他就像人类看待鸟类或啮齿动物一样，觉得他低人一等。又或许，是其他的原因。

"You are angry." "你生气了。"

"Of course I'm angry!" Shinji shouted, "Why hasn't anyone else come back!?"  
“我当然生气了！”真嗣喊道，“为什么其他人还没回来！？”

"It is their choice, perhaps they will in time."  
"这是他们的选择，或许随着时间他们会改变主意。"

"Perhaps? That's not good enough! Asuka can barely live, winter's coming, and we're alone. What kind of life is that?"  
"或许？这还不够好！明日香几乎无法生存，冬天即将来临，而我们孤立无援。这样的生活算什么？"

"The life you chose, a life of suffering and pain." She commented.  
""你选择的生活，充满苦难与痛苦。"" 她评论道。

"Yeah." Shinji said suddenly deflating, "but this isn't what I wanted. It's not what I want for her." He looked back up "when will anyone come back? Will anyone come back?"  
“嗯。”真嗣突然泄气地说，“但这不是我想要的。这不是我想要给她的。”他抬头望去，“什么时候会有人回来？会有人回来吗？”

"I do not know…" she answered, "I must admit, I believed more Lilin would choose to return by now, what has kept them is a mystery."  
“我不知道……”她回答，“我必须承认，我原以为会有更多人类会选择现在回来，是什么让他们留下来仍是个谜。”

"It's hopeless, isn't it?" Shinji asked, "If it's just Asuka and me, is there anything we can do?"  
“这是无望的，对吧？”真嗣问道，“如果只有我和明日香，我们还能做些什么吗？”

She said nothing, and Shinji just shook his head. Why was he even talking to this thing? Hadn't everything they had gone through been enough to convince him of that?  
她一言不发，真嗣只是摇了摇头。他为何还要与这东西交谈？难道他们经历的一切还不足以让他明白这一点吗？

"There is something." She answered.  
“有件事。”她回答道。

Anticiptation suddenly fluttered within Shinji, he stepped forwards towards the ledge, "What?"  
期待感突然在真嗣心中涌动，他向前迈步走向边缘，“什么？”

"You can make a choice," she answered, "Something to amend all that has transpired. It will not be easy, it will be an arduous journey, filled with pain."  
"你可以做出选择，"她回答道，"去弥补已经发生的一切。这不会容易，这将是一段充满艰辛的旅程，充满痛苦。"

"I can do it." He quickly, perhaps too quickly, before going silent at the realization of what she was saying. "Asuka, what about Asuka?"  
"我能做到。"他迅速，或许太迅速地回答，随后在意识到她话中的含义时沉默了。"明日香，那明日香怎么办？"

"She cannot go with you."  
"她不能与你同行。"

"What?" “什么？”

"This journey is for you and you alone."  
"这段旅程只属于你，你一个人。"

"Then… I can't. I won't leave her, not again." He said finally, taking a step back "I made a promise." He stopped, there was more, "And I don't think I'd be able to do it without her."  
"那么…我不能。我不会再离开她，绝不会。" 他终于说道，后退了一步，"我许下了承诺。" 他停顿了一下，还有更多话要说，"而且我觉得没有她，我做不到。"

Lilith tilted her head, just examining him, pondering, before continuing. "Then perhaps… there is a way." She paused.  
莉莉丝歪了歪头，只是审视着他，沉思着，然后继续说道。"那么或许…有办法。" 她顿了顿。

"Are you sure?" “你确定吗？”

"Yes, and if you can succeed where others have failed you will find yourself in…"  
"是的，如果你能在别人失败的地方取得成功，你会发现自己身处……"

"I'll do it." He said, cutting her off.  
"我会做到的。" 他打断她的话说道。

"So be it," the figure slowly lifted away from the ledge, "your fate is now molded by your own hands." As the words left her  
"那就这样吧，" 那身影缓缓从窗台上离开，"你的命运现在由你自己塑造。" 当这些话从她口中说出时

Shinji blinked, what did she just say?  
真嗣眨了眨眼，她刚刚说了什么？

CLINK 叮当

The sound of something at his feet made him look down. There on the ground, a pendent, a Greek cross, Misato's. He bent down and picked up the stained metal brushing his finger against the scratched and rusty metal, Shinji still didn't understand.  
脚下传来的声响让他低头看去。地上躺着一枚吊坠，希腊十字架，美里小姐的。他弯腰捡起那沾满污渍的金属，用手指轻抚着刮痕斑斑、锈迹斑斑的表面，真嗣依然一头雾水。

"_Bring this back to me."_  
“把这个带回来给我。”

"Wha…" “什…”

Suddenly something pushed him forwards, and though he fought to keep himself upright, but it was no use, it was one unending force that propelled him forwards. Shinji went over the side and through the shouting and vain attempt to grab onto something, his eye caught the blue-haired figure standing in the exact spot he had been moments ago.  
突然间，一股力量推着他向前，尽管他奋力保持直立，但无济于事，这是一股持续不断的力量，推动他不断前进。真嗣翻过边缘，在呼喊和徒劳地试图抓住某物的过程中，他的目光捕捉到了那个蓝发身影，正站在他刚刚离开的确切位置。

As he plummeted he watched as the ground came rushing towards him, he barely had time to even contemplate this being his death. There was no flash before his eyes, no slowing of time, just him watching in horror as he rocketed towards the pavement.  
当他急速下坠时，他看着地面朝他疾驰而来，几乎没有时间去思考这可能是他的死亡。眼前没有闪光，时间也没有减缓，只有他惊恐地看着自己向路面飞速冲去。

CLANK 咔嗒

Shinji blinked. He was alive.  
真嗣眨了眨眼。他还活着。

His senses came back to him slowly, he was no longer falling, he was standing.  
他的感官慢慢恢复，不再坠落，而是站立着。

In front of him, the payphone's cord swung lazily, still settling from being set down. The boy whipped around, his mind doing its best to process just what had happened before he locked eyes with someone.  
在他面前，电话线的末端懒洋洋地摆动着，仍在从被放下的状态中平复。男孩猛地转身，他的大脑竭力试图理解刚刚发生了什么，直到他与某人四目相对。

Lilith was standing there in the distance, watching him for a second before disappearing, just like last time.  
莉莉丝站在远处，注视了他片刻后再次消失，就像上次一样。

If he was about to hyperventilate, he didn't have time, the VTOL slammed into the ground just like the first time, but he didn't fall over, maybe it was the shock, maybe it was him desensitized to something like this. The only thing he knew for sure was that he was no longer in that small town anymore.  
如果他即将感到呼吸急促，那也没有时间了，垂直起降飞机像第一次那样猛烈撞击地面，但他没有摔倒，或许是震惊，或许是对此类事情已经麻木。他唯一确定的是，自己已不再身处那个小镇。

Suddenly the screeching of tires alerted him to a blue sports car sliding to a stop next to him, not thinking twice, he jumped up and dashed inside as she opened the door.  
突然，轮胎刺耳的摩擦声提醒他，一辆蓝色跑车滑行至他身旁停下，他毫不犹豫地跳起，冲进她打开的车门。

"Hey there. Sorry, I'm late." She barely had time to say, as he slammed the door shut behind him and despite this being the first human he had seen other than Asuka in three months he said nothing.  
“嘿，抱歉，我迟到了。”她几乎没时间说完，因为他砰地一声关上了门，尽管这是三个月来除了明日香之外他见到的第一个人，他却一言不发。

Misato Katsurgi, the last time he had seen of the woman she was trying to encourage him while she bled out. There was no dirt, no cuts, no disheveled hair, she looked happy, healthy, unfettered by the enormous weight of the truth.  
葛城美里，上次见到她时，她正一边流血一边鼓励他。现在她身上没有泥土，没有伤口，没有凌乱的头发，看起来快乐、健康，没有被真相的沉重负担所困扰。

He couldn't help what happened next. He lunged forwards and latched onto the woman, who was certainly taking the whole thing rather well.  
他无法控制接下来发生的事。他向前一扑，紧紧抱住了那个女人，而她显然对这一切表现得相当镇定。

"Hey, I didn't think you'd take that picture so seriously." She said nervously.  
"嘿，我没想到你会对那张照片这么认真。" 她紧张地说道。

Remembering her 'gift', Shinji lurched back, heat flaring in his face, "Sorry, it's just…." He looked out the back window, pointing at the smoldering wreck of the VTOL. Hopefully, she just thought he was a scared boy.  
回想起她的'礼物'，真嗣猛地后退，脸上热辣辣的，"对不起，只是……" 他望向车后窗，指着冒烟的垂直起降机残骸。希望她只当他是个害怕的男孩。

"Oh, yeah, we need to get going."  
"哦，对，我们得赶紧走了。"

As the engine revved and they sped off, Shinji sat there with his hands in his lap, a million thoughts and feelings going through his mind, with a particular one he hadn't felt in a long time.  
引擎轰鸣，他们疾驰而去，真嗣坐在那里，双手放在膝上，脑海中万千思绪与情感交织，其中有一种感觉他已久未体验。

Hope. 希望。

As they drove his mind did its best to think of what to do, where he would find Asuka, if he was back, and she was supposed to come with him... maybe he could contact her through NERV. He was so engrained in though he didn't understand when the woman shouted at him to duck.  
当他们驾车行驶时，他的大脑竭尽全力思考下一步该做什么，他会在哪里找到明日香，如果他回来了，她应该和他一起...也许他可以通过 NERV 联系她。他陷入了深深的思考，以至于没有意识到那位女士对他大喊让他低头。

Confused, the next thing he registered was the car being flung into the air, and he watched helplessly through the windshield at the pressure wave passing them and could do nothing as they raced back to the ground, landing upside-down.  
困惑中，接下来他感觉到的是汽车被抛向空中，他透过挡风玻璃无助地看着压力波从他们身边经过，什么也做不了，只能眼睁睁地看着他们倒栽葱般地坠回地面。

CLANK 咔嗒

Shinji blinked. He was alive.  
真嗣眨了眨眼。他还活着。

He looked around again, hands patting himself down to make sure this was real. Again, the blue-haired figure hovered off in the distance, only to disappear the second after he spotted her.  
他再次环顾四周，双手拍打着自己，确认这一切是否真实。远处，那个蓝头发的身影又一次悬浮着，却在被他发现的那一刻瞬间消失。

Now the hope he had felt swell within him just a second ago gave way to another feeling.  
此刻，刚才一瞬间在他心中涌起的希望，已被另一种感觉所取代。

Dread. 恐惧。

**Sorry for the wait… hope you enjoyed it, honestly the semester is ending so finals and I also got sick so that didn't help.  
抱歉让您久等了……希望您能喜欢，说实话，学期快结束了，期末考试加上我又生病了，真是雪上加霜。**

**So now we know how it all started, honestly the impetus for Lilith/Adam/Rei being able to send Shinji back is when seeing EoE for the first time, I instantly remembered the first episode with what we can assume is the same being there watching Shinji. It's definitely interesting to play with, maybe that's not the last we'll ever see of it? What I like the most about Shinji's choice is while he's logical about wanting to fix things, he almost throws in helping Asuka, using it as justification. Is that wrong? I don't know, it depends on your perspective, but I did know from the beginning that I wanted him to make the conscious choice of fixing things (even if he doesn't know he's going back). Hopefully everything flows properly, the pace felt strange at times, but it is what it is. I might go back and edit it more, but for now I accept it and hey, it's also the longest chapter yet!  
现在我们知道了这一切是如何开始的，老实说，莉莉丝/亚当/丽能够将真嗣送回去的契机，是在我第一次看《EoE》时，立刻就想起了第一集中的场景，我们可以假设是同一个存在在那里观察着真嗣。这确实很有趣，也许那不是我们最后一次见到它？我最喜欢真嗣选择的地方在于，尽管他理智上想要修复一切，但他几乎把帮助明日香作为理由，用以正当化自己的行为。这错了吗？我不知道，这取决于你的视角，但我从一开始就知道，我希望他做出有意识的选择去修复一切（即使他不知道自己会回到过去）。希望一切都能流畅地进行，虽然有时节奏感觉有些奇怪，但这就是现状。我可能会回头再修改，但目前我接受它，而且嘿，这也是迄今为止最长的《1001》！**

**Also, this has a companion piece that'll be out in the next few days, I didn't want to post it right away but it is actually written, it's pretty short but I really like it, there won't be an author's note and shoutouts with it, just because I consider it an extension of this chapter and I want it to be that way. Good news is it's (pretty much) already done!  
另外，我将在接下来几天发布一篇配套作品，本想立即上传，但它其实已经写好了，篇幅颇短但我非常喜欢。届时不会有作者按和致谢，因为我视之为这篇《1001》的延伸，希望保持这种连贯性。好消息是，它（几乎）已经完成了！**

**SHOUTOUTS 致谢**

**NoseGum – Thanks! Glad you liked it, honestly it's not too off the beaten path for post-EoE stories.  
NoseGum – 谢谢！很高兴你喜欢，说实话，这并不算偏离《EoE》后的故事常规。**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – NOPE!  
Da USA 的 UltraSpink – 不！**

**YodaMorpheus7 – Oh don't pull out Alice on me, I'm gonna be tempted to start pulling lines from there! Its no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then!  
YodaMorpheus7 – 哦，别在我面前提爱丽丝，我可忍不住要开始引用那里的台词了！回到昨天毫无用处，因为那时的我和现在不同！**

**DevilOlantern – Thanks, always want to do more!  
DevilOlantern – 谢谢，总想做更多！**

**JIM D. ZAS – Thanks!  
JIM D. ZAS – 谢谢！**

**Guest – I always come back.  
Guest – 我总是会回来。**

**ATTila1987 – The Kaworu parallel is very deliberate, more like the pre-4.0 idea of Kaworu, it's more direct in 4.0 "you conflated your happiness with his happiness", but it's more like a balance. It's alright to take happiness from making people happy, but where does 'end the world for someone' on that scale haha, very Gendo-esc hmmm?  
ATTila1987 – 这个渚薰的平行设定非常刻意，更像 4.0 之前的渚薰概念，4.0 中更直接地表达了“你将自己的幸福与他混为一谈”，但这里更像是一种平衡。从让别人快乐中获得幸福是可以的，但在这个尺度上，“为了某人而结束世界”又该如何衡量呢，哈哈，颇有碇源堂的风格，嗯？**

**EvaPilotFair – Thanks! Happy you enjoyed it, hopefully this was a good reveal.  
EvaPilotFair – 谢谢！很高兴你喜欢，希望这个揭示是好的。**

**engel17white – Yeah, it's not that exciting, but honestly, it's the reality of post EoE. Unless you have the characters be caricatures of themselves, I don't think it's going to be all that exciting. Thanks for being honest though, I really appreciate it.  
engel17white – 是的，这并不那么激动人心，但老实说，这是 EoE 之后的现实。除非角色们变成自己的讽刺漫画，否则我认为不会那么令人兴奋。不过，感谢你的诚实，我非常感激。**

**Guest (2) – ANOTHER ONE!  
访客（2） – 又来一个！**

**Guest (3) – Shinji does deserve more, but it's up to him to earn it.  
访客（3） – 真嗣确实值得更多，但这取决于他如何去争取。**

**Tomdj1701 – Slow update is better than no update.  
Tomdj1701 – 慢更总比不更强。**

**Romulo Nidoking BR – Thank you for all that! I also think that it can be easy to make them caricatures of themselves and I think I've avoided that, but there's still more to come.  
Romulo Nidoking BR – 感谢你们的所有支持！我也认为很容易将他们塑造成自己的漫画形象，我想我已经避免了这一点，但还有更多精彩内容即将呈现。**

**skyf0x – The fox returns! And with two giant reviews. I'm really happy you picked up on a lot of the things in the chapters. Killing Asuka is really cringy for me, unless its very specific circumstances I really don't like it. I'm looking forwards to your views on these next to chapters!  
skyf0x – 狐狸回来了！还带来了两篇巨评。我真的很高兴你注意到了章节中的许多细节。杀死明日香对我来说真的很尴尬，除非是非常特定的情境，否则我真的不喜欢这样做。期待你对接下来两章的看法！**

**Alright, I'll have the complementary chapter up in a few days, but I'm really sad to say that May will be incredibly unproductive for me. Between finals and traveling most of the month is going to be eaten up so don't expect a new chapter soon, but I will be back, sometime in June, I want to finally finish the extended version of Begin Again so that will likely be out first, but after that I'll make sure to have a nice chapter ready.  
好的，我会在几天内发布补充章节chapter，但很遗憾地说，五月对我来说将极其低产。期末考试和大部分时间的旅行将占据这个月，所以不要期待新的chapter很快出现，但我会在六月某个时候回归，我想最终完成《重新开始》的扩展版，那可能会是首发的，之后我会确保准备好一个精彩的chapter。**

**Until Next Time 下次再见**


### Chapter 54: "…What was it he did to break your heart…"  
Chapter 54: "……他究竟做了什么让你心碎……"

You open your eyes to only find a blurry world, a cascading image of rushing colors. Confusion takes you, and panic starts to creep into your once-thought invulnerable heart.  
你睁开双眼，却只见一片模糊的世界，色彩奔涌如瀑布般倾泻。困惑袭来，恐慌开始悄悄侵入你曾以为坚不可摧的心。

You call out his name, wondering where you are, wondering if he was home, wondering why things were so distorted. You need his help, and the thought that what was left of your vision being taken from you nurtures fear in your bones. Again, you call but there's no reply.  
你呼唤他的名字，想知道自己在哪里，想知道他是否在家，想知道为何一切如此扭曲。你需要他的帮助，而仅存的视线被夺走的念头在骨子里滋生恐惧。你再次呼喊，却无人应答。

Where was he? 他究竟在哪里？

Your world clears slowly, bit by bit, light and sound start to filter in, it's like looking through rushing water, but the more you try to see the clearer the image becomes. Ever so slowly, figures, shapes, dancing masses all shift, until you will your world to become clearer.  
你的世界逐渐清晰，一点一滴，光与声开始渗透进来，仿佛透过奔涌的水流，但你越是努力去看，图像就越是清晰。慢慢地，人影、形状、舞动的群体都在变换，直到你渴望世界变得更加清晰。

You're standing and just watching, like some simulation back in Germany. Except it's him you follow, him you're chained to. No one can see you, no matter how much you try, no matter how hard you swing at them, you just go right through them.  
你站在那里，只是观看，就像在德国时的模拟训练。只是这次你追随的是他，你与他紧密相连。无论你如何尝试，无论你如何挥拳，没有人能看到你，你只是径直穿过他们。

It's a bad dream, a nightmare, at any point you think you'll wake up, having fallen asleep on the couch and he would come right back through the door. But it's in vain.  
这是一个糟糕的梦，一场噩梦，你以为随时会醒来，发现自己只是睡在沙发上，而他将从门口回来。但这一切都是徒劳。

You watch as he tries over and over again, living, dying, repeating. You flinch the first time you see him die, only to be right back at a public phone. He's better than he was originally, that's for sure, but his luck has all but evaporated. It's painful just watching him fight the first few Angels, and you have to listen to his screams as he succumbs to the Fifth Angel's blast more times than you can bear to watch.  
你看着他一次又一次地尝试，生生死死，循环往复。第一次看到他死去时，你不禁一颤，结果又回到了一个公共电话旁。他确实比最初进步了，这点毋庸置疑，但他的运气似乎已荡然无存。光是看着他与前几只使徒战斗就让人痛苦不堪，更别提你还得听着他屈服于第五使徒的爆炸声中，那次数多到你无法忍受继续观看。

You try to help; you need to help, to do something. You shout and suggest things, but nothing reaches him, he can't see you, not anymore. No one can see you, you're alone, completely alone.  
你想帮忙；你需要帮忙，做点什么。你大声喊出建议，但一切都传不到他那里，他看不见你，再也看不见了。没有人能看见你，你孤身一人，彻底的孤身一人。

So you just sit and wait, watching helplessly as he's able to advance, he's able to live, he learns, and eventually, he finally makes it further.  
于是你只能坐着等待，无助地看着他能够前进，能够生存，他学习着，最终，他终于走得更远了。

He makes it to you.  
他终于来到了你身边。

His excitement is visible even to you and you wonder why. He left you somehow and came back here, and it's clear he knows why. To you it's such a jarring moment, seeing yourself, watching the familiar scenes, it's unbearable, to watch as some doll replaces you.  
他的兴奋之情连你都能察觉，你不禁疑惑为何如此。他不知怎地离开了你，回到这里，显然他知道原因。对你来说，看到自己，目睹那些熟悉的场景，这感觉如此突兀，难以忍受，仿佛一个玩偶取代了你的位置。

You can tell something is off, he's not acting right, like he was expecting something else. Though it's not long before you they face the Sixth Angel and you can tell he's worried about her as they sink to the bottom of the ocean. It's not the real you, but the idiot can't tell. Eventually, he makes it back again, right back on that aircraft carrier, doing everything you could have ever wanted.  
你能感觉到有些不对劲，他的行为不太正常，似乎在期待着什么。尽管不久后他们面对第六使徒，你看得出他为她担忧，当他们沉入海底时。那不是真正的你，但那个傻瓜却分辨不出。最终，他再次归来，就在那艘航空母舰上，做着你曾经渴望的一切。

And it hurts. 而那很痛。

It hurts so much you'd rather die; you'd rather fade away into nothingness, it's unbearable how he tries to help her. How he brings _her_ food, how he talks to _her_ at night, how he laughs and makes _her_ laugh.  
痛到你宁愿死去；宁愿消散于无形，他试图帮助她的方式令人难以忍受。他如何给她带食物，如何在夜晚与她交谈，如何笑并逗她笑。

Why couldn't he just do that for you?  
为什么他不能那样对你呢？

Finally, that night you've been dreading comes, and just like you did, she asks for a kiss.  
终于，那个你一直害怕的夜晚来临了，就像你曾经做过的那样，她索要一个吻。

You scream and curse, but there's no one there to hear, no one to feel your fury or share your pain. You thought about what you would do in this moment, but you can't help and watch, because even though it hurts, it's all you can feel.  
你尖叫咒骂，但无人倾听，无人感受你的愤怒或分担你的痛苦。你曾想过此刻会怎么做，但你无法自控地注视着，因为尽管痛苦，这却是你唯一能感受到的。

But he won't give her what she wants. No. Apparently, that kiss was only for you.  
但他不会给她想要的。不。显然，那个吻只属于你。

He reaches out, grabing her, and pulls her into a tight embrace, holding her. Just like how you really wanted to be held and you can tell by the look on her face that it means the world to her.  
他伸出手，紧紧抓住她，将她拉入一个紧密的拥抱中，紧紧拥抱着。就像你真正渴望被拥抱那样，从她脸上的表情可以看出，这对她意味着整个世界。

And somehow, that hurts more than a kiss ever could.  
不知为何，这比任何亲吻都更让人心痛。

The cycle continues, he dies, he lives, and he keeps going, trying to prevent the apocalypse. You watch as he starts to break, how he hides away and cries silent tears at night. You watch as the nightmares start to wear down on him and the dark circles become commonplace under his eyes.  
这个循环仍在继续，他死去，他重生，他不断前行，试图阻止末日的降临。你看着他开始崩溃，看着他如何躲藏起来，在夜晚无声地流泪。你看着噩梦开始侵蚀他，眼下的黑眼圈变得司空见惯。

But no matter what happens, no matter his despair or desire, he never takes advantage of her. If he had you don't know what you might have done, what you would have felt. He refuses to kiss her, he refuses to be intimate, even after all her advances.  
但无论发生什么，无论他感到绝望还是渴望，他从未利用过她。如果他那样做了，你不知道自己可能会做出什么，会有怎样的感受。他拒绝亲吻她，拒绝与她亲密，即便在她一再主动之后。

He won't because he remembers you.  
他不会，因为他记得你。

It's the memory that haunts him.  
那段记忆萦绕在他心头，挥之不去。

And you know there is a piece of him that screams that the girls are not you.  
你知道，他内心深处有个声音在呐喊，那些女孩都不是你。

Eventually, he becomes desperate, doing his best to try something else, he's breaking and decides that she'll be better off without him. He tries something different, he pushes the girl away, and you try to scream at him again, knowing just what might happen, that could only lead to something worse.  
最终，他变得绝望，竭尽全力尝试其他方法，他感到自己正在崩溃，认为她没有他会更好。他试图改变策略，将那女孩推开，而你再次试图向他呼喊，深知这可能只会导致更糟糕的后果。

He rejects her that night, and you're left watching him clutch a dying girl.  
那晚他拒绝了她的爱意，而你只能眼睁睁看着他紧抱着一个濒死的女孩。

And you're left to witness his self-destruction. Over and over, as if he's running to his death every single life, wishing it to end, wanting it to be over. He's broken and he knows it, he runs into battle, just wanting things to be over, not caring for the consequences of his actions.  
你被迫目睹他的自我毁灭。一遍又一遍，仿佛他每一次转世都在奔向死亡，渴望终结，希望一切结束。他支离破碎，心知肚明，冲向战场，只求解脱，不顾行为后果。

You're forced to watch as the boy who you wanted more than anything to acknowledge you, loses all hope, and finally, you've had enough. Because you can't watch it anymore, because it breaks your heart just that bit more every time, because, in the end, you need him.  
你被迫看着那个你无比渴望得到他认可的男孩，失去所有希望，最终，你忍无可忍。因为你无法再继续目睹这一切，因为每一次都让你的心碎得更深，因为归根结底，你需要他。

So, you scream and claw at him, at this invisible force keeping you from speaking with him. You don't let up, not even for a second, you keep trying, willing yourself to reach him just like you willed yourself to see the world.  
于是，你尖叫着，用爪子抓向他，抓向这股无形的力量，它阻止你与他交谈。你毫不松懈，一刻也不停，你不断尝试，努力让自己触及他，就像你努力让自己看到这个世界一样。

And it works. 而它奏效了。

For once he hears you, or he hears something, something that makes him hesitate just enough to talk with someone. You reach out to him again and again, and before long it's over; he's starting to care again.  
这一次，他听见了你，或者说他听见了什么，那声音让他犹豫了那么一瞬，足以让他与某人交谈。你一次又一次地向他伸出手，不久之后，一切结束了；他开始重新关心起来。

But he's not the same, he's focused on her. He'll stop the world from ending, fighting Angels, his father, SEELE, but his drive is helping her, his life is saving her.  
但他已非昔日之他，他的心思全在她身上。他会阻止世界末日，与使徒战斗，对抗他的父亲，对抗 SEELE，但他的动力是帮助她，他的生命是为了拯救她。

So, you keep pushing, you keep clawing, you keep shouting until the barrier fails, and he can not only hear you, he can see you.  
所以，你不断推动，不断抓挠，不断呼喊，直到屏障崩溃，他不仅能听到你，还能看见你。

But to him, you're a ghost, you're his mind finally losing its grasp on reality and to be fair you can't really blame him. He's lost count of how many times he's gone through this and so have you. Even though he'll talk to you, even though he'll see you, he doesn't truly understand. He doesn't really see you anymore.  
但在他眼里，你如同幽灵，是他心灵终于失去对现实的掌控，平心而论，你也无法真正责怪他。他已经数不清这是第几次经历这一切，你也一样。尽管他会与你交谈，尽管他会看见你，但他并未真正理解。他不再真正地看见你。

He promised. He promised to always see you, to always be there for you, and he won't listen now, he still cares for those girls when you are there, stabbing you with every hug, adding a crack to your heart with every smile, every small gesture.  
他曾承诺过。他承诺会永远注视你，永远在你身边，而现在他却不愿倾听，即使你在场，他依然关心那些女孩，每一次拥抱都像在刺痛你，每一个微笑、每一个小动作都在你心上添一道裂痕。

Your world is cold and empty, the only light and warmth you know comes from him, when you talk, when you fight, when you bicker, you just want him to acknowledge you. It's so much worse than before, so much colder, since it's only him who can make a difference.  
你的世界冰冷而空洞，你所知的唯一光明与温暖来自他，无论是交谈、争吵还是斗嘴，你只希望他能注意到你。情况比以前糟糕得多，更加寒冷，因为只有他能带来改变。

Until he sees the truth, he remembers why you should hate him, he remembers and now sees you, truly sees you.  
直到他看清真相，记起你为何应该恨他，他记起了，现在真正看到了你。

When he opens his eyes, the look on his face hurts, it hurts more than any sight of him holding another girl at night.  
当他睁开眼睛时，脸上的表情令她心痛，比看到他夜晚拥着别的女孩还要痛。

It hurts more than hearing him promise that he'd never leave those fakes of you.  
比听到他承诺永远不会离开那些虚假的你还要痛。

It hurts more than a kiss ever could.  
比任何吻都更让她心痛。

Because now you understand.  
因为现在你明白了。

He was always trying to help you, he was trying to be there for you, he was trying to save you, not her, not any of them, you.  
他一直在努力帮助你，他试图在你身边，他试图拯救你，不是她，不是他们中的任何一个，是你。

He always loved you. 他一直爱着你。

And it finally shatters your heart.  
而它最终还是粉碎了你的心。

This is what it feels like to be Asuka Langley Soryu, now and forever.  
这就是此刻以及永远作为惣流·明日香·兰格雷的感觉。


### Chapter 55: "…Behind Blue Eyes…"  
Chapter 55: "…湛蓝眼眸之后…"

"_Professor."_ “教授。”

_He had told her not to call him that anymore, as far as he was concerned she had long since surpassed him. He didn't scold her however, instead the man's eyes widened, despite his age, he had never held a child before, but the way the woman was looking at him forced him to hold out his arms. She trusted him, completely, unequivocally, she trusted him.  
他曾告诉她不要再那样称呼他了，在他看来，她早已超越了他。然而，他并未责备她，相反，男人的眼睛瞪大了，尽管年岁已高，他从未抱过孩子，但女人看着他的方式迫使他伸出了双臂。她信任他，毫无保留，坚定不移，她信任他。_

_Just like he trusted her.  
正如他信任她一样。_

_The weight now resting in his hands wasn't more than a few pounds, and it was small, no larger than a loaf of bread. Yet, somehow it dragged him down, like gravity upon space-time, it seemed too hard to hold, yet he dared not loosen his grip.  
此刻躺在他手中的重量不过几磅，体积也不大，不超过一条面包。然而，不知为何它却沉重无比，仿佛时空中的重力，看似难以承受，他却不敢松手。_

_His old muscles were stiff, even back then he had begun to feel his age, but it was due to what the elder realized he held in his hands… the potential. There was no experiment, no theory, no unread stack of books that could compete with the bundle in his hands.  
他的老肌肉僵硬，即便那时他已开始感受到岁月的痕迹，但这一切都源于老者意识到他手中所握之物……那股潜力。没有任何实验、理论，或是未曾翻阅的书籍堆能够与手中的这捆东西相媲美。_

_There was nothing he knew of that could compete with the potential of a new human life.  
他所知的一切都无法与一个新生命所蕴含的潜力相抗衡。_

"_Here," she giggled, clearly amused by her former mentor's discomfort. Somehow that voice always gave him more energy. She reached out and adjusted bundle in the older man's arms, "like this."_  
“这样，”她咯咯笑着，显然被前导师的不适逗乐了。不知为何，她的声音总能给他带来更多活力。她伸出手，调整了老者怀中的襁褓，“像这样。”

_Futyuski stayed silent, examining the child swaddled in his blue blanket, those blue eyes staring back up at him. Despite the cubby face, he could still see the resemblance in the chin to his father and he pondered what genes he might have inherited from his mother.  
富图斯基保持沉默，仔细打量着裹在蓝色毯子里的孩子，那双蓝色的眼睛回望着他。尽管脸庞稚嫩，他仍能从下巴看出与父亲的相似之处，并思索着孩子可能从母亲那里继承了哪些基因。_

_Would he become a spot of light in this dim world? Would he be cold and calculating? Would he even care to follow the paths of his parents? Would there even be a world for him to have a chance to decide?  
他是否会成为这个昏暗世界中的一束光芒？他会冷漠而精于算计吗？他是否会愿意追随父母的足迹？甚至，是否还有一片天地能让他有机会做出选择？_

_What kind of person would this child choose to become?  
这个孩子会选择成为什么样的人呢？_

"_Were you surprised?" he asked, looking up at his former student._  
"你感到惊讶吗？" 他抬头看着他以前的学生问道。

"_Not at all," She said, smiling "Gendo was adamant it would be a girl, but I knew from the first kick it was a boy."_  
"一点也不，" 她微笑着说，"源渡坚持认为会是个女孩，但我从第一次胎动就知道是个男孩。"

"_What's his name?"_ "他叫什么名字？"

"_Shinji."_ “真嗣。”

ʡʘʘʘʢ

Fuyutsuki peered out at the massive hangar from his seat. Down below a pair of massive figures dragged the corpse of a Wanderer in, its body being added to the pile for processing.  
冬月从座位上向外凝视着巨大的机库。下方，一对庞大的身影拖着一具流浪者的尸体进入，其躯体被添加到待处理的堆放中。

Rows of torsos and appendages lined the walls, racks of components for evangelion's all harvested from those created by the Near Third Impact. It was a miracle they had been able to continue on, though he doubted the commander would agree.  
墙壁上排列着一排排躯干和肢体，从近第三次冲击中诞生的使徒身上采集的福音战士组件架满了一排排。他们能继续下去简直是个奇迹，尽管他怀疑指挥官不会这么认为。

It wasn't the only thing the men didn't see eye to eye on.  
这并不是他们唯一意见不合的事情。

The boy. Fuyutsuki knew if his father would not confront him, then it was time he did, even if he was wrong, the boy deserved to know the truth about his mother, his father, even Rei.  
那个男孩。冬月知道，如果他的父亲不面对他，那么是时候由他来做了，即使他错了，那个男孩也应该知道关于他母亲、他父亲，甚至是丽真相。

He had once told Ikari that it was almost cruel how they had planned to manipulate the children. 'The script, the story of their lives' he had said, but now maybe it wasn't going to be so simple.  
他曾告诉碇，他们计划操纵孩子们的生活几乎是一种残忍。‘剧本，他们生命的故事’他曾说过，但现在或许事情不会那么简单了。

Fuyutsuki took a deep breath and closed his eyes as he stood, flexing his knuckles slightly and wincing at the pain of his old joints.  
冬月深吸一口气，闭上双眼，站立时微微活动指关节，因老迈关节的疼痛而微微皱眉。

Time, it seemed, has not been as kind to him as Ikari's son.  
时间似乎并未像对碇的儿子那般善待他。

ʡʘʘʘʢ

Soryu just slowly walked behind the boy, she was doing her best to ignore the clone next to her, but it was becoming more and more boring by the second. Shinji's sleepwalking hadn't been such an issue if they were in Misato's apartment, but here? It was asking for trouble.  
Soryu 只是缓缓地跟在男孩身后，她尽力忽视身旁的克隆体，但每一秒都变得越来越无聊。如果是在 Misato 的公寓里，真嗣的梦游还不算什么大问题，但在这里？简直是自找麻烦。

"What exactly happened?" She asked. She had been talking to that 'young' Shinji, before finding herself back here. There was no warning, she had just blinked and she was back.  
“究竟发生了什么？”她问道。在与那个“年轻”的真嗣交谈后，她发现自己又回到了这里。没有任何预兆，她只是眨了眨眼，就回到了原处。

"He needed to remember." Rei explained.  
"他需要记住。" 丽解释道。

"So why was I here?" Asuka asked, "Is it because he dragged me back with him?"  
"那我为什么在这里？" 明日香问道，"是因为他把我拖回来的吗？"

Rei tilted her head "Can you not see them?"  
丽歪了歪头 "你难道看不见他们吗？"

Asuka rolled her eyes, "See what?"  
明日香翻了个白眼，“看什么？”

"His memories." “他的记忆。”

The girl frowned, "I had my fair share of that Wondergirl." Asuka said quietly, not bothering to hide the bitterness in her voice, "I'm not going to do it again."  
女孩皱起眉头，“我已经受够了那个奇迹女孩。”明日香平静地说道，毫不掩饰声音中的苦涩，“我不会再做一次了。”

"That is strange, because you are a part of him."  
"那很奇怪，因为你也是他的一部分。"

"What are you talking about Wondergirl," Asuka growled, "I am me. Nobody else."  
"你在说什么呢，奇迹少女，" 明日香咆哮道，"我就是我。不是别人。"

"You are not like me."  
"你和我不同。"

"Clearly." Asuka grumbled.  
"显然。" 明日香咕哝道。

"I am contained within him; he is a vessel for me."  
"我寄居于他体内；他是我的容器。"

"He just had to save you, didn't he?" Asuka mumbled under her breath, "Had to ruin the quiet I get around here."  
"他非得救你不可，是吧？" 明日香低声嘀咕，"非得破坏我在这里的宁静。"

"But you cannot see his being, you should be able to."  
"但你无法看见他的存在，你应该能的。"

"Don't tell me what I can and cannot do! Why don't you tell me who's been stuck with him longer, hmm Wondergirl?  
"别告诉我我能做什么不能做什么！你怎么不告诉我谁和他纠缠得更久，嗯，小奇女？

"Curious," She said simply, as always, Rei's face didn't betray her emotions.  
"好奇，"她简单地说，一如既往，丽的面容没有泄露她的情绪。

Asuka was done talking, and just continued to follow the boy, observing him weaving around the debris and holes lining the hallways. Before she had more time to dwell on the matter he stopped, leading both specters to look at one another.  
明日香已经不想再说话，只是继续跟着那个男孩，观察他在走廊上绕过碎片和坑洞的身姿。还没等她有更多时间深思，他就停了下来，让两个幽灵彼此对视。

She took the first step, walking around the boy to find his eyes shut.  
她迈出了第一步，绕过男孩，发现他的眼睛紧闭着。

"It would be great if you'd just WAKE UP IDIOT!" she yelled, knowing it was in vain as her voice failed to produce an echo in the halls.  
“你要是能醒过来就好了，白痴！”她喊道，明知这是徒劳，因为她的声音在走廊里连回声都没有。

He twitched, and his eyelids began to shudder. She watched as they opened slowly, letting those blue orbs give her a look she would never forget.  
他微微抽搐，眼睑开始颤动。她注视着它们缓缓张开，那双湛蓝的眼眸投来的目光，她永生难忘。

Shinji saw her. 真嗣看到了她。

ʡʘʘʘʢ

As soon as he opened his eyes he knew.  
他一睁开眼便明白了。

It was her. It was always her.  
就是她。一直都是她。

His words caught in his throat at first, he wanted nothing more than to reach out to her, to say something, to do anything for her. He felt so useless, like he was back on the rooftop after Arael, incapable of helping her.  
他的话起初哽在喉咙里，他只想伸出手去触碰她，说些什么，做些什么来帮助她。他感到如此无用，仿佛回到了 Arael 事件后的屋顶，无力帮助她。

The look she was giving him wasn't something he remembered her ever showing. A look that made him want to fall to his knees and ask forgiveness. He watched as that single eye began to water despite her clear attempts to shutter all emotions.  
她投向他的目光，是他记忆中从未见过的。那种让他想跪下请求宽恕的眼神。他看着她那只眼睛开始泛起泪光，尽管她明显在努力抑制所有情感。

"Asuka I…" "明日香，我……"

Just her name must have been too much for the girl to handle, instantly she turned, before disappearing from sight. Could he blame her? How long had he denied her existence? How long had he ignored her?  
仅仅她的名字就让女孩难以承受，她立刻转身，随即消失在视野中。他能怪她吗？他否认她的存在多久了？他又忽视她多久了？

"Asuka!" he shouted, but he was only met with silence.  
"明日香！" 他喊道，却只得到了沉默的回应。

"_Perhaps she is not ready either." Rei said behind him._  
"或许她也没有准备好。" 在他身后的绫波说道。

Shinji turned, eyeing the girl, "What did you do?"  
真嗣转过身，打量着女孩，“你做了什么？”

"_Nothing you did not want already," she explained, "I gave you a chance to remember, had you not wanted to, you would not have done it."_  
"你本就不想忘记的，" 她解释道，"我给了你回忆的机会，如果你不愿意，你就不会这么做。"

"How?" “怎么？”

"_You are my vessel; I can see your being. I simply… helped."_  
"你是我的容器；我能感知你的存在。我只是……帮了点忙。"

"Helped?!" Shinji said incredulously.  
"帮忙？！" 真嗣难以置信地说。

"_You were distressed about your inability to remember your first life, but I did not force you to remember, that was your choice."_  
"你曾因无法记起前世而感到苦恼，但我并未强迫你回忆，那是你自己的选择。"

Shinji shook his head, he remembered, he had practically relived it, unable to do or say anything differently. Now he knew, he couldn't have back then but…  
真嗣摇了摇头，他记得，他几乎重温了那段经历，无法做出任何不同的举动或说出不同的话。现在他明白了，当时他不可能做到，但是……

'Then perhaps… there is a way.'  
'那么或许……还有办法。'

Damn whatever that was. 该死的，不管那是什么。

Had he remembered what that figure said when he first saw Soryu? Had he known and ignored it? When had he forgotten about his choice to do all this?  
他是否记得初次见到 Soryu 时那身影所说的话？他是否知情却置之不理？他何时忘记了这一切都是自己选择的结果？

This was his fault, no, this was his choice. He had chosen to do this, to come back, he had agreed to this hell. But if he had known then, if he had known exactly what was going to happen, would he have waited, would he have chosen differently?  
这是他的错，不，这是他的选择。他选择了这样做，选择回来，他同意了这场地狱般的安排。但如果他当时就知道，如果他确切知道会发生什么，他会等待吗，他会做出不同的选择吗？

His feet carried him as his mind wandered, he ignored the world on his own, so deep in thought that he didn't need his SDAT player.  
他的双脚带着他前行，思绪却早已飘远，他独自沉浸在自己的世界里，深陷于思考之中，以至于不再需要他的 SDAT 播放器。

Asuka. She had been there this whole time, had she seen what he had done? Had she seen everything? Did she see his greatest failure to her?  
明日香。她一直都在那里，她是否看到了他所做的一切？她是否目睹了他最大的失败？

The thought of her seeing what he had done for them, his mind raced back to the last night he had spent with Shikinami and the morning after. What did he put her through? At that thought a weight fell into his gut, he felt nauseous, and while the desire to empty his stomach contents suddenly became very appealing, it never came.  
想到她目睹了他为他们所做的一切，他的思绪急速回溯到与式波共度的最后一晚及次日清晨。他让她经历了什么？这个念头如重石压在心头，他感到一阵恶心，尽管那一刻他很想呕吐，却终究没有发生。

He had tortured her. There was no other way to describe it. He had poured salt in whatever wounds she had with every life he lived. How had she felt no longer being seen by him?  
他曾折磨过她。没有其他词能更准确地描述这一点。他每活一次，就在她所有的伤口上撒盐。她不再被他看见，这种感觉又是怎样的呢？

"Third Child?" “三子？”

Everything he had done to help them, no her, all of it did the opposite, she had spent an eternity watching him do his best to help. They were just dolls to her, and he had only been there for them.  
他为他们所做的一切，不，是为她，所有这些都适得其反，她花了一辈子的时间看着他尽最大努力帮助。对她来说，他们只是玩偶，而他只是为了他们而存在。

"Shinji." “真嗣。”

The boy came back to reality, blinking, he looked around him for the source of the noise, and finally to the person seated off to his side.  
男孩回过神来，眨了眨眼，环顾四周寻找噪音的来源，最终看向坐在他旁边的人。

"Tell me, do you play Shogi?"  
“告诉我，你会下将棋吗？”

ʡʘʘʘʢ

"You only have 31 moves before you're in checkmate."  
“你只剩下 31 步就会将死。”

Shinji watched the man stared at the board with what he could tell was his strongest poker face. That didn't surprise him, given the man's number two status at NERV and being involved with his father's plans. What did surprise him was the grin that grew on his face after the realization he had been beat.  
真嗣看着那男人用他所能察觉的最强扑克脸盯着棋盘。这并不让他惊讶，毕竟此人是 NERV 的二把手，并参与了他父亲的计划。真正让他惊讶的是，当意识到自己已经败北后，那男人脸上绽放的笑容。

"I never knew you were so good," He commented, admitting defeat as he cleaned up the pieces, "had I known I would have asked you for a game years ago. You could probably give your father quite the challenge too."  
“我从不知道你这么厉害，”他一边收拾棋子一边承认失败，“早知道的话，几年前就该找你下棋了。你大概也能给你的父亲带来不小的挑战吧。”

"It was… a good distraction," Shinji admitted, ignoring the comment about his father, "When I got tired of music, well, it helped."  
"这……是个不错的消遣。" 真嗣承认道，避开了关于他父亲的评论，"当我厌倦了音乐时，嗯，它确实有帮助。"

The elder smiled as he flipped the pieces out onto the board, signaling a new game. "I'll try again then," he said, taking a piece from the pile, "I wanted to thank you for taking time to humor an old man with his hobby. I'm easily daunted as well you see; without some sort of pretext, I doubt I would have been able to speak with you like this."  
老者微笑着将棋子翻出摆到棋盘上，示意新的一局开始。“那我再试一次，”他说着从棋堆中拿起一枚棋子，“我想感谢你抽出时间来陪一个老人玩他的爱好。我也很容易感到胆怯，你看；如果没有某种借口，我怀疑自己是否能像这样与你交谈。”

Shinji slowly took his pieces, but rarely tore his eyes away from the man across from him. This was such an oddity. How many times had he actually had more than a passing interaction with his father's second in command? A dozen, two dozen, maybe?  
真嗣慢慢地拿起自己的棋子，但很少将目光从对面的人身上移开。这真是件奇事。他与父亲副手有过多少次不止于擦肩而过的交流呢？十次，二十次，或许？

"Tell me," Fuyutsuki spoke up, "do you remember much of your mother?"  
“告诉我，”冬月开口问道，“你还记得你母亲多少？”

Under the short table, Shinji's hand balled into a fist on his knee.  
在小桌下，真嗣的手在膝盖上紧握成拳。

"No." he said, looking away, trying to hide that bitterness in his voice by distracting himself with the pieces, "I…"  
“不。”他别开视线，试图用棋子分散自己的注意力，以掩盖声音中的苦涩，“我……”

Shinji's train of thought was interrupted by a photo held out towards him. He reached out, grabbing the picture and looked it over. His mother, holding what only could be him, around a crowd of people he felt he could vaguely recognize.  
真嗣的思绪被一张递向他的照片打断了。他伸出手，抓住照片仔细端详。他的母亲，抱着一个显然是他自己的婴儿，周围是一群他觉得有些模糊熟悉的人。

He could feel Fuyutsuki's gaze on him, judging his every slight movement, gauging his reaction to what should be the first sight of his mother. Why was he doing this?  
他能感觉到冬月在注视着他，审视着他每一个细微的动作，评估他对母亲形象的第一反应。他为什么要这么做？

"That woman is your mother. Her name was Yui Ayanami, she was a student of mine at the university," he explained, "and now she serves at the control system for EVA Unit-01"  
“那个女人是你的母亲。她名叫绫波唯，是我大学时期的学生，”他解释道，“现在她负责 EVA 初号机的控制系统。”

Suddenly his vision exploded in blinding light for a moment before adjusting. Some light had been switched on above them much to the man's satisfaction. "Ah, it seems the power has been restored to this part of the facility." Fuyutsuki commented.  
突然间，他的视野被一阵刺眼的光芒炸裂，片刻后才适应过来。上方有人打开了灯光，这让男子颇为满意。“啊，看来设施的这部分电力已经恢复了。”冬月评论道。

Behind them, a red light illuminated and Shinji turned to watch a massive red cross-like structure being raised. Inside the humanoid indent, two cores sat, seemingly waiting for a new body.  
在他们身后，一盏红灯亮起，真嗣转身望去，一个巨大的红色十字形结构正在升起。在人形凹槽内，两个核心静静地坐着，仿佛在等待新的躯体。

NERV's proclivity for cavernous underground rooms was really starting to annoy him.  
NERV 那些巨大的地下房间，真的开始让他感到烦躁了。

"This is the prototype for the EVAs control system, though now it serves as the Crucible for Project Wanyūdō. When it was first completed, Yui envisioned the method of direct entry into the core and she attempted it with herself as the test subject in this very system."  
这是 EVA 控制系统原型机，如今则作为 Project Wanyūdō的熔炉。当初完成时，Yui 设想了直接进入核心的方法，并亲自作为测试对象在此系统中尝试。

Shinji just looked back at the photo, unsure how to respond. Nothing truly was earthshattering to him, and while he fain shock, he was just too tired right now.  
真嗣只是回头看着那张照片，不知该如何回应。对他来说，没有什么真正是震撼的，尽管他假装震惊，但他现在只是太累了。

"You watched it too, though your memories have since been erased. Upon entry she disappeared within the system. All that remains of her is the data used for the Ayanami series. The Rei Ayanami you have come to know is nothing more than a replicant of your mother."  
你也目睹了这一切，尽管你的记忆已被抹去。她进入系统后便消失了。她留下的只有用于制造绫波系列的数据。你所认识的绫波丽，不过是你的母亲的复制品。

Shinji just kept setting up his side of the board as he listened, glancing up at the elder every so often then back to the picture. There were three other adults around his mother, two men and a woman. He didn't recognize the men, they couldn't be his father nor Fuyutsuki, but the woman, she was familiar, he just couldn't put his finger on it.  
真嗣只是继续摆放着自己这边的棋子，一边听着，不时抬头看一眼那位长者，然后又回到画面上。在他母亲周围还有三个成年人，两个男人和一个女人。他不认识那两个男人，他们既不是他的父亲也不是冬月，但那个女人，她很眼熟，只是他一时想不起来。

"It's all part of your father's plan you see. Ikari is making a bounty of sacrifices, including his very own soul, I felt it was only right that you know some of the truth and about your father."  
“这都是你父亲计划的一部分，你看。碇司令正在做出巨大的牺牲，包括他自己的灵魂，我觉得你有权知道一些真相，以及关于你父亲的事情。”

Shinji couldn't bring himself to act shocked, he couldn't even muster an ounce of bewilderment. Instead, he just kept placed the last of his shoji pieces, as if the man had said nothing.  
真嗣无法表现出震惊，甚至连一丝困惑都挤不出来。相反，他只是继续摆放着最后几枚棋子，仿佛那人什么都没说。

"You seem… unmoved by this." The man commented, "Though perhaps it's not so extraordinary, you see now why your father did what he did, the resemblance is... well…." He strayed off as he finished setting up his own side of the board.  
"你似乎…对此无动于衷。" 那人评论道，"虽然也许并不那么出奇，你现在明白你父亲为何那样做了，你们之间的相似之处是...嗯…" 他边说边摆弄着自己那边的棋盘，话音渐弱。

"It's shocking how simple it is to tear the world apart, but rebuilding it, that isn't so easy."  
"撕裂世界竟是如此简单，但重建它，就没那么容易了。"

"I know," the boy replied, that weight in his chest a bit too heavy "I can't remember the last time I wasn't trying to fix it."  
"我知道，" 男孩回答，胸中的重负愈发沉重，"我记不清上一次不是在试图修复它是什么时候了。"

Shinji's heart skipped at the words that had left his mouth. They had just slipped out on their own, how could he let that happen?  
听到自己脱口而出的话，真嗣的心跳漏了一拍。这些话竟不自觉地溜了出来，他怎么会让这种事发生呢？

"Yes, I suppose we all have." He replied, "I once thought, like time itself, the course of the world could not be reversed. Although…" he stopped, moving his first piece. "I may have been wrong about that all along." Fuyuki said, moving his first piece.  
“是的，我想我们都有过这样的想法。”他回答道，“我曾经以为，就像时间本身一样，世界的进程无法逆转。尽管……”他停顿了一下，移动了第一枚棋子。“我可能一直都在错。”冬木说着，移动了他的第一枚棋子。

"What are you saying?" Shinji asked, moving one of his own pawns.  
“你在说什么？”真嗣问道，移动了自己的一枚棋子。

"Dr. Katsuragi was a brilliant man, someone whom many would consider to border on the obsessive." Fuyutsuki explained moving another pawn, "He was our lead researcher before the Second Impact and ultimately succumbed to the event." The man mused, his handing coming up to brush his freshly shaven face. "He had so many theories, Dirac Seas, Anti-AT fields, when he presented them to us each was more impossible than the last."  
"碇博士是个才华横溢的人，许多人认为他近乎偏执。" 冬月解释道，移动了另一个卒子，"他在第二次冲击前是我们的首席研究员，最终在那场事件中丧生。" 他沉思着，手抬起轻触刚剃过的脸颊。"他有许多理论，狄拉克之海，反 AT 力场，他向我们展示的每一个都比上一个更不可思议。"

Shinji said nothing, moving another pawn again.  
真嗣一言不发，再次移动了一个卒子。

"It wasn't till these last 10 years when I had the desire and time to mule over them."  
"直到这过去的十年，我才有欲望和时间去仔细研究它们。"

Shinji stayed silent as they both moved another pawn, though he was barely trying. It was simply more prudent he paid attention to whatever this man was trying to get at and while he watched Fuyutsuki move his bishop, it was the next words from his mouth that would change everything.  
碇真嗣沉默着，两人又各自移动了一个兵，但他几乎没怎么用心。眼下，他只是更为谨慎地留意着这个男人试图表达的意图。当他在观察冬月移动他的象时，对方接下来的话却彻底改变了一切。

"If you knew the outcome of coming to see your father and piloting Unit-01… would you have done it?"  
"如果你知道来看你父亲并驾驶初号机会导致这样的结果……你还会这么做吗？"

Shinji's hand stopped mid-reach for his rook. "What's that supposed to mean?" he asked.  
真嗣伸向车子的手停在了半空中。“你这是什么意思？”他问道。

"Humor an old man," he said, the edge of his lip curling to the discomfort of Shinji. "if you knew this would be the result of your actions, what would you have done differently?"  
"就当是哄哄我这个老头子，"他说，嘴角微微上扬，让真嗣感到不适。"如果你事先知道你的行为会导致这样的结果，你会怎么做？"

Shinji's eyes never left his opponents and suddenly something alien washed over him.  
真嗣的目光始终未曾离开对手，突然间，一种异样的感觉涌遍全身。

The feeling of being seen.  
那种被注视的感觉。

Of being completely transparent with nothing he could hide.  
仿佛完全透明，无所遁形。

"How would I know?" he finally said, finishing his move.  
“我怎么会知道？”他终于说道，完成了他的走棋。

Futyuski chuckled, "It's purely an academic question. One I've found to be asking myself all too much."  
富津斯基轻笑道：“这纯粹是个学术问题。我发现自己问得太多了。”

Shinji watched as one of his pawns moved closer to his line, but the pit in his stomach simply grew at every word.  
真嗣看着自己的一个兵向前靠近了底线，但每听一个字，他的胃里就更加翻江倒海。

"Dr. Katsuragi developed a theory, where an individual could be… trapped… repeating their life. Living, dying, they would have no meaning, they would have equal value to them." He explained, "I never truly believed in much of his research, the quantum mechanics alone were enough to make my old mind spin, but… well if the last 30 years of my life have taught me anything it's that I should be… open to more possibilities."  
"Dr. Katsuragi 提出了一种理论，认为一个人可能会被困在不断重复的生活中。活着，死去，这一切对他们来说毫无意义，其价值等同于无。" 他解释道，"我从未真正相信过他的大部分研究，单是量子力学就足以让我的老脑筋转不过来，但是……好吧，过去 30 年的生活教会了我一件事，那就是我应该……对更多可能性保持开放态度。"

"Why are you telling me this?" Shinji said while moving his bishop.  
"你为什么要告诉我这些？" 真嗣说着，移动了他的象。

"I'm simply asking what you might think that person would be like." The man said, moving a pawn, "To know no limit to their ability, unconstrained by time, able to accumulate lifetimes worth of knowledge."  
"我只是想问问你，你认为那样的人会是什么样的。" 那人说道，移动了一个兵，"知道自己的能力没有极限，不受时间限制，能够积累几辈子的知识。"

"I think," Shinji said, as he moved a pawn forward, "it would be a living hell. I think whoever was cursed with such a thing, they would do everything to make it end."  
"我认为，" 真嗣说着，将一枚兵向前移动，"那将是活生生的地狱。我想，无论是谁被诅咒了这种能力，他们都会竭尽全力让它结束。"

"Really?" the man asked as he took his turn, "I imagine it would be an effortless existence, to know everything about anything, to sharpen skills to unseen or imagined limits. To ordinary people, someone such as that would be more of a god, and every one of us his playthings."  
"真的吗？" 那人问道，同时走了一步棋，"我想那将是一种毫不费力的生活，知晓一切事物的所有奥秘，将技能磨练到前所未有的或想象中的极限。对普通人来说，那样的人更像是一位神，而我们每个人都是他的玩物。"

"I," Shinji stopped himself, before gently pushing a pawn forward, "I wouldn't call someone like that a god." He most certainly wasn't, at least not anymore.  
"我，" 真嗣顿了顿，然后轻轻地向前推了一枚兵，"我不会称那样的人为神。" 他当然不再是了，至少现在不是。

"Imagine if nothing you ever did really mattered." Shinji said, "Imagine everyone you've ever known, every accomplishment or success you've ever had, being wiped clean, to someone like that, it would be such a lonely existence."  
"想象一下，如果你所做的一切都无关紧要。" 真嗣说道，"想象一下你认识的每一个人，你所有的成就或成功都被抹去，对那样的人来说，那将是多么孤独的存在。"

"Like I said, those around him would be little more than his pawns." Fuyutsuki mused, bringing, his pawn forwards and taking Shinji's for first blood, "They would know all about them already, their hopes, their dreams and desires, and what exactly to give them."  
"就像我说的，他周围的人不过是他的棋子。" 冬月沉思着，将自己的兵向前推进，并率先吃掉了真嗣的兵，"他们已经对他们了如指掌，他们的希望、梦想和欲望，以及究竟该给他们什么。"

"You must be incredibly lonely." Shinji said softly, hiding the pity in his voice as he placed sent his bishop into the far side of the board, collecting the man's silver general.  
"你一定非常孤独。" 真嗣轻声说道，隐藏着声音中的同情，将自己的象移到棋盘的另一侧，吃掉了对方的银将。

Fuyutsuki said nothing, merely sliding his gold general to take the piece and allowing him to continue.  
冬月一言不发，只是将自己的金将移至对方棋子前将其吃掉，任由他继续。

"If you view someone like that, if you start to see someone as just an object you just build or fix or use, then are they anything more than a possession? Could you even be called human at that point?" Shinji asked, as he took a pawn with his lance.  
“如果你这样看待某人，如果你开始将某人仅仅视为一个你可以建造、修复或利用的对象，那么他们还能算得上是比一件物品更多的存在吗？到了那个地步，你还能被称为人吗？”真嗣问道，同时用他的枪兵取了一个兵。

"I don't know, would you be?" Fuyutsuki asked, his own lance taking Shinji's piece.  
"我不知道，你会吗？" 冬月问道，他自己的枪吃掉了真嗣的棋子。

"This is still an academic discussion, or are you going somewhere with this?" Shinji narrowed his eyes, as his rook took the man's lance.  
"这仍然是一个学术讨论，还是你有什么深意？" 真嗣眯起眼睛，他的车吃掉了对方的枪。

Fuyutsuki advanced his pawn, before staring out over the board and sighing, "With age comes a certain view, time suddenly feels short, so perhaps I should have chosen a more direct method to approach you, but here we are."  
冬月推进了他的兵，然后凝视着棋盘叹了口气，"随着年龄的增长，会有一种特定的视角，时间突然显得短暂，所以也许我应该选择一种更直接的方式来接近你，但我们还是到了这里。"

Shinji felt the pit in his stomach only grow as his rook took another pawn.  
真嗣感到胃里的不安愈发强烈，因为他的车又吃掉了一个兵。

"Returning from the dead once may be looked over, but twice is truly an accomplishment…" Fuyutsuki mused, his rook collecting Shinji's. The boy couldn't conjure an ounce of annoyance at himself for failing to see it, not with this man in front of him. He just calmly took the piece with another pawn.  
"从死里逃生一次或许可以被忽略，但两次就真是不简单了……" 冬月沉思着，他的车吃掉了真嗣的棋子。真嗣无法对自己未能预见到这一步感到丝毫恼怒，面对眼前这位长者，他只是平静地用另一个兵取走了对方的棋子。

"You're more than capable of seeing that Shinji, I think we both know it." Fuyutsuki said, pushing his remaining silver general in front of the golden, "The synchronization scores, the combat abilities, raw talent and connection with the EVA can't account for all of it."  
"真嗣，你完全有能力看到这一步，我想我们俩都心知肚明。" 冬月说道，将他剩下的银将推到金将前面，"同步率、战斗能力、天赋以及与 EVA 的连接，这些都无法解释全部。"

"When I first saw you in the medbay after your… incident… I knew something was off, how and why didn't matter then, but now I understand."  
"当我第一次在医疗室看到你，就在你……那次事故之后……我就感觉到有些不对劲，当时原因和方式并不重要，但现在我明白了。"

"I think you're mistaken." Shinji said, placing his captured rook at the far end of the board.  
"我想你搞错了。" 真嗣说道，将他的被俘车放在棋盘的远端。

"Am I?" the man asked as he advanced a pawn.  
"是吗？" 那人问道，随即推进了一个兵。

Shinji didn't answer, he simply took the man's knight while promoting the piece to a dragon king.  
真嗣没有回答，他只是吃掉了对方的马，同时将棋子晋升为龙王。

"Both your parents were like that, both hiding genius behind different facades…"  
"你的父母都是那样，都把天才隐藏在不同的外表之下……"

"DON'T," Shinji stopped, composing himself after the outburst, "compare me to them."  
"别，" 真嗣停顿了一下，爆发后努力平复自己，"别拿我和他们比。"

"Why not?" Fuyutsuki asked, his bishop taking Shinji's pawn in the center of the board, "Whatever your feelings for your father you must realize the man's talents, and your mother…"  
"为什么不呢？" 冬月问道，他的象棋中的象吃掉了真嗣的兵，位于棋盘中央，"无论你对父亲的感受如何，你必须认识到他的才能，还有你的母亲……"

"Cared more for her work than for her own son." Shinji said bitterly, while he moved his golden general.  
“她更关心工作，而不是自己的儿子。”真嗣苦涩地说道，同时移动了他的金色将军。

Fuyutsuki frowned, and pulled his bishop back, "She loved you very much, enough to be a part of this project… and to divert it."  
冬月皱起眉头，拉回了自己的主教，“她非常爱你，足以成为这个项目的一部分……并改变它。”

Shinji gritted his teeth, how could a man so blind survive as his father's right hand? Could he really think that Yui's plan was a good idea, that it was worth risking everything for it? Or was he just as blind as his father when it came to Yui Ayanami?  
真嗣咬紧牙关，一个如此盲目的人怎能成为他父亲的得力助手？他真的认为唯的计划是个好主意，值得为之冒险一切吗？还是说，在唯·绫波这件事上，他和他的父亲一样盲目？

Shinji moved pulled his dragon king back, preparing to wreak havoc along the man's lines. Why was he even entertaining the man with this game anymore?  
真嗣将他的龙王拉回，准备在对方的阵线上大肆破坏。他为何还要继续与这人玩这场游戏？

"If it's any consolation, your father doesn't want to entertain the idea of what you really are." Fuyutsuki said, placing a captured pawn on Shinji's flank.  
“如果这能让你好受些，你父亲并不想接受你真正的身份。”冬月说，将一枚被俘的兵放在真嗣的侧翼。

"I'm Shinji Ikari." Shinji repeated almost robotically, capturing the piece with his silver general.  
“我是碇真嗣。”真嗣机械地重复道，用他的银将吃掉了那枚棋子。

"Yes, but are you ours?" Fuyutsuki asked, moving his king.  
"是的，但你是属于我们的吗？" 冬月问道，移动了他的国王。

"What kind of question is that?"  
"这算什么问题？"

The man simply watched Shinji's move, and likely was judging his reaction to every word he said, "I've had ten years to ponder this, I even had time to investigate the MAGI's peculiar behavior when dealing with you. Would you like to know what I found?" Fuyutsuki asked, quickly making a move.  
那人只是观察着真嗣的举动，很可能是在评判他对每句话的反应，"我花了十年时间思考这个问题，甚至有时间调查 MAGI 在与你打交道时的异常行为。你想知道我发现了什么吗？" 冬月问道，迅速走了一步棋。

Shinji's hands clenched underneath the table, how the hell had this man found it? He barely register his move as put all effort into maintaining an emotionless face.  
新治的手在桌下紧握，这男人究竟是如何找到它的？他几乎没察觉到对方的动作，只是竭尽全力维持着一副无动于衷的表情。

"Over the years, buried in subroutines and deep within the code, I found protocols pertaining to you. Imagine my surprise when I found multiple backdoors and protocols all protecting you." Fuyutsuki smiled at the boy while not even looking at the board.  
多年来，埋藏在子程序和代码深处，我发现了与你相关的协议。当我发现多个后门和协议都在保护你时，你可以想象我的惊讶。Fuyutsuki 对着男孩微笑，甚至没有看向棋盘。

Now he knew this feeling, the feeling of being trapped, the feeling of…  
现在他明白了这种感觉，被困住的感觉，那种……

"And the most perplexing thing of all, none of this would matter if the MAGI themselves couldn't be convinced of their utility, these were not created by Dr. Akagi, nor her daughter before the MAGI's activating." Fuyutsuki explained, responding to Shinji's move, "and when I queried the MAGI they all agreed on the same response, to talk to you."  
“最令人困惑的是，如果 MAGI 本身不相信它们的实用性，这一切都无关紧要，这些并非由赤木博士或在她之前激活 MAGI 的她的女儿所创造。”冬月解释道，回应了真嗣的举动，“当我询问 MAGI 时，它们都给出了相同的回答，要和你谈谈。”

His father's right hand moved again and without truly registering it so did he, however that only caused a smile to grow on the man's face.  
他父亲的右手再次移动，而他未经真正意识到也跟着动了，但这只让那男人的脸上笑容更甚。

"Sennichite." He said. "平局。" 他说。

Shinji blinked, looking down at the board, before realizing what he had done, before sighing. "And if you were right? Then what? If I was exactly what you think I am, what would you do?"  
碇真嗣眨了眨眼，低头看着棋盘，随即意识到自己做了什么，叹了口气。“如果你说对了怎么办？那又如何？如果我正是你所认为的那样，你会怎么做？”

Fuyutsuki leaned forwards, his eyes seemingly seeing straight through him. "I want to know what it was like."  
冬月向前倾身，目光仿佛能直透人心。“我想知道那是什么样的感觉。”

"What?" “什么？”

"Instrumentality." He said, "your mother had her own plans, but I'm afraid the Near Third Impact ruined our chances. So, I want to know if it was worth it, did everything we did mean anything?"  
“人类补完计划。”他说道，“你母亲有自己的打算，但恐怕近第三次冲击毁了我们的机会。所以，我想知道这一切是否值得，我们所做的一切是否有意义？”

The man's mind wouldn't be changed, Shinji was convinced of that now. Perhaps there was only one thing left to do perhaps that was the best outcome for their conversation at this point, forcing a draw.  
那人的想法不会改变，真嗣现在确信了。或许只剩下一件事可做，也许这是他们此刻对话的最佳结果，迫使双方打成平手。

"If I'm here, what do you think?"  
"如果我在这里，你认为呢？"

"Her plans were never to stop it." Fuyutsuki admitted.  
"她的计划从未是要阻止它。" 冬月承认道。"

"I know." "我知道。"

"So what was it like, what did it feel like?"  
"那感觉如何，是什么样的感觉？"

Shinji just stood up, tiring of their conversation. Behind the man the same red-haired specter he had seen for so long stood, only this he could see her for what she was and the look she was giving him told him everything he needed to know.  
真嗣只是站了起来，厌倦了他们的对话。在男人身后，那个他已久见的红发幽灵依然站立着，只是这次他看清了她的真面目，她投来的目光告诉他一切他需要知道的事情。

"It felt numb." He said plainly, before turning and walking away, leaving the old man seated there, picking up the pieces.  
"感觉麻木。" 他平淡地说道，然后转身离开，留下老人独自坐在那里，拾起碎片。

***Looks at date… Yikes! *看了一眼日期……哎呀！**

**Sorry about the wait guys, between real life projects and work this took a while. The main issue was my flash drive that had all my EVA files on it shit the bed. That happened literally right after I opened up Ch 53, Ch 54 was only saved by some backups I made a few months ago, but I had worked on it since then meaning the last chapter isn't exactly how I wanted it. Either way that really killed my motivation, especially when it had all my side projects on it too, which means the longer Begin Again story is going to have to wait. The good news is I sent if off to get fixed which means I might get all my stuff back, cross your fingers.  
抱歉让大家久等了，现实生活中的项目和工作让我耽搁了不少时间。主要问题是我的闪存盘，里面存了我所有的 EVA 文件，结果它突然坏了。就在我打开第 53 章之后，第 54 章幸亏有几个月前的备份才得以保存，但我后来又对其进行了修改，所以最后的chapter并不完全是我想要的样子。这事儿真的打击了我的积极性，尤其是我的其他副项目也都在那个盘上，这意味着更长的‘重新开始’故事得推迟了。好消息是我已经送去修理，说不定能找回所有资料，大家祈祷一下吧。**

**Looks like the last chapter hit everyone in the feels which I exactly what I wanted to do, and I think you guys can see why I didn't want to have any author's notes on it, I really just wanted it to end succinctly.  
看来最后的chapter让大家都感同身受了，这正是我想要的效果，我想你们能理解为什么我不希望在上面加任何作者的话，我真的只想让它简洁地结束。**

**SHOUTOUTS! (oh man this is a lot!)  
致谢环节！（哦，天哪，这可真不少！）**

**Berix – They haven't got to talk YET. Yeah, I got a handful to titles saved for specific chapters lol.  
Berix – 他们还没来得及交谈呢。没错，我确实为特定章节保存了不少标题，哈哈。**

**YodaMorpheus7 – Yeah, it really was just off the hip move, which I felt was appropriate, 'A chance to fix this? Sign me up!' just like Shinji does in 3.0.  
YodaMorpheus7 – 是啊，那确实是个即兴之举，我觉得很合适，‘有机会修正这一切？算我一个！’就像真嗣在 3.0 中那样。**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – Just the past, nothing more. (2) Hurts don't it?  
美利坚的超斯宾克 – 只是过去，仅此而已。（2）很痛吧？**

**Guest (1) – We'll get there.  
访客（1） – 我们会到达那里的。**

**tomdj1701 – Maybe we'll get that talk? (2) Thanks!  
tomdj1701 – 也许我们会有那次谈话？（2）谢谢！**

**Top – Thanks! 顶部 - 谢谢！**

**FraktalAMT – Well, he didn't want to leave her did he?  
FraktalAMT – 嗯，他并不想离开她，对吧？**

**Guest (2) – I always come back.  
访客（2）——我总会回来的。**

**Guest (3) – I'm not.  
访客（3）——我不是。**

**ThyDevoutBeliever – It's all just memories.  
ThyDevoutBeliever ——一切都只是回忆。**

**Attila1987 – I think the main takeaway is that it was his choice. He went voluntarily, just like Shinji tries to fix the world in 3.0, but there's also the fact that maybe he did it in earnest, that people would have come back if he stayed. For me it's the choice of going and needing Asuka to come with him. (2) It was fun balancing both sides in 2.0 and it'll be fun to write those interactions, and maybe Soryu and Shikinami will meet face to face, hmm?  
Attila1987 – 我认为关键在于这是他的选择。他自愿前往，就像真嗣在 3.0 中试图拯救世界一样，但也有可能他是真心实意的，如果他留下，人们可能会回来。对我来说，选择离开并需要明日香与他同行是重点。(2) 在 2.0 中平衡双方很有趣，写这些互动也会很有趣，或许惣流和式波会面对面相遇，嗯？**

**EvaPilotFair – Thanks! (2) Re-Take REEEEEEE! JK, thanks man, I really enjoyed writing this chapter, and I think 2****nd** **person really helps deal with the 'recap' this chapter does. I doubt it would be as impactful if it was 3****rd** **person and 3x as long.**  
EvaPilotFair – 谢谢！(2) 重制版啊啊啊啊啊！开玩笑的，谢谢你，我真的很享受写这个chapter，而且我认为第二人称确实有助于处理这个chapter的'回顾'。如果用第三人称写，而且篇幅是三倍长，我怀疑不会有同样的影响力。

**Guest (4) – Yeah, there will only be one more Shikinami flashback, but other than that it's all in the present now.  
Guest (4) – 是的，只会再有一段式波的闪回，除此之外，现在都是当下的情节了。**

**engel17white – Not really sure how to gauge that reaction honestly.  
engel17white – 老实说，真不太确定该怎么解读那个反应。**

**KingXanaduu – Maybe we'll get that talk?  
KingXanaduu – 也许我们会有那个谈话？**

**Calborghete – Thanks! Calgorghete – 谢谢！**

**kempn200252 – Thanks! I looked up the video and there's a reason it's familiar. They're narrating excerpts from the Revenge of the Sith novel, which I've read and really enjoy, and its 2****nd** **person bits are what inspired this, so yeah you're technically dead on.**  
kempn200252 – 谢谢！我查看了那个视频，难怪觉得熟悉。他们在讲述《西斯的复仇》小说中的摘录，这本小说我读过并且非常喜欢，其中第二人称的叙述方式正是启发我创作的灵感来源，所以你说的没错，确实如此。

**Flar-the-Overlord – Because you love it haha.  
弗拉尔霸主——因为你爱它哈哈。**

**Guest (4) – It did what it was meant to.  
访客（4）——它完成了它的使命。**

**Guest (5) – Yeah, don't make deals with Gods Shinji! I doubt I could get this drawn, besides it's not even finished.  
访客（5）——是啊，慎二，别和神明做交易！我怀疑我能否画出来，再说这还没完成呢。**

**Guest (6) – It's more a companion piece to Chapter 53 honesty, I just wanted it alone.  
访客（6）——这更像是对《一千零一夜》第 53 章的补充，我只是想单独呈现它。**

**Guest (7) – 4ever (not) al0ne  
访客 (7) – 永远（不）孤单**

**Shredjeep777 – Thanks! That is what I enjoy too, that you can go back and reread every interaction and see it in a different light. As for Shinji's spiral, I doubt it would happen, if anything he'd just be angry at himself, cause why should he trust Kaworu?  
Shredjeep777 – 谢谢！我也很享受这一点，你可以反复阅读每一次互动，每次都能有新的理解。至于真嗣的螺旋式下降，我怀疑这不会发生，如果有什么的话，他只会对自己生气，因为他为什么要信任渚薰呢？**

**Metalora – Yes yes, and more yes.  
梅托罗拉 —— 是的，是的，更多是的。**

**Captain Toast – Oh boy, sorry for the wait, glad you're enjoying it though! The first 20-ish chapters are getting combed over slowly, as I hadn't really written anything in roughly 2 years so it's pretty rough.  
吐司队长 – 哦，天哪，抱歉让你久等了，很高兴你喜欢！前 20 章左右正在慢慢梳理，因为我大约两年没写过东西了，所以相当粗糙。**

**JDH1080 – Thanks you so much, though I do think Once More With a Feeling has better writing, I will be finishing this lol.  
JDH1080 – 非常感谢，虽然我觉得《Once More With a Feeling》的文笔更好，但我还是会完成这个故事的，哈哈。**

**AsukaLangley02014 – Thanks! Looks like I did what I was trying to do. It is worrying for them, but we'll find out when we get there.  
AsukaLangley02014 – 谢谢！看来我成功达到了目的。这对他们来说确实令人担忧，但我们到时候就会知道了。**

**Skyfox – It is painful, I wanted a simple post-EoE for that exact reason, and the idea that maybe he could have waited, if only he had waited, each day was a new chance for people to come back. Like Lilith said they SHOULD have come back and I agree that they would too. Glad its hitting you in all the right places and as for everyone getting a happy ending? We'll just have to find out.  
天狐——这确实令人痛心，我本希望有一个简单的 EoE 后记，正是出于这个原因。或许他本可以等待，只要他再等一等，每一天都是人们回归的新机会。正如莉莉丝所说，他们本应回来，我也相信他们会回来。很高兴这触动了你所有正确的地方，至于每个人是否都能得到幸福的结局？我们只能拭目以待。**

**TheHiddenLettuce – This was started before 4.0 came out so Mari was kinda a blank slate, don't know what I'd do with her if I knew what we know after 4.0 though.  
TheHiddenLettuce – 这篇文是在 4.0 版本发布前开始的，所以玛丽基本上是个空白画布，如果我知道 4.0 之后的情况，真不知道该怎么处理她。**

**I'm going to shoot for finishing 3.0 by the end of August, hopefully we make that deadline.  
我计划在八月底前完成 3.0 版本，希望我们能赶上这个截止日期。**

**Until Next Time 下次再见**


### Chapter 56: "…The red blood hearts…"  
Chapter 56: "…那鲜红的血之心…"

She wanted to sleep, more than anything she just wanted to close her eyes and let the warm LCL wrap her in a warm embrace. If only she still loved its taste and artificial warmth.  
她只想睡觉，比任何时候都更想闭上眼睛，让温暖的 LCL 将她紧紧包裹。要是她还能爱上那味道和人工的温暖就好了。

"Princess!" the high-pitched voice cried over their comms.  
"公主！" 尖锐的声音在他们通讯中响起。

Sleep wouldn't be coming anytime soon.  
睡眠暂时不会降临。

Asuka rubbed her eye as and sighed at the prospect of listening to Mari's voice shriek in her cockpit. "If you don't have anything to report Four-Eyes get off the comms."  
明日香揉了揉眼睛，对着即将听到真希波在驾驶舱中尖叫的前景叹了口气。"如果你没什么要报告的，四眼，就别占着通讯频道。"

"How can you be in such a bad mood in a tropical paradise like this?" Mari scoffed.  
“在这种热带天堂般的地方，你怎么能心情这么差？”玛丽嗤之以鼻。

Asuka could barely muster a snort. Tropical Paradise? Sure it had been at one point, before nuclear testing and the two near-world-ending impacts. The water was no longer a crystal blue, nor were there any islands to speak of, all that had been left from the rising sea levels was a set of sonar contacts from the sunken ships in the former lagoon, enough to confirm where you were.  
明日香几乎只能发出一声冷哼。热带天堂？确实，曾经是，但在核试验和两次几乎毁灭世界的撞击之后，水域已不再是晶莹剔透的蓝色，岛屿也荡然无存。海平面上升后，留下的只有前礁湖中沉船的声纳信号，足以确认你的位置。

Unit-02 sat on one wing of the Wunder, watching as half a dozen supply ships had their cargo transferred to the ship by Cold War helicopters. She was sure the few VTOL aircraft they still had, were sitting idly onboard, the risk and possible maintenance of the machines was not something WILLE could afford. The 'Magic Carpets' as the mechanics called them were reserved for more important, albeit boring, things these days.  
二号机坐在飞船“奇迹”的一侧机翼上，看着半打补给船的货物被冷战时期的直升机转运到船上。她确信他们仅存的几架垂直起降飞机正闲置在船上，WILLE 无法承担这些机器的风险和可能的维护费用。那些机械师们称之为“魔毯”的飞机，如今只保留给更重要但乏味的事务。

"There's nothing out here," Asuka grumbled, willing her Unit-02 up to go recharge her Eva.  
"这里什么都没有，" 明日香咕哝着，催促她的二号机去充电。

"But couldn't you just jump into that water right now?" Mari asked.  
"但你现在不能直接跳进水里吗？" 真希波问道。

Asuka grumbled something unpleasant under her breath, before climbing over the ship to find Unit-08. Out of the back of the torso where the charging outlet should be, a cable extended, leading to the large positron rifle resting in Unit-08s arms.  
明日香低声抱怨了几句，然后爬过船去找八号机。从背部本应是充电口的地方，一根电缆延伸出来，连接到八号机手臂上架着的大型阳电子步枪。

Unplugging the weapon, Asuka brought the cord to Unit-02s back, plugging it in. She watched her energy meter turn to green as it charged, even with the leaps and bounds in battery technology she still was limited, and the efforts to install an N2 engine in her own Eva had failed.  
拔下武器，明日香将线缆接到二号机的背部，插好。她看着能量表转为绿色，开始充电，尽管电池技术有了长足进步，她仍受限于此，而尝试在自己的 Eva 中安装 N2 引擎的努力也以失败告终。

"How nice of you to come sit with me!" Mari said, sitting down on the wing, "You know what? This reminds me of when we met again, you remember right?"  
“你能来陪我真是太好了！”真希波说着，坐在了机翼上，“你知道吗？这让我想起了我们重逢的那一刻，你还记得吧？”

Asuka grimaced, why would she want to remember?  
明日香皱了皱眉，她为何要记得这些？

ʡʘʘʘʢ

"_Princess is that you!?"_ "公主是你吗！？"

_Asuka hissed in pain as someone slammed into her back with a complete disregard for the traces of LCL still covering her. If there was one thing she hated about the physical therapy the good doctor was putting her through, it was the soreness afterward. Sure she was used to training, that's all they did when she was being selected as a pilot, but this was a different type, a deeper, lingering soreness.  
明日香痛得倒吸一口凉气，有人完全不顾她身上还残留着 LCL 液体，猛地撞上了她的后背。如果说她对那位好医生安排的物理治疗有什么不满的话，那就是治疗后的酸痛感。当然，她习惯了训练，在被选为驾驶员时，他们做的就是这些，但这种酸痛是不同类型的，更深沉，更持久。_

_And it only hurt more when someone crashed into you.  
而且当有人撞到你时，疼痛只会加剧。_

"_What the hell do you think you're doing?" Asuka shouted, shaking whoever it was off and turning around._  
“你到底在搞什么鬼？”明日香大喊着，甩开那人并转过身来。

_The first thing that stood out was the pink. It was almost blinding after having to see the same old grey ship interior every day. Then there was the realization it was a plugsuit, the girl was another pilot.  
首先映入眼帘的是那抹粉色。在日复一日面对着单调灰暗的舰内装潢后，这颜色几乎刺眼。随即意识到这是一件驾驶服，那女孩也是一名驾驶员。_

_That meant competition. 这意味着竞争。_

_Had she been chosen to take her job? Both her legs worked fine, Misato wouldn't replace her right? Had she been using Unit-02? Had she even touched Unit-02?!  
她是否被选中取代自己的位置？她的双腿完好无损，美里不会替换她的，对吧？她是否使用过二号机？她甚至触碰过二号机吗？！_

"_You're glaring Princess," the girl said in an all-too cheerful voice, "What did I tell you about that face?"_  
"你这是在瞪人呢，公主，"女孩用过于欢快的声音说道，"我跟你说过多少次了，别摆那副脸？"

_What did she tell her? Asuka raised an eyebrow now more confused than annoyed, "Who are you again?"  
她到底跟她说了什么？明日香挑起眉毛，现在更多的是困惑而非恼怒，"你又是谁来着？"_

_The girl's jaw fell open and her figure slumped before she pushed up the glasses resting on her nose. "Don't tell me you don't recognize me Princess!" she moaned.  
女孩的下巴张开，身形一垮，随即推了推架在鼻梁上的眼镜。"别告诉我你认不出我，公主！"她哀叹道。_

_Asuka just shrugged, looking at her face again.  
明日香只是耸了耸肩，再次看向她的脸。_

"_Oh, how about, 'No one remembers Number Two'." The girl said, seemingly trying to mimic the Second Child's voice._  
"哦，比如说，'没人记得第二名'。" 女孩说道，似乎在试图模仿二号机驾驶员的语气。

_Asuka squinted, peering over her face before it all clicked. "Four-Eyes?" she breathed in disbelief.  
明日香眯起眼睛，仔细打量着对方，直到一切豁然开朗。“四眼仔？”她难以置信地轻声说道。_

"_YES!" the girl known as Mari Illustrious shouted, launching at her for another hug, but Asuka just backed away._  
“太好了！”被称为玛丽·伊丽莎白的女孩子大喊着，向她扑去想要再来一个拥抱，但明日香只是向后退了一步。

"_But… how… wha…" Asuka couldn't understand it, she could barely process it, the girl in front of her was so radically different from the one she knew all those years ago, and yet she was so very much the same._  
“但是……怎么……什么……”明日香无法理解，她几乎无法处理这一切，眼前的女孩与多年前她所认识的那个人截然不同，然而却又如此相似。

"_C'mon, I'll explain everything!" Mari said, her smile somehow growing larger. Asuka didn't trust the building excitement on the girl's face and that distrust was only exemplified by the tug on her arm as she followed the girl through the corridors._  
“来吧，我会解释一切的！”玛丽说道，她的笑容似乎变得更加灿烂。明日香对女孩脸上逐渐增长的兴奋感到不信任，这种不信任在她被拉着穿过走廊时更加明显。

_Eventually, they reached the hangars below the flight deck, which was filled with all sorts of commotion. Men ran everywhere with ordinance, storing aircraft, and moving supplies with powerlifters. Asuka had only ever explored the place once and found herself nearly run over by a mechanic who hadn't bothered to check behind him as he moved tons of cargo. Her leg had hurt for two days afterward, due to her willing herself to move fast enough and she never felt the need to go in there again.  
最终，他们来到了飞行甲板下方的机库，那里充斥着各种喧嚣。人们带着弹药四处奔忙，储存飞机，用动力提升机搬运物资。明日香只探索过这个地方一次，差点被一个没注意身后就移动着数吨货物的车间工人撞倒。她的腿因为强迫自己快速移动而疼了两天，之后她再也没有进去过那里。_

"_What's it been, five years?" Asuka asked as they reached a less busy side of the hangar._  
“这有多久了，五年了吗？”当他们到达机库较为安静的一侧时，明日香问道。

"_Almost ten if you count the years since the Near Third Impact," Mari said, pushing up her glasses as she sat down, motioning Asuka to do the same. The supply crate that was currently serving as their bench wasn't all that comfortable, but it was good enough, especially to rest._  
“如果算上近第三次冲击后的这些年，差不多十年了。”真希波说着，推了推眼镜，坐了下来，示意明日香也坐下。他们现在坐的供应箱作为长凳并不太舒适，但足够好了，尤其是用来休息。

_Asuka nodded, "So they got you to pilot while I was asleep?" she asked curiously.  
明日香点头道：“所以他们趁我睡着时让你来驾驶？”她好奇地问。_

"_Nope!" Mari said, bringing a pink finger up to her chin, "They couldn't pass up on the number 2 pilot from our program! The IPEA scooped me up after you beat me out."_  
“没有啦！”真希波说，将一根粉红色的手指放在下巴上，“他们可舍不得放过我们项目里的二号飞行员！在你击败我之后，IPEA 就把我招揽了。”

"_So what exactly are you doing here?"_  
“那你到底在这里做什么呢？”

"_I've been with WILLE since N3I, I was there that day," Mari said. Asuka watched as the girl put her hands behind her head and leaned back, using a second crate where they were seated to elicit a series of loud pops from her back and earning a look of contentment on her face._  
"我从 N3I 开始就加入了 WILLE，那天我也在场，" 玛丽说道。明日香看着女孩将双手放在脑后，向后靠去，利用他们坐着的第二个板条箱让她的背部发出一连串响亮的噼啪声，脸上露出了满足的表情。

"_You were in Tokyo-03?" Asuka asked, suddenly more intrigued._  
"你在东京-03？" 明日香突然更加感兴趣地问道。

"_Yep, I even got to pilot Unit-02 against the Tenth Angel." She said, her smile falling. "For what it's worth Princess, I don't know if either of us could have done anything."_  
"是的，我甚至有机会驾驶二号机对抗第十使徒。" 她说道，笑容消失了。"公主，不管怎么说，我不知道我们俩是否能做些什么。"

_The Second Child said nothing for a moment and Mari was more than willing to let her take her time until she spoke again.  
第二子沉默了一会儿，玛丽非常愿意让她慢慢来，直到她再次开口。_

"_I should have been there."_  
“我本该在那里的。”

"_Princess…"_ “公主……”

"_Don't call me that!" Asuka barked, though it was lost in the noise of the busy hangar, "I should have been there with_ him."  
"别那么叫我！" 明日香厉声道，但她的声音淹没在繁忙机库的嘈杂中，"我本该和他在一起的。"

_Mari stayed quiet, and Asuka could feel her eyes boring into her back, but she didn't want to say more, she didn't need to say more. If she had been there, this would have never happened. If she hadn't agreed to test Unit-03. If she hadn't been sidelined.  
真希波保持沉默，明日香能感觉到她的目光穿透了自己的后背，但她不想再多说什么，也不需要再多说什么。如果她在那里，这一切就不会发生。如果她没有同意测试三号机。如果她没有被边缘化。_

_If. 如果。_

"_He really wasn't that nice." Mari chimed up._  
"他真的没那么好。" 玛丽插话道。

"_Excuse me?" Asuka gritted her teeth. Shinji Ikari was anything but. He proved that to her with every measure of kindness._  
"你说什么？" 明日香咬牙切齿。碇真嗣绝非如此。他用每一次的善意向她证明了这一点。

"_Hey don't get mad at the messenger," she said defensively, "I kinda ran into him when I got into Tokyo-03."_  
"嘿，别怪传话的人，" 她辩解道，"我刚到东京-03 时碰巧遇到了他。"

_Asuka let the girl continue, intrigued now.  
明日香让女孩继续说下去，现在她被勾起了兴趣。_

"_I kinda landed on him, I was supposed to sneak in without NERV knowing, but I guess I blew that right? After that, he maybe threatened me?" She said sliding away slightly from what she thought would be an exploding Shikinami._  
“我好像是摔在他身上的，本来计划是偷偷溜进去不让 NERV 发现，但看来我搞砸了，对吧？之后，他可能还威胁了我？”她边说边稍微挪开了一点，以为眼前的式波会爆炸。

_But the explosion never came, just a question.  
但爆炸并未发生，只有一句问话。_

"_When?"_ “什么时候？”

"_Hmmm, maybe a week or so before Unit-03's test?"_  
“嗯，大概在三号机测试前一周左右？”

"_He never told me," Asuka whispered to herself._  
“他从未告诉我，”明日香轻声自语。

_This was just one more thing, one more example of the boy she knew acting completely devoid of how she had known him. Had she been blind to it? Had she simply overlooked it? Which was the real Shinji? The one he had shown her, or the one he had shown everyone else?  
这只是又一个例子，又一个她所认识的男孩表现得完全不符合她对他的了解的例子。是她一直视而不见吗？还是她只是忽略了这一点？哪个才是真正的真嗣？是他对她展示的那一面，还是他对所有人展示的那一面？_

_Had she ever really known him?  
她真的了解过他吗？_

"_They're repairing Unit-02 you know," Mari spoke up, trying to revitalize the girl._  
"他们在修复二号机，你知道的，" 真希波开口说道，试图让女孩振作起来。

_Asuka snapped around, "What?"  
明日香猛地转过身，"什么？"_

_Mari smiled, knowing she had said the right thing to tear her away from that useless line of thinking. "Unit-02 is going to be operational again soon."  
真希波笑了，知道自己说对了话，把她从那无用的思绪中拉了出来。"二号机很快就能重新投入使用了。"_

_With those words, Asuka felt the world slow to a crawl. This past year she had felt so naked, so bare, and exposed to the world taking one beating after another with no way to defend herself. There was no Evangelion to shield her and the fleeting comfort she had felt from Shinji had long since evaporated.  
随着这些话，明日香感到世界仿佛慢了下来。过去的一年里，她感觉自己如此赤裸、如此脆弱，一次次地遭受打击，却无法自卫。没有 EVA 来保护她，而她从真嗣那里感受到的短暂安慰也早已消散。_

_If she had Unit-02, it would all be alright again. All she had to do was get herself back in the entry plug and her world would make sense again.  
如果她有二号机，一切都会再次好起来。她只需要回到插入栓里，她的世界就会再次变得有意义。_

"_Here," Mari grabbed her arm, jolting her from her thoughts, "c'mon up to the flight deck!"_  
“这里，”玛丽抓住她的手臂，将她从思绪中拉回，“快上来，到飞行甲板去！”

_The girl dragged Asuka to the flight elevator, ignoring the shouts from the crew and sitting on cargo crates being sent up. As soon as they crested the flight deck, Asuka's eye shot wide open.  
女孩拽着明日香走向飞行电梯，无视了船员的呼喊，坐在正被运送上去的货物箱上。一到达飞行甲板，明日香的眼睛立刻瞪得大大的。_

_Crouched there, a familiar figure of an Evangelion towered above her. Its green and red armor was foreign to her, and so was the nuances of the design. The technical information she had spent so many years studying failed her as she hobbled around it, looking at this new generation of man's ultimate fighting instrument. Somehow, it felt as if she was seeing it for the first time.  
在那里蹲着，一尊熟悉的 EVA 身影耸立在她面前。其绿色和红色的装甲对她来说是陌生的，设计上的细微差别也是如此。她多年来钻研的技术资料在这一刻失效了，她蹒跚地绕着它转，审视着这个新一代人类终极战斗工具。不知为何，感觉就像她第一次见到它一样。_

"_Whatcha think? Pretty cool right?" Mari said, patting the armor, "Positron rifles have come a long way since the Sixth Angel too." She said, pointing to the massive weapon sitting beside it, a cable running up the outlet it would normally have been charged from._  
“你觉得怎么样？很酷吧？”真希波拍了拍装甲说道，“阳电子步枪自第六使徒以来也进步了不少。”她指着旁边那把巨大的武器说，那武器旁边有一根电缆连接到它通常充电的插座。

_Asuka brought her hand up to the cool metal and a sense of nostalgia ran through her. She was back in Germany, seeing and touching an Eva for the first time.  
明日香将手伸向冰冷的金属，一股怀旧之情涌上心头。她回到了德国，第一次见到并触摸到 Eva。_

"_Asuka?"_ “明日香？”

_Asuka frowned, removing her hand, "Where's Unit-02?" she asked.  
明日香皱起眉头，移开手，问道：“二号机在哪里？”_

_Mari smiled, "It's gonna be transported here tomorrow! They'll be repairing it in the new base!"  
真希波微笑着说：“明天就会运到这里！他们会在新基地进行修复！”_

"_What base?"_ “什么基地？”

_Mari cocked her head, "Really? They didn't tell you?"  
玛丽歪了歪头，“真的？他们没告诉你？”_

"_They don't tell me much of anything anymore," Asuka said, her eye looking away._  
“他们现在什么都不怎么告诉我了，”明日香说道，目光移向别处。

_Mari huffed and simply grabbed her arm spinning her to look out over the ocean, eliciting a barely audible gasp from the redhead.  
玛丽哼了一声，直接抓住她的手臂，将她转过去面向大海，让红发女孩发出几乎听不见的惊呼。_

_Heading towards them was a small fleet of ships, carriers, battleships, cruisers, and at the center a massive hulk of a ship.  
朝他们驶来的是一支小型舰队，包括航空母舰、战列舰、巡洋舰，而在中央是一艘巨大的船体。_

"_Once it's complete, we'll be unstoppable!" Mari said triumphantly._  
“一旦完成，我们将所向披靡！”玛丽得意地说道。

"_What's it called?" Asuka asked, unimpressed._  
"这东西叫什么？" 明日香问道，显得不以为意。

"_We don't have a name yet, but I already scratched out the nameplate!" the girl replied, "Wunder! Fitting right?"_  
"我们还没起名字呢，但我已经把名牌划掉了！" 女孩回答，"Wunder！很合适吧？"

_Asuka rolled her eyes, "And just what…" The girl's words were interrupted by the wind-up of sirens blaring. Both their heads snapped around trying to look for the source of the alarm when an explosion rocked the ship.  
明日香翻了个白眼，"然后到底……" 女孩的话被刺耳的警报声打断。两人猛地转头，试图寻找警报的来源，就在这时，船体发生了爆炸。_

"Status?" Misato asked as she examined the grouping fleet of ships while sipping on the warm tea prepared by her subordinate. The ships seemed laughably small compared to the sheer mass that was Wunder.  
“情况如何？”美里一边啜饮着部下准备的温热茶水，一边审视着集结的舰队。与庞大的 Wunder 相比，这些舰船显得颇为渺小，甚至有些滑稽。

"Cargo transfer should be complete in approximately an hour," Midorianswered.  
“货物转移大约一小时后完成，”米多里安回答道。

Misato nodded, taking another sip of her tea. Waiting was the worse part of this, despite Wunder she felt vulnerable just sitting here.  
Misato 点了点头，又啜了一口茶。等待是这一切中最糟糕的部分，尽管有 Wunder，她仍觉得自己坐在这里很脆弱。

"Captain?" “舰长？”

The woman turned, seeing Ritsuko standing there, a data pad and evidence bag in her hands.  
女子转过身，看到律子站在那里，手里拿着数据板和证据袋。

"Can I speak with you alone?"  
“我能和您单独谈谈吗？”

Misato frowned, just what she needed, one more thing. "Stay on station," she said to the bridge crew, receiving a flurry of acknowledgments in return as she followed Ritsuko.  
美里皱了皱眉，真是雪上加霜。“保持岗位，”她对舰桥人员说道，随即收到一片应答声，她跟着律子离开了。

Now outside the bridge, Ritsuko handed her the datapad, which had the frozen image of Shinji Ikari alone in the interrogation room.  
现在站在舰桥外，律子递给她一个数据板，上面冻结着真嗣·碇独自在审讯室的画面。

"here's the footage you requested," Ritsuko said before turning her attention to the clear evidence bag. "This was also in Unit-01. It's just been cleaned and cleared, but it doesn't work. I didn't really know what to do with it."  
“这是你要的录像，”律子说着，将注意力转向一个透明的证据袋。“这也是在零号机里发现的。已经清洗干净并检查过了，但无法运作。我不太清楚该怎么处理它。”

Misato just nodded taking the bag and dismissing the doctor. Pressing play on the tablet, she watched the footage of Shinji talking to nothing in the interrogation room, the audio not giving him the greatest endorsement.  
美里只是点点头，接过袋子并打发走了医生。她按下平板上的播放键，观看真嗣在审讯室里对着空气说话的录像，音频并没有给他最好的支持。

"_Ayanami? You can see her too?"_  
“绫波？你也能看见她吗？”

"_What's the last thing you remember?"_  
“你记得的最后一件事是什么？”

"_Well, welcome to the party, hope you enjoy the stay,"_  
"那么，欢迎来到派对，希望你玩得愉快，"

"_What was that?"_  "那是什么？"

"_How do you know that?"_  
"你怎么知道的？"

As Misato watched the footage, again and again, trying to unravel the enigma that was Shinji Ikari. All the while the SDAT player was resting on a ledge next to her, still sealed in its bag.  
当美里一遍又一遍地观看录像，试图解开真嗣·碇这个谜团时，SDAT 播放器静静地躺在她旁边的架子上，依旧封装在袋子里。

ʡʘʘʘʢ

"_It's finally here."_ "终于来了。"

_On the deck of the_ Over the Rainbow _Misato, ignored the wind whipping at her clothes as she held the binoculars through which she could see the hulking mass cresting the horizon. On the deck, the figure of Evangelion Unit-08 was being lowered by support craft, and crews were already readying the equipment needed for maintenance around it._  
在‘彩虹之上美里号’的甲板上，她无视着风扯动衣物的呼啸，手持望远镜，透过镜片能看见那庞大的身影正从地平线上升起。甲板上，福音战士 8 号机的轮廓正被支援艇缓缓放下，周围的工作人员也已准备好所需的维护设备。

_Lowering the optic, she felt a wave of relief fall over her, they had made it, and for once she felt as if something good had happened.  
放下望远镜，她感到一阵释然涌上心头，他们做到了，这一次她真切地感受到好事发生了。_

"_They'll be sending someone ahead of them, he's the one who made the N2 reactors viable," Ritsuko shouted from behind her as a helicopter broke off the group and prepared to land._  
"他们会派人先过来，就是他让 N2 反应堆变得可行，" 律子在直升机从队伍中脱离并准备降落时，从她身后喊道。

"_Hmm," Misato was not all that impressed, "and why exactly is he going to be helping us with retrofitting that thing?"_  
"嗯，" 美里并不怎么感兴趣，"他究竟为什么要帮我们改装那东西？"

"_Because we'll need all the power delivery we can get if we want to use it, it's going to take years at this point."_  
"因为如果我们想使用它，就需要尽可能多的能量供应，照现在的情况看，这得花上好几年。"

"_We don't have years," Misato grumbled to herself as the helicopter landed. She watched as the blades began to slow, and the pilot signaled to the deck crew it was ok to approach._  
"我们没有那么多时间," 美里咕哝着，直升机降落了。她看着旋翼开始减速，飞行员向甲板人员示意可以靠近。

_Misato walked up the helicopter, ignoring protests from Ritsuko, and was nearly to the door when it opened and a familiar face appeared.  
美里走向直升机，无视了律子的抗议，就在她快要到达门口时，门开了，一张熟悉的面孔出现了。_

"_It's been a long time Misato!"_  
"好久不见了，美里！"

_The woman stopped confounded by what she was seeing and hearing. While the blades slowed down, it was much easier to hear, and quite frankly she was going to need to hear the explanation for this one.  
女子因所见所闻而愣住。随着刀刃减速，听清变得容易多了，坦白说，她迫切需要一个解释来弄明白这一切。_

_Because Kensuke Aida was right there in front of her.  
因为真希波·明日香·兰格雷就站在她面前。_

_Behind him, he was followed by a team that immediately became unloading crates of equipment as he walked up to her, extending out his hand, which she instinctively grasped.  
他身后跟着一队人马，他一走近她，他们立刻开始卸下成箱的设备。他伸出手，她本能地握住了。_

"_What's it been? Five years?" he asked, a large smile on his face._  
“有多久了？五年？”他问道，脸上挂着大大的笑容。

_He was much different from how he remembered him, the last time she had seen his face he was a scared 14-year-old boy, a face in a seemingly endless sea of people escaping Tokyo-03 after the N3i. Now a man stood in front of her, taller than her and with a face that hadn't seen a razor for a few days.  
他与她记忆中的模样大相径庭，上次见到他的脸时，他还是个惊恐的 14 岁少年，在逃离东京-03 的人群中毫不起眼，那时 N3i 事件刚刚发生。如今站在她面前的，是个比她高大的男人，脸上已有几天未刮的胡茬。_

"_Kensuke Aida…" Misato said, releasing the handshake, "I can't say I thought I'd ever see you again."_  
"相田健介……"美里松开手，说道，"真没想到还能再见到你。"

_The man laughed, "I can say the same thing."  
男人笑道：“我也可以这么说。”_

_They walked away from the helicopter along the flight deck, his eyes snapping to the towering figure of Unit-08. "I never thought I'd make it to working on them." He said, pushing his glasses up his nose. Misato couldn't help but allow the memory of the young boy who was in awe of the Evangelion, the boy that followed_ him _around NERV, doing his best to capture a glimpse of what they thought was humanity's salvation._  
他们沿着飞行甲板远离直升机，他的目光紧锁在高大威猛的 Unit-08 上。“我从没想过自己能参与它们的研发。”他说着，推了推鼻梁上的眼镜。美里忍不住回想起那个对福音战士充满敬畏的少年，那个在 NERV 里跟着他转悠，竭力想一窥人类救赎之物的男孩。

_Maybe they were all Kensuke Aida at one point.  
或许他们每个人都曾是那个时期的肯斯克·相田。_

"_So you're the N2 Reactor expert?" Misato asked, breaking from the train of thought._  
"这么说，你就是 N2 反应堆的专家了？" 美里问道，打断了思绪。

"_Oh, I wouldn't call myself an expert," he said, rubbing the back of his neck, "I helped with some of the design, but it was mainly just optimization, besides this was a special request."_  
"哦，我可不敢自称专家，" 他揉了揉后颈，"我参与了一些设计工作，主要是优化，而且这次是个特别请求。"

"_Really?"_ "真的吗？"

"_Yeah, I've been in Village 3 for a few years now, between keeping an eye on NERV activity and trying to find new ways of reversing c__orization__, I've been pretty busy." He explained as they walked._  
"是啊，我在第三村已经待了几年了，既要盯着 NERV 的动向，又得寻找逆转核心化的方法，一直挺忙的。" 他边走边解释道。

"_So why are you here?" Misato asked, politely, yet annoyed that they had been sent someone… less qualified._  
"那你为什么来这里？" 美里问道，礼貌中带着一丝不悦，他们被派来了一个……不那么称职的人。

"_Frankly, because I'm expendable." The man shrugged, "The real brains are back in North America, but I know enough to give them the information they need to help."_  
"坦白说，因为我是个可有可无的角色。" 那人耸耸肩，"真正有才智的人都在北美，但我懂得足够多，能给他们提供所需的信息来帮忙。"

"_And you're ok with that?" Ritsuko spoke up from behind them, "Being considered 'expendable'?"_  
"你能接受这样吗？" 律子从他们身后插话，"被视为'可牺牲的'？"

_Kensuke laughed, "I live with the constant possibility of being wiped out by NERV or the sealing pillars failing, it's not too different if I'm here or there."  
健介笑了笑，“我生活在 NERV 或封印柱随时可能失效的威胁下，无论在这里还是那里，情况都差不多。”_

_The group became quiet for a moment before Misato turned to the man, only to find no one, she turned around, seeing him frozen and looking towards the base of Unit-08. Misato followed his gaze and it was instantly apparent what had caused him to stop.  
一时间，众人陷入了沉默。随后，美里转向那人，却发现空无一人。她转过身，看到他僵立着，目光投向 08 号机体的底部。美里顺着他的视线望去，立刻明白了是什么让他停下了脚步。_

_At the base of the Evangelion stood Asuka, examining it, with their other pilot chatting insensately to her.  
在福音战士的底部，明日香正在仔细检查，而他们的另一位驾驶员则喋喋不休地与她交谈着。_

"_Everything alright?" Misato asked, walking back to him._  
"一切都好吗？" 美里走回他身边问道。

"_She… looks like she hasn't aged a day," Kensuke said disbelievingly._  
"她……看起来好像一天都没老过，" 健介难以置信地说。

"_The phenomenon was coined as the 'Curse of the EVA'," Ritsuko said, "both pilots haven't aged for some time."_  
"这种现象被称为'EVA 的诅咒'，" 律子说，"两位驾驶员已经有一段时间没有变老了。"

"_How did you know she was here?" Misato asked, ignoring Ritsuko._  
“你怎么知道她在这里？”美里问道，忽略了律子。

"_It was in the briefing." Kensuke said swallowing, "Unit-02 was going to be repaired because you had a pilot for it again." Misato watched him look her up and down, "How bad is…."_  
“简报里说的。”真希波咽了咽口水，“2 号机要进行维修，因为你又给它找了个驾驶员。”美里看着他上下打量自己，“情况有多糟……”

_He was interrupted by the whining of sirens beginning to blare, instantly, Misato and Ritsuko took off running for the bridge, joining the rest of the crew who ran to their battle stations. Kensuke was pushed to the back of her mind, but she figured the man would find his way to a safe place. Only as she reached the flight deck's tower did an explosion rock the ship.  
警报的哀鸣突然响起，打断了他的话，美里和律子立刻冲向舰桥，与其他船员一起奔向各自的战斗岗位。真希波被她抛诸脑后，但她猜想那人会找到安全的地方。直到她抵达飞行甲板的塔台时，船体才被一次爆炸震撼。_

_The two women rushed up to the bridge, throwing on headsets and shouting questions and commands. Misato rushed to the radar operator, whose screen was lit up with radar contacts coming from the west.  
两位女士急忙冲上舰桥，戴上耳机，大声询问和下达指令。美里冲向雷达操作员，只见他的屏幕上闪烁着来自西方的雷达接触信号。_

"_I want every anti-air asset up now!" she shouted, as the crew relayed the message throughout the fleet, "and get me a damage report!"_  
“我要所有防空单位立即启动！”她喊道，船员们将消息传遍整个舰队，“并给我一份损坏报告！”

_Misato brought up her binoculars to scan for the contacts herself, following the missile trails that soon were launched from every able ship.  
Misato 举起她的双筒望远镜，亲自扫描那些目标，紧随着不久后从每艘可用舰船上发射的导弹轨迹。_

"_Unit-08 up and reporting for duty!" a distinct voice said through her headset._  
"初号机八号启动，报告任务状态！" 一个清晰的声音通过她的耳机传来。

"_Mari?"_  "麻里？"

"_Who else?" she answered back._  
"还能有谁？" 她回答道。

"_I want you facing west, start finding targets and taking them down!"_  
"我要你面向西边，开始寻找目标并击倒他们！"

"_Roger that!" Misato looked out the bridge to see Unit-08 readying its weapon. The mismatched Unit, knelt down and brought the rifle up to its head. The 'face' multitude of 'eyes' suddenly opened like a flower peddle, revealing one large lens, which extended out._  
"收到！" 美里望向桥外，看到 8 号机正准备武器。这台不协调的机体跪下，将步枪举至头部。那张由众多'眼睛'组成的'脸'突然像花瓣一样张开，露出一个巨大的镜头，镜头随之伸出。

"_Firing!" Mari's voice rang through the bridge, as a powerful blast shook the ship. Misato leaned down the radar screen and smiled to herself as a cluster of radar contacts vanished._  
“开火！”玛丽的喊声响彻舰桥，随着一道强力冲击波撼动船身。美里俯身查看雷达屏幕，暗自微笑，只见一簇雷达信号瞬间消失。

"_reloading!"_ "重新装填！"

_Misato felt herself calming, the situation would be fine, they…  
美里感到自己逐渐平静下来，情况会好转的，他们……_

"_New radar contacts to the south! Closing!"_  
"南部新雷达接触！正在接近！"

_Misato's eyes widened at the screen, how had they not seen them?  
美里盯着屏幕，眼睛瞪得大大的，他们怎么就没发现呢？_

"_contact in three… two…"_ "三秒后接触…两秒…"

"_Brace for impact!" Misato shouted as they waited for explosions that never came. Instead, they felt the impacts of multiple… something. At first, Misato didn't know what to think. There was no explosion and it didn't feel like kinetic ordinance. It felt more like something scrapping the hull._  
"准备撞击！" 美里大喊，他们等待着爆炸声，却始终没有到来。取而代之的是，他们感受到了多次…某种东西的撞击。起初，美里不知该如何思考。没有爆炸声，也不像是动能武器。感觉更像是有什么东西在刮擦船体。

"_Is everyone alright?" Misato called out, receiving a round of mild confirmations._  
"大家都还好吗？" 美里喊道，得到了一阵轻微的确认声。

"_What was…" Ritsuko was cut off by a crew member._  
"那是什么…" 律子被一名船员打断了。

"_We have breaches on decks one through four!"_  
"一到四层甲板出现破损！"

"_Damage report."_ "损害报告。"

"_Systems functional, they weren't trying to cripple the ship."_  
"系统正常，他们并非试图瘫痪飞船。"

"_So that means…"_ "这么说来……"

"_Captain! Damage Control teams report intruders on Deck 2!"_  
"舰长！损管小组报告说在二层甲板发现了入侵者！"

_So that's what this was.  
原来这就是他们的目的。_

"_I want all security teams heading to those areas now!" Misato shouted. This wasn't anything they had been prepared for. Fighting NERV Evangelion units was one thing, fighting in close quarters on your ship was another. Evangelions were clear targets with pilots…_  
"我要求所有安保小组立即前往这些区域！" 美里喊道。这完全超出了他们的准备范围。与 NERV 的福音战士作战是一回事，在自己的舰船内进行近距离战斗则是另一回事。福音战士是有着驾驶员的明确目标……

"_Where is the Second Child?" Misato barked. The crewmembers just looked at her confused. Misato mentally berated herself, they weren't all former NERV personnel after all._  
"二号机驾驶员在哪里？" 美里厉声问道。船员们只是困惑地看着她。美里在心里责备自己，他们毕竟不是所有都是前 NERV 的成员。

"_Pilot Shikinami. Where is Asuka?" Misato corrected herself._  
"式波·明日香·兰格雷驾驶员。明日香在哪里？" 美里纠正自己。

"_DSS collar located!" someone called from behind her, "She's trapped on Deck 3 near starboard medical!"_  
"DSS 项圈位置已确定！" 有人在她身后喊道，"她在右舷医疗区附近的第三甲板被困住了！"

"_how close is the nearest security squad?" Misato asked, her hand clenching into a fist. They could have sent an Eva after them, they could have destroyed them, they wanted something and she had a feeling they had come for the pilots._  
"最近的安保小队有多近？" 美里问道，她的手紧握成拳。他们本可以派出 EVA 追击，本可以将他们摧毁，他们有所图谋，而她有种感觉，他们是冲着驾驶员来的。

_Even if they weren't after them if they lost Asuka… if she lost Asuka, how much hope would they have left?  
即使他们不是冲着他们来的，如果他们失去了明日香……如果她失去了明日香，他们还能剩下多少希望？_

"_Squad Four and Five are currently engaged on Deck One, neither can disengage to get her!"_  
"四队和五队目前正在一号甲板作战，都无法脱身去救她！"

_Misato frowned and turned to place her hand on Ritsuko's shoulder. "Take care of things here."  
Misato 皱起眉头，转身将手搭在 Ritsuko 的肩上。“这里就交给你了。”_

_The blonde's eyes widened, "You can't be serious?"  
金发女子的眼睛睁大了，“你不是认真的吧？”_

_Misato nodded, "We need her."  
美里点头，“我们需要她。”_

"_And what about you? We can't have our commander dying on us."_  
“那你呢？我们可不能让指挥官就这样牺牲了。”

_She just gave a half smile, which struck the doctor. It was a show of her former more lighthearted self that was a rarity these days.  
她只是微微一笑，这让医生心头一震。那是她昔日更为轻松愉快的自我展现，如今已难得一见。_

_Unholstering her sidearm, she took off down stairways and passages, Misato ignored the rush of airmen, mechanics, and damage control parties by keeping her mind on the girl. She had just seen her on the deck not ten minutes ago, it was a miracle she was able to get below deck so fast let allow down to Deck 3 with that leg.  
她拔出配枪，沿着楼梯和通道疾奔，无视身边匆匆而过的飞行员、机械师和损管队伍，心中只想着那个女孩。十分钟前她还在甲板上见过她，她能这么快下到甲板下层，甚至到达三层，真是奇迹，更别提她那条腿了。_

_As the amount of crew thinned and the smell of smoke thickened, Misato began hearing the deafening sounds of gunfire amongst the backdrop of alarms. Steeling her nerves she pushed onto the medical bay, turning a blind eye to the odd body she came across as she moved through the bulkheads.  
随着船员逐渐稀少，烟味愈发浓烈，Misato 开始听到警报声中夹杂的震耳枪声。她鼓起勇气，继续向医务室推进，穿过舱壁时对沿途的奇怪尸体视而不见。_

"_Asuka?" she hissed, as she checked room by room, but there was no one to be found._  
“明日香？”她低声呼唤，逐个房间搜寻，却不见任何人影。

_Suddenly the sound of gunfire blared through the hallway, exasperated by the claustrophobic metal structure. Instinctively the woman took cover being one of the bulkheads while the crack of rounds passed her.  
突然，枪声在狭窄的金属走廊中回荡，愈发显得刺耳。女子本能地躲到一堵厚重的舱壁后，子弹呼啸而过。_

_Peaking out she saw the figure reloading and took her chance. She readied her pistol, aiming at the brown NERV uniform she knew too well only now their heads were entire encompassed in a black helmet, whipping away any human aspect they once held. She fired in quick succession while advancing on her target, out of the five rounds only two hit, a testament to her lack of practice.  
她探头望去，见那身影正在换弹，便抓住机会。她举起手枪，瞄准那熟悉的棕色 NERV 制服——如今他们的头部完全被黑色头盔包裹，抹去了曾经的人性特征。她迅速连射，边开火边逼近目标，五发子弹中仅两发命中，这足以证明她的训练不足。_

_The figure continued reloading their weapon and just as she prepared herself to jump behind the next bulkhead another shot rang out and the NERV operative fell to the ground. Cautiously Misato pushed forward trying to peek around the corner where the shot came from.  
那身影继续重新装填武器，就在她准备跳到下一个舱壁后面时，又一声枪响传来，NERV 的特工应声倒地。米萨托小心翼翼地向前推进，试图窥视枪声传来的角落。_

"_What are you doing down here?" Misato asked._  
“你在这里做什么？”米萨托问道。

_Kensuke was breathing heavily, his hands shaking as he lowered his pistol. Misato had seen that look before, on new recruits after their first combat, the adrenaline and fear fighting against one another. To be fair, he was doing better than most as he looked up from the body.  
健介呼吸急促，双手颤抖着放下手枪。米萨托曾见过这种表情，在新兵初次战斗后，肾上腺素与恐惧相互对抗。平心而论，他表现得比大多数人都要好，当他从尸体上抬起头时。_

"_Doing my best not to die, what about you?" He said flashing a fake smile._  
"尽我所能不去死，你呢？" 他假笑着说。

"_Asuka should be around here somewhere." She said, reloading and holstering her pistol._  
“明日香应该就在这附近。”她说着，重新装填并收起了手枪。

"_Shouldn't she be… I don't know with you when something like this happens?" he asked._  
“她不应该……我不知道，在这种时候和你在一起吗？”他问道。

_Misato crouched down, grabbed the NERV operative's submachine gun, and checked the body for anything useful. An extra handgun was secured in their chest rig, she quickly ejected the magazine and took the ammunition for herself. "I need you to get back up to the bridge, tell them Deck 3 still has intruders." She said ignoring his question.  
美里蹲下身，抓起 NERV 操作员的冲锋枪，检查尸体是否有有用的物品。胸挂装备上还固定着一把备用手枪，她迅速卸下弹匣，将子弹据为己有。“我需要你回到舰桥，告诉他们第三甲板仍有入侵者。”她无视了他的问题，说道。_

"_Alright." He answered as she stood up. She noticed his hands were still shaking and frowned._  
"好吧。" 他回答道，她站起身来。她注意到他的手还在颤抖，皱起了眉头。

"_Here," she said, shoving the freshly liberated weapon into his arms, "that'll serve you better."_  
"给，" 她说着，将刚解放的武器塞进他怀里，"这对你更有用。"

"_Thanks."_  "谢谢。"

_She raised an eyebrow as the man looked over the weapon, making sure he understood how to operate it. Suddenly she was back in Tokyo-03 again, watching a boy who had never known war marvel at weapons multitudes larger than himself.  
她挑了挑眉，看着那男人审视着武器，确保他懂得如何操作。突然间，她又回到了东京-03，目睹一个从未经历过战争的男孩对那些比自己大得多的武器感到惊奇。_

"_Go Kensuke." She said, bringing his attention back to her._  
“加油，健介。”她说道，将他的注意力拉回到她身上。

_He simply nodded, turning and going back the way she had came.  
他只是点点头，转身沿着她来时的路返回。_

_Misato continued her search, methodically checking room after room and doing her best to keep her mind off the occasional explosion and muffled gunfire.  
美里继续她的搜索，有条不紊地检查一个又一个房间，并尽力让自己的思绪远离偶尔的爆炸声和隐约的枪声。_

"_Let me go you freak!"_  
“放开我，你这个怪物！”

_Instantly the woman was on alert, running in the direction of the shout. It became rather easy to find them as Asuka did nothing but verbally assault whoever was with her.  
女人立刻警觉起来，朝着呼喊声的方向跑去。找到她们变得相当容易，因为明日香除了对身边的人进行言语攻击外，什么也没做。_

_When she finally made it to the group there were three NERV operatives with the girl, each was exactly like the one she had just dealt with. One was doing its best to drag her along with him while the others did their best to help. Asuka for all her worth continually kicked, scratched, and even bit at them slowing them down significantly.  
当她终于赶到那群人时，有三名 NERV 操作员围着那个女孩，每个都和她刚刚对付的那个一模一样。一个正竭尽全力拖着她走，而其他人则尽力帮忙。尽管如此，明日香还是不断踢打、抓挠，甚至咬他们，大大减缓了他们的速度。_

"_I said get your hands off me!"_  
“我说了，放开我！”

_Without thinking Misato rushed around the corner, unloading her pistol as accurately as possible without compromising the pilot. The two not holding Asuka collapsed without making a sound, while the other straightened himself up, his arm wrapped around the girl and using her as a shield while he grappled for his weapon.  
米莎托未加思索地冲出拐角，尽可能准确地开枪，同时确保不伤到驾驶员。那两个没有抓着明日香的操作员无声无息地倒下了，而另一个则挺直身子，手臂环绕着女孩，将她当作盾牌，同时伸手去拿武器。_

"_Put her down," Misato said, her aim steady, while Asuka did her best to keep struggling with him._  
“把她放下，”美里说道，她的瞄准稳如泰山，而明日香则竭尽全力与他搏斗。

"_Let me go…" Asuka still wrestled against the man, kicking and thrashing against him in an effort to break free of his grasp. She was able to loosen his grip and grabbed at his chest rig, tearing at pouches and holsters alike._  
“放开我…”明日香仍在与那人扭打，踢打挣扎试图挣脱他的控制。她成功松开了他的抓握，抓住他的胸甲，撕扯着口袋和枪套。

_Misato didn't know what went off first, the pistol in her hands or the one in the man's chest rig, but the outcome was no different. Her round slammed into his head, while the pistol on his chest discharged, striking him as well.  
美里不知道是先响起了她手中的枪声还是那人胸甲里的枪声，但结果并无二致。她的子弹击中了他的头部，而他胸甲上的手枪也走火击中了他自己。_

_It was over in an instant, and the body collapsed behind the girl, who turned back to look at Misato, her face was splattered with bits of red. She just froze, both of their ears ringing from the gunshot in such an enclosed area.  
一切在瞬间结束，尸体在女孩身后倒下，她转头看向美里，脸上溅满了红色的斑点。她只是僵住了，两人的耳朵因在如此封闭的空间内响起的枪声而嗡嗡作响。_

_Slowly Misato walked towards her, "Asuka? Are you ok?" she asked, reaching out slowly to her.  
美里缓缓走向她，“明日香？你还好吗？”她问道，慢慢地向她伸出手。_

_The girl's face held no emotion, but as soon as the woman's hand touched her shoulder, the girl lashed out. At first, Misato stiffed, thinking she was about to be attacked, but as the redhead collided with her, she felt no pain.  
女孩的脸上没有任何表情，但当女人的手触碰到她的肩膀时，女孩突然爆发了。起初，美里僵住了，以为自己即将受到攻击，但当红发女孩撞向她时，她并没有感到疼痛。_

_Instead, the girl's arms wrapped around her, bringing her into an embrace that she wasn't expecting. Misato felt something wet against her chest and as the ringing in her ears died down, she heard the quiet cries of the girl tethered to her.  
相反，女孩的双臂环绕着她，将她拥入一个未曾预料的怀抱。美里感觉到胸前有湿润的触感，随着耳边的嗡鸣声渐渐消退，她听到了紧贴着自己的女孩那低沉的啜泣声。_

_With only the two of them there, she couldn't bring herself to do anything other than lower her arms around the girl too, who only sobbed harder at the feeling of being held.  
只有她们两人在场，她无法让自己做出其他举动，只能同样地放下双臂环绕着女孩，而这一触碰让女孩的哭泣变得更加剧烈。_

_Misato felt the urge to reassure her, to tell her everything would be alright, but the words never came, instead, she just kept holding the sobbing girl until there were no more tears.  
Misato 感到一股安抚她的冲动，想要告诉她一切都会好起来的，但那些话语始终未曾出口，她只是紧紧抱着那个哭泣的女孩，直到泪水不再流淌。_

Asuka waited a few moments, leaning against the railing to watch the maintenance crews crawl over Unit-02 like ants. Even as she stood there dripping LCL she wanted to watch, to make sure they followed protocol, despite the last few years she still didn't trust them with her Unit-02.  
明日香等待了片刻，倚靠在栏杆上，观察着维修人员像蚂蚁一样在二号机上忙碌。即便她浑身滴着 LCL，她仍想看着，确保他们遵守规程，尽管过去几年她依然不信任他们处理她的二号机。

The fact she was also resting her leg was completely circumstantial.  
她顺便休息一下腿的事实完全是巧合。

Behind her, she heard the familiar pneumatic opening of the doors signaling someone's arrival. She ignored it at first, thinking it was just another technician before they spoke up.  
在她身后，她听到了熟悉的气动门开启声，预示着某人的到来。起初她没在意，以为是另一个技术人员，直到他们开口说话。

"Asuka." “明日香。”

The girl saw the dark red jacket in her peripheral vision but didn't say anything as Misato leaned against the railing.  
女孩在视线边缘瞥见了那件深红色的夹克，但当美里倚靠在栏杆上时，她并未作声。

"Anything to report?" “有什么要报告的吗？”

Asuka rolled her eye, "If there was, you'd know."  
“如果有的话，你早就知道了。”明日香翻了个白眼。

Misato didn't respond to the venom dripping from those words, instead, Asuka caught her pulling something from her jacket, lazily presenting it to her. Asuka turned her head to examine its contents and did her best to hide her amazement.  
美里对那些充满恶意的话语置若罔闻，反而从夹克里掏出一样东西，懒洋洋地递给明日香。明日香转头查看其内容，尽力掩饰自己的惊讶。

It had been so long since she had seen that SDAT player.  
她已经很久没有见过那台 SDAT 播放器了。

"Ritsuko cleared it, though it's broken," Misato explained.  
“律子清理过它，不过已经坏了，”美里解释道。

Asuka gingerly took it from the woman, a part of her felt it would disappear at the faintest touch, but it was there, solid to her touch, just like he had been. Opening the bag, she pulled it out, flipping the plastic in her hands, for how little she had seen it, it was just as she remembered.  
明日香小心翼翼地从女人手中接过它，心中的一部分觉得它会在最轻微的触碰下消失，但它就在那里，实实在在地触感，就像他曾经那样。她打开袋子，取了出来，翻转着手中的塑料壳，尽管她很少见到它，但它和她记忆中的一模一样。

"We'll be heading out at 0900."  
"我们将在 0900 出发。"

"Where?" Asuka asked, looking up.  
"去哪儿？" 明日香抬头问道。"

"Tokyo-03," Misato replied, pushing herself off the railing, "we're going to get him."  
"东京-03 区，" 美里回答，从栏杆上起身，"我们要去接他。"

Instantly Asuka was off the railing too, the player still in hand as neither one of them lost eye contact.  
瞬间，明日香也从栏杆上跳了下来，游戏机仍在手中，两人始终没有移开目光。

"You're actually going to trust me this time?" Asuka asked, it was clear why the woman had given her the player now. It was an olive branch, a sign of trust. It would've felt like an apology if she didn't know better.  
“这次你真的会信任我吗？”明日香问道，现在她明白为什么这个女人会把游戏机给她了。这是一根橄榄枝，一个信任的标志。如果不是她更了解情况，这几乎会像是一个道歉。

Misato nodded, "If he resists or is uncooperative, you'll be authorized to do everything in your power to bring him back."  
美里点头道：“如果他反抗或不合作，你将被授权尽你所能将他带回来。”

Asuka looked down at the player.  
明日香低头看着那台播放器。

"I'm trusting you; he could have lied, misled us, or worse. We still don't know the state of his mind, he spent 10 years in Unit-01s core, there's no telling what that does to someone." Misato explained, a hint of sadness creeping into her voice.  
“我选择相信他；他可能撒了谎，误导了我们，甚至更糟。我们仍不清楚他的心理状态，他在初号机的核心里度过了十年，无法想象那会对一个人造成什么影响。”美里解释道，声音中隐约透出一丝哀伤。

Asuka just felt her grip tighten on the cassette player, "He'll come back, he promised." She said, passing Misato and heading to the locker room.  
明日香只是感到自己握紧了那台磁带播放器，“他会回来的，他承诺过。”她说着，从美里身边走过，朝更衣室走去。

**Welcome back. It's been a while.  
欢迎回来。好久不见。**

**Really there's no excuse for me not putting anything out for so long, I really need to get back into the swing of things. The good news is I've kinda been working on the next two chapters as well, so they should be out in a few days.  
确实，这么久没更新实在没有借口，我真的需要重新找回状态。好消息是我已经在着手准备接下来的两章了，应该过几天就能发布。**

**SHOUTOUTS! 特别鸣谢！**

**Akomis – Very warm in your prediction! Let's find out next chapter? Yeah I've been waiting to throw the Wanders aspect in for so long. Thanks for the review!  
Akomis – 你的预测真是热情洋溢！接下来是第chapter章？没错，我早就迫不及待要引入 Wanders 元素了。感谢你的评论！**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – Gendo's arrogance isn't exactly misplaces, the Rebuild's work much differently than NGE.  
美利坚超旋队 – 碇源堂的傲慢并非毫无根据，《新世纪福音战士剧场版》的运作方式与原作大相径庭。**

**Guest – Thanks! Then they did exactly what they were meant to!  
访客 – 谢谢！那他们确实发挥了应有的作用！**

**Guest(2) – Thanks! 访客(2) – 谢谢！**

**engel17white – Yep moving forward!  
engel17white – 没错，继续前进！**

**JDH1080 – Wow thanks for that, definitely makes me feel even better about the story lol.  
JDH1080 – 哇，谢谢你这么说，确实让我对故事感觉更好了，哈哈。**

**skyf0x – Thanks! Your vessel comment is definitely something you want to remember. I like that you really picked up on the Shinji/Fuyutsuki dynamic, and I think Fuyutsuki's behavior was written with him simply being tired of it all. Regardless if Yui told him about her plan to begin with, he sees a destroyed world and for better or worse, Instrumentality is something he's come to accept as inevitable. However Shinji's words might be swaying him…  
skyf0x – 谢谢！你对“船”的评论确实值得记住。我很高兴你注意到了真嗣和冬月之间的动态，我认为冬月的行为写得就是他对这一切感到厌倦。无论最初唯是否告诉过他她的计划，他看到的是一个被摧毁的世界，不管怎样，人类补完计划对他来说已成为不可避免的事。然而，真嗣的话或许正在动摇他……**

**Calborghete – Thanks! Calgorghete – 谢谢！**

**Guest (3) – You never know, we'll see.  
访客（3）——谁知道呢，走着瞧吧。**

**tomdh1701 – Thanks! tomdh1701 – 谢谢！**

**Guest (4) – Yes he did, lol. Honestly I was curious why people thought 3.0 wouldn't be happening at first, because the summary line is from 3.0 to begin with haha.  
访客 (4) – 是的，他确实这么做了，哈哈。老实说，我一开始很好奇为什么人们认为 3.0 不会发生，因为摘要本身就是从 3.0 开始的，哈哈。**

**Guest (5) –** **Ovaltine is alright I guess?**  
访客 (5) – 阿华田还行吧，我想？

**EvaPilotFair – Thanks! I think it'll be interesting when he realizes that maybe Yui isn't quite the same in this world as his own.  
EvaPilotFair – 谢谢！我想当他意识到这个世界的唯可能与他自己的世界不完全相同时，会很有趣。**

**Captain Toast – Thanks! You're really into this story.  
吐司队长——谢谢！你真的很投入这个故事。**

**Alright, there should be another chapter out by the end of this week for a double header. Honestly, I think I kinda messed up pacing as we really have maybe 3 more 3.0 chapters after this, technically I could pad it but I'm not going to, I'm just gonna finish what I've been doing and see how it turns out.  
好吧，这周末应该还会有另一篇《一千零一夜》出来，来个双响炮。老实说，我觉得我在节奏上有点搞砸了，因为实际上在这之后我们可能只剩下三章左右的 3.0 内容了，技术上我可以拖长，但我不会这么做，我只会完成我一直在做的，看看结果如何。**

**Until Next Time!  下次再见！**


### Chapter 57: "…there will be no after, be no other day."  
Chapter 57: "…此后将不复存在，再无其他日子。"

The piano music didn't stop for him, it didn't even acknowledge his presence. The pale boy continued to run his fingers across the keys with unhampered enthusiasm, somehow appearing to become one with the music itself.  
钢琴曲并未为他停下，甚至未曾注意到他的存在。苍白的少年继续无拘无束地用手指在琴键上飞舞，仿佛与音乐融为一体。

Shinji resisted the urge to stop him, to slam his hand on the keys and let a foreboding cacophony of noise ring out. Instead, he let him play, listening to what this child of Adam could produce. The music flowed, and despite his feelings towards Kaworu, Shinji found himself disappointed as the notes came to a melancholic end, the boy's hands drawing out the last note as long as possible.  
真嗣强忍住阻止他的冲动，没有猛拍键盘让一阵不祥的嘈杂噪音响起。相反，他任由他弹奏，聆听着这个亚当之子能创造出的音乐。乐声流淌，尽管对渚抱有复杂情感，真嗣发现自己还是失望地看着音符以忧郁的方式结束，少年的双手尽可能延长了最后一个音符。

"It's not my own," Kaworu said, slowly tearing his hands away from the keys.  
“这不是我自己的作品，”渚说，缓缓地将双手从键盘上移开。

"What?" Shinji asked. “什么？”真嗣问道。

"The music," He said, gesturing to the instrument in front of him, "I could never create my own, much like my role in this world, I am unable to set out on a different path. That's where we differ Shinji."  
"音乐，" 他说着，指向面前的乐器，"我永远无法创作自己的曲子，正如我在世界中的角色，无法走上不同的道路。这就是我们不同的地方，真嗣。"

Shinji rolled his eyes; he was the last person the Angel should be seeking pity from.  
真嗣翻了个白眼；这个使徒最不该寻求的就是他的同情。

"I take it you remembered." Kaworu said, ending his line of thought and standing up, "One given a gift like your own should never have forgotten how it was received."  
"看来你还记得。" 渚薰结束了他的思绪，站起身来，"拥有你这样天赋的人，本不该忘记它是如何被赋予的。"

"Gift? You call this a gift!"  
"礼物？你管这叫礼物！"

"Most Lilin would." "大多数莉莉丝会这么认为。"

"If they knew what I'd been through then no one would've agreed!" Shinji shouted, shoving his finger in Kaworu's chest, "I've experienced horrors most people have never dreamed of! I wasn't given any warning, just thrown into this, dying and waking up over and over again."  
"如果他们知道我经历了什么，没人会同意的！"" 真嗣喊道，用手指戳着渚薰的胸膛，""我经历了大多数人连梦都没梦过的恐怖！我没有任何预警，就被扔进这一切，一遍遍地死去又醒来。"

"If you didn't, you would have never learned."  
"如果你没有，你就永远不会学到。"

"Learned what?" Shinji barked.  
"学到什么？" 真嗣厉声问道。

"Everything." Kaworu said simply, his eyes shining, "and you would have never made it here."  
"一切。" 薰简单地说道，他的眼睛闪烁着光芒，"而且你永远不会来到这里。"

"Exactly what does that have to do with it?"  
"那跟这件事有什么关系？"

"How do you think the world became this way?"  
"你认为世界为什么会变成这样？"

Shinji's figure deflated, his finger leaving Kaworu's chest, "Misato sounded like she blamed me, but that doesn't make any sense." He looked down at the piano, running his hands lightly across the keys. "I bet she blames me for not telling her, and she probably thinks I was working with Gendo because I didn't tell her what I knew."  
真嗣的身影似乎萎缩了，他的手指离开了渚薰的胸膛，“美里听起来像是在责怪我，但这毫无道理。”他低头看着钢琴，轻轻地抚过琴键。“我猜她怪我没有告诉她，而且她可能认为我没有告诉她我所知道的事情，是因为我在和源堂合作。”

Kaworu sighed, seemingly to contemplate the boy's words. "Come with me,".  
渚薰叹了口气，似乎在沉思少年的话。“跟我来。”

ʡʘʘʘʢ

The longer they walked, the more concerned Shinji became. Time crawled as they navigated a labyrinth of crumbling tunnels before finally, they emerged to the ruins of a familiar sight. The flattened area was well known to him. The firing position on Mount Futagoyama for Operation Yashima.  
他们走得越久，真嗣就越发担忧。时间仿佛停滞，他们在崩塌的隧道迷宫中艰难前行，最终来到了一处熟悉的废墟。这片被夷为平地的地方他再熟悉不过了。那是为了“八岛作战”在二子山上的射击阵地。

As soon as Kaworu opened the hatch, Shinji's badge blared inside the suit he had been provided. He swatted at his chest several times to silence it before he finally hit the right spot. He followed the other boy, eager now to get a view of the city, before stopping at the edge, unable to feel the wind that was whipping at the other boy's clothes.  
渚薰一打开舱门，真嗣身上的徽章就在他穿的外套里响了起来。他拍打了胸口好几次试图让它安静下来，最后终于找到了正确的位置。他紧跟着另一个男孩，急切地想要一睹城市的景象，却在边缘停下，感受不到那阵吹拂着对方衣物的风。

"This is what's left of Tokyo-03," Kaworu said emotionlessly.  
“这就是东京-03 的残骸。”渚面无表情地说道。

Shinji drank in the devastation below. Everything was a deep crimson, with the GeoFront exposed, what was left outside the massive crater had been left to rot, with what looked like the corpses of Evas embedded into the ground.  
真嗣凝视着下方的废墟。一切都被深红色浸染，GeoFront 暴露无遗，巨大弹坑外残留的一切仿佛被遗弃，任其腐朽，地面上似乎还嵌着 Eva 的残骸。

He wanted to rub his eyes, to make sure what he was seeing was real, but he resisted the urge, Kaworu was showing this to him for a reason.  
他想要揉揉眼睛，确认自己所见是否真实，但还是忍住了冲动，因为渚薰给他看这些是有原因的。

"What happened?" Shinji asked. A sickening idea crept into his mind. He hadn't been there, he had been sleeping in Unit-01. What if that was all it took? What if Asuka and whoever was left couldn't stop all the other Angels?, "Did they fail?"  
“发生了什么？”真嗣问道。一个令人不安的想法悄然爬上心头。他当时并不在场，而是在初号机里沉睡。难道这一切就足够了吗？如果明日香和剩下的人无法阻止所有使徒呢？“他们失败了吗？”

"No," Kaworu said, this demeanor still that of monotone. "This wasn't caused by any Angel, what the Lilin call the Near Third Impact was different. A stillborn Instrumentality, a failure at ascension."  
"不，" 渚薰说道，语气依旧平淡无波。"这并非任何使徒所为，你们人类所谓的近第三次冲击是不同的。这是一次夭折的融合，一次失败的升华。"

Kaworu turned to him, leading Shinji to try and read the boy, which was an art in and of itself, but at that moment, there was nothing Shinji could decipher.  
渚薰转向他，这让真嗣试图解读这个男孩，这本身就是一门艺术，但在那一刻，真嗣无法解读出任何信息。

"You caused it Shinji, you willed it, you merged with the Tenth Angel to ascend Unit-01 and open the Doors of Guff."  
"是你引发的，真嗣，你意愿如此，你与第十使徒融合，升华了初号机，打开了古夫之门。"

The words hung in the air between them, but eventually, Shinji could do nothing other than snort.  
话语悬在他们之间，但最终，真嗣只能发出一声轻蔑的哼声。

"C'mon," Shinji shook his head, "You expect me to believe that? Instrumentality doesn't work like that, and it certainly doesn't do this." He said pointing to their view.  
"得了吧，" 真嗣摇摇头，"你指望我相信这个？人类补完计划不是那样运作的，更不会造成这种结果。" 他指着他们的视野说道。

"Didn't you find the changes to this world odd?" Kaworu asked his eyes narrowing, his tone becoming more serious "The Second Impact purified the seas, the Third purified the land, now your father is preparing to finish his work."  
"难道你没有发现这个世界的变化很奇怪吗？" 渚薰眯起眼睛，语气变得更加严肃，"第二次冲击净化了海洋，第三次净化了大地，现在你的父亲正准备完成他的工作。"

"It can't just be triggered by Unit-01! It can't just be 'willed' to happen Kaworu! I should know!" Shinji shouted. "Unit-01 absorbed the S2 engine from Zeruel plenty of times before, I was trapped in the core for a whole month! That can't happen!"  
"不能仅仅由初号机触发！这不是靠意志就能发生的事，真嗣！我应该最清楚！" 真嗣喊道。"初号机之前多次吸收了零号使徒的 S2 引擎，我在核心里被困了一个月！这不可能发生！"

"You did more than absorb the Tenth Angel Shinji, you retrieved something else, correct?" Kaworu said, Shinji glanced over to Rei, but said nothing. "Besides, this world is not like your own, you've already accepted that, is it so difficult to now accept Instrumentality is different as well?"  
"你不仅仅是吸收了第十使徒，真嗣，你还取回了其他东西，对吧？" 渚薰说道，真嗣瞥了一眼绫波，但没有说话。"而且，这个世界与你原来的世界不同，你已经接受了这一点，现在接受人类补完计划也不同样困难吗？"

Shinji grabbed the boy by the collar, his temper flaring "I did not do this!"  
真嗣抓住少年的衣领，怒火中烧："我没有做这种事！"

"Not knowingly," Kaworu smirked, "However, there is hope, Unit-13 is the key."  
"并非有意为之，" 渚薰微微一笑，"然而，希望尚存，十三号机乃是关键。"

"To what?" "为了什么？"

"Everything," Kaworu said.  
"一切，" 渚薰说道。"

A gust of wind hammered them again, nearly causing Shinji to lose his footing, but he refused to bend to it and refused to let go of his shirt, he needed to hear this.  
一阵狂风再次猛烈袭来，险些让真嗣失去平衡，但他拒绝屈服于风力，也拒绝松开手中的衬衫，他需要听到这些。

"Explain." “解释一下。”

"Unit-13 was designed to be the final evolution of the EVAs, it is equipped with a dual entry system, your father created it under the need to break through to Lilith, but…"  
“13 号机是为了成为 EVA 的最终进化形态而设计的，它配备了双插入系统，你的父亲为了突破到莉莉丝而创造了它，但是……”

"But what?" "但是什么？"

"Unit-13 is capable of so much more than your father admits, even to SEELE. It is a vessel from which human instrumentality can be harnessed." Kaworu said, a flash of excitement in his eyes, "Do you know what the Doors of Guf really is?"  
"Unit-13 的能力远超你父亲向 SEELE 承认的，它是人类实现神化的载体。" 渚薰说道，眼中闪过一丝兴奋，"你知道古夫之门究竟是什么吗？"

Shinji frowned, "I've heard that term before. It has to do with Instrumentality, they were opened during the Second Impact, but I don't really remember them when I…" he stopped, not wanting to even say it out loud.  
真嗣皱眉，"我以前听说过这个词。它与神化有关，在第二次冲击时被打开，但我真的不记得当时我……" 他停了下来，不想大声说出来。

"Yes Shinji, they are connected, but here, they lead to something more, or perhaps less, tangible. The Anti-Universe."  
"是的，真嗣，它们是相连的，但在这里，它们通向某种更，或者说是更难以捉摸的东西。反宇宙。"

"And what exactly is that?"  
"那究竟是什么？"

"Whatever you will it to be," Kaworu said simply before smirking again, "or nothing at all. It is what separates every reality. Time and space have no meaning there, where laws of reality are easily broken or molded to one's will, where fate itself can be changed. That is the true value of Unit-13, to be able to traverse and manipulate the Anti-Universe with ease."  
"无论你希望它是什么，" 渚薰简单地回答，随即再次露出微笑，"或者什么都不是。那是区分每个现实的关键。在那里，时间和空间毫无意义，现实的法则轻易被打破或塑造成个人意愿，命运本身也能被改变。这就是 13 号机的真正价值，能够轻松穿越并操控反宇宙。"

"Gendo wants to affect other realities now?"  
“源堂现在想要影响其他现实了？”

"No, he neither realizes nor cares about the true potential of this creation, but you do," Kaworu said.  
“不，他既未意识到也不关心这项创造的真正潜力，但你知道，”渚薰说道。

"Why are you telling me this?"  
“你为何要告诉我这些？”

"Because it brings you to the end of your journey Shinji, the reason for your suffering and the ultimate goal you set out for," Kaworu said, placing a hand on his shoulder. "Unit-13 will lead you back home, through the tear in reality you once caused, and you can undo all that has transpired. That is what you wanted correct?"  
“因为这会带你走到旅程的终点，真嗣，你苦难的原因和你最初设定的终极目标，”渚薰说着，将手放在他的肩上。“十三号机将引领你回到家园，穿过你曾经造成的现实裂缝，你可以撤销所有发生过的事。那不正是你想要的吗？”

"You're saying…" Shinji let go of his shirt, stumbling backward.  
"你是说……" 真嗣松开了他的衬衫，踉跄后退。

"Yes, you can erase the sin that was committed so long ago. You can prevent the Third Impact in your original life that sent shockwaves through time and space and allowed you to be here."  
是的，你可以抹去那久远之前犯下的罪孽。你可以阻止原生世界中的第三次冲击，那场震荡时空的灾难，正是它让你得以存在于此。

"I can… end this." He breathed.  
"我可以……结束这一切。" 他喘息着说。

"Yes, you'll need to." "是的，你需要这么做。"

"I'll need to?" "我需要这么做？"

Kaworu nodded, "Your display ten years ago did more than just what you see. Like two ripples on water canceling each other out, what allowed you to travel this far has been nullified Shinji."  
渚薰点头道：“你十年前的表现，不仅仅是表面所见。就像水面上两道波纹相互抵消，让你走到这一步的力量已经被消除了，真嗣。”

"You mean I…" “你是说我……”

"I mean there will be no more do-overs, this will be the end, whether you succeed or fail."  
“我是说不会再有重来的机会了，无论成败，这都将是终点。”

ʡʘʘʘʢ

"SELLE's child has made contact with the Third?"  
“SELLE 的孩子与第三使徒接触了？”

"Yes," Fuyutsuki affirmed while the two of them overlooked Unit-13's incubation chamber. The commander had said nothing of his meeting with Shinji. Either he wasn't interested in the subject or he didn't know, if the elder had to guess it was the former option.  
“是的，”Fuyutsuki 确认道，两人正俯视着 13 号机的孵化舱。指挥官并未提及他与真嗣的会面。Fuyutsuki 猜测，要么是他对此事不感兴趣，要么就是他并不知情，若要他猜，他倾向于前者。

"Do you really think he'll pilot it willingly?" Fuyutsuki asked, probing at the man, seeing if he could get even an inkling of whether he knew.  
“你真的认为他会自愿驾驶它吗？”Fuyutsuki 试探性地问道，试图从对方那里探出哪怕一丝端倪，看他是否知情。

Even if he brought the subject up now, even if he told Ikari what he knew, he doubted he'd even believe him. Despite the near full affirmation, Fuyutsuki had wrangled from the boy, he doubted the man would care, to him the plan was complete, it was infallible, the world would be ushered into a new paradise.  
即便他此刻提起这个话题，即便他告诉碇司令他所知道的一切，他也怀疑对方是否会相信他。尽管从少年那里几乎得到了完全的确认，他仍怀疑那人会在意，对他来说，计划已经完成，它是无懈可击的，世界将被引领进入一个新天堂。

Paradise. 天堂。

Had he ever truly believed that, or was it only after the Near Third Impact ruined the earth completely? The elderly man had come to second guess every decision he had made over the last 30 years, somehow the web of secrets and deceit he had tried to escape only seemed to ensnare him more. Eventually, he had become resigned to his fate, the momentum of the mechanisms pushing for the Human Instrumentality Project's completion was simply too great for one man to overcome.  
他是否真的曾经相信过这一点，还是说只是在近第三次冲击彻底摧毁地球之后？这位老人已经开始怀疑过去 30 年里他所做的每一个决定，不知为何，他试图逃离的秘密和欺骗之网似乎只是将他缠得更紧。最终，他屈服于自己的命运，人类补完计划的完成势头对于一个人来说实在是太过强大。

Or so he had thought.  
或者他曾是这样认为的。

Now one child would have the power to decide the world's fate, Yui's child and he couldn't think of a more fitting person.  
如今，一个孩子将拥有决定世界命运的力量，那是唯的孩子，他想不到还有谁比这更合适。

As alarms sounded and lights flashed, the top of Unit-13s chamber opened, splattering bloody LCL over the entire apparatus. From the incubator rose the limb, the monstrous form of God's Eva.  
随着警报响起，灯光闪烁，13 号机舱顶开启，血红的 LCL 液体溅满了整个装置。从孵化器中升起的是那只肢体，神之 EVA 的恐怖形态。

"And so, a new god is born into this world." Gendo remarked, ignoring Fuyutsuki question, "One that will lead humanity to its ascension."  
“于是，一位新神诞生于这个世界。”源渡说道，无视了冬月的问题，“一位将引领人类走向升华的神。”

Fuyutsuki wasn't so sure.  
冬月并不那么确定。

He had laid eyes on the true god of this world, one for whom all others were clay in his hands. If Gendo was set on making his own, he feared there would be a war in heaven before the Earth could finally be at peace.  
他曾亲眼目睹这个世界的真神，一个令其他所有存在都如同他手中的泥土。如果源渡执意要创造自己的神，他担心在天国爆发战争之前，地球都无法真正获得安宁。

ʡʘʘʘʢ

Shinji sat on the edge of the cot given to him, the tray of food given to him lay forgotten next to him. The words Kaworu had said were still reeling in his mind, and if they were true then the idea that the end of all this was within his grasp was tantalizing.  
真嗣坐在分配给他的小床边，一旁的餐盘已被遗忘。渚薰的话语仍在脑海中回荡，如果这些话是真的，那么终结这一切的可能性近在咫尺，令人心痒难耐。

Although could he trust him?  
尽管，他能信任他吗？

He looked up, viewing the translucent specter that had remained silent since he realized the truth.  
他抬起头，凝视着那个自发现真相后便一直沉默的半透明幽灵。

"What do you think?" Shinji asked, "You wouldn't show yourself if you didn't have something to say."  
"你怎么看？" 真嗣问道，"如果你没有什么要说的，就不会现身了。"

_Soryu's face didn't change from a frown, that singular eye clearly judging him, but he didn't care.  
丽的面容依旧紧皱着眉头，那只独眼明显在评判他，但他并不在意。_

"It's different now. Don't you see that? I… We have a chance to fix things." Shinji said, lowering his head, "Isn't that what you would do? You'd try to make things right."  
"现在情况不同了。你没看出来吗？我……我们有机会去修正一切。" 真嗣低下头说，"这不是你会做的吗？你会努力让事情变得正确。"

"_I think you'd be an idiot for trusting him."_  
"我觉得你相信他会是个愚蠢的决定。"

Somehow her voice touched him differently now, with the new reality of her being real of Asuka really being there, that voice… he cherished it, loved it even, and that made it hurt so much more.  
不知为何，她的声音现在对他产生了不同的触动，随着她真实存在的全新现实，明日香真的在那里，那个声音……他珍惜它，甚至爱它，这让它更加痛苦。

Shinji couldn't help but smile. "Yeah, I figured that already," Shinji said, his hands refusing to stay still, wringing around each other in an effort to keep them from shaking. "But what if it's true?"  
真嗣忍不住笑了。“是啊，我早就猜到了，”真嗣说，他的手不愿安静，互相扭动着，试图阻止它们颤抖。“但如果这是真的呢？”

"_Do you really want to trust him again? After what it led you to do last time?"_  
“你真的还想再信任他吗？上次那事把你害得还不够惨吗？”

"I don't know if things would've turned out differently." Shinji confessed, the words bitter in his mouth, "but he has the most knowledge when it comes to this stuff, even more than me." Shinji admitted, "Why shouldn't I trust him?"  
"我不知道事情是否会有不同的结果。" 真嗣坦白道，话语中带着苦涩，"但在这方面，他的知识比我还丰富。" 真嗣承认，"我为什么不信任他呢？"

"_Because people shouldn't get second chances."_  
"因为人们不应该得到第二次机会。"

Shinji smiled sadly at that, "I did."  
真嗣对此苦笑了一下，"我得到了。"

_Asuka rolled her eye, "What about Wondergirl? What does she think about this?"  
明日香翻了个白眼，“那绫波呢？她对此怎么看？”_

Shinji looked over to the third one there with them. The girl had remained silent since his talk with Fuyutsuki, but now he could feel himself wanting her to talk, for either of them to talk to him, to tell him what to do.  
真嗣看向和他们一起的第三个人。自从他和冬月谈话后，这个女孩一直保持沉默，但现在他感到自己渴望她说话，无论是谁，只要能和他说话，告诉他该怎么做。

"_I do not know."_ “我不知道。”

"Then what does your gut tell you?" Shinji asked.  
"那么你的直觉告诉你什么呢？" 真嗣问道。

"_My gut?" Rei asked._ "直觉？" 绫波问道。

"_Your intuition Wondergirl, god why couldn't we have at least one life where you were normal."_  
"你的直觉，奇迹少女，天啊，为什么我们不能至少有一次生命让你变得正常。"

"_I believe it is the only choice you have, to trust him that is," Rei said._  
"我相信这是你唯一的选择，也就是信任他，"丽说道。

"_Well, you've never known him anyways, so your opinion doesn't count." Asuka rebuked._  
"反正你从来就不了解他，所以你的意见不算数。"明日香反驳道。

Shinji shook his head and buried it in his hands. He felt lost, something he hadn't felt in so long. Of all the worlds he's found himself in, why did this one have to be the one that played by different rules? He could almost feel the swaying of the train car, from the time he had run away from Misato's apartment. What he wouldn't give to be in that situation right now.  
真嗣摇了摇头，双手抱头。他感到迷茫，这种感觉他已经很久没有体会过了。在他所经历的所有世界中，为什么偏偏是这个遵循不同规则的世界？他几乎能感受到火车车厢的摇晃，那是他从美里公寓逃跑时的记忆。如果现在能回到那个情境，他愿意付出任何代价。

The door opened with a pneumatic swoosh before anyone could say anything more. Without looking up Shinji knew who it was and only became more irritated as he felt the weight land next to him on the bed.  
门在任何人能再说些什么之前便带着气动声猛地打开了。不用抬头，真嗣就知道是谁来了，而当感觉到那重量落在床边时，他的烦躁感愈发强烈。

"You're taking it better than expected."  
“你比预想的要冷静。”

Shinji brought his head out of his hands and glared at those red eyes, "Oh really?"  
真嗣从双手中抬起头，瞪着那双红眼睛，“哦，真的吗？”

"Yes. Do you now understand why I wanted you to remember? You wouldn't have believed me otherwise."  
"是的。你现在明白为什么我要你记住了吧？否则你不会相信我的。"

"I guess. My only question is how did you know?"  
"我想是的。我唯一的问题是，你怎么知道的？"

Kaworu smiled and looked in the direction of Rei, but said nothing to her, "Time, that's all. Everyone learns things through time."  
渚薰微笑着望向绫波，却没有对她说话，“时间，仅此而已。每个人都是通过时间来学习事物的。”

"Well… I think I've learned enough." Shinji stood up, turning his back to Kaworu. "I won't do it. I can't trust you."  
"嗯……我想我已经学得够多了。" 真嗣站起身，背对着薰。"我不会做的。我无法信任你。"

_Out of the corner of his eye, Shinji saw Asuka nodding in approval.  
眼角余光中，真嗣看到明日香点头表示赞同。_

"Alright then," Kaworu said. Shinji heard the creaking of the cot as the boy stood up, only to feel his hands lightly on his neck, "What if I did this?"  
"那好吧，" 薰说道。真嗣听到床铺的吱嘎声，男孩站了起来，接着感到他的手轻轻放在自己的脖子上，"如果我这样做呢？"

The pressure of the DSS choker suddenly was lifted, whipping around, Shinji's eyes widened as the boy placed the collar on himself, the collar whining as it locked around his throat.  
DSS 项圈的压力骤然消失，随即猛地旋转，真嗣的眼睛因那男孩自己戴上项圈而瞪大，项圈发出呜咽声，锁在了他的喉咙上。

"Don't act so surprised." Kaworu said with a smile, "It's your insurance, I'm sure you'd want it."  
“别这么惊讶。”渚薰微笑着说，“这是你的保险，我确信你会想要的。”

Frankly, Shinji was more annoyed the boy hadn't helped him get the choker off before, but now he failed to see exactly how it was going to make him more willing to pilot.  
坦白说，真嗣更恼火的是男孩之前没帮他取下项圈，但现在他看不出这东西如何能让他更愿意驾驶。

"It's not like I have the trigger, so what exactly does that do for me? Besides, what happened to 'equal value in life and death'?"  
"我又没有触发器，这对我到底有什么用？再说，‘生死等价’的原则去哪儿了？"

Kaworu laughed softly, "That's a fair point, but WILLE's collar is triggered by an Eva's awakening, not opening the Gates of Guf. With the spears, there won't be any need to awaken Unit-13 like you did with Unit-01." The boy explained, "and there's something I'm getting from this too."  
渚薰轻声笑道，“你说得有道理，但 WILLE 的项圈是由 Eva 的觉醒触发的，而不是打开古夫之门。有了这些长矛，就不需要像你唤醒初号机那样唤醒十三号机了。”少年解释道，“而且，我也能从中得到些东西。”

"What could you possibly get from helping me?" Shinji asked.  
“你帮我能得到什么呢？” 真嗣问道。

"Peace." Kaworu said, sitting back down, "Every world created by your original sin will be erased, and I'll be like you, without anywhere to go." He explained, rubbing his neck, "And I'll finally have made you happy, isn't that what you want Shinji? To be happy?"  
"和平。" 渚薰坐回原位，"你原罪所创造的每一个世界都将被抹去，而我将变得像你一样，无处可去。" 他解释着，揉了揉脖子，"而我终于能让你快乐了，这不正是你想要的吗，真嗣？快乐？"

Shinji didn't sit down next to him, he could only try and process the information he had been given. In all the time he'd known Kaworu, he never expressed a desire for any new goals. It was always the same, or it appeared that way.  
真嗣没有坐在他旁边，他只能尽力处理刚刚得到的信息。在他认识渚薰的所有时间里，他从未表达过任何新的目标。一切似乎总是老样子。

"_He could be lying." Asuka spoke up, "You don't know where the truths and lies begin or end with him."_  
"他可能在撒谎。" 明日香开口道，"你根本分不清他的真话和谎言从哪里开始，到哪里结束。"

"I guess," Shinji whispered.  
"我想，" 真嗣低声说道。

But he had to try. Shinji looked up to her, resting against the wall with her arms crossed. A look of complete disbelief that morphed into dissatisfaction.  
但他必须尝试。真嗣抬头看向她，她靠在墙上，双臂交叉。脸上先是完全的不敢置信，随后转变为不满。

He had to try for her.  
他必须为她而尝试。

"Alright," Shinji said, "Lets finish it."  
"好吧，" 真嗣说，"让我们完成它。"

Besides, the world had already ended here. How worse could they make it?  
再说，这个世界已经在这里终结了。他们还能让它变得更糟吗？

**Two chapters so close? What sorcery is this?  
两章如此接近？这是什么魔法？**

**Jokes aside we're approaching the end of 3.0. I definitely knew what I wanted to do with 3.0, but I didn't quite meet that goal. Asuka's story wasn't really finished, but I think I can make up for that at the beginning of what '4.0' will be. I put it in quotations because it'll be very different and spans a longer time period compared to the actually movie.  
玩笑归玩笑，我们即将结束 3.0 的旅程。我确实清楚自己想在 3.0 中实现什么，但并未完全达成那个目标。明日香的故事并未真正完结，但我认为在即将到来的‘4.0’初期，我能弥补这一点。之所以用引号，是因为它将与实际电影大相径庭，并跨越更长的时间段。**

**SHOUTOUTS! 特别鸣谢！**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – That'll be a fun moment  
来自美国的 UltraSpink – 那将会是个有趣的瞬间**

Calborghete – 会的！**

**– Am I darkness? – 我是黑暗吗？**

**deathbringer374 - :) 死亡使者 374 - :)**

**engel17white – I mean this is a pretty Anti-Kaworu story, I always saw him as a negative. Though in this story he actually has an incentive to be a positive force of change.  
天使 17 白 – 我的意思是，这故事挺反渚薰的，我总把他看作负面角色。不过在这篇故事里，他确实有动力成为一股积极变革的力量。**

**skyf0x – I love you caught a lot of the things I was trying to do with this chapter, but you forgot one important detail about Kensuke. He has a promise to uphold…  
skyf0x – 你捕捉到了我在创作这篇《1001》中试图表达的许多元素，但关于健次郎，你遗漏了一个重要细节。他有一个承诺需要坚守……**

**ih – Definitely reread chapter 10 for answers.  
ih – 绝对要重读《一千零一夜》第 10 章找答案。**

**Captin Toast – Thanks! I do think shorter chapters lend themselves to easier reading. Like even though there are now nearly 60 chapters, they're not super long so it's tantamount to snacking. At least in my eyes.  
Captin Toast – 谢谢！我也觉得短章节更适合轻松阅读。虽然现在差不多有 60 章了，但每章都不长，就像吃点心一样。至少在我看来是这样。**

**EvaPilotFair – Thanks man! I still don't like the lack of or implied backstory for her in 4.0. I don't know how much we'll get to, but I doubt it would really need more than a chapter to explore their relationship when they were younger, honestly it might not even need to be explored, it could just be implied.  
EvaPilotFair – 谢谢兄弟！我还是不喜欢 4.0 里她缺乏或暗示的背景故事。我不知道我们会了解到多少，但说实话，我怀疑要探索他们年轻时的关系，可能只需要《一千零一夜》那么长就够了，甚至可能都不需要深入探讨，暗示一下就够了。**

**Guest – I'm going to try real hard to keep them rolling.  
客人——我会尽力保持更新的。**

**Alright, new chapter up, I'm going to try really hard to keep up this pace, maybe upload every week to a week and a half.  
好的，新的chapter来了，我会努力保持这个节奏，或许每周到一周半更新一次。**

**Until Next Time. 下次再会。**

### Chapter 58: "…I need to be alone…"  
Chapter 58: "…我需要独处…"

Shinji pressed the compression button on his wrist and he closed his eyes, allowing the familiar sensation of the plugsuit snapping to his body.  
真嗣按下手腕上的压缩按钮，闭上眼睛，任由熟悉的插入栓服紧贴身体的感觉传来。

He hated it. He hated how it felt, he hated the fit, hell, he hated the color. He looked over his figure in the cracked mirror, despising the shades of dark purple that ran across his body. The cuffs came up over the lower half of his hand, nearly the base of his thumb, which just seemed impractical to him, he'd hate to actually fight in it.  
他讨厌这东西。他讨厌它的触感，讨厌它的贴合度，该死，他甚至讨厌它的颜色。他透过裂开的镜子审视着自己的身形，对那遍布全身的深紫色阴影深恶痛绝。袖口延伸至手掌下半部，几乎到了拇指根部，这在他看来极不实用，他可不想真的穿着它去战斗。

Kaworu stood next to him, donning the same type of suit with a sense of familiarity Shinji could recall Asuka having whenever she wore her suit. To them it was an extension of themselves, to him, it was a burden. Kaworu's colors were the mirror of his own with the dark purples taking precedence on his form.  
渚薰站在他旁边，穿着同样类型的制服，那种熟悉感让真嗣想起了明日香穿上她的制服时的样子。对他们来说，这是他们自身的一部分，对他而言，却是一种负担。渚薰的制服颜色与他自己的形成镜像，深紫色在他的身形上占据主导。

In the shattered facilities he had come to know, he somehow felt melancholic, it would be the last time on a mission from this room despite what it had come to represent and the deterioration it had endured.  
在这他已熟悉的破碎设施中，他不知为何感到忧郁，尽管这个房间已承载了太多象征意义和经历了种种衰败，这将是他最后一次从这个房间出发执行任务。

"I want to know something," Shinji spoke up, fiddling with his suit.  
"我想知道一些事情，" 真嗣开口说道，摆弄着他的制服。

"Yes?" Kaworu turned to look at him fully.  
"是的？" 渚薰完全转向他，看着他。

"What exactly is down there?" Shinji asked, "You said with the _spears_ we wouldn't need to awaken Unit-13."  
"下面到底有什么？" 真嗣问道，"你说过，用这些长矛我们就不需要唤醒 13 号机了。"

Kaworu smiled, "I figured you'd ask, it's in your nature. In this world, Lilith's spear, Cassius, survived. I used that spear to quell your ascension ten years ago."  
渚薰微笑道，“我就知道你会问，这是你的本性。在这个世界，莉莉丝的长枪，卡西乌斯，幸存了下来。我利用那把长枪阻止了你十年前的晋升。”

Shinji's eyes snapped up to Kaworu, "You caused that? You're the reason I was stuck in Unit-01 for ten years?!" he reached out and grabbed the boy by the front of his shirt.  
真嗣的目光猛地转向渚薰，“是你造成的？你就是我被困在初号机里十年的原因？！”他伸手抓住了少年的衣领。

"Those were my orders, though, I suspect it wasn't part of their scenario." Kaworu explained calmly, unmoved by the outburst, "During the extraction of the spear from Unit-01, the eleventh and twelfth angels appeared, we were forced to use Longinus and eventually Cassius once it was separated, but the Near Third Impact had already begun again."  
“那是我的命令，不过，我怀疑这并非他们的计划。”渚薰平静地解释，对这番爆发不为所动，“在从初号机中取出长枪的过程中，第十一和第十二使徒出现了，我们被迫使用朗基努斯，最终在分离后使用了卡西乌斯，但近第三次冲击已经再次开始。”

"So what is down there?" Shinji asked, not letting go of Kaworu.  
“下面有什么？”真嗣问道，没有放开渚薰的手。

"The spears, Lilin, and Mark 06. The Lilin made Mark 06 autonomous, and it was sacrificed to stop the Twelfth Angel, being sealed away inside the Evangelion, before Central Dogma itself was cut off from the world."  
“长枪、人类和第六使徒。人类让第六使徒自主化，它被牺牲以阻止第十二使徒，被封印在福音战士内部，之后中央教条区本身也被隔绝于世。”

Shinji frowned, "Why wouldn't I have come back earlier then? You said they removed Cassius from Unit-01."  
真嗣皱眉，“那我为什么没有早点回来？你说过他们把卡修斯从初号机中移除了。”

"Simple, Unit-01 has sealed away. You shouldn't be angry Shinji, you wouldn't have a world to wake up to if I hadn't stopped you 10 years ago." Kaworu said, his hands coming up and grasping Shinji's "Besides, it's all led you here, to Unit-13."  
“简单来说，初号机已经被封印了。真嗣，你不该生气的，如果十年前我没有阻止你，你醒来时就不会有这个世界了。”渚薰说道，双手抬起握住真嗣的，“再说，这一切都把你引到了十三号机这里。”

Shinji let go of Kaworu's shirt, and sighed. "Is there anything else I should know?", the annoyance clear in his voice.  
真嗣松开了渚薰的衬衫，叹了口气。“还有其他我应该知道的事吗？”他的声音中明显带着不悦。

Kaworu stiffened slightly, maybe not enough for the average viewer to notice, but to Shinji, he practically was screaming in terror as he donned his plugsuit.  
渚薰微微僵硬了一下，或许不明显到普通观众无法察觉，但对真嗣来说，他几乎是在尖叫着穿上插入栓服。

"What is it?" Shinji asked, somehow knowing he would be hearing more.  
“这是什么？”真嗣问道，不知为何他知道接下来会有更多信息。

"If… when you make across the Anti-Universe… two exact souls cannot exist within the same world. It is an immutable law of existence. It's why there's only ever been one of you."  
“如果你……当你穿越到反宇宙……两个完全相同的灵魂不能存在于同一个世界。这是存在的不可变法则。这也是为什么世界上永远只有一个你。”

"And that means?" “那意味着什么？”

"A Lilin's soul will inverse, you will only have so long to change the destiny of your world Shinji, if you fail…"  
"莉莉丝的灵魂将会反转，真嗣，你只有有限的时间来改变你世界的命运，如果失败了……"

"I won't fail." Shinji said, cutting him off.  
“我不会失败的。”真嗣打断了他。

Kaworu nodded, "Then let us begin."  
渚薰点头道：“那么，我们开始吧。”

ʡʘʘʘʢ

"_Look at them," Asuka spat, while she leaned against the wall, "he's really going to listen to him. The idiot doesn't even listen to me! Case in point, why you're here Wondergirl."_  
"看看他们，" 明日香啐了一口，靠在墙上，"他真的会听他的。那个白痴甚至不听我的！比如说，你为什么会在这里，真希波。"

"_Is it so wrong to have hope?" Rei asked, standing next to her._  
"怀抱希望有错吗？" 绫波零站在她旁边问道。"

"_When it comes from that one? Absolutely!"_  
"如果是从那个人嘴里说出来的？绝对有错！"

"_For him, the world is a darkness without hope, so he scrapes away at it with any opportunity he possesses."_  
"对他而言，世界是一片没有希望的黑暗，所以他用自己拥有的每一个机会去削减它。"

_Asuka crossed her arms, "'Man fears the darkness, and so he scrapes away at the edges of it with fire.' If you're going to say it, say it right."  
明日香交叉双臂，"'人类害怕黑暗，因此他用火光去削减它的边缘。' 如果你要说，就说得准确些。"_

"_Perhaps the fire you speak of is hope," Rei said. "And you are a testament to why one should hope."_  
"或许你所说的火光就是希望，" 绫波说。"而你证明了为何人们应该怀抱希望。"

"_Why's that?"_ "为什么这么说？"

"_Because you carried so much of it." Rei explained, "Your will alone manifested you for Shinji to see, you broke through the barrier you were never meant to pierce."_  
"因为你承载了太多。" 丽解释道，"仅凭你的意志，你就显现出来让真嗣看见了，你打破了本不该穿透的屏障。"

"_So, you're saying I was always just meant to watch?" Asuka's fists clenched, "What? Is that some sick torture I was supposed to endure?"_  
"所以，你是说我本就注定只能旁观？" 明日香的拳头紧握，"什么？难道这是某种病态的折磨，我本该承受的？"

"_It was a gift."_ "这是一份礼物。"

"_A GIFT?!"_ "一份礼物？！"

"_Yes," Rei tilted her head, "That is where you and Shinji differ. He will not waste this gift, you, however…"_  
"是的，" 丽侧了侧头，"这就是你和真嗣的不同之处。他不会浪费这份礼物，而你，然而……"

"_What?"_ “什么？”

"_You do not hope anymore," Rei said, an uncharacteristic sadness lining her voice._  
"你不再抱有希望了，"丽说道，声音中带着不寻常的悲伤。

_Asuka narrowed her eyes, how dare the doll talk to her about hope. How dare Gendo Ikari's puppet even try to comprehend what she had been through, what they both had been through. Her face contorted into one of disgust and she pushed herself off the wall, heading in Shinji's direction.  
明日香眯起眼睛，这个玩偶怎么敢和她谈希望。怎么敢让源渡的傀儡试图理解她经历了什么，他们俩经历了什么。她的脸扭曲成厌恶的表情，推开墙壁，朝真嗣的方向走去。_

"_Third!" Asuka barked, storming up behind the oblivious boy._  
"第三！"明日香厉声喝道，气势汹汹地走到毫无察觉的男孩身后。

_He turned, and Asuka knew that look on his face. The one of uncertainty, the one he always used to wear. It was a far cry from the face she had come to know.  
他转过身来，明日香一眼就认出了他脸上的那种表情。那种充满不确定性的表情，他过去常常带着的那种。这与她逐渐熟悉的面孔相去甚远。_

"_You really think this is a good idea?" she asked._  
“你真的认为这是个好主意吗？”她问道。

"No, not really. But what choice do I have?"  
“不，并不真的这么认为。但我还有什么选择呢？”

"_You don't HAVE to go."_  
"你不必非去不可。"

"If there's even a chance to get you…"  
"哪怕只有一丝机会能救你……"

"_Don't keep telling me this is about a chance! Don't you say this is for me!" Asuka shouted, sticking her finger in his face, "You're the reason we're in this mess to begin with."_  
"别再跟我说这是为了什么机会！别跟我说这是为了我！" 明日香大喊着，用手指戳着他的脸，"这一切麻烦本来就是你造成的。"

Shinji lowered his head, unable to give her what she wanted, but she understood. Nothing she was saying would keep him from this foolish endeavor.  
真嗣低下头，无法给予她所渴望的，但她理解。无论她说什么，都无法阻止他这愚蠢的行动。

"_Alright… if you do this… don't expect me to be here when it all goes wrong." Asuka put every ounce of venom she could into those words. It was all she could do to try and keep him from doing this, and for a fleeting moment, she saw what she considered reason flash in his eyes as his head rose, before it was replaced with something else. She knew it all too well, it was the same look she remembered seeing in the volcano.  
“好吧……如果你执意如此……别指望一切出错时我会在你身边。”明日香将所有能注入的怨恨都倾注在这句话中。她只能尽力阻止他，有那么一瞬间，她看到他眼中闪过一丝她认为是理智的光芒，但随即又被另一种神情所取代。她对此再熟悉不过了，那正是她在火山口所见过的眼神。  
_

"I have to try." 我必须试试。

_With that, he turned and walked out of the dressing room, the door jamming open behind him. Asuka caught Rei walking up and standing beside her.  
说完，他转身走出了更衣室，门在他身后卡住敞开着。明日香看到绫波零走上前来，站在她身边。_

"_You didn't finish it," Rei said._  
“你没完成。”绫波说。

"_Finish what?" Asuka asked._  
“完成什么？”明日香问。

"_The saying." Rei replied, " 'He creates life by diminishing the darkness.'"_  
“那句话。”丽回答道，“‘他以驱散黑暗来创造生命。’”

ʡʘʘʘʢ

Asuka looked down at the SDAT, the cords woven tightly between her fingers. A part of her kept thinking it would disappear, turn translucent and fall through her fingers, but it had yet to leave her.  
明日香低头凝视着 SDAT，耳机线在她指间缠绕得紧紧的。她的一部分思绪始终在想，它会消失，变得透明，从指缝间滑落，但它至今未曾离开。

"If you keep looking at it like that it'll ruin your good eye." Mari joked, trying to release some of the tension in the locker room. The attempt fell flat, and Asuka showed no notion she even heard her. Realizing this wouldn't be so simple, Mari just sighed, sitting down next to Asuka, "Listen, Misato…"  
"你要是再这么盯着看，好眼睛也要被你瞪坏了。" 玛丽开玩笑道，试图缓解更衣室里的紧张气氛。然而这番努力毫无效果，明日香似乎根本没听见她的话。意识到事情没那么简单，玛丽叹了口气，坐到明日香旁边，"听着，美里……"

"Doesn't know what she's talking about. Shinji knew me, he recognized me." Asuka replied flatly.  
"她根本不知道自己在说什么。真嗣了解我，他认得我。" 明日香平淡地回应。

"And you don't think he could have been lying all this time?"  
"你就没想过他可能一直在骗你吗？"

"I don't know," Asuka said, standing up, signaling she wanted to be done with this conversation. She looked over her plugsuit, making sure all the patchwork was undamaged  
"我不知道，" 明日香说着站起身来，示意她想结束这场对话。她检查着自己的插入栓服，确保所有的补丁都完好无损

"At the very least his sync rating was zero, so he shouldn't be able to pilot," Mari commented.  
"至少他的同步率是零，所以他应该无法驾驶，" 真希波评论道。

"I wouldn't be so sure." Asuka said, putting another layer of tape on her thigh, "He always said sync ratios weren't everything."  
"我可不会那么肯定。" 明日香说，又在腿上贴了一层胶带，"他总是说同步率并不是一切。"

"Yeah, but it was ZERO. I mean, just from what I've heard about him I wouldn't be surprised if he had a trick or two up his sleeve." Mari commented.  
“是啊，但那可是零。我是说，就我听说的关于他的那些事，如果他藏了一两手绝活，我一点也不会惊讶。”玛丽评论道。

"He was good." Asuka said, pausing her fiddling, "Better than me even." She admitted.  
“他很厉害。”明日香停止了摆弄，说道，“甚至比我还要强。”她承认道。

Mari's eyes widened, that was the first time she had ever heard the Princess say anyone was better than her.  
玛丽的眼睛瞪大了，这是她第一次听到公主承认有人比她更强。

"What if he doesn't want to go?" Mari asked.  
"如果他不想去呢？" 玛丽问道。

"If he doesn't want to go?"  
"如果他不想去？"

"C'mon, you can't tell me you haven't thought about it. What if you're wrong, what if he really was working with his father?"  
"拜托，你不能告诉我你没想过这个。如果你错了呢，万一他真的和他父亲合作了呢？"

"I don't… can't, believe it was all a lie," Asuka said quietly, her fist clenching, "but if it was… I'll end him."  
"我不……无法相信这一切都是谎言，" 明日香轻声说道，拳头紧握，"但如果真是如此……我会终结他。"

"Would you be able to?" Mari asked.  
"你能做到吗？" 真里问道。"

Asuka looked up, that blue eye holding back emotions Mari had never truly seen, hidden deep within the girl. Just by how she responded to any mention of the boy, Mari could tell her teammate held clashing emotions towards him.  
明日香抬起头，那只蓝眼睛压抑着真里从未真正见过的情感，深藏于女孩内心。仅凭她对任何提及那男孩的反应，真里就能看出她的队友对他怀有矛盾的情感。

Before Asuka could answer, the room was awash in red, causing both girls to dash toward the hangar. As they ran, an alarm rang out through the ship.  
在明日香能回答之前，房间已被红色淹没，两女孩急忙冲向机库。她们奔跑时，警报声响彻整个舰船。

"S2 Engine activation detected! A New EVA-Unit has been activated!"  
“S2 引擎激活检测到！新的 EVA 单位已被激活！”

Asuka felt something grow in the pit of her stomach and pushed to go faster, damn the pain in her leg with every step. That announcement meant one thing, and as she reached her entry plug, she wished _he_ hadn't done anything foolish.  
明日香感到胃里一阵翻腾，不顾腿上的疼痛，每一步都竭尽全力加速。那个通告意味着一件事，当她到达插入栓时，她希望他没有做出任何愚蠢的举动。

He had a promise to keep.  
他有一个承诺要遵守。

ʡʘʘʘʢ

"_How are you feeling?"_ “你感觉怎么样？”

_Asuka grumbled something incoherent and clicked the wrist-mounted button, waiting for the familiar sensation of the plugsuit pulling to her body, but to no avail. Her temper flared, cursing as she did another check over her plugsuit.  
明日香咕哝着含糊不清的话，按下了手腕上的按钮，等待着那熟悉的紧身衣贴合身体的感觉，却徒劳无功。她的脾气顿时爆发，一边咒骂一边再次检查起自己的驾驶服。_

"_Here." She growled, banging the wrist cuff in her hand a few times before donning the suit again._  
"给。" 她咆哮着，把手中的腕扣猛敲了几下，然后再次穿上紧身衣。

_This time it worked, the suit conforming to her body with only her left arm failing to do so this time. The girl quickly snatched a roll of red adhesive and swiftly patched the synthetic material, letting it finally compress to her body.  
这次成功了，紧身衣贴合她的身体，只有左臂这次没有完全贴合。女孩迅速抓起一卷红色粘合剂，迅速修补了合成材料，让它最终压缩贴合到她的身体上。_

"_It's a shame maintenance hasn't been on top of these," Mari said, trying not to show her comparatively untouched plugsuit. It wasn't that she never saw combat, far from it, but her Evangelion wasn't exactly as… direct in combat as Unit-02._  
"维修部门真该好好检查这些装备，" 玛丽说，尽量不显露出她相对完好的插入栓服。并非她从未参与战斗，远非如此，但她的 EVA 机体并不像 2 号机那样…在战斗中直接。

"_I've been telling them for months we need new ones." Asuka grumbled, "Like everything here, it's a patch job."_  
"我几个月前就跟他们说过我们需要新的。" 明日香咕哝着，"就像这里的一切，都是临时凑合的。"

_Mari did the final checks of her suit, before picking up her helmet. She moved to leave the dressing room and head to her entry plug, but she looked back, seeing her wingman holding that cross in her hands again.  
真希波完成了她的作战服最后检查，然后拿起头盔。她准备离开更衣室前往她的插入栓，但回头一看，发现她的僚机再次拿着那枚十字架。_

"_You're up for this, right?" Mari asked._  
"你能搞定这个，对吧？" 玛丽问道。

"_There's nothing left up there but the corpse of Unit-01." to Mari, it sounded like she was saying that to convince herself more than anything. "He broke his promise," Asuka whispered, but loud enough for Mari to hear._  
"那里只剩下零一号机的残骸了。" 对玛丽来说，这听起来更像是在说服自己，而非其他。"他违背了承诺，" 明日香低声说道，但足够让玛丽听见。

"_What was that?"_ "那是什么？"

"_Nothing." Asuka grabbed her helmet and pushed past her, heading towards the door, "We're bringing home a corpse, nothing more."_  
"没什么。" 明日香抓起头盔，从她身边挤过，朝门口走去，"我们带回一具尸体，仅此而已。"

"_Princess…" Mari started, but Asuka didn't respond, "Asuka."_  
"公主…" 玛丽开口，但明日香没有回应，"明日香。"

_The redhead stopped, and her usually stiff figure deflated with a sigh.  
红发女子停下脚步，平日里僵硬的身姿随着一声叹息松弛下来。_

"_Like I said last night, try to get some closure from this, don't write it off."_  
“就像我昨晚说的，试着从中找到些许释怀，别轻易放弃。”

_Asuka didn't turn, but after a moment she nodded, before putting her helmet on and walking out the door.  
明日香没有转身，但片刻后她点了点头，戴上头盔，走出了门。_

**When I was searching out the -120 min translation again, I stumbled across something interesting. Apparently, Anno stated that "**Kaworu became commander, and Kaji became Vice-Commander**" after 2.0, hence why we see them in those clothes at the end of 4.0. How that happens and then Gendo/Fuyutsuki are in charge again is beyond me, but according to the interview, a 'scenario' for the events exists. I understand deliberately keeping information from your audience for effect, and I'm sure I've written about it before, but damn at least publish something so we know, even if it doesn't make any sense.**  
当我再次寻找-120 分钟的翻译时，我偶然发现了一些有趣的东西。显然，庵野秀明曾表示，“在 2.0 之后，渚薰成为了指挥官，加持良治成为了副指挥官”，这就是为什么我们在 4.0 的结尾看到他们穿着那些衣服。至于这如何发生，然后源堂/冬月又重新掌权，我就不清楚了，但根据采访，这些事件有一个‘剧本’。我理解为了效果故意向观众隐瞒信息，我确信我之前也写过这一点，但至少发布一些东西让我们知道，即使它没有任何意义。

**Honestly, I figured the 'Kaworu in commander's clothing' was part of the Anti-Universe shenanigans, but now I'm just more confused. As well as Kaji's 'sacrifice'. At first glance, the movie is cut so that it is insinuated Kaji died stopping something that happens just after 3.0's ending. However, after I went back and rewatched, Kaji is wearing Fuyutsuki's outfit then. Also, behind Misato is what appears to be Wunder's three dishes and 'ribs'. Ritusko is also there, however her hair is not cut.  
老实说，我原以为‘渚薰穿着指挥官服装’是反宇宙恶作剧的一部分，但现在我更加困惑了。还有加持的‘牺牲’。乍一看，电影剪辑得似乎暗示加持在 3.0 结尾之后阻止了某件事而死去。然而，当我回去重新观看时，加持当时穿着冬月的衣服。此外，在美里身后，似乎是 Wunder 的三个碟子和‘肋骨’。律子也在那里，但她的头发没有剪。**

**So now we have even a greater mess of the canonical timeline haha.  
所以现在我们有了一个更加混乱的正统时间线哈哈。**

**SHOUTOUTS 致谢**

**Fluffiddy – Yeah, gotta keep doing that.  
Fluffiddy – 没错，得继续保持。**

**Noneofit – What Organization? *wink  
Noneofit – 什么组织？*眨眼**

**5queso – Thanks! 5queso – 谢谢！**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – Perhaps….  
美利坚的超斯宾克 – 或许……**

**engel17white – Maybe, or maybe we could instead choose a better path?  
engel17white – 也许吧，或者我们可以选择一条更好的道路？**

**Attila1987 – Oh your idea of Kaworu manipulating Shinji isn't all that off in my opinion. Sure it's for his 'happiness' and white lies are always used, and that's the essence of Kaworu, he's not true happiness. I do believe here he's working under incomplete knowledge the same as Shinji, but that's not to say he isn't explaining everything right away, hence what he's speaking of in this chapter, he tells that to Shinji right before they start.  
Attila1987 – 哦，你认为渚薰操纵真嗣的想法在我看来并不离谱。当然，这是为了他的‘幸福’，而且总是使用善意的谎言，这就是渚薰的本质，他并非真正的幸福。我确实认为他和真嗣一样，都在不完全了解的情况下行动，但这并不意味着他没有立即解释一切，因此他在《chapter》中对真嗣说的话，就是在他们开始之前告诉真嗣的。**

**Guest – Shinjis Mad! Shinjis Mad!  
客人 – 新治生气了！新治生气了！**

**skyf0x – I like how you pick up on those small details haha. 3.0 is finally drawing to a close for sure, and hopefully this new path is making a tad bit more sense than the original. The main issue is how do you try to play by canon rules when canon is so confusing? Thanks for the review, as always it's great!  
skyf0x – 我喜欢你注意到那些小细节哈哈。3.0 终于要结束了，希望这条新路比原来的稍微清晰一些。主要问题是，当原作如此混乱时，你如何尝试按照原作规则来玩？一如既往，感谢你的评论，非常棒！**

**Captin Toast – Here we go!  
Captin Toast – 开始了！**

**Again, it feels like I keep saying this every chapter, but sorry for the long delay. School has me worn out.  
再次，感觉我每次都这么说，但真的很抱歉拖了这么久。学校的事让我筋疲力尽。**

**Until Next Time. 下次再会。**

### Chapter 59: "…Standing on the Edge of the Underworld…"  
Chapter 59: "…站在冥界边缘…"

Big. 巨大。

That was the first thing he thought when seeing the Evangelion for the first time.  
那是他第一次见到福音战士时想到的第一件事。

Unit-13 was a towering mass of flesh and metal, much larger than any other EVA. With what little time he had to examine it, he guessed a normal Eva would only rise to below its shoulders, and of all the variations of EVAs he'd piloted, he couldn't recall a single one comparable to it.  
13 号机是一个由肉体和金属构成的庞然大物，比任何其他 EVA 都要大得多。在他有限的观察时间里，他猜测一个普通的 EVA 可能只能达到它的肩膀以下，而在他驾驶过的所有 EVA 变种中，他记不起有任何一个能与之相提并论。

The rusty catwalk groaned in protest with every step, years of neglect had gotten to it like every other part of the base, but Shinji paid it no mind, he was entirely transfixed on the violet metal titan in front of him. A tad darker shade than Unit-01, it almost matched the color of his plugsuit.  
生锈的走道每走一步都发出抗议般的吱嘎声，多年的忽视让它像基地的其他部分一样破败，但真嗣对此毫不在意，他的全部注意力都集中在面前这个紫色的金属巨人身上。它的颜色比 01 号机略深，几乎和他的插入栓服颜色相匹配。

Looking over at the parallel walkway, Kaworu met his eyes and gave a familiar reassuring smile, one Shinji refused to reciprocate. As he waited for the entry plug to move closer, he could feel the eyes of his father on him, he didn't know where he was, but he was sure he was watching.  
瞥向旁边的平行步道，渚薰与他目光相接，露出了熟悉的安抚微笑，但真嗣拒绝回应。在等待插入栓靠近时，他能感觉到父亲的目光落在自己身上，虽然不知道身处何方，但他确信父亲正在注视着他。

Instead of dignifying him with any acknowledgment, he climbed into the entry plug and allowed the familiar smell of LCL to overtake him. He had noted how the duel entry system was different outside, how the entry plugs were inserted at an angle near the shoulders and into the torso. The sensation was different, but perhaps that was due to the new cockpit. Its sleek lines and controls were novel, but the layout and general functionality were not.  
他没有给予任何回应，径直爬进插入栓，任由熟悉的 LCL 气味包围自己。他注意到双插入系统在外部的不同之处，插入栓以肩部附近的角度插入躯干。这种感觉有所不同，或许是因为新的驾驶舱。其流线型的线条和控制装置新颖，但布局和基本功能并未改变。

The display shifted, coming alive with a mosaic of colors around him revealing his co-pilot next to him, already looking in his direction. The mere sight of another seat and set of controls was so outlandish to him, like a fundamental law of nature was being broken. So too were the golden streams that surrounded them, connecting both seats.  
显示屏切换，周围亮起五彩斑斓的马赛克，显示出他的副驾驶员已在他身旁，正朝他看来。另一张座椅和控制装置的存在对他来说如此荒谬，仿佛自然法则被打破。同样，环绕他们的金色流光连接着两张座椅，也是如此。

_Behind him, Rei sat, calmly, taking in all that was happening. In the other entry plug, Asuka sat behind Kaworu, legs crossed and wearing the deepest frown he had ever seen, but she stayed silent.  
在他身后，丽静静地坐着，观察着发生的一切。在另一个插入栓里，明日香坐在薰的后面，双腿交叉，眉头紧锁，是他见过的最深的皱眉，但她保持沉默。_

"What do you think?" Kaworu asked, "The Lilin really outdid themselves this time."  
“你怎么看？”薰问道，“这次人类真的超越了自己。”

"The pilot is more important than the EVA." Shinji frowned and grabbed the controls, "I'll let you know in a second."  
“驾驶员比 EVA 更重要。”真嗣皱着眉头抓住控制器，“我马上告诉你。”

"Hmmm," Kaworu didn't reply as he too took the controls in his hands, he closed his eyes and took a deep breath, "Evangelion unit-13, alive at last."  
"嗯," 渚薰没有回答，他也握住了操纵杆，闭上眼睛深吸了一口气，"福音战士 13 号机，终于活过来了。"

Instantly, Shinji hated this sensation. A slight headache formed causing him to furrow his brow. It was as if he was walking with double vision, his senses doubled, his world doubled. There were two cores, two pilots, two souls, he could work with Kaworu, despite his feelings he could manage it, but it felt wrong. It felt like he was corralling someone like he was forcing something along.  
瞬间，真嗣讨厌这种感觉。轻微的头痛让他皱起了眉头。仿佛他是在用双重视野行走，感官加倍，世界加倍。有两个核心，两个驾驶员，两个灵魂，尽管他对渚薰有感情，但他能应付，能与他合作，但这种感觉不对。感觉就像他在驱赶某人，像是在强迫什么事情发生。

Whoever or whatever was in the cores also eluded him. There were two, that was certain, but who they were, what they were, was not. They slumbered, and retreated into themselves, almost like they were scared of functioning at all. He could feel some similarity with them, had he known them? Piloted in an Eva with them at one life or another? There was no time to figure those things out, so Shinji ignored them, pushing them to the back of his mind. As long as Unit-13 could move it wouldn't matter soon.  
无论是谁或是什么东西在核心里，他也捉摸不透。确实有两个，但他们的身份、本质，他一无所知。他们沉睡着，退缩进自己的内心，几乎像是害怕完全运作起来。他能感觉到与他们有些相似之处，难道他认识他们？在某一生中与他们一起驾驶过 Eva 吗？没有时间去弄清楚这些事情，所以真嗣忽略了他们，将他们推到脑海的角落。只要 13 号机能动，很快就不重要了。

The first steps went as well as they could. Like getting used to a new bicycle, it had a new feel, but it worked the same way. Shinji could feel the energy of Unit-13, he recognized it, there was a difference when an Evangelion had an S2 engine, and you never forgot that feeling. Now he had two at his disposal, what that meant he didn't know. In no time they were striding forwards to a cable and winch, which was positioned right next to a massive abyss.  
最初的步伐还算顺利。就像适应一辆新自行车，它有种新奇的感觉，但运作方式依旧。真嗣能感受到 13 号机的能量，他认得这种感觉，当一台 EVA 搭载 S2 引擎时，那种差异感是忘不掉的。现在他有两台可供驱使，这意味着什么他还不清楚。转眼间，他们便朝着一根电缆和绞车迈进，那设备就位于一个巨大的深渊旁。

"How does it feel?" Kaworu asked.  
“感觉如何？” 渚薰问道。

"Unnatural," Shinji replied, earning a snicker from his copilot.  
“不自然，” 真嗣回答，引来了副驾驶的一声轻笑。

"It's to be expected, I'm sure not even you have ever piloted an Evangelion like this before."  
"这在意料之中，我敢肯定你以前也从未驾驶过这样的 EVA。"

Reaching the edge, they stopped. "What are we waiting for?" Shinji asked.  
抵达边缘，他们停下了。“我们在等什么？”真嗣问道。

"Mark.09," Kaworu explained, "she'll be our backup."  
“Mark.09，”薰解释道，“她将是我们的后援。”

Just then Mark.09 appeared, Shinji observed the peculiar machine. It had solid limbs once more, but as they placed Unit-13's foot into the base hook of the cable, Shinji watched their companion's arm latch onto the cable, becoming liquified and attaching to it.  
就在这时，Mark.09 出现了，真嗣观察着这台奇特的机器。它的四肢再次变得坚固，但当他们将 13 号机的脚放入电缆的基础钩中时，真嗣看到同伴的手臂抓住电缆，液化并附着在上面。

"What's the deal with that?" Shinji asked.  
“那是什么情况？” 真嗣问道。

"Mark.09's limbs? They're a mimetic polyalloy capable of manifesting whatever shape is desired… though it requires a bit of an imagination. Not something found with copies." Kaworu explained, his head craning upwards, "The torso is relatively the same, the Lilin thought it would be a more efficient design, no limbs to fix, but it had too many flaws."  
“Mark.09 的四肢？它们是一种拟态聚合体合金，能够呈现任何所需的形状……虽然这需要一点想象力。复制体可不具备这种能力。”渚薰解释道，他的头向上仰起，“躯干相对而言是一样的，人类认为这种设计更高效，没有需要修复的肢体，但它存在太多缺陷。”

"So why is she here?"  
“那她为什么在这里？”

"Backup, in case anything happens."  
“作为后备，以防万一发生什么。”

"I'm sure we can handle ourselves, besides, what happens when we do what we came here for?" Shinji asked trying to avoid telegraphing their alternative plan.  
"我相信我们能照顾好自己，再说了，当我们完成来这里的目的后会发生什么呢？" 真嗣问道，试图避免透露他们的备用计划。

_Shinji could hear the snort from Soryu in the other entry plug.  
真嗣能听到另一边的插入栓里传来惣流的不屑声。_

"We'll be fine," Kaworu said reassuringly.  
"我们会没事的，" 薰安慰地说道。

Shinji shook his head, he was already beginning to regret this, but there was no turning back now as they crossed over from what had looked like NERV into a darker, unlit area. Kaworu activated a switch on his side and immediately lights on the EVA itself activated. Shinji would have made a mental note of how useful that could be plenty of times before, but he was simply too engrossed by what the lights revealed.  
真嗣摇了摇头，他已经开始后悔了，但现在已经没有回头路了，他们从看似是 NERV 的地方跨入了更黑暗、未被照亮的区域。薰在他身旁启动了一个开关，EVA 身上的灯光立刻亮起。真嗣本该多次记下这有多实用，但他完全被灯光揭示的景象吸引住了。

"The… walls…." Shinji stared at the mangled bodies of EVAs, all of which seemed like copies of Unit-01. They composed the wall, every one of them a deep crimson and all missing the same part, their head.  
“这…墙壁…”真嗣凝视着扭曲的 EVA 机体残骸，它们看起来都像是初号机的复制品。这些残骸构成了墙壁，每一具都深红如血，且都缺失了同一个部分——它们的头部。

"The remains of those who fell short of infinity," Kaworu said, but seemingly chose not to continue explaining.  
“那些未能触及无限者的遗骸，”薰说道，但似乎选择不再继续解释。

"We're almost at Lilith's seal, the main shaft is completely blocked by it," Kaworu said, looking over and down the shaft. "Not once in 10 years has it allowed anyone to pass it."  
“我们快到莉莉丝的封印了，主通道完全被它堵住了，”渚薰俯视着通道说道，“十年来，它从未让任何人通过。”

Shinji looked down, the 'seal' was just a sea of deep blue, not the most imposing thing he had ever gazed upon, but he was sure there was more to it than that.  
真嗣向下望去，那‘封印’只是一片深蓝的海洋，并非他所见过的最令人敬畏之物，但他确信其背后定有更深的含义。

A flurry of sounds raced through the entry plug, motors and computers seemed to spin up, adjusting the Evangelion for its main purpose.  
驾驶舱内响起一阵急促的声音，马达和计算机似乎开始加速运转，调整着福音战士以适应其主要任务。

"We'll need to be in sync," Kaworu stated, a look of determination on his face, "Just like playing the piano together."  
"我们需要同步，" 渚薰坚定地说道，脸上带着决心的表情，"就像一起弹钢琴一样。"

Well, that explained a lot.  
嗯，这解释了很多。

Shinji reached out, his senses working with Kaworu as one, and only then did he realize what they were doing. The seal he had seen was simply a massive AT field, and they were there to break through.  
真嗣伸出手，他的感知与渚薰合二为一，直到那时他才意识到他们在做什么。他看到的封印其实是一个巨大的 AT 力场，而他们的任务就是突破它。

As they touched the seal, he felt their own AT field slam into it, for a moment it resisted, but he reminded himself what he was doing here, why he had agreed to this, he would not be denied his chance at redemption. With that thought the field gave away, crumbling against the onslaught, Shinji felt it shatter like glass, and as they lowered he witnessed the deep blue crack and break, falling down around them and turning to dust.  
当他们触碰到封印时，他感受到自己的 AT 力场猛烈撞击上去，一时间它抗拒着，但他提醒自己为何来到这里，为何同意这样做，他不会被剥夺赎回的机会。带着这个念头，力场屈服了，在猛攻下崩溃，真嗣感觉它像玻璃一样破碎，随着他们下降，他目睹深蓝色裂开并破裂，围绕着他们坠落并化为尘埃。

"There," Shinji said taking a deep breath, "we did it." Shinji looked over the other entry plug. Not to see Kaworu, instead, he looked at Asuka.  
“好了，”真嗣深吸一口气说道，“我们做到了。”真嗣看向另一台插入栓。不是为了看渚薰，而是看向了明日香。

_Soryu could feel his eyes on her, and she turned to meet his gaze but said nothing.  
惣流能感觉到他的目光落在她身上，她转身迎上他的视线，但什么也没说。_

A twig of pain went through him, but he looked back down. His goal was within reach, and she would understand.  
一阵痛楚掠过心头，但他再次垂下目光。目标近在咫尺，她会理解的。

"The lowest level of Terminal Dogma…." Kaworu said, "The epicenter of the Third Impact."  
“最终教条区最底层……”渚薰说道，“第三次冲击的震源。”

The room he was expecting was non-existent, Shinji's eyes widened at the sight of Lilith, or what was left of her. The rotting corpse of a fallen god rested on its hands and knees, the cross it had been confined to had collapsed as if to make a mockery of a church's nave.  
他预想中的房间并不存在，真嗣的眼睛因看到莉莉丝——或者说她残存的部分——而瞪大了。一具腐烂的神之尸骸以手膝支撑着地面，束缚她的十字架已然崩塌，仿佛在嘲弄教堂的中殿。

"I take it that's Mark.06?" Shinji asked, spying a smaller pale figure on top of Lilith, a spear through its chest.  
"我猜那是 6 号机？" 真嗣问道，目光落在一个较小的苍白身影上，那身影正位于莉莉丝之上，胸口被长矛贯穿。

"Yes, what's left of it."  
"是的，仅存的部分。"

Shinji felt the cable lurch to a halt, and let go, leaving Unit-13 to fall the last way to the ground with a thundering crash. Only once they reached the ground did he realize what it was made from, Unit-13 was standing on a mountain of skulls.  
真嗣感到缆绳猛地一停，便松开了手，让十三号机轰然坠地。直到他们落地后，他才意识到十三号机所站立的，竟是一座骷髅堆成的小山。

He closed his eyes, not even wanting to know why they were here, instead he pushed the Evangelion forwards, towards their, no, his goal. With every step, the ground shook, a testament to how massive Unit-13 was.  
他闭上双眼，甚至不愿知晓他们为何来此，只是推动着福音战士向前，朝着他们的，不，他的目标前进。每迈出一步，大地都为之震颤，这正是十三号机庞大身躯的明证。

"Cassius and Longinus." Kaworu breathed, peering up at the spears, which they now had a better view of.  
"卡西乌斯与朗基努斯。" 渚薰轻声说道，抬头凝视着那两柄长矛，现在他们能更清楚地观察它们了。

"Wait." Shinji squinted, the familiar deep red was present on one of them, the spear that was driven through Mark.06, but the other, was black just like the replicas of the MPEs.  
"等等。" 真嗣眯起眼睛，其中一柄上熟悉的深红色映入眼帘，正是贯穿 Mark.06 的那支，但另一柄，却如 MPEs 的复制品般漆黑。

"Is it supposed to look like that?" Shinji asked, pointing to the second spear.  
"它应该是这样的吗？" 真嗣指着第二柄长矛问道。

Kaworu leaned forwards, bringing his hand up to his chin, "No… not at all… hold on a second…"  
渚薰向前倾身，抬起手托住下巴，“不……完全不是……等一下……”

As the words left his mouth the ground around them exploded.  
话音刚落，他们周围的地面就爆炸了。

ʡʘʘʘʢ

_G-forces pushed her body into the seat as the rocket motors delivered millions of newtons of force propelling her upwards. She didn't have to do anything as computers onboard managed millions of calculations per second to steer her vessel toward the heavens.  
火箭发动机释放出数百万牛顿的推力，将她的身体压向座椅。她无需做任何事，因为船上的计算机每秒处理数百万次计算，引导她的飞船向着天空飞去。_

_After 45 seconds of being crushed into her seat, it all suddenly evaporated, as the sky above her turned dark and the Greek cross around her neck floated into her vision.  
在被紧紧压在座位上 45 秒后，一切突然消失了，天空在她上方变得昏暗，她脖子上的希腊十字架飘入了她的视线。_

_Asuka adjusted her helmet, annoyed by its ability to hinder her view, though the projected view from inside the entry plug wasn't real, a bright white overlay with data was supposed to keep her from being disorientated instead. She said nothing as voices came through over comms, altitude goals reached, orbital velocity attained, she wasn't needed for any of that.  
明日香调整了她的头盔，对其妨碍视线的能力感到恼火，尽管插入栓内的投影并非真实，本应有一层明亮的白色数据覆盖层来防止她迷失方向。她没有说话，当通讯中传来声音，高度目标达成，轨道速度获得，她并不需要参与其中。_

"_Commence Operation US." Misato's voice came through her helmet._  
“开始执行 US 作战。”美里通过头盔传来指令。

_A flurry of commands came again, this time initiating a retro burn and she felt another jolt go through her as sections of the craft broke away, empty mass jettisoned. Another retro burn, another jolt, she gripped the controls, waiting for mission control to disable remote guidance and return to local control.  
一连串指令再次传来，这次启动了反向燃烧，她感到飞船各部分分离时又是一阵震动，空载质量被抛出。又一次反向燃烧，又一次震动，她紧握控制器，等待任务控制中心解除远程引导，切换回本地控制。_

_Her heart rate quickened at the callout, and she felt the feedback in her controls as she grasped them tighter.  
听到呼叫，她的心跳加速，她更紧地握住控制器，感受到反馈。_

_T- 80 seconds to contact.  
接触前 80 秒。_

"_Pod 2 prepare for rendezvous, Pod 8 has insufficient altitude and can only provide backup for 96 seconds before reentry."_  
二号舱准备会合，八号舱高度不足，仅能在重返大气层前提供 96 秒的支援。

_If only the target's orbit had decayed as much as they'd hoped or if Four-Eyes' boosters had been more efficient. It looked like she would have to do this alone again.  
要是目标轨道衰减得如他们所愿，或是四眼仔的助推器效率更高些就好了。看来她又得独自完成任务了。_

_Her field of view lit up with warnings and alarms sounded inside the entry plug. The N2 mines would be detonating any second now, sending kinetic penetrators in every direction, but she was ready. She held her breath as a jolt went through the entry plug, but her AT field held, now the tricky part.  
她的视野中亮起了警告，驾驶舱内警报声大作。N2 地雷随时可能引爆，向四面八方发射动能穿透弹，但她已做好准备。她屏住呼吸，驾驶舱传来一阵震动，但她的 AT 力场稳住了，现在才是棘手的部分。_

"_second wave incoming, Pattern blue, confirmed as Code 4a."_  
"第二波来袭，蓝色模式，确认为代码 4a。"

_The impact was different this time, and immediately she knew what was happening, the sickening feeling of an Anti-AT field tearing through her own. It made her skin crawl, her stomach twisted and she gripped the controls tighter as she felt the shield guarding Unit-02 be struck directly by the annoyance's projectiles.  
这次冲击有所不同，她立刻明白了发生了什么，那种令人作呕的反 AT 力场穿透她自身的感觉。这让她浑身发麻，胃部翻腾，她紧紧抓住控制器，感觉到保护二号机的护盾直接被那烦人的投射物击中。_

"_Well aren't you a little prick!" Asuka growled, her hand reaching up to her helmet, if she had to fight, then she wasn't going to handicap herself._  
“哼，你还真是个小刺头！”明日香低吼道，手伸向头盔，如果非得动手，她可不会自缚手脚。

"_Four-Eyes Crony!" Asuka shouted, maneuvering her thrusters to dodge a hail of incoming fire, "Where's my cover fire!? You're two seconds late!"_  
"四眼跟班！" 明日香喊道，操纵着推进器躲避密集的炮火，"我的掩护火力呢？你晚了整整两秒！"

"_then you shouldn't move into position three seconds early." A somewhat smug voice came through her comms._  
"那你就别提前三秒进入位置。" 通讯器里传来一个略带得意的声音。"

"_Improvise!"_ "随机应变！"

"_The princess beckons. Your noble wish is my command." Mari replied as a Mark.4a unit exploded in front of her._  
“公主召唤，您的崇高愿望即是我之使命。”玛丽回应道，与此同时，一台 Mark.4a 单位在她面前爆炸。

_Asuka gripped the controls tighter as she felt her thrusters fire to avoid debris and damage, "I've cleared the Fullerene Shift, breaching final defenses, area 89."  
明日香紧握操纵杆，感受到推进器启动以躲避碎片和损伤，“我已穿越富勒烯跃迁，突破最终防线，区域 89。”_

_Her lip curled slightly, almost according to plan, but that thought was cut short.  
她的嘴角微微上扬，几乎按计划进行，但这个念头转瞬即逝。_

"_The target object is moving! Orbital correction can't keep up! I'm going to go for broke!"_  
目标物体正在移动！轨道修正跟不上了！我要全力以赴了！

_Asuka braced herself as she was thrown around in her seat by her maneuvering thrusters doing their best to keep her on course, but she knew it wouldn't be enough.  
明日香紧抓座椅，被操纵推进器猛烈摇晃，竭力维持航向，但她清楚这远远不够。_

"_Orbital correction can't keep up! I'm gonna go for broke!" She shouted, as Unit-02 lined up its arm and fired a salvo of grappling hooks. Her indicators turned green, meaning she was locked onto the object, but now was the hard part._  
“轨道修正跟不上了！我要全力以赴了！”她大喊着，二号机瞄准目标，发射了一连串的抓钩。指示灯转为绿色，意味着已锁定目标，但真正的挑战才刚刚开始。

_She watched the cables go slack as Unit-02 got closer and finally flew by her target. Suddenly she was thrown backwards as all her energy was dumped rendezvousing with the target and sending them spinning around each other.  
她看着缆绳逐渐松弛，当二号机接近并最终掠过目标时，突然间她被猛地向后抛去，所有能量在会合目标时倾泻而出，使两者围绕彼此旋转起来。_

_The g-load was sustained, and she knew it would take time for the thrusters to correct for it, so she wasn't worried when the edges of her vision started to go black. She started to worry when the darkness grew.  
重力负荷持续着，她知道推进器需要时间来调整，所以当视野边缘开始变黑时，她并不担心。但当黑暗蔓延开来时，她开始感到不安。_

"_C'mon Asuka." She mumbled, disregarding the warnings blaring in front of her._  
“加油，明日香。”她喃喃自语，无视眼前响起的警告。

_Her vision dwindled, the darkness consuming all but a pinprick of the light.  
她的视野逐渐缩小，黑暗吞噬了除了一丝微光外的所有光明。_

"_Yoo traint or is'."_  "哟，训练还是休息？"

A redheaded woman in a white jack leaned down in front of her, a clipboard in hand, her abysmal score was probably on there. "What's the matter Asuka, do you not like the centrifuge?"  
一位红发女子身着白色夹克俯身在她面前，手中拿着一个剪贴板，上面很可能记录着她糟糕的成绩。“怎么了，明日香，你不喜欢离心机吗？”

"_Asuka! Asuka report!"_ "明日香！明日香，报告！"

_Her eye shot open, the target encompassed all of her view, and the sound of explosive bolts going off behind her filled her senses. She must have triggered the deceleration burn without remembering it, the benefits of Katsuragi's excessive training.  
她的眼睛猛地睁开，目标占据了她的全部视野，爆炸螺栓启动的声音充斥着她的感官。她一定是无意识中触发了减速燃烧，这都得益于葛城那过度的训练。_

"_Deceleration burn complete." She mumbled out between labored breaths, "Target seized and secured ready to return."_  
“减速燃烧完成。”她喘着粗气喃喃自语，“目标已捕获并固定，准备返回。”

"_Roger. We'll be waiting at the retrieval point, rendezvous code is Saturn Five."_  
“收到。我们将在回收点等待，会合代码是土星五号。”

"_Roger that."_ "收到。"

_Just as she collapsed into her seat, an rang out and an alert exploded onto her screen indicating a pattern blue.  
就在她瘫坐在座位上的那一刻，一声铃响，屏幕上弹出一条警报，显示出现了一种蓝色模式。_

"_A pattern blue? Where's it coming from?" she shouted, looking around her for any sign of the attacker._  
"蓝色模式？它从哪儿来的？" 她大声喊道，环顾四周寻找攻击者的任何迹象。

_Asuka watched as one of the cubes on the opposite side of the tesseract opened, unfolding hundreds of times into four ribbons. Her stomach sank as the ribbons swirled around her, what was this thing?  
明日香注视着对面超正方体的一个立方体打开，展开成数百次，形成四条缎带。缎带在她周围旋转，她的胃沉了下去，这是什么东西？_

"_You've got to be kidding! We're just about to attempt reentry here!" Asuka looked over her shoulder, scanning for her wingman against the red earth below. "Four-eyed crony! Cover me!"_  
"你一定是在开玩笑吧！我们正准备尝试重返大气层呢！" 明日香回头望去，在下方红色的地球背景下寻找她的僚机。"四眼跟班！掩护我！"

"_No can do, I've got insufficient altitude, I can't engage," Mari responded, the end of her message crackling from the disruption of reentry._  
"不行啊，我的高度不够，无法参与，" 玛丽回应道，她的消息结尾因重返大气层的干扰而发出噼啪声。

"_Useless!" Asuka growled, trying to stick Unit-02s foot around the tesseract and stomp the core, "This wasn't part of the briefing!"_  
"没用的！" 明日香咆哮着，试图用二号机的脚缠住超立方体并踩碎核心，"这不在简报内容里！"

_Around her, the ribbons that had unfolded began to glow and she only had a second to throw up her AT field. As the light intensified, a sharp pain manifested in her arm as the light concentrated on her left arm, the only thing keeping her connected to the tesseract.  
在她周围，展开的缎带开始发光，她只有一瞬间的时间张开 AT 力场。随着光芒的增强，她的手臂传来一阵剧痛，光芒集中在她的左臂上，这是唯一连接她和超立方体的地方。_

_Asuka hissed in pain as warning blared around her, her angle of descent was too high, her and her target were losing more and more control every moment. She figured at this rate they'd both burn up in the atmosphere.  
明日香痛苦地嘶声叫喊，警报声在她周围响起，她的下降角度过高，她和目标每分每秒都在失去越来越多的控制。她估计照这样下去，她们俩都会在大气层中烧毁。_

"_Operation objective has top priority, do not release the target object even if it means losing the EVA!"_  
"任务目标优先级最高，即使牺牲 EVA 也不能释放目标对象！"

"_You don't think I know that already!" She shouted back, that was just like the cold Katsuragi she had come to know._  
"你以为我不知道吗！"她回吼道，这正是她所熟悉的冷酷的葛城。

_As soon as that exchange ended, her arm exploded in pain as Unit-02's appendage was finally torn apart by the light concentrated on it.  
话音刚落，她的手臂便传来一阵剧痛，二号机的肢体终于被那束集中在其上的光芒撕裂开来。_

_Tearing into the metal shell, she held onto the tesseract with all her strength even as the ribbons again flared with light. Explosions surrounded her as both the object and she were bombarded while her AT field was useless against whatever was attacking her.  
她用力撕开金属外壳，紧紧抓住魔方，即便光带再次闪耀光芒。爆炸在她周围肆虐，她和物体一同遭受轰炸，她的 AT 力场对正在攻击她的未知力量毫无作用。_

_The world spun as she started to fall into the atmosphere, she was out of time, but all the girl could do now was focus on keeping her grip on the tesseract. She tried to ignore the excruciating pain in her arm by instead focusing on the only thing she could think of to distract her. The occupant of her target.  
世界在她坠入大气层时旋转，她已没有时间，但此刻女孩唯一能做的就是集中精力保持对魔方的抓握。她试图通过专注于唯一能想到的分散注意力的对象来忽略手臂上剧烈的疼痛。她的目标中的存在。_

_She didn't know where the words came from, perhaps it was the memories of them together, how he seemed to solve every problem with ease, how he would know exactly what to do right now. The words came out before she even comprehend what she was saying.  
她不知道这些话从何而来，或许是他们在一起的记忆，他似乎总能轻松解决问题，他现在一定知道该怎么做。这些话脱口而出，她甚至还没完全理解自己在说什么。_

"_C'mon do something, anything Idiot Shinji!"_  
"快点做点什么，什么都行，笨蛋真嗣！"

_As the words left her mouth, her sight was awash in violet light.  
话音刚落，她的视野便被一片紫光淹没。_

_She felt an AT field expand outwards from the sarcophagus carrying Unit-01, the purple light growing, slicing the tendrils that had grown from her mission's objective. She opened her eyes to witness it find the core and for a surge of energy to destroy it.  
她感觉到从装载着初号机的石棺中向外扩展出一个 AT 力场，紫光愈发强烈，切断了从她的任务目标中生长出的触须。她睁开眼睛，目睹着那股能量找到核心并爆发摧毁了它。_

_The Nemesis series had no hope of resisting such an onslaught, it couldn't even slow it down. The core detonated in a magnificent cross-shaped blast, rocking Unit-02 one last time as Asuka collapsed back into her seat, her good eye wide open, and her body numb.  
Nemesis 系列在如此猛烈的攻势下毫无抵抗之力，甚至连减缓其速度都做不到。核心以壮观的十字形爆炸终结，最后一次震撼了二号机，而明日香瘫坐在驾驶舱内，她那只完好的眼睛瞪得大大的，身体却已麻木。_

ʡʘʘʘʢ

The operation had changed and Asuka wondered why they didn't just take Wunder in guns blazing.  
行动方案已经变更，明日香不禁疑惑为何他们不直接以火力全开的方式登上 Wunder 号。

The access tunnels they had planned to use for such a situation like this had degraded extensively. Cave-ins, eroded corized metal, it all left them playing a guessing game.  
他们原本计划在这种情况下使用的通道已经严重退化。塌方、腐蚀的金属，一切都让他们如同在猜谜游戏中摸索。

Each turn was relayed back to Wunder, whose crew was doing its best to guide them and if necessary track them on GPS location to get them closer to NERV HQ. Though the quality of the signal was degrading more and more.  
每一步行动都会反馈回 Wunder 号，其船员正尽最大努力引导他们，并在必要时通过 GPS 定位帮助他们接近 NERV 总部。尽管信号质量越来越差。

"Power at 33 percent," Asuka said, slowing Unit-02 down so Mari could catch up.  
"功率 33%," 明日香说道，减缓了二号机的速度以便真希波能跟上。

"Make sure you're topped up, we don't know what we'll be meeting," Mari said, handing the connector cable to Unit-02, who set down both her spears and snapped it into its back for rapid recharging.  
"确保电量充足，我们不知道会遇到什么，" 真希波说着，将连接电缆递给二号机，后者放下双矛，迅速将其插入背部进行快速充电。

"How close are we?" Asuka asked, but received no answer, it looked like they were on their own now.  
"我们还有多远？" 明日香问道，但没有得到回答，看起来现在只能靠他们自己了。

"We can't be far," Mari said, interrupted as they both snapped around, "tell me you felt that too?"  
"我们不会离得太远，" 真希说道，突然被打断，两人同时转身，"告诉我你也感觉到了吧？"

Asuka's eye narrowed, it was the most powerful AT field she had ever felt. One had just collided with another, and it was clear there was a winner. Instantly she grabbed her spears and took off, Mari alongside her, weaving through the crumbling tunnels and using that AT field as a beacon.  
明日香的眼睛眯了起来，这是她所感受到的最强大的 AT 力场。两个力场刚刚发生了碰撞，显然有一方胜出了。她立刻抓起长矛，疾驰而去，真希紧随其后，穿梭在崩塌的隧道中，将那个 AT 力场作为指引的灯塔。

"It's right here!" Asuka said, turning a corner, only to find a dead end.  
"就在这里！" 明日香说着，转过一个拐角，却只发现了一堵死路。

She moved forwards slowly, it was beyond the wall, she was sure of it.  
她缓缓向前移动，她确信那是在墙的另一边。

"Send an explosive round." Asuka moved back, setting down the second spear and clearing the shot for Mari.  
“发射爆炸弹。”明日香后退一步，放下第二支矛，为真里腾出射击空间。

"As you wish your highness," Mari said, raiding the rifle and racking the bolt.  
“如您所愿，殿下，”真里说道，迅速拿起步枪并拉动枪栓。

Asuka had underestimated the cloud of dust obscuring everything, but charged ahead nonetheless, her heart skipping a beat as she plummeted down into what she came to realize was Terminal Dogma.  
明日香低估了那片遮天蔽日的尘埃，但她依旧勇往直前，心跳加速地坠入了她逐渐意识到的那片名为“终端教条”的区域。

That meant… 这意味着……

As she landed, she saw the two other figures present. She recognized Mark.09, but it was standing a distance away, the closer EVA was clearly the one they had been drawn to, likely the one housing the S2 engine.  
当她落地时，她看到了另外两个身影。她认出了 Mark.09，但它站在远处，而更近的 EVA 显然是他们被吸引来的那一个，很可能就是搭载了 S2 引擎的那台。

The first thing that struck her was how similar it looked compared to Unit-01. It was clearly a darker shade, but the largest difference was the size. It towered above any EVA she had seen, but that wouldn't stop her.  
首先让她震惊的是它与零一单元有多么相似。显然颜色更深，但最大的区别在于尺寸。它比她见过的任何 EVA 都要高大，但这并不会阻止她。

She launched herself into the air, lunging at the Evangelion with her double spear. Just as she was about to land the blow, its arm reached out, and an AT field flared, stopping her strike in its tracks.  
她腾空而起，双矛直指福音战士。就在她即将击中之际，对方手臂一伸，AT 力场骤然爆发，将她的攻击生生止住。

"Unit-02?" The voice came through her comms, and all feeling drained from her body. Her eyes shifted to the face of Shinji Ikari as it appeared on the screen in front of her.  
“二号机？”通讯器中传来声音，她全身的力气仿佛瞬间被抽空。目光转向屏幕上显现的碇真嗣的面孔。

She didn't notice the dark plugsuit he wore, nor the strange A-10 clips, no, the first thing that came to mind when she saw his face was how tired he looked. The boy looked terrible like he hadn't slept in ages, dark circles under his eyes had formed and his face fell after the shock of seeing her through their comm link.  
她没有注意到他身上那件深色的连体服，也没有留意到那奇怪的 A-10 夹子，不，当她看到他的脸时，首先浮现在脑海的是他看起来多么疲惫。男孩看上去糟透了，仿佛许久未曾合眼，眼下的黑圈清晰可见，在通过通讯链接看到她后，他的脸色更是瞬间黯淡下来。

She jumped back, away from the massive Evangelion. Her body was numb, and her mouth hung open. "What the hell are you doing in an EVA?!" Asuka shouted.  
她向后一跃，远离那庞大的福音战士。她的身体麻木，嘴巴张开。“你到底在 EVA 里做什么？！”明日香大喊。

He said nothing for a moment, then took a deep breath and closed his eyes, "Asuka, I can change everything, it'll be better I swear, we'll never need to pilot ever again." He explained. "Let me do this! Please! It'll all be over!"  
他沉默了一会儿，然后深吸一口气，闭上眼睛，“明日香，我能改变一切，我发誓会变得更好，我们再也不需要驾驶了。”他解释道。“让我这么做吧！求你了！一切都会结束的！”

The way he said it made it sound so sincere like he believed the words he said and it was entrancing for her, she wanted to believe those words.  
他说这话的方式听起来如此真诚，仿佛他真的相信自己说的话，这让她着迷，她想要相信那些话。

But she couldn't. 但她做不到。

Not after everything. 在经历了这一切之后。

She had imagined a boy in a cell, defiant against his father, biding his time as he knew she would come for him. Finally, it would be her who would rescue him and the two of them would finally have their proper reunion. Instead, here he was, in an EVA, prepared to continue his father's work.  
她曾幻想一个男孩在牢房中，对抗他的父亲，等待时机，因为他知道她会来救他。最终，将是她来拯救他，他们两人将迎来真正的重逢。然而，他现在却在这里，驾驶着 EVA，准备继续他父亲的事业。

Suddenly her body was no longer numb, it was shaking, and rage flared in her. He was here, with NERV, with his father. Mari, Misato, they were all right to doubt him.  
突然间，她的身体不再麻木，而是颤抖起来，怒火在她心中燃起。他在这里，与 NERV，与他的父亲在一起。真希波，美里，她们怀疑他都是对的。

It was all a lie.  
这一切都是谎言。

"HAVEN'T YOU CHANGED IT ENOUGH?!" She lunged at him, the spear she held aimed right for center mass, but it never landed. She had forgotten about Mark.09, whose scythe was coming straight down on her as she landed.  
“你还没改够吗？！”她向他扑去，手中的长矛直指胸膛，但并未击中。她忘了 Mark.09，当她落地时，它的镰刀正直直劈下。

Her AT field flared, but the strike never landed, instead it was Mark.09 who was sent flying, as the violet figure of the massive Evangelion stood in its place.  
她的 AT 力场猛然爆发，但攻击并未落下，反而是 Mark.09 被击飞，紫色巨影的福音战士屹立其位。

"Get away from her!" she heard him shout.  
“离她远点！”她听见他大喊。

Why? What was his game? Why did he have to do this to her?  
为何？他在玩什么把戏？为何非要这样对她？

"Just…" she wanted to say something, anything, curse him, hate him, but a piece was fighting against it. There was one part of her that wouldn't be overtaken, one piece that would not give in to her anger. It stood alone, against the storm of pain and fury building in her.  
"只是…" 她想说些什么，任何话，咒骂他，憎恨他，但内心有一部分却在抗拒。她有一部分不会被征服，有一部分不愿屈服于愤怒。它孤独地站立，对抗着在她内心肆虐的痛苦和愤怒风暴。

It was the piece of her that still loved him.  
那是她依然爱着他的那部分。

And no matter how hard she tried, it refused to die.  
无论她如何努力，这部分爱意就是不肯消逝。

It did not, however, keep her from releasing that pain towards him.  
然而，这并未阻止她将那份痛苦向他释放。

ʡʘʘʘʢ

"Our source's information was right," Fuyutsuki mumbled, observing the fight occurring in Terminal Dogma on the screen.  
“我们的线人情报准确无误，”冬月喃喃自语，观察着屏幕上终端教条区发生的战斗。

WILLE was a nuisance, but not a true threat, their informant always allowed them to be one step ahead. The flashes of color lit up his face in the darkroom as he waited for Gendo to finish his speech to the last members of SEELE.  
WILLE 虽是个麻烦，但并非真正的威胁，他们的内线总能使他们领先一步。在昏暗的房间里，随着颜色的闪烁，他等待着碇源堂向 SEELE 最后成员发表演讲。

The men would die, that was certain. They never realized the leverage the both of them could gain over them should they ever discover where they were in the Americas.  
那些人必死无疑，这是肯定的。他们从未意识到，一旦发现他们在美洲的藏身之处，两人将能对他们施加多大的影响力。

The beauty of it all was they didn't have to lift a finger, already Coalition forces were scrambling to dispose of the last of those who ruined this world.  
这一切的美妙之处在于，他们无需动一根手指，联合军已经忙不迭地着手清除那些毁掉这个世界的最后残余。

The elderly man leaned back and closed his eyes. Finally, Yui would be avenged, and the men who started this madness, the ones who wished to achieve godhood would die as mortal men.  
老人向后靠去，闭上了眼睛。终于，Yui 的仇将得报，那些引发这场疯狂、妄图成神的男人，将作为凡人死去。

As he opened his eyes and watched Unit-13 shove Unit-02 away from itself, he wondered if the boy would ever achieve a similar fate.  
当他睁开眼，看着 13 号机将 02 号机推开时，他不禁思索，那少年是否也会迎来同样的命运。

ʡʘʘʘʢ

Shinji blocked her strike, the double-bladed spear slamming against his AT field. His entry plug was filled with the war cries of the girl he had known and it was becoming more and more obvious she wasn't in control of herself. Each strike was less precise, less calculated. He winced at every sound, she hated him and he had done this to her.  
真嗣挡下了她的攻击，双刃矛猛击在他的 AT 力场上。他的插入栓内充满了那个他所认识的女孩的战斗呼喊，而她越来越明显地失去了自我控制。每一次攻击都愈发不精确，不再经过计算。他对每一个声音都感到痛苦，她恨他，而他正是这一切的始作俑者。

"I'm sorry Asuka." He said, grabbing the wrist of Unit-02, swiping at her, and throwing her to the side. "I'll make this right."  
“对不起，明日香。”他说着，抓住了二号机的手腕，猛地一挥将她甩到一旁。“我会纠正这一切。”

"Mari was right, you are insane!" She shouted, pushing herself up, "Nothing good can come from working with your father!"  
“玛丽说得对，你真是疯了！”她喊道，挣扎着起身，“和你父亲合作绝不会有好结果！”

She tried again to strike him, as the sounds of shots pinning Mark.9 behind her continued, but no matter what she did, Shinji would not give her an opening. He was just as good as the last day they spared, despite whatever had a hold on him, whether it was NERV brainwashing, the time spent in the core, or this was how he always was, he was still an expert fighter.  
她再次试图攻击他，与此同时，子弹击中 Mark.9 的声音在她身后持续响起，但无论她怎么做，真嗣就是不给她任何破绽。他和上次训练时一样出色，无论他是被 NERV 洗脑了，还是在核心中度过的时光，抑或他本就如此，他始终是一位战斗专家。

"Asuka. Enough." Shinji said, his voice even, but she didn't care.  
“明日香，够了。”真嗣说道，语气平静，但她并不在意。

He watched her thrust the spear forwards, clearly expecting him to block it with this AT field, but instead he let it through, enough for her to lose balance, before closing it once again.  
他看着她将长矛向前刺出，显然是预料到他会用 AT 力场来阻挡，但他却任由长矛穿过，直到她失去平衡，才再次闭合力场。

Unit-02 stumbled backwards, looking at the spear now sliced in half.  
02 号机踉跄后退，望着那已被劈成两半的长矛。

"You can't win against me Asuka, you know that." He said, hating his own words, but saying them regardless.  
“你赢不了我的，明日香，你知道这一点。”他说道，尽管厌恶自己的话，但还是说了出来。

It was true, even on an even playing field his experience was well above her. She probably had years more experience now, he was even willing to bet she could do things he'd never see, but his experience was on a different scale entirely.  
确实如此，即便在公平的竞技场上，他的经验也远超于她。她现在或许多了几年经验，他甚至愿意打赌她能做到一些他从未见识过的事情，但他的经验完全是另一个层次。

"JUST SHUT UP ALREADY!" She yelled, flipping what was left of the spear around and launching into the air.  
“你就不能闭嘴吗！”她吼道，将剩下的矛杆一转，腾空而起。

A round exploded next to Unit-13, causing him to lose balance, long enough for Asuka to land a strike without his AT field. But Shinji caught the blades, stifling a hiss as the pain shot through his hands.  
一颗炮弹在 13 号机旁爆炸，使他失去平衡，足够让明日香趁机在没有 AT 力场的情况下发动攻击。但真嗣抓住了刀刃，随着疼痛从双手传来，他倒吸了一口凉气。

"Asuka, this is idiotic," he twisted Unit-13's hands, snapping the blade and dropping Unit-02, whose body suddenly became limp.  
“明日香，这太愚蠢了，”他扭动 13 号机的双手，折断刀刃并让 2 号机坠落，其身体随即瘫软下来。

"You've got to be kidding me, four-eyed cronie, the spear!"  
"你一定是在开玩笑吧，四眼老兄，那把矛！"

"Asuka…" Shinji spoke up, grabbing her attention. That blue eye looked at him through the screen with such hatred, such pain. All he could do now was tell her the truth.  
"明日香……" 真嗣开口了，吸引了她的注意。那只蓝色的眼睛透过屏幕看向他，充满了恨意和痛苦。现在他唯一能做的就是告诉她真相。

He took Unit-02's limp body into his arms, leading its gently to the ground "I'm not going to destroy the world." He explained, "I know what Instrumentality is, what it feels like, and I'm never going to let that happen again. I need you to know that."  
他将二号机的无力身躯抱入怀中，轻轻地将其引向地面。“我不会毁灭世界。”他解释道，“我知道什么是人类补完计划，它是什么感觉，我绝不会再让它发生。我需要你知道这一点。”

The anger he had seen on her face now morphed to confusion as he set Unit-02 on the ground. He willed Unit-13 to its feet, turning and making his way to the corpse of Lilith. Behind him, he heard the crash of something and in turning to look back, he could see it was the spear Asuka had asked for, but he just quicked his pace, he didn't need to fight anymore.  
他看到她脸上的怒气此刻变成了困惑，当他将二号机放在地上时。他让十三号机站起身，转身向莉莉丝的尸体走去。身后，他听到有什么东西倒下的声音，回头一看，发现是明日香要的那把长矛，但他只是加快了脚步，他不再需要战斗了。

"So you were going to let me fight alone back there?" Shinji glared at Kaworu in the second cockpit as Unit-13 finally began to crawl up the pale body of Lilith. His co-pilot was hunched forwards, his hands folded under his chin and deep in thought. Truthfully it hadn't bothered him, the lack of a second input had made things easier and he'd rather it was him who fought Asuka and kept her from truly getting hurt.  
“所以你打算让我一个人在那里战斗吗？”真嗣在十三号机的第二驾驶舱里瞪着渚薰，十三号机终于开始攀爬莉莉丝苍白的身躯。他的副驾驶向前蜷缩，双手托着下巴，深思熟虑。说实话，这并没有困扰他，缺少第二个输入反而让事情变得简单，他宁愿自己与明日香战斗，以免她真的受伤。

"I'm… not certain about this Shinji…" Kaworu said, turning.  
“我……不太确定，真嗣……”渚薰转过身来说。

"What?!" Shinji gawked, turning his concentration back and forth from Kaworu to his climbing, "What the hell are you talking about? You told me this would work!"  
"什么？！" 真嗣瞪大了眼睛，目光在渚薰和他攀爬的动作之间来回切换，"你到底在说什么鬼话？你告诉我这会成功的！"

"You don't get it…" Kaworu said as Shinji crested the top of Lilith, "The dark spear… it isn't right!"  
"你不明白……" 当真嗣登上莉莉丝的顶端时，渚薰说道，"那黑暗之矛……它不对劲！"

"Then we'll find the right one next!" Shinji growled, his anger flaring as he pushed Unit-13 forwards, "This is the only reason I'm in this damn thing!"  
"那我们下次就找到对的！" 真嗣咆哮着，怒火中烧地推动着 13 号机前进，"这是我穿上这该死的东西的唯一理由！"

He willed Unit-13 forwards, only to feel the cockpit lurch sideways.  
他命令 13 号单位前进，却只感到驾驶舱猛地侧倾。

"The control system!" Kaworu gasped.  
"控制系统！" 渚薰惊呼道。

"You gave me a way home, a way to end this!" Shinji shouted, "We can take them for ourselves, to keep from my father!"  
"你给了我回家的路，结束这一切的方法！" 真嗣喊道，"我们可以夺取它们，为了摆脱我父亲！"

"Shinji no!" "真嗣，不要！"

As he reached the spears his stomach twisted, and stopped himself as he tried to place the feeling overcoming him. Unit-13 shuttered, something had changed now that they were so close, but what?  
当他伸手去拿长矛时，胃部一阵痉挛，他试图抑制住那种突如其来的感觉。Unit-13 颤抖着，现在他们如此接近，有些事情已经改变了，但究竟是什么呢？

It finally struck him, the Evangelion felt dead. He tried to reach out to whatever was in the core, but nothing happened, he tried moving Unit-13, but it didn't respond. Finally, he placed the feeling, the helplessness, something he had forgotten.  
他终于意识到，这部福音战士感觉已经死寂。他试图触及核心中的存在，却毫无反应，他尝试操控十三号机，但它毫无动静。最终，他感受到了那种感觉，那种无助，一种他早已遗忘的情绪。

_Unit-01 tore Unit-04's arms from its torso, the red spray coating the surrounding buildings and fields as he felt himself pulverize Toji's Evangelion.  
初号机从躯干上撕裂了四号机的双臂，鲜红的喷溅覆盖了周围的建筑和田野，他感到自己在碾碎了 Toji 的福音战士。_

He was no longer in control and there was no way to fight whatever was controlling Unit-13.  
他不再能控制自己，也没有办法对抗控制十三号机的任何东西。

This didn't feel like a dummy plug based on Ayanami, he was sure of that, could it be built into Unit-13 itself? Then who was it based on? Whatever it was, Shinji had never encountered something like this before and he was sure it was just another surprise he had his father to thank for.  
这感觉不像是以绫波为基础的模拟插件，他确信这一点，难道是内置在十三号机本身？那么它是基于谁的呢？无论是什么，真嗣从未遇到过这样的事情，他确信这只是他父亲给他的又一个惊喜。

"Kaworu what's going on?!" He shouted, but he just sat there, head in his hands, useless.  
“薰，发生什么事了？！”他喊道，但薰只是坐在那里，双手抱头，毫无用处。

Unit-13 started walking forwards, its body moving on its own, but it wasn't going berserk. Shinji reached out again, to both cored, desperately trying to make some connection. If he was going to have a chance he needed them.  
13 号机开始向前走去，它的身体自行移动，但并未陷入狂暴。真嗣再次伸出手，同时触碰两个核心，拼命试图建立某种联系。如果他有机会，他需要它们。

But whoever they were, they refused to come forwards, to even acknowledge him, it was as if they were asleep, dormant inside the cores.  
但无论他们是谁，他们拒绝向前，甚至不愿承认他的存在，仿佛他们沉睡在核心之中，处于休眠状态。

As Unit-13 reached the spears, the Evangelion was rocked by two impacts, likely from the sniper that had accompanied Asuka. Was it that Mari girl from before?  
当 13 号机抵达长矛处时，这台福音战士被两次冲击撼动，很可能是跟随明日香的那名狙击手所为。会是之前那个叫真希波的女孩吗？

Shinji had no time to dwell on that as a new alien feeling washed over him. Unit-13 seemed to energize, Shinji watched in disbelief as two new arms detached from its chest from what he had thought to simply be more armor-plating.  
真嗣无暇深思，因为一种全新的异样感觉笼罩了他。13 号机似乎被激活了，真嗣难以置信地看着两条新手臂从他原以为只是更多装甲板的地方从其胸口分离出来。

Now the four arms latched onto the spears, Shinji scrambled, trying to do anything to prevent whatever was about to happen next. What was there to do though? He had never encountered anything like this before, nothing he did had any effect, Kaworu was useless, and without his mother in the core to fall back on he was helpless.  
现在四条手臂紧紧抓住长矛，真嗣慌乱地试图阻止即将发生的事情。然而，他又能做什么呢？他从未遇到过这样的情形，无论他做什么都毫无效果，渚薰帮不上忙，而且核心中没有母亲可以依靠，他感到无助。

"_I do not believe this is good," Rei mumbled behind him._  
"我觉得这不太妙，"丽在他身后喃喃道。

"_Gee you think Wondergirl?!"_  
"哎呀，你这么想啊，奇迹少女？!"

With a single tug, Unit-13 lifted the spears from Lilith's corpse, its four arms hoisting the red and black spears into the air triumphantly. For a fleeting moment nothing happened, it seemed all there to see just froze, too afraid to make a move. Finally, the corpse began to bubble, its skin stretching and expanding like a balloon, before it exploded in a shower of LCL.  
随着一次猛拉，13 号机从莉莉丝的尸体上拔出了长矛，四只手臂将红黑相间的长矛高高举起，胜利地挥舞着。有那么一瞬间，似乎一切都静止了，所有人都害怕得不敢动弹。最终，尸体开始冒泡，皮肤像气球一样拉伸膨胀，随后在一阵 LCL 的喷溅中爆炸开来。

Shinji braced himself for the impact with the ground, but it never came, instead the shower of red dissipated, clearing his view of a red pool beneath him while Unit-13 hovered mid-air. Beneath him, a dark blue and orange EVA hovered just above the pool, creating gentle ripples on the LCL below it.  
真嗣做好了与地面撞击的准备，但那撞击并未到来，取而代之的是一片红色消散，他的视线中出现了一片红色的池水，而 13 号机悬浮在半空中。在他下方，一架深蓝色与橙色相间的 EVA 悬浮在池水之上，轻轻地在水面上激起涟漪。

"Mark.06?" Shinji breathed, only to have his attention taken by the sound of an alarm going off, and a window appearing on his screen indicating a Type blue.  
“六号机？”真嗣喘息着，随即被一阵警报声吸引，屏幕上出现了一个窗口，显示着“蓝色类型”。

An angel, now? Besides the one next to him where…  
现在又是一个天使？除了他旁边的那一个……

"The 12th angel is showing signs of life!" Shinji heard Asuka shout through his coms.  
“第 12 使徒有生命迹象了！”真嗣通过通讯器听到了明日香的喊声。

So Mark.06 was the angel? Was it inside Mark.06? Shinji squinted, seeing its skin begin to bubble just as Lilith's corpse had, perhaps he was right.  
所以 Mark.06 就是使徒？它藏在 Mark.06 里面吗？真嗣眯起眼睛，看到它的皮肤开始像莉莉丝的尸体一样起泡，也许他猜对了。

Off to his left, he watched Unit-02, apparently recharged, running towards it. Asuka connected something that had been sent down from her partner above and attached it to the Unit-02s arm.  
在他左边，他看到 02 号机似乎已经充能完毕，正朝那边跑去。明日香连接了一个从上方搭档那里传下来的装置，并将其安装在 02 号机的手臂上。

From the opposite direction, he saw Mark.09 running up to it, scythe in hand. At first, Shinji was confused, why would his father have that clone attack it but not tell him that it was down here to begin with? Only after the clone, decapitated it did he understand.  
从对面方向，他看到 Mark.09 手持镰刀奔袭而来。起初，真嗣感到困惑，为何父亲会让那个克隆体攻击它，却不事先告知他它就在这里？直到克隆体将其斩首，他才恍然大悟。

Shinji's heart raced as the black tendril was released from the Evangelion, swirling around before seemingly focusing on Unit-13. Shinji again tried to gain control of the EVA, desperately trying to manifest an AT field, but nothing worked, soon he was encompassed by whatever it was.  
真嗣的心跳加速，当那黑色的触手从 EVA 中释放出来，旋转着围绕四周，似乎最终聚焦在 13 号机上。真嗣再次试图控制 EVA，拼命尝试生成 AT 力场，但一切都无济于事，很快他就被那未知的东西所包围。

"To think I could be so utterly ensnared." Kaworu said, finally speaking, "Me the first angel would fall to become thirteenth!"  
“没想到我竟会如此彻底地陷入其中。”渚薰终于开口说道，“我，第一位使徒，竟会堕落成为第十三位！”

"What the hell are you talking about Kaworu?!" He was the 17th angel, wasn't he?  
“你在说什么鬼话，渚薰？！他不是第 17 位使徒吗？”

"It means that the end and the beginning are one and the same," Kaworu said, dejected, "how fitting."  
“这意味着终结与起始实为一体，”渚薰神情沮丧地说，“真是恰如其分。”

"Kawour…" "卡哇尔…"

"_Shinji!"_  “真嗣！”

Shinji whipped around the uncharacteristic panic in Rei's voice drawing his attention.  
真嗣听到丽那不寻常的惊慌声音，立刻转身。

"_I do not want to go!" Rei's face was panicked, but Shinji wasn't sure what she was talking about. "I DO NOT WANT TO GO!" she shouted again, but before Shinji could say or do anything the translucent image of her flickered and vanished._  
"我不想去！" 丽的脸上满是恐慌，但真嗣不确定她在说什么。"我不想去！" 她再次大喊，但真嗣还没来得及说或做任何事，她那半透明的影像就闪烁着消失了。

"Rei?" he whispered, his heart racing in his chest, did that mean...  
“丽？”他低声呼唤，心跳如鼓，难道这意味着...

_His eyes raced to Soryu, who was looking at the spot Rei had been only moments ago. Her singular eye was wide, the disbelieve on her face clear. He waited, fear nearly overtaking him as he waited for her to disappear as well, but it never came.  
他的目光急切地转向索留，她正盯着丽刚才所在的地方。她那只独特的眼睛睁得大大的，脸上的难以置信清晰可见。他等待着，恐惧几乎要将他吞没，等待着她也会消失的那一刻，但那刻始终没有到来。_

Instead, the angel around them that had turned to the red core now converged, its form compressing to the size of a normal S2 engine in front of Unit-13. Shinji stared in disbelief as Unit-13's mouth unhinged and consumed the core in one bite.  
相反，环绕在他们周围的红色核心天使开始汇聚，其形态压缩至一个普通 S2 引擎的大小，悬浮在 13 号机前。真嗣难以置信地看着 13 号机的嘴部张开，一口吞下了那个核心。

The entire body shook, and Shinji watched the arms turn a blinding white. He didn't know what he expected next, but he certainly did not expect to fly straight up plowing through earth and concrete to finally be met with a clear sky.  
整个身体颤抖着，真嗣看着手臂变成了刺眼的白色。他不知道接下来会发生什么，但他绝对没想到自己会直冲云霄，穿过泥土和混凝土，最终迎来一片晴朗的天空。

There was no time to react however, the blue was overtaken by a deep red that originated from Unit-13. Never had  
然而，没有时间做出反应，蓝色被来自十三号机的深红色所吞没。从未有过

"What… is this?" “这……是什么？”

"The opening rights…" Kaworu said, bringing his head up from his hands, "The Fourth Impact."  
"开启权……" 渚薰从双手中抬起头，"第四次冲击。"

**Shoutouts 致谢**

**Fluffiddy – Perhaps it's only the beginning of the end.  
Fluffiddy – 或许这只是终结的开始。**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – Thanks!  
美利坚超旋 – 感谢！**

**alan2496 – Thank you! alan2496 – 谢谢！**

**skyf0x – You're on the right track about Kaworu's explanations, but in time you'll understand. Thanks for the great review!  
skyf0x – 你对渚薰的解释方向是正确的，但时间会帮助你理解。感谢你的精彩评论！**

**Guest (1) – Well how about we ask a new question? Is he dead in this story?  
Guest (1) – 那我们换个问题如何？在这个故事里，他死了吗？**

**Attila1987 – I think Shinji is still somewhat blinded by the chance of redemption, enough that he's going against his better wisdom and trusting Kaworu, though it happens that even Kaworu doesn't have all the answers this time. He's also got to account for his father, who hasn't exactly sat idle for the last 10 years. He can throw curveballs just as good as Shinji can now and I'd love to keep up with the 'not-so-stranger in a strange land' vibe with Shinji, where he knows how things are 'supposed' to work based on NGE, but things have moved on and the rules have changed. It's a bit grey whether there was some sort of control going on right before he was grabbing the spears in 3.0, but here he legitimately is not in control, just like in 3.0 after the 4****th** **impact starts, he's needed cause it ends when he's ejected.**  
Attila1987 – 我认为真嗣仍被救赎的可能性所蒙蔽，以至于他违背了自己的明智判断，选择信任渚薰，尽管这次连渚薰也没有所有答案。他还得考虑他的父亲，这十年来他并未闲着。他现在能像真嗣一样投出曲线球，我很想继续保持真嗣那种‘并非完全陌生之地’的感觉，他知道事情‘应该’如何运作，基于《新世纪福音战士》（NGE），但事物已经发展，规则也改变了。在 3.0 中，他在抓住长矛之前是否有所控制有些模糊，但在这里，他确实失去了控制，就像 3.0 中第四次冲击开始后，他被弹出时一样，他是必要的，因为冲击在他被弹出时结束。

**Guest (2) – High hopes are for newbies, Shinji's long past that phase.  
Guest (2) – 新人总怀揣着高期望，但真嗣早已过了那个阶段。**

**Fraktal – Well… Mari's out of the picture and Asuka's got a bit more on her mind this time. What would you feel if you saw it through her view? She's been told Shinji's a traitor for years now, but he saves her in Operation US. He appears to be crazy and talking to air, but he's capable of talking to her and even remembering moments together. He tells her to find him and she's expecting Shinji to essentially be waiting for her, she's put her belief in him whether she'll admit it or not, so when she shows up and he's piloting, it's a betrayal because she can't keep going off of faith anymore then he can't really say what he's doing, but in the end, it doesn't matter. I'd say Gendo is once bitten twice shy of his son lol.  
Fraktal – 嗯……玛丽已经不在了，而这次明日香心中多了些牵挂。如果你从她的视角来看会怎样？多年来她一直被灌输真嗣是叛徒的观念，但在 US 作战中他救了她。他看似疯狂，对着空气说话，却能与她交流，甚至记得共同经历的瞬间。他告诉她去找他，她期待着真嗣基本上是在等她，无论她是否承认，她已经把信任寄托在他身上，所以当她出现而他却在驾驶时，这感觉像是一种背叛，因为她不能再仅凭信念前行，而他也不能真正解释自己在做什么，但最终，这都不重要。我觉得源堂是‘一朝被蛇咬，十年怕井绳’，对儿子的态度真是如此，哈哈。**

**engel17white – Thanks, it'll be interesting when it happens.  
engel17white – 谢谢，到时一定会很有趣的。**

**tomdj1701 – Thanks! tomdj1701 – 谢谢！**

**Well, that took a while…  
哎，这可花了不少时间……**

**This semester has really sucked, I've been doing so much writing that whenever I would just hate looking at Word whenever I opened it up to write. The good news, however, is that the semester is almost over and I really want Chapter 60 to be done so expect it by the end of December, I'm serious this time. After that everything is dependent, the holidays should give me a good head start.  
这个学期真是糟糕透顶，我写了太多东西，以至于每次打开 Word 准备写作时都感到厌恶。不过好消息是，学期即将结束，我真的很想完成Chapter 60，预计年底前能搞定，这次我是认真的。之后的一切都看情况了，假期应该能让我有个好的开始。**

**Until Next Time 下次再见**

### Chapter 60: "…Won't you come with me to the end of the world…"  
Chapter 60: "…你愿意随我走到世界尽头吗…"

_As Unit-02 and its target began to hit the upper reaches of the atmosphere Asuka was pushed back into her seat, the massive forces from her rapid deceleration working on her body, but she barely noticed.  
当二号机及其目标开始冲击大气层上层时，明日香被猛地推回座位，高速减速带来的巨大力量作用在她身上，但她几乎未曾察觉。_

_The pendant floated into her vision, its worn and repaired string stretched out back to her neck, reminding her of the microgravity environment she was still in. The Second Child just stared at the cross floating in the last moments before they hit the atmosphere, reminding her of the boy she could never seem to forget.  
吊坠飘入她的视线，磨损修补过的细绳向后延伸至她的颈部，提醒她仍处于微重力环境中。第二适格者只是凝视着那枚在即将进入大气层前的最后时刻悬浮的十字架，让她想起了那个始终难以忘怀的男孩。_

After all this time… 经过了这么久……

He had saved her. 他救了她。

One last gift from Shinji Ikari.  
来自碇真嗣的最后一份礼物。

_As she finally began to hit the outer layer of the atmosphere, she braced herself as best she could inside the entry plug. It wasn't like they had harnesses built into the seats, so she locked the controls and held on tight as brilliant trails of plasma licked at the sides of her sporadic view from inside the entry plug.  
当她终于开始触及大气层的外层时，她在插入栓内尽可能地做好准备。座位上并没有安全带，所以她锁定了控制器，紧紧抓住，从插入栓内不时闪现的视野中，可以看到明亮的等离子尾迹舔舐着两侧。_

_Finally, she braced herself as best she could inside the entry plug. It wasn't like they had harnesses built into the seats, so she locked the controls and held on tight as brilliant trails of plasma licked at the sides of her sporadic view from inside the entry plug.  
终于，她在驾驶舱内尽可能地做好了准备。毕竟座位上没有安全带，所以她锁定了控制器，紧紧抓住，从驾驶舱内不时闪过的视野中，可以看到耀眼的等离子轨迹舔舐着两侧。_

_When the chute deployed and she finally let go of the controls her whole body collapsed in the seat, every movement was a labor, even her breathing seemed to be a struggle. Somehow years' worth of emotions had come and gone.  
当降落伞展开，她终于松开控制器时，整个身体瘫坐在座椅上，每一个动作都显得费力，甚至连呼吸都似乎成了一种挣扎。不知怎么的，多年的情感就这样来去匆匆。_

"_Welcome back… Unit-01." She whispered, "Thank you… Shinji."_  
“欢迎回来……初号机。”她低声说道，“谢谢你……真嗣。”

_She closed her eyes, letting the ocean waves rock her steadily, imagining familiar arms around her. When her Eva was finally retrieved and the rocking stopped, so did the fantasy, and for once she wasn't sad to let it go.  
她闭上眼睛，任由海浪稳稳地摇晃着她，想象着熟悉的臂膀环绕在身旁。当她的伊娃终于被找回，摇晃停止时，幻想也随之消散，这一次她并不感到悲伤，而是欣然放手。_

_Maybe this is what it felt like.  
也许这就是那种感觉。_

Closure. 释怀。

ʡʘʘʘʢ

"Asuka." “明日香。”

She just kept looking down at the SDAT player in her hand, her grip tightening on it.  
她只是不停地低头看着手中的 SDAT 播放器，握力逐渐收紧。

"ASUKA!" “明日香！”

A groan escaped her as Asuka brought her hand up to her head.  
明日香将手举到头上时，她发出了一声呻吟。

"Wha…" “什…”

"That's better, thought I lost you there."  
“这样好多了，我还以为你不见了呢。”

Her eye opened to what should have been a clear blue sky, instead, it met a deep crimson. At first, she was confused, however, the fog quickly cleared and she recalled what had just happened. Forcing the Unit-02 to its feet, Asuka looked around them, the earth itself seemed to crumble and be left to orbit around the epicenter of the Fourth Impact.  
她的眼睛本应看到一片清澈的蓝天，却映入了一片深红。起初，她感到困惑，但迷雾很快散去，她记起了刚刚发生的事。阿斯卡强迫二号机站起身，环顾四周，大地仿佛在崩裂，围绕着第四次冲击的中心旋转。

Before either could say anything a bright flash illuminated the world around them, and they watched as Wunder began to plummet from the sky.  
在他们能说出任何话之前，一道强光点亮了周围的世界，他们眼睁睁看着 Wunder 开始从天空中坠落。

"Ok, this is totally getting out of hand," Mari commented, tossing away her rifle.  
“好吧，这完全失控了。”玛丽评论道，扔掉了她的步枪。

"You help Wunder, I'll go take care of..."  
“你帮旺达，我去处理……”

"No." Mari cut her off. She spoke with a tone Asuka couldn't recall ever hearing before, it was firm, forceful even, lacking the typical charm that was slathered on.  
“不行。”玛丽打断了她。她的语气是阿斯卡从未听过的，坚定有力，甚至缺乏了平时那种涂抹上的魅力。

"That's an order," Asuka said, before starting to walk away.  
“这是命令。”明日香说完，便开始走开。

"I saw Asuka, hell I heard you!" Mari shouted, "I'll take care of Shinji!"  
“我看到明日香了，我听见了！”玛丽喊道，“我会照顾好真嗣的！”

"Are we seriously having his argument right now?" Asuka barked, to which Mari just nodded.  
"我们现在真的要吵这个吗？" 明日香咆哮道，对此玛丽只是点了点头。

Another explosion rocked Wunder, causing Asuka to look back at the ship. She wanted to tell her to shove off, but every second they stood there arguing would only make the situation worse. They just didn't have time for this.  
又一次爆炸震撼了 Wunder 号，使得明日香回头望向飞船。她本想叫她滚开，但每多一秒他们站在这里争吵，情况只会变得更糟。他们根本没有时间浪费在这上面。

"Fine." She said, dashing towards the crippled ship, cursing Four-Eyes with every step, but deep down, she knew the girl was right.  
"好吧。" 她说着，冲向那艘残破的飞船，每走一步都在咒骂着四眼，但内心深处，她知道那女孩是对的。

ʡʘʘʘʢ

Shinji could only stare in amazement at the calamity unfolding in front of him. The shattered ruins of Tokyo-03 crumbled away as the earth split open. Remnants of buildings, torsos, and earth began to circle them, while the ground gave way to something massive rising to the surface.  
真嗣只能目瞪口呆地看着眼前这场灾难的展开。东京-03 的破碎废墟随着大地裂开而崩塌。建筑残骸、人形躯干和泥土开始围绕他们旋转，而地面则让位于某个巨大的物体正从地表升起。

Its black exterior made Shinji shutter, he had never seen it so incomplete before, but there was no mistaking it. It was a Black Moon.  
它那漆黑的外观让真嗣不禁打了个寒颤，他从未见过它如此不完整，但毫无疑问，这是一轮黑月。

Nothing made sense anymore, with each passing moment he felt more and more hopelessly lost as things no longer made sense to him. All he had left was the one beside him, and he would have given anything to have someone else  
一切都变得毫无意义，随着时间的推移，他感到越来越绝望地迷失，因为事情对他来说已经不再有意义。他唯一剩下的就是身边的人，他愿意付出一切来换取另一个人的陪伴。

Turning to Kaworu, his eyes widened at the sight of the DSS choker activating, a series of blood-red prisms circling his neck, "Fix th…" Shinji's words were cut short by the impact of something big against Unit-13.  
转向薰，他的眼睛因看到 DSS 项圈激活而睁大，一串血红色的棱镜环绕着他的脖子，“修复……”真嗣的话被某样巨大物体撞击 13 号机打断了。

Twisting in his seat, Wunder engulfed his entire vision. How could he have forgotten? If Asuka was here then Misato had to be as well. To be fair, it wasn't like something as if Wunder was normal to him.  
扭身坐在座位上，Wunder 完全占据了视野。他怎么可能忘记？如果明日香在这里，那么美里也一定在。说起来，Wunder 对他来说并不寻常，这也不是什么奇怪的事。

_Soryu rolled her eyes, and Shinji swore he could hear smart remarks, but he refused to let them get to him.  
惣流翻了个白眼，真嗣发誓他听到了那些尖酸刻薄的话，但他坚决不让它们影响自己。_

Shinji franticly reached for the controls, he had talked to Asuka, and he should be able to communicate with Wunder. Unfortunately, it appeared Misato wasn't going to make it easy for him, he could feel an AT field starting to crush down on Unit-13, and suddenly he was pouring everything he had into strengthening his own AT field to no avail.  
真嗣慌忙伸手去抓控制器，他曾与明日香交谈过，理应能与 Wunder 沟通。不幸的是，看来美里不会让他轻易得逞，他能感觉到 AT 力场开始压迫 Unit-13，而他突然倾尽全力加强自己的 AT 力场却毫无效果。

Salvo after salvo was shot point blank from Wunder's guns, but much to Shinji's surprise it all suddenly stopped an explosion on Wunder's front lit up the entire screen and the ship began to plummet to the ground. From a distance, he could see what was left of Mark.09 pursuing the ship, and the feeling of helplessness just grew inside him.  
Wunder 的炮火一连串近距离射击，但令真嗣惊讶的是，这一切突然停止了，Wunder 前部发生爆炸，整个屏幕都被照亮，飞船开始坠向地面。从远处，他能看到 Mark.09 的残骸正追逐着飞船，那种无助感在他心中愈发强烈。

Effortlessly, Unit-13 glided back to its original place, the epicenter above the black moon.  
毫不费力地，13 号机滑回了原位，位于黑月之上的震中。

"How is this even possible?" Shinji asked out loud, he was out of ideas, out of solutions. For all his knowledge, all his experience, it had all failed him when it mattered most. All he had now was the angel across from him, someone he'd rather replace with almost anyone.  
“这怎么可能？”真嗣大声问道，他已无计可施，无解可寻。尽管他学识渊博，经验丰富，但在最关键的时刻，这一切都辜负了他。现在他唯一拥有的，是对面的天使，一个他宁愿换成几乎任何人的存在。

"This isn't your fault Shinji, I'm the trigger, not you." Kaworu said slowly, "A piece of Lilith has merged with Unit-13 and I've become the 13th Angel."  
“这不是你的错，真嗣，我是触发者，不是你。”渚薰缓缓说道，“莉莉丝的一部分已经与 13 号机融合，我成为了第 13 使徒。”

Shinji took a deep breath of LCL and gripped the controls tighter, he just had to stay calm, "So how do we stop it? There has to be something." Couldn't he just say something? How hard was it to tell the truth? Despite everything that was happening, despite how completely sideways everything turned out, he couldn't just tell him the truth.  
真嗣深吸了一口 LCL，握紧操纵杆，他必须保持冷静，“那我们怎么阻止它？一定有什么办法。”他难道就不能说点什么吗？说出真相有多难？尽管发生了这一切，尽管事情完全偏离了轨道，他就是不能告诉他真相。

"Even after a soul is gone, its wishes and curses still cling to this world and the people around them." Kaworu said softly, "in time, we rewrite the very nature of who we are."  
“即使灵魂消逝，其愿望与诅咒仍会缠绕于世人与周遭。”渚薰轻声说道，“随着时间流逝，我们重塑了自身的本质。”

"Enough with the bullshit!" Shinji yelled, getting out of his seat and throwing a punch, his hand hitting the invisible barrier between them, "Just tell me what I have to do!"  
“别再扯淡了！”真嗣吼道，起身挥拳，拳头撞上了他们之间的无形屏障，“告诉我该怎么做！”

Kaworu frowned, "I'm sorry Shinji, this is not the happiness you deserved, I'll close the gates of Guf." he said, looking up at the sky above them, into the pitch-black void beyond, "You'll have to find Cassius on your own, only then can you find peace and return to the place you belong."  
渚薰皱起眉头，“对不起，真嗣，这不是你应得的幸福，我会关闭生命之果的大门。”他抬头望向他们头顶的天空，凝视着那片漆黑的虚空，“你必须独自找到卡修斯，只有这样，你才能找到安宁，回到你该去的地方。”

Shinji felt Unit-13 begin to move and a feeling of elation shot through him. He could feel the right arm beginning to come to life, but soon realized what it was positioning itself to do. His head snapped to his copilot but anything he would have said was swiftly torn from his mind as the first spear rushed for their Evangelion's torso.  
真嗣感觉到 13 号机开始移动，一股喜悦之情涌上心头。他能感觉到右臂开始苏醒，但很快意识到它准备做什么。他的头猛地转向副驾驶，但任何他可能说出的话都被第一支长矛冲向他们的 EVA 胸部的瞬间夺走了。

The pain of the first spear exploded in his chest, somehow the burning sensation was worse than he remembered and his body lurched, his back arching in pain despite his efforts. Shinji glared at him from the corner of his eye, he could control it, he let this happen, just like last time. This would be his reward for trusting him again.  
第一支长矛刺入胸膛的剧痛在他胸中炸裂，那灼烧感不知怎的比记忆中更为剧烈，他的身体猛地一颤，尽管极力忍耐，背部仍因疼痛而弓起。眼角余光中，真嗣瞪视着他，他能控制这一切，是他放任此事发生，一如上次。这便是他再次信任他的代价。

"Keep going Shinji, I know you'll reach the end of your journey soon enough," Kaworu said, as the pain of a second spear shot through his chest. Shinji did he best to catch his breath while glaring at his co-pilot.  
"继续前进，真嗣，我知道你很快就能到达旅程的终点，" 渚薰说道，同时第二支长矛穿透他的胸膛带来的痛苦袭来。真嗣尽力喘息，同时怒视着他的副驾驶。

"Remember, once you return, your soul will invert, and you'll no longer be Lilin, if you fail… a fate worse than this existence awaits you. Let the ties that bind be your guide." Kaworu said before he turned around, and looked straight at Soryu. The girl's surprise was evident, someone other than Shinji had just acknowledged her existence and she glanced over to Shinji as if to get some confirmation this was indeed happening.  
"记住，一旦你回来，你的灵魂将会反转，你将不再是人类，如果你失败了……等待你的命运比现在的生活更糟糕。让那些束缚你的纽带成为你的指引。" 渚薰说完后转过身，直视着绫波。女孩的惊讶显而易见，除了真嗣之外，终于有人承认了她的存在，她瞥向真嗣，似乎在寻求确认这一切是否真的发生。

"Take care of him," he said flashing her a thin smile, "He'll need you before the end."  
"照顾好他，" 他微微一笑，"在终点之前，他会需要你的。"

Shinji's look of surprise was ignored by Kaworu, who acted as if nothing had just happened, "Now, look away Shinji, you don't need to see this."  
真嗣的惊讶表情被渚薰无视了，他表现得就像什么都没发生过一样，“现在，转过头去吧，真嗣，你不需要看到这些。”

He shouldn't have felt sorry for him, time after time he had been his executioner, yet here it felt different. When he wasn't in control it all felt so… wrong, and at that moment, he couldn't shake the feeling that he wouldn't see him again.  
他本不该为他感到难过，一次又一次，他都是他的刽子手，但这次感觉不同。当他无法掌控一切时，一切都显得那么……不对劲，那一刻，他无法摆脱一种感觉，那就是他不会再见到他了。

Despite the burning in his chest, Shinji flashed a fake smile, one last act of defiance against the one who he had hated for so long, "What's one more nightmare?"  
尽管胸口灼痛难忍，真嗣还是挤出了一个假笑，这是他对那个长久以来憎恨之人最后的反抗，“再多一个噩梦又何妨？”

Kaworu's face betrayed his emotions and his smile suddenly turned to one of genuine happiness.  
渚薰的脸上流露出他的情感，他的微笑突然转变为真挚的喜悦。

"You really have changed." He said, before the collar detonated, painting the entry plug red.  
“你真的变了。”他说道，随后项圈引爆，将插入栓染成一片血红。

ʡʘʘʘʢ

She had to give herself credit, ramming that Evangelion with Wunder had to be one of the dumbest plans she'd ever thought of. Despite realizing this, she knew there was little else she would have been able to do.  
她不得不承认，用 Wunder 号撞击那台 EVA，绝对是她想过的最愚蠢的计划之一。尽管意识到了这一点，她知道除此之外，她别无选择。

As soon as she saw the massive tear in the fabric of reality form, Misato ordered the ship at flank speed toward the epicenter. Memories of 10 years ago began to play in her head, the red sky and the world around them being torn apart had made her grip the railing on the bridge tighter than before.  
一见到那巨大的现实裂缝形成，美里便命令战舰全速驶向震中。十年前的记忆开始在脑海中回放，那片红空和周围世界被撕裂的景象，让她比以往更紧地抓住了舰桥上的栏杆。

The ascending Evangelion was not the same as Unit-01, its body was pure white and it held two spears in its four arms. More worryingly, if Mari's message back to the ship was to be believed, then Shinji was piloting it.  
升起的 EVA 并非初号机，其身躯纯白，四臂各持两柄长矛。更令人担忧的是，如果真希波传回的信息属实，那么驾驶它的正是真嗣。

Her attention was drawn to the spears, which she knew should've been red, but one was black confounding her even as she ordered the bridge crew to seal the Eva inside Wunder's AT field. If it had to use the spears to break free that might buy them some time.  
她的目光被那两柄长矛吸引，她记得本应是红色的，但其中一柄却是黑色，这让她困惑不已，即便如此，她仍命令舰桥人员在 Wunder 的 AT 力场内封锁 EVA。如果它必须用长矛破封而出，或许能争取些许时间。

"All main guns ready salvo! Load high-angle rounds!" Misato shouted.  
"所有主炮准备齐射！装填高角弹！" 美里喊道。

Soon the bridge lit up with the flash of the guns, each round impacting an AT field further away only to ricochet off back to hit the ascending Eva.  
很快，舰桥被炮火闪光照亮，每一发炮弹击中更远的 AT 力场后，又反弹回来击中正在上升的 EVA。

"I want a sitrep, what damage are we doing?" Misato barked.  
"我要战况报告，我们造成了什么损害？" 美里厉声问道。

"Impacts had no effect on target!" Ritsuko said.  
“攻击对目标无效！”律子说道。

"Give it another salvo!" “再发射一波！”

Again and again, they pounded the Evangelion with Wunder's guns, but each time they had no effect. This was what Wunder was meant to do, to equalize the playing field, but now she could only order more salvos, praying they would defeat the AT field.  
他们一次又一次地用 Wunder 的炮火轰击着那台 Evangelion，但每一次都毫无效果。这正是 Wunder 被设计来完成的任务，平衡战局，但现在她只能命令继续发射，祈祷能击破 AT 力场。

Everything fell apart the moment the Vessel of the Adams took them by surprise. In just one blast their main guns were knocked out, and they had little time to react as it only took another for Wunder to start falling from the sky.  
一切在亚当容器突然袭击的那一刻分崩离析。仅一击，他们的主炮就被摧毁，几乎没有时间反应，因为紧接着，奇迹号就开始从天空中坠落。

"It means to take the ship back!" Ritsuko shouted as another blast rocked the ship, "It's the original master of Wunder!"  
“这意味着要夺回这艘船！”律子在又一次爆炸中喊道，“这是奇迹号的原主人！”

"I want any remaining guns trained on that Evangelion! Get it off the ship!" Misato ordered. If they could break away from it, get some distance maybe then they'd have a chance  
“我要所有剩余的炮火瞄准那台福音战士！把它从船上赶走！”美里命令道。如果能摆脱它，拉开距离，或许他们还有一线生机。

"Unidentified data infiltrating the main control system!" "It's taking over control of the entire ship!"  
"不明数据侵入主控系统！" "它正在接管整艘船的控制权！"

"Reports from observation deck, it's Unit-02, she's engaging the hostile Unit!"  
"来自观察甲板的报告，是二号机，她正在与敌方单位交战！"

If their systems had locked them out, then it meant Unit-02 was their only hope of surviving this now. Misato frowned, but she knew if she was going to trust anyone to get them out of this then it ought to be Asuka.  
如果他们的系统已经将他们拒之门外，那么现在二号机是他们唯一的生存希望。美里皱了皱眉，但她知道，如果要信任谁能带他们脱离险境，那非明日香莫属。

"I'm counting on you Asuka."  
"明日香，全靠你了。"

Nothing had happened. 什么都没发生。

Unit-13 was still activated, and the gates were still open. Was that another lie, or was Kaworu's knowledge just like his, flawed? The sincerity of his final words still rang with Shinji, but he would have to dwell on them later.  
13 号机依然处于激活状态，大门依旧敞开着。这是又一个谎言，还是说渚薰的知识和他一样，都有缺陷？他最后那番真诚的话语仍在真嗣耳边回响，但他只能稍后再去深思。

"_What a mess," Soryu said, frowning at the body in front of her._  
“真是乱七八糟，”惣流皱着眉头看着眼前的尸体说道。

Shinji gripped the controls, running through switches and buttons, pulling on the control columns, but there was nothing. He could feel the panic creeping in now, what was he supposed to do? What could he do?  
真嗣紧握操纵杆，逐一检查开关和按钮，拉动控制杆，但一切都是徒劳。他感到恐慌正悄然袭来，他该怎么办？他能做什么？

He shook his head, panic wasn't the answer, he would find a way. Again he went over his controls, thinking back to any trick or combination of commands he could think of only to fail to achieve anything again.  
他摇了摇头，恐慌不是解决之道，他一定能找到办法。于是他再次审视自己的控制装置，回想着任何可能的技巧或命令组合，却再次一无所获。

He peered out at the world around him, hoping an answer would come to him, all he was gifted was a massive explosion down near the surface. Squinting, he saw what he assumed was Wunder, the massive winged ship that flew dangerously close to the ground and the source of the explosion, the two figures fighting on top of it.  
他凝视着四周的世界，期待答案会降临，却只得到了地表附近的一场巨大爆炸。眯起眼睛，他看到了那艘庞大的飞翼船——Wunder，它危险地贴近地面飞行，正是爆炸的源头，而船顶上正有两道身影在激战。

"Asuka!" Shinji could see her fighting something down on the ship, only now seeing the size of the thing.  
“明日香！” 真嗣能看到她在船上与某个东西搏斗，直到现在才看清那东西的巨大身躯。

"C'mon! Isn't anyone in here!" he shouted, working the controls.  
“快点！这里没人吗！” 他喊道，操作着控制台。

Within the EVA he felt something stir. It reached out lethargically, like someone waking from a deep sleep. It certainly wasn't anything like his mother, it felt wrong, even with the greater sense he was getting from them now, he still couldn't identify them.  
在 EVA 内部，他感觉到有什么东西在动。它懒洋洋地伸展开来，就像刚从沉睡中醒来的人。这绝不像他的母亲，感觉不对劲，即便现在他从中获得了更强烈的感知，他仍然无法辨认出它们。

Whoever it was seemed interested, so he did his best to coax them out of their dormancy. Despite the stress and pain, he did his best to remain calm, to seek help, and certainly keep from scaring them away. He ignored the desire to know who it was, instead focusing only on relaying his goal.  
无论对方是谁，似乎都表现出了兴趣，于是他竭尽全力将他们从沉睡中唤醒。尽管承受着压力和痛苦，他仍尽力保持冷静，寻求帮助，并确保不把他们吓跑。他压抑住想要知道对方是谁的欲望，只专注于传达自己的目标。

Whatever was in the core all of a sudden sprung to life in a single spectacular moment. The truth was Shinji didn't know how much of it was him and how much of it was whoever was in the core. It didn't matter, like a flash of lightning, Unit-13 ripped the black spear from its chest in one fluid movement and pulled it back, aiming down at Wunder, before it hurled it downwards.  
核心中的存在突然间以一个惊人的瞬间苏醒过来。事实上，真嗣并不清楚这其中有多少是他自己的意志，又有多少是核心中那个存在的意志。但这并不重要，就像一道闪电划过，13 号机以流畅的动作从胸口撕裂出那根黑色长矛，将其拉回，瞄准了 Wunder，然后猛地向下投掷。

The shockwave rippled through the air as the projectile was launched at supersonic speeds towards its target. Shinji watched as the spear rushed to its target like a smite from the heavens. On his screen, he saw Unit-02 fighting with whatever Mark.09 had transformed into, and shooting toward them was the spear. He watched as the two combatants disengaged, Unit-02 jumping back from her counterpart just as the spear impacted perfectly.  
冲击波在空气中荡漾开来，当那枚弹丸以超音速射向目标时。真嗣目睹着长矛如天罚般疾驰向目标。在他的屏幕上，他看到 02 号机正与变形成不知何种形态的 Mark.09 激战，而那支长矛正朝它们飞射而去。他注视着两位战士分开，02 号机从对手身边跃开，就在长矛完美击中目标的那一刻。

The explosion of Mark.09 blinded his view, though now that was the least of his worries. Although Unit-13 had been floating, Shinji felt a pit in his stomach. It only grew, and he recognized the feeling of freefall. The entry plug began to shake as he picked up speed, while the assortment of orbit earth rushed past him. Unit-13s skin remained a bright white, and the gates above him still refused to close.  
Mark.09 的爆炸让他的视野一片空白，尽管现在这已是他最不担心的事。尽管 13 号机一直悬浮着，真嗣感到胃里一阵翻腾。这种感觉愈发强烈，他意识到自己在自由落体。插入栓开始摇晃，随着他加速下坠，地球轨道上的景象匆匆掠过。13 号机的外壳依旧白得耀眼，而上方的大门依旧紧闭。

He called on whoever was in the core to help him, to do something, but that single burst of life had now evaporated and he was left to fall to the earth. The Eva itself would be fine on impact, but he on the other hand likely wouldn't survive the forces of impact.  
他呼唤着核心中的任何人来帮助他，做些什么，但那一瞬间的生命迹象现已消散，他只能任由自己坠向地球。EVA 本身在撞击下会安然无恙，但他自己却很可能无法承受撞击的冲击力。

Out of the corner of his eye, Shinji spotted the movements of something among the red. Surprisingly, it was pink, fast-moving, and was heading right for him. Based on what he was seeing, whoever was piloting had skill, each jump from floating debris was precise, calculated, and efficient, the pilot was beyond comfortable in their machine.  
眼角余光中，真嗣瞥见一抹红色中有什么在移动。出乎意料的是，那东西是粉色的，移动迅速，正直冲他而来。从他所见来看，驾驶者技艺高超，每一次从漂浮的残骸中跃出都精准、计算得当且高效，这位驾驶员对其机体驾轻就熟。

He had made that assessment as the Evangelion reached Unit-13's trajectory, and he watched as it jumped into the open air right as he passed them. His commlink connected to the pilot and once they appeared on his screen, Shinji found himself recognizing the girl.  
他做出这一判断时，那台福音战士已进入 13 号机的轨迹，他看着它在他经过时跃入开阔的空中。通讯链接接通了驾驶员，当她出现在屏幕上时，真嗣发现自己认出了那个女孩。

"Wait! You're…" "等等！你是……"

"Enough with the reunions!" the girl shouted. Shinji felt the impact of her Eva as she wrestled with Unit-13 mid-air, "You need to eject, you're still the trigger!"  
“够了，别再叙旧了！”女孩大喊道。真嗣感受到她的 Eva 在空中与 13 号机搏斗的冲击，“你得弹射出去，你依然是那个触发器！”

"I've been trying!" Shinji shouted, desperately yanking the ejection handle again, "Can you eject the plug from outside? The latch is under the shoulder!"  
“我一直在试！”真嗣嘶吼着，再次拼命拉动弹射把手，“你能从外面弹射插头吗？闩锁在肩膀下面！”

After a moment of grappling, she made her way onto Unit-13's back. Shinji heard the sound of tearing metal as the girl peeled back armor platting searching for what he knew should be there.  
经过片刻的缠斗，她爬上了 13 号机的背部。真嗣听到金属撕裂的声音，女孩正剥开装甲板，寻找他知道应该在那里的东西。

"I can't find one!" She said, the panic clear in her voice, "What else can you do in there?!"  
"我找不到一个！" 她喊道，声音中的恐慌显而易见，"你还能在那里做什么？！"

"Nothing!" Shinji shouted, pulling the ejection handle out over and over again, "I have no control!"  
"什么都没有！" 真嗣大喊，一遍又一遍地拉出弹射把手，"我无法控制！"

"_Idiot Shinji." he heard Soryu mumble," It's right here!" He looked over at the other entry plug. It was hard to make out through the blood that caked the walls, but he swore he was seeing the translucent figure Soryu in the pilot's seat._  
"笨蛋真嗣。" 他听到丽嘀咕，"就在这儿！" 他转头看向另一个插入栓。尽管墙壁上覆盖着血迹，难以辨认，但他发誓他看到了坐在驾驶座上的丽那透明的身影。

A split second later the screen went black, and he was forced back into his seat, crushed by the forces of the ejection, then the weightlessness of freefall followed. Once he was certain the parachute deployed Shinji felt every muscle in his body slowly relax, the adrenaline finally wearing off and leaving exhaustion in its wake.  
一瞬间后，屏幕变黑，他被猛地推回座位，承受着弹射的巨大力量，随后是自由落体的失重感。确认降落伞打开后，真嗣感到全身肌肉慢慢放松，肾上腺素终于消退，留下疲惫不堪。

While he sat in darkness, waiting for the final lurch of the plug touching down, he was left with more questions than answers and building frustration. Left with only his thoughts, the frustration turned to anger as he thought of how he had gotten to this point, of every mistake he made trusting someone he should have never trusted, and the bitterness left after ignoring warnings from those he always did.  
他在黑暗中坐着，等待着插入栓着陆的最后一震，心中疑问多于答案，挫败感逐渐累积。只剩下自己的思绪，挫败转为愤怒，他回想起自己如何走到这一步，每一次信任不该信任的人所犯的错误，以及忽视那些他一直信任的人的警告后的苦涩。

Of course, by the time the entry plug shook from touchdown and the LCL began to drain, he knew there was only one person to blame. The same person who was responsible for all of this, they were the one staring back at him from the reflective wall of the entry plug.  
当然，当插入栓因着陆而震动，LCL 开始排出时，他知道只有一个该怪罪的人。同一个人要对这一切负责，他们就是从插入栓的反射壁上回望着他的那个人。

'No pattern blue readings detected. Monitored airspace remains clear.'  
'未检测到蓝色读数模式。监控空域保持清空状态。'

'Emergency repairs to midship areas complete.'  
'中段区域的紧急维修已完成。'

'Unit-02 and Unit-08 recovered with minimal damage.'  
'零二号机与零八号机在轻微损伤下恢复。'

Just like that everything had gone silent. The Fourth Impact averted, and with no thanks to any of their efforts. Misato didn't have any words, not for the crew on the helm, not for Ritsuko, not for anyone.  
就这样，一切突然静止了。第四次冲击被阻止，但这并非他们的功劳。美里无言以对，无论是对驾驶舱的船员，还是对律子，或是任何人。

Her first officer was talking to her, offering some words about how this should be a win for them, but she wasn't listening, she was trying to understand everything that had just happened. They had nearly lost Wunder, nearly lost their Evas, it had been a complete disaster that they were lucky to get out of alive.  
她的副官正对她说话，试图表达这次他们应该算是胜利了，但她没在听，她正努力理解刚刚发生的一切。他们差点失去了 Wunder 号，差点失去了他们的 EVA，这简直是一场灾难，他们能活着逃出来已是万幸。

Both Evangelions had been recovered, but they couldn't lock onto Asuka's beacon, and they couldn't stay in the area to look for her any longer, not with such a crippled ship. As they gained distance between themselves and the remnants of Tokyo-03, she silently prayed.  
两台 EVA 都已回收，但他们无法锁定明日香的信号，而且他们不能在这个区域停留太久，毕竟船只受损严重。当他们与东京-03 的废墟拉开距离时，她默默祈祷。

She didn't know if she could lose another pilot.  
她不知道自己是否还能承受失去另一位驾驶员的痛苦。

ʡʘʘʘʢ

As she marched across the wasteland the thought of how Wunder would find her in such a strong L barrier was not on her mind, nor was the fact she had been seconds away from using Unit-02s self-destruct to kill the Angel. She wasn't thinking about the pain in her leg as she navigated the ruins of Tokyo-03, or the chirping Geiger counter in her pack. All she could think about was getting to that ejected entry plug.  
当她穿越荒原时，心中并未考虑 Wunder 如何在如此强大的 L 屏障中找到她，也没有意识到自己曾几秒之差就要使用二号机的自爆来消灭使徒。她没有在意腿上的疼痛，也没有理会背包中不断鸣叫的盖革计数器。她满脑子只有一个念头：找到那个弹射出的插入栓。

With each step she broke the silence that surrounded her. She had gotten over the shock of how quiet it could get, but this was different. The calm after this aborted cataclysm was somehow pleasing in its own way.  
每走一步，她都打破了周围的寂静。她已经从最初的震惊中恢复过来，知道这里可以有多么安静，但这次不同。这场未遂灾难后的宁静，以某种方式自有一种令人愉悦之处。

She couldn't enjoy the feeling though.  
然而，她无法享受这种感觉。

She was going to kill him. It was that simple.  
她要杀了他。就这么简单。

As she gripped her leg with one hand and hobbled towards the ejected entry plug her other hand began to shake, though she wasn't certain if it was from anger or just nerves. She had the clarity of mind to leave the SDAT player in her emergency bag, sparing it from a lethal death grip.  
她用一只手紧握着腿，一瘸一拐地走向弹出的驾驶舱，另一只手开始颤抖，尽管她不确定这是出于愤怒还是仅仅是紧张。她头脑清醒，将 SDAT 播放器留在了应急包里，免得它被捏坏。

Even from a distance, she could clearly see it had already been opened, its hatch was laying in the sand, while behind it the plug's enormous parachute was strewn over the remains of buildings and light poles, left to flutter softly in the breeze.  
即便相隔甚远，她也能清晰地看到它已被打开，舱门躺在沙地上，而其巨大的降落伞则散落在废墟和路灯之间，随风轻轻飘动。

BANG 砰

She stopped, that unfamiliar sound causing her to pause. It was a constant repetition, rhythmic almost, but she didn't stay still for long, starting up again and quickening her pace.  
她停了下来，那陌生的声音让她顿住了脚步。那声音持续不断，近乎有节奏，但她并未久留，随即重新迈步，加快了步伐。

BANG 砰

Finally reaching it, she didn't see Ikari anywhere, before going around the plug only to discover the source of the noise.  
终于到达那里，她四处张望却不见碇的身影，绕过插入栓后才发现噪音的来源。

BANG 砰

It was Shinji, teeth clenched, slamming his fist again the metal of the entry plug. Asuka guessed he must have been doing it for some time, the suit material around his fingers had been torn, leaving loose wiring hanging out. It was jarring to see him in such a dark pursuit when she had only ever seen him in his blue one. He must have noticed her, because he stopped, allowing himself to against the metal cylinder with his other arm. He refused to look at her, though, instead he kept his eyes averted, a shame-filled look on his face.  
那是真嗣，紧咬牙关，拳头重重地砸在插入栓的金属壁上。明日香猜测他一定已经这样做了很久，他手指周围的装甲材料已被撕裂，露出松散的电线。看到他在这种阴暗的追求中，而她只见过他穿着蓝色的那套，这让她感到震惊。他一定是注意到了她，因为他停了下来，用另一只手臂靠在金属圆柱上。然而，他拒绝看她，反而将目光移开，脸上带着羞愧的表情。

"Hey, Asuka." “嘿，明日香。”

She clenched her jaw, stepping forward and grabbing the front of his suit before pulling back her arm and releasing the hardest punch she could at that stupid face.  
她紧咬牙关，向前一步抓住他制服的前襟，然后挥起手臂，用尽全力向那张愚蠢的脸狠狠地打了一拳。

He let it happen, even she knew he could have stopped her, it was sloppy form. Even though her leg didn't explode in pain at that very moment, she was sure it would be reminding her of that punch sooner rather than later.  
他任由这一切发生，即便她知道他本可以阻止她，这动作太不严谨了。尽管她的腿当时并未因那一击而剧痛，但她确信很快就会感受到那拳的后果。

Shinji stumbled backward from the strike, taking a moment before righting himself and rubbing his jaw.  
真嗣被这一击打得向后踉跄，稍作调整后才站稳，揉了揉下巴。

"'Hey Asuka'?" She shouted, "That's all?!"  
“嘿，明日香？”她喊道，“就这样吗？！”

She swung again, this time hitting the other side of his face. Now this time both of them recoiled in pain as she felt her leg protest her movements. How fitting for the two of them.  
她再次挥动，这次击中了他的另一侧脸颊。现在，两人都因疼痛而退缩，她感到自己的腿在抗议她的动作。这对他们俩来说真是再合适不过了。

She let herself lean against the side of the entry plug glaring dagger at the boy while breathing heavily. "Tell me why," she paused, catching her breath and watching him straighten up, "I shouldn't just leave you here."  
她让自己靠在插入栓的侧面，目光如刀般盯着男孩，呼吸沉重。“告诉我，”她停顿了一下，喘口气，看着他挺直身子，“我为什么不应该就这样把你留在这里。”

He straightened up again, this time no longer looking away. Those tired blue eyes met one another, each wanting to say so much, but neither could bring themselves to say what they truly wanted to.  
他再次挺直了身子，这一次不再回避目光。那双疲惫的蓝眼睛相互对视，彼此都有千言万语想要倾诉，却谁也无法鼓起勇气说出心底最真切的话。

"Why'd you do it?" "你为什么要这么做？"

He looked away, shame again filling his face for some reason.  
他转过头去，不知为何脸上再次充满了羞愧。

"You tried to protect me, but you piloted for your father and…"  
"你想保护我，但你却为你父亲驾驶，而且……"

"NOT for him." Shinji interrupted, his head snapping back up as he finally spoke.  
"不是为了他。" 真嗣打断道，他的头猛地抬起，终于开口了。

"Then what was that?!" Asuka asked, her voice raising to meet his, "Why the hell would you get in their Eva?!"  
"那刚才那是什么？！" 明日香问道，她的声音提高以回应他，"你他妈为什么要进入他们的 Eva？！"

Asuka noticed his jaw clench, why was this so hard? She could tell he was going to answer, that he wanted to answer, but why wasn't he? Why was he still trying to hide?  
明日香注意到他的下巴紧绷，为什么这件事这么难？她能感觉到他想要回答，他想要解释，但为什么他不说话？为什么他还在试图隐藏？

"You promised, Shinji, you promise you'd tell me everything." Asuka said, pushing herself off the entry plug, "As far as Misato's concerned, you're an agent of NERV. So, if you want to live, you better start explaining. I want all of it, who you are, what you know, and what the hell you did 10 years ago." Asuka lashed out, no more secrets, no more of these half-truths.  
"你答应过的，真嗣，你答应过会把一切都告诉我。" 明日香从插入栓中起身，说道，"在美里看来，你是 NERV 的特工。所以，如果你想活下去，最好开始解释。我要知道全部，你是谁，你知道什么，还有十年前你到底做了什么。" 明日香厉声说道，不再有秘密，不再有这些半真半假的话。

"What do you think?" Shinji asked.  
"你怎么想？" 真嗣问道。

"What?" she blinked. “什么？”她眨了眨眼。

"Who do you think I am?" Shinji asked again.  
"你以为我是谁？" 真嗣再次问道。

"What do I think?" Asuka repeated, before reaching out, poking her finger in his chest, hoping the boy in front of her would understand exactly what she was telling him now. "I think I can't trust you anymore. Every time I think I can start trusting you…" she stopped, trying to find the words, but failing.  
"我怎么想？" 明日香重复道，随即伸出手，用手指戳了戳他的胸口，希望眼前这个男孩能明白她此刻想要传达的意思。"我觉得我再也无法信任你了。每次我觉得可以开始信任你的时候……" 她停了下来，试图找到合适的词句，却未能如愿。

She sighed, pulling her arm back, "I'm done Shinji. No more lies, no more secrets, because I can't do this anymore."  
她叹了口气，收回手臂，"我受够了，真嗣。不再有谎言，不再有秘密，因为我再也承受不了这些了。"

Shinji looked at her, no, examined her, like he was looking for something in her face. It was the opposite of what it had been like years ago, when he seemed to read her with nothing but a simple glance, and a part of her yearned for that again.  
真嗣看着她，不，审视着她，仿佛在她的脸上寻找着什么。这与多年前截然不同，那时他似乎只需一个简单的眼神就能读懂她，而她内心的一部分渴望着那种感觉再次回归。

Slowly he just nodded, "Ok. The truth."  
他缓缓地点了点头，“好。真相。”

"The truth." She echoed. “真相。”她重复道。

He looked around them and then up to the sky. The sun was falling, it was still light out, but it was midafternoon.  
他环顾四周，然后抬头望向天空。太阳正在西沉，天色尚亮，但已是午后时分。

"We should get moving." “我们该动身了。”

"What? No." Asuka said angrily, "You're going to explain yourself now!"  
“什么？不行。”明日香生气地说，“你现在得解释清楚！”

"It's not a short story, I'd like to do it somewhere else," Shinji countered, turning and starting to climb back up into his entry plug, "Where was that survival bag stored?"  
"这不是一篇短篇小说，我想在别的地方写，" 真嗣反驳道，转身开始爬回他的插入栓，"那个生存包存放在哪里？"

"You don't know?" Asuka said, half mockingly and half amazed he didn't know something so simple. "If your model is anything like mine it's in a rear compartment behind the seat."  
"你不知道吗？" 明日香说，半是嘲讽半是惊讶他连这么简单的事都不知道。"如果你的型号和我的类似，那就在座位后面的后备箱里。"

He nodded, jumping into the entry plug, only taking a moment before he hopped back over the side wearing the shoulder bag.  
他点点头，跳进插入栓，只花了一会儿工夫就又跳了出来，肩上已经背上了那个挎包。

"Where are we going?" he asked.  
"我们去哪儿？" 他问道。

"Nowhere till…" "哪儿也不去，直到……"

"Asuka, I'm serious." He said, pulling the bag around to his chest so he could dig through it, "Unless Wunder is coming to get us right now, I don't want NERV to come looking for us here."  
"明日香，我是认真的。" 他说着，将背包转到胸前以便翻找，"除非 Wunder 现在就来接我们，否则我不想让 NERV 在这里找到我们。"

He was right, if they could track his entry plug they would need to move soon. Asuka just grumbled and pulled her pack around her body to rummage through it.  
他说得没错，如果他们能追踪到他的插入栓，他们就得尽快行动。明日香只是咕哝了一声，将背包拉到身前翻找起来。

"Alright," she said, pulling out a small rectangular device. Activating it, the main circular screen gave her an arrow pointing north towards the nearest purified area and estimating a distance of 30 kilometers. On the lower half of the device, five rollers showed just how strong of an L barrier they were in. It just confirmed what she had thought before, they weren't going to receive any help.  
“好的，”她说着，掏出一个细长的矩形装置。启动后，主圆形屏幕上显示出指向北方最近净化区的箭头，并估算出距离为 30 公里。设备下半部分的五个滚轮则显示了他们所处 L 屏障的强度。这证实了她之前的想法，他们无法得到任何援助。

"We have a lot of ground to cover," Asuka said, receiving no answer. Looking up she saw what was drawing Shinji's attention. A few paces away in a dark plug suit similar to Shinji's, an Ayanami-type just stood there silently, a survival pack around her torso.  
"我们还有很多地方要探索，" 明日香说道，但没有得到回应。她抬头一看，发现是什么吸引了真嗣的注意力。几步之外，一个穿着与真嗣相似的黑色插入栓服的绫波型，就那样静静地站在那里，腰间挂着一个生存包。

"You're that pilot that ejected, right?" Asuka asked, but received no response.  
"你就是那个弹射逃生的驾驶员吧？" 明日香问道，但没有得到回答。

"What should we do about her?" Shinji asked quietly.  
"我们该怎么处理她？" 真嗣轻声问道。

"Has she done anything other than stare at us?"  
"她除了盯着我们看，还做过什么吗？"

"No." Shinji replied, shrugging, "She didn't seem like much of a threat when I was her prisoner either."  
"没有。" 真嗣回答，耸了耸肩，"我作为她的俘虏时，她看起来也没什么威胁。"

"Well the extra supplies wouldn't hurt, it's not like she won't be able to keep up," Asuka grumbled, rubbing her leg. "C'mon, we're losing daylight."  
"额外的补给也没什么坏处，她应该能跟上，" 明日香咕哝着，揉了揉腿。"快点，天快黑了。"

The two of them started walking, with the Ayanami clone keeping a few paces away. Asuka didn't really care, this wasn't going to be an easy, short, or painless journey and she didn't need to hear the comments of a barely functional clone as they hiked through the corpse of a dead civilization.  
两人开始行走，绫波零的克隆体保持着几步的距离。明日香并不在意，这不会是一次轻松、短暂或无痛的旅程，她不需要在穿越这个死寂文明的残骸时，听到一个功能不全的克隆体的评论。

**I'm not going to lie; this could have been out way sooner. Whenever I had a little time to actually work on it, I would just keep opening it, staring at it, then tabbing out. Not an excuse, but it's the truth. The parts that are most important are good, but the rest is mediocre whenever I read them.  
我不会撒谎；这本可以早点完成的。每当我有一点时间真正去处理它时，我总是打开它，盯着它，然后切换出去。这不是借口，但这是事实。最重要的部分是好的，但其余部分我读起来总觉得平庸。**

**Also, anyone know what that compass device Asuka uses at the end of 3.0 and beginning of 4.0 is called?  
另外，有人知道明日香在 3.0 结尾和 4.0 开头使用的那个罗盘装置叫什么吗？**

**UltraSpink of Da USA – Thanks! I think the next chapter will be the very special one.  
美利坚超旋风 – 谢谢！我想下一个chapter将会是非常特别的。**

**5queso – Thanks! Yeaaaah... about that.  
5queso – 谢谢！耶……关于那个嘛。**

**skyf0x – Thank you always for the long review! Thank you for pointing out that Kaworu line, that is an error. I think I forgot to cross examine the dub and sub for that because that is the dub line, but it makes no sense. It has since been edited. I'm glad you enjoyed the chapter!  
skyf0x – 感谢您一如既往的长篇评论！感谢您指出那个渚薰的台词错误，那确实是个疏忽。我想我忘了对照检查英文配音和日语字幕，因为那是英文配音的台词，但那样说不通。现在已经修正了。很高兴您喜欢《chapter》！**

**Guest(1) – Thanks! I'm gonna do something interesting with Kaji. As for a time travel Asuka story… I don't dislike it, I think I've seen one or two of them. I did think a little about what it would be like, but I never had been serious about writing one. The story itself is interesting, the constraints you'd set out for yourself are probably the hardest aspect. I would certainly stick with NGE and Soryu. When do you have her come back, why, and (really the worst question) how? It'd maybe be a bit easier to right, (if its done in a classic way with just the 'return to start' style instead of a loop) mainly because of Asuka's failings and troubles even after her realization before the NGE fight, that behavior doesn't just go away magically. It'd be a different kind of story, I'd certainly would plan it to be as short as possible if I were to do it.  
Guest(1) – 谢谢！我打算和加持做些有趣的事。至于时间旅行的明日香故事……我不讨厌，我想我看过一两个。我确实稍微想过会是什么样子，但从未认真考虑过写一个。故事本身很有趣，你为自己设定的限制可能是最难的部分。我肯定会坚持使用《新世纪福音战士》和惣流。你让她何时回来，为何回来，以及（最棘手的问题）如何回来？如果用经典的“回到起点”方式而不是循环，可能会稍微容易些，主要是因为明日香在 NGE 战斗前的觉悟后仍有失败和困扰，那种行为不会神奇地消失。这将是一个不同类型的故事，如果我来做，我肯定会计划尽可能简短。**

**engel17white – Thanks! I doubt this Shinji would ever go catatonic, but that doesn't mean he won't be feeling isolated in the near future since he basically hasn't done himself any favors, but can you blame the guy? He was given an opportunity to stop the cycle and although Kaworu was honest about that, even he is fallible, being in the same situation as Shinji in some way.  
engel17white – 谢谢！我怀疑这个版本的真嗣永远不会变得紧张症，但这并不意味着他不会在不久的将来感到孤立，毕竟他基本上没有为自己做任何好事，但你能怪他吗？他得到了一个打破循环的机会，尽管渚薰对此是诚实的，甚至他自己也有缺陷，在某种程度上与真嗣处于相同的境地。**

**Calborghete – Thanks! Shinji certainly didn't do himself any favors, though I don't think it's Gendo's manipulations that really screwed up the situation, at least not directly for Shinji. It's really Kaworu's fault, and Gendo's plan for Kaworu that really screws Shinji as well as (if you picked this up) maybe Kaworu's knowledge being incomplete as well?  
Calborghete – 谢谢！真嗣确实没有为自己做任何好事，不过我认为真正搞砸了局面的是渚薰，而不是碇源堂的操纵，至少不是直接对真嗣而言。实际上是渚薰的错，以及碇源堂对渚薰的计划，这些都让真嗣陷入了困境（如果你注意到了的话），或许渚薰的知识也不完整？**

**Guest(2)- A very angry Asuka.  
Guest(2)- 一个非常愤怒的明日香。**

**Guest(3)- Indeed, Shinji got vibe checked.  
Guest(3)- 确实，真嗣被气场压制了。**

**Lebeauf- First review, NICE! Yeah, 4.0 actually really helped me out tbh.  
Lebeauf- 第一次评论，太棒了！是啊，4.0 版本真的帮了我大忙，说实话。**

**Attila1987- Yep! Shinji seriously dug himself a hole with WILLE, but we'll see if Asuka learning the truth helps, or could just make things worse. Mari and Misato seem to think he's crazy at best, what would Asuka think when he opens up?  
Attila1987- 没错！真嗣在 WILLE 那里真是自掘坟墓，但我们会看看明日香得知真相是否会有所帮助，或者只会让事情变得更糟。玛丽和美里似乎认为他最多只是疯了，当真嗣敞开心扉时，明日香会怎么想呢？**

**Alfredo12StarLegionaire- Thanks for the review, very true gripes. I enjoy the 'time is a river, you have to throw in a big enough rock to divert it' style of explaining time. The world doesn't know about Shinji, like a random person in NA wouldn't know the details of the N3I. Misato believes it more out of grief if anything, she more so picked up the evidence and ran with it while a certain someone who had firsthand experience with Shinji being mysterious had/has doubts. 4.0 is going to be drastically different (like wtf happened to Cassius where is it? They only got two full Evas, you think Shinji really is gonna sit in a cell? What's up with Shikinami? And is Kaji still around?), the 4.0 'arc' was outlined when only the trailer was out, some some aspects will be retained since they worked well with ideas already though about, ie Anti Universe.  
Alfredo12StarLegionaire- 感谢你的点评，确实指出了不少痛点。我挺喜欢那种“时间如河流，需投下足够大的石头才能改变流向”的时间解释方式。世界对真嗣一无所知，就像北美随便一个人不会了解 N3I 的细节一样。美里更多是因为悲伤而相信，她其实是捡起证据就跑，而某个与真嗣神秘经历直接相关的人则持有/一直持有怀疑态度。4.0 将会截然不同（比如卡西乌斯怎么了？它去哪儿了？他们只有两台完整的 EVA，你觉得真嗣真的会乖乖坐在牢房里吗？式波又是怎么回事？加持还在吗？）。4.0 的“篇章”在预告片刚出来时就已大致勾勒，有些方面会保留，因为它们与已有的构思相契合，比如反宇宙概念。**

**Juicy Juice Part 2 – I have been lacking, thanks for the review.  
多汁果汁 第二部分 – 我有所欠缺，感谢你的评论。**

**HeroesTale2 – Yes, Shinji's pendant is the one NGE Misato gave to him in EoE. Rebuild Misato does not acknowledge the pendant when it's more brazen. Mostly because she's not too keen on being close with Asuka after she wakes up, Asuka doesn't usually wear it outside of her clothes like Misato does, and also even if she did really think about the pendant, Shinji's is pretty old with wear and tear on it. While it's weird, and lots possible in Eva, I doubt Misato's reaction to it would be 'That's my pendant!'.  
英雄传说 2 – 没错，真嗣的吊坠正是《EVA》旧剧场版中美里送给他的那枚。在《EVA》新剧场版中，美里对这吊坠的反应并不明显。主要是因为她在明日香苏醒后不太愿意与她亲近，明日香也不像美里那样经常将吊坠露在外面，而且即便她真的注意到吊坠，真嗣的那枚因岁月磨损已经相当陈旧。虽然这种情况有些奇怪，且《EVA》中可能性众多，但我怀疑美里对它的反应会是：“那是我的吊坠！”。**

**I know it's been slow, but things aren't looking like they're going to change too soon. Lots of changes and stuff going on IRL as well as some smaller things I want to finish soon too. What does that mean? Probably don't expect the next chapter super soon, I'd like to go forwards kinda like how I did the first section, writing a few chapters ahead. The updates will come, just not fast (or faster than they have been), but don't worry it's not like the story's going to take 10 years, we'll get there.  
我知道进度有点慢，但事情似乎不会很快有所改变。现实生活里有很多变动，还有一些我想尽快完成的小事。这意味着什么呢？可能不要期待下一篇《一千零一夜》会很快出炉，我希望能像写第一部分那样，提前写好几章。更新会来的，只是不会太快（或者比现在更快），但别担心，故事不会拖上十年，我们终会到达那里的。**

**Until Next Time 下次再见**


### Chapter 61: "We had joy, we had fun…"  
Chapter 61: “我们曾拥有欢笑，我们曾享受乐趣……”

"Hey, let's skip class today."  
“嘿，今天逃课吧。”

Asuka quirked her head and just stared at him through the reflection in the mirror, the toothbrush in her mouth coming to a stop for a moment. After spitting she looked back up at the mirror and again looked at him like he had grown a second head.  
明日香歪了歪头，透过镜子里的反射只是盯着他，嘴里的牙刷一时停了下来。吐掉泡沫后，她再次抬头看向镜子，又像他长出了第二个脑袋似的看着他。

"Who are you and what have you done with Shinji Ikari?" She asked, whipping her face with a towel.  
“你是谁，你对碇真嗣做了什么？”她问道，用毛巾擦着脸。

Shinji smiled; she could be cute when she let her guard down. "We're ahead, we don't need to go. Misato even congratulated us on our grades."  
真嗣笑了；她放下戒备时真的很可爱。“我们领先了，不需要赶过去。美里甚至还祝贺了我们的成绩。”

As it turns out, taking the same grade level over and over again made it pretty easy to earn perfect scores, though he had to make it seem like he was making an effort, it'd be suspicious if he suddenly got top marks. School had somehow found a way to become even more boring than before his journey through multiple lives.  
事实证明，重复上同一个年级使得取得满分变得相当容易，尽管他不得不装出努力的样子，否则突然获得最高分会显得可疑。学校不知怎的，竟然比他在多次生命旅程中还要无聊。

However, helping Asuka with her Japanese always helped make things more exciting.  
然而，帮助明日香学习日语总能给事情增添些许乐趣。

"Who are you and what have you done with Shinji Ikari?" she asked, whipping at her mouth with a towel, "Since when are you jumping to be a delinquent?"  
“你是谁，你对碇真嗣做了什么？”她用毛巾擦拭着嘴巴问道，“你什么时候开始变得像个不良少年了？”

He just smiled and leaned against the doorframe, he had already been up for some time, although that had left him with the dangerous task of waking Asuka up. It wasn't often she didn't get up at her typical routine time, but considering Leliel's arrival the day before it was understandable. Luckily today it wasn't too treacherous of a task, since she had the smell of breakfast greeting her when he gently shook her awake.  
他只是微笑着，斜靠在门框上，其实已经起床一段时间了，尽管这意味着他得冒着风险去叫醒明日香。她不按常规时间起床并不常见，但考虑到前一天 Leliel 的出现，这还是可以理解的。幸运的是，今天这项任务并不太艰险，因为当他轻轻摇醒她时，早餐的香味已经迎面而来。

"C'mon, how many hours did you go without sleep while I was in that Angel? You deserve a day off." He countered.  
“来吧，我在那个使徒里的时候，你有多少个小时没睡？你今天应该休息一天。”他反驳道。

Asuka raised an eyebrow as she turned and pushed past him to go to her room and change. Shinji couldn't help but smile to himself while he went to his own room. "I never thought you'd be the one to argue about _not_ going to school Asuka. Whatever happened to 'I went to college'?"  
明日香挑了挑眉，转身推开他，走向自己的房间换衣服。真嗣忍不住自顾自地笑了，然后回到自己的房间。“我从没想过你会是那个争论不去上学的人，明日香。你不是总说‘我上过大学’吗？”

"Oh you're one to talk mister, 'I don't need to study'." She called back.  
"哦，你倒是会说，‘我不需要学习’先生。" 她回喊道。

Shinji snorted, "So you're just scared of what Misato will say?" Shinji asked, sliding open his bedroom door.  
真嗣哼了一声，"所以你只是害怕美里会说什么？" 真嗣问道，拉开自己的卧室门。

To his lack of surprise, Asuka was standing in her bedroom's doorway with a smirk. Her school uniform was nowhere to be found, instead, she sported a simple outfit of shorts and a light t-shirt.  
不出他所料，明日香正站在她卧室的门口，脸上带着一丝得意的笑容。她的校服不见踪影，取而代之的是一条短裤和一件轻薄的 T 恤。

"Looks like I got my answer then," Shinji said, gesturing to the hallway. She gladly took point, walking out to the kitchen only to be met with a confused Pen-Pen.  
“看来我得到了答案。”真嗣说道，指向走廊。她欣然领头，走向厨房，却迎面碰上了困惑的 Pen-Pen。

"We'll be back later buddy," Shinji said, crouching down and patting his head just to be met with the usual squawk.  
“我们晚点回来，伙计。”真嗣蹲下拍了拍它的头，回应他的依旧是那熟悉的嘎嘎声。

At the front door, Asuka already had her shoes on and was tapping her foot impatiently. He felt no need to rush and took his time retying his shoes.  
在门口，明日香已经穿好鞋，不耐烦地用脚尖敲打着地面。他并不觉得需要匆忙，慢条斯理地重新系好鞋带。

"C'mon, don't waste time with that, hurry up."  
"快点，别在那上面浪费时间，赶紧的。"

"We've got all the time in the world." He said, finishing and standing up. Only he knew what his words truly meant in that moment.  
"我们有的是时间。" 他说着，结束并站起身来。只有他知道那一刻他的话真正意味着什么。"

"Well, what did you have in mind?" Asuka asked as they both stepped out of the apartment into the warm air.  
"那么，你有什么打算？" 明日香问道，他们一起走出公寓，步入温暖的空气中。"

"I've got a few ideas," Shinji said with a smile as he took her hand in his and the two of them headed to the elevator.  
"我有一些想法，" 真嗣微笑着说，他握住她的手，两人一起走向电梯。

**A full-length Chapter 62 will be up later this week, I'll do a proper author's note there.  
本周晚些时候会有一篇完整的Chapter 62，届时我会写一个正式的作者笔记。**

### Chapter 62 "…I gazed a gazeless stare…"  
Chapter 62 "…我凝视着无目的凝视…"

Shinji thought he had lived through the apocalypse once before, a lifeless world that had been destroyed by his own hand. He thought he'd only have to experience it again in his dreams, but as they trekked along the red-stained landscape a sickening feeling crept into his gut. The post-instrumentality world he knew could be described using many words, but with every step, he felt the repulsive yearning for that world instead.  
真嗣曾以为自己经历过一次末日，一个被他自己亲手摧毁的死寂世界。他以为那只会出现在梦中，但随着他们穿越这片血染的大地，一种令人作呕的感觉悄然爬上他的心头。他所熟悉的后补完世界可以用许多词汇来形容，但每走一步，他都感到一种对那个世界的厌恶渴望。

Each object, organic, non-organic, synthetic, or natural was spared from what Asuka called 'coreification', a condition that had spread from the epicenter of the Near-Third Impact. He had pressed for more answers, but had been turned down with a cold 'Later', and 'Rei' didn't seem to have any answers for him either, remaining quiet even when spoken to directly.  
每一件物体，无论是生物性的、非生物性的、合成的还是自然的，都免于被明日香称为‘核心化’的状态，这种状况从近三次冲击的中心蔓延开来。他曾追问更多答案，却只得到一个冷冰冰的‘待会儿’和‘绫波’似乎也对他无言以对，即使直接问话也保持沉默。

He noted the peculiarities of the broken world around him as they traveled. Debris ranging from cars to entire powerlines seemed to hover in midair, floating up and down gently in a lazy defiance of the laws of physics. Shinji wondered if they too would be affected by such anomalies, but by the way Asuka seemed to lead them around such things, he doubted it did any good asking.  
他们在旅途中，他注意到了周围破碎世界的种种奇特之处。从汽车到整条电线，各种残骸似乎都悬浮在半空中，轻轻地上下漂浮，懒洋洋地违背着物理定律。真嗣想知道他们是否也会受到这种异常现象的影响，但看到明日香似乎有意避开这些东西，他怀疑问了也没什么用。

Since they were traveling light, with only their survival packs slung over their shoulders, he figured the 30-kilometer journey would be relatively straightforward, and at points it was, but more often than not the march was laborious. Sometimes the roads would be intact, allowing them to make reasonable progress, but the widespread destruction meant that the amount of time spent finding alternative routes to broken landscapes or the ruins of collapsed infrastructure was mounting as they went.  
由于他们轻装上阵，仅肩挎生存背包，他原以为这段 30 公里的旅程会相对轻松，而某些路段确实如此，但更多时候这段行程颇为艰辛。有时道路完好，他们能顺利前行，但广泛的破坏意味着他们花费大量时间寻找绕过破损地貌或坍塌基础设施的替代路线，随着行程推进，这种情况愈发频繁。

Japan's mountainous terrain didn't help matters either, after the first ridge with a switchback they had to climb all three of them needed a break. Shinji noted just how out of shape he felt while Rei's face uncharacteristically showed just how much she needed a break. When Shinji looked at Asuka however, she had already turned away from them, looking out over the next valley while looking at that device she had been using to lead them.  
日本的山区地形也未曾带来任何便利，翻越第一个带有回旋的山脊后，他们三人全都不得不停下来休息。真嗣注意到自己感到多么不适应，而绫波的脸色也罕见地显露出她多么需要休息。然而，当真嗣看向明日香时，她已经转过身去，眺望着下一个山谷，同时注视着她用来引领他们的那台设备。

He knew she was trying to hide any form of weakness from them. It was something he would expect her to do, but he could tell she was in more pain than the two of them. Her limp had only gotten worse throughout the day and now she was doing her best to clutch her leg in the least noticeable way possible. None of them said anything for a few minutes as they caught their breath, only when Asuka started heading down did they continue.  
他知道她在努力隐藏任何形式的脆弱。这是他会预料到的她的行为，但他能看出她比他们俩承受着更多的痛苦。她的跛行一整天都在恶化，现在她正尽力以最不引人注意的方式紧抓着她的腿。他们沉默了几分钟，只是喘着气，直到明日香开始下山，他们才继续前行。

They kept going like that for hours, avoiding obstacles, heading up cliffsides, taking short rests, and before long the sun was starting to cast longer shadows on the ruins around them. As the sun set, he noted he could see his breath and the wind began to carry a heavier chill than he was comfortable with.  
他们就这样持续了几个小时，避开障碍，攀登峭壁，短暂休息，不久太阳开始在周围的废墟上投下更长的影子。随着太阳落山，他注意到自己能看到呼出的气息，风开始带来比他感到舒适的更重的寒意。

Finally, when the sun began to touch the horizon Asuka stopped at a relatively intact intersection. Around them were a handful of untouched structures, small convenience stores, and a gas station.  
最终，当太阳开始触及地平线时，明日香在一个相对完好的十字路口停下。周围有几座未受损的建筑，小便利店和一座加油站。

"We'll stop here for the night," Asuka said, pulling her bag around her body so she could reach inside and put away her device.  
“我们今晚就在这儿歇脚，”明日香说着，将背包转到身前，以便伸手进去收好她的设备。

She went straight to one of the convenience stores, it was certainly the most intact of the buildings, but there was enough damage that Shinji couldn't make out the name it had once held. The inside of the store was devoid of any food or supplies, every shelf was empty and either pushed against a wall or knocked over. It wasn't exactly a loss for them, after all, nothing would be useful, the structure was useful enough, sheltering them from the increasing winds and chill air.  
她径直走向一家便利店，那无疑是建筑中保存最完好的一栋，但仍有不少损坏，以至于真嗣无法辨认它曾经的名字。店内没有任何食物或补给，每层货架都空空如也，要么被推到墙边，要么倒在地上。对他们来说，这并不算损失，毕竟没有什么是有用的，这结构本身已足够提供庇护，让他们免受愈发猛烈的风和寒气侵袭。

Asuka knelt down, pulled a green metallic object from her survival pack, and placed it on the floor. She fiddled with it for a few seconds before a flame came to life, giving them some light against the encroaching darkness.  
明日香蹲下身，从她的生存包里掏出一个绿色金属物体，放在地上。她摆弄了几秒钟，一簇火焰便燃了起来，为他们驱散了逼近的黑暗。

Shinji sat down around the small flame as she pushed herself back, both did their best to build some sort of backing for their own comfort while 'Rei' just stood at the entrance looking at them.  
真嗣围坐在小火堆旁，她将自己往后挪了挪，两人都尽力为自己搭建一些舒适的靠背，而‘绫波’只是站在入口处看着他们。

"Go ahead and sit down," Shinji said, gesturing to the floor.  
“坐下吧，”真嗣说道，示意地板。

The girl slowly did so, Shinji swore her blank face would put the real Rei to shame. It was like she didn't know how to be anything, let alone human. He had never come across such a strange version of her clone before. She should at least have some of the real Rei's memories, but what if Gendo felt there was no need to do that?  
女孩缓缓坐下，真嗣发誓她那空洞的脸庞足以让真正的绫波感到羞愧。她似乎不知道如何表现出任何情感，更不用说像个人了。他从未遇到过如此奇怪的她的克隆版本。她至少应该有一些真正绫波的记忆，但如果碇源堂觉得没有必要这么做呢？

He pushed the questions out of his mind, there were more important things to think about right now, namely how he'd go about explaining himself. The question tore through him like an AT Field, it wasn't so much explaining, it was the reaction he dreaded.  
他暂时将那些疑问抛诸脑后，眼下有更重要的考虑，主要是如何解释自己。这个问题如同一道 AT 力场撕裂他的内心，与其说是解释，不如说他更害怕对方的反应。

The three of them sat there in silence for some time, only the occasional gust of wind shaking the structure being the only sound between them. The flame flickered in the darkness, casting dancing shadows around them in the hollowed-out building. Each of their faces were accented by the small amount of light, emphasizing their features and giving each of them a sickly look.  
三人沉默地坐在那里许久，只有偶尔一阵风拂过，摇动着四周的结构，成为他们之间唯一的声响。火焰在黑暗中闪烁，在废弃的建筑内投下跳跃的影子。微弱的光线勾勒出他们每个人的面容，突显出各自的特征，使他们看起来都显得有些病态。

Eventually his lips moved on their own at first, perhaps his body finally had enough of hiding everything he was, or maybe he just felt it was fair to her.  
最终，他的嘴唇先自行动了动，或许是他的身体终于受够了隐藏一切，又或许是他觉得对她公平些。

"You're a better pilot than me."  
"你比我飞得好。"

"Hmm?" Asuka's head perked up, whether it was the exhaustion of the day finally getting to her or she had been just as lost in thought, he would never know, but she was certainly unaware of the gravity of the truth that was about to be laid on her.  
"嗯？" 明日香的头突然抬起，不知是因为一天的疲惫终于袭来，还是她也陷入了沉思，他永远不会知道，但她显然没有意识到即将摆在她面前的真相有多么沉重。

"You're a better pilot than me Asuka," Shinji repeated, "the truth is I learned so much from you."  
"你比我更出色的飞行员，明日香，" 真嗣重复道，"事实上，我从你那里学到了很多。"

She frowned, "Flattery isn't going to get you anywhere, you think I forgot how easy you made it look when we spared?" she spat, "It was humiliating."  
她皱起眉头，"奉承对我没用，你以为我忘了我们练习时你表现得有多轻松吗？" 她愤愤地说，"那真是羞辱人。"

"No," Shinji's lips curled softly to an irony only he knew, "I don't think you _ever_ forgot."  
"不，" 真嗣的唇角微微上扬，流露出只有他自己才懂的讽刺，"我想你从未忘记过。"

Shinji looked up, meeting her eye which was now squarely on him. Amber flames danced in a blue he had come to love, to depend on, he took in one last sight of them before they would change forever.  
真嗣抬起头，迎上了她的目光，那双眼睛此刻正直直地盯着他。琥珀色的火焰在蓝色中跳动，那蓝色他已逐渐爱上，依赖上，他在它们永远改变之前，深深地凝视了一眼。

Before the way they would see him changed forever.  
在他永远改变他们看待他的方式之前。

"I barely remember the first time I set foot in Unit-01." Shinji mused. "I can't say I remembered much of it right after it happened, I just woke up in the medical ward, but I know I remember what it felt like, I remember how confused I was, how scared I was," Shinji explained, a slightly whimsical tone in his voice like an old man reliving his first time failing to ride a bike as a child.  
"我几乎不记得第一次踏进初号机的那一刻了。" 真嗣沉思道，"事后我也没能记得太多，只记得醒来时在医疗室，但我确实记得那种感觉，记得当时的困惑，记得当时的恐惧，" 真嗣解释着，语气中带着一丝怀旧，仿佛一个老人在回忆童年第一次学骑自行车失败的情景。

"No training, no explanation, no time. My father sent me out there simply expecting Unit-01 to go berserk. He bet his son's life on the idea that it wouldn't allow the Angel to kill me, or at least I believe that's what he was thinking." Shinji recounted, his tone changing to bitterness.  
"没有训练，没有解释，没有时间。父亲就这样把我送出去，简单地指望初号机会发狂。他用自己的儿子的生命打赌，认为它不会让使徒杀了我，或者至少我相信他是这么想的。" 真嗣回忆道，语气转为苦涩。

"Then there was Shamiel and Ramiel, I survived both by more luck than skill." He admitted.  
"然后是萨米尔和拉米尔，我能幸存下来，更多的是靠运气而非技巧。" 他承认道。

"What the hell is a Shamiel?" Asuka asked, interrupting his recollections.  
"啥玩意儿是‘沙米尔’？" 明日香打断了他的回忆。

Shinji chuckled, at the reaction, it probably mirrored his own when he learned about the silly names, however long ago that had been, "SEELE gave each Angel a designated name, or maybe they came from the Dead Sea Scrolls, I'm not really sure to be honest."  
真嗣轻笑一声，对方的反应大概和他当初得知这些滑稽名字时如出一辙，"SEELE 给每个使徒都起了个特定的名字，或者这些名字是从《死海古卷》里来的，老实说我也不太确定。"

"Scrolls?" "古卷？"

Shinji sidestepped the question, it could wait for another time, "After all that I learned, I did better, even my first brush with death didn't amount to much. Rei and I took down Ramiel, the Fifth Angel, and… it was nice…"  
真嗣避开了这个问题，它可以留待下次再谈，“毕竟我所学的一切，让我做得更好，甚至我第一次面对死亡时也没什么大不了的。我和绫波一起击倒了第五使徒雷米尔，而且……那感觉很好……”

He stared into the small flame, remembering how the LCL had begun to boil around him, stalling for only a few more seconds before continuing. "Then I met you." He said simply, "We were on a carrier, leading a fleet to deliver Unit-02 to Japan. We met for the first time then and together we took down Gaghiel, the 6th Angel."  
他凝视着那微弱的火焰，回想起 LCL 开始在他周围沸腾的情景，只拖延了几秒钟便继续说道。“然后我遇见了你。”他简单地说，“我们在一艘航母上，率领舰队将二号机运往日本。我们就是在那时第一次见面，并一起击倒了第六使徒加吉尔。”

"That's not what happened, I'm the one that killed that Angel, you had nothing to do with it!" She countered.  
“事情不是那样的，是我杀死了那个使徒，你根本没参与！”她反驳道。

Shinji didn't know if she hadn't heard him or if it was a flash of her pride for her first kill that rebuked his retelling, but a part of him just wanted her to let him finish the story, it would be less painful that way, at least for him.  
真嗣不知道她是没听见，还是因为她第一次杀敌的骄傲阻止了他重述故事，但他内心的一部分只是希望她能让他讲完，这样至少对他来说没那么痛苦。

"Please just listen," he brought his gaze back to the fire, doing his best to keep his voice steady, "Israfel, Sandalphon, Matarael, Sahaquel, and more… we worked together, fought together, protected the city together… you, Rei and me, but in the end, it all fell apart."  
“请听我说，”他重新将目光投向火堆，尽力保持声音平稳，“伊斯拉斐尔、桑达尔丰、马特拉尔、萨哈克尔，还有更多……我们一起工作，一起战斗，一起守护这座城市……你、丽和我，但最终，一切都崩溃了。”

He turned to look back at Asuka, he could tell she didn't understand what he was explaining, but then again who would? Who could possibly think that anything he would explain was even remotely possible?  
他转头看向明日香，他能看出她并不理解他在解释什么，但话说回来，谁又能理解呢？谁会认为他解释的任何事情是可能的呢？

"What you know as the Tenth Angel, I've fought it before, its name is Zeruel." He explained, "I've faced it time after time after time, but this is the first time I was stuck in the core for 10 years, it's the first time any of _this_ happened." he said gesturing to the world around them.  
"你所知的第十使徒，我曾与之战斗过，它的名字是 Zeruel。" 他解释道，"我一次又一次地面对它，但这是我第一次被困在核心中长达十年，这也是这一切首次发生。" 他边说边指着周围的世界。

"What…" "什么…"

"Let me finish." He pleaded, "The Third Impact, I… we…" he stopped, what would she think of him if he told her the truth? Did that even matter? Did he even need to explain it all? She didn't need to know what he did right now, maybe they never needed to know about it at all. What was one more secret?  
"让我说完。" 他恳求道，"第三次冲击，我…我们…" 他停了下来，如果他告诉她真相，她会怎么想？这还重要吗？他甚至需要解释这一切吗？她现在不需要知道他做了什么，也许他们永远都不需要知道这一切。再多一个秘密又如何？

"I know about my father's work because I've had lifetimes to understand it. I know about SEELE because I'm sure I've died due to them on more than one occasion. I've lived this life over and over and _over_, trying to find a way out, but every time I just find myself back at the beginning." Shinji stopped, taking a deep breath after rushing through those words, "I failed to stop the Third Impact and now I'm stuck, living and dying just to have another chance at stopping it all, and _that_ is the truth Asuka."  
“我了解我父亲的工作，因为我有无数次生命去理解它。我知道 SEELE，因为我确信不止一次因他们而死。我一遍又一遍地活过这一生，试图找到出路，但每次都发现自己回到了起点。” 真嗣停下来，在急促地说完这些话后深吸了一口气，“我没能阻止第三次冲击，现在我被困住了，生生死死只为再有一次机会去阻止这一切，这就是真相，明日香。”

It was the truth in the loosest sense of the word, but she didn't need to know that. She didn't need to hear about how he failed her, how he had failed everyone. She didn't need to hear how they had lost their minds, how they had been deceived and ruined, how the world unraveled around them and they were helpless to stop it.  
这所谓的真相不过是字面上的牵强附会，但她无需知晓这些。她不必听他如何辜负了她，如何辜负了所有人。她不必听他们如何丧失理智，如何受骗上当、走向毁灭，世界如何在周围分崩离析，而他们却无能为力。

And she didn't need to know that the person sitting next to her was the one who let it all happen.  
她无需知晓，坐在她身旁的那个人，正是这一切的幕后推手。

The wind outside was the only source of sound between the three of them now. The silence weighed on him, each second made his heart race faster and faster. What did he expect? A slap? A punch? Tears? He could only imagine the raging storm of emotions swirling in the girl's heart. A torrent of feelings that he could do nothing to quell.  
此刻，三人之间唯一的声响来自窗外的风。沉默如重石压在他心头，每一秒都让他的心跳愈发急促。他期待什么？一记耳光？一拳？还是泪水？他只能想象女孩心中翻涌的情感风暴。那股他无力平息的情感洪流。

"Screw you Ikari." “去你的，碇。”

"What?" “什么？”

"You really expect me to believe that scheisse?" she spat at him, eyes shooting daggers.  
"你真以为我会相信那套鬼话？" 她朝他啐了一口，眼中射出锋利的目光。

"Asuka it's…" "明日香，这是……"

"I don't want to hear it Third! I want to hear the truth!"  
"我不想听你解释，第三！我要听的是真相！"

"Asuka, that _is_ the truth!" Shinji protested.  
"明日香，那是真的！" 真嗣抗议道。

"Yeah right, and I've been sitting pretty enjoying Oktoberfest for the last ten years!" Asuka shouted pushing herself up off the floor clumsily.  
"是啊，对啊，过去十年我一直在优雅地享受着十月节！" 明日香大喊着，笨拙地从地板上站起来。

"Asuka," Shinji stood up as well, readying himself for some sort of slap, but it never came, instead she turned to walk out the door, "After everything, you won't even consider the possibility?"  
"明日香，" 真嗣也站了起来，准备迎接可能的一巴掌，但它并未到来，相反，她转身向门口走去，"经历了这么多，你甚至不愿意考虑这种可能性吗？"

She stopped, "Don't waste my time with your fantasies Third, I… _we_ don't have the luxury." Asuka stepped outside, while Shinji's figure deflated.  
她顿住了，“别用你的幻想浪费我的时间，三号，我……我们没有那个闲工夫。”明日香走了出去，而真嗣的身影似乎也随之萎靡。

What now? After all that what did he have left to prove what he was?  
现在怎么办？经历了这一切，他还有什么能证明自己是谁？

Shinji just shook his head and sat back down, head collapsing between his knees.  
真嗣只是摇了摇头，坐回原位，头埋在双膝之间。

"She is in pain." 'Rei's said, her monotone voice hitting him with all the grace of a screeching calkboard right then.  
"她很痛苦。" '丽'说道，她那单调的声音此刻如同刺耳的黑板摩擦声般击中了他。

"Yeah," Shinji signed, laying back and doing his best to rest his head on his bag, "and like always, it's my fault."  
"是啊，" 真嗣叹了口气，躺下并尽力将头枕在背包上，"一如既往，这都是我的错。"

**Hey, how's it going? I know it's been a while, but here's a juicy update for you. The main pain I had in this chapter was the reveal. Time travel/peggy sue fics/whatever you want to call them, tend to just info dump on other characters and when it comes to this part in particular, it feels rushed and almost always at the beginning of the story as well. So if the astute among you noticed, Shinji didn't actually reveal a whole heck of a lot and equally as important Asuka (somewhat rightfully) doesn't believe a world of it, additionally, this in true Asuka fashion, also keeps it from hurting her, because if he's done this before, then what is she to him if not just a replacement? Now Asuka and Misato both have their individual reasons for disregarding Shinji's explanation, but soon there won't be any doubt, it might even mean the two Asuka's get to meet each other hmmmm?  
嘿，最近怎么样？我知道已经有一段时间了，但这里有个劲爆的更新给你。在这篇chapter中，我最头疼的部分就是揭秘。时间旅行/佩吉苏/随便你怎么称呼这类故事，往往会在其他角色身上大量倾倒信息，而到了这个特定部分，感觉总是仓促且几乎总是在故事开头。所以如果你敏锐地注意到，真嗣实际上并没有透露太多，同样重要的是，阿斯卡（在某种程度上是合理的）并不相信这一切，此外，以阿斯卡的风格，这也让她免受伤害，因为如果他以前做过这种事，那么对她来说，她如果不是一个替代品又是什么呢？现在阿斯卡和美里都有各自的理由不相信真嗣的解释，但很快就不会有任何疑问了，这甚至可能意味着两位阿斯卡有机会见面，嗯？**

**SHOUTOUTS (so many shoutouts, this time I'm just going to list them, next time I'll respond)

**For real, sorry about the delay, I REALLY want to get back to regular updates, life's just in a weird spot now. My goal is to get a new chapter out every other week since it's not like I haven't been working on it this whole time. Hopefully, we can get back to once a week, I don't know if that is realistic yet, but I'm going to try.  
说真的，很抱歉耽搁了，我真的很想恢复定期更新，只是现在生活有点奇怪。我的目标是每隔一周发布一篇新的《一千零一夜》，毕竟这段时间我一直在努力创作。希望我们能回到每周一次的节奏，虽然我还不知道这是否现实，但我会尽力尝试。**

**Until Next Time. 下次再会。**
