(Post 3.0 1.0 One-Shot) Against her will, Asuka goes fishing. Falling asleep due to the dull task, she has a strangely pleasant dream. (R&R appreciated).  
（3.0 后 1.0 短篇）违背她的意愿，明日香去钓鱼。由于这项乏味的任务，她不知不觉睡着了，做了一个异常愉快的梦。（欢迎评论和建议）

---
"Dammit, Kenken", she cursed for the twelfth time in an hour as she slipped on a rock and almost fell down the ridge. That would be hilarious: survive fourteen years of war just to break her neck in the woods like an idiot, the end of the line for the once great Asuka Langley Shikinami. To her luck, she managed to grab a branch from a nearby tree and steady herself, immediately resuming her way down towards the river that (if her memory was correct) ran less than half a mile away.  
"该死，健健", 她在一个小时内第十二次咒骂道，因为踩到一块石头差点从山脊上摔下去。那可真是滑稽：历经十四年战争幸存下来，却像个傻瓜一样在树林里摔断脖子，曾经伟大的明日香·兰格雷·式波的结局。幸运的是，她设法抓住了附近的一根树枝稳住了自己，立刻继续向那条（如果她的记忆没错的话）距离不到半英里的河流走去。

How strangely humiliating and cathartic at the same time: once a renowned Eva pilot, now a simple woman living in a village in the back end of nowhere. Her days once filled with battle plans, military hierarchy and dirty looks from WILLE's goons now had nothing but menial tasks, smiles, stupid kids telling her that her hair looked beautiful and even more menial tasks. And of course, Kenken was responsible for most of those menial tasks.  
这种感觉既奇怪地屈辱又同时释放：曾经是一位著名的 Eva 驾驶员，如今只是一个生活在偏远村庄的普通女人。她过去的日子充满了战斗计划、军事等级制度和 WILLE 那些家伙的鄙视目光，现在却只有琐碎的任务、微笑、愚蠢的孩子们告诉她她的头发看起来很美，以及更多的琐碎任务。当然，健健是这些琐碎任务的主要负责人。

'Here, a rod and a bucket. You can get some bait at the warehouse. If there's none, just use some bread!', he had instructed, shoving the tools on her hand with an expectant smile. At that moment a big part of her wanted to use the fishing rod to beat up Kenken, but with a deep breath a few seconds of reasoning, she decided against it.  
“这里，一根钓竿和一个桶。你可以在仓库里弄些鱼饵。如果没有，用点面包也行！”他边说边把工具塞到她手里，脸上挂着期待的微笑。那一刻，她很想用钓竿揍一顿 Kenken，但深呼吸几秒后，她理智地放弃了这一念头。

The village, whether she wanted or not, was now her home: it was only reasonable that she pulled her weight. People without any use had no reason to exist… or at least, that was what she used to think. It used to be a matter of survival: to be the best meant you had the right to live another day, to eat the next meal, no matter how alone you would feel at the top.  
无论她是否愿意，这个村庄现在已是她的家：她理应尽自己的一份力。没有用处的人没有存在的理由……至少，这是她曾经的想法。过去，这是关乎生存的问题：成为最好意味着你有权活过下一天，吃上下一顿饭，无论站在顶端时有多么孤独。

Now… all those beliefs she had held during the grueling years of her life came crashing down. No one would dispose of her, no one would replace her. She was what she was, and no one else could be in her place, no matter how far from the top she was (there wasn't even a 'top' anymore). Asuka was Asuka.  
如今……那些在她艰难岁月中坚守的信念轰然崩塌。没有人会抛弃她，没有人会取代她。她就是她自己，没有人能取代她的位置，无论她离顶端有多远（现在甚至已经没有‘顶端’这一说了）。Asuka 就是 Asuka。

That didn't mean she considered _fishing_ a task worthy of her time, no matter how much the villagers appreciated it. She had never done it in her life, of course: it was a ridiculous notion, a waste of time. Surely it was easy enough: anyone could do it, even stupid Shinji. She had watched him do it dozens of times while he had lived with her and Kenken. She watched him to make sure he wouldn't do anything stupid, that he wouldn't try and escape his retribution like the cowards he was, that…  
这并不意味着她认为钓鱼值得她花时间，无论村民们多么感激。她一生中当然从未钓过鱼：这想法太荒谬了，浪费时间。肯定很容易：任何人都能做到，哪怕是愚蠢的真嗣。她曾多次看着他和她以及健健一起生活时钓鱼。她看着他是为了确保他不会做任何蠢事，不会像他那样的懦夫一样试图逃避惩罚，那……

She stopped walking and looked at the ground, suddenly feeling tired. She had hammered those notions inside of her heart for so long that the fact that they weren't true still made her dizzy. She remembered waking up at a beach, the sand below her body cool and comfortable just like the words he had spoken to her. Those words that… that…  
她停下脚步，低头看着地面，突然感到疲惫。她内心深处对这些观念的锤炼如此之久，以至于它们并非真实的事实仍让她感到眩晕。她记得在一个海滩上醒来，身下的沙子凉爽而舒适，就像他曾对她说过的话一样。那些话……那些……

Stupid. _Stupid._ 愚蠢。愚蠢。

Now he was gone, along with Four-Eyes. To where, hell if she knew. She wouldn't see them again.  
现在他走了，连同四眼一起。去哪儿了，鬼才知道。她再也见不到他们了。

The sound of current water interrupted her thoughts and separated her gritting teeth. With a sigh, she walked the remaining path and arrived at a ford with big flat rocks on both sides, perfect for sitting down and letting the job do itself. She accommodated herself on one of the rocks (the one below the shade of a tree), put the bucket and rod beside her and proceeded to remove her shoes, folding the hem of her pants. Slowly, she placed her feet on the water and let out a pleased moan at the cold temperature. She didn't care if she was scaring the fish: that feeling was worth it, damn it.  
水流的声响打断了她的思绪，也让她紧咬的牙关稍稍松开。叹了口气，她走完剩下的路，来到一处河滩，两边都是又大又平的石头，非常适合坐下来，让事情自然发展。她在一块树荫下的石头上安顿好自己，把桶和钓竿放在旁边，接着脱下鞋子，卷起裤脚。慢慢地，她将双脚浸入水中，因那冰凉的温度而发出满意的呻吟。她不在乎是否吓跑了鱼：这种感觉值得，该死的。

She sat there for a while, her eyes closed as she breathed in the air and enjoyed the water. A few times she reached the pocket of Kenken's jacket and pulled some rations, the classic tasteless food she had uselessly chomped down over the years, simply to follow the human need she had grown accustomed to before Third Impact. After a while she gave up, as she didn't need food or sleep. It all tasted the same: like nothing, be it a delicious looking meal or dry military ration.  
她坐在那里好一会儿，闭着眼睛，呼吸着空气，享受着水流。几次她伸手到碇的夹克口袋里掏出一些补给品，那些多年来她无意义地咀嚼过的经典无味食物，仅仅是为了满足在第三次冲击前她已习惯的人类需求。过了一会儿，她放弃了，因为她不需要食物或睡眠。所有东西尝起来都一样：像什么都没有，无论是看起来美味的食物还是干巴巴的军用补给。

Now that the Curse of Eva was gone and there was no Angel residing inside her, those needs came back with full force, at first to her chagrin: her stomach began to hurt frequently, and the bags under her eyes became protuberant as she sometimes simply forgot to sleep. It was something she had to get used to again, having forgotten the basics of human need over the course of more than a decade.  
如今，‘夏娃的诅咒’已解除，体内不再寄宿着使徒，那些需求便以全然的力道回归，起初让她颇为懊恼：她的胃开始频繁疼痛，眼下的黑圈变得突出，有时她甚至会忘记睡觉。这是她必须重新适应的，毕竟在超过十年的时间里，她已遗忘了人类的基本需求。

The ration still tasted like nothing, though.  
不过，那份口粮依旧尝起来毫无味道。

She sighed, deciding that she should do what she came to do, lest she hear an earful from Kenken. Not that he would berate her or anything (like she would let him, hah), but the man had a talent for making people contribute, something he wished her to do. 'Integrating her in her home', he had described. She had no strength to deny it: she had spent a many duty leaves under his roof, the least she could do was catch some stupid fish for him.  
她叹了口气，决定还是去做她来此的目的，以免被剑介唠叨个没完。倒不是说他真的会责骂她（她才不会让他得逞，哈哈），但那人擅长让人出力，这是他希望她做的。他曾形容这是‘让她融入家中’。她无力拒绝：她在他的屋檐下度过了许多假期，至少她可以为他捉些愚蠢的鱼。

She placed a bait on the hook, sinking it on the river with smooth movements. Now she just had to wait for a big and juicy fish to fall for it.  
她将饵料挂在钩上，动作流畅地将钩子沉入河中。现在她只需等待一条肥美多汁的大鱼上钩。

Whether from the lack of worries and free time she had in bulk, her mind had begun to steer towards memories and perceptions as of late. 'Juicy' was a concept almost forgotten by her, recaptured when she almost devoured in one bite a meal that the ape, of all people, had cooked alongside Hikari. Tsubame had giggled at the sight, making the redhead embarrassed as the couple laughed their asses off.  
或许是她近来无忧无虑、闲暇时间充裕，她的思绪开始转向记忆和感知。'多汁'这个概念几乎已被她遗忘，直到她差点一口吞下那只猿猴和光一起烹饪的饭菜时才重新拾起。燕看到这一幕不禁笑出声来，让红发女孩羞红了脸，而那对情侣则笑得前仰后合。

But if she forced her memory, the notion of 'tasty' or 'juicy' (or whatever it entailed) came with a mental image of small sausages, shaped like octopuses and neatly arranged inside a box. Strange places her mind wandered, even against her will: the concept of dreams, long gone, had returned, alongside their nasty brothers called nightmares.  
但如果她强迫自己去回忆，'美味'或'多汁'（或任何与之相关的）的概念会让她脑海中浮现出小香肠的形象，它们被做成章鱼的形状，整齐地排列在盒子里。她的思绪常常会不自觉地游走到奇怪的地方：那些早已消失的梦境概念又回来了，还带着它们讨厌的兄弟——噩梦。

They weren't as bad as they used to be. The dreams, pleasant ones, outnumbered the bad ones by a good margin lately. Sometimes she would dream of an apartment, of what seemed like a family. Sometimes she would dream of Four-Eyes, damn her, and the two girls sitting on the deck of the WUNDER looking at the sky. Her friend would annoy her to no end, pointing at the cosmos and wondering if the 'puppy' was waiting for her somewhere up there. Sometimes she dreamed about Misato, like she used to be back then: loud, obnoxious and irritatingly unbearably kind to her. Even if it had been just a dream, and that Misato had been long dead even before Commander Katsuragi had passed away, she preferred to remember the woman like that.  
它们不像以前那么糟糕了。近来，美好的梦境比糟糕的梦境多得多。有时她会梦见一间公寓，梦见一个家庭。有时她会梦见四眼，该死的她，还有那两个女孩坐在 WUNDER 号的甲板上仰望天空。她的朋友会没完没了地烦她，指着宇宙，想知道那只'小狗'是否在某处等着她。有时她会梦见美里，就像那时一样：大声、讨厌，却又令人难以忍受地对她好。即使那只是一个梦，即使美里在那位葛城司令去世前早已离世，她宁愿那样记住那个女人。

And sometimes she dreamed of a beach. Those she avoided thinking about.  
有时她会梦见一片海滩。那些梦她尽量避免去想。

But the sound of waves sometimes felt intoxicating. Like right at that moment, as she looked at the water flowing down the river in a hypnotic pattern. A few fishes swam around her hook, but none seemed interested in her trap. 'Too bad', she snorted. She had all day.  
但海浪的声音有时令人陶醉。就像此刻，她看着河水以一种催眠的节奏流动。几条鱼在她钩子周围游来游去，但没有一条对她的陷阱感兴趣。'真可惜'，她哼了一声。她有一整天的时间。

Her notion of time eventually faded as she sat there, her eyelids battling the sleepiness. The heat, combined with how dull her task was, didn't contribute to maintaining her consciousness. The water, clear as crystal, kept flowing and flowing alongside its calming sounds, and Asuka slowly lost the battle as she closed her eyes for a few seconds at a time. Those sights of green and blue were something she wasn't accustomed to, as she had lived in a world of silver and red for a long time. Too long.  
她对时间的感知逐渐模糊，坐在那里，眼皮与困意抗争。闷热加上任务的单调，无助于保持清醒。清澈如水晶的水流持续不断地流淌，伴随着其舒缓的声响，明日香慢慢败下阵来，一次又一次地闭上眼睛。这些绿意与蓝调的景致，是她久未习惯的，因为她长久以来生活在一个银与红的世界里。太久了。

She hoped she dreamed of something good. For as long as she could remember, it had been an unfounded hope causing her to loathe sleep. Nowadays, though, it was as welcoming as the arms of… of…  
她希望梦到些美好的事物。自她记事起，这种无根据的希望就让她厌恶睡眠。然而如今，它却如……如……的怀抱般令人向往。

…

…

…

…

"Not having much luck?", a voice asked.  
“运气不太好吗？”一个声音问道。

She slowly opened her eyes, lifting her head. Behind the blur of her eyes, she spotted a strange sight: a figure, a man, tall and with dark brown hair, sat at the opposite end of the river. The figure did the same as she did: with his dark pants folded, he dangled his feet in the water, and held some sort of blazer on his arm. Wearing a white shirt and… a tie, of all things, the man kept quiet as she analyzed him, probably expecting an answer.  
她缓缓睁开双眼，抬起头来。视线模糊中，她瞥见了一幕奇异的景象：河对岸坐着一个人，一个高大的男人，深棕色的头发，穿着深色长裤，裤脚卷起，双脚浸在水中，手臂上搭着一件西装外套。他身着白衬衫，甚至还系着领带，在她打量他时保持沉默，或许是在等待她的回应。

Her first instinct, naturally, would be to tell the guy to fuck off. She enjoyed being by herself, and if the dullness of fishing wasn't terrible enough, making small talk was probably her least favorite thing.  
她的第一反应自然是让那家伙滚开。她喜欢独处，如果钓鱼的无聊还不够糟糕，那么闲聊大概是她最不喜欢的事情了。

She opened her mouth to do just that, only to find that she didn't have the strength to do it. With a sigh, she decided to amuse the dream stranger. If he tried anything weird, he would learn how fast she could stand up to attention.  
她张开嘴正要这么做，却发现没有力气开口。叹了口气，她决定逗逗这个梦中的陌生人。如果他有什么奇怪的举动，他会见识到她反应有多快。

Besides, Kenken had asked her to be a little nicer. Accommodate herself with her neighbors. Sure, sure.  
再说了，Kenken 让她稍微友善一点。与邻居们和睦相处。当然，当然。

"Yeah, whatever", she groggily replied, stifling a yawn. "They're fish. They'll bite eventually."  
“嗯，随便吧”，她昏昏欲睡地回答，强忍住一个哈欠。“它们是鱼。迟早会咬钩的。”

"I suppose", the stranger replied, amusement in his voice. That made Asuka's brow twitch in annoyance, but she didn't react. "There are some tricks to it. Kensuke taught me."  
“我想也是”，陌生人的声音中带着笑意。这让 Asuka 的眉头因恼怒而抽动，但她没有表现出来。“有些技巧。Kensuke 教过我。”

"Oh yeah?", she answered, definitely not interested in fishing tips. Whatever weirdos Kenken had friendship with, it was none of her business. "Fascinating."  
"哦，是吗？" 她回答，绝对对钓鱼技巧不感兴趣。无论 Kenken 与哪些怪人交朋友，都与她无关。"真有趣。"

They fell into silence for a while, not a word spoken, to Asuka's relief. Eventually, Asuka's eyes began to close once again, sleep luring her towards its blissful comfort.  
他们沉默了一会儿，没有说一句话，这让明日香松了一口气。最终，明日香的眼睛再次开始闭合，睡意引诱她走向那令人愉悦的舒适。

"How have you been, Asuka?", the stranger asked, interrupting her rest. She groaned, ready to lash out at the man for…  
"你最近怎么样，明日香？" 陌生人问道，打断了她的休息。她呻吟着，准备对这个男人发火……

Wait, how did he know her name?  
等等，他是怎么知道她名字的？

She slowly lifted her head once again, now taking a good look at him: the brown hair was still there, alongside his strange clothes. Wide shoulders covered by the white shirt, below a kind face with strong features, soft in some parts and mature in others. His eyes were dark blue, a color she thought about frequently.  
她缓缓地再次抬起头，这次仔细打量起他来：棕色的头发依旧，还有他那奇怪的衣着。宽阔的肩膀被白色衬衫包裹着，下面是一张有着鲜明特征的和善面孔，某些部分柔和，某些部分则显得成熟。他的眼睛是深蓝色的，这种颜色她经常想起。

She stared at him for a long while, before softly chuckling and shaking her head.  
她盯着他看了许久，然后轻轻地笑出声，摇了摇头。

"Hey idiot", she spoke, closing her eyes and humming, still half-asleep. "Long time no see."  
"嘿，傻瓜", 她闭上眼睛哼着歌，还带着半睡半醒的迷糊。"好久不见。"

Usually her mental image of Shinji Ikari was, of course, the image she had always seen him as: a scrawny boy that looked to the ground at the mere notion of conflict. This person, an adult with mature definitions, definitely proved to her that her imagination wasn't as lacking as she thought.  
通常她脑海中的碇真嗣形象，当然是她一直以来的印象：一个瘦弱的男孩，一想到冲突就低头不语。眼前这个成熟的男人，无疑向她证明了自己的想象力并不像她以为的那样贫乏。

"Yeah", he spoke, and she could hear the smile on his voice. His deep voice, almost alien to the boy she knew. "It's been a while."  
"是啊", 他开口道，她能听出他声音中的笑意。那深沉的嗓音，几乎让她认不出那个她所熟悉的男孩。"确实很久了。"

"Uhum. Not really, though", she replied. "Few months, max."  
"嗯哼，也不算吧", 她回答道。"最多几个月。"

"Really?" "真的吗？"

"Yep", she said, yawning. "I'm good, by the way. You?"  
"是的", 她说着，打了个哈欠。"顺便说一句，我挺好的。你呢？"

"Better now, actually." "现在好多了，实际上。"

She snorted at the notion of a suave Shinji Ikari.  
她对“潇洒的真嗣”这一概念嗤之以鼻。

"Suuure", she said, giggling. 'Wait, I'm giggling?', she pondered for a moment, before clicking her tongue and mentally shrugging. Whatever. "How's Misato and Four-Eyes, by the way?"  
"当然啦", 她笑着说。'等等，我在笑吗？'她思索了一会儿，然后咂了咂舌，在心里耸了耸肩。管他呢。"话说回来，美里和四眼怎么样了？"

Shinji was silent for a moment. "Misato… well, she-"  
真嗣沉默了一会儿。"美里……嗯，她——"

"I know, I know", Asuka interrupted, sighing. She concentrated on her feet, and the feeling of the water on them. She ignored her fishing rod: in a dream, she would either catch some small fish or the Loch Ness monster. It didn't matter.  
"我知道，我知道", 明日香打断道，叹了口气。她专注于自己的双脚，以及水流拂过它们的感觉。她无视了自己的钓竿：在梦中，她要么会钓到一些小鱼，要么就是尼斯湖水怪。这都无关紧要。

"...yeah", Shinji replied, sullenly. Now _that_ was the Shinji she knew. Everything was prim and proper now. "Mari came with me. They sent me to look for you."  
"...嗯", 真嗣闷闷不乐地回答。这才是她认识的真嗣。现在一切都井井有条。"玛丽跟我一起来了。他们派我来找你。"

"Very thoughtful", she conceded. "But I'm fine on my own. Always was."  
"真是周到", 她承认道。"但我一个人挺好的。一直都是。"

"I don't really agree with that."  
"我并不完全同意这一点。"

"And what do you know?", she asked, a bit irritated. "You knew me for, what? Two months? Then you go save Wondergirl and disappear for more than a decade."  
"那你又知道些什么呢？"，她有些恼火地问道。"你才认识我多久？两个月？然后你就去救神奇女孩，消失了十多年。"

He was silent for a while. 'Hah. That will show you, idiot', she thought, distracting herself with the fish passing by her toes. 'Hm, fishies'.  
他沉默了一会儿。'哈，这回你可明白了，傻瓜'，她心想，分心地看着从她脚趾间游过的鱼。'嗯，小鱼儿们。'

"It's true", he said. "I wish we had spent more time together. Before it all happened. And after."  
"这是真的", 他说. "我真希望我们能多花些时间在一起. 在这一切发生之前. 以及之后."

"I would've punched you. A lot."  
"我本会揍你的. 很多次."

"You almost did. I got really scared, actually."  
"你差点就动手了. 实际上, 我真的吓坏了."

"Heh, you better." "哼，你最好如此。"

Silence resumed for a while. At a certain point, she lifted her eyes to spy on Shinji: he imitated her, admiring the water below. Taking a better look at him, she realized he looked a lot like his father: the broad shoulders, the strong shapes of his face, his thick eyebrows. Opposite to their past nemesis, though, Shinji seemed a lot more relaxed than his father ever had.  
沉默再次降临了一段时间。在某一刻，她抬起眼睛偷偷观察真嗣：他也模仿她，欣赏着下方的水面。仔细打量他，她发现他长得非常像他的父亲：宽阔的肩膀，坚毅的脸部轮廓，浓密的眉毛。然而，与他们过去的敌人不同，真嗣似乎比他父亲要放松得多。

And more handsome. 而且更英俊。

She sighed as a part of her resisted that confession. The cards had been laid down already, plus, this was her own mind. She owed herself some honesty.  
她叹了口气，一部分的自己抗拒着这份坦白。牌已经摊开了，而且，这是她自己的心。她欠自己一些诚实。

"You left me there." “你把我留在那里了。”

"I'm sorry?", he replied, confused.  
“对不起，你说什么？”他困惑地回答。

"Don't say that. You left me there, back then. You didn't even give me time to respond."  
"别这么说。你那时把我留在那里，甚至没给我回应的时间。"

He chuckled, embarrassed. "Yes, that's also true. I thought I was going to die."  
他尴尬地笑了笑。"“是的，那也是事实。我以为我要死了。”

"What? Why?" "什么？为什么？"

"It's complicated", he replied, not elaborating further. He looked down the river for a moment, before turning back to her. "I got lucky. I wish I didn't. Leave you there, I mean."  
"情况很复杂", 他回答道，没有进一步解释。他朝河的下游望了一会儿，然后转回来看着她。"我运气好。我希望我没有。我的意思是，把你留在那里。"

"Stupid suicidal Shinji", she yawned again. "A classic."  
"愚蠢的自杀式真嗣", 她又打了个哈欠。"经典之作。"

She lazely tugged on her rod, not really interested. No Loch monsters yet.  
她懒洋洋地拽着钓竿，并不真的感兴趣。还没有洛奇湖怪兽出现。

"I had this… fantasy, for a while."  
"我曾有过这样一个…幻想，持续了一段时间。"

"Oh?"

"Not that kind, you pervert", she chuckled. It felt good to mock him again. "After I woke up, they told me you had destroyed the world, caused Third Impact and all that. I got furious. Wanted to sock you one. Maybe kill you."  
"不是那种，你这个变态", 她轻笑道。再次嘲弄他感觉真好。"我醒来后，他们告诉我你毁灭了世界，引发了第三次冲击等等。我气得要命。想揍你一顿。或许杀了你。"

She glanced at him, seeing him nod. She continued:  
她瞥了他一眼，见他点头。她继续道：

"But… I know this sounds awful, but honestly, I didn't have much to care about before Third Impact. I got angry because everyone was angry. They had lost family, friends, loved ones. I didn't lose anything, or anyone. Except, maybe..."  
"但……我知道这听起来很糟糕，但说实话，在第三次冲击之前，我并没有太多在乎的东西。我生气是因为大家都生气。他们失去了家人、朋友、爱人。我什么也没失去，也没有失去任何人。除了，也许……"

She interrupted herself, clearing her throat. She was going too far.  
她打断了自己，清了清喉咙。她扯得太远了。

"... anyway. This idea I had", she kept explaining, now a bit embarrassed. "We would rescue you, then I would punch you really hard, and then you would fight alongside me and Four-Eyes. There. That's what I wanted to happen."  
"……总之。我这个想法", 她继续解释道，现在有点不好意思。"我们会救你，然后我会狠狠地揍你一拳，接着你会和我还有四眼一起战斗。就这样。这就是我想发生的事。"

She waited for his reply, hearing him chuckle.  
她等待着他的回复，听到他轻声笑了起来。

"That would've been nice. I wish I could've done something about it back then."  
“那会很好。我真希望当时能做些什么。”

"Yeah. But you didn't." “是啊。但你没有。”

"No, I didn't", he admitted. "When I came back, I thought I could do something to fix things up. To make everything go back to what it was."  
"不，我没有", 他承认道。"当我回来时，我以为我能做些什么来修复一切。让一切回到原来的样子。"

"That's impossible." "那是不可能的。"

"I know. I realized that later", said Shinji, moving his feet on the water. "When I decided to own up to what I did, it was almost too late. Thank you for that, Asuka."  
"我知道。后来我意识到了", 真嗣说着，在水面上移动着双脚。"当我决定承担我所做的一切时，已经几乎太晚了。谢谢你，明日香。"

"God, you were so stubborn", she groaned. "I had to resist the urge to kick your face in every time you curled up in a ball feeling sorry for yourself."  
"天哪，你真是固执得要命", 她抱怨道。"每次你蜷缩成一团自怨自艾时，我都得忍住踢你脸的冲动。"

"I wouldn't judge you!", he laughed. "I wouldn't. But thank you anyway."  
"我可不会评判你！", 他笑着说。"真的不会。但还是谢谢你。"

"You should thank me for not kicking you, actually. I was _really_ close to that."  
"其实你应该感谢我没踢你。我那时真的差点就动手了。"

"Thanks for that too." "也谢谢你这一点。"

"Hm."

A deer passed by amidst the trees. He saw the scene, two adults leisurely resting by the river, before walking away.  
一只鹿在树林间穿行而过。他目睹了这一幕：两位成年人悠闲地在河边休息，随后便走开了。

"I think I did the best I could, in the end", said Shinji, as if making an excuse. But he wasn't really: even she had to recognize that he had owned up to it.  
""我想我最终已经尽力了"", 真嗣说道，仿佛在找借口。但他并非真的如此：就连她也不得不承认，他确实承担了责任。

"Yeah. After Wondergirl goaded you into it."  
"是啊。在神奇少女激你之后。"

"It wasn't just her." "不只是她。"

"Oh? So she didn't give the Sleeping Idiot a kiss to wake him up?"  
"哦？那她没给那个沉睡的傻瓜一个吻来唤醒他吗？"

He had the gall to laugh at that.  
他居然有脸笑出声来。

"It wasn't like that, really", he explained. "She was basically my sister."  
"真的不是那样的", 他解释道, "她基本上算是我妹妹。"

"I heard something about that. Makes you kind of a weirdo."  
"我听说过那事。让你显得有点怪异。"

"I never knew what having a sister felt like. In the end, I think I did. Just for a little while."  
"我从不知道有个妹妹是什么感觉。最终，我想我体会到了。虽然只是短暂的一瞬。"

"Weirdo." "怪人。"

"You know, I heard some stuff from Mari too."  
"你知道吗，我也从玛丽那里听到了一些事情。"

She frowned at that. 'Oh, you lying bitch!'.  
她对此皱起了眉头。'哦，你这个撒谎的婊子！'.

"Four-Eyes is full of shit, you should know that by now!"  
"四眼仔满嘴胡话，你现在应该知道了吧！"

He laughed. "I figured as much."  
他笑了。"我早该料到。"

Asuka went quiet for a moment, before looking up at him with a sly smile.  
明日香沉默了一会儿，然后抬头看向他，露出了狡黠的微笑。

"Why? Would you be jealous if it were true?"  
“为什么？如果是真的，你会嫉妒吗？”

"A bit, yes." “有一点，是的。”

Asuka blushed, before chuckling. "Well, that's new."  
明日香脸颊微红，随即轻笑道：“嗯，这倒是新鲜。”

"Not really, is it? I told you back then, didn't I?"  
“其实也不算新奇吧？我那时不就告诉过你了吗？”

"Yeah… you did", she answered, taking a deep breath. She pondered for a few seconds, not really sure how to proceed.  
“是啊……你确实说过。”她深吸一口气，回答道。她沉思了几秒，不太确定接下来该如何进行。

'Fuck it', she concluded.  
'去他妈的', 她下定了决心。

"Did you mean it?" “你是认真的吗？”

He stared at her intensely, a serious look she had seen him only once: when he had decided to board the WUNDER alongside her.  
他紧紧盯着她，那种严肃的神情她只见过一次：就是他决定和她一起登上 WUNDER 的时候。

A chill went down her spine. Not a bad one, either.  
一股寒意沿着她的脊背而下。但这并非不祥之兆。

"I did. Every word. It was the end, remember? I had no reason to lie."  
"我说了。每一个字。那是结局，记得吗？我没有理由撒谎。"

"You could be just saying that on a whim."  
"你可能是心血来潮才这么说的。"

"Then why would I be here?"  
"那我为什么会在这里？"

Asuka laughed while rubbing her temples. Her fingertips got wet, and she wondered why. "Because I'm _stupid._ Even more of an idiot than you ever were."  
明日香一边揉着太阳穴一边笑了起来。她的指尖湿润了，她不知道为什么。“因为我太蠢了。比你曾经还要笨。”

"... I don't get it, Asuka."  
"……我不明白，明日香。"

"Of course you don't. You didn't spend fourteen years missing what seemed to be the only person who could understand you, even a little bit", she said, her voice cracking and tears falling on her face. "You just went to sleep, and I, like the idiot I am, kept hoping things could just go back to the way they were. But they _don't._ They never will. And then you just went away again."  
“你当然不懂。你没花十四年时间去想念那个看似唯一能理解你哪怕一点点的人。”她哽咽着说，泪水滑落在脸颊上。“你只是去睡了一觉，而我，像我这样的傻瓜，却一直希望事情能回到从前那样。但它们回不去了。永远不会。然后你就又消失了。”

Shinji didn't reply for a long while, his head down. The wind shook the leaves around them, and the river kept flowing its course as if nothing had happened.  
真嗣沉默了许久，低着头。风摇动着周围的树叶，河水依旧按照它的轨迹流淌，仿佛什么都没发生过。

Asuka, for a moment, wished to wake up. Then Shinji spoke again.  
那一刻，明日香真希望自己能醒来。随后，真嗣再次开口。

"No. They won't", he said, lifting himself from the rock he sat on and standing on the river. "And I don't think I really want that, Asuka."  
"不，他们不会的。" 他说着，从坐着的岩石上起身，站在河面上。"而且，我也不认为我真的想要那样，明日香。"

He approached her, standing a couple meters away.  
他向她走近，站在几米之外。

"But I'm here. Even if things won't be like they used to, I think that if I'm here, trying, I can build something else. Something better."  
"但我在这里。即使事情无法回到从前，我想，只要我在这里，努力尝试，我就能建立别的东西。更好的东西。"

Asuka lifted her head, rubbing her face. She had to give him credit: making her cry like a little girl? Few people could do that.  
明日香抬起头，揉了揉脸。她不得不承认：能让她哭得像个小女孩？没几个人能做到。

"Oh yeah?", she retorted. "What makes you so sure?"  
“哦，是吗？”她反驳道，“你怎么这么肯定？”

He smiled. A beautiful smile she had never seen on his face, old or young.  
他笑了。一个她从未在他脸上见过的，无论年轻还是年老，都如此美丽的笑容。

"As long as we're here, there's always a chance. Or am I wrong?"  
"只要我们在这里，总有机会。还是我错了？"

She looked down, chuckling as the last of her tears were flushed away. This Shinji, a Shinji she had never met, sounded so sure of himself. Back then, she would give no credit to his words, the words of a brat that swallowed everything around him to his center, be it good or bad.  
她低头轻笑，最后一滴泪水随之消散。这个她从未见过的真嗣，听起来如此自信。那时，她绝不会相信他的话，一个将周围一切好坏都吞噬到内心的小孩的话。

Including her. Damn him. 包括她自己。该死的他。

"No. For some reason, I believe you", she sighed, before looking up and smiling. With the sun behind him, Shinji looked like an angel (a good one) that had come to earth. What a show off. "I kinda miss the wimpy Shinji. He was certainly easier to kick around."  
"不，出于某种原因，我相信你。" 她叹了口气，然后抬头微笑。阳光在他身后，真嗣看起来就像一个降临人间的天使（善良的那种）。真是个爱炫耀的家伙。"我有点想念那个懦弱的真嗣了。他肯定更容易被欺负。"

"Can't help you with that", he chuckled.  
"这我可帮不了你", 他轻声笑道。"

She stood up, standing in front of him. He was now taller than her, something at the same time infuriating and exciting for some reason.  
她站起身，站在他面前。他现在比她高了，不知为何，这既让人恼火又令人兴奋。

"I missed you. No shame in admitting that", she said, sighing.  
"我想你了。承认这一点并不丢人", 她叹息道。

"Well, I missed you too." He smiled. "I'm home", he said, extending his hand towards her.  
"嗯，我也想你了。" 他微笑着说，"我回来了", 他向她伸出手。

She chuckled sadly, grabbing his hand with hers. "Whatever, dream-boy. I'll enjoy this while I can."  
她苦笑着，握住他的手。"随便吧，梦中情人。我会珍惜现在的每一刻。"

Shinji went silent for a moment, raising a brow and tilting his head.  
真嗣沉默了一会儿，扬起眉毛，歪了歪头。

"...dream?" “……梦？”

Asuka, naturally, had very limited experience with holding hands without any type of plugsuit or gloves. It just wasn't something she did.  
明日香自然很少有握手的经验，没有插入栓服或手套的情况下更是如此。这不是她常做的事。

She felt Shinji's big, soft hand on hers for a while, analysing every sensation. She couldn't remember any hands that had felt like his', which was strange. Dreams usually fed on experiences the person had already been through, so the strange sensation she felt when touching this adult version of Shinji she created in her mind was kind of…  
她感受着真嗣那宽大柔软的手掌，细细品味每一丝触感。她记不清有哪双手能像他的这样，这很奇怪。梦境通常基于人们已有的经历，所以当她触摸到这个在心中创造出的成年版真嗣时，那种陌生感有些……

They stared at each other, Asuka's eyes almost bulging out.  
他们彼此凝视，明日香的双眼几乎要瞪出来。

"Well", Mari clicked her tongue and a loud shrieking scream could be heard from the nearby woods, startling Kensuke and Toji, who she had been talking with up until that moment. "I guess he found her."  
“好吧，”玛丽咂了咂舌，随即从附近的树林中传来一声尖锐的尖叫，惊得正在与她交谈的健介和渡志跳了起来。“看来他找到她了。”

[JazzCabbage](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/15695898/JazzCabbage): Every line of dialogue between Asuka and Shinji was golden and perfectly in character. I think you captured perfectly how Shinji character changed over the rebuild movies. I hope you continue this in another oneshot or something just so there can be more. 11/10  
明日香和真嗣之间的每一句对话都精彩绝伦，完美符合角色性格。我认为你准确地捕捉到了真嗣在《新世纪福音战士剧场版：终》系列中的性格变化。希望你能继续以此创作另一篇短篇或其他作品，这样我们就能看到更多精彩内容了。11/10

[YourBlandestNightmare](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/13453602/YourBlandestNightmare): I regret that it took me so long to read this, because I loved it.  
我很遗憾花了这么久才读到这个故事，因为我非常喜欢它。  
  
I really like how you write Asuka's thoughts, they were very entertaining to read. Their conversation felt very natural to me, considering the circumstances. I believe that this is the way they would talk, in this specific situation. And the dialogues were great, especially when she tells him what she hoped would happen.  
我真的很喜欢你笔下明日香的内心独白，读起来非常有趣。考虑到当时的情境，他们的对话对我来说显得非常自然。我相信在这种特定情况下，他们就是这样交谈的。而且对话写得很好，尤其是她告诉他她所希望发生的事情时。  
  
And of course, the ending is perfect :) Great job, and thanks for writing this story.  
当然，结局也很完美 :) 干得漂亮，感谢你创作了这个故事。

[Attila1987](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2081500/Attila1987): "... anyway. This idea I had", she kept explaining, now a bit embarrassed. "We would rescue you, then I would punch you really hard, and then you would fight alongside me and Four-Eyes. There. That's what I wanted to happen."  
"... 总之，这个想法我一直在琢磨"，她继续解释道，现在有点不好意思了。"我们会救你出来，然后我会狠狠揍你一顿，接着你就得跟我还有四眼一起并肩作战。就是这样，这就是我想发生的。"  
  
Is that a reference to the many post-3.0 fics (made before 3.0 1.0 release) that had this premise?  
这是不是在影射那些在 3.0 版本发布前（甚至在 3.0 1.0 发布之前）就以此为前提的众多同人文？

[KingXanaduu](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1162757/KingXanaduu): After all this time, they finally are open to each other, and now the dream has become reality.  
经历了这么长时间，他们终于彼此坦诚相待，梦想如今已成为现实。  
  
This was a great story and a great conclusion to Thrice that I wish we got. We needed more scenes like this, Asuka and Shinji being open and honest with each other, just talking.  
这是一部精彩的故事，也是对《三度》的一个完美收尾，我真希望我们能看到更多这样的情节。我们需要更多像这样的场景，明日香和真嗣能够坦诚相待，只是简单地交谈。  
  
Thank you again for this sweet and honest fic for both Asuka and Shinji. I look forward eagerly for more.  
再次感谢你为明日香和真嗣带来的这部甜蜜而真诚的作品。我热切期待更多。

[skyf0x](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/14765557/skyf0x): That's a cute story, and, as it is always with such oneshots, it does and doesn't need continuation at the same time. Filling the niche of Post-4.0 stories (lack of which is infuriating), it gives everything we want, though it repeats some basic themes and concepts, not adding much to our imagination and knowledge. Despite some minor and more than minor problems there and there, the story is totally capable of satisfying a reader, and that's good.  
这是一个可爱的故事，正如这类短篇小说常有的情况，它既需要又不完全需要续集。填补了 4.0 后故事的空白（这种缺乏令人恼火），它提供了我们想要的一切，尽管它重复了一些基本主题和概念，没有给我们的想象力和知识增添太多新意。尽管存在一些轻微和更严重的问题，这个故事完全能够满足读者，这很好。  
  
The biggest problem is the beginning of this story. It's like retelling of some concepts from the internet, describing some analysis to us straightforwardly. Asuka behaved like that because she felt like that, she felt like that because there was something like that, now she is like that because other things like that, she liked Shinji, she denies she likes Shinji, she accepts she likes Shinji, she misses Shinji. But we already know this. It feels like some attempt in making a reader sure in some ideas or beliefs, if they weren't confirmed enough by the movie. There is certainly not so much so needed subtlety, a lot of things in this building up and preparation us to the main part are too explicit. It feels strange to see such additional confirmation in a story, like a constant mentioning that Asuka has red hair, but maybe some readers are needed in reminding of some things like that (especially if they are not shipping asushin).  
最大的问题在于这个故事的开头。它像是网络概念的复述，直白地向我们阐述某些分析。明日香那样表现是因为她那样感觉，她那样感觉是因为有那样的事情，现在她那样是因为其他那样的事情，她喜欢真嗣，她否认自己喜欢真嗣，她接受自己喜欢真嗣，她想念真嗣。但我们已经知道这些了。这感觉像是在试图让读者确信某些观点或信念，如果电影本身还未充分证实的话。显然，这里并不需要那么多微妙之处，许多构建和准备进入高潮的部分过于直白。看到故事中不断重复确认明日香的红发，感觉很奇怪，但或许有些读者需要这样的提醒（尤其是那些不支持明日香和真嗣配对的读者）。  
  
Smooth transition to the "dream" was really cool. At first it felt like it's probably a dream for Asuka, and I loved how it's possible to be fooled like that a little and smoothly to start understanding that it's not a dream at all. The best is definitely the conversation between Asuka and Shinji. It's so sincere that I was reading every line with great anticipation and trembling. I just wanted to finally see adult Shinji and Asuka, and you delivered this feeling very well. It could be hard to describe this new Shinji, but it worked. I can't really say the same for Asuka during the talk, since it's very hard to see Shiki who giggles and cries. But she thought it is a dream, so she though she could be more open, right?  
平滑过渡到“梦境”真的很酷。起初感觉这可能只是明日香的梦，我喜欢这种稍稍被迷惑然后逐渐意识到这并非梦境的顺畅转变。最精彩的部分无疑是明日香和真嗣之间的对话。那份真诚让我每读一行都充满期待和颤抖。我只想最终看到成年的真嗣和明日香，而你很好地传达了这种感觉。描述这个新真嗣可能很难，但效果很好。对于对话中的明日香，我则难以完全认同，因为很难看到一个会咯咯笑和哭泣的式。但她以为这是梦，所以她认为自己可以更开放，对吧？  
  
So it's only awesome when the realisation fell on Asuka's shoulders and everything became concluded with such funny ending. Emotions were changed from one spectre to another, but they were always kept high. Now everyone is here, with a strong wish to build something better. Together.  
所以，当真相落在明日香肩上，一切以如此有趣的结局收场时，才显得格外精彩。情感从一种光谱转变到另一种，但始终保持高涨。现在，每个人都怀着强烈的愿望，想要共同建造更好的未来。  
  
And yes, copium jokes became too old and annoying a long ago. You're not 14 years old and it's not even a real coping. That's embarrassing even for me...  
没错，那些关于逃避现实的笑话早已过时且令人厌烦。你不再是 14 岁的孩子，那甚至不是真正的应对方式。连我都觉得这很尴尬...

[B123](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3758358/B123): This was such a great fic to read, so thank you for this Luanfrag.  
这篇同人作品读起来真是太棒了，非常感谢 Luanfrag 的创作。  
  
After the final movie I do eventually scour the Eva fanfiction sites for material like this to wash away the bittersweet ending that Anno forced down are throats.  
在最后一部电影之后，我最终会在 EVA 同人小说网站上寻找这样的素材，以洗去庵野秀明强加给我们的那苦乐参半的结局。  
  
Asuka thoughts are spot on to her character and how she would pretty much be and feel after the events of 3.00.1, especially regarding Shinji. Also I’m glad that this ended on a happy and funny note as I expected this to be a melancholy type of ending. But I’m glad I was proven wrong.  
明日香的想法完全符合她的性格，以及她在 3.00.1 事件后对真嗣的感觉，尤其是关于真嗣的部分。我很高兴这个故事以一个快乐而幽默的结局收尾，我原本以为会是一个忧郁的结局。但很高兴我错了。  
  
It’s a shame that this is only a one-shot fic as I and many others would have loved to see this continue and explore the relationship between Asuka and Shinji post 3.00.1 with Shinji and Mari trying to reacquaint themselves to the third Village plus explore where they’ve been and how they returned.  
遗憾的是，这只是一篇短篇小说，我和许多人都希望能看到这个故事继续下去，探索 3.00.1 之后明日香和真嗣的关系，以及真嗣和玛丽如何重新适应第三个村庄，并探索他们去了哪里以及如何回来的。  
  
So yeah again shame this is only a one-shot but none the less this was a great piece of Eva fiction. Hope to see more stuff from you in the near future Luanfrag.  
所以，再次感到遗憾这只是一篇短篇，但无论如何，这是一部很棒的 EVA 同人作品。希望不久的将来能再次看到你的作品，Luanfrag。

[NoseGum](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/14961104/NoseGum): NNGHHH I'M COPING BEYOND BELIEF RN I CANT HOLD ON MUCH LONGER OH NOOOOOOO  
呃啊啊啊我现在应对得超乎想象我快撑不住了哦不啊啊啊啊  
kewt

[Romulo Nidoking BR](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/109777/Romulo-Nidoking-BR): Bravo! 太棒了！  
  
Another great post Thrice fic from you, this time in the old Eva world.  
又是一篇精彩绝伦的 Thrice 同人文，这次带你回到旧版 Eva 的世界。  
  
The twist at the ending was obvious from the start, but you kept the tension going all the way that I started to have doubts and finished with a nicely done ending, turning a very emotional and bittersweet conversation into old classic Asushin comedy from the action arc of the original series :)  
结局的转折从一开始就显而易见，但你一直保持着紧张感，以至于我开始产生怀疑，并以一个精心设计的结尾收场，将一段情感丰富且略带苦涩的对话转变为原系列动作篇章中的经典 Asushin 喜剧 :)  
  
Thanks for writing it.  
感谢你的创作。

[MooseTracks101](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/15131552/MooseTracks101): Man, that was nice. It was simple, it was sweet, it was perfect. It might be cope to the max, but I don’t care.  
伙计，那真是太棒了。简单、甜蜜、完美。虽然可能是自我安慰到了极点，但我不在乎。  
Good stuff :)
