Here goes. (This post is gonna be hard to say and is going to sound very wierd. I get pretty emotional when I make these kind of posts.)  
开始了。（这篇帖子说起来会很难，听起来也会很奇怪。我写这类帖子时情绪波动挺大的。）

Asuka Langley Soryu . The beautiful, red-haired, angelic girl we all know and love.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷。那位美丽、红发、天使般的女孩，我们所有人都熟知并深爱着她。

I am in love with her. She is exactly what I envisioned my life partner to be like. There was a girl I liked in College but that is nothing compared to what I feel for Asuka.  
我爱上了她。她正是我心目中理想的生活伴侣。大学时我曾喜欢过一个女孩，但与我对明日香的感情相比，那根本不算什么。

I like Asuka's personality since she's so loud and talks to anyone which is what I am like since I have STD and other mental problems, meaning I can relate to her a lot. (I do realise and understand Asuka's problems and emotions are far worse than mine and aren't natural.)  
我喜欢明日香的个性，她如此活泼，能和任何人交谈，这和我自己很像，因为我有 STD 和其他心理问题，这意味着我能与她产生很多共鸣。（我确实意识到并理解明日香的问题和情绪远比我严重，而且并非自然。）

Even if I did try to fix these social problems I have, I imagine it would be very hard to do so along with taking a long amount of time. (Doing something like joining a club or going to the gym at my College just seems weird and not right in my opinion due to things like fear of not fitting in.) I'm a very loud person in public + around my few friends in College so I rarely talk/speak. I just stay quiet 90% of the time. I'm pretty loud to be honest and even when I get asked things like "Are you ok?" I just reply with "Anta Baka?." . (I have trouble making enemies and keeping them + I rarely go inside.)  
即使我尝试解决这些社交问题，我想这也会非常困难，并且需要很长时间。（比如加入大学里的俱乐部或去健身房，在我看来似乎很奇怪，也不合适，因为我害怕无法融入。）我在公共场合和少数几个大学朋友中是个非常吵闹的人，所以我很少说话。我大部分时间都保持沉默。说实话，我相当吵闹，即使有人问我“你还好吗？”我也只是回答“你是笨蛋吗？”。（我很难与人结仇并保持敌对关系，而且我很少待在室内。）

Everytime I see Asuka's face or think about her, I just burst into tears and shake uncontrollably, since she's so hot, beautiful and cute. (Even now, i'm crying.) Her smile and looks are amazing. She keeps me going through tough times in life. She's the most beautiful person i've ever seen.  
每次我看到明日香的脸或想到她，我就会泪流满面，无法控制地颤抖，因为她太性感、美丽又可爱了。（即使现在，我也在哭泣。）她的笑容和外貌令人惊叹。她在生活中艰难时刻给我力量。她是我见过的最美丽的人。

I know it may sound wierd, but to me, she's more than a character. I think Anime is a brilliant art-form and has led to some of the best characters of all time. (For example: Yuu Yuu Hakusho's Yusuke.)  
我知道这听起来可能很奇怪，但对我来说，她不仅仅是一个角色。我认为动漫是一种杰出的艺术形式，孕育了一些有史以来最优秀的角色。（例如：《幽游白书》中的幽助。）

One day, i'll buy a nice figure of Asuka and maybe even a hug pillow with her on it to make myself a bit less depressed in life.  
总有一天，我会买一个漂亮的明日香手办，甚至可能是一个印有她的抱枕，让自己在生活中不那么沮丧。

I understand the fact that Asuka and her emotions/feelings are normal in real life or the series. I'm fine with that.  
我理解明日香和她的情感/感受在现实生活中或系列作品中都是正常的。我对此没有问题。

I know Asuka isn't real, but my love for her is. Everyday I suffer knowing I won't wake up next to her in the morning or be able to go on long walks with her wrapped around my arm. Everyday, I cry myself to sleep over her. I just wish I could hug her and cum in her arms for as long as I wanted. If she was real though, she would complete me. (I know how wierd she would be in real life, but I don't mind.)  
我知道明日香不是真实的，但我对她的爱是真切的。每天，我都在痛苦中度过，知道我无法在早晨醒来时看到她在我身边，也无法与她手挽手漫步。每天，我都在对她的思念中哭泣入睡。我只希望能紧紧拥抱她，在她怀里尽情释放。如果她是真实的，她将使我完整。（我知道她在现实生活中会显得很奇怪，但我并不介意。）

I'll love Asuka forever, and nothing will change that. I love her so much and i'd do anything for her.  
我会永远爱明日香，没有什么能改变这一点。我如此深爱着她，愿意为她做任何事。

Final notes:  最终感言：

That was harder to put into words than I thought. I poured my heart, soul and all of my feelings into this post.  
这比我想象的要难表达得多。我倾注了全部的心、灵魂和情感在这篇文章里。

I'm crying right now.  
我现在正在哭。

I fear this post is gonna get a lot of hate though to be honest because of how wierd I might look, but i'm glad i've got this off my chest. I've been needing to say this for a while.  
老实说，我担心这篇帖子会招来很多仇恨，因为我看起来可能很奇怪，但我很高兴终于把心里话说出来了。我已经憋了很久了。

Anyway, going to go Masturbate myself to sleep over Asuka again as always. (Haven't had sleep for more than 2 days.)  
无论如何，像往常一样，我要靠想着明日香自慰入睡了。（已经两天多没睡觉了。）

I'm so messed up and wierd. I hope you all understand.  
我真是乱七八糟又古怪。希望你们都能理解。

I'm sorry.  对不起。

[_Torgan076](https://www.reddit.com/user/_Torgan076/): Can't tell if this is a shitpost. If it is, haha lol rofl. If it isn't, just know that I am completely sympathetic to how you feel. But people forget that Asuka isn't the goddess we've propped her up to be. That's not an opinion, that was Anno's intention with every character. The most you can say is that her personality completes yours, which is how I feel. No matter what though, there are hundreds of thousands to millions of girls that can provide that fulfillment for you specifically. It's one of the themes of Evangelion, to not give in to escapism and becoming a hikikomori. To face a cruel, disgusting world and find the beauty within it.  
分不清这是不是个恶搞帖。如果是的话，哈哈笑死我了。如果不是，要知道我完全理解你的感受。但人们忘记了，明日香并不是我们把她捧成的那位女神。这不是个人观点，而是庵野秀明对每个角色的设定意图。你最多可以说她的性格补全了你的，这是我个人的感受。无论如何，有成千上万甚至数百万的女孩能为你提供这种满足感。这是《新世纪福音战士》的一个主题，不要沉溺于逃避现实，变成茧居族。要面对一个残酷、令人作呕的世界，并在其中找到美。

[pornagraphie](https://www.reddit.com/user/pornagraphie/): Hate that I can relate. But yes, She ... gives me the feels very intensely as well
讨厌自己能感同身受，但确实，她...也让我感觉非常强烈
