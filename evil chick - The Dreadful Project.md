### Chapter 1: The Assignment
Okay this is an idea that came to mind when I saw an episode of Saved by the Bell. I thought it would be funny if I used the Evangelion characters in this so I hope you like it. I also don't own Evangelion; it belongs, only to Gainax. This is supposed to be funny but I might go angsty by accident. I have a tendency to do that.  
这个点子是在我观看《救命下课铃》某一集时萌生的。我觉得将《新世纪福音战士》的角色融入其中会颇具趣味，希望你能喜欢。我并不拥有《新世纪福音战士》的版权，它只属于 Gainax。初衷是想制造笑点，但或许会不经意间流露出一些沉重感，我有时会这样。

The classroom was loud with conversations of all the worried students. Everyone was discussing what their mid-term project was and they were hoping it would be easy. Shinji sat in his desk along with his friends who were preoccupied with the problem, though Shinji didn't really seem to care. He was too busy looking at Rei, wondering about her. She was too quiet, in the years she had been in school, she never made any friends at all. He remembered how fast Asuka made a lot of friends in the first day of school and Asuka didn't exactly have the best personality. It really surprised him but then again, Asuka always surprised him. Toji leaned against Shinji's desk and stared at Kensuke who was fiddling with his model of a plane.  
教室里回荡着焦虑学生们的交谈声。大家都在议论各自的期中项目，盼望它别太难。真嗣坐在自己的位子上，周围的朋友们正为这个问题烦恼，而他却显得漠不关心。他的注意力全在绫波身上，对她充满好奇。绫波过于沉默，在校这些年，她竟未结交任何朋友。他想起明日香开学第一天就结交了许多朋友，尽管她的性格并不讨喜。这着实让他惊讶，毕竟明日香总能出人意料。东治倚在真嗣的桌旁，目光落在正摆弄飞机模型的健介身上。

"I wonder what our project is gonna be about," said Kensuke still entranced with the detail on the model. Toji smiled slyly as he quickly looked at Shinji.  
"我在想我们的项目会涉及什么，"健介说着，目光仍被模型上的细节深深吸引。 托吉狡猾地一笑，迅速瞥了真嗣一眼。

"I hope we can pick our partners!" screamed Toji happily.  
"真希望我们能自己挑选搭档啊！" Toji 兴奋地喊道。

"Oh do you want to be my partner?" asked Kensuke as he managed to look away from his toy. Toji stared at him and grinned.  
"哦，你想做我的搭档吗？" 健介说着，终于将视线从玩具上移开。彻看着他，露出了笑容。

"Of course not! Ikari will be my partner!" he said and noticed that his friend looked hurt because of the glare he was giving to him. "Geez, you aren't much of a smart friend, so don't look surprised."  
当然不是！碇将是我的搭档！"他说着，察觉到朋友因他的怒视而感到受伤。"哎，你这朋友也太不机灵了，别那么惊讶。

"True", he mumbled to himself. Shinji stopped looking at Rei to see Toji and Kensuke were staring at him with smiles on their faces.  
"真的", 他低声自语。真嗣不再看绫波，而是注意到东治和健介正带着笑容注视着他。

"Well, someone looks love struck," Shinji blushed and turned away from his friends, realizing this would take a long time to stop the argument.  
"瞧，有人似乎陷入了爱河，" 真嗣脸颊泛红，转身避开朋友们的目光，意识到这场争执恐怕一时半会儿难以结束。

"I am not in love!" He denied helplessly, "I don't like her in that way!" Suddenly he noticed she was glancing at him fighting with his friends and he blushed more. Asuka turned to see what was happening and started to laugh.  
"我没有恋爱！" 他无奈地否认，"我对她并没有那种感情！" 忽然，他察觉到她正注视着他和朋友们争执，脸颊愈发绯红。明日香回头一看，忍不住笑出声来。

"Look! Shin-chan is blushing all the way to his ears!" the red head vixen pointed at him snickering maniacally with her friends. "What a loser!" Hikari saw the teacher walking down the long hall and immediately screamed as he entered through the threshold of the classroom.  
"瞧！小新脸红得连耳朵都红了！"那个红头发的调皮女孩指着他，和朋友们一起坏笑。"真是个小可怜！"光一看到老师沿着长廊走来，刚踏进教室就立刻尖叫起来。

"Everyone stand! You may now sit," the whole class settled down quietly, ready to know what the project was. The teacher sat down and started the roll call. Everyone was nervously waiting for the sensei to announce the project but it seemed he was taking his time.  
"全体起立！现在请坐，"全班同学安静地坐定，满怀期待地等待着了解项目详情。老师坐下后开始点名。大家都在紧张地等待老师宣布项目，而他似乎并不着急。

Finally he finished and took out a paper with everyone's names. "Okay, this year's project will have to do with parenthood." The whole class gasped. "You are Japan's future so we want to teach you about both marriage and how to be a good parent. I will assign you your partner right now" he started to name off names. "Hikari and Kensuke," Hikari screamed when she looked at her partner. "Toji and Rei," Toji just smiled and looked at Rei.  
他终于完成任务，取出一张列有全班同学姓名的纸张。"今年我们的课题是关于育儿。"此言一出，全班哗然。"你们代表着日本的未来，因此我们要教授你们婚姻之道及如何成为称职的父母。现在，我将宣布你们的搭档。"他开始逐一念出名字。"光和健介，"光一看到自己的搭档便惊叫起来。"透和零，"透则微笑着望向零。

"Well that isn't so bad," he whispered to Shinji. Shinji began to feel worried about who he was partnered with but he felt let down he couldn't be with Rei. Though, maybe it was good or else it'd be very awkward.  
"其实这也没那么糟，" 他轻声对真嗣说。真嗣开始对自己的搭档感到忧虑，同时为不能与零搭档而感到失落。但转念一想，或许这样反而是好事，否则场面可能会相当尴尬。

"Shinji and.."there was a long silence, only the sound of Asuka making fun of Hikari was heard, "Asuka." Asuka slowly turned back to the teacher.  
真嗣和...一阵漫长的沉默，唯有明日香取笑光的声响，'明日香。'明日香这才慢慢转回身面向老师。

"What, Sensei? Did you just say that I will have to marry Shinji Ikari?" the teacher nodded and kept on reading the other names. "What! I don't want to marry Shinji, he's such a loser!" She immediately started to pout and Hikari pet her head.  
"什么，老师？您刚才是说我得嫁给碇真嗣吗？"老师点了点头，继续念着其他名字。"什么！我不想嫁给碇真嗣，他太没出息了！"她立刻撅起了嘴，而明日香则抚摸着她的头。

"Shinji isn't so bad, he's actually kind of cute compared to. Kensuke," said Hikari as she kept on petting Asuka's head. "You still like Shinji, don't you?" she whispered.  
"真嗣其实挺不错的，跟 Kensuke 比起来，他还有点可爱呢。" Hikari 一边说着，一边继续抚摸着 Asuka 的头，"你心里还是喜欢真嗣的，对吧？" 她低声细语。

"Yes, but I don't want to be his WIFE!" screamed the German girl as she stabbed her eraser with her pencil, angrily. Her best friend backed away, scared, "I hate this!"  
是的，但我绝不想成为他的妻子！"德国女孩尖叫道，气愤地用铅笔猛戳橡皮。她最好的朋友惊恐地退后，"我真受不了这个！

Shinji threw his head against his desk, "Why her? I'm gonna end up having my head bitten off more than usual. This is living hell, as if living in the same house with her isn't bad enough, she has to be my wife!" Toji intently looked at Rei and smiled, finding himself lightly blushing.  
真嗣猛地把头撞在桌上，"怎么偏偏是她？我肯定会被骂得更凶。这简直是活地狱，和她同住一屋已经够受的了，她居然还成了我的妻子！" 东治专注地凝视着绫波，嘴角露出一丝微笑，不觉间脸颊泛起了红晕。

"Well Rei would make a good wife," he said dreamily. Shinji raised his head trying to make sure he didn't just hear what he thought he heard. Kensuke yawned.  
"丽确实适合做贤妻，"他陶醉地说。真嗣抬头确认自己是否听错。剑介在一旁打了个哈欠。

"Nah, this isn't so hard. Hikari's probably gonna take over, which means I don't have to do much work" he laughed, "I think I'm actually lucky today." Shinji glared at Kensuke.  
"其实这也不难。光应该会接手，那我就不用怎么忙活了。"他笑着说，"看来我今天运气不错。" 真嗣不满地瞥了健介一眼。

"Tomorrow I will marry everyone, so it'll be official." He smiled, "I expect the best from all of you, okay." All of the teenagers groaned wishing that the day would just end.  
"明天我将和所有人举行婚礼，这样就正式了。"他微笑着说，"我对你们都寄予厚望，大家要加油哦。"所有的青少年都发出哀叹，盼着这一天快点过去。

* * *

Shinji sat in his bed thinking about how difficult the project was going to be with Asuka as his wife. It was also pretty awkward because for some reason he felt some sort of tension around her, he kind of liked her. She obviously didn't like him so he knew he was going to get hit more than usual. "Oh god, I'm so screwed", he mumbled to himself as he threw himself onto the bed. Why did everyone else have good partners except him? Maybe he could convince the teacher to separate them? Nah, Asuka has probably already tried. He let out a sigh and suddenly someone slammed the door open, causing Shinji to jump.  
真嗣坐在床上，思索着与明日香作为妻子共同完成项目将会多么困难。气氛也颇为尴尬，不知为何，他感到一种紧张感围绕着她，他似乎有点喜欢她。显然她并不喜欢他，他知道自己将会比平时更频繁地受到打击。“天啊，我真是完蛋了，”他自言自语，一头栽倒在床上。为什么别人都有好搭档，唯独他没有？或许他能说服老师将他们分开？不，明日香可能已经试过了。他叹了口气，突然有人砰地一声推开门，吓得真嗣一跳。

It was Asuka with an angry look on her face holding a rolled up newspaper in her hands. "I'm gonna show you how a wife really is Shinji!" she screamed as ran towards him, ready to hit him. Shinji backed away from her, finding that he was cornered. "Kensuke told me what you saying about me!" The scared boy closed his eyes, expecting to get horribly beaten up. Stupid Kensuke!  
明日香面带怒容，手里紧握着一份卷起的报纸。“真嗣，我要让你知道一个妻子真正的样子！”她尖叫着冲向他，准备挥打。真嗣步步后退，却发现自己已无路可逃。“剑介告诉我你背后说我坏话！”恐惧中的男孩紧闭双眼，以为即将遭受一顿毒打。可恶的剑介！

Bwahahahaha! I have finally managed to find time to write the second chapter for this fic and I am so sorry that I've taken so long! bows thanks for all the reviews, I hope this chapter is good enough and long enough. Oh yeah, well the reason this is rated PG-13 is the mild language and adult situations. see it's not so bad!  
哈哈哈！我总算挤出时间完成了这篇同人文的第二章，让大家久等了，实在抱歉！深深感谢大家的每一条评论，希望这一章能让大家满意，内容丰富。顺便提一下，本章之所以被定为 PG-13，是因为包含了一些轻微的粗口和成人内容。其实，整体来看并不算太过分！

Asuka ran towards Shinji who was already in the fetal position in hope that somehow he would be spared. He cringed, closing his eyes expecting the fatal blow but nothing happened. Not knowing what to do Shinji curiously lifted his head to see Asuka backing away with a look of distain on her face. She dropped the newspaper and placed her hand over her forehead, "Sorry Shinji. I shouldn't have tried to hit you," she paused, looking to the side. "I guess we need to get along for the grade. We both can't use an F with our already horrible averages" Shin-chan couldn't help smiling at her but she didn't exactly know what he meant and assumed he was being his typical smart ass self. "You know Ikari-kun, you really suck"  
明日香奔向已蜷缩成一团的真嗣，盼望他能逃过一劫。他紧闭双眼，等待着致命一击，然而什么也没发生。真嗣困惑地抬起头，只见明日香正带着一脸嫌弃地后退。她丢下报纸，手扶额头，“抱歉，真嗣，我不该想打你，”她顿了顿，眼神飘向一旁。“看来我们得为了成绩和睦相处。我们俩的平均分已经够糟了，不能再添个 F。”真嗣忍不住对她微笑，但她并未领会其意，只当他又在耍嘴皮子。“碇君，你真是让人失望。”

"But I didn't do anything," he said helplessly clinging on to his bed sheet, worried that his luck would be quickly taken away. Asuka suddenly gave him the most evil glare he had ever seen and it paralyzed him. She quickly turned away from him in a huff and slammed the door to his room. What was wrong with this girl? It seems like he would never be able to figure her out. Once he was left alone in his little neat room, he pulled out his SDAT to possibly think to himself since he had no homework. A thought suddenly hit him... he was going to marry Asuka. Alone he giggled, placing his forefinger on his mouth and his face turned a light red. He paused yet again and his eyes widened HE WAS GOING TO MARRY ASUKA! Oh man, he was so gonna die yet somehow he already knew this.  
"但他什么也没做，"他无助地紧抓床单，忧心自己的好运即将溜走。明日香突然投来他前所未见的恶毒眼神，令他僵在原地。她气冲冲地转身，砰地关上他房间的门。这女孩到底怎么了？他似乎永远也摸不透她。独自留在整洁的房间里，他拿出 SDAT，因为没有作业，便想独自思考一番。一个念头突然袭来...他要和明日香结婚了。他独自窃笑，食指轻触嘴唇，脸颊泛起微红。他再次愣住，眼睛瞪大，他真的要和明日香结婚了！哦，天哪，他觉得自己快要死了，但不知为何，他早已心知肚明。

Shinji groaned and let out a well needed sigh. These days were going to get worse and worse with each new assignment He quickly grasped at the headphones and placed them in his ears, maybe listening to music might make him forget for a while rather than to remember.  
真嗣呻吟一声，深深地叹了口气。随着新任务接踵而至，日子只会愈发艰难。他急忙戴上耳机，或许音乐能让他暂时忘却烦恼，不去回想那些不愉快。

There was a loud crash heard throughout the apartment as Asuka slammed her door to her room in an effort to shut herself off from the world. She stomped and let out a scream that was so piercing that Shinji could hear it clearly with his music blasting in his ears. The teenage boy shook in his bed and swore that he wouldn't want to come out of his room that whole day.  
明日香猛地关上房门，试图与外界隔绝，一声巨响在公寓中回荡。她跺脚尖叫，那尖锐的声音穿透了真嗣耳边轰鸣的音乐。少年在床上颤抖，决意那天绝不出房门半步。

"Damnit that baka really gets to me," Asuka mumbled to herself as she grasped at the telephone that layed in a pile of clothes. Her grip tightened on the black cell phone as her heart began to pound so hard that she swore it would tear out of her ribcage. Helplessly she tried to do the typical breathe in breathe out method but she found herself hyperventilating. Her door suddenly opened and there was Misato panting just as badly as Asuka but the horrible thing was that she taking a shower at the moment.  
"那个笨蛋真让人火大，" 明日香低声自语，伸手从衣服堆里抓起电话。她紧握着黑色手机，心跳得如此猛烈，仿佛要冲破胸膛。她试图用深呼吸来平复情绪，却发现自己开始喘不过气来。就在这时，她的房门突然被打开，只见同样喘着粗气的葛城美里站在门口，而她当时竟然还在洗澡。

"What's wrong Asuka! I heard a lot of screaming and slamming, I thought maybe you had finally killed Shinji!" The girl standing before Misato just stared at her feeling quite thankful that some of the towel was covering her but much to her demise Shinji slowly opened his door to see what had happened.  
"怎么了，明日香！我听到一阵尖叫和撞击声，还以为你终于对真治下手了呢！"站在美里面前的女孩只是盯着她，庆幸有毛巾遮挡，但不幸的是，真治缓缓打开房门，探头查看情况。

Misato raised her hand happily, "Hey Shin-chan" The towel dropped to the floor therefore causing Shinji's eyes to widen and Asuka to let out a scream. Shinji couldn't help overlooking the well endowed Misato but he turned feeling quite humiliated that he had actually looked. "Opps," Misato mumbled and picked up the towel. "I'm sorry you guys, I guess I'll leave then." The older women left the room leaving the two teenagers alone in the room basking in the awkward silence.  
美里高兴地举起手，喊道：“嘿，真嗣！”不料毛巾掉落在地，令真嗣瞪大了眼睛，明日香则尖叫出声。真嗣虽不自觉地瞥了一眼身材丰满的美里，但随即转过头，感到一阵羞愧。“哎呀，”美里轻声嘀咕，拾起毛巾，“抱歉了，我还是先走吧。”年长的她离开后，房间里只剩下两位青少年，沉浸在尴尬的静默中。

"You stupid pervert I saw you looking at her" Asuka almost immediately screamed, clearly breaking the silence.  
"你这蠢货，还敢偷看她！" 飞鸟立刻尖叫，打破了原本的宁静。

"I'm sorry," Shinji said in self defense, dreading the fact that he came out of his room but honestly, much to his disgust was glad that he saw Misato naked. He shivered at the thought though but he didn't have much time to think since a very very angry Asuka was walking towards him. He just backed away and both felt and heard the thump of his back hitting the wall. Suddenly Asuka held herself back again despite how much he deserved a kick in the crotch but she had to stop. Though what hurt her the most was the way he stared at Misato, she closed her eyes and realized something...she was jealous.  
"抱歉，" 真嗣自卫地说，虽然他害怕走出房间，但内心深处，他对自己看到美里裸体感到厌恶的同时，也有些庆幸。他一想到这个就打了个寒颤，但没时间多想，因为怒气冲冲的明日香正向他逼近。他只能后退，直到背部撞到墙上。突然，尽管真嗣理应受到一脚，明日香还是控制住了自己。然而，最让她心痛的是他看美里的眼神，她闭上眼睛，意识到自己...嫉妒了。

There was an appetizing smell that filled the residence and it was the only sign that Hikari was cooking for her family. She stood in front of the countertop chopping up some onions crying for more than one reason. "Of all people, why Kensuke," the cook mumbled under her breath trying to hold back her tears. "Why couldn't it be Toji," she whimpered. Hikari knew she was going to have to do all of the work but then again that wasn't so bad, it was just having to always be with the crazy otaku throughout the school day. It was too much for the girl so she decided to try to avoid her future husband and get the one she wanted.  
家中弥漫着诱人的香气，这是唯一暗示光正在为家人烹饪的迹象。她站在厨房台前切着洋葱，泪水因多重原因而流淌。“为什么非得是健介，”她低声嘟囔，努力忍住泪水。“为什么不是冬二呢，”她抽泣着。光明白自己将不得不承担所有家务，但这还不算太糟，只是不得不整天和那个疯狂的宅男一起在学校度过。这对她来说实在难以承受，因此她决定避开未来的丈夫，争取自己真正喜欢的人。

---

Shinji was yet again staring at his ceiling for some unknown reason but sleep was easily overcoming his already tired body. Tomorrow was the day...the day he was actually beginning to dread with each passing second. Getting married was a big thing but it shouldn't be when it wasn't even real, yet somehow it did feel real, a little too real for Shinji's own liking.  
真嗣再次无故盯着天花板，睡意迅速袭来，让他疲惫的身体难以抗拒。明天就是那个日子……随着时间每分每秒的流逝，他开始对那一天感到越来越恐惧。结婚虽是人生大事，但当这场婚姻并非出于真心时，本不应有如此沉重的压力，然而对真嗣而言，这种感觉却异常真实，真实得让他难以承受。

Asuka was also on her bed thinking about the whole marriage thing going over the same bad things but not everything was bad. A smile appeared on the vixen's face, "I'm going to be Ms. Ikari," she whispered turning a light red.  
明日香同样躺在床上，思索着婚姻的种种，虽然有些不如意，但也不尽是坏事。她脸上露出一抹狡黠的微笑，轻声自语：“我就要成为碇太太了。”说着，脸上不禁泛起红晕。

Shinji lifted his head from the comfort of his pillows. He had spent quite a while just thinking of the thingswere about to happen the next day. A sigh escaped his lips once the music ended in his SDAT. The wholenight he had slept on and off and he didn't really feel at rest. There was noise in the living room which meantit was probably morning. He was usually the one to get up first but obviously someone had beaten him to it. 
真嗣从舒适的枕头中抬起头，沉思着次日即将到来的事情，时间悄然流逝。当他的 SDAT 音乐戛然而止，他不禁叹了口气。这一夜他睡得断断续续，并未感到真正的休息。客厅传来的声响预示着清晨的到来。他通常是家中最早起的，但今天显然有人捷足先登。

Lazily Shinji got off of the bed and slowly slid his door open. Asuka's blue eyes stared back at him with aspoon in her mouth pouring milk into a bowl of cereal. 
真嗣懒散地从床上起身，缓缓拉开房门。明日香蓝色的眼睛正凝视着他，嘴里含着勺子，正往一碗麦片中倒牛奶。

"Why are you awake so early," murmured Shinji scratching his bed head with only one eye open. 
“你怎么这么早就醒了？”真嗣一边挠着凌乱的头发，一边半睁着一只眼，含糊地问道。

"Well why are you awake so late," she retorted once she pulled the spoon out of her mouth and put in itsrightful place, in the bowl. "I had to make my own breakfast for once because you had to be so lazy." Shinji'seyeswidened. 
 "哎，你怎么这么晚还不睡？" 她一边说着，一边从嘴里抽出勺子放回碗中，"我得自己弄早餐，谁让你这么懒。" 真嗣惊讶地睁大了眼睛。

"That's odd," he managed to say but Asuka went on complaining. 


"I mean, how could you just think about yourself? I have wants and needs too, Shinji!" She placed her handon her chest but noticed Shinji was instead pondering his bad timing. Suddenly Misato came out of her roompractically dragging herself out typically yawning and scratching her stomach. She smiled at both of the kidsalmost drunk like. "Ha you two are getting married today aren't you," 
"真奇怪，" 他勉强回应，而明日香继续抱怨，"你怎么只想着自己？我也有我的需求和愿望，真嗣！" 她把手放在胸前，却发现真嗣正为自己的不合时宜而苦恼。这时，美里从房间里拖着身子出来，打着哈欠，挠着肚子。她醉意朦胧地对两个孩子微笑，"哈，你们俩今天不是要结婚吗？" 

she let out a small giggle seeing both teenagers turn a darkred, "Seems like you're perfect. Too bad you are too young to get married yet." She placed her hands on Shinji'scheeks and pinched them while laughing harder. "Boy is he a great catch Asuka! A real man!"
她轻笑一声，看到两个青少年脸红得厉害，"看来你们真是天生一对。 可惜你还太小，还不能结婚。"她笑着把手放在真嗣的脸颊上，轻轻捏了捏。"这小子真是个好对象，明日香！真是个男子汉！" 

"I guess," Asuka said feeling her cheeks return to their former color. Shinji's eyes followed Asuka as she wentto the kitchen to eat. Misato still clad with a smile hugged the depressed teenager. "Don't worry, you are a great catch Shin-chan," she said with a reassuring tone of voice. "I guess," he muttered.  
"可能吧，"明日香说着，感觉自己的脸颊恢复了血色。真嗣的目光跟随着明日香，看着她走向厨房。Misato 依旧带着微笑，拥抱了情绪低落的少年。"别担心，你是个好对象，真嗣，"她用安慰的语气说道。"可能吧，"他低声回应。

---
There Shinji was sitting in the same seat sitting next to the same people and staring at Rei looking outside.But something was different, he took in some air and turned to Asuka who was chit chatting with Hikari. It wasonly an assignment, it wasn't like they were really gonna get married, thought Shinji. Toji nudged Shinji with asmile clad on his face.  
真嗣坐在老位置，旁边依旧是那些人，目光停留在望向窗外的绫波身上。然而，气氛似乎有所变化。他深吸一口气，转头看向正与光闲聊的明日香。这不过是项任务，并非真要结婚，真嗣暗自思忖。东治面带微笑，用胳膊肘轻碰了他一下。

"Hey its our lucky day, or at least mine," he smirked as Shinji grimaced. "Why so gloomy, is it cause you'remarrying the devil incarnate?"  
嘿，看来今天我挺走运的，"他得意地笑着，而真嗣却一脸苦相。"干嘛这么愁眉苦脸的，难道是因为你要娶那个恶魔转世？

"She's not so bad, right," Shinji stared at Toji with huge eyes, creeping him out a little. He backed away fromShinji.  
"她其实也没那么差，你说呢？" 真嗣瞪大眼睛凝视着东治，让他感到一丝不安。他不由自主地后退，与真嗣保持距离。

"Dude, this is Asuka we're talkin about," Kensuke came out from behind Toji nodding, "She's pure evil"  
兄弟，我们谈论的可是明日香，" 健介从东治背后走出来，点头强调，"她绝对是个小恶魔

"Yeah that girl can be a little scary," said Kensuke, "I'm glad I got Hikari, imagine being stuck with Asuka!"  
确实，那女孩有时挺让人害怕的，" 健介说道，"幸好我有了光，要是和明日香搭档，真不敢想象。

"Ha!" both of Shinji's buddies said in unison.  
"哈！" 新二的两位朋友同时说道。

Shinji leaned against his arm still staring at Asuka, "Why do you think she hates me so much?"  
真嗣倚着手臂，目光未离明日香，"你怎么觉得她对我这么反感？"

"Huh!" they both screamed.  
"哎呀！"两人异口同声地惊呼。

"She treats me so badly for no reason," he then lowered his arm down and placed his head on it deep inthought. "I don't act mean or anything but she still is…"  
她无缘无故地对我这么刻薄，"他随后垂下手，将头枕在手臂上，陷入深思。"我并未表现出任何不友好，她却依旧这样……

"Asuka," Toji completed Shinji's sentence even though it wasn't exactly what he was going to say. "It's theway she is with everyone, now stop thinking about it so much."  
Asuka 就是这样，" Toji 接过 Shinji 的话，虽然并非原意。"她对谁都这样，别太往心里去。

"Yeah stop it Shinji, you're bringing us down. This is a great day, as of today we will be married men!"Kensuke said triumphantly with standing on a desk with both hands in the air. Toji let out a huge laugh andplaced his hand on Shinji's shoulder. Shinji just stared at him not exactly in the mood for rough housing.  
"好了，真嗣，别这样，你让大家都不开心了。今天可是个好日子，从今天起，我们就要成为已婚男人了！" 健介站在桌子上，得意地高举双手宣布。彻治大笑起来，把手放在真嗣肩上。而真嗣只是默默地看着他，显然没有兴致参与嬉闹。

"Dude I hope you made the most of being a bachelor last night cause today we are taken!" Both Toji andKensuke grabbed their drinks and took a big manly gulp.  
"兄弟，希望你昨晚尽情享受了单身之夜，因为今天我们都有伴了！" 东治和健介拿起饮料，豪爽地大口畅饮。

Hikari overheard the screaming boys, how couldn't she, they were really loud. She rolled her eyes but wasreminding of the crisis at hand. Asuka paused as well but didn't take any interest in them, "What idiots," shemuttered.  
光里不可能听不到那些男孩的尖叫，他们的声音实在太大了。她翻了个白眼，但立刻想起了当前的紧急情况。明日香也停下脚步，却对他们毫无兴趣，低声骂道：“一群蠢货。”

"What did you say Asuka!" screamed Toji even louder in her direction.  
"你刚才说什么，明日香！" 东治更大声地朝她吼道。

"Oh you really want to know what I said…" she leaned against her leg that was on the chair with a sinister lookon her face. "I said you were—"  
哦，你真想知道我刚才说了什么…" 她斜倚在搭在椅子上的腿上，脸上掠过一抹阴险的神色。"我说你是——

"IDIOTS!" screamed Hikari at the top of her lungs. The whole class gasped at this sudden hostilitytowards Kensuke and Toji. Rei glanced at her rowdy classmates but quickly looked away and Tojiimmediately noticed. Hikari's face turned an even darker red, "I HATE YOU!" The teacher walked into the room and Hikari turned resembling a deer blinded by headlights. "All rise," she said in barely awhisper and stood. The whole class stood yet again feeling the dread of anticipation. "…Sit." As usualthe sensei took his sweet time but it was well understood considering the fact that he was a very old man.  
"白痴！"光声嘶力竭地喊道，全班同学都被她突然对健介和徹二的敌意吓了一跳。丽扫了一眼喧闹的同学们，随即又转开了目光，徹二立刻察觉到了。光的脸上红得更加厉害，"我恨你！"这时老师走进了教室，光顿时显得手足无措，如同被车灯惊吓的小鹿。"全体起立，"她低声说道，随即站了起来。全班同学再次起立，心中充满了不安的期待。"…坐下。"老师一如既往地慢条斯理，但考虑到他的高龄，大家也都理解。

He gathered all of his papers on his desk and made them into one nice, perfect stack and he made sureof that. He slowly made his way to the front of the class and cleared his throat, the class then sighed.  
他把桌上的所有文件收集起来，整理成一叠整齐完美的纸堆，并仔细检查了一遍。他缓缓走向教室前方，清了清嗓子，全班随即发出一阵叹息。

"Ok, I'm sure you're all excited about getting married today…so," his voice was monotone as usualand it took all the excitement, if any, out of the teenagers. He cleared his voice, "Well you're all marriednow." Toji twitched a little, all this for nothing? He felt a little let down as well as everyone else in the roomat the moment excluding Hikari who was still trying to keep herself from hyperventilating. The sensei blanklystared at the class and then turned back to his desk, gotthe pile of papers he had tried so hard to evenout and passed them out to each row.  
"好的，我相信你们今天都为结婚而激动不已……所以，"他那惯常的单调声音，仿佛吸走了所有可能的兴奋。他清了清嗓子，"那么，你们现在都已成婚。"东二不禁抽搐了一下，这一切难道都是白费力气？他和房间里的其他人一样感到失望，除了光，她还在努力避免自己因激动而喘不过气来。老师面无表情地扫视全班，随后转身回到桌前，拿起那叠他费尽心思整理的文件，逐一发给每一排。

Toji turned and passed the worksheet to Shinji with a snicker on his face. "Understand, you will have tospend a certain amount of time with your wife or husband preferably a minimum of two hours. You will usethis worksheet to log each day and then at the end of this whole project you will have to write a four pageessay about both your experience and how marriage has changed before and after second impact."  
东治转过身，脸上带着一丝窃笑，将工作表递给真嗣。“记住，你需要与配偶共度一段时间，建议每天至少两小时。利用这份工作表记录每日情况，项目结束时，你要撰写一篇四页的论文，描述你的体验以及第二次冲击前后婚姻的变迁。”

"Now that was a long sentence, did he even breathe?" muttered Toji under his breath, "That old mansure is full of something and it's not oxygen…"  
那句话可真够长的，他都不用喘气吗？" 透二低声自语，"那老头儿脑子里装的肯定不是氧气……

"Excuse me Suzahara, what did you say?" said the teacher stunning Toji.  
"不好意思，Suzahara，您刚才说什么？"老师的话让 Toji 感到震惊。

"Umm…urrr…," he pulled at his collar nervously and turned, "I said that this is such a great idea."  
呃…嗯…," 他紧张地拽了拽衣领，转身说道，"我说这主意真是太棒了。

"NO NO THAT'S NOT WHAT HE SAID," screamed Hikari with her finger pointing at him, "Sensei, hesaid that you were full of shit!" The whole class gasped even more, something was seriously wrong withHikari even Asuka was worried.  
"不不，他说的不是那个！"光尖叫着指着他，"老师，他说你满口谎言！"全班更加震惊，光的情况显然很不对劲，连明日香都感到担忧。

"Umm Hikari," she placed her hand on Hikari's wrist, "Calm down Hikari." She then whispered with caution,"Don't take it out on Toji, you'll get him…" she muttered even lower to herself, "But I doubt he's worth it."  
嗯，光，"她轻触光的腕部，"冷静下来，光。"随后她谨慎地低语，"别对时发火，你会让他……"她对自己小声嘀咕，声音更加低沉，"但我怀疑他是否真的值得。

"I DID NOT SAY THAT," Toji jumped up full of anger. "  
"我可没说过那种话！" 东二怒气冲冲地跳了起来。

"That's it you two, see me in detention!" he screamed even getting Rei's attention.  
"就是你们俩，放学后到我这儿来接受留堂！"他的尖叫声连 Rei 都注意到了。

"What! What! NOOOOOOOOO!" exclaimed both Toji and Hikari.  
"什么？！什么？！不——！" Toji 和 Hikari 异口同声地惊叫。

---

Asuka walked out the door, class was over and she was a little tired out especially with the big mess Hikarimade. It was so out of character for her to be acting this badly and over Toji of all people. There was nothingattractive about Toji what so ever and he shows no good traits. As she was pondering she was standing bythe doorway holding her book bag in her arms. Shinji came up behind her and placed his finger on her shoulder.  
明日香走出教室，课程已结束，她略感疲惫，尤其是因为光里引起的那场大混乱。她竟因东治而行为失常，实在出人意料。东治并无吸引之处，也未显露任何优点。她站在门口，怀抱书包，陷入沉思。此时，真嗣悄然走近，轻触她的肩膀。

"Umm we're supposed to spend time together today," he gulped once Asuka stopped daydreaming.  
"嗯，我们今天本该一起共度时光，"他咽了咽口水，此时 Asuka 从白日梦里回过神来。

"We don't have to Shinji," she started walking away and Shinji stumbled after her helplessly.  
"我们没必要这样，真嗣。" 她转身离去，真嗣则无助地跟了上去。

"But…"

"You know you could just lie on the log. I doubt the teacher will even notice," she quickened her pace butShinji was still trailing behind her until he managed to catch up.  
"你完全可以躺在那根木头上。我猜老师根本不会察觉，"她加快脚步，而 Shinji 还在后面追赶，直到他终于追上。

"That's wrong and you know it," he stared at her peeved with her lack of conscience.  
"你明知道那是错的，"他盯着她，因她的良知缺失而感到不悦。

"Geez Shin-chan you're such a goodie goodie," she huffed looking the other way. "You know I can't bestuck in a room with such a baka like you."  
哎呀，新之助，你真是太老实了，"她气鼓鼓地扭过头，"我可受不了和像你这样的傻瓜关在一起。

"Fine, I'll just follow you around then," he was actually taking a stand against the fiery vixen. She smiled alittle liking this sudden burst of aggression.  
"行，那我就跟着你吧，"他其实是在对那位火辣的女子表示抗议。她嘴角微扬，对这突如其来的强势颇为欣赏。

"Oh really," she said flirtatiously, Shinji was taken aback, "Fine then."  
哦，真的呀？" 她带着挑逗的语气说，真嗣一时不知所措，"那就这样吧。

---

School may have been over for Asuka and Shinji, but Toji and Hikari sat alone in an isolated room without theteacher. They were separate from each other sitting at each opposite side. Toji glanced at Hikari, "You got mein trouble ya know."  
虽然学校已经放学，但明日香和真嗣不在场，东治和光两人独处于一间无人的教室中，彼此隔着一段距离坐在对面。东治看了眼光，说道：“你可真会给我找麻烦啊。”

"I know," she muttered regretfully.  
"我知道，"她带着遗憾轻声说道。

"What did I do to you to get you so pissed? I don't remember doing anything."  
我究竟做了什么让你如此恼火？我实在想不起来有任何冒犯之处。

"You weren't my husband," she said softly. Toji stared at her with wide eyes.  
"你并非我的丈夫，"她轻声说道。Toji 睁大眼睛凝视着她。

"What!" That just threw him off, he didn't know what was wrong with her.  
"什么！" 这话让他一头雾水，完全不明白她怎么了。

"I'm sorry," he eyes became huge and watery.  
"对不起，" 他的双眼瞪得大大的，泪水汪汪。

"Oh I know what's wrong with you…" he smiled and whispered with caution, "You must be on yourmenstrual cycle."  
哦，我明白你的不适了……"他微笑着轻声提醒，"你应该是经期到了。

"Huh!" she screamed with this sudden accusation.  
"啊！"她面对这突如其来的指控惊叫起来。

"Isn't that when you girls get all confused and stuff," he asked her testing her temper.  
"不正是你们女孩子这时候容易感到困惑之类的吗？"他试探性地问她，看她反应如何。

"Oh I hate you!" she picked up all of her books, "I've stayed long enough!" She left the room in a huff leavingToji.  
"哦，我真讨厌你！" 她收拾起所有书籍，"我在这儿已经待够了！" 她气冲冲地离开了房间，留下 Toji 一人。

"Ah so I was right…" he said, stroking his chin.  
"啊，看来我没说错……"他边说边抚摸着下巴。

Asuka walked into her room and grabbed a stopwatch. She was in a good mood at the moment, she was gladthat her act got some sort of attention from Shinji. He wanted to do the right thing or he just wanted to be withher, personally she didn't really know but maybe she did. Her smiled widened a little bit, she became almostdreamy. There was no way to explain this but she liked him…a lot. A voice came from the living room.  
明日香步入房间，随手拿起一只秒表。此刻她心情愉悦，因为自己的行为成功吸引了真嗣的注意。真嗣是出于责任感还是单纯想与她相伴，她心中并无定论，或许她已有所察觉。她的笑容不自觉地加深，整个人仿佛沉浸在甜蜜的梦境中。这种感觉难以言表，但她确实对他倾心不已。此时，客厅传来了一道声音。

"Asuka did you find it," Shinji said.  
"Asuka，找到了吗？" 真嗣问道。

"Yeah I got it you baka," she walked from her room to the living room in her typical stride. Her finger pressedon the start button and a high pitched beep was heard from the stopwatch. "What do you propose we do."She sat next to the teenager on the floor and leaned her arms against the top of the table with her eyes lockedinto his. This whole show hypnotized Shinji only left with a goofy smile. It was just the way that she carriedherself, she was nothing like him. She was what was missing from him, possibly what he could have been underdifferent circumstances. Asuka wasn't perfect but she was pretty close.  
"嗯，我懂了，你这傻瓜，"她像往常一样从房间走向客厅。手指轻触启动键，计时器随即发出尖锐的哔声。"你有什么打算？"她坐在少年身旁，双臂搭在桌上，目光紧紧锁定他。这场景让真嗣看得入迷，只留下一脸傻笑。她的一举一动都与他迥异。她填补了他生命中的空缺，或许在另一种境遇下，他也能成为那样的人。明日香虽非完美无瑕，却也近乎如此。

"I don't know," he scrambled to say after much thought. Her facial expression changed to one that wasdisappointed and bored.  
"我不清楚，"他思索良久后匆忙回答。她的表情随即转为失望与无聊。

"I see," she paused and looked the other way. "Why don't we just talk or something." Shinji didn't knowwhat to say after that but she was just staring back at him, expecting something, expecting anything. His mindwas rushing and nothing right would come out but he still opened his mouth letting whatever come out.  
"我懂了，"她顿了顿，目光移向别处。"要不我们聊聊天或者干点别的？" 真嗣一时语塞，而她只是静静地回望着他，眼神中满是期待。他的脑海一片混乱，找不到恰当的话语，但还是张开了嘴，让任何可能的话自然流出。

"You're really pretty," his eyes widened at what he said.  
"你真漂亮，"他因自己脱口而出的话而瞪大了眼睛。

"Well yeah, tell me something I don't already know," he felt her move a little closer than him but her wordswere so arrogant he didn't know what to think.  
"是啊，说点我不知道的吧，"他察觉到她比之前更近了一些，可她那傲慢的言辞让他无所适从。

"Heh heh," he scooted a little bit away from her, feeling himself get a little nervous. "Why don't we just see tv then."  
他干笑两声，稍稍挪开一些，感到一丝紧张。'要不，咱们就看会儿电视吧。'

"Hmm I guess, but isn't that boring. You should know there's nothing good on," suddenly a delightful idea hit her."Why don't we go out somewhere?"  
嗯，我猜也是，但那不是很无聊吗？你应该知道现在没什么好节目。"突然，她灵机一动，"要不我们出去逛逛？

"Huh," he turned with his face a dark red, did she mean a date?  
"啊？" 他转过身来，脸涨得通红，她是在暗示约会吗？

"Let me go get ready and we can go to the movies and eat out!" said Asuka enthusiastically. All Shinji heardwas the beep of the stop watch and all he saw was Asuka running to her room.  
"我去准备一下，然后咱们去看电影，再出去吃顿好的！" 明日香兴奋地说道。真嗣耳边只回荡着秒表的哔哔声，眼前则是明日香奔向房间的身影。

"…ok," he garbled. A few minutes passed before Asuka came out with dark red lipstick suiting her vibrantpersonality and red bows in her hair possibly ever article of clothing she had was red. She looked slightly irritatedwhen she looked at Shinji.  
"…好吧，" 他含糊地应道。过了几分钟，明日香才现身，她涂着深红色的口红，与她那充满活力的性格十分相称，头发上还别着红色蝴蝶结，似乎她身上的每一件衣物都是红色的。当她看向真嗣时，脸上带着一丝不悦。

"Well are you ready yet!"  
怎么样，你准备好了吗？

Ooo so what do you think is going to happen next? Ha only I can know! Well at least until I finish the nextchapter. Will Asuka and Shinji's date go well? Will Hikari finally convince Toji that she isn't on her period?Will anything ever happen to Kensuke? Will Misato randomly come out of nowhere with advice? Will Rei everlook at something other than out a window? And what new horrible assignment will bring out a new side out of Shinjithat will either win a girl or disgust her? Well only your reviews will help me reveal answers to these questions or morequestions to these questions. Please review and criticize me! Tear me apart man!  
哦，你觉得接下来会发生什么？哈哈，只有我知道答案！至少在下一章完成之前。明日香和真嗣的约会能顺利吗？光能否让东治相信她并没有来月经？健介身上会发生什么吗？美里会不会突然出现给出建议？零会不会关注窗外之外的事物？又会有什么新的艰巨任务让真嗣展现出新的一面，或是赢得女孩的心，或是让她反感？你们的评论将帮助我揭晓这些问题的答案，或是引发更多疑问。请留下你们的评论，尽情批评我吧！

### Chapter 4: What are you doing!  

Well this is swell, this chapter might answer questions like I said before and it might add even more questions. :D I'm warning yousomething crazy and unexpected will happen…well I don't know if its unexpected…but its gonna happen! Hope you like this newchapter which I am making even longer, or at least trying. Oh yeah thanks for the reviews and enjoy this! Cherrios!  
这一章或许能解答我之前提到的问题，也可能会引发更多疑问。:D 我得提醒你，会有一些疯狂且意想不到的事情发生……虽然我不确定是否真的出乎意料，但它即将上演！希望你喜欢这个新章节，我正尽力让它更加丰富。哦，感谢大家的点评，尽情享受阅读吧！再见！

Asuka walked arm and arm with Shinji clad with a huge smile on her face. She always wanted to do this sort of thing with her Shin-chan,to walk in a huge crowd showing off that he was hers. Well it wasn't official yet, but her dream of a perfect date had come true thanks tosome stupid project. She turned to Shinji, he looked terrified. His arm trembled and his face was pale. "Umm Shinji are you okay?"  
明日香挽着真嗣的手臂，脸上洋溢着灿烂的笑容。她一直憧憬着能和她的真嗣君这样在人潮中并肩而行，宣告他是她的。尽管关系尚未明朗，但某个无厘头的项目让她的完美约会梦想得以实现。她转头看向真嗣，发现他面露惧色。他的手臂微微颤抖，脸色显得苍白。“那个，真嗣，你没事吧？”

"Well…now that you ask," his face turned blue and he ran away. Asuka ran after him dreading the fact that she had to wear pumps. Shechased after him until he stopped and puked in an alley way.  
"哎…你这么一问，"他脸色煞白，拔腿就跑。明日香穿着高跟鞋，心中忐忑地追了上去。她紧追不舍，直到他在一条小巷里停下来呕吐。

"Oh," Asuka stopped, grasping onto her little red purse. Shinji looked up at her with his face a dark red realizing that he didn't escapefast enough to hide this horrible act. "Shin-chan…" she looked worried, she actually looked worried. Shinji couldn't realize what washappening before his eyes. Her face wasn't mean looking anymore, it actually provided some kind of comfort. "You shouldn't get sonervous around me," she smiled the most beautiful smile that he had ever seen.  
"哦，" 明日香停下脚步，紧握着她的小红包。真嗣抬头望向她，脸颊绯红，意识到自己未能及时逃离，以掩盖这尴尬的行为。"真嗣…" 她显得忧心忡忡，是真的在担心。真嗣一时无法理解眼前的情况。她的表情不再带有敌意，反而透出几分慰藉。"在我面前，你不必如此紧张，" 她绽放出他见过的最动人的笑容。

"Oh…no…I—I wasn't," he lifted himself up feeling the aching in his stomach disappear.  
"哦…不…我，我其实没有，"他撑起身子，腹部的疼痛随之消散。

"Wanna go home?"  
想回去吗？

"Oh…please…no," Shinji stammered avoiding eye contact from the beautiful girl that was his date and his wife…well not really.  
"哦…求你…别这样，" 新二结巴着，不敢直视那位美丽的女孩，她既是他的约会对象，又是他的妻子…其实并非如此。

"Well, I didn't know you were so eager to be with me," she said in her typical tone of voice. "Shall we proceed to dinner?"  
哎呀，真没想到你这么急着想和我一起，"她依旧用那熟悉的口吻说道。"那咱们去吃晚饭吧？

"Sure," he walked towards her and their arms intertwined yet again. She pulled his arm a little closer to her, a streak of red flashed uponhis face. They made their way to a ramen restaurant; after all, it was all they could afford. Asuka decided to buy the biggest bowl whileShinji bought the smallest. They sat down on the picnic tables to observe the current nightlife. Shinji started slirping away at his ramennoodles but Asuka just giggled a little.  
"当然，"他向她走去，两人的手臂再次交织在一起。她轻轻拉近他的手臂，脸上掠过一丝红晕。他们去了一家拉面店，毕竟这是他们能承担的极限。明日香点了最大份的拉面，而真嗣则选择了最小份。他们坐在户外的长椅上，观察着夜晚的喧嚣。真嗣开始大口吃面，而明日香则在一旁轻声笑了起来。

"You know Shinji…" she said and Shinji turned to her paying attention.  
"你知道的，真嗣…"她开口说道，真嗣随即转头面向她，全神贯注地聆听。

"Hmm?"

"I'm sorry for being such a bitch sometimes," she giggled again, lowering her head staring down at her bowl.  
"我有时确实挺刻薄的，真抱歉，"她再次咯咯笑起来，低头凝视着自己的碗。

"A bitch! No you aren't a bitch," Shinji scrambled to say almost spilling his soup.  
"你这话说得过分了！不，你绝不是那种人，" 真嗣慌忙辩解，差点让汤溅了出来。

"Oh come on, I know you and the other two stooges call me that all the time," she leaned her head against her fist staring into Shinji'seyes.  
"得了吧，我知道你和那两个家伙总这么叫我，"她头倚在拳头上，目光直视着真嗣。

"Well they do, and I think I have once…" his deep blue eyes stared into the wood of the picnic table. "But you do leave bruises!" Hescreamed almost desperate to defend himself.  
"确实，他们会的，我想我也有过一次……" 他深邃的蓝眼睛紧盯着野餐桌的木面。"可你真的会留下瘀痕！" 他几乎是绝望地尖叫，极力为自己辩解。

Asuka let out a hearty laugh and got closer to Shinji. Without breaking contact, her hand was placed on his. "You're really cute," herpink lips formed a smile.  
明日香放声大笑，向真嗣靠近。她没有松开手，轻轻地放在他的手上。"你真是个小可爱，"她粉嫩的唇边绽放出微笑。

Rei sat in Toji's room looking around at all the interesting posters and the unmade bed, just like home. A slight smile appeared on herface. Toji walked into the room holding two glasses filled with soda. "Here's something to drink," he handed it to her and she reached forit slowly as if she wasn't sure what to do.  
绫坐在东二的房间里，四周贴满了有趣的海报，床铺也未整理，一切都那么亲切。她脸上不禁浮现出微笑。东二端着两杯汽水走进来，递给她一杯说：“喝点东西吧。”她缓缓伸手接过，似乎还有些犹豫。

"Thank you," she spoke softly. Toji sat down on his bed comfortably and looked up at her.  
"谢谢你，"她轻声说道。Toji 舒适地坐在自己的床上，抬头望向她。

"So tell me about yourself."  
请谈谈你自己。

"There is nothing to say," she stared at the bubbles make their way to the top of the glass and then disappear.  
"无话可说，"她注视着气泡缓缓升至杯顶，随即消散。

"I'm sure there's something to say," he said trying to reassure her."There is nothing to say that isn't confidential," she reworded herself letting down Toji a little bit.  
"我肯定有些话能说，"他尽力安抚她。"只是没什么不涉及机密的，"她改口说，让 Toji 感到一丝失落。

"Oh I see," he paused feeling sweat drip down his face. "I guess I'll just tell you about myself"  
哦，我懂了，"他顿了顿，汗水从额头滑落。"我还是跟你说说我的事吧

"Proceed if you like," she said in her monotone voice.  
"你若愿意，就继续吧，"她以一贯的单调语气说道。

"I think you already know about my sister and that I'm fourteen years old just like you. I can't really say I have a favorite color but I dolove to be around my friends and play basketball."  
我想你已经了解我姐姐的情况，我俩同岁，都是十四。虽然我没有特别偏爱的颜色，但我很享受与朋友们一起打篮球的时光。

"That's nice, having friends."  
有朋友真好。

"You know, you should get some," he smiled warmly.  
"你知道的，你应该买一些。"他微笑着，语气温暖。

"Ikari is my friend," her eyes glistened.  
"Ikari 是我朋友，"她眼中闪烁着光芒。

"Huh? Shinji?" he felt his heart sink just looking at her thinking of Shinji.  
"什么？真嗣？" 他仅仅看着她，一想到真嗣，心就沉了下去。

"Yes, Ikari,"

"Oh…"

Hikari stared at Kensuke, he was possibly the most boring guy in the world. The whole time he had been talking about how much heloved stupid things, she never took time to actually remember what they were. She was walking back to her apartment with her headdown, too bad she didn't get Toji. She would actually be able to get to know him better, get to really see his sensitive side. He was sodreamy. She turned a light pink and stared into the starry sky above her.  
光凝视着健介，心想他或许是世上最无趣的人。他滔滔不绝地谈论自己对那些无聊事物的喜爱，她根本没心思去记那些内容。她低着头走回公寓，遗憾未能与东治相伴。若能与他相处，她定能更深入地了解他，窥见他内心的温柔。他那迷人的气质让她不禁脸颊泛红，仰望繁星点点的夜空。

Nothing was going to stop her! She would be willing to get Toji no matter what, be it the mysterious beauty of Rei, or the otaku…ish…  
任何困难都无法阻挡她！无论是神秘美女丽的诱惑，还是宅男气息，她都决心要得到冬二

ness of Kensuke! She raised her fist to the sky and shook it. "By God I will be your wife, Toji Suzahara! Nothing will stop me fromgetting what is rightfully mine! NOTHING!"  
“谦介的决心！她高举拳头向天，用力挥舞。‘我发誓，我将成为你的妻子，图吉·苏萨哈拉！没有任何事物能阻挡我得到我应得的一切！绝无可能！’”

Shinji sat in the dark movie theatre staring into the silver screen that was just playing ads. He let out a sigh as he still saved the seat next tohim for Asuka. She arrived with a huge popcorn and two drinks. "They had this deal where you get an extra extra extra large order ofpopcorn, you'd get two free drinks," she said happily barely managing to carry the gigantic popcorn.  
真嗣坐在昏暗的电影院中，目光凝视着播放广告的银幕。他轻叹一声，旁边仍为明日香保留着座位。她带着一大桶爆米花和两杯饮料走了进来。“这里有个活动，买超大份爆米花就送两杯饮料，”她开心地说，几乎抱不住那巨型爆米花。

"You didn't have to," Shinji laughed nervously.  
"其实你不必这么做，" 碇真嗣有些紧张地笑着说。

"NO NO I DID," she screamed at him suddenly sounding like the old Asuka he had known, so maybe he hadn't lost the girl he knew.  
"不，不，我真的做了，"她突然对他尖叫起来，声音恢复了往日明日香的模样，或许他并没有失去那个熟悉的她。

The movie started and everything became dark and quiet except for the shuffling of the people getting prepared. Asuka drank out of hersoda drink and then stared at Shinji who was staring at the screen. Her mouth turned upside down as she still drank.  
电影开场，四周陷入一片黑暗与宁静，唯有人们准备时的轻微响动。明日香啜饮着汽水，目光却投向了正凝视屏幕的真嗣。她的嘴角微微下垂，依旧在啜饮。

Shinji had the saddest looking blue eyes. So many horrible things had happened to him and she knew what exactly he was feeling despiteher fierce competitiveness against him. That would really make the relationship interesting, she laughed to herself. Imagine all the thingsthey could do together. She closed her eyes. "Chill out, it's only the first date…" she spoke in soft words. But it was the beginning ofsomething.  
真嗣那双蓝色的眼睛看起来异常悲伤。尽管她与他竞争激烈，却能深刻理解他所经历的苦难。她暗自笑想，这样的关系定会充满趣味。想象他们能共同经历的种种，她闭上眼，柔声自语：“放轻松，这只是初次约会……”然而，这正是某种开始。

The movie ended but not once did she even bother paying attention to it, she spent the whole time twiddling her thumbs as a billionthoughts passed through her head. Though it didn't seem like it Shinji had been feeling the exact same thing. The lights turned on slowlyand everyone stood up either applauding the film or booing at it. Feeling slightly disoriented Shinji and Asuka held onto each other as theystumbled down the stairs and then walked along an aisle leading to one bright doorway. "Well that was a great movie," Shinji said with aworried smile on his face trying to hide the fact that he lost interest in it quickly.  
电影落幕，她却未曾真正投入，全程不过是无聊地摆弄手指，思绪万千。看似平静的真嗣，内心其实与她共鸣。灯光渐亮，观众或鼓掌或嘘声，两人在迷茫中相扶，步履蹒跚地走下台阶，沿着通道向着光亮的出口前行。“嗯，真是部不错的电影，”真嗣面带忧虑的微笑，试图掩盖自己早已对电影失去兴趣的事实。

"Oh, it was really stupid the way that couple died," she quickly said as she shifted her eyes side to side.  
"哎，那对夫妇的死法真是蠢到家了，"她急忙说道，目光左右游移。

"Umm no one died in the movie…it was a romantic comedy…"  
电影里并没有人死去，它是一部浪漫喜剧。

Shinji and Asuka arrived at the dark apartment more or less falling through the doorway laughing. Asuka looked around the apartment,Misato wasn't home. She continued laughing and then held his hand when she reached her room. They both quieted down and Shinjiturned a dark red. Much to his surprise she leaned over and kissed him whole heartedly. He didn't know what to do in this sort ofsituation, he stumbled a little bit but then closed his eyes and kissed the red haired girl back. The feeling was mutual! The feeling wasmutual! He could have jumped up and down but then Asuka slid her door open but was still kissing him. She tried to pull him into theroom but he pulled back in his direction. "What are you doing?"  
碇真嗣和明日香笑着跌跌撞撞地进了昏暗的公寓。明日香环视四周，发现美里不在。她继续笑着，牵起真嗣的手走向自己的房间。两人渐渐安静下来，真嗣的脸颊泛起红晕。令他惊讶的是，明日香倾身过来，热情地吻了他。他一时不知所措，有些摇晃，但随即闭上眼，回应了红发女孩的吻。这份情感是相互的！他激动得几乎要跳起来，但此时明日香已拉开房门，依旧与他亲吻。她试图拉他进房，他却往后退。“你这是做什么？”

"It means I had a great time…" her arms embraced Shinji's small form. "I know it's the first date but I don't care," she softly with a slightlook of seductiveness on her face. Shinji was stunned.  
"这表示我玩得很开心……"她用双臂紧紧抱住真嗣瘦小的身体。"虽然这是第一次约会，但我并不介意，"她轻声细语，脸上掠过一抹妩媚。真嗣愣住了。

"What! What—what are you doing?" She smiled and shut him up with her own soft red lips and pulled him into her room by his collar.  
"什么！你这是做什么？" 她微笑着，用自己柔软的红唇堵住了他的话，一把拽着他的衣领将他拉进了房间。

Toji coughed nervously as he sat at the kitchen table with Rei being quiet as usual. Their conversation had gone nowhere the whole time.  
透二坐在餐桌旁，紧张地咳嗽着，而零依旧保持着一贯的沉默。整个对话过程中，他们的话题始终没有进展。

The two hours were filled with practically nothing but the noise of chopsticks against a bowl. Rei stood up quietly, "I assume that ourtime is now over…I must leave then." She didn't give Toji a chance to say anything, all he could hear was the door closing. One stepcloser, two steps back… Toji sighed and looked down at the floor feeling a blow to his heart. But he still had a flicker of hope, he wasgoing to make her open up. He was ready for what was to come next time they would meet, he smiled.  
那两小时里，几乎只有筷子敲击碗的声响。Rei 悄然起身，“看来我们的时间已尽……我该走了。”她没让 Toji 有开口的机会，他只听见门轻轻关上。一步向前，两步退后……Toji 叹息着，低头凝视地面，心痛如绞。然而，他心中仍存一丝希望，决心让 Rei 敞开心扉。他已为下次相见的挑战做好准备，嘴角露出一抹微笑。

Shinji stared at the mirror as he brushed his teeth in the bathroom. The bathroom door suddenly opened and it was Asuka. He jumpedback but she just smiled. "Hey Shin-chan," she walked over to the mirror and began to carefully fix her hair. Shinji felt his heart beatingfast and his hands began to shake. He didn't know what to do after what they did the night before, he was very scared of her. It didn'tseem to phase the beautiful vixen who stared at her reflection with a self satisfied look in her face. "Last night was nice," she put her redhair behind her ear and smirked, "Very nice" Shinji jumped even higher and dropped his toothbrush and toothpaste on the floor.  
真嗣在浴室刷牙时，目光紧锁着镜子。突然，浴室门被推开，明日香走了进来。他惊得往后一缩，她却只是嫣然一笑。“嘿，真嗣，”她走近镜子，开始细心打理头发。真嗣心跳如鼓，双手微颤。他不知如何是好，因为昨晚的事让他对她心生畏惧。然而，这位美艳的少女似乎对此毫不在意，她对着镜中的自己露出得意的微笑。“昨晚挺好的，”她将红发别至耳后，嘴角勾起一抹笑意，“真的挺好。”真嗣更是惊慌失措，手中的牙刷和牙膏应声落地。

"Areyou okay?"

"Yeah—yeah…" He backed away and suddenly skidded on the open toothpaste tube and fell. Much to his demise he fell on Asuka. Hisblue eyes widened when they locked into Asuka's light blue eyes. She smiled and rested her hands on his waist.  
"对啊—对啊…" 他后退时不慎踩到开口的牙膏管，脚下一滑，不巧摔在了明日香身上。四目相对，他的蓝眼睛与她那浅蓝色的眸子交织，不禁瞪大了眼。她微微一笑，双手轻轻搭在他的腰间。

"What want to recreate last night's events," she was about to kiss him when he pulled away from her grasp and stood up.  
她正打算重现昨晚的情景，就在她即将吻上他时，他却挣脱了她的手，站起身来。

"L—lets go to school," he left the bathroom leaving her confused on the floor.  
"L—我们去上学吧," 他离开浴室，让她独自在地板上感到困惑。

Misato sat in the kitchen feeding fish to Pen-pen who happily ate it. She looked up to see Shinji walking towards the door. "Hey Shin-chan?" He returned to the kitchen when he heard his name.  
美里坐在厨房，正喂鱼给企鹅 Pen-pen 吃，它吃得十分开心。她抬头望见真嗣正朝门口走去。"嘿，真嗣？" 听到呼唤，他转身回到了厨房。

"Yeah Misato?" he was sweating gallons and Misato frowned.  
"怎么了，Misato？" 他满头大汗，Misato 显得有些不悦。

"Are you hiding something from me."  
你是不是有什么事瞒着我？

"Uh…no—no," he loosened his collar. Misato couldn't help smiling.

"Oh I get it," she snickered and bit on her finger almost threateningly. "You and Asuka have gotten a little close haven't you!"  
哦，我懂了，"她窃笑一声，咬着手指，眼神中带着几分威胁。"你和明日香关系变得挺亲密的嘛！

"Wha—what! Nooooooooo," he exclaimed and suddenly ran out the door screaming.  
"什么——什么！不——"他惊呼一声，随即冲出门外，尖叫着跑开了。

Hikari shyly walked towards Toji who was silently sitting at his table without Kensuke. Hikari smiled, all her anger towards Toji hadfaded away with the thought of the bliss of being with him. He stared at the homework that was due that day with a cute puzzled look onhis face.  
光羞涩地走向独自坐在桌前的冬二，脸上绽放出微笑。想到与冬二相处的快乐时光，她心中的怒气已荡然无存。冬二正盯着当天必须完成的作业，脸上带着一副可爱的困惑神情。

"Hey Toji," she said as she leaned her hands against his table. He looked up looking a little tired.  
"嘿，东次，" 她边说边将双手撑在他的桌上。他抬头望去，神情略显疲倦。

"Hey," he smiled a little. "Are you off your period now?" She twitched a little but the anger grew fainter in her face. The frown became asmile yet again.  
"嘿，"他嘴角微扬，"你月经期已经过去了吗？"她身体微动，脸上的怒意渐消，眉头舒展，再次露出笑容。

"So how is it going with Rei?"  
Rei 最近怎么样？

"Oh its fine, I guess…but she doesn't really say anything," he looked concerned with this but the look of optimism shined in his eyes, "ButI'm goin to try to make her open up ya know."  
哦，看来还行…只是她没怎么开口，"他面露忧色，但眼中仍透出乐观，"我会努力让她吐露心声的，你明白的。

"Oh that's great," she giggled, she admired his kindness so much, she blushed a little even though he was speaking of some other girl. "Ihope she does, it would really make her more approachable."  
哦，那真好，"她笑着说，非常钦佩他的善良，尽管他提到的是另一个女孩，她还是不禁脸红。"希望她能做到，那样她会显得更亲切。

"Yeah that's why I'm doing this I think…" he scratched his nose deep in thought, yet another thing that Hikari was fond of. SuddenlyAsuka entered the room triumphantly and signaled for Hikari to go talk to her. Hikari nodded with a frown. Asuka then sighed and satdown feeling disappointed that she couldn't share her news. Shinji sat in the corner of the room looking pale and still shaking. Toji turnedto look at him because Shinji's shivering was making his desk move. "Shinji? What's wrong!" Hikari growled at Shinji when she finallylost Toji's attention.  
"对，我想这就是我这么做的原因……"他若有所思地挠了挠鼻子，这又是光喜欢的一个小动作。突然，明日香得意地走进房间，示意光过去和她交谈。光皱着眉头点头同意。明日香叹了口气坐下，因无法分享她的消息而感到失望。真嗣坐在房间一角，面色苍白，身体仍在颤抖。东治转头看向他，因为真嗣的颤抖让桌子都动了。"真嗣？你怎么了！"光终于忍不住对真嗣吼道，因为她发现东治的注意力已经不在她身上了。

"Na—na nothing…," his face was pale and he rocked back and forth. The teacher walked into the room making Hikari almost fall off thetable she was leaning on. She stumbled back up.  
"没什么…" 他面色苍白，身体不由自主地前后摇摆。老师步入教室，使得原本倚靠在桌边的 Hikari 险些跌落。她赶紧稳住身形。

"Everyone stand!" The whole class stood up. "Sit." She let out a breath and then sat down at her own desk with her head down.  
"全体起立！"全班同学随即站起。"请坐。"她轻吐一口气，低头坐在了自己的座位上。

"Ok students," he exhaled and a smile appeared on his old wrinkled face. "Congratulations you are now with child!" There was silence inthe room but out of nowhere Shinji let out a scream and ran out of the room. The teacher cleared his throat. "Sadly we can not recreatethe whole process," all the boys grumbled to themselves angrily. "But we can skip to the parenting skills." From under the table he pulledout a huge carton of eggs. He handed them to Hikari, "Please give these out to all the females in the room."  
同学们，"他深吸一口气，脸上皱纹间浮现出微笑，"恭喜大家，现在你们都有孩子了！"房间内顿时鸦雀无声，突然，真嗣尖叫着冲出了房间。老师清了清喉咙，"可惜我们无法重现整个过程，"男生们不满地低声抱怨。"不过，我们可以直接学习育儿技巧。"他从桌下拉出一个大鸡蛋盒，递给光，"请把这些分给在场的所有女生。

"Yes, sensei." Said Hikari.  
"是的，老师。"光回答道。

Asuka stared at her egg. "Pfft, this is nothing like a child."  
明日香凝视着自己的蛋，嗤之以鼻：“哼，这哪能跟养孩子相提并论。”

"Ahh but it is as fragile as a newborn child," the sensei answered, "For two weeks you will take care of these eggs…I mean children, as ifthey were your own."  
啊，但它如同新生儿般脆弱，" 老师说道，"接下来的两周，你要像对待自己孩子一样呵护这些蛋……我是说孩子。

"But don't babies cry a lot when they're barely born?"  
新生儿刚出生时，不都会哭得很厉害吗？

"Stop showing them all the flaws of the project, Asuka," he screamed making all the students quiet again. He looked around the roomawkwardly and loosened his collar feeling sweat drip down his face.  
"别再揭露项目的所有瑕疵了，明日香，"他高声喊道，令所有学生再次噤声。他尴尬地环视教室，松开领口，汗水顺着脸颊滑落。

"Umm just record your process."  
嗯，把你的操作过程录下来。

Misato knocked on Shinji's door and leaned her head against it. "Shin-chan, open the door. I'm worried about you."  
美里敲响了真嗣的房门，额头轻抵门板。"真嗣，把门打开。我真的很担心你。"

Tee hee! Will Shinji tell Misato his problems? Will Rei say even more than she did before! Will Kensuke actually say anything important!  
嘻嘻！真嗣会向美里倾诉烦恼吗？绫波会不会比之前透露更多呢！健介真的会说出什么关键信息吗！

Will Shinji ever stop shaking! And will this egg mean more that you think? Hope you liked this new chapter…its not long enough, I knowbut I try! Review people please review!  
真嗣何时才能停止颤抖呢！而这个鸡蛋是否蕴含着超出你想象的深意？希望你喜欢这一新篇章……虽不长，我已尽心尽力！请留下你的评论，期待大家的反馈！
