**A/N:** this has probably been done to death considering how old this fandom is and how very late i am to the party. but the idea wouldn't leave me alone, so i wrote this in one sitting when i should have been making dinner. i honestly think that this episode could have been as pivotal as episode 15. unfortunately, evangelion is a story about misunderstandings and missed connections (among other things), so this remains an idle daydream.  
A/N: 鉴于这个粉丝群体的历史悠久以及我加入的时机之晚，这个话题可能已经被反复讨论。然而，这个念头始终萦绕心头，让我在应该准备晚餐时一气呵成地写下了这段文字。我真心觉得这一集本可以像第 15 集那样具有转折意义。可惜，《新世纪福音战士》讲述的是误解与错失交集的故事（还有其他元素），因此这只能是一个闲暇时的幻想。

i do not own neon genesis evangelion or any characters therein.  
我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》及其任何角色。

Their faces are pushed rudely, awkwardly together, hair smeared between foreheads, noses mashed against each other. Shinji's eyes slide shut. Her lips are soft, a little chapped, but so _warm_ – how could another person be this warm? It makes something in him shudder, almost like it's in pain, and he fights a sudden lump in his throat. But then her mouth moves against his, and the howl of the SDAT ends in a loud, abrupt click, and he feels wetness on his face. He twitches violently, breaking the contact – "Mama," Asuka murmurs, and then her eyelids lift. Shinji feels a swooping horror in his gut like he's on a rollercoaster, but it's too late. Asuka's eyes open fully and focus on his, widening in surprise. A tear slips out of one of them and makes its way along her nose, seemingly unnoticed.  
他们的脸庞被粗鲁而尴尬地紧贴在一起，发丝在额头间交缠，鼻子相互挤压。真嗣闭上了眼睛。她的唇瓣柔软，略显干裂，却异常温暖——一个人怎会如此温暖？这让他内心颤动，仿佛承受着某种痛楚，他努力抑制住喉咙中的哽咽。然而，当她的唇在他唇上轻轻移动，SDAT 的嚎叫声戛然而止，化为一声突兀的咔嗒，他感到脸颊上的湿润。他猛地一颤，打破了这亲密的接触——“妈妈，”明日香轻声呢喃，随后她的眼睑缓缓抬起。真嗣感到一阵如同过山车般的恐惧在腹中翻腾，但为时已晚。明日香的眼睛完全睁开，目光聚焦在他身上，流露出惊讶。一滴泪珠悄然滑落，沿着她的鼻梁缓缓流淌，似乎未被察觉。

His face is hot. He can't breathe, can't move. Forget the angel – he's going to die right here, right now, drowning in the depths of Asuka's fiery eyes, so hot they burn blue. But the moment stretches – the slap doesn't come, the outraged shrieks don't fill the apartment.  
他的脸庞滚烫。他无法呼吸，动弹不得。别提什么天使了——他即将在此刻此地丧命，沉溺于明日香那炽烈如火的眼眸深处，那双眼热得发蓝，仿佛能将人灼伤。然而，时间似乎凝固了——预期的耳光并未到来，愤怒的尖叫声也未曾填满整个房间。

"Well?" Asuka murmurs lowly, her breath hot against his mouth. "What are you waiting for? Are you going to kiss me or not?"  
嗯？" 明日香低声细语，气息热切地拂过他的唇边。"你还在犹豫什么？到底要不要吻我？

Shinji can't believe what he's hearing. He swallows thickly. His heart pounds. The urge to recoil is incredibly strong. It would be the easy thing to do: run away to his room, where it's safe, where everything _makes sense._ Where her eyes aren't drilling into him, full of unshed tears and something like a question and something _else,_ something he doesn't know the name for, unyielding and brittle and soft all at once.  
真嗣几乎无法相信自己所听到的。他艰难地咽了咽口水，心跳如鼓。强烈的退缩欲望袭来。逃避似乎是最简单的选择：跑回自己的房间，那里安全，一切井然有序。在那里，她的目光不会如此深邃地穿透他，眼中含着未落的泪珠，带着疑问，还有某种他无法名状的情感，既坚定又脆弱，同时又温柔。

Her mouth was so warm. So warm.  
她的唇间温暖如春。那份温暖，令人难忘。

He shuts his eyes and pushes past his fear.  
他闭上双眼，奋力超越内心的恐惧。

He's never kissed anyone. He's never been kissed. She moves her mouth against his, gently, clumsily, so he does the same. It's _awkward_, extremely terrifying yet bizarrely sweet. His stomach is fluttering. Any moment now she's going to pull away and scoff and tell him how horrible he is at this and how much she really hates him, truly, forever, and he will fall apart. But instead of doing any of these things, Asuka makes a soft noise in her throat and presses herself against him. One of her hands tangles in his hair and it feels like a whole country's worth of electricity is being funneled from the minute points where her fingers meet his scalp down through his spine, his legs, the soles of his feet. He's been transmuted, no longer a boy of flesh and blood but a concentrated beam of energy, hurtling helplessly into the abyss. Was this how the Fifth Angel felt before it died howling? His right hand finds itself on her waist – her _waist!_ – where it clenches and unclenches spasmodically, unable to believe the reality of what it grasps.  
他从未吻过任何人，也从未被吻过。她轻轻地、笨拙地将自己的唇贴上他的，他便同样回应。这一刻既尴尬又极其可怕，却又出奇地甜蜜。他的胃在翻腾。随时她都可能推开他，嘲笑他在这方面有多糟糕，以及她有多么真正地、永远地恨他，他会崩溃的。但阿斯卡并没有做这些事，而是从喉咙里发出一声轻柔的声响，紧紧地贴向他。她的一只手缠绕在他的头发里，感觉就像整个国家的电力从她手指触及他头皮的微小点上，通过他的脊椎、双腿、脚底传递下来。 他已被转化为一束浓缩的能量，不再是血肉之躯的男孩，无助地冲向深渊。这难道就是第五使徒在惨叫中死去前的感受吗？他的右手不由自主地放在她的腰间——她的腰！——那里紧握又松开，痉挛般地，无法相信所触及的真实。

Things have spiraled completely out of control. He concludes that perhaps the past week of focused proximity has driven him insane and isn't sure whether to laugh or cry.  
事态已经彻底失控。他觉得，也许过去一周的紧密相处让他精神错乱，现在他不知道是该笑还是该哭。

Asuka makes another little noise. His heart skips a beat. She's so warm. He's so warm. He can't remember ever feeling so warm in his life. The hand on her waist slides to her back, embracing her more fully. At that, Asuka deepens the kiss, mashing her face into his. He yelps when she unexpectedly shoves her tongue in his mouth, and then his whole body jerks as she bites his bottom lip _hard_. Then she breaks the kiss, wriggling so that her face is pushed into his chest. Her arms clamp around him, holding him tightly to her.  
明日香再次发出轻微的声响。他的心跳不由得漏了一拍。她的温暖，他的温暖，他一生中从未感受过如此的温暖。他放在她腰间的手缓缓滑向她的背部，更深地拥抱着她。这一刻，明日香加深了吻，将脸庞紧贴在他的脸上。她突然将舌头伸入他的口中，他不禁惊叫，随即全身因她用力咬住他的下唇而猛地一颤。随后，她结束了这个吻，扭动身体，将脸埋进他的胸膛。她的双臂紧紧环绕着他，将他牢牢拥入怀中。

"That was for trying to sneak one while I was asleep," she mumbles. "Stupid pervert. Stop shaking. Are you cold or something?"  
“那是因为你趁我睡觉时想偷袭，”她低声抱怨，“真是蠢变态。别抖了，你冷吗？”

Shinji shakes his head, unable to speak. He probes his mouth delicately with his tongue – _Asuka's_ tongue was there, moments ago, rendering it completely unfamiliar territory – and encounters raw, tender flesh. "Ah…Asuka," he says. "You made my lip bleed."  
真嗣摇摇头，无法言语。他轻柔地用舌头探索口腔，那里片刻前还是明日香的舌头所在，如今却变得全然陌生，触碰到了红肿而敏感的肉。“啊……明日香，”他轻声说道，“你让我嘴唇出血了。”

"Good. You deserve it." 很好，这是你应得的。

She tangles her legs with his, preventing him from getting up and assessing the damage. Shinji swallows down coppery saliva, opting for the path of least resistance.  
她用双腿缠住他的，阻止他起身查看受损情况。真嗣咽下那带有金属味的唾液，选择了最省力的方式。

"Heh. Your heart is beating so fast," Asuka murmurs. She sounds very smug.  
"呵呵，你的心跳得好快啊，" 明日香低语道，语气中带着几分得意。

Shinji takes a deep breath. And another. And another. The tremors cease. Asuka is warm and very, very close. Her breathing deepens and evens out in a matter of moments. Shinji, in contrast, has never felt more awake, gaze fixed on the sideboard on the opposite wall. He's not sure what just happened. She'd seemed so forceful, earlier, warning him to keep out of Misato's room. Something about walls. _And now it's time for children to go to bed!_ she'd said, and slammed the door.  
真嗣深吸一口气，接着又是一口，再一口。颤抖终于停止了。明日香的身体温暖而紧贴，她的呼吸很快变得深沉而均匀。与此相反，真嗣却感到前所未有的清醒，目光紧紧锁定在对面的墙柜上。他不太确定刚才发生了什么。之前，明日香显得那么坚决，警告他远离美里小姐的房间，提到了关于“墙”的事情。然后她突然宣布：“现在该是孩子们睡觉的时间了！”随即重重地关上了门。

_Mama…_

His face twists into a frown. "You're just a child yourself," he mutters to the girl in his arms. She snuffles in her sleep, oblivious.  
他的面容扭曲，皱起了眉头。“你自己也不过是个孩子。”他低声对怀中的女孩说道。她在睡梦中轻轻抽泣，全然不知。

Asuka's arms are still tight around him. When was the last time Shinji was held like this? Misato has never hugged him. Nor Ayanami, nor Toji, nor Kensuke, nor Horaki, nor Dr. Akagi, nor his teacher, nor anyone at the school he went to before arriving in Tokyo-3. Nor his father. Maybe his mother, but he can't remember much beyond a vague impression of warmth and tender softness.  
明日香的双臂依旧紧紧拥抱着他。真嗣上一次被如此拥抱是在何时？美里从未拥抱过他，绫波、冬二、健介、洞木、赤木博士、他的老师，以及他来到第三新东京市之前的学校的所有人，都没有拥抱过他。他的父亲也没有。或许他的母亲曾拥抱过他，但他只记得一些模糊的温暖和柔软的印象。

His throat is tight. His heart has started beating much too fast again. He feels dizzy. He takes great gulps of air like a man drowning. Suddenly this warmth is too much. Burning hot. It hurts. It hurts. He shudders, breath hitching, wanting nothing more than to crawl away, out of his skin and into familiar cold darkness. It's all too much.  
他的喉咙紧绷，心跳再次加速，快得异常。他感到头晕目眩，像溺水者般大口喘气。突然，这股温暖变得过于强烈，灼热得令人痛苦。他颤抖着，呼吸急促，只想逃离，摆脱这身皮囊，回到熟悉的冰冷黑暗中。这一切都让他难以承受。

Asuka stirs a little against him. Asuka. She's gripping him so tightly, like she wants him near her. Like it's all right for him to be near her.  
明日香在他怀里微微挪动。她紧紧抓着他，仿佛渴望他的陪伴。仿佛他靠近她是理所当然的。

If he moves, he will wake her up. He swallows. Not an optimal outcome. She needs her rest. But then…  
如果他动一下，她就会被吵醒。他咽了咽口水，这不是理想的结果。她现在需要好好休息。然而……

He goes still as a new thought occurs to him.  
他突然静止，脑海中闪现出一个新想法。

When was the last time anyone hugged Asuka? What if she is like him? What if she'd never been hugged either?  
上次有人拥抱明日香是什么时候？如果她和他是同类怎么办？如果她也从未被拥抱过呢？

His arms, so loosely resting on her before, tighten convulsively. He buries his face in her hair. It's very soft and smells very sweet. She'll probably be mad in the morning that his tears are getting it all wet.  
他的手臂原本轻柔地搭在她身上，此刻却紧紧地搂住了她。他将脸深埋于她的秀发之中，那发丝柔软至极，散发着淡淡的甜香。或许到了早晨，她会因他的泪水沾湿了头发而感到恼怒。

Far away, a train howls mournfully in the night.  
夜幕中，远方传来火车凄凉的汽笛声。

[Norsehound](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/76887/Norsehound): what a sweet little WAFF fic! it will be interesting to see Misato's reaction to Shinji's lip injury, but this was enough. thank you for sharing it!  
这篇小 WAFF 文真是甜美！真嗣的唇伤会让美里有何反应，令人期待，但光是这篇就已足够精彩。感谢分享！

**Born2Walken**: Damn Noodles first Eva fic ever is it’s an absolute doozy! I’ve read plenty of great 5k worded one offs but this is a messily 1k and it’s wonderful! Not since reading Genocide can I remember a better description of Asuka and Shinji have a real non episode 15 first kiss. To call it passionate would be an understatement but it’s also appropriately awkward at the same time. Your 100% right about the fact that episode 9 could’ve been a potential turning point for the two as Asuka gives him multiple hints and the fact nothing happens that night is probably why it took till episode 15 for her to seriously try again. You also understand to a tee how Shinji would feel being kissed and held in a loving way as you said your self in the story this is a boy who hasn’t been kissed or hugged since he was three years old and the prettiest girl he’s ever met is kissing him. Your description of his head going crazy and being overjoyed, completely terrified and also feeling uncomfortable as if he’s overdosing on a substance he’s bodies never had perfect is all spot on. The Eureka moment of realizing that this previously thought unattainable girl might actually be as lonely as he is and that is what gives him the courage to stay and hug her as tight as she’s needs to be held is what asushin is about, seeing that people are so much more then what they seem on the outside. It’s so kino in so few words! Ps Asuka biting Shinji lip and being smug about the effect she’s having on Shinji is peak Asuka!  
这部名为《该死的面条》的小说，作为伊娃的首作，确实非同凡响！我虽阅过不少精彩的五千字短篇，但这部仅千字的作品却以其杂乱无章之美打动了我。自《屠杀》之后，我再未见过如此生动描绘明日香与真嗣在第 15 集之外的初次真挚亲吻的场景。说它充满激情都显得轻描淡写，同时它又恰如其分地带着一丝尴尬。你提到的第 9 集确实本应成为两人的转折点，明日香在那集中多次暗示，而那晚的无所作为，或许正是导致她直到第 15 集才再次认真尝试的原因。 你完全理解了真嗣在被爱意包围的亲吻和拥抱中会是什么感觉，正如你在故事中所描述的，这是一个自三岁起就没有被亲吻或拥抱过的男孩，而他见过的最漂亮的女孩正在亲吻他。你生动地描绘了他的头脑一片混乱，既欣喜若狂又完全恐惧，同时还感到不舒服，仿佛他正在过量摄入一种身体从未接触过的物质，这一切都恰到好处。意识到这个曾经认为遥不可及的女孩可能和他一样孤独，正是这种领悟给了他勇气留下来紧紧拥抱她，正如她需要被拥抱的那样，这就是《Eureka》的精髓所在，看到人们远比他们外表所展现的要多得多。用如此简短的文字表达出如此深刻的情感，真是太精彩了！ 明日香咬住真嗣的嘴唇，得意洋洋地展示她对真嗣的影响，这正是明日香的巅峰表现！

[skyf0x](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/14765557/skyf0x): That was simple and beautiful story. Not too long for something like that, not too short either. Somehow, despite the biggest divergence in the line of the evens, the described scene stayed partially true to the original one, in terms of the feelings and thoughts Shinji has. I'd argue against that this certain idea has been tackled to death. This "kiss" moment in the Eva timeline usually doesn't get much of attention, people are mostly not interested for this to turn into real kiss, because of certain details, I believe. But still, I think it was a good choice for such story.  
这是一个简洁而动人的故事，长度恰到好处。尽管情节发展有所偏离，但描绘的场景在真嗣的情感和思绪上，仍与原作保持了一定的契合。我并不认同这种构思已被过度使用。在《EVA》的历史脉络中，这个“亲吻”瞬间往往未受重视，人们多半不期待它成为现实中的亲吻，我猜想是出于某些细节的考量。然而，我认为这样的处理对于该故事而言是明智之选。  
  
For me personally, even as AsuShin fan, this moment in general doesn't have to become a kiss like that, and I think a lot of people think the same. I do believe that Shinji's decision to kiss Asuka in her sleep is not a good one, regardless how much he wants it at that point, regardless how the scene in original practically screams in the beginning that it has to happen. It looks wrong, since Asuka isn't aware about this, but actually the scene in the show says much more why it is wrong. Asuka needs Shinji, but not like that at the moment. She's just a kid, just like him. She cries in her sleep for her mother, while Shinji wanted to kiss her. It shows that she too has problems and fears, even if it's in a dream, so the idea of kissing her immediately goes away, and rightly so. So usually this kind of attempt to make a kiss in this scene possible in the fics, an attempt to become a starting point for a better relationship, this kind of thing doesn't really work. Because such "fix" completely obscures the original theme of the scene and removes it as resolved. And I believe it's wrong.  
就我个人而言，即便我是 AsuShin 的粉丝，这一刻也不必演变成那样的吻，我相信很多人都有同感。我确实认为，无论真嗣当时多么渴望，无论原作中场景一开始就几乎在尖叫必须发生，真嗣决定在明日香睡着时吻她并不是一个好决定。这看起来不对，因为明日香对此并不知情，但实际上，剧中的场景说明了更多为什么这是错误的。明日香需要真嗣，但不是以这种方式，至少在那一刻不是。她和真嗣一样，只是个孩子。她在睡梦中为母亲哭泣，而真嗣却想吻她。这表明她也有问题和恐惧，即使是在梦中，所以立即吻她的想法消失了，这是正确的。 因此，通常在小说场景中尝试制造接吻机会，以此作为改善关系的起点，这种做法往往难以成功。因为这样的“修正”彻底掩盖了场景原有的主题，并错误地将其视为已解决的问题。我坚信这种做法是不妥的。  
  
But here we see Shinji makes a mistake after all and manages to kiss Asuka before she whispers the word. And I like how it's presented in the story, I like that the story shows directly and indirectly that the problems don't just go away. The tears are still there, "Mama" is still needed. Shinji still doesn't understand much and wants to run away. But perhaps it will get a little easier now, as the kiss turns out to be a pleasant surprise, even a welcome one. Two people have discovered something completely new and that warmth is intoxicating, one doesn't want to part with it once one gets used to it.  
然而在此处，我们目睹了真嗣终究还是犯了一个错误，他在明日香低语之前成功地吻了她。我欣赏故事如此呈现，它直接和间接地表明问题并不会自行消失。泪水依旧存在，“妈妈”依然被需要。真嗣仍然不太理解，想要逃避。但或许现在会稍微容易一些，因为那个吻出乎意料地令人愉快，甚至是受欢迎的。两个人发现了全新的东西，那种温暖令人陶醉，一旦习惯就不想离开。  
  
I especially loved how we saw everything from Shinji's POV and how it's shown in narration. The description of the kiss was really great, without becoming too much cliched. One particular detail is how in character Shinji and Asuka are here. I don't think Asuka could make a scene after all, she wanted some closeness when she told Shinji "something about walls". And then we see literally the core of the relationship between the characters in the image of how kiss goes. Kiss turns into bite, and it's just a perfect touch to finish classic Shinji x Asuka picture. Some blood will be shed, but love always comes with a price to pay. And such feelings and emotions will burn brighter and longer than anything. This story delivers such idea insanely well, despite not trying to focus on it. So thank you for this, and maybe you will write something more about these characters in the future.  
我尤其欣赏我们从真嗣的视角所看到的一切以及它在叙述中的呈现方式。对吻的描绘恰到好处，避免了俗套。特别值得一提的是，这里的真嗣和明日香表现得非常符合他们的角色特点。我并不认为明日香会在事后制造麻烦，她当时只是渴望与真嗣更亲近，当她提到“关于墙壁的某些事”时。随后，我们通过吻如何转变为咬的画面，深刻地揭示了角色间关系的核心。吻化为咬，这一细节完美地为经典的真嗣与明日香形象画上了点睛之笔。虽然故事并未刻意强调，但它却异常出色地传达了这样一个理念：爱情虽有代价，但其中的情感与激情将比任何事物都更加炽热和持久。 因此，感谢你为此所做的努力，或许将来你会进一步探讨这些角色的故事。

[24karatDVNO](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/15156671/24karatDVNO): Minor nitpick: Asuka in canon was actually awake the whole time she laid down next to Shinji and he attempted to kiss her.  
小细节修正：实际上，在正史里，明日香躺在真嗣旁边并被他试图亲吻时，她一直是清醒的。  
  
Nevertheless, this was a nice first chapter, short and to the point but also not skimping on details. I'll definitely be keeping my eye on this one to see what happens next.  
尽管如此，这是一个很好的初次chapter体验，简洁明了且不失细节。我一定会持续关注，期待后续的发展。

**Riley Escobar**: I really enjoyed your take on ep 9. You are absolutely correct about how the anime was about missed connections but that's what fanfic are for. 10/10 I look forward to any other Eva fanfiction you may write  
我非常欣赏你对第 9 集的见解。你关于这部动漫探讨的是错失联系的观点非常准确，而这正是同人小说的魅力所在。满分 10 分，我期待着你未来可能创作的任何 EVA 同人作品。  
  
"I throughly enjoy stories that depict shinji not acting like a punk and actually man up, where they break through Asuka's hard shell and she becomes a decent human being hell give Rei personality "  
我特别欣赏那些故事，它们展现了真嗣不再像个小混混，而是真正成长起来，他们突破了明日香坚硬的外壳，使她变得更为人性化，同时也赋予了丽鲜明的个性
