Shinji and Asuka lie on their backs on a beach. They could have been there for ten seconds or ten thousand years.  
真嗣和明日香仰躺在沙滩上。他们可能在那里躺了十秒钟，也可能躺了整整一万年。

**A/N:** wrote this impulsively after riffing in a discord server. lulz.  
A/N：在 Discord 服务器上即兴发挥后，一时兴起写下了这个。哈哈。

Shinji and Asuka lie on their backs on a beach. They could have been there for ten seconds or ten thousand years. The world is empty but for the two of them and the whisper of waves against the shore.  
真嗣和明日香躺在沙滩上，仰望着天空。时间仿佛凝固，或许是十秒，又或许已过万年。四周空无一人，唯有海浪轻柔地拍打着岸边，陪伴着他们。

Asuka dies soundlessly. Shinji's hands crush her throat. The fingers of her bandaged hand twitch once against the sand and then become still. Her body goes limp. Her remaining eye stares glassily into infinite nothing. Shinji doesn't let go. He stays on top of her until his arms give out. Then he looks at her. And looks at her. And looks at her.  
明日香无声地离世。真嗣的双手紧紧扼住她的喉咙。她那只包扎的手指在沙地上微微抽搐后便不再动弹。她的身体逐渐失去力气，瘫软下来。她仅存的那只眼睛空洞地凝视着无尽的虚空。真嗣始终没有松手，一直压在她身上，直到自己的手臂无力支撑。随后，他一遍又一遍地凝视着她。

"Asuka," he croaks, and shakes her shoulders. Her head lolls grotesquely. Her eye doesn't blink. "Oh. Oh no. Asuka. _Asuka."_  
‘明日香，’他嘶哑地呼唤，摇动她的肩膀。她的头颅无力地垂下，姿态异常。她的眼睛始终未曾眨动。‘哦，不，明日香，明日香。’

This is all wrong. This should not have happened. He retches. Vomit runs down his arms and splatters on the red plugsuit, staining it. He pushes himself up, _away,_ but his foot catches on one bony hip and sends him sprawling. When he recovers, Asuka's poor dead face is turned toward him accusingly, her corpse jostled by the violent motion. Shinji retches again.  
这一切都错了。本不该发生的。他呕吐起来。呕吐物流过他的手臂，溅在红色的插头服上，染上了污渍。他推开自己，远离这一切，但他的脚被一个瘦削的髋骨绊住，使他摔倒在地。当他恢复过来时，明日香那可怜的死脸正责备地转向他，她的尸体因剧烈的动作而摇晃。真嗣再次呕吐。

"What have I done," he whimpers. He knows the answer, though. He thinks of his mother, her hand on his cheek. He heaves. There is nothing left in his stomach to come up. There is nothing left in the whole world but him. She was looking at him.  
"我究竟做了什么？" 他哽咽道。虽然心中已有答案，但仍不禁思索。他忆起母亲，她温柔的手抚摸着他的脸颊。他深吸一口气，胃里已空无一物，再无东西可吐。整个世界仿佛只剩他一人，而她，正凝视着他。

Trembling, Shinji gets to his feet. Moonlight glitters on the horizon. Ayanami's great blind eye pierces him and emerges out the other end, spear-like. He wades into the surf. The water is cold. It doesn't stop him. His nails are digging bloody crescents into his palms. The water comes up past his waist. His teeth are chattering. He blinks.  
颤抖中，真嗣站起身。月光在海平线闪耀。绫波那巨大的盲眼犹如长矛，穿透了他，从另一端显现。他踏入海浪，水冰冷刺骨，却未曾让他止步。他的指甲深深陷入掌心，留下血淋淋的半月形痕迹。海水淹至腰际，他的牙齿因寒冷而打颤。他眨了眨眼。

Ayanami appears in front of him. She hovers above the blood-red waves, her dangling toes not quite touching them. She looks down at him. Her face is impassive. Inscrutable. He searches it almost desperately for a hint of condemnation.  
绫波出现在他面前，悬浮于血红波涛之上，脚尖轻悬，未触水面。她俯视着他，面无表情，深不可测。他近乎绝望地在她脸上寻找着一丝谴责的痕迹。

Ayanami's lips pull back to expose her teeth.  
绫波的嘴角向后扯动，露出了牙齿。

"Shinji," calls Asuka from behind him.  
"真嗣，" 明日香在他身后喊了一声。

Shinji's teeth stop chattering. His heart stops beating. He doesn't move.  
真嗣的牙齿不再打颤，心跳也停止了，他静止不动。

"Shinji," Asuka says again. Her voice carries above the sound of the water and the roar of his despair. It's high and clear, like it always was. It's devoid of anger. Devoid of irritation. She said only his name.  
"真嗣，" 明日香又一次呼唤道。她的声音穿透了水声与他的绝望之吼，依旧高亢而清澈。语气中没有愤怒，也没有不耐烦，她只是轻唤了他的名字。

He turns his head. 他扭头转向。

Asuka is standing on the shore. When she sees him looking at her she smiles, close-lipped. It's beatific. Her eye crinkles. She looks genuinely happy to see him. It's a most un-Asukalike expression. She holds out her arms.  
明日香站在海边，当她察觉到他在看她时，她露出了一个含蓄的微笑，显得神圣而美好。她的眼角因笑容而微微皱起，流露出真挚的喜悦。这种表情与她平时的样子大相径庭。她随即张开双臂，迎接他的到来。

"Come here, Shinji," she says.  
“过来，真嗣，”她招呼道。

A tremor runs through him. "I killed you," he replies.  
他浑身一颤。“我杀了你。”他答道。

Her smile widens. "You did."  
她笑得更开了。“你确实做到了。”

"So you're dead!" 这么说你已经去世了！

"I decided to come back."  
我决定返回。

"Why?!" 为什么呢？！

"Come here, Shinji, and I'll tell you."  
过来吧，真嗣，我会告诉你。

_No,_ he thinks, but his body moves of its own accord until it stands, soaked and trembling, just out of reach of the waves. Asuka walks up to him. She stops close enough that he can smell her: salt and blood and his vomit that stains her plugsuit. Her eye is filled with an alien gentleness and fixed on his. She's still smiling. There is a ring of lurid purple bruises around her neck. He remembers the first time he laid eyes on her. The yellow dress. The blue choker.  
不，他想，但他的身体不由自主地移动，直到站立，湿透且颤抖，刚好避开海浪。明日香向他走来。她停得足够近，他可以闻到她：盐、血和他吐在她驾驶服上的呕吐物。她的眼睛里充满了异样的温柔，凝视着他。她仍在微笑。她的脖子上有一圈紫色的淤青。他记得第一次见到她的情景。那条黄色裙子。那条蓝色项圈。

Her hand lifts to cradle his cheek. It's so warm.  
她抬起手，温柔地托住他的脸颊，那份温暖直抵心间。

"You are not a being who should die," she murmurs, tender as a new leaf, and kisses him.  
“你不该是个会死的存在，”她低语着，温柔如初绽的嫩叶，轻轻吻了他。

Asuka's tongue is in his mouth. Asuka's hand is in his hair. Asuka's body is pressed against his. Asuka's bandages are scraping against his face. "Let me make you happy, Shinji," she murmurs into his mouth. There's a hissing sound as the plugsuit decompresses. She grabs his hand and lifts it to herself. His fingers touch skin, warm and impossibly soft. He gasps. Tries to jerk away.  
明日香的舌头探入他的口中，她的手轻抚着他的发丝，身体紧紧相贴，绷带轻轻刮过他的脸颊。她在他唇边低语：“让我带给你快乐，真嗣。”驾驶服减压时发出细微的嘶嘶声，她握住他的手，引导他触摸自己的肌肤，那触感温暖而异常柔软。他不禁倒吸一口气，试图挣脱。

"Asuka, what are you –"  
明日香，你这是怎么了——

"Shhhh," she sighs, guiding his hand to her exposed breast. "It's okay, Shinji." She smiles again, almost mischievously, like she's letting him in on some joke, and leans towards him. "After all," she mumbles against his lips, "I was born again to meet you."  
嘘，" 她轻声叹息，将他的手引向自己裸露的胸前。"没事的，真嗣。" 她再次露出微笑，带着几分俏皮，仿佛在和他分享一个秘密，身体也向他倾斜。"毕竟，" 她贴近他的唇边低声说，"我重生就是为了与你相遇。

Shinji jerks like he's been electrocuted. He takes a breath to speak.  
真嗣猛地一颤，仿佛被电击一般，他深吸一口气，准备开口说话。

A high, blood-curdling scream shatters the quiet. Both Shinji and Asuka turn towards its source. A girl is running towards them across the sand, a naked girl with a shock of blue hair. Before Shinji can react she tears between them, still screaming, and grabs Asuka by the hair, forcing her to the ground. Then she falls upon her, limbs flailing. Blood spurts across the sand as she sinks her teeth into Asuka's arm. Her red eyes are feral, crazed. On Ayanami's dainty features, the expression is rendered almost demonic. He's never seen her face twisted like that, and it disturbs something primal deep inside him.  
一声尖锐刺耳的尖叫划破了宁静。真嗣和明日香同时转向声音的来源。一个蓝发散乱的裸体女孩正穿过沙滩向他们奔来。真嗣还没来得及反应，她已经尖叫着从两人中间冲过，猛地抓住明日香的头发，将她拽倒在地。随即，她扑向明日香，四肢疯狂挥舞。她一口咬住明日香的手臂，鲜血四溅在沙滩上。她那双血红的眼睛充满了野性和疯狂。在绫波那精致的面容上，此刻的表情近乎恶魔般狰狞。真嗣从未见过她如此扭曲的面孔，这让他内心深处涌起一股原始的不安。

"Stop it!" Shinji cries, and tears Ayanami off of Asuka with a strength he didn't know he still possessed. Ayanami whirls out of his grip and slaps him so hard he nearly falls.  
"住手！" 真嗣大喊一声，用自己都没想到的力气将绫波从明日香身边拉开。绫波挣脱他的控制，重重地扇了他一耳光，他差点摔倒。

"_HOW DARE YOU!"_ she shrieks. Then Ayanami turns towards her mutilated twin. "IS THIS SOME SORT OF SICK JOKE?!"  
“你怎么敢这样！”她尖叫起来。随后，绫波转向她那面目全非的双胞胎，怒吼道：“这是在开什么恶劣的玩笑吗？！”

The half-head on the horizon only leers in reply.  
地平线上那半颗头颅只是嘲讽地回望着。

Asuka begins to stir. Shinji hurries to her side, placing his body between her and Ayanami. "I'm sorry," he babbles to her, helplessly, "I'm so sorry, Asuka, I didn't mean to, to kill you, to hurt you, I'm sorry, I'm –"  
明日香开始有了动静。真嗣急忙赶到她身边，用自己的身体隔开她和绫波。“对不起，”他慌乱地向她道歉，显得十分无助，“真的很对不起，明日香，我不是有意要伤害你，甚至杀了你，我真的很抱歉，我——”

"Shut UP!" Ayanami screams, and then she doubles over as LCL gushes from her mouth. Shinji shuts up. He helps Asuka to her feet. Ayanami, at this point, has sunk to her knees. She looks up at them with burning eyes.  
"闭嘴！" 绫波尖叫着，随即因 LCL 从口中喷涌而弯下腰。真嗣立刻安静下来，帮助明日香站起身。此刻，绫波已经跪在地上，用炽热的目光抬头望向他们。

"Who are you," she says hoarsely, focusing on Asuka.  
“你是谁？”她嘶哑地问道，目光紧紧锁定在明日香身上。

Asuka smiles with her teeth.  
明日香展露出牙齿的微笑。

Ayanami flinches as if struck. She starts to shake. "That's not yours," Ayanami says. "That's _not yours._ Give it _back!"_  
绫波仿佛受到了打击般退缩，身体开始颤抖。她急切地说：“那不属于你，快还给我！”

She lunges for Asuka again. This time, Shinji is able to stop her. He forcefully shoves Ayanami away, so hard that she falls back down onto the sand. She stares up at him with wide, incredulous eyes.  
她再次扑向明日香，但这次真嗣及时制止了她。他用力将绫波推开，力度之大让她跌坐在沙滩上。她睁大眼睛，难以置信地望着他。

Then she bursts into tears.  
随后，她突然泪流满面。

Shinji stares down at her, dumbstruck. His heart is beating too hard. Maybe this is all some horrible dream. Maybe he's dead. Maybe this is the afterlife. Maybe this is hell.  
真嗣呆呆地低头看着她，心中悸动不已。或许这一切只是一场噩梦，又或许他已离世，眼前便是来生，抑或是地狱。

Asuka slips her hand into his, twining their fingers together.  
明日香轻轻地将手伸进他的手中，两人的手指交缠在一起。

"Asuka?" Shinji asks. 「明日香？」真嗣问道。

"Yes, Shinji?" 怎么了，真嗣？

He swallows. His jaw trembles. "What's going on?" he asks, as hot tears begin streaking down his cheeks. "Why is Ayanami…I thought she was…"  
他吞咽了一下，下巴微微颤抖。“到底怎么了？”他问道，泪水滚烫地划过脸颊。“为什么是绫波……我以为她……”

"Oh, Shinji," sighs Asuka. She squeezes his hand reassuringly and then puts her arms around him. The one that Ayanami had bitten leaks hot blood onto his shirt. Asuka doesn't seem to care. Shinji sags into Asuka's embrace, resting his head against hers.  
"哦，真嗣，"明日香叹息着说。她紧紧握住他的手以示安慰，随后展开双臂拥他入怀。被绫波咬伤的伤口流出的鲜血染红了他的衬衫，但明日香对此毫不在意。真嗣无力地靠在明日香的怀抱里，头轻轻倚在她的头上。

"Don't worry about her, okay?" Asuka says. "Ayanami's just…a little disoriented."  
别担心她，好吗？" 明日香说道，"绫波只是……有点不知所措。

Shinji looks uncertainly at the sobbing girl curled up on the sand. She's wailing like she's going to fall apart, or perhaps already has.  
真嗣不安地注视着那个蜷缩在沙滩上哭泣的女孩。她的哭声仿佛预示着即将崩溃，又或许已经支离破碎。

"Come on," Asuka murmurs into his ear. "Let's go find somewhere to rest. Don't worry, okay? I'll take care of you."  
来吧，" 明日香轻声在他耳边说，"我们去找个地方休息。别担心，好吗？我会照顾你的。

He remembers Asuka in another life, standing proudly in her black leotard, glaring into the sunset as if daring it to match her fire. Asuka stands beside him, smiling at him like he's her favorite thing in the world. He glances back at Ayanami. It still feels wrong to leave her there, but…  
他记得在另一个生命里，明日香身着黑色紧身衣，骄傲地站立，凝视着夕阳，仿佛在挑战它能否与她的热情相媲美。明日香站在他身旁，对他微笑，仿佛他是她世界中最珍爱的存在。他回头望向绫波，心中仍觉不妥，但……

"Okay, Asuka," Shinji murmurs, and together, they depart from the beach.  
"好吧，明日香，" 真嗣轻声说道，两人一同离开了海滩。

### Comment

When I read "I came back." I laughed. This is a parody.  
当我读到“我回来了。”时，我笑了。这是一篇恶搞文。

what?  
this feels too surreal  
这感觉太过超现实

**Titanking697**: Its a pretty well detailed and gripping fic for sure. The wtf moments with Asuka and Rei make me wonder why everything unfolded the way it did, but the mystery is a part of its charm as a horror fic.  
这确实是一篇细节丰富且扣人心弦的同人文。明日香和绫波的那些令人费解的时刻让我不禁思考为何事情会如此发展，但这种谜团正是作为一篇恐怖同人文的魅力所在。

[skyf0x](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/14765557/skyf0x): This story is something out of the category of short stories written in a semi-humorous manner, but which are meant to scare the hell out of you. Something on the level of nightmares, a true horrific experience. The author has really managed to exploit all the necessary triggers to evoke the whole storm of emotions inside the reader from horror to depression. And that is something to be admired.  
这篇故事属于那种半幽默风格的短篇小说，实则旨在将你吓得魂飞魄散。它如同噩梦般的存在，是一次真正的恐怖体验。作者巧妙地利用了所有必要的触发点，唤起了读者内心从恐惧到抑郁的情感风暴。这着实令人钦佩。  
  
The concept itself really feels like some kind of sick joke in the universe of the story. Something to be laughed at from the sidelines without even reading anything yet, thinking about how deliberately idiotic everything was made up. The only "problem" is that after reading it one can only cry rather than laugh. Everything is described and presented exactly in such a way that you literally can't tear yourself away from the screen. And it brings the pain because you believe in what's going on. It is literally mesmerising in its strangeness.  
这个概念本身在故事宇宙中就像是一种病态的玩笑。未读之前，旁观者或许会嗤之以鼻，认为一切都是如此刻意地愚蠢。唯一的“问题”是，读完后人们只能哭泣而非发笑。一切都被描述和呈现得如此逼真，以至于你简直无法从屏幕上移开视线。它带来的痛苦在于你深信不疑所发生的一切。这种奇异感简直令人着迷。  
  
The only moment when the illusion and immersion was interrupted was when "un-Asukalike" was used. I don't know English, and maybe it's only natural to use such made-up words in the narrative of a work of fiction, but the word seemed too casual and colloquial. It immediately caught my eye and somehow disrupted the reading experience. But maybe I'm picking on the story too much, which was just created as a joke aka shitpost.  
唯一打破幻觉与沉浸感的时刻，是当使用了“不像明日香”这个词时。我不懂英语，或许在虚构作品的叙述中使用这种自创词汇是自然而然的，但这个词显得过于随意和口语化。它立刻引起了我的注意，并在某种程度上打断了阅读体验。但也许我过于挑剔了，这篇故事本就是作为玩笑即兴创作的。  
  
In all other respects it was noticeable how the detail work was really done. Almost every one of them plays to the stated purpose of shocking and frightening the reader. And it was done in a balanced way, I think. Not too edgy and eyerolling, but edgy enough to strike an emotion within us. This was especially evident in that wonderfully terrifying plot twist halfway through the story. It just becomes doubly unbearably sad for Asuka - because she realises with her own eyes that Shinji is really interested in her. And such a dramatic moment practically breaks me down at the end too.  
在其他方面，细节处理的用心显而易见。几乎每一个情节都旨在震撼和惊吓读者。而且我认为这种处理是平衡的，既不过于尖锐和令人翻白眼，又足够尖锐以触动我们的情感。这一点在故事中途那个精彩绝伦的恐怖转折中尤为明显。对明日香来说，这变得双倍难以忍受的悲伤——因为她亲眼意识到真嗣真的对她感兴趣。这样一个戏剧性的时刻几乎在结尾处也让我崩溃。  
  
Although it sounds super tempting to try to continue with this concept, I think it would only ruin everything. In the long run it will just turn into another weird story that is angsty on purpose, and that just drags it all out, mocking the character, making it even more miserable. If you think about it seriously, the story will just touch on some very strange topics, and it doesn't make literal or meta sense, given that this is Post-EoE. Neither Asuka nor Shinji deserve it. A sequel would just make this fic lose all its charm. This story will just stop being special scary tale. The goal here has already been achieved and where is nothing to add anymore.  
尽管继续这个概念听起来非常诱人，但我认为这只会毁了一切。长远来看，它只会变成另一个刻意制造悲伤的奇怪故事，拖沓冗长，嘲弄角色，使其更加悲惨。认真思考一下，这个故事只会触及一些非常奇怪的主题，而且在字面意义或元意义上都不合理，毕竟这是《EoE》之后的作品。无论是明日香还是真嗣，都不应该遭受这些。续集只会让这篇同人失去所有的魅力。这个故事将不再是一个特别的恐怖故事。目标已经达成，没有什么可再添加的了。  
  
I still think a couple of tags should have been removed for completeness to surprise the reader even more. But I appreciate the "no baiting allowed" approach. It's a fine horror tragedy and it should stay that way, in this form. Thanks for this work, I hate it. Don't pull Kadmon on us anymore, the real one is enough, I believe.  
我仍然认为为了更出乎读者意料，应该移除几个标签以保持完整性。但我欣赏“不允许诱饵”的做法。这是一部优秀的恐怖悲剧，应该保持这种形式。感谢这部作品，我讨厌它。不要再对我们使用卡德蒙了，真实的已经足够，我相信。

[Pinecone277](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/15225086/Pinecone277): I can say with certainty that this is one of the things I have read. Truly one of the fanfictions ever.  
我可以肯定地说，这是我读过的作品之一。确实是迄今为止的同人文佳作。  
  
It is hard to put into words how I feel about this. On one hand, what the fuck. On the other, your prose and writing style make this very enjoyable to read. Which loops right around to me asking what the fuck.  
很难用言语表达我对这作品的感受。一方面，这到底是什么鬼。另一方面，你的文笔和写作风格让阅读变得非常愉快。这又让我回到了那个问题：这到底是什么鬼。  
  
Please continue this lmao  
请继续更新，哈哈

[deathbringer374](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1166503/deathbringer374): I don't understand why I read this.  
我不明白为什么我会读这个。  
  
Probably never will. Things happen in this fic that I suggested, and by golly by jingo do I regret it. Regardless, well, your prose and writing quality are already miles above my own. So kudos on that, and may God have mercy on your soul.  
可能永远也不会明白。这篇同人中发生的事情是我建议的，天哪，我真后悔。尽管如此，你的文笔和写作质量已经远超我之上。所以在这方面给你点赞，愿上帝怜悯你的灵魂。  
  
Remember to stay healthy, do cardio and eat your veggies!  
记得保持健康，做有氧运动，多吃蔬菜！  
  
PEACE.

[Romulo Nidoking BR](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/109777/Romulo-Nidoking-BR): Hey.  
A nice concept of an horror/tragedy story in Kadmon style. Good writing here, as you wrote this in the way that let's the reader understand what is going on and making it even more terrifying.  
这是一部以卡德蒙风格呈现的恐怖/悲剧故事的好概念。文笔出色，你以一种让读者理解正在发生什么的方式写作，使其更加恐怖。  
  
Like I told you, this story - even it's intended to be something crack and a one shot thing - has potential for a great drama and a longer, more developed story.  
正如我之前告诉你的，这个故事——尽管它旨在成为一种裂缝文学和短篇小说——有潜力发展成一部伟大的戏剧和更长、更成熟的故事。  
  
It's kinda a continuation from the instrumentality. Asuka was right after all? Shinji just wanted her body and a doll to submit to his desires? Well, Shinji can get it now with Kaworu inside her body. And what Asuka inside Rei - which she despises - will do seeing Kaworu in her former body getting with Shinji by "being nice to him", just like he asked her and she denied?  
这算是从人类补完计划后的延续吧。毕竟，明日香终究是对的？碇真嗣只是想要她的身体和一个顺从他欲望的玩偶？好吧，现在他可以通过在明日香体内的渚薰得到这一切。而明日香在绫波体内的她所厌恶的存在，看到渚薰在她曾经的身体里与碇真嗣亲热，就像他要求她那样‘对他好’，而她拒绝了，她会作何反应呢？  
  
So many nice ways to go from here. Don't know if you will continue this, but it would be interesting if you decide to do it. Thanks for writing.  
从这里开始有很多精彩的发展方向。不知道你是否会继续这个故事，但如果你决定继续，那一定会很有趣。感谢你的创作。
