So in the series, Asuka doesn't appear to like Shinji all that much. She's pretty abrasive towards him, and overall not very nice.  
所以在剧中，明日香似乎并不怎么喜欢真嗣。她对他相当刻薄，总的来说不太友善。

Lately, I've been wondering how far she would go to hurt him. There was that kitchen scene in EOE, though it's uncertain if that was really Asuka or some projection in Shinji's mind. There was also that fan fiction Scar Tissue where Asuka had Shinji sent to the hospital after beating him severely. I'm not so certain if that's something she would really do or not.  
最近，我一直在想她会为了伤害他做到什么程度。在《EOE》中有那个厨房场景，尽管不确定那究竟是真正的明日香还是真嗣心中的投影。还有那篇同人小说《伤痕累累》，其中明日香把真嗣打得严重到送医院。我不太确定这是否是她真的会做的事情。

[Real_Ad_8243](https://www.reddit.com/user/Real_Ad_8243/): The thing here, is that Scar Tissue is a fanfic. It's exploring certain themes and using the eva pilots to do so, but Asuka's behaviour in ST isn't actually anything to do with Asuka, anymore than her being openly loving is in A&T. They're both unrealistic in their own ways considering rhe characters at the heart of the story.  
这里的关键是，《伤痕》是一篇同人小说。它在探讨某些主题并利用 EVA 驾驶员来实现这一点，但《伤痕》中明日香的行为实际上与明日香本人无关，正如《A&T》中她公开示爱一样不真实。考虑到故事核心的角色，两者都有其不真实之处。

Asuka is very traumatised by her past, and it's only exacerbated by her being used as a disposable weapon by the people who are supposed to care for her. She's quite blatantly interested in Shinji but her clumsy attempts at expressing this but up against his own issues and all this piles up on her own fragility, so she lashes out (verbally for the most part).  
明日香深受过去创伤的影响，而她被那些本应关心她的人当作一次性武器使用，这只会加剧她的痛苦。她对真嗣明显有好感，但她在表达这种感情时的笨拙尝试遭遇了真嗣自身的问题，这一切都堆积在她自身的脆弱上，因此她会（大多以言语上）爆发。

We see her act as a bit of a bully in the show early on, but the nature of the behaviour changes from that to a response to the emotional pain inflicted upon her (and, frankly, outside of the comic gags of overblown stuff that was a trope of 90's anime anyway, she isn't physically violent with Shinji at all iirc)- this is part of the core dynamic of her relationship with Shinji; they're both traumatised, broken people, who could help eachother if they were able to communicate properly, but the failure to do that leads them in to despair.  
在剧中早期，我们看到她表现得有点像个小霸王，但这种行为本质从最初的欺凌转变为对施加在她身上的情感痛苦的回应（而且，坦白说，除了那些夸张的搞笑桥段，这些在 90 年代动漫中本就是一种套路，我记得她并没有对真嗣实施任何身体暴力）——这是她和真嗣关系的核心动态的一部分；他们都是受过创伤、心灵破碎的人，如果能好好沟通，本可以互相帮助，但沟通失败却让他们陷入了绝望。

But that despair and that failure to communicate is resolved in ep.25/6 and EoE by Instrumentality. Beyond that, finally understanding eachothers feelings and perspective, they can begin to heal.  
但这种绝望和沟通失败在第 25/6 集和 EoE 中通过人类补完计划得到了解决。超越了这一点，最终理解了彼此的感受和视角，他们才能开始疗愈。

[MissAlice_17](https://www.reddit.com/user/MissAlice_17/): Their relationship is misunderstood. It’s a product of 2 people wanting to connect to each other but in doing so would get hurth in the process (Hedgehog’s Dilemma). It’s the overarching theme of evangelion angels and mythology aside. Please rewatch evangelion again and try to analyze their relationship closer. You’re only examples is a fanfic (not canon) and the way Asuka hurt Shinji in EoE. There’s more to this than just that. Yes on the surface it’s a toxic, and somehow abusive relationship, but it’s 2 people or are severely emotionally damaged and traumatized, reaching puberty (wanting physical touch) but ultimately 2 poor souls who struggle to connect. They’re complete opposites, shinji took on the depressed path to shield himself from the world while Asuka used her pride and liveliness to do the same thing but in the end they both just want the same thing. Asuka wouldn’t want to hurt Shinji when it all comes to the end, when all their dilemmas are stripped away. Hence the carress on Shinji’s face in EoE
他们的关系被误解了。这是两个人渴望相互连接的结果，但在这个过程中会受到伤害（刺猬困境）。这是《新世纪福音战士》中天使和神话之外的总体主题。请重新观看《新世纪福音战士》并尝试更深入地分析他们的关系。你提到的例子只是一篇同人小说（非正典）以及《真心为你》中明日香伤害真嗣的情节。这背后还有更多。是的，表面上这是一种有毒的，甚至有些虐待的关系，但这是两个严重情感受损和受创、进入青春期（渴望身体接触）的人，最终是两个努力连接的可怜灵魂。他们是完全相反的，真嗣选择了抑郁的道路来保护自己免受世界的伤害，而明日香则用她的骄傲和活力做同样的事情，但最终他们都想要同样的东西。当所有困境都被剥离时，明日香不会想伤害真嗣。因此，在《真心为你》中她抚摸真嗣的脸颊。

[NarutoUchihaX14](https://www.reddit.com/user/NarutoUchihaX14/): Not any further than what she's done in the series....if I remember right Scar Tissue is post 3I? So there can be certain liberties taken there considering what they both go thru in EoE. I digress, most of Asuka's are her extreme coping mechanisms. Shinji would really only ever be in legit harm if it were a situation like she had like woken up in the hospital scene in EoE... As far as the kitchen scene, I'd like to think that was her, but only because she wasn't exactly wrong.  
不会比她在剧集中所做的更进一步……如果我没记错的话，《伤痕累累》是第 3I 话之后的？所以考虑到他们在《EoE》中经历的一切，那里可以有一些自由发挥。我离题了，大多数情况下，明日香的行为是她极端的应对机制。真嗣只有在类似她在《EoE》中醒来在医院场景的情况下才会真正受到伤害……至于厨房场景，我倾向于认为是她，只是因为她并非完全无理。

[BlazingNightmare](https://www.reddit.com/user/BlazingNightmare/):Scar Tissue it's a FANFIC, therefore not canon. That being said, I suggest you to read it by yourself, because it is _completely_ Asushin. From the beginning til the end.  
《伤痕累累》是一篇同人小说，因此不是正统。尽管如此，我建议你自己阅读，因为它从头到尾都是明日香和真嗣的故事。

As for the show... you clearly have _zero_ understanding of Asuka and Shinji's relationship, no offense.  
至于这部剧...你显然对明日香和真嗣的关系一无所知，无意冒犯。

The answer to your question is: _Asuka wouldn't try to hurt him_. Asuka never tried to hurt him for real. She being mean is just Anno overexploiting one of the many common tropes in anime rom-coms (the Tsundere girl), as he does with some other common tropes in anime throughout the show.  
你问题的答案是：明日香不会试图伤害他。明日香从未真正试图伤害他。她表现得刻薄只是庵野秀明过度利用了动漫浪漫喜剧中的常见套路（傲娇女孩），就像他在整部剧中对其他一些常见动漫套路所做的那样。

To say that """Asuka hates Shinji and tries to hurt him""" is not only a big misunderstanding, but a minimization their relationship and of her character.  
说‘‘明日香讨厌真嗣并试图伤害他’’不仅是极大的误解，还是对他们关系及她个性的轻视。

Asuka isn't trying to hurt Shinji. Asuka is a broken, 14 year-old girl, who grew up without any form of love (no mother, no father), and with the trauma of seeing her own mother replace her with a doll, and commit suicide, therefore doesn't know how to accept and to express her feelings like a normal person would know. Instead, she turns all that fear and insecurities into anger. She also hates herself for liking a boy of her age, which she sees as an obstacle in her lifeplan of "not relying on anyone", and who is as broken down as she is, maybe even more. This situation leads her to suffer and to get angry due to her own obsession with being a mature adult (again, conditioned by her childhood trauma), but as we see near the end of the show and in EoE, all she actually wants is comprehension and human affection, which is something Shinji can give her after EoE, after they learn to accept yourself each other, and their feelings for each other, in that apocalyptic beach.  
明日香并非有意伤害真嗣。她是一个破碎的 14 岁女孩，成长过程中缺乏任何形式的爱（没有母亲，没有父亲），并承受着目睹母亲用一个玩偶取代自己后自杀的创伤，因此她不知道如何像正常人那样接受和表达情感。相反，她将所有恐惧和不安全感转化为愤怒。她自己也讨厌喜欢上一个同龄男孩，这在她‘‘不依赖任何人’’的生活计划中被视为障碍，而这个男孩同样破碎，甚至可能比她还严重。这种情况导致她因自己对成熟成人的执着（再次受童年创伤影响）而痛苦和愤怒，但正如我们在剧集接近尾声和 EoE 中看到的，她真正渴望的是理解和人类的关爱，这是真嗣在 EoE 后，在他们学会接受彼此及彼此的情感后，能在那末日海滩上给予她的。
	Yes, I'm fully aware of that. And yes, I have read it (though I haven't been keeping up with the latest chapters lately. It's been a while since I've read it, and I have already been through several chapters or so.). That being said, I think her treatment towards him, to me, is somewhat believable. At least, pretty damn convincing. And she tried to make things right between her and Shinji after that incident at the beginning of it.  
	是的，我完全清楚这一点。而且是的，我读过它（尽管我最近没有跟上最新的章节。我已经有一段时间没读了，而且我已经读了好几章）。话虽如此，我认为她对他的态度，对我来说，是有些可信的。至少，相当有说服力。而且在那起事件开始后，她试图修复她和真嗣之间的关系。
