### Chapter 1

Ok... well, as usual, when I started writing, this exploded.  
好吧...嗯，像往常一样，当我开始写作时，这东西就爆炸了。  
Discord chat, largely with Alex , gave me the idea to do a crack-mashup of Evangelion and The Hangover. Predictably, the results are also shot through with WAFF, because well... Me.  
与 Alex 在 Discord 上的聊天启发了我，让我想做一个《新世纪福音战士》和《宿醉》的疯狂混搭。不出所料，结果中也充满了温馨感人的片段，毕竟...是我嘛。

It's also hit 5k before I've gotten them out of the hotel room.  
而且，在我让他们离开酒店房间之前，字数就已经突破了 5 千。  
So, here's Part 1 of ? of Evangelion: The Hangover. This may or may not be mixed with A&T writing as I go forward.  
那么，这是《新世纪福音战士：宿醉》的第 1 部分，共？部分。随着故事的推进，可能会融入 A&T 的写作风格。  
To be clear, this is _not_ A&T's universe. This is early 2021, 3rd Impact never came, and SEELE and Gendo are no longer worries. Exactly how that happened may or may not come up in the story, but for now, just count them as dead or gone.  
明确一下，这里并非 A&T 的世界。这是 2021 年初，第三次冲击从未发生，SEELE 和碇源堂也不再是问题。具体他们是如何消失的，故事中可能会提及也可能不会，但目前只需将他们视为已死或已离去。  
And yes, that means everyone is old enough for what happens here.  
没错，这意味着所有人在这里都已足够成熟，能够应对发生的事情。

.

What happens in Vegas... 在拉斯维加斯发生的事...

Shinji Ikari woke up, and immediately regretted it. His head hurt. A lot. His stomach hurt. A lot. His arms and legs felt too heavy to move. And hurt. A lot. He didn't feel like a 20 year old man who'd just woken up from a deep sleep. He felt like a 200 year old man whose body was in revolt. He was tired and worn out, like he'd been running or exercising all night, and some strategic bits of him felt kind of sore like he'd been mas-...um… 'being introspective' all night.  
碇真嗣醒来，立刻就后悔了。他的头很痛。非常痛。他的胃也很痛。非常痛。他的四肢沉重得无法动弹。而且也很痛。非常痛。他感觉自己不像是一个刚从深度睡眠中醒来的 20 岁青年。他感觉自己像是一个身体正在反抗的 200 岁老人。他疲惫不堪，仿佛整夜都在奔跑或锻炼，某些关键部位还有些酸痛，好像他整夜都在自省……嗯……'进行内省'。

He almost hurt too much to move. His limbs felt so heavy... and kind of lumpy? Wait…  
他几乎痛得动弹不得。他的四肢感觉如此沉重……而且有点肿胀？等等……

With great effort, he pried his gluey eyes open, just a slit. The weak sunlight dribbling in between the curtains on the hotel suite's windows _still_ hurt his eyes. But not nearly as much as how much the sight that greeted them made his brain hurt and his heart clench.  
他费了很大劲才勉强将黏糊糊的眼皮撑开一条缝。透过酒店套房窗帘缝隙洒进来的微弱阳光依旧刺痛了他的眼睛。但远不及眼前所见之景给他带来的心痛和脑部冲击来得强烈。

Asuka Langley Soryu was right in his face.  
明日香·兰格雷就紧贴在他面前。

To be fair, she was achingly beautiful, as always. She'd been beautiful at 14, and now at 20 she was a true heartbreaker. What made his heart clench right now was how cute she was in her sleep… ten centimeters from his face. And how she was wrapped around him like he was her body pillow at home, the one she pretended was just for her comfort, not because she nuzzled it in her sleep and sometimes mumbled sweetly to it…. Not that he'd ever peeked into her room while he tried to work up the nerve to go in and talk to her!  
平心而论，她一如既往地令人心碎地美丽。十四岁时她就很美，如今二十岁的她更是名副其实的倾城佳人。此刻令他心痛的是她熟睡中的可爱模样……离他的脸只有十厘米。而且她像抱着家里的抱枕一样紧紧缠绕着他，那个她假装只是为了舒适而非因为她在睡梦中会依偎并偶尔对它甜蜜低语的抱枕……并非他曾鼓起勇气试图进入她的房间时偷看过！

Where was he? Oh, right, waking up in bed in a hotel with Asuka wrapped around him, no memory of how they'd ended up there, and, key point here, not a stitch of clothing on either of them. The killer hangover at least accounted for why he couldn't remember anything, though the circumstances of waking up with one of the people he was involved in a serious, long-term, maximum-awkward mutual crush-occasional-friendship-with-benefits-something made getting some answers on that front _kind of a priority._  
他在哪儿？哦，对了，在酒店的床上醒来，被明日香紧紧抱着，完全不记得他们是怎么到那儿的，而且，关键在于，两人身上一丝不挂。宿醉至少解释了为什么他什么都不记得，但醒来时身边是那个与他有着严肃、长期、极度尴尬的相互暗恋-偶尔友谊-带点好处的关系的人，这让弄清楚这一点变得相当紧迫。

On the other hand, waking up naked in bed with a girl you've literally dreamed about doing something like that with for years did lend itself to another obvious possible answer.  
另一方面，醒来时和一个你多年来实际上梦寐以求能和她发生这种事的女孩赤裸裸地躺在床上，确实提供了另一种显而易见的答案。

"Ah," Shinji muttered. "I'm having _that_ dream again."  
“啊，”真嗣喃喃自语，“我又在做那个梦了。”

His tiny utterance received a "Murrghph," of acknowledgement from his other side.  
他微弱的嘟囔换来了身旁一声含糊的“嗯”作为回应。

He blinked, and rolled his head to the right. A very familiar mop of blue hair greeted him.  
他眨了眨眼，将头转向右侧。一簇熟悉的蓝色发丝映入眼帘。

Rei Ayanami was glomped to his right arm just as firmly as Asuka was on his left. No wonder he couldn't move his limbs.  
在他的右臂上，绫波零同样紧紧地依偎着，就像左臂上的明日香一样。难怪他动弹不得。

"Oh, it's one of _those dreams," Shinji amended, still at whisper-levels of volume. Even in a nice dream, it was only considerate to not wake people, especially when they were as cute as Rei and Asuka._  
“哦，这是那种梦啊。”真嗣轻声修正道，音量依旧保持在耳语级别。即便是在美好的梦境中，不打扰他人也是基本的礼貌，尤其是当她们像绫波和明日香那样可爱时。

"Grumphlble," agreed another dreamer from across Shinji's legs.  
“咕噜姆布尔，”另一个梦者从真嗣腿的另一边附和道。

Shinji very carefully and slowly raised his head to look down his body. A sleepy and contented-looking Kaworu Nagisa was somehow peacefully sleeping laid across his and Rei's legs, his head in Rei's lap. He too somehow contrived to look really cute. Seriously, Kaworu's hair was just so silky and fluffy, it was a joy to run his fingers through and where the Hell had that come from, Shinji?  
真嗣小心翼翼地缓缓抬起头，目光顺着身体向下看去。睡眼惺忪、一脸满足的渚薰不知怎地安详地躺在他和绫波的腿上，头枕在绫波的膝间。他那副模样也莫名显得十分可爱。说真的，渚薰的头发真是丝滑又蓬松，让人忍不住想用手指去抚摸，这念头究竟是从哪儿冒出来的，真嗣？

Oh, right, that party six months ago.  
哦，对了，那场六个月前的派对。

_"Do it! Do it! Hahahah, bet you'll chicken out!" Asuka drunkenly cheered.  
"快做！快做！哈哈哈，我打赌你不敢！" 明日香醉醺醺地起哄道。_

_"It's ok if you don't want to, Shinji-kun," Kaworu said, blushing almost as hard as Shinji.  
"如果你不想做也没关系，真嗣君，" 渚薰说道，脸红得几乎和真嗣一样厉害。_

_"Nuh-uh!" Shinji slurred. "Asuka thinks I won't, and you're cute and nice and I've kind of been thinking about it for a while and Asuka once dared me to kiss her and I did and we both liked it so she can't say anything and fuck I talk too much. Come 'ere." Shinji grabbed Kaworu, pulled him into a hug, and planted a nice, solid kiss right on the Nephilim's soft lips.  
"不不！" 真嗣含糊地说道，"明日香觉得我不敢，但你又可爱又善良，我其实已经想了很久，而且明日香有一次激我吻她，我照做了，我们俩都很喜欢，所以她没资格说什么，操，我说得太多了。过来。" 真嗣抓住渚薰，把他拉进怀里，结结实实地在天使柔软的唇上吻了一下。_

_Asuka's drunken cheer of approval was barely heard. Shinji couldn't stop himself from running his hands through Kaworu's delightfully silky hair, pressing him close. He only felt even more excited when Kaworu responded to Shinji's other hand sliding south to get a nice firm grip on Kaworu's perfect backside by matching Shinji's move with his own.  
明日香醉醺醺的欢呼声几乎听不见。真嗣情不自禁地用手抚摸着渚薰那令人愉悦的丝滑头发，将他紧紧抱住。当渚薰回应真嗣另一只手向下滑去，紧紧抓住他完美的臀部时，真嗣感到更加兴奋，渚薰也以同样的动作回应。_

_Things escalated slightly. Then some more. When they finally broke apart, both of them had their shirts half-off, their pants unbuttoned, and a slightly wild look in their eyes. Shinji reluctantly pulled his hand out of Kaworu's boxers.  
事情逐渐升级，再升级。当他们最终分开时，两人的衬衫都半敞着，裤子扣子解开，眼中闪烁着些许狂野的光芒。真嗣恋恋不舍地从薰的内裤里抽出手来。_

_"Oh my fucking Gott, that was so hot," Asuka cheered. "I have never been so happy to be wrong! This is the best 20th birthday ever!"  
"哦我的天哪，真是太刺激了，"明日香欢呼道，"我从没这么高兴自己错了！这真是我有史以来最棒的 20 岁生日！"_

_"Do it again," Rei commented, quietly but with a hungry, focused look in her eyes. Rei always got strangely intense when drunk. Her verbal filters tended to evaporate, too. "I wish to see more of that."  
"再来一次，"丽评论道，声音虽轻，眼中却闪烁着饥渴而专注的光芒。丽一喝酒就会变得异常专注。她的言辞过滤器也往往随之消失。"我想多看看那个。"_

_Kaworu wobbled a bit on his feet. Drink always hit him pretty hard, though he never was anything less than cheerful. He just got… cuddly. "Not...not that I… dun wanna, but… I thought…" He hiccuped. "I thought you and Shhhhhinji were kind of a thing again. Or waszh that last month?"  
渚薰脚步有些踉跄。酒精总是让他反应强烈，尽管他从未失去过那份欢快。只是变得...格外亲昵。“不是...不是说我...不想，但是...我以为...”他打了个嗝。“我以为你和真嗣又有点什么了。还是说那是上个月的事？”_

_"Because guy-on-guy is HOT!" Asuka and Rei said in stereo. "Just like guys like watching girls make out, right?" Asuka continued. "Like this!" She grabbed an entirely unresisting Rei and gave her a kiss. Technically just one, but it went on for a while. Eventually, she had to somewhat pry Rei off her. "Sheee? And I'm mad at Shinji again thiz week, but this is a great way for making me happy with him again. So make with the yaoi action again!"  
“因为男男互动超火辣的！”明日香和丽齐声说道。“就像男生喜欢看女生亲热一样，对吧？”明日香接着说。“就像这样！”她抓住毫无反抗的丽，给了她一个吻。严格来说只是一次，但持续了相当久。最终，她不得不稍微把丽从自己身上拉开。“这样啊？我这周又对真嗣生气了，但这种方式能让我再次对他感到开心。所以再来点耽美动作吧！”_

_Shinji found he had no real objection to kissing Kaworu some more. His on-again-off-again semi-girlfriend said it was ok, and Kaworu_ _**was**_ _really cute and a good friend._ _And_ _**fuck**__, was he a good kisser!_  
碇真嗣发现自己并不真正反对与渚薰多亲吻几次。他那时而亲近时而疏远的半女友说这没问题，而且渚薰真的很可爱，是个好朋友。而且，该死，他吻技真棒！

Still, them all ending up in bed _at once_ was more likely a dream than anything. Seriously, the only time Shinji was _that_ ambitious was in his dreams. And hadn't he had the foursome one the night before they left on...that… trip? "Where are… oh, right. Misato's conference thing. Vegas," Shinji finally remembered.  
尽管如此，他们同时躺在一张床上更像是梦境而非现实。说真的，真嗣只有在梦里才会如此雄心勃勃。而且，在他们出发去...那次...旅行前一晚，他不就梦到了四人同床的情景吗？“他们在哪儿...哦，对了。美里参加的那个会议。在拉斯维加斯。”真嗣终于想起来了。

They were in Vegas. This was Caesar's Palace. He remembered checking in… yesterday? Misato had dragged them all to some 'Retrospectives on the Angel War' conference, declaring she wasn't going to let the five of them dodge it anymore, now that they were all legally of age. Asuka had used that excuse to get them out of a lot of Angel War stuff, once she'd gotten tired of the initial year of publicity.  
他们在拉斯维加斯。这里是凯撒宫。他记得昨天办理了入住……？美里硬拉着他们参加了某个“天使战争回顾”会议，宣称再也不会让他们五个逃避了，毕竟现在他们都已成年。明日香曾用这个借口逃避了许多与天使战争相关的事务，自从她厌倦了最初一年的宣传活动后。

Wait.

Vegas. All in bed together. Not wearing anything. Couldn't remember last night. The only thing that was needed to complete the bad joke was…  
拉斯维加斯。全都躺在一张床上。一丝不挂。记不清昨晚发生了什么。唯一缺的就是……

Shinji looked down at his left hand, just barely visible between him and Asuka.  
碇真嗣低头看向自己的左手，它在他和明日香之间若隐若现。

There was a nice, fairly fancy band of gold and diamond on it.  
上面有一枚漂亮且颇为精致的黄金钻石戒指。

And on Asuka's. 还有明日香的那枚。

And on Rei's. 还有丽的那份。

….and on Kaworu's. ……还有渚薰的。

"...oh. Shit," Shinji said.  
"“……哦。该死，”真嗣说道。”

Ok. Ok. Don't panic, Shinji. There had to be a logical explanation for this. The pounding headache and full bladder suggested maybe this wasn't a dream. The rings they were all wearing did too, since not even his wildest dreams included marrying all of them. So… ok, try to wake them up one at a time, to avoid mass panic.  
好了，好了，别慌，真嗣。这肯定有个合乎逻辑的解释。剧烈的头痛和胀满的膀胱暗示这可能不是梦。他们手上戴的戒指也是，因为即便在他最疯狂的梦里，也不曾想过要娶她们所有人。所以……好吧，试着一个一个叫醒她们，以免引起集体恐慌。

"Kaworu!" he hissed. Kaworu was usually cheerful and sensible, right? He was a good one to wake first.  
"卡沃鲁！" 他低声唤道。卡沃鲁通常既开朗又理智，对吧？他是最适合第一个叫醒的人。

"Mmmurble," Kaworu replied, nuzzling his face deeper into Rei's lap. Rei did not seem to mind.  
“嗯嗯呜噜，”渚薰回答道，将脸更深地埋进绫波的膝间。绫波似乎并不介意。

"Kaworu! Wake _up_!" Shinji said a little louder.  
"薰！醒醒！" 真嗣稍微提高了声音说道。

Kaworu's eyes snapped open. He vaguely focused in on Shinji, and started to smile.  
渚薰的双眼猛地睁开。他朦胧地聚焦在真嗣身上，随即露出了微笑。

Then his face turned green, and he murmured, "Oh Gott…" before leaping out of the bed and streaking for the bathroom. Sounds of extensive, deep vomiting began.  
随后他的脸色变得苍白，喃喃自语道：“哦，天哪……”紧接着从床上跳起，直奔浴室。随即传来一阵剧烈而深沉的呕吐声。

Shinji sighed. Ok, so much for plan A. Plan B.  
真嗣叹了口气。好吧，A 计划算是泡汤了。启动 B 计划。

"Rei!" Shinji tried wiggling his right arm. "Rei, wake up! We've got a situation!"  
"绫波！" 真嗣试图扭动他的右臂。"绫波，醒醒！我们有麻烦了！"

"Whuh?" Rei mumbled, cracking one crimson eye open. She smiled sleepily. "Oh, hi Shinji." She ducked her head forward to kiss him.  
"嗯？" 丽咕哝着，睁开一只深红色的眼睛。她困倦地笑了笑，"哦，嗨，真嗣。" 她向前低头，轻轻吻了他。

Shinji found himself helplessly returning the kiss. Rei was always sweet and fun to kiss. They'd intermittently dated for a few months during one of his and Asuka's 'off' times. It had more or less ended when at yet another liquor-fueled party Rei had literally pushed him into Asuka's arms, saying 'She looks sad. You make her smile.' Rei had then sat back and beamed at them while he and Asuka sucked face for the rest of the night.  
真嗣发现自己不由自主地回应了那个吻。丽总是那么甜美，吻她总是乐趣无穷。在他们和明日香某段“分手”期间，他和丽断断续续地约会了几个月。这段关系差不多在又一次酒精助兴的派对上结束了，当时丽直接把他推到了明日香怀里，说：“她看起来很难过。你去让她笑吧。”然后丽就坐在一旁，微笑着看他和明日香整晚亲热。

"Rei-mmmwha. I mean, Rei, stop! We… I think we…" he swallowed. "Umm… do you remember anything about last night?"  
"丽-嗯唔。我是说，丽，停下！我们…我觉得我们…" 他咽了咽口水。"呃…你还记得昨晚的事吗？"

Rei closed her eyes and snuggled back down, smiling contentedly. "Not really."  
丽闭上眼睛，满足地微笑着，又蜷缩回去。“并没有。”

"I...I think we got married."  
"我...我想我们结婚了。"

Rei opened one eye again. "Which? Us? You and Asuka? About time..." she said sleepily.  
丽再次睁开一只眼睛。“哪个？我们？你和明日香？终于..."她睡意朦胧地说。

"All of us." “我们所有人。”

"Oh." Rei closed her eye again. "That's nice." She yawned, and started to snore softly.  
“哦。”丽再次闭上了眼睛。“那挺好的。”她打了个哈欠，开始轻轻地打起鼾来。

Shinji wished his hand was free so he could facepalm. "Big help you are, Rei…"  
真嗣真希望自己空出一只手来捂脸。“你可真帮了大忙啊，绫波……”

Ok, plan B no good either. Plan C was to chew his arm off so he could make his escape, since plan D, 'wake up Asuka and explain this' was much scarier.  
好吧，计划 B 也不行。计划 C 是咬断自己的手臂以便逃脱，因为计划 D，“叫醒明日香并解释这一切”，要可怕得多。

...He couldn't reach his arm with his teeth without waking her. Crap. Plan C was out.  
...他无法在不吵醒她的情况下用牙齿够到自己的手臂。该死。C 计划泡汤了。

_'Oh come on, Shinji. Is it_ _**really** so scary to wake up the woman you've kind of been in love with for five years and tell her you all are now married somehow? You've had this dream too!'_  
“哎呀，真嗣，不就是叫醒你暗恋了五年的女人，告诉她你们现在莫名其妙结婚了嘛，有那么可怕吗？你也做过这个梦的！”

_'Not when I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED! Also, I doubt she'll be too ecstatic when I mention 'Rei and Kaworu too', will she?!''  
'在我连发生了什么都记不起来的时候，怎么可能冷静！而且，我要是提到“丽和薰也”，她大概也不会太高兴吧，不是吗？！'_

_'Ok, fair point. Counter-point: She_ _looks_ _**really**_ _cute and happy right now.'_  
好吧，说得有理。反驳一下：她现在看起来真的很可爱又开心。

Shinji gave up arguing with his brain. It never worked anyway. He looked down at Asuka. Alright, yeah, she _did_ look amazingly cute and happy. She always did when they woke up together, something that to be fair happened moderately often over the last few years. But no matter how often, one of them would say or do something stupid, or one of their insecurities would rear its head, and they'd break up again.  
碇真嗣放弃了与自己的大脑争论，反正这从来都没用。他低头看着明日香，好吧，没错，她的确看起来异常可爱和开心。每当他们一起醒来时，她总是这样，公平地说，这种情况在过去几年里相当频繁地发生。但无论多么频繁，总会有一个人说出或做出愚蠢的事情，或者他们中的某个人内心的不安会再次浮现，然后他们又会分手。

Then again, since they'd been living together for five years, and got back together as often as they broke up, it was more like they'd been dating for five years, with occasional 'I'm not talking to you because I'm angry' periods.  
不过话说回来，既然他们已经同居了五年，且复合的次数和分手一样频繁，这更像是一场持续了五年的恋爱，期间偶尔穿插着“我生气了，不想和你说话”的阶段。

He still loved her. That was the annoying part. No matter what they did or said to each other, he couldn't stop loving her. For all the arguments, when she was sweet, it was… like nothing else in the world. At such times, he could _almost_ understand his father's willingness to break the world to get his own love back.  
他依然爱着她。这才是最恼人的部分。无论他们彼此间做了什么或说了什么，他都无法停止对她的爱。尽管争吵不断，但当她温柔时，那种感觉……仿佛世间万物都黯然失色。在那些时刻，他几乎能理解父亲为了找回自己的爱愿意打破整个世界的决心。

Of course, then he'd remember his father was a giant asshole who'd been party to a conspiracy to kill three billion people, and out _that_ moment of sympathy went.  
当然，紧接着他就会想起他父亲是个大混蛋，参与了一场谋杀三十亿人的阴谋，那一刻的同情心也就烟消云散了。

Anyhow, Asuka. Smiling, sleeping in his arms. A really nice wakeup, except for the part where he had to explain the rings they were all wearing.  
无论如何，明日香。微笑着，在他怀里安睡。真是个美好的清晨，除了他不得不解释他们所有人手上戴的戒指那部分。

He took a deep breath. "Asuka?"  
他深吸了一口气。“明日香？”

"Mmmm?" “嗯？”

"I need you to wake up."  
"我需要你醒来。"

"Dun wanna. Headache. Hangover. Fuck. Why did we drink so much?"  
不想动。头疼。宿醉。该死。我们干嘛喝这么多？

"Do you remember last night?"  
“你还记得昨晚的事吗？”

"No."

Shinji bit his lip. 真嗣咬了咬嘴唇。

As the pause lengthened, Asuka stirred a bit. Finally, she opened one eye a slit. "Why?" she growled suspiciously.  
随着停顿的延长，明日香微微动了动。最终，她眯起一只眼，狐疑地低吼道：“为什么？”

"You have to promise not to get mad."  
“你得答应不生气。”

"Shinji, we've known each other for five years and change by now. Woken up this exact way more than once. Since when has that _ever_ worked?"  
“真嗣，我们相识已有五年多，这样的早晨也不是第一次了。什么时候这招管用过？”

"Thought it was worth a shot."  
“想着值得一试。”

She sighed. "Can I have a few more minutes to enjoy waking up in your arms before we get to the inevitable disaster that makes us mad at each other again?"  
她叹了口气。“在我们再次因为那不可避免的灾难而互相生气之前，我能再享受几分钟在你怀里醒来的时光吗？”

"Um…. yeah, I think we're ok on that one."  
“嗯……是的，我想这方面我们没问题。”

"Good. I like this part. Stupid sexy Shinji," she muttered. "...did we have sex last night? Bits of me are sore."  
“好。我喜欢这部分。愚蠢又性感的真嗣。”她喃喃自语。“……我们昨晚做爱了吗？我有些地方酸痛。”

"I honestly can't remember. I _think_ so? We had a bit to drink."  
我真的记不清了。应该是吧？我们喝了不少。

"Scheiße… I hate it when that happens. Sex with you is _good_," Asuka complained. She sighed again. "Alright, hit me. What did we do this time?"  
“该死……我讨厌这种事发生。和你做爱感觉不错，”明日香抱怨道。她又叹了口气。“好吧，说吧。这次我们又做了什么？”

"I think we got married."  
“我想我们结婚了。”

Shinji's heart did a little leap when, out of the rapid kaleidoscope of emotions that flashed across Asuka's face, the preeminent one was joy. But wariness soon came to the forefront. "Ok… so you wanted me to promise not to get mad because… wait, we're both still in bed, I don't remember anything, and you don't either, so... what makes you think we got married?"  
当看到在明日香脸上闪过的纷繁情绪中，最突出的是喜悦时，真嗣的心不由得小小地跳动了一下。但很快，警觉便占据了上风。“好吧……所以你让我承诺不生气是因为……等等，我们俩都还在床上，我什么都不记得，你也是，那么……你凭什么认为我们结婚了？”

Shinji wiggled his left hand free and took hers, raising them in front of Asuka's face.  
真嗣挣脱了左手，握住她的手，将它们举到明日香面前。

Her eyes nearly crossed. "Oh… wow… um,... That's a nice ring….rings." She swallowed. "Ok...so…. We're married?"  
她的眼睛几乎要瞪出来了。“哦……哇……呃，……这戒指真漂亮……戒指。”她咽了咽口水。“好吧……所以……我们结婚了？”

Shinji winced. She sounded… happy. Hopeful. Eager, even. "Yyyyeah, that's… where it gets complicated."  
真嗣皱了皱眉。她听起来……很高兴。充满希望。甚至有些急切。“呃呃，是的，那……这就变得复杂了。”

"Because we just had one of the most important moments in our lives, and we can't remember Scheiße?"  
“因为我们刚刚经历了生命中最重要的时刻之一，而我们却什么也记不起来？”

Shinji rolled onto his back to reveal Rei still snuggled up on his far side. "Rei's wearing a ring too. Exactly like ours."  
真嗣翻身仰躺，露出丽依然蜷缩在他远侧的身影。“丽也戴着戒指。和我们的一模一样。”

"...we married Wondergirl _too_?!"  
“……我们也娶了明日香？！”

"And," Shinji waved at the bathroom door. Another angonized "HUUUUGGGRRRRRRHHGNLBBBBLE!" came from within.  
“而且，”真嗣朝浴室门挥了挥手。里面又传来一声痛苦的“呼——呃——呃——咕噜噜！”

Asuka blinked at him for a moment. "What."  
明日香对他眨了眨眼，片刻后说道：“什么。”

"I _said_ it got complicated."  
“我说了，情况变得复杂了。”

"How is the _four_ of us being married even possible?"  
"我们四个怎么可能结婚呢？"

"This is Vegas, and all the weird polygamy and stranger stuff the US authorized after Second Impact in the name of boosting birthrates?"  
"这里是拉斯维加斯，美国在第二次冲击后为了提高生育率，批准了各种奇怪的一夫多妻制和其他更离谱的东西。"

"And I'm still a US Citizen, so this is all probably legal." Asuka rubbed her face. "Where is Misato? This is all her fault, I'm sure of it. I'm going to kill her."  
"我还是个美国公民，所以这些大概都是合法的。" 明日香揉了揉脸。"美里在哪儿？这全是她的错，我敢肯定。我要杀了她。"

"I don't know. I just woke up. I tried waking the others without disturbing you, but Kaworu is… well, you can hear him. Rei just said 'that's nice', and went back to sleep."  
“我不知道。我刚醒来。我试着在不吵醒你的情况下叫醒其他人，但渚是……嗯，你可以听到他。绫波只是说了句‘那挺好’，就又睡回去了。”

Asuka sat up far enough to mildly glare at the bluenette. "She's lucky she's so cute, or I'd be more upset with her." Asuka's eyes narrowed. "What's that on her face?"  
明日香坐起身来，足够远地瞪着那位蓝发女孩。“她真幸运，这么可爱，不然我会更生气的。”明日香的眼睛眯了起来。“她脸上那是什么？”

Shinji looked closer. Rei shift had revealed what looked like a bandage on her face. "A… some gauze? Did she hurt herself last night?"  
真嗣凑近了些。丽换班时露出了她脸上看似绷带的东西。“是……某种纱布吗？她昨晚受伤了吗？”

Asuka reached over Shinji and gently tugged at the bandage, already coming up a bit from where Rei's face had rubbed on the pillow. It came away easily, revealing a small, fresh tattoo under the corner of Rei's left eye. "Is that… kanji?"  
明日香越过真嗣，轻轻地拉扯着绷带，那部分已经因为绫波的脸颊摩擦枕头而有些松动。绷带轻易地脱落，露出了绫波左眼下角一个新鲜的小纹身。“那是……汉字吗？”

Shinji examined it. He had to cover his mouth to avoid laughing out loud. "Snrk. Y-Yeah, it is."  
真嗣仔细端详着它，不得不捂住嘴以免笑出声来。“噗。嗯，确实是。”

Asuka shifted her glare to him. "Why are you laughing? What does it say?"  
明日香将目光转向他，厉声问道：“你笑什么？上面写了什么？”

"...Soryu." "...索琉。"

"What?" "什么？"

"Rei has your last name tattooed on her face. Right in the 'path of her tears', no less."  
"丽在你的脸上纹了你的姓氏。就在她的‘泪痕’上，毫不含糊。"

Asuka reached over to shake Rei awake. "Rei! Rei! Wake up!"  
明日香伸手去摇醒丽。"丽！丽！快醒醒！"

"Mmmuh?" “嗯？”

"...do you know you've got a tattoo on your face?"  
"...你知道你脸上有个纹身吗？"

"...what?" "...什么？"

"Why do you have _my name_ on your face, Wondergirl?" Asuka demanded.  
"你为什么把我的名字纹在脸上，奇迹少女？" 明日香质问道。

"I… do not remember getting a tattoo?"  
"我…不记得有纹身啊？"

Asuka reached up to gently draw a circle around the mark, carefully not touching it. "Not kidding, First. You've got my name's kanji right here."  
明日香伸出手，轻轻地在标记周围画了一个圈，小心翼翼地没有触碰到它。“不是开玩笑，队长。你这里纹着我的名字的汉字。”

"You... marked me?" Rei said hesitantly.  
“你……标记了我？” 丽犹豫地说。

"How should I know?!" Asuka threw her hands up. "I can't remember anything about last night after… like, mid-afternoon!" Asuka pulled Rei's left hand up. "And… are we fucking married now?! Do you remember anything?"  
“我怎么知道？！”明日香双手一挥。“昨晚从下午中段开始的事我一点印象都没有！”明日香拉起绫波的左手。“而且……我们现在是结婚了？！你记得什么吗？”

"Married? To...you? I thought…" Rei looked at her ring, then the matching ones on Asuka and Shinji. "Oh. And… Kaworu too?"  
"结婚？和你...你？我以为…" 丽看着她的戒指，然后是明日香和真嗣手上相配的戒指。"哦。还有… 渚薰也是？"

"HUUURRGGHGBBLBBLBBLLL!" “呼噜噜噜咕噜咕噜噜！”

"Apparently." 显然。

"Oh...I'm ok with this." “哦……我对此没意见。”

Asuka and Shinji stared at her like she'd grown a new head.  
明日香和真嗣盯着她，仿佛她头上长出了新脑袋。

"What?" Rei said. "You're all hot and I love all of you? I've slept with all three of you at least once in the last 4 years?"  
“什么？”绫波说，“你们都热得不行而我爱你们所有人？过去四年里我和你们三个至少都睡过一次？”

Shinji's eyes got wide and he looked at Asuka, a grin starting to form on his lips.  
真嗣的眼睛睁得大大的，他看着明日香，嘴角开始浮现出一丝笑意。

Asuka blushed and looked away. "Look, we were all drunk and you and I were fighting again. Rei was… comforting."  
明日香脸红了，转过头去。“听着，我们当时都喝醉了，你和我又吵了起来。丽她……在安慰我。”

"Then we did it again the next we-" Asuka reached over to grab Rei by the back of the head and seal her lips with a kiss.  
“然后我们第二天又——” 明日香伸手过去抓住绫波的后脑勺，用一个吻封住了她的唇。

Rei's smile when Asuka pulled back was beatific. "And that would be one of many reasons I do not mind the idea of being her wife," she said quietly.  
明日香退开后，绫波的微笑显得无比神圣。“而这只是我愿意成为她妻子的众多原因之一，”她轻声说道。

Asuka covered her face with her hands. "I'm too hungover for this. I'm going to make some hangover cure. Shinji, you see if Kaworu needs any help in there before he vomits up the rest of his internal organs. Rei, see if you can look around and find any traces of Misato, Hikari, their boytoys, or anything that looks like marriage certificates, whatever. If we really got married, there's got to at least be a receipt or _something_.  
明日香双手捂脸，"我宿醉得厉害，得去弄点解酒的东西。真嗣，你去看看卡罗有没有需要帮忙的，别让他把剩下的内脏都吐出来。丽，你四处找找，看有没有美里、光、他们的男友，或者任何像结婚证的东西。如果我们真的结婚了，总该有张收据什么的吧。"

"These are very nice rings," Rei said, looking at hers again. She raised her head, looking into space. "Also, I think I have been… 'ridden hard and put away wet'."  
“这些戒指非常漂亮。”丽看着自己的戒指再次说道。她抬起头，目光投向远方。“而且，我觉得自己好像……‘被使劲骑过，然后湿漉漉地收起来了’。”

Shinji nearly fell over on his way to the bathroom. Asuka walked right into one of the barstools around the counter of the kitchenette. "W-What?" she sputtered.  
真嗣在去洗手间的路上差点摔倒。明日香则径直撞上了厨房吧台旁的一个凳子。“什、什么？”她结巴道。

"My nether bits feel well and extensively used. Whatever happened last night, I believe a substantial part of it must have been extended sexual intercourse, most likely in consummation of our marriage." Rei looked vaguely annoyed. "I wish I could remember that."  
“我的下体感觉被充分且广泛地使用了。无论昨晚发生了什么，我相信其中很大一部分必定是长时间的性行为，很可能是我们婚姻的圆满完成。”丽看起来有些模糊的烦恼。“我希望我能记得那件事。”

Asuka turned back to look at Rei again. "Wondergirl, are you still drunk? You're sounding like you do when hammered."  
明日香转回来看着丽。“三无少女，你还在醉吗？你听起来就像喝醉时那样。”

"No, but I might be somewhat giddy from the prospect of you all being my spouses. I find the concept... most agreeable." There was no change in Rei's usual deadpan cool.  
"不，但我可能有点儿因为你们都将成为我的配偶而感到兴奋。我觉得这个概念……非常合我意。" 丽平常的冷淡表情没有丝毫变化。

Asuka muttered something in German and began pulling bottles of orange juice and Gatorade out of the kitchenette's fridge. "Hurensöhne! There's Tylenol in the minibar… but it's twelve dollars for a bottle! What a ripoff!"  
明日香用德语咕哝了一句，开始从厨房的小冰箱里拿出橙汁和佳得乐瓶子。"混蛋！迷你吧里有泰诺……但一瓶要十二美元！真是坑人！"

"We're probably not the first hangover sufferers in Vegas," Shinji said, entering the bathroom. "Hey, Kaworu are you-" He froze and backed out of the bathroom slowly. "Uhhhh… Rei, Asuka? There's a creature in the bathtub."  
"我们大概不是拉斯维加斯第一批宿醉的人，"真嗣说着走进浴室。"嘿，渚薰，你——"他突然僵住，缓缓退出了浴室。"呃……绫波，明日香？浴缸里有只生物。"

"You found Pen Pen?" “你找到 Pen Pen 了？”

Shinji shook his head and cracked the door open to reveal a polar bear in the tub. "Wrong Arctic."  
真嗣摇了摇头，推开门，只见一只北极熊泡在浴缸里。“找错北极了。”

Kaworu slowly raised his head from the toilet bowl, feebly wiping at his chin. "...Oh Gott. Wait… maybe he will eat me, and end my suffering," he said weakly.  
渚薰缓缓从马桶边抬起头，无力地擦拭着下巴。“……哦，天哪。等等……也许他会吃了我，结束我的痛苦。”他虚弱地说道。

"Kaworu are you-" Shinji whispered. He tiptoed his way back into the bathroom. His eyes sought Kaworu's hand. Yup, matching ring. "Tell me you remember last night?"  
"渚薰，你——" 真嗣低声问道。他踮着脚尖悄悄回到浴室。目光寻找着渚薰的手。没错，是同款的戒指。"告诉我，你还记得昨晚的事吗？"

"Huh? Uh… no...not a thing past…" Kaworu knitted his brow. "Um,... about the point where Misato said we...wait… weren't we going to celebrate Touji and Hikari's engagement?"  
“嗯？呃…不…没有什么事过去…”渚薰皱起眉头。“嗯…在美里说我们…等等…我们不是要去庆祝真治和光子的订婚吗？”

"Well… um… how about you slowly, carefully follow me out of the bathroom, and away from the giant carnivore…" Shinji took another look at the still sleeping polar bear. "...That is wearing a fez and cuddling a bottle of Stolichnaya?"  
“呃…嗯…要不你慢慢来，小心地跟着我离开浴室，远离那只巨大的食肉动物…” 真嗣又看了一眼仍在熟睡的北极熊。“…它还戴着一顶费兹帽，抱着一瓶斯托利查那伏特加？”

"Definitely Misato's fault," Asuka said.  
“绝对是美里小姐的错，”明日香说。

"But if I stay in here, maybe I'll get lucky and he'll kill me," Kaworu complained. "Oh Gott, my head…"  
"但如果我留在这里，或许我会走运，他可能会杀了我。" 渚薰抱怨道，"哦，天哪，我的头……"

"Kaworu, I _really_ want you to not get eaten by a possibly hungover bear," Shinji said. "Especially when we… er… might be married now."  
"渚薰，我真的希望你不要被一只可能宿醉的熊吃掉，" 真嗣说道。"尤其是在我们……呃……可能现在已经结婚了的情况下。"

Kaworu lolled his head around to blink blearily at Shinji. "...what?"  
渚薰懒洋洋地转过头，睡眼惺忪地眨眼看着真嗣。“……什么？”

Shinji helped his...husband? To stand up, and supported him as they withdrew cautiously from the bathroom. Shinji closed the door, wincing at even the tiny click the latch made when he did.  
真嗣扶着他的...丈夫？站起身来，小心翼翼地扶着他从浴室撤出。真嗣关上门，听到门锁那微小的咔嗒声时还皱了皱眉。

"Oh, don't worry, Shinji. Lieutenant Growlski won't hurt you unless you try to take away his vodka," Rei said cheerily. Well, cheerily for Rei.  
“哦，别担心，真嗣。格罗尔斯基中尉不会伤害你的，除非你试图抢走他的伏特加，”丽欢快地说道。好吧，对丽来说算是欢快了。

"Lieutenant… Growlski? Rei, how do you know its name?"  
"中尉……格罗尔斯基？丽，你怎么知道它的名字？"

"I have no idea." Rei rustled some papers. "I think I may have found our wedding papers. And a...note from Misato?"  
"我完全不知道。" 丽翻动了几页文件。"我觉得我可能找到了我们的结婚证书。还有一封……美里小姐的便条？"

"What does it say?" Asuka said, pouring out four glasses of juice and Gatorade and placing painkillers beside each glass. Kaworu allowed Shinji to guide him to a stool at the counter, where he slumped forward and put his head down.  
"上面写了什么？" 明日香说着，倒出四杯果汁和佳得乐，并在每杯旁边放上止痛药。渚薰任由真嗣引导他到吧台的凳子上，他向前一倾，把头埋在双臂之间。

"I do not know. It is written entirely in Drunk Misato." She walked over to Asuka and handed her the note.  
"我不知道。这完全是用醉醺醺的律子写的。" 她走到明日香身边，把纸条递给她。

Asuka looked at the paper, shook her head, and calmly handed the note over to Shinji. "You're the most Japanese of us. I already can't read normal kanji, nevermind... _that_."  
明日香看了看纸条，摇了摇头，平静地把它递给了真嗣。"你是最日本人的。我连正常的汉字都看不懂，更别提...这个了。"

Shinji squinted at the paper, but shook his head as well. "This isn't Kanji. This is... Drunk Misato. There's not even one actual character on here. There's a sketch of a bottle and… I think that's a dickbutt." He looked at Rei. "No other sign of her?"  
真嗣眯着眼睛看纸条，但也摇了摇头。"这不是汉字。这是...醉醺醺的律子。这里甚至没有一个真正的字符。有一个瓶子的草图和…我想那是个屁股。"他看着绫波。"没有她的其他迹象吗？"

"Her bed is not slept in, and all that's here is her underwear."  
"她的床没有睡过的痕迹，这里只有她的内衣。"

Shinji sighed, and took a deep, forced swallow from his glass before starting to sort through the papers.  
真嗣叹了口气，强迫自己从杯中深深地喝了一口，然后开始整理文件。

"What's the verdict?" Asuka asked after a few minutes of paper shuffling.  
"结论是什么？" 几分钟后，明日香在纸张翻动的声音中问道。

"According to all this, yes, we're all married, as a quartet, no, I don't know how that all works, yes, I'm serious, and no, we're not getting out of this." He sighed. "Those same post-Second Impact laws that allow all this also say we can't get any kind of annulment or divorce for at least 96 hours."  
"根据这一切，是的，我们四个人结婚了，不，我不知道这是怎么运作的，是的，我是认真的，而且不，我们摆脱不了这个局面。" 他叹了口气。"那些在第二次冲击后制定的法律，允许这一切的同时也规定了至少 96 小时内我们无法获得任何形式的无效宣告或离婚。"

"And we fly back to Japan in 48," Asuka pointed out.  
"而我们 48 小时后就要飞回日本，" 明日香指出。"

"I… do not wish to get a divorce," Rei said softly. "And it would be difficult to get all the tattoos removed."  
“我……不想离婚，”丽平静地说道，“而且要去除所有纹身也挺难的。”

"You don't want to… wait, what tattoos?" Asuka said.  
“你不想……等等，什么纹身？”明日香说。

Rei pointed at Shinji's chest. "You have Asuka, my, and Kaworu's names over your heart. He has a matching set of yours, mine, and Asuka's. I have Asuka's last name on my face, and I suspect from the soreness, yours and Kaworu's on my back. Asuka, could you turn around and move your hair off your back?"  
丽指着真嗣的胸口说：“你的心口有我和明日香、渚的名字。他有一套和你、我和明日香的对应纹身。我脸上是明日香的姓氏，而且从酸痛感来看，背上还有你和渚的。明日香，你能转过身来把头发撩开吗？”

Shinji jerked his head down to stare at his chest. Yup, there were fresh, sharp katakana spelling out the three names, right over his heart, with Asuka's in the middle, a bit larger. It had probably gone first.  
碇真嗣猛地低下头，凝视着自己的胸膛。没错，那里清晰地刻着三个用锐利片假名拼写的名字，正位于心脏上方，其中明日香的名字居中，稍大一些。它可能是最先刻上的。

"Well, do I?" Asuka demanded.  
“那么，我有吗？”明日香质问道。

Shinji jerked his head back up. ...partway up. He got stuck for a second staring at Asuka's admittedly perfect backside. He never got tired of staring at…. Oh, right, he was supposed to be looking for tattoos!  
真嗣猛地抬起头，...只抬到一半。他愣了一会儿，盯着明日香那无可挑剔的背影。他怎么也看不够……哦，对了，他应该是在找纹身！

When his eyes got a little higher, there they were. His name in fancy Western script, right on the small of her back, with Kaworu and Rei's names forming part of a filigreed circle around it. It was… distractingly pretty… The swirling, elaborate lettering made him want to trace his fingers over it, following the letters.  
当他的视线稍稍上移，那行字便映入眼帘。他的名字以华丽的西文书写，正位于她腰背的凹陷处，而渚薰与绫波的名字则环绕其周，构成了一圈精巧的花纹。这图案……美得令人分心……那蜿蜒繁复的字体，让他忍不住想要用手指去描摹，顺着字母的轨迹。

"Uh… yeah… right on your back, here," he told Asuka, delicately circling his fingertip around it.  
“呃……对……就在你背上，这里，”他告诉明日香，小心翼翼地用指尖在上面画圈。

"EEEEEYYYAAAIIII!" Asuka shrieked in surprise, leaping into the air. "Stop that! It tickles!"  
“哎呀呀呀呀呀！”明日香惊叫着跳了起来，“别这样！痒死了！”

"Sorry!" “对不起！”

Asuka tried peering over her own shoulder. "I… I have your names as a _tramp stamp_?!"  
明日香试图从自己的肩膀上看过去。“我……我把你们的名字纹成腰间纹身了？！”

"It's very artistic," Kaworu said weakly, just raising his head. "Did… I sketch the tracework? It kind of looks like my hand."  
"非常艺术性，" 渚薰虚弱地说道，只是抬起了头。"我……我画了这些线条吗？看起来有点像我的手笔。"

"What about me?" Rei interrupted. "I feel it on my shoulder blades, but what does it look like?"  
"那我呢？" 绫波零打断道。"我感觉在后肩胛骨上，但它看起来是什么样的？"

The bluenette had turned around, and was looking over her shoulder for their reactions. And she got them.  
蓝发少女转过身来，透过肩膀观察他们的反应。而她确实得到了他们的反应。

"Oh, wow, Rei… You've got _wings_," Asuka said.  
“哦，哇，丽…你有翅膀了。”明日香说道。

"I… I don't know what to say, Rei. You… I don't deserve to… to be…" Shinji couldn't finish.  
"我…我不知道该说什么，丽。你…我不配…去…" 真嗣说不下去了。

So Kaworu did. "...We're your wings?" He wobbled upright from his stool and stepped close enough to Rei to gently trace his fingers along the delicate, feathered angel wings that lead down from near the top of Rei's back, with 'Shinji' and 'Kaworu' written on them. They looked almost lifelike.  
于是薰接过了话。"...我们是你的翅膀？" 他从凳子上摇摇晃晃地站起身，走近丽，用手指轻轻沿着那对精致的、羽毛丰满的天使翅膀描摹，这对翅膀从丽背部的上方延伸下来，上面写着'真嗣'和'薰'。它们看起来栩栩如生。

"And my name in the 'path of your tears'," Asuka said, shaking her head. "I never knew you cared that much, Rei."  
"而我的名字在你'泪痕之路'上，" 明日香说，摇了摇头。"我从不知道你这么在乎，绫波。"

"I do. I am sorry I remain…" Rei fidgeted with her hands. "Bad at expressing deep emotion. But I do love you all. The idea of your names being permanently on my skin is… I feel simultaneously loved and aroused."  
"我是的。我很抱歉我依然……" 绫波摆弄着双手。"不擅长表达深切情感。但我确实爱你们所有人。你们的名字永久刻在我的皮肤上……这让我既感到被爱又感到兴奋。"

Kaworu and Shinji shared a look. "Uhh…" they said together.  
渚薰和真嗣交换了一个眼神。“呃……”他们异口同声地说。

Asuka snorted. "Damn, Rei, I knew you were kind of kinky. Ok, whatever the Hell we did last night, we must have had some good shit to drink to spark it. I blame Misato. So we need to find her, and see if _she_ can explain any of this. If she's not in evidence, we need to start following the trail. The address for the chapel's on those papers, right?"  
明日香哼了一声。“该死，绫波，我知道你有点变态。好吧，不管昨晚我们干了什么，我们一定是喝了些好东西才这么兴奋。我怪美里。所以我们需要找到她，看看她能不能解释这一切。如果她不在场，我们需要开始追踪线索。教堂的地址就在那些文件上，对吧？”

"Yes." "是的。"

"Good. We'll start there. There's probably a receipt or charge record on our cards for these tattoos, too. So we can try that too." Asuka thought for a moment. "We haven't tried calling Misato, Hikari, or anyone, right?"  
好，我们就从这里开始。我们的卡上可能也有这些纹身的收据或消费记录。所以我们可以试试那个。”明日香想了一会儿。“我们还没试着联系美里、光村或其他人，对吧？”

"Not unless someone did it while I was regurgitating everything I've eaten in the last month," Kaworu said, blearily. He nearly choked trying to force down the rest of the glass of Gatorade Asuka had put in front of him, then stood up to try digging ice out of the freezer.  
"除非有人趁我吐光过去一个月吃的东西时动手脚，"渚薰含糊地说道。他差点呛到，努力咽下明日香递来的佳得乐饮料，然后起身去冰箱里找冰块。

"I'll find our phones. ...And our pants. I have no idea where our clothes are," Shinji said.  
我会找到我们的手机。...还有我们的裤子。我不知道我们的衣服在哪里。” 真嗣说。

"Oh...we'll have to put on clothes, won't we?" Rei said. She sounded disappointed.  
“哦……我们得穿上衣服，不是吗？”丽说。她的声音听起来有些失望。

"If I promise the rest of us will help you out of them later, will that make you feel better?" Asuka said sarcastically.  
“如果我保证我们其他人稍后会帮你摆脱这些麻烦，你会感觉好些吗？”明日香讽刺地说道。

Rei gave her one of her tiny smiles. "Promise?"  
丽给了她一个微小的微笑。“答应了？”

"What are we going to do about the polar bear in the bathroom?" Kaworu asked, gingerly putting a ziploc bag of ice against his head. "Besides feed me to it so I stop wishing for the sweet embrace of death?"  
"我们该怎么处理浴室里的北极熊？" 渚薰小心翼翼地将一袋冰块贴在头上问道，"除了把我喂给它，好让我不再渴望那甜蜜的死亡怀抱之外？"

"We'll let the hotel staff figure that one out. We've got a mystery to solve," Asuka replied.  
"我们会让酒店员工来解决这个问题。我们还有个谜团要解开，"明日香回答道。

"We better leave the maid one hell of a tip," Shinji muttered. "Ah… you're taking this really well, Asuka. I kind of expected you to explode or try to strangle me."  
"我们最好给女佣留一大笔小费，" 真嗣嘀咕道。"啊…你接受得真好，明日香。我以为你会爆发或者试图掐死我。"

Asuka left the kitchen and walked over to where he was searching through the scattered sheets and pillows around the bed for their clothes and grabbed him in a surprisingly tight hug. "Shinji, I am currently half-freaking out because we can't remember anything about how or why we did this, half-giddy that we finally _did_ do this, and half-confused as all fuck as to why we included Wondergirl and the Angel of Prettyboys in the mix. I'm also still not completely convinced this isn't a really weird dream from eating too much buffet last night. So on balance, I've decided to just roll with it for now, and… maybe it's not so bad? I… you and I have been dancing around each other for years, never able to just… stop dancing and make it real. Maybe I kind of needed to be just… given a push like this."  
明日香离开厨房，走到他在床上四处寻找散落的床单和枕头下的衣服的地方，给了他一个出乎意料的紧紧拥抱。"真嗣，我现在一半在抓狂因为我们不记得是怎么或为什么做了这件事，一半在兴奋因为我们终于做了这件事，还有一半完全搞不懂为什么我们会把绫波和美少年天使也牵扯进来。我也仍然不完全相信这不是因为昨晚吃太多自助餐而做的奇怪梦。所以总的来说，我决定暂时就这样顺其自然，而且…也许没那么糟糕？我…你和我已经绕着彼此转了这么多年，从未能真正…停下来，让这一切变得真实。也许我需要这样…被推一把。"

Shinji's breath caught in his throat. "Asuka, I… You know I've loved you for years… I'd just… never thought we'd…"  
碇真嗣的呼吸一窒。“明日香，我……你知道我多年来一直爱着你……我只是……从未想过我们会有……”

"Maybe you needed the push too, huh?" she said softly.  
"也许你也需要那个推动力，是吧？" 她轻声说道。

"Is… I mean…. Rei and Kaworu too?" he asked hesitantly.  
"是…我是说…丽和渚薰也是吗？" 他犹豫地问道。

She tilted her head up for a kiss. "Eh, you and I both kind of love Rei already, and I've seen you and Kaworu together looking such a cute couple I have to admit I got jealous sometimes. And after the four of us living together for so long, life would feel… half-empty without them. So… yeah, maybe I don't really mind… having a wife and two husbands?" She blushed quite a bit by the end of that admission. She still managed to meet his eyes… after a moment. "You think you can handle two half-Angels who I know you love already, plus me, the love of your life? Because if we do this… I'm going all-in, baka-Shinji. No holding back anymore."  
她抬起头索吻。“呃，你和我都已经有点爱上丽了，而且我看到你和渚薰在一起时那么可爱的一对，有时候我不得不承认我会嫉妒。再加上我们四个人一起生活了这么久，没有他们，生活会感觉……空了一半。所以……是的，也许我真的不介意……有一个妻子和两个丈夫？”说到最后，她的脸颊泛起了红晕。她还是设法在片刻后与他对视。“你觉得你能应付两个你已经爱上的半天使，还有我，你生命中的挚爱吗？因为如果我们这么做……我会全力以赴，笨蛋真嗣。不再有任何保留。”

He swallowed hard. _This_ would be one of the reasons he loved Asuka. The way she could just… cut through everything, and make him feel like he was the world to her. It made him want to do the same for her. "I… I kind of want this too. For… pretty much the same reasons. I can't imagine living without them and you."  
他艰难地咽了咽口水。这就是他爱明日香的原因之一。她总能……直击要害，让他感觉自己是她的全世界。这让他也想为她做同样的事。“我……我也想要这样。因为……几乎同样的原因。我无法想象没有他们和你一起生活。”

"Now I'm going to make a joke about watching you and Kaworu go at it, because #1, that's hot, and #2, its easier than facing the oh-holy-shit levels of emotional scariness that goes with seriously thinking about ohfuckohfuckouhfuckI'mmarriedI'mmarriedI'mmarriedtothreepeopleandIthinkIlovethemand-" Asuka let go of him and clamped her hands over her mouth.  
“现在我要开个玩笑，说看你和渚薰那啥，因为第一，那很火辣，第二，总比面对那些该死的情感恐怖级别要好，比如认真思考‘卧槽卧槽卧槽我结婚了我是三个人的妻子我还觉得我爱他们’之类的——” 明日香松开手，猛地捂住自己的嘴。

Shinji smiled weakly. "Y-Yeah… same reasons." He kissed her on the forehead and gave her one last squeeze. "Let's… find out what happened."  
真嗣虚弱地笑了笑。“嗯……同样的原因。”他在她的额头上轻轻一吻，最后一次紧紧拥抱了她。“我们……去弄清楚发生了什么。”

"Everyone?" Rei spoke up from the now open door to the bathroom. "Lieutenant Growlski says he wants breakfast. Do we have any more vodka?"  
“所有人？”绫波从现在敞开的浴室门里说道，“格罗尔斯基中尉说他想要吃早餐。我们还有伏特加吗？”

Shinji paled a bit. "Um… Rei? Aren't you nervous about ah… 'Lieutenant Growlski' trying to… eat you?"  
真嗣的脸色有点苍白。“呃… 绫波？你不担心…‘格罗尔斯基中尉’试图…吃掉你吗？”

"He's fine as long as he gets his vodka," Rei said serenely.  
"只要他能喝到伏特加，他就没事。" 丽平静地说道。

Shinji eyed the bathroom door nervously. "What happens if he doesn't get his vodka?"  
真嗣紧张地盯着浴室门。"如果他喝不到伏特加会怎么样？"

"Then he's not fine." Rei headed into the kitchen area and began to rummage through the cabinets. "Help me find some, Shinji?"  
"那他就不好了。" 丽走进厨房区域，开始翻找橱柜。"帮我找找，真嗣？"

Shinji squeezed Asuka's hand one last time and went to help Rei.  
真嗣最后一次紧握了明日香的手，然后去帮助丽。

"Do _not_ get eaten by the bear!" Asuka called after him. She resumed searching for their keys or phones in the cushions of the suite's couch. She found her shirt from last night under the cocktail table. She picked it up, but wrinkled her nose at the strong scent of alcohol pouring off it. As if they'd needed any more confirmation that they'd done a truly epic amount of drinking yesterday. "Enough to get married to three people, but forget about it and the whole rest of the evening," she muttered.  
“别被熊吃掉了！”明日香在他身后喊道。她继续在套房沙发的垫子里寻找他们的钥匙或手机。她在鸡尾酒桌下找到了昨晚的衬衫。她捡起来，却因上面浓烈的酒精气味而皱起了鼻子。仿佛他们还需要更多证据来证明昨天确实喝得天昏地暗。“足够跟三个人结婚，然后忘得一干二净，连带着整个晚上，”她喃喃自语。

Kaworu tapped her on the shoulder, presenting her with a set of fresh clothes. "I found your suitcase under some flung sheets. Still no sign of our phones."  
薰轻轻拍了拍她的肩膀，递给她一套干净的衣服。“我在一些散落的床单下找到了你的行李箱。手机还是没找到。”

She took the blouse, underwear, and pants with a nod of thanks. She had to pull her eyes away from the ring on his hand as she took them.  
她接过衬衫、内衣和裤子，点头致谢。接过衣物时，她不得不移开视线，不去看他手上的戒指。

Kaworu's own gaze was stuck just as much on hers. She tried to ignore it as she started getting dressed right there.  
渚薰的目光也同样停留在她的身上。她试图忽视这一点，就在那里开始穿衣服。

"Asuka? "“明日香？”

"Yeah?" She stepped into her semi-lacy panties and pulled them up. She was vaguely bemused to note they were the same blue as Rei's hair.  
"嗯？" 她踏进那半透明的蕾丝内裤，拉了上去。她有些好笑地注意到，这内裤的颜色和她头发是同一种蓝色。

"Why me?" "为什么是我？"

She fastened her bra behind her and adjusted the straps. "What do you… oh, why are you wearing a ring too?"  
她在背后扣上胸罩，调整了肩带。"怎么了……哦，你为什么也戴了个戒指？"

He nodded. "You and Shinji, everyone's been expecting that for years, despite how often you two broke up and reconciled. And I can even see how much you and Rei really care for each other, even without my Sight. Rei and Shinji likewise. But… I'm the weird new one, the outsider in your little trio, the _Angel_… I mean, I know you're all my friends, and even sometimes a lover, but… do I really… am I worthy of this?"  
他点点头。“你和真嗣，大家多年来一直期待着你们复合，尽管你们分分合合无数次。我甚至能看出你和绫波之间真挚的情感，即使不借助我的‘视线’。绫波和真嗣亦然。但……我是那个新来的怪人，你们这个小三人组的局外人，那个天使……我是说，我知道你们都是我的朋友，甚至有时是恋人，但……我真的……我有这个资格吗？”

Asuka frowned. "Ok, number one, none of us even remember how we went from 'celebratory drinking about Hikari and her gorilla' to 'let's all get tattooed and married', so I don't know what to say in the more immediate sense. Number two… you're not 'just a friend', Kaworu. Angel? You've been closer than anyone else to all three of us for years at this point. Number three…" Asuka tried to sort through her wildly confused feelings. Failing to come up with a coherent, articulable line of explanation, she fell back on a more base one, that had the virtue of being at least _part_ of the truth. "You're good."  
明日香皱眉道：“好吧，首先，我们都不记得是怎么从‘庆祝光和她的猩猩’变成‘一起去纹身结婚’的，所以我不太知道怎么在更直接的层面上回答你。其次……你不仅仅是‘朋友’，渚薰。天使？你多年来比任何人都更亲近我们三个。第三……”明日香试图整理她混乱的情绪。未能找到连贯可表达的解释，她退而求其次，选择了一个至少部分真实的说法。“你很好。”

"Good?" “很好？”

Asuka looked down briefly, then away from the still distractingly nude and very gorgeous Nephilim. "...in bed."  
明日香短暂地低头看了一眼，随即移开了视线，不再注视那位依然赤裸且极其迷人的拿非利人。“……在床上。”

"_Bullshit! I've got_ _**years**_ _of practice on him, and I_ _**know**_ _he likes it," Asuka smirked. "There's no way you can even match me, let alone beat me."_  
“胡说！我比他多练了几年，而且我知道他喜欢，”明日香得意地笑了。“你连跟我比都做不到，更别说赢我了。”"

_"Hey, my first couple of boyfriends may have been more interested in notching 'I banged an Angel' on their bedpost and damn blogs than in really seeing me for me, but that is one thing I got out of all of them: I am the **king**_ _of blowjobs," Kaworu countered. "And Shinji damn near ripped my ears off the last time you dared us to do it while you and Rei watched and cheered."_  
“嘿，我的前几任男友可能更热衷于在床头板上刻下‘我睡了一个天使’并在他们的博客上炫耀，而不是真正地了解我，但这是我从他们那里得到的一件事：我是口交之王，”渚薰反驳道。“上次你敢让我们在你和绫波观看并欢呼时做，真嗣差点把我的耳朵都扯掉了。”"

_"Oh yeah?!" "哦，是吗？！"_

_"Yeah!" "是的！"_

_The argument had escalated to dueling practical demonstrations. Kaworu had needed a full minute just to uncross his eyes after Asuka finished him off. Asuka had yelled loud enough at her moment of climax Shinji had needed to cover his ears. Rei had merely smiled that wickedly content way she did when drunk and horny, and declared that the only means of truly settling the argument was for them both to do Shinji at once. Shinji's surprised 'guh-WHA?' had been stilled by Rei giving him her best coquettish look, with one finger on her lower lip.  
争论已经升级到了实战演示的对决。卡罗尔在明日香结束战斗后花了整整一分钟才让眼睛不再交叉。明日香在高潮时刻的喊声大到真嗣不得不捂住耳朵。丽只是带着那种醉酒且饥渴时邪恶满足的微笑，宣布解决争论的唯一方法就是让他们俩同时对真嗣下手。真嗣惊讶的'呃-什么？'被丽用她最迷人的眼神和下唇上的手指制止了。_

_Shinji had no complaints after that, only the repeated and mountingly fervent gasping of both their names. However, their heads close together had begun distracting them both into increasingly heated kissing between bobs. That had ended when Asuka had grabbed Kaworu by the back of the neck, pulled him on top of her, and demanded more... direct satisfaction, immediately.  
自那以后，真嗣没有任何怨言，只有他们名字不断重复且愈发热烈的喘息声。然而，他们紧靠在一起的头开始让他们分心，转向越来越激烈的亲吻。直到明日香抓住薰的后颈，将他拉到自己身上，并要求立即得到更直接的满足，这一幕才结束。_

_That Shinji and Rei had promptly attached themselves to her left and right sides only made it better. Asuka very quickly discovered a few things: Kaworu was a tender, skilled, and gentle lover, he never stopped looking into her eyes, and she really, really liked being under him with Rei and Shinji pressed against her sides, taking turns kissing her and teasing her breasts. She felt surrounded, the center of attention… and loved. Intensely, deeply, completely. Her three favorite people, with her, holding her, loving her…  
真嗣和丽立即贴在她左右两侧，这让一切变得更加美好。明日香很快发现了几件事：薰是一个温柔、熟练且体贴的情人，他从未停止注视她的眼睛，而她真的很喜欢在他身下，丽和真嗣紧贴在她两侧，轮流亲吻她并逗弄她的胸部。她感到被包围，成为焦点……并被深深爱着。强烈、深沉、完全。她最爱的三个人，与她在一起，拥抱着她，爱着她……_

_She didn't want it to end.  
她不希望这一切结束。_

_But eventually she screamed her release into Shinji's mouth, and the morning came. She and Shinji were together again, and they didn't discuss the night before. Not in that level of detail.  
但最终，她在真嗣的唇间尖叫着释放了自己，晨光也随之降临。她和真嗣再次在一起，他们没有详细讨论前一晚的事。没有达到那个深度。_

_But it still happened again a couple more times.  
但这种情况还是又发生了几次。_

_Per month. 每个月。_

_She wanted more. But how do you say something like that?  
她渴望更多。但这种话该如何启齿呢？_

"You're... good. A good lover. And I like sex. How many… look, Kaworu, there's you, and there's Shinji. And that's it. That's all the men I've let touch me in the last… three years?"  
“你……很好。一个好情人。而且我喜欢性爱。有多少……听着，渚薰，有你，还有真嗣。这就是全部了。这是我过去……三年里允许触碰我的所有男人。”

Kaworu blinked at her. "What, really? Half the time you and Shinji break up, you're dating some new hot guy within a day or two. You… never?"  
渚薰对她眨了眨眼。“什么，真的吗？每次你和真嗣分手，不出一两天你就会和某个新帅哥约会。你……从来没有？”

"Nope. Hell, more than half of them are just me trying to make Shinji jealous," Asuka admitted.  
"不，见鬼，超过一半只是为了激起真嗣的嫉妒，"明日香承认道。

Kaworu started to smile. "That does kind of undercut the 'I like sex' justification. If that was all there was to it, you'd be all over them too. If it's just Shinji and I, that suggests…"  
渚薰开始微笑。"那确实削弱了'我喜欢性'的辩解。如果只是那样，你也会对他们感兴趣。如果只是我和真嗣，那就意味着……"

Asuka turned away, hiding her face. "Halt's Maul."  
明日香转过身去，遮住自己的脸。"哈尔的巨锤。"

Kaworu's smile deepened. "You don't just sleep around, Asuka. You demand more than that. You only sleep with people you-"  
渚薰的微笑加深了。“你不是随便和人上床的那种人，明日香。你要求的不仅仅是那样。你只会和你——”

Asuka spun back around. "I said shut it, idiot!"  
明日香猛地转过身来。“我说了闭嘴，白痴！”

"This isn't just about sex, is it?"  
“这不仅仅是关于性，对吧？”

She punched him in the chest, lightly. "Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!" She punched him again. "You've been living with us since the end of the War, you're closer to us than anyone, even Misato and Kaji, and I know how you feel about Shinji and Rei. You make them happy, they like you too, and I'm not going to just… cut you out and leave you alone. So whatever crazy logic persuaded us that suddenly getting _group-married_ last night was a good idea, for my part there's no way I'd… leave you out, alright? That's it." Asuka crossed her arms and looked away again. "Idiot."  
她轻轻地捶打他的胸口。“笨蛋！笨蛋！笨蛋！”她又捶了一下。“战争结束后你就一直和我们住在一起，你比任何人都亲近我们，甚至比美里和加持还要亲近，我也知道你对真嗣和绫波的感情。你让他们快乐，他们也喜欢你，我不会就这样……把你排除在外，让你孤单一人。所以无论是什么疯狂的逻辑说服我们昨晚突然集体结婚是个好主意，就我而言，我绝不会……把你排除在外，好吗？就这样。”明日香交叉双臂，再次别过头去。“笨蛋。”

She squeaked in alarm when Kaworu suddenly picked her up by the waist and spun her around in the air, grinning. "Aaack! Put me down, you lunatic!" Her head spun.  
当渚薰突然搂住她的腰将她举起在空中旋转时，她惊慌地尖叫起来，渚薰咧嘴笑着。“啊啊！放我下来，你这个疯子！”她的头都晕了。

"I know this song!" he said. "I've seen it before!"  
“我知道这首歌！”他说。“我以前见过！”

"What the Hell are you _talking_ about, du Dummkopf?!"  
“你到底在说什么鬼话，笨蛋？”

He lowered her down and crushed her to him, kissing the side of her neck. "You used to sound like this about him. And I know where that went. So if… Asuka, you know what I am, what I nearly did before Rei and I found a way to mute the Call, and you _still_ accept me. You may not be able to say it, but this," he pulled back and held up his left hand, "this says more than words ever could. This is the ultimate expression of acceptance and…" He closed his eyes, still smiling. "You said you 'wouldn't leave me alone'. I know how difficult emotional intimacy is for you. That you'd include me in… Asuka, this is the second most wonderful thing anyone's ever done for me."  
他将她放下并紧紧拥入怀中，亲吻她的脖颈一侧。“你以前对他也是这样说的。我知道那结果如何。所以如果……明日香，你知道我是什么，知道我在遇见丽并找到抑制召唤的方法之前差点做了什么，而你依然接受我。你或许说不出口，但这个，”他后退一步，举起左手，“这个胜过千言万语。这是最极致的接纳和……”他闭上眼睛，依旧微笑着。“你说你‘不会让我孤单’。我知道情感上的亲密对你有多难。你愿意把我包括在内……明日香，这是别人为我做的第二美好的事。”

Asuka felt her pride prickle a bit. "Second?" she pouted.  
明日香感到一丝骄傲的刺痛。“第二？”她噘嘴道。

"Rei saving me from the Call narrowly wins."  
「零拼尽全力从召唤中救了我。」

.

_The alarms and sirens far above were inaudible at this depth, but Kaworu knew they were going off. Two Nephilim forcing open Heaven's Gate and entering the very heart of Terminal Dogma must have set off every alarm in NERV, even without the immense Pattern Blue signal their AT-Fields must have sent off.  
在这个深度，上方的警报和警笛声已无法听见，但渚薰知道它们正在响起。两个天使强行打开天堂之门，进入终端教条的核心，必定触发了 NERV 内所有的警报，更不用说他们巨大的蓝色信号 AT 力场所引发的反应了。_

_Kaworu looked up at the titanic form hanging from the gigantic red cross before them. Even hanging mid-air on the wings of their AT-Fields, Lilith's true body still towered over them. The constant siren song of the Call was a hurricane-loud scream this close. Only the knowledge that this was truly Lilith, not Adam, allowed Kaworu to keep his will in control over his instincts. That, and his trust in his companion.  
渚薰抬头望向悬挂在他们面前巨大红色十字架上的巨型身影。即便依靠 AT 力场的翅膀悬浮在半空中，莉莉丝的真身依然高耸在他们之上。在这般近距离下，召唤的持续歌声如同飓风般震耳欲聋。唯有确信这是真正的莉莉丝而非亚当，以及对同伴的信任，才让渚薰能够控制住自己的本能。_

_"Are you sure this will work?" he asked her.  
“你确定这会有效吗？”他问她。_

_Rei turned, giving him a perfectly blank look. Only the faint hint of steel in her eye told him she was just as intent on her goal as ever. "No. This will either work, cause you to explode, or trigger you into an irreversible overload state that will require me to kill you to stop. But I am confident the first is the most likely. You trust me, and are maintaining conscious control of your barriers. You retain the ability to willingly lower them. That and your half-Lilim body will allow me to manipulate and integrate sufficient Progenitor-material into your Core that the Call will be satisfied and silenced forever." She paused. "If you are still willing."  
丽转身，给了他一个完全空白的表情。只有她眼中微弱的坚定之光告诉他，她对目标的执着一如既往。“不。这要么会成功，要么会让你爆炸，或者触发你进入不可逆转的超载状态，我必须杀了你才能阻止。但我相信第一种可能性最大。你信任我，并且保持着对屏障的意识控制。你保留了自愿降低它们的能力。再加上你那半莉莉丝的身体，将使我能够操纵并整合足够的始祖物质进入你的核心，从而满足并永远平息呼唤。”她顿了顿。“如果你还愿意的话。”_

_He looked back at the far-off entrance to Lilith's chamber. Unit-01 and Unit-02 stood guard, their backs to the two hovering Nephilim, keeping SEELE's Evas at bay. The sounds of battle were growing stronger, the thunderous clangs and crashes of Evas in close combat eerily mixed with the unnatural roars and shrieks of the Mass Production Series.  
他回头望向远处莉莉丝房间的入口。零一号机和零二号机守卫着，背对着悬浮的两名奈菲利姆，将 SEELE 的 EVA 挡在远处。战斗的声音越来越强，EVA 近身搏斗的雷鸣般撞击声与量产机型非自然的咆哮和尖叫诡异地混合在一起。_

_He turned back to Rei. "In the face of such trust, how can I do any less? Proceed, Rei. We will win, or I will die. Either way, you will all live, and I will no longer endanger those I have come to care for." He opened his white shirt, revealing his bare chest.  
他转回身面对丽。“面对如此信任，我怎能不尽全力？继续吧，丽。我们必将胜利，否则我便战死。无论如何，你们都将存活，我也不会再危及那些我已深切关怀的人。”他解开白色衬衫，露出赤裸的胸膛。_

_Rei just nodded, and floated closer to Lilith's form. As she drew near, a bulge in Lilith's stomach formed, reaching out for Rei. But the First Child halted it with a raised hand. "No," she told it, "not now, perhaps not ever. This world is alive. Give me what I require to ensure it remains so."  
丽只是点点头，飘近莉莉丝的形态。当她靠近时，莉莉丝腹部鼓起，伸向丽。但第一适格者举手制止了它。“不，”她对它说，“现在不行，也许永远都不行。这个世界充满生机。给我所需之物，确保它继续存在。”_

_The pseudopod of white flesh inched closer, narrowing. A sphere no larger than a plum formed at the tip and dropped into Rei's outstretched hand. The bulge then retreated, and Lilith's body was still once more.  
那白色的肉状触手缓缓靠近，逐渐变细。顶端形成一个李子大小的球体，落入丽伸出的手中。随后鼓起消退，莉莉丝的身体再次静止。_

_Rei flew back to Kaworu, holding her hand out in front of her. "Open wide, Kaworu. It is time for Tabris to go to sleep."  
丽飞回到薰身边，伸手向前。“张大嘴，薰。是时候让塔布里斯入睡了。”_

_The fragment of raw Progenitor screamed at him, the Call roaring in his ears, but it was wrong, wrong, not Adam, not-  
原始始祖的碎片在他耳边尖叫，呼唤声震耳欲聋，但不对，不对，不是亚当，不是——_

_Rei pressed it into his mouth, gently but unrelentingly. "If this causes you to explode, I apologize."  
丽轻轻但坚定地将它按进他的嘴里。“如果这让你爆炸了，我道歉。”_

_He swallowed it. 他咽了下去。_

_Rei's eyes flared like red stars, matching his own. She plunged her hand into his chest.  
丽的双眼如红星般闪耀，与他的目光相映成辉。她将手猛地插入他的胸膛。_

_He felt his AT-Field scream, twist, distort… and She was inside him. Filling him. Changing him. He felt his Lilithian and Adamite sides clash, mix… and meld, bridged by the pure piece of Progenitor she'd fed him, then guided into his Core with her own AT-Field.  
他感到自己的 AT 力场尖叫、扭曲、变形……而她已在他体内。充盈着他。改变着他。他感受到自己的莉莉丝与亚当之力相互冲突、交融……最终融合，由她喂给他的纯净始祖碎片所连接，再由她自身的 AT 力场引导进入他的核心。_

_For the first time in his existence, the Call faded, faded… and stopped.  
在他存在的第一次，那呼唤渐渐消退，消退……然后停止了。_

_Rei pulled her hand out of his chest, and laid it gently on his skin. Her touch still made his skin tingle, but not like before. "You have not exploded. Good. The Forbidden Union has been achieved. You are now safe from the Call."  
丽从他的胸膛中抽出手，轻轻地放在他的皮肤上。她的触摸仍让他感到皮肤发麻，但已不如从前。“你没有爆炸。很好。禁忌的结合已经达成。你现在已经不再受那呼唤的困扰。”_

_Kaworu smiled. The silence in his head was the sweetest music he'd ever heard. "Yes, I am. Now-"  
薰微笑了。他脑海中的寂静是他听过的最美妙的音乐。“是的，我自由了。现在——”_

_Rei grabbed his shoulders and slammed her lips against his.  
丽抓住他的肩膀，猛地将嘴唇贴了上去。_

_Eventually, she pulled back. "I have wanted to do that for weeks. That was even more pleasant than I expected. Now, let us go save our friends. We will discuss that more later."  
最终，她退开一步。“我已经想这么做好几个星期了。这比我想象的还要愉快。现在，让我们去救我们的朋友。这事我们稍后再详谈。”_

_"Guh." “呃。”_

_She honked his nose. "Focus, Fifth Child. We have a battle to win, and SEELE to crush. You and I have risked much to reach this point. The others have risked even more to let us have this chance. Let us go redeem their trust in us. And then enjoy the fruits of victory."  
她轻捏了一下他的鼻子。“集中精神，第五适格者。我们有一场战斗要赢，还有 SEELE 要摧毁。你我为了走到这一步冒了很大的风险。其他人为了给我们这个机会冒了更大的风险。让我们去回报他们对我们的信任。然后享受胜利的果实。”_

_He shook his head. "R-Right… trust. Thank you, Rei. For all of this."  
他摇了摇头。“好……信任。谢谢你，丽。为了这一切。”_

_"You may repay me later," Rei said, still as deadpan and cool as ever. "For now…" A pair of glowing octagons appeared at her hands, humming. "Let us go tear SEELE's Evas a structurally superfluous new behind."  
“你以后可以报答我，”丽说道，依旧面无表情，冷静如常。“现在……”她双手上浮现出两对发光的八角形，嗡嗡作响。“让我们去给 SEELE 的 EVA 们撕出一个结构上多余的新屁股。”_

_Two more AT-Fields appeared near Kaworu's hands. "Ladies first."  
又有两个 AT 力场在渚薰的手边出现。“女士优先。”_

_The two Nephilim rocketed towards Heaven's Gate, outbound and down.  
两位拿非利人疾速冲向天堂之门，向外飞驰而下。_

"I mean, she did kind of save my life and the world with that trick…" Kaworu rubbed his head. "So… I'm equally glad to be her husband too."  
"我的意思是，她用那个把戏救了我的命和整个世界……" 渚薰揉了揉头。"所以……我也同样高兴能成为她的丈夫。"

"Thank Shinji for the idea," Asuka muttered. That had been a… difficult day. But watching her two friends come flying out of Terminal Dogma to help them fight off SEELE's last five Mass Production Evas remained one of her favorite memories. "He is the one that thought it up. My baka can be a genius sometimes."  
"感谢真嗣的主意，" 明日香低声说道。那是个……艰难的日子。但看着她的两位朋友从终端教条飞奔而出，帮助他们击退 SEELE 最后五台量产 EVA，依然是她最喜欢的记忆之一。"是他想出来的。我的笨蛋有时候也能是个天才。"

"Now I'm your baka too," Kaworu grinned again. "And I can wait for you to say the words. I love you too, Asuka."  
"现在我也是你的笨蛋了，" 渚薰再次咧嘴笑道。"我会等你亲口说出那句话。我也爱你，明日香。"

She turned red, then purple. "Stop-... I… you… GAAAH! Stupid Fish!" Asuka pulled out of his grip. "Go get dressed, you distractingly naked man! Shinji! Rei! Where are you?" Asuka pushed open the door to the bathroom. "Have you found-"  
她的脸先是变红，接着变紫。"别-...我…你…啊啊啊！笨蛋鱼！" 明日香挣脱了他的手。"去穿衣服，你这个让人分心的裸男！真嗣！丽！你们在哪儿？" 明日香推开浴室的门。"你们找到了-"

The bear in the bathtub waved a quieting paw at her, warning her not to disturb the deeply embracing couple near the sinks. He raised his new bottle of vodka and took a long drink.  
浴缸里的熊轻轻挥动着安抚的爪子，警告她不要打扰在水池旁深情拥抱的情侣。他举起新开的伏特加酒瓶，喝了一大口。

Shinji couldn't answer Asuka's question. Rei had his tongue.  
真嗣无法回答明日香的问题。丽把他的舌头缠住了。

Asuka cleared her throat, subtly. Then not so subtly. "A_hem_. Rei, what are you doing? I thought you were just giving ah… Lieutenant Growlski some more vodka to keep him pacified, then coming back to help us search?"  
明日香轻咳了一声，先是微妙地，然后不那么微妙。“咳咳。丽，你在干什么？我以为你只是给……格罗尔斯基中尉再多倒些伏特加让他安静下来，然后回来帮我们搜索？”

Rei slowly broke the kiss, a very pleased smile on her face. She finally looked at Asuka. "I am doing science."  
丽缓缓结束了亲吻，脸上带着非常满意的微笑。她终于看向了明日香。“我在做科学研究。”

Asuka gave her a flat look. "Science."  
明日香给了她一个平淡的眼神。“科学。”

"I am experimentally verifying the question 'Is kissing your husband different from kissing your lover?' I am happy to report the answer is 'Yes, it is substantially better.'" Rei's eyes twinkled with anticipation. "I would now like to proceed with the next subject of investigation on the list, 'Is kissing your _wife_ different from kissing your lover?' Based on my experiments so far, I have high hopes for further positive results."  
“我正在实验验证一个问题：‘亲吻你的丈夫与亲吻你的情人有何不同？’我很高兴地报告，答案是‘是的，明显更好’。”绫波的眼中闪烁着期待的光芒。“现在，我想继续进行列表上的下一个研究课题：‘亲吻你的妻子与亲吻你的情人有何不同？’根据我迄今为止的实验，我对进一步的积极结果抱有很高的期望。”

Asuka bit her lip. Damn it. Rei's kisses were literally and figuratively divine, but is she let Rei get her hands on her, it would take them even longer to get out of the suite and start finding out some answers. "Um, Rei, I really do hate to say this, but we have to, uh… postpone that experimental series until _after_ we figure out exactly how we, ah… reached that status."  
明日香咬了咬嘴唇。该死。绫波的吻无论在字面上还是比喻上都是神圣的，但如果让她继续下去，他们离开套房并开始寻找答案的时间将会更长。“呃，绫波，我真的不想这么说，但我们必须……推迟那个实验系列，直到我们弄清楚我们究竟是如何……达到那个状态的。”

Rei's expression dimmed for a moment, but her lips curled back up into a small smile just as quickly. "Ah, I see. Yes. Well, as a good and obedient wife, I will of course obey my beloved's wishes."  
丽的眼神暗淡了一瞬，但她的嘴角很快又弯起了一个小小的微笑。“啊，我明白了。是的。好吧，作为一位贤惠顺从的妻子，我当然会遵从我亲爱的丈夫的意愿。”

"Glurk," Asuka replied. "I… damn it, you little minx…"  
“咕噜，”明日香回答道。“我……该死，你这个小妖精……”

Rei patted her on the cheek as she squeezed past Asuka. "Yes, dear. I will still hold you to your promise to help me into my clothes."  
丽轻轻拍了拍她的脸颊，从明日香身边挤过去。“是的，亲爱的。我仍然会要求你兑现帮我穿衣服的承诺。”

Some more cleaning and hotel suite archaeology unearthed their luggage and got the others dressed. Their cell phones turned up wrapped in aluminum foil in the freezer, for some reason. Misato and Kaji didn't answer theirs when called. There were several waiting text messages from her, all incoherent babble or random mashes of characters. The couple of voicemails were much the same. The last message was hours old, too. Giving up on that for a moment, Asuka shepherded her gaggle of hungover spouses out the suite door and down to the hotel lobby in search of possibly a taxi.  
再打扫一番，加上对酒店套房的“考古”，他们终于找到了行李，并帮其他人穿好了衣服。他们的手机不知为何用铝箔纸包着，放在冰箱里。Misato 和 Kaji 打电话时没有接听。她的几条未读短信全是语无伦次的胡言乱语或随机的字符组合。语音留言也差不多。最后一条信息也是几个小时前的了。暂时放弃联系他们，Asuka 带着一群宿醉的“配偶”走出了套房，下到酒店大堂，寻找可能的出租车。

Well, not so much shepherded as led from in front. Asuka did find some moderate amusement in realizing that all three of the hungover people behind her were probably staring at her arse. Or possibly her new tattoo. Either end pleased her ego in nice ways.. and a deeper part she was still hesitant to examine too closely just yet. It was too near the part that wanted to wildly freak out over waking up married to not just her intermittent boyfriend, but two additional friends as well.  
其实，与其说是带领，不如说是走在前面。Asuka 发现身后那三个宿醉的人可能都在盯着她的屁股，或者她新纹的纹身。无论是哪一头，都让她自我感觉良好，还有更深层次的感受，她暂时还不太敢细想。这离她醒来发现自己不仅和时好时坏的男友结了婚，还多了两个朋友作为伴侣的疯狂事实太近了。

Fortunately, she found a ready-made distraction waiting for them all once they cleared the elevators and reached the first floor, the bings and hubub of the casino floor filling the otherwise quiet lobby. Sitting at one of the tables spilling out of the restaurant just off the lobby's front hall was Hikari Horaki, looking very smug, and Touji Suzuhara, looking like he didn't know if he wanted to scream or start giggling madly.  
幸运的是，当他们穿过电梯到达一楼时，她发现了一个现成的干扰在等着他们所有人，赌场地板的叮当声和喧闹声填满了原本安静的大堂。坐在餐厅延伸至大堂前厅的一张桌子旁的是 Hikari Horaki，看起来非常得意，而 Touji Suzuhara 则一脸茫然，不知道自己是该尖叫还是开始疯狂地傻笑。

Asuka blinked in surprise as Hikari spotted them and waved them over. Her friend looked... different. Very different. Besides the cat-who-ate-100-canaries smile and the way she was radiating ALL THE SMUG. Hikari had maintained her girlish pigtails for a long time, even most of the way through high school. Even after they'd finally faded away, Hikari had always kept her hair tightly restrained in a severe ponytail. But now, for the first time any of them could recall, Hikari's brunette locks were unconfined, a glossy waterfall of rich chestnut hair spilling down all over her shoulders.  
当 Hikari 发现他们并挥手示意他们过去时，Asuka 惊讶地眨了眨眼。她的朋友看起来……不一样。非常不一样。除了那副吃了 100 只猫的得意笑容和她散发出的所有得意气息。Hikari 保持她少女般的双马尾很长时间，甚至大部分高中时期都是如此。即使它们最终消失了，Hikari 也总是把头发紧紧地束成一个严肃的马尾。但现在，他们中任何人能回忆起的第一次，Hikari 的棕色长发没有束缚，一头光泽的栗色头发如瀑布般倾泻在她的肩上。

"Hikari, good morning. You look, um... nice?" Shinji said, confused.  
“Hikari，早上好。你看起来，呃……不错？”Shinji 困惑地说。

"Ohhh, and I _feel_ even better, Shinji, thank you," Hikari said warmly. She took a slow, contented sip from her cup of coffee. "I feel great. I feel _unleashed_."  
"哦，我感觉更好了，真嗣，谢谢你，" 洞木光温暖地说道。她慢慢地、满足地啜了一口咖啡。"我感觉棒极了。我感觉自己被释放了。"

"Ah...why is that, Horaki-san?" Kaworu inquired.  
"啊...为什么会这样呢，洞木同学？" 渚薰询问道。

"Because my darling Touji and I are not stuck on third base anymore," she said smugly. "And it was _fantastic_!" She hummed a happy little tune to herself as she took another sip of her steaming coffee.  
"因为我亲爱的东治和我终于不再停留在三垒了，" 她得意地说。"而且那真是太棒了！" 她哼着一首愉快的小曲，又喝了一口热腾腾的咖啡。

"You did? Wait, what happened to 'no sex before marriage'?" Asuka said.  
"你真的做了？等等，那‘婚前不发生性行为’的原则呢？" 明日香说道。

Hikari did giggle this time. "Oh, don't you remember?" she said, shaking her head. "We did it! It's not Horaki anymore, that's why! It's _Suzuhara_, finally!"  
光这次真的笑了。"哦，你不记得了吗？" 她摇着头说，"我们结婚了！她不再是洞木了，所以才改姓铃原，终于！

"You got married last night?" Shinji asked.  
"你们昨晚结婚了？" 真嗣问道。

"Yup! You were all there! You don't remember either? You were my _husband's,_" Hikari trilled the word, "Best Man, Shinji! You were my Maid of Honor, Asuka!" Hikari seemed about to burst into laughter. "Well, I suppose we all _had_ been drinking a bit. That's how we went from a 'celebrate our engagement' party to 'hey, it's Vegas, let's get married right now!'" She laughed. "I am soooo happy Misato made that suggestion! Five years of waiting! I don't think Touji and I stopped until dawn!"  
"没错！你们都在场！你们也不记得了吗？你是我的丈夫的，"光用轻快的语调说出了这个词，"伴郎，真嗣！你是我的伴娘，明日香！"光似乎快要笑出声来。"嗯，我想我们都喝了不少。就这样从'庆祝我们的订婚'派对变成了'嘿，这里是拉斯维加斯，我们现在就结婚吧！'"她大笑着说。"我真是太高兴美里提出了那个建议！五年的等待！我想我和冬二一直闹到天亮！"

"Seems to have been a trend," Kaworu muttered quietly. Rei poked him in the side, smiling faintly.  
"似乎成了一种趋势，"渚低声嘀咕道。绫波轻轻戳了戳他的侧腰，微微一笑。

Asuka and Shinji shared a glance. _Yup, this was all Misato's fault_. "You look, ah... very happy, yes," Shinji said. He looked at his friend. "Uh... Touji looks... a bit more in shock."  
明日香和真嗣交换了一个眼神。没错，这都是美里的错。"你看起来，呃……非常开心，是的，"真嗣说。他看着他的朋友。"呃……冬二看起来……有点震惊。

Touji finally blinked. He'd been rather still, though the remaining crumbs of breakfast in front of him showed he'd definitely eaten quite an array of food from the buffet. His gaze slowly drifted to Shinji. "I... I'm definitely married... and I think I'm pregnant."  
真嗣终于眨了眨眼。他一直相当静止不动，尽管面前早餐剩下的碎屑表明他确实从自助餐中吃了不少食物。他的目光缓缓转向真嗣。“我……我肯定是结婚了……而且我觉得我怀孕了。”

Shinji stared back in confusion. "Ah... what?"  
真嗣困惑地回望着他。“啊……什么？”

"I am so pregnant..." Touji said vaguely. "I'm probably going to have triplets. Three little girls..."  
“我真的很怀孕了……”真嗣含糊地说。“我可能会生三胞胎。三个小女孩……”

"Touji, you're the _guy,"_ Shinji pointed out.  
"真嗣，你这家伙，" 真嗣指出来。

Touji shook his head. "Doesn't matter. Hikari screwed me into submission. I never had a chance. She wins, forever. I get to have the babies." He blinked again, a little more focus returning to his eyes. "Holy shit, I am so _married_." He smiled up at them.  
托基摇了摇头。"没关系。光把我吃得死死的。我从来没机会。她永远赢了。我得负责生孩子。" 他再次眨眼，眼神稍微恢复了些焦点。"我靠，我真是结婚了。" 他笑着抬头看他们。

"I _really_ wish we could remember last night," Asuka grumbled. "I knew this was Misato's fault."  
"我真的希望我们能记得昨晚的事，" 明日香抱怨道。"我就知道这是美里搞的鬼。"

Hikari looked at all of them. "None of you remember? Wow."  
光看着他们所有人。“你们都不记得了？哇。”

"We do not, Hikari, no," Rei said quietly. "You do? Can you tell us more? There have been... developments that we urgently desire more information about."  
“我们不记得，光，不记得，”丽轻声说。“你记得？能告诉我们更多吗？有些……发展，我们迫切需要更多信息。”

"Like what?" "比如什么？"

"Er," Shinji said. He took Asuka's hand and raised it. "I think your impulse put an idea in our heads. We seem to have gotten married too."  
“呃，”真嗣说。他握住明日香的手并举起来。“我觉得你的冲动在我们脑海中种下了想法。我们似乎也结婚了。”

Hikari's eyes widened. "What, you got married _too_? Without me there?! Asuka, I've been waiting for you two to stop playing games and get together for good for five years, and you're telling me I _missed_ it?" She hesitated, lips pursing in thought. "Ok, I guess some of that is my fault. Touji and I _did_ leave the instant we could, and we left you all there. I _know_ the idea was in the air, since Misato wouldn't stop making jokes. And we were just a _little_ tipsy..."  
光的眼中闪过一丝惊讶。“什么，你也结婚了？没等我到场？！明日香，我等你们俩不再玩游戏，真正走到一起已经等了五年，你现在告诉我我错过了？”她犹豫了一下，嘴唇紧抿，陷入沉思。“好吧，我想这多少是我的错。我和冬二一有机会就离开了，把你们留在那里。我知道这想法一直萦绕在大家心头，毕竟美里一直不停地开这种玩笑。而且我们当时只是有点微醺……”

"Hikari, we were all so blind drunk none of us can remember anything. I think that's a bit more than 'tipsy'," Asuka said dryly.  
“光，我们当时都醉得不省人事，谁也记不清发生了什么。我觉得这可不仅仅是‘微醺’。”明日香干巴巴地说道。

"Good thing the staff there didn't notice or say anything!" Hikari giggled. "Once Misato pointed out we could be married before midnight, it sounded so wonderful neither of us could stand waiting any longer." She sighed happily. "And it is. I'm so sad I missed you two getting married, though! I've been waiting for that to happen since we were fifteen! Everyone could see it! I'm so happy for you two!"  
“好在那里的工作人员没注意到也没说什么！”光咯咯笑道，“一旦美里指出我们可以在午夜前结婚，这主意听起来太美妙了，我们俩都等不及了。”她幸福地叹了口气，“而且确实很美好。不过我真遗憾错过了你们俩的婚礼！我从十五岁起就在等这一天了！大家都看得出来！我真为你们俩高兴！”

"Four," Rei said. “四。”丽说。

Rei's soft statement was lost in Hikari's tsunami of romantic cheer. Hikari put a thoughtful hand on her chin. "Well," she began, "Since I wasn't there, I'm guessing Rei was your Maid of Honor, Kaworu was Shinji's Best Man, and Kaji gave away the bride?"  
丽轻柔的话语淹没在光子的浪漫欢呼浪潮中。光子若有所思地托着下巴。“嗯，”她开口道，“既然我当时不在场，我猜丽是你的伴娘，薰是真嗣的伴郎，而加持把新娘交给了新郎？”

Kaworu snorted. "No, I was not the Best Man."  
薰嗤笑一声。“不，我不是伴郎。”

Hikari looked confused. "You weren't?"  
光看起来很困惑。“你不是吗？”

"No. I was the groom," he said, smiling despite still looking rather green around the gills.  
“不，我是新郎，”他笑着说，尽管脸色依旧有些苍白。

Hikari's confusion deepened. She looked at Touji.  
光的困惑加深了。她看向了斗司。

He shook his head. "Don't look at me, hon. You know exactly where I was. I'dda been proud to be Shin-man's Best Man, but..." Touji's brain finally caught up. He slowly wobbled his stare around to Kaworu. "Wait, you were the _groom_? I thought it was Shinji and Asuka that got married?"  
他摇了摇头。“别看着我，亲爱的。你明明知道我在哪儿。我本该自豪地成为真嗣的伴郎，但是……” 冬二的大脑终于跟上了节奏。他缓缓地将目光转向了渚薰。“等等，你是新郎？我以为结婚的是真嗣和明日香？”

"They did," Rei said, a little louder than before.  
“他们确实结婚了，” 绫波说，声音比之前稍微大了一些。

Kaworu raised his left hand. Beside him, Rei did too. Their matching rings sparkled.  
渚薰举起了他的左手。在他身旁，绫波也举起了手。他们手上的婚戒闪闪发光。

Hikari covered her mouth with both her hands, but still squeed loud enough to be heard anyway. "Ohmigod ohmigod ohmigod you had a _double wedding?!_ That's even _better_! You two are so cute together! I can't believe we missed all this! Did you get a video? Tell me there's a video!"  
光用双手捂住嘴，但仍然兴奋得大声尖叫，足以让人听见。“我的天啊，我的天啊，我的天啊，你们居然办了双重婚礼？！那更棒了！你们俩在一起太可爱了！真不敢相信我们错过了这一切！你们有录像吗？告诉我有录像！”

Asuka rubbed her face with her hands. Her head throbbed, and not just from the hangover. Explaining this to her best friend was hard enough. She couldn't _wait_ for all the fun it would likely entail to explain it to everyone else she knew. On the other hand, she was actually looking forward to explaining it to her faithless father and that slut he'd picked up before her mother was even in the ground. Scandalizing him with her own happy and lusty marriage sounded wickedly entertaining. She wasn't a filthy _cheater_. She was honest and sincere and needed them and was never going to lie to _any_ of them...  
明日香用手揉了揉脸。她的头在痛，不仅仅是因为宿醉。向她最好的朋友解释这一切已经够难了。她简直无法想象，向其他认识的人解释会带来多少乐趣。另一方面，她其实很期待向她那不忠的父亲和那个在他母亲还没下葬前就勾搭上的婊子解释。用自己幸福而充满激情的婚姻来震惊他，听起来真是邪恶的乐趣。她不是肮脏的骗子。她是诚实和真挚的，需要他们，永远不会对他们中的任何一个撒谎……

Wait, what was that? She shook her head. _Focus, Soryu._ "I... I hope there's a video, too. Some explanation for this would be nice. Since it's even more complicated than you think, Hikari."  
等等，那是什么？她摇了摇头。集中注意力，Soryu。“我……我也希望有录像。对此有个解释会很好。因为这比你想象的还要复杂，光。”

"Hmmm? How? I mean, I'm happy for all four of you."  
"嗯？怎么回事？我是说，我为你们四个都感到高兴。"

"We didn't have a double wedding. We had _one_."  
"我们没有举行双人婚礼。我们只办了一场。"

Hikari blinked at her. "I don't-"  
光眨了眨眼看着她。 "我不明白-"

Rei stepped up between Asuka and Shinji, pulling Kaworu along with her. Making sure he was tucked in right behind her, she let go of Kaworu long enough to snake one arm around Shinji's waist and lay her head on Asuka's shoulder. "_We_ got married," she declared softly but firmly, a tiny smile on her lips.  
丽走到明日香和真嗣之间，顺手拉着薰一起。确保薰紧贴在她身后，她松开薰的手，用一只胳膊环住真嗣的腰，头靠在明日香的肩上。“我们结婚了，”她轻声但坚定地宣布，嘴角挂着一丝微笑。

All four of them held up their left hands.  
他们四人都举起了左手。

Hikari's eyes bugged out. "You got... wait, _all four of you_? Together?! How the Hell did that happen?"  
光的眼珠子都快瞪出来了。“你们……等等，你们四个？一起？！这到底是怎么发生的？”

"We were hoping you could tell us," Kaworu said. "None of us remember even leaving this hotel. The working theory is that this is all Misato's fault somehow. What you've told us seems to bear that out."  
"我们希望你能告诉我们，" 渚说。"我们谁也不记得离开过这家酒店。目前的推测是，这一切都是美里造成的。你告诉我们的情况似乎证实了这一点。"

"It, ah... I guess it is?" Hikari visibly struggled to collect her wits. "I can't believe all _four_ of... um, alright. Well, we were all here, drinking, having a wonderful time, when um... Touji and I got a little excited. I mean, yes, we'd been planning this official engagement for almost two years, but really having it _happen_ was... we couldn't help it. I told Touji I hated the wait. Misato said I 'needed to get fucked, in the worst way', and when I told her that nothing was going to make me break my promise to my mother to wait until I was married, she pointed out this was a city famous for 24-hour no-waiting wedding chapels. It... sounded like the greatest idea ever, at that point."  
"嗯，啊... 我想是的？" 光子明显在努力集中思绪。"我简直不敢相信我们四个... 呃，好吧。我们当时都在这里，喝酒，玩得很开心，然后... 我和冬二有点兴奋。我是说，虽然我们计划这场正式订婚已经快两年了，但真正发生时... 我们控制不住。我告诉冬二我讨厌等待。美里说我'急需被狠狠地干一回'，当我告诉她我不会违背对母亲的承诺，婚前不会发生关系时，她指出这是一座以 24 小时无需等待的婚礼教堂闻名的城市。那时... 听起来简直是绝妙的主意。"

"I think it was the 'Romulan Ale' Misato had us all drinking," Touji mumbled. "I think that stuff was _powerful_. I think I would have agreed to just about anything at that point, as long as Hikari kept kissing me. I dunno what was in that stuff, but once we started drinking that, everything got reeeeeally fuzzy."  
"我觉得是美里让我们喝的那种‘罗慕兰酒’，" 托基含糊地说。"我觉得那玩意儿劲儿很大。我想我当时什么都愿意答应，只要光继续吻我。我不知道那里面有什么，但一旦我们开始喝那个，一切都变得非常模糊。"

"So I said 'let's go!' And we all went! We found a jewelry store a few kilometers away, hit the downtown county office for the license, found the chapel a few kilometers on, and Misato organized us into a wedding party!" Hikari giggle again. "And ta-daaaa, one hour later I was _Mrs. Hikari Suzuhara_!"  
"所以我喊了声‘走吧！’然后我们就都去了！我们找到了几公里外的一家珠宝店，冲到市中心的县政府办公室领了证，又往前几公里找到了教堂，美里帮我们组织了一场婚礼！" 光再次咯咯笑道。"然后，哒哒哒，一小时后我就成了铃原光！"

"So how does that explain us?" Shinji asked.  
"那我们俩呢？" 真嗣问道。"

Hikari shook her head. "I have no idea. You were all still single when I left! Touji and I departed right after the official said 'man and wife', because I have been waiting _five damn years_ to be properly married so I can finally fuck my husband, and I was not waiting one second more than I had to." Her eyes went misty. "_So_ worth it."  
光摇了摇头。“我完全不知道。我离开时你们都还是单身！我和阿斗在牧师说完‘夫妻对拜’后立刻就离开了，因为我已经等了整整五年才正式结婚，终于可以和我的丈夫好好亲热了，我一分钟也不想多等。”她的眼眶湿润了。“这一切都太值得了。”

"Was Misato-san still there with us too, when you left us?" Shinji asked.  
“美里小姐当时也和我们在一起吗？”真嗣问道。

"Yes, she and Kaji were there, laughing and cheering the whole time."  
“是的，她和加持也在那里，全程都在笑闹和欢呼。”

"Was this the establishment, Hikari?" Rei said, producing their sheaf of marriage certificates and receipts from her handbag.  
“这里是登记处吗，光？”丽从手提包里拿出他们的结婚证书和收据问道。

Hikari took them and shook her head in amazement. "Yes, this is it. The Chapel of the Flowers. We used the Crystal Gardens chapel." She handed Rei back the papers. "I take it you're heading there now to... find out what happened?"  
光接过证书，惊叹地摇了摇头。“是的，就是这里。花之礼拜堂。我们用的是水晶花园礼拜堂。”她把文件还给丽。“我想你现在是要去那里……弄清楚发生了什么吧？”

Rei nodded. "Yes. We will have to be circumspect, however. If the Chapel staff become convinced we were intoxicated beyond ability to remember at the time they performed the ceremony, they may be forced to determine it was invalid," she said calmly. Her voice hardened. "I do not wish this to happen."  
丽点点头。“是的。但我们必须谨慎行事。如果礼拜堂的工作人员认为我们当时醉得无法记事，他们可能会被迫判定仪式无效，”她平静地说道。她的语气变得坚定。“我不希望这种情况发生。”

Touji rubbed his eyes. "You... want to have this be a thing? I mean, you're not going to, uh... fix it?"  
冬二揉了揉眼睛。“你……想让这成为一件事情吗？我是说，你不会去，呃……修复它吗？”

Rei tapped one slender finger on the tattoo under her eye. "No. I have been marked and claimed and held, as have they. We are bound, hearts and souls, by love and by will until the end of us all." She looked contemplative for a moment. "Also, I do not wish to give up the pleasure of Shinji's _enormous_ co-"  
丽用她纤细的手指轻敲着眼下的纹身。“不。我已被标记、被宣称、被拥有，他们也是如此。我们因爱与意志，心与灵魂，被紧紧束缚，直到我们所有人的尽头。”她沉思了一会儿。“而且，我不想放弃享受真嗣巨大同情心的乐趣——”

Kaworu clamped a hand over Rei's mouth. "Compassion. She was going to say compassion," he improvised.  
薰迅速用手捂住了丽的嘴。“她想说同情心，”他即兴补充道。

Rei pried his hand away. "Kaworu's too." She too looked smug.  
丽将他的手推开。“卡罗也太。”她看起来也很得意。

"We're not 'fixing' anything for at least 96 hours after the fact," Asuka pointed out. "No divorces or annulments allowed in that time frame, according to the same current law that even allows for the four of us to be married in the first place."  
“我们至少在事情发生后 96 小时内不会‘修复’任何事情，”明日香指出。“根据现行法律，不允许在这段时间内离婚或取消婚姻，该法律甚至允许我们四个人首先结婚。”

"But we fly back to Japan in-" Hikari started to say.  
“但我们飞回日本——”光希开始说道。

"We _know_," Asuka cut her off. "And that's without touching on the fact we still don't know what the Hell we were thinking, or how," she looked at Rei, who was now snuggling up against Kaworu's chest, still smiling smugly, "opinions are divided on if we even _want_ to... 'fix this'. And as Rei pointed out, we've all got each others' names tattooed all over us."  
"我们知道，" 明日香打断了她。"而且这还没提到我们仍然不知道当时我们到底在想什么，或者怎么想的，" 她看向绫波，后者正依偎在渚薰的胸前，依旧得意地笑着，"至于我们是否还想'修复这一切'，意见也分歧。正如绫波所说，我们每个人身上都纹着彼此的名字。"

"What, really? All of you?"  
"什么，真的吗？你们所有人？"

Asuka felt dainty, familiar hands take her by the shoulders and turn her around, putting her back to Hikari. Rei's hand then grabbed Asuka's shirt at her beltline and pulled it up. "Yes," Rei said, "Observe. Is it not beautiful? Shinji and Kaworu's are over their hearts."  
明日香感觉到熟悉而娇小的手抓住她的肩膀，将她转过身来，背对着光。绫波的手随后抓住明日香腰带处的衬衫，向上拉起。"是的，" 绫波说，"看吧。不是很美吗？真嗣和渚薰的名字在他们的心口上。"

"Rei!" Asuka tugged her shirt back down and spun back around to hide her back. "Don't just go flashing me at Hikari, her gorilla, and everyone else in the lobby!"  
"丽！" 明日香拉下她的衬衫，迅速转过身去隐藏自己的背部。"别就这样在光、她的猩猩，还有大厅里的所有人面前炫耀给我看！"

Rei did manage to look contrite. "I am sorry, Asuka," she said apologetically. I am just giddy at the prospect of showing off our marks to everyone. You are all mine." She turned Asuka's head enough to kiss her softly. "As I am yours."  
丽确实露出了悔意。"我很抱歉，明日香，"她歉意地说道。"我只是对向大家展示我们的痕迹感到兴奋。你们都是我的。"她轻轻地转过明日香的头，温柔地吻了她一下。"正如我是你的。"

"Gleeble!" Asuka protested.  
"格利布尔！" 明日香抗议道。

"Wow... I... I didn't know you were _that_ close, Asuka," Hikari said, flushing red.  
“哇...我...我不知道你们这么亲密，明日香。” 美里说，脸颊泛红。

"The Red Demon and Rei Ayanami are kissing. I think being married has affected my brain," Touji said vaguely. His eyes glazed over again. "Hikari, can we go back upstairs and be married again some more?"  
“红魔和绫波丽在接吻。我觉得结婚已经影响我的大脑了，” 冬二含糊地说道。他的眼神再次变得呆滞。“美里，我们能回楼上再结一次婚吗？”

"I... maybe we should go with them? I mean, we didn't get our video either," Hikari said. "Either way, I'm going to have to lean on you. After last night, my legs are more wobbly than flan in an earthquake."  
“我...也许我们应该跟他们一起去？我是说，我们也没拿到录像，” 美里说。“不管怎样，我得靠着你了。经过昨晚，我的腿比地震中的布丁还软。”

"How did you get down here, if so?" Kaworu inquired.  
"你是怎么下来的呢？" 渚薰询问道。

Hikari smugged again. "My strong and virile husband carried me down from our room for breakfast. _Bridal carry_, in fact."  
光再次得意地笑了。"我那强壮有力的丈夫从我们的房间把我抱下来吃早餐。实际上是公主抱。"

"Hikari is cuddly," Touji nodded. He smiled agreeably at everyone.  
"光很可爱，" 冬二点头道。他愉快地向大家微笑。

"I think you literally fucked his brains out, Hikari," Asuka smirked.  
"我觉得你简直是把他脑子都搞飞了，光莉，" 明日香带着一丝嘲讽地笑道。

"Don't need brains. Being married is awesome. I am so pregnant," Touji... argued?  
"不需要脑子。结婚真是太棒了。我怀孕了，" 冬二...争辩道？

"Touji, buddy, I assure you, you're not pregnant," Shinji tried. "You are anatomically ill-equipped."  
"冬二，兄弟，我向你保证，你没有怀孕，" 真嗣尝试解释。"你的生理结构不允许。"

"Then we'll have to try harder. I want Hikari's babies."  
"那我们就得更努力了。我想要光的孩子。"

Kaworu patted Shinji on the shoulder. "I think he's still in shock, Shinji. Just let him be happy. It's not as if we all don't feel nearly as, ah... unmoored from our normal states of mind this morning, no?"  
渚薰拍了拍真嗣的肩膀。“我想他还处于震惊中，真嗣。就让他快乐吧。我们今天早上不也都几乎感到，呃……与平常心境脱节了吗，不是吗？”

"I... guess? I don't know. I feel weirdly... at ease," Shinji said, covering Kaworu's hand with his own. "Because I've got you, Rei, and Asuka, I think. I'd be flailing all over if I didn't."  
“我……大概吧？我不知道。我感到奇怪地……平静，”真嗣说，用自己的手覆盖住渚薰的手。“因为有了你、绫波和明日香，我想。如果没有你们，我早就手足无措了。”

Kaworu smiled back and started to lean in for a kiss. He hesitated at the last moment, looking the question at Shinji if it was ok to do this in public.  
渚薰回以微笑，开始倾身向前准备接吻。但在最后一刻他犹豫了，用眼神询问真嗣是否在公共场合这样做合适。

"_Gott_, you two are so cute..." Asuka murmured. "I mean, ahem! Let's get a taxi and go find out what happened! We've got a mystery to solve, Misato to track down, and then we blame her for all of this mess." She paused. "Finish that kiss first, though." She coughed into her hand. "Please."  
“天哪，你们俩真是太可爱了……”明日香喃喃道。“我是说，咳咳！我们赶紧打个出租车去找出发生了什么吧！我们有谜团要解，美里要追踪，然后我们把这一切混乱都归咎于她。”她顿了顿。“不过，先完成那个吻。”她用手掩嘴轻咳一声。“请吧。”

As Shinji and Kaworu happily obliged her, Rei turned to Hikari. "You are taking our situation far more calmly than I feared you might, Hikari. I was concerned you would find our unorthodox status... objectionable. You do have a bit of a reputation about strictness over 'traditional values'."  
当真嗣和渚薰欣然应允时，绫波转向光。“你对我们这种情况的接受程度远比我预想的要平静，光。我曾担心你会觉得我们这种非正统的状态……难以接受。你在‘传统价值观’方面的严格可是有些名声的。”

"You mean I was a raging prude who once blew up at the impropriety of Shinji and Asuka merely living together?" Hikari smiled. "Well, two things, Rei. First, however weird it might be, you're all as married at Touji and I, and that covers a lot of 'sin'. Second, I am so mellow right now I'm nearly Zen. I might get more uptight about it later when I come down, but I promise I'll try not to. But right now, I am _fine_."  
"你是说我曾经是个暴怒的保守派，仅仅因为真嗣和明日香同居就大发雷霆？" 光微笑着说，"好吧，有两件事，丽。首先，不管多奇怪，你们都像我和斗志一样结婚了，这掩盖了很多'罪'。其次，我现在非常放松，几乎达到了禅的境界。以后我可能会对此更加紧张，但我会尽量不这样。但现在，我很好。"

She finished the last of her coffee and patted Touji on the hand. "I think you'll have to carry me to the taxi stand, dear. Let's go help them find out what happened to them last night after we left."  
她喝完了最后一口咖啡，轻轻拍了拍斗志的手。"亲爱的，我想你得把我抱到出租车站了。我们走吧，去帮他们弄清楚昨晚我们离开后发生了什么。"

"I'm glad you talked me into that minivan for our rental, Kaworu."  
“我很高兴你劝我租了那辆小型货车，薰。”

"I knew we'd need the space, Shinji," Kaworu smiled. He bit his lip for a moment, then sidled a little closer to Shinji and took his hand as they walked.  
“我就知道我们需要这个空间，真嗣，”薰微笑着说。他咬了咬嘴唇，然后稍微靠近真嗣，牵起了他的手一起走。

Shinji jumped slightly, but quickly relaxed. No one was really staring at the two young men walking hand-in-hand through the nicely air-conditioned lobby of the hotel-casino as they headed for the parking garage. Shinji started to sweat anyhow. "Kaworu?"  
真嗣微微一跳，但很快放松下来。没有人真正盯着这两个年轻人手牵手穿过酒店赌场那空气清新的前厅，朝停车场走去。真嗣还是开始冒汗了。“薰？”

"I... want to... show off," Kaworu replied haltingly. "I am still confused as to how this came about, but I am... happy? I... Shinji, you know I have... loved you since I arrived, yes? But... anyone could see you and Asuka were something only a fool would interrupt. So I didn't. But... the idea that I could be _added_ to your pairing was... I wish I'd thought of it before. Beyond wild dreams, I mean."  
“我……想炫耀一下，”薰断断续续地回答。“我仍然困惑这是怎么发生的，但我……很高兴？我……真嗣，你知道我从来到这里就……爱着你，对吧？但是……任何人都能看出你和明日香是那种只有傻瓜才会打扰的关系。所以我没这么做。但是……想到我可能会加入你们的组合……我真希望我早点想到。我是说，这超出了我狂野的梦想。”

Shinji tried not to blush too much. Kaworu's hand in his was warm and strong, the surprising strength of another musician's fingers easy to feel. "I... um... I kind of noticed, yeah. How you... liked me. You know how I'm... bad at... _believing_ that, though. Asuka had to practically tackle me to the floor the first time we... er... got serious. And I wasn't much better with Rei. You... come on, a third person who liked me? And... it took nearly a straight liter of sake before I could admit I wanted to kiss you, remember? If Asuka hadn't dared me to, I probably would still have chickened out."  
真嗣尽量不让自己脸红得太厉害。渚薰握着他的手温暖而有力，另一位音乐家手指间出乎意料的力量轻易就能感受到。“我……嗯……我有点注意到，是的。你……喜欢我。你知道我……不擅长……相信这一点。第一次我们……呃……认真起来时，明日香几乎要把我扑倒在地。和绫波在一起时我也没好到哪儿去。你……来吧，第三个喜欢我的人？而且……我喝了将近一升清酒才敢承认我想吻你，记得吗？如果不是明日香激我，我可能到现在还不敢呢。”

"I'm glad you did not..." Kaworu's smile was _almost_ perfectly innocent. Only someone who'd known him for years could spot the wicked edge to it. "I found Rei was right. Kissing someone you love is... different. And sex even more so."  
“我很高兴你没有……”渚薰的微笑几乎完美无瑕。只有认识他多年的人才能察觉到其中一丝邪恶的边缘。“我发现绫波是对的。亲吻你所爱的人是……不同的。而性爱更是如此。”

Shinji did blush this time. It had taken a couple of years of intermittent intimacy before he'd even admitted to Asuka alone that he found men attractive too. Or at least Kaworu. He'd never felt too much pull towards other men. Not like the one he'd felt for his gray-haired friend, anyway. Asuka, happily, had found the news more arousing than shameful, the latter being something he'd feared. She'd happily bragged about Europe's 'more enlightened' attitude about it. Shinji had rebutted with a simple look in the direction of Asuka's surprisingly extensive collection of _Japanese_ yaoi manga. She'd retaliated by grabbing a hold of his groin and starting to whisper how she'd like to see him and Kaworu together, and the discussion had wandered from there. Still, actually acting on the attraction, or admitting it to anyone else had waited until that very drunken birthday party last year. He'd never minded that Asuka and Rei had always been there when they did, eagerly watching and cheering.  
这次，真嗣确实脸红了。他花了好几年断断续续的亲密时光，才向明日香一个人承认，他也觉得男人有吸引力。或者说，至少是觉得薰有吸引力。他对其他男人从未有过如此强烈的感受，至少不像他对那位灰发朋友那样。幸运的是，明日香听到这个消息后，更多的是感到兴奋而非羞耻，后者是他曾担心的情况。她兴高采烈地吹嘘欧洲对此的“更为开明”态度。真嗣则用一个简单的眼神指向明日香那令人惊讶的日本耽美漫画收藏，作为反驳。她随即反击，抓住他的下体，开始低声细语她想看他和薰在一起的情景，话题便由此展开。尽管如此，真正付诸行动或向他人承认这份吸引力，一直等到去年那场酩酊大醉的生日派对。他从不介意明日香和丽在他们身边，热切地观看和欢呼。

Hell, both girls had been firmly encouraging. Everyone knew Rei was a considerable voyeur, but Asuka... she'd been whispering in his ear the entire time he and Kaworu had first... gone further. Whispering how hot she found it... but also whispering encouragement. _Emotional_ encouragement. Telling him not to be afraid of admitting you liked someone, not to fear showing it, that she and Rei would never mock him for it.  
见鬼，两个女孩都坚定地鼓励着他。大家都知道丽是个相当爱偷窥的人，但明日香... 在他和渚薰第一次... 更进一步的时候，她一直在他耳边低语。低语说她觉得这有多么火热... 但也低语着鼓励。情感上的鼓励。告诉他不要害怕承认自己喜欢某人，不要害怕表现出来，她和丽永远不会因此嘲笑他。

And yes, sex with Kaworu had been... as intense and exciting as he'd imagined. Asuka being there, whispering in his ear, had quieted his fears even more than the alcohol had numbed them. The morning after, waking up next to the man who'd done his best to be Shinji's friend from the day they met, despite the darker whispers of the Call, Shinji hadn't felt any of the shame or regret he'd feared. Only warmth that both Kaworu and Asuka had been as happy with the night as he was.  
没错，和渚薰的性爱... 正如他所想象的那样激烈和令人兴奋。明日香在那里，在他耳边低语，比酒精更能平息他的恐惧。第二天早上，醒来时身边是那个从见面第一天起就尽力成为真嗣朋友的人，尽管有更黑暗的召唤低语，真嗣没有感到任何他担心的羞耻或后悔。只有温暖，渚薰和明日香都像他一样享受那个夜晚。

Right up until Kaworu's weakness to hangovers had reared it's head, and he'd fled the room in haste for the bathroom. Kind of like this morning, really. ...Except for the part where Kaworu was now apparently his husband. That did start his legs trembling, and more sweat rolling down his temples than the mere heat of the Las Vegas sun on the parking garage could account for. Husband. And his _two_ wives were right behind them. He... was he _allowed_ to be this happy?  
直到卡罗尔对宿醉的弱点显现出来，他急忙冲向洗手间。就像今天早上一样。...除了卡罗尔现在显然成了他的丈夫这一部分。这确实让他的双腿颤抖，额头上流下的汗水比拉斯维加斯阳光照射在停车场上的热度还要多。丈夫。而他的两位妻子就在他们身后。他...他可以这么幸福吗？

That exact insecurity had cause more than one breakup between him and Asuka. Sometimes, the better things were going, the less Shinji felt like he was worth it, like Asuka could do better than him, and that always led to him withdrawing from her right when they were getting closer than ever, and ta-da, breakup again. Made worse each time by the way it was triggered by Asuka lowering her walls a bit more. She hated the way him doing that hurt her, he hated _himself_ for hurting her... There were reasons that they'd taken five years to reach this point, despite how much they loved each other.  
正是这种不安全感导致了他和明日香之间不止一次的分手。有时候，事情进展得越好，真嗣就越觉得自己不配，好像明日香可以找到比他更好的人，这总是让他在她离他越来越近的时候退缩，然后，分手再次发生。每次都因为明日香稍微放下一些防备而变得更糟。她讨厌他那样做伤害了她，他讨厌自己伤害了她...尽管他们彼此深爱，但正是这些原因让他们花了五年时间才走到这一步。

And now here he was, walking along holding his _husband's_ hand while his wives, plural, watched the two of them with smiles. He wondered if this was some attempt by his subconscious to 'go berserk' on its own and try to overload his insecurity until it surrendered. He wasn't sure if he deserved this, but it looked like Rei wanted it, Kaworu was content with it, and Asuka... She'd been overjoyed when he'd said 'I think we got married.' And he wanted her to be happy more than anything. Was their happiness with this enough to override his fears of reaching for it? They'd all four of them been the closest of friends and lovers for years. Could he... could he do this? For them?  
而现在，他正牵着丈夫的手漫步，他的妻子们，是的，不止一个，正微笑着注视着他们。他不禁怀疑这是否是他的潜意识在自行‘发狂’，试图通过加剧他的不安全感直到它屈服。他不确信自己是否配得上这一切，但似乎丽希望如此，薰对此感到满足，而明日香...当他说出‘我想我们结婚了’时，她欣喜若狂。他最希望的就是她能快乐。他们的幸福是否足以压倒他对追求这一切的恐惧？他们四人多年来一直是亲密无间的朋友和爱人。他...他能做到吗？为了他们？

He shook his head. Maybe the... gulp... wedding video would reveal some answers. The address wasn't far away. Even in Las Vegas Traffic, they'd be there quickly once they got in the...  
他摇了摇头。或许...咕噜...婚礼视频会揭示一些答案。地址并不远。即便在拉斯维加斯的交通中，一旦他们上了...

"Dude, where's my car?" “哥们，我的车呢？”

Kaworu looked at the empty parking spot in the vast garage. "Where's your car, dude?"  
渚薰望着空荡荡的车位，在宽敞的车库里问道：“你的车呢，伙计？”

"Dude, _where's my car?_" Shinji repeated.  
“伙计，我的车呢？”真嗣重复道。

"Shin-dude, the car is missing!" Touji belatedly observed. In his arms, Hikari looked around in confusion.  
“真-伙计，车不见了！”东治后知后觉地发现。在他怀里的光则困惑地环顾四周。

Their suite, for a small additional fee of course, came with a reserved parking spot in the attached parking structure, right near the elevators. The last Shinji could _remember_, they'd parked the nice, new-model Honda minivan right there the day before. Right now, however, the spot was entirely devoid of cars, trucks, minivans, limousines, or even scooters.  
他们的套房，当然要额外支付一小笔费用，附带一个预留的停车位，就在相连的停车楼里，紧挨着电梯。据真嗣最后记得的，他们昨天就把那辆崭新的本田新款小型货车停在了那里。然而现在，这个车位却空空如也，没有汽车，没有卡车，没有小型货车，没有豪华轿车，甚至连摩托车都没有。

"Shinji, where's the car?" Asuka joined in.  
“真嗣，车呢？”明日香也加入了询问。

"I... I have no idea. We left it here... last I can remember." Shinji dug the keys out of his pants pocket and tried clicking the fob. No locating beep returned.  
“我……我不知道。我们明明把它停在这里……我最后记得的是这样。”真嗣从裤袋里掏出钥匙，试着按下遥控器。没有传来定位的哔哔声。

Rei walked past them and examined the spot from close up. "Dude, there is no car."  
丽从他们身边走过，近距离检查了那个地方。“伙计，这里没有车。”

"Rei, since when do you use 'dude'? I expect that from the boys, not you," Asuka said wryly.  
“丽，你什么时候开始用‘伙计’这个词了？我以为这是男孩子们的专利，而不是你。”明日香带着一丝讽刺说道。

"I wanted to participate." She knelt down. "I believe I have data."  
“我想参与进来。”她跪了下来。“我相信我有数据。”

"Eh? What have you got, Rei?" Asuka walked over to see what Rei had picked up.  
“嗯？丽，你找到了什么？”明日香走过去看看丽捡起了什么。

"It appears we left ourselves a message as to the disposition of our vehicle, and left it pinned here under a small rock," Rei said calmly. She examined the small scrap of paper.  
“看来我们给自己留下了一条关于车辆去向的信息，并把它压在了一块小石头下，”丽平静地说。她仔细检查着那张小纸片。

Asukan looked over at Rei's shoulder at it. "It's... a drunken doodle of a car on top of a... house?" She looked at Kaworu and Shinji. "Ok, which one of you two drunken ninnies did this? I call 'not it'. And what the _flurgen_ is this supposed to tell us?"  
明日香从丽的肩膀上看过去。“这是一张……醉酒时画的汽车在……房子上？”她看向渚薰和真嗣。“好吧，你们两个醉鬼谁干的？我声明不是我。这到底想告诉我们什么？”

"We... parked the car on the roof?" Kaworu guessed.  
"我们...把车停在了屋顶上？" 渚薰猜测道。

"Why wouldn't we park it here?" Shinji asked.  
"为什么不能停在这里？" 真嗣反问。

Asuka held up the paper. There was indeed a sloppy, ball-point pen drawing of something that vaguely resembled a car sitting on the roof of a cartoonish rendering of a house, right down to a chimney with a little curlicue of smoke coming out of it. "This is all I'm working with, baka. You tell me. You've still got the keys. You were therefore probably the driver."  
明日香举起那张纸。确实有一幅潦草的圆珠笔画，画着一辆模糊类似汽车的物体停在卡通风格的房子屋顶上，甚至连烟囱里冒出的一小缕烟都画得惟妙惟肖。"这就是我所有的线索，笨蛋。你来解释。你还有车钥匙。所以你很可能就是司机。"

"Er... Shall we go to the roof deck and see if it's there?" Kaworu suggested.  
“呃……我们去顶楼看看它是否在那儿？”渚薰提议道。

For lack of a better idea, the group headed up the stairs to the top floor of the parking garage. There were few cars on the top deck while there were still spaces open lower down and in the shaded floors, but none of them proved to be the missing rented minivan.  
由于没有更好的主意，一行人爬上楼梯到达停车场的顶层。顶层的车很少，而下面几层和阴凉处还有空位，但这些都不是他们丢失的租来的小型货车。

Asuka surveyed the handful of non-minivans in sight with a frown. She spun around to glare lightly at Shinji. "No car. Next bright idea?"  
明日香皱着眉头打量着眼前为数不多的非小型货车。她转过身，轻轻瞪了真嗣一眼。“没车。下一个好主意呢？”

Shinji frowned back. "How should I know?" he grumbled. The hangover and the blazing sun overhead were making him irritable. "I may have the keys, but we can't remember getting _married_, which is just a little more significant than 'where did we park?', so I think not knowing how to interpret a drunken doodle is forgivable!" He held up the keys and clicked the fob again.  
真嗣皱着眉头回道：“我怎么知道？”他咕哝着，宿醉和头顶炽热的阳光让他烦躁不安。“我可能有钥匙，但我们连怎么结的婚都不记得了，这可比‘我们车停哪儿了？’重要多了，所以我觉得不知道怎么解读一个醉酒涂鸦是可以原谅的！”他举起钥匙，再次按下遥控器。

There was a very faint 'beep-beep' from far overhead.  
从高空远远传来一阵微弱的‘哔哔’声。

The quartet and the couple blinked at each other before slowly looking up in unison.  
四人组和那对情侣面面相觑，然后缓缓地齐齐抬头望去。

Far, far above them, the main tower of Caesar's Palace loomed over the parking garage. Shinji clicked the key fob once more, and was rewarded by another faint 'beep-beep' coming from the top.  
在他们上方极远之处，凯撒宫的主塔俯视着停车场。真嗣再次按下钥匙扣，随即从顶层传来了又一次微弱的‘哔哔’声。

"The car..." he said slowly.  
“那辆车……”他缓缓说道。

"...is on the roof," Asuka finished, equal disbelief in her voice.  
“……在屋顶上，”明日香接话道，语气中同样充满了难以置信。

"This was an excellent note," Rei observed. "Concise and accurate."  
“这是一张极好的纸条，”丽观察道，“简洁而准确。”

Kaworu rubbed his face with his hands. "Why did we... nevermind. I'll go take a look." There was a faint frisson of energy as he lightly flared his AT-Field, and he floated swiftly up into the air.  
渚薰用手揉了揉脸。“为什么我们……算了。我去看看。”他轻轻地展开 AT 力场，一股微弱的能量波动随之产生，他迅速飘向空中。

Once he was level with the roof of the casino, he took a look and shouted back down to them. "I found it. It's on the roof, alright. Hang on, I'll bring it down."  
当他与赌场的屋顶齐平时，他环顾四周并向下方喊道：“找到了。确实在屋顶上。稍等，我这就把它带下来。”

The Nephilim raised his hand towards the roof of the casino. A moment later their missing minivan appeared, floating gently through the air on another AT-Field. Kaworu drifted downward alongside it, letting it settle to the concrete of the parking garage with hardly a bounce.  
那名拿非利人将手伸向赌场的屋顶。片刻后，他们失踪的面包车便出现了，在另一个 AT 力场的支撑下，轻轻地飘浮在空中。渚薰伴随着它缓缓下降，让它几乎毫无颠簸地落在了停车场的混凝土地面上。

The other three stared at it. "Um..." Shinji said slowly. "Why..."  
其他三人盯着这一幕。"呃..." 真嗣缓缓开口，"为什么..."

"...is there a bear in the driver's seat?" Asuka finished again.  
"...驾驶座上会有一只熊？" 明日香再次接话道。

"Ah, good morning, Mrs. Growlski!" Rei said, in what passed for brightly from her.  
"啊，早上好，格罗尔斯基夫人！" 丽用她特有的方式欢快地说道。

The other three slowly shifted their stares to Rei. "Rei... how did you... 'Mrs. Growlski'?" Shinji asked.  
其他三人缓缓将目光转向丽。"丽...你怎么会...‘格罗尔斯基夫人’？" 真嗣问道。

"She's wearing the pink fez. That's how you tell them apart."  
"她戴着那顶粉红色的菲斯帽。这就是区分她们的方法。"

"Rei, how do you _know_ that?"  
"丽，你怎么知道的？"

"I don't know." "我不知道。"

"That just raises _further_ questions!" Kaworu protested.  
"那只会引发更多问题！" 渚抗议道。

The polar bear blinked awake and gave them all a suspicious squint. She rolled the window down and growled and harrumphed at them for a moment.  
北极熊眨了眨眼醒来，对他们投以怀疑的斜视。她摇下车窗，对他们咆哮和哼哼了一会儿。

"Yes, that's probably a good idea," Rei said. She turned to her spouses. "She's offering to do the driving if we're going somewhere, since she's betting we're all either still drunk or really hungover."  
"是的，这主意可能不错，"丽说。她转向她的配偶们。"她提出要开车，如果我们去什么地方的话，因为她赌我们全都还醉着或者宿醉严重。"

The wind blew a small tumbleweed across the garage's sunlit roof.  
风卷起一个小风滚草，吹过车库阳光照射的屋顶。

"Rei," Asuka said carefully, "Since when do you speak 'bear'?"  
"丽，"明日香小心翼翼地说，"你什么时候会说'熊语'了？"

Rei gave a tiny smile and shook her head. "I don't speak 'bear', Asuka. That would be silly. I speak decent Russian, though. And Lieutenant and Mrs. Growlski are from Siberia, of course." Rei walked over to the minivan, opened the passenger door, and got in. "I will sit up front and help navigate."  
丽微微一笑，摇了摇头。“我不会说‘熊语’，明日香。那太傻了。不过我的俄语说得还不错。格罗尔斯基中尉和夫人当然是来自西伯利亚。”丽走向小型货车，打开副驾驶门，坐了进去。“我坐前面帮忙导航。”

Shinji and Kaworu shared a glance. "When did you learn Russian?" Shinji asked.  
真嗣和薰交换了一个眼神。“你什么时候学的俄语？”真嗣问道。

"Last year. I developed a taste for numerous Russian porn sites, and available translations were poor or nonexistent." She pulled a pair of sunglasses out of the sun visor and put them on. She looked out at the rest. "I believe the appropriate quote here is 'get in, losers, we're going cruising.'" She waved at the back of the van.  
“去年。我迷上了好几个俄语色情网站，但可用的翻译要么质量差，要么根本不存在。”她从遮阳板里抽出一副太阳镜戴上。她向外看着其他人。“这里应该引用一句‘上车吧，失败者们，我们要去兜风了’。”她向货车后部挥了挥手。

"I guess that explains why Rei got really into vodka that year. This day just keeps getting stranger," Kaworu said, shaking his head. He opened the side door and got in the back row.  
“我想这解释了那年丽为什么对伏特加那么着迷。今天真是越来越奇怪了。” 渚摇着头说。他打开侧门，坐到了后排。

Asuka gave her friend an apologetic look. "I'm really sorry we can't remember your wedding, Hikari."  
明日香向她的朋友投去歉意的目光。“真的很抱歉我们不记得你的婚礼了，光。”

The brunette shrugged. "That's what the video is for, I suppose. And I'm pretty sure we're still going to do a traditional Japanese one once we're home, so our families can come. _I_ am sorry I missed yours entirely! I was expecting to be your maid of honor since about 2016! Well, me or Rei."  
棕发女孩耸了耸肩。“我想这就是录像的意义所在吧。而且我确信我们回家后还会再办一场传统的日本婚礼，这样我们的家人也能参加。很抱歉我完全错过了你的婚礼！我本以为从 2016 年起就会成为你的伴娘呢！嗯，要么是我，要么是丽。”

"Does it bother anyone else that the _polar bear_ is driving?" Shinji said worriedly.  
"北极熊在开车，这事儿有人觉得不对劲吗？" 真嗣担忧地说道。

"And where did she get the spare keys?" Touji added.  
"她是从哪儿弄来的备用钥匙？" 冬二补充道。

"Take the next left," Rei told the driver. She turned back to look at Shinji. "Better her than us, I think. You are all quite hungover, and I might still be slightly intoxicated."  
"下一个路口左转，" 丽对司机说。她转过头来看着真嗣。"我觉得她开车总比我们强。你们都宿醉未醒，而我可能还有点儿醉意。"

"This remains extremely unfair," Kaworu muttered. Even the mild motion of the car through traffic was making him look green and nauseous. "I always have the worst hangovers."  
"这仍然极其不公平，" 渚薰喃喃道。即便是车辆在交通中轻微的移动也让他看起来脸色发青，感到恶心。"我总是有最糟糕的宿醉。"

"Yes, but you are a very happy and snuggly drunk, and utterly amazing in bed when you're well lit," Rei replied without missing a beat, still totally deadpan. "Flexible, too."  
"是的，但你喝醉时非常快乐和黏人，而且当你状态好时在床上简直令人惊叹，" 绫波零毫不犹豫地回答，依旧面无表情。"还很灵活。"

Hikari covered her mouth, partly smothering a laugh. "Rei, I think you are still a little drunk. Your verbal filters go right out the window when you are, and you're sounding like that now."  
光捂住嘴，部分地压抑着笑声。"绫波，我觉得你还是有点醉。你喝醉时语言过滤器就完全失效了，现在听起来就是这样。"

"I'm also affected by the sheer emotional overload of the morning. I am quite giddy at the prospect of being married to the three people I love the most in the world, and have extensive, regular, and extremely fulfilling sexual encounters with in addition to less directly active periods of pure emotional intimacy. I am currently experiencing the most fascinating combination of arousal and romantic joy. I would prefer that this state last as long as possible."  
"我也被早晨的强烈情感冲击所影响。想到能与世界上我最爱的三个人结婚，并且除了纯粹情感亲密的非直接活跃期外，还能有广泛、规律且极其满足的性接触，我感到非常兴奋。我现在正经历着一种既兴奋又浪漫的奇妙结合。我希望能尽可能长久地保持这种状态。"

Hikari blinked. Rei had said all that with no change of tone or expression. "Um... good to hear, then? I take it you are, ah... one vote for staying married, and not trying to undo this?"  
光眨了眨眼。丽用同样的语气和表情说了这一切。“嗯...那很好，对吧？我猜你是...支持维持婚姻，而不是试图解除它？”

"Quite. I postulate that the tattoos may have been my idea, since they help underline the permanence."  
"确实如此。我推测纹身可能是我的主意，因为它们有助于强调永久性。"

"You sure? I mean..." Hikari looked at the others. "A.. four-way marriage? That... well, it might be legal here, but back home it's going to get a lot of funny looks."  
"你确定吗？我是说..." 光看着其他人。"四人婚姻？那...在这里可能是合法的，但在家乡会引来很多奇怪的目光。"

"I have blue hair, red eyes, am part space alien, and am already globally famous for my part in the Angel War and the defeat of SEELE. I submit to you that state of affairs makes any additional worries about being stared at moot."  
"我有蓝头发，红眼睛，部分是外星人，而且已经在全球因参与天使战争和击败 SEELE 而闻名。我认为这种情况使得任何关于被盯着看的担忧都变得无关紧要了。"

"...point," Hikari conceded. "I just... mostly figured it was going to be you and Kaworu one day, right along with Shinji and Asuka. Not... this."  
"...有道理，" 光承认道。"我只是...大多时候以为有一天会是你们和渚在一起，就像真嗣和明日香那样。而不是...这样。"

"I am happy. Among other things it means I do not have to cease sexual relations with any of them, or combinations thereof. I can continue this, and deepen the far more fulfilling emotional intimacy as well. I with to do this extensively with all of them."  
"我很高兴。这意味着我不必与他们中的任何一个或组合停止性关系。我可以继续这样做，并加深更为充实的情感亲密。我希望与他们所有人广泛地这样做。"

Shinji blushed. "Rei, filters..."  
真嗣脸红了。 "绫波，过滤器……"

"This marriage may be a surprise, but I am content. I do not wish to undo this. I love them all beyond my ability to verbally express, and have for some time, Hikari. While I may not be able to express it to my satisfaction, I wish to spend the rest of my life trying," Rei stated firmly.  
"这场婚姻虽然出乎意料，但我很满足。我不希望解除它。我对他们的爱超越了我用言语表达的能力，而且已经有一段时间了，光。虽然我可能无法充分表达，但我希望用余生去尝试，"绫波坚定地说道。"

Hikari opened and closed her mouth a few times. "Well," she said eventually. "I can kind of understand that feeling, I suppose." She looked at Touji and gave him a kiss.  
光打开又闭上了几次嘴巴。“嗯，”她最终说道，“我想我能稍微理解那种感觉。”她看着真嗣，给了他一个吻。

"Hee hee, babies," Touji mumbled happily, a goofy grin on his face. "What she said, too. Same for me."  
“嘻嘻，宝贝们，”真嗣开心地咕哝着，脸上挂着傻笑。“她说的也是。我也是这么想的。”

"I'm pretty sure you're not interested in sex with Kaworu, Touji," Asuka snarked. "Or even cuddling."  
“我很确定你对渚薰没性趣，真嗣，”明日香嘲讽道，“甚至连抱抱都不感兴趣。”

"Nope. Just Hikari. Lots and lots. So married. Mweee..."  
"不是的。只有光。很多很多。已经结婚了。喵呜..."

Mrs. Growlski harrumphed something more, pointing with one paw.  
葛罗尔斯基夫人哼了一声，用一只爪子指着。

"We are here," Rei interpreted.  
"我们到了，" 丽解释道。

Shinji was very grateful for the dark sunglasses he'd found in one of the minivan's pockets. Even with them, the ohgodsobrightithurrrrrrts sun made him wince badly as they all piled out on the parking lot in front of the Chapel of the Flowers. It did look vaguely familiar to Shinji's eyes. Obviously, if they'd been there last night and gotten married, according to the paperwork Asuka had in her hand, but it still felt weird to him that he could only get a hazy deja-vu feeling of having been there before when it was theoretically the site of the most important moment in his life since the day they'd averted Third Impact.  
真嗣非常感激他在面包车口袋里找到的那副深色太阳镜。即便戴着它们，那刺眼得要命的阳光还是让他痛苦地皱起了眉头，当他们一起走出停车场，来到花之教堂前时。那地方在真嗣眼里看起来有些模糊的熟悉感。显然，如果他们昨晚真的在那里结了婚，正如明日香手中的文件所证明的那样，但对他来说，这仍然感觉很奇怪，因为他只能隐约感觉到曾经来过这里的既视感，尽管从理论上讲，这是自他们阻止第三次冲击以来他生命中最重要的时刻。

Mrs. Growlski harrumphed and growled at Rei for a moment as she got out. Rei nodded and closed the passenger door. "Mrs. Growlski will stay here and keep the air conditioning going so the car is cool. She doesn't like Vegas' heat," she reported as they started to walk to the chapel's front entrance.  
格罗尔斯基夫人哼了一声，对绫波咆哮了一会儿，然后下了车。绫波点点头，关上了副驾驶的门。“格罗尔斯基夫人会留在这里，让空调继续运转，这样车子就能保持凉爽。她不喜欢拉斯维加斯的热浪。”她报告道，他们开始向教堂的前门走去。

Shinji and Kaworu shared a confused look before a simultaneous shrug as they fell in behind Rei and Asuka. Shinji put his arm around Kaworu as they went. His husband (!) still looked pretty green, and the sunlight and heat was hitting him even harder than it was Shinji. Kaworu gave him a grateful nod and a weak smile.  
真嗣和薰困惑地对视了一眼，随即同时耸了耸肩，跟在绫波和明日香身后。真嗣伸手揽住薰，他们一起走着。他的丈夫（！）脸色依旧苍白，阳光和热浪对他来说比对真嗣影响更大。薰感激地点头，露出一个虚弱的微笑。

Gods, that smile always made Shinji's stomach flutter. And the feeling of being able to put his arms around Kaworu _in public_... Shinji gulped as they went inside and the blissful cool of high-powered a/c washed over them.  
天啊，那个微笑总是让真嗣的心跳加速。能够在公共场合拥抱薰的感觉……真嗣咽了口唾沫，他们走进室内，强劲的空调带来的凉爽让他们感到无比幸福。

The woman at the counter looked up from her smartphone as the band of newlyweds approached. "Ah, hello, Mrs. Soryu-Ayanami! Great to have you and your spouses back so soon! You too, Mister and Misses Suzuhara. I'm betting you're here to pick up your videos? You all left in such a hurry last night, but I can understand why."  
柜台后的女士从智能手机上抬起头，看着这群新婚夫妇走近。“啊，你好，绫波-明日香太太！很高兴你们这么快就回来了！还有，铃原先生和太太。我猜你们是来取录像带的吧？昨晚你们走得那么匆忙，但我能理解为什么。”

Asuka blinked. She looked again at the papers in her hand. She'd glanced at them before they'd left, but mostly just to verify they were indeed their marital paperwork and to get the address of the chapel. She hadn't looked at the details. But yes, right there in black and white, was her new, legal name and those of her spouses: _Asuka Langley Soryu-Ayanami, wife: Rei Soryu-Ayanami, husband #1: Shinji Soryu-Ayanami, husband #2: Kaworu Soryu-Ayanami._  
明日香眨了眨眼。她再次看向手中的文件。出发前她只是匆匆扫了一眼，主要是确认这些确实是他们的婚姻文件，并获取了教堂的地址。她没有细看细节。但没错，白纸黑字上写着她新的法定名字以及配偶们的名字：惣流·明日香·兰格雷-绫波，妻子：绫波·惣流·绫波，丈夫#1：碇·惣流·绫波，丈夫#2：渚·惣流·绫波。

'They took my name? All of them? I...'  
'他们用了我的姓？全都用了？我...'

Asuka bit her lip and suppressed the urge to grab one or all of them and kiss their brains out. Or cry. But neither of those were something she could let herself do right now. They were in public. And... reasons. Yeah. She shook herself. _'Focus, Asuka.'_  
明日香咬了咬唇，强压下抓住他们中的一个或全部狂吻一番的冲动。或者哭泣。但这两种情绪她现在都不能表露出来。他们在公共场合。而且...有原因的。没错。她摇了摇头。'专注，明日香。'

"Ah... you can understand?" Asuka began. "You'll have to refresh us. I'm afraid there was just a _bit_ of celebratory drinking afterwards, so we're all kind of hung over and blurry on something we all really wish we we're crystal clear on."  
“啊……你能理解吗？”明日香开始说道，“你得帮我们回忆一下。恐怕是因为事后庆祝喝多了，我们现在都有点宿醉，对一些我们本该记得清清楚楚的事情感到模糊。”

The young blonde woman smiled and nodded. "Ma'am, I've worked here for five years, seen hundreds of weddings, but I don't think I've ever seen any couple or more come through here that was as... as _joyful_ as you and yours were, or more in love. That speech you gave to propose to them all was... I swear, we had at least three couples and one trio sign up to get married today because of your speech. It was the most moving and romantic thing any of us had ever heard. I kissed my husband so hard that night when I got home..."  
那位年轻的金发女子微笑着点点头。“女士，我在这里工作五年了，见过数百场婚礼，但我想我从没见过哪对情侣或更多人像你们这样……如此快乐，如此相爱。你那番求婚的演讲……我发誓，至少有三对情侣和一组三人因为你的演讲决定今天结婚。那是我们听过的最感人、最浪漫的事情。我那天晚上回家后，狠狠地亲了我的丈夫……”

Asuka stared at her. "What."  
明日香盯着她。“什么。”

The countergirl nodded, smiling broadly. "Actually, my manager said he wanted to talk to you when you came in to pick up the disc. He wanted to talk to you about seeing if we could use some of it in our marketing and advertising materials. We would compensate you and credit you, of course, but only if you wanted us to. We could anonymize it as well. We can understand if you want to avoid anyone making a fuss about your... unusual arrangement. Though you did um... shout to the entire parking lot 'HOLY SHIT, I'M MARRIED!' as you all left last night. Mrs. Suzuhara did too, come to think of it."  
柜台女孩点头微笑。“实际上，我的经理说当你来取光盘时他想和你谈谈。他想和你讨论是否可以将其中一些内容用于我们的营销和广告材料。当然，我们会补偿你并给你署名，但前提是你愿意。我们也可以匿名处理。如果你不想引起别人对你...特殊安排的注意，我们能理解。不过，你们昨晚离开时...对着整个停车场大喊‘天哪，我结婚了！’。铃原太太也是，想想看。”

"What." Asuka was still frozen.  
“什么。”明日香仍然僵在原地。

Shinji slid up next to Asuka and took her hand, massaging the back of it with his thumb. "Er... that's um... very kind of you, but could we see the video first? We're not really in shape for ah... detailed negotiations right now," he said to the woman.  
真嗣滑到明日香身边，握住她的手，用拇指按摩她的手背。“呃...你们真是太好了，但我们能先看看视频吗？我们现在不太适合...进行详细的谈判，”他对那位女士说。

"Oh! I'm sorry Mister Soryu-Ayanami! Yes, of course. I'm terribly sorry. We're all just... very excited by it. To tell the truth, the staff have been watching it over and over again this morning, showing it the morning staff who weren't here last night to see it. Please, follow me. I'll take you right to the video department."  
"哦！对不起，索吕-绫波先生！当然，非常抱歉。我们只是……对此非常兴奋。说实话，今天早上工作人员一直在反复观看，给那些昨晚不在的早班员工展示。请跟我来，我会直接带您去视频部门。"

She walked out from behind the counter and gestured for them all to follow her down the hall to the right.  
她从柜台后走出来，示意他们所有人都跟着她沿着走廊向右走。

"Asuka, what did you _say_?" Hikari hissed in her ear as they followed.  
"明日香，你说了什么？" 他们跟着走时，光在她的耳边低声问道。"

"I... I don't _know_!" Asuka finally managed, snapping out of her shock. "You don't remember?"  
"我...我不知道！" 明日香终于回过神来，脱口而出。"你不记得了吗？"

Hikari shook her head. "We were pretty drunk too, but I don't remember you making any speeches before Touji and I left, so it must have been after that."  
光摇了摇头。"我们当时也喝得挺醉的，但我记得你没在我们离开前发表什么演讲，所以应该是那之后的事。"

"Were Commander Katsuragi and Inspector Kaji still here? Would they know?" Kaworu asked.  
"葛城司令和加持 Inspector 还在吗？他们会知道吗？" 渚薰问道。"

"It was probably her _fault_," Asuka muttered. "And it doesn't matter if they know or not. We're about to see it for ourselves anyway."  
"这大概得怪她，" 明日香嘀咕道。"不管他们知不知道，反正我们马上就要亲眼看到了。"

"I just want to know how much to thank them or blame them," Kaworu replied.  
"我只是想知道该感谢他们多少，还是该责怪他们多少，" 渚薰回答道。"

"Thank. Definitely thank," Rei said softly, smiling faintly.  
"感谢。绝对是感谢，" 绫波丽轻声说道，微微一笑。"

Shinji let go of Asuka's hand and pondered the idea himself as they walked. How did he feel about all this, really? Misato _had_ been encouraging of him and Asuka as a pair, and more than once been Shinji's shoulder to cry on when he'd fucked things up and caused another temporary break-up with her. Especially the first bad one, where Shinji had been afraid that was it forever. Misato had been the one to reassure him Asuka loved him back just as much as he loved her, just that they were both bad at communicating it. She'd been the one to give him the courage to try again.  
真嗣松开了明日香的手，边走边自己思考这个问题。他到底是怎么看待这一切的呢？美里一直鼓励他和明日香在一起，而且在他搞砸事情导致和明日香短暂分手时，多次成为他的倾诉对象。特别是第一次严重的分手，当时真嗣害怕那会是永远的结束。美里是那个安慰他明日香同样深爱着他的人，只是他们都不擅长表达。她给了他再次尝试的勇气。

And now here he was. _Married_. To not just Asuka, but Rei and Kaworu as well. The three people in the world who had _said_ they loved him. That Asuka had been half-drunk, fully nude, lying on top of him, and blushing as red as her hair when she mumbled, then shouted it at him had only made him even more sure she was telling the truth. That Rei and Kaworu had said it more softly and sweetly as they held him on their own occasions had been very... them.  
而现在，他就在这里。结婚了。不仅是和明日香，还有丽和薰。世界上那三个说爱他的人。明日香当时半醉半醒，全身赤裸地躺在他身上，脸红得像她的头发一样，先是喃喃自语，然后大声对他喊出那句话，这让他更加确信她说的是真话。而丽和薰在各自的时刻温柔甜蜜地对他说出那句话，非常符合他们的风格。

_'Huh. In fact, all three of them said that to me while we were all naked, buzzed, and post-coital. And we got married nearly the same way. My love life is as deep and wild as it is partly thanks to alcohol. I think I can blame-slash-thank Misato for that one too,'_ he mused. His eyes were almost automatically drawn to the three backsides walking in front of him. They were all gorgeous, from Asuka's stunning, toned one to Rei's smooth, sweetly curved one to Kaworu's firm, mathematically perfect one. They all loved him and would happily spend all day in bed with him, and had more than once. And he now had official permission to do this for the rest of their lives, every night. All three of them...  
"“哈，实际上，他们三个都曾在赤身裸体、微醺且事后的时候对我说过同样的话。我们的婚礼也几乎是以同样的方式举行的。我的爱情生活既深沉又狂野，部分得归功于酒精。我想我也可以把这归咎于——或者说感谢——美里，”他沉思道。他的目光几乎不由自主地被走在前面的三个背影吸引。她们每一个都美得惊人，从明日香那令人惊艳、线条分明的背，到绫波那光滑、曲线优美的背，再到渚薰那坚实、数学般完美的背。她们都深爱着他，愿意整天和他躺在床上，而且不止一次。现在，他得到了正式的许可，可以每晚都这样做，直到永远。她们三个……”

Shinji Soryu-Ayanami became uncomfortably aware he was suddenly feeling very... compassionate. Oops.  
碇苍龙-绫波突然意识到自己感到非常……同情。哎呀。

He dropped his hands to attempt to cover the abrupt appearance of a tent pole in his trousers. The effort was doomed to failure. He could feel his cheeks heating.  
他放下手试图遮住裤子里突然出现的帐篷。这种努力注定要失败。他感觉到自己的脸颊在发热。

Rei sensed his agitation, and turned to examine his face. She opened her mouth to speak, but stopped before she uttered a single word, seeing his face. He could see her eyes widen, then flicker downward for a moment. A small but definite _smirk_ appeared on her lips. Lips she made sure to slowly lick after she made sure she had eye contact with him. Shinji swallowed, his blush and... compassion getting worse.  
丽感受到了他的焦虑，转过身来审视他的脸。她张开嘴想要说话，却在发出声音前停住了，因为她看到了他的表情。他能看到她的眼睛睁大，然后短暂地向下闪烁。她的唇边浮现出一抹微小却明确的笑意。在确保与他目光接触后，她故意慢慢地舔了舔嘴唇。真嗣咽了咽口水，他的脸红和...同情心愈发严重了。

"You are... tense, my husband. This may be embarrassing," Rei whispered. "I have an idea."  
“你...很紧张，我的丈夫。这可能会让你感到尴尬，”丽低声说，“我有个主意。”

A couple of minutes of walking took the group to the back of the chapel's office side. Rachel, the countergirl, smiled at them as she rapped on the door marked 'Video Department'. A moment later it opened, and she waved them inside.  
几分钟后，一行人走到了教堂办公室的后面。柜台女孩瑞秋朝他们微笑，敲了敲标有‘视频部门’的门。片刻后门开了，她挥手示意他们进去。

Asuka blinked in surprise again. On the large screen over the broad video editing console and monitors, her own face was frozen on a paused video.  
明日香再次惊讶地眨了眨眼。在宽大的视频编辑控制台和监视器上方的大屏幕上，她自己的脸定格在一段暂停的视频中。

"Oh... oh my. Asuka, you look..." Kaworu tried to find words for it. "Asuka, you're _beautiful_."  
“哦……我的天。明日香，你看起来……” 渚薰试图找到合适的词来形容。“明日香，你真美。”

The Asuka on the screen was frozen mid-radiant smile, a look of unfettered joy lighting up her face. She looked impossibly happy, her brilliant blue eyes sparkling at the camera over Shinji's shoulder. The Third Child's back was to the camera, so she was apparently speaking to him at the time the video was paused. Or possibly Rei or Kaworu, who were standing close to Shinji, all three of them facing Asuka.  
屏幕上的明日香定格在灿烂的笑容中，脸上洋溢着无拘无束的喜悦。她看起来无比幸福，她那明亮的蓝眼睛透过真嗣的肩膀闪烁着对着镜头。第三适格者的背影对着镜头，所以她显然是在视频暂停时对他说话。也可能是对绫波或渚薰，他们三人站得离真嗣很近，都面向明日香。

It took Asuka a moment to tear her gaze away, her cheeks slightly pink. "I..." She coughed, her throat suddenly tight. "I take it that's my... ah, speech?"  
过了一会儿，明日香才移开视线，双颊微微泛红。“我……”她清了清突然发紧的喉咙，“我猜那是我……呃，演讲？”

The video tech, a Hispanic man who's nametag said 'Roberto', nodded. He looked shocked himself, suddenly face to face with the woman on his screens. "Uh... y-yes, ma'am. Actually, that's right after it. We were trying to capture the look on your face at that particular moment."  
视频技术人员，一位姓氏牌上写着‘罗伯托’的拉丁裔男子点了点头。他自己也显得很震惊，突然间与屏幕上的女子面对面。“呃……是、是的，女士。实际上，就在那之后。我们试图捕捉您在那个特定时刻的表情。”

"That particular moment?" Hikari asked. "Because she looks so happy?"  
“那个特定时刻？”光问，“因为她看起来很开心吗？”

"That's the moment all three of them said 'Yes', ma'am," he explained. "You... lit up when they did. Even more than during your proposal speech."  
"就在那一刻，他们三人都说了‘是的，女士’，"他解释道。"你……在他们答应时，你的光芒更加耀眼了。甚至比你在求婚演讲时还要明亮。"

Asuka colored further. "A_hem_!" she cleared her throat again. "S-so I see. I... wait, _I_ asked _them?_All three of them? And I made a _speech_?"  
绫波的脸更红了。"咳咳！"她再次清了清嗓子。"那……我明白了。我……等等，是我向他们求婚的？三个人都？我还发表了演讲？"

"Yes, ma'am." The tech hesitated. "You... don't remember? Uh... from the video, the entire thing was your idea."  
"是的，女士。"技术员犹豫了一下。"您……不记得了吗？呃……从视频来看，整个事情都是您的想法。"

"We got a bit drunk afterwards," Asuka mumbled. "And I bet some of the blame goes to Misato on both parts of that. I-...wait, where are Shinji and Rei?"  
"后来我们有点喝多了，" 明日香含糊地说。"我敢打赌，这责任有一部分得归咎于美里。我...等等，真嗣和绫波去哪儿了？"

Kaworu, Hikari, and Touji blinked and looked behind them. There was a distinct lack of Children, First or Third.  
渚薰、光和剑介眨了眨眼，回头看去。那里明显少了第一和第三适格者。

"I... they were right behind us when we left the front, I thought?" Touji said.  
"我...我们离开前门的时候，他们明明就跟在我们后面，我以为？" 剑介说道。

Asuka massaged her forehead. "How do _both_ of them get lost in... agh. Kaworu, where are they?"  
明日香揉着额头。“他们俩怎么会在……啊。渚薰，他们在哪儿？”

Kaworu smiled a bit and swept his eyes across the wall and door. He always did seem to enjoy using his powers at the command of his friends-turned-spouses. "I... there they are. I See them coming down the hall. They'll be here in a moment."  
渚薰微微一笑，目光扫过墙壁和门。他似乎总是乐于在朋友兼配偶的命令下使用自己的能力。“我……他们就在那儿。我看到他们正沿着走廊过来。马上就到了。”

A patter of rapidly approaching feet sounded in the hall, resolving to a missing pair of ex-Pilots slowing down to a walk, their faces red and slightly sweaty. "H-Hi, everyone!" Shinji stammered. "We just got a l-little... sidetracked. Rei and I, um..." He looked at Rei, who was smiling enigmatically.  
走廊里传来一阵急促的脚步声，随后消失不见，取而代之的是一对前驾驶员放慢脚步，面颊微红，略显汗湿。“大、大家好！”真嗣结巴道，“我们只是稍微……走神了。绫波和我，呃……”他看向绫波，她正神秘地微笑着。

The bluenette sauntered over to Kaworu, put her hands on his cheeks, and pulled him into a deep kiss. She broke it off after just a few seconds, however, and turned to do the same thing to Asuka.  
蓝发女孩悠闲地走向渚薰，双手捧住他的脸颊，深深地吻了上去。然而，仅仅几秒钟后，她就结束了这个吻，转身同样对待明日香。

Asuka's eyes went wide as Rei thoroughly kissed her wife. Rei ducked her head to the side to whisper something in Asuka's ear when she ended the kiss, and tucked something into Asuka's right pocket as she did. Asuka's face was beet red when Rei pulled back, and she was biting her lip hard and panting.  
明日香的眼睛因绫波深情地亲吻她的妻子而瞪大。绫波在结束吻后，侧头在她耳边低语了几句，并顺势将某物塞进了明日香的右口袋。当绫波退开时，明日香的脸红得像甜菜根，紧咬着嘴唇，急促地喘息着。

"You can check if you want to," Rei purred quietly. She licked her lips.  
“你可以检查一下，如果你想的话。”绫波轻声细语地低吟，舔了舔嘴唇。

Asuka emitted a high-pitched keening noise, closed her eyes, and vibrated in place for a moment. She gasped and sagged when it ended. She fixed Rei with a glare that managed to mix vengeful admiration and no small amount of frustrated lust. "I... am... _so_ going... to get you... for that... later," Asuka panted.  
明日香发出了一声尖锐的哀鸣，闭上眼睛，原地颤抖了一会儿。当这一切结束时，她喘着气瘫软下来。她用一种混合着报复性的钦佩和不少挫败欲望的眼神瞪着绫波。“我……迟早……会……让你……为此……付出代价……”明日香喘息着说。

"Tonight, I am all yours," Rei said with a tiny smirk.  
“今晚，我完全属于你，”绫波带着一丝微妙的笑意说道。

Asuka bit down on a groan and pinched her eyes shut. "_Stop_ that, you little minx!"  
明日香咬紧牙关，抑制住呻吟，并紧闭双眼。“别这样，你这个小妖精！”

"Not for the rest of our lives," Rei replied. She looked at Kaworu. "Did I put a thought in your head, my other husband?"  
"不是一辈子的事，" 丽回答道。她看向渚。"我是不是在你的脑海里种下了什么念头，我的另一位丈夫？"

The gray-haired Nephilim tore his eyes from where he'd been staring at Shinji. He swallowed. "Nnnng. Nope. I'm good," Kaworu said in a strangled voice. "I'm just going to... stand behind this chair for a bit."  
灰发的拿非利人从盯着真嗣的地方移开了视线。他咽了咽口水。"嗯，没有。我很好，" 渚用一种窒息的声音说道。"我只是要...站在这把椅子后面一会儿。"

Asuka grabbed Shinji's hand and hauled him closer. "Shinji, my dear, could you help hold me up for a bit? My knees are feeling a bit wobbly." She threw another glare at Rei, who continued to look like a cat that had definitely gotten a canary or two.  
明日香抓住真嗣的手，把他拉近了些。"真嗣，亲爱的，你能帮我撑一会儿吗？我的膝盖有点发软。"她又瞪了丽一眼，而丽依旧像是一只绝对已经吃到了一两只金丝雀的猫。

Shinji obligingly put his arms around her, and muttered something into her ear. Asuka's face softened a little. "Dork." She shook herself. "Alright, ah... Roberto? Could you start it... no, wait, back up a bit. Show us the Suzuhara's first, since we came for them first."  
真嗣顺从地抱住她，对着她的耳朵低语了几句。明日香的脸色稍稍缓和了一些。“呆子。”她摇了摇头。“好吧，呃……罗伯特？你能开始了吗……不，等等，先倒回去一点。先给我们看看铃原家的，毕竟我们是为他们来的。”

"Of course, ma'am." The tech sat back down and began pulling up the appropriate video. Rachel closed the door to give them a modicum of privacy to watch, but stayed around herself, apparently wanting to see the whole thing again.  
“当然，女士。”技术人员重新坐下，开始调出相应的视频。瑞秋关上门，给他们留出一点私人空间观看，但她自己却留在一旁，显然是想再看一遍整个过程。

_14 hours before 14 小时前  
_  
"I can't believe we're really doing this!" Hikari almost squealed. "Oh god oh god oh god I've wanted this for _so long!_"  
"真不敢相信我们真的要这么做了！" 光几乎尖叫起来。"哦天啊，哦天啊，哦天啊，我盼这一刻盼了好久！"

"Stay cool, Hikari," Asuka calmed her. "I... _wow_, that stuff Misato gave us is some crazy shit. I feel super-drunk _and_ totally focused and spober. I mean sober." She giggled.  
"冷静点，光，" 明日香安抚她。"我...哇，美里给我们的那玩意儿真是疯狂。我感觉超级醉但又异常清醒和...呃，清醒。" 她咯咯笑了起来。"

"I _know_, right?" Hikari breathed, her shimmery blue satin gown shaking as she tried to suppress her own giggles. "I can't stop thinking about how much I love Touji and want to be his wife _and_ just how hard I'm going to fuck his brains out once we get back to the hotel as a _married couple_!" She waved her tightly clutched bouquet like a wand and did a fairly good impression of Sailor Moon's transformation twirl. "Ta-DAAAA! Magical Fiancée Pretty Hikari is now Super Wifey Suzuhara! In the name of the moon, I will tie you to the bed and ride you all night!"  
"就是啊，对吧？" 光喘着气说，她那闪亮的蓝色缎面礼服随着她试图压抑自己的笑声而颤抖。"我满脑子都是我有多爱阿薰，多想成为他的妻子，还有我们回到酒店后，作为新婚夫妇我要把他折腾得魂飞魄散！" 她挥舞着紧握的花束，像挥动魔杖一样，还模仿了美少女战士变身时的旋转动作。"哒哒！魔法未婚妻美光现在变成了超级妻子铃原！以月亮的名义，我要把你绑在床上，整夜驾驭你！"

"Man, that blue stuff is _gold_ if it can make you talk like this 5 minutes before your _wedding_," Asuka snorted. She paused. "I want some more."  
“天哪，那蓝色玩意儿要是能在你婚礼前五分钟让你这么说话，简直就是金子啊，”明日香嗤笑道。她顿了顿。“我还想要点。”

"I'm just glad it _worked_," Hikari said. "We were already drunk as lords... drunk as ladies? Eh, whatever. Point is, we were already shitfaced when Misato had that great idea. If we showed up here staggering drunk, they'd have turned us away! And I don't want that! I want my _husband_ right now, and I want to get _fucked_!"  
“我只是很高兴它奏效了，”光说。“我们当时已经醉得像老爷们……醉得像女士们？哎，管他呢。重点是，我们当时已经烂醉如泥，是美里想出了那个绝妙的主意。如果我们醉醺醺地踉跄着来这里，他们肯定会把我们赶走！我可不想那样！我现在就要我的丈夫，我要被狠狠地干！”

Asuka covered her mouth with both hands and tried to muffle the sound. Misato had the _BEST_ ideas...  
明日香双手捂住嘴，试图压住声音。美里的主意真是太棒了……

.

.

_Two hours earlier than before...  
比之前早了两个小时...  
_  
"Jesus, Hikari, I know this is your engagement party, but leave _some_ of your fiancé for the wedding?" Misato snarked. The casino bar was scarcely quieter than the gaming floor, but it had fairly good, cheap drinks that went on their rooms' tab, and nice close conversation pits.  
“天哪，光，我知道这是你的订婚派对，但给婚礼留点你未婚夫的时间好吗？”美里嘲讽道。赌场酒吧的喧闹程度几乎不亚于赌场大厅，但这里有相当不错且便宜的饮品，记在房间账上，还有舒适的私密谈话角落。

Hikari slowly and reluctantly pulled her lips away from Touji's, where they'd been welded for a good 10 minutes straight this time. She stayed put right in his lap, though. "I dun ~hic~ wanna, Mishato. I wanna suck face with him and shee if I can get him ta put his hand up my skirt agin."  
光慢慢地、不情愿地从总司的唇上移开，这次他们已经连续吻了整整十分钟。但她仍然坐在他的腿上，没有离开。“我~嗝~不想，美里。我想和他亲热，看看能不能让他再把手伸进我的裙子里。”

"Uh... right here in _public_, Hikari?" Shinji said. He didn't seem to notice he was still sitting so tightly between Asuka and Rei all three of them could check each others' pockets without moving.  
"呃...就在这里，光？" 真嗣说道。他似乎没有注意到自己仍然紧紧地坐在明日香和丽之间，三个人甚至可以不用移动就能互相检查口袋。

"Oh, like _you've_ never done that before," Asuka and Rei said in stereo. They looked at each other in surprise before breaking into laughs and tapping their drinks together.  
"哦，好像你以前没做过似的，" 明日香和丽齐声说道。她们惊讶地对视了一眼，然后爆发出笑声，互相碰杯。

Misato just shook her head. "Man, you need to get fucked in the worst way, Hikari."  
美里只是摇了摇头。"伙计，你真是需要被狠狠地教训一顿，光。"

"Noooo, in the _best_ way, Misato!" Hikari giggled. "By this massive meaty hunk of my man right here! But we _can't_!" she moaned in sadness. Then she moaned in a... less sad manner as she wiggled on Touji's lap.  
"“不，是以最好的方式，美里！”光 giggled。“通过我这位肌肉发达的猛男！但我们不能！”她悲伤地呻吟。随后，她以一种不那么悲伤的方式呻吟着，在真嗣的腿上扭动。”

"Why not?" Misato probed. "You're both old enough, you're _living together_ back home in Japan, and this is your own official _engagement_ party. What's the trouble? You've got your own room, and no one here is going to do anything but cheer you on if you throw Touji over your shoulder, haul him upstairs, and make a man out of him."  
“为什么不呢？”美里追问。“你们都成年了，一起住在日本的家里，这还是你们自己的订婚派对。有什么问题？你们有自己的房间，这里没人会反对，只会为你们加油，如果你把真嗣扛在肩上，带他上楼，让他成为一个真正的男人。”

Touji nuzzled Hikari's neck and gave Misato a sad smile. "She made a promise. And I ain't going to even go near asking her to break it. I love her more than anything, so I'm backing her up one hunnert perschent." He hiccuped.  
真嗣轻吻光的后颈，向美里露出一个悲伤的微笑。“她许下了一个承诺。我不会要求她违背它。我爱她胜过一切，所以我会百分百支持她。”他打了个嗝。

"Promise?" Kaworu asked, idly running his hand through Rei's hair and tracing his fingers down her shoulder. He always was touchy and cuddly when the booze kicked in. Rei shivered in delight and tugged him closer to her other side.  
"承诺？" 渚薰随意地用手梳理着绫波的头发，手指顺着她的肩膀滑下。每当酒精上头，他总是变得爱抚又黏人。绫波高兴得微微颤抖，将他拉近自己的另一侧。

"I promised my mother when she died... I mean, when she waz dying... I mean, when we _thought_ she waz dying, stupid SEELE bullshit..." Hikari said slowly. "Tha I wuddn't have shex with nobody until I was married. So we _wait_. Eben though I've wanted Touji for _years_. 'Cause Imma good girl."  
"我妈妈去世时...我是说，在她临终时...不，是我们以为她要去世时，该死的 SEELE 那套鬼话..." 美里缓缓说道。"她让我发誓，结婚前不会和任何人发生关系。所以我们得等。尽管我多年来一直想要和冬二在一起。因为我是个好女孩。"

"Yeah, but... you love each other and you need this, so maybe y'all should just quit messing around and get married already..."  
"是啊，但是...你们彼此相爱，你们需要这个，所以也许你们应该停止拖延，直接结婚吧..."

"Mmm, that soundz sho gud, Mishato, but... the wedding hall we wanted izn't 'vailable until _December_ and we hav' ta _plan_ errything," Hikari moaned again. "I hate waiting... We've waited for _years_ already..."  
"嗯，那听起来真不错，美里，但是...我们想要的婚礼大厅要到十二月才有空档，我们得安排一切，" 光再次抱怨道。"我讨厌等待...我们已经等了好几年了..."

"Wait!" Misato slammed her fist into her palm, jostling Ryouji as he tried to take a sip of his own Black Russian. "Waitaminute! We're in _Las Vegas_! The one city in the world where 'Hey, I need to get married in a big damn hurry' is _no problem!_"  
"等等！" 美里一拳砸在手掌上，惊得正在尝试喝一口自己的黑俄罗斯的亮司差点洒出来。"等一下！我们在拉斯维加斯！这个世界上唯一一个'嘿，我急需马上结婚'不成问题的地方！"

Asuka barked a laugh. "Ok, hold up there, miss Wedding Planner. Two things I need to mention first. Number one: Shinji is great in bed and he's sleeping with me tonight."  
明日香嗤笑一声。"好吧，先别急，婚礼策划小姐。我得先提两点。第一：真嗣在床上很棒，他今晚要和我一起睡。"

"Asuka, what does that have to do wi-"  
"明日香，这和那有什么关系-"

"Nothing, I just like bragging. Number two: The least drunk one here is Kaworu, and I have watched him down at least six cocktails. And I mean drinks this time."  
"没什么，我就是喜欢吹嘘。第二条：这里最清醒的是渚薰，我亲眼见他至少喝了六杯鸡尾酒。这次我指的是真正的饮料。"

Rei and Shinji started giggling. Kaworu just stuck his tongue out at her and finished off his tumbler. "Seven," he shot back at her. "And you had no complaints when it was your turn last time."  
绫波和真嗣开始咯咯笑起来。渚薰只是对她吐了吐舌头，喝完了他的酒杯。“七杯，”他回敬道，“上次轮到你的时候，你可没抱怨过。”

"Shaddap. Anyhows, Misato, _none_ of ush are anywhere close to sober, or even good enough to fake it. We go near a chapel right now, and they'll tell us to go sleep it off first. This may be Vegas, but Hikari and Jock Stooge are high and dry until we all dry out tomorrow. _Then_ maybe we can talk about moving the wedding from 'this winter' to 'tomorrow night'."  
"闭嘴。总之，美里，我们谁都没清醒到哪儿去，甚至连装都装不好。我们现在靠近教堂，他们肯定会让我们先去醒醒酒。这里是拉斯维加斯，但光和那个傻大个得等到我们明天都清醒了再说。到时候我们再考虑把婚礼从‘今年冬天’提前到‘明晚’吧。"

Misato pouted at her for a moment, then brightened. "HA! Wait! Shows what you know! I've got _this_!" She dug energetically in her large Coach purse for a second before triumphantly pulling out a large screw-topped thermos with a NERV logo on the side. "Ta-Daaaa!"  
美里对她撅了撅嘴，随即眼睛一亮。“哈！等着瞧！让你看看我的本事！”她用力在她的 Coach 大手袋里翻找了一会儿，然后得意地拿出一个带有 NERV 标志的大号螺旋盖保温瓶。“当当当当！”

"What the Hell is that?"  
“那是什么鬼东西？”

"Something Ritz gave me before we left. She just finished it. LCL-derived party fuel!"  
“临走前丽兹给我的。她刚做完。LCL 提取的派对燃料！”

"Uh... explain, Misato?" Shinji asked, taking a sip of his own drink.  
“呃……解释一下，美里？”真嗣喝了一口自己的饮料问道。

"LCL-based, but mixed with some specialized additives and alcohol, it doesn't _exactly_ sober you up, but it makes everything _clear_ if you're sloshed, so you can think and do stuff if you need to _without_ losing your buzz! We can fool them all with this stuff, get Hikari and Touji hitched, and be back here to keep the party going all night! This _is_ our 'Vegas Cut-Loose Week', right?"  
“基于 LCL，但混合了一些特殊添加剂和酒精，虽然不会让你清醒，但如果你喝醉了，它能让你思路清晰，这样你就能在保持醉意的同时思考和做事！我们可以用这个骗过所有人，让光和冬二结婚，然后回到这里继续派对一整晚！这是我们的‘拉斯维加斯放纵周’，对吧？”

"I'm hammered, horny, and hugging more than one person I've slept with, so this all sounds like a _great_ idea!" Asuka shouted. "Hikari, sound good to you?"  
"我喝得烂醉，欲火中烧，还抱着不止一个跟我上过床的人，所以这听起来真是个绝妙的主意！" 明日香大喊道。"光，你觉得怎么样？"

Hikari slammed her own empty cup on the table between her and Misato. "Bartender, fill me the fuck _up_!"  
光将自己空空如也的杯子猛地砸在和美里之间的桌上。"酒保，给我满上！"

_Two hours later... 两小时后...  
_  
"I now pronounce you... man and wife," the minster finished. "You may kiss the bride."  
“我现在宣布你们成为……丈夫和妻子，”牧师说完，“你可以亲吻新娘了。”

Hikari threw her arms around Touji and kissed him harder than ever before. She tossed the bouquet blindly at Asuka, who caught it automatically before her yes-occifer-I-am-sotally-tober brain caught up to what her hands were doing.  
光子紧紧抱住冬二，吻得比以往任何时候都热烈。她盲目地将花束抛向明日香，明日香下意识地接住了，直到她的“警官，我绝对没醉”的大脑才反应过来自己的手在做什么。

Misato giggled and pointed at her from next to Asuka, where she'd been standing in as 'Mother of the Bride' to Asuka's 'Maid of Honor'. Across from them, behind Touji, Ryouji (Father of the Groom) laughed and Shinji (Best Man) looked like he couldn't decide if he wanted to blush or go pale. He settled for staring at Asuka in shock and standing very still.  
美里在一旁咯咯笑着，指着明日香，她作为“新娘的母亲”站在明日香旁边，明日香则是“伴娘”。在他们对面，冬二身后，良治（新郎的父亲）大笑着，而真嗣（伴郎）看起来不知道是该脸红还是变白。他最终选择了震惊地盯着明日香，一动不动地站着。

Asuka couldn't look away. "'You love each other and you need this, so maybe y'all should just quit messing around and get married already...'" she whispered to herself. "'We've waited for years already'..." Shinji wouldn't break the stare either... like he could hear what she was thinking... like always.  
明日香无法移开视线。"'你们相爱并且需要这个，所以也许你们应该停止胡闹，直接结婚算了...'"她自言自语道。"'我们已经等了好几年了'..." 真嗣也没有打破对视...仿佛他能听到她的想法...一如既往。

Hikari was still kissing Touji. With a visible effort of will, she pulled away from Touji just long enough to look at Asuka and Misato. "I... feel _amazing_. Did that just happen? Am I really married?"  
光还在亲吻着斗。她费了很大的劲，才从斗的吻中抽身，足够长的时间去看向明日香和美里。"我...感觉棒极了。刚才真的发生了吗？我真的结婚了吗？"

"Yes, you are, _Mrs. Suzuhara_," Touji said softly in her ear. "'Til death do us part, for better and worse. We're together. I love yoUUU!" He looked quite surprised as his petite little bride hoisted him up over her shoulder and started moving surprisingly quickly towards the doors at the back of the chapel.  
"是的，你是的，铃原太太，"斗在她耳边温柔地说。"'直到死亡将我们分开，无论是好是坏。我们在一起了。我爱你！"他看起来相当惊讶，因为他的娇小新娘将他扛在肩上，开始以惊人的速度向教堂后门移动。

"Asuka we're leaving we'll get a taxi see you tomorrow don't wait up for us don't call we're going to be BUSY!" Hikari said in one rush as she dashed for the exit. "Touji, I love you~~! Mine mine mine! Heeheeheeheeheehee! We're going to get LUCKY!"  
“明日香，我们要走了，会打车回去，明天见，别等我们，别打电话，我们要忙了！” 光子一口气说完，冲向出口。“阿薰，我爱你~~！我的我的我的！嘻嘻嘻嘻嘻嘻！我们要走运了！”

Rei and Kaworu just watched them leave with matching warm smiles. Kaworu sighed after a moment, took out his wallet, and handed Rei 1000 yen. The First Child took it with a small smirk.  
丽和薰只是带着相似的温暖微笑目送他们离开。片刻后，薰叹了口气，拿出钱包，递给丽 1000 日元。第一适格者带着一丝微笑接过。

"Lucky, huh? Hah! I can't believe we pulled this off! In less than 90 minutes, too!" She shook her head. "Ok, well, speaking of feeling lucky, you and I are buzzed, amped on Ritz's Romulan Ale stuff, and full of cash in Sin City. Got any ideas on what we should do next, Mister Inspector?" She elbowed Ryouji.  
“走运了，是吧？哈！真不敢相信我们做到了！还不到 90 分钟！”她摇摇头。“好吧，说到走运，你我都有点醉了，被丽兹的罗慕兰麦芽酒搞得兴奋不已，又在罪恶之城腰缠万贯。有什么好主意接下来该做什么，侦探先生？”她用胳膊肘碰了碰良治。

He laughed. "What, you don't think I can hear what you're thinking, Katsuragi? I'm feeling lucky too."  
他笑道：“怎么，你不觉得我能听到你在想什么吗，葛城？我也感觉自己今天运气不错。”

Misato snorted. "You already got me to marry you, _Mister Katsuragi_. So that's out, lovely as the thought is. Yes, I can hear _you_ thinking too. And I think that's a _great_ idea!"  
美里哼了一声。“你已经让我嫁给你了，葛城先生。所以这个念头就别想了，虽然很诱人。没错，我也能听到你在想什么。我觉得这是个好主意！”

"You, me, high-stakes poker, and our usual bets?" he smiled at her, a sharp edge to it.  
“你我二人，高赌注的扑克，还有我们常下的赌注？”他向她微笑，带着一丝锐利。

"Damn right. First one to lose a pot loses their underwear. Feelin' lucky, mister?" Misato pulled him close and smirked at him.  
"当然没错。第一个输掉一局的就得脱掉内裤。感觉幸运吗，先生？" 美里把他拉近，对他挑衅地笑了笑。

"Never better, Misato. Let's do it. All night."  
"从未如此好过，美里。来吧，整晚都玩。"

Misato mock-swooned. "Oh my, so lusty!" She straightened back up. "Let's hit the high-end tables at the Luxor. I'm feeling Egyptian right now." She looked over at the remaining ex-Pilots. "You all feel like coming to watch my husband fleece some suckers with his incredible poker face?"  
美里装作晕倒的样子。"哦天哪，真是个色鬼！"她又挺直了身子。"我们去卢克索的高档赌桌吧。我现在感觉自己像个埃及人。"她看向剩下的前驾驶员们。"你们都想来围观我丈夫用他那无与伦比的扑克脸宰割一些倒霉蛋吗？"

"I think we'll wait here for a few minutes, Misato," Kaworu said equably. "I think Asuka needs to recover from catching that... tradition."  
"我想我们在这里等几分钟吧，美里，" 渚薰平静地说道，"我觉得明日香需要从抓住那个...传统中恢复过来。"

Misato smirked one more time and nodded. "Yeah, we all know what that means, and probably who. Maybe we'll have another round tomorrow night, ne? Hahaha! Keep ahold of that, Asuka. It's still got my cross!" Misato pointed at the familiar pendant she'd let Hikari borrow on short notice for the traditional 'something borrowed' part of the poem. She linked her arm with Ryouji's and they headed to the parking lot themselves.  
美里再次微微一笑，点了点头。"是啊，我们都知道那意味着什么，可能还知道是谁。也许明晚我们还能再来一轮，对吧？哈哈哈！好好保管那个，明日香。它还挂着我的十字架呢！" 美里指着那个她临时借给光用来完成传统诗句中'借来的东西'部分的熟悉吊坠。她挽着良治的胳膊，两人一起向停车场走去。

Asuka didn't notice. She was still engaged in a stare with Shinji. No... they were drifting closer. Was he moving? Her? She finally broke the look, her eyes dropping to the bouquet still in her hands.  
明日香没有注意到。她仍然在与真嗣对视。不...他们越来越近了。是他动了？还是她？她终于打破了凝视，目光落在了手中仍握着的花束上。

"You're thinking about it, aren't you?" Rei said quietly, putting her hand on Asuka's shoulder.  
"你正在想这件事，对吧？" 丽轻声说道，将手放在明日香的肩上。

Asuka snapped her head up to meet Rei's gaze, her face less than a foot to Asuka's right. How had she gotten so close? When? Wait, she'd asked a question...  
明日香猛地抬起头，与丽的目光相遇，她的脸距离明日香的右侧不到一英尺。她是怎么靠得这么近的？什么时候？等等，她问了一个问题...

"Uh... I... no?" "呃... 我... 没有？"

Rei smiled sadly. "Asuka... everyone knows. It's alright. We all love you. You can do this."  
丽悲伤地笑了。“明日香……大家都知道。没关系的。我们都爱你。你能做到的。”

Asuka looked carefully at Rei, then across at Shinji and Kaworu. "No... no I can't. You're right."  
明日香仔细地看着丽，然后又看了看真嗣和薰。“不……不，我做不到。你说得对。”

Rei looked confused. "I... but I said you _can_. Kaworu and I... we can See it. We know it."  
丽看起来很困惑。“我……但我刚才说你能做到。薰和我……我们能看见。我们知道这一点。”

Asuka shook her head. "No... weren't you listening? To what Misato said earlier? 'You love each other and you need this, so maybe y'all should just quit messing around and get married already...'"  
明日香摇了摇头。“不...你没在听吗？之前美里说的什么来着？‘你们相爱并且需要彼此，所以或许你们应该停止胡闹，干脆结婚算了...’”

"Asuka, that's what I'm suggesting you and Shinji d-"  
“明日香，我就是在建议你和真嗣——”

"No. I've got a _better_ idea. Listen to what Misato said!"  
“不。我有个更好的主意。听听美里的话吧！”

"You and Shinji need each other, and-"  
"你和真嗣需要彼此，而且-"

"No... _we_ need each other."  
"不... 我们需要彼此。"

Rei's eyes widened. "Wha-"  
绫波的眼眸微微睁大。 "什-"

Asuka whirled, a ear-to-ear smile exploding onto her face. "Yes! YES! That's IT! AHAHAHAAH! We can _do that_! It's in the rules!" Asuka waved the glossy pamphlet of _'So You Want To Get Married'_ they'd picked up at the front desk. "Look! Here!" She flipped it open and pointed to something on the second page. "Quartets!" she shouted. "It's legal here! 100% _legal!_"  
明日香猛地转身，满脸绽放出灿烂的笑容。“是的！没错！就是这样！啊哈哈哈哈！我们可以这么做！这在规则里是允许的！”明日香挥舞着他们在前台拿到的光鲜亮丽的‘你想结婚吗’小册子。“看！这里！”她翻开册子，指向第二页的某处。“四重奏！”她喊道。“在这里是合法的！百分之百合法！”

The other three Children exchanged a look. "Asuka, what-" Shinji began.  
其他三位适格者交换了一个眼神。“明日香，什么——”真嗣开口道。

"_I love you all!_" Asuka shouted again, joyously. "All of you! Shinji! _Everyone_ we know knows how much we love each other! We always have! We may be stupid and afraid and constantly hurting each other by accident but we _always_ come back to each other because we know beyond words that we hold each others' heart. I say your name at night when you're not there! I miss you even when I'm mad at you! I can't imagine life without you near me! You were the first, the one who taught me I _am_ worthy of love. And I will never let that feeling go. So... stand there!" She pointed at a spot near the camera, still filming.  
“我爱你们所有人！”明日香再次欢呼，充满喜悦。“你们所有人！真嗣！所有人都知道我们彼此相爱有多深！我们一直都知道！我们可能愚蠢、害怕，还总是无意中伤害对方，但我们总是回到彼此身边，因为我们知道，言语无法表达我们对彼此的心意。你不在的时候，我会在夜里呼唤你的名字！即使我生你的气，我也会想念你！我无法想象没有你在身边的生活！你是第一个，教会我值得被爱的人。我永远不会放弃这种感觉。所以……站在那里！”她指向摄像机仍在拍摄的位置。

Asuka threw her bouquet at Rei. "Rei! We may have started off at each others' throats, but it's amazing what saving each others lives a few times and saving the world can do to change that! And you've always been there for me when I thought Shinji broke my heart, or I did something stupid and thought I made him hate me... You've let me cry on your shoulder a dozen times, a hundred times, kissed away my tears when I thought there was nothing left, pushed me and Shinji back together when even I thought he would be better off with you... You believed in us and loved us when no one else would. I love you, Blue, and I'm not letting you go ever. So you stand... there!" She pushed Rei to stand next to Shinji.  
明日香将她的花束扔向丽。“丽！我们可能一开始互相看不顺眼，但拯救彼此生命几次和拯救世界能改变很多事情，这真是太神奇了！每当我以为真嗣伤了我的心，或者我做了什么蠢事以为他恨我时，你总是在那里支持我...你让我在你的肩膀上哭泣了十几次，上百次，当我以为一切都完了时，你吻干了我的泪水，当我甚至认为他和你在一起会更好时，你推动我和真嗣重新在一起...当没有人相信我们时，你相信我们并爱着我们。我爱你，蓝，我永远不会让你离开。所以你站在...那里！”她推着丽站在真嗣旁边。

Kaworu looked at her sadly, shaking his head. "Asuka, you shouldn't include me. I think this is just that 'Romulan Ale' stuff talking-"  
薰悲伤地看着她，摇了摇头。“明日香，你不应该把我包括在内。我想这只是‘罗慕兰酒’在作祟——”

"You SHUT THE HELL UP, Sparkles!" Asuka pointed her finger firmly at him. "This is _NOT_ 'the Romulan Ale stuff' talking! This is my heart _freed_ from all the fear and bullshit and lies and masks and _AAAARRRGGG_ I always hide it behind! So what if it took that to get here? This is truth and love and years of me being an idiot when everything I have ever wanted or needed right in front of me!"  
"你给我闭嘴，闪闪发光的家伙！" 明日香坚定地用手指着他。"这可不是什么'罗慕兰酒'在作祟！这是我内心摆脱了所有恐惧、胡扯、谎言、面具和那些我总是隐藏在背后的东西后的真实！就算需要这些才能走到这一步又怎样？这是真相、是爱、是我多年来一直是个傻瓜，而所有我想要和需要的就在我面前的事实！"

She pointed at Shinji. "The perfect man, the love of my life, my partner in battle and in life! The one who loved me first, deepest, and makes me cry in the night because I can't believe he really means it when he says those three little words!"  
她指向真嗣。"完美的男人，我生命中的爱人，战斗和生活中的伙伴！第一个爱我、爱得最深的人，让我在夜晚哭泣，因为我无法相信他真的在说那三个小字时是真心的！"

She pointed at Rei. "The perfect _woman_, the one who always believes in me and holds me when I'm weak! Who saved my life over and over when we fought to save the world! Yes, I admit it! I _proclaim_ it! I, Asuka Langley Soryu, love a woman! One, perfect, amazing woman! One goddess, who loves me back..."  
她指向绫波。"完美的女人，总是在我脆弱时支持我、拥抱我的人！在我们为拯救世界而战斗时，一次次救了我的命！是的，我承认！我宣布！我，惣流·明日香·兰格雷，爱一个女人！一个完美、令人惊叹的女人！一个爱我回头的女神……"

She pointed at Kaworu. "And you... I've already got the perfect man, the perfect woman... so what else could a worthless ex-Pilot possibly deserve? You. You, Kaworu fucking Nagisa, the gift of Heaven. The Angel who fell to Earth and gave us hope when there was no light. You're my light-bringer, my fallen Angel, my heavenly messenger who holds the world in his hands and gives it all to us because he thinks he's nothing."  
她指向渚薰。“而你……我已经有完美的男人，完美的女人了……一个无用的前驾驶员还能配得上什么？你。你，渚薰，该死的渚薰，天赐的礼物。那个从天而降的天使，在我们无光之时给予我们希望。你是我的光明使者，我的堕天使，我的天国使者，他手握世界，将一切给予我们，只因他认为自己一文不值。”

Tears started to trickle down Kaworu's face. "Asuka, don't. I... I don't... you don't lov-"  
泪水开始从渚薰的脸颊滑落。“明日香，别这样。我……我不……你不爱——”

"Bull_shit,_ 'I don't love you'! Fuck yes, I do! Kaworu, I can see how you and Shinji are. I _revel_ in it. And I know you love Rei not one iota less. You think I will take them for myself and leave you out in the cold for our whole lives? Idiot. You're all idiots. _I_ decide who I love, and I have let no other man but you and Shinji ever touch my heart, you stupid, beautiful, impossible man. I will have no others but you. You love the ones I love, and they love you. I will neither forsake you or them. We are _all_ for each other. So you... stand... _there_!" Asuka shouted happily, pointing him to a spot on the other side of Shinji from Rei.  
“放屁，‘我不爱你’！当然爱，我当然爱你！渚薰，我看得出你和真嗣的关系。我乐在其中。我也知道你对绫波的爱丝毫不减。你以为我会把他们据为己有，让你一辈子孤零零的？傻瓜。你们都是傻瓜。决定我爱谁的人是我，除了你和真嗣，没有其他男人能触动我的心，你这个愚蠢、美丽、难以捉摸的男人。我只要你。你爱我所爱，他们也爱你。我不会抛弃你或他们。我们都是为了彼此。所以你……站在那里！”明日香开心地喊着，指着真嗣另一边绫波旁边的位置。

Asuka stood facing all three of them. "You can say what you like. 'This is just the night talking, you'll regret this in the morning.' Wrong. This is me speaking freely for the first time. Yes, the night has helped, the feeling of watching Hikari achieve her heart's dream... but all that has done is give me clarity and courage. I've felt like this for a long time. But you know me. Always afraid, always insecure, hiding my heart and soul behind a tsundere mask because I'm too cowardly to admit I need you all and can no longer imagine living without all of you holding me, loving me, being _with_ me..." She wiped at her own tears. "So put all that aside and do what I'm doing: listening to my heart for once in my stupid life. So I'm going to, I'm going to say this all and ask a question before the spell wears off and I retreat from it _again_, running away from seizing the most perfect joy in my universe... No, not this time. This time I listen to what I've wanted for years."  
明日香站在他们三人面前。“你们爱怎么说就怎么说。‘这只是夜晚的情绪作祟，你明早会后悔的。’错了。这是我第一次自由地表达自己。是的，夜晚确实帮了忙，看着光实现她心中的梦想的感觉...但这一切只是让我更加清晰和勇敢。我很久以来就有这种感觉了。但你们了解我。总是害怕，总是不安，把我的心和灵魂藏在傲娇的面具后，因为我太懦弱，不敢承认我需要你们所有人，无法再想象没有你们所有人支撑我、爱我、陪伴我的生活...”她擦去自己的泪水。“所以把那些都抛开，做我现在做的事：在我愚蠢的生命中第一次倾听我的心声。所以我要，我要说出这一切，并在魔法消失、我再次退缩之前问一个问题，不再逃避抓住我宇宙中最完美的喜悦...不，这次不会了。这次我要倾听我多年来的渴望。”

She took a deep breath. "Shinji, Rei, Kaworu... I don't deserve you. I'm arrogant, harsh, selfish, stupid, and cowardly. I've been a fool for years, pretending I didn't want this. But I love you more than I will ever be able to say, even if I started now and did it for the rest of my life. And I plan to. I need you more than I'll ever be able to admit ever again, though I will try. I need you to stay with me, to make me strong and powerful and whole. I need you because I'm nothing without you. And I want you all, the three most beautiful, sexy, loving people I've ever known or ever will. You are my heart, my soul, and my world. I don't care if tomorrow we all wake up and this vanishes like some dream of mist and fog. I want this moment, now and forever. So I ask you, all of you, I beg you... will you all marry me, love me, stay with me, and be my husband, husband, and wife for the rest of our lives?"  
她深吸了一口气。“真嗣，丽，薰...我不配拥有你们。我傲慢、苛刻、自私、愚蠢又懦弱。多年来我一直是个傻瓜，假装我不想要这一切。但我对你们的爱超越了我所能表达的极限，即便我从现在开始，用尽余生去诉说。我打算这么做。我对你们的需要超越了我能再次承认的极限，尽管我会努力。我需要你们留在我身边，让我变得坚强、有力、完整。我需要你们，因为没有你们我什么都不是。我想要你们三个，我所认识或将会认识的最美丽、性感、充满爱的人。你们是我的心脏，我的灵魂，我的世界。我不在乎明天我们醒来时这一切是否像雾和梦一样消散。我想要这一刻，现在直到永远。所以我问你们，你们所有人，我恳求你们...你们愿意嫁给我，爱我，留在我身边，成为我的丈夫、丈夫和妻子，共度余生吗？”

There was five heartbeats of the loudest silence that chapel had ever seen.  
教堂里出现了五次心跳般的最响亮的沉默。

Three voices spoke in harmony.  
三个声音和谐地响起。

"Yes." "是的。"

And all was right with the world.  
而世界一切安好。
