Asuka dreams of Kaji. His face swims in front of her, scruffy, angular, adult, tantalizingly close. She smiles, and he smiles too, that lazy, roguish smirk that somehow feels like it's just for her, and she shuts her eyes and leans forward and presses her lips against his. And he reciprocates! His mouth is warm motion on hers, his arms come up around her and hold her close to him, and when she opens her eyes, her face freezes because it's not Kaji holding her but _Shinji,_ Stupid Shinji, his eyes as gentle and warm as a worn-in blanket. He smiles softly, just for her. Because of her. He kisses her again and one hand tangles in her hair and it's utterly unbearable, how close he is, how hot his skin is, how much he seems to _want_ her –  
明日香梦见了梶。他的脸在她面前游动，邋遢，棱角分明，成人，诱人地靠近。她笑了，他也笑了，那种懒散、无赖的笑容，不知怎么的，感觉就像是只为她准备的，她闭上眼睛，身体前倾，把嘴唇贴在他的嘴唇上。他回报！他的嘴在她的嘴上温热地移动，他的手臂搂住她，将她紧紧地抱在自己身边，当她睁开眼睛时，她的脸僵住了，因为抱她的不是真嗣，而是真嗣，愚蠢的真嗣，他的眼睛像破旧的毯子一样温柔而温暖。他温柔地笑着，只为她。因为她。他再次吻她，一只手缠在她的头发上，这完全无法忍受，他有多近，他的皮肤有多热，他似乎多么想要她——

Her eyes snap open. It's still too hot. She feels rivulets of sweat creeping down her face. Her whole body is damp. She rolls over, stickily, and discovers she's kicked the blankets off in her sleep. The faint sound of the television reaches her ears, a muted slush of indistinct Japanese.  
她的眼睛猛地睁开。还是太热了。她感觉到汗水顺着她的脸滑落。她的整个身体都是湿的。她粘稠地翻了个身，发现自己在睡梦中把毯子踢掉了。电视微弱的声音传到她的耳朵里，是一团模糊不清的日语的柔和泥泞。

"Disgusting," she whispers, and gets out of bed.  
“恶心，”她低声说，然后下了床。

She shucks off her t-shirt, her shorts, her panties. The air is unpleasantly humid. She decides to take a shower. Douse herself in cold water. Rid her skin of the disgusting residue curdling on it, amplified by the heat. She grimaces and snatches a discarded towel from the floor, wrapping it around herself. _If he tries anything…he won't try anything._ She forcefully tamps down on the sudden, stinging humiliation prickling at the corners of her eyes and leaves her room.  
她脱掉了她的T恤、短裤和内裤。空气潮湿得令人不快。她决定洗个澡。把自己泡在冷水中。清除她的皮肤上凝结的令人作呕的残留物，这些残留物被热量放大了。她做了个鬼脸，从地板上抓起一条废弃的毛巾，把它裹在自己身上。如果他尝试任何事情......他不会尝试任何事情。她用力地压制住了眼角突然刺痛的羞辱，然后离开了她的房间。

She pauses as she's passing through the living room, greeted by a strange sight: Shinji Ikari, naked save for a pair of shorts, lying spread-eagled on the _tatami,_ eyes closed. She'd think he was dead if she couldn't see the rise and fall of his skinny chest. She frowns. His nipples are brown. His body glistens with a thin sheen of sweat. His cheeks are a little flushed. His lips are parted just a bit.  
当她穿过客厅时，她停了下来，映入眼帘的是奇怪的景象：碇真嗣，除了一条短裤外，赤身裸体，睁开眼睛躺在榻榻米上，闭着眼睛。如果她看不到他瘦弱的胸膛的起伏，她会以为他已经死了。她皱起眉头。他的是棕色的。他的身体闪耀着一层薄薄的汗水。他的脸颊有些发红。他的嘴唇稍微分开了一下。

The thought of leaning down and waking him up flashes through her head, unbidden. She thinks of her dream. Her lip curls. The reality of his kiss was nothing like that at all. The reality of him is –  
俯下身子叫醒他的念头在她的脑海中闪过，毫不犹豫。她想起了自己的梦想。她的嘴唇弯起。他接吻的现实根本不是那样的。他的现实是——

She doesn't let herself finish the thought. She whirls on her heel. The washroom door crunches shut. The TV murmurs on. Shinji breathes.  
她不让自己完成这个想法。她踩着高跟鞋旋转着。洗手间的门嘎吱嘎吱地关上了。电视上传来嘀咕声。真嗣深吸一口气。

He hasn't moved when she exits, refreshed but no less disgruntled. Her feet come to a stop just behind his head. She frowns. She hears cicadas, birds, distant traffic. Blazing rectangles of light strain hungrily towards the boy's prone form, stopping just short of his feet. She traces the edge of one of them to its source: the patio door, thrown wide open. She squints. The city outside wobbles gently.  
当她离开时，他没有动弹，神清气爽，但同样不满。她的脚在他的头后面停了下来。她皱起眉头。她听到蝉鸣、鸟鸣和远处的车流。炽热的长方形光芒如饥似渴地向男孩俯卧的身躯挤去，在离他不远的地方停了下来。她追踪了其中一个的边缘，找到了它的源头：天井的门，敞开着。她眯着眼睛。外面的城市轻轻地摇晃着。

…_breaking? Yes, it's incredible! Japan hasn't seen temperatures this hot in twenty years! The high today is expected to be 44 degrees…_  
…打破？是的，这太不可思议了！日本已经有二十年没有出现过这么热的气温了！今天的最高气温预计为44度...

"Dummkopf!" Asuka snarls, slamming the patio door so hard the glass shudders in the frame. "Are you stupid? Why do you have the doors OPEN during a HEAT WAVE?!"  
“傻瓜！”明日香咆哮着，狠狠地砸在露台的门上，玻璃在框架中颤抖。“你傻吗？为什么在热浪中你把门开着？！

"Uh?" Shinji blinks up at her muzzily, uncomprehending.  
“嗯？”真嗣含糊不清地朝她眨了眨眼。

She groans wordlessly in fury and stomps over. Shinji, sensing danger, tries to get out of the way, but he's not quick enough; her foot makes forceful contact with his back. He cries out and goes limp, slumping bonelessly on his face. She scoffs.  
她愤怒地无言地呻吟着，跺了跺脚。真嗣感觉到危险，试图躲开，但他的速度不够快;她的脚用力地接触他的背部。他大声喊叫，一瘸一拐地瘫倒在脸上。她嗤之以鼻。

He turns his head so he can frown confusedly at her knees, cheek smooshed into the mat. "What was that for?!" There's a distinct whine in his voice, dulled by the heat.  
他转过头来，困惑地皱着眉头看着她的膝盖，脸颊贴在垫子上。 “这是干什么用的？！”他的声音里有一种明显的呜咽，被热得变得迟钝。

"Because it's your fault I woke up in a puddle of my own sweat!"  
“因为是你的错，我醒来时发现自己的汗水坑里！”

"How is that _my_ fault?"  
“这怎么是我的错？”

"Are you deaf? You opened the damn patio door!"  
“你是聋子吗？你打开了该死的露台门！

"Because the air conditioners broke! Both of them!"  
“因为空调坏了！他们俩！

"What?!" “什么？！”

Horrified, Asuka turns and beholds the wall-mounted air conditioning unit in the living room. It taunts her with its complete and perfect silence. She clutches her towel, whirling towards the dining room.  
明日香吓坏了，转过身来，看到了客厅里的壁挂式空调。它以完全和完美的沉默嘲弄她。她抓着毛巾，转身朝餐厅走去。

"I kept telling Misato-san, hey, the one in the dining room isn't blowing cold air anymore, and the one in the living room is making funny noises," calls Shinji from behind her. "And she tells me, _don't you worry Shinji-kun, I'll take care of it'_…" His scoff is quickly swallowed by a yawn.  
“我一直告诉美里先生，嘿，餐厅里的那个不再吹冷空气了，客厅里的那个在发出奇怪的声音，”真嗣在她身后喊道。“她告诉我，真嗣君，你不用担心，我会处理的......”他的嘲笑很快就被一个哈欠吞下了。

"So you're just going to lie here and…and _marinate?!"_ she shrills incredulously, turning to look at him. He's on his side and looks very resigned.  
“所以你就要躺在这里......腌制呢？！“她难以置信地尖叫着，转过身看着他。他站在自己这边，看起来很无奈。

One shoulder lifts in a shrug. His collarbone is very sharp. "Can't really do anything else."  
耸耸肩抬起肩膀。他的锁骨非常锋利。“真的无能为力。”

"Mein Gott, you're hopeless. I'm going to change."  
“Mein Gott，你没可救药了。我要改变。

She emerges from her room clad in a bikini top and the shortest pair of shorts she owns, her hair pulled into a ponytail to expose her slender neck. Shinji is laying where she found him. His eyes land on her for a brief moment and dart away again. His expression doesn't change. The redness in his cheeks is the one that's been there since she saw him. She grits her teeth. The patio door is open again.  
她穿着比基尼上衣和她拥有的最短的短裤从房间里出来，她的头发扎成马尾辫，露出她纤细的脖子。真嗣躺在她找到他的地方。他的目光在她身上停留了一会儿，然后又飞快地飞走了。他的表情没有改变。他脸颊上的红红是自从她看到他以来一直存在的。她咬紧牙关。天井的门又打开了。

(that's all he ever does, _look,_ his eyes darting away as soon as she catches him – furtive, hiding)  
（这就是他所做的一切，看，他的眼睛一抓住他就飞快地移开——偷偷摸摸，躲起来）

She turns her head. "Isn't there a fan, or…or _anything?"_ She can't keep the frustration out of her voice.  
她转过头。“是不是没有风扇，或者......或者别的什么？她无法抑制自己声音中的沮丧。

"Nope," says Shinji glumly. "Believe me, I looked."  
“不，”真嗣闷闷不乐地说。“相信我，我看过了。”

"Well, obviously you didn't do it hard enough!"  
“嗯，显然你做得还不够努力！”

Asuka gets sweaty all over again as she tears through the apartment with no luck. Rage courses through her as she wrenches open the door to Misato's room and finds it empty.  
明日香再次汗流浃背，她在公寓里撕扯着没有运气。当她拧开美里房间的门时，愤怒在她心中蔓延，发现里面空无一人。

"Diese _Schlampe!"_ she shrieks. "She totally planned this!"  
“Diese Schlampe！”她尖叫道。“她完全计划了这件事！”

"She left really early this morning," sighs Shinji when she stomps back into the living room. "I know because I heard the front door close."  
“她今天一大早就走了，”真嗣叹了口气，跺着脚回到客厅。“我知道，因为我听到前门关上了。”

"Did you spend all night in here?!"  
“你在这儿过夜了吗？！”

"Pretty much. I woke up at two and couldn't get back to sleep, and there's no window in my room, so…"  
“差不多。我两点醒来，再也睡不着了，我的房间里没有窗户，所以......”

"Hmph." She flops down on the floor. Silence falls between them. Asuka mentally curses the lack of central air conditioning, the weather, the stupid boy beside her. There's some blisteringly brainless game show playing on the TV. She stares at it, numb.  
“哼。”她扑通一声倒在地板上。他们之间一片寂静。明日香在心里诅咒没有中央空调，天气，她身边的那个傻男孩。电视上正在播放一些无脑的游戏节目。她盯着它，麻木了。

"Actually, you know what," says Shinji, getting to his feet. "There's one thing we can do…"  
“其实，你知道吗，”真嗣说，站起来。“有一件事我们可以做......”

The sound of quiet footsteps. A cabinet door opening. The creak of cardboard. A metallic rasp.  
安静的脚步声。橱柜门开口。纸板的吱吱声。金属锉刀。

She turns. Shinji is coming towards her with a roll of aluminum foil in one hand and a pair of flip-flops in the other. She smiles before she can stop herself.  
她转过身。真嗣一只手拿着一卷铝箔，另一只手拿着一双人字拖向她。她笑了笑，还没来得及停下来。

"Good thinking, Third! I'm impressed."  
“好主意，第三！我印象深刻。

He smiles back. "I'm just sorry I didn't think of it sooner."  
他回以微笑。“对不起，我没有早点想到。”

Shinji slips on the sandals and steps onto the veranda.  
真嗣穿上凉鞋，走上阳台。

"No, Idiot Shinji," snaps Asuka, clambering to her feet. "You're doing it wrong."  
“不，白痴真嗣，”明日香厉声说，爬了起来。“你做错了。”

Shinji pauses, frowning. "I don't think so. The foil – "  
真嗣停顿了一下，皱着眉头。“我不这么认为。铝箔——”

"Goes on the _inside,_ not the outside."  
“向内走，不向外走。”

His frown deepens. "Actually, I'm pretty sure it's the other way around."  
他的眉头皱得更深了。“实际上，我很确定情况正好相反。”

"And I'm pretty sure it's my way around!" Quick as a snake, she snatches the roll of foil from Shinji's hand.  
“而且我很确定这是我的出路！”她像蛇一样敏捷，从真嗣手中抢走了箔纸卷。

"_Ahss-kahh_," he whines. Her name comes out as a tired hiss, dissolving quickly in the heavy air.  
“啊，”他抱怨道。她的名字发出疲惫的嘶嘶声，迅速消失在沉重的空气中。

"_Sheen-jee,"_ she singsongs back. "Remind me, which one of us has the university degree?"  
“Sheen-jee，”她唱着歌。“提醒我，我们谁有大学学位？”

"Was it in advanced aluminum foil origami?" he grumbles, grabbing at the roll.  
“是高级铝箔折纸吗？”他抱怨着，抓着卷子。

She yanks it out of his reach. "No! That's not even a thing, stupid. It was applied mathematics."  
她把它从他够不到的地方拽出来。“不！那甚至都不是一回事，愚蠢。这是应用数学。

He makes another grab for it. She dances out of the way, further into the apartment. Shinji follows.  
他又抓了一把。她跳舞着离开，进一步进入公寓。真嗣紧随其后。

"Asuka," he says, patiently, desperately, like he's trying to talk down a mischievous toddler – irritation flares – "putting the foil on the inside is going to bake us like potatoes. The reflected heat will – "  
“明日香，”他耐心地、绝望地说，就像他试图说服一个淘气的蹒跚学步的孩子一样——恼怒发作——“把铝箔纸放在里面会把我们烤得像土豆一样。反射的热量将——”

"Don't you dare lecture me on physics, Third! You've got some nerve. You were the one who didn't know anything about thermal expansion."  
“你不敢给我讲物理课吗，第三！你有一些勇气。你是那个对热膨胀一无所知的人。

His face scrunches up. "Whatever, that's not the point. When I was a kid I –"  
他的脸皱了起来。“不管怎样，这不是重点。当我还是个孩子的时候，我——”

"Don't care, didn't ask! Besides, you still _are_ a kid, dummy."  
“别在意，没问！再说了，你还是个孩子，笨蛋。

She leads him all around the living room, smirking at his protestations. He doesn't share her amusement, only getting more and more aggravated until finally he abandons all sense of self-preservation and launches himself at her like an American football player. Asuka is caught off-guard, and his torso slams into hers, sending them both toppling to the floor in a tangle of limbs.  
她领着他在客厅里走来走去，对他的抗议傻笑。他没有分享她的乐趣，只会越来越恼火，直到最后他放弃了所有的自我保护意识，像美式橄榄球运动员一样向她发起攻击。明日香措手不及，他的躯干撞上了她的躯干，使他们俩都瘫倒在地板上，四肢纠缠不清。

Her face contorts. Shinji is everywhere and his sweat is everywhere and he's _heavy_ on her, surprisingly so for such a skinny bag of bones. The smell of him is thick in her nostrils, soap and salt and teenage boy. His bare, slick skin rubs against hers as he wrestles her for the roll.  
她的脸扭曲了。真嗣无处不在，他的汗水无处不在，他对她很重，令人惊讶的是，对于这样一个瘦骨嶙峋的袋子来说。他的气味在她的鼻孔里很浓，肥皂和盐还有十几岁的男孩。他裸露光滑的皮肤摩擦着她的皮肤，同时他让她摔跤。

"Gross! You pervert!" she shrieks, heat erupting in her cheeks. She extends her arm out as far as it'll go, determined to keep the roll out of his reach. She starts thrashing, trying to disentangle herself.  
“恶心！你这个！“她尖叫着，热气在她的脸颊上喷涌而出。她尽可能地伸出胳膊，决心不让他够得着。她开始抽搐，试图解开自己。

"Asuka, just give me the – wait, stop, you're – EEP!"  
“明日香，给我——等等，停下，你是——EEP！”

Her knee makes contact with something soft, and then one of Shinji's flailing limbs smacks her in the face, so she hits back as hard as she can with the roll of foil still clutched in her fist. Shinji yowls and scrabbles blindly off of her, finally managing to free himself.  
她的膝盖接触到了柔软的东西，然后真嗣的一只挥舞的肢体打在了她的脸上，所以她用拳头里仍然握着的箔纸卷尽可能地反击。真嗣大叫着，盲目地从她身上挣扎，终于设法摆脱了自己。

"That _hurt,"_ he says, shooting her a wounded look from where he's curled in a ball, out of her reach. His face is flushed. No doubt hers is too.  
“好疼，”他说，从他蜷缩成一团的地方射向她一个受伤的眼神，她够不到。他的脸涨得通红。毫无疑问，她也是。

"Good," she pants, glaring back, daring him to say something. She gets to her feet, yanks her bikini top back into place, and tightens her now-messy ponytail. Shinji looks away and keeps his mouth shut. She tosses her hair, suddenly tired.  
“很好，”她喘着粗气，瞪着他，不敢说些什么。她站起身来，把比基尼上衣拉回原位，然后拉紧现在凌乱的马尾辫。真嗣移开视线，闭上了嘴巴。她甩了甩头发，突然累了。

"Now," she snaps. "Watch and learn."  
“现在，”她厉声说。“边看边学。”

The living room windows are covered in foil in record time, casting the apartment into dimness. Shinji eyes her impassively.  
客厅的窗户在创纪录的时间内被箔纸覆盖，使公寓陷入昏暗。真嗣冷漠地看着她。

"Please don't scream at me later, saying it's all my fault again," he grumbles. "Because it's not. Putting the foil on the inside was _your_ idea. I want to make sure you to know that."  
“请以后不要对我大喊大叫，说这都是我的错，”他抱怨道。“因为事实并非如此。把铝箔放在里面是你的主意。我想确保你知道这一点。

"Shut up!" She smacks the foil roll into her free hand menacingly. Shinji flinches.  
“闭嘴！”她气势汹汹地将铝箔卷砸在她空出的手上。真嗣退缩了。

She flops back down on the mat and begins flipping through the channels. Shinji doesn't protest any further. Good. It's too hot to tussle anymore. Eventually she settles on a soap opera.  
她扑通一声倒在垫子上，开始翻阅频道。真嗣没有再抗议。好。太热了，不能再争吵了。最终，她选择了一部肥皂剧。

One episode finishes. Then another. Then another. Then another. Asuka isn't feeling any cooler. In fact, if anything, she feels warmer. The air has become oppressive, almost physical, hot and humid and smothering. It's hard to breathe. She thinks of Angels, of waiting, skin itching; it's that feeling, externalized, everywhere, cooking her alive. She looks at Shinji. He's propped up on a pillow, watching the TV upside down on his back. His eyes have a glazed quality to them. Sweat drips gently into his hair. His shorts are hiked up past mid-thigh. Thanks to the angle of his hips, canted by another cushion, she can see the slight bulge of his junk through the fabric. Her mouth turns downward. Boys are so crude. She thinks about smacking him, but her limbs feel too heavy. Truthfully, and she _hates_ this truth, it's not anything she hasn't seen before. Between the plugsuits, and those vulgar exercise outfits Misato made them wear for a week straight…at least the plugsuits have a crotch-guard. She grimaces.  
一集结束了。然后是另一个。然后是另一个。然后是另一个。明日香并没有感到凉爽。事实上，如果有的话，她会感到更温暖。空气变得压抑，几乎是物理的，炎热，潮湿和令人窒息。呼吸困难。她想着天使，想着等待，想着皮肤瘙痒;就是那种感觉，外在的，无处不在的，把她活生生地煮熟。她看着真嗣。他靠在枕头上，仰面倒挂着看着电视。他的眼睛有一种呆滞的品质。汗水轻轻地滴落在他的头发上。他的短裤已经过了大腿中部。多亏了他臀部的角度，由另一个垫子倾斜，她可以通过织物看到他的垃圾轻微凸起。她的嘴巴往下翘。男孩子太粗鲁了。她想打他一巴掌，但她的四肢感觉太重了。说实话，她讨厌这个真相，这不是她以前没见过的东西。在连体裤和那些粗俗的运动装之间，美里让他们连续穿了一个星期......至少 Plugsuit 有一个护胯。她做了个鬼脸。

She and Shinji share a special purpose, a classroom, an apartment, _bathwater –_ damn the Japanese and their backward customs! their too-thin walls of literal _paper!_ She hears him rustling in his room at night, is sometimes woken by a quickly stifled cry because he'd had a nightmare. Does he hear her too? He does her laundry. He makes her lunches. They're on top of each other, mashed together, Asuka coated in Shinji and Shinji coated in Asuka, and no amount of baths in this thrice-damned pressure cooker of an apartment will wash that out. She hates it, hates how _comfortable_ she's become, resigned utterly to this unfamiliar closeness. And yet – and _yet –_ somehow, insultingly, Shinji Ikari remains as distant as the moon, totally remote despite hanging over her every move. Dull. Boring. Inscrutable. His mouth, unmoving on hers. His arms, resolutely at his sides. She was _kissing_ him, for God's sake!  
她和真嗣有一个共同的用途，一间教室、一间公寓、洗澡水——该死的日本人和他们落后的习俗！他们太薄的文字纸墙！她晚上听到他在房间里沙沙作响，有时被迅速压抑的哭声吵醒，因为他做了一个噩梦。他也听到了吗？他帮她洗衣服。他为她做午餐。它们彼此叠在一起，捣碎在一起，明日香涂有真嗣，真嗣涂有明日香，在这个该死的公寓三倍的压力锅里，再多的浴缸也无法洗掉它。她讨厌它，讨厌她变得多么舒适，完全屈服于这种陌生的亲密关系。然而——然而——不知何故，侮辱性地，碇真嗣仍然像月亮一样遥远，尽管笼罩着她的一举一动，但她却完全遥远。钝痛。无聊的。高深莫测。他的嘴，一动不动地贴在她的嘴上。他的双臂，坚定地放在身体两侧。看在上帝的份上，她在吻他！

When she finds his face again, she sees that he's watching her with half-lidded eyes, mouth impassive. She turns quickly away from him, embarrassed at being caught staring.  
当她再次找到他的脸时，她看到他正用半睁着的眼睛看着她，嘴巴无动于衷。她迅速转身离开他，因为被人盯着看而感到尴尬。

"Hey, Asuka…doesn't it feel much hotter in here to you?"  
“嘿，明日香......你觉得这里是不是更热？

"Nope!" she says. "Not a bit!"  
“不！”她说。“一点也不！”

"Hmm…that's odd…" “嗯......这很奇怪......”

She grits her teeth. What's with that attitude? She turns back to him, intending to attempt to verbally hammer him into submission, but his head is turned away from her, looking towards the dining room.  
她咬紧牙关。这种态度是怎么回事？她转过身来，试图用言语敲打他，让他屈服，但他的头却从她身上转开，看向餐厅。

Pen-Pen stands in the doorway. He looks at Asuka and Shinji. Asuka and Shinji look at him. Then he turns around and waddles away towards the kitchen. The fridge opens. Pen-Pen reappears, holding a beer. There's something almost like sympathy in his eyes. Then he disappears. There's the sound of another fridge door opening. Then silence.  
Pen-Pen站在门口。他看着明日香和真嗣。明日香和真嗣看着他。然后他转过身，蹒跚地走向厨房。冰箱打开。Pen-Pen再次出现，手里拿着啤酒。他的眼中流露出一种近乎同情的神色。然后他消失了。又传来冰箱门打开的声音。然后沉默。

Asuka and Shinji look at each other.  
明日香和真嗣面面相觑。

The race to the refrigerator is short and brutal. Shinji has a head start since he's closer, but Asuka grabs him by the hair and launches herself ahead. It ends with Asuka splayed in the prime spot against the shelves and Shinji at her feet. He starts grabbing beer cans and moans when he puts one on his stomach.  
通往冰箱的竞赛是短暂而残酷的。真嗣因为距离更近，所以占了先机，但明日香抓住了他的头发，让自己领先。它以明日香在架子的黄金位置张开，真嗣在她的脚下结束。他开始抓啤酒罐，当他把一个放在肚子上时，他会呻吟。

"Stop making that sound, it's disgusting."  
“别再发出那种声音了，太恶心了。”

"Mmnnnh…they're like ice packs, Asuka, seriously…"  
“嗯......它们就像冰袋一样，明日香，说真的......”

She grabs one and presses it against her face.  
她抓起一个，按在脸上。

"It's…nice," she manages, just barely holding in a moan of her own. She watches as Shinji covers himself as best he can in Misato's alcohol stash. Ooh, she won't be happy about that one. Asuka smirks.  
“这......很好，“她设法，只是勉强忍住自己的呻吟。她看着真嗣在美里的酒藏室里尽其所能地掩盖自己。哦，她不会为此感到高兴的。明日香傻笑。

They're woken an undeterminable amount of time later by Misato's shriek. Asuka only has time to open her eyes before she finds herself being thrown bodily from the fridge. There's a heavy cacophony of falling cans and then Shinji shouts as he, too, is presumably violently dislodged.  
过了一段时间，他们被美里的尖叫声吵醒了。明日香只来得及睁开眼睛，就发现自己被从冰箱里扔了出来。一阵沉重的罐头掉落的声音响起，然后真嗣大喊大叫，因为他大概也被猛烈地脱落了。

"As if my electricity bill isn't already high enough! I ought to make you kids pay rent! You've probably broken the fridge!" Suddenly, Misato's eyes widen in horror. Her face goes pale.  
“好像我的电费还不够高！我应该让你们这些孩子付房租！你可能把冰箱弄坏了！突然，美里惊恐地瞪大了眼睛。她的脸色变得苍白。

"My beer," she whimpers. "My _beer."_ She grabs a can. She closes her eyes.  
“我的啤酒，”她呜咽着说。“我的啤酒。”她抓起一个罐头。她闭上了眼睛。

"You know. I've had a very, very _tiring_ day. And _there is no more cold beer and it's all your fault."_  
“你知道的。我度过了非常非常累的一天。而且没有更多的冰镇啤酒，这都是你的错。

Asuka wipes drool off her cheek and watches, awe-struck, as Misato's face turns from ashen to traffic-light red in a matter of seconds. The color clashes magnificently with her hair. A vein throbs in her temple. She's never seen the older woman this angry before in her life. When she barrels toward Asuka she wonders, for a fraction of a second, if this is how she dies. But instead Misato grabs her by the arm and hauls her to her feet. She drags her across the kitchen where Shinji is pressed up against the cabinets, eyes wide, and grabs his arm too. Then she drags them both into the entryway and shoves them out the door.  
明日香擦去脸颊上的口水，惊讶地看着美里的脸在几秒钟内从灰白变成了红绿灯的红色。颜色与她的头发相得益彰。一根血管在她的太阳穴中跳动。她这辈子从来没见过这么生气的老妇人。当她冲向明日香时，她想，有那么一秒钟，她是不是就是这样死的。但相反，美里抓住了她的胳膊，把她拖了起来。她拖着她穿过厨房，真嗣被压在橱柜上，睁大眼睛，还抓住了他的胳膊。然后她把他们俩拖进入口，把他们推到门外。

The air is oven-like against her refrigerator-chilled skin. Asuka snaps out of her shocked stupor and starts hammering on the door.  
空气像烤箱一样贴在她被冰箱冻住的皮肤上。明日香从震惊的昏迷中醒来，开始敲打门。

"Hey! Let me in! I'm not decent!" She turns to Shinji and glares. "Why are you just standing there?! Back me up here!"  
“嘿！让我进去！我不体面！她转向真嗣，瞪了他一眼。“你为什么就站在那里？！把我扶到这儿来！

He shoots her an anxious look but joins her, adding his voice to her own.  
他向她投去一个焦急的眼神，但加入了她，将他的声音加入了她自己的声音。

"M-Misato-san! Please let us back in! We're sorry!"  
“美里先生！请让我们回来！对不起！

"No we are _not,"_ snaps Asuka. "This is _all her fault!_ If she'd have just fixed the damn air conditioners when you told her to –"  
“不，我们不是，”明日香厉声说。“这都是她的错！如果她只是在你告诉她的时候修好了该死的空调——”

The door opens. Asuka is cut off mid-sentence by a t-shirt to the face. By the time she recovers, the door is shut again.  
门开了。明日香在话说到一半时被一件T恤打断了脸。当她恢复过来时，门又关上了。

"Bitch!" she shrieks before yanking the shirt over her head.  
“婊子！”她尖叫着，然后把衬衫拉到头上。

Misato was kind enough to also give them shoes and their wallets. She bends down and snatches hers off the ground and jams her feet viciously into a pair of flip-flops.  
美里很好心，还给了他们鞋子和钱包。她弯下腰，把她的脚从地上抓起来，恶狠狠地把脚塞进一双人字拖里。

"So," says Shinji. "Now what?"  
“所以，”真嗣说。“现在怎么办？”

"Now you shut the hell up, that's what," Asuka snaps, sticking her face into his. He backs off, looking startled.  
“现在你他妈的闭嘴，就是这样，”明日香厉声说，把脸贴在他的脸上。他后退了一步，看起来吓了一跳。

"Well…it's Misato's problem now," he says. "Her turn to become a baked potato."  
“嗯......现在是美里的问题，“他说。“轮到她变成烤土豆了。”

"Hmph. Yeah, whatever. She deserves it. Come on, Shinji, let's go somewhere with a functional AC."  
“哼，嗯，随便。这是她应得的。来吧，真嗣，我们去一个有功能性空调的地方吧。

The two pilots traipse through the parking lot, Asuka in the lead. She can feel the heat of the asphalt through her shoes. The sun beats mercilessly down from above. She imagines she can feel the skin of her legs crisping gently like bacon in a pan. She walks a little faster.  
两名飞行员在停车场穿梭，明日香在前面。她可以透过鞋子感觉到沥青的热量。太阳无情地从天而降。她想象着她能感觉到她腿上的皮肤像锅里的培根一样轻轻地酥脆。她走得快了一点。

The train station appears ahead of them like an oasis in the desert. Asuka throws herself onto a plastic seat, grateful for the shade. Shinji leans up against a pole to her right. It's not very crowded. Most people have the good sense to stay inside. Most people have working air conditioners. Most people are competent, well-adjusted adults. The cicadas are very loud, an insistent buzzing, saturating everything. She thinks of Germany, of Berlin. They weren't as loud there. It wasn't as hot. Not for the first time, she feels a slight pang of homesickness. She shifts her legs and grimaces. She's sweating like a pig. The plastic is slick where her thighs were resting on it.  
火车站出现在他们面前，就像沙漠中的绿洲。明日香把自己扔到塑料座椅上，感谢那里的阴凉。真嗣靠在她右边的一根杆子上。它不是很拥挤。大多数人都有很好的意识呆在里面。大多数人都有工作空调。大多数人都是有能力、适应良好的成年人。蝉的声音非常响亮，持续不断的嗡嗡声，充满了一切。她想到了德国，想到了柏林。他们那里没有那么吵。天气没有那么热。这不是第一次，她感到一阵轻微的思乡之情。她挪动双腿，做个鬼脸。她汗流浃背，像猪一样。塑料在她的大腿搁在上面的地方很光滑。

"Hey, Asuka," Shinji murmurs. She looks at him. He's looking at the empty train tracks, brow slightly furrowed. "What do you think winter was like?"  
“嘿，明日香，”真嗣喃喃自语。她看着他。他看着空荡荡的火车轨道，眉头微微皱起。“你觉得冬天是什么样子的？”

"Heaven, probably," she grumbles.  
“天堂，也许吧，”她抱怨道。

That provokes a laugh. "It's so hard to imagine," says Shinji. "The air being that cold. To the point it could kill you."  
这引起了一阵笑声。“这太难想象了，”真嗣说。“空气太冷了。到了可以杀了你的地步。

Asuka stretches. "Mm. Dying of cold sounds pretty nice right now. Better than melting into a puddle of goo."  
明日香伸了个懒腰。“嗯，死于寒冷现在听起来很不错。总比融化成一滩粘液要好。

"It's winter in the southern hemisphere, isn't it? Let's go to Australia."  
“现在是南半球的冬天，不是吗？我们去澳大利亚吧。

She snorts. "Sure, Third. The train will take us all the way there."  
她哼了一声。“当然，第三。火车会带我们一路到那里。

"Not right now! I meant…later…maybe…"  
“现在不行！我的意思是......后。。。也许......”

The train appears. The doors open with a hiss and a wave of crisp, air-conditioned air pours out. Asuka and Shinji sigh in unison. They sit side by side on the bench. Asuka leans back, crossing her arms behind her head and stretching her legs out in front of her. Afternoon sunlight streams through the windows, painting everything with warm golds. She peers at Shinji out of the corner of her eye. _Later maybe, eh?_ She turns her gaze to the ceiling. If she went to Australia…no way would NERV let them go. Because of Eva. But if there were no Eva…no Eva…if there were no Eva she wouldn't be a pilot anymore. And if she wasn't a pilot…  
火车出现了。门发出嘶嘶声打开，一股清脆的空调空气涌出。明日香和真嗣异口同声叹息。他们并排坐在长凳上。明日香向后靠，双臂交叉在脑后，双腿在身前伸展。午后的阳光从窗户洒进来，把一切都涂上了温暖的金色。她用眼角的余光凝视着真嗣。也许以后，嗯？她把目光转向天花板。如果她去了澳大利亚......NERV绝不会放过他们。因为伊娃。但是如果没有伊娃......没有伊娃...如果没有伊娃，她就不会再当飞行员了。如果她不是飞行员......

Asuka frowns. No point in thinking of useless impossibilities. She's the best pilot and therefore necessary, always and forever.  
明日香皱起眉头。考虑无用的不可能是没有意义的。她是最好的飞行员，因此永远是必要的。

They get off near the airport. It's much more crowded this close to downtown. People are everywhere, walking, skipping, running. A sea of dark hair and bright clothes, the susurration of humanity punctuated by music, laughter, too-loud voices. Smells, too: food, body odor, melting asphalt. She inhales, wrinkling her nose. The whole scene shimmers, cooking gently in the heat.  
他们在机场附近下车。离市中心这么近的地方要拥挤得多。人们无处不在，走路、跳跃、奔跑。一片黑发和鲜艳衣物的海洋，人性的救赎被音乐、笑声和过于响亮的声音所打断。气味也一样：食物、体味、融化的沥青。她吸了一口气，皱了皱鼻子。整个场景闪闪发光，在热量中轻轻地烹饪。

"Where are we going?" asks Shinji. He looks a little nervous, limbs tucked close to his body. Asuka fights the urge to roll her eyes. He's the pilot of a giant war machine, and crowds like this make him _nervous?_ She reaches out and closes her fingers around his wrist and tugs him along behind her, so he doesn't let himself get swept away.  
“我们要去哪里？”真嗣问道。他看起来有点紧张，四肢紧紧地贴着他的身体。明日香强忍着翻白眼的冲动。他是巨型战争机器的飞行员，这样的人群让他紧张吗？她伸出手，用手指搂住他的手腕，把他拉到身后，这样他就不会让自己被卷走。

"There's a nice ice cream shop around here. I've been once or twice."  
“这附近有一家不错的冰淇淋店。我去过一两次。

They walk side by side down the sidewalk, weaving through people. Asuka does her best not to bump against anyone, disgusted at the mental image of their sweat, their stink, their essence, freely soaking into her clothes, brushing her bare legs. Her hand creeps up Shinji's arm, tugging him closer, because he keeps lagging, and it's slowing them down. Finally, blessedly, they reach the ice cream shop. To Asuka's dismay it's filled to bursting with people. There's nowhere to sit, but damn it if she didn't come all this way. She takes a deep breath and plunges inside. The door bell tinkles entirely too cheerily.  
他们并肩走在人行道上，穿梭在人群中。明日香尽量不撞到任何人，对他们的汗水、臭味、本质的心理形象感到厌恶，这些汗水、臭味、精华随意地浸透在她的衣服里，刷着她裸露的双腿。她的手爬上真嗣的胳膊，把他拉得更近，因为他一直落后，这让他们慢了下来。最后，幸运的是，他们到达了冰淇淋店。令明日香沮丧的是，这里挤满了人。没有地方可以坐，但如果她不是一路走来，那就该死了。她深吸一口气，一头扎进去。门铃叮叮当当的声音太欢快了。

The noise inside is incredible. The press of the crowd forces them to stand close together. She sighs, feeling her shoulder blade bump against Shinji's chest. Someone passes too close by her and she leans back on instinct, further into him. His left hand comes up, resting lightly on the side of her shoulder through her t-shirt, steadying them both.  
里面的噪音令人难以置信。人群的压力迫使他们站得很近。她叹了口气，感觉到自己的肩胛骨撞在真嗣的胸膛上。有人从她身边经过太近，她本能地靠向他，更深入地向他靠。他的左手伸出来，隔着她的T恤轻轻地放在她的肩膀一侧，稳住了他们俩。

They order. Once they get their ice cream they emerge by mutual unspoken agreement back into the street.  
他们订购。一旦他们拿到冰淇淋，他们就会通过双方的不言而喻的协议回到街上。

"Ahh," sighs Asuka, "I didn't think it'd be so crowded…how disappointing! That's no way to treat your Eva pilots."  
“啊，”明日香叹了口气，“我没想到会这么拥挤......多么令人失望！那可不是善待你的Eva飞行员的办法。

Shinji hums in assent. "The ice cream is delicious, though."  
真嗣哼哼着表示同意。“不过，冰淇淋很好吃。”

"Yep, so I'll let it slide this time."  
“是的，所以这次我就让它滑了。”

The roar of a jet engine fills the air. Asuka and Shinji look up, squinting. The big, bulky cargo jet sails serenely over them, obscured slightly by tangled power lines and signs and stumpy buildings. It's so close yet still untouchable. Removed. Above it all. To something like that all the humans below are as ants. Asuka rocks onto her tiptoes. Contemplates reaching upwards and running a finger along its underbelly. Out of all these people, she could do it. She and the boy beside her.  
空气中弥漫着喷气发动机的轰鸣声。明日香和真嗣抬起头，眯着眼睛。这架巨大而笨重的货机平静地航行在他们上方，被纠结的电线、标志和崎岖不平的建筑物稍微遮住了。它是如此接近，但仍然不可触碰。删除。最重要的是。对于这样的事情，下面的所有人类都像蚂蚁一样。明日香踮起脚尖。考虑向上伸手，用手指沿着它的下腹部滑行。在所有这些人中，她能做到。她和她旁边的男孩。

He's an inch shorter than her. He nudges her with his sharp, bony elbow. "Hey…there's a laundromat across the street. Wanna just eat in there?"  
他比她矮一英寸。他用他锋利、骨瘦如柴的手肘轻推她。“嘿......街对面有一家自助洗衣店。想在里面吃东西吗？

"It's better than standing out here."  
“总比在这里脱颖而出要好。”

The inside is a bit dingy, but there's not very many people inside and she and Shinji are quickly able to find seats. She licks her strawberry cone and listens to the whirr of the machines and watches people walk blithely by. The people of Tokyo-3, that blocky, austere, military city that's on the edge of its seat, braced for the destruction of everything it knows and loves. She's one of three things between it and that destruction. Her life. Her _self._ All of her being hangs in the balance, always, burning, waiting, straining. Ready. None of that is reflected in those people out there, on their smiling faces. Do any of them recognize her? Can any of them imagine what it's _like?_  
里面有点肮脏，但里面的人并不多，她和真嗣很快就找到了座位。她舔着草莓蛋筒，听着机器的嗡嗡声，看着人们轻快地走过。Tokyo-3 的人民，那个块状、朴素的军事城市，正处于座位的边缘，准备摧毁它所知道和热爱的一切。她是介于它和那种毁灭之间的三件事之一。她的生活。她的自我。她所有的存在都悬在天平上，总是在燃烧，等待，紧张。准备。这些都没有反映在那些人身上，反映在他们的笑脸上。他们中有人认得她吗？他们中的任何一个人都能想象它是什么样子吗？

She looks at Shinji, quietly eating his green matcha ice cream. He's looking at his sandaled feet, kicked out in front of him. Not paying attention to anything. Eyes far away. She sighs through her nose and shakes her head.  
她看着真嗣，静静地吃着他的绿色抹茶冰淇淋。他看着自己被踢出的双脚。什么都不注意。目光远方。她用鼻子叹了口气，摇了摇头。

"Idiot," she murmurs. “白痴，”她喃喃自语。

He doesn't look at her.  
他不看她。

### Side B

Misato Katsuragi kneels among the scattered cans of Yebisu like a general mourning her fallen soldiers. Or perhaps an acolyte at the altar of her slain god. In her exhaustion her anger has given way to a disappointment so profound it makes a part of her wonder distantly if, in fact, she does have a problem. She picks up a gleaming yellow can. It's heavy in her hand. She can feel the liquid sloshing beneath the lukewarm metal skin. And while she may be lackadaisical and carefree in most areas of her life, there are two things she takes seriously: her job and her alcohol. And she isn't so desperate as to stoop to drinking _lukewarm_ beer. With a regretful sigh, she sets the can back down among its fallen brethren.  
桂木美里跪在散落的惠比寿罐头中，像将军哀悼她阵亡的士兵一样。或者也许是她被杀的神的祭坛上的侍僧。在她疲惫不堪的时候，她的愤怒已经让位于一种如此深刻的失望，以至于她想知道，如果她真的有问题的话，她就会感到遥远。她拿起一个闪闪发光的黄色罐子。它在她的手里很重。她能感觉到液体在温热的金属皮肤下晃动。虽然她在生活的大部分方面可能都是懒散和无忧无虑的，但她认真对待两件事：她的工作和她的酒精。而且她并没有绝望到弯腰喝温啤酒。她遗憾地叹了口气，将罐子放回倒下的弟兄们中间。

God. It's so _hot_ in here. Her armpits and the backs of her knees are soaked already. Her skin crawls beneath her clothes. She looks up at the air conditioning unit, remembering with sudden cold dread that Shinji had mentioned that neither of them were working properly. She heaves herself to her feet and trudges to the living room and audibly groans at the sight that greets her. The windows are covered in foil on the _inside_. The door is also covered in foil and shut tight.  
神。这里太热了。她的腋窝和膝盖后部已经湿透了。她的皮肤在她的衣服下面爬行。她抬头看了看空调机组，突然感到恐惧，想起真嗣曾提到过他们俩都没有正常工作。她蹒跚地站起来，跋涉到客厅，一看到映入眼帘的景象，她就会发出呻吟声。窗户的内部覆盖着铝箔纸。门也用箔纸覆盖并紧闭。

"_Damn_ it!" she wails. “该死的！”她嚎啕大哭。

By the end of it, all the foil is crumpled on the ground and Misato's clothes are too. She stands slouched in the living room in nothing but her panties, by now very irritated. She flings open the patio door, and the living room windows, and the window in her bedroom. She slumps against the wall beneath the latter, her arms dangling outside, the sill digging into her cheek. The air almost feels cooler than it does inside the apartment. _Damn_ those Children. Actually – _Child,_ singular. She grits her teeth. It was obviously Asuka who came up with the brilliant idea to take a nap in the fridge. She'd bet money that it was Asuka who put the foil on the inside of the windows as well. She curses the girl's pigheadedness as she flops down on top of her futon. If it was just Misato and Shinji in the apartment, this wouldn't have happened. Shinji is a good boy. Respectful. Sensible. Not prone to letting his hardworking guardian's beer get warm and running up the electric bill out of sheer spite.  
到最后，所有的箔纸都皱巴巴地躺在地上，美里的衣服也皱了。她懒洋洋地站在客厅里，只穿着内裤，现在非常烦躁。她甩开了露台的门，客厅的窗户，以及她卧室的窗户。她瘫倒在后者下方的墙上，双臂悬在外面，窗台钻进她的脸颊。空气几乎感觉比公寓内凉爽。该死的那些孩子。实际上 - 孩子，单数。她咬紧牙关。显然，是明日香想出了一个绝妙的主意，在冰箱里小睡一会儿。她敢打赌，是明日香把铝箔贴在窗户内侧的。她诅咒这个女孩的猪头，她扑通一声倒在被褥上。如果公寓里只有美里和真嗣，这就不会发生。真嗣是个好孩子。尊敬的。懂事。他不愿意让他勤劳的监护人的啤酒变热，并且出于纯粹的恶意而增加电费。

Briefly, she imagines what it would be like to kick Asuka out of the apartment permanently, and then feels immediately guilty at the thought. It was Shinji, after all, who'd covered himself in her beer cans.  
简而言之，她想象着将明日香永久赶出公寓会是什么样子，然后一想到这个想法就立即感到内疚。毕竟是真嗣，她把自己盖在她的啤酒罐里。

She rolls over. The sheets cling unpleasantly to her bare skin. After a moment's deliberation, she kicks them away. The open air isn't much better, dense and humid and smothering. Exhaustion claws at her eyelids, makes her limbs heavy and her mind foggy. But sleep eludes her. She tosses and turns, falling briefly into sticky semi-consciousness until the sensation of falling has her jerking awake. Far away, a bird is calling, the sound echoing into the muddled depths of her. No breeze comes through the window to provide relief. At last she gives up, rolling onto her back and staring blearily up at a now-familiar ceiling illuminated with the reddish-gold light of late afternoon.  
她翻了个身。床单不愉快地粘在她裸露的皮肤上。经过片刻的考虑，她把他们踢开了。露天也好不到哪里去，密集、潮湿、令人窒息。疲惫的爪子抓着她的眼睑，使她的四肢沉重，头脑模糊。但她却无法入睡。她辗转反侧，短暂地陷入粘稠的半昏迷状态，直到跌倒的感觉让她的抽搐清醒。远处，一只鸟在叫，声音回荡在她浑浊的深处。没有微风从窗户进来提供缓解。最后，她放弃了，翻身躺在地上，呆呆地盯着现在熟悉的天花板，天花板被傍晚时分的红金色光芒照亮。

She swallows. She'd really, _really_ like a beer right now.  
她咽了咽口水。她现在真的非常非常喜欢喝啤酒。

She puts on a tank top and shorts and gathers her hair in a ponytail. There's a convenience store a short walk from the apartment building. When she emerges into the dining room, Pen-Pen is standing amongst the cans. He looks up at her and _warks_ morosely.  
她穿上背心和短裤，把头发扎成马尾辫。公寓楼距离便利店仅几步之遥。当她走进餐厅时，Pen-Pen正站在罐子中间。他抬头看着她，闷闷不乐地扭动着身子。

"Why didn't you stop them?" Misato asks.  
“你为什么不阻止他们？”美里问道。

He gives her a flat look, and she musters an exhalation of a laugh. "Yeah, I don't blame you. Asuka probably would've punted you if you tried."  
他平淡地看了她一眼，她忍不住笑了起来。“是啊，我不怪你。如果你试过的话，明日香可能会打你一顿。

He makes an indignant noise. She reaches down and tickles the penguin under his beak. "Chin up. I'm going to go get more beer from the store right now. I'll be back soon, okay?"  
他发出愤怒的声音。她伸手去挠他喙下的企鹅。“抬起头来。我现在要去商店买更多的啤酒。我很快就会回来的，好吗？

He tweets at her and gently nips her wrist before waddling back to his fridge. She grabs her keys and wallet and sets off on her mission.  
他对她叽叽喳喳地叫着，轻轻地咬了咬她的手腕，然后蹒跚地回到冰箱前。她拿起钥匙和钱包，开始执行任务。

Outside, the cicadas are whirring in the trees. They've been whirring for years and years now, a machine uninterrupted. Gaining energy instead of deteriorating. She frowns. Everything is so _green._ Foliage bursts from between the buildings, worms its way into the cracks that have already formed in the bright shiny pavement of this bright shiny city. Cancerous, almost; in summer, everything grows, and grows itself to death. She thinks, suddenly, of apples. She hasn't had one in a long time. The fruit was one of the many casualties of Second Impact; it doesn't get cold enough here in Japan anymore. She licks her lips and tastes salt. This time of year used to be fall, almost winter. She looks upward at the distant green mountains and tries to imagine them painted in the reds and golds of autumn. The grass would be dry and crackly. The air would be cold and nippy on her cheeks.  
外面，蝉在树上嗡嗡作响。他们已经嗡嗡作响了好几年了，一台机器不间断。获得能量而不是恶化。她皱起眉头。一切都是那么绿色。树叶从建筑物之间迸发而出，蠕虫进入这座明亮闪亮的城市明亮闪亮的人行道上已经形成的裂缝。癌性，几乎;在夏天，万物都会生长，并且会自行生长到死亡。突然间，她想到了苹果。她已经很久没有吃过了。水果是第二次撞击的众多伤亡者之一;在日本，天气已经不够冷了。她舔了舔嘴唇，尝了尝盐的味道。每年的这个时候曾经是秋天，几乎是冬天。她仰望远处的青山，试图想象它们被秋天的红色和金色所描绘。草会干燥而噼啪作响。空气会很冷，很刺鼻地打在她的脸颊上。

She sighs. Autumn was a long time ago. Far away from Tokyo-3.  
她叹了口气。秋天是很久以前的事了。远离东京-3。

She's arrived at the convenience store. The bell tinkles merrily as she pushes her way through the doors. Cold air washes over her and she's not able to suppress a whine of relief. She's fairly quick in her shopping, grabbing two six-packs of Yebisu and a few instant meals as an afterthought. Who knows when the kids will be home?  
她已经到了便利店。铃铛欢快地叮叮当当，她推门而入。冷空气冲刷着她，她无法抑制一丝如释重负的呜咽。她购物的速度相当快，事后才想吃两瓶六包的惠比寿和几顿速食。谁知道孩子们什么时候会回家？

The walk back to her apartment is much quicker, the distance on foot now a known quantity.  
走回她公寓的速度要快得多，步行的距离现在已经是已知的数量了。

"I'm home!" she announces. She wrinkles her nose. Maybe it's gotten a little cooler in here. It's hard to tell. Pen-Pen's door opens and he waddles up to her, blinking expectantly. He's already got a straw in his claws.  
“我到家了！”她宣布。她皱了皱鼻子。也许这里变得凉爽一些。这很难说。Pen-Pen的门打开了，他摇摇晃晃地走到她面前，期待地眨了眨眼。他的爪子里已经有一根稻草了。

She extricates a can from its fellows and hands it to the bird. "Sorry, it probably warmed up a little on the way back."  
她从同伴中取出一个罐子，递给鸟。“对不起，回来的路上可能有点暖和了。”

He just _warks_ at her and opens the can. The distinctive click-hiss fills the quiet in the apartment. Then her roommate waddles back into his chilly abode. Misato sighs and smiles, shaking her head as she begins restocking her refrigerator. She can't blame him for not wanting to stay out here and drink with her. It's too hot, even for a hot springs penguin.  
他只是朝她眨了笑，然后打开了罐子。独特的咔哒声充满了公寓的宁静。然后她的室友蹒跚地回到他寒冷的住所。美里叹了口气，笑了笑，摇了摇头，开始补充冰箱。她不能怪他不想留在这里和她一起喝酒。太热了，即使对于温泉企鹅来说也是如此。

She sits down at the dining room table and chugs a can in one go. The noise that comes out when she finishes is less of a shriek and more of a groan, weighed down by the heat and the less-than-crisp quality of the beer. She opens another can and sips at it, slower this time. The quiet settles in. She can hear the hum of both the refrigerators. The air is still. The sun is going down; she can see the muted glow of it through the doorway to the living room. Through the open windows comes the sound of cicadas. Mundane and real, contrasting utterly with ice and snow and the piercing otherworldly shriek that she still hears in her dreams.  
她坐在餐桌旁，一口气喝了一罐。当她喝完时发出的声音与其说是尖叫，不如说是呻吟，被高温和啤酒不那么脆的质量所压倒。她打开另一个罐头，啜了一口，这次慢了一点。宁静安顿下来。她能听到两个冰箱的嗡嗡声。空气是静止的。太阳快下山了;她可以通过通往客厅的门口看到它柔和的光芒。透过敞开的窗户传来蝉鸣的声音。平凡而真实，与冰雪和她在梦中仍然听到的刺耳的超凡脱俗的尖叫形成鲜明对比。

Misato drinks more beer. 美里喝更多的啤酒。

Asuka and Shinji have never tasted an apple. Never known a change in season. Never felt true, deadly cold. To them those things are just abstractions, inconsequential yet incomprehensible. Her two wards are about the age she was when she last felt winter's bite. Misato watches Asuka, sometimes, her slender birdlike limbs, her blue eyes wide in a face still soft with puppy fat, and wonders: _was I ever that small? that fragile?_ She thinks she still is, sometimes, and that scares her. The catatonic girl, lurking just beneath the surface. The fearful, abandoned child, always crying. She thinks of Shinji, then, and bites her lip.  
明日香和真嗣从未尝过苹果的味道。从来不知道季节的变化。从未感到真实，致命的寒冷。对他们来说，这些东西只是抽象的，无关紧要但又难以理解。她的两个病房与她上次感受到冬天的叮咬时的年龄差不多。美里有时看着明日香，她纤细的鸟一样的四肢，她的蓝眼睛睁得大大的，脸上仍然带着小狗的脂肪，她想知道：我有那么小吗？那么脆弱？她觉得自己有时还是这样，这让她感到害怕。那个紧张症的女孩，就潜伏在表面之下。那个可怕的，被遗弃的孩子，总是哭泣。然后，她想到了真嗣，咬了咬嘴唇。

The weight of her years, trailing after her on her way to the store, settles heavily on her shoulders now that she's not in motion, now that there's no noise to drown it out. She'll be twenty-nine this December. Twenty-nine minus fourteen is fifteen. Fifteen long years of summer, a span of time stretched far beyond its breaking point. She spent it talking and not talking, and getting drunk, and graduating college, and joining the military, and travelling the world, and running. Chasing. Fleeing. She thinks of Kaji, suddenly, the way he gripped her, the way he kissed her. Almost desperately. Even though she probably tasted like vomit. His unfamiliar stubble. Unfamiliar. Familiar. Pull and push and pull, like the moon to the ocean. There was a sob stuck in her throat, and he caught it in his mouth.  
在她去商店的路上，岁月的重担紧紧地跟在她身后，现在她没有运动，现在没有噪音可以淹没它，她沉重地落在了她的肩膀上。今年12月，她将年满29岁。二十九减去十四就是十五。漫长的十五年夏天，时间跨度远远超出了它的临界点。她花了很多时间说话，不说话，喝醉了，大学毕业了，参军了，环游世界，跑步了。追。逃离。她突然想起了Kaji，他抓住她的方式，他亲吻她的方式。几乎是绝望的。尽管她可能尝起来像呕吐物。他不熟悉的胡茬。陌生。熟悉。拉啊拉啊拉，就像月亮对海洋一样。她的喉咙里卡着一声抽泣，他把它含在嘴里。

She can feel her heartbeat in her throat. The quiet apartment has nothing to give her. She goes to the phone.  
她能感觉到自己的心跳在喉咙里。安静的公寓没有什么可以给她的。她去接电话。

He picks up on the third ring. "Hey, Kaji," says Misato. "Let's go out." She hopes she doesn't sound desperate.  
他在第三枚戒指上捡起。“嘿，Kaji，”Misato说。“我们出去吧。”她希望自己听起来不会绝望。

"I'd be honored," says the voice on the phone, made tinny with distance. There's a teasing lilt to it. "How about I come pick you up?"  
“我会很荣幸的，”电话里的声音说，随着距离的增加而变得微不足道。它有一种戏谑的轻快。“我来接你怎么样？”

"You don't have to. I'm not going to drink that much."  
“你不必这样做。我不会喝那么多。

"That's what you always say."  
“你总是这么说的。”

"Oh, shut up. Let me put some clothes on. See you soon."  
“哦，闭嘴。让我穿些衣服。再见。

"Heh, Katsuragi, does that mean you're – "  
“呵呵，桂木，那你是不是——”

She hangs up before he can finish the sentence.  
她还没来得及说完这句话，她就挂断了电话。

Immediately, she becomes conscious of how sweaty she is, how sticky she feels, how smelly she must be, and laments her weakness. Oh well, nothing for it now. She gets up and splashes some water on her face and underarms. Brushes her teeth. Applies liberal amounts of deodorant. After much deliberation, she picks an outfit. The doorbell rings right as she finishes spritzing her perfume.  
立刻，她意识到自己汗流浃背，感觉很粘，一定很臭，并感叹自己的软弱。哦，好吧，现在没什么了。她站起来，把一些水泼在脸上和腋下。刷牙。使用大量除臭剂。经过深思熟虑，她挑选了一套衣服。门铃响了，她刚喷完香水。

"I'm almost ready," she says when she answers, before turning and bustling back towards her room.  
“我快准备好了，”她回答说，然后转身匆匆忙忙地回到她的房间。

Kaji hums thoughtfully, trailing in her wake. "Hello to you too. Say, Katsuragi, why are there beer cans all over your floor?"  
Kaji若有所思地哼了一声，跟在她身后。“你好也一样。说，桂木，为什么你的地板上到处都是啤酒罐？

She _tsks._ "You can thank Asuka for that one," she says, leaving Kaji in the kitchen and shutting the door to her room. "When I got home I found her _napping_ in the open refrigerator! And Shinji had covered himself in those cans."  
她啧啧称奇。“你可以感谢明日香，”她说，把Kaji留在厨房里，关上了她房间的门。“当我回到家时，我发现她在敞开的冰箱里打盹！真嗣把自己盖在那些罐子里。

"Asuka? Shinji?" Kaji calls. "Is this true?"  
“明日香？真嗣？Kaji打来电话。“这是真的吗？”

"They're not here," Misato grumbles, reappearing in the doorway to the kitchen. "I, ah. Might have kicked them out."  
“他们不在这里，”美里抱怨着，再次出现在厨房的门口。“我，啊。可能已经把他们赶出去了。

Kaji raises an eyebrow. "Is that so?"  
Kaji挑了挑眉。“是这样吗？”

"Listen, it was a long, frustrating day. Paperwork out the _ass._ And then I come home and the air conditioners are broken and there's no cold beer." She sighs, drawing a hand down her face. "Look, whenever they come back, which they will, I'll let them in. I'm not totally heartless."  
“听着，这是漫长而令人沮丧的一天。文书工作，屁股。然后我回到家，空调坏了，没有冰镇啤酒。她叹了口气，把一只手从脸上拉下来。“听着，每当他们回来时，他们会的，我会让他们进来。我不是完全无情的。

"So we have the place to ourselves, eh?" Kaji loops an arm around her waist and draws her close to him. She puts up a token resistance, more to provoke him than anything else, and his grip on her tightens. Their mouths collide. The kiss is hot, wet, his tongue in her mouth, his stubble scraping her cheeks. She makes a high, breathy noise before she can stop herself, her arms snaking around his body. One of his hands slips beneath her top. It's pleasantly rough and very warm. Too warm. She shivers a little and breaks the kiss.  
“所以我们有自己的地方，嗯？”Kaji用一只胳膊环住她的腰，把她拉近他。她象征性地反抗，更多的是挑衅他，而他对她的控制更紧了。他们的嘴巴相撞。这个吻是热的，湿的，他的舌头在她的嘴里，他的胡茬刮着她的脸颊。在她停下来之前，她发出了高亢的呼吸声，她的胳膊蜿蜒在他的身体上。他的一只手滑到她的上衣下面。它令人愉快地粗糙，非常温暖。太热了。她打了个寒颤，打断了这个吻。

"Not here," she murmurs. "The kids could…mmh…"  
“不在这里，”她喃喃自语。“孩子们可以......嗯......”

His hand leaves her top. Wanders lower. In the distance, a train horn blares.  
他的手离开了她的上衣。徘徊得更低。远处，火车喇叭声响起。

The light streaming through the living room windows is dimmer when they finish. The kitchen is shrouded in shadow. Kaji's warmth against her is suddenly unbearable. She places her palms flat against his chest and pushes him gently away from her.  
当它们结束时，从客厅窗户射出的光线变得更暗。厨房笼罩在阴影中。梶对她的温暖顿时让人难以忍受。她将手掌平放在他的胸膛上，轻轻地将他推开。

"It's awful in here," she sighs. She straightens her skirt, wipes her sweaty face. Sniffs her armpits and wrinkles her nose.  
“这里太可怕了，”她叹了口气。她拉直裙子，擦拭汗流浃背的脸。嗅了嗅她的腋窝，皱了皱她的鼻子。

The tinkling noise of Kaji fastening his belt sounds louder than it otherwise would in the quiet apartment. His eyes glitter in the dimness. He offers her his arm. "Shall we?"  
Kaji系腰带的叮叮当当的声音听起来比在安静的公寓里要响亮。他的眼睛在昏暗中闪闪发光。他向她伸出手臂。“好吗？”

She swats it, more than a little playfully, and starts walking towards the door. It's only then that she notices the beer cans. They're not on the floor, instead stacked neatly on the kitchen counter.  
她轻拍了一下，略带戏谑，然后开始向门口走去。直到那时，她才注意到啤酒罐。它们不在地板上，而是整齐地堆放在厨房柜台上。

They'd gone to a sushi place much like this one once before, a long time ago now. It was when they were still in college, on the way to the beach. It had only been a weekend trip, but it still stands out fondly in Misato's mind. She smiles, remembering.  
他们以前去过一家寿司店，很像这家店，很久以前了。那是他们还在上大学的时候，在去海滩的路上。这只是一次周末的旅行，但它仍然在美里的脑海中深深地突出。她微笑着，回忆着。

"What are you thinking about, Katsuragi?" Kaji asks, nudging her leg with his foot beneath the table.  
“葛城，你在想什么？”Kaji问道，用脚在桌子下面轻推她的腿。

She looks up at him. The smile stays on her face. "Remember that trip we took? To Okinawa? You and me and Ritsuko. Heh. We should have called her tonight, for old times' sake."  
她抬头看着他。笑容一直停留在她的脸上。“还记得我们去的那次旅行吗？去冲绳？你、我和律子。嘿。我们今晚应该给她打电话，看在旧时光的份上。

"Ah, when we tried going fishing and she ended up catching that gigantic sea bass and you didn't catch anything?"  
“啊，当我们试着去钓鱼时，她最后钓到了那条巨大的鲈鱼，而你什么也没钓到？”

Her face dissolves into a pout and she kicks him as he laughs. It's an old, easy rhythm, however much she wants to pretend otherwise. Kaji has changed, and she has changed, but them, here, now, is almost like picking up where they left off. But they aren't, are they? Not really. Perhaps not ever. She remembers pressing a gun to the back of his skull. _If you keep doing this other job, you'll die._  
她的脸化成一个噘嘴，在他笑的时候踢了他一脚。这是一种古老而轻松的节奏，无论她多么想假装不是这样。Kaji变了，她也变了，但他们，现在，现在，几乎就像从他们离开的地方开始。但事实并非如此，不是吗？没有。也许永远不会。她记得用枪指着他的后脑勺。如果你继续做其他工作，你就会死。

"Yes," says Kaji, smiling fondly. "I remember. Wanting to go again, is that it?"  
“是的，”Kaji说，带着深情的微笑。“我记得。想再去一次，就这样吗？

She snorts. "That might be…nice, but an angel could attack anytime. I can't leave the city. And I doubt I could pry Ritsuko away from her work for long enough."  
她哼了一声。“那可能是......很好，但天使随时可能攻击。我不能离开这个城市。我怀疑我能否把律子从她的工作中撬开足够长的时间。

She grimaces. _The Commander and Ritchan are hiding things from you too, and…_  
她做了个鬼脸。指挥官和里钦也在向你隐瞒事情，而且......

She thinks of a bloated white giant, crucified over a sea of LCL, and she reaches for her cocktail. The piercing screech at the end of the world, slashed across her sternum. Hanging over them both, even now.  
她想到了一个臃肿的白色巨人，被钉在LCL的海洋上，她伸手去拿她的鸡尾酒。世界末日的刺耳尖叫，划过她的胸骨。即使是现在，也笼罩着他们俩。

"Ah," sighs Kaji, "that's too bad. To be young and carefree again. I hope Asuka and Shinji realize what they have."  
“啊，”梶叹了口气，“这太糟糕了。再次变得年轻，无忧无虑。我希望明日香和真嗣意识到他们所拥有的。

She sighs. "Those two will be the death of me, I swear. It's always something. They're not going to realize anything until they grow up and become just like us, sitting here yammering about the past."  
她叹了口气。“我发誓，那两个人将是我的死。它总是一些东西。他们不会意识到任何事情，直到他们长大并变得像我们一样，坐在这里喋喋不休地谈论过去。

"Looking at them does remind me a bit of you and I, now that I think about it…"  
“看着他们确实让我想起了你和我，现在回想起来......”

"Hmph. Maybe a little too much so."  
“哼。也许有点过分了。

Kaji smiles. It's almost sad. "Tell me more about that day of work of yours."  
Kaji微笑着说。这几乎是可悲的。“跟我说说你那天的工作吧。”

She groans and obliges him. It's a relief to fill the air with something inane. Something tangible.  
她呻吟着，答应了他。用一些疯狂的东西填充空气是一种解脱。有形的东西。

Time, she thinks, watching Kaji eating his sushi, is a flat circle. Her father, sitting across from her, passing his burdens down onto her. And she, placing her burdens onto Shinji. Onto Asuka. She stuffs a segment of fish in her mouth and fights a sudden, insane urge to giggle. It's terrible. She's terrible. She's drunk. The surroundings and the man in front of her waver, dreamlike.  
时间，她想，看着Kaji吃他的寿司，是一个扁平的圆。她的父亲坐在她对面，把他的重担推给她。而她，把她的重担推给了真嗣。到明日香。她把一段鱼塞进嘴里，强忍着突然的、疯狂的傻笑冲动。太可怕了。她太可怕了。她喝醉了。周围的环境和她面前的男人摇摇晃晃，如梦似幻。

"Something wrong?" asks Kaji.  
“有什么不对吗？”Kaji问。

She swallows her fish. Shakes her head. "No. It's nothing."  
她吞下了她的鱼。摇摇头。“不。这没什么。

He doesn't press her. 他没有逼迫她。

/

"Hey," she mumbles. "Pull over."  
“嘿，”她咕哝着。“靠边停车。”

"Need to throw up?" Kaji asks lightly.  
“需要吐吗？”梶淡淡地问道。

"No." She swats him. "Not here. In that parking lot."  
“没有。”她打了他一巴掌。“不在这里。在那个停车场。

The parking lot is right next to the lake. There are no other cars. She watches the water shimmer lazily. Buildings jut upwards all around them. Lights pulse slowly on the opposite shore. A police siren sounds in the distance. Kaji has rolled the windows partway down, and the night air is warm and sticky against her skin, like stale beer. She leans over the console and grabs his arm, not looking at him. He's so solid against her. So real. He smells like sweat and aftershave, the same one he used to use when they lived together. Something flutters in her chest. It's not quite fear, not quite longing. She thinks of her father. There one moment, gone the next. If she concentrates hard enough, she thinks she could curl her fingers around all of this – the lake, the man, the ache inside her – and clutch it tightly to herself. Make time stop through sheer force of will.  
停车场就在湖边。没有其他汽车。她懒洋洋地看着水面波光粼粼。建筑物在它们周围向上突出。灯光在对岸缓缓跳动。远处响起警笛声。Kaji已经把窗户摇了下来，夜晚的空气温暖而粘稠地贴在她的皮肤上，就像陈旧的啤酒一样。她俯身在控制台上，抓住他的胳膊，没有看他。他对她如此坚决。太真实了。他闻起来像汗水和须后水，他们住在一起时他经常用的那种。有什么东西在她的胸膛里颤动。这不完全是恐惧，不完全是渴望。她想起了她的父亲。前一刻在那里，下一刻就消失了。如果她足够集中注意力，她认为她可以用手指缠绕着这一切——湖、男人、她内心的痛苦——并紧紧地抓住它。通过纯粹的意志力让时间停止。

She feels him take a breath, start to say something. Her grip tightens on his arm. "I don't want to go home just yet," she says, cutting across the beginnings of whatever he was going to tell her. At that, he sighs. A moment later his cheek comes to rest on top of her head.  
她感觉到他喘了口气，开始说些什么。她紧紧抓住他的胳膊。“我还不想回家，”她说，打断了他要告诉她的一切的开头。听到这话，他叹了口气。过了一会儿，他的脸颊停在她的头顶上。

"The trip," she murmurs. "Our last night there. When we stayed late on the beach and ate watermelon and got so drunk we ended up spending the night."  
“旅行，”她喃喃自语。“我们在那里的最后一晚。当我们在海滩上呆到很晚，吃了西瓜，喝醉了，我们最终过夜了。

He hums assent. "My throat hurt from laughing so much."  
他哼哼唧唧地表示同意。“我笑得够呛嗓子都疼。”

"It's still that same summer," she murmurs. "You know? But we're not those same people, are we?"  
“还是那个夏天，”她喃喃自语。“你知道吗？但我们不是同一个人，不是吗？

"Mm. Perhaps not." “嗯，也许不是。”

"I'm sorry." “对不起。”

"Don't be." “别这样。”

They tangle together in the back seat like teenagers. It's warm, comforting, familiar. Nostalgic. She can almost pretend. She's just using him, isn't she? Is that what's happening here? Her heart shudders. Kaji's body is heavy on top of hers, his stubble scraping against her neck. She doesn't know what he's thinking. Why he's indulging her. He feels so far away. She tightens her limbs around him, pulling him to her, arching her back so their fronts are pressed together. She doesn't know what else to do.  
他们像青少年一样在后座上纠缠在一起。它是温暖的，安慰的，熟悉的。怀乡。她几乎可以假装。她只是在利用他，不是吗？这就是这里发生的事情吗？她的心在颤抖。Kaji的身体沉重地压在她的身上，他的胡茬刮着她的脖子。她不知道他在想什么。他为什么要放纵她。他觉得自己离得很远。她收紧他的四肢，将他拉到她身边，拱起她的背部，使他们的前部压在一起。她不知道还能做什么。

/

When Misato finally comes home, light is spilling into the entryway from the kitchen. It's still stiflingly hot inside. Maybe it's gotten a little cooler. It's hard to tell. She's not sure she cares all that much at this point. She toes off her shoes, announces her presence in a soft voice, and then peers into the living room.  
当美里终于回到家时，光线正从厨房的入口洒进来。里面仍然热得令人窒息。也许它变得凉爽了一点。这很难说。她不确定自己现在是否那么在乎。她脱掉鞋子，用柔和的声音宣布她的存在，然后凝视着客厅。

Shinji is fast asleep on a futon in the middle of it. He's wearing a pair of shorts and nothing else. His earbuds are in, his SDAT player loosely clutched in one hand. She smiles, equal parts fond and exasperated. When she creeps past him to check on Asuka, she sees that her door is half open in hopes of tempting a breeze. Her room is illuminated by moonlight coming in through the open window. Asuka's lying on her side, her back to the door, snoring a little on top of the covers.  
真嗣在中间的被褥上睡着了。他穿着一条短裤，没有别的。他的耳塞戴着，一只手松散地握着他的SDAT播放器。她微笑着，既喜欢又愤怒。当她悄悄地从他身边走过去查看明日香时，她看到她的门半开着，希望能吹来一阵微风。她的房间被月光从敞开的窗户射进来照亮。明日香侧躺着，背对着门，在被子上打着鼾声。

It's easy, suddenly, to imagine a different life. To imagine that the girl on the bed is really her daughter, and the boy in the living room is really her son. In a moment, a pair of strong, warm arms will enclose her body, and she'll lean back and say something, and Kaji will laugh and tell her that they've really been up much too late, haven't they, and she'll never be lonely again. But she turns around and no one's there. The two children in the apartment will never be hers. She can hear the train signal pulsing in the distance. Her sigh is deep and barely audible. She's drunk. She's exhausted. She turns around and traipses towards her room. Maybe this time, she can finally fall asleep.  
突然之间，很容易想象出一种不同的生活。想象一下，床上的女孩真的是她的女儿，客厅里的男孩真的是她的儿子。一会儿，一双强壮、温暖的手臂会包裹住她的身体，她会向后靠着说些什么，而梶会笑着告诉她，他们真的已经起得太晚了，不是吗，她再也不会寂寞了。但她转过身来，没有人在那里。公寓里的两个孩子永远不会是她的。她能听到远处传来的火车信号。她的叹息很深，几乎听不见。她喝醉了。她已经筋疲力尽了。她转过身，朝自己的房间走去。也许这一次，她终于可以睡着了。

### Comment
[Born2Walken](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/15849647/Born2Walken): This was a definitely something different for a one shot in that its very much a little bit of slice of life that unlike many other more happier one offs could totally fit in the actual cannon of the show. Liked how it’s post episode 15 so you can see sparks of the beginning of the darker parts of the show but its just before everything really goes to shit so you its very melancholic in how it feels like this could be some of the last times the characters interact in that more innocent fashion as they often did in the action arc. Its entertaining seeing Shinji and Asuka’s goofy antics with the heat wave and you do a fantastic job of making us feel like were right there in the heat with them. Its also refreshing to see Asuka being the one to mess up the tin foil thing and feels very much like something she do in those middle episodes. Like to see that Shinji is still well enough to bite back here and that there’s some legit sexual tension in which both of them can’t awkwardly comprehend. Misato kicking them out is pretty cruel but I could see it happening. Its neat to see Asuka really contemplate her relevance and grapple with the fact shes not nearly appreciated for her service as she thought she be which is all the more sad in that Shinji is still unable to figure out how much she really longs for him.  
对于一个镜头来说，绝对别具一格，它以生活片段的形式呈现，与众多更为欢乐的单集不同，它完美融入了剧集的主线。喜欢它设定在第 15 集之后，此时剧集的阴暗面初露端倪，但尚未完全失控，因此带有一种忧郁感，仿佛这是角色们以纯真方式互动的最后时光，正如他们在行动篇章中常做的那样。看到真嗣和明日香在热浪中的搞笑行为十分有趣，你成功地让我们感同身受，仿佛置身于酷热之中。 看到明日香搞砸锡纸那件事，感觉非常像她在中间几集会做的事，这让人耳目一新。很高兴看到真嗣仍然足够坚强，能够在这里反击，而且他们之间确实存在一些他们无法尴尬理解的性紧张关系。美里把他们赶出去相当残忍，但我能想象到这种情况发生。看到明日香真正思考她的重要性并努力接受她没有像她想象的那样被感激的事实，这更加令人难过，因为真嗣仍然无法理解她对他有多么渴望。

This half was definitely more somber then the other. Cleaver use of dividing the parts with side a and b like a cassette tape as they both are very much their own thing. Was disappointed that we didnt get any resolve for the pilots but i understand what your trying to go for this story as again its suppose to be able to fit in to this point in the show. Some Misato’s best and most interesting moments come out of this point in time in the story and its cool to delve deeper into her thought process here. You really depict well that she’s really just as lost as her wards and the only difference being her age and lost of innocence. The Kaji love scenes are well done in that their passionate but also feel alittle hollow in that while they both care for each other they still can’t communicate properly and are essentially using each other. It really paints how tragic Misato really is as a character. All in all this isnt want I really look for in a Eva fic as its doesn’t have a bright piece of hope at the end but I still think its a excellent done fic that absolutely has a audience out their that can really enjoy it. You really are talented at writing fics and I do hope you write more!  
第二部分确实比另一部分更为沉重。通过 A 面和 B 面来划分内容，如同磁带一般，这种处理方式很巧妙，因为两者都极具独立性。对于故事中未能为飞行员提供解决方案感到遗憾，但我明白你在这篇故事中所追求的意图，它旨在融入剧集的这一时刻。在这个时间点上，Misato 展现出了她最精彩和引人入胜的时刻，深入挖掘她的内心世界非常有趣。你很好地描绘了她与她的监护人一样迷茫，唯一的区别在于她的年龄和失去的纯真。 《Kaji 的爱情场景处理得很好，既充满激情又略显空洞，因为他们虽然彼此关心，却无法有效沟通，本质上是在利用对方。这真正描绘了 Misato 作为一个角色的悲剧性。总的来说，这不是我在 Eva 同人中真正寻找的东西，因为它没有在结尾带来一丝希望，但我仍然认为这是一部完成得非常出色的作品，绝对有一群读者会真正喜欢它。你在写同人方面真的很有才华，我确实希望你能写出更多作品！

[YourBlandestNightmare](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/13453602/YourBlandestNightmare): Damn, your descriptions gave me flashbacks of the big heatwave we suffered this summer xD  
该死的，你的描述让我回想起了我们今年夏天遭受的大热浪 xD  
  
Great job. I loved the way you described the thoughts of the characters, how you've adressed their fears and doubts, and also their desires. Misato's nostalgia for the other seasons was very poignant, and with each summer getting hotter each year in real life, it hits close to home.  
干得好。我喜欢你描述角色想法的方式，你如何解决他们的恐惧和疑虑，以及他们的欲望。Misato 对过往季节的怀念之情尤为动人，而现实中每年夏天越来越热的现象，也让人深有感触。  
  
Awesome. Vivid descriptions (and a bit digusting, but I'm guessing that was the intention), but very heartfelt moments, all perfectly weaved around something as mundane as a heat wave and a broken AC. I really liked it :)  
非常出色。描述生动（甚至有些令人不适，但我想这正是作者的意图），情感真挚，所有这些都巧妙地围绕着热浪和坏掉的空调这类日常琐事展开。我非常喜欢 :)

[skyf0x](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/14765557/skyf0x): I'm impressed by how this story becomes something special as you read it. It happens step by step, but rather quickly, and instantly, you just want to keep reading it. Because it is, it is special and original, at least for me. Despite the absence of genre tags, I think it's a great example of a romantic 'dramedy', even if the story doesn't try to show everything too explicitly. Overall, I really enjoyed it.  
这个故事在阅读过程中逐渐展现出它的特别之处，速度之快令人印象深刻，让人立刻产生继续阅读的欲望。对我而言，它既独特又新颖。虽然缺乏明确的类型标签，但它无疑是一部优秀的浪漫“悲喜剧”，尽管故事并未刻意展现所有细节。整体而言，我非常享受阅读它。  
  
One of the reasons this story easily hooks me in is the main premise. I really understand the situation. Indeed, it's summer, 30 Celsius degrees, I'm sitting in an unbearably hot apartment without air conditioning and reading this. These poor kids, they are just like me, for real. Not to mention the fact that these vivid descriptions and analogies build up a truly realistic picture of what is happening. I always thought this hot summer in NGE would look like that for the characters. Unbearably sweaty. So thank you for the way you've presented it here. It's not something that fics often focus on, but when it's done in a similar way as here, it doesn't look weird, but interestingly specific. It adds some new level of world building that serves as both a background and a global trigger for the narrative at many scenes.  
这个故事之所以能轻易吸引我，其中一个原因是它的主要前提。我真的很理解这种情境。确实，现在是夏天，30 摄氏度，我正坐在一个没有空调、热得让人难以忍受的公寓里读着这个。这些可怜的孩子，他们就像我一样，真的。更不用说这些生动的描述和比喻构建了一个真正真实的画面，展现了正在发生的事情。我一直认为《新世纪福音战士》中那个炎热的夏天对角色来说就是这样的。热得让人汗流浃背。所以，感谢你在这里的呈现方式。这不是同人文经常关注的点，但像这里这样处理时，它看起来并不奇怪，而是有趣且具体。 这一新层次的世界构建在众多场景中既提供了背景，又充当了推动叙事发展的全球性触发因素。  
  
I think the point in the timeline of the original story to tell this AU was perfectly chosen. This is the moment when Asuka's interest in Shinji is at its highest point before everything goes to tatters, and when Shinji's confidence has not yet been shaken too much and he could still push Asuka back. Thus we are presented with a very entertaining mix. Something very similar to their dynamic in episode 9, that classic funny bickering with each other, but now with a touch of more seriousness and drama, with more focus on their relationship and interest in each other. Even if it's not shown explicitly, Asuka's point of view throughout the chapter is an indication that things aren't that simple, and her thoughts are constantly tossing from side to side, giving no rest to her mind, heart or body. It's hard to describe how wonderful it was to see this kind of dynamic between the two of them, it just felt right. And simply, reading their dialogues and actions was a pleasure, I laughed and it was cute. I'd like to focus on details, but I guess I'd have ended up talking about every moment with those two characters together or separately - that's how a lot of good things were here.  
我认为选择在原故事时间线的这个节点来展开这个 AU 非常合适。此时，明日香对真嗣的兴趣正浓，而一切尚未崩坏；同时，真嗣的信心还未被严重动摇，仍有能力回应明日香。因此，我们得以欣赏到一种既有趣又富有深度的混合风格。这类似于他们在第 9 集中那种经典的搞笑斗嘴，但现在增添了更多的严肃性和戏剧性，更加关注他们之间的情感纠葛和相互吸引。 尽管没有明示，但本章中明日香的视角暗示了事情的复杂性，她的思绪不断在左右之间摇摆，使得她的心灵、身体都无法得到片刻安宁。看到他们之间这种动态的互动，感觉非常美妙且恰到好处。简而言之，阅读他们的对话和行动是一种乐趣，我笑了，感觉很可爱。我本想深入细节，但恐怕会不自觉地谈论到他们在一起或单独的每一个瞬间——因为这里确实充满了许多美好时刻。  
  
There is a need to note the technical side of the narrative. It may seem to someone that this approach to storytelling is somewhat chaotic and maybe fundamentally weird a little. But for me, it seemed almost perfect. There is something about the way the constructions are relatively simple, moving us directly from one point in the story to another. Relatively straightforward, while at the same time jumping from thought to thought. But all together, it looked exactly how I like to imagine the characters' scenes together, especially Asuka and Shinji. Little references to moments from the show, little self-references to moments and sentences from the fic, it all lined up in a great way to tell the story. It gave us a sense of high dynamic, that brought the entertainment with such pace. Straight to the point almost in every paragraph, always keeping some meta-meaning in the descriptions of normal things.  
叙事的技术层面值得关注。有人或许会觉得这种讲故事的方式略显混乱，甚至有些怪异，但对我而言，它近乎完美。故事结构相对简单，直接引导我们从一处情节跳跃到另一处，既直接又富有思想跳跃。整体而言，它恰如其分地呈现了我心目中角色间的互动场景，尤其是明日香和真嗣。对原作时刻的巧妙提及，以及对小说内文的小小自我引用，这些元素巧妙结合，共同编织了一个引人入胜的故事。这种高动态的叙事节奏，带来了极佳的娱乐体验。 几乎每个段落都直截了当，在描述日常事物时始终蕴含着深层的含义。  
  
In the end, this story looks like it could end right there, and it would still be a great story in which both we and Asuka realised quite a lot. But on the other hand, the story itself introduced a lot of intriguing ideas and hints that need to be explored more and taken to their logical development and conclusion. And I think this kind of abrupt ending and the lack of "Completed" tag say us that this story, which has already become one of my favourites, will be continued and completed properly. At least I hope I'm not wrong.  
最终，这个故事似乎可以就此画上句号，它依然会是一个我们和明日香都收获良多的精彩故事。然而，故事本身引入了许多引人入胜的想法和线索，需要进一步探索并推向合乎逻辑的发展和结论。我认为这种突如其来的结局和缺乏“已完成”标签暗示着，这个已经跻身我最爱之列的故事将会继续并得到妥善完成。至少我希望我没有错。

[skyf0x](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/14765557/skyf0x): I guess I was wrong with my predictions after the previous chapter. And I'm even kind of disappointed because of this. Well, only my expectations are to blame, because that global shift in point of view and the lack of a simple continuation was not visible on the horizon at all. I suppose naming the chapters as SIDE A and SIDE B sounds very appropriate now, like two different sides of the record. The first one is already over and cannot be continued, and the second one looks like a different story, even if conceptually they are similar because they are in the same "album".  
我意识到我在上一章的预测有误，对此我感到有些失望。不过，这只能怪我自己期望过高，因为之前根本看不出视角的全球性转变和缺乏简单的延续。现在看来，将章节命名为 SIDE A 和 SIDE B 非常恰当，就像唱片的两面。第一面已经结束，无法继续，而第二面则像是一个全新的故事，尽管在概念上它们相似，因为它们同属一张“专辑”。  
  
That's why, conceptually, I wasn't very happy with what I was seeing now. The story itself as a whole instantly hooked by its narrative. And the ending of the first chapter only intensified such feelings, leaving hints of a meaningful continuation of the plot and events. It felt abruptly cut, with the hope of revealing something more, teasing us that something might happen next. What will Asuka and Shinji do next? Will everything remain at the level of half-hints and thoughts, despite how they've already pretty much volunteered to spend time together? It turns out that we won't find out much more than that, we won't even find them here. The emotional subtext built up in the first chapter was to some extent ruined by the fact that there is the next chapter, but the events between the characters have not developed. All we see is the fact that they have returned home. And such an 'ending' for them can spoil the emotions about the first chapter, which works better without the now meaningless mundane details about Asuka and Shinji here.  
因此，从概念上来说，我对当前所见并不十分满意。整个故事的叙述立即吸引了我，而第一章的结尾更是加深了这种感受，留下了对剧情和事件有意义延续的暗示。这种突然的切断感，让人期待揭示更多，挑逗着我们接下来可能发生的事情。明日香和真嗣接下来会采取什么行动？尽管他们已经几乎自愿地决定共度时光，但一切是否仍将停留在半暗示和思考的层面？事实证明，我们不会发现比这更多的内容，甚至在这里也找不到他们。 第一章中精心构建的情感潜台词，在某种程度上因下一章的存在而受损，因为角色间的关系并未进一步发展。我们仅看到他们回到了家。这样的“结局”可能削弱第一章的情感深度，若无现在这些关于明日香和真嗣的无意义日常细节，效果或许更佳。  
  
Does this make the new chapter or the story as a whole worse? Not at all. It's awesome. Now the story is just seen in a different light, and I appreciate the idea. Now when we look at the completed story, the obvious thing that pops up is that it's all like some sort of addition to episode 15. Not a plot extension, but a conceptual one. Something that could really happen in the series between episodes 16 and 17 without turning everything into AU, it's very realistic. We see that implicit-but-obvious comparison between Misato/Kaji and Asuka/Sinji again as in episode 15. We see it not in such a dramatic light, but through the lens of melancholy, which is as easy to sink into as the heat permeates the Katsuragi apartment. Moreover, this fic reinforces the basic idea of comparing these couples.  
这会让新章节或整个故事变得更糟吗？一点也不。这很棒。现在故事只是以不同的视角呈现，我更加欣赏这个想法。现在当我们回顾完整的故事时，显而易见的是，这一切都像是第 15 集的某种补充。不是情节上的延伸，而是概念上的。在第 16 集和第 17 集之间，这系列中确实可能发生的事情，不会让一切变成平行世界，非常真实。我们再次看到了第 15 集中那种隐晦但明显的美里/加持和明日香/真嗣之间的对比。我们没有以如此戏剧化的方式看到它，而是通过忧郁的镜头，就像热量渗透到葛城公寓一样容易沉浸其中。 此外，这篇同人文进一步强化了比较这些情侣的基本理念。  
  
Asuka and Shinji aren't together yet, they can't find the right connection. But they try to do so even if they fight and quarrel along the way, and achieve results in the first chapter, and this is presented in the light of the fact that they have high hopes that everything will work out and nothing is lost. They get closer emotionally, even if physically they're not, even if physically they're still in different rooms by the end of the story.  
尽管明日香和真嗣尚未走到一起，他们仍在寻找那份恰当的联系。尽管一路上的争吵与冲突不断，他们在第一章中取得了进展，这源于他们对一切终将好转的深切期望。他们在情感上愈发亲近，尽管身体上仍未相拥，甚至在故事结尾时还分处不同的房间。  
  
This chapter focusing on Misato shows that her relationship with Kaji is "restored", it doesn't consist of fighting. On the contrary, they are close and the narrative shows several times how much. But at the same time it is only physical intimacy, while the emotional one is mired in doubts, fears and insecurities. Constant questions about who they are now and whether they can rekindle all feelings in a normal way again. Even though they are already different people and have lost (continue to lose) their chance to be truly close, the story tries to present this aspect in a much more hopeful light as well. And this only adds more melancholy and bittersweetness, because both the reader and the characters understand all about the potential tragedy of their journey in the future.  
本章着重描绘美里与加持的关系，显示他们已“重归于好”，不再有争执。相反，两人关系紧密，文中多次强调这一点。然而，这种亲密仅限于肉体层面，情感上却充满疑虑、恐惧和不安全感。他们不断自问现在的身份以及是否能以正常方式重新点燃所有情感。尽管他们已是不同的人，失去了（继续失去）真正亲近的机会，故事仍试图以更充满希望的光芒呈现这一方面。而这只会增添更多的忧郁和苦乐参半，因为读者和角色都明白他们未来旅程中潜在的悲剧。  
  
But for now, it doesn't matter at all. After all, Shinji and Asuka are finally home, with Misato. They are not her children and never will be, just as she and Kaji will never be the same again as they were before. But maybe this time it's okay to dream a little. Maybe it's okay to try to make that dream come true. But that won't be until tomorrow. Or the day after the tomorrow. Or the day after that. Not now.  
然而此刻，这一切都已无关紧要。毕竟，真嗣和明日香终于回到了美里身边。他们虽非她的亲生子女，也永远不会成为那样，正如她和加持再也无法回到过去的模样。但或许这次，允许自己稍稍梦想一下也无妨。或许可以尝试让那个梦想成真。但这不会是今天，也不会是明天，甚至不是后天的明天。不是现在。  
  
There is no proper ending for asushin, so - bad! Even anticlimactic in some way. But, seriously speaking, it was beautiful as a whole. Narration served story's intentions, I believe, and the intention was a good delve in this certain mood, exploring it naturally, without going overboard, still being true to the original, yet trying to bring more satisfaction in a new way. I loved this despite wanting to love something a little bit different. And I think it's great as it is. We need more such fics.  
对于 asushin 而言，结局并不完美，甚至略显突兀。然而，从整体来看，它依然美丽动人。叙述紧扣故事主旨，旨在细腻地挖掘特定情感，既不过分渲染，也忠实于原作精神，同时尝试以新颖方式增添满足感。尽管我期望看到一些不同的变化，但我依然喜爱这部作品。它的呈现已经相当出色，我们期待更多此类佳作的出现。

[Lebeauf](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/15341810/Lebeauf): I liked how, in the end, melancholic this story is. It was already present in the first chapter, but was more pronounced in this one. It fits the setting well, post-ep15, where in the OG series things have started to slowly go downhill and are already at a point where it's hard to turn the tide back. And it also fits that such melancholy is more palpable in the second chapter because as this adult couple says, our idiot kids don't even know what they're having. And missing.  我喜欢这个故事最终流露出的忧郁氛围。这种情绪在第一章就有所体现，而在这一章中更为突出。它恰如其分地映衬了背景，即原系列中，剧情在第 15 集后逐渐走向低谷，已经到了难以挽回的地步。同时，正如这对成年夫妇所言，我们的孩子们尚未意识到他们所拥有的和所失去的，这种忧郁在第二章中更加明显，也显得合情合理。  
  
But I also liked how the story doesn't really wallow in this melancholy. It utilizes an appropriate amount of humor very well. It's genuinely funny, not feeling forced at all, and while it works as a balancing tool for the quality of the story itself, it's also only appropriate as a fanfiction of Evangelion to mix in silly elements to itself. One of the crucial parts that made the OG story special, something many fic writers seems to forget.  
我也很欣赏这个故事没有过分沉溺于忧郁情绪，而是巧妙地融入了适量的幽默元素。这种幽默自然而不造作，不仅平衡了故事的整体质感，也恰如其分地体现了作为《新世纪福音战士》同人作品的特质，即适度地加入一些轻松诙谐的元素。这一点正是原作故事独特魅力的关键所在，遗憾的是，许多同人作者似乎并未意识到其重要性。  
  
And of course, I liked the writings very much. It's vivid. Never gets too wordy, while still rich enough. As someone who constantly struggles with words and sentences of this foreign language I envy your skill.  
当然，我非常喜欢这些作品。它们生动形象，既不过于冗长，又足够丰富。作为一个经常与这门外语的词汇和句子作斗争的人，我羡慕你的技巧。  
  
The culture of this fandom, from what I've seen, seems to prefer mundane and rambling longfics more than well-written short stories or one-shots. This kind of story deserves more acknowledgment and fav numbers than some-random-OC-kid-Iseakai'd-to-Eva-world kind of uninteresting shits, in my honest opinion.  
据我观察，这个粉丝群体似乎更偏爱那些平淡而冗长的长篇小说，而非精巧的短篇故事或一次性完结的作品。在我看来，这类故事应当获得更多的认可和收藏，而不是那些毫无新意的、穿越到 EVA 世界的 OC 小孩故事。

**Bubbles**: The story feels strangely poignant. I don't know why. Liked it  
这个故事给人一种奇怪的凄美感。我不知道为什么。我很喜欢它。

[Lebeauf](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/15341810/Lebeauf): I liked the vivid descriptions throughout the fic. Probably the strongest part of the story. I have a personal experience of an average Japanese summer and boy the heat and humidity are not survivable. I always imagined the Katsuragi household of eternal summer as a sticky, stuffy place with a distinct stink of its inhabitants that's ever-existent like an undercurrent. Drunkard and a penguin and two teenagers, all sharing the same place. Such a place could never smell good even under more pleasant weather. One could probably nitpick how we don't have an evidence of air-conditioner in Misato's apartment but that would be unnecessary in the whole scheme.  
我特别喜欢文中那些生动的描写，这无疑是故事中最精彩的部分。我曾亲身体验过日本普通的夏天，那种湿热真的让人难以忍受。我总是想象葛城家就像一个永恒的夏天，一个黏腻、闷热的地方，有着居民特有的臭味，像暗流一样永远存在。醉汉、一只企鹅和两个青少年，都住在同一个地方。即使在更宜人的天气里，这样的地方也不可能闻起来好。人们可能会挑剔我们没有证据表明美里公寓里有空调，但这在整个故事中并不重要。
  
I see this story is not marked as complete, unlike your previous one. Would we have a follow-up? Or not? The final parts of the story feel it could be either way.  
我看到这个故事没有标记为完整，不像你之前的故事。请问是否会有续集？故事的结尾部分让人感觉似乎两种可能性都存在。

[MagicalMetallurgy](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/15398765/MagicalMetallurgy): Is the foreground of a post-Second Impact heatwave meant to emphasize the sexual tension Asuka feels for having to share a living with Shinji? Because that's really clever, I really like that idea!  
二冲击后的热浪背景是否旨在突出明日香与真嗣同住时所感受到的性紧张？这种设计确实巧妙，我对此想法颇为欣赏。  
  
I enjoyed both your Eva fics and how you wrote feelings and sensations in this really intimate and immersive way.  
我非常欣赏你的 Eva 同人文，特别是你以一种极其亲密和沉浸的方式来描绘情感和感官体验。
