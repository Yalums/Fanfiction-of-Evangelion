What you are about to read is in no way connected to my previous Fan-Fiction, "In the Case of Asuka Langley Sohryu," which I still recommend you read because, in my opinion, I think it touches upon a certain aspect of the series that people usually don't touch upon: why don't these damn kids just get psychologists to help them with their problems? Well, that not withstanding, I've wanted to find fan-fics where Asuka and Shinji finally confront the horrors of parenthood, and considering just what their parents were like, one having a rather cold and distant father and the other's mother committing suicide in front of her eyes, it left much potential not only to do a great Asuka fan-fic, but also a great Shinji fan-fic as well. Naturally, considering the subject matter, there will be several OCs, but they'll mostly be children.  
你即将阅读的内容与我之前的同人小说《浅谈惣流·明日香·兰格雷的个案》并无任何关联，我仍推荐你阅读，因为在我看来，它触及了该系列中人们通常不涉及的一个方面：这些孩子为何不寻求心理学家帮助解决他们的问题？尽管如此，我一直想找到关于明日香和真嗣最终直面育儿恐怖的同人作品，考虑到他们的父母分别是怎样的人——一个有着冷漠疏离的父亲，另一个的母亲则在眼前自杀，这不仅为创作一部优秀的明日香同人提供了广阔空间，也为真嗣同人开辟了同样广阔的可能性。当然，鉴于主题，会有一些原创角色，但大部分会是孩子。

WARNING: Despite being rated T, there is a very mild, PG-13 level sex scene in the next chapter. This is not a lemon, not a hentai, and the sex will barely count as ecchi. It's more essentially to show the beauty of the human body, and just how two certain characters get into this situation in the first place. If you feel uncomfortable about it, gloss over it. If you're into that sort of stuff, like lemons, I'm sorry, but I want this to reach the general audience.  
警告：尽管评级为 T，下一章中包含一个非常温和的 PG-13 级别性爱场景。这不是柠檬文，不是 hentai，性爱内容几乎算不上是 ecchi。其主要目的是展现人体之美，以及两位特定角色是如何陷入这种情境的。如果你对此感到不适，可以选择略过。如果你喜欢柠檬文这类内容，很抱歉，但我希望这部作品能面向更广泛的读者。

So, without further adieu…  
那么，不再多说……

### **THE LITTLE ANGEL 小天使**

**BY DA GAMES ELITE 由游戏精英创作**

**Part 1 第一部分**

"I mustn't run away, I mustn't run away, I mustn't—"  
“我绝不能逃跑，我绝不能逃跑，我绝不能——”

"Shut up, please." 请闭嘴。

"Sorry." "对不起。"

Usually those were lines spoken by her, telling him to shut up, that he was being annoying, that this stupid habit of his, that fallback on muttering that same mantra to calm his nerves was just immature, irritating, and, once again, stupid. However, for better or worse, the adult known as Shinji Ikari glanced over at the tense individual sitting next to him, a man he had known for over ten years, through the tough times and the bad, a man who was now in both an enviable situation and a pitiful one: Toji Suzuhara.  
通常这些话都是她对他说的，让他闭嘴，说他烦人，他这个愚蠢的习惯，总是用那句咒语来平复自己的紧张情绪，既幼稚又恼人，而且，又一次，愚蠢。然而，不管是好是坏，成年人真嗣一瞥向坐在他旁边紧张兮兮的那个人，一个他认识超过十年的人，经历了艰难和糟糕的时光，一个现在处于令人羡慕和可怜境地的人：铃原东治。

Years ago, Shinji had watched Toji being ripped apart before his eyes. Well, his Eva being ripped apart, anyway, by Shinji's own Unit-01. That had been almost another life time ago. If you saw Toji know, while you wouldn't think he was in the best of health considering the circumstances, he certainly didn't look like a dismembered devastated wreck. His arms had been replaced with metallic, robotic ones. In the early years following Third Impact, they had looked cartoonish, like something out of a sci-fi film. Just plain metal, unhidden, with long wires and bolts clear to the naked eye. Now, however, thanks to the leaps and bounds of technology, and just the leaps and bounds the world had gone through since Third Impact overall, Toji's mechanical arms, while they occasionally made a buzzing sound every so often due to maybe a loose bolt or a tangled up wire, looked like ordinary appendages, skin, muscle fiber, everything.  
多年前，真嗣曾亲眼目睹了 Toji 被撕裂的场景。确切地说，是他的 Eva 被真嗣自己的初号机撕裂。那仿佛是另一个时代的事了。如今若见到 Toji，尽管考虑到他的经历，你不会认为他身体状况良好，但他绝不像一个肢体残缺、精神崩溃的人。他的双臂已被金属机械臂所替代。在第三次冲击后的最初几年，这些机械臂看起来颇为滑稽，像是科幻电影中的道具，裸露的金属材质，长长的电线和螺栓清晰可见。然而，随着科技的飞速进步，以及第三次冲击后世界整体的巨大变迁，Toji 的机械臂如今已与常人无异，偶尔因松动的螺栓或缠绕的电线发出轻微的嗡鸣声，但其外观已完全模拟了皮肤、肌肉纤维等人体组织。

However, like Shinji said, none of this kept Toji from looking like a broken down wreck right now. Sweat was billowing down his forehead; his hair was in the air because of him ruffling it, tugging at it, anxiously twisting in spite of himself. His eyes were bloodshot, probably because he hadn't had a good night's sleep in the last few days, once again due to circumstance. This lack of sleep also contributed to the black bags he wore under his eyes, the bags that sacked down, and made him look as though he were twenty years older than what he really was: a man at the age of 26.  
然而，正如真嗣所说，这一切都没能让东治看起来不像个支离破碎的废人。汗水正从他的额头滚滚而下；他的头发因为不断抓挠、拉扯，焦虑地扭动而竖立着。他的眼睛布满血丝，很可能是因为他已经好几天没能好好睡上一觉了，这又是环境所迫。这种睡眠不足也导致了他的眼下挂着黑眼圈，那些眼袋下垂，让他看起来仿佛比实际年龄大了二十岁：一个 26 岁的男人。

He looked, for all intents and purposes, like a damn zombie!  
从各方面来看，他简直就像个该死的僵尸！

And Shinji could do nothing about it.  
而真嗣对此无能为力。

"Hey," Shinji mumbled, anxiously wriggling his fingers as he glanced over at Toji, "Do you want me to get you a drink or something? You look like you could use—"  
"嘿，" 真嗣咕哝着，焦虑地扭动着手指，同时瞥向东治，"你要不要我给你拿点喝的？你看起来好像需要——"

"I'm fine, thanks," Toji replied, staring up at the door he had been staring at, waiting in front of, for the last several hours.  
"我没事，谢谢，" 东治回答道，抬头盯着他已经盯着、等待了几个小时的门。

"Are you sure? Listen, she'll be fine, just—"  
"你确定吗？听着，她会没事的，只是——"

"Get yourself a drink. You could use it," Toji replied, glancing over at his friend for a moment.  
“去给自己弄点喝的吧，你正需要这个。” 冬二回答道，目光短暂地瞥向他的朋友。

This was true. In spite of himself, Shinji too looked exhausted. Extremely so.  
这话不假。尽管自己不愿承认，真嗣也显得疲惫不堪。极其疲惫。

Shinji walked down the hospital ward, away from the bench where Toji and their other long time friend Kensuke sat. As he rose, Shinji noticed that Kensuke was actually sound asleep, leaning against the white, cold wall of the hospital hallway. No doubt his job as a military tactician had long hours and lots of stress, so Shinji thought, out of the three of them, HE'D be the one awake, the most calm. But no, he was currently comatose, asleep against the wall, drooling a little bit. His thick brown hair was pressed between his skull and the wall, his usually pasty skin wasn't any more or less pasty than it usually was, his small, slim frame didn't look nearly as exhausted as Toji's large, muscular frame did.  
真嗣沿着医院病房走去，远离了冬二和他们的另一位老朋友健介所坐的长椅。当他起身时，真嗣注意到健介实际上正熟睡着，靠在医院走廊那冰冷的白墙上。毫无疑问，作为军事战术家的工作时长和压力都很大，所以真嗣原以为，在他们三人中，健介会是那个保持清醒、最为镇定的人。但事实并非如此，他此刻正昏昏沉沉地靠在墙上，嘴角还流着口水。他浓密的棕发被压在头骨和墙壁之间，他那通常苍白的皮肤并没有比平时更苍白或更不苍白，他那瘦小的身躯看起来远没有冬二那魁梧的身躯那般疲惫。

"I'll be right back. I just need to use the bathroom a little bit," Shinji replied.  
"我马上回来。只是需要稍微去一下洗手间，" 真嗣回答道。

"Take your time. I'm sure nothing will happen for at least another half-hour," Toji replied, in that tense, strained voice of his.  
"慢慢来。我敢肯定至少还有半小时不会发生什么事，" 东治回答道，声音紧张而勉强。

It bothered Shinji just to see his friend this upset. He'd known him for years, he reflected as he walked down the hallway to whatever destination he intended at arriving at. He'd known him before and after the nightmare known as Third Impact, just like he'd known Kensuke, Hikari, and—  
看到朋友如此心烦意乱，真嗣感到不安。他回想起他们多年的友情，以及在被称为第三次冲击的噩梦前后的点点滴滴，就像他认识剑介、光和——

Where was she, anyway? Where was that German girl? Didn't she realize what her friend was going through right now? What was Shinji saying? Of course she did. She had been the one who had called him last night to tell him to move his ass and arrive at the hospital ASAP. Of course, she had been far harsher with that spitfire tongue of hers, but, in all honesty, Shinji could tell she was worried, concerned, maybe even a little afraid for her friend. This was supposed to be one of the best moments of Toji's life, of Hikari's life, and yet it was proving to be one of the longest, most drawn out periods of stress Shinji had experienced in the last five or six years.  
她到底在哪里？那个德国女孩呢？她难道不知道她朋友现在正经历着什么吗？真嗣在说什么？当然，她肯定知道。昨晚就是她打电话给他，让他赶紧动身，尽快赶到医院。当然，她那火爆的舌头说得更严厉，但说实话，真嗣能感觉到她的担忧，关心，或许还有点为她朋友担心。这本应是剑介一生中最美好的时刻，也是光一生中最美好的时刻，然而现在却成了真嗣过去五六年里经历的最漫长、最紧张的时刻之一。

Nothing next to the pain he felt during that nightmarish day, though.  
尽管如此，没有什么能比得上那个噩梦般的日子里他所感受到的痛苦。

Nothing like the Hell that was Third Impact.  
没有什么能比得上第三次冲击的地狱。

He had to stop reflecting on that day! Third Impact had occurred over a decade ago! It was over, finished! It was a nightmare he was never going to need to relive again, those first three years of utter chaos, the first seven months where he and Asuka remained alone, struggling to survive, wondering if anyone would ever return, the next year seeing civilization struggle to return to normalcy, and, for the rest of the immediate aftermath of Third Impact, watch the nation crumble apart before the remnants of NERV decided to put things in order. The horrors of finding people's starving bodies on the ground in heaps, of seeing people slaughtered in genocide, of being held a prisoner in questioning booths and concentration camps, it was all in the past! All in the damn past!  
他不得不停止回想那一天！第三次冲击已经过去十多年了！一切都结束了，完结了！那是一场他再也不需要重温的噩梦，最初的三年完全混乱，前七个月他和明日香孤立无援，挣扎求生，不知道是否还会有人回来，接下来的一年里，文明努力恢复正常，而在第三次冲击的余波中，眼看着国家分崩离析，直到 NERV 的残余力量决定恢复秩序。那些在街头发现成堆饿死的人们，目睹种族灭绝中的屠杀，被囚禁在审讯亭和集中营里的恐怖经历，都已成为过去！全都他妈的过去了！

Finding himself in front of a sink in the blue-tiled bathroom of this hospital, Shinji threw water against his face, rubbing it clean as he realized the absurdity of what he was saying. All in the past? That was just stupid, as Asuka would always say! He knew that those events had affected him on a deeper level, yes, and that he could never change them. The world he lived in now was drastically affected by those days. All he could do now was hope for a better tomorrow, and, with all that had been going on in the last few years, things had been better.  
发现自己站在医院蓝色瓷砖的洗手间前，真嗣将水泼向脸庞，揉搓着洗净，同时意识到自己所说的话有多荒谬。一切都过去了？那真是愚蠢，就像明日香常说的那样！他知道那些事件在他内心深处留下了影响，是的，他永远无法改变它们。他现在生活的世界深受那些日子的影响。他现在能做的就是期待一个更好的明天，而且，在过去的几年里，事情确实有所好转。

As Shinji left the bathroom, he heard a voice crack as it shouted his name. He glanced over his shoulder, only to see a pair of arms wrap themselves around his face, smothering him in a pair of thick breasts, strangling him, choking the life out of him. He turned blue in a matter of moments, barely able to pull away from that restrictive bear hug only to find, to his utter astonishment, fused of course with utter delight, Misato Katsuragi—er—Misato Hyuga, a woman who had been more a mother to him than even the woman named Yui Ikari, who now was somewhere in the depths of space, perhaps gone forever from Shinji's life.  
当真嗣离开洗手间时，他听到一个声音嘶哑地喊着他的名字。他回头一看，只见一双胳膊紧紧地抱住他的脸，用一对丰满的胸部将他闷住，勒得他喘不过气来。他很快就脸色发青，几乎无法挣脱那个束缚的熊抱，结果却发现，当然也带着无比的惊喜，是美里·卡苏拉吉——呃——美里·日向，这个女人对他来说比名为唯·碇的女人更像母亲，而唯·碇现在可能在太空深处，也许永远离开了真嗣的生活。

Shinji didn't like thinking about that. After all, here was Misato! Don't think about the past, the present! Here! Now! Misato!  
真嗣不喜欢去想那些事。毕竟，眼前是美里啊！别去想过去，别去想现在！就在这里！就在此刻！美里！

Somehow, this didn't cheer him up much at all.  
不知为何，这丝毫没有让他感到振奋。

"Oh, Shinji! I've missed you so—hey, what's wrong?" Misato asked, finally drawing back from her heart-felt, and in Shinji's case boob felt, greeting, only to notice that the recipient of the hug, or perhaps victim would be the better term, wasn't nearly as happy as she was. "Are you stressed about Hikari? Don't be. She'll be fine. It'll all turn out for the best in the end, so don't worry about a thing."  
“哦，真嗣！我好想你——嘿，怎么了？”美里终于从她那发自内心的，对真嗣来说则是胸部感受的问候中退开，这才注意到拥抱的接受者，或许用受害者更恰当，并没有像她那样开心。“你是在担心光吗？别担心。她会没事的。一切最终都会好起来的，所以别担心。”

Shinji, in his flashback, had almost forgotten about the reason he was in this damn, ice cold hospital in the first place. Shaking the cobwebs out of his head, he replied, in a strained voice, "Oh, I'm fine, don't worry."  
在回忆中，真嗣几乎忘记了最初自己为何会在这该死的、冰冷的医院里。他摇摇头驱散思绪，用略显沙哑的声音回答：“哦，我没事，别担心。”

Misato glanced at him critically, and, for the first time in awhile, Shinji had a good look at the woman who had helped raise him before and after—don't think of it, don't think of it, don't think of it! Well, avoiding that thing that would cause him to regress once again into a painful reflection, Misato had aged slightly. Her face had developed slight laugh lines in the ten years past—Damn it! Don't think that way!—that day. Her hair had even developed one or two gray hairs that she seemed to have forgotten, conveniently enough, to dye. Additionally, it looked like her drinking had caught up to her in some degree, as her body now looked slightly puffier than it had last, as though a thin deposit of fat had grown all over her body. Still, to the ordinary person who hadn't known Misato in her heyday, she was quite a knock-out, especially for an older woman.  
美里用审视的目光看了他一眼，而真嗣也难得有机会仔细打量这位在他成长过程中一直照顾他的女性——别想了，别想了，别想了！好吧，避开那个会让他再次陷入痛苦回忆的念头，美里确实有些变化。她的脸上多了几道笑纹，那是过去十年间留下的痕迹——该死！别这么想！那天之后。她的头发里也冒出了一两根白发，她似乎忘了染发。此外，她的饮酒习惯似乎也开始显现影响，身体看起来比上次见面时略显臃肿，仿佛全身都长了一层薄薄的脂肪。不过，对于那些不熟悉美里年轻时风采的普通人来说，她依然是个美人，尤其是对于一位年长的女性而言。

Shinji never thought he'd call Misato an older woman, ever.  
真嗣从未想过自己会称美里为年长的女性。

"You know, Shinji, when you say 'I'm fine' that just screams out how damn upset you really are, but I'll let that one slide," Misato replied, a small grin on her lips, "Look, I know how you must feel. I mean, Makoto went through the same thing with me when I had Yumi." Misato rested a hand absentmindedly on her torso, as though she could still feel the fetus kicking inside of her. "And he went through the same thing with Ryouji." She added, on a gentler note.  
"你知道吗，真嗣，当你说‘我没事’的时候，那简直就是在尖叫你有多么难过，不过这次我就放过你吧，"美里回答道，嘴角带着一丝微笑，"听着，我知道你现在的感受。我是说，诚在优米出生时也经历了同样的事情。"美里不经意地把手放在腹部，仿佛还能感觉到胎儿在里面踢动。"他和谅司也经历了同样的事情。"她补充道，语气更加温柔。

"Uh, where are your children, anyway? Are they with Makoto?"  
"呃，你的孩子们呢？他们和诚在一起吗？"

"Yeah, I mean, he wanted to come, believe me, but someone needed to watch the kids, and he knew I would probably be better emotional support for you guys, so he sent me." Misato added a little laugh at the end, as though to assure Shinji she was fine and happy that she was arriving to this event alone, but Shinji knew differently.  
"是的，我是说，他本来也想来，相信我，但总得有人照顾孩子，而且他知道我可能会是你们更好的情感支持，所以他让我来了。"美里在结尾处加了一点笑声，似乎是为了向真嗣保证她很好，很高兴独自来参加这个活动，但真嗣知道事实并非如此。

Still, he didn't bring it up.  
然而，他并未提及此事。

"So, uh, do you want to come back with us? We're just sitting there, waiting."  
"那么，呃，你想跟我们回去吗？我们只是坐在那里，等着。"

"Okay, that's fine," Misato replied, nodding as the two of them went off to the hospital ward where Toji and Kensuke were. As they walked together, Misato glanced around the hospital, in mild awe, as though the cold interior of this place were something out of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. After a few minutes of glancing around at the occasional hanging picture of a flower or of a random historical figure who had done something special in the field of medicine, she asked, "Is this the hospital that Maya's in charge of?"  
"好的，没关系，" 美里回答道，点头示意两人前往医院病房，那里有真治和健介。他们并肩而行，美里环顾医院四周，带着些许敬畏，仿佛这冰冷的内部环境是出自威利旺卡巧克力工厂的奇景。几分钟后，她不时瞥向偶尔悬挂的花卉画或某位在医学领域有特殊贡献的历史人物肖像，问道："这是玛雅负责的医院吗？"

"Huh? Oh, yeah, she does."  
"嗯？哦，对，她是这样。"

"Oh, that's nice." "哦，那挺好的。"

"Yeah, it is." "是啊，确实不错。"

An awkward silence filled the time period following this statement. For a moment, the two individuals simply walked down the hallway, until Shinji asked, curiously, "Does Makoto have any news on whether—"  
这句话之后，一阵尴尬的沉默弥漫开来。有那么一会儿，两人只是默默地走在走廊上，直到真嗣好奇地问道：“真琴有没有关于是否——的消息？”

"We don't know where Ritsuko is yet," Misato replied, frowning slightly. She glanced over at her side, at the ground by her feet. "And we haven't found—haven't found—"  
“我们还不知道律子在哪里，”美里回答，微微皱眉。她瞥了一眼身旁，目光落在脚边的地面上。“而且我们还没找到——还没找到——”

"Uh, Misato, we're here," Shinji said, gesturing toward Toji as he remained huddled on a bench, with Kensuke slowly rousing himself from slumber land. Rubbing the sleep from his eyes, Kensuke Aida glanced up, noticing Misato for the first time.  
“呃，美里，我们到了，”真嗣说着，指向仍然蜷缩在长椅上的冬二，以及正慢慢从睡梦中醒来的健介。揉着惺忪的睡眼，相田健介抬起头，第一次注意到美里。

"Misato! Good morning!" Kensuke stammered, rising to his feet and bowing slightly.  
“美里！早上好！” 真嗣结结巴巴地说着，站起身来微微鞠了一躬。

"Kensuke, we're not working right now. You don't need to bow or salute every time I—"  
“真嗣，我们现在不在工作。你不需要每次见到我都鞠躬或敬礼——”

"Just habit, sorry," Kensuke replied, sitting down next to Toji, who now glanced up at Misato, curiously.  
“只是习惯，抱歉，” 真嗣回答道，坐到了冬二旁边，冬二此时好奇地抬头看向美里。

"Oh, hey," he replied in an uncharacteristic tone of bland disinterest.  
"哦，嘿，" 他用一种不寻常的平淡无趣的语气回答道。

"Stressed out, huh?" Misato asked, curiously.  
"压力山大，是吧？" 美里好奇地问道。

"Yeah, I guess you can say that," Toji replied, "Hey, Misato?"  
"嗯，我想你可以这么说，" 冬二回答，"嘿，美里？"

"Yeah?" "嗯？"

"When it happens, you know, does it hurt?"  
"当它发生时，你知道，会痛吗？"

"Oh, uh, well, about that." Misato blushed deep red as she struggled, no doubt, for a delicate, perhaps productive way to tell Toji that the answer to his question was yes, it was excruciating, painful, unbearable, hurt so damn much she'd rather have a battle axe slammed through her torso. "Well, it's not TOO painful. I mean, they put you on medication and anti-pain pills and—"  
"哦，呃，关于那个。" 美里脸红得深红，她挣扎着，毫无疑问，是在寻找一种既委婉又可能有效的方式告诉真治，他的问题的答案是肯定的，那是极其痛苦、难以忍受的，痛得她宁愿被战斧劈穿胸膛。"嗯，不是特别痛。我是说，他们会给你用药和止痛药片之类的——"

The sound of agonized screams filled the air from behind the door.  
门后传来痛苦的尖叫声，空气中弥漫着绝望的气息。

Misato fell silent. 美里沉默了。

"Thanks for at least trying," Toji replied, glumly.  
“至少你尝试过了，”冬二沮丧地回答。

It was at that moment that a doctor departed through those doors, and Toji, the anxious man that he is, jumped up, a tense expression on his face, the expression on his face akin to a sinner seeing God, praying for merciful judgment upon him. He lumbered forward, anxiously, as he spoke, slowly, "Is she—is she—is she alright?"  
"就在那一刻，一位医生从那扇门走了出来，而焦虑不安的冬二立刻跳了起来，脸上带着紧张的表情，那神情宛如一个罪人见到上帝，祈求仁慈的审判降临于他。他蹒跚向前，焦虑地，缓缓地问道：“她——她——她还好吗？””

The doctor, a pleasant looking man probably in his thirties, smiled, and nodded. "Your wife is in pristine condition. The delivery went off splendidly. It's a boy."  
"医生，一个看起来和蔼可亲、大约三十多岁的男子，微笑着点了点头。“您的妻子状况极佳。分娩非常顺利。是个男孩。””

"A boy?" Toji began to giggle to himself, like a giddy school girl, a laugh that grew louder and louder until he fell to his knees, almost in tears as a broad smile spread across his face. Shinji didn't know what to do. He did the thing he supposed was proper for a moment like that: he approached his friend, and patted his back reassuringly. Toji glanced over his shoulder, a smile on his face. "A boy. Can you believe it? a boy."  
"“男孩？”冬二开始自顾自地咯咯笑起来，像个兴奋的小女生，笑声越来越响亮，直到他跪倒在地，几乎要哭出来，脸上绽放出灿烂的笑容。真嗣不知道该做什么。他想在这种时刻应该做的是：他走向朋友，安慰地拍了拍他的背。冬二回头看了一眼，脸上带着笑容。“一个男孩。你能相信吗？一个男孩。””

"I know," Shinji replied, not sure what to say in a time like this. When it had been Makoto, this situation hadn't been nearly as difficult because he had composed himself pretty well, taking everything in stride.  
"我知道，" 真嗣回答道，不确定在这种时候该说些什么。当那是诚的时候，这种情况还没有这么困难，因为他很好地控制了自己，从容应对一切。

"If you want to see your wife, we can let you in, but just be careful: she's exhausted. She's been in labor for quite some time. It's a good thing her friend was with us."  
"如果你想见你的妻子，我们可以让你进去，但请小心：她非常疲惫。她已经分娩了相当长的时间。还好她的朋友和我们在一起。"

"Friend?" Shinji asked, a little confused.  
"朋友？" 真嗣有些困惑地问道。

A second individual existed the double doors to the ward. It was strange: Shinji had asked himself why Asuka was nowhere to be found, but not for a second did he realize, in the event of her friend going through one of the greatest and most painful events in her life, that she'd be in the ward with her friend, helping her own, encouraging her to push, to go on harder, to live. Her long scarlet hair ran down her back, if anything more beautiful than she had been when he first met her. Right now, however, she was just as sweaty as Shinji was, maybe even more so. Her yellow sundress was sticking to her skin, her long crimson hair sticking to her forehead, her baby-blue eyes filled with an exhausted joy, a muted euphoria, a weary happiness.  
另一人从病房的双开门中走了出来。这很奇怪：真嗣曾自问为何找不到明日香，但他从未意识到，在她朋友经历一生中最重大、最痛苦的时刻时，她会在病房里陪伴朋友，帮助她，鼓励她用力、坚持、活下去。她那长长的绯红发丝垂在背后，比初见时更加美丽。然而此刻，她和真嗣一样满身汗水，甚至可能更多。她的黄色太阳裙紧贴着肌肤，长长的深红发丝粘在额头上，那双婴儿蓝的眼睛里充满了疲惫的喜悦，一种沉静的兴奋，一种疲倦的幸福。

"Normally I'd be upset that the Devil was with my wife, but I'll make an exception for today," Toji replied, jumping up and, to Shinji's disbelief, hugging the girl. Shinji thought, at first, that Asuka might be so tired she wouldn't react with that ordinary spitfire tongue of hers, that energy, that bratty streak that hadn't died in the years since her adolescence.  
“通常我会对恶魔和我妻子在一起感到不爽，但今天我破例了，” 阿薰回答道，跳起来，让真嗣难以置信的是，他拥抱了那个女孩。真嗣起初以为，明日香可能太累了，不会像往常那样用她那火爆的舌头回应，那种活力，那种青春期后未曾消逝的顽皮。

She wasn't. 她确实没有。

As Asuka shoved Toji to the floor, she snapped, in a high, strained voice, "Mein Gott! Idiot! Arschloch! Schwein! Ugh!"  
当明日香将真嗣推倒在地时，她用尖锐而紧绷的声音喊道：“我的天啊！白痴！混蛋！猪！呸！”

"What the hell!?" Toji stammered, pushing himself to his feet, stunned, yet frustrated and furious.  
“搞什么鬼！？”真嗣结巴着，挣扎起身，既震惊又沮丧和愤怒。

"Don't hug me! Men are just so stupid!" snapped Asuka, "Hugging people who're just standing there. I did this for Hikari, not you."  
“别抱我！男人就是蠢！”明日香厉声道，“抱那些只是站在那里的人。我这么做是为了光，不是为了你。”

"You just had to ruin a perfectly good moment," Toji stammered, frustrated.  
“你就非得毁了一个完美的好时刻吗？”冬二结结巴巴地说，显得很沮丧。

"Oh, ruin a perfectly good moment? Yeah, right! You think you're stressed out? Imagine how I feel? I had to watch my friend in all that pain! Do you know how much it hurts to give birth? It sucks! You men have no right to just say that you suffered because you had to sit around waiting for us!"  
“哦，毁了一个完美的好时刻？得了吧！你以为你压力大？想象一下我的感受吧？我得看着我的朋友经历那种痛苦！你知道生孩子有多疼吗？太糟糕了！你们男人没资格只因为坐着等我们就说自己受苦了！”

Toji glanced out from the corner of his eyes at Misato, an irate expression on his face. "Nice pain-pills?"  
冬二用眼角瞥了一眼美里，脸上带着恼怒的表情。“止痛药不错？”

"Well, they worked when I was—"  
"嗯，它们在我——"

"Gott in Himmel," sighed Asuka, shaking her head, "If you want to hug someone, hug Hikari. She's in that room, and she sent me out to tell you she wants to see you." Toji glanced down at her, a surprised expression on his face. With a slim smile on her face, she added, "She loves you, you know. A lot. Congratulations." Toji stared at her, still surprised that a demon who had just shoved her to the ground could possibly compliment him immediately after insulting him. Still, the eagerness to see to her wife overrode her curiosity, and he darted past the doctor into the ward.  
"天哪，" 明日香叹了口气，摇着头说，"如果你想抱谁，抱光吧。她在那个房间里，让我出来告诉你她想见你。" 总司低头看着她，脸上露出惊讶的表情。她微微一笑，补充道："她爱你，你知道的。很深。恭喜你。" 总司盯着她，仍然惊讶于一个刚刚把她推倒在地的人居然能在侮辱他之后立刻称赞他。尽管如此，急于见到妻子的渴望压倒了她对这一切的好奇，他匆匆从医生身边跑进了病房。

Asuka sighed, her strong aura of bitchiness deflating as she collapsed on the bench where Toji himself had been sitting. Shinji approached her, surprised to see that Asuka's chest, visible in the sweaty dress, was pulsating dangerously, her heart thumping so hard against her ribs it was visible from a distance. Shinji knew this stress wasn't from Toji hugging her.  
明日香叹了口气，她那股强烈的泼辣气息随着她瘫坐在总司刚才坐过的长椅上而消散。真嗣走近她，惊讶地发现明日香那件汗湿的连衣裙下，胸部剧烈地起伏着，心脏猛烈地撞击着肋骨，从远处都能看得一清二楚。真嗣知道这种紧张不是因为总司拥抱了她。

"Uh, Asuka?" Shinji asked, still too nervous to actually take a seat next to her. What if she lashed out at him?  
“呃，明日香？”真嗣问道，仍然紧张得不敢真正坐到她旁边。万一她对他发火怎么办？

"Hey," Asuka replied, her tone wispy, exhausted, but a small smile spreading up her lips. And exhausted smile, "Sit down, please. You're making me tired just looking at you."  
“嘿，”明日香回答，语气微弱、疲惫，但嘴角还是泛起了一丝微笑。一个疲惫的微笑，“请坐下吧。光是看着你我就累了。”

Feeling braver, he took a seat by the redhead. "How is she?"  
他感觉胆子大了些，便在红发女孩旁边坐下。“她怎么样了？”

"Hikari? She's fine. She's strong, you know? She'll make a great mother, I think. She was considering names for the boy. She thought maybe Shinji would be nice, after you."  
"光？她没事的。她很坚强，你知道的吧？我觉得她会成为一位伟大的母亲。她正在考虑给男孩起名字。她想或许‘真嗣’会不错，以你为名。"

"What? Really?" "什么？真的吗？"

"Yeah, either that or Kensuke. I told her she shouldn't give her child such a terrible name."  
"是啊，要么就是‘健介’。我告诉她不该给孩子起这么糟糕的名字。"

"Hey!" Kensuke stammered, only to realize whom he was speaking to, and recoiled, afraid to be beaten by the devil's tongue.  
"嘿！" 真嗣结巴道，随即意识到自己在和谁说话，便退缩了，生怕被那恶毒的舌头所伤。

"Are you feeling okay, though?" Shinji asked, tentatively placing a hand on her shoulder, concerned for his safety by making physical contact with the German girl.  
"不过，你感觉还好吗？" 真嗣小心翼翼地将手放在她的肩上，担心与这位德国女孩发生身体接触会带来危险。

"Yeah, I'm fine, just tired," Asuka replied, "When we get home, I need to go straight to bed, you know?"  
"嗯，我没事，只是累了，" 明日香回答，"等我们回家后，我得直接上床睡觉，你知道的吧？"

"Oh, okay," Shinji replied, frowning slightly.  
“哦，好吧，”真嗣回答道，微微皱起了眉头。

Asuka scratched the skin behind her ear, brushing aside her hair from her eyes, and, finally, placed a hand on her chest.  
明日香挠了挠耳后的皮肤，将头发从眼前拨开，最后把手放在胸前。

The engagement ring around her finger was clear to see.  
她手指上的订婚戒指清晰可见。

So was that ring's partner on Shinji's finger.  
那枚戒指在真嗣手指上的伴侣亦是如此。

**Part 2 第二部分**

Leaving the bathroom, the young adult known as Shinji Ikari glanced down at the bed partially illuminated by the light filtering behind him. He watched the lovely German in his bed turn over, her scarlet hair twisting underneath her light weight, her flexed fingers pressed against her lips in her slumber, as though she were trying to pull herself into a loose fetal position. She moaned softly in the back of her throat as Shinji approached, sitting down gently beside her to avoid invoking her wrath. To think that, when they were young, Asuka wouldn't have even let him get THAT close.  
离开浴室，被称为碇真嗣的年轻人瞥了一眼那张被身后光线部分照亮的床。他看着床上那位美丽的德国少女翻身，她那鲜红的头发在她轻盈的身躯下缠绕，弯曲的手指紧贴着嘴唇，仿佛在睡梦中试图将自己蜷缩成一个松散的胎儿姿势。随着真嗣的靠近，她喉咙深处发出轻微的呻吟声，真嗣轻轻地坐在她旁边，以免激起她的怒火。回想起来，在他们年幼时，明日香甚至不会让他靠得那么近。

He would've been too terrified to even get NEAR her.  
他本会害怕得连靠近她都不敢。

Terrified? No, not really terrified, but just unwilling to hear her shout and scream like she used to do all the time. Sure, they were just teens in the years before Third Impact, but even so, he wondered if he had loved her even then. When all had gone to Hell as the clock was minutes to midnight, she was the one he went to, who he begged for help, for attention. It was always her, not Misato, not Rei, certainly not his father, her. Of course, then he had done that horrible thing to her, a thing that he felt disgusted by. His psychologists, as following the hell of Third Impact they were all given well-needed psychologists, told him that what he did was just an act after being forced to kill the one person who said he loved him after watching every one of those near and dear to Shinji either lose their minds, die, or emotionally abandon him. He was just desperate, and wasn't in a right state of mind to make proper decisions.  
害怕？不，并非真的害怕，只是不愿再听到她像以前那样大喊大叫。没错，他们在第三次冲击前的那些年都还只是青少年，但即便如此，他不禁怀疑自己当时是否已经爱上了她。当一切陷入地狱，时钟即将敲响午夜的钟声时，他是去找她，向她求助，渴望她的关注。总是她，不是美里，不是丽，更不是他的父亲，是她。当然，后来他做了那件可怕的事，一件让他感到厌恶的事。在第三次冲击的炼狱之后，他们都得到了急需的心理医生，他们告诉他，他所做的一切只是在被迫杀死那个声称爱他的人之后的行为，眼看着身边亲近的人一个个精神崩溃、死去或情感上抛弃他。他只是绝望了，精神状态并不适合做出正确的决定。

That being said, he still hated what he did.  
尽管如此，他仍然憎恨自己所做的一切。

He didn't have the right, no matter how the doctors rationalized, to masturbate over his comatose friends.  
无论医生们如何合理化，他都没有权利对着昏迷的朋友自慰。

He sat down next to the girl, only to tentatively reach out for her, but drew his hand away, despite the band around his finger that he had given to her one-month prior. He glanced at it, in a dazed sort of way, and remembered the preparation it took to actually gather enough courage to go and propose to the German. For someone like Shinji, that was easier said than done. It wasn't like he was completely pathetic, just somewhat pathetic. That's how Shinji saw it, anyway. The fact of the matter was that the German, the Second Child, Asuka, was, for all intents and purposes, a tough girl to understand. Even now, YEARS after they first met, he didn't know much about her. He knew that her mother had died, although he didn't know how, he knew she still didn't care for her stepmother, or to be honest any of her family, all that much, how she still prided herself on her abilities as an Eva Pilot despite not being in the cockpit of the Eva for at least a decade, but most of what he knew of her was from the period of time he had spent with her.  
他坐在女孩旁边，小心翼翼地伸出手去触碰她，却又缩了回来，尽管手指上还戴着一个月前他送给她的戒指。他有些茫然地看了一眼戒指，想起了当初鼓起勇气向那位德国人求婚所做的准备。对于真嗣这样的人来说，说起来容易做起来难。他并不完全可悲，只是有点可悲。至少真嗣自己是这么看的。事实是，那位德国人，二号适格者明日香，从各方面来说都是一个难以理解的女孩。即使现在，在他们初次相遇多年之后，他对她的了解依然不多。他知道她的母亲去世了，虽然不知道原因，他知道她仍然不喜欢她的继母，或者说她对任何家人都不太在意，她仍然以自己作为 EVA 驾驶员的能力为傲，尽管至少十年没有驾驶过 EVA 了，但他对她的了解大多来自与她共度的那段时间。

As he laid down beside her, his mind wandered away, off into a distant time, years ago, until he had returned to that blood-red sea and dead looking beach, with the massive pieces of Rei Ayanami's naked body, pieces that dwarfed skyscrapers, drifting eerily in the water, buoyant somehow despite their mass. The girl known as Asuka Langley Sohryu was currently sleeping on the sand. It had probably been a few weeks since she had returned, for, despite still being in that red plug suit of hers, stained with even darker crimson blood, Shinji had removed the bandages around her arm and the eye patch on her eye. Although surgery had rid the German of any trace of these injuries, back then, they were infected and flaming. Her arm, the arm that had been bisected in her final battle, had somehow healed up down the middle, but not without leaving a great big scar. Her eye, gouged out in that same battle, had partially healed when she returned from the sea of LCL. Although the eyeball itself occupied her eye socket, it was completely blind, and, occasionally, she cried crimson tears. However, what agonized the scarlet haired girl the most was her organs.  
当他躺倒在她的身旁，思绪飘散，穿越时空，回到多年前，回到那片血红的海与死寂的沙滩，巨大的绫波零裸体残骸，其体积超越摩天大楼，诡异地漂浮在水中，尽管质量巨大却不知为何能浮起。被称为惣流·明日香·兰格雷的女孩此刻正躺在沙滩上沉睡。她归来可能已有数周，因为尽管仍穿着那件沾满更深暗红血迹的红色插入栓服，真嗣已将她手臂上的绷带和眼上的眼罩取下。虽然手术已让这位德国少女身上再无这些伤痕的痕迹，但那时，它们感染严重，如火焚身。她那在最终战斗中被斩断的手臂，不知怎的从中线愈合，却留下一道巨大的疤痕。那只在那场战斗中被挖出的眼睛，从 LCL 之海归来时已部分愈合。虽然眼球占据了眼窝，却完全失明，偶尔还会流出鲜红的泪水。然而，最令这位红发少女痛苦的是她的内脏。

In the battle with the Mass Production Evas, Asuka's Evangelion had been disemboweled. Due to the great level of synchronization with her Eva, her organs too had been skewered inside of her body. At least that's how Asuka had explained it after she had recovered from the shock of dying and returning to life in this Hell. Shinji wasn't sure just how much damage Asuka had retained in her returning to life, and he was not knowledgeable when it came to the human anatomy.  
在与量产型 EVA 的战斗中，明日香的 EVA 被开膛破肚。由于与她的 EVA 高度同步，她的内脏也被刺穿在体内。至少明日香在从死亡和重生于这个地狱的震惊中恢复后是这样解释的。真嗣不确定明日香重生后还保留了多少伤害，他对人体解剖学也不甚了解。

All he knew was that, when she cried out in pain and began gagging on her own blood, he was afraid.  
他所知道的是，当她痛苦地呼喊并开始咳血时，他感到害怕。

Shinji had weaved a makeshift blanket together using reeds he had found on the side of the beach. It was sloppy, ill-made, but it was enough to keep one warm in the cold nights on that beach, waiting for someone else to return. Crabs and other sea animals had returned, so surely living humans were next. He had glanced over at Asuka, who was tossing and turning on the sandy beach. He had approached her, and, tentatively, laid the blanket over her, the stiff reeds splintering as he attempted to tuck the blanket around her, hoping it would keep her warm.  
真嗣用他在海滩边找到的芦苇编织了一条临时毯子。虽然做得粗糙，但足以在海滩上寒冷的夜晚保暖，等待其他人归来。螃蟹和其他海洋生物已经回来了，所以活人应该也快了。他瞥了一眼在沙滩上辗转反侧的明日香。他走近她，试探性地把毯子盖在她身上，试图用僵硬的芦苇将毯子围在她周围，希望这能让她保持温暖。

He needed her. 他需要她。

He needed someone. 他需要某个人。

Before he could finish covering her cold svelte body with the reeds, however, her eyes snapped open. She pushed herself up, ripping the reed blanket to pieces. Shinji had watched as all that hard work, all that time and effort putting together some sort of protection from the cold environment, turn out to be all for naught. Shinji didn't even see Asuka vomit a profuse amount of blood as she gasped for air, crying to herself as she squeezed her side. He only noticed her plight when she fell to the ground, twitching slightly on the floor.  
然而，在他用芦苇覆盖她冰冷纤细的身体之前，她的眼睛突然睁开了。她猛地坐起身，将芦苇毯撕成碎片。真嗣眼睁睁看着自己辛苦编织的、为了抵御寒冷环境的保护措施化为乌有。他甚至没注意到明日香在喘息中吐出大量鲜血，一边哭泣一边紧按着侧腹。直到她倒在地上，微微抽搐时，他才注意到她的困境。

"Asuka!" he had shouted, darting to her side, reaching out for her.  
"明日香！" 他大喊着，疾步冲到她身边，伸出手想要触碰她。

He slapped his hand away.  
他猛地拍开了他的手。

"Don't touch me," Asuka whispered in her weak voice, between gasps of air, "Don't get near me. Don't look at me. I don't want to see your disgusting face ever again."  
"别碰我，" 明日香用微弱的声音低语，每说一句都伴随着急促的呼吸，"别靠近我。别看我。我再也不想看到你那张令人作呕的脸。

Shinji could only stare in shock. All he wanted to do was help her. That was it. It couldn't be a sin to want to help the only other human being alive with him, right? Surely she didn't have to be this cruel, this harsh, to him. All he wanted to do was help. That was it. Just help out a little bit, and she was hurting him. "But I—"  
"真嗣只能震惊地盯着她。他只想帮助她，仅此而已。想要帮助唯一与他共存的另一个人类，这怎么可能是罪呢？她肯定不必对他如此残忍，如此严厉。他只想帮忙，仅此而已。只是想帮一点忙，而她却在伤害他。“但我——””

"Don't speak!" Asuka shrieked, only to vomit out blood once more.  
“别说话！”明日香尖叫道，随即再次吐出鲜血。

"You're—" Shinji was interrupted when Asuka slammed her backhand across his face. He fell against the sandy floor, his face red, his lip bleeding slightly.  
“你——”真嗣话未说完，就被明日香一记反手扇在脸上。他跌倒在沙地上，脸颊通红，嘴唇微微出血。

"This is all your fault," Asuka mumbled, barely able to speak as she quivered in pain, clutching herself as she tried to steady herself, "All your fault. You let them kill me. You let them kill mama. And all you did was just sit there on your ass and listen to them rip me to shreds! You didn't do anything! You could have helped, stopped them from eating me or disemboweling me or stabbing me, but oh no! You chose to come out once I was in shreds! You bastard! You let mama die!"  
"这都是你的错，" 明日香喃喃自语，痛苦得几乎无法言语，她颤抖着，紧紧抱住自己试图稳定下来，"都是你的错。你让他们杀了我。你让他们杀了妈妈。而你只是坐在那里，听着他们把我撕成碎片！你什么都没做！你本可以帮忙，阻止他们吃掉我或开膛破肚或刺伤我，但是哦不！你选择等我被撕成碎片后才出现！你这个混蛋！你让妈妈死了！"

"Mama?" To this day, Shinji had no idea what she was talking about. He assumed she was a little hysterical, maybe even a tad confused, following her death. He wouldn't know. Unlike her, he had never died.  
"妈妈？" 直到今天，真嗣仍不明白她在说什么。他猜想她可能有点歇斯底里，甚至有些混乱，毕竟她刚经历过死亡。他无从得知。与她不同，他从未死过。

Asuka fell to her knees, holding herself weakly as she whispered, softly, "Mama, I'm ready. Please, let's die together. Please. Just this once. Please? I'm ready now, mama."  
明日香跪倒在地，虚弱地抱着自己，轻声细语，"妈妈，我准备好了。请，让我们一起死吧。请。就这一次。好吗？我现在准备好了，妈妈。"

"What's wrong?" “怎么了？”

Shinji woke up, sweating profusely, as he turned to see Asuka, a confused expression on her face, in his bed, not vomiting blood, not hitting him violently, not begging to die with her mother, but just there, staring at him, an eyebrow raised. "Huh? What do you mean by that?" Shinji finally managed to say, knowing full well he must have been tossing and turning in bed.  
真嗣醒来，满头大汗，转身看到明日香在他床上，脸上带着困惑的表情，没有吐血，没有暴力地打他，没有哭喊着要和母亲一起死，只是在那里，盯着他，眉毛一挑。“嗯？你什么意思？”真嗣终于开口说道，他很清楚自己肯定在床上辗转反侧。

"You were fidgeting around. You looked upset, like, really upset. I mean, were you having another flashback or something?"  
“你在床上动来动去的。看起来很不安，真的非常不安。我是说，你是不是又在做噩梦了？”

"Yeah, I guess," Shinji confessed.  
"是啊，我想是吧，" 真嗣坦白道。

"You guess, huh? That just figures. Getting all nostalgic on us once Hikari has a baby. Typical." She sighed, resting a hand on her breasts as she asked, calmly, "So what was it this time?"  
"你只是猜猜，嗯？这很正常。一旦光有了孩子，就开始对我们怀旧。典型的。" 她叹了口气，一手放在胸前，平静地问道，"这次又是什么？"

"I don't remember—" "我不记得了——"

"C'mon! You know you're not going to feel any better unless you talk about it, and besides, what kind of an answer is you don't remember anyway!? That's like freaking telling someone that you heard a really big secret and you said, 'Oh! I can't tell you! It's a secret!' You don't just start talking about something only to stop talking about it five seconds later! It's a freakin' tease!"  
"来吧！你知道不谈出来你不会感觉好些的，再说了，‘我不记得了’这种回答算什么嘛！这就像你听到了一个大秘密，然后说，‘哦！我不能告诉你！这是秘密！’你不能只开了个头，五秒钟后就闭嘴不谈了！这简直是耍人嘛！"

Resigning, he said, simply, "The beach."  
他无奈地叹了口气，简单地说：“海边。”

"Oh, that." Her face deflated somewhat. "That was years ago, and you know it."  
"哦，那个啊。" 她的表情有些泄气。"那是好几年前的事了，你也知道。"

"I know, but still, you were so—"  
"我知道，但还是，你当时那么——"

"You know, these blankets sure are heavy," Asuka interrupted, pulling herself out of bed, "It's getting hot in there."  
"你知道吗，这些毯子确实很重，" 明日香打断道，从床上爬起来，"里面越来越热了。"

"What do you mean? The blankets are perfectly fine," Shinji replied, confused.  
"你什么意思？毯子明明很好啊，" 真嗣回答，感到困惑。"

"Oh, I guess I won't take them off, then," Asuka replied, simply, as she removed her shirt.  
"哦，那我就不脱了。" 明日香简单地回答，同时脱下了她的衬衫。

"What're you doing!?" Shinji stammered, staring at her incredulously.  
"你在干什么！？" 真嗣结结巴巴地说，难以置信地盯着她。

"I'm taking my clothes off, what does it look like?" she replied, simply.  
"我在脱衣服，你看不出来吗？" 她简单地回答。

"Yeah, I can see that, but why!?"  
"是啊，我能理解，但为什么！？"

"Well, if you won't let me take off the blanket, how else do you expect me to cool down?" she asked, simply.  
""好吧，如果你不让我掀开毯子，那你还指望我怎么降温呢？"" 她简单地问道。

"Well—" "嗯——"

"What? Afraid to sleep with a woman without any clothing on?" she teased, in a mocking tone.  
"什么？怕和一个没穿衣服的女人睡觉吗？" 她用嘲弄的语气逗弄道。

Feeling a minor sensation of déjà vu, Shinji replied, indignantly, "No! I'm not afraid! Go ahead and strip! See what I care!"  
感到一丝似曾相识的感觉，真嗣愤愤不平地回答："不！我不怕！尽管脱吧！看我会在乎吗！"

"Okay," she replied, in a surprisingly pleased tone. She ripped the remainder of her clothing off, revealing her naked form, save for her bra and panties. Shinji noticed the long thin scar that ran up her torso. When doctors and hospitals began to return, they had operated on her. It wound up that numerous organs had been damaged. It was a miracle she had survived for weeks on the beach like that. They told her that she must have someone high up looking after her.  
"好吧，" 她以出乎意料的愉快语气回答。她撕掉了剩下的衣服，除了胸罩和内裤外，全身赤裸。真嗣注意到她躯干上那条细长的疤痕。当医生和医院开始恢复运作时，他们为她做了手术。结果发现她的多个器官受损。她能在海滩上存活数周简直是个奇迹。他们告诉她，一定是有位高层在守护着她。

She said it was her mama.  
她说那是她妈妈。

"Okay, now don't think anything dirty or I'll kill you," Asuka replied as she curled up next to Shinji, pressing her cheek to his bosom.  
"好了，现在别想什么乱七八糟的，不然我杀了你，" 明日香一边回答，一边蜷缩在真嗣旁边，将脸颊贴在他的胸膛上。

"Uh—" With that statement, Shinji's eyes focused on his fiancé's cleavage. He couldn't help it! You couldn't just say "Don't think dirty thoughts" and NOT attract a man's attention to those key locations. He hated himself for it, but he couldn't help it. She didn't help situations, either, when she began to glare at him through narrowed eyes, her nails digging into his chest, with a look that clearly expressed her utmost desire to strangle him.  
"呃——" 听到这话，真嗣的目光不由自主地落在了未婚妻的胸前。他控制不住自己！你不能说“别想歪念头”却不引起男人对那些关键部位的注意。他为此感到厌恶自己，但他就是控制不住。她也没让情况好转，当她开始眯起眼睛瞪着他，指甲掐进他的胸口，那眼神明显表达了她最强烈的愿望——掐死他。

"You're thinking something dirty, aren't you?"  
"你在想什么不正经的事，对吧？"

"Sorry?" Shinji replied, inching away slowly from Asuka. He watched as his fiancé's fist rose into the air, through the blankets, as he lightly punched his shoulder.  
"什么？" 真嗣回答道，慢慢地从明日香身边挪开。他看着未婚妻的拳头穿过毯子，轻轻地打在他的肩膀上。

"I'll kill you in the morning, okay?"  
"我明天早上就杀了你，好吗？"

"Alright?" "还好吗？"

"Hey, Shinji?" "嘿，真嗣？"

"Yeah?" "嗯？"

"I'm freezing! Taking off my clothes was not a bright idea. Can I get a little closer?"  
"我快冻僵了！脱掉衣服真不是个好主意。我能靠得近一点吗？"

"Uh, okay." "呃，好吧。"

"Thanks." The German moved closer, inching closer and closer until he could feel her breasts press against his chest, her soft torso pressed up against his, her firm legs wrapped around his, her arms curled around his chest. He always knew that Asuka was about as tall as he was, but to have her up against him like this just proved to him that either he was a small guy or she was a pretty tall woman. After a few moments, she murmured, "Your breath is tickling me."  
"谢谢。" 德国人挪得更近了，一点点靠近，直到他能感觉到她的胸部紧贴着他的胸膛，柔软的身躯紧贴着他，结实的双腿环绕着他，双臂环抱着他的胸膛。他一直知道明日香和他差不多高，但像这样紧贴着他，只是证明了他要么是个小个子，要么她是个相当高的女人。过了一会儿，她低声说："你的呼吸在逗弄我。"

Shinji knew he had experienced this once before. This sounded so oddly familiar, but he just couldn't place the—wait a second! Asuka had said all of this sort of stuff before their first kiss together! She had used some sort of excuse to find themselves into a situation to reach her designated goal, in that case kissing him, goaded him into going her way by calling him afraid, and had even said how Shinji's breath tickled her. The only question is why would do something like that right now? What did she have to gain by stripping almost completely naked in bed with Shinji almost immediately after Hikari had a baby, which could only be created by having—  
真嗣知道他以前经历过这种情况。这听起来如此熟悉，但他就是想不起来——等等！明日香在他们第一次接吻之前说过类似的话！她用某种借口让自己陷入一种情境，以达到她的预定目标，在那次是吻他，用他害怕来激他，甚至还说过真嗣的呼吸逗弄她。唯一的问题是，她现在为什么要这么做？在光莉刚生完孩子之后，她几乎全裸地和真嗣躺在床上，这只能是通过——

Oh.

**Part 3 第三部分**

"Hey! Get back here! Stop crying!"  
嘿！回来！别哭了！

"You know, it's strange seeing you as a mom, Hikari."  
"你知道吗，看到你当妈妈的样子真奇怪，光。"

"You really think so?" "你真的这么觉得？"

It was a shock to see her freckled, brown haired friend as anything other than the class representative she had first met in middle school, a girl who took charge of her classes with her loud, occasionally militaristic orders. Still, Hikari Suzuhara, as Asuka still had to remember was now her full name, looked almost a little comical after a few weeks of being a mom. She was clinging to her little boy, whom Hikari called Shinji, but Asuka called Shin-chan, who was putting up quite a fit. They had changed his diaper, but it looked like he was more interested in something else, specifically the fluid contents of Hikari's plumped breasts.  
看到她这位有着雀斑、棕色头发的朋友，不再是中学时初次见到的那个班级代表，那个以响亮、偶尔带有军事化口吻发号施令的女孩，确实让人震惊。不过，尽管须原光现在已经是她的全名，须原光，但当了几个星期的妈妈后，她看起来几乎有点滑稽。她紧紧抱着她的小男孩，光称他为真嗣，而明日香则叫他真酱，小家伙正在闹脾气。他们刚给他换了尿布，但他似乎对别的东西更感兴趣，特别是光那丰满乳房中的乳汁。

Asuka had to admit that, for a woman who had only given birth a couple weeks ago, she sure had adjusted well to the new situations related to motherhood. Sure, she hadn't lost all the baby fat that she had accumulated while bringing her bouncing rugrat into the world, but she had lost a good deal of it, enough to the point where she looked much like her old self again. With a smile on her face, she pressed her child's lips against her exposed breast, and breastfed him. It was only after a few seconds that she realized that Asuka was in the room with her, watching this somewhat personal moment. Blushing, she said, "Sorry about this."  
"明日香不得不承认，对于一个仅仅几周前才分娩的女人来说，她确实很好地适应了与母亲身份相关的新情况。当然，她还没有完全减掉怀孕期间积累的婴儿肥，但她已经减掉了不少，足以让她看起来又像过去的自己了。她面带微笑，将孩子的嘴唇贴在她裸露的乳房上，开始哺乳。几秒钟后，她才意识到明日香在房间里，正看着这个略显私密的时刻。她脸红了，说道：“抱歉让你看到这个。””

"Hey, don't worry about it. It's natural," she shrugged, "Nothin' awkward about feeding your baby."  
"“嘿，别在意。这是很自然的，”她耸耸肩，“喂宝宝没什么尴尬的。””

"Thanks. Where's Shinji?"  
"“谢谢。真嗣去哪儿了？””

"He's sucking on your—" "他在吸你的——"

"Not that one!" "不是那个！"

"Oh! You mean the idiot! Well, he's at work right now," Asuka replied, scratching her cheek absentmindedly. The idiot. The words seemed to ring off her tongue, almost in an affectionate sort of way, as though she were beating him with a smile on her face. It was strange. Sure, she could be abusive, but he never did leave her, did he? He never did abandon her. Sure, in the past they had their struggles, but now, everything had balanced itself out just about right, hadn't it?  
"哦！你是说那个笨蛋！嗯，他现在在工作，" 明日香回答道，心不在焉地挠了挠脸颊。笨蛋。这个词似乎从她嘴里蹦出来，带着一种近乎宠溺的意味，仿佛她是在笑着揍他。这很奇怪。当然，她可能会很刻薄，但他从未离开过她，不是吗？他从未抛弃过她。没错，过去他们有过争执，但现在，一切都恰到好处地平衡了，不是吗？

"You really like him, don't you?" Hikari replied, smiling.  
"你真的很喜欢他，对吧？" 光笑着回答。

"He's just an idiot," Asuka restated.  
"他就是个白痴，" 明日香重申道。

"Yeah, but he cooks, helps clean around the house while you just laze there eating potato chips," Hikari pointed out.  
"是啊，但他会做饭，还会帮忙打扫家里，而你只是懒洋洋地躺在那里吃薯片，" 光指出。

"Blunt today, are we?" "今天这么迟钝，是吧？"

Hikari giggled again, blushing deep red. "Sorry."  
光再次咯咯笑起来，脸红得深。“对不起。”

"Don't worry about it. Hey, where's that other stooge, Toji?" Asuka hadn't seen him once since she set foot in the Suzuhara residence. It was strange. It wasn't uncommon for Toji to spend time with Shinji while she was here, but at least she saw him. Now it was as though he had been a ghost that had recently been exorcised.  
"别担心。嘿，那个跟班户次去哪儿了？" 明日香自从踏进铃原家就没见过他一次。这很奇怪。户次和真嗣一起度过时间并不罕见，但至少她能看到他。现在他好像是个刚被驱走的鬼魂。

"Well, he's out getting stuff for the baby, or at least that's what he said the moment he heard you were coming," Hikari replied.  
"嗯，他出去给宝宝买东西了，或者至少他是这么说的，就在听说你要来的时候，"光回答道。

"Dummkopf," Asuka murmured, resentfully. That idiot just took off an ran just because of her arrival? What an asshole! He was all fun and games with Shinji, but the moment Shinji's soon-to-be wife arrived, he had to get out of there! Figures. What an asshole. Sure, she wasn't always the sweetest person to him, but still, did he have to prove to her that he was an asshole?  
"笨蛋，"明日香不满地嘟囔着。那个白痴就因为她的到来而跑掉了？真是个混蛋！他和真嗣玩得挺开心的，但真嗣的未婚妻一出现，他就得溜之大吉！真是的。真是个混蛋。没错，她对他并不总是那么友善，但他有必要向她证明自己是个混蛋吗？

"Well, in all fairness, you do have a tendency to yell at him," Hikari said.  
"好吧，公平地说，你确实有对他大吼大叫的倾向，"光说。

"Well, yeah, but that's only when he's being a complete and utter moron."  
"嗯，是的，但那只是当他完全彻底像个白痴的时候。"

"But it's half of the time you're with us?"  
"但那几乎是你和我们在一起的一半时间？"

"Er ist ein Idiot!" Asuka replied, bluntly.  
"他就是个白痴！" 明日香直截了当地回答道。

"Come again?" “再说一遍？”

"He's an idiot!" she replied, a laugh on her tongue, but, midway through her giggle, she clasped her hand on her mouth as she struggled to hold back a sudden wave of nausea, a wave that had hit her without warning, without any previous signs, without any sort of ANYTHING preceding it. She darted to the bathroom, where she knelt down by the toilet seat as she threw it open, lowering her mouth to the open water, waiting for vomit to spill from her mouth.  
“他是个傻瓜！”她笑着回答，但笑声中段，她突然用手捂住嘴，努力抑制住一阵突如其来的恶心感，这感觉毫无预警，没有任何先兆，没有任何前兆。她冲进浴室，跪在马桶前，打开盖子，将头靠近水面，等待着呕吐物的涌出。

Thankfully, after waiting for a few minutes, the sudden urge to vomit faded away, but the nausea hadn't.  
幸运的是，几分钟后，突如其来的呕吐冲动消退了，但恶心感并未消失。

"Hey! Are you alright?" Hikari asked, darting into the room after placing her baby safely into his crib.  
"嘿！你还好吗？" 光问道，将宝宝安全地放进婴儿床后快步走进房间。

"Yeah, just felt a little sick all of a sudden," she replied, holding a hand on her lower belly as she rose to her feet.  
"嗯，只是突然感觉有点不舒服，" 她回答，一手按在腹部下方，缓缓站起身来。

"Are you sick?" "你生病了吗？"

"A little, I think. I'm not sure. This has been happening for the last few days, since last Monday, so I guess I'm just having a stomach virus or something like that, you know? It's nothing to be too worried about. Just a little bit of medicine and—"  
"我觉得有点儿。我不确定。这种情况已经持续了几天，从上周一开始，所以我猜我只是得了胃病毒之类的，你知道吗？没什么好太担心的。吃点药就好了——"

"Uh, are you sure about that?" Hikari asked.  
"呃，你确定吗？" 光问道。

"What do you mean?" "你什么意思？"

"You don't get sick too often," Hikari replied.  
"你不太常生病，" 光回答道。

"Yeah, so this is just one of those infrequent times I'm actually feeling under the—"  
"是啊，所以这只是那些不常见的时刻之一，我其实感觉不太舒服——"

"When was the last time you had your period?"  
"你上次来月经是什么时候？"

"Well—wait a second! Just what're you implying by that!?" snapped Asuka, staring dumbfounded at her friend, her eyes wavering in their sockets.  
"哎——等等！你这话是什么意思！？" 明日香厉声说道，目瞪口呆地盯着她的朋友，眼珠在眼眶里摇摆不定。

"Well, you might be pregnant for all we know," Hikari replied, "I mean, I felt really nauseous, and if you've been feeling nauseous since last Monday, and today's Sunday, that means you've been feeling this way for a week!"  
"嗯，我们也不知道你是不是怀孕了，" 光子回答道，"我是说，我当时感觉非常恶心，如果你从上周一就开始感到恶心，而今天是周日，那就意味着你已经这样持续一周了！"

"So?"

"That's a little more than a few days," Hikari replied, "Look, maybe I'm just jumping to conclusions, but have you and Shinji, er, well, have you—" Asuka's face, which had turned a darker shade of red than the hair on her head, answered Hikari's question for her. "You know, I have a pregnancy test think left over from when I was pregnant. I should probably get that right now."  
"那可不止几天了，" 光子回答道，"听着，也许我只是有点草率下结论，但你和真嗣，呃，嗯，你们有没有——" 明日香的脸，已经红得比她的头发还要深，替她回答了光子的问题。"你知道，我怀孕时还剩了一个验孕棒。我现在应该去拿那个。"

"I'm not pregnant! I'd know if I was pregnant!"  
"我没有怀孕！如果怀孕了我会知道的！"

Shinji was sitting behind his desk, staring up at the ceiling as he always did during these slow days. The fact that he was a former pilot of the Evangelion seemed to be enough reason for him to be given a job at NERV, but the fact that he had been assigned as one of the heads of the newly instated NERV seemed a little extreme. He wasn't a soldier, didn't know anything about the new society, which had focused itself on militaristic defense and the aid of nations throughout the world who were recovering after the horrors of Third Impact. His job essentially meant working out peace treaties between nations NERV seemed to like, proposing to his superiors to veto other peace treaties in order to eliminate cruel and abusive governments, and, of course, searching for souls returning from the sea of LCL, which had shrunk in the years following Third Impact. It had shrunk from a massive planet-sized ocean to a sea located near the Tigris and Eurphrates Rivers, where, according to the numerous religious cults that had sprang up following the horrors of Instrumentality, that the Abrahamic Bible designated that the Garden of Eden existed.  
真嗣坐在办公桌后，像往常一样盯着天花板发呆。他曾是 EVA 驾驶员，这似乎足以让他获得在 NERV 工作的资格，但被任命为新成立的 NERV 高层之一，似乎有些过头了。他不是军人，对新社会一无所知，这个社会已经转向军事防御，并帮助世界各地从第三次冲击的恐怖中恢复过来的国家。他的工作基本上是协调 NERV 喜欢的国家之间的和平条约，向他的上级提议否决其他和平条约以消除残酷和虐待的政府，当然，还要寻找从 LCL 之海归来的灵魂，这个海在第三次冲击后的几年里已经缩小了。它从覆盖整个行星的巨大海洋缩小到位于底格里斯河和幼发拉底河附近的一个海，根据第三次冲击后涌现的众多宗教团体所说，那里是圣经中指定的伊甸园所在地。

Garden of Eden? What a joke.  
伊甸园？真是笑话。

The phone at his desk rang. As he answered it, he expected to hear his superiors on the other line. "Hello, this is Shinji Ikari speaking." He expected some order, some new job for him to handle. However, he DIDN'T expect a high pitched female voice to shout at him from the top of her lungs, a voice so loud that she had to draw the phone at least an arm's length away from his ear to actually hear properly.  
他桌上的电话响了。他接起电话，以为会听到上级的声音。“你好，我是碇真嗣。”他以为会接到什么命令，有什么新任务要处理。然而，他万万没想到会是一个尖锐的女性声音从电话那头尖叫出来，声音大到他不得不把电话至少拿开一臂之遥才能听清楚。

"You stupid idiot! How could you?! You stupid, stupid, jerk! You disgusting pervert, I should've never trusted you for a second! Schwein! Dummkopf! Bastard! Seducer! Schmutz der Erde!"  
“你这个大笨蛋！你怎么能这样？！你这个蠢货，蠢货，混蛋！你这个恶心的变态，我真不该相信你哪怕一秒钟！猪！傻瓜！混账！诱骗者！地球上的污垢！”

"Wait, just hold on a second Asuka—!"  
"等等，先别急，明日香——！"

"Don't you just tell me to hold on a second, you stupid idiot!"  
"别跟我说什么等一下，你这个大笨蛋！"

"Just what're you yelling about?"  
"你到底在嚷嚷什么？"

"Oh! Don't act like you don't know you idiot!"  
"哦！别装作你不知道，你这个白痴！"

"I don't know! You just started yelling at me and—" Shinji was interrupted when the door opened. In walked the elderly Commander Fuyutsuki, a man who had miraculously managed to keep his job, no, be promoted to head of NERV following the controversy NERV received following Third Impact.  
""我不知道！你突然对我大吼大叫，然后——"" 真嗣的话被开门声打断了。走进来的是年迈的指挥官冬月，一个在第三次冲击引发的争议后奇迹般保住职位，甚至被提拔为 NERV 负责人的男人。

"Ikari-san, we have—" "碇君，我们有——"

"Don't you just play stupid and act like the innocent little oaf everyone thinks you are! Schwein!"  
"别装傻充愣，表现得像大家以为的那个无辜小傻瓜一样！猪头！"

"On second thought, I'll leave you two alone." Fuyutsuki backed out of the room, closed the door over, and, if Shinji's ears didn't deceive him, sprinted as far away from the room as possible.  
"再一想，我还是让你们俩单独待着吧。" 冬月退出了房间，关上门，而且，如果真嗣的耳朵没听错的话，他飞快地跑得离房间越远越好。

Why did he have to leave him alone with this insanity?  
为什么他非得把他一个人留在这疯狂之中？

"But what's going on? I don't understand what's happening."  
"但这是怎么回事？我不明白发生了什么。"

On the other side of the line, Shinji could hear a second voice speak. He barely made out, "Asuka, let me speak to him for a second. You're being hysterical!" only to have the rest of Hikari Suzuhara's interruption blocked out by more of his fiancé's shouting.  
电话那头，真嗣能听到另一个声音说话。他勉强听出，"明日香，让我跟他说几句。你太激动了！"但随后铃原光希的打断被他未婚妻更多的喊叫声淹没了。

"You made me—you made me—"  
"你让我——你让我——"

"Made you what?" "让你什么？"

"Pregnant!" "怀孕了！"

Shinji stared at the phone for a moment or two, confused. Pregnant? Oh, wasn't that supposed to be a joyous event, filled with smiling and laughter, with a deeper connection of love and passion, without shouting and screaming? Why did everything have to be painful? "Uh, congratulations?"  
真嗣盯着手机愣了一会儿，感到困惑。怀孕？哦，那不应该是充满欢笑和喜悦，伴随着更深层次的爱与激情，而不是争吵和尖叫吗？为什么一切都如此痛苦？“呃，恭喜？”

"Don't you 'congratulations' me, you jerk! You made me pregnant! You seducing little—"  
"别跟我说'恭喜'，你这个混蛋！你让我怀孕了！你这个勾引人的小——"

"Seducing? I didn't seduce you!"  
"勾引？我可没勾引你！"

"Well, what about a few weeks ago when you essentially raped me in your bed? Hmmm?"  
"那几周前，你在床上几乎强奸了我，这又怎么说？嗯？"

"Raped you? What the hell are you talking about? You went into the bed with no clothing on and we made love!"  
"强奸你？你到底在说什么鬼话？你一丝不挂地上了床，我们明明是做爱了！"

"Oh, don't use that old blame me routine of yours! You need to accept responsibility for your actions, you jerk!"  
"哦，别再用你那老一套的怪罪我的伎俩了！你得为自己的行为负责，你这个混蛋！"

"How about you accept responsibilities for once? You went into a bed wearing nothing!"  
"你怎么不承担一次责任？你可是赤裸裸地上了床！"

"I was too wearing something!"  
"我确实穿了什么！"

"You were wearing panties and a bra, and were using the same tactics you used when we were kids when you made me kiss you! What was I supposed to think!?"  
"你只穿了内裤和胸罩，还用了我们小时候你让我亲你时的那套战术！我还能怎么想！？"

"Oh, don't use that old excuse on me again!"  
"哦，别再用那个老借口糊弄我了！"

"When was the last time I ever made that excuse before, anyway?"  
"话说回来，我上次用这个借口是什么时候了？"

"Oh! Don't change the subject!"  
"哦！别转移话题！"

"I didn't!" "我没有！"

"Oh, you stupid—Hey! Hikari! What're you—?"  
"哦，你这个笨蛋——嘿！光！你在——？"

The other end of the line began to ruffle and tremble. Shinji drew the phone closer to his ear, sure to hear Hikari's voice as opposed to Asuka's high pitched shrill. Thankfully, his expectations were fulfilled. "Hey, listen, don't mind her, she's just a little upset right now. She'll cool off once she adjusts to everything."  
电话那头开始沙沙作响，颤抖起来。真嗣将手机贴近耳朵，希望能听到光的温柔声音，而不是明日香那尖锐的嗓音。幸运的是，他的期望得到了满足。“嘿，听着，别在意她，她只是现在有点不高兴。等她适应了一切，就会冷静下来的。”

"Uh, okay." Cool off? He hoped that happened soon. If Asuka was upset with him, chances are he wouldn't even be let into the house, left outside of a barricaded door in the dark. The weatherman forecasted thunderstorms, too. "Listen, uh, how did you guys find out she was pregnant, exactly?"  
"呃，好吧。"冷静下来？他希望这能尽快发生。如果明日香对他生气了，很可能他连家门都进不去，只能被关在门外，在黑暗中面对紧闭的大门。天气预报还说会有雷暴。“听着，呃，你们是怎么知道她怀孕的，确切地说？”

"A pregnancy test." "一支验孕棒。"

"Oh, uh, how accurate is it?"  
"哦，呃，它的准确度如何？"

"Pretty accurate." "相当准确。"

"I see. Uh, thanks, Hikari."  
"我明白了。呃，谢谢，光。"

"Don't mention it." "不用谢。"

"I'm going to hang up now—"  
"我现在要挂电话了——"

"Dummkopf! Don't you dare hang up on me you idiot!" Shinji pulled the phone away from his ear in shock, staring at it, his eyes wide with fear, as though the wires would come alive to strangle him.  
"笨蛋！你敢挂我电话，你这个白痴！" 真嗣震惊地将电话从耳边拉开，盯着它，眼中满是恐惧，仿佛电线会活过来勒死他。

"I'm at work! I can't keep talking on the phone! I have to hang up now!"  
"我在上班！不能一直讲电话！我现在得挂了！"

"I hope they fire you, you son of a—" Shinji slammed the receiver down, exhaling slowly as he leaned back in his chair, staring up at the ceiling once more.  
"我希望他们炒了你，你个混蛋——" 真嗣猛地挂上听筒，缓缓呼气，靠回椅背，再次抬头望向天花板。

Pregnant? 怀孕了？

A child? 一个孩子？

Asuka? 明日香？

Father. 父亲。

**Part 4 第四部分**

"If you will do it, do it now! Otherwise, leave!"  
“如果你要做，现在就做！不然就别做！”

"I have a use for you."  
"我有你的用处。"

"Leave!" "离开！"

The voice of the ghost from his past haunted his mind, enveloped his concentration as he drove home. The thought of his fiancé being pregnant and the no doubt violent rage that awaited him at home was in the back of his head. No, the young adult known as Shinji Ikari was focused on a man from the past, a man who he had not seen for the past decade, a man who still haunted him after all this time. A man with a long chinstrap beard, glasses, white gloves, and a cold, calculating glare that would leave you shivering in your boots.  
来自过去的幽灵的声音萦绕在他的脑海中，笼罩着他的专注力，当他开车回家时。未婚妻怀孕的想法以及家中无疑等待着他的暴力愤怒在他脑海中挥之不去。不，被称为碇真嗣的年轻人正专注于一个来自过去的人，一个他十年来未曾见过的人，一个即使过了这么久仍然困扰着他的人。一个留着长长的下巴胡须、戴着眼镜、白色手套，以及一双冷酷、算计的眼神，足以让你在靴子里打颤的人。

"Father." “父亲。”

The father who abandoned him, who left him miserable and desperate in the world, alone, only to be a miserable wreck from childhood to adolescence. The horrors of Third Impact and the world that followed it had left him horror struck for the years after it, but every so often Shinji would remember the bastard of a father he had, unloving and uncaring. The only person he had ever met who had a kind thing to say about that man was Shinji Ikari's superior, the current Commander of NERV itself: Fuyutsuki.  
那个抛弃了他的父亲，让他在这个世界上孤独、绝望，从童年到青春期都只是一个悲惨的废人。第三次冲击及其后的世界留下的恐怖，让他多年后仍心有余悸，但时不时地，真嗣会想起他那个无情无爱的父亲。唯一一个对那个男人有好话的人，是真嗣·碇的上司，NERV 现任指挥官：冬月。

Shinji remembered when NERV had first been recommissioned by the World Government. Fuyutsuki, who had offered an explanation of the whole ordeal of Third Impact, was allowed to lead the organization, especially considering how Fuyutsuki decided to lend his effort reconstructing the Japanese government during the horrors of the early post-Third Impact world. Fuyutsuki was quick to hire all the old members of NERV, including the Eva pilots. Maya had been put in charge of the science department, Hyuga had become one of the head tacticians, Aoba was head of Weapon Development and the unofficial musician for the NERV Christmas parties, Misato was promoted to sub-commander, both he and Asuka were given high ranking jobs. Their schedules, thankfully, rarely clashed, so if they did have a child, they'd be able to raise—  
真嗣记得 NERV 最初被世界政府重新启用的时候。冬月副司令曾对整个第三次冲击事件做出了解释，因此被允许领导组织，尤其是在第三次冲击后初期世界的恐怖中，他决定贡献力量重建日本政府。冬月迅速招募了 NERV 的所有老成员，包括 EVA 驾驶员们。玛雅被任命为科学部门负责人，日向成为了首席战术师之一，青叶担任武器开发部门主管兼 NERV 圣诞派对的非官方音乐家，美里晋升为副指挥官，他和明日香也都获得了高阶职位。幸运的是，他们的日程很少冲突，所以如果他们有了孩子，也能够共同抚养——

Father. 父亲。

That set Shinji back on track. He remembered when Fuyutsuki had first hired him. Shinji had refused, or at least was hesitant. This was his father's company, not his. He didn't want to be reminded of that man, that bastard, anymore than he had to. It was then that Fuyutsuki had said, wearily, "You know, your father would've wanted me to give you this high paying job, you know? One day you'll know this."  
这使真嗣重新回到了正轨。他记得当初冬月第一次雇用他时的情景。真嗣拒绝了，或者说至少是犹豫不决。这是他父亲的公司，不是他的。他不想再被那个男人，那个混蛋，提醒任何关于他的事情。就在那时，冬月疲惫地说道：“你知道吗，你父亲会希望我给你这份高薪工作的，你知道吗？总有一天你会明白的。”

The man who left him alone as a child for years, only called him when he needed him, and left him an emotional train wreck would have wanted him to work in a corporation that had been labeled, in the modern media, "The Modern Illuminati" and "The Founders of Third Impact"?  
那个在他童年时将他独自留下多年，只在需要时才打电话给他，让他成为一个情感上的灾难的人，会希望他在一家被现代媒体称为“现代光明会”和“第三次冲击的创始人”的公司工作吗？

Yeah, that sounded like something he'd do.  
是啊，这听起来像是他会做的事情。

Apparently Fuyutsuki cared so deeply about his father that he had erected a statue in his honor outside the NERV entrance. After all, nowadays NERV was a public organization, no longer a secret Government society. Because it was public, people walked by the statue of Gendo Ikari standing majestically every day, and, every day, someone would throw rotten fruit against its bust. While Fuyutsuki would sometimes personally clean the statue to ensure it was in pristine condition, Shinji actually wished that, one day, he could throw a giant watermelon against his father's face so that it would splatter against his nose line, covering his face in red as he shouted all the things he couldn't say a decade ago.  
显然，冬月对父亲的深情厚意体现在他在 NERV 入口处为父亲竖立了一座雕像。毕竟，如今 NERV 已是一家公开机构，不再是秘密的政府社团。正因为公开，人们每天都会经过那尊庄严矗立的碇源堂雕像，而每天总有人向那雕像的胸像投掷腐烂的水果。尽管冬月有时会亲自清理雕像，确保其完好无损，但真嗣其实希望有一天能朝他父亲的脸扔一个巨大的西瓜，让它在鼻梁上炸开，满脸通红地喊出十年前无法说出口的一切。

None of those unsaid words were all too polite.  
那些未曾说出口的话，可都不怎么客气。

Still, when Shinji's son—er, child—was born, he's make sure he—or she—never had to suffer that horrible fate of having a father ignore him, of abandoning him—or her—entirely. Still, raising his child the way he wanted to raise him would mean Shinji returning home to face his violent, ill-tempered fiancé. She sounded so angry over the phone, so entirely furious. What was he going to do? She wasn't the type to exactly forgive and forget quickly. Years ago, Asuka was a more violent individual, especially following Third Impact.  
尽管如此，当真嗣的儿子——呃，孩子——出生时，他会确保他——或她——永远不会遭受那种可怕的命运，即被父亲忽视，被完全抛弃。然而，按照他想要的方式抚养孩子，意味着真嗣必须回家面对他那暴躁易怒的未婚妻。她在电话里听起来如此愤怒，完全怒不可遏。他该怎么办？她可不是那种轻易原谅和忘记的人。多年前，在第三次冲击之后，明日香变得更加暴力。

He pulled over at a supermarket, looking for some sort of way to stall, to escape needing to return home to face the horror of his German haired lover—no, good friend—no, acquaintance—no, mortal enemy. Anxiously, he withdrew his mp3 player, and escaped into the gentle music it supplied. His old SDAT player, even at the time he used it constantly antiquated, had vanished during the horror of Third Impact. He had sought to get a replacement, but, as it were, had never really came around to purchasing one. However, the mp3 player he used now was a gift from Asuka.

It had been a birthday present, his twenty first birthday. It had been a little more than a year or two since the world had fully recovered from the Hell of Third Impact. Most people often give others, on their twenty first birthday, something to signify the newfound privileges gained with their age. Toji, for example, bought him a pornographic DVD, much to both Hikari and Asuka's distaste. Kensuke, on the other hand, bought him a guidebook to the best bars in Tokyo-3. Misato had given him an expensive bottle of sake. Asuka would later joke that they were lucky that the bottle wasn't half empty by the time Shinji received it. Shinji expected things to allure him to the benefits of being an adult, but the gift that seemed to impact Shinji most was a gift that reminded him of the past.  
那是一件生日礼物，他二十一岁的生日礼物。自第三次冲击的炼狱后，世界全面复苏已过去了一两年。大多数人会在二十一岁生日时，送些象征新获特权的东西。比如，真治送了他一张色情 DVD，让美里和明日香都颇为反感。剑介则送了他一本东京-3 最佳酒吧指南。美里给了他一瓶昂贵的清酒。明日香后来开玩笑说，幸好瓶子在真嗣收到时还没空了一半。真嗣本以为会收到些吸引他享受成人生活的好处，但对他影响最深的礼物，却是唤起过往回忆的那一份。

"It's not like I needed to put that much thought into it," Asuka had rationalized after Shinji opened the present, turning the case over and over to see the present from every possible angle, "I just remember how you liked listening to that old tape player of yours all the time when we were younger. I mean, I knew that you wanted to have a tape player or whatever it was you had, but this is better. It has 100 gigabytes of memory, so you can fit a bunch of songs on it, and play some games like Solitaire on it. Also, it comes with a dozen songs on it, and you can play videos on it. So yeah, no big deal."  
"我又不是需要花那么多心思去想这个，" 在真嗣打开礼物后，明日香这样辩解道，她不停地翻转着盒子，从各个可能的角度观察这份礼物，"我只是记得你小时候总是喜欢听你那个旧磁带播放器。我是说，我知道你想要一个磁带播放器或者你原来有的那种东西，但这个更好。它有 100GB 的内存，你可以放很多歌曲进去，还可以在上面玩像纸牌这样的游戏。而且，它自带了十几首歌，你还可以在上面播放视频。所以，没什么大不了的。"

"How much did this cost?" Shinji had asked, worried that his friend had spent too much on someone like him.  
"这东西花了多少钱？" 真嗣问道，担心他的朋友为他这样的人花了太多钱。

"Why the hell does that matter?" Asuka snapped, "Look, you're actually caring about stuff like that? C'mon! Seriously! It's a damn gift! Never mind what it costs!"  
"这他妈有什么关系？" 明日香厉声说道，"听着，你居然在乎这种事？拜托！说真的！这是份该死的礼物！别管它值多少钱！"

Shinji could only stare at her in awe. Even though she had a confident grin on her lips, he knew that, deep down, she had been afraid that Shinji didn't like her present. That, below that harsh exterior, she had asked herself, day after day, would he like it? Would he accept it? "Thank you, Asuka!"  
真嗣只能敬畏地盯着她。尽管她嘴角挂着自信的微笑，但他知道，在她内心深处，她一直担心真嗣不喜欢她的礼物。在那坚硬的外表下，她日复一日地问自己，他会喜欢吗？他会接受吗？“谢谢你，明日香！”

"Hey, seriously, don't mention it."  
“嘿，真的，不用谢。”

As he focused again on the reality before him as he picked up a package of miso, Shinji Ikari focused on a separate memory. He recalled a day after following the nightmare that was Third Impact. It had been a month after Asuka returned that either of them dared to leave the sanctuary of the beach. Why it had taken so long Shinji didn't know. He guessed that, after witnessing the world die before them, they really didn't feel like adventuring the depths of oblivion. Perhaps it was because the sea of LCL had provided for them so well, with crabs and sea creatures right there for eating and the LCL sea there for nutritious life fluids. Additionally, in Asuka's condition, she couldn't move all that far without her organs bleeding within her.  
当他再次专注于眼前的现实，拿起一包味噌时，真嗣·碇专注于另一段记忆。他回忆起在第三次冲击那场噩梦之后的一天。那是明日香回来一个月后，他们才敢离开海滩这个避难所。为什么花了这么长时间，真嗣不知道。他猜想，在目睹世界在他们眼前消亡之后，他们真的不想冒险深入那片虚无。也许是因为 LCL 海洋为他们提供了如此好的生存条件，螃蟹和海洋生物就在那里供他们食用，LCL 海洋则提供了营养丰富的生命之液。此外，以明日香当时的状况，她无法走得太远，否则她的内脏会在体内出血。

Shinji had been constructing a wheelbarrow of sorts to carry the German. He had constructed it from driftwood that had miraculously came to them from the sea about two weeks after Shinji had found Asuka beside him. Having nothing else to do, he whittled the log until it had depth, enough to cradle a human body. The wheel, thankfully, had washed up on shore not long after he found the wood. It was something you'd find on a big wheel bicycle a toddler would use. It wasn't the best sort of barrow, but in this sort of situation, it was the best he had.  
真嗣一直在制作一种独轮车，用来搬运那位德国人。他用的是漂流木，这些木头奇迹般地从海上漂来，大约在真嗣发现明日香躺在他身边的两周后。无所事事之下，他耐心地将木头削成有足够深度的凹槽，足以容纳一个人的身体。幸运的是，车轮不久后也被冲上了岸，看起来像是幼儿使用的大轮自行车上的那种。这不是最好的独轮车，但在这种情况下，这是他能做的最好的了。

"I won't go in that," Asuka had said the moment she saw Shinji's creation, her voice dead and exhausted.  
“我不会坐那个的，”明日香一看到真嗣的作品就立刻说道，声音死气沉沉，疲惫不堪。

"Listen, we're going to have to see if anyone else is here," Shinji had said, surprised by his own sense of bravery. After baring witness to Instrumentality, he had learned to face reality head on. The only way their situation was going to change for the better was if they faced the world head on. Shinji had been surprised that Asuka, who was always so gung-ho and always looking for a solution. She was never this passive, or perhaps hesitant to do anything, before. "You're too injured to walk. The only way we're going to survive is if you get on and I wheel you around."  
"听着，我们得看看这里还有没有其他人，" 真嗣说道，对自己突如其来的勇气感到惊讶。经历了人类补完计划后，他学会了直面现实。只有勇敢面对世界，他们的处境才有可能好转。真嗣对明日香感到意外，她总是那么积极主动，总是寻找解决问题的方法。她以前从未如此被动，或者说犹豫不决。"你伤得太重，走不了路。我们想要活下去，唯一的办法就是你坐上来，我推着你走。"

"I don't care if I die," Asuka replied, in an almost dead voice, "Just leave me alone. I'd rather die than be with you."  
"我不在乎我会不会死，" 明日香几乎用一种死寂的声音回答，"就让我一个人待着吧。我宁愿死也不要和你在一起。"

"Listen! Please! Snap out of it!" Shinji had shouted as he had heaved the German to her feet, hoping she'd stand on her own two feet.  
"听着！求你了！振作起来！" 真嗣喊道，他用力将德国女孩扶起，希望她能自己站起来。

She hadn't. 她没有。

Shinji had caught her before she had hit the floor. With a small grin on her lips, Asuka had asked, in a cold, strangely amused tone, "You mean you don't want me to die?"  
真嗣在她撞到地板前接住了她。阿斯卡嘴角挂着一丝微笑，用一种冰冷而奇怪的语气问道：“你是说，你不想让我死？”

"Why would I want you to die?" Shinji had stammered, now desperate, his eyes starting to tear.  
“我为什么要你死？”真嗣结结巴巴地说，现在他急了，眼睛开始泛泪。

"Why else would you leave me alone to die like that? Why else would you just jerk off on top of me, huh? Why else would you start strangling me the moment I came back to life? I don't want this. I just want to be left alone here, and die. Just let me shrivel up and die."  
"不然你为何要留我一人孤独赴死？为何要在我身上发泄兽欲，嗯？为何我一复活你就立刻掐住我的脖子？我不想要这些。我只想在这里独自死去。就让我枯萎，让我死去。"

"Please don't talk like that."  
"请不要这样说。"

"Why? It makes our poor little bastard Shinji the Hero get all upset? Do you want to cry, huh? Well, face reality: it's your fault I'm like this, why the world's like this! It's all your fault!" She had begun screaming as she slowly pushed herself into a standing position. However, as she continued to shout obscenities at the Third Child, she began to vomit on herself. Torrents of blood exploded from her mouth, dying the sand scarlet. She trembled, falling onto her back, clutching her belly. Tears filled her eyes, tears of pain, tears of fury and anger, tears that shone in the pale moonlight.  
"为什么？难道这会让我们的可怜小混蛋真嗣英雄感到难过吗？你想哭吗，嗯？好吧，面对现实吧：这都是你的错，我变成这样，世界变成这样！都是你的错！"她开始尖叫，同时慢慢站起身来。然而，当她继续对第三适格者破口大骂时，她开始呕吐，鲜血从口中喷涌而出，将沙地染成猩红色。她颤抖着，倒在地上，紧抱着腹部。泪水充满了她的眼眶，那是痛苦的泪水，愤怒的泪水，在苍白的月光下闪烁着。

He was sure, then and there, that she was going to die.  
那一刻，他确信她即将死去。

"Please, don't die! Don't die! I need you. I need you. I can't just live without someone, so please don't leave me alone!" He had fallen to his knees, tears running down his fourteen year old cheeks as he stared down at the broken girl as she coughed again and again, more droplets of ruby splattering against her lips and cheeks.  
“求求你，不要死！不要死！我需要你。我需要你。我不能没有某个人而活，所以请不要留下我一个人！”他跪倒在地，泪水顺着他十四岁的脸颊滑落，他凝视着那个受伤的女孩，她一次又一次地咳嗽，更多的鲜红血滴溅在她的唇边和脸颊上。

"Well, isn't this what you wanted? Me like this? Dummkopf!" she had grunted between coughs, "I hope you like it. I hate you so God d—" Shinji scooped her into his arms. She was surprisingly light, much lighter than he had anticipated, as he dumped her gently into the wheelbarrow. "What're you doing? I told you I'm not—hyakk!" She coughed loudly onto her lap, a large wad of blood splattering against her thighs.  
“这不就是你想要的吗？我变成这样？笨蛋！”她在咳嗽间喘息着，“希望你喜欢。我恨你，该死——”真嗣将她抱入怀中。她出乎意料地轻，比他预想的要轻得多，他轻轻地将她放入手推车里。“你在干什么？我告诉过你我不——咳咳！”她大声咳嗽，一大滩血溅在她的腿上。

Shinji remembered praying that a doctor or surgeon had returned from the sea of LCL, just so that Asuka wouldn't have to die in a make-shift wheelbarrow in the middle of nowhere like this. She didn't deserve to suffer like that, didn't deserve to die such a sad, pathetic death like this.  
真嗣记得自己曾祈祷过有一位医生或外科医生从 LCL 之海归来，只为让明日香不必在这样的荒郊野外，躺在临时拼凑的轮床上死去。她不该遭受这样的痛苦，不该就这样悲惨、可怜地死去。

She didn't deserve to suffer after all she had been through.  
她经历了那么多，实在不该再受苦了。

Shinji Ikari was pulled out of his flashback as the sound of his phone ringing filled the air. He hastily reached into his pocket, and withdrew his cell. "Hello?" he asked, not looking at the caller ID in his haste.  
碇真嗣被手机铃声从回忆中拉回现实。他匆忙伸手进兜里，掏出手机。“喂？”他问道，急切间没顾上看来电显示。

"Shinji! I just heard the good news!"  
"真嗣！我刚听到好消息！"

"Misato?" "美里？"

A cheerful giggle met his ears from the other side of the phone line, a giggle that reminded him of all the times he had spent living at her house when he and Asuka were only fourteen and thirteen years old, respectfully. It reminded him, strangely enough, of a young girl, despite Shinji having, in memory, associated Misato as the closest thing to a mother he ever had. "Well, Asuka called me and told me the whole story. Or at least told me her side of it."  
电话那头传来一阵欢快的笑声，让他想起了那些住在她家时的时光，那时他和明日香分别是十四岁和十三岁。这笑声让他奇怪地想起了一个小女孩，尽管在记忆中，美里是他最接近母亲的存在。“嗯，明日香给我打电话，把整个故事都告诉我了。至少是她那一边的版本。”

"Oh, did she?" "哦，是吗？"

"Yeah, complete with calling you a few creative curse words that my kids have been repeating for the past ten minutes."  
"是啊，还用一些富有创意的脏话骂了你，我孩子们过去十分钟一直在重复这些话。"

"Do you believe her?" "你相信她吗？"

"What kind of a question is that? Of course I don't! I know you too well for that. I'm just surprised you actually managed to, uh, go to home base."  
"这是什么问题？当然没有！我对你太了解了。我只是惊讶你居然真的能，呃，去到本垒。"

"Come again?" “再说一遍？”

"I can't say it with the kids around. Uh, hey!" Misato's voice faded away slightly, as though she were holding the phone a good deal away from her face and talking to her children. "Yumi, take your brother over into the other room, alright? Don't ask why! I'm having an adult conversati—no, you aren't grown up enough to know what it is. Thanks, sweetie." Her voice returned to its ordinary volume. "No, I mean, I never expected you to have sex."  
"有孩子在旁边我不好说。呃，嘿！" 美里声音稍微减弱，仿佛她把电话拿得离脸很远，正对着孩子们说话。"由美，带你弟弟去另一个房间，好吗？别问为什么！我正在和一个成年人交谈——不，你还不够大，不知道这是什么。谢谢，宝贝。" 她的声音恢复了平常的音量。"不，我是说，我从没想过你会发生性关系。"

"Wait, what?!" "等等，什么？！"

"I thought you'd just remain a virgin for the rest of your—"  
"我以为你会一直保持处子之身直到——"

"Misato. Stop now." "美里。现在停下来。"

"Alright, I'm just joking!"  
"好吧，我只是开个玩笑！"

"I hope you were." "我希望你是。"

"But still, what're you going to name the baby?"  
"不过，你打算给孩子起什么名字？"

Shinji considered this. "I haven't really discussed it with Asuka. Actually, I haven't discussed anything with her yet."  
真嗣思考了一下。 "我还没和明日香讨论过。实际上，我还没和她讨论过任何事情。"

"Oh, did she kick you out of the house?"  
"哦，她把你赶出家门了？"

"I haven't even gotten home yet. I'm a little afraid to."  
"我还没到家呢。有点害怕回去。"

"Well, you can't run away from this forever, you know. Best get the worst over with. She'll calm down soon, so don't worry."  
"唉，你总不能一直逃避这个问题。最好尽快面对最糟糕的情况。她很快就会冷静下来的，别担心。"

"Are you sure about that?"  
"你确定吗？"

"Oh, absolutely positive! Asuka isn't the type to keep a grudge."  
"哦，绝对肯定！明日香不是那种记仇的人。"

"Are you sure about that?" Shinji asked, seriously.  
"你确定吗？" 真嗣认真地问道。

"Well, uh…" Misato's voice trailed off, leaving Shinji with the distinct impression she was struggling to buy time. "Oh crap! Ryouji! Stop hitting your sister! I got to go! See ya! Good luck with the preggy!" With that, the line died. Shinji personally doubted that she had any sort of problem with her kids at that moment. For a woman who told him not to run away, she sure was running away when he needed her. What a reliable adult she was.  
"嗯，呃…" 美里的话音渐渐消失，让真嗣明显感觉到她在努力拖延时间。"哦糟了！良治！别打你妹妹！我得挂了！再见！祝你怀孕顺利！" 说完，电话就断了。真嗣个人怀疑她此刻并没有什么孩子的问题。这个告诉他不要逃避的女人，在他需要她的时候却逃得飞快。真是个可靠的大人啊。

After paying for his food, Shinji continued into his car, and drove back home to face the music, to face his destiny. His mp3 player was still playing in his ears as he rode back home, despite a perfectly good car radio and stereo system. All he could think about was that redhead. He tried to remember the last time she was truly furious at him, the last time she had been this angry. When they were younger, they had argued constantly, but, as time went on, these arguments seemed to dwindle. That's not saying they didn't happen frequently, though. For example, just a few months ago they had found themselves arguing about something trivial, something regarding food.  
付完餐费后，真嗣继续坐进车里，驱车回家面对现实，面对他的命运。他的 mp3 播放器仍在耳边播放着音乐，尽管车里有一套完好的车载收音机和音响系统。他满脑子都是那个红发女孩。他试图回忆她上次真正对他发怒是什么时候，上次她这么生气是什么时候。他们年轻时经常争吵，但随着时间的推移，这些争吵似乎逐渐减少。但这并不意味着它们不常发生。比如，就在几个月前，他们还因为一些琐事，关于食物的事情争吵过。

"You know I like my burgers with a little red in them," Asuka had snapped, staring down at the deep brown meet with a disgusted expression.  
"你知道我喜欢汉堡带点血丝的，" 明日香厉声说道，盯着那深褐色的肉，脸上露出厌恶的表情。

"It's healthier when it's thoroughly cooked," Shinji had replied.  
"彻底煮熟了更健康，" 真嗣回答道。

"Yeah, but it's also all dried up! Do you want me eating a dried up burger like this?" she had replied, her tone harsh.  
"是啊，但那样就全干了！你难道想让我吃这种干巴巴的汉堡吗？" 她回敬道，语气尖锐。

"Just put ketchup on it and it won't be dry. Problem sol—"  
"只要加点番茄酱就不干了。问题解决——"

"Doesn't change the fact that the middle is still all brown!" Asuka had interrupted, violently, "I mean, seriously, I think the burgers at McDonalds are better!"  
"中间还是一片棕色的事实并没有改变！" 明日香激烈地打断道，"我是说，认真点，我觉得麦当劳的汉堡都比这个好！"

"Well, you could just order from there. Their burgers are thoroughly brown too, I think."  
"那你完全可以点那家的。我觉得他们的汉堡也是完全棕色的。"

"Yeah, but it's also not really meat! It's some meat substitute they have with a lot of filler in it! And besides, it makes you fat."  
"是啊，但这也不算是真正的肉！这是他们用很多填充物做的肉替代品！而且，它会让你发胖。"

"You seem to eat it enough on your way to work," Shinji replied.  
"你上班路上似乎吃得够多了，" 真嗣回答道。"

At that moment, the German had jumped to her feet, crushing her burger underneath her fist as she slammed her knuckles down against the table. "Are you implying something!?"  
就在那一刻，那位德国人猛地站起身来，拳头下的汉堡被压得粉碎，她用指关节重重地敲击着桌子。"你在暗示什么吗！？"

"Implying what?" "暗示什么？"

"Dummkopf! You think I'm a damn porker, don't you!?" she had snapped, her face scarlet.  
""笨蛋！你以为我是头该死的肥猪，对吧！？"" 她厉声说道，脸涨得通红。

"Who ever said that?" Shinji had laughed in disbelief. Fat? Asuka was a stick. Her breasts probably contained more fat than the rest of her body combined, sure, but otherwise she was stick. Slender, svelte. When they were younger, there were even times Shinji wondered if she was too thin. In any case, the sheer idea that Shinji could even think, for a second, that she was fat was downright absurd!  
""谁说的？"" 真嗣难以置信地笑了起来。胖？明日香瘦得像根棍子。她的胸部可能比身体的其他部分加起来还要多脂肪，当然，但除此之外她就是根棍子。苗条，纤细。在他们还小的时候，真嗣甚至有几次怀疑她是不是太瘦了。无论如何，真嗣竟然会有一瞬间认为她胖，这想法简直荒谬至极！

"Don't you laugh at me! I—" A moment had passed where Asuka considered all that she had just said. More blush ran up her cheeks as she muttered, in a soft tone, "I'm doing it again, aren't I?"  
"别笑话我！我——" 阿斯卡停顿了一会儿，思索着她刚刚所说的一切。她的脸颊上泛起了更多的红晕，她轻声嘀咕道，"我又在这样了，对吧？"

"Doing what?" "在做什么？"

The redhead had lowered herself into her seat, running a hand up her hair. "I'm just blowing things out of proportion like I always do. Say it. I know I'm right."  
红发女孩坐回了自己的座位，用手梳理着头发。"我只是像往常一样夸大其词。说吧，我知道我是对的。"

"Well, yeah, you are," Shinji replied.  
"嗯，是的，你是，" 真嗣回答道。

She had sighed again at this, holding her head in both hands. "I'm just a wreck, aren't I? I'm never going to change. I'll still be just as much of a bitch as I was when I was a kid."  
她再次叹了口气，双手抱头。"我只是个废物，对吧？我永远不会改变。我还是会像小时候那样是个婊子。"

"Huh? What're you talking about?" Shinji had asked, confused.  
"啊？你在说什么？" 真嗣困惑地问。

"Do you know what I heard some people saying at work? They were talking about me behind my back! I heard them, you know. They were chatting away about that German girl who has trouble reading Kanji or that German bitch who was a pilot or that German bitch who thinks she's so hot."  
"你知道我在工作中听到一些人在说什么吗？他们在背后议论我！我听到了，你知道的。他们在闲聊那个德语女孩汉字读不好，或者那个德国婊子是个飞行员，还是那个德国婊子自以为很了不起。"

"Who's been saying that?" Shinji had asked, critically.  
"谁在说这些？" 真嗣追问道，语气中带着质疑。

"A bunch of the girls who work there."  
"就是那里的几个女同事。"

"Do you know any of them."  
"你认识他们中的任何一个吗？"

"I don't know," she had replied, rising to her feet, "I shouldn't let it bother me, though. I'm better than that. I've grown up. I'm not a kid. I'm not a kid. I'm not a kid. I'm not a kid. I'm not—"  
"我不知道，" 她回答道，站起身来，"不过我不应该让它困扰我。我比那更好。我已经长大了。我不是个孩子。我不是个孩子。我不是个孩子。我不是个孩子。我不是——"

"You know, if someone hurts you, it's not immature not to feel a little insulted," Shinji had said, frowning, "In fact, I think it's kinda natural to feel something."  
"你知道，如果有人伤害了你，感到有点受辱并不是不成熟，" 真嗣皱着眉说，"事实上，我觉得有点感觉是很自然的。"

"But I don't like it," Asuka had replied, frowning as well, "I mean, why me?"  
“但我并不喜欢这样，”明日香也皱着眉头回答，“我是说，为什么是我？”

Why me indeed. As Shinji approached the door to his apartment complex, his bags in hand and his spirits tentative, he paused a moment to remove his mp3 player, ready to face reality. As he drew nearer to the door, he mumbled under his breath the mantra that he had recited over and over again throughout the course of his life: "I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away." He recited it again and again as he rang the doorbell with his elbow, unable to reach the button with his hands, laden with bags.  
为什么是我，确实。当真嗣走近他的公寓楼大门时，手里提着行李，心情忐忑不安，他停了一会儿，取下他的 mp3 播放器，准备面对现实。当他走近门口时，他低声念叨着一生中反复背诵的咒语：“我不能逃跑。我不能逃跑。我不能逃跑。”他一遍又一遍地重复着，用肘部按响了门铃，因为双手提着行李，无法用手指触碰按钮。

The door slid open to reveal the German girl. Just laying eyes on Asuka sent a jolt through Shinji's body. There she was, ready to beat him to a pulp, ready to shout and scream at him, ready to call him an idiot and remind him that it was his fault, not Asuka the girl who crawled into his be naked, that she had a baby growing inside of her. He flinched at first, instinctively, upon laying eyes on her flaming red hair. A second or two past before Shinji lowered his arms, only to meet his fiancé's eyes. They were puffy, but not tear laden. It was as though she had cried hours before, and the residual effects had yet to wear off. Cautiously, Shinji murmured, "I'm home," before walking anxiously past his fiancé into the kitchen. As he dropped the bags onto the kitchen table, he heard the door slide shut behind him. This was it. Asuka was going to pummel him now. She was going to shout now that the door was closed and the world couldn't see her ugly side.  
门滑开了，露出那个德国女孩。仅仅看到明日香就让真嗣的身体一阵颤抖。她就在那里，准备把他揍得鼻青脸肿，准备对他大喊大叫，准备骂他是个白痴并提醒他，是她怀了孩子，而不是那个赤裸着爬进他床上的明日香。他一开始本能地退缩了一下，看到她那火红的头发时。一两秒钟过去，真嗣才放下手臂，与他的未婚妻对视。她的眼睛肿胀，但没有泪光。仿佛她几小时前哭过，而残留的影响还未消退。小心翼翼地，真嗣低声说：“我回来了。”然后紧张地从未婚妻身边走过，进入厨房。当他把袋子放在厨房桌上时，听到身后的门滑上了。就是这样。明日香现在要揍他了。她要关门后大喊大叫，让世界看不到她的丑陋一面。

"Asuka, I'm sor—" “明日香，我很抱歉——”

"Don't apologize," Asuka replied, "Don't worry about it. I should be the one saying sorry."  
“别道歉，”明日香回答，“别担心。我才是该说对不起的那个人。”

"Huh?" This was a tad different than what he had been expecting. He had thought at least one piece of furnature would be overturned, a few shouting matches, and at least fifty verbal punches matched with fifty real ones. He didn't expect her to just admit defeat so easily. He watched as Asuka fell into a couch, her hands resting on her torso. She glanced up at Shinji, a frown o her lips.  
"啊？" 这和他预想的情况有些出入。他本以为至少会有家具被掀翻，几次争吵，以及至少五十句言语攻击配上五十次实际的冲突。他没想到她会这么轻易地承认失败。他看着明日香跌坐在沙发上，双手放在腹部。她抬头看向真嗣，嘴角带着一丝不悦。

"I'm sorry. I said it, alright? Isn't that good enough?"  
"对不起。我说了，行了吧？这样还不够吗？"

"What do you—" "你这是——"

"You didn't do anything wrong, I should've been taking the pill, all that stuff, alright?" Asuka said, her tone mildly frustrated, "Jesus! How many times do I have to say this again?" Her voice cracked mildly toward the end, but her resolve was strong. Her eyes were growing slightly more moist as the seconds past, but her heart didn't waver. She stared at Shinji with a deep resolve, as though she were hoping, praying, that her eyes relayed the message deep inside of her: she was sorry. She was wrong.  
"你没做错什么，我本该吃药的，所有那些事，对吧？" 明日香说道，语气中带着些许懊恼，"天哪！我得说多少遍才行？" 她的声音在结尾处略显沙哑，但她的决心坚定。随着时间的流逝，她的眼眶微微湿润，但她的心意并未动摇。她凝视着真嗣，眼神中充满了深切的决心，仿佛在期待、祈祷她的眼神能传达出她内心深处的信息：她很抱歉。她错了。

She admitted defeat. 她承认了失败。

Shinji sighed in relief. "You know, for a moment, I was afraid you were going to kill me."  
真嗣松了一口气。"你知道吗，有那么一刻，我还以为你要杀了我呢。"

"I'd rather not have my baby girl not have a father," Asuka replied.  
"我宁愿不让我的宝贝女儿没有父亲，"明日香回答道。

"Wait, who said it was a girl? It could be a boy."  
"等等，谁说是个女孩？也可能是男孩。"

"Yes, but it could also be a girl!"  
"是的，但也可能是个女孩！"

"Are we fighting again?" "我们又吵起来了？"

"We damn sure are fighting! I say it's a girl!"  
"我们肯定是在吵架！我说是个女孩！"

"It doesn't even have a gender yet, does it?"  
"它甚至还没有性别，对吧？"

"You know, I honestly don't think so yet."  
"你知道吗，老实说，我还没这么想。"

"We'll have more than enough time to realize if it's a boy or a girl, so don't worry about that," Shinji replied, frowning tensely.  
"我们有足够的时间来确认是男孩还是女孩，所以别担心这个，" 真嗣回答道，眉头紧锁。"

"Alright, I guess so," Asuka replied, rising to her feet, her hands on her stomach, "I'm just bummed that I need to gain weight for this thing! That's going to suck!"  
"好吧，我想也是，" 明日香回答，站起身来，双手放在肚子上，"我只是有点郁闷，为了这小家伙我还得增重！那可真糟糕！"

"You're skinny enough as it is. I doubt even twenty extra pounds would—"  
"你已经够瘦了。我怀疑就算再长二十磅——"

"Twenty!? Who'd say I'd gain that much!?" Asuka's eyes were wide, as though Shinji had just informed her she was dying of terminal cancer. Shinji was mildly surprised by this reaction. You'd think that she'd know about this sort of thing seeing as how she graduated from a German university at the age of 13 AND was a girl.  
"二十磅！？谁说我能长那么多！？" 明日香瞪大了眼睛，仿佛真嗣刚刚告诉她得了晚期癌症。真嗣对这种反应感到有些惊讶。按理说她应该知道这些，毕竟她 13 岁就从德国大学毕业了，而且还是个女孩子。

"I thought everyone knew about—"  
"我以为大家都知道——"

"Don't give me that bull! Well, if I am gaining weight for YOUR child, make me dinner. Now."  
"别跟我来这套！好吧，如果我是因为你的孩子才变胖的，那就给我做饭吧。现在。"

"You're saying that as though I never cook dinner."  
"你这么说好像我从不做饭似的。"

"Yeah? So?" Asuka asked, in a rather harsh tone.  
"是吗？那又怎样？" 明日香问道，语气颇为尖锐。

"Alright, my majesty," Shinji said in a sarcastic tone.  
“好的，我的陛下，”真嗣带着讽刺的语气说道。

#

The stupid idiot was sleeping in bed next to her, but Asuka Langley Sohryu hadn't slept a wink yet. Her hand rested on her torso, absentmindedly adjusting the cloth around her belly. She knew that the baby hadn't even begun to develop yet, but she could almost feel the rug rat kicking. It was strange. Maybe it was a sensation brought up by paranoia, or stress. It was like being next to a sick person and developing a sore throat.  
那个愚蠢的白痴就睡在她旁边的床上，但惣流·明日香·兰格雷还没合过眼。她的手放在腹部，心不在焉地调整着缠绕在肚子上的布料。她知道宝宝甚至还没有开始发育，但她几乎能感觉到那小家伙在踢腿。这很奇怪。也许这是由偏执或压力引起的错觉，就像身边有个病人自己也会喉咙痛一样。

Still, she couldn't imagine herself being a mother. She didn't know the first thing about taking care of a child. What was she going to do? Feed it? Give it a nice, hospitable environment to live in? She could ask her stepmom, but she didn't want to really see her face right now. She knew she had to go back to Germany soon, though, if she was pregnant. Her family had the right to know.  
尽管如此，她无法想象自己成为一个母亲。她对照顾孩子一无所知。她该怎么办？喂它？给它一个舒适宜居的环境生活？她可以问她的继母，但她现在真的不想见到她的脸。她知道如果怀孕了，她很快就得回德国去。她的家人有权知道这件事。

Still, whenever she thought of Germany, the same memory returned to her mind's eye: the image of a doll dangling from a noose next to a limp human corpse, hanging from a similar noose, drifting back and forth, like a pendulum, dead, high above her head, high above the head of her child avatar. She cringed as the memory remained stuck in her brain. It wouldn't go away. It wasn't going away! The damn doll and the damn noose in that damned house! Damn them! Damn them! Damn them all!  
然而，每当她想起德国，同样的记忆就会浮现在她的脑海中：一个玩偶悬挂在绳套上，旁边是一具软绵绵的人类尸体，同样挂在类似的绳套上，来回摆动，像钟摆一样，死气沉沉，高高悬在她的头顶，悬在她孩子化身的头顶。她皱着眉头，记忆如影随形，挥之不去。它不会消失！那个该死的玩偶和该死的绳套在那该死的房子里！该死！该死！该死他们所有人！

She felt a tear roll down her cheek, a tear she brushed away aggressively. She wasn't a kid anymore! She couldn't just cry like that whenever something sad happened. She needed to be strong, stronger than anyone else. She had to be for her daughter—child. She couldn't become caught up in suffering, in the pain of memories of ancient history.  
她感到一滴泪珠滑过脸颊，她用力擦去。她不再是孩子了！不能每次遇到伤心事就那样哭。她需要坚强，比任何人都坚强。为了她的女儿——孩子，她必须如此。她不能沉溺于痛苦，不能被古老记忆的伤痛所困。

Memories of her mother. 关于她母亲的记忆。

**Part 5 第五部分**

"So when's your belly gonna get big?"  
“所以你的肚子什么时候会变大？”

"Shut up!" "闭嘴！"

"My mommy's got big when she had Ryouji."  
"我妈妈生龙二的时候肚子变得好大。"

"Misato, why do we have to baby sit for you right now?" Shinji asked, turning away from Asuka, who was beat red in the face as little Yumi queried her, curiously.  
""美里，为什么我们现在得帮你照顾小孩？"" 真嗣问道，转过身去，只见明日香满脸通红，小优美好奇地向她提问。

Misato, who was currently red in the face as she stared at Yumi asking rather awkward questions to the now pregnant Asuka, replied, with a note of laughter in her voice, "Well, I told you on the phone. Makoto and I need to go to that dinner. The higher ups are going. Fuyutsuki really is working us to the bone." Turning away from Shinji, Misato hastily approached her inquisitive daughter. She was a small little girl, 7 years of age, with a small body, the pudginess of youth still fresh in her body, despite now she'd grown a good deal. She inherited her mother's hair, but needed to wear glasses just like her father. As her mother bent down on a single knee to see her eye-to-eye, Yumi pressed her knuckles anxiously against her lip. "Now, sweetie, look, you can't just ask people like that. They may be, uh, a little sensitive."  
美里此刻满脸通红，她盯着由美，后者正向怀孕中的明日香提出一些颇为尴尬的问题。她带着一丝笑意回答道：“哎，我在电话里不是跟你说了嘛。真琴和我得去参加那个晚宴。高层们都会出席。副司令真是把我们当牛做马了。”美里转身避开真嗣，快步走向她那好奇的女儿。由美是个七岁的小女孩，身材娇小，童年的圆润尚未完全褪去，尽管她已经长高了不少。她继承了母亲的头发，但需要戴眼镜，就像她父亲一样。当母亲单膝跪地与她平视时，由美紧张地用指关节抵住嘴唇。“听着，宝贝，你不能这样随便问别人。他们可能会，呃，有点敏感。”

"What do you mean?" Yumi asked with wide, watery eyes.  
“你是什么意思？”由美睁大水汪汪的眼睛问道。

"I mean, some people are a little sensitive about things like the size of their bellies," Misato replied, trying to be tactful.  
“我是说，有些人对肚子大小这类事情比较敏感，”美里尽量委婉地回答。

"But she isn't really any different from last time," Yumi replied, gesturing towards Asuka, who's torso was indeed nearly as flat as it was last time they had seen her. The only reason Shinji saw any difference at all in Asuka's anatomy was because they were living together. That was it. It was a very subtle change he could only see when she was naked, which was very infrequent to say the least. It was mostly that her abdominal muscles had sort of faded away, or were pushed outward ever so slightly.  
"“但她其实和上次没什么不同，”优米回答道，指着明日香，她的躯干确实和上次见面时一样平坦。真嗣之所以能察觉明日香身体上的任何变化，仅仅因为他们同居了。仅此而已。这是一个非常细微的变化，他只能在明日香裸体时才能看到，这种情况至少可以说是非常少见。主要是因为她的腹肌似乎有些消退，或者说是微微向外推移。”

"Yeah, well, I should be getting used to it," she had replied when Shinji had brought the subject up, "You know, it's weird. I'm a little worried about how my body's going to change, but somehow—WAIT A SECOND! Are you calling me fat or something? Dummkopf!"  
"“是啊，好吧，我应该习惯了，”当真嗣提起这个话题时，她回答道，“你知道，这很奇怪。我对身体的变化有点担心，但不知怎么的——等等！你是在说我胖吗？笨蛋！”

Needless to say, Shinji doubted he'd be bringing up any developments on Asuka's—er—developments.  
"不用说，真嗣怀疑自己不会再提起明日香——呃——身体上的任何变化了。”

"Just don't bring it up, Yumi. Just be a good girl. Aunt Asuka is, well, not all that used to being a mother." Misato rose to her feet after giving her daughter a tight, brief hug, only to turn toward both Shinji and Asuka. "Look, think of it as a learning experience. I mean, think about it: you're going to be raising a baby soon. This is just a warm up act. Ryouji—where's Ryouji?"  
"就别提这事了，Yumi。乖乖听话就好。Asuka 阿姨嘛，嗯，不太习惯当妈妈。" Misato 紧紧地抱了一下女儿，然后站起身，转向 Shinji 和 Asuka。"听着，就当是学习经验吧。我是说，想想看：你们很快就要养育一个宝宝了。这不过是热身罢了。Ryouji——Ryouji 在哪儿？"

Shinji glanced over his shoulder to see five-year-old Ryouji staring at the TV, transfixed by the images on the screen, in awe. He was watching some sort of program that clearly wasn't entirely age appropriate for him. Shinji wondered, absentmindedly, whether or not Misato had let him see this kind of stuff at their house, because neither Misato nor Yumi really reacted to seeing Ryouji watching a brutal action movie. Asuka glanced over him, and drew nearer to him, sitting cross-legged beside him, staring at the glowing screen. She reached for a bag of potato chips, only to rip it open. She picked a few chips from the bag, only to offer a few to Ryouji.  
Shinji 回头一看，只见五岁的 Ryouji 正盯着电视，被屏幕上的画面深深吸引，满是敬畏。他在看某种显然不太适合他年龄的节目。Shinji 心不在焉地想，不知道 Misato 是否让他们家的小孩看这类东西，因为无论是 Misato 还是 Yumi，看到 Ryouji 在看一部残酷的动作片时都没有什么反应。Asuka 瞥了他一眼，然后靠近他，盘腿坐在他旁边，盯着发光的屏幕。她伸手去拿一袋薯片，撕开包装，从袋子里抓了几片，顺手递给 Ryouji 几片。

"Well, it looks like they're getting along well," Misato replied, mildly relieved, "Well, I gotta go!"  
"看来他们相处得不错，" Misato 略感宽慰地回答，"好了，我得走了！"

"Mommy! Can I have a kiss good-bye?" Yumi replied. Ryouji offered no such sentiment, completely consumed by the program.  
"妈妈！我可以得到一个告别吻吗？" 由美回答道。良治对此毫无表示，完全沉浸在程序中。

"Okay." Misato hastily leaned in, kissed her daughter's forehead, only to dart out of the apartment, running for her car, eager to dart off to that dinner so she wouldn't need to be late. She left Shinji and Asuka alone with two children. It was only when the responsibility was fully deposited on Shinji that he panicked.  
"好的。" 美里匆忙俯身，亲吻了女儿的额头，随即冲出公寓，奔向她的车，急切地想要赶去那顿晚餐，以免迟到。她留下真嗣和明日香独自照顾两个孩子。直到责任完全落在真嗣身上，他才开始慌张。

Watching Misato's children? What a crazy idea! He didn't know how to raise them! He didn't know the first thing about raising a child, but maybe that was the point. He'd just need to get to know them, that was all. How hard could it possibly be. "I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away. I mustn't—"  
看着美里的孩子？多么疯狂的想法！他不知道如何抚养他们！他对抚养孩子一无所知，但也许这就是重点。他只需要了解他们，仅此而已。这能有多难。 "我不能逃跑。我不能逃跑。我不能——"

"What're you doing, Uncle Shinji?" Yumi asked, curiously.  
"你在做什么，真嗣叔叔？" 由美好奇地问道。

"Huh? Nothing, don't worry." Turning to Yumi, anxious grimace on his face, he asked, curiously, "Well, what do you guys like to eat?"  
"嗯？没什么，别担心。" 他转向由美，脸上带着焦虑的苦笑，好奇地问，"那么，你们喜欢吃什么呢？"

"I want miso soup," Ryouji called from the TV, not turning around.  
"我要味噌汤，" 亮司从电视那边喊道，没有回头。

"Don't listen to him!" Yumi replied, "He doesn't know what he wants. Can you make some riceballs?"  
"别听他的！" 由美回答，"他根本不知道自己想要什么。你能做些饭团吗？"

"Miso soup!" Ryouji shouted, turning around to face Yumi.  
"味噌汤！" 亮司喊道，转身面对由美。"

"Miso stinks! Riceballs are better!"  
"味噌臭死了！饭团更好！"

"Miso!" "味噌！"

"Rice!" "米饭！"

"Miso!" "味噌！"

"Rice!" "米饭！"

"Why does this look so familiar?" Asuka asked, curiously.  
"为什么这看起来这么眼熟？" 明日香好奇地问道。

"Don't know," Shinji replied, "I usually don't fight back, and when I do, you usually hit me."  
"不知道，" 真嗣回答，"我通常不还手，而我一还手，你通常就会打我。"

"Good point." "说得好。"

"Miso!" "味噌！"

"Rice!" "米饭！"

"Miso!" "味噌！"

"Rice!" "米饭！"

"Shouldn't we be doing something to break them up?" Shinji asked.  
"我们不应该做点什么来阻止他们吗？" 真嗣问道。

"Yeah, I know! Make some German food!" Asuka declared.  
“耶，我知道了！做些德国菜吧！”明日香宣布道。

"What?" Both Yumi and Ryouji turned toward the red head, curiously, "What's German food?"  
“什么？”优米和凌二都好奇地转向红发女孩，“德国菜是什么？”

"Mein Gott! You don't know what German food is?" Asuka asked, a sly smile on her lips, "Well, that's okay. Shinji, make it."  
“我的天哪！你们不知道德国菜是什么？”明日香问道，嘴角带着一丝狡黠的微笑，“好吧，没关系。真嗣，你来做。”

"What? What do you want me to make?"  
"什么？你想让我做什么？"

Blushing, Asuka turned to Shinji, and loudly whispered into his ear, hastily. "I don't know! Just make something! Make Wiener Schnitzel. We have the ingrediants for that, right?"  
脸红的明日香转向真嗣，急忙凑到他耳边大声耳语道：“我不知道！随便做点什么吧！做维也纳炸肉排。我们有做那个的材料，对吧？”

"Yeah, I think so." "嗯，我想是的。"

"Well, get on it! I'm hungry!" Asuka whispered.  
“快点动手吧！我饿了！”明日香低声催促道。

"Wait, aren't we making this for the kids?" Shinji asked, glancing at the German through narrowed eyes.  
“等等，我们不是在做给孩子们吃的吗？”真嗣眯起眼睛，瞥了一眼德国人问道。

"Yeah! That's right. The kids. Right." Asuka pulled away, and turned toward the kids. "Hey, I have a question for you. You guys wanna play a video game?"  
“对啊！没错。孩子们。对。”明日香退开一步，转向孩子们。“嘿，我问你们个问题。你们想玩电子游戏吗？”

"What kind of game?" Ryouji asked, eagerly.  
"什么游戏？" 亮司问，急切地。

"I don't like those games," Yumi replied, anxiously pushing up her glasses.  
"我不喜欢那些游戏，" 由美回答，焦虑地推了推眼镜。

"What? Afraid you can't beat me?" Asuka replied, a sneer on her lips.  
"什么？怕赢不了我？" 明日香回答，嘴角带着一丝嘲讽。

"No I'm not!" Yumi insisted, balling up her hands into pudgy fists.  
"不，我没有！" 由美坚持道，将她的小手握成胖乎乎的拳头。

"Oh really? Then play!" "哦，真的吗？那就来吧！"

"I will!" "我会来的！"

As Shinji made the German food, which really wasn't all that hard to do considering it was mostly a fried dish, she glanced over at Asuka as she played her game. Even though she was behaving much like a child herself, the children were having fun with her. She knew how to let them have a good time, knew what to say, even though it sometimes was a little mean. He knew, right then and there, that she was ready to be a mom. She would make an amazing mother for his son—er, child.  
当真嗣做着德国菜时，考虑到这主要是一道炸食，其实并不难做，她瞥了一眼正在玩游戏的明日香。尽管她自己表现得就像个孩子，但孩子们和她在一起玩得很开心。她知道如何让他们玩得尽兴，知道该说什么，尽管有时有点刻薄。他当时就明白，她已经准备好成为一个母亲了。她会成为他儿子——呃，孩子的出色母亲。

But would he really make all that good of a father?  
但他真的会成为一个好父亲吗？

"Shinji, for a Japanese person, you can at least cook decent German food," Asuka said, sampling the plate of fried food with an almost nostalgic glint in her eyes, "I've trained you well."  
“真嗣，作为一个日本人，你至少能做出像样的德国菜。”明日香说着，品尝着那盘炸食，眼中闪过一丝怀旧的光芒，“我把你训练得不错。”

"Trained? All you did was buy me a German cook book and told you to make German stuff. You didn't train me at all," Shinji replied, his eyes narrowed.  
"训练？你不过是给我买了本德国烹饪书，然后让我做德国菜。你根本没训练我，" 真嗣回答道，眼睛眯了起来。

"It's the same difference."  
"其实差不多。"

"This isn't half-bad," Ryouji replied as he nibbled on some of the dish.  
"这还不赖嘛，" 良治边说边尝了几口菜。

"It's too fried," Yumi replied, disgusted, "I still want rice balls!"  
"太油腻了，" 优米回答，一脸厌恶，"我还是想吃饭团！"

"German food beats rice balls," replied Asuka, simply, with an amused grin, but not one without a hint of malice, "If you want rice balls that badly, I'm sure the invincible iron chef Shinji could make you some."  
"德国菜可比饭团强多了，" 明日香简单地回答，带着一丝戏谑的笑意，但也不乏一丝恶意，"如果你那么想吃饭团，我相信无敌的铁厨真嗣肯定能给你做几个。"

"It wouldn't be a problem," Shinji replied, smiling.  
"那不成问题，" 真嗣微笑着回答。"

"Ah! So the invincible Shinji rises up to the challenge of making rice balls for a little girl," Asuka said, making Yumi giggle slightly, "I guess he can do just about anything! Even cook decent German food without a drop of that great blood in his system."  
"啊！看来无敌的 Shinji 要挑战为小女孩做饭团了，" Asuka 说道，逗得 Yumi 轻声笑了起来，"看来他无所不能！甚至能在没有那伟大血统的情况下做出像样的德国菜。"

"Great blood?" Shinji replied, finishing his meal, which he had to say was too fried, wasn't his taste, and he would probably make rice balls for himself to get the lousy taste out of his mouth, "I don't know about that."  
"伟大血统？" Shinji 回答道，结束了他的晚餐，他不得不说这顿饭太油腻了，不合他的口味，他可能会为自己做些饭团来去除嘴里的糟糕味道，"我不太确定。"

"Germany is the greatest nation in the world," Asuka proclaimed, "And don't you forget it, dummkopf!"  
"德国是世界上最伟大的国家，" Asuka 宣称，"你可别忘了，笨蛋！"

"Speaking of Germany, have you called your parents yet about you're, uh, pregnancy?" Shinji asked as he withdrew the rice cooker from a cabinet.  
"说到德国，你给父母打电话了吗？关于你，呃，怀孕的事？" 真嗣一边问，一边从橱柜里拿出电饭煲。

"Oh, my parents?" Shinji glanced over at his fiancé. Her eyes glanced down at her dish as she ran her hands through her hair, averting her gaze from anyone's eyes. "I actually, uh, haven't even told them we were engaged yet."  
"哦，我父母？" 真嗣瞥了一眼他的未婚妻。她的目光落在自己的盘子上，双手梳理着头发，避开了所有人的视线。"其实，呃，我还没告诉他们我们订婚了。"

"You haven't?" Shinji stammered. That entire time Shinji had asked Asuka if she had asked her parents if they were going to be at the wedding, and yet, all this time, she hadn't. There had to be a reason, just had to be, why she wouldn't inform her own family of such an important occasion.  
"你还没说？" 真嗣结巴道。这段时间里，他一直问明日香是否已经告诉她父母他们要结婚的事，然而，她却一直没说。一定有什么原因，一定有，为什么她不告诉自己的家人这么重要的时刻。

"Yeah, uh, sorry?" "嗯，呃，抱歉？"

"Don't worry about it. When are you going to tell them? They do deserve to know."  
"别担心。你打算什么时候告诉他们？他们确实有权知道。"

"I'll call 'em eventually. Sooner than later. Maybe." Once again, she averted her gaze.  
""我迟早会打电话给他们的。尽快吧。也许。"" 她再次移开了视线。

"You can't run away from this," Shinji replied.  
"你逃不掉的，" 真嗣回答道。

"Coming from you, Mr. 'I Mustn't Run Away', I don't think you're in any position to be telling me that," Asuka replied, snidely, but not harshly.  
"从你这位'我不能逃跑'先生嘴里说出来，我觉得你没资格这么说我，" 明日香尖刻地回应，但并不严厉。

"But I mean, you rarely mention your parents, but I'm sure they miss you," Shinji said, smiling, "I mean, they can't be anything like my father was." Upon stating that, the words "my father," an image emerged in Shinji's brain. An image of himself, years from now, having grown a chin-strap beard like his father, staring down at his future son, a weedy awkward youngster much like he had been, huddled in a corner as he, Shinji, reprimanded him, speaking in Shinji's voice but in an uncharacteristically harsh tone, a cruel tone that sounded like a man by the name of Gendo Ikari. Shinji ran a hand through his hair as he pulled out the bag of rice, scooping enough rice for two people, and Asuka because he knew she'd want some, along with some for Ryouji in case he was jealous of his elder sister.  
"但我的意思是，你很少提到你的父母，但我确信他们想念你，" 真嗣微笑着说，"我是说，他们不可能像我父亲那样。" 说到这里，"我父亲"这几个字在真嗣脑海中浮现出一个画面。画面中的自己，多年以后，留着像他父亲那样的下巴胡须，低头看着未来的儿子，一个瘦弱笨拙的少年，就像他曾经那样，蜷缩在角落里，而真嗣自己则在训斥他，用真嗣的声音却带着一种异常严厉的语气，一种残酷的语气，听起来像是叫源堂·碇的男人。真嗣用手梳理了一下头发，拿出米袋，舀了足够两人份的米，还有明日香的份，以及一些给凌二，以防他嫉妒他的姐姐。

Asuka didn't seem to notice Shinji's stress. "Yeah, well, I guess you're right. Still, I'm not sure how happy I'd be if my stepmom started to act like she really cared if I was getting married or not."  
明日香似乎没有注意到真嗣的压力。“嗯，好吧，我想你是对的。不过，我不确定如果我的继母开始表现得好像真的很在意我是否结婚，我会感到多高兴。”

"She cares," Yumi declared, balling up her fists passionately, "Mothers always care about stuff like that!"  
“她关心，”优米坚定地握紧拳头，充满激情地说，“母亲总是关心这类事情的！”

Frowning slightly, Asuka replied, "I don't know about that."  
明日香微微皱眉，回答道：“我不太确定这一点。”

"Besides, what's a stepmom?" Ryouji asked.  
"再说了，什么是继母？" 龙二问道。

Asuka was about to answer when Yumi interrupted her. "Don't you know anything? A stepmommy is a mommy you have after your real mommy goes away! A girl in my class has a stepmommy."  
明日香正要回答，却被由美打断了。"你什么都不懂吗？继母就是当你亲生妈妈离开后，你有的新妈妈！我班上有个女孩就有个继母。"

"You mean mommy's going to leave me?" Ryouji stammered, tears in his eyes.  
"你是说妈妈要离开我吗？" 龙二结结巴巴地说，眼里含着泪水。

Neither Shinji or Asuka responded.  
无论是真嗣还是明日香都没有回应。

"Of course she isn't, silly!" Yumi replied, reproachfully, "Mommy isn't going anywhere. It's just what happens if you get a divorce, that's all. And your mommy doesn't leave you, really. She just lives somewhere else. My friend at school sees her mommy all the time—"  
"当然不会，傻瓜！" 由美反驳道，"妈妈哪儿也不会去。只是离婚了就会这样，仅此而已。而且你妈妈并没有离开你，真的。她只是住在别的地方。我学校的朋友就经常见到她妈妈——"

"Can we please change the subject?"  
"我们能换个话题吗？"

Shinji glanced over at his fiancé to see a sight he had never, in all his years, expected to see out of the blue like this. Asuka's head was slumped over, her face almost completely covered by the shadows of her bangs. A small moist gasp for air escaped her throat as a small, beady tear rolled down the strong German's cheek. Shinji could only stare in shock as she brushed the tear aside with her knuckle, only for a second tear to replace the first. What was wrong with her? Just talking about mothers brought her to tears? Just what the hell happened to Asuka's mother? Was she involved in a bitter divorce? Was her mother arrested for drug abuse? Did she die? The truth was that Asuka had never, in all the years she knew her, mentioned the status of her real mother. Occasionally, and by occasionally she meant rarely, she'd mention her family in Germany, but never would she mention her real mother.  
真嗣瞥了一眼他的未婚妻，看到了一幅他多年来从未预料到会突然出现的景象。明日香的头低垂着，她的脸几乎完全被刘海的阴影遮住。她喉咙里发出一声微弱的湿润喘息，一颗小泪珠从这位坚强的德国女孩的脸颊上滚落。真嗣只能震惊地看着她用指节擦去泪水，随即第二颗泪珠又取而代之。她怎么了？仅仅谈论母亲就让她流泪了吗？明日香的妈妈到底发生了什么？她是否卷入了痛苦的离婚？她的母亲是否因吸毒被捕？她去世了吗？事实是，明日香从未在她所知的这些年里提及过她亲生母亲的情况。偶尔，她指的是极少的时候，她会提到她在德国的家人，但绝不会提及她的亲生母亲。

Except for the immediate aftermath of Third Impact.  
除了第三次冲击刚发生后的那段时间。

He approached his fiancé, and put a comforting hand on her shoulder. She glanced up. Her sky blue eyes were filled with tears she struggled to hold back, her stiff upper lip struggling against quivering sobs. Her face was contorted as it fought the war against crying, against showing her true feelings. As Shinji bent down to embrace her, the proud German continued to resist the tears. Even as she buried her face into spot between his shoulder and chest, she chose to whip the tears that had yet to fall against Shinji's shirt rather than let them slip down her face.  
他走向未婚妻，轻轻地将手放在她的肩上。她抬头望向他，天蓝色的眼眸中盈满了泪水，她努力抑制着不让它们落下，紧绷的嘴唇与颤抖的呜咽抗争。她的脸因与哭泣的斗争而扭曲，努力不显露真实的情感。当真嗣弯腰拥抱她时，这位骄傲的德国女孩仍在抗拒泪水。即使她将脸埋在他肩与胸之间的位置，她选择将尚未滑落的泪水甩在他的衬衫上，而不是让它们顺着脸颊流淌。

"You stupid idiot," Asuka mumbled, her words interrupted for a brief second by an uncontrolled sob, a sob she struggled to quench.  
“你这个笨蛋，”明日香喃喃道，话音被一个无法控制的呜咽打断了一瞬，她努力压制着这个呜咽。

"Aunt Asuka? Are you okay?" Yumi asked, concerned. She put a back on her "aunt's" back. Ryouji too took a closer look, a glint of fear in his eyes for her safety. Slowly, she rose out from her position, with muted sobs.  
“明日香阿姨？你还好吗？”由美担心地问。她将手放在她“阿姨”的背上。亮司也仔细观察着，眼中闪过一丝对她安危的担忧。慢慢地，她从原来的位置站起身，压抑着呜咽。

"I'm fine," Asuka replied, running a hand through her hair, glancing at them all, "Let's just not talk about that kind of stuff, okay? It just isn't something I really enjoy talking about."  
"我没事," 明日香回答，用手梳理着头发，瞥了他们一眼，"我们别谈那些了，好吗？那不是我真正喜欢谈论的话题。"

"Am I in trouble?" Yumi asked, a terrified glint in her eye.  
"我会惹上麻烦吗？" 优米问，眼中闪过一丝恐惧。

"No, you're not in trouble."  
"不，你没惹麻烦。"

"Are you going to tell my mommy?" Yumi asked, even more concerned.  
"你要告诉我妈妈吗？" 优美问，更加担忧了。

"I don't think I will," Asuka replied, grimacing in amusement, "Well, actually, I might, but just so she'd talk to you privately about it, maybe."  
"我觉得我不会，" 明日香回答，带着一丝戏谑的苦笑，"嗯，其实，我可能会，但只是为了让妈妈私下和你谈谈，或许。"

"Okay," Yumi replied, resigning to her fate.  
"好吧，" 优美回答，无奈地接受了命运。

After finishing the Weiner Schnitzel, Shinji prepared the rice balls that Yumi had so desperately begged for, and that Shinji so desperately craved. Asuka was playing her games once more with Ryouji, and Yumi was rummaging through her backpack for something that Shinji could not see. As he set out the rice balls on the table, announcing their completion, she watched as Yumi pulled out a large sketchbook, an object she gazed upon with a look of sheer pride. She approached Asuka, and tapped her on the shoulder. This surprised her, which gave Ryouji a perfect opportunity to deliver a fatal blow to her character, leaving her open to a humiliating stage Fatality. Her eyes widened in horror as she watched her character fly through the air, fall through space, and land with a sickening splatter against a carpet of iron spikes. With a look of sheer mortification and fury, she rounded on Yumi. "What is it?!" she snapped, as though she had just caught Yumi stealing something precious away from her.  
吃完维也纳炸肉排后，真嗣准备起了由美子苦苦哀求、而他本人也渴望至极的饭团。明日香正和亮司再次玩着游戏，而由美子则在背包里翻找着什么，真嗣看不清。当他将饭团摆上桌，宣告完成时，他看到由美子抽出了一本大画册，她凝视着它，脸上满是自豪。她走向明日香，轻拍她的肩膀。这让她吃了一惊，给了亮司一个绝佳的机会，对她的角色施以致命一击，让她暴露在令人羞辱的舞台终结技之下。她惊恐地睁大眼睛，看着自己的角色飞过空中，穿过空间，最终以令人作呕的声响落在一片铁刺地毯上。带着极度的尴尬和愤怒，她转向由美子。“什么事？！”她厉声问道，仿佛刚刚抓到由美子偷走了她的珍贵之物。

Yumi, who looked as though Asuka was about to bludgeon her with a battle axe, and in all honesty it looked like Asuka would have found that to be a rather suiting punishment for distracting her, extended the notebook to the German and cried, frightened, "I'm sorry! I just wanted to show you something to make up for before! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!"  
优子看起来就像明日香要拿战斧劈她一样，说实话，明日香似乎觉得这种惩罚对分散她注意力的人来说相当合适。她将笔记本递给德国女孩，惊恐地哭喊道：“对不起！我只是想给你看点东西来弥补之前的过失！对不起！真的很抱歉！”

"Stop saying you're sorry."  
“别再说对不起了。”

"Yes, sorr—er—" “是的，对不——呃——”

"You take after that idiot, don't you?" Asuka asked, gesturing over to Shinji, who stared at Asuka with a look of confusion. She just had to drag him into this, didn't he? Drag him into a conversation that didn't involve him. Well, despite that, the little girl was clearly amused by Asuka calling Shinji an idiot. Her expression calming, perhaps after rationalizing that loosing to a little child at a fighting game once wasn't the end of the world nor should it be, she accepted the notebook, and glanced at the first page. "Wow, this is actually pretty good for a seven year old. Did you draw this?"  
"你还真像那个笨蛋，不是吗？" 明日香问道，指了指一旁的真嗣，后者一脸困惑地看着明日香。她非得把他扯进来吗？扯进一个与他无关的对话里。不过，这个小女孩显然被明日香称真嗣为笨蛋逗乐了。她的表情缓和下来，或许是在理性思考后认为，输给一个小孩子在格斗游戏里一次并不是世界末日，也不应该如此，她接过笔记本，瞥了一眼第一页。"哇，作为一个七岁孩子，这画得真不错。这是你画的吗？"

"Uh-huh," Yumi said, proudly.  
"嗯哼，" 由美自豪地说道。

As Asuka flipped through the pages, she continued, "I mean, no stick figures, just real looking people. When I was your age, I—I—" Asuka's eyes widened slowly as she stared at one individual page, her mouth contorting as she struggled to find words to describe what she was trying to say. Yumi glanced at her, relatively confused. She probably wasn't sure whether Asuka being speechless was a good or bad omen. She glanced over Asuka's shoulder to see the picture in question, only to smile.  
明日香翻阅着页面，继续说道："我是说，没有火柴人，都是栩栩如生的人物。我像你这么大的时候，我——我——" 明日香的眼睛慢慢睁大，她盯着其中一页，嘴巴扭曲着，努力寻找合适的词汇来描述她的感受。由美疑惑地看着她，不太确定明日香说不出话是好是坏。她凑到明日香肩后，想看看那幅画，随即露出了微笑。

"Oh! I really like that picture."  
"哦！我真的很喜欢那张画。"

Shinji wanted to inch nearer, but she was sure Asuka would explain it later. He finished the rice balls as Asuka asked, in a strained tone, "How did you, uh, draw this?"  
真嗣想再靠近一点，但她确信明日香稍后会解释。他按照明日香的要求吃完了饭团，明日香用一种紧张的语气问道：“你是怎么，呃，画出这个的？”

"What do you mean?" "你什么意思？"

"Did you copy from a picture?"  
“你是照着图片临摹的吗？”

"Oh! No! Nothing like that! I met someone who looked like that, and I thought she was really cool looking, so I sketched her. I asked her to pose and everything."  
"哦！不！不是那样的！我遇到了一个看起来像她的人，我觉得她看起来很酷，所以就给她画了张素描。我还请她摆姿势呢。"

"Asked her to pose?" "请她摆姿势？"

"Uh-huh." "嗯嗯。"

"Are you lying to me?"  
"你在骗我吗？"

"Why would I be lying to you?" Yumi's expression grew tense, as though she were afraid of Asuka yelling at her once more. "It's just another person. I asked her to do a few drawings for me, too. No, wait, that's not what I meant. I meant to say I drew her a few other times, I mean. Sorry if I wasn't clear."  
"我为什么要骗你？"" 优美的表情变得紧张，仿佛害怕明日香再次对她大吼。""只是另一个人而已。我也请她帮我画了几幅画。不，等等，我不是那个意思。我是说我给她画了几次，我是说。如果我没说清楚，对不起。"

Glancing over at Shinji, Asuka snapped, "Dummkopf! Get over here!"  
瞥了一眼真嗣，明日香厉声道：“笨蛋！快过来！”

"What?" "什么？"

"You heard me! Look at this drawing!"  
"你听到了！看看这幅画！"

Shinji darted over, mildly happy that the rice balls were at the very least finished. She wondered what could possible surprise Asuka this much. It took a lot to startle his fiancé. Judging by the comments she made, he doubted the German was stunned by the artistic ability of this special younger. In fact, he felt it was something much more, something important, that would startle him upon looking at the picture.  
真嗣迅速凑了过去，略感欣慰至少饭团已经做好了。她好奇是什么能让明日香如此惊讶。要让他的未婚妻感到震惊可不容易。从她的评论来看，他怀疑德国人并非被这位特殊小辈的艺术才能所震撼。实际上，他觉得这背后隐藏着更为重要、更为惊人的东西，一旦看到那幅画便会明白。

It didn't take long to see what Asuka was so shocked about.  
没过多久，就明白了明日香为何如此震惊。

"Is that who I think it is?" Shinji stammered, his eyes wide in horror.  
"那是我以为的那个人吗？" 真嗣结巴着说，眼中充满了恐惧。

"I can't believe this," Asuka stammered, "Maybe it's a look alike."  
"我简直不敢相信，" 明日香结巴着说，"也许只是长得像而已。"

"It's gotta be. Hey, Yumi, what was the name of this girl?"  
"肯定是。嘿，由美，这个女孩叫什么名字？"

Smiling brightly, Yumi replied, "She said her name was Rei. Rei Ayanami."  
笑容灿烂地，优米回答道：“她说她的名字是绫波丽。”

**Part 6 第六部分**

"I want to see the remains of Rei Ayanami."  
“我想看看绫波零的遗体。”

"What? Right now?" "什么？现在吗？"

"Yes!" "是的！"

Asuka was still trembling, her balled up fists squeezed, her nails almost piercing her soft palm. She couldn't believe it. That little kid, Yumi, Misato's daughter, had drawn a picture of Rei Ayanami! That stupid doll! That bitch! Asuka couldn't deny that one of the things she was mildly happy about when she returned to the real world was that living doll no longer existed. Her remains, the monstrous mutilated pieces of her that drifted in the sea of LCL, had been collected by NERV and deposited in a deep underground vault. By now, information regarding Rei Ayanami had become public to NERV personal only thanks to Misato's investigation and Fuyutsuki's revelations. Asuka couldn't deny that most of the information regarding the blue haired witch didn't surprise her.  
明日香仍在颤抖，紧握的拳头挤压着，指甲几乎刺入她柔软的掌心。她无法相信。那个小鬼，美里的女儿，由美，居然画了一幅绫波零的画！那个愚蠢的玩偶！那个婊子！明日香不得不承认，当她回到现实世界时，她略感欣慰的事情之一就是那个活生生的玩偶不再存在了。她的残骸，那些在 LCL 海洋中漂浮的可怕残肢，已被 NERV 收集并存放在一个深地下的保险库中。如今，关于绫波零的信息仅对 NERV 内部人员公开，这多亏了美里的调查和冬月的揭露。明日香不得不承认，关于那个蓝发女巫的大部分信息并未让她感到惊讶。

"Why do you want to?" Fuyutsuki asked, mildly irritated. Asuka handed over Yumi's notebook to the Commander, a grim expression on her face. "What's this? A kid's sketchbook?" The book was opened to the drawing of Rei Ayanami, at which he shook his head. "Could just be coincidence."  
"你为什么要这么做？" 冬月问道，语气中带着些许不悦。明日香将由美的笔记本递给指挥官，脸上带着严肃的表情。"这是什么？一个孩子的素描本？" 书本翻到了绫波零的画页，他摇了摇头。"可能只是巧合。"

"She specifically said she drew someone she had seen on the street. AND she referred to her as Rei Ayanami. What more evidence do you need?" Asuka snapped.  
"她明确说了她画的是在街上看到的人。而且她还称她为绫波零。你还需要什么证据？" 明日香厉声说道。

"Who drew this?" "这是谁画的？"

"Misato's daughter." "美里小姐的女儿。"

"Oh, well, maybe she saw a picture or heard her mother mention her name," Fuyutsuki replied.  
"哦，也许她看到了一张照片，或者听她妈妈提到了她的名字，" 冬月回答道。

"That's what I asked. She said she didn't copy a picture, and Misato would never mention Rei around her daughter."  
"我也是这么问的。她说她没有复制照片，而且美里绝不会在她女儿面前提起丽。"

"How do you know that?"  
"你怎么知道这些的？"

"Well, who'd want to?" Asuka asked.  
"哼，谁会想要呢？" 明日香问道。

Fuyutsuki grimaced in submission. "You really despised that girl, didn't you? Rei, I mean."  
冬月皱眉表示屈服。"你真的很讨厌那个女孩，对吧？我是说绫波。"

"Yes," Asuka replied, not giving further explanation, not remembering how that girl had received so much attention from her superiors despite being the weakest of the pilots, not remembering how that blue haired bitch had stolen Shinji's attention, not remembering just how that bitch reminded her of dolls.  
"是的，"明日香回答，没有进一步解释，不记得那个女孩是如何尽管是最弱的驾驶员却得到了上级的那么多关注，不记得那个蓝发婊子是如何抢走了真嗣的注意力，不记得那个婊子是如何让她想起了那些玩偶。

A noose hanging from the rafters.  
从椽子上悬挂下来的绳套。

"Something wrong?" Fuyutsuki asked, curiously.  
“有什么不对劲吗？”冬月问道，带着好奇。

"It's nothing," Asuka replied, shaking her head, "I still have to have access to Rei's body! I want to see it, now."  
“没什么，”明日香回答，摇了摇头，“我还需要接触丽身体！我现在就想看看。”

"Fine, if you insist that badly, I'll give you temporary clearance. Just don't touch anything."  
"好吧，既然你这么坚持，我就给你临时通行证。只是别乱碰东西。"

#

"The pot's boiling over," Toji called over to his wife, staring at the oven in mild fear as he hastily chopped vegetables.  
"锅要溢出来了，" 真嗣对着妻子喊道，一边紧张地盯着烤箱，一边匆忙切着蔬菜。"

"Can you get it, please?" Hikari called from another room, "I'm kinda busy here."  
"你能处理一下吗？" 光从另一个房间喊道，"我这里有点忙。"

"I don't know—" "我不知道——"

"I'll handle it," Shinji replied, rising to take care of the pots of food on the oven.  
"我来处理，" 真嗣回答道，起身去照看烤箱上的锅子。

"Aw, thanks a lot," Toji replied, a smile of relief on his face.  
"啊，真是太感谢了，" 东治回答，脸上露出释然的微笑。

"Don't worry." Shinji enjoyed cooking by this point. He did it all the time for Asuka, so by now, he was used to preparing food. In fact, he had grown to enjoy it rather much. He didn't know why, but the idea that he was creating something with his own hands, blending tastes, playing God over the dishes of food, and, in the end, seeing other people smile because of him. It sent a wave of pride throughout his body, as though he was doing something right.  
"别担心。" 此时的真嗣已经很喜欢烹饪了。他经常为明日香做饭，所以现在已经习惯了准备食物。事实上，他甚至开始相当享受这个过程。他不知道为什么，但亲手创造东西的想法，调配味道，掌控着食物的命运，最终看到别人因为他而露出笑容。这让他全身涌起一股自豪感，仿佛他做对了什么。

"So how's the pregnant devil?" Toji asked, curiously, from his chopping.  
"那怀孕的小恶魔怎么样了？" 正在切菜的冬二好奇地问。

"Eh, she's fine," Shinji replied, "She's just looking at something right now, over at NERV."  
"呃，她挺好的，" 真嗣回答，"她现在正在 NERV 那边看什么东西。"

"What's that?" Toji asked.  
"那是什么？" 冬二问道。

"Not sure," Shinji lied. "不太确定，" 真嗣撒了个谎。

"Oh, okay," Toji replied.  
"哦，好吧，" 冬二回答道。

"Toji, could you get me diapers?" Hikari called out.  
“冬二，你能帮我拿些尿布吗？” 光喊道。

"Uh, okay!" Toji sprinted to a cabinet full of diapers, grabbed one, and muttered, as he ran off, in a rather hasty mantra, "Please don't let me change her diapers, please don't let me change her diapers, please don't let me change her diapers…" After a few moments, he returned, an expression of relief on his face.  
“呃，好的！” 冬二冲向一个装满尿布的柜子，抓起一片，边跑边急促地念叨，“千万别让我给她换尿布，千万别让我给她换尿布，千万别让我给她换尿布……” 过了一会儿，他回来了，脸上带着释然的表情。

"I guess you didn't change the diapers?" Shinji asked, tending to the rest of the food on the oven.  
“我猜你没换尿布吧？” 真嗣问道，忙着烤箱里剩下的食物。

"Very funny." Returning to his chopping, Toji asked, mildly, "So is your future wife having cravings yet?"  
"真搞笑。" 回到切菜中，Toji 温和地问，"那么，你未来老婆开始有孕期反应了吗？"

"Cravings?" Shinji asked.  
"孕期反应？" 真嗣问道。

"Yeah, you know, cravings. For food, you know," Toji asked.  
"对，你知道的，孕期反应。对食物的那种，明白吧，" Toji 问道。

"Not that I can think of," Shinji replied, thinking of the wide variety of food he served at home.  
"我想不起来有什么特别的，" 真嗣回答道，想起了家里提供的各式各样的食物。

"Hikari had to have lots of beets when she was pregnant," Toji replied, "I don't know why beets, but she just needed them. Knowing Asuka, she'll probably be craving some random German food."  
"光怀孕的时候特别想吃甜菜，" 渡回答，"我不知道为什么是甜菜，但她就是需要。以明日香的性格，她可能会突然想吃些德国菜吧。"

"Well, it's a good thing she's been teaching me how to cook that sort of stuff," Shinji replied.  
"嗯，还好她一直在教我怎么烹饪那些东西，" 真嗣回答。

"Really?" "真的吗？"

"Yeah, she even taught me a bit of German," Shinji replied.  
"是啊，她甚至还教了我一点德语，" 真嗣回答道。"

"Did she charge you money for lessons?"  
"她收你学费了吗？"

"No, she just wanted help learning how to read and write kanji."  
"不，她只是想寻求帮助学习如何读写汉字。"

"You mean she can't read kanji? How long has she been in this country now?"  
"你是说她不会读汉字？她来这个国家多久了？"

"German's her native language, and that's VERY different from Japanese," Shinji replied, "I barely know German, just a few words." Shinji was being humble here and defending his fiancé; he had picked up German pretty easily; it was Asuka who had extreme difficulty with Japanese.  
"德语是她的母语，那和日语差别非常大，" 真嗣回答道，"我对德语几乎一窍不通，只知道几个词。" 真嗣在这里表现得谦虚，并为自己的未婚妻辩护；他其实很容易就学会了德语；反而是明日香对日语感到极其困难。"

"Oh, okay, that's fine," Toji replied, "I know a bit of English only because I've gone on business trips to America, but that's it."  
"哦，好的，没关系，" 冬二回答道，"我只因为出差去过美国，所以懂一点英语，仅此而已。"

"Toji!" "冬二！"

"Yeah?" "嗯？"

"Can you make sure Shinji doesn't come into the parlor?"  
"你能确保真嗣不进客厅吗？"

"Why's that?" "为什么呢？"

"I'm breast feeding and I don't want him to see."  
"我在哺乳，不想让他看到。"

Shinji imagined, for a brief moment, Hikari placing her dear son's lips to her plumped bosom. The gentle sounds of sucking, the gentle rocking back and forth, a rhythmic pattern that almost made Shinji—  
真嗣短暂地想象了一下，光将她亲爱的儿子的嘴唇贴在她丰满的胸脯上。那轻柔的吮吸声，轻轻地前后摇晃，一种近乎让真嗣——

"You're thinking dirty thoughts about Hikari, aren't you?" Toji asked, through narrowed eyes, "Stop it. Now."  
"你肯定在想些对光不纯洁的事，对吧？" 冬二眯着眼睛问道，"别想了，现在就停下。"

#

There her body was, resting in an artificial lake of LCL. Bobbing back and forth, clearly dead, her vacant unseeing eye staring directly at Asuka. She was dead, long dead. This gigantic, titanic entity, kept in a massive vault underground at NERV, was all that remained of her. She was dead! There was no way Yumi could've possibly seen that doll alive. There just wasn't any way.  
她的身体就那样躺在人造的 LCL 湖中，随波逐流，显然已经死去，那空洞无神的眼睛直勾勾地盯着明日香。她早已死去，长眠于此。这个庞大无比的巨型存在，被安置在 NERV 地下深处的巨大保险库中，仅剩她的遗骸。她已经死了！由美不可能看到那个玩偶还活着。这根本不可能。

"Satisfied?" Asuka turned to see Misato Katsuragi behind her, a small smile on her lips.  
"满意了吗？" 明日香转身看到身后的葛城美里，她嘴角挂着一丝微笑。

"How did you—" "你怎么——"

"Fuyutsuki told me all about it," Misato replied, "Yumi has quite an imagination, huh?"  
"冬月都告诉我了，"美里回答，"由美子想象力真丰富，对吧？"

"Are you hiding anything from me?" Asuka asked, inquisitively.  
"你有什么事瞒着我吗？"明日香好奇地问。"

"Hiding? Why would I do that?" Misato replied, surprised.  
"躲藏？我为什么要那么做？" 美里回答，感到惊讶。

"Seriously, are you? I can keep a secret, I just need to know if that doll is out there."  
"说真的，你是吗？我能保守秘密，我只是需要知道那个玩偶是否在外面。"

"Doll?" Misato laughed, "So that's what this is all about."  
"玩偶？" 美里笑了，"原来这就是问题的关键。"

Asuka's face contorted in rage. "What the hell does that mean?"  
明日香的脸因愤怒而扭曲。“那他妈是什么意思？”

"It all makes sense now. Rei reminded you of your mother's—"  
“现在一切都明白了。丽让你想起了你母亲的——”

"Shut up!" Asuka snapped, clamping her hands over her ears as she turned away. The damage was done, though. In her mind's eye, clear as day, she could see it, a body hanging from the rafters by a noose, a doll swinging back and forth at its side. Upon opening her eyes, she could see a planet sized doll staring back at her, a crooked grin on its face, laughing at her even in death. She wanted to throw something at that bitch, that dead looking face that sneered at her, but couldn't. She couldn't damage that piece of carrion, or Fuyutsuki would flip out.  
“闭嘴！”明日香厉声打断，双手紧紧捂住耳朵转身背对。但伤害已经造成。在她脑海中，那画面清晰如白昼，一具尸体悬挂在横梁上，绳索缠绕，旁边一个玩偶来回摆动。睁开眼时，她看到一个星球大小的玩偶正盯着她，脸上挂着歪斜的笑容，即使在死亡中也在嘲笑她。她想朝那婊子扔点什么，那张死气沉沉的脸嘲弄着她，但她做不到。她不能伤害那具尸体，否则冬月会发疯的。

"I'm sorry," Misato replied, frowning, "Have you told Shinji about that?"  
"对不起，" 美里皱着眉回答，"你告诉真嗣这件事了吗？"

"No," Asuka replied after a moment of silence.  
"没有，" 明日香沉默片刻后回答。

"I think you should. It'll help get a lot off your chest," Misato replied.  
"我觉得你应该告诉他。这样会让你心里轻松很多，" 美里回答。

"I'm fine. I'll handle it on my own."  
"我没事。我自己能处理。"

"Shinji shared everything from his past with you, right? Shouldn't you do the same?"  
"真嗣把他过去的所有事情都告诉你了，对吧？你不也应该这样做吗？"

Sighing, the German replied, running a hand through her hair, "He has enough to worry about. I wouldn't want to pile another burden on him. I already ask him to make me food and clean the house. If I were to ask him to help carry all my problems on his back, I think I'd be asking too much of him. The least I can do is carry his burdens and mine. That way, we're even."  
叹了口气，这位德国人回答道，一边用手梳理着她的头发，"他已经有够多烦心事了。我不想再给他增加负担。我已经让他给我做饭和打扫房子了。如果我还要他帮我背负所有的问题，我觉得我要求得太多了。至少我能做的，是承担起他的负担和我的。这样，我们就扯平了。"

"But I think he'd want to carry your burdens. It would be his way of saying things are okay," Misato replied.  
"但我想他会愿意替你分担重担的。这将是他用行动表达一切都会好起来的方式，"美里回答道。

"I don't want him to, so shut up about it, already!"  
"我不想让他这么做，所以别再提了！"

"Alright, I understand," Misato replied, "Oh, and by the way, regarding Yumi and the whole thing with your mother, I took care of it, like you asked."  
"好吧，我明白了，"美里回答，"哦，对了，关于由美和与你母亲相关的那件事，我已经按照你的要求处理好了。"

"What did you say?" Asuka asked.  
"你说什么？" 明日香问道。

"That your mother was dead and it was a touchy subject for you."  
"说你母亲去世了，这对你是敏感话题。"

"Did you say anything else?"  
"你还说了别的吗？"

"Not at all." "一点儿也不。"

"Thanks." "谢谢。"

#

"I'm home," Shinji replied, ignoring the fact that the house was silent and the lights were off. He walked in, removing his shoes only to walk over to the stove. He was about to set a pot to boil when he heard it: a phone ringing. He glanced at it, curiously. Was it Toji? Had he left something there by accident? Or maybe it was Asuka, telling him something about Rei that she had discovered. He approached the phone, nonchalantly, and answered it. "Hello?"  
"我回来了，" 真嗣回答道，无视了房子里寂静无声、灯火全灭的事实。他走进门，脱下鞋子，径直走向炉灶。正准备把锅放上去烧水时，他听到了电话铃声。他好奇地瞥了一眼。是东治吗？他是不是不小心落下了什么东西？或者是明日香，告诉他发现了关于绫波的什么事情。他漫不经心地走向电话，接了起来。"喂？"

"Hallo? Wer ist dieses?" "喂？是谁啊？"

"Huh?" Shinji stammered, surprised to hear an unfamiliar female voice on the other side of the phone, "Excuse me?"  
"啊？"" 真嗣结巴道，惊讶于电话那头传来一个陌生的女性声音，""不好意思，您是？"

"Ist Asuka dort?" "请问是明日香吗？"

"Uh, Asuka?" Shinji tried to remember some of the German he had learned from his fiancé, and decided to speak. "Uh, she's not home right now. Who is this?"  
"呃，明日香？" 真嗣试图回忆他从未婚妻那里学到的德语，决定开口说话。"呃，她现在不在家。您是哪位？"

"This is her sister." "我是她姐姐。"

"Wait, sister?!" Shinji stammered, "She has a sister?"  
"等等，姐姐？！" 真嗣结巴道，"她有个姐姐？"

"Yes, she does. Who're you, exactly?"  
"是的，她是。你到底是谁？"

"I'm Shinji, her fiancé," he said, on instinct. It was only after the words came out of her mouth that he realized what he had just said, and how Asuka's sister wouldn't know that they were engaged.  
"我是真嗣，她的未婚夫，"他本能地说道。直到话从她嘴里说出来后，他才意识到自己刚刚说了什么，以及明日香的妹妹不会知道他们订婚了。

There was a moment of silence before the voice on the other line asked, curiously, "Verlobtes?"  
电话那头沉默了一会儿，然后好奇地问道："订婚？"

"Uh, yeah, uh…" "呃，是的，呃…"

"When did this happen!?" "这是什么时候发生的！？"

"A month or two ago."  
"大约一两个月前。"

"And she didn't tell us?"  
"她没告诉我们吗？"

"Uh, I thought she did."  
"呃，我以为她说了。"

There was a period of silence again before Asuka's sister snapped, "So when are you going to come to Germany."  
又是一阵沉默，随后明日香的姐姐厉声问道：“那你什么时候来德国？”

"Germany!?" "德国！？"

"Who're you talking to?" a familiar voice behind him asked in a cold, dark tone.  
"你在跟谁说话？" 一个熟悉的声音在他背后冷冷地问道，带着一丝阴暗的语气。

"Oh, uh, hi Asuka. You wouldn't believe who just called just now…"  
"哦，呃，嗨，明日香。你绝对猜不到刚才谁打电话来了……"

---
**Part 7 第七部分**

"SHINJI, YOU IDIOT!" “真嗣，你这个笨蛋！”

"I'm sorry! I didn't realize—"  
"对不起！我没意识到——"

"You idiot! Don't talk, just stay quiet!" Asuka snapped, pacing back and forth, her hands balled up in fists as she glared venomously at her fiancé. It wasn't that she was really made at him, but it was a hell of a lot easier to shout at him than it was to shout at her sister over in Germany for calling her like that. Asuka was about to call her, too, once she found out what was up with Yumi drawing Ayanami. Still, the revelation that her sister had called while her back was turned was enough to make her forget momentarily about Wonder Girl. "You shouldn't have said you were my fiancé!"  
"你这个白痴！别说话，安静点！" 明日香厉声喝道，来回踱步，双手紧握成拳，恶狠狠地瞪着她的未婚夫。倒不是她真的对他生气，只是对他大吼比对远在德国的姐姐大吼要容易得多。明日香本来也打算打电话给姐姐，一旦她弄清楚由美为什么会画绫波零。然而，得知姐姐在她转身时打来电话的事实，足以让她暂时忘记了对绫波零的疑惑。"你不该说你是我的未婚夫！"

"Why not?" Shinji asked. "为什么不行？" 真嗣问道。

"Because now I'm going to have to go back to Germany and drag you along with me," Asuka snapped.  
"因为现在我不得不回德国，还得把你也拖上，"明日香厉声说道。

"But I thought you felt Germany was the greatest nation in the world," Shinji replied, his eyes narrowed.  
"但我觉得你认为德国是世界上最伟大的国家，"真嗣回答，眼睛眯了起来。

"Yeah, well, it is, but I hate having to see my parents!" The sounds of her father and stepmother making love echoed through her head, a sound superimposed to the memories of her mother in her hospital ward, stroking the doll she believed to be her daughter. She shook the memories out of her head before continuing her point. "They just bother me, alright?"  
"是啊，没错，但我不喜欢不得不见我的父母！"她父亲和继母做爱的声音在她脑海中回响，这声音与她母亲在医院病房里抚摸着她认为是自己女儿的玩偶的记忆重叠在一起。她摇摇头，把这些记忆甩开，继续说道。"他们就是让我心烦，行了吧？

"Okay, fine, but you were going to have to tell them eventually," Shinji replied.  
"好吧，行，但你迟早得告诉他们，" 真嗣回答道。

"Not necessarily," she replied.  
"不一定，" 她回答说。

"Were you just going to run away?"  
"你只是打算逃跑吗？"

"Don't throw that rhetoric at me, you stupid house broken male!" Asuka snapped, pointing at her fiancé with a look of utter disdain. Sure, his frail backbone was holding firm for this instance, but it wasn't enough to persuade Asuka that she was being unreasonable. He didn't know her family, nor did he know just why she wanted to avoid them like the plague. Then again, it wasn't his place to know. She had just wanted to keep him away from that side of her, and yet it had come to drag Shinji deeper into her tangled web of suffering. Sighing for a moment, inhaling in an attempt to calm herself, she said, her face beet red, "We need to figure out how we can do this."  
"别用那套说辞来对付我，你这个被驯化的蠢男人！" 明日香厉声喝道，指着她的未婚夫，脸上满是鄙夷。没错，他那脆弱的脊梁这次倒是挺得笔直，但这还不足以说服明日香她是在无理取闹。他不了解她的家庭，也不知道她为何像躲避瘟疫一样避开他们。再说了，他也没必要知道。她只是想让他远离自己的那一面，然而事与愿违，这反而让真嗣更深地陷入了她痛苦的纠葛之中。她叹了口气，深吸一口气试图平复心情，脸涨得通红，说道："我们需要想个办法来解决这件事。"

"When are we going over there, again?"  
"我们什么时候再去那边？"

#

"When was the last time you came over here?"  
"你上次是什么时候来这儿的？"

"Too long, Kate," Asuka had said in a falsely sweet sounding voice, speaking real, fluent German for the first time in months. She was surprised to hear a slight Japanese accent in her tone. She had been away from her motherland for too long, and yet, at the same time, was hesitant to go back there for years in fear she'd have to speak to her parents again.  
"太长了，凯特，" 明日香用一种假甜的声音说道，几个月来第一次流利地说起了真正的德语。她惊讶地发现自己语调中带有一丝日本口音。她离开祖国太久了，然而与此同时，又因多年害怕不得不再次与父母交谈而犹豫是否回去。

"Well, I hear you have a fiancé," her sister Kate had replied in an inquisitive tone. Her sister wasn't like Asuka. As opposed to her, Kate lacked the fourth of Japanese blood her mother had given her. All she had was the Langley blood, but not the Sohryu blood. That's what made her different, made her an alien.  
"嗯，我听说你有个未婚夫，" 她的姐姐凯特用一种好奇的语气回答。她的姐姐不像明日香。与她相反，凯特缺乏母亲赋予她的四分之一日本血统。她只有兰格利家族的血统，却没有惣流家的血统。这就是让她与众不同，让她成为一个异类的原因。

"Yeah, I've been meaning to tell you, but things have been so hectic I completely forgot," Asuka replied.  
"是的，我一直想告诉你，但事情太忙乱了，我完全忘记了，" 明日香回答道。

"I can imagine, what with wedding plans and all that. So who is the lucky man. Shinji? Isn't that the name of the Third Child?"  
"我能想象，毕竟婚礼计划什么的。那么，那位幸运的男士是谁？真嗣？那不是第三适格者的名字吗？"

"Yes." "是的。"

"Wow, I thought you said that guy was an idiot!"  
"哇，我记得你说过那家伙是个笨蛋！"

"Well, he is. A complete and utter idiot, housebroken, stupid, and just—just—"  
"嗯，他就是。一个彻头彻尾的傻瓜，驯服了，愚蠢，而且——就是——就是——"

"Aw, it sounds adorable!" Kate had squealed. Asuka had cringed at the sound of her voice. She resented everything about that girl. It wasn't her fault she was her stepmother's daughter, but that didn't mean she'd just accept Kate with open arms or anything. "So when's the wedding?"  
"啊，听起来好可爱！" 凯特尖叫道。明日香听到她的声音就皱起了眉头。她对那个女孩的一切都感到厌恶。虽然不是她的错，她是继母的女儿，但这并不意味着她会张开双臂欣然接受凯特。"那婚礼是什么时候？"

"What?" "什么？"

"The wedding. When is it?"  
"婚礼。什么时候举行？"

"Oh, that. Well, we're planning on having it in a few months."  
"哦，那个啊。我们打算几个月后办。"

"When are you guys planning on having a baby?"  
"你们打算什么时候要孩子？"

"A little under nine months."  
"差不多九个月后。"

She did despise slips of the tongue.  
她确实讨厌口误。

"What was that?" “那是什么？”

"Nothing! Nothing at all," Asuka replied, frantically, "I didn't say anything!"  
“没什么！一点也没有，”明日香慌忙回答，“我什么都没说！”

"Did you say nine months?"  
"你说九个月？"

There was no point now. She might as well just bite the bullet. Resenting her sister's inquisitive nature with a wave of fury, damning Shinji for getting her into this situation, she said, in an uncharacteristically high voice, "Uh, well, I said less than nine months."  
现在说什么都没用了。她索性豁出去算了。带着一股怒气，怨恨姐姐的好奇心，咒骂真嗣把她拖入这种境地，她用异常尖锐的声音说道：“呃，好吧，我说的是不到九个月。”

"What? Tell me everything. Now."  
"什么？快告诉我一切。现在。"

"Well, you know, stuff happened, and, uh, Kate! Stop giggling!" she snapped, her face filling with a radiant scarlet glow.  
"哎，你知道的，事情发生了，呃，凯特！别笑了！" 她厉声说道，脸上泛起一片绯红的光彩。

"I can't help it! It's just too rich! You a mother!"  
"我忍不住！这太有趣了！你居然成了妈妈！"

"Oh shut up!" "哦，闭嘴！"

"So when're you coming over to introduce your fiancé?"  
"那你什么时候带未婚夫过来介绍给我们认识？"

Asuka had sighed, shaking her head. She had ran a hand through her hair, wondering when a good time would be. She wouldn't have minded coming over on February 30th, or maybe the day after the End of Time. However, she couldn't just say that to her sister. She glanced over at Shinji, considering for a moment to ask him for advice, only to turn away, harshly. That bastard was the reason she was put into this situation; the last thing she wanted was to hear his voice right now. "I don't know. What time's good for you?"  
明日香叹了口气，摇了摇头。她用手捋了捋头发，思索着何时是合适的时间。她并不介意在 2 月 30 日，或者也许是时间尽头后的第二天过来。然而，她不能就这样告诉她姐姐。她瞥了一眼真嗣，考虑了一会儿是否要向他寻求建议，结果却猛地转过头去。那个混蛋是她陷入这种境地的原因；她现在最不想听到的就是他的声音。“我不知道。你什么时候方便？”

"Hang on a sec. Mom wants to talk to you." Asuka had cringed yet again. Just what she needed, her damn stepmother on the line. Clenching her fists into tight little balls, she had waited until that little brat deposited the phone in her mother's hands, only to count the seconds until that dreaded voice rang through the phone.  
"稍等一下。妈妈想跟你说话。"明日香再次皱起了眉头。真是她需要的，她那该死的继母在电话那头。她紧握拳头，等待着那个小鬼把电话交给她的母亲，然后开始数秒，直到那个令人畏惧的声音通过电话传来。

"Hello, dear?" At the sound of that voice, the woman had become a girl once more, a girl running through German air, running toward a door beyond which remained a dead corpse hanging from the rafters. She had held the memories at bay as she had focused on the then and there, in Japan, in Tokyo-3, NOT in Germany.  
"亲爱的，你好吗？" 听到那个声音，女人瞬间变回了女孩，一个在德国天空中奔跑的女孩，朝着一扇门跑去，门后是一具悬挂在横梁上的尸体。她一直将这些记忆拒之门外，专注于当下和那里，在日本，在第三新东京市，而不是在德国。

"Hello, mother!" Asuka had called out in a forced cheery tone, "How are you?"  
"你好，妈妈！" 明日香用一种刻意欢快的语气喊道，"你还好吗？"

"What's this I hear about you getting married?"  
"我听说你要结婚了，这是怎么回事？"

She did indeed cut straight to the point. Recovering from her momentary stunned silence, she had replied, with a forced smile on her face and a force girlish laugh in her voice, "Aw, sorry I didn't tell you before. So much has happened lately I've just forgotten to tell you that sort of thing. I hope you can forgive me." Oh how she had just wanted to tell that stupid bitch that she had avoided calling her this whole time. Had it not been for that idiot picking up the phone, she'd still avoid communication with that woman. It wasn't like she was her real mother anyway.  
她的确直截了当地切入主题。从短暂的震惊沉默中恢复过来，她脸上强挤出笑容，声音里带着刻意的少女般笑声，回答道：“哎呀，对不起，之前没告诉你。最近发生了太多事，我忘了告诉你这些。希望你能原谅我。”哦，她多么想直接告诉那个愚蠢的婊子，她这段时间一直避免给她打电话。如果不是那个白痴接了电话，她还会继续避免与那个女人联系。反正她也不是她的亲生母亲。

"It's quite alright. I suppose I can forgive you, but next time, please tell your family about such major developments, alright?"  
“没关系。我想我可以原谅你，但下次，请务必告诉你的家人这些重大变化，好吗？”

"Sure, okay." “当然，好的。”

"Such as you going about and making me a grandmother without ever informing me."  
"比如你四处走动，让我成了祖母，却从未告知我一声。"

Asuka had wanted to shout out that her stepmother could rest assured that she wasn't the baby's grandfather and that Kyoko Sohryu was the legitimate grandmother, but, once again, she held that indignation inside of her chest as she had replied, in a sugary tone, "I'm sorry about that too!"  
明日香本想大声反驳，告诉她的继母大可放心，她绝不是那孩子的祖父，而绫波零才是合法的祖母，但又一次，她将那份愤慨压在胸中，用甜腻的语气回答：“我也为此感到抱歉！”

"So who is this man, anyway?"  
"那么，这个男人究竟是谁？"

"Oh, Shinji Ikari." "哦，碇真嗣。"

"Oh, you mean that pilot you worked with?"  
"哦，你是说那个你合作过的驾驶员？"

"The same." "正是他。"

"We're all very proud of what you did as a child, you know. I think all of Germany would rejoice at your wedding." Truthfully, judging by how the NERV building was damaged in Japan, she seriously doubted that any nation would rejoice about the union of two small individuals. Clearly her stepmother was trying to play up her pride, an aspect of herself that had deflated gradually over the years. Regardless, it did boost her spirits up slightly, if only for a moment.  
"我们都非常为你小时候的成就感到骄傲，你知道的。我想整个德国都会为你的婚礼欢欣鼓舞。" 说实话，鉴于日本 NERV 大楼受损的情况，她严重怀疑任何国家会对两个小人物的结合感到高兴。显然，她的继母试图夸大她的自豪感，这是她多年来逐渐消退的一面。尽管如此，这确实让她的心情稍微振奋了一些，哪怕只是片刻。

"Oh, I doubt that," Asuka had replied, honestly, "Anyway, it's been great talking to you, but I'm going to have to—"  
"哦，我对此表示怀疑，" 明日香诚实地回答，"不管怎样，和你聊天很愉快，但我得——"

"When will you be coming over to introduce us to the Third Child?"  
"你什么时候带第三适格者来见我们？"

The moment she had hoped to avoid. "Oh, uh, I don't know, I have a lot of work to do, so I don't know when I'll be able to get over there."  
她一直希望避免的那一刻。“哦，呃，我不知道，我有很多工作要做，所以我不确定什么时候能过去。”

"You can arrange something with your superiors, I'm sure. I'm sure they let people off for brief vacations and maternity leave and the like."  
“你肯定能和你的上司安排一下。我相信他们会允许人们休短暂的假期、产假之类的。”

This was very true. They did let Misato off TWICE for maternity leave, AND took several vacations to spend time with her children, and she had a higher position than either of them did. Fuyutsuki would have no problem giving them time off to visit Germany, much to her dismay. "I'll need to ask." No doubt she'd forget to ask Fuyutsuki and end up replying to her mother that her boss was a jerk that refused to let her take time off. That sounded like a good alibi, until her stepmother spoke.  
这确实没错。他们确实让美里休了两次产假，并且还多次休假去陪伴她的孩子，而她的职位比他们俩都高。冬月会毫不犹豫地给他们放假去德国，这让她非常沮丧。“我需要问问。”毫无疑问，她会忘记问冬月，最终回复她母亲说她的老板是个拒绝让她请假的混蛋。这听起来像是个不错的借口，直到她的继母开口说话。

"Don't worry. I'll just have your father make a call for you."  
"别担心。我让令尊打个电话帮你搞定。"

Damn it! That bitch thought of everything, didn't she? "What? Oh, I don't think you'd need to go to all that trouble!"  
该死！那个婊子真是面面俱到，不是吗？“什么？哦，我觉得你没必要费那么大劲！”

"Oh, no trouble at all! He was going to need to have a telephone conference with your Commander Fuyutsuki regardless in order to settle an affair regarding a German railway system. I'm sure if he asked your boss he'd be delighted to help."  
"哦，一点儿也不麻烦！他本来就需要和你们的指挥官冬月进行一次电话会议，商讨关于德国铁路系统的事务。我相信如果他向你的上司提出请求，他一定会乐意帮忙的。"

"Oh, really, you don't need to go to that much trouble—"  
"哦，真的，你不必这么麻烦——"

"No trouble at all! Shall I request that you're available for, say, two weeks from today so you'd be able to get your affairs in order?"  
"一点儿也不麻烦！我是否可以请求您从今天起的两周内都有空，这样您就能安排好您的事务了？"

"Oh, that should be fine," Asuka resigned.  
"哦，那应该没问题，"明日香无奈地答应道。

"Good. I'll see you in a bit, then. Gute Nacht!"  
"好。那我一会儿见。晚安！"

#

"Two weeks, huh?" Shinji replied, in stunned silence, "That's a little quick."  
"两周，是吗？" 真嗣震惊地沉默了一会儿，"这有点快。"

"She'll hold us to it, you know. There's no way I can avoid it," Asuka sighed in resignation.  
"她会坚持的，你知道的。我没法逃避，" 明日香叹息着接受了现实。"

"It can't be that bad, can it?" Shinji replied, "I mean, you knew this was going to happen sooner or later, so you might as well go ahead and reach out for it." Shinji had never heard the German mention much about her family, so this reaction she had didn't exactly surprise her. The sister hadn't sounded mean on the phone, and the conversation she had with her mother—er, stepmother—didn't sound too unpleasant, so why was it so difficult for her to actually muster the courage to see them? It just didn't add up. Maybe it had something to do with her birthmother.  
"应该没那么糟糕吧，不是吗？" 真嗣回答道，"我是说，你知道这迟早会发生，所以还不如干脆去面对它。" 真嗣从未听这位德国女孩过多提及她的家庭，所以她的这种反应并不让她感到特别惊讶。电话里她的姐姐听起来并不刻薄，而她和母亲——呃，继母——的对话也不算太不愉快，那为什么她就是难以鼓起勇气去见她们呢？这说不通。也许这与她的生母有关。

"What do you think I should do now?" Asuka asked Shinji in a desperate tone.  
"你觉得我现在该怎么办？" 明日香用一种近乎绝望的语气问真嗣。

#

"What do you think I should do now?" Asuka had cried out as fists had beat against the door of the NERV building.  
"你觉得我现在该怎么办？" 明日香哭喊着，拳头重重地敲打在 NERV 大楼的门上。

"I don't know! Grab something! Anything! Barricade the door!" Shinji had shrieked, grabbing every sort of reinforcement he could grab his hands on as he jammed it against the locked door, be it metal bars, pieces of wood, or even dead bodies that had begun to pile up along the ground, the dead bodies riddled with bullets, bodies of comrades who they had allied themselves with along their escape from the concentration camp. It was at moments that these that he was glad that their now dead comrades had the foresight, and the bravery, to sacrifice their lives in order to disable their weapons.  
“我不知道！抓点什么！什么都行！堵住门！” 真嗣尖叫着，抓起他能抓到的所有加固物，无论是金属棒、木块，甚至是开始堆积在地上的尸体，那些尸体布满了弹孔，是他们从集中营逃亡途中结盟的战友。在这些时刻，他庆幸那些已故的战友有先见之明和勇气，牺牲自己的生命来破坏敌人的武器。

Shinji glanced over his shoulder, seeing bloody masses of bodies, some still alive, most dying, many younger than he was. Their wide, terrified eyes staring at the banging beyond the door, a pulsating rhythmic slamming that was almost in synch with Shinji's own heartbeat, powerfully beating against the interior of his ribcage as he reinforced the door, praying that they'd live, praying that he'd be able to build up the walls between him and the enemy long enough for them to escape.  
真嗣回头瞥了一眼，看到血肉模糊的尸体群，有些还活着，大多数奄奄一息，其中许多比他还年轻。他们惊恐的大眼睛盯着门外的撞击声，那有节奏的砰砰声几乎与真嗣自己的心跳同步，有力地撞击着他的胸腔，他在加固门的同时祈祷他们能活下来，祈祷他能建立起足够坚固的屏障，让他们有足够的时间逃脱。

Was this any different from the battles against the Angels? Was it? They were relentless, maybe even worse, maybe just as dangerous. He needed to face his fears and save himself. Otherwise, what did he really learn after all that horror three years earlier in Third Impact?  
这与对抗使徒的战斗有何不同？是吗？它们无情，或许更甚，或许同样危险。他需要直面恐惧，拯救自己。否则，经历了三年前第三次冲击的恐怖后，他究竟学到了什么？

And over his gasping for air, his terrified attempts to live, he could hear the once proud German whispering to herself, in terrified, harsh tones: "I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die."  
在他喘息求生、惊恐挣扎之际，他听到那位曾经骄傲的德国人用恐惧而严厉的语气自言自语：“我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。”

They weren't going to die.  
他们不会死。

Not like this. 不是这样的。

They were closed off in a tiny little room, filthy, bloodstained, and defenseless. There was no hope for survival if those doors gave. They had to make sure it was impossible for the enemy to get in, for those monsters to penetrate their sanctuary. The militia was just a new government that had hoped to regain power in the collapsed regime. Like most of the horrible, destructive groups, it had united under a relatively peaceful philosophy: eliminating evil. A good idea in theory, except the leader, a Jewish zealot, had a deep seated grudge against the Germans because of the Holocaust. Once again, in and of itself, not a terrible opinion. The Nazis had done horrible things to the Jews. However, like all believes, no matter how pure, when pushed to its extreme, it became rotten. The zealot had decided that all Germans were secretly Nazis, and that, in order to avoid a second Holocaust of Jews, he needed to create a Holocaust of Germans. They created dozens of concentration camps just like the Nazis had, all for the same intention: tormenting and killing their enemies.  
他们被关在一个狭小肮脏的房间里，血迹斑斑，毫无防备。如果那些门被攻破，生存的希望将荡然无存。他们必须确保敌人无法闯入，那些怪物无法侵犯他们的避难所。民兵只是一个新成立的政府，希望在崩溃的政权中重掌权力。像大多数可怕的破坏性团体一样，它在一个相对和平的理念下团结起来：消灭邪恶。理论上是个好主意，只是领导者，一个犹太狂热分子，因大屠杀而对德国人怀有深仇大恨。这本身并不是一个糟糕的观点。纳粹对犹太人犯下了可怕的罪行。然而，像所有信仰一样，无论多么纯洁，一旦推向极端，就会腐化。这位狂热分子认定所有德国人都是秘密纳粹分子，为了防止犹太人再次遭受大屠杀，他需要制造一场针对德国人的大屠杀。他们建立了数十个集中营，就像纳粹所做的那样，目的都是为了折磨和消灭他们的敌人。

Shinji became involved when Asuka had been captured, and he along with her for being a "German lover."  
真嗣之所以卷入其中，是因为明日香被捕，而他则因为被视为“德国人的情人”而一同被抓。

They had been sent out by the then unofficial NERV to help with the peace effort, and now they were dragged into a damn war! He just wanted the banging to stop. He wished his mother was there, that Ayanami was there, to save them, to maybe salvage them from the wreckage. But he couldn't wish for miracles now. He had received his fair share of miracles already. There was no time for praying; the time to act was nigh.  
他们曾被当时的非官方组织 NERV 派遣，协助和平事业，如今却被卷入了一场该死的战争！他只希望那震耳欲聋的声响能停止。他多么希望母亲在那里，绫波也在那里，来拯救他们，或许还能从废墟中挽救他们。但他现在不能奢望奇迹。他已经得到了足够多的奇迹。没有时间祈祷了；行动的时刻即将到来。

And then he heard it: gunshots. Gunshot after gunshot echoed through the air, and the sounds of bodies hitting the floor rang even through the thick defenses. Regardless of the gunfire and screams of zealots, Shinji didn't dare lower his guard. There was always a chance the conflict outside would be resolved. He knew the zealots couldn't be the ones shooting, as they didn't have anymore firearms to use. Surely it was a rival militia, perhaps worse than the last. He wouldn't give in now. Maybe, with a bit of lucky, they'd leave the facility alone and let them make a safe escape. Just maybe the zealots would forget about the escapees and let them return to Tokyo-3 safely. Even though it wasn't stable yet, it was a hell of a lot better than Europe right now! Even America would be safe, but Europe was a hell hole at the present time that no one should have the misfortune to dwell in.  
然后他听到了：枪声。一声接一声的枪响在空气中回荡，厚重的防御也挡不住身体倒地的声音。尽管枪声和狂热者的尖叫此起彼伏，真嗣丝毫不敢放松警惕。外面冲突总有解决的可能。他知道那些狂热者不可能在开枪，因为他们已经没有更多武器可用。肯定是另一支敌对民兵，或许比上一次更糟糕。他现在绝不会屈服。也许，只要运气好一点，他们会放过这个设施，让他们安全逃脱。也许狂热者会忘记逃亡者，让他们安全返回第三新东京市。尽管那里还不稳定，但总比现在的欧洲好得多！即使是美国也会安全，但欧洲现在是个地狱，谁都不该有幸生活在那里。

And then there was silence. For a moment, Shinji didn't breathe. For five moments, there was silence. And, after the sixth moment, Shinji drew breath. Turning to his comrades, he said, in a harsh tone, "I think we made it."  
然后是一片寂静。有那么一刻，真嗣屏住了呼吸。五秒钟，一片寂静。第六秒过后，真嗣深吸了一口气。转向他的同伴，他用严厉的语气说：“我想我们成功了。”

#

"When was the last time you were even in Germany?" Shinji asked, curiously.  
“你上次去德国是什么时候？”真嗣好奇地问。

"Well, in the Concentration Camp," Asuka replied.  
"嗯，在集中营里，" 明日香回答道。

"Yeah, but that militia is gone now, so I know that's not what's bothering you," Shinji replied.  
"是啊，但那支民兵现在已经不在了，所以我知道这不是困扰你的原因，" 真嗣回答。

"Yeah, because crazy people trying to kill me is something you just forget after a few days."  
"是啊，因为那些试图杀我的疯子，你不可能几天后就忘得一干二净。"

"Asuka." “明日香。”

"Alright, I just don't want to see my parents. Is that so horrible? You didn't want to see your father after all!"  
“好吧，我只是不想见我父母。这有那么可怕吗？你不是也不想见你父亲吗！”

Once again, the image of himself in the future dominating his child like his own father had dominated him flashed in Shinji's mind. He suppressed the image, only to focus on his fiancé once more, a slightly anxious expression on her face. "What's wrong? You can talk to me about it if it really bothers you."  
又一次，未来自己像父亲曾经支配他那样支配孩子的画面在真嗣脑海中闪现。他压制住这个画面，重新将注意力集中在未婚妻身上，她脸上带着一丝焦虑。“怎么了？如果真的困扰你，可以和我谈谈。”

"It's nothing." "没什么。"

"No it's not." "不，不是的。"

"Really, don't worry about—"  
"真的，别担心——"

"Here you are just running away from your problems again. I thought you outgrew that, you idiot."  
"你又是在逃避问题。我以为你已经改掉了，你这个笨蛋。"

Frowning again, Shinji replied, distantly, "I'm just afraid I'll end up being just as good of a father as mine was."  
再次皱起眉头，真嗣遥远地回答道：“我只是害怕我会成为一个像我父亲那样糟糕的父亲。”

"How so?" "此话怎讲？"

"Well, I know I won't be nearly as bad of a dad as he was, I just can't shake the feeling that I'll somehow hurt my child, or maybe he'll hurt me alternatively because I'm afraid of hurting him. I don't know what to think, but I'm just afraid something bad will happen because I wouldn't know what to do."  
"嗯，我知道我不会像他那样糟糕地成为一个父亲，但我就是无法摆脱那种感觉，觉得我会在某种程度上伤害我的孩子，或者也许他会因为我害怕伤害他而反过来伤害我。我不知道该怎么想，我只是害怕会发生什么坏事，因为我不知道该怎么办。"

The redhead examined him with a raised eyebrow before drawing nearer. She lazily flicked him in the forehead, at which she snapped, "Dummkopf! You're stupider than I thought if that's what you're worried about being like that idiot."  
红发女子扬起眉毛打量着他，然后靠近了一些。她懒洋洋地弹了一下他的额头，随即厉声说道：“笨蛋！如果你担心变成那个白痴那样，那你可真是比我想的还要蠢。”

"How is it stupid? It's a very legitimate fear!"  
“这怎么蠢了？这是一个非常合理的担忧！”

"Well, tell me this: are you going to emotionally abandon your kid?"  
"那么，告诉我：你会不会在情感上抛弃你的孩子？"

"No."

"Are you going to make him pilot a gigantic robot?"  
"你会让他驾驶巨大的机器人吗？"

"I don't think so." "我不这么认为。"

"Are you going to focus on a creepy blue haired girl more than him?"  
"你打算把注意力更多地放在那个蓝头发的诡异女孩身上，而不是他吗？"

"Not likely." "不太可能。"

"Then you'll be fine. What're you worried about?" Asuka replied, sitting back on her bed, exhaling slowly as she muttered to herself, "But my mother, on the other hand…"  
"那你就不用担心了。你在担心什么呢？" 明日香回答道，坐回自己的床上，缓缓呼出一口气，喃喃自语，"但另一方面，我的母亲……"

"What was that?" "那是什么？"

"Nothing. I was just thinking about my mother—er, I mean, stepmother."  
"没什么。我只是在想我的母亲——呃，我是说，继母。"

"Oh, okay," Shinji replied, convinced, "I'm guessing you don't get along with her?"  
"哦，好吧，" 真嗣回答，信服了，"我猜你跟她相处得不太好？"

"Yeah, I suppose." "是啊，我想是的。"

"Do you want to talk about it?" Shinji asked.  
"你想谈谈这件事吗？" 真嗣问道。"

Smiling slyly, Asuka replied, "Dummkopf! If I started telling you everything wrong with me, then I'd really realize I'm in a pathetic state."  
阿斯卡狡黠地笑了笑，回答道："笨蛋！如果我开始告诉你我所有的错处，那我才会真正意识到自己有多可悲。"

"So I can tell you things, but not the other way around?"  
"所以我可以告诉你事情，反过来就不行？"

"Basically. Now go to bed. We have two weeks before we go to Hell."  
"基本上是这样。现在去睡觉吧。我们还有两周就要去地狱了。"

**Part 8 第八部分**

"Attention passengers, we will be landing in Germany in approximately 10 minutes. Thank you for flying—"  
女士们先生们，我们将在大约 10 分钟后降落在德国。感谢您的飞行——

"Thank God we're here! My butt is so damn sore!" Asuka groaned, pushing herself up as she massaged her rear end.  
"谢天谢地我们到了！我的屁股疼死了！" 明日香呻吟着，一边按摩着自己的臀部一边挣扎着站起来。

"I don't think you should be getting up right now," Shinji replied, glancing over at his fiancé with a mildly concerned expression.  
"我觉得你现在不该站起来，" 真嗣回答道，瞥了一眼他的未婚妻，脸上带着些许关切的表情。

"And why not, you id—" The airplane their were currently inside tossed slightly, knocking Asuka back onto her seat. After the momentary expression of shock faded away, she stammered, struggling to revive her self-importance, "Oh, if you didn't catch me off guard like that, I wouldn't have fallen like that! You idiot!"  
"为什么不行，你这个笨——" 他们所在的飞机轻轻颠簸了一下，把明日香又摔回了座位上。短暂的震惊表情过后，她结结巴巴地试图恢复自己的尊严，"哦，如果不是你让我措手不及，我才不会摔倒呢！你这个笨蛋！"

Frowning, Shinji glanced up at his redhead fiancé. There was a note of anxiety in her eyes, a note of terror that Shinji couldn't explain. Sure, the memories of their last visit to Germany was bad, but surely, SURELY, that couldn't be the only reason Asuka didn't want to go to Germany, to return to her parents. Surely there was something else, surely some other motivation holding her back, another memory, one that she refused to let him know.  
皱着眉头，真嗣抬头看向他的红发未婚妻。她的眼中流露出一丝焦虑，一丝真嗣无法解释的恐惧。确实，他们上次去德国的经历很糟糕，但肯定，肯定不会仅仅因为这个原因，明日香就不想回德国，不想回到她的父母身边。肯定还有别的原因，肯定有其他动机让她犹豫不前，有另一个她拒绝让他知道的记忆。

Why wasn't she letting him in? He let her in all the time, but now when something was personal for her, she refused to let him know anything. She had been acting agitated all day, shouting at him the entire way up to the airplane.  
为什么她不让他了解？他总是让她进入自己的内心，但现在当事情对她来说变得私人化时，她却拒绝透露任何信息。她一整天都表现得焦躁不安，从出发到登上飞机一路上都在对他大喊大叫。

#

"What are you? Stupid!? You need to get your passport!" Asuka had snapped at him, in a frustrated tone.  
“你到底怎么了？蠢吗？！快去拿你的护照！”明日香恼怒地对他吼道。

"Hang on! I'm just getting it out," Shinji had replied as the workers at the airport waited patiently for him to withdraw the document from his pant's pocket.  
"等等！我正把它拿出来，" 真嗣回答道，机场的工作人员耐心等待着他从裤袋里取出文件。

"Oh sure! Take your time, why don't you?" Asuka had groaned, shaking her head and tapping her feet in frustration, "You're taking too long! We're going to miss the plane if you take this up!"  
"哦，当然！慢慢来，为什么不呢？" 明日香叹了口气，摇头跺脚，显得很不耐烦，"你太慢了！再这样下去我们要赶不上飞机了！"

"Miss, you have another hour before your plane starts according to your ticket, so I think you can rest assured you'll arrive on time," the worker had said in an attempt to pacify the German.  
"小姐，根据您的机票，您的航班还有一个小时才开始，所以您可以放心，您会准时到达的，" 工作人员试图安抚这位德国女孩。

"Oh, shut up! What do you know?!"  
"哦，闭嘴！你知道什么？！"

"I work here." "我在这里工作。"

"I have the passport! Here you are," Shinji said, handing the pass to the workers.  
"我有护照！给你，" 真嗣说着，将护照递给了工作人员。

"Oh sure, took you long enough! Dummkopf! What were you doing that whole time? Playing with yourself?"  
"哦当然，你可真慢！笨蛋！你那段时间都在干嘛？自娱自乐吗？"

"Ma'am, that's uncalled for language," one of the coworkers had stammered, shocked by what she was saying.  
""女士，这种话不合适，"" 一位同事结结巴巴地说，对她的话感到震惊。

"Oh shut up! Let's go, you stupid—"  
"哦闭嘴！我们走，你这个蠢——"

"I'm sorry ma'am, but you forgot to show us any identification."  
"对不起，女士，但您忘记向我们出示任何身份证明了。"

"Scheiße! Bumsen Sie Sie und Ihren Paß!"  
"该死！去你的和你的护照！"

After flashing her passport hastily, Shinji had turned to the rest of the workers, and had mumbled, anxiously, "Uh, we're going to see her parents."  
在匆忙展示她的护照后，真嗣转向其他工作人员，紧张地咕哝道：“呃，我们要去见她的父母。”

#

And so, as the plane landed on German turf, Shinji watched Asuka rise from her seat, stretching her back as she snapped, "God damn air planes! These rides are too damn long. Why can't we just get Supersonic jets to bring us here?"  
"于是，当飞机降落在德国的土地上时，真嗣看着明日香从座位上站起来，伸了个懒腰，抱怨道：“该死的飞机！这些航程太他妈长了。为什么我们不能用超音速喷气机直接飞过来？””

"It's probably unhealthy for the baby," Shinji replied.  
“可能对宝宝不好，”真嗣回答。

"Oh, of course, Shinji here is a real protégée when it comes to babies! I don't see you getting pregnant!" Asuka snapped, placing a hand gingerly on the small bump on her torso, a slight convex bubble of life that was currently visible to the human eye. It wasn't large, and, to some, it might just look that Asuka had just put on a little bit of weight. And indeed, she had put on weight aside from the baby. Her arms and thighs had grown slightly thicker, though not enough to look even remotely overweight. It was just a little bit of fat, which was of course expected to form when a woman was pregnant.  
"“哦，当然了，真嗣在这方面可是个真正的天才！我可没见你怀孕！”明日香反唇相讥，小心翼翼地把手放在她腹部微微隆起的小包上，那是一个目前肉眼可见的生命迹象。它并不大，对某些人来说，可能只会觉得明日香稍微胖了点。确实，除了宝宝，她的手臂和大腿也略微变粗了，但还不至于显得肥胖。只是多了些脂肪，当然，这在怀孕的女性身上是预料之中的。”

As the couple walked, Shinji noticed, from the corner of his eyes, his fiancé stumble over a rather obviously placed cart. As she swore on the top of her lungs in German, Shinji wondered just why she hadn't noticed that thing there before. It wasn't out of sight or anything; it was right there. It was almost like walking headlong into a table or a wall. "Damn it," Asuka snapped, "Stupid toes! I knew I shouldn't of warn sandals to this stupid crapshoot of a country!"  
"当这对情侣走着时，真嗣从眼角注意到他的未婚妻绊到了一个相当显眼的推车上。她用德语大声咒骂，真嗣不禁疑惑她之前怎么没注意到那东西。它并不隐蔽，就在那里，几乎像是迎面撞上桌子或墙壁。“该死，”明日香怒道，“蠢脚趾！我就知道不该穿凉鞋来这个该死的国家！””

"Uh, Asuka, you need to relax a little—"  
“呃，明日香，你需要放松一点——”

"You shut up!" “你闭嘴！”

"Yes ma'am!" “是的，女士！”

After reaching the lobby of the airport, they found several people chattering in German. The cacophony was so disorienting that Shinji that he couldn't spot out the man holding a sign with their names on it a mere twenty feet away. His fiancé, irate and frustrated, grabbed him by the wrist, and pulled him toward the man standing their with that sign, clearly longing to be somewhere else, far away.  
到达机场大厅后，他们发现许多人在用德语交谈。嘈杂声如此令人迷失方向，以至于真嗣没有注意到那个拿着写有他们名字的牌子、仅在二十英尺外的人。他的未婚妻既生气又沮丧，抓住他的手腕，把他拉向那个拿着牌子、显然渴望远离此地的人。

"Dummkopf! What are you, stupid? Can't even see the sign when it's right in front of your eyes. You idiot!"  
“笨蛋！你是不是傻？连眼前的牌子都看不见。你这个白痴！”

"I'm sor—hey!" "对不起——嘿！"

"Stupid idiot! Moron! Ugh!"  
"笨蛋！白痴！呸！"

The couple arrived at the side of the German with the sign, who spoke rapidly in harsh, frustrated German. Shinji could pick up on what he was saying rather easily. "How long do you expect me to wait, anyway? Thank God you're here."  
这对夫妇来到了举着牌子的人身边，他用急促而沮丧的德语快速说着。真嗣很容易就能听懂他在说什么。“你到底要我等多久？谢天谢地你们终于来了。”

"I'm sorry," Shinji stammered, in broken German, only for Asuka to shoot him a dirty look. She was training him against saying "sorry" all the time.  
"对不起，" 真嗣结结巴巴地用德语说道，结果只换来明日香一个嫌弃的眼神。她正在训练他不要总是说"对不起"。

Turning to the man, Asuka said, in a snappy tone, "Look, it's your job to hold the sign, right?"  
转向那人，明日香用干脆的语气说道，"听着，举牌子是你的工作，对吧？"

"Right." "对。"

"So why're you complaining? You'll be paid overtime for your services, be able to buy your girlfriend a nice dress, whatever she wants. If you don't have a girl, then you'll just buy one. Knowing someone like you, that's probably the only way you'd get one with you people skills." The man struggled not to yell back as his lips twitched painfully. Shinji gave him credit for strength of will. "Good, now take us to the Langley Estate. Now."  
"那你为什么抱怨呢？你的加班费会有的，还能给你女朋友买件漂亮的裙子，她想要什么就买什么。如果你没有女朋友，那就去买一个。像你这样的人，估计也只有这个办法能找到女朋友了。" 那人努力不让自己吼回去，嘴唇痛苦地抽搐着。真嗣佩服他的意志力。"很好，现在带我们去兰利庄园。立刻。"

"Estate?" Shinji asked, "Are you rich or something?"  
"庄园？" 真嗣问道，"你很有钱吗？"

"Not specifically." "并不是特别有钱。"

"Then why call it an es—"  
"那为什么还叫它‘es—’"

"Right this way," the man groaned.  
"这边请，" 那人呻吟道。

The ride from the airport was relatively long. In fact, Shinji wondered why they couldn't have arrived in an airport at least slightly closer to their destination. The forty-five minute drive was insanely long, especially with Asuka grumpily complaining about everything they saw as they passed by the industrialized cities. "They've cut down all those trees? That's just stupid! I remember there being a forest here, with huge trees! I mean, I remember climbing them and hanging on the branches as a kid. Why did they cut them down? Probably to make way for some stupid freeway or city skyscraper! Those stupid idiots! It's the same in Japan, though, those crazy Japanese stupid—" Shinji sort of just found her complaining to be just white noise after awhile, especially with the driver's radio blasting in the background and planes soaring overhead, cars honking and trucks mowing along, animals crying and humans laughing on the outside.  
从机场出发的路程相当漫长。事实上，真嗣疑惑为什么他们不能选择一个至少离目的地稍近一些的机场。四十五分钟的驾驶时间长得离谱，尤其是明日香一路上对所见的一切都抱怨连连，当他们穿过工业化城市时。“他们把那些树都砍了？真是愚蠢！我记得这里曾有一片森林，有着参天大树！我小时候还爬过它们，挂在树枝上。他们为什么要砍掉？大概是为了给某个愚蠢的高速公路或城市摩天大楼让路！那些蠢货！不过日本也一样，那些疯狂的日本人真是—”真嗣渐渐觉得她的抱怨变成了背景中的白噪音，尤其是司机的收音机在背后轰鸣，飞机在头顶飞过，汽车鸣笛，卡车轰隆驶过，动物哀鸣，外面的人们欢笑。

After an eternity, the car pulled up to a massive driveway that lead up to what looked like a rather large estate, as Asuka had implied. Chances are the house was supplied to the Langley's from the government as a reward for raising a pilot who had fought hard to resist Instrumentality and the Angels. From what Shinji knew, Germany had held the pilots in high esteem. The NERV branch in Germany often received awards, as Fuyutsuki observed constantly. He seemed to envy their success.  
经过漫长的等待，车子终于驶入了一条宽阔的车道，通向一座看起来相当宏伟的庄园，正如明日香所暗示的那样。很可能这栋房子是政府作为奖励提供给 Langley 家的，以表彰他们培养出一位奋力抵抗使徒化和使徒的驾驶员。据真嗣所知，德国对这些驾驶员极为尊敬。德国的 NERV 分部经常获得奖项，这一点经常被冬月观察到。他似乎对他们的成功感到羡慕。

"Well, here we are," the driver said, a note of relief in his voice as he turned around to the couple. "I'll go get your backs."  
“好了，我们到了，”司机说道，声音中带着一丝轻松，他转过身来面对这对情侣。“我去帮你们拿行李。”

"Thank you very much," Shinji replied, waiting for Asuka to say something in response. However, by the time the man left the vehicle, she was still silent. Shinji turned toward his fiancé, and saw her staring out the window at the large building that was her home. It was a true mansion, with turrets and everything, beautiful brick walls constructing the elaborate building, gargoyles and other beautiful ornaments resting on the peeks of the several pointed roofs, decorating the stunning faces of the building. And yet the German didn't seem to notice this at all.  
“非常感谢，”真嗣回答道，等待着明日香回应些什么。然而，直到那人离开车子，她依然沉默不语。真嗣转向他的未婚妻，看到她正凝视着窗外，望着那座作为她家的大宅。那是一座真正的豪宅，有着塔楼和一切，精美的砖墙构建了这座复杂的建筑，石像鬼和其他美丽的装饰品点缀在多个尖顶的顶端，装饰着这座建筑令人惊叹的外观。然而，这位德国女孩似乎完全没有注意到这一切。

Why was Asuka white in the face?  
为什么明日香脸色苍白？

Why was she trembling? 为什么她在颤抖？

Why was she so cold?  
为什么她如此冰冷？

Shinji extended his hand, and pulled the redhead's into his, a concerned expression on his face. It had been years since she had last returned here. The post-Third Impact genocides and wars that broke out here had to be the least of the reasons for her not returning. Something else, something horrible, had happened here, something that happened in the house they were currently parked in front of. The German turned to make eye contact for a moment, a desperate look of longing in her eyes, unable to hide the desire for the Japanese boy to hug her, to hold her close, to tell he everything was going to be better. However, that sense of longing was soon swallowed up in a frustrated scowl, yet her narrowed eyes were unable to hide that melancholy gaze, the longing to be told she didn't need to leave the sanctuary of the vehicle, that she could just remain here for an eternity, away from the unknown fears of the house.  
真嗣伸出手，将红发女孩的手拉入自己的手中，脸上带着关切的表情。自从她上次回到这里已经过去多年。第三次冲击后的种族灭绝和战争爆发，这些都不是她不回来的主要原因。还有别的事情，可怕的事情，发生在这里，就在他们现在停在前面的房子里。德国女孩转过头来，眼神中流露出渴望，无法掩饰她希望日本男孩拥抱她、紧紧抱住她、告诉她一切都会好起来的愿望。然而，这种渴望很快被一个沮丧的皱眉所吞没，尽管她眯起的眼睛无法隐藏那忧郁的目光，那种渴望被告诉她不需要离开车辆的庇护，可以永远留在这里，远离房子未知的恐惧。

"What're you doing?" she spat, in a venomous tone, "Dummkopf! Stop looking at me like that!"  
“你在干什么？”她带着毒辣的语气说道，“笨蛋！别那样看着我！”

"Are you alright?" “你还好吗？”

"Alright? What's wrong with you? Why would it look like I'm not alright, anyway?"  
"没事吧？你哪里不对劲？反正怎么会看起来我不行呢？"

"Well—" "嗯——"

"Are you two going to get out of the car yet?!"  
"你们俩还不打算下车吗？！"

Asuka scowled at the driver, who was currently holding Asuka's entire cornucopia of bags on his back, and holding onto Shinji's single suitcase in his hand. "Jesus! Can't you be a little patient?"  
明日香对司机皱起了眉头，司机此刻正背着明日香那一整袋的行李，手里还提着真嗣的一个手提箱。"天哪！你就不能稍微耐心点吗？"

"Patient? Lady, you're impossible!"  
“有耐心？女士，你简直不可理喻！”

Shinji exited the car, holding the door open for her fiancé to follow. Any ordinary human would probably just leave the hotheaded redhead to her own devices, not really caring if she left the car at all, maybe hoping she didn't. For better or worse, Shinji wasn't an ordinary human being. He could see the pain the German was struggling to conceal. He knew her long enough to know that she was at her bitchiest when she was stressed out. Clearly something was stressing her out to near the breaking point. He knew better than to get in her way, but he also knew that it was best to be as nice as possible to the redhead, to treat her like a Princess in order to remind her that someone did care for her.  
真嗣下了车，为她未婚妻扶着车门。换作普通人，可能会任由那位脾气火爆的红发女子自行其是，并不真正在意她是否下车，甚至可能希望她别下车。但无论好坏，真嗣并非普通人。他能看出那位德国女孩正竭力掩饰的痛苦。他认识她够久了，知道她在压力山大时会变得格外刻薄。显然有什么事让她几乎到了崩溃的边缘。他知道最好不要挡她的路，但他也明白，对这位红发女子尽可能地温柔以待，像对待公主一样对待她，以提醒她有人在乎她，这是最好的办法。

Usually that worked. 通常这招很管用。

He hoped it would now.  
他希望现在会是这样。

Asuka hopped out of the vehicle, her gaze averted from all. She brushed a hand over her forehead, as though she were wiping sweat away. However, seeing as how it was reaching the month of December, and seeing as how Third Impact hard returned the Earth to its pre-Second Impact climate conditions, it was certainly rather chilly outside. However, only Shinji, standing beside the girl, could see the redhead's thumb brush against the corners of her eyes ever so slightly, so that the chauffeur behind them would be unable to see her brush aside the tears she cried.  
明日香从车里跳了出来，目光避开所有人。她用手拂过额头，仿佛在擦汗。然而，既然已经接近十二月，而且第三次冲击已经将地球恢复到第二次冲击前的气候条件，外面的确相当寒冷。不过，只有站在女孩身边的真嗣能看到红发少女的拇指轻轻拂过眼角，这样司机就看不到她擦去泪水了。

Shinji reached out for his fiancé, putting a hand on her shoulder, a reassuring hand that he hoped would relay the message to her, through her layers of pride and fuming frustration, that he was here for her. For a moment, all was still, much to the chauffeur's shock. However, after five seconds, the German girl brushed his hand aside, and mumbled, "I'm fine. Don't worry about me, you stupid idiot." With that, she took several steps closer to the house, her head lowered in resignation.  
真嗣伸手去触碰他的未婚妻，将手放在她的肩上，一只充满安慰的手，他希望这能透过她的层层骄傲和愤怒传递给她，他在这里支持她。有那么一刻，一切都静止了，这让司机大吃一惊。然而，五秒钟后，德国女孩推开了他的手，低声说：“我没事。别担心我，你这个笨蛋。”说完，她向房子走近了几步，头低垂着，显得有些无奈。

"She's your fiancé, right?" the chauffeur mumbled behind Shinji.  
"她是你的未婚妻，对吧？" 司机在真嗣身后咕哝道。

"Yeah, she is." "是的，她是。"

"Uh-huh. If you don't mind me saying so, she's a complete bitch, but she has one sexy ass."  
"嗯哼。恕我直言，她是个十足的婊子，但她有个火辣的屁股。"

Shinji didn't need to defend his fiancé; she happened to turn around on the spot and throw a rock at him. It missed, but the man got the hint rather quickly, and shut his mouth.  
真嗣不需要为他的未婚妻辩护；她恰好原地转身，朝他扔了一块石头。虽然没打中，但那男人很快就明白了意思，闭上了嘴。

"Stupid idiots! I just hate stupid men!"  
“愚蠢的白痴！我就是讨厌愚蠢的男人！”

The trio, the chauffeur trailing behind with the added weight on his back, ascended a large stairway leading up to a pair of large oak doors. This was the threshold of the Langley estate, and now his fiancé was about to reunite with her parents for the first time in perhaps a decade; maybe more. Surely there was only one possible outcome for all this: a lot of problems.  
三人组，司机背着额外的重量跟在后面，登上了一座通往一对巨大橡木门的大楼梯。这里是兰格利庄园的门槛，现在他的未婚妻即将与她的父母重逢，或许是十年来的第一次；甚至更久。毫无疑问，这一切只有一个可能的结果：很多问题。

Asuka wrapped her knuckles against the door, and Shinji held his breath, waiting for the moment where all hell would break lose. Finally, however, the door opened, and, to Shinji's mild surprise, a 14 year old emerged from the depths of the house. The lithe child there before them had long strawberry blonde hair that trailed over her back in the form of two pigtails. Her sky blue eyes gazed up into Asuka's own eyes of the same color, and the two stared at one another for a few moments. Finally, the younger girl smiled. "Sis?"  
明日香用指节敲了敲门，真嗣屏住呼吸，等待着即将爆发的混乱时刻。然而，门终于打开了，让真嗣略感惊讶的是，一个十四岁的女孩从屋子的深处走了出来。站在他们面前的这个纤细的孩子，有着一头长长的草莓金色头发，扎成两条辫子垂在背后。她那湛蓝的眼睛与明日香同样颜色的眼睛对视着，两人凝视彼此片刻。最终，小女孩笑了。“姐姐？”

"Kate? That you?" Asuka asked, nonchalantly in a surprisingly comfortable tone, "You've grown."  
“凯特？是你吗？”明日香以一种出乎意料轻松的语气问道，“你长高了。”

"Uh-huh, and not just my height. My figure's spilled out as well, you know," Kate replied.  
“嗯哼，不只是身高，我的身材也丰满了不少，你知道的。”凯特回答道。

"Yup, that's her sister," Shinji mumbled, positive that Asuka had said something similar to that when he had first met her.  
“嗯，那是她姐姐，”真嗣咕哝着，确信当初第一次见到明日香时，她说过类似的话。

At the sound of Shinji's voice, Kat took a few steps forward, gazing at her future brother-in-law, examining him through narrowed eyes before mumbling, in a lackluster tone, "That's him? The Third Child? He's kinda plain lookin', don't ya think?"  
听到真嗣的声音，凯特向前走了几步，盯着她未来的姐夫，眯起眼睛打量了一番，然后用无精打采的语气咕哝道：“就是他？第三适格者？看起来挺普通的，你不觉得吗？”

"Kate, please, remember that appearances aren't everything when it comes to true romance." At once, Shinji noticed, from the corner of his eye, Asuka jump suddenly and sharply, as though ice had been applied to the back of her neck. She gazed at the woman standing in the doorway, and, as her eyes grew wide, Shinji followed their trail to the woman standing there before them. She was an icy looking blonde, her hair all wrapped up into an elaborate high bun. Her pale skin complemented her green eyes, which was in stark contrast to her daughter's eyes or her step-daughter's. She looked older, like in her late forties or early fifties, and yet was rather beautiful in her aged state. Shinji was sure she was quite a looker even ten years prior, maybe a rival to Asuka. That being said, there was a chill about the woman he just couldn't place, but he knew he didn't like it.  
“凯特，请记住，真正的浪漫并不仅仅关乎外表。” 瞬间，真嗣注意到，从眼角余光中，明日香突然猛地一跳，仿佛脖颈后被冰块触碰一般。她凝视着站在门口的女人，随着她的眼睛睁大，真嗣顺着她的视线望向站在那里的女人。她是一位冷艳的金发女郎，头发高高盘成一个复杂的发髻。她苍白的肌肤与绿色的眼睛相得益彰，与她女儿或继女的眼睛形成鲜明对比。她看起来年长，大约四五十岁，但在她这个年纪依然相当美丽。真嗣确信她十年前也一定是个美人，或许能与明日香匹敌。尽管如此，这位女士身上有一种他无法言明的寒意，但他知道他并不喜欢这种感觉。

Asuka, however, looked like she was beaming. "Hello, mother!"  
然而，明日香看起来却像是容光焕发。“你好，妈妈！”

"My dear step-daughter, I haven't seen you in ages." The mother approached her stepdaughter, and pulled her into a deep embrace. The German girl returned the favor, but only after a second passed after the gesture had been initiated. The hug, though, was surprisingly brief, and the two woman began laughing amongst themselves. "I see you've grown out your hair, and your body has grown into that of an eloquent young lady."  
"亲爱的继女，好久不见了。" 母亲走向她的继女，将她紧紧拥入怀中。德国女孩稍作迟疑，片刻后才回应这个拥抱。然而，这个拥抱出乎意料地短暂，两人随即相视而笑。"看来你留长了头发，身体也长成了一个优雅的年轻女士。"

"Lady? I don't know if I'm that great. I'd figure I'm still a girl physically."  
"女士？我不确定自己是否配得上这个称呼。我觉得在身体上我还是个女孩。"

"You look like a woman ready to be married. And this is my future son-in-law, correct?" Shinji hated when adults used the word "correct" when they could just use "right." "Correct" reminded him of his father.  
"你看起来就像个准备好结婚的女人。这位就是我未来的女婿，对吧？" 真嗣讨厌大人们用"对吧"这个词，他们完全可以直接说"对"。"对吧"总让他想起他的父亲。

"Yeah, that's right," Shinji said, putting a surprising emphasis on the "right."  
"没错，" 真嗣说道，对"没错"这个词意外地加重了语气。

"Well, I'm glad my daughter chose to marry such an important individual such as yourself," Asuka's stepmother said, a smile on her face, "I always knew she was destined for greatness, but to see her now to wed another one of this planet's saviors, I justfeel faint thinking of it. You must tell us everything over dinner tonight. Mr. Langley, as it were, is currently out on business, but should return tomorrow."  
"我很高兴我的女儿选择了像您这样重要的人物结婚，" 明日香的后妈说道，脸上带着微笑，"我一直知道她注定会成就非凡，但看到她现在与另一位地球的救星结婚，我一想到这就感到头晕。今晚晚餐时，您一定要告诉我们所有的事情。拉格纳先生目前因公外出，但预计明天会回来。"

"Oh, that's fine. Don't worry," Asuka replied, smiling, "Might be good for some catching up, right?"  
"哦，那没关系。别担心，" 明日香笑着回答，"也许是个叙旧的好机会，对吧？"

"Correct," Asuka's stepmother replied, "By the way, Shinji, was it?"  
"没错，" 明日香的继母回答道，"顺便问一下，你是真嗣，对吧？"

"That's right." "是的。"

"Well, I would just like to know that if there is anything, and I mean anything, we can do to make your stay at our cozy little estate all the more enjoyable, please, do not hesitate to let us know."  
"那么，我想知道，如果有任何事情——我是说任何事情——我们能做的，来让你的逗留在我们这温馨的小庄园更加愉快，请务必不要犹豫，告诉我们。"

"Alright, I won't," Shinji replied, not trusting that woman for more than a second.  
"好吧，我不会的，" 真嗣回答道，对那个女人连一秒钟的信任都没有。

"Hey, lady, where do you want me to dump your crap?" the chauffeur mumbled under the weight of the bags.  
"嘿，女士，你想让我把你的东西扔哪儿？" 司机在袋子的重压下咕哝着。

Asuka glanced over at him, nonchalantly. "Oh, you? Dump them in wherever I'm staying. Uh, where is that again?"  
明日香瞥了他一眼，漫不经心地说："哦，你？把它们扔到我住的地方。呃，那地方是哪儿来着？"

"Third floor, first room on the right after you walk up the stairs," the stepmother replied, nonchalantly to the chauffeur.  
"三楼，上楼梯后右手边第一间房，"继母漫不经心地对司机说道。

"Thanks a lot," the man, clearly happy to drop the load off, darted toward the doorway.  
"非常感谢，"那男人显然很高兴能卸下这负担，急忙朝门口走去。

"Do you need any help?" Shinji asked the man, but his voice was drowned out by Asuka's voice.  
"需要帮忙吗？"真嗣向那人问道，但他的声音被明日香的声音淹没了。

"Hey guys, can we go get some water please? We're kinda parched," Asuka shouted, overwhelming Shinj's statement so the chauffeur couldn't hear him, couldn't hear his possible means from leaving he alone with her parents, Shinji assumed.  
"嘿，伙计们，我们能去弄点水吗？我们都快渴死了，" 明日香大声喊道，盖过了真嗣的话，司机听不见他的可能的借口，无法听到他可能的借口，让他独自和她父母在一起，真嗣猜测。

"Certainly. Kate will guide you there herself, won't you, Kate?"  
"当然可以。凯特会亲自带你们去，对吧，凯特？"

"Of course! Right this way."  
"当然！这边请。"

"Thanks a lot! Shinji, come with me!" Asuka grabbed Shinji by the wrist and, against his will, dragged him away from the spot, along with her, ensuring that, no matter where she went, he wasn't going anywhere more than five feet away from her in this house.  
“真是太感谢了！真嗣，跟我来！”明日香抓住真嗣的手腕，不顾他的意愿，将他拖离了原地，带着他一起走，确保无论她走到哪里，他都不会在这房子里离她超过五英尺。

This was going to be one long visit, wasn't it?  
这趟拜访会很长，不是吗？
