What you are about to read is in no way connected to my previous Fan-Fiction, "In the Case of Asuka Langley Sohryu," which I still recommend you read because, in my opinion, I think it touches upon a certain aspect of the series that people usually don't touch upon: why don't these damn kids just get psychologists to help them with their problems? Well, that not withstanding, I've wanted to find fan-fics where Asuka and Shinji finally confront the horrors of parenthood, and considering just what their parents were like, one having a rather cold and distant father and the other's mother committing suicide in front of her eyes, it left much potential not only to do a great Asuka fan-fic, but also a great Shinji fan-fic as well. Naturally, considering the subject matter, there will be several OCs, but they'll mostly be children.  
你即将阅读的内容与我之前的同人小说《浅谈惣流·明日香·兰格雷的个案》并无任何关联，我仍推荐你阅读，因为在我看来，它触及了该系列中人们通常不涉及的一个方面：这些孩子为何不寻求心理学家帮助解决他们的问题？尽管如此，我一直想找到关于明日香和真嗣最终直面育儿恐怖的同人作品，考虑到他们的父母分别是怎样的人——一个有着冷漠疏离的父亲，另一个的母亲则在眼前自杀，这不仅为创作一部优秀的明日香同人提供了广阔空间，也为真嗣同人开辟了同样广阔的可能性。当然，鉴于主题，会有一些原创角色，但大部分会是孩子。

WARNING: Despite being rated T, there is a very mild, PG-13 level sex scene in the next chapter. This is not a lemon, not a hentai, and the sex will barely count as ecchi. It's more essentially to show the beauty of the human body, and just how two certain characters get into this situation in the first place. If you feel uncomfortable about it, gloss over it. If you're into that sort of stuff, like lemons, I'm sorry, but I want this to reach the general audience.  
警告：尽管评级为 T，下一章中包含一个非常温和的 PG-13 级别性爱场景。这不是柠檬文，不是 hentai，性爱内容几乎算不上是 ecchi。其主要目的是展现人体之美，以及两位特定角色是如何陷入这种情境的。如果你对此感到不适，可以选择略过。如果你喜欢柠檬文这类内容，很抱歉，但我希望这部作品能面向更广泛的读者。

So, without further adieu…  
那么，不再多说……

### **THE LITTLE ANGEL 小天使**

**BY DA GAMES ELITE 由游戏精英创作**

**Part 1 第一部分**

"I mustn't run away, I mustn't run away, I mustn't—"  
“我绝不能逃跑，我绝不能逃跑，我绝不能——”

"Shut up, please." 请闭嘴。

"Sorry." "对不起。"

Usually those were lines spoken by her, telling him to shut up, that he was being annoying, that this stupid habit of his, that fallback on muttering that same mantra to calm his nerves was just immature, irritating, and, once again, stupid. However, for better or worse, the adult known as Shinji Ikari glanced over at the tense individual sitting next to him, a man he had known for over ten years, through the tough times and the bad, a man who was now in both an enviable situation and a pitiful one: Toji Suzuhara.  
通常这些话都是她对他说的，让他闭嘴，说他烦人，他这个愚蠢的习惯，总是用那句咒语来平复自己的紧张情绪，既幼稚又恼人，而且，又一次，愚蠢。然而，不管是好是坏，成年人真嗣一瞥向坐在他旁边紧张兮兮的那个人，一个他认识超过十年的人，经历了艰难和糟糕的时光，一个现在处于令人羡慕和可怜境地的人：铃原东治。

Years ago, Shinji had watched Toji being ripped apart before his eyes. Well, his Eva being ripped apart, anyway, by Shinji's own Unit-01. That had been almost another life time ago. If you saw Toji know, while you wouldn't think he was in the best of health considering the circumstances, he certainly didn't look like a dismembered devastated wreck. His arms had been replaced with metallic, robotic ones. In the early years following Third Impact, they had looked cartoonish, like something out of a sci-fi film. Just plain metal, unhidden, with long wires and bolts clear to the naked eye. Now, however, thanks to the leaps and bounds of technology, and just the leaps and bounds the world had gone through since Third Impact overall, Toji's mechanical arms, while they occasionally made a buzzing sound every so often due to maybe a loose bolt or a tangled up wire, looked like ordinary appendages, skin, muscle fiber, everything.  
多年前，真嗣曾亲眼目睹了 Toji 被撕裂的场景。确切地说，是他的 Eva 被真嗣自己的初号机撕裂。那仿佛是另一个时代的事了。如今若见到 Toji，尽管考虑到他的经历，你不会认为他身体状况良好，但他绝不像一个肢体残缺、精神崩溃的人。他的双臂已被金属机械臂所替代。在第三次冲击后的最初几年，这些机械臂看起来颇为滑稽，像是科幻电影中的道具，裸露的金属材质，长长的电线和螺栓清晰可见。然而，随着科技的飞速进步，以及第三次冲击后世界整体的巨大变迁，Toji 的机械臂如今已与常人无异，偶尔因松动的螺栓或缠绕的电线发出轻微的嗡鸣声，但其外观已完全模拟了皮肤、肌肉纤维等人体组织。

However, like Shinji said, none of this kept Toji from looking like a broken down wreck right now. Sweat was billowing down his forehead; his hair was in the air because of him ruffling it, tugging at it, anxiously twisting in spite of himself. His eyes were bloodshot, probably because he hadn't had a good night's sleep in the last few days, once again due to circumstance. This lack of sleep also contributed to the black bags he wore under his eyes, the bags that sacked down, and made him look as though he were twenty years older than what he really was: a man at the age of 26.  
然而，正如真嗣所说，这一切都没能让东治看起来不像个支离破碎的废人。汗水正从他的额头滚滚而下；他的头发因为不断抓挠、拉扯，焦虑地扭动而竖立着。他的眼睛布满血丝，很可能是因为他已经好几天没能好好睡上一觉了，这又是环境所迫。这种睡眠不足也导致了他的眼下挂着黑眼圈，那些眼袋下垂，让他看起来仿佛比实际年龄大了二十岁：一个 26 岁的男人。

He looked, for all intents and purposes, like a damn zombie!  
从各方面来看，他简直就像个该死的僵尸！

And Shinji could do nothing about it.  
而真嗣对此无能为力。

"Hey," Shinji mumbled, anxiously wriggling his fingers as he glanced over at Toji, "Do you want me to get you a drink or something? You look like you could use—"  
"嘿，" 真嗣咕哝着，焦虑地扭动着手指，同时瞥向东治，"你要不要我给你拿点喝的？你看起来好像需要——"

"I'm fine, thanks," Toji replied, staring up at the door he had been staring at, waiting in front of, for the last several hours.  
"我没事，谢谢，" 东治回答道，抬头盯着他已经盯着、等待了几个小时的门。

"Are you sure? Listen, she'll be fine, just—"  
"你确定吗？听着，她会没事的，只是——"

"Get yourself a drink. You could use it," Toji replied, glancing over at his friend for a moment.  
“去给自己弄点喝的吧，你正需要这个。” 冬二回答道，目光短暂地瞥向他的朋友。

This was true. In spite of himself, Shinji too looked exhausted. Extremely so.  
这话不假。尽管自己不愿承认，真嗣也显得疲惫不堪。极其疲惫。

Shinji walked down the hospital ward, away from the bench where Toji and their other long time friend Kensuke sat. As he rose, Shinji noticed that Kensuke was actually sound asleep, leaning against the white, cold wall of the hospital hallway. No doubt his job as a military tactician had long hours and lots of stress, so Shinji thought, out of the three of them, HE'D be the one awake, the most calm. But no, he was currently comatose, asleep against the wall, drooling a little bit. His thick brown hair was pressed between his skull and the wall, his usually pasty skin wasn't any more or less pasty than it usually was, his small, slim frame didn't look nearly as exhausted as Toji's large, muscular frame did.  
真嗣沿着医院病房走去，远离了冬二和他们的另一位老朋友健介所坐的长椅。当他起身时，真嗣注意到健介实际上正熟睡着，靠在医院走廊那冰冷的白墙上。毫无疑问，作为军事战术家的工作时长和压力都很大，所以真嗣原以为，在他们三人中，健介会是那个保持清醒、最为镇定的人。但事实并非如此，他此刻正昏昏沉沉地靠在墙上，嘴角还流着口水。他浓密的棕发被压在头骨和墙壁之间，他那通常苍白的皮肤并没有比平时更苍白或更不苍白，他那瘦小的身躯看起来远没有冬二那魁梧的身躯那般疲惫。

"I'll be right back. I just need to use the bathroom a little bit," Shinji replied.  
"我马上回来。只是需要稍微去一下洗手间，" 真嗣回答道。

"Take your time. I'm sure nothing will happen for at least another half-hour," Toji replied, in that tense, strained voice of his.  
"慢慢来。我敢肯定至少还有半小时不会发生什么事，" 东治回答道，声音紧张而勉强。

It bothered Shinji just to see his friend this upset. He'd known him for years, he reflected as he walked down the hallway to whatever destination he intended at arriving at. He'd known him before and after the nightmare known as Third Impact, just like he'd known Kensuke, Hikari, and—  
看到朋友如此心烦意乱，真嗣感到不安。他回想起他们多年的友情，以及在被称为第三次冲击的噩梦前后的点点滴滴，就像他认识剑介、光和——

Where was she, anyway? Where was that German girl? Didn't she realize what her friend was going through right now? What was Shinji saying? Of course she did. She had been the one who had called him last night to tell him to move his ass and arrive at the hospital ASAP. Of course, she had been far harsher with that spitfire tongue of hers, but, in all honesty, Shinji could tell she was worried, concerned, maybe even a little afraid for her friend. This was supposed to be one of the best moments of Toji's life, of Hikari's life, and yet it was proving to be one of the longest, most drawn out periods of stress Shinji had experienced in the last five or six years.  
她到底在哪里？那个德国女孩呢？她难道不知道她朋友现在正经历着什么吗？真嗣在说什么？当然，她肯定知道。昨晚就是她打电话给他，让他赶紧动身，尽快赶到医院。当然，她那火爆的舌头说得更严厉，但说实话，真嗣能感觉到她的担忧，关心，或许还有点为她朋友担心。这本应是剑介一生中最美好的时刻，也是光一生中最美好的时刻，然而现在却成了真嗣过去五六年里经历的最漫长、最紧张的时刻之一。

Nothing next to the pain he felt during that nightmarish day, though.  
尽管如此，没有什么能比得上那个噩梦般的日子里他所感受到的痛苦。

Nothing like the Hell that was Third Impact.  
没有什么能比得上第三次冲击的地狱。

He had to stop reflecting on that day! Third Impact had occurred over a decade ago! It was over, finished! It was a nightmare he was never going to need to relive again, those first three years of utter chaos, the first seven months where he and Asuka remained alone, struggling to survive, wondering if anyone would ever return, the next year seeing civilization struggle to return to normalcy, and, for the rest of the immediate aftermath of Third Impact, watch the nation crumble apart before the remnants of NERV decided to put things in order. The horrors of finding people's starving bodies on the ground in heaps, of seeing people slaughtered in genocide, of being held a prisoner in questioning booths and concentration camps, it was all in the past! All in the damn past!  
他不得不停止回想那一天！第三次冲击已经过去十多年了！一切都结束了，完结了！那是一场他再也不需要重温的噩梦，最初的三年完全混乱，前七个月他和明日香孤立无援，挣扎求生，不知道是否还会有人回来，接下来的一年里，文明努力恢复正常，而在第三次冲击的余波中，眼看着国家分崩离析，直到 NERV 的残余力量决定恢复秩序。那些在街头发现成堆饿死的人们，目睹种族灭绝中的屠杀，被囚禁在审讯亭和集中营里的恐怖经历，都已成为过去！全都他妈的过去了！

Finding himself in front of a sink in the blue-tiled bathroom of this hospital, Shinji threw water against his face, rubbing it clean as he realized the absurdity of what he was saying. All in the past? That was just stupid, as Asuka would always say! He knew that those events had affected him on a deeper level, yes, and that he could never change them. The world he lived in now was drastically affected by those days. All he could do now was hope for a better tomorrow, and, with all that had been going on in the last few years, things had been better.  
发现自己站在医院蓝色瓷砖的洗手间前，真嗣将水泼向脸庞，揉搓着洗净，同时意识到自己所说的话有多荒谬。一切都过去了？那真是愚蠢，就像明日香常说的那样！他知道那些事件在他内心深处留下了影响，是的，他永远无法改变它们。他现在生活的世界深受那些日子的影响。他现在能做的就是期待一个更好的明天，而且，在过去的几年里，事情确实有所好转。

As Shinji left the bathroom, he heard a voice crack as it shouted his name. He glanced over his shoulder, only to see a pair of arms wrap themselves around his face, smothering him in a pair of thick breasts, strangling him, choking the life out of him. He turned blue in a matter of moments, barely able to pull away from that restrictive bear hug only to find, to his utter astonishment, fused of course with utter delight, Misato Katsuragi—er—Misato Hyuga, a woman who had been more a mother to him than even the woman named Yui Ikari, who now was somewhere in the depths of space, perhaps gone forever from Shinji's life.  
当真嗣离开洗手间时，他听到一个声音嘶哑地喊着他的名字。他回头一看，只见一双胳膊紧紧地抱住他的脸，用一对丰满的胸部将他闷住，勒得他喘不过气来。他很快就脸色发青，几乎无法挣脱那个束缚的熊抱，结果却发现，当然也带着无比的惊喜，是美里·卡苏拉吉——呃——美里·日向，这个女人对他来说比名为唯·碇的女人更像母亲，而唯·碇现在可能在太空深处，也许永远离开了真嗣的生活。

Shinji didn't like thinking about that. After all, here was Misato! Don't think about the past, the present! Here! Now! Misato!  
真嗣不喜欢去想那些事。毕竟，眼前是美里啊！别去想过去，别去想现在！就在这里！就在此刻！美里！

Somehow, this didn't cheer him up much at all.  
不知为何，这丝毫没有让他感到振奋。

"Oh, Shinji! I've missed you so—hey, what's wrong?" Misato asked, finally drawing back from her heart-felt, and in Shinji's case boob felt, greeting, only to notice that the recipient of the hug, or perhaps victim would be the better term, wasn't nearly as happy as she was. "Are you stressed about Hikari? Don't be. She'll be fine. It'll all turn out for the best in the end, so don't worry about a thing."  
“哦，真嗣！我好想你——嘿，怎么了？”美里终于从她那发自内心的，对真嗣来说则是胸部感受的问候中退开，这才注意到拥抱的接受者，或许用受害者更恰当，并没有像她那样开心。“你是在担心光吗？别担心。她会没事的。一切最终都会好起来的，所以别担心。”

Shinji, in his flashback, had almost forgotten about the reason he was in this damn, ice cold hospital in the first place. Shaking the cobwebs out of his head, he replied, in a strained voice, "Oh, I'm fine, don't worry."  
在回忆中，真嗣几乎忘记了最初自己为何会在这该死的、冰冷的医院里。他摇摇头驱散思绪，用略显沙哑的声音回答：“哦，我没事，别担心。”

Misato glanced at him critically, and, for the first time in awhile, Shinji had a good look at the woman who had helped raise him before and after—don't think of it, don't think of it, don't think of it! Well, avoiding that thing that would cause him to regress once again into a painful reflection, Misato had aged slightly. Her face had developed slight laugh lines in the ten years past—Damn it! Don't think that way!—that day. Her hair had even developed one or two gray hairs that she seemed to have forgotten, conveniently enough, to dye. Additionally, it looked like her drinking had caught up to her in some degree, as her body now looked slightly puffier than it had last, as though a thin deposit of fat had grown all over her body. Still, to the ordinary person who hadn't known Misato in her heyday, she was quite a knock-out, especially for an older woman.  
美里用审视的目光看了他一眼，而真嗣也难得有机会仔细打量这位在他成长过程中一直照顾他的女性——别想了，别想了，别想了！好吧，避开那个会让他再次陷入痛苦回忆的念头，美里确实有些变化。她的脸上多了几道笑纹，那是过去十年间留下的痕迹——该死！别这么想！那天之后。她的头发里也冒出了一两根白发，她似乎忘了染发。此外，她的饮酒习惯似乎也开始显现影响，身体看起来比上次见面时略显臃肿，仿佛全身都长了一层薄薄的脂肪。不过，对于那些不熟悉美里年轻时风采的普通人来说，她依然是个美人，尤其是对于一位年长的女性而言。

Shinji never thought he'd call Misato an older woman, ever.  
真嗣从未想过自己会称美里为年长的女性。

"You know, Shinji, when you say 'I'm fine' that just screams out how damn upset you really are, but I'll let that one slide," Misato replied, a small grin on her lips, "Look, I know how you must feel. I mean, Makoto went through the same thing with me when I had Yumi." Misato rested a hand absentmindedly on her torso, as though she could still feel the fetus kicking inside of her. "And he went through the same thing with Ryouji." She added, on a gentler note.  
"你知道吗，真嗣，当你说‘我没事’的时候，那简直就是在尖叫你有多么难过，不过这次我就放过你吧，"美里回答道，嘴角带着一丝微笑，"听着，我知道你现在的感受。我是说，诚在优米出生时也经历了同样的事情。"美里不经意地把手放在腹部，仿佛还能感觉到胎儿在里面踢动。"他和谅司也经历了同样的事情。"她补充道，语气更加温柔。

"Uh, where are your children, anyway? Are they with Makoto?"  
"呃，你的孩子们呢？他们和诚在一起吗？"

"Yeah, I mean, he wanted to come, believe me, but someone needed to watch the kids, and he knew I would probably be better emotional support for you guys, so he sent me." Misato added a little laugh at the end, as though to assure Shinji she was fine and happy that she was arriving to this event alone, but Shinji knew differently.  
"是的，我是说，他本来也想来，相信我，但总得有人照顾孩子，而且他知道我可能会是你们更好的情感支持，所以他让我来了。"美里在结尾处加了一点笑声，似乎是为了向真嗣保证她很好，很高兴独自来参加这个活动，但真嗣知道事实并非如此。

Still, he didn't bring it up.  
然而，他并未提及此事。

"So, uh, do you want to come back with us? We're just sitting there, waiting."  
"那么，呃，你想跟我们回去吗？我们只是坐在那里，等着。"

"Okay, that's fine," Misato replied, nodding as the two of them went off to the hospital ward where Toji and Kensuke were. As they walked together, Misato glanced around the hospital, in mild awe, as though the cold interior of this place were something out of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. After a few minutes of glancing around at the occasional hanging picture of a flower or of a random historical figure who had done something special in the field of medicine, she asked, "Is this the hospital that Maya's in charge of?"  
"好的，没关系，" 美里回答道，点头示意两人前往医院病房，那里有真治和健介。他们并肩而行，美里环顾医院四周，带着些许敬畏，仿佛这冰冷的内部环境是出自威利旺卡巧克力工厂的奇景。几分钟后，她不时瞥向偶尔悬挂的花卉画或某位在医学领域有特殊贡献的历史人物肖像，问道："这是玛雅负责的医院吗？"

"Huh? Oh, yeah, she does."  
"嗯？哦，对，她是这样。"

"Oh, that's nice." "哦，那挺好的。"

"Yeah, it is." "是啊，确实不错。"

An awkward silence filled the time period following this statement. For a moment, the two individuals simply walked down the hallway, until Shinji asked, curiously, "Does Makoto have any news on whether—"  
这句话之后，一阵尴尬的沉默弥漫开来。有那么一会儿，两人只是默默地走在走廊上，直到真嗣好奇地问道：“真琴有没有关于是否——的消息？”

"We don't know where Ritsuko is yet," Misato replied, frowning slightly. She glanced over at her side, at the ground by her feet. "And we haven't found—haven't found—"  
“我们还不知道律子在哪里，”美里回答，微微皱眉。她瞥了一眼身旁，目光落在脚边的地面上。“而且我们还没找到——还没找到——”

"Uh, Misato, we're here," Shinji said, gesturing toward Toji as he remained huddled on a bench, with Kensuke slowly rousing himself from slumber land. Rubbing the sleep from his eyes, Kensuke Aida glanced up, noticing Misato for the first time.  
“呃，美里，我们到了，”真嗣说着，指向仍然蜷缩在长椅上的冬二，以及正慢慢从睡梦中醒来的健介。揉着惺忪的睡眼，相田健介抬起头，第一次注意到美里。

"Misato! Good morning!" Kensuke stammered, rising to his feet and bowing slightly.  
“美里！早上好！” 真嗣结结巴巴地说着，站起身来微微鞠了一躬。

"Kensuke, we're not working right now. You don't need to bow or salute every time I—"  
“真嗣，我们现在不在工作。你不需要每次见到我都鞠躬或敬礼——”

"Just habit, sorry," Kensuke replied, sitting down next to Toji, who now glanced up at Misato, curiously.  
“只是习惯，抱歉，” 真嗣回答道，坐到了冬二旁边，冬二此时好奇地抬头看向美里。

"Oh, hey," he replied in an uncharacteristic tone of bland disinterest.  
"哦，嘿，" 他用一种不寻常的平淡无趣的语气回答道。

"Stressed out, huh?" Misato asked, curiously.  
"压力山大，是吧？" 美里好奇地问道。

"Yeah, I guess you can say that," Toji replied, "Hey, Misato?"  
"嗯，我想你可以这么说，" 冬二回答，"嘿，美里？"

"Yeah?" "嗯？"

"When it happens, you know, does it hurt?"  
"当它发生时，你知道，会痛吗？"

"Oh, uh, well, about that." Misato blushed deep red as she struggled, no doubt, for a delicate, perhaps productive way to tell Toji that the answer to his question was yes, it was excruciating, painful, unbearable, hurt so damn much she'd rather have a battle axe slammed through her torso. "Well, it's not TOO painful. I mean, they put you on medication and anti-pain pills and—"  
"哦，呃，关于那个。" 美里脸红得深红，她挣扎着，毫无疑问，是在寻找一种既委婉又可能有效的方式告诉真治，他的问题的答案是肯定的，那是极其痛苦、难以忍受的，痛得她宁愿被战斧劈穿胸膛。"嗯，不是特别痛。我是说，他们会给你用药和止痛药片之类的——"

The sound of agonized screams filled the air from behind the door.  
门后传来痛苦的尖叫声，空气中弥漫着绝望的气息。

Misato fell silent. 美里沉默了。

"Thanks for at least trying," Toji replied, glumly.  
“至少你尝试过了，”冬二沮丧地回答。

It was at that moment that a doctor departed through those doors, and Toji, the anxious man that he is, jumped up, a tense expression on his face, the expression on his face akin to a sinner seeing God, praying for merciful judgment upon him. He lumbered forward, anxiously, as he spoke, slowly, "Is she—is she—is she alright?"  
"就在那一刻，一位医生从那扇门走了出来，而焦虑不安的冬二立刻跳了起来，脸上带着紧张的表情，那神情宛如一个罪人见到上帝，祈求仁慈的审判降临于他。他蹒跚向前，焦虑地，缓缓地问道：“她——她——她还好吗？””

The doctor, a pleasant looking man probably in his thirties, smiled, and nodded. "Your wife is in pristine condition. The delivery went off splendidly. It's a boy."  
"医生，一个看起来和蔼可亲、大约三十多岁的男子，微笑着点了点头。“您的妻子状况极佳。分娩非常顺利。是个男孩。””

"A boy?" Toji began to giggle to himself, like a giddy school girl, a laugh that grew louder and louder until he fell to his knees, almost in tears as a broad smile spread across his face. Shinji didn't know what to do. He did the thing he supposed was proper for a moment like that: he approached his friend, and patted his back reassuringly. Toji glanced over his shoulder, a smile on his face. "A boy. Can you believe it? a boy."  
"“男孩？”冬二开始自顾自地咯咯笑起来，像个兴奋的小女生，笑声越来越响亮，直到他跪倒在地，几乎要哭出来，脸上绽放出灿烂的笑容。真嗣不知道该做什么。他想在这种时刻应该做的是：他走向朋友，安慰地拍了拍他的背。冬二回头看了一眼，脸上带着笑容。“一个男孩。你能相信吗？一个男孩。””

"I know," Shinji replied, not sure what to say in a time like this. When it had been Makoto, this situation hadn't been nearly as difficult because he had composed himself pretty well, taking everything in stride.  
"我知道，" 真嗣回答道，不确定在这种时候该说些什么。当那是诚的时候，这种情况还没有这么困难，因为他很好地控制了自己，从容应对一切。

"If you want to see your wife, we can let you in, but just be careful: she's exhausted. She's been in labor for quite some time. It's a good thing her friend was with us."  
"如果你想见你的妻子，我们可以让你进去，但请小心：她非常疲惫。她已经分娩了相当长的时间。还好她的朋友和我们在一起。"

"Friend?" Shinji asked, a little confused.  
"朋友？" 真嗣有些困惑地问道。

A second individual existed the double doors to the ward. It was strange: Shinji had asked himself why Asuka was nowhere to be found, but not for a second did he realize, in the event of her friend going through one of the greatest and most painful events in her life, that she'd be in the ward with her friend, helping her own, encouraging her to push, to go on harder, to live. Her long scarlet hair ran down her back, if anything more beautiful than she had been when he first met her. Right now, however, she was just as sweaty as Shinji was, maybe even more so. Her yellow sundress was sticking to her skin, her long crimson hair sticking to her forehead, her baby-blue eyes filled with an exhausted joy, a muted euphoria, a weary happiness.  
另一人从病房的双开门中走了出来。这很奇怪：真嗣曾自问为何找不到明日香，但他从未意识到，在她朋友经历一生中最重大、最痛苦的时刻时，她会在病房里陪伴朋友，帮助她，鼓励她用力、坚持、活下去。她那长长的绯红发丝垂在背后，比初见时更加美丽。然而此刻，她和真嗣一样满身汗水，甚至可能更多。她的黄色太阳裙紧贴着肌肤，长长的深红发丝粘在额头上，那双婴儿蓝的眼睛里充满了疲惫的喜悦，一种沉静的兴奋，一种疲倦的幸福。

"Normally I'd be upset that the Devil was with my wife, but I'll make an exception for today," Toji replied, jumping up and, to Shinji's disbelief, hugging the girl. Shinji thought, at first, that Asuka might be so tired she wouldn't react with that ordinary spitfire tongue of hers, that energy, that bratty streak that hadn't died in the years since her adolescence.  
“通常我会对恶魔和我妻子在一起感到不爽，但今天我破例了，” 阿薰回答道，跳起来，让真嗣难以置信的是，他拥抱了那个女孩。真嗣起初以为，明日香可能太累了，不会像往常那样用她那火爆的舌头回应，那种活力，那种青春期后未曾消逝的顽皮。

She wasn't. 她确实没有。

As Asuka shoved Toji to the floor, she snapped, in a high, strained voice, "Mein Gott! Idiot! Arschloch! Schwein! Ugh!"  
当明日香将真嗣推倒在地时，她用尖锐而紧绷的声音喊道：“我的天啊！白痴！混蛋！猪！呸！”

"What the hell!?" Toji stammered, pushing himself to his feet, stunned, yet frustrated and furious.  
“搞什么鬼！？”真嗣结巴着，挣扎起身，既震惊又沮丧和愤怒。

"Don't hug me! Men are just so stupid!" snapped Asuka, "Hugging people who're just standing there. I did this for Hikari, not you."  
“别抱我！男人就是蠢！”明日香厉声道，“抱那些只是站在那里的人。我这么做是为了光，不是为了你。”

"You just had to ruin a perfectly good moment," Toji stammered, frustrated.  
“你就非得毁了一个完美的好时刻吗？”冬二结结巴巴地说，显得很沮丧。

"Oh, ruin a perfectly good moment? Yeah, right! You think you're stressed out? Imagine how I feel? I had to watch my friend in all that pain! Do you know how much it hurts to give birth? It sucks! You men have no right to just say that you suffered because you had to sit around waiting for us!"  
“哦，毁了一个完美的好时刻？得了吧！你以为你压力大？想象一下我的感受吧？我得看着我的朋友经历那种痛苦！你知道生孩子有多疼吗？太糟糕了！你们男人没资格只因为坐着等我们就说自己受苦了！”

Toji glanced out from the corner of his eyes at Misato, an irate expression on his face. "Nice pain-pills?"  
冬二用眼角瞥了一眼美里，脸上带着恼怒的表情。“止痛药不错？”

"Well, they worked when I was—"  
"嗯，它们在我——"

"Gott in Himmel," sighed Asuka, shaking her head, "If you want to hug someone, hug Hikari. She's in that room, and she sent me out to tell you she wants to see you." Toji glanced down at her, a surprised expression on his face. With a slim smile on her face, she added, "She loves you, you know. A lot. Congratulations." Toji stared at her, still surprised that a demon who had just shoved her to the ground could possibly compliment him immediately after insulting him. Still, the eagerness to see to her wife overrode her curiosity, and he darted past the doctor into the ward.  
"天哪，" 明日香叹了口气，摇着头说，"如果你想抱谁，抱光吧。她在那个房间里，让我出来告诉你她想见你。" 总司低头看着她，脸上露出惊讶的表情。她微微一笑，补充道："她爱你，你知道的。很深。恭喜你。" 总司盯着她，仍然惊讶于一个刚刚把她推倒在地的人居然能在侮辱他之后立刻称赞他。尽管如此，急于见到妻子的渴望压倒了她对这一切的好奇，他匆匆从医生身边跑进了病房。

Asuka sighed, her strong aura of bitchiness deflating as she collapsed on the bench where Toji himself had been sitting. Shinji approached her, surprised to see that Asuka's chest, visible in the sweaty dress, was pulsating dangerously, her heart thumping so hard against her ribs it was visible from a distance. Shinji knew this stress wasn't from Toji hugging her.  
明日香叹了口气，她那股强烈的泼辣气息随着她瘫坐在总司刚才坐过的长椅上而消散。真嗣走近她，惊讶地发现明日香那件汗湿的连衣裙下，胸部剧烈地起伏着，心脏猛烈地撞击着肋骨，从远处都能看得一清二楚。真嗣知道这种紧张不是因为总司拥抱了她。

"Uh, Asuka?" Shinji asked, still too nervous to actually take a seat next to her. What if she lashed out at him?  
“呃，明日香？”真嗣问道，仍然紧张得不敢真正坐到她旁边。万一她对他发火怎么办？

"Hey," Asuka replied, her tone wispy, exhausted, but a small smile spreading up her lips. And exhausted smile, "Sit down, please. You're making me tired just looking at you."  
“嘿，”明日香回答，语气微弱、疲惫，但嘴角还是泛起了一丝微笑。一个疲惫的微笑，“请坐下吧。光是看着你我就累了。”

Feeling braver, he took a seat by the redhead. "How is she?"  
他感觉胆子大了些，便在红发女孩旁边坐下。“她怎么样了？”

"Hikari? She's fine. She's strong, you know? She'll make a great mother, I think. She was considering names for the boy. She thought maybe Shinji would be nice, after you."  
"光？她没事的。她很坚强，你知道的吧？我觉得她会成为一位伟大的母亲。她正在考虑给男孩起名字。她想或许‘真嗣’会不错，以你为名。"

"What? Really?" "什么？真的吗？"

"Yeah, either that or Kensuke. I told her she shouldn't give her child such a terrible name."  
"是啊，要么就是‘健介’。我告诉她不该给孩子起这么糟糕的名字。"

"Hey!" Kensuke stammered, only to realize whom he was speaking to, and recoiled, afraid to be beaten by the devil's tongue.  
"嘿！" 真嗣结巴道，随即意识到自己在和谁说话，便退缩了，生怕被那恶毒的舌头所伤。

"Are you feeling okay, though?" Shinji asked, tentatively placing a hand on her shoulder, concerned for his safety by making physical contact with the German girl.  
"不过，你感觉还好吗？" 真嗣小心翼翼地将手放在她的肩上，担心与这位德国女孩发生身体接触会带来危险。

"Yeah, I'm fine, just tired," Asuka replied, "When we get home, I need to go straight to bed, you know?"  
"嗯，我没事，只是累了，" 明日香回答，"等我们回家后，我得直接上床睡觉，你知道的吧？"

"Oh, okay," Shinji replied, frowning slightly.  
“哦，好吧，”真嗣回答道，微微皱起了眉头。

Asuka scratched the skin behind her ear, brushing aside her hair from her eyes, and, finally, placed a hand on her chest.  
明日香挠了挠耳后的皮肤，将头发从眼前拨开，最后把手放在胸前。

The engagement ring around her finger was clear to see.  
她手指上的订婚戒指清晰可见。

So was that ring's partner on Shinji's finger.  
那枚戒指在真嗣手指上的伴侣亦是如此。
