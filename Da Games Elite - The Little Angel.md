What you are about to read is in no way connected to my previous Fan-Fiction, "In the Case of Asuka Langley Sohryu," which I still recommend you read because, in my opinion, I think it touches upon a certain aspect of the series that people usually don't touch upon: why don't these damn kids just get psychologists to help them with their problems? Well, that not withstanding, I've wanted to find fan-fics where Asuka and Shinji finally confront the horrors of parenthood, and considering just what their parents were like, one having a rather cold and distant father and the other's mother committing suicide in front of her eyes, it left much potential not only to do a great Asuka fan-fic, but also a great Shinji fan-fic as well. Naturally, considering the subject matter, there will be several OCs, but they'll mostly be children.  
你即将阅读的内容与我之前的同人小说《浅谈惣流·明日香·兰格雷的个案》并无任何关联，我仍推荐你阅读，因为在我看来，它触及了该系列中人们通常不涉及的一个方面：这些孩子为何不寻求心理学家帮助解决他们的问题？尽管如此，我一直想找到关于明日香和真嗣最终直面育儿恐怖的同人作品，考虑到他们的父母分别是怎样的人——一个有着冷漠疏离的父亲，另一个的母亲则在眼前自杀，这不仅为创作一部优秀的明日香同人提供了广阔空间，也为真嗣同人开辟了同样广阔的可能性。当然，鉴于主题，会有一些原创角色，但大部分会是孩子。

WARNING: Despite being rated T, there is a very mild, PG-13 level sex scene in the next chapter. This is not a lemon, not a hentai, and the sex will barely count as ecchi. It's more essentially to show the beauty of the human body, and just how two certain characters get into this situation in the first place. If you feel uncomfortable about it, gloss over it. If you're into that sort of stuff, like lemons, I'm sorry, but I want this to reach the general audience.  
警告：尽管评级为 T，下一章中包含一个非常温和的 PG-13 级别性爱场景。这不是柠檬文，不是 hentai，性爱内容几乎算不上是 ecchi。其主要目的是展现人体之美，以及两位特定角色是如何陷入这种情境的。如果你对此感到不适，可以选择略过。如果你喜欢柠檬文这类内容，很抱歉，但我希望这部作品能面向更广泛的读者。

So, without further adieu…  
那么，不再多说……

### **THE LITTLE ANGEL 小天使**

**BY DA GAMES ELITE 由游戏精英创作**

**Part 1 第一部分**

"I mustn't run away, I mustn't run away, I mustn't—"  
“我绝不能逃跑，我绝不能逃跑，我绝不能——”

"Shut up, please." 请闭嘴。

"Sorry." "对不起。"

Usually those were lines spoken by her, telling him to shut up, that he was being annoying, that this stupid habit of his, that fallback on muttering that same mantra to calm his nerves was just immature, irritating, and, once again, stupid. However, for better or worse, the adult known as Shinji Ikari glanced over at the tense individual sitting next to him, a man he had known for over ten years, through the tough times and the bad, a man who was now in both an enviable situation and a pitiful one: Toji Suzuhara.  
通常这些话都是她对他说的，让他闭嘴，说他烦人，他这个愚蠢的习惯，总是用那句咒语来平复自己的紧张情绪，既幼稚又恼人，而且，又一次，愚蠢。然而，不管是好是坏，成年人真嗣一瞥向坐在他旁边紧张兮兮的那个人，一个他认识超过十年的人，经历了艰难和糟糕的时光，一个现在处于令人羡慕和可怜境地的人：铃原东治。

Years ago, Shinji had watched Toji being ripped apart before his eyes. Well, his Eva being ripped apart, anyway, by Shinji's own Unit-01. That had been almost another life time ago. If you saw Toji know, while you wouldn't think he was in the best of health considering the circumstances, he certainly didn't look like a dismembered devastated wreck. His arms had been replaced with metallic, robotic ones. In the early years following Third Impact, they had looked cartoonish, like something out of a sci-fi film. Just plain metal, unhidden, with long wires and bolts clear to the naked eye. Now, however, thanks to the leaps and bounds of technology, and just the leaps and bounds the world had gone through since Third Impact overall, Toji's mechanical arms, while they occasionally made a buzzing sound every so often due to maybe a loose bolt or a tangled up wire, looked like ordinary appendages, skin, muscle fiber, everything.  
多年前，真嗣曾亲眼目睹了 Toji 被撕裂的场景。确切地说，是他的 Eva 被真嗣自己的初号机撕裂。那仿佛是另一个时代的事了。如今若见到 Toji，尽管考虑到他的经历，你不会认为他身体状况良好，但他绝不像一个肢体残缺、精神崩溃的人。他的双臂已被金属机械臂所替代。在第三次冲击后的最初几年，这些机械臂看起来颇为滑稽，像是科幻电影中的道具，裸露的金属材质，长长的电线和螺栓清晰可见。然而，随着科技的飞速进步，以及第三次冲击后世界整体的巨大变迁，Toji 的机械臂如今已与常人无异，偶尔因松动的螺栓或缠绕的电线发出轻微的嗡鸣声，但其外观已完全模拟了皮肤、肌肉纤维等人体组织。

However, like Shinji said, none of this kept Toji from looking like a broken down wreck right now. Sweat was billowing down his forehead; his hair was in the air because of him ruffling it, tugging at it, anxiously twisting in spite of himself. His eyes were bloodshot, probably because he hadn't had a good night's sleep in the last few days, once again due to circumstance. This lack of sleep also contributed to the black bags he wore under his eyes, the bags that sacked down, and made him look as though he were twenty years older than what he really was: a man at the age of 26.  
然而，正如真嗣所说，这一切都没能让东治看起来不像个支离破碎的废人。汗水正从他的额头滚滚而下；他的头发因为不断抓挠、拉扯，焦虑地扭动而竖立着。他的眼睛布满血丝，很可能是因为他已经好几天没能好好睡上一觉了，这又是环境所迫。这种睡眠不足也导致了他的眼下挂着黑眼圈，那些眼袋下垂，让他看起来仿佛比实际年龄大了二十岁：一个 26 岁的男人。

He looked, for all intents and purposes, like a damn zombie!  
从各方面来看，他简直就像个该死的僵尸！

And Shinji could do nothing about it.  
而真嗣对此无能为力。

"Hey," Shinji mumbled, anxiously wriggling his fingers as he glanced over at Toji, "Do you want me to get you a drink or something? You look like you could use—"  
"嘿，" 真嗣咕哝着，焦虑地扭动着手指，同时瞥向东治，"你要不要我给你拿点喝的？你看起来好像需要——"

"I'm fine, thanks," Toji replied, staring up at the door he had been staring at, waiting in front of, for the last several hours.  
"我没事，谢谢，" 东治回答道，抬头盯着他已经盯着、等待了几个小时的门。

"Are you sure? Listen, she'll be fine, just—"  
"你确定吗？听着，她会没事的，只是——"

"Get yourself a drink. You could use it," Toji replied, glancing over at his friend for a moment.  
“去给自己弄点喝的吧，你正需要这个。” 冬二回答道，目光短暂地瞥向他的朋友。

This was true. In spite of himself, Shinji too looked exhausted. Extremely so.  
这话不假。尽管自己不愿承认，真嗣也显得疲惫不堪。极其疲惫。

Shinji walked down the hospital ward, away from the bench where Toji and their other long time friend Kensuke sat. As he rose, Shinji noticed that Kensuke was actually sound asleep, leaning against the white, cold wall of the hospital hallway. No doubt his job as a military tactician had long hours and lots of stress, so Shinji thought, out of the three of them, HE'D be the one awake, the most calm. But no, he was currently comatose, asleep against the wall, drooling a little bit. His thick brown hair was pressed between his skull and the wall, his usually pasty skin wasn't any more or less pasty than it usually was, his small, slim frame didn't look nearly as exhausted as Toji's large, muscular frame did.  
真嗣沿着医院病房走去，远离了冬二和他们的另一位老朋友健介所坐的长椅。当他起身时，真嗣注意到健介实际上正熟睡着，靠在医院走廊那冰冷的白墙上。毫无疑问，作为军事战术家的工作时长和压力都很大，所以真嗣原以为，在他们三人中，健介会是那个保持清醒、最为镇定的人。但事实并非如此，他此刻正昏昏沉沉地靠在墙上，嘴角还流着口水。他浓密的棕发被压在头骨和墙壁之间，他那通常苍白的皮肤并没有比平时更苍白或更不苍白，他那瘦小的身躯看起来远没有冬二那魁梧的身躯那般疲惫。

"I'll be right back. I just need to use the bathroom a little bit," Shinji replied.  
"我马上回来。只是需要稍微去一下洗手间，" 真嗣回答道。

"Take your time. I'm sure nothing will happen for at least another half-hour," Toji replied, in that tense, strained voice of his.  
"慢慢来。我敢肯定至少还有半小时不会发生什么事，" 东治回答道，声音紧张而勉强。

It bothered Shinji just to see his friend this upset. He'd known him for years, he reflected as he walked down the hallway to whatever destination he intended at arriving at. He'd known him before and after the nightmare known as Third Impact, just like he'd known Kensuke, Hikari, and—  
看到朋友如此心烦意乱，真嗣感到不安。他回想起他们多年的友情，以及在被称为第三次冲击的噩梦前后的点点滴滴，就像他认识剑介、光和——

Where was she, anyway? Where was that German girl? Didn't she realize what her friend was going through right now? What was Shinji saying? Of course she did. She had been the one who had called him last night to tell him to move his ass and arrive at the hospital ASAP. Of course, she had been far harsher with that spitfire tongue of hers, but, in all honesty, Shinji could tell she was worried, concerned, maybe even a little afraid for her friend. This was supposed to be one of the best moments of Toji's life, of Hikari's life, and yet it was proving to be one of the longest, most drawn out periods of stress Shinji had experienced in the last five or six years.  
她到底在哪里？那个德国女孩呢？她难道不知道她朋友现在正经历着什么吗？真嗣在说什么？当然，她肯定知道。昨晚就是她打电话给他，让他赶紧动身，尽快赶到医院。当然，她那火爆的舌头说得更严厉，但说实话，真嗣能感觉到她的担忧，关心，或许还有点为她朋友担心。这本应是剑介一生中最美好的时刻，也是光一生中最美好的时刻，然而现在却成了真嗣过去五六年里经历的最漫长、最紧张的时刻之一。

Nothing next to the pain he felt during that nightmarish day, though.  
尽管如此，没有什么能比得上那个噩梦般的日子里他所感受到的痛苦。

Nothing like the Hell that was Third Impact.  
没有什么能比得上第三次冲击的地狱。

He had to stop reflecting on that day! Third Impact had occurred over a decade ago! It was over, finished! It was a nightmare he was never going to need to relive again, those first three years of utter chaos, the first seven months where he and Asuka remained alone, struggling to survive, wondering if anyone would ever return, the next year seeing civilization struggle to return to normalcy, and, for the rest of the immediate aftermath of Third Impact, watch the nation crumble apart before the remnants of NERV decided to put things in order. The horrors of finding people's starving bodies on the ground in heaps, of seeing people slaughtered in genocide, of being held a prisoner in questioning booths and concentration camps, it was all in the past! All in the damn past!  
他不得不停止回想那一天！第三次冲击已经过去十多年了！一切都结束了，完结了！那是一场他再也不需要重温的噩梦，最初的三年完全混乱，前七个月他和明日香孤立无援，挣扎求生，不知道是否还会有人回来，接下来的一年里，文明努力恢复正常，而在第三次冲击的余波中，眼看着国家分崩离析，直到 NERV 的残余力量决定恢复秩序。那些在街头发现成堆饿死的人们，目睹种族灭绝中的屠杀，被囚禁在审讯亭和集中营里的恐怖经历，都已成为过去！全都他妈的过去了！

Finding himself in front of a sink in the blue-tiled bathroom of this hospital, Shinji threw water against his face, rubbing it clean as he realized the absurdity of what he was saying. All in the past? That was just stupid, as Asuka would always say! He knew that those events had affected him on a deeper level, yes, and that he could never change them. The world he lived in now was drastically affected by those days. All he could do now was hope for a better tomorrow, and, with all that had been going on in the last few years, things had been better.  
发现自己站在医院蓝色瓷砖的洗手间前，真嗣将水泼向脸庞，揉搓着洗净，同时意识到自己所说的话有多荒谬。一切都过去了？那真是愚蠢，就像明日香常说的那样！他知道那些事件在他内心深处留下了影响，是的，他永远无法改变它们。他现在生活的世界深受那些日子的影响。他现在能做的就是期待一个更好的明天，而且，在过去的几年里，事情确实有所好转。

As Shinji left the bathroom, he heard a voice crack as it shouted his name. He glanced over his shoulder, only to see a pair of arms wrap themselves around his face, smothering him in a pair of thick breasts, strangling him, choking the life out of him. He turned blue in a matter of moments, barely able to pull away from that restrictive bear hug only to find, to his utter astonishment, fused of course with utter delight, Misato Katsuragi—er—Misato Hyuga, a woman who had been more a mother to him than even the woman named Yui Ikari, who now was somewhere in the depths of space, perhaps gone forever from Shinji's life.  
当真嗣离开洗手间时，他听到一个声音嘶哑地喊着他的名字。他回头一看，只见一双胳膊紧紧地抱住他的脸，用一对丰满的胸部将他闷住，勒得他喘不过气来。他很快就脸色发青，几乎无法挣脱那个束缚的熊抱，结果却发现，当然也带着无比的惊喜，是美里·卡苏拉吉——呃——美里·日向，这个女人对他来说比名为唯·碇的女人更像母亲，而唯·碇现在可能在太空深处，也许永远离开了真嗣的生活。

Shinji didn't like thinking about that. After all, here was Misato! Don't think about the past, the present! Here! Now! Misato!  
真嗣不喜欢去想那些事。毕竟，眼前是美里啊！别去想过去，别去想现在！就在这里！就在此刻！美里！

Somehow, this didn't cheer him up much at all.  
不知为何，这丝毫没有让他感到振奋。

"Oh, Shinji! I've missed you so—hey, what's wrong?" Misato asked, finally drawing back from her heart-felt, and in Shinji's case boob felt, greeting, only to notice that the recipient of the hug, or perhaps victim would be the better term, wasn't nearly as happy as she was. "Are you stressed about Hikari? Don't be. She'll be fine. It'll all turn out for the best in the end, so don't worry about a thing."  
“哦，真嗣！我好想你——嘿，怎么了？”美里终于从她那发自内心的，对真嗣来说则是胸部感受的问候中退开，这才注意到拥抱的接受者，或许用受害者更恰当，并没有像她那样开心。“你是在担心光吗？别担心。她会没事的。一切最终都会好起来的，所以别担心。”

Shinji, in his flashback, had almost forgotten about the reason he was in this damn, ice cold hospital in the first place. Shaking the cobwebs out of his head, he replied, in a strained voice, "Oh, I'm fine, don't worry."  
在回忆中，真嗣几乎忘记了最初自己为何会在这该死的、冰冷的医院里。他摇摇头驱散思绪，用略显沙哑的声音回答：“哦，我没事，别担心。”

Misato glanced at him critically, and, for the first time in awhile, Shinji had a good look at the woman who had helped raise him before and after—don't think of it, don't think of it, don't think of it! Well, avoiding that thing that would cause him to regress once again into a painful reflection, Misato had aged slightly. Her face had developed slight laugh lines in the ten years past—Damn it! Don't think that way!—that day. Her hair had even developed one or two gray hairs that she seemed to have forgotten, conveniently enough, to dye. Additionally, it looked like her drinking had caught up to her in some degree, as her body now looked slightly puffier than it had last, as though a thin deposit of fat had grown all over her body. Still, to the ordinary person who hadn't known Misato in her heyday, she was quite a knock-out, especially for an older woman.  
美里用审视的目光看了他一眼，而真嗣也难得有机会仔细打量这位在他成长过程中一直照顾他的女性——别想了，别想了，别想了！好吧，避开那个会让他再次陷入痛苦回忆的念头，美里确实有些变化。她的脸上多了几道笑纹，那是过去十年间留下的痕迹——该死！别这么想！那天之后。她的头发里也冒出了一两根白发，她似乎忘了染发。此外，她的饮酒习惯似乎也开始显现影响，身体看起来比上次见面时略显臃肿，仿佛全身都长了一层薄薄的脂肪。不过，对于那些不熟悉美里年轻时风采的普通人来说，她依然是个美人，尤其是对于一位年长的女性而言。

Shinji never thought he'd call Misato an older woman, ever.  
真嗣从未想过自己会称美里为年长的女性。

"You know, Shinji, when you say 'I'm fine' that just screams out how damn upset you really are, but I'll let that one slide," Misato replied, a small grin on her lips, "Look, I know how you must feel. I mean, Makoto went through the same thing with me when I had Yumi." Misato rested a hand absentmindedly on her torso, as though she could still feel the fetus kicking inside of her. "And he went through the same thing with Ryouji." She added, on a gentler note.  
"你知道吗，真嗣，当你说‘我没事’的时候，那简直就是在尖叫你有多么难过，不过这次我就放过你吧，"美里回答道，嘴角带着一丝微笑，"听着，我知道你现在的感受。我是说，诚在优米出生时也经历了同样的事情。"美里不经意地把手放在腹部，仿佛还能感觉到胎儿在里面踢动。"他和谅司也经历了同样的事情。"她补充道，语气更加温柔。

"Uh, where are your children, anyway? Are they with Makoto?"  
"呃，你的孩子们呢？他们和诚在一起吗？"

"Yeah, I mean, he wanted to come, believe me, but someone needed to watch the kids, and he knew I would probably be better emotional support for you guys, so he sent me." Misato added a little laugh at the end, as though to assure Shinji she was fine and happy that she was arriving to this event alone, but Shinji knew differently.  
"是的，我是说，他本来也想来，相信我，但总得有人照顾孩子，而且他知道我可能会是你们更好的情感支持，所以他让我来了。"美里在结尾处加了一点笑声，似乎是为了向真嗣保证她很好，很高兴独自来参加这个活动，但真嗣知道事实并非如此。

Still, he didn't bring it up.  
然而，他并未提及此事。

"So, uh, do you want to come back with us? We're just sitting there, waiting."  
"那么，呃，你想跟我们回去吗？我们只是坐在那里，等着。"

"Okay, that's fine," Misato replied, nodding as the two of them went off to the hospital ward where Toji and Kensuke were. As they walked together, Misato glanced around the hospital, in mild awe, as though the cold interior of this place were something out of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. After a few minutes of glancing around at the occasional hanging picture of a flower or of a random historical figure who had done something special in the field of medicine, she asked, "Is this the hospital that Maya's in charge of?"  
"好的，没关系，" 美里回答道，点头示意两人前往医院病房，那里有真治和健介。他们并肩而行，美里环顾医院四周，带着些许敬畏，仿佛这冰冷的内部环境是出自威利旺卡巧克力工厂的奇景。几分钟后，她不时瞥向偶尔悬挂的花卉画或某位在医学领域有特殊贡献的历史人物肖像，问道："这是玛雅负责的医院吗？"

"Huh? Oh, yeah, she does."  
"嗯？哦，对，她是这样。"

"Oh, that's nice." "哦，那挺好的。"

"Yeah, it is." "是啊，确实不错。"

An awkward silence filled the time period following this statement. For a moment, the two individuals simply walked down the hallway, until Shinji asked, curiously, "Does Makoto have any news on whether—"  
这句话之后，一阵尴尬的沉默弥漫开来。有那么一会儿，两人只是默默地走在走廊上，直到真嗣好奇地问道：“真琴有没有关于是否——的消息？”

"We don't know where Ritsuko is yet," Misato replied, frowning slightly. She glanced over at her side, at the ground by her feet. "And we haven't found—haven't found—"  
“我们还不知道律子在哪里，”美里回答，微微皱眉。她瞥了一眼身旁，目光落在脚边的地面上。“而且我们还没找到——还没找到——”

"Uh, Misato, we're here," Shinji said, gesturing toward Toji as he remained huddled on a bench, with Kensuke slowly rousing himself from slumber land. Rubbing the sleep from his eyes, Kensuke Aida glanced up, noticing Misato for the first time.  
“呃，美里，我们到了，”真嗣说着，指向仍然蜷缩在长椅上的冬二，以及正慢慢从睡梦中醒来的健介。揉着惺忪的睡眼，相田健介抬起头，第一次注意到美里。

"Misato! Good morning!" Kensuke stammered, rising to his feet and bowing slightly.  
“美里！早上好！” 真嗣结结巴巴地说着，站起身来微微鞠了一躬。

"Kensuke, we're not working right now. You don't need to bow or salute every time I—"  
“真嗣，我们现在不在工作。你不需要每次见到我都鞠躬或敬礼——”

"Just habit, sorry," Kensuke replied, sitting down next to Toji, who now glanced up at Misato, curiously.  
“只是习惯，抱歉，” 真嗣回答道，坐到了冬二旁边，冬二此时好奇地抬头看向美里。

"Oh, hey," he replied in an uncharacteristic tone of bland disinterest.  
"哦，嘿，" 他用一种不寻常的平淡无趣的语气回答道。

"Stressed out, huh?" Misato asked, curiously.  
"压力山大，是吧？" 美里好奇地问道。

"Yeah, I guess you can say that," Toji replied, "Hey, Misato?"  
"嗯，我想你可以这么说，" 冬二回答，"嘿，美里？"

"Yeah?" "嗯？"

"When it happens, you know, does it hurt?"  
"当它发生时，你知道，会痛吗？"

"Oh, uh, well, about that." Misato blushed deep red as she struggled, no doubt, for a delicate, perhaps productive way to tell Toji that the answer to his question was yes, it was excruciating, painful, unbearable, hurt so damn much she'd rather have a battle axe slammed through her torso. "Well, it's not TOO painful. I mean, they put you on medication and anti-pain pills and—"  
"哦，呃，关于那个。" 美里脸红得深红，她挣扎着，毫无疑问，是在寻找一种既委婉又可能有效的方式告诉真治，他的问题的答案是肯定的，那是极其痛苦、难以忍受的，痛得她宁愿被战斧劈穿胸膛。"嗯，不是特别痛。我是说，他们会给你用药和止痛药片之类的——"

The sound of agonized screams filled the air from behind the door.  
门后传来痛苦的尖叫声，空气中弥漫着绝望的气息。

Misato fell silent. 美里沉默了。

"Thanks for at least trying," Toji replied, glumly.  
“至少你尝试过了，”冬二沮丧地回答。

It was at that moment that a doctor departed through those doors, and Toji, the anxious man that he is, jumped up, a tense expression on his face, the expression on his face akin to a sinner seeing God, praying for merciful judgment upon him. He lumbered forward, anxiously, as he spoke, slowly, "Is she—is she—is she alright?"  
"就在那一刻，一位医生从那扇门走了出来，而焦虑不安的冬二立刻跳了起来，脸上带着紧张的表情，那神情宛如一个罪人见到上帝，祈求仁慈的审判降临于他。他蹒跚向前，焦虑地，缓缓地问道：“她——她——她还好吗？””

The doctor, a pleasant looking man probably in his thirties, smiled, and nodded. "Your wife is in pristine condition. The delivery went off splendidly. It's a boy."  
"医生，一个看起来和蔼可亲、大约三十多岁的男子，微笑着点了点头。“您的妻子状况极佳。分娩非常顺利。是个男孩。””

"A boy?" Toji began to giggle to himself, like a giddy school girl, a laugh that grew louder and louder until he fell to his knees, almost in tears as a broad smile spread across his face. Shinji didn't know what to do. He did the thing he supposed was proper for a moment like that: he approached his friend, and patted his back reassuringly. Toji glanced over his shoulder, a smile on his face. "A boy. Can you believe it? a boy."  
"“男孩？”冬二开始自顾自地咯咯笑起来，像个兴奋的小女生，笑声越来越响亮，直到他跪倒在地，几乎要哭出来，脸上绽放出灿烂的笑容。真嗣不知道该做什么。他想在这种时刻应该做的是：他走向朋友，安慰地拍了拍他的背。冬二回头看了一眼，脸上带着笑容。“一个男孩。你能相信吗？一个男孩。””

"I know," Shinji replied, not sure what to say in a time like this. When it had been Makoto, this situation hadn't been nearly as difficult because he had composed himself pretty well, taking everything in stride.  
"我知道，" 真嗣回答道，不确定在这种时候该说些什么。当那是诚的时候，这种情况还没有这么困难，因为他很好地控制了自己，从容应对一切。

"If you want to see your wife, we can let you in, but just be careful: she's exhausted. She's been in labor for quite some time. It's a good thing her friend was with us."  
"如果你想见你的妻子，我们可以让你进去，但请小心：她非常疲惫。她已经分娩了相当长的时间。还好她的朋友和我们在一起。"

"Friend?" Shinji asked, a little confused.  
"朋友？" 真嗣有些困惑地问道。

A second individual existed the double doors to the ward. It was strange: Shinji had asked himself why Asuka was nowhere to be found, but not for a second did he realize, in the event of her friend going through one of the greatest and most painful events in her life, that she'd be in the ward with her friend, helping her own, encouraging her to push, to go on harder, to live. Her long scarlet hair ran down her back, if anything more beautiful than she had been when he first met her. Right now, however, she was just as sweaty as Shinji was, maybe even more so. Her yellow sundress was sticking to her skin, her long crimson hair sticking to her forehead, her baby-blue eyes filled with an exhausted joy, a muted euphoria, a weary happiness.  
另一人从病房的双开门中走了出来。这很奇怪：真嗣曾自问为何找不到明日香，但他从未意识到，在她朋友经历一生中最重大、最痛苦的时刻时，她会在病房里陪伴朋友，帮助她，鼓励她用力、坚持、活下去。她那长长的绯红发丝垂在背后，比初见时更加美丽。然而此刻，她和真嗣一样满身汗水，甚至可能更多。她的黄色太阳裙紧贴着肌肤，长长的深红发丝粘在额头上，那双婴儿蓝的眼睛里充满了疲惫的喜悦，一种沉静的兴奋，一种疲倦的幸福。

"Normally I'd be upset that the Devil was with my wife, but I'll make an exception for today," Toji replied, jumping up and, to Shinji's disbelief, hugging the girl. Shinji thought, at first, that Asuka might be so tired she wouldn't react with that ordinary spitfire tongue of hers, that energy, that bratty streak that hadn't died in the years since her adolescence.  
“通常我会对恶魔和我妻子在一起感到不爽，但今天我破例了，” 阿薰回答道，跳起来，让真嗣难以置信的是，他拥抱了那个女孩。真嗣起初以为，明日香可能太累了，不会像往常那样用她那火爆的舌头回应，那种活力，那种青春期后未曾消逝的顽皮。

She wasn't. 她确实没有。

As Asuka shoved Toji to the floor, she snapped, in a high, strained voice, "Mein Gott! Idiot! Arschloch! Schwein! Ugh!"  
当明日香将真嗣推倒在地时，她用尖锐而紧绷的声音喊道：“我的天啊！白痴！混蛋！猪！呸！”

"What the hell!?" Toji stammered, pushing himself to his feet, stunned, yet frustrated and furious.  
“搞什么鬼！？”真嗣结巴着，挣扎起身，既震惊又沮丧和愤怒。

"Don't hug me! Men are just so stupid!" snapped Asuka, "Hugging people who're just standing there. I did this for Hikari, not you."  
“别抱我！男人就是蠢！”明日香厉声道，“抱那些只是站在那里的人。我这么做是为了光，不是为了你。”

"You just had to ruin a perfectly good moment," Toji stammered, frustrated.  
“你就非得毁了一个完美的好时刻吗？”冬二结结巴巴地说，显得很沮丧。

"Oh, ruin a perfectly good moment? Yeah, right! You think you're stressed out? Imagine how I feel? I had to watch my friend in all that pain! Do you know how much it hurts to give birth? It sucks! You men have no right to just say that you suffered because you had to sit around waiting for us!"  
“哦，毁了一个完美的好时刻？得了吧！你以为你压力大？想象一下我的感受吧？我得看着我的朋友经历那种痛苦！你知道生孩子有多疼吗？太糟糕了！你们男人没资格只因为坐着等我们就说自己受苦了！”

Toji glanced out from the corner of his eyes at Misato, an irate expression on his face. "Nice pain-pills?"  
冬二用眼角瞥了一眼美里，脸上带着恼怒的表情。“止痛药不错？”

"Well, they worked when I was—"  
"嗯，它们在我——"

"Gott in Himmel," sighed Asuka, shaking her head, "If you want to hug someone, hug Hikari. She's in that room, and she sent me out to tell you she wants to see you." Toji glanced down at her, a surprised expression on his face. With a slim smile on her face, she added, "She loves you, you know. A lot. Congratulations." Toji stared at her, still surprised that a demon who had just shoved her to the ground could possibly compliment him immediately after insulting him. Still, the eagerness to see to her wife overrode her curiosity, and he darted past the doctor into the ward.  
"天哪，" 明日香叹了口气，摇着头说，"如果你想抱谁，抱光吧。她在那个房间里，让我出来告诉你她想见你。" 总司低头看着她，脸上露出惊讶的表情。她微微一笑，补充道："她爱你，你知道的。很深。恭喜你。" 总司盯着她，仍然惊讶于一个刚刚把她推倒在地的人居然能在侮辱他之后立刻称赞他。尽管如此，急于见到妻子的渴望压倒了她对这一切的好奇，他匆匆从医生身边跑进了病房。

Asuka sighed, her strong aura of bitchiness deflating as she collapsed on the bench where Toji himself had been sitting. Shinji approached her, surprised to see that Asuka's chest, visible in the sweaty dress, was pulsating dangerously, her heart thumping so hard against her ribs it was visible from a distance. Shinji knew this stress wasn't from Toji hugging her.  
明日香叹了口气，她那股强烈的泼辣气息随着她瘫坐在总司刚才坐过的长椅上而消散。真嗣走近她，惊讶地发现明日香那件汗湿的连衣裙下，胸部剧烈地起伏着，心脏猛烈地撞击着肋骨，从远处都能看得一清二楚。真嗣知道这种紧张不是因为总司拥抱了她。

"Uh, Asuka?" Shinji asked, still too nervous to actually take a seat next to her. What if she lashed out at him?  
“呃，明日香？”真嗣问道，仍然紧张得不敢真正坐到她旁边。万一她对他发火怎么办？

"Hey," Asuka replied, her tone wispy, exhausted, but a small smile spreading up her lips. And exhausted smile, "Sit down, please. You're making me tired just looking at you."  
“嘿，”明日香回答，语气微弱、疲惫，但嘴角还是泛起了一丝微笑。一个疲惫的微笑，“请坐下吧。光是看着你我就累了。”

Feeling braver, he took a seat by the redhead. "How is she?"  
他感觉胆子大了些，便在红发女孩旁边坐下。“她怎么样了？”

"Hikari? She's fine. She's strong, you know? She'll make a great mother, I think. She was considering names for the boy. She thought maybe Shinji would be nice, after you."  
"光？她没事的。她很坚强，你知道的吧？我觉得她会成为一位伟大的母亲。她正在考虑给男孩起名字。她想或许‘真嗣’会不错，以你为名。"

"What? Really?" "什么？真的吗？"

"Yeah, either that or Kensuke. I told her she shouldn't give her child such a terrible name."  
"是啊，要么就是‘健介’。我告诉她不该给孩子起这么糟糕的名字。"

"Hey!" Kensuke stammered, only to realize whom he was speaking to, and recoiled, afraid to be beaten by the devil's tongue.  
"嘿！" 真嗣结巴道，随即意识到自己在和谁说话，便退缩了，生怕被那恶毒的舌头所伤。

"Are you feeling okay, though?" Shinji asked, tentatively placing a hand on her shoulder, concerned for his safety by making physical contact with the German girl.  
"不过，你感觉还好吗？" 真嗣小心翼翼地将手放在她的肩上，担心与这位德国女孩发生身体接触会带来危险。

"Yeah, I'm fine, just tired," Asuka replied, "When we get home, I need to go straight to bed, you know?"  
"嗯，我没事，只是累了，" 明日香回答，"等我们回家后，我得直接上床睡觉，你知道的吧？"

"Oh, okay," Shinji replied, frowning slightly.  
“哦，好吧，”真嗣回答道，微微皱起了眉头。

Asuka scratched the skin behind her ear, brushing aside her hair from her eyes, and, finally, placed a hand on her chest.  
明日香挠了挠耳后的皮肤，将头发从眼前拨开，最后把手放在胸前。

The engagement ring around her finger was clear to see.  
她手指上的订婚戒指清晰可见。

So was that ring's partner on Shinji's finger.  
那枚戒指在真嗣手指上的伴侣亦是如此。

**Part 2 第二部分**

Leaving the bathroom, the young adult known as Shinji Ikari glanced down at the bed partially illuminated by the light filtering behind him. He watched the lovely German in his bed turn over, her scarlet hair twisting underneath her light weight, her flexed fingers pressed against her lips in her slumber, as though she were trying to pull herself into a loose fetal position. She moaned softly in the back of her throat as Shinji approached, sitting down gently beside her to avoid invoking her wrath. To think that, when they were young, Asuka wouldn't have even let him get THAT close.  
离开浴室，被称为碇真嗣的年轻人瞥了一眼那张被身后光线部分照亮的床。他看着床上那位美丽的德国少女翻身，她那鲜红的头发在她轻盈的身躯下缠绕，弯曲的手指紧贴着嘴唇，仿佛在睡梦中试图将自己蜷缩成一个松散的胎儿姿势。随着真嗣的靠近，她喉咙深处发出轻微的呻吟声，真嗣轻轻地坐在她旁边，以免激起她的怒火。回想起来，在他们年幼时，明日香甚至不会让他靠得那么近。

He would've been too terrified to even get NEAR her.  
他本会害怕得连靠近她都不敢。

Terrified? No, not really terrified, but just unwilling to hear her shout and scream like she used to do all the time. Sure, they were just teens in the years before Third Impact, but even so, he wondered if he had loved her even then. When all had gone to Hell as the clock was minutes to midnight, she was the one he went to, who he begged for help, for attention. It was always her, not Misato, not Rei, certainly not his father, her. Of course, then he had done that horrible thing to her, a thing that he felt disgusted by. His psychologists, as following the hell of Third Impact they were all given well-needed psychologists, told him that what he did was just an act after being forced to kill the one person who said he loved him after watching every one of those near and dear to Shinji either lose their minds, die, or emotionally abandon him. He was just desperate, and wasn't in a right state of mind to make proper decisions.  
害怕？不，并非真的害怕，只是不愿再听到她像以前那样大喊大叫。没错，他们在第三次冲击前的那些年都还只是青少年，但即便如此，他不禁怀疑自己当时是否已经爱上了她。当一切陷入地狱，时钟即将敲响午夜的钟声时，他是去找她，向她求助，渴望她的关注。总是她，不是美里，不是丽，更不是他的父亲，是她。当然，后来他做了那件可怕的事，一件让他感到厌恶的事。在第三次冲击的炼狱之后，他们都得到了急需的心理医生，他们告诉他，他所做的一切只是在被迫杀死那个声称爱他的人之后的行为，眼看着身边亲近的人一个个精神崩溃、死去或情感上抛弃他。他只是绝望了，精神状态并不适合做出正确的决定。

That being said, he still hated what he did.  
尽管如此，他仍然憎恨自己所做的一切。

He didn't have the right, no matter how the doctors rationalized, to masturbate over his comatose friends.  
无论医生们如何合理化，他都没有权利对着昏迷的朋友自慰。

He sat down next to the girl, only to tentatively reach out for her, but drew his hand away, despite the band around his finger that he had given to her one-month prior. He glanced at it, in a dazed sort of way, and remembered the preparation it took to actually gather enough courage to go and propose to the German. For someone like Shinji, that was easier said than done. It wasn't like he was completely pathetic, just somewhat pathetic. That's how Shinji saw it, anyway. The fact of the matter was that the German, the Second Child, Asuka, was, for all intents and purposes, a tough girl to understand. Even now, YEARS after they first met, he didn't know much about her. He knew that her mother had died, although he didn't know how, he knew she still didn't care for her stepmother, or to be honest any of her family, all that much, how she still prided herself on her abilities as an Eva Pilot despite not being in the cockpit of the Eva for at least a decade, but most of what he knew of her was from the period of time he had spent with her.  
他坐在女孩旁边，小心翼翼地伸出手去触碰她，却又缩了回来，尽管手指上还戴着一个月前他送给她的戒指。他有些茫然地看了一眼戒指，想起了当初鼓起勇气向那位德国人求婚所做的准备。对于真嗣这样的人来说，说起来容易做起来难。他并不完全可悲，只是有点可悲。至少真嗣自己是这么看的。事实是，那位德国人，二号适格者明日香，从各方面来说都是一个难以理解的女孩。即使现在，在他们初次相遇多年之后，他对她的了解依然不多。他知道她的母亲去世了，虽然不知道原因，他知道她仍然不喜欢她的继母，或者说她对任何家人都不太在意，她仍然以自己作为 EVA 驾驶员的能力为傲，尽管至少十年没有驾驶过 EVA 了，但他对她的了解大多来自与她共度的那段时间。

As he laid down beside her, his mind wandered away, off into a distant time, years ago, until he had returned to that blood-red sea and dead looking beach, with the massive pieces of Rei Ayanami's naked body, pieces that dwarfed skyscrapers, drifting eerily in the water, buoyant somehow despite their mass. The girl known as Asuka Langley Sohryu was currently sleeping on the sand. It had probably been a few weeks since she had returned, for, despite still being in that red plug suit of hers, stained with even darker crimson blood, Shinji had removed the bandages around her arm and the eye patch on her eye. Although surgery had rid the German of any trace of these injuries, back then, they were infected and flaming. Her arm, the arm that had been bisected in her final battle, had somehow healed up down the middle, but not without leaving a great big scar. Her eye, gouged out in that same battle, had partially healed when she returned from the sea of LCL. Although the eyeball itself occupied her eye socket, it was completely blind, and, occasionally, she cried crimson tears. However, what agonized the scarlet haired girl the most was her organs.  
当他躺倒在她的身旁，思绪飘散，穿越时空，回到多年前，回到那片血红的海与死寂的沙滩，巨大的绫波零裸体残骸，其体积超越摩天大楼，诡异地漂浮在水中，尽管质量巨大却不知为何能浮起。被称为惣流·明日香·兰格雷的女孩此刻正躺在沙滩上沉睡。她归来可能已有数周，因为尽管仍穿着那件沾满更深暗红血迹的红色插入栓服，真嗣已将她手臂上的绷带和眼上的眼罩取下。虽然手术已让这位德国少女身上再无这些伤痕的痕迹，但那时，它们感染严重，如火焚身。她那在最终战斗中被斩断的手臂，不知怎的从中线愈合，却留下一道巨大的疤痕。那只在那场战斗中被挖出的眼睛，从 LCL 之海归来时已部分愈合。虽然眼球占据了眼窝，却完全失明，偶尔还会流出鲜红的泪水。然而，最令这位红发少女痛苦的是她的内脏。

In the battle with the Mass Production Evas, Asuka's Evangelion had been disemboweled. Due to the great level of synchronization with her Eva, her organs too had been skewered inside of her body. At least that's how Asuka had explained it after she had recovered from the shock of dying and returning to life in this Hell. Shinji wasn't sure just how much damage Asuka had retained in her returning to life, and he was not knowledgeable when it came to the human anatomy.  
在与量产型 EVA 的战斗中，明日香的 EVA 被开膛破肚。由于与她的 EVA 高度同步，她的内脏也被刺穿在体内。至少明日香在从死亡和重生于这个地狱的震惊中恢复后是这样解释的。真嗣不确定明日香重生后还保留了多少伤害，他对人体解剖学也不甚了解。

All he knew was that, when she cried out in pain and began gagging on her own blood, he was afraid.  
他所知道的是，当她痛苦地呼喊并开始咳血时，他感到害怕。

Shinji had weaved a makeshift blanket together using reeds he had found on the side of the beach. It was sloppy, ill-made, but it was enough to keep one warm in the cold nights on that beach, waiting for someone else to return. Crabs and other sea animals had returned, so surely living humans were next. He had glanced over at Asuka, who was tossing and turning on the sandy beach. He had approached her, and, tentatively, laid the blanket over her, the stiff reeds splintering as he attempted to tuck the blanket around her, hoping it would keep her warm.  
真嗣用他在海滩边找到的芦苇编织了一条临时毯子。虽然做得粗糙，但足以在海滩上寒冷的夜晚保暖，等待其他人归来。螃蟹和其他海洋生物已经回来了，所以活人应该也快了。他瞥了一眼在沙滩上辗转反侧的明日香。他走近她，试探性地把毯子盖在她身上，试图用僵硬的芦苇将毯子围在她周围，希望这能让她保持温暖。

He needed her. 他需要她。

He needed someone. 他需要某个人。

Before he could finish covering her cold svelte body with the reeds, however, her eyes snapped open. She pushed herself up, ripping the reed blanket to pieces. Shinji had watched as all that hard work, all that time and effort putting together some sort of protection from the cold environment, turn out to be all for naught. Shinji didn't even see Asuka vomit a profuse amount of blood as she gasped for air, crying to herself as she squeezed her side. He only noticed her plight when she fell to the ground, twitching slightly on the floor.  
然而，在他用芦苇覆盖她冰冷纤细的身体之前，她的眼睛突然睁开了。她猛地坐起身，将芦苇毯撕成碎片。真嗣眼睁睁看着自己辛苦编织的、为了抵御寒冷环境的保护措施化为乌有。他甚至没注意到明日香在喘息中吐出大量鲜血，一边哭泣一边紧按着侧腹。直到她倒在地上，微微抽搐时，他才注意到她的困境。

"Asuka!" he had shouted, darting to her side, reaching out for her.  
"明日香！" 他大喊着，疾步冲到她身边，伸出手想要触碰她。

He slapped his hand away.  
他猛地拍开了他的手。

"Don't touch me," Asuka whispered in her weak voice, between gasps of air, "Don't get near me. Don't look at me. I don't want to see your disgusting face ever again."  
"别碰我，" 明日香用微弱的声音低语，每说一句都伴随着急促的呼吸，"别靠近我。别看我。我再也不想看到你那张令人作呕的脸。

Shinji could only stare in shock. All he wanted to do was help her. That was it. It couldn't be a sin to want to help the only other human being alive with him, right? Surely she didn't have to be this cruel, this harsh, to him. All he wanted to do was help. That was it. Just help out a little bit, and she was hurting him. "But I—"  
"真嗣只能震惊地盯着她。他只想帮助她，仅此而已。想要帮助唯一与他共存的另一个人类，这怎么可能是罪呢？她肯定不必对他如此残忍，如此严厉。他只想帮忙，仅此而已。只是想帮一点忙，而她却在伤害他。“但我——””

"Don't speak!" Asuka shrieked, only to vomit out blood once more.  
“别说话！”明日香尖叫道，随即再次吐出鲜血。

"You're—" Shinji was interrupted when Asuka slammed her backhand across his face. He fell against the sandy floor, his face red, his lip bleeding slightly.  
“你——”真嗣话未说完，就被明日香一记反手扇在脸上。他跌倒在沙地上，脸颊通红，嘴唇微微出血。

"This is all your fault," Asuka mumbled, barely able to speak as she quivered in pain, clutching herself as she tried to steady herself, "All your fault. You let them kill me. You let them kill mama. And all you did was just sit there on your ass and listen to them rip me to shreds! You didn't do anything! You could have helped, stopped them from eating me or disemboweling me or stabbing me, but oh no! You chose to come out once I was in shreds! You bastard! You let mama die!"  
"这都是你的错，" 明日香喃喃自语，痛苦得几乎无法言语，她颤抖着，紧紧抱住自己试图稳定下来，"都是你的错。你让他们杀了我。你让他们杀了妈妈。而你只是坐在那里，听着他们把我撕成碎片！你什么都没做！你本可以帮忙，阻止他们吃掉我或开膛破肚或刺伤我，但是哦不！你选择等我被撕成碎片后才出现！你这个混蛋！你让妈妈死了！"

"Mama?" To this day, Shinji had no idea what she was talking about. He assumed she was a little hysterical, maybe even a tad confused, following her death. He wouldn't know. Unlike her, he had never died.  
"妈妈？" 直到今天，真嗣仍不明白她在说什么。他猜想她可能有点歇斯底里，甚至有些混乱，毕竟她刚经历过死亡。他无从得知。与她不同，他从未死过。

Asuka fell to her knees, holding herself weakly as she whispered, softly, "Mama, I'm ready. Please, let's die together. Please. Just this once. Please? I'm ready now, mama."  
明日香跪倒在地，虚弱地抱着自己，轻声细语，"妈妈，我准备好了。请，让我们一起死吧。请。就这一次。好吗？我现在准备好了，妈妈。"

"What's wrong?" “怎么了？”

Shinji woke up, sweating profusely, as he turned to see Asuka, a confused expression on her face, in his bed, not vomiting blood, not hitting him violently, not begging to die with her mother, but just there, staring at him, an eyebrow raised. "Huh? What do you mean by that?" Shinji finally managed to say, knowing full well he must have been tossing and turning in bed.  
真嗣醒来，满头大汗，转身看到明日香在他床上，脸上带着困惑的表情，没有吐血，没有暴力地打他，没有哭喊着要和母亲一起死，只是在那里，盯着他，眉毛一挑。“嗯？你什么意思？”真嗣终于开口说道，他很清楚自己肯定在床上辗转反侧。

"You were fidgeting around. You looked upset, like, really upset. I mean, were you having another flashback or something?"  
“你在床上动来动去的。看起来很不安，真的非常不安。我是说，你是不是又在做噩梦了？”

"Yeah, I guess," Shinji confessed.  
"是啊，我想是吧，" 真嗣坦白道。

"You guess, huh? That just figures. Getting all nostalgic on us once Hikari has a baby. Typical." She sighed, resting a hand on her breasts as she asked, calmly, "So what was it this time?"  
"你只是猜猜，嗯？这很正常。一旦光有了孩子，就开始对我们怀旧。典型的。" 她叹了口气，一手放在胸前，平静地问道，"这次又是什么？"

"I don't remember—" "我不记得了——"

"C'mon! You know you're not going to feel any better unless you talk about it, and besides, what kind of an answer is you don't remember anyway!? That's like freaking telling someone that you heard a really big secret and you said, 'Oh! I can't tell you! It's a secret!' You don't just start talking about something only to stop talking about it five seconds later! It's a freakin' tease!"  
"来吧！你知道不谈出来你不会感觉好些的，再说了，‘我不记得了’这种回答算什么嘛！这就像你听到了一个大秘密，然后说，‘哦！我不能告诉你！这是秘密！’你不能只开了个头，五秒钟后就闭嘴不谈了！这简直是耍人嘛！"

Resigning, he said, simply, "The beach."  
他无奈地叹了口气，简单地说：“海边。”

"Oh, that." Her face deflated somewhat. "That was years ago, and you know it."  
"哦，那个啊。" 她的表情有些泄气。"那是好几年前的事了，你也知道。"

"I know, but still, you were so—"  
"我知道，但还是，你当时那么——"

"You know, these blankets sure are heavy," Asuka interrupted, pulling herself out of bed, "It's getting hot in there."  
"你知道吗，这些毯子确实很重，" 明日香打断道，从床上爬起来，"里面越来越热了。"

"What do you mean? The blankets are perfectly fine," Shinji replied, confused.  
"你什么意思？毯子明明很好啊，" 真嗣回答，感到困惑。"

"Oh, I guess I won't take them off, then," Asuka replied, simply, as she removed her shirt.  
"哦，那我就不脱了。" 明日香简单地回答，同时脱下了她的衬衫。

"What're you doing!?" Shinji stammered, staring at her incredulously.  
"你在干什么！？" 真嗣结结巴巴地说，难以置信地盯着她。

"I'm taking my clothes off, what does it look like?" she replied, simply.  
"我在脱衣服，你看不出来吗？" 她简单地回答。

"Yeah, I can see that, but why!?"  
"是啊，我能理解，但为什么！？"

"Well, if you won't let me take off the blanket, how else do you expect me to cool down?" she asked, simply.  
""好吧，如果你不让我掀开毯子，那你还指望我怎么降温呢？"" 她简单地问道。

"Well—" "嗯——"

"What? Afraid to sleep with a woman without any clothing on?" she teased, in a mocking tone.  
"什么？怕和一个没穿衣服的女人睡觉吗？" 她用嘲弄的语气逗弄道。

Feeling a minor sensation of déjà vu, Shinji replied, indignantly, "No! I'm not afraid! Go ahead and strip! See what I care!"  
感到一丝似曾相识的感觉，真嗣愤愤不平地回答："不！我不怕！尽管脱吧！看我会在乎吗！"

"Okay," she replied, in a surprisingly pleased tone. She ripped the remainder of her clothing off, revealing her naked form, save for her bra and panties. Shinji noticed the long thin scar that ran up her torso. When doctors and hospitals began to return, they had operated on her. It wound up that numerous organs had been damaged. It was a miracle she had survived for weeks on the beach like that. They told her that she must have someone high up looking after her.  
"好吧，" 她以出乎意料的愉快语气回答。她撕掉了剩下的衣服，除了胸罩和内裤外，全身赤裸。真嗣注意到她躯干上那条细长的疤痕。当医生和医院开始恢复运作时，他们为她做了手术。结果发现她的多个器官受损。她能在海滩上存活数周简直是个奇迹。他们告诉她，一定是有位高层在守护着她。

She said it was her mama.  
她说那是她妈妈。

"Okay, now don't think anything dirty or I'll kill you," Asuka replied as she curled up next to Shinji, pressing her cheek to his bosom.  
"好了，现在别想什么乱七八糟的，不然我杀了你，" 明日香一边回答，一边蜷缩在真嗣旁边，将脸颊贴在他的胸膛上。

"Uh—" With that statement, Shinji's eyes focused on his fiancé's cleavage. He couldn't help it! You couldn't just say "Don't think dirty thoughts" and NOT attract a man's attention to those key locations. He hated himself for it, but he couldn't help it. She didn't help situations, either, when she began to glare at him through narrowed eyes, her nails digging into his chest, with a look that clearly expressed her utmost desire to strangle him.  
"呃——" 听到这话，真嗣的目光不由自主地落在了未婚妻的胸前。他控制不住自己！你不能说“别想歪念头”却不引起男人对那些关键部位的注意。他为此感到厌恶自己，但他就是控制不住。她也没让情况好转，当她开始眯起眼睛瞪着他，指甲掐进他的胸口，那眼神明显表达了她最强烈的愿望——掐死他。

"You're thinking something dirty, aren't you?"  
"你在想什么不正经的事，对吧？"

"Sorry?" Shinji replied, inching away slowly from Asuka. He watched as his fiancé's fist rose into the air, through the blankets, as he lightly punched his shoulder.  
"什么？" 真嗣回答道，慢慢地从明日香身边挪开。他看着未婚妻的拳头穿过毯子，轻轻地打在他的肩膀上。

"I'll kill you in the morning, okay?"  
"我明天早上就杀了你，好吗？"

"Alright?" "还好吗？"

"Hey, Shinji?" "嘿，真嗣？"

"Yeah?" "嗯？"

"I'm freezing! Taking off my clothes was not a bright idea. Can I get a little closer?"  
"我快冻僵了！脱掉衣服真不是个好主意。我能靠得近一点吗？"

"Uh, okay." "呃，好吧。"

"Thanks." The German moved closer, inching closer and closer until he could feel her breasts press against his chest, her soft torso pressed up against his, her firm legs wrapped around his, her arms curled around his chest. He always knew that Asuka was about as tall as he was, but to have her up against him like this just proved to him that either he was a small guy or she was a pretty tall woman. After a few moments, she murmured, "Your breath is tickling me."  
"谢谢。" 德国人挪得更近了，一点点靠近，直到他能感觉到她的胸部紧贴着他的胸膛，柔软的身躯紧贴着他，结实的双腿环绕着他，双臂环抱着他的胸膛。他一直知道明日香和他差不多高，但像这样紧贴着他，只是证明了他要么是个小个子，要么她是个相当高的女人。过了一会儿，她低声说："你的呼吸在逗弄我。"

Shinji knew he had experienced this once before. This sounded so oddly familiar, but he just couldn't place the—wait a second! Asuka had said all of this sort of stuff before their first kiss together! She had used some sort of excuse to find themselves into a situation to reach her designated goal, in that case kissing him, goaded him into going her way by calling him afraid, and had even said how Shinji's breath tickled her. The only question is why would do something like that right now? What did she have to gain by stripping almost completely naked in bed with Shinji almost immediately after Hikari had a baby, which could only be created by having—  
真嗣知道他以前经历过这种情况。这听起来如此熟悉，但他就是想不起来——等等！明日香在他们第一次接吻之前说过类似的话！她用某种借口让自己陷入一种情境，以达到她的预定目标，在那次是吻他，用他害怕来激他，甚至还说过真嗣的呼吸逗弄她。唯一的问题是，她现在为什么要这么做？在光莉刚生完孩子之后，她几乎全裸地和真嗣躺在床上，这只能是通过——

Oh.

**Part 3 第三部分**

"Hey! Get back here! Stop crying!"  
嘿！回来！别哭了！

"You know, it's strange seeing you as a mom, Hikari."  
"你知道吗，看到你当妈妈的样子真奇怪，光。"

"You really think so?" "你真的这么觉得？"

It was a shock to see her freckled, brown haired friend as anything other than the class representative she had first met in middle school, a girl who took charge of her classes with her loud, occasionally militaristic orders. Still, Hikari Suzuhara, as Asuka still had to remember was now her full name, looked almost a little comical after a few weeks of being a mom. She was clinging to her little boy, whom Hikari called Shinji, but Asuka called Shin-chan, who was putting up quite a fit. They had changed his diaper, but it looked like he was more interested in something else, specifically the fluid contents of Hikari's plumped breasts.  
看到她这位有着雀斑、棕色头发的朋友，不再是中学时初次见到的那个班级代表，那个以响亮、偶尔带有军事化口吻发号施令的女孩，确实让人震惊。不过，尽管须原光现在已经是她的全名，须原光，但当了几个星期的妈妈后，她看起来几乎有点滑稽。她紧紧抱着她的小男孩，光称他为真嗣，而明日香则叫他真酱，小家伙正在闹脾气。他们刚给他换了尿布，但他似乎对别的东西更感兴趣，特别是光那丰满乳房中的乳汁。

Asuka had to admit that, for a woman who had only given birth a couple weeks ago, she sure had adjusted well to the new situations related to motherhood. Sure, she hadn't lost all the baby fat that she had accumulated while bringing her bouncing rugrat into the world, but she had lost a good deal of it, enough to the point where she looked much like her old self again. With a smile on her face, she pressed her child's lips against her exposed breast, and breastfed him. It was only after a few seconds that she realized that Asuka was in the room with her, watching this somewhat personal moment. Blushing, she said, "Sorry about this."  
"明日香不得不承认，对于一个仅仅几周前才分娩的女人来说，她确实很好地适应了与母亲身份相关的新情况。当然，她还没有完全减掉怀孕期间积累的婴儿肥，但她已经减掉了不少，足以让她看起来又像过去的自己了。她面带微笑，将孩子的嘴唇贴在她裸露的乳房上，开始哺乳。几秒钟后，她才意识到明日香在房间里，正看着这个略显私密的时刻。她脸红了，说道：“抱歉让你看到这个。””

"Hey, don't worry about it. It's natural," she shrugged, "Nothin' awkward about feeding your baby."  
"“嘿，别在意。这是很自然的，”她耸耸肩，“喂宝宝没什么尴尬的。””

"Thanks. Where's Shinji?"  
"“谢谢。真嗣去哪儿了？””

"He's sucking on your—" "他在吸你的——"

"Not that one!" "不是那个！"

"Oh! You mean the idiot! Well, he's at work right now," Asuka replied, scratching her cheek absentmindedly. The idiot. The words seemed to ring off her tongue, almost in an affectionate sort of way, as though she were beating him with a smile on her face. It was strange. Sure, she could be abusive, but he never did leave her, did he? He never did abandon her. Sure, in the past they had their struggles, but now, everything had balanced itself out just about right, hadn't it?  
"哦！你是说那个笨蛋！嗯，他现在在工作，" 明日香回答道，心不在焉地挠了挠脸颊。笨蛋。这个词似乎从她嘴里蹦出来，带着一种近乎宠溺的意味，仿佛她是在笑着揍他。这很奇怪。当然，她可能会很刻薄，但他从未离开过她，不是吗？他从未抛弃过她。没错，过去他们有过争执，但现在，一切都恰到好处地平衡了，不是吗？

"You really like him, don't you?" Hikari replied, smiling.  
"你真的很喜欢他，对吧？" 光笑着回答。

"He's just an idiot," Asuka restated.  
"他就是个白痴，" 明日香重申道。

"Yeah, but he cooks, helps clean around the house while you just laze there eating potato chips," Hikari pointed out.  
"是啊，但他会做饭，还会帮忙打扫家里，而你只是懒洋洋地躺在那里吃薯片，" 光指出。

"Blunt today, are we?" "今天这么迟钝，是吧？"

Hikari giggled again, blushing deep red. "Sorry."  
光再次咯咯笑起来，脸红得深。“对不起。”

"Don't worry about it. Hey, where's that other stooge, Toji?" Asuka hadn't seen him once since she set foot in the Suzuhara residence. It was strange. It wasn't uncommon for Toji to spend time with Shinji while she was here, but at least she saw him. Now it was as though he had been a ghost that had recently been exorcised.  
"别担心。嘿，那个跟班户次去哪儿了？" 明日香自从踏进铃原家就没见过他一次。这很奇怪。户次和真嗣一起度过时间并不罕见，但至少她能看到他。现在他好像是个刚被驱走的鬼魂。

"Well, he's out getting stuff for the baby, or at least that's what he said the moment he heard you were coming," Hikari replied.  
"嗯，他出去给宝宝买东西了，或者至少他是这么说的，就在听说你要来的时候，"光回答道。

"Dummkopf," Asuka murmured, resentfully. That idiot just took off an ran just because of her arrival? What an asshole! He was all fun and games with Shinji, but the moment Shinji's soon-to-be wife arrived, he had to get out of there! Figures. What an asshole. Sure, she wasn't always the sweetest person to him, but still, did he have to prove to her that he was an asshole?  
"笨蛋，"明日香不满地嘟囔着。那个白痴就因为她的到来而跑掉了？真是个混蛋！他和真嗣玩得挺开心的，但真嗣的未婚妻一出现，他就得溜之大吉！真是的。真是个混蛋。没错，她对他并不总是那么友善，但他有必要向她证明自己是个混蛋吗？

"Well, in all fairness, you do have a tendency to yell at him," Hikari said.  
"好吧，公平地说，你确实有对他大吼大叫的倾向，"光说。

"Well, yeah, but that's only when he's being a complete and utter moron."  
"嗯，是的，但那只是当他完全彻底像个白痴的时候。"

"But it's half of the time you're with us?"  
"但那几乎是你和我们在一起的一半时间？"

"Er ist ein Idiot!" Asuka replied, bluntly.  
"他就是个白痴！" 明日香直截了当地回答道。

"Come again?" “再说一遍？”

"He's an idiot!" she replied, a laugh on her tongue, but, midway through her giggle, she clasped her hand on her mouth as she struggled to hold back a sudden wave of nausea, a wave that had hit her without warning, without any previous signs, without any sort of ANYTHING preceding it. She darted to the bathroom, where she knelt down by the toilet seat as she threw it open, lowering her mouth to the open water, waiting for vomit to spill from her mouth.  
“他是个傻瓜！”她笑着回答，但笑声中段，她突然用手捂住嘴，努力抑制住一阵突如其来的恶心感，这感觉毫无预警，没有任何先兆，没有任何前兆。她冲进浴室，跪在马桶前，打开盖子，将头靠近水面，等待着呕吐物的涌出。

Thankfully, after waiting for a few minutes, the sudden urge to vomit faded away, but the nausea hadn't.  
幸运的是，几分钟后，突如其来的呕吐冲动消退了，但恶心感并未消失。

"Hey! Are you alright?" Hikari asked, darting into the room after placing her baby safely into his crib.  
"嘿！你还好吗？" 光问道，将宝宝安全地放进婴儿床后快步走进房间。

"Yeah, just felt a little sick all of a sudden," she replied, holding a hand on her lower belly as she rose to her feet.  
"嗯，只是突然感觉有点不舒服，" 她回答，一手按在腹部下方，缓缓站起身来。

"Are you sick?" "你生病了吗？"

"A little, I think. I'm not sure. This has been happening for the last few days, since last Monday, so I guess I'm just having a stomach virus or something like that, you know? It's nothing to be too worried about. Just a little bit of medicine and—"  
"我觉得有点儿。我不确定。这种情况已经持续了几天，从上周一开始，所以我猜我只是得了胃病毒之类的，你知道吗？没什么好太担心的。吃点药就好了——"

"Uh, are you sure about that?" Hikari asked.  
"呃，你确定吗？" 光问道。

"What do you mean?" "你什么意思？"

"You don't get sick too often," Hikari replied.  
"你不太常生病，" 光回答道。

"Yeah, so this is just one of those infrequent times I'm actually feeling under the—"  
"是啊，所以这只是那些不常见的时刻之一，我其实感觉不太舒服——"

"When was the last time you had your period?"  
"你上次来月经是什么时候？"

"Well—wait a second! Just what're you implying by that!?" snapped Asuka, staring dumbfounded at her friend, her eyes wavering in their sockets.  
"哎——等等！你这话是什么意思！？" 明日香厉声说道，目瞪口呆地盯着她的朋友，眼珠在眼眶里摇摆不定。

"Well, you might be pregnant for all we know," Hikari replied, "I mean, I felt really nauseous, and if you've been feeling nauseous since last Monday, and today's Sunday, that means you've been feeling this way for a week!"  
"嗯，我们也不知道你是不是怀孕了，" 光子回答道，"我是说，我当时感觉非常恶心，如果你从上周一就开始感到恶心，而今天是周日，那就意味着你已经这样持续一周了！"

"So?"

"That's a little more than a few days," Hikari replied, "Look, maybe I'm just jumping to conclusions, but have you and Shinji, er, well, have you—" Asuka's face, which had turned a darker shade of red than the hair on her head, answered Hikari's question for her. "You know, I have a pregnancy test think left over from when I was pregnant. I should probably get that right now."  
"那可不止几天了，" 光子回答道，"听着，也许我只是有点草率下结论，但你和真嗣，呃，嗯，你们有没有——" 明日香的脸，已经红得比她的头发还要深，替她回答了光子的问题。"你知道，我怀孕时还剩了一个验孕棒。我现在应该去拿那个。"

"I'm not pregnant! I'd know if I was pregnant!"  
"我没有怀孕！如果怀孕了我会知道的！"

Shinji was sitting behind his desk, staring up at the ceiling as he always did during these slow days. The fact that he was a former pilot of the Evangelion seemed to be enough reason for him to be given a job at NERV, but the fact that he had been assigned as one of the heads of the newly instated NERV seemed a little extreme. He wasn't a soldier, didn't know anything about the new society, which had focused itself on militaristic defense and the aid of nations throughout the world who were recovering after the horrors of Third Impact. His job essentially meant working out peace treaties between nations NERV seemed to like, proposing to his superiors to veto other peace treaties in order to eliminate cruel and abusive governments, and, of course, searching for souls returning from the sea of LCL, which had shrunk in the years following Third Impact. It had shrunk from a massive planet-sized ocean to a sea located near the Tigris and Eurphrates Rivers, where, according to the numerous religious cults that had sprang up following the horrors of Instrumentality, that the Abrahamic Bible designated that the Garden of Eden existed.  
真嗣坐在办公桌后，像往常一样盯着天花板发呆。他曾是 EVA 驾驶员，这似乎足以让他获得在 NERV 工作的资格，但被任命为新成立的 NERV 高层之一，似乎有些过头了。他不是军人，对新社会一无所知，这个社会已经转向军事防御，并帮助世界各地从第三次冲击的恐怖中恢复过来的国家。他的工作基本上是协调 NERV 喜欢的国家之间的和平条约，向他的上级提议否决其他和平条约以消除残酷和虐待的政府，当然，还要寻找从 LCL 之海归来的灵魂，这个海在第三次冲击后的几年里已经缩小了。它从覆盖整个行星的巨大海洋缩小到位于底格里斯河和幼发拉底河附近的一个海，根据第三次冲击后涌现的众多宗教团体所说，那里是圣经中指定的伊甸园所在地。

Garden of Eden? What a joke.  
伊甸园？真是笑话。

The phone at his desk rang. As he answered it, he expected to hear his superiors on the other line. "Hello, this is Shinji Ikari speaking." He expected some order, some new job for him to handle. However, he DIDN'T expect a high pitched female voice to shout at him from the top of her lungs, a voice so loud that she had to draw the phone at least an arm's length away from his ear to actually hear properly.  
他桌上的电话响了。他接起电话，以为会听到上级的声音。“你好，我是碇真嗣。”他以为会接到什么命令，有什么新任务要处理。然而，他万万没想到会是一个尖锐的女性声音从电话那头尖叫出来，声音大到他不得不把电话至少拿开一臂之遥才能听清楚。

"You stupid idiot! How could you?! You stupid, stupid, jerk! You disgusting pervert, I should've never trusted you for a second! Schwein! Dummkopf! Bastard! Seducer! Schmutz der Erde!"  
“你这个大笨蛋！你怎么能这样？！你这个蠢货，蠢货，混蛋！你这个恶心的变态，我真不该相信你哪怕一秒钟！猪！傻瓜！混账！诱骗者！地球上的污垢！”

"Wait, just hold on a second Asuka—!"  
"等等，先别急，明日香——！"

"Don't you just tell me to hold on a second, you stupid idiot!"  
"别跟我说什么等一下，你这个大笨蛋！"

"Just what're you yelling about?"  
"你到底在嚷嚷什么？"

"Oh! Don't act like you don't know you idiot!"  
"哦！别装作你不知道，你这个白痴！"

"I don't know! You just started yelling at me and—" Shinji was interrupted when the door opened. In walked the elderly Commander Fuyutsuki, a man who had miraculously managed to keep his job, no, be promoted to head of NERV following the controversy NERV received following Third Impact.  
""我不知道！你突然对我大吼大叫，然后——"" 真嗣的话被开门声打断了。走进来的是年迈的指挥官冬月，一个在第三次冲击引发的争议后奇迹般保住职位，甚至被提拔为 NERV 负责人的男人。

"Ikari-san, we have—" "碇君，我们有——"

"Don't you just play stupid and act like the innocent little oaf everyone thinks you are! Schwein!"  
"别装傻充愣，表现得像大家以为的那个无辜小傻瓜一样！猪头！"

"On second thought, I'll leave you two alone." Fuyutsuki backed out of the room, closed the door over, and, if Shinji's ears didn't deceive him, sprinted as far away from the room as possible.  
"再一想，我还是让你们俩单独待着吧。" 冬月退出了房间，关上门，而且，如果真嗣的耳朵没听错的话，他飞快地跑得离房间越远越好。

Why did he have to leave him alone with this insanity?  
为什么他非得把他一个人留在这疯狂之中？

"But what's going on? I don't understand what's happening."  
"但这是怎么回事？我不明白发生了什么。"

On the other side of the line, Shinji could hear a second voice speak. He barely made out, "Asuka, let me speak to him for a second. You're being hysterical!" only to have the rest of Hikari Suzuhara's interruption blocked out by more of his fiancé's shouting.  
电话那头，真嗣能听到另一个声音说话。他勉强听出，"明日香，让我跟他说几句。你太激动了！"但随后铃原光希的打断被他未婚妻更多的喊叫声淹没了。

"You made me—you made me—"  
"你让我——你让我——"

"Made you what?" "让你什么？"

"Pregnant!" "怀孕了！"

Shinji stared at the phone for a moment or two, confused. Pregnant? Oh, wasn't that supposed to be a joyous event, filled with smiling and laughter, with a deeper connection of love and passion, without shouting and screaming? Why did everything have to be painful? "Uh, congratulations?"  
真嗣盯着手机愣了一会儿，感到困惑。怀孕？哦，那不应该是充满欢笑和喜悦，伴随着更深层次的爱与激情，而不是争吵和尖叫吗？为什么一切都如此痛苦？“呃，恭喜？”

"Don't you 'congratulations' me, you jerk! You made me pregnant! You seducing little—"  
"别跟我说'恭喜'，你这个混蛋！你让我怀孕了！你这个勾引人的小——"

"Seducing? I didn't seduce you!"  
"勾引？我可没勾引你！"

"Well, what about a few weeks ago when you essentially raped me in your bed? Hmmm?"  
"那几周前，你在床上几乎强奸了我，这又怎么说？嗯？"

"Raped you? What the hell are you talking about? You went into the bed with no clothing on and we made love!"  
"强奸你？你到底在说什么鬼话？你一丝不挂地上了床，我们明明是做爱了！"

"Oh, don't use that old blame me routine of yours! You need to accept responsibility for your actions, you jerk!"  
"哦，别再用你那老一套的怪罪我的伎俩了！你得为自己的行为负责，你这个混蛋！"

"How about you accept responsibilities for once? You went into a bed wearing nothing!"  
"你怎么不承担一次责任？你可是赤裸裸地上了床！"

"I was too wearing something!"  
"我确实穿了什么！"

"You were wearing panties and a bra, and were using the same tactics you used when we were kids when you made me kiss you! What was I supposed to think!?"  
"你只穿了内裤和胸罩，还用了我们小时候你让我亲你时的那套战术！我还能怎么想！？"

"Oh, don't use that old excuse on me again!"  
"哦，别再用那个老借口糊弄我了！"

"When was the last time I ever made that excuse before, anyway?"  
"话说回来，我上次用这个借口是什么时候了？"

"Oh! Don't change the subject!"  
"哦！别转移话题！"

"I didn't!" "我没有！"

"Oh, you stupid—Hey! Hikari! What're you—?"  
"哦，你这个笨蛋——嘿！光！你在——？"

The other end of the line began to ruffle and tremble. Shinji drew the phone closer to his ear, sure to hear Hikari's voice as opposed to Asuka's high pitched shrill. Thankfully, his expectations were fulfilled. "Hey, listen, don't mind her, she's just a little upset right now. She'll cool off once she adjusts to everything."  
电话那头开始沙沙作响，颤抖起来。真嗣将手机贴近耳朵，希望能听到光的温柔声音，而不是明日香那尖锐的嗓音。幸运的是，他的期望得到了满足。“嘿，听着，别在意她，她只是现在有点不高兴。等她适应了一切，就会冷静下来的。”

"Uh, okay." Cool off? He hoped that happened soon. If Asuka was upset with him, chances are he wouldn't even be let into the house, left outside of a barricaded door in the dark. The weatherman forecasted thunderstorms, too. "Listen, uh, how did you guys find out she was pregnant, exactly?"  
"呃，好吧。"冷静下来？他希望这能尽快发生。如果明日香对他生气了，很可能他连家门都进不去，只能被关在门外，在黑暗中面对紧闭的大门。天气预报还说会有雷暴。“听着，呃，你们是怎么知道她怀孕的，确切地说？”

"A pregnancy test." "一支验孕棒。"

"Oh, uh, how accurate is it?"  
"哦，呃，它的准确度如何？"

"Pretty accurate." "相当准确。"

"I see. Uh, thanks, Hikari."  
"我明白了。呃，谢谢，光。"

"Don't mention it." "不用谢。"

"I'm going to hang up now—"  
"我现在要挂电话了——"

"Dummkopf! Don't you dare hang up on me you idiot!" Shinji pulled the phone away from his ear in shock, staring at it, his eyes wide with fear, as though the wires would come alive to strangle him.  
"笨蛋！你敢挂我电话，你这个白痴！" 真嗣震惊地将电话从耳边拉开，盯着它，眼中满是恐惧，仿佛电线会活过来勒死他。

"I'm at work! I can't keep talking on the phone! I have to hang up now!"  
"我在上班！不能一直讲电话！我现在得挂了！"

"I hope they fire you, you son of a—" Shinji slammed the receiver down, exhaling slowly as he leaned back in his chair, staring up at the ceiling once more.  
"我希望他们炒了你，你个混蛋——" 真嗣猛地挂上听筒，缓缓呼气，靠回椅背，再次抬头望向天花板。

Pregnant? 怀孕了？

A child? 一个孩子？

Asuka? 明日香？

Father. 父亲。
