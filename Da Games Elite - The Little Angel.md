What you are about to read is in no way connected to my previous Fan-Fiction, "In the Case of Asuka Langley Sohryu," which I still recommend you read because, in my opinion, I think it touches upon a certain aspect of the series that people usually don't touch upon: why don't these damn kids just get psychologists to help them with their problems? Well, that not withstanding, I've wanted to find fan-fics where Asuka and Shinji finally confront the horrors of parenthood, and considering just what their parents were like, one having a rather cold and distant father and the other's mother committing suicide in front of her eyes, it left much potential not only to do a great Asuka fan-fic, but also a great Shinji fan-fic as well. Naturally, considering the subject matter, there will be several OCs, but they'll mostly be children.  
你即将阅读的内容与我之前的同人小说《浅谈惣流·明日香·兰格雷的个案》并无任何关联，我仍推荐你阅读，因为在我看来，它触及了该系列中人们通常不涉及的一个方面：这些孩子为何不寻求心理学家帮助解决他们的问题？尽管如此，我一直想找到关于明日香和真嗣最终直面育儿恐怖的同人作品，考虑到他们的父母分别是怎样的人——一个有着冷漠疏离的父亲，另一个的母亲则在眼前自杀，这不仅为创作一部优秀的明日香同人提供了广阔空间，也为真嗣同人开辟了同样广阔的可能性。当然，鉴于主题，会有一些原创角色，但大部分会是孩子。

WARNING: Despite being rated T, there is a very mild, PG-13 level sex scene in the next chapter. This is not a lemon, not a hentai, and the sex will barely count as ecchi. It's more essentially to show the beauty of the human body, and just how two certain characters get into this situation in the first place. If you feel uncomfortable about it, gloss over it. If you're into that sort of stuff, like lemons, I'm sorry, but I want this to reach the general audience.  
警告：尽管评级为 T，下一章中包含一个非常温和的 PG-13 级别性爱场景。这不是柠檬文，不是 hentai，性爱内容几乎算不上是 ecchi。其主要目的是展现人体之美，以及两位特定角色是如何陷入这种情境的。如果你对此感到不适，可以选择略过。如果你喜欢柠檬文这类内容，很抱歉，但我希望这部作品能面向更广泛的读者。

So, without further adieu…  
那么，不再多说……
