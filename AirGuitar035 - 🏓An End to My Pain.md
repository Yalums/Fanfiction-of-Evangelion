Piloting EVA has done nothing but cause Shinji pain, suffering and heartache. So one night, he decides that maybe it's okay to run away one last time... (One-shot)  
驾驶 EVA 带给真嗣的只有痛苦、折磨和心碎。于是某个夜晚，他决定或许最后一次逃离也是可以的……

Shinji Ikari sat in the solitary cell he'd been escorted to after he'd been pulled from Unit-01. On his hands, he could still feel... _everything_. Bones cracking, flesh tearing, ligaments and tendons stretching and snapping, blood smearing, metal deforming... _crunching_ between his fingers_..._ the Dummy Plug system took away all conscious control of Unit-01, but all the nerve impulses had been left on, meaning Shinji felt everything that Unit-01 did after his father ordered the Dummy Plug to be activated. He couldn't feel sick anymore; he'd already emptied his stomach into the toilet. He couldn't cry anymore; his eyes wouldn't produce tears anymore. Instead, he sat on the slab that served as his bed and let his anger build.  
碇真嗣坐在被从初号机中拖出后被押送至的孤寂牢房里。他的双手仍能感受到一切：骨头碎裂，血肉撕扯，韧带与肌腱拉伸断裂，血液涂抹，金属变形……在他指间嘎吱作响……傀儡系统剥夺了初号机的一切意识控制，但所有的神经冲动都被保留了下来，这意味着在父亲命令激活傀儡系统后，真嗣感受到了初号机所经历的一切。他已无法再感到恶心；他的胃早已在马桶中清空。他已无法再哭泣；他的双眼已流不出泪水。相反，他坐在充当床铺的石板上，任由怒火在心中积聚。

He'd taken a lot of shit since he was drafted as a pilot, but this was unforgivable. _His own father_ had used Shinji against his own will to brutalize his best friend, and Shinji would _not_ let this go unpunished. He had to do _something_ to get back at his father, and it didn't take him long to decide what he'd do. He stewed for a few more hours in solitary before a Section 2 agent came to bring him to the Commander's office. Shinji was marched into Gendo Ikari's office in a triple set of handcuffs, and it took a minute before any of the two of them spoke.  
自从被征召为驾驶员以来，他遭受了不少非议，但这次是不可原谅的。自己的父亲竟然利用真嗣的意愿，残忍地伤害了他最好的朋友，真嗣绝不会就此罢休。他必须做些什么来报复父亲，而且他很快就决定了该怎么做。在单独监禁中又熬了几个小时后，一名第二分部的特工来带他去指挥官的办公室。真嗣被三副手铐铐着，押进了碇源堂的办公室，两人沉默了一会儿才开口。

"Disobeying orders, using an EVA for personal vendettas, childish intimidation. These are all criminal offences. Do you have anything to say?"  
“违抗命令，利用 EVA 进行私人恩怨，幼稚的恐吓。这些都是犯罪行为。你有什么要说的吗？”

The clinical tone Gendo used grated on Shinji's nerves, and he took a breath in to say the words he had prepared in his head for hours.  
碇源堂那冷漠的语气让真嗣感到烦躁，他深吸一口气，准备说出脑海中酝酿了数小时的话语。

"Yes. I don't want to pilot an EVA anymore. And I don't want to stay here either."  
"是的。我不想再驾驶 EVA 了。我也不想留在这里。"

"Well then, you may leave."  
"那么，你可以离开了。"

The utter nonchalance in his father's fueled Shinji's hatred even further. "Yes, father," he spat. Shinji was about to say something about how he might return to his old teacher's home, but he held his tongue. He still had something left to do. He turned to leave when his father's voice stopped him again.  
父亲那完全漠不关心的态度让真嗣的恨意更甚。“是的，父亲，”他咬牙切齿地说。真嗣本想说他会回到以前的老师家，但他忍住了。他还有事情要做。当他转身要走时，父亲的声音再次让他停下脚步。

"You're running away again. You disappoint me. I assume that we will never meet again."  
"你又在逃避了。你让我失望了。我想我们不会再见面了。"

Shinji didn't even bother to turn his head. "Yes, I hope not." He walked a few more steps and exited his father's office. Outside, a Section 2 agent unlocked his handcuffs and just... left. That was classic Section 2 competency. Shinji made his way through the maze of hallways that NERV had always been. Before going to the exit, though, he made a few detours to where he needed to go; the Geofront hospital. One of the nurses pointed out a specific room for Shinji when he asked.  
真嗣连头都懒得回。“是的，我希望如此。”他又走了几步，离开了父亲的办公室。外面，一名第二支部特工解开了他的手铐，然后就……走了。这就是第二支部的典型作风。真嗣穿过 NERV 一贯错综复杂的走廊。但在离开之前，他绕了几个弯，前往他需要去的地方：地底都市的医院。当他询问时，一位护士为他指出了一个特定的房间。

Shinji made his way to the door of the room, and slowly entered, trying to keep calm as he imagined what he'd say to Toji, and what he'd say to him. Shinji didn't know anything about his condition. He was pretty sure he blacked out for a few minutes after the fight, but he was able to barely make out Toji's face as emergency crews pulled him out of the plug. In the room, there was only a single bed surrounded by curtains, obscuring the boy who laid in it. The whirring, beeping, and humming of various machines did little to settle Shinji's nerves. So with great trepidation, he closed the gap and drew the curtains back.  
真嗣走到房间门口，缓缓进入，试图保持冷静，想象着他会如何对东治说话，以及他会说些什么。真嗣对东治的状况一无所知。他很确定自己在战斗后昏迷了几分钟，但他勉强能辨认出急救人员将东治从插入栓中拉出的面孔。房间里只有一张被窗帘围绕的床，遮住了躺在上面的人。各种机器的嗡嗡声、哔哔声和轰鸣声几乎无法平复真嗣的紧张情绪。于是，他带着极大的忧虑，拉开了窗帘。

...and promptly vomited on the floor.  
...然后立刻在地板上吐了出来。

Toji was unrecognizable. He was utterly comatose, concussed, and reliant on a ventilator to breathe. He was covered in bruises, bloody gashes, and had more bandages showing than skin. What was visible of his face was indented in ways a human face wasn't meant to. Perhaps the most grisly part was that he was missing his left arm and leg, with bloody bandages tightly wrapped around the stumps. His remaining limbs were sharply broken at various angles. Toji was experiencing a fate worse than death, and it was all because Shinji refused to act in time. Any hint of the defiant young man who stood up to Gendo Ikari just a few minutes ago was gone in an instant. The overwhelming guilt combined with the horrifying visuals was enough to send Shinji running out of Toji's room as fast as his legs would carry him.  
真嗣已经面目全非。他完全昏迷，脑震荡严重，依赖呼吸机维持呼吸。他浑身是瘀伤、血淋淋的伤口，绷带比皮肤还多。他脸上可见的部分扭曲得不像一张人脸。最可怕的是，他失去了左臂和左腿，残肢上紧紧缠着血迹斑斑的绷带。剩下的四肢以各种尖锐的角度断裂。真嗣正遭受着比死亡更悲惨的命运，这一切都是因为绫波零没有及时采取行动。几分钟前还敢于反抗碇源堂的那个倔强少年，瞬间消失得无影无踪。巨大的内疚感加上这恐怖的景象，足以让绫波零以最快的速度逃离真嗣的房间。

The old men of SEELE were not at all pleased upon hearing the news that the Third Child, one of the most important pieces in their plan for Instrumentality, had just decided to up and leave NERV. They compared his actions to that of a small toddler that would hide from its mother upon doing something they should've known was wrong. However, they knew that they'd somehow get their pawn back, and the old men simply decided to wait for the imminent arrival of Zeruel, as foretold in the Dead Sea Scrolls.  
听到第三适格者，即他们实现人类补完计划中至关重要的一环，刚刚决定离开 NERV 的消息，SEELE 的老人们丝毫不感欣慰。他们将他的行为比作一个做了明知不该做的事后，会躲开母亲的小孩。然而，他们深知终将设法让这枚棋子归位，于是老人们决定静候死海文书所预言的，Zeruel 的即将到来。

An arrival which, to their shock and surprise, did _not_ happen as foretold. Weeks passed since the incident with Unit-03, now officially designated as the Angel Bardiel. School was closed during this time while infrastructure was rebuilt. Everyone at NERV was not happy with Shinji's decision to leave, likening it to a soldier deserting his post in wartime. Misato took to drinking openly at all hours of the day, including on-duty, due to her lingering injuries from the Matsushiro explosion, and to deal with the fact that she'd lost her best pilot and failed Shinji by not telling him about Toji's pilot status. She consumed a staggering amount of beer per day, and constantly smelled of Yebisu. Shinji was surprised that she hadn't turned her liver to stone or given herself alcohol poisoning yet. Toji remained in the coma his ordeal had left him in. And Shinji agonized over Toji, being the master overthinker that he was.  
一个本应如期而至的到来，却令他们震惊与意外地未能发生。自三号机事件以来，已过去数周，该事件现正式定性为天使 Bardiel。期间学校停课，基础设施得以重建。NERV 内部对真嗣擅自离队的决定颇为不满，将其比作战时逃兵。由于松代爆炸留下的伤痛及未能告知真嗣关于东治驾驶员身份的失败，美里开始不分昼夜地酗酒，甚至在执勤时也不例外。她每日狂饮大量啤酒，浑身散发着 Yebisu 的气息，真嗣惊讶于她竟未因此肝硬化或酒精中毒。东治仍深陷于那场磨难带来的昏迷之中，而真嗣，作为一位过度思考的主宰者，则痛苦地牵挂着东治。

Weeks turned into a month-and-a-half later, and Shinji finally decided that enough was enough, and that he'd finally go see his friend once again, since he'd should have recovered more. He'd accept whatever came of the visit, whether Toji decided to yell at him, or not speak to him at all, or even if, on a very slim chance that he decided to forgive Shinji, he'd accept it just like he'd accepted everything else that had happened to him since he'd arrived in Tokyo-3. He managed to convince a drunken Misato to help him get into the Geofront hospital, since his NERV credentials were revoked when he decided to quit. He felt a bit bad, as if he were taking advantage of her, but this was something he owed to Toji. He quietly navigated his way through the halls towards the room that contained Toji. He kept his head down the entire way; no one seemed to recognize him. Finally, Shinji's feet brought him to outside the closed door that went into Toji's room. He paused for a moment, and steeled himself for whatever he expected to come next, whether it be a vicious chewing-out or the silent treatment from Toji, he'd take what was coming to him. Shinji took a deep breath and gently opened the door to enter.  
几周过去了一个半月，真嗣终于下定决心，不能再这样下去了，他该去看看朋友，毕竟他应该恢复得差不多了。无论这次探望会带来什么后果，无论是被东治大骂一顿，还是完全不理睬他，甚至极小概率地，东治决定原谅他，他都会接受，就像他自来到第三新东京市以来接受的一切。他设法说服了醉酒的美里帮他进入地底都市的医院，因为自从他决定辞职后，他的 NERV 证件就被吊销了。他感到有些内疚，仿佛在利用她，但这是他欠东治的。他默默地在走廊中穿行，向着东治所在的病房走去。一路上他始终低着头，似乎没有人认出他。最终，真嗣的脚步停在了通往东治房间的紧闭门前。他停顿片刻，为自己即将面对的一切做好心理准备，无论是东治的严厉斥责还是沉默对待，他都准备接受即将到来的一切。 真嗣深吸一口气，轻轻推开门走了进去。

Shinji took a few steps in and froze. What he found was not at all what he expected. The bed that Toji had previously occupied was totally empty, and clean freshly-pressed sheets had been placed on the bed. The curtains and all of the machines that once surrounded the bed to keep Toji alive were gone. The room as a whole felt... sterile.  
真嗣走了几步便僵住了。眼前的一切完全出乎他的意料。原本东治躺过的病床空空如也，取而代之的是崭新熨烫过的床单。窗帘和曾经围绕病床维持东治生命的那些机器都不见了。整个房间给人一种……无菌的感觉。

There was also somebody sitting in the chair next to the bed, lightly dozing. Shinji recognized the occupant as Hikari Horaki, and his heart sank. Her breathing was shallow and slightly hitched, as if she was crying as she slept. Shinji clammed up, and didn't even notice the door softly click shut behind him. However, that was enough to jolt Hikari out of her sleep, and out of her chair to her feet. The poor girl hadn't had much of a rest at all. All Shinji could do was stay rooted in place as Hikari turned to where the disturbance came from and laid puffy, bloodshot eyes on him.  
床边椅子上还坐着一个人，轻打着盹。真嗣认出那是洞木光，心头一沉。她的呼吸浅而急促，似乎在睡梦中也在哭泣。真嗣沉默不语，甚至没注意到身后的门轻轻关上了。然而，这足以惊醒洞木，她从椅子上猛地站起身来。可怜的女孩根本没怎么休息。真嗣只能呆立原地，看着洞木转向声音来源，用红肿充血的眼睛盯着他。

"C-Class Rep... Hika-" "C 级代表...光-

"...how could you?" "...你怎么能这样？"

Those three words ripped all the breath from Shinji's lungs. How could he possibly respond to that? His eyes widened progressively as she continued.  
这三个字仿佛抽走了真嗣肺里所有的空气。他该如何回应呢？随着她继续说下去，他的眼睛逐渐睁大。

"T-Toji... told me he was going to be a pilot... he just w-wanted to help his sister get better... he was so excited that he'd be able to b-b-back you up, and keep us all _safe, but you didn't even HELP HIM! YOU DIDN'T EVEN TRY, DID YOU?! YOU JUST TORE HIM APART! YOU TOOK HIM AWAY FROM HIS **SISTER**, YOU TOOK HIM AWAY FROM OUR **CLASS**,**YOU TOOK HIM AWAY FROM ME! HOW COULD YOU DO THIS, SHINJI?! HOW COULD YOU?!**_"  
"T-Toji... 告诉我他要成为一名驾驶员... 他只是想帮助他妹妹康复... 他那么兴奋，以为能支援你，保护我们大家，但你甚至没有帮助他！你甚至没有尝试，对吧？！你只是把他撕碎了！你从他妹妹身边夺走了他，从我们班上夺走了他，从我身边夺走了他！你怎么能这样做，真嗣？！你怎么能？！"

Hikari crossed the gap between the two of them as her volume increased and stopped with her face about a foot from Shinji's. Her tears started anew as she drew in very heavy and very shaky breaths. But Shinji's mouth couldn't produce any answers, not while he tried to process everything he'd just heard. Toji was... gone? Hadn't anyone told Hikari that his EVA was contaminated by the-  
随着音量的提高，光子跨越了两人之间的距离，停在离真嗣的脸大约一英尺的地方。她的泪水再次涌出，呼吸变得沉重而颤抖。但真嗣的嘴无法给出任何答案，因为他正试图处理刚刚听到的一切。Toji... 走了吗？难道没有人告诉光子他的 EVA 被污染了吗——

"_GODDAMN IT, SAY **SOMETHING!**_"  
"该死的，说点什么！"

Hikari punctuated her statement with a sharp backhand to Shinji's face that knocked him on his ass. Shinji looked up at Hikari in pure terror. He'd seen Hikari angry before, but that was mostly due to the Class Rep persona she used to keep order in their class. He knew that at her core, Hikari was a very kind and reasonable girl. What Shinji was seeing now was _far_ beyond anything he'd ever seen from her before. In her eyes, all he saw was pure, unadulterated fury and pain. A burning fire like a supernova. And Shinji just... couldn't bring himself to give her an answer. He averted his eyes in shame.  
光用一记猛烈的反手扇击终结了她的陈述，将真嗣打翻在地。真嗣惊恐地抬头望向光。他以前见过光生气，但那大多是因为她作为班长的身份，为了维持班级秩序。他知道，光本质上是一个非常善良和讲理的女孩。但此刻他所见到的，远超以往任何时候。在她的眼中，他只看到了纯粹、未加掩饰的愤怒与痛苦。如同超新星般炽烈的火焰。而真嗣...却无法鼓起勇气给她一个回答。他羞愧地移开了视线。

"...he never woke up, you know? H-he never... h-heard..."  
“……他再也没有醒来，你知道吗？他从未……听……”

Hikari's voice began to crack, and she rushed out of the room before a fresh round of sobs could overtake her. Shinji stayed on the floor for a couple more minutes, forgetting about the blazing pain across his right cheek while trying to parse the events that occurred. Toji, one of Shinji's closest (and only) friends in Tokyo-3, was dead. Dead because he refused to fight back when the Angel had its claws around his throat. And now, Toji's sister and father would be lonelier than ever because of that.  
光的声音开始颤抖，她冲出房间，以免新一轮的哭泣再次袭来。真嗣又在地板上多待了几分钟，忘记了右颊上灼热的疼痛，试图理清刚刚发生的一切。他在东京-3 最亲密（也是唯一的）朋友之一，冬二，已经死了。因为他在天使的利爪环绕喉咙时拒绝反击而丧命。如今，冬二的妹妹和父亲将比以往任何时候都更加孤独。

Shinji took his time getting home that night. When he walked in the door, the sun was just disappearing over the horizon and the first few stars were winking into sight. The apartment was dark and totally quiet except for Misato snoring away, slumped over the dining room table with a Yebisu in one hand and several empties scattered on the surface. Shinji grimaced, and crept over to the table to clear away the mess. Shinji noted the phone just beyond Misato's reach and deduced that she was probably about to dial up Section 2 to find him. He dealt with the mess, then went to Misato and swept her hair that had fallen into her face away, laying a tentative hand on her shoulder before walking away to his room. He hated how she drank all the time now, but he didn't have any other ideas for her to ease her pain. Matsushiro really did a number on her. Shinji slowly got dressed in his sleeping attire and curled up on his futon with his SDAT. Within a few minutes he was asleep while his mind swirled with the events of the day.  
那天晚上，真嗣回家时走得很慢。当他进门时，太阳刚刚沉入地平线，最初的几颗星星开始闪烁出现。公寓里一片漆黑，异常安静，除了美里在餐厅桌上打着呼噜，一手拿着 Yebisu 啤酒，桌上散落着几个空瓶。真嗣皱了皱眉，悄悄走过去清理那堆乱七八糟的东西。他注意到电话就在美里够不到的地方，推测她可能正要拨打第二课的电话找他。他处理了那堆杂物，然后走到美里身边，轻轻拂去她脸上散落的头发，犹豫地把手放在她肩上，随后走向自己的房间。他讨厌她现在总是喝酒，但他也没有其他办法帮她缓解痛苦。松代的事对她打击太大了。真嗣慢慢换上睡衣，蜷缩在床垫上，手里拿着 SDAT。几分钟内他就陷入了沉睡，脑海中萦绕着一天的种种事件。

Shinji's sleep was not a restful one, in any way. He tossed and turned as his head filled with memories of the fight with the Angel, the feelings of the Angel's fingers tightening around his throat, the red light flooding the Entry Plug, the Dummy Plug overriding all of Unit-01's movement, the still-connected nerve impulses allowing Shinji to feel the heat of the Angel's blood, and the flesh and bone cracking and tearing beneath his hands as he cowered in the Plug. The way _Toji's face_ gave way underneath the crimson-stained fists of the purple EVA, indenting and cratering with each punch. _Toji's limbs_ being ripped from his torso, the joints popping loose and the tendons and nerves snapping as they each tore away. _Toji's blood_ geysering all over the city, painting nearly every building on the Tokyo-3 skyline. _Toji's **screams**_ as he felt it all happen, _begging_ for a mercy that never came_._  
真嗣的睡眠绝非安稳，丝毫如此。他辗转反侧，脑海中充斥着与使徒战斗的记忆：使徒手指紧扼喉咙的感觉，插入栓内泛滥的红光，模拟插入栓接管初号机所有动作，神经连接未断让他感受到使徒血液的炽热，以及双手下肉骨撕裂的声音，他在插入栓中瑟缩着。东治的脸在紫色 EVA 染血的拳头下崩塌，每一拳都留下凹陷与坑洞。东治的四肢被从躯干上撕扯下来，关节松脱，肌腱神经断裂，每撕离一处都发出脆响。东治的鲜血如喷泉般洒遍城市，几乎染红了东京-3 天际线的每一座建筑。东治感受着这一切发生的惨叫，乞求着未曾到来的慈悲。

Shinji shot up to a sitting position, barely holding back a scream. He panted heavily for a bit, and sat staring at his wall as he caught his breath and tried to clear his mind of the images it had created. It wasn't the first time he'd woken up in this fashion; he'd started having this nightmare after the first time he saw Toji in the hospital after the Angel attacked, and now it was the only thing he saw whenever he closed his eyes. Sleep didn't come back to Shinji that night.  
真嗣猛地坐起身来，勉强忍住了尖叫。他重重地喘息了一会儿，坐在那里盯着墙壁，试图平复呼吸并清除脑海中浮现的那些画面。这不是他第一次这样醒来；自从第一次在天使袭击后在医院见到冬治以来，他就一直在做这个噩梦，现在只要他一闭上眼睛，眼前就只有这个梦。那一晚，真嗣再也没有睡着。

---

A few days later, school was reopened, and Shinji was terrified of what he'd be walking into when he returned.  
几天后，学校重新开学，真嗣害怕自己回去时会面对什么。

The day after he'd been to the NERV hospital, he'd asked Misato if people knew about the Angel that had possessed Unit-03. Misato's slightly slurred reply was that there was a media blackout on anything Angel related. If the public knew that an Angel could possess an EVA, then they'd speculate that it could happen to any one of them, and the ramifications from that would be anything but good. If NERV found anything reported that insinuated Angel possession, it was shut down, and the media outlets were given a cover story that there had been a severe malfunction in the new EVA unit, and that the attempted recovery had been a massive failure, and their only option was to terminate the Unit. The logical thing to do was to keep the civilians in the Angel shelters since that was the safest place for them. And of course, the Dummy Plug system was heavily classified, so the media never learned a whisper about it.  
他去过 NERV 医院后的第二天，便向美里询问是否有人知晓那只附身于零三号机使徒的事情。美里略带含糊的回答是，所有与使徒相关的新闻都被媒体封锁了。如果公众得知使徒能附身于 EVA，他们便会猜测这可能发生在任何一台 EVA 上，而由此引发的后果绝非好事。一旦 NERV 发现有报道暗示使徒附身的情况，便会立即封杀，并向媒体提供一套说辞：新 EVA 单位发生了严重故障，尝试回收的行动彻底失败，唯一的选择就是销毁该单位。最合理的做法是将平民安置在使徒避难所，因为那里对他们来说最为安全。当然，Dummy Plug 系统属于高度机密，媒体从未得到过一丝风声。

All that meant was that everyone who watched or read the news believed that NERV had let Unit-03 be torn to shreds, and shown absolutely no mercy. And when it was remembered that the EVAs were all piloted by humans, public opinion of NERV went south. Both for the loss of human life that had occurred on their watch, and that it was another human that had committed the graphic atrocity. The public never knew that the pilots were children, so they were downright merciless with their words for the pilot of the purple titan which had painted Tokyo-3 red, forgetting just how many times that the EVAs had saved them and the world at large. The only saving grace was that the pilots identities remained anonymous to the media.  
这意味着所有观看或阅读新闻的人都相信，NERV 任由三号机被撕成碎片，毫不留情。而当人们想起 EVA 都是由人类驾驶时，NERV 的公众形象便一落千丈。不仅因为他们在眼皮底下发生了人命损失，更因为实施这一残忍行径的也是人类。公众并不知道驾驶员是孩子，因此对那位驾驶紫色巨人、将第三新东京市染红的驾驶员口诛笔伐，全然忘记了 EVA 曾多次拯救他们及整个世界。唯一值得庆幸的是，驾驶员的身份对媒体仍保持匿名。

Shinji trudged to class, not feeling better about public anonymity, since _everyone_ at school knew he was the pilot of Unit-01, so they'd know that he was at least involved in the Unit-03 disaster. And indeed, he got a lot of looks and stares as he made his way through the halls. The only thing he had going for him was that Hikari was the only one who knew about Toji's pilot status. When he got to the class doorway, his heart broke a bit when he saw that she wasn't at her desk. Toji's death hit her hard. The deputy class rep, whose name escaped Shinji at this moment, was doing his best to get the class seated before the bell went. He paused when he glanced Shinji out of the corner of his eye and rounded on him.  
真嗣拖着沉重的步伐走向教室，对于公众的匿名性并未感到好转，因为学校里每个人都知道他是初号机的驾驶员，因此他们肯定知道他至少与三号机灾难有关。确实，他在走廊上走过时，收到了许多目光和凝视。他唯一的优势是，只有光知道剑的驾驶员身份。当他走到教室门口时，看到她不在自己的座位上，他的心碎了一点点。剑的死对她打击很大。副班长，此刻真嗣忘记了他的名字，正尽力在铃响前让全班坐好。当他用眼角瞥见真嗣时，他停了下来，转身面对他。

"_Hey, Ikari!_" He snarled.  
“嘿，碇！”他咆哮道。

The class went dead quiet and everybody's eyes went to the front. Nearly everyone fixed Shinji with a look of contempt. The deputy class rep stomped up to Shinji and got in his face. When Shinji paled and didn't say a word, he continued.  
教室里顿时鸦雀无声，所有人的目光都转向前方。几乎每个人都用一种鄙视的眼神盯着真嗣。副班长气势汹汹地走到真嗣面前，逼近他的脸。当真嗣脸色苍白，一言不发时，他继续说道。

"Decided to just waltz in here like nothing's wrong? After the way you _butchered_ Suzuhara?! What the fuck is wrong with you?!"  
"决定就这样大摇大摆地进来，好像什么都没发生过？你那样残害铃原之后？！你他妈到底怎么了？！"

A ball of cold started to grow inside of Shinji and the edges of his vision started to darken. Hikari must've spread word to the deputy rep, and if he knew, that meant only one thing.  
一股寒意在真嗣体内凝聚，视野边缘开始变暗。一定是光子告诉了副代表，如果他知道了，那就意味着一件事。

_Theyknew. **Everyone** knew what Shinji had done to Toji.  
他们知道了。所有人都知道真嗣对铃原做了什么。_

Oh no. Oh _-_ 哦不。哦——

The chiming of the bell brought Shinji back from the edge of the panic attack he was about to have, and the elderly teacher made his way in. He cleared his throat, and the deputy rep did the "stand, bow, sit" routine after fixing Shinji with a final glare that could've burned right through him. Shinji shuffled to his desk and dropped into his seat. Kensuke wouldn't even look at him. As the teacher began roll call, Shinji let his eyes wander over to where Rei Ayanami's seat was, and found her staring out the window, as always.  
铃声的响起将真嗣从即将爆发的恐慌边缘拉了回来，年迈的老师走了进来。他清了清嗓子，副班长在用一个足以将真嗣彻底穿透的最后瞪视固定住他后，进行了“起立，鞠躬，坐下”的常规动作。真嗣拖着脚步走到自己的桌前，跌坐下来。剑介甚至都不愿看他一眼。当老师开始点名时，真嗣的目光游移到了绫波零的座位上，发现她一如既往地凝视着窗外。

The rest of the day didn't go much better for Shinji. While the teacher gave his oft-repeated spiel on pre-Second Impact life, Shinji had tried to get Kensuke's attention and try to explain what had actually happened. But Kensuke merely acted as if he wasn't there, and didn't even glance at him. He just focused on whatever work was in front of him with a cold, unfeeling look on his face. Shinji just sat and stared at his desk and waited for the day to end. He didn't even leave his desk to eat lunch. He didn't even _eat_ his lunch. By the time the bell rang to go home for the day, Shinji looked near catatonic. Everyone, save Rei, fixed him with a dirty look as they all left. Even the teacher looked disapproving as Shinji finally made the effort to drag himself to his feet and leave the class.  
那天剩下的时间对真嗣来说并没有好转。当老师重复着他那关于第二次冲击前生活的老生常谈时，真嗣试图引起健介的注意，向他解释到底发生了什么。但健介只是装作没看见他，甚至没有瞥他一眼。他只是专注于面前的工作，脸上带着冷漠无情的表情。真嗣只是坐在那里，盯着桌子，等待着这一天结束。他甚至没有离开桌子去吃午饭。他连午饭都没吃。当放学铃声响起，真嗣看起来几乎呆滞了。除了绫波，所有人都带着厌恶的眼神离开。甚至连老师都带着不满的表情，看着真嗣终于费力地站起身来，离开了教室。

As Shinji exited the front gate, he spotted Rei on her way to her apartment. Shinji went after her to ask her a question.  
当真嗣走出前门时，他看到绫波正往她的公寓走去。真嗣追了上去，想问她一个问题。

"A-Ayanami..." 绫波...

No response. 没有回应。

"Ayanami." He repeated a bit louder.  
"绫波。" 他重复了一遍，声音稍大了一些。

This time, Rei stopped and turned to face Shinji with an ever-placid gaze. "Ikari. Why are you bothering me?"  
这一次，绫波停下脚步，转过身来面对真嗣，目光一如既往地平静。"碇君。你为什么要打扰我？"

Shinji froze. The flat, but blunt delivery of her words dried out his mouth in a heartbeat. This was something he never imagined he'd hear from Rei, of all people.  
真嗣愣住了。她那平淡却直截了当的话语瞬间让他口干舌燥。这是他从未想过会从绫波口中听到的话。

"I have orders not to speak with you. In the wake of your leaving NERV, the Commander has deemed it unimportant to that we remain colleagues. He has told me that 'any distractions might negatively affect my performance in battle or anything else NERV requires of me.'"  
"我有命令不得与你交谈。自从你离开 NERV 后，指挥官认为我们保持同事关系已无关紧要。他告诉我，'任何干扰都可能对我在战斗或 NERV 要求的其他事务中的表现产生负面影响。'"

Shinji had no words. '_Any distractions?_' Is that really what Rei thought of him now? By the time Shinji snapped out of it and remembered to blink again, Rei was gone. With a heavy sigh, Shinji turned back around and started his walk back to Misato's apartment.  
真嗣无言以对。'任何干扰？' 这就是丽现在对他的看法吗？当真嗣回过神来，再次眨眼时，丽已经离开了。他重重地叹了口气，转身开始走回美里小姐的公寓。

Rei's feet clicked like a metronome on the pavement as she walked back to her apartment, and she wondered why she felt a strange pang in her chest as she remembered the frozen look on Shinji's face when she left.  
丽走在回公寓的路上，脚步声如同节拍器般规律，她不明白为何想起真嗣离开时那凝固的表情，心中会感到一阵莫名的刺痛。

---

A while later, Shinji crossed the threshold into the apartment he shared with Asuka and Misato. "_Tadaima..._", he imperceptibly muttered. He slid his shoes off and made his way to his room to start on his homework. He didn't have anything more important to do.  
过了一会儿，真嗣跨进了他与明日香和美里同住的公寓门槛。“我回来了……”他几乎无声地喃喃自语。他脱下鞋子，走向自己的房间开始做作业。他没有什么更重要的事情要做。

"_Ahem!_" “咳咳！”

The sound of a throat being cleared stopped Shinji. He turned and saw Asuka standing back down the hall with her arms crossed and an unreadable look on her face. "Look who _finally_ decided to show up. Get started on dinner."  
一声清嗓子的声音让真嗣停下了脚步。他转过身，看到明日香站在走廊那头，双臂交叉，脸上带着难以捉摸的表情。“看看是谁终于决定回来了。去做晚饭吧。”

"...Asuka, I've had a really long day, and I have homework-"  
"...明日香，我今天真的很累，还有作业要写——"

"Oh, yeah? I had to go without lunch today while you spaced out for a good hour! And on top of all the dirty looks I got, what with the blackout?! I'm a _verdammt Pilot!_ Those ungrateful bastards should be _on their knees_ for what we all did! But _nooooo..._" Asuka trailed off and took a deep breath. "Get to work. Since you're not a Pilot anymore, you need to have _some_ use around here."  
"哦，是吗？我今天连午饭都没吃，而你却发呆了一个小时！再加上停电时我收到的那些白眼？！我可是个该死的驾驶员！那些不知感恩的家伙应该跪下来感谢我们所做的一切！但偏偏不……" 明日香说着说着停了下来，深吸了一口气。"去干活吧。既然你不再是驾驶员了，你得在这里有点用处。"

Shinji tried not to wince as her words reminded him of his first meeting with his father. "I-I just got home, though."  
听到她的话，真嗣试图不让自己因想起与父亲的第一次会面而退缩。"我-我刚到家，不过。"

"It's almost dinner time! Next time, maybe don't take your sweet-ass time getting back here!"  
"快到晚饭时间了！下次，别再慢吞吞地回来！"

Asuka bumped past Shinji into her room, slamming the door so hard it bounced in the rail it slid on. Shinji unfroze and checked his phone. It actually _was_ almost dinner time anyway. Had he taken _that_ long to get home after trying to talk to Rei? Shinji shook his head and dropped his bag in his room before walking back to the kitchen to start dinner.  
明日香撞开真嗣进了自己的房间，用力甩上门，门在轨道上反弹了一下。真嗣这才回过神来，看了看手机。确实快到晚饭时间了。难道他花了这么长时间才回到家，就为了和绫波说话？真嗣摇了摇头，把书包扔进自己的房间，然后走回厨房准备晚饭。

Asuka had always been a tad abrasive and loud, but she'd only gotten worse in the time since Shinji quit NERV. She threw things more often, yelled louder than before, hit harder than she used to... overall, she was becoming more and more of a detriment to Shinji's health. And he couldn't even ask for help, since Misato was either stuck at NERV underneath mountains upon mountains of paperwork, or too drunk to even notice the constant bruises Shinji was collecting.  
明日香一直有点尖锐和吵闹，但自从真嗣离开 NERV 后，她变得更糟了。她扔东西更频繁，喊得比以前更大声，打得更狠...总的来说，她对真嗣的健康越来越不利。而他甚至无法寻求帮助，因为美里要么被 NERV 堆积如山的文件困住，要么就醉得不省人事，根本注意不到真嗣身上不断增加的瘀伤。

Shinji mechanically prepared dinner. A simple miso soup was all he felt up to doing. After all, it wasn't like he'd been eating a lot lately. He'd barely noticed Misato hobbling in the front door to the fridge to get her first six-pack of the night, and his heart sank a bit lower. Asuka came out of her room for a bit to roll her eyes at the miso being prepared. Out of the corner of Shinji's eyes, he saw Asuka's glare harden before she closed in a few feet.  
真嗣机械地准备着晚餐。他只觉得能做一碗简单的味噌汤就不错了。毕竟，他最近也没怎么好好吃饭。他几乎没注意到美里一瘸一拐地从前门走进冰箱，拿走了今晚的第一打啤酒，他的心情又低落了几分。明日香从房间里出来一会儿，对着正在准备的味噌汤翻了个白眼。在真嗣的余光中，他看到明日香的目光变得更加锐利，然后她又靠近了几步。

"You know," she not-so-whispered coldly, "I need to deal with you later for the way you hurt Hikari. Can't wait for that." Asuka slinked away as Shinji's eyes widened.  
“你知道，”她冷冷地低声说道，“我晚点得跟你算账，因为你伤害了光。真等不及了。”明日香扭身离开，真嗣的眼睛瞪大了。

As Shinji slowed his breathing and heart rate down to healthier levels, he slowly craned his head to look at Misato behind him. She was four cans deep already. Shinji sullenly turned back to the stove and resumed making dinner. As they sat at the table an hour later, no one spoke a single word.  
当真嗣放缓呼吸和心率，恢复到更健康的水平时，他缓缓转头看向身后的美里。她已经喝了四罐啤酒。真嗣闷闷不乐地转回炉子前，继续做晚饭。一个小时后，他们坐在桌前，没有人说一句话。

---

That night, Shinji laid in his futon as the moonlight streaked through his window across his face. He didn't dare to close his eyes, lest he fall asleep, and have another nightmare about his last sortie in the EVA. He stared, unblinking, at the ceiling above him while the works of Chopin flowed through the earbuds of his SDAT. As the track faded to a close, Shinji suddenly hit the pause button and slowly sat up, pulling out the earbuds and setting down the SDAT next to the futon. He thought of just how badly everything had gone over the past couple of weeks between losing his friends at school and how terribly he'd been treated at home. Shinji knew that part of this was his own fault, though. He didn't _have_ to quit NERV. He could've just taken what punishment his father had planned, and gone back to doing what he ordered. But it was just hurting too much at that point. He'd finally hit his limit, and he'd run away _again._ But this time, Shinji strangely didn't have any bubbling feelings of guilt or regret in the back of his mind.  
那一夜，真嗣躺在他的被褥中，月光透过窗户洒在他脸上。他不敢闭眼，生怕入睡后再次梦见驾驶 EVA 的最后一次出击。他目不转睛地盯着天花板，耳边是肖邦的乐曲从 SDAT 的耳塞中流淌而出。随着曲目渐入尾声，真嗣突然按下暂停键，缓缓坐起身，取出耳塞，将 SDAT 放在被褥旁。他回想起过去几周发生的种种糟糕事，学校里失去朋友，家中遭受的恶劣对待。真嗣明白，这其中一部分是自己的错。他本不必离开 NERV，可以承受父亲的惩罚，继续按命令行事。但那时，痛苦已到了极限。他终于触碰到了自己的底线，又一次选择了逃离。然而这次，真嗣心中却奇怪地没有涌动着愧疚或悔恨的情绪。

He'd kept on telling himself that he mustn't run away, lest people get hurt. But every time he'd gotten into that purple monster to "save everyone", someone would _still_ end up hurt, and to Shinji, that felt like it hurt him. And then, a thought occurred. He thought that maybe, just one last time, that it was okay to run away, so that no one else would get hurt because of him. And with that, he made a grim decision that he was sure was the right one.  
他一直告诫自己绝不能逃跑，以免有人受伤。但每次他坐进那台紫色巨人里去“拯救大家”时，总有人会因此受伤，这对真嗣来说，就像是在伤害他自己。然后，一个念头闪过。他想，或许，就这一次，逃跑是可以的，这样就不会再有人因他而受伤了。带着这样的想法，他做出了一个他认为正确的决定，尽管这个决定并不轻松。

He quietly stood up out of his futon and crept to his doorway, slowly sliding his door open. As he slowly scanned the hallway and the area beyond, he noted that there was no other noise in the apartment except for his own heartbeat, the slight tinnitus in both ears that he hadn't had before piloting EVA for the first time, and the deep rumble of Misato's snoring coming from her slightly open door. He quietly crept over to her door and quietly pushed it open. He tiptoed into the room and was immediately hit with the smell of Yebisu. Shinji had to fight not to cough as the wave overtook him. And as he got closer to Misato, the smell only got stronger.  
他静静地从被窝里起身，蹑手蹑脚地走到门口，缓缓地拉开房门。他慢慢地扫视着走廊和外面的区域，注意到公寓里除了自己的心跳声、第一次驾驶 EVA 前未曾有过的轻微耳鸣，以及从微微敞开的门缝中传来的美里深沉的鼾声外，再无其他声响。他悄悄地走到她的门前，轻轻推开门。他踮着脚尖走进房间，立刻被耶比苏的气味击中。真嗣不得不强忍着不咳嗽，因为那气味如浪潮般袭来。而当他更靠近美里时，那气味愈发浓烈。

Shinji tiptoed over next to Misato, being careful not to knock any of the dozens empty cans littered on the floor, and slowly crouched down so he could find what he was looking for. He gently felt around where she'd left her uniform in a heap on the floor. This wasn't like the laundry he normally did for his two roommates. He felt so dirty going through Misato's clothes like this, but he gave himself the tiniest bit of relief by knowing that he'd only be doing this once. He just had to remember, she normally wore her holster around her-  
真嗣踮着脚走到美里身边，小心翼翼地避开地板上散落的数十个空罐，缓缓蹲下身来寻找他要找的东西。他轻轻地在美里堆成一团的制服旁摸索。这与他通常为两位室友洗的衣服不同。这样翻找美里的衣物让他感觉很肮脏，但他给自己一丝安慰，因为这只是一次性的行为。他只需记住，她通常会把枪套系在——

"_Snrk- zzz..._ Mm..." “哼哼-呼呼...嗯...”

Misato shifted under the covers next to Shinji. He stopped everything he was doing and tried not to just die right there. If she were to wake up now and find Shinji going through her clothes... Shinji didn't want to think about how that would end. He stood still for about three minutes, not even turning his head to get a better look to see if Misato was asleep or awake. After he determined that she was still sleeping, he resumed his search before his fingers landed on something solid underneath Misato's uniform. He gingerly lifted the black dress away to reveal a holster with a Heckler & Koch USP fitted into it.  
美里在真嗣旁边的被子里动了动。他立刻停下了所有动作，努力不让自己当场崩溃。如果她现在醒来，发现真嗣在翻她的衣服...真嗣不敢想象那会是什么后果。他僵立了大约三分钟，甚至没有转头去看美里是睡着还是醒着。确认她仍在熟睡后，他继续搜索，直到手指触碰到美里制服下的一件硬物。他小心翼翼地掀开黑色连衣裙，露出了一个装着赫克勒-科赫 USP 手枪的枪套。

Misato, despite the copious amounts of alcohol she now drank, had thankfully remembered basic gun safety and removed the magazine from the gun and emptied the chamber when she wasn't on duty at NERV for the day. That just meant that Shinji would have to take one of the magazines with him when he left. Shinji undid the strap that held the pistol in the holster, thanking whatever god there was that there wasn't any velcro on the strap, and slowly slid the gun out. His first thought was that the thing felt heavy in his hand. He pushed that thought aside for now and began to look for ammunition. He found a full magazine in Misato's jacket pocket, and stood up to leave. He crept his way to the door, and before he stepped out into the hall, he took one last look at Misato's face and absorbed every fine detail. There would not be a chance to do it again.  
尽管如今美里酗酒成性，但庆幸的是她还记得基本的枪支安全常识，在非 NERV 执勤日时会将弹匣卸下并清空枪膛。这意味着真嗣离开时必须随身携带一个弹匣。真嗣解开固定手枪在枪套中的带子，庆幸这条带子上没有使用魔术贴，然后缓缓将枪抽出。他首先感到的是这东西在手中沉甸甸的。他暂时抛开这个念头，开始寻找弹药。在美里的夹克口袋里，他找到了一个满载的弹匣，随即起身准备离开。他蹑手蹑脚地走向门口，在踏出房门进入走廊之前，他最后凝视了一眼美里的面庞，将每一个细微之处深深印入脑海。这恐怕是最后一次机会了。

Shinji slid out of Misato's room and gently closed the door. But before he could start to make his way back to his room, he heard a set of muted footsteps down the hall and started to panic a bit. From his best guess, Asuka had woken up and was about to walk out of her room to make her way to the bathroom. If she came out of the door at her current pace, she'd find Shinji standing in the hall holding Misato's gun, and from that point, all sorts of hell would break loose. So Shinji, thinking quickly, made his way to the bathroom, ignoring Asuka's protests, and closed and locked the door on her.  
真嗣从美里房间悄悄溜出，轻轻关上门。但还没等他开始往自己房间走，就听到走廊那头传来一阵轻微的脚步声，心里不禁有些慌乱。根据他的推测，明日香应该是醒了，正要走出房间去洗手间。如果她以现在的速度开门出来，就会看到真嗣站在走廊上，手里还拿着美里的枪，那样的话，各种麻烦事就会接踵而至。于是，真嗣迅速反应，不顾明日香的抗议，径直走向洗手间，将门关上并反锁。

As Asuka tried getting Shinji to open the door, he started to think of the best way to get out of his situation. He needed to get back to his room without Asuka seeing the gun and magazine. After a few seconds of thought, he came up with the best plan he could for the moment. He grabbed his waistband and put the gun into the front of his shorts. Enough to hide the gun, but enough to keep gravity from pulling it down to the floor, where Shinji's problems would begin. The magazine went into his pocket, and he made sure that he pushed it down enough that it wouldn't be easily visible. As he made sure the gun was _secure andhidden_, he took a deep breath and unlocked the bathroom door. He didn't need to open the door, since Asuka beat him to it.  
当明日香试图让真嗣开门时，他开始思考如何摆脱当前的困境。他需要回到自己的房间而不让明日香看到枪和弹匣。经过几秒钟的思考，他想出了当时最好的计划。他抓住腰带，将枪塞进短裤的前面，足以隐藏枪支，但又足以防止重力将其拉到地板上，那样真嗣的麻烦就会开始。弹匣则放入口袋，并确保将其压得足够深，不易被发现。确认枪支安全且隐蔽后，他深吸一口气，解锁了浴室门。他不需要开门，因为明日香已经抢先一步。

"What the hell are you doing? Haven't you ever heard of 'ladies first'?" Asuka spat, fixing him in place with her deep cobalt-blue eyes. All she wore was her usual sleeping attire, an oversized yellow t-shirt and her underwear. Drops of sweat started to run down Shinji's neck.  
“你到底在干什么？难道没听说过‘女士优先’吗？”明日香厉声说道，用她深邃的钴蓝色眼睛盯着他。她只穿着平常的睡衣，一件 oversized 的黄色 T 恤和内裤。汗水开始顺着真嗣的脖子流下。

"Uhh... s-sorry." Shinji replied nervously.  
“呃... 对-对不起。”真嗣紧张地回答道。

"Oh _meinGott_, _again_ with the 'sorry'?! And what the hell were you doing standing outside of Misato's room, huh? Trying to sneak a peek on her sleeping in her underwear?" Asuka said, not exactly trying to be quiet.  
“哦，我的天，又是‘对不起’？！你到底在 Misato 房间外面干什么？想偷看她穿着内衣睡觉吗？”Asuka 说道，并没有刻意压低声音。

"What, no! I-" Shinji stammered, trying to come up with any reasonable excuse of get out of this situation intact. Asuka cut him off, however.  
“什么，不！我——”Shinji 结结巴巴地试图找到任何合理的借口来摆脱这个局面。然而，Asuka 打断了他。

"Honestly, there's people here still making themselves _useful_ that need-"  
“老实说，这里还有人需要做些有用的事情——”

Asuka cut off her rant as she noticed something below Shinji's face. Her eyes widened and her voice became even more dangerous as the volume dropped. "_...What... the hell... is that?_"  
明日香打断了她的抱怨，因为她注意到真嗣脸下方的某个东西。她的眼睛睁大了，声音变得更加危险，音量也降低了。"...这...到底...是什么？"

"Wha-?" Shinji didn't know how respond or what she was talking about until he looked down to where Asuka's eyes fell, and every drop of blood left his face. In the front of his shorts, the very vague outline of Misato's gun could be seen noticeably poking out about an inch from his thigh. Thankfully for him, the loose-fitting shorts he wore concealed the true nature of the cause of the bulge, but unfortunately gave the appearance of a very male-specific problem. Shinji began sweating even harder and his fluent grasp of his own native language seemed to disappear as he tried to get himself out of this predicament.  
"什-？" 真嗣不知道该如何回应，也不知道明日香在说什么，直到他顺着她的目光看向自己的下方，顿时面无血色。在他的短裤前部，可以明显看到美里手枪的模糊轮廓，从他的大腿处凸出了一英寸。幸运的是，他穿的宽松短裤掩盖了凸起的真正原因，但不幸的是，这给人一种非常男性特有的问题的错觉。真嗣开始更加紧张地出汗，他对自己母语的流利掌握似乎消失了，因为他试图摆脱这个困境。

"_Oh my fucking God._ You- you're- Is that-?!"  
"哦，我的天哪。你-你这是-是那-？!"

Thankfully, Asuka seemed to be at a loss for words as well, which only gave Shinji a few more seconds to stammer and trip over his words. "N-No! It's not like... I mean-"  
幸好，明日香似乎也一时语塞，这让真嗣又多了几秒钟结结巴巴、语无伦次。“不、不是的！我不是那个意思……我是说——”

"_Shut up._" “闭嘴。”

"...Huh?" Shinji was deeply afraid of what was going to happen next. The coldness returned to Asuka's tone as she found her voice again in an instant. The volume of her voice dropped to a whisper.  
“……啊？”真嗣深感接下来会发生什么可怕的事。明日香的语气瞬间恢复了冰冷，她的声音低沉到几乎成了耳语。

"I said, _shut the fuck up_. I don't want to hear whatever pathetic excuse you've got. You're _disgusting._"  
"我说了，闭上你的臭嘴。我不想听你那可怜的借口。你真令人恶心。"

Disgusting. The sheer venom that Asuka spat with that one word completely froze Shinji in place, and for the next few seconds, left him totally numb. He barely felt Asuka shoving him to the side to enter the bathroom. He barely heard the door being slammed shut behind him. He didn't even remember sliding down the wall and coming to rest on the floor. After a few minutes that felt like hours, Shinji dragged himself up to his feet and began to slowly trudge back to his room. He tried not to pay attention to the angry mumbling in German coming from the other side of the bathroom door. He couldn't understand a word of the language, but he just knew that nothing that was coming out of Asuka's mouth was good. As he slowly slid his door shut, he heard the bathroom door being roughly pushed open and Asuka stomping back to her own room, shutting her own door a bit harder than necessary.  
令人恶心。明日香用这个词所喷涌出的纯粹恶意完全让真嗣僵在原地，接下来的几秒钟里，他完全麻木了。他几乎感觉不到明日香将他推到一边进入浴室。他几乎听不到身后的门被猛地关上。他甚至不记得自己是怎么滑下墙壁，最后坐在地板上的。几分钟过去了，仿佛过了几个小时，真嗣挣扎着站起身，开始慢慢拖着脚步回到自己的房间。他尽量不去注意浴室门另一边传来的愤怒的德语低语。他一个字也听不懂这种语言，但他就是知道，明日香嘴里吐出的没有一句好话。当他慢慢关上自己的房门时，他听到浴室的门被粗暴地推开，明日香气冲冲地回到她自己的房间，用力地关上了自己的门，比必要的力度还要大一些。

Shinji sat himself down on his futon and laid against the wall under the window. He reached into his waistband and withdrew Misato's gun to examine it under the moonlight. He'd never held a gun before, and he was partly glad that he wouldn't have to again after tonight. It was scary, holding it in front of him, knowing just how much damage that this could cause in the wrong hands.  
真嗣坐在自己的蒲团上，背靠着窗户下的墙壁。他伸手从腰带里取出美里小姐的枪，借着月光仔细端详。他从未握过枪，今晚之后，他有些庆幸自己不必再握枪了。拿着它，面对着自己，知道这东西落在坏人手里会造成多大的破坏，这让他感到害怕。

Shinji quickly brushed that last thought about 'the wrong hands' aside and set about wondering how this would be done. He aimed the empty gun across the room at the door, and tried to pull the trigger. After the trigger didn't move and the silence reigned for a bit in his room, Shinji gave the gun a quick once over to see if anything else could be pressed or pulled. He found a small lever at the back of the slide, acting as the gun's safety. After pushing this lever down and seeing a red dot slide into view, he found that the trigger could now move freely if he squeezed it.  
真嗣迅速抛开了关于'坏人'的念头，开始思考如何操作。他将空枪对准房间另一头的门，试图扣动扳机。扳机没有动，房间里一片寂静。真嗣迅速检查了一下枪，看看是否有其他按钮或拉杆可以操作。他在滑套后部发现了一个小杠杆，作为枪的安全装置。按下这个杠杆，看到一个红点滑入视线后，他发现现在只要用力挤压，扳机就可以自由移动了。

Going from memory of watching NERV employees at the on-base firing range when he'd had nothing better to do after sync tests, he removed the magazine from his pocket and inserted it into the bottom of the gun's grip, pushing it into place with a solid *CLICK*. Shinji also remembered that most of the pistols he'd seen the NERV employees use had a sliding part on top. If he had to guess, that was how the bullets were moved into place to be shot. He grabbed the top of the gun and began to pull back until it stopped. Once that was done, he noticed that he could see down through a hole in the slide and see a lone bullet sitting on top, ready to be moved into position. However, he found that the slide had locked itself backwards. Shinji examined the gun further to try and move it back into position, and in doing so, he hit... something, and the slide shot forward into its resting position with a loud *SCHLACK!* noise. Shinji tried not to scream, since anyone who was still awake definitely would have heard that.  
回想起在同步测试后无所事事时，曾在基地射击场看到 NERV 员工们的情景，他从口袋里取出弹匣，插入枪柄底部，用力一推，伴随着一声清脆的*咔嚓*声，弹匣就位。真嗣还记得，大多数 NERV 员工使用的 pistols 顶部都有一个滑动部件。他猜测，这应该是用来将子弹推进射击位置的机制。他握住枪的顶部，开始向后拉动，直到它停下。完成这一步后，他注意到可以通过滑套上的一个小孔向下看，看到一枚孤零零的子弹正躺在那里，准备进入射击位置。然而，他发现滑套已经向后锁住了。真嗣进一步检查枪支，试图将其复位，就在这时，他触碰到了某个机关，滑套猛地向前弹回原位，发出一声响亮的*啪嗒*声。真嗣尽量不让自己尖叫出来，因为任何还没睡的人肯定都听到了这一声响。

After not moving or breathing for what felt like an hour, Shinji looked at the now-loaded-and-ready-to-fire weapon in his hand. And everything Shinji had just done, and what he was about to do finally seemed to hit him. His breathing began to slowly speed up as he started to worry, 'What if this doesn't go right?' 'What happens if I survive this?' 'What would Misato and Asuka say if they saw this?' The only answer he could come up with was for the last point. He imagined Misato being so drunk off her ass to not even notice, and Asuka smiling evilly at him and quietly whispering words of encouragement, daring him to do it. He thought of Toji, laying helplessly in the hospital bed, missing limbs and dependent on machines to keep him functioning, and Hikari, screaming her heart out with tears running unencumbered from her eyes. He thought again of Toji's sister, Sakura, and how he'd crippled her in his very first outing in Unit-01. He imagined the countless civilians of Tokyo-3 that got themselves stuck in the crossfire of the Angel battles that were ultimately maimed, crippled or killed due to his actions in the EVA. '_This is the right thing to do,_' he thought. '_This way, no one else gets hurt._'  
在仿佛静止了一个小时的静止与屏息之后，真嗣看着手中已装填完毕、随时可以发射的武器。他刚刚所做的一切，以及即将要做的事情，终于如重锤般击中了他。他的呼吸开始慢慢加快，担忧也随之而来：“万一这行不通怎么办？”“如果我活下来会怎样？”“美里和明日香看到这一幕会说什么？”他唯一能想到的答案是关于最后一个问题。他想象着美里醉得不省人事，根本不会注意到，而明日香则邪恶地笑着，轻声细语地鼓励他，挑衅他去做。他想到了躺在医院病床上无助的冬二，失去四肢，依赖机器维持生命，还有泪流满面、心碎尖叫的光。他又想起了冬二的妹妹樱，以及他在初号机中的首次出击是如何让她致残的。他想象着无数被卷入使徒战斗、最终因他在 EVA 中的行动而致残、瘫痪或丧生的第三新东京市民。“这是正确的选择，”他心想。 “这样，就不会再有人受伤了。”'

Shinji was suddenly painfully aware of how quiet it was in his room. Desperately wanting something to fill the quiet air, he slowly reached over to the side of his futon and picked up his SDAT player. One last song. He pressed the earbuds into place, hit the play button, and gently set the player down next to him. The rich, deep notes of Bach's _Cello Suite 1_ filled Shinji's ears, and brought tears to his eyes. The song only served to make Shinji remember one of his most painful memories since he arrived in Tokyo-3. Not the endless lingering physical and psychological phantom pains of piloting the EVA, not the dull throbbing in his cheek from the time Toji punched him across the face after finding out he was Unit-01's pilot, not the cruel indifference of his father as he made Shinji rip Unit-03 to shreds. The one memory that the mournful notes of the cello brought to light was _that night_ sometime before the three pilots fought Leliel, when Misato went to that wedding and left him and Asuka alone in the apartment. When she'd actually _applauded_ him when she heard him practicing this very song on his cello. When she'd... _kissed_ him,_actually kissed him_, and promptly swore to never kiss anyone to kill time again. And now, with how carelessly she'd treated him... This was the memory that hurt the most. Nothing else compared. Shinji tried to keep himself from crying out from how much the memory hurt him. It was one of the hardest things he'd ever done, but he kept himself quiet as the notes and the tears and the hurt washed over him in waves.  
真嗣突然痛苦地意识到自己的房间是多么安静。他迫切想要填补这寂静的空气，慢慢地伸手到被褥旁边，拿起了他的 SDAT 播放器。最后一首歌。他将耳塞塞好，按下播放键，轻轻地把播放器放在身边。巴赫的大提琴组曲 1 那丰富深沉的音符充满了真嗣的耳朵，让他不禁泪流满面。这首曲子只是让真嗣回忆起他来到东京-3 后最痛苦的记忆之一。不是驾驶 EVA 带来的无尽的身心幻痛，不是被东治发现他是零一机驾驶员后打在脸上的那一拳引起的隐隐作痛，也不是父亲对他残忍的冷漠，让他撕碎零三机的那一刻。大提琴哀伤的旋律唤起的记忆是，在三位驾驶员与雷利尔战斗之前的那晚，美里去参加婚礼，留下他和明日香独自在公寓里。那时她听到他练习这首曲子时，竟然为他鼓掌。那时她…… 她真的吻了他，实实在在地吻了他，并发誓再也不为了打发时间而吻任何人。而现在，她对他的轻率态度……这是最令他心痛的记忆。其他一切都无法与之相比。真嗣努力克制自己不因这份记忆的痛苦而哭喊出来。这是他做过的最艰难的事情之一，但他保持沉默，任由音符、泪水和痛苦如潮水般涌来。

As the final measures of the piece drifted through his earbuds, Shinji began to bring the muzzle of the gun closer to his head. He brought it to rest just underneath his chin and curled his finger around the trigger. He tried his best to stop his hands from shaking, lest that throw off the bullet's path. He was a bit sad that he wouldn't have a chance to make things right to anyone, to try and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he didn't have a choice in what his father had made him do, but at least this way, he wouldn't hurt anyone else, and he wouldn't be hurt anymore.  
随着乐曲的最后一拍通过耳塞传入耳中，真嗣开始将枪口慢慢靠近自己的头部。他将枪口抵在下巴下方，手指环绕在扳机上。他尽力阻止双手颤抖，以免影响子弹的路径。他有些遗憾无法向任何人证明自己别无选择，无法尝试证明他父亲逼他做的事情并非出于他的意愿，但至少这样，他不会再伤害任何人，也不会再受到伤害。

And that managed to put a small, albeit sad, smile on his face as his hands stopped shaking.  
这让他脸上勉强露出一丝苦笑，尽管悲伤，但他的手终于停止了颤抖。

The notes of Bach faded into silence, and the SDAT stopped.  
巴赫的乐曲声渐渐消逝于寂静，SDAT 也随之停止了播放。

Shinji Ikari only had time to hear a sharp *CLICK* as he pulled the trigger down all the way.  
碇真嗣只来得及听到一声尖锐的*咔嚓*声，当他完全扣下扳机时。

The roaring of the gun going off tore through the entire apartment and roughly ripped all the residents from their sleep. Misato bolted upright in her futon with a piercing scream. Even though she'd been dead asleep with an unhealthy amount of beer in her system a moment before, she'd still recognize the sound of a gunshot anywhere. Her mind went into overdrive as she quickly went for her holster to use her gun to defend herself and the kids from whatever intruder was in their home. However, upon finding her holster empty and the spare magazine missing from her jacket, a cold wave ran through her that had her sobered up in no time.  
枪声轰鸣，撕裂了整个公寓的宁静，粗暴地将所有居民从睡梦中惊醒。美里从她的被褥中猛然坐起，发出刺耳的尖叫。尽管前一刻她还因大量啤酒而沉沉入睡，但她仍能立刻辨认出枪声。她的思维飞速运转，迅速伸手去拿枪套，准备用枪自卫并保护孩子们免受任何闯入者的威胁。然而，当她发现枪套空空如也，备用弹匣也从外套中消失时，一股寒意袭来，让她瞬间清醒。

She clawed herself to her feet and threw her door open. She quickly found that Asuka had done the exact same thing down the hallway from her. The two of them shared a look that seemed to scream '_What in the **hell** was that?!'_ They both combed the apartment looking for whatever could have caused the noise before they realized that Shinji hadn't even left his room at all to investigate. Or even made any noise... as the shot woke the girls up. Their eyes widened as much as possible before hurrying and tripping over themselves to get to Shinji's room, praying that the conclusion they came to was wrong.  
她挣扎着站起身，猛地推开自己的房门。她很快发现，阿斯卡也在走廊的另一头做了同样的事情。两人对视一眼，仿佛在尖叫：‘这到底是什么鬼？！’她们在公寓里四处搜寻，试图找出可能制造出那声响的源头，直到意识到真嗣根本就没离开过自己的房间去调查。甚至没有发出任何声响……那声巨响唤醒了女孩们。她们的眼睛瞪得不能再大，急忙跌跌撞撞地冲向真嗣的房间，祈祷她们得出的结论是错误的。

Asuka was the one to throw his door open. Misato was right behind her.  
阿斯卡猛地推开了他的房门。美里紧随其后。

In his depressed state of mind, Shinji managed to overlook the hugely obvious fact that his short-sighted actions on this night would indeed deeply hurt the people he once considered very close to him. But unfortunately, what was done was done, and Shinji felt no more.  
在抑郁的心境中，真嗣未能注意到一个极为明显的事实：他在这个夜晚的短视行为确实会深深伤害那些他曾经视为非常亲近的人。但遗憾的是，事情已经发生，真嗣已无所感。

Across Tokyo-3, Rei Ayanami woke up with a scream, covered in sweat and panting. Her immediate thoughts were that this should not be a possibility, due to the heavy medications ordered by the Commander. However, as she slowly caught her breath, she took note of several facts: One, the current time was 0248, hours away from when she should have been waking up. Two, she had... tears running down her face? How? Why? She had never cried before. And three, she had a feeling of sickening dread settling in her stomach, as if she knew that something absolutely terrible had just happened.  
在东京-3 的各处，绫波零尖叫着醒来，浑身冷汗，喘息不止。她立刻想到这本不该发生，因为司令下达了重药的命令。然而，当她慢慢平复呼吸时，她注意到了几个事实：一，当前时间是 0248，距离她应该醒来的时间还有几个小时。二，她的脸上...有泪水滑落？怎么会？为什么？她从未哭过。三，她的胃里有一种令人作呕的恐惧感，仿佛她知道刚刚发生了绝对可怕的事情。

Before she could give any thought to that, the air was suddenly filled with an extremely loud and grating klaxon that was unfortunately very familiar to anyone who lived in Tokyo-3. The feeling of dread only grew worse, and all Rei could do was sit there, letting the tears roll down her flat, emotionless face as Section 2 desperately started pounding on her door to bring her to NERV to deal with the latest Angel threat.  
在她来得及思考之前，空气中突然充满了极其响亮且刺耳的警报声，这对于居住在东京-3 的任何人来说都是再熟悉不过的。恐惧感愈发强烈，绫波只能坐在那里，任由泪水顺着她那平坦、无表情的脸颊滑落，而第二支部则拼命敲打着她的门，急切地要将她带到 NERV 去应对最新的使徒威胁。

**THE END 完**

### Comment
[skyf0x](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/14765557/skyf0x): I can understand that watching Evangelion can bring painful feelings, sadness and depression. But the show did it to accentuate the route that leads to catharsis in the end, filled with the relief and hope. So I'm not very happy with the need to delve into more horrific and hopeless alternatives of some big events without any conclusion.  
我理解观看《新世纪福音战士》可能会带来痛苦、悲伤和抑郁的情绪。但这部剧这样做是为了强调最终导致宣泄的道路，充满了解脱和希望。因此，我对需要深入探讨一些重大事件的更可怕和绝望的替代方案而没有任何结论感到不太满意。

I like this possibility of Shinji staying in Tokyo-3 after leaving NERV. It actually shows that he has nowhere to go. The way of characterization of Hikari was one of the most interesting parts, since we didn't really see how Bardiel aftermath could change her feelings about Shinji. I'd say her behaviour looks pretty understandable.  
我喜欢这种可能性，即真嗣留在第三新东京市后离开NERV。这实际上表明他无处可去。光的角色塑造是其中最有趣的部分之一，因为我们并没有真正看到巴迪尔事件后她的感受会如何改变对真嗣的看法。我认为她的行为看起来相当合理。

What I didn't understand is behaviour of Asuka. It was really poorly created characterization in the worst way possible. It's like if we take the most superficial description of the character without watching the show. 'She is a rude bitch' - it's not how it works and it definitely doesn't work here. Her motives are not understandable, it's like she was placed at some points in the story out of nowhere, making her clueless about what is happening around. But she knew what happened and she was holding some grudge and anger towards Shinji because of Hikari's pain? That was really strange, I think all of it was done just to increase the level of angst and hopeless, but it's not believable. Though I really liked the scene at the bathroom, it was pretty original and cool.  
我不理解的是明日香的行为。这是最糟糕的角色塑造方式。就好像我们只看了对角色最肤浅的描述，而没有真正观看剧集。“她是个粗鲁的婊子”——这不是角色塑造的方式，而且在这里绝对行不通。她的动机不明确，就好像她在故事中的某些点突然出现，对周围发生的事情一无所知。但她知道发生了什么，她对真嗣怀有怨恨和愤怒，因为光受到了伤害？这真的很奇怪，我认为这一切都是为了增加痛苦和绝望的程度，但这并不令人信服。尽管我真的很喜欢浴室里的场景，它非常原创和酷。

Bearing in mind all of the above I don't have any clue what this story is trying to say. It was endless and grotesque angst just for Shinji to do a final move. Some parts are believable, but the most other parts are not. It was a great way to explore a psyche of character, very good and vivid descriptions of the way of thinking. I really liked the style and narration, it's really cool, especially if it's your first fic. I'm just feeling bad that your skill was used to create something like this, so I hope you will write more stories in the future.
考虑到以上所有因素，我不明白这个故事想要表达什么。它无休止且怪诞的痛苦只是为了让真嗣做出最后的举动。有些部分是可信的，但大多数部分不是。这是一个探索角色心理的好方法，非常好的、生动的思维方式描述。我真的很喜欢这种风格和叙述，真的很酷，尤其是如果你是第一次写同人小说。我只是觉得你的技能被用来创造这样的作品很遗憾，所以我希望你将来能写出更多故事。

[SpecH82T](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1054767/SpecH82T): Well. At least at the end he finally grew a spine, made a decision and followed through with said choise.  A chapter two would be intressting. See the fallout his decision lead to.
至少在最后，他终于鼓起勇气，做出了决定，并坚持了自己的选择。再写一章将会很有趣，看看他的决定导致了什么后果。

**Prefer not to sa**: To be honest, I actually reread your story multiple times and I think it's overly crushing. Every detail was crafted to make it seem sad. I don't think the news wouldn't know they aren't kids, since Shinji is already well known at his school. And Asukas overly bitchy too. Why would she want revenge for something he didn't do?
老实说，我其实多次重读了你的故事，我觉得它过于压抑了。每一个细节都被精心设计来营造悲伤的氛围。我不认为新闻会不知道他们不是孩子，因为真嗣在学校已经很有名了。而且明日香也过于刻薄了。为什么她会因为一件他没做过的事情而想要复仇呢？

[Petrus streamrock](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8093814/Petrus-streamrock): DUDE BRO! The way you capture the emotion in your writing is amazing! I could feel the pain Shinji is feeling from how well you write each scene.  
兄弟！你捕捉情感的写作方式真是太棒了！我能感受到真嗣的痛苦，因为你把每个场景都写得那么好。

Please! Write another chapter! At least show a little bit of the aftermath of Shinji's death. How is it affecting all the characters around Him! Like Asuka, Rei, Misato, Gendo, and etc. At least write that in chapter 2 and this fict will be completed.  
请！写另一个章节！至少展示一下真嗣死后的一些后果。这对他周围的所有角色有什么影响！比如明日香、丽、美里、源堂等等。至少在第二章写这些，这个同人小说就完整了。

For now, this fict gonna find a snug place in my Favourite.
现在，这个同人小说将在我的收藏中找到一个舒适的位置。
