**A/N:** I made a few artistic changes and tried to give this storie some volume. I hope you like the revision.  
A/N: 我对故事进行了一些艺术性的改动，并尝试为其增添了些许厚度。希望你会喜欢这次修订。

### Chapter 1

Shinji was greatly surprised when the car came to a stop in front of the large red brick building. He had enjoyed the ride there. It had provided him with the rare opportunity of not thinking about anything. As the wind flew past the windshield of the red convertible and gently ruffled his hair, his mind was blank. He watched the painted lines on the highway as they disappeared beneath the car. In the back of his mind, he realized that had the car not been occupying two lanes this wouldn't have occurred. But in his presents state of consciousness all he could do was wonder what happened to the lines when they left his sight.  
当车子停在一座宏伟的红砖建筑前时，真嗣大吃一惊。他享受着这段旅程，难得有机会不去思考任何事情。随着风从红色敞篷车的挡风玻璃旁掠过，轻柔地拂动他的头发，他的思绪一片空白。他注视着高速公路上的漆线在车下消失。在心底某个角落，他意识到如果车子没有占据两条车道，这一切就不会发生。但在他当前的意识状态下，他只能好奇那些线条在他视线之外去了哪里。

In short, Shinji was completely out of it. He did not notice when the car traveled onto the exit ramp, taking the turn at a dangerous speed. He didn't even bat an eye when the car slowed to a reasonable speed that only exceeded the speed limit by 15 miles per hour. But somewhere along the line they had arrived at their destination and Misato's words snapped him out of his reprieve.  
简而言之，真嗣完全沉浸在自己的世界里。他没有注意到车子何时驶上了出口匝道，以危险的速度转弯。即使车速减至仅比限速快 15 英里每小时，他也未曾眨眼。但不知何时，他们已经到达了目的地，美里的话语将他从这种恍惚状态中唤醒。

"We're here," she said softly as if not to raise the dead.  
"我们到了，"她轻声说道，仿佛怕惊扰了亡灵。

"Oh," was all he could mange to say as she turned to face him in the passenger seat. Shinji himself straitened up in his seat, but did not raise his head to meet her gaze. He wasn't avoiding her. He was just avoiding her eyes. It was better for both of them that way.  
"哦，"他只能勉强挤出这么一个字，当她转身面对他时，坐在副驾驶座上。真嗣自己挺直了身子，但没有抬起头与她对视。他并非在回避她，只是回避她的目光。这样对双方都好。

Misato sighed. It seemed like she sighed a lot these days. It was strange to see her not in a state of artificial alcohol-induced cheer, despite the fact that she'd been sober for a month now. Shinji silently wondered if sighing was a symptom of withdrawal.  
美里叹了口气。最近她似乎经常叹气。奇怪的是，尽管她已经戒酒一个月了，却不再是一副酒精催生的假欢快状态。真嗣默默地想，叹气会不会是戒断症状之一。

"You know," said Misato, "You don't have to do this."  
"你知道吗，" 美里说，"你不必这么做。"

"I know," he said with his eyes on his feet. For the life of him he couldn't remember where he'd gotten that grass stain on his sneakers. It was an interesting question. At least interesting enough to distract him from the conversation.  
"我知道，" 他目光低垂，盯着脚下的地面。他怎么也想不起来那块草渍是怎么沾到运动鞋上的。这个问题挺有意思的，至少足以让他从对话中分心。

"Are you sure you want to go?"  
"你确定你要去吗？"

"Yeah. I'm sure," he said. His response was too fast for Misato's liking.  
“嗯，我确定。”他回答得太快，让美里不太满意。

"You cried for hours last time Shinji."  
“上次真嗣你哭了几个小时呢。”

He briefly looked up at her, but quickly looked back down.  
他短暂地抬头看了她一眼，随即又迅速低下头去。

"Is that wrong?" he asked. Misato was slightly taken aback.  
"那样不对吗？" 他问道。美里稍稍有些惊讶。

"No… of course it's not. It's just hard to see you like that."  
"不……当然不是。只是看到你这样，心里有些难受。"

"I'm sorry." "对不起。"

"Don't be." "别这样。"

Misato wiped a stray strand of hair out of her face. It was clouding her vision. She needed to concentrate. He wouldn't like what she had to say.  
美里抹去脸上的一缕散乱发丝，它遮挡了她的视线。她需要集中精神。他不会喜欢她要说的话。

"Maybe it's best if you didn't."  
“也许你最好还是别说了。”

"Didn't what?" he asked with confusion clearly etched upon his face.  
“别说什么？”他困惑地问道，脸上的表情清晰可见。

"Didn't see her." "没看到她。"

Shinji frowned. 真嗣皱了皱眉。

"I have to see her. She needs me."  
"我必须见到她。她需要我。"

"She wouldn't want you to be unhappy because of her."  
"她不会希望你因为她而不快乐的。"

"She wants to see me. She misses me."  
"她想见我。她想念我。"

"How could you possibly know that?"  
"你怎么可能知道这些？"

"I don't know." His hand was itching to grab the handle of the car door.  
"我不知道。" 他的手痒得想要抓住车门把手。

Misato sighed. 美里叹了口气。

"You remember what happened last time?" she asked. "The Nurses had to drag you out of there."  
"你还记得上次发生了什么吗？" 她问道。"护士们不得不把你从那里拖出来。"

Shinji's face darkened. He remembered what happened. He remembered it quite well.  
真嗣的脸色阴沉下来。他记得发生的事情。他记得非常清楚。

"It was Nine-Fifty-Five."  
"现在是九点五十五分。"

"So?"

"Visiting hours are over at Ten."  
"探视时间在十点结束。"

Misato sighed. This was turning out to be harder than she anticipated.  
美里叹了口气。事情比她预想的要难得多。

"I know that you care about her, but this is not healthy."  
"我知道你在乎她，但这并不健康。"

"She's getting better." "她正在好转。"

"Did the doctor's say that?"  
"医生们这么说的吗？"

"No," he admitted. "But I can tell. Last time she called me by my name and spoke to me the whole time."  
"不，"他承认道，"但我能感觉到。上次她叫了我的名字，全程都在和我说话。"

Misato sighed. 美里叹了口气。

Shinji's hand was on the handle.  
真嗣的手放在了门把手上。

"I can see you aren't going to change your mind. I won't hold you any longer."  
"我看得出你不会改变主意了。我不会再留你了。"

"Thank you Misato," he said with a slight nod of his head. He finally opened the door and stepped out of the car. He couldn't help but notice the excessive length of the sidewalk leading up to the building. He wondered if it was to keep normal people away. Away from the place where they held her, where they held Asuka.  
"谢谢你，美里。" 他微微点头致意，终于推开车门走了出去。他不禁注意到通往大楼的人行道异常漫长，心想这或许是用来隔绝普通人靠近的吧。远离那个关押她的地方，关押明日香的地方。

As Misato watched him walk off, she couldn't stop herself from whispering three words: "Don't get hurt."  
美里目送他离去，忍不住低声呢喃了三个字："别受伤了。"

"Hello Mr. Ikari," said a warm faced woman sitting behind the visitors' desk. She was smiling softly at Shinji, but he could tell she was a little nervous. His last visit had not ended well. The only things he remembered from the encounter was taking a swing at an orderly and Asuka smiling and waving as she said goodbye. After the incident he was taken to see the head administrative doctor of the institution. The doctor was a kindly old man who seemed very sympathetic to Shinji's plight. He was let off without any consequences, but that didn't mean the staff had forgotten what happened.  
"你好，碇先生。" 坐在访客台后的一位面容和蔼的女士微笑着向真嗣打招呼，尽管她的笑容中带着一丝紧张。上次来访的结局并不愉快，真嗣只记得自己曾向一名医护人员挥拳，而明日香则微笑着挥手告别。那次事件后，他被带到机构的首席行政医生那里。那位医生是个慈祥的老人，对真嗣的处境深表同情。他并未受到任何惩罚，但这并不意味着工作人员忘记了发生的一切。

"Hello ma'am," Shinji said quietly keeping his head down.  
“您好，女士，”真嗣轻声说道，低着头。

"Are you here to see Miss Soryu again?"  
“您是来看望丽小姐的吗？”

"Yes, ma'am," said Shinji looking at the floor. It was hard to look anyone in the eye knowing what he'd done. It was even harder because he knew that given the chance he'd do it again. Without hesitation.  
“是的，女士，”真嗣看着地板回答。知道自己所做之事，很难直视任何人。更难的是，他知道如果再有机会，他会毫不犹豫地重蹈覆辙。

"I need you to sign this sheet and then you're free to see her."  
"我需要你在这张纸上签字，然后你就可以去见她了。"

"Ok," said Shinji as he picked up the pen. He wrote down the time and signed his name. He stared curiously at what he had just written. For the second he was lost in thought. The nurse took notice of his hesitation.  
"好的，" 真嗣说着拿起笔，写下时间和自己的名字。他好奇地盯着刚刚写下的字迹，有那么一瞬陷入了沉思。护士注意到了他的迟疑。

"You do know where it is, right?" she asked sounding more concerned than Shinji would have liked. He admired her kindness despite the uneasiness she obviously felt.  
"你知道地方的，对吧？" 她问道，语气比真嗣希望的更加关切。尽管她明显感到不安，他还是欣赏她的善意。

"Six doors down the hall to the left?"  
"左边走廊过去第六扇门？"

"Yep, that's it," said the nurse. Then as Shinji turned to leave she said, "I hope it goes well for you this time."  
"没错，就是那间。"" 护士说道。随后，当真嗣转身离开时，她补充道，""希望这次对你来说一切顺利。"

Shinji stopped walking, but continued to stare at the floor. After a moment he continued on his way, but not before mumbling out a soft, "Thank you Ma'am."  
真嗣停下脚步，但依旧盯着地板。片刻后，他继续前行，临走前低声咕哝了一句，""谢谢您，女士。"

While walking through the empty halls of the mental hospital, he couldn't help but notice how clean and organized everything was. It was a reflection of how his dream home would be: neat and tidy. He couldn't suppress the feeling that he would fit in well here. A shudder ran up his spine. It wasn't the first time that he had thought he might belong in such a place. He was slightly disturbed by the loud manner in which his footsteps echoed through the hall and it was no small relief when he found himself outside of Asuka's door. He quickly opened the door and stepped inside.  
当他穿过精神病院空荡荡的走廊时，不禁注意到一切是多么干净和井然有序。这反映了他梦想中的家应有的样子：整洁有序。他无法抑制自己觉得在这里会很适应的感觉。一阵寒颤沿着他的脊背升起。这不是他第一次觉得自己可能属于这样的地方。他略感不安地听着自己脚步声在走廊中回响，当他发现自己站在明日香门前时，不禁松了一口气。他迅速打开门，走了进去。

Asuka's room was simplistic in its design. There was a small twin-sized bed in the corner of the room and a wooden dresser for her keep her clothes in. The walls were bare. The doctors had wanted to keep things as scarce as possible for fear that she might hurt herself. They realized that a girl with her education could still manage to do so, but figured it'd be best not to make it easy for her.  
明日香的房间设计简洁。房间一角放着一张小号单人床，还有一个木制梳妆台用来存放她的衣物。墙壁空无一物。医生们希望尽可能减少物品，担心她可能会伤害自己。他们意识到，像她这样受过教育的女孩仍然有可能这么做，但认为最好不要让她轻易得手。

But these things were not on Shinji's mind as he entered the room. His attention was divided between two individuals: Asuka and the girl who held Asuka in her lap. The girl was no older than 15, yet she was burdened with the responsibility of taking care of Asuka. It was a hard task for a girl of her age and Shinji admired her for it. He admired everything about the girl and was saddened that she had to live in such a place as this.  
但这些念头并未占据真嗣的思绪，当他踏入房间时，他的注意力被两个人所吸引：明日香和那位将明日香抱在膝上的女孩。那女孩不过 15 岁左右，却肩负起照顾明日香的重任。对于她这个年纪来说，这是一项艰巨的任务，真嗣对此深感敬佩。他对那女孩的一切都充满敬意，也为她不得不生活在这样的环境中而感到难过。

"Nice to see you again, Shinji," said the girl in a cheerful tone. "Asuka has missed you a lot."  
“很高兴再次见到你，真嗣，”女孩用欢快的语气说道，“明日香很想你呢。”

"I missed her too," said Shinji. "It's also good to see you."  
“我也想她了，”真嗣回应道，“见到你也很高兴。”

"Have a seat," said the girl patting a spot next to her on the bed. "Asuka would have offered you one, but she's been so rude these days, haven't you?"  
"请坐吧，"女孩拍了拍床边她旁边的位置说道，"如果是明日香，她会给你让个座，但她最近太没礼貌了，不是吗？"

Asuka, however, did not seem to have an opinion on the matter. She sat quietly in the girl's lap and smiled brightly at the wall.  
然而，明日香对此似乎并无意见。她静静地坐在女孩的腿上，对着墙壁灿烂地微笑。

"She's not rude at all," said Shinji shifting uncomfortably on the bed. He wished that it had been pushed up to the wall so that he'd have something to lean his back against. Leaning always made him feel more stable.  
"她一点儿也不粗鲁，"真嗣在床上不安地挪动着，他希望床能靠墙，这样他就可以有个东西靠着背。靠着东西总让他感觉更踏实些。

"Oh you're just being polite, she's being very rude. Always has been."  
"哦，你只是客气罢了，她一直很粗鲁。从来都是这样。"

"I never minded." "我从不介意。"

"That's very nice of you to say," said the girl. "Asuka you should thank Shinji for being so kind."  
"你这么说真是太好了，"女孩说道。"明日香，你应该感谢真嗣这么善良。"

"It's ok. You're embarrassing me." He didn't bother to hide his blush. The girl would have known anyways. She'd always been too smart for him.  
"没事的。你让我有点尴尬。" 他没费心去掩饰自己的脸红。反正那女孩总会知道的。她总是比他聪明太多。

Silence fell among the three occupants of the room and Shinji found he could not figure out what to say. Every time he had visited in the past the girl had been the guiding force of conversation. Luckily she did not disappoint.  
房间里的三个人陷入了沉默，真嗣发现自己不知道该说什么。每次他来访时，那女孩总是主导对话的人。幸运的是，她这次也没有让他失望。

"So what brings you to our humble abode this evening?" Shinji found it eerie that the girl never smiled. Her voice was always cheery, but a smile never reached her face. Asuka on the other hand seemed to be the exact opposite. Asuka was always smiling, but in all the time he'd visited the two of them she'd never said a word to him. The girl did all the talking for the both of them.  
"那么，今晚是什么风把你吹到我们这简陋的小屋来了？" 真嗣觉得那女孩从不微笑的样子有些诡异。她的声音总是很欢快，但笑容从未在她脸上出现过。而明日香则正好相反。明日香总是面带微笑，但在他拜访她们的这段时间里，她从未对他说过一句话。那女孩总是替她们俩说话。

"I'm here to see you… both of you," he added quietly.  
"我来见你了……你们俩，"他轻声补充道。

"You're so kind now. Asuka says you used to be quite selfish. But she's very happy to see you now, aren't you?"  
"你现在这么体贴。明日香说你以前相当自私。但她现在看到你很高兴，不是吗？"

With a little coaxing from the girl, Asuka nodded.  
在女孩的轻轻劝说下，明日香点了点头。

Shinji smiled lightly. He was glad to be wanted.  
真嗣微微一笑。他很高兴自己被需要。

"How have you been doing?" he asked chancing a glance at the girl beside him.  
“你最近怎么样？”他鼓起勇气瞥了一眼身旁的女孩。

"Asuka's been a little grouchy lately, but nothing I can't handle. She doesn't like being held in this place. She doesn't like it at all."  
“明日香最近有点暴躁，不过我还能应付。她不喜欢被关在这个地方。她一点也不喜欢。”

Shinji frowned. 真嗣皱起了眉头。

"But how have _you_ been doing."  
“但你最近怎么样呢？”

"Oh me? I'm well. I don't mind staying here," she said with a shrug of her shoulder. "I just feel bad for poor little Asuka, that's all."  
“哦，我吗？我很好。待在这里我并不介意，”她耸了耸肩说，“我只是为可怜的小明日香感到难过，仅此而已。”

Shinji didn't know what to say to this. He kicked at the air with his dangling feet. It seemed he never knew what to say to this girl. He decided to change the direction of the conversation.  
真嗣不知道该如何回应。他晃着脚踢了踢空气。似乎他永远不知道该如何与这个女孩交谈。他决定改变话题的方向。

"Have the nurses been treating you well?"  
“护士们对你好吗？”

"I don't like them very much. They're not nice like you, Shinji."  
“我不太喜欢她们。她们不像你这么好，真嗣。”

This statement made Shinji quite concerned. He'd heard stories about institutions such as these. Most of those tales were not pretty.  
这句话让真嗣相当担忧。他听说过这类机构的故事，大多数都不是什么好事。

"Have they done anything to you?" he asked. It was a question fueled by fear that quickly turned to quiet anger. When he spoke next, his voice was barely above a whisper. "They haven't touched you, have they? I swear if they harm you…"  
“他们对你做了什么吗？”他问道，这个问题充满了恐惧，很快转化为无声的愤怒。当他再次开口时，声音几乎低不可闻。“他们没碰你吧？我发誓，如果他们伤害了你……”

"Calm down Shinji," she said with a chuckle. It was amazing how she could laugh so lightly without smiling. "They've treated me just fine."  
“冷静点，真嗣，”她轻笑道。令人惊讶的是，她能在不微笑的情况下如此轻松地笑出来。“他们对我很好。”

"Oh," was all he could say. He was embarrassed that he had gotten so worked up over nothing.  
"哦，" 他只能这么回应。他为自己对这无关紧要的事如此激动而感到尴尬。

"But I am concerned with how they treat Asuka."  
"但我很关心他们对待明日香的方式。"

"What do you mean?" "你这是什么意思？"

The girl leaned in conspiratorially, an act which forced Asuka (who had been sitting in the girl's lap the whole time) to bend forward awkwardly. She then proceeded to talk in a light whisper.  
女孩神秘地凑近，这一动作迫使一直坐在她腿上的明日香尴尬地向前弯身。随后，她轻声细语地继续说道。

"Some of the guards have been very mean to Asuka."  
"有些守卫对明日香非常刻薄。"

"How so?" asked Shinji in a similar tone of voice.  
"怎么个刻薄法？" 真嗣用相似的语气问道。"

"They call her mean names, like 'Barbie' and 'Raggedy Ann' right in front of her face. It's like they don't even care if she can hear them."  
"他们当着她的面叫她难听的绰号，比如'芭比'和'破烂安妮'。好像根本不在乎她能不能听见似的。"

Shinji was silent, but the girl pressed on.  
真嗣沉默不语，但女孩继续追问。

"They even refuse to feed her. I've been sharing my food with her all this time. The poor thing's loosing weight. Isn't that horrible?"  
“他们甚至拒绝喂她。我一直把自己的食物分给她。可怜的小家伙瘦了不少。这不是很可怕吗？”

Shinji didn't trust himself to speak. He knew that if he opened his mouth he would say the wrong thing and the girl would hate him again. It would be just like his first visit. That had not went well at all. It wasn't until well after she was done yelling at him and pushing him violently out the door that he realized what he had done wrong.  
真嗣不敢开口说话。他知道一旦张嘴，就会说错话，女孩又会再次恨他。那将和第一次拜访时一样糟糕。那次拜访一点也不顺利。直到她对他大吼大叫，猛力把他推出门外许久之后，他才意识到自己错在哪里。

The girl noticed his reluctance in answering.  
女孩注意到他回答时的犹豫。

"It _is_ horrible, isn't it?"  
“这很可怕，不是吗？”

"Yes," said Shinji quietly. It was the only safe thing for him to say.  
“是的，”真嗣轻声说道。这是他唯一能安全说出口的话。

"I'm sorry I didn't hear you. Could you repeat that?"  
"对不起，我没听清。你能再说一遍吗？"

Shinji hung his head. 真嗣低下了头。

"Yes… it's horrible." "是的……太可怕了。"

The girl's face lightened considerably.  
女孩的脸色明显亮了起来。

"I knew you'd understand Shinji. You're so very nice."  
"我就知道你会理解我的，真嗣。你真是太好了。"

Shinji only nodded as he cast a glance at Asuka. She smiled at him. He did not smile back.  
真嗣只是点了点头，同时瞥了一眼明日香。她朝他微笑，但他没有回应。

"I heard one of the doctors saying the most horrible thing. They were talking about taking Asuka away. Can you believe it?"  
"我听到一位医生说了件最可怕的事。他们在讨论要把明日香带走。你能相信吗？"

"No," said Shinji much quicker this time. He was a slow learner, but that didn't mean he wasn't learning.  
“不，”这次真嗣回答得快多了。他学得慢，但这并不意味着他没有在学。

"Well they were. The doctor said, 'it's time we take that doll away'. You can imagine how distraught Asuka was. She hates dolls."  
“他们确实是这么说的。医生说，‘是时候把那个娃娃拿走了’。你可以想象明日香有多么崩溃。她讨厌娃娃。”

Shinji nodded silently. 真嗣默默地点了点头。

"I won't let them take her away Shinji. I know she can be mean and I know she's not a nice person… but I'm all she has."  
"我不会让他们带走她的，真嗣。我知道她有时很刻薄，也知道她不是个好人……但她只有我了。"

It was true. In this place Asuka and the girl were everything to each other. Shinji understood this, but he hated it. For a while there was nothing he could think to say to the girl. Her world was on verge of shattering and she knew it. But maybe… just maybe…  
这是事实。在这个地方，明日香和那个女孩是彼此的全部。真嗣明白这一点，但他讨厌这样。一时间，他想不出该对那个女孩说什么。她的世界即将崩溃，她自己也清楚。但或许……只是或许……

"Maybe… it would be okay," said Shinji hopefully.  
""或许……一切都会好起来的，""真嗣满怀希望地说道。

"What do you mean?" asked the girl.  
"你是什么意思？" 女孩问道。

"Well maybe… it would help Asuka if the doctors took care of her for a little while."  
"嗯，也许……如果医生们能照顾明日香一段时间，会对她有帮助。"

"You can be so ignorant sometimes, Shinji!" she said hitting him lightly on the arm. The girl's response reminded Shinji so much of old times that he almost forgot where they were. He almost forgot why she was there.  
"你有时候真是无知，真嗣！" 她轻轻地打了一下他的手臂。女孩的反应让真嗣想起了过去的时光，他几乎忘记了他们现在身处何地，也几乎忘记了她为何在此。

"Asuka needs me," said the girl, kicking his memory back into gear. "Those doctors won't take care of her. No one else has ever taken care of her. It's my job. No one else cares."  
"明日香需要我，" 女孩说道，一脚踢开了他的记忆闸门。"那些医生不会好好照顾她的。没有其他人曾经照顾过她。这是我的职责。没有其他人关心。"

Shinji was disheartened at her words, but hope is a resilient thing. If it has to go down it goes down swinging.  
听到她的话，真嗣感到沮丧，但希望是一种坚韧的东西。即使要消逝，也要奋力挣扎。

"What… what if I took care of her?" asked Shinji so quietly it was surprising that the girl even heard him.  
"如果……如果我来照顾她呢？" 真嗣轻声问道，声音之低，令人惊讶女孩竟然听到了。

"You're so sweet Shinji," said the girl. "It's really nice of you, but I couldn't let you do that."  
"你真是太贴心了，真嗣，" 女孩说道。"你真是太好了，但我不能让你这么做。"

Shinji frowned. 真嗣皱起了眉头。

"I'd take good care of her. I'd treat her like she deserves to be treated."  
"我会好好照顾她的。我会像她应得的那样对待她。"

"I don't doubt you Shinji. It's her that I'm worried about. Asuka is a very bad girl sometimes. She can be very mean and very selfish. She likes you very much, but she'd only hurt you Shinji. Asuka always hurts people. Especially nice people like you."  
"“我不怀疑你，真嗣。我担心的是她。有时候，明日香是个非常坏的女孩。她可能非常刻薄和自私。她非常喜欢你，但她只会伤害你，真嗣。明日香总是伤害别人。尤其是像你这样善良的人。”"

Shinji frowned. 真嗣皱起了眉头。

Hope threw its last punch: a sloppy hook to the left.  
希望打出了最后一拳：一个笨拙的左勾拳。

"I wouldn't mind. I like Asuka too. I wouldn't mind being hurt a little."  
"我并不介意。我也喜欢明日香。受点伤也无妨。"

Hope never had a chance.  
希望从未有机会。

"Thank you, but no thank you Shinji. She's my responsibility now. I'm just glad that you come and see her every now and then. It really brightens up her day."  
"谢谢你，不过还是算了吧，真嗣。她现在是我的责任了。我很高兴你时不时来看她，真的让她的一天都明亮起来。"

Shinji hung his head and looked down at the floor. It was a plain white tiled floor. He shook silently as he struggled to keep his emotions under control. It wasn't right for her to say things like that to him. Things that would have meant so much in the past.  
真嗣低下了头，目光落在地板上。那是一片普通的白色瓷砖地面。他默默地颤抖着，努力控制自己的情绪。她那样对他说话是不对的。那些话在过去对他来说意义重大。

"Asuka did tell me one thing you could do for her. She'd tell you herself, but she's just too shy to ask. It's funny how rude she is to everyone when she's really so shy inside."  
“明日香确实告诉了我一件事，你可以为她做。她本想亲自告诉你，但她实在太害羞了，不好意思开口。真有趣，她对每个人都那么粗鲁，其实内心却如此害羞。”

"What is it?" asked Shinji eagerly looking up from the ground. He casually wiped at his eyes knowing that it was futile. She always was too smart for him.  
“是什么事？”真嗣急切地抬起头问道，他随意地擦了擦眼睛，知道这是徒劳的。她总是比他聪明太多。

"She wants you… to hold her. Just until she falls asleep."  
"她想要你……抱着她，直到她睡着。"

Shinji swallowed hard. He wondered what the nurses would think if they saw what he was about to do. They already thought he was crazy. Maybe this would solidify that view. Against his better judgment he decided to comply with Asuka's request. It was the least he could do.  
真嗣艰难地咽了口唾沫。他不知道如果护士们看到他即将要做的事情会怎么想。她们已经认为他疯了。也许这会巩固她们的看法。尽管内心有所抗拒，他还是决定满足明日香的要求。这是他至少能做的。

"Ok," he said as he scooped Asuka into his arms.  
"好吧，"他说着，将明日香抱入怀中。"

The girl watched in wonder. She stared at the two of them with a look that was so childish it was almost comical. But Shinji didn't quite feel like laughing.  
女孩好奇地观望着。她盯着他们俩，那表情如此稚气，几乎显得滑稽。但真嗣却笑不出来。

"She wants you to rock her. Could you rock her until she falls asleep?"  
“她想让你摇晃她。你能摇晃她直到她睡着吗？”

The girl looked on with longing, as he obliged. When she spoke again her voice was filled with excitement and something like disbelief.  
女孩带着渴望的眼神看着他照做。当她再次开口时，声音里充满了兴奋和一种难以置信的感觉。

"I've never seen her look so happy. She's very peaceful now Shinji. She wants me to thank you for her."  
"我从没见过她如此开心。现在她非常平静，真嗣。她想让我替她谢谢你。"

"You're welcome," said Shinji awkwardly as he looked down at Asuka's smiling face. He couldn't shake the feeling of uneasiness that had hit him the moment he took Asuka into his arms.  
"不客气，"真嗣尴尬地说道，目光落在明日香微笑的脸上。他无法摆脱那种从抱住明日香那一刻起就袭来的不安感。"

Shinji continued to rock Asuka to sleep for quite some time. It honestly felt like an eternity to the boy, but he never stopped. Relief washed over him, when the girl spoke again.  
真嗣继续摇晃着让明日香入睡，持续了相当长的时间。对男孩来说，这感觉就像永恒一样漫长，但他从未停止。当女孩再次开口时，他感到了一阵解脱。

"You're so nice Shinji. So very, very nice. Why do you keep coming here to see us? You should be out with other nice people having a nice time."  
"你真是太好了，真嗣。非常好，非常好。你为什么总是来这里看我们？你应该和其他好人一起出去，享受美好时光。"

For once in his life, Shinji knew exactly what he needed to do.  
在一生中的这一刻，真嗣清楚地知道自己需要做什么。

He looked the girl in the eyes and said, "I came here because I love you, Asuka."  
他直视着女孩的眼睛，说道：“我来这里是因为我爱你，明日香。”

"She loves you too," said the girl, effectively crushing his spirits.  
"她也爱你," 女孩说道，彻底粉碎了他的希望。

As hard as it was, Shinji kept himself under control. He wanted her to understand. He needed her to know.  
尽管艰难，真嗣还是控制住了自己。他希望她能理解。他需要她知道。

"Asuka's not the only one I love," said Shinji once again forcing himself to meet the girl's eyes. It was not an easy task.  
"不只是明日香，我也爱着其他人，" 真嗣再次强迫自己直视女孩的眼睛。这并非易事。

"That's sweet, Shinji. That's very, very sweet."  
"真甜蜜，真嗣。非常非常甜蜜。"

Her answer gave him some encouragement but he couldn't help but notice that she had not said those three words back. Still, he was content to know that she cared.  
她的回答给了他一些鼓励，但他不禁注意到她并没有回以那三个字。尽管如此，他还是满足于知道她在乎。

"Shinji…" “真嗣……”

"Yes, Asuka?" "什么事，明日香？"

"Don't be silly Shinji, Asuka's asleep."  
"别傻了，真嗣，明日香睡着了。"

"Oh…"

"I know we've asked a lot of you since you've been here, but there's one more thing I'd like for you to do?"  
"我知道自从你来到这里，我们已经让你承担了很多，但还有一件事我希望你能做？"

"What is it?" “怎么了？”

"I don't know if I should ask…" said the girl timidly. "Asuka wouldn't like it. She can be so selfish sometimes, so very, very selfish. But do you think… maybe it's okay if I'm selfish this time too?"  
"我不知道该不该问……" 女孩怯生生地说。"明日香不会喜欢的。她有时很自私，非常非常自私。但你觉得……也许这次我也自私一下，可以吗？"

"It's okay," said Shinji without a second thought. It was all the encouragement the girl needed.  
"没关系，" 真嗣毫不犹豫地说。这对女孩来说已经足够鼓励了。

"Would it be okay… if you held me for a while too?"  
"可以……也让我靠一会儿吗？"

It was harder for Shinji in that moment. He wanted to scream. He wanted cry. He wanted to run. But he steadied himself because he needed to hold it in for the girl. He nodded to her silently.  
那一刻，对真嗣来说尤为艰难。他想尖叫，想哭泣，想逃离。但他稳住了自己，因为他需要为这个女孩忍耐。他默默地点了点头。

She carefully removed Asuka from Shinji's lap and gently laid her next to him on the bed. Shinji then leaned his back up against the headboard with his legs spread apart upon the mattress. The girl sat between his legs and leaned the back of her head upon his chest. She then grabbed his hands and wrapped his arms around her middle.  
她小心翼翼地将明日香从真嗣的膝上移开，轻轻地让她躺在床上的他旁边。随后，真嗣背靠床头板，双腿分开躺在床垫上。女孩坐在他的双腿之间，将后脑勺靠在他的胸前。接着，她握住他的双手，环绕在自己的腰间。

It was definitely an awkward moment for Shinji. He'd never been so close to anyone in all of his adolescent life. But there was something about her warmth and presence that was calming to him. Even though a voice in his head was telling him this was a bad idea, he couldn't find it in himself to move.  
对真嗣来说，这无疑是个尴尬的时刻。他从未在青春期如此接近过任何人。但她的温暖和存在感却让他感到平静。尽管脑海中有个声音告诉他这是个坏主意，他却无法让自己挪动分毫。

"This is very nice Shinji," said the girl. Her voice was somehow softer now. Less formal. "If it wasn't for Asuka I could stay like this forever."  
“这样真好，真嗣。”女孩说道，她的声音此刻变得柔和了许多，不再那么正式。“如果不是因为明日香，我愿意永远这样待下去。”

Hearing her say such a thing brought Shinji to the edge. When he looked down at Asuka's forever-smiling face he was slightly pushed over. His body began to shake outside of his control. His vision blurred. He wanted so desperately to hold in the tears, but there was nothing he could do. It was just too much. She was too much.  
听到她这么说，真嗣几乎要崩溃了。当他低头看着明日香那永远微笑的脸庞时，他感到自己被轻轻推了一把。他的身体开始不由自主地颤抖，视线变得模糊。他拼命想要忍住泪水，却无能为力。这一切，她的一切，都太过沉重了。

"Why are you crying, Shinji?"  
"真嗣，你为什么哭呢？"

He shook his head. There was no answer he could give that she would understand.  
他摇了摇头。他无法给出她能理解的答案。

"You shouldn't cry… Asuka is very sad when you cry."  
"你不应该哭……你一哭，明日香也会很难过。"

He struggled for a while, but finally brought his voice under some semblance of control. It still shook as he talked.  
他挣扎了一会儿，但最终还是设法让自己的声音听起来有些控制。尽管如此，说话时仍带着颤抖。

"But Asuka is asleep." “但明日香还在睡觉。”

The girl thought about this for a while, but soon came up with the appropriate response.  
女孩思考了一阵，不久便想出了合适的回应。

"It makes me sad to see you cry too."  
"看到你哭，我也感到难过。"

This statement caused Shinji to cry harder, wetting the girl's hair with his tears.  
这句话让真嗣哭得更厉害了，泪水浸湿了女孩的头发。

_She can't say that now. It's not fair. This isn't fair.  
她现在不能这么说。这不公平。这太不公平了。_

"Please stop," she said. "If you keep crying you'll wake Asuka up and, she'll be very mad if she sees us like this."  
"请停下来，"她说，"如果你继续哭，会把明日香吵醒的，她看到我们这样会很生气的。"

With much effort Shinji managed to bring himself back under control. His tears ceased to flow, but his breathing was heavy and he still shook a little bit.  
经过一番努力，真嗣终于控制住了自己。他的眼泪止住了，但呼吸依然沉重，身体还微微颤抖。

"That's better," said the girl. "But if Asuka was awake she still would not be pleased."  
"这样好多了，"女孩说，"但如果明日香醒着，她还是不会高兴的。"

"Why not?" he asked with a quiver in his voice.  
"为什么不呢？" 他的声音带着颤抖问道。

"She'd want you to smile. It makes her so happy to see you smile."  
"她会希望你微笑的。看到你笑，她会非常开心。"

"But Asuka's still asleep," said Shinji slowly as he still attempted to catch his breath.  
"但明日香还在睡觉，" 真嗣缓缓地说，仍在努力平复呼吸。

"That's okay," said the girl. "I'm happy when you smile too."  
“没关系，”女孩说，“你笑的时候我也感到快乐。”

There was never a time in all his visits when Shinji wanted to break down more. His anxiety built up inside of him like a shaken can of cola, just waiting to explode. He knew that later, when he was in the safety of his room, he would let it out. He would lock the door and ignore Misato's pleas for entrance. He would cry for hours. Maybe days if he felt up to it. He would cry until the tears could never fall again. But right now, in this moment he held it in and smiled.  
在他所有的拜访中，从未有一次像现在这样，真嗣如此渴望崩溃。他的焦虑在他体内累积，就像一瓶摇晃过的可乐，只待爆发。他知道，稍后当他回到自己安全的房间时，他会释放这一切。他会锁上门，无视美里恳求进入的声音。他会哭泣数小时，或许如果他觉得可以的话，甚至会哭上几天。他会哭到泪水再也无法落下为止。但此刻，在这个瞬间，他忍住了，并露出了微笑。

He smiled for the girl.  
他为女孩而微笑。

And for the first time he could remember, the girl smiled back.  
而这是他记忆中第一次，女孩回以微笑。

**Author's Notes and Idiot Proofing**:  
作者笔记及傻瓜式说明：

Yeah, it's depressing. It's probably the saddest thing I've ever written. The inspiration came from nowhere. It was like one moment I was walking on campus and the next I had this idea in my head. But if I am to be completely honest after re-reading the story it reminded me a bit of the fourth chapter of "I Knew Him When" by Adam Kadom (I recommend it highly).  
是啊，这挺让人沮丧的。可能这是我写过最悲伤的东西了。灵感不知从何而来，就像我走在校园里，下一秒这个想法就突然出现在脑海中。但说实话，重读这篇故事时，它让我想起了亚当·卡多姆的《我认识他时》的第四个千夜故事（我强烈推荐它）。

That's all I have for Author's Notes. It's time for the Idiot Proofing.  
这就是我的作者笔记。接下来是防傻瓜指南。

Now before you guys go calling me a jerk, I just want you to know that I consider none of my readers idiots... I just call them that because it amuses me. I seriously mean no offense by using the term, but I think it's pretty funny. So I'm going to do it anyways.  
在你们开始叫我混蛋之前，我想让你们知道，我并不认为我的读者们是傻瓜……我只是这么称呼他们，因为这让我觉得有趣。我真心无意冒犯，但我觉得这挺好笑的。所以无论如何，我还是会这么做。

In reading this story, there are five levels of idiocy that I will address. If you fall somewhere inbetween, I recommend using the higher level of idiocy. Better to underestimate your self than hurt your self trying to comprehend something you can't. (I kid, I kid)  
在阅读这篇故事时，我将讨论五个愚蠢等级。如果你处于中间某个位置，我建议采用更高的愚蠢等级。宁可低估自己，也不要在试图理解无法理解的事物时伤害自己。（开玩笑的，开玩笑的）

Idiot Level Zero (Too Smart for my good): Congratulations smart reader. You understood everything that's going on in the story. I don't have to explain the characters or the setting or what happened to Shinji during his first visit. You're the type of reader that makes my job easy, but slightly less fun. I can't insult you because you're too intelligent... smart alack.  
愚蠢等级零（聪明过头）：恭喜你，聪明的读者。你完全理解故事中发生的一切。我不需要解释角色、背景或真嗣第一次访问时发生了什么。你是那种让我的工作变得轻松但稍显无趣的读者。我无法侮辱你，因为你太聪明了……自作聪明的家伙。

Idiot Level One (Understandable Stupidity): Hey it's ok. You're really not that stupid. You're probably just missing some vital information. Maybe you haven't seen the whole series. I bet you're thinking, "there's definitely something more to this story than I understand." That's a good thing. An idiot who knows he's an idiot is much better off than one that does not. My advice to you is to look into Asuka's background information (particularly that which involves her family). Wikipedia is a good source for that if you don't have the DVDs readily at hand. Re-read the story. If you still don't understand what's going on then I don't mean to insult your intelligence, but you should probably move up an Idiot Level.  
一级傻瓜（可理解的愚蠢）：嘿，没关系。你其实没那么笨。可能只是缺少了一些关键信息。也许你还没看完整个系列。我敢打赌你在想，“这个故事肯定有我还没理解的部分。”这是件好事。知道自己傻的傻瓜比不知道的强多了。我的建议是去了解一下明日香（Asuka）的背景信息（特别是与她家庭相关的部分）。如果你手头没有 DVD，维基百科是个不错的来源。重新读一遍故事。如果还是不明白发生了什么，我无意冒犯你的智力，但你可能需要提升一下傻瓜等级了。

Idiot Level Two (Eh... I'm sure you're very athletic): So you still don't quite get it. It's not your fault. Your parents probably didn't read to you enough as a child. Just pay close attention and follow my directions and you'll get it. The girl is someone you know from the series. She is not an original character. (I'll give you a moment to let that information settle in... got it?... oh... a few more seconds then... Good). Now that you have that information look very closely at the dialogue in the story and also the descriptions used for Asuka. They are very important to understanding this story. Look particularly at the lines right before the girl asks Shinji to hold her. Isn't it interesting that he didn't notice Asuka was sleeping? Please tell me that's interesting... because if it isn't you'll have to move on to...  
二货级别（呃...我确信你运动能力很强）：看来你还是没完全明白。这不是你的错。可能你父母小时候没给你读过足够多的书。只需集中注意力，听从我的指示，你就会懂的。这个女孩是系列中你认识的角色，并非原创人物。（给你点时间消化这个信息...明白了吗？...哦...再等几秒...好了）。既然你已经掌握了这些信息，仔细阅读故事中的对话以及对明日香的描述。它们对理解这个故事至关重要。特别注意女孩请求真嗣抱她之前的那些台词。真嗣竟然没注意到明日香在睡觉，这难道不有趣吗？请告诉我你觉得有趣...因为如果不然，你可能得继续...

Idiot Level Three (Lost at Sea without a Compass): You poor lost thing... you still don't understand. And you're trying so hard. Well have no fear, I shall pilot your ship and point you in the right direction. But beware: the journey may blow your mind. Prepare yourself my friend, you are in for quite a shock. ASUKA IS NOT ASUKA! There I said it. The entity that has been called Asuka throughout this story is not Asuka. This raises so many questions: What is this thing we've been calling Asuka? Where is the real Asuka? Why is this crazy guy talking about ships and compasses? Well ignore that last question and pay close attention. Look at one line in the story... just one line. When Shinji says, "I love you Asuka." Who is he looking at? Who is he talking to? Come on... you can do this. I believe in you! But just incase you still don't understand...  
三级白痴（在海上迷失无指南针）：你这可怜的迷途羔羊...你还是没明白。而你正竭尽全力。别担心，我会为你掌舵，指引你正确的方向。但小心：这段旅程可能会让你大开眼界。准备好，我的朋友，你将经历一场不小的震撼。ASUKA 不是 ASUKA！我说出来了。一直以来在这故事中被称为 Asuka 的实体，并非真正的 Asuka。这引出了无数疑问：我们口中的 Asuka 究竟是什么？真正的 Asuka 在哪里？为何这个疯子在谈论船和指南针？好吧，忽略最后一个问题，集中注意力。看故事中的一行...仅此一行。当 Shinji 说：“我爱你，Asuka。”他在看谁？他在对谁说？来吧...你能做到的。我相信你！但以防万一你仍未理解...

Idiot Level Four (For the Criminaly Stupid... how are you reading this?): You very unfortunate person. Did your mother drop you on the head as a child? Do you live under high voltage power lines? Did you eat a rather large amount of lead-based paint chips in your infancy? I can't imagine how lost and confused you are in your own little world. May God have mercy on your soul. I'm going to break this down for you in terms you can't mistake.  
四级白痴（针对极度愚蠢的罪犯...你怎么还在读这个？）：你这个不幸的人。你小时候是不是被你妈摔过脑袋？你是不是住在高压电线下面？你婴儿时期是不是吃了不少含铅的油漆碎片？我无法想象你在自己的小世界里有多么迷茫和困惑。愿上帝怜悯你的灵魂。我会用你无法误解的方式为你分解解释。

Asuka is a Doll 明日香是个玩偶

The Girl is Asuka 那个女孩是明日香

Shinji is Shinji 真嗣就是真嗣

If you don't get that then, I'm sorry because I've done all I can do for you. Seek professional help!  
如果你不明白这一点，那我很抱歉，我已经尽力了。请寻求专业帮助吧！

Remember... all that I've said, I've said in love... or jest... or in blatant disregard for your feelings. The point is, this story is pretty subtle so it's understandable if you didn't understand it (yes even you, Level Four Idiot). I hope I've clarified this for everyone once and for all. Thanks for reading.  
记住……我所说的一切，都是出于爱……或是玩笑……或是对你感受的公然无视。关键是，这个故事相当微妙，所以如果你没理解它也是可以理解的（没错，即使是四级白痴）。我希望我已经为所有人彻底澄清了这一点。感谢阅读。

### Chapter 2

**AN:** Continuing this story is a decision that I still have somewhat mixed feelings about. I felt that the first chapter stood alone perfectly and I don't want to detract from that in any way. However, the ideas I have lined up for the rest of this story (probably just this chapter and then one more) are pretty solid. I didn't fully explore the complexities of the situation that Asuka and Shinji are in and I feel that these next chapters will accomplish that. Still, I understand if you would prefer not to read the rest of this, as it truly is unnecessary in the grand scheme of the story. That being said, I know most of you who liked the first chapter will read this anyways… so enjoy.  
AN：继续这个故事的决定，我至今仍有些许矛盾情绪。我认为第一章已自成一体，完美独立，不想以任何方式削弱其完整性。然而，我为后续情节（大概就这一章再加一章）构思的想法颇为扎实。我并未完全挖掘出明日香和真嗣所处情境的复杂性，而接下来的章节将致力于此。尽管如此，我理解若您觉得后续内容在故事大局中并非必需，选择不继续阅读也是完全合理的。话虽如此，我知道喜欢第一章的你们多数还是会继续阅读……那么，请享受接下来的故事吧。

And because I don't feel like adding this at the end as usual, Thank you very much to Mr. Roboto… also known as Eric Blair. Without his pre-reading this chapter wouldn't be what it is today. I'd like to think that my word processor is like a mine. And I'm a miner. And the words I write are like jewels. And Eric Blair is like the jeweler that makes it shine pretty-like in the light. Either that, or my word processor is a litter box. And I'm like a cat with digestive problems. And my writing is like kitty litter mixed with kitty crap. And Eric Blair is the loving pet owner who scoops out most of the crap and sprays air freshener all around the area. Either way, thanks man.  
因为我不太想像往常一样在结尾加上这些，非常感谢 Mr. Roboto……也就是 Eric Blair。没有他的预读，这一章就不会是今天的样子。我愿意认为我的文字处理器就像一座矿山，而我是一名矿工。我所写的文字就像宝石。而 Eric Blair 就像是那位珠宝匠，让它在光线下闪闪发亮。要么，我的文字处理器就像一个猫砂盆。而我就像一只消化不良的猫。我的写作就像混合了猫屎的猫砂。而 Eric Blair 则是那位充满爱心的宠物主人，铲走了大部分的猫屎，并在周围喷洒空气清新剂。无论如何，感谢你，伙计。

He had to get up in the morning. The teacher was always on his back for sleeping and being so tired. He wished he had a good excuse, but he never could lie like Toji or Kensuke. He left the TV on and put on his SDAT. The music was familiar. Sometimes his head would bob and sometimes his fingers would tap. And it was all a bit like a hum in the throat that sort of projected outward and infected the air and sucked back inward to fill his body with each and every note. And if he listened real hard sometimes he heard little bits of the song that he never heard before. It was rather interesting to hear these parts and it was almost like the song was new again.  
他早上还得起床。老师总是因为他打瞌睡和疲惫不堪而责备他。他希望自己有个好借口，但他从来不像真治或真嗣那样能撒谎。他让电视开着，戴上 SDAT。音乐很熟悉。有时他的头会随着节奏摇晃，有时手指会轻敲。这一切都像喉咙里发出的哼声，向外扩散感染空气，再吸入体内，每个音符都填满他的身体。如果他仔细听，有时会听到以前从未注意过的歌曲片段。发现这些部分相当有趣，几乎让歌曲焕然一新。

But is it really 2 already? Did he doze off or something? He must have and he told Misato that he was sorry that she had to wake him. That sad look on her face told him that she knew something was wrong- though really he had no reason to feel bad- and she told him to get some sleep, he looked like the walking dead. He tried to smile at her joke and bid her goodnight and sat there staring at the now blank TV screen because she had turned it off when she found him there.  
但真的已经 2 点了吗？他是不是打了个盹？一定是的，他向美里道歉，因为她不得不叫醒他。她脸上那悲伤的表情告诉他，她知道有些不对劲——尽管他并没有理由感到难过——她让他去睡一会儿，他看起来就像个活死人。他试图对她开的玩笑报以微笑，向她道晚安，然后坐在那里盯着已经关掉的电视屏幕，因为美里发现他在那里时把它关掉了。

And he had to go to his room because if Misato found him sleeping there again she'd give him that sad look and he'd have to feel bad. But he was not avoiding his room so much as dreading it because to avoid something means that there's a chance of not seeing it. So he forced himself to get up- each limb felt like a ton of bricks- and when he got to his room he closed the door and locked it. But why did he lock it? Because he can't escape what he's here to do and it doesn't matter if he tries not to or tries hard to because even though he pushed it back, it's all coming out sooner or later.  
他不得不回到自己的房间，因为如果美里再次发现他在那里睡觉，她会露出那种悲伤的表情，而他则会感到内疚。但他并非在逃避房间，更多的是在畏惧它，因为逃避意味着有可能不会面对它。于是他强迫自己起身——每一步都像拖着千斤重担——当他到达房间时，他关上门并锁上。但他为什么要锁门呢？因为他无法逃避自己在这里要做的事，无论他是否努力尝试不去面对，即便他暂时将其推开，终究还是会到来。

But no! God no! He was not going to do it again. He couldn't because- _it's hard to see you like that_- just because she hurt him didn't mean he had to hurt himself. And it wasn't his fault. He only wanted to help her and _he told them_ she needed it but now he wasn't so sure what she needed anymore. And if he was just going to bed, then he really should turn off the light because when you're sleeping you don't need to see anything. Like her pleading eyes, or her burning hatred, or that one time when she dared to smile. So he turned off the lights and stayed in the darkness and looked around and saw all the nothing all around. Closing his eyes didn't help because behind each lid lay the nothingness and in front of each eye lay the nothingness because it was everywhere.  
但不行！天哪，不行！他不会再这么做了。他不能，因为——看到你那样真的很难受——仅仅因为她伤害了他，并不意味着他必须自伤。而且这不是他的错。他只是想帮她，他告诉他们她需要帮助，但现在他不确定她到底需要什么了。如果他只是要睡觉，那么他真的应该关灯，因为当你睡觉时不需要看到任何东西。比如她恳求的眼神，或是她燃烧的恨意，又或是那次她竟敢微笑。于是他关了灯，留在黑暗中，环顾四周，看到周围全是虚无。闭上眼睛也无济于事，因为每只眼睑后都是虚无，每只眼睛前也是虚无，因为虚无无处不在。

And- _stop it stop it stop it!_  
别——停下，停下，停下！

He was too old for this, and he had to be a man because- _I need your help Shinji thank god you're here-_ so why couldn't he pull his hands away to stop himself from being seen (_by what?_). And it's kind of funny how even now she could care so much one second and then push him down the next.  
他年纪太大了，他得像个男人，因为——我需要你的帮助，真嗣，感谢上帝你在这里——那他为什么不能把手抽开，不让自己被看见（被什么？）。而且有点好笑的是，即使现在，她可以在一秒钟内如此关心，下一秒又把他推开。

It was sorta like rolling down that hill. The other kids didn't let him play with them. No, they didn't stop him. He could just tell they didn't like it when he was around, it was in their eyes and the way they would all hurdle together and show their backs to him. But they let him watch, because no one cared if he wasn't in the way.  
那感觉有点像从山坡上滚下来。其他孩子不让他一起玩。不，他们没有阻止他。他只是能感觉到他们不喜欢他在旁边，那种眼神和他们会聚在一起背对着他的方式。但他们让他看着，因为没人介意他不在路上碍事。

The hill couldn't have been that big and the kids all seemed to really have fun daring each other to see who could get down the fastest, daring each and everyone of them and Shinji would have given anything for one of them to come up to him and dare him, calling him a chicken or a wimp as they jokingly did each other.  
那山坡应该没那么大，孩子们似乎真的很享受互相挑战，看谁能最快滚下去，挑衅着每一个人，而真嗣愿意付出一切，只为其中一人能走到他面前，挑衅他，叫他胆小鬼或懦夫，就像他们互相开玩笑那样。

But no one came and when they left he gave it a try because it really did look like a heck of a lot of fun. The way they screamed and yelled and laughed, and most of them rarely got hurt, just a few small cuts when they did.  
但没人来，当他们离开后，他尝试了一下，因为那看起来确实非常有趣。他们尖叫、喊叫、大笑，而且大多数人很少受伤，只是偶尔会有几处小擦伤。

So he clutched his arms tight to his sides and lied himself down in the grass telling himself to "Go… now… now… now…" and he had to convince himself of all the reasons he had to let go.  
于是他紧紧抱住双臂，蜷缩在草地上，心中默念着“走吧……现在……现在……现在……”，他不得不说服自己，放弃的理由有千千万。

_**"Where is Asuka?" “明日香在哪儿？”**_

And then he was rolling and it was something that shocked him greatly. It was slow going at first and very bumpy and he couldn't remember why he wanted to do it in the first place. Suddenly he wanted to stop, but he told himself that he had to go because all the other kids- _you're just like the rest of them-_ all went down and they had so much fun.  
接着他开始翻滚，这一举动让他大吃一惊。起初进展缓慢且颠簸不已，他甚至记不清为何要这么做。突然间，他想停下来，但他告诉自己必须继续，因为其他孩子——你和他们没什么两样——都滚下去了，他们玩得那么开心。

And suddenly the ground was whizzing underneath him, and his vision blurred with flashes of grass and mud and sky and grass and mud and sky again. And the ride stayed bumpy and he only picked up more speed and it began to hurt so much that he couldn't believe a pain like this could exist inside of him. The faster he went the worse he felt and he screamed and he yelled and he thrashed about and the bitterness in his heart increased and he couldn't think of anyone whose life he wouldn't trade places with in a second, just to end this ride, just to end this pain. Because he was hurting himself and if other people hurt you and you hurt yourself then who's going to love you?  
突然间，地面在他身下呼啸而过，他的视线被草地、泥土、天空和草地、泥土、天空的闪现所模糊。这段旅程依旧颠簸，他加速得更快，疼痛开始变得如此剧烈，以至于他无法相信自己体内能存在这样的痛苦。他越快，感觉就越糟，他尖叫、大喊、挣扎，心中的苦涩愈发浓烈，他无法想到有谁的生活他不立刻交换，只为结束这段旅程，只为结束这痛苦。因为他正在伤害自己，如果别人伤害你，你又伤害自己，那么谁还会爱你呢？

_Are you alright… can I come in… Please open the door… don't do this Shinji…  
你还好吗…我能进来吗…请开门…别这样，真嗣…_

But that didn't keep him from rolling along, because the rolling now felt like falling.  
但这并没有阻止他继续滚动，因为现在滚动的感觉就像坠落。

Because he was caught up in the downward decent and in that constant turning motion and he tried not to break anything too important and he tried not to make her worry too much, but he was stuck. No, it couldn't have been such a big hill at all, but as he reached the bottom he realized one frightening truth.  
因为他被卷入了这急速下降和不断旋转的动作中，他努力不弄坏任何太重要的东西，也尽量不让她太过担心，但他陷入了困境。不，那根本不可能是什么大山丘，但当他到达底部时，他意识到一个令人惊恐的事实。

He didn't know how to stop.  
他不知道如何停下来。

### Chapter 3

When Shinji woke up he found himself staring at a wall hunched in a corner of his room with his knees drawn up to his chest. It didn't take him long to realize what a stupid position this was to be in. And yet it took him all of 5 minutes to convince himself to move. He stood up slowly, carefully as if he was afraid to fall over, and he surveyed the room.  
当真嗣醒来时，他发现自己蜷缩在房间的一角，膝盖紧贴着胸口，目光呆滞地盯着墙壁。他很快意识到这个姿势有多愚蠢。然而，他花了整整五分钟才说服自己动弹一下。他慢慢地站起来，小心翼翼，仿佛害怕摔倒，然后环视了一下房间。

Ha, I made a mess  
哈，我搞得一团糟

He laughed. It wasn't very funny but he forced himself because when you laugh it's much harder to tell if the world is laughing with you or at you. But laughing wasn't the most pleasant experience as it alerted him to how weak and fragile he felt. His eyes felt dry and stingy and his stomach ached when he moved funny, or when bent over, or when he breathed. He ignored all this because it was time to clean.  
他笑了。这并不好笑，但他强迫自己笑，因为当你笑的时候，很难分辨世界是和你一起笑，还是在嘲笑你。但笑并不是最愉快的体验，因为它让他意识到自己感觉多么虚弱和脆弱。他的眼睛感到干涩刺痛，每当他动作滑稽、弯腰或呼吸时，胃都会痛。他忽略了这一切，因为该打扫了。

He gathered up the pillows and sheets that were strewn about the floor and began to make his bed. After he finished with that, he moved over to his dresser and put the drawers back in. Luckily he had avoided knocking most of the clothes out, so the process didn't take that long. It was kind of gross putting all the trash back in the overturned trashcan. He tried to keep his hands away from the sticky stuff and use the paper to grab onto all the gum and tissues (particularly those with visual signs of usage). This alone was enough to make him somewhat regret his hasty choice of objects to vandalize, but he didn't feel guilty until he found the necklace with the cross hanging on it lying on the floor with its chain broken. He promptly picked it up and put it on his nightstand and not around his neck. He didn't need anyone else's burdens to bear.  
他收拾起散落一地的枕头和床单，开始整理床铺。完成后，他走到梳妆台前，将抽屉重新装好。幸运的是，他大部分衣服都没有被撞出来，所以这个过程并不太久。把所有垃圾重新塞回倒置的垃圾桶里有点恶心。他尽量让手远离黏糊糊的东西，用纸巾夹住所有的口香糖和纸巾（尤其是那些有明显使用痕迹的）。光是这一点就足以让他对之前匆忙选择的破坏对象感到些许后悔，但直到他发现地板上那条链子断裂、挂着十字架的项链时，他才真正感到内疚。他迅速捡起它，放在床头柜上，而不是戴在脖子上。他不需要承担别人的负担。

After that there wasn't much to do. So he sat on his bed and stared at the door. He must have sat there for half an hour just staring before he decided to face the inevitable. By then it was getting late and if he didn't hurry up he'd have to miss school. And that was the one thing she wouldn't allow him to do. She'd tolerate his moods, let him destroy his room and burry himself in solitude, but she'd never let him skip a single day of school.  
自那之后，也没什么可做的了。于是他坐在床上，盯着房门。他一定在那里坐了半个小时，只是盯着，直到他决定面对不可避免的事情。那时天色已晚，如果他不快点，就会错过学校。而这是她绝不允许他做的。她会容忍他的情绪，让他毁掉自己的房间，埋头于孤独，但她绝不会让他逃学一天。

Irony. Better face her now.  
真是讽刺。还是现在就去面对她吧。

He opened the door a crack.  
他轻轻地打开门缝。

"Oh Shinji." "哦，真嗣。"

He wished she wouldn't sit there right outside the door like that. Like everything was hinging on when he'd show his face again. It made him feel guiltier than ever. Sometimes when he was feeling particularly mistrusting, he thought that that might be her intentions. But he always felt bad about such thoughts later. Misato, for all her faults and flaws, was a very nice person.  
他希望她不要那样坐在门外，仿佛一切都在等待他再次露面。这让他比以往任何时候都感到更内疚。有时当他特别多疑时，他会认为那可能是她的意图。但事后他总是为这些想法感到难过。尽管美里有许多缺点和瑕疵，但她是一个非常好的人。

"Hey," he threw out weakly. His voice sounded shallow to his own ears. His throat felt soar.  
"嘿，"他虚弱地开口。他的声音听起来空洞，他自己都觉得喉咙发痛。

"Hey," said Misato back with a sad wavering smile. She stood up from her spot on the floor and moved so that he could open the door. When he finally came out into the hallway a pair of arms came around him, just as he knew they would. It was always sort of peculiar the way she pressed herself into him. His nose didn't quite clear her shoulder so half his face was stuck there. One of her hands found its way behind his head, while the other stayed at the small of his back. Both of them constantly pulling him in. Pushing him against her with consistent force.  
“嘿，”美里回以一个悲伤而颤抖的微笑。她从地板上站起来，挪动位置以便他能开门。当他终于走出房间来到走廊时，一双臂膀如他所料地环抱住了他。她总是以一种奇特的方式紧贴着他，他的鼻子没能完全越过她的肩膀，半张脸都埋在那里。她的一只手摸索到他的后脑，另一只则停留在他的腰背之间，两人不断地将他拉近，用持续的力量将他推向她。

She smelled like perfume, smoke, and sweat. Her shirt tasted like cotton. He wished he'd had time to close his mouth. Her hands felt warm and damp and soft and springy like wet temper foam straight out of the microwave. Her hair fell loosely around them both like a loose mesh shield against reality. And her voice, when she spoke so softly that he almost couldn't hear, it was like a river flowing over jagged rocks. A dangerous thing of motion and beauty.  
她散发着香水、烟和汗的味道。她的衬衫尝起来像棉花。他希望自己有时间闭上嘴。她的手感觉温暖、潮湿、柔软且富有弹性，就像刚从微波炉里拿出来的湿泡沫海绵。她的头发松散地环绕在他们周围，像一张松散的网盾，隔绝现实。而当她轻声细语，几乎让他听不见时，她的声音就像流经尖锐岩石的河流，一种充满动感与美丽的危险之物。

This was his forgiveness. This was his punishment.  
这是他的宽恕。这是他的惩罚。

"It's always been so hard for you," she said. "I wish you'd let me in there so I could help, but I know you want to deal with these things alone. You never did know how to share yourself with others and I understand that. I respect that. But I think you should see the doctor again. I know you said he didn't help, but maybe you should see him anyways. Sometimes I wonder if I should see him myself. We're all having such a hard time now aren't we? But we'll make it through this because we always do."  
"你总是这么艰难，"她说。"我希望你能让我进入你的世界，这样我就能帮忙，但我知道你想独自面对这些。你从不懂得如何与他人分享自己，我理解这一点。我尊重这一点。但我认为你应该再去看看医生。我知道你说过他帮不上忙，但也许你还是应该去见见他。有时候我在想，我自己是不是也应该去看看他。我们现在都过得很艰难，不是吗？但我们一定能挺过去，因为我们总是能做到。"

She never let up on her embrace.  
她始终没有松开拥抱。

"I wish I could ask Ritsuko what to do. She never did have any of the answers. That woman, for all her intelligence, knew just as little as I did. But when I asked her something and she didn't know the answer, I knew that it was a problem that would stump anyone and it wasn't just me being too stupid to figure it out."  
"我真希望能问问律子该怎么办。她从未有过任何答案。那个女人，尽管聪明绝顶，知道的并不比我多。但当我问她问题而她不知道答案时，我知道那是一个会让任何人困惑的问题，并不是我太笨而无法解决。"

She laughed softly and ran a hand through his hair.  
她轻声笑了，手指穿过他的发丝。

"I'd even ask Kaji if he were here. The man was about as unreliable as anyone could be, but if nothing else he'd give an honest perspective. He'd tell me if I was screwing this up or if it was just messed up to begin with. But he's not here anymore and it's funny because I convinced myself long ago that I wouldn't miss him."  
“即使加持在这里，我也会问他的。那个人虽然不可靠到了极点，但至少他会给出诚实的看法。他会告诉我是不是搞砸了，或者从一开始就一团糟。但他已经不在了，真讽刺，因为我很久以前就告诉自己我不会想念他。”

Her hand stopped moving through his hair and she clutched him harder than ever. Though his nose hurt, Shinji didn't say anything.  
她的手停止了在他发间穿梭，紧紧地抱住了他，比以往任何时候都要用力。尽管鼻子疼，真嗣却什么也没说。

"I don't have any friends Shinji. I've told you that before. Most of the people I grew to care about are dead and I'm sure that's something you can understand. You're smarter than a lot of people give you credit for. Still, sometimes I think that something will happen. Something bad. I think that one day we'll go to the institution and Asuka won't be there anymore. And sometimes I think that you'll lock yourself in your room one day and you'll never come out."  
"我没有朋友，真嗣。我之前告诉过你。大多数我在乎的人都已经不在了，我相信你能理解这种感受。你比很多人认为的要聪明得多。尽管如此，有时候我会想，会有不好的事情发生。我担心有一天我们会去机构，而明日香已经不在那里了。有时候我也担心你会把自己关在房间里，再也不出来。"

She paused. 她停顿了一下。

"I hide the knives. Did you ever notice? I know it's dumb because there's tons of other ways you could do it, but every time you go to see her I always hide the knives."  
"我把刀藏起来了。你注意到过吗？我知道这很傻，因为还有很多其他方法可以做到，但每次你去见她，我总是会把刀藏起来。"

Another pause. 又一次停顿。

"But you wouldn't do that to me Shinji. I know you wouldn't, so why should I be so worried?"  
“但你不会那样对我的，真嗣。我知道你不会，那我为何还要如此担心呢？”

She finally let him go. To his credit, he only took a few steps backwards.  
她终于放开了他。值得称赞的是，他只后退了几步。

"You wouldn't do that to me, would you Shinji?"  
"你不会那样对我的，对吧，真嗣？"

"No, Misato," he didn't meet her eyes. "You know I wouldn't."  
"不，美里，""他没有直视她的眼睛。""你知道我不会的。"

"You're a good kid. I made you breakfast."  
"你是个好孩子。我给你做了早餐。"

"Thanks." "谢谢。"

"It's one of those frozen ones."  
"是那种冷冻的。"

"Hmm." "嗯。"

"The ones with those fake eggs, and the sausage and pancakes."  
"那种用假鸡蛋，还有香肠和煎饼的。"

"Oh."

"I know you like them."  
"我知道你喜欢它们。"

"Yeah. Thanks." "嗯，谢谢。"

"Eat fast or you'll be late."  
"快点吃，不然你要迟到了。"

"I know." "我知道。"

"I wish you'd let me in."  
"我希望你能让我进去。"

---

Everyone changed a bit after the incident. Nothing too major, nothing too minor. Just enough to notice and feel. Friendships felt awkward. Relationships crumbled and resurrected at random. The border of individuality was breached and things could never be the same.  
那次事件后，每个人都有些变化。不算太大，也不算太小。刚好能察觉到，能感受到。友情变得尴尬。关系时而崩溃，时而重生，毫无规律。个性的边界被突破，一切再也无法回到从前。

But everyone had to tell someone. When you realize something so undeniably true and profound you have to tell it. Though most couldn't bring themselves to tell it to the person whom it concerned, they at least told it to a close acquaintance or maybe even a stranger. It didn't really matter because it had to get out.  
但每个人都得告诉某个人。当你意识到如此不容置疑且深刻的真相时，你必须说出来。虽然大多数人无法向当事人坦白，但他们至少会告诉一个亲近的朋友，甚至可能是一个陌生人。这并不重要，因为真相必须被说出来。

Oddly enough it was Toji who was the first to ever tell Shinji. It had been an awkward and stuffy moment. The two of them hadn't seen each other since the activation of Eva Unit-03 and it was a little like walking on a tight-rope: all about the balance.  
说来奇怪，第一个告诉真嗣的人竟然是冬二。那是一个尴尬而沉闷的时刻。自从 Eva 初号机 03 启动以来，他们就没再见过面，一切都像在走钢丝：关键在于平衡。

It had been about a month since most people had come back, when they finally started classes again. They saw each other for the first time right after the bell rang for lunch. As he stood up to leave, Shinji saw Toji there sitting in the back row, meeting his eyes, smiling half-heartedly, and waving a little. Shinji thought about waving back and walking out of the room. He didn't want to push things too fast. But instead he slowed down a bit and waited for his friend to catch up with him.  
大多数人回来大约一个月后，他们终于重新开始上课。第一次见面是在午餐铃响后。当真嗣起身离开时，他看到冬二坐在后排，目光相接，半心半意地微笑着，轻轻挥手。真嗣考虑过挥手回应并走出教室。他不想推进得太快。但相反，他放慢了脚步，等待朋友赶上他。

Toji said, "Hi." 冬二说：“嗨。”

"Hi," said Shinji back. “嗨，”真嗣回应道。

And it was clear to both that this was an introduction, not a reunion. They walked together through the halls, passing groups of other loss looking students as they all scrambled about in the sea of broken cliques. As they passed the courtyard they watched in mild amusement as the students scattered themselves around the area, eating in groups of two's and three's, no longer comfortable with large masses. Shinji thought on commenting, but decided against it. It wasn't funny, or ironic. It just made sense.  
两人都明白，这是一次初识，而非重逢。他们并肩穿过走廊，经过一群群神情茫然的学生，这些学生在这片破碎的小团体海洋中四处奔走。当他们经过庭院时，看到学生们三三两两散布在各处，不再习惯于大群聚集，而是分成两人或三人的小组用餐，两人不禁微微一笑。真嗣本想评论一番，但转念一想还是作罢。这既不好笑，也不讽刺，只是理所当然。

Besides, it really didn't matter. The two of them weren't headed for the courtyard. They marched themselves single-file up the steps to the roof. Four perfectly healthy legs climbing stairs and four perfectly healthy arms holding handrails. When they reached the top, they each took a position leaning against a guardrail. Shinji with his head on his arms and his arms folded on the rail and Toji with his back to it, looking toward the stairwell. It was a while before Shinji gained the courage to talk.  
况且，这真的无关紧要。他们俩的目的地并非庭院，而是屋顶。两人一前一后地登上楼梯，四条健全的腿迈着台阶，四只健全的手紧握扶手。到达顶端后，他们各自找了个位置倚靠在护栏上：真嗣将头枕在交叠的双臂上，双臂则搭在栏杆上；而阿薰背对着栏杆，目光投向楼梯口。过了好一会儿，真嗣才鼓起勇气开口说话。

"You're not hurt…" he said sounding almost disappointed in his bewilderment. Toji glanced down at his legs and grabbed at both of his arms.  
"你没受伤……" 他带着近乎失望的困惑说道。真嗣低头看了看自己的双腿，又抓住了两只胳膊。

"Yeah, I'm good as new."  
"嗯，我完好如初。"

"But your arm… and your leg."  
"但你的手臂……还有你的腿。"

Toji shrugged. "I don't get it either. They feel just like before. Like they're the exact same… I'm not complaining."  
真嗣耸了耸肩。“我也不明白。感觉和以前一样。就像它们完全没变……我没什么可抱怨的。”

Shinji shrugged as well. It made about as much sense as Misato's missing gun wounds and Asuka's non-mangled body. All he could think of was this television special he'd seen on stem-cell research. At least the impact was good for something, right?  
真嗣也耸了耸肩。这和美里消失的枪伤以及明日香完好无损的身体一样令人费解。他唯一能想到的是之前看过的一档关于干细胞研究的电视专题。至少这次冲击还是有好处的，对吧？

"Have you seen Kensuke?" Toji asked, glancing at him from the corners of his eyes. Shinji shook his head. "Me neither. I figure he's probably still in there."  
“你看到健介了吗？”真嗣问，用眼角余光瞥了他一眼。真嗣摇了摇头。“我也没看到。我想他可能还在里面。”

"Hmm"

"You think he's coming out?" asked Toji.  
"你觉得他会出来吗？" 冬二问道。

Shinji shook his head. "I don't know."  
真嗣摇了摇头。"我不知道。"

"Yeah, but most of us did, didn't we?" No answer was given. "I think he's coming back. Yeah, I'm sure of it."  
"是啊，但我们大多数人都是这么想的，不是吗？" 没有回答。"我想他会回来的。没错，我确信。"

Shinji opted to keep quiet. He looked down over his fellow classmates sitting in the courtyard. Most of them eating quietly. Making small conversation about small insignificant things. None of them touching. Few of them laughing. All of them nervous and some of them scared. It made sense…. It all made sense.  
真嗣选择了保持沉默。他俯视着坐在庭院里的同学们。他们大多安静地吃着饭，小声谈论着无关紧要的事情。没有人触碰彼此，少数人在笑，所有人都很紧张，有些人甚至害怕。这很合理……一切都解释得通。

"It's strange, ain't it?" asked Toji. He had turned around to gaze down at them as well. "We used to all be so close, right? But when you have it all laid out for you like that… it changes things don't it."  
“很奇怪，不是吗？”托吉问道。他也转过身来，俯视着他们。“我们曾经那么亲密，对吧？但当你把一切都摊开来看……事情就变了，不是吗？”

_When you have it all laid out._ Shinji had never thought of it that way. The almost instantaneous access to knowledge of yourself. Seeing everyone as they are seen through the eyes of all and one at once. Like looking through a microscope with a magnifying glass. Is it closer or farther? Clear or cloudy? Or is everything painstakingly the same?  
当你把一切都摊开。真嗣从未这样想过。那种几乎瞬间就能了解自己的知识。同时通过所有人和一个人的眼睛看到每个人。就像透过显微镜和放大镜看东西。是更近还是更远？清晰还是模糊？或者一切都是费尽心思地相同？

"I don't remember much," said Toji.  
"我不记得太多," 说冬二。

Shinji blinked twice before saying, "Me neither."  
真嗣眨了两次眼，然后说："我也不记得。"

"But sometimes I get these impressions, ya know? Like these feelings about people who I don't even know. Or there's some things I know how to do that I don't remember learning." Toji laughed a little. "I mean it's not like I learned how to do rocket science or nothing. But I can tie a pretty good knot now. Never could before. But now I can give a woodsman a run for his money. And I know your birthday. Never knew that before either."  
"但有时候我会有些印象，你知道吗？比如对一些我根本不认识的人的感觉。或者有些事情我知道怎么做，却不记得学过。" 冬二笑了笑。"我的意思不是说我学会了做火箭科学什么的。但我现在能打一个很不错的结。以前可不行。但现在我能和一个樵夫比拼一下。而且我还知道你的生日。以前也不知道。"

Shinji shrugged, but instantly regretted it. He was afraid the action was beginning to look stupid. "I try not to think about it too much," he offered. It was the only advice he really had.  
真嗣耸了耸肩，但立刻就后悔了。他担心这个动作开始显得愚蠢。“我尽量不去多想，”他提议道。这是他真正能给出的唯一建议。

"Yeah, you're right," said Toji. "It's only the small stuff that you really remember. But it's enough isn't it? It's enough to make it hard."  
“是啊，你说得对，”托吉说。“只有那些小事你才会真正记得。但这就够了吧？足够让人感到困难了。”

They stood there for a while looking down below again. Shinji wondered if any of the people down there were having similar conversations. It was a very likely thing. The two of them stood in silence until Toji finally said the one thing that Shinji feared he'd say all along.  
他们站在那里，再次俯视下方。真嗣想知道下面的人群中是否也有人正在进行类似的对话。这很有可能。两人沉默地站着，直到托吉终于说出了真嗣一直担心他会说的话。

"I saw my mom," he said, still gazing out over the rail. "Before it all happened. She was the last thing I saw. She smiled at me and… I don't know. I remembered that smile. From like, when I was a kid. I remembered that look she gave me. She didn't say anything though. She just stood there and smiled. Then she opened her arms and I had this feeling. I… I knew things would be different. She was going to take care of things like she used to do. She was going to look after me and Mari. Heck, she was going to _cure_ the girl. She'd stay at home and always be there for us, not just come around when she felt like it the way Dad always did." Shinji watched the far off look plastered on his face with mild disbelief. He'd never known Toji to look so out of it. But as he continued to speak his expression calmed down a bit. Yet this too felt out of place.  
"我看到了我妈妈，" 他说，依旧凝视着栏杆外的远方。"在这一切发生之前。她是我最后看到的。她对我微笑，然后……我不知道。我想起了那个微笑。就像，我还是个孩子的时候。我想起了她给我的那个眼神。不过她什么也没说。她只是站在那里微笑。然后她张开双臂，我有一种感觉。我……我知道事情会不一样。她会像以前那样照顾一切。她会照顾我和真希。天哪，她会治愈那个女孩。她会待在家里，永远在我们身边，不像爸爸那样只是偶尔心血来潮才出现。" 真嗣带着些许难以置信看着他脸上遥远的表情。他从没见过阿薰如此失神。但当他继续说话时，他的表情稍微平静了一些。然而这也显得不合时宜。

"She walked towards me with her arms outstretched and I could hardly wait for her to reach me and take me up in her arms. And when she got there… I don't remember ever feeling so relieved."  
"她张开双臂向我走来，我几乎等不及她到我身边，把我拥入怀中。而当她到达那里时……我不记得有哪次感到如此宽慰。"

A silence settled over them. Toji never quite stopped staring out over the rail. But he threw little sideline glances Shinji's way as if looking for some sort of response. A minute passed. Then another. And another. And then Shinji realized what he was expected to say.  
一片沉默笼罩着他们。真嗣从未完全停止过凝视着栏杆外的远方。但他不时投来侧目，仿佛在寻找某种回应。一分钟过去了。接着又是一分钟。再一分钟。直到真嗣意识到他应该说些什么。

"Toji, I-" “真嗣，我——”

"Let's head back to the classroom."  
“我们回教室吧。”

Toji never tried to talk to him about anything too serious after that. The two ate lunch together everyday at school and even went to see some old movies they were showing at the theater on weekends. But things didn't quite feel like they used to. It helped when Kensuke came back a month or so later.  
那之后，真嗣从未试图与他谈论任何太过严肃的事情。两人每天在学校一起吃午餐，周末还会去看电影院放映的老电影。但感觉已不再是从前那样。大约一个月后，当健司回来时，情况有所好转。

Shinji didn't really know why he didn't tell Toji. It just didn't seem right at the time. If he had opened his mouth to speak, it would have felt fake and contrived. He hadn't expected Toji to just come out with it like that. He forced his hand and Shinji didn't know what cards to put down. It wasn't easy like with Hikari. And it wasn't necessary like with Misato.  
真嗣并不真正明白为什么他没有告诉真嗣。当时只是觉得不合适。如果他开口说话，会感觉虚假而牵强。他没想到真嗣会那样直接说出来。他迫使真嗣摊牌，而真嗣不知道该出什么牌。与光不同，这并不容易。与美里也不同，这并非必要。

Misato was the first person he told. She was also the only person he told everything. He told her about Asuka's mangled Eva in gory detail. And he told her about the feelings of pure terror and rage. The fear was important. To know how little of a grip he had on things once she was finally gone. He didn't hold back a thing from Misato. He couldn't really. He owed her too much. He robbed her of the sight.  
美里是他第一个倾诉的人。她也是唯一一个他毫无保留倾诉一切的人。他向她详细描述了明日香破损的 EVA，以及那种纯粹的恐惧和愤怒的感受。恐惧很重要，让他明白在她最终离去后，自己对事情的掌控是多么微弱。他对美里毫无保留，他无法真正隐瞒。他欠她太多。他剥夺了她的视线。

He felt genuine guilt for the fact that she didn't have an opportunity to see anyone in her final moments. She was already unconscious. Already gone. And he was the one to blame for that. Because of him she'd never have the knowledge, the absolute certainty, of who was the most important person in her world.  
他因她在生命最后时刻无法见到任何人而感到真切的愧疚。她已陷入昏迷，已然离去。这一切都怪他。因为他的缘故，她永远无法知晓，无法确信谁是她世界里最重要的人。

"I would have seen you," she had said and he thought it was honestly the nicest thing anyone had ever said to him. He could tell by the tone of her voice and that soft genuine embrace that she really wanted to believe it was true. He wanted to believe it too, but sometimes it was harder to buy than others. The two of them felt really close after she said that. Probably closer than they had ever been before.  
“我会来看你的。”她曾这样说，他觉得这是他听过的最暖心的话。从她的语气和那温柔真挚的拥抱中，他能感受到她是真心希望这是真的。他也想相信，但有时这比其他事情更难接受。她说了那番话后，两人的关系似乎比以往任何时候都更亲近了。可能比以往任何时候都更亲近。

They told each other horrible secrets, things better left unsaid. Each of them spilling their guts for minutes and hours until the words refused to flow. The other would listen intently and try to pretend that their problems were just as important as their own. They would offer words of comfort and the occasional hug or light touch. And sometimes, when things got really desperate, they'd give a shoulder to cry on.  
他们向对方吐露了可怕的秘密，那些本不该说出口的事情。他们倾诉了数分钟乃至数小时，直到言语不再流畅。另一方则会专注聆听，试图假装他们的问题同样重要。他们会给予安慰的话语，偶尔拥抱或轻触。而有时，当情况变得非常绝望时，他们会提供一个可以依靠哭泣的肩膀。

Shinji told her of the confusion and the loneliness, before all the other people started to come back. About watching Asuka's mind slowly waste away. Misato told him of times long past. Of late night cram sessions with Ritsuko and random dates with Kaji. About the disaster of the second impact and horrors of NERV. And worst of all, the times in-between. The loneliness of the post-collegiate days. Of nights spent alone in a messy apartment drinking herself to sleep. No one wanted to hire a combat strategist in times of peace. No matter how gifted or talented she was said to be. But she busied herself entertaining guests. In one door and out the other. A night's comfort traded for a morning worth of regrets. And even though she never took them seriously, she always wondered why none of them ever seemed to want to stay.  
真嗣向她倾诉了在其他人归来之前的困惑与孤独，以及目睹明日香心智逐渐消逝的痛苦。美里则向他讲述了久远的往事，那些与律子通宵备考的夜晚，与加持的随意约会，还有第二次冲击的灾难和 NERV 的恐怖。而最糟糕的，是那些夹缝中的时光，大学毕业后独自一人的孤寂，在凌乱的公寓中独酌至眠的夜晚。和平时期，无人愿聘一位战斗策略家，无论她被赞誉多么有天赋。但她忙于招待来客，进进出出，一夜慰藉换来清晨的悔恨。尽管她从未认真对待，却总疑惑为何他们无一愿留下。

She told Shinji these things and he was always listening. He was always there. And at some point, he stopped finding horrible things to tell her back. So he listened carefully and never interrupted. And whenever she looked at him he watched in amazement as her face transformed into something like love. The more terrible things she said the more he could see that she loved him. And the more she seemed to drink, the more things she was willing to freely share.  
她把这些事告诉了真嗣，而他总是倾听着。他总是在那里。不知何时起，他不再找些可怕的事情来回应她。于是他仔细聆听，从不打断。每当她看向他时，他都惊奇地看着她的脸庞转变成一种类似爱的表情。她说的越可怕，他就越能感受到她对他的爱。而她似乎喝得越多，就越愿意自由地分享心事。

That's what ended it really. She was just drunk enough for the alcohol to be an excuse, but not quite enough for either of them to dismiss it as nonsense.  
真正结束这一切的，就是那次。她喝得恰到好处，酒精成了借口，但又不至于让他们中的任何一个将其视为胡言乱语。

"I feel so alone," she said and she held onto him tight. "I'm so glad you're here. I don't think I could have taken it if it were Asuka and not you."  
“我感觉如此孤单，”她说着，紧紧抱住他，“很高兴你在这里。如果是明日香而不是你，我想我无法承受。”

He broke away from her then and they both looked each other square in the eyes. Both their faces showed shock, but only Misato's showed fear.  
他随即挣脱了她的手，两人直视着对方的眼睛。他们的脸上都显露出震惊，但只有美里露出了恐惧。

"I'm sorry," she said and Shinji just stared at her and stared at her and stared.  
“对不起，”她说道，而真嗣只是盯着她，盯着她，一直盯着。

"That came out all wrong," she said and it hurt how much he wanted to believe her.  
“我说错了，”她解释道，而他多么希望自己能相信她，这种渴望让他感到心痛。

He said, "it's okay," but of course it wasn't.  
他说：“没事的。”但当然并非如此。

She stopped drinking a few days later, but things were never quite the same.  
她几天后就不再喝酒了，但一切再也回不到从前。

That's probably why he liked Hikari so much. She was if nothing else consistent.  
这大概就是他为什么那么喜欢光的原因吧。她即便有缺点，也始终如一。

There is something to be said about the way she worked her peers. It was something more than the appearance of authority granted her by her position. And while many people, lost as they were in their own particular hang ups, clung to the unwavering dictation that naturally comes along with a working system, her appeal stretched beyond that as well. Understanding was the key. When people talked, Hikari listened. She nodded in all the right places, smiled when necessary, and dealt out her fair share of comfort as well. The way she read their needs was astounding.  
关于她如何与同事相处，确实有值得称道之处。这不仅仅是职位赋予她的权威外表，更在于她能超越工作体系自然而然的刻板指令。许多人深陷于各自的困扰，紧抓着这些不变的规则，而她的魅力却远不止于此。理解是关键。当人们倾诉时，光倾听着。她在恰当的时刻点头，必要时微笑，也适时给予安慰。她洞察他人需求的能力令人惊叹。

Take Kensuke, for instance. The impact hadn't been very kind to him at all. His confidence was shaken and his dreams were shattered. For a while it had been a sad thing to watch. Though he was far from broken, it was easy to see his evident confusion. When he took to hanging out with Shinji and Toji, both of them could tell that the fire seemed to be gone. A person like Kensuke needed passion. They searched desperately for something to idolize, something to aspire to. For him it had been piloting the Eva, and the impact had roughly swept that dream away. The answer to this problem was simpler than expected. Hikari just gave him an assignment. She asked him quite nicely to do a small cinematic diary of the classes last year in junior high. Kensuke liked to film things. It was as simple as that. A fire rekindled.  
以真嗣为例，冲击对他可一点也不仁慈。他的自信动摇了，梦想也破碎了。有一段时间，看着他那副模样实在令人心酸。尽管他远未崩溃，但他的明显困惑显而易见。当他开始与真治和渡志混在一起时，两人都能察觉到他似乎失去了往日的激情。像真嗣这样的人需要热情。他们拼命寻找着可以崇拜、可以追求的东西。对他来说，驾驶 EVA 曾是那个梦想，而冲击却粗暴地将其夺走。解决这个问题比预想的要简单。光只是给了他一个任务。她非常友好地请他制作一份去年初中课程的小型电影日记。真嗣喜欢拍摄东西。就这么简单。激情重燃了。

Hikari's seemingly miraculous empathy skills were tempered by restraint. She knew not to overdo it. It wasn't important to make friends. Most of the people who needed her services already had enough trouble trying to communicate with the friends they did have. The trick was to simply be there when needed and absent when not. She held her cards close to her chest, and only played on the winning hands.  
光的能力看似奇迹般的同理心技巧，实则蕴含着克制。她深知不可过犹不及。交朋友并非首要之事。大多数需要她服务的人，本就与现有的朋友沟通困难重重。关键在于，需要时在场，无需时则退。她紧握底牌，只在胜券在握时才出手。

The 7th grade girls she ate lunch with on the other hand might as well be wearing mirrored glasses. They all sat in the grass in a circular pattern, gossiping among each other in conspiratorial whispers. They put up a strong front for the people around them, but they were probably the people who required Hikari's help the most. There wasn't a single one of them who had not privately approached the girl with some secret problem or another. Shinji knew from Hikari's minor confidences that underneath it all these girls where probably more fragile than anyone. Yet even with that knowledge and his two-year age advantage Shinji was afraid to approach the group.  
另一方面，她那些七年级的女同学们，简直就像戴着墨镜一样难以看透。她们围坐在草地上，形成一个圆圈，窃窃私语地八卦着。她们对外人展现出坚强的外表，但实际上，可能是最需要光帮助的人。她们中没有一个没私下找过光，倾诉各种秘密烦恼。从光偶尔透露的点滴中，真嗣知道这些女孩内心可能比任何人都脆弱。然而，即便了解这一点，加上自己比她们大两岁的优势，真嗣仍不敢接近她们。

They had a sort of routine. He slowly shuffled himself into a position behind Hikari. Each time he knew that he should say or do something to alert her to his presence, yet each time he opted not to. Eyes would be drawn in his direction, conversation would abruptly cease, the world stopped spinning upon its axis, and Hikari would finally turn around to see his somewhat downcast face.  
他们有一种固定的模式。他缓缓地挪动自己，站到光的后方。每次他都知道应该说点什么或做点什么来引起她的注意，但每次他都选择不说。目光会向他这边投来，谈话会突然中断，世界仿佛停止了转动，光最终转过身来，看到他那略显沮丧的脸。

"Oh, hi Shinji," she said as if five or six other girls weren't carefully analyzing every word spoken. There was a bit of a rumor going on about the two of them. A rumor that Shinji had to vehemently deny during one especially awkward conversation with Toji and a spectator Kensuke.  
“哦，嗨，真嗣，”她说话时仿佛周围没有五六个女孩在仔细分析每一个字。关于他们俩的流言正在传开。在一次特别尴尬的对话中，真嗣不得不强烈否认与阿薰和旁观的剑介之间的传闻。

"Hey," Shinji said as if he was being watched by a football stadium full of people on free hat night. Everyone present found it odd how he tried to direct his greeting toward the entire group. He stared at the ground next to her legs and hoped that no one noticed him chewing on the inside of his mouth. "Are you… busy or anything?"  
“嘿，”真嗣回应道，仿佛被一个免费帽子之夜的足球场观众盯着。在场的人都觉得奇怪，他试图把问候转向整个群体。他盯着她腿边的地面，希望没人注意到他在咬嘴唇内侧。“你……忙吗？”

Luckily for Shinji, there was no audible laughter and his head was at just the right angle to miss all the smiles and smirks.  
幸运的是，对于真嗣来说，没有听到笑声，而且他的头正好处于一个角度，错过了所有的微笑和窃笑。

"No, I'm not busy." “不，我不忙。”

"Can we talk for a bit… if that's okay." Again, awkwardly addressing everyone.  
“我们可以聊一会儿吗……如果可以的话。”他又尴尬地对所有人说道。

Hikari dished out a few apologetic glances before rising to her feet.  
光里投去几个歉意的眼神，然后站起身来。

"Sure Shinji… we can talk."  
“当然，真嗣……我们可以谈谈。”

---

They took their seats beneath the roof overhanging and leaned their backs up against the wall. Shinji opted to fold his legs under himself while Hikari kept her legs outstretched, no bend in the knees at all. It wasn't particularly comfortable sitting on the hard blacktop as opposed to the grassy area where they could still see most students eating their lunches. But do to the overhanging there was quite a bit of shade and with it came a perceived sense of privacy. Though they were clearly visible to anyone sitting in the courtyard the line of shadow cast upon the ground served as a mental barrier between them and those who ate out in the sun.  
他们在屋檐下的座位上坐下，背靠墙壁。真嗣选择将双腿盘起，而光里则保持双腿伸直，膝盖一点弯曲都没有。坐在坚硬的黑石路面上，比起能看到大多数学生吃午餐的草地，确实不那么舒适。但由于屋檐的遮挡，这里有不少阴凉，随之而来的是一种被保护的错觉。尽管他们明显可见于庭院中的任何人，但地面上投下的阴影线条在心理上形成了一道屏障，将他们与阳光下用餐的人隔开。

For a while Shinji merely sat there staring at the weeds cracking through the asphalt. He knew that Hikari was staring at him because he could feel her gaze on his face. He knew that when he looked over to meat her eyes, he would see that subtle anxiety of anticipation plastered throughout her expression. Because Shinji Ikari did not invite Hikari Horaki into the secluded shade to 'hang out'. He was merely there to get away.  
有好一会儿，真嗣只是坐在那里，盯着那些穿透柏油的杂草。他知道光在盯着他，因为他能感觉到她的目光落在他的脸上。他知道，当他转过头去看她的眼睛时，会看到她脸上那细微的期待焦虑。因为碇真嗣并没有邀请铆钉明日香进入这片隐蔽的树荫下‘闲逛’。他只是在那里逃避。

"She had another episode," he said as he turned his head slightly to the side. Through the corner of his left eye he could see her hand reach toward her mouth. It warmed something inside of him to see her react so purely.  
“她又发作了，”他微微侧过头说。透过左眼的余光，他看到她的手伸向嘴边。看到她如此纯粹的反应，他内心感到一丝温暖。

"Is she alright?" asked Hikari. There was naked worry in her tone. Shinji found the way she worried to be a refreshing change from his guardian's. Misato knew nothing of restraint, tending toward the extremes. When she worried about something she either leaned toward unsatisfying dismissal, or near total desperation. But Hikari had it down just right. There was just enough fear present to let you know that she cared, but she never made him feel as if his words or actions could break her. Her concern was a thing of beauty. In fact, if Shinji had to choose one person (and one person only) to cause worry to for the rest of his life, it would most certainly be Hikari.  
"她还好吗？" 光问道，语气中流露出明显的担忧。真嗣发现她这种担忧与他监护人截然不同，令人耳目一新。美里毫无节制，总是走向极端。她担心某事时，要么轻描淡写地打发，要么近乎绝望。但光却恰到好处。她的担忧恰如其分，让你知道她在乎，却从不会让你觉得自己的言行会让她崩溃。她的关心是一种美。事实上，如果真嗣必须选择一个人（且仅此一人）来让他担忧一生，那无疑会是光。

"She's okay," he said feeling both awkward and strangely energized by the attention he was receiving from the girl. He turned his head farther to more clearly see the relief as it washed over her face. "It was just a minor seizure this time. Not nearly as bad as the last one."  
"她没事，" 他说，既感到尴尬又因女孩的关注而莫名振奋。他转过头，更清楚地看到她脸上流露出的宽慰。"这次只是轻微的癫痫发作，远没有上次那么严重。"

"Thank God," said the girl and she leaned back up against the wall, her body relaxing for the first time. Shinji watched as she breathed softly for several moments, letting the realization that her one-time friend's life was again endangered and again spared sink in. Sometimes Shinji feels guilty for the emotional roller coaster he puts her through, even if she almost begged him for it at first. But guilt didn't bother him as much as it used to. It was relatively easy to ignore… usually.  
"感谢上帝，" 女孩说道，她靠回墙上，身体第一次放松下来。真嗣看着她轻轻呼吸了几下，让她意识到她曾经的朋友的生命再次陷入危险，又再次被拯救的事实慢慢沉淀。有时，真嗣会为自己给她带来的情感起伏感到内疚，尽管她最初几乎是在恳求他这样做。但内疚感不再像以前那样困扰他了。相对而言，它很容易被忽视……通常是这样。

"Why does this keep happening?" she asked and Shinji mildly cringed. "Didn't they say the seizures would stop?"  
"为什么这种情况一再发生？" 她问道，真嗣微微皱眉。"他们不是说癫痫会停止吗？"

Only a handful of people exist that Hikari would be willing to share that sort of desperation with. There was a reason she was staring at him so openly and expectantly. As irrational as it may be, she somehow knew that he would not let her down. He would not leave her there feeling sad and depressed over the state of her friend, because that was just something Shinji was incapable of. Hikari trusted him to cut the dosage of desperation with a healthy portion of hope. And with her limited knowledge kept to a minimum by her non-connection to NERV, she had no way of knowing just how heavily her hope was laced with delusion.  
只有少数几个人能让光愿意分享那种绝望。她如此直白而期待地盯着他，是有原因的。尽管这可能不合逻辑，但她不知怎的就是知道，他不会让她失望。他不会让她在那里因为朋友的情况而感到悲伤和沮丧，因为那正是真嗣所做不到的。光相信他会用一份健康的希望来稀释那份绝望。而由于她与 NERV 毫无关联，所知有限，她无从知晓自己的希望究竟有多么深地掺杂着妄想。

His voice was even enough when he said, "The doctors say they're very close to figuring out what's wrong with her."  
他的声音平稳，说道：“医生们说，他们很快就能找出她的问题所在了。”

"That's what they said before."  
“他们之前也是这么说的。”

Though he suddenly felt the desire to cough into his hands, Shinji resisted and said, "But this time they're almost positive."  
"尽管他突然感到想用手捂嘴咳嗽，但真嗣忍住了，说道：“但这次他们几乎可以肯定。””

"Really?" “真的吗？”

Only minor hesitation then, "Really."  
"只是略微迟疑了一下，“真的吗？””

Hikari's face lifted. This time the cough couldn't be contained.  
"光的脸抬了起来。这次咳嗽再也忍不住了。

"They say her health is really improving. And… and they say that another seizure isn't very likely at all."  
"他们说她健康状况真的在好转。而且……而且他们说再次发作的可能性非常小。"

"That's great news!" said Hikari, as Shinji subtly cleared his throat.  
"那真是太好了！" 光说，而真嗣则微妙地清了清喉咙。"

"Also she really is looking a lot more healthy." He carefully tracked the ascension of the corners of Hikiari's lips. "It's only a… a matter of time before she can come home again."  
"而且她看起来确实健康多了。" 他仔细观察着光嘴角的上扬。"只是时间问题，她很快就能回家了。"

"It's about time!" said Hikari letting out a surprisingly airy giggle. She covered her mouth quickly as if shamed by the sounds escaping her. And despite himself, Shinji couldn't help but twitch his lips into the barest of smiles. But the girl recovered quickly. "Does this mean I can go see her soon?"  
"终于等到这一天了！" 光子发出了一声意外轻盈的笑声。她迅速捂住嘴，仿佛为自己的声音感到羞愧。尽管如此，真嗣还是忍不住微微扬起了嘴角。但女孩很快恢复了常态。"这是不是意味着我很快就能去看她了？"

The mirth left her features as she witnessed the rapid death of Shinji's smile.  
看到真嗣的笑容迅速消失，她的喜悦也随之消散。

"Well… they still aren't allowing regular visitors… it's just… NERV policy and all… sorry."  
"嗯……他们还是不允许普通访客……只是……这是 NERV 的规定……抱歉。"

Hikari conjured up her best 'no big deal face'.  
光里摆出了她最拿手的‘没什么大不了’的表情。

"It's okay. I understand. They have rules."  
“没关系。我理解。他们有规定。”

"Yeah…" said Shinji. He was beginning to find the asphalt interesting again. But then an idea struck.  
“是啊……”真嗣说道。他开始再次觉得沥青路面颇有趣味。但随即一个念头闪过。

"You know, she asked about you the last time I visited."  
"你知道吗，上次我去看她时，她还问起你呢。"

Hikari looked momentarily puzzled before asking, "Did she?"  
光看起来一时有些困惑，随后问道：“是吗？”

He reflexively nodded his head. "She wanted to know how you're doing." The look of puzzlement persisted. "She seemed… interested."  
他下意识地点了点头。“她想知道你最近怎么样。”困惑的表情依旧挂在脸上。“她似乎……很关心。”

Finally Hikari's smile returned and Shinji felt like he had just then begun to breathe again.  
终于，光的脸庞上再次绽放了笑容，真嗣感觉自己仿佛刚刚才开始重新呼吸。

"Next time you see her, tell her I'm doing just fine and that she should try and get healthy as soon as possible."  
下次见到她时，告诉她我一切都好，让她尽快恢复健康。

Again Shinji was forced to smile. He said, "Sure."  
真嗣再次被迫微笑，他说：“当然。”

And just like that, whatever spell that magically allowed him to calmly and rationally interface with a girl came abruptly to an end. Both of them discretely looked away and the two of them felt a mutual air of finality.  
就这样，那个神奇地让他能够冷静理性地与女孩交流的魔法突然结束了。两人都默契地移开了视线，彼此间弥漫着一种终结的氛围。

"Well…" said Hikari placing her hands on the ground in an effort to stand up. "I guess I better get back to my friends. Who knows what they're saying about me while I'm gone?"  
“嗯……”光把手放在地上，试图站起来，“我想我该回到朋友们那里了。谁知道他们在我不在的时候会说我什么呢？”

Shinji couldn't contain a blush as he rose to his feet. "I should get back to Toji and Kensuke too, I guess. I just wanted to make sure you knew what was happening… didn't want to leave you in the dark or anything."  
真嗣站起身时，脸颊不由自主地泛起了红晕。“我也该回到东治和健介那里了，我想。我只是想确保你知道发生了什么……不想让你蒙在鼓里或者别的什么。”

He watched Hikari's face carefully as she cast her eyes to either side of her vision. Despite confirming her semi-fear that someone was watching them, she took a small shy step forward. And though he knew it was coming (he'd even come to expect it) Shinji took a sharp intake of breath as her arms circled around his back. It wasn't like Misato's hugs. There was no sense of need. Nor was it desperate like the hug he had received from The Girl. It was merely a light showing of affection, a token of appreciation. And somehow, despite the small nagging of guilt, his face was forced into another small smile. It grew into a silly half embarrassed grin when she said with her mouth right next to his ear, "Thank you."  
他仔细观察着光的脸，只见她目光左右游移。尽管证实了她半信半疑的担忧——有人在监视他们，她还是怯生生地向前迈了一小步。虽然他早有预料（甚至已习以为常），但当她的手臂环抱住他的后背时，真嗣还是不由自主地深吸了一口气。这不像美里那种拥抱，没有那种迫切的需求感；也不像他曾从那个女孩那里得到的拥抱那样绝望。这只是一个轻柔的示意，一种感激的表示。尽管内心隐隐有些愧疚，他的脸上还是不由自主地露出了微笑。当她凑近他的耳边轻声说“谢谢你”时，这微笑变成了半是尴尬半是傻气的咧嘴笑。

Because everyone needs an escape sometimes.  
因为有时候，每个人都得找个出口。

**AN:** This is a bit of a set-up chapter, I know. It seems that with all the development necessary to put this whole story together, I am going to have to write a few more chapters than I had previous thought. Expect more plot and more explanations within the next chapter. Yes… I know that both microscopes and magnifying glasses magnify… but I couldn't think of anything that's meant to make things look further away, and I really liked the potential of that analogy. Sorry for the long long production time for such a short chapter… I had writers block like nobodies business.  
作者注：我知道这有点铺垫chapter。看来为了把整个故事串联起来，需要的发展环节不少，我得比原先预想的再多写几章。期待接下来的chapter会有更多情节和解释。是的……我知道显微镜和放大镜都能放大物体……但我就是想不出有什么东西是用来让事物看起来更远的，而我真的很喜欢那个比喻的潜力。对于这么短的chapter花了这么长时间来创作，真的很抱歉……我遭遇了前所未有的写作障碍。

Can't believe I forgot to mention this: Thanks to The Blair for pre-reading.  
真不敢相信我忘了提这个：感谢 The Blair 的预读。

### Chapter 4

**A/N:** Here's another one. I know I haven't posted anything in a while, but it wasn't because I wasn't writing… well not completely because I wasn't writing. I was also working on my side project that I won't be posting until it's completed, so expect my posts to be slower. Yeah I know… you thought they couldn't get any slower… but they can. Enjoy!  
作者笔记：又一篇来了。我知道我有一阵子没更新了，但这并非因为我没在写……好吧，不完全是因为我没在写。我还在忙一个不会发布直到完成的副项目，所以我的更新速度会慢些。是的，我知道……你们以为已经够慢了……但还能更慢。尽情享受吧！

Dr. Komatsu presented himself as my willing guide to the system. Patience is the key, he says and these are the words he lives by. It's not a matter of cramming info or forcing progress. It's mostly a process of waiting. Waiting and accepting. Though some days I want to pull out my hair. I want to yell at the top of my lungs and say "this isn't working" or "that isn't true" but instead I wait. I breathe deeply, nod my head, and I tell Dr. Komatsu what is wrong in a clam and careful mater as the words burn me up inside. It's always painful, and it's always terribly slow. But when I talk to my doctor, my ambassador to reality, I feel it slowly ebb away. I remember that it's all an ends to a means.
小松博士自荐成为我探索系统的向导。耐心是关键，他如是说，这也是他生活的信条。这并非关于填鸭式灌输信息或强行推进进度。它主要是一个等待和接受的过程。尽管有些日子我想扯掉我的头发。我想放声大喊“这行不通”或“那不是真的”，但我选择等待。我深呼吸，点头，并以平静而谨慎的方式告诉小松博士哪里出了问题，尽管这些话在我内心燃烧。这总是痛苦的，而且总是极其缓慢。但当我与我的医生，现实中的使者交谈时，我感到它慢慢消退。我记得这一切都是为了达到目的。

The system is designed to make me a person. I've been assured time and time again that the system has been successful. Those who are willing to follow it can be whole. Though I have my grievances with it, I've grown to respect it as well. The system hurts but the system works. And in time I'll finally be who they want me to be.
这个系统旨在让我成为一个完整的人。我一再被保证，这个系统是成功的。那些愿意遵循它的人可以变得完整。尽管我对它有所不满，我也逐渐对它产生了敬意。这个系统虽痛苦，但它有效。随着时间的推移，我终将成为他们希望我成为的人。

The timing is the key.
时机是关键。

No one can believe you when you're yelling wildly one moment, then claiming to be a person the next. There is no switch you can hit that will take you from being lost to being found. They humored me at first. Their words were soft and mocking. They asked me question after question. Analyzing and scrutinizing every word in every sentence.
当你上一刻还在狂野地咆哮，下一刻却声称自己是另一个人时，没有人会相信你。没有哪个开关能让你从迷失切换到被找到。起初他们只是迁就我。他们的言辞柔和而带有嘲讽。他们一个问题接一个问题地问我。分析并审视每一句话中的每一个字。

"I am Asuka Langley Soryu", I said. And they would write on their notepads and scrunch up their brows and make small little noises in their throats. They could see me so easily through my mask made of glass. They each took turns shattering it with ease. Because as much as I knew, and as hard as I tried, I could not be her. And in the end it always came down to the same thing: me begging and pleading. A weak shell of need, crying uselessly on the floor.
“我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷”，我说道。他们会记在笔记本上，皱起眉头，喉咙里发出细微的声响。他们轻易地透过我那由玻璃制成的面具看穿我。他们轮流轻松地将其击碎。因为无论我多么了解，多么努力尝试，我都无法成为她。最终，这一切总是归结为同一件事：我乞求和恳求。一个脆弱的需求外壳，无力地在地板上哭泣。

They told me that a change is internal. You have to want it on the inside. You have to want it for yourself. "We cannot make you change" they told me. "We can only help you along". And for all their talk, I still didn't understand.
他们告诉我，改变是内在的。你必须内心渴望它。你必须为自己想要它。“我们不能让你改变”，他们告诉我。“我们只能帮助你前进”。尽管他们说了这么多，我仍然不明白。

It wasn't until I sat down with Dr. Komatsu and really really listened, that I began to understand. The old man was the last person to believe my lies, so he was the first one I told the truth. I told him, "I don't want to be here anymore". I told him "I need to be where Asuka is." And he nodded and nodded for an eternity. I told him how she needed me. How I took care of her, and how nice it was to be the mother. Because the mother can be hard, and the mother can be soft, but the mother should always always care. I explained to him, in no uncertain terms, that the child needs the mother. Because who else can decide what's best for them? Who else has the right to decide how they live?
直到我坐下来与小松博士真正倾听时，我才开始理解。这位老人是最后一个相信我谎言的人，因此也是我第一个吐露真相的人。我告诉他，“我不想再待在这里了”。我说，“我需要去到明日香身边。”他点头再点头，仿佛时间凝固。我告诉他她需要我，我如何照顾她，以及作为母亲是多么美好。因为母亲可以坚强，也可以温柔，但母亲应该始终关心。我明确无误地向他解释，孩子需要母亲。因为还有谁能决定什么对他们最好？还有谁能有权决定他们如何生活？

And he nodded and nodded and nodded, and wrote and wrote and wrote as the words poured out like blood shed anew. I told him of my confusion. Why I didn't understand what was required of me, how I couldn't understand why they wouldn't believe me. I explained to him that I was willing to be Asuka for them if they wanted me to and that was when he finally spoke.
他点头再点头，笔下不停，字字句句如新流之血。我向他倾诉我的困惑。为何我不明白自己的职责所在，为何他们不相信我。我向他说明，如果他们希望，我愿意成为他们的明日香，就在那时，他终于开口了。

The doctor told me something I'd have never expected to hear: They didn't want me to be Asuka at all. At least not the Asuka I was familiar with. They wanted me to simply be myself. But at the same time they thought that I should recognize Asuka. That I should try to come to grips with her past and understand her. It was a bizarre concept to me at first, but I slowly began to work with it.
医生告诉我一些我从未预料到的话：他们根本不希望我成为明日香，至少不是我所熟悉的那位明日香。他们希望我简单地做回自己。但同时，他们认为我应该认识明日香，应该努力去理解她的过去。起初，这个概念对我来说很奇怪，但我慢慢开始接受并实践它。

The first step was in finding my name. They insisted that I be called Asuka. I wanted to argue and disagree, but I could tell they were not going to budge on that point. Dr. Komatsu explained that it was okay if I didn't feel like Asuka or even if I didn't act like her. It was fine for now to just be Asuka in name. Everything else would come later.
第一步是找到我的名字。他们坚持要我被称为明日香。我想争辩和反对，但我看得出他们在这个问题上不会让步。小松医生解释说，即使我感觉不像明日香，或者行为不像她，仅仅在名义上成为明日香也是可以的。其他的一切可以稍后再说。

The doctor and I began to have daily sessions. He would ask me questions about her life and I would answer to the best of my ability. I tried to explain to him her motivation and her reasons for living the way she did, but sometimes it was harder than others. The information was so personal... I felt like I was betraying her in some ways. But I continued to tell the doctor as much as I could because he assured me that it would help me become whole.
医生和我开始每天进行会谈。他会问我关于她生活的问题，我会尽我所能回答。我试图向他解释她的动机和她那样生活的原因，但有时这比其他时候更难。这些信息太私人了……我觉得在某种程度上我背叛了她。但我继续尽可能多地告诉医生，因为他向我保证这会帮助我变得完整。

Sometimes the doctor would ask me about myself. About the things I liked to do, the things that made me sad or happy. Even about minor things like my favorite color or what foods I liked to eat the most. I had a hard time answering these questions because they were things I'd never given much thought to. It frustrated me when I couldn't give Dr. Komatsu an answer because it felt like failure. And I'm not fond of failure. The doctor was always kind and patient when this happened, but a part of me could always tell that I'd somehow let him down. So when I couldn't think of a proper answer, I said whatever Asuka would say. It made things easier that way.
有时医生会问我关于自己的事情。关于我喜欢做的事，让我悲伤或快乐的事情。甚至是一些琐碎的问题，比如我最喜欢的颜色或我最喜欢吃什么食物。我很难回答这些问题，因为它们是我从未深思过的。当我无法给小松医生一个答案时，我会感到沮丧，因为那感觉像是失败。而我并不喜欢失败。医生总是很友善和耐心，但我知道我总会在某种程度上让他失望。所以当我无法想出一个合适的答案时，我会说绫波会说的那些话。这样事情会变得简单些。

In a few weeks time they'd begun to trust me again. They only locked my room at night and I was allowed to mix freely with the other patients. They even said I could have visitors again... but I declined. I had embarrassed myself with Shinji in ways that I really don't want to think about. Seeing him then would have felt indecent. I no longer blamed him for what happened, but I didn't want him to see me like this. He would have to wait until I was stable and certain. And maybe then he would forgive me.
几周后，他们又开始信任我了。他们只在晚上锁上我的房间，我被允许与其他病人自由交往。他们甚至说我可以再次接待访客...但我拒绝了。我在真嗣面前出尽了洋相，那些我不想再去回想的事情。那时见他会让我感到不体面。我不再为发生的事情责怪他，但我不希望他看到我这样。他得等到我稳定且确定的时候。也许到那时他会原谅我。

I have to admit that it was kind of lonely without his frequent visits. He used to come to see us often and it really brightened up the day. I didn't spend all my time moping and feeling lonesome though. I frequently talked to the nurses and orderlies when I got bored. And there was always Dr. Komatsu to talk to as well. I even spoke with some of the other residents of the hospital, though not very often.
我不得不承认，没有他频繁的探访，确实有些孤单。他过去常来看我们，真的让日子变得明朗起来。不过，我并没有把所有时间都花在闷闷不乐和感到孤独上。无聊时，我经常和护士及护工聊天。还有 Komatsu 医生也可以聊聊。我甚至和医院里的一些其他居民交谈过，虽然不常。

I made one friend among the other patients. His name is Takashi and he's a ghost. He's much older than me and often quiet to the point of being easily ignored. I like talking to him sometimes because I feel odd when I don't talk to people often and because it makes him smile. His smiles are genuine and they're only for me. Since Takashi doesn't move much, sometimes I move for him. He opens his mouth for the nurses to feed him, but he does it a lot faster for me. I know he wants to make me happy and I take some small comfort in that. I show him kindness because I know it's what he wants to see. Takashi doesn't know what I want at all, but I don't hold it against him.
我在其他病人中交了一个朋友。他叫 Takashi，是个幽灵。他比我大很多，常常安静到容易被忽视。我喜欢偶尔和他聊天，因为我不常与人交谈时会感到奇怪，而且这让他微笑。他的微笑是真诚的，只为我而绽放。因为 Takashi 不太动，有时我替他动。他张嘴让护士喂食，但对我来说，他吃得更快。我知道他想让我开心，这让我感到些许安慰。我对他展现善意，因为我知道这是他想看到的。Takashi 完全不知道我想要什么，但我并不怪他。

We aren't very alike, but we do have one thing in common: we both think I'm someone else. I told this joke to Dr. Komatsu but he didn't laugh. He asked me to explain what I meant. I told him that if you have to explain a joke, then it wasn't worth telling. I could tell he didn't like that, but he left the issue alone. He's just afraid to discourage me because he's glad I've made a friend.
我们并不十分相似，但我们有一点相同：我们都以为我是另一个人。我曾把这个笑话讲给小松博士听，但他没有笑。他让我解释是什么意思。我告诉他，如果一个笑话需要解释，那就不值得讲。我能看出他对此不太高兴，但他没有再纠缠这个问题。他只是害怕打击我，因为他很高兴我交到了朋友。

The nurses are also happy to see me with Takashi. They say he's much easier to handle when I'm around. He eats properly, takes his pills, and sometimes goes to the bathroom by himself if I walk him to the door. He will walk with me anywhere as long as I hold his hand. Sometimes it's hard to convince him to let go. When we talk he's very attentive. He watches my face with an intensity that the doctors and nurses all find remarkable. It's a stark contrast to the slack expression he displays when I'm not around. But like most men, he hears but doesn't listen. When I'm done talking, he'll take his wrinkly hand and place it on mine. He looks me in the eye and calls out gently, "Sakura." I try not to blush, but there's something in his voice when he says it. In that way and that way only, he reminds me of Shinji. Otherwise there is no resemblance.
护士们也很高兴看到我和高志在一起。她们说有我在的时候，他变得容易照顾多了。他会好好吃饭，按时吃药，有时我带他到门口，他还能自己去洗手间。只要我牵着他的手，他愿意跟我去任何地方。有时候，让他放手还真不容易。我们交谈时，他非常专注。他凝视我的脸庞，那种专注程度让医生和护士们都感到惊讶。这与我不在时他那副无精打采的表情形成了鲜明对比。但和大多数男人一样，他听而不闻。我讲完后，他会用他那布满皱纹的手覆盖在我的手上。他直视我的眼睛，温柔地唤道：“樱。”我尽量不脸红，但他说出这个名字时，声音里有些东西让我心动。唯有这种方式，他让我想起了真嗣。除此之外，他们毫无相似之处。

The orderlies call him Casper because he walks through walls at night. He sleeps in a room with three other men around the same age. Their door is locked firmly from the outside, just as mine is. Yet some nights I hear him there knocking at my door. He calls out to me softly and often he's crying. I talk to him through the walls to calm him down. I try my best to be his Sakura when he needs me to. It usually isn't long before someone comes to lead him back to bed.
护工们叫他卡斯珀，因为他夜里能穿墙而过。他和另外三个同龄男子同住一间房。他们的门也像我的房间一样，从外面牢牢锁住。然而有些夜晚，我能听到他在那儿敲我的门。他轻声呼唤我，常常带着哭腔。我隔着墙与他交谈，尽力安抚他。在他需要时，我努力成为他的樱。通常不久后，就会有人来把他带回床上。

Sometimes when the nurses are busy I sit with him as Sakura would. I place my arm around his waist and lean my head on his shoulder and talk to him sweetly. I ask him how he's feeling or what he's thinking about. Rarely does he answer… at least not in complete sentences. He has his good days and his bad days, just like all of us. Occasionally his responses are just as coherent as my questions. And when I ask him how he walks through walls he looks at me with a knowing smile.
有时当护士们忙碌时，我会像樱那样陪着他。我把手臂环在他的腰间，将头靠在他的肩上，温柔地与他交谈。我会问他感觉如何，或是他在想些什么。他很少完整回答……至少不是完整的句子。他有好日子也有坏日子，就像我们所有人一样。偶尔他的回答和我提问的连贯性不相上下。当我问他如何穿墙而过时，他带着一种了然的微笑看着我。

It's hard to be so close to Takashi because a part of me feels that I shouldn't. Being Sakura isn't the same as being Asuka. It's feels hollow. Like everything inside is missing. Sakura isn't real to me. I don't know what she would be doing or what she would be thinking. I just know that when I'm her it makes Takashi happy. Being Asuka is different. It's real. I understand her in a way that I'd never understand Sakura, even if I'd met her. But being Asuka feels wrong in a different way. The things that she thinks and the things that she says are troubling. They don't match up correctly. When I'm her, I feel this heaviness weighing down on me. Like she's dragging the world behind her on her small weak shoulders. Her knees buckle under the pressure and I know she's going to fall. I'm ashamed to admit it, but sometimes I wish she would. I wish she would fall to pieces in front of me and never return. Then I could be someone like Sakura. Empty and hollow. In time, I would find a way to fill the space. And maybe then, I could be as close to Shinji as Sakura is to Takashi. But I know that's just a dream.
离 Takashi 太近让我感到困难，因为内心的一部分觉得我不应该这样。作为 Sakura 和作为 Asuka 是不一样的。作为 Sakura 让我感觉空洞，仿佛内心的一切都缺失了。Sakura 对我来说并不真实。我不知道她会做什么或想什么。我只知道当我变成她时，Takashi 会开心。作为 Asuka 则不同。这是真实的。我以一种即使遇见 Sakura 也永远不会理解的方式理解她。但作为 Asuka 感觉在另一种意义上是错误的。她的想法和言论令人困扰。它们无法正确匹配。当我是她时，我感到一种沉重压在身上，仿佛她用她那瘦弱的双肩拖着整个世界。她的膝盖在压力下弯曲，我知道她会跌倒。我羞于承认，但有时我希望她会。我希望她在我面前支离破碎，永不归来。那样我就可以成为像 Sakura 那样的人。空洞而虚无。随着时间，我会找到填补空缺的方法。也许那时，我可以像 Sakura 接近 Takashi 那样接近 Shinji。但我知道那只是一个梦。

If Asuka ever falls, she'll be sure to take me down with her.
如果 Asuka 真的跌倒了，她肯定会把我一起拖下去。

Shinji could feel the anxiety rotting in his stomach. It had been a month and a half, almost 45 days, since Asuka had last agreed to see him. During that time he occupied himself in various ways. He spent most of his time attending school and lying to Hikari to cheer himself up. Hikari found the news of Asuka's steadily improving health to be a true blessing. Sometimes her smiles and hugs were the only things that stopped him from staying home and shutting himself in his room again. He had no idea what he would tell her if (when) Asuka got better and honestly he didn't want to think about it. Too depressing.
真嗣能感觉到焦虑在胃里腐烂。已经过去了一个半月，将近 45 天，自从上次明日香同意见他之后。在那段时间里，他以各种方式打发时间。他大部分时间都在上学，并对光说谎来让自己振作起来。光得知明日香健康状况稳步好转的消息，觉得真是天大的福音。有时她的微笑和拥抱是唯一阻止他再次呆在家里把自己关在房间里的东西。他不知道如果（当）明日香好转后该怎么告诉她，说实话他也不想去想这件事。太令人沮丧了。

He started practicing his cello again after a long hiatus. At first he picked up the instrument on a whim, but he soon found that playing music calmed him in a way he hadn't anticipated. It distracted him with a totality even the TV or his SDAT couldn't match. He figured it had something to do with the level of concentration involved. In any case, it helped him keep his mind off of things.
他在长时间的休息后重新开始练习大提琴。起初他只是心血来潮地拿起乐器，但很快发现演奏音乐以一种他未曾预料到的方式让他平静下来。它以一种连电视或他的 SDAT 都无法比拟的彻底性分散了他的注意力。他猜这和所需的专注程度有关。无论如何，这帮助他不去想那些烦心事。

When Shinji wasn't distracting himself from how lonely he felt, he was either sleeping or pestering Misato about Asuka's condition. Misato was amazingly skilled at letting information slip in the most annoying way possible. Any news he heard from her was vague and in small doses. It frustrated Shinji to no end that he could ask her a million different questions and only discover one new thing from the answers. The most detailed thing she had ever told him was "She's letting people call her by her name now," and that was it. Shinji had tried to call the hospital and get information directly from the source, but patient files were confidential. Only a legal guardian or family member could view the files or talk to a doctor about the patient's condition. So Shinji asked Misato to give them permission to discuss Asuka with him. Misato thought about it for all of thirty seconds before saying no and declaring it "a bad idea". Shinji tried not to hate her for it.
当真嗣没有用其他事情分散自己对孤独感的注意力时，他要么在睡觉，要么就缠着美里询问明日香的情况。美里极其擅长以最令人恼火的方式透露信息。他从她那里听到的消息总是含糊其辞且零零碎碎。真嗣无比沮丧，因为他可以问她无数个问题，却只能从答案中得知一件新的事情。她告诉他的最详细的信息不过是“她现在允许别人叫她的名字了”，仅此而已。真嗣曾试图打电话到医院，直接从源头获取信息，但患者档案是保密的。只有法定监护人或家属才能查看档案或与医生讨论患者的状况。于是真嗣请求美里授权他们与他讨论明日香的情况。美里考虑了整整三十秒后便拒绝了，并称这是“个馊主意”。真嗣尽量不因此而怨恨她。

And so passed 45 days. What had he accomplished? He'd grown slightly less rusty at cello, hounded his guardian for information so much that she spent even less time at home, and falsely built up the hopes of a girl who was already too hopeful for her own good. Meanwhile, Asuka had managed a breakthrough. And she was finally ready to see him again.
就这样，45 天过去了。他取得了什么成就呢？他的大提琴技艺稍有提升，不断追问监护人信息以至于她在家的时间更少了，还错误地激发了一个本就过于乐观的女孩的希望。与此同时，明日香取得了突破。她终于准备好再次见他了。

He took to the halls of the hospital one step at a time, stomach quietly rumbling with worry and fear. She'd made a breakthrough they said... a breakthrough. The nurse at the visitors' desk greeted him with her guarded smile. She wasn't happy to see him, but didn't seem to have anything against him either. He decide that he liked her. Seeing her somewhat familiar face calmed him down a bit. She asked him to sign in, just like she always did, and Shinji was relieved to find that he was aloud to walk to her room on his own. Nobody would have to wait outside the door during his visit.
他一步一步走在医院的走廊上，心中担忧与恐惧交织，胃里隐隐作痛。他们说她取得了突破……一个突破。访客台的护士带着谨慎的微笑迎接他。她见到他并不高兴，但似乎也不反感。他决定喜欢她。看到她那张略显熟悉的面孔让他稍微平静了一些。她像往常一样让他签到，这让真嗣松了一口气，因为他可以独自走到她的房间。这次探访，无需有人在门外等候。

Six doors down the hall to the left. Clean white tile all the way. Familiar.
左转，穿过六个门。一路洁白的瓷砖。熟悉。

He felt his stomach calming, if only a little. Something told him that this wasn't going to be like all the other visits. He just had this strange inkling somewhere in the back of his mind that this time was going to be okay. He reached her door and he hesitated only a few seconds before knocking. A few moments passed, then a click and a creak, and there she was standing at the door giving him the smallest of smiles. Her hair was drawn back in a ponytail with a red scrunchy. Shinji found himself oddly pleased that the scrunchy was red. She was wearing a white 3-buttoned blouse with loose fitting black slacks. Well... at least as loose fitting as any pants Asuka had ever worn. Apparently they let her wear her clothes from home. Her face was no longer tight and drawn with worry. Her eyes seemed light and alive. She looked healthy as if she'd been eating well. She seemed vital in a way that he hadn't seen her look for... well, years. And Shinji was staring at her openly. When he realized this he blushed, but Asuka just stood there with her small widening smile.
他感到胃部稍稍平复了一些。某种直觉告诉他，这次与以往的探访不同。他心中隐约有种奇怪的预感，这次一切都会好起来的。他走到她的门前，只犹豫了几秒钟便敲了敲门。片刻后，门发出一声轻响，她站在门口，给了他一个微小的微笑。她的头发用一个红色的发圈扎成了马尾。真嗣发现自己对那红色发圈感到莫名的高兴。她穿着一件白色三粒扣衬衫和宽松的黑色长裤。嗯……至少和明日香以往穿过的任何裤子一样宽松。显然，她可以穿自己的衣服。她的脸不再紧绷着忧虑。她的眼睛显得明亮而有生气。她看起来很健康，仿佛饮食得当。她显得充满活力，这是他多年来未曾见过的。而真嗣正直勾勾地盯着她。意识到这一点，他脸红了，但明日香只是站在那里，微笑逐渐扩大。

"Hello," said Shinji. He was awkwardly aware of how wide his eyebrows had gone.
“你好，”真嗣说道。他尴尬地意识到自己的眉毛抬得有多高。

"Hi Shinji," she said. "I'm very glad to see you."
"嗨，真嗣，" 她说道，"很高兴见到你。"

Shinji blushed harder and looked away. "It's good to see you too..." he paused a fraction of a second before adding, "Asuka."
真嗣的脸更红了，转过头去。"我也很高兴见到你……" 他停顿了一刹那，然后补充道，"明日香。"

"Thank you," she said and gave no other response. Only her words and her small insistent smile. Shinji glanced up at her and marveled.
"谢谢，" 她没有再说别的，只有她的言语和她那执着的小小微笑。真嗣抬头看向她，心中惊叹。

A breakthrough... 一个突破...

"I have something to show you," said Asuka. She grabbed his hand and lead him right back out the door. Shinji found himself in a pleasant daze. At this point he would have gone anywhere with her. She could have lead him off a cliff for all he cared. He felt like he could fly.
"我有东西给你看，"明日香说道。她抓住他的手，径直把他带出了门。真嗣发现自己沉浸在一种愉悦的恍惚中。此时此刻，他愿意随她去任何地方。哪怕她带他走向悬崖，他也毫不在意。他感觉自己仿佛能飞翔。

They walked a ways down the hall where they reached another nurse station which was surrounded by glass. Behind the glass Shinji could see two orderlies playing cards and a nurse at the computer playing minesweeper. Asuka knocked lightly on the glass to get their attention. The nurse at the computer swivelled in her chair to face them. When she saw Asuka she smiled.
他们沿着走廊走了一段路，来到另一个被玻璃环绕的护士站。透过玻璃，真嗣看到两名护工在玩扑克，还有一位护士在电脑前玩扫雷。明日香轻轻敲了敲玻璃以吸引他们的注意。坐在电脑前的护士转过椅子面对他们。当她看到明日香时，她露出了微笑。

"Can you let my guest and I through?"
"能让我和我的客人进去吗？"

"Of course," said the nurse. She pressed a button under the counter and a short buzzard went off. "You can go in now."
"当然，"护士说。她按下柜台下的一个按钮，随即传来一阵短促的蜂鸣声。"现在可以进去了。"

Asuka thanked the woman and Shinji followed suit. She pulled open the door next to the nurses' station and ushered Shinji through.
明日香向那位女士道谢，真嗣也跟着致谢。她拉开护士站旁边的门，示意真嗣进去。

"This is the recreation room," she said brightly. "They let the patients with milder problems come here to enjoy activities and relax."
"这里是娱乐室，" 她兴高采烈地说道。"他们让病情较轻的病人来这里参加活动，放松心情。"

Shinji took in the sight without much amazement. It was a large white room, not unlike all the others in the hospital. There were several tables scattered throughout the room each occupied by patients or nurses sitting in fold-up chairs. The most distinguishing feature of the room was the large 3-frame window in the middle which overlooking a small garden. Shinji found it kind of ironic that the best thing about the room was the view outside, but he didn't say anything of the sort to Asuka. He could tell that she was proud to be there. They had never let her mingle with the other patients before.
真嗣对这个景象并没有感到太多惊讶。这是一个宽敞的白色房间，和其他病房没什么两样。房间里散布着几张桌子，每张桌子旁都有病人或护士坐在折叠椅上。房间最显著的特点是中间那扇大型的三格窗户，窗外是一个小花园。真嗣觉得这房间最吸引人的反而是外面的景色，有点讽刺，但他没对明日香说这些。他能看出她对能来这里感到自豪。他们以前从未让她和其他病人接触过。

"Hmm... he's not here..." said Asuka sadly.
"嗯...他不在这里..." 明日香难过地说道。

"Who?" "谁？"

"A friend of mine. He's a nice man, like you. I wanted to introduce you. Maybe you could have met Sakura too... but, oh well. He must be in his room."
"我的一位朋友。他是个好人，像你一样。我想介绍你们认识。也许你还能见到小樱……不过，算了。他应该在他房间里。"

"Oh," said Shinji. He felt slightly guilty for wondering just what type of friends she could have made in such a place. Asuka didn't give him much time to ponder on this though. She begin to lead him around the room and show him the various activities.
"哦，" 真嗣说道。他感到一丝内疚，好奇她在这样的地方能结交什么样的朋友。但明日香没给他太多时间思考这个问题。她开始带他在房间里转悠，展示各种活动。

"Over here they have an area for knitting and crochet. A lady told me that they used to let them sew too, but they decided that they'd rather not let us have sharp needles. Here they have some magazines, but none of them are too interesting. We play board games at that table. There's a lot of missing pieces, but some of them are still playable. And over there we play cards. Would you like to play?"
"这边是编织和钩针区。有位女士告诉我，他们以前还允许缝纫，但后来决定不让我们用尖锐的针了。这里有几本杂志，但都不太有趣。我们在那张桌子上玩桌游。虽然缺了不少零件，但有些还能玩。那边是玩纸牌的地方。你想玩吗？"

The table was empty save for a lone deck of cards. They took a seat and Asuka began to count the cards. After she was sure there were fifty two of them, she dealt out the whole deck.
桌上空无一物，只有一副孤零零的扑克牌。他们坐了下来，Asuka 开始数牌。确认有五十二张后，她将整副牌发了出去。

"I hope you don't mind playing war," said Asuka. Shinji said nothing, but he didn't appear to have any complaints. "She..." Asuka blinked twice before continuing, "I don't know many games that don't involve betting and gambling is against the rules. Still I'm glad to have someone to play with. My friend, Takashi, is hardly ever up to it so I usually end up playing solitary by myself when I'm lucky enough to get the cards."
“希望你不介意玩战争游戏，”Asuka 说道。Shinji 没有说话，但看起来并没有什么不满。“她……”Asuka 眨了两次眼，然后继续说，“我不太知道那些不涉及赌博的游戏，赌博是违反规定的。不过有个人一起玩，我还是挺高兴的。我的朋友 Takashi 很少有兴致，所以我通常只能幸运地拿到牌时自己玩单人游戏。”

Shinji said, "Ok." Immediately afterward he felt as if this answer was lame, so he added, "I'm glad I can play with you."
Shinji 说：“好的。”随即他觉得这个回答有些乏味，于是补充道：“我很高兴能和你一起玩。”

Asuka spared him an appraising glance before flipping her first card. Apparently they had started to play. After about three flips, Asuka chastised him for not flipping with her at the same time. She insisted that the game was more fun that way. Other than that, there was little conversation between them. Shinji took note of the other hospital patients. He found himself oddly surprised by the fact that most of them seemed in good health. In retrospect it wasn't that surprising. This wasn't a medical hospital. But even so, the patients made him feel a bit uneasy. There was something instinctively odd about knowing that the people around you were certifiably crazy. It was strange that this feeling never seemed to include Asuka herself. He realized that the other patients were perhaps no better or worse than the girl sitting across from him, but that didn't make his discomfort go away. It didn't help that a few of them were openly staring at them. He supposed it wasn't often that the hospital had patients or visitors as young as him.
明日香瞥了他一眼，似乎在评估什么，随后翻开了她的第一张牌。看来游戏已经开始了。大约翻了三次后，明日香责备他没有和她同时翻牌，坚持说这样玩更有趣。除此之外，两人之间几乎没有交谈。真嗣留意了一下其他住院病人，惊讶地发现他们大多看起来很健康。回想起来，这并不奇怪，这里并非医疗机构。尽管如此，这些病人还是让他感到些许不安。知道周围的人都是被确诊的疯子，这种感觉本能地有些怪异。奇怪的是，这种感觉似乎从未包括明日香本人。他意识到，其他病人或许并不比坐在他对面的女孩好或坏，但这并没有减轻他的不适感。再加上有几个人公然盯着他们看，这更让他不自在。他猜想，医院里像他这么年轻的病人或访客并不常见。

To Shinji the game seemed to last an eternity. Though he did his best to smile and enjoy himself for Asuka, his discomfort clearly showed by the way he nervously glanced around the room. Asuka took note of this as well.
对真嗣来说，这场游戏仿佛持续了一个世纪。尽管他尽力微笑，为了明日香而享受其中，但他不安地环顾房间的样子明显透露出他的不适。明日香也注意到了这一点。

"Do you want to do something else?" she asked, a note of melancholy in her voice. Shinji instantly felt like a heel.
“你想做点别的吗？”她问道，声音中带着一丝忧郁。真嗣立刻觉得自己像个混蛋。

"No. This is okay, really."
“不，这样挺好的，真的。”

Asuka placed her remaining cards in the middle of the table and stood from her chair.
明日香将剩下的牌放在桌子中央，从椅子上站了起来。

"It's alright. It's a very long game anyways. I should have picked something else..."
“没关系。反正这游戏很长。我应该选别的……”

"We can finish playing if you want."
“如果你想的话，我们可以继续玩。”

"No, that's okay," said Asuka with a small little smirk. "I don't want to bore you. But if anyone asks about this, be sure to tell them that I won."
"不，没关系，" 明日香带着一丝小小的得意说道，"我不想让你觉得无聊。但如果有人问起这件事，记得告诉他们是我赢了。"

Classic Asuka. Shinji couldn't help but smile and say, "Of course."
典型的明日香。真嗣忍不住微笑着回答："当然。"

She had one more thing to show him. After having the nurse buzz them out of the recreation room Asuka led him down another short hallway hand in hand. Shinji wasn't sure if he'd ever get used to that particular feeling, but did not mind the surprise. When she held onto his hand as they exited a glass door into the courtyard an odd thought entered his brain. He wondered if this was what a date felt like.
她还有一样东西要给他看。在护士帮他们从娱乐室离开后，明日香牵着他的手，带他走过另一条短走廊。真嗣不确定自己是否能习惯这种感觉，但他并不介意这份惊喜。当她握着他的手，一起穿过玻璃门进入庭院时，一个奇怪的想法闪过他的脑海。他不禁想，这会不会就是约会的感觉。

"What do you think?" Asuka asked. It was a small enclosed area with a small wooden park bench surrounded by a handful of trees and bushes. The whole enclosed area couldn't have been much bigger than the living room of Misato's apartment, but the space was well used. Despite the wide window that put them in plain view of the recreation room, the area produced a sense of privacy.
"你觉得这里怎么样？" 明日香问道。这是一个小而封闭的空间，里面有一张木制的长椅，四周环绕着几棵树和灌木丛。整个区域的大小可能还不如美里公寓的客厅，但空间利用得很好。尽管有一扇宽大的窗户让他们直接暴露在娱乐室的视线中，这个区域却营造出一种私密感。

"It's nice," said Shinji honestly. "Peaceful."
"很棒，" 真嗣真诚地说道，"很宁静。"

Asuka nodded in agreement. "It's the best place in the hospital. They let me come out here anytime I want, as long as it's not raining or past curfew." The confident way she looked up at him was encouraging to Shinji. Once again he was overwhelmed by that irrational feeling that everything was going to be okay.
明日香点头表示同意。"这是医院里最好的地方。只要不是下雨或者过了宵禁时间，他们允许我随时来这里。" 她自信地抬头看着他，这让真嗣感到鼓舞。又一次，他无法抑制那种不理性的感觉，觉得一切都会好起来的。

"I'm proud of you," he said and squeezed her hand lightly. He couldn't have meant it more. The two of them took a seat on the park bench. Shinji found himself staring at a bed of bright red flowers. He didn't look up, but he had the feeling that Asuka was looking at him. For some reason that seemed okay. He didn't feel the need to look at her at all. Everything would be okay.
"我为你感到骄傲，" 他说着轻轻握了握她的手。他的话发自肺腑。两人在公园长椅上坐下。真嗣发现自己盯着一丛鲜红的花朵。他没有抬头，但感觉阿斯卡在看着他。不知为何，这样似乎没什么不妥。他完全不需要看她。一切都会好起来的。

"I'm very happy right now," said Asuka. She leaned her head on his shoulder as she talked. For a moment, he shivered from the feel of her breath brushing by his cheek. "I didn't know if you would forgive me. If I were you, I wouldn't have, but I'm glad you're not like that. I wanted to see you sooner but I'd made such a fool of myself before... I just wanted to make sure that this time things went well. You understand don't you?"
"我现在非常开心，" 阿斯卡说道。她边说边把头靠在他的肩上。有那么一刻，他因她呼吸拂过脸颊的感觉而微微颤抖。"我不知道你是否会原谅我。如果我是你，我不会原谅，但我很高兴你不是那样的人。我本想早点见你，但之前我表现得那么愚蠢...我只是想确保这次一切顺利。你明白的，对吧？"

Shinji said, "Yeah." He couldn't imagine being mad at her now. Not when they were so close like this.
真嗣说："嗯。" 他现在无法想象对她生气。尤其是当他们如此亲近的时候。

"They don't even lock my door anymore," said Asuka in a near whisper. "Only at night. I have all the rights of a voluntary patient."
"他们现在连我的门都不锁了，" 明日香近乎耳语般说道，"只有晚上才锁。我享有自愿患者的所有权利。"

Shinji heart swelled with each word. It really was a breakthrough.
真嗣的心随着每一个字而膨胀。这确实是一个突破。

"Dr. Komatsu says I'm making great progress. He says that when I'm ready I could even go home. He says that as long as I attended regular consoling sessions, I could easily move back home with you."
"小松医生说我进步很大。他说等我准备好了，甚至可以回家。他说只要我定期参加咨询会话，就能轻松地搬回去和你一起住。"

Shinji looked down at Asuka in confusion. She reluctantly lifted her head from his shoulder.
真嗣困惑地低头看着明日香。她不情愿地从他的肩膀上抬起头来。

"Then why... why are you still here?"
“那为什么...你为什么还在这儿？”

Asuka closed her eyes and took a deep breath.
明日香闭上眼睛，深吸了一口气。

"I don't want to go back yet."
"我还不想回去。"

"Why?" asked Shinji. "为什么？"真嗣问道。

"She's... well you said it before... she's lost."
"她... 嗯，你之前说过了... 她迷失了。"

Shinji felt desperation sinking in. "Who?"
真嗣感到绝望在心头蔓延。 "谁？"

"Asuka," said Asuka with the saddest of smiles. "It's like you said. She's just this girl... and I know, I know she's a part of me. But she's out there somewhere and she's lost. I can't... I can't feel her anymore. I just... right now I can't be that person. And I know that you're waiting for me. I don't know why you do it, but I know that you're waiting for us to come home. But I can't go back yet. Not until I find her."
"明日香," 明日香带着最悲伤的微笑说道。"就像你说的那样。她只是个女孩... 我知道，我知道她是我的一部分。但她迷失在某个地方，我无法... 我再也感受不到她了。我只是... 现在我无法成为那个人。我知道你在等我。我不知道你为什么这么做，但我知道你在等我们回家。但我还不能回去。在我找到她之前，我不能回去。"

"Asuka..." "明日香……"

"I'm sorry." "我很抱歉。"

Shinji tried one desperate plea. "Can't we look for her together?"
真嗣尝试了一次绝望的恳求。"我们不能一起找她吗？"

Asuka reached up a shaky hand to the other side of his face and gently raised her head to place a small kiss on his cheek.
明日香颤抖着手伸向他的另一边脸颊，轻轻抬起头，在他的脸颊上轻轻吻了一下。

"You're the only person she ever knew who would say something so tooth-rottingly sweet."
"你是她唯一认识的，会说这么甜到掉牙的话的人。"

Though a blush rose to his face, Shinji bowed his head in defeat. He realized there was nothing he could do to talk her out of it. She wasn't coming home yet. It was a while before Asuka grabbed his hand again and spoke.
尽管脸颊泛起红晕，真嗣还是低头认输了。他意识到自己无法说服她改变主意。她还不会回家。过了一会儿，明日香再次握住他的手，开口说道。

"I'm going to find her Shinji," she said with quiet determination. "I'm not going to give up. But this is something that I have to do alone. That's why... this is going to be the last time you ever visit me in this hospital."
"我要找到她，真嗣，"她带着坚定的语气轻声说道，"我不会放弃。但这件事我必须独自完成。所以...这将是你最后一次来这家医院看我。"

For a moment, Shinji felt as if he'd been slapped. Headless of this, Asuka continued.
有那么一瞬间，真嗣感觉自己像是被扇了一巴掌。对此浑然不觉的明日香继续说道。

"When I see you again, I'm going to be the person I was meant to be. I want all these problems to be behind me. And then maybe... maybe we can be as close as we want to be. Okay?"
当我再次见到你时，我会成为我本应成为的那个人。我希望所有这些问题都成为过去。然后也许……也许我们可以像我们想要的那样亲密。好吗？

Shinji finally looked up from the ground. He looked to the red flowers in the garden, then looked into Asuka's face.
真嗣终于从地上抬起头来。他看向花园里的红花，然后看向明日香的脸。

"Okay," he said and he said it with a smile.
“好的，”他说着，脸上带着微笑。

Everything was going to be okay.
一切都会好起来的。

Shinji took off his shoes at the door of the apartment. His body felt as light as air. He wasn't sure what was holding him down anymore. The dull colors of the apartment seemed oddly bright and vibrant. When he heard the laugh track from the sitcom on TV he wanted to laugh along. He couldn't help but let a small chuckle slip through. When he entered the living room he was glad to see Misato laying there on the couch in her NERV uniform. It was the first time in months that he could honestly say he was glad to see her. When she saw him enter the room she lowered the volume on the TV with the remote.
真嗣在公寓门口脱下鞋子。他的身体感觉轻如鸿毛。他不确定还有什么在束缚着他。公寓里暗淡的色彩此刻显得异常明亮和生动。当他听到电视上情景喜剧的笑声时，他忍不住想跟着笑。他情不自禁地发出了一声轻笑。走进客厅时，他很高兴看到美里穿着 NERV 制服躺在沙发上。这是几个月来他第一次诚实地感到见到她是件高兴的事。当她看到他走进房间时，她用遥控器调低了电视的音量。

"How was your visit?" asked Misato with the most peculiar look on her face.
"你这次拜访怎么样？" 美里脸上带着最奇特的表情问道。

"It was fine," said Shinji grinning from ear to ear. "We played cards."
"挺好的，" 真嗣咧嘴笑着说，"我们玩了扑克。"

"Oh?"

"Yeah" said Shinji. "She won."
"是啊，" 真嗣说，"她赢了。"

A/N: Not the last chapter.
作者注：并非最后一章。

### Chapter 5

**A/N:** We all saw something like this coming.  
A/N：我们都预料到会有类似的情况发生。

---
Some things just aren't easy to do. She stalled as long as she could. Lord knows she tried to resolve the problem another way. If there was another way, _any_ other way, Misato would have found it, because that's what people do when they're determined... when they're desperate. She gave much thought to the issue. Considered all the possible consequences. There was no way it would end well. There was no good way to break the news. She had considered never telling him, but that would only backfire on her later. Asuka called him almost nightly since the hospital granted her phone privileges. He would grow suspicious in a couple of days.  
有些事情就是难以轻易完成。她尽可能地拖延。天知道她尝试过用其他方法解决问题。如果有其他办法，任何办法，美里都会找到的，因为这就是人在决心已定...在绝望时会做的事。她对这个问题深思熟虑，考虑了所有可能的后果。事情不可能有好结果。没有好的方式来传达这个消息。她曾考虑过永远不告诉他，但那样只会让事情日后反弹得更糟。自医院允许她使用电话以来，明日香几乎每晚都给他打电话。再过几天，他就会起疑心了。

Still, Misato waited as long as she could. A full day passed before before she sat Shinji down in the living room and asked him to talk. She tried to be gentle and comforting and that put him on edge. The soft tone of her voice and the way she continued to stare at him, gauging his reaction. She hadn't said a word and he was already in distress.  
尽管如此，美里还是尽可能地等待。整整一天过去，她才让真嗣坐在客厅里，请求与他谈谈。她试图温柔和安慰，但这让他感到不安。她柔和的语调和持续盯着他、评估他反应的方式，让她还没开口，他就已经陷入了困扰。

"Shinji... I..." “真嗣...我...”

Misato stopped and took two long yet shallow breaths. There was something awful in Shinji's face. It reminded her of the time she told Kaji she was transferring to work in another city and that he shouldn't try to follow. He knew what was coming before she'd spoken. Known it and dreaded it it. And Misato had to say it anyways. _It's an awful feeling..._  
美里停下脚步，深深地吸了两口短促的气。真嗣脸上的神情让她感到一阵心悸。这让她想起了自己告诉加持要调到另一个城市工作，让他不要试图跟随的那一刻。他甚至在她说出口之前就已知晓即将发生的事，既知道又害怕。而美里还是不得不说出口。那种感觉真是糟糕透顶……

"Asuka's gone missing." “明日香失踪了。”

_...to deliberately break someone's heart.  
……故意伤人心碎。_

"Wha... you... no... no..."  
"什...你...不...不..."

Shinji faltered in his speech, but Misato pressed forward with her explanation. The faster he accepted it, the easier it would be.  
真嗣说话结巴了，但美里继续解释。他越快接受，事情就越简单。

"She's been gone for a few hours now."  
"她已经离开几个小时了。"

_A day and a half... 37 hours since the nurse found her room empty. And I didn't tell you because I thought we could find her without you. But we can't. And I will die before you find out how long I waited to tell you because I am a coward who has no shame. I have tried to feel bad about this and many other things, but I've only failed. As long as you're okay I can continue to live this way. I can continue to pretend that I didn't spend the last 2 years of my life contributing to an organization which had no problem driving the two of you to insanity. I can pretend that your eyes aren't filled with resentment and distrust every time I see your face. I can pretend that these feelings, even if they did exist, are unfounded. That I am not a person worthy of resentment. And I can live with you near me and pretend that you're with me and that we're all on the edge of happiness, not despair. And if you ruin that for me tonight... I don't know what I'll do...  
一天半了... 自从护士发现她的房间空无一人已经过去了 37 个小时。我没告诉你是因为我以为我们能不靠你就找到她。但我们做不到。我宁愿死也不会让你知道我拖了多久才告诉你，因为我是个无耻的懦夫。我试图为此和许多其他事情感到内疚，但我只失败了。只要你没事，我就能继续这样生活下去。我可以继续假装我没有在过去两年里为那个毫不介意把你们俩逼疯的组织做出贡献。我可以假装每次看到你的脸时，你的眼睛里没有充满怨恨和不信任。我可以假装这些感觉，即使它们存在，也是没有根据的。我不是一个值得怨恨的人。我可以和你在一起，假装你和我在一起，我们都在幸福的边缘，而不是绝望。如果今晚你毁了这一切...我不知道我会怎么做..._

"Where is she?" “她在哪儿？”

"We don't know Shinji, that's why-"  
“我们不知道，真嗣，这就是为什么-”

"_Where's Asuka!"_ "明日香在哪儿！"

"Calm down." "冷静点。"

In an instant he was up on his feet.  
转眼间，他已站起身来。

"I've got to find her, I've got to..."  
"我必须找到她，我必须……"

He headed for the door.  
他朝门口走去。

"Wait," said Misato and surprisingly he did stop. "I have people looking for her already. If you go out there all you're going to do is complicate things."  
"等等，"美里说道，出乎意料地，他真的停下了。"我已经派人在找她了。如果你出去，只会让事情变得更复杂。"

"But she's... she's out there and... by herself. And anything could happen to her and _she told me not to come, but why did I listen!_ God, I gotta find her she's lost out there."  
"但她...她在外面，而且...独自一人。任何事情都可能发生在她身上，她告诉我不要去，但我为什么要听！天啊，我得找到她，她在外面迷路了。"

Misato moved to where he stood and placed a hand on Shinji's shoulder. He looked at her as if she were insane.  
美里走到他站立的地方，将手放在真嗣的肩膀上。他看着她，仿佛她疯了一样。

"You can't help her that way," said Misato quietly. There was just enough metal in her voice to reinforce the statement as fact, not opinion. "If you know of any places she might have gone, anybody she'd want to go see, please tell me and we can get someone to-"  
"你不能那样帮她，"美里平静地说道。她的声音中恰到好处地带着坚定，使得这句话听起来像是事实，而非意见。"如果你知道她可能去的地方，她想见的人，请告诉我，我们可以派人去-"

Shinji shrugged her hand away and quickly made for the door.  
真嗣甩开她的手，迅速向门口走去。

"Wait," said Misato. He did not heed her. He scrambled to put his shoes on. It was a messy, hasty affair.  
“等等，”美里说。他没有理会她。他慌忙地穿上鞋子，整个过程既凌乱又仓促。

"This doesn't make any sense. There's nothing you can do for her right now. Just... trust me okay?"  
“这说不通。你现在什么也做不了。就...相信我，好吗？”

Shinji didn't say a word. He opened the door and walked into the hallway without closing it. Misato stood in the doorway behind him.  
真嗣一言未发。他推开门，走进走廊，却没有关上它。美里站在他身后的门口。

"Dammit Shinji! What are you going to do? Where are you going to find her? We have enough people out there looking for her already, but now we'll have to have people looking for you too! Is that what you want? You're only hurting our chances. They were damn slim to begin with and you're killing them now. You idiot! You bastard!" Misato's voice suddenly grew weaker. "Get back in here. Don't leave..."  
“该死的真嗣！你到底想干什么？你要去哪儿找她？我们已经有足够多的人在外面找她了，现在还得派人找你！这就是你想要的吗？你只是在破坏我们的机会。本来希望就很渺茫，现在你更是让它们化为泡影。你这个白痴！混蛋！”美里的声音突然变得虚弱。“回来。别走……”

But Shinji was around the corner and he didn't even look back. Probably didn't hear a word she said. And so what? Screw him. Let him leave. They always leave and she's better off without them because when you're by yourself they _can't_ leave you anymore. And all he ever did was hurt her and take from her... _but you took from him too_... and if he's gone will there ever be another one willing to stay? Probably not. Not for Misato because... _all my friends are dead_. But screw the whole lot of them. She didn't need them but- _I hate being alone_- and he's all she had.  
但真嗣已经转过拐角，甚至没有回头看一眼。可能他一个字也没听见。那又怎样？去他的。让他走吧。他们总是离开，没有他们她会更好，因为当你独自一人时，他们就无法再离开你了。而他所做的只是伤害她，从她那里索取……但你也从他那里索取了……如果他走了，还会有谁愿意留下呢？可能不会有了。不会为美里留下，因为……我所有的朋友都死了。但去他的，她不需要他们，但是——我讨厌孤单——而他却是她唯一的依靠。  
_  
All I have... 我所有的……_

Her coat and shoes were on. She hastily grabbed her car keys in hand. Swiftly she walked down the hall, took the steps two at a time, and nearly ran into the parking garage. She pressed a button on the key chain and the car unlocked. In the door, start the engine, put it in gear and drive.  
她的外套和鞋子已经穿好。她匆忙抓起车钥匙在手，迅速走过走廊，一步两级地下了楼梯，几乎跑进停车场。她按下钥匙扣上的按钮，车门解锁。进入车内，启动引擎，挂上档位，驱车前行。

It was a long street. He either went left, or he went right, but he couldn't have gotten too far on foot. She turned right, driving several miles over the speed limit. Carefully, she scanned both sides of the street. 5 minutes in and still no sign of him. She pulled into a drive way and turned around. Driving faster to make up for lost time, she found him walking in the same direction. She slowed the car to match his pace and rolled down the window. His head was panning the horizon for any sign of Asuka. He was calling out her name.  
那是一条长街。他要么向左走，要么向右走，但步行不可能走得太远。她向右转，车速超过了限速几英里。她小心翼翼地扫视着街道两侧。五分钟过去了，依然不见他的踪影。她驶入一条车道掉头返回。为了弥补失去的时间，她加快了车速，终于看到他正朝同一方向步行。她放慢车速与他同步，摇下车窗。他的头正四处张望，寻找着明日香的踪迹。他大声呼喊着她的名字。

"Get in the car Shinji."  
"上车，真嗣。"

"Asuka! Come on Asuka!" "明日香！快点，明日香！"

"It's a big city. She won't hear you."  
"城市这么大，她听不见你的。"

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

"Please get in the car."  
"请上车。"

"Asuka, where are you!" "明日香，你在哪儿！"

"If you get in the car we can look together. It'd be a lot faster that way."  
"如果你上车，我们可以一起找。这样会快得多。"

He looked at her for a second as if truly considering the offer. Misato was surprised, as it was an idea that just randomly sprang into her head. But in a moment, Shinji looked away from her and continued his search.  
他看了她一秒钟，仿佛真的在考虑这个提议。美里感到惊讶，因为这个想法是突然蹦进她脑海的。但很快，真嗣移开了视线，继续他的搜索。

"Asuka!" Yelled Shinji, cupping his hands around his mouth.  
“明日香！”真嗣大喊，双手围在嘴边。

"This is pointless," said Misato. "I'm leaving."  
“这毫无意义，”美里说，“我要走了。”

But she didn't leave. Didn't make the slightest move to do so. The car continued to move at the same steady pace as Shinji.  
但她没有离开。丝毫没有要走的意思。车子继续以与真嗣相同的稳定速度前行。

"What good will screaming out her name do if she doesn't want to be found? She'll hear you calling and run the other way."  
“如果她不想被找到，你大声喊她的名字有什么用？她听到你的呼唤只会跑向相反的方向。”

Shinji continued to walk, but for a while he was silent. Misato thought she had won a minor victory before he began to yell out the girl's name again.  
真嗣继续走着，但有一会儿他沉默了。美里以为自己赢得了一场小小的胜利，直到他再次大声呼喊那个女孩的名字。

"Do you even want to find her?" she asked. "If you really did you wouldn't be-"  
"你真的想找到她吗？如果你真心想找，你就不会这样……"

"_Shut up!"_ said Shinji. This was the first and only time he'd ever spoken to her this way. Misato recoiled as if slapped.  
"闭嘴！" 真嗣说道。这是他第一次也是唯一一次这样对她说话。美里像被扇了一巴掌似的退缩了。

"You don't even like Asuka! You wouldn't tell me anything about what was happening or how she was doing! You don't care about anything I ever told you about her. You just wanted me there for yourself. You never cared about her and you never cared about me. So just leave me the hell alone!"  
"你根本就不喜欢明日香！你从不告诉我任何关于她的情况或她过得如何！你对我告诉你的关于她的一切都不在乎。你只是想让我留在你身边。你从未关心过她，也从未关心过我。所以，就让我一个人待着吧！"

Misato stopped driving and Shinji continued to walk. She watched as he got further and further ahead. She tried to think of the ignorance of children, how they say one thing one day and the opposite the next. But Shinji wasn't just a kid anymore. He meant what he said. He was going to walk away, and he wasn't coming back.  
美里停下车，真嗣继续前行。她看着他越走越远。她试图想起孩子们的无知，他们今天说一件事，明天又完全相反。但真嗣已不再是个孩子了。他说的话是认真的。他要走，而且不会回来了。

She could make a few calls and have him detained. She still had enough lingering influence over certain former Section 2 members to do that. But if he honestly felt that way, what difference would it make? It'd be just as useless as what he was doing now. So instead she watched him leave with tears glistening in her eyes.  
她可以打几个电话让人把他扣留。她对某些前第二分部成员仍有足够的影响力来做到这一点。但如果他真的那么想，那又有什么区别呢？这和他现在所做的同样无用。于是，她含泪目送他离去。

When Kodama still lived at home, Hikari always placed three sets of dishes at the dinner table. At first she didn't even realize she was doing it. She would sit across from Kodama and they would make light conversation which always lapsed into silence. Hikari would barely take note of her sister's occasional glances towards the empty place setting. Sometimes she would look in that direction as well, but she saw nothing odd about the situation. It was only when Kodama politely pointed out that there were only two of them eating, that Hikari recognized the error of setting a place for Nozomi. She remembered feeling embarrassed about it and blushing heavily.  
当小玉还住在家里时，光总是会在餐桌上摆上三套餐具。起初她甚至没有意识到自己在这么做。她会坐在小玉对面，两人轻松地交谈，话题总是不知不觉陷入沉默。光几乎不会注意到妹妹偶尔瞥向空位子的目光。有时她也会朝那个方向看去，但她并不觉得这种情况有什么奇怪。直到小玉礼貌地指出其实只有她们两个人在吃饭时，光才意识到为望美准备餐具是个错误。她记得当时为此感到尴尬，脸红得厉害。

Hikari recognized that Nozomi most likely wouldn't be coming back. It happened to a lot of little kids after the impact. Some psychologist said that it had something to do with the minds of young children being too fragile and uncertain to manifest themselves physically, but that explanation didn't account for the few children who did manage to make it out of the sea. In some cases children as young as toddlers have returned.  
光意识到望美很可能不会再回来了。撞击事件后，很多小孩都遭遇了这种情况。有心理学家说，这可能与幼儿脆弱而不确定的心灵无法在物理上显现有关，但这种解释并未涵盖那些成功从海中逃脱的少数孩子。有些甚至只有两三岁的孩子也回来了。

Once Hikari recognized her mistake, she did nothing to remedy it. She tried a few nights eating without the extra dishes serving as a place holder, but somehow that felt alien and strange. It was as if she had given up on Nozomi, which in some ways she had. People were coming back less and less frequently as the years drug on. Hikari no longer waited up at night to hear news that her little sister had come home. Yet despite Kodama's obvious discomfort and her own fading optimism, she continued to set a place for the girl. When Kodama left to attend Tokyo-2 University, Hikari cut back to two dinner plates.  
当光意识到自己的错误后，她并未采取任何补救措施。她尝试了几晚不使用额外的盘子作为占位符，但不知为何，这让她感到陌生和奇怪。仿佛她已经放弃了望，某种程度上，她的确如此。随着时间的推移，人们回来的次数越来越少。光不再熬夜等待听到她的小妹妹回家的消息。尽管小玉明显的不适和自己的渐失希望，她仍继续为那女孩留出一个位置。当小玉离家去东京第二大学就读时，光将晚餐盘子减少到了两个。

In some ways Hikari missed Kodama just as much as she did Nozomi, but overall it was a good thing that she decided to move out. Kodama always had her sights set on bigger and better things, even if she didn't always know what those things were. Hikari could tell that a part of her despised their broken little home in the same way that she hated Nozomi and their father for leaving it. Kodama was glad to be gone and Hikari tried to be happy for her. At least she sent money home monthly and never failed to make it back for the holidays.  
在某些方面，光对小玉的思念不亚于对望的，但总的来说，她决定搬出去是件好事。小玉总是志向远大，即便她并不总是清楚那些目标是什么。光能感觉到，她的一部分憎恨着他们破败的小家，正如她憎恨望和他们的父亲离开一样。小玉很高兴离开，光也尽量为她感到高兴。至少她每月都会寄钱回家，也从未错过节日回家。

For the most part, Hikari didn't mind living alone. In some ways it was a welcome change to her life at school which consisted mostly of concerns for other people. She overwhelmed herself with her own conviction. She wanted so many good things for so many people that it hurt sometimes. It seemed as if everyone was in pain. Hikari felt that pain acutely. She strained herself to find new ways to help the people around her. And while she took great joy in doing the little bit she could to ameliorate the situation, it never felt like enough. When at home those pressures diminished. Within the privacy of these familiar four walls she was finally able to take care of herself. Tonight was no different.  
大多数时候，光并不介意独自生活。在某种程度上，这对她在学校的生活是一种可喜的变化，那里她大部分时间都在关心他人。她被自己的信念所淹没。她希望为许多人带来许多美好，有时这让她感到痛苦。似乎每个人都在受苦。光深切地感受到这种痛苦。她竭尽全力寻找帮助身边人的新方法。尽管她很高兴能尽自己所能改善情况，但总感觉还不够。在家时，这些压力减轻了。在这熟悉的四面墙内，她终于能够照顾好自己。今晚也不例外。

After school Hikari began her familiar routine. She went to her room and changed out of her school uniform. Despite being the only resident of the home she still slept in the room she once shared with Kodama as if the ghost of her father scared her away from the master bedroom. After dressing in a pair of shorts and a loose fitting t-shirt she made her way into the kitchen and put on a pot of tea. Occasionally she liked to try different flavors, but peach would always be her favorite. When the tea was ready she poured herself a cup and brought it into the living room on a tray. Hikari settled into her favorite chair and turned on the TV. She quickly turned the channel when she noticed the evening news was on. The sad stories sometimes made her cry. She flipped through channels aimlessly until she stumbled upon an old sitcom that had been in syndication before either impact affected the world.  
放学后，光开始了她熟悉的日常。她回到房间，换下校服。尽管是家中唯一的居住者，她仍睡在曾经与小玉共用的房间，仿佛父亲的幽灵吓得她不敢靠近主卧。换上一条短裤和一件宽松的 T 恤后，她走进厨房，烧上一壶茶。偶尔她会尝试不同口味，但桃子味始终是她的最爱。茶煮好后，她倒了一杯，放在托盘上端进客厅。光窝进她最喜欢的椅子，打开了电视。她迅速换台，因为注意到正在播放晚间新闻。那些悲伤的故事有时会让她落泪。她漫无目的地翻着频道，直到偶然发现一部在两次撞击事件影响世界之前就已进入联播的老情景喜剧。

The show was called Rolling With the Family. It was an old American sitcom that had been poorly dubbed into Japanese. The star of the show was a sarcastic middle aged matriarch who was in charge of her quirky and colorful family. She made all the decisions in the house while giving the appearance of submitting to her loving, yet stubborn husband. The children were often disobedient, but never subordinate and it was clear that everybody loved each other. Things went wrong in their little world, but in a half an hour the problems always repaired themselves. It was perfect. Hikari had just begun to lose herself in the light instrumentals of the title sequence when she heard a knock on her door. She jumped in surprise.  
这部剧叫做《与家人同行》。它是一部老旧的美国情景喜剧，被拙劣地配音成了日语。剧中的明星是一位爱挖苦人的中年女家长，她负责管理她那古怪而多彩的家族。她在家里做所有决定，同时表面上顺从她那慈爱却固执的丈夫。孩子们常常不听话，但绝不卑躬屈膝，显然每个人都彼此相爱。他们的世界里事情总会出错，但在半小时内问题总能自行解决。这完美极了。光刚沉浸在片头轻快的器乐旋律中时，就听到有人敲门。她吓了一跳。

"I'm coming," she called, but the frantic knocking continued.  
“我来了，”她喊道，但急促的敲门声依旧不停。

Hikari wasn't particularly afraid of crime, having lived in the better areas of Tokyo-3 most of her life, but her father had instilled several safety habits in her that would not leave. She peered through the peep hole briefly before unlocking the door and opening it. Shinji stared at her with a startled expression, as if he hadn't expected to be let in. He was sweating profusely like he'd been running for miles. His eyelids were half closed despite his eyebrows being raised to their highest height. Hikari let out a gasp of surprised.  
光并不特别害怕犯罪，她一生大部分时间都住在东京-3 的较好地区，但她的父亲灌输给她的几个安全习惯始终未曾忘记。她透过猫眼匆匆看了一眼，然后才解锁开门。真嗣带着惊讶的表情盯着她，仿佛没想到会被允许进来。他满头大汗，好像跑了好几英里。尽管他的眉毛抬到了最高点，眼皮却半闭着。光惊讶地倒吸了一口气。

"Shinji what's wrong?" she asked.  
“真嗣，怎么了？”她问道。

"Have you seen her?" asked Shinji, his voice strained with anticipation. "Is she here?"  
“你见过她吗？”真嗣问道，声音因期待而紧绷。“她在这里吗？”

Hikari felt even more alarmed.  
光感到更加惊慌。

"Who are you talking about?"  
“你在说谁？”

Shinji didn't answer her. Instead he hung his head and shamefully began to cry. For a moment Hikari stared at him as he tried to hide his weeping by burying his face in the crook of his arm. Before long she regained her bearings, grabbed him by the shoulder and gently lead him through the doorway. She quietly closed and locked the door behind her before guiding the weeping young man through the hallway and into the kitchen. Hikari sat him down at the table and pulled up another seat as close as possible. She placed an arm around his shoulder and took one of his hands into her own. She gave his hand a squeeze and said as firmly as she could, "Everything will be okay."  
真嗣没有回答她。相反，他低下头，羞愧地开始哭泣。一时间，光盯着他，看着他试图将脸埋在臂弯里掩饰哭泣。不久，她恢复了镇定，抓住他的肩膀，温柔地领他穿过门口。她轻轻地关上门并锁上，然后带着哭泣的年轻人穿过走廊进入厨房。光让他坐在桌旁，拉过另一把尽可能靠近的椅子。她将一只手臂搭在他的肩上，握住他的一只手。她紧握他的手，尽可能坚定地说：“一切都会好起来的。”

Hikari wondered if those words were true as Shinji continued to cry. The intensity of his sobbing decreased, but it was several minutes before the tears completely ceased to flow. Hikari firmly held his hand and avoided looking into his face as he composed himself. Her father had taught her that it was important to maintain dignity in vulnerable states. It was a lesson all his children were forced to learn after their mother's death. When Shinji's breathing evened out Hikari looked up into his tear streaked face and asked him "Are you okay now?"  
光看着真嗣继续哭泣，心中疑惑那些话是否属实。他的啜泣声渐渐减弱，但过了好几分钟泪水才完全止住。光紧紧握住他的手，避免直视他的脸，让他平复情绪。她的父亲曾教导她，在脆弱时刻保持尊严至关重要。这是母亲去世后，他们所有孩子都必须学会的一课。当真嗣的呼吸平稳下来，光抬头望向他泪痕斑斑的脸，轻声问道：“你现在还好吗？”

Shinji shook his head. "I-I'm sorry," he said and nothing more.  
真嗣摇了摇头。“我……对不起。”他只说了这么一句。

"It's alright," said Hikari. The two of them were silent for several seconds. "Let me take you to the bathroom so you can get cleaned up."  
“没关系，”光安慰道。两人沉默了片刻。“我带你去洗手间，整理一下吧。”

Shinji shook his head in protest and mumbled something about needing to go. Hikari said nothing and lead him down the hallway by hand. She stopped briefly to grab a rag and a towel from a nearby closet. When they reached the bathroom Hikari filled the sink with hot water and handed Shinji the rag.  
真嗣摇头抗议，嘴里咕哝着需要离开。光子一言不发，牵着他的手带他走过走廊。她停下来从附近的壁橱里拿了块抹布和毛巾。到达浴室后，光子往水槽里注满热水，递给真嗣抹布。

"I'll just wait outside," she said quietly. She closed the door behind her as she left the bathroom and leaned against the opposite wall. Her breathing was deep and deliberate as the minutes ticked by and she wondered why something always went wrong with everyone. Still she knew that Shinji would be okay because she was there to take care of him. She too would be fine because she had someone to take care of.  
“我就在外面等着。”她轻声说道。离开浴室时，她关上门，靠在对面的墙上。随着时间的流逝，她的呼吸深沉而有意识，她不禁思索为何总有什么事对每个人都出错。尽管如此，她知道真嗣会没事的，因为她在这里照顾他。她也会安然无恙，因为她有人可以照顾。

When Shinji exited the bathroom Hikari dispelled any visable signs of doubt and doned a mask of calm sympathy. Shinji's eyes were still red, but his face looked a lot cleaner. Though clearly anxious, he no longer seemed wild. Hikari was glad she allowed him to compose himself. He was now ready for civilized conversation.  
当真嗣走出浴室时，光子驱散了任何可见的疑虑，戴上了平静同情的面具。真嗣的眼睛依旧红肿，但他的脸看起来干净多了。尽管明显焦虑，他不再显得狂乱。光子很高兴她允许他整理自己。现在，他已准备好进行文明的对话。

"Thank you," he said awkwardly, not meeting her eyes. "I really... I have to go now."  
"谢谢你，" 他尴尬地说，没有直视她的眼睛。"我真的...我现在得走了。"

His hands were shaking at his sides as he spoke. Hikari took one of them into her own and led him to the kitchen. Despite his earlier statement, he sat when she pulled out a chair for him. Hikari watched his face closely as she pulled another tea cup from the cupboard and poured him a serving. With a shaking hand Shinji grabbed the cup and drank. Hikari felt a wave of pitty overtake her. No one should be so docile.  
他说话时双手在身侧颤抖。光握住其中一只手，带他走进厨房。尽管他之前说要走，但在她拉出椅子时，他还是坐下了。光仔细观察着他的脸，从橱柜里拿出另一个茶杯，为他倒了一杯茶。真嗣颤抖着手拿起杯子喝了一口。光感到一阵同情涌上心头。没有人应该如此顺从。

"Shinji, What's wrong?" "真嗣，怎么了？"

For a second it seemed as if he'd start to cry again. But then his lips formed into a familiar self-depreciating smile. "I looked everywhere," he said blandly. "Everywhere I could think of and she's not there."  
有那么一瞬间，他似乎又要哭了。但随即，他的嘴角勾起了一个熟悉的自我贬低的微笑。“我找遍了，”他平淡地说，“我能想到的所有地方，她都不在。”

"Who are you looking for?" Hikari asked. "Ms. Katsuragi?"  
“你在找谁？”光问，“桂木小姐吗？”

"No," said Shinji shaking his head emphatically. "Asuka."  
“不，”真嗣用力摇头，“我在找明日香。”

Hikari could not stop the gasp that escaped her lips. She raised a hand to her mouth and reeled in shock.  
光无法抑制地倒抽了一口气。她举手掩口，震惊得踉跄后退。

"But Asuka's in the hospital. Where would she go?"  
“但明日香在医院里。她能去哪儿？”

"I don't know..." said Shinji pitifully.  
“我不知道……”真嗣可怜兮兮地说。

"But why would she leave?" asked Hikari hurriedly as if each word could not wait for the other to leave her mouth. "You said she was getting better..."  
"但她为什么要离开呢？" 光急切地问道，仿佛每个字都迫不及待地要离开她的嘴。"你说过她正在好转..."

"They said she was... but she's gone now." Shinji lowered his head into his hands. "And everything she said... I should have known this would happen!"  
"他们说她...但她现在已经走了。" 真嗣将头埋进双手中。"而且她说的那些话...我早该知道会发生这种事！"

"It's not your fault," said Hikari patting him lightly on the shoulder. But she stopped as an awful thought occurred to her. Her eyes widened in renewed fear. "Oh my god Shinji, what if she has another seizure?"  
"这不是你的错，" 光轻轻拍了拍他的肩膀安慰道。但她突然停了下来，一个可怕的念头闪过脑海。她的眼睛因重新涌起的恐惧而睁大。"哦，天哪，真嗣，万一她又发作了怎么办？"

Shinji stared at her as if she'd just suggested that Asuka would grow a tail. Hikari felt as if something broke inside her. Asuka wasn't just going to suddenly be okay one day, Her father and Nozomi were as good as dead, and Kodama could barely stand to be around her because of how much she reminded her of their mutual losses. She couldn't help Shinji feel better about anything because she couldn't do anything to change the world. She couldn't stop a seizure, she couldn't stop another impact from coming out of the blue, and she couldn't stop death.  
真嗣盯着她，仿佛她刚刚提议明日香会长出尾巴一样。光感觉内心有什么东西破碎了。明日香不会突然有一天就好起来的，她的父亲和望美已经算是死了，而儿玉几乎无法忍受在她身边，因为她让她想起了他们的共同损失。她无法帮助真嗣感觉好些，因为她无法改变这个世界。她无法阻止癫痫发作，无法阻止另一次突如其来的冲击，也无法阻止死亡。

Hikari looked up at Shinji through clouded eyes as he patted her awkwardly on the back. A strange role reversal had occurred. Hikari was the sad and inconsolable one and Shinji was her comforter. Only... he was awful at it. Hikari began to sob harder. This was wrong.  
光透过朦胧的眼睛抬头看着真嗣，他尴尬地拍着她的背。角色发生了奇怪的颠倒。光成了那个悲伤且无法安慰的人，而真嗣成了安慰她的人。只是……他做得糟透了。光开始更厉害地哭泣。这不对劲。

"She'll be okay," said Shinji, but he sounded uncertain and scared. "She won't have any seizures."  
“她会没事的，”真嗣说，但他的声音听起来既不确定又害怕。“她不会再有癫痫发作了。”

"How do you know?" she asked. "Anything could happen..."  
"你怎么知道？" 她问道。"什么事情都可能发生..."

"She can't have seizures," said Shinji suddenly sounding more resolute. "She's never had a seizure before. So don't cry..."  
"她不可能有癫痫，" 真嗣突然坚定地说道。"她以前从未发作过。所以别哭了..."

Hikari managed to bring herself under some semblance of control. Shinji's words had done little to console her. She was now fully and utterly confused.  
光终于设法让自己稍微平静了一些。真嗣的话并没有给她多少安慰。她现在完全彻底地感到困惑。

"What do you mean she's never had a seizure?"  
"你什么意思，她从没发作过？"

When it became apparent that he wouldn't answer, Hikari looked up from the table and into the face of a liar. Shinji looked like a mouse trapped in a corner. He quickly turned from her gaze.  
当意识到他不会回答时，光从桌子上抬起头，直视着一个说谎者的脸。真嗣看起来像一只被困在角落的老鼠。他迅速避开了她的目光。

"I... I just didn't want to be sad."  
"我...我只是不想难过。"

"Shinji?" Hikari asked. "What are you trying to say?"  
"真嗣？" 光问道。"你想说什么？"

"I'm sorry," said Shinji staring into his dark tea. "It's just... I feel bad. I feel bad almost all the time. But when I talked to you... I don't know... I felt a little bit better."  
"对不起，" 真嗣盯着他那杯深色的茶说道。"只是... 我感到很难过。几乎无时无刻不感到难过。但当我跟你说话时... 我不知道... 我感觉好了一点。"

"So was any of it true?" Hikari was shocked by the edge in her own voice, but she only felt angrier when Shinji apologized again. For a while there was silence. Hikari couldn't wrap her mind around the situation properly. Shinji had lied to her and betrayed her trust just to make himself feel better. She understood that. But he completely disregarded her feelings. And now when things were really bad he had the nerve to come to her house and ask her for help?  
"那么那些话有几分是真的？" 光被自己声音中的尖锐震惊了，但当真嗣再次道歉时，她只感到更加愤怒。一时间，两人陷入了沉默。光无法完全理解这个情况。真嗣为了让自己感觉好些而对她撒谎，背叛了她的信任。她明白这一点。但他完全忽视了她的感受。而现在，当事情变得真正糟糕时，他竟然有胆量来到她家向她求助？

"I'm awful..." said Shinji with all the self-pity in the world. Hikari clenched her hands into fists. How dare he play the victim? For the first time since the impact Hikari felt the desire to do physical harm to someone, but she hated feeling this way. She hated being angry because anger accomplished nothing. And she hated being depressed because that didn't solve anything either. But there was Shinji with his sloppy posture and shadowy eyelids practically begging her to feel sorry for him and show compassion, forcing his problems onto her. But this time she just couldn't give a damn for his sad little sob story. She didn't have to take this.  
"我真是糟糕透顶..." 真嗣带着满腔的自怨自艾说道。光子紧握双拳，他怎么敢扮演受害者？自从那次冲击以来，光子第一次产生了对某人施以肉体伤害的冲动，但她讨厌这种感觉。她讨厌愤怒，因为愤怒无济于事。她也讨厌抑郁，因为那同样解决不了任何问题。但真嗣那副邋遢的坐姿和阴沉的眼睑，几乎是在乞求她同情，将他的烦恼强加给她。但这一次，她真的不在乎他那可怜兮兮的哭诉了。她不必忍受这些。

"Get out of my house," she said, her voice shaking with every word.  
"滚出我的房子，" 她一字一顿地说，声音因激动而颤抖。

Shinji stared at her in shocked disbelief.  
真嗣难以置信地盯着她，震惊不已。

"Get out!" she yelled and he hastily pulled away from her apologizing profusely. He sounded quite pathetic in his need for her forgiveness, but as far as she was concerned Shinji didn't exist anymore.  
"滚出去！" 她大喊道，他急忙从她身边退开，连声道歉。他的声音听起来相当可怜，迫切需要她的原谅，但在她看来，真嗣已经不存在了。

Hikari saw the kitchen table with the two table settings. She heard footsteps growing fainter and fainter. The door opened and closed audibly and Hikari felt her rapid breathing began to slow. She took a sip of her tea, but instantly regretted it. She was in no mood for it now. Some of it's contents spilled on the table as she set the cup down harder than she intended. She hastily set the cup in the sink and cleaned up the minor mess she had made.  
光看到厨房桌上有两套餐具。她听到脚步声越来越远，越来越轻。门开了又关，声音清晰可闻，光感到自己急促的呼吸开始放缓。她抿了一口茶，但立刻就后悔了。现在她根本没心情喝茶。杯子放下时比她预想的要重，一些茶水洒在了桌上。她匆忙将杯子放进水槽，并清理了自己造成的这个小混乱。

"I lost control," she said to no one in particular as she wiped the table with a rag. She liked to talk to herself sometimes. It was the easiest way to sort out her thoughts when alone. "What Shinji did was wrong... but I shouldn't have lost control."  
"我失控了，" 她对着空无一人的房间说道，一边用抹布擦着桌子。她有时喜欢自言自语，这是独自一人时整理思绪最简单的方法。"真嗣做的事是错的……但我也不该失控。"

Hikari felt a little uneasy. She wished that maybe she had given Shinji a better chance to explain. She wouldn't have forgiven him, not so quickly anyways, but perhaps she could have found out more about what was really wrong with Asuka. Maybe she could have helped.  
光感觉到一丝不安。她希望自己或许给了真嗣一个更好的机会来解释。她不会那么快原谅他，无论如何都不会，但也许她能了解更多关于明日香真正的问题所在。或许她能帮上忙。

"Water under the bridge," said Hikari. But she laughed at herself because she knew it wasn't true. Her left hand was still balled into a fist. She finally released it.  
“过去的事就让它过去吧，”光说。但她自嘲地笑了，因为她知道这不是真的。她的左手仍然紧握成拳。她终于松开了它。

Hikari suddenly felt extremely tired and very much alone. She headed into the living room and decided to call her sister. She pulled the curtains back slightly with one hand and used the other hand to dial as she looked out the window. It wasn't that she really expected to see anyone out there. She didn't expect Shinji to hang around after that confrontation and it wasn't as if she'd somehow stumble upon Asuka. The phone rang insistently in her ears until…  
光突然感到极度疲惫和非常孤独。她走进客厅，决定给姐姐打电话。她用一只手轻轻拉开窗帘，另一只手拨号，同时望向窗外。她并不是真的期待能看到谁在外面。她不认为真嗣会在那次对峙后逗留，而且她也不可能偶然遇到明日香。电话在她耳边不停地响着，直到……

"Hi, this is Kodama. I'm not in right now but leave me a message and I'll get back to you. Ciao!"  
“嗨，我是儿玉。我现在不在，请留言，我会回电的。再见！”

Hikari hung up the phone with a sigh. Her arms wrapped around herself in a hug. It wasn't comforting, but it was a little bit better. Things would be bad for a little while, but they'd been worse before. Hikari would make it through this night and anything else that came along with it. After all, she couldn't take care of other people if she didn't know how to take care of herself.  
光叹了口气挂断电话，双臂环抱自己，虽然并不安慰，但感觉稍好一些。事情会糟糕一阵子，但以前更糟过。光会度过这个夜晚，以及随之而来的任何事情。毕竟，如果她不知道如何照顾自己，就无法照顾其他人。

---

After the impact the future of NERV was uncertain. Publicly they were classified as a federally funded biological research facility. Their goal had always been to progressively increase technology to further the function and survival of mankind. Many things had changed since the third impact occurred, but that was one thing that the survivors of the company felt should not.  
冲击之后，NERV 的未来变得不确定。公开身份下，他们被归类为联邦资助的生物研究机构。他们的目标始终是不断推进技术，以促进人类的功能和生存。自第三次冲击发生以来，许多事情都发生了变化，但公司幸存者认为这一点不应改变。

The Japanese government (when there were enough people back to warrant a Japanese government) were surprisingly lenient with pardons and reparations. After the conclusion of a year long investigation almost everyone within the company were cleared of the charges of treason and genocide. Those who did not receive pardon had not returned from the sea of souls, for the most part. The core of the company was not held responsible for the sins of its head. They were given a clean slate to start anew.  
日本政府（当足够多的人回归，足以形成一个日本政府时）在赦免和赔偿方面出奇地宽容。经过长达一年的调查后，公司内几乎所有人都被免除了叛国和种族灭绝的指控。那些未获赦免的人大多没有从灵魂之海归来。公司的核心成员并未因其领导者的罪行而受到追究。他们获得了一个全新的开始，一切从头再来。

About a year and a half after she returned from the sea, Misato and all the other high ranking officials from NERV branches across the world held a lengthy meeting to decide the fate of the company. After days of deliberation and debate, key decisions were made. The branches would split off from each other. Each branch would undergo a name change and sign a non-competition agreement among all the other branches. Any scientific discoveries found in one branch would be made available to the others within 2 years of discovery.  
在她从灵魂之海归来大约一年半后，美里和世界各地 NERV 分支的所有高级官员举行了一次长时间的会议，以决定公司的命运。经过数天的审议和辩论，做出了关键决策。各分支将相互分离。每个分支都将更名，并与其他分支签署非竞争协议。任何分支的科学发现将在发现后的两年内向其他分支公开。

Some branches continued to focus on weaponry and defensive technology. Others, like the American branch, chose to research new energy sources. Particularly the potential use of the S2 engine in a commercial power grid. NERV Japan, always having specialized in biomimetics, renamed itself Gherin Technologies and focused its energy toward the production and sales of high-function synthetic body parts.  
一些分支机构继续专注于武器和防御技术。另一些，如美国分支，选择研究新能源。特别是 S2 引擎在商业电网中的潜在应用。NERV 日本，一直专长于仿生学，更名为 Gherin 科技，将其精力转向高性能合成身体部件的生产和销售。

Gherin Technologies utilized the data recorded from project EVA to create living prosthetic body parts in order to aid those who have been injured and lost limbs. How this process worked was always somewhat of a mystery to Misato, who had almost no biological background whatsoever, unless you counted that sprint anatomy course she took with Kaji in college (but the university refused to give them credit for that). From what she could gather an arm or a leg was grown from some cell somehow and hooked up to the patient some way. From there some kind of synchronization process took place which somehow allowed the patient to move the limb to some degree. It was a very scientific process that was far from perfect.  
Gherin 科技利用从 EVA 项目记录的数据，创造出活的假体身体部件，以帮助那些受伤并失去肢体的人。这个过程对 Misato 来说总有些神秘，她几乎没有生物学背景，除非你算上大学时和 Kaji 一起上的那门解剖学速成课（但大学拒绝给他们这门课的学分）。据她所知，手臂或腿是从某种细胞中生长出来的，并以某种方式连接到患者身上。之后，某种同步过程发生，使患者能够在一定程度上移动肢体。这是一个非常科学的流程，远未臻完美。

So far there had been no success with replacing complicated sensory organs such as the eyes or eardrums. The synchronization ratio is just too low. 100 percent synchronization had never been achieved with any transplant. 89 percent was the highest synchronization ratio achieved so far. The 10 year old girl who managed it said it was almost exactly like having her old arm back. She was quite happy. Cute kid too. So even if Misato didn't understand exactly what it was her people did to make it all work, she was glad to help them do it.  
到目前为止，替换眼睛或耳膜这样复杂的感官器官尚未取得成功。同步率实在太低。从未有过任何移植手术能达到 100%的同步率。迄今为止最高的同步率是 89%。那位成功实现这一同步率的 10 岁女孩说，这几乎就像重新拥有了她的旧手臂一样。她非常高兴。这孩子也很可爱。所以即使 Misato 并不完全明白她的团队是如何让这一切运作的，但她很高兴能帮助他们实现这一目标。

As directer of Gherin Technologies, Misato had few duties that directly corresponded with the work done there. Her main responsibilities involved lots of paperwork, most of which consisted of requests for government funding. When she wasn't formally begging the Japanese government for spare scraps of cash, she was informally begging them for it during the various unscheduled inspections and progress assessments. Her only other duty was to hire staff.  
作为 Gherin Technologies 的总监，Misato 的职责与那里的工作直接相关的并不多。她的主要职责涉及大量文书工作，其中大部分是向政府申请资金。当她不在正式地向日本政府乞求零星的资金时，她就在各种非正式的检查和进度评估中非正式地向他们乞求。她的另一项职责是招聘员工。

Misato tried her best to secure jobs for as many former NERV employees as she could but it was impossible to keep everyone. A private research company had little use for its own secret service, but she did manage to line up security jobs for the more distinguished Section 2 members. Still, not everyone who worked for NERV wanted their old jobs back. Maya, who was perhaps the most brilliant biotechnologist left in the company after Ritsuko's death, respectfully declined the position for head of research. No thank you, she said. She had seen enough to last a lifetime. Misato heard from Aoba that she went back to college to study clinical medicine, which he claimed was a complete waste of her talents. Misato was saddened by the loss because neither he nor Makoto were really fit to fill her shoes. Still she didn't really blame Maya. A former member of the German branch of NERV took the job instead. He was the quiet nerdy type of man that was completely dedicated to his work. While Misato was used to that type of person, he had none of the redeeming qualities held by someone like Ritsuko. That is to say, he had no discernible personality. But at least he was good at what he did.  
美里竭尽全力为尽可能多的前 NERV 员工争取工作机会，但无法让所有人都留下。一家私人研究公司对自身的秘密服务需求甚少，不过她确实设法为更杰出的第二分部成员安排了安保职位。然而，并非所有曾在 NERV 工作的人都希望重返旧职。在律子去世后，或许是公司内最杰出的生物技术专家的玛雅，婉拒了研究部门主管的职位。她表示，已经见识够了，不想再继续。美里从青叶那里得知，玛雅重返大学攻读临床医学，青叶认为这完全浪费了她的才华。美里为此感到惋惜，因为无论是青叶还是真嗣，都无法真正填补她的空缺。但她并未真正责怪玛雅。最终，一位来自 NERV 德国分部的成员接手了这份工作。他是个沉默寡言、专注于工作的书呆子型人物。虽然美里习惯于这种类型的人，但他完全没有律子那样的可取之处，也就是说，他缺乏明显的个性。但至少他在专业领域表现出色。

Everyone was good at what they did, really. It was why Misato liked being at work. Errors were rare and usually fixable. There was almost always something that she could do. When she was there, she felt useful. She'd spent the last 5 hours catching up on her paper work and she was finally finished. Now she was observing Makoto at work.  
每个人都很擅长自己的工作，真的。这就是美里喜欢上班的原因。错误很少见，而且通常都能修正。她总能找到可以做的事情。在那里，她感到自己有用。她花了最后 5 个小时赶完了文书工作，终于完成了。现在她在观察真琴工作。

Standing behind him at his desk she placed a hand on his shoulder and asked, "How is it coming along?" She felt it was her duty to establish a friendly and encouraging work environment. She could not understand Gendo's way of running things. There was no reason to instill fear when you already had your colleagues respect.  
站在他的桌子后面，她把手放在他的肩膀上问道：“进展如何？”她觉得营造一个友好和鼓励的工作环境是她的职责。她无法理解源堂的做事方式。当你已经赢得了同事的尊重时，没有理由再制造恐惧。

Makoto adjusted his glasses and glanced at her briefly from behind them before returning his eyes to the data sheets he was looking over. "It's going fine. Just finishing up some statistical odds and ends."  
真琴调整了一下眼镜，从镜片后短暂地看了她一眼，然后又把目光转回到他正在查看的数据表上。“进展顺利。只是在做一些统计上的收尾工作。”

"Oh?" asked Misato giving his shoulder a light squeeze. They'd always gotten along rather well. "Sounds pretty boring and tedious to me."  
"哦？" 美里轻轻捏了捏他的肩膀，他们一直相处得相当不错。"听起来挺无聊又乏味的。"

Makoto chuckled. "I'd be lying if I said it was interesting. Just averages and standard deviations. Nothing for the Chief Director to worry about."  
真琴轻笑道："如果我说这很有趣，那我就是在撒谎。不过是平均数和标准差罢了。不值得总监操心。"

Misato felt herself smiling despite being unamused. She knew that this was supposed to be typical office banter. The type of comment one throws out purely for the purpose of being forgotten. But something about his words irked her. She absentmindedly forgot to move her hand.  
美里尽管感到无趣，却还是不由自主地笑了。她知道这本应是典型的办公室闲聊，那种纯粹为了被遗忘而抛出的评论。但他的话不知怎的让她感到不快。她心不在焉地忘了把手移开。

"I'll be done pretty soon," said Makoto after a moment. "I just have to enter the data into the computer is all. You can leave if you want to."  
"我很快就好了，" 真琴过了一会儿说道，"只是要把数据输入电脑而已。如果你想走的话可以先走。"

If Misato had found his words annoying before, they now felt alien and unnerving. Most likely he was trying to save her the boredom of watching over him, but it was as if she was being dismissed. She made no move to leave. She didn't even move her hand from his shoulder. She was the boss. It was her job to be there. There was no reason for her to leave. And even if there was, what would she leave to?  
如果之前 Misato 觉得他的话令人烦躁，现在则感到陌生且不安。他很可能只是想让她免于看着他的无聊，但这感觉就像是在被赶走。她没有离开的打算，甚至没有从他的肩膀上移开手。她是老板，在场是她的职责。没有理由离开。即便有，她又能去哪儿呢？

"I don't mind staying a little longer," she said placing her other hand on his other shoulder. She felt Makoto tense and reminded herself how well the two of them got along. "What are you doing after work?" she asked. The words felt strange coming out of her mouth. She almost wanted to take them back.  
"我不介意多待一会儿，" 她说着，将另一只手放在他的另一个肩膀上。她感觉到真琴紧张起来，提醒自己他们俩相处得有多好。"下班后你打算做什么？" 她问道。这些话从她嘴里说出来感觉很奇怪，她几乎想把它们收回去。

Makoto laughed. Nervously. It was an odd sound.  
真琴笑了。紧张地。那是一种奇怪的声音。

"I'm just going home, Ms. Katsuragi. It's already pretty late." His speech was oddly formal.  
"我只是回家，葛城小姐。已经很晚了。" 他的话语出奇地正式。

"Are you sure you don't want to do something else?" asked Misato and she was really beginning to hate her own word choice. It wasn't supposed to sound so forward. She needed to amend herself. "Like grabbing some drinks?" she asked and then regretted that too. She didn't want to drink alcohol because if she started she wasn't sure that she could stop. But maybe if she asked Makoto nicely, he'd stop her from drinking too much before anything bad happened. Maybe she'd listen to him too, because they always got along pretty well. She began to massage his shoulders. _I wonder how well we'll get along tonight_ - but that thought didn't even feel remotely right.  
"你确定不想做点别的吗？" 美里问道，她开始讨厌自己的措辞。这本不该听起来如此直白。她需要修正自己。"比如喝点饮料？" 她问，随后又后悔了。她并不想喝酒，因为一旦开始，她不确定自己能否停下来。但如果她友好地邀请真琴，也许他会阻止她喝得太多，以免发生不好的事。也许她也会听他的，因为他们一直相处得很好。她开始按摩他的肩膀。不知道今晚我们能相处得多好——但这个念头甚至感觉一点都不对劲。

"I wish I could but," said Makoto chuckling oddly again, "but I have to get home." Was this funny to him? It wasn't remotely funny to her.  
"我希望我能留下，但是，" 真琴再次奇怪地笑了笑，"但我得回家了。" 这对他来说有趣吗？对她来说一点也不好笑。

"Can't you be home a little later tonight?" Misato asked in a low pleading tone. It disgusted her what she was doing with her voice. She shouldn't have to beg this way to hang out with... a friend? A fellow worker?... it didn't really matter. He was Makoto. It shouldn't have been so difficult.  
"今晚你就不能晚点回家吗？" 美里用低沉而恳求的语气问道。她对自己用声音这样做感到恶心。她不应该这样乞求才能和...一个朋友？一个同事？...其实并不重要。他是真琴。这本不该如此困难。

"Sorry Ms. Katsuragi but I should really get back." he said. "My girlfriend will worry."  
"抱歉，葛城小姐，但我真的该回去了。" 他说，"我女朋友会担心的。"

"Oh," said Misato. She withdrew her hands slowly, but maintained her distance behind him. "Okay... I don't see why..." But she cut herself off. She was going to say, _I don't see why you can't call her and let her know you're hanging out with an old friend,_ but luckily she stopped herself. She couldn't beg him to have drinks with her, because they weren't old friends. They got along well at work because they barely had to get along at all. He might have had a crush on her years ago, but now they hardly saw each other in a social capacity. He was her employee and nothing more. So Misato stood in silence as Makoto began to type again.  
“哦，”美里说道。她缓缓收回双手，但仍保持在他身后的一定距离。“好吧……我不明白为什么……”但她突然打住了。她本想说，我不明白你为什么不能给她打个电话，告诉她你和一个老朋友出去玩，但幸好她及时止住了。她不能求他一起喝酒，因为他们并非老朋友。他们在工作中相处得很好，只是因为几乎不需要真正相处。他多年前可能对她有过好感，但现在他们几乎在社交场合见不到面。他是她的员工，仅此而已。于是美里沉默地站在那里，看着真琴又开始打字。

This was pathetic. She was pathetic because this was how she needed to behave. Tears began to well up in her eyes and she blinked them away. She wouldn't cry there leaning so close to her subordinate because she was the boss. There at Gherin she was strong and unwavering. She did her job, she did it well, and nothing outside of that reality existed.  
这太可悲了。她之所以可悲，是因为她需要这样表现。泪水开始在她的眼眶中打转，她眨眼将其逼退。她不会在那里，靠得那么近对着下属哭泣，因为她是老板。在 Gherin，她是坚强且坚定的。她做好了自己的工作，做得很好，除此之外的现实都不存在。

Minutes passed and the sound of typing ceased. Makoto was looking up at her but she refused to look at him. She continued to stare at his screen.  
几分钟过去了，打字声停止了。真琴抬头看着她，但她拒绝回望。她继续盯着他的屏幕。

"You look tired Misato," he said tentatively. "Why don't you go home? There's nothing to do here tonight."  
"你看起来很疲惫，美里，" 他试探性地说道，"为什么不回家呢？今晚这里没什么事要做。"

Misato stared at Makoto's computer monitor and ignored the moisture rolling down her cheeks. She breathed deeply for several long moments until her body was under control. In the calmest tone she could muster she said, "I do not want to go home right now, Mr. Hyuga." Now she was the formal one.  
美里盯着真嗣的电脑屏幕，无视着从脸颊滚落的泪水。她深呼吸了好几下，直到身体恢复了控制。她用尽可能平静的语气说道："我现在不想回家，日向先生。" 现在她变得正式起来。

"Okay," he said quietly. For a moment he sat there looking at her. Then he turned around in his chair and opened a new window on his computer.  
"好吧，" 他轻声说道。他坐在那里看了她一会儿，然后转过椅子，在电脑上打开了一个新窗口。

"I... I just realized something."  
"我...我刚刚意识到一件事。"

"What's that?" asked Misato.  
"什么事？" 美里问道。"

"They're going to be testing the new heart synchronization process tomorrow and I still have some data to analyze from the tests they did last week." Makoto looked up at her and smiled weakly. "I guess this is going to be a long night for me..."  
"他们明天要测试新的心脏同步过程，而我还有上周测试的一些数据需要分析。" 真琴抬头看着她，无力地笑了笑。"看来今晚对我来说会是个漫长的夜晚..."

Misato felt the tension ease, if only a little bit.  
美里感觉到紧张气氛稍稍缓和了一些。

"I guess so, Makoto," she said. But she really meant thank you.  
“我想是的，真琴，”她说道。但其实她真正想说的是谢谢你。

---

Shinji sat with his forehead pressed against the glass. His eyes were glistening. He hadn't been crying but he felt like he could. It felt like he should be. He told himself that he was looking for Asuka, but his heart wasn't in it anymore. Somewhere along the line his brain caught up to his body and he finally realized that Misato was right. He would not find Asuka if she didn't want to be found. He was just wasting his time.  
真嗣额头抵着玻璃坐着，眼中闪烁着泪光。他并没有在哭，但感觉自己快要哭了。他觉得自己应该哭。他告诉自己是在寻找明日香，但他的心已经不在那里了。不知何时，他的大脑跟上了身体，他终于意识到美里是对的。如果明日香不想被找到，他是找不到她的。他只是在浪费时间。

So then why was he out here riding the Tokyo loop line, eyes widening in anticipation at any small glimpse of red, only to be disappointed every single time? Did he know it was stupid? Yes. Did he want to be stupid? No. Was he that desperate? Yes. And did it even matter? That one he didn't have the answer to. But there were more unanswerable questions where that came from.  
那么，他为何还在这儿乘坐东京环线，每当瞥见一丝红色便满怀期待地瞪大眼睛，却每次都失望而归？他明知这很愚蠢吗？是的。他愿意犯傻吗？不。他是否已如此绝望？是的。这一切还重要吗？这个问题他无从解答。但还有更多无法回答的问题接踵而至。

Asuka could be dead. She could be somewhere cold and dark lying down on the ground dead. Someone slit her throat. She fell from a two story building. She drowned in someone's swimming pool. It's all possible. Maybe she's dead.  
明日香可能已经死了。她可能躺在某个冰冷黑暗的地方，静静地死去。有人割断了她的喉咙。她从两层楼高的地方坠落。她在某人的游泳池里溺亡。这些都有可能。或许她真的已经死了。

Some pervert could be with her right now. He grabs her arm. She screams for him to stop, but he doesn't. She screams out his name. Shinji, she yells. Calls out for him to help her. But he's not there. And the man continues. He rips her shirt. He knocks her to the ground. She yells and she yells but no one comes. His hands are all over her and - _stop -_ he's taking off her clothes as she struggles to hit him and tries to get him off but - _stop! -_ she can't do a thing and then he brings out a knife and tells her that if she doesn't stop moving he'll give her a new breathing hole and - _stop it!_... _seriously that's enough..._ - and finish what he started afterward and...  
某个变态可能现在正和她在一起。他抓住她的手臂。她尖叫着让他停下，但他没有。她喊出了他的名字。真嗣，她大喊。呼唤他来救她。但他不在那里。而那个男人继续着。他撕破了她的衬衫。他将她击倒在地。她不停地尖叫，但没有人来。他的手在她身上游走，而——停下——他正脱掉她的衣服，她挣扎着打他，试图让他离开，但——停下！——她什么也做不了，然后他拿出一把刀，告诉她如果她不停下来，他就会给她开个新的呼吸孔，然后——住手！……说真的，够了……——然后完成他开始的事情，然后……

_God what would I do if she's dead?  
天啊，如果她死了，我该怎么办？_

Shinji didn't know if he could live without her. Somehow he had managed to place all his hopes and dreams into one single person and now that person was being taken away. The prospect left him surprisingly numb. If Asuka was dead would he die too? And more importantly, when did he become so weak and dependent?  
真嗣不知道如果没有她，他是否还能活下去。不知怎么的，他设法将所有的希望和梦想寄托在一个人身上，而现在那个人正在被夺走。这个前景让他感到出奇的麻木。如果明日香死了，他也会死吗？更重要的是，他什么时候变得如此软弱和依赖？

It went back to the beach where he found her and his hands were fast around her neck. _I don't want to think about that -_ but he wasn't in his right mind and he didn't know what he was doing but she touched him and he stopped. She said she felt sick. Did he make her sick? He didn't know. But that's where it started. On the beach.  
他们回到了他找到她的那片海滩，他的双手紧紧掐住她的脖子。我不想去想这些——但他当时神志不清，不知道自己在做什么，然而她触碰了他，他便停下了。她说她感到恶心。是他让她生病的吗？他不知道。但一切就是从那片海滩开始的。

It was just the two of them, for much too long. And it was a full day before they were in a good enough state of mind to start looking for food. They wandered into the city where there were plenty of canned goods, and they stayed there for a while. Until he got scared. Scared of all the nobodies who weren't around anywhere. The city was too quiet, too big, and too empty.  
很长一段时间里，只有他们两个人。直到整整一天后，他们才恢复到足够清醒的状态去寻找食物。他们走进城市，那里有许多罐头食品，他们在那里停留了一阵子。直到他感到害怕。害怕那些无处不在的、不存在的人。城市太过寂静，太过庞大，也太过空旷。

So they started living on the beach and taking their food to go. Their lives consisted merely of food and each other. There was nothing else. _Just Shinji and Asuka and nothing else but Shinji and Asuka and nothing else but..._ Somehow even though she was there it felt as if she really wasn't.  
于是他们开始在海滩上生活，带着食物四处走动。他们的生活仅由食物和彼此构成。除此之外别无他物。只有真嗣和明日香，除了真嗣和明日香之外别无他物，除了……尽管她就在那里，却感觉她仿佛真的不在。

Asuka talked to him sometimes. Always at night. She told him that she was confused. That she didn't understand a lot of things, but there was one thing she did understand: She didn't want to die. She ate the canned foods and she drank the bottled water and slept under the tents because she wanted to live. But there was nothing else that she wanted to do. Could the purpose of her life simply be mere existence? Was that enough?  
明日香有时会和他交谈。总是在夜晚。她告诉他她感到困惑。她不明白很多事情，但有一件事她确实明白：她不想死。她吃罐头食品，喝瓶装水，睡在帐篷下，因为她想活下去。但除此之外，她别无所求。难道她生命的意义仅仅是生存吗？这足够了吗？

She used to have goals, she told him. (He pretended not to hear her because the one time he did respond back to her she stopped talking and she didn't say anything again for a while.) But she told him later that she didn't like her goals anymore. In fact, she hated them. Hated everything about them. Her goals where shallow and weak. She was shallow and weak. And the worst part was she couldn't tell anybody. She couldn't even tell Shinji, who she was currently telling, because in the morning they'd both pretend like it never happened. But it was a good thing that he never said anything back to her and that they pretended that it never happened because if he ever mentioned any of this aloud she would kill him. _ha ha._ And then she'd kill herself. From the embarrassment. It's a joke. It's okay to laugh. But Shinji never did.  
她曾告诉他，自己有过目标。（他假装没听见，因为有一次他回应了她，她就闭嘴了，好一阵子都没再说话。）但后来她告诉他，她不再喜欢那些目标了。实际上，她恨它们。恨关于它们的一切。她的目标肤浅而脆弱。她自己也是。最糟糕的是，她无法向任何人倾诉。甚至无法告诉眼前这位，因为到了早晨，他们都会假装这一切从未发生。但幸好他从未回应过她，他们也假装一切如常，因为如果他敢大声提起这些事，她会杀了他。哈哈。然后她会自杀。因为羞愧。这是个笑话。可以笑的。但真嗣从未笑过。

She told him once that she used to be so serious but she didn't even know why she was serious. Why did she wear her pride like armor? Why did she let every little chip in her pride hurt her? Why didn't she just learn to take it? Other people took it without a problem. People she looked down on. People she despised. They took the pain and the injustice and carried it with them like a backpack. But she couldn't have that. She wasn't as strong as them. She couldn't carry the load and she damned well couldn't share it. But now... now she doesn't know. Maybe she could have carried a little more than she did. Maybe she could have carried just as much as everyone else. Only she never tried.  
她曾告诉他，自己过去总是那么严肃，却连为何如此严肃都不明白。为何她将自尊心当作盔甲穿戴？为何她让自尊心上的每一处裂痕都刺痛自己？为何她不学会接受呢？其他人都能毫无问题地承受。那些她瞧不起的人。那些她鄙视的人。他们承受着痛苦和不公，如同背负着背包。但她做不到。她没有他们那么坚强。她无法承担重负，更别提分享了。然而现在...现在她不确定了。或许她本可以承受更多。或许她能和别人一样多。只是她从未尝试过。

One time she laid down very close to him. And she put her mouth right by his ear. And she said, "If you tell me you love me, I'll give you anything you want. I will never leave you. And I will love you forever."  
有一次，她躺得离他非常近。她将嘴凑到他耳边，说道：“如果你告诉我你爱我，我会给你任何你想要的。我永远不会离开你。我会永远爱你。”

Shinji didn't say a word. He didn't say a single word and _it's all my fault_ because she needed him to say something and he didn't say a word. And when she realized that he would say nothing she laughed. _ha ha._ Just a joke, Shinji, just a joke. But she slept there like that, very close to him and he was glad she didn't move away.  
真嗣一句话也没说。他一个字都没说，这都是我的错，因为她需要他说些什么，而他却一言不发。当她意识到他什么也不会说时，她笑了。哈哈。只是个玩笑，真嗣，只是个玩笑。但她就这样睡在那里，离他很近，他很高兴她没有挪开。

In the morning Shinji said, "I love you." Asuka laughed and said, "Whatever." Shinji felt really really stupid. And then he felt really really mad. But after that he didn't know what to think because he knew if he'd said it just hours earlier it still would have been a complete lie, but it would have meant something completely real. But maybe in the morning light it was easier to see his words for what they really were at the time: a sham.  
早上，真嗣说：“我爱你。”明日香笑了，说：“随便吧。”真嗣觉得自己真的很蠢。然后他感到非常非常生气。但之后他不知道该怎么想，因为他知道如果他在几个小时前说这句话，那仍然会是一个彻头彻尾的谎言，但它会意味着完全真实的东西。但在晨光中，更容易看清他当时的话到底是什么：一个幌子。

He found the doll a few days later. It was lying on the ground in the middle of the street. He didn't know why, but he picked it up.  
几天后，他找到了那个娃娃。它躺在街道中央的地面上。他不知道为什么，但他把它捡了起来。

"What's that?" she asked. He told her it was a doll. It was a hand stitched doll wearing a blue dress with red yarn hair. _It was all my fault._  
“那是什么？”她问道。他告诉她那是个布娃娃。那是一个手工缝制的布娃娃，穿着蓝色裙子，头发是用红毛线做的。都是我的错。

Shinji told her, "It looks like you."  
“看起来像你。”真嗣告诉她。

Asuka reluctantly agreed. He took the doll with them back to camp. Set it down next to him. And Asuka looked over at the doll with the strangest expression on her face. She began to talk to him as she looked at the doll. It was the first time she'd said more than a few sentences during the day.  
明日香不情愿地同意了。他带着布娃娃和他们一起回到营地，把它放在他旁边。明日香看着布娃娃，脸上露出奇怪的表情。她开始对着布娃娃说话，这是她那天第一次说超过几句话。

"I used to hate dolls. Because they did anything you wanted them to do. They'd die if you wanted them to and they wouldn't even care. So I tried my hardest not to be a doll. I didn't listen to anyone I didn't want to. I didn't compromise for anything at all. But now..." she laughed bitterly. "I can't even get myself to do the things that _I_ want to do. I think it would be easier to be a doll." she said.  
"我以前讨厌娃娃。因为它们会做任何你想让它们做的事。你想让它们死，它们就会死，甚至不在乎。所以我尽全力不让自己成为那样的娃娃。我不听我不想听的人的话。我绝不妥协任何事。但现在..." 她苦笑道。"我甚至无法让自己去做我想做的事。我想，成为娃娃或许更容易些。" 她说。

And Shinji vehemently said, "No! It's not better to be a doll!" He slapped her and told her to never think that way again. That she had so much to live for. That all she had to do was try her hardest to be the type of person she wanted to be and then she'd be it. "I believe in you," he told her. And she came to her senses and realized her worth in this life.  
而真嗣坚决地说："不！成为娃娃并不好！" 他打了她一巴掌，告诉她再也不要那样想。她有很多活下去的理由。她只需要尽全力成为她想成为的那种人，就能做到。"我相信你，" 他告诉她。她终于清醒过来，意识到自己在这世上的价值。

_Ha ha._ That didn't happen. Just kidding. He said nothing. Asuka took the doll from beside Shinji and placed it next to herself. She patted the doll on the head and said. "Isn't that right, Little Asuka?"  
哈哈。那没发生。开玩笑的。他什么也没说。明日香从真嗣旁边拿过娃娃，放在自己身边。她拍了拍娃娃的头，说："对吧，小明日香？"

Shinji saw it happening but made no effort to stop it. The changes were so slow and natural that he felt no reason to object. Asuka couldn't talk to Shinji during the day, but Little Asuka could. Never directly, of course. She served as a medium between them.  
真嗣目睹了这一切，却未曾试图阻止。变化如此缓慢而自然，他找不到反对的理由。白天，明日香无法与真嗣交谈，但小明日香可以。当然，不是直接对话。她成了他们之间的媒介。

If Shinji asked, "Are you hungry?" Asuka would say, "Little Asuka and I are starving." If Shinji asked "How are you feeling?" Asuka would say that she was okay. At least she wasn't stuffed with cotton. It was a joke. They both enjoyed it. Shinji called her Little Asuka too.  
如果真嗣问，“你饿了吗？”明日香会说，“小明日香和我都饿坏了。”如果真嗣问“你感觉怎么样？”明日香会说她还好。至少她没有被棉花塞满。这是个笑话。他们俩都喜欢。真嗣也称她为小明日香。

But somewhere along the line the doll stopped being Little Asuka. The doll just became Asuka. Asuka the doll and Asuka the girl where inseparable.  
但不知何时，那个玩偶不再是小明日香了。玩偶就是明日香。玩偶明日香和女孩明日香变得密不可分。

"Asuka and I are going to use the bathroom. Asuka and I want to build a fire tonight. Me and Asuka are tired, Shinji, lets go to sleep." And even this seemed natural. Just the simple joke extended. Nothing strange there at all because when Asuka was with Asuka, Shinji could be with both of them in ways he never could before.  
"明日香和我去用洗手间。明日香和我今晚想生个火。我和明日香累了，真嗣，我们去睡觉吧。" 甚至连这种话都显得很自然。只是简单的笑话延伸开来。一点儿也不奇怪，因为当明日香和明日香在一起时，真嗣可以以从前无法做到的方式同时与她们两人相处。

For instance, one evening when Asuka was doing Asuka's hair, she allowed Shinji to stroke her hair at the same time. She asked him to do it actually. She didn't mind him being close to her at all anymore. Asuka touched him more. She talked to him more. She was kind to him as well. Praised him when he did things right, and reproached Asuka when she tried to make fun of him.  
比如，有天晚上明日香在梳自己的头发时，她允许真嗣同时抚摸她的头发。实际上是她要求他这么做的。她不再介意他靠近自己。明日香更多地触碰他。她更多地与他交谈。她对他也很友善。当他做对事情时表扬他，当她试图取笑他时责备自己。

And that's where it started. That's where he really fell in love with her. Because she was nice to him. And she defended him from herself. And that meant the world to him because there was no one else to do it. They were so very much alone.  
而这一切就是从那时开始的。那就是他真正爱上她的时刻。因为她对他很好。她保护他免受自己的伤害。这对他来说意味着整个世界，因为没有其他人会这么做。他们是如此孤独。

Until Misato came back. And with Misato came reality. The realization of what the girl he'd lived with so long had become. In his heart he knew that there was something wrong with the Asuka he'd grown to love, but he was too deluded to do anything about it. He tried to explain to Misato that it wasn't as big of an issue as it seemed. But even he couldn't argue with reason after Misato took the doll away that one night.  
直到美里回来。随着美里的归来，现实也接踵而至。他意识到，与他同居已久的女孩已经变成了什么样子。在他的内心深处，他知道他所爱的明日香有些不对劲，但他太过自欺欺人，无法采取任何行动。他试图向美里解释，这问题并不像看起来那么严重。但就连他自己也无法在美里那晚拿走玩偶后，再与理智争辩。

The screaming. The yelling. She had even tried to hit Misato before Shinji found the doll and brought it back to the girl. With Asuka back in her hands, the girl became quiet again. Kind, sweet, and docile. She told Misato that what she'd done was an awful thing to do, but she apologized for trying to hit her. Exhausted, the girl slept like a baby that night. Shinji cried himself to sleep. Misato rubbed his back.  
尖叫声。怒吼声。她甚至试图在真嗣找到玩偶并带回给她之前打美里。当明日香重新拿回玩偶时，女孩又变得安静了。善良、甜美、温顺。她告诉美里，她所做的是件可怕的事，但也为试图打她而道歉。疲惫不堪的女孩那晚睡得像个婴儿。真嗣哭着入睡。美里轻抚他的背。

But there's no use going into all that. No point in talking about when other people came back or the day that Asuka was officially committed to the mental hospital.  
但深入这一切并无意义。谈论其他人何时回来或明日香正式被送入精神病院的那天，也没有什么意义。

It started back then, his dependence on the girl, but it was still happening now. And if she died, would he die too?  
一切始于那时，他对那女孩的依赖，但如今依旧如此。若她逝去，他也会随之消亡吗？

No. No. No. 不，不，不。

He wouldn't die. Because there were still people left for him. He could never do to others what Asuka had done to him. Not anymore. He'd caused them all enough pain already. He didn't have the heart to cause them more.  
他不会死。因为还有人在等他。他绝不会像明日香对他所做的那样去伤害他人。再也不会了。他已带给他们太多痛苦。他没有心再去增添更多。

He'd alienated Toji with his selfishness. Toji had lost just as much and all he wanted was someone to share with. Shinji had denied him that for no good reason. On a whim. He'd lied to Hikari. Hurt her in order to help himself. The sick pleasure he gained from dreaming of a better Asuka with her had been as cruel as snatching candy from a baby. And Misato...  
他因自私疏远了冬二。冬二同样失去了很多，他只希望能有人分担。真嗣毫无理由地拒绝了他，一时兴起。他对光撒了谎，伤害了她以自救。他幻想中的那个更好的明日香，带给他的病态快感，如同从婴儿手中夺走糖果般残忍。还有美里...

Yes he had said horrible things to Misato, but there was still a part of him that believed they were true. Maybe Misato didn't care for Asuka. Maybe her motives for sticking by Shinji weren't entirely selfless. But that didn't change the fact that she was always there. No matter how depressed Shinji was or how much brooding he did, she always tried to be there for him... until he started pushing her away. The undercurrent of anger he harbored toward his guardian slowly lead her to take longer shifts at work and stay out later at night. But what reason did he have to be angry? No mater what her methods or motives, all she'd ever done was try to help.  
是的，他对美里说了可怕的话，但内心仍有一部分相信那是真的。也许美里并不关心明日香。也许她坚持留在真嗣身边并非完全无私。但这改变不了她始终在场的现实。无论真嗣多么沮丧或沉思，她总是尽力陪伴...直到他开始推开她。他对监护人的隐秘愤怒逐渐使她延长工作时间，深夜才归。但他有什么理由生气呢？无论她的方法或动机如何，她所做的只是试图帮助。

Shinji abruptly laughed out loud drawing a look from the bus driver in the rear view mirror. But he didn't care. He just realized that he'd spent the last few years of his life doing nothing but moping around and being a jerk.  
真嗣突然放声大笑，引得后视镜里的公交车司机投来一瞥。但他并不在意。他刚刚意识到，自己过去几年的生活除了闷闷不乐和当个混蛋之外，什么也没做。

_I am an awful awful person and I don't deserve to die yet.  
我是个糟糕透顶的人，还不配去死。_

Shinji pulled the yellow cord that signaled the driver to stop. His feet seemed to move on their own accord as they lead him off the bus. He found himself standing on the sidewalk. Without thinking he felt himself turn and head towards home.  
真嗣拉下黄色的绳子，示意司机停车。他的双脚仿佛自行其是，引领他走下公交车。他发现自己站在人行道上。未经思考，他便转身朝家的方向走去。

It was dark out and windy. Shinji felt the cold on his forearms. Each step felt surreal. Asuka was gone. It didn't matter if she was dead or living because he would never see her again. As stupid as it sounded, a crazy girl was his only reason for living. But even though she was gone, he didn't deserve to die. It was funny. He was a person for whom death was too good. Instead he would live each and every day of his life hoping only to make amends.  
夜色深沉，风声呼啸。真嗣感受到冷风拂过前臂的寒意。每一步都显得那么不真实。明日香已经不在了。无论她是生是死，他都再也见不到她了。听起来或许很愚蠢，但这个疯狂的女孩是他活下去的唯一理由。然而，即使她已离去，他也不配就此死去。这很讽刺。对于他这样的人来说，死亡都显得过于仁慈。相反，他只能日复一日地活着，只希望能有所弥补。

Hikari might never forgive him. But that didn't matter. He would still give her the chance. He would apologize weakly without giving any explanations. If she wanted him to explain himself she'd ask him. He didn't want to _make_ her forgive him. He just wanted her to have the opportunity.  
也许光永远不会原谅他。但这并不重要。他仍会给她这个机会。他会无力地道歉，不作任何解释。如果她想让他解释，她会问的。他并不奢望她原谅，只是希望她能有这个机会。

He would stick by Toji and Kensuke until it became clear that they wanted him gone. That was important. He would pretend to enjoy himself in their company and never let his problems distract him again. He didn't care if they knew he was faking. It only mattered that they saw him trying. They wouldn't want any sort of formal apology. They would either take note of his change in attitude or they wouldn't. But what to do about Misato?  
他会一直陪伴在真治和健介身边，直到他们明确表示希望他离开。这很重要。他会假装在他们的陪伴中享受乐趣，再也不让自己的问题分散注意力。他不在乎他们是否知道他在假装。重要的是他们看到他在努力。他们不需要任何正式的道歉。他们要么注意到他态度的改变，要么不会。但该如何面对美里呢？

Walking on feet that didn't seem to move, he saw himself reach the door of their apartment. It felt like it had taken no time at all to arrive there. He found that mildly surprising. Staring at the door, he thought about his previous question. What about Misato? She may not be the worlds most perfect guardian, but she didn't deserve to be talked to that way. But what to do about it?  
双脚仿佛未曾移动，他却发现自己已走到公寓门前。感觉似乎一瞬间就到了这里，这让他略感惊讶。盯着门，他想起了之前的问题。关于美里，她或许不是世界上最完美的监护人，但不至于被那样对待。但该怎么做呢？

How do you make up with someone who's help you've needlessly shunned and who's motives you've heavily doubted? Do you bow your head and ask for forgiveness? Sure. Why not? He needed to open the door and tell her he was home and hope for the best. It was strange how hours before he was only concerned with how much he'd been wronged, and now all he wanted was to be forgiven.  
如何与一个你无端疏远、对其动机深感怀疑的人和解？低头请求原谅吗？当然，为什么不呢？他需要打开门，告诉她自己回来了，并期待最好的结果。奇怪的是，几小时前他只关心自己受了多大委屈，而现在他只渴望被原谅。

One deep breath and open the door.  
深吸一口气，然后打开门。

"I'm home," said Shinji. Several seconds passed. Silence answered back. Oh well...  
"我回来了," 真嗣说道。几秒钟过去了。沉默回应了他。唉，算了...

Maybe he should give her a call. Truth be told, he didn't want to bother her at work, but he felt like a new person now. This quest for self-improvement couldn't wait. If he hesitated he would lose his will. So Shinji took a seat on the couch and pulled out his cell phone. After scrolling through his remarkably short contacts list he found her number and pushed the button labeled "send".  
也许他该给她打个电话。说实话，他不想在工作时打扰她，但他现在感觉自己焕然一新。这种自我提升的追求不能等待。如果他犹豫，就会失去决心。于是真嗣在沙发上坐下，拿出手机。在浏览了他异常简短的联系人列表后，他找到了她的号码并按下了标有“发送”的按钮。

"Hello?" said Misato. Shinji was taken slightly off guard. Her tone was harder than he expected. He hadn't planned on talking to 'Work Misato'.  
"喂？" 美里说道。真嗣有些措手不及。她的语气比他预想的要强硬。他没打算和“工作中的美里”交谈。

"Misato?" he asked timidly, as if there could be any doubt as to who he was speaking with.  
"美里吗？" 他怯生生地问道，仿佛还有谁会是他此刻对话的对象似的。

"What Shinji?" she asked, just as hard as before. Shinji realized that this wasn't merely a business voice. Misato was clearly mad. She'd never sounded so... distant. At least not with him. It scared him. He wanted to hang up the phone then and there, but something stopped him from doing so. He had to remind himself that he was doing this for her, not himself.  
"什么事，真嗣？" 她的语气一如既往地严厉。真嗣意识到，这不仅仅是一个公事公办的口吻。美里显然很生气。她从未如此……疏远过。至少对他从未如此。这让他感到害怕。他当时就想挂断电话，但某种力量阻止了他这么做。他不得不提醒自己，他这么做是为了她，而不是为了自己。

"... I'm sorry." "……对不起。"

There was a long pause before Misato said, "Okay."  
沉默良久后，美里才说：“好吧。”

"I said some things I shouldn't have and I didn't mean them... well..."  
“我说了些不该说的话，那些并非我的本意……嗯……”

"I know Shinji. I know." Suddenly Misato's voice became a lot softer. She sounded quite was another brief pause. "Are you alright Shinji?"  
“我了解，真嗣，我了解。”突然间，美里的声音变得柔和了许多。她停顿了一下，接着问：“你还好吗，真嗣？”

"Yeah, I guess..." “嗯，我想是吧...”

"Really?" “真的吗？”

Shinji shook his head, though there was no one there to see it. "I will be," he said. He honestly meant it too. "Are you coming home tonight?"  
尽管四周无人，真嗣还是摇了摇头。“我会回来的，”他说。他的确是真心的。“你今晚回家吗？”

"...I... there's a lot of work to do here... some things I need to finish up..."  
“...我...这里还有很多工作要做...有些事情需要处理完...”

"I understand," said Shinji. He hadn't meant to sound so disappointed.  
"我明白，" 真嗣说道。他并非有意显得如此失望。

"But... I'll try to get out early. Actually... you know what Shinji... I'll be there as soon as I can. Just give me an hour okay? It shouldn't even take that long."  
"但是...我会尽量早点出来。其实...你知道吗，真嗣...我会尽快赶到。给我一个小时好吗？应该用不了那么久的。"

"Alright." "好吧。"

"And don't go off by yourself, alright?"  
"还有，别自己一个人走开，好吗？"

"I won't," said Shinji. "我不会的。" 真嗣说道。

"I mean it," Misato insisted. "Wait up for me."  
"我是认真的，" 美里坚持道，"等我一下。"

"I will." "我会的。"

"And Shinji..." "还有真嗣……"

"Yes?" “是？”

"I love you." “我爱你。”

Shinji's mind momentarily tripped over those words. Misato hung up before he even had a chance to register them. When his brain caught up to his ears he was left with a strangely warm feeling in his chest. Misato had lied to him many times in the past. On this one point, he definitely believed her.  
碇真嗣的思绪在这一刻短暂地停滞了。美里在他还没来得及反应之前就挂断了电话。当他的大脑终于跟上了耳朵的步伐，他心中留下了一种奇异的温暖感。美里过去曾多次对他撒谎。但在这一点上，他绝对相信她。

Slowly but surely the hot feeling in his chest dissipated. A cold numbness settled in. Things were finally beginning to make sense. Misato would come home quickly and when she did he would finally let her take care of him. She would talk to him and ask him how he was feeling and he'd tell her honestly whenever he could. He would focus particularly on the anger and abandonment he felt toward Asuka, because that's what he knew Misato would be most interested in hearing. He would lie to help things along, if the need arose. She would be sympathetic. She'd try to keep the focus squarely on him. They would sit on the couch and she'd wrap a comforting arm around him, just like she used to. Perhaps this would turn into a full embrace. It had happened before. Such things were embarrassing and comforting at the same time. Shinji couldn't claim to love or hate that level of contact with her. Most likely things wouldn't go beyond that. She had kissed him only once since the impact and that had been short and chase. An impulse riding on the wings of a whim. It meant little. A few times they had slept together there on the couch in an awkward heap. He figured that this would be one of those nights. And in the morning they could live again.  
胸中的灼热感渐渐消散，取而代之的是一股冰冷的麻木。一切终于开始变得清晰起来。美里很快就会回家，而当他回来时，他终于会让美里照顾他。她会和他交谈，询问他的感受，而他会在能够的时候诚实地告诉她。他会特别关注对明日香感到的愤怒和被抛弃的情绪，因为他知道这是美里最想听到的。如果有必要，他会撒谎来推动事情的发展。她会表示同情。她会努力将焦点完全放在他身上。他们会坐在沙发上，她会像以前那样用安慰的手臂环绕着他。也许这会演变成一个完整的拥抱。以前也发生过。这样的事情既令人尴尬又令人安慰。真嗣不能说自己喜欢或讨厌与她那样的接触。很可能事情不会超出这个范围。自从那次冲击以来，她只吻过他一次，那次短暂而匆忙。一个随兴而起的冲动。这意义不大。有几次，他们就在沙发上尴尬地挤在一起睡着了。 他猜今晚会是那种夜晚之一。到了早晨，他们又能重新生活。

All he had to do was hold out for an hour or so, then everything would be fine.  
他只需坚持一小时左右，一切就会好起来。

Easier said than done. The apartment was quiet and the thoughts he didn't want to have were eating him alive. _Asuka is a crazy bitch. She's probably dead and..._ Misato loved him, but she didn't say how _like a son? Like a brother? like a lover?_ and Hikari could hate him for the rest of his life but it wouldn't make her feel any better. Happiness is hard to find. Maybe it too, like Asuka, doesn't want to be found. But the pressure... the pent up death was screaming in the back of his mind, knocking on his door like the friends he never had, "could Shinji please come out to play?" No. _I don't want to ride your broken roller coaster. One big hill that goes down and never comes up again._ but all he needed to do was wait an hour and... if he loved Asuka so much then why did he hate her right now?  
说来容易做来难。公寓里静悄悄的，那些他不愿去想的念头正将他吞噬。明日香是个疯婊子。她可能已经死了，还有……美里爱着他，但她没说像儿子？像兄弟？像恋人？而光可能会恨他一辈子，但这并不会让她感觉好些。幸福难以寻觅。也许它也像明日香一样，不想被找到。但那压力……那压抑的死亡在他脑海深处尖叫，像他从未有过的朋友一样敲打着他的门，“真嗣能出来玩吗？”不。我不想坐你那破过山车。一个大坡下去就再也没上来。但他只需等上一个小时，而且……如果他那么爱明日香，那为什么他现在这么恨她？

The cello. 那把大提琴。

The cello could save him. When he played the cello he was lost to the world. Lost to himself. He could be gone without being hurt. A vacation. All he needed was a bow and that finely crafted piece of wood and strings. That were in his room... _god no_... in his room... where the nothingness lives.  
大提琴能救他。当他拉起大提琴时，他会忘却世界，忘却自我。他可以消失而不受伤害，就像一次度假。他所需要的只是一把弓和那精雕细琢的木头与琴弦。它们就在他的房间里……天哪，不……在他的房间里……那里是无尽的虚空。

But it was okay. He promised Misato he would wait for her and that's what he would do. New Shinji keeps his promises. He lives for others, not himself. Shinji would open the door to his room, grab his cello, and head back to the living room. Then he would play for an hour, Misato would show up, and everything would be okay.  
但没关系。他向美里承诺过会等她，这就是他要做的。新的真嗣信守承诺。他为了他人而活，不是为了自己。真嗣会打开房门，拿起他的大提琴，回到客厅。然后他会拉上一个小时，美里会出现，一切都会好起来的。

_So why can't I open the door?  
那我为什么打不开这扇门呢？_

If he never opened the door, he would never see the nothingness. But if he didn't open the door he would never have his cello and the death trapped in the back of his mind would devour him whole. _It's worth it right?_ No. No it's not. It's a funny question to ask. Is death better than nothing? _If it's so funny though, then why am I crying? Kids do things like this. They stand at doors and cry because they don't want to go in them._ But New Shinji wasn't a kid. No. He would open the door and face the nothing and grab the cello to fill the void. Easy. It is a simple thing to enter a room and grab a cello.  
如果他从未打开过那扇门，他就永远不会看到那片虚无。但如果他不打开门，他将永远得不到他的大提琴，而潜藏在他脑海深处的死亡阴影将把他彻底吞噬。这样做值得吗？不，不值得。这是一个多么可笑的问题啊。死亡比虚无更好吗？既然如此可笑，那我为何在哭泣？孩子们会做这样的事。他们站在门前哭泣，因为他们不想进去。但新真嗣不是个孩子。不，他会打开门，直面那片虚无，抓住大提琴来填补空虚。简单。走进一个房间拿起大提琴，这本是一件再简单不过的事。

_Then what's taking so long?  
那为什么还这么久？_

It is a simple thing.  
这是件简单的事。

_Then why don't you do it?  
那你为什么不去做呢？_

Shinji wiped away the tears from his eyes, taking several long moments to bring his breathing under control. He was calm and collected. He had promised Misato. He would not go into his room and lock the door. _Hand on the handle. Turn and push._  
真嗣擦去眼中的泪水，花了好一会儿才控制住呼吸。他平静而镇定。他向美里保证过。他不会走进房间锁上门。手放在门把手上。转动并推开。

_Open._

Shinji's clothes were everywhere. The covers and sheets from his bed were lying in a pile on the floor. The mattress was overturned. His trash can had been emptied. All the drawers of his dresser were removed. His cello smashed open. Broken on the ground. The neck severed from the body. Wooden splinters littered the carpet. _Amazing._ He couldn't have done a better job himself. His room had become a hailstorm of chaos. There was Asuka with a cross around her neck, kneeling at it's center.  
真嗣的衣服散落一地。床上的被单和床单堆在地板上。床垫被翻了个底朝天。垃圾桶被清空了。衣柜的所有抽屉都被拉了出来。他的大提琴被砸开，破碎地躺在地上，琴颈与琴身分离。木屑散落在地毯上。太惊人了。他自己也做不到比这更好的破坏了。他的房间变成了一场混乱的冰雹风暴。而阿斯卡就在这风暴的中心，脖子上挂着十字架，跪在那里。

"Oh, Hi Shinji," Asuka said casually while staring at Shinji's shoes. Her face was streaked with tears. Her hair was unkempt and disheveled. Her clothes were dirty and wrinkled. She wore the same thing she had worn the last time he'd visited her - black slacks and a white blouse - yet somehow they seemed dingy and old.  
“哦，嗨，真嗣，”阿斯卡随意地说道，目光盯着真嗣的鞋子。她的脸颊上泪痕斑斑。头发凌乱不堪。衣服又脏又皱。她穿着上次他见她时的那套衣服——黑色长裤和白色衬衫——但不知怎么的，它们看起来又脏又旧。

Shinji couldn't help it. He completely froze.  
真嗣情不自禁。他完全僵住了。

"Sorry about the mess," said Asuka as if talking about the weather. "I was looking for... something."  
"抱歉这里乱糟糟的，" 明日香仿佛在谈论天气一般说道，"我刚才在找……某样东西。"

Shinji took a big breath. All he could say was, "Asuka."  
真嗣深吸了一口气。他只能说："明日香。"

"Yes," said Asuka. "She's much harder to find than I anticipated. And I looked very thoroughly too." Asuka let out a small tired laugh. "At first I was sure that the doctors had her. They were so certain that they could help me find what I was looking for. How could I be blamed for believing them? My friend, Takashi, you never met him, he showed me how to walk through their walls. And I told you a long time ago, that I already knew were to look. But when I looked through Dr. Komatsu's office, imagine my surprise Shinji. She wasn't there."  
"是的，" 明日香说，"她比我想象中难找多了。而且我也找得非常仔细。" 明日香发出了一声疲惫的轻笑，"起初我确信医生们把她藏起来了。他们那么肯定能帮我找到我要的东西。我怎么会怪自己相信了他们呢？我的朋友，高志，你没见过他，他教我如何穿墙而过。很久以前我就告诉过你，我知道该去哪里找。但当我透过小松医生的办公室看时，真嗣，你能想象我的惊讶吗？她不在那里。"

Shinji just stared on in disbelief.  
真嗣只是难以置信地盯着。

"That's when I realized that the doctors didn't have her. No one did. You know Asuka, Shinji. She'd never let anyone own her like that. Even if she is a doll. So I thought to myself, 'where would she go?'" This question was posed almost as if she expected Shinji to answer it. "So of course I stopped by the Horaki's. But there wasn't anyone there. The whole house was empty. Not a piece of furniture in the place. Did you know that Hikari moved Shinji? She never even told me. I suppose I should be offended, but I can't say I blame her. We always were such a bother to her."  
"就在那时，我意识到医生们并没有找到她。没有人找到。你知道的，真嗣，明日香。她绝不会让别人那样拥有她。即使她是个玩偶。于是我自问，'她会去哪儿呢？'"这个问题几乎像是她期待真嗣能回答。"所以我当然去了洞木家。但那里一个人也没有。整个房子空空如也。屋里一件家具都没有。你知道洞木光搬走了吗，真嗣？她甚至没告诉我。我想我应该感到被冒犯，但我不能说我不理解她。我们总是给她添麻烦。"

"I'm sorry," said Shinji though he wasn't exactly sure why. Maybe if he'd passed on Hikari's frequent words of kindness he could have saved her a trip, but that didn't make his apology any less ridiculous. Hadn't he been mad at her no more than 5 minutes ago?  
"对不起，"真嗣说道，尽管他不太确定为什么要道歉。也许如果他转达了洞木光常说的那些善意的话，就能省去她一趟，但这并不使他的道歉显得不那么荒谬。难道他不是在五分钟前还对她生气吗？

"Don't be." People were always saying that to him. "It's not your fault really. I'm sure you would have told me if you'd known."  
"别这样。" 人们总是这样对他说。"这真的不是你的错。我相信如果你知道的话，一定会告诉我的。"

Shinji's face soured. 真嗣的脸色变得难看起来。

"So I walked around the city for a while. I went to all of Asuka's favorite stores and hang outs. I saw a classmate of ours at one of them. I don't think we were very good friends because she didn't seem particularly glad to see me. But I didn't see Asuka anywhere. She wasn't out and about as I figured she would be."  
"于是我在城里逛了一会儿。我去了所有明日香喜欢的商店和常去的地方。在其中一家店里，我遇到了我们班的一个同学。我觉得我们并不是很好的朋友，因为她见到我似乎并不特别高兴。但我没在任何地方看到明日香。她没有像我预想的那样在外面闲逛。"

Asuka finally looked at Shinji. Her eyes were red tired. Her mouth was twisted downward into the slightest of frowns.  
绫波终于看向了真嗣。她的眼睛因疲惫而泛红，嘴角微微向下扭曲，显露出些许忧愁。

"For a while I gave up hope. I must have looked silly wandering aimlessly around the city. But then I remembered this place, Shinji. I thought... I just knew she'd be here. Because of you. She always seemed to like you so much, so I just knew she had to be here with you. And I thought that maybe that was for the best. Maybe you could take care of her like you once said you would. It sounded perfect actually. I really did hope I'd find her here with you."  
有一段时间，我放弃了希望。我一定看起来很可笑，漫无目的地在城市里徘徊。但后来我想起了这个地方，真嗣。我想...我就是知道她会在这里。因为你。她似乎总是很喜欢你，所以我就是知道她一定和你在一起。而且我想，也许这样最好。也许你能像你曾经承诺的那样照顾她。听起来真的很完美。我真的希望能在你这里找到她。

Asuka's frown deepened. 绫波的眉头皱得更深了。

"I looked everywhere, Shinji. I even looked in the places where I knew she couldn't be." Shinji's eyes glanced back at his broken cello. "But she's not here. And I thought 'if she really cared about him so much, she would be here wouldn't she'. But she's isn't here. And I don't think she's ever coming back."  
"我到处都找过了，真嗣。我甚至去了那些我知道她不可能在的地方。" 真嗣的目光再次落在他那把破碎的大提琴上。"但她不在这里。我想，'如果她真的那么在乎他，她应该在这里，不是吗'。但她不在这里。而且我觉得她再也不会回来了。"

Tears began to well in Asuka's eyes.  
泪水开始在明日香的眼中涌出。

"The truth is... she doesn't care about you at all Shinji. She doesn't want to be owned by you anymore than she wants to be owned by the doctors. She's a selfish little girl who only looks out for herself. But the irony is that she doesn't even like herself! She's rude, she's mean, and she's unkind. And she would throw any one of us under a bus to get what she wants. But she doesn't even know what she wants! And the things that she thinks she wants... she's too afraid to get them."  
"事实是...她根本不在乎你，真嗣。她不想被你拥有，也不想被医生拥有。她是个自私的小女孩，只关心自己。但讽刺的是，她甚至不喜欢自己！她粗鲁、刻薄、不善良。为了得到她想要的，她会把我们任何一个人推到车轮下。但她甚至不知道自己想要什么！而那些她以为自己想要的东西...她又太害怕去争取。"

Asuka's face contorted in fury as she spoke.  
明日香的脸因愤怒而扭曲，她开口说道。

"She's a weak, cowardly, disgusting bitch! I hate her!" Asuka yelled. But her next words came out in a breathless whisper.  
“她是个软弱、胆小、令人作呕的婊子！我恨她！”明日香大喊道。但接下来的话语却变成了气喘吁吁的低语。

"Why do I have to be her?" she asked. Her hands rose to her face and she began to openly weep.  
“为什么我非得是她不可？”她问道。双手举到脸上，开始放声哭泣。

Her great gasping sobs moved Shinji into action. He knelt down in front of her, put both arms around her and said, "I love you."  
她那剧烈的抽泣声触动了真嗣，他跪在她面前，双臂环抱住她，说道：“我爱你。”

Asuka tried her hardest to blink away her tears. Between rasping sobs she managed to ask, "Why?"  
明日香竭尽全力试图眨去泪水，在断断续续的抽泣中，她勉强问道：“为什么？”

"I don't know," said Shinji.  
“我不知道，”真嗣回答。

Asuka cried harder. 明日香哭得更厉害了。

Later that evening Misato came home and found the two of them kneeling in their quiet embrace. She stared at them for one full minute before closing the door to Shinji's room. She spent the night sleeping with her back pressed against the door.  
那天傍晚，美里回到家，发现他们俩正静静地相拥跪着。她盯着他们看了整整一分钟，然后关上了真嗣房间的门。那一夜，她背靠着门睡了一宿。

In the morning all three of them drove Asuka back to the hospital. They parted with a series of brief and somber goodbyes. Shinji promised to visit her as soon as he could. For this, Asuka was grateful.  
清晨，他们三人一起开车送明日香回医院。临别时，他们简短而沉重地互道珍重。真嗣承诺一有机会就会去看她，这让明日香感到欣慰。

The doctors were initially at a loss concerning the girl. Not all of the progress she made during her stay had been superficial, but they were forced to re-evaluate the motives behind everything she had ever said. The privileges she'd gained within the hospital were once again restricted and for a time she was monitored closely. Much time passed before Dr. Komatsu felt she could be trusted again. Two weeks passed before she was allowed to have visitors. Shinji did his best to visit her every day he could. Even Misato made an appearance there periodically. five and a half months passed before she was finally released.  
医生们最初对这名女孩的情况感到困惑。她在住院期间取得的进步并非全部浮于表面，但他们不得不重新评估她所说的一切背后的动机。她在医院内获得的特权再次受到限制，一段时间内她被严密监控。过了很久，小松医生才觉得可以再次信任她。两周后，她才被允许接待访客。真嗣尽其所能，尽可能每天去探望她。甚至美里也偶尔出现在那里。五个半月后，她终于获释。

She never found Asuka. At least not the Asuka she used to be. For that she was glad. What she did find was something much harder to define. Though the doctors did their best, she never became magically whole. She didn't even know what being whole meant. She was just a fragile girl searching for comfort and direction. She would spend her whole life coming to terms with that.  
她从未找到过明日香，至少不是她曾经认识的那个明日香。对此她感到庆幸。她所发现的东西更难以定义。尽管医生们尽了最大努力，她并未奇迹般地变得完整。她甚至不知道完整的意义是什么。她只是一个脆弱的女孩，寻求安慰和方向。她将用一生来接受这一点。

Asuka's adjustment to regular life was slow and incomplete. Living with Misato again presented it's challenges. Harsh words aren't easily taken back. Especially when they contain a measure of truth. But all parties managed to stay civil. They were able to keep peace by maintaining emotional distance.  
明日香适应正常生活的过程缓慢而不彻底。再次与美里同住带来了不少挑战。伤人的话语不易收回，尤其是当它们包含几分真相时。但各方都设法保持了礼貌。他们通过保持情感距离来维持和平。

Hikari was genuinely glad to have Asuka back, though like all friendships affected by the impact, things just weren't the same. The opposing forces of discomfort and familiarity reached equilibrium for the two of them. They began to hang out regularly and Hikari reacquired her role as Asuka's one and only female friend. Somewhere along the line, she found it in her heart to forgive Shinji for misleading her, though they were never close again. that was probably for the best. It would have made Asuka jealous anyways.  
光真心为明日香的归来感到高兴，尽管所有受冲击影响的友谊都已不同往昔。不适与熟悉的力量在她们之间达到了平衡。她们开始定期相聚，光重新扮演起明日香唯一女性朋友的角色。不知何时，她心中原谅了真嗣误导她的事，尽管他们再未亲近。这或许是最好的结果。毕竟，这无论如何都会让明日香嫉妒。

Shinji tried to be a good person when he could. His past life had been convenient. He had placed his hopes in Asuka, put the blame on Misato, and taken comfort in Hikari. But he could no longer live that way. His conscious wouldn't let him. Instead he tried to care of his friends. He did nice things for Misato when he could. He realized that whatever he felt for Asuka, it didn't have to eclipse everything in his life. Putting all his hopes and dreams onto one person wasn't fair. It wasn't healthy, kind, or safe. And in the end, he never did figure out whether he would have been better off without her in his life. But he did realize one thing. Whether it be right or wrong, whether he loved it or hated it, he would always live or die by Asuka's smile.  
真嗣尽可能地努力成为一个好人。他过去的生活很便利。他把希望寄托在明日香身上，把责任推给美里，从光那里寻求安慰。但他不能再这样生活下去了。他的良心不允许。相反，他试图关心他的朋友们。他尽可能地为美里做些好事。他意识到，无论他对明日香的感情如何，这并不需要掩盖他生活中的其他一切。将所有的希望和梦想寄托在一个人身上是不公平的。这既不健康，也不善良，更不安全。最终，他从未弄清楚如果没有她在他的生活中，他是否会过得更好。但他确实明白了一件事。无论是对是错，无论是爱是恨，他的生死都将取决于明日香的微笑。

**AN:** It's been a long time coming. This story has finally come to a close. I'd like to thank my The Mustachioed Cat for beta reading this last chapter. It flows that much better because of him. I'd also like to thank Eric Blair who previously pre-read for me as his input lead toward the writing of some of the scenes I liked the most. Go read their stuff. Also I'd like to thank everyone who reviewed and/or read this. Especially Azure Lily whose review inspired me to continue beyond the first chapter.  
作者注：这一刻终于来临。这个故事终于画上了句号。我要感谢我的猫咪 The Mustachioed Cat，他为这最后一章chapter进行了校对，正因为有他，故事才更加流畅。同时，也要感谢 Eric Blair，他曾为我预读，他的建议促成了我最喜欢的几场戏的创作。去读读他们的作品吧。此外，我还要感谢所有评论和/或阅读过这篇故事的人，尤其是 Azure Lily，她的评论激励我超越最初的chapter继续前行。

All in all I still don't know if I should have continued this or not, but I'm more or less satisfied with the way things went. I'm sure some of you will be unsatisfied with the ending, especially after the high note that chapter 4 ended on. Can't please everyone. Feel free to let me know how you feel about it. I always look forward to constructive criticism. And hey, I never turn down words of praise either.  
总的来说，我仍然不确定是否应该继续这个故事，但我对事情的发展感到或多或少的满意。我确信你们中的一些人会对结局感到不满，尤其是在chapter第四章的高潮之后。无法取悦所有人。欢迎随时告诉我你的感受，我总是期待建设性的批评。而且，嘿，我也从不拒绝赞美之词。

And thus ends my Oscar acceptance speech. As always, thanks for reading.  
就这样，我的奥斯卡获奖感言结束了。一如既往，感谢阅读。
