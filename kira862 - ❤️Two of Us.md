Third Impact had been avoided, for better or for worse. The world had been saved, and everything was set as it should be. But was that really true? For two people, that may not necessarily be true.  
第三次冲击被避免了，无论结果是好是坏。世界得救了，一切回归正轨。但这真的就是真相吗？对两个人来说，这未必是事实。

Shinji and Asuka had connected with each other, they had loved each other, they had fought for each other, and then at the end of it all, they had lost each other. Had everything been futile then? Had every moment they had ever spent with each other been for naught? Maybe this was true, but the body remembered.  
真嗣和明日香曾彼此相连，他们相爱，为对方而战，最终却失去了彼此。那么，这一切都是徒劳的吗？他们共度的每一刻都毫无意义吗？或许确实如此，但身体却记得。

Love is a strange thing, and love can vary from person to person. The love of a husband and wife; the love of a father and mother; the love of a boyfriend and girlfriend. Love can vary depending on the individuals definition of what "love" is. Love is more an emotion, more like a feeling you have when you are around somebody, something which can't be replicated no matter how many times you attempt to recreate it.  
爱是一种奇妙的东西，因人而异。夫妻之爱；父母之爱；男女朋友之爱。爱的定义因人而异。爱更多是一种情感，一种当你在别人身边时的感觉，无论尝试多少次都无法复制。

So then what hope did Shinji and Asuka ever have to love each other again? Maybe it was simply the fact that they were drawn to each other, that such an outcome was always unthinkable. But that love had to be rekindled, reborn to what it once was.  
那么，真嗣和明日香还有什么希望再次相爱呢？也许仅仅是因为他们被彼此吸引，这样的结果总是难以想象。但那份爱必须重新点燃，重生为曾经的模样。

Love is an abstract thing, similar to that of AT-fields and memories. It can't be seen, except in the vision of the person who is seeing it. Some describe it as red, while others simply describe it as a warm feeling in the heart. People try to explain what they feel, but are unable to. Why is that? Is it because they don't understand each other? That they don't understand what love is?"  
爱是一种抽象的东西，类似于 AT 力场和记忆。它看不见，除非在看到它的人的视野中。有人形容它是红色的，而其他人则简单地描述为心中的温暖感觉。人们试图解释他们的感受，但却无法做到。为什么呢？是因为他们彼此不理解吗？还是因为他们不明白什么是爱？

Then what about Shinji and Asuka? Neither of them understood what love was when they first met, having never experienced such a thing in either of there lives before meeting each other. So then, how was it that two fifteen year olds were able to understand the concept better then adults? Is it because they were younger, that they didn't understand things?  
那么，真嗣和明日香呢？他们初次相遇时都不明白什么是爱，因为在此之前他们都没有经历过这样的事情。那么，两个十五岁的孩子是如何比成年人更好地理解这个概念的呢？是因为他们年轻，所以不懂事吗？

Or was it because that they had first connected as human beings, before making that next giant leap?  
还是因为他们首先作为人类建立了联系，然后才迈出了那巨大的一步？

Whatever the reason was, Shinji and Asuka had once loved each other, that much was certain. But now, as the earth settled back into its normal rotation, and the Tree of Life began regrowing, they would have to make do with what was given to them. Third Impact was over with, and the Lilim would return one day and reside once again upon the earth. But until then, Shinji and Asuka were given time to grow whole once again.  
无论原因是什么，碇真嗣和明日香曾经相爱过，这一点是毋庸置疑的。但现在，随着地球恢复正常的自转，生命之树开始重新生长，他们只能接受所给予的一切。第三次冲击已经结束，人类将有一天会重返地球。但在那之前，真嗣和明日香被赋予了时间，让他们再次变得完整。

Shinji opened his eyes groggily; he had passed into a restless sleep, nothing of which he seemed to have recalled. He had dreamt something, but he didn't know what.  
真嗣昏昏沉沉地睁开眼睛；他陷入了一个不安的睡眠，似乎什么都没记住。他做了个梦，但不知道是什么。

He instead turned his gaze to the girl lying on the beach next to him. She was still motionless. Shinji had checked every hour or so, but she still continued breathing normally. Once or twice, he had almost nudged her gently, but stopped himself at the last minute. Part of him wanted to continue watching her sleep, but the other part of him wanted to talk to her, to get to know her, to understand who she was.  
他转而将目光投向躺在沙滩上的女孩。她依然一动不动。真嗣每隔一小时左右就会检查一次，但她仍然正常呼吸。有一两次，他几乎轻轻地碰了她一下，但最后一刻停住了。一部分他想继续看着她睡觉，但另一部分他想和她说话，了解她，理解她是谁。

Shinji was admittedly lonely, and he was rather surprised at that. He had never cared much about people before, but this girl who he had never once seen in his life...  
真嗣确实感到孤独，对此他颇为惊讶。他以前从未真正在意过别人，但这个女孩，他一生中从未见过一面...

'What is wrong with me?' thought Shinji.  
'我这是怎么了？' 真嗣心想。

Looking once more at her pale skin and her sleeping face, Shinji turned away from her, and passed into another fitful sleep, in which his thoughts were filled with that girls face.  
再次看向她苍白的皮肤和沉睡的面容，真嗣转过身去，陷入了另一场不安的睡眠，梦中满是那个女孩的面容。

### Chapter 2: New Beginnings  
第二章：新的开始  

**ANNNNNNNND I'M BACK. Wow Jesus how long has it been...four months I think? Anyway yeah sorry guys about that long bout of nothing. I just had so much stuff going on during that last term of school that this was put on the back burner for a long time. But I'm back to updating this (for a while at least, things might get slow again in September). So again, thanks to everybody that waited patiently for this and I apologize for the wait.  
我回来了。哇，天哪，这都过去多久了……四个月吧？总之，很抱歉让大家等了这么久。上个学期我实在太忙了，以至于这件事一直被搁置。但现在我又回来更新了（至少暂时是这样，九月可能又会慢下来）。再次感谢所有耐心等待的朋友，对于等待我深表歉意。**

---

Shinji opened his eyes slowly.  
真嗣缓缓睁开了眼睛。

For several seconds, as he looked around, he didn't know where he was.  
有几秒钟，他环顾四周，不知道自己在哪里。

Then he looked down at the girl next to him with strawberry colored hair and he remembered. Or at least, he remembered some things...  
然后他低头看着身边那个草莓色头发的女孩，他想起来了。或者说，至少他想起了一些事情……

The sun was setting over on the horizon, turning the blood colored water a sickly red hue. The capsized battleships floating meaninglessly out in the Bay of Tokyo-3, their purposes long served. Above the beaches where Shinji sat on, the city of Tokyo-3 lay quietly, almost as though it was sleeping peacefully. Such a calm sound had not been heard in this part of the world for a long forgotten time.  
太阳正缓缓沉入地平线，将血色的水面染成病态的红色。倾覆的战舰无意义地漂浮在东京-3 湾，它们早已完成了使命。在真嗣坐着的沙滩上方，东京-3 市静静地躺着，仿佛在安详地沉睡。这片世界的一隅，已经很久没有听到过如此平静的声音了。

Amidst all of this, Shinji and the girl next to him where the only two people that stood out among the destruction of Tokyo-3 and the world.  
在这片混乱之中，唯有真嗣和他身旁的女孩在东京-3 及世界的废墟中显得格外突出。

Shinji continued gazing at the sun, watching it slowly continue setting, seemingly sinking into the ocean. Now that he was awake, he had to admit that he was a little afraid.  
真嗣继续凝视着太阳，看着它缓缓西沉，仿佛沉入了大海。醒来后，他不得不承认自己有些害怕。

During his brief nap, he had hoped that more humans would show up, someone that could help him, or even explain what had happened to everything. But now, with night starting, he was having to face reality that he may be the only person in the city.  
在短暂的打盹期间，他曾希望会有更多的人出现，能有人帮助他，或是解释这一切是如何发生的。但如今夜幕降临，他不得不面对现实，自己可能是这座城市里唯一的幸存者。

'Or at least one of the only people,' he thought as he eyes trailed down towards the girl next to him. Her chest was still slowly moving up and down, indicating that she was breathing, but Shinji had hoped that she would have woken up while he had been asleep. He would at least have someone to talk to and maybe she even knew what had happened. Her attire would certainly suggest that she wasn't a normal fifteen year old girl.  
“或者说至少是其中之一，”他心想，目光顺着身旁女孩的方向滑落。她的胸膛仍在缓缓起伏，表明她还活着，但真嗣本希望她能在他熟睡时醒来。那样至少有人可以交谈，或许她甚至知道发生了什么。她的装束无疑表明她不是普通的十五岁少女。

Shinji looked at her for a few seconds longer, letting his eyes travel over her face before he shook his head and stood up. He didn't know what he was gonna do, but simply sitting wasn't helping. He needed to think.  
真嗣又多看了她几秒钟，目光在她脸上游移，随后摇了摇头站起身来。他不知道自己该做什么，但只是坐着无济于事。他需要思考。

Standing up he directed his gaze farther down the beach and then up the sandy slope behind him to the wreckage that was Tokyo-3. He supposed that he would have to go into the city eventually, but he didn't feel like he was ready for that. Things still hadn't...quite sunk in yet.  
站起身来，他将视线投向更远的沙滩，然后转向身后沙坡上的废墟——东京-3。他想自己迟早得进城，但感觉还没准备好面对这一切。事情仍未完全……沉入心底。

Digging his hands into his pockets, he started walking along the beach, just as the sun disappeared across the water.  
他将双手插进口袋，沿着海滩开始漫步，就在太阳消失在水面之际。

'Okay...what had happened?' was Shinji's first thought.  
'好吧……发生了什么？'这是真嗣的第一个念头。

The end of the world was the most apparent answer, but Shinji couldn't just take that laying down.  
世界末日是最显而易见的答案，但真嗣不能就这样躺平接受。

He been living in Tokyo-3 for what...half a year or so? His father had sent him here at the beginning of the year and made him live at an apartment with some guy. His father had brought him here for an unknown reason, but Shinji had wondered if it hadn't had something to do with Nerv. He could remember waking up this morning and going to class and everything as if it was a normal day...and then nothing. Several hours seemed to have just been taken out of his memory it seemed like. He was supposed to be living with a new roommate tomorrow also, but that didn't seem like it would be happening anytime soon.  
他在第三新东京市住了多久来着...大概半年左右吧？年初时，他的父亲把他送到这里，让他和一个家伙住在公寓里。父亲带他来这里的原因不明，但真嗣怀疑这与 NERV 有关。他记得今早醒来去上课，一切都像平常一样...然后就什么都没有了。几个小时似乎从他的记忆中消失了。他原本明天要和一个新室友一起住，但那似乎不会很快发生。

Kicking his feet as he walked along the sand, he looked towards a large building that seemed to have been a hotel of some sorts. It looked like the building had been in disrepair for several years. Was it somehow possible that Shinji had been sent into the future somehow?  
他一边沿着沙滩走，一边踢着脚下的沙子，目光投向一座看似曾是酒店的大型建筑。那栋楼看起来已经破败多年。难道真嗣不知怎么地被送到了未来？

'Thats fucking stupid,' thought Shinji. 'No...something more plausible than that.'  
'这他妈的太蠢了，'真嗣心想。'不...比那更合理的事情。'

Though he honestly couldn't think of anything.  
虽然他真的想不出任何事情。

Stopping suddenly he looked up towards the sky and was surprised that he could see the stars. He couldn't remember ever seeing the stars his entire time living in Tokyo-3.  
他突然停下脚步，抬头望向天空，惊讶地发现自己能看到星星。他不记得自己在东京-3 生活的整个时间里曾见过星星。

"Are there really no other humans?" mumbled Shinji.  
“真的没有其他人类了吗？”真嗣喃喃自语。

He had never really enjoyed associating with people, but to just have everyone disappear all at once was just too strange.  
他从未真正喜欢与人交往，但所有人突然间全部消失，这未免太过诡异。

"It doesn't make any sense," sighed Shinji.  
“这毫无道理，”真嗣叹息道。

Running a hand through his hair he looked back towards the way he had come. He could still see the body of the girl in the distance, and was glad that he could still see her. Though the darkness was certainly starting to get heavier, and without the light from Tokyo-3-  
他用手梳理着头发，回头望向他来时的路。他仍能看到远处那女孩的遗体，庆幸自己还能看见她。尽管黑暗确实开始变得浓重，若没有第三新东京市的光亮——

'This might be a problem,' thought Shinji.  
“这可能是个问题，”真嗣心想。

He didn't know what had happened, or why it seemed only himself and the strange girl were alive in the city, but right now he had to focus on other things.  
他不知道发生了什么，或者为什么这座城市里似乎只有他和那个陌生女孩还活着，但此刻他必须专注于其他事情。

Walking to the edge of the water, he ran his hand in it, but only felt the odd substance of the fluid, almost like sand. It was like he was on a different world, a separate earth. Nothing made sense.  
走到水边，他伸手进去，却只感觉到那种奇怪的液体，几乎像沙子一样。这感觉就像他身处另一个世界，一个截然不同的地球。一切都说不通。

'I'm alive though, so I suppose I should be thankful for that.'  
'我还活着，所以我想我应该为此感到庆幸。'

Though was he really being honest? With the world as it was, living would be-  
尽管他真的诚实吗？在这个世界上，活着会是——

Shinji stopped himself here; it was pointless to think about anything other than the next hour of his life.  
真嗣在这里打断了自己的思绪；除了接下来的一个小时，思考其他任何事情都是没有意义的。

Turning towards the ruins of Tokyo-3, a frown passed over his face. He knew that he would have to explore them tonight, even if he didn't really want to. And though he didn't want to admit it, the fact that the girl hadn't woken up yet was starting to trouble him.  
转身望向东京-3 的废墟，他眉头紧锁。他知道今晚必须去探查一番，尽管内心并不情愿。而且，尽管他不愿承认，女孩至今未醒的事实开始让他感到困扰。

Moving away from the water, he decided on his course, though whether it was the correct or wrong decision, he didn't know.  
离开水边，他决定了自己的路线，尽管这决定是对是错，他无从知晓。

Walking back to where the girl lay didn't take long and he was soon caught in a problem; he didn't want to let her out of his sight. It was worry more than anything. He didn't want to run the risk of him not being there when she woke up, or if something more serious happened-  
走回女孩躺着的地方并不需要太久，很快他就遇到了一个问题；他不想让她离开自己的视线。更多的是出于担忧。他不想冒着她醒来时或发生更严重情况时自己不在的风险——

Shinji shook his head. 真嗣摇了摇头。

'Best not to think about that,' he thought.  
'最好别去想那件事，'他心想。

On the other hand though, he couldn't very well carry her. It would have been...awkward.  
不过另一方面，他也不太可能把她抱起来。那样会显得...很尴尬。

'What to do,' thought Shinji. 'I don't want to leave her, but at the same time I don't have much of a choice.'  
“该怎么办呢，”真嗣心想，“我不想离开她，但同时我也没有太多选择。”

Shinji then noticed a piece of driftwood not too far off in the distance. Looking around him, he noticed that there was a strange amount of wood laying around the beach, most of which seemed to have been splintered off from buildings.  
随后，真嗣注意到不远处有一块浮木。环顾四周，他发现海滩上散落着大量木头，其中大部分似乎是从建筑物上碎裂下来的。

"Right...a fire would work," mumbled Shinji as he started counting the pieces of wood. The fire would help not only to relieve his worries of the girl, but also if there were any more survivors, they may see the flames and be drawn to it.  
"“对……生火应该有用，”真嗣喃喃自语，开始数起木柴的数量。火不仅能缓解他对女孩的担忧，如果有其他幸存者，他们也可能看到火光而被吸引过来。”

'But making it is another problem,' frowned Shinji. He had never tried lighting a flame without anything other than a match.  
"“但生火又是另一个问题，”真嗣皱眉道。他从未尝试过不用火柴以外的任何东西点燃火焰。”

'One step at a time,' he told himself as he stood up. He was rather glad to be moving and having a set goal to work towards. It certainly kept his mind off of other things.  
“一步一个脚印，”他自言自语道，站起身来。能够行动并有一个明确的目标去努力，他感到相当欣慰。这无疑让他的思绪从其他事情上转移开来。

Gathering up as much dry wood as he could, he then scaled the sandy slope behind him to the top where there was some dry brush and picked several handfuls and brought it back down to the beach. He didn't have any sort of way to chop the wood so he dug a hole in the sand using one of the pieces of wood and dug himself a sand pit. Placing the larger pieces of wood at the bottom, he stacked it higher with the smaller pieces, hoping that it would burn longer like this. He kept a pile of wood next to this pit as extra kindling incase the flames started to die down.  
他尽可能多地收集干木柴，然后爬上身后沙质的斜坡，到达顶部有一些干枯灌木的地方，抓了几大把带回海滩。他没有工具来劈开木头，于是用一根木头在沙地上挖了一个洞，为自己挖了一个沙坑。他将较大的木块放在底部，用较小的木块堆叠得更高，希望这样能让火燃烧得更久。他在沙坑旁留了一堆木柴作为额外的引火物，以防火焰开始减弱。

Now though, the problem was exactly how he was going to make those flames.  
不过现在，问题在于他究竟要如何制造出那些火焰。

Climbing back up the slope he stood up at the top and looked towards the destruction of Tokyo-3. Everything was much more apparent up here.  
他爬回坡顶，站起身来，望向被摧毁的第三新东京市。站在这里，一切景象都更加清晰可见。

The shops and stores that littered the edge of the beach looked as though they had been bombed from the inside. Empty holes filled the window frames and twisting pieces of metal lined the sides of them, indicating that they were once chairs and tables. Most likely a coffee shop of some kind. Thankfully though, a road also ran along this stretch of the beach and Shinji didn't think he would have to search far before he found a lighter.  
散布在海滩边缘的商店和店铺看起来就像是从内部被轰炸过一样。窗框里填满了空洞，扭曲的金属片沿着两侧排列，表明它们曾经是椅子和桌子。很可能是某种咖啡店。不过幸运的是，海滩这一段也有一条路，真嗣认为他不用费多大力气就能找到一个打火机。

Any thought that what he was doing was wrong must have been long since abandoned, because Shinji had no problems going through the cars, purses, glove compartments, and other peoples belongings as he searched for a lighter. Maybe it was because of his disassociation with people in general, or maybe he just buried that part of his mind which told him it was wrong. Certainly if there had been bodies in the cars like he had initially been worried about, or the peoples clothes he would have had second thoughts. But without any of this, he was able to pick through things without thinking about it.  
任何认为他所做的事情是错误的念头肯定早已被抛诸脑后，因为真嗣在寻找打火机时，毫不犹豫地翻遍了汽车、钱包、手套箱和其他人的物品。也许是因为他与人们普遍的疏离感，或者他只是埋葬了那部分告诉他这是错误的思想。当然，如果车里有像他最初担心的尸体，或者人们的衣物，他可能会有所犹豫。但没有这些，他就能毫不犹豫地翻找东西。

Finally after about the seventh car he had been through, he found a lighter on the ground of the drive side door. Flicking it on, a golden flame lit in front of him and seemed to wave back and forth at him. Flicking it off, Shinji leaned out of the car and stood up.  
终于，在检查了大约第七辆车后，他在驾驶座车门的地板上发现了一个打火机。轻轻一按，一簇金色的火焰在他面前燃起，似乎在向他摇摆。关掉打火机，真嗣探出车外，站了起来。

Sliding back down the slope to the beach below, he jogged to the fire pit and kneeled down next to it. Setting the brush on top of the wood, he placed the lighter in the brush and lit it. Grabbing some of the smaller logs, he placed them gently on top of the brush, letting the logs catch fire. Shifting the logs that were now lit around, he proceeded to gently stroke the fire, catching the sparks on the other pieces of wood. Tokyo-3's nights could be particularly brutal at times, and Shinji wanted not only himself, but the girl to be warm.  
他滑下斜坡回到海滩，小跑向篝火坑，跪在旁边。将树枝放在木头上，他把打火机放在树枝中点燃。抓起一些小木柴，轻轻放在树枝上，让木柴着火。移动已经点燃的木柴，他开始温柔地拨弄火焰，让火花点燃其他木块。第三新东京市的夜晚有时特别严酷，真嗣不仅希望自己，也希望那个女孩能感到温暖。

Glancing over at her, he saw that she was still sleeping...or unconscious. He wasn't really sure to be true. But she was still breathing, and that seemed to be okay.  
他瞥了她一眼，发现她还在睡...或者是不省人事。他不太确定真相如何。但她仍在呼吸，这似乎还算好。

With the fire roaring now and warmth starting to spread through his body, Shinji's mind went back to the darkness of Tokyo-3. He wasn't tired, and this surprised him since he had been up and down that slope now twice over, but he wasn't sure if he was ready to look for anything else in that darkness.  
随着火焰熊熊燃烧，温暖开始传遍全身，真嗣的思绪回到了东京-3 的黑暗中。他并不困倦，这让他感到惊讶，因为他已经在这斜坡上上下下了两次，但他不确定自己是否准备好在这黑暗中寻找其他东西。

He was hungry however, and this suddenly became apparent as he felt his stomach rumble.  
他饿了，这一点突然变得明显，因为他感到肚子咕噜作响。

Food was one thing, but water was entirely different. If he put it off till tomorrow, would he still be able to get it? He couldn't imagine these buildings being in the best condition and hadn't really thought until now about the dangers of one of those falling down when he was near one, or worse, inside of one. But wandering around in the dark was a different situation all together.  
食物尚可应付，但水却是另一回事。如果他拖延到明天，还能否得到水呢？他无法想象这些建筑能保持最佳状态，直到此刻才真正考虑到靠近或更糟地置身其中一座倒塌的危险。但在黑暗中徘徊则是完全不同的境况。

'And I'm still worried about her...' thought Shinji as his eyes went to the girl in the strange outfit. He had no idea what her situation was. Whether she was hungry, thirsty, or anything of the sorts, but if the fire did end up going out during the night, then the cold breeze of the ocean would be sure to freeze them quickly. Getting a cold was certainly the last thing he desired right now.  
'我还是担心她...' 新治的目光落在那位身着奇装异服的女孩身上。他完全不了解她的处境，不知道她是否饿了、渴了，或是其他什么情况。但如果夜里的篝火真的熄灭了，那么海风带来的寒意肯定会迅速将他们冻僵。感冒无疑是眼下他最不希望发生的事。

'Water and blankets then,' thought Shinji as he rested his chin in his hand as he looked into the torrent of flames dancing in front of him. As he looked towards the girl, he could see the shadow of the flames flickering off her face. Watching the flames dance across her face for a moment longer, he eventually placed his hands on his knees and pushed himself upwards. Pocketing the lighter which he had placed beside him, he proceeded to venture into the darkened city.  
“那就水和毯子吧。” 碇真嗣一边想着，一边用手托着下巴，凝视着眼前跳跃的火焰洪流。当他望向女孩时，能看到火焰的影子在她脸上闪烁。他又多看了一会儿火焰在她脸上舞动的景象，最终双手撑膝，站起身来。他将放在身旁的打火机揣进口袋，随后踏入了黑暗的城市之中。

Shinji didn't want to walk far; as long as he could see the light of the fire in the distance he wasn't as worried, but the state of the buildings were starting to worry him.  
真嗣并不想走得太远；只要他能看见远处火光的闪烁，他就不那么担心，但建筑物的状况开始让他感到忧虑。

It looked like nuclear fallout had occurred, and every building that he walked by looked as though it had been in a state of disrepair for several years. He did check in several vehicles as he made his way into the city, but didn't find anything he considered useful.  
看起来仿佛发生了核辐射泄漏，他经过的每一栋建筑都像是多年失修的样子。他在进城途中检查了几辆车，但没找到任何他认为有用的东西。

With the lighter in his hand, he passed many stores, most of which didn't seem to even have a scrap of paper left inside it. Whatever had occurred, seemed to have destroyed everything down to the smallest item.  
手中握着打火机，他走过许多店铺，大多数店内似乎连一片纸屑都不剩。无论发生了什么，似乎都将一切摧毁至最微小的物品。

There was one thing that surprised him as he walked around the outskirts of the city, and that seemed that animals were completely unaffected by whatever had happened. As he had passed a car at one point, he saw a dog grabbing something in its mouth, only realizing seconds later that it was a large piece of meat, like the leg of a butchered animal. The dog growled at him however, and Shinji didn't want to press his luck. He may have had the lighter, but he'd rather not get bitten by a wild dog.  
在他漫步于城市边缘时，有一件事让他颇为惊讶，那就是动物们似乎完全不受所发生之事的影响。当他经过一辆车时，看到一只狗正用嘴叼着什么东西，几秒钟后才意识到那是一大块肉，像是屠宰后的动物腿。然而，那狗对他低吼了一声，真嗣并不想冒险。他虽有打火机在手，但更不愿被野狗咬伤。

As the dim light of the fire started to get further and further away, Shinji was just feeling that he was wasting his efforts on something which may not even exist. As he walked past a small store though he turned his head, and paused as he looked into the store. Holding the lighter out in front of himself, he looked past the darkened windows to what was inside.  
随着火光的微弱光芒逐渐远去，真嗣开始觉得自己在为一个可能根本不存在的东西浪费努力。然而，当他走过一家小店时，他转过头，停下脚步向店内望去。他举起打火机照亮前方，透过昏暗的窗户窥视着里面的景象。

The store was better off than most of the others he had passed along the way, and looking at it, Shinji guessed that it had been a sporting goods store of some kind. Carefully walking in between the shattered glass panels of the window, he stepped through the empty window and looked around at the shop.  
这家店铺比他沿途经过的大多数都要好些，环顾四周，真嗣猜测这里曾经是一家体育用品店。他小心翼翼地穿过窗户上破碎的玻璃，跨过空荡荡的窗框，打量着店内。

Most of the shelves were still intact, though with a certain darkened color to the wood, suggesting that it had caught fire. Passing what looked like a twisted cash register, Shinji walked along the aisles peering through the darkness as he did. Twisted pieces of metal, melted rubber, and broken pieces of wood were only some of the things that he passed on his may towards the back of the store. He was hoping to find some sleeping bags, but even that didn't seem very promising.  
大部分货架依旧完好无损，只是木头呈现出一种暗沉的色泽，暗示着它们曾遭受过火灾。经过一个扭曲的收银机，真嗣沿着货架间的小道前行，一边走一边透过黑暗窥视。扭曲的金属片、融化的橡胶和破碎的木块，只是他在前往店铺后部途中所见的一部分景象。他希望能找到一些睡袋，但即便这一点也似乎希望渺茫。

He reached the back of the store, but was met only with a rack of blackened shoes, all too brittle to even pick up. Shaking his head in defeat, he was about to backtrack and head back to the beach when he spotted an employee only sign on a door to the far right of the back wall. He hesitated for a second, thinking things couldn't be much better there than out here but didn't see any reason why he shouldn't at least look. He walked towards to the door and pushed it inwards.  
他来到了商店的后部，却只看到一排烧焦的鞋子，全都脆得连拿起都困难。他无奈地摇了摇头，正准备折返回到海滩时，注意到后墙右侧有一扇门上挂着“员工专用”的牌子。他犹豫了一瞬，心想那里的情况未必比这里好，但又觉得至少应该看看。于是他走向那扇门，推了推。

Except it wouldn't budge.  
然而，门却纹丝不动。

Shinji pushed again, adding more pressure to the door, but even then it wouldn't move an inch. He even tried kicking it, but this was more in frustration than anything.  
真嗣再次用力推门，增加了压力，但门依旧纹丝不动。他甚至尝试踢门，但这更多的是出于沮丧而非实际效果。

With sweat finally starting to run down his cheek, he leaned up against the side of the door and cursed quietly. The roof must have caved in, but if something that could help him did exist back there, he wanted to do everything he could to get it.  
汗水终于开始顺着他的脸颊流下，他靠在门边，低声咒骂。屋顶肯定已经坍塌，但如果那里真的有什么能帮助他的东西，他希望能尽一切可能去获取。

Looking around for something to hit the door with, something perhaps more solid, he spotted a golf club, a driver that hadn't been turned into a chunk of metal. Grabbing it, he walked back over to the door and stood before it with the club held in his hands. Take a few steps back, he lunged forward and swung with all his might against the door. A golf club had certainly never been used like this before. The club made contact with the door and made a large dent in it with a loud hollow sound.  
环顾四周寻找可以用来砸门的硬物，他瞥见了一支高尔夫球杆，一支尚未被砸成金属块的球杆。他抓起球杆，走回门前，双手握住球杆站在那里。后退几步，他猛地向前冲去，用尽全力挥杆击打门板。高尔夫球杆从未被这样使用过。球杆击中门板，发出一声沉闷的巨响，并在上面留下了一个大凹痕。

Stepping back from the door, Shinji swung again, this time cracking the wood and on his third swing, he broke through the wood, creating a sizable hole that he could look through. Throwing the golf club to one side he looked through the hole while holding up the lighter next to him.  
从门前退开，真嗣再次挥杆，这次木门裂开了，第三次挥击时，他打破了木板，制造出一个足够大的洞，可以透过它窥视。他将高尔夫球杆扔到一旁，举起打火机靠近洞口，透过洞口向外张望。

The roof overhead had certainly caved in, and a bunch of the ceiling lay scattered across the room and directly in front of the the door lay several large pieces of wood. But Shinji saw hope in this. He had been afraid that the wood had been piled in front of the door, be he figured that if he swung a few more times at the door, he would be able to push his way through it. He did just that.  
头顶的屋顶确实已经坍塌，一部分天花板碎片散落在房间各处，而门前则横亘着几块大木板。但真嗣在这景象中看到了希望。他原本担心木板会被堆砌在门前，但他推测，只要再多挥几下，就能推开这些障碍。他便如此行动了。

It took ten minutes for him to accomplish this before his hands were blistered and red from clutching the club so tightly, but he finally made it through. Dropping the driver, he pushed his way through the door, wincing slightly as the splinters he had missed dug into his skin and pierced it, making him bleed slightly. He ignored this though, and didn't think anything of it.  
他花了十分钟才完成这一任务，双手因紧握球杆而起泡发红，但最终还是成功了。他丢下球杆，推门而入，那些未被注意到的木刺扎进皮肤，刺痛并让他微微出血，他对此毫不在意，并未多想。

'There better be something worthwhile in this room,' thought Shinji as he waved his lighter around.  
“这房间里最好有值得一看的东西，”真嗣想着，一边挥动着打火机。

The back room seemed to have escaped whatever had vaporized the front room, and a lot of things were still intact. Shinji walked past several shelves, ignoring the many shoe boxes that lined them, searching for anything that could keep them warm tonight.  
后室似乎逃过了前室被蒸发的命运，许多东西都还完好无损。真嗣走过几排货架，对上面堆满的鞋盒视而不见，寻找着今晚能让他们保暖的任何物品。

Passing into another room, the room had caved in on this one as well, but it was worse; part of the wall had caved in as well. Shinji almost all but ignored this room since it was smaller than the previous room which seemed to just be for storing items, but he saw something which made him do a double take. What look the top half of a chair but with its legs snapped off lay on its side amidst the rubble. Walking over to it, he picked it up and held it in his hands.  
穿过另一间房间，这里同样被坍塌的结构所侵占，情况更为严重；部分墙壁也已崩塌。由于这间房比前一间更小，似乎仅用于存放物品，真嗣几乎忽略了它，但他的目光却被某样东西吸引，不禁多看了两眼。那是一把椅子的上半部分，腿已断裂，侧躺在废墟之中。他走过去，拾起它，双手捧着。

"This must have been a break room or something," mumbled Shinji.  
“这以前一定是间休息室之类的，”真嗣喃喃自语。

He now spotted what he had missed before. A small counter ran along one side of the room and what looked like a sink was built into one of the counter tops. Shinji walked up to it and turned on the faucet without much hope. Predictably, not even a drop of water trickled out.  
他现在注意到了之前忽略的东西。房间一侧有一条小吧台，吧台台面上嵌着一个看起来像水槽的东西。真嗣走过去，没抱太大希望地拧开了水龙头。不出所料，连一滴水都没有流出来。

'Should have know better,' he thought. 'But if there is a sink, it wouldn't be too surprising if a small refrigerator was here.'  
"本该更明白的，" 他心想，"但如果这里有水槽，那么有个小冰箱也不足为奇。"

Shinji then started looking around for any speck of white that stood out compared to the grey and brown colors of the wood and roof tiling. It took him some time before he started shifting pieces of wood, looking for any sign of a fridge.  
真嗣开始四处寻找任何一点与众不同的白色，与周围灰褐色的木头和屋顶瓦片形成对比。他花了些时间，才开始挪动木块，寻找冰箱的踪迹。

After moving several medium sized pieces, he finally found it crammed into a corner of the room. It had long ceased functioning, but if Shinji could find water in there, even if it was to last a day, he would be thankful. Tugging open the door, he was met by such a awful smell that it forced him to veer off to the right as he puked.  
在挪动了几件中等大小的物品后，他终于在一个房间的角落里发现了它。它早已停止运转，但如果真嗣能在里面找到水，哪怕只够维持一天，他也会心怀感激。他用力拉开那扇门，迎面而来的恶臭让他不得不向右偏过头去呕吐。

A rat from the looks of it had somehow found itself a way into the fridge and died during the cave in of the roof. The body was twisted and contorted and its fur was already starting to fall off.  
从外表看来，一只老鼠不知怎地找到了进入冰箱的方法，却在屋顶坍塌时丧命。尸体扭曲变形，毛发已经开始脱落。

Shinji hadn't imagined he would have been greeted by something like this, but at least something good had come out of this. Spitting onto the ground, hating the taste of vomit, he looked back into the fridge and stared at the four water bottles in the inside door. Thankfully, the rat was in a far back corner of the fridge so he wouldn't have to go near it. Forcing himself not to puke again, he quickly grabbed the four bottles. Slamming the door closed, he quickly left the room and held his breath until he reached the item storage room before he breathed again.  
真嗣未曾料想会遭遇这样的情景，但至少有件好事从中而来。他朝地上啐了一口，厌恶那呕吐物的味道，回头望向冰箱内门上的四瓶水。谢天谢地，那只老鼠蜷缩在冰箱深处的一角，他无需靠近。强忍着不再呕吐，他迅速抓起那四瓶水。猛地关上冰箱门，他快步离开房间，屏息直至抵达物品储藏室才重新呼吸。

He looked down at the four bottles tucked in his arms and at least thought that it had been worth it in the end. Setting them down on an empty shelf, he looked around the room again. The room seemed to stretch far into the back and he hadn't checked that area yet.  
他低头看着怀里抱着的四瓶酒，至少觉得最终还是值得的。他将它们放在一个空架子上，再次环顾房间。房间似乎向后方延伸得很远，而他还没有检查过那个区域。

He passed an odd assortment of soccer balls and soccer related products before he reached the back of the store. Camping stuff largely littered this area including some fishing poles. Shinji had never been fishing in his life, but supposed that it was something that would be good to learn. He could at least cook whatever he caught. But carrying the fishing poles would be difficult with the bottles also. He'd just have to grab them again at a later date.  
他在抵达店铺后部之前，经过了一系列奇异的足球及周边产品。露营用品主要散落在这个区域，包括一些钓竿。真嗣一生中从未钓过鱼，但他认为这是一项值得学习的好技能。至少他可以烹饪捕获的任何东西。但同时携带钓竿和瓶子会很困难。他只能改天再来取了。

Sifting through some of the other stuff, he saw a bunch of useless camping gear, none of which included a pot or frying pan. The thought of fish had reminded him of how hungry he was.  
他在一堆其他杂物中翻找，发现了一些无用的露营装备，但没有一个是锅或煎锅。想到鱼，他才意识到自己有多饿。

'Well, I found the water at least, so it wasn't too bad I suppose,' sighed Shinji as he stood up and started walking away from the camping goods. He figured that he should start getting back by now. He wanted be sure the fire stayed strong long into the night.  
'好吧，至少我找到了水，所以还不算太糟，我想。' 真嗣叹了口气，站起身来，开始离开露营用品区。他觉得现在应该开始返回了。他想确保火能持续燃烧到深夜。

As he walked past the camping goods though, his eye caught onto something wrapped in plastic that was tucked into a corner. Walking over to it, Shinji pulled it out and realized that it was a dark green sleeping bag. He smiled slightly, but then looked around.  
当他走过露营用品区时，目光被角落里一个用塑料包裹的东西吸引住了。走过去，真嗣把它抽出来，发现那是一条深绿色的睡袋。他微微一笑，但随即环顾四周。

'There's only one,' he thought suddenly.  
“只有一个，”他突然想到。

He stood still for several seconds, his bran registering that phrase. Of course it wouldn't have been that easy.  
他静立了几秒钟，大脑才处理完那句话。当然，事情不会那么简单。

'Damn it,' he thought as he looked around the store again, waving the flickering flame back and forth. As he passed over everything a second time though, he had to admit defeat. He guessed he wouldn't be sleeping much tonight.  
“该死，”他想着，再次环顾店铺，挥动着那摇曳的火光。尽管第二次仔细检查了一遍，他不得不承认失败。看来今晚他别想睡个好觉了。

Walking back to the door he broke through, he carefully placed the sleeping bag through the hole, being sure not to tear it. Next he threw the bottles through and climbed through the hole, ignoring the splinters which pierced his skin again.  
他走回自己破门而入的地方，小心翼翼地将睡袋从洞口塞过去，确保不会撕裂。接着，他把瓶子扔了过去，然后爬过洞口，不顾那些再次刺入皮肤的木刺。

He didn't notice that the cut from earlier had already scabbed over.  
他没有注意到之前的那道伤口已经结痂了。

After returning to the beach, he tossed what he had found from the city in a pile and started stacking more tinder on the fire. It had gone down more than he had suspected and he figured he'd spend most of his night keeping it alive. After getting it back up to a sizable column though, he turned to other matters.  
回到海滩后，他将城市中找到的东西扔成一堆，开始往火堆上添加更多引火物。火势比他预想的要小，他估计自己多半得花上一整夜来维持火种。不过，在重新将其燃成一柱可观的火焰后，他转而处理其他事务。

He had no way of knowing how far off the sunrise was, but had to guess it was getting close to midnight by now. The moon was already high up in the sky and the chilly ocean breeze was starting to hit the beach. Shinji felt himself shiver as he sat in front of the fire. He had always been rather resilient to the cold, so he could manage well enough...but-  
他无从知晓日出还有多久，但估摸着此刻已近午夜。月亮已高悬天际，寒凉的海风开始侵袭沙滩。真嗣坐在篝火前，感到一阵颤抖。他向来对寒冷颇有抵抗力，因此尚能应付...然而——

He looked at the girl across from him on the other side of the fire pit and frowned. From the moment he had gotten the sleeping bag, he knew things would come to this, but he didn't enjoy it anymore. If anything, he hated it even more.  
他看着火坑对面的女孩，皱起了眉头。自从拿到睡袋的那一刻起，他就知道事情会发展到这一步，但他不再感到享受。如果说有什么不同的话，那就是他更加憎恨这种局面了。

Standing up he grabbed one of the water bottles and opened it, letting several drops of water soothe his parched throat. He wanted to be careful with this water in case they may not find anymore for a while. Placing the bottle beside where he had been sitting, he then grabbed the sleeping bag and removed it from the plastic wrap. He unfurled it and let it hang in front of him surprised at how large it actually was.  
他站起身，拿起一瓶水打开，让几滴水滋润他干渴的喉咙。他想要小心使用这些水，以防他们一段时间内找不到更多的水。他把瓶子放在刚才坐的地方旁边，然后拿起睡袋，从塑料包装中取出。他展开睡袋，让它垂在面前，惊讶于它实际上有多大。

Sighing at what he was about to do, he glanced over at the girl, wishing that she would wake up at that moment. But that was just wishful thinking on his part.  
叹息着自己即将要做的事，他瞥了一眼那女孩，希望她此刻能醒来。但那只是他的一厢情愿罢了。

Walking over to her, he knelt down beside her and laid the sleeping bag out, unzipping it and opening it up. Glancing down at her again he paused for several seconds before he took his arm and slid it under her back, his arm digging into the cool sand and gliding across her back. Shinji had been correct in his assumption that her clothes were made out of some strange elastic. He brought his arm upward now, being careful to not jolt her forward suddenly so that her head lulled from side to side. She was oddly heavy for a girl her age, but Shinji attributed this to the fact that she was unconscious. She seemed rather slim as it was. With her now being propped up in a sitting position, Shinji took his other arm and placed it under her thighs before he counted to three, and lifted her gently in the air before setting her down on the warm sleeping bag. He then zipped up the sleeping bag until it was just below her neck and then leaned backwards, letting out a sigh of relief. He had been worried that she may have woken up during the whole ordeal and couldn't imagine things would have gone very well considering what he was doing.  
他走过去，跪在她身边，展开睡袋，拉开拉链并摊开。再次低头看她时，他停顿了几秒，然后伸出手臂，滑到她背后，手臂陷入凉爽的沙子，轻轻拂过她的背。正如真嗣所料，她的衣服是由某种奇特的弹性材料制成。他小心翼翼地抬起手臂，避免突然晃动她的头部，使她的头轻轻摇摆。对于她这个年纪的女孩来说，她异常沉重，但真嗣将其归因于她昏迷不醒。她看起来相当纤细。现在她被扶成坐姿，真嗣用另一只手臂托住她的大腿，数到三后，轻轻将她抬起，放在温暖的睡袋上。接着，他将睡袋拉链拉到她脖子下方，然后向后一靠，松了口气。他担心整个过程中她可能会醒来，考虑到他在做的事情，情况可能不会太好。

Now that she was wrapped in the sleeping bag though, it really seemed that she was sleeping. Her mouth was slightly agape now revealing her white teeth, and Shinji had to look away. He had been very aware of how close he was to her while he had briefly carried her, almost as though she was a baby.  
如今她裹在睡袋里，看起来真的像是睡着了。她的嘴微微张开，露出洁白的牙齿，这让真嗣不得不移开视线。他一直很清楚自己离她有多近，当他短暂地抱着她时，几乎感觉她像个婴儿一样。

'Don't think like that,' Shinji told himself.  
“别这么想，”真嗣对自己说。

Moving away from her, he sat back down on his side of the fire and stared into the flames. Everything that had happened, everything that was going to happen was so distantly removed from Shinji's conscious that he didn't think of anything as he gazed into the fire.  
他离开她，重新坐回火堆自己那边，凝视着火焰。发生的一切，即将发生的一切，都与真嗣的意识如此遥远，以至于他凝视火光时什么也没想。

It was a short time later before he fell asleep.  
不久后，他便睡着了。

Shinji didn't know whether it was the shrill scream, the loud movement of something being dragged across the sand, or that his throat was suddenly being strangled by thin hands that had woken him up. But he did know one thing.  
真嗣不知道是那尖锐的尖叫声、某物在沙地上拖动的巨大声响，还是突然被纤细的手扼住喉咙的感觉唤醒了他。但他确实知道一件事。

The girl was awake. 女孩醒了。

Shinji's eyes flew open as her grasp on his neck tightened, cutting off the much needed oxygen. He hadn't known when he had fallen asleep, but the fire and burned completely out now and the girl seemed to have dragged herself clear across the still smoldering embers. Shinji's eyes squinted as he fought with his brain, willing it to not cause him to pass out as he looked up at the girl choking him. It was the first time he had seen her eyes, and he momentarily forgot that she was trying to kill him. Her eyes were as clear as the sky, as clear as the ocean had once been. Her face was incredibly hard now though, scrunched up in so much anger that it looked like she was going to explode. A dark crease had appeared upon her forehead, and her pupils were wide and shrunken back into her skull. As Shinji continued to stare at her, he realized that tears had started to leak from her eyes.  
碇的眼眸猛然睁开，她的手紧紧扼住他的脖颈，切断了急需的氧气。他不知何时陷入了沉睡，但此刻篝火已完全熄灭，女孩似乎拖着身子穿过了仍在冒烟的余烬。碇眯起眼睛，与大脑抗争，强迫自己不要昏厥，他抬头望着正扼住他咽喉的女孩。这是他第一次见到她的眼睛，那一瞬间他几乎忘记了她正试图置他于死地。她的眼眸清澈如天空，清澈如曾经的海洋。然而她的面容此刻异常坚硬，因愤怒而扭曲，仿佛即将爆发。她的额头上出现了一道深痕，瞳孔放大，深陷于眼窝之中。碇继续凝视着她，意识到泪水开始从她的眼中渗出。

Reality was brought back quickly to him however, as he felt more pressure being put on his neck. She was strong, stronger that he had imagined, and he could feel his vision starting to leave him.  
然而，现实很快将他拉回，因为他感到脖颈上的压力愈发沉重。她比他想象的还要强壮，他能感觉到自己的视线开始模糊。

'Must...do...something,' he thought desperately.  
“必须...做点...什么，”他绝望地想着。

He opened his mouth to try to say something, but his brain wouldn't produce the words properly with the lack of oxygen.  
他张开嘴试图说些什么，但大脑因缺氧而无法正确组织语言。

'Am I...going to die?' he thought as he glanced up at her face stricken with anger.  
“我会...死吗？”他想着，抬头望向她因愤怒而扭曲的脸。

'No...not like this,' he thought suddenly.  
“不……不是这样，”他突然想到。

Forcing his right arm upward, he pressed it roughly into her chest, forcing her backwards and relinquishing the hold on his neck. Taking a quick gulp of air, he turned towards her just in time as she lunged towards him again, reaching for his neck. He batted her hand away this time and took another breathe of air, feeling his entire head spinning with the sudden burst of oxygen. He felt even more like passing out now.  
他强行将右臂向上推，粗暴地按入她的胸口，迫使她后退并松开了对他的颈部束缚。他迅速深吸一口气，就在她再次扑向他、伸手抓向他的脖子时，他及时转身。这次他拍开了她的手，又吸了一口气，突然涌入的氧气让他感到整个脑袋都在旋转。他现在感觉更加晕眩，几乎要昏过去。

Shaking off the feeling he stared back at her who had moved away from him a little now, but was still glaring hatefully at him, her eyes still filled with anger and if Shinji didn't know better, a death glare. He was now wary, not wanting to get up or move at all, so he sat in a sprawled position on the ground.  
他甩开这种感觉，重新看向她，她现在已经稍微远离了他一些，但仍然用充满仇恨的眼神瞪着他，眼中满是愤怒，如果真嗣不了解情况，可能会以为那是死亡凝视。他现在变得谨慎起来，不想起身或移动分毫，于是就那样四肢摊开坐在地上。

The girl glared back at him still; she was crouched in a sitting position, ready incase he decided to run for it. Only problem was, she wasn't confident that she could catch him if he really decided to run. She shifted position a little though, and winced as she did so. Shinji couldn't help but notice this.  
女孩依旧瞪着他，蹲坐在地上，随时准备在他逃跑时追上去。只是问题在于，她并不确信自己能追上他。尽管如此，她还是稍微调整了下姿势，同时疼得皱了皱眉。这一幕被真嗣看在眼里，无法忽视。

He looked where she looked; down around her legs and all the way to her feet were large dark marks, likely the cause of when she had dragged herself across the fire pit. Shinji couldn't imagine the pain from that, but he suddenly thought of something.  
他顺着她的目光看去；她的双腿周围直至脚边，布满了大片深色痕迹，很可能是她拖着自己穿过篝火堆时留下的。真嗣无法想象那有多痛，但突然间他想到了什么。

Standing up, he stood in place for several seconds as he stared back at the girl several paces in front of him. Next second, he took two steps back, and then three steps back. He then turned and looked at the girl and was surprised to see that she hadn't _gotten up_, but was desperately trying to _get up_. She would place both hands on either side of her, and trying pushing her body upward, but her entire lower body didn't seem to want to listen to her.  
他站起身来，目光紧锁前方几步之遥的女孩，静立数秒。下一刻，他向后退了两步，接着又退了三步。随后，他转头望向女孩，惊讶地发现她并未起身，而是拼命想要站起来。她双手分别撑在身体两侧，试图将身体向上推，但她的下半身似乎完全不听使唤。

'Did she injure herself that badly?' thought Shinji. 'Or was the reason she dragged herself across the fire because she couldn't use her legs to begin with?'  
'她伤得那么重吗？' 真嗣心想。'还是说她之所以拖着身子穿过火海，是因为她原本就无法使用双腿？'

Shinji walked several steps backwards again, testing his theory again. The girl seemed to have given up however, and was now attempting to drag herself forward. As she looked up at him however, she seemed to realize that he knew she couldn't chase after him. She glared back at him, her eyes boring into his until her gaze fell and she slowly shifted her legs so that they were in front of him. The were as heavy as lead, but if she touched them, she couldn't feel any sensation.  
真嗣再次后退了几步，再次验证他的猜想。然而，女孩似乎已经放弃了追逐，现在正试图拖着自己向前移动。但当她抬头看向他时，似乎意识到他已经知道她无法追赶上来。她瞪着他，目光如炬，直到视线低垂，她缓缓调整双腿，让它们横亘在他面前。它们沉重如铅，但当她触碰时，却感觉不到任何知觉。

As Shinji watched this pitifulness, he couldn't help but feel sorry for her as she dragged her legs around so she could sit properly. He was even beginning to wish she had just stayed asleep now that she was awake, and apparently wanted to kill him for some reason.  
当真嗣目睹这一幕可怜兮兮的情景时，看到她费力地拖着双腿以便能端正坐好，他不禁为她感到难过。甚至开始希望她还不如继续睡着，毕竟她现在醒了，还不知为何明显想要杀他。

As the girl finally managed to become comfortable, she redirected her gaze at Shinji as he stood in front of her. She hating this feeling of being completely merciless in front of some stranger she didn't even know. To wake up and find somebody asleep close to her, without knowing anything about them or what they had possibly done. It made her so sick she wanted to puke.  
当女孩终于设法感到自在时，她重新将目光投向站在她面前的真嗣。她讨厌这种在完全陌生的人面前毫无防备的感觉，一个她甚至不认识的陌生人。醒来时发现有人睡在身边，却对他们一无所知，也不知道他们可能做过什么。这让她恶心得想吐。

Shinji watched her silently, his hands at his sides. He was unsure what to do in a situation like this. Having never gotten along well with humans in general, having a girl suddenly try to strangle him to death was a situation he hadn't imagined himself being in.  
真嗣默默地注视着她，双手垂在身侧。他不知道在这种情况下该怎么做。一直以来与人类相处得并不融洽，突然有个女孩试图勒死他，这种情形他从未设想过会发生在自己身上。

'We can't just stay like this forever though,' thought Shinji as he sighed.  
"我们不能就这样永远待下去啊。" 真嗣叹了口气，心想。

Resigning to that fact, he sat down slowly, make sure the girl wouldn't try to go after him as he did this. She seemed to be somewhat surprised that he was sitting down now though, as her eyes widened slightly, but then quickly went back to that death stare.  
无奈接受这一事实，他缓缓坐下，确保女孩不会趁机追上来。她似乎对他此刻坐下的举动有些惊讶，眼睛微微睁大，但很快又恢复了那副死寂的凝视。

They sat across from each other now, both watching each other. The girl had been initially surprised that Shinji hadn't just ran away, letting her die in that undignified way. But instead he had sat down, bringing himself down to her level. That pissed her off even more though; he was pitying her.  
他们现在面对面坐着，彼此凝视。女孩起初对真嗣没有直接逃跑，任由她以那种不体面的方式死去感到惊讶。但他却坐了下来，让自己与她平视。这让她更加恼火；他在怜悯她。

'I have to say something,' thought Shinji. 'But what do I say to this girl who just tried to kill me?'  
'我得说点什么，' 真嗣心想。'但对刚刚试图杀我的这个女孩，我该说什么呢？'

Shinji didn't have a clue what to do, but didn't think this was a time to introduce himself. Looking back at her, he saw that her gaze had switched to her legs. She was examining them slowly, moving her hands over the black burns across her legs and feet. She seemed slightly more calm now as she did this, but Shinji noticed that her right eye kept flickering back to him.  
真嗣完全不知道该怎么办，但觉得现在不是自我介绍的时候。他回头看她，发现她的目光已经转向了自己的双腿。她慢慢地检查着，双手在腿上和脚上的黑色烧伤处来回移动。这样做似乎让她稍微平静了一些，但真嗣注意到她的右眼不时地瞥向他。

'She doesn't trust me,' thought Shinji. He should have expected this somewhat, and rather wished he hadn't fallen asleep.  
“她不信任我，”真嗣心想。他本该预料到这一点的，更希望自己没有睡着。

Though an idea came to him then.  
虽然那时他脑海中闪过一个念头。

Standing up again, the girls head came whipping around as her eyes locked on him, watching his every movement. Shinji watched her calmly before he started walking along in a wide half circle around the right side of her; her head followed him as he walked. Walking in a wide arc, he walked all the way around her to the point that she was desperately trying to look behind her but unable to see without repositioning her body. She stopped though as he came back into her field of wish. In his hands he held two bottles.  
再次站起身，女孩的头猛地转向他，目光紧锁在他身上，观察着他的一举一动。真嗣平静地注视着她，然后开始沿着她的右侧走一个大半圆；她的头随着他的步伐转动。他以一个大弧度绕行，直到她拼命想看向身后却无法在不调整身体的情况下看到。然而，当他重新进入她的视野时，她停了下来。他的手中拿着两瓶水。

Shinji sat down again several paces in front of her and placed both water bottles next to him before he open his and took a draught out of it. The water felt cool as it slid down his throat which was still sore from when she had been choking him. Setting down his bottle, he looked across at her and saw that she wasn't looking at him angrily anymore. Her expression was one of confusion.  
真嗣再次坐下，与她相隔几步之遥，将两瓶水放在身边，然后打开自己的那瓶，喝了一口。水流过他因她之前的窒息而仍感疼痛的喉咙，带来一丝凉意。放下水瓶，他望向她，发现她不再以愤怒的眼神看着他。她的表情充满了困惑。

'What is wrong with her?' wondered Shinji almost somewhat amusedly.  
"'她怎么了？' 真嗣几乎有些好笑地想着。

Shinji waited several more seconds before he picked up the other water bottle he had brought, and rolled it across the sand; the bottle bumped gently into the girls knee. She stared down at it for several seconds, her face a mixture of expressions.  
真嗣又等了几秒钟，然后拿起他带来的另一瓶水，滚过沙地；瓶子轻轻撞到了女孩的膝盖。她低头盯着它看了几秒钟，脸上表情复杂。

"Drink it," said Shinji tonelessly.  
“喝吧，”真嗣面无表情地说。

The girls eyes darted towards him, surprised to hear a human voice. Shinji stared back and nodded his head slowly. The girl looked back down at the water bottle before picking it up in her hands. She looked at the cap for several seconds before determining it hadn't been opened before. Quickly opening it, she took several long swallows, just realizing then how thirsty she was. The water slid down her throat, moistening her lips in the process until she paused and removed the bottle from her lips. She slowly set the bottle down next to her, but didn't remove her grip on the bottle. She looked back at Shinji then, a frown on her face.  
女孩的目光迅速转向他，惊讶于听到人类的声音。真嗣回望着她，缓缓点头。女孩再次低头看向水瓶，然后将其拿起。她盯着瓶盖看了几秒，确认未曾被打开过。迅速旋开瓶盖，她连喝了几大口，这才意识到自己有多渴。水滑过喉咙，滋润着她的双唇，直到她停下，将瓶子从唇边移开。她慢慢将水瓶放在身旁，但并未松开握瓶的手。随后，她再次看向真嗣，眉头微皱。

'Is it really that strange for someone to do something like this?' thought Shinji as he looked back at her. He hadn't really expected to receive words of thanks, but knowing that she could at least talk would have been something.  
"有人这么做真的很奇怪吗？" 真嗣想着，回头看向她。他并没有真的期待听到感谢的话语，但知道她至少能开口说话，也算是件好事。

Ignoring this, he raised his own bottle to lips and was about to take a drink when-  
他对此置之不理，举起自己的瓶子送到唇边，正要喝上一口时——

"Where are we?" asked the girl with a clear voice.  
“我们在哪儿？”女孩用清脆的声音问道。

Shinji looked at her for a second through his raised bottle before he lowered it slowly and looked back at her. She was looking determinedly at him now.  
真嗣透过举起的酒瓶看了她一秒钟，然后慢慢放下酒瓶，再次看向她。她此刻正坚定地注视着他。

Shinji took several seconds to reply until he looked across the beach to the bloodied ocean and said-  
真嗣过了几秒才回答，他望向染血的海岸线，说道——

"Tokyo-3, I think." “第三新东京市，我想。”

His eyes darted back to her as he said this, he saw that her eyes had widened slightly as he said this. Was she equally confused and surprised as he was by this, or did her eyes hold a different meaning?  
他说这话时，目光迅速回到她身上，发现她的眼睛微微睁大了。她是否也像他一样感到困惑和惊讶，还是她的眼神蕴含着不同的含义？

They sat in silence again, sipping there water quietly, but as Shinji quickly noticed, both bottles had almost been emptied already. Looks like he'd be looking for more water before the day ended. So much for saving it.  
他们再次静静地坐着，小口啜饮着水，但正如真嗣很快注意到的那样，两个瓶子几乎都快空了。看来今天结束前他得去找更多的水了。省水的计划算是泡汤了。

"Why is no one here?" asked the girl again.  
“为什么这里一个人都没有？”女孩再次问道。

Shinji turned towards her and replied, "I don't know. You're the only other person I've seen, and I was up in the city for these,' he said as he gestured to the water bottles.  
真嗣转向她，回答道：“我不知道。你是除了我之外唯一见过的人，而我之前在城里就是为了这些。”他说着，指了指那些水瓶。

The girl looked at him for several seconds before she turned away from him. Shinji thought he might have seen her mutter something under her breath, but he couldn't hear what it was.  
女孩盯着他看了几秒钟，然后转过身去。真嗣觉得他可能看到她在低声嘀咕什么，但他没听清内容。

Looking at her legs he couldn't think of anything else to say so he asked, "How are your legs?"  
看着她的双腿，他想不出还有什么可说的，于是问道：“你的腿怎么样了？”

The girl glared back at him for a few seconds, not enjoying the question, but he already knew that she couldn't move, so ignoring it was pointless.  
女孩瞪了他几秒钟，不喜欢这个问题，但他已经知道她动不了，所以无视它是没有意义的。

"I can't move them." “我动不了它们。”

Shinji already knew this, but he still pressed the subject.  
真嗣其实已经知道这一点，但他还是继续追问。

"Were they already like that before you-"  
“在你之前，他们就已经那样了吗？”

Shinji hesitated; he had been about to say before you tried strangling me.  
真嗣犹豫了一下；他本想说在你试图勒死我之前。

"-before you crawled across the fire."  
"-在你爬过火堆之前。"

The girl continued glaring at him, but eventually replied, "They were already like this."  
女孩继续瞪着他，但最终回答道，"它们本来就是这样的。"

Shinji didn't think that pushing this further would do any good. Admittedly though, her being basically crippled was a problem, and he was worried about her legs, but if she didn't want to talk about it, he would just wait. He could understand that, as he certainly had things he didn't want to talk about.  
真嗣不认为继续追问会有什么好处。不过，她几乎瘫痪的状况确实是个问题，他对她的双腿感到担忧，但如果她不想谈，他会耐心等待。他理解这一点，因为他自己也有不想提及的事情。

Shinji stood up then, stretching his body and relieving the tension that was building between them just now. The girl watched him silently as he walked several paces away from her towards the ocean. She let out a small sigh herself then; she had been incredibly nervous since the moment she had awoken.  
真嗣随后站起身来，伸展身体，缓解了刚才两人之间的紧张气氛。女孩默默地看着他走向海边，离她几步之遥。她自己也轻轻叹了口气；自从醒来那一刻起，她就一直非常紧张。

Shinji looked out across the ocean for several more seconds before he walked back to where the girl sat. She watched him as he passed by her and started walking towards the slope to the right of where they had sat. She shifted her body slightly, watching as he climbed the hill and was momentarily thinking that he was walking away, that he had made a decision to leave her when he bent over and picked something up. Several seconds later, he came jogging back down the hill, his arms filled with dry brush.  
真嗣又凝视了一会儿海面，才转身走向女孩坐着的地方。她注视着他从身边经过，开始朝他们所坐之处右侧的斜坡走去。她微微调整了姿势，看着他爬上山丘，心中掠过一丝念头，以为他要离开，决定抛下她，然而他却弯腰捡起了什么。几秒钟后，他抱着一捆干枯的灌木，小跑着下了山坡。

The words 'what are you doing,' were half formed in her mouth before her hand brushed against something. Picking it up, she realized it was a lighter, and understood then what he was doing.  
她刚要开口问“你在做什么”，手却无意间触碰到了什么东西。拾起一看，是个打火机，她这才明白他在做什么。

Shinji walked back several seconds later with his arms full of dried drift wood. Dropping everything on the ground, he was about to look for the lighter when he realized it was in the girls hands. There eyes met, and for several seconds, Shinji was afraid that she wasn't going to give it to him. Silently, he held his hand out asking for it. He knew she must understand what he was doing by now, but was never truly sure whether sure she would give it to him. It took her several seconds until she dropped the lighter in his hands wordlessly.  
几秒钟后，真嗣抱着满怀的干漂流木回来了。他将所有东西扔在地上，正准备找打火机时，才发现它在女孩手里。他们的目光相遇，有那么几秒钟，真嗣担心她不会把打火机给他。他默默地伸出手，示意她递过来。他知道她现在肯定明白他的意图，但始终不确定她是否会给他。她犹豫了几秒钟，终于无声地将打火机放在他手中。

Shinji didn't bother saying thanks, as he knew she had been close to not giving it to him. Was she that unable to trust him?  
真嗣没有费心道谢，因为他知道她差点就没给他。她真的那么不信任他吗？

Lighting the fire quickly, he stood back for several seconds watching as the flames licked the wood. Across from him, the girl stared into the flames.  
他迅速点燃了火，后退几步，注视着火焰舔舐木柴。对面，女孩凝视着火光。

Looking down at her, Shinji thought, 'This is a good a time as any I suppose.'  
低头看着她，真嗣心想，'我想这正是时候吧。'

Sitting down across the fire from her, Shinji placed his hands on his knees and said, "Look...as much as you don't trust me, and I have to say, I don't really trust you either, we seem to be the only two people in the entire city. What I guess I'm trying to say is...we have to at least stay together until we're able to find more people."  
坐在火堆对面，真嗣将双手放在膝盖上，说道：“听着……尽管你不太信任我，我得承认，我对你也没多少信任，但我们似乎是这座城市里仅有的两个人。我想说的是……在我们找到更多人之前，至少得待在一起。”

"And if nobody else comes?" asked the girl, her voice suddenly growing in volume.  
"如果其他人都不来呢？"女孩问道，声音突然提高了。

Shinji was trying to be optimistic, but the way she said that made him pissed off for some reason.  
真嗣试图保持乐观，但她那番话不知为何让他莫名恼火。

"You don't believe anybody else will come?"  
“你不相信还会有人来吗？”

The girl didn't reply, already having spoken her mind.  
女孩没有回答，她已经表达了自己的想法。

Shinji stared back at her for a few seconds, wondering what could possibly have made her so inept in dealing with other people. He wasn't a role model by any means, but he at least did want to survive.  
真嗣盯着她看了几秒，心中疑惑究竟是什么让她在与人相处时如此笨拙。他自知绝非榜样，但至少他确实渴望生存。

After several seconds of silence, Shinji finally opened his mouth and muttered, "Shinji...Shinji is my name."  
沉默了几秒后，真嗣终于张开嘴，低声说道：“真嗣……真嗣是我的名字。”

The girl slowly raised her head and looked back at him. Her face was blank as she stared back at him.  
女孩缓缓抬起头，回头望向他。她面无表情地凝视着他。

Her small mouth eventually opened as she replied, "Asuka, is mine."  
她的小嘴终于张开，回答道：“这是明日香的。”

They both looked into the fire for several seconds before Shinji stood up and grabbed the sleeping bag and walked around the fire. The girl, Asuka, watched him as he did this and was momentarily surprised when he handed it to her.  
他们俩都盯着火堆看了几秒钟，随后真嗣站起身，抓起睡袋绕过火堆走去。女孩，明日香，看着他这么做，当真嗣将睡袋递给她时，她一时有些惊讶。

"Wrap yourself in this," Shinji said.  
"用这个把自己裹起来，" 真嗣说道。

Asuka watched his eyes for several seconds, searching for any hint of malicious intent in his eyes, though she couldn't find anything. She didn't really like accepting this from him, but she took it all the same.  
明日香盯着他的眼睛看了好几秒，试图从中寻找一丝恶意，却一无所获。她其实并不喜欢接受他的这份好意，但还是接了过来。

Shinji then walked to where he had been sitting, and bent down and grabbed the lighter before he stood up again.  
真嗣随后走向他之前坐的地方，弯腰捡起打火机，然后再次站直身子。

"Though it is still early in the morning, I'm going to enter the city again. By tonight both water bottles will be gone and I can search in daylight better than night anyways."  
虽然清晨尚早，我打算再次进城。到今晚，两个水壶的水都将耗尽，无论如何，白天的搜索总比夜晚更有效。

As he started walking towards the slope, Shinji said, "Don't try moving much either. Your legs will recover faster if you let them sit."
当他开始向山坡走去时，信治说："也别试着多动。如果你让它们静静地坐着，你的腿会恢复得更快。"

Asuka was just about to open her mouth and say something though when she stopped herself. What point was there in arguing with him anyway.  
明日香正要张嘴说些什么，却又突然打住了。反正跟他争论又有什么意义呢。

"I'll be back in a few hours," said Shinji as he reached the top of the slope and disappeared in a few hours.  
“我几个小时后就回来，”真嗣说着，到达坡顶后便消失了。

'Like I'll believe that,' thought Asuka as she looked into the fire. She had noticed that he had taken the lighter with him.  
'我才不信呢，'明日香一边凝视着火焰一边想。她注意到他已经把打火机带走了。

She slowly wrapped her body in the blanket, even managing to place her legs in them. She remembered when she had woken up, and had at first thought that she was in her bed back home in Germany. Everything had been incredibly warm, but then something, a cold breeze most likely had hit her. She then noticed that she was on sand, and in a sleeping bag. She had looked around and her eyes had quickly snapped to that boy. It was only a few seconds before she was on top of him, trying to break his neck. She wondered why he hadn't brought that up yet.  
她慢慢地用毯子裹住身体，甚至设法把腿也放进去。她记得自己醒来时，起初以为自己躺在德国家里的床上。一切都非常温暖，但随后有什么东西，可能是冷风，吹到了她。她这才注意到自己躺在沙滩上，睡在睡袋里。她环顾四周，目光很快落在了那个男孩身上。仅仅几秒钟后，她就扑到他身上，试图扭断他的脖子。她不知道他为什么还没提起这件事。

'Probably waiting till I fall asleep to do something,' thought Asuka. She shivered at the thought. No, she couldn't fall asleep, not in case he did end up coming back.  
'可能是在等我睡着后搞什么鬼，'明日香心想。想到这里，她不禁打了个寒颤。不，她不能睡着，万一他真的回来了怎么办。

She shifted positions, forcing herself to become less comfortable, but the combination of the sleeping bag and fire were making her eyes start to droop.  
她调整了姿势，强迫自己变得不那么舒适，但睡袋和篝火的组合让她的眼皮开始沉重。

'Can't...sleep,' muttered Asuka.  
'不能...睡，'明日香喃喃自语。

It was moments later when her head drooped onto her chest, and she fell deeply asleep.  
片刻之后，她的头垂落在胸前，深深地进入了梦乡。

It took Asuka several seconds to remember where she was when she awoke, but when she did, she sat bolt upright.  
当明日香醒来时，她花了好几秒钟才想起自己身在何处，但一旦记起，她便猛地坐直了身子。

"Oh...you awake?" "哦...你醒了？"

Her head darted to her left and saw Shinji walking over to the fire, several more pieces of wood in his arms.  
她迅速转向左边，看到真嗣抱着几根木柴走向火堆。

Her mouth opened against her will and she stammered, "You're back?"  
她的嘴不由自主地张开，结巴道：“你回来了？”

"I was gone for several hours and have been back for several, you've just been sleeping this whole time."  
“我离开了几个小时，回来也已经有好几个小时了，你一直都在睡觉。”

Asuka opened her mouth again, but this time clamped it closed and turned towards the fire, but only now realized it was extinguished.  
明日香再次张开了嘴，但这次她紧紧闭上，转向了火堆，却直到此刻才意识到火已经熄灭了。

"No need for a fire right now with the sun as it is," said Shinji.  
“现在太阳这么好，不需要生火。” 真嗣说道。

Asuka looked up into the sky and saw that he was right. The sun was high in the sky, indicating that it was noon or a little after.  
明日香抬头望向天空，发现他说得没错。太阳高悬，表明已是正午或稍晚些时候。

"I found more water," said Shinji as he pointed to several more bottles next to the fire. Asuka stared at these and then back at Shinji, confused by what she was seeing.  
"我找到了更多水，" 真嗣指着火堆旁的几瓶水说道。明日香盯着这些水瓶，又回头看向真嗣，对眼前所见感到困惑。

"Why did you come back?" she eventually asked.  
"你为什么回来？" 她最终问道。

Shinji set the wood down beside the fire pit and then looked at her, a frown on his face.  
真嗣将木头放在篝火旁，然后看着她，脸上带着一丝不悦。

"Why wouldn't I?" “我为什么不会呢？”

Asuka didn't reply, feeling like she would have rather not asked.  
明日香没有回答，感觉自己宁愿没有问出口。

"Its not like I gain anything from leaving you."  
“我离开你又没有什么好处。”

"So you would if you could gain something!" Her voice was suddenly harsh.  
“所以如果有利可图你就会离开！”她的声音突然变得尖锐。

Shinji shook his head and replied, "I didn't say that, and I wouldn't do that."  
真嗣摇了摇头，回答道：“我没那么说，也不会那么做。”

Asuka shut up briefly, but Shinji could tell that she was still seething about this. He couldn't understand this girl.  
明日香短暂地沉默了，但真嗣能感觉到她对此仍怒火中烧。他无法理解这个女孩。

Walking around the other side of the fire pit, he sat down and opened one of the water bottles. Taking several swigs, he set it down and saw that she was staring at him intently. Wiping his mouth he let out a sigh and asked, "Is your leg any better?"  
绕过篝火的另一侧，他坐了下来，打开一瓶水。连喝了几口后，他将水瓶放下，发现她正目不转睛地盯着他。他擦了擦嘴，叹了口气问道：“你的腿好些了吗？”

Asuka ignored him for for a while before she muttered, "No."  
明日香无视了他一会儿，然后低声咕哝道：“不。”

'At least she's talking,' thought Shinji.  
"“至少她开始说话了。”真嗣心想。

"We'll we should at least clean up the burn marks from the cinders."  
"我们至少应该清理一下从煤渣上留下的烧痕。"

Shinji made to stand up, but was quickly rebutted by Asuka.  
真嗣正要站起来，但很快被明日香反驳了。

"Don't bother, I'll do it myself."  
"别费心了，我自己来。"

"With what? You're are not using the water in the bottles to clean those burns."  
"用什么？你不会是用瓶子里的水来清洗那些烧伤吧。"

"Who said I was gonna use those?"  
"谁说我打算用那些？"

"Then what? Ocean water won't help you."  
"那又怎样？海水可帮不了你。"

Asuka paused; she was going to use the water from the ocean.  
明日香停顿了一下；她打算用海水。

"I can deal with the salt."  
我能处理这盐。

"I wasn't talking about that, the ocean isn't...the water is something different, some strange liquid that smells like blood. You can even smell it from here."  
“我不是在说那个，海洋不是……水是另一种东西，某种闻起来像血的奇怪液体。你甚至从这儿都能闻到。”

Now that Asuka thought about it, he was right. She could smell it from here, the stench of LCL fluid. She had become so accustomed to it that she hardly noticed it. But why had the Bay of Tokyo-3 turned to LCL fluid? Or was it just like she had thought when this boy told her they were in the remnants of Tokyo-3?  
现在想来，他说的没错。她从这里就能闻到那股味道，LCL 溶液的恶臭。她已经习惯了，几乎察觉不到。但为什么东京-3 湾会变成 LCL 溶液呢？还是说，就像这个男孩告诉她他们在东京-3 废墟中时她所想的那样？

Letting out a sigh, Asuka grabbed the empty water bottle and threw it at Shinji. "Just fill this with the stuff in the ocean. Who cares what it is."  
叹了口气，明日香抓起空水瓶朝真嗣扔去。“直接用海里的水装满就行了。管它是什么。”

"But it could harm you."  
“但它可能会伤害你。”

'If it could harm me I'd be dead by now,' thought Asuka snidely.  
“如果它能伤害我，我现在早就死了，”明日香尖刻地想道。

"Don't worry about it," said Asuka as she waved him off. "Just get the stuff and I'll do the rest."  
"别担心，" 明日香一边挥手让他离开，一边说。"把东西拿来，剩下的我来搞定。"

Shinji stared at her for several more seconds, wondering why she was so positive that the stuff was fine.  
真嗣又盯着她看了几秒钟，不明白她为什么如此确信那东西没问题。

"Okay," he said eventually.  
"好吧，" 他最终说道。

It took him only a few minutes to fill the bottle when he reached the ocean. It was strange, it felt like sand when he ran his hands through it, but it clearly fit in the bottle as a liquid.  
当他到达海边时，只用了几分钟就装满了瓶子。这很奇怪，当他用手拨弄时，感觉像沙子，但它显然以液体的形式装进了瓶子里。

Taking it back to Asuka, he handed her the bottle and she quickly opened it and spread it on her outstretched leg. She immediately winced.  
他带着瓶子回到明日香那里，递给她，她迅速打开瓶盖，将其涂抹在她伸出的腿上。她立刻皱起了眉头。

"Does it hurt?" asked Shinji.  
“疼吗？” 真嗣问道。

Asuka took a few seconds to reply.  
明日香顿了几秒才回答。

"Yes, but thats because of the salt."  
"是的，但那是因为盐。"

"Salt?" "盐？"

"The salt from the ocean mixed with this stuff."  
海水中的盐分与这种物质混合在一起。

"So thats why it felt like sand," mumbled Shinji.  
“所以才感觉像沙子啊。” 真嗣喃喃自语道。

"Most likely," replied Asuka, 'though several of its other properties probably caused that affect,' she thought silently.  
"很有可能，"明日香回答道，'尽管它的其他特性可能也导致了这种影响，'她默默地想。

It didn't take long for Asuka to clean the burns on her legs; thankfully they weren't that bad, but her legs still wouldn't move.  
没过多久，明日香就清理好了腿上的烧伤；幸好伤势并不严重，但她的双腿依旧无法动弹。

The day passed slowly afterwards and Shinji and Asuka barely talked to each other during this time. Shinji was constantly keeping the fire burning, wanting to keep his mind occupied with something, while Asuka seemed to have been lost in her own thoughts, curled in the warmth of the sleeping bag.  
那天之后，时间过得异常缓慢，真嗣和明日香在这期间几乎没有交谈。真嗣不停地维持着火堆燃烧，试图用忙碌来占据自己的思绪，而明日香似乎沉浸在自己的思绪中，蜷缩在睡袋的温暖里。

The sun began sinking across the ocean eventually and Asuka opened her eyes and turned towards it. Shinji, who had thought she had been asleep turned towards her and was momentarily surprised at how beautiful she looked with the orange and red rays of the sun hitting her face.  
太阳开始缓缓沉入海平线，最终，明日香睁开了双眼，转向夕阳。真嗣原以为她已经睡着了，便也转头看向她，一时间被夕阳橙红的光芒映照在她脸上的美丽模样所惊艳。

"What exactly are we going to do now?" asked Asuka suddenly as she turned back towards the fire.  
“我们现在到底要做什么？”明日香突然转身面向火堆问道。

Shinji didn't know himself, which was the problem. He had been maintaining his sanity be doing everything by the moment, by the minute, and by the hour. If he had to think about the days to come, he wasn't sure what they would do. They couldn't just keep living like this.  
真嗣自己也不知道，这就是问题所在。他一直靠按部就班、分秒必争来维持理智。如果让他考虑未来的日子，他不确定他们会怎么做。他们不能就这样一直生活下去。

Shinji's stomach rumbled then, and he was reminded of his hunger once again. He hadn't found food again today, which was growing to be a problem. If he didn't find any tomorrow...  
那时，真嗣的肚子咕噜作响，再次提醒了他饥饿的感觉。今天他又没找到食物，这逐渐成了个问题。如果明天还找不到...

"I don't know," replied Shinji slowly.  
“我不知道，”真嗣缓缓回答道。

'And here I thought you had a solution to everything,' thought Asuka bitterly. But at the same time, she realized just how worried Shinji was about things, even if he didn't say anything. She supposed that it had been different for him when he had found himself here, all by himself until he found her. But even then he didn't know whether she would awake. If she had been in his position...  
“我还以为你什么问题都有办法解决呢，”明日香苦涩地想着。但与此同时，她意识到真嗣对事情的担忧有多深，即使他什么都没说。她猜想当他独自一人来到这里，直到找到她之前，他的处境一定很不同。但即便如此，他也不确定她是否会醒来。如果她处在他的位置……

"Can I ask you something?" asked Shinji suddenly.  
"我能问你件事吗？" 真嗣突然问道。

"...What?" replied Asuka after a seconds pause.  
"……什么？" 明日香顿了几秒后回答。

"Why did you trying killing me?"  
“你为什么要杀我？”

Asuka had been waiting for this question from him and had been surprised that it hadn't come sooner.  
明日香一直在等他问这个问题，惊讶的是他居然到现在才问。

"How would you have reacted if you were in my place?"  
"如果你处在我的位置，你会怎么反应？"

"...What do you mean?" "...你是什么意思？"

"Waking up without any idea where you were with some boy sleeping across from you."  
“醒来时完全不知道自己在哪里，对面还躺着一个男孩。”

'Isn't choking someone still going too far?' thought Shinji.  
"“掐住别人脖子是不是还是太过分了？”真嗣心想。

Asuka didn't want to spell it out for him though, so she didn't. If he didn't understand what she was getting at, it was better that way. The less he knew about her, the better.  
明日香并不想明说，所以她没有。如果他不明白她的暗示，这样反而更好。他了解得越少，对她越有利。

The sun across the horizon set and in several short hours, a new day would be starting.  
太阳横跨地平线缓缓落下，短短几个小时后，新的一天即将开始。

Asuka rolled over, facing away from the fire and covered herself from head to toe in the sleeping back. The plug suit didn't make sleeping particularly comfortable, but it was something she had wondered about before. She couldn't remember wearing her plug suit or going in for any tests before this all happened. She couldn't really remember much of what she had done during that day was the problem.  
明日香翻了个身，背对着火堆，将整个人从头到脚裹进睡袋里。插入栓服并不适合睡眠，这一点她之前也考虑过。她记不清在这场变故之前是否穿过插入栓服或进行过任何测试。问题在于，她几乎记不起那天自己做了些什么。

Shinji continued sitting in front of the fire, his head resting in his hands. He had gotten a headache sometime during the past hour, and hoped that it would subside sooner or later. He was unwillingly thinking about tomorrow and what it would bring. Asuka's leg didn't seem to be getting any better, so they would have to stay on the beach for a while. If he was honest, he would have preferred to have found a place to stay in the city; at least it would be close to more supplies.  
真嗣继续坐在火堆前，双手托着头。过去的一个小时里，他的头开始隐隐作痛，希望这痛楚能早点消退。他不由自主地思考着明天会带来什么。明日香的腿似乎没有好转的迹象，所以他们还得在海滩上逗留一段时间。老实说，他更希望能找到城市里的落脚点；至少那里离补给更近一些。

Placing more wood onto the fire, he lay down on the cool sand and rolled onto his back so that he was looking up at the sky. It was still hard to comprehend what had happened, since it felt like he had been sitting in a classroom until just a little while ago. But things were as they were.  
往火堆里添了些木柴，他躺在凉爽的沙地上，翻身仰面朝天，凝视着天空。这一切仍难以置信，仿佛不久前他还坐在教室里。但事实就是如此。

It took both Shinji and Asuka a long time to fall asleep that first night that they were together, mainly because both were still a bit wary of the other, but when they finally did, it was almost in unison.  
那第一晚，真嗣和明日香花了很长时间才入睡，主要是因为两人对彼此仍有些许戒备，但当他们最终睡着时，几乎是同时的。

### Chapter 3: Conflict

This chapter has long been in the works but I've finally gotten it done. I don't think I'll be updating again until December when I'll actually have some free time so hopefully this holds everyone over until then.

这部 chapter 已经筹备已久，但我终于完成了。我想在十二月之前不会再更新了，那时我才有真正的空闲时间，希望这段时间大家能耐心等待。

Asuka was the first to wake that next morning, and at first, she almost reacted exactly as she did the previous day.

第二天早上，是明日香第一个醒来，起初，她的反应几乎和前一天一模一样。

Her eyes opened slowly with her eyelashes fluttering softly. She was bundled up warmly in the sleeping bag, but the cold breeze that blew against her exposed face awoke her slowly. She turned to her right, and what remaining drowsiness remained disappeared in an instance. She saw Shinji, or his back to be precise, turned away from her. She might have tried strangling him again if it wasn't for the fact that the fire was still burning heavily in-between them.

她的眼帘缓缓张开，睫毛轻轻颤动。她裹在温暖的睡袋里，但拂过裸露脸颊的寒风逐渐唤醒了她。她转向右侧，残留的睡意瞬间消失。她看到了真嗣，准确地说是他的背影，背对着她。若非两人之间熊熊燃烧的篝火，她或许会再次试图勒住他。

She let out a sigh then and turned away from him; she hated being as helpless as she was.

她随后叹了口气，转过身去；她讨厌自己如此无助。

The sun which had been low on the horizon when Asuka had awoken was now starting to rise in the sky, casting shadows across the water as the sun beat down on the capsized battleships that littered the coastline. Asuka drifted in and out of sleep during this time, but felt restless now. It almost felt like she had been sleeping for years.

当明日香醒来时，太阳还低悬在地平线上，如今已开始升起，阳光洒在倾覆的战舰上，投下斑驳的阴影。明日香在这段时间里时睡时醒，但此刻感到焦躁不安。仿佛她已经沉睡了多年。

She heard movement beside her eventually though, and saw Shinji slowly rising from where he sat. He rubbed his eyes gently as he washed the weariness from his body and sat upright with his legs crisscrossed. Turning towards Asuka, he saw that she was already awake.

她最终听到了身旁的动静，看到真嗣缓缓地从坐着的地方起身。他轻轻揉着眼睛，洗去身体的疲惫，双腿交叉盘坐，挺直了身子。转向明日香，他发现她已经醒了。

"You're awake already?" said Shinji somewhat surprised.

“你已经醒了？”真嗣有些惊讶地说。

Asuka paused for a second before she said, "I've been up for a while."

明日香停顿了一下，然后说：“我已经醒了一会儿了。”

It was Shinji's turn to be silent now. He had thought about it last night, whether she would try anything again like the day before. At least he could trust her to not try killing him again.

轮到真嗣沉默了。他昨晚就考虑过，她是否会像前一天那样再次尝试什么。至少他可以相信她不会再试图杀他了。

"Your legs still the same?" he asked.

“你的腿还是那样吗？”他问道。

Asuka nodded again. 明日香再次点头。

"I see," replied Shinji dejectedly.

"我明白了，" 真嗣沮丧地回答道。

"Well sorry to slow you down," said Asuka, growing haughty suddenly.

"好吧，抱歉拖你后腿了，" 明日香突然变得傲慢起来。

Shinji was rather taken aback by this and replied, "I didn't mean it like that."

真嗣对此感到相当意外，回答说："我不是那个意思。"

"Whatever," grumbled Asuka as she turned away from him, her face creased in anger.

“随它去吧，”明日香咕哝着，转身背对他，脸上满是怒容。

'Why the hell did I get this-'

“我他妈怎么就摊上这事儿了——”

Shinji paused, as he had been thinking something rather rude, though albeit true.

真嗣顿了顿，他刚才想到了些相当粗鲁但确实属实的话。

Standing up, he ignored her past comments and said, "Either way, I don't think we will be able to continue like this."

他站起身，无视她之前的评论，说道：“无论如何，我认为我们不能再这样下去了。”

Asuka shot him a look of pure malice, but Shinji didn't notice. If he thought she would allow him to touch her in any way-

明日香向他投去一记纯粹的恶意目光，但真嗣并未察觉。如果他认为她会允许他以任何方式触碰她——

"I'm sure you're hungry as well," said Shinji finishing his thought. "I mean, I don't know when the last time either of us have eaten, but I know food is more important right now than arguing."

“我敢肯定你也饿了，”真嗣说完他的想法，“我是说，我不知道我们上次吃饭是什么时候，但我知道现在食物比争吵更重要。”

Asuka caught back the words she had been about to throw at him. She had thought that he had about to suggest he carry her into the city, to find a better location or something. Though she didn't want to admit it, she was feeling awfully hungry.

明日香收回即将脱口而出的话语。她原以为他会提议背她进城，找个更好的地方或什么的。虽然她不想承认，但她确实感到非常饿。

"So you'll be going into the city again?" she asked.

“所以你要再次进城吗？”她问道。

"Yeah, in a bit," replied Shinji as he grabbed one of the remaining water bottles and sipped it slowly. "The water wont last much longer either."

“嗯，过会儿再说，” 真嗣回答着，拿起剩下的水瓶慢慢喝了一口。“水也撑不了多久了。”

Asuka frowned at his almost earnestness to leave. Did he want to get away from her that badly?

明日香皱眉看着他几乎急切地想要离开的样子。他真的那么想逃离她吗？

"The weather looks like it'll be worse today, so keep the fire going with the remaining sticks."

"今天天气看起来会更糟，所以用剩下的树枝继续保持火堆燃烧。"

"And if it goes out while your gone?"

"如果我不在的时候火熄灭了呢？"

"Stay warm under the sleeping bag?" Shinji suggested.

"躲在睡袋里保暖？" 真嗣建议道。"

"What a plan," said Asuka as she rolled her eyes.

"真是计划周详啊，" 明日香翻了个白眼说道。

"If you don't wanna contribute, then don't," said Shinji, finally getting fed up with Asuka's attitude.

"如果你不想帮忙，那就别帮，" 真嗣终于受够了明日香的态度，说道。

"And if you think I'm slowing you down, just leave then!" Asuka fired back.

"如果你觉得我拖你后腿，那就直接走人吧！" 明日香回敬道。

'You stupid girl,' thought Shinji angrily.

“你这个笨女孩，”真嗣气愤地想。

"Do what you want then," said Shinji as he started walking away from her.

“随你便吧，”真嗣说着，开始从她身边走开。

Asuka watched him until he was out of earshot before she mumbled, "Asshole."

明日香一直看着他直到听不见声音，才低声骂道：“混蛋。”

Climbing the top of the hill, Shinji briefly looked back at Asuka and saw that she was staring into the depths of the roaring fire. He really couldn't understand why she was being so stuck up. It was like there was a insurmountable wall that she had placed over herself that he couldn't see the top of. But if she was going to be like that...

攀至山顶，真嗣回头瞥了一眼明日香，只见她正凝视着熊熊烈火深处。他实在无法理解她为何如此高傲。仿佛她给自己筑起了一堵看不见顶的高墙。但如果她执意如此...

'Maybe it would be better to just leave her,' Shinji thought for a moment. But could he honestly just leave her to fend for herself? He didn't think so, even if she was being abrasive.

“或许直接离开她会更好，”真嗣思索片刻。但他能真的就这样让她自生自灭吗？他不这么认为，即便她态度尖锐。

Passing by the lonely cars, he started walking further into the city, thinking where he should look for food. By now, he had a walked this part of the city enough to recognize buildings that he had passed before and even had something like a map tucked away in his mind. He knew which buildings he had already searched, which didn't have anything useful, and which seemed completely unhelpful. But each time he entered the city, he kept on pushing further in a little more each time. However, it was only a matter of time until he exhausted what the city had to offer. Things were more dire than he cared to elaborate on.

经过那些孤零零的汽车，他继续向城市深处走去，思考着该去哪里寻找食物。如今，他对这片城区已足够熟悉，能认出之前经过的建筑，甚至脑海中隐约形成了一张地图。他知道哪些建筑已经搜寻过，哪些没有有用的东西，哪些看起来完全无用。但每次进入城市，他都会再深入一点。然而，城市能提供的资源终将耗尽，情况比他愿意细想的还要严峻。

The one thing he hadn't found yet was a supermarket, and that was what he was planning on searching for now.

他至今未找到的，是一家超市，而这正是他现在打算寻找的目标。

Passing the sporting goods store he had found on his first trip into the city, he ventured further into the city. As he went deeper in though, he noticed that the skyscrapers and buildings were different here, in that they seemed to have been destroyed by external reasons. Shinji was puzzled by this as he looked at one tower. The side of it looked almost as though a hand had scooped a large portion of the metal away.

经过他第一次进城时发现的体育用品店，他继续深入城市。然而，随着他越走越远，他注意到这里的摩天大楼和建筑物有所不同，它们似乎因外部原因而被破坏。真嗣看着一座塔楼，感到困惑。塔楼的一侧看起来就像是被一只手挖走了一大块金属。

Passing by this building, he walked down a side street that was littered with small, secondhand shops. Shinji didn't know what he had stumbled upon, but it seemed to be a rougher part of Tokyo-3 then he had ever seen before.

经过这座建筑，他走进了一条满是小二手店的侧街。真嗣不知道自己闯入了什么地方，但这似乎是他从未见过的东京-3 的更为粗犷的区域。

Exiting this side street, he walked out onto a main street, passing by the empty cars as he did. What looked like a convenience store/gas station loomed into his view, and for a moment he was exited. But then he saw the large hole at the front of the store and knew he wasn't getting past that.

离开这条小巷，他走到了一条主干道上，经过那些空无一人的汽车。一家看似便利店兼加油站的建筑映入眼帘，他一时感到兴奋。但随即他看到了店铺前的大洞，知道自己是无法通过那里的。

Walking down the street aways, he spent a few minutes trying to get into a store that seemed promising before he gave up. The front door seemed to have been barred from the inside, and he didn't have anything to break the glass.

沿着街道走了一段，他花了好几分钟试图进入一家看似有希望的店铺，但最终还是放弃了。前门似乎从内部被封死了，而他也没有任何工具可以打破玻璃。

He was starting to wonder if he shouldn't just back track so he didn't get lost though when he spotted a buildings off in the distance, or at least a sign. He stared at it for several seconds before he started walking in its direction. Several other buildings eclipsed its view until he rounded a corner that opened up into a small parking lot.

他开始怀疑自己是否应该原路返回，以免迷路，就在这时，他注意到远处有一座建筑，或者说至少是一个标志。他盯着它看了好几秒，然后开始朝那个方向走去。其他几座建筑遮挡了视线，直到他转过一个拐角，眼前豁然开朗，出现了一个小停车场。

Shinji stood in the empty parking lot for several seconds, before he started making his way to the store at the other end. It wasn't a grocery store per se, more like a store that seemed to sell everything. Whats more, it seemed to be in decent condition. It wasn't large by any means like those large supermarkets you sometimes see at malls, but it would hopefully meet his needs. At least, Shinji hoped this.

真嗣在空荡荡的停车场站了几秒钟，然后才开始向另一端的店铺走去。那并非一家严格意义上的杂货店，更像是一家似乎什么都有卖的店铺。更重要的是，它看起来状况还不错。虽然它绝不像你在商场里偶尔见到的那种大型超市那样大，但希望它能满足他的需求。至少，真嗣是这么希望的。

Walking up to the door, Shinji wasn't at all surprised that it didn't open. The electricity was gone, as it was with every other store in the area. But he wasn't going to accept this. Looking around the parking lot, he spotted some empty shopping carts and hoped this would do the trick. Grabbing one, he ran it right into the door with everything he had, making a long crack appear in the glass. Running at it again, the glass broke in several places this time, and Shinji was able to kick the rest of the glass away and force himself into the store.

走到门前，真嗣一点也不惊讶它没有打开。电力已经中断，就像这一带的其他商店一样。但他并不打算就此罢休。环顾停车场，他发现了一些空购物车，希望这能派上用场。他抓起一辆，使尽全力朝门撞去，玻璃上顿时出现了一道长长的裂痕。再次冲撞，这次玻璃在多处破裂，真嗣得以踢开剩余的碎玻璃，强行进入了商店。

As he stood up, he looked up at the wide ceiling above him, his mouth opened slightly in a gasp. As he walked past the cash registers the lined the front of the store, he stared down the isles at the amount of goods on the shelves. Admittedly, the majority of them didn't seem to be able to help them in anyways. Furniture, toys, kitchen supplies, light fixtures, and garden supplies took up a large portion of the store. Things which Shinji would never need...unless he was building a house, but he didn't see that happening anytime soon.

他站起身，抬头望向宽阔的天花板，嘴巴微微张开，发出一声惊叹。当他走过沿店铺前排列的收银机时，他沿着过道凝视着货架上琳琅满目的商品。诚然，其中大部分似乎都无法对他们有任何帮助。家具、玩具、厨房用品、灯具和园艺用品占据了商店的大部分空间。这些是真嗣永远不需要的东西……除非他在建房子，但他不认为这会很快发生。

As he walked further into the store though, he crinkled his nose as he smelled something foul. It wasn't quite as bad as the rat which he had smelled two days before, but it still made his nostrils flare. As he inched closer towards the smell, he realized what it was. A small sectioned of area of the store appeared to have stocked produce at one point. Now though, without the electricity to keep it cold, it had started rotting rather quickly. Shinji was just thankful that the place didn't seem to stock meat.

然而，当他继续深入商店时，他皱起了鼻子，闻到了一股恶臭。虽然没有两天前闻到的老鼠味那么糟糕，但仍让他鼻孔扩张。随着他慢慢接近那股气味，他意识到那是什么。商店的一小块区域似乎曾经存放过农产品。但现在，由于没有电力保持低温，它已经开始迅速腐烂。真嗣只是庆幸这个地方似乎没有存放肉类。

Walking past the produce he walked down several isles, none of which had anything that he would deem useful, unless he got desperate enough to eat dog food.

他走过农产品区，又穿过了几条过道，没有一样东西是他认为有用的，除非他真的到了不得不吃狗粮的地步。

'This place has produce, but nothing else? Does that even make sense,' he thought. It didn't seem like the place had been picked clean either.

“这个地方有农产品，但其他什么都没有？这合理吗？”他心想。看起来这里也不像是被洗劫一空的样子。

"Was it pointless to even come in here?" asked Shinji to the empty store.

“进来这里还有意义吗？”真嗣对着空荡荡的店铺问道。

As he started walking back towards the entrance of the store though, he spotted something which he was surprised he had missed. Afterall, beside cash registers, there was almost always candy for kids to beg to there parents for.

然而，当他开始走回商店入口时，他注意到一些他之前竟然没发现的东西。毕竟，在收银台旁边，通常总是有糖果供孩子们向父母央求。

Jogging up to cash register he paused and bent over, looking at what he had missed when he had come in.

他小跑向收银台，停下脚步弯腰查看，这才注意到自己刚进来时错过的东西。

Not just candy bars, but several bags of chips lined the sides of the cash registers. Shinji felt his stomach rumbling suddenly, realizing just how hungry he was then. He thought briefly of Asuka then, knowing that no matter how grouchy she was, she couldn't possibly deny food.

不仅仅是糖果棒，还有几袋薯片沿着收银台的两侧排列。真嗣突然感到肚子咕咕叫，意识到自己有多饿。他短暂地想起了明日香，知道无论她有多暴躁，她也不可能拒绝食物。

Grabbing as many candy bars as he could and stuffing them in his pocket, he grabbed two bags of chips each. It would have been nice to find a backpack now to carry everything, but he couldn't complain now he supposed that they had food.

他尽可能多地抓起糖果棒，塞进口袋，又各拿了两大袋薯片。如果能找到一个背包来装所有东西就好了，但他现在不能抱怨，毕竟他们有食物了。

Just as he was about to leave though, he grabbed two more bottles of water that had been in a small refrigerator beside the candy. Stuffing the two bottles in his back pocket, he slowly made his way out of the store.

正当他准备离开时，他抓起了两瓶放在糖果旁边小冰箱里的水。把两瓶水塞进后口袋，他慢慢走出了商店。

As Shinji made his way back down the hill leading to the beach, he saw Asuka curled up in the sleep bag. Thinking that she was sleeping, he walked slower as he neared her, but as she started moving restlessly, forbore all pretenses that he cared whether she was awake or not.

当真嗣沿着通往海滩的小山坡返回时，他看到明日香蜷缩在睡袋里。以为她还在睡觉，他放慢了脚步靠近她，但当她开始不安地动来动去时，他不再掩饰自己是否在意她是否醒着。

Sitting down across the fire from her, he started unloading his pockets just as Asuka slowly sat up and turned towards him. Shinji noticed this, but was still silent, remembering there argument from earlier. Asuka however was the first to speak, mainly because she noticed that Shinji had indeed come back with food.

他坐在火堆对面，开始从口袋里掏东西，与此同时，明日香缓缓坐起身转向他。真嗣注意到了，但依旧沉默不语，回想起他们之前的争吵。然而，明日香率先开口，主要是因为她注意到真嗣确实带回了食物。

"Back already?" “这么快就回来了？”

"You say that like you didn't think I would be back," replied Shinji bluntly.

“你这话说的，好像没想到我会回来似的。”真嗣直截了当地回答。

Asuka narrowed her eyes but didn't say anything.

明日香眯起眼睛，但没有说话。

"Here," said Shinji as he passed her a bag of chips and two candy bars.

"给，" 真嗣说着递给她一袋薯片和两根巧克力棒。

Asuka looked down at them and grimaced.

明日香低头看着它们，皱起了眉头。

"Is this it?" "就这些吗？"

"Sorry I wasn't able to cook you a three course meal. If you don't like it, then don't eat it."

“抱歉没能给你做一顿三道菜的大餐。你要是不喜欢，那就别吃了。”

Asuka mumbled the word asshole under her breath, but didn't say anything. Instead, she silently popped open her bag of chips and silently ate the meager meal. Shinji did likewise, and the two of them lapsed into silence.

明日香低声咕哝了一句“混蛋”，但没有说出口。她默默地打开薯片袋，默默地吃着这顿简陋的晚餐。真嗣也照做了，两人就这样陷入了沉默。

Though Shinji kept thinking.

尽管真嗣一直在思考。

If this was what they were expected to live off of, then was the entire thing hopeless after all? Asuka didn't seem pleased no matter what Shinji brought back, and this only made him feel more miserable. At first, he had been happy that he had someone else to talk to, but Asuka was such an unsociable person, that talking to her was like trying to reason with a rabid dog. They bit you no matter what you did.

如果这就是他们指望赖以生存的东西，那么整件事终究还是无望的吗？无论真嗣带回什么，明日香似乎都不满意，这让他感到更加痛苦。起初，他曾因有人可以交谈而感到高兴，但明日香是个如此不合群的人，与她交谈就像试图与一条狂犬讲道理。无论你做什么，它们都会咬你。

Finishing his own bag of chips and candy bar, he threw the wrapper to the side. If it was the end of civilization, then did it really matter if he littered or not.

吃完自己的那袋薯片和巧克力棒后，他将包装纸随手一扔。如果文明已经走到尽头，那么他是否乱扔垃圾又有什么关系呢。

Asuka seemed to have finished as well, though she threw her wrapper into the fire instead, almost in stark contrast to what Shinji had done. Turning away from him, she wrapped the sleeping bag around herself and blatantly ignored him.

明日香似乎也吃完了，但她将包装纸扔进了火里，与真嗣的做法形成鲜明对比。她转身背对他，裹紧睡袋，公然无视他的存在。

Shinji sat in silence for a while, staring into the fire, though not really seeing it. He was peering through, staring at Asuka's back. If they were indeed the only two people left in the city, or even the world for that matter (though he didn't want to admit that) then weren't they almost forced to work together...to live together. Or did she hate him so much that she would rather die than cooperate? Shinji didn't know, but as things were, they would sooner kill each other than work together.

真嗣沉默地坐了一会儿，凝视着火光，却并未真正看它。他的目光穿透火焰，凝视着明日香的背影。如果他们真的是这座城市，甚至可能是这个世界上仅存的两个人（尽管他不愿承认这一点），那么他们不是几乎被迫要合作...共同生活吗？还是说她恨他到宁愿死也不愿合作？真嗣不知道，但就目前的情况来看，他们宁愿互相残杀也不愿合作。

Against his will, he stood up from where he was sitting, and walked around to Asuka's side. Asuka almost immediately sensed movement, and the covers of the sleeping bag came off in a whirl. Shinji was surprised by this sudden turn in hostility, and even more surprised by what was grasped in Asuka's hand. One of the large sticks that had been used for kindling was grasped in Asuka's hand. Its tip was slightly pointed, and Shinji could only guess how she had gotten it that way.

违背他的意愿，他从坐的地方站了起来，绕到明日香那边。明日香几乎立刻察觉到了动静，睡袋的覆盖物瞬间被掀开。真嗣对这突如其来的敌意转变感到惊讶，更惊讶的是明日香手中握着的东西。一根用于引火的大木棍被明日香握在手中。它的尖端略微尖锐，真嗣只能猜测她是如何弄成这样的。

They both froze in there respective places, both eying each other evenly, waiting for someone to make a move. Shinji didn't have confidence in his own abilities really though, and knew that if things came to blows, he would be the one hurting instead.

他们各自僵在原地，目光平等地对视着，等待着有人采取行动。真嗣对自己的能力并没有太多信心，他知道如果事情发展到动手的地步，受伤的只会是他自己。

Taking several steps back he watched Asuka's eyes follow him slowly, those ocean blue eyes of hers filled with malice. Why was she so unable to trust him?

他后退了几步，观察着明日香的眼睛慢慢跟随他，她那湛蓝如海的眼睛充满了恶意。为什么她就是无法信任他呢？

"Hey...listen-" but Asuka cut him off rudely.

“嘿...听着——”但明日香粗鲁地打断了他。

"I won't hesitate to use this if I have to!"

“如果必要的话，我绝不会犹豫使用这个！”

Shinji knew that she wasn't lying, and didn't want to give her any reason to stab him with it.

真嗣知道她没有撒谎，也不想给她任何理由用它刺伤自己。

"Will you just listen to-"

"你能不能就听我说——"

"You don't have anything to say to me that I care to hear!"

"你没有什么话是我愿意听的！"

"Why are you being like this?"

"你为什么这样对我？"

Asuka clammed up, and seemed unwilling to talk, but Shinji wasn't going to accept this.

明日香闭口不言，显得不愿多谈，但真嗣并不打算就此罢休。

"You don't like me, I don't like you. Okay...fine...whatever. And I know your legs still don't work and I understand that you're frustrated about that."

你不喜欢我，我也不喜欢你。好吧...行吧...随便。而且我知道你的腿还是动不了，我理解你为此感到沮丧。

"How the fuck would you know how I feel!? How the fuck would you understand me!? You don't know anything about me!" yelled Asuka.

"你怎么可能知道我的感受！？你怎么可能理解我！？你对我一无所知！" 明日香吼道。

"I know that you're being stubborn and unreasonable!" Shinji fired back. "But we don't know anything about each other than our fucking names!"

"我知道你在固执和不讲理！" 真嗣反驳道。"但我们除了彼此的名字之外，对对方一无所知！"

"And thats the way it'll stay!"

"那就这样保持下去吧！"

Shinji was so furious at her that he suddenly rose to his feet, which made Asuka tighten her grip on the stick she held. But Shinji's next move surprised her slightly.

"Fine. You want to be like this? Fine! You can die of starvation on this beach for all I care."

"好吧。你想这样是吧？好！你就在这海滩上饿死吧，我才不在乎呢。"

Shinji stormed over to his side of the fire and gathered up the remaining food, the water bottles, and the lighter, and started marching up the side of the hill.

真嗣气冲冲地走到火堆的另一边，收拾起剩下的食物、水瓶和打火机，开始向山坡上走去。

"I'd rather starve than be stuck interacting with a piece of shit like you!" Asuka called back at him. "I hope something falls on you and crushes your lower body."

"我宁愿饿死也不愿和你这种人渣打交道！" 明日香回敬道，"希望有什么东西掉下来砸烂你的下半身。"

"So then I'll understand what you feel like!?"

"这样我就明白你的感受了！？"

"Yeah!" “耶！”

Shinji glared at her with such anger in his eyes that he could feel his entire body shaking. And what else was there? Something else inside him felt like it had snapped. He suddenly wanted to choke the life out of this bitch!

真嗣瞪着她，眼中怒火中烧，以至于他感到全身都在颤抖。除此之外还有什么？他内心深处似乎有什么东西断裂了。他突然想掐死这个婊子！

'I'm not wasting another moment around her!'

"“‘我再也不想在她身边浪费哪怕一刻了！’”

Marching away from the fire, he walked up the slope leading into the city and paused briefly as he reached the top. He looked back down the hill to where Asuka was. She was staring blankly into the fire.

他离开火堆，走上通往城市的斜坡，到达顶端时短暂地停了下来。他回头望向山下，那里是明日香所在的地方。她正茫然地凝视着火光。

'If she thinks she's better off on her own, then I won't waste anymore time on her.'

'如果她认为自己一个人会更好，那我就不再在她身上浪费时间了。'

With that thought, Shinji walked into the city.

带着这样的想法，真嗣走进了城市。

Shinji had little to no trouble navigating his way through the streets that he had become rather accustomed to. Noon had passed and afternoon was starting to set into evening when Shinji decided to take a break. He had been walking for most of the time since he had left the beach, but didn't have any goal in mind. In fact, his mind was entirely blank for the most part. He had walked back to the store he had visited that morning and had grabbed several more bags of chips, but in his daze, had quickly eaten them.

真嗣在熟悉的小巷中穿梭自如，几乎没遇到什么困难。中午已过，午后渐入黄昏，真嗣决定稍作休息。自离开海滩以来，他大部分时间都在行走，却并无明确目标。事实上，他的思绪大部分时间都是一片空白。他走回了早上光顾的那家店，又抓了几袋薯片，但在恍惚中很快就吃完了。

He didn't want to think about it, but his mind always wandered to her. He couldn't help but wonder about her. Surely, if her leg didn't heal in two days, it was very probable that she could die. He tried to push this thought away, put he kept on thinking it would be his fault if she died. On the other hand though, she didn't want him around, loathed him so much that she would rather die alone than together. There was something fundamentally wrong with that logic.

他不想去想，但思绪总是不由自主地飘向她。他忍不住去想她。如果她的腿两天内没有痊愈，她很可能会死去。他试图驱散这个念头，但又不断想着，如果她死了，那将是他的错。另一方面，她并不希望他在身边，她如此厌恶他，以至于宁愿独自死去也不愿与他共度。这种逻辑从根本上就是错误的。

Sitting on the side of the street against a curb, he rested his head in his hands as he stared ahead of him. This side of the city seemed to be heavily destroyed by things that didn't even seem like human weapons. The buildings had large gouges almost scraped out of them.

他坐在街边，背靠路缘石，双手托着头，目光呆滞地望向前方。这座城市的这一侧似乎被一些不像是人类武器的东西严重破坏了。建筑物上有着几乎被刮掉的大块痕迹。

What had happened here in Tokyo-3? The end of the world? Well, something seemed to have caused that ending. And why was it that Shinji's memory was so spotty in this aspect. It was like he had woken up on another planet. Was Asuka's memory missing pieces as Shinji's was, or did she remember everything that had transpired? If she did, then maybe that would explain her attitude. She could even have had something to do with it...maybe...

东京-3 究竟发生了什么？是世界末日吗？嗯，似乎有什么导致了这场终结。为什么真嗣在这方面的记忆如此模糊？感觉就像是在另一个星球上醒来一样。明日香的记忆是否也像真嗣那样缺失了部分，还是她记得所有发生的事情？如果她记得，那么这或许能解释她的态度。她甚至可能与此事有关……也许……

But that didn't make much sense, considering she seemed just as old as Shinji.

但考虑到她看起来和真嗣一样大，这似乎不太合理。

'I shouldn't be thinking of those things, especially if I plan on not returning.'

'我不该去想那些事，尤其是如果我打算不回去的话。'

But could Shinji live with himself if he didn't return? Could he live with her death on his hands. Even so, what if she was the only person alive besides him? What then?

但如果真嗣不回去，他能原谅自己吗？他能承受她死在自己手上的事实吗？即便如此，如果她是除了他之外唯一活着的人呢？那又该如何是好？

'She made her own decision, and I made mine,' thought Shinji.

“她做出了自己的决定，我也做出了我的。” 真嗣心想。

Standing up, he started walking deeper in the destroyed city.

他站起身，开始向这座废墟城市的更深处走去。

At the same time Shinji was taking his break, Asuka was having problems of her own. She didn't know how many hours had gone by since Shinji had left, but the fire had died significantly since then. She had slowly added the remaining sticks and small logs to the fire in increments, but that didn't change the fact that the fire was dying, and that she didn't have anymore kindling. Whats more, she had half a bottle of water left. Though she supposed, if worse came to worse, she could drink LCL fluid. Getting there was an entirely different problem though.

与此同时，真嗣正在休息，而明日香则面临着她自己的问题。她不知道自真嗣离开后已经过去了多少小时，但火势自那时起已大大减弱。她慢慢地将剩余的树枝和小木头分批加入火中，但这并未改变火势正在熄灭的事实，而且她也没有更多的引火物了。更糟糕的是，她只剩下半瓶水。尽管她想，如果情况恶化，她可以喝 LCL 液体。但到达那里完全是另一个问题。

Just as Shinji was thinking the same thing, the thought crossed Asuka's mind that if her legs didn't heal in two days, then she would be in serious trouble if she was left by herself. The amount of energy and exertion that was put into dragging her body across the sand was more than she had expected, and she could respect handicapped people more now. Her energy seemed to drain out of her body quickly, and it didn't help that the food had only made her more hungry.

就在真嗣思考同样的事情时，明日香也想到，如果她的腿两天内没有痊愈，那么如果她独自一人，将会陷入严重的困境。拖着身体穿越沙地所消耗的能量和努力超出了她的预期，现在她更加尊重残疾人了。她的精力似乎迅速从体内流失，而且食物只让她更饿了，这无济于事。

As the fire continued dying until almost only embers remained though, she had to make a decision. Pulling herself out of the comfort of her sleeping bag, she pushed herself upward so that she was in a sitting position. The nearest pieces of drift wood couldn't have been further than twenty feet, but that seemed almost like a mile to her. Steeling herself for the journey, she made several hesitating moves until she forced herself forward, clawing at the sand.

随着火焰持续减弱，几乎只剩下余烬时，她不得不做出决定。她从舒适的睡袋中挣扎出来，用力撑起身体，坐了起来。最近的浮木碎片距离不超过二十英尺，但对她来说却仿佛相隔一英里。她鼓起勇气准备出发，犹豫了几下后，终于强迫自己向前，用双手扒拉着沙子。

No matter how it had happened, Asuka was glad that Shinji wasn't around to see her pitiful state. It was beneath her to be crawling on her stomach like the whore of a pimp. She was a fucking Evangelion pilot after all! The only thing that she was remotely thankful, was that the plug suit was elastic, so that it seemed to repel the sand away from it.

无论这一切是如何发生的，明日香庆幸真嗣不在身边看到她这副可怜的样子。像妓女一样趴在地上，这实在有失她的身份。毕竟，她可是个该死的 EVA 驾驶员！唯一让她略感庆幸的是，插入栓服弹性十足，似乎能将沙子拒之门外。

Her legs were as heavy as lead, but still, she dragged herself forward. After a few minutes of this, her hand clasped the rotted wood and she turned around, and threw it over to the fire. She would need several more of that size if she hoped to keep the fire going. Turning back to the scattered wood, she felt her resolve falter a bit. She couldn't remember the last time she had felt this miserable...not since her days in Germany probably. But she was alive at least, which is more than you could say for her mind during her days with-

她的双腿沉重如铅，但她仍拖着身子向前挪动。几分钟后，她的手抓住了腐朽的木头，转身将其抛入火中。如果希望火继续燃烧，她还需要更多这样的木头。转回散落的木头堆，她感到决心有些动摇。她记不清上一次感到如此悲惨是什么时候了...大概是在德国的日子吧。但至少她还活着，这比她在那段日子里的心境要好得多——

'Don't think about that place,' thought Asuka bitterly. 'I'm passed all that now. I'm my own person.'

'别想那个地方了，'明日香苦涩地想，'那些都过去了。我现在是我自己。'

The pain and the memories would remain though.

痛苦和记忆仍将留存。

Asuka spent several more minutes dragging herself to pieces of dry wood and then flinging them over her head until she decided that enough was enough. Slowly, she started dragging herself back towards the fire pit. By now, her entire body was coated in sweat that was seeping into her eyes.

明日香又花了好几分钟，拖着身子捡拾干木块，然后用力抛向头顶，直到她觉得够了为止。慢慢地，她开始拖着自己返回篝火旁。此时，她全身已被汗水浸透，汗水渗进了眼睛。

The struggle back was even more difficult, and seemed to take even longer. Even though she wasn't cold right now, she knew that if the fire went out, she'd be in trouble. Shinji had taken the lighter with him, and though she was confident she could make a fire without a lighter, her legs wouldn't allow it.

返回的路更加艰难，似乎也更加漫长。尽管现在她并不觉得冷，但她知道如果火熄灭了，她就会有麻烦。真嗣带走了打火机，虽然她自信不用打火机也能生火，但她的双腿却不允许她这么做。

Stacking several of the smaller logs on the fire, she slowly built it up again until it was burning peacefully again.

她将几根较小的木柴堆叠在火上，缓缓地重新点燃，直到火焰再次平静地燃烧起来。

Finished with her work, she rolled over onto her back and rested on the sleeping bag with a hand covering her forehead. Her hair laid splayed out on the cold sand, but she didn't care about that right now. If she could just rest her eyes for a few seconds, then the pain and hurt would hopefully go away...

工作结束后，她翻身仰躺，手搭在额头上，靠在睡袋上休息。头发散落在冰冷的沙地上，但她此刻并不在意。如果只是闭眼小憩片刻，或许疼痛和伤感就会随之消散……

Right? 对吧？

Night had finally descended on Tokyo-3, and still Shinji hadn't found a place to sleep for the night. Pavement wasn't exactly the most comfortable, and for some reason he didn't want to sleep in a car. Even the sand at the beach would feel better than what asphalt could offer him.

夜幕终于降临了东京-3，而真嗣仍未找到过夜的地方。路面绝非舒适的选项，出于某种原因，他也不愿睡在车里。哪怕是沙滩上的沙子，也比沥青地面要舒适得多。

As he thought this, he turned around and stared off towards the beach he had come from. He didn't know how many miles he had walked, or how long it had been, but he had looked behind him at one point and was able to see a thin cloud of smoke lifting into the air as the sun shown through it. At least she was able to keep warm.

正当他思索着这些，他转过身，凝视着来时的海滩。他不清楚自己走了多少英里，也不知已过了多久，但曾有一刻他回头望去，看见一缕轻烟袅袅升空，阳光穿透其间。至少她能取暖了。

Shinji had abandoned thinking of her by her named and simply denoted her as "she." It made things a little easier not having to associate her with anyone he knew. She was simply a stepping stone down whatever path he had started walking on.

真嗣已经不再用她的名字来称呼她，只是简单地称她为“她”。这样让事情变得稍微轻松一些，不必将她与自己认识的任何人联系起来。她不过是他在开始行走的某条路上的一块垫脚石。

'Though the path doesn't seem to be leading me anywhere specific,' thought Shinji as he looked around him.

"'虽然这条路似乎并没有带我到任何特定的地方，' 真嗣环顾四周，心中暗想。

And he couldn't have been more specific.

而他对此再清楚不过了。

Though he didn't know it, he was standing on ground that his feet had once treaded in a not so distant, but forgotten memory. The ground around him looked as though it had been bulldozed into oblivion, and the buildings around were little more than rubble. The bombing and shelling had been the worst in this area, but that wasn't the half of it. If she had come with him, she could have taken one look at the rubble, and guessed what had probably happened. But since Shinji didn't have anything to do with Nerv, he wouldn't have a clue.

尽管他并不知情，他正站在一片曾经踏足的土地上，那是一段不久前却已被遗忘的记忆。四周的土地仿佛被推土机夷为平地，建筑物只剩下残垣断壁。这片区域遭受的轰炸和炮击最为严重，但这还只是冰山一角。如果她与他同行，只需一眼望向废墟，便能猜到可能发生了什么。但既然真嗣与 NERV 无关，他对此一无所知。

Be that as it may, his current path was taking him towards the hills above Tokyo-3, and though they were still far off, Shinji was starting to see them clearer every few feet or so. He was remarkably surprised at how well he was able to see in the dark, and still surprised that he had hardly gotten tired during this journey. His stamina didn't seem like it had once...or maybe he had just never applied himself properly.

尽管如此，他现在的路线正引领他前往东京-3 上方的山丘，虽然还相距甚远，但每走几步，真嗣就能更清晰地看到它们。他对自己在黑暗中能看得如此清楚感到非常惊讶，同时也惊讶于自己在这次旅程中几乎没有感到疲惫。他的耐力似乎不再像从前那样……或者也许他从未真正发挥过自己的潜力。

Pushing onwards, Shinji was starting to think that he may be able to reach the hills before night ended. His water supply wasn't bad, and he still had several bags of chips left. Only problem was when he got to the hills. What then?

继续前行，真嗣开始觉得他或许能在夜晚结束前到达山丘。他的水供应还不错，还剩下几袋薯片。唯一的问题是到达山丘后该怎么办？

He didn't know, but anything would be better than plodding around the city all night and day.

他不知道，但任何事情都比整日整夜在城市里徘徊要好。

Making up his mind, he started walking at a brisker pace, and told himself that he would reach the hills before sun up. That was around the time when she woke from her slumber, her scream echoing in the night.

下定决心后，他加快了步伐，暗自决定要在日出前抵达山丘。那时正是她从睡梦中惊醒，尖叫声划破夜空的时刻。

Whether Shinji heard it or not, he didn't give any motion of turning back.

无论真嗣是否听见了，他都没有表现出任何转身回来的迹象。

Asuka's scream wasn't unbidden, nor was it like her to show such fear so suddenly.

明日香的尖叫并非无缘无故，她也不是那种会突然表现出如此恐惧的人。

She awoke with a start, and was assaulted with such pain in her legs that her mouth opened up and a voice she hadn't heard since she was a kid escaped it. She was screaming in pain. Through the pain though, she remembered a vivid memory which may have been the thing that awoke her. She was back there, back were she never belonged, back in hell. The memory and the pain became too much, and all at once she felt tears streaking down her face. When was the last time she had cried? Years ago? Surely it wasn't in recent years, and she had hardened her resolve since then. But even that could be broken so easily if something stronger shook her.

她猛然惊醒，双腿传来的剧痛让她不由自主地张开嘴，发出自孩提时代以来未曾听过的声音。她在痛苦中尖叫。尽管如此，她记得一个生动的记忆，那可能是唤醒她的原因。她回到了那里，回到她本不该存在的地方，回到了地狱。记忆和痛苦变得难以承受，一瞬间，她感到泪水顺着脸颊流下。她上一次哭泣是什么时候？几年前吗？肯定不是近几年，自那以后她已经坚定了决心。但即便如此，如果有什么更强大的东西震撼了她，那决心也能轻易被打破。

Her legs felt inflamed, like thousands of hot embers had struck them simultaneously. It must have been the exertion from earlier. Her muscles were screaming in pain, and so was she.

她的双腿感觉像是被成千上万的热炭同时击中，火辣辣的。这一定是之前过度劳累的结果。她的肌肉在痛苦中尖叫，她自己也一样。

Asuka bit down on her lips, forcing herself not to be weak, to not let her voice out. If she could beat the pain, she would be fine. But showing weakness...that was unacceptable.

明日香紧咬着嘴唇，强迫自己不要示弱，不要发出声音。如果她能战胜疼痛，她就会没事。但表现出软弱……那是绝对不允许的。

Sitting up, she grabbed one of her legs, and slowly moved it, still bitting down on her lips as she did so. If she screamed, he might hear it, and he would come and-

她坐起身，抓住一条腿，慢慢地移动它，依旧紧咬着嘴唇。如果她尖叫，他可能会听到，然后他会过来——

'Stop it,' Asuka told herself. 'He left and he's not coming back!'

'别再想了，'明日香对自己说。'他走了，不会再回来了！'

Who was he though? Shinji, or-

他到底是谁？真嗣，还是——

"STOP IT!" Asuka screamed, not to her legs, but whatever had happened in her previous life.

“住脑！”明日香尖叫道，不是对着她的双腿，而是对着她前世发生的那些事。

Her chest heaving, her breath shallow, Asuka breathed in angrily, not even seeming to notice that the pain was slowly subsiding. But a new pain was slowly creeping in called reality. Reality of what she was facing, what would happen if her legs didn't get better. She wasn't even sure she could deal with dragging herself forward. The last bottle of water was gone, and there was no way she would be inching near the surf of Tokyo-3.

她的胸膛剧烈起伏，呼吸浅促，明日香愤怒地吸了口气，似乎并未察觉到疼痛正逐渐减轻。但一种新的痛苦正悄然袭来，名为现实。她所面对的现实，如果她的双腿无法好转，将会发生什么。她甚至不确定自己能否承受拖着身体前行的重负。最后一瓶水已经喝完，她绝不会向第三新东京市的浪涛靠近半步。

The pain had disappeared now, and she slowly lay herself back on the sleeping bag. She didn't even bother to check that the fire had died out completely. At that point, she didn't feel like doing anything different.

疼痛此刻已消失无踪，她缓缓躺回睡袋中。她甚至懒得检查火是否已完全熄灭。在那一刻，她觉得什么都不想做，一切如常。

Asuka had always been strong, stubborn, cold of heart, even sometimes ruthless. But not being in control was something she had never experienced in a long time. Having to rely on somebody else...she thought she would rather die than have that happen. Now though, that prospect wasn't looking too bad.

明日香一直坚强、固执、心冷如冰，甚至有时冷酷无情。但失去控制是她许久未曾体验的感觉。不得不依赖他人……她曾以为宁愿死也不愿如此。然而现在，这个前景似乎并不那么糟糕了。

Asuka slept fitfully that night, passing in and out of sleep and being occasionally awoken by her paining legs. Meanwhile, on the other side of the city, Shinji plodded on his useless walk, not realizing what was happening behind him.

那晚，明日香睡得断断续续，时而入睡时而惊醒，不时被疼痛的双腿所扰。与此同时，城市的另一端，真嗣漫无目的地走着，丝毫未察觉身后发生的一切。

True to his word, Shinji made it to the foothills of Tokyo-3 and just started climbing it when the tip of the sun climbed over the ocean. By the time it was reaching high point in the sky, he had climbed the top of one of the smaller hills and looked out across the city. He allowed himself two hours of sleep, and then was up again.

真嗣信守诺言，抵达了第三新东京市的山脚，当太阳从海平面升起时，他便开始攀登。到了正午时分，他已经登上了其中一座较小的山顶，俯瞰着整个城市。他允许自己小憩两小时，随后便再次起身。

Shinji had decided that this hike was largely to determine what he was dealing with, and get an idea of the state of the city. Though something was nagging at him in the back of his mind.

真嗣决定这次徒步主要是为了了解自己所面对的情况，以及城市的现状。尽管心中总有一丝不安萦绕不去。

All in all, he didn't learn much about the city that he could have guessed from just seeing when he had walked. Much of it was destroyed near the center, but near the beach it seemed more intact. He didn't see any lights coming from the buildings down bellow, so nothing had electricity. But that was a given. Though it may have registered, he didn't think about the lack of smoke coming from the beach.

总的来说，关于这座城市，他能从步行时所见猜测到的大部分信息，实际上并未通过这次探索获得更多。市中心附近损毁严重，但海滩附近似乎保存得较为完好。他没看到下方建筑中有灯光透出，意味着这里没有电力供应。不过这一点也不足为奇。尽管可能有所察觉，但他并未深思海滩上为何没有炊烟升起。

Sitting down in the grass, he popped open a bag of chips and slowly ate them. He had been more careful with them since he had decided to hike up the hill, but that didn't mean he had an infinite supply. He thought that his chance of finding fresh water may be better up here then in the city.

他坐在草地上，打开一袋薯片，慢慢地吃了起来。自从决定徒步上山后，他对这些零食就更加珍惜了，但这并不意味着他有无穷无尽的储备。他觉得在这山上找到淡水的可能性或许比在城市里要大些。

Looking out across the destroyed city, Shinji briefly wondered about his father. His father was something of an enigma to him; he never really understood him, and sometimes even hated him for shuffling him around most of his life. How many places had he lived before coming to Tokyo-3? Shinji didn't know, but guessed it was in the double digits.

眺望着被摧毁的城市，真嗣短暂地想起了他的父亲。父亲对他来说是个谜；他从未真正理解过他，有时甚至因为他将自己一生中的大部分时间都搬来搬去而恨他。在来到第三新东京市之前，他到底住过多少地方？真嗣不知道，但猜测应该是两位数。

Finishing his bag of chips, he threw the bag on the ground and stood up, stretching as he did. He wished he had something like a backpack right about now, but wishing wasn't doing him any good. Instead, he turned his attention to the many hills behind him, stretching out into the distance. Between here and there, he didn't see any sign of water, only a smattering of several houses along the country roads. Out here though, it didn't seem like much had been affected by whatever had destroyed Tokyo-3.

吃完薯片后，他将袋子扔在地上，站起身来伸了个懒腰。他现在真希望有个背包什么的，但光是希望对他没有任何帮助。于是，他将注意力转向身后连绵起伏的丘陵，一直延伸到远方。从这里到那里，他没看到任何水的迹象，只有几座散落在乡间小路上的房屋。不过在这里，似乎没有什么受到摧毁第三新东京市的那种力量的影响。

'I'll probably find more food and water in those houses,' thought Shinji.

“那些房子里可能会有更多的食物和水，”真嗣心想。

With this comforting thought, he started walking down the other side of the hill, while behind him, Tokyo-3 melted in the scenery.

带着这份慰藉，他开始沿着山坡的另一侧行走，而身后的第三新东京市则在景色中渐渐消融。

The pain and the weariness had kept Asuka awake during most of the night, and it was only when the sun rose, that she was finally able to sleep more comfortably. It seemed that her legs weren't paining her as long as she was warm, and it was probably the lack of fire that had spurred the pain.

疼痛和疲惫让明日香整夜难以入眠，直到太阳升起，她才终于能更舒适地入睡。似乎只要身体暖和，她的双腿就不那么痛了，可能正是因为缺乏火源才加剧了疼痛。

She was sitting up now and staring into the dead embers of the fire; her mind was a blank however. How much longer would she last? Another day? Two more? A week? What was the possibility of that even? No food, no water, how long could a human live like that?

此刻她坐起身来，凝视着火堆的余烬；然而她的思绪却一片空白。她还能坚持多久？再一天？两天？一周？这可能性又有多大呢？没有食物，没有水，人能这样活多久？

Asuka shook her head suddenly, trying to clear her thoughts. Thinking like that would only prove worse after all. Her legs weren't hurting right now, so while they were like this, it was best to make the most of the situation.

明日香突然摇了摇头，试图理清思绪。那样想只会让情况变得更糟。她的腿现在并不疼，所以趁现在这样，最好充分利用这个局面。

Still unable to stand up, Asuka swiveled around and grabbed one of the empty water bottles that was next to her. Struggling forward, Asuka crawled her way across the sand as she made her way towards the ocean. She couldn't live long without water, that much was true, and while her leg held out, she planned to make that reality true.

尽管仍无法站起来，明日香转过身，抓住旁边的一个空水瓶。她艰难地向前爬行，穿过沙滩，朝着大海前进。没有水她活不了多久，这是事实，只要她的腿还能撑住，她就打算让这个现实成真。

Again though, crawling across the ground like this brought back bitter memories of home. The filth, the vomit, that entire house had been a cage that she was kept in the first eight years of her life.

然而，像这样在地上爬行，又勾起了对家的痛苦回忆。那肮脏、呕吐物，整个房子在她生命的前八年里就像一个囚笼。

'And yet this is still somehow better,' laughed Asuka internally. This somewhat brought her spirits up slightly, and she continued moving forward at a faster pace.

'然而这不知怎的竟变得更好了，'明日香内心笑道。这多少让她精神振奋了些，她加快步伐继续前行。

As she neared the ocean, she could feel the spray hit her face as the wind whipped her hair around. Briefly, she rested and enjoyed the feel of the cool morning air as it struck her face, but she quickly returned to the matter at hand.

当她接近海洋时，可以感受到海风卷起的水花拍打在脸上，她的头发随风飘扬。她短暂地停下脚步，享受着清晨凉爽的空气拂面而来的感觉，但很快又回到了手头的事情上。

Reaching the surf, she laid down just as it swept under her, cooling her sweating back and face as the spray continued hitting her. She placed the back of her hand over her forehead and laughed clearly. She was laughing at whatever had placed her in this situation, laughing that she had defied her fears, laughing that she had beat him again.

到达浪花边，她顺势躺下，海浪正好在她身下冲刷而过，冷却了她汗流浃背的背部和脸庞，水花依旧不断打在她身上。她用手背遮住额头，清晰地笑出声来。她在笑那个将她置于如此境地的人，笑自己克服了恐惧，笑自己再次战胜了他。

"I'm still alive you bastard," said Asuka towards to sky.

“我还没死呢，你这个混蛋。”明日香对着天空说道。

She hadn't laughed at all since she had awoken in the bombed out shelter that was Tokyo-3, but it felt refreshing.

自从她在被炸毁的东京-3 避难所醒来后，她从未笑过，但此刻感觉神清气爽。

Regaining her composure, she turned the bottle that she had held in her hand down towards the LCL fluid and filled it slowly.

她恢复了镇定，将手中的瓶子转向 LCL 液体，缓缓地将其装满。

'I don't think I'll even be able to notice a difference in taste at this point,' thought Asuka as she watched the fluid fill to the rim of the bottle. She had been practicing to be an Eva pilot now for so long that she could drink this stuff like water.

“我想我现在甚至尝不出味道上的差别了，”明日香看着液体慢慢装满瓶口时心想。她已经练习成为 Eva 驾驶员这么久了，现在喝这东西就像喝水一样自然。

Filling the bottle to the top, she capped it and placed it beside her, enjoying this brief moment of rest. The sun beat down on her red hair, turning it a brilliant orange sheen. Basking in the warmth of the sun for a while, she finally decided that it was best for her to head back. Maybe she could even get a fire started at this rate. She was feeling fairly good right now after all. She even forgot that her legs weren't working and even tried standing up. She found that funny for some reason and smiled slightly.

将瓶子灌满后，她盖上盖子，将其放在身旁，享受这片刻的宁静。阳光洒在她红色的发丝上，映出耀眼的橙色光泽。沐浴在温暖的阳光中片刻，她最终决定还是返回为妙。或许她还能趁此机会生起火来。毕竟，此刻她感觉相当不错。她甚至忘记了双腿无法行走，还尝试着站起身来。不知为何，她觉得这颇为有趣，嘴角微微上扬。

Taking several drinks of water from the surf (it really didn't taste any different), she started slowly crawling her way back.

她从浪花中喝了好几口水（其实味道并没有什么不同），然后开始慢慢地爬回岸边。

All too quickly, a sharp pain seared through her legs and made her stop suddenly. She took several large gasps of air, trying to ignore the pain. It would subside if she just waited long enough. Asuka told herself this, but it didn't help to alleviate the pain. Whatever happened though, she couldn't let herself cry like she had last night.

转瞬间，一阵剧痛如火舌般席卷她的双腿，迫使她骤然停下。她大口喘息，试图忽视这痛楚。只要耐心等待，疼痛终会消退。明日香如此自我安慰，却未能减轻丝毫痛感。无论如何，她不能再像昨晚那样任由泪水滑落。

Fighting against the pain she continued moving forward, biting down on her lips until blood flew forth. This helped clear her mind slightly, but the pain was starting to blind her now. How was it that this had happened to her? Was it because of her decision to become an Evangelion pilot? Would she even still be alive if she wasn't one. What had happened to Tokyo-3?

她强忍着疼痛继续前行，咬紧嘴唇直至鲜血四溅。这稍稍让她清醒了一些，但疼痛正逐渐使她失明。这一切是如何发生在她身上的？是因为她决定成为 EVA 驾驶员吗？如果不是，她还会活着吗？第三新东京市又发生了什么？

It took Asuka much longer to get back to the makeshift camp, and we she finally did, she collapsed into a heap of weariness and despair.

阿斯卡了很久才回到临时营地，当她终于到达时，她疲惫不堪地瘫倒在地，充满了绝望。

Many miles away, Shinji was having second guesses about his decision. He had long ago reached the bottom of the valley, but the houses he had been in didn't hold anything significant. He was starting to regret his decision.

在数英里之外，真嗣对自己的决定产生了疑虑。他早已到达山谷底部，但那些房子里并没有什么重要的东西。他开始后悔自己的选择了。

The only upside was that the scenery was at least quite beautiful.

唯一的好处是，至少这里的风景相当美丽。

Shinji had never ventured over the hills before, which made sense, since he hadn't been in Tokyo-3 that long, but he could have imagined himself living here at one point. Even now, he found that idea to be quite pleasant.

真嗣以前从未翻越过这些山丘，这很合理，毕竟他在第三新东京市待的时间并不长，但他曾想象过自己在这里生活的情景。即便现在，他仍觉得这个想法相当美好。

Bring matters back to hand though, he had to think about what to do next.

不过，回到现实，他必须考虑接下来该做什么。

He was sitting on the porch of some forsaken house. He had already been through every room and hadn't found anything except some water in the fridge. He had hoped that the plumbing was still working, but the faucet had been bare. His food was gone now, and he was just starting to get hungry.

他坐在一栋被遗弃的房子的门廊上。他已经搜遍了每个房间，除了冰箱里的一些水，什么也没找到。他本以为水管还能用，但水龙头早已干涸。他的食物已经耗尽，饥饿感正开始袭来。

He had thought that since the houses here hadn't been touched by whatever had befallen Tokyo-3, that they should have plenty of supplies in them. He hadn't thought about the sparsity of these houses in the first place. It wasn't like any small town or anything. Since Tokyo-3 was just over the hill, most people would just drive over it and buy whatever they needed in the city. Out here in the countryside, people only lived here to escape the noise and smell of the city, and that was very few people. All in all, not even fifteen houses filled the green valley.

他原以为既然这里的房屋未受第三新东京市遭遇的任何灾难波及，那么屋内应该储备充足。他未曾考虑到这些房屋的稀少程度。这里并不像任何小镇之类的地方。由于第三新东京市就在山的那一边，大多数人会直接驱车前往城市购买所需物品。在这片乡间，人们居住于此只是为了逃离城市的喧嚣与气味，这样的人寥寥无几。总而言之，绿意盎然的谷地中，连十五栋房屋都填不满。

Shinji kicked his feet absently at the dirt ground bellow him, his legs swinging slightly as they dangled off the porch. What decision would be best now? He was at least two days out from the city, and maybe four from the beach, but going back now didn't seem like something he could bring upon himself. Hadn't he already given up on what was behind him?

真嗣无意识地踢着脚下的泥土，双腿悬在门廊外轻轻晃动。眼下该作何抉择？他离城市至少还有两天路程，或许去海边得四天，但此刻折返似乎并非自己所能承受。难道他不是已经放弃了身后的一切吗？

'Yet you still never met another person while walking here,' a voice told Shinji.

“然而你在这里散步时从未遇到过其他人，”一个声音告诉真嗣。

Maybe that had been another part of it. Deep in the back of his mind, he told himself that if he branched out further, there would be a better chance to find other people that may have survived. But there didn't seem to be anybody else within a fifty mile radius.

也许那只是其中一部分原因。在他内心深处，他告诉自己，如果他走得更远一些，找到其他幸存者的机会可能会更大。但似乎在五十英里的范围内并没有其他人。

'So what was the point of all this then?' he asked himself.

“那么这一切的意义又是什么呢？”他自问道。

'Weren't you just running away again? Isn't that all you ever do?'

'你刚才不是又在逃跑吗？你不就是一直在这么做吗？'

'She forced me into that.'

'是她逼我的。'

'You made the conscious decision to abandon her though.'

'但你还是做出了抛弃她的决定。'

'Like me being there would have made a difference.'

'就像我在那里会有什么不同一样。'

'It did though. Without you, she may have died earlier...she may be dead now though.'

'确实有区别。没有你，她可能早就死了...虽然现在她可能已经不在了。'

No, not that. That was the past. I can't think about things like that if I'm going to survive.

不，不是那个。那是过去的事了。如果我要活下去，就不能再想这些事。

"Survive? With what?" mumbled Shinji.

“生存？用什么？” 真嗣咕哝道。

He didn't have anything except the lighter he had brought, and a lot of good it had done him; he hadn't even bothered making a fire since he had left. He didn't even think he had flicked it on since then.

他除了随身携带的打火机外一无所有，而这打火机对他也没多大帮助；自从离开后，他甚至都没费心去生火。他甚至不记得自那以后是否打开过它。

Bringing it out of his pocket, he flicked it on and watched the flame dance in front of him for several seconds until he flicked it off. He stuffed it back in his pocket and stood up, throwing his arms above him as he reached to the sky. Clouds loomed above him. They weren't exactly dark, but Shinji didn't think it would take much for that to change.

他从口袋里掏出打火机，啪地一声打开，看着火焰在他面前跳动了几秒钟，然后又关掉了。他把打火机塞回口袋，站起身来，双臂向上伸展，仿佛要触摸天空。乌云在他头顶聚集。它们并不算阴沉，但真嗣觉得要变天并不需要太久。

Again, he was having second thoughts, thoughts he couldn't spare to have.

又一次，他开始犹豫不决，这些思绪本是他无暇顾及的。

But- 但是——

"Damn it," grumbled Shinji.

“该死，”真嗣咕哝道。

Which path should he choose? What would be best for him? Was it better to fight on his own, or share it with someone?

他该选择哪条路？什么对他最好？独自战斗更好，还是与他人分担？

'I've never craved human interactions...I've always associated with people as little as possible, but now, I'm being forced into it almost. And though I don't know for certain, I almost feel that it has been the same for her...for Asuka.'

'我从未渴望过人际交往……我一直尽可能少地与人接触，但现在，我几乎是被迫卷入其中。虽然我不确定，但我几乎感觉这对她来说也是一样的……对明日香来说。'

It had been a long time since he had spoken her name, and he was surprised how easily the words came to his lips, almost as they were always there, just waiting to be spoken.

他已经很久没有说出她的名字了，他惊讶于这些话竟如此轻易地脱口而出，仿佛它们一直就在那里，只等着被说出来。

'She hates me, and I hate her. Okay, fair enough, but I don't think we have a choice but to live together for the time being, whether we like it or not.'

'她恨我，我也恨她。好吧，公平合理，但我认为我们别无选择，暂时只能住在一起，不管我们是否愿意。'

Shinji turned his gaze then towards the hill that he had climbed down earlier that day.

真嗣随后将目光转向了那天早些时候他爬下来的那座小山。

'How much of an idiot have I been?' wondered Shinji.

“我到底有多傻？”真嗣心想。

He was afraid to know the truth honestly, as he didn't know what would await him on that beach now.

他害怕诚实地面对真相，因为他不知道现在那片海滩上会有什么在等着他。

'If she's alive...she is...'

'如果她还活着...她就是...'

'And if not?' '如果不是呢？'

Shinji didn't respond, not wanting to think about a what if scenario. If that was true though, and that she had died because of his selfishness, he wouldn't be long for this world either.

真嗣没有回应，不想去设想那种假设性的情景。但如果那是真的，她因他的自私而死去，那么他也不会在这个世界上停留太久。

"If I take short breaks, I should be able to reach her within three days," mumbled Shinji.

"如果我短暂休息，应该能在三天内到达她那里，" 新司喃喃自语。

He didn't see a problem with his stamina, which he hadn't had much of a problem with. It was the water that he was worried about, if only a little.

他并不担心自己的体力，这方面他一直没遇到太大问题。他担心的是水，虽然只是稍微有些担忧。

"It shouldn't become a problem," Shinji told himself before he started retracing his steps to a life he had almost abandoned.

"这应该不会成为问题，" 新司自言自语，然后开始重走他几乎放弃的生活之路。

Asuka didn't wake back up at all the rest of the day, and whether her leg pained her in her fitful sleep, she didn't know. When she did wake up the next day, the dream she had been having hit her.

那天剩下的时间里，明日香再也没有醒来，她不知道在断断续续的睡眠中，腿是否还在疼痛。直到第二天醒来，她才意识到自己做了个梦。

She had been warm, which was a stark contrast to how she felt now. But it was more than that, it had been a memory that she hadn't thought of in a long time. A time before everything had gone wrong. When she had been happy, when her mother was still alive, when her...

梦中她感到温暖，这与她现在的感觉形成了鲜明对比。但这不仅仅是温暖，那是一个久未想起的记忆。在一切出错之前，在她还幸福的时候，在她母亲还活着的时候，在她……

Asuka cut herself off then; she didn't need to be thinking about that first thing in the morning.

明日香随即打住了思绪；她不需要一大早就去想这些。

The warmth though had unfortunately been a lie, and it was probably brought on by the fact that her body itself was unusually cold.

然而，那份温暖不幸地是个谎言，这可能是因为她自身的体温异常寒冷所致。

It took Asuka a few seconds to remember the disastrous attempt at getting water the day before and the assault of pain that had followed. She had slept outside the sleeping bag and only now realized the wetness that covered the sleeping bag. Surprised by this suddenly, she leaned to her left and placed on a hand on the sand; it was wet.

过了几秒钟，明日香才回想起前一天取水的灾难性尝试以及随之而来的剧痛。她睡在睡袋外面，直到现在才意识到睡袋上的潮湿。突然间感到惊讶，她向左倾斜，将手放在沙子上；沙子是湿的。

'Did it rain last night?' wondered Asuka.

“昨晚下雨了吗？”明日香疑惑道。

This seemed to be the most obvious reason, and as Asuka looked at the sleeping bag closer, she noticed that it was soaked as well. She only hadn't noticed it before because she herself was freezing. If not for the plug suit, she would be even more cold she reminded herself. At least it did trap some heat.

这似乎是最显而易见的原因，当明日香更仔细地观察睡袋时，她发现它也湿透了。之前她没有注意到，只是因为她自己也冻得够呛。她暗自提醒，要不是有插电服，她会更冷。至少它确实能留住一些热量。

'Well this sucks,' thought Asuka.

“真是糟透了。”明日香心想。

As if things couldn't get any worse, her legs started to ache. Not terribly, but Asuka guessed that with her body temperature the way it was, it was only a matter of time before it hurt more. The sun at least was high in the sky now, so at most it would warm up eventually.

仿佛事情还不够糟糕，她的双腿开始酸痛。虽然不算剧烈，但明日香猜测，以她目前的体温状况，疼痛加剧只是时间问题。至少现在太阳高挂天空，最终应该会带来些许温暖。

Asuka had only this to look forward to.

明日香只能期待这一点。

Though as the day continued, even that didn't seem to show much promise. Though the sun was in the sky, the ocean breeze that came over the beach was icy and stung her already cold skin.

然而随着时间的推移，就连这一点似乎也显得希望渺茫。尽管阳光普照，海风掠过沙滩时依旧冰冷刺骨，让本已寒冷的皮肤更加难受。

Without anyway to keep warm Asuka was left to turn away from the ocean and let the wind hit her back.

没有任何取暖的办法，明日香只能转身背对大海，任由风打在她的背上。

As day progressed into night, hunger was starting to hit her. The empty water bottle that she had filled yesterday lay empty beside her. Eventually, she had ignored the coldness of the sleeping bag and bundled up inside of it. The combination of her body temperature and cotton of the sleeping bag would get warmer faster instead of being left by itself.

随着白天渐渐转为黑夜，饥饿感开始袭来。昨天装满的水瓶现在空空如也，躺在她身边。最终，她忽略了睡袋的寒冷，蜷缩在里面。她的体温和睡袋的棉质材料相结合，会比单独放置时更快变暖。

Asuka sneezed suddenly and felt a chill go down her spine. Now of all times, was she really getting a cold? There wasn't much she could do about that except bury herself deeper into the sleeping bag.

明日香突然打了个喷嚏，感到一阵寒意直窜脊梁。偏偏在这个时候，她真的要感冒了吗？除了把自己更深地埋进睡袋里，她对此无能为力。

Late into the night, Asuka was awoken by the pain in her legs. It felt like it was on fire...or was the her forehead? She felt cold, but her head was burning hot.

深夜时分，明日香被腿部的剧痛惊醒。那感觉如同烈火焚身，又或是额头在燃烧？她感到寒冷，但头部却滚烫如火。

'A fever?' she thought dazedly.

'发烧了？' 她昏昏沉沉地想。

The coldness was finally starting to do its work on her.

那股寒意终于开始在她身上发挥作用了。

The next day was much the same as the previous. In the morning, Asuka felt slightly better, but as the day began to change to night, the fever and pain of her legs started up quickly. She wasn't sure whether dehydration was a factor in this, but she had started hallucinating. Her dreams were more wild and random now. Half formed images swam in front of her eyes of her dead mother and other people she had known in her short life. Was this how everything was going to end? On the beach of Tokyo-3, freezing to death and dying of starvation and a fever?

次日与前一天并无二致。清晨，明日香感觉稍有好转，但随着白昼渐逝，夜幕降临，高烧与腿部的疼痛迅速袭来。她不确定脱水是否是诱因，但已经开始出现幻觉。她的梦境如今愈发狂野无序，半成形的影像在她眼前浮现，有她已故的母亲，还有她短暂生命中认识的其他人。难道一切就要这样终结吗？在第三新东京市的海滩上，因寒冷、饥饿与高烧而死去？

What could she do though?

但她能做什么呢？

'I wonder what he's doing,' Asuka thought suddenly.

'不知道他在做什么呢，'明日香突然想到。

His face came into her mind then, and held her attention for a brief moment. But no, he was miles away by now, and even if he decided to come back, she'd already be dead by then.

他的面容随即浮现在她脑海中，短暂地吸引了她的注意力。但不行，他现在已远在千里之外，即便他决定回来，那时她也已经不在了。

As Asuka thought this, the weight of what was happening came crashing down on top of her.

当明日香想到这里时，所发生的一切的重压突然间如山崩般压在了她的身上。

She was going to die, it was as simple as that.

她即将死去，事情就是如此简单。

Dying was something that she had somewhat excepted. As an Evangelion pilot, it was something that she had to live with. She knew that, but dying like this was unbefitting of her. Helpless and unable to do anything, she hated herself for this.

死亡对她来说并非完全陌生。作为一名 EVA 驾驶员，她早已习惯了与之共存。她明白这一点，但像这样死去，却与她的身份格格不入。无助且什么都做不了，她痛恨这样的自己。

At the last though, she wouldn't cry. She had already cried once, and that was more the pain than anything, but she wouldn't cry now. She wouldn't give him the satisfaction of that. Even if she was impaled, she wouldn't cry.

尽管心中难过，她却不会哭泣。她已经哭过一次，那更多是因为疼痛而非其他，但现在她不会再哭了。她不会让他因此感到得意。即便被刺穿，她也不会流泪。

She never knew the irony of that thought.

她从未意识到那个想法的讽刺之处。

Sleep came and went that night, and the pain was unrelenting, not giving her a second to think. Her mind felt like it was on fire from the fever, and thinking clearly was nigh on impossible. Her thoughts came and went and her vision was murky from the pain. Her body would cease functioning and everything would be released. She had read during biology that when an animal died, its excrement was released. Was that going to happen to her? Was her body going to be soiled? Would it matter though? She'd be dead after all.

那一夜，睡眠时来时去，痛苦却毫不间断，不给她片刻思考的余地。她的头脑因高烧而如同燃烧，清晰思考几乎成了奢望。思绪飘忽不定，视线因疼痛而模糊。她的身体机能即将停止，一切都将随之释放。她在生物课上读到过，动物死亡时会排出排泄物。这会发生在她身上吗？她的身体会因此受污吗？然而，这又有什么关系呢？毕竟，她终将死去。

Death didn't come that night though, and Asuka was left to suffer through it. If not for the plug suit though, she'd have died sooner she reminded herself.

然而，死亡并未在那一夜降临，明日香只能独自承受这一切。若非有插入栓服的保护，她提醒自己，或许早已命丧黄泉。

The next day dawned, warmer than the previous, but Asuka didn't feel better in the slightest. The sun beat down on her, turning her freezing body burning hot. Her legs still felt cold and dead though, and she was starting to wonder if they hadn't died already.

次日清晨来临，比前一日更为温暖，但明日香丝毫未感好转。阳光炙烤着她，将她冰冷的身体变得滚烫。然而，她的双腿依旧感觉冰冷而麻木，她开始怀疑它们是否已经死去。

Time ceased to matter to her, and every second felt like hours to her. She just wanted it to end already. Take away the pain, then she could rest. At this point, death was almost a welcoming thing to her. Towering over her constantly, stretching its long fingers out to her, she only had to reach out and grasp that reality. What held her back though? Her stubbornness maybe? Her strong will to survive, to never give up, to kick and scream until her body was ripped apart? Was there a point to all this though?

时间对她已无意义，每一秒都如同数小时般漫长。她只希望这一切能快点结束。消除痛苦，她才能得以安息。此刻，死亡对她来说几乎是一种慰藉。它始终高耸在她上方，伸出长长的手指向她，她只需伸手抓住那个现实。然而，是什么阻止了她？或许是她的固执？她强烈的生存意志，永不放弃，直到身体被撕裂也要挣扎和尖叫？这一切还有意义吗？

When did day become night and night become day? When had she realized time was passing again? When did her body stop responding to her demands? When had she stopped caring?

何时白昼变成了黑夜，黑夜又变成了白昼？她何时意识到时间再次流逝？她的身体何时停止了对她命令的响应？她何时停止了关心？

Something within her seemed to go on though, amidst her wishes for everything to end.

尽管她希望一切结束，但内心深处似乎有什么东西仍在继续。

Day did turn into night, and everything was beginning to come to a close. The ocean breeze blew across the sand, sending the tiny crystals across each other. The waves crashed upon one another as the surf stretched towards the beach, its white foam standing out in the darkness.

白昼确实转为了黑夜，一切似乎都即将落幕。海风掠过沙滩，吹动着细小的沙粒相互摩擦。海浪相互撞击，浪花向着海滩延伸，白色的泡沫在黑暗中格外显眼。

Asuka lay still as death inside the sleeping bag. Birds flew above her, landing here and there, curious about the strange shape on the beach. A turtle walked on the beach, oblivious to the ongoing troubles of the teenage girl, lying half dead in the sleeping bag.

明日香静静地躺在睡袋里，宛如死去一般。鸟儿在她上方飞翔，时而落下，对海滩上这个奇怪的形状感到好奇。一只海龟在沙滩上漫步，对躺在睡袋里半死不活的少女的烦恼浑然不觉。

Death had reached out to her.

死亡已向她伸出了手。

An empty white room, devoid of anything greeted Asuka.

一个空无一物的白色房间，没有任何东西迎接明日香。

She was naked. 她一丝不挂。

Death...had called out to her. Had she accepted, or was it simply time? Had her time run out?

死亡...曾向她呼唤。是她接受了，还是时间到了？她的时间已经耗尽了吗？

She didn't move, she just stood in the whiteness. She couldn't think, she couldn't move, she couldn't speak. What was she waiting for?

她没有动，只是站在那片白色中。她无法思考，无法移动，无法说话。她在等待什么？

Something was coming though, she could feel it. She wanted to move forward towards whatever it was. Her feet wouldn't listen to her, much as they had these past days.

但有什么正在靠近，她能感觉到。她想朝那未知之物前进。她的双脚却不听使唤，就像这些天来一样。

Move she told them. 走，她告诉他们。

They didn't. 他们没动。

But the thing got closer...the darkness.

但那东西越来越近了...那片黑暗。

Darkness. Death. Despair.

黑暗。死亡。绝望。

She was afraid now; death was coming for her.

她现在害怕了；死亡正向她逼近。

No, I'm not ready yet.

不，我还没准备好。

Whether she was ready or not, death would reach her; it always found its target.

无论她是否准备好，死亡终将降临；它总能找到目标。

Run! Run! RUN! 跑！跑！快跑！

Her legs still didn't move.

她的双腿依旧动弹不得。

The darkness grew closer. She could now feel the presence of whatever lay waiting for her in the darkness. A hand maybe? A ghastly face? Something...

黑暗愈发逼近。她现在能感觉到黑暗中潜伏着的东西，等待着她的到来。是一只手吗？还是一张骇人的脸？亦或是其他什么...

Or was the darkness something else? Had everything been false? Was she still there? It was always dark there afterall.

或者，黑暗是另一种存在？一切都是虚假的吗？她还在那里吗？毕竟，那里总是漆黑一片。

Even more than death, she didn't want that. Her fears gave way.

比起死亡，她更不希望那样。她的恐惧让步了。

Tears were forming at the corners of her eyes now. She told herself she wouldn't cry though, not ever again.

泪水此刻正在她眼角凝聚。她告诉自己，不会再哭了，再也不会了。

She held them back, afraid for what was to come.

她强忍着，对即将到来的事情感到恐惧。

I don't want this. 我不想要这样。

I want to continue living.

我想继续活下去。

I'm not ready to die.

我还没准备好去死。

Why would death listen though? What reason did it have to care? It was only fulfilling its only design.

但死亡为何要听从呢？它有什么理由去关心？它只是在履行它唯一的设计。

I don't care! 我不在乎！

Neither does death. 死亡亦然。

Something cared though...

但有什么在意着……

A pressure...something on the back of Asuka's shoulders suddenly grabbed her. Not forcefully, but carefully. Startled, Asuka tried turning her head to see what it was, but her head wouldn't move. It was warm though.

一种压力……有什么东西突然抓住了明日香的双肩。不是粗暴地，而是小心翼翼地。明日香惊慌失措，试图转头去看那是什么，但她的头却动弹不得。不过，那触感是温暖的。

The pressure, the weight, was suddenly pulling her backwards. She was tilting downwards now; something was guiding her.

压力，重量，突然间将她向后拉扯。她现在正倾斜向下；有什么在引导她。

A hand? Somebody? Who? 一只手？某个人？是谁？

The darkness rushed towards her now, determined to claim her. If Asuka could have, she would have screamed then, but something stopped her. Though very echoey, a voice filled her mind suddenly.

黑暗此刻向她席卷而来，决心要吞噬她。如果明日香能发出声音，她那时一定会尖叫，但某种力量阻止了她。虽然回声重重，一个声音突然充满了她的脑海。

"Its alright, I've got you."

“没事的，我在这儿。”

Asuka felt herself being pulled backwards now, and felt something wash over her, almost as though she had been pulled through a waterfall. The darkness grew murky then, but it seemed to have stopped, unable to pass through the waterfall as she had.

明日香感到自己正被向后拉扯，一种类似穿越瀑布的感觉涌上心头。黑暗变得混沌，但似乎已停滞不前，无法像她那样穿越那道瀑布。

She was suddenly conscious of her body. Feeling was returning, as was her voice. She turned towards the feeling behind her, that was pulling her onwards. A shape...a human?

她突然意识到自己的身体。感觉正在恢复，声音也是。她转向身后的感觉，那股牵引她前行的力量。一个形状...一个人类？

The whiteness was now disappearing, becoming a tiny dot in the distance. Neither darkness nor light surrounded her, she just existed in empty space along with whatever was pulling her.

那片白色正在消失，变成远处的一个小点。既非黑暗也非光明包围着她，她只是与那股牵引她的力量一同存在于虚空之中。

Something behind her though was growing brighter. Light? Sunlight?

然而，她身后的某物正变得越来越亮。光？阳光？

As she neared the light, everything started to grow clearer.

当她接近那束光时，一切开始变得清晰起来。

Until- 直到——

Light was what she had seen, but it wasn't sunlight.

她所见的是光，但那并非阳光。

Her eyes opened slowly and painfully. Her forehead still burned hot but something was cooling it now. She was on her back, this much she recognized. Everything was painful though, just moving her head took a lot of work.

她的眼睛缓缓地、痛苦地睁开。额头依旧滚烫，但此刻有什么在给它降温。她仰面躺着，这一点她认出来了。尽管如此，一切都疼痛难忍，仅仅是转动头部就费了好大劲。

What she had mistaken for sunlight was a roaring fire though and she was laying right next to it. She was wrapped in the sleeping bag which was now much warmer then she had last remembered it.

她误以为是阳光的，其实是一团熊熊燃烧的火焰，而她就躺在它的旁边。她裹在睡袋里，现在比她记忆中的任何时候都要暖和。

Her eyes roamed around the fire for several seconds, taking everything in.

她的目光在火堆周围徘徊了好几秒，细细打量着四周的一切。

She was alive was she not?

她还活着，不是吗？

As if in response to her question, someone answered her.

仿佛是对她的问题作出回应，有人回答了她。

"Finally awake..." “终于醒了……”

The voice was very hoarse and rough and Asuka barely recognized it. How many days had it been since she had heard that voice?

声音异常沙哑粗糙，明日香几乎没认出来。她已经有多少天没听到这个声音了？

Shinji came into view, walking around the edge of the fire until he was standing several feet in front of her. He had dark shadows under his eyes and he looked much older than the last time she had seen him. Asuka wasn't sure how to respond.

真嗣出现在视野中，他绕着火堆边缘走，直到站在她面前几英尺的地方。他眼底有深重的阴影，看起来比上次见面时苍老了许多。明日香不确定该如何回应。

Shinji looked her over once before he sighed with relief and sat down close to her.

真嗣仔细打量了她一番，然后松了口气，坐到了她身边。

Asuka had several questions floating around in her brain, but she was still too tired to ask any of them.

明日香脑中浮现出许多问题，但她仍然太疲倦，无法开口询问。

She was alive though, and that was enough for her right now.

不过她还活着，这对她来说已经足够了。

Asuka stared into the fire for a long time, ignoring Shinji who sat almost directly next to her. She didn't care about this close proximity...not right now.

明日香长时间凝视着火焰，无视几乎直接坐在她旁边的真嗣。她现在并不在意这种近距离……至少此刻不在乎。

After several long moments though, Asuka felt something brush against her forehead and then the coolness was gone for a second. What replaced it was a warm hand.

然而，过了好一会儿，明日香感觉到有什么东西轻触她的额头，随后那股凉意一闪即逝。取而代之的是一只温暖的手。

"Still have a fever," mumbled Shinji quietly, more to himself than to her. Though Asuka didn't see him, she heard him stand up and walk behind her, his feet crunching as he walked across the sand. Asuka didn't have the energy to even complain about this.

“还在发烧，”真嗣低声咕哝，与其说是对她说的，不如说是自言自语。尽管明日香没看见他，但她听到他站起身，走到她身后，脚踩在沙子上发出嘎吱声。明日香连抱怨的力气都没有了。

After several minutes went by, Shinji came back and lay the piece of cloth against Asuka's forehead, newly soaked in the surf of Tokyo-3. Asuka felt some of the watery LCL fluid drip from the cloth and slide down her cheek. It was certainly cooler than before. Had he been doing this every hour?

几分钟过去后，真嗣回来了，将一块新浸透了东京-3 海浪的布料敷在明日香的额头上。明日香感觉到一些水状的 LCL 液体从布上滴落，滑过她的脸颊。确实比之前凉快了些。他是不是每小时都在这么做？

Shinji went around to the other side of the fire then and grabbed something off the ground that happened to be a water bottle filled with the watery LCL fluid. Bringing it around to Asuka's side he unscrewed the cap and held it in his hands.

真嗣绕到火堆的另一边，从地上捡起一个装满了水状 LCL 液体的水瓶。他拿着它走到明日香这边，拧开瓶盖，握在手中。

Asuka didn't need to be told what he wanted her to do, and she was thankful that he didn't ask. She opened her small mouth and Shinji tipped the water slowly into her mouth, giving her only a mouth full. It helped nonetheless.

明日香无需被告知他希望她做什么，她感激他没有开口询问。她张开小嘴，真嗣缓缓将水倒入她口中，只给她一口的量。尽管如此，这还是有所帮助。

He capped it and stood up, placing it on the other side of the fire. Walking back around the fire, he sat down beside Asuka and rested his head in his hands.

他拧紧瓶盖，站起身来，将其放在火堆的另一侧。绕过火堆走回来，他在明日香身旁坐下，双手托着头休息。

Asuka wanted to know what had happened, how it was that she was still alive, but she figured that could wait for another day. The only thing that she knew right now, was that she was glad Shinji was with her. This puzzled her slightly, but she ignored it, attributing it to the fact that he had saved her life.

明日香想知道发生了什么，她是如何活下来的，但她觉得这可以等到另一天再探究。她现在唯一清楚的是，她很高兴真嗣在她身边。这让她有些困惑，但她没有深究，归因于他救了她一命的事实。

They stayed like that for several minutes, both staring into the fire. Eventually, Shinji stood up and walked to the other side of the fire where he grabbed a water bottle and drank several drops from it.

他们就这样坐了几分钟，两人都凝视着火堆。最终，真嗣站起身，走到火堆的另一边，拿起一个水瓶，喝了几口水。

Finishing he said, "You should sleep if you can. You were through a lot and..."

喝完后他说道：“你应该尽量睡一会儿。你经历了很多……”

Shinji left his sentence dangling, the weariness in his voice apparent. Asuka wanted to tell him to sleep as well, but she had a feeling that he wouldn't. She had a feeling he hadn't gotten much sleep in several days

真嗣的话悬而未决，声音中的疲惫显而易见。明日香想让他也去睡觉，但她有种感觉，他不会去。她有种感觉，他已经好几天没怎么睡了。

Instead, she nodded quietly, and curled back into the sleeping bag, almost like a cat. It was unbelievably warm now with the fire next to her and the sleeping bag covering her.

相反，她静静地点了点头，蜷缩回睡袋里，几乎像只猫一样。现在，火堆旁的温暖和睡袋的覆盖让她感到难以置信的暖和。

Asuka fell asleep peacefully, no longer assaulted by pain or nightmares. She dreamed peacefully that night forgetting everything that had happened the past few days.

明日香安然入睡，不再受疼痛或噩梦的侵扰。那一晚，她平静地做着梦，忘记了过去几天发生的一切。

Across from her, Shinji felt like a giant weight was lifted from his shoulders. Knowing that she was alive and well put his mind at ease. It had been close, but she was alright now.

在她对面，真嗣感到肩上的重担仿佛被卸下了。得知她安然无恙，他的心终于安定下来。虽然情况一度危急，但她现在一切都好。

Letting out a low sigh, he decided he could afford himself two hours of sleep before he had to wake back up and check on her.

他低声叹了口气，决定自己可以奢侈地睡上两个小时，然后再醒来检查她的情况。

Like this, the two of them bonded together. Though they had resented each other, they had been forced to work together in order to survive in this world.

就这样，两人紧密地联系在一起。尽管他们曾彼此怨恨，但为了在这个世界生存下去，他们不得不被迫合作。

### Chapter 4: Connection

Well its New Years Eve, so I got a double post for everybody to read whenever the hangover wears off. These two chapters are to make up for the fact that I didn't get much done between now and my last post (which was back in October). Hopefully we'll see another chapter sometime in January, but again, depends on what happens with my schedule.

既然是新年夜，我给大家准备了双更，可以在宿醉消退时阅读。这两章是为了弥补从现在到我上次更新（那还是十月份的事）之间我完成不多的情况。希望一月份能再看到一篇 chapter，不过这还得看我的日程安排如何。

---

The sun rose on the horizon over the bay of Tokyo-3, piercing Shinji's eyes open. Yesterday had been such a whirl of things happening that he could barely remember getting back. He hadn't gotten much sleep last night, and was feeling extremely tired now. Every bone in his body was aching, but at least the girl sleeping across the fire from him was sleeping peacefully.

太阳在东京-3 湾的地平线上升起，刺眼的阳光让真嗣睁开了眼睛。昨天发生了太多事情，他几乎记不清是怎么回来的。昨晚他没怎么睡，现在感到非常疲惫。全身的骨头都在痛，但至少对面火堆旁的女孩正安详地睡着。

He wasn't sure how he was able to force his body awake every few hours to check on her, but he had someone managed it. Her fever had slowly left her body and she seemed to be feeling better now, but that was just what Shinji could tell from the outside at least.

他不确定自己是怎么做到每隔几小时就强迫身体醒来检查她的，但他确实做到了。她的高烧已慢慢退去，现在看起来感觉好多了，但至少从外表上看，这是真嗣能判断的。

He stood up now and stretched, walking over to the surf to refill his water bottle with the strange fluid. It had a bitter taste to it, but it did quench his thirst at least.

他现在站起身来，伸了个懒腰，走到海边用那种奇怪的液体重新装满水壶。它有一种苦涩的味道，但至少能解渴。

He tried remembering the journey he had taken to get here, but it was such a blur. He had forced himself onward with little sleep to the point that he was afraid he would almost have to start crawling, but his body seemed to bare with the strain. He was puzzled by this immensely, as in all likely hood, he should have probably died of exhaustion. Maybe it was his will that kept him moving forward, but he just wasn't sure.

他试图回忆起自己来到这里的旅程，但那一切都是模糊的。他几乎没有睡觉，强迫自己继续前进，以至于他担心自己几乎要开始爬行，但他的身体似乎承受住了这种压力。这让他感到非常困惑，因为按理说，他很可能已经死于疲劳。也许是他坚强的意志让他继续前进，但他也不太确定。

Walking back to the makeshift camp, he placed more wood on the fire stacking it higher to keep himself and Asuka warm. It didn't seem like it would get too cold like it had two days ago, but he didn't want to take any chances.

走回临时营地，他将更多的木柴加到火堆上，堆得更高以保持自己和明日香温暖。看起来不像两天前那样会变得太冷，但他不想冒任何风险。

Several hours passed by and he continued waiting for her, checking up on her every half hour or so. She was breathing easily now, whereas it had been strained before. He had been worried that she may have come down with pneumonia, but that didn't seem to be the case. At least that was one thing he didn't have to worry about right now. The only problem was she still probably couldn't move her legs, which meant that they where still stuck here for a little longer.

几个小时过去了，他继续等待着她，每隔半小时左右就查看一下她的情况。现在她的呼吸变得轻松了，而之前是有些吃力的。他曾担心她可能得了肺炎，但现在看来并非如此。至少这是他现在不必担心的一件事。唯一的问题是她可能仍然无法移动双腿，这意味着他们还得在这里多待一会儿。

As Shinji was just starting to nod off however, Asuka finally started to stir. She slowly rose to a sitting position, struggling as her feet still refused to obey her commands. The sleeping bag slid off her body, revealing the plug suit clinging to her body and her hair started billowing in the calm sea breeze. The sleepiness left Shinji as he watched her slowly awake and Asuka turned her head to look at him.

然而，正当真嗣快要打瞌睡时，明日香终于开始动了。她慢慢地坐起身来，挣扎着，因为她的双脚仍然不听使唤。睡袋从她身上滑落，露出了紧贴身体的插入栓服和她开始在平静的海风中飘扬的头发。真嗣的睡意消失了，他看着她慢慢醒来，明日香转过头来看着他。

They both looked at each other across the fire and it was Asuka who first spoke.

他们隔着火光对视，最终是明日香率先开口。

"What time is it?" “现在几点了？”

"A few hours before noon I think," replied Shinji evenly. He wasn't sure where there relationship was exactly, but didn't think she would try attacking him again. Not after last night.

"“我想是中午前几个小时吧，”真嗣平静地回答。他不太确定他们之间的关系究竟如何，但觉得她不会再试图攻击他了。至少不会是昨晚之后。”

Asuka was silent again for a few seconds before she asked, "When did you get back?"

明日香又沉默了几秒钟，然后问道：“你什么时候回来的？”

"...I'm not sure," said Shinji slowly. "Sometime last night I know."

"...我不确定，" 真嗣缓缓地说，"应该是昨晚某个时候。"

"I see," mumbled Asuka. She was remembering the vivid dream she had last night, wondering if it had been Shinji who she had seen.

"我明白了，" 明日香喃喃自语。她回想起昨晚那个生动的梦，想知道是否在梦中见到的人就是真嗣。

"How are you feeling?" asked Shinji.

"你感觉怎么样？" 真嗣问道。

"Better I guess, my fever seems like it's gone...my legs still wont move though."

“感觉好些了，我想我的烧退了……不过腿还是动不了。”

'As much as I figured,' thought Shinji.

“正如我所料，”真嗣心想。

Grabbing a nearby water bottle, Shinji walked around the side of the fire and handed it to Asuka. Asuka took it wordlessly, not wanting to admit how thirsty she was, and drank several mouthfuls. Wiping her mouth, she placed the water bottle beside her let out a sigh before looking up at Shinji.

真嗣拿起附近的一瓶水，绕过火堆走到明日香身边递给她。明日香默默接过，不想承认自己有多渴，喝了几大口。她擦了擦嘴，把水瓶放在身边，叹了口气，然后抬头看向真嗣。

"So, where did you go?"

"那么，你去哪儿了？"

Shinji couldn't help but notice the annoyance in her voice, but didn't want to start anything. Replying passively, he said-

真嗣不禁注意到她语气中的不悦，但他不想引发任何争执。他被动地回答道——

"The valley behind Tokyo-3."

"东京-3 后面的山谷。"

Asuka blinked several times, surprised at this answer. How far away was that exactly?

明日香眨了几次眼，对这个回答感到惊讶。那究竟有多远呢？

"Isn't that several miles away?"

“那不是有好几英里远吗？”

"...It is," mumbled Shinji.

“是的，”真嗣咕哝道。

Asuka raised an eyebrow at him, surprised that he could still be standing after making that journey. What did he do, run all the way back here?

明日香对他挑了挑眉，惊讶于他在经历了那样的旅程后还能站立。他做了什么，一路跑回来的吗？

'Does it really matter though,' thought Asuka as her gaze dropped the the ground. 'If he hadn't come back, I'd be dead right now.'

'不过，这真的重要吗？'明日香目光低垂，心中暗想。'如果他没有回来，我现在已经死了。'

That thought made her shiver slightly, so she wrapped the sleeping bag around her slightly and moved closer to the fire.

这个念头让她微微颤抖，于是她稍微裹紧了睡袋，向火堆靠近了些。

"And, was there anything worthwhile that you found while over there?"

"那么，你在那边有没有发现什么有价值的东西？"

"No," said Shinji quietly, as he sat down across the fire from her. "Nor, did I see anybody while I was walking to and from. Most likely, we're the only ones in a several mile radius."

"没有，" 真嗣轻声说道，他在火堆对面坐下。"我来回走的时候也没看到任何人。很可能，我们方圆几英里内只有我们两个。"

"Or the entire world for that matter," said Asuka almost to herself.

"或者说整个世界都是如此，" 明日香几乎是自言自语地说道。"

Shinji was silent, wondering about the meaning behind Asuka's words. She was different, no use getting around that fact. She seemed to live in a different world then he did almost.

真嗣沉默了，思索着明日香话语背后的含义。她的确与众不同，这一点无可回避。她似乎生活在一个与他截然不同的世界里。

"Hey...Asuka?" mumbled Shinji after a few seconds pause. Asuka looked back at him slowly, apparently still getting used to hearing him use her name. She couldn't say she liked it, but there wasn't much she could do about it.

“嘿...明日香？”真嗣在几秒钟的停顿后含糊地问道。明日香缓缓回头看向他，显然还在适应他直接叫她的名字。虽然她并不喜欢这样，但也无计可施。

"What?" she replied bluntly.

“什么？”她直截了当地回答。

Shinji hesitated under her glare.

在她的瞪视下，真嗣犹豫了。

"Who...Who are you exactly? I mean...we seem the same age, but..."

“你……你到底是谁？我是说……我们看起来年纪相仿，但是……”

Shinji trailed off, unsure where he was going. It wasn't as if she was an alien of some sort, but he still felt awkward asking her about personal questions.

真嗣话说到一半就停住了，不确定自己想表达什么。她并非什么外星人，但他仍觉得问私人问题很尴尬。

"Who am I?" said Asuka feeling puzzled suddenly. "Are you stupid? I already told you my name!"

"我是谁？" 明日香突然感到困惑。"你傻吗？我已经告诉过你我的名字了！"

"No...I didn't mean like that," replied Shinji hurriedly.

"不...我不是那个意思，" 真嗣急忙回答。

"Then what did you mean moron?"

"那你是什么意思，笨蛋？"

Shinji was having a hard time not raising his voice in reply to her abusive talk, but he held himself back. Now was not the time to be bickering with each other.

真嗣很难不提高声音回应她的辱骂，但他还是忍住了。现在不是互相争吵的时候。

"Well, for instance, the way you're dressed," said Shinji as he pointed at the plug suit she was wearing. "And also what you said before about the water being fit for drinking. How could you know something like that? The water even almost smells like blood."

“比如说，你这身打扮，”真嗣指着她穿的插入栓服说道，“还有你之前说水适合饮用的事。你怎么可能知道那种事？那水甚至闻起来像血一样。”

Asuka glared back at him, not bothering to hide her displeasure about being asked these questions.

明日香瞪着他，毫不掩饰自己被问这些问题的反感。

"Didn't I already tell you that everything would be better off if we didn't know anything about each other?"

“我不是早就告诉过你，如果我们对彼此一无所知，一切都会更好吗？”

"Yeah, well, things have changed a bit since then," replied Shinji, not backing down.

“是啊，不过，从那以后情况有些变化，”真嗣回答道，毫不退让。

Asuka bit her lip. In truth, what Shinji said had merit to it, especially if they were expected to live like this for a while. Some things were better left unsaid however.

明日香咬了咬嘴唇。事实上，真嗣的话不无道理，尤其是如果他们预计要这样生活一段时间的话。然而，有些事情还是不说为妙。

Relaxing somewhat, Asuka reached for the water bottle she had placed earlier beside her and drank several mouthfuls. The LCL fluid reminded of her past in Germany. How many days had she even been in Tokyo-3 before this had happened. It surely couldn't have been more than a week.

稍稍放松下来，Asuka 伸手拿起之前放在身旁的水瓶，喝了几大口。LCL 液体让她想起了在德国的过往。她在东京-3 才待了几天就发生了这种事。肯定不超过一周。

Placing the water bottle beside her again, she took several minutes until she was sitting in front of Shinji with the fire blazing between them before she started talking.

再次将水瓶放在她身旁，她花了好几分钟才坐到真嗣对面，火焰在他们之间熊熊燃烧，随后她才开始说话。

"Do you know what Second Impact is?"

"你知道什么是第二次冲击吗？"

"Er...wasn't that something that happened in Antarctica, and because of that much of the marine wildlife died off?"

"呃...那不是发生在南极的事情吗，因为那次事件，很多海洋生物都灭绝了？"

Asuka didn't say anything for several seconds, gauging her words on how much she should tell him.

绫波没有立即回答，她沉默了几秒钟，斟酌着应该告诉他多少。

"Well, thats the gist of it somewhat. True, marine wildlife has died off except for aquariums and special laboratories that breed them. Second Impact though, is a whole different thing then what the government has led the public to believe. In reality, it was an experiment that went wrong...what the experiment was though, I'm not sure."

"嗯，大致上是这样。确实，海洋生物除了水族馆和特殊实验室培育的之外，已经灭绝了。但第二次冲击，与政府向公众所宣称的完全不同。实际上，那是一场实验出了差错……至于实验的具体内容，我也不清楚。"

"Were you part of this experiment?"

"你参与了这场实验吗？"

"That was like sixteen year ago you moron! I wasn't even born yet!"

"那是十六年前的事了，你这个白痴！我那时还没出生呢！"

"Oh right...sorry," said Shinji hurriedly. He had never been great at history.

"哦对了...抱歉，" 真嗣急忙说道。他对历史一直不太擅长。

It took a while before Asuka was calm again, though when she was, she continued talking.

过了一会儿，明日香才再次平静下来，尽管如此，她还是继续说了下去。

"Anyways, that experiment was part of one large project that was conducted by a company called Gehirn. I don't suppose you've ever heard of it, since its headquartered in Germany, which is where I'm from."

"总之，那个实验是一个名为 Gehirn 的公司所进行的大型项目的一部分。我想你没听说过它，因为它的总部在德国，那也是我出生的地方。"

Shinji blinked several times, not guessing that she was a foreigner, Sure, they red hair was a little strange for someone of Japanese birth, but it wasn't unheard of.

碇真嗣眨了几次眼，没想到她是个外国人。确实，她那头红发对于一个日本人来说有些奇怪，但也不是闻所未闻。

"I didn't even notice," said Shinji to himself.

"我都没注意到," 真嗣自言自语道。

"Notice what?" asked Asuka quickly.

"注意到什么？" 明日香迅速问道。

"No...just that, your Japanese seems flawless, so I didn't even consider the fact that you were foreign."

"不...只是，你的日语听起来毫无瑕疵，所以我都没考虑到你其实是外国人。"

"Hmph, well I took several Japanese classes in college so its natural for me to be well versed in the language."

"哼，我在大学里学过几门日语课，所以精通这门语言是理所当然的。"

Asuka didn't bother to add that she hadn't mastered all the Kanji yet.

明日香没有提及她还没有完全掌握所有的汉字。

"So this company conducted this experiment which led to Second Impact?" asked Shinji.

"所以这家公司进行了这个实验，导致了第二次冲击？" 真嗣问道。

"Yeah," nodded Asuka. "My involvement is rather minimal though up until two years ago."

“嗯，”明日香点头道，“不过直到两年前，我的参与程度都很低。”

"Why? What happened?" “为什么？发生了什么？”

There was a pause in Asuka's voice for several seconds here. Two years ago she had been approached by Nerv, now the successor to Gehirn and had learned that her mother had once worked for the company. Immediately she began doing tests of all sorts preparing her for becoming an Eva pilot. But telling all that to Shinji wasn't necessary.

明日香的声音在这里停顿了几秒钟。两年前，她被 NERV——现在的 GEHIRN 继任者——找上门，得知她的母亲曾为该公司工作。随即，她开始接受各种测试，为成为 EVA 驾驶员做准备。但这些事没必要全部告诉真嗣。

"I was asked to come onboard the project because of my thesis I wrote on quantum mechanics and the way the human brain processes thought patterns. I was needed for research so I helped them run some tests. This," said Asuka as she tugged at the plug suit. "It measures human brain waves and thought patterns. I helped develop it."

"我被邀请参与这个项目，是因为我写的关于量子力学以及人类大脑处理思维模式的论文。他们需要我来进行研究，所以我帮他们进行了一些测试。这个，" 明日香说着，拉了拉紧身衣上的插头。"它能测量人类的大脑波和思维模式。我参与了它的研发。"

Shinji was becoming more and more impressed with her, but a few things still hadn't been addressed yet.

真嗣对她的印象越来越深刻，但还有几件事尚未提及。

"What is the orange colored fluid then?"

“那么，橙色的液体是什么？”

"That? Its called LCL fluid. The plug suit and LCL fluid work in conjunction with each other. They place the test subject in a cylinder and pump it full of LCL fluid while they wear the plug suit."

“那个？它叫做 LCL 液体。插头服和 LCL 液体是相互配合的。他们将测试对象放入一个圆柱体内，并在他们穿着插头服的同时注入 LCL 液体。”

"Don't they drown?" asked Shinji.

"他们不会淹死吗？" 真嗣问道。

"No...theres some compound in the LCL fluid which enables oxygen to pass through a humans body almost as though they were breathing. You can drink the stuff as well of course."

不...LCL 液体中含有某种化合物，能让氧气几乎像呼吸一样透过人体。当然，你也可以饮用它。

As Asuka finished talking, Shinji's head was filled with more questions still then answers. She was different, that much was certain. But everything almost seemed...to perfect.

当明日香说完话，真嗣的脑海中疑问依旧比答案多。她确实不同了，这一点毋庸置疑。但一切似乎都...太过完美了。

"You mentioned Second Impact earlier," said Shinji. "Are we experiencing something like that right now?"

“你之前提到了第二次冲击，”真嗣说道，“我们现在是不是正在经历类似的事情？”

Asuka was rather surprised at this question, thinking that Shinji wasn't quite as dumb as he looked.

明日香对这个问题的提出颇感惊讶，心想真嗣并不像他看起来那么笨。

"Third Impact," said Asuka softly. "This is likely what has happened."

"第三次冲击," 明日香轻声说道。"这很可能就是已经发生的事情。"

"Third Impact?" asked Shinji feeling confused.

"第三次冲击？" 真嗣感到困惑地问。"

"Its just something that could theoretically happen, though now that I see it for myself, it is rather shocking."

"这只是一个理论上可能发生的事情，不过现在亲眼目睹，确实相当震撼。"

"What is it though?" "那是什么东西？"

"I don't know," Asuka lied.

"我不知道，" 明日香撒谎道。

She knew what Third Impact was of course, but she wasn't about to tell Shinji the details. If Third Impact had actually happened though, why was she still alive? She could only summarize that something else must have happened instead.

她当然知道第三次冲击是什么，但她不打算告诉真治细节。如果第三次冲击真的发生了，那她为什么还活着？她只能总结说，一定发生了其他事情。

"So, we are probably the only people in the city?" asked Shinji.

"这么说，我们可能是城里仅有的人了？" 真嗣问道。

"Probably," shrugged Asuka. "I'd imagine there isn't anybody for several hundred miles though."

"大概吧，" 明日香耸了耸肩。"我想方圆几百英里内都不会有人了。

'As I thought.' sighed Shinji inside his mind.

“正如我所料。” 真嗣在心中叹息道。

They both lapsed into silence, both staring out at the ocean waves as they crashed unto the shore of Tokyo-3. Shinji was still thinking things over after what Asuka had told him. Second Impact was something only the history books told about, and that was very briefly glossed over, which now seemed to be purposefully done. Third Impact was an entirely other thing though. What could have caused it though? Another experiment? Was it something to do with nuclear warfare? Asuka was part of some company that seemed to research the human brain, so that might be part of it. Shinji however was pulled away from his train of thought as Asuka spoke.

两人都陷入了沉默，目光凝视着东京-3 海岸边汹涌的海浪。真嗣在听了明日香的话后，仍在反复思考。第二次冲击只在历史书中有所提及，而且只是简略带过，现在看来似乎是有意为之。第三次冲击则是另一回事。究竟是什么引起的呢？是另一次实验吗？还是与核战争有关？明日香所属的公司似乎在研究人脑，这可能是其中的一部分。然而，当明日香开口时，真嗣的思绪被打断了。

"Well, I told you about myself, now its your turn."

“好吧，我告诉了你我的事，现在轮到你了。”

"Huh?" said Shinji, not quite hearing her the first time.

"啊？" 真嗣第一次没太听清她的话。

"Tell my about yourself idiot!"

"给我讲讲你自己，白痴！"

'You could have phrased that differently,' thought Shinji.

'你本可以换个说法的，' 真嗣心想。

"Well, not much to say about myself. I've only been here in Tokyo-3 for a few weeks since this whole thing happened, and-"

"嗯，关于我自己也没什么好说的。自从这一切发生后，我只在这里的东京-3 待了几周，而且——"

"I'm already bored," sighed Asuka as she turned away from Shinji and made to lay down.

"我已经无聊了，"明日香叹了口气，转身离开真嗣，准备躺下。

Shinji was left with his mouth open for several minutes looking at Asuka's back before he closed it slowly.

真嗣张着嘴愣了几分钟，盯着明日香的背影，然后慢慢地合上了嘴。

'She purposefully did that,' thought Shinji as he took a sip of water. Well, even if he didn't say anything about himself, he did at least learn a few things about Asuka.

'她故意那么做的，' 真嗣想着，喝了一口水。好吧，即使他没有提及自己，至少他对明日香有了一些了解。

It was later in the day, and Shinji was returning from the city where he had been searching for more supplies. The market he had been visiting was slowly being deprived of its food, and Shinji was just starting to look for other places to scavenge. Surprisingly, during his search he found a car that seemed to be laden with supplies. The people who had once occupied the car seemed to be going on a camping trip. Whatever there intentions were, Shinji was just glad that they had packed enough canned food in the car to last several days. Among the food, he found a camping backpack, a pot and saucepan, and two packages of plastic forks. The only thing he wished he would have found was another sleeping bag, as sleeping on the beach was starting to take its toll on his back.

那天晚些时候，真嗣从城市回来，他在那里寻找更多的补给。他常去的那个市场食物逐渐匮乏，真嗣开始寻找其他地方搜刮。出乎意料的是，他在搜索中发现了一辆似乎装满物资的汽车。那些曾经占据汽车的人似乎要去露营。无论他们的意图是什么，真嗣很高兴他们准备了足够多的罐头食品，足够维持好几天。在食物中，他找到了一个露营背包、一个锅和煎锅，以及两包塑料叉子。他唯一希望找到的是另一个睡袋，因为睡在海滩上开始对他的背部造成影响。

Sliding down the slope, Shinji jogged the rest of the way towards the fire, the backpack shaking with each step. Whether this woke Asuka up, or if she was just resting, she heard it either way, and tilted her head upwards to look at Shinji.

滑下斜坡，真嗣一路小跑向火堆，背包随着每一步晃动。不知是这动静吵醒了明日香，还是她只是在休息，总之她听见了声响，便抬起头来看向真嗣。

"What the hell is that?" she asked the moment he placed the backpack beside the fire.

"那是什么鬼东西？" 他刚把背包放在火堆旁，她就问道。

"A camping backpack," replied Shinji as he wiped his forehead with the sleeve of his shirt.

"露营背包，" 真嗣回答着，用衬衫袖子擦了擦额头。

"How does that help?" retorted Asuka.

"那有什么用？" 明日香反驳道。

'Shut up for a minute and I'll tell you,' thought Shinji as he started unloading stuff.

“安静一会儿，我这就告诉你，”真嗣边想边开始卸货。

Asuka watched him silently as he removed the plastic forks, the pot and pan, and then the canned food. Upon seeing these last items, Asuka let out a derisive snort and said-

明日香默默地看着他，他先是拿出了塑料叉子、锅和煎锅，然后是罐头食品。看到这些罐头，明日香发出了一声嘲讽的哼声，说道——

"Canned food?" “罐头食品？”

"Would you rather continue to eat candy bars and bags of chips?"

"你宁愿继续吃糖果和薯片吗？"

Asuka ignored him and said, "You can't eat this by just opening it. Whats more, do you even have a means of opening this?"

明日香无视他，说道：“你不能光打开它就吃。再说了，你有打开它的工具吗？”

Shinji dug around inside the backpack and retrieved a can opener in reply to Asuka.

真嗣在背包里翻找了一番，拿出一个开罐器回应明日香。

"Anything else you want to complain about?"

“还有什么想抱怨的吗？”

'Yeah, why am I stuck here with you,' thought Asuka.

“是啊，为什么我非得和你困在这里，”明日香心想。

She turned her head away from Shinji then, and curled back under the sleeping bag.

她随即转过头去不再看真嗣，蜷缩回睡袋里。

Shinji meanwhile starting going over the canned food he had found and organizing it. Each of them was well within the expiration date range, so he wasn't worried about that. He was going to make this last as long as possible though. The food itself was unusual for camping trips, since none of the normal was there, like ramen for instance, but Shinji thought that he could work with what he had.

与此同时，真嗣开始整理他找到的罐头食品。每个罐头的保质期都在合理范围内，所以他并不担心这一点。他打算尽可能延长这些食物的使用时间。这些食物对于露营旅行来说有些不寻常，因为没有常见的那些，比如拉面，但真嗣认为他可以利用现有的资源。

Grabbing the pot, he walked over to the ocean of Tokyo-3 and filled it half full with the strange LCL fluid.

他拿起锅，走到东京-3 的海洋边，用那奇怪的 LCL 液体装满了半锅。

'Well, I can drink it,' thought Shinji, 'and even there is anything harmful in there, boiling it should get rid of it.'

“好吧，我可以喝它，”真嗣想，“即使里面有什么有害物质，煮沸应该能去除它们。”

Taking the pot back to the fire, he quickly ran into a problem. He didn't have a way to suspend the pot over the fire evenly. He himself could have dealt with the the food being on the slightly more crispy side, but he had a feeling Asuka wouldn't stand for it.

他将锅子拿回火堆旁，很快遇到了一个问题。他没有方法将锅均匀地悬挂在火上。他自己倒是可以忍受食物稍微焦脆一些，但他觉得明日香肯定不会接受。

Deciding on his course, he grabbed several of the smaller pieces of fire wood, and dug them down into the sand on either side of the fire. Wishing more than anything that he had a knife right now. He quickly looked around the beach within the fires radius for a particularly pointed rock. After finding one, he returned to the fire and started gouging out the wood in the center of the sticks.

决定好方案后，他抓起几根较小的柴火，将它们插进火堆两侧的沙子里。此刻他无比希望手边有一把刀。他迅速环顾火光范围内的海滩，寻找一块特别尖锐的石头。找到后，他回到火堆旁，开始用石头在木棍中心挖出凹槽。

During this, Asuka turned around briefly and watched for a few seconds as Shinji struggled at making do with the jagged rock. Laughing internally at him for a moment, she turned back around and slept calmly.

在此期间，明日香短暂地转过身来，观察了真嗣用锯齿状石头勉强操作的几秒钟。她内心暗笑了一会儿，然后转回身去，平静地入睡了。

Shinji didn't gave an indication that he noticed this, as he was too absorbed in his work. After almost forty-five minutes of this, Shinji had both the stick to where he roughly wanted them. Finding a rather long piece of wood, he tested its strength by pick of the pot by the handle with it before determining it worthy. Placing the stick atop the other two, the ends fell into the groves he had hollowed out by the rock. At first, he held onto both ends of the stick, afraid that it might suddenly snap, but it seemed to be able to hold the pot above the flames. Thankfully, the fire had died down since he had last stacked wood on it, so there wasn't any danger in the stick breaking from the fire.

真嗣并未表现出他注意到了这一点，因为他正全神贯注于工作。经过近四十五分钟的努力，真嗣终于将木棍调整到了大致理想的位置。他找到一根较长的木头，通过用它挑起锅柄来测试其强度，确认其足够结实后，便将这根木棍架在另外两根之上，木棍两端恰好嵌入他用岩石凿出的凹槽中。起初，他紧握木棍两端，担心它会突然断裂，但似乎它能稳稳地托起锅，悬于火焰之上。幸运的是，自上次添柴后火势已减弱，因此木棍因火而折断的风险也大大降低。

With the water starting to boil, Shinji now looked towards the canned food. He wasn't a fan of canned rice, but it was either that or starve he supposed. Dumping the entire contents of the rice into the pot, he then grabbed the can of chicken broth beside him and opened it, slowly pouring some of it into the pot. He was more careful with this, as there was only one can, whereas he had several of the rice.

随着水开始沸腾，真嗣将目光转向罐装食品。他并不喜欢罐装米饭，但想来除了吃这个，就只能饿肚子了。他将整罐米饭倒入锅中，随后拿起手边的鸡汤罐头，打开后缓缓倒入一些进锅。他对此更为小心，因为鸡汤只有一罐，而米饭他还有好几罐。

Placing the lid over the pot, he let it cook for fifteen minutes, before opening the lid and tasting it.

盖上锅盖，他让菜炖了十五分钟，然后打开盖子尝了尝。

'Some salt and garlic wouldn't hurt,' thought Shinji, wishing that he had access to such ingredients.

'加点盐和蒜应该不错，' 真嗣心想，希望自己能拿到这些调料。

Looking at the rest of the canned food, he was tempted to cook some corn to go with the rice, but not being able to cook it in the sauce pan was a problem. Well, maybe next time he could just toss everything together. If Asuka was going to be picky about even that, then she could cook her own food.

看着剩下的罐头食品，他很想煮些玉米配米饭，但无法在平底锅里烹饪是个问题。嗯，也许下次他可以把所有东西都混在一起。如果明日香连这也挑剔，那她可以自己做饭。

'Like that would happen,' thought Shinji.

'像那样的事才不会发生呢，' 真嗣心想。

Taking the pot off the fire, he let it cool for a few minutes before he decide it was time to wake Asuka up. Though it seemed there relationship had improved, he still wasn't keen on taking chances in case she was awake. Walking in a wide arc along where she lay, he came around to the other side where her face was turned.

他将锅从火上取下，让它冷却了几分钟，然后决定是时候叫醒明日香了。虽然他们的关系似乎有所改善，但他仍然不愿冒险，以防她已经醒了。他沿着她躺着的地方绕了一个大圈，来到她的脸转向的另一侧。

"Huh...she is asleep," mumbled Shinji aloud.

“呃...她还在睡，”真嗣自言自语道。

Asuka was curled up under the sleep, her face just poking through. Most of her complexion had returned so she wasn't pasty white like when Shinji had found her near death. Shinji hadn't asked her about that, nor did he think he'd ever ask her, and he didn't think she'd tell him anyway. Her lips were pink from the cold as were her cheeks.

明日香蜷缩在被子下，脸庞微微露出。她的肤色大部分已经恢复，不再是真嗣发现她濒死时的苍白。真嗣没有问她那件事，也不认为他会问，而且他觉得她也不会告诉他。她的嘴唇和脸颊因寒冷而泛着粉红色。

'She must not be able to deal with the cold as well as me,' thought Shinji briefly as he watched her sleep. Though next second, he berated himself, knowing that if she caught him watching her like this, it'd be the death of him.

“她肯定不如我耐寒，”真嗣短暂地想道，同时注视着她的睡颜。但下一秒，他就责备自己，知道如果她发现自己这样盯着她，那他可就死定了。

Crouching down next to her, he placed his hand against her shoulder, and nudged her gently. At first, she didn't budge, but after several more times of nudging her, Asuka started to stir. Her eyes first opened slowly, and the first thing they saw were Shinji. Shinji saw this as well and was about to take a step back when Asuka closed her eyes again.

他蹲在她旁边，把手放在她的肩膀上，轻轻地推了推她。起初，她没有反应，但在几次轻推之后，明日香开始动了。她的眼睛先是慢慢睁开，第一眼看到的就是真嗣。真嗣也看到了这一幕，正要后退一步时，明日香又闭上了眼睛。

'What was that?' wondered Shinji.

'那是什么？' 真嗣疑惑道。

He paused in place for several seconds, before he took a step towards her.

他在原地停顿了几秒钟，然后向她迈出了一步。

"Asuka?" “明日香？”

"What," she groaned back. "If you didn't wake me up for a good reason, I'm gonna kill you..."

"什么，"她呻吟着回应。"如果你不是为了个好理由叫醒我，我就要杀了你……"

'By what? Crawling after me?' thought Shinji.

'用什么？爬着追我吗？' 真嗣心想。

"I made food," he said simply.

"我做了饭，"他简单地说道。

At this, she opened her eyes again, and though Shinji didn't want to admit it, she was rather cute as she did this.

听到这话，她又睁开了眼睛，虽然真嗣不想承认，但她这样做确实相当可爱。

"What did you make?" “你做了什么？”

"Some rice with chicken broth?"

“一些鸡汤泡饭？”

"Thats it?" “就这？”

"Were you expecting a five course meal?"

“你还期待着五道菜的大餐吗？”

Asuka shut up after that, and slowly sat up, letting the sleeping bag fall from her body. She yawned with a hand covering her mouth, and stretched her arms up in the air. She must have been been feeling better, as she even tried standing up, which brought a grin to Shinji's face. But the grin dropped as Asuka shot him a death glare.

自那之后，明日香安静了下来，缓缓坐起身，让睡袋从身上滑落。她用手遮住嘴巴打了个哈欠，然后伸直双臂向上伸展。她一定感觉好多了，甚至尝试站起来，这让真嗣的脸上露出了微笑。但当明日香向他投来死亡凝视时，笑容瞬间消失了。

"So, where is it?" “那么，它在哪儿？”

"Right here," said Shinji as he held the pot out for her.

“就在这儿，”真嗣说着，将锅递给她。

She looked at it for several seconds before she asked, "You didn't do anything to this did you?"

她盯着它看了好几秒，然后问道：“你没对这东西做什么吧？”

"Just eat it..." sighed Shinji, clearly getting annoyed with her constant complaining.

“就吃吧……”真嗣叹了口气，显然对她没完没了的抱怨感到不耐烦。

Asuka looked at him one final time before she raised the pot and fork to her lips and took a small bite of the rice. She chewed slowly, surprised at the flavor and tenderness of the rice.

明日香最后看了他一眼，然后举起锅和叉子送到嘴边，小心翼翼地吃了一小口米饭。她慢慢地咀嚼着，对米饭的味道和柔软感到惊讶。

"Well?" asked Shinji. “嗯？” 真嗣问道。

Asuka's head turned towards him, her hair wiping around in a mad flurry, and Shinji thought that she was about to complain until she said-

明日香的头转向他，发丝在狂乱中飞舞，真嗣以为她又要抱怨，直到她开口说道——

"Its not bad actually." She said this as though she had assumed it would have been inedible.

“其实还不错。” 她说这话时，仿佛她原本以为这会难以下咽。

"You like it?" “你喜欢吗？”

"I wouldn't say I like it or dislike. It certainly needs a few things, and white rice with chicken broth isn't something I'd ever considered mixing before...but I guess it works."

“我不敢说喜欢或不喜欢。它确实需要一些改进，而且白米饭配鸡汤这种搭配，我以前从未想过……但我想它还算行。”

Shinji was rather surprised at her tone as she said this, it was almost as though she was evaluating it as someone who knows how to cook would.

真嗣对她说话的语气感到相当惊讶，那语气几乎就像是一个懂得烹饪的人在评价一样。

"You act as though you cook yourself."

“你表现得好像你自己也会做饭似的。”

"Oh, I do, though I haven't in a while. While I was in college, I mostly cooked for myself instead of eating the cafeteria food."

“哦，我确实会，虽然有一阵子没做了。上大学的时候，我大多是自己做饭，而不是吃食堂的饭菜。”

Asuka turned towards Shinji and saw that he was smiling slightly. Guessing what he was smiling about however, he quickly said-

明日香转向真嗣，发现他正微微一笑。猜到他在笑什么，她迅速说道——

"Well, I haven't cooked in a while though, so don't expect it to happen."

“好吧，我有一阵子没做饭了，所以别指望能有多好。”

'I should have guessed,' thought Shinji as the smile slid from his face, but Asuka seemed to be in a better mood now.

“我早该猜到的，”真嗣心想，笑容从脸上消失，但明日香现在似乎心情好多了。

After finishing her portion she passed the pot to Shinji, though she kept her fork. Shinji didn't need Asuka's explanation of what that meant.

吃完自己的份后，她把锅递给了真嗣，但叉子仍握在手中。真嗣不需要明日香解释这意味着什么。

After finishing his own portion, Shinji went to the sea and washed the pot clean, preparing it for tomorrows meal. Walking back, he placed the clean pot beside the rest of the canned goods and sat on his side of the fire.

吃完自己的份后，真嗣走到海边把锅洗干净，为明天的餐食做准备。走回来时，他把干净的锅放在罐头食品旁边，坐在火堆的另一侧。

'That could have been worse I suppose,' thought Shinji as he leaned backwards, looking up at the sky which had started turning crimson as the sun set.

“我想这还不算太糟。”真嗣向后靠去，仰望着天空，太阳落山时天空已染上了深红色。

Across the fire from him, Asuka had her face resting in her hands as she gazed into the fire. Eventually her gaze was brought upwards as she looked at Shinji leaning backwards and looking up at the sky. She frowned for several seconds, until Shinji's eyes darted away from the sky and turned back towards the fire. Though Asuka tried averting her eyes from him, Shinji still caught her.

在火堆的对面，明日香将脸埋在双手中，凝视着火焰。最终，她的目光上移，看向了向后仰头望天的真嗣。她皱眉了几秒钟，直到真嗣的视线从天空移开，转回火堆。尽管明日香试图避开他的目光，真嗣还是捕捉到了她的视线。

"What?" he asked rather simply, not bothering to allude to the fact that he had caught her watching him.

“怎么了？”他相当简单地问道，并没有暗示他注意到她在看他。

Asuka took several seconds to reply though, not wanting to look him directly in the eye. She wasn't embarrassed, rather, she was just angry at herself for looking at him in the first place.

明日香花了好几秒才回答，不想直接看他的眼睛。她并不感到尴尬，相反，她只是对自己一开始就看着他感到生气。

"What brought you to Tokyo-3?"

"是什么让你来到第三新东京市的？"

"What brought me to Tokyo-3?" repeated Shinji.

"是什么让我来到第三新东京市的？" 真嗣重复道。

"Just answer the question," sighed Asuka as she turned her head back towards him.

"直接回答问题，" 明日香叹了口气，将头转回面向他。

"Well," started Shinji, "my father did I suppose..."

“嗯，”真嗣开口道，“我想我父亲确实……”

"You're father?" replied Asuka rather surprised.

“你父亲？”明日香有些惊讶地反问道。

Shinji hesitated here, not keen on the subject. Asuka however noticed this sudden reluctance to the question and assumed that it had to do with his father.

真嗣在这里犹豫了，对这个话题并不热衷。然而，明日香注意到了他突然的迟疑，并猜测这与他父亲有关。

'Hmmm...so he doesn't like his father much?' thought Asuka.

'嗯...这么说，他不太喜欢他父亲？' 明日香心想。

"What does your father have to do with you being here?"

“你父亲和你在这里有什么关系？”

Shinji didn't answer for several minutes, and Asuka was almost ready to give up when he finally replied.

真嗣沉默了几分钟，就在明日香几乎要放弃时，他终于回答了。

"I'm not sure what he wanted from me by being here. But he's shuffled me around from place to place ever since my mother died."

"我不确定他在这里想从我这里得到什么。但从我母亲去世后，他就一直把我从这个地方挪到那个地方。"

"You're mother is dead?" asked Asuka, perking up slightly.

"你母亲去世了？" 明日香微微抬起头问道。

"Yeah, she died when I was young, so I don't really remember her. Her name was Yui. Anyways, my father moved me around every few months so I never stayed in one place very long. School was never fun since I never got to know anybody very closely, and eventually I just started not caring since I'd be leaving eventually."

“是的，她在我很小的时候就去世了，所以我其实不太记得她了。她的名字叫优。总之，我父亲每隔几个月就带我搬家，所以我从没在一个地方待很久。上学从来都不好玩，因为我从没机会和任何人深入了解，久而久之，我也就不再在意了，反正迟早要离开。”

Shinji was rather surprised how easily he was able to talk about these things with Asuka, seeing as how he had never mentioned this to anybody before.

真嗣颇为惊讶，自己居然能如此轻易地和明日香谈论这些事情，毕竟他以前从未向任何人提起过。

"About three weeks ago, my father had me move here, to Tokyo-3 and I roomed with a guy who was looking for a roommate."

“大约三周前，我父亲让我搬到这里，东京-3，和一个正在找室友的家伙合租。”

"How long ago was that?" asked Asuka.

“那是多久以前的事了？”明日香问道。

"Two and a half weeks maybe since I moved in."

"大概两周半吧，自从我搬进来之后。"

"Is that taking into account the days since this all happened," said Asuka as she waved her hand towards the sea of Tokyo-3.

"你是指从这一切发生以来的天数吗？" 明日香说着，挥手向着东京-3 的海洋。

"I didn't even think of that," replied Shinji.

"我都没考虑到这个，" 真嗣回答道。

How many days had it been since he had even woken up on this beach? He wasn't even sure anymore.

自从他上次在这片海滩上醒来已经过去多少天了？他甚至都不太确定了。

"A week, maybe more," said Shinji.

“大概一周，或许更久，”真嗣说道。

Asuka thought about this for a moment. A week sounded about right.

明日香想了一会儿。一周听起来差不多。

"So three, maybe four weeks," she murmured as she bit her lip.

“大概三到四周吧，”她轻声说道，咬了咬嘴唇。

Shinji looked at her for several seconds before he asked, "How long have you been here Asuka?"

真嗣盯着她看了几秒钟，然后问道：“你在这里多久了，明日香？”

"Before this? A week I'd say," she said as she continued looking into the fire.

“在这之前？大概一周吧，”她一边说一边继续凝视着火光。

Asuka thought about the time difference. If Shinji had arrived here in Tokyo-3 four or three weeks ago, and she had arrived here two weeks ago, then whatever happened to cause this would surely have been taking affect during both there times here. But there was no alert of that, nothing to indicate anything had happened at the point. She could clearly remember visiting the facility and running the tests on Eva Unit 02. There was no indication that the Angels would have attacked this soon though. Whats more, where was she during all this? Why did it still feel like a large chunk of her memory was gone?

明日香考虑着时差。如果真嗣四或三周前到达了第三新东京市，而她是两周前到达的，那么导致这一切发生的事件肯定在他们两人在此期间都有所影响。但没有任何警报，没有任何迹象表明发生了什么。她清楚地记得参观设施并对 EVA 二号机进行测试。尽管如此，没有迹象表明使徒会这么快发动攻击。更重要的是，这段时间她在哪里？为什么她仍然感觉自己的记忆缺失了一大块？

Asuka held her head in her hands as she thought this, but nothing about it made any sense.

明日香双手抱头思考着，但这一切毫无逻辑可言。

"My father was about to send me to somebody else's place the day before this all happened I remember though," continued Shinji, unaware of Asuka's lapse in the conversation. "Though I don't remember who that person was."

“我记得，就在这一切发生的前一天，我父亲原本打算把我送到别人家里，”真嗣继续说道，没有察觉到明日香在对话中的走神。“虽然我不记得那个人是谁了。”

'Would you shut up already,' thought Asuka as she held her hands over her face.

“你能不能闭嘴啊，”明日香心里想着，双手捂住了脸。

"After my mother died, my father seemed to become obsessed with his work though...I think thats why he sent me away, because he didn't have time for me. I don't know why he would have wanted me back though..."

"母亲去世后，父亲似乎对工作变得痴迷起来...我想这就是他送我离开的原因，因为他没有时间照顾我。但我不明白他为何又想让我回来..."

Shinji sat like that for a while, trying to remember what his father had told him the day he was supposed to leave for Tokyo-3. Wasn't it something to do with work? Why couldn't he remember? His father was so focused on what he did at the company that he owned, that he never had time to spend with his Shinji. He had never received birthday presents or cake. Every Christmas was the same; he always just got a card and the occasional phone call, but nothing significant.

碇真嗣就那样坐了一会儿，试图回忆起父亲在他动身前往第三新东京市那天告诉他的话。是不是和工作有关？为什么他记不起来？他的父亲全神贯注于自己公司的业务，以至于从未有时间陪伴真嗣。他从未收到过生日礼物或蛋糕。每个圣诞节都如出一辙；他总是只收到一张卡片和偶尔的电话问候，却没有任何实质性的关怀。

Shinji remembered again why he despised his father. For all the shuffling around he had to endure through the years, for never knowing what had happened to his mother. Sometimes he wondered if his mother hadn't died at the hands of his father...even if it was by accident.

真嗣再次想起了他为何憎恨自己的父亲。多年来他不得不忍受的种种变故，以及从未知晓母亲的下落。有时他甚至怀疑，母亲是否就是被父亲所害……即便那可能只是个意外。

Where was his father though if he was alive? Was he holed up in some bunker? That seemed the most likely place he would be if he was alive. Maybe other people had found similar shelter. Shinji had heard about bunkers being placed all over Tokyo-3, and even that the large skyscrapers were able to retract into the ground, and that some underground complex protected them-

如果父亲还活着，他又会在哪里呢？是不是躲在某个掩体里？如果他还活着，这似乎是最有可能的藏身之处。或许其他人也找到了类似的避难所。真嗣听说过东京-3 各地都设有掩体，甚至那些高耸的摩天大楼也能缩入地下，还有某些地下设施在保护着他们——

'Nerv,' thought Shinji suddenly. 'Thats right...thats where my father worked...is the director for that matter...or was I suppose.'

'NERV，' 真嗣突然想到。'对了...那就是父亲工作的地方...或者说，他是那里的指挥官...或者说，曾经是吧。'

Shinji stood up then, and stretched, looking up at the sky as he did so. It was slowly becoming darker now.

真嗣随即站起身来，伸了个懒腰，抬头望向天空。天色正逐渐暗下来。

Turning his gaze to Asuka, he saw that she was still looking into the fire. He was wondering what she was thinking about, since she had spoken a word for several minutes now.

他将目光转向明日香，只见她仍在凝视着火堆。他在想她此刻在想些什么，因为她已经好几分钟没说话了。

"Hey...Asu-" “嘿...明日香-”

"Shut Up! You're annoying." she replied abruptly.

"闭嘴！你真烦人。" 她突然回答道。

Shinji was rather taken aback, but replied cooly, "If you wanted to be left alone, you could have just said so."

真嗣有些吃惊，但冷静地回应道："如果你想要独处，直说就好了。"

"I want you to shut the fuck up is what I want you to do," snarled Asuka as her gaze darted up to him.

"我要你他妈的闭嘴，这就是我想让你做的，" 明日香咆哮着，目光猛地转向他。

"Fine," shrugged Shinji. He was too used to her behavior to give a damn about it anymore.

"好吧，" 真嗣耸了耸肩。他已经习惯了她的行为，不再对此感到在意。

Figuring that now would be a good time to take a walk, Shinji grabbed one of the water bottles beside the fire and decided to walk up the beach a ways. He hadn't been up very far, as the city was always the more promising when it came to supplies. But since they had enough for several days, he could take it easy for a bit.

真嗣觉得现在是散步的好时机，他拿起火堆旁的一瓶水，决定沿着海滩走一段。他之前并没有走得太远，因为城市总是更容易找到补给。但由于他们现在有足够几天的物资，他可以稍微放松一下。

"I'll be back later," said Shinji as he started walking away from the fire.

"我一会儿就回来，" 真嗣说着，开始远离火堆。

Asuka didn't even give him a second glance.

明日香连看都没看他第二眼。

Shinji was away long after the sun had already set. He wasn't sure how long he walked for, but then again, he had a lot on his mind. He had forgotten about his father until Asuka had brought it up, and though he wasn't pleased about remembering such times, he couldn't deny the fact that he was curious to know whether his father was alive or dead. Either way though, he couldn't do anything about it in his current state.

太阳早已落山，真嗣却仍未归来。他不确定自己走了多久，但话说回来，他脑子里装了太多事情。直到明日香提起，他才想起自己的父亲，尽管回忆起那些时光并不愉快，但他无法否认自己对父亲是生是死感到好奇。不过无论如何，以他目前的状态，对此也无能为力。

Finally getting back to the fire, he saw that it had steadily died down so only embers remained. In front of it, Asuka was still sitting with her head resting in her hands. Shinji couldn't help but laugh slightly since she hadn't moved an inch since he had left, but as he got closer, he noticed that she had fallen asleep. Pausing for a second, he eventually grabbed the sleeping bag beside her, and made to place it around her shoulders. Almost immediately, upon touching her shoulder with the edge of the blanket, Asuka's eyes opened, and her defenses kicked in. She immediately grabbed Shinji's wrist with her left hand and twisted it before pushing her full weight against his chest with her shoulder so that he tumbled backwards. She seemed to have become used to not moving her legs, because she spun around like a top and placed her right hand on his neck, poised to break it.

终于回到篝火旁，他发现火已渐渐熄灭，只剩下一堆余烬。火堆前，明日香依旧坐在那里，头埋在双手中。真嗣忍不住轻笑，因为她自他离开后便一动未动，但当他走近时，注意到她已经睡着了。他停顿了一下，最终拿起她身旁的睡袋，准备披在她肩上。就在他用毯子边缘触碰到她肩膀的瞬间，明日香的眼睛猛地睁开，防御本能立刻启动。她迅速用左手抓住真嗣的手腕，扭动后以全身重量猛推他的胸口，使他向后跌倒。她似乎已经习惯了不动腿，像陀螺一样旋转，右手随即按在他的脖子上，准备施力折断。

For one wild instance, Shinji thought that she had returned to the girl who he had first met on the beach who was ready to kill him, but Shinji saw the flicker in her eyes as she realized that it was him. Slowly, Asuka released her grip on his throat and then released her hand from his wrist. She seemed to be slowly gathering what was happening, though the anger still didn't leave her eyes.

有那么一瞬间，真嗣以为她变回了当初在海滩上初次相遇时那个准备置他于死地的女孩，但当她意识到是他时，眼中闪过了一丝动摇。渐渐地，明日香松开了掐住他喉咙的手，随后也从他的手腕上放开了。她似乎在慢慢理清眼前的情况，尽管眼中的怒火并未消散。

Pushing himself upright, Shinji looked back at her for a second before he sighed and said, "Do you really think someone other than myself is here?"

挣扎着坐起身，真嗣回头看了她一眼，随即叹了口气，说道：“你真的认为除了我之外还有别人在这里吗？”

Shinji didn't know the meaning of his words, but they certainly affected Asuka, who was reminded of ghosts from her past.

真嗣并不明白自己话语的含义，但它们无疑触动了明日香，让她想起了过去的幽灵。

She spun around and ignored him, anger flaring up within her.

她转过身去，无视他，怒火在心中升腾。

Shinji watched her for a moment longer before he stood up and walked around to his side of the fire while mumbling quietly, "Sorry would have been nice."

真嗣又看了她一会儿，然后站起来，绕到火堆的另一边，小声嘀咕着："要是道歉就好了。"

"I'm not sorry for anything," said Asuka without lowering her voice.

"我没什么好道歉的，"明日香没有降低声音说道。

'At least you're still talking,' thought Shinji as he sat down.

"'至少你还在说话，' 真嗣坐下时心想。

Piling more wood on the fire, he built it higher until it had returned to its former blazing glory. Turning towards Asuka he asked, "So? Why were you so focused earlier that you fell asleep sitting up?"

他又往火堆里添了些木柴，将其堆高直至恢复了先前的熊熊烈焰。转身面向明日香，他问道：“那么？你之前为何如此专注，以至于坐着就睡着了？”

Shinji wasn't sure, but he thought he saw Asuka's cheeks redden slightly at his words, though it may have just been from the heat of the fire.

真嗣不确定，但他觉得明日香的脸颊在他话音刚落时微微泛红，尽管那可能只是火光的炙烤所致。

Asuka debated whether to tell him or not, but didn't see any reason why she shouldn't.

明日香犹豫着是否要告诉他，但没觉得有什么理由不该说。

"I was thinking about the time between when you arrived here in Tokyo-3 and when I arrived. It doesn't make sense. Whatever caused...this...Third Impact, must have been happening while we were in the city. I was never told of anything though, and even if it was predicted to happen, there would have been means for us to stop it."

我在想你抵达第三新东京市和我到达之间的时间。这说不通。无论引发……这……第三次冲击的原因是什么，肯定是在我们在城里的时候发生的。但我从未被告知任何事情，即使它被预见到会发生，也应该有办法阻止它。

"You act like Tokyo-3 was the epicenter of it all."

“你表现得好像东京-3 是这一切的中心。”

"I'm sure that most of the cities on earth like a lot like this as well, but I'm positive that Tokyo-3 was the epicenter."

“我敢肯定地球上大多数城市都和这里很像，但我确信东京-3 是中心。”

"What makes you say that?"

“你为什么这么说？”

"I have my reasons," said Asuka with an air of superiority. In truth, she couldn't be positive that Tokyo-3 was where it had happened, but judging how importantly a role the city played in the defense against the Angels, there couldn't be any other possibility.

"我有我的理由，" 明日香带着一种优越感说道。实际上，她并不能完全确定第三新东京市就是事情发生的地方，但考虑到这座城市在对抗使徒中的重要角色，不可能有其他可能性。

"So...you're saying there must have been some indication to Third Impact in the days leading up to it?"

"那么...你是说在第三次冲击发生前的日子里，一定有一些迹象预示着它？"

"Yeah, but judging by what you told me, and what I already know, nothing seemed different."

"是的，但根据你告诉我的，以及我已经知道的，一切似乎都没有什么不同。"

'She has a point,' thought Shinji. 'But nothing was out of the ordinary that I can remember. Nothing that struck me as odd.'

'她说的有道理，' 真嗣心想。'但我记得没有什么不寻常的事。没有什么让我觉得奇怪的。'

'That may not be necessarily true though,' said a voice deep inside him.

'不过那也不一定就是真的，' 他内心深处的一个声音说道。

And that made Shinji remember why he himself was in Tokyo-3.

这让他想起了自己为什么会在东京-3。

"Asuka, can I ask you something?"

"明日香，我能问你个问题吗？"

"What!?" she snapped back at him, clearly thinking again.

"什么！？" 她厉声回道，显然又在思考。"

"Have you ever heard about a company here in Tokyo-3 called Nerv?"

"你有没有听说过东京-3 这里有个叫 NERV 的公司？"

Asuka heard the word, or thought she did, but at first thought that Shinji had mumbled something else.

明日香听到了那个词，或者她以为自己听到了，但起初以为真嗣咕哝了别的什么。

"What did you say?" “你说什么？”

"Nerv. A company called Nerv here in Tokyo-3."

“NERV。一个叫 NERV 的公司，在东京-3 这里。”

"How do you know about that?"

"你怎么知道那件事的？"

Shinji wasn't so much surprised by the question as he was surprised at Asuka's tone. Her voice had gone stoney and a dark shadow had passed under her eyes.

真嗣对这个问题并不感到惊讶，他惊讶的是明日香说话的语气。她的声音变得冷硬，眼底也掠过了一抹阴影。

"How do you know about Nerv?" she asked again.

“你怎么知道 NERV 的事？”她再次问道。

"My father asked me to come here. He works at the company."

"我父亲让我来这里的。他在公司工作。"

Asuka frowned heavily at Shinji, but the shadow seemed to have gone from her eyes.

明日香对真嗣皱起了眉头，但她的眼中似乎已经没有了阴影。

"Is there a problem?" asked Shinji hesitantly.

"有什么问题吗？" 真嗣犹豫地问道。

Asuka just stared at Shinji for a long while until she asked, "What is your fathers name?"

明日香只是长时间地盯着真嗣，然后问道：“你父亲的名字是什么？”

"His name? Its Gendo, Gendo Ikari."

“他的名字？是源堂，碇源堂。”

Shinji didn't have trouble at all spotting the obviously surprised look that appeared on Asuka's face. Her eyes widened slightly and even her lips parted to form a small gasp.

真嗣毫不费力地捕捉到了明日香脸上明显惊讶的表情。她的眼睛微微睁大，嘴唇微张，发出了一声轻微的惊呼。

"Er...Asuka...do you know-"

“呃...明日香...你知道——”

But he was cut off as Asuka darted around the fire surprisingly fast, even with her legs as unstable as they were, and sat directly in front of Shinji, grabbing at his shoulders fiercely.

但他的话被突然打断，明日香以惊人的速度绕过火堆，尽管她的双腿如此不稳，她还是直接坐在了真嗣面前，猛地抓住他的肩膀。

"You're the son of Gendo Ikari?" she nearly shouted.

“你是碇源堂的儿子？”她几乎喊了出来。

"Is there something wrong with that?" asked Shinji, only too aware of how close their faces were, and that he could feel Asuka's breath on him.

“这有什么问题吗？”真嗣问道，他非常清楚两人的脸靠得有多近，甚至能感受到明日香呼出的气息。

Asuka relented slightly there, maybe realizing as well how close they were, because she let go of his shoulders and leaned back slightly.

明日香稍微放松了一些，或许她也意识到了两人靠得太近，因为她松开了他的肩膀，稍微向后仰了仰。

"Theres nothing wrong with it," she said, "I was just surprised is all. Your father is the director after all."

"这没什么不对的，" 她说，"我只是有点惊讶罢了。毕竟你父亲是总监。"

"Is it that big a deal?"

"有那么严重吗？"

"You don't even know what Nerv does, do you?"

"你甚至不知道 Nerv 是做什么的，对吧？"

"Not a clue." “毫无头绪。”

Asuka sighed, clearly not in the mood for a full run-through of the purpose of Nerv.

明日香叹了口气，显然没心情详细解释 NERV 的宗旨。

"I'm not saying anything right now, because it would take too long to tell you...but I should I suppose correct what I said earlier and now say that I work for Nerv...or did I guess."

“我现在什么也不想说，因为解释起来太费时间了……不过，我想我应该纠正之前的话，现在说我是为 NERV 工作的……或者我猜是这样。”

"So...everything was a lie from before?"

“所以……一切从一开始就是谎言吗？”

"The thing about my thesis paper? That was all fake. Gehirn though was the predecessor to Nerv, and though I was too young at the time, I heard about it from other people. You're father and some other staff members were in charge at Gehirn, and when that became Nerv, your father took over. My own mother worked at Gehirn for a time."

"关于我的论文？那全是假的。Gehirn 虽然是 Nerv 的前身，尽管我当时还小，但听别人提起过。你的父亲和其他一些工作人员当时负责 Gehirn，后来变成 Nerv 时，你父亲接管了。我母亲也在 Gehirn 工作过一段时间。"

As Asuka said this last part, her voice got quieter, though Shinji didn't really notice this.

当明日香说到最后这部分时，她的声音变小了，尽管真嗣并没有注意到这一点。

"So did Nerv have anything to do with Third Impact."

"那么 Nerv 和第三次冲击有关系吗？"

Asuka hesitated for a second. Shinji already knew about Nerv, and since he was the son of the director, there didn't seem to be any point in not telling him. Not to mention the director had seemed to want him in the city for some reason.

明日香犹豫了一瞬。真嗣已经知道 NERV 的事了，而且既然他是指挥官的儿子，似乎没有理由不告诉他。更不用说指挥官似乎出于某种原因希望他来到这座城市。

'Its possible that he was even supposed to be the Third Child,' thought Asuka suddenly. She had heard that the Third was scheduled to arrive just before she did, but if he was supposed to be the Third Child...

'他甚至可能是预定成为第三适格者的人选，'明日香突然想到。她听说第三适格者计划在她之前到达，但如果他本应是第三适格者的话...

Asuka glanced at Shinji for a brief instance before she shook her head and thought, 'No way someone this weak could pilot an Eva.'

明日香瞥了真嗣一眼，随即摇了摇头，心想：“这种弱不禁风的人怎么可能驾驶 Eva。”

"Partially yes, partially no," replied Asuka to Shinji's earlier question. "They weren't the ones that instrumented it, but they hold some fault I suppose."

"部分是，部分不是，" 明日香对真嗣之前的问题回答道。"他们不是策划者，但他们也有一定的责任，我想。"

"Why?" "为什么？"

"Entirely honest...I'm not sure. I just know what I've been told."

"完全坦白...我不确定。我只知道我所被告知的。"

Shinji waited for more, but Asuka seemed to be done.

真嗣等待着更多的话语，但明日香似乎已经说完了。

"Thats enough for one night though," said Asuka as she started moving back towards her side. Shinji watched her slide herself across the sand for several seconds before he stood up, and wondering what he was doing, walked over to her and held his hand out for her. She looked at it for several seconds, puzzled over what he was implying.

“今晚就到此为止吧，”明日香说着，开始向她那边移动。真嗣注视着她在沙滩上滑行了几秒钟，然后站起身来，心中疑惑着自己该做什么，走向她并伸出手。她盯着他的手看了几秒钟，困惑于他的意图。

"You're legs aren't going to get better if you don't put some pressure on them," said Shinji rather awkwardly.

“如果你不施加点压力，你的腿是不会好转的，”真嗣有些尴尬地说道。

"And I'm supposed to trust your judgement?" asked Asuka, though he did have a point she supposed.

“我凭什么相信你的判断？”明日香问道，不过她觉得他说的也有道理。

So, rather against her wishes, Asuka held out her hand and grasped Shinji's own. He pulled her upward gently, steading her body as he brought it upward, carefully watching her face. She did wince a few times as her legs straightened themselves, and Shinji thought several times that she might collapse from not having used her legs for so long, but she seemed to be tougher than he thought. She even reluctantly placed her left arm upon his shoulders so that she had something to brace against.

于是，尽管心有不甘，明日香还是伸出手握住了真嗣的手。他温柔地将她拉起，稳住她的身体，同时小心翼翼地观察着她的表情。她的双腿在伸展时确实抽搐了几下，真嗣几次担心她会因为长时间未使用双腿而瘫倒，但她似乎比他想象的要坚强。她甚至不情愿地将左臂搭在他的肩上，以便有个支撑。

Asuka didn't bother to look Shinji as she said, "This sucks."

明日香没费心去看真嗣，只是说道：“这太糟糕了。”

"Look who's complaining," replied Shinji.

"看看是谁在抱怨，" 真嗣回答道。

"You offered!" yelled Asuka almost directly in Shinji's ear.

"是你自己提议的！" 明日香几乎直接对着真嗣的耳朵大喊。

Shinji ignored her words and started walking over to her side of the fire, though Asuka seemed to have stopped mid step.

真嗣无视她的话，开始向篝火另一边的她走去，尽管明日香似乎在半途中停下了脚步。

"What are you doing?" asked Shinji, but he was surprised to see that Asuka was looking up at the sky, and the stars that adorned it.

“你在做什么？”真嗣问道，但他惊讶地发现明日香正仰望着天空，以及点缀其上的星星。

"Its strange to see the stars like this," mumbled Asuka, quite unlike herself. "Without the lights from the city, you would have never guessed they were here."

“这样看星星真奇怪，”明日香喃喃自语，与平时大不相同。“没有城市的灯光，你根本想不到它们就在这里。”

"...I suppose..." said Shinji glancing sideways at Asuka. She was smiling slightly as she looked up at the sky, but as she glanced back down and saw him looking at her, her smile immediately changed to that of a frown.

“……我想也是……”真嗣说着，侧目看向明日香。她微微一笑，仰望着天空，但当她低头看到他正看着她时，笑容立刻变成了皱眉。

"What?" she asked bluntly.

"什么？" 她直截了当地问。

"...I think thats the first time I've seen you smile," said Shinji with a smirk.

"...我想这是我第一次看到你笑，" 真嗣带着一丝戏谑说道。

"Between my leg, this shitty food, not having showered for a week, and waking up with sand in my hair every morning, I don't have much to smile about."

"腿间的疼痛，这糟糕的食物，一周没洗澡，每天早上醒来头发里都是沙子，我实在没什么可笑的。"

"...I was just surprised to see you smile...it was refreshing I guess."

"...我只是有点惊讶看到你笑...我想那让人耳目一新吧。"

Asuka looked passively back at Shinji as he said this, and he didn't need her to tell him that she was angry.

明日香被动地回望着真嗣，当他这么说时，他不需要她告诉他，他知道她在生气。

"If my legs only worked," he thought he heard her mumble.

"如果我的腿还能动，"他觉得自己听到她咕哝道。"

Walking around to her side of the fire, Shinji slowly sat down alongside Asuka and let her gain her balance. Of course, not once did she say thanks for the assistance.

绕到篝火的她那边，真嗣缓缓坐下，让明日香稳住身形。当然，她一次也没有为这份帮助道谢。

Standing back up, he walked back around his side and sat down, before laying down in the cool sand.

他站起身，走回自己的位置坐下，然后躺在凉爽的沙地上。

"Hey Asuka?" he asked quietly.

"嘿，明日香？" 他轻声问道。

Her back was turned away from him as she had already pulled the sleeping bag over her body, so at first he thought she didn't hear him, but eventually she replied.

她背对着他，已经拉过睡袋盖在身上，起初他以为她没听见，但最终她还是回应了。

"What Shinji?" "什么，真嗣？"

Shinji was rather surprised that she had used his name, as he didn't think she had spoken it once since they had introduced each other.

真嗣颇为惊讶她竟然叫了他的名字，因为他记得自从他们互相介绍以来，她似乎一次都没提过他的名字。

"Um...is it possible that people from Nerv are still alive? I mean...if they knew this could possibly happen could they have taken steps to build shelters?"

"嗯……NERV 的人还有可能活着吗？我是说……如果他们预见到这种情况可能发生，会不会采取措施建造避难所？"

Asuka didn't honestly think so. If avoiding Third Impact was so easy, then everyone would have built shelters. Of course, that doesn't really begin to explain how her and Shinji were alive.

明日香并不这么认为。如果避免第三次冲击如此简单，那么所有人都会建造避难所。当然，这还远不足以解释她和真嗣是如何活下来的。

"Maybe, I'm not sure," she replied offhandedly.

“也许吧，我不确定。”她随口答道。

Shinji didn't reply, too absorbed in his own thoughts.

真嗣没有回应，他沉浸在自己的思绪中。

Rolling over on his back, he faced away from Asuka and tried to go to sleep, thoughts of Nerv and his father whirling around in his mind. Across the fire from him, thoughts of her mother filled Asuka, as did her wonderings about Shinji being the Third Child.

翻身仰躺，他背对着明日香，试图入睡，NERV 和父亲的思绪在脑海中盘旋。火堆对面，母亲的形象填满了明日香的心，同时她也在揣测着真嗣是否就是第三适格者。

### Chapter 5: Progression

Refer to previous chapter for stuff I talk about. Although, on another note, anybody see Evangelion 3.0 yet? I know it comes out in the states on the 11 of January (if you can believe IMDB) but anyone see it in Japan?

请参考之前的 chapter 了解我讨论的内容。不过，顺便一提，有人看过《新世纪福音战士 3.0》吗？我知道它在美国是 1 月 11 日上映的（如果你相信 IMDB 的话），但在日本有人看过了吗？

---

Asuka and Shinji seemed to be on friendlier terms the next day as they both spoke that morning, though Shinji did most of the talking. Asuka had even started using Shinji's name to the point that it became natural. Though in what context she used it was an entirely different matter.

第二天，明日香和真嗣似乎关系更融洽了，他们早上都在交谈，尽管大部分是真嗣在说话。明日香甚至开始自然地使用真嗣的名字。不过，她使用这个名字的场合则完全是另一回事。

Shinji cooked breakfast with what he had found the previous day, and Asuka didn't seem to have any complaints about it. They had more rice and a small portion of canned corn each. As they both finished, Shinji went to wash the pot and dishes in the ocean, while Asuka lay back down bored. Now that she was awake and had food in her stomach, she was feeling incredibly restless. She even rather wished she had something to read, just to alleviate the boredom.

真嗣用前一天找到的食材做了早餐，明日香似乎对此并无怨言。他们每人分到了更多的米饭和一小份罐装玉米。吃完后，真嗣去海边洗锅和餐具，而明日香则无聊地躺了回去。现在她醒了，肚子里也有了食物，感到异常焦躁。她甚至宁愿有本书可读，只为缓解这无聊。

As Shinji returned, wiping the silver on his shirt as he went, Asuka turned to him and said-

当真嗣回来时，边走边用衬衫擦拭着银器，明日香转向他，说道——

"So? What were you going to do today?"

“所以？你今天打算做什么？”

Shrugging, Shinji replied, "I don't know. As far as supplies go, we have enough for several days so I won't need to go into the city for a while, not for anything important anyways. Why?"

耸了耸肩，真嗣回答道：“我不知道。就补给而言，我们足够维持好几天，所以我不需要进城，至少不是为了什么重要的事情。怎么了？”

Asuka stared at him for a few seconds before she turned away from him and said, "No particular reason really."

明日香盯着他看了几秒钟，然后转过身去，说道：“真的没什么特别的原因。”

"Well, I was hoping that we could continue our conversation from yesterday...if possible," said Shinji.

“嗯，我希望我们能继续昨天的话题……如果可能的话，”真嗣说。

While Asuka didn't have any problem with this, she didn't want to have to worry about something right now. She had spent a good deal of time thinking about this last night and this morning, but she still couldn't wrap her mind around the fact that Shinji could have been the Third Child. Everything seemed to fit into place it certainly seemed, but she just couldn't imagine this scrawny kid piloting an Evangelion.

虽然明日香对此并无异议，但她现在不想为任何事情操心。昨晚到今早，她花了不少时间思考这个问题，但仍然无法接受真嗣可能是第三适格者的事实。一切似乎都合情合理，但她就是无法想象这个瘦弱的孩子能驾驶 EVA。

"We can talk about that later, I'd rather not have to worry about anything right now."

“我们晚点再谈吧，我现在不想担心任何事。”

As Shinji looked at Asuka's back, he sighed and said, "Okay...well, if you're going to go back to sleep, I suppose I'll go walk the beach for a while."

看着明日香的背影，真嗣叹了口气说：“好吧……既然你要回去睡觉，那我就去海边走走吧。”

'Who said I was going back to sleep?' grumbled Asuka in her mind. Though as Shinji started to walk in the opposite direction, Asuka thought of something.

“谁说我还要回去睡觉的？”明日香在心里咕哝着。然而，当真嗣开始朝相反方向走去时，明日香突然想到了什么。

"Hey Shinji!" “嘿，真嗣！”

Shinji paused and turned around, surprised by the tone in Asuka's voice. He hadn't quite gotten used to her calling him by his name since she had never used it before.

真嗣停下脚步，转过身来，被明日香声音中的语气吓了一跳。自从她之前从未这样叫过他之后，他还没完全习惯她叫他的名字。

"What?" he asked rather nervously. He thought she was angry at him for a second.

"什么？" 他有些紧张地问道。他以为她生他的气了，哪怕只有一瞬间。

Asuka opened her mouth, but nothing came out. The thought had struck her suddenly as she had been lying there, and after last night, it made sense when she thought about. Even so though, asking for Shinji's help was an entirely different thing.

明日香张开嘴，却什么也没说出来。这个念头是她在躺着的时候突然冒出来的，经过昨晚的事情，她觉得这很合理。即便如此，向真嗣求助却是另一回事。

"Wh-Why are you going out walking?" asked Asuka, determined to at least say something.

"为、为什么你要出去散步？" 明日香问道，决心至少要说些什么。

"Is there something wrong with that?" replied Shinji.

"那有什么问题吗？" 真嗣回答道。

"I thought you said you didn't have any reason to today."

"我记得你说过今天没什么理由要出去的。"

"I said I don't have a reason to go into the city, and besides, I like walking. I did do that a lot when I first came to Tokyo-3 before all this happened."

"我说了我没有进城的理由，而且，我喜欢走路。在我刚到第三新东京市的时候，这一切发生之前，我确实经常这么做。"

Asuka bit her lip; was it so hard to just ask?

明日香咬了咬嘴唇；难道就这么难开口吗？

Shinji watched her for a few seconds longer and when she didn't seem to be saying anything else, he started walking again. But Asuka wasn't about to give up so easily.

真嗣又多看了她几秒钟，见她似乎没有再说什么，便重新开始走路。但明日香可没那么容易放弃。

"Hold on a minute! I wasn't done!"

“等一下！我还没说完呢！”

Shinji was almost tempted to ignore her before he turned around again and stared right at her, the fire crackling in between them.

真嗣几乎忍不住要无视她，但最终还是转过身来，直直地盯着她，两人之间火堆噼啪作响。

"Instead of wasting your time walking, I need your help with something."

“与其浪费时间走路，我需要你帮忙做点事。”

The words weren't exactly as Asuka had intended them to be, but she hoped Shinji understood what she meant. Just asking for help from him was taking all of Asuka's willpower. How long had it been since she had asked for help? She couldn't very well ignore the circumstances they were in and was once again reminded that if not for him, she would be dead.

这些话并非完全如明日香所愿，但她希望真嗣能理解她的意思。仅仅是向他求助，就已经耗尽了明日香所有的意志力。她有多久没向人求助了？她无法忽视当前的处境，又一次意识到如果不是因为他，她早已不在人世。

Shinji did understand what she meant, but thought it could have been phrased differently. Even so, he thought it somewhat funny that it had taken her that long to ask for his help.

真嗣确实理解了她的意思，但觉得可以换个说法。即便如此，他觉得她花了这么长时间才向他求助，有点好笑。

"Okay, what is it?" asked Shinji as he started taking a step back towards her.

“好吧，怎么了？” 真嗣一边问，一边开始向后退向她。

"Walking," said Asuka simply.

“散步，”明日香简单地回答。

This made Shinji pause ever so slightly as he continued towards her.

这让真嗣微微一顿，他继续向她走去。

"And if possible, making a set of crutches."

“如果可能的话，再做一副拐杖。”

'How long does she expect this to last?' wondered Shinji.

“她预计这要持续多久？”真嗣暗自思忖。

As Shinji reached the fire again, he crouched down and picked up a bottle of the LCL fluid and downed several mouthfuls. Wiping his mouth on his sleeve he said-

当真嗣再次走近火堆时，他蹲下身，拿起一瓶 LCL 液体，连喝了几大口。用袖子擦了擦嘴，他说道——

"I can help you start walking again easy enough, but I've no idea how crutches are supposed to work."

"我可以帮你重新学会走路，这不难，但我对拐杖怎么用一窍不通。"

"Well luckily I do," said Asuka with a hint of her superiority. Shinji would have dearly liked to egg her on, but decided not to since Asuka seemed serious about this.

"幸运的是我懂，" 明日香带着一丝优越感说道。真嗣本想逗逗她，但看她似乎很认真，便决定不打岔了。

"We can worry about the crutches later I suppose, walking though..." Shinji paused for a minute before he resumed talking. "How do your legs feel?"

“关于拐杖的事，我们稍后再担心吧，先说说走路的事……” 真嗣停顿了一下，然后继续说道。“你的腿感觉怎么样？”

"Same as usual," said Asuka a she ran her hands down her legs. "Same as always," mumbled Asuka, this time with a little bit of sadness in her voice. Whether she had intended this, or if her guard had simply cracked a bit, Shinji couldn't say he enjoyed seeing Asuka saddened like this. Her unmovable legs had become such an normal thing that he had forgotten how much of an inconvenience it must be for her. Not to mention she seemed to be the kind of person who preferred doing things themselves.

“和平时一样，”明日香一边说，一边用手抚摸着自己的双腿。“一如既往，”明日香这次低声说道，声音中带着一丝悲伤。无论这是否是她有意为之，还是她的防线稍稍松动，真嗣看到明日香这样难过，心里并不好受。她那无法移动的双腿已经变得如此平常，以至于他忘记了这对她来说是多么的不便。更不用说她似乎是那种更喜欢自己做事的人。

"I'm honestly not sure how much help it'll be," said Shinji eventually, "but if you need help walking, I can do that much."

“老实说，我不确定这能有多大帮助，”真嗣最终说道，“但如果你需要帮助走路，我可以做到这一点。”

"Yeah," replied Asuka rather offhandedly, not quite meeting Shinji's eyes.

“嗯，”明日香有些漫不经心地回答，眼神并未完全与真嗣对视。

Walking around to her side of the fire, Shinji bent down next to Asuka, letting her put an arm around his back and resting it on his shoulder. They both seemed to be aware of how close they were, but neither said anything about it. If they were going to be living together like this for a while, stuff like this was only assumed.

真嗣绕到火堆的另一边，蹲在明日香身旁，让她可以把手臂搭在自己的背上，靠在他的肩膀上。两人似乎都意识到了彼此的距离有多近，但谁也没有提及。如果他们要这样一起生活一段时间，这种事情只是理所当然的。

Shinji slowly stood up as Asuka seemed to gather more strength, only moving as fast as she did, His body was more or less something that she could hold her weight against as she pushed herself upwards. Shinji didn't know whether Asuka was in any pain or not, but knew that even if she was, she wouldn't cry in pain, let him know, or even let it show on her face. She was just that stubborn. This brought a smile to his face, which Asuka did notice, considering how close there faces were.

随着明日香似乎恢复了些力气，真嗣缓缓站起身，动作仅与她同步。他的身体成了她支撑自己站起来的依靠。真嗣不知道明日香是否感到疼痛，但他知道，即使她疼，她也不会哭喊，不会让他知道，甚至不会在脸上显露出来。她就是那么倔强。这让真嗣露出了微笑，明日香也注意到了，毕竟他们的脸靠得那么近。

"What?" she asked rather snappishly, thinking that he was amused at how much difficulty she was having.

“什么？”她有些不耐烦地问道，以为他在嘲笑她遇到的困难有多大。

"No, nothing," replied Shinji hurriedly.

“不，没什么，”真嗣连忙回答。

"Instead of grinning like an idiot then, how about you help me?" complained Asuka, her anger starting to flare.

"与其那时像个傻子一样傻笑，不如来帮我一把？"明日香抱怨道，怒火开始升腾。

'Or I could just dump you on your ass,' thought Shinji for a brief moment, but he wasn't about to do such a spiteful thing.

'或者我可以直接把你摔个屁股蹲儿，' 真嗣脑海中闪过这个念头，但他并不打算做出如此恶意的事情。

Shinji brought his own hand up then and braced it against her back, being sure that she wouldn't fall over. As usual, he was amazed at how cool and smooth the fabric felt as he touched her odd clothes.

真嗣随后抬起自己的手，撑在她的背上，确保她不会摔倒。一如既往地，他惊叹于那奇异衣料在他触摸下所感受到的凉爽与光滑。

"Okay," mumbled Asuka as she took several short pauses before she forced herself upward, standing on both her legs. They still didn't seem to want to listen to her, because she would have gone crashing back to the ground if not for Shinji's hand on her back. Shinji didn't say a word of this, because he could tell that Asuka was seething from seeming so helpless. He had quickly learned when to speak his mind and when to keep quiet.

"好吧，"明日香咕哝着，在强迫自己站起来之前停顿了几次，双脚站立。它们似乎仍然不听使唤，要不是真嗣的手扶在她背上，她早就摔回地上了。真嗣对此一言不发，因为他看得出明日香正因显得如此无助而怒火中烧。他很快就学会了何时该直言不讳，何时该保持沉默。

'Right, I can do this,' thought Asuka as she stood haphazardly upright. Was this what a newborn felt as they learned to walk? Asuka couldn't imagine it being very different.

'对，我能做到，' 明日香一边想着，一边摇摇晃晃地站直了身子。新生儿学走路时就是这种感觉吗？明日香无法想象会有多大差别。

Feeling incredibly stupid, she declared to Shinji, "I'm going to try walking forward."

她感到无比愚蠢，对真嗣宣布道："我要试着向前走。"

'Don't push yourself,' was at the forefront of Shinji's mind, but he held his tongue and instead replied, "Alright..."

“别勉强自己”是真嗣脑海中最先浮现的想法，但他忍住了没说出口，而是回答道："好吧..."

Just lifting her leg seemed to take great amounts of effort and strain and Asuka was beginning to wonder if the nerves in her legs were no longer receiving pulses from the brain. Eventually though, she did manage to take one step forward. What she didn't want to admit was that without Shinji, she wouldn't have even made it a quarter this far.

仅仅是抬起腿似乎就耗费了巨大的努力和紧张，明日香开始怀疑她腿部的神经是否已经不再接收大脑的脉冲信号。不过最终，她还是设法向前迈出了一步。她不愿承认的是，如果没有真嗣，她甚至无法走到现在的四分之一距离。

Her legs were starting to catch fire it seems as her muscles screamed out at her. Pain wasn't anything new to her by any means, but even so, it still hurt. And after the pain she had felt while Shinji and herself had parted briefly, well, she didn't want to experience anything like that ever again. Knowing that her muscles wouldn't be able to take the strain much longer, she relented and said to Shinji-

她的双腿似乎开始燃烧，肌肉向她发出痛苦的呐喊。疼痛对她来说并不新鲜，但即便如此，依然很痛。在真嗣和她短暂分别时所感受到的痛苦之后，她再也不想经历类似的事情了。意识到她的肌肉无法承受更长时间的紧张，她让步了，对真嗣说——

"I think thats as much as I can do right now."

“我想我现在只能做到这样了。”

Shinji was rather surprised that she had accomplished even that much, but he had to put his mind into things elsewhere as Asuka seemed to collapse in his arms as the energy left her body. He was now holding her entirely up by his own body, though it wasn't as though she was very heavy to begin with. Gently lowering her back to the sleeping bag, Asuka didn't say a word of thanks as she was either too tired, or too embarrassed by what had transpired. Shinji couldn't tell which though.

真嗣颇为惊讶她竟然能做到这一步，但他的思绪不得不转移到其他事情上，因为明日香似乎在他怀里失去了力气，瘫软下来。他现在完全靠自己的身体支撑着她，尽管她原本就不算重。他轻轻地将她放回睡袋，明日香没有说一句感谢的话，可能是因为太累了，或者是因为刚才发生的事情感到尴尬。真嗣无法判断是哪一种。

After doing this, he retreated to his own side of the fire and sat down, all thoughts of going on his own walk gone. It wasn't as though he was tired, but after seeing Asuka put in the effort of moving her legs, he couldn't very well go off and leave her, at least, this is what he thought.

做完这些后，他退回到火堆的另一边坐下，原本打算独自散步的念头已经消失无踪。他并不觉得累，但看到明日香努力移动双腿的样子，他实在无法就这样离开她，至少，他是这么想的。

They both lapsed into a long silence and Asuka seemed to go to sleep, exhausted after what had happened, leaving Shinji to fumble with his own thoughts.

他们俩都陷入了长时间的沉默，明日香似乎在经历了这一切后疲惫地睡着了，留下真嗣独自摸索着自己的思绪。

Later in the evening, Asuka woke again, feeling well rested and more importantly hungry; it seemed that her temper had returned as well. Shinji hurriedly made dinner consisting of much the same as they had had the previous night. Asuka seemed to realize that complaining wasn't going to do her any good, so she barely opened her mouth to speak during dinner.

傍晚时分，明日香再次醒来，感觉休息得很好，更重要的是饿了；看来她的脾气也回来了。真嗣急忙做了晚餐，内容与前一晚大致相同。明日香似乎意识到抱怨对她没有任何好处，所以在晚餐期间她几乎没怎么开口说话。

After Shinji had finished cleaning up though, he was hoping that she would now be in a mood to talk.

然而，当真嗣收拾完毕后，他希望明日香现在能有心情聊聊。

"Hey Asuka?" asked Shinji as he returned from the ocean.

“嘿，明日香？” 真嗣从海边回来时问道。

"What?" she replied without looking at him. She was laying down on her back and looking up at the sky blankly. Evening was starting to turn into night.

“什么？” 她没有看他，回答道。她正仰面躺着，茫然地望着天空。傍晚渐渐转为夜晚。

"Can we continue from yesterday?"

"我们能从昨天继续吗？"

"Continue what?" asked Asuka with a slight sneer in her voice.

"继续什么？" 明日香带着一丝嘲讽的语气问道。

'How was it that she was able to flip personalities so easily?' wondered Shinji.

“她怎么能如此轻易地转换性格呢？”真嗣疑惑道。

"Yesterday, when we were talking about Third Impact and Nerv and everything," said Shinji feeling sorta stupid. He still didn't know much about either of these things, but he was hoping that Asuka was going to tell him more.

“昨天，我们聊到第三次冲击和 NERV 以及所有那些事情的时候，”真嗣有些尴尬地说道。他对于这些事情了解得并不多，但他希望明日香能告诉他更多。

"Hmph," grumbled Asuka as she closed her eyes and opened them in annoyance, though she couldn't really ignore this either; she had some questions for Shinji herself.

“哼，”明日香咕哝着，闭上眼睛又带着不悦睁开，尽管她也无法真正忽视这一点；她自己也有问题想问真嗣。

"Fine then," said Asuka as she sat up, wrapping the sleeping bag around her body as she did so and scooted closer to the fire. "But first I want to ask you something myself."

“好吧，”明日香说着坐起身，用睡袋裹住自己，挪近火堆。“但首先我想问你一些事情。”

Shinji was rather surprised at this, but he nodded his head all the same and said, "Okay, what?"

真嗣对此颇感意外，但他还是点了点头，问道：“好吧，什么？”

"Tell me what Nerv does."

告诉我 NERV 是做什么的。

Shinji thought he misheard her.

真嗣以为自己听错了。

"Huh?" he gaped. "How can I tell you when I don't even know myself?"

"啊？" 他目瞪口呆。"我自己都不知道，怎么告诉你？"

"Your own father is the director of Nerv. Certainly you must have some idea of what he does," said Asuka almost bored.

"你自己的父亲是 NERV 的指挥官。你肯定对他做的事情有些了解，" 明日香几乎有些不耐烦地说。

"I told you, he never mentioned anything about his work at any point in time to me."

"我告诉过你，他从未在任何时候向我提起过他的工作。"

"Fine then. In your own words, tell me what Nerv does."

"那好吧。用你自己的话，告诉我 Nerv 是做什么的。"

'That was almost just as hard,' thought Shinji.

'这几乎同样困难，'真嗣心想。

"Well...if I had to guess, it would have something to do with Tokyo-3 I suppose. And you said before that Nerv might have had a hand in what happened here so...human experiments...of some kind, I guess?"

"嗯...如果非要猜的话，我想可能和第三新东京市有关吧。而且你之前提到过，NERV 可能与此地发生的事情有关，所以...大概是某种...人体实验之类的吧？"

Asuka watched him for several seconds, the fire flickering in her ocean blue eyes before she shrugged and said, "Well, its not like I expected anything better from someone who doesn't know anything."

明日香盯着他看了好几秒，眼中跳动的火焰映衬着她深海般的蓝眸，随后她耸了耸肩说道：“哼，我也没指望一个什么都不知道的人能说出什么有价值的东西。”

'So then tell me already damn it,' thought Shinji angrily. But he waited patiently nonetheless.

'那就快点告诉我啊，该死的，' 真嗣心中愤怒地想着。但他还是耐心地等待着。

Asuka still seemed to be gauging him though, trying to decide whether he could have been the Third Child or not. The possibility was slim certainly...but...

明日香似乎仍在评估他，试图判断他是否可能是第三适格者。这种可能性确实微乎其微...但...

"You said before that when your father had you come here to Tokyo-3, he didn't say a word about what he wanted you here for?"

"你之前说过，你父亲让你来第三新东京市时，他什么都没告诉你他为什么让你来这里？"

"Nothing," replied Shinji with a nod.

"什么都没说，" 真嗣点头回答道。

Asuka bit her lip, stubbornly refusing to believe what her mind was starting to shift towards.

明日香咬着嘴唇，固执地拒绝相信她的思绪开始转向的念头。

'Well, whether it mattered then, it doesn't matter anymore,' Asuka told herself. 'So mentioning it now is entirely pointless probably.'

“好吧，无论当时是否重要，现在都无关紧要了，”明日香自言自语道，“所以现在提起它大概毫无意义。”

Probably, but not necessarily.

或许吧，但未必如此。

Asuka ignored this other part of her mind telling her otherwise.

明日香无视了内心另一个声音的反驳。

After Asuka finished asking Shinji her questions, she dived in telling him everything about Nerv. The angels, the Evangelion, the children selected for the process, herself, Rei, the individual responsibilities of the personal, the reason only children born after Second Impact could pilot the Evangelions. She covered everything that she had been taught in Germany. She even told him about the function of the LCL fluid and the feel of being in the entry plug. It was enough to make Shinji's head swim.

在明日香向真嗣问完她的问题后，她开始滔滔不绝地向他讲述关于 NERV 的一切。使徒、福音战士、被选中的孩子们、她自己、丽、每个人的职责、为什么只有第二次冲击后出生的孩子才能驾驶福音战士。她把自己在德国所学的一切都告诉了他。她甚至向他解释了 LCL 液体的功能以及进入插入栓时的感觉。这些信息多到让真嗣感到头晕目眩。

As Asuka finished explaining everything, she let out a low sigh and took several large mouthfuls of water. As she did so, Shinji remembered that they had been drinking that stuff this entire time. He suddenly felt like retching.

当明日香解释完一切后，她轻轻叹了口气，大口喝了几口水。与此同时，真嗣想起来他们一直在喝这种东西。他突然感到一阵恶心。

As Asuka set her bottle down she raised an eyebrow and said, "Well, believe me or not?"

当明日香放下瓶子时，她挑了挑眉，说道：“好吧，信不信由你？”

"I'm not sure," mumbled Shinji, his head still a jumble of everything. If she was lying again, then it was the the worst lie in the world. But Shinji didn't think it could have been anything but the truth.

"我不确定，" 真嗣咕哝着，他的思绪依旧一片混乱。如果她又在撒谎，那这将是世界上最糟糕的谎言。但真嗣不认为那可能不是真的。

"Why would I lie about something like this? What would I have to gain?"

"我为什么要对这种事撒谎？我能从中得到什么？"

"Nothing I guess," said Shinji, "But...even so, its rather far fetched."

"我想什么也没有，" 真嗣说，"但是...即便如此，这也太离奇了。"

"Believe it or don't, it doesn't really make any difference now though."

信不信由你，现在这真的没什么区别了。

"Doesn't it? I would have figured that these angels probably caused Third Impact."

难道不是吗？我本以为这些天使可能引发了第三次冲击。

Asuka had forgotten about that, and it showed on her face. Guess Shinji wasn't as stupid as she was being led to believe.

明日香已经忘记了那件事，她的脸上显露无疑。看来真嗣并不像她被引导相信的那样愚蠢。

"Yes, that is probably the truth of it," sighed Asuka. "But there isn't anyway to know if that is what actually happened."

“是的，那很可能是真相，”明日香叹息道，“但我们无法知道那是否真的发生了。”

"But they could come back," said Shinji, suddenly feeling very worried. "If everybody is gone because of these angel things, maybe they would come back for us."

“但他们可能会回来，”真嗣突然感到非常担忧，“如果所有人因为这些天使而消失，也许他们会回来找我们。”

'Tail right between his legs,' thought Asuka with a slight grin.

"'尾巴夹得紧紧的，' 明日香心中暗想，嘴角微微上扬。

"Worrying about it isn't going to do us any good though," shrugged Asuka.

"“担心也没用，”明日香耸耸肩，“反正对我们没好处。”

Shinji seemed that he would like to argue back, but Asuka was starting to glare at him, so he was forced to shut his mouth. Still, something wasn't making sense to him. Asuka was supposed to fight these angel things in something called an Evangelion that was similar to a giant robot. If the angels had attacked Tokyo-3 and Nerv, then why was she here? Had she been unable to stop there attack, or had she never been deployed to attack in the first place? The plug suit that she wore was evidence enough that she had been preparing for something she had told him, but other than that, she didn't know anything else. Course it was the same with him. A part of his memory seemed to have been scooped out of him.

真嗣似乎想反驳，但明日香已经开始瞪他了，他只好闭嘴。不过，有些事情他还是想不通。明日香本该驾驶名为 EVA 的巨型机器人与使徒战斗。如果使徒已经袭击了第三新东京市和 NERV，那她为什么还在这里？是她没能阻止袭击，还是根本就没被派去战斗？她穿的插入栓服足以证明她曾为某事做准备，除此之外，她一无所知。他也是一样，记忆中的一部分仿佛被挖走了。

"Asu-"

"Now what?" she groaned as she turned back towards him. After she had finished talking, she had laid down and turned away from him.

"现在怎么办？" 她呻吟着转回身面对他。说完话后，她躺下并背对着他。

"Is it possible that my dad wanted me to do something at Nerv...thats why he asked me to come to Tokyo-3. You said before that only a child born after Second Impact could pilot an Evangelion. Could I have done that?"

"有没有可能我爸爸希望我在 NERV 做些什么...这就是他让我来东京-3 的原因。你之前说过，只有第二次冲击后出生的孩子才能驾驶 EVA。我会不会也能做到呢？"

Asuka's first inclination was to scream 'no' at him and then laugh at him for even suggesting such a ludicrous thing, but everything seemed to point in the opposite direction.

明日香的第一反应本是大声对他喊“不”，然后嘲笑他竟会提出如此荒谬的建议，但所有迹象似乎都指向了相反的方向。

Without turning back to look at him, she mumbled, "I think so. Maybe that was what your father wanted you here for, but maybe not. Without anything more solid than that, I can't really say."

她没有回头看他，只是含糊地嘀咕道：“我想是的。也许这就是你父亲让你来这里的原因，但也可能不是。没有更确凿的证据，我实在无法断言。”

Shinji didn't reply to that, wondering if that was what she really thought. Asuka didn't seem to be in any mood to talk anymore though, because she had passed into a deep sleep, sighing softly.

真嗣没有回应，不知道这是否是她真正的想法。但明日香似乎已经没有心情再聊下去了，因为她已经沉沉睡去，轻轻叹了口气。

Shinji was still thinking about the Evangelions as Asuka had told him about them, and wondering what it would have been like to pilot them. Asuka hadn't elaborated on what it was like, only describing them in brief detail as was needed, but Shinji had an idea that it wasn't easy.

真嗣仍在思考明日香告诉他的关于 EVA 的事情，想象着驾驶它们会是什么感觉。明日香并没有详细描述驾驶的感受，只是简略地提到了一些必要的细节，但真嗣隐约觉得那并不容易。

Things were still bothering him though, and it wasn't so much about the gap in his memory, or the fact that he could have been an Evangelion pilot like Asuka. No, it just seemed that everything was too perfect. Before, he thought that Asuka and himself met each other by happenstance, but after the past two days, he wasn't so sure. Both of them were eerily similar in ways that Shinji couldn't explain, and then there was the connection that they had with Nerv. If it wasn't happenstance, and they had been thrown together like this on purpose.

尽管如此，有些事情仍然困扰着他，并非关于记忆中的空白，或是他可能像明日香一样成为 EVA 驾驶员的事实。不，只是这一切似乎太过完美了。以前，他以为自己和明日香的相遇纯属偶然，但经过过去的两天，他不再那么确定。他们之间有着难以言喻的惊人相似，以及与 NERV 之间那层联系。如果不是偶然，而是有意将他们如此安排在一起的话。

Why though? That was the question...

可为什么呢？这便是问题所在……

But Shinji didn't have an answer to that, nor did he think he'd acquire that answer anytime in the future.

但真嗣对此没有答案，也不认为将来会找到答案。

The days passed more slowly then it seemed. But everyday, Shinji helped Asuka steadily move forward more. It seemed she was adamant on doing this, and even after falling one time in which Shinji hadn't managed to catch her, she didn't seem put off in the last, but simply asked for him to help her back up. She was regaining her strength quickly, much to Shinji's astonishment, but Asuka didn't seem to be surprised in the least. She had always been athletic, so something of this nature was only natural for her. They had even decided to give up on the idea of making crutches. Each day she got farther and farther in her steps, and it seemed that her eventual goal seemed to be the ocean. It got to the point that Shinji didn't have to worry about her falling as much, and Asuka seemed to be glad that he let her walk on her own now, though he was still keeping a careful eye on her just in case she rebounded. She wasn't sure whether to be thankful or annoyed, though she still hadn't said her thanks yet, so Shinji usually got the annoyed part.

日子似乎过得更慢了。但每一天，真嗣都帮助明日香稳步前进。她似乎决心这么做，甚至在有一次真嗣没能接住她而摔倒后，她并没有气馁，只是简单地要求他扶她起来。她恢复力量的速度让真嗣惊讶，但明日香似乎一点也不意外。她一直都很擅长运动，所以这种事情对她来说很自然。他们甚至放弃了制作拐杖的想法。每天她都能走得更远，她的最终目标似乎是大海。到了真嗣不必太担心她会摔倒的地步，明日香似乎很高兴他现在让她自己走，尽管他仍然小心翼翼地看着她以防万一她再次摔倒。她不确定是该感谢还是感到烦恼，尽管她还没有说出感谢的话，所以真嗣通常会感受到她的烦恼。

On the last day, during which she finally made it to the ocean, she had told Shinji that she wanted to do this entirely on her own, and that if he helped her, she would hit him. Asuka's verbal abuse seemed to have grown to physical now as well, because she didn't seem to mind hitting him if he annoyed her. Though the only time she ever did was during these walks since this was the only time they were particularly close to each other. Shinji thought he caught her smiling sometimes when she hit him though, and he didn't seem to mind that much as well. Her blows stung at first, but quickly subsided. He had never really noticed how small her hands were until then.

在最后一天，她终于抵达了海洋，她告诉真嗣她想完全靠自己完成这件事，如果他帮忙，她会揍他。明日香的言语攻击似乎也升级到了肢体层面，因为她似乎并不介意在他惹恼她时动手。尽管她只在这些散步时才会这样做，因为这是他们唯一特别亲近的时刻。真嗣觉得有时她打他时似乎在笑，而他对此也不太介意。她的拳头起初刺痛，但很快消退。直到那时，他才真正注意到她的手有多小。

Though she still moved slow, and running seemed to be outside her possibilities right now, she didn't have any problems walking right now. Shinji had been wondering why Asuka's legs hadn't been working for a while, but she explained it simply, saying that if they weren't used, they would atrophy. Shinji didn't think it was just this reason, but he let it slide for now.

尽管她依旧行动缓慢，跑步似乎超出了她目前的极限，但她现在走路完全没有问题。真嗣一直纳闷为什么明日香的双腿有一阵子不能动了，但她简单地解释说，如果不使用，肌肉就会萎缩。真嗣觉得原因不止如此，但他暂时没有深究。

After what seemed to take an entire hour, Asuka finally made it to the surf of Tokyo-3 and sat down, letting the surf wash over her feet.

仿佛过了一个世纪那么久，明日香终于抵达了第三新东京市的浪边，坐下来，任由海浪冲刷着她的双脚。

'She seems to be enjoying herself,' thought Shinji as he walked up behind her and stood there, looking out across the ocean. This was the only time that they really talked much. Asuka told him what it was like to work at Nerv, and what the people were like there. Shinji had asked her what his father was like, but to that Asuka couldn't answer that. She had only met the commander a handful of times afterall. Shinji on the other hand told Asuka about the places he'd been to, all the different school he'd gone to, and the many roommates he'd had. Though she seemed bored most of the time, he suspected she liked hearing something at least while she walked.

'她似乎很享受，'真嗣心想，他走到她身后，站在那里，眺望着大海。这是他们真正交谈最多的时候。明日香告诉他 Nerv 的工作是什么样的，那里的人又是怎样的。真嗣问过她父亲是什么样的人，但对此明日香无法回答。毕竟，她只见过指挥官几次而已。而真嗣则向明日香讲述了他去过的那些地方，所有不同的学校，以及他曾有过的许多室友。尽管她大部分时间看起来很无聊，但他猜想她至少在散步时喜欢听些东西。

"I didn't think I'd be returning to this spot like this," said Asuka in quite voice after a few seconds.

“我从没想过会以这种方式回到这个地方，”几秒钟后，明日香轻声说道。

"Hmm?" asked Shinji confused.

"嗯？" 真嗣困惑地问道。

Asuka was silent again, seeming unable to speak what was on her mind.

明日香再次沉默，似乎无法说出她心中的想法。

"When you left before, I crawled over here to get water, knowing I wouldn't last long without it. I don't even know how long ago that was now."

"上次你离开后，我知道没有水我撑不了多久，就爬过来取水。我现在甚至不知道那是多久以前的事了。"

"More than a week," said Shinji. It was starting to become difficult to tell the days apart. He had no idea what month it even was anymore.

“超过一周了。” 真嗣说道。日子开始变得难以区分。他甚至不知道现在是什么月份了。

"It seems longer," sighed Asuka as she wrapped her arms around her legs as she sat there. Shinji decided to sit down beside her then, there arms brushing against each other as he did. Asuka no longer flinched at the contact like she used to.

“感觉更久。” 明日香叹息着，双臂环抱双腿坐在那里。真嗣决定坐在她旁边，他们的手臂轻轻碰触。明日香不再像以前那样对这种接触感到退缩。

"How much longer are we going to be here?" wondered Asuka.

“我们还要在这里待多久？” 明日香问道。

"On this beach?" asked Shinji.

"在这片海滩上？" 真嗣问道。

"No, Tokyo-3," snapped Asuka, her patience wearing thin. Shinji wasn't sure if she was being sarcastic or not though.

"不，第三新东京市，" 明日香厉声说道，她的耐心正在消磨殆尽。真嗣不确定她是否在讽刺。

"I don't know...why?" "我不知道...为什么？"

"I'm sick of it here," she grumbled.

"我受够了这里，" 她咕哝着。

Shinji supposed he was as well now that she mentioned it. But where would they go instead?

碇真嗣想了想，既然她提到了，自己现在也确实如此。但他们会去哪儿呢？

There previous supplies had dwindled several days ago. Asuka seemed to be eating twice as much than before she started walking, and though Shinji wasn't about to point this out to her, he knew it would be a problem. So after helping her along one afternoon, he spent much of the evening looking for more supplies, and he had come back rather successful. He had spent so much time sleeping restlessly on the sand that he had forgotten what it had been like to be warm, but that was before he found the second sleeping bag.

之前的补给早在几天前就已所剩无几。明日香似乎比开始徒步前吃得多了两倍，尽管真嗣不打算向她指出这一点，但他知道这会是个问题。于是在某个下午帮她前行后，他花了不少时间在晚上寻找更多补给，并相当成功地返回了。他在沙滩上辗转反侧、难以入眠的日子里，几乎忘记了温暖的感觉是怎样的，但那是在他找到第二个睡袋之前的事了。

He had luckily found another department store and spent a good deal of time going through the place. The building was largely intact with only small sections of the roof having crumbled away, but it was nothing terrible. Shinji had found a proper spit for which to cook on now as well along with a cutting knife. He hadn't used the knife yet, but he had wished he had had it several days before. He had stocked up on more canned food at the store as well, packing everything he could find in the camping backpack.

幸运的是，他找到了另一家百货商店，并在那里花了大量时间仔细搜寻。建筑大体完好，只有屋顶的小部分坍塌，但并不严重。真嗣找到了一个合适的烤架，还找到了一把切肉刀。他还没用过那把刀，但他希望几天前就有它。他在商店里补充了更多罐头食品，把能找到的东西都塞进了露营背包。

The first day back from this he had enjoyed his time cooking dinner now that he had more to work with. Even Asuka was pleasantly surprised by the dinner, and even ventured to ask Shinji why he knew so much about cooking, though his explanation might have been a little long for her tastes.

从那回来的第一天，他享受着用更多工具烹饪晚餐的乐趣。就连明日香也对晚餐感到惊喜，甚至好奇地问真嗣为什么对烹饪如此了解，尽管他的解释可能对她来说有点冗长。

The prospect of leaving the beach though, Shinji thought while sitting next to Asuka wasn't something that he had really considered. Certainly it was a possibility now that Asuka seemed to be able to walk, if rather slowly. But where would they go exactly? Leaving Tokyo-3 was assumed, but other than that he didn't really have an idea.

坐在明日香旁边的真嗣思考着离开海滩的可能性，他其实并没有真正考虑过。当然，现在明日香似乎能走路了，尽管很慢，但离开海滩是可能的。但他们究竟会去哪里呢？离开第三新东京市是必然的，但除此之外，他并没有具体的想法。

And Shinji didn't think that either of them were quite prepared for that journey. He looked sideways at Asuka then, watching her silently as the ocean wind calmly blew her hair out behind her. He preferred things like this if he had to be honest.

而真嗣并不认为他们中的任何一人已准备好踏上这段旅程。他侧目望向明日香，静静地注视着她，任由海风轻柔地吹拂起她的发丝。若要坦诚相待，他更偏爱这样的时刻。

"Well, I think I've had enough of the cold," said Asuka as she made to get up. Standing up seemed to be the most difficult part for Asuka, as her legs seemed to lose there strength if she kept them idle for too long, but once she was moving she was usually okay.

“好吧，我觉得我已经受够了这寒冷，”明日香说着准备起身。站起来对明日香来说似乎是最困难的部分，因为她的腿如果长时间不动就会失去力气，但一旦她开始移动，通常就没问题了。

Shinji stood up alongside her, which was probably a good thing as Asuka lost her balance slightly, and Shinji had to prevent her from falling. Still no word of thanks though escaped her lips.

真嗣也跟着她站起来，这可能是件好事，因为明日香稍稍失去了平衡，真嗣不得不防止她摔倒。不过，她嘴里还是没有说出感谢的话。

They walked back in silence, seeming to go faster then when they had walked out to the ocean. The fire was steadily roaring as they got back, and Shinji piled more dry wood on it. He was starting to have to walk much farther if he wanted wood that was usable.

他们默默地走回去，似乎比去海边时走得更快。当他们回来时，篝火正熊熊燃烧，真嗣又在上面加了一些干木头。如果他想找到可用的木头，现在不得不走得更远了。

Asuka predictably sat down and buried herself under the sleeping, shivering slightly from the cold while Shinji started working on dinner. He was just wondering what he should make when Asuka spoke to him.

正如预料的那样，明日香坐了下来，将自己埋在睡袋里，微微颤抖着抵御寒冷，而真嗣则开始准备晚餐。他正琢磨着该做些什么时，明日香开口对他说话了。

"Hey Shinji." “嘿，真嗣。”

"Huh?" he replied as he looked at the can of spam he held. He couldn't say he was a fan of the stuff, he had some seasoning which would help mask the taste.

“嗯？”他应声抬头，目光落在手中的午餐肉罐头上。他并不怎么喜欢这东西，但幸好有些调料能掩盖那味道。

"That place you found the food and sleeping bag at..."

"你找到食物和睡袋的那个地方……"

"What about it?" "那又怎样？"

"Did it have clothes as well?"

"那里也有衣服吗？"

Shinji had to think about this for a minute. Clothes were far from his mind if he was honest, even though the ones he was wearing couldn't have been in the best shape. But he did think he remembered seeing a section for them.

真嗣不得不花点时间思考这个问题。说实话，衣服远不在他的考虑范围内，尽管他现在穿的这些肯定状态不佳。但他确实记得似乎看到过有卖衣服的区域。

"Yeah I think there was," he replied.

“嗯，我想应该是有的，”他回答道。

"Could you go back there tomorrow and get me a few things?"

“你明天能回去帮我拿几件吗？”

"I guess..." he said rather offhandedly. Why did she suddenly want clothes?

"我想……" 他有些随意地说道。她怎么突然想要衣服了？

"Good, because this beach isn't the only thing I'm sick of."

"好，因为这个海滩不是我唯一厌倦的东西。"

It took a few seconds for it to click in Shinji's mind.

过了几秒钟，真嗣才反应过来。

"...That plug suit thing," he hesitated.

"...那件紧身衣，"他犹豫地说道。

"Now that I can walk okay I'd prefer to not be wearing this thing either. It prevents cold from seeping in well enough, but sleeping in it isn't very fun."

"既然我现在走路没问题，我也不想再穿这玩意儿了。它确实能很好地防止寒冷侵入，但穿着它睡觉可不怎么舒服。"

"I see," said Shinji after a few seconds.

“我明白了。”几秒钟后，真嗣说道。

Across the fire, Asuka was watching him with a blank stare on her face, though this stare quickly turned in a grin.

火堆对面，明日香面无表情地盯着他，但很快这表情就转变成了一个笑容。

"What's wrong, don't feel comfortable picking out clothes for a girl?"

“怎么了，给女孩子挑衣服不自在吗？”

"Thats not it," said Shinji at once, leaving little doubt that that was the case.

“不是那样的，”真嗣立刻说道，尽管这无疑就是事实。

Asuka almost laughed at his childish embarrassment.

明日香几乎要笑出声来，他的孩子气窘迫样子。

"Trust me, if I could walk there myself, I would, and not have to send you instead. Judging from what you're wearing, fashion isn't something you've ever heard of. I've never seen a more boring choice of clothes."

“相信我，如果我能自己走过去，我会的，不必派你代劳。看你这身打扮，时尚这词儿你恐怕听都没听过。我从没见过比这更乏味的衣着选择了。”

"What do you want there?" asked Shinji, trying to keep the bitterness out of his voice.

"你在那儿想要什么？" 真嗣问道，努力不让声音中流露出苦涩。

"Shirt, pants, sweatshirt, socks, and shoes. Nothing else." Asuka was was very adamant about this last part.

"衬衫，裤子，运动衫，袜子，还有鞋子。别的什么都没有。" 对于这最后一点，明日香非常坚持。

"Fine, I'll get them," said Shinji grumbling slightly.

"好吧，我去拿。" 真嗣略带抱怨地说道。

"Isn't dinner ready yet?"

"晚饭还没好吗？"

"You could help for a change."

"你也可以换换手帮忙。"

"Why? Its more fun watching," smirked Asuka.

"为什么？看热闹更有趣嘛，" 明日香微微一笑。

'Just because she can walk, she's acting all superior now,' thought Shinji as he threw several ingredients into the pot. He had eventually settled on a stew, as there wasn't anything else he could really make with the spam.

'就因为她能走路了，现在就摆出一副高高在上的样子，' 真嗣一边想，一边将几种食材扔进锅里。他最终决定做炖菜，因为除了午餐肉，他实在不知道还能做什么。

After another thirty minutes of cooking, the stew was done. They still had to eat out of the pot, as Shinji hadn't picked up any bowls, which reminded him he should look for dishes tomorrow when he returned to the store.

又过了三十分钟，炖菜做好了。他们还是得直接从锅里吃，因为真嗣没拿碗，这让他想起明天去商店时应该找找餐具。

They both finished up dinner and Shinji rinsed the pot and the forks that he had gotten before. Asuka was just complaining that she could use a shower when Shinji returned from the ocean and simply pointed towards it. Asuka glared at him but didn't say anything before she buried herself back under the sleeping bag. A shower would be good, but hot water was a bit of a commodity.

两人吃完晚餐后，真嗣清洗了之前拿来的锅和叉子。明日香正抱怨说她需要洗个澡，这时真嗣从海边回来，只是朝那边指了指。明日香瞪了他一眼，但什么也没说，就又钻回了睡袋里。洗个澡是不错，但热水可是稀缺资源。

Shinji lay down in his own sleeping bag, using his own arm as a pillow. He wasn't sure, and couldn't really explain it, but he felt like things would be changing slowly now. Rolling over onto his side, he closed his and went to sleep, dreading what tomorrow would bring.

真嗣躺进自己的睡袋，用胳膊当枕头。他不确定，也无法解释，但感觉事情会慢慢发生变化。翻身侧躺，他闭上眼睛，沉沉睡去，对明天将要发生的事感到忧虑。

Shinji had now spent so much time scrounging through cars and buildings that he was tempted to draw a map, but at the same time he seemed to have one in the back of his head. The department store was a good ways away from the beach, so certainly taking Asuka here so she could look at the clothes herself was out of the question, but he wished she would have given him a better idea of what she wanted. He didn't think that anything he'd chose she would really like to begin with.

真嗣已经花了太多时间在汽车和建筑物中搜寻，他甚至想画张地图，但同时他似乎脑子里已经有了一个。百货商店离海滩相当远，所以带明日香亲自来挑选衣服显然是不可能的，但他希望她能给他一个更明确的指示。他不认为他选的任何东西她会真的喜欢。

The store in question was off a highway it seemed, and was fairly well known, but Shinji didn't know the name of it. The sign out front had been crushed to fine dust it seemed. The parking lot was mildly large with many cars parked within the lot. These Shinji had gone through as well as he had first passed through. He had learned that it was best to check every possible place for anything useful, even if it was unlikely he'd find anything.

这家商店似乎位于一条高速公路旁，相当有名，但真嗣并不知道它的名字。门前的招牌似乎已被碾成细尘。停车场相当大，里面停着许多车。真嗣在第一次经过时也检查了这些车。他明白最好检查每一个可能的地方，寻找任何有用的东西，即使找到的可能性不大。

The store itself was pure white except for a thin blue strip that ran along the exterior of the building around the middle. The place had automated doors, but of course the power had been out. The exit door had been open though the first time Shinji had entered it, which made him wonder if somebody hadn't been leaving when...well when the disappeared. This was then only thing that made sense to him, even if everybody disappearing at once was unbelievable. But then again, so was everything that Asuka had told him.

商店本身是纯白色的，除了中间环绕建筑外部的一条细蓝带。这里有自动门，但当然电源已经断了。不过，真嗣第一次进入时，出口门是开着的，这让他怀疑是不是有人在……嗯，在消失的时候正要离开。这是唯一能让他理解的事情，即使所有人同时消失是难以置信的。但话说回来，明日香告诉他的所有事情也同样不可思议。

As he stepped into the department store he rubbed his arms as they were starting to chill. It was still earlier in the morning as Shinji had only left after he had made breakfast. Asuka was still sleeping before he had left, but he hoped she wouldn't be disgruntled by the cold oatmeal.

当他踏入百货商店时，他搓了搓手臂，因为它们开始感到寒冷。时间尚早，真嗣是在做完早餐后才离开的。明日香在他离开前还在熟睡，但他希望她不会因为冷掉的燕麦粥而生气。

He walked up and down the isles, passing the spot where he had gotten the sleeping bag and canned food. Eventually, he spied the clothing section at the back of the store and right beside it, the shoe section.

他在过道上来回踱步，经过了他买睡袋和罐头食品的地方。最终，他发现了商店后方的服装区，紧挨着的就是鞋区。

There wasn't much, as Shinji had suspected, but he walked up and down the isles looking at everything first. He was outside his element here, simple to say, and didn't have a clue what Asuka might actually like. He didn't relish the idea of being sent back only because she didn't like something he had chosen. Even so though, the store didn't have much in the way of clothes that he suspected she would like; the majority of the stuff was plain solid colors.

正如真嗣所料，这里的选择并不多，但他还是沿着过道来回走动，先看看所有的商品。简单来说，他对这里并不熟悉，完全不知道明日香可能会喜欢什么。他并不想因为选错了东西而被退回。尽管如此，商店里的衣服大多都是单调的纯色，他怀疑明日香不会喜欢。

While he was here though he decided that he may as well grab something for himself. This had nothing to do with what Asuka had told him yesterday he told himself. Finding a sweatshirt was at the forefront of his mind, and he did manage to find one. It was a little large for himself as he tried it on, but he couldn't really complain. He set this off to the side then as he looked through the rest of things.

尽管如此，他决定既然来了，不妨也为自己挑点什么。这与他昨天明日香告诉他的话无关，他告诉自己。他首先想到的是找一件运动衫，而且确实找到了一件。试穿时发现有点大，但他也没什么可抱怨的。他把这件放在一边，然后继续浏览其他商品。

Asuka had also asked for shoes, and since she hadn't told Shinji her shoe size, he had to guess this for the most part. He did decide to base it off his own size though, guessing that their feet couldn't be too different at their ages. He finally managed to settle on a pair of white running shoes. If she was going to continue this walking thing, then having running shoes would be best. He grabbed a package of socks as well that came with several, thinking that they could at least share these. His own socks where getting too worn out and each of them already had several holes.

明日香也要求了鞋子，由于她没有告诉真嗣她的鞋码，他大部分时间只能靠猜测。不过，他还是决定以自己的尺码为基准，猜测他们这个年龄段的脚大小应该不会相差太多。最终，他选定了一双白色的跑鞋。如果她打算继续这种步行方式，那么拥有一双跑鞋无疑是最佳选择。他还顺手拿了一包附带多双的袜子，心想至少这些他们可以共享。他自己的袜子已经磨损得厉害，每双都有好几个洞了。

Turning back to the clothes, he decided to just go with simplicity. He grabbed a pair of dark blue jeans that he hoped would fit her. Asuka was very slim from what he could tell, so they should fit. For a shirt, he grabbed a white t-shirt that had red stripes at the sleeves. Shinji rather guessed Asuka liked red; her current attire suggested it at least. And as for the sweatshirt, well, Shinji briefly thought about getting her the same white one he had grabbed himself, but he didn't think she'd like that. Eventually, he managed to find one that was solid red. It was close to the same size as his own, so it would probably be overlarge for her, but he supposed it could double as a pillow.

回头看向衣物，他决定选择简约风格。他抓起一条深蓝色牛仔裤，希望她能穿得上。从他的观察来看，明日香非常苗条，所以应该合适。至于上衣，他拿了一件白色 T 恤，袖子上有红色条纹。真嗣猜测明日香可能喜欢红色；至少她现在的装扮暗示了这一点。而说到运动衫，他短暂地考虑过给她拿自己拿的那件白色同款，但他觉得她不会喜欢。最终，他找到了一件纯红色的，尺寸与他自己的相近，对她来说可能会偏大，但他觉得可以当作枕头用。

Putting on the sweatshirt that he had chosen for himself, he slung the clothes over his shoulder and held the shoes with his hand. It felt weird to be walking out of the store with a bunch of clothes slung over his shoulder. The food and sleeping bag had been one thing, but not paying for all this stuff felt weird.

他穿上自己挑选的卫衣，将衣服搭在肩上，手里提着鞋子。肩上搭着一堆衣服走出商店的感觉很奇怪。食物和睡袋是一回事，但不付钱带走这些东西感觉很奇怪。

Walking back wasn't too difficult, and in what felt like a short time, Shinji was jogging down the hill that led to there makeshift camp.

走回去并不太难，感觉没过多久，真嗣就小跑着下了通往临时营地的小山。

Asuka was sitting up and eating the oatmeal that Shinji had left her and judging by her facial expressions, she wasn't enjoying the stone cold taste. This almost made Shinji laugh.

明日香正坐着吃真嗣留给她的燕麦粥，从她的面部表情判断，她并不喜欢这冰冷的口感。这几乎让真嗣笑出声来。

"Where did you go?" asked Asuka the minute Shinji walk up to her.

"你去哪儿了？" 真嗣一走近，明日香就问道。

"To get your clothes," said Shinji. He had forgotten how much he hated the idea when she had first asked him to do this, but in truth, it hadn't been that bad.

"去给你拿衣服，" 真嗣说。他曾忘记当初她第一次让他做这件事时，自己有多讨厌这个主意，但实际上，这并没有那么糟糕。

"Oh," mumbled Asuka as she looked at the clothes he had over his shoulder.

"哦，" 明日香咕哝着，目光落在他肩上搭着的衣服上。

'Still no word of thanks huh?' thought Shinji, but he wasn't really expecting anything.

“还是没听到一句感谢啊。”真嗣心想，但他其实也没指望什么。

"The oatmeal sucks by the way," grumbled Asuka as Shinji walked past her and grabbed a bottle of water, taking a sip of it.

“顺便说一句，那燕麦粥难吃死了，”明日香咕哝着，看着真嗣从她身边走过，拿起一瓶水喝了一口。

"Thats your fault for not waking up when I made it."

“那是你自己的错，谁叫你不早点起床。”

"You couldn't have just waited till I was up until you left?" Her voice was steadily beginning to rise.

“你就不能等到我起床再走吗？”她的声音逐渐升高。

"You're the one that asked me to. If you don't want them, I can just go take them back."

"是你让我拿的。如果你不想要，我可以直接拿回去。"

At this point, Asuka was looking daggers at him. Shinji didn't press his luck any further, but he thought her heard her hiss 'ass-hole' under her breath.

此时，明日香正用锐利的目光盯着他。真嗣没有再继续冒险，但他觉得他听到她低声咒骂了一句'混蛋'。

"Fine, give them here," said Asuka, her voice laced with venom still.

"好吧，把它们给我，"明日香说道，她的声音依然带着毒意。

Shinji dumped the clothes wordlessly into her outstretched arms and placed the shoes beside her. Asuka looked at them for a few moments before she said-

真嗣默默地将衣物扔进她伸出的双臂中，并将鞋子放在她旁边。明日香盯着它们看了片刻，然后说道——

"Well, it could have been worse I suppose," she said as she held up the t-shirt, her face rather passive. Shinji felt himself sigh with relief.

“嗯，我想情况可能更糟，”她一边说，一边举起 T 恤，脸上表情相当平静。这让真嗣松了一口气。

Turning around, he sat down on his own side of the fire just as Asuka said, "I see you picked yourself something as well." The anger in her voice had more or less disappeared by now.

他转过身，坐在火堆自己那一侧，正好听到明日香说：“看来你也给自己挑了点东西。”她声音中的怒气此时已消散了不少。

"A sweatshirt was something that I could use," said Shinji with a shrug.

“一件运动衫，我正好用得上。”真嗣耸耸肩说道。

Asuka looked as though she was itching to say something, but she kept her mouth closed. She continued looking at the clothes until she grimaced and said, "I want you to turn around."

明日香看起来很想说什么，但她紧闭着嘴。她继续盯着那些衣服，直到皱起眉头说：“我要你转过身去。”

If Shinji had been wise, he wouldn't have asked, but he hadn't thought what she implied.

如果真嗣足够明智，他本不会问出口，但他未曾细想她话中的深意。

"Why?" "为什么？"

"Because I told you to dumb ass," said Asuka with as much control as she could muster.

“因为我告诉过你，笨蛋，”明日香竭力控制着自己的语气说道。

Shinji continued looking at her for several seconds, his eyes going from the clothes, to Asuka's face which was slightly pink-

真嗣继续盯着她看了几秒钟，目光从衣服移到明日香微微泛红的脸上

'Oh,' he thought suddenly, his own face turning slightly pink.

“哦，”他突然想到，自己的脸颊微微泛红。

"Right sorry," he said hurriedly as he shifted his entire body so that he was face the other way.

“抱歉，”他急忙说着，整个身体转了过去，面朝另一个方向。

"If you look this way, I'll take a piece of this burned wood and clobber you over the head with it."

“如果你往这边看，我就拿这块烧焦的木头敲你的头。”

'You'd have to catch me first,' thought Shinji rather angrily, but he didn't retort.

“你得先抓到我。”真嗣有些生气地想，但他没有回嘴。

Asuka continued staring at his back for several seconds before she grimaced and turned away from him as well; no way in hell would she trust him.

明日香继续盯着他的背影几秒钟，然后皱起眉头，同样转身离开了他；她绝不会信任他。

Getting the plug suit off took more time that she had anticipated, especially while sitting down. It was a full body suit of course, and even though her legs were working somewhat now, it was still difficult. She had been in that damn thing for so long that she almost forgot what her own body felt like as she placed a hand against her bare chest. The cold air beat against her body, and she enjoyed this for several seconds until she felt a chill shake her body.

脱下插入栓服比她预想的要花更多时间，尤其是坐着的时候。这当然是一件全身套装，尽管她的腿现在有些知觉了，但仍然很困难。她在那该死的东西里待了太久，以至于几乎忘记了赤裸胸膛的感觉，当她把手放在胸前时。冷空气拍打在她的身体上，她享受了几秒钟，直到一阵寒意让她颤抖。

'Probably best to dress before I get sick again,' thought Asuka.

“最好在再次生病前穿上衣服，”明日香心想。

She first pulled the t-shirt over her body and padded it down looking at her chest. It wasn't tight, but she was still worried about a certain problem. The sweatshirt would fix that probably though. The jeans were almost her exact waist size, and she was admittedly surprised and creeped out at the same time that Shinji had got it right. As she pulled the sweatshirt over her head though, she let out a sigh, enjoying the warmth that it guaranteed. The plug suit was fine, but actually wearing cotton clothes always felt nicer. And the sweatshirt did a good job in keeping her warm.

她首先将 T 恤套在身上，整理了一下，看着自己的胸部。虽然不算紧绷，但她仍对某个问题感到担忧。不过，套头衫或许能解决这个问题。牛仔裤的腰围几乎与她的完全吻合，她不禁既惊讶又觉得有些毛骨悚然，因为真嗣竟然猜对了尺寸。当她将套头衫套在头上时，她叹了口气，享受着它带来的温暖。插入栓服虽然不错，但穿上棉质衣物总是感觉更舒适。而且，套头衫确实很好地保暖了。

She looked down at herself then. It may not have been the clothes she would have chosen, but it wasn't terrible either.

她低头看了看自己。虽然这些衣服不是她会自己选择的，但也不算糟糕。

She turned around then, and saw that Shinji was still looking away from her.

她转过身，看到真嗣仍然背对着她。

'Well he's either a coward or honest to a fault,' thought Asuka snidely.

“哼，他要么是个懦夫，要么就是诚实得过分。”明日香尖刻地想道。

"You can turn around now," said Asuka.

"你现在可以转过身来了," 明日香说道。

Shinji did so, though very slowly as though he couldn't trust Asuka's own words. As he did so, he saw that she had pulled on her socks, but was having trouble getting the shoes on.

真嗣照做了，尽管动作非常缓慢，仿佛无法相信明日香的话。当他转身时，他看到她已经穿上了袜子，但正在费力地穿鞋。

"Are they too small?" asked Shinji quietly as he watched her struggle.

"是不是太小了？" 真嗣轻声问道，看着她挣扎的样子。

"Too big," said Asuka, "but that shouldn't be a problem. My...feet...won't..."

"太大了，" 明日香说，"但这应该不是问题。我的...脚...不会..."

Shinji watched her struggle for several more seconds before he sighed and stood up, walking over to her.

真嗣又看了她挣扎了几秒钟，然后叹了口气站起来，走过去帮她。

"What?" asked Asuka bluntly as Shinji sat down next to her.

“什么？”明日香直截了当地问，此时真嗣在她旁边坐下。

"Give them here," he said.

“把它们给我。”他说。

"You're not dressing me," she said stubbornly.

"你别想给我穿衣服，"她固执地说。

"There just shoes," he replied.

"只是鞋子而已，"他回答道。

"I don't care," said Asuka as she shook her head. She was obviously troubled that she couldn't even do this.

"我不在乎，"明日香摇着头说。她显然因为连这点小事都做不到而感到困扰。

She did relent eventually, and Shinji took the shoe and examined it for a brief second before her took Asuka's foot, and gently slid it into the shoe. Shinji could feel her steadily growing angrier next to him as he laced them up as well. Something she had such difficult with, he had done in a second.

她最终还是让步了，真嗣接过鞋子，短暂地检查了一下，然后握住明日香的一只脚，轻轻地将其滑入鞋中。真嗣能感觉到她在他身边越来越生气，因为他还迅速地系好了鞋带。这件事她一直很难做到，他却一瞬间就完成了。

"Next," said Shinji. “下一个，”真嗣说道。

Asuka raised her other foot, but Shinji had a feeling she would have rather planted it in his face.

明日香抬起了另一只脚，但真嗣有种感觉，她更愿意将它踩在他的脸上。

He laced the other one up without much difficulty either, and then he helped her stand up so she could get a feel. She was wobbly at first, but got her balance and quickly walked slowly around, testing out the feel of the shoes.

他同样没费多大劲就系好了另一只鞋，然后帮她站起来，让她感受一下。起初她有些摇晃，但很快就找到了平衡，慢慢地绕着圈子走，试探着鞋子的感觉。

"How is it?" asked Shinji as he walked beside to her.

“感觉怎么样？”真嗣陪在她身边问道。

"A lot different than walking in the plug suit."

“和穿着插入栓服走路大不一样。”

This somewhat surprised Shinji.

这让真嗣有些意外。

"How come?" “怎么会？”

"The plug suit is a full body suit first off...so theres that, and the shoes feel much closer to just wearing socks than actual shoes. Its a little...awkward at first I guess."

“首先，插入栓服是全身套装...所以有那个感觉，而且鞋子穿起来更像是只穿了袜子而不是真正的鞋子。一开始有点...尴尬吧。”

"Well...you got it quickly." said Shinji.

"嗯...你学得挺快的。" 真嗣说道。

"Of course I did," said Asuka as she glanced at him.

"当然啦，" 明日香瞥了他一眼说道。

They walked a few times around the fire until Asuka got tired and sat back down. After that, Shinji started making dinner.

他们围着篝火走了几圈，直到明日香累了坐回地上。之后，真嗣开始准备晚餐。

After finishing, they both laid down on there respective sides of the sleeping bag and were silent for a while until Shinji broached something that he had been thinking about since yesterday.

完事后，两人各自躺在睡袋的一侧，沉默了一会儿，直到真嗣提起昨天以来一直在思考的事情。

"Asuka...yesterday you said that you had grown sick of Tokyo-3. I have too, but honestly, where else would we go?"

“明日香……昨天你说对第三新东京市感到厌倦了。我也是，但说实话，我们还能去哪儿呢？”

"How should I know." "我怎么知道。"

"You don't have anywhere else you want to go?"

"你没有其他想去的地方吗？"

"Not that I could think off...I'm just not sure. Why do you?"

"我想不出来...我只是不确定。你呢？"

"Maybe...the other side of the valley...where I was before."

"或许...山谷的另一边...我之前所在的地方。"

Asuka knew what he meant, but didn't want to think about that. She didn't want to think about those times.

明日香明白他的意思，但她不想去想那些事。她不想回忆那些时光。

"I don't want to talk about that right now," said Asuka as she turned away from him, away from the fire. Though as she did this, something caught Shinji's eye. He thought it was just her hair, but he noticed those things she had clipped to her hair. She had told him about them before, but he couldn't remember what they were called.

"我现在不想谈这个，"明日香说着，转身背对着他，也背对着火堆。然而就在这时，有什么东西引起了真嗣的注意。他原以为是她的头发，但随后注意到她发间夹着的那些小饰品。她之前跟他提过，但他记不清它们叫什么了。

"How come you're still wearing those things?" Shinji asked without much delicacy.

“你怎么还穿着那些东西？”真嗣不太客气地问道。

"What things?" asked Asuka tonelessly.

“什么事？”明日香无动于衷地问。

"Those things in your hair."

“你头发里的那些东西。”

Asuka turned back towards and stared wordlessly at him for a few seconds.

明日香转过身来，默默地盯着他几秒钟。

"I thought that you would have taken them off when you changed out of the plug suit. You said you were sick of it before so-"

“我以为你换下插入栓服的时候会脱掉它们。你之前不是说厌倦了吗——”

"These remind me of who I am," said Asuka as she cut him off.

“这些让我记得我是谁，”明日香打断了他。

"Who you are?" asked Shinji confused.

"你是谁？" 真嗣困惑地问道。

Asuka didn't reply but sat up, letting the sleeping bag slide off of her. She had removed the sweatshirt and was using it as a pillow now.

明日香没有回答，只是坐起身来，让睡袋从她身上滑落。她已经脱掉了运动衫，现在正用它当枕头。

"I'm an Evangelion pilot, the Second Child, and part of Nerv whose duty it is to defeat the angels."

"我是福音战士驾驶员，第二适格者，隶属于 NERV，职责是击败使徒。"

"Isn't that in the past now though?"

"那不是已经成为过去了吗？"

"I suppose it is," said Asuka. "But these things..." she mumbled as she placed a hand over the A-10 nerve receptors, "they made who I am."

"我想是的，" 明日香说道，"但这些……" 她喃喃自语，将手放在 A-10 神经感受器上，"它们塑造了现在的我。"

Shinji couldn't understand this however. So then...what was Asuka before she became an Evangelion pilot?

真嗣无法理解这一点。那么……在成为 EVA 驾驶员之前，明日香又是谁呢？

"Are you that attached to them?"

"你真的那么依赖它们吗？"

"Is that so wrong?" snapped Asuka.

“这样有错吗？”明日香厉声反问。

"I don't think its wrong," said Shinji as he shook his head. 'But it makes you sound like you don't have a purpose anymore,' he thought silently.

“我不觉得有错，”真嗣摇头说道，‘但那会让你听起来好像失去了存在的意义，’他默默地想。

Asuka watched him; she seemed unsure of herself. Or maybe she was unsure about leaving Tokyo-3. Maybe she was afraid that if she left, everything that she had existed to do would have been for naught. She had been an Evangelion pilot, but not once had she ever fought the angels. Wasn't that just a waste of an existence? A waste of her time in college? What had she been doing all this time then?

明日香注视着他，显得有些犹豫不决。或许她对离开第三新东京市心存疑虑。也许她害怕一旦离开，她为之存在的一切都将化为泡影。她曾是 EVA 驾驶员，却从未与使徒战斗过。这样的存在岂不是一种浪费？她在大学里的时光岂不是白费？那她这段时间究竟在做什么呢？

"Go to sleep Shinji," Asuka said.

“去睡吧，真嗣，”明日香说道。

While Asuka found this easy to do, Shinji had more difficulty as he lay awake thinking about Asuka. She was still unwillingly to open up about herself, and Shinji had a feeling there were several reasons for that. If being an Evangelion pilot had meant everything to her, he could understand why she didn't want to throw those things away. It was a relic of who she was, what she had been. At the same time, it was sad to see her depressed like that.

虽然明日香觉得这很容易做到，但真嗣却难以入眠，他躺在床上想着明日香。她仍然不愿意敞开心扉，真嗣感觉这其中有许多原因。如果成为 EVA 驾驶员对她意味着一切，他可以理解她为何不愿放弃这些。这是她身份的遗迹，是她曾经的样子。与此同时，看到她那样沮丧也令人难过。

During there time together, Shinji had grown used to Asuka to the extent that he could say he wasn't bothered by her company anymore. He could even go so far as to say they were friends, though he wasn't sure if thats how Asuka viewed him as well.

在他们相处的这段时间里，真嗣已经习惯了明日香，甚至可以说他不再介意她的陪伴。他甚至可以大胆地说他们是朋友，尽管他不确定明日香是否也这样看待他。

He had a feeling though, that her guard might have been cracked slightly. She seemed unsure about what she wanted to do. Now that she could walk, she wasn't as helpless, nor tying them down to the beach anymore. But Shinji could also tell that she didn't want to leave Tokyo-3, even though she said what she said. She was waring with herself internally.

他有种感觉，她的防线可能已经稍稍松动了。她似乎不确定自己想要做什么。现在她能走路了，不再那么无助，也不再拖累他们在海滩上了。但真嗣也能看出，她并不想离开第三新东京市，尽管她说了那样的话。她在内心挣扎着。

Shinji could wait certainly, but for how long? When would she be ready? He didn't want to push her. The last thing he needed was the Asuka that he had first met on the beach who had tried to kill him.

真嗣当然可以等待，但能等多久呢？她什么时候才会准备好？他不想逼她。他最不需要的就是在海滩上第一次遇到的那个试图杀死他的明日香。

Even so, staying here forever wasn't going to do anything.

即便如此，永远留在这里也解决不了任何问题。

Shinji rolled over onto his side and faced the fire, staring across it to Asuka.

真嗣侧身躺下，面向火堆，凝视着对面的明日香。

What did he want as well? There were still many things that Shinji didn't know that asking that question of himself just seemed plain stupid.

他到底还想要什么呢？真嗣仍有许多未知，以至于向自己提出这个问题显得相当愚蠢。

He rolled back onto his back and closed his eyes, trying to fall asleep, forgetting about what Asuka had told him about earlier. Whenever she was ready to talk, Shinji would be there to listen.

他翻身仰躺，闭上眼睛，试图入睡，忘记了明日香之前告诉他的事情。无论何时她准备好倾诉，真嗣都会在那里聆听。

As he thought this, he slowly fell asleep, while above him, the clouds above Tokyo-3 started to darken.

正当他这么想着，他渐渐进入了梦乡，而头顶上，东京-3 上空的云层开始变得阴沉。

### Chapter 6: Remembrance

Right so I'm really drunk right now so ignore any typing problems right now. This chapter is...well something that had to happen sooner or later I guess, and the sooner the better. Getting it out the of the way, Shinji and Asuka can continue there lives as so at least. Trying to do one chapter a month at least as well.

好吧，我现在真的醉了，所以忽略任何打字问题。这个chapter是……嗯，我想迟早得发生的事，越早越好。把它解决了，真嗣和明日香才能继续他们的生活。至少试着每个月写一篇chapter。

On another note, no idea whether I'll do a one shot for Valentines Day. Probably not in all likely hood, but on my birthday (March 10th), maybe we'll see something. I'm thinking birthday themed I guess, go figure, as I haven't done something like that before.

另外，不知道会不会为情人节写一篇短篇。很可能不会，但我的生日（3 月 10 日）可能会写点什么。我想可能是生日主题的，毕竟我以前没写过类似的东西。

It was the rain that started first.

首先是雨开始了。

Looking back on the previous week, Shinji was surprised at how lucky they had been. No more it seemed.

回顾上一周，真嗣惊讶于他们的幸运程度。看来不会再有了。

A storm was passing overhead, the winds billowing and screeching so loudly that Shinji thought God himself was screaming at them. The waves roared against the shore, and blew the spray from the water towards them. Not that the rain wasn't already doing that.

一场风暴正从头顶经过，狂风呼啸，尖叫声之大，真嗣以为上帝本人在向他们咆哮。海浪咆哮着冲击海岸，将水花吹向他们。不过，雨水已经在做同样的事了。

Shinji awoke quickly at the start of this, and immediately went to the fire which had died down during the night. It was nigh on impossible to get it started again though with the wet wood and Shinji found himself giving up quickly.

真嗣在这开始时迅速醒来，立刻走向那夜幕中已熄灭的篝火。然而，湿木头使得重新点燃它几乎不可能，真嗣很快便放弃了尝试。

The wind continued roaring as Shinji made his way back to his sleeping bag which had been blown several feet away. He gathered it up, cursing the wind and rain as he walked, and grabbed the sweatshirt he had gotten. Throwing it over his head, he made his way back to the dead fire. It was at this point that Asuka decided to voice her opinion.

风继续咆哮着，真嗣回到被吹出几英尺远的睡袋旁。他收拾好睡袋，一边咒骂着风和雨，一边拿起他得到的运动衫。他套上运动衫，再次走向那熄灭的篝火。就在这时，明日香决定表达她的看法。

"What the fuck is going on?"

“搞什么鬼？”

Her voice came over the wind as though it was a whisper, and Shinji could barely hear her. He could only guess at how pissed she was though.

她的声音随风飘来，仿佛耳语一般，真嗣几乎听不清。他只能猜测她有多生气。

The storm raged on through most of the night and the wind continued to howl, making conversation all but impossible unless they were right next to each other. Shinji didn't bother testing this though, as he assumed Asuka was in no mood. He wasn't very happy himself.

风暴肆虐了大半个夜晚，风继续咆哮着，使得交谈几乎不可能，除非他们紧挨着彼此。真嗣没有尝试这样做，因为他猜想明日香心情不佳。他自己也不太高兴。

Wet and tired was how they spent much of that night, and only when morning came did the rain relent, but the wind continued to beat against the beach. Thankful for this much though, they both were able to get a few extra hours of sleep until Shinji woke up.

那个夜晚，他们大多时候都湿漉漉又疲惫不堪，直到早晨雨势才有所减弱，但风依旧拍打着海滩。尽管如此，他们还是感激地多睡了几个小时，直到真嗣醒来。

He didn't have much hope in getting a fire started, and only tried halfheartedly, until he gave up, and they had to dine on uncooked oatmeal, which was little different than slop. Though she didn't speak, Shinji heard Asuka grumbling under her breath about the sudden shift in living conditions.

他对生火没抱太大希望，只是敷衍地试了试，最后还是放弃了，他们只能吃着未煮的燕麦，这跟猪食也没多大差别。尽管她没说话，但真嗣听到了明日香低声抱怨生活条件的突然变化。

They had been lucky to have the weather on there side for a while, but it seemed that there luck had run out. Shinji in particular was worried that the cold and rain might send Asuka spiraling back into a condition he didn't want to see her in. That and her legs would certainly start to seize up again.

他们曾一度幸运地拥有好天气，但似乎这份好运已经耗尽。特别是真嗣，他担心寒冷和雨水可能会让明日香再次陷入他不愿见到的状态。此外，她的双腿肯定也会再次抽筋。

So, because of those thoughts, he spent most of that morning searching for anything that he could use to get a fire started, going so far as to break into a car where he saw several magazines on the floor. Without anything to keep the fire going though, the paper wouldn't last very long. Then again, even if he did manage to get the fire going, it would be blown out by the wind almost certainly. The clouds above Tokyo-3 still hadn't left, and Shinji was only waiting to feel droplets of rain on his face again.

因此，出于这些考虑，那天早上他大部分时间都在寻找任何可以用来生火的东西，甚至不惜闯入一辆车里，因为他看到地板上有几本杂志。然而，没有东西维持火势，纸张不会持续太久。再者，即使他设法点燃了火，也很可能会被风吹灭。东京-3 上空的云层仍未散去，真嗣只是在等待再次感受到脸上的雨滴。

As the morning disappeared though, the rain started to slowly return, and all too quickly, the magazines that Shinji had painstakingly found were soaked through. Asuka was in no mood for this sudden realization that they would be without fire again, and found it proper to berate Shinji because of this. They both argued back and forth over the dead fire as the rain came down around them.

然而，随着早晨的消逝，雨又开始慢慢回来，而且快得让人措手不及，真嗣费尽心思找到的杂志全都被浸透了。明日香对此突如其来的现实——他们又将没有火——毫无心情，觉得有必要因此责骂真嗣。他们围绕着熄灭的火堆争论不休，雨水在他们周围落下。

Dinner was even more lackluster than breakfast, and halfway through, Asuka threw the entire contents of the pot across the beach from where she sat, and started cursing wildly. Shinji would have liked to say a few things himself, even if they would have been directed at Asuka. However, he silently grabbed the pot that she had flung and brought it back to the camp.

晚餐比早餐还要乏味，吃到一半，明日香就把整锅食物从她坐的地方扔到了海滩上，开始疯狂咒骂。真嗣本想说几句，哪怕是对着明日香。然而，他默默地捡起她扔掉的锅，带回了营地。

They both lay in there sleeping bags miserable again that night and the rain poured down around them. Shinji's sleeping bag was so wet to the point that with or without it wouldn't have made much of a difference. Asuka on the other hand had completely zipped her sleeping bag up so that not even her head was poking out. Shinji didn't think that was helping much though, and sure enough, Asuka's poked out as she gasped for fresh air.

那晚，他们俩又躺在睡袋里，心情沮丧，雨水倾盆而下。真嗣的睡袋湿透了，无论是否使用，都没什么区别。而明日香则完全拉上了睡袋的拉链，连头都没露出来。真嗣觉得这没什么用，果然，明日香的头探了出来，她喘着气寻求新鲜空气。

"When the fuck is this ever going to let up?" yelled Asuka, more to the sky than at Shinji.

“这他妈到底什么时候才能消停？”明日香对着天空吼道，与其说是在对真嗣说，不如说更像是在对天发泄。

'Not anytime soon from the look of things,' thought Shinji, but he had other problems he was worried about.

'看样子不会很快好转，' 真嗣心想，但他还有其他担忧的问题。

"How is your leg?" he asked.

"你的腿怎么样了？" 他问道。

"How the fuck do you think it is?" shouted Asuka. "It's freezing."

"你觉得呢？" 明日香吼道，"冷得要命。"

'Not good,' thought Shinji. 'If this cold doesn't relent soon...'

“情况不妙，”真嗣心想，“如果这股寒流还不减弱……”

Shinji left his thought hanging, not willing to think where it might lead. But surely the storm couldn't continue on like this.

真嗣没有继续想下去，不愿去想可能导致的后果。但这场风暴肯定不会一直这样持续下去。

He was maybe partially right.

他或许部分说对了。

At some point past midnight, they both managed to fall asleep, but that was when the first bout of thunder started. It woke them up so suddenly that Shinji at first thought that his ear drums had ruptured. He stood up, and very nearly fell over as a gust of wind struck him, almost knocking him backwards. The thunder roared again, almost sounding as though giants were fighting in the city.

午夜过后某个时刻，他们俩终于设法入睡了，但就在这时第一阵雷声开始了。雷声如此突然地将他们惊醒，以至于真嗣起初以为自己的耳膜破裂了。他站起身来，几乎被一阵狂风击倒，差点被吹得向后倒去。雷声再次轰鸣，听起来几乎像是巨人在城市中战斗。

Shinji didn't see any other choice then what the one he had thought of earlier. He had no idea how long the storm would last, and waiting it out could be a problem, and Asuka may not make it through another night.

真嗣那时没有其他选择，只能采取他之前想到的办法。他不知道这场风暴会持续多久，等待它过去可能是个问题，而明日香可能撑不过另一个夜晚。

Throwing the sweatshirt over his already soaked shirt, he battled his way towards Asuka, feeling as though he was fighting against a giant hand that was pressing against him.

他将运动衫套在已经湿透的衬衫上，艰难地向明日香走去，感觉自己仿佛在与一只巨大的手掌对抗，那手掌正压迫着他。

"Asuka! Get up! Now!" "明日香！起来！马上！"

Shinji could barely hear his own voice as the thunder sounded again, but he didn't think Asuka couldn't have heard him. Even so, she didn't make any move to get up.

真嗣几乎听不清自己的声音，因为雷声再次响起，但他不认为明日香会听不见。即便如此，她也没有任何起身的动作。

"Asuka! We have to get out of the storm for a while! C'mon!"

"明日香！我们得暂时离开这场暴风雨！快点！"

Shinji shouted again, this time with more force in his voice. Asuka still didn't move, and Shinji was starting to grow worried. The thunder exploded again, and a flash of lightning streaked across the sky, lighting up the entire world for a brief instance.

真嗣再次大喊，这次他的声音中带着更多的力量。明日香仍然一动不动，真嗣开始感到担忧。雷声再次炸响，一道闪电划过天空，短暂地照亮了整个世界。

Getting down on his knees, Shinji forcefully unzipped the sleeping bag and was surprised to see Asuka curled up under it with her eyes tightly shut. This scared him even more for some reason.

真嗣跪下身来，用力拉开睡袋的拉链，惊讶地发现明日香蜷缩在里面，双眼紧闭。不知为何，这让他更加害怕。

"Asuka, we have to move!"

"明日香，我们得动身了！"

She still didn't reply, or even shake her head. She didn't give any sign of moving, but she seemed to be trembling slightly. What the hell was wrong with her?

她依旧没有回应，甚至没有摇头。她没有任何移动的迹象，但似乎在微微颤抖。她到底怎么了？

"Asuka, move!" yelled Shinji, almost directly next to her face.

"明日香，快动！" 真嗣几乎是对着她的脸大喊道。

"No," she finally whispered through half closed lips.

“不，”她终于半闭着嘴唇低声说道。

This was too much for Shinji. After hearing her praise herself constantly when she herself had done absolutely nothing, Shinji was fed up with her attitude. Forcefully grabbing her arm from inside the sleeping bag, he pulled her out of. Her body was cold to the touch and limp. Was the cold sapping her strength?

这对真嗣来说太过分了。听到她不停地自夸，而她自己却什么也没做，真嗣对她这种态度感到厌烦。他强行从睡袋里抓住她的手臂，将她拉了出来。她的身体触感冰冷且无力。是寒冷在消耗她的力量吗？

He stood her upright, angry at how stubborn she was being. This was completely different from before. If she didn't move, then Shinji would drag her to shelter if he had to. He was not leaving her again.

他让她站直，对她的固执感到恼火。这与之前完全不同。如果她不动，那么必要时真嗣会拖着她去避难。他不会再丢下她了。

"Asuka, we have move. This storm won't be subsiding soon. We need to find shelter."

"明日香，我们得转移了。这场风暴不会很快减弱。我们需要找个避难所。"

"No," she whispered again.

“不，”她再次低声说道。

Shinji was so pissed at her that he almost hit her, though he restrained himself. Couldn't she understand that he was scared for her sake?

真嗣对她气得几乎要动手，尽管他还是克制住了自己。难道她就不能理解他是为了她而感到害怕吗？

"Asuka...listen to me," tried Shinji calmly. "The way this weather is...your leg wont be getting better. It will be getting worse." Shinji felt like he was talking to a child.

"Asuka...听我说，" 真嗣平静地尝试着，"这样的天气...你的腿不会好转的。情况只会越来越糟。" 真嗣感觉自己像是在跟一个孩子说话。

"So we have to get out of here," he finished.

"所以我们必须离开这里，"他总结道。

"No," she said again. "不，"她再次说道。

Shinji angrily grabbed her shoulders then, and shook her none to gently.

真嗣愤怒地抓住她的肩膀，用力摇晃着她。

"Asuka!" he yelled at her. "We have to fucking move!"

"明日香！" 他朝她吼道，"我们他妈的得动起来！"

"NO!" she screamed back at him, yanking away from his grasp. She turned around quickly, and before Shinji could do anything, she took several steps away from him, and then fell backwards onto her sleeping bag and pulled it around herself.

"不！" 她尖叫着回应他，猛地挣脱他的手。她迅速转身，还没等真嗣反应过来，她就快步远离他，然后向后倒在自己的睡袋上，拉过睡袋裹住自己。

Shinji stared back at her, awestruck. What the hell had happened to her?

真嗣目瞪口呆地看着她。她到底怎么了？

That was when he got a look at her face. Asuka was soaked just as he was. Her hair hung in great lumps around her face, shielding it mostly from view, but as Shinji looked closely, he noticed water streaking down her face that he didn't think was from the rain.

就在那时，他看清了她的脸。明日香和他一样浑身湿透，头发成团地贴在脸上，大部分面容被遮挡，但当真嗣仔细观察时，他注意到她脸上流淌的水迹，他觉得那不像是雨水。

Was Asuka crying? 明日香在哭吗？

This surprised Shinji so much that he didn't even flinch when the thunder rolled overhead again.

这令真嗣如此惊讶，以至于当头顶再次响起雷声时，他甚至没有退缩。

Asuka was crying. 明日香在哭泣。

Was it because of the rain from before, when she was sick? Or was it something else?

是因为之前生病时的那场雨吗？还是其他什么原因？

Shinji didn't know what to do. What could he do? Asuka never cried, Shinji knew that just from watching how she acted. So why was it that she was crying now? Was it the thunder that scared her? It scared him too, but crying over it was...unlike Asuka as he knew her.

真嗣不知道该怎么办。他能做什么呢？明日香从不哭泣，真嗣仅从她的行为就能看出这一点。那么为什么她现在在哭呢？是因为雷声吓到她了吗？雷声也吓到了他，但为此哭泣……不像他所认识的明日香。

Something else...it had to have been.

一定有别的原因……

'...A dream?' thought Shinji suddenly. If she had been dreaming, and it wasn't a very pleasant dream, and then the thunder...

'……一个梦？'真嗣突然想到。如果她做了梦，而且不是一个愉快的梦，再加上雷声……

"Is that it? Were you dreaming?" Shinji asked Asuka as he looked down at her. She didn't give any recognition to this.

“就这些吗？你在做梦吗？”真嗣低头看着明日香问道。她对此没有任何反应。

Shinji felt bad for his rudeness to her earlier now.

真嗣现在为自己之前的粗鲁感到内疚。

Kneeling down in front of her, Shinji looked past the tangle of hair surrounding her face to her eyes. There were droplets of water at the corners of them, and this solidified his thought.

真嗣跪在她面前，透过她脸上凌乱的发丝看向她的眼睛。眼角挂着水珠，这让他更加确信。

"Asuka..." Shinji began, but she very abruptly shook her head and mumbled-

"明日香..." 真嗣开口道，但她非常突然地摇了摇头，咕哝着——

"Leave me alone." "别管我。"

'Remember what happened the last time I left you alone?' thought Shinji. He wasn't about to repeat the same mistakes.

‘记得上次我把你一个人留下时发生了什么吗？’ 真嗣心想。他不会再重蹈覆辙了。

"I'm not going to leave you alone," said Shinji quietly.

“我不会让你一个人了，” 真嗣平静地说。

Asuka looked back at him then, anger clear on her stricken face. She was torn in two right now. Her hatred over seeming helpless and whatever had scared her so was ripping her apart. And Shinji was viewing it all. She hated it.

明日香回头看着他，脸上明显带着愤怒。她此刻内心矛盾重重。她对无助感的憎恨以及那让她如此恐惧的东西正在将她撕裂。而真嗣正目睹这一切。她对此深恶痛绝。

"Not like before," Shinji said.

“不像以前那样了。” 真嗣说道。

"Because you can't live with the guilt?" asked Asuka mocking him, though she was choking on the words.

"因为你无法承受那份愧疚？" 明日香嘲讽地问他，尽管她的话语中带着哽咽。

"If I abandoned you again, what would that make me? The lowest person ever? If I felt guilty for letting a friend die while I did nothing to prevent it, then fine, call it guilt. I haven't had many people I've been able to call friends in the first place, or people I've even been able to talk to"

"如果我再次抛弃你，那我算什么？史上最卑鄙的人吗？如果我对眼睁睁看着朋友死去却无所作为感到内疚，那就随你叫它内疚吧。我本来就没有多少可以称之为朋友的人，甚至连能交谈的人都不多。"

Asuka hesitated as he spoke the word friend. They were simply in this pile of shit together. Friendship was something else.

当他说出“朋友”这个词时，明日香犹豫了。他们只是共同陷入了这堆烂摊子。友谊是另一回事。

"Friends are..." started Asuka.

"朋友是..." 明日香开口道。

"Whether you think of me that way as well, thats your decision. Sure, things suck. We never seem to be able to agree on any one damn thing, but I'm not gonna say that I dislike being around you Asuka."

"无论你是否也那样看待我，那是你的决定。当然，事情很糟糕。我们似乎永远无法就任何一件事达成一致，但我不会说我不喜欢和你在一起，明日香。"

This caught Asuka off guard, and she momentarily forgot about her dream.

这让明日香措手不及，她暂时忘记了她的梦。

"We don't have any choice but to take shelter until this thing blows over. So we need to start moving."

"我们别无选择，只能找个地方避一避，直到这阵风波过去。所以我们需要开始行动了。"

Asuka watched him from behind her tangle of hair. Her eyes felt incredibly bloodshot and she was tired from lack of sleep. But she pushed everything to the back of her mind and stood up slowly. Her head hurt, the thunder was giving her a headache, and images kept on flashing in her mind, things she had kept buried. But that was then, and this was now.

明日香透过她纠结的发丝注视着他。她的眼睛红得厉害，因缺乏睡眠而疲惫不堪。但她将一切思绪推至脑海深处，缓缓站起身来。她的头很痛，雷声让她头疼欲裂，那些被她深埋的记忆不断在脑海中闪现。但那是过去，而现在已是现在。

She didn't say anything, and continued to avert her gaze from Shinji, but he was looking directly at her. On a normal day, she would have probably hit him by now.

她没有说话，继续避开真嗣的目光，但他却直直地看着她。换作平常日子，她可能早就揍他了。

The thunder boomed again, and they both flinched, aware again of the situation they were in.

雷声再次轰鸣，两人都吓了一跳，再次意识到他们所处的境况。

"We need to get moving," said Shinji.

"我们得动身了，" 真嗣说道。

"Right," said Asuka quietly, still not looking at him. Though as she took one step forward, pain seared in her right ankle, and she stumbled forward, only to be caught by Shinji. His face was laced with fear.

"好的，" 明日香轻声回应，依旧没有看向他。然而，当她向前迈出一步时，右脚踝的剧痛突然袭来，她踉跄向前，被真嗣及时扶住。他的脸上满是担忧。

"What is it? Your leg?"

"怎么了？是腿吗？"

"Its my ankle...I think I twisted something when I fell backwards," said Asuka, feeling even more helpless and now incredibly stupid. Why had she reacted so badly to the dream and thunder? Thunder had never particularly scared her, or maybe it was the fear of death she was feeling again.

“是我的脚踝……我想我摔倒时扭到了什么，”明日香说道，感到更加无助，现在还觉得自己愚蠢至极。为什么她会对那个梦和雷声反应如此糟糕？雷声从未特别吓到过她，或许是因为她再次感受到了对死亡的恐惧。

Shinji looked at her for several seconds, before her turned around and bent down saying, "nothing we can do about it. I'll have to carry you then."

真嗣看了她几秒钟，然后转过身弯下腰说：“没办法了。那我只好背你了。”

"What!?" she replied, "I'd rather walk with this bad ankle then-"

“什么！？”她回答，“我宁愿瘸着脚走——”

"Asuka...for once, please just shut up and do this. I'm not gonna have you fall over backwards if you try to climb that hill."

“明日香...就这一次，请闭上嘴照做吧。我可不想你试着爬那座山时摔个四脚朝天。”

"And if you fall backwards while carrying me?" she snapped back at him, regaining some of her flare.

"如果背着我的时候你摔倒了怎么办？" 她厉声回敬，恢复了几分往日的风采。

"Then I'll be sure to fall face first," said Shinji without a hitch in his voice. "Now hurry up."

"那我一定会脸先着地，" 真嗣毫不犹豫地说道，"现在快点吧。"

Asuka stood silently as she watched Shinji bend down with his arms held out behind him. Anything, anything else would have been better then having to degrade herself by letting Shinji carry her. She would have almost rather have stayed here.

明日香静静地站着，看着真嗣弯下腰，双臂向后伸出。任何事情，任何其他选择都比让她屈尊让真嗣背要好。她几乎宁愿留在这里。

Slowly though, she started walking towards him until she was standing directly behind him. Placing a hand wordlessly on his shoulders, she held it there for several seconds until she brought the other hand up, and together, wrapped them both around Shinji's neck. Wordlessly, he then grabbed both her legs and lifted her slowly off the ground, forcing Asuka's chest against his back. Shinji was aware of this, but let it slip his mind. There was certainly something there, even if it was relatively small. Asuka wrapped her arms tighter around Shinji, clinging on as if she was a child. She felt embarrassed but supposed the worst was over. And Shinji's words about enjoying being around her was still ringing in her ears.

然而，她开始缓缓地向他走去，直到站在他正后方。她无声地将一只手搭在他的肩上，停留了几秒钟，然后抬起另一只手，双臂一同环抱住真嗣的脖子。他则默默地抓住她的双腿，慢慢地将她举离地面，迫使明日香的胸脯紧贴在他的背上。真嗣对此有所察觉，却未放在心上。那里确实有些许触感，尽管相对较小。明日香更紧地环抱住真嗣，仿佛一个孩子般紧紧依附。她感到羞涩，但心想最糟糕的时刻已经过去。而真嗣关于喜欢和她在一起的话语，仍在她耳边回响。

"Ready?" he asked. “准备好了吗？”他问道。

"Yeah," said Asuka with a low sigh. Whether this was in annoyance or something else, Shinji didn't ask.

"嗯，"明日香低声叹息道。这声叹息是出于恼怒还是别的什么，真嗣没有追问。

They mounted the hill eventually with a small bit of difficulty. Shinji at one point lost his footing and almost did think he was going to fall backwards, just as Asuka had warned him about. The hillside had grown slippery with the downpour of rain making walking less than easy. That and with Asuka on his back, his balance was thrown off. As they had slipped, her grip around his neck tightened suddenly, cutting off his oxygen briefly, but he managed to right himself. The last thing he needed was to injure himself as well.

他们最终还是费了些周折才登上山丘。有一刻，真嗣失足差点向后摔倒，正如明日香之前警告过的那样。倾盆大雨使得山坡变得湿滑，行走变得不那么轻松。再加上明日香在他背上，他的平衡感被打破了。当他们滑倒时，她环在他脖子上的手臂突然收紧，短暂地切断了他的呼吸，但他设法稳住了自己。他最不需要的就是也让自己受伤。

Shinji didn't put much thought into where to take shelter, and headed towards the closest building in front of him. It wasn't the most glamorous building ever, but it did have a roof, and that meant the world to Shinji right now.

真嗣并没有多想该去哪里避难，只是朝着眼前最近的建筑物走去。那并非最华丽的建筑，但它有屋顶，对现在的真嗣来说，这就足够了。

Walking over broken glass where a door no doubt once stood, he made his way to the back of the store which looked to have been a plant shop at one point. Needless to say, all the plants had withered away by now and empty pots stood where flowers once would have grown.

他踏过碎玻璃，那里无疑曾有一扇门，向店铺后方走去，那里曾经似乎是一家植物店。不用说，所有的植物如今都已枯萎，空花盆立在曾经鲜花盛开的地方。

Finding a suitable spot away from the chill that was seeping through the broken door and windows, he gently set Asuka down, being sure that there wasn't any glass on the ground first.

他找到一个远离寒气侵入的破门和窗户的地方，轻轻放下明日香，确保地上没有玻璃碎片。

Standing back up, he turned around and was about to start walking to the beach to get there stuff when Asuka caught his hand and asked-

站起身来，他转过身正要走向海滩去取东西，明日香抓住他的手问道——

"Where are you going?" "你要去哪儿？"

Shinji turned around slowly to look at her. He wasn't sure if she was still scared or what, but she didn't seem to want him to leave. This touched Shinji somewhat.

真嗣缓缓转过身来看着她。他不确定她是否还在害怕，或者别的什么，但她似乎不想让他离开。这让真嗣有些感动。

"I'm going back down there to grab our stuff; the sleeping bags in particular."

"我要下去拿我们的东西，尤其是睡袋。"

Asuka continued holding onto him however, not seeming to let go, and it was only Shinji's next words that seemed to calm her slightly.

然而，明日香依旧紧紧抓着他，似乎不愿放手，直到真嗣接下来的话才让她稍微平静了些。

"Don't worry, I won't be gone very long."

“别担心，我不会离开太久的。”

Asuka took several seconds before she nodded and removed her hand from his. Shinji took several more long looks at her before he left.

明日香过了几秒钟才点点头，松开了手。真嗣又深深地看了她几眼，这才离开。

All in all, it only took him two trips to bring everything up to the building. He managed to pack mostly everything into the camping backpack and only went back the second time to get his sleeping bag. Asuka's he had determined was the priority, so he had placed that inside the pack, hoping it would dry off slightly.

总之，他只用了两趟就把所有东西搬到了楼上。他设法将大部分物品塞进了露营背包，第二次返回只是为了拿睡袋。他认定明日香的是优先项，因此将它放入包内，希望它能稍微晾干些。

As he made his way back into the store, he saw Asuka leaning against the wall he had left her at. At first he thought that she was sleeping, but she slowly opened her eyes and turned towards him. She seemed grim and tired.

当他回到店里时，看到明日香靠在他离开她的那面墙上。起初他以为她在睡觉，但她慢慢地睁开眼睛，转向他。她看起来脸色阴沉，疲惫不堪。

Shinji didn't say anything to her, but started unpacking everything from the pack. The building they were in was no doubt made of wood, but Shinji didn't care right now about that. They needed a fire more than anything and he was determined to make one.

真嗣没有对她说什么，而是开始从背包里拿出所有东西。他们所在的建筑无疑是木制的，但真嗣现在并不在乎这些。他们比任何东西都更需要火，而他决心要生起一堆火。

Gathering up some of the dryer, broken, pieces of wood that littered the front of the store, he tried lighting a fire. After much coaxing and cursing, he finally got it started. It was small, as Shinji didn't want to risk the fire break the floorboards as well. He wouldn't be able to keep it going through the night; an hour would be enough, as long as he watched it.

他收集了一些散落在店铺前干燥、破碎的木片，试图点燃火堆。经过多次哄劝和咒骂，他终于成功了。火很小，因为真嗣不想冒险让火也烧穿地板。他无法整夜维持火势；只要他看着，一个小时就足够了。

Still not looking over at Asuka, he started pulling food out of the backpack. They were both tired right now, but after everything, Shinji was hungry, and he guessed Asuka was as well.

他依旧没有看向明日香，只是开始从背包里取出食物。两人此刻都疲惫不堪，但经历了这么多，真嗣感到饥饿，他猜明日香也一样。

Cooking a small portion of rice for each of them was all he could manage right now though. Carrying Asuka up that slope was more tiring than he had initially thought, and his legs were starting to ache now.

尽管他现在只能为她们每人煮一小份米饭。背着明日香爬上那段坡道比他最初预想的要累得多，现在他的双腿已经开始酸痛了。

Pulling the pot off the fire, he passed it to Asuka along with a plastic spoon and said-

他把锅从火上拿下来，递给明日香一个塑料勺子，说道——

"Here eat this. After everything that happened, some food would do us good."

“来，吃点这个。经历了这么多事，吃点东西对我们有好处。”

Asuka didn't respond, but took the pot from him and ate slowly. Maybe she didn't have an appetite, but she did recognize the need for food at least.

明日香没有回应，但接过锅慢慢吃了起来。也许她没什么胃口，但至少她意识到了需要进食。

Shinji ate his share after her and laid the pot beside him. Pulling her sleeping bag out of the backpack, he laid it beside the fire, hoping it would dry quicker. He likewise did the same with his own.

真嗣在她之后吃完了自己的那份，将锅放在身旁。他从背包里拿出睡袋，铺在火堆旁，希望它能更快干透。他也同样处理了自己的睡袋。

Above them, the thunder continued and they could hear the rain striking the roof covering them. With shelter and fire covering them now though, Shinji wasn't as worried.

在他们上方，雷声持续不断，他们能听到雨水敲打在他们头顶的遮蔽物上。尽管现在有了庇护和火堆，真嗣不再那么担心了。

After several more minutes though, Shinji noticed the fire starting to lick the floorboards instead of the wood he had stacked. Wishing he didn't have to, he reluctantly kicked the fire out, plunging them both into darkness. Flicking on the old lighter, he examined the floorboard the fire had touched. It was slightly charcoaled, but didn't seem in any danger of breaking.

然而，几分钟后，真嗣注意到火开始舔舐地板而不是他堆放的木头。尽管不情愿，他还是踢灭了火，使两人陷入黑暗。他打开旧打火机，检查了火触及的地板。虽然有些焦黑，但似乎没有断裂的危险。

Letting out a low sigh, he sank back on his hands and wished he was anywhere but here.

他低声叹息，双手撑地向后靠去，只愿自己此刻身在别处。

"No fire then?" asked Asuka, after not having spoken for almost a whole hour.

“那就不生火了？”明日香在几乎整整一小时未发一言后问道。

"Can't risk it," said Shinji as he turned towards her. He could just barely make out the outline of her face in the darkened gloom.

“不能冒险。”真嗣转向她答道。在昏暗的光线中，他勉强能辨认出她的轮廓。

Lightning flashed in the distance, lighting of the shop for a brief second, and Shinji's and Asuka's eyes both traveled towards the beach they had recently frequented. It was strange, leaving it really. It wasn't home, not by far, but it was where they had lived for the past month. Leaving it in this state felt odd.

远处闪电划过，短暂照亮了店铺，真嗣和明日香的目光不约而同地投向了他们最近常去的沙滩。离开那里，真是奇怪。那儿算不上家，远非如此，但过去一个月里，他们确实在那里生活。以这种方式离开，感觉很别扭。

'It had to happened eventually,' Shinji reminded himself.

'最终还是发生了，' 真嗣提醒自己。

That was true, but this was so last minute. They didn't even have anytime to think much about it. It was either this or sit in the rain and rot.

这是真的，但这也太临时了。他们甚至没有时间多想。要么这样，要么坐在雨中腐烂。

"Hey Shinji?" asked Asuka from behind him.

“嘿，真嗣？” 明日香从他身后问道。

Shinji turned his head around to face her, but she was still looking towards the beach. Shinji's eyes were starting to adjust to the dark however, and he thought he saw her motion with her hand. It seemed she was patting the spot next to her, indicating that she wanted him to sit with her.

真嗣转过头来面对她，但她依旧望着海滩。不过，真嗣的眼睛逐渐适应了黑暗，他觉得她似乎在用手示意。她轻轻拍了拍身边的空位，显然是想让他过去坐下。

Shinji paused, not sure if she had understood right, but he saw her eyes flicker over to him, and there meaning seemed simple enough.

真嗣停顿了一下，不确定自己是否理解对了，但他看到她的目光闪烁着转向他，那意思似乎再明白不过了。

He wordlessly stood up then, and walked over to her side and sat down, leaning his back against the wall. They were right next to each other, arms bumping, almost leaning against one another. It was certainly warmer than sitting by oneself.

他默默地站起身，走到她身边坐下，背靠在墙上。他们紧挨着，手臂不时相碰，几乎靠在一起。这确实比一个人坐着要暖和得多。

They sat like that together for a long while, until Asuka said-

他们就这样坐在一起很久，直到明日香开口说——

"I'm sorry about earlier...I shouldn't have...I know we needed to move, but-"

“之前的事，我很抱歉……我不该……我知道我们需要离开，但是——”

She broke off, not sure what she was saying. But Shinji was turned towards her, watching her face. They were dryer, but Asuka's hair looked like a mess. He was sure that she normally kept it sleek and shiny, it had seemed that way when he had first found her. Now though, it looked like she had been living in a ditch.

她话说到一半就停住了，不确定自己在说什么。但真嗣转向了她，注视着她的脸。他们已经不那么湿了，但明日香的头发看起来一团糟。他记得她以前总是把头发打理得光滑亮丽，第一次见到她时就是那样。可现在，她的样子像是刚从沟里爬出来。

"It's fine," mumbled Shinji, "and I'm sorry I got angry. Yes we were in a hurry, but I shouldn't have reacted that way."

“没事的，”真嗣咕哝道，“我为刚才发火道歉。我们确实很赶时间，但我不该那样反应。”

Asuka shook her head. 明日香摇了摇头。

"You were just looking out for me...as you said earlier."

“你只是像之前说的那样，在照顾我。”

Her cheeks brightened briefly at this, but she continued.

她的脸颊因这番话微微泛红，但她继续说道。

"And what you said about friends...I had never thought about that until now. You were just...another person I guess...someone I had to share the misery with. I don't hate you...I used to I suppose...but after you came back..."

“还有你说的关于朋友的事……我直到现在才真正思考过。你曾经只是……我想，是另一个我不得不与之共患难的人。我不恨你……我想我曾一度是恨你的……但自从你回来之后……”

Asuka paused here, but Shinji understood what she saying. She continued however.

明日香在这里停顿了一下，但真嗣明白她的意思。然而她继续说道。

"I'm like you in that aspect though: we both never had any friends. I was an only child, no brothers or sisters, but I didn't have any friends either, not even in college where I kept to myself and my studies. Sure I had people I'd hang out with at school, but nobody I could call close. Nobody I could talk to certainly. Nobody that would listen..."

"不过在这方面我和你很像：我们都没有朋友。我是独生子女，没有兄弟姐妹，也没有朋友，即使在大学里我也总是独来独往，专注于学业。当然在学校里我会和一些人一起玩，但没有谁能称得上亲近。没有人可以倾诉，没有人会倾听......"

"As weird as it it, you're really the only person I've probably talked with much. When you helped me with walking, I enjoyed that, even if it was just pointless conversations. I'd never talked with someone my own age like that before."

"虽然听起来很奇怪，但你真的是我唯一深入交谈过的人。当你帮我练习走路时，我很享受，即使那些对话毫无意义。我以前从未和同龄人这样交谈过。"

Asuka turned towards him and smiled slightly before saying, "I guess I sorta see as a friend as well."

明日香转向他，微微一笑，然后说道："我想我也把你当成朋友了。"

Shinji blinked several times after hearing her say these things. The Asuka he was looking at now wasn't the usual grumpy abrasive one he was used to dealing with. He wouldn't have been surprised if she had laughed then, though only if there situation hadn't been so shitty.

听到她这么说，真嗣眨了好几下眼睛。此刻他眼中的明日香，不再是平日里那个脾气暴躁、难以相处的她。如果她当时笑出声来，他也不会感到意外，尽管那时的情境实在糟糕透顶。

"What did you mean by sorta though?" asked Shinji.

“你说的'有点'是什么意思？”真嗣问道。

Shrugging, Asuka said, "Just that you do get on my nerves sometimes I guess. Though that seems to be usual."

明日香耸了耸肩，说道：“只是有时候你确实会让我心烦意乱吧。不过，那似乎也是常态了。”

"Look who's talking," mumbled Shinji.

"“看看是谁在说话，”真嗣咕哝道。”

Asuka elbowed him in the side then, though she did it without much purpose. She seemed to be in better spirits.

"明日香这时用胳膊肘轻轻碰了他一下，虽然动作没什么目的性。她看起来心情好了些。”

"Say anything else and I'll hit you harder."

"“再说什么我可要揍得更狠了。””

Shinji took this with a grain of salt.

真嗣对此半信半疑。

"What now though?" asked Asuka after a few seconds passed.

"现在怎么办？" 几秒钟后，明日香问道。

"Huh?" "啊？"

"Are we going to stay here until the storm passes and move back down, or stay here?"

"我们是等风暴过去再下山，还是就留在这里？"

"Stay here I think," said Shinji.

“我想你留在这里，”真嗣说。

"Don't I get a say in this?"

“难道我不能发表意见吗？”

"Do you have anything to say?"

“你有什么要说的吗？”

"Just that this place is little better than the beach," grumbled Asuka.

"只是这个地方比海滩好不了多少，"明日香抱怨道。

"It has a roof," Shinji pointed out.

"它有屋顶，"真嗣指出。

"Then you may as well call it a house if its got a roof," said Asuka sarcastically.

"那如果它有屋顶，你干脆就叫它房子好了，"明日香讽刺地说。

Shinji didn't reply to this, but did say, "I don't know what we're going to do after the storm passes. Not stay here long I think. A fire can't be lit constantly, and warmth is important right now. How are your legs?"

真嗣没有回应这句话，而是说道：“我不知道风暴过后我们该怎么办。我想不会在这里久留。火不能一直点着，现在保暖很重要。你的腿怎么样了？”

"Better I suppose," said Asuka as she ran a hand down them. "They're not as cold as they were, but standing is probably still difficult, even if my ankle wasn't hurting."

"我想好些了。" 明日香说着，用手抚过它们，"没之前那么冷了，但即便脚踝不疼，站着可能还是困难。"

"Your sleeping bag has dried some," said Shinji as he leaned forward and ran a hand on the fabric.

"你的睡袋已经干了一些。" 真嗣说着，倾身向前，用手抚摸着布料。

Asuka watched as he did this, before she let out a yawn, trying to stifle it. They hadn't gotten much sleep yet, which they were sorely lacking now.

明日香看着他这样做，随后打了个哈欠，试图压抑住。他们还没怎么睡过觉，现在正迫切需要休息。

"Sleep," mumbled Asuka, feeling both tired and unwilling to fall asleep at the same time. She was remembering the dream.

“睡觉，”明日香咕哝着，既感到疲惫又不愿入睡。她正在回忆那个梦。

Shinji turned towards her, watching her. He was half tempted to ask her what she had been dreaming about down on the beach before she started crawling over on hands and knees towards her sleeping bag. She unzipped it and crawled inside, zipping it back up. Half of it was almost dry, the side that was closest to the fire, but Asuka could already feeling her eyelids starting to close.

真嗣转向她，注视着她。他有一半的冲动想问她在海滩上梦见了什么，就在她开始手脚并用爬向睡袋之前。她拉开睡袋的拉链，钻了进去，又拉上了拉链。靠近火堆的那一侧几乎已经干了，但明日香已经感觉到眼皮开始沉重。

"Aren't you going to sleep?" she asked Shinji, her voice growing quieter.

"你不打算睡觉吗？" 她问真嗣，声音渐渐变小。

"In a bit, I'm going to stay awake for a while longer."

"一会儿吧，我想再醒一会儿。"

Asuka looked up at him, realizing that he was sitting almost directly next to her. She almost said something, but stopped herself.

明日香抬头看着他，意识到他就坐在她旁边。她几乎要说些什么，但还是忍住了。

'If he hasn't done anything by now, then there's no reason to suspect he would now,' she thought. She really could trust Shinji she supposed.

'如果他到现在还没做什么，那么就没有理由怀疑他现在会做。' 她想。她想，她真的可以信任真嗣。

With this comforting thought, she very quickly fell asleep, her breathing slowing.

带着这个令人安心的想法，她很快便睡着了，呼吸逐渐放缓。

Shinji watched her for perhaps ten minutes. Sleep was calling him as well, but he wanted to be beside her for a while longer. He couldn't understand why, but he simply wanted this. Maybe he was afraid that she would awake from another dream, this time screaming. But no such thing happened. She continued sleeping peacefully.

真嗣注视着她，或许有十分钟。睡意也在向他招手，但他还想在她身边多待一会儿。他无法理解为什么，但他就是想要这样。也许他是害怕她会从另一个梦中醒来，这次尖叫。但这样的事情并没有发生。她继续安详地睡着。

Shinji eventually got up, and walked towards his sleeping bag.. It was still immensely soaked, but he flung it out and lay on top of it, more content this way instead of inside it. He folded his hands behind his head and closed his eyes, and within minutes, he was out.

真嗣最终站起身，走向他的睡袋。它仍然湿透了，但他把它甩开，躺在上面，这样比在里面更让他感到满足。他将双手叠在脑后，闭上眼睛，不出几分钟，他就睡着了。

Some hours later, Shinji was awoken by someone nudging him gently. Of course it was Asuka. Shinji rolled over to face her and was surprised to see that she was leaning over him. He looked up at her for several seconds and saw that she seemed to have a worried look on her face.

几个小时后，真嗣被某人轻轻推醒。当然是明日香。真嗣翻身面对她，惊讶地发现她正俯身看着自己。他抬头凝视了她几秒钟，注意到她脸上似乎带着忧虑的表情。

"Whats up?" he asked quietly.

"怎么了？" 他轻声问道。

"Can't sleep," mumbled Asuka.

"睡不着，" 明日香咕哝道。

Shinji watched her for several seconds before he sat up and asked, "How come?"

真嗣注视了她几秒钟，然后坐起身来问道："为什么？"

Asuka didn't quite meet his eyes when she replied, "Just couldn't."

明日香回答时并没有直视他的眼睛，"只是做不到。"

Shinji's eyes narrowed, but not maliciously. If he was guessing, it had something to do with what happened earlier. The storm outside continued to rage, but it seemed that the thunder had moved on at least.

真嗣的眼睛微微眯起，但并非出于恶意。如果他在猜测，那一定与之前发生的事情有关。外面的风暴依旧肆虐，但至少雷声已经远去。

Rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand he asked, "Is this something to do with earlier?"

他用手背揉了揉眼睛，问道："这与之前的事有关吗？"

Asuka nodded her head slowly. She seemed nervous and unsure, as though telling Shinji was a mistake that she would be regretting later.

明日香缓缓点头。她显得紧张而不安，仿佛告诉真嗣是一个她日后会后悔的错误。

"Do you...want to talk?" “你……想谈谈吗？”

Shinji wasn't sure if he could do anything to comfort her, but he could at least listen.

真嗣不确定自己能否安慰她，但至少他可以倾听。

"I guess," said Asuka slowly, still unsure.

“我想是吧，”明日香缓缓说道，依旧不太确定。

Shinji nodded and stood up. Asuka watched him and he passed her, until he reached for her sleeping bag which is when she became defensive.

真嗣点点头，站起身来。明日香看着他走过自己，直到他伸手去拿她的睡袋，这时她变得警觉起来。

"What are you doing!?" “你在干什么！？”

"Moving your sleeping bag closer to mine."

"把你的睡袋挪近点儿。"

"I could have moved it myself! And what makes you think I want to sleep next to you either!"

"我自己也能挪！再说，你怎么就觉得我想睡你旁边了！"

"I didn't say anything about sleeping next to each other. Just that it would be better if we both kept warm while you...talked." Shinji wasn't sure how this came off, but he hoped Asuka would understand this logic. And it seemed that she did, after thinking about this for a moment.

"我没说我们要睡在一起。只是说，这样我们都能保暖，而你……可以继续聊。" 真嗣不确定这话听起来如何，但他希望明日香能理解这个逻辑。而她似乎确实在思考片刻后明白了。

"Fine," she said as she crossed her arms, "but the minute this is over, I'm moving away from you."

"好吧，"她交叉双臂说道，"但这件事一结束，我就离你远远的。"

"Yeah," said Shinji, rather uninterested.

"嗯，"真嗣说道，显得颇为漠然。"

He lay her sleeping bag about a foot from his own, and then laid back down on his. Asuka slowly got in her own, watching Shinji as she did so. They had been physically close before, but this felt too much like sleeping together.

他把她的睡袋铺在自己的睡袋旁边约一英尺处，然后重新躺回自己的睡袋里。明日香缓缓钻进自己的睡袋，一边观察着真嗣。他们之前也有过身体上的亲近，但这次感觉太像是在一起睡觉了。

After she crawled in, she covered her head with most of the sleeping bag so that only her face was sticking out. Shinji had to suppress a smile as he saw this, and he sorta thought Asuka knew he had been about to smile.

她爬进去后，用睡袋的大部分盖住头，只露出脸来。真嗣看到这一幕，不得不忍住笑意，他觉得明日香可能知道他差点笑出来。

"What happened?" Shinji asked after a moments pause. He wasn't sure how he was supposed to ask her about a nightmare she had had, but he hoped this would suffice.

“怎么了？”真嗣停顿片刻后问道。他不确定该如何询问她关于噩梦的事，但他希望这样问就够了。

Asuka took even longer to respond, and when she did, it was with subdued breath.

明日香花了更长时间才回应，当她开口时，声音低沉而克制。

"My childhood...wasn't very great, though from what you told me, your's wasn't great either."

“我的童年……并不太好，不过听你说的，你的也不怎么样。”

"Yeah," said Shinji as he was reminded of his father.

“是啊，”真嗣说道，想起了他的父亲。

"I think I mentioned before...that my mother worked at Gehirn, the predecessor of Nerv. Well...she died when I was young. I remember her slightly I suppose, but not much. I was left with my father after her death, and for a while, everything seemed to be fine."

“我想我之前提过……我母亲曾在 Gehirn 工作，那是 Nerv 的前身。嗯……她在我很小的时候就去世了。我大概还记得她一点，但不多。她去世后，我就和父亲一起生活，有一段时间，一切似乎都还好。”

"It starting with the drinking. He would come home nights smelling of alcohol, screaming for me. I was only six or seven at the time, but I can still remember the smell of booze on his breath. He...abused me, is the best way I can put this."

一切始于酗酒。他夜归时浑身酒气，对我大吼大叫。那时我才六七岁，至今仍记得他呼出的酒臭味。他……虐待我，这是我最贴切的描述。

Asuka choked up a little here. Shinji could tell that she was greatly pained by this story, but she continued onward.

明日香在这里哽咽了一下。真嗣能看出这个故事让她极为痛苦，但她还是继续说了下去。

"Then the whoring started. He would bring woman home every few nights, fuck them, and then send them out. A few times I heard him calling them my mothers name, which sickened me greatly. When he was drunk though, he sometimes mistook me for a younger version of my mother. We have the same color of hair you see."

"然后那放荡的生活就开始了。他每隔几晚就会带女人回家，与她们发生关系，然后打发她们走。有几次我听到他叫她们我母亲的名字，这让我感到非常恶心。但当他喝醉时，有时会把我误认为是我母亲的年轻版本。你知道，我们有着相同颜色的头发。"

"I started to be more subdued, not talking back as much, or just learning to live with it. I was seven at the time, so what the fuck could I possibly do? The house rank like rotten food from the trash that never got taken out. Stacks of dirty dishes filled the sink, and the bathroom was covered in shit and vomit half the time."

"我开始变得更加克制，不再那么顶嘴，或者只是学会忍受。那时我才七岁，我他妈能做什么呢？房子里弥漫着腐烂食物的臭味，因为垃圾从未被清理出去。水槽里堆满了脏盘子，而浴室一半的时间都覆盖着屎和呕吐物。"

"I started to think for myself though, vowing to leave that shit hole one day. I managed eventually of course. When I was old enough, I filled some papers and managed to get my way into a college in Germany. This was thanks to Nerv in some aspects I guess, as they knew I was the daughter of Kyoko, thats my mothers name. So I was able to get into college thanks to them. When I came back to tell my father this, that I was leaving, he started shouted at me, saying I was just like my mother. He always resented her for her research and success I suppose."

"不过我开始为自己着想，发誓有一天要离开那个鬼地方。最终我当然做到了。当我足够大时，我填写了一些文件，设法进入了德国的一所大学。这在某种程度上要感谢 Nerv，因为他们知道我是 Kyoko 的女儿，那是我母亲的名字。所以我能进入大学多亏了他们。当我回来告诉父亲我要离开时，他开始对我大喊大叫，说我就像我母亲一样。我想他一直怨恨她因为她的研究和成功。"

Asuka paused here and drew in breath. Her head was starting to hurt again as she remembered all these painful memories.

明日香在这里停顿了一下，深吸一口气。当她回想起这些痛苦的记忆时，头又开始疼了。

"I haven't seen him since I left," she continued. "I kept everything bottled up inside me for the most part and just tried to forget everything since I became an Evangelion pilot. I enjoyed the fact that I had been selected to pilot one, the chosen few. I felt superior then everyone else."

“自从我离开后，我就再也没见过他，”她继续说道，“大部分时间里，我把一切都憋在心里，试图忘记自从成为 EVA 驾驶员以来的一切。我享受着被选中驾驶 EVA 的事实，成为少数精英之一。那时，我感到自己比其他人都要优越。”

"I remembered...things, when you left Shinji," Asuka said. "When I was on the beach...dying reminded me of those times. The smell of that house, the hopelessness, my father, the abuse. I remembered those things that I had purposefully forgotten about. It rushed back to me though, as it did tonight. The thunder might have triggered it, but for a moment, I thought that I was back there. I sometimes think I am when I first wake up, but then I see the things around me and everything comes back. I'm stuck in this damn place with nobody but you...but I'd still prefer my life now than how it was back then."

"我记得...那些事，当你离开真嗣的时候，"明日香说，"当我躺在沙滩上...濒死让我想起了那些时光。那房子的气味，绝望感，我的父亲，那些虐待。我记起了那些我曾刻意遗忘的事情。它们如潮水般涌回，就像今晚一样。雷声或许触发了这一切，但有那么一刻，我以为自己又回到了那里。有时我刚醒来也会这么想，但随后看到周围的一切，记忆便都回来了。我被困在这个该死的地方，除了你别无他人...但我宁愿选择现在的生活，而不是过去的模样。"

Asuka finished talking then, and turned her face to Shinji. She had been speaking to the ceiling this whole time, and only now looked at him.

明日香说完后，转向了真嗣。她一直对着天花板说话，直到现在才看向他。

Shinji's face was passive for the most part, but he was angry, even though he had never met this person.

真嗣的脸上大部分时间都是平静的，但他很生气，尽管他从未见过这个人。

"That-" Shinji started, but Asuka cut him off.

“那-” 真嗣刚开口，就被明日香打断了。

"Don't bother saying anything about him. He's dead, just like millions of other people. I can't say I dislike the thought of his death, but thinking about it isn't doing me any good."

"别费心提起他了。他和成千上万的人一样，已经死了。我不能说我讨厌他死去的想法，但想着这些对我毫无益处。"

"Even so," mumbled Shinji.

"即便如此，" 真嗣喃喃道。"

"Thats from the past," replied Asuka. "I haven't forgiven him, but nor will I forget him. I have to live with that. Just like you and your father."

"那是过去的事了，" 明日香回答道。"我还没有原谅他，但也不会忘记他。我必须接受这一点。就像你和你父亲一样。"

Shinji was silent as she said this. Yes, there stories had certainly similarities he supposed, but he was once again surprised by these similarities. He wouldn't forget about his father, as it was something that he couldn't come to grips with at the same time. If he had said something to him before all this, maybe, but seeing as he was likely dead...

绫波说这话时，真嗣沉默了。是的，他觉得这些故事确实有相似之处，但他再次对这些相似之处感到惊讶。他无法忘记他的父亲，这是他同时无法接受的事情。如果在这之前他对他说了些什么，也许会不同，但既然他很可能已经死了...

"Asuka?" he asked. “明日香？”他问道。

"Hmm?" "嗯？"

"Why did you decide to tell me this."

"你为什么决定告诉我这些。"

"Brooding over it wasn't doing me any good, and honestly, talking about it feels okay. As I said, I've never had anyone to say these things to. Maybe sleep will come easier now."

"一直闷在心里对我没什么好处，说实话，谈论这些感觉还不错。就像我说的，我从来没有可以倾诉这些的人。也许现在我能更容易入睡了。"

She shrugged after she said this, and they both lapsed into silence.

她说完后耸了耸肩，两人便陷入了沉默。

After several moments though, Asuka slid out of her sleeping bag, and sat up, looking at Shinji.

然而，过了一会儿，明日香从睡袋里钻了出来，坐起身，看着真嗣。

"Um...Shinji?" “呃...真嗣？”

"Huh?" "啊？"

Shinji turned to look at her, and saw that she was fidgeting slightly with her sleeping bag.

真嗣转头看向她，发现她正轻轻摆弄着自己的睡袋。

"What I want to say is...I guess...well...thanks for today, for listening to me, and everything."

“我想说的是……嗯……好吧……谢谢你今天听我说话，还有所有的一切。”

Shinji wouldn't have been surprised if his jaw had dropped; Asuka was actually thanking him?

如果真嗣的下巴真的掉了下来，他也不会感到惊讶；明日香竟然在感谢他？

"We're in this together," he replied, shrugging off his initial surprise. "And arguing about it isn't going to change that."

"我们是一起的，" 他回答道，摆脱了最初的惊讶。"争论这一点并不能改变什么。"

"Doesn't mean I can't dislike it," mumbled Asuka quietly.

"这并不意味着我不讨厌它，" 明日香小声嘀咕道。"

"Dislike it all you want," said Shinji as he sat up as well. "Doesn't change the fact we're stuck together for who knows how long."

"讨厌就讨厌吧，" 真嗣边说边坐起身来。"这改变不了我们不知要在一起多久的现实。"

"Enjoyable," smirked Asuka.

"有趣," 明日香微微一笑。

They sat like that for several seconds, staring at each other until Asuka turned her head away and slowly stood up. This surprised Shinji slightly.

他们就这样坐了几秒钟，互相凝视着，直到明日香转过头去，慢慢站起身来。这让真嗣稍感惊讶。

"Isn't your ankle still hurting?"

"你的脚踝不是还在疼吗？"

"A bit, but its manageable. How do you think I got over here?"

“有一点，但还能应付。你觉得我是怎么过来的？”

Crawling came first to Shinji's mind, but that was a sure way to piss off Asuka.

爬行首先出现在真嗣的脑海中，但那肯定会惹恼明日香。

"Anyway, I'm going to sleep," said Asuka as she rolled up her sleeping bag and carried it away from him. Shinji couldn't help but notice that it wasn't the same spot she had left it. She was closer to him, but not by much.

“总之，我要睡了。”明日香说着，卷起睡袋，从他身边挪开。真嗣不禁注意到，那位置并非她原先放置的地方。她离他更近了些，但也没近多少。

As she lay back down though, Shinji felt there was one last thing he should tell her.

然而，当她再次躺下时，真嗣觉得还有一件事应该告诉她。

"Asuka?" “明日香？”

"What? I'm trying to fall asleep over here idiot."

“什么？我正努力入睡呢，白痴。”

"I know...just that, if you ever have anything you need to talk about..."

“我知道……只是想说，如果你有什么需要倾诉的……”

Asuka rolled over to face him and said, "Talk to you? Seems almost as pointless as talking to the First Child." She smiled though and said, "But I'll remember that offer I guess. Now goodnight, and don't wake me until breakfast is ready."

明日香翻身面对着他，说道：“跟你说话？简直像跟第一适格者说话一样毫无意义。”但她笑了笑，又说：“不过我会记住你的提议的。现在晚安，早餐准备好之前别叫醒我。”

Without much passage of time, Asuka was fast asleep, her face turned towards Shinji. He fell asleep shortly afterwards, now wrapped in his sleeping bag, which had finally dried. He was glad that Asuka had decided to tell him about this, even if it had been rather morbid. Even if it had been small, they had grown closer.

没过多久，明日香就沉沉睡去，脸朝着真嗣。他随后也睡着了，裹在终于干透的睡袋里。他很高兴明日香决定告诉他这件事，尽管内容颇为阴郁。即便变化微小，他们之间的距离确实拉近了。

The rain had subsided during the night, and only a light drizzle was falling down. Shinji stood outside the shop they were living in and inhaled the clean fresh air. It did at least seem cleaner after the downpour, even if it had initially sucked. The small droplets of water that was falling into his hair did feel refreshing.

雨在夜间停了，现在只有轻柔的细雨飘落。真嗣站在他们居住的店铺外，深吸了一口清新的空气。至少在暴雨过后，空气似乎变得清新了，尽管起初让人不快。水珠轻轻落在他的发间，感觉很是提神。

They had already finished breakfast but had gotten up extremely late, but that was to be expected. Neither of them mentioned what had transpired last night, and Asuka seemed to be determinedly ignoring it. She was pointedly nicer to Shinji, but still seemed to be ashamed of herself over how she had reacted when the thunder had woken them. Shinji didn't say anything, knowing that it would anger her. Talking had been for last night, and Shinji had a feeling that while Asuka had told him about it, she didn't want him telling her everything was okay.

他们已经用过早餐，却起得极晚，这也在情理之中。两人都未提及昨晚发生的事，明日香似乎决心对此置之不理。她对真嗣明显更友善了，但仍对自己在雷声惊醒他们时的反应感到羞愧。真嗣没有说什么，他知道这会激怒她。昨晚是倾诉的时刻，而真嗣有种感觉，尽管明日香向他吐露了心声，但她并不希望他告诉她一切都没事。

She did seem to be able to walk still, which seemed to be a blessing thought Shinji as she walked outside to stand beside him.

她似乎还能走路，这让真嗣觉得是一种幸运，因为她走出屋外，站在了他身边。

"Still raining?" she asked.

“还在下雨吗？”她问道。

"Yeah, but nothing like last night. Its even kinda nice."

“是啊，不过不像昨晚那样。现在还挺不错的。”

"How can you say that after how miserable we were?" Asuka had never liked the rain, as it always depressed her slightly. Shinji was however rather surprised that Asuka had implied we in this topic.

“你怎么能在我们经历了那么多痛苦之后还说这种话？”明日香从未喜欢过雨，因为它总是让她感到些许压抑。然而，真嗣对明日香在这个话题上使用了“我们”一词感到相当惊讶。

"C'mon, lets go back inside," said Asuka after a few moments passed. Shinji would honestly rather have stayed there a few seconds longer, but he followed suit.

"来吧，我们回屋里去，"几分钟后，明日香说道。真嗣其实还想在外面多待一会儿，但他还是跟着进去了。

Shinji had lit the fire while he had been making breakfast, but now, without it burning, the temperature had dropped inside. Shinji sat down on his sleeping bag cross-legged while Asuka sat across from him, leaning up against the wall. She didn't have the sleeping bag wrapping around her, but the hood of her sweatshirt was covering her head, and the drawstrings were pulled so tightly that just her mouth and nose was sticking out. Shinji at first thought to comment on this, but then thought otherwise.

真嗣在做早餐时点燃了火，但现在火熄灭了，屋内的温度也下降了。真嗣盘腿坐在睡袋上，而明日香则坐在对面，靠在墙上。她没有用睡袋裹着，但连帽衫的帽子盖在头上，抽绳拉得紧紧的，只露出嘴巴和鼻子。真嗣起初想对此发表评论，但后来打消了这个念头。

Shinji was just wishing that he had a book to read or something to listen to though when Asuka asked him-

真嗣正希望自己有本书可读或有什么可听的时候，明日香问他——

"Shinji...when the weather clears up...would you be interested in going to the Geofront?"

"真嗣...等天气放晴了...你有兴趣去地底城吗？"

"Geofront?" said Shinji confused, and then he remembered.

"地底城？" 真嗣困惑地说，随即想了起来。

"Where Nerv is?" he asked suddenly interested.

"就是 NERV 总部所在的地方吗？" 他突然感兴趣地问道。

"Yeah," nodded Asuka. "I think it'd be a good idea for the both of us to see it. I doubt anyone is alive there, but it seems to be an important place to the both of us."

"嗯，"明日香点头道，"我觉得我们俩去看看挺好的。那里估计已经没人活着了，但对我们俩来说，那地方似乎挺重要的。"

"True," replied Shinji. "What do you think we'll find though?"

“真的，”真嗣回答，“你觉得我们会找到什么呢？”

"Honestly...nothing in all likely hood. If the city is any indiction, the Geofront isn't much better off."

“老实说……很可能什么都没有。如果城市的情况有任何指示，地底都市也不会好到哪里去。”

"Wouldn't it be safer underground though?"

“不过，地下会不会更安全些？”

"You're forgetting though that the angels were targeting this place because Nerv was here."

"但你忘了，天使们之所以瞄准这个地方，是因为 Nerv 在这里。"

"Oh...right," mumbled Shinji. He had hoped to maybe see one of the Evangelions, but they most likely would have been all destroyed in the battle...if anything had happened of course.

"哦...对啊，" 真嗣喃喃自语。他本希望能看到一台 EVA，但它们很可能已经在战斗中被全部摧毁了...当然，如果真的发生了什么的话。

"Why did you ask though?" wondered Shinji.

"不过，你为什么要问呢？" 真嗣疑惑道。

"I thought that you would like to see for yourself where your father spent most of his time. Myself...well, after...everything I said last night, I felt like visiting Nerv. It was the one place that I felt like I was wanted. Sure the adults talked with there usual bullshit. But some of the people were nice. My guardian in particular looked after me...for the most part at least."

"我以为你会想亲自看看你父亲大部分时间待的地方。至于我...嗯，昨晚说了那些话之后，我觉得去 Nerv 看看。那是唯一让我感觉被需要的地方。当然，大人们还是满口胡言。但有些人挺好的。特别是我的监护人，至少大部分时间都在照顾我。"

Asuka suddenly started to smile, making Shinji confused.

明日香突然开始微笑，这让真嗣感到困惑。

"What was that for?" asked Shinji.

"你笑什么？" 真嗣问道。

"Nothing," Asuka shook her head. "Just remembering something about her."

"没什么，" 明日香摇了摇头。"只是想起了关于她的一些事。"

"Do you know where we could get in though?"

"你知道我们能从哪里进去吗？"

"There were several emergency passages that employees used. Even though the city is little more then ruins, I should be able to find one that we can access."

"有几个员工使用的紧急出口。虽然这座城市几乎成了废墟，但我应该能找到一个我们可以进入的通道。"

Shinji nodded his head then, thinking about that point when he would be able to see Nerv.

碇真嗣那时点了点头，心中想着何时才能看到 NERV 的景象。

Asuka however was watching the passive look on his face and eventually had to say, "I'm surprised you're not more exited about this. You've been asking questions about Nerv at almost every chance you got. I'm sick of it honestly."

然而，明日香却在观察着他那被动的表情，最终不得不说道：“我真没想到你对此并不更兴奋。你几乎每次有机会都在问关于 NERV 的问题。说实话，我真是听腻了。”

"I just don't know what to think of it I guess. Hearing about it and seeing are two different things. Not to mention, my father was the director, and that I might have worked there if the angels hadn't attacked."

“我想我只是不知道该怎么看待这一切。听说的和亲眼所见是两码事。更不用说，我父亲曾是那里的指挥官，如果不是使徒袭击，我可能已经在那里工作了。”

"I guess if you're that worried, we don't have to go then," said Asuka, teasing him.

“我想如果你这么担心的话，那我们就不必去了。”明日香逗他说。

"I'm fine," said Shinji rather harshly.

"我没事," 真嗣相当生硬地说道。

"God, I was just kidding idiot," scowled Asuka.

"天啊，我只是开个玩笑，笨蛋," 明日香皱眉道。

"Forget it," said Shinji. "If the rain lets up tomorrow, then we can start searching."

"算了," 真嗣说。"如果明天雨停了，我们就可以开始搜索了。

Asuka rolled her eyes and sighed, forgetting about his stupidity. Shinji however was wondering what the Geofront looked liked. Asuka had told him it had an underground lake at the very least, but other than that, she hadn't said much.

明日香翻了个白眼，叹了口气，不再理会他的愚蠢。然而，真嗣却在想地底都市是什么样子。明日香至少告诉过他那里有一个地下湖，除此之外，她就没多说什么了。

Whether they would have gone there if Asuka hadn't told him about her father, Shinji wondered about this. It was certainly an important place for the both of them, no getting around that fact he supposed, maybe even more so for Asuka.

真嗣在想，如果不是明日香告诉他关于她父亲的事，他们会不会去那里。那地方对他们俩来说无疑很重要，这一点无可否认，也许对明日香来说更是如此。

They had grown closer since last night Shinji supposed, and this was a step in the right direction. But, he was nervous all the same about what might await them down in the bowels of the Geofront.

真嗣觉得，自从昨晚以来，他们之间的关系更近了，这是一个正确的方向。但是，对于地底都市深处可能等待着他们的未知，他同样感到紧张。

### Chapter 7: Return

Longer chapter here then what I've done so far, but I'll talk more about stuff at the end of this.

这里的内容比目前为止我所做的要长，但我会在最后详细谈谈。

---

The rain continued drizzling down into the next day, though this didn't stop Shinji and Asuka from starting there journey to the Geofront. There going was still slow however. Asuka could walk well enough, but she did tire out easily, and they had to stop several times. Thankfully, Shinji had brought plenty of food for the journey. He was a little worried about the water, but if the rain continued to drizzle down, then they should be fine.

雨继续淅淅沥沥地下到第二天，但这并没有阻止真嗣和明日香前往地底都市的旅程。然而，他们的行进依然缓慢。明日香虽然能走，但很容易疲劳，他们不得不多次停下来休息。幸运的是，真嗣带了足够的食物。他有点担心水的问题，但如果雨继续这样下，他们应该没问题。

Though Shinji had already seen the city in great detail, Asuka kept on turning her head as she looked around. Shinji wasn't sure if she was surprised by the surroundings or simply curious. He rather suspected it was this last one. She seemed to be mumbling occasionally about the devastation, and Shinji had a strong suspicion about what she thought had caused all this.

尽管真嗣已经非常详细地看过这座城市，但明日香还是不停地转头四处张望。真嗣不确定她是被周围的景象震惊了，还是仅仅出于好奇。他更倾向于后者。她似乎偶尔会喃喃自语关于这片废墟的事，真嗣强烈怀疑她认为这一切的罪魁祸首是什么。

They had left earlier that morning, just as the sun was beginning to rise. Though now, it was closer to noon.

他们一早就出发了，那时太阳刚刚开始升起。而现在，时间已接近中午。

They took a break again for lunch, both eating in silence for a greater part of the time. Asuka still seemed to be intrigued about the state of Tokyo-3, and Shinji was wondering what Nerv would look like.

他们再次停下来吃午饭，大部分时间两人都沉默地吃着。明日香似乎仍然对第三新东京市的状态感到好奇，而真嗣则在想 NERV 会是什么样子。

Finishing lunch, they packed up and continued on there way. Several times, Asuka paused at certain points and just looked at a building or maintenance access before shaking her head. Shinji didn't ask, but he assumed these were places that Nerv employees could gain access to the Geofront through. Unfortunately, most places they passed were completely crushed.

吃完午饭，他们收拾好行李继续前行。有好几次，明日香在某些地方停下脚步，凝视着某个建筑或维修通道，然后摇了摇头。真嗣没有问，但他猜想这些地方可能是 NERV 员工进入地底都市的通道。不幸的是，他们经过的大多数地方都已被彻底摧毁。

The rain started relenting, as the sun was high in the sky and they had to take another break, since Asuka was starting to get tired.

雨势开始减弱，太阳高悬天空，他们不得不再次休息，因为明日香开始感到疲惫。

Leaning against the shade of a building that miraculously had its awning still intact, Asuka downed the bottle of water that Shinji had passed her mere moments ago. The sun was slowing them down more so than the rain had, and Asuka seemed to be tiring out easier. Once or twice, Shinji saw her wince. Even though it had only been a sprain, her ankle must still be hurting.

明日香靠在一栋建筑的阴影下，这栋建筑奇迹般地保留了遮阳篷。她一口气喝完了真嗣刚刚递给她的那瓶水。阳光比雨水更拖慢了他们的步伐，明日香似乎更容易感到疲倦。真嗣一两次看到她皱眉。尽管只是扭伤，她的脚踝肯定还在疼。

"Maybe we should just head back," said Shinji as he leaned against the building with her.

“也许我们该回去了，”真嗣说着，靠在建筑物上，与她并肩。

Asuka turned towards him and simply frowned, showing her displeasure at this.

明日香转向他，只是皱了皱眉，表达出她的不满。

"Its just a suggestion," said Shinji. "Its not like the Geofront is going anywhere, and who knows how long it'll take to find an access point we can use."

“这只是个建议，”真嗣说，“反正第三新东京市也不会跑掉，谁知道要花多长时间才能找到一个我们能用的入口。”

"I'd rather do this now," said Asuka.

“我宁愿现在就做，”明日香说。

"How come?" “怎么会？”

"If I ignore it later, I may not be able to go back."

“如果我以后忽视它，可能就回不去了。”

Shinji would have loved to ask why, but he thought it was a personal answer she didn't want to answer. Maybe she had another reason she wanted to go to the Geofront then what she alluded last night.

真嗣本想问为什么，但他觉得这可能是她不想回答的个人问题。也许她想去地底都市的理由和她昨晚暗示的有所不同。

"We aren't going back," stated Asuka firmly.

“我们不会回去的。”明日香坚定地说。

Almost with that thought, she pushed herself off the wall, and started walking forward. This was so sudden that Shinji had to struggle to gather up the backpack he had dumped next to them.

几乎在那一念之间，她推开墙壁，开始向前走去。这一切来得如此突然，以至于真嗣不得不努力捡起他刚才扔在他们旁边的背包。

Just as Shinji had once noticed, as they got further into the city, the buildings here seemed to be even more demolished. It wasn't unusual to just see entire city blocks completely destroyed. Skyscrapers had fallen down, making it difficult to navigate across sometimes. Shinji was still worried that the infrastructure in some of these buildings weren't the best, so they tried to avoid these ones.

正如真嗣曾经注意到的那样，随着他们深入城市，这里的建筑似乎更加破败。整片街区被彻底摧毁并不罕见。摩天大楼倒塌，有时难以穿越。真嗣仍然担心这些建筑中的一些基础设施并不完善，所以他们尽量避开这些地方。

They passed more potential access points, all of which Asuka ignored. It seemed that there was a particular one she had in mind, but how far it was, was a different story. Shinji was starting to wonder if they would even find one before night time. They hadn't brought any flash lights, which now that he thought about it, was a problem. Even if they did find this place, if they didn't have light, there wasn't much hope.

他们经过更多可能的入口，但都被明日香忽略了。看来她心中有一个特定的目标，但距离多远则是另一回事。真嗣开始怀疑他们是否能在天黑前找到一个。他们没有带手电筒，现在想来，这是个问题。即使找到了这个地方，如果没有光亮，希望也不大。

They continued walking in silence, Shinji only trying to talk for the sake of it, but Asuka seemed more focussed on her goal. She seemed determined, or obsessed might have been a better way of putting it. Shinji was starting to worry about her, as she seemed to continue pushing herself forward, even though each step seemed to be more tiring then the last.

他们继续默默前行，真嗣只是为了打破沉默而试图交谈，但明日香似乎更专注于她的目标。她显得坚定，或者说执着可能更贴切。真嗣开始担心她，因为她似乎一直在推动自己前进，尽管每一步都比上一步更加疲惫。

After another hour of this however, Shinji had to say something. Asuka had stumbled many times since there last break point, but every time Shinji tried to help her, she had refused him rudely. Now that she could walk on her own, she didn't want any help from him. Shinji couldn't call this walking however; she was stumbling around more than walking now.

然而，又过了一个小时，真嗣不得不开口了。自上次休息后，明日香已经跌跌撞撞了好几次，但每次真嗣试图帮助她时，她都粗鲁地拒绝了。现在她能自己走了，就不想再接受他的帮助。不过，真嗣觉得这根本不算是走路；她现在跌跌撞撞的次数比走路还多。

"Asuka, thats enough," said Shinji as he stopped and swung off his pack. The sun was beginning to set now, and he figured now was the best time to halt.

"明日香，够了。" 真嗣说着停下脚步，卸下背包。太阳开始西沉，他觉得现在是停下来休息的最佳时机。

"No, we can still go further," said Asuka as she stood there, sweat dripping off her brow.

“不，我们还能走得更远，”明日香站在那里说道，汗水顺着她的额头滴落。

"You're exhausted, and it hasn't even been a week since you started walking again."

“你已经筋疲力尽了，而且你重新开始走路还不到一周。”

"I don't need your pity."

“我不需要你的同情。”

"I'm not trying to pity you, I'm just trying to watch out for you."

"我不是在可怜你，只是想关心你。"

"Well stop. Its disgusting."

"那就别这样了。太恶心了。"

'Stubborn as always,' thought Shinji with a sigh.

“一如既往的固执，”真嗣叹息着想。

"We can resume this tomorrow when we actually have daylight. Or would you rather find your way in the dark?"

"我们可以在明天白天光线充足时再继续。或者你宁愿在黑暗中摸索？"

Asuka scowled at him, but heard the reasoning behind this. Still unhappy about this, she turned around to face Shinji and said, "Fine," before walking past him.

明日香对他皱了皱眉，但理解其中的道理。尽管心中不悦，她还是转身面对真嗣，说了声“好吧”，然后从他身边走过。

They made the best of things as they rolled out there sleeping bags in the middle of the road. Shinji didn't want to worry about starting a fire in a building, so sleeping on the asphalt was the best, if not most comfortable, decision. He went around to the buildings that lined the street and grabbed whatever bits of wood he could find to start the fire. With the rain having stopped, getting the fire to light was much easier as well.

他们尽量利用现有条件，在路中央铺开了睡袋。真嗣不想在建筑物内生火，因此睡在柏油路上虽不舒适，却是最佳选择。他绕着街道两旁的建筑物，捡拾能找到的木片来生火。雨已经停了，生火也变得容易许多。

Dinner was nothing special, as it usually was, and afterwards, Asuka lay down on her sleeping bag and let out a low sigh of relief.

晚餐一如既往地普通，饭后，明日香躺在她的睡袋上，发出了一声低沉的叹息，似乎松了口气。

'See, you were tired,' thought Shinji smugly.

“看吧，你就是累了。”真嗣得意地想着。

He was a bit tired himself however, so he lay down on his own. It certainly wasn't the most comfortable, but it would do, and something about sleeping next to the fire again felt right.

他自己也有点累了，于是便躺了下来。虽然这肯定不是最舒服的，但勉强可以，而且再次睡在火堆旁感觉很对。

"Asuka, can I ask you something?"

"明日香，我能问你个问题吗？"

Silence greeted his question for a few seconds until she finally replied.

他的问题问出后，沉默了几秒钟，她终于回答了。

"Fine...what?" “好吧……什么？”

"Is it possible any of the Evangelions are there...at Nerv I mean?"

"那里会不会有任何一台 EVA...我是说在 Nerv？"

Shinji didn't think Asuka was going to reply to this, because she took a long time to reply. Though when she finally did-

真嗣没想到明日香会回答这个问题，因为她花了很长时间才回应。不过当她最终开口时——

"Its not entirely impossible, though unlikely as well."

"并非完全没有可能，尽管同样不太可能。"

"What do you mean?" “你什么意思？”

"I would think you would have figured it out for yourself by now Shinji," said Asuka with an annoyed sigh. "The buildings around are evidence enough for that. Whatever happened here, the best bet would be that the Evangelions had some involvement in it."

"我以为你到现在应该自己想明白了，真嗣。"明日香带着不耐烦的叹息说道，"周围的建筑就是最好的证据。无论这里发生了什么，最有可能的是，这件事与 EVA 有关。"

"But you said that there were three of them."

“但你说过他们有三个人。”

"Yeah," nodded Asuka. "Unit 00 was the First's, and Unit 02 was my own. Unit 01 however didn't have a pilot yet. At least one Evangelion helped with this destruction though, along with the angels as well."

“嗯，”明日香点头道，“零号机是绫波的，二号机是我的。但初号机还没有驾驶员。至少有一台 EVA 参与了这场破坏，还有那些使徒。”

"Then your own and Unit 01 might still be at Nerv then."

“那么你自己的二号机和初号机可能还在 NERV 那里。”

"Maybe," replied Asuka slowly.

“或许吧，”明日香缓缓回答。

In reality though, she wasn't sure of this. If Unit 02 was still at Nerv, then why had she been in her plug suit when she had awoken on the beach. There was still the problem of her missing memory as well, not to mention Shinji's. Her best guess was that she had participated in whatever had happened here, even if she couldn't remember it, and this worried her. What could have happened that affected her memory so badly? There were too many unanswered questions about what had actually happened here in Tokyo-3 and it bothered her.

然而在现实中，她对此并不确定。如果二号机仍在 NERV，那么为何她在海滩上醒来时穿着插入栓服。她缺失的记忆问题依然存在，更不用说真嗣的记忆了。她最好的猜测是，她参与了这里发生的任何事情，即使她记不起来，这让她感到担忧。究竟发生了什么，以至于她的记忆受损如此严重？关于东京-3 这里实际发生的事情，有太多未解之谜，这让她感到困扰。

"Even if any of them are still there, getting to them would be entirely different. With no electricity, the elevators will be down and theres no guarantee that the maintenance access wont have escaped any damage," said Asuka.

"即使他们中还有人留在那里，要找到他们也将是完全不同的挑战。没有电力，电梯会停运，而且无法保证维修通道没有受到任何损坏。" 明日香说道。

"Aren't you at least curious though?" asked Shinji.

“难道你至少不好奇吗？” 真嗣问道。

Was she? Asuka didn't know. She had to see Nerv first though until she could decide what she wanted to do afterwards. She had strong ties to the place afterall, even if she didn't want to admit it. Her life was certainly different now, tied up with the idiot across the fire from her. Maybe she just wanted some finality from her past life. Until she saw Nerv though, she couldn't come to grips with that.

她好奇吗？明日香不知道。她必须先看看 NERV，然后才能决定之后想做什么。毕竟，她与这个地方有着紧密的联系，即使她不想承认。她的生活现在肯定不同了，与火堆对面的那个白痴紧密相连。也许她只是想从过去的生活中找到一些终结。但在看到 NERV 之前，她无法真正面对这一点。

"I don't know," replied Asuka slowly. This was how she actually felt.

“我不知道，”明日香缓缓回答。这是她真实的感受。

Shinji stared across the fire at her, seeing the shadows from the fire dancing across her face. Asuka was caught between some turmoil, that much was obvious. If she didn't want to say whatever it was, then that was fine as well, but Shinji at least hoped that seeing Nerv would alleviate some of this pain.

真嗣隔着火堆凝视着她，火光在她脸上跳跃的影子清晰可见。明摆着，明日香正陷于某种纷扰之中。如果她不想说，那也没关系，但真嗣至少希望看到 NERV 能减轻一些她的痛苦。

"I'm going to sleep," said Asuka as she turned away from him.

“我要睡了，”明日香说着，转过身背对着他。

'Probably best to,' thought Shinji as well. And he was tired.

“或许这样最好，”真嗣也这么想。而且他也累了。

He had his own thoughts about Nerv as well, even if he didn't mention them. Even though he had never been to the place, he felt that so much of his recent life was wrapped up in the place. A part of him even worried that things would change once they got there.

他对 Nerv 也有自己的看法，尽管他从未提及。尽管他从未去过那个地方，但他觉得最近的生活中有太多与那里紧密相连。他甚至担心一旦到达那里，事情会发生改变。

'No sense worrying,' thought Shinji as he rolled over and was out within minutes.

'担心也无济于事，'真嗣想着，翻了个身，几分钟内就睡着了。

Shinji woke up abruptly that next morning as Asuka woke him up by rolling him over with the edge of her foot. As Shinji looked up at her, he could tell that she was in no mood for arguments. He quickly made breakfast, and with that, they were off, just as the sun was beginning to rise. It seemed Asuka planned on finding the maintenance access today, judging by the pace she was setting.

第二天清晨，真嗣被明日香用脚尖猛地一推，突然惊醒。当他抬头看向她时，他能感觉到她此刻毫无争论的心情。他迅速做好了早餐，随后他们便出发了，正好太阳开始升起。从明日香设定的步伐来看，她似乎计划今天找到维修通道。

It was starting to look like a battlefield here as they continued onward into areas of the city Shinji hadn't even seen yet. Buildings on either side of them were little more than heaps of rubble, and once or twice, they saw what appeared to be armored vehicles that had been crushed to dust. It almost looked like a war had broken out or something.

随着他们继续深入真嗣从未见过的城市区域，这里开始变得像战场一样。两侧的建筑物不过是废墟堆，他们还一两次看到了似乎是被碾成尘埃的装甲车。这几乎像是爆发了一场战争似的。

Shinji thought about bringing this up to Asuka, but realized she was in her own world. She was walking with her arms crossed, her head turning many different ways as she took in the environment. Once or twice they stopped so she could figure out where they were. She seemed to have a very good layout of Tokyo-3 already in her mind, even though she hadn't been into the city as much as Shinji had. But again, he had to remind himself, that she probably memorized the layout of the city on orders from Nerv incase something like this did happen.

真嗣考虑过向明日香提起这件事，但他意识到她正沉浸在自己的世界里。她双臂交叉地走着，头不停地转向各个方向，观察着周围的环境。有一两次他们停下来，让她弄清楚他们所在的位置。她似乎已经在脑海中对第三新东京市有了一个很好的布局，尽管她进入这座城市的次数并不如真嗣多。但真嗣不得不提醒自己，她可能是在 NERV 的命令下，为了应对类似情况而记住了城市的布局。

"Hold on," said Asuka as she stopped moving suddenly.

“等等，”明日香突然停下脚步说道。

"What?" said Shinji, suddenly feeling nervous. Was something wrong?

“什么？” 真嗣突然感到紧张。是有什么不对劲吗？

Asuka stood there for a few seconds looking at a store across the street. She seemed to be contemplating something.

明日香站在那里，目光穿过街道望向对面的商店，似乎在沉思着什么。

"Wait here for a second," said Asuka as she started walking towards it.

"在这里等一下，" 明日香说着，开始朝那边走去。

"Shouldn't I-" "我是不是应该-"

"Wait," repeated Asuka with more force in her voice now.

"等等，" 明日香重复道，这次她的声音更加有力。

Shinji was left to stand there with the pack on his shoulders as Asuka walked into the abandoned store. It was more or less intact, but even this didn't put an end to Shinji's worry. What if the roof collapsed suddenly and Asuka was trapped inside...or crushed by the falling debris.

真嗣肩上扛着背包，独自站在那里，看着明日香走进那家废弃的商店。商店大体上还算完好，但即便如此，真嗣的担忧并未因此消散。万一屋顶突然坍塌，明日香被困在里面...或是被坠落的碎片压住怎么办。

Shinji didn't have to worry however, as Asuka walked out moments later, stepping around the fallen glass as she did.

不过，真嗣的担忧并未持续多久，因为明日香很快就走了出来，小心翼翼地绕过地上的碎玻璃。

"Why did you go in by yourself?" asked Shinji the moment that she returned.

"你怎么自己进去了？" 她一回来，真嗣就问道。

"Like you'd know what to look for even if there was a way into Nerv right in front of your face," said Asuka. She continued looking at Shinji however, rather surprised at how annoyed he seemed.

“就算 NERV 的入口就摆在你面前，你也未必知道该找什么。”明日香说道。她继续看着真嗣，对他表现出的恼怒感到有些惊讶。

"Were you worried by any chance?" asked Asuka with a slight laugh.

“你该不会是在担心吧？”明日香带着一丝笑意问道。

Shinji didn't reply, now feeling embarrassed over how he had reacted.

真嗣没有回答，现在他为自己刚才的反应感到尴尬。

"Well, there is an access point in there," said Asuka, ignoring the silence between them.

"嗯，那里有一个接入点，" 明日香说道，忽略了他们之间的沉默。

"Are you sure?" asked Shinji.

"你确定吗？" 真嗣问道。

"Its the only one I used, so yes, I am."

"这是我唯一用过的，所以是的，我确定。"

This surprised Shinji. 这让真嗣感到惊讶。

"You've used it before?" “你以前用过它吗？”

"Yeah, when I first came here. I had a long day of tests and wanted to escape and walk around the city for a while. I used this to escape."

“是的，当我第一次来这里时。我经历了一整天的测试，想要逃离并在这座城市里走走。我用这个逃脱了。”

"Does it take us to Nerv?"

"它能带我们去 Nerv 吗？"

"Not exactly. It'll take us to the Geofront, but from there, we'll have to walk the rest of the way to Nerv. Even so, its better than any other option I can find."

"不完全是。它会带我们到地底都市，但从那里我们得步行到 Nerv。即便如此，这比我能找到的其他任何选项都要好。"

Together, they both walked into the store and Asuka directed him down to the basement where it was. Shinji was rather surprised that it was little more than a manhole covering a ladder. Though as Asuka explained, this was incase all electricity went out in the city. It may be rudimentary, but it did work. She was also very adamant about her going first and Shinji afterwards. Shinji didn't think this made any sense, as he was the one carrying the pack, and if he lost his footing, then they would both fall. Asuka wasn't budging on this however.

他们一起走进商店，Asuka 领着他下到地下室。Shinji 对这不过是一个盖着梯子的井盖感到相当惊讶。但正如 Asuka 解释的那样，这是为了防止城市电力完全中断。虽然原始，但确实有效。她还非常坚持要自己先下去，Shinji 随后。Shinji 觉得这毫无道理，因为他才是背着背包的人，如果他失足，两人都会摔倒。然而 Asuka 在这点上毫不让步。

They slowly started descending the ladder. Down and down it went until darkness completely engulfed them. Shinji was taking his time finding the next placement for his foot. His greatest fear was that he would suddenly find that there wasn't anymore ladder.

他们缓缓开始下梯子。梯子一节节向下延伸，直到黑暗完全吞噬了他们。真嗣小心翼翼地寻找着下一个落脚点。他最害怕的是突然发现梯子已经到头了。

Asuka seemed to be fine, maybe because she had already done this before, but she started taking it slower as well as they continued downwards. How far had they come? They were certainly far underneath Tokyo-3 by now.

明日香似乎很从容，也许因为她以前做过类似的事，但随着他们继续向下，她也放慢了速度。他们已经下到了多深的地方？现在肯定已经远在第三新东京市的地下了。

Just as Shinji wondering if this was ever going to stop, Asuka called a stop. They hadn't stopped at all or said anything since the descent, so this came as something of a surprise to Shinji.

正当真嗣疑惑这会不会没完没了时，明日香喊了停。自从开始下降以来，他们一直没有停下或说过话，这让真嗣感到有些意外。

"What is it?" asked Shinji.

"这是什么？" 真嗣问道。

"Hand me the lighter," said Asuka.

"把打火机递给我，" 明日香说。

Shinji dug it out of his pocket and handed it to her. Asuka flicked it on and looked down below. There was a slight drop, maybe ten feet or so. Simple enough. Problem was, Asuka new it wasn't like this the first time she had used the ladder. Bending down to look at the end of the ladder, she saw that it had been cleanly cut by something. She bit her lips in frustration. Certainly nobody had been down here since Tokyo-3 had become a wasteland, so the only thing that made sense was that somebody had done this during whatever had happened in Tokyo-3.

真嗣从口袋里掏出它，递给了她。明日香轻按开关，低头望去。下方有个小落差，大约十英尺左右。简单得很。问题是，明日香清楚记得第一次使用这梯子时并非如此。她弯腰查看梯子的末端，发现它被某种东西整齐地切断了。她懊恼地咬了咬嘴唇。自东京-3 沦为废墟以来，显然无人踏足此地，因此唯一合理的解释是，在东京-3 发生的某次事件中，有人动了手脚。

'Is it possible the government intervened in Nerv for some reason?' thought Asuka. They had certainly seen vehicles that looked military like, and even the battleships that littered the bay of Tokyo-3 came to mind. She chose not to tell any of this to Shinji however.

"政府会不会出于某种原因介入了 NERV？"明日香暗自思忖。他们的确见过那些看似军用的车辆，甚至连散布在第三新东京湾的战舰也浮现在脑海中。但她决定不把这些告诉真嗣。

"Its a bit of a drop," said Asuka as she looked up the ladder at him.

"这有点陡峭，" 明日香抬头看着梯子上的他说道。

"How much is a bit?"

"多少算有点？"

"Ten feet." "十英尺。"

Shinji felt slight relief from that. Ten feet wasn't bad, though the pack would weigh him down slightly.

这让真嗣感到些许宽慰。十英尺不算太糟，尽管背包会让他稍微有些负担。

Moments later, Asuka jumped and landed easily at the bottom. Turning around, she directed the light to Shinji so he could see where he was jumping. He jumped, though not as gracefully as Asuka had, and landed with a thud as the pack brought him down on his butt. Asuka had to suppress a grin as she walked over to him and held out a hand to help him up.

片刻后，明日香轻松地跳下并稳稳落地。她转身将灯光照向真嗣，以便他能看清跳跃点。他跳了下去，虽然没有明日香那般优雅，落地时背包让他一屁股坐到了地上。明日香强忍笑意，走过去向他伸出手，帮助他起身。

"That was a funny flail," said Asuka with a smirk.

“刚才那下乱挥挺滑稽的。”明日香带着一丝戏谑说道。

Shinji didn't reply, feeling that his pride was somehow hurt. Something else bothered him however.

真嗣没有回答，感觉自己的自尊心受到了某种伤害。然而，还有其他事情困扰着他。

"Didn't your ankle hurt from that Asuka?"

“你的脚踝不疼吗，从那次被明日香踩了之后？”

"Not really, I placed most of my weight on my other foot."

“其实还好，我把大部分重量都放在另一只脚上了。”

Shinji was again surprised at how athletic Asuka seemed to be.

真嗣再次惊讶于明日香的运动能力。

They walked forward now, Asuka leading with the lighter. She seemed to know exactly which way to go now. They turned down several hallways all having adjacent hallways which led off in different directions. Shinji knew that if he had tried this himself, he would have been lost right at the start.

他们现在向前走去，明日香拿着打火机带路。她似乎知道确切的方向。他们转过几个走廊，每个走廊都有相邻的通道通向不同的方向。真嗣知道，如果他自己尝试，一开始就会迷路。

They rounded another corner and Asuka led them to a door. Trying to turn the door knob had no affect however. Setting down his pack, Shinji walked over and pushed against it, throwing his weight against the door. Asuka did likewise, and they got the door open. Darkness greeted them again, and Asuka led the way down the stairwell.

他们又转过一个拐角，明日香带他们来到一扇门前。试图转动门把手却没有效果。真嗣放下背包，走过去用力推门，将全身重量压在门上。明日香也照做，门终于被打开了。黑暗再次迎接他们，明日香领着大家走下楼梯。

"Where is this taking us?" asked Shinji.

“这是要带我们去哪儿？”真嗣问道。

"The Geofront...or it should unless something happened," said Asuka.

“地底都市……除非出了什么状况，否则应该就是这里。”明日香回答道。

They went down several more flights of stairs until they reached another door. This one opened quite easily, and Shinji and Asuka walked out into the Geofront.

他们又下了几层楼梯，直到抵达另一扇门。这扇门轻易地打开了，真嗣和明日香便走进了地底都市。

Shinji was momentarily blinded as he walked out, and had to shield his eyes with his hand as the sun beat down on him. It took Shinji several seconds for the absurdity of this thought to take hold, but as he looked up, he saw where the sun was coming from. A gaping hole opened up above the Geofront, letting sunlight rain into the underground facility. Shinji marveled at this for several seconds until he turned to Asuka and saw the surprised look on her face.

走出时，真嗣一时被阳光刺得睁不开眼，不得不用手遮挡。他花了好几秒才意识到这个想法的荒谬，但当他抬头时，看到了阳光的来源。一个巨大的洞口在 Geofront 上方敞开，让阳光洒入地下设施。真嗣对此惊叹了几秒，直到他转向明日香，看到了她脸上的惊讶表情。

"What is it?" he asked.

“怎么了？”他问道。

"That hole...isn't supposed to be there," she mumbled.

“那个洞……不应该在那里的，”她喃喃道。

"What do you mean?" “你什么意思？”

"Reinforced layers cover the entirety of the Geofront so that it isn't supposed to be penetrated from anything."

加固层覆盖了整个 Geofront，因此它不应该被任何东西穿透。

"Then what did it?" asked Shinji.

“那到底是什么？”真嗣问道。

Asuka was silent, but the only thing she knew that could do something like that was an N2 bomb. Again, the thought that the government had interfered somehow started to grow on her mind. But that was in the past.

明日香沉默不语，但她唯一知道能造成这种效果的东西是 N2 炸弹。再次，她心中政府可能介入的想法开始滋生。但那都是过去的事了。

"C'mon," said Asuka as she ignored Shinji's question.

“快点，”明日香说着，对真嗣的问题置若罔闻。

They walked along the path, getting closer to Nerv. Shinji was surprised to see that there was grass down here as well as trees and when he asked Asuka about this, she said it had something to do with terraforming.

他们沿着小径前行，逐渐接近 NERV 总部。真嗣惊讶地发现这里也有草地和树木，当他向明日香询问时，她解释说这与地球化改造有关。

As they passed more trees, the lake came into view, as well as the headquarters of Nerv. Shinji stood on a hill overlooking everything and marveled that human engineering could make something like this. The lake in the middle of course was filled with the LCL fluid, but Nerv looked more or less intact.

随着他们穿过更多的树木，湖面和 NERV 总部映入眼帘。真嗣站在山丘上俯瞰这一切，惊叹于人类工程能创造出这样的景象。当然，湖中充满了 LCL 液体，但 NERV 总部看起来大致完好无损。

"Is that it then?" asked Shinji as he pointed to the pyramid shaped building.

“那就是了吗？”真嗣指着金字塔形的建筑问道。

"Yeah," replied Asuka. "Thats the headquarters of Nerv."

“嗯，”明日香回答道，“那是 NERV 的总部。”

The structure was exactly in the shape of a pyramid, but entirely black and very smooth it seemed. Directly next to it was the lake filled with the LCL fluid. Shinji and Asuka followed the path down to the lake and refilled their water bottles first before continuing onward.

这座建筑完全呈金字塔形状，但通体漆黑且异常光滑。紧邻其旁的是一个充满 LCL 液体的湖泊。真嗣和明日香沿着小径下到湖边，先给水壶重新装满水，然后继续前行。

As they neared the giant pyramid however, Shinji had to ask something.

然而，当他们接近那座巨大的金字塔时，真嗣不得不提出一个问题。

"How exactly are we supposed to get in there?"

“我们究竟该怎么进去呢？”

Asuka stopped in her tracks; she hadn't thought of that in all honesty. Just getting to the Geofront seemed difficult enough as it was.

明日香突然停下脚步；老实说，她从未考虑过这一点。光是到达地底都市就已经够困难的了。

"Without power, I'm not entirely sure. Though there should be a side entrance somewhere we can use."

“没有电力，我不太确定。不过应该有个侧门我们可以利用。”

"How long were you here for exactly?" asked Shinji, slightly accusingly.

“你到底在这里待了多久？”真嗣略带责备地问道。

"One week or so," said Asuka. 'Or more,' she later thought. 'Depends on if you include the memory loss.'

"大约一周吧，" 明日香说道。'或者更久，' 她随后想道。'取决于你是否把失忆的时间也算进去。'

"Well, I'll think about that in a minute though. Lunch sounds good right now."

"嗯，这个我一会儿再考虑。现在吃午饭听起来不错。"

Shinji had to agree, so he started pulling stuff out of the backpack to cook with. They ate lunch just above the lake, sitting on a slope that overlooked it. It was nice down here Shinji had to admit, even though they were several hundred feet underground. Considering that there were trees and grass down here, unlike above the surface, Shinji could get used to living here. Though whether Asuka would agree with him on this remained to be seen.

真嗣不得不承认，于是他开始从背包里拿出烹饪用的东西。他们在湖边上方的一个斜坡上吃午饭，坐在那里可以俯瞰湖面。真嗣不得不承认，尽管他们身处地下几百英尺，但这里确实很美。考虑到这里有树木和草地，与地表不同，真嗣可以习惯在这里生活。不过明日香是否同意他的看法，还有待观察。

After eating, Asuka seemed to have made a decision on there next course, so they set back off along the path. They walked for what felt like another hour until they reached a small outpost set up along a road. It was gated, and had scanners and cameras along the side. Asuka looked into the outpost, but didn't see anything of use. The gate was large, but not large enough that they could jump it. Asuka climbed first and reached the top, allowing Shinji to toss the pack to her so she could drop it over the other side. Shinji then followed her lead, and jumped onto the other side.

饭后，明日香似乎已决定接下来的路线，于是他们沿着小径重新出发。步行了约莫又一个小时，他们抵达了一处沿路设立的小哨站。哨站设有大门，两侧配备了扫描仪和摄像头。明日香仔细观察了哨站，却未发现任何有用的信息。大门虽宽，却不足以让他们跳跃而过。明日香率先攀爬至顶端，示意真嗣将背包抛给她，以便她能将其扔到另一侧。随后，真嗣也效仿她的动作，成功跃至大门另一边。

Asuka told him that even though the power wasn't working, most of the gated entry ways into Nerv had manual overrides that could be used in dire situations. If this wasn't a time to use them, Shinji didn't know what was.

明日香告诉他，尽管电源失效，Nerv 的大部分门禁入口都设有手动应急装置，以备紧急情况使用。如果这都不算紧急时刻，真嗣不知道还有什么算。

Off to the side, just in front of the large metal door that was apparently part of D block was one of these manual overrides. It was a metal door with the word 'emergency access' splashed across it in big red letters. Upon the door was a large hand crank that Asuka tried first, but it took their combined strength to open the door. Shinji guessed that this wasn't something fifteen year olds were supposed to be using.

在旁边，就在那扇显然属于 D 区的大金属门前，有一个这样的手动应急装置。这是一扇金属门，上面用大红字母写着‘紧急出口’。门上有一个大手摇柄，明日香先试了试，但需要他们合力才能打开门。真嗣猜想，这不是十五岁少年应该使用的东西。

Darkness engulfed them again, and Asuka lit the lighter again, giving them a faint ray of light that led them forward. They were in a very narrow hallway now, and were forced to walk single file until they came to another of the emergency access doors. They opened it again and Shinji looked up to the large ceiling that folded out above him.

黑暗再次吞噬了他们，明日香再次点燃打火机，为他们提供了一束微弱的光线，引领他们前行。现在他们身处一条非常狭窄的走廊，只能单列行进，直到他们遇到另一扇紧急出口门。他们再次打开门，真嗣抬头望向那展开在他头顶的巨大天花板。

"This is something like a hub I guess you could call it," said Asuka. "The walk ways usually move on there own, directing people to where they want to go and they branch off in different directions as well. Science labs, research labs, offices, medical facilities, all have there own area. The elevators of course also add to the transportation."

“这有点像一个枢纽，我想你可以这么称呼它，”明日香说道，“通常走道会自行移动，引导人们前往他们想去的地方，并且还会分支出不同的方向。科学实验室、研究实验室、办公室、医疗设施，都有各自的区域。当然，电梯也增加了交通的便利性。”

"How many people actually worked here."

"这里到底有多少人真正工作过。"

"Not sure," said Asuka truthfully. "I only knew a handful of people that worked here, but I'm sure that it took a thousand or so workers just to run this place as well as the Geofront."

“不确定，”明日香如实说道，“我只认识这里工作的少数几个人，但我确信，光是维持这个地方和地底都市的运作，就需要上千名工人。”

It felt weird to think that people were going about there daily lives in a facility this large not even two months ago. Shinji wondered if his father hadn't walked this very same path at one point.

想到不到两个月前，人们还在这样一个庞大的设施中过着日常的生活，真让人感到奇怪。真嗣不禁思索，他的父亲是否也曾走过这条路。

"So where exactly are we going first then?" asked Shinji.

“那么，我们首先去哪里呢？”真嗣问道。

"Ideally, it would be the command center, but reaching it would be difficult. I know there is a ladder that leads there somewhere, though I'm not sure where it would be. Next it would be the Evangelions chamber I guess."

"理想情况下，应该是指挥中心，但到达那里会很困难。我知道某个地方有一架梯子通向那里，虽然我不确定具体位置。接下来，我想应该是 EVA 的机库吧。"

"Aren't those several levels higher than we are though?"

"那些不是比我们所在的位置高出好几层吗？"

"I'm surprise you remembered. Yeah, they are, though I remember well enough how to get there. There was one other thing I figured I'd show you."

"你居然还记得，真让我惊讶。是的，它们确实高几层，不过我清楚记得怎么上去。还有一件事我想带你去看。"

"What?" “什么？”

"The commanders office," said Asuka simply.

"指挥官的办公室," 明日香简单地说道。

Shinji had to do a double take at that, and for a minute he wasn't sure what to say.

这让真嗣不得不再次确认，一时间他不知道该说什么。

"Are you surprised?" asked Asuka.

"你感到惊讶吗？" 明日香问道。

"A little...yeah," replied Shinji slowly. "Why did you to decide to show me that?"

"有点...嗯，" 真嗣缓缓回答，"你为什么要决定给我看那个？"

"I thought that it would be good for you to see where your father spent most of his time."

"我想让你看看你父亲大部分时间待的地方，这对你有好处。"

"You've been there before?"

"你去过那里吗？"

"Once," said Asuka. "When I first came here, my guardian brought me before him."

"曾经，" 明日香说道，"我刚来这里的时候，我的监护人带我去见了他。"

Shinji was still looking at her strangely however, and Asuka could feel her patience running thin.

然而，真嗣仍然奇怪地看着她，明日香能感觉到她的耐心正在耗尽。

"What!?" she snapped at him.

"什么！？" 她冲他吼道。

"No...sorry, still surprised is all that you would consider showing me something like that."

"不...抱歉，我只是还有点惊讶，你居然会考虑给我看那种东西。"

Asuka didn't like his tone, so she retorted angry, "What? You don't want to see it?"

明日香不喜欢他的语气，于是生气地反驳道：“什么？你不想看吗？”

"I do...but thinking about me is strange coming from you I guess."

"我确实...但这种话从你嘴里说出来，感觉挺奇怪的。"

Shinji said these feelings honestly, as it seemed that Asuka rarely did seem to have Shinji's interests on her mind. She normally just said or did whatever she pleased and didn't worry about what he would think. Seeing her considering his thoughts about his father was a bit of a surprise to Shinji.

真嗣坦率地说出了这些感受，因为似乎明日香很少会把真嗣的利益放在心上。她通常只是随心所欲地说或做，并不担心他会怎么想。看到她考虑他对父亲的看法，对真嗣来说有点意外。

Asuka wasn't too pleased by Shinji's response however, because she hit him in the arm and said, "Just because I'm not constantly badgering you about your feelings doesn't mean I don't listen! This place holds significance to you as well, so of course I'd think to show you your fathers office!"

然而，明日香对真嗣的回答并不太满意，因为她打了一下他的手臂，说道：“只是因为我没有一直追问你的感受，并不意味着我没在听！这个地方对你也很重要，所以我当然会想到带你去看你父亲的办公室！”

"Okay, okay," said Shinji, trying to avoid an argument. Even though he had stated his surprise over Asuka's decision to show him where his father worked, he was touched by her consideration in his feelings. He hadn't thought about asking about this in the first place, as it seemed Asuka had her own things she was dealing with, and Shinji didn't want to get in the way of those. He was curious about his fathers work, even though he didn't say anything. So getting to see where he spent most of his time was nice at least.

"好了，好了，" 真嗣说道，试图避免一场争执。尽管他对明日香决定带他去看父亲工作的地方表示了惊讶，但他被她的体贴所感动。他原本没想过要问这件事，因为明日香似乎有自己的事情要处理，真嗣不想妨碍她。他对父亲的工作感到好奇，尽管他没有说出口。所以至少能亲眼看到父亲大部分时间所待的地方，还是不错的。

"Are you coming, or are you going to stand there all day?" asked Asuka who was several paces in front of him. She seemed to be slightly grumpy.

“你来不来，还是打算在那儿站一整天？”明日香在他前方几步远的地方问道，看起来有点儿不高兴。

Shinji hurried forward to walk alongside Asuka and said, "Thank you."

真嗣快步上前，与明日香并肩而行，说道：“谢谢你。”

"Say your thanks after you've seen his office. Its not the most heartwarming."

“等你看了他的办公室再说感谢吧。那地方可不怎么温馨。”

Shinji nodded silently, wondering what she meant by that.

真嗣默默点头，心中疑惑她此言何意。

They followed the walkways for a while in silence, Asuka leading the way. Eventually, they branched off down a hallway, and then another. It was at this point that Asuka called for a stop, as she saw something darkened on the floor.

他们默默地沿着步道走了一会儿，由明日香带路。最终，他们拐进了一条走廊，接着又是一条。就在这时，明日香叫停了，因为她看到地板上有东西变暗了。

"Hold on Shinji," said Asuka as she held the lighter out in front of her, looking at the floor in front of her.

“等等，真嗣，”明日香说着，将打火机伸向前方，盯着她面前的地板。

"What is it?" he asked, not able to see whatever it was she was looking at.

“那是什么？”他问道，看不见她正在看的东西。

Asuka bent down, and ran her finger over the substance. It was impossible to mistaken the color, and even though it had dried, it still had a sickly red look.

明日香弯下腰，用手指轻触那物质。颜色不可能认错，尽管已经干涸，它依然呈现出一种病态的红色。

"Blood," said Asuka heavily.

"血，"明日香沉重地说道。

"Blood?" asked Shinji confused. "What do you mean?"

"血？"真嗣困惑地问，"你是什么意思？"

Asuka stared down at the dark patch of blood, already dried onto the metal floor. It seemed that her suspicions were correct.

明日香盯着那块深色的血迹，已经干涸在金属地板上。看来她的怀疑是正确的。

"Something I didn't tell you about before Shinji. When we came down the first ladder leading from the surface to the Geofront, the last bit was cut by a saw blade of some kind. It was fine when I climbed it originally, but now its broken. I wondered why that would be. After this though, it seems apparent that the government attacked Nerv at some point."

“有件事我之前没告诉过你，真嗣。当我们从地表下到地底都市的第一段梯子时，最后一段是被某种锯片切断的。我最初爬的时候还好好的，但现在断了。我想知道为什么会这样。不过现在看来，很明显政府在某一刻攻击了 NERV。”

"Attacked...what do you-"

"遭到攻击...你对此有何-"

"Think about the vehicles we saw on are way here, as well as the large hole in the Geofront. I'm sure that the angels were part of this, but the military seemed to have been mobilized against Nerv as well."

"想想我们来这里的路上看到的那些车辆，还有地底都市的大洞。我确信天使与此有关，但军方似乎也对 Nerv 采取了行动。"

"Why would they do that?"

"他们为何要这么做？"

"Not everyone in the government agreed with what Nerv did, or believed that the angels were even real. Some of them saw Nerv as a dangerous corporation, and the Evangelions as demons. Though to go this far..."

并非所有政府成员都赞同 Nerv 的所作所为，或者相信天使的存在。有些人视 Nerv 为一个危险的公司，将 EVA 视为恶魔。尽管如此，做到这种地步……

Asuka wondered just how many had died before Third Impact had been initiated.

明日香想知道在第三次冲击启动之前，究竟有多少人丧生。

Shinji now stood beside her and looked at the dark stain on the ground. It was impossible to mistaken it as something else. Even in the light from the lighter, the blood still had a certain sheen to it.

真嗣现在站在她旁边，看着地上的暗色污渍。这不可能被误认为是其他东西。即使在打火机的微弱光线下，那血迹依然泛着某种光泽。

"Lets go," said Asuka, "Theres no point lingering here, and we should be getting close to where the ladder is for the Evangelions."

“走吧，”明日香说道，“在这里逗留毫无意义，我们应该快接近放置 EVA 的梯子了。”

"Okay," mumbled Shinji, taking one last look at the blood before he followed her.

“好吧，”真嗣咕哝着，最后看了一眼血迹，然后跟着她走了。

It didn't take long until Asuka found the ladder that would take them up to the Evangelions floor. This time, Asuka made Shinji go before her, and this time, he was starting to get an idea why. Though in all honesty, what reason did she think he had for looking up at her ass while they were climbing up. It made no sense really.

没过多久，明日香就找到了通往 EVA 机库的梯子。这次，明日香让真嗣先上，而这次，他开始有点明白为什么了。不过说实话，她以为他有什么理由在爬梯子时盯着她的屁股看呢？这根本说不通。

As he reached the top, Shinji waited for Asuka to appear so that he could see. Though he was starting to get used to the lack of light, having the lighter still made a large difference.

当他到达顶端时，真嗣等待着明日香的出现，以便他能看见。虽然他开始习惯了缺乏光线的环境，但打火机的存在仍然带来了巨大的差异。

After Asuka reached the top, she flicked the lighter on and walked around a corner to where the door for the Evangelions were stored. Here, the fighting seemed to be some of the worst, as there was blood spilled across so much of the floor that little of the original whiteness could be seen. Shinji tried not to look down at this, or vomit, so he instead focused on the flame in front of him.

在明日香到达顶端后，她点燃了打火机，绕过一个拐角，来到了存放福音战士的门前。这里，战斗似乎是最为惨烈的，因为地板上洒满了鲜血，几乎看不到原本的白色。真嗣尽量不去看脚下，以免呕吐，所以他转而专注于眼前的火焰。

Though Asuka knew that the door wouldn't open, she still tried pressing her weight against it, hoping that it might have gotten damaged at some point during the fighting. No luck however, as she gave up after the third attempt.

尽管明日香知道门不会打开，她还是试图用体重去推它，希望在战斗中它可能已经受损。然而，没有运气，她在第三次尝试后放弃了。

"What now?" asked Shinji.

“现在怎么办？”真嗣问道。

"Give me a second," said Asuka as she tilted her head slightly.

"给我一点时间," 明日香说着，微微侧了侧头。

She thought for almost a minute, just starring at the door in front of her. It was impossible to break through the door, that much was sure.

她思考了近一分钟，只是盯着面前的门。要破门而入是不可能的，这一点很确定。

"The ventilation duct may work," whispered Asuka as she thought about this.

"通风管道或许可行," 明日香低声说道，同时思考着这个方案。

"Huh?" muttered Shinji. "嗯？" 真嗣咕哝道。

"I think I thought of something," said Asuka as she turned around and started walking back down the hallway they had just come from. Instead of turning right however, where the ladder they had just come, she continued down the hallway and turned left. There was a ventilation duct there with a large quantity of blood slopped around it and even on the walls next to it. Whats more, the cover had already been taken off the duct.

"我想到了点什么，" 明日香说着转过身，开始沿着他们刚走过的走廊往回走。然而，她并没有向右转，那里是他们刚爬下来的梯子所在，而是继续沿着走廊走，然后向左转。那里有一个通风管道，周围洒满了大量血迹，甚至溅到了旁边的墙上。更重要的是，通风管道的盖子已经被移开了。

Getting down on her hands and knees, Asuka looked into the duct with the light before standing up again.

明日香跪下用手和膝盖支撑着身体，用灯光照进管道里查看，然后又站了起来。

"A little small, but it should take us directly over the Evangelions chamber."

"有点小，但它应该能直接带我们飞越 EVA 的机库。"

Shinji was more worried about the blood around the duct though. It was ominous for some reason.

但真嗣更担心通风管周围的血迹。不知为何，这显得很不祥。

"You go first," said Asuka as she held the lighter out for him.

"你先走，"明日香说着，把打火机递给他。"

Shinji took it wordlessly, not bothering to question Asuka's logic, and bent down to start crawling. It was then that it hit him. Something seared into his mind, penetrated it. Something...no somebody. An image? A person? Shinji felt pain suddenly and wanted to cry out. Everything was red, even the persons jacket. What was it? Death was hovering in place. Words were spoken, but Shinji couldn't hear them. He wanted to say something, but his mouth wasn't working. His body wasn't under his control. Blood continued seeping out and pooling next to the body. Shadows appeared, hovering over the body. Words again were spoken; the shadows left. Or did they die too? No...later...later. Shinji couldn't do anything as he watched life disappear. Something else though...another voice? Something familiar it seemed. From the ventilation duct? No, that seemed impossible. Who could be speaking to him from there.

真嗣默默接过，懒得质疑明日香的理由，弯腰开始爬行。就在这时，他突然感到一阵冲击。某种东西烙印在他的脑海，穿透了他的意识。某种...不，某个人。是影像？还是人？真嗣突然感到疼痛，想要呼喊。一切都是红色的，甚至连那人的夹克也是。那是什么？死亡就在那里徘徊。有人说话，但真嗣听不见。他想说些什么，但嘴巴不听使唤。他的身体不受控制。鲜血继续渗出，汇聚在尸体旁。阴影出现，笼罩着尸体。又有人说话；阴影离开了。还是他们也死了？不...稍后...稍后。真嗣无能为力，只能眼睁睁看着生命消逝。但还有别的...另一个声音？似乎很熟悉。从通风管道传来的？不，这似乎不可能。谁会从那里对他说话呢？

Sharp pain jolted him out of the vision. Everything was muffled, but his hearing was starting to come back. What had just happened to him?

剧烈的疼痛将他从幻象中惊醒。一切都是模糊的，但他的听力开始恢复。刚刚发生了什么？

"Oi!? What are you doing? Move the fuck forward!" shouted Asuka from behind Shinji.

“喂！你在干嘛？快他妈往前爬！”明日香在真嗣身后喊道。

"What?" said Shinji, still dazed from whatever had happened.

"什么？" 真嗣说道，仍然对刚才发生的事情感到茫然。

Asuka kicked him again, just as she had done moments ago to wake him.

明日香又踢了他一脚，就像刚才为了叫醒他那样。

"Why are you just kneeling there!? Get moving!"

"你为什么只是跪在那里！？快动起来！"

"Oh...sorry..." said Shinji, still heavily confused.

“哦...抱歉...” 真嗣说道，依旧深陷困惑之中。

"Jeez...what were you doing just sitting there. Dreaming?"

"天哪...你就这么坐在那儿，做梦呢？"

'Maybe I was,' thought Shinji. Though as he looked down at the dried blood that his hand was pressed to, he wasn't entirely sure. Whether what he had really seen had happened right here, he pushed it all to the back of his mind. It wasn't something to dwell on.

“或许我是吧，”真嗣心想。然而，当他低头看着自己手掌所按着的干涸血迹时，他并不完全确定。究竟他所真正目睹的那些是否真的发生在此地，他将其统统抛诸脑后。这不是该深究的事情。

They slowly crawled through the duct, Shinji leading this time until he stopped and spoke to Asuka behind him.

他们缓缓爬过通风管道，这次由真嗣领头，直到他停下并转身对身后的明日香说话。

"I think I reached the end," he said.

“我想我到尽头了，”他说。

"What do you see?" “你看到了什么？”

"Not much really." “没什么特别的。”

"Well look harder then," retorted Asuka angrily.

“那就再仔细看看，”明日香生气地反驳道。

Shinji bit back the retort he wanted to throw, but did what she told him. He perched on the edge of the duct, and peered over, waving the lighter as he did so. The drop actually wasn't that bad, about as much as it had been with the ladder. Without bothering to mention this to Asuka, he dropped right down and out of her sight. Landing on the ground, Shinji turned around just as Asuka looked out of the duct at him. She did not seem happy.

真嗣忍住了想要回嘴的冲动，但还是照她说的做了。他蹲在通风口边缘，探头向下看去，同时挥动着打火机。实际上，这个高度并不算糟糕，和之前用梯子时差不多。真嗣没有向明日香提及这一点，直接跳了下去，消失在她的视线中。落地后，真嗣转过身，正好看到明日香从通风口探出头来看他。她的表情显然不太高兴。

"You could have mentioned you were going to jump you fucking idiot," yelled Asuka.

“你他妈的蠢货，本可以提前说你要跳的！”明日香吼道。

"Worried?" asked Shinji. "担心吗？" 真嗣问道。

It was Asuka's turn to be embarrassed, and she didn't say anything as she jumped down. Landing rather awkwardly on her foot. Shinji had to stifle a grin at that.

轮到明日香感到尴尬了，她什么也没说就跳了下来，落地时脚显得相当笨拙。真嗣不得不忍住笑意。

"Gimme that," said Asuka as she snatched the lighter out of his hand and started walking around.

"给我那个，" 明日香说着从他手中夺过打火机，开始四处走动。

She held the lighter up high, peering around the large chamber. Shinji walked several steps behind her, looking at everything around him. The chamber was quite large. Though as he continued walking, he noticed something-

她高举着打火机，环视着这个巨大的洞穴。真嗣跟在她身后几步远，四处张望着。这个洞穴相当宽敞。然而，随着他继续前行，他注意到了一些东西——

"None of the Evangelions are here," said Shinji as he looked at one of the many empty spaces.

“这里没有一台 EVA，”真嗣看着众多空旷处之一说道。

"As I figured," said Asuka.

“正如我所料，”明日香说道。

"What about Unit 01? I thought you said it didn't have a pilot."

"那零壹号机呢？我记得你说过它没有驾驶员。"

"Not that I knew of at least," said Asuka with a sideways glance at Shinji.

""至少据我所知是没有的，""明日香斜眼瞥了真嗣一眼说道。

"You don't seem surprised that none of them are here?"

"你看起来对它们都不在这里并不感到惊讶？"

"I'm not honestly," said Asuka.

"我真的没有，" 明日香说道。

"Then what was the point of coming here?"

"那我们来这里的意义何在？"

Asuka didn't reply as she looked at an empty spot in the chamber. Shinji walked over to where she stood and looked up the edge. The orange like LCL fluid seemed to fill the entire chamber from the bottom, up to the gangways.

明日香没有回答，只是凝视着室内的一处空地。真嗣走到她身边，抬头望向边缘。橙色的 LCL 液体似乎从底部一直填满了整个房间，直达通道。

"This is where my Evangelion would have stood if it were here," mumbled Asuka.

“如果在这里的话，我的 EVA 原本应该站在这个位置，”明日香喃喃自语。

"Unit 02?" asked Shinji. “二号机？”真嗣问道。

"Yeah," sighed Asuka. “嗯，”明日香叹了口气。

"Is it possible that it is lost in the city somewhere?"

"会不会是遗失在城市的某个角落了？"

"Considering that the Evangelions are larger than most skyscrapers, unlikely. No, it was most likely destroyed somehow."

"考虑到 EVA 比大多数摩天大楼还要大，不太可能。不，它很可能是被某种方式摧毁了。"

Shinji could hear the hurt in Asuka's voice and was reminded again just how much being an Evangelion pilot meant to her.

真嗣能听出明日香声音中的痛苦，这让他再次意识到成为 EVA 驾驶员对她意味着什么。

"How do we get out of here?" asked Shinji.

“我们怎么出去？” 真嗣问道。

"Service ladder over there," said Asuka as she pointed to a far corner. "It should take us to the level directly above your fathers office."

“那边的维修梯，” 明日香指着远处的一个角落说，“应该能带我们到你父亲办公室的上一层。”

Shinji watched her silently for several seconds as she continued looking up at the empty where Unit 02 once stood.

真嗣默默地注视了她几秒钟，她继续抬头望着二号机曾经所在的那片空旷。

"Asuka," he started, "we can stay here longer if you want to..."

"明日香，" 他开口道，"如果你想的话，我们可以在这里多待一会儿..."

"No...thats okay Shinji. Just being here and seeing that its not here is okay. I never had much hope in the first place. Though thanks for the thought."

"不了...这样就好，真嗣。只是在这里，看到它不在，就够了。我本来也没抱太大希望。不过还是谢谢你的心意。"

Asuka turned to him and give him a small smile, before walking away from part of her past life.

明日香转向他，给了他一个浅浅的微笑，然后离开了她过去生活的一部分。

Shinji thought the smile was sad though.

尽管如此，真嗣觉得那微笑带着一丝哀伤。

After they reached the next floor above the Evangelions, Asuka led him down several hallways until they reach a maintenance stairwell that ran parallel alongside the elevator. Following this up several flights of stairs, they came into another hallway that seemed much smaller than others. Walking down it a ways, Asuka eventually stopped at a pair of double doors.

在他们到达初号机所在楼层的上一层后，明日香带着他穿过几条走廊，直到他们到达一个与电梯并行的维修楼梯。沿着这个楼梯爬了几层，他们进入了一条看起来比其他地方小得多的走廊。走了一段路后，明日香最终在一对双开门前停了下来。

"This is it," said Asuka.

“就是这里了。”明日香说道。

Shinji looked at the doors for several seconds before he turned the knob on one of them. It opened easily. As he went to step inside however, he noticed that Asuka was leaning against the wall directly next to the door.

真嗣盯着那扇门看了好几秒，然后才转动其中一扇门的把手。门轻易地开了。然而，当他正要踏进去时，注意到明日香正靠在门旁边的墙上。

"Aren't you going inside?" he asked her.

“你不进去吗？”他问她。

"No, I'll stay here and wait for you. This is more something that I think you should do on your own."

“不，我在这里等你。我觉得这事儿你还是自己去做比较好。”

"Won't it be dark out here though?"

"但这里不会很暗吗？"

"Leave the lighter with me then. You should be able to see fine in there."

"那就把打火机留给我吧。你在里面应该能看得很清楚。"

Shinji was confused by this statement, but he listened to her all the same. Leaving Asuka outside, he walked into his fathers office.

真嗣对这句话感到困惑，但他还是听了她的话。留下明日香在外面，他走进了父亲的办公室。

It wasn't like what he had imagined certainly, but he understood now what Asuka had said that he wouldn't need the lighter. Windows lined the side all along the office, letting in sunlight from the outside. Other than that, almost everything else was pitch black. The carpet, the ceiling, even parts of the wall were black. The only thing in the room was a desk set in the middle of it.

这确实不像他想象中的样子，但他现在明白了明日香所说的他不需要打火机的意思。办公室的一侧排列着窗户，让外面的阳光洒进来。除此之外，几乎所有其他东西都是漆黑的。地毯、天花板，甚至部分墙壁都是黑色。房间里唯一的家具是一张摆在中间的桌子。

Shinji walked over to it and ran his hand over the surface, wondering when last his father had been here. He walked behind and sat down in the chair, looking at everything on the desk. It was remarkably clear of anything except a single piece of paper with what looked like a drawing of an upside down triangle and multiple eyes looking out. Shinji thought about pocketing this briefly, but decided not to.

真嗣走过去，用手抚摸着桌面，想知道他父亲上次来这里是什么时候。他绕到桌子后面坐下，环顾桌上的物品。除了一个看起来像倒三角形和多只眼睛的图画纸外，桌上异常干净。真嗣短暂地考虑过把它放进口袋，但最终决定不这么做。

Setting it back on the table, he tried opening drawers. Most of them were locked except for one that opened. In it was a single photo of a man and a woman. Shinji gazed at this photo for some time until he turned it around and read what was on the back.

把它放回桌上后，他尝试打开抽屉。大部分都上了锁，除了一个能打开的。里面只有一张男女合照。真嗣凝视着这张照片许久，直到他翻过来，读了背面的文字。

"Gendo and Yui," Shinji read aloud.

“源堂和唯，”真嗣大声念道。

Shinji decided to pocket it.

真嗣决定把它放进口袋。

Moments later, he left his fathers office and found Asuka sitting down with her head slumped sideways slightly. Shinji didn't think he spent that much time in there, but it seemed Asuka had fallen asleep during that time. Nudging her gently, she slowly woke up.

片刻后，他离开了父亲的办公室，发现明日香正坐着，头微微歪向一边。真嗣不认为自己在里面待了那么久，但似乎明日香在那段时间里睡着了。他轻轻地推了推她，她慢慢地醒了过来。

"I've seen all I wanted," said Shinji.

“我已经看够了，”真嗣说道。

Rubbing her eyes slowly, Asuka replied, "Okay."

揉着眼睛慢慢醒来，明日香回答道：“好吧。”

Standing up, she yawned widely and flicked the lighter on, and started leading them back down through the headquarters of Nerv.

她站起身，大大地打了个哈欠，点燃打火机，开始带领他们穿过 NERV 总部返回。

As they reached the floor of the Evangelions chamber however, Asuka decided to make a detour.

然而，当他们到达 EVA 机库的楼层时，明日香决定绕个弯。

"Shinji, I think I have one last place I want to stop."

"真嗣，我想还有一个地方我必须去。"

"Okay...what is it?" "好的……是什么地方？"

"Something...thats rather hard to explain I guess. But it goes hand in hand with my Evangelion I guess. So, I think its best if I go there as well.

"那地方……挺难解释的。不过，它和我驾驶的 EVA 有些关联。所以，我觉得我也应该去那里看看。"

"Fine with me," said Shinji with a shrug.

"我没意见。" 真嗣耸了耸肩说。

"Okay, and its not far from here either," said Asuka.

“好的，而且离这儿也不远，”明日香说道。

Leading them passed the door for the Evangelion chamber which wouldn't open, Asuka led them down several more hallways until they reached something which Shinji didn't expect.

带领他们经过无法开启的 EVA 驾驶舱门，明日香又领着他们穿过几条走廊，直到他们来到一个让真嗣意想不到的地方。

"What is this Asuka?" he asked.

“这是什么，明日香？”他问道。

"Where pilots would change into there plug suits of course," said Asuka as if this was fact.

“当然是飞行员换上他们的紧身衣的地方。”明日香如是说，仿佛这是常识。

Shinji could only see a male and female sign hanging above the door which had made him instantly think of a bathroom.

真嗣只能看到门上方挂着的男女性别标志，这让他立刻联想到了洗手间。

Walking into the changing room felt strange, almost as though Shinji was intruding somehow. Asuka with him of course, but he was still remembering that other pilot. Rei was her name he thought Asuka had told him. Though there were many lockers, the only ones that had name tags on them were Asuka's and Rei's.

走进更衣室感觉很奇怪，仿佛真嗣在某种程度上是在侵犯别人的隐私。当然，明日香和他在一起，但他仍然记得那位其他驾驶员。他记得明日香告诉过他，她的名字是绫波。虽然有很多储物柜，但只有明日香和绫波的柜子上贴着名牌。

Shinji watched Asuka as she opened her own locker and looked through at the contents. There wasn't much in there. A few papers for something and three plug suits, all the same that hung in a line.

真嗣看着明日香打开自己的储物柜，查看里面的物品。里面东西不多。几张文件和三件插入栓服，全都一样，整齐地挂成一排。

"So you do like red," said Shinji, trying to make conversation.

“看来你确实喜欢红色。”真嗣试图找话题说道。

Either Asuka didn't hear him or she completely ignored him. She seemed to be gathering herself for something. A mirror hung on the inside door of the locker and Asuka examined her reflection briefly and even seemed to be laughing at it. Shinji knew that he couldn't look much better himself.

要么是明日香没听到他的话，要么就是她完全无视了他。她似乎在为某事做准备。储物柜内侧门上挂着一面镜子，明日香短暂地审视了一下自己的倒影，甚至似乎对着它笑了起来。真嗣知道自己的样子也好不到哪儿去。

Slowly though, Asuka let out a sigh and brought her hand up to her head before she removed the A10 nerve receptors that adorned her hair. The things that she had told Shinji played a significant role in her life, as they signified her position in Nerv, something that she prized above all else. Now though, they were useless in this After Impact world. She slowly placed them in the spot above the plug suits in her locker and then closed if for the final time. Turning around, she started walking away, not looking at Shinji. But he wasn't sure that he could agree with this. Shinji had spoken against them at one point, but that was more because he couldn't understand why she cared about being an Evangelion pilot so much.

然而，明日香缓缓叹了口气，抬起手摸向自己的头，然后取下了装饰在头发上的 A10 神经接收器。这些她曾告诉过真嗣的东西，在她的生活中扮演着重要角色，象征着她在 NERV 中的地位，这是她最为珍视的东西。但现在，在这个后冲击的世界里，它们已经毫无用处。她慢慢地将它们放在储物柜中插槽服上方的位置，然后最后一次关上了柜门。转过身，她开始离开，没有看真嗣一眼。但他不确定自己是否能同意这一点。真嗣曾一度反对过这些，但那更多是因为他不明白她为何如此在意成为 EVA 驾驶员。

"Asuka...is this okay?" "明日香...这样可以吗？"

"...It is," she replied. She didn't seem to want to show any frailty.

"...可以，"她回答道。她似乎不想表现出任何脆弱。"

"Okay," said Shinji, not sure if this was the right thing to say. If he argued enough, she may take them back, but she may get angry at him as well for not siding with her. Either way, Shinji didn't know what he was supposed to say.

“好吧，”真嗣说道，不确定这是否是正确的话。如果他争论得足够多，她可能会收回它们，但她也可能会因为他没有站在她这边而对他生气。无论哪种情况，真嗣都不知道他应该说什么。

Instead he followed her quietly out of the changing room as they began there journey to leave Nerv behind.

相反，他静静地跟着她走出了更衣室，他们开始踏上离开 NERV 的旅程。

They hadn't realized how much time they had spent walking the hallways of Nerv, because as they got out, they realized that the sun was just beginning to set. Seeing this, Shinji suggested that they sleep in the Geofront tonight, as it beat sleeping on asphalt above the surface. Asuka agreed, though rather halfheartedly.

他们没有意识到他们在 NERV 的走廊里走了多久，因为当他们出来时，他们意识到太阳刚刚开始落山。看到这一幕，真嗣建议他们今晚在 Geofront 过夜，因为这比睡在地面上的柏油路上要好。明日香同意了，尽管有些不情愿。

They set up camp next to the lake, and Shinji made do with what rations they had left. He'd probably have to find more on there way back tomorrow. But again, back to what? In all honesty, there really wasn't much left for them back at that old store they had frequented after the rainstorm. They may as well stay here in the Geofront, but Shinji had a feeling Asuka couldn't agree to that. He himself was having a difficult time being here when he thought about the bloodshed that occurred. The thought of that vision surfaced in his mind, but he pushed it to the side again. Even though he had wanted to see his fathers office, it was eerier then he had imagined.

他们在湖边扎营，而真嗣只能将就着用剩下的口粮。明天返回的路上，他大概还得找些补给。但话说回来，回到哪里呢？老实说，那场暴雨后他们常去的老店，剩下的东西真的不多了。他们还不如就留在这地底都市，但真嗣觉得明日香不会同意。一想到这里曾发生过的血腥事件，他自己也难以安心。那个幻象再次浮现在脑海，但他又一次将其推开。尽管他曾想看看父亲的办公室，但那地方比想象中还要阴森。

Setting the sleeping bags next to the fire that Shinji had managed to start with fallen branches around the edges of the forest, Shinji lay down on his own and let his mind wander. What he had seen today was a surprise and he thought about everything that Asuka had told him over the course of the two months or so they had spent together. It was a lot to take it. Everything thing that he had known prior to meeting her was almost completely thrown out to take place by this new world, a world that he may have lived in himself if things hadn't happened the way they had. What would have happened to him then? He would have worked with Asuka and that other pilot, Rei, and they would have fought the angels together. Was it better than what he had before? He didn't know the answer to that, but at least he would have had a purpose at least.

将睡袋安置在真嗣好不容易用森林边缘的枯枝点燃的篝火旁，真嗣躺下，任思绪飘荡。今天所见的一切令他意外，他回想起与明日香这两个月来共度的时光，她告诉他的种种。这一切让他难以消化。遇见她之前他所知的一切几乎都被这个新世界所取代，一个若非命运如此，他本可能身处其中的世界。那么，他会怎样呢？他会与明日香和另一位驾驶员绫波丽并肩作战，共同对抗使徒。这比他之前的生活更好吗？他无从知晓答案，但至少，他会有一个目标。

Sitting up, he looked across the fire to where Asuka's sleeping bag was, but saw that she wasn't sitting at it. Instead, she was several feet away, sitting at the edge of the lake. Standing up, he walked over to where she was.

坐起身来，他望向篝火对面阿斯哈的睡袋处，却发现她并未坐在那里。相反，她离了几英尺远，坐在湖边。他站起身，朝她所在的地方走去。

"Whats up?" he asked in what he hoped was an innocent voice.

"怎么了？" 他用自认为无辜的语气问道。

"Just thinking about stuff," replied Asuka.

"只是在想些事情，" 明日香回答道。

Shinji sat down next to her and looked at the lake as well. The last rays of the sun were casting a warm glow on the lake, turning the already orange color even darker.

真嗣在她旁边坐下，也望向湖面。夕阳的最后一抹余晖在湖面上投下温暖的辉光，使得原本橙色的湖水显得更加深沉。

"We aren't going to stay here, are we?" asked Asuka suddenly.

“我们不会留在这里，对吧？”明日香突然问道。

"No, I don't think so," said Shinji. "I don't think either of us want to stay here."

“不，我不这么认为，”真嗣说，“我想我们俩都不想留在这儿。”

"Did you find anything in your fathers office?" asked Asuka.

“你在你父亲的办公室里找到什么了吗？”明日香问道。

"Yeah," said Shinji. “嗯，”真嗣说。

Digging into his pocket, he pulled out the photo that he had of his mother and father, one of the only pictures he had ever seen of his mother.

他伸手从口袋里掏出那张父母的照片，这是他仅有的几张母亲的照片之一。

"Is that your mother and father when they were young."

"那是你年轻时的父母吗？"

"Yeah, I think so." "嗯，我想是的。"

"Your mother is beautiful," said Asuka.

"你妈妈真漂亮，"明日香说。"

Shinji wasn't sure how he supposed to reply to that, so he didn't.

真嗣不确定该如何回应，所以他保持沉默。

"Where will we go after this?" thought Asuka out loud.

“之后我们去哪儿？”明日香大声地自言自语。

"Not sure," said Shinji. “不确定，”真嗣说。

They sat like that for several minutes, until Asuka stood up and turned to Shinji.

他们就这样坐了几分钟，直到明日香站起来转向真嗣。

"Turn around for a bit Shinji."

“转过去一会儿，真嗣。”

"How come?" “怎么会？”

"I really don't want to go through this again," sighed Asuka.

"我真的不想再经历一次了," 明日香叹息道。

Shinji looked at her for several seconds before Asuka snapped, "Alright fine, I'm gonna swim, so just turn around and look the other way."

真嗣看了她几秒钟，明日香突然说道："好吧好吧，我要去游泳了，你转过身去别看。"

"Isn't it a little cold out for that?" asked Shinji slightly bemused.

"外面这么冷，不太适合游泳吧？" 真嗣略带困惑地问。

"After looking at my reflection, I feel disgusting," retorted Asuka who seemed to be losing her patience.

"看着自己的倒影，我觉得恶心。" 明日香似乎失去了耐心，反驳道。

"If your just going to be swimming, do I really need to turn around?"

"如果你只是去游泳，我真的需要转过身吗？"

Asuka almost laughed. 明日香差点笑出声来。

"Do you want to see me naked that badly?"

"你就那么想看我裸体吗？"

Though it was just teasing, Asuka set a little more than she had intended. This was when Shinji surmised that Asuka wasn't wearing any underwear. When he looked back though, her reactions to certain things made sense. And she had mentioned that the plug suit was a full bodysuit.

虽然这只是开玩笑，但明日香的话比她原本打算的要多一些。这让真嗣推测出明日香没穿内衣。当他回头再看时，她对某些事情的反应变得合理了。而且她之前提到过，插入栓服是全身连体的。

Asuka, now who's face was turning a dull shade of pink, looked as though she would force Shinji to turn around if didn't comply, when Shinji finally obeyed her.

明日香的脸此刻正泛起一层淡淡的粉红，她看起来似乎会强迫真嗣转过身去，直到真嗣最终顺从了她。

'You could have said something earlier if you were uncomfortable,' thought Shinji. He'd have to remember to mention the department store he had gotten there clothes at when they left the Geofront.

'如果你感到不舒服，本可以早点说出来的，' 真嗣心想。他得记住在他们离开地底都市后，提到那家他们买衣服的百货商店。

"And if you turn around to look-" started Asuka.

"如果你转身去看——" 明日香开口道。

"I've heard this enough to know what you'll already say, so just hurry up and swim."

"我已经听过太多遍，知道你会说什么，所以快点游吧。"

Shinji could almost feel Asuka's eyes boring into his back, but instead, he started hearing the shuffling of clothes as she removed them.

真嗣几乎能感觉到明日香目光如炬，直射他的后背，然而，他听到的却是衣物摩擦的声音，她正在脱下它们。

They had both brought their sweatshirts, so Asuka pulled this off first and then removed her shirt, watching Shinji as she did this. She didn't honestly expect him to turn around, but she figured it was better to be safe.

两人都带了运动衫，所以明日香先脱下运动衫，然后是衬衫，一边做着这些一边注视着真嗣。她并不真的指望他会转过身来，但她觉得还是谨慎为妙。

After removing her pants, she waded slowly into the watery LCL fluid, shivering as it touched her body. Though she had told Shinji she wanted to swim, she really just wanted to cleanse herself. LCL fluid wasn't the best for this, but it did the job at least. She washed her hair as best she could without shampoo, and then floated there for a while, letting the water lap at the side of her body. As she looked up, she saw the giant hole in the Geofront. Everything had happened so suddenly that she wasn't sure what to think anymore. One minute she was an Evangelion pilot, and the next second, she was nobody. It was rather depressing, but she had made her decision when she had left the A10 nerve receptors behind.

脱掉裤子后，她缓缓步入那水状的 LCL 液体中，身体接触到液体时微微颤抖。尽管她告诉真嗣她想游泳，但实际上她只是想清洗自己。LCL 液体并非最佳选择，但至少能完成任务。她尽可能在没有洗发水的情况下洗了头发，然后漂浮了一会儿，任由水轻拍她的身体。抬头望去，她看到了地底都市上的巨大空洞。一切发生得如此突然，她已不确定该如何思考。前一刻她还是一位 EVA 驾驶员，下一秒却成了无名之辈。这颇为令人沮丧，但当她留下 A10 神经接点时，她已经做出了决定。

Rolling over in the LCL fluid, she dove downwards, kicking against the water, as she swam forward before surfacing again. It was rather refreshing to be doing this.

在 LCL 溶液中翻滚着，她向下潜去，踢打着水流，向前游动，随后再次浮出水面。这种感觉颇为提神。

After several more minutes of this, she swam back to the shore. She had completely forgotten about Shinji during her time in the water, but he didn't seem to have moved much. He had only gotten closer to the fire, which was okay in her mind.

又过了几分钟，她游回了岸边。在水中的这段时间里，她完全忘记了真嗣的存在，但他似乎也没怎么动。他只是更靠近了火堆，这在她看来没什么问题。

As Shinji heard her footsteps leaving the water, he asked, "Are you done yet?"

当真嗣听到她的脚步声离开水面时，他问道："你游完了吗？"

"With swimming, yes. With changing, no. So stay turned around."

"游泳是结束了，换衣服还没。所以你继续背过身去。"

'Demanding today, aren't we,' thought Shinji, but he continued to stay turned around.

'今天要求真多啊，' 真嗣心想，但他继续保持背对着。

After much shuffling of clothes, Asuka finally gave him the go ahead to turn around. She had her pant legs rolled up almost to her knees, and she was trying to dry her hair out by using her sweatshirt as a towel. She then ran her hand through her hair to straighten it out as best she could. The shirt she was wearing however could be easily seen that darker spots were forming where the water was dripping. Shinji thought he even saw something else, but he tried to forget about this.

在衣服一阵窸窣声后，明日香终于示意他可以转身了。她的裤腿卷起到快接近膝盖，正试图用运动衫当毛巾来擦干头发。随后，她用手梳理头发，尽量把它弄直。然而，她穿的那件衬衫上可以明显看到水滴留下的深色痕迹。真嗣觉得他甚至看到了别的东西，但他努力不去想这些。

"You look different," he suddenly said.

“你看起来不一样了，”他突然说道。

Asuka paused as she was drying her hair and asked, "Oh? In what way?"

明日香一边擦着头发一边停了下来，问道：“哦？怎么个不同法？”

"Not really sure," said Shinji honestly. "Your hair seems a little longer I guess, but other than that..."

“不太确定，”真嗣老实回答，“你的头发好像稍微长了一点吧，除此之外……”

"The nerve receptors held my hair up a little, so thats maybe why. It is getting a little long though," she said a she held a strand of her hair in front of her face.

"“神经感受器把我的头发稍微撑起来了，所以可能是这个原因。不过确实有点长了，”她说着，将一缕头发摆到脸前。”

"Looks fine to me," said Shinji offhandedly.

"看起来不错啊," 真嗣随口说道。

"Oh?" mumbled Asuka. She didn't say anything other than that however.

"哦？" 明日香咕哝了一声。但她没有再说别的。

Moving out of her way, Shinji walked around the other side of the fire to his sleeping bag and sat down. Asuka did the same across from him.

真嗣从她身边走开，绕到火堆的另一边，坐在自己的睡袋旁。明日香也在他对面坐下。

"How do you feel?" asked Shinji

"你感觉怎么样？" 真嗣问道

"After swimming. A lot better."

"游完泳后，感觉好多了。"

"I didn't mean that...you said before that those things you wore in your head meant a lot to you, more then I could understand. Why did you leave them behind?"

“我不是那个意思……你之前说过，你头上戴的那些东西对你意义重大，远超我能理解的程度。为什么你要把它们留下？”

"It was time for me to move on." said Asuka after a short pause.

"是时候该我继续前进了。" 明日香短暂停顿后说道。

"Is that okay though?" "这样真的好吗？"

"You already asked me that Shinji, and I told you, its fine. The past is just that, the past. Everything before now doesn't matter. Whatever I was before now, it doesn't matter."

"你已经问过我这个问题了，真嗣，我告诉过你，没问题的。过去就是过去，现在之前的一切都不重要。无论我以前是什么样，现在都不重要了。"

"Yes it does," said Shinji rather adamantly. "It does matter, because it is still a part of your life, even if that life is in the past. While I don't have a problem with you leaving those A10 things at Nerv, I don't think you should completely forget about your past at Nerv. Everybody that you met at Nerv, they were important people."

"是的，确实如此，" 真嗣相当坚定地说道，"这很重要，因为即便那段生活已成为过去，它依然是构成你生命的一部分。虽然我不介意你把那些 A10 的东西留在 NERV，但我认为你不应该完全忘记在 NERV 的过去。你在 NERV 遇到的每一个人，他们都是重要的人。

"And you're one to lecture me about ignoring my past?"

"你倒是教训起我来了，自己不也忽视了过去吗？"

"I'm not a good example, true, but its not just that. Its too sad to see you ignore everything about your prior life. Now is the most important certainly, but don't throw everything away before now either, because thats what has made you who you are in the present."

“我确实不是个好榜样，但这不只是重点。看到你完全忽视过去的一切，实在太令人难过了。当然，现在是最重要的，但也不要把之前的全部抛弃，因为正是那些过往造就了现在的你。”

Shinji calmly finished, leaving Asuka rather silent. He hoped that she wouldn't see his worry as pity, but as something more caring. He cared about her, and maybe that was partially for himself, but he still did.

碇真嗣平静地说完，让明日香陷入了沉默。他希望她不会将自己的担忧视为怜悯，而是看作一种更深切的关怀。他关心她，也许这其中也有一部分是为了自己，但他确实如此。

"You say to much," said Asuka eventually.

"你说的太多了，" 明日香最终说道。

"Asuka-" started Shinji. "明日香——" 真嗣开口道。

"No...forget it Shinji. I've heard enough for one day."

"不……算了，真嗣。我今天听得够多了。"

After that, Asuka turned around, facing away from him and tried to fall asleep.

之后，明日香转过身去，背对着他，试图入睡。

'She just doesn't want to face the truth,' thought Shinji as he looked at her back. Though as she had said, he wasn't one to talk.

'她只是不想面对现实，'真嗣看着她的背影心想。尽管正如她所说，他也没资格说别人。

Laying down, Shinji tried to force himself to fall asleep, but it was a long while before he finally managed. Meanwhile, across the fire from him, Asuka was having an equally hard time. Shinji spoke more of the truth than what Asuka had wanted to acknowledge herself. She couldn't fault him for that, as she knew by now that he usually spoke whatever was on his mind.

躺下后，真嗣努力让自己入睡，但过了很久才终于成功。与此同时，在火堆对面的明日香也同样难以入眠。真嗣说出的真相比明日香愿意承认的更多。她不能因此责怪他，因为她现在知道他通常是想到什么就说什么。

A lot had changed for Asuka since she had woken up with a stranger sitting next to her. Though she had to admit, she wasn't sure where she'd be if not for Shinji. The thought of that puzzled her for a brief instance, but she ignored it for now. The last thing she needed was for Shinji to hear her say something like that.

自从醒来发现一个陌生人坐在旁边后，明日香的生活发生了许多变化。尽管她不得不承认，如果不是因为真嗣，她不确定自己会在哪里。这个念头让她短暂地困惑了一下，但她现在选择忽略它。她最不需要的就是让真嗣听到她说这样的话。

Rolling into a more comfortable position, Asuka fell asleep dreaming that she was back inside the comfort of Evangelion Unit 02, but for some reason Unit 01 was there with her.

明日香翻了个身，找到一个更舒适的姿势，然后睡着了，梦见自己回到了二号机的舒适怀抱中，但不知为何，初号机也在那里与她同在。

So I had a lot of fun working on this chapter, largely because we get to see Nerv again, though in very minuscule detail. And of course Shinji's visions are starting to come back again, so expect more with that in the future.

所以我在做这个chapter时玩得很开心，主要是因为我们又能看到 Nerv 了，尽管只是非常细微的细节。当然，真嗣的幻觉又开始回来了，所以未来这方面会有更多内容。

On another note, the birthday themed story that I mentioned during the previous chapter, the first chapter for that will be coming out on the first of march (so friday, I got a lot of work ahead of me) and go all the way to the tenth. It will be mature and expect chapters daily. Tentative story title is Birthday Without Surprises, though that could still possibly change.

另外，之前在chapter中提到的生日主题故事，第一个chapter将在 3 月 1 日（也就是周五，我还有很多工作要做）发布，一直持续到 10 号。这将是一部成熟的作品，预计每天更新一章。暂定故事标题为《没有惊喜的生日》，不过这个标题仍有可能变动。

### Chapter 25: Attachment 第二十五章：依恋  

It was now summer, around mid July, and though the memories of that day in early March would always remain within Shinji's mind, time had passed since then. In reality, Shinji and Asuka had begun to lose any semblance of dates, and though it had steadily gotten warmer out, heralding the arrival of summer, neither knew what month they were in anymore. They still had the calendar, but had since forgotten about it, and neither paid it any attention. Instead, they focused on changes within themselves, and their outward exterior. Shinji was taller now, and though he had always been slightly taller than Asuka, it was more pronounced now. His hair was longer as well, and was a shaggy mop on his head that covered his forehead entirely, threatening to spill into his eyes. He had matured since that time, and though he didn't feel much older, if two pictures were placed side by side of him then, and now, the differences would have been striking.  
如今已是盛夏，大约七月中旬，尽管三月初那一天的记忆永远铭刻在真嗣心中，但时间已经流逝。实际上，真嗣和明日香已经开始逐渐忘记日期，尽管天气逐渐变暖，预示着夏天的到来，但他们已经不知道现在是几月份了。他们仍然有日历，但早已忘记它的存在，也都不再关注。相反，他们专注于自身的变化和外在表现。真嗣现在更高了，尽管他一直比明日香稍高一些，但现在这种差异更加明显。他的头发也更长了，像一团蓬乱的草丛覆盖着他的额头，几乎要遮住眼睛。自从那时起，他成熟了许多，尽管他并不觉得自己老了很多，但如果将他那时和现在的照片并排放置，差异会非常显著。

Asuka on the other hand had begun to develop her more womanly features to such an extent that Shinji felt wrong staring at her body sometimes. Her body was more curved, her breasts fuller, and her hips in particular looked as though they had been carved by some sculptor. Just seeing her body swaying in rhythm as she walked was enough for Shinji to want to embrace her. At one point, at the beginning of April, Asuka had trimmed her hair slightly, but it was now back to a long length, reaching almost to her waist. Asuka had matured as well, and though she still enjoyed teasing Shinji occasionally, she was no longer embarrassed about showing her affection towards him. This was something that had both happened to them really.  
另一方面，明日香的女性特质开始愈发明显，以至于有时真嗣盯着她的身体看都会感到不妥。她的身形更加曲线玲珑，胸部丰满，尤其是她的臀部，仿佛出自某位雕塑家之手。仅仅是看着她走路时身体摇曳的节奏，就足以让真嗣想要拥她入怀。四月初，明日香曾稍稍修剪过头发，但如今又恢复了长发，几乎垂至腰际。明日香也成熟了许多，虽然她偶尔还会捉弄真嗣，但已不再羞于表达对他的情感。这一切，确实在他们之间悄然发生。

Since it was summer, and the days were becoming considerably hotter, the need to keep the fireplace going most of the day was not as dire as it once was, but sometimes at night, they liked to start it anyway, especially on the occasions where they dozed on the couch together. With that said, their supply of wood had dwindled again, so Shinji was currently cutting more at the logging site he had created months ago. He had expanded the tree line further and further north until he had hit a large hillside, and then had started working his way west. He figured he may have to relocate eventually, but it was still many months before that, and hopefully they could make it through the winter.  
由于正值夏季，白昼愈发炎热，维持壁炉整日燃烧的需求已不如从前那般迫切，但夜晚时分，他们仍喜欢点燃它，尤其是在一起蜷缩在沙发上打盹的时候。话虽如此，他们的木柴储备再次减少，因此真嗣目前正在他几个月前开辟的伐木场砍伐更多木材。他不断向北扩展林地，直至遇到一座大山坡，随后便开始向西推进。他估计自己迟早需要搬迁，但那至少还有几个月的时间，希望他们能熬过这个冬天。

He was still practicing with his AT-field of course, and right now, now that he was done with the gathering of firewood, he was practicing again. He had steadily continued to develop his ability to control it, but it still wasn't satisfactory to him. He had made significant progress though.  
当然，他仍在练习 AT 力场，现在，完成了收集柴火的任务后，他又开始了练习。他稳步提升了自己控制 AT 力场的能力，但对他来说仍未达到满意水平。不过，他已经取得了显著的进步。

Shinji's feet hit the soft ground, and then he looked up towards the tree high above him. In his hand, he held a branch from the top of the tree which he had just cut off with his AT-field. He had finally succeeded in his attempt which had injured him back in March, and he was rather pleased with himself. It had all been a matter of timing, though his own physical body's growth didn't hurt either.  
真嗣的双脚踏上柔软的土地，随即抬头望向高耸入云的树梢。他手中握着一根刚用 AT 力场切下的树顶枝条。终于，他在三月份受伤的那次尝试成功了，这让他颇为自得。一切都是时机问题，当然，他身体的成长也功不可没。

Throwing the smaller branch into the back of his truck for the hell of it, he jumped into the front seat, and then began the bumpy drive back, weaving around the stumps of old trees which he had previously felled. Asuka would probably be back from the grocery store by now, and he hadn't seen her since the morning, so he was eagerly awaiting to see her cheerful face.  
他随手将较小的树枝扔进卡车后斗，跳进驾驶座，开始了颠簸的回程，穿梭于之前砍倒的树桩之间。明日香大概已经从杂货店回来了，而他从早上起就没见过她，因此他热切期待着看到她那张欢快的脸庞。

---

Parking in the driveway, he stepped out and decided to leave the firewood for later. The chance of it raining was near zero, so he didn't have to worry about that so much. Walking along the side of the house, he opened the sliding glass door. The station wagon was already back, as Shinji expected it to be, so he wasn't surprised to see Asuka working in the kitchen. They had a routine that they had started going through, and both knew roughly the times to expect the other back at the house, and so Asuka was just finishing a small lunch when Shinji returned.  
他把车停在车道上，下车后决定把柴火留到稍后再处理。下雨的可能性几乎为零，所以他不必过于担心。沿着房子的一侧走去，他打开了滑动玻璃门。那辆旅行车已经回来了，正如真嗣所预料的那样，所以他并不惊讶看到明日香在厨房里忙碌。他们有一个已经形成的日常习惯，两人大致知道对方何时会回家，因此当真嗣回来时，明日香正好在准备一份小午餐。

"Ah, good, you're back. I was just about finished," said Asuka as she noticed his presence.  
“啊，太好了，你回来了。我刚要弄完，”明日香注意到他的到来，说道。

Shinji sat at the dining table in the kitchen, and then moments later, Asuka brought out his lunch. Shinji accepted it gratefully, and then received a quick kiss, which he was also grateful, and quite happy for. They had become so used to kissing each other, that it was a normal occurrence in their daily life, but that didn't make it any less sweet. Even now, they would sometimes just start kissing each other, without any worry about which room they were in the house, or even outside. They had once gotten sidetracked while going to the hot springs, and had ended up kissing each other in the car for thirty minutes or so.  
真嗣坐在厨房的餐桌旁，片刻后，明日香端出了他的午餐。真嗣感激地接过，随即得到了一个快速的吻，对此他也同样心怀感激，且颇为欣喜。他们已经习惯了彼此亲吻，这已成为他们日常生活中的常态，但这并未减少它的甜蜜。即便现在，他们有时也会毫无顾忌地开始亲吻对方，不在乎身处家中哪个房间，甚至在外面也是如此。有一次，他们在前往温泉的路上分了心，结果在车里亲吻了大约三十分钟。

They talked while they ate, chatting about anything that came to their minds. Asuka's initial conception about the food in the grocery store was turning out to be wrong, and so they would soon have to start driving further for food. When they realized this, Asuka toyed with the idea of starting her own garden, though this came with a multitude of problems, and she would had to have started back in early spring for it to be affective. Knowing that winter was less than six months away worried them slightly, but they didn't talk about this.  
他们边吃边聊，随意地聊着脑海中浮现的任何话题。明日香最初对杂货店食物的看法似乎是错误的，因此他们很快就需要开车更远的地方去买食物。意识到这一点后，明日香萌生了开辟自己花园的想法，但这伴随着诸多问题，她本应在早春就开始行动才能有效。得知冬天不到六个月就要来临，他们略感担忧，但并未就此展开讨论。

Their daily lives continued in a similar manner to how things had been during the two an a half months spent in their old house in Tokyo-2, but even those times were beginning to fade from their memory. Before long, it would almost be a full year since they had begun living together, waking up on the beach of Tokyo-3 those many months ago. Whatever had happened in the past, was now the past, and so, they continued living without much worry about what the future might hold.  
他们的日常生活依旧与在东京-2 旧居度过的两个半月相似，但即便那些时光也正逐渐从记忆中淡去。不久之后，他们同居生活将满一年，想起数月前在东京-3 海滩上的醒来，过往种种已成过去。无论曾经发生什么，都已成为历史，于是他们继续生活，对未来不甚忧虑。

When Shinji was done eating, Asuka took his plate and washed it, along with her own, and Shinji leaned back in his chair relaxed, looking up at the white ceiling. Shinji wasn't in any hurry to continue developing their relationship, as he felt both were still too young to dive into the things associated with adults, but thats not to say he didn't think about it.  
当真嗣吃完饭后，明日香接过他的盘子，连同自己的一起清洗，而真嗣则靠在椅背上，放松地仰望白色天花板。真嗣并不急于推进他们的关系，他认为两人都还太年轻，不宜涉足成人世界的事物，但这并不意味着他从未思考过。

Whenever he held Asuka, kissed her, felt her body against his, there was always a thought in the back of his mind of 'will something happen?' Both had been careful in this regard, always breaking off physical contact to gather their thoughts instead of becoming lost in the moment. Once or twice, things had come rather close on certain occasions, but reasoning had always won through. Asuka herself seemed to have a rather particular reasoning for abstaining from this, but Shinji didn't know what it was, nor did he ask. She was always rather keen on reminding him on boundaries, and what she'd do if he attempted to cross them. Well, Shinji felt that she herself had to be reminded occasionally of these boundaries as well. Asuka was still very assertive whenever the mood struck her, and Shinji had lost track of how many times her teeth had sunk into his neck.  
每当他拥抱着明日香，亲吻她，感受她的身体紧贴着自己时，脑海中总会浮现一个念头：“会不会发生什么？”两人在这方面都格外小心，总是及时中断肢体接触，以便整理思绪，而非迷失于当下。有几次，情况险些失控，但理智总能占据上风。明日香似乎有她独特的理由克制自己，但真嗣并不知晓，也未曾询问。她总是热衷于提醒他界限所在，以及逾越界限的后果。然而，真嗣觉得她有时也需要被提醒这些界限。明日香的情绪一旦上来，依然会表现得相当强势，真嗣已经记不清有多少次她的牙齿咬进了他的脖颈。

Above all else though, Shinji was still wondering when the words would be spoken between them. Now, there was never a moment where Shinji didn't believe that she felt that way for him, but the words, 'I love you,' coming from her, was something that he sincerely hoped to hear at some point. While he hadn't said these words to her specifically, he had mumbled them a few times besides that night when they first kissed. Once or twice, he had felt like saying them to her while they kissed, but he always held back. He wasn't sure how she'd react in all honesty. Asuka was fine showing her feelings physically now, but speaking them out loud was still difficult for her, as though someone may be eavesdropping on them. This was of course a ridiculous notion.  
然而，最重要的是，真嗣一直在想他们之间何时会说出那句话。现在，真嗣从未怀疑过她对他的感情，但那句“我爱你”从她口中说出来，是他真心希望有朝一日能听到的。虽然他没有直接对她说过这些话，但在他们第一次接吻的那个晚上，他曾含糊地嘟囔过几次。有一两次，他在接吻时觉得应该告诉她，但他总是忍住了。他不确定她会有什么反应，说实话。如今，明日香在肢体上表达感情已经很自然了，但大声说出来对她来说仍然很难，仿佛有人在偷听他们似的。当然，这是一个荒谬的想法。

He thought about these things, leaning back in his chair at the dining table, while the sounds of Asuka working in front of the sink filled his ears. He had hardly seen her at all today, so he wanted to spend as much time with her as possible. Shinji himself had grown more accustomed to displaying his feelings for her, and it was no longer Asuka who always took the first step.  
他靠在餐桌旁的椅子上，思考着这些事情，而明日香在洗碗池前忙碌的声音充斥着他的耳朵。今天他几乎没怎么见到她，所以他想尽可能多地和她在一起。真嗣自己也越来越习惯于向她表达自己的感情，不再是明日香总是主动迈出第一步。

Standing up, Shinji walked silently over to where Asuka was working. She was humming quietly to herself, focused on what she was doing, so she didn't notice him. Erasing his presence entirely, he slowly wrapped his hands around her waist, causing Asuka to jump immensely, splashing the water that she had been using from a gallon jug all over the counter. Asuka had found a small river within the towns limits shortly after they had moved in, and this is how they began washing the dishes every night. But it was still a lot of water to lose all in one go.  
站起身来，真嗣默默地走向正在工作的明日香。她正轻声哼着歌，专注于手头的事情，所以没有注意到他。他完全隐去了自己的存在感，缓缓地用双手环住她的腰，这让明日香猛地一跳，将原本用大水壶倒出的水溅得满台都是。自从他们搬进来后不久，明日香就在城镇的范围内找到了一条小河，从此他们每晚都这样洗碗。但一次性浪费这么多水还是让人心疼。

Darting around to look at Shinji who was directly behind him, Asuka scolded him saying-  
明日香迅速转身看向站在身后的真嗣，责备道——

"Don't do that. I just filled this thing earlier today, and half of it is already gone now thanks to your idiocy."  
“别这样。我今天刚装满这水壶，现在一半都被你的愚蠢行为给浪费了。”

"Can I help it if I haven't seen you at all today?"  
"难道我能控制自己今天一整天都没见到你吗？"

Asuka frowned at him, but turned around, returning to her work with Shinji's arms still wrapped around her waist. She wasn't about to tell him to stop holding her, since she was always pleased whenever he did so, but it was slightly different when she was focusing on something. Shinji had gotten good at concealing himself, and Asuka had her suspicions about this, but never commented on it. He knew what he was doing, and what he felt best, so she left it as it was.  
明日香皱着眉头看着他，但还是转过身去，继续她的工作，而真嗣的手臂依然环抱着她的腰。她并不打算让他停止拥抱，因为她总是很高兴他这样做，但当她专注于某件事时，感觉略有不同。真嗣已经很擅长隐藏自己，明日香对此有所怀疑，但从未提及。他知道自己该做什么，也知道什么最适合自己，所以她任由事情保持原样。

As Asuka continued cleaning the dishes though, Shinji rested his head on her shoulder, causing Asuka to start squirming with his messy hair brushing against her neck. She was constantly trying to have him let her cut it, but he was stubborn about this.  
尽管明日香继续洗着碗，真嗣却把头靠在她的肩上，这让明日香因为他的乱发拂过她的脖子而开始扭动。她一直试图让他同意剪头发，但他对此非常固执。

"Shinji quit it. You're distracting me."  
"真嗣，别闹了。你分散我注意力了。"

Shinji only responded by brushing his lips softly against her neck, making Asuka squirm even further, but washing the dishes was beginning to disappear from her mind.  
真嗣只是轻轻地用嘴唇拂过她的脖子作为回应，这让明日香更加扭动不安，洗碗这件事也渐渐从她脑海中消失。

'Fine, you win,' thought Asuka, as she turned around, and locked lips with him.  
'好吧，你赢了，'明日香想着，转过身去，与他唇齿相依。

Thirty minutes roughly passed when Asuka finally untangled herself from Shinji's arms on the couch. While she always enjoyed these moments, she told him that under no such circumstances was he allowed to enter the kitchen now until she was done.  
大约三十分钟过去，明日香终于从真嗣的怀抱中挣脱出来，坐到了沙发上。尽管她总是享受这些时刻，但她还是告诉他，在任何情况下，他都不允许在她完成之前进入厨房。

Shinji sighed rather heavily, but nodded all the same, deciding to continue reading from his book. He had already gone through the books within the house multiple times, and had since started pillaging nearby houses, looking for anything suitable to read. Asuka was the same, though her taste in books was rather skewed towards romance currently, something she probably never would have read eight months ago. Shinji didn't care as long as the premise was interesting enough, he'd give the book a chance.  
真嗣重重地叹了口气，但还是点了点头，决定继续从他的书上读下去。他已经把家里的书翻了好几遍，于是开始搜刮附近的房子，寻找任何适合阅读的东西。明日香也是如此，尽管她现在的阅读品味偏向于浪漫小说，这可能是她八个月前绝不会读的类型。真嗣不在乎，只要前提足够有趣，他就会给这本书一个机会。

He kept reading, until Asuka was finished, and then sat down on the couch beside him, stretching out so that her legs were resting on his lap. The couch was large enough for three people to sit on it, so this was an easily done feet. Setting his book down beside him, he glanced over at Asuka, seeing that she was watching him. He assumed that it was alright to kiss her again, but Asuka brought something up instead.  
他继续阅读，直到明日香完成，然后坐在他旁边的沙发上，伸展开来，把腿搭在他的腿上。沙发足够大，可以容纳三个人坐下，所以这很容易做到。他把书放在身边，瞥了一眼明日香，发现她在看着他。他以为可以再次吻她，但明日香提出了别的事情。

"Hey Shinji?" “嘿，真嗣？”

"Hmm?" “嗯？”

"We should do something today."  
“我们今天应该做点什么。”

"Oh, like what?" "哦，比如什么？"

"I don't know. I was honestly hoping you had an idea."  
"我不知道。老实说，我本来希望你有个主意。"

"Well, its been a while since we drove to Kyoto. We could always do that."  
"嗯，我们很久没开车去京都了。我们可以再去一次。"

"Rejected." "被拒绝了。"

They occasionally did this, just to break out of the routine, and drove to Kyoto. Initially, they hadn't spent much time in the city back at the end of February and early March, but they had driven there about a dozen times now. The city held so many national heritage sites, that they had been to nearly all of them by now. Most of the roads were now open as well, thanks to Shinji's use of his AT-field. They had even driven far south to Osaka, and spent a night there, but the destruction thanks to Third Impact had left the city in ruins so badly, that seeing the devastation reminded them of the world they now lived in. They hadn't been back since.  
他们偶尔会这样做，只是为了打破常规，于是驱车前往京都。起初，他们在二月底和三月初并没有在京都逗留太久，但现在他们已经去过大约十几次了。京都拥有众多国家遗产，他们几乎已经参观了所有这些地方。多亏了真嗣使用他的 AT 力场，大多数道路现在都已开放。他们甚至驱车南下到大阪，并在那里过了一夜，但第三次冲击造成的破坏使得这座城市满目疮痍，看到这片废墟让他们想起了现在生活的世界。自那以后他们就再也没有回去过。

"Well, if not Kyoto, then what?"  
"好吧，如果不是京都，那还有什么地方呢？"

"I don't know...I'm thinking," mumbled Asuka as she tilted her head up to the ceiling.  
"我不知道...我在想，" 明日香咕哝着，将头仰向天花板。

Shinji watched her, but eventually, Asuka gave up and shrugged her shoulders.  
真嗣看着她，但最终，明日香放弃了，耸了耸肩。

"Well, I'll think of something later I suppose."  
"嗯，我想晚点会有办法的。"

Swinging her legs off Shinji's lap, she crawled across the couch towards him, and then leaned in to kiss him. Shinji met her lips happily, as he slowly sank into the couch with Asuka on top of him. Asuka kissed him softly, drawing out each kiss for as long as possible. The experience they had lacked initially had been completely overturned so that each knew what the other enjoyed. Soon, Asuka was grinning in spite of the situation, enjoying the pleasant feel of Shinji's lips against her own. With every kiss, she felt like she was melting in his arms.  
她从真嗣的腿上晃下双腿，爬过沙发向他靠近，然后倾身吻了他。真嗣欣然迎上她的唇，随着阿斯卡压在他身上，他缓缓陷入沙发中。阿斯卡温柔地吻着他，尽可能延长每一次亲吻。他们最初缺乏的经验已被彻底颠覆，以至于彼此都了解对方的喜好。很快，尽管处境尴尬，阿斯卡还是忍不住笑了起来，享受着真嗣唇间传来的愉悦感觉。每一次亲吻，她都觉得自己在他怀里融化。

'God, how did I end up like this?' wondered Asuka. 'How did I become so desperate for this that all other thoughts are immediately shut off? Why does kissing Shinji feel so perfect, as though it was meant to happen?'  
'天啊，我怎么会变成这样？'阿斯卡心想。'我是如何变得如此渴望这一切，以至于其他念头立刻被屏蔽？为什么吻真嗣感觉如此完美，仿佛这一切都是命中注定？'

Asuka didn't know the answer to these questions. Sure, she was in the midst of puberty, but that only explained half of the situation. If it had been any other guy, Asuka didn't think she would be having these reactions, these excited feelings coursing through her body, as though a gate within her had been opened. She longed to do more, but knew the possible repercussions.  
阿斯卡不知道这些问题的答案。当然，她正处于青春期，但这只能解释一半的情况。如果是其他男孩，阿斯卡不认为自己会有这些反应，这些兴奋的感觉在她体内奔涌，仿佛她内心的一扇门被打开了。她渴望做更多，但知道可能的后果。

Breaking off the kiss, Asuka leaned away from him, but still remained firmly on his waist. She felt a reaction from him, but she ignored it. Shinji was a guy afterall, and she had become used to this, but their was still a certain amount of curiosity mixed up within it all.  
结束亲吻，明日香从他身上微微后仰，但依旧稳稳地坐在他的腰间。她感觉到他的反应，却选择忽视。毕竟，真嗣是个男生，对此她已习以为常，但内心深处仍混杂着一丝好奇。

Before she allowed these thoughts to take hold of her in her hormonal state, she removed herself from Shinji's lap, sitting on the couch cushion beside him. There was much to be said about her feelings for Shinji, but Asuka had difficulties putting it to words. It was just something she felt, and that was it.  
在她被荷尔蒙驱使的思绪占据之前，明日香从真嗣的腿上起身，坐到了他旁边的沙发垫上。关于她对真嗣的感情，有很多话可以说，但明日香难以用言语表达。那是一种她内心深处的感受，仅此而已。

Sitting up, Shinji stretched as though he had just gotten done with a workout, and Asuka had to laugh at that. Glancing over at her, Shinji smirked briefly, but then stood up. He had tarried long enough with the firewood, and decided to get it out of the way.  
坐起身来，真嗣伸了个懒腰，仿佛刚完成了一场锻炼，这让明日香忍不住笑出声。他瞥了她一眼，短暂地笑了笑，然后站起身来。他已经和柴火纠缠太久，决定尽快解决这件事。

---

Shinji had probably chopped more than what was needed, so it took him longer than usual, but when he was done, he walked inside and washed his hands. Asuka, who had been sitting outside on the patio and reading, suddenly came in. She was grinning in a certain way that made Shinji assume she had decided what to do today, and when she spoke, Shinji confirmed that.  
真嗣可能切得比需要的多了些，所以花的时间比平时长，但当他完成后，他走进屋内洗了洗手。明日香一直坐在外面的露台上读书，突然也进来了。她带着某种得意的笑容，让真嗣猜想她已经决定了今天的计划，而当她开口时，真嗣证实了自己的猜测。

"I know what we're doing," exclaimed Asuka.  
“我知道我们要做什么了，”明日香兴奋地宣布。

"...Okay." “……好吧。”

"But I'm not telling you until its ready. So with that said, I need you to vacate the house for a while."  
"但我不打算在它准备好之前告诉你。所以，这么说吧，我需要你暂时离开这房子一会儿。"

"...Huh?" mumbled Shinji.  
""...啊？"" 真嗣嘟囔道。

"It's a surprise is what I'm saying. So I want you gone for a while."  
"我要说的是，这是个惊喜。所以我想让你离开一会儿。"

"...Alright," said Shinji, wondering what sort of idea Asuka had conjured up within her mind.  
"...好吧," 真嗣说道，心中好奇明日香又想出了什么主意。

With that said, Shinji stepped into his truck and then sat there, trying to decide what he wanted to do to pass the time. But Asuka came out, carrying several empty gallon jugs, and the one that had partially spilled earlier.  
说完，真嗣上了他的卡车，坐在那里，试图决定如何打发时间。但明日香走了出来，手里拿着几个空的大水壶，包括之前部分洒出的那个。

"Since you made me spill this earlier, you can at least take the time to fill all these back up. Plus, this also gives you something to do while you're waiting."  
"既然你之前让我洒了这些，你至少可以花点时间把它们都重新装满。而且，这也给你在等待时找点事情做。"

"If you say so," sighed Shinji.  
"既然你这么说，" 真嗣叹了口气。

Frowning, Asuka said, "I do. And take as much time as possible if you can." Kissing him quickly on the cheek, Asuka hurried back inside, closing the sliding glass door with a loud snap that Shinji could hear, but not see.  
皱着眉头，明日香说："我确实这么想。如果可以的话，尽量多花点时间。" 她迅速在他脸颊上亲了一下，匆匆回到屋内，用力关上滑动玻璃门，发出一声响亮的啪嗒声，真嗣能听见，却看不见。

Sighing again, Shinji grumbled briefly before putting the truck in reverse, and backed out of the driveway. It had been a while since he had seen Asuka this excited about something.  
再次叹息，真嗣咕哝了几句，然后将卡车挂入倒档，倒出了车道。他已经很久没见过明日香对某件事这么兴奋了。

Reaching the top of their hill, he turned left, going in the direction of town. In truth, it was usually Asuka who went into town, since she was in charge of getting groceries, even though Shinji was the one usually left with cooking dinner. She had grown so accustomed to his cooking ability, that she preferred that he cook, since she enjoyed it that much. Shinji normally left it up to her to decide whatever he made, so she usually gathered things while at the store which she wanted. Shinji didn't mind this, since it was nice to know how much she appreciated him.  
到达山顶后，他向左转，朝着城镇的方向走去。实际上，通常是明日香进城，因为她负责采购杂货，尽管通常是真嗣留下来做饭。她已经习惯了他的烹饪能力，以至于她更喜欢他来做饭，因为她非常享受。真嗣通常让她决定做什么菜，所以她通常在商店里挑选她想要的东西。真嗣对此并不介意，因为知道她有多么欣赏他，这感觉很好。

Coasting down the first hill to the bluff overlooking the town, he turned onto main street, and then drove down the second hill, reaching the flat land of the town. He passed the turn for the grocery store on his right, and a mix of small Japanese and English restaurants alike, before turning onto the main highway. Turning right would take him towards the highway which would lead to Kyoto, but instead he turned left.  
沿着第一个山坡滑下，俯瞰着城镇的悬崖，他转上主街，然后驶下第二个山坡，到达城镇的平坦地带。他经过右边通往杂货店的转弯，以及一系列日式和英式小餐馆，然后转上主干道。向右转会带他上高速公路，通往京都，但他却向左转了。

He had only been up this way a handful of times, mostly with Asuka, but this was the way to the small river. He snaked his way further in as he drove along the road past growing rows of trees. He soon hit an incline, and the engine of the truck began roaring as the transmission changed gears since Shinji's foot depressed the gas more and more. Reaching the top of the hill, Shinji felt a sense of weightlessness as he looked down to the valley below. He was perched on top of hill and far below him, he could just make out the bridge that would be his destination. Letting his foot off the break, he coasted his way down the hill, coming to a stop beside the bridge.  
他只来过这里几次，大多是和明日香一起，但这条路通往那条小河。他沿着道路继续深入，穿过一排排逐渐增多的树木。不久，道路开始上坡，随着真嗣的脚越来越用力地踩下油门，卡车的引擎开始轰鸣，变速箱也随之换挡。到达山顶时，真嗣感到一阵失重，俯瞰着下方的山谷。他站在山顶，远远地可以看到他的目的地——那座桥。松开刹车，他顺势滑下山坡，最终停在桥边。

Shinji jumped out, grabbing the many gallon jugs as he did. The river flowed underneath the bridge, and there was a small path beside the shoulder that wound its way down to the riverbed below. The river wasn't very large, about twenty five feet across, and didn't have a single point where the water went over Shinji's head.  
真嗣跳下车，抓起几个大水罐。河水在桥下流淌，桥边有一条小径蜿蜒而下，通向河床。这条河并不宽，大约二十五英尺，水深没有一处超过真嗣的头顶。

Walking down the narrow path, Shinji first kicked off his shoes and rolled up his jeans to his knees before stepping into the water. The sun was high in the sky, and it was unbearably hot out, so Shinji rather enjoyed having this opportunity to cool himself. After he had finished filling all of the jugs, he set them to the side and pulled off his shirt, before doing the same with his pants and underwear. Nobody was going to stumble upon him right now, so there was no problem going in naked.  
沿着狭窄的小径走去，真嗣先是踢掉了鞋子，卷起牛仔裤至膝盖，然后踏入水中。阳光高悬，天气热得让人难以忍受，因此真嗣很享受这个能让自己凉快一下的机会。他装满所有水壶后，将它们放在一旁，脱下衬衫，接着同样脱掉了裤子和内裤。此刻无人会偶然发现他，所以赤身裸体也没什么问题。

Wading into the middle of the river so that the water was above his waist, he suddenly dunked his head into the water, and then quickly came up, feeling refreshed. It was nice that they went to the hot springs at least once a week, and sometimes even more, but the coolness of the river in summer was more applicable.  
他涉水到河中央，水位没过腰际，突然将头浸入水中，随即迅速抬起，感到神清气爽。虽然他们至少每周都会去一次温泉，有时甚至更频繁，但夏日里河水的清凉更为适宜。

He swam for a while, wasting away the time just as Asuka had told him, but his thoughts began to drift towards her. There was a constant strain on his self control whenever he kissed Asuka, or interacted with her in any sort of sense which could be deemed sexual. He knew he loved her, and therefore wanted to show that love in every form imaginable, but knew that he couldn't. There was a certain line that they couldn't cross currently, and while they may put one toe over the line occasionally, never did they step over it. Doing so would invoke a whole different reality for them. Shinji wasn't immune to his desires though, and had acted on them once or twice, always to his self loathing afterwards. It may seem natural to most guys that Shinji did this, but to Shinji, his love for Asuka was to a point that it felt wrong masturbating while thinking of her.  
他游了一会儿，正如明日香所吩咐的那样消磨时间，但思绪却不由自主地飘向了她。每当他与明日香接吻，或是以任何可能被视为带有性意味的方式与她互动时，他总感到自我控制的紧绷。他知道自己爱她，因此渴望以各种想象得到的形式表达这份爱，但他明白自己不能。他们之间有一条目前无法逾越的界限，尽管偶尔他们会试探性地越过一点，却从未真正跨过。这样做会为他们带来一个全新的现实。尽管如此，真嗣并非对自己的欲望无动于衷，他曾一两次屈从于它们，事后总是陷入自我厌恶。对大多数男生来说，真嗣这样做或许显得很自然，但对真嗣而言，他对明日香的爱已经到了一个地步，一想到她便自慰，让他觉得这是错误的。

Stopping mid breaststroke, he planted his feet on the smooth rocks under his feet, and slowly walked out of the water. He dressed quickly, and then grabbed the gallon jugs now filled with water. He hadn't spent nearly enough time here, and therefore, would have to find another way to waste time for a few hours more. But he was starting to feel strong desires again, and decided that it was best not to linger here any longer. Something which would take his mind off said person was what he needed right now.  
他突然停下蛙泳，双脚踩在脚下的光滑岩石上，缓缓走出水面。他迅速穿上衣服，然后抓起已经装满水的加仑水壶。他在这里待的时间远远不够，因此，不得不寻找其他方式再消磨几个小时。但他又开始感到强烈的欲望，决定最好不再逗留。他现在需要的是一些能让他不去想那个人的事情。

---

Meanwhile, Asuka was in the middle of her own problems. This wasn't the first time she was forced into a situation where lacking normal food necessitates had given her headaches. She had normally been able to work her way around this, but it didn't seem like she would be able to this time.  
与此同时，明日香正忙于处理自己的问题。这不是她第一次因为缺乏正常的食物需求而头疼。通常她都能设法解决，但这次似乎行不通了。

Asuka complained under her breath as she busied herself around the kitchen. Each counter was laden with plates and dishes, and the grill on the patio outside look as though a heart attack was imminent, if at all possible. There were far too many things happening all at once that Asuka was trying to supervise, that her head felt like exploding...and all over a stupid idea she had had about an hour ago.  
明日香一边在厨房里忙碌，一边低声抱怨。每个台面上都堆满了盘子和餐具，露台外的烤架看起来就像随时可能心脏病发作，如果真有可能的话。太多事情同时发生，明日香试图监督一切，以至于她的头感觉快要爆炸了……这一切都源于一小时前她那愚蠢的想法。

'Why did I force myself into this situation?' wondered Asuka as she opened cupboards left and right. She hadn't felt this rushed since she had cooked Christmas dinner those many months ago, and that was now nothing but a distant memory.  
‘我为什么要把自己逼到这种境地？’明日香一边左右打开橱柜，一边想着。自从几个月前她做圣诞晚餐以来，她从未感到如此匆忙，而那已经成了遥远的记忆。

She had started immediately after Shinji left, and when she had started, she realized just how daunting a task she had ahead of her, that is, if she wanted to follow the norm of things. The question that was posed in her mind shortly after she started was, 'how exactly do I make a picnic with the limited options I have?' For this is what Asuka was trying to create: a dinner that could be considered a picnic, shared between them in the large field behind their house. Quickly, she realized how impossible this was.  
她是在真嗣离开后立即开始的，而当她开始时，她意识到自己面前的是一项多么艰巨的任务，也就是说，如果她想遵循常规的话。她开始后不久，心中就浮现了一个问题：‘我究竟该如何用有限的选项来准备一次野餐？’这就是明日香试图创造的：一顿可以被视为野餐的晚餐，在他们家后面的大草地上与他们共享。很快，她意识到这有多么不可能。

Her thoughts went first to a typical Japanese bento, but besides the rice, there wasn't much that could be used. Next came an American picnic, but that was even less useful, since she had no way of making sandwiches, and even if she had bread, cheese, meats, and vegetables were impossible to come by. With all this assumed, she created something of a frankenstein picnic, but had hit a road block. How was she supposed to keep everything warm during the hike down to the field? It would have been easy just to forgo the whole concept, but Asuka was far too stubborn for this. The most obvious means was just to have everything be eaten cold, but with most things being canned goods that required heating up to eat, this was difficult. Asuka had done her best, but still wasn't satisfied with the current results.  
她的思绪首先飘向了典型的日式便当，但除了米饭，可用之物并不多。接着她想到了美式野餐，但那更不切实际，因为她无法制作三明治，即便有面包，奶酪、肉类和蔬菜也无处寻觅。在这样的假设下，她拼凑出一种怪异的野餐组合，却遇到了难题：如何在徒步前往田野的过程中保持食物温热？放弃整个想法本是最简单的选择，但明日香太过固执，不愿就此罢休。最显而易见的方法是让所有食物冷食，但大多数罐头食品需要加热才能食用，这让她感到棘手。明日香已尽全力，却仍对当前的结果感到不满。

She didn't know what she was aiming for, and hardly understood her reasoning behind what she was doing, but she knew that it was ultimately for Shinji. Maybe she felt that things had stagnated between them lately. While they still kissed, and plenty at that, gone was the initial excitement and thrill that they had first experienced. Asuka was still very happy every time they kissed, but she wanted more. Lately, that was all that she had been feeling. Kissing wasn't enough, touching wasn't enough, she always wanted more. She still understood the boundaries, but she was always wishing that they weren't there, even though she had practically set them there herself. How many times had Asuka stopped herself while they were in bed together, when everything felt so strong? She had lost track by now.  
她不知道自己究竟在追求什么，几乎不明白自己行为的理由，但她知道这一切归根结底是为了真嗣。或许她感觉到最近两人之间的关系陷入了停滞。尽管他们依然接吻，而且次数不少，但最初的兴奋与激情已不复存在。每次接吻，明日香仍然感到非常幸福，但她渴望更多。近来，这种感觉愈发强烈。仅仅是亲吻和触摸已无法满足她，她总是想要更多。她依然明白界限所在，却总是希望那些界限不存在，尽管实际上正是她自己设定了这些界限。有多少次，当他们同床共枕，情感强烈到难以自持时，明日香阻止了自己？她已经记不清了。

Pausing in the middle of what she was doing, Asuka glanced around the house. It felt significantly more empty without Shinji there, something which Asuka was always reminded of whenever he left for a few hours. She was beginning to wish she hadn't asked him to leave, but that would also spoil so much. She wanted this to be unique, though in all honesty, she wasn't sure how well this would play out.  
停下手中的活计，明日香环顾了一下房子。没有了真嗣在，这里显得空荡荡的，每当他离开几个小时，明日香总会意识到这一点。她开始后悔让他离开，但这也会破坏很多东西。她希望这是特别的，尽管说实话，她不确定这会如何发展。

---

Shinji didn't know how much time had passed since he had left the river: it had been several more hours certainly. He didn't have much thought in what direction he drove, though he had ended up driving closer to Kyoto. It wasn't long before he arrived at the highway that would take him to Kyoto if he so chose, but he continued driving over the bridge. He hadn't actually been out this way before, but decided to now.  
真嗣不知道自己离开河边已经多久了：肯定又过了好几个小时。他开车时并没有多想方向，结果却越来越靠近京都。不久后，他就来到了通往京都的高速公路入口，如果他愿意的话，但他继续驾车过桥。他以前从未走过这条路，但现在决定试试。

He drove by farmland for a while, just as what was on the opposite side, towards their house, but he soon came upon a large town, part of the larger Kyoto metropolitan area. Complete with its own police station, fire station, and K-12 schools, it was a much larger town then Shinji had expected. As with most towns around Kyoto, it also had plenty of shrines dedicated mainly to buddhist teachings. Shinji didn't have any religious beliefs, but even he felt like stepping out and praying to a shrine briefly. If nothing more, it may help his mind calm itself for a bit.  
他驾车经过一片农田，与对面通往他们家的景象相似，但不久便来到了一个较大的城镇，属于京都市更大的都会区的一部分。这里不仅有警察局、消防站和 K-12 学校，规模远超真嗣的预期。与京都周边大多数城镇一样，这里也有许多主要供奉佛教教义的神社。真嗣并无宗教信仰，但即便如此，他仍感到一种下车短暂参拜神社的冲动。即便没有其他目的，这或许能让他心境稍稍平静片刻。

After driving around for a while, he got out, and decided to walk around, just to kill time. It was always a strange feeling whenever he walked on streets now. Was it even possible to consider this public anymore? Was it still public if you were outside your house, even though nobody else was around for several miles in all directions? Tall buildings and concrete streets surrounded him, with the odd car parked on the side here and there. Shinji passed restaurants, shopping malls, grocery stores, movie theaters, many office buildings, and even a municipal building which he suspected to be the town hall.  
驾车兜了一会儿风后，他下了车，决定四处走走以消磨时间。如今每次走在街上，总有一种奇异的感觉。这里还能算是公共场所吗？如果你身处户外，尽管方圆数英里内空无一人，这还算得上是公共场所吗？高耸的建筑物和混凝土街道环绕着他，偶尔可见路边停放的车辆。真嗣经过餐馆、购物中心、杂货店、电影院、众多办公楼，甚至还有一座他猜测是市政厅的市政大楼。

After walking around for a while though, he started growing bored. He wasn't sure how much time had passed since he had left Asuka at home, but either way, he didn't feel like staying out any longer.  
然而，转悠了一会儿后，他开始感到无聊。他不记得自己离开在家等他的明日香已经多久了，但无论如何，他不想再在外面逗留了。

Taking a different route back to his truck, he rounded a corner, and stopped as he saw two rather large office buildings side by side. Though it hadn't even been a day since he had perfected the ability, Shinji was still curious about this. The practicality made it more feasible to be used in situations more similar to this, so while he was here, he may as was well try it. The tree was afterall only about five stories tall.  
他换了一条路线返回卡车，转过一个拐角，突然停下脚步，因为他看到了两座并排的巨大办公楼。尽管他才刚刚掌握这项能力不到一天，但真嗣对此仍充满好奇。在类似这种情境下，其实用性使得它更加可行，所以既然他在这里，不妨试试看。毕竟那棵树也只有五层楼高。

Finding a suitable spot, Shinji tested the ground under his feet, before placing strength into his legs, and then lifted himself off the ground. He shot immediately upward between the two office buildings. They seemed to be part of the same complex, and both were about the same height, though near the top, the paneled glass exterior slanted at an angle similar to a triangle, before dropping straight down. Shinji repeatedly used his AT-field as a spring board whenever his momentum dropped. He knew how to time it perfectly now, and knew just how long the projection would take. This was still easy though, so Shinji decided to create a few variables in his mind.  
找到一个合适的地点后，真嗣先试了试脚下的地面，然后将力量注入双腿，随即一跃而起。他瞬间冲向两座办公楼之间的空中。这两座楼似乎属于同一建筑群，高度也相近，但在接近顶部时，镶嵌玻璃的外墙以类似三角形的斜度倾斜，然后垂直下落。每当势头减弱时，真嗣便反复利用 AT 力场作为弹跳板。他现在已经能完美掌握时机，也清楚投影所需的时间。尽管这仍然很简单，但真嗣决定在脑海中加入一些变量。

Imagining what he would, he started jumping around within the open space as he continued rising. He created platforms faster and faster as his momentum changed, and his bodies position changed. Twisting his body in the air, so that he was he was looking down at the ground, he quickly created a platform and pushed his legs off against it. He immediately flew towards the other building, his body almost crashing into the window pane before he spun in the air again, and created another platform to jump off of.  
想象着自己将要做什么，他开始在开阔的空间内不断跳跃上升。随着动量的变化和身体位置的改变，他创造平台越来越快。在空中扭转身体，以便俯视地面，他迅速创造出一个平台并用双腿蹬离。他立刻飞向另一座建筑，身体几乎要撞上窗玻璃，但在空中再次旋转，创造出另一个平台跳离。

Shinji continued doing this until he reached the top of the triangular slope. There was a small gap at the edge that allowed Shinji to sit, almost perched on the edge and look down at the city below. He was a little more than twenty stories up now, and could even see downtown Kyoto if he tilted his head to the right. He had seen a view similar to this earlier when he had done the same to reach the top of the tree, but this was on a much grander level. With the city stretched out in front of him, Shinji couldn't help but smile. His AT-field had its uses afterall, but this was for fun more than anything. He seriously doubted he'd ever have to use it for something like this.  
真嗣继续这样做，直到他到达三角形斜坡的顶部。边缘有一个小缝隙，让真嗣可以坐下，几乎像是栖息在边缘，俯瞰下面的城市。他现在离地面有二十多层楼高，如果他向右倾斜头部，甚至可以看到京都市中心。之前他爬到树顶时也见过类似的景色，但这次规模更大。面对着展现在他面前的城市，真嗣忍不住微笑。他的 AT 力场毕竟有它的用处，但这更多是为了乐趣。他严重怀疑自己是否真的需要用它来做这样的事情。

Deciding that he may as well begin his decent, he peered over the edge, his feet dangling over the side. There was a feeling of vertigo, but also a certain thrill that Shinji felt as he looked over the edge. To anybody that didn't understand what he was doing, they may think imminent suicide was the most obvious outcome. Shinji smirked slightly, and then pushed himself off from his sitting position.  
决定开始下坡，他俯视着边缘，双脚悬在边上。有一种眩晕感，但也伴随着一种刺激感，真嗣在俯视边缘时感受到了。对于不了解他在做什么的人来说，他们可能会认为最明显的结果是即将自杀。真嗣微微一笑，然后从坐姿中推开自己。

The wind rushed against his face, pressing against him far faster than when he had been ascending. From free fall though, twenty stories wasn't very far, and Shinji already had experience injuring himself if he didn't time the fall right. Climbing was always easier than descending.  
风猛烈地扑打在他的脸上，以远超他上升时的速度压迫着他。但从自由落体来看，二十层楼并不算太高，而且真嗣已经有经验，如果他没把握好落下的时机，就会受伤。攀爬总是比下降容易。

Twisting his body around, he created a platform within a fraction of a second, and bounded off of it, creating wind resistance as his body slowed itself down from suddenly altering the direction. A normal human body would have been pounded by the sudden change in force, but Shinji bore it easily. He slowed himself down, altering his direction using his AT-field and his own two feet, creating enough force to slow his fall.  
他扭动身体，在一瞬间内创造出一个平台，然后从上面跳开，利用风阻使身体减速，突然改变方向。一个普通人的身体可能会被这突如其来的力量冲击，但真嗣轻松承受住了。他利用 AT 力场和自己的双脚改变方向，产生足够的力道来减缓下落速度。

As he passed the five story mark, he stopped worrying about changing his direction now that he had slowed himself down considerably, and contended with creating the occasional platform. He still had to be careful with the timing though, as one false projection could screw everything up. Concentration and timing was what he had gathered from his practice, and while it was considerably better, he still hadn't reached the unconscious thought, and still required the use of his right arm every time he projected his AT-field.  
当他经过五层楼的高度时，他不再担心改变方向，因为他已经大大减缓了自己的速度，并开始专注于偶尔创造平台。尽管如此，他仍然必须小心计时，因为一次错误的投影可能会毁掉一切。从练习中他总结出，专注和时机是关键，虽然现在有所改善，但他仍未达到无意识思考的境界，每次投影 AT 力场时仍需使用右臂。

Shinji lightly touched down on a spot not far from where he had started, decreasing his speed to a point that the impact was hardly felt. Looking up at the buildings above him, he had to shield his eyes from the sun to see how far he had just come. It was one thing to do that in a dense forest, but another thing entirely to do this in a once populated area. Shinji couldn't help but grin, wondering what somebody who was just passing by would think if they had seen this supernatural happenstance. Be that as it may, the only person that would likely ever see this was Asuka, and Shinji highly doubted she'd ever see it either.  
真嗣轻轻降落在他起始点不远处，减缓速度以至于落地时几乎感觉不到冲击。抬头望向头顶的建筑物，他不得不遮住眼睛以避开阳光，看看自己刚刚飞了多远。在密集的森林中这样做是一回事，但在曾经人口密集的地区则是另一回事。真嗣忍不住笑了，想知道如果有人恰好路过看到这种超自然现象会怎么想。尽管如此，唯一可能看到这一幕的人只有明日香，而真嗣高度怀疑她是否也会看到。

Taking his time, he wandered back to his truck, thinking that enough time had probably passed now. The sun was in the midst of setting afterall.  
他不慌不忙地漫步回到自己的卡车旁，心想现在时间应该已经足够了。毕竟，太阳正处在落山的过程中。

Shinji still took his time as he drove home, hardly pushing the car over forty-five, and unknowingly, obeying the traffic speeds on the highway. He hoped that Asuka was done by now with whatever she had planned, though even if she wasn't, Shinji didn't think he could waste several more hours. He had already reached his limit, and he had wanted to spend as much time with Asuka today, which was turning out to be quite the opposite of what he had intended.  
真嗣依然不紧不慢地开车回家，几乎没有将车速推到四十五以上，不知不觉中，他遵守着高速公路上的限速。他希望明日香现在已经完成了她计划的事情，尽管即使她还没完成，真嗣也不认为自己还能再浪费几个小时。他已经达到了极限，而且他原本想今天尽可能多地和明日香在一起，结果却与他的初衷大相径庭。

Driving through the small town, he took the familiar path back home, and minutes later, pulled into the driveway in front of the their garage. He almost half expected Asuka to come running from the patio, declaring that he was back far too soon and that he needed to turn right around again. No such thing happened, but Shinji sorta wished she would have at least come out to greet him.  
驾车穿过小镇，他沿着熟悉的路线回家，几分钟后，他把车停在了车库前的车道上。他几乎半期待着明日香会从露台上跑出来，宣称他回来得太早，需要立刻再出发。但这样的事情并没有发生，不过真嗣有点希望她至少能出来迎接他。

Stepping out of his truck, he walked around the side of the house, and opened the sliding door. A wide range of aromas assaulted his nostrils, none of which he could accurately place. Thinking it a bit early to start dinner, he glanced over at the kitchen, but was surprised to see each countertop strewn with an odd assortment of things. Shinji was about to walk over and examine things closer though, when he heard a low moan coming from the couch.  
从卡车里走出来，他绕到房子的一侧，打开了滑动门。一股混合的香气扑鼻而来，他却无法准确辨认出任何一种。心想晚餐时间似乎还早，他瞥向厨房，却惊讶地发现每个台面上都散落着各种奇怪的东西。正要走过去仔细查看时，他听到了沙发处传来的一声低吟。

Asuka was laying there, her legs drawn of towards her chest and her face tilted towards the fireplace. She was sleeping, though it seemed to be rather fitful. Shinji watched her for several seconds, kneeling beside her, and gazing into her face. This wasn't the first time he had done this, and neither would it be the last, but Shinji suddenly leaned in and kissed her as she slept.  
明日香躺在那里，双腿蜷缩向胸前，脸庞朝向壁炉。她在睡觉，但看起来睡得并不安稳。真嗣跪在她身旁，凝视着她的脸，几秒钟过去了。这不是他第一次这样做，也不会是最后一次，但真嗣突然俯身在她熟睡时吻了她。

Whatever she had been dreaming about, was quickly turned aside as Asuka's eyes flew wide open, and for one moment, Shinji thought that she would pushed him away, but she instead kissed him back ferociously, grabbing the collar of his shirt and pulling him onto the couch. Shinji hadn't quite expected this reaction, as Asuka was usually more annoyed with him waking her up in such a manner, but it appeared she was eager to see him as well.  
无论她之前梦见了什么，此刻都被迅速抛诸脑后，因为明日香的双眼猛地睁大，有那么一瞬间，真嗣以为她会推开他，但她却反而激烈地回吻起来，抓住他的衬衫领口，将他拽倒在沙发上。真嗣并未料到这样的反应，毕竟明日香通常会因为他以这种方式唤醒她而感到恼火，但看来她也很渴望见到他。

They fell into a daze as they kissed each other, but something must have reminded Asuka of what she had been doing before she fell asleep, because she suddenly pushed Shinji off her, and sat bolt upright, her eyes darting over to the kitchen.  
他们在亲吻中陷入恍惚，但某件事一定提醒了明日香她入睡前的行为，因为她突然将真嗣推开，笔直地坐起身来，目光迅速扫向厨房。

"God damn it!" Asuka swore rather loudly.  
“该死！”明日香大声咒骂道。

"Asuka wha-" "明日香，什——"

"Shinji, go upstairs. Now!"  
"真嗣，上楼去。现在！"

Shinji didn't need to be told twice, not when Asuka's tone was that serious. Scrambling upstairs, he could already hear the grumbling coming from Asuka as she marched into the kitchen, and the distinct scrape of plates and pans as they were moved around the kitchen. Shinji could only surmise that whatever she was doing, wasn't done, or it was, and that Shinji had almost seen something he shouldn't have.  
真嗣不需要被提醒两次，尤其是当明日香的语气如此严肃时。他急忙上楼，已经能听到明日香走进厨房时的咕哝声，以及厨房里盘子和锅具被挪动的清晰声响。真嗣只能推测，无论她在做什么，要么还没完成，要么已经完成了，而真嗣差点看到了不该看的东西。

---

Shinji attempted to keep himself occupied while upstairs, but after twenty minutes of nothing to do, he calmly walked downstairs and entered the study, searching for something to read. While he was doing this, Asuka came up behind him and handed him the book that he had been reading earlier. It had been left in the living room, so Shinji assumed that was far too close to the kitchen, but Asuka was taking pity on him it seemed.  
真嗣试图让自己在上楼时保持忙碌，但二十分钟无所事事之后，他平静地走下楼，进入书房，寻找一些可读的东西。正当他这么做时，明日香从他身后走来，递给他之前在读的那本书。书被遗留在客厅，真嗣以为那离厨房太近了，但看来明日香是在同情他。

"How much longer is this going to take?" voiced Shinji after Asuka had handed him the book.  
“这还要多久？”真嗣在明日香递给他书后问道。

"As long as it does," replied Asuka as she turned away from him, her snappish attitude resurfacing for a brief moment.  
“该多久就多久，”明日香回答，转身离开他，她那急躁的态度短暂地再次浮现。

So, Shinji was stuck reading upstairs, his back resting against the headboard of their bed, and his legs drawn up in front of him. He was glad it was a paperback, so he could read with one hand if he wanted to, but he was constantly setting the book aside, and listening for any noise downstairs. Asuka may be frustrated over what she was dong, but she was careful at the very least, not letting anything drift upstairs for Shinji's ears.  
于是，真嗣只能待在楼上读书，背靠床头板，双腿蜷缩在身前。幸好是平装本，他想用一只手读也行，但他总是把书搁到一边，留心听着楼下的动静。明日香或许对她正在做的事情感到沮丧，但至少她很小心，不让任何声音飘到楼上让真嗣听见。

When it was becoming far too difficult for Shinji to handle, and with the sun fast setting, he was about to go downstairs against Asuka's wishes, when he heard the slow footfalls of someone coming upstairs. He saw her before they spoke, as Asuka's figure appeared in the hallway, walking towards the bedroom. She didn't say anything as she entered, but just collapsed on the bed, forcing Shinji to move his feet out of the way.  
当真嗣觉得越来越难以忍受，而太阳也迅速西沉时，他正准备违背明日香的意愿下楼去，这时他听到了有人缓缓上楼的脚步声。在他们说话之前，他就看到了她，明日香的身形出现在走廊里，朝卧室走来。她走进来时什么也没说，只是倒在床上，迫使真嗣把脚挪开。

"You alright?" asked Shinji, slightly worried about her.  
“你还好吗？”真嗣问道，略微担心她。

"Uhhh," was all that Asuka could reply with.  
"呃," 这就是明日香能回答的全部了。

Shinji placed the book on the nightstand beside him, and then sat up, crawling across the bed to sit beside Asuka. He slowly rubbed her back, since she was laying on her stomach, but she didn't say anything, only letting out a small groan.  
真嗣把书放在他旁边的床头柜上，然后坐起身，爬过床坐在明日香旁边。他慢慢地揉着她的背，因为她趴着，但她什么也没说，只是发出了一声轻微的呻吟。

"So, did you get everything done?"  
"那么，你把所有事情都完成了吗？"

"...Sorta," was all Asuka replied with.  
"...算是吧," 明日香只这么回答道。

She sat up though, because they didn't have any time to waste. Grabbing Shinji's hand, she tugged him off the bed, ignoring the protests that he flung in her direction. They were running on limited time, and Asuka was not about to let her efforts be in vain.  
但她还是坐了起来，因为他们没有时间可以浪费。她抓住真嗣的手，拉着他离开床铺，无视他发出的抗议。他们的时间有限，明日香绝不允许自己的努力白费。

When they entered the living room, Shinji saw something that he had not expected to see. Both of their camping backpacks from months ago were placed next to the sliding door, and something else which Shinji could only imagine bore the bulk of Asuka's frustration. Just seeing it, Shinji could guess how difficult it was to put together. When he turned to Asuka to ask about this though, she just shushed him, and handed his own camping backpack to him. It was light, but there was unmistakably something inside. Slinging her own over her shoulders, and then grabbing the basket beside her, she took his hand and walked outside.  
当他们走进客厅时，真嗣看到了一件他未曾预料到的景象。几个月前的两个露营背包被放在滑动门旁，还有一件东西，真嗣只能想象它承载了明日香大部分的怒气。光是看到它，真嗣就能猜到组装起来有多困难。当他转向明日香想询问时，她只是嘘了一声，并递给他自己的露营背包。虽然很轻，但里面显然装了东西。她把自己的背包甩到肩上，然后抓起旁边的篮子，牵着他的手走了出去。

Asuka led the way, but as they started walking in a familiar direction, Shinji began to understand what she had thought. They didn't come down this way very often, but they had kept it well tended for the most part, thanks to Shinji's AT-field. It was just a matter of trimming back the brush, and making sure the grass didn't grow very high. Even so, with the sun almost gone, walking through the dense forest was like trying to walk through an underground cave, but Asuka had thankfully thought to bring a flashlight. Though it was almost night, the air wasn't cool, but still fairly warm.  
明日香领路在前，但随着他们开始朝熟悉的方向行进，真嗣逐渐明白了她的想法。他们并不常走这条路，但多亏了真嗣的 AT 力场，大部分时间都维护得很好。只需修剪一下灌木，确保草不会长得太高。即便如此，随着太阳几乎消失，穿越茂密的森林就像试图穿越地下洞穴，但幸运的是，明日香想到了带上手电筒。尽管夜幕降临，空气并不凉爽，依然相当温暖。

They didn't talk to each other, but Asuka continued holding Shinji's hand as they walked. She wasn't afraid of losing him in the dark, but the extra warmth of his hand kept her reassured.  
他们没有交谈，但明日香继续握着真嗣的手前行。她并不担心在黑暗中失去他，但他的手带来的额外温暖让她感到安心。

Eventually, they broke through the group of trees, and stepped into the field. It was nearly twilight, and the green grass was just barely visible in the disappearing light. Asuka frowned, wishing that she hadn't fallen asleep earlier, since they'd have more light if she had gotten done sooner, but that was also why she had decided to bring both the backpacks.  
最终，他们穿过了树丛，踏入了田野。已是黄昏时分，绿草在逐渐消失的光线中隐约可见。明日香皱起眉头，后悔之前睡过头了，如果她早点完成，他们会有更多的光线，但这也是她决定带上两个背包的原因。

Letting go of Shinji's hand, Asuka placed the basket on the grass, and then unslung her pack, going through its content. Shinji didn't say anything to her, his eyes fixed on the sky above them. The stars were already starting to come out, and he could see the distinct line of the Milky Way galaxy above them that was sometimes visible on clear nights. Turning his attention to Asuka, he saw what she had been rummaging around for.  
放开真嗣的手，明日香将篮子放在草地上，然后卸下背包，翻找里面的东西。真嗣没有对她说什么，他的目光凝视着头顶的天空。星星已经开始闪现，他能看到银河系那条有时在晴朗夜晚清晰可见的明显线条。转而看向明日香，他发现她一直在寻找的东西。

She had pulled out some scraps of paper, and a couple of small stones, which she placed in a ring. Walking back to the edge of the forest, she gathered some dry leaves and small branches, placing them in the ring of stones. Dumping the paper on the stack, she pulled some matches out of a pocket in her backpack, and lit the paper. It immediately caught, the fire licking the leaves and branches until the fire was threatening to spill out of the ring of stones. The dry grass underneath it was immediately charred black, and Asuka had to be careful not to let the fire spread any further.  
她拿出一些碎纸片和几块小石头，摆成一个圈。走回森林边缘，她收集了一些干树叶和小树枝，放在石头圈里。将纸片倒在堆上，她从背包的口袋里掏出一些火柴，点燃了纸片。火立刻燃起，舔舐着树叶和树枝，直到火势似乎要溢出石头圈。下面的干草立刻被烧成黑色，明日香不得不小心不让火势蔓延。

When she felt it was satisfactory, she motioned to Shinji to pass his backpack to him. Shinji did so without question, and Asuka pulled out a bundle of blankets, one of which she placed on the ground, spreading it out so at least four people could easily sit on it without spilling onto the grass. The others she placed off to the side for now.  
当她觉得满意时，她示意真嗣把他的背包递给她。真嗣毫不犹豫地照做了，而明日香从背包里拿出了一捆毯子，其中一条她铺在地上，展开后足够四个人轻松坐下而不至于滑到草地上。其他的她暂时放在一边。

Finishing with these preparations, Asuka finally grabbed the basket and placed it beside her. Letting out a low sigh, she glanced over at Shinji and then motioned for him to sit next to her. Shinji did so with hesitation, and was about to say something, when Asuka interrupted him.  
完成这些准备工作后，明日香终于拿起篮子，放在她旁边。她轻轻叹了口气，瞥了一眼真嗣，然后示意他坐在她旁边。真嗣犹豫了一下，坐了下来，正要开口说什么，却被明日香打断了。

"Don't say anything. I'm in charge here."  
“什么也别说。这里我说了算。”

Shinji swallowed what he had been about to say, but nodded all the same.  
真嗣咽下了原本要说的话，但还是点了点头。

Slowly, Asuka began passing him things. Shinji had no idea how much she put into the moderately sized basket, but the rice itself probably filled the very bottom of the basket at least. It was sealed in a plastic container, neatly packed inside, and sprinkled with a very minute amount of garlic. They ate it together, shared between them using the utensils that Asuka had provided, while the fire continued roaring in front of them.  
慢慢地，明日香开始递给他东西。真嗣不知道她往那个中等大小的篮子里放了多少，但至少那盒米饭可能已经填满了篮子的底部。它被密封在一个塑料容器里，整齐地包装在内，并撒上了一点点大蒜。他们一起吃着，用明日香提供的餐具分享，而火在他们面前继续熊熊燃烧。

After the rice, Asuka continued bringing more thinks out. Now that Shinji saw everything, it was obvious that Asuka had tried to create a picnic of sorts, but there were obvious things that she couldn't simply work around, so she had created something herself. Canned vegetables had been sautéed in a manner of ways, creating something that you'd never guess had come from a can. A rich soup, hand craft by Asuka, was so strong that Shinji had to reach for a cup of tea more than once. The soup and tea were supplied by large thermoses for each, and Shinji wondered where Asuka had found them, since he had certainly never seen them in their house before.

Shinji was always glad whenever Asuka decided to cook, since it gave him a break, but their was also something else. Knowing that she specifically was thinking of him while she cooked, and in particular, this meal, always brought a smile to his face.  
每当明日香决定做饭时，真嗣总是感到高兴，因为这让他得以休息，但还有别的原因。知道她做饭时特别想着他，尤其是这顿饭，总是让他脸上露出微笑。

When the different food sources started to taper off, and Asuka was beginning to pack everything back in the basket, Shinji fell onto his back, and placed his hands behind his head, looking up at the sky. The stars were almost fully in bloom above him in the night sky now, and the moon was just started to shed some light onto the field where he lay. It was a wonderful night Shinji thought.  
当不同的食物来源开始减少，明日香开始将所有东西重新装回篮子时，真嗣仰面躺下，双手枕在脑后，仰望着天空。星星几乎完全在夜空中绽放，月亮也开始将一些光芒洒在他躺着的田野上。真嗣觉得这是一个美妙的夜晚。

Wordlessly, he heard rustling coming from Asuka's direction, and glanced over at her. She was finished packing everything back into the basket, and was now gathering up the blankets she had tossed to the side earlier. Nudging her way over to Shinji, she grabbed one of the larger blankets, and tossed it over himself, before laying down beside him, and crawling under the blanket as well.  
他默默地听到明日香那边传来窸窣声，便瞥向她。她已经把所有东西重新装回篮子，现在正收拾起之前扔到一边的毯子。她轻轻挪到真嗣身边，拿起一条较大的毯子，扔在他身上，然后躺在他旁边，也钻进了毯子下。

"Asuka, thanks for this," said Shinji as he continued to look at her. "It was a nice change of pace from what we've been doing recently. Just laying out here, I feel relaxed."  
“明日香，谢谢你这么做，”真嗣继续看着她说道，“这和我们最近做的事情相比，真是让人心情舒畅。只是躺在这里，我就感到放松。”

Asuka didn't say anything. She was looking up the sky, but there seemed to be something on her mind. Noticing this, Shinji propped himself on one arm to get a better look at her and asked, "Something wrong Asuka?"  
明日香没有说话。她仰望着天空，但似乎心事重重。注意到这一点，真嗣用一只手臂撑起自己，以便更好地观察她，并问道：“有什么不对劲吗，明日香？”

Again, she didn't say anything, but she did react. Slowly turning towards him, Asuka placed her hand on Shinji's chest, and pushed him onto his back. Dragging the blanket with her, Asuka mounted Shinji, and then leaned into his chest, resting her entire body on his.  
她再次沉默，但确实有了反应。明日香缓缓转向他，将手放在真嗣的胸前，将他推倒。她拽着毯子，跨坐在真嗣身上，然后俯身贴近他的胸膛，全身倚靠在他身上。

"Asuka?" wondered Shinji.  
"明日香？" 真嗣疑惑道。

"...Like I said, I'm in charge right now," mumbled Asuka, before she tilted her head upwards and kissed him.  
"……就像我说的，现在我负责，" 明日香咕哝着，然后她抬起头，吻了他。

Shinji had rather expected this, but not in a position like this. He could feel Asuka's warm body pressing against his own, her waist against his, her breasts pressing against his chest, and then he felt a reaction from his own waist.  
真嗣对此有所预料，但没想到会是在这样的情况下。他能感受到明日香温暖的身躯紧贴着自己，她的腰抵着他的，她的胸部压在他的胸膛上，接着他感到自己腰部有了反应。

'Not now,' thought Shinji, but Asuka just continued kissing him, not caring about the thing poking against her hips. Besides, Asuka was feeling aroused as well.  
"'现在不行，' 真嗣心想，但明日香只是继续吻着他，不在乎那抵在她腰间的东西。而且，明日香也感到兴奋。

While she continued kissing him, Asuka ran her hands along Shinji chest. Shinji was tall, though rather skinny, but Asuka could still feel his muscles. She wondered whether this was from his natural body's composition, or if the months of chopping firewood had finally bulked him up a bit. Neither really matter, but Asuka did enjoy the feel.  
"在她继续吻他的同时，明日香用手抚摸着真嗣的胸膛。真嗣虽然高，但相当瘦，不过明日香仍能感受到他的肌肉。她想知道这是他天生的体格，还是几个月砍柴终于让他壮实了一些。其实这些都不重要，但明日香确实喜欢这种感觉。

Asuka played with the hem of his shirt, and his collar. She was debating on something, but not sure whether she wanted to take another step. Shinji didn't have any clue, and just continued kissing her as they lay with each other. Taking the initiative, Shinji's tongue entered Asuka's mouth, kissing her deeply, and for a moment, Asuka completely forgot what she was attempting to do, loosing herself entirely in the kiss. Around them, small animals began to roam the night, but both were oblivious to this.  
"明日香摆弄着他的衬衫下摆和衣领。她在考虑某件事，但不确定是否要迈出下一步。真嗣毫无头绪，只是继续与她相拥而吻。真嗣主动出击，舌头探入明日香的口中，深情地吻着她，一时间，明日香完全忘记了她原本打算做什么，完全沉浸在这个吻中。周围，小动物开始在夜晚游荡，但两人对此浑然不觉。

Breaking off the kiss momentarily, Asuka drew back from Shinji, sitting on his waist and looking down at him. She was biting her lip seductively, her body silhouetted against the fire behind her. Shinji nearly gave into his animals instincts, and probably would have pushed her down if Asuka hadn't moved. Leaning back down towards Shinji, he expected her to continue kissing him, but instead, she attacked from a different angle.  
暂时中断亲吻，明日香从真嗣身上退开，坐在他的腰间俯视着他。她性感地咬着嘴唇，身体在背后的火焰映衬下形成剪影。真嗣几乎要屈服于自己的本能冲动，如果不是明日香先动了的话，他可能已经把她推倒了。她再次俯身向真嗣，他以为她会继续亲吻他，但她却从另一个角度发起了攻势。

Her hands grabbed the hem of his shirt, and began pulling it up over his head. Shinji started at this, but Asuka sealed his muted reply with a sudden forceful kiss, her tongue immediately entwining with his. Whatever protest Shinji was about to make melted away, being replaced by eagerness. Breaking off the kiss, Shinji let Asuka remove his shirt the rest of the way so that his chest was bare. Asuka looked down at Shinji's chest unsure exactly what she was doing. She had seen his bare chest plenty of times by now, but this was the first time she was ever this close. Placing her hand on his skin, she felt Shinji shiver at her touch, and thought she felt him grow even harder at the waist. Asuka wasn't sure how far she wanted to take this.  
她的双手抓住他衬衫的下摆，开始向上拉过他的头顶。真嗣对此感到惊讶，但明日香用一个突然而有力的吻封住了他未出口的回应，她的舌头立刻与他缠绕在一起。真嗣原本要提出的任何抗议都消融了，取而代之的是急切。中断亲吻后，真嗣让明日香继续脱掉他的衬衫，直到他的胸膛裸露出来。明日香低头看着真嗣的胸膛，不太确定自己在做什么。她现在已经多次见过他的裸胸，但这是她第一次如此近距离地接触。她把手放在他的皮肤上，感觉到真嗣因她的触摸而颤抖，她甚至觉得他的腰部变得更硬了。明日香不确定她想把这件事做到什么程度。

Running her hands along his chest, she traced out the groves of his ribcage, following up to his collarbone, and then to his shoulder. Shinji squirmed immensely as she did this, and even more so when Asuka's silky hair brushed against his skin. She was certainly teasing him now, but Shinji didn't have the means of retaliating right now.  
她用手沿着他的胸膛滑过，描绘着他肋骨的轮廓，一路向上至锁骨，再到肩膀。真嗣在这过程中极力扭动着身体，当明日香柔滑的发丝拂过他的肌肤时，他更是如此。她现在显然是在挑逗他，但真嗣此刻却无力反击。

Asuka continued exploring Shinji's upper body, not leaving any part of it untouched. Whenever Shinji was about to voice his thoughts, Asuka would silence him with a quick kiss, to which Shinji would lapse back into a daze. It was hard for him to believe that Asuka was doing this right now, but she had wanted this it seemed.  
明日香继续探索着真嗣的上半身，不放过任何一个部位。每当真嗣想要表达自己的想法时，明日香就会用一个快速的吻让他安静下来，真嗣随即又陷入恍惚之中。他很难相信明日香此刻正在这样做，但似乎她确实渴望如此。

Seeming to be done with her exploration, Asuka let out a deep sigh. She didn't want to admit it, but she was aroused just by being this near to Shinji. Her hands against his chest, his body heat against her own; everything was making Asuka's body excited. She tried ignoring a certain wetness that was spreading between her legs, but this was a sure sign of her arousal. If she took another step, she wasn't sure what would happen.  
似乎完成了她的探索，明日香深深地叹了口气。她不想承认，但仅仅是靠近真嗣就让她感到兴奋。她的手贴在他的胸膛上，他的体温与她自己的交融；一切都让明日香的身体感到兴奋。她试图忽视双腿间逐渐蔓延的湿润感，但这无疑是她兴奋的明确迹象。如果她再进一步，她不确定会发生什么。

"Asuka, you alright?" asked Shinji.  
“Asuka，你还好吗？”真嗣问道。

Shinji asked this because Asuka had stopped what she was doing, but was sitting silently on Shinji's lap for a good minute now. She was looking at him, but at the same time, she wasn't, contemplating something in her own mind.  
真嗣这样问是因为 Asuka 突然停下了手头的事情，已经静静地坐在真嗣的腿上有一分钟了。她看着他，却又似乎没在看他，心里在想着什么。

"Sorry...what?" mumbled Asuka.  
“抱歉……你说什么？”Asuka 含糊地回应。

Shinji frowned, but then sat up to get a better look at her, the resulting shift in body position making Asuka inhale suddenly. They were inches away from each other now, with Asuka still sitting in Shinji's lap. Asuka bit her lip, but in was in frustration now. She didn't know what she wanted at this point. She wanted to continue, but was unsure.  
真嗣皱了皱眉，但还是坐起身来，以便更清楚地看向她，这一动作使得坐在他腿上的明日香突然深吸了一口气。他们现在相距仅几英寸，明日香依然坐在真嗣的腿上。明日香咬了咬嘴唇，但这次是出于沮丧。她此刻也不知道自己想要什么。她想继续，却又犹豫不决。

"Asuka...if you want to stop, I understand."  
“明日香……如果你想停下来，我理解。”

Asuka didn't meet his gaze, but looked away, her face a mixture of frustration and longing. They couldn't go all the way, that much was certain, but Asuka had hoped for more.  
明日香没有直视他的目光，而是转过头去，脸上混杂着沮丧与渴望。他们不能做到最后，这一点是肯定的，但明日香曾希望有更多的进展。

Shinji continued watching the different emotions Asuka was battling with. Shinji was still bare chested, but he hardly seemed to notice. His eyes were transfixed on Asuka. Whatever Shinji wanted was null void unless he heard something from Asuka.  
真嗣继续观察着明日香正在与之斗争的各种情绪。真嗣仍然赤裸着上身，但他似乎并未察觉。他的目光紧紧锁定在明日香身上。无论真嗣想要什么，除非他听到明日香的话，否则都毫无意义。

"...Hey Shinji? asked Asuka in a weak voice.  
“……嘿，真嗣？”明日香用微弱的声音问道。

"...Yes?" “……嗯？”

"...Hold me." "...抱紧我。"

Shinji did so, with any hesitation, wrapping his arms around Asuka, and held her to his bare chest. Shinji didn't know what else she wanted, but at the very least, he could do this.  
真嗣毫不犹豫地照做了，双臂环绕着明日香，将她拥入自己赤裸的胸膛。真嗣虽不清楚她还需要什么，但至少，他可以做到这一点。

Asuka's hands were at her side, and she wasn't sure what she wanted to do with them. She could easily hold Shinji as well, but she didn't think this was it. She wanted more, she wanted what she had done for Shinji.  
明日香的手垂在身侧，她不确定自己想用它们做什么。她完全可以同样抱住真嗣，但她觉得这并非她所渴望的。她想要更多，她想要为真嗣做过的那种感觉。

Slowly, she moved her hands, and then placed them on Shinji's arm, grasping him slightly. Asuka directed his arms away from her back slowly. Shinji was only following, not having a clue what Asuka was doing. Asuka searched Shinji's eyes for any sign of expectance, though all she could see was puzzlement. It wasn't surprising that he didn't understand what Asuka was about to do.  
她缓缓移动双手，然后轻轻搭在真嗣的手臂上，稍稍握住。明日香慢慢引导他的手臂离开她的背部。真嗣只是顺从地跟随，完全不明白明日香在做什么。明日香在真嗣的眼中寻找着期待的迹象，但她看到的只有困惑。他不懂明日香即将要做的事，这并不令人意外。

Letting out her worries in a deep exhale, Asuka directed Shinji's hands to her waist, and then slowly up her bare back. At first, Shinji didn't realize what Asuka was doing, or telling him silently. Shinji's hands were gliding across her skin, the fabric of her shirt brushing against his knuckles. Asuka let go of Shinji's hands, and they began to move on their own. Asuka shivered at his touch, scrunching her face up, but this was when Shinji kissed her. The kiss had been hesitant, but Asuka replied with force, pushing Shinji back to the ground.  
明日香深吸一口气，将心中的忧虑释放出来，她引导真嗣的手放在她的腰间，然后缓缓向上滑过她裸露的背部。起初，真嗣并未意识到明日香在做什么，或是无声地告诉他什么。他的手在她肌肤上滑行，衬衫的布料轻拂过他的指节。明日香松开了真嗣的手，它们开始自行移动。明日香的身子因他的触碰而微微颤抖，她皱起眉头，但就在这时，真嗣吻了她。那个吻带着犹豫，但明日香以力量回应，将真嗣推倒在地。

Shinji's hands were now halfway along Asuka's back, her shirt pushed up, exposing her waist and lower back. With every touch and caress, Asuka shivered, her body squirming with pleasure and ecstasy. Shinji was far better than Asuka would have thought, and small moans began leaking out of her mouth, all of which were quickly silenced by a kiss. Shinji was careful though as he ran his hands along her back, his hands skipping several times across the clasp to her bra. Her shirt was hiked up far enough for him see her bra if he desired, but the last thing he need was for the clasp to unhook because of his carelessness. It would be a pleasant sight, but his consciousness would likely disappear afterwards.  
真嗣的手已经沿着明日香的后背滑到了一半，她的衬衫被推起，露出了腰际和下背部。每一次触碰和抚摸，明日香都会颤抖，身体因愉悦和狂喜而扭动。真嗣的表现远超明日香的预期，细微的呻吟开始从她口中逸出，随即被一个吻迅速封住。真嗣虽然小心翼翼地在她背上移动双手，但几次都避开了她胸罩的扣子。她的衬衫被推得足够高，如果他愿意，可以看到她的胸罩，但他最不需要的就是因为自己的疏忽而解开扣子。那将是一幅美妙的景象，但之后他的意识很可能会消失。

They became lost in the moment quickly, kissing each other and touching each other. Asuka began brushing her lips along his neck and biting at his ear, to which Shinji replied in turn, kissing Asuka's neck while his fingernails lightly traced themselves along her smooth back. This attack was far too much for Asuka, and Shinji was beginning to get new scars along his back thanks to Asuka's nails.  
他们很快沉浸在这一刻，彼此亲吻和触摸。明日香开始沿着他的脖子轻吻，并轻咬他的耳朵，真嗣则回应着，亲吻明日香的脖子，同时用指甲轻轻划过她光滑的背部。这对明日香来说太过强烈，真嗣的背上也开始因明日香的指甲而留下新的伤痕。

After what seemed like hours, they finally paused after a long kiss, and then Asuka sank onto Shinji's chest, panting wildly. Shinji was panting himself, which was nearly unheard of for him. Both of their bodies were slick with sweat, as though they had just run several miles. Though night had long set in, both were burning up with what felt like a fever, but it was just their bodies rubbing against one another.  
仿佛过了几个小时，他们终于在一次长吻后停了下来，随后明日香瘫倒在真嗣的胸膛上，气喘吁吁。真嗣也在喘息，这对他来说几乎是前所未闻的。两人的身体都汗流浃背，仿佛刚跑了好几英里。尽管夜幕早已降临，但他们都感觉像是在发高烧，其实只是身体相互摩擦所致。

Letting out a heavy sigh, Shinji ran his hands through his hair, wishing that he could take a cool swim to rinse the sweat off himself, but he didn't think he'd be getting up anytime soon. Asuka it seemed was nodding off, the exhaustion apparent on her face, and Shinji had to rouse her before she tilted her head up to look at him.  
真嗣重重地叹了口气，用手梳理着头发，希望自己能跳进清凉的水中洗去汗水，但他觉得短时间内自己可能起不来。明日香似乎快要睡着了，脸上的疲惫显而易见，真嗣不得不唤醒她，她这才抬起头来看着他。

"Why did you do that? I was about to fall asleep."  
“你干嘛呀？我正要睡着呢。”

"It's a bit warm to be laying like this."  
“这样躺着有点热。”

Asuka frowned, but nodded in agreement. Sitting up, she pushed her shirt down, glancing over at Shinji, wondering if he had seen anything. Whether he did, he didn't comment, but Asuka supposed that even if he had, she wouldn't care. She was beyond caring about idiotic things like that at this point.  
明日香皱了皱眉，但还是点头同意。她坐起身，拉下衬衫，瞥了一眼真嗣，想知道他是否看到了什么。无论他是否看到，他都没有评论，但明日香想，即使他看到了，她也不在乎。到了这个地步，她已经不在乎那些愚蠢的事情了。

Throwing herself down on the ground next to Shinji, she wrapped herself snuggly in the blankets, and then turned to press herself against him. Shinji hadn't bothered to put his shirt back on, but Asuka didn't mind, and might have preferred it that way.  
她猛地扑倒在真嗣旁边的地上，紧紧裹上毯子，然后转身贴向他。真嗣没费心把衬衫穿回去，但明日香并不介意，甚至可能更喜欢这样。

They had pushed the boundaries further today, but there was still much unsaid. Asuka wasn't sure how she felt about this. She knew how she felt, and she knew how Shinji felt, so it was a simple matter of telling each other their feelings. That being said, for Asuka, it was easier showing, instead of telling.  
他们今天又突破了界限，但仍有许多未说出口的话。明日香不确定自己对此有何感受。她知道自己怎么想，也知道真嗣怎么想，所以问题就在于彼此坦白心意。话虽如此，对明日香来说，表达比说出口更容易。

"Thanks again for today Asuka," mumbled Shinji beside her.  
“今天谢谢你了，明日香。”真嗣在她身旁咕哝道。

Asuka grinned briefly, before she turned her eyes up towards him, and kissed him quickly.  
明日香短暂地笑了笑，然后抬起眼看着他，迅速地吻了他一下。

"You're welcome," smiled Asuka, before she curled herself up next to Shinji, and quickly fell asleep. Shinji fell asleep quickly as well, the fatigue from the night getting a hold of him. Kissing Asuka on the forehead, he thought he heard her mumble something in her sleep, but then shook his head, thinking that he misheard. Even had he heard right, he wanted to hear it from her while she was awake, and not asleep.  
“不客气。”明日香微笑着，随后蜷缩在真嗣身边，很快便进入了梦乡。真嗣也迅速入睡，夜晚的疲惫感紧紧抓住了他。他在明日香额头上轻轻一吻，心想自己似乎听到她在睡梦中喃喃自语，但随即摇了摇头，以为自己听错了。即便他真的听对了，他也希望在她清醒时亲耳听到，而不是在她睡着时。

Pressing his chin against her head, he fell asleep, while above them, the moon shined down on them, and the stars waited to usher in a new dawn.  
他将下巴抵在她的头顶，随即入睡，而他们上方，月亮洒下光辉，星星们静候着迎接新的一天的到来。
