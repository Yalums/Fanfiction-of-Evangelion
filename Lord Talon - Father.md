### Chapter 1
Asuka woke up with a killer headache. It wasn't the first time, in fact it was the third morning in a row. _"I wonder if this is how Misato feels whenever she gets up after a night of drinking,"_ she thought to herself, reeling a bit as her feet hit the floor. The only problem with that thought was she that didn't drink last night, or any other previous night.  
明日香醒来时头痛欲裂，这已经不是第一次了，实际上已经是连续第三天早晨如此。“我猜这大概就是美里每次宿醉醒来时的感觉吧，”她一边想着，一边有些踉跄地踩到地板上。唯一的问题是，她昨晚并没有喝酒，之前的晚上也没有。

_"Well, there was that one time…"_ she thought, remembering that one night a couple of months ago. A blush quickly rose to her cheeks as she tried to push that thought aside, staggering to her feet and leaving her room. The hallway seemed crooked as she slowly made her way to the kitchen, finding Shinji there cooking breakfast as usual. Normally, the smell of his breakfasts were enough to send her stomach rumbling, even though she would never admit that to him. Today, something was different.  
“嗯，有那么一次……”她想着，回忆起几个月前的那一夜。脸颊迅速泛起红晕，她试图将那个念头抛开，踉跄地站起身，离开了房间。走廊在她缓缓走向厨房时显得歪斜。在那里，她发现真嗣像往常一样在做早餐。通常，他做的早餐的香味足以让她的肚子咕咕叫，尽管她绝不会向他承认这一点。但今天，有些不同。

"Morning, Asuka," he cheerfully greeted her as he continued to stir whatever was in the frying pan. "How would you like your eggs this morning?"  
“早上好，明日香。”他愉快地向她打招呼，同时继续搅拌平底锅里的东西。“你今天早上想怎么吃鸡蛋？”

That was the worst question anyone had ever asked her. _"Could he not smell it?"_ she wondered, _"That smell! Those eggs must be rotten! And he expects us to eat them?!"_ Suddenly, she got really queasy. Her hands covered her mouth as she rushed to the bathroom and emptied the contents of her stomach into the toilet. She continued this for several minutes before she realized someone was standing behind her, rubbing her back and keeping her hair out of the toilet.  
这是她听过最糟糕的问题。“他闻不到吗？”她疑惑，“那股味道！那些鸡蛋肯定坏了！他还指望我们吃它们？！”突然间，她感到非常恶心。她双手捂住嘴，冲向浴室，将胃里的东西吐进了马桶。她这样持续了几分钟，直到意识到有人站在她身后，轻拍她的背，帮她把头发从马桶里拨开。

"Oh, god," she moaned as she finally relaxed and sat back on her heels. "Thanks, Misato," she said weakly.  
“哦，天哪，”她终于放松下来，跪坐在脚跟上，呻吟道，“谢谢你，美里。”她虚弱地说。

"Uh, I'm not Misato, but you're welcome anyway," the reply came back.  
“呃，我不是美里，不过不用谢，”对方回答道。

"Shinji?" she exclaimed , surprised by the normally shy boy's actions. She turned and saw the concern in his eyes. Those same eyes she could get lost in, if she wasn't careful, and cause her to melt. "Wha…?"  
“真嗣？”她惊呼道，对平时害羞的男孩的举动感到意外。她转过身，看到了他眼中的关切。那些眼睛，如果不小心，会让她迷失其中，让她融化。“什…？”

"Sorry," he replied, "but I was worried about you. I know you hate help, but you looked like you really needed it."  
“对不起，”他回答，“但我很担心你。我知道你讨厌帮助，但你看起来真的很需要。”

"S'okay," she murmured back, "but now I need to clean up. So get out!" Some of the fire was starting to come back to her eyes. Shinji smiled back at her.  
“没事，”她轻声回应，“但现在我得收拾一下。所以出去吧！”她的眼中开始重新燃起些许怒火。真嗣对她笑了笑。

"When you're done, come back to the kitchen, I'll have some toast ready for you," he said as he started to leave the bathroom.  
“收拾完了就回厨房来，我给你准备点吐司，”他说着开始离开浴室。

"Toast?!" she barked back.  
“吐司？！”她厉声回道。

"Yes, toast," Shinji replied as he slowly closed the door, "best thing for a sour stomach." Asuka fumed for a second, thinking about eggs when another wave of nausea hit.  
“对，吐司，”真嗣边说边慢慢关上门，“对胃不舒服最合适。”明日香气恼了一会儿，想着鸡蛋时又一阵恶心袭来。

"Okay, so toast it is," she told her stomach as she stepped into the shower, letting the hot water wash away the muscle aches and pains.  
“好吧，那就吃吐司吧。”她一边告诉自己的肚子，一边走进淋浴间，任由热水冲刷掉肌肉的酸痛。

Shinji walked back into the kitchen when a voice from behind called out "So, how's she doing?"  
真嗣走回厨房时，身后传来一个声音：“那么，她怎么样了？”

"Arrrrgh!" Shinji yelled as he spun around and saw his other roommate standing behind him. His heart was racing like it wanted to tear from his chest.  
“啊！”真嗣大叫一声，猛地转身，看到另一个室友站在他身后。他的心跳得像是要从胸口蹦出来一样。

"Damn it, Misato! Don't do that!" he gasped, taking huge gulps of air as his body did it's best to metabolize the **huge** amounts of adrenaline that now swept through his veins.  
“该死，美里！别这样！”他喘着粗气，大口吸气，身体竭力代谢着此刻涌入血管的大量肾上腺素。

"Sorry," she said teasingly as she sat down. Shinji gave her the usual morning cup of tea. Not as good as beer, but she had promised Kaji she would cut down on her drinking. "Seriously, how is she doing?"  
“抱歉，”她打趣地说着坐了下来。真嗣递给她早晨惯例的那杯茶。虽然不如啤酒，但她答应过加持会减少饮酒。“说真的，她怎么样了？”

"She's not feeling well," Shinji replied as he cracked open two eggs for Misato's breakfast, "she hasn't called me 'idiot' once."  
“她感觉不太好，”真嗣回答，同时为美里敲开两个鸡蛋准备早餐，“她一次都没叫我‘笨蛋’。”

"Hmm, must be serious," she smirked over the rim of her cup. Shinji hadn't seen her eyes this clear in the mornings, ever.  
“嗯，肯定很严重，”她透过杯沿轻笑。真嗣从未见过她早晨的眼睛如此清澈。

"I'm serious, Misato! This is the third day in a row," he replied as Misato saw how concerned he really was. "Maybe you should take her to see the doctor today."  
“我是认真的，美里！这已经是连续第三天了，”他回答，美里看出他真的很担心。“也许你今天应该带她去看医生。”

"Love to, kiddo, but I have a ton of work that has to be finished today," the Major answered, "Tell you what! I'll make the appointment for this morning and you can take her!"  
很想去，孩子，但我今天有一大堆工作必须完成，"少校回答说，"这样吧！我安排今天上午的预约，你可以带她去！

"Somehow, I don't think Asuka would feel up to a ride on my motorcycle," the young man said as he thought of how he was going to get a sick Asuka to sit behind him and hold his waist as he drove through the streets of Tokyo-3.  
"不知怎么的，我觉得明日香不会想坐我的摩托车，"年轻人想着如何让生病的明日香坐在他后面，抱着他的腰，穿过第三新东京市的街道。

"No silly," Misato added as she tossed Shinji the keys to her car, "I'll take the bike!"  
别傻了，"美里边说边把车钥匙扔给真嗣，"我骑摩托车！

"Oh lord, no!" he said sullenly. "Do you know how hard it was to fix the _last_ time you borrowed it?"  
哦，天哪，别提了！"他沮丧地说，"你知道上次你借走后修起来有多难吗？

"I was drunk then," Misato said absentmindedly, "but I'm sober now! See! Okay!"  
“我当时喝醉了，”美里心不在焉地说，“但现在我清醒了！看！好吧！”

"I don't know if that makes it better or worse," he muttered as Misato stuck her tongue out at him.  
“我不知道这是好是坏，”他喃喃自语，而美里则向他吐了吐舌头。

"Why is Misato taking your bike, Shinji?" a young redhead asked as she plopped down into her chair and started to munch on the dry toast he put in front of her. Amazingly, she did start to feel a little better. Maybe that little turd knew what he was talking about.  
“为什么美里要骑走你的自行车，真嗣？”一个年轻的红发女孩问道，她一屁股坐进椅子，开始啃他放在她面前的干吐司。令人惊讶的是，她确实感觉好些了。也许那个小家伙说得有道理。

"Because he's taking you in the car," was the reply.  
“因为他要开车带你，”真嗣回答道。

"Cool! Going to school in the car! I knew I was glad you got your license for some reason! You may actually be of some use for a change!" smirked Asuka, who then felt a bit bad about the hurt look in his eyes.  
"酷！坐车去学校！我就知道你拿到驾照是有原因的！你或许真的能派上用场，改变一下！" 明日香带着一丝嘲讽说道，随即又因他眼中受伤的神情感到些许内疚。

"Uh, no, we're not going to school today…" Shinji started.  
"呃，不，我们今天不去学校……" 真嗣开口道。

"Yeah! The Mall!" Asuka cheered as she downed her third piece of toast.  
"耶！去商场！" 明日香欢呼着，同时吞下了第三片吐司。

"Not the Mall, either. I'm taking you to see the doctor," he added with a bit of finality.  
"也不是去商场。我带你去看医生，" 他补充道，语气中带着一丝决断。

"Three…two…one…" Misato mumbled.  
"三……二……一……" 美里喃喃自语。

"Whaaaaat?! The doctor?! Why! I'm in perfect health, you idiot!" Asuka screamed as Shinji calmly deflected a piece of toast hurled at his face.  
"什么？！医生？！为什么！我身体好得很，你这个白痴！" 明日香尖叫着，而真嗣冷静地挡开朝他脸上扔来的吐司。

"Asuka! Be reasonable!" Shinji pleaded as the young German kept getting wound up. "This is the third morning in a row. You're not well and you need to see the doctor! I'm worried about you!"  
明日香！讲点道理！" 真嗣恳求道，而年轻的德国女孩情绪越发激动。"这已经是连续第三天了。你状态不好，需要去看医生！我很担心你！

"_He's worried about me?"_ Asuka thought incredulously, _"He cares enough to worry? I wonder if…"_ she pushed that last thought from her mind as her defensive barriers came up. She opened her mouth to let him know that there was nothing to worry about and that she didn't _need_ him to take care of her when Misato chimed in.  
"他在担心我？" 明日香难以置信地想，"他关心到会担心我吗？我在想……" 她把那个念头推开，防御机制启动。她张嘴想告诉他没什么好担心的，她不需要他照顾，这时美里插话了。

"Yeah, maybe it's morning sickness," she said sweetly as she finished off her breakfast.  
"是啊，可能就是孕吐吧，" 她甜甜地说着，吃完了早餐。

"WHAT?!" both teenagers said simultaneously, blushing furiously and turning on her as one. "Shut up, Misato!"  
什么？！" 两个少年同时喊道，脸红得厉害，一起转向她。"闭嘴，美里！

"_That sync training really paid off"_ the violet haired woman thought. "Oh, come on!" she teased, "you're both teenagers, living in the same house, by yourselves quite often. You mean to tell me that you never once…"  
那次同步训练真的见效了。" 紫发女子心想。"哎呀，别这样！" 她逗弄道，"你们俩都是青少年，经常独自住在同一个屋檐下。难道你们就从来没……

"No! Don't be ridiculous!" again in unison. Both turned an interesting shade of red.  
"没有！别胡说！" 又是异口同声。两人的脸都红得发紫。

"_Ha! Both of you have at least thought about it,"_ she mused at seeing their reactions. She grinned as they both turned shame-faced toward each other and then quickly away. "Shinji, call the school and let them know you both will be out today, I'll call the doctor."  
哈！你们俩至少都考虑过这个问题，"她看到他们的反应后沉思道。她笑着看他们俩都羞愧地转向对方，然后又迅速避开目光。"真嗣，给学校打电话告诉他们你们今天都不去了，我会联系医生的。

"Yes ma'am," came the reply as Shinji left the table. Asuka continued to sit there, fuming.  
"是的，女士，"真嗣回答后离开了餐桌。明日香继续坐在那里，气愤不已。

_"Morning sickness? Ha! As if!"  
晨吐？哈！怎么可能！_

_-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------_

"MORNING SICKNESS?!?!?!" a very agitated redhead screamed as she leapt from the table, ready to beat the hell out of the doctor that had just gave her the news.  
"晨吐？！？！？！"一个非常激动的红发女孩尖叫着从桌子上跳起来，准备狠狠揍一顿刚刚给她这个消息的医生。

"Yes, morning sickness, Miss Soryu. You are two months pregnant. Congratulations!" the doctor said quietly as he expected his patient to calm down, which she definitely was _not_ doing.  
“是的，孕吐，惣流小姐。您已经怀孕两个月了。恭喜！”医生轻声说道，期待着病人能平静下来，但她显然没有。

"But…but that's impossible!!" Asuka screamed back.  
“但……这不可能！！”明日香尖叫着回应。

"Trust me, you are most definitely pregnant. While I don't condone two teenagers having intercourse, I do tend to overlook it. This world needs to be repopulated, after all. I've already had my nurse go out and tell your boyfriend, if that's alright?"  
“相信我，你确实怀孕了。虽然我不赞成两个青少年发生性关系，但我倾向于忽略这一点。毕竟，这个世界需要重新繁衍人口。我已经让护士去告诉你的男朋友了，这样可以吗？”

"My boyfriend? Shinji?" Asuka said, somewhat dazed. "Oh, he's not my boyfriend, just my roommate." However, the idea of Shinji being her boyfriend wasn't nearly as upsetting as once it might have been.  
“我的男朋友？真嗣？”明日香有些茫然地说，“哦，他不是我的男朋友，只是室友。”然而，想到真嗣成为她的男朋友，这感觉并不像以前那样令人不快。

"Oh! My mistake!" the doctor replied, "He seemed very nice, I just assumed…" At that exact same moment, a loud yell followed by an even louder thump reverberated through the doors.  
“哦！我的错！”医生回答道，“他看起来很不错，我只是想当然……”就在同一时刻，一声巨响紧接着一个更响的撞击声从门后传来。

"Excuse me, doctor?" a nurse peeked around the door, "We need some smelling salts out here! Miss Soryu's boyfriend has passed out!"  
“打扰一下，医生？”一名护士从门边探出头来，“我们这里需要一些嗅盐！Soryu 小姐的男朋友晕倒了！”

"Shinji?!" Asuka cried out as she rushed from the room and found the young man passed out in the middle of the waiting room. She fell to her knees and placed his head in her lap. "_This is stupid! If anyone needs comfort, it's me!"_ she thought.  
“真嗣？！”明日香喊着冲出房间，发现那个年轻人晕倒在候诊室中央。她跪下身，将他的头放在自己腿上。“这太蠢了！如果有人需要安慰，那应该是我！”她心想。

"Asuka?" Shinji said groggily as she gently stroked his hair, "I just had the weirdest dream…"  
“明日香？”真嗣迷迷糊糊地说，她温柔地抚摸着他的头发，“我刚刚做了个最奇怪的梦……”

"It's not a dream," she said softly, "It's a damn nightmare!" Asuka looked down into his eyes, and saw them filled with sadness, confusion, and…betrayal? She noticed the wet spots forming on his cheeks and see that he's not crying.  
“这不是梦，”她轻声说道，“这是个该死的噩梦！” 明日香低头看着他的眼睛，看到了其中充满了悲伤、困惑，还有……背叛？她注意到他脸颊上形成的湿润痕迹，发现他并没有在哭泣。

Reaching up, Shinji gently caressed her cheek. "It's going to be alright," he said as she broke down and hugged him tightly, sobbing uncontrollable. Shinji wrapped his arms around her and held her gently until the tears stopped.  
伸出手，真嗣温柔地抚摸着她的脸颊。“一切都会好起来的，”他说道，而她崩溃地紧紧抱住他，无法控制地抽泣。真嗣用双臂环绕着她，温柔地抱着她，直到泪水停止。

"Hmm, if he's not, he should be," the doctor muttered as his nurse nodded her head in agreement.  
“嗯，如果他不是，那他应该是，”医生喃喃自语，他的护士点头表示同意。

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The two teenagers sat quietly in the living room, trying to watch TV and doing their best to keep their minds off what was soon to occur. They knew that Misato was going to get a copy of the medical report, seeing how she was their guardian and commanding officer. Shinji was doing everything he could to make Asuka comfortable, which was driving the German girl crazy. Ever since they left the doctor's office, he had grown very protective of her. He had even set a couple of beers on the table, ready for Misato as soon as she came in. He knew that she would need them, even though she was trying to cut back.  
两个少年静静地坐在客厅里，试图看电视，尽力不去想即将发生的事情。他们知道，美里会拿到一份医疗报告，毕竟她是他们的监护人和指挥官。真嗣尽其所能地让明日香感到舒适，这让德国女孩快要疯了。自从他们离开医生的办公室后，他就变得非常保护她。他甚至在桌上放了几瓶啤酒，准备美里一进来就给她。他知道她会需要它们，尽管她正试图减少饮酒。

Shinji and Asuka gulped nervously as they heard the door slide open. "You two. Kitchen. NOW." the Major commanded as the teenagers quickly got up and shuffled to the kitchen. Asuka's head was bowed, refusing to even look up and her guardian. Shinji, on the other hand, held his head high, and gave Misato a look that threw the woman. It screamed: _Watch it!_  
真嗣和明日香紧张地咽了咽口水，听到门滑开的声音。"你们两个。厨房。现在。"少校命令道，两个少年迅速起身，拖着脚步走向厨房。明日香低着头，拒绝抬头看她的监护人。而真嗣则昂首挺胸，给了美里一个眼神，让这位女士愣住了。那眼神仿佛在说：小心点！

Misato sat at the table, looking at the beer before her. Grateful to Shinji, she did one of the hardest things she had ever done: she pushed them aside. Glaring at the redhead, she saw the red puffy eyes and the defeated look on her face. Misato's heart softened a bit at Asuka's state, but was still puzzled at Shinji's reaction. A look of absolute and total concern was plastered on his face as he gazed at Asuka across from him.  
美里坐在桌前，看着面前的啤酒。感激真嗣，她做了她做过的最艰难的事情之一：把它们推开。她瞪着红发女孩，看到她红肿的眼睛和脸上挫败的表情。美里对明日香的状态心软了一些，但对真嗣的反应仍然感到困惑。他脸上贴着绝对而彻底的关切表情，凝视着对面的明日香。

"How?" Misato asked quietly, trying to remain calm, "How can you two be so reckless? Do you have any idea what is at stake here? Do you understand what you have done?" Asuka started to bawl again. Shinji's jaw set in a hard line.  
"怎么回事？"美里轻声问道，试图保持冷静，"你们两个怎么能这么鲁莽？你们知道这里有什么利害关系吗？你们明白自己做了什么吗？"明日香又开始抽泣。真嗣的下巴紧绷成一条硬线。

"Misato, you don't know what you're talking about," Shinji said grimly, shooting daggers into the violet haired woman.  
"美里，你不知道你在说什么，"真嗣冷冷地说，向紫发的女人投去锋利的目光。

"Excuse me?" Misato shot back, trying to stare Shinji back down and failing miserably.  
“你说什么？”美里反问道，试图用目光压倒真嗣，却惨败。

"Shinji's not the father…" Asuka said softly, trying to take the heat off the young man, sniffling as she tried to stem the flow of tears. Shinji looked a bit sad at this.  
“真嗣不是父亲……”明日香轻声说道，试图为年轻人解围，她抽泣着试图止住泪水。真嗣对此显得有些悲伤。

"If Shinji's not, just who the hell is?!" yelled Misato, causing Asuka to cringe. Shinji shot to his feet, fists clinched tight.  
“如果真嗣不是，那他妈的到底是谁？！”美里大喊道，让明日香畏缩了。真嗣猛地站起身，双拳紧握。

"Don't yell at her," he growled as Shinji's eyes burned with an intensity that Misato had never seen. He looked ready to take a swing at his guardian.  
“别对她大吼大叫，”他咆哮着，真嗣的眼神中燃烧着美里从未见过的强烈光芒。他看起来准备对监护人挥拳相向。

"Shinji, it's okay," Asuka said gently as she reached over and placed her hand over his fist. The result was immediate, as the young man visibly relaxed and sat back down. Misato was surprised at Asuka's actions. As far as she knew, the young girl would have never let anyone come to her defense, let alone hold that person's hand.  
"真嗣，没关系的，"明日香温柔地说道，她伸出手，轻轻覆盖在他的拳头上。效果立竿见影，年轻人明显放松下来，重新坐下。美里对明日香的行为感到惊讶。就她所知，这个年轻女孩从未让任何人来为她辩护，更不用说握住那个人的手了。

"I don't know who the father is, Misato," Asuka said sadly, "I don't ever remember having sex! Ever!" Misato could see the truth in her eyes and hear it in her voice.  
"我不知道父亲是谁，美里，"明日香悲伤地说，"我根本不记得有过性行为！从来没有！"美里能从她的眼神和声音中看出真相。

"Okay, I'm sorry for jumping to conclusions," Misato said as she tried to defuse the situation. She swore Shinji looked ready to explode any second. "This is just…the situation…oh god, I'd don't know what to think!"  
好吧，我为过早下结论道歉，"美里试图缓和局势，她发誓真嗣看起来随时都可能爆发。"这情况……天啊，我都不知道该怎么想了！

"How do you think we feel?" Shinji added as he looked longingly at Asuka.  
"你觉得我们是什么感受？"真嗣补充道，深情地看着明日香。

"_We?"_ Misato thought before continuing. "Okay, you're pregnant, but you say you don't ever remember having sex? What can you remember?"  
我们？" 美里想了想，继续说道，"好吧，你说你怀孕了，但又说自己从未记得有过性行为？你能记得些什么？

"Not much," Asuka began, "The only thing I can sort of remember is a disturbing dream." The dream really wasn't disturbing before, she actually enjoyed it. But this was an entirely different situation. "It was just a dream."  
记得不多，" 明日香开始讲述，"我只隐约记得一个令人不安的梦。" 那个梦之前并不令人不安，她甚至还挺享受。但现在情况完全不同了。"那只是个梦。

"Alright. First thing tomorrow, I'm taking you to see Dr. Akagi to have a full checkup to see to the health of you and the baby. We can proceed from there. How far along are you?"  
好的。明天一早，我就带你去见赤木博士，做个全面检查，看看你和宝宝的健康状况。然后我们再做下一步打算。你怀孕多久了？

"Two months," Shinji said. Misato couldn't read his thoughts.  
"两个月，" 真嗣说道。美里无法读懂他的心思。

"Crap, that puts it right around the time of the Christmas party," the Major mused, as a sudden wave of guilt hit her. "If I hadn't had that stupid party…"  
“糟糕，那正好是圣诞派对的时间，”少校沉思着，突然一阵内疚感袭来，“如果不是那个愚蠢的派对……”

"It's not your fault, Misato," Asuka replied as she cast a sympathetic look toward her, "you never knew anything like this would happen!" Shinji wasn't so sure, though. It was after that party that Kaji asked Misato to cut back on her drinking.  
“这不是你的错，美里，”明日香回答道，向她投去同情的目光，“你从不知道会发生这样的事！”但真嗣并不那么确定。正是在那次派对之后，加持要求美里减少饮酒。

"Shinji, if you would," Misato asked as a very large and painful lump formed in her throat, " please dump all the shit in the fridge down the sink. Please?" Misato started to cry now, guilt washing over her and her horrible addiction. "No more…"  
“真嗣，如果你愿意的话，”美里请求道，喉咙里形成了一个巨大而痛苦的肿块，“请把冰箱里所有的东西都倒进水槽。求你了？”美里开始哭泣，内疚感和可怕的瘾头涌上心头，“不再……”

Asuka got up and, doing something that totally would have shocked anyone who knew her, wrapped her arms around Misato and held the older woman and joined her in a good cry. Shinji's heart broke at seeing the two most important women in his life in such pain, and walked over and wrapped them up in an all encompassing embrace.  
明日香站起身来，做了一件完全会让任何认识她的人震惊的事，她张开双臂抱住美里，与年长的女性一起痛哭。看到生命中最重要的两位女性如此痛苦，真嗣的心碎了，他走过去，将她们紧紧拥入怀中。

"_It's time to step up, grow up, and be a man,"_ he thought as he did his best to take the pain away from his family.  
“是时候振作起来，成熟起来，成为一个真正的男人了，”他一边想，一边尽全力减轻家人的痛苦。

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shinji lay on his bed with his hands behind his head, as the music from his SDAT player droned on through his earbuds. Normally, the music would sooth his troubled mind, but tonight was different. Tonight his mind was a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions. Seeing Asuka so heart broken tore him to pieces. The normally strong young woman fell apart, as her carefully constructed walls came tumbling down. He had always cared for the headstrong redhead, but on finding that she was pregnant, something deep and primal awaken inside his heart.  
真嗣躺在床上，双手枕在脑后，SDAT 播放器的音乐通过耳塞持续不断地传入耳中。通常，这音乐能抚慰他烦乱的心绪，但今晚不同。今夜他的思绪和情感如旋风般纷乱。看到明日香如此心碎，他心如刀割。这位平日里坚强无比的年轻女子崩溃了，她精心构筑的壁垒轰然倒塌。他一直关心着这位倔强的红发女孩，但在得知她怀孕后，内心深处某种原始而强烈的情感被唤醒了。

He was hurt and disappointed, at first. He had always dreamed, down in the deepest part of his soul where even he couldn't journey, that he would be the father of Asuka's children. That part shamed him, though. This was not a time to think of his own feelings or needs. This was Asuka's time, and he would do everything possible to help her. His wants and needs be damned.  
起初，他感到受伤和失望。在他灵魂最深处，连他自己都无法触及的地方，他曾梦想过成为明日香孩子的父亲。然而，这部分想法让他感到羞愧。现在不是考虑自己感受或需求的时候。这是明日香的时光，他将竭尽所能帮助她。他的欲望和需求都无关紧要。

The need to help her was overwhelming, one that he could not and would not fight. His heart was ready to tear from his chest as he thought of Asuka just on the other side of the wall, thinking that she would have to go through this all on her own. What was going through her mind right now? Despair? Anger? Loneliness? This line of thinking is what was keeping him up, as the seconds and minutes slowly ticked by with no relief in sight.  
帮助她的需求如此强烈，他无法也不愿与之抗争。想到明日香就在墙的另一边，以为她必须独自面对这一切，他的心几乎要从胸口撕裂。此刻她的脑海中会掠过什么？绝望？愤怒？孤独？这种思绪让他夜不能寐，时间一分一秒地流逝，却不见任何缓解。

Growling in frustration, he tore the buds from his ears and turned over to try to force the sleep to come. It was going to be a very, very busy day tomorrow. He pulled the covers over his shoulders when he heard a light scratching at his door and a small voice call out his name. He leapt out of his bed and opened the door as soon as he could.  
他因沮丧而低吼，扯下耳机翻过身去，试图强迫自己入睡。明天将是异常忙碌的一天。当他听到门上传来轻微的刮擦声和一声细小的呼唤时，他拉起被子盖住肩膀。他立刻从床上跳起，尽快打开了门。

"Shinji," Asuka said softly, as she sniffed back some tears, "can I come in? I can't sleep…"  
“真嗣，”明日香轻声说道，吸了吸鼻子，忍住泪水，“我能进来吗？我睡不着……”

"Sure, Asuka. Anytime," he answered as he stepped aside and let her into his room. She staggered over to his bed and sat down on the edge and started to cry again.  
“当然，明日香。随时都可以，”他回答着，侧身让她进入房间。她踉跄地走到他的床边坐下，又开始哭泣。

"Do you mean it? Anytime?" she asked pleadingly as he walked over toward her and knelt down to the floor in front of her. He looked her in the eyes as best he could in the dim light.  
“你是说真的吗？随时都可以？”她恳求地问道，他朝她走去，跪在她面前的地板上。在昏暗的光线下，他尽可能地注视着她的眼睛。

"Yes, anytime." It truly hurt to see her this upset. He would do anything for her to make her feel better. How any man could take advantage of her like someone had was completely beyond his understanding. It caused an anger to swell within his chest that he had never experienced before. He fought it down so as not to alarm the sad young lady before him.  
“是的，随时都可以。”看到她如此难过，他心里真的很痛。为了让她感觉好些，他愿意做任何事。他完全无法理解，怎么会有男人像某些人那样利用她。这让他胸中涌起前所未有的愤怒，他努力压制住，以免吓到眼前这位悲伤的年轻女士。

"Can…can I sleep here tonight? I don't want to be alone right now."  
“我……我今晚可以睡在这里吗？我现在不想一个人。”

"Sure, not a problem," he said as he moved to get up, "let me get some spare pillows and blankets and I'll bunk out on the floor…"  
“当然，没问题，”他说着准备起身，“我去拿些多余的枕头和毯子，我在地板上睡……”

"No! Please?" she pleaded as she grabbed the front of his shirt to keep him from moving away, "Don't leave me! Hold me, please?" she sobbed.  
“不！请别这样？”她恳求着，抓住他的衬衫前襟，不让他离开，“别离开我！抱抱我，好吗？”她啜泣道。

"Shh, it's okay," Shinji said in a soothing tone as he gently stroked her hair, "I'll never leave you, no matter what."  
“嘘，没事的，”真嗣用安抚的语气说道，轻轻地抚摸着她的头发，“我永远不会离开你，无论发生什么。”

"Will you hold me?" she asked again, trembling.  
“你会抱紧我吗？”她再次颤抖着问道。

_"How anyone could hurt someone so lovely…"_ Shinji thought before he answered, "As you wish," he said with a smile that Asuka could feel in the dark, even if she couldn't see it. He crawled into the bed behind her as she laid down and snuggled up to him in a perfect spooning position. She laid her head down on his arm.  
“怎么会有人忍心伤害如此可爱的人……”真嗣想着，然后回答道：“如你所愿。”他带着一个微笑说道，尽管在黑暗中明日香看不见，但她能感受到。他爬上床，在她身后躺下，两人以完美的搂抱姿势依偎在一起。她把头枕在他的手臂上。

"You're trembling," she said worriedly. "Is everything alright?" She feared his answer.  
"你在发抖，"她担心地说。"一切都好吗？"她害怕听到他的回答。

"I'm fine, just nervous," he lied as he fought the shaking. It was of rage, thinking about what happened to the girl he cared so much about. He fought to control himself.  
"我没事，只是有点紧张，"他撒谎道，努力抑制颤抖。一想到那个他深切关心的女孩所遭遇的事，他就怒不可遏。他努力控制自己。

"You must hate me," Asuka said a few minutes later. Shinji felt the tears pour onto his arm and it tore at him.  
"你一定恨我吧，"几分钟后，明日香说道。真嗣感觉到泪水滴落在他的手臂上，这让他心如刀割。

"I could never hate you, Asuka. I care too much for you to do that," he replied without thinking. She stiffened a bit at his answer.  
"我绝不会恨你，明日香。我太在乎你了，不会那样做的，"他未经思考便回答道。她听到他的回答后，身体微微一僵。

"How could you not? I'm filthy! I'm unclean! I've really screwed things up!" she cried, wracked with sobs. "I'm carrying some scumbag's bastard inside of me!"  
“你怎么能不这样想呢？我太脏了！我不干净！我真的搞砸了！”她哭泣着，声音哽咽。“我肚子里还怀着某个混蛋的野种！”

" Hush," he said gently as he took his arm from his side and wrapped it around her, holding her lower belly with his hand. "You'll upset the baby. It's not her fault."  
“嘘，”他温柔地说道，从身旁抬起手臂，环抱住她，用手掌轻抚她的下腹。“你会吓到宝宝的。这不是她的错。”

His actions and words shocked Asuka. For the first time that day, she thought of the life growing inside of her as a baby. Her baby. His hand was warm on her belly, and a feeling like it belonged there grew within her shattered heart. Then what he said struck her.  
他的举动和话语让明日香震惊。那天里，她第一次将腹中孕育的生命视为一个婴儿，她自己的宝宝。他的手温暖地贴在她的肚子上，一种归属感在她破碎的心中悄然生长。接着，他的话触动了她。

"Her?" she asked, genuinely surprised at what he said. "How can you tell it's a girl? The doctors can't even tell yet!"  
“她？”她问道，对他所说的话感到真正的惊讶。“你怎么知道是女孩？医生都还不能确定呢！”

"Oh, I just have a feeling," Shinji said as he smiled into her hair, "She'll be a little girl, with her mother's red hair, blue eyes, and wild spirit."  
“哦，我就是有种感觉，”真嗣笑着埋进她的发间，“她会是个小女孩，有着她母亲那样的红发、蓝眼睛和狂野的灵魂。”

"Oh really?" she shot back, "And what makes you the great expert? Lots of experience with babies?" Some of her fiery spirit was starting to emerge from the depression of earlier.  
“哦，真的吗？”她反驳道，“你凭什么这么自信？有很多照顾婴儿的经验吗？”她那股火热的灵魂开始从早先的消沉中复苏。

"Not really, but with a mother like the Great Asuka, she wouldn't be any other way!" Asuka chuckled a bit.  
“其实也不算，但有伟大的明日香这样的母亲，她当然不会是别的样子！”明日香轻声笑了起来。

"Thank you, Shinji," she said as she tried to relax. It was a few minutes more before she spoke again, as some of the sniggling doubts came back to haunt her.  
“谢谢你，真嗣，”她努力放松地说。又过了几分钟，她才再次开口，因为那些令人窃笑的疑虑又回来困扰她了。

"Shinji?" 真嗣？

"Yes, Asuka?" 是的，明日香？

"Did you really mean what you said earlier?" came the soft question, in a voice afraid of the answer. "Do you really care for me?"  
你之前说的都是真心的吗？" 她轻声问道，声音中带着对答案的恐惧。"你真的在乎我吗？

"Yes, Asuka, I do. With all my heart." he answered automatically. _"Holy crap! Did I just say that out loud?"_ came the voice of the Coward that hid down in the depths. The Man promptly kicked him square in the face and shoved him back in the shadows. _"I more than care, I love this woman"_  
是的，明日香，我是真心的。" 他本能地回答。"天哪！我刚刚是说出口了吗？" 心底那个懦弱的声音响起。那个男人立刻狠狠地踢了他一脚，把他推回阴影中。"我不仅仅是关心，我爱这个女人。

"Why? I always treated you like crap!"  
为什么？我总是对你很差劲！

"Not always. The past few months have been better. And to answer your question, I just do." he answered her, feeling her body get warmer to the touch.  
"并非总是如此。过去几个月已经好多了。至于你的问题，我就是这么想的。" 他回答她，感觉到她的身体触感变得更温暖。

"And…and you'll never leave me?" once more soft and tinged with fear.  
"而且……你永远不会离开我吗？" 她的声音再次变得柔软，带着一丝恐惧。

"Never. I'll never leave either one of you two," he answered again, as he gently rubbed her belly, causing her to coo a bit. " I may not be this baby's father, but I'll be a father to her if you'll let me."  
永远不会。我永远不会离开你们两个。" 他再次回答，同时轻轻抚摸她的腹部，让她发出一点儿轻柔的声音。"我可能不是这个孩子的亲生父亲，但如果你愿意，我会成为她的父亲。

"What…what do you mean by that?" Asuka gasped, her heart starting to pound like mad. She was shaking like a leaf.  
"你…你这是什么意思？" 明日香倒吸一口气，心跳如鼓，浑身颤抖不已。

"Just what I said, Asuka. Let's just leave it at that. Now, get some sleep, you have a busy day tomorrow," Shinji replied as he drew her closer, making her feel safe and protected.  
"正如我所说，明日香。我们就此打住吧。现在，好好睡一觉，明天你还有忙碌的一天。" 真嗣边说边将她拥得更紧，让她感到安全和被保护。

"Idiot," she yawned as sleep did it's best to claim her.  
"笨蛋。" 她打着哈欠，睡意竭力想要征服她。

"Flattery will get you nowhere," he chuckled as he felt her slowly drift off to the land of dreams. A few minutes later, he followed suit.  
"恭维对你没用。" 他轻笑道，感觉到她渐渐沉入梦乡。几分钟后，他也随之入睡。

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The morning wasn't going really well for anyone. First off, Misato was shocked to find her two charges sleeping in the same bed, but the look Shinji shot her kept her mouth shut.  
早晨对任何人来说都不太顺利。首先，美里震惊地发现她的两个被监护人睡在同一张床上，但真嗣投来的眼神让她闭上了嘴。

"It's not what you think, Misato. She was scared," he added apologetically as he carefully slid out from behind the sleeping girl.  
“不是你想的那样，美里。她害怕了。”他歉意地补充道，小心翼翼地从熟睡的女孩身后滑出来。

"Asuka? Scared? Not likely," Misato said teasingly as Shinji softly closed the door and headed for the kitchen. The tone was completely lost on Shinji.  
“明日香？害怕？不太可能。”美里打趣地说，而真嗣轻轻关上门，朝厨房走去。这种语气完全没被真嗣理解。

"Misato! How can you say that?! After all the shit that just happened to her?!" he growled back. The Major took several steps back and held up her hands up in the air.  
“美里！你怎么能这么说？！经历了那么多事之后？！”他咆哮着回应。美里后退了几步，双手举在空中。

"I'm sorry! I was just teasing!" she said quickly as Shinji's face softened a bit and his shoulders slumped.  
“对不起！我只是开个玩笑！”她急忙说道，看到真嗣的脸色稍稍缓和，肩膀也放松了些。

"I'm sorry, Misato! I shouldn't have snapped at you." he said a bit dejectedly. "I apologize for how I treated you yesterday, it was wrong. It's just…."  
“对不起，美里！我不该对你发脾气的。”他有些沮丧地说，“我为昨天那样对待你道歉，那是不对的。只是……”

"I know, kiddo, I know," she said as she placed her arms around the young man standing before her. To her surprise, Shinji didn't breakdown. He just relaxed a bit as he wrapped his arms around her. _"Being a mom can be nice, sometimes,"_ she mused.  
“我懂的，孩子，我懂，”她说着，张开双臂拥抱站在面前的年轻人。令她意外的是，真嗣并没有崩溃，只是稍微放松了一些，也回抱了她。“有时候，当妈妈的感觉也不错，”她若有所思地说。

"I don't know what to do for her," he said softly.  
“我不知道该为她做些什么。”他轻声说道。

"Just do what you're good at, Shinji. Just be there for her."  
只管做你擅长的事，真嗣。只要在她身边就好。

"I will. I'm not going to run away, ever. I promised them that." Misato looked Shinji in the eye and wondered when he grew up to be the man she now saw him to be.  
"我会的。我不会再逃避了，永远不会。我向他们承诺过。" 美里注视着真嗣的眼睛，心中疑惑他何时成长为了眼前这个男人。

"Shinji?!" cried a startled voice from his room. Shinji quickly extracted himself from Misato's hug and ran to the room.  
"真嗣？！" 房间里传来一声惊呼。真嗣迅速从美里的拥抱中挣脱，跑向房间。

"I'm here, Asuka!" he said as he slid the door open, revealing the terrified girl sitting up in his bed. She was shaking violently.  
"我在这儿，明日香！" 他说着拉开了门，露出坐在他床上、惊恐万状的女孩。她浑身颤抖得厉害。

"Where, where were you?!" she cried out as he went over and took her in his arms.  
“你在哪儿，你在哪儿？”她哭喊着，而他走过去将她拥入怀中。

"It's okay, I just got up to make some breakfast before…arrrrgh!" he said as the redhead suddenly leapt off the bed, throwing him into the floor and running as fast as she could for the bathroom.  
“没事，我只是起床准备做点早餐……啊！”他正说着，红发女孩突然从床上跳下，将他撞倒在地，然后飞快地冲向浴室。

_"It's going to be a long seven months,"_ he thought as he followed her into the bathroom and took care of her as he had the previous day. Misato just looked at the two teenagers and sadly smiled. She had no idea what was in store for these two when the Commander finds out, but she was sure that things would work out.  
“接下来的七个月会很漫长，”他想着，跟着她进了浴室，像前一天那样照顾她。Misato 看着这两个少年，苦涩地笑了笑。她不知道当指挥官发现这一切时会发生什么，但她确信事情总会解决的。

"What do you mean Shinji can't come?" Asuka yelled as she munched on her toast, sending crumbs everywhere.  
“你说什么，真嗣不能来？”Asuka 一边嚼着吐司，一边大声质问，面包屑四散飞溅。

"Shinji needs to head back to school today and take care of things there," Misato replied calmly as she sipped her tea. "He's got to pick up both of your assignments from yesterday, as well as yours for today, Asuka. I also have some paperwork he needs to give the teachers and principle when he's there."  
真嗣今天需要回学校处理一些事情，"美里平静地回答，同时啜饮着她的茶。"他得去取回你们昨天的作业，还有，明日香，今天的作业。我还有一些文件需要他交给老师和校长。

"What?! He's not going to tell everyone about this, is he?!" she screeched and shot Shinji a dirty look. He waved his hands in the air in protest.  
"什么？！他不会是要去告诉所有人这件事吧？！"她尖叫起来，狠狠地瞪了真嗣一眼。他双手在空中挥舞，表示抗议。

"No, I'm not! I'm just going to explain the situation to the administrators and give the paperwork needed. I promise you I won't tell anyone!"  
不，我不会的！我只是去向管理人员说明情况，并递交所需的文件。我保证不会告诉任何人！

"You're not going to go blab to the Stooges, are you?" she asked nervously, expecting a breach in her trust.  
"你不会去跟那些家伙乱说吧？"她紧张地问，担心信任被辜负。

"No, I'm not, Asuka," he replied as he took her hand , "I won't even tell Hikari about it."  
“不，我没有，”他回答着，握住了她的手，“我甚至不会告诉光这件事。”

"Uh, you can tell her, I guess. Just nobody else." she stammered, wondering what her friend would think of her after hearing the news.  
“呃，你可以告诉她，我想。只是别让其他人知道。”她结结巴巴地说，想知道她的朋友听到这个消息后会怎么想她。

"As you wish," he said with a smile as he stood, placed his right fist over his heart and bowed slightly to her. Shinji then turned and went to take his shower before school. Asuka's and Misato's jaws hit the table, as both stared wide-eyed in the direction of the bathroom.  
“如你所愿，”他微笑着说，站起身来，将右手握拳放在心口，微微向她鞠了一躬。真嗣随后转身去洗澡准备上学。明日香和美里目瞪口呆地看着浴室的方向，下巴都快掉到桌子上了。

"He's…changed," Asuka said as she basked in the warm glow that Shinji had left her in. She reached down and rubbed her belly, and smiled.  
“他……变了，”明日香说着，沉浸在真嗣留给她的温暖光芒中。她伸手抚摸着自己的腹部，微笑起来。

"Naw," Misato said as she finished off her tea and thought about a line in one of her favorite books, "The sleeper has awakened!" She grinned at Asuka's obvious confusion and sent her on her way to get dressed.  
“不，”美里说着喝完了她的茶，想起了她最喜欢的一本书里的一句话，“沉睡者已经醒来！”她对着明日香明显的困惑咧嘴一笑，打发她去换衣服。

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Hey, Shinji!" a voice called out to him as he got of his motorcycle and removed his helmet and leather jacket. Shinji looked up to see his friend, Touji Suzahara, limping over to him. "You rode the bike to school today? Sweet!"  
“嘿，真嗣！”他刚从摩托车上下来，摘下头盔和皮夹克，就听到有人喊他。真嗣抬头一看，是他的朋友铃原东治一瘸一拐地向他走来。“你今天骑摩托车来学校的？酷！”

"Aw, he just did that to get the chicks! Right, Shinji?" asked his other friend, Kensuke Aida, who was getting lots of footage of Shinji's bike with his new digital camera that his father had given him for Christmas.  
“啊，他这么做只是为了泡妞！对吧，真嗣？”他的另一位朋友相田剑介问道，他正用他父亲圣诞节送给他的新数码相机给真嗣的摩托车拍了很多照片。

"Speaking of chicks, where's the Red Headed Devil? You two newlyweds have a spat or something?" Touji teased as slapped Shinji on the shoulder. Shinji turned and shot him a look that could shatter the armour plating off of every EVA ever constructed.  
“说到妞，红发魔女去哪儿了？你们这对新婚夫妇吵架了吗？”东治调侃着拍了拍真嗣的肩膀。真嗣转过身来，给了他一个能击碎所有 EVA 装甲板的眼神。

"Don't ever call her that again." he seethed, causing his friends to take a few steps back.  
“再也不要那样叫她了。”他咬牙切齿地说，让朋友们不由自主地后退了几步。

"Whoa, dude! Chill!" Touji protested, "Just kidding, man! What's wrong?" Kensuke was filming the whole incident until Shinji turned and looked like he was ready to shove the camera up Kensuke's ass. The camera was quickly put away.  
“哇，伙计！冷静点！” 东治抗议道，“开个玩笑而已，怎么了？” 真嗣一直在拍摄整个事件，直到真希波转身，看起来准备把摄像机塞进真嗣的屁股里。摄像机很快就被收起来了。

"Sorry guys, I'm just tired and a little worried. Asuka's not feeling very well right now. Misato took her to see Dr. Akagi for some tests." Shinji apologized to his friends. "I came to get our assignments from yesterday and let the teachers know what's going on."  
“对不起，伙计们，我只是累了，有点担心。明日香现在感觉不太好。美里带她去找赤木博士做些检查。”真希波向朋友们道歉，“我来取昨天的作业，并告诉老师们发生了什么事。”

"And what is going on?" Kensuke asked, his instincts for trouble were serving him well.  
“到底发生了什么？”真嗣问道，他对麻烦的直觉一向很准。

"Just like I said, Asuka's not feeling well," Shinji said with a tone that warned his friend to drop the whole conversation.  
“就像我说的，明日香身体不舒服，” 真嗣用一种警告朋友别再提这事的语气说道。

"Eh, it's probably that time of the month," Touji added as Shinji slugged him in the fake arm as they walked to class.  
“哎，可能就是那几天吧，” 冬二补充道，结果被真嗣在假肢上捶了一拳，他们正走向教室。

_"No, we're not going to have to worry about that in the near future,"_ Shinji thought as they entered the classroom and took their seats. Opening his computer, he quickly typed a message to Hikari and awaited her answer.  
“不，我们近期不必担心那个，” 真嗣边想边走进教室坐下。他打开电脑，迅速给光发了一条消息，然后等待她的回复。

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Hi Shinji," Hikari called out as she headed for the tree where she and Asuka liked to eat lunch often. "You're not eating today?"  
“嗨，真嗣，” 光喊道，她朝她和明日香常去吃午饭的那棵树走去。“你今天不吃吗？”

"Hi Hikari," he answered back, "not today, I'm not very hungry, and I don't plan on being here for too much longer today. I still need to deliver some paperwork to the principle and then go…"  
嗨，Hikari，" 他回答道，"今天不行，我不太饿，而且我也不打算在这里待太久。我还需要把一些文件交给校长，然后就走……

"See to Asuka?" Hikari smiled as she finished Shinji's sentence. He just sat and smirked, his eyes twinkling just a bit. Hikari thought it was cute.  
"去看 Asuka 吗？" Hikari 笑着接完了 Shinji 的话。他只是坐着，微微一笑，眼中闪烁着一丝光芒。Hikari 觉得这很可爱。

"That obvious?" he said wryly and shook his head. The young lady next to him just giggled.  
"有这么明显吗？" 他苦笑着摇了摇头。坐在他旁边的年轻女士只是咯咯地笑。

"You've had it bad for that girl since the day she first showed up here. Besides, you both were gone yesterday, and she's not here today. That means she's not feeling good. How's she doing? It's not serious, I hope!" the pig tailed class rep asked, somewhat worried.  
"自从她第一天来这里，你就对她情有独钟。而且，你们俩昨天都不在，今天她也没来。这意味着她身体不舒服。她怎么样了？希望不是什么严重的事！" 这位扎着马尾的班长有些担忧地问道。

_"About as serious as it can get,"_ he thought glumly as he turned to face his friend. "Hikari, I have something to tell you, but before I do, you have to promise me something."  
“严重到不能再严重了。”他沮丧地想着，转身面对他的朋友，“光，我有件事要告诉你，但在我说之前，你得答应我一件事。”

"_Not good,"_ Hikari thought to herself. "What do you want me to promise?"  
“不太妙啊。”光心想，“你要我答应什么？”

"That you will promise to hear me out. That you don't go flying off the handle. That you won't judge things or jump to conclusions. That you'll still be there for Asuka. Most importantly, that you will not tell anyone, even Touji. Can you promise me that?" Shinji asked, his face a mask of stone, but his eyes pleading for Hikari to understand.  
“你要答应听我说完，不要冲动，不要妄下判断或急于下结论。你要继续支持明日香。最重要的是，你不能告诉任何人，包括冬二。你能答应我吗？”真嗣问道，他的脸像石头一样僵硬，但眼神恳求光理解。

"_Definitely not good at all,"_ she mused. "I promise, Shinji."  
“确实很不妙。”她暗自思忖，“我答应你，真嗣。”

"Thank you, Hikari," he replied, and felt as if a huge weight was off of his shoulders, _"One weight down, eight hundred to go,"_. Sighing, he sat there for a minute or so, trying to gather his thoughts and figure out the best way to break the news.  
“谢谢你，Hikari，”他回答道，感觉肩上的重担似乎减轻了许多，“一个重担卸下了，还有八百个等着呢。”他叹了口气，坐在那里大约一分钟，试图整理思绪，找出最好的方式来传达这个消息。

"What did you want to say…" Hikari asked gently, before Shinji cut her off.  
“你想说什么…”Hikari 温柔地问道，但被 Shinji 打断了。

"Asuka's pregnant," came his reply, not knowing of any other way to soften the blow. Hikari's face went pale as her jaw dropped, eyes wide as saucers. Shinji reached over and took her hand, not in a romantic way, but as a friend trying to comfort another. "She's going to need you, Hikari. She's going to need her friends, more than ever."  
“Asuka 怀孕了，”他回答道，不知道还有什么办法能缓和这个打击。Hikari 的脸色变得苍白，下巴掉了下来，眼睛瞪得像铜铃一样大。Shinji 伸出手握住她的手，不是以浪漫的方式，而是作为朋友试图安慰另一个朋友。“她会需要你的，Hikari。她会比以往任何时候都更需要她的朋友们。”

"But…but…but how? Who? Not you…" she stammered, shocked completely beyond the ability to comprehend. Shinji's eyes wore a sadness that broke Hikari's heart.  
“但是…但是…怎么会？谁？不是你…”她结结巴巴地说，完全震惊到无法理解。Shinji 眼中流露出的悲伤让 Hikari 心碎。

"You promised not to jump to conclusions," he said, not harshly. "No, I'm not the father. I wish…" he said with such sorrow that Hikari wanted to weep for him, before the emotions were clamped back down and he picked up his burden once more. He told her the story the best he could, everything that they had been able to figure out. He even told her of how he promised to be there for her and the baby, and how he would never leave.  
“你答应过不妄下结论的，”他说，语气并不严厉。“不，我不是父亲。我真希望……”他的悲伤如此深切，光子几乎要为他哭泣，但情感随即被压抑，他再次挑起了重担。他尽可能地向她讲述了整个故事，包括他们所能推断出的一切。他甚至告诉她，他承诺会陪在她和孩子身边，永远不会离开。

"So, what is she going to do? What are you going to do, Shinji?" Hikari asked, blushing slightly when she thought about the responsibility the sixteen year old man had just accepted, and wondering how many others would do the same thing.  
“那么，她打算怎么办？你又打算怎么办，真嗣？”光子问道，想到这个十六岁的男孩刚刚承担起的责任，她的脸颊微微泛红，并好奇还有多少人会做出同样的选择。

"I don't know yet, Hikari, but I have a few ideas," he said as he stood and extended his hand to help his friend up from her seat. Hikari reached over and gave him a big hug before he could leave.  
“我还不知道，光子，但我有几个想法，”他说着站起身，伸出手帮助他的朋友从座位上站起来。光子在他离开前伸出手，给了他一个大大的拥抱。

"That was for Asuka, make sure to give it to her," she told the blushing teen, " and this one is for you," she continued as she gave him a small peck on the cheek. He touched his cheek lightly, puzzled.  
“这个拥抱是给明日香的，记得转交给她，”她告诉脸红的少年，“而这个吻是给你的，”她继续说着，在他脸颊上轻轻一吻。他轻触脸颊，有些困惑。

"Why?" he inquired, somewhat perplexed.  
“为什么？”他有些困惑地问道。

"For being such a nice guy! Asuka's lucky to have you!" she smiled shyly as she looked in his dark blue eyes. "Just don't tell Touji what I did, okay?"  
“因为你是这么好的一个人！明日香有你真是幸运！”她羞涩地微笑着，凝视着他深蓝色的眼睛，“只是别告诉东治我做的事，好吗？”

"What, and risk getting myself pummel to death twice over? No thanks!" he grinned as his friend giggled at his reply. She watched him as he shook his head a bit and walked back toward the school.  
“什么，还要冒着被揍得半死两次的风险？谢了，我可不干！”他笑着说，朋友被他的回答逗得咯咯笑。她看着他轻轻摇了摇头，转身向学校走去。

"Shinji! Let Asuka know I'll call her tonight!" she called out as he raised his arm over his head and waved his acknowledgement back at her. She sighed as she thought about how nice of a guy Shinji Ikari really was.  
“真嗣！告诉明日香我今晚给她打电话！”她喊道，他举起手臂在头顶挥了挥，示意听到了。她叹了口气，心想碇真嗣这个家伙真是太好了。

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After dropping off the paperwork with the school administrators, Shinji mounted his motorcycle and rode to NERV headquarters. He had a lot of time to think as he rode the monorail through the GeoFront. This line of thinking was scaring the hell out of him, but The Man inside of him kept beating the snot out of The Coward and sending him packing. He came up with a plan of action that he hope would take care of as many things as possible. Three things in this plan worried him the most, but he had a family to take of.  
在将文件交给学校行政人员后，真嗣骑上摩托车前往 NERV 总部。在乘坐单轨列车穿越 GeoFront 的过程中，他有大量时间思考。这种思考让他感到极度恐惧，但内心的“男人”不断击败“懦夫”，将他赶走。他制定了一个行动计划，希望能尽可能多地解决问题。这个计划中有三件事最让他担忧，但他还有家人需要照顾。

He reached the doors of the medical section when he heard a blood curdling scream, followed by a long stream of German words that he had learned from painful experience would make a sailor blush. Several other voices could be heard within, but what got him to moving was the next words the young German spoke.  
当他到达医疗部门门口时，听到了一声令人毛骨悚然的尖叫，紧接着是一连串德语，这些话他曾痛苦地学到足以让水手脸红。里面还能听到其他几个声音，但让他行动起来的是那个年轻的德国人接下来的话。

"NO! I won't let you hurt my baby!!" Asuka's scream caused Shinji to see red. He bolted for the door as a large male orderly did his best to block his way.  
“不！我不会让你伤害我的孩子！！”明日香的尖叫让真嗣怒火中烧。他冲向门口，一个高大的男护理人员尽力阻挡他的去路。

"Sorry, sir, but you can't…urk!" was all he got out as Shinji hit him in a place where no man should be struck, then quickly came up with a knee to the man's nose, all within the space of half a second. Shinji burst into the room, seeing a terrified Asuka huddled in a corner as Doctor Akagi and several others were closing in on her.  
“对不起，先生，但你不能……呃！”他只来得及说出这些，就被真嗣击中了一个不该被击中的部位，紧接着真嗣迅速用膝盖顶向他的鼻子，这一切都在半秒内完成。真嗣冲进房间，看到惊恐的明日香蜷缩在角落里，而赤木律子博士和其他几个人正向她逼近。

"Shinji! Help me! They want to kill our baby!!" she screamed as he ran into the room and slid between Asuka and the others. Shinji never had much fighting experience outside of an EVA, but those instincts took over as he dropped into a fighting stance, eyes filled with fire, and ready to go into a berserker mode that would put EVA Unit One to shame.  
“真嗣！救我！他们想杀我们的孩子！！”她尖叫着，当他跑进房间并滑到明日香和其他人之间时。真嗣除了驾驶 EVA 外，并没有太多战斗经验，但那些本能立刻接管了他，他摆出战斗姿势，眼中充满怒火，准备进入一种会让 EVA 初号机都相形见绌的狂暴模式。

"Back off!" he called out, his voice filled with venom and the promise of extreme pain to any who did not comply.  
“退后！”他喊道，声音中充满了毒辣和给不遵守者的极端痛苦承诺。

"Get out of the way, Shinji! This must be done!" Doctor Akagi said as she held a syringe before her, motioning to the others in the room to remove Shinji. That was a mistake, as their dental bills just went up drastically. It was a good thing they were in the medical wing.  
“让开，真嗣！这必须完成！”赤木律子博士说着，手里拿着一支注射器，示意房间里的其他人把真嗣拉开。这是个错误，因为他们的牙科账单刚刚大幅上涨。幸好他们在医疗翼。

"I said to get back!" he barked, turning his eyes toward her, the only adult remaining standing in the room. Doctor Akagi was truly afraid for the first time in her life.  
“我说了，退后！”他咆哮着，目光转向她，房间里唯一还站着的成年人。赤木律子医生真的害怕了，这是她人生中的第一次。

"What the HELL is going on here?!" demand Misato as she stormed into the room, followed by Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki and Maya Ibuki. The state of the room shocked everyone, as all eyes turned on Shinji and Asuka.  
“这里到底发生了什么鬼事？！”美里冲进房间，身后跟着副司令官冬月和伊吹玛亚。房间的状况让所有人都震惊了，大家的目光都转向了真嗣和明日香。

"She wants to kill our baby!!" Asuka screamed, as she continued to hide behind Shinji. If he wasn't in fighting mode, those words would have filled him with pride: _our baby!_  
“她想杀了我们的孩子！！”明日香尖叫着，继续躲在真嗣身后。如果不是处于战斗状态，这些话本会让他充满自豪：我们的孩子！

"No one is to touch her!" Shinji growled. The Sub-Commander raised one eyebrow in surprise. Misato's jaw dropped at what she had just heard.  
“谁也不许碰她！”真嗣咆哮道。副司令官挑起了一边的眉毛，显得有些惊讶。美里听到这话，下巴都快掉下来了。

"Ritsuko?" she asked, shocked at what she had just heard.  
“理津子？”她问道，震惊于刚刚听到的消息。

"What?! It's the _only_ viable option here! She can't pilot an EVA in this condition! There is no telling what this would do to her sync ratios, or what it will do to the fetus! The EVA's are our main concern. Everything else doesn't matter!" The blonde scientist argued as she turned to look at the others.  
“什么？！这是唯一可行的选择！她这种状态无法驾驶 EVA！谁也不知道这会对她的同步率造成什么影响，或者对胎儿有什么后果！EVA 是我们首要考虑的。其他的一切都不重要！”金发科学家争论着，转向其他人。

SLAP!! 啪！！

Everyone stood there in shock as Maya stood above her supervisor, her hand still in the air from the blow she struck Doctor Akagi. Ritsuko slowly got up from the floor, holding her cheek, which was turning redder by the second. Maya continued to stand there in a rage.  
所有人都震惊地站在那里，真耶站在她的上司上方，手还停留在空中，那是她刚刚扇了赤木博士一巴掌。理津子慢慢地从地板上站起来，捂着越来越红的脸颊。真耶继续站在那里，怒气未消。

"Doctor Akagi! How dare you! That is her choice, not yours!" she said, tears in her eyes as she trembled with rage. Misato stepped forward and pulled Maya over to the side and then got very close to Akagi.  
“赤城医生！你怎么敢！那是她的选择，不是你的！”她眼中含泪，因愤怒而颤抖着说道。美里走上前，把真嗣拉到一旁，然后逼近赤城。

"Does the Commander know about all this?" she whispered through her teeth, enough anger in her voice to cause Akagi to step back.  
“指挥官知道这一切吗？”她咬牙切齿地低声问道，语气中的愤怒足以让赤城后退。

"He knows about the pregnancy," she said quietly.  
“他知道怀孕的事，”她平静地说。

"Does he know about your pre-emptive solution?" Fuyutsuki asked her, his eyes cold as he regarded the doctor.  
“他知道你的先发制人方案吗？”冬月问她，目光冰冷地注视着医生。

"Uh, not yet, but I know that he would agree with my assessment!" she spat back.  
“呃，还没有，但我知道他会同意我的评估！”她反驳道。

"So, you took it upon yourself to cause emotional and physical harm to an EVA pilot, with no orders from the chain of command?" Fuyutsuki added, "Do you like causing harm to children?" That question left Doctor Akagi speechless.  
“那么，你是擅自对一名 EVA 驾驶员造成情感和身体伤害，没有任何来自指挥链的命令吗？” 富士津树补充道，“你喜欢伤害孩子吗？”这个问题让赤木律子医生哑口无言。

"But, what about the EVA's?" Akagi asked, trying to get someone to see her point of view. She would just have to do her best to convince the Commander later.  
“但是，EVA 怎么办？” 律子问道，试图让某人理解她的观点。她只能尽力稍后说服指挥官。

"Fuck them!" came back a cold voice from the corner. It sounded a little too much like the Commander for anyone's taste. Same intonations, different emotions.  
“去他的！”角落里传来一个冷酷的声音。听起来有点太像指挥官了，让人不舒服。同样的语调，不同的情感。

"Shinji," Misato said as she walked toward the couple, "why don't you take Asuka to go get dressed and take her back home. I'll be there later."  
真嗣，"美里一边说着一边向这对情侣走去，"你为什么不带明日香去换衣服，然后送她回家。我晚点会过去。

"Are you sure, Misato?" Shinji said guardedly, "I won't let anything happen to Asuka and the baby."  
你确定吗，美里？"真嗣谨慎地说，"我不会让任何事情发生在明日香和宝宝身上。

"Yes, I'm sure," she replied, as she reached around him and pulled the redhead to her feet, "Nothing is going to happen. I promise." She and Shinji swapped keys.  
"是的，我确定，"她回答道，同时绕到他身后将红发女孩拉起来，"什么都不会发生。我保证。"她和真嗣交换了钥匙。

"Don't make promises you can't keep, Major," Akagi said viciously as Shinji lead Asuka from the room.  
"别许下你无法兑现的承诺，少校，"律子恶狠狠地说，此时真嗣正领着明日香离开房间。

"She can't, I can," Fuyutsuki said as he and the others left the room, leaving Akagi in there alone, fuming about teenagers and damn hormones.  
"她不行，我可以，"冬月说道，他和众人离开了房间，留下赤木独自在里面生闷气，对青少年的情绪和该死的荷尔蒙感到恼火。

"Shinji?" Asuka called out from behind the curtain that separated the male and female portions of the locker room. There was fear and worry in her voice. The shell that she had so carefully created over all those years was gone, leaving only the scared little girl behind.  
"真嗣？"明日香从更衣室男女分区的帘子后面喊道，她的声音里充满了恐惧和担忧。多年来她精心构建的外壳已经消失，只剩下那个害怕的小女孩。

"What's up, Asuka?" he asked patiently as he waited for her to change from her hospital gown.  
"怎么了，明日香？"他耐心地问道，等待她从病号服换好衣服。

"You're not peeking are you?" she called back out, having lost her nerve to ask what was really on her mind. Some off the false bravado came back to her voice. " I bet you are, you perv!" She heard something she wasn't expecting: Shinji was laughing!  
"你没偷看吧？"她回喊道，失去了勇气去问真正困扰她的问题。一些虚假的勇敢回到了她的声音中。"我敢打赌你肯定在偷看，你这个变态！"她听到了意想不到的事情：真嗣在笑！

"No, I'm not peeking," he called back, still laughing. "The way you dress at home sometimes, why should I have to peak? Ain't much left to the imagination!" Asuka gasped at this, shocked he would say such a thing.  
“不，我没有偷看，”他笑着回喊道，“你在家有时穿的那样子，我还需要偷看吗？没什么可想象的了！”这话让明日香倒吸一口凉气，震惊于他竟会说出这样的话。

She grabbed the curtain and pulled it open, getting ready to give the young smart mouth a good tongue-lashing. Instead, she froze as he stood before her, a silly grin on his face and a single red rose held out to her. Her heart melted.  
她抓住窗帘猛地拉开，准备好好教训一下这个嘴欠的小子。然而，当她看到他站在面前，脸上挂着傻笑，手里拿着一朵红玫瑰时，她的心瞬间融化了。

"What? One instead of a dozen? What kind of cheapskate are you?" she smirked at the momentary look of confusion on his face, before he grinned and went back at her.  
“什么？一朵而不是一打？你这人有多抠门啊？”她看着他脸上短暂的困惑表情，然后他笑了笑，继续回击。

"Well, what do you expect? You ever tried carrying a dozen roses and riding a bike at the same time? I still have thorns in my teeth just from the one!" he shot back, with the same silly grin on his face. Asuka stood there for a second before the thought of Shinji riding through the streets of Tokyo-3 with a rose between his teeth got to her. She started giggling, then laughing uncontrollably. It was infectious, as Shinji joined her a second later.  
“那你期望什么呢？你试过同时拿着一打玫瑰和骑自行车吗？就这一朵，我嘴里还有刺呢！”他回嘴道，脸上依旧是那副傻笑。明日香愣了一会儿，想到真嗣在东京-3 的街道上骑车，嘴里叼着一朵玫瑰的情景，忍不住开始咯咯笑起来，然后笑得无法自控。这笑声很有感染力，真嗣也很快加入了她的行列。

"Thank you," she said sweetly as she took the rose from his hand and held it close. She had been given flowers before by others, in great bunches and by the dozens. This one single rose meant more to her right now than any of those ever had. She knew this one was from the heart. _"And what a lovely heart it is,"_ she thought to herself as she took Shinji's hand and lead him from the locker room.  
“谢谢你，”她甜甜地说道，从他手中接过玫瑰，紧紧地握在胸前。她曾收到过别人送的花，一束束，一打打。但此刻这一朵玫瑰对她来说，比以往任何一次都更有意义。她知道这朵花是发自内心的。“多么美丽的心啊，”她心中暗想，牵起真嗣的手，领着他离开了更衣室。

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The night at home went so much smoother than the night before. Shinji made some Asuka's favorite foods for dinner, after they made a trip to the nearest western food store, and was serving it up when Misato finally made it home for the evening.  
那晚在家中的时光比前一晚顺畅多了。真嗣做了明日香最喜欢的菜肴，他们一起去最近的西式食品店采购后，他就开始准备晚餐，直到美里终于在傍晚时分回到家中。

"How did the tests go, Misato?" Shinji asked as they all sat down to supper. Misato cradled her cup of tea in her hands, wishing deep down that it was a beer.  
“测试进行得怎么样，美里？”真嗣问道，他们一起坐下来吃晚饭。美里双手捧着茶杯，内心深处却渴望那是一杯啤酒。

"All the tests came back good. Asuka and the baby are in perfect health," Misato said happily as she flashed her best smile at her charges.  
“所有检查结果都很好。明日香和宝宝都非常健康。”美里开心地说道，向她的孩子们展露了她最灿烂的笑容。

"No thanks to that bitch," Asuka mumbled as she took another bite of sauerkraut.  
"不感谢那个婊子，" 明日香嘟囔着，又咬了一口酸菜。

"We had a long discussion about that, the four of us," the violet haired woman said as she bit into her bratwurst which had been covered in curry powder.  
"我们四个人进行了长时间的讨论，" 紫发女子说道，同时咬了一口裹满咖喱粉的布拉特香肠。

"Four of you?" Shinji asked, not liking where this was going.  
"四个人？" 真嗣问道，不喜欢事情的发展方向。

"Yes. Myself, Doctor Akagi, Commander Fuyutsuki, and Commander Ikari."  
是的。我、赤木律子博士、副司令官冬月和司令官碇源堂。

"Uh oh," both teenagers said in stereo.  
"哎呀，"两个少年异口同声地说道。

"Actually, it wasn't that bad. Doctor Akagi did her best to get your father to order the pregnancy's termination, but your father denied that request. However," a dark shadow crossed over her face, "he hasn't decided what to do about Asuka. Not to scare either of you, but he could just as easily order her back to Germany."  
其实，情况没那么糟。赤木博士尽了最大努力说服你父亲下令终止妊娠，但你父亲拒绝了这一请求。然而，"她的脸上掠过一片阴影，"他还没决定怎么处理明日香。不是要吓唬你们，但他可能会轻易下令让她回德国。

"What did Commander Fuyutsuki have to say?" Shinji wondered as he tore into his roll.  
"副司令冬月有什么建议吗？"真嗣边撕开面包边问。

"Well, he recommended combat training for the orderlies, as well as hazard pay for having to work with a bunch of pissed off pilots, and a better dental plan," Misato grinned as she told them this. Food shot from one end of the table to the other as both children started to laugh uncontrollably.  
"嗯，他建议给护理人员进行战斗训练，还有因为要和一群愤怒的驾驶员共事而增加危险津贴，以及更好的牙科保险，"美里笑着告诉他们。食物从桌子的一头飞到另一头，两个孩子开始不可抑制地大笑起来。

"Misato, you've got to be joking! Fuyutsuki would never say anything like that!" Asuka finally managed to say after catching her breath.  
"美里，你一定是在开玩笑吧！冬月副司令绝不会说那种话的！" 明日香终于喘过气来，说道。

"On my honor as an officer, he said it word for word!" she grinned as she cast a look toward Shinji, who was now trying his best not to blush. "He also said he was proud of you, Shinji, for standing up for Asuka. Your mother would be proud!" Shinji's blush increased tenfold as he did his best to melt under the table. He wasn't used to praise at all, though he used to yearned for it. All he wanted to do now was make Asuka happy.  
"我以军官的荣誉担保，他一字不差地说了！" 她笑着朝真嗣瞥了一眼，真嗣正努力不让自己脸红。"他还说，他为你感到骄傲，真嗣，因为你为明日香挺身而出。你母亲也会为你感到骄傲的！" 真嗣的脸红得更加厉害，他尽力让自己在桌子下消失。他不习惯被表扬，尽管他曾经渴望得到表扬。现在他只想让明日香开心。

"Shinji, my hero!" Asuka said in a most over-the-top way, exaggerating every syllable, as a genuine smile caresses her face. She reached over and patted his hand as Misato smiled. Shinji kept silent, but a small smile did display itself on his ever reddening face.  
"真嗣，我的英雄！" 明日香用极其夸张的语调说道，每个音节都拖得长长的，脸上洋溢着真诚的笑容。她伸手拍了拍他的手，美里也笑了。真嗣保持沉默，但他那张越来越红的脸上确实露出了一丝微笑。

Later on, after dinner and dishes, Shinji sat on the sofa and was deep in thought. Hikari had kept her word and call Asuka, which picked up the redhead's spirits more than could be expressed. This made Shinji happy, but he still had plans to work out, and was at a bit of a loss at what should be done to implement them. He needed someone to talk to, badly. His answer came into the door, much to the squeal of a certain Major.  
晚饭后，洗完碗碟，真嗣坐在沙发上陷入沉思。光遵守了诺言，给明日香打了电话，这让红发少女的精神振奋到了无法言表的程度。这让真嗣感到高兴，但他仍有计划需要制定，对于如何实施这些计划感到有些迷茫。他迫切需要有人倾诉。这时，门铃响起，一位少校的尖叫声随之而来。

"Kaji! What are you doing here this time of night, you naughty boy? Hmmm?" Misato cooed as she fell all over the tall NERV agent. She had given up the pretense of disliking him months ago, it was so much easier that way.  
“加持！这么晚了你来这里做什么，你这个坏小子？嗯？”美里娇嗔着扑向高大的 NERV 特工。几个月前，她已经放弃了假装不喜欢他的伪装，这样轻松多了。

"Ah, my lovely Major," Kaji said in his own, semi-suave way, "as much as I would love to say it was the thought of your shapely legs and lovely bosom that brought me here tonight, that would be a lie, though a great side benefit. I actually came here to talk to someone else, at their request." He nodded his head in the direction of the couch. Misato gave him a look of confusion, but understanding dawned on her. Man-to-man type of talk, kind of hard to do with a house full of females.  
“啊，我美丽的少校，”加持以他那半吊子的潇洒方式说道，“尽管我很想说是因为思念你那迷人的双腿和美丽的胸部才在今晚来到这里，但那是个谎言，虽然是个极好的附带好处。实际上，我是应某人的请求来这里找他谈谈的。”他向沙发方向点了点头。美里一脸困惑，但随即恍然大悟。男人之间的谈话，家里全是女性确实不太方便。

"Hey kiddo, what's up?" Kaji said as he vaulted over the couch and plopped down at the other end.  
"嘿，小家伙，最近怎么样？" 卡吉说着，从沙发上翻越过去，一屁股坐在另一头。

"Hey, Kaji! Thanks for coming!" Shinji greeted, "What some tea?" he asked as he started to get up, but he waved him off.  
"嘿，卡吉！谢谢你来！" 真嗣打招呼道，"来点茶吗？" 他边说边准备起身，但卡吉摆手示意不用。

"Sounds good, but let's allow your roommate get it for us, why don't we?," Kaji said as he waved to the love of his life who was standing in the kitchen, eavesdropping.  
"听起来不错，不过让室友帮我们拿吧，怎么样？" 卡吉说着，向站在厨房、偷听他们谈话的挚爱挥了挥手。

"Kaji, her tea isn't much better than her cooking," Shinji warned.  
"卡吉，她的茶可不比她的厨艺好多少，" 真嗣提醒道。

"I'll risk it, I can always put a bullet in my head later if the pain proves too unbearable," he grinned as he heard the dishes in the kitchen scatter as she heard what he said. He and Shinji shared a chuckle.  
“我会冒险一试，如果痛苦实在难以忍受，我总可以稍后给自己一枪，”他咧嘴笑着，听到厨房里的碗碟因她听到他的话而散落一地。他和真嗣相视而笑。

"Yeah, but what about me?" asked the teenager, loud enough for her to hear.  
“那我呢？”少年大声问道，足以让她听见。

"You still got that cyanide pill I gave you for just such an emergency?" Kaji replied, waiting for a reaction.  
“我给你的氰化物药丸还在吗？就是为了这种紧急情况准备的。”加持回答道，等待着她的反应。

"I can hear you both, you know!" a stern voice called back from the kitchen.  
“我可都听见了，你们两个！”厨房里传来一个严厉的声音。

"We know," they called back in unison as they kept laughing. They both knew that as much as Misato loved to tease, she _hated_ being teased herself. "We love you Misato!" Misato just growled back in response as she brought them their tea.  
“我们知道，”他们齐声回应，笑声依旧。两人都清楚，美里虽然喜欢逗弄别人，却最讨厌被逗弄。“我们爱你，美里！”美里只是低吼一声作为回应，然后给他们端上了茶。

"Well, I'll just retreat back to my little room so you big men can have your big talk," she said sarcastically as she brought them their tea. Shinji thanked her as Kaji blew her a kiss.  
“好吧，我这就回我的小房间去，好让你们这些大男人能畅谈一番，”她带着讽刺的口吻说道，同时给他们端上了茶。真嗣向她道谢，而加持则向她飞吻。

"So, what's up? " Kaji said, prodding the young man beside him to open up. Kaji was one of the few people Shinji had ever opened up to in the past, and that bond remain. Shinji found it so easy to talk to the older man, like he was an older brother.  
“那么，有什么事吗？”加持说道，催促着坐在他身边的年轻人开口。加持是少数几个真嗣曾敞开心扉的人之一，这份羁绊依然存在。真嗣发现与这位年长者交谈异常轻松，仿佛他是一位兄长。

"Well, have you heard what happened?" Shinji started off, not knowing what all the agent had heard through his sources. Seeing how Misato was his betrothed, he knew secrets didn't stay that way for long.  
“那么，你听说了吗？”真嗣开口问道，不知道这位特工通过他的渠道听到了多少。考虑到美里是他的未婚妻，他知道秘密不会长久保持。

"About Asuka? Or about you going ape-shit on the medical staff at headquarters?"  
关于明日香？还是关于你在总部对医务人员发疯的事？

"Uh, about Asuka," Shinji quickly added, trying to gloss over what happened earlier today.  
"呃，关于明日香，" 真嗣迅速补充道，试图掩盖今天早些时候发生的事情。

"Yes, I heard," Kaji said sadly, thinking about his former charge and her dire situation, "it's very sad. Is there something you wish to tell me?" he asked gently.  
"是的，我听说了，" 加持悲伤地说，想着他曾经的监护对象和她糟糕的处境，"非常令人难过。你有什么想告诉我的吗？" 他温柔地问道。

"It's not that, Kaji. I'm not the father," Shinji couldn't hide the sadness in his voice.  
"不是那样的，加持。我不是父亲，" 真嗣无法掩饰声音中的悲伤。

"That upsets you, doesn't it?" Kaji asked, knowing how Shinji felt about Asuka. He was studying the young man very closely, trying to catch a glimpse into the inner workings of his mind.  
"那让你很困扰，不是吗？" 加持问道，他了解真嗣对明日香的感情。他仔细观察着这个年轻人，试图窥探他内心的想法。

"That doesn't matter," Shinji replied, "What matters is that Asuka and the baby are taken care of, and that they are protected. I never want to see them hurt. I swore to Asuka I'd protect them both."  
那不重要，" 真嗣回答，"重要的是明日香和宝宝得到照顾，并受到保护。我永远不想看到他们受伤。我向明日香发誓，我会保护他们俩。

Kaji's eyes widened a bit as he thought about what Shinji had just said. _"Was Shinji aware at what he just said, and the implications of it?"_ Kaji thought as his respect for the young man grew in leaps and bounds. "So, where do I come in?"  
加持的眼睛微微睁大，思考着真嗣刚刚说的话。"真嗣是否意识到他刚才的话及其含义？" 加持想道，他对这个年轻人的敬意大增。"那么，我在这里的角色是什么？"

"I need your help, Kaji," the younger man said, as he looked the older man square in the eye. Kaji was taken aback at how like his father Shinji looked just now, same intensity in the eyes, but guided by love rather than greed and power. "Here is what I need to do…" Shinji said as he laid out his plans to Kaji, and asked him for help in the areas he wasn't quite sure of. When Shinji was finished, Kaji sat back and let out a long breath.  
"我需要你的帮助，加持，" 年轻人说，他直视着年长者的眼睛。加持被真嗣此刻与他父亲相似的神情所震惊，眼中有着同样的专注，但这是出于爱而非贪婪和权力。"我需要做的是……" 真嗣说着，向加持详细阐述了他的计划，并请求他在自己不太确定的地方给予帮助。真嗣说完后，加持向后靠了靠，长长地舒了一口气。

"Damn, Shinji, you could give your old man a run for his money," Kaji replied as he thought about what all Shinji had just told him. The young man shot him a look that would kill, if Kaji wasn't wearing his bullet-proof vest.  
“该死，真嗣，你简直能跟你老爸一较高下，”加持回答道，心中想着真嗣刚刚告诉他的所有事情。年轻人投来一个足以致命的眼神，如果不是加持穿着防弹背心的话。

"I'm nothing like my father! I don't use people as tools and throw them away, like he does!"  
“我绝不像我父亲那样！我不会把人当作工具使用然后抛弃，就像他那样！”

"No, you don't," Kaji consoled, trying to get Shinji to calm down, "and I didn't mean it that way. From what I've seen of you, you do what you do out of love. You don't want to hurt anyone. I meant in terms of tactical planning, you are more than match for him."  
“不，你确实不像他，”加持安慰道，试图让真嗣冷静下来，“我并不是那个意思。从我看到的你来看，你做这些是出于爱。你不想伤害任何人。我是说在战术规划方面，你完全能与他匹敌。”

"I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing," Shinji replied sullenly, looking at his hands, not daring to look the older man in the eyes.  
“我不知道这是好事还是坏事，”真嗣闷闷不乐地回答，看着自己的双手，不敢直视那位年长者的眼睛。

"In this case, trying to do what you need to do, I think it's a good thing. And a good plan, but let's make just a few modifications here and there…" Kaji said as he and Shinji continued to talk for just a little while longer. Finally, Kaji had to ask Shinji something that was bothering him just a bit.  
“在这种情况下，尽力去做你需要做的事，我认为是件好事。计划不错，但让我们稍作调整……” 加持和真嗣继续交谈了一会儿。最终，加持不得不问真嗣一个困扰他一点的问题。

"Shinji, I have a question about one part of the plan, though. Do you think that it would be fair to Asuka and the baby?"  
“真嗣，我有个关于计划中某部分的问题。你觉得这对明日香和宝宝公平吗？”

"What do you mean, Kaji?" Shinji asked, a bit perplexed, "I would never hurt them."  
“你什么意思，加持？”真嗣有些困惑地问，“我绝不会伤害他们。”

"Okay," he said, "let's try another tact, would it be fair to you? What if you don't get the answer you want?"  
“好吧，”他说，“我们换个角度，这对你公平吗？如果你得不到想要的答案呢？”

"It doesn't matter. Either way, I'll be there for them," Shinji replied, his jaw set in determination. Kaji just shook his head.  
“没关系，不管怎样，我都会陪在他们身边。” 真嗣回答道，下颌坚定地紧绷着。加持只是摇了摇头。

"Somehow, I believe you, Mr. Ikari. You are a much better man than I," Kaji said, "and I salute you!" Shinji blushed.  
“不知为何，我相信你，碇先生。你比我好得多，” 加持说，“我向你致敬！” 真嗣脸红了。

"I'm just a scared kid that doesn't know what to do to help the lady he loves…" Shinji replied, until what he said just hit him, "Aw crap! Did I just say that out loud?"  
“我只是个害怕的孩子，不知道该怎么做才能帮助他爱的女士……” 真嗣回答道，直到他意识到自己刚刚说漏了嘴，“糟糕！我刚刚是说出来了？”

"I didn't hear a thing, Mr. Ikari," Kaji said as he slapped Shinji on the back. "I promise you, I'll do everything I can to help you out. However, if you'll excuse me, there is a certain Major I need to go have my way with! Goodnight to you!" Shinji just shook his head and chuckled as the older man stood up and rubbed his hands together in anticipation as he headed off to Misato's room. A second later, a rather loud squeal emanated from the closed door, followed by the sound of crashing furniture. Shinji continued to laugh when he felt someone plop down beside him.  
“我什么都没听见，碇先生，” 加持说着拍了拍真嗣的背。“我向你保证，我会尽我所能帮助你。不过，请原谅我，我得去找某位少校了！晚安！” 真嗣只是摇了摇头，轻声笑了起来，看着这位年长的男人站起来，双手搓在一起，满怀期待地朝美里房间走去。片刻后，从紧闭的门后传来一声相当响亮的尖叫，紧接着是家具倒塌的声音。真嗣继续笑着，这时他感觉到有人在他旁边坐下。

"Perverts," Asuka muttered as she rubbed her temples. She had talked to Hikari for two and a half hours on the phone, and though it was a welcome reprieve from the stress of the last couple of days, it took it's toll.  
“变态。”明日香揉着太阳穴喃喃自语。她刚和光子通了两个半小时的电话，虽然这让她从近几天的压力中暂时解脱出来，但也付出了代价。

"Have a nice talk?" Shinji asked pleasantly as she leaned up against him. He thrilled at her touch, especially when it wasn't a slap or a punch. Asuka chuckled a bit.  
“聊得愉快吗？”真嗣愉快地问道，同时她靠在他身上。她的触碰让他感到兴奋，尤其是当那不是一记耳光或拳头时。明日香轻声笑了笑。

"Yeah. Thanks," she said as she rested her head on his shoulder, "Thanks for everything, Shinji."  
“嗯，谢谢。”她说着把头靠在他的肩膀上，“谢谢你的一切，真嗣。”

"You're welcome, Asuka," he replied, sighing contently as the two of them sat there for several minutes, just enjoying each other's company. Finally, she got up and stood there in front of him, her hands on her hips.  
“不客气，明日香。”他回答道，满足地叹了口气，两人就这样坐了几分钟，享受着彼此的陪伴。最后，她站起身来，双手叉腰站在他面前。

"You forgot to tell me something, though," she said scowling, looking down on him with those radiant blue eyes. Shinji gulped.  
“不过，你忘了告诉我一件事，”她皱着眉说，那双明亮的蓝眼睛俯视着他。真嗣咽了口唾沫。

"What did I forget to tell you, Asuka?" he stammered, wondering if she found out about the kiss Hikari planted on his cheek. She reached down and grabbed him by front of his shirt and pulled him up from the sofa to where he was standing just inches from her.  
“我忘了告诉你什么，明日香？”他结结巴巴地问，不知道她是否发现了光在他脸颊上留下的吻。她伸手抓住他的衬衫前襟，把他从沙发上拉起来，让他站在离她只有几英寸的地方。

"Actually, you forgot to give me something," she purred as she slid forward and wrapped her arms around his waist. Shinji smiled as wrapped his arms around the woman he cared so much for, remembering what it was he had forgotten to do.  
“实际上，你忘了给我某样东西，”她低声说着，向前滑去，双臂环住他的腰。真嗣微笑着，也用双臂环抱住这个他深爱着的女人，想起了自己忘记做的事情。

"Well, I didn't feel like getting beaten within an inch of my life," Shinji said as he pulled her close and buried his nose into her hair. She smelled of strawberries.  
“嗯，我不想被打得半死，”真嗣说着，将她紧紧拥入怀中，把鼻子埋进她的发间。她散发着草莓的香气。

"Just don't get any ideas, perv," she said mock-seriously. Shinji laughed.  
"别有什么奇怪的想法，变态。" 她半开玩笑地认真说道。真嗣笑了。

"With you dressed like that, it'll be hard to control myself, but I'll try!"  
你穿成这样，我很难控制自己，不过我会努力的！

"What the hell do you mean by that?" she asked as she pulled back to look in his eyes, trying hard not to get lost.  
"你这话什么意思？" 她后退一步，盯着他的眼睛问道，努力不让自己迷失其中。

"Like I said before, it doesn't leave much to the imagination," he grinned as peeked down her oversized yellow top, and then looked down at her shapely legs barely covered at all in her extremely short blue shorts. "After all, you're every man's dream!"  
就像我之前说的，这可没什么想象空间。" 他咧嘴一笑，瞥了一眼她那件宽大的黄色上衣，又低头看了看她那双几乎完全暴露在外的修长美腿，穿着极短的蓝色短裤。"毕竟，你是每个男人的梦想！

"Ach! You pervert! You jerk! I'll get you!" she said as she started to beat the snot out of him with the closest thing she could find, which happened to be a cushion from the sofa. Shinji was laughing hysterically as she continued to pound him with the not-so-serious weapon. He let go of the furious German and leapt over the sofa and started to run back to his room, laughing all the way.  
“啊！你这个变态！混蛋！我要抓住你！”她一边说，一边抓起手边最近的东西——沙发上的一个靠垫，开始对他拳打脚踢。真嗣笑得前仰后合，她继续用这个不那么严肃的“武器”猛击他。他放开了愤怒的德国女孩，跳过沙发，一路笑着跑回自己的房间。

"Shinji Ikari! Get your ass back here!" she yelled as she chased him across the room, just as he reached his doorway, "You coward!"  
“真嗣·一卡里！给我滚回来！”她一边追着他穿过房间，一边大喊，就在他到达门口时，“你这个胆小鬼！”

"He who fights and runs away…" was all he said before the cushion caught him squarely in the face, causing him to fall backwards as he closed his door. Maniacal laughter was heard coming from behind his door as the redhead stood there, breathing heavily, before she too, started giggling like crazy. She shook her head and walked back into her own room and slid the door closed. Unknown to the teenagers, three pairs of eyes watched them from behind Misato's door, jaws dropped in wonder.  
“战斗而后逃跑的人……”他刚说完，一个靠垫就正中他的脸，让他向后倒去，同时关上了门。门后传来疯狂的笑声，红发女孩站在那里，喘着粗气，随后也开始疯狂地笑起来。她摇了摇头，走回自己的房间，拉上了门。这对少年少女并不知道，有三双眼睛从美里房间的门后看着他们，惊讶得下巴都掉了。

"What the hell was that?" Misato said, stunned at the behavior of her charges.  
“那到底是什么鬼？”美里说道，对她的孩子们的行为感到震惊。

"Warrk!" Pen-Pen agreed with his owner.  
"Warrk!" 企鹅 Pen-Pen 同意了主人的话。

"Foreplay," Kaji replied as he reached over and pinched Misato's shapely butt, causing her to squeal a bit.  
"前戏，" 加持回答道，同时伸手捏了捏美里丰满的臀部，让她轻声尖叫了一下。

"Warrk!" Pen-Pen said in surprise as a foot connected to his butt and booted him out of the room. The door quickly closed behind him.  
"Warrk!" Pen-Pen 惊呼一声，被一脚踢出了房间，门迅速在他身后关上。

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was a few hours later when Shinji felt a warm body crawl into bed beside him and snuggle up, sniffling. He put his arm around her as she put her head on his chest. Asuka held him as tightly as she could, as the terrors of the dark had come back to attack her. Shinji was her lifeline now, and she wasn't afraid to admit it.  
几个小时后，真嗣感到一个温暖的身躯爬上床，紧贴着他，抽泣着。他将手臂环绕在她身上，她把头靠在他的胸前。明日香紧紧抱住他，黑暗中的恐惧再次袭来。真嗣现在是她的救命稻草，她毫不犹豫地承认了这一点。

"I'm sorry if I'm bugging you," she sniffed, fresh tears trying to force their way out of the corners of her eyes.  
“如果我打扰到你了，我很抱歉，”她哽咽着，新的泪水试图从眼角挤出来。

"You're not bugging me, Asuka. You're always welcome," Shinji replied as he felt some of the tension in her melt away, "That didn't come out quite right," he added, causing her to snort just a little, as more tension bled away.  
“你并没有打扰我，绫波。你随时都受欢迎，”真嗣回答道，感觉到她的一些紧张情绪消散了，“这么说可能不太恰当，”他又补充了一句，让她轻轻地哼了一声，更多的紧张感随之消解。

"Thank you for earlier," she said, "I really needed that."  
“谢谢你之前的陪伴，”她说，“我真的非常需要。”

"I know," he replied as he stroked her hair, making her coo just a bit. _"God, I love it when she does that ,"_ he thought, then felt guilty about it. "You're welcome."  
“我知道，”他回答着，轻抚她的头发，让她发出轻微的咕哝声。“天啊，我喜欢她这样，”他心想，随即感到一丝内疚。“不客气。”

"I...I had that dream again," she said after a few minutes.  
“我……我又做了那个梦，”几分钟后她说道。

"The one you were telling us you were having before all this happened?" he asked as he felt her nod her head.  
“就是之前你跟我们提起的那个梦吗？”他问道，感觉到她在点头。

"Yeah, that one," she answered, shivering somewhat. Shinji held her tighter.  
“对，那个梦，”她回答道，有些颤抖。真嗣把她抱得更紧了。

"Want to talk about it?" he asked as he stroked her hair again.  
“想谈谈吗？”他一边问，一边再次轻抚她的头发。

"You…you'll think badly of me," she replied, starting to sniffle again. Shinji was quick to reassure her.  
"你…你会对我有不好的看法的，"她回答道，又开始抽泣起来。真嗣迅速安慰她。

"I could never think badly of you, I promise," he said.  
"我绝不会对你有不好的看法，我保证，"他说。

"Promise?" 保证？

"Promise." 保证。

Asuka told him of how the dream always took place after a party of some sort. The guy in her dream treated her so good, and made her feel better than she ever had before. The dream got graphic after that, and she told Shinji how she had always thrown herself at the guy in her dream, acting like such a slut. But whenever she tried to see his face, she'd always wake up all hot and bothered. It used to be such a pleasant dream for her, until this happened. Now she wondered if really was a dream, and why she couldn't see the guy's face.  
明日香向他讲述了那个梦总是在某种聚会之后发生。梦中的那个男人对她非常好，让她感觉比以往任何时候都要好。之后梦境变得露骨，她告诉真嗣自己总是对梦中的男人投怀送抱，表现得像个荡妇。但每当她试图看清他的脸时，她就会浑身燥热地醒来。这曾经是她非常愉快的梦，直到这件事发生。现在她怀疑那究竟是不是梦，以及为什么她看不清那个男人的脸。

"Shinji, are you okay?" she asked as she felt his breathing increasing, his chest heaving almost violently.  
“真嗣，你还好吗？”她问道，感觉到他的呼吸加快，胸膛几乎剧烈地起伏。

"Yeah, I'm fine, Asuka," he lied as he tried to keep his voice from cracking, tears streaming out of the corners of his eyes.  
“嗯，我没事，明日香。”他撒谎道，试图不让自己的声音颤抖，泪水从眼角流了出来。

"Don't lie to me, Shinji. What's wrong?" she asked once more as she propped herself up on an elbow and stroked his face and came away with wet fingers. _"Tears?"_  
“别对我撒谎，真嗣。怎么了？”她再次问道，撑起身子，用一只胳膊肘支撑着，抚摸他的脸，手指沾湿了。“眼泪？”

"I…I can't tell you Asuka, because you'll end up hating me. You probably do any, seeing how weak I am." he continued, as his voice betrayed him and cracked. "It's stupid and it's selfish! I don't want to be any of that, I just want to be here for you!"  
“我…我不能告诉你，明日香，因为你会因此恨我。你大概已经恨我了，看我这么软弱。”他继续说道，声音却出卖了他，变得哽咽。“这很愚蠢，也很自私！我不想成为那样的人，我只想陪在你身边！”

"Tell me, please?" she pleaded, fearing she was about to lose him.  
“告诉我，求你了？”她恳求道，害怕即将失去他。

"I'm sorry," he said, knowing that he could never resist her, and knowing too that he was about to lose her, " but I always dreamed, deep down and secretly, to where I couldn't even think about it when I was awake, that…that I would be the father of your children! I am so fucked up. You probably hate me now more than you ever did before."  
“对不起，”他说，明知自己无法抗拒她，也明知自己即将失去她，“但我一直梦想着，深深地、秘密地，甚至在醒着的时候都无法去想，那就是…那就是成为你孩子的父亲！我真是太糟糕了。你现在可能比以往任何时候都更恨我。”

Asuka was shocked, totally and completely. Here was a great guy that she had treated like shit since they had met, and he had dreamed he would father her children? What the hell kind of man was he? He cared for her enough that ,even though his dream was shattered, he wanted to still be with her and take care of her and her baby? She didn't deserve to be with him, but she wanted to be with him so much that it hurt at times. What the hell has happened to her? What the hell has happened to him?  
明日香震惊了，完全彻底地。这个她从认识起就一直对他很差劲的好男人，竟然梦想过成为她孩子的父亲？他到底是个什么样的男人？他关心她到了这种程度，即使他的梦想破灭了，他仍然想留在她身边，照顾她和她的孩子？她不配和他在一起，但她太想和他在一起了，有时候这种渴望让她心痛。她到底怎么了？他又怎么了？

"I don't hate you, Shinji, and I never have," she said, "that was just my fear talking before. You really are a very special man, Shinji Ikari." She could feel him blush.  
“我不恨你，真嗣，从来都没有，”她说，“之前那只是我的恐惧在说话。你真的是一个非常特别的人，碇真嗣。”她能感觉到他脸红了。

"I couldn't protect you, so that you'd never have to go through this," he cried, feeling more like a failure now than he ever had before in his life. The stress of the past few days had caught up with him as well. " I suck!"  
“我没能保护你，让你不必经历这些，”他哭着说，感觉自己从未像现在这样失败过。过去几天的压力也终于压垮了他。“我真没用！”

"Hush now," she said firmly, but lovingly, "I'm not going to let my baby's father talk about himself that way. Do you understand?" She felt him calm down almost instantly.  
“好了，别说了，”她坚定而温柔地说，“我不会让孩子的父亲这样说自己。明白吗？”她感觉到他几乎立刻就平静了下来。

"Do you mean it?" he asked softly. "You still want me around?"  
“你是认真的吗？”他轻声问道，“你还希望我在你身边吗？”

"Yes, you idiot," she replied as she gently beat him on the chest, "you promised that you would never leave me, and I'm not going to let you chase yourself off . Now, let's get to sleep, your daughter needs her rest." With that, she snuggled back into his chest and quickly went to sleep. Her words made Shinji feel happier than anytime before in his short life. Slowly, he fell asleep, with a smile on his face.  
“是的，你这个傻瓜，”她一边回答，一边温柔地捶打他的胸膛，“你答应过永远不会离开我，我不会让你自寻烦恼的。现在，让我们睡觉吧，你女儿需要休息。”说完，她依偎回他的胸前，很快便睡着了。她的话让真嗣感到比以往任何时候都幸福。慢慢地，他带着微笑进入了梦乡。

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next several weeks flew by quickly, usually following the same routine as the first two days. The biggest difference was Asuka was now going back to school, with Shinji and Hikari watching after her. There were many people in school that really didn't like Asuka's attitude before, and now that she seemed to calm down quite a bit, they went out of their way to egg her on, or be cruel. It didn't help much that she had been excused from Physical Education classes, which drove several of the girls crazy. They went out of their way to be especially cruel to her. It didn't help much that her hormones decided it was time to go completely out of whack. No matter how hard she fought it, the slightest thing would set off a torrent of tears.  
接下来的几周飞逝而过，通常遵循着前两天的相同模式。最大的不同是明日香现在回到了学校，由真嗣和光照顾。学校里有许多同学之前并不喜欢明日香的脾气，现在她似乎平静了许多，他们反而变本加厉地挑衅或残忍对待她。她被免除了体育课，这让几个女生更加疯狂，她们特意对她更加刻薄。更糟糕的是，她的荷尔蒙决定彻底失控。无论她多么努力地克制，最微小的事情都能引发一阵泪流。

"This sucks!" she screamed as Hikari did her best to comfort her friend one day, glaring daggers into the girl that set off the tears, who stood there smugly with her arms crossed and completely pleased with herself. This girl was mad at Asuka because Asuka was Shinji's roommate, and Shinji was spending way too much time with her and not noticing the other girls, like the offender. She turned to walk away and came face to face with the object of her desires.  
“这太糟糕了！”她尖叫着，光一天都在尽力安慰她的朋友，同时用锐利的目光瞪着那个惹哭她的女孩，那女孩得意洋洋地站在那里，双手交叉，完全自得其乐。这个女孩对明日香生气，因为明日香是真嗣的室友，而真嗣花太多时间和她在一起，没有注意到其他女孩，比如那个惹事者。她转身走开，却迎面碰上了她心仪的对象。

"Oh, Hi Shinji! How are you doing today?" she said sweetly as she batted her eyelashes at him, "Say , do you wanna go catch a movie Saturday night? I'll make it a night you'll never forget."  
“哦，嗨，真嗣！你今天过得怎么样？”她甜甜地说，冲他眨了眨眼，“对了，周六晚上你想去看电影吗？我会让你度过一个难忘的夜晚。”

"What did you say to Asuka, Kiki?" Shinji inquired, as his blue eyes locked onto her brown ones and staring into her soul deeper than any laser could ever burn.  
“你对明日香说了什么，希希？”真嗣询问道，他的蓝眼睛紧盯着她的棕色眼睛，深深地凝视着她的灵魂，比任何激光都要灼热。

"Who? Her?," she made a derisive noise at the mention of Asuka, who continued to bawl in the corner of the hall. " I just told her what a tramp she really was for taking up all your time and such! The nerve of that little bitch, thinking she owned you or something!"  
“谁？她？”她提到明日香时发出了一声轻蔑的声音，明日香继续在走廊的角落里哭泣。“我只是告诉她，她真是个婊子，霸占了你所有的时间！那个小贱人，以为她拥有你还是怎么的！”

"Listen to me and listen good, Kiki," Shinji said in his deadliest voice, "You are one of the sorriest excuses for a human being I've ever met, and you are never to speak to Asuka or myself ever again! Is that understood?"  
听好了，Kiki，" 真嗣用他最冷酷的声音说道，"你是我见过的最差劲的人类之一，你永远不要再和我们说话！明白了吗？

"What?! How can you defend that little tramp!" Kiki shot back with tears in her eyes, "You're supposed to like me! Not her! That little bitch has been cheating on you, Shinji! Hoju says he's been dicking her every night for a month now! How can you trust that slut?!"  
"什么？！你怎么能替那个小贱人辩护！" Kiki 含泪反驳道，"你应该喜欢我！不是她！那个小婊子一直在骗你，真嗣！Hoju 说他每晚都和她上床！你怎么能相信那个荡妇？！”

"Leave. Now." was his reply, as the girl started bawling her eyes out and running down the hall. Shinji walked over to Asuka and wrapped his arms around her, which calmed her greatly. He held her for a minute or so before he took her by the hand and lead her back to class. This didn't go unnoticed by Shinji's two friends, who thought it best not to say anything to him just yet.  
"离开。现在。" 这是他的回答，女孩开始泪流满面地跑下走廊。真嗣走到明日香身边，用双臂抱住她，这让她平静了许多。他抱了她一会儿，然后牵着她的手带她回到教室。真嗣的两个朋友注意到了这一幕，他们认为最好暂时不要对他说什么。

Lunch was when all Hell truly broke loose. Asuka was in the hallway waiting for Shinji when a hand clasped on her shoulder roughly. Before she could turn around, a deep voice called out to her.  
午餐时，真正的混乱才爆发。明日香在走廊里等真嗣时，一只手粗鲁地搭在了她的肩膀上。她还没来得及转身，一个深沉的声音就向她喊道。

"Hey Soryu! Where's your boyfriend, Ikari? Does he know that you're carrying my bastard?" the voice barked as several other voices joined him in a laugh.  
"嘿，惣流！你男朋友碇在哪儿？他知道你怀了我的野种吗？" 那声音咆哮着，随即引来其他人的一阵哄笑。

_"Oh mein Gott! They know! Is…is he the one who…"_ she thought furiously as she went deathly white before the hand suddenly vanished from her shoulder in what felt like a whirlwind. Turning around, a shocking sight greeted her.  
"哦，我的天哪！他们知道了！是他……是他做的吗？" 她思绪如电，脸色煞白，突然间，搭在她肩上的手仿佛被旋风卷走般消失了。转身一看，眼前景象令人震惊。

Hoju, the biggest boy in the senior class, was pinned to the wall by Shinji. One of Shinji's hands held the wrist of the offending hand, which now hung at a strange angle and was turning blue. The other hand was wrapped around Hoju's throat and holding the boy off the ground, so only the tips of his toes were touching the floor. Hoju was making strange gurgling noises as he tried his best to remove Shinji's hand from his windpipe with his free hand, and having very little success. Shinji just grinned in a very feral fashion.  
浩二，高年级里个头最大的男孩，被真嗣按在墙上。真嗣一只手抓住了那只冒犯之手的腕部，使其以怪异的角度扭曲，并逐渐转为青紫色。另一只手则环绕在浩二的脖子上，将他整个人提离地面，只有脚尖勉强触地。浩二正竭力用空着的那只手试图掰开真嗣扼住他气管的手，却收效甚微，只能发出奇怪的咕噜声。真嗣则露出了野兽般的狞笑。

"Hello, Hoju," Shinji said, every word dripping with malice, "how's it hanging?"  
你好啊，浩二，" 真嗣说道，每个字都充满了恶意，"感觉如何？

"Urk…" was all Hoju said. No surprising, since Shinji was closing off his windpipe.  
"呃……" 浩助只说了这么一句。并不意外，毕竟真嗣正掐着他的气管。

"Not much to say? You seemed to have had plenty to say earlier. What was that you were telling everyone in school?" Shinji asked as he released some of the pressure from Hoju's windpipe, just enough to let him talk a bit.  
"没什么可说的吗？你之前在学校里不是挺能说的吗？那时候你跟所有人说了些什么？" 真嗣一边问，一边稍微松开了对浩助气管的压力，刚好让他能说几句话。

"Been…dicking…your…girl…month…" he got out before the vise-like grip tightened once more. His eyes looked pleadingly to the folks behind Shinji, waiting for something to happen.  
"一整个月……都在……搞你……女朋友……" 他勉强挤出这几个字，随后那铁钳般的手再次收紧。他的眼睛恳求地望向真嗣身后的人群，期待着有人能有所行动。

"Looking for backup? Nice bunch of friends you have, Hoju. They're afraid of a few sophomores?" Shinji said, which startled Asuka. Looking behind Shinji, she saw Touji, Kensuke, Rei, and Hikari standing there between Shinji and three other seniors who balked at the look in everyone's eyes.  
"在找帮手吗？浩助，你这帮朋友可真不错。他们连几个二年级学生都怕？" 真嗣的话让明日香吃了一惊。她朝真嗣身后望去，看到东治、健介、丽和光莉站在那里，挡在真嗣和另外三个畏缩的高年级学生之间。

"We gotcha back, Shinji, just do what you need to do," Touji called back behind him. Even Hikari was in agreement there, which truly surprised Asuka. And Rei looked ready to tear someone's head off if anyone took a step closer to her brother.  
"我们支持你，真嗣，做你该做的事，" 冬二在他身后喊道。甚至连光子也同意这一点，这让明日香真正感到惊讶。而丽看起来准备撕碎任何胆敢靠近她弟弟的人。

"Hmm, four seniors versus four EVA pilots. Who do you think would win, Hoju?" Shinji said as he released Hoju's broken arm and cocked his fist, ready to plant it squarely in the senior's face. Before he could let the punch fly, a pair of hands gently encased his fist.  
"嗯，四个高年级学生对四个 EVA 驾驶员。你觉得谁会赢，Hoju？" 真嗣说着松开了 Hoju 的断臂，握紧拳头，准备狠狠地打在高年级学生的脸上。在他出拳之前，一双温柔的手轻轻包裹住了他的拳头。

"It's okay, Shinji, let him go. He's not worth it. Please, baby?" Asuka pleaded with him, which immediately calmed the fire within his belly. He could never deny her. Releasing his grip, the senior slid to the floor at Shinji and Asuka's feet.  
"没事的，真嗣，放了他吧。他不值得你这么做。求你了，宝贝？" 明日香恳求他，这立刻平息了他心中的怒火。他永远无法拒绝她。松开手，高年级学生滑倒在真嗣和明日香的脚下。

"As you wish," he replied as he stared at the pile of human garbage at his feet. "It's your lucky day, Hoju. You're getting off easy. Now apologize and you might get to walk away from this."  
如你所愿，" 他回答道，目光盯着脚下的那堆人渣。"算你走运，Hoju。你这次逃过一劫。现在道歉，你或许还能从这里走开。

After Hoju knelt and profusely apologized for being such a total ass, his buddies helped him up and took him to the nurse. Hikari had already reported the incident to the school officials as a case of self-defense and coming to the aid of another. Hoju and his friends were immediately suspended from the school.  
在 Hoju 跪下并因表现得如此混蛋而连连道歉后，他的朋友们扶他起来并带他去了护士那里。Hikari 已经将此事报告给学校官员，称这是自卫行为并帮助了他人。Hoju 和他的朋友们立即被学校停学。

Walking to the tree where they always ate lunch, the six classmates stood around, not a one trying to eat until they got some things straightened out.  
走向他们常去吃午饭的那棵树，六个同学围站在周围，没有一个人试图吃东西，直到他们把一些事情理清楚。

"Damn, Shinji! What the hell is going on? What has been up with you lately?" Touji asked as he stood in front of his friend, trying to pry answers from him. "You snap at girls and you put seniors in the hospital! What gives?"  
该死，Shinji！到底怎么回事？你最近怎么了？" Touji 站在朋友面前问道，试图从他那里得到答案。"你对女生发火，还把学长送进了医院！这是怎么回事？

"I can't tell you," Shinji said with regret, " I swore to someone special I wouldn't tell."  
我不能告诉你，" Shinji 遗憾地说，"我向一个特别的人发过誓，不会说出去。

"Damn dude! That sucks! We could have been suspended! We could have gotten hurt! What the hell could be so important…" Touji ranted before hitting a brick wall named Asuka Soryu.  
"该死，伙计！那太糟糕了！我们本可能被停学的！我们本可能受伤的！到底有什么事情那么重要……" 真嗣抱怨着，直到撞上了名为惣流·明日香·兰格雷的砖墙。

"I'm pregnant," she said softly as she sat in the grass, tears once more streaking her face as Shinji and Hikari knelt down beside her to comfort her. Three other bodies promptly hit the ground, almost as fast as their jaws did.  
"我怀孕了，" 她轻声说道，坐在草地上，泪水再次划过她的脸颊，真嗣和光里跪在她旁边安慰她。另外三个人几乎同时倒地，下巴也几乎同时掉下来。

"Is this true, Shinji?" Rei asked as she crawled over to look him in the eye, never once blinking. Shinji looked her squarely in the eye and replied.  
"这是真的吗，真嗣？" 绫波零爬过来直视他的眼睛，从未眨眼。真嗣直视她的眼睛回答道。

"Yes, it's true." 是的，这是真的。

"Damn, Shinji! You and Asuka are having a kid, and you never even told us you were dating or anything! I thought we were your friends," Kensuke complained, sounding just a little hurt at his friend keeping secrets.  
"该死，真嗣！你和明日香都有孩子了，居然从没告诉我们你们在交往或者任何事情！我还以为我们是你的朋友呢。" 健介抱怨道，听起来对朋友隐瞒秘密感到有些受伤。

"Shinji's not the father," Asuka hiccupped, trying to stop the flow of tears, " Damn hormones!" Once more, jaws dropped.  
"真嗣不是孩子的父亲，" 明日香哽咽着试图止住泪水，"该死的荷尔蒙！" 又一次，众人的下巴都惊掉了。

"Uh, then who is?" Rei asked, actually blinking in confusion. Her eyes pleaded for answers from her brother.  
"呃，那谁是呢？" 丽问道，真的眨了眨眼表示困惑。她的眼神向哥哥求助，希望得到答案。

"We don't know, Rei," he told his sister honestly, "but I plan on being there as a father to this baby." Touji and Kensuke's eyes widened with shock, but Rei crawled over to Asuka and sat beside her.  
"我们不知道，丽，" 他诚实地告诉妹妹，"但我会以父亲的身份陪伴这个孩子。" 冬二和健介的眼睛因震惊而睁大，而丽则爬到明日香身边坐下。

"Asuka? What…is it like? Having a …child…inside you?" Rei asked, honestly wanting to know. There was something primal and pleading in her voice. Asuka found herself wanting to answer, but Shinji cut everyone off.  
"明日香？那……是什么感觉？体内……有个孩子……？" 绫波问道，真心想知道。她的声音中带着原始的恳求。明日香发现自己想要回答，但真嗣打断了所有人。

"Look, guys, this has to stay our secret! We can't have everyone in school knowing about this. Some people are already giving Asuka hell, it would just get worse if they found out the truth. So please don't tell anyone! That includes websites, emails, text messages, anonymous phone calls, letters to the editor, letters to anyone, banners or signs of any kind, video messages, recorded messages, scrolling marquees, notes in a bottle or even carrier pigeons! Nothing! Got it, Kensuke?" Shinji said as he paused to gather his breath from the long line of items he just rambled off, hoping that he hadn't skipped anything. He knew his friend too well, or so he thought.  
"听着，伙计们，这必须是我们之间的秘密！我们不能让学校里的每个人都知道这件事。有些人已经在给明日香找麻烦了，如果他们发现真相，情况只会变得更糟。所以请不要告诉任何人！包括网站、电子邮件、短信、匿名电话、给编辑的信、给任何人的信、横幅或任何形式的标语、视频信息、录音信息、滚动字幕、漂流瓶中的纸条，甚至是信鸽！什么都没有！明白了吗，剑介？" 真嗣说着，停下来喘口气，从他刚刚长串列举的项目中恢复过来，希望自己没有遗漏什么。他太了解他的朋友了，或者说他自以为如此。

"I understand, Shinji," Kensuke said, looking a little hurt, "Don't tell anyone. I may be a jerk, but I'm not heartless…" Thus the secret of Two, which became the conspiracy of Three, now became a fellowship of Six.  
"我明白，真嗣，" 剑介说，看起来有点受伤，"不要告诉任何人。我可能是个混蛋，但我不是没心没肺……" 就这样，原本的两人秘密，变成了三人的阴谋，如今又成了六人的同盟。

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rest of the day passed somewhat normally, as the teenagers continued to tease one another and hurl verbal barbs, all in good fun. It wasn't until after they got home and had dinner before tension began to fill the air. Asuka could sense it, but the emotional stress of the day had taken it's toll. Excusing herself, she went to her room and tried to go to sleep. Unfortunately, her mind was in such turmoil that sleep wouldn't come. Laying there on her bed, she was able to hear Shinji and Misato talking in rather loud voices. Not quite shouting, but not normal tones, either.  
那天剩下的时间过得还算正常，青少年们继续互相戏弄，言语间不乏尖锐的玩笑。直到他们回家吃完晚饭后，紧张气氛才开始弥漫。明日香能感觉到，但一天的情绪压力已经让她疲惫不堪。她借口离开，回到自己的房间试图入睡。不幸的是，她的思绪如此纷乱，以至于无法入眠。躺在床上，她能听到真嗣和美里在用相当大的声音交谈。虽然没有大喊大叫，但也不是正常的语调。

"Just what the hell do you think you were doing, Shinji! That Hoju boy ended up in the hospital with a broken arm!" Misato fussed. Asuka got up and slid her door open just a bit so as to peek and see what was going on. Shinji's reaction to Hoju had frightened her some, which was why she was so glad he calmed down when she asked him to. She had never seen him so intense before.  
"你到底以为你在干什么，真嗣！那个 Hoju 男孩最后进了医院，手臂都断了！"美里焦急地说道。明日香起身，轻轻推开房门，以便窥视外面的情况。真嗣对 Hoju 的反应让她有些害怕，这也是为什么她很高兴他在她请求后冷静下来。她从未见过他如此激烈。

"That doesn't matter, Misato! I was protecting Asuka! He grabbed her and…" Shinji stopped before he could tell Misato the rest.  
"这无关紧要，美里！我是在保护明日香！他抓住了她，而且……"真嗣停了下来，没有继续告诉美里剩下的部分。

"And what?!" she said exasperatedly. This was driving her nuts.  
"而且什么？！"她不耐烦地说道。这让她快要疯了。

"Misato," Shinji sighed, "we need to get a DNA test on Hoju and run it against the baby's DNA when we finally get a sample." Asuka and Misato's jaws both dropped.  
"美里，" 真嗣叹了口气，"我们需要对 Hoju 进行 DNA 检测，并在最终获得婴儿样本时将其 DNA 与之比对。" 明日香和美里的下巴都惊掉了。

"You don't think that…?" Misato gasped.  
"你不会是认为……？" 美里倒吸一口凉气。

"No, not really," Shinji replied, which caused Asuka untold relief, "but some of the things he said struck a little too close to home. We just need to make sure."  
不，不是真的，" 真嗣回答道，这让明日香松了一口气，"但他说的有些事情太贴近事实了。我们只是需要确认一下。

"Okay, Shinji. If you think that's what's best."  
好吧，真嗣。如果你觉得这是最好的办法。

"No, I don't! But whomever hurt Asuka needs to pay! I aim to see that happen! They will not be allowed to harm her again!" he snapped, then softened his tone. "I'm sorry, Misato."  
不，我不！但无论是谁伤害了明日香，都必须付出代价！我一定要看到这一幕！他们绝不能再伤害她！" 他厉声说道，随后语气缓和下来，"对不起，美里。

"Understandable, kiddo. She really means that much to you?" she asked, knowing the answer. Asuka waited for the answer as well. She knew what he had told her, but she wanted, no she _needed_ confirmation.  
"可以理解，孩子。她对你真的那么重要吗？" 她问道，心里其实已有答案。明日香也在等待回答。她知道他曾告诉过她的话，但她想要，不，她需要确认。

"More than I can possibly say. She always has, and even if she decides to reject me, I always will." Shinji smiled warmly as he thought of that conversation weeks ago.  
"比我所能表达的还要重要。她一直如此，即使她决定拒绝我，我也永远会这样。" 真嗣微笑着，回想起几周前的那次对话。

"What are you smiling about?" Misato teased as she saw the expression on his face.  
"你在笑什么？" 美里打趣道，注意到他脸上的表情。

"Just something she told me a while back, which I probably shouldn't tell you," all he got from that was a look of more promised teasing, " Oh well! She called me the baby's father. You can't have any idea how good that makes me feel!" A small tear tried to force it's way out of the corner of Misato's eye  
"她不久前告诉我的一些事，我可能不该跟你说，"他只得到了一个更意味深长的挑逗眼神，"哦，好吧！她称我是孩子的父亲。你无法想象这让我感觉有多好！" 美里眼角微微泛起泪光。

"I have a pretty good idea, seeing how happy you look whenever you two are together. By the way, I was talking to Kaji the other day and he mentioned a few things…"  
我能理解，看你们在一起时你那幸福的模样就知道了。对了，前几天我和加持聊过，他提到了一些事情……

_"Uh oh,"_ he thought, "Oh, _talking_, that's what you two call it! I'm sure that's not what the medical journals call it…OWW!" he yelped as Misato smacked him on the back of the head, good naturedly.  
"哎呀，"他心想，"哦，你们管那叫聊天！我敢肯定医学杂志上不会这么称呼……哎哟！" 美里好心地在他后脑勺上拍了一下。

"Now, now, no need to be rude," she said as he rubbed his sore head, " Kaji was telling about some interesting plans you have made. Care to fill me in?"  
好了，别这么粗鲁，"她看着他揉着疼痛的头说，"加持提到你有些有趣的计划。愿意跟我分享一下吗？

"Hmm, he must not be able to deny you, like I cannot deny Asuka," said Shinji, as the mentioned young girl heard this and filled it away for future reference, " Let's just say that it concerns looking after my family, all of my family: Asuka, the baby, you , and Rei."  
“嗯，他一定无法拒绝你，就像我无法拒绝明日香一样，”真嗣说道，提及的少女听到这话，默默记在心里，“这么说吧，这关系到照顾我的家人，所有的家人：明日香、宝宝、你，还有丽。”

"Warrk!" came an indignant call from the kitchen.  
“哇尔克！”厨房里传来一声不满的叫喊。

"Yes, you too, Pen-Pen. Can't forget you either!" the young man called back. Misato just stood there stunned, before retreating to the sofa. Shinji followed and took a seat close to her, as Asuka cracked the door open a bit more to hear.  
“是的，还有你，Pen-Pen。也不能忘了你！”年轻人回应道。美里站在那里愣住了，然后退到沙发上。真嗣跟过去，在她旁边坐下，明日香则稍稍推开门，想听得更清楚。

"You consider all of us your family?" was her shocked reply. "Shinji, you don't need to look after me, I _am_ a grown woman, after all. And you, you're just a …"  
“你把我们都当成你的家人吗？”她震惊地回应，“真嗣，你不需要照顾我，毕竟我是个成年人。而你，你只是个……”

"What, Misato? Just a kid? Just a boy? I haven't been one of those for a long time now. I'm just a guy who wants to take care of his loved ones. Yes, you included!" he said as Misato leaned against him and put her head on his shoulder and sighed.  
“什么，美里？只是个孩子？只是个男孩？我已经很久不是那样的了。我只是个想照顾好自己所爱之人的家伙。是的，也包括你！”他说着，美里靠在他身上，把头枕在他的肩上，叹了口气。

"Are you going to do what Kaji told me?" she asked, hoping that she wouldn't be disappointed.  
“你打算按照加治告诉我的去做吗？”她问道，希望自己不会失望。

"Yes, if she'll have me," this caused Asuka's heat rate to sky rocket as Shinji said the words.  
“是的，如果她愿意接受我，”这话让明日香的心跳急剧加速，因为真嗣说出了这些话。

_"What does that mean?"_ she wondered nervously, her mind refusing to make the connection.  
“那是什么意思？”她紧张地想，她的思维拒绝建立联系。

"… and if she doesn't, it won't matter. I promised to never leave, and I mean it!" Asuka's heart soared at this. What he had told her was true!  
"…如果她不这么做，也没关系。我承诺过永不离开，我是认真的！" 听到这话，明日香的心中涌起了希望。他告诉她的是真的！

"Shinji," Misato said softly as her heart burst with pride, as he was contemplating something many grown men would refuse to even think about, "You really are a special guy! Asuka is so lucky!" Shinji blushed.  
"真嗣，" 美里温柔地说道，心中充满了自豪，因为他正在思考许多成年男子甚至不愿去想的事情，"你真的很特别！明日香真是幸运！" 真嗣脸红了。

"No, if she was lucky, then this mess would have never happened and she wouldn't be in such pain." he said sadly before continuing, "Misato, I'll need you to call the school in the morning and tell them I'm not coming in. Hikari, Kensuke, and Rei will look after Asuka tomorrow. I have some…business…to attend to. I should be back before school let's out. I'll have something ready for you and Pen-Pen when you come in."  
不，如果她真的幸运，那么这一切就不会发生，她也不会如此痛苦。" 他悲伤地说道，然后继续说，"美里，我需要你明早打电话到学校，告诉他们我不去上课了。比吕志、健介和丽明天会照顾明日香。我有些…事情…要处理。我应该在放学前回来。我会为你和 Pen-Pen 准备好东西。

"Rei and Kensuke know?" Misato gasped, both at the news and how much like his father Shinji sounded. Not in a heartless way, just focused.  
"丽和健介知道？" 美里惊讶地问道，既因为这消息，也因为真嗣听起来多么像他的父亲。不是无情，只是专注。

"Touji, too. We told them today after they backed me up in school. They deserved that much."  
冬二也是。今天在学校他们支持我之后，我们告诉了他们。他们理应知道这些。

"I understand. Good luck tomorrow." the violet haired woman said as she got up and made her way to her room. "Don't stay up too late, okay?"  
我明白。祝你明天好运。" 紫发女子说着站起身，向她的房间走去。"别熬夜太晚，好吗？

"Gotcha, Misato. Sweet dreams!"  
知道了，美里。做个好梦！

"You, too!" she replied as she closed her door, leaving Shinji in the room with his thoughts. Tomorrow, all of their lives would change, hopefully for the better. It was taking every bit of his courage just to face what he had planned for the next day, but he would not falter. Slowly he got up and made his way to bed.  
"你也是！" 她回答着关上了门，留下真嗣独自在房间里沉思。明天，他们的生活将发生变化，希望是向好的方向。为了面对他计划中的明天，他需要鼓起全部勇气，但他不会退缩。他缓缓起身，走向床铺。

It wasn't more than five minutes after he hit the sheets before a familiar shape plopped in bed beside him and snuggled up to him. His smile could have lit up all of Tokyo-3 for a year. There hadn't been a night since Asuka found out she was pregnant that she hadn't sought comfort in Shinji's bed, but it was usually in the middle of the night, never so early in the evening.  
他刚躺下不到五分钟，一个熟悉的身影就扑通一声钻进了他旁边的被窝，紧贴着他。他的笑容足以照亮整个东京-3 一整年。自从明日香发现自己怀孕以来，她每晚都会到真嗣的床上寻求安慰，但通常都是在深夜，从未这么早过。

_"What could this mean?"_ he asked himself, then felt ashamed at the selfish feeling that washed over him. "Evening, m'lady!"  
“这意味着什么呢？”他自问，随即因涌上心头的自私感而感到羞愧。“晚上好，女士！”

"M'lady, hmmm? Does that make you my knight in shining armour, now?" she cooed as she propped up on one elbow, looking at his face in the dim light. She had never realized how cute he was when they first met, and now he was growing into a very handsome man.  
“女士，嗯？那你是我的白马王子了吗？”她一边用一只胳膊撑起身子，一边在昏暗的光线中凝视着他的脸，柔声说道。她从未意识到他们初次见面时他有多可爱，如今他正成长为一个非常英俊的男人。

"Purple and green, actually," Shinji chuckled, drawing a laugh from the woman who owned his heart. _"Damn! Does she know how much cooing drives me wild?"_  
“其实是紫色和绿色，”真嗣笑着说，逗得那位占据他心房的女人笑出声来。“该死！她知道她的呢喃让我多么疯狂吗？”

"So, what were you and Misato talking about? The tension this evening was thicker than a loaf of pumpernickel. I know you two talked after I went to bed." she said as she stroked his chest.  
"那么，你和美里在聊什么呢？今晚的气氛紧张得像一块厚厚的裸麦面包。我知道我睡觉后你们俩聊过。" 她一边说一边抚摸着他的胸膛。

"Oh, just about stuff. She chewed me out for hurting Hoju today and such," he replied, not wanting to let her know too much of what was about to happen.  
"哦，就是些琐事。她因为我今天伤害了浩二而训了我一顿，诸如此类的事，" 他回答道，不想让她知道太多即将发生的事情。

"Come on, I know it was more than that!" she purred in his ear "I know you can't deny me, you told Misato so,"  
得了吧，我知道不止这些！" 她在他的耳边低语，"我知道你不能拒绝我，你告诉过美里的，

"Sneak," he said as he tried to gather his thoughts. Unfortunately, with Asuka being so close and working her magic, it was very…difficult…to concentrate on anything but her touch and closeness. He knew she was counting on that. "Not fair!"  
狡猾，" 他说着试图整理思绪。不幸的是，由于明日香靠得这么近，施展她的魅力，他很难……集中注意力……除了她的触摸和亲近之外的任何事情。他知道她在利用这一点。"不公平！

"I never said life was fair," she continued to purr.  
“我从没说过生活是公平的，”她继续轻声细语地说。

"I'm going to go talk to someone tomorrow, to see what I can to help secure our baby's future, and yours as well."  
“我打算明天去找人谈谈，看看我能做些什么来确保我们孩子的未来，还有你的。”

"Do you really consider all of us your family? Rei included?" she asked, a little timidly.  
“你真的把我们都当成家人吗？包括丽？”她略带羞涩地问。

"Yes, Asuka, I do. Misato is like a mother to both of us, and Rei is my sister. You and the baby, well, you both occupy a very special place in my heart." he replied. He could feel warmth coming from the lady laying next to him.  
“是的，明日香，我确实这么想。美里对我们俩来说就像母亲一样，而丽是我的妹妹。你和宝宝，你们在我心中占据着非常特别的位置。”他回答道。他能感觉到躺在他身边的女士传来的温暖。

"Do you really think Hoju…?" she whispered quietly, her voice shaky.  
“你真的认为 Hoju…？”她轻声细语，声音颤抖。

"No, I don't. I don't think he came to the party, but it's best to rule him out," he said softly.  
“不，我不这么认为。我觉得他没来参加派对，但最好还是排除他的可能性，”他温柔地说。

"And…if he is?" she was almost crying now. Shinji reached over and caressed her face, calming her greatly.  
“那…如果他真的在呢？”她几乎要哭了。Shinji 伸手轻抚她的脸颊，大大安抚了她。

"It doesn't matter," he said, "he'll never touch you again, and he'll never know the baby. As far as I'm concerned, he doesn't exist. I care for you and the little one, Asuka. That will never change."  
“这无关紧要，”他说，“他再也不会碰你，也永远不会知道这个孩子。就我而言，他不存在。我只关心你和我们的孩子，Asuka。这一点永远不会改变。”

"Shinji?" she asked a few minutes later, after she calmed down. "_I have to know,"_ she thought desperately.  
"真嗣？"几分钟后，她平静下来问道，"我必须知道，"她绝望地想。

"Yes, hon?" he replied absentmindedly, not realizing what he just said.  
"嗯，亲爱的？"他心不在焉地回答，没意识到自己刚刚说了什么。

"Since when do you call me 'hon'? " Asuka said teasingly, knowing he had let something slip. Score one for Asuka.  
"你什么时候开始叫我'亲爱的'了？"明日香打趣地说，知道他不小心说漏了什么。明日香得一分。

"Since when do you call me 'baby'?" he asked, which drew a gasp from her.  
"你什么时候开始叫我'宝贝'了？"他反问道，让她倒吸了一口气。

"I never called…oh, wait…I did, didn't I?" she replied sheepishly, recalling the fight at school. She giggled a bit. He joined her.  
“我从没打过电话……哦，等等……我确实打了，对吧？”她有些尴尬地回答，回想起学校的那场争执。她轻声笑了起来。他也跟着笑了。

"Yes, you did. And thank you," he said from the bottom of his heart.  
“是的，你打了。谢谢你。”他由衷地说道。

"How do you really feel about me?" she asked, looking at his face once, "Please tell me?" She wasn't sure if she looked forward to his answer or not.  
“你对我到底是什么感觉？”她问，目光在他脸上停留片刻，“请告诉我好吗？”她不确定自己是否期待他的回答。

"Asuka," he said, letting out a long sigh, knowing this was the time, "I love you. I always have, and I always will."  
“明日香，”他说着，长叹一声，知道是时候了，“我爱你。我一直都爱着你，而且永远都会。”

"Really?!" she squeaked, not trusting her ears. It was too much to hope for.  
“真的吗？！”她惊呼道，不敢相信自己的耳朵。这希望太过渺茫。

"Yes, really," he said with a smile, grateful that she hadn't pulled away from him and bolted into her own room. What happened next shocked him beyond words, beyond thought. Asuka gently kissed him, this time a real kiss, without a nose pinch. Her lips were intoxicating, and he felt himself melt into the bed. All too soon, it was over and she lay next to him once more.  
“是的，真的。”他微笑着说，庆幸她没有挣脱他跑回自己的房间。接下来发生的事让他震惊得无法言喻，无法思考。明日香温柔地吻了他，这次是真切的吻，没有捏鼻子。她的唇令人陶醉，他感觉自己融化在床上。但很快，一切结束，她再次躺在他身旁。

"When you told Misato 'if she'll have me', what did you mean?" Asuka wondered, needing to know the answer to that question. She still hadn't made the connection.  
“你告诉美里‘如果她愿意接受我’，这是什么意思？”明日香想知道答案。她仍未理解其中的联系。

"I promise, I'll tell you tomorrow, Asuka. I have to get a few things straightened out tomorrow, then I promise I'll tell you everything. Okay?" he said, trying to dodge the question, and let her get some rest.  
“我保证，明天告诉你，明日香。明天我得先理清一些事情，然后我保证会把一切都告诉你。好吗？”他说道，试图回避问题，让她好好休息。

"Please?" she said in her most pleading voice.  
"求你了？" 她用最恳求的语气说道。

"Hush," it was now his turn to say it, " you and our little one need to rest . You have school tomorrow." A few minutes later, he felt the relaxed breathing of the fiery redhead as she slept peacefully on his chest.  
"嘘，" 现在轮到他说了，"你和我们的小家伙需要休息。你明天还要上学。" 几分钟后，他感觉到火红头发的她在他胸前平静地呼吸着，进入了梦乡。

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next day, Shinji stood before NERV headquarters, waiting for his backup to arrive. He paced nervously, for even though he was firm in his resolve, years of avoiding conflict had instilled the 'flight' part of the 'fight-or-flight' mechanism deep within his psyche. It was difficult, but Shinji would stand his ground. This was for Asuka.  
第二天，真嗣站在 NERV 总部前，等待着他的支援到来。他紧张地踱步，尽管他意志坚定，但多年来避免冲突的习惯已经深深植入了他的'逃避'本能。这很困难，但真嗣会坚守阵地。这是为了明日香。

"Looking sharp, Mr. Ikari. I see that you took my advise," his backup called out as he approached.  
"看起来很精神啊，一尉。看来你采纳了我的建议，" 他的支援者走近时喊道。

"Thanks, Kaji" was Shinji's reply as he looked down at what he was wearing. His clothing was almost entirely black, as Kaji had told him to dress as intimidating as he could, as if for battle. His new black suit was perfectly tailored to give him the most imposing look possible. His jacket was unbuttoned, revealing the black silk shirt beneath. Black leather driving gloves covered his hands like a second skin and his black boots held the perfect spit shine. The only trace of color anywhere was the blood red silk tie that hung from Shinji's neck, and knotted perfectly. Kaji was astounded at the look Shinji had, a younger version of his father. Same intensity of the eyes, different drive. The statement was almost complete.  
“谢谢，加持先生。”真嗣回答道，同时低头看着自己的穿着。他的衣服几乎全是黑色，因为加持告诉他要尽量穿得有威慑力，仿佛要上战场一般。他那套新定制的黑色西装完美地塑造出最具威严的形象。外套没有扣上，露出了里面的黑色丝绸衬衫。黑色皮革驾驶手套紧贴着他的双手，仿佛第二层皮肤，而他的黑色靴子则被打磨得光亮如新。全身唯一的色彩点缀是挂在真嗣脖子上的那条血红色丝绸领带，打结得恰到好处。加持看到真嗣这副模样，不禁惊叹，他简直就是他父亲的年轻版。眼神中的强度如出一辙，但内在的动力却截然不同。这种形象几乎完美无缺。

"Nice touch," Kaji said as pointed to the tie. Shinji blushed a bit at the complement. Kaji held out a small box for Shinji to open. "Here's the finishing touch!"  
“很棒的点睛之笔。”加持指着领带说道。真嗣听到夸奖，脸上微微泛红。加持递给真嗣一个小盒子，让他打开。“这是最后的点睛之笔！”

"Whoa," Shinji replied as he opened the box, and pulled out a pair of red tinted glasses with wire rims and round lenses. He put them on, worrying whether he would be able to see out of them properly, but was surprised when he discovered they seemed to make things a little more sharp. "Thanks."  
“哇哦。”真嗣打开盒子，拿出了一副红色镜片的金属框圆形眼镜。他戴上眼镜，担心是否能看清东西，但惊讶地发现它们似乎让视野变得更加清晰锐利。“谢谢。”

"And now the image is complete," Kaji said as he patted Shinji on the shoulder. "The eyes are the window to the soul, and a master tactician never allows any opening to be revealed. Ready?"  
“现在图像完整了，”加持拍了拍真嗣的肩膀说道，“眼睛是心灵的窗户，而一位高明的战术家绝不会露出任何破绽。准备好了吗？”

"Is everything in order?" Shinji asked in a controlled way that made Kaji shiver. _"Too much like Gendo"_ he thought.  
“一切都安排妥当了吗？”真嗣以一种让加持感到寒意的冷静语气问道，“太像源堂了。”他心想。

"Yes sir, Mr. Ikari! All is in readiness and everything is set. Here is the documentation you requested," Kaji said as he passed a thick envelope to Shinji, who flashed him a smile in thanks.  
“是的，碇先生！一切准备就绪，所有事项均已安排妥当。这是您要求的文件。”加持说着递给真嗣一个厚厚的信封，真嗣回以微笑表示感谢。

"Shall we proceed then?" Shinji said as he slid the envelope into his jacket pocket and turned. He and Kaji proceeded to enter NERV HQ.  
“那我们开始吧？”真嗣将信封塞进夹克口袋，转身说道。他和加持一同进入了 NERV 总部。

The reactions Shinji received when he traveled through headquarters was the exact one he wished to achieve. Jaws dropped, people stared, and crowds parted before him. He never noticed, as his focus was directed toward the office that was his end destination.  
真嗣在总部穿行时引起的反应，正是他希望达到的效果。人们目瞪口呆，纷纷注视，人群在他面前分开。他并未注意到这些，因为他的注意力完全集中在他的最终目的地——办公室上。

Misato looked up from her desk, wondering for the hundredth time why in hell so much paperwork was require to be filled out when there hadn't been an Angel attack in months, when something strange caught her eye. Jumping up quickly, she rushed to the door to just in time to see a very different Shinji marching down the hall.  
美里从办公桌前抬起头，第无数次疑惑为何在没有天使袭击的几个月里，还需要填写如此多的文件，这时，一些奇怪的事情吸引了她的目光。她迅速起身，冲到门口，正好看到一个截然不同的真嗣正大步走过走廊。

"Shinji?" she called out as the young man stopped and turned to greet her.  
“真嗣？”她喊道，年轻人停下脚步，转身向她打招呼。

"Good morning, Major," Shinji replied in a cool, controlled voice which startled the hell out of Misato, "Is your day going well?"  
“早上好，美里少校，”真嗣用冷静而沉稳的声音回答，这让美里大吃一惊，“你今天过得还好吗？”

"Uh, yeah, it is. But, what are…" she asked as Kaji caught up with her and lead her into her office.  
“呃，是的，没错。但是，什么……”她问道，这时 Kaji 追上了她，领她走进办公室。

"Not now, Misato, this is something Shinji must do," he whispered to her as she stared at her charge as he walked back down the hallway toward an office that most people in NERV avoided like the plague.  
“现在不行，美里，这是真嗣必须做的事，”他低声对她说，她盯着她的监护对象，他正沿着走廊走回一间大多数人避之不及的办公室。

"Commander?" the secretary called out over the intercom, "You…you have a visitor." Gendo Ikari growled at the intrusion, which drew a small chuckle from Fuyutsuki.  
“指挥官？”秘书通过内部通讯喊道，“您……您有访客。”Gendo Ikari 对打扰发出低吼，这让 Fuyutsuki 轻笑了一声。

"Tell them to go away," he snarled as he and Fuyutsuki turned back to the plans they had been making.  
“告诉他们离开，”他咆哮着，与 Fuyutsuki 转身继续他们正在制定的计划。

"Sir, he refuses. It's your son…" the secretary called back again. Gendo sighed with irritation. Fuyutsuki raised an eyebrow in surprise.  
"先生，他拒绝了。这是您的儿子……" 秘书再次回电。源渡不耐烦地叹了口气。冬月扬起眉毛，显得有些惊讶。

"Send him in, and clean out your desk. I will not tolerate failure to follow my instructions," Gendo replied as he grinned viciously at the startled cry that came from the intercom. The door opened and Gendo listened to the footsteps steadily making their way across the room. There was no hesitation in the stride, which surprised Gendo. He looked up at Fuyutsuki's face, but his old sensei's expression was unreadable.  
"让他进来，然后清理你的桌子。我不能容忍不遵守我的指示。" 源渡回答道，同时恶毒地笑着，对从对讲机传来的惊呼声感到满意。门开了，源渡听着脚步声稳稳地穿过房间。步伐中没有犹豫，这让源渡感到惊讶。他抬头看向冬月的脸，但这位老导师的表情难以捉摸。

"What is it?" Gendo said dismissively, not even bothering to turn to face his son.  
"什么事？" 源渡不屑一顾地说，甚至懒得转身面对他的儿子。

"Father," a cold, controlled voice called back, freezing Gendo on the spot, " was that truly necessary?" Gendo spun around slowly.  
"父亲，" 一个冷静而克制的声音回应道，让源渡愣在原地，"那真的有必要吗？" 源渡缓缓转过身来。

He came face to face with a younger version of himself. Shinji stood like a wraith before his father's desk, blending into the shadows perfectly, with the exception of his face, glasses and tie. For the first time in a long while, Gendo felt a shiver run down his spine. Shinji's face was unreadable, and the light reflected eerily off the blood red glasses. Shinji's manner was completely foreign.  
他直面了一个更年轻的自己。真嗣如幽灵般站在父亲的书桌前，完美地融入了阴影中，除了他的脸、眼镜和领带。许久以来，源渡第一次感到脊背发凉。真嗣的面容难以捉摸，光线诡异地反射在那血红色的眼镜上。真嗣的态度完全陌生。

"I will not tolerate failure, as well you know."  
“我不容忍失败，你也清楚。”

"Then how do you tolerate yourself?" Shinji replied, causing Gendo to pause and Fuyutsuki's jaw to drop. No one _ever_ spoke to the Commander that way. "I refused to leave, she was not to blame."  
“那你又如何容忍自己？”真嗣反问道，让源渡顿住，而冬月也惊讶得下巴都快掉了。从未有人这样对司令说话。“我拒绝离开，她没有错。”

"A man must take responsibility for his own actions," Gendo replied, making no sign that he had even heard Shinji's insult..  
“一个人必须为自己的行为负责，”源渡回答，丝毫没有表现出听到真嗣的冒犯。

"Indeed, and so I shall," came the cold reply, shocking the two older men somewhat. This was definitely not the Shinji either of them knew. "Let me come to point."  
确实如此，我会的。"冷冷的回答让两位年长者有些震惊。这绝对不是他们所认识的真嗣。"让我直奔主题。

"Please do, my time is not to be wasted," the elder Ikari said smugly. Shinji smiled coldly.  
"请讲，我的时间不容浪费。"碇源堂得意地说道。真嗣冷冷一笑。

"I have come to discuss the Second Child." Shinji said, as if it was the most obvious thing, and only an idiot would miss it.  
"我来讨论第二适格者的事。"真嗣说道，仿佛这是再明显不过的事，只有傻瓜才会忽略。

"Of course. You are transparent, you know," Gendo said, smiling. Section 2's reports were accurate after all. He had doubted Shinji would act the way they had reported.  
"当然。你很透明，你知道的。"碇源堂微笑道。第二分部的报告果然准确。他曾怀疑真嗣是否会如报告中所述行事。

"No more so than you," Shinji shot back, causing Gendo to drop the smile. "I have need to know what you plan to do with Miss Soryu. She is in no condition to tolerate the stress of uncertainty. Her future must be assured." Fuyutsuki's eyes shot open wide as saucers. Gendo just sat there.  
"不比你少，"真嗣回敬道，让源渡的笑容消失了。"我需要知道你对绫波零的计划。她现在无法承受不确定性的压力。她的未来必须得到保障。"冬月瞪大了眼睛。源渡只是坐在那里。

"I have yet to decide her fate, Pilot Ikari. I fail to see how that concerns to you. After you're little escapade in the medical wing, it should be your fate that you should worry about. "  
我还没有决定她的命运，碇司令。我不明白这与你何干。在你医疗翼的小插曲之后，你应该担心的是你自己的命运。

"Ah, I see," Shinji said as he pushed his glasses up his face exactly like Gendo. "It does concern you, and everyone else, Father."  
啊，我明白了，"真嗣说着，像源渡一样推了推眼镜。"这确实关系到你，也关系到所有人，父亲。

"How so? What is to keep me from shipping her off to Germany, broken and destitute?" his father asked, not used to being questioned by a subordinate.  
"怎么会？有什么能阻止我把她送到德国，破碎且穷困？"他的父亲问道，不习惯被下属质问。

"I am," the young pilot replied, "if you wish for me to pilot Unit One ever again.  
我是，"年轻飞行员回答道，"如果你希望我再次驾驶初号机的话。

"What?!" his father barked, standing up behind the desk. "What makes you think we need you to pilot Unit One? We can use any pilot, or the Dummy Plug System! I should ship you away, as before. We have no need for you."  
什么？！"他的父亲咆哮着，从桌子后面站了起来。"你凭什么认为我们需要你来驾驶初号机？我们可以用任何飞行员，或者使用傀儡系统！我应该像以前那样把你送走。我们不需要你。

"You lie poorly, Father," Shinji said calmly as he produced the envelope from his jacket and pulled several document from it and threw them on Gendo's desk. "As you well know, Unit One will not accept another pilot. Nor will she accept the Dummy Plug System. I, and only I, can pilot Unit One. She will reject everything else."  
你撒谎的水平很差，父亲，"真嗣平静地说着，从夹克里拿出信封，抽出几份文件扔在源堂的桌上。"正如你所知，初号机不会接受其他飞行员。她也不会接受傀儡系统。只有我，只有我才能驾驶初号机。她会拒绝其他一切。

"She?" Gendo asked blankly, praying that Shinji hadn't discovered the secret of his EVA's power.  
"她？"源堂茫然地问道，祈祷着真嗣没有发现他的 EVA 力量的秘密。

"Mother." he said simply, causing Gendo to blanch.  
“母亲。”他简单地说道，让源堂脸色一变。

"How? How did you know?" Gendo asked with genuine interest. He looked at the documents on the desk. Fuyutsuki went deathly pale. "_Yui."_  
“怎么？你怎么知道的？”源堂带着真正的兴趣问道。他看着桌上的文件，冬月则变得面无血色。“唯。”

"You're not going to find it in any document there, Father. You did too good of a job purging all files. You, however, cannot purge _her_. She tells me, every time I sync with Unit One. I even know the secret of how she became one with the EVA." Shinji added with a sinister smile. "Doctor Akagi's mother was an …_interesting_…woman, to say the least. Evil, to say the most. I can see the experiment in my mind every time I climb into that entry plug, I can see how the previous Doctor Akagi purposely set the controls to keep mother from escaping, to cause her death. Do you think that Project E's top scientist couldn't spot sabotage to the systems she carefully crafted, right down to the fail-safes that didn't kick in. That was an inside job, and she knew it."  
“你在那些文件里是找不到的，父亲。你做得太彻底，把所有档案都清除了。但你无法清除她。每次我与初号机同步时，她都会告诉我。我甚至知道她是如何与 EVA 合为一体的秘密。”真嗣带着阴险的笑容补充道，“赤木博士的母亲是个……至少可以说是有趣的女人……说极端点，是邪恶的。每次我进入插入栓，我都能在脑海中看到那个实验，看到前一位赤木博士是如何故意设置控制器，阻止母亲逃脱，导致她的死亡。你以为 E 计划的首席科学家会看不出她精心设计的系统被人蓄意破坏，连那些未启动的安全措施都一清二楚。那是内鬼所为，她心知肚明。”

Gendo plopped into his seat, deflated. He had always suspected it, but Doctor Akagi had covered her tracks very well. No proof existed. Shinji had him over a barrel, because without Unit One, any plans for the future he would create would vanish like the morning dew in the heat of day.  
源堂一屁股坐进椅子里，整个人都泄了气。他一直有所怀疑，但赤木博士掩盖得很好，没有任何证据。真嗣把他拿捏得死死的，因为没有初号机，他未来计划的任何蓝图都会像晨露在烈日下一样蒸发殆尽。

"What do you want, Shinji?" Gendo asked, causing Shinji's heart to skip, but showing no outward sign of it.  
“你想要什么，真嗣？”源堂问道，这让真嗣的心跳漏了一拍，但他表面上没有显露出来。

"First off," Shinji stated as he read off the list he had memorized over the past two weeks, "Asuka and baby are to stay here in Japan, under mine and Major Katsuragi's care, and no harm is to come to either one of them. This is paramount."  
“首先，”真嗣说道，他按照过去两周背熟的清单逐条念出，“明日香和婴儿要留在日本，由我和葛城少校照顾，不能让她们受到任何伤害。这是最重要的。”

"Understood," Gendo replied, his hands propped up on the desk and hiding the lower part of his face.  
“明白了，”源堂回答，双手撑在桌上，遮住了下半张脸。

"Next, she is to be taken off the current combat rolls and put on indefinite paid leave until such time as I and her doctors see fit to release her," Shinji stated firmly, This was not up for discussion, as far as he was concerned.  
“接下来，她将被调离当前的战斗序列，无限期带薪休假，直到我和她的医生认为合适时再让她归队，”真嗣坚定地说道，在他看来，这件事没有商量的余地。

"What if we need Unit Two to battle the Angels?" Fuyutsuki asked, wondering if the young pilot had thought that far in advance. Gendo nodded in agreement.  
“如果我们需要二号机去对抗使徒怎么办？”冬月问道，想知道这位年轻的驾驶员是否已经考虑到了这一点。碇点点头表示同意。

"Indeed. We cannot leave ourselves defenseless due to some child's whim," Gendo added, trying to get a reaction from Shinji. He got one.  
“确实如此。我们不能因为某个孩子的任性而让自己陷入无防备状态，”碇补充道，试图激起真嗣的反应。他成功了。

"That problem has been solved," Shinji said as he held up a small device and clicked a button. The doors opened once more as another figure walked into the room and stood beside Shinji.  
“这个问题已经解决了，”真嗣说着举起一个小装置并按下按钮。门再次打开，另一个人物走进房间，站在真嗣旁边。

"Pilot Suzahara reporting in for duty, Commander," Touji said as he snapped to attention before Gendo and Fuyutsuki. Both men were taken aback.  
"飞行员铃原报告执勤，指挥官，" 东治说着在源渡和冬月面前立正。两人都有些惊讶。

"With the modifications specified in this file made to Unit Two and the Dummy Plug System, Pilot Suzahara will have no trouble piloting the EVA. His injuries have healed nicely and he is ready to do his part." Shinji said as he placed the file before the Commander. "A copy of this has been given to Lt. Ibuki for implementation."  
按照这份文件对二号机和模拟插入系统进行的改装，铃原驾驶员将能轻松驾驶 EVA。他的伤势已经痊愈，准备好履行他的职责了。" 真嗣说着将文件放在指挥官面前。"这份文件的副本已经交给伊吹少尉执行。

"Anything else?" Gendo asked, know this wasn't the end.  
"还有别的吗？" 源渡问道，知道这还不是全部。

"Indeed. Major Katsuragi, Pilot Soryu, and I have need of larger living accommodations, seeing how a new member of the family is on it's way," Shinji saw Gendo flinch at the word 'family', "We also have need in a large increase in our allowances and pay. I also request that my sister is to removed from the horrid conditions in which she currently resides and have her moved next to us."  
确实。葛城少校、绫波驾驶员和我需要更大的居住空间，考虑到家庭新成员即将到来，" 真嗣看到源渡听到'家庭'这个词时微微一颤，"我们还需要大幅增加津贴和工资。同时，我请求将我妹妹从她目前恶劣的居住环境中移出，让她搬到我们旁边。

"And?" the elder Ikari wondered.  
"然后呢？" 碇司令疑惑地问。

"Pilot Soryu is to be escorted to and from her prenatal checkups at the hospital. Doctor Akagi and her staff are not to come close to Pilot Soryu unless it is a life threatening emergency. Also, Major Katsuragi is to be assigned an assistant to help her in her duties as Operations Director, and given a larger office. I have someone in mind for her assistant."  
明日香·索耶驾驶员需由专人护送往返医院进行产检。除非是危及生命的紧急情况，否则赤木律子医生及其团队不得接近明日香。此外，葛城美里少校将配备一名助手协助其履行作战部主任职责，并为她安排一间更大的办公室。我心中已有人选担任她的助手。

"Understood." 明白了。

"We also need to start a search for the father of the child. I suggest DNA testing and comparison with a sample that shall be provided by the doctor in the future. The father is to have nothing to do with the child, and punished appropriately for his transgressions. This needs to start immediately. I suggest starting with every male who attended Major Katsuragi's party, as well as all males currently going to school with myself and Pilot Soryu."  
我们还需要开始寻找孩子的父亲。我建议进行 DNA 测试并与未来由医生提供的样本进行比对。孩子的父亲不得与孩子有任何接触，并应因其过错受到适当惩罚。此事需立即启动，我建议从参加过葛城美里少校派对的每位男性以及目前与我及明日香同校的所有男性开始调查。

"Agreed," the older men said in unison. They could not believe the change that overcome Shinji.  
"同意，"年长的男士们齐声说道。他们无法相信真嗣身上发生的变化。

"Thank you, gentlemen. By your leave," he bowed as he and Touji turned to leave. They got about three steps before Commander Ikari called back out.  
"谢谢各位，请允许我告辞，"他鞠躬后与冬二转身离开。他们刚走了大约三步，碇司令又叫住了他们。

"Do you need a ride back home, Shinji? I heard that you have sold you motorcycle." Shinji stopped in his tracks, as Touji's jaw hit the floor.  
"真嗣，你需要搭车回家吗？我听说你把摩托车卖掉了。"真嗣停下脚步，冬二的下巴惊讶得几乎掉到地上。

"Dude? Your bike?" Touji stammered as Shinji waved him quiet.  
"兄弟？你的摩托车？"冬二结结巴巴地说，真嗣示意他安静。

"That would be appreciated, Father," Shinji replied, not knowing what to make of his father's sudden interest. "Thank you."  
那真是感激不尽，父亲，" 真嗣回答道，对他的父亲突然的关心感到不知所措。"谢谢您。

"Why did you sell your bike, Shinji?" Fuyutsuki asked gently. He had always had a soft spot in his heart for Yui's son.  
"你为什么卖了你的自行车，真嗣？" 冬月温和地问道。他一直对唯的儿子怀有深深的同情。

"Expenses, sir. Unexpected expenses." was the reply.  
"是开销，先生。意外的开销。" 真嗣回答道。

"Was it expensive?" the older man asked. Shinji stiffened at the question. Touji was completely clueless.  
"很贵吗？" 年长者问道。真嗣听到这个问题时身体一僵。透治则完全摸不着头脑。

"Not unduly so, sir," he answered, recovering somewhat. Never show weakness, Kaji had told him.  
"并非如此，先生，"他回答道，稍稍恢复了些镇定。卡吉曾告诉他，永远不要表现出软弱。

"Do you love her?" his father asked, shaking Shinji to the core, but not showing any outward sign of such, merely a cocking of an eyebrow.  
"你爱她吗？"父亲问道，这问题让真嗣内心震动，但他没有流露出任何外在迹象，只是微微挑了挑眉毛。

"Yes," Shinji replied with conviction, as if that was the dumbest question in the world. Touji looked like he was ready to hit the floor. Before he could turn to leave, his father spoke once more.  
"是的，"真嗣坚定地回答，仿佛这是世界上最愚蠢的问题。东治看起来像是要摔倒在地。在他转身离开之前，父亲再次开口。

"I have met your requests, now you will meet one of mine."  
我已经满足了你的请求，现在你也要满足我一个。

"_Aw crap,"_ he thought, _"here it comes…"_  
糟糕，" 他心想，"它来了……

_--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------_

"Commander on the Deck!" Fuyutsuki called out as everyone stood. Gendo strode out onto the command dais and turned to face the assemble crew.  
"指挥官到舰桥！" 冬月喊道，所有人起立。源渡大步走向指挥台，转身面对集合的船员。

"As many of you may know, there is a current crisis concerning the Second Child," the elder Ikari stated, "effective immediately, all male NERV personnel will submit to mandatory DNA testing to determine the perpetrator of this crisis. Any and all personnel refusing to be tested will be terminated and subject to criminal investigation and or prosecution. Medical personnel will be around shortly to collect the samples. This is NOT optional!"  
正如你们中许多人所知，目前存在与二号适格者相关的危机，" 老伊卡里声明，"立即生效，所有男性 NERV 人员将接受强制 DNA 检测，以确定此次危机的肇事者。任何拒绝检测的人员将被解雇，并接受刑事调查和/或起诉。医疗人员将很快前来收集样本。这不是可选的！

There was a general mood of discontent at the commander's announcement, not wanting to believe that they were suspects in harming the Second Child. Some were outright hostile to the idea. Aoba was the most vocal.  
指挥官的宣布引起了一般的不满情绪，他们不愿相信自己成了伤害二号适格者的嫌疑人。有些人对此想法极为反感。青叶是最直言不讳的。

"What the hell is this, Commander? Who the hell came up with this Machiavellian dictate? I find it extremely offensive that we are accused of a crime without proof!" Aoba shout toward the dais, not caring what either of the older men thought.  
“这到底是什么鬼东西，指挥官？谁他妈想出这个马基雅维利式的命令？在没有证据的情况下指控我们犯罪，我觉得这极其冒犯！”Aoba 对着讲台大喊，不在乎两位年长者的想法。

"The idea was _mine,_" a controlled voice replied from behind the Commander, " Is that an admission of guilt, Lt. Aoba?"  
“这个主意是我出的，”一个沉稳的声音从指挥官背后传来，“这是认罪吗，Aoba 中尉？”

"Who the hell is that?" Aoba barked. The voice sounded somewhat familiar.  
“那他妈是谁？”Aoba 吼道。这个声音听起来有些熟悉。

"The new Commander of Combat Groups, Captain Ikari," Fuyutsuki announced as Shinji stepped from behind the two men, brand new captain's bars pinned to the lapel of his jacket. "Captain Ikari will be in command anytime the operations director, Major Katsuragi, is indisposed. His main purpose is to command the operational combat groups in the field. If the Major isn't here, you will report to the Captain."  
“新任战斗群指挥官，碇队长，”冬月宣布道，同时真嗣从两位男士身后走出，崭新的队长徽章别在他的夹克翻领上。“当作战部长葛城少校不在时，碇队长将接管指挥权。他的主要职责是在战场上指挥作战战斗群。如果葛城少校不在，你们将向碇队长报告。”

"Do you have a problem with this, Lt. Aoba?" Shinji asked, sounding too much like his father for anyone's taste. "If not, I suggest you volunteer to be the first one to be tested to prove your innocence."  
“你对这个有意见吗，青叶中尉？”真嗣问道，他的语气太像他父亲，让人难以接受。“如果没有，我建议你自愿成为第一个接受测试的人，以证明你的清白。”

"Uh, yes sir," Aoba replied as the medical teams entered the bridge and started to do their job. Gendo and Fuyutsuki glanced at one another as Shinji stepped forward, hands clasped behind his back.  
“呃，是的，长官，”青叶回答道，医疗团队进入了舰桥并开始工作。源渡和冬月互看了一眼，真嗣则向前一步，双手背在身后。

_"Sleeper, indeed,"_ the elder Ikari thought as a small smile etched itself on his face, as he watched Shinji observe the medical staff collect their samples. Many of the medical staff on the floor would glance toward Shinji and shiver as the cold stare he gave them spurred them on their way.  
“真是个潜伏者，”老碇心想，脸上露出一丝微笑，他看着真嗣观察医疗人员采集样本。许多在场的医疗人员瞥向真嗣时都会打颤，他那冰冷的目光催促着他们继续工作。

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Misato Katsuragi was beside herself. One moment she was working on some paperwork as she was speaking to Kaji. Next, an army of NERV personnel descended on her office and began to gather up files, boxes, reports, and such. She just stood, shocked, before she was able to find her voice once more.  
葛城美里简直不知所措。前一刻她还在和加持通话处理一些文书工作，下一刻一大群 NERV 人员涌入她的办公室，开始收集文件、箱子、报告等。她只是站在那里，震惊不已，直到她终于找回了自己的声音。

"Kaji, what's happening here?" she blurted out, as drones continued to see to there tasks, oblivious to her outburst. Commander Ikari had given them their orders, and they were definitely going to carry them out.  
“加持，这里发生了什么？”她脱口而出，无人机继续执行任务，对她的激动毫不在意。碇司令已经下达了指令，它们肯定会执行到底。

"You're asking me, doll?" Kaji replied as he scooted out of the way of a swiftly moving drone. "I'm just as much in the dark as you."  
“你问我，我问谁？”加持一边回答，一边迅速避开一架快速移动的无人机。“我和你一样一头雾水。”

"Bullshit," Misato snorted, knowing the man was up to something.  
“胡扯，”美里嗤之以鼻，她知道这家伙肯定在搞什么鬼。

"However, I wonder if this has to do with…" he started.  
“不过，我在想这是否和……”他开口道。

"Knock, knock," a familiar voice called out, as Shinji walked in and took a seat on the other side of the desk from Misato. Kaji threw him a mock salute, which Shinji returned before stripping off the gloves and glasses. "I hope to God to never have to do that again!" He blew out a long, relaxing breath.  
“咚咚咚，”一个熟悉的声音喊道，真嗣走了进来，在美里办公桌的对面坐下。加持向他抛了个假敬礼，真嗣回敬后摘下手套和眼镜。“我真希望再也不用做那种事了！”他长长地舒了一口气。

"I take it the meeting went well?" Kaji grinned as Shinji couldn't hide the pleasure on his face.  
“看来会议进行得不错？”加持笑着问，真嗣脸上的喜悦藏都藏不住。

"Can't you tell?" he gestured at the slowly thinning crowd. "They should have your new office ready in an hour or so, Misato."  
“你没看出来吗？”他指了指逐渐散去的人群，“他们应该会在一小时内把你的新办公室准备好，美里。”

"New office?," she asked suspiciously, crossing her arms and raising an eyebrow. Kaji reached over and pinched her butt, breaking the serious pose. Shinji snickered.  
“新办公室？”她怀疑地问道，交叉双臂，扬起眉毛。加持伸手捏了捏她的屁股，打破了严肃的气氛。真嗣窃笑起来。

"Yep! New office, and this to go with it," he added as he tossed a set of car keys to Misato. "Company car. The Commander said something about 'reliable transportation', and 'death trap'"  
“没错！新办公室，还有这个配套，”他说着将一串车钥匙扔给美里。“公司配车。司令提到了什么‘可靠的交通工具’，还有‘死亡陷阱’。”

"Guess you expect to drive my old one, then?" she teased, getting ready to toss Shinji her own set.  
“猜你是想开我那辆旧车吧？”她打趣道，准备把自己的钥匙扔给真嗣。

"Uh, actually, it's a matching set," he replied as he produced his own set, enjoying the shocked looks on both of their faces.  
“呃，实际上，这是一对配套的，”他边说边拿出自己的那串钥匙，享受着他们脸上惊讶的表情。

"Just how the hell did you manage that?" Misato gasped. She had been trying to get The Old Man to cough one up for years, and now there were two.  
“你到底是怎么做到的？”美里惊呼。她多年来一直试图让老头子给她配辆车，现在居然一下子有了两辆。

"He claimed it was 'to help look secure the welfare of the pilots and the unborn child.' Something to do with your driving, I think." Shinji said with a wide teasing grin on his face. Kaji smirked as Misato fumed. She _hated_ being teased. "But seriously…"  
“他声称这是‘为了确保飞行员和未出生孩子的福祉’。好像和你开车有关，我想。” 真嗣带着一脸戏谑的笑容说道。加持微微一笑，而美里则气得直冒烟。她讨厌被戏弄。“但说真的……”

About that time, a new drone arrived and removed the board on the desk stating 'Director of Operations' and replaced it with one stating 'Commander, Combat Groups'. Shinji's eyes widened somewhat as he saw that. He hadn't expected an office, to go with the rest. Misato snatched it up and scowled fiercely. Kaji took a step back.  
就在那时，一架新无人机抵达，移走了桌上写着“运营总监”的牌子，换上了一个写着“战斗群指挥官”的新牌子。真嗣的眼睛微微睁大，他没想到还会有办公室。美里一把抓起牌子，怒气冲冲地瞪着。加持退后了一步。

"Who the hell is that? What in the world is going on here?" she yelled, quite flustered. It was then that Kaji noticed Shinji's lapel, and opened his mouth to say something, but was cut off.  
“那人到底是谁？这里到底发生了什么？”她气急败坏地大喊。这时，加持注意到真嗣的翻领，正要开口说些什么，却被打断了。

"Captain Ikari!" a young female voice rang out down the hallway. Shinji stood up just in time to be caught up in a huge hug by a small, dark haired girl, looking little older than Shinji himself  
“一尉真嗣！”一个年轻女孩的声音在走廊里响起。真嗣刚站起来，就被一个黑发的小女孩紧紧抱住，那女孩看起来和真嗣差不多大。

"Captain Ikari?!" Misato yelped, utterly stunned.  
"碇司令？！" 美里惊呼道，完全愣住了。

"Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!" the girl squealed as Shinji did his best to extract himself from the hug before he would pass out.  
"谢谢，谢谢，谢谢，谢谢！" 女孩尖叫着，真嗣尽力从拥抱中挣脱出来，以免自己晕过去。

"Welcome…Mariko…can't…breath…" he gasped as the young NERV tech relaxed her grip, blushing severely.  
"欢迎……麻里子……我……喘不过气了……" 他喘息着，年轻的 NERV 技术员放松了她的拥抱，满脸通红。

_"Crap! It looks like Asuka's got some competition. Damn, she's cute, too!"_ Misato thought as she sized up the newcomer. "Aren't you Commander Ikari's secretary?"  
糟糕！看来明日香有了竞争对手。该死，她也挺可爱的！" 美里打量着新来者心想。"你不就是碇司令的秘书吗？

"Yes ma'am, but he was going to fire me, until Captain Ikari put in a good word for me! This means so much to me and my little brother. This job is the only way we can pay the bills!"  
是的，女士，但他本来要解雇我，直到碇队长为我美言了几句！这对我和我弟弟意义重大。这份工作是我们支付账单的唯一途径！

"Ah! Shinji the hero to the rescue!" Kaji teased, causing Shinji to blush. "_Amazing! After facing down his father, he can still blush!"_  
啊！救星真嗣来救援了！" 加持调侃道，让真嗣脸红了。"太神奇了！面对他父亲之后，他还能脸红！

"Uh, it was my fault she was terminated. I was able to get my father to reassign her as someone's assistant."  
呃，她被解雇是我的错。我设法让父亲把她重新分配为某人的助理。

"She wouldn't happen to be yours?" Kaji asked, amused and just a little concerned. The girl was cute and looking to Shinji with such gratitude. She wasn't much older than he was.  
"她不会正好是你的吧？" 加持问道，既觉得有趣又略感担忧。那个女孩很可爱，用如此感激的眼神看着真嗣。她比他大不了多少。

"Nope, actually she's now hers," Shinji replied with a grin as Misato's jaw dropped again. _"It is such a treat to find the Major speechless, for once,"_ he mused. "Misato, this is Technician Third Class Mariko Toranaga. Mariko, this is Major Misato Katsuragi, Director of Operations."  
不，实际上她现在属于她自己了，" 真嗣笑着回答，让美里再次惊讶得下巴都掉了下来。"能看到美里少校无言以对，真是难得的乐趣，" 他暗自思忖。"美里，这位是三等技术员 Mariko Toranaga。Mariko，这位是负责运营的葛城美里少校。

"Pleased to meet you, Mariko, " Misato said as she shook the young woman's hand. Mariko just beamed.  
"很高兴见到你，Mariko，" 美里说着握住了年轻女子的手。Mariko 只是灿烂地笑了。

"You too, Major! The Captain told me all about you when he briefed me on my new assignment," Mariko gushed. Misato cocked an eyebrow toward Shinji, who just shrugged.  
"我也是，少校！上尉在给我介绍新任务时，把你的事都告诉我了，" Mariko 兴奋地说。美里向真嗣扬了扬眉毛，真嗣只是耸了耸肩。

"Have you eaten yet, Mariko?" Misato asked as the young girl nodded her head. "Okay! Well, if you wouldn't mind, could you find my new office and start setting everything up? Come find me in the cafeteria in an hour so you can show me where it is. This was a bit sudden," she said with a sigh.  
"Mariko，你吃过饭了吗？" 美里问道，年轻女孩点了点头。"好的！那么，如果你不介意的话，能不能先找到我的新办公室并开始整理一下？一小时后到食堂来找我，带我去看看。这有点突然，" 她叹了口气说。

"Yes ma'am!" the girl chirped and followed the last of the techs, leaving a bare office with no sign of it's previous owner.  
“是的，女士！”女孩欢快地应道，跟着最后一位技术人员离开了，留下一个空荡荡的办公室，不见前任主人的任何踪迹。

"Come on, you two!" Misato said as she grabbed both men by the arm and dragged them out of the office. "We need to talk!"  
“快点，你们两个！”美里说着，抓住两人的手臂，把他们拽出了办公室。“我们有话要谈！”

"What did we do?" they protested in unison, causing Misato to growl and increase her grip on their arms, causing both to wince as they were marched down the hall.  
“我们做了什么？”他们异口同声地抗议，这让美里咆哮起来，她加大了抓握力度，两人疼得皱眉，被她拖着走过走廊。

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Okay, I take it this all has something to do with Shinji's meeting with his father," Misato fumed as she sat her tray down with a clatter, as the two men in her life joined her. "However, the first thing I want to know is: who is this Commander, Combat Groups? Sounds like they're trying to take my job! I've done a good job, damn it! Why should someone come in and try to replace me? Got any ideas, Kaji?"  
“好吧，我猜这一切都和真嗣与他父亲的会面有关，”美里气愤地将餐盘砰地一声放下，她生命中的两个男人也加入了她。“不过，我首先想知道的是：这个指挥官，战斗小组是怎么回事？听起来他们想抢我的工作！我做得很好，该死的！为什么有人要进来试图取代我？有什么想法吗，加持？”

"Not a one, Major. Perhaps if you ask the Captain…?" the older man replied.  
"一个都没有，少校。或许你可以问问上尉……？" 年长的男人回答道。

Shinji almost choked on his drink before he could answer, shooting Kaji a dirty look. "Um, well, I mean, uh, I guess that would be me?" he stammered as the older couple sat in shocked silence. Kaji recovered first and congratulated Shinji.  
真嗣差点被饮料呛到，还没来得及回答，就狠狠地瞪了加持一眼。"呃，嗯，我是说，呃，我想那应该是我吧？" 他结结巴巴地说，而那对年长的夫妇则震惊地坐在那里。加持最先回过神来，向真嗣表示祝贺。

"I know you said you wanted to take of us, Shinji, but taking my job isn't the answer!" she seethed a Kaji put a hand on her shoulder to calm her.  
"我知道你说过你想照顾我们，真嗣，但接手我的工作可不是办法！" 她气愤地说，加持把手放在她的肩膀上试图让她平静下来。

"It's not like that Misato!" Shinji protested, waving his hands in front of him. "You're still my boss! You still have your job…"  
不是那样的，美里！" 真嗣抗议道，双手在他面前挥舞着。"你仍然是我的上司！你的工作还在……

"The Commander thought it prudent to put an experienced combat pilot in charge of the active forces during a battle," another voice added as he took his place at their table. All three gaped at Commander Fuyutsuki as he proceeded to partake in lunch. He never ate in the cafeteria before, as far as they knew. "Major Katsuragi is still the operations director, and in over all charge of any and all operations. Captain Ikari's roll is to act as an extra set of eyes on the battlefield, and direct any attacks to any opportunity he may see. He is your backup, Major, your right hand man. Not your replacement."  
“指挥官认为在战斗中让一位经验丰富的战斗飞行员负责指挥现役部队是明智之举，”另一个声音补充道，他一边说着一边在他们桌旁坐下。三人目瞪口呆地看着 Fuyutsuki 指挥官开始用餐。据他们所知，他以前从未在食堂吃过饭。“葛城美少校仍然是作战主任，全面负责所有行动。碇司令的角色是在战场上充当额外的眼睛，指导任何他可能发现的攻击机会。他是你的后援，美少校，你的得力助手。并非取代你。”

"Oh," came Misato's reply, a bit shamefaced at jumping to conclusions, again.  
“哦，”美理回答道，再次急于下结论而感到有些羞愧。

"Much to the Captain's credit, he never asked for any rank or position," Fuyutsuki continued, "in fact the only thing he really asked for himself was an increase in his allowance and pay, as well as those of yourself and the other three pilots."  
“值得称赞的是，碇司令从未要求过任何军衔或职位，”Fuyutsuki 继续说道，“事实上，他唯一为自己争取的是增加津贴和薪水，包括你和其他三位驾驶员的。”

"Three pilots?" came Misato's startled reply. The only other pilot before was…  
“三位驾驶员？”美理惊讶地回应。之前唯一的另一位驾驶员是……

"Touji volunteered to pilot Unit Two while Asuka's on leave. With modifications to the DPS, he can pilot it with no problems," Shinji added as he munched on a rice ball.  
"冬二自愿在明日香休假期间驾驶二号机。经过对 DPS 的改装，他驾驶起来毫无问题，" 真嗣边说边嚼着饭团。

"The Commander asked for one thing in return to answering Shinji's requests: That he take the rank of Captain and assumed the CCG position. He still must go to school, but on Summer vacation, he must come in and work a full shift every weekday. He is to also join you every once in a while to learn necessary procedures and protocols.  
指挥官在回应真嗣的请求时提出一个条件：他必须接受上尉军衔并承担 CCG 职位。尽管仍需上学，但在暑假期间，他必须每周一到周五全天工作。他还需不时与你一同学习必要的程序和协议。

He is to be your backup as well. If you are indisposed or incapacitated in any way, the Captain will take command.  
他也将作为你的后备。若你因任何原因无法履职，这位上尉将接管指挥权。

"Gendo said if Shinji was ready to assume a man's responsibilities, then he could assume a man's employment. It greatly increased his pay, as well his housing allotment. Between Shinji's, Asuka's and yours, Major, you can move into much larger living quarters, per the Captain's request." Fuyutsuki told Misato, who still hadn't touched her meal yet.  
"源渡表示，如果真嗣准备好承担成年人的责任，那么他也可以接受成年人的工作。这大大提高了他的薪酬，以及住房补贴。在真嗣、明日香和你的共同努力下，少校，你们可以搬进更大的住所，这是上尉的请求。" 副司令冬月对还未动筷的美里说道。

"So, I take it Asuka's staying in Japan, then?" Kaji asked, grinning at his protégé.  
"这么说，明日香是留在日本了？" 加持笑着问他的徒弟。

"Yes, she is. The Commander and I came to an…understanding," Shinji said with an evil grin. Fuyutsuki chuckled.  
"是的，她会留下。司令和我达成了……共识，" 真嗣带着一丝邪笑说道。冬月轻声笑了起来。

"I can tell you this, Shinji. I am very proud at how you handled your father. There are not many people on this planet who can stand up to Gendo Ikari and live to tell the tale, let alone get what they want. Good job, son!" the older man said as he picked up his tray and bid them good day. All three just sat there in silence.  
"我可以告诉你，真嗣，我对你如何应对你父亲感到非常自豪。在这个星球上，没有多少人能面对碇源堂还能活着讲述经过，更不用说得到他们想要的东西了。干得好，孩子！" 年长者说着拿起托盘，向他们道别。三个人只是静静地坐在那里。

"Uh, Shinji," Misato finally was able to ask, as her appetite slowly came back to her, "what all did you request from the Commander?" Shinji ran off the list of items and why he asked for them. Right then and there, she knew he had grown up. He hadn't asked for anything extraneous or extravagant, only what he needed to support and tend to his family.  
"呃，真嗣，" 美里终于能开口问道，她的食欲慢慢恢复了，"你向司令提出了什么要求？" 真嗣一一列举了他请求的物品及其原因。就在那一刻，她知道他长大了。他没有要求任何多余或奢侈的东西，只是为了支持并照顾他的家人所需。

"So, why did the Commander really offer you and Misato a car each?" Kaji asked nonchalantly, as he took a sip of his tea. Seeing Shinji sitting there, Kaji had the subconscious desire to straighten and tighten his own tie, so as not to be outdone by the younger man. He fought it though, and as usual, won.  
"那么，司令官为什么会真的分别给你们和美里一辆车呢？" 加持随意地问道，同时抿了一口茶。看到真嗣坐在那里，加持下意识地想要整理并收紧自己的领带，以免被这位年轻人比下去。但他还是忍住了，一如既往地赢了。

"Yeah, it's not like him to consider the welfare of others, and Fuyutsuki said you didn't ask for it. So, what's up?" Misato was curious.  
"是啊，他可不像是会考虑别人福祉的人，而且副司令说你并没有要求。所以，到底怎么回事？" 美里好奇地问。

Cursing under his breath, Shinji took a deep breath. "I sold my bike."  
真嗣低声咒骂着，深吸了一口气。"我把我的自行车卖了。"

"WHAT?!" Misato screamed , causing others in the cafeteria to look her way. A look from her told everyone else that this was none of their business. Kaji just sat back and smiled. "Are you nuts? Why?"  
什么？！" 美里尖叫起来，引得食堂里其他人纷纷侧目。她一个眼神就让所有人明白这事儿与他们无关。加持只是坐在一旁，微笑着。"你疯了吗？为什么？

"Well, this suit wasn't cheap, Misato," Shinji said as he finished off his drink, "and neither were the dinner reservations I made for Asuka and myself."  
“唉，这件西装可不便宜，美里，”真嗣喝完饮料说道，“还有我为明日香和我自己订的晚餐位子也是。”

"Come on, Shinji, spill it!" Kaji urged, guessing what was next. Misato shot him a quizzical look.  
“快说吧，真嗣，别卖关子了！”加持催促道，猜到了接下来的事。美里疑惑地看了他一眼。

"And, uh, this was worth it…" Shinji stammered as he pulled a small object from his pocket and placed it on the table for his two friends to see. Misato's eyes shone with tears as she looked at it, then glanced at Kaji. Kaji looked visibly nervous, like it was a deadly cobra ready to strike.  
“而且，呃，这都值得……”真嗣结巴着从口袋里掏出一个小物件，放在桌上让两位朋友看。美里看着它，眼中闪烁着泪光，然后瞥了眼加持。加持显得很紧张，仿佛那是一条随时准备攻击的致命眼镜蛇。

"Oh, Shinji…" “哦，真嗣……”

"There were three parts to my plan. First was securing Asuka and the baby's future. Second was to provide security for our family. The third," Shinji gulped, "is the hardest part of all. To tell the truth, I'm scared shitless. Tonight, one way or another, everything is going to change…"  
我的计划分为三个部分。首先是确保明日香和孩子的未来。第二是为我们的家庭提供安全保障。第三部分，" 真嗣咽了口唾沫，"是最难的。说实话，我吓得要命。今晚，无论如何，一切都将改变……

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Asuka, Rei, and Hikari were talking amongst themselves as they left the school when they saw a crowd of girls surrounding a sleek black car. The driver of the car leaned against the front fender, doing his best to answer their questions. He seemed to be trying to ignore the girls without hurting their feelings. The driver was wearing a black suit with a red tie, which nicely matched the red sunglasses he wore.  
明日香、丽和光在离开学校时，看到一群女生围着一辆光滑的黑色轿车。司机靠在前挡泥板上，尽力回答她们的问题。他似乎在努力不伤害她们感情的情况下忽视她们。司机穿着黑色西装，系着红色领带，与他的红色太阳镜很相配。

_"Damn, he looks hot!"_ Asuka thought to herself, before feeling a little ashamed at the thought. Her heart belonged to Shinji, whether either one of them knew it or not. She saw Hikari whisper something to Rei, as both girls broke into giggles. Asuka realized she was blushing, and she was sure the others had seen it.  
"该死，他看起来真帅！" 明日香心想，随即感到一丝羞愧。她的心属于真嗣，无论他们是否意识到。她看到光对丽低语了几句，两个女孩都笑了起来。明日香意识到自己脸红了，她确信其他人也看到了。

"Okay, you two! Just what is so damn funny?" she demanded as the other two kept giggling, infuriating her further.  
"好了，你们两个！到底有什么好笑的？" 她质问道，另外两人继续笑着，让她更加恼火。

"But Asuka," Hikari teased, "isn't that guy with the car just so cute?" Rei kept giggling.  
“但是明日香，”光调侃道，“那个开车的家伙不是很可爱吗？”丽继续咯咯笑着。

"What? Are you nuts? Just because he's got a cool car doesn't make him cute! I bet he's just a big…." Asuka was saying until she faltered. The driver was walking toward them now, much to the dismay of the crowd. His glasses slipped down his nose, and looking over them were the deepest, most adorable set of blue eyes she had ever seen. "Shinji?"  
“什么？你疯了吗？就因为他有辆酷车不代表他可爱！我打赌他只是个大……”明日香正说着，突然停住了。司机现在正朝她们走来，这让围观的人群感到不安。他的眼镜滑到了鼻梁上，透过镜片望去，是一双她见过的最深邃、最迷人的蓝眼睛。“真嗣？”

"M'lady, your chariot awaits," he said with a flourish that would have made Kaji proud. Asuka stood there in shock, as the crowd of girls began to depart and give Asuka a wide array of dirty looks. Shinji took Asuka by the hand and lead her to the car.  
“女士，您的马车等候多时了，”他用一种会让加持感到自豪的夸张动作说道。明日香站在那里震惊不已，周围的女孩们开始散去，并向明日香投来各种不友好的目光。真嗣牵起明日香的手，带她走向汽车。

"What? How? Who's car is that?" she stammered.  
“什么？怎么回事？那是谁的车？”她结结巴巴地问。

"Come, I'll explain on the way," he said as he opened the door for her.  
“来吧，我边走边解释，”他说着为她打开了门。

"Asuka, thank you for allowing Shinji to take us home," Rei said from the backseat as Shinji drove through the streets of Tokyo-3. They had just dropped Hikari off at her home.  
“明日香，谢谢你让真嗣送我们回家，”绫波坐在后座上说道，真嗣正驾驶着车穿过第三新东京市的街道。他们刚刚把光送到了她家。

"No sweat, Rei! What are friends for?" Asuka replied. Even though she and Rei had never gotten along real well in the past, the past couple of days have shown an amazing change. The two girls had a long talk about life, especially babies, and Shinji. Rei took the idea of protecting and helping Asuka seriously. She also looked forward to being an aunt.  
“小事一桩，绫波！朋友之间不就是这样吗？”明日香回答道。尽管她和绫波过去相处得并不太好，但最近几天发生了惊人的变化。两位女孩就生活，特别是关于孩子和真嗣，进行了一次长谈。绫波认真地接受了保护和帮助明日香的想法。她也期待着成为一名姑姑。

Asuka glanced at the man sitting beside her, escorting her throughout the city. Shinji explained everything that had happened that day to them all as he drove. While she wasn't too happy about Touji piloting Unit Two, she understood the reason. The rest made her as happy as a clam.  
明日香瞥了一眼坐在她旁边，陪她穿梭于城市中的男人。真嗣一边开车一边向他们所有人解释了那天发生的一切。虽然她对剑介驾驶二号机并不太高兴，但她理解其中的原因。其他的事情让她感到非常开心。

"It shouldn't take too long for NERV personnel to have our new living quarters ready, Rei. You may want to pack and be ready to go when they arrive. It might take a couple of days, max.," Shinji said as he pulled in front of the rundown apartment complex she called home.  
"NERV 的人员应该不会花太长时间就能准备好我们的新住处，绫波。你可能需要收拾一下，等他们来的时候随时可以出发。最多也就几天时间。" 真嗣说着，把车停在了她称之为家的破旧公寓楼前。

"Shinji, I …don't know what to say," Rei said softly as she leaned forward and gave her brother a kiss on the cheek.  
"真嗣，我……不知道该说什么，" 绫波轻声说道，身体前倾，在哥哥的脸颊上轻轻一吻。

"Well, say 'thank you'! Duh!" Asuka said with a smirk as Rei turned and gave her an over-the-seat hug.  
"那就说‘谢谢’啊！真是的！" 明日香带着一丝戏谑地说道，绫波转过身来，隔着座位给了她一个拥抱。

"You don't mind me moving in next door?" Rei asked.  
"你介意我搬到你隔壁吗？" 绫波问道。

"I don't mind, Rei. After all, we're all family, and family needs to be close and look out for one another," Asuka replied. She knew Shinji wanted to look out for his sister, as well as have her close in case anything happens to herself or the baby. The idea of Shinji thinking of them all as family was really heartwarming.  
“我不介意，丽。毕竟，我们是一家人，家人之间需要亲近并互相照顾，”明日香回答道。她知道真嗣想照顾他的妹妹，也想让她在身边以防自己或宝宝有什么意外。真嗣把他们都当作家人的想法真的很暖心。

"Alright, mister," Asuka growled as Shinji pulled away from Rei's place, "What the hell were all those girls doing crowding around you when I came out? Hmm?"  
“好吧，先生，”明日香咆哮着，当真嗣从丽的地方离开时，“我出来的时候，那些女孩围着你干什么？嗯？”

"Relax Asuka," Shinji said, somewhat nervously, "they were just asking about the car. That's all."  
“放松点，明日香，”真嗣有些紧张地说，“她们只是问起车的事。仅此而已。”

"Bullshit!" she seethed, "You mean to tell me that even though you stood there looking all cool and sexy, that those tramps were just interested in the car?!"  
“胡说！”她怒斥道，“你是想说，尽管你站在那里看起来又酷又性感，那些女人只是对车感兴趣？！”

Shinji almost drove off the road in surprise at what Asuka just admitted. _"She thinks that of me? Wow!"_  
真嗣差点因为明日香刚刚承认的事情惊讶得把车开到路外。“她对我有这样的看法？哇！”

"_Aw crap, did I just say that? Damn hormones!!"_ she thought, blushing beyond belief. "Hey watch it, you idiot! Are you trying to kill us?"  
“糟糕，我刚才是不是说了那话？该死的荷尔蒙！！”她想，脸红得无法置信。“嘿，小心点，你这个白痴！你想害死我们吗？”

"Sorry! Pothole," he lied, hoping that Asuka wouldn't see how flustered he was. Being so flustered herself, she didn't notice.  
“对不起！有个坑，”他撒谎道，希望明日香不会看出他有多慌张。她自己也慌得没注意到。

"Like I said, Asuka, relax!" Shinji reasoned with her, as he started feeling a bit crest fallen, "No one in their right minds would ever think that of me. I'm just plain old boring Shinji," he said a bit sadly. It broke her heart, for him to feel so down about himself.  
“就像我说的，明日香，放松点！”真嗣劝她，同时开始感到有些沮丧，“没有人会那样看我的。我只是个普通的无聊真嗣，”他有些悲伤地说。他如此贬低自己，让她心都碎了。

"I do," she said softly, as she reached over and patted his leg. She saw him blush, but his face still lit up brighter than she had ever seen it before. She was blushing as they pulled into the parking lot of their building. _"Damn, he does look sexy!"_ she mused as he came around and opened her door. The two teenagers walked hand in hand to their apartment  
“我愿意，”她轻声说道，伸手拍了拍他的腿。她看到他脸红了，但他的脸比她以前见过的任何时候都要亮。当他们驶入大楼的停车场时，她也在脸红。“该死，他看起来真性感！”她心里想着，当他绕过来为她开门时。两个少年手牵手走向他们的公寓。

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.

"Asuka, are you done yet?" Shinji asked her through her bedroom door. He had finished Misato and Pen-pen's dinner and had it in the refrigerator for them. Now he waited for Asuka to finish. And waited, and waited.  
“Asuka，你好了吗？”真嗣隔着她的卧室门问道。他已经为美里和 Pen-pen 做好了晚餐，并放进了冰箱。现在他等着 Asuka 完成。等啊等，等啊等。

"Hold your horses! You can't rush perfection, you know!" she called back as he shook his head and sighed.  
“别急！你知道的，完美是不能被催促的！”她回喊道，他摇头叹息。

"You can't improve on it either!" he replied, having the desired effect. She slid her door open and looked at him with dreamy eyes.  
“你也改不了它！”他回答道，效果达到了。她滑开门，用梦幻般的眼睛看着他。

"Really?" she beamed, a beautiful smile on her face.  
"真的吗？" 她笑容灿烂，脸上洋溢着美丽的微笑。

"_Wow!"_ he thought as she stood before him. She had her hair pulled up on one side, coming up above and behind her ear, as the other side hung loose. Asuka wore a red dress that fit her perfectly. It was slightly pleated and came to just above her knees, and while the sleeves were long, they left her shoulders bare. Her tan hose and red heels completed the outfit perfectly. "Really! You are so beautiful!" he replied, awestruck.  
"哇！" 他心中惊叹，当她站在他面前时。她的头发一边高高束起，越过耳后，另一边则自然垂落。明日香穿着一件红色连衣裙，完美贴合她的身形，略带褶皱，长度刚好过膝，虽然袖子很长，但露出了她的肩膀。她的棕色丝袜和红色高跟鞋完美地搭配了整套装扮。"真的！你太美了！" 他惊叹地回答。

"Good! I wouldn't have it any other way!" she said as she took his arm. When he had told her that he had made dinner reservations for the two of them that evening, it came as a total shock. She couldn't understand what had happened to Shinji, but for the most part, the changes were for the better. She knew which dress to wear, because she had bought it a couple of months back, in case he had ever got enough courage up to ask her out. "So, where are we going?"  
太好了！我可不想有别的选择！" 她说着挽起他的手臂。当他告诉她晚上已经为他们俩预订了晚餐时，这完全出乎她的意料。她不明白真嗣发生了什么变化，但大部分改变都是好的。她知道该穿哪件裙子，因为她几个月前就买了它，以防他终于鼓起勇气约她出去。"那么，我们去哪儿？

"You know that restaurant you keep telling me that you're wanting to try?" he asked with a smile as he led her out the door.  
"你知道那家你一直跟我说想尝试的餐厅吗？" 他微笑着问道，一边领她出门。

" _The Skyline_? No way!" she gasped.  
“天际线？不可能！”她倒抽一口气。

"Way!" he said as he closed the door.  
“当然！”他说着关上了门。

"Warrk?" Pen-Pen said, watching the young couple leave, and hoping that Misato would come home and _not_ forget about his dinner.  
“呱？”企鹅 Pen-Pen 看着年轻情侣离去，心中期盼 Misato 回家时别忘了给它准备晚餐。

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"May I help you?" the host asked haughtily as Shinji and Asuka stood before him.  
“有什么能帮到您的吗？”主人傲慢地问，看着站在面前的真嗣和明日香。

"Ikari, party of two," Shinji replied smoothly.  
"两位，伊卡里家。" 真嗣流畅地回答道。

_"He must be taking Kaji lessons,"_ Asuka mused.  
"他肯定是在跟加持学这些。" 明日香暗自思忖。

"I'm sorry, but we don't serve _children_ here," came the drab reply. Asuka was stunned, as tears started to form in her eyes.  
"抱歉，我们这里不接待儿童。" 对方冷淡地回应。明日香愣住了，泪水开始在眼眶中打转。

"Please check again. It's under Captain Ikari," Shinji replied calmly.  
"请再核实一下，预订人是伊卡里上尉。" 真嗣平静地回答。

"Sir, making reservations in your father's name and bringing a date does not count, and reeks of betrayed trust. Please leave now."  
先生，用您父亲的名字预订并带一位约会对象来，这不算数，而且有悖信任。请现在离开。

"Now, wait a second here!" Asuka started to complain loudly, when a second man arrived on the scene, having been summoned by the first.  
"等等，这是怎么回事！" 明日香大声抱怨起来，这时第二个人出现了，是被第一个人叫来的。

"Is there a problem here?" the newcomer asked, and before the host could reply, Shinji cut him off.  
"这里有什么问题吗？" 新来者问道，还没等主人回答，真嗣就打断了他。

"Are the manager, sir?" Shinji asked politely, much too politely for Asuka's taste, and drawing a searing look from the host.  
"请问您是经理吗？" 真嗣礼貌地问道，礼貌得让明日香觉得过分，也让主人投来了尖锐的目光。

"Yes, sir. My name is Thomas Sky, and I own and manage _The Skyline._ How may I help you?" Shinji took Thomas over to the side.  
"是的，先生。我叫托马斯·斯凯，是天际线的老板兼经理。有什么可以帮您的？" 真嗣把托马斯带到一旁。

"Yes, sir. My name is Captain Shinji Ikari," Shinji said as he handed his NERV ID and his business card to Thomas, "Commander of Combat Groups and designated pilot of Evangelion Unit One. In case you are wondering what that is, it is the rather large purple and green EVA that has saved this city time and time again."  
是的，先生。我是碇真嗣上尉，" 真嗣说着递上了他的 NERV 身份证和名片，"战斗小组的指挥官，也是初号机指定驾驶员。如果您好奇那是什么，它是多次拯救这座城市的紫色和绿色大型 EVA。

"Yes, sir," Thomas said with a gulp. He had seen the EVA in action before, and heard much of it's young pilot.  
"是的，先生，" 托马斯咽了口唾沫。他之前见过 EVA 的行动，也听说过这位年轻驾驶员的事迹。

"I called up here earlier in the day and made reservations for this evening. Now, do you see that lovely young lady right there?" he said, motioning to Asuka.  
"我今天早些时候打电话预订了今晚的位置。现在，您看到那边那位可爱的年轻女士了吗？" 他说着指向明日香。

"Yes, sir. She's very beautiful," the manager replied, still a little shaken by standing next to the young man who could make a giant dance on a dime. Shinji's NERV ID didn't help much.  
“是的，先生。她非常美丽，”经理回答道，站在能让巨人在一分钱上跳舞的年轻人旁边，他仍有些心有余悸。真嗣的 NERV ID 也没帮上什么忙。

"Indeed. She is very near and dear to me, and tonight is to be a special evening for her. I would hate to see it ruined because one man thought we were not good enough to dine here. It might not be good for business if NERV personnel aren't welcome here." Thomas went pale.  
“确实如此。她对我来说非常亲近，今晚对她意义非凡。我不希望因为一个人认为我们不配在这里用餐而毁了这一切。如果 NERV 的人员在这里不受欢迎，那对生意可能不太好。”托马斯脸色发白。

"Understood sir! If you like, dinner will be on the house tonight for all that you have done for us," the manager said with genuine respect. Anyone who would fight against the giant monsters that kept attacking was a hero in his book.  
“明白了，先生！如果您愿意，今晚的晚餐将由我们请客，以感谢您为我们所做的一切，”经理真诚地说道。在他看来，那些与不断袭击的巨型怪兽战斗的人都是英雄。

"That is most generous," Shinji said in thanks, as he and Thomas returned to Asuka.  
“这真是太慷慨了，”真嗣感激地说，随后他和托马斯回到了明日香身边。

"Not a problem! In fact, I believe our best table is ready as we speak," the manager replied as he motioned toward a cozy little table for two right by the windows _The Skyline_ was known for. The view of Tokyo-3 and the mountains was perfect.  
"没问题！事实上，我相信我们最好的桌子已经准备好了，"经理一边说一边指向窗户旁一张温馨的小桌，这里是观赏东京-3 和群山的绝佳位置。

"Maurice, you are to go home for the rest of the evening," Thomas said as he led Shinji and Asuka to their table.  
"莫里斯，你今晚可以回家休息了，"托马斯说着，带领真嗣和明日香走向他们的桌子。

"But, sir! Who is to work my place tonight?" the host protested until a look from Thomas shut him down. "Yes, sir."  
但是，先生！今晚谁来接替我的岗位？"接待员抗议道，直到托马斯的一个眼神让他闭嘴。"是的，先生。

"I'll take care of my guests tonight, since you seem to lack the desire to do so!" Thomas shot back. He showed the couple to the table, where Shinji held Asuka's chair for her as gentleman should. "I'll send my best waiter over as soon as possible to take your order."  
今晚我会亲自照顾我的客人，既然你似乎缺乏这种意愿！"托马斯回敬道。他带这对情侣到桌前，真嗣像绅士一样为明日香拉开椅子。"我会尽快派最好的服务员过来帮你们点餐。

"Thank you, Mr. Sky," Asuka said with gratitude. "This is a lovely place you…oh my!" she gasped as she looked out the window for the first time.  
"谢谢你，Sky 先生，" 明日香感激地说道。"这个地方真美……哦，天哪！" 她第一次望向窗外时惊叹道。

"Breathtaking, isn't it?," Thomas said at her reaction, smiling. "Please, call me 'Thomas'. If there is anything you need, please let me know." With that, the manager left the two teens alone.  
"很震撼吧？" 托马斯看到她的反应，微笑着说，"请叫我'托马斯'。如果有什么需要，请告诉我。" 说完，经理让两个少年独自留在那里。

"The view is absolutely beautiful," Asuka beamed as she looked out the windows and over the bright lights of Tokyo-3, with the mountains in the background. It was like it was specially crafted to get hearts going.  
"景色真是美极了，" 明日香望着窗外的东京-3 璀璨灯火和远处的山峦，笑容满面。仿佛是专为打动人心而设计的。

"Yes, it is," Shinji replied, not look out, but rather toward the woman he loved. To see her so happy and alive was all he could ask for. She turned and saw him staring. Asuka blushed.  
"是啊，确实很美，" 真嗣回答，没有望向窗外，而是看向了他所爱的女人。看到她如此快乐和充满活力，他别无所求。她转过头，发现他在凝视自己。明日香脸红了。

"Quit that! Your going to get sap all over your suit!" she teased, as she playfully slapped at him. He just sat and laughed, drawing giggles from her.  
“快停下！你会把树液弄得满身都是！”她打趣道，一边笑着轻轻拍打他。他只是坐着大笑，逗得她也咯咯笑起来。

Thomas made good his promise, as the waiter that helped them was very professional and experienced, and served them warmly. He complemented the couple on their appearance and their choice of dinner, and made sure he personally took care of anything they needed. By the time the evening was over, he and the couple laughed and joked like they were old friends. Shinji made sure to leave him a large tip, as well as a recommendation of a raise in pay.  
托马斯兑现了他的承诺，那位帮助他们的服务员非常专业且经验丰富，热情地为他们服务。他称赞了这对夫妇的着装和晚餐选择，并确保亲自照顾他们的所有需求。到了晚上结束时，他和这对夫妇像老朋友一样谈笑风生。真嗣确保给了他一大笔小费，并推荐给他加薪。

As for Shinji and Asuka, they just enjoyed the evening and each other, letting themselves forget about the problems and troubles that had plagued them the past month. They talked about everyone and everything under the sun, neither of them becoming nervous, nor allowing any moment to become awkward. Asuka filled him in on the gossip that floated around school that day, as well as what all had been said about the two of them this past month. Shinji didn't care what was said about him, but he wouldn't allow anyone to say a cross word about Asuka. She even told him how Rei had read one girl the riot act in the classroom when she claimed Shinji was out because of what happened with Hoju. Shinji laughed at the thought of his sister standing there in class, hands on her hips, and chewing this girl out.  
至于真嗣和明日香，他们只是享受着这个夜晚，彼此相伴，让自己暂时忘却过去一个月困扰他们的问题和烦恼。他们无所不谈，既不紧张也不让任何时刻变得尴尬。明日香向他透露了那天在学校里流传的八卦，以及过去一个月里关于他们两人的种种议论。真嗣不在乎别人怎么说他，但他绝不允许任何人说一句明日香的坏话。她甚至告诉他，当一个女孩声称真嗣是因为和 Hoju 发生的事情而缺席时，丽在教室里是如何严厉训斥她的。想到自己的妹妹站在教室里，双手叉腰，对这个女孩大发雷霆的样子，真嗣忍不住笑了起来。

Asuka realized how comfortable she was with Shinji, and how she could never think of her life without him. After all, he was such a sweet guy, kind, caring, and down right good looking to boot. He seemed to be totally devoted to her, which really threw her for a loop. All in all, she was happy, and happy to be with Shinji. She looked at him, and saw the happy, content smile on his face.  
明日香意识到她和真嗣在一起是多么自在，她无法想象没有他的生活。毕竟，他是个如此温柔、体贴又帅气的人。他似乎完全专注于她，这让她感到非常意外。总的来说，她很幸福，也很高兴能和真嗣在一起。她看着他，看到了他脸上幸福满足的微笑。

All too soon, the dinner was over, and they thanked their server and Thomas. Shinji promised to tell everyone at NERV about the great time they had in his place, to which Thomas thanked them profusely. If you can get in good with NERV in this town, you're set. The two men waved to the young couple as they left the restaurant.  
晚餐结束得比预期快得多，他们向服务员和 Thomas 道谢。Shinji 承诺会在 NERV 告诉大家他们在这里度过了愉快的时光，Thomas 对此感激不尽。如果能在这座城市与 NERV 建立良好关系，那就稳妥了。这对年轻情侣离开餐厅时，两位男士向他们挥手告别。

"Well, what's next, Shinji?" Asuka wondered as the two of them strolled out of the building and onto the sidewalk. "It's still early, and I really don't want this night to end."  
“那么，接下来做什么呢，Shinji？”Asuka 边走出大楼边问道，“时间还早，我真不想今晚就这样结束。”

"Let's take a walk in the park," he said as he led her across the street. She clung to his arm as they strolled down the paths, two teenagers clearly in love. The moon was full, which lit up the park in a heavenly glow.  
“我们去公园散步吧。”他提议道，并领着她穿过街道。她挽着他的手臂，两人沿着小径漫步，显然是一对陷入爱河的少年。满月高悬，公园在月光下显得格外神圣。

"Wow, that is so beautiful," Asuka said as she looked up at the moon, it reflecting brightly in her blue eyes. Shinji looked at her and felt his heart skip a beat. The moonlight in her hair and on her face was magical.  
“哇，真是太美了。”Asuka 抬头望着月亮，她的蓝眼睛里映着明亮的光芒。Shinji 看着她，心跳不由得漏了一拍。月光洒在她的头发和脸上，宛如魔法般迷人。

"Not as beautiful as you," he said, meaning every word. She looked back at him and smirked. "I know, really sappy," he said with a grin.  
“没有你美丽，”他说，每个字都发自内心。她回头看着他，微微一笑。“我知道，真的很俗气，”他笑着说。

"Yeah, but you better not stop!" she teased, as they both started to giggle. They found a bench and sat down, holding each other, relaxing and enjoying the night. A little while later, Asuka asked, "Shinji, do you ever think about the future?"  
“是啊，但你最好别停下来！”她打趣道，两人都开始咯咯笑起来。他们找到一张长椅坐下，互相依偎，放松并享受夜晚。过了一会儿，明日香问：“真嗣，你有没有想过未来？”

"Lately, it seems that is all I think of," he replied honestly. "That was what the meeting was about today. I had to make sure your and the baby's futures were secured. I hope that didn't upset you too much, like I was overstepping my bounds."  
“最近，我似乎一直在想这件事，”他诚实地回答。“今天会议的内容就是关于这个。我必须确保你和孩子的未来得到保障。我希望这没有让你太不高兴，好像我越界了。”

"I'm not upset," Asuka answered, "I was a little surprised, but not upset. I was so used to taking care of myself before, but I can't think just about me any more. I have someone else to think of now. Besides, you promised to take care of us, and I just saw that as a part of that promise." She smiled sweetly and gratefully. Shinji saw something in her eyes, but he wasn't sure what it was.  
“我没有生气，”明日香回答，“我有点惊讶，但并不生气。我以前习惯了自己照顾自己，但现在我不能再只考虑自己了。我现在有了其他人要考虑。而且，你承诺过要照顾我们，我只是把这看作是承诺的一部分。”她甜美而感激地笑了。真嗣在她眼中看到了一些东西，但他不确定那是什么。

"That's exactly what it was," he said, glad she wasn't mad.  
“那正是它的本质，”他说，庆幸她没有生气。

"I only worry, though, about whether this is fair to you," she replied, sounding a little sad, "I mean, you have told me that you are going to take care us and never leave. But what if you find someone else, or you grow tired of me? What if you start to resent being tied to us when you want to lead your own life? I am so grateful to you, and don't want to lose you, and…and…I care for you so much, Shinji! The thought of being without you scares me, and the thought of you growing to hate me is horrible!" She started to sniff back some tears.  
“我只是担心，这对你是否公平，”她回答，声音带着一丝悲伤，“我是说，你告诉我你会照顾我们，永不离开。但如果你遇到别人，或者对我感到厌倦了呢？如果你开始怨恨被我们束缚，想要过自己的生活怎么办？我非常感激你，不想失去你，而且……我非常在乎你，真嗣！没有你的想法让我害怕，而你可能会开始恨我的想法更是可怕！”她开始忍住泪水。

"Now, now! No tears, not tonight!" he said gently as he wrapped her up in a hug. "I could never hate you, or resent you, or grow tired of you. I love you, Asuka. Never forget that!" He knelt down in front of her, looking her in eyes and taking her hands.  
“好了，好了！今晚不要哭！”他温柔地说着，将她拥入怀中。“我永远不会恨你，怨恨你，或对你感到厌倦。我爱你，明日香。永远不要忘记这一点！”他跪在她面前，注视着她的眼睛，握住她的双手。

"I want you and the baby in my life! It scares me so much that you may leave one day, after finding some guy who can take care of you two they way that you should . Some guy that will come in and sweep you off you your feet, and charm you right out of my life. I wake up at nights, with that thought in my mind. I see you next to me, and that makes it all better. I can't even think of you not being in my life. I…I never thought you would feel the same! That was a dream I never thought possible."  
我想要你和宝宝在我的生活中！你可能会在某天离开，找到一个能像你应得的那样照顾你们的人，这让我非常害怕。某个家伙会闯进来，把你从我身边夺走，用他的魅力将你从我的生活中带走。我夜里醒来，脑海中都是这个念头。我看到你在我身边，这让我感觉好多了。我甚至无法想象你不在我的生活中。我……我从未想过你会有同样的感觉！那是我从未敢奢望的梦想。

"No guy is going to come sweep me off my feet, you idiot!" she said softly and without malice. She reached up and caressed his face, "Somebody already has! I'll be with you as long as you'll have me! If you ever find someone else who can treat you like the great guy you are, I won't get in your way, even if it tears me up. I just want to be with you. I love you, Shinji Ikari!"  
没有哪个家伙会来把我从你身边夺走，你这个傻瓜！" 她温柔地说，没有一丝恶意。她伸手抚摸他的脸颊，"已经有人做到了！只要你愿意，我会一直陪在你身边！如果你找到了另一个能像对待一个了不起的人那样对待你的人，我不会妨碍你，即使这会让我心碎。我只想和你在一起。我爱你，碇真嗣！

Shinji felt like he had just been hit in the head with a hammer. _"She loves me? She really said she loves me? She wants to be with me? I have got to be dreaming!"_ He started to tremble ever so slightly as he reached a hand into his pocket and wrapped it around the small object in there.  
真嗣感觉自己像是被锤子砸中了头。"她爱我？她真的说她爱我？她想和我在一起？我一定是在做梦！" 他开始微微颤抖，伸手到口袋里，握住了里面的小物件。

"I love you, Asuka. I always have, and I always shall! I know there are better men in the world out there than I, but I can promise there is no one out there who will love you more than me. I want to spend the rest of my life making you happy, and taking care of our baby." He pulled a small velvet box out of his pocket and opened it up, revealing a gold ring with several small diamonds.  
"我爱着你，明日香。一直如此，并将永远如此！我知道世界上有比我更优秀的人，但我可以保证，没有人会比我更爱你。我希望能用我的余生让你幸福，照顾好我们的孩子。" 他从口袋里掏出一个小天鹅绒盒子并打开，露出一枚镶有几颗小钻石的金戒指。

_"Ohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygod…"_ she thought as she saw the ring in his hand, as her heart started pounding in her chest, her breathing becoming labored, _"This is got to be a dream! This shit doesn't happen in real life! He's going to ask, oh my god, he's going ask…"_  
我的天啊我的天啊我的天啊……" 她看到他手里的戒指时心想，心跳加速，呼吸变得急促，"这一定是在做梦！现实生活中哪有这种事！他要问了，天啊，他要问了……

"Asuka Langley Soryu, would you do me the honor of becoming my wife? Will you marry me?" he asked, looking her straight in the eye. She could see the love in his eyes, hear the conviction in his voice, and feel the slight tremor in his body. Her eyes widened and her jaw dropped, never thinking this man would love her enough to ask _that_ question, pledging his entire life and purpose to her. She stayed silent for several seconds, shocked, as her mind tried to process the question.  
"惣流·明日香·兰格雷，你愿意接受我的荣幸，成为我的妻子吗？你愿意嫁给我吗？" 他直视着她的眼睛问道。她能从他的眼中看到爱意，听到他声音中的坚定，感受到他身体的微微颤抖。她的眼睛睁大，下巴掉了下来，从未想过这个男人会爱她到提出这个问题，将他的整个生命和目标都献给她。她沉默了几秒钟，震惊之余，她的思绪试图处理这个问题。

Doubt flooded Shinji's eyes after she didn't answer, "If you don't want to, I understand," he said, trying to keep the lump in his throat from choking him, " but I will still be here.." He was cut silent by fingers gently pressed against his lips.  
她没有回答，怀疑在真嗣的眼中泛滥，“如果你不愿意，我理解，”他努力抑制喉咙里的哽咽，“但我依然会在这里……”他的话被轻轻按在他唇上的手指打断了。

"Yes," she said gently, a radiant smile on her face, "I'll marry you." She reached around and hugged his neck. "You'll never know how long I've wanted to hear that from you!" she whispered in his ear.  
“是的，”她温柔地说，脸上洋溢着灿烂的笑容，“我愿意嫁给你。”她伸手环抱住他的脖子，“你永远不会知道我等这句话等了多久！”她在他的耳边低语。

"You'll never know how long I've wanted to ask that!" he replied as he hugged her gently. Gently, she broke the embrace, as he sat back on his heels and placed the ring on her finger. It was a perfect fit.  
“你永远不会知道我有多想问出那句话！”他回答道，轻轻地拥抱着她。她温柔地挣脱了拥抱，他则跪坐回去，将戒指戴在她的手指上。尺寸恰到好处。

"How did you know?" she wondered about the fit, as she admired how the ring shone in the moonlight. Tears of joy streamed down her face.  
“你怎么知道尺寸的？”她对戒指的合适感到好奇，同时欣赏着它在月光下闪耀的样子。喜悦的泪水顺着她的脸颊流淌。

"I just knew, must have been our sync training still hitting us when we least expect it," he replied as he looked at the woman in front of him, the woman who agreed to be his wife. He got off his knees and sat beside her once more, taking and holding her hand. His heart was still beating like mad, and a small, happy tear slid down the corner of one eye.  
“我就知道，一定是我们同步训练的效果还在我们不经意间影响着我们，”他回答道，目光投向面前的女子，那位同意成为他妻子的女子。他站起身，再次坐到她身边，握住并紧握她的手。他的心跳依旧狂烈，一滴小小的幸福泪水从眼角滑落。

"Shinji Ikari, are you crying?" she said through her own tears. She reached over and touched it.  
“碇真嗣，你在哭吗？”她含泪问道。她伸出手，轻轻触碰他的脸颊。

"Not very manly, huh? Guess you now know you're marrying a wimp," he said sadly, as she leaned over and kissed him gently on the lips.  
“不太像个男子汉，对吧？现在你知道你要嫁的是个懦夫了，”他悲伤地说，而她倾身向前，温柔地吻了他的唇。

"Hush, you're not a wimp. That's a happy tear if I ever saw one," she smiled, making him feel so much better. The two of them continued to sit on that bench for quite a while, enjoying the night and each other's company. They thought about the future, and the enormity of what they had just done. They had no regrets. Finally, Asuka stood and took her fiancé by the hand.  
“别这么说，你不是懦夫。那是我见过的最幸福的泪水，”她微笑着，让他感觉好多了。两人继续在那张长椅上坐了很久，享受着夜晚和彼此的陪伴。他们思考着未来，以及他们刚刚所做决定的重大意义。他们没有丝毫后悔。最后，明日香站起身，牵起她的未婚夫的手。

"Come on, baby, let's go home." she said with a smile at thinking about going home with the man she loved.  
"来吧，宝贝，我们回家。" 她微笑着说道，想到能与心爱的男人一起回家，心中满是喜悦。

"Yeah, we should get home and let Misato off the hook!" he said with a mischievous grin as they walked hand in hand back to the car.  
"是啊，我们该回家了，让美里也松口气！" 他带着一丝调皮的笑容说道，两人手牵手走向汽车。

"Misato knows?" Asuka asked, taken aback. "She knew you were going to ask me to marry you?"  
美里知道？" 明日香惊讶地问，"她知道你要向我求婚？

"Well, I had told Kaji, who of course told Misato. I showed her the ring today when she asked me why I sold my bike…"  
嗯，我告诉了加持，他当然告诉了美里。今天她问我为什么卖了摩托车，我就给她看了戒指……

"Whoa!" Asuka said as she stopped dead in her tracks, "You sold your bike?! Why?"  
哇！" 明日香停下脚步，惊讶地说，"你把自行车卖了？！为什么？

"To buy your ring," he said simply. Asuka was stunned.  
"为了买你的戒指，" 他简单地回答。明日香愣住了。

"But, but you loved that bike!"  
但是，你那么喜欢那辆自行车！

"I love you more, Asuka," he replied, as her turned to face her, " that was just a toy." Tears started anew as she wrapped him in a big hug.  
"我更爱你，明日香，" 他转过身面对她，"那只是个玩具。" 泪水再次涌出，她紧紧地拥抱了他。

"You idiot," she said fondly, "I never got a chance to ride on it!" she teased as they started walking again.  
“你这个傻瓜，”她温柔地说，“我从来没机会坐上去！”她打趣道，他们又开始继续走。

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"THIS IS DRIVING ME CRAZY!!" Misato screamed as she continued to pace her small apartment. Kaji just made sure to stay out of her way as she prowled around, looking like she was wanting to hit something. He refused to give her an easy target.  
“这简直让我发疯！！”美里尖叫着在她的小公寓里来回踱步。加持只是确保自己不挡她的路，她四处徘徊，看起来很想打什么东西。他拒绝成为她的容易目标。

"Misato, try to relax, will you?" he said, trying to sooth her troubled brow. Kaji knew how much those two kids meant to her, and like Shinji said, tonight would change everything.  
“美里，试着放松一下，好吗？”他说，试图抚平她紧皱的眉头。加持知道那两个孩子对她意味着什么，就像真嗣说的，今晚将改变一切。

"How can I relax?! You know what he has planned! I'm so scared one or both of them are going to get hurt by this! Oh hell, why couldn't Shinji be like most men and run screaming from this situation?" Kaji looked hurt at what she said.  
“我怎么能放松？！你知道他有什么计划！我太害怕他们中的一个或两个会因此受伤！哦天哪，为什么真嗣不能像大多数男人一样，从这种情况中尖叫着逃跑呢？”加持听到她的话显得很受伤。

"I'm not the one who ran, Misato," he said sadly. That stopped her cold, as she walked over to sofa and plopped down, with Kaji right beside her. She took his hand and sat quietly for a second or so.  
“我不是那个逃跑的人，美里。”他悲伤地说道。这句话让她顿时僵住了，她走到沙发旁坐下，直美就坐在她身边。她握住他的手，静静地坐了一会儿。

"I know," she said softly, "I'm the one who ran from commitment, not you. I was scared. Like I am now."  
“我知道，”她轻声说道，“我是那个逃避承诺的人，不是你。我害怕。就像我现在这样。”

"I understand," Kaji soothed, "Those two mean an awful lot to you, don't they? To both of us."  
“我理解，”直美安慰道，“那两个人对你来说非常重要，对吧？对我们俩都是。”

"Yeah, they do," she added, lost in thought, "it's like I got a second chance to be a mother, after we lost…" Kaji gently touched her lips to silence her.  
“是的，他们对我很重要，”她陷入沉思，“这就像我得到了第二次做母亲的机会，在我们失去之后……”直美温柔地触碰她的嘴唇，示意她不要再说了。

"Not now, not tonight. Please?" he asked. Misato just nodded. Pen-Pen waddled through the living room, giving the two humans a strange look, before running off with the beer he had kept hidden from everyone. Misato's eyes followed the beer longingly.  
“现在不行，今晚也不行。拜托了？”他问道。美里只是点了点头。企鹅潘-潘摇摇摆摆地穿过客厅，用奇怪的眼神看了两人一眼，然后带着他藏起来的啤酒跑掉了。美里的目光一直追随着那瓶啤酒，满是渴望。

"Been hard?" “很难熬吗？”

"Very," she replied as she tried to keep her hands from shaking. She was going to fight this and win. Just then, the front door slid open, as Shinji and Asuka walked in, arm-in-arm and smiling more than she had ever seen them smile before. "It about time you two got home!"  
“非常难熬，”她回答道，努力不让自己的手颤抖。她要战胜这一切，赢得胜利。就在这时，前门滑开了，真嗣和明日香手挽手走了进来，笑得比她以前见过的任何时候都要灿烂。“你们俩终于回家了！”

"What? It's not even ten yet!" Asuka said mischievously,as Shinji shook his head and laughed as two of the women he loved gave each other mock glares, before they broke in giggles as well.  
“什么？还没到十点呢！”明日香调皮地说道，真嗣摇着头笑了起来，两个他深爱的女人互相投去假装的瞪视，随后也忍不住笑出声来。

"Well? Did you two have a good time on your date?" Kaji asked teasingly, hoping beyond hope he would get the right answer.  
"怎么样？你们俩约会玩得开心吗？" 薰开玩笑地问道，心中无比希望他能得到正确的答案。

"Oh, you could say that," Shinji replied nonchalantly as Asuka raised her left hand and wiggled her finger, letting the light flash of off the diamonds. An ecstatic smile lit up Asuka's face as she thought about what that meant.  
"哦，你可以这么说，" 真嗣随意地回答，而明日香则举起左手，晃动着手指，让钻石的光芒闪烁。一想到这意味着什么，明日香脸上洋溢着狂喜的笑容。

"OH MY GOD!! YOU REALLY SAID YES?!" Misato screamed as she leapt off of the sofa, knocking Kaji to the ground and trampling poor Pen-Pen as she rushed the two teenagers and wrapped them up in her patented Misato-sized hug. "Oh God! I'm so happy for you two!!" she gushed, tears streaming from her eyes.  
"我的天啊！！你真的答应了？！" 美里尖叫着从沙发上跳起来，把薰撞倒在地，还不小心踩到了可怜的 Pen-Pen，她冲向两个青少年，用她标志性的美里式大拥抱将他们紧紧抱住。"哦，天哪！我为你们俩感到太高兴了！！" 她激动地说着，泪水从眼中涌出。

"Congradulations, Shinji!" Kaji said as he slapped the young man on the shoulder, then whispered in his ear, "You have got a bigger set of balls than any man I know!" Shinji blushed. "When's the date?"  
恭喜你，真嗣！" 薰说着拍了拍年轻人的肩膀，然后在他耳边低语，"你比我所认识的任何男人都更有胆量！" 真嗣脸红了。"婚礼什么时候举行？

"We're not sure yet. We still need to get moved into the new place, then get her dress, send out invitations…" Shinji was saying, before getting cut off by Asuka.  
"我们还不确定。我们还需要搬进新家，然后给她买婚纱，发邀请函……" 真嗣正说着，被明日香打断了。

"As soon as possible, after we move!" Asuka said as she grabbed Shinji by the waist, "You're mine now, Ikari! I'm not going to give you any chance to run and escape!"  
尽快，搬家之后！" 明日香说着，一把搂住真嗣的腰，"你现在属于我了，一尻！我不会给你任何逃跑的机会！

"Lord, I'm in trouble now," he teased as she playfully slapped his shoulder, as all four of them went to the living room to talk about the future.  
"天啊，我现在有麻烦了，" 他打趣道，她则俏皮地拍了拍他的肩膀，四人一起走向客厅，讨论未来。

It was hours later when Kaji excused himself and went home, and Shinji and Asuka retired for the night. Misato sat in the living room, sipping her tea, as her heart swelled with pride concerning the events of this evening. Shinji and Asuka looked so happy together, and Asuka's eyes just lit up as she and Misato sat and discussed plans for the wedding. Misato caused Asuka to blush when she brought up the fact she needed to throw the young German a bridal shower. Knowing Misato, it would be as embarrassing as hell to Asuka. Shinji chuckled at Asuka's predicament, until Kaji mentioned that he would be planning Shinji's bachelor party. Shinji blushed ten shades of red at the thought of what Kaji would cook up.  
几个小时后，加持告辞回家，真嗣和明日香也回房休息了。美里坐在客厅里，品着茶，心中为今晚的事情感到无比自豪。真嗣和明日香看起来如此幸福，明日香的眼中闪烁着光芒，她和美里坐在一起讨论婚礼计划。美里提到要为这位年轻的德国姑娘举办一个新娘送礼会，这让明日香脸红了。美里知道，这对明日香来说会非常尴尬。真嗣对明日香的窘境轻声笑了起来，直到加持提到他将筹划真嗣的单身派对。想到加持会搞出什么花样，真嗣的脸红得像十层红晕。

Misato was getting up to go to bed herself, knowing tomorrow would be a busy day. They were going to see their new place, and then they had to start making preparations for the wedding. Misato passed Asuka's door when something made her stop.  
美里正准备起身去睡觉，心里明白明天将是忙碌的一天。他们要去看看新家，然后就得开始筹备婚礼了。美里经过明日香的房门时，突然停了下来。

There were moans of ecstasy coming from Asuka's room. Misato's face flushed. _"Surely, they're not…"_ she thought to herself, not wanting the images flashing in her mind to come. "_It's got to be something else! They're not even married yet! Shinji's not that way! He would wait! And...and Asuka's pregnant! Wouldn't that hurt the baby?_" she thought, as the moans became louder. Misato finally convinced herself that it wasn't her business, when she heard two words shouted out.  
明日香的房间里传来阵阵愉悦的呻吟声。美里的脸颊泛起红晕。“不可能，他们不会……”她心中暗想，不愿让脑海中的画面浮现。“肯定是什么别的事情！他们还没结婚呢！真嗣不是那种人！他会等的！而且……明日香还怀孕了！那样不会伤到宝宝吗？”她想着，呻吟声却越来越大。美里最终说服自己这不是她该管的事，这时她听到了两声喊叫。

"Oh, Shinji!" “哦，真嗣！”

"All right, you two!" Misato yelled through the door, "Cut that out! I know you two are engaged, but really! You just can't…"  
“好了，你们俩！”美里隔着门喊道，“别闹了！我知道你们订婚了，但真的！你们不能……”

"What's wrong, Misato?" Shinji said as he opened the door, perplexed.  
"怎么了，美里？" 真嗣说着打开门，一脸困惑。

"What do you mean?" she barked "Just what the hell are you two doing?"  
你什么意思？" 她厉声问道，"你们俩到底在干什么？

" What? All I'm doing is rubbing…" he started, before Misato scrunched up her face.  
"什么？我只是……在按摩……" 他话还没说完，美里就皱起了眉头。

"ACK! No! NO! NO! I don't wanna know!!!" Misato screamed as she tried to keep the images from flooding her mind.  
"啊！不！不要！我不要知道！！！" 美里尖叫着，试图阻止那些画面涌入脑海。

"…her feet?" Shinji said, puzzled at his roommate's reaction. Misato stopped making faces and strange sounds and looked at him with genuine confusion.  
"…她的脚？" 真嗣说道，对他的室友的反应感到困惑。美里停止了做鬼脸和发出奇怪的声音，带着真正的困惑看着他。

"Her feet?" she stammered.  
"她的脚？" 她结结巴巴地说。

"Yeah, she doesn't wear heels very often, and she had those on for so long her feet hurt. Just what did you think we were doing?" Shinji asked, before it dawned on him what she had been getting at. "Misato!" he scolded, as his blush covered his whole body.  
"是啊，她不常穿高跟鞋，而且她穿了那么久，脚都疼了。你以为我们在做什么？" 真嗣问道，随后他才明白她指的是什么。"美里！" 他责备道，脸红遍布全身。

"What's going on?" Asuka asked as she stood next to Shinji. Misato saw she still wore her hose,but now she wore a long, pink, oversized sleep shirt that ended about halfway down her thighs. It was the same shirt Shinji had bought her a month ago when this started.  
"发生什么事了？" 明日香站在真嗣旁边问道。美里看到她仍然穿着丝袜，但现在她穿了一件长长的、粉红色的、 oversized 的睡衣，长度大约到她大腿的一半。这是一个月前真嗣给她买的那件睡衣。

"You're still dressed up a bit," Misato grinned as she saw how cute they looked together.  
“你还是打扮了一下，”美里笑着看他们在一起的样子有多可爱。

"What? The hose? I just haven't taken them off yet. I told Shinji my feet hurt, and he started rubbing them for me. I was tired and sore, and didn't want to wait any longer. Why were you yelling through the door?"  
“什么？连裤袜吗？我还没脱掉呢。我跟真嗣说我脚疼，他就帮我揉了起来。我累得要命，酸痛难忍，不想再等了。你干嘛在门外大喊大叫？”

"She thought we were…" Shinji stammered, before Asuka caught on.  
“她以为我们在……”真嗣结巴着说，阿斯卡随即明白了。

"Misato! How can you think such a thing?!" Asuka exploded, causing the older woman to cringe. "Shinji is too much of a gentleman to try anything like that! I besides, we're engaged! If we wanted to…."  
“美里！你怎么能这么想？！”阿斯卡爆发了，让年长的女人缩了缩身子。“真嗣是个十足的绅士，不会做那种事的！再说了，我们订婚了！如果我们要……”

"Okay! Okay! I'm sorry!" Misato apologized, "I should have trusted you not to do anything! Sheesh!"  
好了！好了！对不起！" 美里道歉道，"我本该相信你不会做什么的！真是的！

"That's okay Misato," Asuka said, sounding very tired, "It was probably a natural assumption after tonight. But if you'll excuse me, I'm ready for bed," she added as she walked out of her door and grabbed Shinji by the shirt, pulling him to his room. The door closed, leaving a befuddled Misato to stand before an empty room. She knew they had been literally sleeping with each other since this started, but this was the first time she saw Asuka go into Shinji's room without trying to sleep in her room first. Shaking her head, Misato walked to her room to try to get some rest.  
"没关系，美里。" 明日香听起来非常疲惫地说，"今晚之后，这可能是自然的假设。但如果你不介意的话，我准备睡觉了。" 她一边说一边走出房门，抓住真嗣的衬衫，把他拉进自己的房间。门关上了，留下一头雾水的美里站在空荡荡的房间前。她知道他们从这件事开始就一直睡在一起，但这是她第一次看到明日香直接走进真嗣的房间，而不是先尝试睡在自己的房间里。美里摇了摇头，走向自己的房间，试图休息一下。

"God, I could use a beer!"  
天啊，我真想来瓶啤酒！

### Chapter2
**A/N:** _I would like to thank everyone who read and enjoyed part one of 'Father', and I apologize that it took so long to finish up part two, but you know how life can be! You may notice that some of the characters seem to be OOC, but people do change over time. In this story, Shinji and Asuka are now 16, and to put it bluntly, have been through hell and back. This can effect and change anybody. This story is certainly not Gary-Stu, nor is it (in the words of one reviewer) a self insert or near self insert. There is and will be plenty of hardships for our lovebirds,of that you can be assured. For now, please set back and enjoy! Let me know what you think! Later! Lord Talon_  
作者的话：我想感谢所有阅读并喜欢《父亲》第一部分的读者，很抱歉第二部分花了这么长时间才完成，但你们知道生活总是这样！你可能会注意到一些角色似乎有些 OOC，但人总是会随着时间改变的。在这个故事中，真嗣和明日香现在 16 岁，坦白说，他们经历了地狱般的磨难。这会影响并改变任何人。这个故事绝不是加里·斯图式的，也不是（用一位评论者的话说）自我插入或接近自我插入。我们的这对恋人将会面临许多困难，这一点你可以确信。现在，请放松并享受吧！让我知道你的想法！再见！塔尔隆领主

The next day was Saturday, so they all had the day off. NERV personnel came to collect them to show them to their new apartment, which just happened to be in the same building, just a few floors higher up. Misato was the first one to spot the other person involved in this move as they stepped off the elevator.  
第二天是星期六，所以他们都有一天的休息时间。NERV 的工作人员来接他们，带他们去看新公寓，巧的是就在同一栋楼，只是高了几层。美里是第一个注意到这次搬家涉及的另一个人，当他们走出电梯时。

"Rei! You're here already?" the Major called out as they walked over to greet the First Child. Misato was shocked to see Asuka and Rei exchanging a hug, before Rei noticed the ring on Asuka's finger. Rei's jaw hit the ground as she and Asuka held on to each other and jumped around like only school girls could. The NERV personnel looked at them quizzically, until an order by Misato got them moving again.  
"丽！你已经到了吗？" 当他们走过去迎接初号机驾驶员时，美里大声喊道。看到明日香和丽互相拥抱，美里感到震惊，随后丽注意到了明日香手指上的戒指。丽惊讶得下巴都快掉下来了，她和明日香紧紧相拥，像只有学校女生才会那样跳来跳去。NERV 的工作人员疑惑地看着她们，直到美里的一声命令才让他们重新动起来。

"Are we ready to go inside?" asked Shinji as he walked over and took the red headed German by the hand, and lead her inside. Misato and Rei followed right behind them. The apartment was huge compared to their current one. The living room was spacious, and the kitchen was easily three times the size of their old one.  
"我们可以进去了吗？" 真嗣边问边走过来牵起红发德国女孩的手，领她进屋。美里和丽紧随其后。这套公寓比他们现在的要大得多。客厅宽敞，厨房的面积是旧厨房的三倍。

"At least Shinji has a decent place to cook dinner now," Asuka said as she slapped him on the shoulder. Misato and Rei giggled in the background as Shinji just rolled his eyes.  
"至少现在真嗣有个像样的地方做饭了，" 明日香拍了拍他的肩膀说道。美里和丽在背景中咯咯笑着，而真嗣只是翻了个白眼。

"Why me?" he asked in mock misery, earning another slap. He pointed out the corner of the kitchen where Pen-Pen's refrigerator would go and still be out of everyone's way. The kitchen had more than enough room for the table and chairs to go and still have plenty of room to move.  
"为什么是我？" 他故作痛苦地问道，随即又挨了一巴掌。他指出了厨房角落，那里放上 Pen-Pen 的冰箱也不会碍事。厨房空间充裕，足够摆放餐桌椅，还能留出宽敞的走动空间。

"Misato, I guess that is your room, right over there, " Shinji pointed out, as Misato walked over to check it out. It was larger than her current one, and it had a small bathroom over to the side.  
"美里，我想那边应该是你的房间，" 真嗣指着说道，美里走过去查看。房间比她现在的要大，旁边还有一个小浴室。

"Two bathrooms?" Misato asked, never having more than one in any place she ever lived before.  
"两个卫生间？" 美里惊讶地问，她以前住的地方从未有过一个以上的卫生间。

"Yep! Between you, Asuka, and the baby, we are going to need two!" he grinned as he responded. Rei smiled as Asuka and Misato both stuck their tongues out at him.  
“没错！有你、明日香和宝宝在，我们得要两间房！”他笑着回应。丽微笑着，而明日香和美里都对他吐了吐舌头。

"Here's Asuka and the baby's room, right next to the main bathroom. I'll take the small one right next to theirs" Shinji said as three sets of eyes looked at him quizzically.  
“这里是明日香和宝宝的房间，紧挨着主浴室。我住旁边的小房间。”真嗣说道，三双眼睛疑惑地看着他。

"Whaaaaat?" Asuka asked, both sadness and shock in her voice. _"My husband-to-be doesn't want to stay with me?"_ Hurt was clearly in her eyes. "Shinji?" she asked, tears forming "You don't want to be with me?"  
“什么？”明日香问道，声音中带着悲伤和震惊。“我未来的丈夫不想和我住一起？”她的眼中明显流露出受伤的神情。“真嗣？”她哽咽着问，泪水开始涌出，“你不想和我在一起吗？”

"God, yes! I want to be with you so badly, it's just…" he stopped as he glanced at the other two standing there. Asuka took the hint.  
"天啊，是的！我太想和你在一起了，只是……" 他停下来看了看站在那里的另外两人。明日香领会了暗示。

"Excuse us a minute, you two," Asuka growled as she grabbed Shinji by the shirt and yanked him into the bedroom and slammed the door shut.  
"你们俩稍等一下，" 明日香咆哮着，抓住真嗣的衬衫把他拽进卧室，砰地一声关上了门。

"Shinji's in trouble, isn't he?" Rei asked as Misato just rolled her eyes at her charges' behavior.  
"真嗣遇到麻烦了，对吧？" 绫波问，而美里只是对她俩的行为翻了个白眼。

"Yeah, Rei, he's in trouble, but I think I know why he did it…" Misato replied as she leaned over and put an ear to the door. Rei was shocked for a second, before doing the same.  
“是啊，丽，他遇到麻烦了，但我想我知道他为什么这么做……”美里回答着，俯身将耳朵贴在门上。丽震惊了一瞬，随即也照做了。

"Alright, Ikari! Explain yourself!" Asuka snapped, fire blazing in her eyes.  
“好吧，碇！解释一下你自己！”明日香厉声喝道，眼中怒火熊熊。

"I'm sorry, it…it's just I didn't want to assume anything, Asuka," he said a little sadly. "I promised to be here for you and the baby, and I promised my all to you, but I didn't want to impose on you."  
“对不起，我只是……不想妄下结论，明日香，”他有些悲伤地说，“我承诺过会陪在你和宝宝身边，全心全意对你，但我不想强加于你。”

"Shinji, we're getting married! We're supposed to be together. Don't you want to be with me?" she asked, afraid she'll hear the answer that would kill her.  
"真嗣，我们要结婚了！我们应该在一起。你不想和我在一起吗？" 她问道，害怕听到那个会让她心碎的答案。

"I want to be with you more than anything, Asuka," he answered her, looking deeply into her eyes, making her knees weak.  
"我比任何事情都更想和你在一起，明日香，" 他回答她，深情地凝视着她的眼睛，让她双腿发软。

"If you don't want to be with me, why ask me to marry you?" she continued as she sniffed. He walked over and held her gently. " Did you ask because you love me, or because you thought the baby needed a father?"  
"如果你不想和我在一起，为什么要向我求婚？" 她继续问道，抽泣着。他走过去，温柔地拥抱着她。" 你求婚是因为爱我，还是因为你认为孩子需要一个父亲？"

Shinji stood there for a second, wanting to reassure her, but not knowing what to say. Anything other than total honesty would drive a wedge between them, and he didn't want that. "Both," he answered truthfully. "Did you say 'yes' because you love me or because the baby needs a father?"  
真嗣站在那里，想要安慰她，却不知该说什么。任何不坦诚的话都会在他们之间制造隔阂，他不想那样。“两者都有，”他如实回答。“你答应是因为爱我还是因为孩子需要一个父亲？”

"Both," she answered truthfully as well. She understood why he doubted, because she had doubted in the back of her mind as well. But to his credit, his actions just a few minutes prior proved to her he was thinking of her again.  
“两者都有，”她也如实回答。她明白他为何怀疑，因为她内心深处也曾有过疑虑。但值得称赞的是，他几分钟前的举动向她证明了他又在为她着想了。

"It's just …I was just …" Shinji said, scared he had screwed things up again. She reached over and took his hand.  
“只是……我只是……”真嗣说道，害怕自己又搞砸了。她伸出手，握住了他的手。

"I know, baby, and that's why I love you," Asuka replied as she gathered him up in a big hug. "We already sleep with each other at night, as it is. I want my husband to stay with me. If we're going to share a life together, I think we can share a room together."  
"我知道，宝贝，这就是我爱你的原因，"明日香回答道，同时紧紧地抱住了他。"我们晚上已经一起睡了，不是吗？我希望我的丈夫能留在我身边。既然我们要共度一生，我想我们可以共用一个房间。"

"As you wish, Asuka," he said with a smile as he gave her a kiss on the forehead, making her feel all warm and fuzzy inside. "I guess the smaller room will be for our little girl when she gets older."  
"如你所愿，明日香，"他微笑着说，并在她的额头上轻轻一吻，让她心里暖洋洋的。"我想那个小房间将来会是我们女儿的。"

"I still want to know why you think it's going to be a girl," she playfully growled, "the baby could just as easily be a boy who will be as kind and caring as his father."  
"我还是想知道你为什么认为会是个女孩，"她俏皮地咆哮道，"宝宝也可能是个男孩，他会像他父亲一样善良和体贴。"

"I don't know, still just a feeling," Shinji replied, as he reached over to open the door, "Let's go let the others know…YEEOUCH!!" he yelped as Misato and Rei fell into the room, knocking him to the floor.  
"我不知道，只是一种感觉，" 真嗣回答道，同时伸手去开门，"我们去告诉其他人吧……哎哟！！" 他惊叫一声，因为美里和绫波跌进了房间，把他撞倒在地。

"Uh, how's it going?" Misato smiled and waved to them. Rei quickly got up from the floor and smoothed out her dress.  
"呃，大家好吗？" 美里微笑着向他们挥手。绫波迅速从地板上站起来，整理了一下她的裙子。

"What's going on here?" Asuka demanded, her hands on her hips. "Eavesdropping, are we?"  
"这里发生了什么？" 明日香双手叉腰质问道，"偷听，是吗？"

"Uh, whatever gave you that idea?" Misato feigned innocence as she picked herself up and gave Shinji a hand.  
“呃，是什么让你这么想的？”美里装作无辜地站起身，向真嗣伸出手。

"I bet if we checked, we'd find incriminating ear prints on the door," Asuka smirked, as she then explained about the room arraignments.  
“我打赌，如果我们检查一下，会发现门上有可疑的耳印，”明日香得意地笑着，然后解释了房间的安排。

After inspecting Rei's apartment and astonished that her move was already complete, the three ladies decided it was time to do some serious shopping for the wedding. Shinji and Pen-Pen were left behind in the old apartment to supervise the packing and moving.  
在检查了绫波的公寓并惊讶于她的搬家已经完成后，三位女士决定是时候为婚礼进行一些认真的购物了。真嗣和企鹅潘-潘则留在旧公寓里监督打包和搬家。

"Make sure they don't go through my underwear!" Asuka said as she hugged Shinji before leaving.  
"确保他们不会翻我的内衣！" 明日香在离开前紧紧抱住真嗣说道。

"I promise! That's my job!" he replied and rubbed his hands in anticipation just as Kaji did before. She gasped and playfully slapped his arm.  
"我保证！这是我的职责！" 他回答道，并像以前加持那样搓着手，满怀期待。她惊呼一声，开玩笑地拍了拍他的手臂。

"You sure you don't want to come?" Asuka whispered softly.  
"你确定不想一起来吗？" 明日香轻声细语地问道。

"I'm sure, hon. You three need to spend some time together. I'm sure a guy would just drag you three down."  
"我确定，亲爱的。你们三个需要一起度过一些时光。我敢肯定，有个男生只会拖你们后腿。"

"Yeah? Well, who's going to carry all the packages?" Misato teased.  
"是吗？那谁来提所有的包裹呢？" 美里打趣道。

"What? And deny you the chance to build your muscles up?" Shinji shot back. Misato gave him a dirty look, then smiled.  
"什么？难道要剥夺你锻炼肌肉的机会吗？" 真嗣回敬道。美里瞪了他一眼，然后笑了。

"Oh well! Just for that, you have to come to work Monday after school. We gotta build you up, too!" Misato replied sweetly as she and the others headed for the door.  
"哦，好吧！就为了这个，你周一放学后得来上班。我们也得把你培养起来！" 美里甜甜地回答，和其他人一起向门口走去。

"You suck, Misato," he grumbled good-naturedly.  
"你真坏，美里，" 他好脾气地咕哝道。

"Do not," she said as she waved goodbye.  
"才不呢，" 她挥手告别时说道。

"That's not what Kaji says!" he said loudly before the door closed. Misato spun on her heels and tried to say something back when Rei and Asuka grabbed her by the arms.  
"那不是加持说的！" 他在门关闭前大声说道。美里转身试图回击，却被绫波和明日香抓住了双臂。

"Come on, Misato! You two can have a teasing contest later!" Asuka smirked as they dragged her out the door. Shinji laughed evilly.  
"快点，美里！你们俩待会儿再比谁更能调侃吧！" 明日香一边拖着她出门，一边得意地笑着。真嗣则邪恶地笑了起来。

"But…but did you hear what he said? Let me go, I gotta…"  
"但是……但是你听到他说什么了吗？放开我，我得……"

"Yes, we heard," Asuka replied as she winked at her fiancé. "Now come on! We can spend his money!" Now Misato laughed evilly as they left Shinji on his own.  
"是的，我们听到了，" 明日香回答道，同时向她的未婚夫眨了眨眼。"快来吧！我们可以花他的钱！" 现在美里邪恶地笑了，他们留下真嗣一个人离开了。

The drive to the Mall went well, especially seeing how Misato was the driver. They ended up forcing only three cars off the road this time, which was good for Misato. Asuka, however, kept biting her tongue to keep from releasing a stream of mixed up Japanese and German curse words that was sure to cause instant death to all who heard them.  
开车去商场的路上一切顺利，尤其是考虑到美里是司机。这次他们只逼停了三辆车，这对美里来说算是不错的表现。然而，明日香一直在咬紧牙关，以免释放出一连串混杂的日语和德语咒骂，这些话绝对会让所有听到的人立刻丧命。

_"Damn! I should have convinced Shinji to come!"_ Asuka thought miserably as she and Rei staggered out of the car. Rei was pale, even for an albino. _"He could have at least drove us here without scaring us to death!"_  
"该死！我应该说服真嗣一起来的！" 明日香痛苦地想着，她和绫波蹒跚地走出车外。绫波脸色苍白，即使对于一个白化病患者来说也是如此。"他至少可以不吓死我们地把我们送到这里！"

"Okay girls! Let's go shopping!" Misato cheered as she grabbed both teenagers by the arm and dragged them toward Asuka's favorite destination. The two girls were a bit sluggish, as they had yet to recover from the ride. Asuka recovered first and insisted that they visit the bridal shops first.  
“好了，姑娘们！我们去购物吧！” 美里兴奋地抓住两个青少年的手臂，拉着她们朝明日香最喜欢的目的地走去。两个女孩有些迟缓，她们还没从刚才的骑行中恢复过来。明日香最先恢复过来，坚持要先去婚纱店。

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Well, what do you think?" Asuka asked as she came out of the changing room. This as the seventh dress she had tried, and she thought this one was perfect. The other six had one little thing or another that wasn't quite right in her eyes. The others had gushed all about previous ones, but she was sure this was the one.  
“那么，你们觉得怎么样？” 明日香从试衣间出来问道。这是她试穿的第七件礼服，她觉得这件完美无瑕。之前的六件总有那么一点不尽如人意的地方。其他人之前都对之前的几件赞不绝口，但她确信这件才是最合适的。

"Oh, wow!" Misato gasped as she stared at the young redhead before her. Tears formed in her eyes at the vision. The top of the redhead's dress was high cut, but sheer down to just above the bust, giving an ample view of her cleavage. The sheerness continued on to the sleeves, until they came just above the wrists, which were lace and extended down to a point on the back of her hands, ending in a single finger loop. The remainder of the bodice was covered in lace. The sheer part of the dress had embroidered starbursts evenly spaced, giving it a shimmering quality. The skirt was full and covered in lace to match the rest of bodice, and had a huge train. The veil Asuka had picked to go with the dress was a perfect match, sheer with starbursts. The effect was, in a word, magical. "God, that is so perfect!"  
"哦，哇！" 美里倒抽一口气，盯着眼前的年轻红发女孩。泪水在她眼中打转。红发女孩的礼服上衣高领剪裁，但从领口到胸线以上都是透明的，充分展示了她的乳沟。透明材质一直延伸到袖子，袖口处则是蕾丝，并延伸至手背，末端有一个单指环。其余的紧身上衣部分都覆盖着蕾丝。礼服的透明部分均匀绣有星爆图案，闪闪发光。裙摆宽大，同样覆盖着与上衣相匹配的蕾丝，并拖着长长的裙摆。明日香挑选的头纱与礼服完美搭配，同样透明并饰有星爆图案。整体效果，用一个词来形容，就是魔幻。"天哪，真是太完美了！"

"Asuka, you are so beautiful!" Rei exclaimed, which still threw Asuka for a loop. Over the past year, Rei had opened up so much it was hard to believe. With Asuka's pregnancy and engagement to her brother, Rei had actually for the most part turned into what could pass as a normal girl.  
"明日香，你真是太美了！" 丽赞叹道，这让明日香有些措手不及。过去一年里，丽的变化之大令人难以置信。随着明日香的怀孕和与她哥哥的订婚，丽实际上已经变得像个普通女孩了。

"Yep! I think that's the one!" Misato exclaimed as the Second Child admired herself in the mirror. Her face lit up at what she saw, then frowned for just a second. Something wasn't quite right.  
“没错！我觉得就是它！” 明日香在镜子前欣赏着自己的模样，兴奋地喊道。她的脸上洋溢着喜悦，随即又微微皱了皱眉。似乎有什么地方不太对劲。

"Oh! Yeah! I remember now!" she exclaimed as she reached into her handbag and pulled out a small white object. "Misato? Could you put this on me, please?" She handed Misato a small cameo on a white lace ribbon.  
“哦！对了！我现在想起来了！” 她一边说，一边从手提包里掏出一个白色的小物件。“美里，你能帮我戴上这个吗？” 她递给美里一个镶有白色蕾丝缎带的小浮雕。

"Where did you get this, Asuka?" Misato asked as she studied the cameo. It was old and looked delicate, and it was exquisite. Misato's hands trembled a bit as she placed the ribbon around Asuka's throat.  
“明日香，你从哪儿得到这个的？” 美里仔细端详着那个浮雕，它古老而精致，显得十分脆弱。美里小心翼翼地将缎带绕过明日香的脖子，双手不禁微微颤抖。

"Aunt Heidi gave it to me when she visited a few months back," Asuka answered as she turned and looked once more at her reflection. Now she was happy. "It was originally Grandma's, then Aunt Heidi's. Since she didn't have any daughters, she gave it to me! _Now_ it's perfect!"  
"几个月前海蒂阿姨来访时送给我的，" 明日香回答着，转身再次看向镜子中的自己。现在她感到无比幸福。"这原本是奶奶的，后来传给了海蒂阿姨。因为她没有女儿，所以就把它给了我！现在一切都完美了！"

"Misato, are you okay?" Rei asked as she noticed the Major was pale and starting to tremble a little. Asuka had a worried look on her face as well.  
"美里，你还好吗？" 绫波注意到美里脸色苍白，身体微微颤抖，便问道。明日香脸上也露出了担忧的神情。

"Huh? I'm fine! Just emotional, that's all!" Misato replied with a wave of her hand "Now, how's about the bridesmaids? What are they going to wear?"  
"嗯？我没事！只是有点情绪化，就这样！" 美里挥了挥手回答道，"那么，伴娘们呢？她们要穿什么？"

"Uh, who _are_ the bridesmaids?" Rei asked. She had studied up on wedding customs in the past, not too long after she broke the Commander's hold on her, so she knew _what_ bridesmaids were. She just didn't have any idea on who Asuka would choose. The next answer shocked her more than when Kensuke peeked up her skirt one day at school.  
"呃，伴娘是谁？" 丽问道。她曾在过去研究过婚礼习俗，就在她摆脱指挥官的控制后不久，所以她知道伴娘是什么。她只是不知道明日香会选择谁。接下来的回答让她比某天在学校被健介偷看裙底时还要震惊。

"Well, you two, of course! Duh!" Asuka said, enjoying the shock on her friends' faces, "Hikari, too, when I tell her!" Immediately afterwards, Asuka was treated to squeals of delight from the other two as they encompassed her in yet another hug. _"I could get used to this,"_ she thought as they broke the hug up to discuss the other dresses needed. She was starting to regret all the years she spent distancing herself from others to keep from getting hurt. _"This was definitely more fun!"_ .  
"当然是你俩啦！废话！" 明日香说道，享受着朋友们脸上的震惊表情，"还有光，等我告诉她！" 紧接着，明日香被另外两人的欢呼声包围，她们再次拥抱了她。"我可能会习惯这个，"她想着，当她们分开讨论其他需要的礼服时。她开始后悔那些年为了不受伤而疏远他人的日子。"这绝对更有趣！

"Damn! Did you have to buy the whole mall?" Shinji complained as he stumbled over packages and boxes scattered across their new bedroom. The move had been completed by late afternoon, and it wasn't until several hours later that the three ladies returned from the day's outing. Shinji was immediately drafted to lug everything from the car, seeing how Asuka and Rei weren't feeling good for some reason.  
"该死！你非得把整个商场都买下来吗？" 真嗣抱怨着，踉踉跄跄地跨过散落在他们新卧室里的包裹和箱子。搬家在傍晚时分完成，而直到几个小时后，三位女士才从当天的外出归来。真嗣立刻被征召去从车里搬东西，毕竟明日香和丽不知为何感觉不太舒服。

"This isn't everything," Asuka called out from the bathroom, " the dresses are going to be delivered in the next couple of days. I needed a new wardrobe for some strange reason," she added as she came into the room, patting her belly and smiling. Shinji couldn't help but smile, as well.  
"这还不是全部，" 明日香从浴室里喊道，"过几天会送来那些裙子。不知为何，我需要一个新衣橱，" 她补充道，一边走进房间，一边轻拍着肚子微笑。真嗣也忍不住笑了。

"Come here, beautiful," he said as pulled her close and kissed her, sending shivers down her spine. Asuka giggled.  
"过来，美人儿，" 他说着，将她拉近并吻了她，让她脊背一阵颤栗。明日香咯咯笑了起来。

"You say that now, but I'm gonna get fat and ugly soon!" she teased as she fell deeper into his embrace. "That's why I gotta snag you as soon as I can!"  
"你现在这么说，但我很快就会变胖变丑的！" 她打趣道，更深地依偎在他怀里。"所以我得尽快把你抓住！"

"Never happen," Shinji said as fell to his knees and kissed her belly. Asuka gasped at this, but was even more surprised a second later, "What do you think, little one? We know Momma will never be fat and ugly, don't we?" He placed the side of his face to Asuka's belly and hugged his family. Asuka felt a warmth she had never experienced before. She wrapped her arms around his neck.  
"绝不可能，" 真嗣说着跪了下来，亲吻她的腹部。明日香对此感到惊讶，但更让她意外的是下一刻，"你觉得呢，小家伙？我们知道妈妈永远不会变胖变丑，对吧？" 他把脸颊贴在明日香的肚子上，拥抱着家人。明日香感受到了一种前所未有的温暖。她用双臂环抱住他的脖子。

"Why do you do that?" Asuka asked as she ran her fingers through his hair.  
"你为什么要这么做？" 明日香问道，手指轻轻穿过他的头发。

"I can't let her think she's ignored! Daddy's gotta talk to her, doesn't he, little one?"  
"我不能让她觉得被忽视了！爸爸得跟她聊聊，对吧，小宝贝？"

"Not that, dummy," Asuka sighed, still enjoying the warmth of his embrace. "Why do you defend me, even from myself?"  
"不是那个，傻瓜，" 明日香叹了口气，依然享受着他怀抱的温暖。"你为什么总是保护我，甚至是从我自己手中？"

"That should be obvious," he said as he stood and looked her in the eye, " because I love you."  
"那应该是显而易见的，" 他说着站起身，直视她的眼睛，"因为我爱你。"

"Is that going to be your standard answer now, instead of 'I'm sorry'?," she smirked as she saw the twinkle in his eye.  
"那以后这就是你的标准回答了，不再说'对不起'了？"她看到他眼中的闪光，嘴角勾起一抹笑意。

"Yep!" Shinji replied as Asuka reached over and smacked him in the side of the head with a handy pillow. He fell over laughing into the bed.  
"没错！" 真嗣回答道，这时明日香伸手用一个顺手的枕头拍了拍他的头侧。他笑倒在了床上。

"Good!" she said as she crawled on top on him, "Now, pucker up, mister!"  
"好极了！" 她说着爬到他身上，"现在，撅起嘴来，先生！"

Many, many minutes and several dozen kisses later, Asuka gazed across the room as she snuggled into Shinji's arms. She still couldn't believe things had taken the turn they had. She was engaged to the man who she tried for the longest to deny she had feelings for. They now openly shared a room and a bed, and talked about the future of their child.  
许多、许多分钟和几十个吻之后，明日香依偎在真嗣的怀里，环视着房间。她仍然无法相信事情会发展到这一步。她竟然与那个她曾长时间试图否认自己对其有感情的男人订婚了。如今，他们公开地共处一室、同床共枕，并谈论着他们孩子的未来。

Most of the boxes in their room were hers from her old room, but a few of his possessions could be seen here and there. Shinji's beloved SDAT player was on her dresser, sitting next to the A-10 clips she constantly wore to hold her hair back. His school uniforms hung on one side of the closet, next to his killer black suit. Her various dresses and school uniforms took up most of the rest of the space in the closet. Her violin case was on the top shelf in the closet, along with other bits and pieces she had collected over the years. Just about everywhere she looked, she could see the room was a blend of Shinji and herself, just as their lives were now beginning to blend and merge.  
房间里大部分的箱子都是她从旧房间搬来的，但他的几样物品也随处可见。真嗣珍爱的 SDAT 播放器放在她的梳妆台上，旁边是她一直用来束发的 A-10 发夹。他的校服挂在衣橱的一侧，旁边是他那套黑色的正装。她的各式连衣裙和校服占据了衣橱的大部分空间。她的提琴盒放在衣橱顶层，旁边还有她多年来收集的其他小物件。无论她望向何处，都能看到这个房间融合了真嗣和她自己的痕迹，正如他们的生活正开始融合与交汇。

Still, something bugged her. _"Something's missing,"_ she thought to herself as she carefully got out of the bed, so as not to wake Shinji. Her head was beginning to spin a little as she made her way to the bathroom to splash a little water in her face. It always seemed to help the nausea pass. That was another reason Shinji was so handy to have around, he was a fount of useful information. _"Maybe he should go into medicine,"_ she mused as she walked back to the room when it hit finally hit her. She knew what was missing.  
然而，有些事情让她感到不安。“少了点什么，”她暗自思忖，小心翼翼地从床上起身，以免吵醒真嗣。她走向浴室，打算往脸上泼些水，这总能缓解她的恶心感。这也是真嗣在身边如此方便的另一个原因，他总是知道很多有用的信息。“也许他应该去学医，”她一边走回房间一边想着，直到突然间她明白了。她知道少了什么。

Asuka quietly looked around the room, but still didn't find what she was looking for. She snuck back out and entered the spare bedroom and searched, but she still could not find it. She then turned her attention to the rest of the apartment, wondering if it had been left out. Crawling back into bed, she gently shook Shinji awake.  
明日香悄悄地环顾房间，但仍未找到她要找的东西。她蹑手蹑脚地走出房间，进入备用卧室继续搜寻，却依然一无所获。她随后将注意力转向公寓的其他地方，猜测是否遗漏了什么。回到床上，她轻轻摇醒了真嗣。

"What's wrong, Asuka? Are you feeling okay?" he asked groggily as she propped herself upon her elbow and looked him in the eye.  
“怎么了，明日香？你还好吗？”他睡眼惺忪地问道，她则撑起身子，用肘部支撑着，直视他的眼睛。

"Shinji, where's your cello?" she asked worriedly, "Did it get left behind in the old apartment?" She secretly loved to hear him play, and the thought of him losing his cello was heartbreaking. The look on his face when he played was heavenly, and she had always wanted to play a duet with him one day.  
"真嗣，你的大提琴呢？" 她担忧地问道，"是不是忘在旧公寓了？" 她暗自喜欢听他演奏，想到他可能丢失了大提琴，她感到心碎。他演奏时的神情如天神般，她一直梦想着有一天能与他合奏一曲。

"Huh? What?" he asked nervously, suddenly wide awake. Hoping she wouldn't notice, he tried to feign confusion. "What are you talking about?"  
"啊？什么？" 他紧张地问道，突然完全清醒过来。希望她不会注意到，他试图装出困惑的样子。"你在说什么？"

"Don't give me that, Shinji!" she growled, not fooled one bit by his act. "Where is your cello? I don't see it anywhere!"  
"别装傻了，真嗣！" 她咆哮道，对他的表演一点也不买账。"你的大提琴在哪里？我哪儿都没看到！"

"Uh…," Shinji stammered, trying to think of an answer that wouldn't set the fiery redhead off , "well…mm…you see…" Asuka glared daggers into him.  
"呃…," 真嗣结巴着，试图找到一个不会激怒这位火爆红发女孩的答案，"嗯…这个…你看…" 明日香用锐利的目光瞪着他。

"Ikari, if you don't answer me right now, I'm gonna shave your head bald in your sleep, put you in one of my dresses, tie you to the flagpole at school and leave you there for the rest of the weekend!" she seethed at his trying to keep something from her. "Now, where is your cello?!"  
"一尻，如果你现在不回答我，我就在你睡觉时把你的头剃光，给你穿上我的裙子，把你绑在学校旗杆上，让你在那里度过整个周末！" 她对他试图隐瞒什么感到愤怒。"现在，你的大提琴在哪里？！"

"What does it matter, Asuka?" he sighed, laying back down and staring up at the ceiling. "I know my playing bothered you, so you shouldn't worry about it right now!"  
"这有什么关系，明日香？" 他叹了口气，重新躺下，盯着天花板。"我知道我的演奏打扰了你，所以你现在不应该担心这个！"

"Shinji!" she yelled at him, shocked at what he said. He hadn't spoken to her like that in a long time. "Tell me!"  
"真嗣！" 她朝他大喊，震惊于他的话语。他已经很久没有这样对她说话了。"告诉我！"

"I sold it!" he shouted, bolting upright on the bed, "Okay? Happy now?" he sighed as he fell back down to his pillow. Asuka just sat there, stunned.  
"我卖了它！" 他吼道，猛地从床上坐起，"行了吧？现在满意了吗？" 他叹了口气，又倒回枕头上。明日香只是坐在那里，目瞪口呆。

"You sold it?" she asked sadly, a tear trying to force it's way out of the corner her eye. "You jerk! You fucking jerk!" she yelled as she pounded on his chest, her emotions once more out of her control.  
"你卖了它？" 她伤心地问，一滴泪试图从眼角挤出。"你这个混蛋！你这个该死的混蛋！" 她一边喊着，一边捶打他的胸膛，情绪再次失控。

"I'm sorry, Asuka," Shinji said sadly as he stroked her hair, her tears soaking his shirt, "I didn't mean to yell at you."  
"对不起，明日香，" 真嗣悲伤地说着，轻抚她的头发，她的泪水浸湿了他的衬衫，"我不是有意对你大喊大叫的。"

"That's not it, you idiot!" she yelled into his chest. "Why the hell did you sell your cello?" Shinji just laid there, bewildered.  
"不是那个问题，你这个白痴！" 她对着他的胸口喊道，"你他妈为什么要卖掉你的大提琴？" 真嗣只是躺在那里，一脸困惑。"

"Well, I sold it the same time I sold the bike," he replied slowly, "I wasn't too sure how things were going to go, so I had to make sure I had at least a little money set back for us. What I had left from the ring I placed in my account to cover everything else. The bike and the cello were the only two valuable things I owned. I didn't think you would mind."  
"嗯，我卖掉它的时候也卖掉了自行车，" 他缓缓回答，"我不太确定事情会怎么发展，所以我得确保我们至少有一点积蓄。戒指剩下的钱我存进了账户，用来支付其他开销。自行车和大提琴是我仅有的两件值钱的东西。我以为你不会介意的。"

"You jerk," she said softly at what he had done set in, "you sold it for me?"  
"你这个混蛋，"她轻声说道，意识到他的所作所为，"你为了我把它卖了？"

"Yes, I did," Shinji said as he tried to comfort her, "Like I said, I knew my playing it bothered you, so I didn't think you would mind."  
"是的，我卖了，"真嗣试图安慰她，"就像我说的，我知道我弹它会让你困扰，所以我想你不会介意的。"

"Who's going to play for me now?" Asuka sobbed, "Who's going to play for our baby?"  
"现在谁来为我弹琴？"明日香啜泣着，"谁来为我们的小孩弹琴？"

"What?" he asked, astonished at her revelation.  
"什么？" 他问道，对她的话感到震惊。

"I loved your playing," she replied sadly, "It used to take me away, away from the bad memories, the nightmares, the terrors. It was like you made a little world just for me to hide in, safe from everyone. I wanted to play with you, just to share in that little bit of magic. I wanted her to hear her Daddy playing…" She sobbed again.  
"我喜欢你的演奏，" 她悲伤地回答，"它曾带我远离那些糟糕的记忆、噩梦和恐惧。就像你为我创造了一个小小的世界，让我可以安全地躲藏，远离所有人。我想和你一起演奏，只是为了分享那一点点魔法。我想让她听到她爸爸的演奏……" 她再次啜泣起来。

"God, Asuka, I'm so sorry," Shinji said as her held her tight, "I didn't know…"  
"天啊，明日香，我很抱歉，" 真嗣紧紧抱着她说，"我不知道……"

"Do you miss it?" she asked between sobs.  
"你怀念它吗？" 她在啜泣间问道。

"It's just a object, Asuka, " Shinji replied, avoiding an answer.  
"那只是个物品，明日香，" 真嗣回答，避而不答。

"Answer me!" she seethed.  
"回答我！" 她怒气冲冲地说。

"Yes, I do," he sighed, "but you are more important."  
“是的，我愿意，”他叹息道，“但你更重要。”

"Jerk," she said without malice as she quietly slid to sleep.  
“混蛋，”她无恶意地说着，静静地滑入梦乡。

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It wasn't too long after she has awakened from her coma that Asuka had learned how powerful music truly was. She had been sitting on her bed one evening, just staring off into space as she tried to fight the horrible images that assaulted her mind once more. It had been this way ever since the Fifteenth had attacked her mind.  
在她从昏迷中醒来后不久，明日香就领悟到了音乐的真正力量。那晚，她坐在床上，只是凝视着虚空，试图再次驱散那些不断侵袭她心灵的可怕画面。自从第十五使徒攻击她的心灵以来，情况一直如此。

It had taken every bit of her willpower as well as prodding from a certain male roommate that had finally pulled herself from the abyss. The memories and images never left. Sometimes they would be buried under whatever it was that she was concentrating on at the time, but they always returned. Ever vicious, ever cruel, ever taunting.  
她几乎耗尽了所有的意志力，再加上某个男性室友的催促，才终于将自己从深渊中拉了出来。那些记忆和影像从未离去。有时它们会被她当时专注的事情掩盖，但它们总会回来。永远那么恶毒，永远那么残忍，永远那么嘲弄。

That was how it had been this night, as the sight of her mother swinging by her neck once more leapt to the foreground, dominating the nightmare landscape that was her mind. The horrible doll that had replace Asuka in her mother's mind stood there, laughing cruelly at her as it slapped at her mother's feet, causing the insane smile on her mother's lips to turn into horrible shrieking laughter.  
今晚就是这样，她母亲上吊的景象再次跃入脑海，占据了噩梦般的心灵画面。那个取代了明日香在她母亲心中的可怕玩偶站在那里，残忍地笑着拍打她母亲的脚，使得她母亲唇边疯狂的微笑变成了可怕的尖笑声。

_"Asuka,"_ the image of her mother called out to her in a sing-song voice, _"Asuka, won't you come to your mother?"_  
“明日香，”她母亲的影像用唱歌般的语调呼唤她，“明日香，你不来妈妈这里吗？”

_"No!"_ Asuka screamed back in her mind, causing the doll to stop its playing and turn glaring at her, "_I won't! I can't!"_  
"不！" 明日香在心中尖叫回应，使得玩偶停止了玩耍，转而怒视着她，"我不会！我不能！"

_"Now, Asuka, is that any way to talk to your mother? Come, join me!"_ Asuka violently shook her head as the image swung playfully from the rope.  
"现在，明日香，这样跟你妈妈说话合适吗？来，跟我一起！" 明日香猛烈地摇头，那影像在绳子上调皮地晃动。

_"I don't want to! You can't make me!"_ she screamed back, slowly changing into the Asuka of that time, a small, scared little girl.  
"我不想！你不能强迫我！" 她尖叫着回应，渐渐变回了那个时期的明日香，一个害怕的小女孩。

_"Please, Asuka? Come join me, join me in Heaven!"_ her mother called back, as she opened her eyes, revealing glowing, blood red orbs.  
“求你了，明日香？来加入我，和我一起上天堂吧！”她的母亲回应道，当她睁开眼睛，露出闪烁着血红色光芒的眼眸。

_"No, no, no! I don't want to die!"_ little Asuka cried, as she slowly backed away from the open door that lead to the gruesome image. The door kept getting further and further away from her as she turned and tried to run toward it. The awful doll took off in pursuit of Asuka, easily gaining ground as Asuka's little legs pumped as fast as they could. She felt as if she were running in water, her legs just would not move fast enough. The monstrous doll was almost upon her….  
“不，不，不！我不想死！”小小的明日香哭喊着，慢慢从那扇通往可怕景象的门后退。门在她转身试图跑向它时变得越来越远。那可怕的玩偶开始追逐明日香，轻易地缩短了距离，而明日香的小腿拼命地蹬着，快得不能再快。她感觉自己仿佛在水中奔跑，双腿就是无法移动得足够快。那恐怖的玩偶几乎就要追上她了……

Then, she heard it. It was a long, low, sorrowful note, followed soon by others in melodious succession. Asuka turned her head in direction the notes came from, and saw yet another door opening on her right, letting bright light into the dark, blood soaked hallway. Instantly, she dove to her right, just as the doll pounced toward her. The sudden direction change work worked, as she ran screaming for the new doorway, leaving a befuddled doll behind, cursing in the dust. The door slammed shut behind her.  
然后，她听到了。那是一个长长的、低沉的、悲伤的音符，很快又接着其他旋律相继响起。明日香顺着音符的方向转头望去，看到右边又有一扇门打开，明亮的灯光照进了这血迹斑斑的黑暗走廊。她立刻向右扑去，就在玩偶扑向她的瞬间。突然的转向奏效了，她尖叫着向新打开的门跑去，留下一只困惑的玩偶在尘土中咒骂。门在她身后砰然关闭。

Asuka stood looking toward a small hill topped with a large oak tree. The grass was green, and the air smelled sweeter than she had ever known before. A light breeze stirred her hair as she looked all around her. The sunlight was bright, but not unduly so, giving everything before her a warm glow. For the first time in a awful long time, Asuka smiled as she breathed deep the sweet air.  
明日香站在那里，目光投向一座小山丘，山顶上矗立着一棵巨大的橡树。草地绿意盎然，空气比她以往所知的任何时候都要香甜。微风轻拂，吹动她的发丝，她环顾四周。阳光明亮却不刺眼，为眼前的一切披上一层温暖的辉光。在漫长的糟糕时光后，明日香第一次露出了微笑，深深地呼吸着这甜美的空气。

The music she had heard was louder now, but still far off. It drew her hypnotically, toward the hill and it's lone giant, like the song of a Siren to a lost sailor. Feeling like she was floating, Asuka walked toward the mighty oak that called so sweetly to her, until she stood beside it. The music was coming from it, low and sweet, sending waves of pleasure through her tattered mind, bringing rest that she hadn't known in ages.  
她听到的音乐此刻更加响亮，但依然遥远。它像海妖的歌声吸引迷失的水手一样，催眠般地引导她走向山丘和那孤独的巨树。明日香感觉自己仿佛在漂浮，向着那甜美呼唤她的橡树走去，直到她站在树旁。音乐正是从树中传来，低沉而甜美，愉悦的波澜穿透她疲惫的心灵，带来了久违的安宁。

Asuka felt waves of energy pour into her, rejuvenating her injured psyche as she reached out and gently touched the bark of the oak. The music grew more lively, more joyous with every passing note, until she could no longer just stand there. She found a nice spot between two massive roots and sat between them, leaning back against the rough, yet strangely tender bark. She felt that the oak was singing just for her, just to her. It made her feel warm, and loved, and safe.  
明日香感到一股股能量涌入体内，治愈着她受伤的心灵。她伸出手，轻柔地触摸着橡树的树皮。随着每一个音符的流逝，音乐变得更加活泼、更加欢快，直到她再也无法仅仅站在那里。她在两根巨大的树根间找到了一个舒适的位置，坐了下来，背靠在粗糙却莫名温柔的树皮上。她感觉到橡树正为她一人歌唱，只为她一人。这让她感到温暖、被爱，以及安全。

She looked out as song birds flew across the blue sky, adding their voices to the oak's, as they circled one another in a flight of love. One little songbird broke from the pack and landed on one of the roots next to her, lending it's voice to the oak's. It was a little brown bird with gentle blue eyes that seemed to stare straight down into her soul. It felt like it was trying it's best to comfort her and ease her pain. Asuka smiled as a tear of joy slid down her cheek, while the little bird hopped closer to her and settled down on the root. She closed her eyes and relaxed as the little bird snuggled next to her, lending it's warmth to her. She fell into a restful sleep as she traced her hand over some small indentations in the bark, ones that seemed to spell out a familiar name.  
她望向窗外，歌声婉转的鸟儿们掠过蓝天，与橡树的旋律交织，它们在爱的飞翔中相互盘旋。一只小歌鸟从群中飞离，落在她身旁的树根上，加入了橡树的合唱。这是一只棕色的小鸟，拥有温柔的蓝眼睛，仿佛能直视她的灵魂。它似乎在尽力安慰她，减轻她的痛苦。明日香微笑着，喜悦的泪水滑过她的脸颊，小鸟跳得更近，安顿在树根上。她闭上眼睛，放松下来，小鸟依偎在她身边，传递着温暖。她陷入沉睡，手指轻抚树皮上的小凹痕，那些似乎拼出了一个熟悉的名字。

Asuka's eyes snapped open as she realized that she had fallen asleep in her bed and had fallen over. The warm, sweet music she had heard in her mind was here as well. It came from the living room area of the apartment she shared with her roommates. Intrigued, as well as a bit scared, she slowly got up from her bed and, just as in the dream, followed the song to it's source.  
明日香猛地睁开眼睛，意识到自己在床上睡着并翻倒了。那温暖甜美的音乐仍在脑海中回响。它来自她和室友们合租公寓的客厅区域。好奇又有些害怕，她慢慢从床上起身，就像在梦中一样，循着歌声找到了源头。

Slowly, as if afraid to disturb the song, Asuka slid her door open and peeked one blue eye, trying to see what was going on. There was nothing in her immediate line of sight, so she slowly left the room and looked around a bit until the source of the music because clear. Shinji was sitting on the balcony of their apartment, playing his cello, oblivious to anything going on around him. Asuka gasped in shock. This was the music that saved her from the doll. This was the sweet song that relaxed her and soothed her troubled mind. He was the mighty oak in her dream, standing firm and strong, just as he was the little bird that comforted her.  
慢慢地，仿佛生怕打扰了那首歌，明日香轻轻推开自己的门，探出一双蓝眼睛，试图看清发生了什么。她的视线范围内空无一物，于是她缓缓走出房间，四处张望，直到音乐的来源变得清晰。真嗣正坐在他们公寓的阳台上，拉着大提琴，对周围的一切浑然不觉。明日香震惊得倒吸一口气。正是这音乐将她从玩偶的阴影中拯救出来。这是那首甜美悠扬的曲子，让她放松，抚慰她纷乱的心绪。他是她梦境中坚不可摧的橡树，屹立不倒，亦如那只给予她慰藉的小鸟。

Shaking her head to get the disturbing thought out of her mind, she quietly padded to the balcony and slipped out the door to lean against the rail across from him. What she saw when she looked at him surprised her greatly. Shinji's eyes were closed, as tears streamed down his face. A warm, serene smile brightened up his face despite the tears. He seemed to glow as he continued to play his cherished cello, caressing the strings as gently as a he would a lover.  
她摇摇头，试图将这令人不安的念头甩出脑海，然后悄无声息地走向阳台，轻轻推开门，靠在对面栏杆上。当她望向他时，所见情景让她大为惊讶。真嗣双眼紧闭，泪水顺着脸颊滑落。尽管泪流满面，他脸上却洋溢着温暖宁静的微笑。他仿佛在发光，继续演奏着他珍爱的大提琴，指尖轻抚琴弦，温柔如对待爱人。

_"If only he would…no, don't think that way,"_ Asuka mused as she shook her head and leaned back to enjoy the music. Shinji continued to play for several more minutes before the tune gently came to it's end. Stopping, he opened his eyes and saw Asuka sitting on the balcony before him. Her face was more relaxed than he had ever seen it before. Her eyes slowly opened as she noticed the music had ended.  
"要是他愿意……不，别那么想，"明日香自言自语着摇了摇头，靠后坐下享受音乐。真嗣继续弹奏了几分钟，曲调渐渐柔和地结束。他停下，睁开眼睛，看到明日香坐在他面前的阳台上。她的表情比以往任何时候都要放松。她的眼睛慢慢睁开，注意到音乐已经结束。

"Oh, hello Asuka," Shinji stammered as her bright blue eyes locked with his for just a second, before they both turned away, embarrassed. "I didn't hear you come out here. Is everything alright?"  
"哦，你好，明日香，"真嗣结巴着，她明亮的蓝眼睛与他短暂对视，随后两人都尴尬地移开了目光。"我没听到你出来。一切都好吗？"

"Uh? Oh, yeah, everything's fine," she replied as she continued to sit, "I was trying to rest, is all."  
"呃？哦，是的，一切都好，"她回答着继续坐着，"我只是想休息一下。"

"I, I'm sorry," he answered back, slightly nervous, "I guess my playing disturbed you. I didn't mean to play so loud." Shinji sighed as the light that was in his face earlier was extinguished. It broke Asuka's heart to see that.  
"对不起，"他回答道，略显紧张，"我想是我的演奏打扰到你了。我不是故意弹得这么大声的。" 真嗣叹了口气，之前照在他脸上的光线也随之熄灭。这让明日香心碎不已。

"No," she replied, "No, that's okay. It didn't disturb me. I just…." An awkward silence grew between them, before Shinji broke it.  
"不，"她回答说，"不，没关系。并没有打扰到我。我只是……" 两人之间陷入了尴尬的沉默，直到真嗣打破了它。

"Asuka, can I ask you something?" he asked as her heart skipped a beat before recovering. Asuka sighed.  
"明日香，我能问你件事吗？"他问道，她的心跳漏了一拍，随即又恢复正常。明日香叹了口气。

"What is it, Shinji?" she inquired unenthusiastically.  
"什么事，真嗣？" 她无精打采地问道。

"Can, can you forgive me?" Shinji asked with tears in his eyes. He didn't want to cry in front of Asuka and make her think worse of him than she already does. "I wanted to help you against the fifteenth, even though I knew you hate help, but I…"  
"你能，你能原谅我吗？" 真嗣含泪问道。他不想在明日香面前哭泣，让她对他的看法更加糟糕。"我想帮你对抗第十五使徒，尽管我知道你讨厌帮助，但我……"

"Where were you?" Asuka responded both with rage and hurt in her eyes. Shinji was supposed to be there for her, he always had been before. She always said she never needed any help, especially from him, but secretly it made her feel good that he would be there for her, that he _wanted_ to help her.  
"你当时在哪里？" 明日香眼中既有愤怒也有受伤。真嗣本该在她身边的，他以前总是这样。她总是说她不需要任何帮助，尤其是来自他的，但私下里，知道他会为她而在，知道他想要帮助她，这让她感到安心。

"I'm so sorry," Shinji answered as the tears tried to break through, "I really, _really_ wanted to, but that bastard father of mine had my EVA frozen. He refused to let me out! I begged and I screamed, and all he did was sit there while you were…you were…" Asuka was shocked at the emotion he was showing, the total honesty in his eyes. He really _had_ wanted to go out and help her. The venom with which he spoke of his father slammed into with such force that she felt as if she would be crushed under it's weight.  
"我真的很抱歉，" 真嗣回答道，泪水试图冲破眼眶，"我真的，真的很想去的，但那个混蛋父亲把我的 EVA 冻结了。他拒绝让我出去！我哀求，我尖叫，而他只是坐在那里，而你却在……你却在……" 明日香对他的情感表达感到震惊，他眼中的真诚。他真的想出去帮助她。他对父亲说话时的那种刻毒，如此强烈地冲击着她，让她感觉仿佛要被这股力量压垮。

"Just what is going on between you and your father?" she asked, wondering what could be so terrible that he could hate his father so much. Shinji told her.  
"你和你父亲之间到底发生了什么？" 她问道，想知道是什么事情让他如此憎恨自己的父亲。真嗣告诉了她。

He told her the whole story, of his mother's death in the experiment with Unit One, and of his father's abandonment to pursue his quest against the Angels. Shinji told her of living for years without any parental love, the only guidance coming from his teacher, who truly didn't care if Shinji lived or died. All his hate and bitterness showed as he explained to Asuka the circumstances of his mother's death and who was to blame, as well as why he was brought back to Tokyo-3. His hurt tore her as he explained why his father had called him back and how he had treated him since. Her heart ached for him as she realized just how much the two of them were alike.  
他向她讲述了整个故事，关于他母亲在 Unit One 实验中去世，以及他父亲为了对抗使徒而抛弃他。真嗣告诉她，多年来他生活在没有父母之爱的环境中，唯一的指导来自他的老师，而那位老师其实并不在乎真嗣的生死。当他向明日香解释母亲去世的情况、责任归属以及为何被召回东京-3 时，所有的仇恨和苦涩都显露无遗。他解释父亲为何叫他回来以及自那以后如何对待他时，那种痛苦撕裂了她的心。她意识到他们两人是多么相似，心中为他感到痛楚。

"Shinji, I had no idea," she said sadly as she tried to keep a tear from sliding down her face. It was no wonder he rarely showed any spine, and why he felt so worthless.  
“真嗣，我之前完全不知道，”她悲伤地说，努力不让泪水滑落。难怪他很少表现出坚强，难怪他觉得自己毫无价值。

"It's okay, I didn't mean to dump all that on you," he said as he scrunched his eyes shut hard to keep the tears from flowing. "You probably think even worse of me now, huh? I just proved what a weak little child I really am."  
“没关系，我不是有意把这些都倾诉给你的，”他说着，紧闭双眼，努力不让泪水流出。“你现在肯定更看不起我了，对吧？我刚刚证明了，我真是个软弱的小孩。”

"No, Shinji, I don't," Asuka responded as she continued to sit and told him of her story. She told him of her mother, going insane in a contact experiment with Unit Two, and then committing suicide the same day Asuka was selected as a pilot. She told him of a doll replacing her as a child to her mother, and of an uncaring father and stepmother who shuffled Asuka off to live with her grandmother and aunt. She told him of her father's affair with her mother's doctor, and wondering if that was why her mother finally killed herself. She told him of feeling betrayed when her father married that same doctor not long after her mother's death. She told him of how she resolved to never cry again, and having to grow up at such a young age.  
"不，真嗣，我没有，" 明日香继续坐着，向他讲述她的故事。她告诉他关于她的母亲，在一次与二号机的接触实验中精神失常，然后在明日香被选为驾驶员的同一天自杀。她告诉他一个玩偶如何取代了她作为孩子在她母亲心中的位置，以及一个冷漠的父亲和继母如何将明日香送到祖母和阿姨那里生活。她告诉他她的父亲与她母亲的医生有染，并怀疑这是否是她母亲最终自杀的原因。她告诉他，当她的父亲在她母亲去世后不久与那位医生结婚时，她感到被背叛。她告诉他她如何决心再也不哭泣，以及在如此年幼的时候不得不长大。

"Asuka, I am so sorry," he said not with pity, but with sadness. If he could take her pain from her, he would. What really surprised Shinji was how much Asuka had just said to him. They had talked before, but it was about little things, or stuff concerning EVA and the Angels. They had very rarely shred any personal information with each other. Both had feared getting hurt doing so. "So, do you talk to you grandmother and aunt very often?"  
"明日香，我真的很抱歉，" 他说道，不是出于怜悯，而是带着悲伤。如果他能从她那里带走痛苦，他愿意。真正让真嗣惊讶的是明日香刚刚对他说的那么多。他们之前也聊过，但都是些小事，或者关于 EVA 和使徒的事情。他们很少分享任何个人信息。两人都害怕这样做会受到伤害。"那么，你经常和你祖母和阿姨聊天吗？"

"My grandmother died before I came to Japan, and I still get an occasional letter from Aunt Heidi. I do miss her so much, sometimes. I could talk about just anything with that woman. If I was ever close to anyone since my mother, it would be her." she replied, her eyes taking a distant look.  
"我奶奶在我来日本前就去世了，偶尔还会收到海蒂阿姨的信。我真的很想念她，有时候。我可以和那个女人谈论任何事情。如果我在母亲之后与任何人亲近，那一定是她。" 她回答道，眼神变得遥远。

"You miss her, don't you? Your aunt?" Shinji asked, seeing the longing in her eyes as she thought of that time.  
"你想念她，对吧？你的阿姨？" 真嗣问道，看到她在回忆那段时光时眼中的渴望。

"Yeah, sometimes," she answered before her defenses came back up. "But I don't need her! I don't need anyone! Remember that, Third Child!" The fire came back to her eyes as she suddenly stood, fists clinched.  
"是的，有时候，" 她回答，然后防御机制又回来了。"但我不需要她！我不需要任何人！记住这一点，第三适格者！" 她的眼中重新燃起了火焰，突然站起身，紧握双拳。

"I'm sorry, Asuka," he apologized, his normal defense to any sort of confrontation. It just served to irritate her even more.  
"对不起，明日香，"他道歉道，这是他面对任何冲突时的惯常防御。但这只会让她更加恼火。

"What the hell are you sorry for, you idiot?! Is that all you can say to anyone?!" she yelled as Shinji cringed, shaking violently, "You didn't do anything! Why the hell can't you grow up and act like a man for a change? Why can't you just hold…" she stopped herself before she could finish that sentence. _"Why would I want to be held by such an idiot? Just because his music calmed me, because he's kinda cute, because…NO!!"_ Slowly, she calmed down as she leaned back against the railing.  
"你到底在道歉什么，你这个白痴？！你就只会对别人说这句话吗？！"她吼道，真嗣畏缩着，颤抖不已，"你什么都没做！为什么你就不能长大一点，像个男人一样行动一次？为什么你就不能……"她及时打住，没把那句话说完。"我怎么会想被这样一个白痴抱住？就因为他弹的音乐让我平静，因为他有点可爱，因为……不！！"渐渐地，她平静下来，靠在栏杆上。

Shinji closed his eyes and picked up his bow once more, but his fingers refused to obey his instructions. He wasn't able to play anymore, today. He was about to retreat back into his music, but his body betrayed him. Asuka looked at him expectantly, but sorrow seemed to fill her eyes when the music wasn't forthcoming.  
真嗣闭上眼睛，再次拿起弓，但他的手指拒绝听从指令。今天，他无法再演奏了。他本想退回到音乐中，但他的身体背叛了他。明日香期待地看着他，但当音乐没有如期而至时，她的眼中似乎充满了悲伤。

Slowly, she stepped forward and stood beside him, facing the doorway to the apartment, her eyes vacant and far away. Asuka gently reached up and placed her hand on his trembling shoulder, causing him to flinch somewhat, but he didn't pull away. She seemed to deflate.  
她缓缓地走上前，站在他身旁，面对着公寓的门口，眼神空洞而遥远。明日香轻轻地伸出手，放在他颤抖的肩膀上，让他微微一颤，但他并没有躲开。她似乎泄了气。

"Shinji," she said, as the words tried to stick in her throat, "I'm sorry for snapping at you." She heard him gasp at her words, but his trembling subsided. Asuka had feared she had chased the music from the young man, and it was that music that had comforted her, if even for a short time.  
“真嗣，”她艰难地开口，声音卡在喉咙里，“对不起，我刚才对你发火了。”她听到他的喘息声，但他的颤抖平息了。明日香担心自己赶走了那个年轻人的音乐，那音乐曾短暂地安慰过她。

"S'okay," he replied softly, somewhat flabbergasted at her mood change and sudden tenderness. "Can you forgive me?" he asked, desperately. A crack appeared in her inner armour, one that she was going to have to try to repair.  
“没关系，”他轻声回答，对她的情绪转变和突如其来的温柔感到有些惊讶。“你能原谅我吗？”他急切地问。她的内心防线出现了一道裂缝，这道裂缝她必须设法修补。

"I, I don't know yet," she sighed as she took a step toward the door, removing her hand from his shoulder. His heart went heavy at the lose of the touch. With that, Asuka went back into the apartment and tried to watch a little television, before falling into a deep, dreamless sleep on the sofa. She didn't notice Shinji coming back inside with his cherished instrument, nor did she notice when he came back into the living room with a warm blanket. He gently placed it over her sleeping form, tucking her in, and watched over her for a time before he too, went to the land of slumber.  
"我，我还不知道，"她叹了口气，向门口迈了一步，从他的肩膀上移开了手。他的心因失去那份触感而沉重。就这样，明日香回到公寓，试图看一会儿电视，然后在沙发上陷入了深深的、无梦的睡眠。她没有注意到真嗣带着他珍爱的乐器回来，也没有注意到他拿着一条温暖的毯子回到客厅。他轻轻地将毯子盖在她熟睡的身体上，为她掖好，并守望着她一段时间，直到他自己也进入了梦乡。

It was several days before Asuka heard the sweet music again. The horrible memories had stayed hidden until then, slowly trying to pry through the door that the song had erected. It wasn't until that day they had succeeded, and just as they started to pour through, the sweet music started yet again and slammed the door on them. Asuka retreated back to her oak and little bird and sat in peace and comfort once more.  
过了好几天，明日香才再次听到那美妙的音乐。那些可怕的记忆一直隐藏着，直到那时才慢慢试图撬开那首歌所建立的门。直到那天它们才成功，正当它们开始涌入时，那美妙的音乐再次响起，将门重重地关上。明日香退回到她的橡树和小鸟旁，再次坐在宁静与舒适之中。

As before, after a while, she slowly opened her eyes and followed the hypnotic notes to their source. She sat and listened to Shinji play, but this time sat in a corner where he couldn't see her easily. She hoped he would continue to play if he didn't see her immediately. Her hopes were answered as he finished one number and started yet another, then another.  
一如往常，过了一会儿，她缓缓睁开双眼，循着那催眠般的音符找到源头。她坐下来聆听真嗣的演奏，但这次选择了一个角落，让他不易察觉到她。她希望如果他没立刻看到她，会继续弹奏。她的愿望得到了回应，他完成了一曲，又开始了另一曲，接着又是一曲。

Shinji played for at least two hours before coming to an end, a serene smile once more on his face. Asuka's contented sigh interrupted his train of thought when he finished, as he glanced over and saw her sitting so sweetly, totally relaxed. The look on her face was pure bliss, and it tugged at his heartstrings greatly.  
真嗣至少弹奏了两个小时才告一段落，脸上再次浮现出宁静的微笑。当他结束时，明日香满足的叹息打断了他的思绪，他转头看到她如此甜美地坐着，完全放松。她脸上的表情纯粹是幸福，这深深触动了他的心弦。

Afterward, they talked some more, just like that first day, as they got to know each other just a little better. Asuka spoke of the good times she spent with her grandmother and aunt, how she loved to spend time with them in the little village they had lived in. Asuka spent most of the week in school and at NERV's German headquarters, but always spent the weekends with the family. They would go for walks in the Black Forest, or swimming in the local pond. Sometimes they would have dinner in the local _Gausthaus_, and anxiously await the visit of _der brotmann_ every Saturday afternoon. He would always have a warm sweet roll ready for her whenever she bounded down the steps to greet him.  
之后，他们又聊了许久，就像相识的那一天，彼此间的了解又加深了一点点。明日香谈起了与祖母和阿姨共度的美好时光，她多么喜欢在她们居住的小村庄里与她们共度时光。明日香大部分时间在学校和 NERV 的德国总部度过，但每逢周末总会回到家人身边。他们会去黑森林散步，或是在当地的池塘游泳。有时会在当地的酒馆享用晚餐，并热切期待每周六下午面包师傅的到来。每当她欢快地跑下楼梯迎接他时，他总会为她准备好一个温热的甜面包卷。

Shinji filled that little bit of information away for future reference as he told her a little of the time he spent with his teacher. It was mainly depressing, so he tried not to dwell on it. Living with someone that didn't care for you was extremely hard for a young child. It kept you from forming any sort of bond with anyone else. There was no love, no encouragement, no understanding. All there was, was scorn and punishment if he did anything wrong. He never had birthday parties, nor any presents. All he would get would be some money in an envelope from his father, which his teacher would promptly place in his account before the young boy could think of anything to spend it on. Christmases would come and go with no celebrations, no gifts. It was a very lonely life for a small boy.  
碇真嗣将这些零星的信息记在心里，以备将来参考，同时向她讲述了一些与老师共度的时光。那段日子大多令人沮丧，所以他尽量不去深究。对于一个年幼的孩子来说，与一个不在乎你的人生活在一起极其艰难。这让你无法与任何人建立任何形式的联系。没有爱，没有鼓励，没有理解。有的只是轻蔑和惩罚，如果他做错了什么。他从没有过生日派对，也没有收到过礼物。唯一能得到的，就是父亲寄来的信封里的钱，老师会立即存入他的账户，让小男孩来不及想出任何花销的理由。圣诞节来了又去，没有庆祝，没有礼物。对于一个小男孩来说，这是非常孤独的生活。

Asuka felt her heart starting to go out to this lonely young man, who seemed so much like herself. As always, though, the barriers would come back up, but with a few more cracks in them. She had to remember to fix those later, she kept telling herself. As she got ready to leave, her eyes met his once more, locking onto each other. A pleading look in his eyes told of an unanswered question, one she could not answer yet.  
明日香感到自己的心开始向这个孤独的年轻人敞开，他似乎与自己如此相似。然而，一如既往，那些屏障又会重新竖起，只是多了几道裂缝。她不断提醒自己，稍后得修补这些裂缝。当她准备离开时，她的目光再次与他相遇，彼此凝视。他眼中那恳求的神情透露出一个未被回答的问题，一个她目前还无法回答的问题。

"I still don't know yet, I'm sorry." she said as she caressed his shoulder unconsciously, as she stepped once more into the apartment. Shinji's shoulder slumped in defeat, once more.  
“我还是不知道，对不起。”她一边说，一边无意识地抚摸着他的肩膀，再次踏入公寓。真嗣的肩膀因挫败而垂下，又一次。

This continued on for weeks, as every time the haunting memories assaulted her, his music would magically arrive and save her, helping her retreat to the bright world it helped to create. It must have been their sync training at work, again. He knew when she needed the music, so he would provide it. Afterward, they would always talk, until they actually grew to enjoy each other's company, even though Asuka was loath to admit it. Shinji's eyes always held that question, but Asuka still wasn't able to answer him.  
这种情况持续了数周，每当那些令人痛苦的记忆袭来，他的音乐就会神奇地出现，拯救她，帮助她退回到那个由音乐创造的光明世界。这一定是他们的同步训练再次发挥了作用。他知道她何时需要音乐，于是便提供给她。之后，他们总会交谈，直到他们真正开始享受彼此的陪伴，尽管明日香不愿承认这一点。真嗣的眼中总是带着那个问题，但明日香仍然无法回答他。

Eventually, his disappointment faded somewhat as they would talk and spend time with each other. He learned how much she really cared for her aunt in Germany, despite her protests otherwise, and he could see how much it hurt Asuka to be so far away from her. Shinji felt that Asuka needed her now more than ever, and ever so slowly, a plan was beginning to emerge. He had to do this for Asuka, if anything, just to get that fire and energy to come back to her spirit.  
最终，随着他们开始交谈并共度时光，他的失望感逐渐消退。他了解到她对远在德国的阿姨有多么深厚的感情，尽管她嘴上不承认，而他也看到了阿斯卡远离她时的痛苦。真嗣觉得阿斯卡现在比任何时候都更需要她，一个计划正慢慢在他心中成形。他必须为阿斯卡这么做，哪怕只是为了让她心中的火焰和活力重新燃起。

_"I need to talk to Misato,"_ he thought to himself as he struggled with how to go about doing what needed to be done. If everything worked out, Asuka would have a very nice surprise waiting for her very soon. His heart lifted as he went about his task.  
“我得和美里谈谈，”他一边思索着如何着手进行这项必须完成的任务，一边暗自想着。如果一切顺利，阿斯卡很快就会有一个大大的惊喜等着她。当他着手进行这项任务时，心情也随之振奋起来。

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next morning Shinji got up early, trying not to stumble over the boxes that were scattered about the floor, and went to the kitchen to get Asuka's usual Sunday breakfast ready. He hoped that she wasn't still angry at him from last night. He really hadn't known how much his playing had meant to her, and her reaction to the sale of the cello had really shocked him. His chest was still a bit sore from the beating he had gotten at the hands of his redheaded fiancée, but it wasn't anything he couldn't manage.  
第二天早上，真嗣早早起床，尽量不踩到散落一地的箱子，然后去厨房准备明日香惯常的周日早餐。他希望她昨晚没有继续生他的气。他真的不知道自己的演奏对她意味着那么多，而她对大提琴被卖掉的反应也确实让他震惊。胸口因被红发未婚妻揍了一顿还有些隐隐作痛，但这点痛他还能忍受。

After an hour or so, he heard a familiar stirring coming from the bedroom, followed quickly by muffled cursing in German as his lady had obviously forgotten about the mess in the floor. He chuckled a bit as she slid the door open and groggily stumbled to the kitchen.  
大约一小时后，他听到卧室传来熟悉的动静，紧接着是德语的低声咒骂，显然她忘了地板上的混乱。他轻笑一声，看着她拉开移门，睡眼惺忪地摸索到厨房。

"Morning, sleepy," he said cheerfully as she plopped herself down at the table, her eyes still puffy from sleep. He set a cup of tea in front of her before he turned back to the stove. He saw Asuka sniff the air and turn toward the stove, obviously eager to see what was waiting for her inside.  
“早上好，小懒虫，”他愉快地说，她一屁股坐在桌前，眼睛还因睡眠而肿胀。他先在她面前放了一杯茶，然后转身回到炉子旁。他看到明日香嗅了嗅空气，转向炉子，显然急切地想知道里面有什么在等着她。

"Morning," she said groggily. Asuka was beginning to awaken quickly as her stomach told her breakfast was nearly finished. A rather loud growl told Shinji that his ladies were ready for breakfast. "Damn, your daughter's noisy today!"  
“早上好。”她睡眼惺忪地说道。随着肚子提醒她早餐即将完成，明日香很快清醒过来。一声响亮的咕噜声告诉真嗣，他的女士们已经准备好享用早餐了。“该死，你女儿今天真吵！”

"Sure, blame her," Shinji replied as he opened the oven and pulled long pan from within and set it on the stove top. Asuka's mouth was watering. She looked forward to Sunday every week. She still couldn't believe he went through the trouble every single week, just for her. _Der Brotmann_ would be so proud of her Shinji! "Here you go!"  
“当然，怪她吧，”真嗣一边回答，一边打开烤箱，从里面抽出一个长长的烤盘，放在炉灶上。明日香的口水都快流出来了。她每周都期待着星期天。她仍然不敢相信他每周都费心这样做，只为了她。德·布罗特曼先生一定会为她的真嗣感到骄傲！“给你！”

"Dear god, thank you so much!" she beamed as she tore into the sweet rolls he had set before her. He could never understand how much this meant to her.  
“天哪，太感谢你了！”她笑着，迫不及待地撕开他摆在面前的甜面包卷。他永远无法理解这对她意味着什么。

"Must be Sunday," Misato said as she stumbled into the kitchen, following her nose to the delicious aroma. She sat as Shinji handed her a cup of tea and some rolls, as well. "Thanks."  
"肯定是星期天，" 美里一边说着，一边跌跌撞撞地走进厨房，顺着诱人的香气寻去。她坐下后，真嗣递给她一杯茶和一些面包卷。"谢谢。"

"Well, it seems someone has gotten her appetite back," Shinji said as he took place at the table, watching Asuka grab several more rolls and proceed to wolf them down. Asuka was now a little over three months pregnant, and this was the first time in a month he had seen her eat properly at breakfast. Asuka shot him a dirty look.  
"看来某人恢复食欲了，" 真嗣说着，在桌旁坐下，看着明日香又抓了几个面包卷，大口吃了起来。明日香现在已经怀孕三个多月了，这是近一个月来他第一次看到她在早餐时正常进食。明日香瞪了他一眼。

"Jerk," she said between bites. Shinji's face fell a little, something Misato didn't fail to notice.  
"混蛋，" 她边吃边说。真嗣的脸色稍稍沉了下来，这一点美里没有错过。

"I'm just teasing, hon," he said apologetically. She just continued to glare at him. "Are you still mad from last night?"  
"我只是开个玩笑，亲爱的，" 他抱歉地说道。她只是继续瞪着他。"你还在为昨晚生气吗？"

"Well, what the hell do you think?" she said as she spat crumbs all over the table.  
"那你到底怎么想的？" 她一边说一边把面包屑喷得满桌都是。

"What happened last night?" Misato asked, somewhat worried for her children.  
"昨晚发生了什么？" 美里有些担心地问她的孩子们。

"Dumbass here sold his cello!" Asuka growled as she scarfed down another roll.  
"这个笨蛋居然把他的大提琴卖了！" 明日香一边咆哮着，一边狼吞虎咽地吃着另一个面包卷。

"Huh? When?" Misato replied, somewhat shocked at both their actions.  
"啊？什么时候？" 美里回答道，对他们的行为感到有些震惊。

"I told you why I did it," he said defensively, a little hurt she was so upset by it. "I sold it a couple of days ago when I sold my bike, Misato. I wasn't sure how things were going to go, so I sold it too, just to be safe. I didn't mean to hurt you, Asuka! I really didn't know how much it meant to you!"  
"我告诉过你为什么我这么做，" 他有些防御性地回答，对她如此难过感到有些受伤。"我几天前卖掉了我的自行车，顺便也把大提琴卖了，美里。我不确定事情会怎么发展，所以为了安全起见，我也把它卖了。我不是有意要伤害你，明日香！我真的不知道它对你这么重要！"

"It wasn't the cello itself, it was your playing that I'm going to miss! I had wanted to play with you, and I wanted our daughter to hear you play for her!" Asuka replied sadly as Shinji went over and gave her a big hug.  
"不是大提琴本身，而是你的演奏让我会想念的！我一直想和你一起演奏，也想让我们的女儿听你为她演奏！" 明日香难过地回答，而真嗣走过去给了她一个大大的拥抱。

"I am truly sorry, hon," he whispered to her, "How can I make it up to you?" Asuka's face lit up somewhat as she thought of the perfect thing to do.  
"我真的非常抱歉，亲爱的，" 他低声对她说，"我该如何弥补你呢？" 明日香的脸色稍微亮了起来，她想到了一个完美的主意。

"Hmm, you really want to make it up to me? Well, go get dressed! You're taking me shopping!" she said as a malevolent smile creeped across her face. Shinji gulped.  
"嗯，你真的想弥补我吗？那好，快去换衣服！你要带我去购物！" 她一边说，一边脸上露出了狡黠的笑容。真嗣咽了口唾沫。

"Uh, after yesterday, I'm not sure there's anything left in my account!" he stammered as she stood and started to drag him into their room.  
"呃，经过昨天，我怀疑账户里还有没有钱！" 他结结巴巴地说，而她已经站起来开始拉他进房间。

"Oh, don't worry about that," Misato called out , still sitting and enjoying her rolls, "NERV made sure the pay increases and hazard pay were retroactive since you started, so you have plenty in the account!" Shinji stopped in his tracks.  
"哦，别担心那个，" 美里喊道，依旧坐着享受她的面包卷，"NERV 确保了工资和危险津贴从你开始工作时就已追溯增加，所以你账户里有很多钱！" 真嗣停下了脚步。

"How the hell did that happen? I never asked for any of that!" he asked, somewhat shocked.  
"这到底是怎么回事？我可从没要求过这些！" 他有些震惊地问道。

"Believe it or not, it was your father's idea," Misato replied as Asuka succeeded in dragging him the rest of the way into the room.  
"信不信由你，这是你父亲的主意，"美里回答道，而明日香成功地将他拖进了房间。

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"When I agreed to take you shopping, I didn't mean for me!" Shinji protested as they walked back into the apartment after spending the whole morning and most of the afternoon at the Mall. He looked like a walking pile of packages and sacks as he stumbled forward into their home.  
"我答应带你去购物，但没说我也要买！"真嗣抗议着，他们从购物中心逛了一整个上午和大部分下午后回到了公寓。他看起来就像一堆包裹和袋子堆成的行走小山，踉踉跄跄地走进家门。

"Well, I'm not going to allow my husband go walking around dressed like a school boy all the time! I swear, that's all you have in the closet! School uniforms out the ass! Sheesh!" Asuka replied as walked into the living to set down the packages. "I didn't hear you gripe when we went into the music store to get some tapes for your SDAT!"  
"哼，我可不允许我丈夫整天像个学生一样到处走！我发誓，你衣柜里全是校服！满坑满谷的校服！真是的！"明日香边说边走进客厅放下包裹。"我们去音乐店给你买 SDAT 磁带时，我可没听见你抱怨！"

"Now that was a little different...," Shinji said as he almost walked right into Asuka, who had stopped in her tracks.  
"那还真有点不一样...," 真嗣说道，他差点直接撞上了突然停下脚步的明日香。

"_Guten Tag, mein liebling_" called out a familiar voice from the sofa.  
"日安，我的宝贝" 一个熟悉的声音从沙发那边传来。

"Aunt Heidi!" Asuka screamed as she dropped everything and ran to the older woman who stood up next to Misato in the living room. The two embraced long and hard as tears streamed from both sets of eyes. "_Mein Gott!_ What are you doing here?"  
"海蒂阿姨！" 明日香尖叫着，丢下手中的一切，跑向站在客厅里与美里并肩的妇人。两人紧紧相拥，泪水从双方的眼中流淌。"我的天啊！你怎么会在这里？"

"Hello, Heidi!" Shinji called out as he quickly divested himself of all the packages and retreated to the kitchen.  
“你好，海蒂！” 真嗣喊道，他迅速卸下所有包裹，退到厨房。

"Your Shinji called me a week ago and told me that you really needed to see me, so here I am!" she smiled as she held Asuka out at arms length and looked her up and down. "My goodness, you really are filling out!" Aunt Heidi said as she reached down and patted Asuka's little belly.  
“你的真嗣一周前打电话给我，说你真的很需要见我，所以我就来了！” 她微笑着，将明日香伸展开来，上下打量。“天哪，你真的在长胖！” 海蒂阿姨说着，伸手拍了拍明日香的小肚子。

"Uh, well, there's a reason for that," Asuka said sadly as she and her aunt sat down on the sofa."Auntie, there's somethng I need to tell you..."  
“呃，嗯，是有原因的，” 明日香难过地说，她和阿姨一起坐在沙发上。“阿姨，有些事我需要告诉你……”

"I know dear," Heidi said as she patted Asuka's hand, "Misato told me all about it. I am so sorry, child!" Heidi's face was full of sorrow. "So, do you know who the father is? I heard you say something to Shinji about your husband?"  
"我知道，亲爱的，" 海蒂轻拍着明日香的手说，"美里把一切都告诉我了。我真的很抱歉，孩子！" 海蒂的脸上满是悲伤。"那么，你知道孩子的父亲是谁吗？我听到你跟真嗣提到你的丈夫？"

"No, not yet," Asuka replied as Shinji walked into the room carrying glasses of iced tea for everyone, "but I have someone who wants to be the father. He asked me to marry him, and I agreed!"  
"还没有，" 明日香回答道，这时真嗣拿着几杯冰茶走进房间，"但我有个人想成为孩子的父亲。他向我求婚了，我答应了！"

"Oh, really?" Heidi smirked as Shinji did his best to try not to meet Heidi's eye, "Does he love you? Do I know this young man?"  
"哦，真的吗？" 海蒂带着一丝戏谑的笑容，真嗣尽力避免与海蒂对视，"他爱你吗？我认识这位年轻人吗？"

"Uh, yes on both counts," Shinji said as he stood tall beside Misato, sipping his tea,"Me." Heidi stood up and gave Shinji a big hug.  
"嗯，两者都同意，" 真嗣站在美里旁边，啜饮着茶，"我。" 海蒂站起来给了真嗣一个大大的拥抱。

"_Sehr gute, Herr_ Ikari," she whispered in his ear, "You make me very happy and proud!" She pulled back and looked him square in the eye. "You know, when I told you last year to follow your heart, I didn't think you would follow it as far as you have! Just don't hurt Asuka and the baby is all I ask. Understand?"  
"非常好，一尻先生，" 她在他耳边低语，"你让我感到非常高兴和骄傲！" 她后退一步，直视他的眼睛。"你知道吗，去年我让你跟随你的心，我没想到你会追随得这么远！我只求你不要伤害明日香和宝宝。明白吗？"

"_Ich verstehen_," he replied honestly, as he noticed just how much Asuka and Heidi resembled each other. Heidi was a beautiful woman who could easily give Misato a run for her money despite being older than his guardian. Her eyes were the same shade of blue as Asuka's and her hair was just a bit lighter than Asuka's, mainly due to the small amounts of gray mixed in. Shinji knew that this was how the love of his life was going to look as they spent their lives togather growing older. He couldn't ask for anything more.  
"我明白，" 他诚实地回答，同时注意到明日香和海蒂有多么相似。海蒂是一位美丽的女性，即使年纪比他的监护人大，也能轻易与美里一较高下。她的眼睛和明日香一样是蓝色的，头发则略浅一些，主要是混入了少许灰色。真嗣知道，这就是他心爱的人随着他们共度一生逐渐老去的样子。他别无所求。

"Ah, you've been practicing your German," Heidi beamed as she patted his cheek and sat back down beside Asuka."Keep working with Asuka, and you'll speaking like a native in no time!"  
"啊，你在练习德语呢，"海蒂笑着拍了拍他的脸颊，然后坐回明日香身边。"继续和明日香一起学习，你很快就能说得像本地人一样流利了！"

"Only if that native curses every other word...Ow!" Shinji exclaimed as his lady punched him in the leg as he stood next to her once more, glaring at him, "I was just teasing, my love!"  
"除非那个本地人每说两个词就骂一句...哎哟！"真嗣叫道，因为他的女士在他再次站在她身边时捶了他的腿，瞪着他，"我只是开玩笑，亲爱的！"

"I'll deal with you later," she threatened teasingly as Shinji departed to put up the packages and start preparations for dinner. The three ladies stayed in the living room and caught up with each other. Every once in a while, Asuka would look back over her shoulder and watch her fiance' as he busied himself about the kitchen. Everytime she turned back around, the other two women smiled at the silly grin on her face.  
"我晚点再收拾你，"她半开玩笑地威胁道，真嗣则去放好包裹并开始准备晚餐。三位女士留在客厅里互相聊天。偶尔，明日香会回头看一眼她的未婚夫在厨房忙碌的身影。每次她转过身来，另外两位女士都会对她脸上那傻乎乎的笑容报以微笑。

"So, have you set a date yet?" Aunt Heidi asked as everyone sat at the table as Shinji served dinner.  
"那么，你们定下日期了吗？" 海蒂阿姨问道，大家围坐在桌旁，真嗣正在上菜。

"It's in two weeks," Asuka replied as she heaped a good amount of saurkraut onto her plate."Any later than that and the dress may not fit anymore."  
"两周后，" 明日香回答，同时往盘子里盛了一大堆酸菜。"再晚点，婚纱可能就穿不上了。"

"Asuka, that's not a good reason to rush a wedding!" Heidi said, somewhat astonished at her niece's attitude.  
"明日香，这可不是仓促结婚的好理由！" 海蒂说道，对侄女的态度有些惊讶。

"I'd marry him today if I could," Asuka stated blushing just a bit, "I want to get a hold of him before he gets cold feet and backs out!" She smiled at Shinji as she said it. He giggled into his tea glass.  
"如果可以的话，我今天就想嫁给他，" 明日香略带羞涩地说道，"我想在他改变主意之前抓紧他！" 她笑着对真嗣说，他则对着茶杯轻声笑了起来。

"We want to get this over with before word of Asuka's pregnancy gets back to the kids in school," he said as Heidi appraised the young man, "It's probably going to take that long to get the licence, with the two of us being minors and all."  
"我们想在明日香怀孕的消息传到学校孩子们耳朵之前把这事办完，" 他边说边让海蒂打量着这位年轻人，"考虑到我们俩都还未成年，可能得花这么长时间才能拿到许可证。

"Have you told your Papa yet, Asuka?" Heidi asked, then noticed Asuka's face falling just a bit.  
"你告诉过你爸爸了吗，明日香？" 海蒂问道，随即注意到明日香的脸色稍稍沉了下来。

"Not yet," she mumbled softly. Heidi's eyes went wide.  
"还没呢," 她轻声咕哝道。海蒂的眼睛瞪得大大的。

"Asuka! I know you don't get along with your father, but he has to know what is going on! He is your father, after all. Doesn't he have to agree to this marriage for it to proceed?"  
"明日香！我知道你和你父亲关系不好，但他必须知道发生了什么！毕竟他是你父亲。他不同意这门婚事，它还能继续吗？"

"Well, not nessesarily," Misato piped in as everyone at the table turned to look at her. Even Pen-Pen stopped gobbling down fish to stare at her. "Herr Soryu gave up his parental rights when he turned Asuka over to NERV. She's been emancipated for the last several years, but she still needed a guaridan to look over her interests. But it would be a good idea to let him know what's going on, Asuka."  
"嗯，不一定，" 美里插话道，桌旁的每个人都转向她。就连 Pen-Pen 也停止了吞食鱼，盯着她看。"惣流先生在把明日香交给 NERV 时就放弃了他的父母权利。她这几年来一直是自由身，但她仍然需要一个监护人来照顾她的利益。不过，让惣流先生知道发生了什么，对明日香来说是个好主意。"

"What about you, Shinji? Does your father know?" Heidi asked him. Shinji's eyes went cold at the thought of his father.  
"那你呢，真嗣？你父亲知道吗？" 海蒂问他。想到父亲，真嗣的眼神变得冰冷。

"He knows how I feel about Asuka, and he knows I bought the ring. If Section 2 did it's job, he probably knew the second Asuka agreed to marry me. Still, I haven't spoken to him about it yet, and I probably should. He is our military commander, after all." His voice was colder than Asuka or anyone else was used to. It made her shiver.  
"他知道我对明日香的感情，也知道我买了戒指。如果第二课尽职的话，他可能在明日香答应嫁给我的那一刻就知道了。不过，我还没和他谈过这件事，或许我应该去谈谈。毕竟，他是我们的军事指挥官。" 他的声音比明日香或其他任何人习惯的都要冷。这让她打了个寒颤。

"Tell you what, Shinji, you can speak with him after we get done tomorrow," Misato added as she stared into her tea glass, her hands trembling slightly.  
"告诉你吧，真嗣，明天我们忙完了之后，你可以和他谈谈，" 美里一边盯着她的茶杯，一边补充道，她的手微微颤抖。

"It would be as good a time as any," he agreed as he looked over to Asuka, who was deep in thought. "Asuka? Are you alright?"  
"现在正是时候，" 他同意道，目光转向深思中的明日香。"明日香？你还好吗？"

"Huh? Oh, yeah, I'm fine," she lied with a fake smile on her face. The idea of telling her father and stepmother what had happened scared her more than she was about to let anyone know. It didn't fool Shinji one little bit, but he let it slide for now.  
"啊？哦，是的，我没事，" 她带着假笑撒谎道。告诉父亲和继母发生了什么让她比即将让任何人知道的事情还要害怕。这丝毫没有骗过真嗣，但他暂时放过了她。

"So, Shinji," Heidi said with a smile on her face that reminded him of Asuka's most predatory smile, "Have you and Asuka made love yet?" Jaws dropped and tea was spit all over the table as Shinji and Asuka both turned ten shades of red. Misato did her best to keep from laughing, as she had learned from the last time Heidi had visited that she was just a big a tease as Misato.  
"那么，真嗣，" 海蒂带着一个让他想起明日香最具掠食性微笑的笑容说道，"你和明日香已经做过爱了吗？" 真嗣和明日香的脸色都变成了十种红色，茶水喷满了桌子。美里尽力忍住不笑，因为她从上次海蒂来访时就知道她就像美里一样爱捉弄人。

"Aunt Heidi!" Asuka screamed as she slammed her hands on tha table, " No matter how much I called him one, Shinji is NOT a pervert!"  
"海蒂阿姨！" 明日香双手猛拍桌子，尖叫道，"不管我怎么称呼他，真嗣绝不是个变态！"

"It's not perverted if the two people love each other and are engaged," Heidi said innocently as she watched Shinji stumble over an answer to her question.  
"如果两个人相爱并且订婚了，那就不是变态行为，" 海蒂天真地说道，同时观察着真嗣如何结结巴巴地回答她的问题。

"Uh, no we haven't Aunt Heidi," he replied as Heidi smiled brightly at what he had called her, "we've only been engaged for a couple of days, and there is the baby to think about..."  
"呃，没有，海蒂阿姨，" 他回答道，海蒂听到他这样称呼她，脸上绽放出灿烂的笑容，"我们才订婚几天，而且还有宝宝要考虑……"

"I know, Shinji, I was just teasing," Heidi said soothingly, before the smile came back, "It's just Misato has told me you two have been sleeping togather for over a month now, and intercourse during pregnancy is safe if..."  
"我知道，真嗣，我只是在逗你玩，" 海蒂温和地说道，随即笑容再次浮现，"只是美里告诉我你们俩已经同床共枕一个多月了，而且怀孕期间进行性行为是安全的，如果..."

"Aunt Heidi!!" both teenagers screamed as Misato fell over backward out of her chair from laughing so much. "We've only kissed! That's all!" Heidi stared in amazement that two people could say the same thing at the same instant without trying. Finally gaining control overself, Misato got back in her chair with a smile like Heidi's. Asuka and Shinji both knew they let her know too much, and she now had some ammunition which to use against them at the next round of teasing.  
"海蒂阿姨！！" 两个青少年同时尖叫起来，美里因为笑得太厉害而向后摔出了椅子。"我们只是接吻了！仅此而已！" 海蒂惊讶地看着两个人能在不刻意的情况下同时说出同样的话。最终恢复了自控，美里带着和海蒂一样的笑容重新坐回椅子上。明日香和真嗣都知道他们透露得太多了，现在美里有了一些可以用来在下一次调侃中对付他们的弹药。

"Isn't it so cute how they they speak as one already, Heidi?" Misato asked,ever so innocently.  
"他们说话已经如此默契，不是很可爱吗，海蒂？" 美里无比天真地问道。

"Yes, it is," Heid replied, "It's like they've been married for years!" Both women started giggling like fools as the two teenagers fumed.  
“是的，确实如此，”海蒂回答，“他们看起来就像已经结婚多年了！”两位女士像傻瓜一样咯咯笑起来，而那两个少年则气得满脸通红。

After dinner, the ladies pitched in to clean the kitchen since Shinji made such an excellent dinner, leaving him to make a phone call. About thrity minutes later Kaji walked in the door.  
晚餐后，女士们帮忙清理厨房，因为真嗣做了这么美味的晚餐，让他有时间打电话。大约三十分钟后，加持走进了门。

"Kaji!" Mistao screamed as she threw herself in her beloved's arms and planted a big wet kiss on him, which he was more than happy to return. Asuka gave him a big hug and then introduced her Aunt Heidi. Everyone retired to the living room and sat, drinking tea, and talking about everything and anything.  
“加持！”美穗尖叫着扑进她心爱的人的怀里，给了他一个湿漉漉的大吻，他非常乐意地回应了。明日香给了他一个大大的拥抱，然后介绍了她的阿姨海蒂。大家退到客厅坐下，喝着茶，无所不谈。

Finally, Shinji excused himself to the balcony as the three ladies continued to talk amongst themselves like only ladies can. Kaji took the hint and followed Shinji onto the balcony a minute or two later.  
终于，真嗣找了个借口走到阳台上，留下三位女士像只有她们能做的那样继续交谈。加持领会了暗示，一两分钟后也跟着真嗣来到了阳台。

"Nice place," Kaji said as he stood next to Shinji, as both leaned on the rail and looked over the nighttime skyline of Tokyo-3.  
“好地方，”加持说着，站到真嗣旁边，两人都倚在栏杆上，俯瞰着夜晚的第三新东京市天际线。

"Yeah, it's great," Shinji said, sounding both nervous and happy at the same time. Kaji noticed this.  
“是啊，真不错，”真嗣说道，语气中既紧张又高兴。加持注意到了这一点。

"Not having second thoughts, are you?" Kaji said worriedly. He hoped that things would work out better for the two kids than it did with he and Misato.  
"没有后悔吧，你？" 加持担忧地说道。他希望这两个孩子能比他和美里更顺利。

"Huh? No! Not at all," he said, still a little nervous, "I'm just a little worried about talking to my father tomorrow."  
"啊？没有！一点也没有，" 他仍然有些紧张，"我只是有点担心明天和父亲谈话。"

"Really? After facing him down the other day, I thought that you would never have that problem again." Kaji replied.  
"真的吗？上次你面对他之后，我还以为你不会再有这种问题了。" 加持回答道。

"This is different, I guess. Last time, it was concerning Asuka and the baby's well being. This time is a little different. I'm going to tell him about the marriage, and ask for his blessing."  
"这回情况不同了，我想。上次是关于明日香和宝宝的安危。这次则有些不同。我要告诉他关于结婚的事，并请求他的祝福。"

"Ah, I see," Kaji said, "you realize he probably already knows, and if he objected, you would have found out by now."  
"啊，我明白了，" 加持说，"你该知道他很可能已经知道了，如果他反对，你早就该察觉到了。"

"True," Shinji said, as he hung his head," it's just, I would like his approval. It's stupid, I guess. I've never had his approval or blessing for anything before in my life, but this is different! I can't really explain it."  
"确实，" 真嗣低着头说，"只是，我希望能得到他的认可。或许很傻吧。我这辈子从未得到过他的认可或祝福，但这次不一样！我无法真正解释清楚。"

"It's not stupid, Shinji," the older man replied as he laid a hand on Shinji's shoulder, "He's your father, and all children want approval from their fathers, whether they admit it or not. I personally think he gave up any and all claims of being your father years ago, but still, he is." Shinji just nodded his head.  
"这并不愚蠢，真嗣，" 年长的男人回答，同时将手放在真嗣的肩膀上，"他是你的父亲，所有孩子都渴望得到父亲的认可，无论他们是否承认。我个人认为他多年前就放弃了作为你父亲的任何权利，但无论如何，他确实是。" 真嗣只是点了点头。

"Kaji, I have a question to ask of you. Well, a favor really." Shinji said seriously.  
"加持，我有件事想请你帮忙。其实，是个请求。" 真嗣认真地说道。

"Sure, what is it?" Kaji replied, not having any idea what the young man had up his sleeve.  
"当然，是什么事？" 加持回答，完全不知道这个年轻人葫芦里卖的是什么药。

"Kaji, would you stand up with me?" Shinji asked. Kaji just stood there, not know what the young man meant.  
"加持先生，您愿意和我一起站在这里吗？" 真嗣问道。加持只是站在那里，不明白这个年轻人的意思。

"What do you mean?" Kaji replied, it still not clicking in his head. Shinji chuckled.  
"你是什么意思？" 加持回答，他还是没反应过来。真嗣轻声笑了。

"Misato's right, your mind just goes blank when it comes to weddings! I'm asking if you'll be my best man." Shinji said with a smile at the look of shock that covered Kaji's face.  
"美里说得对，一提到婚礼你的脑子就一片空白！我是问你愿不愿意做我的伴郎。" 真嗣笑着说，看着加持脸上震惊的表情。

"Huh? Whoa," the older man said as he backed up and sat on one of the chairs. "I'm flattered, Shinji, but shouldn't you ask one of your friends?"  
"嗯？哇哦，"年长的男人一边后退一边坐在其中一把椅子上。"我受宠若惊，真嗣，但你不是应该问问你的朋友们吗？"

"I just did," Shinji said as he smiled at the older man's discomfort."Look, Kaji, you're the closest thing I have to an older brother, or a...a father. I count you as one of my friends. You have helped me and my family out in so many ways it's not even funny. I concider you part of my family. So, what do you say, brother?" Kaji looked back into the apartment at his lady, sitting there and looking so happy, talking to Asuka and her Aunt. Shinji's family. His family.  
"我刚刚问了，"真嗣笑着看着年长男人的局促不安。"听着，加持，你是我最亲近的兄长，或者说...父亲。我把你当作我的朋友之一。你以各种方式帮助我和我的家人，简直数不胜数。我把你视为我的家人。所以，你怎么说，兄弟？"加持回头望向公寓里他的女士，坐在那里看起来很开心，和明日香以及她的阿姨聊天。真嗣的家人。他的家人。

"It would be my pleasure, Mr. Ikari," Kaji said has he shook Shinji's hand. Shinji's smile grew a mile wide. "Now, you realize, I really _have_ to arrange your bachelor party now!" Kaji laughed as Shinji's smile was followed by a blush that would kill a horse. Kaji looked at back at Misato once more, and saw her smiling sweetly at him, like she knew what was going on. "Did you say anything to Misato about this?"  
"我很荣幸，碇先生，"加持说着握住了真嗣的手。真嗣的笑容扩大了好几倍。"现在，你得知道，我真的得安排你的单身派对了！"加持笑着，真嗣的笑容之后是一阵足以让马匹倒下的脸红。加持再次看向美里，看到她正甜蜜地对他微笑，仿佛知道发生了什么。"你跟美里提过这事吗？"

"No, but she's as sharp as a well honed katana, I have a feeling she knows what is going on out here," Shinji said as he waved to his roommate, who quickly turned back to the conversation indoors. Kaji looked at her a little sadly, before the mask came back out and Kaji appeared normal again. Shinji didn't miss it. "Kaji, may I ask a personal question?"  
“不，但她就像一把磨得锋利无比的武士刀，我有种感觉，她知道外面发生了什么，”真嗣说着向他的室友挥手，后者迅速转身回到室内的对话中。加持略带忧伤地看了她一眼，随后面具再次戴上，加持又恢复了常态。真嗣没有错过这一幕。“加持，我可以问一个私人问题吗？”

"Ask away, my friend, but I'm not promising I'm going to answer," Kaji replied, chuckling somewhat, "nature of the buisness, you know!" Shinji joined in the chuckle before becoming serious once more.  
“问吧，我的朋友，但我可不保证会回答，”加持笑着回答，语气中带着几分调侃，“你知道的，工作性质使然！”真嗣也跟着笑了笑，随后再次严肃起来。

"What really happened between you and Misato when you were kids? I've heard parts of the story from Misato back when she used to get drunk, but something was always missing." Shinji asked with genuine concern in his voice. He desperately wanted to help his friends, but he couldn't understand the deep hurt that seemed to keep them apart, even though they themselves were engaged. Neither Kaji nor Misato had ever pressed to set a date.  
“你和美里小时候到底发生了什么？我从美里喝醉时听到了一些片段，但总感觉少了些什么。”真嗣带着真切的关心问道。他迫切想要帮助他的朋友们，但他无法理解那种似乎将他们分隔开的深深伤痛，尽管他们已经订婚。无论是加持还是美里，都从未催促过确定婚期。

"Ah. Well..." Kaji started, then sat there lost in thought. Shinji started to get a little nervous.  
“啊，这个……”加持开始说道，随即陷入沉思。真嗣开始感到有些紧张。

"Look, Kaji, I'm sorry if I seem to be prying. I guess it's really none of my buisness. Forget about it." Shinji said quickly as he tried to avoid the older man's eyes.  
“听着，加持先生，如果我显得多管闲事，我很抱歉。我想这真的不关我的事。忘了它吧。”真嗣迅速说道，试图避开年长者的目光。

"No, no that's alright. I just have never spoken to anyone else about it before, not even Ritsuko. Believe it or not, she used to be a dear friend to Misato and I back at the University, but there are some hurts that just go too deep." Kaji replied.  
“不，不，没关系。我只是从未对其他人提起过这件事，甚至包括律子。信不信由你，她曾经是美里和我在大学时的好朋友，但有些伤痛实在太深了。”加持回答道。

"I'm sorry, Kaji. Let's just forget about it." Shinji apologized. Kaji held his hand up.  
"对不起，加持先生。我们还是忘掉这件事吧。" 真嗣道歉道。加持举起手示意。

"Like I said, that's alright. You concider me your friend and a member of your family, and family shouldn't have any secrets from each other. You know that Misato and I broke up after being with each other for a very long time."  
"就像我说的，没关系。你把我当作朋友和家人，家人之间不应该有秘密。你知道，美里和我在一起很长时间后分手了。"

"She's said something about it before, something about you reminding her too much of her father. She told me she ran away as fast as she could," Shinji replied. Kaji nodded his head.  
"她之前提到过，说你让她想起了太多她父亲的事。她告诉我，她尽可能快地逃离了，" 真嗣回答。加持点了点头。

"That was just a part of it, Shinji," the older man continued as he glanced back at Misato,"Back when we were...togather...we weren't exactly careful. We once spent an entire week in bed togather. Well, something happened."  
"那只是其中一部分，真嗣，"年长的男人继续说道，同时回头看了一眼美里，"在我们还在一起的时候...我们并不总是那么小心。有一次，我们整整一周都腻在床上。嗯，发生了一些事情。"

"Oh crap," Shinji replied, eyes wide as understanding dawned on him.  
"哦，糟了，"真嗣回答道，眼睛睁得大大的，恍然大悟。

"My thoughts exactly," Kaji sighed as he thought back on those days. "Misato got pregnant. We were both stunned, we weren't ready for that kind of responsibilty!" Shinji just nodded his head.  
"我也是这么想的，"加持叹了口气，回忆起那些日子。"美里怀孕了。我们都惊呆了，我们还没准备好承担那种责任！"真嗣只是点了点头。

"Scary as hell, wasn't it?" Shinji added. Kaji smiled at his friend's understatement.  
"真是吓人至极，不是吗？" 真嗣补充道。加持对他的轻描淡写报以微笑。

"To say the least. Things got a little...tense...between the two of us." Kaji said as he stood up and paced to the railing once more. "We fought like cats and dogs, but the biggest battle was with myself. I wanted to do the right thing, the noble thing. Like you, young Mr. Ikari." Kaji sighed sadly.  
"这么说都算轻的。我们俩之间变得有点...紧张...了。" 加持说着站起身，再次踱步到栏杆旁。"我们像猫狗一样争吵，但最大的战斗是对抗自己。我想做正确的事，高尚的事。就像你，年轻的碇君。" 加持悲伤地叹了口气。

"I haven't done anything noble, Kaji. I just followed my heart, that's all." Shinji replied. Kaji laughed and shook his head.  
"我并没有做什么高尚的事，加持。我只是跟随我的心，仅此而已。" 真嗣回答。加持笑了笑，摇了摇头。

"Once more you underestimate yourself, Shinji. Maybe being married to Asuka will cure you of some of that!" He and Shinji both chuckled at that. "Anyway, Misato was having difficulties early on in her pregnancy. It scared me badly. I feared I was going to lose both of them. Finally...finally I made up my mind, I was going to ask for Misato's hand. But..."  
"再次低估了自己，真嗣。或许和明日香结婚能治好你这一点！" 他和真嗣都为此笑了笑。"总之，美里怀孕初期遇到了不少困难。那让我非常害怕，担心会失去她们两个。最终...我终于下定决心，要向美里求婚。但是..."

"I'm sorry, Kaji," Shinji said, guessing at what had happened.  
"对不起，加持先生，" 真嗣说道，猜测着发生了什么。"

"That's okay, Shinji, it was long ago. Well, we lost the baby. Misato blamed herself. She was afraid that whatever happened to her in Antarctica was to blame. Me? I blamed myself. I alway wondered if maybe I had been a man instead of a scared little boy then maybe my little boy would have survived." Kaji swallowed the lump that had formed in his throat. "It...broke...Misato. It wasn't too long afterward that she ran from me. Shinji, promise me that, no matter what may happen to either Asuka or the baby, you will be there for her. If anything happens, don't abandon her."  
"没关系，真嗣，那是很久以前的事了。我们失去了那个孩子。美里责怪自己，她害怕南极发生的事是罪魁祸首。而我，我也责怪自己。我总是在想，如果我当时是个男人而不是一个害怕的小男孩，也许我的孩子就能活下来。" 加持咽下了喉咙里形成的硬块。"那...击垮了...美里。没过多久，她就从我身边逃走了。真嗣，答应我，无论明日香或孩子发生什么，你都要在她身边。如果有任何事发生，不要抛弃她。"

"I'll always be there, Kaji," Shinji promised wholeheartedly. The idea of anything happening to their baby tore at his heart, but he knew it would be worse for Asuka. He loved her more than anyone or anything. He would never leave.  
"我会一直在你身边，加持，" 真嗣真诚地承诺道。想到他们的孩子可能会遭遇不测，他的心被撕裂了，但他知道这对明日香来说会更糟糕。他爱她胜过任何人或任何事。他永远不会离开。

"You know, it sound sappy," Kaji said with a smile as he ruffled the younger man's hair, "if my boy had survived, I would hope he would turn out to be a fine young man like yourself!" Kaji knew that Shinji was blushing from the heat he felt rising from his face. "So! Whom else do you plan on having as your groomsmen?" The two of them continued to talk for a while before they retired back to the living room and Kaji said his goodbyes, giving his lady love a long slow goodbye kiss.  
"你知道，这听起来有点肉麻，" 加持笑着说，同时揉乱了年轻人的头发，"如果我的儿子活下来了，我希望他能像你一样成为一个优秀的年轻人！" 加持知道真嗣的脸因为热气而泛红。"那么！你还打算邀请谁做伴郎呢？" 两人继续聊了一会儿，然后回到客厅，加持道别，给了他的爱人一个漫长而缓慢的告别吻。

"Soon," he said as Misato gasped in shock as Kaji made his way to the door and walked out into the dark night.There was a bounce in his step that hadn't been there for a very, very long time.  
"很快，" 他说道，美里震惊地倒吸一口气，加持走向门口，步入漆黑的夜色中。他的步伐中带着久违的轻快。

### Chapter 3
Kaji finally made it up to his own apartment after visiting Misato and the others. He was bone tired, and not just from the long day of work he had put in. Shinji had really thrown him for a loop, asking him to be his best man. Seeing the young man grow up and take on such responsibility had put thing in perspective for Kaji. He had meant what he had said to Misato, soon the two of them would set a date and settle down. It was time for the two of them to grow up.  
拜访美里等人后，梶终于回到了自己的公寓。他已经筋疲力尽了，不仅仅是因为一整天的工作。真嗣真的让他大吃一惊，要求他做他的伴郎。看到这个年轻人长大并承担起这样的责任，卡吉开始重新看待事情。他对美里说的话是认真的，很快两人就定下日期并安顿下来。两人也到了该长大的时候了。

Kaji made it to his bedroom and took off his shirt and threw it to the floor. He absentmindedly rubbed the large, misshapen scar on his chest. It had been well over a year since he had been shot on orders from SEELE, but the wound still hurt from time to time. The constant rain in Tokyo-3 didn't help much. Kaji felt somewhat disappointed that the old men had sent such an amateur to try to dispose of him, after all, all the pros knew to take head shots because you never knew if someone wore a bulletproof vest or not.  
加治回到他的卧室，脱下衬衫扔到地板上。他心不在焉地揉着胸口那块巨大的、畸形的伤疤。距离他奉SEELE的命令被枪杀已经一年多了，但伤口仍然不时疼痛。第三东京的持续降雨并没有多大帮助。梶有些失望，老人们派了这么一个业余的人来对付他，毕竟职业选手都知道爆头，因为你永远不知道一个人是否穿了防弹衣。

To the assassin's credit, though, he did use armour piercing ammunition. The bullet ripped through the vest and tore into Kaji's shoulder, leaving a rather messy and jagged hole. Despite the pain and lose of blood, Kaji was able to pull his own pistol and scatter the assassin's brains all over the walls. With a call to a trusted member of Section 2, Kaji was extracted and tended to by Gendo Ikari's personal doctor. Soon, Kaji was up and about, setting plans into motion. Kaji could remember the Day of Truth like it happened just yesterday….  
不过，值得称赞的是，他确实使用了穿甲弹药。子弹穿过背心，撕裂了加持的肩膀，留下了一个相当凌乱且锯齿状的洞。尽管承受着痛苦和失血，加持还是拔出了自己的手枪，将刺客的脑浆打得满墙都是。在给第二课一位值得信赖的成员打电话后，梶被救了出来，并由碇源堂的私人医生进行治疗。很快，加治就站了起来，开始制定计划。加治对真理之日的记忆就像昨天发生的一样……

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Late December,2015 2015年12月下旬_

"The old men sent an Angel to us," Commander Fuyutsuki fumed as he paced back and forth behind Commander Ikari's desk. As for the Commander himself, he sat behind his desk, looking as immutable as ever, his hands covering the lower part of his face.  
“老人们派了一位天使来找我们。”冬月中校在碇中校的办公桌后面来回踱步，怒气冲冲地说道。至于指挥官本人，则坐在办公桌后面，双手捂着下脸，表情一如既往的一成不变。

"Yes, it seems that the old fools want to move the timetable forward. This is something we cannot allow if the scenario is to go according to our will," Ikari replied as he touch a small button in his desk.  
“是的，看来那些老傻瓜想把时间表提前。如果剧情要按照我们的意愿进行的话，这是我们不能允许的。”碇一边回答，一边按下了办公桌上的一个小按钮。

"Will the destruction of Unit 00 cause any harm to the schedule?" Fuyutsuki asked as he read the little data pad he pulled from his pocket. A look of concern crossed his face, adding to the wrinkles that already lined his face.  
“00号机组被毁会对进度造成什么影响吗？”冬月一边读着从口袋里掏出的小数据板一边问道。脸上浮现出担忧的神色，脸上本来就已经布满了皱纹。

"A minor nuisance, that is all," the Commander said, "As long as Unit-01 remains intact and in our control. The other Units are secondary concerns, only useful to fight the Angels."  
“一点小麻烦，仅此而已，”指挥官说道，“只要 01 号部队完好无损并在我们的控制之下。其他部队都是次要问题，只对对抗天使有用。”

"There aren't supposed to be anymore Angels after the Seventeenth, are there?" Fuyutsuki asked as he consulted his pad once more. It disturbed him that he didn't have any more reliable data.  
“十七号之后就不应该再有天使了，是吗？”冬月再次查阅笔记本问道。令他不安的是，他没有更可靠的数据。

"Our knowledge of the Dead Sea Scrolls is incomplete, even the fools at SEELE admit this. Unfortunately, they believe that their interpretations and extrapolations are correct, and will do anything to advance their conclusion. They are just power hungry, feeble old men who wish to grasp at glory. They fail to see the bigger picture. There may be other Angels, we just don't know yet," Ikari stated as he shook his head slightly. "What disturbs me is Rei's attitude. From what Dr. Akagi has said, she seems to have stopped taking her medications, and is developing a sense of self. This goes against just about everything in our scenario. We cannot allow Rei to break from our grip!"  
“我们对死海古卷的了解是不完整的，就连SEELE的傻瓜也承认这一点。不幸的是，他们相信自己的解释和推断是正确的，并且会不惜一切代价来推进他们的结论。他们只是渴望权力、虚弱的老人，他们无法看到更大的前景，也许还有其他天使，我们只是还不知道。”碇微微摇头说道。 “令我不安的是丽的态度。从赤城医生的说法来看，她似乎已经停止服用药物，并且正在形成一种自我意识。这与我们场景中的一切都背道而驰。我们不能让丽突破自己的束缚。”我们的握力！”

'Would it have been better if she had died, Commander?" Fuyutsuki asked. "If your son hadn't saved her from the Sixteenth, we could have activated a spare and not have to worry about her gaining her own free will."  
“指挥官，如果她死了会更好吗？”冬月问道，“如果你的儿子没有从十六团手中救出她，我们就可以激活一个备用，而不必担心她获得自己的自由意志。”

"I'm surprised to hear you say something like that, sensei. You are beginning to sound too much like me," Ikari replied as he felt the older man shiver.  
“我很惊讶听到你说这样的话，老师。你听起来太像我了，”碇回答道，他感觉到老人在颤抖。

"Perish the thought," Fuyutsuki muttered as he stopped his pacing and reflected on what he had said.  
“打消这个念头吧。”冬月停下脚步，反思自己的话，低声说道。

"To answer your question, it would take too much time to get a spare ready for what is needed. This one has already synced with an EVA, despite that EVA's destruction. She has embraced her human half somewhat, being in such close proximity to her brother, and myself. That should make her easier to control when the time comes. Family bonds are the hardest to break."  
“回答你的问题，准备一个备用的需要太多时间。这个已经与 EVA 同步了，尽管 EVA 被破坏了。她已经在某种程度上拥抱了她的人类一半，与她如此接近。当家庭纽带最难打破时，这应该会让她更容易控制。”

"You seem to have had no such problem with breaking family bonds," Fuyutsuki observed, " you have next to no relationship with your own son. How are you able to have a relationship with a clone of your wife and Lilith?"  
“你似乎没有遇到过破坏家庭纽带的问题，”冬月观察到，“你和你自己的儿子几乎没有关系。你怎么能和你妻子和莉莉丝的克隆人建立关系呢？”

"Yui wanted a son, not I. I had hoped for a daughter, and got one in Rei. If Dr. Akagi's mother hadn't killed herself after murdering the first Rei, I would have done so gladly. The Third and I have never had a relationship, period. Nor am I inclined to start one." Gendo said flatly.  
“唯想要一个儿子，而不是我。我本来希望有一个女儿，并在丽那里得到了一个。如果赤城博士的母亲没有在谋杀第一个丽后自杀，我会很高兴这样做。第三个和我已经从来没有建立过一段关系，就这样，我也不想开始一段关系。”源堂淡淡的说道。

"My, my! And you said Commander Fuyutsuki was cold! I do believe the air temperature dropped fifty degrees just now," a voice called out in the darkness. Ikari and Fuyutsuki both looked up. Out of the darkness walked a form that Commander Fuyutsuki thought he would never see again. The shock was plain on his face.  
“天哪，天哪！你还说冬月司令很冷！我相信刚才气温下降了五十度。”黑暗中传来一个声音。碇和冬月同时抬起头来。冬月司令以为自己再也见不到的身影从黑暗中走了出来。他的脸上写满了震惊。

"Welcome, Agent Kaji," Ikari called back, "your snide remarks serve no purpose here. I have called you for a reason."  
“欢迎，梶特工，”碇里回道，“你的讽刺言论在这里没有任何意义。我给你打电话是有原因的。”

"I, I thought you were dead," Fuyutsuki stammered as he watched the young man standing before him. He was sure SEELE was going to kill Kaji for saving him from the Committee's clutches.  
“我、我以为你死了。”冬月看着站在自己面前的年轻人，结结巴巴地说。他确信SEELE会杀死卡吉，因为卡吉将他从委员会的手中救了出来。

"Well, it wasn't for lack of trying," Kaji answered, his chest and shoulder still very sore, even though his arm was immobilized in a sling. He refused pain medication, knowing that he would need his wits about him the next few months to survive. "So, what can I do for you, Commander?"  
“嗯，这并不是因为缺乏尝试，”卡吉回答道，尽管他的手臂被吊带固定住了，但他的胸部和肩膀仍然很酸痛。他拒绝服用止痛药，因为他知道在接下来的几个月里他需要靠自己的智慧才能生存。 “那么，指挥官，有什么可以帮您的吗？”

"You have heard our conversation, I take it" Ikari stated as fact, not as a question.  
“我认为你已经听到了我们的谈话。”碇表示这是事实，而不是问题。

"Indeed I have," Kaji replied, delighted to have gathered more knowledge, after all, that is an agent's job. "I take it SEELE wants to throw a wrench in your plans to advance their own, and you need me to slow them down."  
“确实有，”加治回答道，很高兴能收集到更多的知识，毕竟那是特工的工作。 “我认为 SEELE 想要破坏你们推进自己的计划，而你们需要我来减缓他们的速度。”

"I need you to stop them, period." Gendo replied, trying to repress a smile. "It is time to start Operation: Gotterdammerung. Make the necessary arraignments. I want you to deal with Chairman Kihl personally."  
“我需要你阻止他们，就这样。”源童回答道，试图抑制住笑容。 “是时候开始行动了：诸神黄昏。进行必要的传讯。我希望你亲自去见基尔主席。”

"What?" Fuyutsuki gasped, as the implications of what Ikari had just said sunk in. "You wish to destroy the heads of SEELE? Who will run it then? How do you know that SEELE won't retaliate?"  
“什么？”冬月倒抽一口冷气，明白了碇刚才的话的含义。“你想毁掉SEELE的头颅？那么谁来管理它？你怎么知道SEELE不会报复？”

"I will control it, Kozo," the Commander replied, "I have spent the last ten years positioning my pieces on the board, now is the time to attack and checkmate the opposition. I have my own agents in place to move up into the 'vacated' positions. Rest assured, they are all loyal to me and will do as I say."  
“我会控制它，Kozo，”指挥官回答道，“过去十年我一直在棋盘上放置我的棋子，现在是时候攻击并围堵对手了。我有自己的特工，可以向上移动到棋盘上。” ‘空出来的’职位放心，他们都会效忠于我，并且会按照我说的去做。”

"The Fall of the Gods, hmm? Well, after my treatment at their hands, it will be a pleasure, Commander," Kaji said as he bowed. "After this is over, all I ask is that I can reveal myself and come out of hiding."  
“诸神的陨落，嗯？好吧，在我接受了他们的治疗之后，我将很荣幸，指挥官。”卡吉鞠了一躬说道。 “这一切结束后，我所要求的只是我可以暴露自己并从隐藏中走出来。”

"That shouldn't present a problem, Agent. Just make sure the job is done properly, and you may go back to your precious Major," Ikari said as a way to dismiss the Agent. Kaji returned to the shadows without a sound, leaving Gendo and Kozo alone.  
“这不应该成为问题，特工。只要确保工作顺利完成，你就可以回到你宝贵的少校身边了，”碇说，以此作为解雇特工的一种方式。加持无声无息地回到了阴影中，只剩下源堂和耕三一人。

"Will you keep your promise, Ikari?" Fuyutsuki asked, worried about the young man that just left.  
“碇，你会遵守诺言吗？”冬月担心刚刚离开的年轻人问道。

"I find no reason not to," the Commander replied, "with SEELE under my control, we will have plenty of time to refine and implement our scenario, rather that trying to rush and beat the Committee to the punch. All will go as I have planned," Ikari said with a cold smile on his face. Fuyutsuki had his doubts, but rather than voice them, he merely stood behind his commander and held his tongue.  
“我没有理由不这样做，”指挥官回答道，“有了 SEELE 在我的控制下，我们将有足够的时间来完善和实施我们的方案，而不是试图赶在委员会之前采取行动。一切都会按计划进行。”我已经计划好了。”碇脸上带着冷笑说道。冬月心中有疑虑，但他并没有将其表达出来，只是站在指挥官身后沉默不语。

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_The Present 现在_

Kaji smiled as he crawled under the covers and snuggled down into his bed. Ikari's plan went so much better than anyone had hoped. Kaji savored the memory of Chairman Kihl's face as a 'dead' agent stood before him and put a steel tipped bullet in that cybernetic skull of his. The rest of the leaders of SEELE went down just as quickly, as Kaji had contacted all the members of his handpicked black-op squad. Each and every one of them were loyal to Kaji and the cause, and seeing how helping Ikari at this juncture fell right into their plans, there were no difficulties.  
加治微笑着爬进被子，依偎在床上。碇的计划比任何人预想的都要顺利。卡吉回味着基尔主席的脸，一名“死去”的特工站在他面前，将一颗钢头子弹射进了他的控制论头骨。当梶联络了他精心挑选的黑色行动小队的所有成员时，SEELE 的其他领导人也同样迅速倒下。他们每个人都忠于加持和事业，看到在这个节骨眼上帮助碇里正好符合他们的计划，没有什么困难。

Within an hour of the simultaneous assassinations, Gendo Ikari had the whole of SEELE under his thumb. As predicted, every one of the replacements were his own loyal slaves, and as his first act in ensuring his power, all known and suspected agents of the dead men were quickly eliminated, including many of the Section 2 agents that worked for NERV. After two days, Gendo Ikari was completely secure in his own powerbase. There would be no more hassles over money, no more interference in his plans, no more questions over his motives, and no more having to worry about being assassinated in his own headquarters. He felt secure for the first time in a very long time.  
在同时发生的暗杀事件发生后的一个小时内，碇源堂就掌控了整个 SEELE。正如预料的那样，每一个替代者都是他自己忠实的奴隶，作为他确保权力的第一步，所有已知和可疑的死者特工都很快被消灭，包括许多为 NERV 工作的第 2 部特工。两天后，碇源堂的权力基础已经完全稳固。不会再有金钱上的麻烦，不会再有人干涉他的计划，不会再有人质疑他的动机，也不会再担心在自己的总部被暗杀。很长一段时间以来，他第一次感到安全。

As long as the Commander was happy, he wouldn't be looking as hard for any signs of subversion, which made Kaji happy and his job much easier. Ikari kept his word and allowed Kaji to come out of hiding, leading to a very joyful and tearful reunion with his friends, especially with a certain Major who shall remain Misato. Kaji's heart warmed at the memory of he and Misato telling each other how much they loved each other at their reunion. There had been some rough spots since then, but there is in any relationship, especially in a relationship as complicated as theirs has been.  
只要指挥官高兴，他就不会那么努力地寻找任何颠覆的迹象，这让梶很高兴，他的工作也轻松多了。碇信守诺言，允许梶从躲藏处现身，与他的朋友们，特别是与一位仍将是美里的少校重聚，他们感到非常高兴和热泪盈眶。想起他和美里在重聚时互相诉说彼此有多么相爱，梶心里暖暖的。从那时起，出现了一些困难，但在任何关系中都存在，尤其是在像他们这样复杂的关系中。

Kaji sighed as he thought about Shinji and Asuka. _"Talk about a complicated relationship,"_ Kaji thought to himself. He had always known Shinji had feelings for the fiery redhead, but he was never sure if Asuka would ever respond, despite the fact everyone knew she had feelings for him. She had changed so much since she had awakened from her coma that Kaji found it hard to believe it was the same girl he had brought to Tokyo-3, and Kaji knew he had a certain young man to thank for that. Her attitude wasn't near as abrasive as it once was, and certainly less so know that she was pregnant and engaged to the young man she loved. The scared little girl was still there, but she wasn't afraid to get close to people now.  
梶想到真嗣和明日香，叹了口气。 “谈论一种复杂的关系，”加治自言自语道。他一直都知道真嗣对火红发女郎有感情，但他不确定明日香是否会做出回应，尽管事实上每个人都知道她对他有感情。自从她从昏迷中醒来后，她发生了很大的变化，加持很难相信这就是他带到第三东京的那个女孩，加持知道他要感谢某个年轻人。她的态度不再像以前那么粗鲁，当然也不再那么不知道她怀孕了并与她所爱的年轻人订婚了。那个害怕的小女孩还在，但她现在不害怕与人亲近了。

The only thought that darken Kaji's mood was that he was afraid he knew who the father of Asuka's baby was, but he wasn't completely sure, and he definitely didn't want to say anything just yet. To derail this train of thought, Kaji began to plan Shinji's bachelor party in his head. He smirked as he thought about how best to mourn the passing of Shinji's freedom. Cackling to himself, he turned over and went to sleep.  
唯一让加持心情阴郁的想法是，他担心自己知道明日香孩子的父亲是谁，但他并不能完全确定，而且他现在也绝对不想说什么。为了打乱这个思路，梶开始在脑子里筹划真嗣的单身派对。当他思考如何最好地哀悼真嗣失去自由时，他得意地笑了。他咯咯地笑了一声，翻身睡去。

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shinji woke up the next morning with the now familiar weight of a certain redhead laying on his arm and chest. He glanced down and smiled as she slowly stirred and woke, looking up at him with her bright blue eyes. She seemed so happy and at peace, despite the fact it was early on a Monday morning. Her smile warmed his heart as she leaned forward and gave him a good morning kiss.  
第二天早上，真嗣醒来时，他的手臂和胸口上压着一个熟悉的红发女郎的重量。他低头看了一眼，微笑着看着她慢慢地醒来，用明亮的蓝眼睛抬头看着他。尽管这是周一的清晨，她看起来还是那么快乐和平静。当她倾身给他一个早安吻时，她的微笑温暖了他的心。

"Morning, handsome," she said as she looked deep into Shinji's eyes. _"When did he get to be so good looking?"_ she thought to herself as she ran her fingers through his hair.  
“早上好，帅哥。”她深深地看着真嗣的眼睛说道。 “他什么时候长得这么好看了？”她一边想，一边用手指梳理着他的头发。

"What? Where?" Shinji teased as he looked around the room, looking for an intruder. Asuka smiled as she slugged his chest before laying back down and snuggling into him. She loved to listen to his heartbeat as she shared his warmth and his strength. For his part, Shinji was simply overjoyed that the woman of his dreams was with him.  
“什么哪里？”真嗣一边调侃一边环视房间，寻找入侵者。明日香微笑着拍拍他的胸口，然后躺回床上，依偎在他身上。她喜欢听他的心跳，分享他的温暖和力量。对于真嗣而言，他只是因为他梦中的女人和他在一起而感到欣喜若狂。

_"Guten morgen, kinder,"_ Heidi called out as she opened the door to Shinji and Asuka's room. "It's time for you to get up and eat! _Schnell,_ or you'll be late for school!"  
“Guten morgen，友善点。”海蒂一边打开真嗣和明日香的房间门，一边喊道。 “你该起床吃饭了！施奈尔，不然上学就要迟到了！”

_"Scheisse!_" Asuka screeched as she leapt up and started pulling Shinji from the bed, "Get up, idiot! You let us over sleep! Now we're going to be late!"  
“谢瑟！”明日香尖叫着跳了起来，开始把真嗣从床上拉起来，“起来吧，白痴！你让我们睡过头了！现在我们要迟到了！”

"Huh? Me?!" Shinji stammered as he slowly got up from the bed, a confused look on his face. "The alarm hasn't gone off yet!"  
“啊？我？！”真嗣结结巴巴地从床上爬起来，脸上满是困惑。 “闹钟还没响呢！”

"Asuka! Watch your language, young lady!" Heidi snapped, her hands on her hips and glaring at her niece.  
“明日香！小姑娘，注意你的语言！”海蒂厉声说道，她双手叉腰，怒视着她的侄女。

"Eep! Yes ma'am!" Asuka squeaked as she came to a dead stop before her aunt. Shinji was truly impressed, _nobody_ ever had that kind of effect on Asuka. "But… but Shinji still has to make breakfast and our lunches! We're going to be late, and I really need to talk to Hikari when I get to school!"  
“哎呀！是的，女士！”明日香尖叫一声，在姨妈面前停了下来。真嗣确实印象深刻，从来没有人对明日香有过这样的影响。 “但是……但是真嗣还得做早餐和我们的午餐！我们要迟到了，而且我到学校后真的需要和光谈谈！”

"Relax, little one! There's plenty of time! I made your breakfasts and lunches already, so you'll have plenty of time to clean up and eat! But you still need to get going!" Heidi replied as she stood aside and let Asuka run to the bathroom to start her shower. Just about that time, Shinji's alarm went off.  
“放心吧，小家伙！时间还有的是的！我已经给你做好了早餐和午餐，所以你有足够的时间去清理和吃饭！但你还得走！”海蒂一边回答，一边站在一旁，让明日香跑去浴室开始洗澡。就在这时，真嗣的闹钟响了。

"Thanks, Aunt Heidi," Shinji said as he wiped the sleep from his eyes, "you didn't have to do that. I don't mind making our lunches and such." He gave her a grateful smile. Heidi wasn't surprised that her niece had finally fallen for the young man before her.  
“谢谢，海蒂阿姨，”真嗣擦去睡意，说道，“你不必这么做。我不介意为我们做午餐之类的。”他给了她一个感激的微笑。海蒂对于她的侄女最终爱上眼前的年轻人并不感到惊讶。

"It's my pleasure, Shinji, so don't worry about it! Besides, you are probably going to need all the help and rest you can get from now on. Taking care of a pregnant wife, as well as going to school and a job is going to take it's toll." she replied as she and Shinji left his room for the kitchen. Taking his seat, Shinji smirked as Heidi placed a rather large German breakfast before him.  
“这是我的荣幸，真嗣，所以不用担心！此外，从现在开始，你可能需要所有能得到的帮助和休息。照顾怀孕的妻子，以及上学和照顾孩子。”工作将会付出代价。”当她和真嗣离开他的房间前往厨房时，她回答道。当海蒂在他面前摆上一份相当丰盛的德国早餐时，真嗣得意地笑了。

"Gee, thanks, " he said flatly, " I'm really looking forward to it." Heidi chuckled a bit as she saw the twinkle in his eye. Despite his tone, Shinji had no reservations, and Heidi could see it.  
“哎呀，谢谢，”他平淡地说，“我真的很期待。”海蒂看到他眼中闪烁的光芒，轻笑了一声。尽管语气如此，真嗣却毫无保留，海蒂也看得出来。

"Eat! We need to make you all nice and strong like a good German husband should be!" Heidi fussed as she set Asuka and Misato's places for them.  
“吃吧！我们需要让你们都变得善良、坚强，就像一个好的德国丈夫应该有的那样！”海蒂一边忙着给明日香和美里安排位置。

"Uh, Heidi?" Shinji said, as he started in on his sausage, " You know I'm Japanese, right? And Asuka and I aren't married yet?" He did his best to suppress his grin.  
“呃，海蒂？”真嗣开始吃香肠时说道，“你知道我是日本人，对吧？而且我和明日香还没有结婚？”他竭力忍住笑意。

"Feh! Details! Details!" Heidi replied as she took a seat at the table, a sly grin on her face. Shinji couldn't take it any more and burst out in laughter, joined quickly by Heidi. Asuka chose that time to make her appearance.  
“呃！详细！详细！”海蒂一边回答，一边在桌边坐下，脸上挂着狡黠的笑容。真嗣再也受不了了，放声大笑起来，海蒂也很快加入了笑声。明日香选择了这个时间登场。

"What are you two cackling about?" Asuka muttered as she sat down and tore into her breakfast. Heidi's eyes widened as she saw how bad Asuka's table manners were, and turned to Shinji. He just shrugged resignedly and shook his head. Heidi gave him a quick wink and turned back to Asuka.  
“你们两个在咯咯笑什么？”明日香一边嘟哝着，一边坐下来吃起早餐。海蒂看到明日香的餐桌礼仪如此糟糕，瞪大了眼睛，转向真嗣。他只是无奈地耸耸肩，摇了摇头。海蒂快速地对他眨了眨眼，然后转身面向明日香。

"Oh, I was just tell Shinji about how you were still wetting the bed when you were eight, and how cute it was watching you trying to hide or wash the sheets before Oma or I could walk in and discover it!" Heidi said sweetly as she watched Asuka go pale.  
“哦，我刚刚告诉真嗣，你八岁时还在尿床，在我或奥玛走进去发现它之前，看着你试图隐藏或清洗床单是多么可爱！”海蒂看着明日香脸色惨白，甜蜜地说道。

"Arrgh!! You didn't!" Asuka screamed as she slammed her hands on the table. Shinji, in his infinite wisdom, didn't say a thing, or make any signs whatsoever that he was going to laugh. He was, however, busting a gut inside. "Aunt Heidi! How could you?! That was a family secret!!"  
“啊！！你没有！”明日香双手拍在桌子上，惨叫出声。真嗣以他无限的智慧，没有说什么，也没有做出任何要笑的迹象。然而，他的内心却在崩溃。 “海蒂阿姨！你怎么可以？！那是家族秘密！！”

"I also asked your Shinji if you still drooled at night, but he never answered me," Heidi pouted as Asuka shot daggers in Shinji's direction. He shook his head violently. "Besides Asuka, Shinji's going to be a member of the family, and family shouldn't have secrets from each other." Heidi sat there, resting her chin on her hands and smiled at Asuka sweetly.  
“我还问过你的真嗣，你晚上还流口水吗，但他从来没有回答我。”海蒂撅起嘴，明日香朝真嗣的方向射出匕首。他猛烈地摇头。 “除了明日香之外，真嗣也将成为这个家庭的一员，家人之间不应该有秘密。”海蒂坐在那里，双手撑着下巴，对明日香甜甜地笑了笑。

"No secrets, huh?" Asuka replied, "How about the time you went out with you co-worker and came back home 15 minutes later because you were so excited to go out with him you forgot to put your panties on?" Asuka smirked as her aunt gasped.  
“没什么秘密吧？”明日香回答道：“有一次你和同事出去玩，15 分钟后才回家，因为你太兴奋了，忘了穿内裤？”当姨妈喘着粗气时，明日香咯咯地笑了。

"Oh really? How about all that juicy stuff you wrote in your diary about Kaji, huh? And to think you used to call Shinji a pervert!" Heidi shot back as her niece turned twenty different shades of red.  
“哦，真的吗？你在日记里写的关于加持的那些有趣的东西怎么样？想想你曾经称真嗣是个变态！”当她的侄女脸色变成二十种不同深浅的红色时，海蒂反击了。

"Don't you dare!" screeched the young German, looking nervously to Shinji, who's eyes widened a bit at that news, "How about when you came home so drunk from a party you puked in Uncle Hans' urn? If I recall, you blamed it on the dog, and everyone was trying to figure out how Fritz managed to get to the top shelf and get the lid off the urn!"  
“你不敢！” ”年轻的德国人尖叫道，紧张地看着真嗣，真嗣听到这个消息睁大了眼睛，“你参加完聚会喝醉了，吐在汉斯叔叔的瓮里，怎么样？如果我没记错的话，你把这归咎于狗，每个人都想弄清楚弗里茨是如何到达最上面的架子并打开瓮的盖子的！”

"Hey, dogs can jump!" Heidi said in her own defense, not very happy that the tables had been turned in her attempt at teasing Asuka.  
“嘿，狗会跳！”海蒂为自己辩护道，对于她试图戏弄明日香的行为发生了逆转，她不太高兴。

"Fritz was a miniature dachshund and the shelf was five feet straight up! What, did someone shoot him the butt with a tazer and make him jump that high?" Asuka shot back, crossing her arms and believing she had scored a direct hit. Heidi's eyes narrowed.  
“弗里茨是一只微型腊肠犬，架子直立五英尺！什么，有人用泰瑟枪射中他的屁股，让他跳那么高吗？”明日香回击，交叉双臂，相信自己击中了对手。海蒂的眼睛眯了起来。

"Hey, it could happen! What about the time when you were young and played with your toy boat in the…."  
“嘿，这可能会发生！你小时候在……里玩玩具船的时候怎么样？”

"Ack! No! Alright! I give! I surrender!" Asuka said as she threw her hands up in the air, "I have nothing to counter that. I mean, that's even worse than when I found all you missing underwear in your boyfriend's car that one day!" Asuka's eyes twinkled as she gave her fiancé a wink. Heidi's jaw hit the table.  
“嗯！不！好吧！我认输！我投降！”明日香举起双手说道：“我没有什么可以反驳的。我的意思是，这比那天我在你男朋友的车里发现你们全都脱了内衣更糟糕！”明日香的眼睛闪闪发光，向她的未婚夫眨了眨眼。海蒂的下巴撞到了桌子。

"When in the hell did you do that?" she stammered as Asuka sat back with a look of triumph on her face. Shinji was ready to burst, he wanted to laugh so badly that tears were trying to stream out of the corners of his eyes.  
“你到底什么时候这么做的？”她结结巴巴地说，明日香坐回座位上，脸上露出胜利的表情。真嗣快要笑出来了，他太想笑了，眼泪都快要从眼角流出来了。

"Wow, that was quite a battle," a new voice said innocently as Heidi and Asuka turned to the speaker.  
“哇，那真是一场战斗，”当海蒂和明日香转向扬声器时，一个新的声音天真地说道。

"Just where the hell did you come from, Misato?" Asuka demanded as her aunt gave her a smack on the arm.  
“美里，你到底是从哪里来的？”明日香问道，姨妈拍了拍她的手臂。

"Language," Heidi scolded as she pointed a finger at her niece.  
“语言。”海蒂用手指着侄女斥责道。

"Yes ma'am," came the quiet reply.  
“是的，女士。”安静的回答。

"Actually, I've been here ever since you two started you little Teasefest," Misato replied as she sipped her tea, " you were just too busy to notice." She smiled her little vicious smile, knowing she now had fresh ammunition to use. She noticed Shinji slowly getting up from the table, obviously in some distress. "Are you okay, Shinji?" Even Asuka and Heidi looked worried.  
“其实，自从你们两个开始你们的小茶​​会以来，我就一直在这里了，”美里一边喝着茶一边回答道，“你们只是太忙了，没有注意到。”她露出邪恶的笑容，知道她现在有了新的弹药可以使用。她注意到真嗣慢慢地从桌子上站起来，显然有些痛苦。 “你没事吧，慎二？”就连明日香和海蒂也露出了担忧的表情。

"I'm…fine…I…need…a…shower…if…you'll…excuse…me…" Shinji said slowly as he stood and walked to the bathroom. Asuka was worried that maybe her aunt's teasing about Kaji had upset Shinji, and she was going to tear her aunt a new one if it had hurt her man. She didn't have to worry for long, though.  
“我……很好……我……需要……洗个澡……如果……你能……原谅……我……”真嗣慢慢地说，站起来走向浴室。明日香担心姨妈对加持的戏弄可能会让真嗣心烦意乱，如果伤害了她的男人，她就要给姨妈撕一张新的。不过，她不必担心太久。

"Bwahahahahahahahah!" Shinji laughed hysterically behind the closed bathroom door. Asuka saw red as she stormed to the door and banged on it hard.  
“哇哈哈哈哈哈哈！”真嗣在紧闭的浴室门后歇斯底里地笑了起来。明日香脸红了，她冲到门口，用力敲门。

"Ikari! You had better stop laughing this instant or I'm going to make sure we won't have any other children!" she yelled as Heidi and Misato's eyes shot open wide at her announcement.  
“碇！你最好别再笑了，否则我会确保我们不会再有孩子了！”她喊道，海蒂和美里听到她的宣布都睁大了眼睛。

"Yes…dear!" he replied through giggles as he stepped into the shower, leaving a very angry redhead fuming just outside the door.  
“是的亲爱的！”当他走进淋浴间时，他咯咯地笑着回答，留下门外一个非常愤怒的红发女郎。

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Come on, Asuka! You aren't still angry, are you?" Shinji asked as he drove himself, Rei, and one very irritated redhead to school. Asuka stared daggers into him as he did his best to pay attention to the road and not flinch as he feared a strike would be coming soon. He was very relieved when all Asuka did was snort and cross her arms. He saw out of the corner of his eye tears forming in her eyes, and it broke his heart.  
“来吧，明日香！你还没生气吧？”真嗣一边开车送自己、丽，还有一位非常恼火的红发女郎去学校，一边问道。明日香目光锐利地盯着他，他尽力注意道路，没有因为担心袭击即将到来而退缩。当明日香只是哼了一声并交叉双臂时，他感到非常欣慰。他眼角的余光看到她的眼里泛着泪光，他的心都碎了。

"You didn't have to laugh, you jerk! You're supposed to be on my side!" she fumed as Rei leaned forward.  
“你没必要笑，你这个混蛋！你应该站在我这边！”当丽向前倾身时，她很生气。

"Did you two have a fight this morning?" Rei asked, a bit worried for her brother and her friend. "I have heard of couples breaking up just before their weddings, I do not wish that to happen to you." Her voice was pleading, which was very strange for Rei. Asuka turned to reassure her.  
“你们两个早上吵架了吗？”丽有些担心哥哥和朋友，问道。 “我听说有情侣在婚礼前分手，我不希望这种事发生在你身上。”她的声音充满恳求，这对丽来说很奇怪。明日香转身安抚她。

"Not really, Rei, jerk face here laughed at me this morning, that's all! Trust me, it's going to take a hell of a lot more than that for him to be able to escape me!" she said as she slapped Shinji's shoulder, For his part, he smiled at what Asuka had just admitted.  
“不是真的，丽，今天早上这里的混蛋笑了我，仅此而已！相信我，他需要付出比这更多的努力才能逃离我！”她一边拍着真嗣的肩膀一边说道：

"I didn't laugh at you, Asuka!" Shinji said as he pulled into the school parking lot, "I laughed at you and your aunt having a teasing contest! You should have seen the looks on both of your faces!"  
“我没有笑你，明日香！”真嗣一边把车开进学校停车场，一边说道：“我还笑你和你阿姨在开玩笑呢！你应该看看你们俩脸上的表情！”

"What was said, Shinji?" Rei requested, and to Shinji's credit, he didn't answer. Asuka was already mad enough this morning.  
“说什么了，真嗣？”丽问道，值得赞扬的是，他没有回答。明日香今天早上已经够生气的了。

"Don't you dare, Third!" Asuka growled as he parked. Already a small crowd was beginning to gather around the car.  
“老三你不敢！”明日香停车时咆哮着。一小群人已经开始聚集在汽车周围。

"Wouldn't think of it, Second!" he replied smirking. The smirk vanished as he saw the look on Asuka's face as they got out of the car. "Are you alright, Asuka?" The young German looked at him, and then back at the crowd. Rei was equally concerned and went to stand by her friend's side. Shinji was there a split second later, and took her by the hand. She was trembling, but Shinji's touch calmed her greatly. She looked at the crowd wide-eyed, then turned to look back at Shinji, and got lost once more in his kind, deep blue eyes. "Asuka?"  
“没想到啊，二哥！”他笑着回答。当他看到下车时明日香脸上的表情时，笑容消失了。 “你没事吧，明日香？”年轻的德国人看着他，然后又看向人群。丽也同样担心，走到朋友身边。下一秒真嗣就出现了，握住了她的手。她浑身发抖，但真嗣的触碰让她平静了不少。她睁大眼睛看着人群，然后回头看着真嗣，再次迷失在他慈祥、深蓝色的眼睛里。 “明日香？”

"Come here," she gasped as she pulled him by the front of his shirt and planted a deep, loving kiss on his lips. It took him by surprise but he quickly responded and kissed her back just as deeply, both lost in their own little world together. No one else existed, just the two of them as the outside world ceased to be. All too soon the spell, and the kiss, was broken as Shinji leaned back against the car, his knees weak. Asuka looked in his eyes and smiled, as her heart raced and she had to fight the weakness in her own knees.  
“过来，”她喘息着拉着他的衬衫前襟，在他的嘴唇上深深地、充满爱意地吻了一下。这让他吃了一惊，但他很快做出了反应，同样深深地回吻了她，两人一起沉浸在自己的小世界里。没有其他人存在，只有他们两个人，外面的世界已经不存在了。很快，这个咒语和这个吻就被打破了，真嗣靠在车上，膝盖发软。明日香看着他的眼睛，微笑着，她的心跳加速，她必须克服自己膝盖的虚弱。

"There!" she purred as she pulled back and took his hand, "Now everyone knows your mine!" She turned to walk to class when she discovered Shinji wasn't moving. Turning back, she was surprised when he pulled her back toward him and planted a gentle kiss on her lips, sending waves of warmth throughout her body and tingles down her spine.  
“那里！”她拉开他的手，低声说道：“现在每个人都知道你是我的了！”当她发现真嗣一动不动时，她转身步行去教室。转过身来，她惊讶地发现他将她拉向自己，并在她的唇上轻轻一吻，一股暖流传遍了她的全身，让她的脊椎发麻。

"What was that for?" she whispered breathlessly as leaned against his chest, her cheeks flushed with warmth.  
“那是干什么用的？”她靠在他的胸口，气喘吁吁地低声说道，脸颊泛着温暖的红晕。

"Because I love you," he replied, smiling warmly, "and to let everyone know you are mine, as well!" Asuka smirked and turned to face the astonished crowd, as the mask of the Red Demon slid into place.  
“因为我爱你，”他温暖地微笑着回答，“并且让每个人都知道你也是我的！”当红恶魔的面具滑入到位时，明日香微笑着转身面对惊讶的人群。

"Well? What the hell are you morons staring at?" she snarled as the crowd started to disperse. Many were red-faced, some were angry, and some just didn't care. Asuka marked the angry ones in her memory as ones to keep an eye on, most were female and were giving her dirty looks. _"Ha! I knew it! Some of those tramps were after my Shinji!"_ she thought viciously as she took Shinji's hand once more and lead him to their classroom.  
“嗯？你们这些白痴到底在看什么？”当人群开始散去时，她咆哮道。很多人都红了脸，有的生气，有的根本不在意。明日香在记忆中将那些愤怒的人标记为需要留意的人，大多数都是女性，并且用肮脏的眼神看着她。 “哈！我就知道！那些流浪汉是来追杀我的真嗣的！”她恶狠狠地想着，再次牵起真嗣的手，带他去了教室。

"Are you coming, Rei?" Shinji called back as he noticed his sister still standing by the car. He was a little surprised to see her cheeks red and that she was staring at her feet.  
“你来吗，雷？”当真嗣注意到妹妹还站在车旁时，他回了电话。他有些惊讶地看到她的脸颊红了，而且她盯着自己的脚。

"Uh, yeah, I'm coming," she replied as she rushed over to join her brother and future sister-in-law. She still looked a bit down.  
“呃，是的，我来了。”她一边回答，一边冲过去和她的哥哥和未来的嫂子会合。她的神情还是有些低落。

"What's wrong, Rei?" Shinji asked, concerned for his sister. Normal life was still so new to her, and he did worry about her, like a good brother should.  
「怎么了，雷？」真嗣关切地问道。正常的生活对她来说还是那么陌生，他也确实像一个好兄弟那样担心她。

"I…uh…just didn't want to intrude," she confessed. Rei knew that couples liked to be alone, and after watching the display of affection her two fellow pilots had just shown, she wasn't too sure if she was welcome. Rei was completely shocked when Asuka slid up next to her and gave her a quick hug.  
“我……呃……只是不想打扰，”她承认道。丽知道情侣们都喜欢独处，在看到两位飞行员同伴刚刚表现出的爱意后，她不太确定自己是否受欢迎。当明日香滑到她身边并快速拥抱她时，丽完全震惊了。

"You're not intruding, 'sis'," Asuka replied as she tried her best to make Rei more comfortable, "Trust me, I'll let you know if you are!" she teased the blue haired girl. Rei smiled, knowing there wasn't any deception on Asuka's part. She was also happy Asuka regarded her as a sister.  
“你没有打扰，‘姐姐’，”明日香回答道，她尽力让丽更舒服，“相信我，如果你打扰了，我会让你知道的！”她戏弄蓝发女孩。丽笑了，知道明日香并没有欺骗。她也很高兴明日香将她视为妹妹。

"Are you okay, Asuka? You looked really nervous when we pulled up," Rei observed as they made their way to their classroom. Hikari was there at the door to greet them all. Asuka flashed Hikari a smile as they passed by and took their seats within.  
“你还好吗，明日香？当我们停下来的时候，你看上去真的很紧张。”当他们走向教室时，丽观察到。光在门口迎接他们。当他们经过并在里面坐下时，明日香对光露出了微笑。

"I'm…fine, " Asuka replied, growing nervous once more. She felt like a million eyes were bearing down on her, like they all knew her little secret. "Just a bit worried, I guess."  
“我……很好，”明日香回答道，再次变得紧张起来。她感觉好像有一百万双眼睛注视着她，就像他们都知道她的小秘密一样。 “我想只是有点担心。”

"There's nothing to be worried about, hon," Shinji whispered in her ear as he gave her small hug from behind. Asuka immediately felt at peace. "Don't forget, you have a prenatal appointment after school. Section 2 will take you and Heidi there directly and bring you back home as soon as it's over."  
“没什么好担心的，亲爱的，”真嗣在她耳边低声说道，同时从背后轻轻地拥抱了她。明日香立刻感到安心。 “别忘了，放学后你还有产检，二组会直接带你和海蒂去那里，产检结束后马上送你回家。”

"I think that's what I'm nervous about! I'm kinda scared everyone knows what's going on," she whispered back to him as she took his hand.  
“我想这就是我紧张的地方！我有点害怕每个人都知道发生了什么事，”她握住他的手，低声回答他。

"It's none of their business, but I'm afraid they'll know soon enough,' he sympathized, then took her hand and kissed it before retreating to his own desk.  
“这不关他们的事，但我担心他们很快就会知道，”他同情地说，然后握住她的手吻了一下，然后退到自己的办公桌前。

"True," Asuka muttered as she reached down and rubbed her belly, which was beginning to swell ever so slightly. It wasn't to the point anyone else would notice, but she knew that would change soon. She smiled at the thought of her and Shinji's baby.  
“是的，”明日香低声说道，她伸手揉了揉自己已经开始微微隆起的腹部。这还没有到其他人会注意到的程度，但她知道这种情况很快就会改变。想到她和真嗣的孩子，她笑了。

Lunchtime finally arrived as Asuka dragged Rei and Hikari up to their lunch spot by the tree. Hikari was at a loss as for why Asuka was in such a hurry, but it seemed really urgent. Asuka had left her several cryptic messages on her laptop during class which had really peaked her interest, especially when she had said Shinji and the other guys weren't invited. Breathlessly, Hikari, Asuka , and Rei fell in a heap by the base of their tree.  
午餐时间终于到了，明日香拖着丽和光来到树边的午餐地点。光不明白明日香为什么这么着急，但看起来确实很紧急。明日香在课堂上在笔记本电脑上给她留下了几条神秘的信息，这确实激发了她的兴趣，尤其是当她说真嗣和其他人没有被邀请时。光、明日香和丽气喘吁吁地倒在树下。

"Asuka, what in Heaven's name was so important that we had to rush up here?" Hikari demanded. "Is everything alright with you and Shinji? I see you didn't want the Stooges here with us this time." Rei and Asuka exchange small smiles and knowing looks before breaking up into small giggles. Hikari was looking a bit annoyed at this.  
“明日香，到底是什么事情如此重要，以至于我们不得不赶到这里？”光问道。 “你和真嗣还好吗？我看你这次不想让傀儡们和我们在一起了。”丽和明日香交换了微笑和会意的眼神，然后咯咯地笑了起来。看到这里，希卡里显得有些恼怒。

"Everything's okay with me and Shinji, the baby too! I just didn't want all that testosterone stinking things up around here right now!" Asuka replied as she started to unpack the lunch Heidi had made. She and Rei's mouths started to water almost immediately. "I was just wondering if you noticed anything different about me today?"  
“我和真嗣一切都好，还有孩子！我只是不想现在这里到处都是睾丸激素带来的恶臭！”明日香一边回答，一边开始打开海蒂做的午餐。她和雷几乎立刻就流口水了。 “我只是想知道你今天有没有发现我有什么不同？”

"Huh?" Hikari said as she looked at her friend strangely. She looked closely at Asuka. Her hairstyle was still the same, her uniform was no different than before, her baby belly wasn't showing, her shoes were still the same, and she didn't change up her makeup in any way. Hikari was at a loss until she saw a glint coming from a finger on Asuka's left hand. Her jaw hit the ground as words tried to form but refused to cooperate. Finally, her brain slipped into gear. "Ohmigawd! Is that what I think it is?"  
“嗯？”光奇怪地看着自己的朋友说道。她仔细地看着明日香。发型还是一样，制服和以前没有什么不同，肚子没有露出来，鞋子还是一样，妆容也没有任何改变。光不知所措，直到她看到明日香左手的一根手指发出光芒。当她试图开口说话时，她的下巴撞到了地上，但拒绝配合。终于，她的大脑开始运转起来。 “天哪！是我想的那样吗？”

"Yep!" Asuka said as she smiled at the friend's reaction. "In two weeks, I'll officially be Mrs. Ikari!" Asuka never got tired of saying that out loud, she just loved the sound of it.  
“是的！”看到朋友的反应，明日香微笑着说道。 “两周后，我就正式成为碇夫人了！”明日香从来不厌倦大声说出这句话，她只是喜欢它的声音。

"When…when did he ask? Did you know he was going to ask you?" Hikari stammered, still in total shock over her friends' actions. Was this the same fiery redhead she met back in junior high? Was Shinji still the same painfully shy boy she had known for just as long? The changes were overwhelming.  
“他……什么时候问的？你知道他要问你吗？”光结结巴巴，仍然对朋友们的行为感到震惊。这还是她初中时遇到的火红头发吗？真嗣还是那个她认识已久的害羞男孩吗？变化是巨大的。

"He asked me Friday night, after he took me out on an official date, if you can believe that!" Asuka beamed as she showed the ring off to her best friend. "You wouldn't believe what the idiot did to get up enough cash to buy this, though."  
“周五晚上，在他带我出去正式约会后，他问我，你是否相信这一点！”明日香微笑着向她最好的朋友展示戒指。 “不过，你不会相信这个白痴为了筹集足够的现金来买这个而做了什么。”

"He sold his bike," Hikari replied as he opinion of the young man rose even higher than before. Asuka just looked at her in shock. "Touji told me about Shinji selling his bike Friday evening after he came back from NERV headquarters."  
“他卖掉了自行车。”光回答道，他对这个年轻人的评价比以前更高了。明日香只是震惊地看着她。 “Touji 告诉我，Shinji 星期五晚上从 NERV 总部回来后卖掉了他的自行车。”

"Did you know he sold his cello, as well?" Asuka added, still a bit peeved at her fiancé. Rei and Hikari's jaws both hit the ground this time.  
“你知道他也卖掉了大提琴吗？”明日香补充道，仍然对她的未婚夫有点恼火。这次丽和光的下巴都掉到了地上。

"He did what?!" Rei screamed as she started looking around for her brother. Asuka had a feeling that Rei wanted to do more than just give him a piece of her mind.  
“他做了什么？！”丽尖叫着开始四处寻找她的兄弟。明日香有一种感觉，丽想要做的不仅仅是向他表达自己的想法。

"Calm down, Rei! I already let him have it over that one!" Asuka reassured her as she turned back to Hikari, "So! What time can you come over tonight?"  
「冷静点，丽！我已经让他受够了！」明日香一边向她保证，一边转向光，“那么！你今晚什么时候可以过来？”

"Anytime after dinner, why?" Hikari asked, wondering what her friend was up to.  
“晚饭后任何时候，为什么？”光问道，想知道她的朋友在做什么。

"Well, we need to get your measurements, then get over to the Mall as soon as we can," Asuka replied. Hikari looked at her in confusion.  
“好吧，我们需要测量一下你的尺寸，然后尽快赶到购物中心，”明日香回答道。光一脸困惑地看着她。

"Why do you need my measurements?" she wondered as Rei's and Asuka's eyes twinkled. Hikari wasn't sure what the two EVA pilots had up their sleeves.  
“为什么需要我的测量数据？”她疑惑地看着丽和明日香的眼睛闪烁着。光不确定这两名 EVA 飞行员到底有什么秘密。

"Why? For your bridesmaid dress, of course!" Asuka answered her, before becoming serious just a second later, "You do want to be one of my bridesmaids, don't you?"  
“为什么？当然是为了你的伴娘服！”明日香回答道，过了一会儿就严肃起来，“你确实想成为我的伴娘之一，不是吗？”

"What?" Hikari exclaimed, shocked beyond belief, " Yes! Of course! I'll be honored! Thank you Asuka!" Once more, there was squealing, hugging, and tears as the three young ladies held on to one another and jumped around for joy.  
“什么？”光惊讶得难以置信，“是的！当然！我会很荣幸！谢谢明日香！”三位年轻女士再次拥抱在一起，高兴地跳来跳去，尖叫声、拥抱声和泪水再次响起。

"Huh. Wonder what that is all about?" Touji asked as he, Shinji, and Kensuke watched the three ladies jumping up and down by their normal lunch tree. Shinji smiled knowingly, as he knew what Asuka had just asked Hikari, and received a positive answer. Now, it was his turn. He had managed to talk his two friends into taking lunch on the roof, and was waiting for a signal to begin, He had just received that signal from his fiancée.  
“哈。想知道这是怎么回事吗？”东治、真嗣和健介看着三位女士在平常的午餐树旁跳来跳去，问道。真嗣会意地笑了笑，因为他知道明日香刚才问光的问题，并得到了肯定的回答。现在，轮到他了。他设法说服他的两个朋友在屋顶上吃午饭，并正在等待开始的信号，他刚刚收到了未婚妻的信号。

"Smoke signals?" Kensuke asked. He liked playing this game with Shinji.  
“烟火信号？”健介问道。他喜欢和真嗣一起玩这个游戏。

"No."

"Telegraph?" “电报？”

"Nope." “没有。”

"Semaphore?" “信号？”

"Not on your life, like anyone could read that these days, anyway!" Shinji replied with a grin, turning and looking at his friends. Kensuke had been trying to think of a way that Shinji would let him let everyone know about Asuka. It was all in good fun, Kensuke had no intentions of revealing the secret.  
“无论如何，这不会影响你的生活，就像现在任何人都可以读到的那样！”真嗣笑着回答，转身看着他的朋友们。剑介一直在想办法让真嗣让他让所有人都知道明日香的事。一切都是为了好玩，健介并没有打算泄露这个秘密。

"Sign language?" Kensuke added. Touji looked at him, becoming rather annoyed at his friend's chatter.  
“标志语言？”健介补充道。东二看着他，对朋友的喋喋不休感到相当恼火。

"I'll give you a sign in a minute if you don't shut up!" Touji growled as Shinji sat down and started laughing. His two friends joined him as he opened the lunch Heidi packed. Touji's eyes immediately lit up.  
“你再不闭嘴我一会儿就给你一个信号！”当真嗣坐下并开始大笑时，东治咆哮道。当他打开海蒂打包的午餐时，他的两个朋友加入了他。东二的眼睛顿时亮了起来。

"Dude! You didn't tell me Heidi was back!" Touji exclaimed as Shinji started doling out the lunch to his two best buddies.  
“伙计！你没告诉我海蒂回来了！”当真嗣开始给他两个最好的朋友分发午餐时，东治惊呼道。

"How do you know Heidi's back?" Kensuke asked as Touji dove into the food Shinji provided.  
“你怎么知道海蒂回来了？”当东司一头扎进真嗣提供的食物时，健介问道。

"No one cooks like Heidi! Man, she's the best! Uh, no offense, Shinji," Touji added as he sang the praises of Asuka's aunt. Shinji chuckled.  
“没有人像海蒂那样做饭！天哪，她是最棒的！呃，无意冒犯，真嗣，”东次一边称赞明日香的阿姨一边补充道。慎二笑道。

"No problem," he replied. He knew Touji was expert at eating, and telling who made what meals. It's what saved him several times when other's couldn't tell Misato's cooking from anyone else's from sight alone. It saved him many a stomachache. "Yeah, Heidi came in yesterday from Germany. She wanted to make sure Asuka was doing alright."  
“没问题，”他回答道。他知道东司很擅长吃东西，并且知道谁做了什么饭菜。当其他人无法仅凭视觉区分美里的烹饪和其他人的烹饪时，这多次拯救了他。这让他免去了很多胃痛。 “是的，海蒂昨天从德国回来了。她想确保明日香一切都好。”

"So, how is the De…Asuka doing?" Kensuke asked, catching himself before he could say the wrong thing and end up on the receiving end of an Ikari knuckle sandwich.  
“那么，德……明日香怎么样了？”健介问道，他在说错话并最终成为碇指节三明治的接受者之前控制住了自己。

"She's doing good, thanks," Shinji replied, "She has a doctor's appointment today after school to see how she and the baby are doing. Heidi's going with her to watch out for her. I'm going to be stuck at NERV today, something about 'learning things that every man should know', at least that's what Misato said," His friends could tell that he wished he could go with Asuka.  
“她很好，谢谢。”真嗣回答道，“她今天放学后约了医生，看看她和孩子的情况如何。海蒂会和她一起去照顾她。我今天要被困在 NERV 了。” ，关于‘学习每个人都应该知道的事情’，至少美里是这么说的。”他的朋友们看得出来，他希望能和明日香一起去。

"Misato could teach me a thing or two," Touji replied as he stuffed part of an egg roll in his mouth. Kensuke chuckled evilly.  
“美里可以教我一两件事。”东次边回答边把蛋卷塞进嘴里。健介邪恶地笑道。

"Better not let Hikari hear you say that," Shinji said, causing Touji to choke on the egg roll. He gave Shinji a dirty look.  
“最好不要让光听到你这么说。”真嗣说道，结果东次被蛋卷噎住了。他恶狠狠地看了真嗣一眼。

"Dude, you wouldn't!" Touji begged as Shinji crossed his arms and stared at him. "After all, I'm a fellow pilot, right?" Shinji's smile was predatory, like a lion eyeing a tasty antelope.  
“哥们，你不会的！”东次哀求道，真嗣交叉双臂，凝视着他。 “毕竟，我是一名飞行员，对吧？”真嗣的笑容充满了掠夺性，就像狮子盯着美味的羚羊一样。

"Well, that depends on what you do and say the next few minutes," Shinji replied as he got his courage up to tell his friends what was going on. "You asked me Friday why I sold my bike, but I never told you why, right?"  
“好吧，这取决于你在接下来的几分钟里做什么和说什么，”真嗣回答道，他鼓起勇气告诉他的朋友们发生了什么事。 “你周五问我为什么卖掉自行车，但我从来没有告诉过你为什么，对吧？”

"Yeah, Touji told me about that! What gives, man? That bike was the coolest!" Kensuke said as he looked at his friend in shock.  
“是的，Touji 告诉我了！​​这有什么用，伙计？那辆自行车是最酷的！”健介惊讶地看着自己的朋友说道。

"Yeah, that was the best thing Asuka ever did, convincing you to by that thing!" Touji added as the shock hit him once more. The only decent thing the Demon ever did, and Shinji gets rid of it!  
“是的，这是明日香做过的最好的事情，用那件事说服了你！”东治再次感到震惊，补充道。恶魔做过的唯一正经的事，真嗣却摆脱了它！

"I had a good reason, guys, trust me!" Shinji said as he readied himself. "I needed the cash to by Asuka a ring."  
“我有充分的理由，伙计们，相信我！”真嗣一边做好准备一边说道。 “我需要现金给明日香买一枚戒指。”

"A ring?!" both his friends asked in stereo. The looks on their faces were priceless.  
“戒指？！”他的两个朋友用立体声问道。他们脸上的表情是无价的。

"Yes, a ring. I asked her to marry me Friday night, and she agreed!" Shinji answered, his head held high, like he dared his friends to say anything negative. It was a dare they answered.  
“是的，一枚戒指。周五晚上我向她求婚，她同意了！”真嗣回答道，他昂着头，就像他敢于让他的朋友们说出任何负面的话。他们的回答是大胆的。

"Dude! How could you!" Touji screamed, his face white with shock.  
“老兄！你怎么可以！”东二惊呼一声，脸色惨白。

"You've betrayed us!" Kensuke added. "Marriage! Man, that's horrible!"  
“你背叛了我们！”健介补充道。 “婚姻！伙计，这太可怕了！”

"Yeah, a blow to manhood heard throughout the World!" Touji said. Shinji gritted his teeth.  
“是啊，全世界都听到了对男子气概的打击！”东二说道。真嗣咬牙切齿。

"Beside, you two are too young, right? You're both just sixteen, right? It's against the law!" Kensuke topped off, like he had just won a debate. He was dead wrong.  
“而且，你们两个也太小了吧？才十六岁吧？这是犯法的！”健介表现出色，就像他刚刚赢得了一场辩论一样。他大错特错了。

"First off, I love Asuka, that will never change!" Shinji growled. "I want her and the baby both in my life, now and forever. Second, we are both military personnel, and as such, we both follow a different set of rules and laws than civilians. Third, Asuka is an emancipated minor, which gives her all the rights guaranteed to adults. Fourth, this will make Asuka happy, and it will make me happy, which should make YOU TWO happy!" He stopped and unclenched his fists. He had hoped they wouldn't act this way. The two of them looked shamed by Shinji's words. They had both known how he had felt about Asuka for a long time now, and this was the logical extension of those feelings after what had happened to Asuka.  
“首先，我爱明日香，这一点永远不会改变！”真嗣咆哮道。 “我希望她和孩子都在我的生活中，无论是现在还是永远。其次，我们都是军人，因此，我们都遵循与平民不同的规则和法律。第三，明日香是一个获得解放的未成年人，第四，这会让明日香开心，也会让我开心，这会让你们两个开心！”他停下来，松开了拳头。他原本希望他们不要这么做。真嗣的话让两人都露出了羞愧的表情。他们很早就知道他对明日香的感觉，而这是在明日香发生的事情之后这些感觉的逻辑延伸。

"Yo, Shin-man, I'm sorry. I'm happy for you man, honest," Touji said, feeling ashamed and deflated. He and Kensuke didn't stop to think about Shinji's feelings.  
“哟，Shin-man，我很抱歉。老实说，我为你感到高兴，”Touji 说道，感到羞愧和泄气。他和剑介没有停下来思考真嗣的感受。

"Yeah, me too," Kensuke added softly. "To tell the truth, I'm kinda jealous. I mean, hell, you got the hottest girl in school in love with you, and she agreed to get stuck with your sorry ass!" he said with a smile. Shinji couldn't help but to smile back.  
“是啊，我也是。”健介轻声补充道。 “说实话，我有点嫉妒。我的意思是，见鬼，你让学校里最性感的女孩爱上了你，而她却同意和你这个可怜的混蛋在一起！”他微笑着说道。真嗣忍不住回以微笑。

"Good! Now I have a favor to ask. I need you both to be my groomsmen." Touji and Kensuke were thunderstruck, they had never expected this, especially after what they had just said.  
“好！现在我有一件事情想请你们帮忙，我需要你们来做我的伴郎。”东次和剑介都惊呆了，他们万万没想到会是这样，尤其是在他们刚刚说了那句话之后。

"Whoa. Man, I'd be honored," Touji said, not believing his friend had just asked him that.  
“哇哦。伙计，我会很荣幸，”东治说道，他不相信他的朋友刚刚问了他这个问题。

"Yeah, me too," Kensuke added. Shinji could swear he saw a tear in Kensuke's eye.  
“是的，我也是，”健介补充道。真嗣可以发誓他看到了健介眼中的泪水。

"Great! Well then, after school tomorrow, the four of us are going to the Mall and getting our tuxedoes." Shinji said as he and his friends finished up their lunches and started cleaning up.  
“太好了！那么，明天放学后，我们四个人就去商场买燕尾服。”真嗣一边说着，一边和朋友们吃完午饭，开始打扫卫生。

"Tuxes? Wonderful, I always wanted to look like Pen-Pen!!" Touji mumbled as he put his garbage in the trash can. Shinji slugged his arm.  
“燕尾服？太棒了，我一直想看起来像彭彭！！”东治一边嘟囔着，一边把垃圾扔进了垃圾桶。真嗣猛地一击他的手臂。

"Four of us? Who else is coming?" Kensuke asked as he followed his friends off the roof.  
“我们四个人？还有谁来？”健介一边跟着朋友们下了屋顶，一边问道。

"Kaji's coming, too. I asked him to be my best man, guys. No offense, but he is the one who brought Asuka into my life, so it was only logical." Shinji answered as he clasped his two friends on the shoulder.  
“加持也来了。我请他做我的伴郎，伙计们。无意冒犯，但他是把明日香带入我生活的人，所以这是合乎逻辑的。”真嗣一边回答，一边抓住两个朋友的肩膀。

"So now we know who to blame!" Touji said, mock-seriously as he cracked the knuckle of his good hand with the metal one. Shinji chuckled.  
“所以现在我们知道该怪谁了！”东治一边用金属的那只手敲响了自己完好的手的指关节，一边开玩笑地说道。慎二笑道。

"Be nice, or he won't let you come to the bachelor party!" Shinji warned, as he inwardly cringed at what Kaji had planned. It couldn't be good.  
“乖一点，不然他不会让你来参加单身派对的！”真嗣警告道，他内心对加持的计划感到畏缩。这不可能是好事。

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Are you ready, Shinji?" Misato whispered softly in his ear, making Shinji's already jangled nerves even worse.  
“你准备好了吗，慎二？”美里在他耳边轻声呢喃，让真嗣本就紧张的神经更加紧张。

"Uh, yeah, I guess so, Misato," he stammered in response. It had been a long time since he had been this nervous around his guardian. He wasn't sure if he was ready for what they were about to do. "Are…are you sure we should be doing this?"  
“呃，是的，我想是的，美里，”他结结巴巴地回答道。他已经很久没有在自己的守护者身边如此紧张了。他不确定自己是否准备好接受他们即将要做的事情。 “你……你确定我们应该这样做吗？”

"Trust me, Shinji, this is something every man should learn," she replied breathlessly. "Since you're a beginner, it's better to hold it with both hands. You can get fancy later."  
“相信我，真嗣，这是每个男人都应该学习的东西，”她气喘吁吁地回答。 “既然是初学者，最好双手握着，以后再慢慢喜欢。”

"Like...like this?" he asked, as she nodded her approval. He was sweating bullets.  
“就像……这样？”他问道，她点头表示同意。他浑身冒汗。

"Yes, that's it. Now make sure to line it up, just like I showed you. Trust me, that is very important!" she replied as she wrapped her arms around him to assist. "Ooo, that's good! Now, remember what I told you what to do with your finger?"  
“是的，就是这样。现在一定要把它排好，就像我向你展示的那样。相信我，这非常重要！”她一边回答，一边用双臂搂住他以提供帮助。 “噢，那很好！现在，还记得我告诉过你如何用手指做事吗？”

"Y…y…yeah?" he replied hesitantly. He was really nervous now, there was no turning back.  
“是……是……是吗？”他犹豫地回答道。他现在真的很紧张，已经没有回头路了。

"Put your finger right where I showed you, and gently caress it. When your ready, just give it a gentle squeeze. I guarantee you'll hit your mark!" she instructed as she braced both herself and Shinji.  
“将你的手指放在我向你展示的地方，轻轻地抚摸它。准备好后，轻轻挤压它。我保证你会达到目标！”她边说边做好自己和真嗣的准备。

"If…if your sure. Here goes nothing…" he sighed as he readied himself.  
“如果……如果你确定的话。这里什么也没有……”他在做好准备时叹了口气。

_**BLAM!!! 哎呀！！！**_

"Wow! Great shot, Shinji!" Misato said as she looked at the monitor to see where Shinji had placed the bullet. "You're just a few hairs off of the ten ring. Not bad for someone who never fired a gun before in his life." She ruffled his hair as he blushed from the praise.  
“哇！射得好，真嗣！”美里边说边看着监视器，想看看真嗣把子弹放在了哪里。 “你距离十环只有几根毫毛了。对于一个从来没有开过枪的人来说，这已经很不错了。”她揉乱了他的头发，他因赞美而脸红了。

"Thanks, Misato!" he replied. Despite the fact he could shoot the wings off a fly with his EVA and a pallet rifle, this firearm in his hand felt very foreign. It was a completely different experience. "You're a great teacher!"  
“谢谢你，美里！”他回答。尽管他可以用EVA和托盘步枪打掉苍蝇的翅膀，但他手里的这把枪却感觉很陌生。这是一次完全不同的经历。 “你是一位很棒的老师！”

"Thank you, Shinji! It's nice to know I'm good at something!" she said with a wink before she turned pale and put a hand to her forehead. Stumbling backward, she almost fell over the chairs that lined the wall behind them. Shinji placed his handgun on the counter and rushed to her side.  
“谢谢你，真嗣！很高兴知道我擅长某件事！”她眨了眨眼说道，然后脸色变得苍白，一只手捂住了额头。她踉踉跄跄地向后退去，差点摔倒在身后靠墙排列的椅子上。真嗣把手枪放在柜台上，冲到她身边。

"Misato! Are you alright?" the young man asked as he grabbed her by the arm and lead her to the nearest chair and had her sit down. Shinji was getting worried, this wasn't the first time he had seen Misato grow sick in an instant before his eyes.  
“美里！你没事吧？”年轻人问道，​​抓住她的手臂，将她带到最近的一张椅子上，让她坐下。真嗣开始担心了，这已经不是他第一次看到美里在自己眼前瞬间病倒了。

"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine," she replied dismissively, "Just a little tired. Too much work and not enough Kaj...er…play!" She giggled at Shinji's bemused smirk.  
“是啊，是啊，我很好，”她轻蔑地回答，“只是有点累。工作太多，卡吉……呃……玩得不够！”看着真嗣困惑的笑容，她咯咯地笑了起来。

"Sure, Misato. I think, as your second-in-command, you should go see a doctor," he said as he placed his hands on his hips. Misato was shocked at the figure Shinji cut in his new uniform. She and Commander Fuyutsuki had decided that the EVA pilots should wear a uniform that would show their status as combat pilots, as well as being easy to remove so they could quickly change into their plug suits.  
“当然，美里。我认为，作为你的副官，你应该去看医生。”他双手叉腰说道。美里对真嗣穿着新制服的身材感到震惊。她和冬月指挥官决定，EVA 飞行员应该穿着能够显示他们战斗飞行员身份的制服，并且易于脱下，以便他们可以快速换上他们的插头服。

The uniform consisted of a one piece jumpsuit, just like the ones the armor crews and flight crews wore, only with a more generous cut so they could wear their plug suits underneath if need be. A shoulder holster with quick disconnect straps, a combat knife, and issue boots completed the outfit. To set the EVA pilots apart from everyone else, their flight suits were black in color, rather than the tan of the armor crews or the olive drab of the flight crews.  
这套制服由一件连身裤组成，就像装甲人员和飞行人员穿的一样，只是剪裁更宽松，这样他们就可以在需要时在里面穿内裤。带有快速拆卸肩带的肩套、一把战斗刀和发行的靴子完成了这套装备。为了使长荣航空飞行员与其他人区分开来，他们的飞行服是黑色的，而不是装甲人员的棕褐色或飞行人员的橄榄褐色。

"And I think Captain Ikari, as your commanding officer, you should pick up your personal weapon and continue your target practice. You have another forty-nine rounds to go, afterwards, I will show you how to strip and clean the HK USP. Remember, you must carry that with you at all times! You never know when you or your loved ones' lives may depend on it!" She said with a wink as she shooed him back to the booth.  
“而且我认为碇队长，作为你的指挥官，你应该拿起你的个人武器，继续你的打靶练习。你还有四十九发子弹，之后，我将向你展示如何剥离和清理HK USP。请记住，您必须始终随身携带它！您永远不知道什么时候您或您所爱的人的生命可能取决于它！”她眨了眨眼睛说道，然后将他赶回了摊位。

"Will you at least talk to Doctor Akagi when we're done here?" Shinji begged as he picked his weapon back up and looked at it with a new found respect. He waited to fire until he got an answer.  
“我们结束后你至少能和赤城医生谈谈吗？”真嗣一边哀求着，一边重新拿起武器，用一种新的敬意看着它。他等待着得到答复才开枪。

"Okay, you win, Shinji," Misato replied, "Now start shooting, Captain!"  
“好吧，你赢了，真嗣，”美里回答道，“现在开始射击，队长！”

"Yes ma'am," he replied as he turned to his target and proceeded to drill it mercilessly, imaging it was what had hurt his beloved. It never stood a chance.  
“是的，女士，”他回答道，然后转向他的目标，开始无情地钻探它，想象这就是伤害他心爱之人的原因。它从来没有机会。

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"We're home!" Misato and Shinji called out together as Shinji set his bag on the floor just inside the door. He was promptly pounced by a flying redhead who proceeded to try to master the patented Misato-sized hug. Shinji quickly wrapped his arms around Asuka and did his best to respond in kind. Afterward, she pulled back and looked at his clothing rather quizzically.  
“我们到家了！”当真嗣把他的包放在门内的地板上时，美里和真嗣一起喊道。他很快就被一个飞翔的红发女郎扑了上来，后者试图掌握获得专利的美里​​大小的拥抱。真嗣迅速用双臂抱住明日香，并尽最大努力做出回应。随后，她退了回来，有些疑惑地看着他的衣服。

"Hey, Maverick! Whatcha do with Shinji?" Heidi called from the kitchen as she warmed their dinner up in the microwave. The visit with Doctor Akagi took far longer than either one of them thought it would.  
“嘿，Maverick！真嗣怎么办？”当海蒂用微波炉加热晚餐时，她从厨房打来电话。拜访赤城医生的时间比他们想象的要长得多。

"I left him with Iceman back at NERV," he replied, quickly catching Heidi's reference to one of her favorite movies. They watched it many times the last time she visited, and he feared they would have to watch it many more times before she goes back to Germany.  
“我把他留在了 NERV 的 Iceman 那里，”他回答道，很快就听出了海蒂提到的她最喜欢的电影之一。上次她来的时候他们看了很多遍，他担心在她回德国之前他们还得看很多遍。

"You look good," Asuka said, "but really, what's with the uniform?" Shinji looked a little embarrassed, and then fearful, at what he was about to say.  
“你看起来不错，”明日香说，“但说实话，这身制服是怎么回事？”真嗣对他要说的话显得有些尴尬，然后又感到害怕。

"Uh, it's the new standard issue uniform for all EVA pilots," he replied , "at least you won't have to wear yours until you come back to the active roster. They issued all of us a personal weapon, as well."  
“呃，这是所有长荣飞行员的新标准制服，”他回答道，“至少在你回到现役名单之前你不必穿你的制服。他们还给我们所有人发了一件个人武器。 ”

"Eew, I'm going to have to wear one of those?" Asuka complained as she looked at what Shinji was wearing. _It looks good on him,_ she thought to herself. "Well, I just hope mine's red." She still eyed Shinji's bag.  
“呃，我必须穿其中一件吗？”明日香看着真嗣的穿着，抱怨道。他穿起来很好看，她心里想。 “好吧，我只希望我的是红色的。”她仍然盯着真嗣的包。

"Nope! Sorry, Asuka!" Misato replied as she sat down to a cup of tea, "It's black only for EVA pilots!" Asuka crossed her arms and snorted in response.  
「不！对不起，明日香！」美里一边坐下来喝茶，一边回答道：“黑色是EVA飞行员专用的！”明日香交叉双臂，哼了一声作为回应。

"But I hate black!" she whined as she snuggled up to Shinji and whispered in his ear. He nodded his head and followed her into their room and closed the door. Shinji was immediately attacked by the fiery young German. It took several minutes before either one of them decided it was time to come up for air.  
“但我讨厌黑色！”她依偎着真嗣，在他耳边低语。他点点头，跟着她进了房间，关上了门。真嗣立即遭到了这位火热的德国年轻人的攻击。过了几分钟，他们中的任何一个才决定是时候浮出水面呼吸空气了。

"I missed you," she sighed as she snuggled into his chest, enjoying the smell of his cologne. She realized it was the one she gave him last Christmas. _I was right, it does smell good on him,_ she thought to herself.  
“我想你。”她依偎在他的怀里，享受着他古龙水的味道，叹息道。她意识到这是她去年圣诞节送给他的。我是对的，他身上的味道确实不错，她心想。

"I missed you, too," Shinji replied as he finally broke from their embrace and set his bag on the bed and opened it. He pulled the most important item from it first and handed it to Asuka. "How are you and our little one doing?"  
“我也想你。”真嗣回答道，他终于挣脱了他们的拥抱，将包放在床上，打开了它。他先从里面取出了最重要的东西，递给了明日香。 “你和我们的小家伙怎么样了？”

"Thank you, thank you, thank you!" she squealed as she opened the box of German chocolates he had specially ordered for her. She quickly popped one in her mouth and one in his mouth. Shinji stood there and enjoyed the flavor as the candy melted on his tongue. "The doctor said we're both doing fine, but he's a little concerned. It seems that I haven't gained enough weight for him, but these should help! What else do you have?"  
“谢谢你，谢谢你，谢谢你！”当她打开他特意为她订购的德国巧克力盒时，她尖叫起来。她迅速将一根塞进自己嘴里，又塞一根塞进他嘴里。真嗣站在那里，享受着糖果在舌尖融化的味道。 “医生说我们都很好，但他有点担心。看来我的体重对他来说还不够，但这些应该会有帮助！你还有什么？”

"Uh, I have these," Shinji replied as he removed his and Asuka's personal weapons from the bag and set them aside. "We are to be armed from now on, orders of the Commander."  
“呃，我有这些。”真嗣一边回答，一边从包里取出他和明日香的私人武器，放在一边。 “遵照指挥官的命令，从现在开始我们必须武装起来。”

"Even at school?" “还在学校吗？”

"Even at school," Shinji sighed. It was just one more responsibility he had to deal with, one he didn't want. "And after talking to Doctor Akagi…"  
“即使是在学校，”真嗣叹了口气。这只是他必须承担的又一项责任，也是他不想要的。 “和赤城医生交谈后……”

"Bitch!" Asuka seethed. Shinji nodded but continued on.  
“贱人！”明日香沸腾了。真嗣点点头，但还是继续说道。

"After talking to the Bitch, I went and picked this up in case of an emergency." he said as he sat Asuka down and had a long talk with her. When he was done, Asuka was wide eyed, but understood the need of the object Shinji held in his hand and then quickly hid in their closet.  
“和那个贱人谈完之后，我就去把这个捡起来，以备不时之需。”他一边说，一边让明日香坐下来，与她进行了一次长谈。说完后，明日香睁大了眼睛，但明白了真嗣手里的东西的用途，然后迅速躲进了衣柜里。

"So, what did you ladies do when Misato and I were having fun at NERV?" Shinji asked as he unzipped his flight suit and began to undress. He had it halfway off when he saw Asuka's cheeks turn red and her jaw drop. It was then that he realized what he had done and quickly pulled the suit back on. His blush quickly matched that of Asuka's as he mumbled an apology.  
「那么，当我和美里在 NERV 玩的时候，你们都在做什么呢？」真嗣一边问道，一边拉开飞行服的拉链，开始脱衣服。话刚说完，他就看到明日香的脸颊变红，下巴都掉了下来。这时他才意识到自己做了什么，赶紧把衣服重新穿上。他的脸很快就和明日香一样红了，他咕哝着道歉。

"I'm sorry, Asuka, I...I didn't mean to…" he stammered before she slid over and wrapped her arms around him. He could feel the heat in her cheeks as she hugged him tight.  
“对不起，明日香，我……我不是故意的……”他结结巴巴地说，然后她滑过去，用双臂搂住了他。当她紧紧地拥抱着他时，他能感觉到她脸颊上的灼热。

"No, that's okay, just a shock, I guess," she replied shyly. "You would think that after spending our nights together for a while now, that wouldn't embarrass us. We are engaged, you know!" she continued, that last part mainly for her own benefit. Shinji nodded. "I've seen you in less!"  
“不，没关系，我想只是震惊，”她害羞地回答道。 “你可能会认为，在我们一起度过了一段时间之后，这不会让我们感到尴尬。我们订婚了，你知道！”她继续说道，最后一部分主要是为了她自己的利益。慎二点点头。 “我见你的次数少了！”

"I know, but we've never actually _undressed_ in front of each other before," Shinji added, still embarrassed. "I guess we're being silly," he said as he gathered his civilian clothing and started to walk to the bathroom. Asuka put a hand on his arm, preventing him from leaving. "Asuka?"  
“我知道，但我们以前从来没有在彼此面前脱过衣服，”真嗣补充道，仍然很尴尬。 “我想我们太傻了，”他一边说，一边收拾起自己的便服，开始走向卫生间。明日香一手搭在他的手臂上，阻止他离开。 “明日香？”

"No, stay," she said in a small voice, "this is your room too. It's just something we're going to have to get used to, I guess. Not that I mind, but…uh...that didn't come out right…" she stammered as Shinji's jaw dropped.  
“不，留下来，”她小声说道，“这也是你的房间。我想，这只是我们必须习惯的事情。我不介意，但是……呃……那并没有不太对劲……”她结结巴巴地说，真嗣的下巴都快掉下来了。

"Sheesh, I know it's serious when Asuka Langley Soryu is at a loss for words!" Shinji chuckled as his lady stood back and crossed her arms, a smirk on her face.  
“哎呀，当飞鸟·兰利·苍龙失语时，我就知道事情很严重了！”真嗣咯咯地笑起来，他的女士退后一步，交叉双臂，脸上挂着得意的笑容。

"Soon to be Asuka Langley Ikari, thank you very much! Just for that, strip! I wanna see what I'm getting myself into!" she commanded as she stood there and tapped her foot. Shinji raised one eyebrow and crossed his arms, before uncrossing them and making little circle motions with a finger.  
“很快就会成为明日香·兰利·碇，非常感谢你！就为了这个，脱衣！我想看看我自己会变成什么样子！”她站在那里，用脚轻敲着，命令道。真嗣扬起一边眉毛，交叉双臂，然后松开双臂，用一根手指做了个小圆圈动作。

"Nope, turn around first!" he said playfully as he took his pose once more, Several seconds passed before Asuka huffed, uncrossed her own arms, and turned on her heels. Shinji grinned like a wolf.  
“不行，你先转身吧！”过了好几秒，明日香才气喘吁吁地松开交叉的双臂，转过身去。真嗣笑得像狼一样。

"Fine! Whatever! Just hurry up so I can tell…EEEEEEEK!" Asuka screamed as Shinji rushed up behind her and scooped her up in his arms. The startled redhead kicked her legs furiously in the air as Shinji spun her around, "Ikari, you asshole! Put me down now!"  
“好吧！不管怎样！快点，这样我就可以告诉……EEEEEEEK！”明日香尖叫起来，真嗣冲到她身后，将她抱在怀里。受到惊吓的红发女郎在空中猛烈地踢着双腿，真嗣把她转了过来，“碇，你这个混蛋！现在就把我放下来！”

"Uh uh! Not till you say the magic words!" he said as he continued to spin her around, cradled safely in his arms.  
“呃呃！除非你说出咒语！”他一边说，一边继续把她安全地抱在怀里，转来转去。

"Now, you jerk!" she screamed as Shinji laughed his head off.  
“现在，你这个混蛋！”当真嗣笑得前仰后合时，她尖叫起来。

"Wrong words!" he replied between chuckles as he stopped spinning and held her above the bed. Asuka's eyes widened when she saw his bare chest. He had managed to slip partially out of his suit before he grabbed her.  
“说错话了！”他一边轻笑一边回答，停止了旋转，把她抱到了床上。当明日香看到他裸露的胸膛时，她睁大了眼睛。在抓住她之前，他已经成功地脱掉了部分西装。

"Please, Shinji?" she asked as he gently placed her on top of their bed and gazed down on her face.  
“请问，慎二？”当他轻轻地将她放在床上并低头凝视着她的脸时，她问道。

"Still not the right words," he whispered, smiling gently. _She has never looked happier, despite everything that's going on right now,_ Shinji thought to himself as his lady smiled back up at him.  
“还是不太恰当。”他轻声说道，温柔地微笑着。尽管现在发生了这一切，但她看起来从来没有这么快乐过，当他的女士对他微笑时，真嗣心里想。

"Idiot," Asuka replied without malice, "I love you," she whispered to him. His grin grew exponentially.  
“白痴，”明日香毫无恶意地回答，“我爱你，”她低声对他说。他的笑容呈指数级增长。

"Those were the magic words," he replied as he bend down and gave her a kiss.  
“这些都是神奇的话语，”他弯下腰吻了她，回答道。

"God, you're so damn sappy!" she replied as she sat up and returned the favor, before the sound of a throat being cleared interrupted their happy moment. They turned to see Hikari and Rei standing in the doorway of their room, a shocked look on the class representative's face and an annoyed one on Rei's.  
“天呐，你真是太蠢了！”她坐起来回应道，然后清嗓子的声音打断了他们的幸福时光。他们转身看到Hikari和Rei站在他们的房间门口，班代表的脸上露出震惊的表情，而Rei的脸上则露出恼怒的表情。

"Forgotten what we have to do, I see," Rei said as crossed her arms and scowled at the young couple. They quickly stood as Shinji struggled back into his flight suit, as both look shamed faced. Asuka quickly recovered and gave her future husband a quick kiss.  
“我明白了，忘了我们要做什么了，”雷交叉双臂，皱着眉头看着这对年轻夫妇。当真嗣挣扎着穿上飞行服时，他们迅速站了起来，两人都一脸羞愧。明日香很快回过神来，给了她未来的丈夫一个飞快的吻。

"Shinji, what are you doing in Asuka's room, and why was she screaming?" Hikari asked, looking ready to beat the snot out of him. She was so sure Shinji Ikari was a nice guy, but now she had some doubts.  
“真嗣，你在明日香的房间里做什么？她为什么尖叫？”光问道，看上去准备打他的鼻涕。她曾经确信碇真嗣是个好人，但现在她有些怀疑了。

"It's his room, too, Hikari," Asuka replied as she gathered her handbag and scooted out the door, shooing the other two girls away. "We'll be married in less than two weeks, so we started sharing the room already. Don't look so shocked! I'll explain it better on the way to the Mall! Come on!"  
“这也是他的房间，光。”明日香一边回答，一边拿起手提包，冲出了门，把另外两个女孩赶走了。 “不到两周我们就要结婚了，所以我们已经开始共用房间了。别显得那么震惊！我会在去购物中心的路上更好地解释它！来吧！”

"Don't forget these," Shinji said as he passed car keys to Asuka, who quickly gave them to her aunt. Shinji was still surprised that Asuka never got her license, despite the fact she was an ace EVA pilot. That was a small part of the mystery people called Asuka.  
“别忘了这些，”真嗣边说边把车钥匙递给明日香，明日香很快就把车钥匙交给了她的阿姨。尽管明日香是一名 EVA 王牌飞行员，但真嗣仍然对明日香从未获得执照感到惊讶。那是被称为明日香的神秘人的一小部分。

"Thanks! We'll be back as soon as we can!" she said as she ran back over to him and gave him a quick kiss. Hikari was still in a state of shock.  
“谢谢！我们会尽快回来的！”她一边说，一边跑回他身边，快速地吻了他一下。光仍处于震惊之中。

"Sure you will," he smirked as he was all too familiar with Asuka's shopping habits. She gave him a wink as she and the others left.  
“你当然会的，”他傻笑着说，因为他太熟悉明日香的购物习惯了。当她和其他人离开时，她向他眨了眨眼。

"Don't wait up!" “别等了！”

"You know I will," he replied as the door slid shut. He retreated back to his room to finish changing his clothes when noticed Misato sitting at the table and looking at him like he was fresh bait and she was a shark. He realized that he had just given Misato enough fresh ammunition for a month's worth of teasing. Sticking his tongue out at her, he shut the door quickly, but not before he heard the peals of laughter coming from his older roommate. "Oh god, this is gonna suck!"  
“你知道我会的，”门关上时他回答道。他回到自己的房间换完衣服，发现美里坐在桌边，看着他，就像他是新鲜的鱼饵，而她是一条鲨鱼。他意识到自己刚刚给了美里足够的新弹药，足以应付一个月的戏弄。他向她伸出舌头，迅速关上门，但随后他听到了年长室友传来的阵阵笑声。 “天哪，这太糟糕了！”

### Chapter 4
**A/N:** _I want to apologize to everyone for how long it has taken me to finish and post this chapter. I had several major problems in my personal life occur since the last chapter was posted, the worst being the death of my father. This plunged me into a rather bad depression, causing any and all creative juices to stop flowing for a while. I now dedicate his story to my father, Charles Gordon Talley. He was a cantankerous old fart, but he was my father, I loved him, and I shall miss him. Thank you-Lord Talon._  
我想向大家道歉，因为我花了很长时间才完成并发布这一章。自从上一章发布以来，我的个人生活中出现了几个重大问题，其中最糟糕的是我父亲的去世。这让我陷入了相当严重的抑郁症，导致所有的创造力暂时停止流动。现在我把他的故事献给我的父亲查尔斯·戈登·塔利。他是个脾气暴躁的老家伙，但他是我的父亲，我爱他，我会想念他的。谢谢你——泰隆大人。

---

Shinji sighed as he tried to relax, as Asuka snuggled up to him and drifted off to sleep. Her rhythmic breathing calmed him somewhat, but the events of the past week loomed in his mind. As hard as he and Asuka had tried to hide the fact that they were engaged, the news spread through the school like wildfire. The ring on her finger was a dead giveaway, he smiled at how proud Asuka was to wear it. He felt bad that he couldn't get her a better one, but he knew she would be happy with the matching wedding ring that went with it. Asuka wanted to get him a fancy ring as well, but he insisted on just a simple gold band.  
真嗣叹了口气，试图放松下来，明日香依偎着他，渐渐睡着了。她有节奏的呼吸让他稍微平静了一些，但上周发生的事情却在他脑海中浮现。尽管他和明日香极力隐瞒他们订婚的事实，这个消息还是像野火一样传遍了学校。她手指上的戒指完全暴露了他的身份，他微笑着看到明日香戴着它是多么自豪。他为无法给她买一枚更好的戒指而感到难过，但他知道她会对与之相配的结婚戒指感到满意。明日香也想给他买一枚精美的戒指，但他坚持只买一枚简单的金戒指。

The week had gone by in a flash, between school, NERV, and making preparations for the wedding. The shopping trip with Touji, Kensuke, and Kaji was …interesting…to say the least…  
一周的时间一晃而过，忙着上学、NERV、筹备婚礼。与 Touji、Kensuke 和 Kaji 一起的购物之旅……有趣……至少可以说……

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Tuesday 周二_

"Aw, dude, this is embarrassing!" Touji complained as the tailor rushed around him, taking his measurements and making sure that the tuxedo that had been picked out was the proper fit. "Man, I don't wanna look like a penguin!"  
“哎哟，哥们儿，这可真是丢人啊！”当裁缝冲到他身边测量尺寸并确保挑选出来的燕尾服合身时，东治抱怨道。 “伙计，我不想看起来像一只企鹅！”

"Don't let Pen-Pen hear you say that," Shinji replied as he endured his torture with a pleasant smile on his face. Normally, he would run from such attention, but this wasn't a normal circumstance. He wanted everything to be perfect for Asuka, and if she wished him in a tuxedo, she was going to get it.  
“别让潘潘听到你这么说。”真嗣一边回答，一边忍受着折磨，脸上挂着愉快的微笑。正常情况下，他会逃避这样的关注，但这不是正常情况。他希望明日香的一切都是完美的，如果她希望他穿燕尾服，她就会得到它。

"Yeah, that's one tough penguin," Kaji added as he stood leaning against a nearby doorframe, his fitting complete, " Trust me, he'll bitch-slap all the way back to Second Impact if he heard you gripping about looking like him!" Shinji and Kensuke joined Kaji in a good chuckle as Touji stood there, glowering. He looked he was ready to leave right then and there when suddenly, he straightened out and stared out the front window of shop. That drew everyone's eyes to the same place.  
“是的，那是一只坚强的企鹅，”卡吉补充道，他靠在附近的门框上，他的试衣已经完成，“相信我，如果他听到你因为长得像他而紧张，他会一直拍打你的屁股回到第二次冲击。” ！”真嗣和健介和加持一起咯咯地笑起来，而东二则站在那儿，怒目而视。他看上去正准备离开，突然，他直起身子，凝视着商店的前窗外。这让所有人的目光都集中到了同一个地方。

Hikari was standing outside the window, looking in and admiring how he looked in his suit. Asuka, Rei and Misato stood there as well, waving at the guys inside when Misato got a mischievous look on her face. Pulling several bills from her purse, she started waving them in the air and calling out to them.  
光站在窗外，向内看去，欣赏着他穿着西装的样子。明日香、丽和美里也站在那里，向里面的人挥手，这时美里露出了顽皮的表情。她从钱包里拿出几张钞票，开始在空中挥舞它们并大声喊叫。

"Woo-hoo! Come on guys! Work for it! Shake that little money maker!!" she screamed as Asuka and Rei took up the cat calls as well, waving singles in the air. Hikari, for her part, took about three steps back and looked around, trying to go unnoticed.  
“呜呼！加油，伙计们！努力吧！摇晃那个小赚钱机器！！”她尖叫起来，明日香和丽也接起了猫的叫声，在空中挥舞着单打。光则向后退了三步左右，环顾四周，试图不被人注意到。

"Excuse me? _Little_? Is that a challenge?" Kaji said as he stood from the doorframe and gave Shinji a nudge, who looked a bit confused for a second as Kaji motioned toward Touji, the window, and the objects of their affections. A silly grin grew on his face as he got what Kaji was thinking about, and turned to look at Kensuke.  
“请问？小？这是一个挑战吗？”梶说道，他站在门框上，轻轻推了推真嗣，当梶指向东二、窗户和他们心爱的对象时，真嗣看上去有点困惑。明白了梶的想法后，他的脸上露出了傻笑，转头看向健介。

"Uh uh! No way! You just go ahead and embarrass yourselves, I'll hang back!" Kensuke whispered as Shinji and Kaji stepped forward and grabbed Touji by the arms and dragged him to the window in front of the ladies, who were now starting to draw a small crowd. The tailor stood back in mild amusement as Kaji and Shinji whispered their plan to Touji, who at first looked mortified, then calmed down when Kaji told him to just look at Hikari and have some fun.  
“呃呃！不行！你就继续丢人现眼吧，我就躲着了！”剑介低声说道，真嗣和梶走上前，抓住东次的手臂，把他拖到女士们面前的窗户上，女士们现在开始吸引一小群人了。当加持和真嗣向东司低声讲述他们的计划时，裁缝有些好笑地往后退了一步，东司一开始看起来很尴尬，但当加持告诉他只看光并玩得开心时，东司平静下来。

"Oh, what the hell! It's not like anyone at school is going to see this," Touji replied, not realizing that Kensuke had his ever present camera with him and was starting to record the whole thing. Together, the guys started to dance, or at least attempt to dance, before the ladies.  
“哦，见鬼！学校里的人不会看到这个，”东次回答道，他没有意识到健介带着他随身携带的相机，并开始记录整个过程。男人们一起开始在女士们面前跳舞，或者至少尝试跳舞。

"You don't think that…" Rei whispered to the others as Asuka and Hikari's eyes got bigger. Misato's grin just got bigger as she started to yell even louder, her delight growing as the guys synchronized their movements, step for step and move for move.  
“你们不认为……”丽对其他人低声说道，明日香和光的眼睛睁得更大。美里的笑容越来越大，她开始喊得更大声，随着男人们同步动作、一步一步、一步一步地移动，她的喜悦也越来越大。

"Not a chance, " Hikari added, red faced, but smiling, seeing Touji having so much fun and acting silly.  
“没机会，”光补充道，看到东司玩得很开心，而且还表现得很傻，他脸红了，但微笑着。

"If Shinji doesn't, I'll beat the crap out of him when we get home!" Asuka said as she watched her fiancé make an absolute fool of himself in the window, and was loving every minute of it. She still wasn't sure what had happened to Shinji Ikari, but it was a change for the better. He had finally opened up and was acting like a real person.  
“如果真嗣不这么做，我们回家后我一定把他打得落花流水！”明日香一边看着未婚夫在窗外出丑，一边说道，她很享受这样的每一分钟。她仍然不确定碇真嗣发生了什么事，但情况已经好转了。他终于敞开心扉，表现得像一个真正的人了。

"I bet you that they won't do it," Rei said as she watched her brother and the other two in amazement. It had taken Asuka and Shinji a week at learn how to move together like that, how the three idiots in the window had learned how to do it in just a matters of moments was completely beyond her.  
“我敢打赌，他们不会这么做，”雷惊讶地看着她的哥哥和另外两个人，说道。明日香和真嗣花了一周的时间才学会如何一起移动，而窗外的三个白痴是如何在短短的时间内学会如何做到这一点的，她完全无法理解。

"I'll take that bet," Misato said as the show in the window was starting to get wilder, "How do you think Kaji paid his way through college? That's how I first met him!"  
“我愿意打赌，”当橱窗里的景象开始变得更加疯狂时，美里说道，“你认为加持是如何支付大学学费的？我就是这样第一次见到他的！”

"Oh my god, they're taking off their jackets!" Hikari gasped as she turned an even deeper shade of red as she realized just exactly what it was the guys were doing.  
“天啊，他们要脱外套了！”光倒吸一口冷气，她的脸色变得更深了，因为她意识到这些家伙到底在做什么。

"Yup! And next come the ties!" Misato yelled over the loud crowd as she gave the three young ladies a wink. "Woo-hoo! Come on, baby! Work it!" She was answered by a wave from all three idiots in the widow. The tailor stood there and laughed his butt off.  
“是的！接下来是领带！”美里一边对着喧闹的人群大喊，一边向三位年轻女士眨了眨眼。 “呜呼！来吧，宝贝！努力吧！”回应她的是寡妇中的三个白痴向她挥手。裁缝站在那儿笑得前仰后合。

"Oh crap! They're taking off their shirts!" Hikari exclaimed as she watched them start unbuttoning their shirts and pulling them from their slacks. As one, they pulled them off and started twirling them in the air like lassos. Asuka and Rei stood and giggled at the spectacle before them, until Asuka started watching her fiancé much closer.  
“哦糟糕！他们正在脱衬衫！”当光看到他们开始解开衬衫的纽扣并把它们从裤子里拉出来时，她惊呼道。他们合而为一地把它们拉下来，开始像套索一样在空中旋转。明日香和丽站在那里，看着眼前的景象咯咯地笑，直到明日香开始更仔细地观察她的未婚夫。

She felt as if she was seeing him for the first time in a very long time. Having never seen him shirtless before, except in brief accidental glimpses and the incident the night before, she had never seen how well Shinji Ikari was developing. His abs were very well defined, not quite a six-pack, but getting there. His arms were no longer the skinny toothpicks they were when she had first met Shinji, but were nicely muscled, as was his chest.  
她感觉好像很长一段时间以来第一次见到他。她以前从未见过他赤裸上身，除了短暂的偶然瞥见和前一天晚上的事件外，她从未见过碇真嗣的发育有多好。他的腹肌轮廓分明，虽不是六块腹肌，但也已经到了。他的手臂不再像她第一次见到真嗣时那样瘦削的牙签，而是肌肉发达，他的胸部也是如此。

_"Hmm, no wonder he was able to take care of those orderlies so easily!"_ she thought to herself as she thought back to the incident in the medical wing. She looked around and saw the size of the crowd they had drawn with the impromptu striptease, most of which were women. Looking from Shinji and back to the women, Asuka felt a surge of jealousy course through her heart, as she realized that they were enjoying watching her fiancé! She felt something else stir within her as she flushed from head to toe, and she quickly realized that she simply did NOT want her fiancé to parade himself before all those lecherous female eyes!  
“嗯，难怪他能这么轻松地解决那些勤务兵！”她一边想着，一边回想起医疗翼里发生的事情。她环顾四周，看到他们即兴脱衣舞吸引来的人群有多大，其中大多数是女性。看看真嗣，再看看女人们，明日香心中升起了一股嫉妒，因为她发现她们很享受看着她的未婚夫！她感觉自己心里有什么东西在蠢蠢欲动，从头到脚都红了，她很快就意识到，她根本不想让自己的未婚夫在那些好色的女人眼前炫耀！

"Shinji Ikari, you had better…" she started to mutter, but before she could finish, the guys started to dance away from the window, their pants at least still in place as a curtain was slowly drawn across the window by the still laughing tailor. He was extremely pleased, because he knew he couldn't buy better publicity than the stunt the NERV personnel had just pulled.  
“碇慎司，你最好……”她开始嘀咕，但还没等她说完，那些家伙就开始跳舞离开窗户，他们的裤子至少还在原地，窗帘被仍在笑的人慢慢地拉过窗户。裁缝。他非常高兴，因为他知道他无法买到比 NERV 人员刚刚施展的噱头更好的宣传了。

"Wow! That brings back some great memories!" Misato said as she turned back to the three girls, but her smile quickly faded as she saw how pale Asuka had become. "Asuka, are you alright?" The young redhead seemed to sway a bit as Rei and Hikari quickly rushed to her side to keep her from falling. Misato was ready to call for Shinji when Asuka waved her off.  
“哇！这让我回想起一些美好的回忆！”美里一边说着，一边转身对着三女，但看到明日香脸色苍白的样子，她的笑容很快就消失了。 “明日香，你没事吧？”红发少女似乎摇晃了一下，丽和光赶紧冲到她身边，阻止她摔倒。美里正准备呼唤真嗣，明日香挥手示意她离开。

"I'm…I'm fine, Misato! Just a bit dizzy, that's all," she said as her guardian and friends looked completely unconvinced. "I'm fine! Really! Sheesh! I just need something to eat, I think I missed breakfast this morning!" Misato merely cocked an eyebrow at her response, since she knew perfectly well that Asuka had eaten a rather large German breakfast that morning.  
“我……我很好，美里！只是有点头晕，仅此而已。”她说道，而她的监护人和朋友们看起来完全不相信。 “我很好！真的！天哪！我只是需要吃点东西，我想我今天早上错过了早餐！”美里只是对她的回答挑了挑眉，因为她很清楚明日香那天早上吃了一顿相当丰盛的德国早餐。

"Asuka, are you sure?" Rei asked as she looked at her fellow pilot, concern plainly on her face. Asuka was touched by the care her friends were showing for her. The old Asuka would have railed against such sympathies, but many things had changed since she had come to Tokyo-3, the tiny life growing within her being the biggest. It had opened her world to so many wonderful things that she had previously closed herself off from, especially the love of a certain young man that had just made a fool of himself for her enjoyment. A small smile came to her face at what she had planned to accomplish with this latest trip to the Mall.  
“明日香，你确定吗？”丽看着她的飞行员同伴问道，脸上写满了担忧。明日香被朋友们对她的关心所感动。老飞鸟可能会反对这种同情，但自从她来到第三东京以来，很多事情都发生了变化，她体内成长的微小生命是最大的。它打开了她的世界，让她看到了许多以前封闭自己的美好事物，尤其是某个年轻人的爱情，刚刚为了她的享受而出丑。对于她最近一次去购物中心的计划所要完成的事情，她脸上露出了一丝微笑。

" Yeah, I'm sure, Rei," Asuka replied as pulled herself together and started herding her friends toward the food court, " I just need to feed the kiddo, you know! Come on, the sooner we eat, the sooner we can get to the music store! We got some serious shopping to do….."  
“是的，我确定，丽，”明日香回答道，她振作起来，开始带领她的朋友们走向美食广场，“我只是需要喂那个孩子，你知道！来吧，我们越早吃，我们就越早可以去音乐商店了！我们要去买一些东西……”

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Wednesday 周三_

Shinji tried to keep from rubbing his shoulder as he stood before his father's desk. Asuka came home in a foul mood the previous night and had slugged him several times in the shoulder before tears welled up in her eyes and she collapsed into his arms. Shinji was extremely concerned, to say the least, as he turned to look at Misato for some clue as to what had caused the outburst. Misato was uncharacteristically quiet as she returned Shinji's glance, then retreated from the kitchen with Heidi in tow. After a while, Asuka stopped crying , snuggled up to him and apologized for hitting him. She refused to tell him what was wrong, but her kisses to the injured area helped to chase the worry from Shinji's mind for the nonce.  
当真嗣站在父亲的办公桌前时，他努力克制自己不去碰自己的肩膀。前一天晚上，明日香心情不好回到家，猛击了他的肩膀好几下，然后她的眼里涌出了泪水，倒在了他的怀里。至少可以说，真嗣非常担心，他转头看着美里，想寻找一些线索来解释到底是什么原因导致了这次爆发。美里一反常态地安静地看了真嗣一眼，然后带着海蒂退出了厨房。过了一会儿，明日香停止哭泣，依偎在他身边，为打他而道歉。她拒绝告诉他出了什么问题，但她对受伤部位的亲吻有助于暂时驱散真嗣心中的担忧。

"What is it, Captain?" Gendo asked, not coldly, as Shinji stood before him. "I believe you have some reports for me?" Shinji stood at parade rest, then relaxed somewhat as his father nodded for him begin.  
“什么事，队长？”真嗣站在他面前，源堂并不冷漠地问道。 “我相信你有一些报告给我？”真嗣在游行中休息，然后在他父亲点头示意他开始时放松了一些。

"Indeed," he replied as he placed several report folders on the Commander's desk then stood back as Gendo picked them up and flipped through them. His father's eyes actually widened a bit as he stopped and passed the report over to Fuyutsuki. The Sub-Commander's face remained impassive as usual, but a strange twinkle grew in his eyes as he glanced through the folder. He and Gendo nodded to each other as they turned back to Shinji.  
“确实如此，”他回答道，同时将几个报告文件夹放在指挥官的办公桌上，然后退后一步，让源堂拿起它们并翻阅它们。父亲的眼睛实际上睁大了一点，他停下来，将报告递给了冬月。副司令的脸色一如既往的冷漠，但当他翻阅文件夹的时候，眼中却闪过一丝异样的光芒。他和源堂互相点点头，然后转向真嗣。

"As you can see, gentlemen," Shinji started, his own face remaining impassive, " this report shows how much money can be saved, how much property can be salvaged, and how many lives can be saved if we move to intercept the Angels outside of Tokyo-3. I believe that this can be a huge P.R. boost for NERV, and may be able to convince the U.N. of the necessity of increasing our budget for certain projects. It merely has to see that we are interested in saving ALL human lives, not just Humanity as a whole."  
“正如你们所看到的，先生们，”真嗣开始说道，他的表情依然冷漠，“这份报告表明，如果我们采取行动拦截天使，可以节省多少钱，可以挽救多少财产，可以挽救多少生命。”在第三东京之外，我相信这对 NERV 来说是一个巨大的公关提升，并且可能能够让联合国相信我们有必要增加某些项目的预算。人类的生命，而不仅仅是整个人类的生命。”

"And these projects you have outlined here?" Gendo asked, his face hidden behind his gloved hands, as usual. Shinji thought it was rather childish of his father at trying to hide himself from everyone else.  
“你在这里列出的这些项目呢？”源堂像往常一样，将脸藏在戴着手套的双手后面问道。真嗣认为他父亲试图向其他人隐藏自己的行为相当幼稚。

"Research here shows that we can produce anti-Angelic weaponry without the need to use an EVA. It may not be able to kill an Angel, but it should be able to damage it and slow it down enough for an EVA to intercept it outside of the city. Fighting a damaged Angel will greatly increase the odds of a victory for the EVA with less damage to the unit." Shinji explained. "Using the information we have on the Lance of Longinus, we should be able to replicate it on a somewhat smaller scale. As stated earlier, they may not be able to destroy an Angel, but it should be strong enough to pierce any A.T. field and at least damage the Angel."  
“这里的研究表明，我们可以在不需要使用 EVA 的情况下生产反天使武器。它可能无法杀死天使，但它应该能够损坏它并减慢它的速度，以便 EVA 在外面拦截它与受损的天使战斗将大大增加 EVA 的胜利几率，同时减少对部队的伤害。”慎二解释道。 「根据我们掌握的朗基努斯之枪的情报，我们应该能够在较小的规模上复制它。正如之前所说，他们可能无法摧毁天使，但它的强度应该足以穿透任何 A.T. 领域。」至少伤害天使。”

"Where did you get the information on the Lance, Captain?" Gendo asked, somewhat perplexed. There had been earlier reports, many years back, claiming the same. He had thought he had all of these destroyed long ago. In fact, most of this information looked extremely familiar.  
“船长，你从哪里得到有关长枪号的信息？”源堂有些困惑地问道。许多年前就有过更早的报道，也有同样的说法。他以为他早就把这些都毁掉了。事实上，大部分信息看起来都非常熟悉。

"From the Magi, Commander," Shinji replied, "It was hard to find, but if you dig deep enough, you can find just about anything there. Obviously, back when the EVAs were being constructed, diverting resources to such negligible projects was a waste. However, with all three EVAs complete and in good condition, we can explore other means of defense." Gendo raised an eyebrow at Shinji's answer and reasoning.  
“来自魔法师，指挥官，”真嗣回答道，“很难找到，但如果你挖得足够深，你几乎可以在那里找到任何东西。显然，在建造 EVA 的时候，将资源转移到这些微不足道的项目上是很不明智的。”然而，由于三艘 EVA 均已完成且状况良好，我们可以探索其他防御手段。”源堂对真嗣的回答和推理扬起了眉毛。

"So you do understand why such avenues weren't followed in the first place?" the Commander asked.  
“所以你明白为什么这些途径一开始就没有被采用吗？”指挥官问道。

"Yes, I do," Shinji answered, "but now that time has passed, and this is an avenue we must explore." The elder Ikari and Fuyutsuki looked at each other, not knowing how to bypass this argument and reasoning. Shinji had a point.  
“是的，我愿意，”真嗣回答，“但现在时间已经过去了，这是我们必须探索的一条途径。”碇长老和冬月面面相觑，不知道该如何绕过这种争论和推理。真嗣说得有道理。

"What about this next item, Captain?" Fuyutsuki asked a he picked up the next folder. Gendo nodded at the question. Shinji sighed a bit before giving his explanation.  
“下一个项目怎么样，队长？”冬月问道，然后拿起了下一个文件夹。源堂对这个问题点了点头。真嗣叹了口气，给出了解释。

"Unfortunately, it has been demonstrated time and again that the security forces employed by NERV are incapable of the tasks of which they have been charged. Section 2 has been shown to be a joke, and in simulated drills run in the past, the armed security forces have been stymied by their inability to find arms, supplies, and actual locations! I had the firearms testing scores of ALL security personnel pulled, and I was extremely dismayed." Shinji said as a small flash of concern showed on his face, but only briefly.  
“不幸的是，事实一再证明，NERV 雇用的安全部队没有能力完成他们所承担的任务。第 2 部分已被证明是一个笑话，在过去进行的模拟演习中，武装人员安全部队因无法找到武器、物资和实际位置而受到阻碍！我撤回了所有安全人员的枪支测试分数，我感到非常沮丧。”真嗣说道，脸上闪过一丝担忧，但只是短暂的。

"How so, Captain?" Gendo asked, wondering what Shinji worried about.  
“怎么样，队长？”源堂问道，想知道真嗣在担心什么。

"The average score on the qualification tests were abysmal, scoring only a thirty-nine out of a possible one hundred. Along with the fact that over fifty percent of the security forces have not gone back and re-qualified in the required amount of time, as stated in NERV regulations, leads me to believe we have a serious flaw in our training programs and security." Shinji concluded, placing his hands behind his back. Gendo was, in a word, annoyed. He picked the report up and read through it carefully as Shinji and Fuyutsuki stood by, patiently.  
“资格测试的平均分数很糟糕，在满分一百分中只得到了三十九分。此外，超过百分之五十的安全部队没有在规定的时间内返回并重新获得资格正如 NERV 法规中所述，这让我相信我们的培训计划和安全性存在严重缺陷。”真嗣把手背在背后总结道。一言以蔽之，源堂很恼火。他拿起报告仔细阅读，真嗣和冬月则耐心地站在一旁。

"Why have I not been informed of this sooner?" Gendo growled. He made it a point to read every report that crossed his desk, and had specific instructions for a security report to be made every week. Nothing in the reports ever showed this kind of problem. "Who is in charge of security, again?"  
“为什么没有早点通知我这件事？”源多咆哮道。他特别强调要阅读办公桌上的每一份报告，并明确要求每周制作一份安全报告。报告中没有任何内容显示出此类问题。 “再说一遍，谁负责安全？”

"Lieutenant Tanaka, sir," Shinji and Fuyutsuki replied as one, startling Gendo somewhat.  
“田中中尉，长官。”真嗣和冬月异口同声地回答道，这让源堂有些吃惊。

"Make arraignments for Tanaka to be brought before me after this meeting," he said to the Sub-Commander, who nodded curtly. "What, may I ask, caused you to become concerned with the details of NERV security, Captain?" Gendo knew the answer, but wanted confirmation.  
“在这次会议之后，将田中传唤到我面前，”他对副司令说，副司令简短地点了点头。 “请问，是什么让你开始关心 NERV 安全的细节，队长？”源堂知道答案，但想要确认。

"I have my reasons, sir," Shinji stated, _"Four of them, to be exact,"_ he thought to himself. His father merely nodded.  
“我有我的理由，先生，”真嗣说道，“确切地说，有四个，”他心里想。他的父亲只是点点头。

"And what do you propose that we do to remedy this situation?" the elder Ikari asked.  
“你建议我们采取什么措施来纠正这种情况？”碇长老问道。

"First off, have all security personnel immediately re-qualify with their firearms. Any score below a seventy will be considered a failing grade and said personnel will be pulled from the active roster until such time as they re-qualify, or fail to pass a third and final time." Shinji answered, stone cold in his resolve.  
“首先，让所有安保人员立即重新获得枪支资格。任何低于七十分的分数都将被视为不及格，并表示人员将从现役名单中删除，直到他们重新获得资格或未能通过第三次也是最后一次。”真嗣回答道，他的决心冰冷如石。

"Isn't that kind of harsh, Captain?" Fuyutsuki wondered, somewhat alarmed at the change that had overcome the younger Ikari.  
“这样是不是太严厉了，队长？”冬月想知道，对年轻的碇的变化感到有些震惊。

"Begging your pardon, sir," Shinji replied through clinched teeth, "but if I can qualify with a score of eighty-five, being a rank beginner, then surely the so-called 'professionals' can score a seventy, if they wish to keep their jobs."  
“请原谅，先生，”真嗣咬紧牙关回答道，“但如果我能以八十五分的成绩获得资格，作为一个初级者，那么那些所谓的‘职业选手’如果愿意的话，当然也可以得到七十分。以保住他们的工作。”

_"Ouch!"_ the two commanders thought in unison. Shinji took a calming breath and continued.  
“哎哟！”两位指挥官异口同声的想到。真嗣平静地吸了口气，继续说道。

"Second, I propose the creation of an elite security unit who's job it will be to prevent and repulse any attack or incursion on NERV or NERV personnel. They will all be ready for combat at a moment's notice, and they will know the layout of headquarters better than they know the layout of their own anatomy." Fuyutsuki had to bite back a chuckle at Shinji's remark. Gendo smiled behind his hands.  
“第二，我建议建立一支精锐安全部队，其职责是防止和击退针对 NERV 或 NERV 人员的任何攻击或入侵。他们都将立即做好战斗准备，并且他们会了解他们比他们更了解自己的解剖结构。”听到真嗣的话，冬月不得不强忍住笑声。源多双手背后微笑。

"Who would be in command of the unit?" Gendo asked, wondering if Shinji had thought it out.  
“谁来指挥这个部队？”源堂问道，想知道真嗣是否已经想好了。

"Over all command would fall under Major Katsuragi," Shinji replied, "But the field commander will be up to you. The unit will be divided up amongst four teams: The Berserkers, The Spartans, The Furies, and The Corsairs. Each team will be assigned a color and a quadrant of headquarters that will be their responsibility. That quadrant will be color coded same as the team to help prevent future confusion. Each team will assign men to take over Section 2's duties in guarding the EVA pilots, as well." Gendo was pleasantly surprised, Shinji had thought it through.  
“总体指挥权由葛城少校负责，”真嗣回答道，“但战地指挥官将由你决定。该部队将分为四支队伍：狂战士、斯巴达、复仇女神和海盗。每支队伍将被分配一个颜色和一个象限，该象限将与团队相同的颜色编码，以帮助防止未来的混乱，每个团队将指派人员接管第 2 部分保护 EVA 飞行员的职责。出色地。”源堂惊喜不已，真嗣已经想通了。

_"He is becoming quite formidable,"_ the elder Ikari thought of his son, "_at last!"_ Clearing his throat, Gendo spoke up "I shall take your recommendations under advisement, Captain. Does your training go well?"  
“他变得非常强大了，”老碇想起他的儿子，“终于！”源堂清了清嗓子，说道：“我会采纳你的建议，队长。你的训练进展顺利吗？”

"Thus far," Shinji replied, "Most of what I have learned has been use of firearms and after-mission reports. The Major is working on a more detailed training schedule to be implemented within the next several weeks."  
“到目前为止，”真嗣回答道，“我学到的大部分内容都是枪械的使用和任务后报告。少校正在制定更详细的训练计划，将在接下来的几周内实施。”

"I see" his father said, as his eyes narrowed in anticipation of the next part of the meeting. "Is there anything else, Captain?" Shinji felt his stomach start to tie itself in knots, but he refused to allow the discomfort to show on his face. He would not give his father the satisfaction. Gendo merely sat there, waiting for a reply.  
“我明白了，”他的父亲说道，他眯起了眼睛，期待着会议的下一部分。 “队长还有什么事吗？”真嗣感觉自己的胃开始打结，但他拒绝让不适表现在脸上。他不会让他的父亲满意。源多只是坐在那里，等待着答复。

"Indeed," Shinji stated as he steeled himself for what was to come. He was absolutely positive that his father knew that he planned to wed Asuka, but he still wasn't sure as to what his reaction would be. Shinji drew himself up taller as he began.  
“确实如此，”真嗣一边说道，一边为即将发生的事情做好了准备。他绝对确信他的父亲知道他计划与明日香结婚，但他仍然不确定他的反应会是什么。真嗣一开始就挺直了身子。

"As you may well know, I have asked the Second Child for her hand in marriage. She has agreed to become my wife," Shinji said, shaking violently on the inside as he came up to the most crucial part of the entire visit.  
“你可能很清楚，我已经向老二求婚了。她已经同意成为我的妻子，”真嗣说道，当他谈到整个访问中最关键的部分时，他的内心剧烈地颤抖着。

"Yes, I am aware of it," Gendo replied, his face a mask. "The fact that you are willing to accept another man's responsibility is commendable." Shinji was shocked at the compliment.  
“是的，我知道，”源堂回答道，脸上戴着面具。 “你愿意承担另一个人的责任，这是值得称赞的。”听到这样的夸奖，真嗣感到很震惊。

"I wonder," Fuyutsuki asked with concern, "is it fair to Asuka and her child? Is it fair to you, Shinji? After all, you only asked her because she's pregnant. While that is very valiant of you, I have my concerns." Shinji stiffened at the Sub-Commander's comments.  
“我想知道，”冬月关心地问道，“这对明日香和她的孩子公平吗？这对真嗣你公平吗？毕竟你只是因为她怀孕了才问她的。虽然你很勇敢，但我也有我的想法。”的担忧。”听到副司令的话，真嗣的表情僵住了。

"I asked her because I love her, sir," Shinji replied coldly, as he had not expected such doubts from Fuyutsuki, "and she said 'yes' for the same reason. The baby was a factor, but not the only one."  
“我问她是因为我爱她，先生，”真嗣冷冷地回答，他没想到冬月会提出这样的疑问，“她也出于同样的原因说‘是’。孩子是一个因素，但不是唯一的因素。” ”

"I apologize, Captain," Fuyutsuki said as he bowed slightly, "I meant no offense. I was merely concerned with your and the Second's welfare." Shinji's posture relaxed somewhat as he turned back toward his father.  
“抱歉，队长。”冬月微微鞠了一躬，“我没有冒犯的意思，我只是关心你和二号的安危。”真嗣的姿势放松了一些，转身面向父亲。

"Since we are both military personnel and under your command, I am following protocol and I am asking for permission for the two of us to wed." Gendo's eyes widened imperceptibly at what Shinji had just asked. He had never expected it.  
“既然我们都是军人，都在你的指挥下，我就遵守礼节，请求你允许我们两个结婚。”听到真嗣的问话，源堂不自觉地睁大了眼睛。他万万没想到会这样。

"If I were to refuse your request?" he probed, wondering what Shinji's reaction would be. Shinji, for his part, was not affected. He had always figured that this was coming.  
“如果我拒绝你的要求呢？”他试探着，想知道真嗣会有什么反应。真嗣则没有受到影响。他一直认为这一切即将到来。

"Then we would proceed as planned, anyway," Shinji answered truthfully, taking both commanders by surprise. "It was merely a courtesy and a formality to seek the Commander's blessing."  
“那么无论如何，我们都会按计划进行。”真嗣如实回答，让两位指挥官都大吃一惊。 “这只是一种礼貌和形式，寻求指挥官的祝福。”

"And what of my blessing as your father?" the elder Ikari asked, startling Shinji somewhat. He hid it well as he replied.  
“那我作为你父亲的祝福呢？”碇长老问道，真嗣有些吃惊。他回答的时候隐藏得很好。

"In all honesty, I hadn't thought to ask for your blessing as my father," Shinji said, trying to hide the bitterness and sadness in his voice. "I was under the impression that it wouldn't matter to you."  
“说实话，我并没有想过要请求你作为我父亲的祝福。”真嗣说道，试图掩饰声音中的苦涩和悲伤。 “我的印象是这对你来说并不重要。”

"Ah," Gendo replied, as a strange feeling began to creep through his body. Disappointment? Regret? He wasn't sure, but he did not enjoy it. "I see. Well, seeing how you did follow protocol for once and extended this courtesy to me, I see no reason to deny your request. Permission granted. In fact, you may use the Great Hall for the ceremony and reception." Fuyutsuki and Shinji were both in a state of shock, but neither one showed it.  
“啊。”源堂应了一声，一种奇怪的感觉开始在他的身体里蔓延。失望？后悔？他不确定，但他并不喜欢这样。 “原来如此。好吧，看你这次确实遵守了礼节，向我表达了这种礼貌，我看不出有什么理由拒绝你的请求。许可了。事实上，你可以在大礼堂举行仪式和招待会。”冬月和真嗣都处于震惊之中，但谁也没有表现出来。

"Thank you, Commander," Shinji said as he pulled two wedding invitations from his flight suit and placed them before Gendo, who looked at them with disinterest. "It is planned for the Saturday after next. I'll inform Asuka of your offer, I know this will help greatly."  
“谢谢你，指挥官。”真嗣一边说，一边从飞行服中取出两张结婚请柬，放在源堂面前，而源堂却漠然地看着它们。 “计划是下周六。我会把你的提议通知明日香，我知道这会有很大帮助。”

"It…was my pleasure," his father replied, stunning the two others in the room once more. "Is there anything more, Captain?"  
“这是……我的荣幸，”他的父亲回答道，再次震惊了房间里的其他两个人。 “还有什么事情吗，队长？”

"No sir," Shinji replied as he saluted, spun on his heel and marched for the door before the Commander called back to him once more.  
“不，长官。”真嗣一边行礼一边回答，然后转身向门口走去，然后指挥官再次叫住了他。

"As your father, Shinji, I would have said 'yes', as well," Gendo said. Shinji was completely taken aback by his father's comment.  
“作为你的父亲真嗣，我也会说‘是’，”源堂说。真嗣被父亲的话彻底惊呆了。

"Thank…thank you, Father," Shinji stammered, completely in shock at what his father had just admitted. Gendo smiled slightly behind his hands as he watched his son leave the office.  
“谢谢……谢谢你，父亲。”真嗣结结巴巴地说，他对父亲刚刚承认的事情感到非常震惊。看着儿子离开办公室，源多双手背后轻轻一笑。

"Getting soft in your old age, Ikari?" Fuyutsuki chuckled, still in disbelief at his old student's behavior.  
“碇，你年纪大了，就变得软弱了吗？”冬月轻笑一声，仍然对自己老学生的行为感到难以置信。

"Hardly," Ikari replied as he pulled several memos from his desk and read them over before calling for his secretary to send the out. "Keeping the pilots relatively happy will help ensure the success of our scenario."  
“几乎没有，”碇回答道，他从办公桌上拿出几份备忘录，读了一遍，然后叫秘书将其发出。 “让飞行员相对满意将有助于确保我们的方案取得成功。”

"And the part about your answer, as a father?" the older gentleman prodded.  
“那关于你作为父亲的回答的部分呢？”老先生催促道。

"It was said to elicit a reaction from the Third Child. He has really come a long way, but has much further to go if a simple familial compliment is enough to shake him." Kozu cocked an eyebrow in response. "Besides, Yui would be proud of him."  
“据说这引起了老三的反应。他确实已经走了很长一段路，但如果一个简单的家庭赞美就足以动摇他，他还有很长的路要走。”科兹挑起一边眉毛回应道。 “此外，Yui也会为他感到骄傲。”

_"And perhaps,"_ Ikari thought to himself, _"deep down, I may be proud of him as well."_  
“也许，”碇心里想，“在内心深处，我也为他感到骄傲。”

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Thursday 周四_

"This is the place! I just know it!" Asuka exclaimed as she walked into the small store, located just on the outskirts of Tokyo-3.  
“就是这个地方！我就是知道！”明日香一边走进位于第三东京郊外的小店，一边惊呼道。

"Well, it pretty much has to be," Heidi replied as she stepped in behind the younger German, "It's the last music store between here and Tokyo-2." Her niece nodded as she looked around the shop.  
“嗯，这几乎是必然的，”海蒂走到年轻的德国人身后回答道，“这是这里和东京二号之间的最后一家音乐商店。”侄女环视店内，点点头。

"It's not that, it's just that something about this place just screams 'Shinji', you know," Asuka answered back. Heidi smirked. "What?"  
“不是那样的，只是这个地方有某种东西在尖叫着‘真嗣’，你知道，”明日香回答道。海蒂坏笑起来。 “什么？”

"I thought you were the one who was supposed to scream 'Shinji'!" Heidi teased as Asuka blushed from head to toe.  
“我以为你就是那个应该尖叫‘真嗣’的人！”海蒂调侃着，明日香从头到脚都红了。

"Aunt Heidi! That's not funny! We haven't …" Asuka fumed while Heidi held her hands up in a peace gesture.  
“海蒂阿姨！这不好笑！我们没有……”明日香生气了，海蒂举起双手做出和平的姿势。

"I know! I'm just teasing!" The older redhead said playfully, "Anyway, what were you saying?" Asuka huffed.  
“我知道！我就是开玩笑的！”红发老者俏皮地说道：“话说回来，你到底在说什么？”明日香哼了一声。

"I was going to say that this looks like the kind of place that idiot would spend time in," she finished as she started to look around in earnest.  
“我想说，这看起来像是白​​痴才会呆的地方。”她说完，开始认真地环顾四周。

"Asuka, don't call your fiancé an idiot," Heidi admonished as Asuka stepped forward to study the various instruments on display.  
“明日香，别说你的未婚夫是白痴。”海蒂告诫道，明日香走上前去研究展示的各种乐器。

"Well, he is! Sometimes…" Asuka replied as she found the string section of the store. She started to search frantically for something. "Ah! There they are!" Grabbing Heidi by the hand, she dragged her over to the display of cellos.  
“嗯，他是！有时……”明日香在找到商店的弦乐区时回答道。她开始疯狂地寻找着什么。 “啊！他们在那儿！”她拉着海蒂的手，把她拖到大提琴陈列架前。

"All men can be idiots, sometimes," came Heidi's amused answer. "And most women, too!" she added pointedly as she watched Asuka closely examining the cellos that were on display.  
“有时候，所有的男人都可能是白痴，”海蒂有趣地回答道。 “大多数女人也是如此！”当她看着明日香仔细检查展出的大提琴时，她尖锐地补充道。

"What does that mean?" her niece asked as she continued her examinations.  
“这意味着什么？”侄女一边继续检查一边问道。

"Well, let's see," Heidi began as she leaned against a counter and crossed her arms, "Just how long did you deny your feelings for Shinji? Even to the point of insulting and belittling him to hide your own feelings?" She watched Asuka's ears turn redder than her hair.  
“好吧，让我看看，”海蒂靠在柜台上，交叉双臂说道，“你否认自己对真嗣的感情到底有多久了？甚至到了侮辱、贬低他来掩饰自己感情的地步？”她看到明日香的耳朵变得比头发还红。

"I'm not proud of that," Asuka answered, as she gently replaced one cello and started examining another, "I don't do that any more, I hurt him so badly in the past."  
“我并不为此感到自豪，”明日香回答道，她轻轻地放回一把大提琴，开始检查另一把大提琴，“我不再这样做了，我过去深深地伤害了他。”

"I know, I was around for it last time," Heidi said soothingly, afraid a waterfall of tears would soon follow, "but even now, a little of the old attitude still slips through. The way you called him 'idiot' wasn't very nice. It's like you are still trying to hide from everyone, or distance yourself again." Asuka stopped her search and stood with her head hung low.  
“我知道，上次我就在这儿，”海蒂安慰道，生怕眼泪很快就会落下，“但即使是现在，旧的态度仍然有一点点消失。你叫他‘白痴’的方式并不是这样的。”这不太好，就像你还在试图躲避所有人，或者再次疏远自己。”明日香停止了搜索，低着头站着。

"I'm trying, I really am. It's just so hard, after spending most of my life trying to keep everyone out. I can't change overnight. I'm not that way around Shinji anymore, am I? I try to let the real me show when he's around, you know?" Heidi walked over and put an arm around the young woman. "That's why we're here, I gotta do this for him! He's given up so much for me, I have to show him how much he means to me!"  
“我正在努力，我真的很努力。这太难了，我花了大半辈子的时间试图将所有人拒之门外。我不可能在一夜之间改变。我不再像真嗣那样了，不是吗？我尝试着当他在身边时，让真实的我展现出来，你知道吗？”海蒂走过去，用手臂搂住年轻女子。 “这就是我们在这里的原因，我必须为他做这件事！他为我放弃了这么多，我必须向他展示他对我来说有多重要！”

"Asuka, he knows how much you love him, you don't have to go and get him something extravagant." the older woman said gently, but Asuka shook her head.  
“明日香，他知道你有多爱他，你不用去给他送什么奢侈的东西。”老妇人轻声说道，但明日香却摇了摇头。

"No, you don't understand, Auntie! The cello was his mother's, it's the only thing he had of her, and he gave it up for us!" Asuka cried as she rubbed her belly, like she was trying to draw strength from the small life growing inside. Heidi's eye's grew wide as Asuka turned once more and continued to search for several minutes more before turning back to her aunt, tears filling her eyes.  
“不，你不明白，阿姨！大提琴是他母亲的，这是他从她母亲那里得到的唯一的东西，他为了我们而放弃了它！”明日香一边哭一边揉着肚子，就像是想从肚子里生长的小生命中汲取力量。海蒂睁大了眼睛，明日香再次转过身，继续寻找了几分钟，然后才转向她的姨妈，眼里充满了泪水。

"It's not here," she dejectedly as tears threatened to pour from her eyes and down her cheeks. "This must not be the place." Heidi moved forward to comfort her niece once more, as the two of them turned to head back toward the door.  
“它不在这里，”她沮丧地说，泪水快要从她的眼睛里流下来，顺着脸颊流下来。 “这一定不是这个地方。”海蒂再次上前安抚侄女，两人转身朝门口走去。

"May I help you?" a rather bored voice called out from a doorway behind the front counter. Heidi turned to the speaker while Asuka wallowed in her misery. The speaker turned out to be a gentleman in his late 30's, sort of short and having an air of self-importance about him. His bored expression was very obvious.  
“我可以帮你吗？”柜台后面的门口传来一个相当无聊的声音。海蒂转向扬声器，而明日香则沉浸在痛苦之中。说话的人是一位三十多岁的绅士，身材矮小，有一种自以为是的感觉。他的无聊表情非常明显。

"Yes, you can," Heidi answered, grabbing Asuka by the hand and pulling her toward the counter. "Do you have anymore cellos in the back? My niece and I are looking for a very special one."  
“是的，你可以，”海蒂回答，抓住明日香的手，把她拉向柜台。 “后面还有大提琴吗？我和我的侄女正在寻找一把非常特别的大提琴。”

"Humph! There really isn't much of a demand for cellos," the speaker mused, "but we do have a few in the back."  
“哼！对大提琴的需求确实不多，”说话者若有所思地说，“但我们后面确实有一些。”

"Really?!" Asuka perked up as she rushed to the counter and slapped her hands down. "Can we see them, please?" she asked in her sweetest voice. The shopkeeper wasn't moved.  
“真的吗？！”明日香精神一振，冲到柜台前，拍了拍双手。 “我们可以见见他们吗？”她用最甜美的声音问道。店主不为所动。

"Unfortunately, they are quite large and difficult to get to. I wouldn't wish to damage any of them. I assure you, the ones on the sales floor are very good and will be adequate for your needs," he replied in a rather bored voice. Asuka and Heidi were stunned by his attitude, as a growl started to build in Asuka's throat.  
“不幸的是，它们很大而且很难到达。我不想损坏它们中的任何一个。我向你保证，销售区的那些都非常好，足以满足你的需求，”他在一封电子邮件中回答道。相当无聊的声音。明日香和海蒂被他的态度惊呆了，明日香的喉咙里开始发出咆哮。

"Please, sir, we're looking for a very specific one," Heidi stated as she placed a hand on Asuka's shoulder to keep her from doing anything rash. "Did a young man come in here several weeks ago and sell a cello to you?"  
“拜托，先生，我们正在寻找一个非常具体的人，”海蒂一边说，一边把手放在明日香的肩膀上，以防止她做出任何鲁莽的举动。 “几周前有一个年轻人来这里卖过一把大提琴给你吗？”

"Not to me," the clerk sniffed in a very self-important voice, "I was at a very important conference in Hokkaido until just a few days ago. Perhaps my father…." Without another word, he turned and went back through the doorway, only to return a moment later with a much older gentleman in tow.  
“对我来说不是，”店员用一种非常自以为是的声音吸了吸鼻子，“直到几天前，我还在北海道参加一个非常重要的会议。也许是我父亲……”他没有再说什么，转身从门口回去，片刻后又回来了，身后还跟着一位年长得多的绅士。

"How can I help you young ladies?" he croaked as Heidi blushed at being called 'young lady', Asuka stifled a giggle. Before Heidi could say anything, Asuka spoke up.  
“年轻的女士们，我能帮到你们什么吗？”当海蒂因被称为“年轻女士”而脸红时，他沙哑地叫道，明日香忍住咯咯笑。还没等海蒂说话，明日香就开口了。

"Please excuse us, sir, but we were wondering if a young man came in a few weeks back and sold a cello to you?" The older gentleman's eyes lit up as he thought back.  
“请原谅，先生，但我们想知道几周前是否有一个年轻人进来并卖了一把大提琴给您？”老先生回想起来，眼睛都亮了。

"Why, yes! There was! A very well mannered young man, to be sure," he said as he cast his eyes over to the other clerk for just a fraction of a second. "He wanted to sell his cello to raise money to by a ring for…how did he put it? Oh, yes, 'the most beautiful woman in the world.' That was it! Would that happen to be you, my dear?" Asuka blushed at what the old man had just said.  
“啊，是的！确实有！当然，是一个非常有礼貌的年轻人，”他一边说，一边把目光投向另一个店员，只看了一小会儿。 “他想卖掉他的大提琴，用一枚戒指筹集资金……他怎么说？哦，是的，‘世界上最美丽的女人’。”就是这样！亲爱的，那会是你吗？”明日香被老人的话弄得脸红了。

"Yes, she would be," Heidi replied since Asuka was too shocked and embarrassed to say anything, "May we see it, please?"  
“是的，她会的，”海蒂回答道，因为明日香太震惊了，又不好意思说什么，“我们可以看看吗？”

"Most certainly! Maka! Go fetch it from my office, at once! Be careful!" The young man scowled as he turned back to the back, mumbling to himself. "Please forgive me, but I must ask. Are you two sisters?" Once more, Heidi blushed.  
“当然！马卡！马上去我办公室拿！小心！”青年皱起眉头，转回身后，自言自语道。 “请原谅，但我必须问一下。你们是姐妹吗？”海蒂再一次脸红了。

"No sir, this is my Aunt, Heidi Zeppelin, and I'm Asuka Langley Soryu," Asuka introduced herself and her aunt, who was still too flustered to speak. The old man bowed deeply before he spoke.  
“不，先生，这是我的阿姨，海蒂·齐柏林，我是明日香·兰利·棣流，”明日香介绍自己和她的阿姨，她仍然慌乱得说不出话来。老者开口前深深鞠了一躬。

"I'm Honshu Takayamagi, and this is my son, Maka," the older gentleman said, motioning to his son who was gently placing the cello case on the counter. Asuka's heart skipped a beat as she recognized the letters 'I.Y.' stenciled in gold on the front of the case. Honshu opened the case reverently to reveal the work of art within.  
“我是本州高山城，这是我的儿子马卡，”这位年长的绅士说道，示意他的儿子轻轻地将大提琴盒放在柜台上。当明日香认出“I.Y.”这个字母时，她的心猛地一跳。表壳正面刻有金色图案。本州恭敬地打开箱子，展示里面的艺术品。

"Beautiful, is it not? The young man told me all about it's history. Did you know it is almost two centuries old, and had belonged to his mother before it was passed to him? After I purchased it from him, I examined it very closely and did some research. It was made by a very famous cello maker and is very, very rare indeed." Honshu's face beamed at the treasure he displayed for the two ladies. Maka's eyes glittered with greed.  
“很漂亮，不是吗？那个年轻人给我讲了它的历史。你知道吗，它已经有快两个世纪的历史了，在传给他之前，它是他母亲的？我从他那里买下来后，我检查了它。”它是由一位非常著名的大提琴制造商制作的，并且确实非常非常罕见。”看到他向两位女士展示的宝藏，本州脸上露出笑容。马卡的眼睛里闪烁着贪婪的光芒。

"May I see the back of it, please?" The young German asked, the excitement building within her. Honshu gently lifted the cello and turned it over, revealing a small scratch at the junction of the body and the neck. Asuka gasped.  
“我可以看看它的背面吗？”年轻的德国人问道，她内心兴奋不已。本州轻轻抬起大提琴，将其翻过来，露出琴身与琴颈交界处的一道细小划痕。明日香喘着气。

"That's it! That's Shinji's cello!" she exclaimed as a look of pure delight spread upon her face. Seeing the scratch confirmed it. Asuka had inadvertently caused it the summer before when one of her A10 clips fell from her head and struck the cello one day when Shinji was playing it. She had felt so bad when it happened, but Shinji just laughed it off.  
“就是它！那是真嗣的大提琴！”她惊呼道，脸上浮现出纯粹的喜悦之色。看到划痕证实了这一点。明日香是去年夏天无意中造成的，有一天，真嗣在演奏大提琴时，她的一个 A10 弹夹从头上掉落，砸到了大提琴。当这件事发生时，她感到非常难过，但真嗣只是一笑置之。

"How much do you want for it, Mr. Takayamagi?" Heidi sighed with relief as the past several days had been pure torture as they had went from music store to music store looking for the cello. Before the older man could reply, his son grabbed him and pulled him to the side. A heated argument ensued, before the younger Maka came back to the counter, a smile reminiscent of a shark's on his face. Heidi felt her heart drop before any word was said.  
“高山先生，您想要多少钱？”海蒂松了口气，这几天他们为了寻找大提琴，从一家音像店到另一家音像店，简直是一种折磨。老人还没来得及回答，儿子就抓住了他，把他拉到一边。一场激烈的争论随之而来，然后年轻的马卡回到柜台，脸上挂着让人想起鲨鱼的微笑。话还没说完，海蒂的心就沉了下去。

"You can have this lovely antique for a mere one hundred thousand," he said smoothly. Heidi and Asuka's jaws hit the floor, while Maka merely smiled. "Trust me, that is a bargain."  
“十万就可以拥有这件可爱的古董了。”他淡淡地说。海蒂和明日香的下巴都快掉到地上了，而玛卡只是微笑着。 “相信我，这很划算。”

"One hundred thousand?!" Asuka screamed, "Just how much did you give Shinji for it to begin with?!" Asuka knew there was no way she could afford to buy it back at that price.  
“十万？！”明日香尖叫道：“你到底给了真嗣多少钱？！”明日香知道她不可能以这个价格买回来。

"I gave him nine thousand for it, " Honshu replied as his son gave him a wicked look and waved for him to be silent.  
“我给了他九千块钱，”本州回答道，他的儿子恶狠狠地看了他一眼，挥手示意他安静。

"Yes, but that was before we discovered how rare and valuable it was," the younger Takayamagi sneered. Asuka could feel the rage building up inside of her.  
“是的，但那是在我们发现它有多么稀有和珍贵之前。”年轻的高山城冷笑道。明日香能感觉到她内心的愤怒正在积聚。

"What?! That's outrageous! The only reason he sold it was to help take care of us…err…me! It meant so much to him! Please, could you reconsider?" she managed to get out before stopping and gasping for air. Maka's smile grew even bigger.  
“什么？！这太离谱了！他卖掉它的唯一原因是为了帮助照顾我们……呃……我！这对他来说意义重大！拜托，你能重新考虑一下吗？”她设法逃了出来，然后停下来喘着气。玛卡的笑容更加灿烂了。

"My apologies, I didn't realize how important it was to you," he replied with false sincerity, "One hundred and fifty thousand."  
“抱歉，我没有意识到这对你来说有多重要，”他假装真诚地回答，“十五万。”

"How could you?!" Asuka screamed, tears pouring down her cheeks. "I…I wanted to get it back for him so I could give it to him as a wedding gift! Don't you have any heart at all?"  
“你怎么能？！”明日香尖叫起来，泪水从脸颊上流下来。 “我……我想把它拿回来，作为结婚礼物送给他！你就没有心吗？”

"Humph! You are too young to get married! If you want it, you'll pay my price! Trust me, I can find another buyer for it!" Maka barked as he placed the cello back in it's case, snapped the latches closed and stood back, arms crossed in defiance. "If this guy means so much to you, you'll pay me what I want! Now, either show me the cash, or get out of my store!" This was more than the older Takayamagi could take, as he picked up a set of drumsticks and proceeded to ricochet them off his son's head.  
“哼！你还太小，不适合结婚！你要的话，就出我的价钱！相信我，我一定能找到买家的！”马卡一边叫着，一边把大提琴放回琴盒，猛地关上门闩，向后退了一步，双臂交叉，充满挑衅。 “如果这个家伙对你来说很重要，你就付我我想要的钱！现在，要么给我看现金，要么滚出我的商店！”这超出了年长的高山城的承受能力，他拿起一套鸡腿，开始将它们从儿子的头上弹开。

"Now listen here," he hissed into his son's ear, which he had grabbed and pulled down to his lips, " this is still MY store, and you WILL NOT talk to my customers in such a disrespectful way! Now, get back there to the back and make yourself useful before I kick you out like your boyfriend in Hokkaido did! Out!" No sooner had Maka shuffled out of the room, his tail between his legs, than Honshu approached the two redheads as they turned to head out the door.  
“现在听着，”他对着儿子的耳朵嘶嘶地说，他抓住儿子的耳朵，将其拉到嘴唇上，“这仍然是我的商店，你不能以如此不尊重的方式与我的顾客说话！现在，回到那里到后面去，让自己变得有用，然后我就会像你在北海道的男朋友那样把你赶出去！”马卡夹着尾巴拖着脚步走出房间后，本州就走近了两个红发女郎，他们正转身走出门。

"Ladies, please wait," the old man said gently as he reached out and took Asuka's hand. Much to her own surprise, she didn't flinch or pull away. Something in the gentleman's touch was warm and comforting. As one, they turned back toward him.  
“女士们，请稍等。”老人温柔地说，伸出手握住明日香的手。令她自己惊讶的是，她没有退缩或退缩。绅士的触感让人感到温暖和安慰。他们合而为一地转身面向他。

"Please, I must apologize for my son's rudeness," he began as he gazed into Asuka's eyes. "Your young man, he must mean very much to you, yes?"  
“拜托，我必须为我儿子的无礼行为道歉，”他凝视着明日香的眼睛说道。 “你的年轻人，他对你一定很重要，是吗？”

"More than I can say," came Asuka's honest reply, as she wiped tears from her eyes. Honshu and Heidi smiled gently, as he produced a handkerchief and gave it Asuka to wipe her tears away.  
“我无法说。”明日香擦去眼中的泪水，诚实地回答道。本州和海蒂温柔地笑了，他拿出一块手帕递给明日香，让她擦眼泪。

"Is he the father?" he asked, causing Heidi's jaw to drop and Asuka to go deathly pale.  
“他是父亲吗？”他问道，让海蒂的下巴掉了下来，明日香的脸色变得惨白。

"How…how did…?" she stammered as the older man gently patted her hand.  
“怎么……怎么……？”当年长的男人轻轻拍着她的手时，她结结巴巴地说。

"Please, be calm," he reassured, "Young lady, I'm the father of nine children, of which only that fool Maka still lives with me. Trust me, I know the signs, I can see your glow." Asuka's color got a little better as the gentleman continued to comfort her.  
“请冷静一点，”他安慰道，“年轻的女士，我是九个孩子的父亲，其中只有玛卡那个傻瓜还和我住在一起。相信我，我知道这些迹象，我能看到你的光芒。”随着绅士的不断安慰，明日香的脸色才稍微好了一些。

"Yes, he is, " Asuka replied as Honshu lead her to a chair and had her sit down and relax. Honshu nodded his head sagely as he produced a cup of tea out of nowhere. Heidi shook her head at the older man's actions.  
“是的，他是，”明日香回答道，本州把她带到一把椅子上，让她坐下来放松。本州乖巧地点点头，随手泡了一杯茶。海蒂对老人的举动摇了摇头。

"There, you look like you're beginning to feel better now," he smiled as he pulled two other chairs out for he and Heidi to sit. "So, you are the one Mr. Ikari always spoke about. It is nice to finally meet you!"  
“好了，你看起来现在开始感觉好多了。”他微笑着拉出另外两把椅子让他和海蒂坐下。 “这么说，你就是碇先生经常挂在嘴边的那个人。很高兴终于见到你了！”

"You know Shinji?" Heidi asked as she looked at the older man warily. Honshu chuckled when he saw Asuka's eyes grow large, then cast a knowing smile at Heidi.  
“你认识慎二？”海蒂警惕地看着老者问道。看到明日香睁大的眼睛，本州笑了笑，然后对海蒂露出了会心的微笑。

"See, I told you this seemed like a place Shinji would shop!" Asuka gloated as she relaxed, feeling much better after her cup of tea.  
“看，我告诉过你这看起来像是真嗣购物的地方！”明日香幸灾乐祸地放松下来，喝完茶后感觉好多了。

"Yes, your young man has been shopping here for years, always getting music for his cello, or ordering classical music on SDAT. I'm one of the few places that still carry that format. Everyone else seems to have gone to MP3's. He even bought a bow right around last Christmas. However, it wasn't for a cello, but for a violin." Honshu smiled as he thought about one of his best customers.  
“是的，你的年轻人多年来一直在这里购物，总是为他的大提琴购买音乐，或者在 SDAT 上订购古典音乐。我是少数仍然保留这种格式的地方之一。其他人似乎都去了 MP3。他甚至在去年圣诞节前后买了一把弓，但这不是大提琴，而是小提琴。”当他想到他最好的客户之一时，本州笑了。

"_So this is where he got it"_ Asuka mused, thinking back to when she had shattered her old bow in a fit of rage. Shinji had wrapped up the new one and gave it to her for Christmas. Something about that memory puzzled her, but she couldn't put her finger on it.  
“所以他就是从这里得到的，”明日香沉思道，回想起她在盛怒之下打碎旧弓的情景。真嗣已经把新的包裹起来送给她作为圣诞节礼物。这段记忆让她有些困惑，但又说不出来。

"Now, about the cello," Honshu began, causing Asuka and Heidi to cringe, "As much as I would love to give it to you two as a wedding gift, I fear that I cannot. Taking a loss like that would damage my business beyond the point of repair."  
“现在，关于大提琴，”本州开始说，让明日香和海蒂感到畏缩，“尽管我很想把它作为结婚礼物送给你们两个，但我担心我不能。承受这样的损失会损害我的业务超出了修复范围。”

"I…I understand, Mr. Takayamagi," Asuka replied sadly, eyes downcast. It would have broken the old man's heart, if he hadn't already had something up his sleeve. "I hope you will be able to find someone to buy it that enjoys it as much as I have."  
“我……我明白了，高山城先生。”明日香眼神低垂，悲伤地回答道。要不是老人已经有什么心计，他一定会心碎的。 “我希望你能找到像我一样喜欢它的人来买它。”

"Ah, yes, I already have," he smiled as he reached over and patted Asuka's hand once more. He caught Heidi's eye and gave her a quick wink. "Would ten thousand be within your budget? That would cover my cost plus a small profit, so I don't have to hear my son griping too much."  
“啊，是的，我已经这么做了。”他微笑着伸出手，再次拍拍明日香的手。他与海蒂目光对视，快速地对她眨了眨眼。 “一万在你的预算之内吗？这样就可以支付我的成本，再加上一点点利润，这样我就不用听我儿子抱怨太多了。”

"Uh…yeah, we can do that!" Asuka stammered, utterly dumbfounded at the price. After hearing how valuable the cello was, she was resigned to never seeing it again. "Thank you, Mr. Takayamagi!" With that, she did something very un-Asuka like, she gave the old man a hug, much to his delight. After the exchange of money, Honshu helped load the cello very gingerly in the back of Misato's car.  
“呃……是的，我们可以做到！”明日香结结巴巴，对这个价格彻底傻眼了。在听说大提琴有多值钱后，她再也见不到它了。 「谢谢你，高山先生！」说完，她做了一件非常不像明日香的事情，她给了老人一个拥抱，这让他很高兴。兑换完钱后，本州小心翼翼地帮忙把大提琴装进美里的车后座。

"Now remember, don't tell Shinji about it!" Asuka said from the car as she and Heidi prepared to leave. She reached out and handed Honshu an envelope. Realizing what it was, he bowed deeply.  
“记住，这件事不要告诉真嗣！”明日香在车上说道，她和海蒂准备离开。她伸出手，递给本州一个信封。意识到那是什么后，他深深地鞠了一躬。

"I wouldn't think of it, sweet lady! And thank you!" he said as they pulled away. With a smile still on his face, he turned back to his shop and prepared to set his son straight on just who runs the store.  
“我没想到，亲爱的女士！谢谢你！”当他们离开时，他说道。他脸上仍挂着微笑，转身回到自己的店里，准备向儿子直言不讳地指责这家店的老板。

_Friday 星期五_

"Lieutenant Aoba?" Shinji asked as he stood by the table in the NERV cafeteria. Shigeru looked up and his good mood vanished in an instant, as his face became a mask to conceal his emotions.  
“青叶中尉？”真嗣站在NERV食堂的桌边问道。茂抬起头来，原本的好心情瞬间消失殆尽，他的脸变成了面具，掩饰着自己的情绪。

"What can I do for you, Captain?" Shigeru asked in the most neutral tone he could muster. He was still very angry over what had happened on the Bridge several days back.  
“我能为您做点什么吗，队长？”茂用他所能调出的最中性的语气问道。对于几天前在大桥上发生的事情，他仍然很生气。

"May I sit?" Shinji asked nervously, waiting for the older man to respond. Shinji felt he had something very important to do, and had put it off as long as he could.  
“我可以坐吗？”真嗣紧张地问道，等待着年长者的回应。真嗣觉得自己有一件非常重要的事情要做，所以尽可能地推迟了。

"You outrank me, _sir_, you don't have to ask permission." Shigeru replied, still staring down into his tray. He had suddenly lost his appetite.  
“你的级别比我高，先生，你不需要征求许可。” Shigeru 回答道，仍然低头盯着托盘。他突然没了胃口。

"It's the polite thing to do," Shinji answered as he continued to stand. Shigeru's head snapped up at the reply, a look of bewilderment upon his face. Realizing that Shinji wouldn't move until he was invited, Shigeru shook his head and waved to the seat just across from him. Shinji sighed as he took the offered seat. "Thanks."  
“这是礼貌的做法。”真嗣一边回答一边继续站着。听到这个回答，志贺猛地抬起头，脸上露出了困惑的表情。茂意识到真嗣在被邀请之前不会动，他摇摇头，向对面的座位挥了挥手。真嗣叹了口气，坐到了座位上。 “谢谢。”

"Like I said, what can I do for you, Captain?" Shigeru asked once more as he saw Shinji just sitting there, obviously very uncomfortable.  
“就像我说的，队长，我能为您做点什么吗？”茂看到真嗣坐在那里，显然很不舒服，再次问道。

"Please, just call me 'Shinji' ," the younger man stammered, at which Shigeru shook his head violently.  
“请叫我‘真嗣’吧。”年轻人结结巴巴地说，茂猛烈地摇了摇头。

"Sorry, sir, no can do! You outrank me, and are my commanding officer, so such familiarity would be inappropriate!" Shigeru spat out, trying to keep his anger in check, "I wouldn't want to jeopardize my career in that fashion."  
“抱歉，先生，不行！你的军衔比我高，又是我的指挥官，这么熟悉不太合适！” Shigeru 吐了出来，试图控制自己的愤怒，“我不想以这种方式危及我的职业生涯。”

"Okay," Shinji sighed, looking down to the table top before looking back up once more to look Shigeru in the eye, "Well, I just came by to say…I want to apologize for the other day. I didn't mean to come off so harsh, and I really didn't mean to come down so hard on you, Lieutenant." Shigeru's eyes bulged as his jaw hit the table. He just shook his head.  
“好吧，”真嗣叹了口气，低头看着桌面，然后再次抬头看着茂的眼睛，“好吧，我只是过来说……我想为那天的事情道歉。我不是故意的。”表现得如此严厉，我真的不是故意对你如此严厉，中尉。”茂的下巴撞到了桌子，眼睛瞪得大大的。他只是摇了摇头。

"You don't have to apologize, you are my superior officer and…" Shigeru said, shocked by what Shinji was saying, confusion running rampant within his mind when the young man interrupted him.  
“你不用道歉，你是我的上级，而且……”茂说道，他对真嗣的话感到震惊，当年轻人打断他时，他的脑海里一片混乱。

"Lieutenant Aoba, I'm sorry," Shinji said softly as he continued to look at the table. Shigeru's shock continued to leave him stunned for several seconds before anger welled back up and was released.  
“青叶中尉，对不起。”真嗣继续看着桌子，轻声说道。茂的震惊让他愣了好几秒，然后怒火又涌了上来，被释放了出来。

"Shinji, just what the hell happened to you?!" the older man whispered to keep everyone else within the cafeteria from turning toward the pair. "I mean, one day you come in and you're the nice quiet guy you usually are, and the next day you're Captain Hardass! Man, that just doesn't make any sense! What the hell is the thing with the forced DNA testing? What the hell is going on around here?" Shinji sighed once more before looking Shigeru square in the eye  
“慎二，你到底怎么了？！”年长的男人低声说道，阻止自助餐厅里的其他人转向这两个人。 “我的意思是，有一天你进来时，你是一个平时很安静的好人，第二天你就成了哈达斯队长！伙计，这根本没有任何意义！这到底是怎么回事？强制DNA检测？这到底是怎么回事？”真嗣再次叹了口气，直视着茂的眼睛

"Do you remember the Commander saying something about Asuka, and about something happening to her?" Shinji reminded him, as the fire started to blaze within his eyes once more. Shigeru shivered slightly at the sight. "Has anyone told you what has happened?"  
“你还记得指挥官说过一些关于明日香的事，以及她身上发生的事情吗？”真嗣提醒道，眼中再次燃起了火焰。茂看着这一幕，微微颤抖起来。 “有没有人告诉你发生了什么事？”

"I remember. There are rumors going around about her, and you, but nothing concrete," the long haired man said softly, like he was afraid to be caught listening to rumors.  
“我记得，有关于她和你的谣言，但没有具体的。”长发男人轻声说道，像是生怕被人发现听信谣言一样。

"What have you heard?"" asked Shinji, the fire still ablaze within his blue eyes. Thinking about what had happened to his love continued to anger him, and the thought of what kind of rumors were going around was beginning to trouble him greatly.  
“你听到了什么？”真嗣问道，他的蓝眼睛里仍然燃烧着火焰。想到他的爱人所发生的事情继续让他愤怒，而想到周围有什么样的谣言开始让他烦恼不已。

"Well, the biggest one we've heard so far is that the two of you are getting married, and that is was forced by the Commander as some sort experiment," Shigeru said, looking around somewhat, " One said that the Second Child is sick, and the tests are to look for organ donors of some sort. Some even say that they are going to use our DNA to fertilize eggs donated by Asuka to create an army of some sort. Silly shit like that. No one really knows what is going on." Shinji's face took on a bemused look at what he had just heard, then became deathly serious. "I think that someone beat the hell out of her and left some DNA evidence behind, and they are going to use a dragnet to catch them."  
“嗯，目前为止我们听到的最大的消息就是你们两个要结婚了，那是指挥官强迫的，作为某种实验，”茂说道，环顾四周，“有人说老二生病了，而这些测试是为了寻找某种器官捐赠者，有些人甚至说他们将使用我们的 DNA 使明日香捐赠的卵子受精，以创建某种愚蠢的军队。到底是怎么回事。”真嗣听到刚才的话，脸上露出了困惑的表情，然后变得死一般严肃。 “我认为有人把她打得落花流水，并留下了一些DNA证据，他们会用天罗地网来抓捕他们。”

"The first rumor is half true, Asuka and I are getting married, but my father has nothing to do with it," Shinji said softly, yet in a powerful voice, "Asuka's pregnant."  
“第一个谣言有一半是真的，我和明日香要结婚了，但这与我父亲无关，”真嗣轻声说道，但声音有力，“明日香怀孕了。”

"WHAT?!" Shigeru yelped, before quieting down once more as several heads turned back to their direction. "Dude, you and Asuka are having a kid? Man, you got more balls than I gave you credit for! Uh…oh…wait a second…"  
“什么？！”茂尖叫了一声，然后随着几个头转回他们的方向而再次安静下来。 “伙计，你和明日香要生孩子了？伙计，你的蛋蛋比我想象的还要多！呃……哦……等一下……”

"Now I think you understand," Shinji said through clenched teeth, seeing the color drain from Shigeru's face, "Unfortunately, I'm not the biological father. We don't know who the father is, thus the DNA testing."  
“现在我想你明白了，”真嗣看着茂的脸色渐渐褪色，咬紧牙关说道，“不幸的是，我不是亲生父亲。我们不知道父亲是谁，因此DNA测试也不知道。”

"Oh man," Shigeru stammered, "was she raped? Man, I am so sorry, Shinji!"  
“噢，天啊，”茂结结巴巴地说，“她被强奸了吗？天啊，真嗣，我很抱歉！”

"We don't know right now. Asuka doesn't remember anything about it, whatsoever. It happened sometime around Misato's Christmas party, so we're going with the theory that someone took advantage of her during the celebration.," Shinji said sadly, his chest hurting at the thought of his lady being hurt so badly. "We didn't know anything happened until she went to the doctor a month ago, and they gave her the news."  
“我们现在不知道。无论如何，明日香不记得任何事情。这件事发生在美里的圣诞晚会前后，所以我们认为有人在庆祝活动中利用了她。”真嗣说。可悲的是，一想到他的女人受到如此严重的伤害，他的胸口就痛。 “直到一个月前她去看医生，我们才知道发生了什么事，他们告诉了她这个消息。”

"That explains why you got so riled up! You always had it bad for that girl," Shigeru said, drawing a look from Shinji. "Come on, man, there was no way in the world you could hide it!" Shinji grinned a bit before responding.  
“这就解释了为什么你这么生气！你总是对那个女孩不好，”茂说道，从真嗣身上看了一眼。 “得了吧，伙计，你根本就没有办法隐藏它！”真嗣微微一笑，才回答道。

"Yeah, I guess so!," Shinji said wryly as he shook his head. "Amazing how everyone but the two of us saw it !" This drew a chuckle from the older man.  
“是啊，我想是的！”真嗣苦笑着摇摇头。 “令人惊讶的是，除了我们两个之外，每个人都看到了它！”这话引来了老者的笑声。

"We knew she had a thing for you, as well. Shoot, we even had a pool going to see how long it would be before you two finally admitted it and started going out! I need to check on the pool and see who won," he said, laughing it up. Shinji's face turned red, but covered it up quickly.  
“我们知道她也喜欢你。天啊，我们甚至还准备了一个泳池，看看你们两个要花多长时间才能最终承认并开始出去！我需要检查一下泳池，看看谁赢了，”他笑着说道。真嗣的脸涨得通红，但很快就掩盖了。

"Just remember, I want a cut of the pot, seeing how I'm the one who just provided the answer to the question!" Shinji laughed as he stood to leave, before Shigeru spoke up.  
“记住，我想要分一杯羹，看看我是刚刚提供问题答案的人！”真嗣笑着起身离开，茂却开口说道。

"I appreciate the apology, Shinji," Shigeru said as he looked up to the younger man, "I understand why you were upset. Just don't think it's going to make me take it easy on you, though." Shinji cocked his head somewhat, a questioning look on his face.  
“我很感激你的道歉，真嗣，”茂说道，他抬头看着年轻人，“我理解你为什么不高兴。不过，别以为这会让我对你掉以轻心。”真嗣微微侧过头，脸上露出询问的神色。

"You didn't get the memo?" Shigeru asked the bewildered Captain, who just shook his head. "That's weird, I gave it to Major Katsuragi's assistant to give to you yesterday. Well, the Commander has ordered me to start your physical training as soon as school is out. Trust me, I'm gonna put you through the wringer! I'm not going to allow anyone to outrank me who can't kick my ass, if I have anything to say about it!" he smiled at the look on Shinji's face, as the younger man went pale at the idea.  
“你没有收到备忘录吗？”茂向一脸困惑的队长问道，队长只是摇了摇头。 “奇怪了，我昨天就交给葛城少佐的助手给你了。好吧，指挥官命令我一放学就开始你的体能训练。相信我，我会让你受苦受难的！我如果我有什么话要说的话，我不会允许任何不能踢我屁股的人超越我！”他对着真嗣脸上的表情微笑起来，而年轻人因为这个想法脸色变得苍白。

"I wonder why the hell the Old Man came up with that?" Shinji mused, his eyebrows furrowing in thought.  
“我想知道老夫到底为什么想出这个办法？”真嗣皱起眉头若有所思。

"Don't know, something about helping you carry out your duties. I'll see what I can do about getting you copy…" Shigeru added before being interrupted by a young female voice.  
“不知道，关于帮助你履行职责的事情。我会看看我能做些什么来给你拿到副本……”茂补充道，然后被一个年轻的女声打断。

"Captain! Captain Ikari!" Mariko Toranaga called out as she practically skipped toward Shinji with several files in her hand. The smile on her face was one of utter delight.  
「队长！碇队长！」虎永麻里子大叫一声，手里拿着几份文件，几乎是跳向真嗣的。她脸上的笑容是一种完全的喜悦。

"Oh, hello Mariko," Shinji said as Shigeru's jaw dropped at the sight of the young lady, "What can I do for you?"  
“哦，你好真理子，”真嗣说道，茂看到这位年轻女士时下巴都掉了下来，“有什么可以帮到你的吗？”

"_I know what I'd like to do for her,_" Shigeru thought as he gazed up at the raven haired beauty, who continued to ignore him for Shinji.  
“我知道我想为她做什么，”茂抬头看着黑发美女，而她却继续为了真嗣而无视他。

"I just came by to let you know…uh," she said as her face fell a bit as she looked at Shinji and Shigeru by the table, "did I interrupt your dinner or anything?" Shinji was puzzled by her behavior.  
“我过来只是想让你们知道……呃，”她看着桌边的真嗣和茂，脸色沉了下来，“我是不是打扰你们吃饭了？”真嗣对她的行为感到困惑。

"Huh? Oh, no, the Lieutenant and I were just talking," Shinji said as she took another step forward and gazed up into Shinji's eyes, her expression brightening once more. "Uh…have you two met? Mariko Toranaga, this is Lieutenant Shigeru Aoba. Shigeru, this is Mariko, Major Katsuragi's assistant."  
“嗯？哦，不，中尉和我只是在说话。”真嗣说道，她又向前迈出了一步，抬头看着真嗣的眼睛，她的表情再次变得明亮起来。 “呃……你们两个见过面吗？虎永真理子，这是青叶茂中尉。茂，这是葛城少校的助手真理子。”

"Pleased to meet you, Mariko," Shigeru stood up as Shinji took a discreet step back while Mariko's head was turned. Mariko gave Shigeru a look like he was something she just scraped off her shoe.  
“很高兴见到你，真理子。”茂站了起来，真嗣小心翼翼地后退了一步，真理子也转过头。真理子用一种眼神看着茂，就好像他是她刚从鞋子上刮下来的东西一样。

"Huh? Oh. Hello," she said indifferently as she turned back to face Shinji once more, becoming all bubbly once more.  
“嗯？哦。哈喽。”她冷漠地说，再次转身面对真嗣，再次变得热情洋溢。

"_Ouch,_" Shigeru thought sadly as he sat back down at the table, _"That was cold!"_  
“哎哟，”茂坐回桌边，悲伤地想，“好冷啊！”

" So, have you eaten dinner yet, Captain?" the young girl asked as she stepped toward Shinji once more. Shinji went a little pale and wished he had an AT field he could erect at that instant.  
“那么，队长，你吃晚饭了吗？”少女再次走向真嗣，问道。真嗣的脸色有些苍白，他希望自己能在那一刻建立一个AT领域。

"Uh, not yet. I probably will when I get home. So, what did you need?" he asked, hoping she would get to the point. He was looking forward to getting home and spending some time with Asuka. He was wanting to do something special for her tomorrow before they got bogged down with wedding plans for the rest of the weekend.  
“呃，还没有。我回家后可能会的。那么，你需要什么？”他问道，希望她能切入主题。他期待着回家并与明日香共度时光。他想明天为她做一些特别的事情，然后他们才能在周末剩下的时间里陷入婚礼计划。

"Oh, I just came by to tell you I left some files on your desk you need to look at before you go home! So, got any plans for the weekend?" she asked while she batted her eyelashes at him. Shigeru just rolled his eyes and cursed his luck.  
“哦，我只是过来告诉你我在你的桌子上留了一些文件，你回家之前需要看一下！那么，周末有什么计划吗？”她一边向他眨着睫毛一边问道。 Shigeru 只是翻了个白眼，咒骂着自己的运气。

"Yeah," Shinji answered slowly, trying to keep his face a neutral as possible, "I planning on spending sometime with my family." Mariko's face fell slightly. "Lieutenant Aoba, got any plans for the weekend?"  
“是的，”真嗣缓慢地回答，尽量保持表情平静，“我打算和家人一起度过一段时间。”真理子的脸色微微沉了下来。 “青叶中尉，周末有什么安排吗？”

"Nope, not a one, Captain!" Shigeru piped up as he stood once more, a silly grin on his face.  
“不，不是一个，队长！”石浩再次站起身来，脸上挂着傻乎乎的笑容。

"Oh. That's nice," Mariko said rather coolly back to the long-haired man, then turned back to Shinji. "Well, have fun on your weekend, Captain!" she perked up again as she waltzed off, the spring in her step not quite as pronounced as before. Shigeru stared back after her before turning his attention back to Shinji.  
“哦。那太好了，”真理子相当冷静地对长发男人说道，然后又转向真嗣。 “嗯，队长，周末愉快！”当她跳起华尔兹舞时，她又精神抖擞，步伐不再像以前那么轻快了。茂回头看了她一眼，然后又把注意力转向真嗣。

"What the hell was that about?" Shinji asked as he shook his head in confusion. Shigeru's jaw dropped at the tone in Shinji's voice.  
“那到底是怎么回事？”真嗣疑惑地摇摇头问道。真嗣的语气让茂惊得下巴都掉下来了。

"Damn dude, I didn't think you were that dense!" Shigeru said as he sat back down and picked up his tea and began to drink it, "That girl was so totally flirting with you! Damn!" he muttered as shook his head once more. "Marrying a hot-as-hell redhead, and being chased by a really cute chick at work! Some guys have all the luck!"  
“臭小子，没想到你这么脑残啊！”茂一边坐下，一边端起茶喝起来，说道：“那丫头简直就是在跟你调情啊！妈的！”他嘟囔着，再次摇了摇头。 “娶了一个火辣辣的红发女郎，在工作中又被一个非常可爱的小妞追！有些男人真是太幸运了！”

"I think you're imagining things, man," Shinji said off-handedly. "She's just happy I saved her job." Despite what Shigeru thought, Shinji wasn't that dense. He knew what Mariko was doing and it was troubling him to no end. He didn't want to hurt her, but he had no feelings for her at whatsoever.  
“我认为你在想象一些事情，伙计，”真嗣随口说道。 “她很高兴我保住了她的工作。”不管茂怎么想，真嗣并没有那么笨。他知道真理子在做什么，这让他烦恼不已。他不想伤害她，但他对她没有任何感情。

"Whatever, dude," the older man mumbled as he stared at his tea.  
“不管怎样，伙计，”年长的男人盯着茶水，咕哝道。

"So, are we good, Lieutenant?" Shinji asked sincerely. He really hated getting on people's bad sides and leaving things unsaid. Shigeru just grunted and looked up to Shinji with a wry half grin.  
“那么，中尉，我们好吗？”慎二诚恳地问道。他真的很讨厌得罪别人并且不说出来。茂只是咕哝了一声，抬头看着真嗣，苦笑着。

"Yeah, we're good, Shinji," Shigeru replied as he looked at the young pilot in a new light. _"After all, how many guys would do what he's planning on doing?"_ he thought, feeling just a little shamed at his reaction to the previous events.  
“是的，我们很好，真嗣，”茂回答道，他用新的眼光看着这位年轻的飞行员。 “毕竟，有多少人会做他计划做的事情呢？”他想，对自己对之前事件的反应感到有点羞愧。

After waving good-bye to Shigeru, Shinji walked to his office and saw sitting upon his desk a large bento box. Grunting, he shook his head as he reached for the note sitting on top, hoping that it wasn't from who he was afraid it was.  
向茂挥手告别后，真嗣走进办公室，看到办公桌上放着一个大便当盒。他咕哝着摇摇头，伸手去拿上面的纸条，希望这不是他所担心的人写的。

_"Dear Shinji,"_ it read in a flowing script, _" I made this for you to help thank you for everything you have done for me. I hope you enjoy it, and think of me while you eat. If there is anything that you need or want to talk about, feel free to call me any time! Thanks! Mariko."_  
“亲爱的真嗣，”上面用流畅的字体写道，“我为你做这个是为了感谢你为我所做的一切。我希望你喜欢它，并在吃饭的时候想起我。如果有什么你可以做的有需要或想谈谈，请随时给我打电话，谢谢！”

"Damn," Shinji muttered to himself as he sat at his desk, staring at the meal in front of him. _" Well, that explains why she wanted to know if I had eaten dinner. That was nice of her,"_ he thought, _" but this is a little inappropriate. I don't want to hurt her feelings, but I don't want this to go any further than it already has!"_  
“该死。”真嗣坐在办公桌前，盯着面前的饭菜，自言自语道。 “好吧，这就解释了为什么她想知道我是否吃过晚饭。她真是太好了，”他想，“但这有点不合适。我不想伤害她的感情，但我不想这将比现在更进一步！”

With that last thought, he picked up the bento and emptied it's contents into the trash can before sitting it in the corner of his office to return to her later. He picked up the reports Mariko had placed on his desk under the bento and read through them quickly, discovering the missing memo Shigeru had spoken of earlier. Sure enough, his father had ordered him to begin physical training as soon as school ends for summer break.  
带着最后的念头，他拿起便当，把里面的东西倒进垃圾桶，然后把它放在办公室的角落里，等一会儿再还给她。他拿起麻里子放在桌上便当下面的报告，快速浏览起来，发现了茂刚才提到的丢失的备忘录。果然，父亲吩咐他一放暑假就开始体能训练。

"Figures," he said to himself before picking up an envelope that was under everything else Mariko had placed on his desk. Sighing, he ripped it open and was ready for another letter from the love-struck girl when he stopped. He recognized the sloppy kanji on the page. It was Asuka's handwriting.  
“数字。”他自言自语地说，然后拿起一个信封，信封位于真理子放在他桌子上的所有东西下面。叹了口气，他把信撕开，准备好再收到这位陷入爱情的女孩的来信，这时他停了下来。他认出了页面上的潦草汉字。这是明日香的笔迹。

"_Hey Shinji,"_ the note read, _" Guess who? Do me a favor and look in your desk drawer!"_ A smile crept over Shinji's face as he thought about his lady.  
“嘿，真嗣，”纸条上写着，“猜猜是谁？帮我一个忙，看看你的办公桌抽屉！”当他想到他的女士时，真嗣的脸上浮现出微笑。

" _I wonder what she's up to?"_ he pondered as he pulled open the top most drawer of his desk and found another envelope. _"I didn't even know she was coming to headquarters today. I wonder why she didn't stop to say 'hello'?"_ Opening the envelope, he broke out in a laugh as he read it's contents.  
“我想知道她在做什么？”他一边沉思，一边拉开办公桌最上面的抽屉，发现了另一个信封。 “我都不知道她今天要来总部。我不知道她为什么不停下来打个招呼？”打开信封，看到里面的内容，他笑了起来。

"_Other drawer, silly!"_ it read as Shinji got himself under control long enough to open the larger drawer in his desk. Inside was yet another envelope, along with a small white box with a red bow on top.  
“另一个抽屉，傻瓜！”当真嗣控制住自己并打开办公桌上较大的抽屉时，上面写着。里面还有另一个信封，还有一个白色小盒子，上面有一个红色蝴蝶结。

"_Well, you made it!"_ it said as the young Captain just shook his head and smiled, "_I just wrote to tell you how much I love you and how much I miss you! Hurry up and come home! Your future wife and child await to give you giant sized hugs and kisses when you come in! Heidi and I are making a special dinner tonight, so hurry up and come home! I left a little something for you in the box! Enjoy! Love, Asuka."_  
“嗯，你成功了！”年轻的船长只是摇头微笑着说道：“我写信只是想告诉你，我有多么爱你，有多么想念你！快点回家吧！你未来的妻子和孩子正等着给你一个大大的拥抱。”今晚我和海蒂准备了一顿特别的晚餐，所以快点回家吧，我在盒子里留了一些东西，好好享受吧！”

Shinji chuckled and felt his heart swell as he read the note. Lifting the lid from the box, he looked inside and saw a new SDAT player, along with a few classical tapes inside he had been eyeing recently at his favorite music store. He pulled it out and admired it, until something else inside made him put it down and stop still.  
真嗣笑了，读着纸条，他的心在膨胀。打开盒子的盖子，他往里面一看，看到了一台新的 SDAT 播放器，里面还有几盘他最近在他最喜欢的音乐商店看中的古典磁带。他把它拿出来欣赏，直到里面的其他东西让他把它放下并停下来。

With trembling hands, he reached inside and pulled out a flat piece of paper. The paper was a three-dimensional ultrasound image of a tiny little baby. A single tear slid down Shinji's cheek as he read the words written on the bottom of the photo.  
他颤抖着双手，伸手进去，拿出一张扁平的纸。这张纸是一个小婴儿的三维超声波图像。当真嗣读到照片底部的文字时，一滴泪水从他的脸颊上滑落。

_" Here's our baby, Shinji! Say 'hi' to your Daddy, little one!"  
“这是我们的孩子，真嗣！小家伙，向你的爸爸问好！”_

A lump formed in Shinji's throat as he smiled and gently touched the small face in the photo. Carefully folding the photo, he pulled is wallet out and placed it inside, then returned his wallet to his flight suit. Packing up the notes, tapes and player up in the box, he quickly left his office, pulled the door closed, and walked down the hall as fast as possible. He had a dinner with his family waiting, and nothing was going to slow him down.  
真嗣的喉咙里哽住了，他微笑着轻轻抚摸照片中的小脸。他小心翼翼地折叠照片，掏出钱包放进去，然后把钱包放回飞行服里。他把笔记、磁带和播放器装进盒子里，迅速离开办公室，关上门，以最快的速度沿着走廊走去。他和家人一起吃晚饭，没有什么可以阻止他。

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Friday Evening. 星期五晚上。_

"I'm home…OOOF!!" Shinji said as he walked into the apartment and was immediately attacked by a red-headed missile, who proceeded to wrap him up in a killer hug.  
“我回来了……噢！！”真嗣说道，当他走进公寓时，立即遭到了一枚红头导弹的攻击，并用致命的拥抱将他包裹起来。

"Hi!" Asuka said sweetly as she gazed up into his steel blue eyes. A smile spread itself over Shinji's face as his heart warmed at her touch.  
“你好！”明日香抬头看着他钢铁般的蓝色眼睛，甜甜地说道。真嗣的脸上绽开了笑容，他的心因她的触摸而温暖起来。

"Hi yourself!" he replied as he bent his head down and gave her a quick kiss. She melted at the touch of his lips.  
“你好！”他回答道，低下头，快速地吻了她一下。她在他嘴唇的触碰下融化了。

"Missed you," she said as she increased the strength of the hug. All Shinji could do was laugh.  
“想你。”她一边说，一边加大了拥抱的力度。真嗣所能做的就是笑。

"I would have never guessed!" he chuckled as she playfully slapped his arm, "I missed you, too!" With that, he gave her yet another kiss, this one deep, long, and toe-curling. Asuka felt like she had just turned into a large ball of putty, ready to be shaped into whatever Shinji desired. All Shinji desired was her.  
“我万万没想到！”当她戏谑地拍着他的手臂时，他笑了，“我也想你！”说完，他又给了她一个吻，这个吻又深又长，而且让脚趾卷曲。明日香感觉自己刚刚变成了一个大油灰球，准备被塑造成真嗣想要的任何形状。真嗣想要的就是她。

"All right, you two! Break it up! I don't think the air-conditioning can take the strain of keeping this place cool at this rate!" Misato ordered teasingly as she walked through with her cup of tea and went to sit in the living room, a rather silly grin plastered on her face.  
“好吧，你们两个！分手吧！我认为空调无法承受以这种速度保持这个地方凉爽的压力！”美里调侃地吩咐道，端着茶走了过去，坐在客厅里，脸上挂着一抹傻乎乎的笑容。

"Meanie!" Asuka shot back as she stuck her tongue out at her guardian before turning back to Shinji. "So! Ya like the present?" she asked, smiling warmly at her fiancé.  
“梅尼！”明日香向监护人吐了吐舌头，然后转身面向真嗣。 “那么！你喜欢这个礼物吗？”她问，对她的未婚夫热情地微笑。

"Yes, I did! Thank you!" Shinji replied, "Which reminds me…" With that he fell to his knees and wrapped his arms around Asuka's waist and placed his cheek to her belly.  
“是的，我做到了！谢谢你！”真嗣回答道：“这让我想起了……”说完，他跪倒在地，用双臂搂住明日香的腰，把脸颊贴在她的肚子上。

"Thank you, too, little one," he whispered as he snuggled to the belly, " Daddy loves you, you know that?" Asuka's eyes started to tear up as she ran her fingers through his hair, holding him close.  
“也谢谢你，小宝贝，”他依偎在肚子上，低声说道，“爸爸爱你，你知道吗？”当明日香用手指梳理他的头发，紧紧抱住他时，她的眼睛开始流泪。

"Aww, isn't that cute?" Heidi's voice called out as she watched the young couple from the kitchen where she and Asuka had been making dinner. The two of them had retreated to the kitchen as soon as they had come home from the doctor's office and the grocery store that day. "I thought you had already proposed, Shinji? Why are you on your knees?"  
“哇哦，这不是很可爱吗？”当海蒂在厨房里看着这对年轻夫妇时，她的声音响起，她和明日香正在厨房里做晚饭。那天，两人从医生办公室和杂货店一回到家，就退到了厨房。 “我以为你已经求婚了，真嗣？你为什么跪下来？”

"Oh, hush up, Auntie!" Asuka smirked as Shinji released his grip on her waist and stood back up, shaking his head with the same silly grin on his face. "Go to the living room and relax, baby. I'll bring you a soda in a sec." Shinji's eyes shot up at this, but knew better than to question Asuka and did exactly as he was told. He tromped off into the living room and took a seat next to Misato.  
“哦，阿姨，你别说话！”真嗣松开了明日香的腰，站了起来，脸上带着同样愚蠢的笑容摇着头。 “去客厅放松一下，宝贝。我一会儿就给你拿瓶苏打水。”真嗣听到这句话，眼睛猛地瞪大，但他知道最好不要去质问明日香，于是他就按照吩咐去做了。他大步走进客厅，在美里旁边坐下。

"Hey, what's up, kiddo?" Misato asked as she sipped her tea. Shinji noticed that her hand was trembling ever so slightly, and her skin tone wasn't as healthy as it normally was. He thought back to what Dr. Akagi had told him days ago and wondered if he needed to start worrying.  
“嘿，怎么了，小家伙？”美里一边喝着茶一边问道。真嗣注意到她的手在轻微地颤抖，而且她的肤色也不像平时那么健康。他回想起几天前赤城医生告诉他的话，想知道他是否需要开始担心。

"Asuka chased me off and told me to sit, so I'm sitting." Shinji replied with a wry grin as he propped his feet up on the coffee table. Misato smiled into her teacup until she noticed a small crease of worry on his brow.  
“明日香把我赶走，让我坐下，所以我就坐着了。”真嗣把脚撑在咖啡桌上，苦笑着回答道。美里对着茶杯微笑，直到她注意到他额头上出现了一丝担忧的皱纹。

"What's wrong, Shinji?" she asked. Misato had known the young man long enough to know when something was bothering him.  
“怎么了，慎二？”她问。美里认识这个年轻人很长时间了，知道他什么时候有什么烦恼。

"Huh? Oh, nothing, Misato," Shinji replied, quickly trying to cover up anything he may have let slip.  
“嗯？哦，没什么，美里，”真嗣回答道，并迅速试图掩盖他可能漏掉的任何事情。

"Bullshit," Misato replied, "I know you better than that! What's wrong?" she cocked an eyebrow while Shinji quickly came up with something other than what he was thinking about.  
“胡说，”美里回答道，“我比那更了解你！出了什么问题？”她挑起一边眉毛，而真嗣很快就想到了一些与他所想的不同的事情。

"I'll tell you in a second," he mouthed as Asuka walked into the room and handed him his drink. "Thanks, hon!" She flashed him a killer smile.  
“我一会儿就告诉你，”当明日香走进房间并递给他饮料时，他用口型说道。 “谢谢，亲爱的！”她向他露出了致命的微笑。

"Dinner will be ready in a few minutes. I'll give you a call when it's done!" the young redhead replied as she turned back to the kitchen and put an extra wiggle in her step, knowing that Shinji was going to watch her the whole way back. She wouldn't have been disappointed in his reaction. He sat there, slack-jawed and totally zoned out.  
“几分钟后晚饭就做好了，做好了我给你打电话！”年轻的红发女郎回答道，她转身回到厨房，脚步更加扭动，因为她知道真嗣会一路注视着她。她不会对他的反应感到失望。他坐在那里，下巴松弛，完全心不在焉。

"Yoo-hoo! Earth to Shinji! Is anyone there?" Misato asked as she waved her hand in front of his face, snapping him out of the spell that the young German had cast.  
“哟呼！地球到真嗣！有人在吗？”美里一边问道，一边在他面前挥了挥手，把他从年轻的德国人施展的咒语中拉了出来。

"Huh?" Shinji asked as he shook his head to cast aside the cobwebs and perverted thoughts that had been flitting around. He turned to see Misato sitting there with a rather malicious grin on her face. _"Aw crap! More teasing fodder!"_ he thought.  
“嗯？”真嗣一边摇头一边问道，将脑海中浮现的蜘蛛网和歪曲的想法抛到一边。他转过头，看到美里坐在那里，脸上挂着略带恶意的笑容。 “噢糟糕！还有更多的戏弄素材！”他以为。

"You were going to say something before the Redheaded Goddess interrupted?" Misato teased, causing Shinji to blush. _"He is still too easy to tease!"_  
“你要在红发女神打断之前说些什么吗？”美里的调侃让真嗣脸红了。 “他还是太容易捉弄了！”

"Uh, well…" Shinji started as he told Misato about what was going on with Mariko. When he finished, Misato's face became a mask of concern.  
“呃，好吧……”真嗣开始向美里讲述真理子的事情。说完，美里的脸上露出了担忧的表情。

"So, do you think I should talk to her?" Misato wondered as she and the young man tried to figure out what to do.  
“那你觉得我该跟她谈谈吗？”美里想知道她和年轻人试图弄清楚该怎么做。

"Probably, I just don't want Asuka to find out!" Shinji whispered, fearing the young German's hearing may have improved with her condition.  
“大概，我只是不想让明日香知道！”真嗣低声说道，担心年轻的德国人的听力可能会随着她的病情而有所改善。

"Dinner's ready!" Asuka's voice cried out, causing Shinji to almost jump out of his skin.  
“晚餐准备好了！”明日香的叫声让真嗣差点从皮肤上跳出来。

"Yeah, we don't need a murder investigation interfering with your wedding," Misato teased as she and Shinji stood up to head for the kitchen.  
“是的，我们不需要谋杀案调查来干扰你们的婚礼，”美里开玩笑说，她和真嗣站起来走向厨房。

Dinner had been a virtual feast, as Shinji sat back and loosened his belt. It had been a very long time since they had a spread like that for dinner. He looked round and was pleased to see that everyone else looked just as miserable as he felt. There was still a huge amount of food left on the table, including the freshly steamed vegetables they had made for Rei, who promptly bowed out and staggered back to her apartment next door.  
晚餐实际上是一场盛宴，真嗣坐下来，松开了腰带。他们已经很久没有吃过这样的晚餐了。他环顾四周，很高兴看到其他人都和他一样痛苦。桌子上还剩下大量的食物，包括他们为丽做的新鲜蒸蔬菜，丽立即退出，摇摇晃晃地回到了隔壁的公寓。

Shinji smiled as he thought about just how far his sister had come since he had first met her. Even after moving her next door, it took a ton of prodding and threats from Asuka and Misato to convince her to come over and eat dinner with them every night. She finally understood that she was as much a part of their weird little family as everyone else. He laughed at the memory of her begging off another plateful of food as Heidi insisted on filling her plate, commenting on how small she was and how she really needed to get some meat on her bones if she wanted to attract guys. Rei had turned so many shades of red at that comment that she looked as if she had spent 7 days out in the desert sun. His complemplation was interrupted by the ringing of the telephone, which he promptly got up to answer as was the custom in the house.  
真嗣微笑着想到自从他第一次见到妹妹以来她已经走了多远。即使把她搬到隔壁，明日香和美里也经过大量的催促和威胁才说服她每天晚上过来和他们一起吃晚饭。她终于明白，她和其他人一样，都是这个奇怪的小家庭的一部分。当海蒂坚持要填满她的盘子时，他嘲笑她乞讨另一盘食物，并评论说她有多小，如果她想吸引男人，她真的需要在骨头上加点肉。听到这句话，丽的脸色变得通红，看起来就像在沙漠的阳光下度过了 7 天一样。他的思考被电话铃声打断了，他按照家里的惯例立即起身接听。

"Asuka? It's for you," he called out as the love of his life came running to him and gave him a quick kiss before mouthing 'Thank you' and proceeded to carry on a conversation in German as he sauntered back to the table to try and relax. Just the effort to move after such a meal was an exquisite agony. Several minutes later, a very pale and shaken Asuka shuffled back to the kitchen, her eyes glazed and reminding Shinji entirely too much of the time just before she suffered her breakdown and fell into a coma.  
“明日香？这是给你的。”当他一生的挚爱跑向他时，他大声喊道，并快速吻了他一下，然后说了声“谢谢”，然后继续用德语交谈，然后慢悠悠地走回餐桌旁。尝试放松。吃完一顿饭后，光是动动身体就已经是一种极大的痛苦。几分钟后，面色苍白、浑身颤抖的明日香拖着脚步走回厨房，她的目光呆滞，让真嗣想起了她精神崩溃、陷入昏迷之前的那段时光。

"Asuka? What's wrong?" Shinji asked with some urgency as he stood to stand by her side. She was scaring him rather badly, not to mention her aunt and guardian as well.  
“明日香？怎么了？”真嗣站在她身边，有些急切地问道。她把他吓坏了，更不用说她的姨妈和监护人了。

"I…I can't believe it," she whispered to no one in particular, "It's horrible… I can't …" With those last words, her eyes rolled back into her head as she collapsed on the spot.  
“我……我简直不敢相信，”她低声对任何人说道，“这太可怕了……我不能……”说完最后一句话，她的眼睛翻了个白眼，当场倒下。

"Asuka!!" Shinji yelled as he reached out and caught his lady before she could hit the floor. Slowly and gently, he fell to his knees and held her close, trying to keep calm and failing to do so miserably. "Asuka? Wake up! What's wrong? Misato!!!"  
“飞鸟！！”真嗣大喊一声，伸手在他的女人倒地之前接住了她。缓慢而温柔地，他跪倒在地，紧紧地抱住她，试图保持冷静，但悲惨地失败了。 “明日香？醒醒！怎么了？美里！！！”

"Oh God!" Misato muttered as she flipped open her cellphone and barked a series of orders into it before she went over and knelt beside Heidi, who was patting Asuka's hand, then turned her wrist over to take her pulse.  
“天啊！”美里一边嘟哝着，一边翻开手机，对着手机发出了一连串的命令，然后走过去跪在海蒂身边，海蒂正在拍着明日香的手，然后翻过手腕来量脉搏。

"She has a pulse, but she's shocky," Heidi said as she felt her niece's forehead and found it cold and clammy. "Shinji! Lay her down and get some pillows and blankets. We need to elevate her legs and keep her warm."  
“她有脉搏，但她很震惊，”海蒂说，她摸了摸侄女的额头，发现它又冷又湿。 “真嗣！让她躺下来，拿一些枕头和毯子。我们需要抬高她的腿，给她保暖。”

"NO! I'm not leaving her!" Shinji growled as he held Asuka tighter. The fire in his eyes was met by the equally intense coldness of Heidi's stare.  
“不！我不会离开她！”真嗣咆哮着，将明日香抱得更紧。他眼中的火焰与海蒂同样冰冷的目光交汇。

"Shinji, she's going into shock. We need to get stabilized as soon as possible. I need you to do as I say so we can help her!"  
“真嗣，她快要休克了。我们需要尽快稳定下来。我需要你按照我说的去做，这样我们才能帮助她！”

"But…" Shinji stammered, looking down at the fragile girl he was holding. He didn't know what to do, and that was driving him crazy.  
“可是……”真嗣低头看着自己怀里脆弱的女孩，结结巴巴地说。他不知道该怎么办，这让他发疯。

"Goddamn it, Captain! Get off your _verdampt_ ass and do as I say! Move it, boy!!" Heidi barked, going into full blown military mode, causing Shinji to jump. He gently laid Asuka on the ground and ran to do as Heidi had commanded.  
“该死的，队长！滚开你的混蛋，照我说的做！移动它，孩子！！”海蒂咆哮着，进入了全面的军事模式，让真嗣跳了起来。他轻轻地将明日香放在地上，然后按照海蒂的命令跑去。

"Sometimes, being ex-military comes in handy," Heidi said to Misato as she quickly checked up on Asuka. Paramedics appeared at the door as soon Shinji came back with the blankets and pillows and hurried to load the Second Child up on the stretcher and rush her down to the ambulance.  
“有时候，退伍军人的身份会派上用场。”海蒂一边快速检查明日香的情况，一边对美里说道。真嗣带着毯子和枕头回来后，医护人员就出现在门口，赶紧把老二抬到担架上，赶紧把她送上救护车。

Much to everyone's delight, Asuka awoke when she was placed in the ambulance. After insisting that she was okay, and threatening to kick Shinji's ass if he didn't stop insisting that she go to the hospital, the medics did a final check on her vital signs and took her back upstairs to rest. After several tense minutes, Asuka finally told everyone what had happened.  
令大家高兴的是，当明日香被送上救护车时她醒了。在坚持说她没事，并威胁真嗣如果不停止坚持让她去医院就踢他的屁股后，医护人员对她的生命体征进行了最后检查，然后把她带回楼上休息。紧张的几分钟后，明日香终于向大家讲述了发生的事情。

"It…it was a phone call from Papa," Asuka stammered, clearly upset, "He told me that he had heard some disturbing news, and said he was coming to Japan to check up on me." Everyone's eyes shot open at that announcement.  
“这……是爸爸打来的电话，”明日香结结巴巴地说，显然很不高兴，“他告诉我他听到了一些令人不安的消息，并说他要来日本看看我的情况。”听到这个消息，所有人都睁大了眼睛。

"Okay, so Erik is coming. We need to figure out what we need to tell him when he gets here. Better yet, we need to see if we can keep him from coming in the first place," Heidi said,obviously not looking forward to seeing her former brother-in-law. "Did he say when he plans on getting here, Asuka?"  
“好吧，埃里克要来了。我们需要弄清楚当他到达这里时我们需要告诉他什么。更好的是，我们首先需要看看我们是否可以阻止他来，”海蒂说，显然没有看期待见到她的前姐夫。 “他有没有说他打算什么时候到这里，明日香？”

"Uh, yeah" Asuka said softly. She wasn't looking forward to seeing her father or step-mother, not like this. "They're on the plane right now. They'll be here tomorrow afternoon!"  
“嗯，是的。”明日香轻声说道。她并不期待见到自己的父亲或继母，不是这样的。 “他们现在在飞机上，明天下午就到了！”

"WHAT?!" bellowed three voices, just as Rei walked in to see what the commotion was about. She promptly spun on her heel to leave, feeling like she had been rudely dismissed by her family before Misato grabbed her by the arm and pulled her back in, letting her in on what had just happened. Plans had to be made, and nobody was going to be left out.  
“什么？！”正当雷走进去看看发生了什么骚动时，三声吼叫。她立即​​转身离开，感觉自己被家人粗鲁地解雇了，然后美里抓住了她的手臂，将她拉了回来，让她了解了刚刚发生的事情。必须制定计划，任何人都不能被排除在外。

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Shinji?" a rather sleepy redhead asked as she raised her head from his chest and looked into his eyes. "You okay?"  
“真嗣？”一个睡眼惺忪的红发女人从他胸前抬起头，看着他的眼睛问道。 “你还好吧？”

"Huh? Oh, yeah, I'm fine, just thinking," he said as he kissed her on the forehead, causing her to coo with content. That sent a shiver up the young man's spine. "I'm sorry if I woke you up."  
“嗯？哦，是的，我很好，只是在想。”他一边说，一边亲吻她的额头，让她心满意足地咕咕叫起来。这让年轻人脊背发凉。 “如果吵醒你了，我很抱歉。”

" S'okay," she murmured as she lay her head back down in his chest. "I'm sorry I scared all of you this evening. It was a bit of a shock, you know?" Shinji smiled as he ran his fingers over her long red tresses.  
“好吧。”她低声说道，把头靠在他的怀里。 “很抱歉今晚我吓到了你们所有人。这有点令人震惊，你知道吗？”真嗣微笑着用手指抚摸着她红色的长发。

"I know, hon," he replied as he felt he snuggle closer to him. He felt a slight dampness on his chest and heard a small sniffle.  
“我知道，亲爱的，”他回答道，感觉自己依偎得更近了。他感到胸口微微湿润，并听到了轻微的抽吸声。

"I'm scared," she said softly, causing Shinji to snuggle back deeper in the bed and wrap his arms around her tighter to comfort her. For someone like Asuka to admit she was frightened really threw Shinji. She was the strongest person he had ever known despite everything that had happened to her. He would lend her his strength to help her through all this.  
“我很害怕，”她轻声说道，让真嗣重新依偎在床上，用双臂更紧地抱住她，安抚她。对于像明日香这样的人来说，承认自己很害怕真的把真嗣吓倒了。尽管她身上发生了一切，但她是他所认识的最坚强的人。他会借给她力量，帮助她度过这一切。

"Shh, it's going to be alright. Just relax and go back to sleep. We'll deal with everything tomorrow," Shinji said soothingly, causing Asuka to snuggle back down and fall once more to sleep, secure in the arms of her champion and husband-to-be. Shinji watched her for several minutes before following her to the Land of Dreams, hoping beyond hope his words would come true.  
“嘘，不会有事的。放松点，回去睡觉吧。明天我们会处理所有的事情。”真嗣安慰道，让明日香重新躺下，再次睡着，安全地在她冠军的怀里和未婚夫。真嗣看了她几分钟，然后跟着她去了梦境之地，无比希望他的话能够实现。

### Chapter 5
"_Scheisse!"_ Asuka screamed as she ran around the apartment, making sure each and everything was perfect. She hadn't seen her father in years, and she wanted to make sure everything met with his approval. She was so scared that he already knew what had happened to her, and she was afraid at what he might do. She really didn't want to be dragged back to Germany kicking and screaming, as if Shinji would allow that.  
“谢瑟！”明日香尖叫着在公寓里跑来跑去，确保每件事都完美无缺。她已经很多年没有见到父亲了，她想确保一切都得到他的认可。她很害怕，因为他已经知道她发生了什么事，她害怕他会做什么。她真的不想被又踢又叫地拖回德国，好像真嗣会允许那样。

"Asuka! Language!" Heidi barked as she sat back on the sofa, a fresh cup of coffee in her hand. She knew that everything was a good as it was going to get, and she equally knew that would have no effect on Erik Soryu whatsoever. He could be a bit of a hard-ass if he had his mind set on a certain path, but she also knew that he had yet come head-to-head with the berserker known as Shinji Ikari.  
“飞鸟！语言！”海蒂坐回沙发上，手里端着一杯新鲜的咖啡，大声叫道。她知道一切都会好起来的，她同样知道这不会对 Erik Soryu 产生任何影响。如果他一心要走某条路的话，他可能会有点强硬，但她也知道，他还没有与名为碇慎司的狂战士正面交锋。

"Yes ma'am!" Asuka called back as she made one more round of the apartment before she walked into a wall named Shinji. "What?!" she asked, exasperated.  
“是的女士！”明日香在公寓里又绕了一圈时回了声，然后才走进一堵名叫真嗣的墙。 “什么？！”她愤怒地问道。

"Asuka, will you calm down and come over to the couch, please? This isn't doing either one of you any good, you know?" he said as he took her hands, which calmed her almost immediately. Shinji lead her to the couch and sat her between himself and Heidi, holding her hand the entire time to keep her calm.  
“明日香，请你冷静下来，到沙发上来好吗？这对你们两个都没有好处，知道吗？”他握住她的手说道，这几乎立刻让她平静下来。真嗣把她带到沙发上，让她坐在自己和海蒂之间，一直握着她的手，让她保持冷静。

"This is driving me nuts!" she grumbled, but remained seated as she felt as if impending doom was getting closer and closer. Rei stood up from the chair she had been seated in, walked over and knelt down before the frightened redhead.  
“这让我发疯！”她抱怨道，但仍坐在座位上，因为她感觉厄运已经越来越近了。丽从她坐的椅子上站起来，走到受惊的红发面前跪下。

"Asuka, what is wrong? Should you not be happy to see your father, especially after so long a time?" Rei asked, crimson eyes meeting blue in a hope for understanding. "I would understand if he is like Shinji's, but you have never really spoken about him before." Shinji coughed a bit and gave his fiancée a quick wink. Asuka had told him the story the previous summer, but he had kept his word and never spoken of it to anyone, even his sister.  
“明日香，怎么了？见到你的父亲，你应该不高兴吧，尤其是在这么长时间之后？”雷问道，深红的眼睛与蓝色的眼睛相遇，希望得到理解。 “如果他像真嗣那样我就能理解，但你以前从未真正谈论过他。”真嗣咳嗽了一声，对他的未婚妻眨了眨眼。去年夏天明日香就告诉过他这个故事，但他信守诺言，从未对任何人提起过这件事，甚至包括他的妹妹。

"It's kind of a long story, Rei. I promise, if I survive this, Shinji and I will sit down with you and tell you all about it," Asuka replied as Rei turned and looked at her brother, a cross look on her face for holding something back from her. Shinji shrugged and started to mumble an apology, but was stopped by a squeeze on his hand from Asuka.  
“这是一个很长的故事，丽。我保证，如果我能活下来，真嗣和我会坐下来告诉你这一切，”明日香回答道，丽转过身来看着她的哥哥，她的表情有些恼怒。因对她隐瞒某事而脸上的表情。真嗣耸耸肩，开始咕哝着道歉，但被明日香捏住他的手制止了。

"Rei, please don't get mad at Shinji, I asked him not to tell anyone. I told him all this last year before we all started getting closer as friends. Okay?" Rei's expression softened as she nodded, but still shot her brother a dirty look as she stood once more to take her seat. She knew that Misato would be back fairly soon with Asuka's parents, and she wanted to be here to support her brother and her friend.  
“丽，请不要生真嗣的气，我让他不要告诉任何人。去年我们开始像朋友一样亲密之前，我就告诉了他这一切。好吗？”丽点点头，表情缓和了一些，但再次站起来坐下时，她还是用脏兮兮的眼神看了哥哥一眼。她知道美里很快就会回到明日香的父母身边，她想来这里支持她的哥哥和她的朋友。

"So, Heidi," Shinji said, breaking the nervous silence that had suddenly blanketed the apartment, "What kind of man is Mr. Soryu? Is he fairly easy to get along with?"  
“那么，海蒂，”真嗣打破了突然笼罩公寓的紧张的沉默，“苍龙先生是一个什么样的人？他是不是很容易相处？”

"Uh, Erik is an…_interesting_…person to get to know," Heidi started, trying to find the words to describe Asuka's father without outright badmouthing the man. She and Erik had never gotten along when her sister had married him, and it was Heidi that had discovered that Erik had been having an affair with Kyoko's doctor while her sister was in the hospital. She still had her doubts about her sister's apparent suicide, and Erik and his wife's possible involvement. "Trust me, Shinji, you'll get to know him rather soon!"  
“呃，埃里克是一个……有趣的……值得认识的人，”海蒂开始说道，试图找到合适的词语来形容明日香的父亲，但又不至于公然说他的坏话。当她的姐姐嫁给他时，她和埃里克一直不和，是海蒂发现了埃里克在她姐姐住院期间与京子的医生有染。她仍然对她姐姐明显的自杀以及埃里克和他的妻子可能参与其中持怀疑态度。 “相信我，真嗣，你很快就会认识他的！”

"We're home!" Misato's voice called out as she slid the door open. Asuka went deathly white as she and everyone else in the apartment jumped to their feet and stood, waiting for Misato to escort the German couple into the living room. Shinji reached over and took Asuka's hand once more to calm her fears. Asuka shot him a sad little smile and mouthed 'I love you' as she turned to greet her parents.  
“我们到家了！”当她推开门时，美里的声音响起。明日香的脸色惨白，她和公寓里的其他人都跳了起来，站着，等待美里护送这对德国夫妇进入客厅。真嗣伸出手，再次握住明日香的手，以平息她的恐惧。明日香向他露出悲伤的微笑，转身向父母打招呼，并用口型说“我爱你”。

"Hello, Papa!" Asuka greeted her father as soon as he entered the living room, as she rushed over to wrap him in a hug, but was stopped short by the look he gave her. Her eyes widened as she saw something in his eye that she had no desire to see whatsoever: disappointment.  
“你好，爸爸！”父亲一进客厅，明日香就向他打招呼，她冲过去拥抱他，但被他看向她的眼神打住了。她睁大了眼睛，在他眼里看到了她不想看到的东西：失望。

"Asuka," he said mechanically, as he nodded to her before stepping aside and allowing his wife to enter the room beside him, with Misato right on her heels. His eyes swept the room before they locked onto the other redhead in the room. "Heidi. I might have known."  
“明日香，”他机械地说道，向她点点头，然后退到一边，让妻子进入他旁边的房间，美里紧随其后。他的目光扫过房间，然后锁定了房间里的另一个红发。 “海蒂。我也许就知道了。”

"It's good to see you again, Erik," Heidi said sarcastically, taking note of his attitude and the tone of his voice. He was exactly as she remembered: medium build and height, dark hair with a rapidly receding hairline, and with the same look and air of superiority that had bothered her for years. It always felt as if Erik had always looked down his nose at everyone he had ever met, even those he claimed to be close to. His wife had the same feeling about her, one that drove Heidi crazy since the first time she had met her as Kyoko's doctor, then later when she discovered the affair between the doctor and the supposed caring husband. "You as well, Sonya."  
“很高兴再次见到你，埃里克，”海蒂讽刺地说，注意到他的态度和语气。他和她记忆中的一模一样：中等身材，身高，黑发，发际线迅速后退，有着困扰她多年的相貌和优越感。总感觉埃里克总是瞧不起他见过的每一个人，甚至是那些他自称很亲近的人。他的妻子对她也有同样的感觉，自从海蒂第一次见到她作为恭子的医生，以及后来她发现医生和所谓的关心丈夫之间的婚外情时，这种感觉就让海蒂抓狂了。 “你也是，索尼娅。”

"Nice to see that things haven't changed much, Heidi," Dr. Sonya Soryu retorted with a sniff, "Still the same…_free spirit_…as before. Shame, really." Heidi clinched her fist as she tried to keep her emotions in check. She was here for Asuka, not to start a fight with a stuck-up tramp.  
“很高兴看到事情没有太大变化，海蒂，”Sonya Soryu 博士吸了吸鼻子反驳道，“还是一样……自由精神……和以前一样。真可惜。”海蒂握紧了拳头，试图控制自己的情绪。她是来找明日香的，不是来跟一个自以为是的流浪汉打架的。

"Uh… Papa, let me introduce you to everyone. You already know Aunt Heidi," Asuka said as Erik snorted and crossed his arms, " This is Rei Ayanami, pilot of Unit 00..."  
“呃……爸爸，让我给大家介绍一下。你们已经认识海蒂阿姨了，”明日香说道，艾瑞克哼了一声，交叉着双臂，“这是绫波丽，00号机组的飞行员……”

"Pleased to meet you, sir," Rei said softly as she bowed to the older couple, who took no notice of her. Rei looked slightly hurt at being ignored so, which angered Asuka and Shinji. They both did their best to suppress it, seeing to the delicate nature of the meeting.  
“很高兴见到您，先生。”雷轻声说道，向那对年长的夫妇鞠躬，但他们并没有注意到她。丽看起来被忽视了，有点受伤，这激怒了明日香和真嗣。鉴于这次会面的微妙性，他们都尽力压制着。

"And this is Shinji Ikari, Pilot of Unit 01," Asuka continued as she walked over to stand beside Shinji, who extended his hand in greeting.  
“这是碇真嗣，01号机的飞行员。”明日香继续说道，她走过去站在碇真嗣身边，碇真嗣伸出手来打招呼。

"Pleased to meet you, sir," Shinji said with sincerity, while Erik looked at Shinji's hand as if it were something distasteful, before he finally took it and gave a quick but firm handshake.  
“很高兴见到你，先生。”真嗣真诚地说，而埃里克则看着真嗣的手，就好像它是什么令人厌恶的东西一样，最后他最终握住了它，快速而坚定地握了握手。

"Ikari? As in Gendo Ikari?" Asuka's father asked, his face looking as if he had just eaten a barrel of lemons. He didn't like how close his daughter was standing to the young man, especially after the rumors he had heard back at the German branch of NERV.  
“碇？就像碇源堂那样？”明日香的父亲问道，他的表情就像刚刚吃了一桶柠檬一样。他不喜欢他的女儿和这个年轻人站得太近，尤其是在他从 NERV 德国分部听到谣言之后。

"Yes sir, he is my…father," Shinji affirmed. Erik looked visibly shaken, now he really didn't like the fact his daughter stood so close to the younger Ikari. Asuka seemed to shrink at the intensity of her father's stare. A grimace formed on her father's mouth, but before he could speak, Misato spoke up.  
“是的，先生，他是我的……父亲，”真嗣肯定道。 Erik看起来明显很震惊，现在他真的不喜欢他的女儿离小碇太近了。明日香似乎因父亲强烈的目光而畏缩起来。父亲的嘴角露出一丝苦笑，但还没等他说话，美里就开口了。

"Would everyone like some tea?" she asked, getting an affirmative from everyone but the Soryus. Erik shook his head violently before turning to his wife.  
“大家要喝茶吗？”她问道，得到了除了索留斯之外的所有人的肯定。 Erik猛烈地摇摇头，然后转向他的妻子。

"Well, is it true?" he asked his wife, who had been studying Asuka closely the entire time they had stood there. She nodded.  
“嗯，是真的吗？”他问他的妻子，他们站在那里的整个过程中，她一直在仔细地研究明日香。她点点头。

"From what I can see, it is. She's still in her first trimester, so termination shouldn't be a problem," Dr. Soryu added in a cold, clinical tone. Everyone froze.  
“据我所知，确实如此。她仍处于妊娠前三个月，所以终止妊娠应该不成问题，”Soryu 博士用冷酷、冷静的语气补充道。所有人都愣住了。

"Mr. Soryu…" Misato started before being rudely cut off by Asuka's father.  
“苍龙先生……”美里刚开口就被明日香的父亲粗鲁地打断了。

"Forgive me for being a poor guest, _Major_," Erik spat as he whirled to face Misato, "But I don't have time for such nonsense! I have received some disturbing news, and I have come here to discover just what is going on and to fix the situation." He spun back to Asuka, who was still pale as death.  
“请原谅我是个可怜的客人，少校，”埃里克一边转身面对美里，一边吐口水，“但我没有时间说这些废话！我收到了一些令人不安的消息，我来这里是为了了解到底是什么。”继续下去并解决这个问题。”他转回到明日香身边，后者的脸色仍然苍白得像死人一样。

"What…what is it, Papa?" Asuka asked in a scared little girl's voice. That didn't effect her father whatsoever, as his scowl grew deeper and fire flared in his eyes.  
“什么……这是什么，爸爸？”明日香用小女孩害怕的声音问道。但这并没有影响到她的父亲，他的眉头皱得更深了，眼里燃烧着火焰。

" I have heard from my sources that you are pregnant, Asuka. Is this true?" he barked, causing the hackles to rise on the back of Shinji's neck. Asuka felt his tension and squeezed his hand gently, calming him slightly. This did not go un-noticed by Dr. Soryu.  
“我从我的消息来源听说你怀孕了，明日香。这是真的吗？”他咆哮着，真嗣脖子后面的汗毛竖了起来。明日香感受到了他的紧张，轻轻捏了捏他的手，让他稍微平静下来。 Soryu 博士并没有忽视这一点。

"Erik!" Heidi barked back, ready to tear him to shreds at yelling at his daughter, especially in her condition.  
“埃里克！”海蒂吼了回来，准备把他撕成碎片，因为他对女儿大喊大叫，尤其是在她的情况下。

"Shut your mouth, Heidi!" Dr. Soryu screeched, "This has nothing to do with you! If anything, it's probably your attitude that has caused this in the first place!" Heidi gasped and was ready to pummel Asuka's stepmother before Erik cut her off.  
“闭嘴，海蒂！” Soryu博士尖叫道：“这与你无关！如果有的话，可能是你的态度导致了这一切！”海蒂喘着粗气，准备殴打明日香的继母，但埃里克打断了她的话。

"Well, Asuka? I'm waiting!" Erik growled as he crossed his arms once more and stood over Asuka, allowing his superior height to dominate the young German, making her feel ever so small before her father.  
“嗯，明日香？我等着呢！”埃里克咆哮着，再次交叉双臂站在明日香身边，让他优越的身高压倒了这位年轻的德国人，让她在父亲面前感到如此渺小。

"Yes sir, it's true," Asuka said sadly as she used her free hand to reach over and rub her slightly bulging belly. Her father snorted in disgust before turning to Misato.  
“是的，先生，确实如此。”明日香悲伤地说，同时用空着的那只手伸过去揉着微微鼓起的小腹。她的父亲厌恶地哼了一声，然后转向美里。

"Just what the hell kind of guardian are you, to allow my daughter to go out and make a slut of herself?!" he yelled into Misato's face, causing a collective gasp to resonate throughout the room. Tears formed in Asuka's eyes at what her father had just said, as Shinji wrapped his arms around her to comfort her. Erik spun back around and quickly pulled Asuka from Shinji's grasp and held her tightly by the arm, causing her to cry out. This was almost beyond what Shinji could stand.  
“你到底是个什么守护神，竟然允许我女儿出去放荡？！”他对着美里的脸大喊，引起整个房间的集体喘息。听到父亲刚才的话，明日香的眼里涌出了泪水，真嗣用双臂搂住她安慰她。埃里克转过身来，迅速将明日香从真嗣手中拉出来，紧紧地抓住她的手臂，让她哭了出来。这几乎超出了真嗣的承受范围。

"You! Another fucking Ikari! You're just like your father, aren't you?!" Erik spat in the younger man's face, "Are you the father? You must be! All you damn Ikari's just take whatever the hell you want to and don't give a damn about anyone else!"  
“你！又一个他妈的碇！你就像你父亲一样，不是吗？！” Erik朝年轻人脸上啐了一口，“你是父亲吗？你一定是！你们这些该死的Ikari都只是随心所欲，别在意其他任何人！”

"Papa! No!" Asuka yelled, tears streaming down her face, both in physical and emotional pain, "Shinji's not the father! He's my fiancé!" Erik turned back to her in shock, the grip on her arm tightening even further. Everyone else in the room just stood in shock at how fast and how badly events had just turned in the home.  
“爸爸！不！”明日香泪流满面，痛苦地喊道：“真嗣不是父亲！他是我的未婚夫！” Erik震惊地转向她，抓紧了她的手臂。房间里的其他人都震惊地发现家里的事态发展得如此之快、如此严重。

"What? Your fiancé?" Asuka's stepmother asked, "That isn't possible, you are too young to marry without parental permission! And that is something we shall not give!"  
“什么？你的未婚夫？”明日香的继母问道：“那不可能，你还太小，没有父母的同意不能结婚！而且这是我们不会给予的！”

"Just who the hell is the father?" Erik screamed while Asuka gave him a quick run down on what had happened. Rather than become sympathetic to his daughter's plight, Erik got even more angry. "So, you turned out to be as much of a slut and a tramp as your mother and your aunt!"  
“孩子的父亲到底是谁？” Erik 尖叫起来，Asuka 快速地向他讲述了发生的事情。埃里克不但没有同情女儿的困境，反而更加愤怒。 “原来你和你妈、你姨妈一样都是荡妇、流浪汉！”

"Papa! No! I'm a good girl!" Asuka bawled, tears flowing faster than a waterfall, "We don't know what happened!" Her stepmother walked up to her and stood nose-to-nose with her.  
“爸爸！不！我是个好女孩！”明日香嚎啕大哭，泪水比瀑布流得还快，“我们不知道发生了什么！”她的继母走到她面前，与她面对面地站着。

"All the more reason to terminate the pregnancy!" Dr. Soryu said through gritted teeth. "We don't need an unwed mother and a bastard to tarnish the Soryu name! It is the best option for everyone!" At this, Shinji's vision was beginning to go red at the edges, as he did everything he could to keep the beast from being unleashed.  
“更有理由终止妊娠！”苍龙博士咬牙切齿地说。 “我们不需要一个未婚妈妈和一个私生子来玷污苍龙的名字！这对每个人来说都是最好的选择！”此时，真嗣的视野开始变得红色，他竭尽全力阻止野兽被释放。

"Papa! No! You can't kill my baby!" Asuka begged as she did her best to break free from her father's grasp. Erik merely snarled, as he pulled her closer to his face.  
“爸爸！不！你不能杀我的孩子！”明日香一边哀求着，一边竭尽全力想要挣脱父亲的掌控。 Erik只是咆哮了一声，将她拉近自己的脸。

"Shut the hell up, you little bitch! You have no say in this at all! Get ready to pack your shit up, because you're coming home to Germany with us immediately! I'll not have any little bastards running around in this family, do you understand that?" he snarled. Shinji's vision was now almost completely red, as Rei glanced over and saw how violently her brother was trembling.  
“闭嘴，你这个小贱人！你在这件事上根本没有发言权！准备好收拾你的狗屎，因为你马上就要和我们一起回德国了！我不会让任何小混蛋在家里乱跑的。”这一家人，你明白吗？”他咆哮道。真嗣的视线现在几乎完全变红，丽瞥了一眼，看到她哥哥正在剧烈地颤抖。

"Shinji?" Asuka begged as she looked around her father to see the internal struggle her fiancé was fighting. She knew that all hell was about to break loose. Erik turned to look back at the young Ikari, rage contorting his features as his daughter looked on with fear and hope.  
“真嗣？”明日香环顾父亲周围，看到未婚夫内心的挣扎，她恳求道。她知道一切地狱即将爆发。 Erik转身回头看着年轻的Ikari，愤怒扭曲了他的面容，而他的女儿则带着恐惧和希望看着。

"We are to be married next week," Shinji said through clenched teeth, "now kindly remove your hands from my lady at this time." The intensity in Shinji's voice was lost on the older couple, but not to the other people in the room. Rei's eyes widened as she took a small step toward her brother.  
“我们下周就要结婚了，”真嗣咬牙切齿地说，“现在请把你的手从我的女士身上拿开。”这对老夫妇听不到真嗣声音的强度，但房间里的其他人却听不到。丽睁大了眼睛，向哥哥迈出了一小步。

"There is no way I'm going to allow my daughter to marry a fucking Ikari!" Erik growled as he nodded to his wife, who reached into her purse. " Now, go get packed, you little whore!" Erik pushed his daughter in the direction of the bedrooms, and did so with enough force that she was thrown across the room and slammed against the wall. Asuka's eyes rolled back into her head as she slid down the wall into crumpled heap. That was the biggest mistake of Erik's life.  
“我绝对不会允许我的女儿嫁给一个该死的碇！”埃里克咆哮着，向妻子点点头，妻子把手伸进了钱包。 “现在，去收拾行李吧，你这个小贱人！”埃里克把他的女儿推向卧室的方向，用力很大，结果她被扔到了房间的另一边，撞到了墙上。当明日香沿着墙壁​​滑落成皱巴巴的一堆东西时，她的眼睛又翻了起来。这是埃里克一生中最大的错误。

A gunshot rang out, followed quickly by a sharp yell. Erik spun in the direction of the noise to see his wife sprawled back over the back of the couch, obviously unconscious. Within the space of a heartbeat, Erik felt a horrible pressure in his throat and was slammed violently to the ground as the pressure increased. Gagging, Erik looked up to see the face that could send Angels screaming for mercy. He had come face-to-face with the Berserker.  
一声枪响，紧接着是一声尖锐的叫喊。 Erik转向声音传来的方向，看到他的妻子四仰八叉地躺在沙发后面，显然已经不省人事了。心跳的一瞬间，埃里克就感觉到喉咙里一股可怕的压力，随着压力的增大，他被狠狠地摔在了地上。 Erik作呕，抬头看到了这张足以让天使尖叫求饶的脸。他和狂战士面对面了。

"That was the worst thing you could have ever done," growled a voice that was nowhere near human, but that of an animal defending it's mate. "Say goodbye, bastard!" Erik merely gurgled as his face turned the most interesting shade of red that was quickly heading into a rather nice tone of purple, when Shinji heard a voice calling to him from a far distance, even though it as right behind his ear.  
“这是你做过的最糟糕的事情，”一个声音咆哮道，这声音远非人类，而是动物保卫其伴侣的声音。 “说再见吧，混蛋！” Erik只是咯咯地笑了一声，他的脸变成了最有趣的红色，很快就变成了相当漂亮的紫色，这时Shinji听到一个声音从远处呼唤他，尽管它就在他的耳后。

"Shinji, do not do it, you must let him go!" Rei pleaded as she wrapped her hands around his arms to try to save the German's life. Shinji would not budge, no matter how hard she tried.  
“真嗣，别这么做，你必须放开他！”雷一边恳求，一边用双手搂住他的手臂，试图挽救德国人的生命。无论真嗣如何努力，她都不肯让步。

"He hurt Asuka, Rei! Go check on her, please!" Shinji seethed as he continued to pour his strength through his arm to his hand, doing his best to crush the older man's throat. Rei realized that nothing she could do would stop Shinji, and only one person on the planet had that kind of power. Unfortunately, she was currently unconscious and being tended by her aunt. Rei looked at the rage on her brother's face and decided she needed to get Asuka awake as quickly as possible. She ran over to help Heidi see to Asuka.  
“他伤害了明日香，丽！请去看看她！”真嗣浑身沸腾，继续将力量从手臂倾注到手上，竭尽全力想要掐断老人的喉咙。丽意识到她无法阻止真嗣，而这个星球上只有一个人拥有这种力量。不幸的是，她目前昏迷不醒，由姨妈照顾。丽看着哥哥脸上的愤怒，决定尽快让明日香醒来。她跑过去帮海蒂照顾明日香。

"Shinji, you need to let him go," Misato said very calmly but intensely, using all the power of her command presence to end the situation. Unfortunately, that was like an air rifle trying to sink an aircraft carrier, and just as effective. Shinji merely shrugged off the suggestion like it was an annoying fly.  
“真嗣，你需要放了他，”美里非常平静但强烈地说，利用她指挥存在的所有力量来结束这种情况。不幸的是，这就像试图击沉航空母舰的气步枪一样有效。真嗣对这个建议只是耸耸肩，就像对待一只烦人的苍蝇一样。

"He can go to Hell, Misato! I'll send him there shortly!" he growled as he turned his head to look at his guardian. He noticed that she had her pistol out, and instead of pointing it at him, she had it pointed at Asuka's stepmother. Dr. Soryu looked horrible, as a huge purple welt started to rise on her cheek, and blood poured down her chin from her split lip. The handgun she had pulled from her purse was still laying on the carpet next to Misato's feet, smoke pouring from the barrel. His eyes squinted in anger at the thought of someone coming into his home and using a firearm to separate him from his love. He turned back to Erik once more, who was just on the verge of passing out.  
“他会下地狱的，美里！我很快就会送他去那里！”他转过头看向他的守护者，咆哮道。他注意到她拿出了手枪，但不是指向他，而是指向明日香的继母。 Soryu医生看起来很可怕，她的脸颊上开始出现一条巨大的紫色伤痕，鲜血从她裂开的嘴唇流到下巴。她从钱包里拿出的手枪还放在美里脚边的地毯上，枪管里冒着烟。一想到有人闯入他的家，用枪将他与他的爱人分开，他的眼睛就愤怒地眯起。他再次转向埃里克，埃里克正处于昏倒的边缘。

"How could you do that? To your own flesh and blood? Just what the hell kind of father are you?" Shinji seethed as he stared deep into Erik's soul, finding it dark and bleak. All Erik could do was gurgle as his arms went slack, and his eyes tried to focus on something beyond Shinji. Shinji didn't care what the German saw until he felt a light touch on his arm, a touch that was so familiar and so loving it instantly melted his heart.  
“你怎么能这么做？为了你自己的骨肉？你到底是什么父亲？”当真嗣深深地凝视着埃里克的灵魂时，他发现它黑暗而凄凉。 Erik所能做的就是咯咯地笑，他的手臂松弛下来，他的眼睛试图把注意力集中在真嗣之外的东西上。真嗣并不在乎德国人看到了什么，直到他感觉到自己的手臂被轻轻碰了一下，这种碰触是那么熟悉、那么可爱，瞬间融化了他的心。

"Shinji? Baby? Please don't…don't kill my Papa," Asuka begged as she fell to floor beside him and leaned up against him, doing everything she could to calm the rage. Within a heartbeat, The Berserker vanished, as a very angry, yet frightened, young man took it's place. He looked at horror at what was happening before him. Asuka reached down and took Shinji's hands and slowly lifted them from her father's throat.  
“真嗣？宝贝？请不要……不要杀我爸爸。”明日香跪倒在他身旁的地板上，靠在他身上，竭尽全力平息怒火。眨眼之间，狂战士就消失了，取而代之的是一个非常愤怒但又害怕的年轻人。他惊恐地看着眼前发生的一切。明日香伸手握住真嗣的手，慢慢地将它们从她父亲的喉咙上拿开。

With a huge gasp, Erik Soryu caught his breath as he tried to sit up, but was still pinned by the young man who had held his life, literally, in his hands. Asuka grabbed Shinji and the young couple rose as one and stepped away from the fallen man, holding on to each other for dear life. Rei, Heidi, and Misato quickly joined together and stood between the younger couple and the older couple, who were now trying to nurse their wounds.  
埃里克·索留喘着粗气，试图坐起身来，但仍被那个真正掌握了他生命的年轻人按在了手里。明日香抓住了真嗣，这对年轻夫妇合二为一地站了起来，从倒下的男人身边走开，为了亲爱的生命而紧紧抓住彼此。丽、海蒂和美里很快就走到了一起，站在正在治疗伤口的年轻夫妇和年长夫妇之间。

"Asuka isn't going anywhere she doesn't want to," Misato said, arms crossed and daring the older Germans to try anything. Wheezing, Asuka's father got to his feet and went over to check up on his wife, gently touching the rising purple patch on her cheek. With as much anger as he could muster, he turned back and stared at Shinji.  
“明日香不会去任何她不想去的地方，”美里交叉双臂说道，鼓励年长的德国人尝试任何事情。明日香的父亲气喘吁吁地站起来，走过去查看妻子的情况，轻轻抚摸她脸颊上凸起的紫色斑块。他带着尽可能多的愤怒，转过身来盯着真嗣。

"How DARE you strike my wife! Leave it to an Ikari to treat his guests in such a fashion!" he snarled, then coughed hoarsely. His wife shook her head, then felt the lump that was rising on the back of her head where it had met the floor on the other side of the couch. She started looking around on the floor for something, until her shoulders fell in dismay at seeing the firearm she had earlier now firmly in the grasp of Major Katsuragi.  
“你怎么敢打我的妻子！就让碇用这种方式对待他的客人吧！”他咆哮着，然后嘶哑地咳嗽起来。他的妻子摇了摇头，然后感觉到后脑勺与沙发另一侧地板接触处的肿块正在升起。她开始在地板上四处寻找什么东西，直到她的肩膀沮丧地垂下来，因为她之前拥有的枪支现在牢牢地掌握在葛城少校的手中。

"How dare such a 'guest' bring a weapon into my house and brandish it, with CHILDREN present!" Misato shot back as both Soryus realized that they had been caught flatfooted. What really puzzled Dr. Soryu was how in the world she had ended up on the floor and the gun laying several feet away.  
“这样的‘客人’竟然敢在孩子们在场的情况下将武器带入我家并挥舞它！”当索留斯意识到自己被打了个措手不及时，美里反击了。真正让 Soryu 博士困惑的是，她到底是怎么倒在地板上的，而枪却放在几英尺外。

"We brought it because we knew you would be unreasonable!" Erik wheezed, still shooting daggers in Shinji's direction. Shinji's eyes met his once more, causing the older man to cringe as he saw the dormant Berserker, lying just below the surface.  
“我们带来它是因为我们知道你会不讲道理！” Erik喘息着，仍然朝真嗣的方向射出匕首。真嗣的目光再次与他对视，当他看到躺在地表以下的休眠狂战士时，年长者感到畏缩。

"Unreasonable?!" Heidi screeched, her own eyes blazing with a fire that would do Asuka proud, "You come in here, telling everyone that you're going to abort Asuka's baby, call her names , insult your hosts, and then injure your own daughter! How the hell is that reasonable?!" Heidi was about to start in again when Misato walked forward and started pushing The Soryus from the living room, and down the hall toward the door.  
“不合理？！”海蒂尖叫起来，她的眼睛里燃烧着让明日香感到骄傲的火焰，“你来到这里，告诉所有人你要堕掉明日香的孩子，辱骂她，侮辱你的主人，然后伤害你自己的女儿！怎么了！这他妈有道理吗？！”海蒂正要重新开始，美里向前走去，开始把索留斯从客厅推开，沿着走廊朝门口走去。

"We are not leaving without Asuka!" her father bellowed as best he could as he was shoved out the door, followed quickly by his wife. Misato stood there, arms crossed and barring his way from going back in.  
“我们不会离开明日香的！”她的父亲被推出门外时竭尽全力地吼叫着，他的妻子也紧随其后。美里站在那里，双臂交叉，挡住了他回去的路。

"Papa, I don't want to leave! This is my home!" Asuka pleaded, hoping her father would see reason, " Shinji loves me! He loves our baby! Misato and Rei love me too! I have friends here who care about me! I've never felt so much love and friendship as I have since I got here! I can't give that up! Please, don't you understand? I don't want to be all alone again!" Tears poured down her cheeks as she leaned against Shinji for support. She had never really cared what her father had thought before, but this was so very different. She wanted his blessing, but that was not coming.  
“爸爸，我不想走！这是我的家！”明日香恳求着，希望她的父亲能明白道理，“真嗣爱我！他爱我们的孩子！美里和丽也爱我！我这里有关心我的朋友！我从来没有像现在这样感受到如此多的爱和友谊。”我已经到了这里，我不能放弃，你明白吗？”当她靠在真嗣身上寻求支撑时，泪水从她的脸颊上流下来。以前她从来没有真正在意过父亲的想法，但这一次却截然不同。她想要他的祝福，但这并没有到来。

"You want to stay here? Fine, you can stay here, you tramp! You are not my daughter anymore! I wash my hands of you! You are no longer a Soryu, do you understand that?" Erik snarled, looking past Misato and seeing what kind of effect it was having on Asuka.  
“你想留在这里？好吧，你可以留在这里，你这个流浪汉！你不再是我的女儿了！我不再对你动手了！你不再是苍龙了，你明白吗？” Erik咆哮道，目光越过美里，看看这对明日香产生了什么样的影响。

"No! Please! Papa!" the young redhead begged, not knowing why this was so important to her, "Please don't stop being my Papa! Can't you understand how I feel?"  
“不！拜托！爸爸！”年轻的红发女郎恳求道，不知道为什么这对她如此重要，“请不要停止做我的爸爸！你难道不明白我的感受吗？”

"I don't give a damn how you feel! You have dishonored me and your stepmother with your trashy ways! This is your last chance, Asuka! Either come with me right now, or stay and marry that little bastard, knowing that you'll never be my daughter again! That is your only choice!" her father demanded. Asuka stood next to her fiancé, drawing strength from him, then shook her head.  
“我不在乎你的感受！你用你的垃圾方式羞辱了我和你的继母！这是你最后的机会，明日香！要么现在就跟我走，要么留下来嫁给那个小混蛋，因为你知道你永远不再是我的女儿了！”她父亲问道。明日香站在未婚夫身边，从他身上汲取力量，然后摇了摇头。

"No, Papa. You may not want me as…as a daughter anymore, but there are people here that do love me, and do so unconditionally. I'm going to stay he…here," she said, sniffling and doing her best not to break down anymore. "I'm staying here, having my baby, and raising a family with those who love me." With that last statement, she stood tall, her chin held high, and looking like the Asuka of old.  
“不，爸爸。你可能不再想要我……作为一个女儿，但这里有人确实爱我，而且是无条件地爱我。我要让他……留在这里，”她抽着鼻子说，做着她的事。最好不要再崩溃了。 “我要留在这里，生孩子，和爱我的人一起组建家庭。”说完最后一句话，她站得笔直，下巴高高扬起，看起来就像过去的明日香。

"So be it!" Erik snarled as he felt the hands of Section Two agents clasp him on the shoulder and start to drag him away from the apartment. "This isn't over, you can believe that! Tomorrow, I'm going to the head bastard and setting everything straight! You can go to hell, you little whore!" He and his wife disappeared as they were escorted down the hallway and into the awaiting elevator.  
“就这样吧！”当Erik感觉到第二区特工的双手抓住他的肩膀并开始把他拖离公寓时，他咆哮道。 “这还没有结束，你可以相信！明天，我要去找那个混蛋，把一切都搞清楚！你可以下地狱了，你这个小妓女！”当他和他的妻子被护送穿过走廊并进入等待的电梯时就消失了。

"Why? Why did he have to be that way?" Asuka mumbled as Shinji took her in his arms and lead her back to the couch, where they sat as Heidi came back over to make sure that she was physically okay.  
“为什么？为什么他一定要这样？”当真嗣把她抱回沙发上时，明日香咕哝着，他们坐在那里，海蒂回来确认她的身体状况是否良好。

_"The emotional wounds are going to take longer to heal,"_ Heidi mused as she checked Asuka over, then reached over and gave her a huge hug. Asuka broke down and cried loudly into her aunt's shoulder, as Shinji leaned over and completed the hug sandwich. Misato and Rei came over and comforted her for as long as they could before the stress of the night got to her.  
“情感上的创伤需要更长的时间才能愈合，”海蒂一边沉思着，一边检查明日香，然后伸手给了她一个大大的拥抱。当真嗣俯身完成拥抱三明治时，明日香崩溃了，靠在姨妈的肩膀上大声哭泣。美里和丽走过来，在夜晚的压力降临到她身上之前尽可能地安慰她。

Shinji gently helped her up and walked her to the bedroom. Without any embarrassment whatsoever, Shinji helped her get undressed and then into the sleeping shirt he had given her. The whole time, she leaned on him, resting her head on his shoulder until he walked her over to the bed. Tucking her in, he knelt next to the bed and looked her in the eyes. Her eyes were full of sadness, but deep below was love, and he knew it was aimed at him. Guilt filled him as he recalled his actions earlier.  
真嗣轻轻地扶起她，送她往卧室走去。真嗣毫不尴尬地帮她脱掉衣服，然后穿上他给她的睡衣。整个过程中，她都靠在他身上，把头靠在他的肩膀上，直到他把她带到床边。他给她盖好被子，跪在床边，看着她的眼睛。她的眼神里满是悲伤，但内心深处却是爱意，他知道那是冲着他来的。回想起之前的举动，他心中充满愧疚。

"Asuka, I just want to say…I'm sorry for what happened earlier," Shinji said as he reached over and stroked her hair, causing her to make the cooing noises that drove him silly, "I wasn't trying to kill your father, it's just after seeing what he did to you, I kinda…" She silenced him with a finger to the lips.  
“明日香，我只是想说……我对之前发生的事情感到抱歉，”真嗣说着伸手抚摸着她的头发，让她发出了让他发傻的咕咕声，“我并不是想杀人你的父亲，在看到他对你做了什么之后，我有点……”她用一根手指放在嘴唇上让他安静下来。

"Shinji, I know," she replied as she stroked his cheek "It just kinda scared me, is all." He reached up and placed his hand on the one stroking his cheek, basking in the warm glow her touch gave him.  
“真嗣，我知道，”她一边抚摸着他的脸颊一边回答道，“只是我有点害怕，仅此而已。”他抬起手，放在抚摸着自己脸颊的那只手上，沐浴在她的触碰所带来的温暖光芒中。

"I'm sorry," he mumbled once more, as she gave him a mock glare for apologizing again. Something then drew her eyes to his face.  
“我很抱歉，”他再次咕哝道，而她则假装瞪了他一眼，再次道歉。然后有什么东西把她的目光吸引到他的脸上。

"Shinji, what happened to your hand?" she asked, as she stared at the long bloody scratch on the back of his hand. He pulled his hand back and looked closely at it before putting it down by his side.  
“慎二，你的手怎么了？”她盯着他手背上那道长长的血迹斑斑的抓痕问道。他把手抽了回来，仔细看了看，然后放在了身边。

"Must have scratched it somehow," he muttered as he stood from the bed and turned the light out. She smirked at him.  
“肯定是被什么东西刮伤了。”他从床上站起来，关掉了灯，嘟哝道。她对他笑了笑。

"Well, d'uh!" she answered as she smiled for the first time since her father had arrived. Shinji stuck his tongue out at her before bending down to give her a kiss. "Keep that up, and I'll bite it off!"  
“嗯，呃！”她微笑着回答，这是她父亲到来以来第一次微笑。真嗣向她伸出舌头，然后弯下腰吻了她。 “再坚持一下，我就咬掉它！”

"Promises, promises," he said with a grin as he kissed her once more and turned to leave the room. Asuka was asleep before he finished closing the door.  
“保证，保证。”他笑着说，再次吻了她，然后转身离开了房间。关门之前，明日香已经睡着了。

"Well, this was one hell of a night," Shinji muttered as he walked back to the living room and sat back down on the sofa, as Rei and Heidi took seats on either side of him.  
“好吧，这真是一个地狱般的夜晚，”真嗣一边嘀咕着，一边走回客厅，坐回沙发上，而丽和海蒂则坐在他两侧。

"Yeah, it could have gone a little better," Misato added as she sat in the chair that Rei had sat in earlier.  
“是的，本来可以做得更好一点，”美里坐在丽之前坐过的椅子上补充道。

"Why would her father treat her in such a bad fashion?" Rei asked, her crimson eyes wide and glistening with unshed tears. She had never really ever shown very much emotion, but this evening's events had pushed her to the limits.  
“为什么她的父亲要这么恶劣地对待她？”丽睁大着猩红的眼睛，闪烁着未流下的泪水问道。她从来没有真正表现过太多的情绪，但今晚的事件却把她推向了极限。

"People like Asuka's father are more worried about appearances and how others think of them rather than the good or welfare of their loved ones," Heidi replied sadly, her blood still boiling over how Erik had treated her niece. Rei tilted her head a bit, still puzzled.  
“像明日香的父亲这样的人更关心外表和别人对他们的看法，而不是他们所爱的人的利益或幸福，”海蒂悲伤地回答道，她的血液仍然为埃里克对待她侄女的方式而沸腾。雷伊微微歪着头，一脸疑惑。

"He was more worried at how people would think of him. He was afraid they would think he was a horrible person for not keeping his daughter from getting pregnant. There are still some places in the world where being an unwed mother is considered taboo," Shinji added, causing a bit of color to rise to Rei's cheeks.  
“他更担心人们会如何看待他。他担心他们会认为他是一个可怕的人，因为他没有阻止女儿怀孕。世界上仍然有一些地方，未婚妈妈被认为是禁忌，真嗣补充道，让丽的脸颊泛起一丝血色。

"So, he was mad at something Asuka had no control over because it would make him look bad? How utterly awful!" Rei realized, her voice raising ever so slightly. Shinji and Misato were shocked at how much emotion Rei had just shown, If anyone else would have heard Rei, they would have been surprised at how quietly she was taking it. For those that knew her, they knew that was as good as shouting at the top of her lungs.  
“所以，他对明日香无法控制的事情感到生气，因为这会让他看起来很糟糕？太糟糕了！”丽意识到了，她的声音微微提高了。真嗣和美里对丽刚刚表现出的如此多的情感感到震惊，如果其他人听到丽的话，他们会惊讶于她如此平静地接受它。对于那些认识她的人来说，他们知道这就像大声喊叫一样好。

"We need to air the room out," Shinji stated as he stood up once more and walked to the balcony door and slid it open. The smell of gunpowder was now very prominent, and it was an odor he didn't want in his home. Looking up toward the ceiling, he saw a small hole that had not been there previously. Once more, he seethed at how someone had walked into his home with a gun and wanted to take Asuka. He clinched his hand into a fist as he tried his best to force the anger back down.  
“我们需要让房间通风，”真嗣再次站起来，走到阳台门前，将其打开。火药味现在非常突出，这是他不想在家里出现的气味。抬头看向天花板，他看到了一个先前不存在的小洞。他再次对有人拿着枪走进他家并想要带走明日香感到愤怒。他握紧了拳头，努力将怒火压下去。

"Shinji, your hand," Rei called out as she walked over to her brother and took his injured hand, which just happened to be the one he was clinching. This is what drew Rei's attention to it.  
“真嗣，你的手。”丽走到哥哥身边，握住他受伤的手，而那只手恰好是他紧握的那只手。这也是引起雷伊注意的地方。

"It's just a scratch, Rei," Shinji said nonchalantly, cursing himself for drawing attention to it, "It'll be alright."  
“只是擦伤，丽，”真嗣漫不经心地说，咒骂自己引起了别人的注意，“不会有事的。”

"Bullshit, Shinji," Heidi replied as she, too, came over to look at the back of his hand. She turned it over as a scowl crossed her face. She noticed the little black spots all around the wound. "Take a look at this, Misato, and let me know what you think!"  
“胡说，真嗣。”海蒂回答道，同时也走过来看着他的手背。她把它翻了过来，脸上掠过一丝愁容。她注意到伤口周围有一些小黑点。 “美里，看看这个，然后告诉我你的想法！”

"I think," Misato added, "that Shinji is a very lucky guy!" She quickly slapped him on the back of the head and wrapped him up in one of her hugs. "What the hell possessed you to do something like that?"  
“我认为，”美里补充道，“真嗣是一个非常幸运的人！”她迅速拍了拍他的后脑勺，然后将他搂在怀里。 “到底是什么让你做出这样的事？”

"Like what?" he asked innocently, but he knew the older ladies were not going to fall for it. Both crossed their arms and cocked an eyebrow at his poor attempt at subterfuge. Rei looked confused once more.  
“像什么？”他天真地问道，但他知道年长的女士们不会上当的。两人交叉双臂，对他拙劣的诡计挑起眉毛。雷再次露出困惑的表情。

"Those are powder burns, Shinji! That damn bullet grazed your hand when you slapped the gun out of Dr. Soryu's hand!" Misato barked as Shinji cringed, hoping Asuka wouldn't wake up and hear what was going on. Rei reached over and slapped Shinji on the back of his head and glared at him, making him feel worse than he already did.  
“那是火药烧伤，真嗣！当你从苍龙博士手中夺走枪时，那该死的子弹擦伤了你的手！”美里大叫，真嗣畏缩起来，希望明日香不会醒来并听到发生了什么事。丽伸手拍了拍真嗣的后脑勺，怒视着他，这让他感觉更糟了。

"Look, I'm sorry! But can we keep it down? I don't need Asuka to hear all this!" he apologized as he rubbed the back of his head, casting a look at his sister. Her crimson eyes stared back at him in reproach. "I saw danger and just reacted! I don't know what happened, okay?"  
“听着，我很抱歉！但是我们能小声点吗？我不需要明日香听到这一切！”他一边道歉一边揉着后脑勺，看了一眼妹妹。她猩红的眼睛责备地回望着他。 “我看到危险了才反应过来！我不知道发生了什么事情好吗？”

"Berserker," Rei muttered as she gave her brother a hug, realizing how close she just came to losing him. Shinji sighed in frustration as he returned her hug before Heidi grabbed his hand and lead him to the kitchen to clean up his wound.  
“狂战士，”丽低声说道，拥抱了她的哥哥，意识到自己差一点就要失去他了。真嗣沮丧地叹了口气，回应了她的拥抱，海蒂抓住他的手，带他去厨房清理伤口。

"That was a very brave thing you did, Shinji," the redhead whispered to him as she cleaned the wound with alcohol, causing him to wince in pain, "stupid, but brave!"  
“真嗣，你做了一件非常勇敢的事，”红发女郎一边用酒精清理伤口，一边低声对他说道，让他痛苦地皱起了眉头，“愚蠢，但勇敢！”

"I'm sorry," he stammered, his face turning red at both the compliment and rebuke, "it's like I didn't even think about what could happen, I just saw Asuka get hurt and saw a threat to my family. I just reacted." Heidi cracked a smile before shaking her head in amazement.  
“对不起，”他结结巴巴地说，无论是赞美还是责备，他的脸都红了，“就好像我根本没有考虑会发生什么，我只是看到明日香受伤，看到了对我家人的威胁。我才反应过来。”海蒂绽开笑容，然后惊讶地摇摇头。

"I knew you loved Asuka before," she said as she covered his injury with antibiotic ointment and placed a bandage upon that, "but I swear, in all my years in the _Bundeswehr_ and then the NERV security forces, I have _never_ seen anyone move like that before! You disarmed Sonya, punched her out of the way, and had Erik pinned to the ground as fast as I could blink! How in the hell did you learn such moves?"  
“我知道你以前爱过明日香，”她一边说，一边用抗生素软膏覆盖他的伤口，并在上面缠上绷带，“但我发誓，在我在联邦国防军和NERV安全部队的这些年里，我从未见过任何人你以前就是这样动作的！你解除了索尼娅的武装，一拳打倒了她，并且以我眨眼的速度把埃里克按倒在地！你到底是怎么学会这样的动作的？”

"Piloting EVA, I guess," Shinji shrugged, not to happy with the fact he could perform acts of violence like that without really even thinking, "Some of those Angels could move rather quickly, so I had to learn how to move Unit One faster. I guess it's a lot easier to move fast with my own body, rather than with a fifty-story cyborg." Heidi just shook her head in disbelief as she finished patching him up.  
“我想，驾驶EVA吧，”真嗣耸耸肩，对自己可以不假思索地做出这样的暴力行为感到不高兴，“其中一些天使的移动速度相当快，所以我必须学习如何移动一号机我想用我自己的身体快速移动比用五十层楼高的机器人要容易得多。”当海蒂给他包扎完毕时，她难以置信地摇摇头。

"Well, good job! I guess I shouldn't have to worry about whether or not you can defend Asuka from now on," she replied as she stood up and placed a small kiss on his forehead. "I said it before, and I'll say it again: You're a special guy, Shinji Ikari!" Shinji blushed as he mumbled his thanks and went back to the living room to calm his guardian and sister down before he could retire for the night and look after Asuka. As he walked in, he saw Misato putting the phone down with a worried look on her face.  
“嗯，干得好！我想，从现在开始，我就不用再担心你能否保护明日香了。”她站起来，在他的额头上印下一吻。 “我之前说过，现在我再说一遍：你是一个特别的人，碇真司！”真嗣脸红了，低声说了声谢谢，然后回到客厅让他的监护人和妹妹平静下来，然后他就可以睡觉去照顾明日香了。一进门，就看到美里放下电话，一脸担忧。

"Well, Shinji, we have a meeting first thing tomorrow with your…uh…the Commander," Misato stated as she plopped herself down on the sofa, sighing heavily. "Here it was I was looking forward to a quiet Sunday, too!" Shinji grimaced at the look on Misato's face. He really hated it when Misato doesn't get her days off, especially if he's the reason for it.  
“好吧，真嗣，我们明天第一件事就是要和你的……呃……指挥官开会。”美里说着，她一屁股坐在沙发上，重重地叹了口气。 “我也期待着一个安静的周日！”真嗣看着美里的表情，皱起了眉头。他真的很讨厌美里不请假，尤其是如果他是原因的话。

"I'm sorry, Misato," he apologized as he sat back down himself, feeling deflated. "I screwed up, didn't I?"  
“对不起，美里。”他一边道歉一边坐回座位，感到泄气。 “我搞砸了，不是吗？”

"No sweat, Shinji!" she replied, shaking her head in resignation, "To tell you the truth, you showed more restraint than I would have, I would have shot the bastard."  
“别担心，真嗣！”她无奈地摇着头回答道：“说实话，你比我表现得更克制，我早就开枪打死那个混蛋了。”

"Should I attend as well, Major?" Rei asked, ready to do her part in protecting her brother and future sister-in-law. Misato rolled her eyes at the sound of her rank. She still had a long way to go to get Rei to act like a real human more often.  
“我也应该参加吗，少校？”丽问道，准备尽自己的一份力量来保护她的哥哥和未来的嫂子。听到自己的军衔，美里翻了个白眼。要让丽更多地表现得像个真正的人，她还有很长的路要走。

"No, that's alright Rei. No reason for all of us to be miserable. The Commander requested Conan over there and myself," Misato replied as she motioned toward Shinji, who turned three shades of red at what she had called him. Heidi came back in with a twinkle in her eye, having heard the last comment.  
“不，没关系，丽。我们大家没有理由感到痛苦。指挥官请柯南和我一起去。”美里回答道，她指着真嗣，真嗣因她的称呼而脸色红了三度。听到最后一句话，海蒂回来了，眼睛里闪烁着光芒。

"I thought he was The Berserker, not The Barbarian," Heidi teased as Shinji's face got hotter and hotter still.  
“我以为他是狂战士，而不是野蛮人，”海蒂调侃道，真嗣的脸越来越热。

"_Aw crap! Here it comes!"_ he thought as the two older women started revving up the Tease Machine.  
“噢糟糕！来了！”当两个年长的女人开始加速调情机时，他这样想。

"Feh! Berserker, Barbarian, close enough!" Misato added as she got Shinji in a headlock and ruffled up his hair. Rei watched the whole thing with a small smile on her face as Shinji finally extracted himself and leapt off the couch before anything else could happen.  
“呸！狂战士，野蛮人，够近了！”美里一边补充道，一边将真嗣的头锁住，并弄乱了他的头发。丽带着微笑看着整个过程，真嗣最终从沙发上站了起来，在其他事情发生之前跳了下来。

"I'm going to bed before you two can come up with anything else to try to tease me about," he said as he walked over and gave his sister a small kiss on her forehead before heading back to his room. Rei blushed somewhat but felt warm at how her brother treated her.  
“在你们两个想出任何其他东西来取笑我之前，我要睡觉了，”他一边说，一边走过去，在妹妹的额头上轻轻吻了一下，然后回到了自己的房间。丽有点脸红，但对哥哥对待她的方式感到温暖。

"Oh, you mean like how you were watching Asuka's butt the other day when she walked back to the kitchen?" Misato queried as he stopped in mid-step and shook his head. He knew that was going to come back to bite him.  
“哦，你是说那天明日香走回厨房时你看着她的屁股？”美里停下脚步，摇摇头问道。他知道那会回来咬他。

"Really? I hadn't heard about that!" Heidi piped in as she saw Shinji's ears turn red, though his back was still to them. The Teasing Twins giggled at his reaction.  
“真的吗？我没听说过！”海蒂插话道，她看到真嗣的耳朵变红了，尽管他仍然背对着耳朵。戏弄双胞胎对他的反应咯咯地笑。

_"Time to turn the tables,"_ he thought as he turned around with a small smile on his lips. "Well, I couldn't help it, she was wiggling it just for me. It would have been very rude of me if I didn't stare! Besides, it was just a butt wiggle. With you two here, I guess it could have been much worse!" The shocked looks on their faces was priceless.  
“是时候扭转局面了。”他一边想，一边转过身来，嘴角挂着一丝微笑。 “好吧，我没办法，她只是为了我才扭动它。如果我不盯着看，那就太无礼了！而且，这只是扭动屁股。你们两个在这儿，我猜是这样的。”情况可能会更糟！”他们脸上震惊的表情是无价的。

"What the hell does that mean?!" they demanded in perfect stereo as Shinji laughed evilly then disappeared down the hall and into his and Asuka's room. They spun in unison as they heard a small giggle coming from Rei as she stood and excused herself for the evening and left for her apartment, leaving a pair of miffed ladies still standing in the room, fuming.  
“这到底意味着什么？！”他们用完美的立体声问道，真嗣邪恶地笑了一声，然后消失在走廊里，走进了他和明日香的房间。他们齐刷刷地转过身来，听到丽起身告辞，准备回自己的公寓时发出一阵咯咯的笑声，留下两位生气的女士仍然站在房间里，气愤不已。

"He's really opened up, hasn't he?" Heidi asked, remembering the insecure and stuttering boy she had gotten to know in the past.  
“他真的很开放，不是吗？”海蒂问道，想起了她过去认识的那个缺乏安全感、口吃的男孩。

"They all three have," Misato agreed, before she and Heidi both retired to their rooms to get a good night's rest.  
“他们三个都有，”美里同意道，然后她和海蒂都回到自己的房间好好休息一晚。

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was about two a.m. when Shinji awoke and got up to answer nature's call and to get a drink of water. Asuka had slept like a log all night, not even stirring when Shinji had climbed into bed several hours ago. That all changed when Shinji got back to the room, as he heard soft sobs coming from the redhead in his bed. Awakening fully in a heartbeat, he crossed the room in a flash and quickly climbed into bed and took the love of his life in his arms and rocked her gently.  
凌晨两点左右，真嗣醒来，起身去喝水。明日香整晚都睡得很熟，几个小时前真嗣爬上床的时候甚至没有动一下。当真嗣回到房间时，一切都改变了，他听到床上的红发女郎发出轻柔的抽泣声。他猛地惊醒，一闪就穿过房间，迅速爬上床，将他一生所爱的人抱在怀里，轻轻地摇晃着。

"It's alright Asuka," he murmured as he held her close and comforted her as best he could, "I'm here."  
“没事的，明日香，”他低声说道，紧紧地抱住她，尽力安慰她，“我在这儿。”

"Papa…" she cried, her eyes still closed, though huge tears slipped through. Shinji continued to hold her and whisper to her, occasionally stroking her silky hair. After many minutes, she finally calmed down and relaxed enough to fall back to a restful slumber. Shinji had seen this before, the first time being when they had started living together to train to defeat the Seventh Angel. However, the time he remembered the most was after she had awakened from her coma. It was the first time had had ever held the fiery German known as Asuka…..  
“爸爸……”她哭着，眼睛仍然闭着，但大颗大颗的泪水滑落下来。真嗣继续抱着她，对她低声说话，时不时地抚摸她柔滑的头发。过了好几分钟，她终于平静下来，放松下来，重新进入了梦乡。真嗣以前见过这种情况，第一次是在他们开始共同生活并训练打败第七天使时。不过，他记得最清楚的，还是她从昏迷中醒来之后。这是第一次拥抱火热的德国人明日香……

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Early 2016. 2016 年初。_

A month had passed since Shinji had slain the Seventeenth Angel, and Asuka had finally awakened. While Shinji was ever so slowly overcoming his guilt at having to kill Karou, Asuka wasn't making much progress at all.  
距离真嗣杀死第十七天使已经过去了一个月，明日香也终于苏醒了。虽然真嗣慢慢地克服了必须杀死卡鲁的负罪感，但明日香却没有取得太大进展。

Most times, she would just stare off into space, lost in the recesses of her own mind. Nighttime wasn't much better, as more often than not she would wake up screaming in the middle of the night from some terror or another. It tore at Shinji's heart to hear her screams. He knew Asuka hated him, but he still cared for the formerly feisty young German. Most nights, he would bury his head under his pillow, not knowing what to do to help. Eventually, the screaming would stop, followed by much quieter sobs. One night changed all that, though. It occurred in a dream, or so Shinji thought.  
大多数时候，她只是凝视着太空，迷失在自己的内心深处。晚上也好不了多少，因为她常常会在半夜因某种恐惧而尖叫着醒来。听到真嗣的尖叫声，她的心撕裂了。他知道明日香讨厌他，但他仍然关心这个曾经活泼的德国年轻人。大多数晚上，他都会把头埋在枕头下，不知道该怎么办。最终，尖叫声会停止，随之而来的是更加安静的抽泣。然而，一个晚上改变了这一切。这发生在梦中，至少真嗣是这么想的。

_"Hello Shinji,"_ a strange voice called out to him in his dreamscape.  
“你好，真嗣。”一个奇怪的声音在他的梦境中喊道。

_"Who…who's there?"_ Shinji stammered as he looked around the mist-shrouded landscape before him. Shinji really didn't like this place, all the ground was completely covered with mist, with strange, twisted dark trees sprouting from the middle of nowhere. He felt like he was floating in a strange, dark storm cloud. He shivered violently and did his best to keep from running away.  
“谁……谁在那儿？”真嗣环顾眼前雾气缭绕的景象，结结巴巴地说。真嗣实在不喜欢这个地方，地面完全被雾气覆盖，不知道什么地方长出了奇怪、扭曲的黑色树木。他感觉自己漂浮在一片奇怪的、黑暗的暴风雨云中。他剧烈地颤抖着，竭力不让自己逃跑。

_"Forgotten me already? How sad…"_ the voice called out once more as a figure started to form and stand out from the surrounding mist.  
“都忘了我了吗？太悲伤了……”声音再次响起，一道人影从周围的雾气中浮现出来。

_"Karou?"_ Shinji asked as he recognized the gray-haired young man. _"How? I thought you were dead!"_ Relief started to wash over Shinji at the thought his friend was alive and well, even though it was in this twisted landscape.  
“卡鲁？”真嗣认出了灰发青年，问道。 “怎么？我还以为你死了呢！”想到他的朋友还活着并且安然无恙，即使是在这片扭曲的风景中，真嗣还是松了口气。

_"I am,"_ Karou replied, smiling serenely, _" but I still exist, in a fashion, within your mind."_  
“是的，”卡鲁平静地微笑着回答，“但在某种程度上，我仍然存在于你的脑海中。”

_"Mental contamination?!?"_ Shinji squawked as he stumbled back away from Karou. The brief relief he had just felt seconds ago abruptly vanished as his fear over took him.  
“精神污染？！？”真嗣大叫一声，跌跌撞撞地从卡鲁身边退开。几秒钟前他刚刚感受到的短暂轻松突然消失了，因为他的恐惧笼罩了他。

_"No, Shinji. Nothing so crude as that,"_ Karou continued. _"I respect and care for you too much to do anything like that. As an Angel, I have certain abilities that you Lilim do not. I am merely the shadow of the Karou that you knew in life. Through me, Karou can speak to you briefly, even though he no longer resides on the physical plane."_ Understanding seemed to briefly flash through Shinji's mind.  
“不，真嗣。没有比这更粗鲁的事情了，”卡鲁继续说道。 “我非常尊重和关心你，所以不会做那样的事情。作为天使，我拥有莉莉姆所没有的某些能力。我只是你生前所认识的卡鲁的影子。通过我，卡鲁可以与你交谈尽管他不再居住在物质层面，但你还是短暂地与你见面。”真嗣的脑海中似乎闪过一丝理解。

_"So, you're not invading my mind, like the Fifteenth did to Asuka?"_ Shinji asked, praying that the answer would be a good one. He wasn't disappointed.  
“所以，你没有侵入我的思想，就像第十五对明日香所做的那样？”真嗣问道，祈祷能得到一个好的答案。他并没有失望。

_"No. In fact, the only reason we can truly speak now is that I can feel your pain and heartache even from here. I have come back briefly this one time to do what I can to help."_ Karou replied as he stopped before Shinji. _"So, tell me, what causes you such pain?"_  
“不。事实上，我们现在能真正说话的唯一原因是，即使在这里，我也能感受到你的痛苦和心痛。我这次短暂回来，是为了尽我所能来帮助你。”卡鲁在真嗣面前停下来回答道。 “那么，告诉我，是什么让你如此痛苦？”

_"Simpler question might be what doesn't,"_ Shinji mumbled as he shook his head and stared down a his feet, watching the swirling mist envelope them.  
“更简单的问题可能是什么不是，”真嗣咕哝道，他摇着头，低头凝视着自己的脚，看着旋转的雾气笼罩着它们。

_"Indeed. Let me guess: you feel guilty over my death?"_ Karou replied with a sad smile. Shinji nodded ever so slightly.  
“确实如此。让我猜猜：你对我的死感到内疚吗？”卡鲁带着悲伤的微笑回答道。真嗣轻轻地点了点头。

_"Yeah. I should have died, not you,"_ Shinji stated as tears started to fall, turning to wisps as they caused the mists to rise up to his knees_. "You were a much better person than I am."_ The Angel shook it's head sadly.  
“是的。我应该死，而不是你，”真嗣说道，泪水开始落下，化为缕缕，雾气升到了他的膝盖处。 “你是一个比我好得多的人。”天使悲伤地摇摇头。

_"Shinji, I wasn't a person. I'm an Angel, as you Lilim call us. I chose the manner of my death. Sparing me would have cost the lives of everyone you hold dear. It would have destroyed humanity."_ Karou placed his hand on Shinji's shoulder, causing the young man to look up into his bright red eyes. _"You did the right thing. I asked you to destroy me, remember?"_  
“真嗣，我不是一个人。我是一个天使，就像莉莉姆对我们的称呼一样。我选择了自己的死亡方式。放过我就会牺牲你所珍视的每个人的生命。这会毁灭人类。”卡鲁将手搭在真嗣的肩膀上，年轻人抬起头，看到了他那双鲜红的眼睛。 “你做对了。我让你毁掉我，记得吗？”

_"Yeah, I guess. But that doesn't make it any easier."_ Shinji mumbled as the mists seemed to retreat somewhat. _"I'm sorry."_  
“是的，我想。但这并没有让事情变得更容易。”真嗣嘟哝了一句，雾气似乎退去一些。 “对不起。”

_"There's nothing to be sorry about, Shinji! You were my only true friend, and knowing you brightened my existence."_ Karou answered as light began to radiated about his form. "_In truth, killing me was probably the kindest thing you could have ever done for me, Shinji. Being stuck in that mortal shell was extremely painful, I don't see how you Lilim are able to stand it."_  
“没有什么可遗憾的，真嗣！你是我唯一真正的朋友，认识你让我的生活变得光明。”卡鲁回答道，他的身体周围开始散发出光芒。 「说实话，杀了我可能是你能为我做的最仁慈的事了，真嗣。被困在凡人的躯壳里是极其痛苦的，我不明白莉莉姆你如何能够忍受。」

_"Some of us can't,"_ Shinji sighed as an image of Asuka flashed before him. Karou was quick to notice this, even as the amount of mist started to increase once more.  
“我们有些人做不到，”当明日香的影像在他面前闪现时，真嗣叹了口气。卡鲁很快就注意到了这一点，尽管雾气的量再次开始增加。

_"You care for her very deeply, don't you?"_ Karou asked, a serene smile once more upon his face.  
“你很关心她，不是吗？”卡鲁问道，脸上再次露出平静的笑容。

_"Yeah, I always have. I can't help it, but it's of no use. She hates me."_ Shinji replied sadly, his heart aching more now than ever before. The pain tore through Karou like a knife.  
“是啊，我一直都有。我没办法，但也没用。她恨我。”真嗣悲伤地回答道，他的心比以往任何时候都更痛。疼痛像刀子一样撕裂了卡鲁。

_"Are you so sure?"_ Karou asked, as images of Asuka started flittering before him. Each and every one of them were either insulting or striking Shinji. The loudest one was of her screaming that she hated him. The mists closed up even faster and thicker.  
“你这么确定？”卡鲁问道，明日香的影像开始在他面前闪现。他们每一个都不是在侮辱就是在攻击真嗣。最响亮的是她尖叫着说她恨他。雾气闭合得更快、更浓。

_"See what I mean?"_ Shinji asked sadly, tears once more threatening to fall from his blue eyes. Eyes that no longer shined with life, but were dulled with despair.  
“明白了吗？”真嗣悲伤地问道，泪水再次从他的蓝眼睛里流下来。那双眼睛不再闪烁着生命的光芒，而是充满了绝望。

_"Sorry to tell you this, Shinji, but you have it all wrong!"_ Karou said as he circled through all the Asukas in Shinji's mind_. "Asuka really likes you, the only person she really hates is herself. She hates herself for her perceived weakness, and she hates herself for the way she treats others, especially you. I can let you have a peek into her mind, if you wish."_  
“很抱歉告诉你这个，真嗣，但你完全错了！”卡鲁一边说道，一边在真嗣的脑海中盘旋着所有的飞鸟。 “明日香真的很喜欢你，她唯一真正讨厌的人就是她自己。她讨厌自己的弱点，她讨厌自己对待别人的方式，尤其是你。我可以让你看看她的想法，如果你希望。”

_"NO!!"_ Shinji yelled, extremely offended and causing the mists that had surrounded him to disperse. _"I could NEVER do that to Asuka, especially after what has happened to her! That would be the ultimate betrayal!"_  
“不！！”真嗣极为愤怒地大喊一声，让周围的雾气散去。 “我永远不能对明日香这样做，尤其是在她发生了那件事之后！那将是最终的背叛！”

_"I knew you would turn down the offer, Shinji,"_ Karou replied as he placed his hand once more upon Shinji's shoulder_. "You are too nice of a guy and too good of a friend to do that, and you care for her too much to hurt her like that!"_  
“我就知道你会拒绝这个提议，真嗣。”卡鲁回答道，他的手再次搭在真嗣的肩膀上。 “你是一个太好的人了，一个太好的朋友了，你不会这么做，而且你太关心她了，不会那样伤害她！”

_"She hurts so much, Karou, and there is nothing I can do!"_ Shinji cried as an image of Asuka fell to the ground, curled up and sobbed uncontrollably.  
“卡鲁，她伤得很重，我却无能为力！”真嗣哭了，明日香的影像倒在地上，蜷缩成一团，无法控制地抽泣。

_"Be there for her, Shinji, just as you always have been,"_ the gray-haired Angel replied as he gently guided Shinji to the crying girl_. "Go to her. Hold her. Be there for her."_  
“在她身边，真嗣，就像你一直以来一样。”灰发天使一边回答，一边温柔地引导真嗣走向哭泣的女孩。 “走到她身边。抱住她。陪在她身边。”

_"She'll kill me,"_ replied Shinji, as his steps slowed more and more the closer he got to the sobbing girl. Karou smiled.  
“她会杀了我。”真嗣回答道，他的脚步越接近哭泣的女孩，就越慢。卡鲁笑了。

_"Could you ask for a more glorious death?"_ Karou asked, chuckling a little. The shocked look on Shinji's face was priceless, but it was a manifestation of his fear, and this was something the Angel was trying to overcome.  
“你能要求一个更光荣的死法吗？”卡鲁微微一笑，问道。真嗣脸上的震惊表情是无价的，但这是他恐惧的表现，而这正是天使试图克服的。

_"No, she won't kill you. Asuka needs you, Shinji, just as much as your sister needs you, and your guardian needs you. It is time to throw off the shackles of The Coward and allow The Man to stand up, strong and proud,"_ Karou continued as he lead Shinji the rest of the way. Chains appeared and wrapped themselves around Shinji's ankles just before he reached the young German. With no warning, his feet were yanked out from under him, causing him to land on his face and sprawl out among the mist, which quickly closed over him, shrouding his sight.  
“不，她不会杀你。明日香需要你，真嗣，就像你的妹妹需要你，你的守护者需要你一样。是时候摆脱胆小鬼的束缚，让男人站起来了，坚强而骄傲。”卡鲁一边继续带领着真嗣走完剩下的路。就在真嗣接近这位年轻的德国人之前，锁链出现并缠住了真嗣的脚踝。毫无征兆地，他的双脚被从身下猛地抽出，导致他脸朝下，四肢摊开在雾气中，雾气很快就将他笼罩住，遮住了他的视线。

_"What the hell?"_ he demanded as he rolled over and looked for the source of the chains. Despite the shrouding mists, he stared off into the distance and saw someone holding the other ends. Much to his surprise, it was a copy of himself, pale, violently shaking, and pulling Shinji toward him with inhuman strength. _"What are you doing?"_  
“我勒个去？”他翻身寻找锁链的来源，问道。尽管雾气缭绕，他还是凝视着远方，看到有人握住了另一端。令他惊讶的是，那是他自己的复制品，脸色苍白，剧烈颤抖，用非人的力量将真嗣拉向他。 “你在干什么？”

_"Saving you from yourself,"_ stammered back a reply as The Coward continued to drag Shinji further into the mists and further away from Asuka.  
“救你脱离你自己。”胆小鬼结结巴巴地回答道，同时继续把真嗣拖进迷雾中，远离明日香。

_"I have to help Asuka!"_ Shinji yelled as he clawed at the ground and tried to dig his heels into the surface. The ground was soft, and any attempt to stop his progress was met with failure.  
“我必须帮助明日香！”真嗣大叫一声，用爪子抓着地面，试图将脚后跟踩进地面。地面很软，任何阻止他前进的尝试都以失败告终。

_"No! She'll only hurt us!"_ The Coward screeched back, pulling even harder. Shinji slid even more as he scrambled for some sort of purchase with which to fight the specter before him.  
“不！她只会伤害我们！”胆小鬼尖叫着向后退去，拉得更用力了。当真嗣争先恐后地寻找某种东西来对抗面前的幽灵时，他的身子滑得更厉害了。

_"That doesn't matter now! I have to help Asuka!"_ Shinji growled through gritted teeth as he tried desperately to make his way back to the ever sobbing girl_. "Karou! Help me!"_  
“现在没关系！我必须帮助明日香！”真嗣咬牙切齿地咆哮着，拼命想回到那个一直抽泣的女孩身边。 “卡鲁！救救我！”

_"I cannot, Shinji. This is a battle you must win for yourself,"_ the albino Angel replied as he looked at Shinji with sad eyes. He stood next to the fallen form of the Second Child, who looked worse and worse.  
“我不能，真嗣。这是一场你必须为自己赢得胜利的战斗。”白化天使用悲伤的眼神看着真嗣说道。他站在倒下的老二旁边，老二看上去越来越糟。

_"Come on! We have to hide! We must run away!"_ The Coward screamed as he pulled with renewed vigor. Asuka's cries became more and more desperate, rending Shinji's heart to shreds.  
“快点！我们必须躲起来！我们必须逃走！”胆小鬼一边用新的活力拉着，一边尖叫着。明日香的哭声越来越绝望，真嗣的心都被撕裂了。

_"No! Damn it! I…have…to…help…Asuka!"_ Shinji growled even louder, punctuating each word with a surge of power as he was finally able to reach down and take hold of the chains surrounding his ankles. He could feel the berserker rage starting to fall upon him, and he was going to use it to the best of his ability.  
“不！该死！我……必须……帮助……明日香！”真嗣咆哮得更大声，每一个字都充满了力量，他终于能够伸手抓住脚踝上的锁链。他能感觉到狂暴之怒开始降临在他身上，他将尽自己最大的努力来使用它。

_"Yes, we do,"_ replied yet another voice. Shinji turned and saw an idealized version of himself, fully grown, clad in purple and green armour, and riding a pale horse. Dismounting, he walked over to Shinji's side as he, too, took hold of the binding chains. Together, Shinji and The Man gave a mighty tug, sending The Coward flying back toward them.  
“是的，我们愿意。”另一个声音回答道。真嗣转过身来，看到了理想化的自己，完全长大了，穿着紫色和绿色的盔甲，骑着一匹苍白的马。他下了马，走到真嗣身边，也抓住了束缚链。真嗣和男人一起用力一拉，胆小鬼就飞回了他们身边。

_"No, no, no, no, no, no,"_ stammered the Coward, _"You can't make me! They'll only hurt us! We can't stand that!"_ He gathered the chains up once more and started to pull, to no avail.  
“不，不，不，不，不，不，”胆小鬼结结巴巴地说，“你不能逼我！他们只会伤害我们！我们受不了！”他再次收起铁链并开始拉动，但无济于事。

_"Yes, we can,"_ Shinji and The Man said in unison, "_We may get hurt, or we may not. We have to show openness and compassion if we are to consider ourselves human beings and not beasts of the field."_ With each word, they drew closer and closer to Asuka.  
“是的，我们可以，”真嗣和那个男人异口同声地说，“我们可能会受伤，也可能不会。如果我们要把自己视为人类而不是野兽，我们就必须表现出开放和同情心。”每说一句话，他们就离明日香越来越近。

_"NO!!!"_ cried The Coward, his eyes wide and desperate.  
“不！！！”胆小鬼大声喊道，他的眼睛睁得大大的，充满了绝望。

_"YES!!!!"_ Shinji yelled, with a mighty pull. Suddenly, the chains fell from his ankles.  
“是的！！！！”真嗣大喊一声，用力拉力。突然，锁链从他的脚踝上掉了下来。

_"Go, Shinji,"_ The Man said as he held on to the chains, keeping The Coward from fleeing. _"Go now to yon damsel, I shall deal with this lout!"_ Shinji looked once more to Asuka, who was now clad in a red medieval gown rather than her plug suit, but was still curled up and sobbing. He ran to her and fell upon his knees. Drawing her up into his arms, he held her gently as her sobbing slowed.  
“走吧，真嗣。”男人一边说，一边抓住铁链，阻止胆小鬼逃跑。 “你去吧，姑娘，我来对付这个混蛋！”真嗣再次看向明日香，她现在穿着红色的中世纪长袍，而不是紧身衣，但仍然蜷缩着哭泣。他跑到她身边，跪倒在地。他将她拉进怀里，温柔地抱住她，她的抽泣声渐渐慢了下来。

_"I'm sorry I wasn't there for you, Asuka,"_ he said as he stroked her hair, _" but I'm here now…"_  
“很抱歉我没有在你身边，明日香，”他一边抚摸着她的头发，一边说道，“但我现在就在这里……”

Shinji awoke with a start, as Asuka's sobs grew worse. _"Go to her,"_ he heard Karou say as he bolted from his bed and out of his room. He didn't stop to think or feel sad that he would never hear his friend's voice again, the only thing that mattered was being there for Asuka.  
真嗣猛地惊醒，明日香的抽泣声越来越厉害。 “去找她，”他听见卡鲁说，他从床上跳了起来，冲出了房间。他没有停下来思考，也没有因为再也听不到朋友的声音而感到悲伤，唯一重要的是陪伴在明日香身边。

Entering her room, he saw her balled up on her bed, crying uncontrollably. He quickly crossed over to her bed, sat beside her and pulled her into his arms. Asuka instinctively wrapped her arms around Shinji and held on as if her life depended on it. Her sobs slowly tapered off, as Shinji continued to hold and rock her, whispering to her that everything was alright. Finally, she fell into a deep, dreamless sleep. However, just before doing so, she opened her eyes just a bit and seemed a bit startled at what she saw.  
进了她的房间，就看到她趴在床上，失声痛哭。他快步走到她床边，坐在她身边，将她拉进怀里。明日香本能地用双臂抱住真嗣，仿佛她的生命就在于此。她的抽泣声慢慢减弱，真嗣继续抱着她摇晃她，低声对她说一切都好。最后，她陷入了沉沉的睡眠，无梦。然而，就在这之前，她睁开了眼睛，似乎对眼前的景象感到有些惊讶。

"Shinji?" she whispered as sleep finally overcame her and she slept in his arms. Shinji, for his part, did not wish to disturb her, so he remained there the rest of the night, sitting with his back against the wall and holding her, driving off her nightmares, and allowing her to relax for the first time in so very long.  
“真嗣？”她低声说道，睡意终于征服了她，她在他的怀里睡着了。真嗣则不想打扰她，所以整个晚上他都留在那里，背靠着墙坐着，抱着她，赶走了她的噩梦，让她第一次在这样的环境中放松下来。很长。

The next morning, Asuka stirred as she slowly started to wake, needing to go to the bathroom. Without even thinking, she hugged the young man in her bed, slid out of his arms and retreated to the bathroom. When she finally came out, she was a little more awake, and didn't even notice that her bed was now empty, but made up and ready for her to go back to sleep. Shinji was no longer there, and she would have passed it off as a strange dream if she hadn't felt the warm place where he had sat up all night with her.  
第二天早上，明日香慢慢醒来，需要去洗手间。她想也没想，一把抱住了床上的少年，从他的怀里挣脱出来，退到了浴室。终于出来的时候，她稍微清醒了一些，甚至没有注意到自己的床已经空了，只是收拾好准备回去睡觉。真嗣已经不在了，如果不是感受到他和她一起坐了一夜的那个温暖的地方，她会把这当作一个奇怪的梦。

Gently padding into his room, she saw the exhausted young man collapsed upon his own bed, sleeping heavily on his own covers. With a strange look on her face, she crossed over to his bed and pulled the covers over him the best that she could without waking him. She ever so gently caressed the side of his face, as a tear slid down her cheek and landed on his pillow.  
轻轻地走进他的房间，她看到疲惫的年轻人倒在自己的床上，在自己的被子上沉沉地睡着。她脸上带着奇怪的表情，走到他的床边，尽可能地在不吵醒他的情况下为他盖上被子。她轻轻地抚摸着他的侧脸，一滴泪水顺着脸颊滑落，落在他的枕头上。

"Thank you," whispered Asuka, so as not to wake Shinji, before she bent down and kissed his forehead. Straightening up, she left his room and quietly closed his door and went back to her own bed. Neither she nor Shinji ever spoke of that night, but after that the night terrors were mostly kept at bay by the thought of the young man right next door. It was the terrors that attacked in daytime that were the hardest to ward off, but she soon learned how to stop those, as well…..  
“谢谢你。”明日香低声说道，以免吵醒真嗣，然后她弯下腰亲吻了他的额头。她直起身子，离开了他的房间，悄悄地关上了门，回到了自己的床上。她和真嗣都没有提起过那个夜晚，但从那以后，一想到隔壁的年轻人，夜惊就基本上消失了。最难抵御的是白天袭击的恐怖，但她很快也学会了如何阻止它们……

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Sunday morning… 周日上午…_

"Good Morning, Soryu," Commander Ikari called out somewhat pleasantly from behind his desk. For once, he was sitting up straight in his chair with his hands clasped together on the desktop. Commander Fuyutsuki stood behind him as was the norm, not saying a word or betraying any feeling of any sort.  
“早上好，苍龙。”碇中尉在办公桌后面有些愉快地喊道。这一次，他在椅子上坐直了身子，双手合十放在桌面上。冬月指挥官一如既往地站在他身后，没有说话，也没有流露出任何感情。

"Ikari," Erik Soryu growled back, a look of sheer disgust on his rather unpleasant face. He was a bit disturbed by what seemed to be the lack of seriousness coming from the Commander.  
“Ikari，”Erik Soryu 咆哮着回应，他相当不愉快的脸上露出了纯粹的厌恶表情。他对指挥官似乎缺乏严肃性的态度感到有点不安。

"To what do we owe the pleasure of this visit?" Ikari asked, knowing full well what had caused this meeting, and knowing that his attitude toward Soryu was going to set the other man off.  
“我们为何能有这次愉快的访问？”碇问，他很清楚这次会面的原因，也知道他对苍龙的态度会激怒对方。

"You know full well what I'm doing here, so let's cut the crap and get down to it!" the German seethed as he watched a small smile form on the Commander's face. "I came here to visit my daughter, and your son attacked me without provication!" Fuyutsuki's eyebrow shot up on that one.  
“你很清楚我在这里做什么，所以我们少说废话，开始干吧！”当德国人看到指挥官脸上露出一丝笑容时，他勃然大怒。 “我来这里看望我的女儿，你儿子却无缘无故对我发起攻击！”冬月的眉毛扬起。

"Really? I have reports that state otherwise," Gendo replied as he tossed a small folder down on his desk. "Eyewitness testimony, sworn statements, recordings and such."  
“真的吗？我有报告说情况并非如此，”源堂一边回答，一边把一个小文件夹扔到了办公桌上。 “目击者证词、宣誓陈述、录音等等。”

"Bah! Bullshit and lies!" Soryu snarled, his face turning redder than his daughter's hair. "Whoever told you that wasn't there to see what happened, or were bullied into lying about what truly happened!"  
“呸！废话和谎言！”昴流咆哮道，他的脸比女儿的头发还要红。 “告诉你这件事的人并没有亲眼目睹发生了什么，或者是被胁迫而对真实发生的事情撒了谎！”

"So the statements from the Director of Operations and the Commander of Combat Groups were either false or coerced?" Gendo asked as he leaned forward and hid his face behind his hands, as was the norm. A small grin formed as he knew he had the German.  
“那么作战总监和战斗群司令的说法要么是虚假的，要么是胁迫的？”源堂像往常一样，身体前倾，用手捂住脸，问道。当他知道他抓住了德国人时，他露出了一丝笑容。

"They weren't even there!" barked Soryu, "There were no high ranking members of your staff present!"  
“他们根本就不在那儿！”苍龙咆哮道，“你们手下没有高级人员在场！”

"Wrong," called out a familiar female voice from out of the shadows behind the Commander. Soryu felt the hair on the back of his neck rising as he saw Major Katsuragi step out into the light and take her place beside Commander Fuyutsuki.  
“错了。”指挥官身后的阴影中传来一个熟悉的女声。当苍龙看到葛城少校走到灯光下，站在冬月中校身旁时，他感到脖子后面的汗毛都竖起来了。

"They were," another voice growled out, this time behind Soryu, and once more lost in the shadows. This voice made him want to wet his pants and run hiding, for it was the one that threatened to remove him from the current plane of exsistance the night before. Soryu slowly turned and watched Captain Shinji Ikari walk from the shadows and into the circle of light that surrounded him.  
“他们是。”另一个声音咆哮道，这次是在苍流身后，再次消失在阴影中。这个声音让他想尿裤子，赶紧躲起来，因为正是这个声音在前一天晚上威胁要把他从当前的存在位面带走。苍龙缓缓转过身，看着队长碇真司从阴影中走出来，走进了包围他的光圈。

"What…what are you talking about?" stammered Soryu, who was clearly very nervous being around the younger Ikari. "These two are clearly delusional! They were there, as was my daughter, the blue-haired freak that you call a pilot, and my former sister-in-law!" A growl from the younger Ikari made Soryu lose control of his bladder, if even for a second.  
“你……你在说什么？”苍龙结结巴巴地说，他显然在年轻的碇身边感到非常紧张。 “这两个人显然是妄想症！他们在那里，还有我的女儿、你们称之为飞行员的蓝发怪物，还有我的前嫂子！”年轻的碇的一声咆哮让苍龙失去了膀胱的控制，哪怕只有一秒钟。

"I would advise you from insulting the First Child, if I were you," Fuyutsuki spoke up for the first time, "She is the sister of the rather angry young gentleman behind you." Soryu's jaw dropped. What was said next floored him.  
“如果我是你，我会劝你不要侮辱老大。”冬月第一次开口说道，“她是你身后那位颇为愤怒的少爷的妹妹。”昴流的下巴都掉下来了。接下来的话让他大吃一惊。

"Allow me to introduce Major Katsuragi, Director of Operations, and Captain Ikari, Commander of Combat Groups. As such, their testimonies are given more credence than most," the elder Ikari said as he motioned to the reports before him. "Anything to add, Soryu?"  
“请允许我介绍一下行动总监葛城少校和战斗群司令碇上尉。因此，他们的证词比大多数人都更可信。”老碇指着面前的报告说道。 “还有什么要补充的吗，昴流？”

"That doesn't matter," Soryu recovered as he set his face in a scowl, "what matters right now is the fact they prevented me from taking my daughter home! They have no right to interfere in my parental duties!"  
“没关系，”苍流皱起眉头，恢复过来，“现在重要的是他们阻止我带女儿回家！他们没有权利干涉我为人父母的职责！”

"Actually, Soryu, you are the one who had no right to try to force the Second Child to go with you," Fuyutsuki replied as he produced another file, this one the personnel records for Asuka. Gendo nodded his head slightly.  
“事实上，苍龙，你没有权利试图强迫老二和你一起走。”冬月一边回答，一边拿出另一份文件，这份文件是明日香的人事记录。源堂微微点头。

"What the hell are you talking about?" Soryu barked, forgetting about the young man behind him.  
“你他妈在说什么？”苍龙大叫一声，忘记了身后的年轻人。

"The document here shows that when Asuka was chosen as a pilot, you willingly turned over guardianship of her to NERV. Something about how she and your new wife weren't getting along," answered Fuyutsuki, reading from the file before placing the document on the desk for Soryu to study. Storming forward, he snatched the paper up and gave it a quick read before throwing it back down.  
“这里的文件表明，当明日香被选为飞行员时，你自愿将她的监护权移交给NERV。关于她和你的新婚妻子相处得如何的一些事情，”冬月回答道，在放置文件之前阅读了文件放在桌子上供Soryu学习。他冲上前去，抓起那张纸，快速地读了一遍，然后又扔了回去。

"Bah! I'm reasserting my parental rights as of now, you're so called 'guardianship' of my daughter is at an end! She is going home today!" he said triumphantly, crossing his arms and non-verbally daring the others to contest it. He was dismayed to see Misato and Fuyutsuki smile slightly.  
“呸！我现在就重申我的父母权利，你所谓的对我女儿的‘监护权’就到此为止了！她今天就回家了！”他交叉着双臂，得意洋洋地说道，并无声地向其他人提出质疑。看到美里和冬月微微一笑，他感到有些沮丧。

"Unfortunately for you, this document here says otherwise. When your daughter turned thirteen and was being prepped to come over to Japan, you signed a paper that showed that you did not contest her petition for legal emancipation. Her emancipation documents are right here," Fuyutsuki added as he placed those documents on the desk as well. Once more, Soryu stormed forward and grabbed up the papers, this time turning deathly white as he placed them back down.  
“对你来说不幸的是，这里的这份文件另有说明。当你女儿十三岁准备来日本时，你签署了一份文件，表明你没有对她的合法解放请愿书提出异议。她的解放文件就在这里， ”冬月一边补充道，一边将那些文件也放到了桌子上。苍龙再次冲上前去，抓起了文件，这次当他把文件放回去时，脸色变得惨白。

"How?…When?" Soryu stammered as he stepped back, utterly shocked. "This can't be legal…"  
“怎样，几时？”昴流惊讶得结结巴巴地后退了一步。 “这不可能是合法的……”

"Ah, but it is legal. Filed in both German and Japanese courts. So you see, you cannot force the Second Child to go anywhere she does not wish to," Gendo said. Soryu's face grew red once more.  
“啊，但这是合法的。在德国和日本法院都提起诉讼。所以你看，你不能强迫老二去她不想去的任何地方，”源堂说。昴流的脸再次红了。

"Bullshit! She is my daughter and she will go where I say and do as I say! I'm not going to let her stay here and become anymore of a slut and a whore than she already is! She is coming with me!" Soryu shouted before he felt a hand on his shoulder, a hand that quickly spun him around to face the young man he had forgotten was behind him.  
“废话！她是我的女儿，我说什么她就去哪里，我说什么就做什么！我不会让她留在这里，变得比现在更荡妇和妓女！她跟我走！ ”苍流大喊一声，然后他感觉到一只手放在了他的肩膀上，这只手迅速将他转过身，面对着他已经忘记在他身后的年轻人。

Once more, he faced the eyes of The Berserker. Shinji brought his hand up before anyone could think and backhanded the German with as much force as he could muster. Soryu landed in a heap at the foot of the elder Ikari's desk, lying in a mixed pool of blood, saliva, urine and broken teeth. Slowly, Soryu sat up and turned to glare at the young Captain when his eyes widened in horror as Shinji stalked toward him with the same fire in his eyes.  
他再次面对狂战士的目光。真嗣在所有人思考之前就举起了手，用尽全力反手击中了德国人。苍龙倒在了碇长老的桌子底下，躺在血、唾液、尿液和断牙的混合池中。苍龙慢慢地坐起来，转头瞪着年轻的队长，他惊恐地睁大了眼睛，而真嗣也带着同样的火焰向他走来。

"Captain Ikari! Contain yourself!" his father barked out as Shinji came to a sudden stop. Something in Shinji's eyes had scared the elder Ikari, and he had no plans to allow his son to commit murder within the office.  
“碇队长！控制住自己！”当真嗣突然停下来时，他的父亲大声叫道。真嗣眼中的某种东西让碇长老感到害怕，他不打算允许儿子在办公室里杀人。

"Don't EVER talk about her like that again!" Snarled the Berserker, causing Soryu to lose what little was left in his bladder.  
“以后不要再这样谈论她了！”狂战士咆哮道，导致苍龙失去了膀胱中所剩无几的东西。

"Stand down, Captain," Misato commanded as she tried to make eye contact with Shinji. _"If he looses it here, they'll be no stopping him short of shooting him! Asuka's back home and there is no way to get her here in time!"_  
“站住，队长，”美里一边命令着，一边试图与真嗣进行眼神交流。 “如果他在这里丢了，他们会毫不犹豫地开枪射杀他！明日香已经回到家了，没有办法及时把她送来这里！”

"Yes ma'am," Shinji said as he finally looked up and made eye contact with her. He took several steps back toward the outer edge of the circle of light that the fallen German had previously been standing in. Soryu finally pulled himself up from the floor and leaned heavily on the Commander's desk.  
“是的，女士，”真嗣说道，他终于抬起头来与她进行了眼神交流。他向后退了几步，朝着倒下的德国人先前站立的光环外缘走去。苍流终于从地板上站起来，重重地靠在指挥官的办公桌上。

"You can't have her, Ikari," Soryu wheezed, as he struggled to speak with an injured mouth. "She's mine, not yours."  
“你不能拥有她，碇，”苍龙喘息着，用受伤的嘴艰难地说话。 “她是我的，不是你的。”

"I don't want her," the elder Ikari answered back, " She and the Captain are engaged to married. Keeping the pilots happy helps to ensure Mankind's survival. But seeing how she's going to marry into the family, I assure you that she will be…well taken care of." A smile more reminiscent of a snarl appeared on the Commander's lips.  
“我不要她，”碇长老回答道，“她和机长已经订婚了。让飞行员开心有助于确保人类的生存。但是看到她将如何嫁入这个家族，我向你保证她会……得到很好的照顾。”指挥官的嘴角浮现出一抹更像咆哮的笑容。

"Major, Captain, you are dismissed. Thank you for your time," Fuyutsuki announced as Misato and Shinji saluted. "There will be no further investigation."  
“少校、队长，您被解散了。谢谢您的宝贵时间。”冬月宣布，美里和真嗣敬礼。 “不会进行进一步调查。”

"Yes sir!" they both answered back as they disappeared into the shadows and left the room. The Sub-Commander stepped back into the shadows as well, leaving the Commander and Soryu alone in the light. A small light on Ikari's desk confirmed the Major and the Captain had left the office. He grinned evilly.  
“是的先生！”两人应了一声，消失在了阴影中，离开了房间。副指挥官也退到了阴影中，只剩下指挥官和苍龙一人在光亮中。碇桌子上的一盏小灯确认少校和上尉已经离开办公室。他邪恶地笑了笑。

"Well, Erik, it seems that you aren't going to get your way, this time," Ikari said as the German leaned forward on his desk.  
“好吧，埃里克，看来这次你不会如愿了，”当德国人靠在桌子上时，伊卡里说道。

"I don't know how you did it, you rotten bastard," Soryu muttered, spitting blood on the desk.  
“我不知道你是怎么做到的，你这个混蛋，”Soryu嘟囔着，把血吐在桌子上。

"I did nothing. The signatures are legitimate and completely legal. It seems you merely didn't wish to be bothered by such a troublesome child. You gladly handed her over to NERV," the Commander replied, happy that for once he had no hand in the legal matters. _"Plausable deniability,"_ he thought.  
“我什么也没做。签名是合法的，完全合法的。看来你只是不想被这么麻烦的孩子打扰。你很乐意将她交给NERV。”指挥官回答道，很高兴这一次他没有交出法律事务。 “貌似合理的否认，”他想。

"Fine, you want the little bitch, you can have her. I disown her, completely. She has no home to go back to when you and your son are finished with her, she'll have no money to start over with when you've used her up, and she'll have no one to turn to when you break her. It's her choice, she'll have to live with it!" Soryu snarled, hoping to score points against the Commander. They were dashed when Ikari flashed a shark's smile.  
“好吧，你想要那个小贱人，你就可以拥有她。我和她断绝关系，彻底的。当你和你儿子结束了她的生活，她就没有家可回了，当你和她在一起的时候，她就没有钱重新开始了。”她已经筋疲力尽了，当你伤害她时，她将没有人可以求助，这是她的选择，她必须忍受这一点！”苍流咆哮着，希望能在指挥官面前得分。当碇露出鲨鱼般的笑容时，他们都惊呆了。

"You better watch what you say about the Second Child. She's to be my daughter-in-law, and you have seen how the Third Child reacts to such _faux pas_," Gendo said as he produced a thick set of folders from within the desk. " As for leaving her in such a state, you are once again mistaken." Slowly, he opened one of the folders.  
“你最好注意一下你对老二的评价。她要成为我的儿媳妇了，你也看到老三对这种失礼的反应了。”源堂一边说，一边从里面拿出了一套厚厚的文件夹。桌子。 “至于让她变成这样，你又错了。”他慢慢地打开其中一个文件夹。

"This is the Will of Kyoko Soryu, the wife you so callously disregarded in her darkest hours. This was written well before her failed contact experiment with Unit 02, so it is absolutely legal," Ikari read off as Soryu's eyes enlarged, wondering how the Commander had gotten such a document. He knew what was coming next, for he had surpressed the Will after Kyoko's 'suicide'.  
“这是苍龙恭子的遗嘱，她是在她最黑暗的时刻被你无情地忽视的妻子。这是在她与 02 号机失败的接触实验之前写下的，所以它绝对合法，”碇在苍龙睁大了眼睛的情况下读道，想知道这是怎么回事。指挥官已经拿到了这样一份文件。他知道接下来会发生什么，因为在杏子“自杀”后，他压制了意志。

"It seems your wife left her entire estate to her daughter, Asuka. You were to act as guardian of the estate until such time as Asuka was a legal adult, at which time all would revert to her. As you well know, that was to be at either the age of eighteen, or until declared an adult by the courts," Gendo grinned, watching the unwelcome guest in his office squirm. "As you have seen, you signed the papers allowing her legal emancipation. Thus, the estate is now legally hers." Erik turned white.  
“看来你的妻子把她的全部财产都留给了她的女儿明日香。你要担任财产的监护人，直到明日香成年为止，届时一切都会归还给她。正如你所知，那是要么是十八岁，要么是在法庭宣布成年之前，”源多笑着看着办公室里这位不速之客的蠕动。 “正如你所看到的，你签署了允许她合法解放的文件。因此，遗产现在合法地属于她。”埃里克的脸色变白了。

"But…but…" he stammered as the Commander pressed forward.  
“但是……但是……”当指挥官向前推进时，他结结巴巴地说。

"I see by this report, you have listed certain properties, bank accounts, investments and such as your own personal property. Unfortunately for you, it seems most of these were brought into the marriage by Kyoko, thus now currently belonging to the Second Child. Thus, your threat to leave the Second Child penniless, homeless, and destitute are as empty as your promises to your dead wife." Ikari's cold heart warmed slightly at the look of utter shock on Soryu's face. _"Now, for the killing stroke!"_ he thought to himself.  
“我从这份报告中看到，你列出了某些财产、银行账户、投资等你自己的个人财产。对你来说不幸的是，其中大部分似乎都是杏子带入婚姻的，因此现在属于第二个孩子因此，你威胁要让老二身无分文，无家可归，一贫如洗，就像你对死去的妻子的承诺一样空洞。”碇冰冷的心看到苍龙一脸震惊的表情，微微温暖起来。 “现在，致命一击！”他心想。

"That…that report must be wrong! Everything belongs to me and my wife!" Soryu stammered before the Commander continued. "You can't have it!"  
“那……那个报道一定是错的！一切都是我和我妻子的！”苍龙结结巴巴地说道，指挥官继续说道。 “你不能拥有它！”

"I don't want it or need it. It belongs to the Second Child. These documents have been forwarded to the German authorities, who are at this time descending down and seizing all of your assets for further examination. I do hope that they don't find any financial…irregularities." Gendo added with a smile, "You realize possible criminal charges could result." He enjoyed Soryu's discomfort.  
“我不想要它，也不需要它。它属于第二个孩子。这些文件已转发给德国当局，德国当局此时正在下降并扣押你的所有资产以进行进一步检查。我确实希望他们没有发现任何财务……违规行为。”源堂微笑着补充道：“你意识到可能会导致刑事指控。”他很享受Soryu的不适。

"This isn't happening…" Soryu muttered, shaking his head.  
“这不会发生……”Soryu摇着头低声说道。

"Now, seeing how you are, in all probability, going to be investigated for possible financial fraud," the Commander announced, " I'm afraid that NERV cannot allow itself to be associated with you any longer. You are now released from NERV, forthwith. All of your clearances and privileges are now hereby revoked. As such, you are to leave NERV property immediately and never return." Soryu's face turned red with anger.  
“现在，看你现在的样子，很可能会因为可能的财务欺诈而接受调查，”指挥官宣布，“恐怕NERV不能再允许自己与你有任何联系了。你现在已经被NERV释放了，立即撤销您的所有许可和特权，因此，您必须立即离开 NERV 财产，并且永远不再返回。”昴流气得脸都红了。

"You can't do that!" he fumed, "I have been with this organization since before it was NERV! We'll see what SEELE has to say about this!"  
“你不能这么做！”他怒道：“在 NERV 出现之前我就加入了这个组织！我们看看 SEELE 对此有何评论！”

"SEELE already knows of the situation," Ikari stated, "and they approve of the solution. However, on a rather more personal note, allow me to tell you this: Do not mess with my family! You brandished a gun in my son's home, with the proof being a wound on the back of his hand! You throw my future daughter-in-law against the wall, endangering her and her baby! I may be considered a total bastard by everyone else, and I gladly use members of my own family to further our goals, but I will NOT allow anyone else to jeopardize their lives! And despite what I may wish, your daughter is about to become family, thus she is under MY protection! Is this understood,Soryu? She is to become an Ikari, no questions asked."  
“SEELE 已经知道了情况，”碇说，“他们也同意这个解决方案。不过，从更个人的角度来说，请允许我告诉你：不要惹恼我的家人！你在我儿子的家里挥舞着枪。”回家，证据就是他手背上的伤口！你把我未来的儿媳妇扔到墙上，危及她和她的孩子，我可能会被其他人认为是一个彻头彻尾的混蛋，我很乐意使用成员！尽管我希望，你的女儿即将成为我的家人，因此她受到我的保护，明白吗，她？就是成为一名碇，毫无疑问。”

"Yes, sir," the German mumbled miserably, as his whole carefully crafted world starts to fall apart around him. Without Kyoko's assets, his own personal fortune will be greatly diminished, and when the authorites discover some of his more…_creative_ …investments, he would surely lose his feedom as well.  
“是的，先生，”德国人痛苦地咕哝道，他周围精心打造的世界开始分崩离析。没有了恭子的资产，他自己的个人财富将大大减少，而当当局发现他的一些更具……创意的……投资时，他也肯定会失去他的地位。

"Section 2 will escort you from the building. You are dismissed," the Commander said as he picked up the folders from his desk and placed them back within it. Soryu turned and started to slowly shuffle back toward the door when Fuyutsuki stepped from the shadows and punched him squarely in the stomache, driving the air from his lungs and sending him to his knees.  
“第二组将护送你离开大楼。你被解雇了，”指挥官一边说，一边从办公桌上拿起文件夹，放回里面。苍龙转身开始慢慢地向门口走去，这时冬月从阴影中走出来，狠狠地击中了他的腹部，将空气从他的肺部排出，把他打倒在地。

"How DARE you treat your own daughter like that?" Fuyutsuki hissed as Soryu's eyes bulged in surprise and pain. "Do you have any idea how badly you have hurt her?"  
“你怎么敢这样对待自己的女儿？”冬月发出嘶嘶声，苍龙的眼睛因惊讶和痛苦而凸出。 “你知道你对她的伤害有多大吗？”

"Fuyutsuki?" the elder Ikari asked as he saw Soryu fall to the floor. He always knew his old sensei had a soft spot for the Children, even the loud-mouthed obnoxious redhead. Plus the fact that Shinji had essentially gotten shot by the man's wife seems to have affected the older gentleman.  
“冬月？”看到苍龙倒在地上，碇长老问道。他一直都知道他的老老师对孩子们情有独钟，甚至是那个大嘴巴、令人讨厌的红发女郎。再加上真嗣基本上是被该男子的妻子枪杀的事实似乎也影响了这位年长的绅士。

"Sorry, Commander. It seems my fist slipped. I apologize," the Sub-Commander said as he withdrew from the fallen German.  
“抱歉，指挥官。看来我的拳头滑倒了。我很抱歉。”副指挥官一边从倒下的德国人身边撤退，一边说道。

"Ah. Well, don't let it happen again," Gendo replied dismissively as he turned his back to the two others and began scanning the other reports from his desk.  
“啊。好吧，别再让这种事发生了。”源堂不屑地回答道，背对着另外两人，开始浏览办公桌上的其他报告。

"Yes sir," Fuyutsuki answered as two NERV agents came into the office and dragged Erik Soryu from the office.  
“是的，先生。”冬月回答道，两名 NERV 特工走进办公室，将 Erik Soryu 拖出了办公室。

"By the way, Fuyutsuki, make sure he and his wife leave Japan as soon as possible. I think there is a military cargo flight bound for Germany leaving shortly. See to it they are on it before it leaves, will you?" Gendo added, laughing heartily inside. It had been a long time coming, but he finally put that stuck-up German in his place.  
“对了，冬月，确保他和他的妻子尽快离开日本。我想很快就会有一架飞往德国的军用货运飞机。请确保他们在飞机起飞前赶上飞机，好吗？”源堂补充道，心里哈哈大笑。已经等了很长时间了，但他终于把那个自以为是的德国人取代了。

"By your command," Fuyutsuki answered before bowing and seeing to the arrangements. He and the Commander shared a vicious smile at the thought.  
“遵命。”冬月回答道，然后鞠躬并负责安排。想到这里，他和指挥官都露出了邪恶的笑容。

_"Well, Shinji,"_ the elder Ikari thought as he tried to focus on the reports before him, _" I may not be much of a father to you, but I hope you and your wife enjoy the wedding present I just acquired for you."_ With that, he reached into his jacket pocket and stared at the well worn photograph in his hand and sighed sadly.  
“好吧，真嗣，”老碇一边想，一边努力把注意力集中在面前的报告上，“我对你来说可能算不上一个父亲，但我希望你和你的妻子喜欢我刚刚给你买的结婚礼物。 ”说着，他把手伸进上衣口袋，看着手里那张破旧的照片，悲伤地叹了口气。

### Chapter 6
_Tuesday, D-day minus four…  
星期二，诺曼底登陆日零四点……_

It had been several days since the disastrous encounter with Asuka's parents, and Rei was still troubled. Why Asuka's parents had such a bad reaction was extremely puzzling to her, and she couldn't understand how they were able to blame her. The fact that they had injured her brother angered her more than she had ever felt before in her life. She still wished that there was something that she could do to them for what they had done, and this reaction worried her. Emotions were still a mystery to her, but not near as much as they had been in the past.  
与明日香父母的灾难性遭遇已经过去好几天了，丽仍然心神不宁。为什么明日香的父母会有如此糟糕的反应，这让她非常不解，她不明白他们怎么能责怪她。他们伤害了她哥哥，这一事实让她感到前所未有的愤怒。她仍然希望自己能对他们做点什么，以弥补他们所做的一切，这种反应让她很担心。情绪对她来说仍然是一个谜，但不像过去那么神秘。

However, there was something else that bothered her, even to the point that she had been unable to sleep much since it had crept into her mind. It had awaken her from a sound sleep the night of the incident, and had yet to let go. She felt as if some invisible hand had reached into her chest and wrapped itself around her heart, making it hard for her to breath or even think. As she had sat up in her bed, she felt tears fall from her eyes and heard her own ragged breathing. This feeling was foreign, and very unwelcome.  
然而，还有一件事让她烦恼不已，甚至让她睡不着觉。事发当晚，它把她从熟睡中惊醒，至今仍未放开。她感觉仿佛有一只无形的手伸入了她的胸口，包裹住了她的心脏，让她呼吸困难，甚至无法思考。当她从床上坐起来时，她感到泪水从眼眶中滑落，并听到自己粗暴的呼吸声。这种感觉很陌生，而且很不受欢迎。

She didn't know what to do as she looked around her quiet, lonely apartment, so she pulled her knees up to her chest and wrapped her arms around her legs and did her best to comfort herself. This had failed miserably, so she quickly jumped up, threw one of her new night gowns on that Misato had insisted she buy , left her apartment and went next door to her brother's place. She knew it was too late at night to wake him up and talk to him, so she made herself comfortable on the couch and went back to sleep, comforted by the fact that Shinji was just in the next room.  
她看着自己安静、孤独的公寓，不知道该怎么办，于是她把膝盖拉到胸前，用双臂抱住双腿，尽力安慰自己。这次失败得很惨，所以她很快跳了起来，穿上了美里坚持要她买的一件新睡衣，离开了她的公寓，去了隔壁她哥哥的住处。她知道夜里已经太晚了，无法叫醒他和他说话，所以她舒服地躺在沙发上，然后又回去睡觉了，真嗣就在隔壁房间，这让她感到安慰。

It was Asuka that found her the next morning and made sure that she was alright, before dragging her up from the sofa and into the kitchen, saying she was going to teach the pale girl how to cook, specifically breakfast. Shinji woke several minutes later to the smell of frying bacon, and was pleasantly surprised to see his fiancée and sister working together to make breakfast, both just chatting away like old friends. He walked over and gave his sister a quick hug and kiss on the cheek before wrapping his arms around Asuka and giving her a deep, toe-curling kiss that left her flustered. Asuka and Rei both shooed him from the kitchen while they finished preparing breakfast.  
第二天早上，明日香找到了她，确认她没事后，把她从沙发上拉起来，进了厨房，说她要教这个脸色苍白的女孩如何做饭，特别是早餐。几分钟后，真嗣在煎培根的香味中醒来，惊喜地看到未婚妻和妹妹一起做早餐，两人像老朋友一样聊天。他走过去，快速地拥抱了妹妹并亲吻了她的脸颊，然后用双臂环住了明日香，给了她一个深深的、卷曲脚趾的吻，这让她心慌意乱。明日香和丽准备好早餐后，将他从厨房赶了出去。

Rei slept better the next night, but the feeling was still within her and she just could not shake it. She spent most of the day Monday to herself, keeping an eye on Asuka from a distance. Shinji and Asuka were both confused about her behavior, as she seemed to be withdrawing back within herself, which greatly concerned her brother. Hikari came over to talk to her, but Rei reassured her that everything was alright, though the Class Representative was clearly not convinced. Shinji was unable to get her to say much of anything on the ride home that night, and she shut herself back within her apartment to try to face her fears down by herself, which failed miserably once more.  
第二天晚上，丽睡得更好了，但这种感觉仍在她内心深处，她无法摆脱。星期一，她大部分时间都是独处，远远地注视着明日香。真嗣和明日香都对她的行为感到困惑，因为她似乎正在退缩，这让她的哥哥非常担心。光走过来和她说话，丽向她保证一切都好，尽管班代表显然不相信。那天晚上回家的路上，真嗣没能让她说太多话，她把自己关在公寓里，试图独自面对恐惧，但结果再次悲惨地失败了。

Now it was Tuesday, and she felt worse than she had since that first night. Nothing she did seemed to alleviate the pain, and the closer it got to Saturday, the worse it became. She felt the strange tears trying to force their way out , and she did everything she could to try to keep them in place, much as Asuka had used to do in the past. It was now lunch, and she was wondering around the schoolyard when she felt an arm wrapped around her waist and was pulled into a hug. She gasped in surprise before she realized who it was that had done so. Rei turned and looked at her brother, and saw deep concern in his blue eyes.  
现在是星期二，她感觉比第一晚以来更糟糕。她所做的一切似乎都无法减轻疼痛，而且越接近周六，疼痛就越严重。她感觉到奇怪的泪水试图强行涌出，她尽一切努力试图让它们保持在原位，就像明日香过去所做的那样。现在已经是午饭时间了，她正在校园里闲逛，突然感觉有一只手臂搂住了她的腰，被拉进了怀里。她惊讶地倒吸一口冷气，然后才意识到是谁干的。雷转身看着哥哥，在他蓝色的眼睛里看到了深深的关切。

"What's wrong, Rei?" Shinji asked with genuine concern as he guided her over to the tree their group liked to sit under when they eat lunch. Much to her surprise, Rei noticed that the tree was currently vacant, though lunch was well under way.  
「怎么了，雷？」真嗣带着真诚的关切问道，他领着她来到了他们吃午饭时喜欢坐在下面的树旁。令她惊讶的是，丽注意到这棵树目前是空的，尽管午餐正在进行中。

"There is nothing wrong, Shinji," Rei answered as she watched her brother shake his head in disbelief.  
“没有什么问题，真嗣，”丽回答道，她看着哥哥难以置信地摇头。

"You know, you're almost as bad a liar as I am," Shinji said with a chuckle as the two of them took a seat under the shade of the branches, blocking most of the harsh sunlight of the day. "I know all about you spending the night Saturday, so tell me what's going on, please? You've become so distant lately, just like you used to be before we got to know each other." Rei looked down at her lap and refused to meet his eyes. Shinji lifted her chin and made her make eye contact with him. He could see the unshed tears within. "What is wrong, sis?"  
“你知道吗，你几乎和我一样是个糟糕的骗子。”真嗣笑着说道，两人在树枝的树荫下坐下，挡住了当天大部分刺眼的阳光。 “我知道你周六过夜的事，所以请告诉我发生了什么事，好吗？你最近变得如此疏远，就像我们认识之前一样。”雷低头看着自己的腿，拒绝看他的眼睛。真嗣抬起下巴，让她与他进行眼神交流。他能看到内心未流的泪水。 “怎么了，姐姐？”

"Do you remember what you told me after you saved me from Armisael?" the albino girl asked as she remembered back to the attack of the Sixteenth Angel. She could still see everything so clearly in her mind, and could still feel the pain as the Angel merged with Unit 00, doing it's best to invade her mind and body. It was only by the intervention of her brother that she survived……  
“你还记得你从阿米赛尔手中救出我之后对我说的话吗？”回想起第十六天使的袭击，白化少女问道。她依然能在脑海中清晰地看到一切，依然能感受到天使与00号部队融合时的痛苦，极力侵入她的身心。正是在哥哥的介入下，她才得以幸存……

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

She had already set the self-destruct system in Unit 00 and had resigned herself to death, in hopes of killing the Angel and saving Shinji. Unknown to Rei at that time, Shinji had already received a package from Kaji, telling him of her nature and her origins. It had shock him greatly to discover that she was a clone, and one cloned from his dead mother. That news paralyzed him in combat as his emotions were in conflict over her nature. It was after he felt a warm touch to his mind that let him know that everything was alright and that allowed him to understand that Rei was his half-sister that his paralysis was broken.  
她已经在00号设定了自毁系统，并甘愿以死求生，希望能杀死天使，拯救真嗣。当时丽并不知道，真嗣已经收到了加持寄来的包裹，告诉他她的性格和出身。当他发现她是一个克隆人，而且是从他死去的母亲身上克隆出来的时候，他感到非常震惊。这个消息使他在战斗中陷入瘫痪，因为他的情绪与她的本性发生了冲突。直到他的心灵感受到一股温暖的触感，让他知道一切都好，让他明白丽是他同父异母的妹妹，他的瘫痪才被打破。

Realizing what Rei had planned to do, Shinji willed Unit 01 to moved faster than it ever had before, actually breaking the sound barrier, and dodging the Angel as it did its best to merge with his EVA as well. Reaching Unit 00, he tore the head from the stricken EVA and pulled the entry plug from it's torso, before lifting Unit 00 with one arm and tossing it and the Angel as far as his strength could. The dying EVA landed on the far side of the closest mountain and detonated with a force the likes of which nobody born after Second Impact had ever seen before. A split second before the blast swept over Unit 01 and Tokyo-3, Shinji projected his A-T field at full strength and deflected the blast toward the sparsely populated countryside. Tokyo-3 and Rei were both safe. It was after this that Shinji gently pulled her from the entry plug and held her so very close, hoping beyond hope that the only member of his family that had yet to reject him was still alive. As he placed her on the gurney of the ambulance, she opened her eyes in wonder and looked straight up into his blue eyes, wordlessly asking him a very important question. His answer startled her.  
意识到丽的计划后，真嗣命令 01 号机以前所未有的速度移动，实际上突破了音障，并避开了天使，因为天使也尽了最大努力与他的 EVA 融合。到达Unit 00时，他从受伤的EVA上撕下头部，并从其躯干上拔下入口插头，然后用一只手臂举起Unit 00，并尽其所能地把它和天使扔得更远。垂死的 EVA 降落在最近的山的另一边，并以第二次冲击后出生的人从未见过的力量引爆。在爆炸席卷 01 号部队和东京 3 号之前的一瞬间，真嗣全力投射了他的 A-T 力场，并将爆炸弹向了人烟稀少的乡村。第三东京和丽都安全了。就在这之后，真嗣轻轻地将她从入口插头中拉出来，紧紧地抱住她，满怀希望地希望他的家人中唯一没有拒绝他的人还活着。当他把她放在救护车的轮床上时，她惊讶地睁开眼睛，直视他的蓝眼睛，无言地问他一个非常重要的问题。他的回答让她吃了一惊。

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Sure, I do. I told you that you were my sister, that I loved you, that I would never leave you, and that I would always be there for you," Shinji answered, still not understanding what was wrong with his sister. He remembered that it wasn't too very long after that that he convinced her to stop taking the medications that Dr. Akagi was ordering her to take. Though they claimed that it was to keep her body from degrading, all they turned out to be were chemicals to keep her under their control, keeping her in Asuka's words, _"a mindless, soulless doll. A useless puppet."_  
“当然，我知道。我告诉过你，你是我的妹妹，我爱你，我永远不会离开你，我会永远在你身边，”真嗣回答道，仍然不明白他的妹妹出了什么问题。 。他记得不久之后，他说服她停止服用赤城医生命令她服用的药物。尽管他们声称这是为了防止她的身体退化，但事实证明，他们只是用化学物质来控制她，用明日香的话说，让她“成为一个没有头脑、没有灵魂的娃娃。一个无用的傀儡。”

"I am worried," Rei said as a small tear escaped and rolled down her cheek, "I know that you love Asuka, and she loves you, and you both love the baby growing within her. But I was wondering…" she trailed off as more tears broke free and slid down her face. Shinji reached over and wiped them from her face as best he could. He had never seen his sister that emotional before, and this worried him.  
“我很担心，”丽说，一滴小泪水从她的脸颊上滑落，“我知道你爱明日香，她也爱你，你们也都爱她体内正在成长的婴儿。但我想知道……”她拖着脚步说道。更多的泪水夺眶而出，从她的脸上滑落。真嗣伸出手，尽力把它们从她脸上擦掉。他以前从未见过妹妹如此情绪化，这让他很担心。

"I…I was wondering," she continued as a lump formed in her throat and the pain in her chest threatened to overwhelm her, " Will you still love me? Will you still be there for me? Will there still be room in your life for your sister? Will I end up all alone again?" her lower lip trembled uncontrollably as the tears flowed freely. Shinji just sat there in shock, never in his wildest dreams ever thinking that Rei would ever feel this way. She turned her head and faced away from him, staring down at the ground.  
“我……我在想，”她继续说道，喉咙里有一个肿块，胸口的疼痛几乎要压倒她，“你还会爱我吗？你还会在我身边吗？你的心里还有空间吗？”我会再次孤独一人吗？她的下唇不受控制地颤抖着，泪水肆意流淌。真嗣震惊地坐在那里，他做梦也没有想到丽会有这种感觉。她转过头，背对着他，低头看着地面。

"Rei," he said in a very gentle, soothing way as he tried to assuage her fears. She spoke up once more before he could continue.  
“丽，”他用一种非常温柔、舒缓的方式说道，试图减轻她的恐惧。还没等他继续说下去，她又开口了。

"I know…I understand that thinking this way makes me a horrible, selfish person. But it frightens me so! I…I do not want to lose my family!" she sobbed as she leaned against her brother seeking comfort, comfort he was more than willing to give.  
“我知道……我明白这样的想法让我成为一个可怕、自私的人。但这让我很害怕！我……我不想失去我的家人！”她靠在哥哥身上哭泣，寻求安慰，而他非常愿意给予安慰。

"It's okay, Rei, it's alright," Shinji said as he held onto his sister and stoked her hair, trying his best to calm the frightened girl. "You are not going to loose your family! Trust me, if anything, it's going to get larger than ever!" She looked at him, very confused.  
“没关系，丽，没关系。”真嗣一边说，一边抓住妹妹，抚摸着她的头发，尽力安抚这个受惊的女孩。 “你不会失去你的家人！相信我，如果有的话，它会变得比以往任何时候都更大！”她看着他，很困惑。

"I do not understand," she replied, as her sobs began to lessen. Her brother held her tight, sharing his strength with her.  
“我不明白，”她回答道，抽泣声开始减弱。哥哥紧紧地抱住她，与她分享自己的力量。

"Well, let's see: Asuka already accepts you as a sister, doesn't she?" he asked gently, prodding her to get her thought processes working.  
“好吧，让我看看：明日香已经认你为妹妹了，不是吗？”他温柔地问道，鼓励她让自己的思维过程运转起来。

"Yes," the blue-haired girl replied, sniffling somewhat, "We have gotten quite close. She is even teaching me how to cook."  
“是的，”蓝发女孩有些吸鼻子，“我们已经很亲近了，她还教我做饭。”

"See? Once Asuka and I get married Saturday, you'll have a little niece that's going to need her Aunt Rei, right?" Shinji asked once more, hoping that he was getting his sister to understand.  
“明白了吗？一旦明日香和我周六结婚，你就会有一个小侄女，她会需要她的丽阿姨，对吧？”真嗣再次问道，希望能让妹妹明白。

"I hope so," Rei answered back, her tears slowing down. Seeing this raised Shinji's spirits somewhat.  
“我希望如此，”丽回答道，她的泪水慢慢流了下来。看到这一幕，真嗣的精神有些振奋。

"I know so. With our wedding, Heidi will be related to you through marriage, so that just adds more to our family, right?" he added, knowing full well that Heidi had already 'adopted' Rei into her family. "Plus, Misato has been a mother to all three of us, hasn't she? More so than any mother any of us have ever known?"  
“我知道，我们结婚之后，海蒂就和你有了联姻的关系，这样我们的家庭就会更加充实吧？”他补充道，他很清楚海蒂已经“收养”了丽进入她的家庭。 “另外，美里一直是我们三个人的母亲，不是吗？比我们认识的任何母亲都更重要？”

"True," Rei nodded her head in agreement. "The Major…er…Misato has looked after us very well."  
“确实如此。”雷伊点头表示同意。 “少校……呃……美里把我们照顾得很好。”

"I will always love you, Rei. You're my sister. There is more than enough room in my life for you. If anything, I'll probably need you more than ever. Believe it or not, all of this kind of scares me still. I love Asuka and the baby, but this is still a huge step we're taking," Shinji said, trembling slightly. " I'll always be there for you, you can trust me on that!"  
“我会永远爱你，丽。你是我的妹妹。我的生活中有足够的空间容纳你。如果有的话，我可能会比以往任何时候都更需要你。不管你信不信，所有这些我仍然感到害怕。我爱明日香和孩子，但这仍然是我们迈出的一大步，”真嗣说，微微颤抖。 “我会一直在你身边，你可以相信我！”

"Thank you, brother," Rei replied as she leaned over and hugged her brother, now doing her part to comfort him. "I was afraid that Asuka was taking you from me, and I felt bad about feeling that way."  
“谢谢你，兄弟。”丽回答道，她俯身拥抱了她的兄弟，现在正在尽力安慰他。 “我害怕明日香会把你从我身边夺走，这种感觉让我感觉很糟糕。”

"It's okay, Rei. That's a normal human reaction," he said as the two of them sat back against the tree and relaxed, watching the rest of the students go about their normal day. His thoughts turned to the woman he loved. "I wonder what Asuka's up to?"  
“没关系，丽。这是人类的正常反应，”他说，两人靠在树上放松下来，看着其他学生过着正常的一天。他的思绪转向了他所爱的女人。 “我想知道明日香在做什么？”

"Shinji? Please do not tell Asuka about this. I do not wish for her to hate me," Rei asked as she pulled what looked like a small video game from a fold in her dress and started working it's controls. Shinji looked on curiously.  
“真嗣？请不要告诉明日香这件事。我不希望她恨我。”丽一边问道，一边从裙子的褶皱里拿出一个看起来像小电子游戏的东西，开始操作它的控制器。慎二好奇地看着。

"She wouldn't hate you, Rei, but I promise not to tell her," he answered as he looked on, trying to figure out what his sister was doing. "What are you doing?"  
“她不会恨你，丽，但我保证不会告诉她，”他边回答边看着，试图弄清楚他的妹妹在做什么。 “你在干什么？”

"Trying to find out where my future sister is," she replied as she worked the controls. Now Shinji was really confused. Rei's eyes widened ever so slightly as she quickly stood. "Thank you, Shinji. Please, enjoy the rest of the lunch period."  
“试图找出我未来的妹妹在哪里，”她一边操作控制器一边回答道。现在真嗣真的很困惑。丽的眼睛微微睁大，迅速站了起来。 「谢谢你，真嗣。请享受剩下的午餐时间。」

"Uh, sure thing, Rei," he answered back as he watched his sister take off down the hill at a quick walk, still puzzled at how playing a video game was going to help Rei find Asuka. His sister could still act so strange at times.  
“呃，当然可以，丽，”当他看着妹妹快步走下山时，他回答道，仍然对玩电子游戏如何帮助丽找到明日香感到困惑。他的妹妹有时还是会表现得很奇怪。

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The wedding was now less than a week away, and Asuka still had a hundred things on her mind. Even though Heidi and Misato were doing their best to help her plan everything, she still felt as if the main responsibility fell on her. After the episode with her father and step-mother, things felt bleak, very bleak.  
距离婚礼还有不到一周的时间，明日香心里还有一百件事要考虑。尽管海蒂和美里竭尽全力帮她计划一切，但她仍然觉得主要责任落在她身上。在与父亲和继母发生那件事之后，一切都变得黯淡无光，非常黯淡。

After all, who flies to Japan just to call their daughter a whore and disown her? Now, she was hearing all sorts of whispers and grumbling around the school about the marriage, getting dirty looks from a lot of the girls who wanted Shinji, as well as many of the guys who wanted nothing more than to spread her legs and knew they had no chance now that she was getting married. Plus, the fact that Rei had been acting very strange, even for her, the past couple of days didn't help the situation out whatsoever. She didn't need this kind of stress.  
毕竟，谁飞到日本只是为了骂自己的女儿是妓女并与她断绝关系呢？现在，她在学校里听到了关于这桩婚姻的各种窃窃私语和抱怨声，受到了许多想要真嗣的女孩以及许多只想张开双腿并知道他们是自己的男人的鄙视。现在她要结婚了，没有机会了。再加上丽的表现很奇怪，即使对她来说，这几天也无济于事。她不需要这样的压力。

The only bright spots in her day were Shinji and the baby. She loved her friends too, but Shinji's instructions to them left her feeling smothered most of the time. Asuka knew it was done out of love, but sometimes it really drove her nuts. The only private time she got in school was when she wanted to go to the restroom, and even then she'd have to dodge Hikari or Rei.  
她这一天唯一的亮点就是真嗣和孩子。她也爱她的朋友们，但真嗣对他们的指示让她大部分时间都感到窒息。明日香知道这是出于爱，但有时这真的让她抓狂。她在学校里唯一的私人时间是她想去洗手间的时候，即便如此，她也必须躲开光或丽。

"Well," she thought to herself as she smiled to herself, "I got away this time!" She washed her hands and managed to get two steps out the door before her whole world went black.  
“好吧，”她暗自微笑道，“这次我逃走了！”她洗了手，走出门两步，然后整个世界都变黑了。

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Wakey, wakey, bitch!" a voice called as Asuka felt cold water hit her face.  
“醒醒，醒醒，贱人！”当明日香感觉到冷水打在她的脸上时，一个声音叫道。

"Huh? What? What the hell?" she grumbled as she struggled to regain consciousness. She tried to move around only to discover something was holding onto her wrists rather tightly. Opening her eyes, she saw that they were being held by two girls who looked vaguely familiar.  
“啊？什么？到底什么？”她一边抱怨着，一边挣扎着恢复意识。她想要动动身体，却发现有什么东西紧紧地抓着她的手腕。睁开眼睛，她发现自己被两个看起来有些眼熟的女孩抱着。

"Aww, is the poor little slut groggy?" the same voice called back while Asuka shook her head to get rid of the cobwebs. Looking about, she discovered she back in the girls restroom. The back of her head was aching from where someone had obviously struck her, which was unfortunately the same spot where she had slammed her head into the wall the previous Sunday, when her father had thrown her against the wall. "Wake up, bitch! I want to enjoy this!"  
“哇哦，这个可怜的小荡妇是不是昏昏沉沉的？”当明日香摇摇头摆脱蜘蛛网时，同样的声音也响起了。回头一看，发现自己又回到了女厕所。她后脑勺的疼痛明显是有人打了她，不幸的是，这正是上周日她父亲把她扔到墙上时，她的头撞到墙上的地方。 “醒醒吧，贱人！我要享受这个！”

Asuka's eyes opened wider as she faced the person who was addressing her so rudely. It turned out to be Kiki Natsume, the same girl who had confronted Asuka about Shinji several weeks ago. Asuka's face contorted in rage as a growl grew in her throat.  
面对如此粗鲁地对她说话的人，明日香睁大了眼睛。原来是琪琪夏目，几周前就真嗣问题与明日香对质的那个女孩。明日香的脸因愤怒而扭曲，喉咙里发出咆哮。

"Ah, I see the lights have finally come on," Kiki sneered as she threw the empty cup that she had been holding to the tile floor. "About time, slut!"  
“啊，我看到灯终于亮了。”琪琪冷笑着将手里的空杯子扔到了瓷砖地板上。 “是时候了，贱人！”

"What the hell is going on? Just who do you think your calling a 'slut' and a 'bitch'….OUCH!!" Asuka screamed as Kiki took a step forward and slapped Asuka as hard as she could. Asuka struggled to get free, but was still being held by the two other girls, and was still too groggy to put up much of a fight.  
“到底是怎么回事？你以为你骂谁是‘荡妇’和‘母狗’……哎呀！！”琪琪向前迈出一步，用尽全力打了明日香一巴掌，明日香尖叫起来。明日香挣扎着想挣脱，但仍然被另外两个女孩抓住，而且仍然昏昏沉沉，无力反抗。

"Now, now! Mind your manners! You are in no position to do much of anything right now, Soryu," Kiki said as she got up very close to Asuka's face, her teeth glinting in the cold light of the fluorescent bulbs of the washroom. "I know your secret!" she whispered.  
“现在，现在！注意你的举止！你现在不能做任何事，Soryu，”琪琪说，她站起来非常靠近明日香的脸，她的牙齿在荧光灯泡的冷光下闪闪发光。卫生间。 “我知道你的秘密！”她低声说道。

"What?" Asuka gasped, going deathly pale as her attacker smirked at her reaction. Kiki knew she was right.  
“什么？”明日香喘着气，脸色惨白，攻击者对她的反应傻笑。琪琪知道她是对的。

"I said I know your secret! You obviously spread your legs like the tramp you are and got knocked up. That's the only reason a great guy like Shinji would ask you to marry him! Hell, knowing you, you probably beat him into it!" The other girls just giggled at everything Kiki had just said, as if it were the funniest thing they had ever heard. Asuka struggled even harder.  
“我说过我知道你的秘密！你显然像个流浪汉一样张开双腿，然后被撞倒了。这就是像真嗣这样的好男人向你求婚的唯一原因！见鬼，了解你，你可能会打败他！”其他女孩只是对琪琪刚才说的一切咯咯地笑，就好像这是她们听过的最有趣的事情一样。明日香更加挣扎。

"Fuck you, Natsume! This baby is Shinji's!" Asuka growled back, causing the sneer on Kiki's face to drop into a very hard scowl. "Why do you even give a damn if Shinji and I are together? It's not like you ever showed any interest in him before!" Asuka snarled as she continued to struggle against the two that held her in place. _"You better not even think about laying a finger on him, bitch!"_ she thought.  
“操你，夏目！这孩子是真嗣的！”明日香咆哮着回应，让琪琪脸上的冷笑变成了严厉的皱眉。 “我和真嗣在一起了，你为什么还要在意呢？你以前好像从来没有对他表现出过任何兴趣！”明日香一边咆哮着，一边继续与将她固定在原地的两人作斗争。 “你最好别想动他一根手指头，贱人！”她想。

"Well, me and a few of the other girls always thought that he was kind of cute, but after seeing how loving and protective he's suddenly become of you, I just knew I had to make him mine! I think he'll choose me over some redheaded bitch any day when the only reason he's with you is about to disappear!" Asuka's tormenter gloated as a horrific smile crept upon her lips. Asuka gasped.  
“好吧，我和其他几个女孩一直认为他有点可爱，但在看到他突然对你变得多么爱和保护之后，我就知道我必须让他成为我的！我想他会选择我任何一天，当他和你在一起的唯一理由即将消失时，都会为了某个红发婊子！”明日香的折磨者幸灾乐祸，嘴角浮现出可怕的微笑。明日香喘着气。

_"Ach mein Gott!"_ Asuka thought to herself, as she watched Kiki ball up her fist and cock back her arm, _"She's going to kill my baby!"_ Asuka's years of hand-to-hand combat training clicked on instantly as she watched the insane girl lunge at her. Locking her arms in place and putting all her weight on her left foot, Asuka snapped her right foot straight up just as Kiki got into range.  
“啊我哥特！”当明日香看着琪琪握紧拳头并向后抬起手臂时，她心里想：“她会杀了我的孩子！”当明日香看到这个疯狂的女孩向她扑来时，她多年的肉搏战训练立即发挥了作用。正当琪琪进入攻击范围时，明日香将双臂固定到位，将所有重量集中在左脚上，猛地抬起右脚。

"Owwww!!" Kiki screamed as Asuka's foot connected, sending teeth and blood flying across the restroom, splattering the gleaming white in streaks of crimson. The injured girl collapsed in a heap, crying loudly. Asuka hoped to use the confusion of the situation to break free, praying that Kiki's friends would rush to her aide. Unfortunately, this was not the case.  
“噢噢！！”当明日香的脚接触到时，琪琪尖叫起来，牙齿和鲜血飞过卫生间，在闪闪发光的白色上溅满了红色的条纹。受伤的女孩倒在地上，放声大哭。明日香希望利用混乱的局势挣脱束缚，祈祷琪琪的朋友们能够赶到她的助手身边。不幸的是，事实并非如此。

"You bitch!!" Kiki screamed as she dragged herself up off of the floor, tears and blood pouring down her face. Asuka was satisfied to see she had split Kiki's chin and lower lip. When she opened her mouth, Asuka could see that the girl was missing several teeth, along with several others severely broken.  
“你这个混蛋！！”琪琪尖叫着从地板上爬起来，泪水和鲜血从她的脸上流下来。明日香很满意地看到她劈开了琪琪的下巴和下唇。当她张开嘴时，明日香可以看到女孩少了几颗牙齿，还有几颗牙齿严重折断。

"Humph! The outside matches the inside, now!" Asuka sneered as Kiki's face contorted with rage.  
“哼！表里如一！”明日香冷笑一声，琪琪的脸因愤怒而扭曲。

"You know something, you sorry tramp?" Kiki mumbled as she reached into the front of her dress, "I really wanted to enjoy this! I wanted to make it slow and so very painful. I wanted to know that I had beaten that bastard right out of you, so I could be the first one there and console Shinji properly!"  
“你知道些什么吗，你这个流浪汉？”琪琪一边把手伸进裙子的前面，一边嘟哝着，“我真的很想享受这个！我想让它变得缓慢，而且非常痛苦。我想知道我已经把那个混蛋从你身上打败了，这样我就可以了第一个到了，好好安慰真嗣吧！”

"Sorry to ruin your plans, you rotten pile of shit!" Asuka snarled as Kiki pulled her hand back out of her dress and revealed a small pocket knife.  
“抱歉，破坏了你的计划，你这个废物！”当琪琪把手从裙子里抽出来并露出一把小刀时，明日香咆哮道。

"You fucking ruined my face!" Kiki screamed, red from head to toe, "No one's going to want me now! You ruined my life, you fucking whore!! I ought to kill you!"  
“你他妈毁了我的脸！”琪琪尖叫起来，从头到脚都红了，“现在没人要我了！你毁了我的生活，你这个该死的妓女！！我应该杀了你！”

_"She tries to kill my baby, and now wants to kill me because of a few broken teeth? Damn, this girl is nuts!"_ Asuka thought to herself as her eyes grew wide at the sight of the blade being flashed before her.  
“她想杀我的孩子，现在因为断了几颗牙就想杀我？妈的，这丫头疯了！”明日香心中想着，看到眼前闪过的刀刃，她睁大了眼睛。

"I guess I'll just have to make this look like self-defense," Kiki growled as she twirled the knife and prepared to stab Asuka. The young German braced for it, getting ready to kick at her attacker again, but knowing that she was going to get cut, one way or another.  
“我想我只能让这看起来像是自卫，”琪琪咆哮道，她转动着刀准备刺伤明日香。这位年轻的德国人做好了准备，准备再次向袭击者踢去，但她知道自己无论如何都会被砍伤。

"Don't do this, Natsume! You can walk away right now before you do something stupid!" Asuka said, hoping that the girl would see reason. A sinister smile crossed Kiki's lips.  
「夏目，别这样！在你做出蠢事之前，你现在就可以走开！」明日香说道，希望少女能够明白道理。琪琪的嘴角浮现出一丝阴险的微笑。

"Goodbye, bitch!" Kiki barked as she pulled her arm back, getting ready to put all her strength into the first thrust.  
“再见，贱人！”琪琪一边叫着，一边收回手臂，准备用尽全身的力气进行第一次刺击。

**KA-CLICK! 咔嗒！**

"Put the knife down, Natsume," Rei Ayanami commanded as she held her service pistol to the side of Kiki's head. The bleeding girl stood stock still, but the smell of urine permeated the air.  
“夏目，把刀放下。”绫波丽将手枪抵在琪琪的头侧，命令道。流着血的女孩一动不动地站着，空气中却弥漫着尿骚味。

"What…what are you doing?!" Kiki screamed. "You have a gun in school?! What kind of nut job are you, Ayanami?"  
“你……你在做什么？！”琪琪尖叫起来。 「你在学校里有枪？！绫波，你到底是个什么疯子？」

"I am a member of the military. I am required to carry one at all times. The question is: what are you doing with a knife in school?" Rei calmly asked back.  
“我是一名军人。我被要求随时携带一把刀。问题是：你在学校带刀做什么？”雷伊平静地反问道。

"It's for self-defense! Can't you see what that redheaded psycho did to me? My friends just managed to pull her off of me! She attacked me because I told her that Shinji was leaving her for me!" Kiki lied desperately looking to her two companions. Both merely stood there wide-eyed before nodding their heads violently in agreement.  
“这是为了自卫！你没看到那个红发疯子对我做了什么吗？我的朋友们刚刚把她从我身上拉了下来！她攻击我，因为我告诉她真嗣要为了我而离开她！”琪琪绝望地躺着，看着她的两个同伴。两人只是睁大眼睛站在那里，然后猛烈点头表示同意。

"Really? That was not what your friend outside the door said when I came here looking for Asuka. She was quite…_happy_…to tell me everything." the blue-haired pilot said calmly, but in a voice that sent chills down Kiki's spine.  
“真的吗？当我来这里寻找明日香时，你门外的朋友可不是这么说的。她很……很高兴……告诉了我一切。”蓝发飞行员平静地说，但声音却让琪琪脊背发凉。

"That's bull, Ayanami!," Kiki spat, "Hinata would never tell you anything! She knows I'd kick her ass!"  
“那是胡言乱语，绫波！”琪琪骂道，“日向永远不会告诉你任何事！她知道我会踢她屁股！”

"I can be quite persuasive when I have to be," Rei remarked, pressing the gun tighter to Kiki's head. "Drop the knife now, before there is an unfortunate…_accident_." The knife quickly fell to the floor, as Rei's blood red eyes turned and locked unto Kiki's two friends.  
“必要时我可以很有说服力，”雷说道，同时把枪更紧地抵在琪琪的头上。 “现在就放下刀子，以免发生不幸的……事故。”刀很快掉到了地上，雷的血红色眼睛一转，锁定了琪琪的两个朋友。

"It would be advisable for the two of you to release Asuka and report directly to the principle's office for your punishment. Hikari has already informed them that you are on your way," Rei said flatly as the two accomplices released Asuka and ran from the room, leaving only two pilots and one very frightened Kiki Natsume.  
“你们两个最好还是释放明日香，直接去校长办公室报到，接受处罚。光已经通知他们，你们已经在路上了。”雷平淡地说，两名同伙放开了明日香，跑出了办公室。房间里只剩下两名飞行员和一名非常害怕的琪琪夏目。

"Look, Rei, I don't know what Hinata told you, but…URK!" Kiki started to say before a pistol, a twin to the first, was crammed into her mouth. Tears started to flow as Kiki looked into the murderous eyes of the Red-Headed Demon.  
“听着，丽，我不知道日向告诉你什么，但是……URK！”琪琪刚要开口说话，一把手枪就被塞进了她的嘴里，这把手枪是第一支手枪的双胞胎。琪琪看着红发恶魔那双充满杀气的眼睛，眼泪夺眶而出。

"You…fucking…little…skank," Asuka seethed, doing everything she could to control herself and not squeeze the trigger. "You threatened to kill my baby just so you could get a boy who you really don't like, but want because someone else already has him? What kind of Grade A psycho are you?" Kiki started to sob around the barrel of the gun as the smell of feces began to linger. "I ought to put a bullet through your fucking brain right now!"  
“你……他妈的……小……贱人，”明日香怒气冲冲，竭尽全力控制自己不要扣动扳机。 “你威胁要杀死我的孩子，只是为了得到一个你真的不喜欢的男孩，但因为别人已经拥有了他而想要得到他？你是什么样的A级神经病？”当粪便的气味开始萦绕时，琪琪开始在枪管周围抽泣。 “我现在就应该用子弹射穿你该死的大脑！”

"While that may be most enjoyable, Asuka, that would not be a wise move. We should turn her over to the authorities and let them deal with her," Rei said calmly. Asuka's eyes bugged out at the suggestion.  
“虽然这可能是最令人愉快的，明日香，但这不是明智之举。我们应该把她交给当局，让他们处理她，”丽平静地说。听到这个建议，明日香的眼睛都瞪大了。

"Are you crazy, Rei? You know what will happen! She and her little friends will say the two mean old EVA pilots jumped them and beat them up! It will be their word against ours! Besides, she tried to kill my baby and take my Shinji!!" Asuka screamed. She so wanted to twitch her finger and smear Kiki's brains all over the wall. Said girl was still sobbing and violently trembling.  
“你疯了吗，丽？你知道会发生什么！她和她的小朋友会说那两个卑鄙的老EVA飞行员跳了他们并殴打了他们！这将是他们对我们的反对！此外，她试图杀死我的孩子并且带走我的真嗣！！”明日香尖叫起来。她真想抽动手指，把琪琪的​​脑浆涂满墙上。那个女孩还在抽泣，浑身剧烈颤抖。

"Asuka, you cannot do this, just think of what would happen to the baby and Shinji if you were sent to prison," Rei reasoned with the upset redhead, then produced a memory stick from her dress, "We have all the proof we need, right here." Kiki and Asuka's eyes both shot up.  
“明日香，你不能这样做，想想如果你被送进监狱，孩子和真嗣会发生什么，”丽对心烦意乱的红发推理，然后从她的衣服里拿出一根记忆棒，“我们有所有的证据需要，就在这里。”琪琪和明日香的眼睛都瞪了起来。

"What is that?" the young German asked. The blue haired girl smiled ever so slightly.  
“那是什么？”年轻的德国人问道。蓝发少女的笑容十分浅淡。

"I had Kensuke help me wire all the girl's restrooms with a video feed, after seeing what kind of treatment you received from many of our fellow students when all this started," Rei explained, still eyeing the gun in Natsume's mouth. "Do not worry, only Hikari and I have access to the feed, I made sure of that! Now please, take the weapon out of her mouth so we can have her escorted to the office. I believe that there are several Section 2 agents standing just outside the door right about now." Reluctantly, Asuka did as Rei asked, as the albino grabbed Kiki roughly by the upper arm and shoved her out the door, right into the waiting arms of two rather large men. They proceeded to drag the young girl toward the principle's office.  
“在看到你在这一切开始时从我们许多同学那里受到的待遇后，我让健介帮我用视频连接了所有女孩的卫生间，”丽解释道，仍然盯着夏目嘴里的枪。 “别担心，只有 Hikari 和我能接触到这些信息，我已经确定了！现在请把武器从她嘴里拿出来，这样我们就可以护送她去办公室了。我相信有几名第 2 部特工现在就站在门外。”明日香不情愿地按照丽的要求做了，白化病患者粗暴地抓住了琪琪的上臂，把她推出了门外，直接投入了两个身材魁梧的男人的怀抱中。他们继续把年轻女孩拖向校长办公室。

"Rei? How? Why?," Asuka asked, still dazed by the assault and the rapid turn of events, as she dropped her pistol to her side and rubbed her belly with her other hand. _"That was too close,"_ she thought. "If Shinji put you up to this…"  
“丽？怎么？为什么？”明日香问道，她仍然对袭击和事态的迅速转变感到茫然，她把手枪放在身边，用另一只手揉着肚子。 “那太近了，”她想。 “如果真嗣让你这么做的话……”

"It was not my brother's idea, though he would probably appreciate it if he knew," Rei answered back as she re-holstered her weapon, then stood there with her hands behind her back, looking somewhat lost at what should happen next. "Hikari and I thought it would be most prudent seeing to your propensity to go off on your own, despite what is in your best interest."  
“这不是我哥哥的主意，尽管如果他知道的话，他可能会很感激。”雷回答道，她重新收起武器，然后双手背在身后站在那里，看起来对接下来会发生的事情有些茫然。 “Hikari 和我认为，最谨慎的做法是观察你自行离开的倾向，尽管这最符合你的利益。”

"Rei, I.…I don't know what to say," Asuka murmured, her eyes wide and glistening.  
“丽，我……我不知道该说什么，”明日香低声说道，她的眼睛睁得大大的，闪闪发光。

"There is nothing to say, Asuka, I was merely.." was all Rei was say before she heard Asuka's gun hit the floor and the redhead jumped forward and wrapped her arms around her, slightly crushing her in an unexpected bear hug.  
“没什么可说的，明日香，我只是……”丽只说了这么一句话，就听到明日香的枪落在地板上，红发女郎跳上前，用双臂搂住她，意外地用熊抱将她轻轻压碎。

"Thank you, Rei! Thank you," Asuka whispered as the tears began to slide down her cheeks. "You saved my baby!" Caught off guard, Rei hesitantly wrapped her own arms around the sobbing girl. Her heart warmed up as she began to really feel close to only the second person in her strange life.  
“谢谢你，丽！谢谢你，”明日香低声说道，泪水开始从她的脸颊上滑落。 “你救了我的孩子！”丽措手不及，犹豫着用双臂搂住哭泣的女孩。当她开始真正感觉到自己与她陌生的生活中的第二个人很亲近时，她的心变得温暖起来。

"It is okay, 'sis', " Rei answered as her own tears began to fall, releasing the pent up turmoil that had confused her the past several days. Asuka pulled back some and gave Rei a surprised smile before the two girls began hugging each other once more, as tears of sadness, stress, and happiness mixed on their cheeks and wetting each others shoulders.  
“没关系，‘姐姐’，”丽回答道，她的眼泪开始掉下来，释放了她几天来压抑的不安。明日香收回了一些，给了丽一个惊讶的微笑，然后两个女孩开始再次拥抱在一起，悲伤、压力和幸福的泪水混合在她们的脸颊上，打湿了彼此的肩膀。

" 'Sis', huh?" Asuka asked as she pulled away and wiped the moisture from her eyes, as Rei did the same, "It's about time! I was getting worried about you, you know. The last couple of days, you've been more withdrawn than usual. What was wrong?"  
“‘姐姐’，嗯？”明日香一边问道，一边退开身子，擦去眼角的泪水，丽也这么做了，“是时候了！你知道吗，我开始担心你了。最近几天，你比平时更加​​孤僻。什么问题？”

"I was….worried," Rei replied as she stooped down, picked up Asuka's pistol and handed it back to her, "I was afraid that you were taking my brother away from me. I didn't want to lose my family."  
“我……担心，”丽弯下腰，捡起明日香的手枪，递还给她，“我担心你会把我哥哥从我身边夺走。我不想失去我的家人。 ”

"That's silly, Rei," Asuka said as she put her firearm away. "I look forward to having you as my sister-in-law! I would never take Shinji from you!"  
“这太愚蠢了，丽，”明日香一边说一边收起她的枪。 “我期待着你成为我的嫂子！我永远不会把真嗣从你身边夺走！”

"I know that now. Shinji and I had a talk before I came looking for you," Rei replied as she and Asuka left the restroom and started to walk toward the principle's office.  
“我现在知道了。来找你之前，我和真嗣谈过话。”丽一边回答，一边和明日香离开卫生间，朝校长办公室走去。

"By the way, how do you know that Kensuke doesn't have a secret feed from the restroom just for himself? I wouldn't put it past the little pervert, you know?" Asuka asked, looking at her fellow pilot from the corner of her eye. She saw Rei smile slightly, then frown just a bit.  
“对了，你怎么知道健介没有从厕所里偷偷给自己吃东西？我不会放过这个小变态的，你知道吗？”明日香用余光看着她的飞行员同伴问道。她看到雷微微一笑，然后皱起了眉头。

"Several reasons, actually. First off, the fear that you would kill him if we ever discovered such an intrusion. Next, the fear that all the other girls would kill him if they knew. Then the fact that the video feed is encrypted and only Hikari and I have the key," Rei said as she counted the reasons off on her fingers, then frowned some more, " And I agreed to go on a date with him if he promised to not try to gain access to it." Asuka stopped, her jaw opened in shock.  
“实际上有几个原因。首先，担心如果我们发现这样的入侵，你会杀了他。其次，担心所有其他女孩如果知道的话会杀了他。然后，视频源是加密的，只有光和我有钥匙，”丽一边说着，一边用手指数着原因，然后皱起眉头，“如果他答应不尝试接触钥匙，我就同意和他约会。”明日香停了下来，惊讶地张开了下巴。

"WHAT?! You agreed to go on a date with Kensuke?" Asuka screamed, causing Rei to cringe a bit, "Are you nuts? There's no telling what that little sneak will try on you! My baby and I aren't worth it!" Rei couldn't help but giggle a bit at the last comment. Asuka joined her.  
“什么？！你同意和健介约会？”明日香尖叫起来，让丽有点畏缩，“你疯了吗？不知道那个小鬼会对你做什么！我和我的宝贝不值得！”看到最后一句话，雷伊忍不住咯咯笑起来。明日香加入了她。

"It is alright, Asuka! I insisted that I will be the one picking where we will go and what we will do. He agreed to it most readily. I will be wearing my anti-pervert perfume and carrying a tazer with when we go out. It will be just one date, trust me!" Rei said, bringing more laughs from the traumatized redhead as they continued their journey.  
“没关系，明日香！我坚持要由我来决定我们去哪里和做什么。他很爽快地同意了。我们走的时候我会喷上防色狼香水，带着泰瑟枪。”这只是一次约会，相信我！”雷伊说道，在他们继续旅程的过程中，给受过创伤的红发女郎带来了更多的笑声。

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Could somebody get the door, please?" Shinji called out from the kitchen when he heard the door chimes, "I'm a bit busy!"  
“请问有人可以开门吗？”听到敲门声，真嗣从厨房里喊道：“我有点忙！”

"I'll get it!" Asuka called back as she passed the kitchen and peeked in on the man in her life, who was busy making fresh egg rolls and showing his sister how it should be done. "Seeing how you're too dang lazy to do it yourself!" she added with a smirk.  
“我会得到它的！”当明日香经过厨房时，她回了过来，瞥了一眼她生命中的那个男人，他正忙着做新鲜的蛋卷，并向他的妹妹展示应该如何做。 “看你怎么懒得自己动手！”她笑着补充道。

"Hey, I'm making dinner here!" he fussed back, giving her a quick wink as Rei looked on , confused at their banter.  
“喂，我在这儿做饭呢！”他大惊小怪地回应道，快速地眨了眨眼，雷在一旁看着，对他们的玩笑感到困惑。

"What? You can't do both at the same time? What kind of lazy bum am I marrying?" Asuka shot back, returning his wink. Shinji stuck his tongue out and threw an egg roll wrapper at her, which passed through the spot she had just vacated and stuck to the wall on the opposite side of the hall. He grinned when he heard her laughter echoing through the apartment.  
“什么？你不能同时做这两件事？我嫁给了一个什么样的懒汉？”明日香回击，也眨了眨眼。真嗣伸出舌头，将一张鸡蛋卷纸扔向她，鸡蛋卷纸穿过她刚刚腾出的位置，贴在了大厅对面的墙上。当他听到她的笑声在公寓里回荡时，他笑了。

"Shinji, I can continue to make these if you need to answer the door. I may not have your skills, but I will do my best. I do not wish to see the two of you argue," Rei said as she gazed at her brother, who smiled and tried his best not to laugh.  
“真嗣，如果你需要开门，我可以继续做这些。我的技术可能没有你，但我会尽力而为。我不想看到你们两个吵架。”丽看着她说道。她的哥哥微笑着，努力不笑。

"No, it's okay, Rei! Asuka and I were just playing with each other," he answered, reassuring his sister that everything was alright. "Trust me, we weren't arguing for real. It's just another way of showing affection." Rei looked at him oddly, then continued to work on the egg rolls, making sure that she didn't add any meat to the ones she fixed.  
“不，没关系，丽！明日香和我只是在一起玩而已，”他回答道，向妹妹保证一切都好。 “相信我，我们并不是真的在争论。这只是表达爱意的另一种方式。”丽奇怪地看着他，然后继续做蛋卷，确保她做的蛋卷里没有添加任何肉。

Asuka grinned as she listened to her fiancé trying to explain the nuances of human relationships to his baffled sister. There was just something about that pale girl that grew on people, even Asuka, though it had taking quite a while for that to happen. Asuka just shook her head as she opened the door to see to their visitor. She gasped as soon as she saw who was standing there.  
当明日香听她的未婚夫试图向他困惑的妹妹解释人际关系的细微差别时，她笑了。那个苍白的女孩身上有一种在人们身上成长的东西，甚至是明日香，尽管这需要相当长的时间才能发生。明日香只是摇了摇头，打开门迎接来访者。当她看到站在那里的人时，她倒吸了一口气。

"Hello, Asuka," Fuyutsuki greeted as he stood outside the door, gazing at the Second Child. "How are you doing this evening?" He was aware of what happened earlier that day at the school, and was worried about her.  
“你好，明日香。”冬月站在门外，看着老二打招呼。 “你今晚过得怎么样？”他知道那天早些时候在学校发生的事情，并且很担心她。

"Oh! Commander Fuyutsuki! Hello!" Asuka answered, shocked to see the second-in-command of NERV standing at her door. "What can I do for you?"  
「哦！冬月指挥官！您好！」明日香接了电话，惊讶地发现NERV的二号人物站在她家门口。 “我能为你做什么？”

"I just came by to make sure everything was okay, and to deliver some things," the white-haired gentleman answered, "May I come in?" Asuka blinked, then suddenly jumped, as if startled. She had not ever expected to see him at the door, and it had caused her to forget her manners.  
“我只是来确认一下情况，送一些东西。”白发绅士道，“我可以进去吗？”明日香眨了眨眼睛，然后突然跳了起来，仿佛受到了惊吓。她没想到会在门口见到他，这让她忘记了自己的礼仪。

"Huh? Oh, I'm sorry! Come on in," she replied, red faced with shame as she stepped back to let the Sub-Commander in. He smiled gently as he walked passed her, before his eyes fell upon the egg roll wrapper plastered to the wall.  
“啊？哦，对不起！进来吧。”她羞得红了脸，退后一步让副指挥官进来。他从她身边走过时温柔地微笑着，然后目光落在了鸡蛋上。卷纸贴在墙上。

"Interesting choice of decorations," he said wryly as the young German quickly peeled it from the wall and hid it in her hand, "Did you find it at the local home renovation center?" His crooked smile showed her there was no malice to the comment, but she still blushed red and smiled nervously as she hid the wrapped behind her back.  
“装饰品的选择很有趣，”当年轻的德国人迅速将它从墙上剥下来并藏在她手里时，他挖苦地说，“你是在当地的家居装修中心找到的吗？”他歪歪扭扭的笑容让她明白这话并没有恶意，但她还是脸红了，紧张地笑了笑，把包裹藏在了背后。

"Uh well…," she said before turning toward the kitchen and calling out, "Shinji! We have a guest! Would you come in here please?" she asked through gritted teeth.  
“呃好吧……”她说道，然后转向厨房喊道，“真嗣！我们有客人！请进来一下好吗？”她咬牙切齿地问道。

"Sure, hon! What's up?" Shinji answered as he came around the corner, wiping his hands on a towel, "Ah! Good evening, Commander! What can we do for you tonight?"  
“当然，亲爱的！有什么事吗？”真嗣走到拐角处，一边用毛巾擦手一边回答道：“啊！指挥官晚上好！今晚有什么可以为您服务的吗？”

"I was just telling your bride-to-be that I came by to check up on you two and deliver a few things," Fuyutsuki replied as he peered past the young man and saw the First Child standing in the kitchen by the counter. He was struck at how much like her mother she appeared to be. "Good Evening, Rei. How are you tonight?"  
“我只是告诉你的准新娘，我来看看你们两个，并送一些东西。”冬月回答道，他的目光越过年轻人，看到大孩子站在厨房的柜台旁。他对她长得多么像她的母亲感到震惊。 “晚上好，丽。今晚怎么样？”

"Good evening, Commander. I am well, thank you," Rei answered as she continued to pour all her concentration in creating the perfect egg roll. "My brother is teaching me how to cook."  
“指挥官晚上好，我很好，谢谢您。”丽一边回答，一边继续全神贯注地制作完美的蛋卷。 “我哥哥正在教我做饭。”

"Ah, most excellent! I have always believed that families bonded best in the kitchen," Fuyutsuki said as he watched her in wonder. Shinji excused himself to help Rei finish up and to get drinks for everyone as Asuka guided the older man to the living room, but not before throwing the much abused wrapper back at Shinji and hitting him right between the eyes, giving him a warning glare.  
“啊，太棒了！我一直相信家庭在厨房里的关系最好。”冬月惊奇地看着她。当明日香引导年长的男人到客厅时，真嗣借口借口帮助丽完成工作并为每个人拿饮料，但在此之前，他把那张被严重滥用的包装纸扔回真嗣并打在他的眼睛之间，警告他瞪了他一眼。

"So, how are you doing, Asuka?" Fuyutsuki asked once more, _sotto voci_ so as to keep Shinji from overhearing everything. "After everything that has happened today and with your parents, I just wanted to come by and see how you were doing."  
“那么，你怎么样，明日香？”为了不让真嗣听到一切，冬月再次小声问道。 “在今天和你父母发生了这一切之后，我只是想过来看看你过得怎么样。”

"I'm…as well as can be expected," she sighed as she wiped a small tear that escaped as she and Fuyutsuki took seats across from each other, "It all still shocks me somewhat, especially today, but I have my family here to support me. That's all I need." She noticed the Commander's smile at what she had said.  
“我……正如你所料，”她叹了口气，擦掉了她和冬月对面座位上流下的一滴泪水，“这一切仍然让我有些震惊，尤其是今天，但我还有我的家人。”这就是我所需要的。”她注意到指挥官听到她的话露出了微笑。

"You know, Shinji isn't the only person I've seen grow the past several weeks," he said as the young German began to blush somewhat, "You have definitely made huge strides since I first saw you. You're more…well, for lack of a better word, _human_."  
“你知道，在过去的几周里，真嗣并不是我唯一看到成长的人，”当这位年轻的德国人开始有些脸红时，他说道，“自从我第一次见到你以来，你确实取得了巨大的进步。你比我第一次看到你进步了很多。” ……好吧，没有更好的词了，人类。”

"Well, I have learned that I can't do everything on my own, like I used to think," she replied as she tucked her legs up under herself, "and it definitely feels so much better to have those who love you around and supporting you."  
“嗯，我知道我不能像以前想的那样，独自完成所有事情，”她一边回答，一边把双腿盘在身下，“有那些爱你的人在身边，感觉肯定好多了。”并支持你。”

"Especially a certain young man?" Fuyutsuki prodded, causing Asuka to blush and smile at the same time.  
“尤其是某个年轻人？”冬月的一戳，让明日香脸红了，同时微笑了。

"Yes, especially Shinji," she answered, feeling the warmth in her heart the thought of the Third Child caused.  
“是的，尤其是真嗣，”她回答道，感受到第三个孩子的想法在她心中带来的温暖。

"Speaking of whom, are you sure you don't want him to know about what happened today?" Fuyutsuki wondered.  
“说起来，你确定不想让他知道今天发生的事情吗？”冬月疑惑道。

"I'm sure, and Rei agrees with me," Asuka said with certainty, nodding her head, "I don't want there to be any secrets between Shinji and myself. However, I have seen his darker side, and it does frighten me somewhat. I wouldn't want to think what would happen if he found out what happened today." Fuyutsuki nodded in reply.  
“我确定，丽也同意我的看法，”明日香点点头，肯定地说，“我不希望自己和真嗣之间有任何秘密。不过，我已经看到了他阴暗的一面，而且确实如此。”让我有点害怕。我不想去想如果他知道今天发生的事情会发生什么。”冬月点头回应。

"Well, you won't have to worry about those four again," he said with finality, "they have been placed in juvenile detention, and their families have been relocated from Tokyo-3 to Australia. It wasn't the families fault, but we didn't wish for them to remain anywhere near either you or the baby." Asuka set her jaw and nodded in agreement.  
“好吧，你不用再担心那四个人了，”他最后说道，“他们已经被关进少管所，他们的家人也从第三东京搬到了澳大利亚。这不是他们家人的错。” ，但我们不希望它们留在你或婴儿附近。”明日香咬紧牙关，点头同意。

"That's a relief! Thank you!," Asuka replied just as Shinji and Rei walked in carrying several cups of tea and handing one off to the older gentleman.  
“这真是一种解脱！谢谢你！”明日香回答道，这时真嗣和丽走进来，端着几杯茶，把一杯递给了年长的绅士。

"Thank you for what?" Shinji asked, a little baffled as he handed Asuka her cup and took a seat next to her.  
“谢谢什么？”真嗣有些困惑地问道，把杯子递给明日香，然后在她旁边坐下。

"Uh…for the tea, of course! Duh!" she quickly replied as Fuyutsuki hid his smile behind his own cup, and gave the Second Child a quick wink. Asuka breathed a sigh of relief as Shinji accepted the answer and sat back and relaxed.  
“呃……当然是为了茶！呃！”她很快回答道，冬月把笑容藏在自己的杯子后面，对老二眨了眨眼。当真嗣接受了答案并放松地坐下来时，明日香松了口气。

"You're welcome," Shinji replied as he began to drink his tea and began to wonder why Rei, Asuka and Fuyutsuki were looking at each other so strangely. _"It's just my imagination, I guess. Stress from the up coming wedding'"_ he reasoned as the looks quickly vanished.  
“不客气，”真嗣回答道，他开始喝茶，并开始奇怪为什么丽、明日香和冬月会如此奇怪地看着对方。 “我想，这只是我的想象。即将举行的婚礼带来的压力”，他推理道，但这些表情很快就消失了。

"So, how are the plans for the wedding coming along? Everything working out?" the Commander asked.  
“那么，婚礼的计划进行得怎么样了？一切进展顺利吗？”指挥官问道。

"So far, so good," Asuka replied before frowning a little, "but I feel like there are still so many things left to do. I never did get to thank you for allowing us to use the Great Hall for the wedding! That helped out so very much!"  
“到目前为止，还不错，”明日香回答道，然后皱起眉头，“但我觉得还有很多事情要做。我一直没有感谢你允许我们使用大厅举行婚礼！那个帮了很大的忙！”

"Actually, that was Commander Ikari's idea," Fuyutsuki replied, then grinned mischievously, "but I'm more than willing to take the credit for it if that makes you happy!" The three pilots chuckled at his comment, and were slightly shocked at seeing that side of Fuyutsuki, even though others had sworn it was there. They had never really seen it before.  
“其实，这是碇司令的主意，”冬月回答道，然后调皮地笑了笑，“不过如果这能让你高兴的话，我很乐意接受这个功劳！”三名飞行员听到他的评论咯咯地笑起来，看到冬月的那一面时感到有些震惊，尽管其他人发誓它就在那里。他们以前从未真正见过它。

"Are you going to be there, Commander?" Rei asked, her crimson eyes locking onto his. "Will Commander Ikari be there as well?"  
“指挥官你要去吗？”丽用猩红的眼睛盯着他问道。 「碇司令也会去吗？」

"I wouldn't miss this for the world, believe me. It's not everyday that you get to see the child of your best student get married," Fuyutsuki replied as he watched Shinji beam at the thought of his mother, "Especially after helping to change his diapers when he was a baby! I swear, I'm not sure what Yui fed you, but it always came out as toxic waste! That stuff should be banned by the Geneva Conventions." Shinji turned ten shades of red as Rei and Asuka burst out in laughter, sending sprays of tea around the room as Fuyutsuki merely smiled.  
“我不会错过这个，相信我。你不是每天都能看到你最好的学生的孩子结婚的，”冬月回答道，他看着真嗣因想起他的母亲而微笑，“尤其是在帮助了他之后。”当他还是个婴儿的时候就给他换尿布！我发誓，我不知道Yui给你喂了什么，但那东西总是有毒废物！”真嗣脸色涨红了十度，丽和明日香大笑起来，茶水喷洒在房间里，而冬月只是微笑。

" _Et tu,_ Commander?" Shinji moaned, covering his face with his hand, "_Et tu?"_  
“那么，指挥官？”真嗣用手捂住脸，呻吟了一声，“是吗？”

"Sorry about that, Captain, I just couldn't resist," the white haired man chuckled as he pulled several envelopes from his jacket. "To answer your question, Rei, the Commander regrets that he will not be able to attend…"  
“抱歉，队长，我实在忍不住了。”白发男子轻笑一声，从外套里取出几个信封。 “回答你的问题，雷，指挥官很遗憾他不能参加……”

"Figures," Shinji muttered sadly, causing his fiancée to reach over and pat his hand, trying to comfort him.  
“数字。”真嗣悲伤地低声说道，他的未婚妻伸手拍了拍他的手，试图安慰他。

"But he did send his wedding gift for me to deliver," Fuyutsuki continued, trying to ignore the hurt look on Shinji's face. He passed the first envelope over to Asuka, who looked at it strangely before deciding it wasn't a bomb and proceeded to tear it open.  
“但他确实把他的结婚礼物送给了我，”冬月继续说道，试图忽略真嗣脸上受伤的表情。他把第一个信封递给明日香，明日香奇怪地看着它，然后决定这不是炸弹，然后把它撕开。

"What…what is all this?" the red head asked as she pulled several legal documents from the folder and began to read over them, her eyes glistening as they threatened to overflow. Shinji leaned over and read them with her.  
“这……这到底是什么？”红发问道，她从文件夹中取出几份法律文件，开始阅读起来，她的眼睛闪闪发亮，快要溢出来了。真嗣俯身和她一起读。

"That, my dear, is your inheritance. Your mother left everything to you in her will, to be held in trust by your father until such time as you were eighteen, or declared an adult. The wedding license issued to you and Shinji is such a declaration in the eyes of the law." He purposely neglected to tell her about the legal emancipation documents that NERV had in it's possession.  
“亲爱的，那是你的遗产。你母亲在遗嘱中把一切都留给了你，由你父亲保管，直到你十八岁，或者宣布成年。颁发给你和真嗣的结婚证是从法律角度来看，这样的声明。”他故意忽略告诉她 NERV 拥有的合法解放文件。

"Shinji, do you know what this means?" Asuka asked excitedly as she continued to peruse the documents in her hand.  
“慎二，你知道这意味着什么吗？”明日香一边继续翻阅手中的文件，一边兴奋地问道。

"Well, it looks like you've inherited several large tracts of land, as well as quite a few rather large houses," Shinji answered, trying to keep his voice as calm as possible.  
“嗯，看来你继承了几大片土地，还有不少相当大的房子。”真嗣回答道，尽量让声音保持平静。

"Along with a vast amount of money," Fuyutsuki added, making Shinji want to get up and tear the tongue from his head. Rei saw a brief flash of sadness in Shinji's eyes, but kept quiet.  
“还有一大笔钱。”冬月补充道，真嗣想要站起来，把舌头从头上扯下来。丽看到真嗣眼中闪过一丝悲伤，但还是保持沉默。

"It means that we have a place to go when all this Angel crap is over with! We have a place to retire when we get older, and we have a place to raise our children!" Asuka said as her eyes took on a far away look, thinking back to the large tracts of forests she and Heidi used to take walks in back in younger days. Shinji seemed to brighten after hearing all this, especially the part about raising _their children_. Asuka reached over and gave Shinji a joyous hug.  
“这意味着当所有这些天使的废话结束后，我们有一个地方可以去！当我们变老时，我们有一个地方可以退休，我们有一个地方可以抚养我们的孩子！”明日香一边说着，一边看着远处的景色，回想起年轻时和海蒂一起散步的大片森林。听到这一切，真嗣似乎精神一振，尤其是关于抚养孩子的部分。明日香伸出手来，给了真嗣一个快乐的拥抱。

"I'll pass your thanks on to the Commander," Fuyutsuki said with a smile, knowing that the children would never believe that the Commander really did give them this as a gift. _"Deep down, Gendo cares for his children, but refuses to show it. He covers it in intrigues and plots and plans of his own. I really fear that may be his downfall one day,"_ Fuyutsuki thought to himself.  
“我会向指挥官转达你们的谢意。”冬月笑着说道，他知道孩子们绝对不会相信指挥官真的把这个当作礼物送给了他们。 “在内心深处，源堂关心他的孩子，但拒绝表现出来。他用自己的阴谋、阴谋和计划来掩盖这一点。我真的担心有一天这可能会成为他的垮台。”冬月心想。

"I have never known of the Commander doing anything so magnanimous for anyone before," Rei said softly as Fuyutsuki cleared his throat to continue.  
“我从来不知道指挥官会对任何人做出如此大度的事情。”雷轻声说道，冬月清了清嗓子继续说道。

"This is my gift to you two" he said as he handed another envelope over, this one to Shinji. The younger man promptly opened it and pull its contents out into the open. The three children sat in shock as they stared at two airline tickets, as well as the other documents that fell into Shinji's lap.  
“这是我送给你们两个的礼物，”他一边说着，一边将另一个信封递给真嗣。年轻人立即打开它，把里面的东西拿出来。三个孩子震惊地坐在那儿，盯着两张机票，以及落在真嗣腿上的其他文件。

"Are these really…?" Shinji stammered while Asuka grabbed the stuff that had fallen, staring at them in disbelief as well.  
“这些真的是……？”真嗣结结巴巴地说道，而明日香则抓住了掉落的东西，同样不可置信地看着它们。

"Yes. Two tickets to Okinawa, along with reservations to the finest hotel on the island," Fuyutsuki replied. "I know you two missed your school trip there several years back, and I was hoping to make it up to you. I like this town, but Tokyo-3 really isn't the best spot in the world for a honeymoon. I hope you two didn't already have plans, if so, then you can always cancel…"  
“是的。两张去冲绳的机票，还有岛上最好的酒店的预订。”冬月回答道。 “我知道你们两个错过了几年前的学校旅行，我希望能弥补你们。我喜欢这个小镇，但第三东京确实不是世界上最好的蜜月地点。我希望你们两个还没有计划，如果有的话，那你们可以随时取消……”

"Uh, no, we didn't have any plans, Commander," Shinji replied it total shock. He turned to his fiancée to make sure, and saw that her jaw was in her lap. This was something she had definitely not expected. "To tell the truth, we hadn't really thought about it! With everything that has happened lately, it never really crossed our mind."  
“呃，不，我们没有任何计划，指挥官。”真嗣震惊地回答道。他转向未婚妻确认，发现她的下巴正放在腿上。这绝对是她万万没想到的。 “说实话，我们并没有真正想过这个问题！最近发生的一切，我们从来没有真正想过。”

"I had thought as much," the older man chuckled, enjoying the looks on their faces.  
“我也是这么想的，”年长的男人咯咯笑着，欣赏着他们脸上的表情。

"But what about the Angels?" Asuka wondered, "That's why we couldn't go last time! What if you need Shinji?" Fuyutsuki shook his head as he continued to smile.  
“但是天使呢？”明日香疑惑道：“所以上次我们没能去！如果你需要真嗣怎么办？”冬月摇摇头，继续微笑。

"Arrangements have been made, Asuka. Rei will still be here on call. There will be a high speed transport on standby at all times at the airbase in Okinawa to retrieve you both in the event of an attack. I just want to two of you to go on your honeymoon and relax! Try not to think about NERV, Angels, or crotchety old commanders. Just enjoy spending time with each other and live a little. It's all this old man can ask of you."  
“安排已经做好了，明日香。丽仍会随时待命。冲绳空军基地将有一辆高速运输机随时待命，以便在发生袭击时接回你们俩。我只想找两个你们去度蜜月，放松一下吧！尽量不要去想NERV、天使或者脾气暴躁的老指挥官们，享受彼此相处的时光，好好生活，这就是老家伙对你们的全部要求了。”

"Commander, I don't know what to say," Asuka said, which was strange in itself. _"I'm never left speechless,"_ she thought. Then something flashed in her mind, one little detail that she had not been able to work out with the recent turn of events. She knew what to do, how to thank him properly.  
“指挥官，我不知道该说什么。”明日香的声音本身就很奇怪。 “我从来没有哑口无言，”她想。然后她脑子里闪过一些东西，一个小细节，由于最近发生的事态发展，她一直无法弄清楚。她知道该怎么做，如何恰当地感谢他。

"Uh, Commander, I do want to ask you for something else, if I can. After everything that happened with my father, there is something …uh…well…_missing_ from my wedding," she said, rather timidly. She swallowed and looked over to Shinji, who gave her hand a soft squeeze and a small nod. He knew what it was she was planning, and he approved.  
“呃，指挥官，如果可以的话，我确实想向您求点别的东西。在我父亲发生了这一切之后，我的婚礼……呃……好吧……缺少了一些东西，”她相当胆怯地说。她咽了口口水，看向真嗣，真嗣轻轻捏了捏她的手，轻轻点了点头。他知道她的打算，也同意了。

"I'll do anything I can to help," Fuyutsuki replied gently, having no idea of what Asuka had in store for him.  
“我会尽我所能来帮助你。”冬月温柔地回答道，他不知道明日香为他准备了什么。

"Well, since my father pretty much walked out of my life…uh… and since I can't find the right way to thank you for your gift," she continued. She really hated feeling so unconfident, so timid. _"Damn hormones!"_ she cursed silently. " I was wondering if…maybe… you could, uh, give me away at the wedding?"  
“好吧，因为我父亲几乎已经从我的生活中消失了……呃……而且我找不到正确的方式来感谢你的礼物，”她继续说道。她真的很讨厌这种没有自信、胆怯的感觉。 “该死的荷尔蒙！”她低声咒骂道。 “我想知道……也许……你可以，呃，在婚礼上把我送走吗？”

Commander Fuyutsuki had seen many things in his long life that he never thought we would see. He saw his best student fall in love and marry the biggest bastard he had ever met. He saw the tapes of the total destruction of an entire continent following a failed contact experiment. He saw scientists grow huge monstrosities to fight other huge monstrosities. He saw his best student die before his eyes, and saw the creation of an altered clone of her. He saw his commander abandon his own son with no regard to the child's welfare, then watched him use that son later on to battle for Mankind's existence. He saw the fulfillment of prophesies that were thousands of years old. All of that paled in comparison to seeing the loud, obnoxious Second Child reduced to the frightened teenager she really was, and having that scared teenager ask him to give her away at her wedding.  
冬月指挥官在他漫长的一生中看到了许多他从未想过我们会看到的事情。他看到他最好的学生坠入爱河并嫁给了他见过的最大的私生子。他看到了一次失败的接触实验后整个大陆被彻底毁灭的录像带。他看到科学家们培育出巨大的怪物来对抗其他巨大的怪物。他亲眼目睹了自己最好的学生在自己面前死去，并目睹了她的克隆体的诞生。他看到他的指挥官抛弃了自己的儿子，不顾孩子的福祉，然后又看着他利用这个儿子为人类的生存而战。他看到了几千年前的预言的应验。与看到那个吵闹、令人讨厌的第二个孩子变成一个受惊的青少年相比，所有这一切都显得苍白无力，而那个受惊的青少年要求他在她的婚礼上把她送走。

"It…it would be my pleasure, Asuka," he replied passed the lump that had formed in his throat. In all his years, he would have never believed that Asuka would ever ask him to stand in as her father. He stood as said redhead leapt up and wrapped him up in an all encompassing hug. "It will be my pleasure."  
“这……这是我的荣幸，明日香。”他回答道，喉咙里已经形成了肿块。在他这些年里，他从来不相信明日香会要求他代替她的父亲。当他站起来时，红发女郎跳了起来，将他包裹在一个拥抱中。 “这将是我的荣幸。”

"Thank you," she whispered in his ear just before the two broke away from the hug and sat back down. Suddenly, there was now one more person to add to the wedding party, and plans had to be made.  
“谢谢你。”她在他耳边低声说道，然后两人挣脱了拥抱，重新坐下。突然间，婚礼上又多了一个人，必须制定计划了。

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Shinji?" Rei said as she stood next to her brother, who was carefully dropping the egg rolls into the wok filled with hot oil and watching them turn a golden brown color. "Can I ask you about something?"  
“真嗣？”丽站在哥哥旁边说道，哥哥正小心翼翼地将蛋卷放入装满热油的炒锅中，看着它们变成金黄色。 “我可以问你一件事吗？”

"Sure, Rei. Anything at all!" he replied as he used his ladle to make sure all sides of the rolls were evenly cooked. He hated an uneven color on his egg rolls.  
“当然，丽。什么都可以！”他边回答边用勺子确保面包卷的每一面都均匀地煮熟。他讨厌蛋卷颜色不均匀。

"When Commander Fuyutsuki gave Asuka the gift from Commander Ikari, I saw sadness in your eyes for just a moment. Then afterward, you were happy again. May I ask what was wrong?" Shinji sighed as he tried to gather his thoughts.  
「当冬月司令把碇司令送给明日香的礼物交给明日香的时候，我看到你的眼神里有那么一瞬间的悲伤，但随后又变得高兴起来。请问你出了什么问题吗？」真嗣叹了口气，努力整理思绪。

"Uh, well, It's kind of complicated," he said as he continued to watch the egg rolls, not wanting to make eye contact with his sister. He felt shameful at the feeling that had flooded his heart when he saw Asuka's gift. "I was so happy for Asuka when she got her inheritance, but then it hit me. I knew that Asuka and the baby were now going to be taken care of no matter what I did. So, for a second or two, I wondered if Asuka would want to still marry me. It broke my heart to think that maybe she wouldn't want to be with me any more."  
“呃，好吧，这有点复杂，”他一边说，一边继续看着蛋卷，不想与他的妹妹进行目光接触。当他看到明日香的礼物时，他感到羞愧。 “当明日香获得继承权时，我为她感到非常高兴，但后来我突然想到了。我知道无论我做什么，明日香和孩子现在都会得到照顾。所以，有那么一两秒钟，我想知道如果明日香还想嫁给我的话，一想到她可能不想再和我在一起了，我的心就碎了。”

"Shinji…" Rei started, her eyes focusing beyond her brother as he continued his story.  
“真嗣……”丽开口说道，当他继续讲故事时，她的目光落在了哥哥身上。

" Then she that we would have a place to raise _our children_, to retire to when we grew old together. I doubted her for just a minute, and I felt like I betrayed her. It was a selfish thought, and I'm ashamed of it. I love her so much, but I guess my old insecurities haven't been laid to rest just yet. I guess a lifetime of being used, unwanted, and unloved doesn't go away over night." he said sadly as he removed the rolls from the wok and added more to the hot oil.  
“然后她说我们会有一个地方来抚养我们的孩子，当我们一起变老时可以退休。我怀疑了她一分钟，我觉得我背叛了她。这是一个自私的想法，我感到羞耻我非常爱她，但我想我过去的不安全感还没有消除，我想我一生中被利用、不受欢迎和不被爱的状态不会在一夜之间消失。”他悲伤地说，一边把面包卷从锅里拿出来，又往热油里加了一些。

"You big dummy," he heard someone say gently as he felt arms wrap around his waist. He stiffened for a second before relaxing in the arms of his beloved, as she laid her chin on his shoulder and lean her head into his. He closed his eyes as warmth filled him, driving the loneliness away once more, banishing it back to the far recesses of his heart and mind.  
“你这个大笨蛋。”他听见有人温柔地说，他感觉到手臂环住了他的腰。他僵硬了一秒钟，然后在他心爱的人的怀里放松下来，她把下巴靠在他的肩膀上，把头靠在他的身上。他闭上眼睛，温暖充满了他的身体，再次驱散了孤独，将它驱逐回了他心灵的最深处。

"I'm sorry, Asuka," he said sadly as he drew strength from her, his head hanging in shame.  
“我很抱歉，明日香。”他悲伤地说道，同时从她身上汲取力量，羞愧地低下了头。

"Shush," she whispered in his ear. "We all have our doubts, sometimes. We all have our fears. But you better remember this: You're mine, Ikari! I love you. I'll never leave you, and I'll never use you. Unless you wish to be used," she said mischievously as she nibble his ear.  
“嘘，”她在他耳边低声说道。 “有时我们都会有怀疑。我们都有恐惧。但你最好记住这一点：你是我的，碇！我爱你。我永远不会离开你，也永远不会使用你。除非你愿意被利用了。”她顽皮地说，一边咬着他的耳朵。

"Asuka!" he gasped, turning several shades of red as she giggled in response. He quickly joined her as he turned in her arms and hugged her back, giving her a quick kiss. "Maybe later!" he added as he wiggled his eyebrows, causing her to redden in turn.  
“明日香！”他喘息着，当她咯咯地笑着回应时，他的脸色变红了几度。他迅速加入了她的怀抱，回抱住她，给了她一个飞快的吻。 “也许以后吧！”他补充道，同时摇动眉毛，让她脸红了。

"You have got to quit taking Kaji lessons," Rei added, making the couple blush even more due to the fact they had forgotten she was there. Their jaws dropped at what she had said, bringing a small smile to her lips. All three then joined in a quick chuckle before returning to preparing the evening meal. They knew how cranky Heidi and Misato would be if they got home from shopping and dinner wasn't ready.  
“你必须停止上加持课程，”丽补充道，这让这对夫妇脸更红了，因为他们忘记了她在那里。他们听了她的话，下巴都掉了下来，她的嘴角露出一丝微笑。然后三个人一起轻声笑了起来，然后继续准备晚餐。他们知道，如果海蒂和美里买完东西回家，晚餐还没准备好，会有多暴躁。

_Thursday, D-Day minus two…  
星期四，诺曼底登陆日减去两点……_

"Come on, guys! I still have homework to do! I don't have time for this!" Shinji protested as he struggled forward, moving slowly so as not to stumble. The blindfold that covered his eyes was secured rather well, so there was no chance of it slipping, allowing him to see where he was being led.  
“来吧，伙计们！我还有作业要做！我没有时间做这个！”真嗣一边抗议，一边挣扎着向前走，为了不绊倒，动作缓慢。遮住眼睛的眼罩固定得很好，根本没有滑落的可能，让他能够看到自己被带到了哪里。

"Tough!" barked Touji as he pushed Shinji forward, "You have more important things to do than sit on your butt and do schoolwork!"  
“艰难的！”东次一边叫道，一边推着真嗣往前走，“你还有比坐在屁股上做功课更重要的事情要做！”

"Yeah!" added Kensuke, "Much more important! We were sent to ensure the success of this mission!"  
“是的！”健介补充道：“更重要的是！我们被派来是为了确保这次任务的成功！”

"And what the hell sort of mission is that?" Shinji retorted as he was pushed through a doorway, as the smell of alcohol and the blaring of music struck him suddenly.  
“那到底是什么任务？”当真嗣被推进门口时，酒气和刺耳的音乐突然扑面而来，真嗣反驳道。

"It's the worst sort of mission, Pilot Ikari!" Touji added as he continued to shove Shinji forward.  
“这是最糟糕的任务，碇飞行员！”东次一边补充道，一边继续推着真嗣前进。

"That's 'Captain Ikari' to you, Pilot Suzahara," Shinji growled, clearly not very happy at being forced from his apartment. While he did have homework to do, he was really looking forward to spending the evening with Asuka. As of now, however, that plan had been ruined by his two idiot friends.  
“对你来说，这就是‘碇船长’，须佐原飞行员。”真嗣咆哮道，显然对于被迫离开自己的公寓不太高兴。虽然他确实有作业要做，但他真的很期待与明日香共度夜晚。然而现在，这个计划却被他的两个白痴朋友破坏了。

"Yeah, Touji, it's 'Captain Ikari'! Dumbass!" Kensuke chimed in, mirth clearly in his voice. His friend looked at him and gave him a dirty look.  
“是啊，东二，是‘碇队长’！笨蛋！”健介插话道，声音里明显带着笑意。他的朋友看着他，并用一种​​鄙视的眼神看着他。

"Okay, whatever! That doesn't change the fact that we have a mission!" Touji shot back as he guided the young Captain to a chair and sat him in it.  
“好吧，无论如何！这并不能改变我们有使命的事实！”东治反击道，他把年轻的船长引到一张椅子上，让他坐下。

"What kind of mission?" Shinji barked, trying to make himself heard over the din that someone had obviously thought was music. Shinji was ready to go grab a cello and beat whoever had written the stuff over the head with it, then shove a trombone into a body orifice where the sun would never shine.  
“什么样的任务？”真嗣咆哮着，试图让自己的声音盖过别人显然认为是音乐的喧闹声。真嗣准备去抓起一把大提琴，殴打那些用它在头上写下这些东西的人，然后将长号塞进阳光永远照射不到的身体孔口。

"Being the honor guard at a funeral, Captain," a familiar voice called out as Touji removed the blindfold, revealing the spectacle before Shinji. "Yours, to be exact."  
“作为葬礼上的仪仗队，队长，”当东次摘下眼罩时，一个熟悉的声音喊道，展现在真嗣面前的景象。 “准确地说，是你的。”

_"Aw crap,"_ Shinji thought as he saw his best man standing before him, a rather crafty grin on his face. Kaji looked like a cat that had just eaten a canary as he stood back and let Shinji see what had been done for him.  
“噢，糟糕，”当真嗣看到他的伴郎站在他面前时，他心里想，脸上挂着狡猾的笑容。加治就像一只刚刚吃了金丝雀的猫，他往后退了一步，让真嗣看看他们为他做了什么。

"Surprise!!" yelled many voices, temporarily overpowering the noise..er..music that filled what was obviously a darkly lit nightclub. Looking around, Shinji saw a huge sign reading 'We'll miss you, Captain!', as well as many sympathy cards lining the tables, each and every one mourning the imminent passing of his bachelorhood. Tables were piled with various snacks and drinks, most of which were alcoholic in nature. He saw many of the male technicians he worked with at NERV, chief of which were Shigeru and Makoto. Commander Fuyutsuki sat at the same table as the two techs, slowly sipping from a glass and trying not to grimace at each and every sour note the band in the corner made.  
“惊喜！！”许多声音大喊大叫，暂时压倒了噪音……呃……音乐，显然是一个灯光昏暗的夜总会。环顾四周，真嗣看到了一个巨大的牌子，上面写着“我们会想念你，船长！”，桌子上还摆着许多慰问卡，每一张都在哀悼他即将结束的单身生活。桌子上堆满了各种小吃和饮料，其中大部分都是酒精性质的。他在NERV见到了许多与他一起工作的男性技术人员，其中的负责人是Shigeru和Makoto。冬月指挥官和两名技术人员坐在同一张桌子上，慢慢地喝着一杯酒，并努力不因为角落里的乐队发出的每一个酸味音符而皱起眉头。

Everyone stood and rushed forward to shake Shinji's hand and to offer their condolences, causing his eyes to bug out for a split second. Shinji had always hated crowds, and now this one was aimed directly at him. He would have given anything at that moment in time to be in the entry plug of Unit One and wading through the assembled sea of bodies. He looked up and saw Kaji standing at the front of the room, his arms crossed and laughing hardily at Shinji's discomfort.  
大家起身冲上前去与真嗣握手表示哀悼，让真嗣的眼睛一瞬间瞪大了。真嗣一向讨厌人群，而现在这个人却直接针对他。在那一刻，他愿意付出任何代价，及时进入一号机组的入口塞，涉过聚集的尸体海洋。他抬起头，看到加持站在房间的前面，双臂交叉，对真嗣的不适强颜欢笑。

_"He should laugh,"_ Shinji growled in his thoughts as he plastered a false smile on his face and greeted everyone who spoke to him and shook his hand. _"He's the one who set all this up! I'll get him back, somehow!"_  
“他应该笑，”真嗣在心里咆哮道，脸上挂着虚假的微笑，向每个与他说话的人打招呼，并与他握手。 “他就是这一切的始作俑者！我一定会把他找回来，不管怎样！”

"Okay, okay! Everyone, give the good Captain some room!" Kaji called out as everyone took a seat and Touji lead Shinji to the front to sit before the assembled crowd. "Now, as you all know, including the obviously befuddled captain, that we are here this evening to mourn the passing of a fine young man. It is with grace that he marches forth toward his doom…" Suddenly the lights dimmed even more as a picture was projected on the back wall behind Shinji, showing Unit One buried head down, placed there rather unceremoniously by the Seventh Angel. Laughter burst out around the room as Shinji turned red-faced and glared at the unshaven gentleman who gave him a quick wink.  
“好吧好吧！大家给好队长一点空间吧！”当大家入座时，梶大声喊道，东司带领真嗣走到前面，在聚集的人群面前坐下。 “现在，正如你们所有人，包括明显糊涂的船长都知道的那样，今晚我们在这里哀悼一位优秀年轻人的去世。他优雅地走向他的厄运……”突然，灯光变得更加暗淡，真嗣身后的后墙上投影出一张照片，显示一号机头朝下埋着，被第七天使毫不客气地放在那里。房间里爆发出笑声，真嗣涨红了脸，瞪着那位胡子拉碴的绅士，后者对他眨了眨眼睛。

"It is with courage that he faces his dark destiny…," Kaji continued as another picture was projected, this one of Shinji running for his life from a extremely irate Second Child, who looked like she was going to pummel him to death with the book bag she had in her hand. Shinji remembered the incident, and shot Kensuke a withering glare. Kensuke merely smiled and turned back toward the presentation.  
“他有勇气面对自己黑暗的命运……”梶继续说道，同时投影出另一张照片，这张照片是真嗣从极其愤怒的老二手中逃命的，老二看起来像是要用那把棍子把他打死。她手里提着书包。真嗣想起了这件事，狠狠地瞪了剑介一眼。健介只是笑了笑，然后转身继续看演示。

"It is with honor that he descends down the path of destruction…" said the pony-tailed man as a picture of a startled Shinji, clad only in a towel as he left the bathroom of his old apartment appeared before crowd.  
“他很荣幸地走上了毁灭之路……”马尾辫男子说道，此时，一张受到惊吓的真嗣的照片出现在人群面前，他只裹着毛巾，离开了旧公寓的浴室。

"I'm going to kill him, I'm going to kill him, I'm going to kill him…" Shinji muttered softly under his breath as he felt a hand placed on his shoulder.  
“我要杀了他，我要杀了他，我要杀了他……”真嗣感觉到一只手放在了他的肩膀上，低声呢喃道。

"Which one?" Commander Fuyutsuki asked as he took a seat next to Shinji, "Kaji, Kensuke, or Touji?"  
“哪一个？”冬月指挥官在真嗣旁边坐下，问道：“梶、健介，还是东次？”

"All three," Shinji replied over the peals of laughter that reverberated throughout the club. The Commander smiled sagely.  
“三个人，”真嗣回答道，笑声响彻整个俱乐部。指挥官露出睿智的笑容。

"Well, at least they got your favorite band to play for you. I would have never thought you were a fan of theirs, I always pegged you for a classical guy." Shinji rolled his eyes at that.  
“好吧，至少他们有你最喜欢的乐队为你演奏。我从来没想过你是他们的粉丝，我一直认为你是一个古典的家伙。”真嗣对此翻了个白眼。

"I am. _Orgasmo and the Flatulent Five_ are Touji's favorite band, not mine! I would have preferred a string quartet." Shinji replied as he cast a wary eye toward the so-called musicians who continued to strangle cats in the corner of the room.  
“是的。Orgasmo 和 Flatulent Five 是 Touji 最喜欢的乐队，不是我的！我更喜欢弦乐四重奏。”真嗣一边回答，一边将警惕的目光投向那些继续在房间角落里勒死猫的所谓音乐家。

"Ah. That explains why he was so insistent on them playing here. Perhaps I should arrange some extra sync tests for the Fourth Child. In the nude. In extra cold LCL. Along with a hearing test." Fuyutsuki said as he stuck his little finger in his ear, wriggling it to see if he could get the hearing to return to it sometime soon.  
“啊。这解释了为什么他如此坚持让他们在这里玩。也许我应该为第四个孩子安排一些额外的同步测试。裸体。在特别寒冷的拼箱中。还有听力测试。”冬月一边说着，一边将小指伸进耳朵里，扭动着耳朵，看看能否很快让听力恢复过来。

"I think that would be appropriate," Shinji replied with a devious grin, causing the older man to chuckle before he nudged Shinji to turn his attention back to the presentation.  
“我认为这样比较合适，”真嗣狡黠地笑着回答，年长的男人咯咯地笑了起来，然后他用肘轻轻推了真嗣，让他把注意力转回演讲上。

"But in all seriousness, folks," Kaji said, the playfulness subdued, but the good spirits still clearly evident. Kaji turned and watched the pictures that were now progressing across the wall, either of Shinji in uniform, in a plug suit, or that of Unit One in combat. "We are here to wish a fine young man all the best in the world. He has taken up responsibilities that normal guys would run from in a heartbeat. He has laid his life down again and again to protect people who don't even know that he exists. He has reached out and captured the heart of a beautiful young lady, and he has freely given his mind, body and heart to her. He faced down an impossible beast to make sure that she would be happy and content." This brought a small cough from the furthest corner of the room. Kaji just smiled and continued on.  
“不过说实话，各位，”卡吉说道，玩笑的气氛减弱了，但良好的精神状态仍然清晰可见。加治转过身来，看着墙上的照片，要么是真嗣穿着制服、穿着插头服的照片，要么是一号机在战斗中的照片。 “我们在这里祝愿一个优秀的年轻人在世界上一切顺利。他承担了正常人会轻易逃避的责任。他一次又一次地牺牲自己的生命，以保护那些甚至不知道的人他的存在抓住了一位美丽年轻女士的心，他将自己的思想、身体和心灵自由地奉献给了她，以确保她幸福和满足。”这让房间最远的角落里传来一阵轻微的咳嗽声。梶只是微笑着继续前行。

"He is one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet, and one of the fiercest warriors any enemy has had the displeasure to come up against. He has helped and comforted the young, while bringing down both man and monster. So, it is to you, Captain Shinji Ikari, the Third Child, the Pilot of Evangelion Unit One, the Commander of NERV Combat Groups and the Elite Guards…"  
“他是你见过的最好的人之一，也是任何敌人都不愿意遇到的最凶猛的战士之一。他帮助和安慰了年轻人，同时打倒了人类和怪物。所以，它是你，碇真司队长、三号子、新世纪福音战士一号机飞行员、NERV战斗群和精锐卫队的指挥官……”

_"Huh?"_ Shinji thought, _"When the hell did that happen?"_ He felt Fuyutsuki pat him on the shoulder as he gave him a quick wink.  
“嗯？”真嗣心想：“这到底是什么时候发生的？”他感觉到冬月拍了拍他的肩膀，并给他眨了眨眼。

"…betrothed of the Second Child, son of Yui and Gendo Ikari, and my friend, that we offer you this toast. Gentlemen!" Kaji called out as every man stood as one before the shocked young man and held out their drinks. "Salute!"  
“......第二个孩子的未婚夫，Yui 和 Gendo Ikari 的儿子，也是我的朋友，我们为你们敬酒。先生们！”当每个人都站到震惊的年轻人面前并递上饮料时，卡吉喊道。 “礼炮！”

"HOO-RAH!!" all voices called out as one, shaking Shinji to the very core as he picked up his glass with a trembling hand and held the drink out to the assembled crowd. As one, in perfect sync, he and all the others downed their drinks and slammed the glasses on the tables. It was then that the party really started.  
“呼啦！！”所有的声音齐声呼喊，让真嗣浑身颤抖，他用颤抖的手拿起杯子，把饮料递给聚集的人群。他和其他人一齐喝完酒，把杯子摔在桌子上。就在那时，聚会才真正开始。

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_"Lord, I wish this was over,"_ Shinji typed into his cellphone as inconspicuously as he could. It wasn't like anyone would have noticed. The alcohol was flowing freely, and after a hour and a half, many in the party were feeling no pain_. "I miss you!"_  
“主啊，我希望这一切都结束了。”真嗣尽可能不引人注意地在手机上打字。这不像是任何人都会注意到的。酒精在自由地流动，一个半小时后，聚会中的许多人都感觉不到疼痛。 “我想你！”

_"Aww, poor baby,"_ the reply came back, _"It can't be too bad! You should have seen what Misato did at the bridal shower! Your party can't be as bad as that!"_  
“哇哦，可怜的宝贝，”回复回来了，“这不会太糟糕！你应该看看美里在新娘送礼会上所做的事情！你的派对不会那么糟糕！”

_"You'd be surprised,"_ Shinji typed back. He nervously glanced at the stack of gifts his friends had given him. Some were practical, like the lacy blue garter that Kaji had given him to remove from Asuka's leg at the reception. Some were well intentioned, like the twenty different boxes of condoms he was supplied with, along with the tasteful medical and scientific manuals that were given to him to help with…_marital relations_. Some were jokes, like the large nose ring he was supplied with so Asuka could lead him by the nose easier. Some were embarrassing and somewhat distasteful, like just about everything Touji, Kensuke, and Shigeru gave him. _"The gifts are something else!"_  
“你会感到惊讶的，”真嗣回道。他紧张地看了一眼朋友们送给他的一堆礼物。有些是实用的，比如在招待会上梶给他从明日香腿上取下的蓝色蕾丝吊袜带。有些是出于好意，比如为他提供的二十盒不同的避孕套，以及为帮助他处理……婚姻关系而提供的雅致的医学和科学手册。有些是笑话，比如他配备的大鼻环，这样明日香就可以更轻松地牵着他的鼻子。有些是令人尴尬的，甚至有些令人厌恶，就像东司、健介和茂给他的几乎所有东西一样。 “礼物是别的东西！”

_"Like all the lingerie that Misato gave me? Or like the copy of the Kama Sutra that your sister gave me?"_ Asuka texted back.  
“喜欢美里送我的所有内衣？还是喜欢你姐姐送我的那本《爱经》？”明日香回了短信。

_"Now, now. Rei was just being thoughtful,"_ he sent back, chuckling to himself.  
“现在，现在。雷只是想得很周到，”他回信说，暗自窃笑。

_"What about Misato?"_ came the reply. Shinji grinned as he typed his answer.  
“美里呢？”回复来了。真嗣一边微笑一边输入答案。

_"That's just Misato being Misato. Why haven't I seen any of the lingerie yet?"_ Shinji could have sworn he heard three female screams after he sent the message off.  
“美里就是美里。为什么我还没看到内衣呢？”真嗣可以发誓，在他发出信息后，他听到了三声女性的尖叫声。

_"You wish! So, have the strippers shown up yet?"_ Asuka sent back. Shinji turned ten shades of red as he looked around, watching everyone else having a good time. He nervously looked at Kaji, who turned and gave him a wink and a satisfied grin. Shinji felt his heart sink, knowing full well that his best man would not be happy until he had thoroughly embarrassed him before the night was over.  
“你愿意！那么，脱衣舞娘们出现了吗？”飞鸟送了回来。真嗣的脸色涨红了十度，环顾四周，看着其他人都玩得很开心。他紧张地看着卡吉，卡吉转过身来，对他眨了眨眼，露出满意的笑容。真嗣的心沉了下去，他很清楚，除非他在今晚结束之前让他彻底难堪，否则他的伴郎不会高兴。

_"I don't think Kaji hired any strippers. I asked him not to do anything like that,"_ he typed, hoping that his best man did as he asked, but knowing beyond a shadow of a doubt that his wishes were about to be unfulfilled.  
“我不认为加持雇佣了任何脱衣舞娘。我要求他不要做那样的事情，”他打字道，希望他的伴郎按照他的要求去做，但毫无疑问地知道他的愿望即将实现。未实现的。

_"We're talking about Kaji here. Knowing him and your pervy friends, you'll have a whole army of strippers."_ Shinji couldn't tell if it was the wine he had been drinking or what Asuka had sent in her message that had him trembling slightly.  
“我们在这里谈论的是加持。了解了他和你的变态朋友，你就会拥有一整支脱衣舞娘大军。”真嗣不知道是自己喝了酒，还是明日香发来的信息让他微微颤抖。

"Hey Shinji!" Kaji called out, "Get your ass back up here! The best part is about to start!" Kaji's shark grin made Shinji moan in defeat.  
“喂，慎二！”加治喊道：“给我滚回来！最精彩的部分就要开始了！​​”加持的鲨鱼般的笑容让真嗣发出失败的呻吟声。

_"Gotta go, hon. Love you!"_ he quickly typed as he took one last gulp of wine.  
“我得走了，亲爱的。爱你！”他喝完最后一口酒，快速打字。

_"Me too,"_ was the last thing he saw before folding the phone closed and standing up. He slowly made his way back up to the place of 'honor'.  
“我也是。”这是他合上手机并站起来之前看到的最后一句话。他慢慢地回到了‘荣誉’的位置。

"All right, gentlemen! This is the moment you have all been waiting for! Touji! Kensuke! Please bring out the cake!" Kaji announced as he stood back and allowed the two younger men roll out the largest cake Shinji had ever seen.  
“好了，先生们！你们等待已久的时刻到了！东司！健介！请把蛋糕拿出来！”梶宣布，他退后一步，让两个年轻人推出了真嗣见过的最大的蛋糕。

_"Oh god! Not the 'Giant Cake with a Girl inside'! How cliché can you get?"_ Shinji thought as the cake was placed not more than ten feet in front of him.  
“天哪！不是‘里面有女孩的巨型蛋糕’！你能得到什么陈词滥调？”真嗣一边想着，蛋糕就放在他面前不超过十英尺的地方。

"Gentlemen! Music please!" the ringmaster known as Kaji ordered the musicians, causing the sound of dying felines to start up once more. Shinji was ready to eat his service pistol right then and there. Unfortunately, it was at home where he wished to be at this particular moment in time. "Shinji, it is now time to show you everything you are going to miss now that you are soon to leave the Hallowed Halls of Bachelorhood. Ladies, if you please!" Shinji cringed, fearing what was to come, and what Asuka would do to him for even looking at the other ladies. It wouldn't be his fault, but that wouldn't make any difference whatsoever.  
“先生们！请听音乐！”被称为卡吉（Kaji）的马戏团指挥命令音乐家们，导致垂死的猫科动物的声音再次响起。真嗣当时就准备好吃掉他的手枪了。不幸的是，在这个特定的时刻，他希望呆在家里。 “真嗣，现在是时候向你们展示你们将要怀念的一切了，因为你们即将离开单身的神圣殿堂。女士们，如果你们愿意的话！”真嗣畏缩起来，担心接下来会发生什么，也担心明日香会因为他看其他女士而对他做什么。这不是他的错，但这也没有什么区别。

"Hello boys!" a familiar voice rang out, followed quickly by a noise like that of an N2 mine going off, drowning out even the sounds of tortured cats. Whoops, catcalls, and whistles were going off all around Shinji. Opening his eyes ever so slightly, he was utterly stunned by the sight before him, as his jaw hit the ground.  
“嗨，小子们！”一个熟悉的声音响起，紧接着是类似N2地雷爆炸的声音，甚至淹没了猫受折磨的声音。真嗣周围响起了呼喊声、嘘声和口哨声。微微睁开眼睛，他被眼前的景象惊呆了，下巴都快撞到了地上。

Three beautiful young women were standing from the middle of the cake. Shinji could not believe the sight before him. The first one he saw was Misato, flashing her killer smile, dressed in a top hat, a black sleeveless leotard, a black jacket with tails, a white shirt collar with a black bowtie, white cuffs, black tights and black high heels. Her…_assets_…were on the verge of freeing themselves, much to the hopes and desires of the men present.  
蛋糕中间站着三个美丽的年轻女子。真嗣简直不敢相信眼前的景象。他第一个看到的就是美里，脸上闪着杀手般的笑容，头戴礼帽，身穿黑色无袖紧身衣，黑色马尾夹克，白色衬衫领子，黑色领结，白色袖口，黑色紧身裤，黑色高跟鞋。她的……资产……正处于解放自己的边缘，这很大程度上符合在场男人的希望和愿望。

As she was assisted out the cake, Shinji looked upon the next one. This one shocked him beyond belief. Rei stood there, beaming with pride, a smile on her lips. She wore a white leotard like Misato's black one, except this one was went up to her throat. However, the diamond shaped cutout revealed more cleavage than her brother was comfortable with in a room full of men. Her light blue tights matched her hair perfectly, and, along with the white high heeled pumps, helped to set off her long legs. Shinji was more than willing to gouge out every pair of eyes in the room if they so much as looked at his sister in a lustful way. He was stopped, however, by the sight of the final lady.  
当她被协助拿出蛋糕时，真嗣看着下一个。这让他震惊得难以置信。雷伊站在那里，脸上洋溢着骄傲的笑容，嘴角挂着微笑。她穿着一件白色的紧身衣，就像美里的黑色紧身衣一样，只不过这一件是到了她的喉咙处。然而，菱形切口暴露出的乳沟超出了她哥哥在满是男人的房间里所能接受的程度。浅蓝色的紧身裤和她的头发很相配，搭配白色的高跟鞋，衬托出她的大长腿。真嗣非常愿意把房间里的每一双眼睛都挖出来，只要他们用淫荡的眼神看着他的妹妹。然而，当他看到最后一位女士时，他停了下来。

Asuka stood at the top of the cake, wearing what appeared to be a very skimpy version of her plug suit. It was a red leotard, very open in the chest area, with red and black sleeves. She wore a white shirt collar held close with a green string tie, and the numbers '02' written on it in red. Her hair was tied back like it normally was, but with red ribbons this time instead of her A10 clips. Her coffee colored tights and red open toed pumps completed the outfit perfectly. Her bright blue eyes locked onto Shinji's as he stood and walked forward toward her. Other guys knew better than to approach the pair.  
明日香站在蛋糕的最上面，穿着看起来非常暴露的插头套装。那是一件红色的紧身衣，胸部非常敞开，袖子是红黑相间的。她穿着白色衬衫领子，系着一条绿色领带，领带上用红色写着数字“02”。她的头发像往常一样绑在脑后，但这次用的是红色丝带，而不是 A10 发夹。她的咖啡色紧身裤和红色露趾高跟鞋完美地完成了这套服装。当真嗣站起来朝她走来时，她明亮的蓝眼睛锁定了他。其他人知道最好不要接近这两个人。

He took her gently by the waist and helped her off the cake, placing her ever so softly on the ground. Shinji wanted to take her in his arms so badly at that moment that it hurt, but Asuka had other plans. She gently pushed him backwards toward his chair, as Misato and Rei danced to the music being played by the now shell-shocked members of the band. She sat crosswise in his lap and snuggled up to him while everyone's attentions were turned to the other two ladies.  
他轻轻揽住她的腰，将她从蛋糕上扶下来，轻轻地放在地上。真嗣那一刻非常想把她抱在怀里，疼得都疼，但明日香却另有打算。她轻轻地把他向后推向椅子，美里和丽随着乐队成员演奏的音乐起舞。她横坐在他的腿上，依偎着他，而所有人的注意力都转向了另外两位女士。

"Kaji?" Shinji asked, unable to look anywhere else but into her eyes.  
“加吉？”真嗣问道，只能看着她的眼睛，无法看向其他地方。

"Kaji," she affirmed as she leaned forward and kissed him. "You like?"  
“卡吉，”她一边确认一边向前倾身吻了他。 “你喜欢？”

"I like," he answered her back, taking a brief glance downward before her fingers under his chin brought his eyes back to hers. "Is that some of the lingerie you were telling me about?"  
“我喜欢，”他回答她，向下看了一眼，然后她的手指放在他的下巴上，让他的目光回到了她的身上。 “这就是你跟我说的内衣吗？”

"Yup," she replied as her eyes twinkled, "But nowhere near all of it!"  
“是的，”她眼睛闪闪发亮地回答，“但远不是全部！”

"Really? Are going to model some of it for me tonight?" he asked mischievously, his own blue eyes twinkling. Asuka's eyes narrowed as a smirk crossed her lips.  
“真的吗？今晚要为我做一些模型吗？”他顽皮地问道，他自己的蓝眼睛闪闪发光。明日香的眼睛眯了起来，嘴角浮现出一丝笑意。

"Maybe if you're a good boy, I will," she said as she crossed her legs and snuggled closer to him. Everyone else was ignoring them as Rei and Misato leapt upon the stage and began dancing with the guys in the band.  
“也许，如果你是个好孩子，我会的，”她交叉着双腿，依偎着他说道。当 Rei 和 Misato 跳上舞台并开始与乐队中的成员跳舞时，其他人都忽略了他们。

"But you don't like good boys!"  
“可你不喜欢好男孩！”

"I know," she grinned as she wiggled her eyebrows at him and batted her eyelashes. Shinji burst out in laughter as he and Asuka fell into their own little world while the party continued without them……  
“我知道，”她笑着对他摇动眉毛，眨动睫毛。真嗣大笑起来，他和明日香陷入了自己的小世界，而派对却在没有他们的情况下继续进行……

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Technically Friday, D-day minus one…  
从技术上讲，周五，诺曼底登陆日减一……_

The party finally wound down around one a.m., which was too early for some folks, but seeing how the guest of honor and two of the dancers had school the next day, nobody really complained. Misato and Kaji were sitting next to each other at the table, while Asuka continued to sit in Shinji's lap, the two of them trading small kisses with each other. Rei sat chatting with one young man, before he took her hand and kissed it, saying farewell. Her cheeks were slightly flushed as she looked on as the young man went back to the stage and picked up his gear, leaving for the night.  
派对最终在凌晨一点左右结束，这对一些人来说还太早，但看到主宾和两名舞者第二天上学的样子，没有人真正抱怨。美里和梶在餐桌上并肩而坐，而明日香则继续坐在真嗣的腿上，两人交换着小小的吻。丽坐下来和一位年轻人聊天，然后他握住她的手并亲吻了她，道别。看着年轻人回到舞台，拿起装备准备过夜，她的脸颊微微泛红。

"Got yourself a nice catch, Rei?" Misato asked, getting ready to launch into full blown teasing mode. Shinji looked over to his sister and saw her blush. He had never seen her look so happy as she did at that moment.  
“你钓到了不错的鱼吗，丽？”美里问道，准备进入全面的戏弄模式。真嗣看向妹妹，发现她脸红了。他从来没有见过她像这一刻那样高兴。

"I think so, yes," she replied softly, a small smile gracing her lips. "His name is Ichigo, and he is the bass player for the band. He is nice, well-versed in poetry, and has a cute butt." You could have heard a pin drop as everyone assembled sat there in shock over what the usually quiet and reserved girl had just revealed. Shinji wondered if it was time to have a talk to Rei about guys, or if he needed to pay a visit to this Ichigo character.  
“我想是的，是的，”她轻声回答，嘴角挂着一丝微笑。 “他叫一护，是乐队的贝斯手，人很好，精通诗歌，屁股也很可爱。”当每个人都坐在那里，对这个一向沉默寡言的女孩刚刚透露的事情感到震惊时，你可以听到一根针掉在地上的声音。真嗣想知道是不是该和丽谈谈男人的事，或者他是否需要拜访一下这个一护角色。

"I would have thought you would be a drummer girl, Rei," Asuka suddenly spoke up, breaking the silence that had reined momentarily at the pale girl's comments.  
“我以为你会成为一名鼓手女孩，丽。”明日香突然开口说道，打破了因苍白女孩的评论而暂时陷入的沉默。

"No, he was not very cute and had bad breath, Besides, he kept staring at my chest the whole time we talked. He must think I have brown eyes." Kaji promptly spit out the mouthful of soda he had just taken as Shinji started to have a violent coughing fit. Asuka patted him hard on the back while Misato wiped the soda that had managed to land on her arm when Kaji did his best impersonation of a shaken up beer can. Rei reached for her purse and started pulling little pieces of paper from various places in her costume and putting them inside. Everyone looked at her strangely, wanting some sort of explanation.  
“不，他长得不太可爱，而且有口臭。而且，我们说话的时候，他一直盯着我的胸口看。他一定以为我有棕色的眼睛。”当真嗣开始剧烈咳嗽时，梶立即吐出了刚刚喝下的一口苏打水。明日香用力拍了拍他的背，而美里则擦拭着加持尽力模仿摇晃的啤酒罐时落在她手臂上的苏打水。丽伸手去拿她的钱包，开始从她服装的各个地方拉出小纸片并将它们放进去。所有人都用异样的目光看着她，想要得到一个解释。

"I cannot believe so many men wanted me to have their phone numbers tonight. What am I supposed to do with these?" she asked, her crimson eyes begging for instructions. Shinji's eyes bugged out and began to look like he was going to hunt down each and every guy who talked to his sister.  
“我不敢相信今晚有这么多男人想要我知道他们的电话号码。我该怎么处理这些呢？”她问道，猩红的眼睛寻求指示。真嗣的眼睛瞪得大大的，看起来他要追捕每一个和他妹妹说话的人。

"Come on girls, let's get these two babies home before they have a stroke," Misato said as she took Kaji's hand and lead him from the table toward the front door. "The clean up crew can take care of all of this. Are all Shinji's things in the car?"  
“来吧，女孩们，我们要在这两个孩子中风之前把他们送回家，”美里一边说，一边拉着加持的手，把他从桌子上引向前门。 “这一切清理人员都可以处理。真嗣的东西都在车里吗？”

"Yes, I made sure of it," Kaji replied as he handed the keys to Shinji's car to Misato. Shinji looked at him quizzically. "Sorry, kiddo, you've had wine to drink. You're not driving."  
“是的，我确定了。”梶回答道，他把真嗣的车钥匙交给了美里。慎二疑惑地看着他。 “抱歉，小子，你喝了酒，你不开车了。”

"Okay, I understand that, but who's going to drive you home?" Shinji asked while his lady slid from his lap and took his hand. Kaji just smiled.  
“好吧，我明白了，但是谁送你回家呢？”真嗣问道，而他的夫人从他腿上滑下来，握住了他的手。梶只是微笑。

"Gonna drive myself, Mr. Ikari," he replied as Shinji gave him a dirty look. "What? The only thing I've had to drink all evening is club soda. I never touched a drop of alcohol." They all looked at him incredulously as he chuckled and lead the group toward the door. "Does everyone have their clothes….."  
“我要自己开车，碇先生。”他回答道，真嗣恶狠狠地看了他一眼。 “什么？我整个晚上唯一喝的就是苏打水。我从来没有碰过一滴酒。”所有人都难以置信地看着他，他轻笑一声，带着大家朝门口走去。 “大家都有衣服了吗……”

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the darkened far corner of the club, a lone occupant watched the scene unfold before him. He was troubled at the thought of so many members of NERV wanting to spend time with Rei. He did, however, look on with pride at seeing his son's accomplishments being shown to the crowd. It was a strange feeling for him, as he and the Third Child had never bonded in any way whatsoever. He began to like the feeling.  
在俱乐部阴暗的角落里，一个孤独的人注视着眼前的场景。想到有这么多 NERV 成员想要和丽共度时光，他感到很困扰。然而，当他看到儿子的成就向观众展示时，他确实感到自豪。这对他来说是一种奇怪的感觉，因为他和第三个孩子从来没有以任何方式建立过联系。他开始喜欢这种感觉。

"Well, Commander, did you enjoy the party?" Fuyutsuki asked as he slid out from the shadows to stand next to his superior. Ikari turned and looked at Fuyutsuki, his eyes unreadable behind his tinted glasses, but with one eyebrow cocked upward.  
“怎么样，指挥官，这次聚会玩得开心吗？”冬月从阴影中溜出来，站在上司身边问道。碇转过身来看着冬月，他的眼睛在有色眼镜后面难以辨认，但一根眉毛向上翘起。

"Such activities are irrelevant, sensei," the elder Ikari replied, his stone mask falling once more into place. "I merely attended to ensure that nothing happened to any of the pilots. There are still issues that have yet to be resolved involving the Second Child. It would have been foolish to allow such a gathering to go on unsupervised."  
“这样的活动是无关紧要的，老师，”碇长老回答道，他的石制面具再次落回原位。 “我参加只是为了确保任何飞行员没有发生任何事情。还有涉及第二个孩子的问题尚未解决。让这样的聚会在无人监督的情况下进行是愚蠢的。”

"Ah. So it had nothing to do with your only child getting married Saturday?" Fuyutsuki queried, knowing the true answer, but also knowing what answer his old student would give him.  
“啊。所以这和你唯一的孩子周六结婚没有关系？”冬月问道，他知道真正的答案，但也知道他的老学生会给他什么样的答案。

"None whatsoever. The First and Second Children placed themselves in a precarious position doing what they did this evening. The baby within Pilot Soryu could have been injured had she fallen, or if the perpetrator tried to make contact with her again. He could have struck at the First Child as he did the Second." A small growl started deep within Ikari's throat, but he caught it and suppressed it in time.  
“无论如何都没有。第一和第二个孩子在今晚所做的事情中将自己置于危险的境地。如果飞行员 Soryu 跌倒，或者如果肇事者试图再次与她接触，她体内的婴儿可能会受伤。他可能会像对待第二个孩子一样袭击第一个孩子。”碇喉咙深处发出一声轻微的咆哮，但他及时抓住并压制住了。

"I see. Sound logic, Commander," Fuyutsuki answered back, getting a nod from the elder Ikari.  
“原来如此。指挥官，逻辑合理。”冬月回答道，碇长老点了点头。

"I want the name of every man that spoke to Rei this evening and a complete background search completed as soon as possible. I especially want a thorough history of the bass player for the band," he said as he stood to leave, making sure that everyone else but the clean up crew had departed before he did.  
“我想要今晚与 Rei 交谈过的每个人的名字，并尽快完成完整的背景调查。我特别想要乐队贝斯手的完整历史，”他在起身离开时说道，确保除了清理人员之外，其他人都在他之前离开了。

"I understand, sir," the older man replied, mentally making a checklist of things that needed to begin first thing in the morning.  
“我明白，先生，”年长的男人回答道，心里列了一张早上第一件事需要做的事情清单。

"And Fuyutsuki? Procure me a copy of the band's CD. I need it for…research purposes," Ikari called back over his shoulder as he left through a side door. Fuyutsuki's eyes shot up, but turned to do his commander's bidding.  
“冬月呢？给我买一张乐队的 CD。我需要它用于……研究目的，”碇从侧门离开时回头喊道。冬月的眼睛猛地睁开，但转而执行指挥官的命令。

### Chapter 7
_Friday Evening, D-Day minus one…  
星期五晚上，D 日前一天…_

"Are you sure he's really a minister, Shinji?" Asuka asked as she opened the door to their apartment, and was quickly followed in by the rest of the clan. Shinji just shook his head.  
“你确定他真的是一位牧师吗，真嗣？”明日香打开了他们公寓的门，其他人迅速跟进。真嗣只是摇了摇头。

"Yes, I'm sure," he replied as he followed her into the living room. "Besides, you're the one who chose him. I thought you knew all about him!"  
“是的，我确定，”他跟在她后面走进客厅。“而且，选他的是你。我以为你对他了解得很清楚！”

"Well, I went with Hikari's suggestion. He's the one that handled her oldest sister's wedding. If I had known he was so, well…"  
"嗯，我听了光的建议。他是处理她姐姐的婚礼的人。如果我早知道他是这样的，嗯…"

"Laid back?" Shinji offered with a smile as he took a seat. Asuka looked at him for a second, her face contorted as she searched for the proper wording and failed.  
"随和的？" 真嗣微笑着说，坐下来。明日香看着他，脸上扭曲着表情，她努力寻找合适的措辞，但失败了。"

"Well, that too. It's just, I don't know! He's not like any minister I've ever met! I mean, just look at him! He's a freaking giant!" the redhead remarked, confusion plain on her face.  
"嗯，也是。只是，我不知道！他不像我见过的任何牧师！我是说，看看他！他简直就是个巨人！" 红发女孩说道，脸上满是困惑。"

"Come on, Asuka," Misato piped up as she walked in the room, followed closely by Kaji and Heidi, "Do you really think that we would allow anyone to perform the ceremony who wasn't NERV approved? You shouldn't judge people by their appearance!"  
“阿斯卡，别这样，”米莎托一边走进房间，凯吉和海蒂紧随其后，一边说道，“你真的认为我们会允许任何未经 NERV 批准的人主持仪式吗？你不应该以貌取人！”

"Besides, he's a really great guy!," Heidi added as she took a seat on the sofa and crossed her legs, a small smile on her face. "He's funny, sweet, fun to be with, laughs easily, smiles all the time, has a really cute…"  
“而且，他真的是个很棒的人！”海蒂坐在沙发上，交叉双腿，脸上带着微笑说道。“他很幽默，很甜蜜，相处起来很有趣，笑声悦耳，总是面带微笑，还有一个非常可爱的…”

"Aunt Heidi!" Asuka spun on her heel and confronted her aunt, her hands on her hips and a scowl on her face. "You sitting next to him and flirting with him during the entire dinner didn't help much! What do we really know about this guy? He looks like a cross between Santa Claus and a Viking!" Heidi's eyes merely twinkled as she watched her niece's distress.  
“海蒂阿姨！”阿斯卡转身面对她的阿姨，双手叉腰，脸上挂着怒容。“你整个晚餐都坐在他旁边跟他调情，这一点一点也没帮助！我们到底了解这个家伙多少？他看起来像圣诞老人和维京人的混合体！”海蒂的眼睛闪烁着看着侄女的烦恼。

"Asuka, calm down!" Shinji said then quickly regretted it as she spun back toward him and pointed a finger in his direction.  
“明日香，冷静点！”新吉说完立刻后悔了，因为她又转身朝他走来，指着他。

"I'm NOT going to calm down, by God! This is our wedding we're talking about!" Asuka screeched, the fire in her eyes very evident. "He looks like he walked off the set of _Braveheart_! So help me, if he walks in tomorrow with a kilt and a claymore, somebody's going to die!" Shinji stood up and put his arms around the upset German, doing his best to comfort her. "I just want to be sure! I don't want anything to go wrong! What do we know about him?"  
“我才不会冷静下来，天哪！我们在讨论的是我们的婚礼！”明日香尖叫道，眼中的火焰显而易见。“他看起来就像是从《勇敢的心》的片场走出来的！我发誓，如果他明天穿着苏格兰裙和大刀进来，一定会有人死！”新吉站起来，抱住这位心烦意乱的德国人，尽力安慰她。“我只是想确认一下！我不想出任何差错！我们对他了解多少？”

"Well, let's see," Kaji said, sitting back as Misato gave him a nod of approval. "Reverend Derrick K. Knight. Born on August 2, 1975. Citizen of the United States. Ordained in 1998 and moved to Japan soon after. Barely avoided death when Tokyo was bombed in 2000, and worked to help the refugees and survivors. Chosen by NERV as an official Chaplain in 2010 and moved to Tokyo-3. Officiated more weddings and funerals than I can count."  
“嗯，让我们看看，”加持坐回去，看到美里点头表示赞同。“德里克·K·奈特牧师。1975 年 8 月 2 日出生。美国公民。1998 年晋升神职，不久后搬到日本。2000 年东京遭受轰炸时险些丧命，后来致力于帮助难民和幸存者。2010 年被 NERV 选为官方牧师，搬到第三新东京。主持的婚礼和葬礼比我数得过来的还多。”

"Six foot five inches, two hundred and ninety-five pounds, long wavy brown hair, green eyes, full beard, nice smile, single, cute…" Heidi continued, her eyes clouded.  
“身高六英尺五英寸，体重两百九十五磅，长长的褐色波浪发，绿色眼睛，浓密胡须，笑容甜美，单身，可爱…” 海蒂继续说着，眼中带着阴霾。

"Heidi!" Shinji said as he felt the girl in his arms start to tense up again. "You're not helping!" She gave Shinji an apologetic look.  
“海蒂！”新吉感觉怀里的女孩再次紧张起来。“你没帮上忙！”她向新吉道歉的眼神。

"What's the deal with the long hair anyway? With braids at his temples? What kind of minister is he? Don't they all wear their hair short or something?" Asuka said as she looked up from Shinji's chest.  
“那头长发是怎么回事？太阳穴还编着辫子？他是什么牧师？他们不都留短发之类的吗？”明日香抬起头，从新吉的胸口看向天花板。

"He is different, I'll give you that," Shinji agreed as he looked at his lady, " but he seemed like a good guy when he counseled us after the rehearsal."  
“他确实与众不同，我承认，”新吉边看着她说，“但排练结束后，他给我们提建议时，感觉他是个好人。”

"I know, I know," Asuka said, still trembling a bit as she looked around the room. "Say, anyone seen Rei? I kinda wanted to go over last minute details, just to make sure we haven't forgotten anything."  
“我知道，我知道，”明日香说着，仍有些颤抖，环顾四周。“话说，有人看到惠儿了吗？我想最后检查一下细节，确保我们没有漏掉什么。”

"She told me that she had some sort of obligation to take care of before the night was over," Shinji replied, "She didn't seem to be looking forward to it. I hope there's nothing wrong." Asuka looked puzzled for a second before nodding her head in understanding.  
“她告诉我她有些事情要在晚上结束前处理，”新吉回答道，“她似乎并不期待。希望没有什么问题。”明日香一时感到困惑，然后点头表示理解。

"Don't worry, your sister can take care of herself. She'll be okay," Asuka reassured him as she freed herself from his embrace and sprawled out on the couch. "Sheesh! What a day! I can't wait to get to bed tonight!" She winked at Shinji who smiled and then quickly covered it up.  
“别担心，你妹妹能照顾好自己。她会没事的。”明日香从他的怀抱中挣脱出来，懒散地躺在沙发上。“唉！今天怎么这么累！我等不及今晚上床睡觉了！”她对着真嗣眨了眨眼，真嗣笑了笑，然后赶紧掩饰起来。

"Just think, Shinji! It's your last night as a free man!" Kaji teased as Misato handed him a soda and sat back down beside him. She playfully slapped his leg as she joined in on the teasing.  
“想想看，真嗣！这是你最后一晚作为自由人！”加持拿着一罐苏打递给他，坐到他身边，调皮地拍了拍他的腿，加入了取笑的行列。

"Yeah! Enjoy it while you can! It's your last night to sleep alone, unless you manage to royally piss off your wife sometime in the future," Misato added, her eyes twinkling dangerously. "This may be our last chance to get it together!" Asuka and Shinji sat there, dumbfounded.  
“是啊！尽情享受吧！这是你最后一晚独自睡觉，除非你将来惹怒了你的妻子。”美里补充道，眼睛里闪烁着危险的光芒。“也许这是我们最后一次机会！”明日香和真嗣坐在那里，目瞪口呆。

"WHAT?!" the two teenagers screamed in unison, eyes bulging and jaws dropped. Misato, Kaji, and Heidi chuckled at the reaction. "JUST WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?!"  
“什么？！”两个少年异口同声尖叫，眼睛瞪大，下巴掉了下来。美里、加持和海蒂对这个反应笑了起来。“你到底是什么意思？！”

"Geeze! It was just a joke!" Misato replied as she wiggled a finger in her ear, trying to get the ringing to stop. "You know I'd never do anything with Shinji!"  
“天啊！只是个玩笑！”美里回答道，一边摇动耳朵里的手指，试图止住耳鸣。“你知道我绝对不会和真司做什么！”

"That's not it, you moron! What do you mean it's Shinji's last night to sleep alone?" Asuka spat out, jumping to her feet with her hands on her hips.  
“你这个白痴！不是这个意思！你到底是什么意思说真司今晚是最后一个独自睡觉的晚上？”明日香怒气冲冲地站起身，双手叉腰。

"Misato, you know we've been sharing the same bed for a while now," Shinji added slowly, like he was trying to explain something difficult to a small child. "You haven't had a problem with it so far."  
“美里，你知道我们已经一起睡在同一张床上一段时间了，” 真嗣慢慢地补充道，就像是在试图向一个小孩解释一件困难的事情。“到目前为止，你还没有问题。”

"It's not that, Shinji," Heidi stepped in before all hell could break loose, as in Asuka starting to kick Misato's shapely rear, "It supposed to be bad luck for the groom to see the bride on their wedding day BEFORE the wedding. That's exactly what would happen when you two wake up in the morning. Sorry, it's tradition." Asuka and Shinji were not happy, that much could be seen. They hadn't slept without each other since this whole situation started.  
"“不是这样的，真嗣，” 海蒂在一切失控之前插话道，比如明日香开始踢美里那修长的屁股，“新郎在婚礼当天之前见到新娘会招来厄运。当你们早上醒来时，这正是会发生的事情。抱歉，这是传统。”明日香和真嗣都不高兴，这一点是显而易见的。自从这整个情况开始以来，他们就没有分开过睡觉。”

"Uh, so, Shinji! Did you have any problems getting out of school this morning?" Misato asked, trying to switch gears and get everyone to relax. Shinji shook his head and smiled a tad.  
“嗯，那么，真嗣！你今天早上上学有遇到什么问题吗？” 美里问道，试图转换话题让大家放松。真嗣摇了摇头，微笑了一点。

"No problems, but you should have seen the teacher's face when a quarter of his class got up and left before lunch. I still don't think he understands that Asuka and I are getting married. His expression at seeing that we were going to be out for a week was…_interesting_…to say the least." Shinji said as he remembered the confused look on the elderly teacher's face.  
“没问题，但你应该看到老师在午饭前有四分之一的学生起身离开时的表情。我仍然觉得他不明白明日香和我要结婚的事。看到我们要离开一周时，他的表情……可以说是有趣的……”新吉回忆起那位老师困惑的表情时说道。

"I don't think he understood the paperwork that Shinji gave him, except the excuses to leave early," Asuka added, disgust clear on her face. "There's no telling what's going to happen when we come back from Okinawa!"  
“我觉得他根本没理解新吉给他的文件，除了提前离开的借口。”明日香说着，脸上带着明显的厌恶之色。“我们从冲绳回来后会发生什么事情，真是难以预料！”

"Speaking of which, what do you to plan on doing there for a week? I guess diving's out of the question with the baby and all, and seeing how Shinji can't swim. Anything else planned?" Misato asked. Asuka smirked, which caused Misato to blush. Shinji noticed this and blushed as well.  
“说到这个，你们在那边一周打算做什么？我猜潜水对于有宝宝的你们来说不太现实，再加上新吉不会游泳。还有其他计划吗？”美里问道。明日香咧嘴一笑，让美里脸红了。新吉也注意到了这一点，脸也红了起来。

"Stop it, you pervert! Who says Shinji can't swim?" Asuka replied, "I taught him in a weak moment last summer!" Misato's jaw dropped while Heidi and Kaji just snickered. Misato turned to the other two adults in the room.  
“住手，你这个色狼！谁说新吉不会游泳？”明日香回答道，“我在去年夏天的一个脆弱时刻教过他！”美里的下巴都快掉下来了，而海蒂和加持只是窃笑。美里转向房间里的另外两位成年人。

"What? You knew?" Misato growled at Kaji, who began to laugh heartily.  
“什么？你知道？”美里对加持咆哮道，而加持开始开心地大笑起来。

"Yeah, I saw them in the NERV pool one day. I must say, Shinji's a better man than I am! If you were wearing the same outfit Asuka was, I would never be able to concentrate on the lessons and I would have drowned!" Kaji laughed before receiving a pillow to his face from a fuming redhead.  
“是的，有一天我在 NERV 的泳池看到了他们。我必须说，新吉比我更出色！如果你穿和明日香一样的衣服，我绝对无法集中精力上课，我可能会淹死！”加持笑着说完，然后被一个愤怒的红发女郎扔了个枕头。

"You should laugh, Kaji! That's the same outfit you helped me buy!" Asuka said as she crossed her arms.  
"“加持，你应该笑一笑！这套衣服就是你帮我挑的！”明日香说着，双臂交叉。

"I know!" Kaji continued to laugh, "but you definitely grew into it, and almost out of it! Are you sure you weren't trying to give Shinji a free show?" Asuka turned her head and huffed. She wasn't about to let them all know that was exactly what she was trying to do. Like she said, it was a moment of weakness.  
"“我知道！”加持继续笑着，“但你确实长大了，几乎穿不下了！你确定你不是想给新吉看个免费秀吗？”明日香扭过头嗤之以鼻。她可不打算让他们都知道她当时确实是这么想的。就像她说的，那只是一时的软弱。

The night wound down, as Kaji took his leave and Heidi and Misato retreated to their rooms. Shinji went to the linen closet and pulled out a spare pillow and blankets and made the sofa up for his lonely night of sleep. He sat down at one end of the sofa as the door to his and Asuka's room slid open, revealing a vision in red.  
夜晚渐渐平静下来，加持告辞，海蒂和美里也各自回到自己的房间。新吉去亚斯卡和他的房间的衣柜里拿出一条备用枕头和毯子，为自己一个人的孤独夜晚准备睡觉。他坐在沙发的一端，就在这时，亚斯卡和他们的房间的门滑开，一个身穿红衣的身影映入眼帘。

Asuka was wearing one of the more modest pieces of lingerie that she had received from Misato at the shower. It was a red satin nightgown that just barely covered Asuka's rear-end. Shinji had to pick his jaw back up and put his eyes back in his head as his Red-Headed Goddess walked slowly up to him, a smile crossing her lips as she curled up in his lap and gave him a deep, soul-searing kiss.  
明日香穿着米莎托在派对上送给她的较为保守的内衣之一。那是一件红色的缎面睡袍，勉强遮住了明日香的臀部。看着火红的女神缓缓走向他，新吉不得不把下巴抬起，把眼睛从地上捡起来，她微笑着蜷缩在他腿上，深情地吻了他一下。

"I can so get used to this," Shinji said as he gave her a kiss in return. The two sat there and merely snuggled and held onto one another for a while before Asuka turned to him and looked deep into his steel blue eyes as he ran his hand over her silky thigh.  
“我可以习惯这种感觉的，”新吉说着，回吻了她。两人坐在那里，互相依偎着，一段时间后，明日香转过身来，深深地凝视着他那钢蓝色的眼睛，他的手在她丝滑的大腿上轻抚着。

"Shinji, have you thought about what we're going to do on our honeymoon?" she asked, knowing by his responses that he did, but she felt the hesitation in his heart.  
“新吉，你有没有想过我们蜜月要做些什么？”她问道，知道从他的回答中他已经考虑过，但她感受到了他心中的犹豫。

"I have," he began as he lost himself in her eyes, fearing what he would see, but seeing nothing but love.  
“我有，”他开始说，当他沉浸在她的眼中，害怕会看到什么，但却只看到了爱意。

"Do you want to…uh...what I mean is…do you…desire…uh..._Ach Gott_!" Asuka stammered, feeling extremely embarrassed. Shinji placed a finger on her lips. His hands were trembling, almost as much as she was.  
“你想要……呃……我的意思是……你……渴望……呃……天啊！”明日香结结巴巴地说着，感到非常尴尬。新吉把手指放在她的嘴唇上。他的手在颤抖，几乎和她一样。

"I want to make love to you so badly it hurts," Shinji told her in a calm, clear voice, "As certain parts of my anatomy can attest to!" He and Asuka both started grinning and giggling like fools, before Shinji became somber once more.  
“我非常想和你做爱，简直痛苦至极，”新吉用平静而清晰的声音告诉她，“正如我身体某些部位所证明的！”他和明日香都开始傻乎傻笑，然后新吉再次变得严肃起来。

"The only thing I'm worried about is right here," he said as he placed his hand on her belly, causing warm feelings to spread throughout her being. "I don't know if having…_relations_…will hurt her or you." Asuka saw the deep caring and love in his eyes as he showed his genuine concern for her and their child. "If I have to wait until she's born, and you're feeling better for me to make love to my wife, then that's what I'll do."  
“我唯一担心的就是这里。”他说着，一只手放在她的肚子上，温暖的感觉在她体内蔓延。“我不知道……发生关系……会不会伤害到她或者你。”明日香看到他眼中深深的关怀和爱意，他真诚地关心着她和他们的孩子。“如果我必须等到她出生，等到你感觉好些，我才能和我的妻子做爱，那我就会这样做。”

"I love you, Shinji Ikari," Asuka replied as she snuggled closer to him, sharing his warmth.  
“碇真嗣，我爱你。”明日香回答道，她依偎在他身边，分享着他的温暖。

"I love you too, hon," he said as he held her tighter, afraid to let her go, fearing he was in a dream that would vanish in the morning sun. He didn't want this night to end.  
“我也爱你，亲爱的。”他说着，紧紧地拥抱着她，害怕放手，害怕这是一个只会在早晨阳光中消失的梦。他不想让这个夜晚结束。

"Well, I talked to my doctor the last time I went in for a prenatal checkup," Asuka finally spoke up, " and I was going to save this as a surprise for tomorrow, but I'm going to spoil it and tell you anyway! He said, as long as we're careful, there should be no problem with us having _relations_, as you so elegantly put it." She turned to him with a grin larger than Unit One's. He looked extremely happy, but nervous at the same time.  
“嗯，上次我去产检时和医生谈过，”明日香终于开口说道，“本来我打算留到明天给你个惊喜，但我还是忍不住要提前告诉你！他说，只要我们小心，我们之间有关系应该不会有问题，就像你所优雅地表达的那样。” 她转向他，笑容比 EVA 单位一还要灿烂。他看起来非常开心，但同时也很紧张。

"I've…uh…never…well, you know," Shinji stammered, as The Coward snuck up and gave The Man a sucker punch from behind before running for the hills with his eternal adversary right on his heels. Shinji blushed.  
“我…嗯…从来没有…嗯，你知道的，”新吉结结巴巴地说道，懦夫从背后偷袭了男人，然后拔腿就跑，他永恒的对手紧追不舍。新吉脸红了。

"Shhh, I know. I wish I could say the same," Asuka replied as the light in her eyes dimmed just a fraction, "but seeing how I don't remember a damn thing, I think we're both in the same boat! Did Dr. Akagi talk to you about it?"  
“嘘，我知道。我也希望我能说同样的话，”明日香回答道，眼中的光芒微微黯淡了一点，“但看到我什么都不记得，我觉得我们俩都处在同一条船上！阿凯博士和你谈过这件事吗？”

"She tried," Shinji began as his blush got even deeper, "but she didn't seem very comfortable around me for some reason. Misato talked to me later about it, and so did Kaji. I never thought I would see either of those two blush about anything!" Asuka giggled.  
“她尝试过，”新吉开始说，脸红得更厉害了，“但她似乎对我并不太舒服。米莎托后来和我谈过这件事，卡琪也是。我从未想过会看到他们两个为任何事情脸红！”明日香咯咯笑了起来。

"I think it's because they think of us as their children, not just as pilots! Can you imagine what it's going to be like to give our children that talk?" Asuka saw his face brighten at the thought of their future children, then darkened just a bit.  
“我觉得是因为他们把我们当作他们的孩子，而不仅仅是飞行员！你能想象给我们的孩子讲这个话题会是什么感觉吗？”明日香看到他脸上因为未来孩子的想法而明亮起来，然后又微微沉重了一些。

"I feel sorry for the first guy our daughter brings home to meet us! I don't know if I'd be sitting their sharpening a sword or if I'd take him to work and show him what kind of toy I drive!" Shinji replied as his lady began to laugh even harder, tears pouring down her face. He looked at her, smirking.  
“我为我们的女儿带回家的第一个男孩感到抱歉！我不知道我会坐在那里磨剑，还是带他去工作，向他展示我开的是什么样的玩具！”新吉回答道，他的女士开始更大声地笑，泪水流过脸颊。他看着她，咧嘴笑着。

"What?" she asked, puzzled by the knowing look on his face.  
“什么？”她问道，对他脸上那种了然的表情感到困惑。

"Just keep laughing, lady! I'd hate to see what you would do to any girl our sons may bring home!" Shinji began to laugh as her face darkened somewhat, thinking about the future.  
“继续笑吧，小姐！我可不想看到我们儿子带回家的女孩会遭遇什么！” 看着她脸色有些阴沉，心里想着未来，真嗣开始笑了起来。

"I'd probably tape her to the front of Unit 2 and take her for a joy ride! If she could handle that, then maybe she would be worthy to date my son!" Asuka growled as Shinji continued to laugh, holding her tighter. The growl stopped and the purring began as Shinji began to nuzzle her neck.  
“我可能会把她绑在 2 号机的前面，然后带她去兜风！如果她能承受得了，也许她就配得上和我儿子约会！” 当真嗣继续笑着紧紧抱住她时，明日香咆哮着。咆哮停下了，开始了咕噜声，真嗣开始在她脖子上蹭来蹭去。

"Do you have any idea how good you make me feel? Especially when you do that?" she asked as she melted further into his arms.  
“你知道你让我感觉有多好吗？尤其是当你这样做的时候？”她问道，她更加融入他的怀抱。

"I have a pretty good idea!" he replied as he continued to stroke her thigh, then worked his way up and patted her rump. "Probably about as good as you make me feel when you nibble on my neck. By the way, if you must give hickies, either make them a little lower or a little smaller! I had a hell of a time today explaining things to the teacher today when he saw it! I had to tell him I got it during training!"  
“我有个相当好的想法！”他回答道，一边继续抚摸她的大腿，然后往上摸了摸她的屁股。“大概和你咬我的脖子时让我感觉一样好吧。顺便说一句，如果你非要留吻痕，要么放低一点，要么小一点！今天老师看到后，我可费了好大劲解释！我只能告诉他是训练时弄的！”

"Oops!" she exclaimed as she looked at her handiwork that was displayed on his neck for the entire world to see. "I never heard you complain before!" she giggled as he continued to knead her butt. "Naughty!"  
“哎呀！”她惊呼道，看着她留在他脖子上供全世界看的杰作。“以前从没听你抱怨过！”她笑着说，他继续揉捏她的屁股。“淘气！”

"Sure am!" Shinji wiggled his eyebrows as the two young people leaned toward each other, their lips gently brushing together, then locking into a deeper kiss.  
“当然！”新吉眨了眨眼睛，两个年轻人靠近彼此，他们的嘴唇轻轻碰在一起，然后深深地吻在一起。

After another half hour or so of kissing and cuddling, Asuka made her way to their room for the night, leaving a very frustrated, lonely and frightened Shinji to sleep on the sofa. It took him a very long time to wind down enough so that sleep could descend upon him. His thoughts were on the lovely lady that slept alone in their room. He wondered if she was as miserable and lonely as he was, but he hoped that she wasn't. He never wished any sort of misery on her whatsoever. His answer came right around 2 a.m. when he felt someone shaking his shoulder.  
再经过大约半个小时的亲吻和依偎，明日香走向他们的房间过夜，留下一个非常沮丧、孤独和害怕的新吉在沙发上睡觉。他花了很长时间才平静下来，让睡意降临。他的思绪都在那位独自在房间里睡觉的可爱女士身上。他想知道她是否和他一样痛苦和孤独，但他希望她不是。答案在凌晨 2 点左右出现，当他感到有人在摇晃他的肩膀时。

"Baby?" Asuka said in a small and quiet voice. "I can't sleep. I don't give a damn about tradition and bad luck! We need you in bed with us, please?" He could feel her trembling as she continued to shake him awake. Shinji quietly sat up and pulled her down into his lap, holding her tightly. After sprinkling her head with light kisses, he felt the trembling cease. Standing up and scooping her into his arms, which caused her to gasp in surprise, he carried her to their room, laid her in their bed and closed the door to the world.  
“宝贝？”明日香小声说道。“我睡不着。我才不在乎传统和厄运呢！我们需要你和我们一起睡，拜托？”他感觉到她在继续摇晃他时在颤抖。新吉安静地坐起来，把她拉到自己的腿上，紧紧地拥抱着她。在轻轻亲吻她的头后，他感觉到颤抖停止了。站起来，把她抱在怀里，这让她惊讶地喘了口气，他把她抱到他们的房间，把她放在床上，然后关上了与世隔绝的门。

_Saturday, D-Day (here we go!)…  
星期六，D-Day（开始了！）…_

"Damn, Kensuke! What the hell is wrong with you? You look worse than Dead-Man-Walking here!" Touji asked as he stuck a finger down his collar in a vain attempt to keep from feeling like he was being hanged. He pointed a thumb over to Shinji, who was doing everything he could to keep calm, cool, and collected. It helped that The Man had The Coward bound in chains and dangling over the edge of a cliff. The nervous energy playing through his system, however, kept making him want to jump around on the balls of his feet and bounce off the walls like Daffy Duck. The mental image of that brought a small smile to Shinji's face.  
“该死，健介！你到底怎么了？你看起来比行刑囚还糟糕！”刚巧托吉一边伸手指进领口，试图不让自己感觉像是被绞死，一边问道。他用拇指指向新吉，新吉正在尽一切努力保持冷静和镇定。幸好那个人把那个懦夫用锁链绑住，悬在悬崖边上。然而，他体内的紧张能量让他想要在脚尖上跳来跳去，像唐老鸭一样在墙上弹跳。想到这个画面让新吉脸上露出微笑。

"You wouldn't believe it, Touji," Kensuke replied as he slowly slipped his tuxedo jacket on and slowly rotated his right arm at the shoulder. He winced and tried to work it in the opposite direction with the same results.  
“你不会相信的，刀二。”肯助慢慢穿上他的礼服外套，缓慢地转动右臂肩膀。他扭曲着脸尝试朝相反方向移动，结果却一样痛苦。

"Try me," his friend answered, causing Kensuke to look around for a second, like he was trying to come up with an answer.  
“试试看。”他的朋友回答道，导致肯助环顾四周一秒，好像在努力寻找答案。

"Uh, let's just say that when the sales people tell you a stun gun shoots one hundred thousand volts, it's best to believe them!" the sandy-haired otaku said as he stood still for Kaji to help him with his bowtie. Shinji and Touji looked at him incredulously.  
“嗯，我们就说当销售人员告诉你一支电击枪能发射十万伏特时，最好相信他们！”这位金发宅男说着，站在那里让加持帮他系领结。新吉和刀二满脸狐疑地看着他。

"You got hit by a stun gun?" Shinji's jaw dropped as he looked at his young friend. "Did you get jumped by someone? Did you call the law?" Kensuke shook his head violently as he tried to stutter a reply.  
“你被电击枪击中了？”看着年轻的朋友，真司的下巴都快掉下来了。“是不是被人袭击了？你报警了吗？”肯助剧烈摇头，试图结结巴巴地回答。

"N-n-no! It wasn't like that!" Kensuke stammered as he held his hands out, wincing once more. "UH…I left mine in my backpack from the last time I camped out! It…it must have gone off last night when I picked it up and put it in my closet!"  
“不、不、不是那样的！”肯助结结巴巴地说着，同时伸出双手，再次畏缩。“啊，我把我的电击枪留在上次露营时的背包里了！昨晚我拿起来放进壁橱时，它……它可能不小心被触发了！”

"Those things are dangerous, Kensuke!" Kaji admonished, a sly smile on his face. "I ought to know, I've been hit by a few before by some rather…_unfriendly_…characters. A few of them were ladies! You didn't happen to try anything with any girls last night after the dinner, did you?" Kaji raised an eyebrow as he studied the results of his efforts. A perfect bow, as usual. Nobody noticed Rei walking through the door.  
“那些东西很危险，肯助！”卡琪责备道，脸上挂着狡黠的微笑。“我可是深有体会，以前被一些相当……不友好的……人击中过几次。其中有几个是女士！你昨晚晚饭后有没有对任何女孩动手动脚？”卡琪挑起一边眉毛，审视着他的成果。一如既往，完美无瑕。没人注意到丽走进门。

"NO! No! N-n-nothing like that!" the sandy-haired lad answered as Rei passed behind him on her way to her brother.  
“不是！不是！不、不是那样！”沙发头发的小伙子回答道，当丽经过他时，他正走向她的哥哥。

"Bzzt!" Rei said softly as she passed, causing Kensuke to jump three feet in the air and whirl around, wide-eyed and sweating. Rei merely kept walking and stood before her brother, who's eyes bulged as he saw how gorgeous his sister looked. The dress was light blue, and almost identical to the one that Asuka had chosen for herself. That and the light hint of makeup that she wore drove Shinji to worry.  
“嗡！”丽轻声说着经过，导致肯努克惊得跳起来，转身看着她，眼睛瞪大，满头大汗。丽只是继续走着，站在她哥哥面前，他看到他的妹妹看起来多么美丽，眼睛都要瞪出来了。那件裙子是浅蓝色的，几乎和明日香选的那件一模一样。再加上她淡淡的妆容，让真司开始担心起来。

_"I'm going to have to beat the guys back with a stick after they see her today!"_ he thought to himself miserably, before he smiled and thought of how proud he was that his sister had come so far. "You look beautiful, Rei!" he complimented. A slight blush rose to her cheeks as he gazed upon her face.  
他心里想着，“今天让他们看到她后，我得用棍子把那些家伙赶走！”他想着自己的悲惨遭遇，然后微笑着想到他有多么自豪，他的妹妹走了这么远。“丽，你看起来美极了！”他赞美道。他凝视着她的脸庞，她的脸上泛起了淡淡的红晕。

"Thank you, Shinji," she said as she wrapped her arms around his waist and gave him a big hug before pulling back and looking into his steel blue eyes. "You look very handsome, yourself! Asuka is a very lucky girl!" She was pleased to see that this caused him to blush, as well.  
“谢谢你，真嗣，”她说着，一边将双臂环绕在他的腰间，紧紧拥抱了他一下，然后拉开距离，凝视着他那双钢蓝色的眼睛。“你看起来也很英俊！明日香真是个幸运的女孩！”她高兴地看到这让他脸红了。

"How's Asuka doing?" he asked, worry evident in his voice. When they had awakened that morning, she made a mad dash for the bathroom, followed closely by her startled fiancé. Shinji knew it was nerves mixed in with morning sickness, which had made an appearance once more in the days leading up to the wedding.  
“明日香怎么样了？”他问道，担忧之情溢于言表。当他们早上醒来时，她匆忙冲向浴室，她那惊讶的未婚夫紧随其后。真嗣知道这是紧张和早孕反应的混合，这些反应在婚礼前几天再次出现。

"She is fine, although her mood swings are quite interesting to watch. Misato and Heidi have had to fix her makeup several times since we got here," Rei answered as Shinji smiled slightly and shook his head. He thought that with a natural beauty such as Asuka's, makeup ( or as Touji calls it: _war paint_) would only serve to mask it, like using spray-paint on a DaVinci. "She wanted me to come by and see how you are doing. She is worried, it seems."  
“她很好，尽管她的情绪波动很有趣。自从我们到这里以来，美里和海蒂已经不止一次地帮她补妆了，”丽回答道，真嗣微微一笑，摇了摇头。他觉得像明日香这样自然美丽的女孩，化妆品（或者如东条所说的：战争涂料）只会掩盖她的美丽，就像在达芬奇画作上喷漆一样。“她让我过来看看你的情况。看起来她很担心。”

"Please tell her I'm fine," Shinji replied as he hugged her once more. "Thank you for being there for both of us, Rei. I just wish time would stop slowing down! I swear, every time I look at the clock, it's gone backwards!"  
“请告诉她我很好，”新吉再次拥抱她时回答道。“谢谢你一直在我们身边，零。我只希望时间不要再慢下来！我发誓，每次看表，时间都倒流了！”

"Have you seen the minister? Asuka said something about not wanting him to look like a highlander, or such. I did not understand what she meant, but I promised to see." Rei asked as she glanced around and noticing how nice Kaji, Touji, and Kensuke looked in their tuxedoes.  
“你见过部长吗？明日香说不想让他看起来像个苏格兰高地人，或者类似的。我不明白她什么意思，但我答应去看看。”零环顾四周，注意到卡儿、藤冢和健介穿着礼服看起来多么漂亮。

"Worry not, Lady Ayanami! I promised to leave my kilt at home this fine day!" boomed a massive voice as everyone turned to see Rev. Knight walk into the room, followed closely by Commander Fuyutsuki, who look splendid in his own tuxedo.  
“不用担心，绫波女士！我发誓今天这美好的一天我不会穿我的苏格兰裙！”一个巨大的声音响起，所有人转身看到骑士牧师走进房间，紧随其后的是穿着自己礼服的冯月司指挥官。

Shinji was relieved to see that the Reverend did not, in fact, walk in wearing a kilt. The mountain of a man who stood before him was wearing a black robe, trimmed in red. A red sash with tiny black writing of some sort was draped over his shoulders, and he had obviously trimmed his beard earlier into a more manageable goatee. His long hair was pulled back and held in place by the braids at his temples, which were also pulled back and joined at the back of his head. The only signs of jewelry on the man was the small pewter cross that hung from his neck and the silver chain that had been woven into his left braid.  
看到牧师并没有穿着苏格兰裙进来，真是让真司松了口气。站在他面前的这位高大的男人穿着一件黑袍，镶着红边。他肩上挂着一条红色的腰带，上面绣着一些黑色的小字，显然他之前修剪了胡须，变成了一把更容易打理的山羊胡。他的长发被梳起，用发辫固定在太阳穴处，再从后脑勺处汇聚在一起。这个男人身上唯一的饰物是挂在脖子上的小锡十字架，以及编织在左辫中的银链。

"Asuka will be very relieved to hear this, Reverend," Rei said as she bowed to the man and turned to take her leave. The Reverend, on the other hand, had other ideas. Kaji and Fuyutsuki noticed the gleam that danced in his eyes.  
“阿斯卡听到这个消息会很放心的，牧师，”丽说着向牧师鞠了一躬，转身准备离开。而牧师却有其他打算。卡吉和冬月察觉到了他眼中闪烁的光芒。

"As for my claymore, I promise not to use it until after the ceremony!" The Reverend laughed as Rei stopped dead in her tracks. She turned her head and gave him a worried look, as she was dreading telling this to the already stressed redhead that occupied the other room. The Reverend's laugh boomed even louder as he noticed her distress.  
“至于我的大剑，我保证在仪式结束后再使用！”牧师笑着说道，丽停下脚步。她转过头，担忧地看着他，因为她不敢告诉那位已经很紧张的红发女孩。牧师的笑声更加响亮，因为他察觉到了她的焦虑。

"I am sorry, Lady Ayanami! 'Twas merely a jest on my part and a poor one at that! Please forgive me, and give my best to the bride!" he laughed deeply as Rei shook her head slightly at the crazy giant and left as soon as she could. The Reverend's laugh and smile were infectious and soon, the atmosphere within the room had lightened immeasurably.  
“对不起，绫波女士！这只是我开的一个玩笑，而且还是一个很糟糕的玩笑！请原谅我，代我向新娘问好！”他深深地笑着，当零稍微摇了摇头，尽快离开。牧师的笑声和微笑是具有感染力的，很快，房间里的气氛明显变得轻松起来。

"So, gentlemen! The time draws nigh and soon we shall send the condemned to his fate! I do believe that you have something you wish to present, Lord Ikari, before we walk the last mile?" The Reverend teased as he turned the floor over to Shinji, who smirked at him over the teasing.  
“那么，先生们！时机渐近，很快我们将把被判的人送上绞刑架！我相信你有什么想要展示的，碇卿？在我们走向最后一程之前？”牧师戏弄着说，把话题转移到了真司身上，真司对着他的调侃咧嘴一笑。

"Er, thank you, Reverend!" Shinji said as he stood before his friends, the strange gaggle that they were. He reached into his duffle back and produced several wrapped packages. "The Reverend tells me that it is tradition for the groom to give his groomsmen gifts before the wedding. So Kaji, here's yours," He said as he handed his best man the small box. The look on his face was priceless as he opened the box.  
“呃，谢谢，牧师！”真司站在朋友们面前，他们是一群奇怪的人。他伸手进自己的背包，拿出几个包裹好的礼物。“牧师告诉我，按照传统，新郎要在婚礼前给伴郎们送礼物。所以，加持，这是你的礼物，”他递给他的伴郎一个小盒子。他打开盒子时的表情是无价的。

"Uh, thanks Shinji!" Kaji said, somewhat nervously as he placed the package within his tuxedo pocket. Inside was a note, reminding him of what he had promised Misato, along with a pair of small gold bands that Shinji knew he and Misato had looked at in the recent past. There were three words inscribed on each band, one saying_, I promise, Misato_, and the other saying the same, but with Kaji's name instead. Each one had a small gold chain running through it., so as to be worn around the neck. "How did you know?"  
"谢谢，真嗣！"卡琪有些紧张地说着，把包裹放进他的礼服口袋里。里面有一张便条，提醒他对美里的承诺，还有一对小金戒指，真嗣知道他和美里最近看过。每个戒指上刻着三个字，一个写着“我承诺”，“美里”，另一个写着同样的话，但是换成了卡琪的名字。每个戒指上都有一条小金链，可以挂在脖子上。“你怎么知道的？”

"You two talk louder than you think you do at night," Shinji replied with a crooked smile. Kaji's jaw was still on the ground.  
"“你们晚上说话的声音比你们想象的要大，”真嗣笑着回答。卡琪的下巴还在地上。"

" I promise not to let you down, Shinji! But you didn't have to…"  
"“我承诺不会让你失望，真嗣！但你不必……”"

"Yes, I did! You brought the love of my life here, and I'm just returning the favor! Besides, everyone needs a swift kick in the pants every once in a while, and we all have gotten tired of you two dancing around the subject, even though you asked her months ago. The mood won't get any better than it is now, so if not today, then sometime very, very soon!" Shinji replied, then added with a wicked grin. "Besides, I really need to plan _your_ bachelor party!" Kaji laughed so hard tears formed, then he went over and gave him his best man-hug.  
“是的，我做到了！你把我生命中的爱带到这里，我只是在回报而已！而且，每个人都需要偶尔受到一记猛烈的踢，我们都已经厌倦了你们两个绕着这个话题打转，尽管你几个月前就向她求婚了。现在的氛围不会再好过了，所以如果不是今天，那就是在不久的将来！” 真司回答道，然后带着邪恶的笑容补充道。“而且，我真的需要计划你的单身派对！” 加持笑得泪流满面，然后走过去给了他最好的伴郎拥抱。

"I promise," he whispered to Shinji, who nodded.  
“我保证，”他对着点头的真司低声说。

"I'm just tired of seeing you two hurt and lonely, that's all," Shinji replied as they broke the hug, and Shinji returned to giving out the gifts.  
“我只是厌倦看到你们两个受伤和孤独，仅此而已，” 真司在他们结束拥抱后回答道，然后真司继续分发礼物。

"Here you go, Touji!" Shinji said as he presented his friend with a larger box. Much to Touji's surprise, there were reservations for two in it to the restaurant that Shinji and Asuka had gone to the night Shinji had proposed, along with certificates for a limo, a dozen red roses and something wrapped up in a paper bag. "I thought it would be nice for you to be able to take Hikari out for the time of her life one night." Shinji's evil grin returned as he saw Touji's reaction to what was in the paper bag.  
“给你，刀二！”新吉高兴地递给他的朋友一个更大的盒子。让刀二惊讶的是，里面有两人份的预订，是新吉和明日香当晚去的那家餐厅，还有一辆豪华轿车的证书，一打红玫瑰，以及一个用纸袋包着的东西。“我觉得让你能带着希香度过她一生中最美好的一晚会很不错。”当新吉看到刀二对纸袋里的东西的反应时，他邪恶的笑容又回来了。

"WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!" a very shocked Touji screamed as he pulled the box of condoms from the bag they had resided in. Everyone in the room, especially Shinji and the Reverend, burst out in laughter at the look on Touji's face. A sheepish grin spread on his face as he realized that they were just a joke.  
“这是什么鬼东西？！”非常震惊的刀二从袋子里拿出了一盒避孕套。房间里的每个人，尤其是新吉和牧师，看到刀二的表情都笑得前仰后合。当他意识到这只是一个玩笑时，他脸上露出了尴尬的笑容。

"Just use them if you need them, Touji!" Shinji laughed as he wiped tears from his eyes. He was afraid he was going to have to pick the Reverend up from the floor if he continued to laugh as much as he was.  
“需要的话就用吧，刀二！”新吉笑着擦拭眼泪。他担心如果他继续笑得这么厉害，他就得把牧师从地板上扶起来。

"All right, Kensuke! It's your turn!" Shinji said as he handed a package to his otaku friend. Kensuke's eyes beamed when he tore the paper from it, revealing a thick book titled: _How to Pick Up Chicks!_ Kensuke immediately opened it up to sample it's wisdom.  
“好了，肯助！该你了！”新吉递给他的御宅族朋友一个包裹。肯助兴奋地撕开包装纸，露出一本厚厚的书，书名是：《如何泡妞！》肯助立刻翻开书本，试读其中的智慧。

"Cool! Thanks Shinji! Hey check this out! Step One: Open door. Step Two: Chase out the rooster…WHAT THE HELL?," he yelled as he continued to flip the pages, showing pictures of guys running around chasing chickens across their coops. This time, the Reverend did fall to the floor, laughing so hard that he could barely breath. He was followed quickly by the rest of the men in the room, even Fuyutsuki, which surprised everyone. Kensuke merely stood there and fumed.  
“酷！谢谢，新吉！嘿，看这个！第一步：打开门。第二步：赶走公鸡……这是什么鬼东西？”他大声喊道，继续翻页，展示着一些男人在鸡舍里追逐鸡的图片。这次，牧师笑倒在地板上，笑得几乎喘不过气来。房间里的其他男人也很快跟着笑了，甚至连冬树也笑了，这让所有人都感到惊讶。肯助只是站在那里，气得直发火。

"Don't…_heehee_…don't get mad, Kensuke! It's…it's…_Hah_!…it's just a joke!" Shinji wheezed as he got back to his feet, "Check out the back of the book, it'll make up for it!" With that Kensuke opened the back, the contents of which caused his jaw to hit the deck.  
“别……哈哈……别生气，肯助！这只是……哈哈！……开个玩笑！”新吉喘着气站起来说，“看看书的背面，会弥补的！”说着，肯助翻开书的背面，里面的内容让他的下巴都快掉下来了。

"Holy Shit! Oops! Sorry, Reverend!" Kensuke blurted out as he gazed lovingly on the blueprints that unfolded from the book. The look on his face was akin to that of a man's lustful leer at a nude centerfold. "Blueprints to the EVAs!"  
“天啊！糟糕！对不起，牧师！”肯助看着从书中展开的蓝图，脱口而出。他脸上的表情就像一个男人看着裸体中心页的色情目光。“EVA 的蓝图！”

"Shhh! Not too loud! They're just bare outlines and such! I couldn't supply you with any classified stuff, but I had hoped this would be alright," Shinji replied as he looked at his friend who had, to Shinji's amazement, tears in his eyes.  
“嘘！别太大声！它们只是简单的轮廓之类的东西！我不能给你任何机密的东西，但我希望这样可以。”新吉回答道，看着他的朋友，令新吉惊讶的是，他的眼睛里竟有泪水。

"Wow! This is great, man! You're the best, Shinji!" Kensuke said as he lovingly refolded the schematics and placed the gift into his duffle bag with great care. Shinji shook his head and smiled at how strange of a friend he had. He then turned to Fuyutsuki.  
“哇！太棒了，伙计！你是最棒的，新吉！”肯助说着，他爱抚地重新折叠了设计图，并小心翼翼地放进了他的背包里。新吉摇了摇头，微笑着看着他多么奇怪的朋友。然后他转向冬月。

"This is for you, sir," Shinji said as he handed Fuyutsuki a small box, almost the same size as the one he gave Kaji. "I know that you're giving Asuka away, but I still wanted to include you just like you were one of my groomsmen."  
“这是给您的，先生，”新吉递给冬月一个小盒子，几乎和他给加持的那个一样大小。“我知道您要把明日香嫁出去，但我还是想让您参与其中，就像您是我的一个伴郎一样。”

"Thank you, Shinji, I'm honored! If this is a ring, I'm afraid I have no one to give it to," the white-haired man chuckled as he opened the box and stared quizzically at the small memory chip stored within. "Uh, what exactly is this, Captain?"  
“谢谢你，新吉，我很荣幸！如果这是一个戒指，恐怕我没有人可以送给，”白发男子笑着打开盒子，好奇地盯着里面存放的小记忆芯片。“嗯，这到底是什么，船长？”

"Uh, well, since you knew my mother so well I thought you might like it. I did some research and got a hold of as many people as I could who knew my mother when she was a student. My father didn't do as good a job erasing her as he thought. On that chip, you'll find recordings of her music, pictures of her, as well as some video of concerts she was in as a cellist. Hours of it. I discovered that my mother was very popular with her friends!" Shinji said with a sad little smile as he tried to bring up memories of her. He saw the shocked look on Fuyutsuki's face as the older man held on to the box as if it was the most delicate thing ever created.  
“嗯，嗯，既然您和我母亲相识甚深，我觉得您可能会喜欢它。我做了一些调查，联系了尽可能多认识我母亲当学生时期的人。我父亲并没有像他想象的那样完全抹去她的存在。在那个芯片上，您会找到她的音乐录音，她的照片，以及一些她作为大提琴手参加音乐会的视频。有好几个小时的内容。我发现我母亲在朋友中很受欢迎！”新吉带着一丝悲伤的微笑说着，试图唤起他对母亲的记忆。他看到冬月惊讶的表情，老人紧握着盒子，仿佛那是有史以来最精致的东西一样。

"Um, er, Thank you, Shinji!" Fuyutsuki said past the painful lump that had formed in his throat. The images on this small chip were almost as valuable to him as they were to the young man who stood before him at this instance in time. "Do you have…?"  
“嗯，呃，谢谢你，真崎！”冬月喉咙里堵得生疼，他说道。这块小芯片上的图像对他来说几乎和站在他面前的年轻人一样宝贵。“你有吗…？”

"Several, sir. I just hope you enjoy it."  
“好几个，长官。希望您喜欢。”

"I'm sure I shall," the Commander replied, coughing softly. "Well, gentlemen, if you will excuse me, I believe that there is a certain young lady who awaits me. I'll see you in a little while, Shinji." With that, the old teacher took his leave.  
“我相信我会的，”指挥官轻咳了一声。“好了，先生们，如果你们请原谅，我相信有一个年轻女士在等我。过会儿见，真崎。”说完，老师离开了。

"Alright guys, if all the frivolity is over with," the Reverend announced with twinkle in his eye, "It's almost time! My lord, are you prepared to be enslaved?" The big man adjusted his sash as he looked Shinji squarely in the eyes. Shinji did not flinch as he gave his answer.  
“好了，伙计们，如果所有的轻松愉快都结束了，”牧师眼中闪烁着笑意宣布道，“差不多到时间了！我的主啊，你准备好被奴役了吗？”那个大个子调整了一下腰带，直视着真司的眼睛。真司毫不畏惧地回答道。

"Sir, I was enslaved the moment I met her, and do not regret it one little bit!"  
“先生，自从我遇见她的那一刻起，我就被奴役了，一点也不后悔！”

"Excellent! Just the answer I expected!" the minister boomed, laughing in such a way it reminded everyone of Santa Claus. Touji looked at him strangely, then opened his mouth to ask a question.  
“太棒了！正是我期待的回答！”牧师大声说着，笑声让每个人都想起了圣诞老人。刀二奇怪地看着他，然后张开嘴想要问一个问题。

"Excuse me, sir? I was just wondering…what purpose does your sash serve? Is it just decoration, or does it have some sort of significance?" the taller teenager asked, looking kind of perplexed. He looked at the long red sash, which reached from one knee, over his neck, and back down to the other knee. The Reverend grinned.  
“对不起，先生？我只是好奇……你的腰带有什么作用？它只是装饰品，还是有某种意义？”那位个子较高的少年问道，看起来有些困惑。他看着那条长长的红色腰带，从一条腿上绕过脖子，再回到另一条腿上。牧师笑了笑。

"It has a very meaningful purpose, good sir! It keeps my neck warm!" Rev. Knight laughed, seeing confusion on the young man's face. "I can wrap it around my head too, if I want to go around and play ninja!"  
“它有着非常有意义的用途，先生！它可以保暖我的脖子！”骑士牧师笑着说，看到年轻人脸上的困惑。“我还可以把它绕在头上，如果想要扮演忍者的话！”

"Uh, okay," Touji answered back, his eyes glazing over, "but what's with the funny little writing on it? That's not Japanese."  
“嗯，好的，”投士回答道，他的眼睛有些发直，“但上面那些奇怪的小字是什么意思？那不是日文。”

"It's Norse Runes. A friend of mine in Iceland sent this to me as a present just prior to Second Impact. Some of my favorite sayings are embroidered upon it!" Now Kensuke came forward and began to study the writing.  
“这是北欧符文。冰岛的一个朋友在第二次冲击前送给我的礼物。上面绣着一些我最喜欢的格言！”肯努基走上前开始研究上面的文字。

"Well, I see the Lord's Prayer, John 3:16, Psalms 23, and ….what the heck_? Pain is Temporary, Glory is Eternal, Chicks dig Scars! I will not Fear. Fear is the mind killer…"_  
“好吧，我看到主祷文、约翰福音 3:16、诗篇 23，还有……什么鬼？痛苦是暂时的，荣耀是永恒的，妹子喜欢疤痕！我不会害怕。恐惧是心灵杀手……”

"I never said all my favorite sayings were from the Bible, did I?" The Reverend commented with a lopsided grin as he lined the men up in proper order and then sent Touji and Kensuke out one door to meet up with the bridesmaids, then lead Shinji and Kaji through the side door to the chapel.  
“我从来没说过我所有最喜欢的格言都来自圣经，对吧？”牧师一边笑着一边让男人们排好队，然后让投治和肯努基从一扇门出去，去见伴娘，然后带领真司和加持通过侧门进入教堂。

"You're sure he's not in a kilt, right Rei?" Asuka stammered as she continued to pace dressing room, her color nowhere near what it was normally. The anxiety of the upcoming wedding, now merely moments away, was really doing a number on her normally calm demeanor. She was still pale from being sick earlier in the day, as her baby decided that it didn't like how nervous it's mother was. Misato and Heidi trailed Asuka across the room, holding up the train of her dress so the agitated bride-to-be wouldn't get all entangled within it and fall flat on her face. "No sign of any sword?"  
“你确定他没有穿苏格兰裙，莱？”明日香结巴着说着，一边在更衣室里踱来踱去，她的脸色远不如平时那般。即将到来的婚礼带来的焦虑，此刻已近在眼前，让她这位平日里沉稳的人显得焦躁不安。她因为早些时候生病而仍然苍白，因为她的宝宝觉得它的妈妈太紧张了。美里和海蒂跟在明日香身后穿梭，托起她的礼服长裙，以免这位焦躁的新娘被缠在里面，摔个四脚朝天。“没有看到任何剑的踪迹吗？”

"He is not wearing a kilt, but a black and red robe instead," Rei replied as she tried to get the nervous redhead to relax. "Nor did I see any sword." Asuka's bouquet was shaking so badly that it sounded like a den full of angry rattlesnakes. A knock on the door startled everyone.  
“他没有穿苏格兰裙，而是穿着黑色和红色的长袍，”零回答道，试图让紧张的红发女郎放松下来。“我也没有看到任何剑。”明日香的花束颤抖得厉害，听起来像是一窝愤怒的响尾蛇。门外传来一阵敲门声，吓了所有人一跳。

"Hello? Is everyone decent?" Commander Fuyutsuki asked as he slowly peeked around the door before being motioned in by Heidi. "Asuka, you look lovely today!" Asuka stopped her pacing and beamed at the white haired gentleman before her.  
“喂？大家都穿得体面吗？”冈田指挥官问道，慢慢地从门后探出头，然后被海蒂示意进来。“明日香，你今天看起来很可爱！”明日香停下了脚步，对着眼前的白发绅士露出了灿烂的笑容。

"Thank you, Commander!" she answered as she went and gave Fuyutsuki a hug, trying to draw strength from the old man.  
“谢谢，指挥官！”她回答道，一边给冬树一个拥抱，试图从这位老人身上汲取力量。

"Not _commander_ today, Asuka. Just call me Kozo," Fuyutsuki replied, which got him another hug. "So, are we ready?" Asuka shook her head.  
“今天不要叫我指挥官了，明日香。就叫我孝三吧，”冬树回答道，这让他再次被拥抱。“那么，我们准备好了吗？”明日香摇了摇头。

"There is still one more thing to do," Heidi said as she and the other ladies gathered around. "Something old…" she recited as she held out the white cameo that had been in Asuka's family for ages and placed it around her niece's neck.  
“还有一件事要做，”海蒂说道，她和其他女士们聚集在一起。“一件古老的事情……”她背诵着，一边拿出了明日香家族传承已久的白色贝壳浮雕，然后把它戴在了侄女的脖子上。

"Something new…" Hikari continued as she handed Asuka her engagement ring, which she then placed on her right hand, seeing how the ring finger on her left hand would be occupied soon.  
“有件新事……”希望继续说着，递给明日香她的订婚戒指，然后她戴在右手上，看着她左手的无名指很快就会被占据。

"Something borrowed…" Misato added as she removed her silver cross from around her neck and placed it on Asuka, who's eyes began to well up with tears. Asuka gave Misato her version of a Misato-sized bear hug, causing the lavender haired woman to cry. "I just want it back when you're done, okay?" She teased as they both dabbed their eyes dry.  
“有件借来的东西……”美里补充道，她从脖子上取下银十字架戴在明日香身上，明日香的眼睛开始湿润起来。明日香给了美里一个大小合适的熊抱，导致这位紫发女人哭了。“等你用完了记得还给我，好吗？”她开玩笑地说着，两人擦干眼泪。

"Something blue," Rei finished as she held out the garter that Kaji had given Shinji. Asuka raised the hem of her dress and slipped the garter up her thigh almost to the top of the white stockings she was wearing especially for Shinji. Fuyutsuki saw this and quickly turned around, causing Asuka to blush.  
“有件蓝色的东西，”惠儿说完，她拿出加持给新吉的腿箍。明日香提起裙摆，将腿箍戴到大腿上，几乎到了她为新吉特意穿的白色长筒袜的顶端。冬月看到这一幕，赶紧转身，导致明日香脸红了。

"Sorry, Kozo," she apologized sheepishly as quickly dropped hem of her dress. Fuyutsuki continued to keep his back turned as he cleared his throat. "I didn't mean to embarrass you!"  
“对不起，孝三，”她羞怯地道歉，迅速拉下裙摆。冬月继续背对着她，清了清嗓子。“我不是故意让你尴尬的！”

"It alright, Asuka, it just means you've accepted me into this clan," he replied as he turned back around to face her, his face still a bit red. "It was, however, a very shapely leg!" Fuyutsuki said with a crooked grin, causing Asuka to blush once more.  
“没关系，明日香，这只是表示你已经接受我加入这个家族了，”他回答道，转过身来面对她，脸上还有些许泛红。“不过，那是一条非常修长的腿！”冬月带着一丝歪笑说道，让明日香再次脸红。

"Okay, now I'm ready!" Asuka said with confidence as she blew out some air and relaxed her shoulders, trying to look like she was calming down. It fooled no one.  
“好了，现在我准备好了！”明日香自信地说道，吹了口气，放松了肩膀，试图看起来像是在冷静下来。但没有人被骗住。

"Really?" Heidi asked, her arms crossed and tapping her foot. Asuka wilted.  
“真的吗？”海蒂问道，双臂交叉，轻轻踢着脚。明日香垂头丧气。

"No," she said weakly, as her bouquet began to shake again. Fuyutsuki placed his hand on hers, patting it gently.  
“不，”她虚弱地说道，她的花束又开始颤抖。冬月轻轻地放在她的手上，温柔地拍着。

"Don't worry, my dear," he said gently and warmly, "Just remember that there is a good man who loves you more than life itself waiting for you at the end of the aisle. Just ignore everyone else and you'll be fine."  
“别担心，亲爱的，”他温柔而热情地说道，“只要记住，在过道尽头等着你的是一个爱你胜过生命的好男人。忽略其他人，你就会没事的。”

"Thank…thank you," she stammered back, calming somewhat at the older gentleman's touch and words.  
“谢…谢谢你，"她结结巴巴地回答，在年长绅士的触摸和话语下有些平静了起来。

"Okay, Heidi, if you'll head out and take your seat, we can begin. Rei, Hikari, the boys are waiting outside the door for you. Go ahead and line up with them, Misato will be right behind you. Asuka and I will follow." Fuyutsuki said in his best professor's voice as everyone scurried to follow his instructions. Soon, everyone had left the dressing room and had lined up outside the chapel's front doors, ready for the main event to begin.  
“好的，海蒂，你去坐好，我们就可以开始了。 玲，光，男孩们正在门外等你们。 走吧，和他们排队，美里会跟在你们后面的。明日香和我会跟着。” 冬月以他最像教授的声音说着，所有人匆匆忙忙地按照他的指示行动起来。很快，所有人都离开了化妆室，站在礼堂前门外排队，准备开始主要活动。

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shinji looked like he was ready to defecate in his pants. His face went through colors faster than the color wheel at a dance club, first red, white, green, blue, then normal, then starting all over again. Despite the confidence he had felt all this time, he was still scared, and scared badly. Much to his relief, his best man noticed, as did the minister, who did their best to cheer him up and calm him down. It helped. Some. Kind of.  
新吉看起来像是随时要在裤子里拉屎一样。 他的脸色变化得比舞厅的色轮还快，先是红色，白色，绿色，蓝色，然后正常，再重新开始。尽管他一直以来都感到自信，但他仍然害怕，而且非常害怕。 令他松了口气的是，他的伴郎注意到了，牧师也注意到了，他们尽力让他振作起来，让他平静下来。 这有些帮助。 有点。

"There…there is a lot of people here, huh? Kaji?" Shinji muttered out the side of his mouth as he scanned the crowd. Just about everyone he knew or had seen at NERV was in attendance, with one notable exception. Even Dr. Akagi was there, sitting next to Maya Ibuki. Shigeru Aoba was on her other side, patting her hand as she wiped tears from her eyes. Akagi was glancing around, as if she were looking for someone, but kept turning back to the front with a disappointed look on her face. Makoto Hyuga sat with the other two bridge bunnies and kept passing tissues to Shigeru to hand to Maya. Dr. Akagi just rolled her eyes in disgust.  
“这里…这里有很多人，对吧？卡琪？”新吉边扫视人群，边嘟囔着。几乎他认识或在 NERV 见过的每个人都在场，只有一个显著的例外。甚至阿凯博士也在那里，坐在真咲伊吹旁边。青羽满是泪痕，正被青羽轻拍着手，擦拭着眼泪。阿凯博士四处张望，仿佛在找人，但每次都失望地转回正前方。日向真人和其他两位桥员坐在一起，不断递纸巾给青羽。阿凯博士只是不屑地翻了个白眼。”

"Yes, there is, Shinji! Just imagine, your wedding is the social event of the year!" Kaji replied as he noticed the younger man's color actually get paler. "Actually, it not that bad! I've been to some humdingers in my day!" Kaji chuckled as Shinji did everything he could to clamp down on his nervousness.  
“是的，新吉！想象一下，你的婚礼是今年社交界的盛事！”卡琪看到年轻人的脸色竟然变得更苍白，便回答道。“其实，也没那么糟糕！我这辈子参加过一些盛大的聚会！”卡琪笑着，而新吉则竭力控制着自己的紧张情绪。

"Do you have the rings?" Shinji asked as he fought the urge to start bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet. Kaji chuckled louder.  
"“戒指带来了吗？”新吉忍住脚尖踮起的冲动，问道。卡琪笑声更大了。”

"Yes, Shinji, for the tenth time. I have the rings," Kaji reassured as he patted the pocket of his jacket. Shinji and Asuka didn't know anyone who had a younger brother to act as ring bearer, so Kaji agreed to carry the rings for them.  
“是的，新吉，已经是第十次了。我有戒指，”卡琪在拍了拍夹克口袋时安抚道。新吉和明日香都没有年纪小一点的弟弟可以担任送戒指的人，所以卡琪同意替他们带戒指。

"Are you sure?" Shinji asked once more, rather desperately, until he felt a large hand land on his shoulders, filling him with calm.  
“你确定吗？”新吉再次询问，显得相当绝望，直到感觉到一只大手轻轻地落在他的肩膀上，给他带来了平静。

"Do not worry, young lord," Rev. Knight said soothingly in Shinji's ear, "Just remember why you are here and forget everyone else. Just think of how much you love your young lady, and all will be well. Trust me, I have done a few of these in my time, and thus far everything is going great!" He felt Shinji relax under his grip, as the words sank in.  
“不要担心，年轻主人，”骑士牧师在新吉耳边温和地说道，“只需记住你为何而来，忘记其他人。只想想你有多么爱你的年轻女士，一切都会好起来的。相信我，我这辈子做过几次这样的事情，到目前为止一切都进行得很顺利！”他感觉到新吉在他的控制下放松了下来，这些话语渐渐深入他的心灵。

Shinji looked around some more and was impressed with the arraignments for the wedding. The thing that brought the biggest smile to his face was the string quintet that sat over to the side and played several gentle tunes, helping to relieve the tension that was in the air, the same tension that was present in all weddings. He noticed several people that he had no clue would show up, as well. Ichigo, the bass player for _Orgasmo and the Flatulent Five_ was there, obviously invited my Rei. Thomas Sky was present, which was all well and good since his restaurant was the one catering the event. Mr. Takayamagi was present as well, which surprised and delighted Shinji to no end. He knew Asuka must have sent him an invitation, though he had no way of knowing how Asuka had found out about him. Suddenly, Shinji's breath caught in his throat, as he watched Heidi walk down the aisle and take her place on the bride's side of the chapel, in the space reserved for the mother of the bride.  
真司再四环顾四周，对婚礼的布置印象深刻。让他最开心的是一旁的弦乐五重奏，他们演奏了几首温柔的曲调，缓解了空气中的紧张氛围，这种氛围在所有婚礼上都存在。他还注意到一些他完全不知道会出现的人。比如，Orgasmo 乐队和 Flatulent Five 的贝斯手一期，显然是被丽邀请来的。Thomas Sky 也在场，这很好，因为他的餐厅负责承办这个活动。高山木先生也在场，这让真司感到惊喜和高兴。他知道明日香一定是给他寄了邀请函，尽管他不知道明日香是如何得知他的。突然间，真司的呼吸停顿了，当他看着海蒂走下过道，站在教堂新娘一侧为新娘母亲留的位置上时。

"Here we go, young lord," the Reverend said as the musicians began to play _Air_ by Bach, causing Shinji and Kaji to stand straighter. "Good choice, by the way, but I do prefer Mozart myself!" the Reverend chuckled, causing him to go up a notch in Shinji's book.  
“开始吧，年轻的领主，”牧师说着，音乐家们开始演奏巴赫的《空气》，让真司和加持挺直了身子。“选得不错，不过我更喜欢莫扎特！”牧师笑着说，让他在真司心中的形象又上升了一个档次。

Time slowed down as he watched his sister and Kensuke appear at the door and slowly march down the aisle arm-in-arm before they reached the stairs, where they split from one another and took their places furthest from Shinji. Next, Touji and Hikari walked in, looking like the perfect couple. There was a contented smile on their faces that Shinji had never seen before. He could tell Touji was doing his best to keep from limping and bumping into Hikari. The two of them walked in perfect step with one another as they, too, took their places on each side of Shinji.  
当他看着妹妹和健介出现在门口，缓缓地手挽手走下过道，然后分开，在楼梯处分别站定，离真司最远时，时间仿佛变得缓慢。接着，刀司和光步入，看起来像是完美的一对。他们脸上带着满足的微笑，真司从未见过。他能看出刀司在尽力不让自己跛行撞到光。他们两人完美地步调一致，也分别站在真司的两侧。

The next person to walk down the aisle, with her bouquet in her hand, was Misato as Maid of Honor. Kaji's heart leapt to his throat at the sight before him, as she was a vision of beauty in her bridesmaid's dress, with the light shining brightly from the tears of happiness in her eyes. She looked up at Shinji and gave him a smile and a wink, then looked toward Kaji with hope and love in her eyes. Doing something completely out of character, she shyly looked toward the ground as she continued to walk toward the alter. Something inside Kaji snapped, as he felt his heart go toward the woman he had known for years would have to be his wife.  
接下来走上通道的是伴娘美里手捧花束。卡琪看到她的样子，心里一跳，她穿着伴娘礼服，眼中闪烁着幸福的泪光，美丽动人。她抬头看着真嗣，微笑着向他眨眼，然后转向卡琪，眼中充满希望和爱意。她做了一件完全不同寻常的事情，害羞地低头继续走向祭坛。卡琪内心某处似乎断裂了，他感觉自己的心已经倾向于这位多年来一直认为会成为他妻子的女人。

"Get ready to plan the party," Kaji whispered out of the side of his mouth, his will resolute and strong. Shinji grinned.  
“准备好筹划派对了，”卡琪嘴角轻声说道，意志坚定而坚强。真嗣咧嘴一笑。

"Gotcha," he whispered back as Misato made her way up the steps and took her place, glancing sideways over to the best man, who flashed her his most genuine smile. Suddenly the music stopped, before starting once more, this time the more familiar _Wedding March_ drifting throughout the Chapel as everyone stood and turned their attention to the doors at the back.  
“知道了，”他轻声回答，美里走上台阶就位，斜眼看向伴郎，后者向她展示了最真诚的微笑。突然间音乐停止了，然后重新响起，这次是更为熟悉的婚礼进行曲在教堂中回荡，所有人站起来，将注意力转向后面的大门。

A single tear forced its way out of the corner of Shinji's eye as he stared at the sight before him. No words ever written my man could express how he felt as he watched his Red-Headed Goddess marching down the aisle on Fuyutsuki's arm, all her attention, love and emotion focused squarely on him. She was now his Goddess in White, and he would gladly fall and worship at her feet for the remainder of his life, freely giving up his own if that was her wish. He would slay every Angel and Demon in Heaven and Hell if it would please her, and God help anyone or anything that ever threatened his beloved. He felt as if he could sprout wings right now and soar amongst the clouds, with her in his arms. That was how free and uplifted his heart felt as she slowly closed in on the altar.  
当新吉凝视着眼前的景象时，一滴眼泪顽强地从他眼角流出。任何人所写的文字都无法表达他此刻的心情，他看着他的红发女神挽着冬月的胳膊缓缓走过礼堂，她的所有关注、爱意和情感都专注在他身上。她现在是他的白衣女神，他愿意一生跪拜在她脚下，甘愿放弃自己的一切，只要她愿意。如果这能让她开心，他愿意屠戮天堂和地狱中的每一个天使和恶魔，任何威胁他心爱的人的人或事都要小心了。他感觉自己仿佛可以长出翅膀，与她一起飞翔在云端。当她慢慢走近祭坛时，他的心情是如此自由和振奋。

Slowly, she and Fuyutsuki mounted the steps and marched up to the altar, where Fuyutsuki shook Shinji's hand then placed Asuka's hand within Shinji's. The white haired gentleman walked back down the steps and took his place next to Heidi, as Asuka and Shinji gazed lovingly into each other's eyes. She saw the tears that poured joyfully down his face and smiled so sweetly that it caused his heart to swell to ten times it's normal size.  
慢慢地，她和冬月走上台阶，向祭坛走去，冬月与新吉握手，然后将明日香的手放在新吉手中。那位白发绅士走回台阶，站在海蒂身边，而明日香和新吉深情地凝视着彼此的眼睛。她看到他脸上洋溢着喜悦的泪水，微笑着那么甜蜜，让他的心膨胀到正常大小的十倍。

"Stop it, dummy, before you get me going!" she whispered to him as she saw the look of sheer joy on his face.  
“别闹了，笨蛋，免得我也跟着感动！”她对他耳语道，看到他脸上纯粹的喜悦表情。

"Too late!" he whispered back as he noticed the same tears streaming down her face as well. She smiled back as the music stopped and they turned to the Reverend. The bridesmaids and groomsmen shuffled over to the sides, allowing Asuka, Shinji, and the Reverend to become the center of everyone's attention.  
“为时已晚！”他耳语回应，注意到她脸上也有泪水流下。当音乐停止时，他们转向牧师。伴娘和伴郎们走到一旁，让明日香、新吉和牧师成为所有人关注的焦点。

"You two ready?" the Reverend whispered as he saw the looks they were giving each other before turning to him and nodding. "Most excellent!"  
"你们准备好了吗？" 牧师低声问道，看到他们相互之间的眼神，然后转向他们点头。“太棒了！”

"My dear friends," the Reverend boomed as he spread his hands to all in the chapel, " we have come here on this fine day to witness the joining of Asuka and Shinji in the bonds of holy matrimony, which is commended to be honorable amongst all men, and therefore is not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly, but reverently, discreetly, advisedly, and solemnly. It is into this holy estate that these two young people, brave warriors and loving friends both, have now come to be joined. If there is any person here that can show just cause why they may not be joined together, let them speak now, or hold their peace forever more!" The Reverend's attention seemed to be focused on a spot toward the back of the chapel, but when no voice was raised in protest, he smiled, as did the couple before him as he continued with the service.  
"亲爱的朋友们，" 牧师在教堂里向所有人伸开双手大声说道，“我们在这美好的一天聚集在这里，见证明日福音和真嗣在圣婚的羁绊中结合，这是被所有人认为是高尚的，因此不应该轻率地或草率地进入，而应该虔诚地、谨慎地、审慎地和庄严地。这两位年轻人，勇敢的战士和彼此深爱的朋友，现在走到了这个神圣的境地。如果这里有任何人有正当理由认为他们不应该结合在一起，让他们现在说出来，否则就永远保持沉默！” 牧师的目光似乎集中在教堂后面的某处，但当没有人提出异议时，他微笑了，站在他面前的这对夫妇也微笑着，他继续进行仪式。"

"Now, who gives this woman on this day to be wedded to this man?" The Reverend asked the assembly as Fuyutsuki stood up, tall and proud, with a serene look on his face.  
"“现在，谁愿意把这位女士交给这位男士，让他们在今天结为夫妇？” 牧师问着众人，而冯筑城站起来，昂首挺胸，脸上带着一丝宁静的表情。"

"Her aunt and I do, Reverend," he said then sat back down beside Heidi and took her hand, comforting her. Heidi looked up at the Reverend, a smile on her face despite the tears, as he beamed back at her. The Reverend nodded to them both as he opened a book before him and began to read.  
“牧师，我和她的阿姨会的。”他说完后重新坐到海蒂身边，握住她的手，安慰着她。尽管泪水滑落，海蒂抬头看着牧师，脸上带着微笑，而牧师也面带笑容看着她。牧师向他们点了点头，打开面前的一本书，开始朗读。

"_But ultimately there comes a moment when a decision must be made. Ultimately two people who love each other must ask themselves how much they hope for as their love grows and deepens, and how much risk they are willing to take…It is indeed a fearful gamble…Because it is the nature of love to create, a marriage itself is something which has to be created, so that, together we become a new creature._  
“但最终总会有一个决定的时刻。最终，两个相爱的人必须问自己，随着爱情的成长和加深，他们希望得到多少，愿意承担多大的风险……这确实是一场可怕的赌博……因为爱的本质是创造，婚姻本身也是必须创造的东西，这样，我们一起成为一个新的生命。”

_To marry is the biggest risk in human relations that a person can take…If we commit ourselves to one person for life this is not, as many people think, a rejection of freedom; rather it demands the courage to move into all the risks of freedom, and the risk of love which is permanent; into that love which is not possession, but participation…It takes a lifetime to learn another person…When love is not possession, but participation, then it is part of that co-creation which is our human calling, and which implies such risk that it is often rejected."  
结婚是人际关系中一个人能够承担的最大风险……如果我们把自己托付给一个人一生，这并不是很多人所认为的对自由的拒绝；相反，这需要勇气去承担所有自由的风险，以及永恒的爱的风险；投入那种不是占有而是参与的爱……了解另一个人需要一生的时间……当爱不是占有而是参与时，它就成为我们人类使命的共同创造的一部分，这意味着如此大的风险，以至于经常被拒绝。_

"That is what one of my favorite authors wrote about marriage in her book_, The Irrational Season._ She was right, it is the nature of true love to create. A marriage is something that is created. It must be nurtured, it must grow, for that is the way of Nature. If there is no growth, there is naught but stagnation and death. Unlike what many people may think, marriage is not a prison sentence. It the freely giving of oneself: mind, body and soul. It is knowing that you cannot live another day, another hour, another moment without that one special person in your life." The Reverend smiled as he looked at the young people before him.  
“这就是我最喜欢的一位作家在她的书《非理性的季节》中写到婚姻的内容。她说得对，真爱的本质就是创造。婚姻是一种创造。它必须被呵护，它必须成长，因为这是自然的方式。如果没有成长，就只有停滞和死亡。与许多人的想法不同，婚姻不是一种监禁。它是自由地奉献自己：心灵、身体和灵魂。这是知道你不能没有生活中那个特别的人度过另一天，另一个小时，另一刻。”牧师微笑着看着他面前的年轻人。

"It is a risk, but one that takes the utmost in courage with the greatest of rewards. The sheer joy of holding that one special person knows no bounds, the knowledge that the two of you will build a life together which is so much greater than the life anyone could build alone is greater than all the knowledge of facts and things within God's great universe. The two become one, two worlds become an universe unto itself. It is this universe that Asuka and Shinji have come together to create this day. These two young people, whom others would call children, have laid down their lives time and time again for the benefit of others, never once looking back or regretting their actions in service to their fellow humans. Now is their time, now is the time for us to witness their happiness, as they go forth and build a life together. A life based on mutual love and mutual respect, not on the vulgarities of the flesh, not in the lust for things, or the wanting of that which is truly beyond our grasp." Once more, this last part was directed to the back of the chapel, though no one noticed.  
这是一个冒险，但需要极大的勇气，回报也是最丰厚的。拥有那个特别的人带来的纯粹喜悦无法言喻，你们将共同建立的生活远比任何人单独建立的生活更伟大，这超越了上帝伟大宇宙中所有事实和事物的知识。两个人成为一体，两个世界成为一个独立的宇宙。正是这个宇宙让明日香和真嗣在今天走到一起创造。这两个年轻人，别人或许称之为孩子，他们一次又一次地为他人利益而舍弃自己的生命，从未回头，也从未后悔为他们的同胞服务的行动。现在是他们的时候，现在是我们见证他们幸福的时候，他们将共同前行，建立一个基于相互爱和相互尊重的生活。这不是基于肉体的低俗，也不是贪欲物质，或者追求我们无法触及的东西。最后这段话再次是对着教堂后面说的，尽管没有人注意到。

"Their love knows no bounds, and it will only continue to grow as the years pass. The vows you take this day are binding and strong, stronger than any force that Mankind in all it's arrogance has ever created. It is a bond strong and true, of which no power within Heaven, Hell, or Terra may split asunder, for it is a bond brought forth by the Creator himself." The Reverend said this last line with deadly seriousness, before his eternal smile returned once more. "Now, it is time for the couple to say a few things, and give this long winded minister a rest!" Light laughter echoed throughout the Chapel, breaking the tension that had built up. Asuka and Shinji laughed as they turned to face each other.  
他们的爱无边无际，随着岁月的流逝只会不断增长。你们今天所许下的誓言是牢不可破的，比人类所有傲慢创造的任何力量都要强大。这是一种坚定真挚的羁绊，没有天堂、地狱或大地上的任何力量能够分开，因为这是创造者亲自铸造的羁绊。牧师说完这句话时，神情严肃至极，然后他永恒的微笑再次回到脸上。“现在，是时候让新人说几句话了，让这位唠叨的牧师休息一下！”礼堂里响起轻快的笑声，打破了紧张气氛。明日香和真嗣笑着转身面对彼此。

"I, Shinji Ikari, take you, Asuka Soryu, to be my wedded Wife, my constant friend, my faithful partner and my love from this day forward. In the presence of our family and friends, I offer you my solemn vow to be your faithful partner in sickness and in health, in good times and in bad, and in joy as well as in sorrow. I will cherish our union and love you more each day than I did the day before. I promise to love you unconditionally, to support you in your goals, to honor and respect you, to laugh with you and cry with you, and to cherish you for as long as we both shall live." Shinji said as he looked deep within her eyes and held her trembling hands. He smiled as he finished up the vows as he mouthed "_I love you"_ to her.  
"我，碇真嗣，愿意娶你，惣流·明日香，做我的妻子，我的挚友，我的忠实伴侣，从今天起成为我的爱人。在家人和朋友的见证下，我郑重承诺，无论疾病还是健康，无论顺境还是逆境，无论欢乐还是悲伤，我都会忠诚地陪伴在你身旁。我会珍惜我们的关系，每一天都比昨天更爱你。我承诺无条件地爱你，支持你的目标，尊重你，与你共笑共泪，珍惜你直到生命尽头。”真嗣深情地凝视着她的眼眸，握着她颤抖的双手说道。他微笑着结束誓言，轻声对她说：“我爱你。”

_"I love you too,"_ Asuka mouthed back as she began her vows, ""I, Asuka Soryu, take you, Shinji Ikari, to be my wedded Husband, my constant friend, my faithful partner and my love from this day forward. In the presence of our family and friends, I offer you my solemn vow to be your faithful partner in sickness and in health, in good times and in bad, and in joy as well as in sorrow. I will cherish our union and love you more each day than I did the day before. I promise to love you unconditionally, to support you in your goals, to honor and respect you, to laugh with you and cry with you, and to cherish you for as long as we both shall live." Her smile as she finished outshone the Sun. Together, they continued to hold hands as they came to end of the vows.  
"我也爱你,"明日香默默地回应着，开始她的誓言，"我，惣流·明日香，愿意嫁给你，碇真嗣，做你的丈夫，永远的朋友，忠实的伴侣，从今天起成为你的爱人。在家人和朋友的见证下，我郑重承诺成为你忠实的伴侣，无论疾病还是健康，无论顺境还是逆境，无论欢乐还是悲伤。我会珍惜我们的关系，每一天比昨天更爱你。我承诺无条件地爱你，支持你的目标，尊重你，与你同笑共泣，珍惜你直到生命尽头。"她完成誓言时的微笑比太阳还灿烂。他们手牵手，继续走向誓言的终点。

"Beg me not to leave you, or to return from following after you, For where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your family will be my family, and your belief will be my belief. And where you die, I will die, and there shall my body be buried. May the Creator do with me and more if anything but death parts us." they said in perfect unison, brings goose bumps to the Reverend's arms, for he had never heard anyone ever speak in unison so perfectly. It was their synch training coming forth once more. The Reverend cleared his throat as he once more spoke from his book. It was another favorite passage of his, this one from _The Prophet_.  
“不要求我离开你，或者从你后面回来，因为你去哪里，我就去哪里，你住在哪里，我就住在哪里。你的家人将成为我的家人，你的信仰将成为我的信仰。你死在哪里，我就死在哪里，我的尸体就葬在那里。创造者若不除了死亡之外的事情来分开我们，愿祂对我怎样。”他们完美地齐声说道，让牧师的手臂起了鸡皮疙瘩，因为他从未听过有人如此完美地齐声说话。这是他们的同步训练再次显现。牧师清了清嗓子，再次从书上念起。这是他的另一个最喜欢的段落，来自《先知》。

_" Love has no other desire but to fulfill itself.  
“爱再没有别的欲望，只是实现自己。”  
But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires:  
“但如果你爱，又必须有欲望，让这些成为你的欲望：”  
To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.  
融化，像一条流淌的小溪，向夜晚吟唱其旋律。  
To know the pain of too much tenderness.  
懂得过多温柔的痛苦。  
To be wounded by your own understanding of love;  
被自己对爱的理解所伤。  
And to bleed willingly and joyfully.  
甘心且欣然地流血。  
To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;  
在黎明醒来，怀着一颗飞翔的心，感恩又一天的爱；  
To rest at the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy;  
在正午休息，沉思爱的狂喜；  
To return home at eventide with gratitude;  
在黄昏时分怀着感恩回家；  
And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise on your lips."  
然后带着对心爱之人的祈祷和赞美之歌入睡。_

"And now, it is time for Asuka and Shinji to bring forth and exchange the symbols of their love and commitment to each other," Rev. Knight announced as Kaji reached within his jacket pocket and placed the two rings on the closed book in the Reverend's hands. Asuka and Shinji were trembling rather violently now, the rustling of her bouquet loud within the silent chapel. "Gold. Most precious of metals, less than nothing in the eyes of the Creator, but symbolizing the value we place on love. A Ring, a perfect circle. An eternal loop, representing the endless and timeless love these two share for one another. Shinji, take this ring, place it on Asuka's finger, and speak the words that lay within your heart."  
“现在，是阿斯卡和真嗣交换和展示彼此爱意和承诺的时候了，”奈特牧师宣布，卡吉伸手进口袋，将两枚戒指放在牧师手中合上的书上。阿斯卡和真嗣此刻颤抖得厉害，她手中的花束在寂静的教堂里发出嘈杂的声响。“黄金，最珍贵的金属，在造物主眼中微不足道，但象征着我们对爱的珍视。戒指，一个完美的圆环。永恒的循环，代表着这两人彼此之间无尽和永恒的爱。真嗣，接过这枚戒指，戴在阿斯卡的手指上，并说出你心中的真情。”

"Asuka," Shinji said past the lump in his throat, not caring if the tears streaming down his face could be seen by anyone else but the lady before him, " I give you this ring as a symbol of my love and faithfulness. As I place it on your finger, I commit my heart and soul to you. I ask you to wear this ring as a reminder of the vows we have spoken today, our wedding day. With this ring, I thee wed." With trembling hands, he carefully and lovingly slid it onto the ring finger of her left hand. A small sob escaped Asuka's lips as her smile continued to provide the sunshine to Shinji's world.  
“明日香，” 看着眼前的女士，新吉喉咙里有个硌子，他不在乎自己脸上流下的泪水是否被别人看见，“我送你这枚戒指，作为我爱你和忠诚的象征。当我把它戴在你的手指上时，我将我的心灵奉献给你。我请求你戴上这枚戒指，作为我们今天说过的誓言，我们的婚礼日的提醒。用这枚戒指，我愿与你结为夫妻。” 他颤抖的双手小心翼翼地把戒指戴在她左手的无名指上。明日香的嘴角微微颤抖，她的微笑继续为新吉的世界带来阳光。

"Asuka, take this ring and place it on Shinji's finger, and speak the words that lay within your heart." the Reverend said with a gentle smile, tears threatening to slide down his cheeks as well. He had rarely seen two people who loved each other as much as these two do, and their unabashed display of emotion was beginning to get to him as well.  
“明日香，拿起这枚戒指，戴在新吉的手指上，并说出你心中的真言。” 牧师温和地说着，眼泪几乎要从他的脸颊滑落。他很少见到像这两个人这样深爱彼此的人，他们毫不掩饰地展现情感，也开始感动了他自己。

"Shinji," she began as she fought to hold off the sobs that threatened to interrupt her, "I give you this ring as a symbol of my love and faithfulness. As I place it on your finger, I commit my heart and soul to you. I ask you to wear this ring as a reminder of the vows we have spoken today, our wedding day. With this ring, I thee wed." She steadied her hands as she slipped the ring on Shinji's finger. With that simple act, both of their trembling stopped as they drew strength from one another like only a married couple could. The Reverend smiled, knowing that this pairing would last, and knowing that these two would love each other throughout all time, and until the end of the world. Opening his book, he read once more, this time from The Bard, Sonnet 29.  
“真妮，”她开始说，努力抑制住即将打断她的啜泣，“我把这枚戒指送给你，作为我爱你和忠诚的象征。当我把它戴在你的手指上时，我把我的心灵奉献给你。我请求你戴上这枚戒指，作为我们今天所说誓言的提醒，我们的结婚日。有了这枚戒指，我与你结为夫妻。”她稳住手，将戒指戴在真妮的手指上。通过这简单的举动，他们俩的颤抖都停止了，他们像只有已婚夫妻才能做到的那样互相获得了力量。牧师微笑着，知道这对夫妻会长久相伴，知道这两个人会相爱直到世界末日。他翻开书，再次读起，这次是莎士比亚的《第 29 首十四行诗》。

_"When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,  
“当我在厄运和众人眼中受辱时，  
I all alone beweep my outcast state  
我独自为自己的被流放而哭泣  
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries  
用我无用的呼喊惹怒聋的天空  
And look upon myself and curse my fate,  
审视自己并诅咒我的命运,  
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,  
希望自己像那更富有希望的人一样,  
Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd,  
像他一样备受宠爱，像他一样拥有朋友,  
Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,  
渴望这个人的艺术和那个人的广度,  
With what I most enjoy contented least;  
对我最喜欢的东西却感到最不满足;  
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,  
然而在这些想法中，我几乎看不起自己，  
Haply I think on thee, and then my state,  
也许我会想起你，那时我的状态，  
Like to the lark at break of day arising  
就像黎明时分的云雀升起  
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;  
从愁闷的大地上，向天堂之门歌颂赞美;  
For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings"  
因为记得你甜蜜的爱，带来如此丰盛的财富_

"And so dear friends," The Reverend said as the realization finally set in that they were, indeed, married, causing huge grins to spread on Shinji and Asuka's faces, "By the power vested in me by the Creator, the Nation of Japan, and NERV, I hereby declare, for now and all time, you to be husband and wife. And what the Creator has joined this day, let no man, woman, or beast put asunder!" He said that last part as he stared at the back of the chapel again. "Shinji, you may now kiss your bride!" Carefully, Shinji lifted Asuka's veil, revealing her radiant face for him to see.  
“所以亲爱的朋友们，”牧师说道，当他终于意识到他们确实结婚了时，新禧和明日香的脸上露出了灿烂的笑容，“我凭借造物主、日本国和 NERV 赋予我的权力，特此宣布，从今以后，直到永远，你们是夫妻。愿造物主今日所结合的，任何人、任何女人或野兽都不得分开！”他说完最后一句时，再次盯着教堂的后面。 “新禧，你现在可以吻你的新娘了！”小心翼翼地，新禧掀起了明日香的面纱，让他看到她灿烂的脸庞。

"You better get ready and pucker up, Shinji!" She whispered as she jumped into his arms and planted a deep kiss on him, to which he immediately responded. Everyone in the Chapel broke out into laughter as the couple continued to hug and kiss before the assembled crowd. Rev. Knight boomed out in laughter as the rest of the wedding party doubled over with mirth at the spectacle their friends were putting on. Finally, the couple broke their kiss as the Reverend turned the two to face their guests.  
“你最好准备好，准备亲亲了，真嗣！”她轻声说着，跳进他的怀里，在他嘴唇上深深地吻了一下，他立刻回应了。礼堂里的每个人都笑了起来，当这对情侣继续拥抱亲吻时，大家都笑得前仰后合。骑士牧师大声笑着，婚礼派对的其他成员也因为他们的朋友们表演的场面而笑得前俯后仰。最后，当牧师把两人转向他们的客人时，这对情侣结束了他们的亲吻。

"Ladies, gentlemen, boys and girls of all ages! It pleases me to introduce and present to you, Mr. and Mrs. Ikari! Now, let's go party!" he announced as he clasped them both on the shoulder. The music started up once more as Shinji and Asuka walked from the altar arm-in-arm, followed by Kaji and Misato, Touji and Hikari, Kensuke and Rei, Fuyutsuki and Heidi, and then by the rest of the guests as they filed out to the reception in the Grand Hall. The last to leave was Rev. Knight, as he slowly walked toward the back of the Chapel, but not heading immediately for the doors, instead to a darkened corner where he knew someone familiar resided.  
“女士们，先生们，各个年龄段的男孩和女孩们！很高兴向你们介绍，现在向你们呈现，伊卡里先生和夫人！现在，让我们开始派对吧！”他宣布着，一边拍着他们的肩膀。音乐再次响起，真嗣和明日香手挽着手从祭坛走出来，后面跟着卡吉和美里，藤冢和光，健介和丽，冬月和海蒂，然后是其他客人，他们排着队走向大厅的宴会厅。最后离开的是骑士牧师，他慢慢地朝礼堂的后面走去，但并没有立即朝着门走去，而是走向一个黑暗的角落，他知道那里有一个熟悉的人。

"You knew I would be here," the shadow said in a deep voice. It was a statement, not a question.  
“你知道我会在这里的，”阴影用沉重的声音说道。这不是一个问题，而是一个陈述。

"I always know where you are, Commander," The Reverend stated simply as he saw his reflection in the ever-present glasses that were perched on Gendo's face.  
“我总是知道你在哪里，指挥官，”牧师简单地说道，当他看到自己的倒影映在一直戴在 Gendo 脸上的眼镜中时。

"That is highly disconcerting," the elder Ikari replied as he walked from the shadows and stood before the giant of the man. "How is that possible?"  
“这让人感到非常不安，”长者碇回答道，他从阴影中走出来，站在那个巨人面前。“这怎么可能？”

"Heh! I have an 'in' with the Man upstairs," The big man answered back as a smile spread upon his face. "Besides, being your 'advisor' on all things spiritual does have it's advantages at times!" Ikari snorted.  
“呵！我和楼上的大人有着默契，”大个子回答道，脸上露出笑容。“而且，在一切精神事务上充当你的‘顾问’有时候也有它的好处！”伊卡里嗤之以鼻。

"Indeed. Have you been able to complete the translation of the scrolls yet?"  
“确实。你已经完成翻译卷轴的工作了吗？”

"Almost," the Reverend replied, "The text is difficult, but the codes within are relatively simple."  
“差不多了，”牧师回答道，“文本很难，但其中的密码相对简单。”

"Then why is not finished yet?" Ikari asked, some impatience in voice.  
“那为什么还没完成呢？”伊卡里有些不耐烦地问道。

"Translation isn't my only job, Commander," the Reverend said as he turned away from Gendo, "I have been a little busy with other matters, such as your son's wedding. Speaking of which, how did you like it?" He continued toward the doors leading to the Great Hall.  
“翻译并不是我的唯一工作，指挥官，”牧师转身离开源堂，说道，“我还有一些其他事情要忙，比如你儿子的婚礼。说起来，你觉得怎么样？”他继续走向通往大厅的门。

"It was adequate," Gendo answered, a small frown creasing his brow.  
“还算过得去，”根叶回答道，额头微微皱起。

"Ah. I must ask, why didn't you attend the service like everyone else, rather than skulking in the shadows? I know that it would have done Shinji some good to see you amongst the crowd. He had no other members of his family in attendance, other than Lady Ayanami.."  
“啊。我必须问，为什么你不像其他人一样参加仪式，而是潜伏在阴影中？我知道如果你出现在人群中，对真司会有好处。除了绫波夫人，他没有其他家人出席。”

"I'm not sure that The Third Child would consider me family. Most of his surrogate family were in attendance. My appearance would have been an unnecessary distraction." Rev. Knight cocked an eyebrow at that.  
“我不确定第三个孩子会把我视为家人。他的大部分代理家人都出席了。我的出现只会是一个不必要的干扰。” Rev. Knight 对此挑了挑眉。

"As you say, Commander. If you will excuse me, I must put in an appearance at the reception. I trust you will turn down my invitation to attend?" Gendo merely nodded in the affirmative. "I thought as much. A pity, really." With that, the Reverend passed through the doors, leaving Ikari alone with his thoughts. A minute later, he opened his cell phone and dialed in several digits.  
“如您所说，指挥官。如果你不介意，我要去参加招待会了。我相信你会拒绝我的邀请，对吧？” 而碇只是点了点头。 “我就知道。真可惜。” 说完，牧师走过门，留下碇独自思索。一分钟后，他打开手机拨了几个号码。

"Fuyutsuki. I want you to expand the search for the father of the baby to include all of Tokyo-3, as well as everyone in a radius of fifty miles. I want females included in this as well. You never know if we may be able to come up with a familial match. The time for half measures is over!" The Commander said tersely as he concluded his conversation and ended the call. The Second Child was now family, and he refused to allow the culprit to go free any longer than was necessary.  
“冬月。我要你扩大搜索范围，包括第三新东京的所有地方，以及五十英里半径内的所有人。我也希望包括女性在内。谁知道我们是否能找到一个家族匹配呢。现在不是半途而废的时候了！”指挥官说完话，结束了通话。第二个孩子现在是家人了，他拒绝让罪犯比必要的时间更久逍遥法外。

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Yes sir, I understand," Fuyutsuki said as he closed his phone and placed it back within his jacket pocket before he turned back to the toast Kaji was making to Asuka and Shinji. Fuyutsuki was pleased to see how happy the two children were, as well at how much everyone seemed to be enjoying the reception. It had been a very long time since NERV had anything to truly celebrate.  
“是的，长官，我明白了，”冬月说着，关上手机，放回口袋里，然后转身看着卡吉给明日香和真嗣做的烤面包。冬月很高兴看到这两个孩子有多开心，以及每个人似乎都在享受这个招待会。自 NERV 有真正值得庆祝的事情已经很久了。

Shinji and Asuka were lost in each others eyes and paid no attention whatsoever to Kaji, or anyone else for that matter. The dinner progressed rather well until the time came to cut the cake. Asuka shot Touji a dirty look as she saw the cake topper, which showed the groom being dragged by the bride, which brought peals of laughter from the crowd. The villain of that little bit of drama ran for the hills before Hikari could reach out and grab his ear, causing everyone to laugh once more.  
真嗣和明日香沉浸在彼此的眼神中，完全没有注意卡琪，或者其他任何人。晚餐进行得相当顺利，直到切蛋糕的时候。明日香看到蛋糕顶部的装饰，一个新郎被新娘拖着的图案，她瞪了一眼刀二，引来了观众的阵阵笑声。那场小小戏剧的反派在希香伸手去抓他的耳朵之前就跑得没影了，让大家再次笑个不停。

The cake cutting itself went so much better until the bride and groom began to feed each other their cake. Asuka smirked as she smashed the cake into Shinji's face, causing him to snort the cake. Shinji promptly returned the favor by chasing her with a big handful of cake before she finally stopped and stood there to take her punishment. Shinji pulled his hand back like he was going to smash her face really good, then reached out and placed just the smallest dollop of icing on the end of her nose. Opening her eyes, she looked cross-eyed at the frosting, causing Shinji and everyone else to laugh, before Shinji leaned over and kissed it off her nose. The two fell into each others arms as the merriment continued. It was the gift giving that touched everyone's heart.  
蛋糕切割本身进行得很顺利，直到新娘和新郎开始互相喂蛋糕。明日香得意地将蛋糕砸向真嗣的脸，让他不得不喷出蛋糕。真嗣立刻回敬，手里拿着一大把蛋糕追着她，直到她停下来站在那里接受惩罚。真嗣像要狠狠砸她的脸一样把手拉了回来，然后伸手在她的鼻子尖上涂了一小点糖霜。她睁开眼睛，斜视着糖霜，让真嗣和其他人都笑了，然后真嗣俯身亲吻掉她鼻子上的糖霜。两人拥入彼此怀中，欢乐不断。送礼的时刻触动了每个人的心。

They received the typical gifts you would see at weddings, such as blenders, dishes, utensil sets, so on and so forth. Their closer friends did give them things much more personal, like more lingerie for Asuka, or CD gift sets of their favorite singers and composers. Misato gave them a silver picture frame containing a photo of them that was taken right after Shinji had proposed. The look of sheer happiness on both their faces in the picture was enough to melt even the coldest hearts. Kaji gave the happy couple a video camera so they could record the more memorable moments of their lives together. However, when Touji and Kensuke began to snicker, Hikari slapped them both in the back of the head. Shinji's gift to his wife was a custom made silver bracelet that had the word 'love' engraved on it in every language that could fit. It was Asuka's gift to her husband that struck a chord with everyone present.  
他们收到了婚礼上常见的礼物，比如搅拌机、碟子、餐具套装等等。他们更亲近的朋友送给他们更加个性化的礼物，比如给明日香更多的内衣，或者是他们最喜爱歌手和作曲家的 CD 礼盒。美里送给他们一幅银质相框，里面装着一张他们俩刚刚订婚时拍摄的照片。照片中两人脸上流露出的纯真幸福足以融化最冷漠的心。加持送给这对新人一台摄像机，让他们记录下共同生活中更加难忘的时刻。然而，当刀二和健介开始窃笑时，光也狠狠拍了他们后脑勺一下。新吉送给妻子的礼物是一只定制的银质手镯，上面刻着“爱”这个词的各种语言。而明日香送给丈夫的礼物让在场的每个人都感动不已。

"Look over at the band, Shinji," she said sweetly as his head turned to do as she asked. Something looked very odd, as the quintet now had three more places set up. In one chair sat a violin case, in the other chair was a guitar case, and setting up against the last chair was a cello. He looked at Asuka quizzically as she motioned for him to walk over and take a look.  
“看看乐队，真治，”她甜甜地说道，当他转过头照她的要求做时，他发现有些不对劲，五重奏现在多了三个位置。一个椅子上放着一个小提琴盒，另一个椅子上是一个吉他盒，最后一个椅子旁边放着一个大提琴。他疑惑地看着明日香，她示意他走过去看看。

_"She must have gotten me a cello! That must be how she got to know Mr. Takayamagi!"_ he thought as he felt his heart swell even more with love. It made him feel incredible to think that his wife would love him so much to do that for him. As he approached the stage he looked at her.  
“她一定是给我买了一个大提琴！这一定是她认识高山木先生的方式！”他想着，感受到自己的爱更加涌动。想到妻子会如此爱他而为他做这件事，让他感到无比幸福。当他走向舞台时，他看着她。

"Yes, silly! That's yours! Now go check it out!" she beamed as she saw the look on his face. Shinji's grin got even bigger as he closed in on it, as he could tell from this distance that she had gotten him a real top of the line model. It was when he got right up to it that he stopped dead cold.  
“是的，傻瓜！那是你的！快去看看！”她笑容满面地说着，看到他脸上的表情。真治的笑容变得更加灿烂，当他走近时，他就能从这个距离看出她给他买了一把顶级的大提琴。当他走到跟前时，他突然停住了。

"Mother?" he whispered hoarsely as he reached over and studied the cello before him. It was exactly as he remembered, right down to the little scratch Asuka had put on it in the past. He held it lovingly in his hands as he finally saw the very faint lettering on the neck that read 'Yui Ikari'. You had to know it was there to be able to see it. His head spun around and looked at his wife, who stood there with a smile on her face and a tear in her eye. He walked over to her and fell to his knees and wrapped his arms around her waist. "Thank you!" he sobbed as he held her tighter.  
“妈妈？”他嘶哑地低声说着，伸手过去仔细地看着眼前的大提琴。它和他记忆中的一模一样，甚至还有明显的痕迹，正是阿斯卡曾经留下的。他用爱抚着它，最终看到琴颈上极为模糊的字迹，写着“碇由衣”。只有知道才能看到。他的头转向妻子，她站在那里微笑着，眼中含泪。他走过去跪下，将双臂环绕在她腰间。“谢谢！”他抽泣着，更紧紧地拥抱着她。

"You're welcome!" she whispered back with tears in her own eyes as she stroked is hair. "Now, my silly husband, get up there and play me some music!" She sniffled some as he stood and gave her a huge 'thank you' kiss.  
“不客气！”她含泪低声回答，抚摸着他的头发。“现在，我亲爱的丈夫，上去给我弹奏一些音乐吧！”当他站起来给她一个大大的“谢谢”之吻时，她抽泣着。

Slowly, Shinji took his seat and placed the cherished instrument before him, and caressed it's strings like a long lost lover whom he thought he would never see again. He placed one hand over the strings and drew the bow across, brining forth a long, low, warming note. He turned and looked at the other musicians, who nodded for him to begin. Slowly, but with increasing strength, Shinji began to play _Canon in D_ , closing his eyes and allowing himself to fall and drift into the notes as they resonated from the strings he held so carefully in his hands. He felt a rustle of movement around him but ignored it until the time came for the violin to join, which appeared right next to him. He knew that this wasn't right because he had seen the violin player much further back on the stage, but the power and presence of the violin player next to him was so familiar he had to open his eyes.  
慢慢地，真司坐下，将心爱的乐器放在面前，抚摸着它的琴弦，就像是一个久违的恋人，他以为再也见不到了。他用一只手覆盖在琴弦上，拉弓划过，发出一声长而低沉、温暖的音符。他转身看着其他音乐家，他们点头示意他开始。真司开始演奏《D 大调卡农》，慢慢地，但力度逐渐增强，他闭上眼睛，让自己沉浸在琴弦发出的音符中。他感觉到周围有些微动，但直到小提琴加入的时候才注意到，小提琴就在他身旁。他知道这不对，因为他看到小提琴手在舞台后方得多，但站在他身边的小提琴手的力量和存在感是如此熟悉，以至于他不得不睁开眼睛。

Next to him sat his beautiful Asuka, her own eyes closed and flowing with the music as she drew her bow across the strings of her own instrument. She opened her eyes for just a second to glance at him out of the corner of her eye, smiling as she closed them once more. Shinji was about to do the same when he heard the sounds of a very carefully tuned bass guitar begin to play beside him, matching him note for note. He shifted his gaze around and saw Ichigo sitting in the other chair, concentrating on matching him. Shinji smiled, surprised that anyone in that so-called band was able to perform anything close to music. His opinion of the guitar player rose considerably as the piece continued on, never missing a beat or a note as the other instruments continued to join in. When finished, he turned and nodded ever so slightly to Ichigo, who nodded back before placing his guitar down and walking back over to Rei's side. Shinji watched as the young man and his sister stood and talked to each other, and was really surprised to see his sister fawning all over the young bass player. He could see a sparkle in Rei's eyes that he had seen only rarely in the eyes of others, and he felt happy and worried at the same time. However, a warm touch to his arm drew his attention away from Rei and her beau.  
他身旁坐着他美丽的明日香，她闭上了自己的眼睛，随着音乐流淌，拉动着自己乐器的琴弓。她只是瞥了他一眼，微微一笑，然后又闭上了眼睛。当真正开始演奏时，他听到了一把非常精心调音的低音吉他的声音，与他的音符完美契合。他转过头去，看到另一把椅子上坐着一名名叫一诚的人，专心致志地与他协调演奏。他惊讶地微笑，意识到那所谓的乐队中竟然有人能演奏出近乎完美的音乐。当乐曲结束时，他微微点头示意一诚，一诚也回以微微点头，然后放下吉他走回到了零的身边。他看着这个年轻人和他的姐姐站起来互相交谈，真的很惊讶地看到他的姐姐对这位年轻的低音吉他手倾心。 他看到了 Rei 眼中的一抹闪光，这种闪光他只在少数人眼中见过，他感到既开心又担忧。然而，一只温暖的手碰到他的胳膊，将他的注意力从 Rei 和她的情人身上转移开来。

"Whatcha thinking about?" Asuka wondered, a small smirk on her face. Shinji grinned as he replied.  
“你在想什么呢？”明日香好奇地问道，脸上挂着一丝微笑。新吉报以微笑回答。

"I'm thinking about how I'm the luckiest guy on Earth!" Asuka's eyes narrowed just a bit as she answered.  
“我在想我是地球上最幸运的人！”明日香微微眯起眼睛回答道。

"Good answer! You are, however, such a lousy liar! Now, tell me what you really were thinking!" Shinji blushed a bit, knowing that he had been caught flatfooted.  
“答得不错！不过，你真是个糟糕的说谎者！现在告诉我，你真正在想什么！”新吉有点脸红，知道自己被抓个正着。

"I'm just hoping that we don't have to plan another wedding very soon. I guess we need to have a talk with Rei." Asuka patted his hand before grabbing him up and dragging him to the dance floor.  
“我只是希望我们不用很快再筹划另一场婚礼。我想我们需要和丽谈谈。”明日香拍了拍他的手，然后拉着他去舞池。

"Rei can take care of herself, so stop being a worry wart! Now, come on! I wanna dance with my husband!" With that, they reached the dance floor as the band started back up, and Shinji and Asuka enjoyed their first dance as a married couple. When the first song ended, other couples soon joined them on the dance floor. The first ones up were Rei and her date, much to everyone's surprised, followed closely by Kaji and Misato, Touji and Hikari, and Heidi and the Reverend. The festivities continued on for quite some time until Asuka started getting a little tired, which began to worry Shinji.  
“丽可以照顾自己，别老是杞人忧天！来吧！我想和我的丈夫跳支舞！”说着，他们走到了舞池，乐队重新开始演奏，新吉和明日香享受着他们作为夫妻的第一支舞。第一支歌曲结束后，其他情侣很快加入了他们在舞池中。首先上来的是丽和她的约会对象，让所有人都感到惊讶，紧随其后的是加持和美里，藤吉和光，海蒂和牧师。欢庆活动持续了相当长一段时间，直到明日香开始有点累，这让新吉开始担心起来。

"It's nothing to worry about, your daughter is just wanting to take a nap, that's all," Asuka replied as Shinji and the others made to wrap up the reception.  
“没什么好担心的，你女儿只是想睡个觉，仅此而已，”明日香在新垣和其他人准备结束招待会时回答道。

The first order of business was the Tossing of the Bridal Bouquet. The crowd of single females that had gathered upon the dance floor was like nothing anyone had ever seen before, as they all jostled for position to catch the magical flowers. Asuka grinned as she saw her bridesmaids manage to get spots close to the front of the crowd. Turning her back to the ladies, she stared straight at Shinji , who was leaned up against the wall with his arms crossed, surrounded by his groomsmen. Giving him a wink and a nod, she started to angle herself just so, until a slight shake of Shinji's head made her stop. She angled back a little until he nodded slightly and flashed her a wide grin, which she gladly returned. This exchange did not go unnoticed by Kaji as the redheaded German closed her eyes and tossed the bouquet in a wide arc over her head.  
首要任务是抛撒新娘捧花。聚集在舞池上的单身女性群像是前所未见的，她们争先恐后地争夺那些神奇的花朵。明日香看着自己的伴娘们设法站到了人群前排，她笑得合不拢嘴。她背对着女士们，直勾勾地盯着站在墙边双臂交叉的新垣，他被他的伴郎们围绕着。她对他眨了眨眼，点了点头，开始微微调整自己的姿势，直到新垣微微摇头示意她停下。她稍微调整了一下，直到他微微点头并露出灿烂笑容，她也乐意回应。这一幕并未逃过卡琪的眼睛，这位红发的德国人闭上眼睛，将捧花高高抛过头顶。

As the crowd of women started to push and dive for the bouquet, a rather startled Misato stood her ground as the pale pink and white flowers seemed to making a beeline straight for her. Frozen like a deer in headlights, she merely stood as the blessed bundle continued to float in slow-motion before landing in her outstretched hands. She looked at it like it was a visitor from outer space that had just taken a dump in her hands, before the shock wore off and she grinned like a madwoman, waving the bouquet at Kaji, who stood his ground and giggled his head off. Misato blushed and began to giggle as well.  
当一群女人开始推搡争抢花束时，一位有些惊讶的美里站稳了脚跟，淡粉色和白色的花似乎直奔她而来。她像是被车灯照到的鹿一样呆住了，只是站在那里，幸运的花束继续缓慢漂浮，最终落入她伸出的手中。她看着它，就像是外太空的访客刚在她手上拉了一泡屎一样，然后震惊消退，她像个疯女人一样咧嘴笑了起来，挥舞着花束朝着加持，后者站在原地哈哈大笑。美里脸红了，也开始咯咯笑了起来。

"You two did that on purpose, didn't you?" Kaji accused jokingly , as he wagged a finger at the young Ikari, who refused to look at him.  
“你们两个故意的，对吧？”卡琪开玩笑地指责道，他摇着手指指着年轻的碇，后者却拒绝看他。

"Who, us?" Shinji answered innocently, refusing to look Kaji in the eye for fear of losing his composure and laughing in the older man's face.  
“我们？谁啊？”新吉天无辜地回答，拒绝看卡琪的眼睛，唯恐失态笑出声来。

"Yeah, you!" Kaji continued, still waiting for an answer as he grinned his lopsided grin. Shinji glanced at him out of the corner of his eye and noticed that Kaji's tie and collar had mysteriously been loosened. Kaji was back to normal.  
“对，就是你！”卡琪继续说着，依然等待着回答，咧嘴一笑。新吉斜眼看着他，注意到卡琪的领带和衣领神奇地松开了。卡琪恢复了正常。

"Yup!" Shinji replied with a grin as he and the others began to move to the floor. All the single guys there were reluctantly dragged or thrown to the dance floor by their dates or their friends. They all knew what was coming and most of them wanted to have no part of it, and wished to avoid it like the Plague.  
“是的！”新吉笑着回答，他和其他人开始走向舞池。那里所有单身男士都被他们的约会对象或朋友勉强拉到舞池，或者被扔进去。他们都知道接下来会发生什么，大多数人都不想参与，希望像躲避瘟疫一样避开。

A chair was brought to the middle of the floor next to where Shinji and Asuka stood. Shinji lead his wife to the chair with every intention of having her sit in it, but Asuka had other plans. Wiggling her eyebrow at him, Asuka raised the hem of her dress just a tad and placed her foot on it. Shinji blushed as Asuka began to slowly pull the dress up her leg, revealing the open-toed, ankle-strap high heels and white stockings she was wearing. Now, all the guys in the crowd were very interested in what was going on, but much to their disappointment, she stopped at the knee.  
一把椅子被搬到了舞池中央，就在新吉和明日香站立的地方。新吉牵着妻子走向椅子，本意是让她坐下，但明日香有其他打算。明日香挑了挑眉，微微提起裙摆，把脚放在上面。新吉脸红了，明日香开始慢慢地提起裙子，露出了露脚趾、脚踝绑带高跟鞋和白色长筒袜。现在，人群中的所有男士都对发生的事情非常感兴趣，但令他们失望的是，她在膝盖处停了下来。

"Okay, silly, the rest is up to you," she smiled wickedly as Shinji's grin matched hers. Knowing just what to do to drive Asuka wild, he gently placed his fingertips on her stocking clad ankle and slowly worked his way up to the hem of her dress. Asuka flushed somewhat as the sensation on his fingers on her legs sent waves of warmth all through her body. She didn't want him to stop, but she was hoping that he would hurry up and finish before anyone could notice her condition. Her breathing began to become rather ragged as Shinji continued to slide his fingers up her leg while raising the dress even more to gain access to the garter hidden within. It was up higher on her thigh than he had thought it would be, and his own breathing became labored as he felt the top of her stockings along with the clasp of her garter belt. His eyes widened as he looked up into her eyes and saw the sultry look in her eye.  
“好了，傻瓜，剩下的就靠你了，”她邪恶地笑着，新吉的笑容与她相匹配。他清楚地知道如何让明日香兴奋，轻轻地把指尖放在她穿着长筒袜的脚踝上，慢慢地沿着裙摆往上移动。明日香有些脸红，因为他的手指在她的腿上带来的感觉让她全身都充满了温暖。她不想让他停下来，但她希望他能赶快结束，免得别人注意到她的状态。当新吉继续沿着她的腿滑动手指，同时把裙子提得更高以便接触到隐藏在里面的吊袜带时，她开始有些喘不过气来。吊袜带比他想象中的更高，他感到自己的呼吸急促起来，感受到了她长筒袜的顶端以及吊袜带的扣环。他睁大眼睛抬头看着她的眼睛，看到了她眼中的妩媚神情。

"Well, it is called a garter, after all," she smirked, as Shinji began to slide the mentioned item down her leg. He heard the moans of disappointment as the hem of her dress slid back down her leg, but ignored them as he concentrated on the purring he heard from Asuka as he continued to caress her leg as he drew the garter down. He removed the garter and allowed Asuka to take her leg off the chair and stand beside him as he got ready to do his duty.  
“嘿，毕竟它叫做吊袜带嘛，”她咧嘴一笑，当新吉开始把提到的物品从她的腿上滑下时。他听到她的裙摆重新滑下腿部时发出的失望的呻吟声，但他无视了，专注于阿斯卡从她的腿上传来的呼噜声，他继续抚摸她的腿，将吊袜带拉下。他取下吊袜带，让阿斯卡把腿从椅子上抬起，站在他身边，准备做他的职责。

"You are so going to pay for that later," she murmured in his ear as her breath tickled his neck and sent waves of pleasure down his spine. He turned to her and grinned savagely before placing a kiss on her lips.  
“你等着晚上会为此付出代价的，”她在他耳边低语，她的呼吸刺激着他的脖子，让快感从他的脊椎传来。他转身看着她，狞笑着，在她的嘴唇上落下一吻。

"Oh, I hope so!" he chuckled as he turned his attention back to the crowd of men before him. Shinji's eyes narrowed as he locked on to the agreed target and placed the garter on the index finger of his left hand and pulled it back like a slingshot with his right. As if on cue, all the men on the floor, save one, scattered to the Four Winds, looking for all intents and purposes like roaches scurrying from the light. The lone survivor had no knowledge of this, since he had been shoved to the front of the crowd by those desperate to escape. Shinji loosed his weapon and allowed Destiny to take charge over it's flight.  
“希望如此！”他笑着说，然后把注意力转回面前的一群男人。当真司锁定约定的目标，用左手食指戴上吊袜带，用右手拉后，眼睛眯了起来。就像按照计划一样，除了一个人，地板上的所有男人都四处逃窜，看起来就像是蟑螂在灯光下乱窜。唯一幸存者并不知情，因为他被那些急于逃跑的人推到人群前面。真司放开武器，让命运掌控它的飞行路线。

WHAP! The lacey blue garter caught Kaji right between the eyes before falling and landing in his hands. He glanced down at the object that had assaulted him, stunned, before he heard the applause and looked around. He was startled to see that he was the only one on the floor, save the happy couple. Kaji blushed somewhat, but hid it well as Misato rushed the floor, leapt into his arms, and covered his face in kisses. Asuka and Shinji continued to laugh before they, too, took each other in their arms and kissed before a stunned but happy crowd.  
啪！蓝色蕾丝吊袜带正中加持的额头，然后掉落在他手中。他惊讶地看着攻击他的物体，然后听到掌声，四处张望。他吃惊地发现自己是唯一一个站在地板上的人，除了新婚夫妇。加持有些脸红，但掩饰得很好，当美里冲上舞池，扑进他的怀里，亲吻他的脸庞时。明日香和真司继续笑着，然后他们也相拥亲吻，让一群惊讶但快乐的人围观。

The bridesmaids and groomsmen gathered up all of the wedding gifts, cards, cake top, and such for Asuka and Shinji as the happy couple got ready to leave the reception. They had already made plans to head back to their apartment and change and clean up before heading to the airport to begin their honeymoon. Misato reassured them that they would take care of everything, and began to cry as she watched her two charges walk arm-in-arm to the doors of the Great Hall. Heidi soon joined her in the cry, as she watched her niece and a young man she had come to love as a member of her family get ready to leave to start their life together. Rei and Hikari came over to comfort them, but the tears were contagious, as the two younger ladies began to bawl as well. They walked over and hugged Asuka and Shinji, causing the young redhead to breakdown, too.  
当新娘伴娘和新郎伴郎们收拾好所有的婚礼礼物、卡片、蛋糕顶部等等，准备离开接待会时，阿斯卡和真司这对新婚夫妇已经计划好回公寓换衣服、整理一下，然后前往机场开始他们的蜜月之旅。美里安慰他们说会照顾一切，当她看着自己的两个扶养对象手挽手走向大厅门口时，她开始哭泣。海蒂很快也加入了哭泣的行列，她看着自己的侄女和一个她视为家人的年轻男子准备离开开始他们的生活。丽和光也走过来安慰她们，但眼泪是会传染的，两位年轻女士也开始放声大哭。她们走过去拥抱阿斯卡和真司，导致这位年轻的红发女孩也崩溃了。

"You two be careful, okay?" Misato sobbed as she clung to Shinji, wetting his jacket with he tears. He patted her pack as he tried to reassure her.  
“你们要小心，好吗？”美里抽泣着紧紧抱住真司，用泪水打湿了他的夹克。他拍拍她的背，试图安慰她。

"We will, Misato, we will!" he replied as he glanced over to his wife, who was doing the same for Heidi.  
“我们会的，美里，我们会的！”他回答道，同时看向他的妻子，她也在为海蒂做着同样的事情。

"Despite how tough she claims to be, she's still in a delicate condition! Please take care of her!" Misato continued as she looked Shinji in the eye, who didn't flinch from her gaze.  
“尽管她声称自己很坚强，但她还是处于一个脆弱的状态！请好好照顾她！”美里继续说着，目不转睛地看着不畏惧她目光的真司。

"I'd lay my life down for her, Misato! You know I would!"  
“为她我可以赴汤蹈火，美里！你知道的！”

"I know, I know! But this is really hard, Shinji! It's like watching two of my own kids leaving, you know?" Misato continued to sob as Kaji came up and took her off Shinji's hands.  
“我知道，我知道！但这真的很难，真司！就像看着我自己的两个孩子离开一样，你知道吗？”美里继续抽泣着，卡吉走上前来，把她从真司手中接过。

"I know, Misato, but I promise we'll be okay!" he insisted as he gathered Asuka up and began to head out the door, only to be stopped suddenly by a giant leaning on a sword. A claymore, to be exact.  
“我知道，美里，但我保证我们会没事的！”他坚持着把明日香抱起来，准备走出门，却突然被一个靠在剑上的巨人挡住了去路。确切地说，是一把大剑。

"Hold, Lord and Lady Ikari!" The Reverend said as he stood before the young couple, blocking their passage out. Asuka shot Shinji a withering glance as she saw what the Reverend held.  
“等一下，伊卡里大人和夫人！”牧师站在年轻夫妇面前，挡住了他们的去路。明日香看到牧师手里拿着什么时，对真嗣投去了一个冷冷的眼神。

"I thought you said he didn't have a sword!" she whispered fiercely.  
“你不是说他没有剑吗！”她激烈地低声说道。

"He didn't! Not earlier, at least!" Shinji whispered back, trying to figure out what was going on. "What's up, Reverend?" The Reverend grinned as he stepped aside.  
“他没有！至少之前没有！” 真嗣低声回答，试图弄清楚发生了什么。“怎么了，牧师？” 牧师笑着让开了一边。

"Not a thing, milord! I was merely giving your honor guard a moment to finish setting up!" Asuka and Shinji stood there, looking confused.  
“没什么，大人！我只是让你的荣卫有个完成布置的时刻！” 明日香和真嗣站在那里，一脸困惑。

"Honor Guard?" the couple asked in unison. The Reverend laughed deeply as he moved and allowed them to step out of the Hall. The sight before them surprised them quite a bit. A line of one hundred military personnel, all dressed in Class A's and wielding a sword, stood at attention along the path to the limo.  
“荣卫？” 这对夫妇异口同声地问道。 牧师深深地笑了笑，然后移开让他们走出大厅。他们眼前的景象让他们感到非常惊讶。一百名身穿 A 类军服、手持剑的军人整齐列队，沿着通往豪华轿车的道路肃立。

"Guard! Present arms!" the Reverend bellowed as one hundred swords were drawn and placed before the faces of their owners.  
“护卫！举枪！”牧师咆哮着，一百把剑被抽出来，放在主人面前。

"Guard! Order arms!" the minister bellowed once more as one hundred swords formed a crossed arch for the couple to pass under. With a slap on their rear ends by the Reverend's claymore, Asuka and Shinji began to run down the red carpet that had been laid out before them. Just before they got to the end, the last two swords fell and crossed before them, stopping their progress.  
“护卫！收枪！”牧师再次咆哮着，一百把剑形成一个十字拱门，让新人通过。在牧师的大刀拍打在他们的屁股后，明日香和真嗣开始沿着铺在红地毯上的路跑。就在他们快到终点时，最后两把剑掉落在他们面前，阻止了他们的前进。

"On behalf of the Berserkers, the Spartans, the Furies, and the Corsairs, we just want to say 'Congratulations', and we're looking forward to working with you both!" a large man said as he and his counterpart raised their swords and allowed Asuka and Shinji to proceed and enter the limo. The young couple only had eyes for each other as the limo pulled away from the curb and began to take them on the journey of their young lives.  
“代表狂战士、斯巴达人、弗里斯和海盗，我们只想说‘恭喜’，我们期待与你们合作！”一个魁梧的男人说着，他和他的同伴举起剑，让明日香和真嗣继续前行，进入豪华轿车。年轻的情侣只有彼此在眼中，当轿车离开路边，开始带他们踏上他们年轻生活的旅程。

### Chapter 8
The air was still cool as a breeze blew in from the sea, causing the young redhead to shiver slightly. Asuka stood on the balcony and unconsciously hugged herself to keep warm as she watched the sun slowly rise above the sea dominated horizon. A gentle smile crossed her lips.  
海风从海上吹来，空气依然凉爽，使得年轻的红发女孩微微颤抖。明日香站在阳台上，无意识地抱紧自己以保暖，同时注视着太阳缓缓升起，照亮了海天一色的地平线。她的嘴角浮现出一丝温柔的微笑。

She felt _happy_. Genuinely happy and content for the first time in a very, very long time. She looked down and placed a hand on her slowly growing belly as the ocean breeze gently stirred her long, unbound locks. Asuka rubbed her belly and hummed ever so softly as she picture the little one that was growing within her. Letting out a happy little sigh, she turned her head and watched her husband as he continued to sleep peacefully with a silly little smile on his face. A blush lit up her cheeks as she remembered the previous night.  
她感到快乐。真正地快乐和满足，这是很久很久以来的第一次。她低头，将手放在渐渐隆起的腹部，任由海风轻轻吹动她那未束的长发。明日香轻抚着肚子，低声哼唱，想象着正在她体内成长的小生命。她发出一声幸福的轻叹，转头看着丈夫，他正带着傻乎乎的微笑安详地睡着。回想起昨晚，她的脸颊泛起了红晕。

Shinji was so much…_more_…than she had ever thought he would be, and not necessarily in the physical sense. Asuka knew him to be a kind and loyal friend, a loving boyfriend and now spouse, and a fierce warrior. However, until last night, she never knew he would be such a gentle lover. One of the things she learned last night, much to her utmost delight, was that her fulfillment was his top priority. When she had asked him about it, he smiled and told her that making sure she was satisfied was half of his fun.  
真嗣比她曾经想象的要...多得多...不仅仅是在身体层面。明日香知道他是一个善良而忠诚的朋友，一个充满爱意的男友和现在的伴侣，以及一个勇猛的战士。然而，直到昨晚，她才意识到他会是一个如此温柔的情人。她昨晚学到的一件事，令她无比欣喜的是，她的满足感是他的首要任务。当她向他询问此事时，他微笑着告诉她，确保她满意是他乐趣的一半。

Shinji had done his job well. She had certainly been satisfied, quite a few times in fact. That was one thing Asuka had always feared when it came to thoughts of taking a lover or a getting married. She had been told by many people that men only looked out for themselves, that they would use her and then toss her aside like a piece of garbage. But for some reason, she knew Shinji would never be that way, and she was very happy to discover that she had been right.  
真嗣做得很好。她确实感到满足，事实上不止一次。每当想到拥有情人或结婚时，明日香总有一件事担心。许多人告诉她，男人只关心自己，他们会利用她，然后像扔垃圾一样抛弃她。但不知为何，她知道真嗣绝不会那样，而她很高兴发现自己的直觉是正确的。

It had been awkward at first, as was to be expected. Despite the fact that they had known each other for several years and had been with each other constantly for months, the shock of actually seeing each other fully for the first time had led to some serious blushing. Asuka's old reflexes began to come into play until Shinji took her hand and took the lead. Ever since they had actually gotten together as a couple, Shinji had discovered how to get Asuka to relax, as well as how to enflame her desires. A soft caress, a light touch, a gentle kiss and she was putty in his hands. To top it off, whenever he stared into her bright blue eyes, she would melt like a popsicle on a hot sidewalk in summer. She would never admit that to anyone, of course, except Shinji.  
起初确实有些尴尬，这也在意料之中。尽管他们相识多年，几个月来也一直形影不离，但真正第一次完全面对彼此时，那份震惊还是让他们脸红不已。直到真嗣握住明日香的手，主动引导，明日香才逐渐找回往日的反应。自从他们真正成为一对恋人后，真嗣学会了如何让明日香放松，也懂得了如何点燃她的欲望。轻柔的爱抚、微妙的触碰、温柔的亲吻，便足以让她在他手中化作一滩柔情。更妙的是，每当他凝视她那双明亮的蓝眼睛时，她便如同夏日炎炎下人行道上的冰棍般融化。当然，她绝不会向任何人承认这一点，除了真嗣。

After they relaxed, and after a serious case of the giggles, they allowed Nature to take it's course. Asuka reminded herself to thank Nature, as well as Misato, Kaji, and even the two Stooges. She knew that there was no way in the world her Shinji could have come up with some of the stuff he had done last night on his own. She began to blush again as she wrapped her thin robe tighter around herself in an effort to keep warm. The thin robe and the even thinner teddy she was wearing may send Shinji's heart all aflutter, but it did nothing to keep her warm on the balcony. Asuka was ready to turn and go back inside when she felt a pair of arms encircle her waist, as soft kisses were placed on her neck.  
他们放松下来，一阵大笑之后，任由自然发展。明日香提醒自己要感谢大自然，还有美里、加持，甚至那两个傻瓜。她知道，世界上没有任何办法能让她的真嗣独自想出昨晚他做的那些事情。她再次脸红，紧紧裹住自己单薄的睡袍以保暖。这件薄薄的睡袍和她身上更薄的睡衣可能让真嗣心跳加速，但在阳台上却丝毫不能让她感到温暖。明日香正准备转身回屋，却感觉到一双臂膀环住了她的腰，温柔的吻落在她的脖颈上。

"Morning," she purred as she melted back into the arms of her husband. Shinji continued to nibble on her neck, causing Asuka to become quite…warm.  
“早上好。”她娇声说道，身体向后融化进丈夫的怀抱。真嗣继续轻咬她的脖子，让明日香感到相当……温暖。

"Morning," he whispered back into her ear as he held her close. "How are my ladies doing today?" Asuka grinned as she rubbed her belly and then felt him do the same. "It's a little chilly out here."  
“早上好。”他在她耳边低语，紧紧拥抱着她。“我的女士们今天怎么样？”明日香笑着抚摸自己的肚子，然后感觉到他也做了同样的动作。“这里有点冷。”

"We're both doing good, thank you!" Asuka replied as she turned to face her husband. "And I'm perfectly comfortable, now!" She looked up at him and then reached up and gave him a huge 'good morning' kiss. Shinji was cross-eyed when she finished with him.  
"我们都很好，谢谢！" 明日香回答道，同时转身面对她的丈夫。"我现在非常舒服！" 她抬头看着他，然后伸手给了他一个热情的"早上好"吻。明日香结束时，真嗣被吻得眼珠都快翻出来了。

"Wow! So…whatcha doing?" Shinji asked as he tried to catch his breath. Asuka giggled at his reaction.  
"哇！那么……你在做什么呢？" 真嗣喘着气问道。明日香被他的反应逗得咯咯笑。

"Well, if you must know, my silly Shinji, I was just watching the sunrise. And thinking," the redhead replied. Her husband smirked slightly.  
"好吧，如果你非要知道的话，我亲爱的真嗣，我只是在看日出。还有思考，" 红发女孩回答道。她的丈夫微微一笑。

"About what? What you want for breakfast? Where you're wanting to go today?" he asked as he inhaled the scent of strawberries that always seemed to linger in her hair.  
"在想什么？早餐想吃什么？今天想去哪里？" 他问道，同时深吸了一口她头发上总是萦绕的草莓香味。

"No, you idiot! About last night!" she replied with a sultry grin, causing Shinji to blush. She giggled again as she saw the red rise to his cheeks. Asuka always thought that it was so cute to see him blush, which is why she used to tease him so much when they were younger. Well, one reason, anyway. "About other stuff, too."  
“不，你这个傻瓜！关于昨晚的事！”她带着挑逗的笑容回答，让真嗣脸红了。看到他的脸颊泛红，她又咯咯笑了起来。明日香一直觉得看他脸红很可爱，这也是为什么他们年轻时她总爱捉弄他的原因之一。“还有其他的事。”

"Like?" he encouraged her. Shinji knew that something was troubling his love.  
“比如？”他鼓励她说出来。真嗣知道有什么事情困扰着他的爱人。

"Why did we wait so long, Shinji? Why did we deny what we felt? Why did we fail to act?" the crimson-haired mother-to-be asked as her eyes clouded somewhat. Shinji sighed as he pulled her close.  
“为什么我们等了这么久，真嗣？为什么我们否认自己的感情？为什么我们没有采取行动？”这位红发准妈妈问道，眼神有些阴郁。真嗣叹了口气，将她紧紧抱住。

"We were too scared, I guess," he replied as he tried to sooth his wife. "You had your reasons, and I was too big of a coward to act…OOF!" he exclaimed as Asuka punched him in the stomach.  
“我想，我们太害怕了，”他回答，试图安抚他的妻子。“你有你的理由，而我太懦弱，不敢行动……哎哟！”明日香一拳打在他的肚子上，他痛呼出声。

"You're not a coward!" Asuka growled as the fire returned, "Anyone who could leap into an EVA and do what you do can never be called a coward! You were just scared, that's natural! There's a big difference between being scared and being a coward! I was wrong to call you that in the past, I know that now. I'm sorry."  
“你不是懦夫！”明日香咆哮着，火焰再次燃起，“任何能跳进 EVA 并做你所做之事的人，绝不能被称为懦夫！你只是害怕，这是自然的！害怕和懦夫之间有着巨大的差别！我过去那样说你是不对的，我现在明白了。对不起。”

"That hurt!" he complained as he rubbed his stomach. Asuka smiled sweetly as she replied.  
“那很痛！”他抱怨着揉了揉肚子。明日香甜甜地笑着回答。

"It's supposed to! Don't think that just because we're married now that I won't knock the snot out of you if you do or say something really stupid, like putting yourself down! Understand me, Third Child?" she said as she waved a fist at him.  
“就是要让你痛！别以为我们现在结婚了，我就会在你做或说些真正愚蠢的事，比如贬低自己时，不把你打得满地找牙！明白吗，第三适格者？”她说着向他挥了挥拳头。

"Yes ma'am, Mrs. Third Child!" Shinji replied cheekily as he pinched her butt and ran back into the room as fast as he could.  
“是的，夫人，第三适格者太太！”真嗣俏皮地回答，捏了一下她的屁股，然后飞快地跑回房间。

"_Ach, nein!_ I've been demoted!" Asuka exclaimed as she took off after her husband, her thin robe flapping in the breeze. "Shinji Ikari! Get your ass back here!" she laughed as she ran back into their suite.  
“啊，不！我被降职了！”明日香边喊边追着她的丈夫，薄薄的睡袍在风中飘动。“碇真嗣！给我回来！”她笑着跑回他们的套房。

_Summer, 2016 2016 年夏天_

"I'm coming!" Shinji called out as he rose from the couch to answer the door. Whomever was doing the knocking, they were quite persistent as the knocking continued until Shinji was finally able to open the door. What he saw, floored him.  
“来了！”真嗣从沙发上起身去开门。无论敲门的是谁，都相当坚持，敲门声一直持续到真嗣终于能够打开门。他看到的景象让他惊呆了。

"_Guten tag_!" the stranger called out as Shinji stood there and did his best impersonation of a fish out of water. "Is this the home of Asuka Langley Soryu?"  
“你好！”陌生人喊道，而真嗣站在那里，尽力模仿着一条离开水的鱼。“这里是惣流·明日香·兰格雷的家吗？”

"Uh, y-yes ma'am," the pilot of Unit One stammered in reply as he continued to star at the newcomer. Despite the fact she was a little older looking and a bit more… _well endowed_…Shinji could have sworn he was looking at a twin of his room mate.  
“呃，是-是的，女士，”一号机的飞行员结结巴巴地回答，目光依旧停留在新来者身上。尽管她看起来年纪稍长，身材也更为…丰满…但真嗣几乎可以发誓，他看到的是自己室友的双胞胎。

"_Sehr gute_! I am Captain Heidi Zeppelin of NERV Security, Third Branch. Is Asuka home?" she asked the stunned young man, who could do nothing but stand and stare.  
“非常好！我是 NERV 安全部第三分部的海蒂·齐柏林上尉。明日香在家吗？”她向那位目瞪口呆的年轻人问道，后者除了站着发呆什么也做不了。

"Uh, no ma'am. She's at a friend's house for the day," Shinji replied, still stunned and blocking the doorway. Heidi smirked a little at the expression on the Third Child's face.  
“呃，不在，女士。她今天去朋友家了，”真嗣回答道，仍然处于震惊之中，挡在门口。海蒂对第三适格者脸上的表情略带嘲讽地笑了笑。

"What's wrong? You keep staring at me! Do I have a booger on my nose, or are you just stunned by my radiant beauty?" she asked with a grin on her face as she thrust her chest out, watching Shinji's cheeks turn redder than a beet at the remark. Despite the fact she was dressed in a NERV Security black uniform, her attributes were impressive and could easily rival Misato's. _"Asuka wasn't kidding when she said he was so cute when he blushes!"_ she thought.  
“怎么了？你一直盯着我看！我鼻子上是不是有鼻屎，还是你被我的绝世美貌惊呆了？”她笑着问道，挺起胸膛，看着真嗣的脸颊因这番话变得比甜菜还要红。尽管她穿着 NERV 安全部的黑色制服，她的身材特征却十分引人注目，甚至能与美里相媲美。“明日香没说错，他脸红的样子真是太可爱了！”她心想。

"Er, yes…I mean no!…uh…what I mean is…oh man…" he stammered as the redhead before him began to laugh.  
“呃，是的…我是说不是！…呃…我的意思是…哦，天哪…”他结结巴巴地说，面前的红发女孩开始笑了起来。

"Asuka's right! You are fun to tease!" Heidi said between giggles, then felt a little bad as Shinji's face fell and he began to stare at the floor.  
“明日香说得对！你真好玩弄！”海蒂笑着说，然后看到真嗣的脸色一沉，开始盯着地板，她感到有些内疚。

"I'm sorry," he muttered as Heidi gently reached out and lifted his chin so she could look into his steel blue eyes.  
“对不起，”他喃喃道，海蒂温柔地伸出手抬起他的下巴，以便能凝视他那钢铁般的蓝色眼睛。

"No, no, I'm the one who's sorry! I'm Asuka's aunt, and I'm guessing that you're Shinji Ikari. Asuka told me so much about you that I felt like I already knew you. You wrote to me about Asuka, remember?" Heidi reassured him as she watched him relax. "May I come in?"  
“不，不，该道歉的是我！我是明日香的阿姨，我猜你就是真嗣·碇。明日香跟我讲了那么多关于你的事，我感觉我已经认识你了。你给我写过关于明日香的信，记得吗？”海蒂安慰他，看着他放松下来。“我可以进来吗？”

"Huh? Oh! I'm sorry, please come in," Shinji replied, feeling extremely embarrassed by his lack of manners. Moving aside, he allowed Heidi to enter and then led her to the living room. After fixing some tea, Shinji had time to sufficiently relax enough for the two of them to have a nice conversation as the time quickly passed.  
"嗯？哦！对不起，请进，" 真嗣回答道，对自己的失礼感到非常尴尬。他侧身让开，让海蒂进来，然后带她到客厅。准备好茶后，真嗣有时间充分放松，两人愉快地交谈着，时间很快就过去了。

"You know something, Shinji? You really do take after your mother," Heidi said as she sat back and sipped her tea. The young man's jaw dropped slightly before replying.  
"你知道吗，真嗣？你真的很像你妈妈，" 海蒂坐回椅子，啜饮着茶说道。年轻人的下巴微微张开，然后回答。

"You knew my mother, Captain?" he asked hopefully. Heidi's eyes twinkled as she studied the young man. She could see the longing in his eyes and hear the hope in his voice.  
"你认识我妈妈，队长？" 他满怀希望地问道。海蒂的眼睛闪烁着，仔细打量着年轻人。她能看到他眼中的渴望，听到他声音中的希望。

"Please, call me 'Heidi'. Yes, I knew your mother, Shinji. She and my sister, Kyoko, would sit around for hours and talk about the more technical aspects of Project E, which was truly over my pretty head! My specialty is security and psychology, but they would include me in their conversations from time to time. They wondered about what the psychological responses of the pilots would be like after synching up with a life form such as the EVAs, or even about the psychological responses of the EVAs themselves. I helped them as best as I could, but I reminded them that there were many better qualified people they could ask. They would smile at me and tell me that although that was true, there was only one they could trust." Heidi recalled as her eyes grew distant, with just a hint of moisture detectable. Shinji sat there, riveted by the NERV captain.  
"请叫我'海蒂'。是的，我认识你母亲，真嗣。她和我的妹妹，恭子，会坐在一起好几个小时，讨论 E 计划的技术细节，那些对我来说真是太高深了！我的专长是安全和心理学，但她们偶尔也会让我参与她们的对话。她们会思考，在同步与 EVA 这样的生命体后，驾驶员的心理反应会是什么样的，甚至 EVA 自身的心理反应。我尽我所能帮助她们，但我提醒她们，有很多更专业的人士可以请教。她们会对我微笑，告诉我尽管如此，但她们只信任一个人。" 海蒂回忆道，她的眼神变得遥远，眼角隐约闪烁着泪光。真嗣坐在那里，被 NERV 的队长深深吸引。

"Kyoko? Why does that name sound familiar?" Shinji pondered as Heidi continued to watch him, her mind trying to evaluated the condition of her friend's son. "She was your sister, which makes her…"  
恭子？为什么这个名字听起来这么熟悉？" 真嗣思索着，而海蒂继续注视着他，心里试图评估她朋友儿子的状况。"她是你的妹妹，这意味着她……

"Asuka's mother," Heidi finished his statement for him. Shinji was flabbergasted to think that he and Asuka's mothers knew each other. Heidi smiled as she continued on with her story, " They were good friends, that's one thing I can tell you. We did a lot of things together: talking, shopping, stuff like that. When Yui became pregnant with you, we were all so thrill, even your father. Kyoko was so happy, she was beside herself!" Heidi looked at Shinji with narrowed eyes, which was something that Shinji knew would not be a good thing. " In fact, I have a little secret for you! Would you like to hear it?"  
Asuka 的母亲，" Heidi 替他说完了这句话。想到自己和 Asuka 的母亲竟然相识，Shinji 感到非常惊讶。Heidi 微笑着继续讲述她的故事："她们是好朋友，这一点我可以告诉你。我们经常一起做很多事情：聊天、购物，诸如此类。当 Yui 怀上你的时候，我们都非常兴奋，甚至包括你的父亲。Kyoko 非常高兴，她简直欣喜若狂！" Heidi 眯起眼睛看着 Shinji，这是 Shinji 知道不会是什么好事的表情。"事实上，我有个小秘密要告诉你！你想听吗？

"Uh, I guess so," Shinji gulped nervously. He recognized that look, it was the same one that Asuka and Misato would have when they would begin to tease him.  
"呃，我想是的，" Shinji 紧张地咽了咽口水。他认出了那个表情，和 Asuka 以及 Misato 开始捉弄他时的表情一模一样。

"Okay then, listen closely," Heidi said softly as she leaned forward, causing Shinji to do the same, "Did you now that you were the reason Asuka was born?" Heidi giggled at the look on Shinji's face as the blush ran to his face.  
"那么，仔细听好了，" Heidi 轻声说道，同时身体前倾，Shinji 也跟着凑近了些，"你知道吗，你其实是 Asuka 出生的原因？" Heidi 看到 Shinji 脸上的红晕，不禁咯咯笑了起来。

"Huh? What do you mean?" he stammered, causing Heidi to giggle harder. She could see the utter confusion in his eyes.  
"啊？你是什么意思？" 他结结巴巴地问道，这让 Heidi 笑得更厉害了。她能看出他眼中完全的困惑。

"Well, it wasn't too much longer after Yui became pregnant that Kyoko decided she wanted a baby, too. They used to giggle amongst themselves about how it would be so cool to see you two grow up together and get married some day!" Shinji's face turned redder than Unit Two's armour when Heidi said that, causing the German to start laughing heartily. "You know that Asuka was born just six months after you, right? Believe it or not, you two knew each other before you met last year. When you two were babies, Yui and Kyoko would put you two in the same crib with one another when ever they visited with each other. It was the strangest thing, though…" Heidi voice trailed off, as if pondering some sort of mystery from the past.  
"嗯，在 Yui 怀孕后不久，Kyoko 也决定要个孩子。她们曾私下里笑着说，看到你们俩一起长大，将来结婚该有多酷啊！" 当 Heidi 这么说时，Shinji 的脸比二号机的装甲还要红，这让德国人 Heidi 忍不住放声大笑。"你知道 Asuka 只比你晚出生六个月吗？信不信由你，你们俩在去年相遇之前就认识了。你们还是婴儿时，Yui 和 Kyoko 每次互相拜访时，都会把你们放在同一个婴儿床里。不过，有件事很奇怪……" Heidi 的声音渐渐减弱，仿佛在思考过去的某个谜团。

"What was so strange?" Shinji asked. Despite the teasing, he was enjoying listening to stories about his mother. Heidi looked back at him with a warm smile on her face.  
"什么事情很奇怪？" Shinji 问道。尽管被调侃，但他很喜欢听关于母亲的故事。Heidi 回头看着他，脸上带着温暖的微笑。

"Well, whenever we heard one of you two crying, we would go in and check on you. Usually, the crying stopped before we could get to you, and each and every time we would see one of you rolled over on your sides, comforting the other. It was so cute seeing one little baby with it's arm on the other, like it was telling it's friend it was okay." Heidi recalled fondly as she continued to watch the highly embarrassed young man. "Most of the time, you were the one who was comforting Asuka. She was always such a sad and cranky little baby, but she was never that way around you. It was like you were made for each other."  
“嗯，每当听到你们俩中的一个哭的时候，我们就会进去看看。通常，我们还没到，哭声就停了，每次我们都会看到其中一个宝宝侧身躺着，安慰另一个。一个小宝宝把手搭在另一个身上，好像在告诉朋友‘没事的’，那画面真是太可爱了。”海蒂回忆着，继续注视着那位极度尴尬的年轻人。“大多数时候，是你安慰明日香。她总是那么悲伤和暴躁，但在你身边，她从不会那样。就好像你们是为彼此而生的一样。”

"Well, things change," Shinji snorted, sadness coming to his eyes. "It seems that no matter what I do, all I do is make her angry. It's like she can't even stand to be in the same room with me, most of the time."  
“唉，事情总会变的，”真嗣哼了一声，眼中流露出悲伤。“无论我做什么，似乎都只会让她生气。大多数时候，她甚至无法忍受和我待在同一个房间里。”

"You're right, things do change, Shinji," Heidi agreed, taking note of the utter sadness in the Third Child's eyes. "But you have to remember, you two have gone through so much since then. Asuka was about a year old when we were all transferred back to _Deutschland_. She never seemed to be the same after that. Unfortunately, we never got a chance to spend any more time with you and your mother before your mother had her accident." Heidi's eyes reflected Shinji's sadness as she thought of her lost sister and their friend.  
"你说得对，事情确实会变，真嗣。"海蒂同意道，注意到第三适格者眼中深深的悲伤。"但你要记住，从那时起你们经历了那么多。我们回到德国时，明日香大约一岁，之后她似乎就变了个人。遗憾的是，在你母亲出事前，我们没能有机会再与你和你母亲共度更多时光。"海蒂的眼中映出了真嗣的悲伤，她想起了她失去的妹妹和他们的朋友。

"What was she like? My mother?" Shinji asked, but before Heidi could answer the front door opened and a familiar voice called out.  
"她是什么样的人？我的母亲？"真嗣问道，但海蒂还没来得及回答，前门就打开了，一个熟悉的声音喊道。

"I'm home," the bored voice of Asuka announced as the young redhead walked into the living room, just to stop dead in her tracks as she watched Shinji and Heidi stand to greet her. Her jaw dropped as her eyes grew wide in utter astonishment. She knew that her mind had finally snapped, and that the sight before her was nothing more than a hallucination.  
"我回来了。"明日香那带着倦意的声音宣布着，当这位年轻的红发少女走进客厅时，她突然停住了脚步，看着真嗣和海蒂起身迎接她。她的下巴掉了下来，眼睛因极度的惊讶而睁得大大的。她知道自己的脑子终于崩溃了，眼前的景象不过是一场幻觉。

"Hello Asuka," her aunt said as she noted the condition of her niece. Asuka was thinner than Heidi remembered, and the haunted look in her eyes frightened Heidi. Asuka looked like she was ready to collapse from shock, before her voice finally gained enough strength to say something.
“你好，明日香，”她的阿姨说道，同时注意到了侄女的状况。明日香比海蒂记忆中瘦了许多，她眼中的那种惊恐的神情让海蒂感到害怕。明日香看起来像是随时会因震惊而崩溃，直到她的声音终于有了足够的力气说出话来。

"Aunt…Aunt Heidi?" the younger German croaked, still not trusting her eyes.
“阿姨…阿姨海蒂？”年轻的德国女孩嘶哑地问道，仍然不敢相信自己的眼睛。

"Yes, little one, it's me," Heidi said gently as she watched Asuka's face crumple. After taking a small, hesitant step, Asuka leapt across the room and was immediately enfolded in the arms of her aunt. Silent tears streamed down her face as she and Heidi embraced one another, muttering softly to each other in German. Shinji looked on for a moment before stepping out of the living room and leaving the two to catch up with each other.
“是的，小家伙，是我，”海蒂温柔地说道，看着明日香的脸庞扭曲了。明日香小心翼翼地迈出一步，然后跳过房间，立刻被她的阿姨紧紧抱住。无声的泪水从她的脸颊上流下，她和海蒂互相拥抱，用德语轻声交谈。真嗣在一旁看了一会儿，然后走出客厅，让两人有时间叙旧。

---

As the weeks passed, Asuka seemed to improve slowly due to the ministrations of her aunt. Shinji was pleased to note that the fire that had always seemed to drive Asuka was ever so slowly beginning to return. Misato and Heidi got along quite well, which also pleased the young pilot of Unit One. It wasn't until later that Shinji discovered that the two had known each other back in Germany, where Misato had actually joined NERV.
随着时间的推移，明日香似乎在阿姨的照顾下慢慢好转。真嗣很高兴地注意到，一直驱使明日香的那种热情正逐渐开始回归。美里和海蒂相处得很好，这也让一号机的年轻驾驶员感到高兴。直到后来，真嗣才发现两人在德国时就认识，美里实际上曾在那里加入NERV。

What Shinji hadn't noticed was the change that was slowly beginning to over come himself. Misato had taken Heidi aside and asked if she could help Shinji as well as Asuka, to which the elder German readily agreed. She had seen the damage that the events of the past had caused Shinji, and she couldn't stand the fact that the happy little baby she had known had grown to become a very introverted young man. It took all her force of will to keep from marching into Gendo Ikari's office and putting a forty caliber round right between his eyes.
真嗣没有注意到的是，他自己也在慢慢发生变化。美里曾把海蒂拉到一旁，问她是否也能帮助真嗣，就像帮助明日香一样，这位年长的德国女士欣然同意。她看到了过去的事件对真嗣造成的伤害，她无法忍受那个她所认识的快乐小宝宝长大后变成了一个非常内向的年轻人。她几乎忍不住要冲进碇源堂的办公室，在他眼睛之间放上一颗四十口径的子弹。

Heidi made sure to pull Shinji aside everyday to talk to him, and had learned quite a lot about the young Third Child. She learned how much his father's abandonment had torn him asunder when he was but a small child. She was pleased to discover that he had finally made friends when he came to Tokyo-3, but was saddened to learn that he had been forced to cripple one and destroy another. She was shocked to learn that he had a sister, but proud at how quickly he had embraced her as a member of the family, despite the fact her emotional growth had been severely delayed.
海蒂每天都确保把真嗣拉到一旁和他交谈，并了解了很多关于这位年轻的第三适格者的信息。她了解到他的父亲在他还是个小孩子时就抛弃了他，这对他造成了多大的伤害。她很高兴地发现他来到第三新东京市后终于交到了朋友，但得知他被迫使一个朋友残废，摧毁了另一个朋友，她感到悲伤。她震惊地得知他有一个妹妹，但对他如此迅速地接纳她作为家庭的一员感到骄傲，尽管她的情感发展严重滞后。

The thing that made Heidi the happiest was when she discovered that Shinji had feelings for her niece. It had taken a lot of poking and prodding, but he had let the clues slip out in bits and pieces. She realized, however, that he would never actually come out and do anything about it due to his fear of rejection. It wasn't until toward the end of summer that she got her first actual sign that he truly felt deeply about Asuka.
最让海蒂高兴的是，她发现真嗣对她侄女有感情。尽管费了不少劲，但他还是一点一点地透露出了线索。然而，她意识到，由于害怕被拒绝，他永远不会真正采取行动。直到夏末，她才第一次真正意识到他对明日香的感情有多深。

"Hey, Shinji, what's up?" she asked one day as she walked into the apartment to check up on Asuka. Heidi had noticed that despite the progress her niece had made, she seemed to start to slide back into the black well of despair that always seemed to threaten the young redhead. "Is Asuka around?"
“嘿，真嗣，怎么了？”一天，她走进公寓检查明日香的情况时问道。海蒂注意到，尽管她的侄女取得了进展，但她似乎又开始滑向那个总是威胁着这位年轻红发女孩的绝望深渊。“明日香在吗？”

"Oh, hello Heidi," Shinji called back as he walked toward the open balcony door with a cello case in one hand and a chair in the other. "She's in her room, but I don't think she's feeling to well today. She's only been out a few times today to go to the bathroom, that's it."
“哦，你好，海蒂，”真嗣回应道，他正拿着一个大提琴盒和一把椅子走向开着的阳台门。“她在她的房间里，但我觉得她今天感觉不太好。她今天只出来过几次去洗手间，仅此而已。”

"Really?" Heidi frowned as she turned her attention to her niece's room and knocked before walking in. "Asuka?" She was shocked at what she saw.
“真的吗？”海蒂皱着眉头，转向她侄女的房间，敲了敲门然后走了进去。“明日香？”她看到的一幕让她震惊。

"What the hell do you want?" the Second Child croaked as she sat upon her bed, her knees pulled to her chest. Heidi was shocked to see the dark circles around her eyes, at how pale her skin was, and how listless she seemed.
“你到底想干什么？”二号机的驾驶员嘶哑地问道，她坐在床上，膝盖蜷缩到胸前。海蒂震惊地看到她眼睛周围的黑眼圈，她苍白的皮肤，以及她看起来多么无精打采。

"Excuse me?" The elder redhead snarled as she placed her hands on her hips and stared down her niece. Asuka cringed at the look she aunt was giving her. "Watch your language! And is that how you're supposed to greet your aunt?"
“你说什么？”年长的红发女子咆哮道，双手叉腰，瞪着她的侄女。明日香在她阿姨的目光下退缩了。“注意你的言辞！这就是你问候你阿姨的方式吗？”

"Uh, no ma'am. I'm s-sorry," Asuka replied, sniffling a bit. Heidi's face softened as she saw how badly Asuka felt. "I just don't feel too good today, Auntie."
“呃，不，女士。对不起，”明日香回答道，抽泣了一下。海蒂的脸色缓和下来，她看到明日香感觉有多糟糕。“我只是今天感觉不太好，阿姨。”

"I can see that," Heidi said as she walked over and sat on the edge of her niece's bed. "What's wrong?" Asuka refused to look up into her aunt's eyes.
“我能看出来，”海蒂说道，走过去坐在她侄女的床边。“怎么了？”明日香拒绝抬头看她阿姨的眼睛。

"I didn't get any sleep last night, that's all," Asuka replied. Heidi reached over and stroked her limp, lifeless hair.
“我昨晚没睡，就这样，”明日香回答道。海蒂伸手过去抚摸她毫无生气的头发。

"The nightmares again?" Heidi asked, to which Asuka slowly nodded. "You told me you had a way to deal with that. What happened?" Asuka shrugged. She didn't want to tell her Aunt that Shinji had spent the night at Kensuke's, and the sweet music he played for her when she needed it wasn't there. She didn't want Heidi to know she depended on anyone, especially Shinji Ikari.
“又是噩梦吗？”海蒂问道，明日香慢慢地点了点头。“你告诉过我你有办法处理这个。发生了什么？”明日香耸了耸肩。她不想告诉她阿姨，昨晚真嗣在健介那里过夜，他为她演奏的甜美音乐不在那里。她不想让海蒂知道她依赖任何人，尤其是碇真嗣。

"I…it…he…I just couldn't do it last night," Asuka sighed, a very terrible soul shaking sigh at that.
“我…它…他…我昨晚就是做不到，”明日香叹息道，那是一个非常可怕的、灵魂颤抖的叹息。

"Why don't you tell me about the nightmares," Heidi prodded carefully, hoping to get her niece to open up and confront her demons head-on. The elder German was frightened, as Asuka was beginning to look like Death warmed over.
“为什么不告诉我关于噩梦的事，”海蒂小心翼翼地问道，希望能让她的侄女敞开心扉，直接面对她的心魔。这位年长的德国女士感到害怕，因为明日香开始看起来像是死神刚热过身。

"It's the same one," Asuka croaked as she tried to keep the images back in the farthest reaches of her mind, "the same one I used to have back in Germany, about …about…" her words trailed off. Heidi became concerned as Asuka just stopped everything and began to stare off into space. The NERV captain silently cursed all Angels, having seen what had happened to her strong, self-confident niece after the Fifteenth's attack.  
“是同一个，”明日香嘶哑地说道，试图将那些画面挡在脑海最深处，“就是我在德国时用的那个，大约……大约……”她的话渐渐消失。海蒂开始担心，因为明日香突然停下一切，开始凝视远方。这位 NERV 的队长默默诅咒着所有使徒，亲眼目睹了她坚强自信的侄女在第十五使徒袭击后所经历的一切。

"Asuka? What's the matter?" Heidi asked anxiously as the younger German stood up from her bed and began to walk towards the door, as if she were in some sort of trance. She reached out and grabbed Asuka's hand. "Asuka!"  
"明日香？怎么了？" 海蒂焦急地问道，因为年轻的德国女孩从床上起身，开始走向门口，仿佛处于某种恍惚状态。她伸出手抓住了明日香的手。"明日香！"

"Huh? What?" the pilot of Unit Two asked as she slowly turned her head and gazed at her aunt.  
"啊？什么？" 二号机驾驶员缓缓转过头，凝视着她的阿姨。

"What's wrong?" Heidi asked once more. She made a mental note to go and ask the NERV psychiatrists to run an evaluation on Asuka as soon as possible. As a high ranking member of NERV security, she had the power to do so. The welfare of her niece was extremely important to herself and to NERV. So far, no one else had been able to synch with Unit Two, other than the Seventeenth. As of right now, NERV was down to one functional EVA and one functional pilot. Unit Zero had not yet been regenerated, and Unit Two refused to synch with Rei for some strange reason, as did Unit One. God help the world if the Angels attacked at this time.  
"怎么回事？" 海蒂再次问道。她暗自决定尽快让 NERV 的心理医生对明日香进行评估。作为 NERV 安全部门的高级成员，她有权这么做。她侄女的福祉对她自己和 NERV 都极为重要。迄今为止，除了第十七使徒之外，还没有其他人能够与二号机同步。目前，NERV 只剩下一个可用的 EVA 和一个可用的驾驶员。零号机尚未修复，二号机和一号机都拒绝与绫波同步，原因不明。如果此时使徒发动攻击，愿上帝保佑这个世界。

"Oh. Nothing," Asuka mumbled as she stumbled past her aunt and left her room, followed quickly by Heidi. Asuka made a beeline for the balcony door, as if she were drawn it by some supernatural force. Heidi was at this time extremely frightened for her niece until a low droning that had just been on the edge of her senses increased in volume.  
“哦，没什么。”明日香咕哝着，踉跄地从阿姨身边走过，离开了房间，海蒂紧随其后。明日香径直走向阳台门，仿佛被某种超自然力量所吸引。海蒂此时对她的侄女感到极度担忧，直到她刚刚感知边缘的低沉嗡鸣声逐渐增大。

Much to Heidi's surprise and relief, she watched as Asuka walked out to the balcony and took a seat on the floor at one corner of the balcony. She watched as her niece closed her eyes and visibly relaxed, a small smile appearing on her face. This wasn't a false smile like the one she would put on at times to keep everyone from seeing how miserable she really was. No, it was a true, contented smile. Heidi stood in the doorway and watched in amazement as she realized that the low sound she had heard was coming from one Shinji Ikari, who continued to play his cello with his eyes closed and seemingly oblivious to the rest of the world.  
令海蒂既惊讶又欣慰的是，她看到明日香走到阳台上，在阳台的一角坐下。她看着侄女闭上眼睛，明显放松下来，脸上浮现出一丝微笑。这不是她有时为了不让别人看到自己有多么痛苦而戴上的那种假笑。不，这是一个真正满足的微笑。海蒂站在门口，惊奇地看着，她意识到那低沉的声音来自真嗣一辉，他继续闭着眼睛，似乎对周围的世界浑然不觉，专注地拉着大提琴。

An hour passed before Shinji finally set his cherished string instrument aside and stood up to stretch his legs. Heidi had stood in the doorway, enraptured, the entire time. She was so pleased to discover that Shinji had developed the same talent as her long dead friend had so many years prior. The redheaded NERV captain glanced back toward her niece and was pleased to see Asuka's eyes were closed and she was breathing steadily. The young lady had finally fallen asleep to Shinji's music.  
一小时过去，真嗣终于放下他珍爱的弦乐器，起身舒展双腿。海蒂一直站在门口，全神贯注。她很高兴发现真嗣拥有了与她多年前逝去的朋友相同的才华。红发的 NERV 队长回头看向侄女，欣慰地看到明日香闭着眼睛，呼吸平稳。这位年轻女士终于在真嗣的音乐中入睡了。

"Oh, hello again, Heidi," Shinji whispered as he finally noticed her in the doorway as he began to walk toward Asuka. "I didn't disturb you, did I?" Heidi shook her head.  
“哦，海蒂，又见面了。”真嗣低声说道，当他走向明日香时，终于注意到门口的她。“我没打扰到你吧？”海蒂摇了摇头。

"No, Shinji, you didn't. You play quite beautifully, you know? It reminds me so much of Yui's playing," she responded softly, so as not to disturb Asuka. Shinji's eyes widened a bit at this bit of information.  
“没有，真嗣，你没有。你弹得非常美，你知道吗？让我想起了优的演奏。”她轻声回应，以免打扰到明日香。听到这个消息，真嗣的眼睛微微睁大了些。

"Really? I never got to hear her play," Shinji replied as he walked over to Asuka and gently lifted the young lady up from the ground, bridal style, and turned toward the door. Heidi was both shocked and thrilled at the shy young pilot's actions. She walked back inside the apartment, allowing Shinji to follow after with his slumbering burden.  
"真的吗？我从未听过她演奏，" 真嗣回答着，走向明日香，温柔地将她从地上抱起，以新娘抱的姿势，转身向门口走去。海蒂对这位害羞的年轻驾驶员的举动既感到震惊又感到兴奋。她走回公寓内，让真嗣带着他沉睡的负担跟随其后。

"Huh? Shinji?" Asuka mumbled in her sleep as the young man stepped toward the living room sofa.  
"嗯？真嗣？" 明日香在睡梦中喃喃自语，当年轻人走向客厅的沙发时。

"Shhh," he replied so very softly and gently, causing her to snuggle closer to his chest. Slowly, he lowered her to the sofa, then quickly retreated and returned with a soft blanket. He carefully tucked her in, then gently stroked the side of her face, causing a smile to appear on Asuka's lips. Shinji smiled back as he bent back down and gave her a quick little kiss on her forehead, causing the young German to snuggle down deeper into the sofa and blanket. The image of one young baby comforting the other flashed before Heidi's eyes.  
"嘘，" 他如此轻柔地回答，让她更紧地依偎在他的胸前。他慢慢地将她放下到沙发上，然后迅速退回去拿来一条柔软的毯子。他小心翼翼地为她盖上，然后轻轻抚摸她的脸颊，让明日香的唇边露出了微笑。真嗣回以微笑，弯下腰在她额头上轻轻一吻，让这位年轻的德国女孩更深地蜷缩进沙发和毯子里。一个婴儿安慰另一个婴儿的画面在海蒂眼前闪过。

"You really do care for her, don't you?" Heidi observed as she followed Shinji back out to the balcony, where he proceeded to repack his cello.  
"你真的很关心她，不是吗？" 海蒂边说边跟着真嗣回到阳台，他开始重新打包他的大提琴。

"Well, sure I do. She's my friend, after all, whether she wants to admit to it or not," Shinji replied as he made sure that everything was packed correctly before closing the case. "I care for her and Misato both. If I don't take care of them, they'd both starve to death, and drown in a sea of garbage!" he chuckled lightly as he picked up his case and the chair he had been sitting in and began to walk back inside. He stopped as he felt Heidi's hand on his shoulder. She turned him to look back toward her.  
"当然，我确实关心她。毕竟她是我的朋友，不管她是否愿意承认，" 真嗣回答道，他确保一切都打包正确后才合上箱子。"我关心她和美里两个人。如果我不照顾她们，她们都会饿死，淹没在垃圾的海洋里！" 他轻声笑着，拿起箱子和刚才坐的椅子，开始走回室内。他停下脚步，感觉到海蒂的手搭在他的肩膀上。她转过身来，让他回头看向她。

"That's not what I mean, Shinji, although I am very grateful for you looking after them both. If they had to live off of Misato's cooking…well…let's just say her cooking should be loaded into missiles and fired at the Angels. That would probably kill them in a single shot!" Heidi said, earning a smile from the young man. Her eyes and face became soft with compassion as she plowed onward. "Do you really _care_ for Asuka?" Shinji cast his eyes downward as the blush, once more, made it's appearance on his cheeks. "That's why you play for her, right? You can always tell when she's really feeling out of sorts, and that's when you get your cello out."  
"那不是我的意思，真嗣，虽然我非常感激你照顾她们俩。如果她们得靠美里做饭维生……嗯……这么说吧，她的厨艺应该装进导弹里，射向使徒。那可能一击就能干掉它们！" 海蒂说道，让年轻人露出了微笑。她的眼神和面容变得柔和，充满同情地继续说道："你真的关心明日香吗？" 真嗣垂下目光，脸颊再次泛起红晕。"这就是你为她演奏的原因，对吧？你总能察觉到她情绪低落的时候，那时你就会拿出你的大提琴。"

"It helps to relax her and let her sleep, that's all. She probably can't stand my playing, but it sooths her anyway," he replied as he stared through the doorway at the slumbering redhead. "It's the least I can do." Heidi smiled at the warmth she could see in the young man's eyes. She really hoped that the two of them could help each other out.  
"这有助于让她放松并入睡，仅此而已。她可能受不了我的演奏，但无论如何这能安抚她，" 他回答道，透过门缝凝视着熟睡的红发女孩。"这是我至少能做的。" 海蒂看到年轻人眼中流露出的温暖，微笑着。她真心希望他们俩能互相帮助。

"To answer your question: yes, I care for her, a lot!" Shinji continued. Heidi hoped that expressing his feeling openly would help him to move forward. "But it doesn't matter, Heidi. I know Asuka hates me. She could never care for a guy like me! I'm a coward and a weakling. I'm everything that Asuka despises. I couldn't save her, I failed her. She can't forgive me for that!" Shinji seemed to deflate before her eyes.  
"回答你的问题：是的，我很在乎她，非常在乎！" 真嗣继续说道。海蒂希望他坦诚表达自己的感情能帮助他向前迈进。"但这无关紧要，海蒂。我知道明日香恨我。她不可能喜欢我这样的人！我是个懦夫，是个弱者。我就是明日香所鄙视的一切。我没能救她，我让她失望了。她无法原谅我这一点！" 真嗣似乎在她眼前萎靡不振。

Heidi frowned. It seems that the self-loathing Shinji had for himself ran so deep he even projected it on others. He believed that everyone else hated him as much as he hated himself. She knew for a fact that Asuka liked the boy, whether she actually came out and said it or not. Asuka's letters were filled with things about Shinji, especially about a certain event that occurred between the two of them the previous year. She decided to probe deeper.  
海蒂皱起眉头。看来真嗣对自己的厌恶如此之深，以至于他甚至将这种情绪投射到别人身上。他相信其他人也像他自己一样恨他。她确切地知道明日香喜欢这个男孩，无论她是否真的说出口。明日香的信中充满了关于真嗣的事情，尤其是关于去年他们两人之间发生的一件特定事件。她决定深入探究。

"Have you ever told Asuka how you feel about her? You'll never know how she truly feels about you until you give it a try! Tell me something, have you two ever held hands, or hugged?" she asked, watching intently for the boy's reactions.  
"你有没有告诉过明日香你对她的感觉？如果你不尝试，你永远不会知道她对你的真实感受！告诉我，你们俩有没有牵过手，或者拥抱过？" 她问道，密切观察着男孩的反应。

"Uh, no ma'am," Shinji replied as he fought his hardest not to allow himself to blush. The only time he ever held Asuka was that one night he had had that strange dream. Other than carrying her to the sofa anytime she fell asleep listening to him play, that was the only time.  
"“呃，没有，女士，”真嗣回答道，他竭尽全力不让自己脸红。他唯一一次抱过明日香是在那个奇怪的梦里。除了每次她听着他演奏睡着后把她抱到沙发上，那也是唯一的一次。”

"Okay then, have you two ever kissed each other?" the elder German asked, knowing full well the answer to that one. Asuka had written her shortly afterwards and told her how pleasant the kiss from the Third Child had been, and that she was disappointed at him for pulling away, and disappointed with herself at her reactions.  
"“那么，你们俩接过吻吗？”那位年长的德国人问道，她心里清楚这个问题的答案。明日香在那之后不久给她写信，告诉她第三适格者的吻是多么愉快，以及她对他退缩的失望，还有对自己反应的失望。”

"Um, um, um," Shinji stammered, his face redder than a lobster and so flustered that he almost dropped his cello. He remembered that night as one of the best and one of the worst nights in his short life. There was nothing like giving your first kiss to a girl you cared for, and having said girl go running screaming into the bathroom. "Y-yes ma'am," he stammered softly.  
"“呃，呃，呃，”真嗣结结巴巴地说，他的脸红得像龙虾一样，慌乱得几乎把大提琴掉在地上。他记得那一晚是他短暂生命中最好也是最糟糕的夜晚之一。没有什么比把初吻献给你在乎的女孩更美好的了，尽管那个女孩尖叫着跑进了浴室。“是的，女士，”他轻声结巴道。”

"WHAT?! You and Asuka kissed?! When the hell did that happen?!" a certain dark-haired Major screamed from the open doorway. Shinji's eyes grew as large as Unit One's as his head whipped around and saw his guardian standing there in a complete state of shock. The Coward ran over and kicked Shinji in the balls and began to drag him into the shadows, causing Shinji to want to shrink down and hide in his cello case, bawling his eyes out in shame and embarrassment. It was then The Man came out and beat the crap out of The Coward and threw Shinji back into the light.  
"什么？！你和明日香接吻了？！这到底是什么时候的事？！" 一位黑发少校从敞开的门口尖叫道。真嗣的眼睛瞪得像初号机一样大，他的头猛地转过去，看到他的监护人站在那里，完全处于震惊状态。懦夫跑过来踢了真嗣的裆部，开始把他拖进阴影中，这让真嗣想缩进他的大提琴箱里，泪流满面地羞愧和尴尬。就在这时，那个人走了出来，狠狠地揍了懦夫一顿，把真嗣扔回了光明中。

"Misato! Hush!" Shinji hissed softly as he stormed into the living room. "Asuka's finally asleep!"  
"美里！小声点！" 真嗣轻声呵斥着，冲进了客厅。"明日香终于睡着了！"

"Huh? Oh! Sorry!" the Major whispered back, slightly taken aback by the intensity of Shinji's response. "She have a bad night last night?"  
"嗯？哦！对不起！" 少校低声回道，对真嗣反应的强烈程度稍感意外。"她昨晚睡得不好吗？"

"Yeah," Shinji relied quietly as he bent down and checked on the young redhead. Shinji shot a rather naughty warm-water penguin a dirty look as Pen-Pen quietly crept up on Asuka's bare feet with a feather in his claws. Pen-Pen realized that look meant that he would be eating nothing but Misato's cooking for the next month if he continued on his course of action. He quickly thought better about what he was doing and rapidly retreated back to his refrigerator. "Okay, good! She's still asleep," Shinji whispered softly as he turned to go to his room, only to be stopped by Misato.  
"“嗯，”真嗣轻声应道，他弯下腰查看那位年轻的红发少女。真嗣朝那只调皮的热水企鹅投去一个警告的眼神，只见 Pen-Pen 悄悄地靠近明日香的赤脚，爪子里还抓着一根羽毛。Pen-Pen 意识到那个眼神意味着如果他继续这样，接下来一个月只能吃美里做的饭了。他迅速改变了主意，急忙退回到冰箱旁。“好，很好！她还在睡，”真嗣轻声细语地说着，转身准备回房间，却被美里拦住了。”

"Where do you think you're going, mister?" Misato hissed softly as she stood before the young pilot with her hands on her hips. " I still want to know about that kiss! Have you two gone further than that? I'm your guardian, for Pete's sake! If I can't trust you two alone with each other, than I may be forced to separate you!" Shinji's eyes grew wide in fear before he opened his mouth and began to explain.  
"“你以为你要去哪儿，小子？”美里双手叉腰，轻声呵斥，挡在年轻驾驶员面前。“我还想知道那个吻的事呢！你们俩有没有更进一步？我可是你的监护人，看在上帝的份上！如果我不能信任你们俩单独相处，那我可能不得不把你们分开！”真嗣的眼睛因恐惧而睁大，他张开嘴开始解释。”

"It was only one kiss, Misato," Shinji began as sadness started to creep back into his eyes. "It was last year when you went to that wedding. Asuka was bored and pretty much dared me to kiss her. After teasing me to no end, I took her up on her offer. It…didn't end well. I really don't think she enjoyed it too much. She…uh…well…" he faltered and cast his eyes to the ground. He couldn't see the sparkle in his guardian's eyes, or the teasing smirk on her face.  
"那只是一次亲吻，美里，" 真嗣开口道，眼中再次流露出悲伤。"那是去年你去参加婚礼的时候。明日香觉得无聊，几乎是在挑衅我亲她。她不停地逗弄我，最后我接受了她的挑战。结果……并不好。我真的不觉得她有多享受。她……呃……嗯……" 他结巴起来，目光转向地面。他没有看到监护人眼中闪烁的光芒，也没有注意到她脸上戏谑的微笑。

"She what?" Misato urged him to continue. Heidi covered her eyes with her hand and shook her head as she stood behind Shinji, like she was trying to back him up.  
"她怎么了？" 美里催促他继续说下去。海蒂站在真嗣身后，用手遮住眼睛，摇了摇头，仿佛在试图支持他。

"I must be a lousy kisser, Misato, because she ran away and began to brush her teeth, screaming about how she never kiss to kill time," he replied softly, a trace of hurt in his voice. Misato's face softened as she felt the pain that was coming from her young charge like it was a physical force. She looked up at Heidi, who silently mouthed that she would explain it later. "Other than that, the only physical contact we have is when she's hitting me, or when I pick her up and put her on the sofa when she's asleep."  
"我一定是个糟糕的吻者，美里，因为她跑开了，开始刷牙，尖叫着说她再也不为了打发时间而接吻了，" 他轻声回答，声音中带着一丝受伤。美里看到她年轻的被监护人所承受的痛苦如同一种实体力量，她的表情柔和了下来。她抬头看向海蒂，后者默默地用口型表示稍后会解释。"除此之外，我们唯一的身体接触就是她打我，或者我抱她到沙发上睡觉的时候。"

"Oh," Misato replied softly as she stood aside and let Shinji pass by her. "So, whatcha doing now?" Shinji looked up with his sad, puppy-dog eyes.  
"哦，" 美里轻声回应，侧身让真嗣从她身边经过。"那么，你现在在做什么呢？" 真嗣抬起头，眼中带着悲伤，像只小狗一样。

"I'm a little tired, Misato. I'm going to go lie down for a while. Don't worry about dinner, I'll get up and make it later," Shinji replied as he trudged to his room, his mood completely shot as depression once more began to close in on him. Heidi and Misato watched as he closed his bedroom door before the two of them retreated to the kitchen for tea and beer.  
"我有点累了，美里。我要去躺一会儿。不用担心晚饭，我待会儿会起来做的，" 真嗣回答道，拖着沉重的步伐走向自己的房间，情绪完全低落，抑郁再次向他袭来。海蒂和美里看着他关上卧室门，然后两人退到厨房去喝茶和啤酒。

"Well, that didn't go well," Misato huffed as she took her seat at the table and cracked open a beer and downing half the can in one swig. "Urp!"  
"唉，那可不太顺利，" 美里叹了口气，坐在桌前，打开一罐啤酒，一口气喝掉了半罐。"呃！"

"Those kids," Heidi sighed as she took a sip of tea, "I have worked so hard these past few weeks to get them to open up, and when they finally do, it lasts for only the briefest of moments." She stared at her tea glass for several seconds and silently wished it was something a bit stronger. She cursed herself and reminded herself that she needed to keep a clear head for those two.  
"那些孩子，" 海蒂叹了口气，抿了一口茶，"我过去几周费尽心思让他们敞开心扉，可他们好不容易打开心扉，却只维持了那么一瞬间。" 她盯着茶杯看了几秒钟，默默希望那是些更烈的东西。她暗自咒骂自己，提醒自己需要保持清醒的头脑来面对那两个孩子。

"They actually opened up some?" Misato asked, somewhat incredulous. Heidi nodded her head, as a frown continued to mar her features.  
"他们真的敞开了一些？" 美里有些难以置信地问。海蒂点点头，眉头依旧紧锁。

"Yeah, but just a little. I finally got to see Asuka's vulnerable side today, as well as Shinji's caring and decisive side." Misato raised an eyebrow at this.  
"是的，但只是一点点。今天我终于看到了明日香脆弱的一面，还有真嗣关心和果断的一面。" 美里对此扬了扬眉毛。

"Shinji's always caring, Heidi," the dark-haired Major spoke up, defending her charge. Heidi nodded her head in agreement.  
"真嗣总是很关心人，海蒂，" 黑发的美里少校开口为她的被保护者辩护。海蒂点头表示同意。

"Yes, he is. However, his own self-loathing tends to overshadow it. He believes himself to be worthless, despite everything he does for people. Therefore, it tends to taint everything he does, in his mind at least." Heidi affirmed.  
"是的，他是这样。然而，他对自己的厌恶往往掩盖了这一点。他认为自己毫无价值，尽管他为人们所做的一切。因此，至少在他看来，这往往会玷污他所做的一切。" 海蒂确认道。

"And today was different because?" Misato urged as she finished her beer and opened a new one.  
"而今天有什么不同呢？" 美里催促道，她喝完啤酒并打开了一罐新的。

"Because there was no trace of his self-loathing when he took care of Asuka. I watched as he played for her to get her to sleep, then picked her up and got her comfortable before kissing her head," Misato's eyes shot open wide at this little bit of information, and she tried to keep from spraying her guest with beer. "The only thing I saw in his eyes was his deep…feelings…for Asuka," Heidi answered, a warm smile caressing her face.  
"因为他在照顾明日香时没有一丝自我厌恶的痕迹。我看着他为了哄她入睡而演奏，然后抱起她让她舒服，最后亲吻她的额头，" 美里听到这些细节时眼睛瞪得大大的，努力忍住不把啤酒喷到客人身上。"我在他眼中看到的只有他对明日香深深的……情感……" 海蒂回答道，脸上带着温暖的微笑。

"Aww, that sounds so cute!" Misato gushed, " I wish I could have seen that! Shinji actually kissed her?" Heidi giggled as the two continued to chat about the young pilots.  
"哎呀，听起来真可爱！" 美里激动地说，"真希望我当时能看到！真嗣真的亲了她吗？" 海蒂咯咯笑着，两人继续聊着年轻驾驶员的话题。

"What are you two hens cackling about?" grunted Asuka, her eyes half closed as she stumbled into the kitchen. She reached for a glass and filled it with water. The two older women jumped at the interruption.  
"你们两个老母鸡在咯咯叫什么呢？" 明日香咕哝着，眼睛半闭着跌跌撞撞走进厨房。她伸手去拿了一个玻璃杯，倒满了水。两位年长的女士被这突如其来的打断吓了一跳。

"Eep!" Misato squeaked as she lost the battle this time and shot beer clear across the table. Luckily, Heidi's reflexes kicked in as she leaned to the side and avoided the spray.  
"哎呀！" 美里这次败下阵来，啤酒喷射而出，横扫桌面。幸好海蒂反应迅速，侧身一躲，避开了这股喷溅。

"Uh, nothing!" Heidi chimed in as her niece leaned back on the counter and finished her drink.  
"呃，没什么！" 海蒂赶紧接话，侄女则靠在柜台上，喝完了她的饮料。

"Yeah, sure, whatever," Asuka muttered as she trudged back across the room before stopping in the doorway. "So, who did Shinji kiss?" Both women stopped dead, their eyes widening as the color drained from their faces.  
"是啊，随便吧，" 明日香嘟囔着，拖着脚步穿过房间，在门口停下。"那么，真嗣吻了谁？" 两位女士顿时僵住，双眼圆睁，脸色煞白。

"Well, it wasn't really a kiss," Heidi began, her eyes looking up toward the ceiling as if deep in thought, "It was more like a small peck on the head." Asuka snorted in disgust.  
"嗯，那其实算不上一个吻，" 海蒂开始说道，她的眼睛望向天花板，仿佛陷入了沉思，"更像是在头上轻轻一啄。" 明日香嗤之以鼻，表示厌恶。

"Whatever. Like that wimp would ever have the balls to kiss someone! He doesn't care for anyone other than himself," the younger redhead said softly as she began to turn to leave.  
"随你怎么说。像那种懦夫怎么可能有胆量亲吻别人！他只在乎他自己，" 年轻的红发女孩轻声说道，开始转身离开。

"Asuka! That's not true and you know it!" Heidi snapped back. "So quit acting like that! You know, it was Shinji that wrote me to come and see you! I had no idea what had happened to you until he sent me a letter explaining everything! He did that for you!" Heidi was extremely upset at her nieces attitude. Asuka just shook her head and left the room, a small smile carefully hidden on her face. She knew Shinji had kissed her, even if the other two were too much of cowards to tell her. Asuka loved to see that side of Shinji: the strong, caring side. She curled back up on the sofa and closed her eyes, her dreams no longer haunted, but warm and secure. Her dreams were of a certain blue-eyed boy.  
"明日香！那不是真的，你知道的！" 海蒂厉声反驳，"别再那样装模作样了！你知道吗，是真嗣写信让我来看你的！他给我寄了一封信，解释了所有事情，我才知道你发生了什么！他这么做都是为了你！" 海蒂对侄女的态度感到非常沮丧。明日香只是摇了摇头，离开了房间，脸上藏着一丝不易察觉的微笑。她知道真嗣吻了她，即使另外两人没有勇气告诉她。明日香喜欢看到真嗣坚强、关怀的一面。她蜷缩回沙发上，闭上了眼睛，她的梦境不再充满恐惧，而是温暖而安全。她的梦里，是一个有着蓝色眼睛的男孩。

--

"Do you really have to go?" Asuka whined as she held her aunt tightly. Heidi gently stroked her niece's hair, trying to sooth Asuka.  
"你真的非走不可吗？" 明日香抱怨着紧紧抱住她的阿姨。海蒂温柔地抚摸着侄女的头发，试图安抚明日香。

"Yes, little one, I do," she said somewhat sadly. "I only had so much leave time built up, you know? Don't worry, I promise to be back next summer, okay?" She looked into Asuka's eyes and saw the sadness had been replaced with hope. "Now, let me take my leave of your room mates."  
"是的，小家伙，我必须得走，" 她有些悲伤地说。"你知道的，我的假期时间有限。别担心，我保证明年夏天会回来的，好吗？" 她看着明日香的眼睛，发现悲伤已被希望取代。"现在，让我和你的室友们道个别吧。"

"It was good to see you again, Misato!" Heidi said as she and Misato hugged tightly. "Take care of those two, will ya?"  
"再次见到你真好，美里！" 海蒂和美里紧紧拥抱。"照顾好那两个孩子，好吗？"

"I always do," Misato replied, trying hard to fight back the tears. It had been good to see her old friend again. Heidi let her go and turned toward Shinji. The pilot of Unit One had his head bowed and was looking at his feet. Heidi sighed, because no matter how hard she had worked with both pilots, they had made so little progress. She took a step forward and lifted his chin with her fingertips, but his eyes still refused to look up.  
"我总是这样，"美里回答道，努力抑制住泪水。再次见到老朋友感觉真好。海蒂松开她，转向真嗣。初号机驾驶员低着头，目光落在脚上。海蒂叹了口气，无论她与两位驾驶员付出了多少努力，他们的进步都微乎其微。她向前迈了一步，用指尖抬起他的下巴，但他的眼睛依旧不愿抬起。

"Shinji, look at me please," she commanded gently, causing the young man to look up at her bright blue eyes. Her eyes reminded him so much of the girl he cared for. "What did I tell you about not looking at people when they talk to you? Some people may think it's rude."  
"真嗣，请看着我，"她温柔地命令道，让年轻人抬头望向她明亮的蓝眼睛。她的眼睛让他想起了他关心的那个女孩。"我告诉过你，别人跟你说话时不要不看着对方，有些人可能会觉得这样很无礼。"

"Sorry," he muttered. Heidi could feel his pain. "I'm going to miss you," he added softly. Heidi smiled warmly at this. Maybe she had more of an influence on him than she had thought.  
"对不起，"他低声说道。海蒂能感受到他的痛苦。"我会想念你的，"他轻声补充道。海蒂对此报以温暖的微笑。也许她对他的影响比自己想象的要大。

"Quit apologizing so much!" she admonished playfully, gently rapping him on the side of the head, bringing a small smile from the young man. "I'm going to miss you too, _Herr_ Ikari! Now listen closely, I want you to do two things for me, okay?" Shinji nodded his head. " First off, I want you to keep looking after Asuka for me, just like you have been. Can you do that for me?"  
"别再这么频繁地道歉了！" 她半开玩笑地责备道，轻轻敲了敲他的头侧，让年轻人露出一丝微笑。"我也会想念你的，一尉真嗣！现在仔细听好，我要你为我做两件事，好吗？" 真嗣点点头。"首先，我希望你继续照顾明日香，就像你一直在做的那样。你能做到吗？"

"Uh, sure," Shinji agreed readily, wondering what the second thing could be.  
"呃，当然可以，" 真嗣欣然同意，好奇第二件事会是什么。

"_Sehr gute_! Now, for the second thing. I want you to take care of yourself! Quit telling yourself that you're worthless! Shinji, you are probably the nicest guy I have ever met, and you seem to hate yourself! Please, for me and for Asuka, see the good inside yourself, and see the good that you do!" Heidi pleaded. She hated seeing Shinji being so down on himself.  
"非常好！现在，第二件事。我要你照顾好自己！别再对自己说你一文不值了！真嗣，你可能是我见过的最善良的人，而你却似乎讨厌自己！请为了我和明日香，看到你内心的美好，看到你所做的好事！" 海蒂恳求道。她讨厌看到真嗣如此自暴自弃。

"I…I'll try," Shinji replied softly, finding it hard to even think about himself in a positive light whatsoever. He just knew, that deep down inside, he was a horrible, awful person. He knew that no matter what anyone else ever said, he would never be able to change his mind. Heidi saw the inner battle taking place, and prayed to what ever deity was listening, that good would come from it.  
"我……我会试试，" 真嗣轻声回答，发现自己很难以积极的眼光看待自己。他内心深处知道自己是个糟糕透顶的人。他明白，无论别人怎么说，他永远无法改变自己的想法。海蒂看到了他内心的挣扎，祈祷着有哪位神明在聆听，希望好事会因此发生。

"Do more than try, just do it!" Heidi whispered back as she placed her forehead to his and looked him squarely in the eyes. "For starters, why don't you follow your heart and tell Asuka how you really feel? You never know what the answer will be until you actually follow a determined course of action!" she giggled softly, doing her best to put her military and security persona on and failing miserably. Her giggles brought a smile to the young pilot's face for the first time that day.  
"不仅仅是尝试，去做吧！" 海蒂低声回应，将额头贴在他的额头上，直视他的眼睛。"首先，为什么不跟随你的心，告诉明日香你的真实感受呢？你不采取坚定的行动，永远不知道答案会是什么！" 她轻声笑着，尽力摆出军人和安全人员的姿态，却失败得一塌糊涂。她的笑声让这位年轻的驾驶员那天第一次露出了微笑。

"Maybe some other time, like after I've lived a full life and I'm ready to die! I'm pretty sure that Asuka would kill me if I even thought about telling her that!" he laughed softly in reply. Heidi continued to giggle before she ruffled his hair and took her leave.  
"也许改天吧，比如在我过完充实的一生，准备好去死的时候！我很确定如果我敢告诉明日香，她会杀了我的！" 他轻声笑着回应。海蒂继续笑着，揉了揉他的头发，然后离开了。

"Okay, folks! I'm not one for teary goodbyes," Asuka and Misato snorted as Shinji smiled sadly, "So I'll see you later! Take care!" With that, the fiery redhead that had invaded their home for the summer and had brought about some much needed healing, turned and walked through the gates to the waiting transport.  
"好了，各位！我不擅长泪眼汪汪的告别，" 明日香和美里嗤之以鼻，而真嗣则苦笑着说，"所以回头见！保重！" 就这样，那个在夏天闯入他们家并带来急需治愈的火红发女孩，转身穿过大门，走向等候的交通工具。

"You two stay here while I go get the car," Misato said as she began to walk toward the doors and out to the parking lot, "It's probably going to take a while to get the car out, so you can stay here and watch her plane take off. Now, don't do anything I wouldn't do while I'm gone!" With a wink, a giggle, and a swish of her hips, Misato spun and walked out the door before her two charges could come back with any sort of comeback.  
"你们俩留在这儿，我去取车，" 美里说着开始向门口走去，前往停车场，"可能要花点时间把车开出来，你们可以留在这里看她的飞机起飞。现在，别做我不在时不会做的事！" 眨眼、轻笑、扭臀，美里转身走出门口，没等她的两个孩子回嘴。

"Humph! What _wouldn't_ she do?" Asuka fumed, angry she couldn't snap back at her guardian, who was now a pretty good distance away. How she could move so fast in those heels, Asuka could never figure out.  
"哼！她有什么不敢做的？" 明日香气愤地说，恼火自己无法回击已经走远不少的监护人。她怎么能穿着高跟鞋走得这么快，明日香永远也想不明白。

"No telling," Shinji commented as he leaned against the rail that overlooked the tarmac, only it and a thin sheet of bulletproof glass between him and a three story fall. He stared out the window and watched as a redhead in a black NERV uniform climbed the steps that lead into the nearest military personnel transport.  
"说不准，" 真嗣靠在俯瞰停机坪的栏杆上，只有栏杆和一层薄薄的防弹玻璃隔在他和三层楼高的坠落之间。他凝视着窗外，看着一个红发女孩穿着黑色 NERV 制服，爬上通往最近军用人员运输机的台阶。

"Shinji," he heard Asuka call out to him much more softly than usual. This puzzled him a bit as he turned around.  
"真嗣，" 他听到明日香比平时更柔和地呼唤他。这让他有些困惑，当他转过身来。

"Yes, Asuka?" he asked as he turned around, seeing the look on her face, as her mask fell once more, revealing the young girl beneath the hard exterior. Shinji was shocked as his friend came forward and slid her arms through his and around his waist, planting her head on his shoulder.  
"什么事，明日香？" 他转过身来问道，看到她脸上的表情，她的面具再次落下，露出了坚硬外表下的年轻女孩。真嗣震惊地看着他的朋友走上前来，将双臂穿过他的手臂，环抱住他的腰，将头靠在他的肩膀上。

"Thank you," she whispered softly in his ear, causing Shinji's face to turn red as a shiver ran down his spine. He did the unthinkable and responded to her hug by wrapping his own arms around her and embraced her back. "Thank you for bringing my auntie to me. She told me everything. I know I don't thank you for everything that you do, but I really do appreciate it. I can't promise that I won't be a bitch to you like I usually am, but I will try to be better. Just don't stop being the sweet guy you always are, okay?"  
"谢谢你，" 她在他耳边轻声细语，让真嗣的脸颊泛起红晕，一阵寒颤沿着脊背而下。他做出了不可思议的举动，回应她的拥抱，用双臂环抱住她，回以拥抱。"谢谢你带我阿姨来见我。她告诉我一切。我知道我没有为你的所有付出表示感谢，但我真的很感激。我不能保证我不会像平时那样对你刻薄，但我会努力变得更好。只是请你不要停止做那个一直以来的温柔男孩，好吗？"

"As you wish, Asuka," he replied, not too sure where he got that from, but it may have had something to do with a movie Heidi kept watching about some sort of pirate and his friends. His breath caught in his throat, at the next thing Asuka whispered to him.  
"如你所愿，明日香，" 他回答道，不太确定这句话从何而来，但可能与海蒂一直在看的某部关于海盗和他的朋友的电影有关。他的呼吸一窒，因为明日香接下来在他耳边低语。

"I forgive you."

"Thank you, Asuka," he whispered as he did his best to check his emotions. He felt like crying, feeling a huge weight being lifted from his heart. Asuka had finally forgiven him. It sent a huge shot of warmth and courage flowing through his body. It was right then he decided to follow some advise he had just been given to him by a dear friend. "Asuka, I need to tell you something…"  
"谢谢你，明日香，" 他低声说道，尽力控制自己的情绪。他感觉像是要哭出来，心中沉重的负担被卸下了。明日香终于原谅了他。这股巨大的温暖和勇气涌遍全身。就在那时，他决定听从一位挚友刚刚给他的建议。"明日香，我有些话要告诉你……"

"Yeah, Shinji?" Asuka asked, leaning back some to look into his eyes, eyes that she could get lost in if she wasn't careful. As everyone knew, Asuka was _always_ careful. Not. She wondered if he finally had gotten the courage to tell her what he felt. "What?" she continued softly.  
"嗯，真嗣？" 明日香问道，稍微向后仰了仰，以便直视他的眼睛，那些眼睛如果她不小心的话，她可能会迷失其中。众所周知，明日香总是小心翼翼。才怪。她想知道他是否终于鼓起勇气告诉她他的感受。"什么？" 她继续温柔地问道。

_"Oh, hell, I can't do this! She just now forgave me! What the hell am I thinking?!"_ Shinji thought to himself as he stared back at the object of his affection. "Uh, it's nothing! Don't worry about it." He watched as Asuka's smile turned into a familiar smirk as her eyes narrowed for just the tiniest fraction of a second.  
"哦，该死，我做不到！她刚刚才原谅我！我到底在想什么？！" 真嗣心里想着，同时回望着他心爱的人。"呃，没什么！别担心。" 他看着明日香的微笑变成了熟悉的讥笑，她的眼睛微微眯了一下。

"Sure, whatever, Shinji," she replied in her normal tone of voice as she pulled back somewhat, only to discover that Shinji really didn't want to let her go. She smirked some more. "I guess we need to go, Ikari, before anyone sees us and thinks that you reached over and grabbed me! Everyone will then know what kind of pervert you really are!"  
"当然，随便你，真嗣，" 她用平常的语气回答，同时稍微往后退了一些，却发现真嗣真的不想让她离开。她又笑了笑。"我想我们得走了，碇，不然有人看到我们，会以为你伸手抓住了我！那样所有人都会知道你到底是个什么样的变态！"

"What?!" he barked as he reluctantly began to release his hold on the redhead, " If I remember correctly, you are the one who grabbed me first! Perv!" he teased back, surprising Asuka somewhat before she shot back her reply.  
"什么？！" 他咆哮着，不情愿地开始松开对红发女孩的束缚，"如果我没记错，是你先抓住我的！变态！" 他调侃回去，让明日香有些惊讶，随即她反击道。

"Yeah, right! Like anyone would believe that! I swear, if you tell anyone about what just happened, I'll shove my EVA's foot so far up your ass you'll never be able to sit in an entry plug again!" Asuka warned as she and the pilot of Unit One finally released their hug.  
"得了吧！谁会信啊！我发誓，如果你敢告诉任何人刚才的事，我就用 EVA 的脚把你踹得再也坐不进插入栓！" 明日香警告道，她和初号机的驾驶员终于松开了拥抱。

"As you wish, Asuka," Shinji replied once more, drawing a strange look from his room mate.  
"如你所愿，明日香，" 真嗣再次回答，这让他的室友投来奇怪的目光。

"Is that going to be your standard answer from now on, instead of 'sorry'?" she barked as she turned to head out the door. Misato managed to get back quicker than they had expected, and was waiting for them at the curb.  
"那以后这就是你的标准回答了，而不是'对不起'？" 她厉声说道，转身向门口走去。美里比他们预想的更快回来，已经在路边等着他们了。

"Perhaps," Shinji answered back as he followed Asuka out the door toward the car. He didn't see the small smile on her face, or the small blush on her cheeks as she muttered one single word softly as she climbed into the front seat.  
"或许吧，" 真嗣回答着，跟着明日香出门走向汽车。他没有看到她脸上那抹淡淡的微笑，以及她爬进前座时脸颊上微微的红晕，她轻声嘀咕了一个词。

"Good!"

---
School started days later, and much to their relief, all their friends came back for their first year of High School. Despite all the time the pilots had missed, all four had been promoted to the next grade, on urgings from NERV, of course. Asuka quickly fell back into her previous school behavior: namely acting as if she were God's gift to everyone. Shinji could only smile and see that as a sign of his friend's continuing recovery. Touji came back, not nearly as chipper as he once was, but a certain class rep had helped over the summer, and the two now seemed inseparable, despite Touji still trying to retain a cool image for himself.  
几天后学校开学了，令他们欣慰的是，所有朋友都回来了，开始了他们的高中第一年。尽管驾驶员们错过了很多时间，但在 NERV 的强烈要求下，四人都被提升到了下一个年级。明日香很快就恢复了她以往的学校行为：即表现得像是上帝赐予每个人的礼物。真嗣只能微笑着，将其视为朋友继续康复的迹象。剑介也回来了，不再像以前那样活泼，但某位班长在暑假期间给予了帮助，两人现在似乎形影不离，尽管剑介仍在努力保持自己的酷形象。

Rei came back, and much to everyone's surprise, she seemed much more animated than before, which in her case meant that she actually tried to smile a time or two at her friend's jokes. Shinji would shake his head and chuckle as his sister did what she could to try to fit in and act like a 'regular girl'. Shinji had to remind her that she was a very remarkable girl indeed, and that she should take her time in learning how to fit in. She would always smile and thank Shinji for his concern, stating that he was a 'good big brother' which always made him blush. Rei loved to see him blush.  
丽回来了，令众人惊讶的是，她似乎比以前更加活泼了，对她而言，这意味着她真的尝试着对朋友的笑话笑上一两次。真嗣会摇摇头轻笑，看着妹妹尽力融入并表现得像个“普通女孩”。真嗣不得不提醒她，她确实是一个非常特别的女孩，应该慢慢学习如何融入。她总是微笑着感谢真嗣的关心，称他为“好哥哥”，这总让他脸红。丽喜欢看他脸红的样子。

As for Shinji himself, he tried his best to follow Heidi's advise, but the hurt and pain had scarred him deeply, and wounds like that are hard to heal. He was always there for his friends though, whether it was words of encouragement to Touji or Rei, or watching Kensuke's back whenever the school bullies thought it was a good idea to try to beat up the young otaku. Whenever he saw the blackness try to creep up on Asuka again, which was happening less and less, he would send her a teasing message over their laptops, just to get a rise out of her, or send a file full of cello music to her to listen to. She would always glance back and give him a silent 'thank you'.  
至于真嗣本人，他尽力遵循海蒂的建议，但伤害与痛苦已在他心中留下深深的烙痕，那样的创伤难以愈合。尽管如此，他始终陪伴在朋友们身边，无论是给予剑介或丽鼓励的话语，还是在校园恶霸试图欺负年轻的御宅族健介时，默默守护在他身后。每当他察觉到黑暗再次悄悄侵袭明日香，虽然这种情况越来越少，他便会通过笔记本电脑给她发送挑逗性的消息，只为激起她的反应，或是传送一整份大提琴音乐文件让她聆听。她总会回头瞥一眼，无声地向他道谢。

Things back at NERV were progressing much slower than things at school were, however. The process of regenerating Unit Zero was going so much slower than anyone had planned, mainly due to the fact that so much of the recovered material had been corrupted by the Angel's DNA. The only truly viable part that had been recovered had been the head, so the growth process was slow. The biggest hassle was going to be finding a suitable human soul to inhabit and animate the EVA. The biggest reason that Rei had ever had problems linking up with Unit Zero was because the soul that animated it was the same one that had sent Rei's first body to the grave. The elder Dr. Akagi hated Rei with a passion, and it was Rei's Angelic side that finally seemed to override her EVA's hesitation to accept her.  
然而，NERV 总部的事务进展远比学校里缓慢得多。零号机的再生进程比任何人预想的都要慢，主要原因是回收的材料中有太多被使徒的 DNA 污染了。唯一真正可用的部分是头部，因此生长过程缓慢。最大的难题将是找到一个合适的人类灵魂来居住并驱动 EVA。零号机与绫波丽连接不畅的主要原因在于，驱动它的灵魂正是导致绫波丽第一具身体消亡的那个。老碇博士对绫波丽怀有深切的恨意，而最终似乎是绫波丽的使徒特质压过了 EVA 对她的犹豫，使其接受了她。

Asuka had other problems, unfortunately. It seemed that each and every time she sat in Unit Two's entry plug, or even in a test plug of some sort, images of her battles with the Fifteenth and Sixteenth would come flooding back to haunt her. Her sync ratio finally made it over the borderline to activate her EVA, but just barely. Just as the borderline was breached, it was like she was attacked once more by the Angels, promptly causing the EVA to disconnect from her. Asuka's frustrations mounted more and more every time it happened, and Shinji worked feverishly to keep her from falling back into the abyss that had claimed her months earlier. Shinji finally came up with an idea after some discussion from a recently returned Kaji. Kaji had gotten some information for him concerning the event that lead to both Kyoko's and his mother's accidents. He only hoped he would survive what was to come.  
不幸的是，明日香还有其他问题。似乎每次她坐进二号机的插入栓，或是某种测试栓时，与第十五、十六使徒战斗的画面就会涌入脑海，挥之不去。她的同步率终于勉强越过了激活 EVA 的临界线，但仅此而已。就在突破临界线的那一刻，仿佛再次遭到使徒的攻击，随即导致 EVA 与她断开连接。每次发生这种情况，明日香的挫败感都愈发强烈，而真嗣则拼命努力，防止她再次坠入几个月前吞噬她的深渊。在与刚回来的加持进行一番讨论后，真嗣终于想出了一个主意。加持为他提供了一些信息，关于导致绫波和母亲事故的事件。他只希望自己能挺过即将到来的考验。

_Christmas, 2016_

Asuka was miserable as she sat in the waiting room just outside the EVA bays. Christmas time was always difficult for her, especially since she had come to Japan. Last Christmas was just completely horrible, seeing how she had been in a self-induced coma at the time. Everything that had lead up to Christmas had been overshadowed by the Angel attacks, destroying what little happiness she could get from the holiday season. Since the death of her mother, Christmas had lost a lot of it's luster, but she could still hold on to a few cherished memories from the times she spent with her Aunt and Grandmother. Now, however, those memories were completely overshadowed by her pain and failure.  
明日香坐在 EVA 机库外的等候室里，感到无比痛苦。圣诞节对她来说总是艰难的，尤其是来到日本之后。去年的圣诞节简直糟糕透顶，那时她正处于自我诱发的昏迷中。一切导致圣诞节的事件都被使徒袭击所掩盖，摧毁了她从节日中能获得的些许快乐。自从母亲去世后，圣诞节失去了很多光彩，但她仍能保留一些与姨妈和祖母共度的珍贵记忆。然而，现在这些记忆完全被她的痛苦和失败所掩盖。

"Asuka? Are you okay?" Shinji asked as he watched his friend suddenly jerk from whatever spell she had been under and snap her head around to him, a snarl marring her young face.  
“明日香？你还好吗？”真嗣问道，他看到朋友突然从恍惚中惊醒，猛地转头看向他，年轻的脸上带着怒容。

"Huh? Of course I'm okay, you idiot!" she snapped at him, her face matching the color of her plugsuit. She was embarrassed that he had seen her space out.  
“哈？当然没事，你这个白痴！”她冲他吼道，脸色与她的驾驶服一样红。她因为被他看到自己走神而感到尴尬。

"Oh, okay. It just seemed like you were nervous or something," he replied kindly as he felt his sister reach over and pat his hand. Rei was suited up and sitting next to him, a small smile on her face. Unit Zero wasn't near finished yet, but Dr. Akagi still had her suit up and try to sync up with the EVA, hoping to make some sort of connection that would allow the EVA to activate. He could feel the slight tremble in her hand, that being the only outward sign of her nervousness. Since she had stopped taking the medications that suppressed her humanity, her emotions began to grow and evolve. Right now, unfortunately, she was feeling fear for the first time, the fear of becoming one with the huge life-form known as EVA. Shinji patted her hand back and gave her a reassuring smile.  
“哦，好吧。只是刚才看起来你好像很紧张似的。”他温和地回答，感觉到妹妹伸手过来轻拍他的手。丽已经穿上了驾驶服，坐在他旁边，脸上带着淡淡的微笑。零号机还未完全修复，但赤木博士仍让她穿上驾驶服尝试与 EVA 同步，希望能建立某种联系以激活 EVA。他能感觉到她手上的轻微颤抖，这是她紧张的唯一外在表现。自从她停止服用抑制人性的药物后，她的情感开始增长和变化。不幸的是，此刻她第一次感受到了恐惧，对与被称为 EVA 的巨大生命体合为一体的恐惧。真嗣回拍她的手，给了她一个鼓励的微笑。

"I mean, why the hell should I be nervous? I can't seem to sync up with my EVA properly, putting everybody in danger," Asuka muttered to herself. "If this doesn't work, they're going to probably kick me out of NERV and send me back to Germany as a failure! I don't think I could handle that! My life would be meaningless." Shinji looked at her sadly before The Man walked up and handed him a folder titled _Operation: Phoenix_. Shinji set his jaw and turned to Rei, whispering in her ear.  
"我的意思是，我他妈为什么要紧张？我似乎无法与我的 EVA 同步，这把大家都置于危险之中，" 明日香自言自语道。"如果这不行，他们很可能会把我踢出 NERV，送我回德国，当作一个失败者！我无法承受那种结果！我的生活将毫无意义。" 真嗣悲伤地看着她，这时碇司令走过来递给他一个标有“凤凰行动”的文件夹。真嗣紧咬牙关，转向绫波，在她耳边低语。

"Rei, I'm about to tell Asuka something that may just result in injury to myself. Whatever you do, please don't interfere, okay?" he asked her softly. She looked at him, confused.  
"绫波，我即将告诉明日香一些可能会让我受伤的事情。无论发生什么，请不要插手，好吗？" 他轻声请求她。她看着他，面露困惑。

"Why?" she whispered back, concern for her brother evident in her voice.  
"为什么？" 她低声回问，声音中明显流露出对兄长的关切。

"It's to help Asuka. Trust me, okay?" Shinji reassured her as he gave her a quick hug. Asuka looked over and snorted in disgust. Having no family close by, she was a bit jealous at seeing Shinji and Rei together.  
"这是为了帮助明日香。相信我，好吗？" 真嗣安慰她，并给了她一个快速的拥抱。明日香瞥了一眼，厌恶地哼了一声。由于身边没有家人，看到真嗣和绫波在一起，她感到有些嫉妒。

"What the hell are you two whispering about?" she snarled, her bright blue eyes casting daggers at their direction. "Plotting ways to get rid of me, perhaps?" She was shocked when Shinji got up and took a seat next to her.  
"你们俩在嘀咕什么鬼东西？" 她咆哮道，明亮的蓝眼睛向他们投去锐利的目光。"是在密谋怎么甩掉我吗？" 当真嗣站起来坐在她旁边时，她感到震惊。

"No, Asuka, I was just telling her everything would be alright," Shinji said as he looked into the redhead's eyes, "She's still nervous about crawling back into an EVA, that's all."  
"不，明日香，我只是告诉她一切都会好起来的，" 真嗣看着红发女孩的眼睛说，"她只是对再次爬进 EVA 感到紧张，仅此而已。"

"Join the crowd," Asuka mumbled as she leaned forward on her elbows, her head bowed in a moment of weakness. Her hair covered the face, keeping everyone from seeing the expression on her face. "I can't even get my EVA to move, let alone operate in combat." Shinji nodded to himself and braced himself for the pain. He knew he was about to follow the correct, albeit painful, path.  
"加入这个群体吧，" 明日香喃喃自语，她向前倾靠在肘部，头低垂着，显露出片刻的脆弱。她的头发遮住了脸庞，不让任何人看到她的表情。"我连 EVA 都动不了，更别提在战斗中操作了。" 真嗣默默点头，为自己即将承受的痛苦做好准备。他知道，尽管这条路痛苦，但却是正确的。

"Asuka," he began, searching for the right words, "I've told you before about how my mother died, right?" Asuka looked up and stared at him questioningly, wondering why he was bringing that up at a time like this. She nodded her head before he continued.  
"明日香，" 他开口道，寻找着合适的词句，"我之前跟你提过我母亲是怎么去世的，对吧？" 明日香抬起头，疑惑地盯着他，不明白为什么他会在这种时候提起这件事。她点点头，示意他继续说下去。

"Yeah, something about a contact experiment with Unit One, right?" Shinji nodded in agreement.  
"对，是关于零号机的一次接触实验，对吧？" 真嗣点头表示同意。

"She was absorbed by the EVA, just like I was during the battle with the Fourteenth. Only, she was never recovered. I know it sound kind of crazy, but I swear there are times I can feel her inside the entry plug. It's kinda like she's watching over me, you know?" Asuka continued to look at him like he had screw loose. "I think that's why it goes into Berserker mode, sometimes. It's trying to protect me!"  
"她被 EVA 吞噬了，就像我在与第十四使徒战斗时那样。只不过，她再也没有被找回来。我知道这听起来有点疯狂，但我发誓，有时候我能感觉到她在插入栓里。就像是她在守护着我，你懂吗？" 明日香继续盯着他，仿佛他脑子出了问题。"我想这就是为什么 EVA 有时会进入狂暴模式的原因。它在试图保护我！"

"Okay," Asuka responded slowly, her eyes narrowing at her fellow pilot, "just what the hell are you getting at? Why are you telling me this now, huh?" She watched Shinji take a big breath before he spoke once more.  
"好吧，" 明日香缓缓回应，目光锐利地盯着她的同伴驾驶员，"你到底想说什么？为什么现在告诉我这些，嗯？" 她看着真嗣深吸一口气，然后再次开口。

"Uh, well, remember what you told me about your mother? About what happened to her after her contact experiment with Unit Two?" he swallowed nervously. Shinji saw the fire flare up in Asuka's eyes.  
"呃，那个，记得你告诉过我关于你母亲的事吗？关于她和二号机接触实验后发生的事？" 他紧张地咽了咽口水。真嗣看到明日香眼中的怒火燃起。

"No…"she hissed through gritted teeth, as Shinji continued on.  
"不…"她咬牙切齿地低声说道，而真嗣继续说着。

"What if…"

"Shut up!" she commanded, her fists clinched and trembling with rage.  
"闭嘴！"她命令道，双拳紧握，因愤怒而颤抖。

"…somehow, some part of her…"  
"…不知为何，她内心的一部分…"

"Stop it, you son of a bitch…"she growled even louder, but Shinji refused to stop.  
"住手，你这个混蛋……"她咆哮得更响了，但真嗣拒绝停下来。

"…bonded with the EVA, acting as it's soul…"  
"……与 EVA 结合，作为它的灵魂……"

"Ikari, you better…" Asuka seethed, her patience coming to it's limit. Shinji continued, knowing what was to come.  
"碇，你最好……"明日香咬牙切齿，耐心已到极限。真嗣继续着，知道接下来会发生什么。

"What if she's in there with you every time?"  
"如果她每次都在你身边呢？"

"SHUT THE HELL UP!!" Asuka screamed as she shot up and stood before the Third Child. He saw what was coming and refused to move.  
""闭嘴！！"" 明日香尖叫着跳起来，站在第三适格者面前。他看到了即将发生的事，却拒绝移动。

_SLAP_! Asuka backhanded Shinji across the face as hard as she could, sending the young man sprawling across the room and landing in a heap. The redhead was on him in an instant, kicking him in the side. Rei made to get up to help her brother when Shinji turned to her.  
啪！明日香狠狠地反手扇了真嗣一巴掌，将他打得横飞出去，摔成一团。红发少女立刻扑向他，踢向他的侧身。绫波零正要起身帮助她的兄弟时，真嗣转向了她。

"Rei! No! Stay out of this!" he pleaded as Asuka squatted down and grabbed him by his collar, bringing him close to her face.  
“丽！不！别掺和进来！”他恳求道，而明日香蹲下身，抓住他的衣领，将他拉近自己的脸庞。

"Don't you EVER talk about my mother again, you hear me, Ikari?!" Asuka spat in his face in anger. The Coward tried to show his face, but The Man gave him a roundhouse kick that sent him back to the shadows. Shinji gulped as he tasted the blood in his mouth before continuing.  
“你再敢提我母亲，听到了吗，碇？！”明日香愤怒地朝他脸上吐口水。懦夫试图露面，但男子给了他一记回旋踢，将他踢回了阴影中。真嗣咽了咽，尝到了嘴里的血腥味，然后继续说道。

"Asuka, listen! " she slapped him again, but he fought onward, "She's the soul that activates the EVA!" Asuka punched him in the stomach, causing him to lose his breath.  
“明日香，听我说！”她再次扇了他一巴掌，但他继续坚持，“她是激活 EVA 的灵魂！”明日香一拳打在他的肚子上，让他喘不过气来。

"I said shut up! " she snarled once more as she pulled him to his feet, looking into his bruised face. His eyes continued to lock onto hers.  
“我说闭嘴！”她再次咆哮着将他拽起身，目光落在他淤青的脸上。他的双眼依旧紧盯着她。

"You need to accept it, Asuka…AAARGH!" Shinji moaned as the Second Child kneed him in the groin, doubling him over. He refused to give up. "You have to open you heart and mind to her if you want to activate the EVA properly." At this, Asuka began to beat him mercilessly, slapping and punching him, releasing all her rage and frustrations on the young man who refused to raise a hand to defend himself. Once he fell to the floor, she began to kick him, screaming and raging the whole time. Finally, her anger spent, she stood before the battered form of her fellow pilot, glaring down at him. She heard muffled crying coming from behind her, turning around she saw Rei standing, her hands covering her mouth and tears pouring down her face. A sudden realization hit her of what she had just done, and she cursed herself for losing control. She looked back down at Shinji, the horror of what she had done slowly sank in. She had attacked her friend and fellow pilot. She wouldn't blame them if NERV kicked her out and her friends disowned her. Her world had finally fallen apart.  
"你得接受它，明日香……啊啊啊！" 真嗣呻吟着，被二号机驾驶员一膝盖顶中下体，疼得弯下了腰。他仍不愿放弃，"要想正确启动 EVA，你必须敞开心扉，接纳她。" 听到这话，明日香开始无情地殴打他，扇耳光、挥拳相向，将所有怒火与压抑发泄在这个不愿还手的年轻人身上。当他倒地后，她又继续踢打，全程尖叫怒吼。最终，怒气消散，她站在遍体鳞伤的同伴面前，怒目而视。她听到身后传来压抑的哭泣声，转身发现丽站在那里，双手捂嘴，泪流满面。一个突如其来的认知击中了她：她刚刚做了什么。她痛骂自己失控。再看向真嗣，她对自己行为的恐惧逐渐加深。她攻击了自己的朋友和搭档。如果 NERV 将她除名，朋友们与她断绝关系，她也不会怪他们。她的世界终于彻底崩塌了。

"What the HELL is going on here?!" Misato demanded as the door to the room flew open, revealing a very angry Major. "Asuka? What the hell did you do to Shinji?"  
"这到底是怎么回事？！" 美里怒气冲冲地推开门，露出了极为愤怒的少校。"明日香？你对真嗣做了什么？"

"Misato, I…uh…" Asuka began, knowing that it was over, everything was lost.  
"美里，我……呃……" 明日香开口道，知道一切都完了，一切都失去了。

"I tripped, Misato," Shinji spoke up as he pulled himself up from the floor, his face covered in bruises and cuts. "Asuka was try to help me up, just now," he said as he held out his hand, which Asuka quickly reached out and grabbed, pulling him up the rest of the way.  
"我摔倒了，美里，" 真嗣一边从地板上爬起来，一边说道，他的脸上布满了瘀伤和划痕。"明日香刚才正试图扶我起来，" 他说着伸出手，明日香迅速抓住，将他拉了起来。

"You tripped?" Misato snarled, her arms crossed as she continued to glare at Asuka.  
"你摔倒了？" 美里咆哮道，双臂交叉，继续瞪着明日香。

"Yeah, over my own two feet. Clumsy me!" he laughed, putting his hand behind his head and wincing somewhat. Rei made a move to go to her brother before a look from Shinji stopped her.  
"是啊，被自己的两只脚绊倒了。我真是笨手笨脚！" 他笑着，把手放在脑后，略显痛苦地皱了皱眉。绫波想要走向她的哥哥，但真嗣的一个眼神阻止了她。

"Really?," Misato replied, clearly not convinced, especially since she saw the whole thing on the monitors in the lab. Turning to the blue-haired girl with puffy red eyes, Misato interrogated Rei. "Rei, is that true? Did Shinji trip over his own two feet?"  
"真的吗？" 美里回答，显然并不相信，尤其是在实验室的监视器上看到了整个过程。她转向那位蓝发红肿眼睛的女孩，质问绫波。"绫波，这是真的吗？真嗣是被自己的两只脚绊倒的吗？"

"Uh," Rei began, as she turned to Shinji, who nodded his head ever so slightly, "yes, Shinji was quite clumsy, Major." Misato's jaw dropped. She never expected Rei to flat out lie to her.  
"呃，" 丽开始说道，转向真嗣，后者微微点头，"是的，真嗣相当笨拙，少校。" 美里目瞪口呆。她从未料到丽会直接对她撒谎。

"I don't know what the hell is going on here, but I WILL get to the bottom of it later!" Misato seethed as she glared at all three pilots, who unconsciously huddled together in an act of unity and self-preservation. "Alright, you three, fall out for your tests!" Misato spun on her heel and stormed out of the room.  
"我不知道这里到底发生了什么，但我稍后一定会查个水落石出！" 美里怒视着三位驾驶员，他们无意识地聚在一起，表现出团结和自我保护的姿态。"好了，你们三个，去进行测试吧！" 美里转身，怒气冲冲地离开了房间。

"Shinji, I…uh," Asuka began to stammer, but she was cut off as Rei deliberately got between her and the pilot of Unit One. Rei sent a glare to the stricken redhead as she reached out and took her brother by the arm and lead him out of the room and towards the EVA bays. Asuka was taken aback somewhat by the blue-haired girl's behavior, but Asuka knew that she deserved whatever anger was directed at her.  
"真嗣，我…呃，" 明日香开始结巴，但被丽故意挡在她和初号机驾驶员之间打断了。丽向受惊的红发少女投去一瞥，然后伸出手抓住她的兄弟，带他离开了房间，朝 EVA 机库走去。明日香对蓝发女孩的行为有些惊讶，但她知道，无论对方对她有什么怒气，都是她应得的。

--

Asuka always hated the taste of LCL. She could never really place the taste before until Shinji made a comment one day about it tasting and smelling like blood. Now, the taste made her want to gag, but she pulled her thoughts away from the taste and concentrated on trying to get her EVA to move. The start up sequence went as planned, as Asuka sank back into the mental state needed to sync with the huge artificial bio-form. However, no sooner had the borderline been breached then the memories once more reached out and assaulted her. She tried as hard as she could to hold them back, to fight with everything she was worth, but it was to no avail. Her EVA promptly shut back down, leaving her alone in her entry plug with nothing but the emergency lights to keep her occupied. She was at her wits end as she continued to sit there and try to fight back the tears that were trying to force their way from her eyes.  
明日香一直讨厌 LCL 的味道。她以前从未真正能描述出这种味道，直到有一天真嗣评论说它尝起来和闻起来都像血。现在，这味道让她想吐，但她强迫自己不去想它，集中精力试图让她的 EVA 动起来。启动序列按计划进行，明日香沉入与巨大人造生物体同步所需的精神状态。然而，边界刚一被突破，记忆就再次伸出并攻击她。她竭尽全力试图阻挡它们，拼尽全力抵抗，但无济于事。她的 EVA 立刻关闭，留下她独自一人在插入栓里，只有应急灯陪伴。她已经到了崩溃的边缘，坐在那里继续试图抑制住试图从眼中涌出的泪水。

"Contact re-established," she heard the voice of Maya Ibuki call out over the com channel as the power once more flowed into the entry plug.  
“重新建立联系，”她听到伊吹玛雅的声音在通讯频道中响起，电源再次流入插入栓。

"Is she still in there?" the voice of Dr. Akagi called out over the open mike, causing Asuka's anger to flare.  
“她还在里面吗？”赤城博士的声音通过麦克风传来，激起了明日香的愤怒。

"Yeah, I'm still here," she barked back as she glared into her video screens at the faux blonde, "for all that's worth," she muttered softly.  
"是啊，我还在这儿，"她对着视频屏幕中的假金发女郎怒目而视，回呛道，"尽管这没什么意义，"她轻声嘀咕着。

"Okay, we'll try again in a few minutes, Asuka," Dr. Akagi said as she turned back to Maya. "If she doesn't make it next time, we'll have to drop her from the combat rolls, and maybe even the entire program!"  
"好吧，我们几分钟后再次尝试，明日香，"赤城博士转头对真希说，"如果她下次还不行，我们就得把她从战斗序列中除名，甚至可能整个项目都要放弃！"

"I can still hear you, you know!" Asuka yelled into the com line, her anger and fear taking on unheard of dimensions. "I'll show you! I'll prove who's the best pilot!" Inside, Asuka wanted to curl up in a ball and die.  
"我知道你们还在听！"明日香对着通讯线路大喊，她的愤怒和恐惧达到了前所未有的程度，"我会证明给你们看！谁才是最优秀的飞行员！"内心深处，明日香只想蜷缩成一团，死去。

"Oops!" Maya chirped as she quickly cut the feed to the control room. Asuka fumed as she turned and watched her fellow pilots over the view screens. Rei still was making absolutely no head way with Unit Zero, while Shinji's sync level showed him at a good seventy-four percent.  
"哎呀！" 真嗣轻快地切断了与指挥室的通讯。明日香怒气冲冲地转过身，通过监视屏观察着其他驾驶员。绫波丽依然在与零号机上毫无进展，而真嗣的同步率显示他达到了不错的 74%。

"Shinji," Asuka croaked, still feeling awful whenever she saw the bruises and cuts on his face. One eye was almost swollen shut, and his lip was split, but he managed to look back at her with a small smile on his face.  
"真嗣，" 明日香嘶哑地开口，每次看到他脸上的瘀伤和划痕都让她感到难受。一只眼睛几乎肿得睁不开，嘴唇也裂开了，但他还是努力回望着她，脸上带着一丝微笑。

"Hey Asuka, you okay?" Shinji asked, concern clearly evident in his eyes. He watched as she seemed to tremble somewhat, biting her lower lips.  
"嘿，明日香，你还好吗？" 真嗣问道，眼中的关切显而易见。他看着她似乎有些颤抖，咬着下唇。

"Well, it looks like you're going to end up being the Number One pilot after all," she managed to say past the lump that was growing in her throat, "If I can't get this thing to work on the next try, they're going to kick me out!" Shinji thought he heard a small sob, but with the distortion created by the LCL, he couldn't be sure.  
"好吧，看来你终究还是要成为一号机驾驶员了，"她勉强说道，喉咙里那块东西越来越大，"如果下次我还不能让这东西启动，他们就会把我踢出去！" 真嗣觉得他听到了一声轻微的抽泣，但由于 LCL 造成的扭曲，他无法确定。

"Asuka, please, I know it sounds far-fetched, but please give my idea a try! I don't want to see you leave! All you have to do is open your mind up to the EVA!" Shinji implored as a flicker of doubt flashed across Asuka's eyes.  
"明日香，请听我说，我知道这听起来很离谱，但请试试我的想法！我不想看到你离开！你只需要向 EVA 敞开心扉！" 真嗣恳求道，明日香眼中闪过一丝疑虑。

"You know," Asuka snorted, "that sounds an awful lot like what Rei told me last year!"  
"你知道吗，"明日香嗤之以鼻，"这听起来很像去年绫波跟我说的话！"

"The same holds true now as it did then, Soryu," Rei responded over the line, angering Asuka a bit. She didn't realize that the line to Unit Zero was open. Before Asuka could yell back at his sister, Shinji spoke up.  
"索伦如今所言，与当时无异，丽回应道，这让明日香有些恼火。她没意识到零号机的通讯线路是开着的。在明日香能回怼她姐姐之前，真嗣开口了。

"Asuka, I really think it will work, just watch my ratio the next few minutes and see, okay? Please?" Asuka rolled her eyes, but silently nodded her head in agreement.  
"明日香，我真的觉得这会有效，就观察我接下来几分钟的表现，好吗？求你了？" 明日香翻了个白眼，但还是默默点头同意了。

"_Okay, mother, if we're going to do this, we really need to do it now! Asuka is counting on us_!" Shinji thought as he slowly opened the barriers to his heart and mind, feeling the warm caress of his mother's spirit pour over him and urge through the body of the EVA.  
"好吧，妈妈，如果我们打算这么做，真的需要现在就开始！明日香在指望我们！" 真嗣想着，缓缓打开心扉和思维的屏障，感受着母亲灵魂的温暖抚慰涌入他，并通过 EVA 的身体传递。

"Dr. Akagi! Shinji's sync ratio has just jumped to ninety-nine percent!" Maya called out over the com lines. Asuka's eyes bulged as she watched Shinji's ratio climb and remain steady , achieving a level Asuka could only dream about.  
"赤木博士！真嗣的同步率刚刚跳到了百分之九十九！" 美里通过通讯线路喊道。明日香瞪大了眼睛，看着真嗣的同步率攀升并保持稳定，达到了她只能梦想的水平。

"Does it show any sign of climbing any higher?!" Dr. Akagi barked nervously, fearing a repeat of the events that led to Shinji being absorbed by Unit One. Maya quickly shook her head in the negative.  
"还有继续上升的迹象吗？！" 赤木博士紧张地咆哮道，担心重演真嗣被初号机吸收的事件。美里迅速摇头表示否定。

"_My Shinji_," a soft voice called out in Shinji's head, "_My special little boy! I have missed you!_"  
"我的真嗣，" 一个温柔的声音在真嗣脑海中响起，"我特别的小男孩！我好想你！"

"_I've missed you too, Mother_!" He replied as he felt his spirit float in a sea of LCL as he was gently embraced by loving arms. He felt the warmth of his mother's smile as she looked down proudly at him.  
"我也好想你，妈妈！" 他回应着，感觉自己的灵魂在 LCL 的海洋中飘荡，被充满爱意的臂膀温柔拥抱。他感受到母亲微笑中的温暖，她骄傲地俯视着他。

"_I see you're here to help Kyoko's daughter, despite the fear you have of what happened last time_," Yui's voice said as it surrounded him, "_How that truly warms my heart! Come, we have much to discuss…,_"  
"我知道你是来帮助 Kyoko 的女儿的，尽管你害怕上次发生的事情，" Yui 的声音环绕着他，"这真的让我心暖！来吧，我们有很多要谈的……"

"Sync ratio is starting to come back down," Maya called back out after about a minute had passed, "It's leveling out to about eighty percent!"  
"同步率开始下降了，" Maya 在大约一分钟后喊道，"现在稳定在百分之八十左右！"

"Thank goodness!" Akagi exclaimed as she turned her attention back to Shinji. "Is everything alright in there, Shinji?"  
"谢天谢地！" 赤木律子转回注意力，看向真嗣。"里面一切都好吗，真嗣？"

"Everything's alright, Dr. Akagi," Shinji replied with a sad smile on his face. While only a minute had passed in real-time, several hours had passed in his mind while his mother had let him in on many secrets that had been kept from him, including the true reason for her demise. Quickly, he opened a secure line to Unit Two. "Asuka!"  
"一切都好，赤木博士，" 真嗣带着一丝苦笑回答。虽然现实中只过去了一分钟，但在他的意识里已经过去了好几个小时，他的母亲向他透露了许多被隐瞒的秘密，包括她去世的真正原因。他迅速打开与二号机的安全通讯线路。"明日香！"

"What the hell just happened, Shinji?" the redhead asked, very worried about her friend.  
"刚才到底发生了什么，真嗣？" 红发的女孩焦急地问道，非常担心她的朋友。

"Just what I said earlier, I opened myself up to the EVA," he replied, a sad look still in his eyes. "Asuka, please just try! What will you lose by doing so?" He watched as Asuka continued to bite her lip, then nod in agreement.  
"“正如我之前所说，我向 EVA 敞开了心扉，”他回答道，眼中仍带着悲伤的神情。“明日香，请尝试一下吧！这样做你又会失去什么呢？”他看着明日香继续咬着嘴唇，然后点头同意。”

"Dr. Akagi? I'm ready to give it another try!" she stated defiantly as she went about resetting her controls for a restart. She watched as the doctor looked at her dubiously, before barking orders for the restart. As the power began to build, Asuka sank back into the necessary state of mind to allow her to sync with the EVA.  
"“赤木博士？我准备好再试一次了！”她倔强地说着，开始重置控制器准备重启。她看到博士怀疑地看着她，随后下达了重启的命令。随着能量逐渐增强，明日香沉入必要的心境，以便与 EVA 同步。”

"We are now at the threshold for EVA startup!" Maya exclaimed as the borderline was breached. "We have synchronization!" Asuka felt the familiar sensations once more of being one with her EVA, but the memories began to attack her once more. In desperation, she thought back to what Shinji said.  
"“我们现在处于 EVA 启动的临界点！”玛雅兴奋地喊道，界限被突破了。“我们成功同步了！”明日香再次感受到与 EVA 合为一体的熟悉感觉，但记忆又开始攻击她。在绝望中，她回想起真嗣说过的话。”

"_Momma_?" she called out with her mind, not expecting anything to happen, as the memories of the mind rape bore down upon her. _"Momma!!"_ Suddenly, a warm feeling began to surround her as a righteous fury began to build up all around her. Just as the memories began to break through her defenses, a bloodcurdling roar was heard, and a creature of light dove from the darkness and physically attacked the memories head on. The claws and teeth of the beast tore the memories to shreds, forcing them to vanish like snowflakes on a warm spring day.  
"妈妈？" 她用心灵呼唤，并未期待任何回应，因为心灵侵犯的记忆正压迫着她。"妈妈！！" 突然，一股温暖的感觉开始包围她，正当义愤填膺的情绪在她周围积聚时。就在记忆即将突破她的防线之际，一声令人毛骨悚然的咆哮响起，一只光之生物从黑暗中俯冲而下，直接攻击那些记忆。那野兽的爪牙将记忆撕成碎片，迫使它们像春日暖阳下的雪花般消散。

"Holy shit! Dr. Akagi! The sync ratio for Unit Two have shot up to ninety-five percent and is still rising!" Maya called back out, causing numerous voices to yell out over the com line.  
"我靠！赤城医生！二号机的同步率飙升至百分之九十五，还在上升！" 真希波喊道，导致通讯线路中响起众多声音。

"What the hell is going on here?! And what the hell is that?!" the doctor asked as she watched a monitor situated next to Maya. "What is that waveform?"  
"这里到底发生了什么？！那又是什么鬼东西？！" 医生问道，同时盯着真希波旁边的一个显示器。"那波形是什么？"

"Unknown!" Makoto called back from behind the startled doctor. "It's not a normal reading!"  
"未知！" 真嗣从惊慌的医生身后喊道，"这不是正常的读数！"

"Dr. Akagi! The Magi have just listed that waveform as Type: Blue! It appears to be a remnant of the Fifteenth!" Aoba called out as soon as he got the readings back from the Magi.  
"赤木博士！MAGI 刚刚将那个波形列为类型：蓝色！它似乎是第十五使徒的残留！" 青叶一拿到 MAGI 的读数就立刻报告。

"Mental contamination?! You mean it remained dormant within Asuka all this time?" Misato screeched, her eyes ready to pop from her head.  
"精神污染？！你是说它一直在明日香体内潜伏着？" 美里尖叫道，眼睛几乎要从眼眶中瞪出来。

"Not Asuka! The EVA!" Maya replied as she watched the combined waveforms of Asuka and the EVA obliterate the Angelic remnant.  
“不是明日香！是 EVA！” 美里回答道，她看着明日香和 EVA 的联合波形彻底摧毁了使徒的残余。

"It may have been a booby trap to keep Asuka from synchronizing with her EVA ever again!" Akagi barked as she watched the readings coming from the EVA.  
“这可能是个陷阱，目的是阻止明日香再次与她的 EVA 同步！” 赤城咆哮着，注视着来自 EVA 的读数。

"Is that why the Seventeenth was able to sync with Unit Two so easily?" Misato asked as she felt like a hand of steel hand had reached into her chest and grabbed her heart. She worried for her young charge.  
“这就是为什么第十七使徒能如此轻易地与二号机同步的原因吗？” 美里问道，她感觉仿佛有一只钢铁般的手伸进了她的胸膛，紧紧抓住了她的心脏。她为她的年轻学员担忧。

"It's possible! Whatever just happened, it seems that the pilot and the EVA have managed to completely obliterate the angelic remnant!" Akagi replied, still watching the monitors.  
"有可能！无论刚刚发生了什么，似乎驾驶员和 EVA 已经彻底消灭了天使的残余！" 赤木律子回答道，仍然盯着监视器。

"Is Asuka okay?" Shinji yelled over the com-line, looking as if her were ready to tear himself from his entry plug and rush over to help the redhead. "Somebody answer me!"  
"明日香还好吗？" 真嗣在通讯线路中大喊，看起来就像是要从插入栓中挣脱出来，冲过去帮助那位红发少女。"谁来回答我！"

"I'm…I'm okay, Shinji," he heard Asuka gasp as her eyes finally opened, seemingly filled with more life than they had been for over a year. "I'm okay, now!"  
"我……我没事，真嗣，" 他听到明日香喘息着，她的眼睛终于睁开，似乎比过去一年里充满了更多的生机。"我现在没事了！"

"Sync levels are coming back down and are leveling out to around eighty-five percent," Maya called out over the din of voices that were doing their best to be heard over all others. "Pilot and EVA seem to be functioning perfectly!"  
"同步率正在下降并稳定在约百分之八十五，"玛雅在嘈杂的声浪中大声报告，"驾驶员和 EVA 运行状况良好！"

"Gee, thanks for that vote of confidence!" Asuka smirked, her eyes now closed, but a gentle smile on her face. Shinji just shook his head and chuckled slightly at his friend's words.  
"哎呀，多谢你的信任票！"明日香微微一笑，双眼紧闭，但脸上带着温和的笑容。真嗣只是摇了摇头，轻声笑了起来，回应着朋友的话。

"All traces of the foreign waveform have been obliterated," Makoto announced as he received the data back from the MAGI, "Scanners show both EVA and pilot free from Angelic influences!"  
"所有外来波形痕迹已被彻底清除，"真琴宣布，他收到了来自 MAGI 的数据反馈，"扫描显示 EVA 和驾驶员均已摆脱使徒影响！"

"Thank god," Misato muttered as she fell into the nearest chair and wiped the sweat from her brow. Her heart began to slow down to a more normal rate. She watched as Asuka continued to relax and merge with her EVA.  
“谢天谢地，”美里咕哝着，瘫坐在最近的椅子上，擦去额头的汗水。她的心跳开始放缓，恢复正常。她看着明日香继续放松，与她的 EVA 融为一体。

--

Shinji winced as he carefully pulled his shirt back on, doing his best to avoid the sore ribs on his right side. Asuka had really beaten the snot out of him, and the cold LCL of the entry plug had done nothing whatsoever to help his pain. The hot shower that he had reluctantly just left had eased the pain in his body somewhat, but getting dressed to head back home quickly reminded him of his condition.  
真嗣皱着眉，小心翼翼地穿上衬衫，尽量避开右侧疼痛的肋骨。明日香真的把他打得够呛，驾驶舱里冰冷的 LCL 液体对缓解他的疼痛毫无帮助。他刚刚不情愿地洗了个热水澡，稍微缓解了身体的疼痛，但穿衣服准备回家时，他又迅速想起了自己的状况。

"Shinji, are you well?" he heard Rei ask from the other side of the curtain that separated the two halves of the locker room. Shinji grunted before answering his sister.  
“真嗣，你还好吗？”他听到帘子另一边，更衣室分隔两半的地方，丽问道。真嗣咕哝了一声，然后回答他的妹妹。

"I'm fine, Rei! Don't worry about me," he answered back as he slowly bent over and put his shoes on. "I'll be out in a little bit, okay? I just need to rest a bit."  
"我没事，丽！别担心我，" 他一边回答，一边缓缓弯腰穿上鞋子。"我一会儿就出来，好吗？我只需要稍微休息一下。"

"If Soryu tries anything again…" Rei growled, which startled the hell out of Shinji. He had never heard his sister that angry before.  
"如果丽再尝试什么……" 丽低吼道，这让真嗣吓了一跳。他从未听过姐姐如此愤怒。

"It alright, Rei! I knew what was going to happen when I told her what I did," Shinji replied as he carefully sat down on the bench, gasping slightly as his nether regions made contact with the solid surface.  
"没事的，丽！我告诉她真相时就预料到会发生什么了，" 真嗣回答着，小心翼翼地坐在长椅上，当他的下身接触到坚硬的表面时，不禁微微喘息。

"Don't worry, First Child, I won't hurt your _precious_ Shinji," he heard Asuka snap as she came out of the showers. Shinji lowered his head and shook it slowly. He was afraid of what was about to happen on the other side of the curtain.  
"别担心，第一子，我不会伤害你珍贵的真嗣的，" 他听到明日香从淋浴间出来时厉声说道。真嗣低下头，缓缓摇了摇。他害怕即将在帘子另一边发生的事情。

"You had better not, Soryu," he heard Rei _snarl_ , "He tried to help you and you answered him with violence! I do not know what my brother sees in you!" Shinji heard Asuka gasp.  
"你最好别这样，惣流，" 他听到绫波冷冷地说，"他试图帮你，你却以暴力回应！我不知道我哥哥看上你哪一点！" 真嗣听到明日香倒吸一口气。

"Just what the hell does that mean, you stupid doll?!"  
"你这该死的玩偶，那话到底是什么意思？！"

"I am not a doll!" Rei spat back, "You are not a very nice person!"  
"我不是玩偶！" 丽反驳道，"你这人真不怎么样！"

"WHAT!? Get your ass back here, Ayanami! Ayanami!" Asuka screamed, but was answered by the slamming of the locker room door. "Little bitch!"  
"什么！？给我回来，绫波！绫波！" 明日香尖叫着，回应她的却是更衣室门的砰然关闭。"小婊子！"

"She's not a bitch, Asuka," Shinji popped back, standing up for his sister, " She may not have good control of her emotions just yet, but she's doing her best! She's just trying to look after me, that's all!" He heard Asuka huff and watched her silhouette through the screen as she sat down on the bench.  
"她不是婊子，明日香，" 真嗣挺身而出，为妹妹辩护，"她可能还不能很好地控制自己的情绪，但她已经在尽力了！她只是想照顾我，仅此而已！" 他听到明日香哼了一声，透过屏幕看到她的身影坐在长凳上。

"Yeah, yeah, I know," Asuka replied softly as she calmed down somewhat. She sat there quietly for a few moments before speaking up again. "Hey, Shinji?"  
"是啊，是啊，我知道，" 明日香轻声回答，情绪稍微平复了一些。她静静地坐在那里片刻，然后再次开口，"嘿，真嗣？"

"Yes, Asuka?" he answered, still sitting on the bench on his side. He was having trouble gathering the strength to stand.  
"什么事，明日香？" 他回应道，依然坐在长椅的另一侧。他正努力积聚起站起来的力气。

"About earlier…" she began, but Shinji cut her off.  
"关于刚才的事……" 她开始说，但真嗣打断了她。

"Don't worry about it, Asuka."  
"别担心，明日香。"

"NO! I have to!" she said loudly, "Look, I'm sorry about earlier, I know you were just trying to help."  
"不！我必须这么做！" 她大声说道，"听着，我很抱歉之前的事，我知道你只是想帮忙。"

"Did it, help I mean?" the young man asked hopefully.  
"我是说，有帮到你吗？" 年轻人满怀希望地问道。"

"Yes, it did, you big dummy! You gave me my purpose and my mother back!" she chuckled, joined quickly by Shinji. "Do me a favor?"  
"是的，确实如此，你这个大傻瓜！你给了我目标，还让我找回了妈妈！" 她轻声笑道，很快与真嗣一同笑了起来。"能帮我个忙吗？"

"Sure thing, Asuka. Whatcha need?" Shinji replied eagerly, causing his friend on the other side of the curtain to smile.  
"当然可以，明日香。你需要什么？" 真嗣热切地回答，让帘子另一边的朋友露出了微笑。

"No matter how much of a bitch I am, don't give up on me, okay?" she asked softly, causing Shinji to smile. "Just keep on being the great guy you are, okay?"  
"无论我有多么刻薄，都不要放弃我，好吗？" 她轻声问道，让真嗣露出了微笑。"就继续做你这个了不起的人，好吗？"

"As you wish, Asuka," he replied as he stood from the bench to walk to the door.  
"如你所愿，明日香，" 他回答着从长椅上站起身，走向门口。

"One more thing…" "还有一件事…"

"_Uh oh_," he thought as he paused in the doorway.  
"哎呀，" 他在门口停下脚步，心中暗想。

"If you ever tell anyone what I just said, especially your sister…" Asuka growled as Shinji saw her silhouette raise a fist and shake it.  
"如果你敢把我刚才说的话告诉任何人，尤其是你姐姐……" 明日香咆哮着，真嗣看到她的身影举起拳头摇晃着。

"I know, I know," he replied before stepping out, "Merry Christmas, Asuka!"  
"我知道，我知道，" 他回答后走了出去，"圣诞快乐，明日香！"

"Merry Christmas, Shinji….."  
"圣诞快乐，真嗣……"

--

_The Present_

"You got everything ready, Asuka?" Shinji called out from the bathroom as he gather up the rest of their toiletries and walked back into the bedroom. He watched with an amused smile as his wife was sitting on her suitcase, trying to force it down to secure it.  
"一切都准备好了吗，明日香？" 真嗣在浴室里喊道，同时收拾着剩下的洗漱用品，走回卧室。他带着一丝好笑的表情看着妻子坐在行李箱上，试图用力压下箱盖将其合上。

"I think so," she replied as she looked up and saw the look on Shinji's face. "What the hell is so funny?" Her husband began to chuckle.  
"我想是的，" 她抬头看到真嗣脸上的表情，回答道，"有什么好笑的？" 她的丈夫开始轻声笑了起来。

"Nothing, Asuka, nothing at all," he replied as walked over to the bag setting on his bed and carefully packed what he had gathered. "You know, if you hadn't bought so much this week, you'd be able to close your suitcase."  
"没什么，明日香，真的没什么，" 他边说边走到床上的包旁，小心翼翼地将收集到的东西打包好，"你知道的，如果你这周没买那么多东西，你的行李箱早就合上了。"

"Oh, shut up!" Asuka shot back as she was finally able to close the latch on the case. " I had to get a few souvenirs, you know! I didn't here you complain about that little outfit I bought the other day!" A blush on his cheeks grew, showing Asuka she had just scored a direct hit.  
"哦，闭嘴！" 明日香回敬道，终于能够关上箱子的锁扣。"我得带些纪念品，你知道的！我可没听到你抱怨我前几天买的那件小衣服！" 他脸颊上的红晕加深，显示出明日香刚刚直接命中了他的要害。

"Uh, well," he stammered as he began to check all the drawers and closets, making sure nothing was left behind.  
"呃，这个，" 他结结巴巴地说着，开始检查所有的抽屉和衣柜，确保没有遗漏任何东西。

"I told you I got everything," Asuka huffed as she watched Shinji look behind the dressers and under the bed, "Don't you trust your own wife?"  
"我告诉过你我全拿齐了，" 明日香不悦地看着真嗣检查衣柜后面和床底下，"难道你不相信自己的妻子吗？

"It's not that, it's just…" Shinji glanced up and spotted something, before jumping on the bed and reaching up into the light fixture that hung over it. "Ah ha!"  
"不是那样的，只是……" 真嗣抬头瞥见什么，随即跳上床，伸手探入悬挂在床上的灯具中。"啊哈！"

"What?" Asuka wondered as her husband got off the bed and presented her with her favorite pair of panties, a lacey black thong that she knew drove Shinji wild. She blushed ten shades of red, remembering why that particular pair ended up in the light fixture.  
"什么？" 明日香疑惑地看着丈夫从床上下来，递给她最喜欢的那条内裤，一条黑色蕾丝丁字裤，她知道这能让真嗣为之疯狂。她脸红得像熟透的番茄，想起了那条内裤为何会出现在灯具里。

"Eep!" she squeaked as she snatched them from Shinji's hand and stuffed them in her purse. He really hoped that nobody at the airport wanted to search her purse before they got on the plane to head back to Tokyo-3. It would make for an interesting discussion. "Thanks, baby! Those are my favorite pair!"  
"哎呀！" 她尖叫一声，从真嗣手中夺过内裤，迅速塞进手提包里。他真心希望在前往第三新东京市的飞机上，机场没有人想检查她的手提包。那将会是一场有趣的讨论。"谢谢，宝贝！这是我最喜欢的一对！"

"No problem, hon," he replied as he took her in his arms and lightly kissed her before pulling back to look into her eyes. "They're mine, too!," Shinji wiggled his eyebrows. Both teens giggled as they turned to look out the balcony door for the last time.  
"没问题，亲爱的，" 他边说边将她拥入怀中，轻轻吻了她一下，然后退后一步，凝视着她的眼睛。"它们也是我的！" 真嗣挑了挑眉毛。两个少年都咯咯笑着，转身最后一次望向阳台门外。

"I'm going to miss this place," Asuka said as she melted back into Shinji's arms.  
"我会想念这个地方的，" 明日香说着，又融入了真嗣的怀抱。

"Me too," he replied as he held her close, " but it'll be good to get back home, back into our own bed."  
"我也是，" 他回答道，紧紧拥抱着她，"但回到家里，回到我们自己的床上，也会很好。"

"And see our family, too. I miss Misato, Rei, and Heidi," Asuka added. She and Shinji turned as a knock on the door announced the arrival of the bellhop to pick up their luggage. After several minutes, they were left alone in the room where they first consummated their love. Kissing each other once more, the two pilots took each other's hand and walked out the door, heading back to their new life in Tokyo-3.  
“也看看我们的家人。我想念美里、丽和海蒂。”明日香补充道。她和真嗣转身望向门口，敲门声预示着行李员来取行李了。几分钟后，他们独自留在那个初次共度爱夜的房间。再次亲吻彼此，两位驾驶员牵起对方的手，走出房门，踏上返回第三新东京市新生活的旅程。

End of Part Eight.  
第八部分 完

_**A/N**: First off, I'd like to apologize to all my fans for taking so long to get this chapter written and posted. Unfortunately, real life has a hell of a way to really screw up personal schedules. I wanted to write this chapter months ago, but it was just so damn hard for some reason. It may be because it's the first part of the next major part of the story, I don't know. I was only able to put in about half of what I really wanted to in this chapter. The rest will be add to the next chapters.  
作者注：首先，我要向所有粉丝道歉，这么久才完成并发布这一章。不幸的是，现实生活总有办法严重打乱个人计划。我本想几个月前就写完这一章，但不知为何就是异常艰难。或许是因为这是故事下一个重要部分的开始，我也不确定。这一章我只完成了原本设想的一半内容。其余部分将添加到后续章节中。_

_I worked on some of my other fics first to get back into the swing of things, but it's hard to shake off depression. A lot of things happened in my personal life that really kicked me in the nads, the worst of which was the medical problems of my oldest son, then the medical problems I seemed to have developed lately ( Kidney stones really SUCK!). So, I beg you forgiveness and pray for your indulgences as I present the next part of 'Father'. I hope I haven't disappointed! Lord Talon.  
我先着手处理了其他几篇作品，试图找回状态，但摆脱抑郁并不容易。我的个人生活中发生了许多事，让我备受打击，其中最严重的是我长子的健康问题，紧接着我自己似乎也出现了一些健康问题（肾结石真的很糟糕！）。因此，我恳请你们的谅解，并祈求你们的宽容，在此奉上《父亲》的下一章。希望我没有让你们失望！塔尔恩领主。_

### Comment
[xwcezq](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/14594987/xwcezq): No mention of who the biological father is and complete OOC Shinji in just a moment's notice was a complete turnoff. It's not bad per se, the writing is good and all considering the premise...  
没有提到生父是谁，而且突然间完全不像真希，这完全让人失望。它本身并不糟糕，考虑到前提条件，写作还不错...  
It's just that *considering* a 14 year old girl to get drunk at a party and 'r*ped' as the BASIS and ***1st chapter*** of your story; and that too by some unknown dude irrelevant to the story makes me NOT WANT TO READ IT AT ALL!  
只是，*考虑到*一个 14 岁的女孩在派对上喝醉酒并作为你故事的**第一章**被某个与故事无关的陌生人'强奸'，这让我完全不想读！  
  
If anyone is reading this, please tell me if the fic mentions who the biological father is in the later chapters? If not, then I guess I'm not reading this any further...  
如果有人在看这个，请告诉我这篇小说在后面的章节中是否提到了生物父亲是谁？如果没有，那我想我不会继续阅读了...

[Hoodiebud](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/13403003/Hoodiebud) :Holy shit, and all THAT was just CHAPTER ONE?!  
我靠，这还只是第一章？  
  
This is the best thing I've ever laid my eyes upon! Daaaammn! I was expecting it to be much darker (DISCLAIMER: In general. The whole uhhh, r*** thing is still dark as hell, and the whole "Asuka being bullied mood swings etc." situation broke my heart.)  
这是我见过的最棒的东西！太棒了我本来以为会更黑暗（声明：总体而言。旭日被欺负的情绪波动等 "情况让我心碎）。  
  
This Shinji blew me out of the water. Well, the entire first chapter blew me out of the water. My favorite side of Shinji is the "father" side that is rarely seen in fanfiction. The only other fanfictions with that side of him is AFTER IMPACT and The Second Try, and I adore and love both of those.  
这个信治让我大开眼界。整个第一章都让我大开眼界。我最喜欢真嗣 "父亲 "的一面，这在同人小说中很少见。在其他同人小说中，只有《AFTER IMPACT》和《The Second Try》有他这一面，而我非常喜欢这两部作品。  
  
I don't care if it's waaayy OOC, it just makes it better, not worse!  
我不在乎它是否太 OOC，这只会让它变得更好，而不是更糟！  
  
Also the foot massage part reminds of a moment in The Second Try where the lines from Asuka makes you believe they're... screwing around but then reveals Shinji is just really good at massaging. Here it's even better as the "build-up" is a little longer and the "punchline" better.  
另外，脚底按摩的部分让人想起了《第二次尝试》中的一个片段，明日香的台词让人以为他们在......鬼混，但后来发现真嗣真的很擅长按摩。这里的效果更好，因为 "铺垫 "更长，"点睛之笔 "更好。  
  
Everytime I find a critique that is constructive or not nitpicking, I quickly shrug it off, telling myself it just makes the chapter even better.  
每当我发现有建设性或不吹毛求疵的批评意见时，我都会迅速甩掉它，告诉自己它只会让这一章更加精彩。  
  
... Wow. Holy shit. Didn't know it was even possible to be a worse father than Gendo. I knew Asuka's father was... atrocious, but, you made me LIKE Gendo! This story is one hell of a ride, jeez. I would've loved if Shinji just stood there coldly and put lead between Erik's and "Mrs. Soryu's" eyes.  
...哇我的妈呀没想到还有比剑道更糟糕的父亲我知道明日香的父亲......很残暴，但是，你让我喜欢上了玄道！这个故事太刺激了，天啊我真希望真嗣只是冷冷地站在那里，把铅块放在艾瑞克和 "佐良夫人 "的眼睛中间。  
  
What's worse? A father who gladly manipulates and uses the people around him, including his own family, or a father who drove his former wife into commiting suicide, fooling around with Kyoko's doctor WHILE ASUKA, A 4 YEAR OLD IS HEARING, happily left Asuka, only to return years later to shoot her fiancée, hurt and damage his own daughter both physically and verbally, and then when "Mrs. Soryu" gets shoot and gets strangled himself, still doesn't give up but gets his ass beaten in the most "don't talk to me or my son, EVER AGAIN" moment by GENDO HIMSELF.  
哪个更糟糕？是一个乐于操纵和利用身边的人，包括自己家人的父亲，还是一个逼迫前妻自杀，在 4 岁的旭子听力受损时与京子的医生鬼混，高高兴兴地离开旭子，多年后又回来枪杀她的未婚妻，从身体和言语上伤害和损害自己女儿的父亲？当 "Soryu 夫人 "被枪杀，自己也被勒死时，他仍然没有放弃，而是被 GENDO 亲手打了一顿，这是最 "不要再跟我和我儿子说话 "的时刻。  
  
Oh, and worst of all, he committed the worst, most unholy sin that will send him to the 9th circle of hell:  
哦，最糟糕的是，他犯下了最严重、最邪恶的罪行，这将把他打入第九层地狱：  
  
TAX FRAUD.  税务欺诈。  
  
I'm proud of Gendo, being the (next) worst father and best father at the same time, even if he's still planning his own Third Impact. Then I remembered that SEELE's chairmen got shot by my man Kaji and realized "Oh no... Gendo is REALLY powerful now. He basically killed the king and queen and got all the pawns on his side in chess."  
我为玄道感到骄傲，他既是（下一个）最糟糕的父亲，同时又是最好的父亲，尽管他还在计划自己的 "第三次冲击"。然后我想起 SEELE 的主席被我的手下卡基射杀了，我意识到 "哦不......"。玄度现在真的很强大。"他杀了国王和王后" "让所有的棋子都站在了他这一边"  
  
I wonder what the next chapters will be like. Don't know if you can top the fight between the Soryus and the dysfunctional family.  
不知道接下来的章节会怎样。不知道你能否超越索里厄斯和不正常家庭之间的斗争。

[brainchow](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/11364834/brainchow) : A decent WAFF, but a bit too OOC. Shinji and Rei being siblings is also good, and the writing is decent, but I wish Asuka and Shinji’s dynamic wasn’t as different from the original series. Seeing a manly shinji and a domesticated Asuka is very weird, and not always in a good way.  
一部不错的 WAFF，但有点太 OOC 了。慎二和玲成为兄妹也不错，写得也很好，但我希望明日香和慎二的动态不要与原作系列有太大的差异。看到一个有男子气概的慎二和一个被驯化的明日香是非常奇怪的，而且并不总是好的方面。  
P.S. Asuka’s dad is American, and would go by Langley unless he took his wife’s name.  
附注：明日香的父亲是美国人，如果不随妻姓，他就会叫兰利。

**Soren**: This fanfiction is defective to change without any explanation or reason Asuka and Shinji temperament, both having a much stronger relationship. To believe both like each other but shinji of anguish and Asuka's pride prevent that approach, even if they suffer from it.  
这本同人小说是有缺陷的改变没有任何解释或理由明日香和信治的气质，都有一个更强大的关系。要相信两人都喜欢对方，但信治的痛苦和明日香的自尊心阻止了这种做法，即使他们深受其害。  
I could have written a slower history and more develop their character instead of the shinji readily have her request to marry. The best way to evolve their character is through failure and its falls. Shinji and Asuka placing falling several times and learning from the pain of his frustration to grow and become better people.  
我本可以写一段缓慢的历史，更多地发展他们的性格，而不是让信治轻易地提出结婚的要求。发展他们性格的最好方法就是通过失败和跌倒。真嗣和明日香曾多次跌倒，并从挫折的痛苦中学习成长，成为更好的人。  
The Asuka could have been involved with some guy she apparently thinks better than shinji and its level for the time to end up pregnant be abandoned, Asuka realize that she can not do it alone, she depends on others, it is isolated not wanting anyone else, but only get pain of loneliness. The point would be that it realizing that nothing can do it alone and needs of others, you will see that only shinji cared about her.  
明日香可能已经参与了一些人，她显然认为比慎二和其水平的时候，最终怀孕被遗弃，明日香意识到，她不能独自做到这一点，她依赖于他人，它是孤立的不希望任何人，但只得到孤独的痛苦。关键在于，明日香意识到自己一个人什么都做不了，需要别人的帮助，你会发现只有信治关心她。  
The shinji could have evolved in the direction that feels despised and resented it. Resolve grow as a person, never to be neglected. Resolve then change your life for the better. He gets involved with another girl and realizes that it is not happy and misses Asuka.  
真嗣可能会朝着被鄙视和怨恨的方向发展。决心成长为一个人，永远不被忽视。下定决心，改变自己的生活。他与另一个女孩交往，并意识到这并不快乐，他想念明日香。  
Best way to develop the plot would be through the obstacles that would allow the actors to rethink their lives and review your mistakes.  
发展情节的最佳方式是通过障碍，让演员们重新思考自己的生活，检讨自己的错误。
