有时我真的很讨厌同人小说格式化的方式。好了，就够了。

**Right so, I know that pretty much all of you were disappointed with the ending of Spawn of Adam, and I don't really blame you. It does heavily suck, but as I said, I had been planning that ending almost right from the get go, and was very pleased to see that it ended as such.  
是的，我知道你们几乎所有人都对《亚当的诞生》的结局感到失望，我真的不怪你们。它确实很糟糕，但正如我所说，我几乎从一开始就计划好了这个结局，并且很高兴看到它以这样的方式结束。**

**Two of Us is a direct sequel to Spawn of Adam, with an After Impact scenario involved. There will be a very interesting plot later down the road, as everybody awakens from Instrumentality, but before that to happen, Shinji and Asuka must grow to love each other again.  
《我们俩》是《亚当的重生》的直接续集，涉及一个撞击后的场景。稍后会有一个非常有趣的情节，因为每个人都从工具性中醒来，但在此之前，真嗣和明日香必须再次相爱。**

**For those of you that have waited for this, I thank you for your patience.  
对于那些等待这一切的人，我感谢你们的耐心等待。**
