I Don't Own Evangelion...though owning Evangelion 3.0 when it comes out would be pretty awesome!  
我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》……不过能拥有《福音战士新剧场版：Q》的话，那真是太棒了！

**Sometimes I really hate the way fanfiction formats stuff. Okay, enough with that.  
有时候我真的讨厌同人文的格式要求。好了，不多说了。

**Right so, I know that pretty much all of you were disappointed with the ending of Spawn of Adam, and I don't really blame you. It does heavily suck, but as I said, I had been planning that ending almost right from the get go, and was very pleased to see that it ended as such.  
那么，我知道你们大多数人对于《亚当之子》的结局感到失望，我并不真的怪你们。确实挺糟糕的，但正如我所说，我从一开始就几乎计划好了这个结局，看到它如此结束，我感到非常满意。**

**Two of Us is a direct sequel to Spawn of Adam, with an After Impact scenario involved. There will be a very interesting plot later down the road, as everybody awakens from Instrumentality, but before that to happen, Shinji and Asuka must grow to love each other again.  
《我们俩》是《亚当之子》的直接续集，涉及一个后冲击情景。随着每个人从工具化中醒来，后续将会有一个非常有趣的情节，但在那之前，真嗣和明日香必须再次相爱。**

**For those of you that have waited for this, I thank you for your patience.  
对于那些一直等待的朋友们，我感谢你们的耐心。**

Third Impact had been avoided, for better or for worse. The world had been saved, and everything was set as it should be. But was that really true? For two people, that may not necessarily be true.  
第三次冲击被避免了，无论结果是好是坏。世界得救了，一切回归正轨。但这真的就是真相吗？对两个人来说，这未必是事实。

Shinji and Asuka had connected with each other, they had loved each other, they had fought for each other, and then at the end of it all, they had lost each other. Had everything been futile then? Had every moment they had ever spent with each other been for naught? Maybe this was true, but the body remembered.  
真嗣和明日香曾彼此相连，他们相爱，为对方而战，最终却失去了彼此。那么，这一切都是徒劳的吗？他们共度的每一刻都毫无意义吗？或许确实如此，但身体却记得。

Love is a strange thing, and love can vary from person to person. The love of a husband and wife; the love of a father and mother; the love of a boyfriend and girlfriend. Love can vary depending on the individuals definition of what "love" is. Love is more an emotion, more like a feeling you have when you are around somebody, something which can't be replicated no matter how many times you attempt to recreate it.  
爱是一种奇妙的东西，因人而异。夫妻之爱；父母之爱；男女朋友之爱。爱的定义因人而异。爱更多是一种情感，一种当你在别人身边时的感觉，无论尝试多少次都无法复制。

So then what hope did Shinji and Asuka ever have to love each other again? Maybe it was simply the fact that they were drawn to each other, that such an outcome was always unthinkable. But that love had to be rekindled, reborn to what it once was.  
那么，真嗣和明日香还有什么希望再次相爱呢？也许仅仅是因为他们被彼此吸引，这样的结果总是难以想象。但那份爱必须重新点燃，重生为曾经的模样。

Love is an abstract thing, similar to that of AT-fields and memories. It can't be seen, except in the vision of the person who is seeing it. Some describe it as red, while others simply describe it as a warm feeling in the heart. People try to explain what they feel, but are unable to. Why is that? Is it because they don't understand each other? That they don't understand what love is?"  
爱是一种抽象的东西，类似于 AT 力场和记忆。它看不见，除非在看到它的人的视野中。有人形容它是红色的，而其他人则简单地描述为心中的温暖感觉。人们试图解释他们的感受，但却无法做到。为什么呢？是因为他们彼此不理解吗？还是因为他们不明白什么是爱？

Then what about Shinji and Asuka? Neither of them understood what love was when they first met, having never experienced such a thing in either of there lives before meeting each other. So then, how was it that two fifteen year olds were able to understand the concept better then adults? Is it because they were younger, that they didn't understand things?  
那么，真嗣和明日香呢？他们初次相遇时都不明白什么是爱，因为在此之前他们都没有经历过这样的事情。那么，两个十五岁的孩子是如何比成年人更好地理解这个概念的呢？是因为他们年轻，所以不懂事吗？

Or was it because that they had first connected as human beings, before making that next giant leap?  
还是因为他们首先作为人类建立了联系，然后才迈出了那巨大的一步？

Whatever the reason was, Shinji and Asuka had once loved each other, that much was certain. But now, as the earth settled back into its normal rotation, and the Tree of Life began regrowing, they would have to make do with what was given to them. Third Impact was over with, and the Lilim would return one day and reside once again upon the earth. But until then, Shinji and Asuka were given time to grow whole once again.  
无论原因是什么，碇真嗣和明日香曾经相爱过，这一点是毋庸置疑的。但现在，随着地球恢复正常的自转，生命之树开始重新生长，他们只能接受所给予的一切。第三次冲击已经结束，人类将有一天会重返地球。但在那之前，真嗣和明日香被赋予了时间，让他们再次变得完整。

Shinji opened his eyes groggily; he had passed into a restless sleep, nothing of which he seemed to have recalled. He had dreamt something, but he didn't know what.  
真嗣昏昏沉沉地睁开眼睛；他陷入了一个不安的睡眠，似乎什么都没记住。他做了个梦，但不知道是什么。

He instead turned his gaze to the girl lying on the beach next to him. She was still motionless. Shinji had checked every hour or so, but she still continued breathing normally. Once or twice, he had almost nudged her gently, but stopped himself at the last minute. Part of him wanted to continue watching her sleep, but the other part of him wanted to talk to her, to get to know her, to understand who she was.  
他转而将目光投向躺在沙滩上的女孩。她依然一动不动。真嗣每隔一小时左右就会检查一次，但她仍然正常呼吸。有一两次，他几乎轻轻地碰了她一下，但最后一刻停住了。一部分他想继续看着她睡觉，但另一部分他想和她说话，了解她，理解她是谁。

Shinji was admittedly lonely, and he was rather surprised at that. He had never cared much about people before, but this girl who he had never once seen in his life...  
真嗣确实感到孤独，对此他颇为惊讶。他以前从未真正在意过别人，但这个女孩，他一生中从未见过一面...

'What is wrong with me?' thought Shinji.  
'我这是怎么了？' 真嗣心想。

Looking once more at her pale skin and her sleeping face, Shinji turned away from her, and passed into another fitful sleep, in which his thoughts were filled with that girls face.  
再次看向她苍白的皮肤和沉睡的面容，真嗣转过身去，陷入了另一场不安的睡眠，梦中满是那个女孩的面容。
