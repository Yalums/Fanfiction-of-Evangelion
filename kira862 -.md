Third Impact had been avoided, for better or for worse. The world had been saved, and everything was set as it should be. But was that really true? For two people, that may not necessarily be true.  
第三次冲击被避免了，无论结果是好是坏。世界得救了，一切回归正轨。但这真的就是真相吗？对两个人来说，这未必是事实。

Shinji and Asuka had connected with each other, they had loved each other, they had fought for each other, and then at the end of it all, they had lost each other. Had everything been futile then? Had every moment they had ever spent with each other been for naught? Maybe this was true, but the body remembered.  
真嗣和明日香曾彼此相连，他们相爱，为对方而战，最终却失去了彼此。那么，这一切都是徒劳的吗？他们共度的每一刻都毫无意义吗？或许确实如此，但身体却记得。

Love is a strange thing, and love can vary from person to person. The love of a husband and wife; the love of a father and mother; the love of a boyfriend and girlfriend. Love can vary depending on the individuals definition of what "love" is. Love is more an emotion, more like a feeling you have when you are around somebody, something which can't be replicated no matter how many times you attempt to recreate it.  
爱是一种奇妙的东西，因人而异。夫妻之爱；父母之爱；男女朋友之爱。爱的定义因人而异。爱更多是一种情感，一种当你在别人身边时的感觉，无论尝试多少次都无法复制。

So then what hope did Shinji and Asuka ever have to love each other again? Maybe it was simply the fact that they were drawn to each other, that such an outcome was always unthinkable. But that love had to be rekindled, reborn to what it once was.  
那么，真嗣和明日香还有什么希望再次相爱呢？也许仅仅是因为他们被彼此吸引，这样的结果总是难以想象。但那份爱必须重新点燃，重生为曾经的模样。

Love is an abstract thing, similar to that of AT-fields and memories. It can't be seen, except in the vision of the person who is seeing it. Some describe it as red, while others simply describe it as a warm feeling in the heart. People try to explain what they feel, but are unable to. Why is that? Is it because they don't understand each other? That they don't understand what love is?"  
爱是一种抽象的东西，类似于 AT 力场和记忆。它看不见，除非在看到它的人的视野中。有人形容它是红色的，而其他人则简单地描述为心中的温暖感觉。人们试图解释他们的感受，但却无法做到。为什么呢？是因为他们彼此不理解吗？还是因为他们不明白什么是爱？

Then what about Shinji and Asuka? Neither of them understood what love was when they first met, having never experienced such a thing in either of there lives before meeting each other. So then, how was it that two fifteen year olds were able to understand the concept better then adults? Is it because they were younger, that they didn't understand things?  
那么，真嗣和明日香呢？他们初次相遇时都不明白什么是爱，因为在此之前他们都没有经历过这样的事情。那么，两个十五岁的孩子是如何比成年人更好地理解这个概念的呢？是因为他们年轻，所以不懂事吗？

Or was it because that they had first connected as human beings, before making that next giant leap?  
还是因为他们首先作为人类建立了联系，然后才迈出了那巨大的一步？

Whatever the reason was, Shinji and Asuka had once loved each other, that much was certain. But now, as the earth settled back into its normal rotation, and the Tree of Life began regrowing, they would have to make do with what was given to them. Third Impact was over with, and the Lilim would return one day and reside once again upon the earth. But until then, Shinji and Asuka were given time to grow whole once again.  
无论原因是什么，碇真嗣和明日香曾经相爱过，这一点是毋庸置疑的。但现在，随着地球恢复正常的自转，生命之树开始重新生长，他们只能接受所给予的一切。第三次冲击已经结束，人类将有一天会重返地球。但在那之前，真嗣和明日香被赋予了时间，让他们再次变得完整。

Shinji opened his eyes groggily; he had passed into a restless sleep, nothing of which he seemed to have recalled. He had dreamt something, but he didn't know what.  
真嗣昏昏沉沉地睁开眼睛；他陷入了一个不安的睡眠，似乎什么都没记住。他做了个梦，但不知道是什么。

He instead turned his gaze to the girl lying on the beach next to him. She was still motionless. Shinji had checked every hour or so, but she still continued breathing normally. Once or twice, he had almost nudged her gently, but stopped himself at the last minute. Part of him wanted to continue watching her sleep, but the other part of him wanted to talk to her, to get to know her, to understand who she was.  
他转而将目光投向躺在沙滩上的女孩。她依然一动不动。真嗣每隔一小时左右就会检查一次，但她仍然正常呼吸。有一两次，他几乎轻轻地碰了她一下，但最后一刻停住了。一部分他想继续看着她睡觉，但另一部分他想和她说话，了解她，理解她是谁。

Shinji was admittedly lonely, and he was rather surprised at that. He had never cared much about people before, but this girl who he had never once seen in his life...  
真嗣确实感到孤独，对此他颇为惊讶。他以前从未真正在意过别人，但这个女孩，他一生中从未见过一面...

'What is wrong with me?' thought Shinji.  
'我这是怎么了？' 真嗣心想。

Looking once more at her pale skin and her sleeping face, Shinji turned away from her, and passed into another fitful sleep, in which his thoughts were filled with that girls face.  
再次看向她苍白的皮肤和沉睡的面容，真嗣转过身去，陷入了另一场不安的睡眠，梦中满是那个女孩的面容。

### Chapter 2: New Beginnings  
第二章：新的开始  

**ANNNNNNNND I'M BACK. Wow Jesus how long has it been...four months I think? Anyway yeah sorry guys about that long bout of nothing. I just had so much stuff going on during that last term of school that this was put on the back burner for a long time. But I'm back to updating this (for a while at least, things might get slow again in September). So again, thanks to everybody that waited patiently for this and I apologize for the wait.  
我回来了。哇，天哪，这都过去多久了……四个月吧？总之，很抱歉让大家等了这么久。上个学期我实在太忙了，以至于这件事一直被搁置。但现在我又回来更新了（至少暂时是这样，九月可能又会慢下来）。再次感谢所有耐心等待的朋友，对于等待我深表歉意。**

---

Shinji opened his eyes slowly.  
真嗣缓缓睁开了眼睛。

For several seconds, as he looked around, he didn't know where he was.  
有几秒钟，他环顾四周，不知道自己在哪里。

Then he looked down at the girl next to him with strawberry colored hair and he remembered. Or at least, he remembered some things...  
然后他低头看着身边那个草莓色头发的女孩，他想起来了。或者说，至少他想起了一些事情……

The sun was setting over on the horizon, turning the blood colored water a sickly red hue. The capsized battleships floating meaninglessly out in the Bay of Tokyo-3, their purposes long served. Above the beaches where Shinji sat on, the city of Tokyo-3 lay quietly, almost as though it was sleeping peacefully. Such a calm sound had not been heard in this part of the world for a long forgotten time.  
太阳正缓缓沉入地平线，将血色的水面染成病态的红色。倾覆的战舰无意义地漂浮在东京-3 湾，它们早已完成了使命。在真嗣坐着的沙滩上方，东京-3 市静静地躺着，仿佛在安详地沉睡。这片世界的一隅，已经很久没有听到过如此平静的声音了。

Amidst all of this, Shinji and the girl next to him where the only two people that stood out among the destruction of Tokyo-3 and the world.  
在这片混乱之中，唯有真嗣和他身旁的女孩在东京-3 及世界的废墟中显得格外突出。

Shinji continued gazing at the sun, watching it slowly continue setting, seemingly sinking into the ocean. Now that he was awake, he had to admit that he was a little afraid.  
真嗣继续凝视着太阳，看着它缓缓西沉，仿佛沉入了大海。醒来后，他不得不承认自己有些害怕。

During his brief nap, he had hoped that more humans would show up, someone that could help him, or even explain what had happened to everything. But now, with night starting, he was having to face reality that he may be the only person in the city.  
在短暂的打盹期间，他曾希望会有更多的人出现，能有人帮助他，或是解释这一切是如何发生的。但如今夜幕降临，他不得不面对现实，自己可能是这座城市里唯一的幸存者。

'Or at least one of the only people,' he thought as he eyes trailed down towards the girl next to him. Her chest was still slowly moving up and down, indicating that she was breathing, but Shinji had hoped that she would have woken up while he had been asleep. He would at least have someone to talk to and maybe she even knew what had happened. Her attire would certainly suggest that she wasn't a normal fifteen year old girl.  
“或者说至少是其中之一，”他心想，目光顺着身旁女孩的方向滑落。她的胸膛仍在缓缓起伏，表明她还活着，但真嗣本希望她能在他熟睡时醒来。那样至少有人可以交谈，或许她甚至知道发生了什么。她的装束无疑表明她不是普通的十五岁少女。

Shinji looked at her for a few seconds longer, letting his eyes travel over her face before he shook his head and stood up. He didn't know what he was gonna do, but simply sitting wasn't helping. He needed to think.  
真嗣又多看了她几秒钟，目光在她脸上游移，随后摇了摇头站起身来。他不知道自己该做什么，但只是坐着无济于事。他需要思考。

Standing up he directed his gaze farther down the beach and then up the sandy slope behind him to the wreckage that was Tokyo-3. He supposed that he would have to go into the city eventually, but he didn't feel like he was ready for that. Things still hadn't...quite sunk in yet.  
站起身来，他将视线投向更远的沙滩，然后转向身后沙坡上的废墟——东京-3。他想自己迟早得进城，但感觉还没准备好面对这一切。事情仍未完全……沉入心底。

Digging his hands into his pockets, he started walking along the beach, just as the sun disappeared across the water.  
他将双手插进口袋，沿着海滩开始漫步，就在太阳消失在水面之际。

'Okay...what had happened?' was Shinji's first thought.  
'好吧……发生了什么？'这是真嗣的第一个念头。

The end of the world was the most apparent answer, but Shinji couldn't just take that laying down.  
世界末日是最显而易见的答案，但真嗣不能就这样躺平接受。

He been living in Tokyo-3 for what...half a year or so? His father had sent him here at the beginning of the year and made him live at an apartment with some guy. His father had brought him here for an unknown reason, but Shinji had wondered if it hadn't had something to do with Nerv. He could remember waking up this morning and going to class and everything as if it was a normal day...and then nothing. Several hours seemed to have just been taken out of his memory it seemed like. He was supposed to be living with a new roommate tomorrow also, but that didn't seem like it would be happening anytime soon.  
他在第三新东京市住了多久来着...大概半年左右吧？年初时，他的父亲把他送到这里，让他和一个家伙住在公寓里。父亲带他来这里的原因不明，但真嗣怀疑这与 NERV 有关。他记得今早醒来去上课，一切都像平常一样...然后就什么都没有了。几个小时似乎从他的记忆中消失了。他原本明天要和一个新室友一起住，但那似乎不会很快发生。

Kicking his feet as he walked along the sand, he looked towards a large building that seemed to have been a hotel of some sorts. It looked like the building had been in disrepair for several years. Was it somehow possible that Shinji had been sent into the future somehow?  
他一边沿着沙滩走，一边踢着脚下的沙子，目光投向一座看似曾是酒店的大型建筑。那栋楼看起来已经破败多年。难道真嗣不知怎么地被送到了未来？

'Thats fucking stupid,' thought Shinji. 'No...something more plausible than that.'  
'这他妈的太蠢了，'真嗣心想。'不...比那更合理的事情。'

Though he honestly couldn't think of anything.  
虽然他真的想不出任何事情。

Stopping suddenly he looked up towards the sky and was surprised that he could see the stars. He couldn't remember ever seeing the stars his entire time living in Tokyo-3.  
他突然停下脚步，抬头望向天空，惊讶地发现自己能看到星星。他不记得自己在东京-3 生活的整个时间里曾见过星星。

"Are there really no other humans?" mumbled Shinji.  
“真的没有其他人类了吗？”真嗣喃喃自语。

He had never really enjoyed associating with people, but to just have everyone disappear all at once was just too strange.  
他从未真正喜欢与人交往，但所有人突然间全部消失，这未免太过诡异。

"It doesn't make any sense," sighed Shinji.  
“这毫无道理，”真嗣叹息道。

Running a hand through his hair he looked back towards the way he had come. He could still see the body of the girl in the distance, and was glad that he could still see her. Though the darkness was certainly starting to get heavier, and without the light from Tokyo-3-  
他用手梳理着头发，回头望向他来时的路。他仍能看到远处那女孩的遗体，庆幸自己还能看见她。尽管黑暗确实开始变得浓重，若没有第三新东京市的光亮——

'This might be a problem,' thought Shinji.  
“这可能是个问题，”真嗣心想。

He didn't know what had happened, or why it seemed only himself and the strange girl were alive in the city, but right now he had to focus on other things.  
他不知道发生了什么，或者为什么这座城市里似乎只有他和那个陌生女孩还活着，但此刻他必须专注于其他事情。

Walking to the edge of the water, he ran his hand in it, but only felt the odd substance of the fluid, almost like sand. It was like he was on a different world, a separate earth. Nothing made sense.  
走到水边，他伸手进去，却只感觉到那种奇怪的液体，几乎像沙子一样。这感觉就像他身处另一个世界，一个截然不同的地球。一切都说不通。

'I'm alive though, so I suppose I should be thankful for that.'  
'我还活着，所以我想我应该为此感到庆幸。'

Though was he really being honest? With the world as it was, living would be-  
尽管他真的诚实吗？在这个世界上，活着会是——

Shinji stopped himself here; it was pointless to think about anything other than the next hour of his life.  
真嗣在这里打断了自己的思绪；除了接下来的一个小时，思考其他任何事情都是没有意义的。

Turning towards the ruins of Tokyo-3, a frown passed over his face. He knew that he would have to explore them tonight, even if he didn't really want to. And though he didn't want to admit it, the fact that the girl hadn't woken up yet was starting to trouble him.  
转身望向东京-3 的废墟，他眉头紧锁。他知道今晚必须去探查一番，尽管内心并不情愿。而且，尽管他不愿承认，女孩至今未醒的事实开始让他感到困扰。

Moving away from the water, he decided on his course, though whether it was the correct or wrong decision, he didn't know.  
离开水边，他决定了自己的路线，尽管这决定是对是错，他无从知晓。

Walking back to where the girl lay didn't take long and he was soon caught in a problem; he didn't want to let her out of his sight. It was worry more than anything. He didn't want to run the risk of him not being there when she woke up, or if something more serious happened-  
走回女孩躺着的地方并不需要太久，很快他就遇到了一个问题；他不想让她离开自己的视线。更多的是出于担忧。他不想冒着她醒来时或发生更严重情况时自己不在的风险——

Shinji shook his head. 真嗣摇了摇头。

'Best not to think about that,' he thought.  
'最好别去想那件事，'他心想。

On the other hand though, he couldn't very well carry her. It would have been...awkward.  
不过另一方面，他也不太可能把她抱起来。那样会显得...很尴尬。

'What to do,' thought Shinji. 'I don't want to leave her, but at the same time I don't have much of a choice.'  
“该怎么办呢，”真嗣心想，“我不想离开她，但同时我也没有太多选择。”

Shinji then noticed a piece of driftwood not too far off in the distance. Looking around him, he noticed that there was a strange amount of wood laying around the beach, most of which seemed to have been splintered off from buildings.  
随后，真嗣注意到不远处有一块浮木。环顾四周，他发现海滩上散落着大量木头，其中大部分似乎是从建筑物上碎裂下来的。

"Right...a fire would work," mumbled Shinji as he started counting the pieces of wood. The fire would help not only to relieve his worries of the girl, but also if there were any more survivors, they may see the flames and be drawn to it.  
"“对……生火应该有用，”真嗣喃喃自语，开始数起木柴的数量。火不仅能缓解他对女孩的担忧，如果有其他幸存者，他们也可能看到火光而被吸引过来。”

'But making it is another problem,' frowned Shinji. He had never tried lighting a flame without anything other than a match.  
"“但生火又是另一个问题，”真嗣皱眉道。他从未尝试过不用火柴以外的任何东西点燃火焰。”

'One step at a time,' he told himself as he stood up. He was rather glad to be moving and having a set goal to work towards. It certainly kept his mind off of other things.  
“一步一个脚印，”他自言自语道，站起身来。能够行动并有一个明确的目标去努力，他感到相当欣慰。这无疑让他的思绪从其他事情上转移开来。

Gathering up as much dry wood as he could, he then scaled the sandy slope behind him to the top where there was some dry brush and picked several handfuls and brought it back down to the beach. He didn't have any sort of way to chop the wood so he dug a hole in the sand using one of the pieces of wood and dug himself a sand pit. Placing the larger pieces of wood at the bottom, he stacked it higher with the smaller pieces, hoping that it would burn longer like this. He kept a pile of wood next to this pit as extra kindling incase the flames started to die down.  
他尽可能多地收集干木柴，然后爬上身后沙质的斜坡，到达顶部有一些干枯灌木的地方，抓了几大把带回海滩。他没有工具来劈开木头，于是用一根木头在沙地上挖了一个洞，为自己挖了一个沙坑。他将较大的木块放在底部，用较小的木块堆叠得更高，希望这样能让火燃烧得更久。他在沙坑旁留了一堆木柴作为额外的引火物，以防火焰开始减弱。

Now though, the problem was exactly how he was going to make those flames.  
不过现在，问题在于他究竟要如何制造出那些火焰。

Climbing back up the slope he stood up at the top and looked towards the destruction of Tokyo-3. Everything was much more apparent up here.  
他爬回坡顶，站起身来，望向被摧毁的第三新东京市。站在这里，一切景象都更加清晰可见。

The shops and stores that littered the edge of the beach looked as though they had been bombed from the inside. Empty holes filled the window frames and twisting pieces of metal lined the sides of them, indicating that they were once chairs and tables. Most likely a coffee shop of some kind. Thankfully though, a road also ran along this stretch of the beach and Shinji didn't think he would have to search far before he found a lighter.  
散布在海滩边缘的商店和店铺看起来就像是从内部被轰炸过一样。窗框里填满了空洞，扭曲的金属片沿着两侧排列，表明它们曾经是椅子和桌子。很可能是某种咖啡店。不过幸运的是，海滩这一段也有一条路，真嗣认为他不用费多大力气就能找到一个打火机。

Any thought that what he was doing was wrong must have been long since abandoned, because Shinji had no problems going through the cars, purses, glove compartments, and other peoples belongings as he searched for a lighter. Maybe it was because of his disassociation with people in general, or maybe he just buried that part of his mind which told him it was wrong. Certainly if there had been bodies in the cars like he had initially been worried about, or the peoples clothes he would have had second thoughts. But without any of this, he was able to pick through things without thinking about it.  
任何认为他所做的事情是错误的念头肯定早已被抛诸脑后，因为真嗣在寻找打火机时，毫不犹豫地翻遍了汽车、钱包、手套箱和其他人的物品。也许是因为他与人们普遍的疏离感，或者他只是埋葬了那部分告诉他这是错误的思想。当然，如果车里有像他最初担心的尸体，或者人们的衣物，他可能会有所犹豫。但没有这些，他就能毫不犹豫地翻找东西。

Finally after about the seventh car he had been through, he found a lighter on the ground of the drive side door. Flicking it on, a golden flame lit in front of him and seemed to wave back and forth at him. Flicking it off, Shinji leaned out of the car and stood up.  
终于，在检查了大约第七辆车后，他在驾驶座车门的地板上发现了一个打火机。轻轻一按，一簇金色的火焰在他面前燃起，似乎在向他摇摆。关掉打火机，真嗣探出车外，站了起来。

Sliding back down the slope to the beach below, he jogged to the fire pit and kneeled down next to it. Setting the brush on top of the wood, he placed the lighter in the brush and lit it. Grabbing some of the smaller logs, he placed them gently on top of the brush, letting the logs catch fire. Shifting the logs that were now lit around, he proceeded to gently stroke the fire, catching the sparks on the other pieces of wood. Tokyo-3's nights could be particularly brutal at times, and Shinji wanted not only himself, but the girl to be warm.  
他滑下斜坡回到海滩，小跑向篝火坑，跪在旁边。将树枝放在木头上，他把打火机放在树枝中点燃。抓起一些小木柴，轻轻放在树枝上，让木柴着火。移动已经点燃的木柴，他开始温柔地拨弄火焰，让火花点燃其他木块。第三新东京市的夜晚有时特别严酷，真嗣不仅希望自己，也希望那个女孩能感到温暖。

Glancing over at her, he saw that she was still sleeping...or unconscious. He wasn't really sure to be true. But she was still breathing, and that seemed to be okay.  
他瞥了她一眼，发现她还在睡...或者是不省人事。他不太确定真相如何。但她仍在呼吸，这似乎还算好。

With the fire roaring now and warmth starting to spread through his body, Shinji's mind went back to the darkness of Tokyo-3. He wasn't tired, and this surprised him since he had been up and down that slope now twice over, but he wasn't sure if he was ready to look for anything else in that darkness.  
随着火焰熊熊燃烧，温暖开始传遍全身，真嗣的思绪回到了东京-3 的黑暗中。他并不困倦，这让他感到惊讶，因为他已经在这斜坡上上下下了两次，但他不确定自己是否准备好在这黑暗中寻找其他东西。

He was hungry however, and this suddenly became apparent as he felt his stomach rumble.  
他饿了，这一点突然变得明显，因为他感到肚子咕噜作响。

Food was one thing, but water was entirely different. If he put it off till tomorrow, would he still be able to get it? He couldn't imagine these buildings being in the best condition and hadn't really thought until now about the dangers of one of those falling down when he was near one, or worse, inside of one. But wandering around in the dark was a different situation all together.  
食物尚可应付，但水却是另一回事。如果他拖延到明天，还能否得到水呢？他无法想象这些建筑能保持最佳状态，直到此刻才真正考虑到靠近或更糟地置身其中一座倒塌的危险。但在黑暗中徘徊则是完全不同的境况。

'And I'm still worried about her...' thought Shinji as his eyes went to the girl in the strange outfit. He had no idea what her situation was. Whether she was hungry, thirsty, or anything of the sorts, but if the fire did end up going out during the night, then the cold breeze of the ocean would be sure to freeze them quickly. Getting a cold was certainly the last thing he desired right now.  
'我还是担心她...' 新治的目光落在那位身着奇装异服的女孩身上。他完全不了解她的处境，不知道她是否饿了、渴了，或是其他什么情况。但如果夜里的篝火真的熄灭了，那么海风带来的寒意肯定会迅速将他们冻僵。感冒无疑是眼下他最不希望发生的事。

'Water and blankets then,' thought Shinji as he rested his chin in his hand as he looked into the torrent of flames dancing in front of him. As he looked towards the girl, he could see the shadow of the flames flickering off her face. Watching the flames dance across her face for a moment longer, he eventually placed his hands on his knees and pushed himself upwards. Pocketing the lighter which he had placed beside him, he proceeded to venture into the darkened city.  
“那就水和毯子吧。” 碇真嗣一边想着，一边用手托着下巴，凝视着眼前跳跃的火焰洪流。当他望向女孩时，能看到火焰的影子在她脸上闪烁。他又多看了一会儿火焰在她脸上舞动的景象，最终双手撑膝，站起身来。他将放在身旁的打火机揣进口袋，随后踏入了黑暗的城市之中。

Shinji didn't want to walk far; as long as he could see the light of the fire in the distance he wasn't as worried, but the state of the buildings were starting to worry him.  
真嗣并不想走得太远；只要他能看见远处火光的闪烁，他就不那么担心，但建筑物的状况开始让他感到忧虑。

It looked like nuclear fallout had occurred, and every building that he walked by looked as though it had been in a state of disrepair for several years. He did check in several vehicles as he made his way into the city, but didn't find anything he considered useful.  
看起来仿佛发生了核辐射泄漏，他经过的每一栋建筑都像是多年失修的样子。他在进城途中检查了几辆车，但没找到任何他认为有用的东西。

With the lighter in his hand, he passed many stores, most of which didn't seem to even have a scrap of paper left inside it. Whatever had occurred, seemed to have destroyed everything down to the smallest item.  
手中握着打火机，他走过许多店铺，大多数店内似乎连一片纸屑都不剩。无论发生了什么，似乎都将一切摧毁至最微小的物品。

There was one thing that surprised him as he walked around the outskirts of the city, and that seemed that animals were completely unaffected by whatever had happened. As he had passed a car at one point, he saw a dog grabbing something in its mouth, only realizing seconds later that it was a large piece of meat, like the leg of a butchered animal. The dog growled at him however, and Shinji didn't want to press his luck. He may have had the lighter, but he'd rather not get bitten by a wild dog.  
在他漫步于城市边缘时，有一件事让他颇为惊讶，那就是动物们似乎完全不受所发生之事的影响。当他经过一辆车时，看到一只狗正用嘴叼着什么东西，几秒钟后才意识到那是一大块肉，像是屠宰后的动物腿。然而，那狗对他低吼了一声，真嗣并不想冒险。他虽有打火机在手，但更不愿被野狗咬伤。

As the dim light of the fire started to get further and further away, Shinji was just feeling that he was wasting his efforts on something which may not even exist. As he walked past a small store though he turned his head, and paused as he looked into the store. Holding the lighter out in front of himself, he looked past the darkened windows to what was inside.  
随着火光的微弱光芒逐渐远去，真嗣开始觉得自己在为一个可能根本不存在的东西浪费努力。然而，当他走过一家小店时，他转过头，停下脚步向店内望去。他举起打火机照亮前方，透过昏暗的窗户窥视着里面的景象。

The store was better off than most of the others he had passed along the way, and looking at it, Shinji guessed that it had been a sporting goods store of some kind. Carefully walking in between the shattered glass panels of the window, he stepped through the empty window and looked around at the shop.  
这家店铺比他沿途经过的大多数都要好些，环顾四周，真嗣猜测这里曾经是一家体育用品店。他小心翼翼地穿过窗户上破碎的玻璃，跨过空荡荡的窗框，打量着店内。

Most of the shelves were still intact, though with a certain darkened color to the wood, suggesting that it had caught fire. Passing what looked like a twisted cash register, Shinji walked along the aisles peering through the darkness as he did. Twisted pieces of metal, melted rubber, and broken pieces of wood were only some of the things that he passed on his may towards the back of the store. He was hoping to find some sleeping bags, but even that didn't seem very promising.  
大部分货架依旧完好无损，只是木头呈现出一种暗沉的色泽，暗示着它们曾遭受过火灾。经过一个扭曲的收银机，真嗣沿着货架间的小道前行，一边走一边透过黑暗窥视。扭曲的金属片、融化的橡胶和破碎的木块，只是他在前往店铺后部途中所见的一部分景象。他希望能找到一些睡袋，但即便这一点也似乎希望渺茫。

He reached the back of the store, but was met only with a rack of blackened shoes, all too brittle to even pick up. Shaking his head in defeat, he was about to backtrack and head back to the beach when he spotted an employee only sign on a door to the far right of the back wall. He hesitated for a second, thinking things couldn't be much better there than out here but didn't see any reason why he shouldn't at least look. He walked towards to the door and pushed it inwards.  
他来到了商店的后部，却只看到一排烧焦的鞋子，全都脆得连拿起都困难。他无奈地摇了摇头，正准备折返回到海滩时，注意到后墙右侧有一扇门上挂着“员工专用”的牌子。他犹豫了一瞬，心想那里的情况未必比这里好，但又觉得至少应该看看。于是他走向那扇门，推了推。

Except it wouldn't budge.  
然而，门却纹丝不动。

Shinji pushed again, adding more pressure to the door, but even then it wouldn't move an inch. He even tried kicking it, but this was more in frustration than anything.  
真嗣再次用力推门，增加了压力，但门依旧纹丝不动。他甚至尝试踢门，但这更多的是出于沮丧而非实际效果。

With sweat finally starting to run down his cheek, he leaned up against the side of the door and cursed quietly. The roof must have caved in, but if something that could help him did exist back there, he wanted to do everything he could to get it.  
汗水终于开始顺着他的脸颊流下，他靠在门边，低声咒骂。屋顶肯定已经坍塌，但如果那里真的有什么能帮助他的东西，他希望能尽一切可能去获取。

Looking around for something to hit the door with, something perhaps more solid, he spotted a golf club, a driver that hadn't been turned into a chunk of metal. Grabbing it, he walked back over to the door and stood before it with the club held in his hands. Take a few steps back, he lunged forward and swung with all his might against the door. A golf club had certainly never been used like this before. The club made contact with the door and made a large dent in it with a loud hollow sound.  
环顾四周寻找可以用来砸门的硬物，他瞥见了一支高尔夫球杆，一支尚未被砸成金属块的球杆。他抓起球杆，走回门前，双手握住球杆站在那里。后退几步，他猛地向前冲去，用尽全力挥杆击打门板。高尔夫球杆从未被这样使用过。球杆击中门板，发出一声沉闷的巨响，并在上面留下了一个大凹痕。

Stepping back from the door, Shinji swung again, this time cracking the wood and on his third swing, he broke through the wood, creating a sizable hole that he could look through. Throwing the golf club to one side he looked through the hole while holding up the lighter next to him.  
从门前退开，真嗣再次挥杆，这次木门裂开了，第三次挥击时，他打破了木板，制造出一个足够大的洞，可以透过它窥视。他将高尔夫球杆扔到一旁，举起打火机靠近洞口，透过洞口向外张望。

The roof overhead had certainly caved in, and a bunch of the ceiling lay scattered across the room and directly in front of the the door lay several large pieces of wood. But Shinji saw hope in this. He had been afraid that the wood had been piled in front of the door, be he figured that if he swung a few more times at the door, he would be able to push his way through it. He did just that.  
头顶的屋顶确实已经坍塌，一部分天花板碎片散落在房间各处，而门前则横亘着几块大木板。但真嗣在这景象中看到了希望。他原本担心木板会被堆砌在门前，但他推测，只要再多挥几下，就能推开这些障碍。他便如此行动了。

It took ten minutes for him to accomplish this before his hands were blistered and red from clutching the club so tightly, but he finally made it through. Dropping the driver, he pushed his way through the door, wincing slightly as the splinters he had missed dug into his skin and pierced it, making him bleed slightly. He ignored this though, and didn't think anything of it.  
他花了十分钟才完成这一任务，双手因紧握球杆而起泡发红，但最终还是成功了。他丢下球杆，推门而入，那些未被注意到的木刺扎进皮肤，刺痛并让他微微出血，他对此毫不在意，并未多想。

'There better be something worthwhile in this room,' thought Shinji as he waved his lighter around.  
“这房间里最好有值得一看的东西，”真嗣想着，一边挥动着打火机。

The back room seemed to have escaped whatever had vaporized the front room, and a lot of things were still intact. Shinji walked past several shelves, ignoring the many shoe boxes that lined them, searching for anything that could keep them warm tonight.  
后室似乎逃过了前室被蒸发的命运，许多东西都还完好无损。真嗣走过几排货架，对上面堆满的鞋盒视而不见，寻找着今晚能让他们保暖的任何物品。

Passing into another room, the room had caved in on this one as well, but it was worse; part of the wall had caved in as well. Shinji almost all but ignored this room since it was smaller than the previous room which seemed to just be for storing items, but he saw something which made him do a double take. What look the top half of a chair but with its legs snapped off lay on its side amidst the rubble. Walking over to it, he picked it up and held it in his hands.  
穿过另一间房间，这里同样被坍塌的结构所侵占，情况更为严重；部分墙壁也已崩塌。由于这间房比前一间更小，似乎仅用于存放物品，真嗣几乎忽略了它，但他的目光却被某样东西吸引，不禁多看了两眼。那是一把椅子的上半部分，腿已断裂，侧躺在废墟之中。他走过去，拾起它，双手捧着。

"This must have been a break room or something," mumbled Shinji.  
“这以前一定是间休息室之类的，”真嗣喃喃自语。

He now spotted what he had missed before. A small counter ran along one side of the room and what looked like a sink was built into one of the counter tops. Shinji walked up to it and turned on the faucet without much hope. Predictably, not even a drop of water trickled out.  
他现在注意到了之前忽略的东西。房间一侧有一条小吧台，吧台台面上嵌着一个看起来像水槽的东西。真嗣走过去，没抱太大希望地拧开了水龙头。不出所料，连一滴水都没有流出来。

'Should have know better,' he thought. 'But if there is a sink, it wouldn't be too surprising if a small refrigerator was here.'  
"本该更明白的，" 他心想，"但如果这里有水槽，那么有个小冰箱也不足为奇。"

Shinji then started looking around for any speck of white that stood out compared to the grey and brown colors of the wood and roof tiling. It took him some time before he started shifting pieces of wood, looking for any sign of a fridge.  
真嗣开始四处寻找任何一点与众不同的白色，与周围灰褐色的木头和屋顶瓦片形成对比。他花了些时间，才开始挪动木块，寻找冰箱的踪迹。

After moving several medium sized pieces, he finally found it crammed into a corner of the room. It had long ceased functioning, but if Shinji could find water in there, even if it was to last a day, he would be thankful. Tugging open the door, he was met by such a awful smell that it forced him to veer off to the right as he puked.  
在挪动了几件中等大小的物品后，他终于在一个房间的角落里发现了它。它早已停止运转，但如果真嗣能在里面找到水，哪怕只够维持一天，他也会心怀感激。他用力拉开那扇门，迎面而来的恶臭让他不得不向右偏过头去呕吐。

A rat from the looks of it had somehow found itself a way into the fridge and died during the cave in of the roof. The body was twisted and contorted and its fur was already starting to fall off.  
从外表看来，一只老鼠不知怎地找到了进入冰箱的方法，却在屋顶坍塌时丧命。尸体扭曲变形，毛发已经开始脱落。

Shinji hadn't imagined he would have been greeted by something like this, but at least something good had come out of this. Spitting onto the ground, hating the taste of vomit, he looked back into the fridge and stared at the four water bottles in the inside door. Thankfully, the rat was in a far back corner of the fridge so he wouldn't have to go near it. Forcing himself not to puke again, he quickly grabbed the four bottles. Slamming the door closed, he quickly left the room and held his breath until he reached the item storage room before he breathed again.  
真嗣未曾料想会遭遇这样的情景，但至少有件好事从中而来。他朝地上啐了一口，厌恶那呕吐物的味道，回头望向冰箱内门上的四瓶水。谢天谢地，那只老鼠蜷缩在冰箱深处的一角，他无需靠近。强忍着不再呕吐，他迅速抓起那四瓶水。猛地关上冰箱门，他快步离开房间，屏息直至抵达物品储藏室才重新呼吸。

He looked down at the four bottles tucked in his arms and at least thought that it had been worth it in the end. Setting them down on an empty shelf, he looked around the room again. The room seemed to stretch far into the back and he hadn't checked that area yet.  
他低头看着怀里抱着的四瓶酒，至少觉得最终还是值得的。他将它们放在一个空架子上，再次环顾房间。房间似乎向后方延伸得很远，而他还没有检查过那个区域。

He passed an odd assortment of soccer balls and soccer related products before he reached the back of the store. Camping stuff largely littered this area including some fishing poles. Shinji had never been fishing in his life, but supposed that it was something that would be good to learn. He could at least cook whatever he caught. But carrying the fishing poles would be difficult with the bottles also. He'd just have to grab them again at a later date.  
他在抵达店铺后部之前，经过了一系列奇异的足球及周边产品。露营用品主要散落在这个区域，包括一些钓竿。真嗣一生中从未钓过鱼，但他认为这是一项值得学习的好技能。至少他可以烹饪捕获的任何东西。但同时携带钓竿和瓶子会很困难。他只能改天再来取了。

Sifting through some of the other stuff, he saw a bunch of useless camping gear, none of which included a pot or frying pan. The thought of fish had reminded him of how hungry he was.  
他在一堆其他杂物中翻找，发现了一些无用的露营装备，但没有一个是锅或煎锅。想到鱼，他才意识到自己有多饿。

'Well, I found the water at least, so it wasn't too bad I suppose,' sighed Shinji as he stood up and started walking away from the camping goods. He figured that he should start getting back by now. He wanted be sure the fire stayed strong long into the night.  
'好吧，至少我找到了水，所以还不算太糟，我想。' 真嗣叹了口气，站起身来，开始离开露营用品区。他觉得现在应该开始返回了。他想确保火能持续燃烧到深夜。

As he walked past the camping goods though, his eye caught onto something wrapped in plastic that was tucked into a corner. Walking over to it, Shinji pulled it out and realized that it was a dark green sleeping bag. He smiled slightly, but then looked around.  
当他走过露营用品区时，目光被角落里一个用塑料包裹的东西吸引住了。走过去，真嗣把它抽出来，发现那是一条深绿色的睡袋。他微微一笑，但随即环顾四周。

'There's only one,' he thought suddenly.  
“只有一个，”他突然想到。

He stood still for several seconds, his bran registering that phrase. Of course it wouldn't have been that easy.  
他静立了几秒钟，大脑才处理完那句话。当然，事情不会那么简单。

'Damn it,' he thought as he looked around the store again, waving the flickering flame back and forth. As he passed over everything a second time though, he had to admit defeat. He guessed he wouldn't be sleeping much tonight.  
“该死，”他想着，再次环顾店铺，挥动着那摇曳的火光。尽管第二次仔细检查了一遍，他不得不承认失败。看来今晚他别想睡个好觉了。

Walking back to the door he broke through, he carefully placed the sleeping bag through the hole, being sure not to tear it. Next he threw the bottles through and climbed through the hole, ignoring the splinters which pierced his skin again.  
他走回自己破门而入的地方，小心翼翼地将睡袋从洞口塞过去，确保不会撕裂。接着，他把瓶子扔了过去，然后爬过洞口，不顾那些再次刺入皮肤的木刺。

He didn't notice that the cut from earlier had already scabbed over.  
他没有注意到之前的那道伤口已经结痂了。

After returning to the beach, he tossed what he had found from the city in a pile and started stacking more tinder on the fire. It had gone down more than he had suspected and he figured he'd spend most of his night keeping it alive. After getting it back up to a sizable column though, he turned to other matters.  
回到海滩后，他将城市中找到的东西扔成一堆，开始往火堆上添加更多引火物。火势比他预想的要小，他估计自己多半得花上一整夜来维持火种。不过，在重新将其燃成一柱可观的火焰后，他转而处理其他事务。

He had no way of knowing how far off the sunrise was, but had to guess it was getting close to midnight by now. The moon was already high up in the sky and the chilly ocean breeze was starting to hit the beach. Shinji felt himself shiver as he sat in front of the fire. He had always been rather resilient to the cold, so he could manage well enough...but-  
他无从知晓日出还有多久，但估摸着此刻已近午夜。月亮已高悬天际，寒凉的海风开始侵袭沙滩。真嗣坐在篝火前，感到一阵颤抖。他向来对寒冷颇有抵抗力，因此尚能应付...然而——

He looked at the girl across from him on the other side of the fire pit and frowned. From the moment he had gotten the sleeping bag, he knew things would come to this, but he didn't enjoy it anymore. If anything, he hated it even more.  
他看着火坑对面的女孩，皱起了眉头。自从拿到睡袋的那一刻起，他就知道事情会发展到这一步，但他不再感到享受。如果说有什么不同的话，那就是他更加憎恨这种局面了。

Standing up he grabbed one of the water bottles and opened it, letting several drops of water soothe his parched throat. He wanted to be careful with this water in case they may not find anymore for a while. Placing the bottle beside where he had been sitting, he then grabbed the sleeping bag and removed it from the plastic wrap. He unfurled it and let it hang in front of him surprised at how large it actually was.  
他站起身，拿起一瓶水打开，让几滴水滋润他干渴的喉咙。他想要小心使用这些水，以防他们一段时间内找不到更多的水。他把瓶子放在刚才坐的地方旁边，然后拿起睡袋，从塑料包装中取出。他展开睡袋，让它垂在面前，惊讶于它实际上有多大。

Sighing at what he was about to do, he glanced over at the girl, wishing that she would wake up at that moment. But that was just wishful thinking on his part.  
叹息着自己即将要做的事，他瞥了一眼那女孩，希望她此刻能醒来。但那只是他的一厢情愿罢了。

Walking over to her, he knelt down beside her and laid the sleeping bag out, unzipping it and opening it up. Glancing down at her again he paused for several seconds before he took his arm and slid it under her back, his arm digging into the cool sand and gliding across her back. Shinji had been correct in his assumption that her clothes were made out of some strange elastic. He brought his arm upward now, being careful to not jolt her forward suddenly so that her head lulled from side to side. She was oddly heavy for a girl her age, but Shinji attributed this to the fact that she was unconscious. She seemed rather slim as it was. With her now being propped up in a sitting position, Shinji took his other arm and placed it under her thighs before he counted to three, and lifted her gently in the air before setting her down on the warm sleeping bag. He then zipped up the sleeping bag until it was just below her neck and then leaned backwards, letting out a sigh of relief. He had been worried that she may have woken up during the whole ordeal and couldn't imagine things would have gone very well considering what he was doing.  
他走过去，跪在她身边，展开睡袋，拉开拉链并摊开。再次低头看她时，他停顿了几秒，然后伸出手臂，滑到她背后，手臂陷入凉爽的沙子，轻轻拂过她的背。正如真嗣所料，她的衣服是由某种奇特的弹性材料制成。他小心翼翼地抬起手臂，避免突然晃动她的头部，使她的头轻轻摇摆。对于她这个年纪的女孩来说，她异常沉重，但真嗣将其归因于她昏迷不醒。她看起来相当纤细。现在她被扶成坐姿，真嗣用另一只手臂托住她的大腿，数到三后，轻轻将她抬起，放在温暖的睡袋上。接着，他将睡袋拉链拉到她脖子下方，然后向后一靠，松了口气。他担心整个过程中她可能会醒来，考虑到他在做的事情，情况可能不会太好。

Now that she was wrapped in the sleeping bag though, it really seemed that she was sleeping. Her mouth was slightly agape now revealing her white teeth, and Shinji had to look away. He had been very aware of how close he was to her while he had briefly carried her, almost as though she was a baby.  
如今她裹在睡袋里，看起来真的像是睡着了。她的嘴微微张开，露出洁白的牙齿，这让真嗣不得不移开视线。他一直很清楚自己离她有多近，当他短暂地抱着她时，几乎感觉她像个婴儿一样。

'Don't think like that,' Shinji told himself.  
“别这么想，”真嗣对自己说。

Moving away from her, he sat back down on his side of the fire and stared into the flames. Everything that had happened, everything that was going to happen was so distantly removed from Shinji's conscious that he didn't think of anything as he gazed into the fire.  
他离开她，重新坐回火堆自己那边，凝视着火焰。发生的一切，即将发生的一切，都与真嗣的意识如此遥远，以至于他凝视火光时什么也没想。

It was a short time later before he fell asleep.  
不久后，他便睡着了。

Shinji didn't know whether it was the shrill scream, the loud movement of something being dragged across the sand, or that his throat was suddenly being strangled by thin hands that had woken him up. But he did know one thing.  
真嗣不知道是那尖锐的尖叫声、某物在沙地上拖动的巨大声响，还是突然被纤细的手扼住喉咙的感觉唤醒了他。但他确实知道一件事。

The girl was awake. 女孩醒了。

Shinji's eyes flew open as her grasp on his neck tightened, cutting off the much needed oxygen. He hadn't known when he had fallen asleep, but the fire and burned completely out now and the girl seemed to have dragged herself clear across the still smoldering embers. Shinji's eyes squinted as he fought with his brain, willing it to not cause him to pass out as he looked up at the girl choking him. It was the first time he had seen her eyes, and he momentarily forgot that she was trying to kill him. Her eyes were as clear as the sky, as clear as the ocean had once been. Her face was incredibly hard now though, scrunched up in so much anger that it looked like she was going to explode. A dark crease had appeared upon her forehead, and her pupils were wide and shrunken back into her skull. As Shinji continued to stare at her, he realized that tears had started to leak from her eyes.  
碇的眼眸猛然睁开，她的手紧紧扼住他的脖颈，切断了急需的氧气。他不知何时陷入了沉睡，但此刻篝火已完全熄灭，女孩似乎拖着身子穿过了仍在冒烟的余烬。碇眯起眼睛，与大脑抗争，强迫自己不要昏厥，他抬头望着正扼住他咽喉的女孩。这是他第一次见到她的眼睛，那一瞬间他几乎忘记了她正试图置他于死地。她的眼眸清澈如天空，清澈如曾经的海洋。然而她的面容此刻异常坚硬，因愤怒而扭曲，仿佛即将爆发。她的额头上出现了一道深痕，瞳孔放大，深陷于眼窝之中。碇继续凝视着她，意识到泪水开始从她的眼中渗出。

Reality was brought back quickly to him however, as he felt more pressure being put on his neck. She was strong, stronger that he had imagined, and he could feel his vision starting to leave him.  
然而，现实很快将他拉回，因为他感到脖颈上的压力愈发沉重。她比他想象的还要强壮，他能感觉到自己的视线开始模糊。

'Must...do...something,' he thought desperately.  
“必须...做点...什么，”他绝望地想着。

He opened his mouth to try to say something, but his brain wouldn't produce the words properly with the lack of oxygen.  
他张开嘴试图说些什么，但大脑因缺氧而无法正确组织语言。

'Am I...going to die?' he thought as he glanced up at her face stricken with anger.  
“我会...死吗？”他想着，抬头望向她因愤怒而扭曲的脸。

'No...not like this,' he thought suddenly.  
“不……不是这样，”他突然想到。

Forcing his right arm upward, he pressed it roughly into her chest, forcing her backwards and relinquishing the hold on his neck. Taking a quick gulp of air, he turned towards her just in time as she lunged towards him again, reaching for his neck. He batted her hand away this time and took another breathe of air, feeling his entire head spinning with the sudden burst of oxygen. He felt even more like passing out now.  
他强行将右臂向上推，粗暴地按入她的胸口，迫使她后退并松开了对他的颈部束缚。他迅速深吸一口气，就在她再次扑向他、伸手抓向他的脖子时，他及时转身。这次他拍开了她的手，又吸了一口气，突然涌入的氧气让他感到整个脑袋都在旋转。他现在感觉更加晕眩，几乎要昏过去。

Shaking off the feeling he stared back at her who had moved away from him a little now, but was still glaring hatefully at him, her eyes still filled with anger and if Shinji didn't know better, a death glare. He was now wary, not wanting to get up or move at all, so he sat in a sprawled position on the ground.  
他甩开这种感觉，重新看向她，她现在已经稍微远离了他一些，但仍然用充满仇恨的眼神瞪着他，眼中满是愤怒，如果真嗣不了解情况，可能会以为那是死亡凝视。他现在变得谨慎起来，不想起身或移动分毫，于是就那样四肢摊开坐在地上。

The girl glared back at him still; she was crouched in a sitting position, ready incase he decided to run for it. Only problem was, she wasn't confident that she could catch him if he really decided to run. She shifted position a little though, and winced as she did so. Shinji couldn't help but notice this.  
女孩依旧瞪着他，蹲坐在地上，随时准备在他逃跑时追上去。只是问题在于，她并不确信自己能追上他。尽管如此，她还是稍微调整了下姿势，同时疼得皱了皱眉。这一幕被真嗣看在眼里，无法忽视。

He looked where she looked; down around her legs and all the way to her feet were large dark marks, likely the cause of when she had dragged herself across the fire pit. Shinji couldn't imagine the pain from that, but he suddenly thought of something.  
他顺着她的目光看去；她的双腿周围直至脚边，布满了大片深色痕迹，很可能是她拖着自己穿过篝火堆时留下的。真嗣无法想象那有多痛，但突然间他想到了什么。

Standing up, he stood in place for several seconds as he stared back at the girl several paces in front of him. Next second, he took two steps back, and then three steps back. He then turned and looked at the girl and was surprised to see that she hadn't _gotten up_, but was desperately trying to _get up_. She would place both hands on either side of her, and trying pushing her body upward, but her entire lower body didn't seem to want to listen to her.  
他站起身来，目光紧锁前方几步之遥的女孩，静立数秒。下一刻，他向后退了两步，接着又退了三步。随后，他转头望向女孩，惊讶地发现她并未起身，而是拼命想要站起来。她双手分别撑在身体两侧，试图将身体向上推，但她的下半身似乎完全不听使唤。

'Did she injure herself that badly?' thought Shinji. 'Or was the reason she dragged herself across the fire because she couldn't use her legs to begin with?'  
'她伤得那么重吗？' 真嗣心想。'还是说她之所以拖着身子穿过火海，是因为她原本就无法使用双腿？'

Shinji walked several steps backwards again, testing his theory again. The girl seemed to have given up however, and was now attempting to drag herself forward. As she looked up at him however, she seemed to realize that he knew she couldn't chase after him. She glared back at him, her eyes boring into his until her gaze fell and she slowly shifted her legs so that they were in front of him. The were as heavy as lead, but if she touched them, she couldn't feel any sensation.  
真嗣再次后退了几步，再次验证他的猜想。然而，女孩似乎已经放弃了追逐，现在正试图拖着自己向前移动。但当她抬头看向他时，似乎意识到他已经知道她无法追赶上来。她瞪着他，目光如炬，直到视线低垂，她缓缓调整双腿，让它们横亘在他面前。它们沉重如铅，但当她触碰时，却感觉不到任何知觉。

As Shinji watched this pitifulness, he couldn't help but feel sorry for her as she dragged her legs around so she could sit properly. He was even beginning to wish she had just stayed asleep now that she was awake, and apparently wanted to kill him for some reason.  
当真嗣目睹这一幕可怜兮兮的情景时，看到她费力地拖着双腿以便能端正坐好，他不禁为她感到难过。甚至开始希望她还不如继续睡着，毕竟她现在醒了，还不知为何明显想要杀他。

As the girl finally managed to become comfortable, she redirected her gaze at Shinji as he stood in front of her. She hating this feeling of being completely merciless in front of some stranger she didn't even know. To wake up and find somebody asleep close to her, without knowing anything about them or what they had possibly done. It made her so sick she wanted to puke.  
当女孩终于设法感到自在时，她重新将目光投向站在她面前的真嗣。她讨厌这种在完全陌生的人面前毫无防备的感觉，一个她甚至不认识的陌生人。醒来时发现有人睡在身边，却对他们一无所知，也不知道他们可能做过什么。这让她恶心得想吐。

Shinji watched her silently, his hands at his sides. He was unsure what to do in a situation like this. Having never gotten along well with humans in general, having a girl suddenly try to strangle him to death was a situation he hadn't imagined himself being in.  
真嗣默默地注视着她，双手垂在身侧。他不知道在这种情况下该怎么做。一直以来与人类相处得并不融洽，突然有个女孩试图勒死他，这种情形他从未设想过会发生在自己身上。

'We can't just stay like this forever though,' thought Shinji as he sighed.  
"我们不能就这样永远待下去啊。" 真嗣叹了口气，心想。

Resigning to that fact, he sat down slowly, make sure the girl wouldn't try to go after him as he did this. She seemed to be somewhat surprised that he was sitting down now though, as her eyes widened slightly, but then quickly went back to that death stare.  
无奈接受这一事实，他缓缓坐下，确保女孩不会趁机追上来。她似乎对他此刻坐下的举动有些惊讶，眼睛微微睁大，但很快又恢复了那副死寂的凝视。

They sat across from each other now, both watching each other. The girl had been initially surprised that Shinji hadn't just ran away, letting her die in that undignified way. But instead he had sat down, bringing himself down to her level. That pissed her off even more though; he was pitying her.  
他们现在面对面坐着，彼此凝视。女孩起初对真嗣没有直接逃跑，任由她以那种不体面的方式死去感到惊讶。但他却坐了下来，让自己与她平视。这让她更加恼火；他在怜悯她。

'I have to say something,' thought Shinji. 'But what do I say to this girl who just tried to kill me?'  
'我得说点什么，' 真嗣心想。'但对刚刚试图杀我的这个女孩，我该说什么呢？'

Shinji didn't have a clue what to do, but didn't think this was a time to introduce himself. Looking back at her, he saw that her gaze had switched to her legs. She was examining them slowly, moving her hands over the black burns across her legs and feet. She seemed slightly more calm now as she did this, but Shinji noticed that her right eye kept flickering back to him.  
真嗣完全不知道该怎么办，但觉得现在不是自我介绍的时候。他回头看她，发现她的目光已经转向了自己的双腿。她慢慢地检查着，双手在腿上和脚上的黑色烧伤处来回移动。这样做似乎让她稍微平静了一些，但真嗣注意到她的右眼不时地瞥向他。

'She doesn't trust me,' thought Shinji. He should have expected this somewhat, and rather wished he hadn't fallen asleep.  
“她不信任我，”真嗣心想。他本该预料到这一点的，更希望自己没有睡着。

Though an idea came to him then.  
虽然那时他脑海中闪过一个念头。

Standing up again, the girls head came whipping around as her eyes locked on him, watching his every movement. Shinji watched her calmly before he started walking along in a wide half circle around the right side of her; her head followed him as he walked. Walking in a wide arc, he walked all the way around her to the point that she was desperately trying to look behind her but unable to see without repositioning her body. She stopped though as he came back into her field of wish. In his hands he held two bottles.  
再次站起身，女孩的头猛地转向他，目光紧锁在他身上，观察着他的一举一动。真嗣平静地注视着她，然后开始沿着她的右侧走一个大半圆；她的头随着他的步伐转动。他以一个大弧度绕行，直到她拼命想看向身后却无法在不调整身体的情况下看到。然而，当他重新进入她的视野时，她停了下来。他的手中拿着两瓶水。

Shinji sat down again several paces in front of her and placed both water bottles next to him before he open his and took a draught out of it. The water felt cool as it slid down his throat which was still sore from when she had been choking him. Setting down his bottle, he looked across at her and saw that she wasn't looking at him angrily anymore. Her expression was one of confusion.  
真嗣再次坐下，与她相隔几步之遥，将两瓶水放在身边，然后打开自己的那瓶，喝了一口。水流过他因她之前的窒息而仍感疼痛的喉咙，带来一丝凉意。放下水瓶，他望向她，发现她不再以愤怒的眼神看着他。她的表情充满了困惑。

'What is wrong with her?' wondered Shinji almost somewhat amusedly.  
"'她怎么了？' 真嗣几乎有些好笑地想着。

Shinji waited several more seconds before he picked up the other water bottle he had brought, and rolled it across the sand; the bottle bumped gently into the girls knee. She stared down at it for several seconds, her face a mixture of expressions.  
真嗣又等了几秒钟，然后拿起他带来的另一瓶水，滚过沙地；瓶子轻轻撞到了女孩的膝盖。她低头盯着它看了几秒钟，脸上表情复杂。

"Drink it," said Shinji tonelessly.  
“喝吧，”真嗣面无表情地说。

The girls eyes darted towards him, surprised to hear a human voice. Shinji stared back and nodded his head slowly. The girl looked back down at the water bottle before picking it up in her hands. She looked at the cap for several seconds before determining it hadn't been opened before. Quickly opening it, she took several long swallows, just realizing then how thirsty she was. The water slid down her throat, moistening her lips in the process until she paused and removed the bottle from her lips. She slowly set the bottle down next to her, but didn't remove her grip on the bottle. She looked back at Shinji then, a frown on her face.  
女孩的目光迅速转向他，惊讶于听到人类的声音。真嗣回望着她，缓缓点头。女孩再次低头看向水瓶，然后将其拿起。她盯着瓶盖看了几秒，确认未曾被打开过。迅速旋开瓶盖，她连喝了几大口，这才意识到自己有多渴。水滑过喉咙，滋润着她的双唇，直到她停下，将瓶子从唇边移开。她慢慢将水瓶放在身旁，但并未松开握瓶的手。随后，她再次看向真嗣，眉头微皱。

'Is it really that strange for someone to do something like this?' thought Shinji as he looked back at her. He hadn't really expected to receive words of thanks, but knowing that she could at least talk would have been something.  
"有人这么做真的很奇怪吗？" 真嗣想着，回头看向她。他并没有真的期待听到感谢的话语，但知道她至少能开口说话，也算是件好事。

Ignoring this, he raised his own bottle to lips and was about to take a drink when-  
他对此置之不理，举起自己的瓶子送到唇边，正要喝上一口时——

"Where are we?" asked the girl with a clear voice.  
“我们在哪儿？”女孩用清脆的声音问道。

Shinji looked at her for a second through his raised bottle before he lowered it slowly and looked back at her. She was looking determinedly at him now.  
真嗣透过举起的酒瓶看了她一秒钟，然后慢慢放下酒瓶，再次看向她。她此刻正坚定地注视着他。

Shinji took several seconds to reply until he looked across the beach to the bloodied ocean and said-  
真嗣过了几秒才回答，他望向染血的海岸线，说道——

"Tokyo-3, I think." “第三新东京市，我想。”

His eyes darted back to her as he said this, he saw that her eyes had widened slightly as he said this. Was she equally confused and surprised as he was by this, or did her eyes hold a different meaning?  
他说这话时，目光迅速回到她身上，发现她的眼睛微微睁大了。她是否也像他一样感到困惑和惊讶，还是她的眼神蕴含着不同的含义？

They sat in silence again, sipping there water quietly, but as Shinji quickly noticed, both bottles had almost been emptied already. Looks like he'd be looking for more water before the day ended. So much for saving it.  
他们再次静静地坐着，小口啜饮着水，但正如真嗣很快注意到的那样，两个瓶子几乎都快空了。看来今天结束前他得去找更多的水了。省水的计划算是泡汤了。

"Why is no one here?" asked the girl again.  
“为什么这里一个人都没有？”女孩再次问道。

Shinji turned towards her and replied, "I don't know. You're the only other person I've seen, and I was up in the city for these,' he said as he gestured to the water bottles.  
真嗣转向她，回答道：“我不知道。你是除了我之外唯一见过的人，而我之前在城里就是为了这些。”他说着，指了指那些水瓶。

The girl looked at him for several seconds before she turned away from him. Shinji thought he might have seen her mutter something under her breath, but he couldn't hear what it was.  
女孩盯着他看了几秒钟，然后转过身去。真嗣觉得他可能看到她在低声嘀咕什么，但他没听清内容。

Looking at her legs he couldn't think of anything else to say so he asked, "How are your legs?"  
看着她的双腿，他想不出还有什么可说的，于是问道：“你的腿怎么样了？”

The girl glared back at him for a few seconds, not enjoying the question, but he already knew that she couldn't move, so ignoring it was pointless.  
女孩瞪了他几秒钟，不喜欢这个问题，但他已经知道她动不了，所以无视它是没有意义的。

"I can't move them." “我动不了它们。”

Shinji already knew this, but he still pressed the subject.  
真嗣其实已经知道这一点，但他还是继续追问。

"Were they already like that before you-"  
“在你之前，他们就已经那样了吗？”

Shinji hesitated; he had been about to say before you tried strangling me.  
真嗣犹豫了一下；他本想说在你试图勒死我之前。

"-before you crawled across the fire."  
"-在你爬过火堆之前。"

The girl continued glaring at him, but eventually replied, "They were already like this."  
女孩继续瞪着他，但最终回答道，"它们本来就是这样的。"

Shinji didn't think that pushing this further would do any good. Admittedly though, her being basically crippled was a problem, and he was worried about her legs, but if she didn't want to talk about it, he would just wait. He could understand that, as he certainly had things he didn't want to talk about.  
真嗣不认为继续追问会有什么好处。不过，她几乎瘫痪的状况确实是个问题，他对她的双腿感到担忧，但如果她不想谈，他会耐心等待。他理解这一点，因为他自己也有不想提及的事情。

Shinji stood up then, stretching his body and relieving the tension that was building between them just now. The girl watched him silently as he walked several paces away from her towards the ocean. She let out a small sigh herself then; she had been incredibly nervous since the moment she had awoken.  
真嗣随后站起身来，伸展身体，缓解了刚才两人之间的紧张气氛。女孩默默地看着他走向海边，离她几步之遥。她自己也轻轻叹了口气；自从醒来那一刻起，她就一直非常紧张。

Shinji looked out across the ocean for several more seconds before he walked back to where the girl sat. She watched him as he passed by her and started walking towards the slope to the right of where they had sat. She shifted her body slightly, watching as he climbed the hill and was momentarily thinking that he was walking away, that he had made a decision to leave her when he bent over and picked something up. Several seconds later, he came jogging back down the hill, his arms filled with dry brush.  
真嗣又凝视了一会儿海面，才转身走向女孩坐着的地方。她注视着他从身边经过，开始朝他们所坐之处右侧的斜坡走去。她微微调整了姿势，看着他爬上山丘，心中掠过一丝念头，以为他要离开，决定抛下她，然而他却弯腰捡起了什么。几秒钟后，他抱着一捆干枯的灌木，小跑着下了山坡。

The words 'what are you doing,' were half formed in her mouth before her hand brushed against something. Picking it up, she realized it was a lighter, and understood then what he was doing.  
她刚要开口问“你在做什么”，手却无意间触碰到了什么东西。拾起一看，是个打火机，她这才明白他在做什么。

Shinji walked back several seconds later with his arms full of dried drift wood. Dropping everything on the ground, he was about to look for the lighter when he realized it was in the girls hands. There eyes met, and for several seconds, Shinji was afraid that she wasn't going to give it to him. Silently, he held his hand out asking for it. He knew she must understand what he was doing by now, but was never truly sure whether sure she would give it to him. It took her several seconds until she dropped the lighter in his hands wordlessly.  
几秒钟后，真嗣抱着满怀的干漂流木回来了。他将所有东西扔在地上，正准备找打火机时，才发现它在女孩手里。他们的目光相遇，有那么几秒钟，真嗣担心她不会把打火机给他。他默默地伸出手，示意她递过来。他知道她现在肯定明白他的意图，但始终不确定她是否会给他。她犹豫了几秒钟，终于无声地将打火机放在他手中。

Shinji didn't bother saying thanks, as he knew she had been close to not giving it to him. Was she that unable to trust him?  
真嗣没有费心道谢，因为他知道她差点就没给他。她真的那么不信任他吗？

Lighting the fire quickly, he stood back for several seconds watching as the flames licked the wood. Across from him, the girl stared into the flames.  
他迅速点燃了火，后退几步，注视着火焰舔舐木柴。对面，女孩凝视着火光。

Looking down at her, Shinji thought, 'This is a good a time as any I suppose.'  
低头看着她，真嗣心想，'我想这正是时候吧。'

Sitting down across the fire from her, Shinji placed his hands on his knees and said, "Look...as much as you don't trust me, and I have to say, I don't really trust you either, we seem to be the only two people in the entire city. What I guess I'm trying to say is...we have to at least stay together until we're able to find more people."  
坐在火堆对面，真嗣将双手放在膝盖上，说道：“听着……尽管你不太信任我，我得承认，我对你也没多少信任，但我们似乎是这座城市里仅有的两个人。我想说的是……在我们找到更多人之前，至少得待在一起。”

"And if nobody else comes?" asked the girl, her voice suddenly growing in volume.  
"如果其他人都不来呢？"女孩问道，声音突然提高了。

Shinji was trying to be optimistic, but the way she said that made him pissed off for some reason.  
真嗣试图保持乐观，但她那番话不知为何让他莫名恼火。

"You don't believe anybody else will come?"  
“你不相信还会有人来吗？”

The girl didn't reply, already having spoken her mind.  
女孩没有回答，她已经表达了自己的想法。

Shinji stared back at her for a few seconds, wondering what could possibly have made her so inept in dealing with other people. He wasn't a role model by any means, but he at least did want to survive.  
真嗣盯着她看了几秒，心中疑惑究竟是什么让她在与人相处时如此笨拙。他自知绝非榜样，但至少他确实渴望生存。

After several seconds of silence, Shinji finally opened his mouth and muttered, "Shinji...Shinji is my name."  
沉默了几秒后，真嗣终于张开嘴，低声说道：“真嗣……真嗣是我的名字。”

The girl slowly raised her head and looked back at him. Her face was blank as she stared back at him.  
女孩缓缓抬起头，回头望向他。她面无表情地凝视着他。

Her small mouth eventually opened as she replied, "Asuka, is mine."  
她的小嘴终于张开，回答道：“这是明日香的。”

They both looked into the fire for several seconds before Shinji stood up and grabbed the sleeping bag and walked around the fire. The girl, Asuka, watched him as he did this and was momentarily surprised when he handed it to her.  
他们俩都盯着火堆看了几秒钟，随后真嗣站起身，抓起睡袋绕过火堆走去。女孩，明日香，看着他这么做，当真嗣将睡袋递给她时，她一时有些惊讶。

"Wrap yourself in this," Shinji said.  
"用这个把自己裹起来，" 真嗣说道。

Asuka watched his eyes for several seconds, searching for any hint of malicious intent in his eyes, though she couldn't find anything. She didn't really like accepting this from him, but she took it all the same.  
明日香盯着他的眼睛看了好几秒，试图从中寻找一丝恶意，却一无所获。她其实并不喜欢接受他的这份好意，但还是接了过来。

Shinji then walked to where he had been sitting, and bent down and grabbed the lighter before he stood up again.  
真嗣随后走向他之前坐的地方，弯腰捡起打火机，然后再次站直身子。

"Though it is still early in the morning, I'm going to enter the city again. By tonight both water bottles will be gone and I can search in daylight better than night anyways."  
虽然清晨尚早，我打算再次进城。到今晚，两个水壶的水都将耗尽，无论如何，白天的搜索总比夜晚更有效。
